Future Humans

Jin Zi

Humans evolved gradually from ancient apes more than a million years ago. But what will humans become in a hundred thousand years, or even a million years?

Many "scientists" have answered this question from various perspectives and have given future humans a scientific name: "Future Humans." They believe that "Future Humans" will be very tall with large heads and no teeth. Their hands will only have three fingers: the thumb, index finger, and middle finger. The little toe will also be degenerated, leaving only four toes. Each finger and toe will only have two joints. They will only have one rib left, and the fibula will only have a small section at the top...

These assumptions of theirs seem to have "sufficient scientific basis." They say:

First, many animals grow in size from small to large, such as horses, elephants, and camels. Many animals have fewer and fewer toes: primitive vertebrates should have seven toes, which evolved to the normal five, and some have only four, three, two, or even only one.

Second, future humans will use their brains more and more, so their heads will naturally become larger; the little finger, ring finger, and little toe will be used less, and they will inevitably shrink and degenerate. Also, in the future, with the development of science, a kind of "nutritional pill" can be manufactured. People will swallow one every day, just like we swallow "vitamin pills" now. Therefore, there will be no need for chewing, and teeth will gradually degenerate.

Third, according to some individual variations in modern people, we can also see the direction of future changes. For example, "wisdom teeth" (the last molars) erupt later, some people have small "wisdom teeth" or none at all, and some people have other teeth besides wisdom teeth that are also very small or missing.

In this way, the number of teeth will degenerate from thirty-two to twenty-eight, twenty-four,... until there are none at all. There are similar "scientific bases" for ribs and fibulas.

All of the above sounds reasonable, but in reality, it is not.

There is an essential difference between humans and animals: animals only adapt to nature; the fittest survive, and the unfit are eliminated. But humans can transform nature and make nature adapt to themselves. Therefore, we must not apply the laws of animal evolution to humans in the same way.

After horses went from forests to grasslands, some became taller, and some remained as short as when they lived in the forests. The shorter ones ran slower and were eaten by predators; the taller ones ran faster and survived. This was passed down from generation to generation, and the horses became taller and taller.

But who can eat humans? In the past, with their wisdom, they would unite to deal with beasts and use labor-created tools to conquer nature (of course, some people were eaten by tigers, but the life and death of individuals did not determine the fate of the entire human race). In the future, beasts will be domesticated, and nature will be increasingly subject to human control. Therefore, human bodies will never become particularly tall. Moreover, according to the research of paleoanthropologists, the height of ancient humans and modern humans is similar; there is no trend of becoming particularly tall.

They believe that "the more the brain is used, the bigger the head will become; the less the limbs and teeth are used, the more they will degenerate." This is a bourgeois ideological consciousness that despises physical labor. They believe that mental labor is supreme, and in the future, everything will be automated; people will only need to press buttons every day, and no physical labor will be required. But we believe that after the advent of a communist society, the difference between mental and physical labor will disappear, and the body will be fully developed. Production will be automated, and machines will replace heavy labor, but this does not mean that there will be no more physical labor, let alone that people will only need to press buttons every day. Appropriate physical labor is always necessary. What's more, there are all kinds of recreational and sports activities, such as playing ball, playing the piano, etc. Therefore, human limbs will become more flexible and developed, rather than increasingly degenerated.

Of course, with the highly developed production, people will have more time to engage in scientific and cultural activities, and people will become smarter, and their brains will become more developed. But brain development does not mean the unlimited increase in the volume and weight of the brain.

Let's compare human brains with animal brains! The average modern human brain weighs about 1,400 grams, while the brain of a whale weighs 6,000 to 7,000 grams, and the brain of an elephant weighs more than 4,000 grams. The brains of these animals are much heavier than human brains; if calculated by relative weight (the percentage of brain weight to body weight), the relative weight of human brains is much smaller than that of small birds and mice. But human intelligence is obviously not comparable to these animals.

Comparing ancient and modern humans, the brains of many ancient humans were heavier than the brains of modern humans. For example, the brain of Neanderthals weighed about 1,300 to 1,650 grams (Neanderthals are a kind of human between apes and modern humans. They lived about 100,000 to 200,000 years ago and were widely distributed in Europe, represented by human fossils found in the caves of the Neanderthal Valley in Germany). This is heavier than the brains of many modern people. Can we say that Neanderthals were smarter than modern people?

Even among modern people, there are big-headed idiots and small-headed smart people. The Russian writer Turgenev had a brain weighing 2,012 grams, but the French writer A. France's brain weighed only 1,017 grams. It can be seen that the development of the brain does not depend solely on the size of the brain. Generally speaking, after the human brain reaches a certain weight, the development of intelligence no longer depends on the increase in quantity but on the change in quality. For individuals, social education is also extremely important. Therefore, the claim that the heads of future humans will become very large is unreliable.

The changes in teeth will certainly not be as imagined by bourgeois scientists. With the increasing development of production, people's lives will become richer and more colorful, and food will become more diverse. Some people like to eat soft food, but some people prefer to eat crispy food. No one is happy to swallow a "nutritional pill" every day to replace delicious meals.

It is also wrong to conclude that this is the beginning of the changes of "Future Humans" based on some individual variations found in modern people. Take the "wisdom teeth" mentioned above! According to the research of paleoanthropologists, the "wisdom teeth" of Neanderthals were also not developed and erupted relatively late, but their "wisdom teeth" did not disappear.

In short, future humans, even those a million years from now, will not become as strangely shaped as speculated by bourgeois scholars in terms of their entire body, except for some extremely unimportant parts that may change. On the contrary, with the development of communist society and the increasing development of science, people will become smarter, more beautiful, purer, stronger, and longer-lived—this is certain.

    未来的人
    进子
    人是百多万年以前，从古猿逐渐进化来的，可是十万年，甚至一百万年以后，人又会变成什么样子呢？
    很多“科学家”对这个问题从各方面作了解答，并且给将来的人取了一个学名，叫做“未来人”。他们认为：“未来人”身材很高，脑袋很大，没有牙齿。手只剩下大拇指、食指、中指三个指头，脚的小趾也退化了，只剩下四个脚趾。每个手指和脚趾都只有两节。肋骨只剩下一根，腓骨也只留下上面一小段了，……
    他们的这些假设，似乎都是有着“充足的科学根据”的。他们说：
    第一，很多动物的身材都是从小到大的，如马、象、骆驼都是这样。很多动物的脚趾都是从多到少的：原始脊椎动物应当有七个脚趾，进化到正常的为五个，有的只有四个、三个、两个，甚至少到只有一个。
    第二，将来的人用脑愈来愈多，脑袋自然要愈变愈大；小指、无名指和小脚趾用得少，必然也要萎缩和退化。还有，将来科学发达，可以制造一种“营养丸”，每天吞服一颗，就像我们现在吞服“维他命丸”似的，因此用不着咀嚼，牙齿也就逐渐退化了。
    第三，根据现代人中的一些个体变异，也可以看出将来的变化方向。例如“智齿”（最后一颗臼齿）都生出较迟，有的人“智齿”很小或者根本不出，有的人除了智齿外，还有别的牙齿也是很小或者没有。
    这样，牙齿就将由三十二个退化到二十八个，二十四个，……以至完全没有。关于肋骨和腓骨也有类似的“科学根据”。
    所有以上这些，听起来似乎有着一番道理，实际上却不然。
    人和动物是有着本质的区别的：动物只是适应自然，适者生存，不适者淘汰，可是人却能改造自然，使自然来适应自己，因此决不能把动物的进化规律照样搬到人身上来。
    马从森林到草原以后，有的变得高大些，有的还像在森林生活时候那么矮小。矮小的跑得慢些，被猛兽吃掉了；身体高大些的，跑得快些，就保存下来了。这样一代传一代，马的身体也就越来越高大了。
    可是人，谁还能来吃掉他呢？过去，他们凭着自己的智慧，会集合起来对付猛兽，用劳动创造的工具来征服自然（当然，有人被老虎吃掉的事，但是个别人的生死，并不决定整个人类的命运）。今后，猛兽都将被驯化，自然界将愈来愈多地服从人的驾驭，因此，人的身体决不会变得特别高大的。何况，根据古人类学家的研究，古代人和现代人的身材高矮是差不多的，并没有变得特别高大的趋势。
    他们认为“脑子用得多，脑袋会越来越大，四肢、牙齿用得少，会越来越退化”，这正是一种资产阶级轻视体力劳动的思想意识。他们认为脑力劳动至上，将来一切都自动化了，人们每天只要按按电钮，不再需要什么体力劳动了。可是我们认为：到了共产主义社会以后，脑力劳动和体力劳动的差别将会消灭，身体将会得到全面的发展。生产自动化了，机器将代替笨重的劳动，但是并不等于说不再有体力劳动，更不等于说每天只要按按电钮就行了。适当的体力劳动永远是必要的。何况还有各种各样的文娱体育活动呢？如打球、弹琴等等。因此人的四肢将变得更加灵活、发达，而不是越来越退化。
    当然，随着生产高度的发展，人们会有更多的时间从事科学文化活动，人将变得更加聪明，脑子也将更加发达。但是脑子发达并不等于说脑子的体积和重量的无限增加。
    以人脑和动物脑比较一下吧！现代人脑平均重约一千四百克，而鲸的脑重六千至七千克，象的脑重四千多克，这些动物的脑都比人脑重得多；如果按相对重（脑重和体重的百分比）计算，人脑的相对重比小鸟、小鼠的又小得多。可是人类的智力显然不是这些动物所可比拟的。
    再就古今人类来比较，很多古代人类的脑量都比现代人的脑子重些，如尼安德特人的脑重约为一千三百至一千六百五十克（尼安德特人是介于猿人和现代人之间的一种人类，他们的生活时代离现在约一二十万年，曾经广泛分布于欧洲，以德国尼安德特河谷的洞穴中找到的人类化石为代表），比很多现代人的脑还重，能说尼安德特人比现代人聪明吗？
    就是现代人中也有大脑袋的白痴和小脑袋的聪明人。俄国文学家屠格涅夫，脑重固然有二千零一十二克，可是法国文学家A·法朗士的脑子却只有一千零一十七克重。可见脑子的发达，并不单纯依靠脑量的大小。一般说来，人类脑重达到一定量以后，智力的发达，就不再是依靠量的增长，而是依靠质的变化了。就个别人来说，社会的教育也有极大的关系。因此，未来人的脑袋会变得很大的说法是不可靠的。
    牙齿的变化也决不是像资产阶级科学家所想像的那样。随着生产的日益发达，人的生活将越来越丰富多彩，食物也将越来越多样化。固然有的人喜欢吃软，可是有的人偏爱吃脆的，谁也不高兴一天吞服一颗“营养丸”来代替美味的饭食的。
    根据现代人中发现的一些个体变异的例子，就肯定这是“未来人”变化的萌芽也是不对的。就拿上面所说的“智齿”来说吧！根据古人类学家的研究，尼安德特人的“智齿”也不发达，生出也比较迟，可是他们的“智齿”并没有消失。
    总而言之，将来的人，即使是一百万年以后的人，除了个别极不重要的部分，可能有些变化外，就整个身体来说，决不会变得像资产阶级学者所臆测的那样奇形怪状。相反地，随着共产主义社会的发展，科学的日益发达，人将变得更加聪明、美丽、纯洁、健壮而长寿——这是可以肯定的。
