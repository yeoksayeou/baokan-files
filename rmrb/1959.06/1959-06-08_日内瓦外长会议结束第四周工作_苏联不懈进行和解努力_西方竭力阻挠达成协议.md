Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, 7th Dispatch: Our Correspondent Wan Guang Reports: As the Geneva Eastern and Western Foreign Ministers' Conference concludes its fourth week of work, the conference has reached the stage where decisions should be made. Currently, both inside and outside the conference, the struggle between the two lines – striving for the conference to reach positive results and trying one's best to obstruct and undermine the reaching of an agreement – is becoming increasingly acute.

    The informal talks and plenary sessions discussing the West Berlin issue have continued for more than a week. The series of proposals put forward by the Soviet Union on the normalization of the West Berlin situation have opened the way for reaching a reasonable agreement on this issue. The Soviet Union's request at the plenary session on the 5th for Western countries to clarify their specific attitudes towards not using force in international disputes and establishing a restricted armaments zone in Europe is another effort by the Soviet Union to seek beneficial progress in the conference. However, as these rays of light illuminating the conference's progress become stronger, those stubborn forces in Western countries who insist on remaining in the dark cave of the Cold War are becoming increasingly anxious, desperately trying to block the Soviet Union's efforts for reconciliation. These days, it can be seen that this force is organizing a broad and mutually reinforcing movement in various different places in the West to exert pressure on the Foreign Ministers' Conference.

    In Washington, Eisenhower declared at a press conference on the 3rd that the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference has not yet made enough progress for the West to agree to hold a summit meeting. This openly threatening talk was "warmly welcomed" by some Western figures here who are deliberately obstructing the conference's progress, who regarded it as a general signal for the broad movement they were expecting. Subsequently, in Bonn, Adenauer's sudden announcement to continue occupying the seat of West German Chancellor brought this movement to another peak. In London, certain forces in British political circles who are colluding with the most rigid groups in the United States and West German militarists deliberately released information through "The Times" that Lloyd, who is currently negotiating in Geneva, will soon be replaced, which is also related to this movement.

    Following Eisenhower's line, Herter talked at length at the plenary session on the 5th about the United States' unyielding "principles" on the West Berlin issue. Herter even revived the already stagnant "package deal", advocating that the conference conduct a general discussion on this plan again. There can be no other explanation for Herter's doing this other than to show that he is attempting to reverse the conference.

    The West German delegation has also been even more rampant in undermining the conference these days. Even while an informal meeting of the four foreign ministers was being held, the West German spokesperson could not wait to convene a press conference, insisting that the informal meeting had made no progress, clamoring that the West must not make any concessions on the West Berlin issue, that the conference "may be fruitless," and so on. When Adenauer discovered that even these rogue tactics could not completely create the situation he hoped for at the conference, he suddenly decided that he must continue to stay in the position of Chancellor in order to "hold the situation." People in the West German delegation here do not shy away from saying that the slight possibility of the Foreign Ministers' Conference reaching an agreement is one of the reasons why Adenauer, the "most stubborn knight of the Cold War," made this decision.

    Many business-minded politicians in the West are still openly treating the issues discussed at the Foreign Ministers' Conference as objects of bargaining, attempting to rely on the so-called "exerting pressure" movement to obtain "concessions" from the Soviet Union and make the Soviet Union "pay the price for holding a summit meeting." However, anyone who has not lost their sense of reality will know that these despicable and hateful tricks have no chance of succeeding. Those "exerting pressure" in the West are doing their best to put on a "tough" appearance in propaganda, but unfortunately for them, they are by no means in a "tough" position themselves.

    While American newspapers are repeatedly demanding that "the West must unite and show toughness," influential U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Fulbright openly stated that he disagreed with Eisenhower's talk of imposing preconditions on convening a summit meeting. He said that even if the current Geneva Conference does not achieve anything, it "should not be the sole reason for no longer attempting to seek some achievements at a higher level." British Labour MP Crossman ridiculed Eisenhower in the "Daily Mirror" on the 5th as a person who whistles to embolden himself, saying that he speaks toughly but stands on a weak position. The decision of Adenauer from the West German side to remain as Prime Minister has once again aroused strong dissatisfaction and attacks from the British bourgeois newspapers. The "Daily Express" accused Adenauer's decision of being "against Britain's policy towards Russia." The "News Chronicle" said, "We have vivid memories of what can happen in Germany when 'government gives way to one man's domination.'"

    Even within the ruling groups in West Germany, contradictions and disarray are constantly growing. Adenauer government’s die-hard approach at the Geneva Conference has not only been condemned by the domestic opposition parties, but also opposed by many prominent figures within Adenauer's Christian Democratic Union. Adenauer's arrest of opponents in his party and his forced adoption of the decision to remain as Chancellor, despite the widespread dissatisfaction and aversion within the party, only demonstrates the fragility of Adenauer's position and will only lead him into a more isolated position.

    The root cause of the current divisions and confusion among Western countries and within each country is that some political figures in these countries see that the people are strongly demanding that the Foreign Ministers' Conference achieve positive results, and that violating the will of the people will lead to serious consequences. Some people have also seen more clearly that the West is not in a "position of strength" when dealing with the Soviet Union today, and that the more the West delays the resolution of the problem, the more passive and embarrassed they will become. Now that the Eastern and Western Foreign Ministers are about to begin the fifth week of the conference, it is time for the Western Foreign Ministers to correct their attitude.

### 日内瓦外长会议结束第四周工作  苏联不懈进行和解努力  西方竭力阻挠达成协议

    日内瓦外长会议结束第四周工作
    苏联不懈进行和解努力
    西方竭力阻挠达成协议
    新华社日内瓦7日电　本社记者万光报道：在日内瓦东西方国家外长会议结束第四周工作的时候，会议已经到达应该作出决定的阶段了。目前，在会内外，争取会议达成积极结果以及竭力阻挠破坏达成协议的两条路线间的斗争，益形尖锐。
    讨论西柏林问题的非正式会谈和全体会议已经延续了一个多星期。苏联在使西柏林局势正常化问题上提出的一系列建议，为在这个问题上达成合理的协议开辟了道路。苏联5日在全体会议上要求西方国家澄清它们对在国际争端中不使用武力和在欧洲建立限制军备区这两个问题的具体态度，是苏联谋求会议取得有益进展的又一努力。但是，当这些照射着会议前进的光芒愈加强烈的时候，那些坚持要呆在冷战黑窟里的西方国家的顽固势力却愈加焦急，拼命要阻拦苏联的和解努力。这几天，可以看到，这种势力在西方各个不同的地方，组织起一个广泛的、相互呼应的运动，来对外长会议施加压力。
    在华盛顿，艾森豪威尔3日在记者招待会上宣称。日内瓦外长会议迄今还没有取得进展，足以使西方同意举行最高级会议。这个公然威胁性的谈话，受到了在这里的西方某些蓄意阻挠会议前进的人士的“热烈欢迎”，认为这是他们所期待的广泛运动的一个总信号。接着，在波恩，阿登纳突然宣布要继续占着西德总理座位不放，使这个运动又进入一个高峰。在伦敦，英国政界中某些同美国最僵硬的集团和西德军国主义者串通一气的势力，故意通过“泰晤士报”放出不久要撤换掉正在日内瓦谈判的劳埃德的空气，也是同这个运动有着联系的。
    遵循艾森豪威尔谈话的路线，赫脱在5日全体会议上大谈美国在西柏林问题上绝不让步的这个那个“原则”。赫脱甚至重新抬出已经僵死了的“一揽子计划”来，主张会议再对这个计划进行一般性讨论。赫脱这样做，除了表明他企图使会议倒退外，不能有别的解释。
    西德代表团这些天来也更加猖狂地对会议进行破坏。甚至在四国外长的某次非正式会议正在举行的时候，西德发言人便急不及待地召集起记者招待会来，硬说非正式会议没有进展，叫嚷西方在西柏林问题上绝不能让步，会议“可能毫无结果”等等。当阿登纳发现连这种无赖手段还不能使会议完全出现他所希望的情景时，他便猛然决定，他必须继续呆在总理职位上，以便“顶住局面”。这里的西德代表团人士并不讳言，外长会议达成协议的微弱的可能性，是阿登纳这个“冷战最顽强的骑士”作出决定的原因之一。
    西方不少满脑袋生意经的政客们，目前竟还在公开把外长会议上讨论的问题当作讨价还价的对象，他们企图靠所谓“施加压力”运动，来取得苏联“让步”，使苏联“为举行最高级会议付出代价”。然而，任何没有丧失现实感的人都会知道，这种卑劣可恶的伎俩是没有丝毫得逞的机会的。西方这些“施加压力”者在宣传上竭力摆出一副“强硬”的样子，但是对于他们说来十分不幸的是，他们自己却绝不是处于“强硬”的地位上。
    当美国报纸一再要求“西方必须团结一致表现强硬”的时候，有影响的美国参议院外交委员会主席富布赖特便公开表示，他不同意艾森豪威尔给召开最高级会议强加先决条件的谈话。他说，即使目前的日内瓦会议没有取得成就，也“不应当成为不再试图在更高一级谋求一些成就的唯一理由”。英国工党议员克罗斯曼5日在“每日镜报”上嘲笑艾森豪威尔是一个借吹口哨壮胆的人，说他话讲得很强硬，但是站立的却是一个虚弱的阵地。来自西德方面的阿登纳留任总理的决定，又激起了英国资产阶级报纸的强烈不满和攻击。“每日快报”指责阿登纳的决定是“为了反对英国的对俄国的政策”。“新闻纪事报”说，当“政府让位给一个人支配时，德国会发生什么情况，我们对此都有鲜明的记忆。”
    即使在西德国内统治集团中，矛盾和纷乱也在不断增长。阿登纳政府在日内瓦会议上的死硬作法，不仅遭到国内反对党的谴责，也受到阿登纳的基督教民主联盟内许多著名人士的反对。阿登纳大肆逮捕他党内的反对人士，接着又不顾党内的普遍不满和憎恶，强行通过自己留任总理的决定，这些都只能表明阿登纳地位的脆弱，只会使他陷入更加众叛亲离的地位。
    西方国家之间和各国内部目前这样分歧和混乱的根本原因是，这些国家里有一些政界人士看到，人民在强烈要求外长会议获得积极结果，违背人民的意志必将招致严重后果。有些人士也已经比较清醒地看到，西方今天在同苏联打交道时一点也不居于什么“实力地位”，西方愈拖延问题的解决，只会使它们自己愈被动，愈狼狈。现在，东西方外长即将开始第五周的会议，是西方外长们端正态度的时候了。
