Xinhua News Agency, June 23rd: General Xiao Hua, Deputy Director of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, gave a report on the visit of the Chinese Military Friendship Delegation to eight fraternal countries to more than 5,000 officers from various agencies and units stationed in Beijing on the afternoon of the 22nd.

General Xiao Hua first conveyed, on behalf of Marshal Peng Dehuai and all members of the Chinese Military Friendship Delegation, the deep friendship of the parties, governments, people, and armies of the eight fraternal countries of Poland, East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, Albania, and Mongolia to our Party, government, people, and army.

General Xiao Hua said that the Chinese Military Friendship Delegation, headed by Marshal Peng Dehuai, left Beijing on April 24th and began its visit to the eight fraternal countries. The visit lasted a total of 51 days, and they returned to Beijing on June 13th, successfully completing their mission. This visit helped to further enhance the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and helped to strengthen the struggle to defend peace. During the visit, we received a grand reception and warm welcome from the comrades of the parties, governments, and armies of the various countries. General Xiao Hua said that we also learned a lot during this visit. He cited many vivid and moving examples to illustrate the depth of the internationalist friendship of the fraternal countries. The armies of all fraternal countries have a high degree of vigilance against imperialist military aggression. The achievements of the economic construction of the fraternal countries, their concern for the material welfare of the people, and the continuous rise of the people's cultural and material living standards also gave us a deep impression.

Regarding military construction, General Xiao Hua said that all fraternal countries have established a people's army with modern equipment under the leadership of the Party. Military training, political education, and cultural life in the armies of all fraternal countries are very active, and the troops in some countries also participate in production labor. Some countries have also implemented a system of officers serving as soldiers on a regular basis. The troops are full of vigor and morale is high. The European fraternal countries are all members of the Warsaw Treaty Organization, and the cooperation between the armies is very good. If the aggressors dare to risk launching a new war of aggression, the armies and people of the fraternal countries, headed by the Soviet Union, will surely give them a devastating blow.

Finally, General Xiao Hua called on all comrades in the army to further enhance their internationalist consciousness, strive to enhance the fraternal friendship between the socialist camp countries headed by the Soviet Union, constantly learn from the advanced experiences of the fraternal countries, so as to strengthen our country's socialist construction and the construction of a modern revolutionary army, and always unite with the fraternal countries headed by the Soviet Union, help and support each other in defending peace and socialist construction, and advance shoulder to shoulder forever along the broad road of socialism.

    萧华报告我军事代表团访波德等国情况
    兄弟国家军队并肩保卫和平
    新华社23日讯　中国人民解放军总政治部副主任萧华上将，22日下午向驻京各机关、部队的五千多名军官，作了关于中国军事友好代表团访问八个兄弟国家的报告。
    萧华上将首先代表彭德怀元帅和中国军事友好代表团全体人员转达了波、德、捷、匈、保、罗、阿、蒙等八个兄弟国家的党、政府、人民和军队对我国党、政府、人民和军队的深情厚谊。
    萧华上将说，以彭德怀元帅为首的我国军事友好代表团于4月24日离北京，开始了对八个兄弟国家的访问，前后共五十一天，于6月13日回到北京，胜利地完成了访问的任务。这次访问有助于进一步增强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国的团结，有助于加强保卫和平的斗争。在访问中，我们受到了各国党、政府和军队同志的隆重接待和热烈欢迎。萧华上将说，在这次访问中我们还学到了不少东西。他举出许多生动感人的事例，说明兄弟国家的国际主义友谊的深厚。各兄弟国家军队对帝国主义的军事侵略有着高度的警惕。各兄弟国家经济建设的成就，对人民物质生活福利的关心，人民文化物质生活水平的不断高涨，也给了我们深刻的印象。
    关于军事建设，萧华上将说，各兄弟国家都建立了一支在党领导下的具有现代化装备的人民军队。各兄弟国家军队的军事训练、政治教育和文化生活都很活跃，有些国家的部队还参加了生产劳动。有的国家也实行了军官定期当兵的制度。部队朝气勃勃，士气旺盛。欧洲各兄弟国家都是华沙条约成员国，军队的协作很好。假如侵略者胆敢冒险发动新的侵略战争，以苏联为首的各兄弟国家的军队和人民，定将给以毁灭性的打击。
    萧华上将最后号召全军同志进一步提高国际主义的觉悟，努力增进以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国间的兄弟友谊，不断地学习各兄弟国家的先进经验，以加强我国社会主义建设和现代化革命军队的建设，同以苏联为首的各兄弟国家永远团结在一起，在保卫和平和社会主义建设中，互相帮助，互相支持，沿着社会主义的康庄大道永远并肩前进。
