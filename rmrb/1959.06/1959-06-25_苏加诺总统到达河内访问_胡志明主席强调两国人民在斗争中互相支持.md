Chairman Ho Chi Minh said that we will resolutely fight for the unification of the Vietnamese motherland, and at the same time will resolutely support the Indonesian people's struggle to recover West Irian.

The speeches of Chairman Ho Chi Minh and President Sukarno were constantly interrupted by warm applause.

After the welcoming ceremony, President Sukarno, accompanied by Chairman Ho Chi Minh, traveled in an open-top car to the Presidential Palace. He was warmly welcomed by 200,000 people lining the streets along the way.

Chairman Ho Chi Minh then paid a return visit to President Sukarno.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, June 24th: Chairman Ho Chi Minh hosted a state banquet at the Presidential Palace tonight in honor of Indonesian President Sukarno.

Chairman Ho Chi Minh said in his speech at the banquet: The two nations of Vietnam and Indonesia have a long history of relations. However, only after the people of both countries have shattered the shackles of slavery and the barriers built by imperialism have the two countries become closer and restored their inherent friendship.

Chairman Ho Chi Minh then sternly condemned the imperialist conspiracy to launch wars, create divisions, attempt to separate West Irian from Indonesia, and attempt to divide Vietnam. Chairman Ho Chi Minh said: "We once again solemnly declare that the Vietnamese people thoroughly support the Indonesian people in the struggle to liberate West Irian. We regard Indonesia's victory as our own victory. At the same time, we firmly believe that in our struggle to achieve national reunification, we will surely receive strong support from the Indonesian people."

Chairman Ho Chi Minh emphasized: "Imperialism must be eliminated, and we will surely achieve victory."

Next, President Sukarno delivered a speech at the banquet. He once again expressed his pleasure at being able to visit Vietnam. President Sukarno said that all countries and peoples can coexist peacefully. The two major blocs in the world can coexist peacefully.

President Sukarno said: He has seen colonialists and also those oppressed by colonialists. But there can be no peaceful coexistence between them. Where there are colonialists, where there is division, then there will be no peace. He said that we must oppose colonialism and strive for national unity.

President Sukarno expressed his belief that as long as they rely on the people, they can overthrow imperialism and colonialism. He said that if they rely on the strength of the masses, Indonesia's struggle for unification will surely achieve victory. He also expressed his belief that the Vietnamese people's struggle will also surely achieve victory.

    新华社河内24日电　胡志明主席今天晚上在主席府举行国宴招待印度尼西亚总统苏加诺。
    胡志明主席在宴会上致词说：越南和印度尼西亚两个民族有着悠久的历史关系。然而只有当两国人民已经粉碎了奴隶的枷锁和帝国主义所筑成的隔阂的壁垒之后，两国之间才接近起来和恢复了固有的友谊。
    胡志明主席接着严厉谴责帝国主义阴谋发动战争，制造分裂，企图使西伊里安脱离印度尼西亚和企图分裂越南。胡志明主席说：“我们再一次郑重声明，在解放西伊里安的斗争中，越南人民彻底支持印度尼西亚人民。我们把印度尼西亚的胜利看作是自己的胜利。同时，我们坚信，在我们争取祖国统一的斗争中，也一定会得到印度尼西亚人民的大力支持。”
