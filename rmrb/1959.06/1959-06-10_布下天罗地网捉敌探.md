Revolutionary Reminiscences:

    Laying a Net to Catch Enemy Spies
    Zhang Aiping
    Editor's Note: To commemorate "June 1st" Children's Day, the China Children's Publishing House invited Comrade Zhang Aiping, Deputy Chief of General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, to write stories about the revolutionary struggles of children during the Second Domestic Revolutionary War. We have selected two articles to be published in this newspaper successively.
    The enemy-versus-us struggle in the central red revolutionary base area was very arduous and complex. The heinous Kuomintang reactionaries frequently sent reactionary troops to carry out brutal encirclements and suppressions against the red areas, killing their way into the base areas, killing, burning, looting, raping and plundering everywhere, killing, beating, and dragging away adults and children alike; raping women of all ages, some of whom were beaten to death after being raped; implementing the "kill all, loot all, burn all" policy everywhere. From December 1930 to July 1931, Chiang Kai-shek mobilized 600,000 Kuomintang reactionary troops to launch three encirclements and suppressions: the first with 100,000 troops, the second with 200,000 troops, and the third with 300,000 troops. Chiang Kai-shek himself came out as the commander-in-chief, stationed in Nanchang, but all three encirclements and suppressions were defeated by our heroic and battle-tested Workers' and Peasants' Red Army and the Soviet area people under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao. In addition, the enemy also constantly sent spies and secret agents from outside to secretly infiltrate the base areas to carry out various sabotage activities and scout out military intelligence. At that time, the Young Pioneers and Children's Corps members actively participated in the red alert work in the base areas and launched a fierce struggle against the enemy's sabotage activities.
    They set up sentry posts on the hills, on the roofs, on the treetops... wherever they could see far, watching the white areas day and night, observing and monitoring the enemy's actions. These sentry posts all had pre-arranged contact signals with the villages: during the day, the enemy's presence was usually indicated by turning the red flag or straw man upside down; at night, it was usually by lighting a fire or beating gongs and drums. In this way, hill connected to hill, village connected to village, sentry posts were set up everywhere, in mutual contact.
    In the central areas, they also worked in pairs, standing guard at the traffic junctions around their villages and towns, checking the travel permits of passers-by, and sending those without travel permits or who were suspicious to the local revolutionary government or garrison for processing. These guards were armed with broadswords or spears.
    In this way, the children and teenagers everywhere monitored the enemy with their bright eyes, virtually weaving a dragnet across the base area.
    When the Kuomintang bandit army carried out "encirclement and suppression" campaigns against the red revolutionary base areas, they sent even more spies than usual to infiltrate the base areas to scout out military intelligence. Therefore, the work of the Children's Corps and the Young Pioneers in standing guard and checking passers-by became particularly intense.
    A moving story of a Children's Corps member risking his life to capture an enemy spy was circulating in the Children's Corps of the Jiangxi Red Revolutionary Base Area: In the summer of 1931, during the Third "Encirclement and Suppression" campaign by the Chiang bandit army, in a small border town—Futian, one evening, two Children's Corps sentries were hidden by the haystack along the road. One held a red-tasseled spear, and the other held a broadsword, vigilantly looking around.
    A stranger came from afar. Before entering the town, he looked around furtively, and then swaggered into the town.
    "Where are you from?" As soon as the man reached the edge of the town, the children's sentries flashed out from behind the haystack and shouted in unison. The sudden interrogation startled the stranger, but he paused for a moment and then replied with feigned composure:
    "From that village over there." He turned around and pointed to a village far away.
    "What's the name of the township Soviet chairman (note)?"
    "Who is the township Children's Corps leader?" Another child continued to ask, "Speak up! Speak up!"
    "The township Soviet chairman... uh, his surname is Su!" the stranger stammered. The two young sentries became even more suspicious.
    "Speak up! What's his name?" the young sentries asked sternly, as the two exchanged glances, and one sentry immediately ran towards the town.
    "His name is... Wei'ai."
    "Ha, ha, ha..." the young sentries laughed upon hearing this.
    Seeing that the situation was not good, the fellow looked around, pushed the young sentry, causing the young sentry to stagger backwards, and took the opportunity to turn around and run. Seeing that the situation was not good, the Children's Corps member shouted loudly, "The reactionary is running away! The reactionary is running away!" while desperately running after him. The stranger ran in a panic while constantly looking behind him. Somehow, he fell at the bottom of a slope. The young sentry took the opportunity to pounce on the fellow, and slashed at him with his knife, but the knife was blocked by the villain's hand and fell to the ground. The villain also took the opportunity to struggle desperately to escape, but one of his legs was tightly held by the young sentry. The young sentry shouted non-stop, "Come quickly!" while biting the villain's leg at random with his teeth. The villain also desperately beat him, and the two rolled into a ball at the bottom of the hillside. The villain suddenly picked up the young sentry's broadsword from the ground and slashed at him, cutting his left arm, and blood flowed freely. But the young sentry still clung to the villain's leg with all his might and continued to bite the villain's leg at random with his teeth. But the villain was strong, and the young sentry was already out of breath, so the villain dragged the young sentry along, and the young sentry continued to shout, "Catch the reactionary! Catch the reactionary!" As he was being dragged, the young sentry's right hand was cut again by the villain, and he fainted. The reactionary took the opportunity to run away with the knife. The other young sentry, leading more than ten Young Pioneers, arrived at this time. People from other villages also came upon hearing the shouts, surrounded the area, and caught the reactionary. It turned out to be a spy sent by Bai Fei Chiang Ting-wen's division.
    The glorious and wounded brave Children's Corps member was held by the Young Pioneer brothers, those bandaging the wound, those wiping the blood stains from his body, and everyone comforted him with admiration.
    "Was the reactionary caught?" the young sentry opened his eyes and asked anxiously with his first sentence. When he heard, "He was caught!" he was so happy that he struggled to stand up from the embrace and said stubbornly, "It's okay, I can walk myself!"
    "Truly worthy of being called a little hero!" the Young Pioneers and Children's Corps members praised in unison.
    "The reactionary was caught by all of you! How can I have caught him?" His humble attitude of not boasting at all made everyone admire him even more.
    The red teenagers and children were so brave, fearless, resourceful and flexible in fighting the reactionaries, defending the people's own red revolutionary base area!
    Note: "Su" is an abbreviation of Soviet. "Township Su" is what we call the township people's government, and the township head was called the chairman at that time.

    布下天罗地网捉敌探
    张爱萍
    编者按：为纪念“六一”儿童节，中国少年出版社请中国人民解放军副总参谋长张爱萍同志写了第二次国内革命战争时代少年儿童革命斗争的故事，我们选了两篇先后在本报发表。
    中央红色革命根据地的敌我斗争，是很艰苦复杂的，万恶的国民党反动派，经常派反动军队向红色区域进行残酷的围攻，杀到根据地里来，到处杀呀，烧呀，抢劫呀，奸淫掳掠，不管大人小孩，都要被杀的杀，打的打，拉走的拉走；不管老幼妇女，都遭奸淫，有的还在奸淫后被打死了；到处实行杀光、抢光、烧光的三光政策。从1930年12月到1931年7月，蒋介石就调动了国民党反动军队六十万人举行了三次围攻：第一次十万人；第二次二十万人；第三次三十万人，蒋介石亲自出马当总司令，驻镇南昌，但是，三次围攻都被我们英勇善战的工农红军和苏区人民在党和毛主席领导下打得落花流水。此外，敌人还经常不断的从外面派侦探、特务分子，秘密地潜入根据地，进行各种破坏活动、侦察军情。那时的少先队员、儿童团员们，都积极地参加根据地里的赤色戒严工作，展开反对敌人破坏活动的激烈斗争。
    他们在山岗上，在屋顶上，在树梢上……凡是能看得远的地方，都设上了望哨，两个人一对，不分日夜地向白区了望着，观察和监视敌人的行动。这些了望哨，同村庄里都规定有联络信号：白天发现敌人，通常是把红旗或草人倒下；夜间通常是燃起一堆火光或敲锣打鼓。这样，山岗连山岗，村庄接村庄，处处设了了望哨，互相联系。
    在中心地区，他们也是两个人一对，在本村、本镇周围的交通路口上站岗放哨，盘查来往行人的路条，发现没有路条或可疑的人，就押送当地革命政府或驻军处理。这些放哨人手里，都拿了大刀或梭标等武器。
    少年儿童们就是这样到处以雪亮的眼睛监视着敌人，简直把根据地布成天罗地网。
    国民党匪军对红色革命根据地举行“围剿”时，比平时派了更多的侦探混到根据地内侦察军情，因此，儿童团和少先队站岗放哨，盘查行人的工作也特别紧张起来了。
    在江西红色革命根据地的儿童团中传说着一件动人的儿童团员冒死捉敌探的英勇故事：1931年夏天，蒋匪军进行第三次“围剿”期间，在边区一个小镇——富田，有一天傍晚，路旁的草堆边隐蔽着两个儿童团的哨兵，他俩一个手持红缨枪——梭标，一个拿把大刀，机警地四面张望着。
    远远地来了一个陌生人，快进镇前，鬼头鬼脑，东张西望，然后就大摇大摆地走进镇子。
      “哪里来的？”那人刚到镇边，儿童哨从草堆后边闪出来，齐声喝问，这突如其来的盘问，使陌生人大吃一惊，但他怔了一下，又故做镇静地回答：
      “那面村子来的。”回头用手指着远远的一个村子。
      “乡苏主席（注）叫什么名字？”
      “乡儿童团长是哪个？”另一个儿童又接着追问：“快说！快说！”
      “乡苏主席吗，……嗯，姓苏！”陌生人支吾着。两个小哨兵更加怀疑了。
      “快说！叫什么名字？”小哨兵一面厉声追问着，两个人互相使了个眼色，一个哨兵立刻向镇里跑去了。
      “叫……维埃。”
      “哈，哈，哈……”小哨兵听着笑起来了。
    那家伙见势不妙，四下张望，用手推小哨兵一把，推的小哨兵向后踉跄几步，趁势向后拔脚就跑。儿童团员见势不妙，一面大声喊叫“反动派跑了！反动派跑了！”一面拼命地跑步追赶。陌生人一面慌里慌张地跑，一面不住地朝后面看，不知怎的，在一个下坡坎的地方跌倒了。小哨兵趁势扑到那家伙的身上，用刀就砍，可是刀被坏蛋用手一挡，落到地下了。坏蛋也趁势拼命地挣扎着逃跑，可是一条腿被小哨兵紧抱着不放。小哨兵一面不停地大喊：“快来人哪！”一面用牙乱咬坏蛋的腿，坏蛋也拼命地乱打，两人就在山坡下扭作一团。坏蛋突然从地上拿起小哨兵的大刀就砍，一刀劈在左胳膀，鲜血直流。但小哨兵仍然拼死紧抱着坏蛋的腿不放，仍然用牙乱咬坏蛋的腿。可是坏蛋的力大，而小哨兵已经累得气都接不上来，坏蛋就拖着小哨兵跑，小哨兵口里还是不断地喊“捉反动派啊！捉反动派！”拖着拖着，小哨兵的右手又被坏蛋砍了一刀，于是就昏倒了。反动派就趁机拿着刀跑了。另一个小哨兵领着十多个少先队员，正在此时赶到了，别的村庄的人听到喊声，也赶来了，四面一围，把反动派抓住了。原来是白匪蒋鼎文师派出的一个侦探。
    光荣负伤的勇敢的儿童团员，被少先队哥哥们抱着，包伤的包伤，揩干净身上的血迹，个个都以敬佩的心情慰问着。
    “反动派抓到了吗？”小哨兵睁开眼，第一句就关切地问道。当他听到“抓到了！”的时候，高兴得从怀抱里挣扎着站起来，倔强地说：“没有关系，我能够自己走的！”
    “真称得起小英雄！”少先队员及儿童团员们都同声地赞誉着。
    “反动派是你们大伙抓到的！那里是我捉到的呢？”他这种毫不自夸的谦虚态度，使大家更加敬佩他。
    红色的少年儿童们，就是这样英勇无畏，机智灵活地和反动派作斗争，保卫着人民自己的红色革命根据地！
    注：“苏”是苏维埃的简称。“乡苏”就是我们说的乡人民政府，那时把乡长称主席。
