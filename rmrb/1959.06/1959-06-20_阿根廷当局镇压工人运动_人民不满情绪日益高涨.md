    Xinhua News Agency, June 17th, Buenos Aires dispatch: The Argentine government arrested two generals on the 15th because they expressed dissatisfaction with the government's use of armed forces to suppress the workers' movement. The two officers were Raul Pohi, commander of the Third Army, and Florencio Yhonet, commander of the First Motorized Division.
    The report said that the above two senior military officers openly criticized the government's policy of brutally suppressing the workers' movement and demanded the resignation of Army Minister Solanas Pacheco and Army Deputy Minister Manuel Raimondes, who were subservient to the government.
    Since the Argentine government accepted a U.S. loan at the beginning of this year, the Argentine armed forces have been continuously used to suppress strike movements, attack marching crowds, and arrest trade union leaders. These repressive measures have aroused anger and dissatisfaction among the people across the country, and this dissatisfaction has recently spread to the armed forces.

    阿根廷当局镇压工人运动
    人民不满情绪日益高涨
    新华社17日讯　布宜诺斯艾利斯消息：阿根廷政府15日逮捕了两名将级军官，因为他们对政府使用武装部队来镇压工人运动表示不满。这两名军官是第三军军长劳尔·波希和第一摩托化师师长弗洛伦西奥·约内特。
    消息说，上述两名高级军官公开抨击了政府残暴镇压工人运动的政策，并要求对政府唯命是从的陆军部长索拉纳斯·帕切科和陆军部次长曼努埃尔·赖蒙德斯辞职。
    自从阿根廷政府在今年初接受美国贷款后，阿根廷武装部队就不断被用来镇压罢工运动、袭击游行队伍和逮捕工会领袖。这种镇压措施引起了全国人民的愤怒和不满，这种不满最近蔓延到武装部队。
