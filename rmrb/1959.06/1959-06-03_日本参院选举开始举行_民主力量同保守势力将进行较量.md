Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 2nd: The fifth postwar House of Councillors election in Japan began simultaneously across the country today. The outcome of this election will determine whether the Nobusuke Kishi government can obtain the necessary seats in the House of Councillors to revise the current constitution that prohibits Japan from waging war.

Voters began casting their ballots at more than 43,700 polling stations from 7:00 this morning. This election will re-elect 125 Councillors whose terms have expired, and also fill two vacancies. The Japanese House of Councillors has a total of 250 members, with a six-year term, and half of the members are re-elected every three years.

The Japanese public is closely concerned about the outcome of the struggle between democratic forces and conservative forces in this election. This is because the ruling Liberal Democratic Party originally held just over half of the seats. It attempts to seize more than two-thirds of the seats (167 seats) in the House of Councillors through this election in order to revise the current constitution that prohibits Japan from waging war and possessing war power. It also attempts to create more favorable conditions for approving the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," which pulls Japan into the U.S. atomic strategy system, so as to accelerate Japan's nuclear armament and further militarization.

The Japanese Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and other democratic forces resolutely oppose the conspiracies of the Nobusuke Kishi government and the Liberal Democratic Party. They have put forward election platforms and slogans with the central content of abolishing the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," restoring diplomatic relations between Japan and China, opposing nuclear armament, and safeguarding the constitution. The Communist Party and the Socialist Party have also conducted joint struggles in many prefectures to jointly strive for electoral victory.

The number of existing members and the number of members to be re-elected for each major party are as follows: Liberal Democratic Party, 127 members, including 66 to be re-elected; Japan Socialist Party, 78 members, including 31 to be re-elected; Ryokufukai (conservative party), 20 members, including 15 to be re-elected; Japanese Communist Party, 2 members, none to be re-elected.

According to Japanese radio broadcasts, the election results will be announced in batches. Twenty prefectures, including Aomori, Akita, and Gunma, are expected to count votes tonight; seven metropolitan prefectures, including Tokyo and Osaka, are expected to count votes on the evening of the 3rd; the final results of the election will be fully announced on the afternoon of the 4th.

    日本参院选举开始举行
    民主力量同保守势力将进行较量
    新华社2日讯　东京消息：日本战后第五次参议院选举今天在全国各地同时举行。这次选举结果将决定岸信介政府能否在参议院取得修改禁止日本作战的现行宪法的必要议席。
    选民们从今天早晨七点开始在四万三千七百多个投票所投票。这次选举将改选一百二十五名任期届满的参议员，另外还要补选两个空席。日本参议院共有二百五十名议员，任期六年，每三年轮流改选一半。
    日本公众密切关心着民主力量同保守势力在这次选举中的斗争结果。因为执政的自由民主党原来占有刚刚超过半数的议席。它企图通过这次选举在参议院攫取三分之二以上的议席（一百六十七席），来修改禁止日本作战和保有战争力量的现行宪法，并且企图为批准把日本拉入美国原子战略体系的新的日美“安全条约”创造更有利的条件，以便使日本加速核武装和进一步军国主义化。
    日本共产党、社会党和其他民主力量坚决反对岸信介政府和自由民主党的阴谋。他们提出了以废除日美“安全条约”、恢复日中邦交、反对实行核武装、维护宪法等中心内容的竞选纲领和口号。共产党和社会党并且在许多县里进行了联合斗争，共同争取选举胜利。
    各主要党派原有议员总数和改选议员数如下：自由民主党一百二十七名，其中改选六十六名；日本社会党七十八名，其中改选三十一名；绿风会（保守政党）二十名，其中改选十五名；日本共产党两名，全不改选。
    据日本电台广播，选举结果将分批揭晓。青森、秋田、群马等二十个县预计在今天夜里开票；东京、大阪等七个都府县预计在3日傍晚开票；选举的最后结果将在4日下午全部揭晓。
