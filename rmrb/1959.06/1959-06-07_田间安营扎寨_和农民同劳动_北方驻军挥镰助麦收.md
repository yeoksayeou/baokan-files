Xinhua News Agency, June 5th: As wheat gradually ripens in northern provinces, People's Liberation Army troops stationed in these areas are actively preparing to assist local farmers with the summer harvest. In regions where wheat has ripened early, stationed troops have mobilized to help with the harvest.

Officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Jinan helped four people's communes in the suburbs of the city harvest more than 2,000 mu of wheat on May 30th and June 1st. They worked cleanly and efficiently in bundling, binding, and transporting the wheat, leaving no grain behind. Commune members said: "Last year you helped plant the wheat, this spring you helped weed it, and now you've come to help harvest it. This year's bumper harvest is also thanks to your efforts!" A unit stationed in Zhengzhou received a weather forecast on May 29th warning of thunderstorms and immediately helped farmers rush to harvest, working hard for more than three hours to harvest more than 100 mu of wheat. The next day they harvested another 300 mu. An air force unit organized an "expedition team" of more than 800 people to set up camp in the areas where they were helping with the summer harvest, laboring and living alongside commune members; they also launched a "Five Goods" (good at labor, good at work, good at supporting the government and loving the people, good at protecting crops and public property, good at safety, good at health) assessment and competition.

At the same time, various technical arms and logistics departments have also sent a large number of vehicles to help communes that have started the summer harvest transport wheat. Some factories have also manufactured a batch of small harvesters for commune members to use during the wheat harvest. The Motor Vehicle Management School of a certain PLA unit stationed in Datong, in order to support agricultural production, has also trained a large number of automobile drivers for the suburban people's communes. Twenty-four of them have already graduated ahead of schedule and are投入working in the summer harvest transportation. The meteorological stations of all troops stationed in Shaanxi have been regularly reporting weather forecasts to the local summer harvest headquarters these days. When encountering wind and rain, they promptly send people to notify them, regardless of day or night. (Attached picture)

    田间安营扎寨　和农民同劳动
    北方驻军挥镰助麦收
    据新华社5日讯　随着北方各省小麦逐渐成熟，人民解放军驻北方各省的部队，积极准备帮助当地农民夏收。小麦成熟早的地区的驻军，纷纷出动，挥镰助民麦收。
    驻济南市的人民解放军官兵，在5月30日和6月1日，帮助市郊四个人民公社割麦两千多亩。他们在包割、包捆、包运当中，干得干净利落，颗粒不丢。社员们说：去年你们帮助种麦，今春帮助锄草，现在又来帮助收割，今年的大丰收，也有你们一分功劳呀。驻郑州的某部，上月29日接到有暴风雨的天气预报，立即帮助农民抢收，奋战三个多小时，收麦一百多亩，第二天又收了三百多亩。空军某部组织了八百多人的“远征队”，到帮助夏收的地区安营扎寨，与社员同劳动、同生活；并且开展了“五好”（劳动、工作好，拥政爱民好，爱护庄稼、公物好，安全好，身体好）的评比竞赛。
    在这同时，各技术兵种和后勤部门，也派出大批车辆帮助开始夏收的公社运输小麦，有些工厂还制造一批小型收割机，供社员在麦收中使用。解放军某部驻大同汽车管理学校，为了支援农业生产，还给郊区人民公社培养大批汽车司机，其中已有二十四名提前毕业，投入夏收的运输工作。驻陕西部队所有的气象台，这几天都定期向当地夏收指挥部报告天气预报，遇到风雨，他们不管白天黑夜，都及时地派人去通知。（附图片）
