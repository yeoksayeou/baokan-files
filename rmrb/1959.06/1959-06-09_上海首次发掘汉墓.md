    Shanghai's First Han Tomb Excavation

    Recently, the Shanghai Municipal Cultural Relics Preservation Committee's cultural relics survey team discovered a complete Han Dynasty tomb at Luotuo Mound in Chonggu People's Commune, 21 li northeast of Qingpu city. This is a "vertical pit" tomb, 2.8 meters long, 1.7 meters wide at one end, and 0.8 meters wide at the other. Although the deceased's skeleton and personal belongings have been reduced to ashes due to the passage of time, most of the 14 burial pottery pieces are still intact.

    Among the excavated pottery, there are pottery *fou*, gray pottery small jars, pottery *hu*, pottery *ding*, and pottery boxes. The pottery *fou* is particularly exquisite, with wave patterns on the body and vivid human-face shapes on the ears. Traces of millet-like plant seeds remain inside the *fou*. Other items, such as the pottery *hu* and pottery boxes, also have primitive glazes. This indicates that the people in the Shanghai area at that time had progressed from using primitive, rough pottery to using glazed primitive porcelain. These potteries have been tentatively identified as relics from the early to mid-Western Han Dynasty. The discovery of a Han tomb in the Shanghai area is the first time. It provides important physical evidence for the study of the history of the Shanghai area, the cultural influence and connections between the ancient north and south.

    上海首次发掘汉墓
    最近，上海市文物保管委员会的文物普查小组，在青浦城东北二十一里的重固人民公社骆驼墩发现了一座完整的汉代墓葬。这是一座“竖穴式”坟墓，长两点八公尺，一头宽一点七公尺，另一头宽零点八公尺。虽然因为年代久远，死者的骨架和随身衣物已经灰化无存；但陪葬的陶器十四件大多还完整无缺。
    在掘得的陶器中，有陶瓿、灰陶小罐、陶壶、陶鼎、陶盒等。其中陶瓿的制作十分精巧，瓿身有波浪纹，瓿耳有生动的人面形。瓿内还留存有粟类植物的种子痕迹。其他如陶壶、陶盒也都有原始的釉彩。这说明当时上海地区的人类，已由使用原始的粗糙陶器，进而使用有釉的原始瓷器了。这些陶器被初步考定为西汉初期至中期的遗物。汉墓在上海地区发现，这还是第一次。它对上海地区的历史和古代南北方之间的文化影响及联系的研究，提供了重要的实物资料。
