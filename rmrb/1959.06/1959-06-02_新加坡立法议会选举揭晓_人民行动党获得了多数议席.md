Xinhua News Agency, Singapore, May 31st: The results of the Singapore Legislative Assembly election have been announced today. The People's Action Party of Singapore has emerged victorious. In the election held on May 30th, the party secured forty-three of the fifty-one seats in the Legislative Assembly.

    The People's Alliance, led by the outgoing Chief Minister Lim Yew Hock, won four seats. The Singapore local organizations of the ruling party of the Federation of Malaya, the United Malays National Organisation and the Malayan Chinese Association, jointly won three seats. One seat was won by an independent.

    In the previous Legislative Assembly, the People's Action Party was the left-wing opposition party. The Liberal Socialist Party, the right-wing opposition party in the previous Legislative Assembly, did not win a single seat.

    The Communist Party, which was suppressed when the British colonial authorities promulgated the "Emergency Regulations" in 1948, was deprived of the right to participate in the election.

    According to the new Singapore Constitution promulgated by the British government in the name of the Queen last November, the party that wins this election will form the first government to achieve internal self-government, with a term of five years.

    The new Singapore Constitution is scheduled to come into effect on June 1st. This constitution stipulates that Singapore will become a country within the British Commonwealth that practices "internal self-government," while Britain will continue to control its foreign affairs and defense, and control its "internal security" affairs through an "Internal Security Council."

    新华社5月31日讯　新加坡消息：新加坡立法议会选举结果今天已经揭晓。新加坡人民行动党获得了胜利。在5月30日举行的选举中，这个党取得了立法议会五十一个议席中的四十三席。
    以卸任在即的首席部长林有福为首的人民联盟获得四席。马来亚联合邦执政党、马来民族联合机构和马华公会的新加坡地方组织一共获得了三席。还有一席为无党派人士所得。
    在上届立法议会中，人民行动党是左翼反对党。上届立法议会中的右翼反对党、自由社会党连一席也没有取得。
    在1948年英国殖民当局颁布“紧急条例”时遭到镇压的共产党，被剥夺了参加竞选的权利。
    根据英国政府在去年11月以女王名义颁布的新加坡新宪法，在这次选举获胜的政党将组织第一届实现内部自治的政府，任期五年。
    新加坡新宪法定在6月1日起实施。这部宪法规定，新加坡将成为英联邦内的一个实行“内部自治”的国家，而英国将继续控制它的外交和国防，通过一个“内部治安委员会”来控制它的“内部治安”事务。
