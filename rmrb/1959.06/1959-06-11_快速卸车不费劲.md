    Unloading is Quick and Effortless
    Jiao Yumin, an automotive transport worker at the Guang'anmen Railway Station in Beijing, created the "roller blind unloading method" for automotive transport of loose bulk cargo. The efficiency is more than 15 times higher than manual unloading, and more than 4 times higher than that of automobiles with automatic unloading devices.
    The method of roller blind unloading is as follows: First, spread a bamboo roller blind inside the truck bed, load the cargo on top, and leave one end of the bamboo blind with a steel wire rope outside. When unloading, drive an iron stake into the ground and hang the steel wire rope of the roller blind from the truck on the iron stake. As the truck moves forward, all the cargo on the truck can be rolled off.

    快速卸车不费劲
    北京广安门火车站汽车搬运工人焦玉民，创造了汽车搬运散堆装货物的“卷帘卸车法”。效果比人力卸车提高十五倍以上，比自动卸车装置的汽车效率提高四倍以上。
    卷帘卸车的作法是：先将竹卷帘铺在车箱内，上边装载货物，竹帘带钢丝绳的一端留在外边，卸车时在地面栽一铁钎，将车上卷帘的钢丝绳挂在铁钎子上，汽车往前开动，车上货物就可全部卷卸下来。
