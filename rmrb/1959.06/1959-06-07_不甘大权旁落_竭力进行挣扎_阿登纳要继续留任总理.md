Xinhua News Agency, Bonn, June 5th: West German Chancellor Adenauer formally stated on the evening of the 4th that he had decided to withdraw as a candidate for president and would continue to remain Chancellor. West Germany is scheduled to hold federal presidential elections starting on July 1st this year. The leading group of the Christian Democratic Union unanimously decided on April 7th to have Adenauer as the party's presidential candidate. Under pressure from everyone, Adenauer reluctantly agreed to this decision. In West Germany, the Chancellor decides the national policy, and the President is only a nominal position. Therefore, when the news came out, people believed that Adenauer would greatly lose the power he had long held alone.

However, developments quickly showed that Adenauer was still not prepared to give up the actual power to decide policy. He tried to find a basis in the West German "Constitution" to expand the powers of the President. However, this approach was strongly criticized by the opposition party. Then, Adenauer wanted to choose the current Minister of Finance, Etzel, as his successor as Chancellor in order to continue to implement his policy line.

Now, Adenauer's expression of his willingness to withdraw as a presidential candidate is obviously due to the fact that his proposal to make Etzel the Chancellor has failed to gain majority support within the parliamentary party.

The Christian Democratic Union Federal Parliamentary Party stated on the 5th that it "unanimously respects" Adenauer's decision to continue as Chancellor. However, the Speaker of the Federal Parliament and Vice Chairman of the Christian Democratic Union, Gerstenmaier, said in a statement that he regretted Adenauer's decision and believed that Adenauer's decision was essentially incorrect. Social Democratic Party Chairman Ollenhauer said in a statement that Adenauer's practice of abandoning the presidential election in order to continue as Federal Chancellor was "an irresponsible manipulation of the highest office of the Federal Republic and an example of unrestrained policy of personal influence."

### 不甘大权旁落　竭力进行挣扎  阿登纳要继续留任总理

    不甘大权旁落　竭力进行挣扎
    阿登纳要继续留任总理
    据新华社波恩5日电　西德总理阿登纳4日晚间正式表明，他决定放弃作总统候选人，而将继续留任总理。西德预定在今年7月1日开始举行联邦总统选举。基督教民主联盟领导集团曾经在4月7日一致决定要阿登纳作这个党的总统候选人。阿登纳在大家压力下，勉强同意了这个决定。在西德，决定国家方针的是总理，总统只不过是个有名无实的职位。因此，当这个消息传出后，人们认为阿登纳将大大丧失他长期来一人独揽的权力。
    但是，事态的发展很快表明，阿登纳仍然不准备放弃决定政策的实际权力。他曾设法从西德“宪法”中找到根据，来扩大总统的权力。但是，这个作法受到了反对党的猛烈抨击。于是，阿登纳又想挑选现任财政部长埃策尔为总理继承人，以便继续贯彻他的政策路线。
    现在，阿登纳表示要放弃作总统候选人，显然是由于他让埃策尔作总理的主张不能在议会党团内取得多数支持的原故。
    基督教民主联盟联邦议院党团5日声明，它“一致尊重”阿登纳继续作总理的决定。但是，联邦议院议长、基督教民主联盟副主席格斯登美尔在声明中说，他对阿登纳的决定很遗憾，他认为阿登纳的这个决定在实质上是不正确的。社会民主党主席奥伦豪尔在声明中说，阿登纳放弃竞选总统以便继续作联邦总理的作法“是对联邦共和国最高职务的一种不负责任的玩弄，并且是毫不遏制的个人势力政策的一个例证。”
