Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 5th - Prime Minister Castro condemned on the 4th the interference of the Organization of American States, under the control of the United States, in the internal affairs of Nicaragua.

Castro said at a meeting held yesterday by the Land Reform Commission that he "sympathizes with the Nicaraguan people's uprising against the Somoza dictatorship." He stated that Cuba's position would be very firm regarding any attempts by the Organization of American States to interfere in all internal affairs of Nicaragua. Castro pointed out, "Some people say that expeditions have left Cuba. This is a complete and utter lie. I don't have time to answer these things because I am busy with land reform."

According to "Revolución" newspaper, Cuban workers and students are supporting the armed struggle of the Nicaraguan people with practical actions. The National Union of Transport Workers announced that it will begin a broad mobilization today to raise funds for the Nicaraguan revolutionary cause. This union stated that the people of Latin America should fully unite in the struggle to control their own destiny. It also requested the Cuban Workers' Confederation to call on every Cuban worker to donate one peso to support the Nicaraguan people's struggle.

    新华社哈瓦那5日电　卡斯特罗总理4日谴责美国把持下的美洲国家组织对尼加拉瓜内政的干涉。
    卡斯特罗在土地改革委员会昨天举行的一次会议上说，他“同情尼加拉瓜人民反对索摩查独裁政权的起义”。他说，对于美洲国家组织干涉尼加拉瓜一切内政问题的任何企图古巴的立场将是十分坚定的。卡斯特罗指出，“有人说有远征队离开了古巴。这是彻头彻尾的谎言。我没有时间来回答这些事情，因为我在忙于土地改革。”
    据“革命报”报道，古巴的工人和学生正在以实际行动支持尼加拉瓜人民的武装斗争。全国运输工人工会宣布，从今天起开始进行广泛动员，为尼加拉瓜革命事业募集基金。这个工会说，拉丁美洲人民在争取掌握自己命运的斗争中应该充分地联合起来。它还要求古巴工人联合会号召每一个古巴工人捐献一个比索来支持尼加拉瓜人民的斗争。
