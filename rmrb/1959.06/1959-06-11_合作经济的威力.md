The old members of our cooperative always say: There is nothing wrong if we do what the Party tells us to do.

This is a creed that everyone in our cooperative has come to understand through five years of life.

After the Party issued instructions on the pilot agricultural cooperatives in 1954, twenty-two poor peasant households in our village immediately organized an agricultural cooperative.

During the difficult environment of the war, we realized through cooperative labor such as exchanging labor that only cooperative economy is the only correct path for peasants.

First of all, we were determined to transform the land, which had always been very barren, with the power of cooperation.

Whether it was paddy field or dry land, each cho (町步) (equivalent to 15 mu) could only harvest two to two and a half tons, and life was of course not prosperous. Land reform and the help of the people's government had not been able to completely eliminate the root of poverty in our village. The situation of the poor peasants whose lives had improved somewhat deteriorated again during the war, and the number of grain-deficient households reached 40%.

At this time, the former landlords and rich peasants took advantage of our weakness and tried to win over our agricultural cooperative members with a few liters of rice as bait. However, we overcame all difficulties, worked day and night, added 100 tons of topsoil to each cho of the ten cho of paddy fields, turning them into fertile fields, and achieved a high yield of four tons of rice per cho.

The fact that paddy fields that used to produce only two and a half tons per cho now yielded four tons moved the people in the village. Every poor peasant expressed their desire to join the agricultural cooperative.

The members of the neighboring Yifang Agricultural Cooperative said, what is the need for people living in the same village to divide a piece of land to plant? Why do brothers often quarrel over water? Therefore, in 1955, we merged the two agricultural cooperatives into one large cooperative, and accepted many poor peasant households into the cooperative, making our agricultural cooperative have 186 peasant households and more than 70 cho of paddy fields and more than 200 cho of dry land.

The poor peasants in our cooperative used to have to borrow food from the rich peasants every spring, but now they can save thirty bundles of grain and live a prosperous life. Seeing this situation, other villages also organized agricultural cooperatives one after another.

In addition to our Yuetao Agricultural Cooperative, villages such as Dade, Xiangxiao, and Caoshan also successively organized agricultural cooperatives. By 1955, 339 out of more than 460 peasant households in our li (乡) had joined the agricultural cooperatives.

In that year, our Yuetao Agricultural Cooperative improved the more than 70 cho of bad land brought by the new members, and established a water conservancy network in 17 cho of dry land. In this way, each cho of paddy field harvested 4.3 tons of rice. In that year, not one or two cho, but more than eighty cho of output doubled.

The members said that if the paddy fields of Yuetao, the pastures of Caoshan, and the orchards of Dade and Xiangxiao were merged and managed, we could live an unparalleled good life. In fact, the four agricultural cooperatives in the li (乡) each had superior conditions, but because they were managed separately, their superior conditions were not fully utilized. Yuetao had more land, but less labor; Caoshan had livestock land, but no funds; Dade and Xiangxiao had orchards, but no paddy fields and dry land. The members enthusiastically hoped to merge the four cooperatives to exert the power of large-scale cooperative economy.

Thanks to the direct understanding and correct leadership of the County Party Committee and the Party Central Committee, the four cooperatives merged into a large agricultural cooperative with 450 households in the spring of 1956. There were only ten individual households, including the former landlords, rich peasants, and orchard owners.

With the merger of the cooperatives, more than 130 cho of bad land were added. While managing a variety of economies, the agricultural cooperative carried out large-scale land improvement work, enabling 130 cho of paddy fields to achieve a high yield of 4.1 tons per cho on average.

The members not only received abundant grains, but also received a lot of cash. The ten households who remained outside the cooperative also felt that joining the cooperative would be beneficial to them. Therefore, our li (乡) realized full cooperativization by the end of 1956. Under the conditions of land improvement and the development of cooperative economy in many aspects, from 1957, our cooperative began to carry out the technical transformation and mechanization of agriculture.

In that year, we followed Comrade Kim Il Sung's instructions and transplanted rice seedlings cultivated by the "cold bed seedling method" on 90% of the area of all paddy fields; and planted cotton seedlings cultivated by the nutrient pot transplanting method in five cho of dry land.

From this year, we began to use tractors to plow all the paddy fields and dry land, and use animal-powered weeding machines in all paddy and dry land, realizing the mechanization of plowing and weeding, and the mechanization of threshing.

In this way, the yield of each cho of paddy field reached 4.5 tons. The cotton fields planted with nutrient pot seedlings yielded 1.5 tons per cho.

In that year, we also vigorously expanded animal husbandry, and began to raise 120 cattle, 130 pigs, 140 sheep, and many poultry, etc.

Last year, we carried out even greater technical innovations in agriculture than in 1957. We transplanted 100% cold bed seedlings in 137 cho of paddy fields, and planted 100% nutrient pot seedlings in 104 cho of cotton fields. In this year, the average yield of paddy fields reached five tons per cho, and the average yield of cotton reached 1.7 tons per cho. The rice yield was twice that of individual farming, and cotton was three times. Our lives have undergone tremendous changes.

In the past, we only had some wooden farm tools. Now, we have large machines such as tractors, trucks, seeders, electric threshers, weeding machines, rice milling machines, and many small farm tools, and almost all strenuous work has been mechanized. The total grain output has increased to 1.7 times that of five years ago, cotton has increased to eight times, and cattle and pigs have increased to 2.7 times and five times respectively.

People's living standards have also improved by leaps and bounds. In 1954, the Western and Yifang agricultural cooperatives, the average grain and cash distributed to each member household was 1.4 tons and 16,000 yuan (old currency) respectively, while in 1958, the distribution of grain and cash increased to 140% and 610% of 1954 respectively. In addition, calculated on the average number of households in the cooperative, each member household accumulated about 200,000 yuan (old currency) of public accumulation funds. The cooperative has also built welfare facilities such as bathhouses, barber shops, and many residences.

All these changes are very great. This would have been unimaginable in the case of individual peasant economy. Only the power of cooperative economy can create such achievements.

However, we are not satisfied with these achievements. We want to live a more fulfilling life. We believe that as long as we advance on the Chollima under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party, we will be able to achieve this goal in the near future.

This year, we will first respond to the resolution of the National Agricultural Cooperatives Conference, fully implement a high degree of collective farming, and strive to achieve a rice yield of more than ten tons per cho and cotton yield of more than three tons per cho in all paddy fields. We have already achieved certain achievements in fertilizer accumulation and cold bed seedling sowing.

Under the correct leadership of the Workers' Party, we will surely achieve greater victories this year.

    合作经济的威力
    朝鲜龙岗郡玉桃农业合作社社长  劳动英雄  林根三
    我们社的老社员们总是说：党叫做什么就做什么，这就没错。
    这是我们社每个人经过五年的生活所体会到的一个信条。
    党在1954年提出关于试办农业社的指示后，我们村庄的二十二户贫农立即组织了农业社。
    我们在战争时期的困难的环境中，通过换工等合作劳动认识到，只有合作经济才是农民的唯一正确道路。
    我们首先决心要以合作的力量改造一直是十分贫瘠的土地。
    不论水田、旱田，每町步（合十五市亩）只能收获二吨到二点五吨，生活当然是不能富裕的。土地改革和人民政权的帮助也没有能够完全消除我们村的贫困的根源。原来生活有些提高的贫农的景况在战争中又恶化了，缺粮户达到40％。
    这时，从前的地主和富农利用我们的弱点，用几升米作钓饵，企图拉拢我们的农业社员。但是，我们克服了一切困难，夜以继日地进行劳动，在十町步水田里每町步添上了一百吨客土，使它变成肥田，取得了每町步四吨水稻的高产。
    从前每町步只产二点五吨的水田现在收获四吨的事实，感动了村子里的人们。每个贫农都表示要参加农业社。
    邻近的义坊农业社的社员们说，住在一个村庄的人们有什么必要把一块土地分开来种呢？兄弟之间为什么时常因水吵架呢？因此，我们在1955年把两个农业社合并成一个大社，并接收了许多贫农户入社，使我们的农业社拥有一百八十六户农民和七十多町步水田、二百多町步旱田。
    我们社里的贫农从前一到春天就要向富农借口粮，现在都能够积下三十草袋粮食过富裕的生活了。别的村庄看到这种情况，也都纷纷组织农业社。
    除了我们玉桃农业社外，大德、乡校、草山等村庄也先后组织了农业社。到1955年，我们里内的四百六十多户农民已有三百三十九户参加了农业社。
    我们玉桃农业社在那年把新社员带来的七十多町步坏地改良了，并在十七町步旱田内建立了水利网。这样，每町步水田收获了四点三吨稻谷。那年，不是一两町步，而是八十多町步的产量都增加了一倍。
    社员们说，如果把玉桃的水田、草山的牧场、大德和乡校的果树合并起来经营，就可以过天下无比的好日子。事实上里（乡）内的四个农业社都各有优越条件，由于分别经营，它的优越条件没有充分发挥出来。玉桃土地多，劳动力却少；草山有畜牧地，却没有资金；大德和乡校虽有果园，却没有水田和旱田。社员们热烈地希望把四个社合并起来，发挥大规模合作经济的威力。
    由于郡党委员会和党中央委员会直接了解和正确的领导，这四个社在1956年春天合并成为一个拥有四百五十户的大农业社了。单干户只有以前的地主、富农和果园主等十户。
    随着并社，又增加了一百三十多町步的坏地。农业社在经营多种经济的同时，进行了大规模的土地改良工作，使一百三十町步水田平均每町步获得四点一吨的高产。
    社员们不仅分得丰富的谷物，也分得了很多现钱。留在社外的十户也觉得入社对他们有利了。于是，我们的里（乡）在1956年底全部实现了合作化。在土地改良和合作经济多方面发展起来的条件下，从1957年起，我们社就开始进行农业的技术改造和机械化。
    这一年，我们遵照金日成同志的指示，在全部水田的90％的面积上，插了用“冷床育苗法”育出的稻秧；并在五町步旱田里试种了用营养坛假植法育出的棉花苗。
    我们从这一年起开始用拖拉机翻耕所有的水田和旱田，在所有水、旱田里使用畜力除草机，实现了翻耕与锄草机械化和脱谷机械化。
    这样，水田每一町步的收成达到了四点五吨。种了用营养坛育苗的棉花田，每町步收成达到了一点五吨。
    这一年，我们还大力扩大畜产业，开始饲养一百二十头牛、一百三十口猪、一百四十只羊和许多家禽等。
    去年，我们在农业方面进行了比1957年还大的技术革新。我们在一百三十七町步水田里插了百分之百的冷床育苗，在一百零四町步棉花田里栽了百分之百的营养坛育苗。这一年，水田平均每町步产量达到了五吨，棉花平均每町步产量达到了一点七吨。水稻产量相当于单干时的两倍，棉花是三倍。我们的生活有了巨大的转变。
    过去，我们只有些木制农具。现在，有了拖拉机、载重汽车、播种机、电动脱谷机、锄草机、捣谷机等大型机械和许多小型农具，吃力的活几乎都机械化了。谷物总产量比五年以前增加到一点七倍，棉花增到八倍，牛和猪分别增加到二点七倍和五倍。
    人们的生活水平也有了飞跃的提高。在1954年，西部、义坊两个农业社，社员每户平均分得一点四吨谷物和一万六千元（旧币）现款，而1958年的谷物和现款分配量就分别增加到1954年的140％和610％。另外，按社内户数平均计算，社员每户约积累了二十万元（旧币）的公积金。社里还建成了洗澡堂、理发馆等福利设施和许多住宅。
    这一切变化是很大的。这在个体农民经济的情况下是做梦也想不到的。只有合作经济的威力，才能创造出这样的成绩。
    但是，我们并不满足于这些成绩。我们要过更加美满的生活。我们相信，只要在朝鲜劳动党的领导下，跨上千里马前进，不久的将来就可以达到这样的目的。
    今年，我们首先响应全国农业社大会的决议，全面实行高度的集体耕作，争取在全部水田里，使每町步水稻产量达到十吨以上，棉花达到三吨以上。我们已经在积肥和冷床苗播种工作中取得了一定的成就。
    我们在劳动党的正确领导下，今年一定能够取得更大的胜利。
