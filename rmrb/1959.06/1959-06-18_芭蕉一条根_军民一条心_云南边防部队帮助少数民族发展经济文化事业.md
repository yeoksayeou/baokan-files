　　Yunnan Border Troops Help Ethnic Minorities Develop Economic and Cultural Undertakings

　　(Our Dispatch) Reporter Su Hua reports: Border troops stationed on the Yunnan border have vigorously helped various fraternal ethnic groups develop their economies and cultural undertakings, achieving great success.

　　Over the past three years, officers and soldiers of the border troops have contributed 7.2 million workdays, helping the masses convert more than 60,000 mu of dry land into paddy fields and reclaim wasteland, and repair or participate in the construction of more than 3,700 water conservancy projects of all sizes, including canals, reservoirs, and ditches. Calculated at a yield of 150 jin per mu of dry land converted into paddy fields and reclaimed wasteland, this can increase grain production by 9 million jin per year, enough to feed 25,000 people for a year. They have also helped fraternal ethnic groups run nearly 700 schools and trained a large number of health workers.

　　In recent years, the troops have also sent more than 2,000 officers and soldiers to form an ethnic work team. They are scattered in border minority villages, living, eating, and working with the masses, helping them develop production and education and health undertakings. Banshi in the Ximeng area is a Kawa tribe with 415 households. Originally, the average grain output per person in the entire tribe was less than 200 jin. Many people only used a piece of tattered cloth or banana leaves to cover their lower bodies. This tribe is also located on the border, and the work foundation is very poor. Since the entry of the troop's ethnic work team in 1957, they first persuaded and led the masses to open three mu of paddy fields, which yielded 1,590 jin of grain in the same year, an increase of four times compared to previous years. In the second year, encouraged by the situation of the Great Leap Forward across the country, the enthusiasm of the masses became even greater. In this year, they opened another 125 mu of paddy fields and 35 mu of wasteland. The minority people also learned agricultural techniques such as accumulating fertilizer, plowing fields, and transplanting rice seedlings, and achieved a bumper harvest, with an average of 700 jin of grain per person. This year, they plan to open another 1,000 mu of paddy fields and plant crops such as wheat, cotton, and peanuts, striving to achieve an average of 1,400 jin of grain per person. The Kawa compatriots in this tribe sing: "The People's Liberation Army is truly capable, leading the Kawa people to turn themselves over, repairing rivers and canals, opening paddy fields, bringing river water to the mountains, turning barren slopes into terraced fields, sweet potatoes and Chinese cabbage grow vigorously, and there is more than enough rice to eat."

　　In the past, industry on the Yunnan border was almost a blank sheet of paper. Some places used very backward production tools. There was a village in the Kawa Mountains with only a small hoe weighing less than half a jin in the entire village. The 52 households in the Kucong Dazhuang in Jinping County, south of the Honghe River, had only a small knife that had become an iron sheet. For a long time, production could only remain in the primitive state of slash-and-burn cultivation. The troops stationed in these areas have been continuously improving and manufacturing new agricultural tools for the masses in recent years. According to the statistics of a certain unit in 1958 alone, 9,286 agricultural tools were improved, and 7,516 hoes, sickles, water pumps, and animal-powered vehicles were manufactured. Comrade He Quanming of a certain unit working in the Dulong area of the Wenshan Zhuang and Miao Autonomous Prefecture used his allowance to buy a set of woodworking tools and reference books, studied day and night, and finally made eight kinds of native machinery and tools such as grain threshers and potato cutters. After seeing these tools, the local Miao women said: "With these farm tools, our Miao people have turned over again."

　　The troops also helped the masses to vigorously develop cultural, educational, and health undertakings. Many schools were built with the help of the troops, who made teaching aids and sent teachers. Some were even established by soldiers donating money to buy textbooks. At most, these schools had more than 90,000 students. In teaching, they used methods such as "teaching with Pinyin characters" and "recognizing characters by seeing objects" when the troops were eliminating illiteracy, and achieved good results. After learning, the Yao compatriots in Miaoba, Wenshan Autonomous Prefecture, picked up their pens for the first time and wrote a letter to Chairman Mao, saying: "Such a thing is rare in a thousand years, it is difficult to learn culture in ten thousand years, we dig up the bitter roots to study and report, all thanks to Chairman Mao's leadership." In addition, in the past three years, the troops have treated 400,000 people of all ethnic groups. After prevention and treatment by the malaria prevention team of the troops, the epidemic of malaria has been basically controlled in many hyper-endemic malaria areas on the border.

　　The Lahu people on the Yunnan border have a folk song that expresses the gratitude of the fraternal ethnic groups to the People's Liberation Army for their help. The folk song sings: "The People's Liberation Army of Kawa and Lahu, is like one root for the banana tree, the Kawa and Lahu are the leaves, and the People's Liberation Army is the banana root."

    云南边防部队帮助少数民族发展经济文化事业
    本报讯　记者苏华报道：驻守云南边疆的边防部队，大力帮助各兄弟民族发展经济和文化事业，取得了很大成就。
    三年来，边防部队的官兵们，出工七百二十万个，帮助群众将旱地改水田和开荒地六万多亩，包修和参加修建的水渠、水库、水沟等大小水利工程三千七百多项。旱地改水田和开垦的荒地，按亩产一百五十斤计算，每年可以增加九百万斤粮食，够二万五千人吃一年。他们还帮助兄弟民族办了近七百所学校，训练了大批卫生工作人员。
    几年来，部队还派出了两千多名官兵，组成了一支民族工作队。他们散布在边沿少数民族村庄，和群众同吃同住同劳动，帮助他们发展生产和教育卫生事业。西盟地区的班师是个拥有四百一十五户人家的佧佤部落，原来全部落平均每人的粮食产量不到二百斤。很多人只用一块破布或芭蕉叶子遮着下身。这个部落又处在国境边沿，工作基础很差。自1957年部队的民族工作队进入后，首先说服和带领群众开了三亩水田，当年就收了一千五百九十斤谷子，比往年增产四倍。第二年在全国大跃进形势的鼓舞下，群众的干劲就更大了。这一年又开了一百二十五亩水田，三十五亩荒地，少数民族人民又学会了积肥、犁田、插秧等农业技术，获得了大丰收，每人平均收得了七百斤粮食。他们今年准备再开一千亩水田，种小麦、棉花、花生等农作物，争取每人平均达到一千四百斤粮食。这个部落的佧佤族同胞唱道：“解放大军真能干，领导佧佤把身翻，修河渠，开水田，河水引上山，荒坡变梯田，红薯白菜长得旺，大米吃不完。”
    云南边疆过去的工业几乎是一张白纸，有些地方用的生产工具非常落后，佧佤山有一个庄子，全庄只有一个不到半斤重的小镢头。红河南岸金平县的苦聪大庄五十二户人家只有一把已成了铁片的小刀。长时期来生产只能停留在刀耕火种的原始状态。驻在这些地方的部队，几年来不断为群众改良和制造新的农具。仅某部1958年的统计，就改良了农具九千二百八十六件，制造了锄头、镰刀、抽水机和人畜力车子七千五百一十六件。在文山僮族苗族自治州都龙地区工作的某部何权明同志，用自己的津贴买了一套木工工具和参考书，日夜钻研，终于制成了扇谷机、切薯机等八种土机械和工具。当地苗族妇女看到这些工具后说：“有了这些农具，我们苗家又翻了一次身。”
    部队还帮助群众大办文化教育卫生事业。许多学校都是部队帮助盖房子、做教具、派教员。有的还是战士们捐钱买课本开办起来的。这些学校人数最多时有九万多人。教学中他们运用了部队扫盲时“用拼音字教学”和“见物识字”等方法，都取得了很好的成绩。文山自治州庙坝的瑶族同胞学习后，第一次拿起笔来就是给毛主席写信，信中说：“千年难逢今日事，万年难逢学文化，挖了苦根读书报，全靠毛主席来领导。”此外，三年来部队为各族人民治病四十万人次。边疆许多超高度疟疾流行区，经过部队抗疟队的预防和治疗后，已经基本上控制了疟疾的流行。
    云南边疆拉祜族人民有一首民歌，唱出了兄弟民族感谢解放军对他们的帮助。民歌唱道：“佧佤拉祜解放军，就像芭蕉一条根，佧佤拉祜是叶子，解放军是芭蕉根。”
