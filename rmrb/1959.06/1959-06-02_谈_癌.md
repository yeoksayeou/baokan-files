Talk About "Cancer"
　　Fu Lianzhang

Rumors are often untrue; flies can also be transformed into elephants. Thanks to the advancement of medical science, diseases that were previously not well understood are now clearly understood. Furthermore, due to the continuous improvement of hygiene conditions and the reduction of infectious diseases and some common ailments, diseases that did not attract much attention in the past are now receiving more attention from people. Cancer has naturally become a disease of increasing concern. However, some people have an almost paranoid and fearful attitude toward cancer, which may be attributed to the spread of inaccurate rumors. In fact, cancer is not a disease of modern times; traces of it have been found in the skeletal fossils of primitive humans. Nor is cancer the most dangerous disease; certain acute infectious diseases pose a greater threat to human life than cancer. Cancer is also not the most frequently occurring disease; compared with the five major parasitic diseases and other common ailments, cancer is much less common.

However, since cancer is referred to as a malignant tumor, it indicates that it poses a significant threat to humans, so we must pay attention to it and not be "careless and underestimate the enemy."

Speaking of the harmfulness of cancer, we must first briefly explain the concept of tumors: As everyone knows, the manifestation of many diseases that damage the human body is often the deterioration and destruction of some cells, while a tumor is another type of disease, its manifestation being an unrestrained proliferation of a group of cells. Even when the patient's body is gradually wasting away, tumor cells continue to multiply. Therefore, from the perspective of metabolic physiochemical processes, tumor cells have essential differences from normal cells. Tumors are divided into two major categories: benign and malignant. Cancer is broadly used as a general term for malignant tumors, and narrowly refers to a class of malignant tumors originating from epithelial cells. Its malignant manifestations are mainly in the following three aspects: First, cancer grows rapidly, seizing the body's nutrients and bringing toxic effects to the body with some incompletely metabolized products, such as poor appetite, fatigue, and rapid weight loss. Second, the growth of cancer is highly destructive, causing the erosion of adjacent tissues. Third, during the growth process, a few cancer cells may rush into blood vessels or lymphatic vessels, flow with the blood and lymph, and be carried to other parts of the body, becoming a new starting point for growth. Once this phenomenon of migration and spread occurs, local surgery is difficult to be effective. In contrast, benign tumors grow slowly and do not undergo long-distance migration. Unless they occur in dangerous areas such as the heart and brain, they generally do not pose a very serious threat to health, but a few benign tumors may also become malignant, so early treatment is still necessary.

The reasons for the occurrence of cancer or tumors have not yet been fully answered. The known facts are that certain chronic stimuli may cause the occurrence of cancer, such as mechanical, thermal, radiation-induced physical stimuli, and the stimulation of coal tar and various chemical substances. Also, since several tumors growing on animals have been proven to be caused by viruses, the search for the biological pathogens of tumors has received widespread attention. However, all of these can only explain a part of the cases and do not have universal significance. Obviously, the body's internal conditions cannot be ignored in the occurrence of cancer. For example, after external stimuli are applied to the body, due to the different states of the human nervous system, especially the higher-level nervous function, some are sensitive, some are insensitive, some have strong resistance and adaptability to external damage, and some have weak resistance and adaptability to damage. These differences in reactivity have a certain impact on whether cancer occurs. Soviet scholars have long demonstrated through animal experiments that the disturbance of higher-level nervous activity can promote the occurrence and deterioration of cancer.

Although many theoretical issues concerning the occurrence of cancer have not been fully elucidated, we are not helpless in our fight against cancer. Recently, I visited the Beijing Tumor Hospital, and I was very pleased to see that it is a modern hospital. Here, many integrated traditional Chinese and Western medicine treatments are being carried out, as well as advanced radioactive isotope cobalt-60 treatment machines. These not only enable early-stage cancer to receive good treatment, but also allow relatively late-stage cancer to achieve considerable improvement.

To combat cancer, more effective means are to take preventive measures. Avoid certain physical and chemical injuries, such as X-ray workers being more prone to a type of skin cancer in the past, but now, with good protection methods, this phenomenon has almost disappeared. Secondly, since the early stage of cancer development is often quite lengthy, we should pay attention to the appearance of certain precursors. If there are long-term unhealed ulcers, suddenly rapidly growing moles, and excessive leucorrhea in older women, timely examination should be carried out to monitor the occurrence and development of cancer. In addition, physical exercise is also beneficial for cancer prevention, because most cancers are prone to occur in the elderly, and physical exercise can not only prevent premature aging, but also increase the body's resistance and adaptability to external damage.

Early detection, early diagnosis, and early treatment are universally recognized as the best methods to subdue cancer. Therefore, we should greatly promote tumor screening. Research has shown that cervical cancer can take as long as ten years from the earliest stage to the appearance of symptoms, and the earliest stage of cancer can be 100% cured. This fact powerfully illustrates the important significance of promoting tumor screening and early detection and early treatment. The Soviet Union has carried out a lot of work in cancer prevention and has achieved remarkable results. In our motherland, industrial hygiene conditions are improving day by day, medical facilities are also rapidly growing, and Chinese and Western medical personnel have also launched many aspects of cancer research. Since last year, major cities have also begun tumor screening work. Although this is only the beginning of the battle, we can firmly believe that under the leadership of the Party, through the joint efforts of medical personnel and the broad masses, the harm of cancer and all tumors will be gradually controlled, reduced, and ultimately eliminated.

    谈“癌”
    傅连暲
    传闻失实，苍蝇也可以变成大象。由于医学科学的昌明，从前认识不够清楚的病现在认识清楚了；又由于卫生条件的日益改善，传染病和某些常见疾病的减少，过去一些不太引人注意的病现在得到了人们更多的注意，这都是很自然的事。癌就是这样成为人们越来越关心的疾病了。但也有些人对于癌几乎存在一种草木皆兵谈虎色变的心理，这可能要归咎于传闻失实的错误。其实，癌并不是近代才有的病，在原始人的骨胳化石中就发现过它的痕迹。癌也不是最危险的病，某些急性传染病对人生命的威胁比癌还要大。癌更不是发生最多的病，如果与五大寄生虫病和其它常见疾病相比较，癌就要少得多了。
    但是癌既被称为恶性肿瘤，就说明它对于人的危害也不小，所以还得重视它而不能“麻痹轻敌”。
    谈到癌的危害性，先得简单地说明一下肿瘤的概念：大家都知道，有许多疾病损害人体的表现常是一部分细胞的变质和毁灭，而肿瘤则是另一种病，它的表现是一群细胞的不可遏止的新生；即使在患者身体逐渐消瘦的状况下，肿瘤细胞仍然不断的繁殖，所以从新陈代谢的理化过程上看，肿瘤细胞与正常细胞有着本质的差异。肿瘤分良性恶性两大类，癌在广义上被用作恶性肿瘤的通称，狭义的是指恶性肿瘤中发生自上皮细胞的一类。它的恶性表现主要在以下三个方面：第一、癌生长迅速，夺取身体的营养，又把一些代谢不完全的产物，给身体带来了中毒性的影响，如发生食欲不好，精力疲惫，和很快的消瘦。第二、癌的生长有很大的破坏性，使相邻的组织遭到侵蚀。第三、在生长过程中，少数癌细胞可能冲到血管或淋巴管内，随着血液和淋巴液流动，被带至身体其他部位，又成为一个新的生长起点。这种迁徙播散的现象一经发生，局部的手术就很难奏效。与此相反，良性肿瘤生长缓慢，也不发生远距离的迁徙，只要不是发生在心脑等险要部位，一般对健康的威胁并不十分严重，但少数良性肿瘤也可能恶化，因而及早治疗还是必要的。
    癌或者肿瘤发生的原因，目前还没有完满的答案。已经知道的事实是某些慢性刺激可能引起癌的发生，如机械的、灼热的、放射线的物理性刺激，煤焦油和多种化学物质的刺激等。又由于几种生长在动物身上的肿瘤证明是病毒引起的，寻找瘤的生物性病原又得到了广泛的注意。但所有这些，都只能说明一部分事例，还没有普遍性的意义。显然，癌的发生，身体内在条件也是不容忽视的，如像外界刺激加于身体以后，因为人的神经系统特别是高级神经功能状态的不同，有的敏感，有的迟钝，有的对于外界损害的抵抗和适应能力强，有的对于损害的抵抗和适应能力弱。这些反应性的差别，对于癌的是否发生，有一定的影响。苏联学者很早就通过动物实验证明了高级神经活动的扰乱，能助长癌的发生和恶化。
    发生癌的许多理论问题，虽然没有完全破晓，但我们与癌的斗争并不是束手无策的。最近我参观了一次北京肿瘤医院，使我非常高兴的看到这是一所现代化的医院。在这里开展着许多中西医的综合性治疗，还有先进的放射性同位素钴60的治疗机。这些不仅能使早期的癌能得到好的治疗，就是比较晚期的也能获得相当的改善。
    我们与癌作斗争，更有效的手段是采取预防措施。避免某些物理化学的伤害，如爱克斯射线工作者从前比较容易患一种皮肤癌，现在因为有了很好的防护方法，这种现象几乎绝迹了。其次，由于发生癌的前期过程往往是相当漫长的，所以要注意某些预兆的出现。如有长期不愈的溃疡，突然长快的黑痣，和年龄较大的妇女出现白带过多等等，都要及时检查，监视癌的发生和发展。此外，锻炼身体对防癌也有好处，因为多数的癌易发生于老年，而锻炼身体既能防止早衰，又可以增加身体对于外界损害的抵抗和适应能力。
    早期发现，早期诊断，早期治疗，被公认为是制伏癌的最好方法。因此应该大大提倡肿瘤的普查工作。有人研究证明，子宫颈癌从最早期到有症状的出现，可以经过十年之久，而最早期的癌能够100％的治愈。这一事实有力地说明了推行肿瘤普查。早期发现早期治疗的重要意义。苏联在防癌方面进行了许多工作，并已经取得了显著的成效。在我们祖国，工业卫生状况已日益改善，医疗设施也在迅速增长，中西医药人员也开展了多方面的有关癌的研究。去年以来，各大城市又开始了肿瘤的普查工作，虽然这还只是战斗的开端，但我们可以深信在党的领导下，通过医务人员与广大群众的共同努力，癌和一切肿瘤的危害将逐步的被控制、减少，而最终消灭。
