Xinhua News Agency, June 1st: The Second Art and Literary Performance Conference of the Chinese People's Liberation Army grandly opened at the Beijing Gymnasium tonight. This is the largest art and literature review since the founding of the People's Liberation Army. It will review the achievements of the entire army in resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's literary and artistic thought, serving the company-level units, serving the soldiers, and comprehensively developing combative and mass-based cultural and artistic work, and further promote the army's art and literature work to continue to improve on the basis of popularization.

Luo Ronghuan, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Li Fuchun, Vice Premier of the State Council, Xie Juezai, President of the Supreme People's Court, Zhang Dingcheng, Procurator-General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, Zhang Zhizhong, Vice Chairman of the National Defense Council, General Chen Geng, Deputy Chief of General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and General Tan Zheng, Director of the General Political Department, attended the opening ceremony tonight.

Also attending the opening ceremony were Zhou Yang, Cai Chang, Qian Junrui, Ding Xilin, Tian Han, Ouyang Yuqian, Yang Hansheng, Cai Chusheng, Shao Quanlin, Ma Sicong, Wu Xiaobang, Cai Ruohong, Xiao San, Zhou Weizhi, Ge Baoquan, Situ Huimin, and other famous figures from the capital's various circles and literary and art circles.

Military attachés from various countries stationed in China, art workers and experts from fraternal countries such as the Soviet Union in Beijing were also invited to attend the opening ceremony.

Also participating in the opening ceremony were leaders of various art and literary delegations and various agencies and organizations in the capital, senior generals of the People's Liberation Army's Army, Navy, and Air Force and representatives of the broad masses of officers and soldiers, as well as representatives of various cultural agencies and art and literary organizations in the capital, totaling more than six thousand people.

Lieutenant General Liu Zhijian, Deputy Director of the General Political Department, spoke amidst warm applause. He first, on behalf of the General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army, extended a warm welcome and congratulations to all members of the art and literary delegations from all units of the army. He said that in recent years, the army's art and literature work has made great progress and improvements, both in professional art and literature work and in mass amateur activities, in accordance with the requirements of the new situation. In particular, after the great rectification movement and the anti-rightist struggle in 1957, the bourgeois literary and artistic thought was criticized, and the army's art and literature workers were tested in this struggle. The direction of art and literature serving proletarian politics and serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, and the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" formulated by the Party and Chairman Mao were implemented. The fine traditions of army art and literature work facing the company-level units, serving the soldiers, and being combative and mass-based were carried forward.

Lieutenant General Liu Zhijian pointed out that since 1958, the army's art and literature workers have enthusiastically responded to the call of the General Political Department, gone down to the companies as soldiers, gone up to the mountains and down to the countryside, and plunged into the upsurge of the Great Leap Forward. In actual practice, they have improved their thinking, improved their work style, strengthened their ties with the masses, enriched the source of literary and artistic creation, and guided the masses' amateur art and literature activities, thereby greatly changing the ideological outlook of the army's professional art and literature teams. Mass amateur art and literature activities have also ushered in an unprecedentedly active new situation, and many excellent art and literature creations and actors have emerged, greatly enlivening the army's life and playing a great role in inspiring fighting spirit and promoting the Great Leap Forward in the army's work.

Lieutenant General Liu Zhijian said that the purpose of this performance conference is to summarize and exchange experiences in art and literature work through the performance, to achieve mutual learning and common improvement, and to enable the army's art and literature work to achieve new development and improvement. He called on the army's art and literature workers to continue to work and study diligently and conscientiously, to strive to improve their political awareness, strengthen practical training, improve artistic skills, and enrich cultural and artistic accomplishment. The army's art and literature work must conscientiously implement the direction of art and literature serving proletarian politics and serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, and the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend"; follow the work methods of combining the improvement of ideological level and the improvement of artistic level, combining popularization and improvement, and combining professional art and literature work and mass amateur art and literature activities, and raise the cultural and artistic work of our army one step further on the existing basis.

After Lieutenant General Liu Zhijian's speech, a wonderful art and literature performance began. The "Generals Choir" of the General Headquarters directly under the People's Liberation Army, conducted by General Li Zhimin, sang loudly "The Red Army Discipline Song," "On the Taihang Mountains," and "I Am a Soldier." When they finished singing the scheduled program, the audience repeatedly requested the generals to sing another song, "We Must Plant the Victory Flag on Taiwan."

Also participating in tonight's art and literature performance were the Air Force Amateur Performance Team's dance "People's Commune Flowers Bloom," the Navy Amateur Performance Team's dance "Battle Song" depicting the Fujian Front Line severely punishing the Kinmen Chiang troops, the General Political Department Art Troupe's orchestral music "Million雄师下江南 (Million Soldiers Cross the Yangtze)," and the Front Line Song and Dance Troupe's "Zhoushan Gongs and Drums," and more than ten other wonderful programs. The teachers and students of the General Political Department's Officers' Children's School - "Eleventh" Primary School also performed a "Great Teachers and Students Joint Singing" for the conference.

    据新华社1日讯　中国人民解放军第二届文艺会演大会今晚在北京体育馆隆重开幕。这是人民解放军建军以来规模最大的一次文艺大检阅，它将检阅全军坚决贯彻毛主席文艺思想，面向连队、为兵服务和全面发展战斗性、群众性文化艺术工作的成就，进一步推动全军文艺工作在普及的基础上继续提高。

    总政治部副主任刘志坚中将在热烈的掌声中讲话。他首先代表人民解放军总政治部向来自全军各部队的文艺代表队全体人员，表示热烈的欢迎和祝贺。他说，几年来，部队文艺工作根据新形势的要求，无论在专业文艺工作和群众性业余活动方面，都有了很大的发展和提高。特别是经过1957年伟大的整风运动和反右派斗争，批判了资产阶级文艺思想，部队的文艺工作者在这一场斗争中，经受了考验，党和毛主席制定的文艺为无产阶级政治服务、为工农兵服务的方向，和“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针得到了贯彻，部队文艺工作面向连队、为兵服务和战斗性、群众性的优良传统，得到了发扬。
    刘志坚中将指出，1958年以来，全军文艺工作者热烈响应总政治部的号召，纷纷下连当兵、上山下乡，投身到大跃进的浪潮中去，在实际锻炼中提高了思想，改进了作风，密切了和群众的联系，丰富了文艺创作的源泉，辅导了群众业余文艺活动，从而大大改变了部队专业文艺队伍的思想面貌。群众性的业余文艺活动，也出现了空前活跃的新局面，并出现了许多优秀的文艺创作和演员，大大活跃了部队生活，对鼓舞斗志、推动部队工作的大跃进也起了很大的作用。
    刘志坚中将说，这次会演的目的，就是要通过会演，总结和交流文艺工作的经验，达到互相学习、共同提高，使部队文艺工作得到新的发展与提高。他号召全军文艺工作者，继续兢兢业业、勤勤恳恳地工作与学习，努力地提高政治觉悟、加强实际锻炼和提高艺术技巧、丰富文化艺术修养。部队的文艺工作必须认真地贯彻执行文艺为无产阶级政治服务、为工农兵服务的方向和“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针；遵循着提高思想水平和提高艺术水平相结合，普及和提高相结合，专业文艺工作和群众业余文艺活动相结合等两条腿走路的工作方法，把我军的文化艺术工作在现有的基础上再提高一步。
    刘志坚中将讲话后，开始了精采的文艺表演。人民解放军总直属队“将军合唱团”在李志民上将的指挥下，引吭高歌“红军纪律歌”、“在太行山上”和“我是一个兵”。当他们唱完预定的节目时，全场观众再三要求将军们又唱了一支“一定要把胜利的旗帜插到台湾”。
