Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, June 12th - The Ministry of Construction Engineering and the Architectural Society of China recently jointly held a "Symposium on Residential Building Standards and Architectural Art" in Shanghai. The symposium broadly discussed the following question: how to build residential and other buildings as aesthetically pleasing and artistically advanced as possible, based on the principle of "applicable, economical, and aesthetically pleasing where possible."

Liu Xiufeng, Minister of Construction Engineering, called on architects at the symposium to earnestly follow the mass line, foster the spirit of collective creation, launch a hundred schools of thought in academic circles, and allow a hundred flowers to bloom in creation, so as to actively improve the level of architectural art and create a new style of Chinese socialist architecture.

The symposium pointed out that the Party and the government have consistently attached importance to improving people's living conditions. Over the past ten years, a large number of new residences have been built across the country. In Shanghai alone, the area of newly built workers' housing has exceeded four million square meters, and eighteen workers' new villages, such as Caoyang, Fengcheng, Tianmu, and Tianshan, have been built, enabling hundreds of thousands of workers and their families to move from damp and dark shantytowns or lanes into new homes with ample sunlight and modern sanitary facilities. However, in grasping residential building standards, there have been instances of being either too high or too low; at the same time, some residential buildings have neglected aesthetics where possible, thus appearing relatively rigid and monotonous.

At the symposium, everyone cited many ways to utilize terrain or local materials, without spending much money, but still making residential buildings applicable and beautiful. For example, Chongqing is a hilly area, hot in summer, and often swept by northerly winds. Therefore, some people advocate that residential buildings should mainly face north-south so that residents can take advantage of the through-draft from the north, and at the same time, can combine with the undulating terrain to arrange various architectural forms, creating a beautiful mountain city landscape.

The symposium spent more time discussing architectural art issues. Since liberation, under the leadership of the Party, architectural design workers have improved their political thinking, architectural technology, and artistic level. In industrial, water conservancy, and civil architecture, some buildings have emerged that are praised by everyone. Some of these buildings have broken away from the old conventions in individual design and have a unique style; others have been properly handled with the surrounding environment, giving people a sense of overall beauty. Everyone at the symposium unanimously agreed that today is the golden age for architects to exert their creativity. With the progress of socialist construction, not only will industrial and water conservancy projects become more magnificent, and the face of nature will be transformed more beautifully; but also, people's lives will become richer and more colorful. More buildings and construction projects that people have not seen or thought of in the past will emerge, all of which require architects to carefully design and boldly create. Everyone believes that to achieve this, we must first liberate our minds and create new architectural forms consistent with the content, according to different natural conditions, different living habits, different national preferences, and different usage requirements. Everyone also discussed the relationship between applicability, economy, and aesthetics in architectural design.

    适用、经济、在可能条件下注意美观
    创造社会主义的建筑新风格
    建筑设计单位座谈提高建筑艺术水平
    新华社上海12日电　建筑工程部和中国建筑学会最近在上海联合召开“住宅建筑标准及建筑艺术座谈会”，广泛地讨论了下面的问题：如何根据“适用、经济、在可能条件下注意美观”的原则，把住宅及其他建筑物尽可能地建筑得更美观些，艺术水平更高些。
    建筑工程部部长刘秀峰在座谈会上号召建筑师们认真走群众路线，发挥集体创作精神，在学术上展开百家争鸣，创作上做到百花齐放；积极提高建筑艺术水平，创造出中国的社会主义的建筑新风格。
    座谈会上指出，党和政府一贯重视改善人民居住条件，十年来全国各地建筑了大批新住宅。以上海一地来说，十年来新建的工人住宅面积已超过四百万平方公尺，建成了曹杨、凤城、天目、天山等十八个工人新村，数十万工人和家属从潮湿阴暗的棚户或里弄里搬进了阳光充足、有现代化卫生设备的新居。但是在掌握住宅建筑标准问题上，也曾出现过偏高偏低的现象；同时，有些住宅建筑忽视了在可能条件下的美观，因此显得比较呆板、单调。
    座谈会上，大家举出了许多利用地形或当地材料，不多花钱但又可以把住宅建筑得适用、美观的办法。例如重庆地区丘陵起伏，夏季炎热，多吹北风，因此有人主张住宅建筑应以南北向为主，以便居民能够利用北边来的穿堂风，同时可以结合参差起伏的地形，布置多种多样的建筑形式，构成美丽的山城景色。
    座谈会以较多的时间讨论了建筑艺术问题。解放以来，建筑设计工作者在党的领导下，政治思想、建筑技术和艺术水平都有所提高，在工业、水利和民用建筑方面，出现了一些为大家所赞许的建筑物。这些建筑物，有的在个体设计上摆脱了老一套，具有独特的风格；有的和周围环境处理得当，使人对之有整体美的感受。座谈会上大家一致认为，今天正是建筑师们发挥创造性的黄金时代。随着社会主义建设的进展，不仅工业和水利方面的工程越来越宏伟，大自然的面貌改造得越来越美丽；而且，人民的生活也越来越丰富多采，过去人们没有见到或想到的建筑物和建筑工程会更多地出现，都有待建筑师们去精心设计，大胆创造。大家认为，要达到这一点，首先要解放思想，根据不同的自然条件、不同的生活习惯、不同的民族爱好和不同的使用要求，创造出各种同内容相一致的建筑新形式。大家还就建筑设计上的适用、经济、美观三者之间的关系等问题，进行了讨论。
