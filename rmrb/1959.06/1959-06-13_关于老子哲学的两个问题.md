Continuing from previous edition

Now, let's discuss the second question.

As mentioned above, the schools of thought in pre-Qin philosophy, using terms like Confucianism and Taoism, follow the division of pre-Qin schools into six or ten categories since Liu Xin of the Han Dynasty. This classification has some factual basis but is not entirely scientific. Within many schools, there is a struggle between idealism and materialism. Within Confucianism, Mencius is the representative of idealism, and Xunzi is the representative of materialism. This is now generally accepted. Within the scope of Taoism, regarding the four schools mentioned in the "Tianxia" chapter, the Peng Meng, Tian Pian, and Shen Dao school can be temporarily disregarded due to insufficient material. As for the remaining three schools: The Song Yin school is now generally considered to be idealistic. I also belong to this majority. However, opinions diverge regarding the Lao Dan school. Some people believe that the philosophical thought in the Book of Lao Tzu is fundamentally idealistic. This group is referred to as Group A below; others believe that the philosophical thought in the Book of Lao Tzu is fundamentally materialistic. This group is referred to as Group B below, and I belong to Group B. As an aside, a report in the Guangming Daily a month ago stated that during a discussion of Lao Tzu in the Chinese Philosophy History Teaching and Research Section of Peking University, I advocated that the philosophical thought in the Book of Lao Tzu was idealistic, but I later abandoned this view. This report is inaccurate. Before liberation, I did not consider whether the philosophical thought in the Book of Lao Tzu was materialistic or idealistic. After liberation, I have always believed it to be materialistic. Another point to mention is that Group A and Group B for the second question are not consistent with Group A and Group B for the first question. Some people belong to Group A for the first question and Group B for the second question, and vice versa.

First, it should be clarified that most people in Group A now also acknowledge that the philosophical thought in the Book of Lao Tzu has materialistic elements, even a significant amount of materialistic elements. Most people in Group B also acknowledge that the philosophical thought in the Book of Lao Tzu has idealistic elements, even a significant amount of idealistic elements. There is little debate between the two sides on this point. The focus of the debate between the two sides is: Is the philosophical thought in the Book of Lao Tzu fundamentally materialistic or idealistic? That is, in the philosophical thought of the Book of Lao Tzu, which occupies the dominant position, materialism or idealism? Regarding this central issue, both Group A and Group B have made many arguments and presented their respective arguments, but until now, neither side has convinced the other, resulting in a stalemate.

One reason for this situation is, of course, that the Book of Lao Tzu is "concise in writing and rich in meaning." Many important sentences can have different interpretations and different punctuations. For example, people in Group B believe that the so-called "being" and "non-being" in the Book of Lao Tzu are abbreviations for "named" and "unnamed." Take the first chapter, "Unnamed, the beginning of heaven and earth; named, the mother of all things," as an example. Group A says: That's not right. Your reading is wrong. It should be read as: "Non-being, names the beginning of heaven and earth; being, names the mother of all things." Group A believes that the Tao is the unity of constant non-being and constant being, and that constant non-being is the fundamental aspect. Take the first chapter, "Constantly without desire, to observe its wonders; constantly with desire, to observe its boundaries," as an example. Group B says: That's not right. Your reading is wrong. It should be read as "Constantly without desire, to observe its wonders; constantly with desire, to observe its boundaries." The person who wrote the Book of Lao Tzu originally did not use punctuation marks. How should these sentences be read? There is no definitive answer. These kinds of debates can continue, but they don't lead to any conclusions.

I raise this example to illustrate that some debates about Lao Tzu are like both sides attacking each other, each sticking to their own words, and focusing their efforts on these aspects, which cannot solve the problem. To solve the problem, we must first consider the method of discussion. In terms of the method of discussion, I think we should pay attention to two points.

The first point is not to modernize Lao Tzu's philosophy. As I said above, the philosophical system expounded in the Book of Lao Tzu is quite complete. This is according to the standards of the pre-Qin period. According to the standards of modern philosophy, it should be admitted that ancient philosophical thoughts were simple, naive, and far less complex and detailed than modern philosophical thoughts. Judging from the current debate on Lao Tzu's philosophy, both Group A and Group B tend to modernize the philosophical thought expounded in the Book of Lao Tzu. When Group A talks about it, they often talk about the Tao in the Book of Lao Tzu as something similar to Hegel's absolute idea. As a result, the characteristics of Hegel's absolute idea, such as absolute, timeless and spaceless, are all placed on the Tao. I feel that pre-Qin philosophers would not have such ideas, because their thoughts would not be so meticulous. When Group B talks about it, they often say that the Tao in the Book of Lao Tzu is a "material entity." As a result, they believe that the Tao in the Book of Lao Tzu is really like matter as described by modern materialism, without any mysterious elements; this is obviously not right either. In ancient philosophy, there was no extremely pure concept of matter. Even later materialistic philosophers, such as Zhang Zai and Wang Fuzhi, their so-called "qi" cannot be said not to be matter, but it also has mysterious elements in it. Therefore, the idealism of the Book of Lao Tzu as described by Group A is somewhat exaggerated. The materialism of the Book of Lao Tzu as described by Group B is also somewhat exaggerated. Part of the debate between Group A and Group B arises from these exaggerations.

The Book of Lao Tzu says: "There is something formed out of chaos, born before heaven and earth" (Chapter 25), and also says: "As a thing, the Tao is elusive and vague" (Chapter 21). The word "thing" in these two sentences can be interpreted as "a general thing." In these sentences, the Book of Lao Tzu is only saying: There is such a thing formed out of chaos that existed before heaven and earth; that thing called Tao is vague. Although the Book of Lao Tzu uses the word "thing" in these sentences, it does not explain whether the Tao is a spiritual or material thing. This is acknowledged by both Group A and Group B. However, Group B believes that the words "formed out of chaos" can only be used as an adjective for a material thing. The Book of Lao Tzu uses "formed out of chaos" to describe the Tao, which shows that the Tao it refers to is basically material.

Group A says: No, Zhuangzi can prove it. The "Zhibei You" chapter of "Zhuangzi" says: "Is there something born before heaven and earth? That which makes things is not a thing, for a thing cannot precede a thing." Group A believes that these sentences explain what the Book of Lao Tzu calls "something formed out of chaos, born before heaven and earth," indicating that "that which is born before heaven and earth is not a thing."

The argument in "Zhibei You" is roughly like this. For example, we say that all ducks are born from ducks. Someone says: That's not right, because "all ducks" includes all ducks. Since this is the case, it is impossible to have a duck outside of "all ducks" to give birth to all ducks. Therefore, it cannot be said that all ducks are born from ducks, but only that all ducks are born from non-ducks. "Zhibei You" does not explicitly state the procedure of this argument, but it says, "a thing cannot precede a thing," and that "that which precedes a thing" must be "non-thing." Its argument is probably as shown in the above metaphor.

I believe that the point raised in "Zhibei You" precisely illustrates the difference between Zhuangzi and the Book of Lao Tzu. Because the Book of Lao Tzu, after saying "As a thing, the Tao is elusive and vague," clearly says, "Vague, oh vague, in it there is an image; elusive, oh elusive, in it there is substance." This "substance" cannot be interpreted as "a general thing." This "substance" must be understood as a material thing. The "it" in "in it" refers to the Tao. If there is a material thing in the Tao, then the Tao itself must be fundamentally a material thing. Of course, the Tao is different from general things, because it is not a certain kind of thing, so it is said to be nameless, and it is also invisible and intangible, so it is said to be formless.

Some people in Group A use arguments similar to the ones mentioned above to prove that the Tao in the Book of Lao Tzu is non-material, although the reasons they cite are not necessarily the same. Some people say that the heaven, earth, and myriad things mentioned in the Book of Lao Tzu are nature; the Tao gives birth to heaven, earth, and myriad things, which means that the Tao is above nature; above nature is supernatural; that which is supernatural must be God or an absolute idea. Others also say that Lao Tzu's so-called heaven, earth, and myriad things are the entirety of the universe, and that the Tao gives birth to heaven, earth, and myriad things, which means that the Tao is above the universe. Therefore, the Tao must be a timeless and spaceless absolute idea.

These arguments all impose some modern philosophical concepts on the philosophical system expounded in the Book of Lao Tzu. Are the heaven, earth, and myriad things mentioned in the Book of Lao Tzu equivalent to the "nature" and "universe" spoken of in modern philosophy? This is precisely what needs to be proven. I don't think they are equal. I think it is difficult to have such all-encompassing concepts like "nature" and "universe" in pre-Qin philosophy.

The Book of Lao Tzu does not regard heaven, earth, and myriad things as a whole, saying that the Tao suddenly gave birth to heaven, earth, and myriad things. It says: "Unnamed, the beginning of heaven and earth; named, the mother of all things" (Chapter 1). This means: Heaven and earth began from the unnamed; after there was heaven and earth, heaven and earth were named. From the named heaven and earth, the myriad things were born. Heaven and earth are the mother of the myriad things. (These two sentences can also be read as: non-being, names the beginning of heaven and earth; being, names the mother of all things.) The Book of Lao Tzu also says: "The myriad things under heaven are born from being; being is born from non-being" (Chapter 40). This also means the same as above. It is worth noting that it says here that "the myriad things under heaven" are born from being, not that "heaven, earth, and myriad things" are born from being.

How did heaven and earth begin from the unnamed? The Book of Lao Tzu says: "The Tao begets one, one begets two, two begets three, and three begets the myriad things. The myriad things carry yin and embrace yang, blending their energy to achieve harmony" (Chapter 42). There are three kinds of energy mentioned here: blending energy, yin energy, and yang energy. I think the so-called blending energy is one, yin and yang are two, and three meant many in the pre-Qin period. Two begets three means that once there is yin and yang, many things are born. Then what kind of energy is blending energy? According to the process of the universe's origin described in the later "Huainanzi," before there was heaven and earth, there was a kind of chaotic and undifferentiated energy. Later, this energy differentiated, with the light and clear energy rising to become heaven and the heavy and turbid energy sinking to become earth. This is the beginning of heaven and earth. The light and clear energy is yang energy, and the heavy and turbid energy is yin energy. The energy in this state, when yin and yang energies began to differentiate but were not yet fully differentiated, is called blending energy. "Blending" is a characteristic of the Tao. "The Tao is blending, yet its use is inexhaustible" (Chapter 4). This energy that has not yet fully differentiated is almost the same as the Tao, so it is called blending energy. It is also called one.

"Huainanzi" says: "The Tao covers heaven and carries earth, receiving formlessness, its source flowing like a spring, blending and slowly filling, swirling and gurgling, turbid and slowly clearing" (Yuandao Xun). This passage can be used as an annotation for what the Book of Lao Tzu calls "something formed out of chaos." It also says: "The so-called one is that which has no equal in the world. Standing upright, solitary and alone, connecting to the nine heavens above and penetrating the nine fields below, round without conforming to the compass, square without conforming to the square, greatly unified into one, like leaves piled up without roots, embracing heaven and earth, it is the gateway to the Tao." "Therefore, when the gong note is established, the five tones are formed; when the sweet flavor is established, the five flavors are determined; when the white color is established, the five colors are completed; when the Tao is established as one, the myriad things are born" (ibid.). According to these words, one has almost the same characteristics as the Tao, but it is "the gateway to the Tao." That is, the state in which primordial chaotic energy begins to differentiate but has not yet fully transformed. From this beginning, the myriad things are born, so it is said that "when one is established, the myriad things are born." This is my preliminary explanation of blending energy. Wang Anshi once proposed this view (Peng Si's annotation to Chapter 4 of the Daode Jing cites Wang Anshi's annotation). Whether it is correct or not requires further research.

Some people in Group A say that according to the Book of Lao Tzu, the relationship between the Tao and the myriad things is like the relationship between father and son, which is different from the atomism in Greek philosophy. Atomism in Greek philosophy believes that concrete things are composed of atoms, which means that atoms are within things, not above or before them. I think that the Book of Lao Tzu's "deep, it seems to be the ancestor of the myriad things" and "preceding the image of the Emperor" are just figurative expressions, hence the use of the words "seems" and "image." "Huainanzi" accurately explains that qi constitutes the myriad things, but it also says: "The formless is the great ancestor of things, and the soundless is the great progenitor of sounds" (Yuandao Xun). This is a metaphor. The Book of Lao Tzu also says: "The great Tao flows everywhere, it can be turned to the left or right, the myriad things depend on it for life and do not refuse" (Chapter 34). "When the uncarved wood is broken up, it becomes utensils" (Chapter 28). It can be seen that the Tao is also within the myriad things.

From the above, it seems that Group A has modernized the philosophical system expounded in the Book of Lao Tzu, perhaps it can be said that it has Hegelianized it. After "transforming" it in this way, it is of course idealistic. The question is whether it should be "transformed" in this way.

Group B believes that the Tao in the Book of Lao Tzu is a material entity, and then explains the Tao in the Book of Lao Tzu according to our current understanding of the meaning of material entity, which also creates difficulties. The Book of Lao Tzu says: "The Tao is always nameless, uncarved wood. Although small, the world dares not subjugate it. If lords and kings can abide by it, the myriad things will naturally submit" (Chapter 32). If the Tao is only a material entity, would the myriad things submit if lords and kings abided by a material entity? It is obviously illogical. We will discuss this further below. Now let's talk about the second point mentioned above.

The second point is that to discuss Lao Tzu, we must start from Lao Tzu's true face. To understand Lao Tzu's true face, we must seriously rely on the Book of Lao Tzu but not be limited to it. To discuss Lao Tzu, we must rely on the Book of Lao Tzu, which is of course the case. What I am saying now is to seriously rely on the Book of Lao Tzu. That is to say, the understanding of the Book of Lao Tzu must be closely related to the words of the Book of Lao Tzu, without taking chapters out of context, interpreting words literally, or making far-fetched associations. Some people in Group A believe that Chapter 21 of the Book of Lao Tzu talks about the process of the Tao giving birth to the myriad things: "As a thing, the Tao is elusive and vague; vague, oh vague, in it there is an image; elusive, oh elusive, in it there is substance." According to Zhuangzi's interpretation, the Tao is "non-thing," but it gives birth to substance in its vagueness. If the Book of Lao Tzu said, "The Tao's giving birth to substance is elusive and vague," this interpretation would be correct, but the Book of Lao Tzu clearly says, "As a thing, the Tao," not "The Tao's giving birth to substance." The "Doctrine of the Mean" says, "In its being a thing, it is not two, then its giving birth to things is unfathomable." "Its being a thing" and "its giving birth to things" are two different things. I am not citing the "Doctrine of the Mean" to talk about "Lao Tzu," but only citing it to illustrate a grammatical issue. I believe that this interpretation of Group A is not closely related to the words of the original text.

Why do I say that we should not be limited to the Book of Lao Tzu? Because the text of the Book of Lao Tzu is simple, and some important nouns appear only once or twice in the book. For example, "in it there is essence." Essence is a very important noun, but within the scope of the Book of Lao Tzu alone, it is impossible to determine what essence is. If we understand "in it there is essence" according to what we now understand as essence, that is what is called interpreting words literally. In fact, there are many special terms in pre-Qin Taoist thought. We must collect all the Taoist thought materials from the pre-Qin period to the Han Dynasty, and conduct an analytical and comparative study, and then we can determine the meaning of the terms they used, so that we can avoid the error of interpreting words literally. According to the "Tianxia" chapter, Guan Yin and Lao Dan "lived indifferently and alone with spirits." It also says that Zhuang Zhou "alone communes with the spirit of heaven and earth." If we understand these two sentences according to what we now understand as spirit and spirits, then we can conclude that the "Tianxia" chapter believes that the philosophy of Lao Dan and Zhuang Zhou is idealistic. In fact, the problem is not that simple.

The so-called "essence," "spirit," and "brightness" all have definite references in pre-Qin Taoist thought. The "Neiye" chapter of "Guanzi" says: "Essence is the finest of qi." "Essence" is extremely subtle qi. According to the description in the "Neiye" chapter, it is an extremely subtle moving substance, which is also called spirit and also called brightness. Not only in the "Neiye" and other four chapters of "Guanzi" does "essence" have this meaning, but also in the book of Zhuangzi, the so-called "essence" also has this meaning. This was a term used by Taoists at that time. I understand the "in it there is essence" in the Book of Lao Tzu according to this meaning. The difference between the Book of Lao Tzu and Zhuangzi is not in their understanding of "essence" being different, but in Lao Tzu believing that "essence" is in the Tao, while Zhuangzi said "spirit is born from the Tao" (Zhibei You), and that the Tao is above "essence." Therefore, I believe that the philosophical thought of the Book of Lao Tzu is fundamentally materialistic, while the philosophical thought of Zhuangzi is fundamentally idealistic. Of course, it can also be said that Zhuangzi's so-called "spirit is born from the Tao" is just a figurative expression, and the Tao and essence are still consistent. This issue can be further studied.

The Book of Lao Tzu says: "The Tao is always nameless, uncarved wood. Although small, the world dares not subjugate it" (Chapter 32). This "uncarved wood" is also another name for the Tao. Grammatically, it should be so, and logically, it should also be so. Chapter 37 says: "When civilization arises and desires emerge, I will suppress them with the nameless uncarved wood." If "uncarved wood" is something else, how could it have such a great effect? And what thing is it that "although small, the world dares not subjugate"? I think this is said about the Tao as fine qi. Guanzi's "Neiye" chapter says that essence is "so small that there is nothing inside, so large that there is nothing outside." The "small" mentioned here in the Book of Lao Tzu refers to "so small that there is nothing inside."

The Book of Lao Tzu also says: "He who possesses abundant virtue is like a newborn child... Not yet knowing the union of male and female, yet his genitals are fully developed, this is the perfection of essence. Crying all day without becoming hoarse, this is the perfection of harmony" (Chapter 55). The word "essence" is used here as an adjective, but its meaning still refers to "he who possesses abundant virtue." The Taoist so-called virtue is what a person or thing obtains from the Tao, what is obtained from essence. The newborn child has not yet lost the essence he has obtained, so he has that kind of situation. "The perfection of harmony" is related to blending energy, "blending their energy to achieve harmony." The newborn child has obtained blending energy and has not yet lost it, so he can achieve "the perfection of harmony." Zhuangzi's "Zhibei You" says: "If you correct your form and unify your vision, heavenly harmony will arrive." I think "heavenly harmony" is blending energy.

According to Taoist sayings at the time, essence-qi was also called spiritual qi, and people's intelligence and wisdom all came from the essence-qi they possessed. The Taoist so-called attainment of the Tao mainly means obtaining more of the essence-qi within the Tao. To obtain more essence-qi, one must have no knowledge and no desires in one's heart, like an empty house, so that essence-qi can gather more. This is the original meaning of the Book of Lao Tzu's "reducing day by day in the pursuit of the Tao."

Therefore, the Taoist so-called "Tao," "essence," and "qi" have a mysterious aspect. Group B should acknowledge this aspect. It should be acknowledged that the Tao in the Book of Lao Tzu is material, but not completely material.

Group A may say that according to this statement, the philosophy of the Book of Lao Tzu and other Taoists is simply a kind of hylozoism or objective idealism, and cannot be called materialism.

But we cannot demand too much of ancient materialistic thought. Let's look at the situation in Western philosophical history. In Greek philosophy, Heraclitus believed that the soul was material, a state transformed from fire (Tunick et al., "History of Philosophy," Vol. 1, p. 78); Anaxagoras understood "Nous" (i.e., world intelligence) as extremely thin and light objects (ibid., p. 93). Democritus believed that the soul, like fire, was a combination of round, dynamic atoms, and that the soul was the principle of fire in the body (ibid., p. 99). Lucretius believed that the soul and spirit were material, composed of extremely fine and tiny atoms (ibid., p. 155). Even Cassandi in the 17th century believed that the human soul was also a body composed of special moving, tiny fire atoms. Following Epicurus, Cassandi said that the soul is tangible, because if it were intangible, it would be like emptiness (ibid., p. 435). Cassandi also said: "The soul is a pure, transparent, and rarefied entity, like a gentle breeze, suddenly passing through your entire body, or at least through the brain and its parts, making them alive and invigorating, and performing all the functions you consider to be your own" (ibid., p. 437).

The Tao in the Book of Lao Tzu is very similar to the "Nous" spoken of by Anaxagoras, on the one hand, it is "world intelligence," and on the other hand, it is extremely fine qi. The situation of the soul entering the body described by Cassandi is precisely what Chinese Taoist cultivation seeks to achieve.

If someone were to propose these ideas now, they could be said to be hylozoism or objective idealism. But modern philosophical historians include them in the camp of materialism. Because we must evaluate them from a historical perspective, and cannot measure them by modern materialistic standards.

I believe that if Group B does not overemphasize the materialistic thought expounded in the Book of Lao Tzu, and Group A does not demand too much of pre-Qin materialistic thought, the disputes between the two sides may be reduced by a large part.

I cited "Guanzi" and "Huainanzi" above to explain Lao Tzu, because only such a comprehensive study can solve the problem. Of course, it is always dangerous to cite materials other than Lao Tzu to explain Lao Tzu. Group B says that Group A's use of Zhuangzi to explain Lao Tzu, "explaining Lao Tzu with Zhuangzi," is incorrect, and Group A can also say that my use of Guanzi to explain Lao Tzu and Huainanzi to explain Lao Tzu is also incorrect. The question is not what to use to explain Lao Tzu, but how to explain it in a way that conforms to the original meaning of the Book of Lao Tzu.

One point that can be noted is that from Lao Tzu onwards, in addition to Zhuangzi developing the idealistic elements in the Book of Lao Tzu, the interpretations of Lao Tzu by Han Fei's Explanation of Lao Tzu and Similes of Lao Tzu, Huainanzi, and He Shanggong's Annotation to Lao Tzu all use a materialistic perspective to interpret Lao Tzu. It was not until Wang Bi's Annotation to Lao Tzu that the philosophical thought of the Book of Lao Tzu was interpreted as idealistic. This fact may illustrate a point.

    关于老子哲学的两个问题
    冯友兰	（续完）
    现在谈第二个问题。
    上面说到先秦哲学的派别，沿用了儒家道家等名词，也就是沿用了从汉朝刘歆以来把先秦的学派分为六家或十家的说法。这个说法，也有一定的事实根据，但不完全是科学的。在许多家里面，都有唯心主义和唯物主义的斗争。在儒家里面，孟子是唯心主义的代表，荀子是唯物主义的代表，这是现在大家都承认的。在道家的范围内，就“天下篇”所举的四派说，其中彭蒙田骈慎到一派，因为材料不足，暂可不论，就其余三派说：宋尹学派，现在比较多数人都认为是唯心主义的。我也属于这些多数人之内。但是对于老聃这一派，大家意见就分歧了。有一部分人认为老子书所讲的哲学思想，基本上是唯心主义的。这一派人以下称为甲方；还有一部分人认为老子书所讲的哲学思想，基本上是唯物主义的；这一部分人以下称为乙方，我是属于乙方的。附带声明一句，在一个月以前，光明日报有个报道说：在北京大学中国哲学史教研室里讨论老子的时候，我主张老子书所讲的哲学思想是唯心主义的，后来我放弃这个意见。这个报道是不确实的。在解放以前，我没有考虑老子书所讲的哲学思想是唯物主义的或是唯心主义的。在解放以后，我一直认为它是唯物主义的。还有一点要提到的，就是对于第二问题的甲方乙方和对于第一问题的甲方乙方并不是一致的。有些人对于第一问题是属于甲方，对于第二问题属于乙方，也有相反的情形。
    首先要说明的就是：现在甲方的大多数人也承认老子书所讲的哲学思想有唯物主义的成分，甚至有相当大的唯物主义的成分。乙方的大多数人也承认老子书所讲的哲学思想有唯心主义的成分，甚至有相当大的唯心主义成分。关于这一点，两方的争论不大。两方争论的焦点是：老子书所讲的哲学思想，究竟基本上是唯物主义的或是唯心主义的。就是说，在老子书所讲的哲学思想中，占主导地位的，究竟是唯物主义或是唯心主义？关于这个中心的问题，甲乙两方都作了很多的辩论，提出了各自的论据，但是一直到现在，无论那一方都还没有把对方说服，成为相持不下的局面。
    造成这种局面的一个原因，当然由于上面所说的老子书是“文约义丰”，很多关系重要的句子，不但可以有不同的解释，而且还有不同的断句。举个例说吧，乙方的人认为老子书所谓有、无，就是有名和无名的简称，举第一章“无名，天地之始，有名，万物之母”为例。甲方说：不对，你的念法就不对，应该念：“无，名天地之始，有，名万物之母”。甲方认为道是常无与常有的统一，而常无是根本的一方面，举第一章“常无，欲以观其妙，常有，欲以观其侥”为例。乙方说：不对，你的念法就不对，应该念“常无欲，以观其妙，常有欲，以观其侥。”写老子书的人原来没有用标点符号，像这些字句，究竟应该怎么念，是死无对证的。像这一类的争论，可以继续下去，但是得不出什么结论。
    我举这个例，说明关于老子的辩论，有些是双方杀来杀去，各执一词，专在这些方面下功夫，不能解决问题。要想解决问题，要先考虑讨论的方法，在讨论方法上，我认为应该注意两点。
    第一点是，不要把老子哲学现代化。我在上面说，老子书所讲的哲学体系，相当完整，这是按先秦的标准说的，就现代哲学的标准说，应该承认古代的哲学思想，都是简单的，素朴的，远没有现代哲学思想复杂和细致。就现在关于老子哲学的辩论看起来，无论甲方或乙方，都有把老子书所讲的哲学思想现代化的倾向。甲方一谈，往往就把老子书所说的道，谈成类似黑格尔的绝对观念。于是乎就把黑格尔绝对观念的性质，譬如绝对、超时空等等，都给道安上。我觉得先秦的哲学家，不会有这样的想法，因为他们的思想，不会这样的细致。乙方一谈，就往往把老子书所说的道，说成是一个“物质的实体”，于是乎就认为老子书所说的道就真是像现代唯物主义所说的物质，其中没有一点神秘的成分；这显然也是不对的。在古代哲学里边，没有极纯粹的物质的概念。就是晚出的唯物主义哲学家，例如张载、王夫之等，他们所说的气，不能说不是物质，但是其中也有神秘的成分。因此，甲方所讲的老子书的唯心主义，未免有所夸张。乙方所讲的老子书的唯物主义，也未免有所夸张。甲乙两方的辩论，有一部分是由于这些夸张而起。
    老子书说：“有物混成，先天地生”（二十五章），又说：“道之为物，惟恍惟惚。”（二十一章）这两个“物”字，可以解释为“一般的东西”，在这几句话里，老子书不过是说：有那么一个混成的东西，先于天地就存在了；道那个东西，是恍惚的。老子书的这几句话，虽然其中有“物”字，但并没有说明道是一个精神性的或是物质性的东西。这一点，是甲乙双方都承认的。但是乙方认为“混成”两个字只能作为一个物质性的东西的形容词。老子书用“混成”形容道，就说明它所说的道基本上是物质性的。
    甲方说：不然，有庄子为证。“庄子”“知北游”篇说：“有先天地生者物邪？物物者非物，物出不得先物也。”甲方认为这几句话正是解老子书所说的“有物混成先天地生”，说明“先天地生者非物”。
    “知北游”的论证，大概是这样。譬如我们说，所有的鸭子都是鸭子生出来的。有人说：这话不对，因为“所有的鸭子”，就是把一切的鸭子都包括在内了。既然如此，那就不可能于“所有的鸭子”之外还有一个鸭子来生所有的鸭子。因此，不能说所有的鸭子都是鸭子生的，只能说，所有的鸭子都是非鸭子生的。“知北游”没有明确地说出这个论证的程序，但是它说，“物出不得先物也”，“先物者”一定是“非物”，它的论证，大概如上的比喻。
    我认为“知北游”所提的这个论点，正是说明庄子和老子书的不同。因为老子书在“道之为物，唯恍唯惚”的下边，明白地说“惚兮恍兮，其中有象，恍兮惚兮，其中有物，”这个“物”字，可不能作为“一般的东西”解。这个“物”必须了解为物质性的东西。“其中”的“其”字指道。道中有物质性的东西，道本身也必然基本上是物质性的东西了。当然，道与一般的物，是有所不同，因为它不是某一种类的物，因此说它是无名，它也是看不见摸不着的，因此说它是无形。
    甲方有人用类似上面所说的辩论，证明老子书所说的道是非物质性的，虽然他们所举的理由不一定是相同的。有人说，老子书所说的天地万物，就是自然；道生天地万物，那就是说道在自然之上；在自然之上，就是超自然；超自然的，就一定是上帝或绝对观念之类。也有人说，老子所谓天地万物，就是宇宙的全体，说道生天地万物，就是道在宇宙之上，因此，道必然是一个超时空的绝对观念。
    这些辩论，都是把一些近代哲学的观念，强加于老子书所讲的哲学体系。老子书所说的天地万物，是不是等于现代哲学所说的
  “自然”和“宇宙”，这正是需要证明的。我认为它们并不相等。我认为像“自然”和“宇宙”这样概括一切的概念，在先秦哲学中是很难有的。
    老子书没有把天地万物作为一个整体，说道一下子就把天地万物生出来，它说：“无名，天地之始；有名，万物之母。”（一章）这是说：天地是从无名开始的；有了天地以后，天地就是有名的。从有名的天地，生出万物，天地是万物的母。（这两句如果念为无，名天地之始；有，名万物之母也可以。）老子书又说：“天下万物生于有；有生于无。”（四十章）也是上面所说的意思，可注意的是，它在这里说的是，“天下”万物生于有，并不是说“天地”万物生于有。
    天地怎么样从无名开始的？老子书说：“道生一，一生二，二生三，三生万物，万物负阴而抱阳，冲气以为和。”（四十二章）这里说的有三种气：冲气、阴气、阳气。我认为所谓冲气就是一，阴阳是二，三在先秦是多数的意思，二生三就是说，有了阴阳，很多的东西就生出来了。那么冲气究竟是那一种气呢？照后来“淮南子”所讲的宇宙发生的程序说，在还没有天地的时候，有一种混沌未分的气，后来这种气起了分化，轻清的气上浮为天，重浊的气下沉为地，这就是天地之始。轻清的气就是阳气，重浊的气就是阴气。在阴阳二气开始分化而还没有完全分化的时候，在这种情况中的气就叫做冲气。“冲”是道的一种性质，“道冲而用之或不盈。”（四章）这种尚未完全分化的气，与道还差不多，所以叫冲气。也叫做一。
      “淮南子”说：“夫道者复天载地，禀授无形，源流泉滂，冲而徐盈，混混汩汩，浊而徐清。”（原道训）这一段话，可以作为老子书所说的“有物混成”的注解。又说：“所谓一者，无匹合于天下者也。卓然独立，块然独处，上通九天，下贯九野，员不中规，方不中矩，大浑而为一，叶累而无根，怀囊天地，为道关门”。“故音者宫立而五音形矣，味者甘立而五味亭矣，色者白立而五色成矣，道者一立而万物生矣。”（同上）照这些话看起来，一所有的性质跟道差不多，不过它是“为道关门”。就是原始混沌的气开始分化，而尚未化的状态。这样一开始，万物就生出来了，所以说“一立而万物生”。这是我对于冲气的初步解释。这个意见，王安石曾经提过。（“彭耜”道德真经集注四章引王安石注）究竟对不对，还要作进一步的研究。
    甲方有人说，照老子书所说，道和万物的关系，是如父子的关系，这就跟希腊哲学中的原子论不同。希腊哲学中的原子论，认为具体的事物是原子所构成的，那就是说，原子就在事物之中，而不是在其上或在其先。我认为老子书所说的“渊兮似万物之宗”，
  “象帝之先”，不过是一种形象式的说法，所以用“似”字和“象”字。“淮南子”确切说明气构成万物，可是它也说：“夫无形者物之大祖也，无音者声之大宗也。”（原道训）这是一种比喻。老子书也说：“大道泛兮其可左右，万物恃之而生而不辞。”（三十四章）“朴散则为器。”（二十八章）可见道也就在万物之中。
    由上面看起来，甲方是把老子书所讲的哲学体系现代化了，也许可以说是把它黑格尔化了。把它这样“化”了以后，它当然是唯心主义的了。问题在于是不是应该这样“化”。
    乙方认为老子书所说的道，是物质实体，然后就照我们现在所了解的物质实体的意义去讲老子书所说的道，这样也就发生了困难。老子书说：“道常无名，朴，虽小，天下不敢臣，侯王若能守之，万物将自宾。”（三十二章）若说道仅只是物质实体，侯王守着一个物质实体，万物都会宾服吗？显然是讲不通的。这一点我们以下再谈。现在先谈上面所说的第二点。
    第二点是，要讨论老子，必须从老子的真面目讨论起。要想了解老子的真面目，就必须认真地以老子书为依据而又不局限于老子书。讨论老子，必须以老子书为依据，这是当然的。我现在说的是要认真地以老子书为依据。就是说，对于老子书的了解，必须与老子书的字句丝丝入扣，不可断章取义，也不可望文生义，更不可牵强附会。甲方有人认为老子书二十一章讲的是道生万物的程序：“道之为物，惟恍惟惚，惚兮恍兮，其中有象，恍兮惚兮，其中有物。”依庄子的解释，道是“非物”，可是它在恍惚之中就生出物来了。如果老子书说：“道之生物，惟恍惟惚”，这种解释就对了，可是老子书明是说：“道之为物”，不是说“道之生物”。“中庸”说：“其为物也不二，则其生物不测”。“其为物”和“其生物”是两回事。我不是引“中庸”讲“老子”，只是引它说明一个文法问题。我认为甲方的这种解释，就不是和原文的字句丝丝入扣。
    为什么又说不局限于老子书呢？因为老子书文字简单，有些重要的名词，在书中仅只一两见。例如“其中有精”，精是个很重要名词，但是专在老子书的范围内，不能确定精是什么。如果拿现在我们所了解的精去了解“其中有精”，那就是所谓望文生义。其实，先秦道家思想，有不少的特殊的术语，我们必须把先秦以至于汉代，所有的道家思想资料收集在一起，作一种分析的比较的研究，然后才可以确定它们所用的术语的意义，这样，才能不犯望文生义的错误。就“天下篇”所说，关尹老聃“淡然独与神明居”。又说，庄周“独与天地精神往来”。如果照我们现在所了解的精神与神明去了解这两句话，那就可以断定说，“天下篇”认为老聃和庄周的哲学是唯心主义的。其实问题没有这么简单。
    所谓“精”“神”和“明”，在先秦的道家思想里面，都是确有所指。“管子”“内业”篇说：“精也者气之精者也”。“精”就是极细微的气。照“内业”篇的描写看起来，它是一种极细微的动着的物质，它也称为神，也称为明。这不仅在“管子”“内业”等四篇所谓“精”是这个意义，就是在庄子书里边所谓“精”，也是这个意义。这是当时道家的一个术语。我是照这个意义去了解老子书所说的“其中有精”。老子书和庄子的不同，并不在于他们所了解的“精”不同，而在于老子认为“精”就在道之中，而庄子说“精神生于道”（知北游），道在“精”之上。因此我认为老子书的哲学思想是基本上唯物主义的，而庄子的哲学思想则基本上是唯心主义的。当然，也可以说，庄子所谓“精神生于道”，也不过是一种形象的说法，道与精也还是一致的。这个问题可以再研究。
    老子书说：“道常无名，朴，虽小，天下不敢臣。”（三十二章）这个“朴”也就是道的别名，照文法上讲，应该是如此，按义理讲也应该是如此。三十七章说：“化而欲作，吾将镇之以无名之朴，”如果“朴”是另外一个东西，怎么会有这样大的作用？又有什么东西“虽小，天下不敢臣”呢？我认为这是就道之为精气说的。管子“内业”篇说，精是“其小无内，其大无外。”老子书这里所说“小”就是就“其小无内”说的。
    老子书又说：“含德之厚，比于赤子”，“未知牝牡之合而峻作，精之至也。终日号而不哑，和之至也。”（五十五章）这个“精”字是作为形容词用，但是它的意思还是说“含德之厚”。道家所谓德，就是一个人或物所得于道，所得于精的。赤子得到精还没有失去，所以有那种情况。“和之至也”与冲气有关，“冲气以为和”。赤子得了冲气，还没有失去，所以能“和之至”。“庄子”“知北游”说：“若正汝形，一汝视，天和将至。”我认为“天和”就是冲气。
    照当时道家的说法，精气也称为灵气，人的聪明智慧都是从他们所有的精气来的。道家所说的得道，主要是说得到更多的道里面的精气。要得更多的精气，必须心里边无知无欲像一个空虚的房子一样，精气才能更多的聚集起来。这就是老子书所说的“为道日损”的本来的意义。
    所以道家所谓“道”，“精”，“气”，是有其神秘的一方面。乙方应该承认这一方面。应该承认老子书所说的道，是物质性的。但是还不完全是物质性的。
    甲方可以说，照这样说起来，老子书和其他道家的哲学思想，简直是一种物活论或客观唯心主义，说不上什么唯物主义。
    但是我们不能对于古代的唯物主义思想要求太高。我们看一看西方哲学史里边的情况。在希腊哲学里，赫拉克利特认为灵魂是物质的，是火转化的一种状态；（敦尼克等“哲学史”第一册78页）阿那克萨哥拉把“奴斯”（即世界智慧）了解为极薄和极轻的物体。（同上，93页）德漠克利特认为灵魂像火一样，是圆形的、能动的原子的结合，灵魂是肉体中的火的本原。（同上，99页）卢克莱茨认为灵魂和精神是物质的，它们是由极其精微细小的原子构成的。（同上，155页）一直到十七世纪的咖桑狄还认为人的灵魂也是由特殊的运动着的微小的火的原子构成的物体。随伊壁鸠鲁之后，咖桑狄说，灵魂是有形的，因为如果它是无形的，那末它就会和虚空一样。（同上，435页）咖桑狄并且说：“灵魂乃是一种纯洁的、透明的和稀薄的实体，像一股轻风似的，突然透过你的整个身体，或至少透过大脑及其各部分，使它们生气勃勃，并且在那里执行一切你认为是属于自己的职能。”（同上，437页）
    老子书所说的道，很像阿那克萨哥拉所说的“奴斯”，一方面是“世界智慧”，一方面又是极细微的气。咖桑狄所描写的灵魂进入身体的情况，正是中国道家修道所要得到的。
    这些思想，如果现在有人提出来，倒可以说是物活论或客观唯心主义。但是现代的哲学史家都把它们列入唯物主义的阵营。因为我们要从历史主义的观点对它们作估价，不能拿现代的唯物主义标准衡量它们。
    我认为如果乙方对于老子书所讲的唯物主义思想，不要过分夸张，甲方对于先秦的唯物主义思想不要要求过高，两方的争执或者就可以减少一大部分。
    我上面引了“管子”和“淮南子”解释老子，因为只有这样综合的研究，才能解决问题。当然，引证老子以外的材料来解释老子，总是有危险的。乙方说甲方以庄子解释老子，“以庄解老”是不对的，甲方也可说我以管解老，以淮南解老也是不对的。问题不在于以什么解老，而在于怎么样解能合乎老子书的本来意思。
    有一点可以注意。从老子以后，除了庄子发展老子书中唯心主义的成分以外，解释老子的有韩非的解老喻老，淮南子和河上公老子注，都是用唯物主义的观点解释老子。直到王弼的老子注，才把老子书的哲学思想解释为唯心主义。这个事实也许说明一点问题吧。
