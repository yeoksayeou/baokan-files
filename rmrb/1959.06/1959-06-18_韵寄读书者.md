Don't laugh at the bookworm, the bookworm loves to devour books.
Explore the past for present use, combine Chinese and foreign.
Integrate the ancient and modern, embrace both China and the world, learning should be as rich as five carts of books.
Practice splits heaven and earth, theory naturally unfolds.
Two wings make a bird, two wheels make a carriage.
To travel far, start from nearby, to seek speed, begin with slowness.
From extensive to concise, find the source and be joyful.
It is gratifying that our people have created a prosperous age, the country soars and is praised across the world.
Brandish divine arms to overcome thorns, recover confidence and excavate treasures.
Since we take benevolence as our responsibility, we don't fear the long road and slow donkey.
May I wish those who return from arduous battles, a cup of clear tea in the study.

    韵寄读书者
    孙定国
    人莫嘲蠹鱼，蠹鱼喜蛀书。探古为今用，中外两相予，古今兼中外，学宜富五车。实践劈天地，理论自卷舒，双翼方为鸟，两轮乃成舆。行远必自迩，求疾宜先徐，由博以返约，逢源乐有余。堪喜吾人创盛世，国家飞翔四海誉，挥动神臂披荆棘，收回放心挖宝储。既然仁以为己任，那怕道远策蹇驴，愿祝苦战归来者，清茶一盏坐书庐。
