The U.S. imperialism is actively instigating the "Organization of American States" and six Central American countries to intervene in the Cuban Revolution and suppress the burgeoning national democratic movement in the Caribbean, using the situation in Nicaragua as a pretext.

According to reports, the "Organization of American States," manipulated by the United States, held two consecutive special meetings in Washington on June 3rd and 4th. Under the guise of "investigating" the situation in Nicaragua, the meetings decided to establish a "Four-Nation Committee" composed of representatives from the United States, Brazil, Mexico, and Uruguay, to interfere in the recent anti-dictatorial armed struggle that broke out in Nicaragua. This "Four-Nation Committee" held a working meeting on the 6th.

According to a report from United Press International, the "Organization of American States" has already requested the foreign ministers of thirteen countries in the Caribbean region, including the United States, to urgently provide information on whether the so-called "turmoil" in the Caribbean "constitutes a threat to the peace of the entire hemisphere." The news said that "the so-called extensive investigation of the Caribbean region is probably to investigate such signs of tension as the Cuban Revolution, the recent failed invasion of Panama, and rumors about Cuban-based rebels possibly invading Haiti and the Dominican Republic."

The United States' overbearing practice of using the "Organization of American States" to interfere in the internal affairs of Caribbean countries has been strongly opposed by the representatives of Cuba, Venezuela, and Bolivia to the "Organization of American States." At the "Organization of American States" meeting on the 3rd, Cuban representative Raúl Roa sternly refuted the unreasonable demand of the Nicaraguan dictatorial regime to the "Organization of American States" to intervene in the Nicaraguan situation based on the "Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance." Raúl Roa believed that the armed struggle that broke out in Nicaragua did not pose a threat to any American country and should therefore be resolved by Nicaragua itself. The representatives of Venezuela and Bolivia also opposed Nicaragua's request at the meeting on the 3rd. However, under the manipulation of U.S. representative Dreier John, the "Organization of American States" meeting on the 4th passed a resolution by a vote of seventeen to two (with Bolivia abstaining) to establish a "Four-Nation Committee" to "investigate" the situation in Nicaragua. According to reports, Raúl Roa stated before attending the closed-door testimony session of the committee that the so-called Cuban dispatch of reinforcements to help the Nicaraguan anti-dictatorial armed forces was a complete fabrication. He emphasized that Cuba opposed the investigation and that "the Organization of American States must not be used as a powder keg by those who like to play with fire."

According to a dispatch from Agence France-Presse from Costa Rica on the 7th, Enrique Lacayo Farfán, the leader of the Nicaraguan anti-dictatorial armed forces, wrote a letter to Julio Lacarte, the chairman of the "Four-Nation Committee." In the letter, he expressed his firm opposition to "all foreign interference in Nicaraguan affairs."

While using the "Organization of American States" to interfere in the internal affairs of Caribbean countries, the United States also instructed the interior ministers of six Central American countries to hold two consecutive days of meetings in Guatemala City on the 4th and 5th. According to reports, the meeting, under the guise of "preventing communist infiltration into the region," discussed and formulated specific measures and plans to suppress the growing national liberation movement and anti-dictatorial struggle in Central American countries. The news said that the meeting's spearhead was particularly aimed at Cuba.

According to reports, Guatemalan Interior Minister Salazar repeated the earlier proposal by U.S. Congressman Mathers regarding the establishment of an "Organization of American States" "police force" at the meeting. An article published by the U.S. "Washington Star" on May 14th regarding the above proposal pointed out that Mathers believed that "since Castro drove out the dictator and took power in Cuba, a storm has been brewing in the Caribbean region." Mathers stated that the "Organization of American States" has a responsibility to maintain "peace" in Latin America.

The news said that the meeting of the interior ministers of the six Central American countries also attempted to blame the increasing poverty of the people's lives in their respective countries and the strikes that had erupted as a result on "communist agitation," in order to further strengthen the suppression of the people. The news said that the decisions passed by the meeting required the governments of Central American countries to prohibit the printing and distribution of "communist propaganda booklets" aimed at undermining "democratic" reforms. At the same time, the meeting also stipulated that they should "coordinate their laws for suppressing communist activities."

### 害怕中美国家民族独立运动风起云涌  美国操纵“美洲国家组织”阴谋干涉  主要矛头指向古巴革命和尼加拉瓜反独裁斗争

    害怕中美国家民族独立运动风起云涌
    美国操纵“美洲国家组织”阴谋干涉
    主要矛头指向古巴革命和尼加拉瓜反独裁斗争
    本报综合报道　美帝国主义正在积极策动“美洲国家组织”和六个中美国家，以尼加拉瓜的局势为借口，干涉古巴革命和镇压加勒比海地区蓬勃发展的民族民主运动。
    据报道，由美国操纵的“美洲国家组织”在6月3、4两日连续在华盛顿召开了两次特别会议，会议以“调查”尼加拉瓜的局势为名，决定成立一个由美国、巴西、墨西哥和乌拉圭的代表组成的“四国委员会”，对尼加拉瓜最近爆发的反独裁武装斗争进行干涉。这个“四国委员会”在6日举行了工作会议。
    据合众国际社的一则报道透露，“美洲国家组织”已经向包括美国在内的加勒比海地区十三个国家的外长提出要求，要他们赶紧提出所谓加勒比海的“动乱”是否“构成对整个半球的和平威胁”的情报。这则消息说，“所谓对加勒比海地区进行广泛的调查，大概是调查这样一些预示出紧张的迹象：古巴革命、最近对巴拿马发动的失败的侵犯、以及关于以古巴为基地的叛乱分子可能入侵海地和多米尼加共和国的谣传”。
    美国利用“美洲国家组织”来干预加勒比海地区各国内政的蛮横做法，遭到了古巴、委内瑞拉和玻利维亚驻“美洲国家组织”代表的强烈反对。在3日举行的“美洲国家组织”会议上，古巴代表劳尔·罗阿严正地驳斥了尼加拉瓜独裁政权向“美洲国家组织”提出的请这个组织根据
  “泛美互助条约”对尼加拉瓜局势进行干涉的无理要求。劳尔·罗阿认为，在尼加拉瓜国内爆发的武装斗争，不造成对任何美洲国家的威胁，因此应该由尼加拉瓜自己去解决。委内瑞拉和玻利维亚的代表也在3日的会议上反对尼加拉瓜的要求。但是，在美国代表德赖尔·约翰操纵下，“美洲国家组织”4日会议上以十七票对二票（玻利维亚弃权）通过成立一个“四国委员会”来“调查”尼加拉瓜的局势。据报道，劳尔·罗阿在去参加这个委员会的作证秘密会议以前表示，所谓古巴派援军去帮助尼加拉瓜的反独裁武装队伍是彻头彻尾的捏造。他强调说，古巴反对进行调查，“美洲国家组织一定不能被喜欢玩火的人用来作为一个火药库那样”。
    据法新社7日从哥斯达黎加发出的一则电讯说，尼加拉瓜反独裁的武装部队领导人恩里克·拉卡约·德尔方曾给“四国委员会”主席胡利奥·拉卡特写了一封信。他在信中表示坚决反对“对尼加拉瓜事务的一切外来干涉”。
    美国在利用“美洲国家组织”干涉加勒比海地区国家内政的同时，还指使中美六个国家的内政部长在4、5两日连续在危地马拉城举行两天会议。据报道，这次会议以“防止共产主义对这一地区的渗透”作为幌子，讨论和制订出镇压中美各国日益增长的民族解放运动和反独裁斗争的具体办法和计划。消息说，这次会议的矛头特别针对了古巴。
    据报道，危地马拉内政部长萨拉萨尔在这次会议上重复了美国议员马瑟斯早先提出的关于成立“美洲国家组织”的“警察部队”的建议。美国“华盛顿明星报”5月14日就上述建议发表的一篇文章指出，马瑟斯认为，“由于卡斯特罗赶走了独裁者，并且在古巴执政，加勒比海地区就一直在酝酿着风暴”。马瑟斯表示，“美洲国家组织”有责任保持拉丁美洲的“和平”。
    消息说，中美六国内政部长会议还力图把由于美国的残酷掠夺所引起的国内人民生活的日益贫困并由此而爆发的罢工斗争归罪于“共产党人的煽动”，以便进一步加强对人民的镇压。消息说，会议通过的决定要求中美各国政府禁止印刷和散发旨在削弱“民主”改革的“共产党宣传册子”。同时，会议还规定要“协调它们镇压共产党活动的法律”。
