Leap Forward Showcase

    Beige Card Stock
    This is a new product recently successfully trial-produced by the Shanghai China Art Paper Mill. This paper is specially for printing "Chinese Painting Albums". Its surface is smooth, delicate, soft, and the color is beautiful.
    High-Voltage Cable Paper
    This is used for building cables for projects such as bridges and large hydropower stations, and the technical requirements are very high. In the past, our country could not manufacture it. During the Great Leap Forward, the workers of the Jiamusi Paper Mill and the Minfeng Paper Mill jointly successfully trial-produced it.
    Small Newspaper Paper
    Since 1958, a number of small paper mills using indigenous methods have been built in various places. These small paper mills adapt to local conditions, use local materials, and use local raw materials and simple methods to produce many small newspaper papers. For example, the Kaifeng City Paper Mill in Henan Province uses rice straw as raw material and uses iron-wood paper machines to make small newspaper paper for the Kaifeng Daily to print newspapers; the small newspaper paper produced by the Xixia County Paper Mill with local equipment has begun to solve the problem of paper use for some of the Xixia County newspaper.

    跃进橱窗
    米色卡纸
    这是上海中国版纸厂最近试制成功的一种新产品。这种纸是专供印刷“中国画册”用的。它的表面平滑、细致、柔软，色泽美观。
    高压电缆纸
  　这是供桥梁、大型水电站等工程建造电缆用的，技术上要求很高。过去我国不能制造。在大跃进中佳木斯造纸厂和民丰造纸厂职工们共同试制成功。
    小报纸
  　1958年以来，各地建成了一批用土法生产的小型纸厂。这些小纸厂因地制宜，就地取材，利用当地原料和简易的方法生产出许多小报纸。例如，河南省开封市造纸厂用稻草作原料，利用铁木纸机抄出了小报纸，供开封日报印报；西峡县造纸厂用土设备生产的小报纸，已开始解决了西峡县报一部分用纸问题。
