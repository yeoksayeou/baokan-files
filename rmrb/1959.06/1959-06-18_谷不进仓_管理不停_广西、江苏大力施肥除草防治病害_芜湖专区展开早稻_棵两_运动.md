　　Wuhu Prefecture Launches Early Rice "One Liang per Plant" Campaign

　　This newspaper, Nanning, 17th – After criticizing the “fixed outcome theory” regarding early rice, Guangxi has universally strengthened late-stage field management.

　　Guangxi planted over 12 million mu of early rice this year. Due to meticulous and scientific management, the seedlings are generally growing well. Consequently, some farmers and cadres have become complacent. In response to this, local Party committees promptly put forward the slogan, "Heads not yet bowing, grain not yet in the granary, it's not a done deal," demanding a final victory in the early rice harvest. Nanning Prefecture recently mobilized 5 million people to inspect over 2.8 million mu of early rice fields, identifying over 700,000 mu of Class III seedlings, which are currently being vigorously fertilized and weeded. In Yulin Prefecture, 160,000 mu of early rice suffering from rice blast are being treated using both traditional and modern methods, with the vast majority turning from yellow to green.

　　This newspaper, Nanjing, 17th – Jiangsu Province’s over 3.4 million mu of early rice have emerged fully and developed early, appearing lush and green. This year, Jiangsu Province's early rice acreage has expanded by over 1 million mu compared to last year, and the quality of transplanting is also better. People's communes are actively applying topdressing fertilizer, irrigating, and weeding to strive for high yields. In Suzhou Prefecture, the 460,000 mu of double-cropping early rice, planted early, have already begun tillering. Various localities began the first weeding and topdressing fertilization work in mid-May.

　　This newspaper, Hefei, 17th – Wuhu Prefecture, Anhui, is launching a “One Liang per Plant” campaign (each rice plant producing one liang of grain) centered on early rice field management.

　　To carry out the "One Liang per Plant" campaign, the Wuhu Prefectural Party Committee requires all localities to widely implement ten measures: ① Vigorously inspect seedlings and replant, ensuring full stands; ② Weed in a timely manner; ③ Apply topdressing fertilizer appropriately and in suitable quantities; ④ Conduct timely "baking the fields" (i.e., draining water and sun-drying the fields); ⑤ Irrigate rationally; ⑥ Make preparations for preventing drought, floods, waterlogging, pests, diseases, and lodging; ⑦ Ensure that experimental fields lead the way, with large areas following up, eliminate Class III seedlings, and strive for overall increased production; ⑧ Establish a field management responsibility system; ⑨ Launch competition and evaluation campaigns; ⑩ Party committees at all levels must strengthen leadership and adhere to putting politics in command.

　　Currently, based on the ten measures proposed by the Prefectural Party Committee regarding strengthening early rice field management, various localities in Wuhu Prefecture have universally convened various meetings and conducted propaganda at all levels for implementation.

    谷不进仓　管理不停
    广西、江苏大力施肥除草防治病害
    芜湖专区展开早稻“棵两”运动
    本报南宁17日电　广西各地批判早稻“定局论”思想以后，普遍加强了后期田间管理。
    广西今年种植早稻一千二百多万亩，由于管理科学细致，禾苗一般生长得好。因此，有部分农民和干部产生了松劲情绪。各地党委针对这种思想情况，及时提出了“穗不勾头、谷不进仓，不算定局”的口号，要求打胜早稻丰收的最后一仗。南宁专区最近出动五百万人从二百八十多万亩早稻田中，查出七十多万亩三类禾，目前正在大力施肥除草。玉林专区十六万亩患稻热病的早稻，采用土法、洋法防治，绝大部分由黄转青。
    本报南京17日电　江苏省三百四十多万亩早稻全苗早发，一片碧绿。今年江苏省早稻面积比去年扩大一百多万亩，栽秧质量也比去年好。各人民公社正积极追肥、灌溉、耘耥，争取高产。苏州专区四十六万多亩双季早稻，栽得早的已开始分蘖。各地在5月中旬就开始了第一次耘耥追肥工作。
    本报合肥17日电　安徽芜湖专区正在开展以早稻田间管理为中心的“棵两”运动（每棵稻产粮一两）。
    中共芜湖地委为开展“棵两”运动，要求各地广泛贯彻执行十项措施：①抓紧进行查苗、补棵，保证全苗；②及时耘草；③适时适量追肥；④及时烤田（即放水晒田）；⑤合理灌溉；⑥做好防旱涝、防洪水、防病虫、防倒伏的准备工作；⑦做到试验田带头，大面积跟上，消灭三类苗，力争全面增产；⑧建立田间管理责任制；⑨开展竞赛、评比运动；⑩各级党委必须加强领导，坚持政治挂帅。
    目前，芜湖专区各地都根据地委提出的关于加强早稻田间管理的十项措施，普遍召开了各种会议，层层进行了宣传，以便贯彻执行。
