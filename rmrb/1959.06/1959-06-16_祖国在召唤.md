Post-Editing Notes:

    The Motherland is Calling
    On the eve of graduation, graduating students from universities and colleges across the country wrote to the Ministry of Education, the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, and other departments, expressing their determination to go to where the motherland needs them and to use their wisdom and hands to build the motherland into a more prosperous, strong, and beautiful nation. This is the bold statement of the youth of the Mao Zedong era.
    Our motherland is so vast and expansive, and the resources of our motherland are so abundant and rich. Whether in the interior or in the border regions, everywhere needs us to develop and build; especially the minority areas and border regions, which need us to work together with our fraternal nationalities to develop and progress together. As the graduates of the Northern Jiangsu Agricultural College said in their letter, we must "make the Great Northwest of the motherland comparable to Suzhou and Hangzhou!"
    Young students of the Mao Zedong era! The motherland is calling, you must be ready to rush to where the motherland needs you at any time! In the socialist construction of the motherland, you must not be afraid of difficulties, not make conditions, and contribute all your strength!

    祖国在召唤
    各地高等学校应届毕业生在毕业前夕，写信给教育部、团中央等部门，表示坚决要到祖国需要的地方去，要用自己的智慧和双手，把祖国建设得更加繁荣、富强和美丽。这是毛泽东时代青年的豪言壮语。
    我们的祖国是多么辽阔广大，我们祖国的物产资源是多么丰足富饶。无论内地或者边疆，到处需要我们去开发、去建设；特别是少数民族地区和边疆，更需要我们去同兄弟民族合力开发，共同进步。正如苏北农学院毕业生信中所说，要“让祖国的大西北和苏杭媲美”！
    毛泽东时代的青年学生们！祖国在召唤，一定要准备随时奔向祖国所需要的地方！要在祖国的社会主义建设中，不怕困难，不讲条件，贡献出自己的全部力量！
