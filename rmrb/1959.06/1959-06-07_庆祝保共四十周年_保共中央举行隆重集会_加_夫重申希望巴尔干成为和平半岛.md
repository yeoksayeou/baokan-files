Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, June 5th. The Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party and the Sofia City Committee held a grand meeting here tonight to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the Bulgarian Communist Party. Leaders of the Bulgarian Communist Party Central Committee and the government, Zhivkov and Yugov, attended the meeting. Ganev, member of the Political Bureau of the Bulgarian Communist Party Central Committee and Secretary of the Central Secretariat, delivered a report at the meeting celebrating the 40th anniversary of the First Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party. He pointed out that Bulgaria fully agrees with Khrushchev's proposal made a few days ago in Tirana to make the Balkans a peninsula of peace without atomic weapons and rocket bases. He said that Bulgaria is an active fighter in bringing the Balkan peoples closer to each other and making the Balkan Peninsula a fortress of peace. So far, the Bulgarian government has taken a series of steps to improve relations with its southern neighbors. Ganev refuted the shameless rumors spread by certain people in power in Greece and Italy that Bulgaria has rocket bases.

In his report, Ganev described in detail the brilliant achievements made by the Bulgarian Communist Party in leading the people of the whole country in the struggle against capitalism and fascism and in the construction of socialism over the past 40 years. He also pointed out that the Bulgarian Communist Party has always maintained its fine traditions of being infinitely loyal to the people and to the principles of proletarian internationalism, and has made great contributions to consolidating and strengthening the unity of the international communist and workers' movement and defending the purity of Marxist-Leninist doctrine.

Ganev said that any conspiracy by imperialists and modern revisionists to undermine the unity of the international communist movement is doomed to failure. The lies of the revisionists can never conceal the faces of traitors, nor can they paralyze the vigilance of the communist army.

The congress announced that the Bulgarian Communist Party Central Committee had received congratulatory telegrams from fraternal parties of twenty-two countries, including the Soviet Union and China.

    庆祝保共四十周年
    保共中央举行隆重集会
    加?夫重申希望巴尔干成为和平半岛
    新华社索非亚5日电　保加利亚共产党中央委员会和索非亚市委员会，今晚在这里举行隆重集会，庆祝保共四十周年。保共中央和政府的领导人日夫科夫和于哥夫等出席了这次集会。保共中央政治局委员、中央书记处书记加?夫在会上作了庆祝保共第一次代表大会四十周年的报告。他指出，保加利亚完全赞同赫鲁晓夫数日前在地拉那提出的关于使巴尔干成为无原子武器和火箭基地的和平半岛的建议。他说，在使巴尔干各国人民互相接近和使巴尔干半岛成为和平堡垒方面，保加利亚是积极的战士。到目前为止，保加利亚政府在改善同南部邻国的关系方面，已经采取了一系列步骤。加?夫驳斥了希腊和意大利的某些当权人物说什么保加利亚有火箭基地的无耻造谣。
    加?夫在报告中详细地叙述了保共四十年来在领导全国人民反对资本主义、法西斯主义的斗争中，在建设社会主义事业中所取得的辉煌成就，并且指出，保共始终无限忠于人民、忠于无产阶级国际主义原则的优良传统，在巩固和加强国际共产主义和工人运动的团结、捍卫马克思列宁主义学说纯洁性方面作出了巨大贡献。
    加?夫说，帝国主义者和现代修正主义者破坏国际共产主义运动团结的任何阴谋，都是枉费心机的。修正主义分子的谎言，绝不能掩盖叛徒的面貌，并且也绝不能麻痹共产主义大军的警惕性。
    大会宣布，保共中央收到了苏联、中国等二十二个国家兄弟党的贺电。
