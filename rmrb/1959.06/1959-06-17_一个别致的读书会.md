    A Unique Reading Club
    Wang Fu
    Some time ago, I attended a reading club for Young Pioneers. The reading club was not large in scale, but it was quite unique. All the participants were teenagers, and they expressed their understanding of the book "Snowflakes Fluttering" in various forms. The meeting was very lively and engaging.
    At the beginning of the reading club, after the little chairman spoke, a little girl with braids walked to the podium and told everyone the story of "Snowflakes Fluttering." When she narrated how Little Baisui became an orphan, the children were deeply moved; when she told how Little Baisui used an iron shovel to kill the Kuomintang's fat soldier and rescued the Eighth Route Army's Old Bian, the atmosphere in the entire venue suddenly became tense, and the children were tightly gripped by her excited voice. Everyone breathed a sigh of relief until Little Baisui was reunited with his father.
    Next, some sang poems in unison, some told comic dialogues, and finally, a costume performance concluded the forum. The plot of this costume performance was the part in the book where Little Baisui saves Old Bian. The young actors were a little nervous when they first came on stage, but they quickly immersed all their emotions in the plot. Although the costumes were rough, and the scenery and props were very simple, they performed very seriously and with feeling. Judging from the realism of the performance, they had a deep understanding of the spirit of the characters in the book.
    The reading club was not long, but the meeting was so rich and interesting, which was a creative activity for the children. This form of reading club can improve children's interest in reading, and also cultivate children's artistic appreciation and artistic expression ability. Children like novelty and are active, and this reading club is suitable for this characteristic of children, tightly combining extracurricular recreational activities and reading. Children's wisdom is abundant, and more novel forms will emerge one after another. May the forms of reading clubs also flourish!

    一个别致的读书会
    王馥
    前些日子，我参加了一个少先队员的读书会。读书会的规模不大，但却很别致。参加会的都是些十几岁的孩子，他们用各种形式表达读“雪花飘飘”这本书的体会。会开得非常生动活泼。
    读书会一开始，小主席讲过话，一个梳辫子的小姑娘走到主席台前，向大家讲述了“雪花飘飘”的故事。当她叙述到小百岁变成孤儿的时候，孩子们深深地感动了；当她讲到小百岁用铁锨砍死国民党的黑胖子兵，救下八路军老边时，全场的空气顿时紧张起来，小朋友们都被她那激动的声音紧紧抓住了。直到小百岁和他的爸爸团聚，大家才松了一口气。
    接着，有的用诗歌联唱，有的说快板，最后，有一个化装表演结束了这个座谈会。这个化装表演的情节就是书中小百岁救老边的那段事儿。小演员们刚上台还有点紧张，但很快就把感情全部沉浸到剧情里了。化装虽粗糙，布景、道具也很简单，可他们演得却很认真、富有感情。从演出的逼真程度看，他们对书中人物的精神是领会很深的。
    这个读书会的时间不算长，但会开的这么丰富有趣，这是孩子们创造性的活动。这种形式的读书会可以提高孩子们读书的兴趣，同时也培养了孩子们的艺术欣赏和艺术表达能力。孩子是喜欢新奇和好动的，这个读书会适合孩子们的这种特点，把课外文娱活动和读书紧紧地结合了起来。孩子们的智慧是丰富的，更新颖的形式一定会层出不穷，愿读书会的形式也百花齐放！
