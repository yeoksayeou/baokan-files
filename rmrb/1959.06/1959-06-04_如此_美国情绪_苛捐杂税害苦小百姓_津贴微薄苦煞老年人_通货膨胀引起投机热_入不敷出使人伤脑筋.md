Foreign Press Digest

    Editor's Note: The May 11th issue of "U.S. News & World Report" published an article titled "The Changing American Mood," a report by the magazine's reporters after traveling across the country, about the general mindset of Americans today. From this article, one can see the empty and distressed state in which ordinary Americans find themselves today.

    A general change is taking place in the current American mood. It's not that people are becoming more concerned about war, recession, or the competition with Russia in controlling space; rather, they are becoming increasingly concerned about personal matters.

    Taxes, debts, how to make ends meet, what to do if the wife loses her job, how to deal with problem children, etc.—these are the personal problems people are most concerned about. Farmers are concerned about the price of pork, small businessmen worry that they are heading for ruin, but the most agonizing thing is taxes. As for world and national events like Russian satellites, American lunar rockets, and the federal budget, one rarely hears them mentioned.

    Most Worried About: "Money"

    When reporters asked people what troubled them most, one after another replied "money" or "how to make ends meet." This is precisely what people of all ages and from all walks of life are agonizing over.

    Wheeler, a taxi driver in San Francisco, said: "Everything follows prices. Even if income increases, rent, food, etc., all rise accordingly, so you don't get any benefit." Stitzinger of Ohio said: "The worst off are the elderly. They have a hard time. Subsidies and old-age assistance, etc., only increase a little bit, but the cost of living keeps rising sharply."

    Rising medicine prices also trouble many people. Pharmacist Antz said: "I hear many people complaining that medicine prices are too expensive. A friend of mine had a heart attack and stayed in the hospital for twenty-one days. The medicine costs alone were $684. It's really unbearable for someone to receive such a bill. Now, a small bottle of ear drops costs $3.75."

    Many people complain that wages cannot keep up with the rising cost of living. To solve this problem, many families have to have the wife go to work or the husband find a second job or "moonlighting" work. A worker in Massachusetts said: "If my wife didn't work, there's no way I could pay the bills."

    Universally Resented: Oppressive Local Taxes

    The sharp rise in local and state taxes is like adding salt to the taxpayer's wound. The reporter found that almost no one doesn't complain about taxes. Pennsylvania's stamp tax was recently increased by 3.5%. A foreman at an auto repair shop said: "Every politician promises to reduce taxes when seeking office, but every politician increases taxes after taking office."

    People complain that there seems to be no end to tax increases.

    Is a "Speculative Fever" Sweeping the Country?

    A bookstore owner in San Francisco said: "We've sold hundreds and thousands of books like 'Shortcuts to Getting Rich.' It seems like a 'speculative fever' has emerged, but people aren't gambling recklessly."

    The manager of the First National Bank of Hamilton, Ohio, warned people to be aware of a real danger. He said: "Some people are simply obsessed with securities." A manager of a chemical plant said: "Many of those involved in securities trading are small businessmen. They've emptied all the capital in their businesses to trade securities, and sometimes it even includes other people's money."

    Rully, the owner of a Wall Street company, said: "The current stock market, in terms of the number of buyers, is the largest stock market in the history of Wall Street in America."

    Market analyst White said: "The mood on Wall Street today reflects a mindset that people increasingly believe that inflation has become an unstoppable force in the national economy." A bank vice president said: "Inflation is undoubtedly the most important problem in America. It is a very real threat. There have been periods of prolonged price increases in history, but never has there been a precedent of accepting inflation as an inevitable thing like this."

    Many bosses on Wall Street are showing interest in foreign securities. A research expert at a large exchange said:
  "American securities prices may have become too high, to the point of losing most of their investment benefits. Therefore, it is very likely that a lot of capital will flow abroad for risky ventures."

    "Live More Comfortably":—Through Borrowing

    Relying on debt to buy furniture and appliances remains the way of life for most Americans.

    A banker said: "People are buying washing machines, televisions, cars, and other things on credit, and I don't know how they will ever pay off these debts in their lifetime."

    A doctor said that many of his patients' ailments are caused by money problems. He said: "A person buys a car and has to drag it out for thirty months to pay off the car price, and of course, that's going to cause a long-term illness." In the areas where people are threatened by unemployment, they are more careful to avoid debt.

    Growing Dissatisfaction with "Superficiality"

    Generally speaking, taxpayers don't care too much about spending money on schools. However, people are increasingly dissatisfied with the schools' emphasis on appearance rather than practical education. A worker said: "My poor child hasn't learned anything. He's not a genius, but if he were taught something, he would be able to learn it." A farmer complained: "My child knows everything about space and who built the pyramids, but he can't even figure out two plus two."

    Federal Spending, Space, etc., "Let Washington Worry About It"

    Taxpayers are not interested in those national affairs. People do have a lot of opinions about foreign aid. One person said: "Friendship cannot be bought with money. I never believe in foreign aid." A businessman in Ohio said: "Nine out of ten people here would prefer to see the taxes they pay used domestically rather than abroad." People are not interested in satellites. Someone said: "Can't we stop worrying about those moons and stars and use the money on people who are starving and sick?"

    "Problems with Children are Because..."

    A teacher in San Francisco said: "I feel that parents don't care enough about their children. This may be because many mothers have to go out to work. Everyone wants a new car and a new refrigerator, so they go looking for things to do, and the children often wander around outside unattended." A farmer in Pennsylvania said: "People think about money too much. They don't have time to live with their children."

### 如此“美国情绪”  苛捐杂税害苦小百姓　津贴微薄苦煞老年人  通货膨胀引起投机热　入不敷出使人伤脑筋

专栏：外论摘要

    如此“美国情绪”
    苛捐杂税害苦小百姓　津贴微薄苦煞老年人
    通货膨胀引起投机热　入不敷出使人伤脑筋
    编者按：5月11日的“美国新闻与世界报道”以“改变中的美国情绪”为题发表了一篇文章，是该杂志记者在旅行全国后所写的关于美国人目前的普遍的思想情况的报道。从这篇文章中可以看出普通美国人今天是处于怎样一种空虚、苦闷的状态。
    目前美国情绪正在发生一种普遍的变化。并不是人们正在变得关心战争、衰退或者同俄国之间在控制空间方面的竞争，而是人们变得愈来愈关心个人的事情。
    税收、债款、如何使自己入能敷出、如果妻子失了业怎么办、如何处理问题儿童等等，这些是人们最关心的个人问题。农民们关心的是猪肉的价格，小商人则担心着自己正在走向穷途末路，但是最令人焦心的是税收。至于俄国的人造卫星和美国的月球火箭以及联邦预算等等世界和国家大事，是很少听到有人谈起的。
    最操心的是：“钱”
    当记者向人们问起他最伤脑筋的事情是什么的时候，人们一个接着一个回答说“钱”，或者“如何入能敷出”，这正是各阶层的老老少少正在伤脑筋的事情。
    旧金山的出租汽车司机惠勒说：“什么事都跟着价格走，即使收入增加了，可是房租、饭钱等等都跟着上涨，结果什么好处也捞不着。”俄亥俄州的斯蒂辛格说：“最惨的是老年人，他们的日子很难熬，津贴和老年补助金等等才增加那么一点点，可是生活费用却一股劲地往上涨。”
    医药价格上升也是使许多人伤脑筋的事情，药剂师安茨说：“我听到许多人抱怨药价太贵。我的一个朋友得了心脏病在医院里住了二十一天，单单药费他们就要了他六百八十四美元，一个人接到这样一张账单真正吃不消。现在一小瓶耳朵药水就要三元七角五。”
    许多人抱怨说，工资跟不上生活费用的上升。许多家庭为了解决这个问题只能让妻子出去工作或者由丈夫再找一个第二职业或“月光下的”工作。马萨诸塞州的一个工人说：“如果我妻子不工作的话，鬼才付得起账单。”
    人所共怨的是：地方税收逼人
    地方和州的赋税的急骤上升好比是在付税人的伤口上加上一把盐。记者发现几乎没有人不抱怨赋税。宾夕法尼亚州的印花税不久前又提高了3.5％。一个汽车修配厂的领班说：“每一个政治家在谋取职位时总是答应要减低税收，可是每一个政治家职位到手以后却是增加税收。”
    人们抱怨说，税收的增加简直看不见一个尽头。
    是不是掀起了“投机热”？
    旧金山的一个书店老板说：“我们卖出了成百成千本的‘致富捷径’之类的书。看来就像出现了‘投机热’，但是人们倒也不是不顾一切的进行赌博。”
    俄亥俄州汉密尔顿第一国民银行的经理警告人们注意一种真正的危险。他说：“有些人简直对证券如痴如狂。”一个化学工厂的经理说：“搞证券交易的很多是小商人，他们提空了自己企业里所有的资本来作证券交易，有时候其中还有别人的钱。”
    华尔街的一家公司老板鲁利说：“目前的证券市场从买主的人数来说是美国华尔街有史以来的最大的证券市场。”
    市场分析员怀特说：“华尔街今天的情绪反映了一种思想情况，那就是，人们日益相信通货膨胀已经成了国民经济中的一个不可遏止的力量。”一个银行副经理说：“通货膨胀无疑是美国最重要的问题。这是一个非常实在的威胁。历史上有过物价长时期上涨的现象，但是从来没有像这样把通货膨胀作为一件不可避免的事情而接受的前例。”
    华尔街的许多老板对外国证券表示兴趣。某一个大交易所内的一个调查专家说：
  “美国的证券价格可能变得太高，以至于可能丧失大部分投资利益。因此，很可能有许多资金将流往国外进行冒险事业。”
    “生活得舒服些”：——靠借债
    靠借债买家具用品仍旧是大多数美国人的生活方式。
    一个银行家说：“人们借着债大买特买洗衣机、电视机和汽车等等东西，我不知道他们在世之日如何付得清这笔账。”
    某一个医生说，他的许多病人的病痛是金钱问题造成的。他说：“一个人买了一辆汽车，要拖上三十个月才付得清车价，那当然要害长期病了。”而在那些在失业威胁下的人们的居住区里，人们却比较小心的避免借债。
    人们对“浮华”日益不满
    一般说来，付税人对花钱在学校上是不怎么计较的。但是人们对于学校的只讲究外表而不讲究实际的教育日益感到不满。一个工人说：“我那可怜的孩子什么也没有学到。他不是天才，但是如果教他一些东西的话，他是能够学的。”一个农民抱怨说：“我的孩子对于空间和金字塔是谁造的一应尽知，但是他甚至连二加二都弄不清。”
    联邦开支、空间等等，“让华盛顿去伤脑筋吧”
    纳税人对于那些国家大事是没有兴趣的。人们对对外援助却很有意见。有一个人说：“友谊是不能用钱买的，我从来不相信对外援助。”俄亥俄州的一个商人说：“我们这里十有九个都情愿看到自己所付的税用在国内而不要用在外国。”人们对于人造卫星不感兴趣。有人说：“能不能不去管那些月亮星星，而把这些钱用在挨饿害病的人的身上呢？”
    “孩子发生问题是因为……”
    旧金山的一个教师说：“我觉得父母们不够关心孩子。这可能是因为许多母亲都要出去工作。每个人都想要新汽车新冰箱，所以就去找事情作，儿童们往往因而游荡在外无人照看”。宾夕法尼亚州一个农民说：“人们想钱想得太厉害了，他们没有时间同自己的孩子一起生活生活。”
