    Bamboo Flowering
    Bei Yuan
    Recently, in Zhuji and other places in Zhejiang, the phenomenon of bamboo flowering and bamboo rice bearing has occurred, which has surprised people. Few people have seen bamboo flowering, and bamboo flowering is often considered an "ominous sign" because after the bamboo forest blooms, it often suffers a complete wipeout, with all the bamboo dying.
    In fact, this is not an ominous sign, but a one-time fruiting phenomenon. For example, wheat, rice, and other annual plants die after flowering and bearing fruit, which is a very natural phenomenon.
    Most perennial plants are multiple fruiters. After peach trees grow up, they bloom every spring, and roses bloom several times a year. However, there are also a few perennial plants that do not bloom every year, but only once.
    In India, there is a kind of palm tree that lives for thirty or forty years and is more than six zhang tall, but it remains silent and never blooms. Until the end, it finally erupts like a volcano, shooting out a large inflorescence that is more than four zhang long and more than three zhang in diameter, with 100,000 flowers on it, and then it dies.
    In the Americas, there is a kind of agave. According to the locals, it can live for hundreds of years and is never seen to bloom. Finally, it concentrates all its nutrients and draws out a flower axis that is more than six zhang high, blooming with 1.5 million flowers, thus ending its life.
    Bamboo is also mostly a one-time fruiter. Because bamboo relies on underground stems—bamboo whips—to reproduce, what looks like a bamboo forest is actually only composed of a few bamboo plants. Once it blooms, it all blooms, regardless of age. Generally, before flowering, the bamboo leaves turn yellow, and flower buds grow at the ends of the branches; after flowering and bearing fruit, the leaves fall off, the stems become brittle, and slowly they all wither and die.

    竹子开花
    北远
    最近浙江诸暨等地发生了竹子开花结竹米的现象，人们都感到奇怪。很少有人见过竹子开花，而竹子开花也常被人们认为是“不祥之兆”。因为竹林开花后，往往就全军复没，统统死光。
    其实这并不是什么不祥之兆，而是一种一次结实现象。例如小麦、水稻等一年生植物，开花结实后便死去，是一种很自然的现象。
    多年生植物，绝大多数是多次结实的。桃树长大后，每年春天都要盛开一阵，月季花一年中要开好几次。但也有少数多年生植物不是每年都开花，而是只开一次的。
    在印度有种棕榈树，活了三、四十岁，个子有六丈多高，但一直保持沉默，从不开花，直到最后，终于火山爆发似的射出一枝长达四丈多，直径三丈多的大花序，上面有花十万朵，然后就死去了。
    在美洲有一种龙舌兰，据当地人说，可以活到几百年，从不见开花，最后集中全部养料，抽出一枝六丈多高的花轴，盛开着一百五十万朵花，就此结束了一生。
    竹子也大都是一次结实，因竹是靠地下茎——竹鞭来繁殖的，所以看上去是一丛竹林，实际上只是几棵竹子所组成。一旦开花，就不管老幼全部开放。一般在开花前，竹叶发黄，枝端长出花芽；开花结实后，叶子就脱落，茎杆变脆，慢慢就全部枯死。
