Going to the Countryside to See the Bumper Harvest
By Our Correspondents Wu Gang and Xue Yonglin

    In Bacun Production Team of Chengguan Commune, Pucheng County, Weibei Dryland, Shaanxi Province, with the help of the commune, after heavy and intense labor, they finally managed to cut down and transport the bumper wheat harvest.
    On the evening of May 31st, as soon as the reporters arrived at Bacun, Yuan Cunhong, a 73-year-old man, pulled the reporters to see the wheat that had been cut down the day before. He pointed to piles of wheat lying on the ground and said, "Look, how beautifully these eight mu of wheat have grown! The shock brigade of eight young men worked all day and only cut down a little over six mu. The next day, the young men's arms and legs were stiff." He blinked his eyes and said in surprise, "I've lived such a long life and never seen such good wheat!"
    In the southwest corner of Bacun, the Fourth Production Team was harvesting wheat. This plot of land totaled one hundred and twenty-five mu. The wheat grew really well, as tall as a person's chest, row after row, plant next to plant, all uniform, with thick stalks and large ears. Team leader Li Tianzuo told reporters that this year's wheat harvest was very different from last year's: last year this plot of wheat was also good, but this year it was one-third taller in addition to being denser; last year, a stack was placed after cutting a long stretch, but this year a stack was placed with a mere twist of the hips; last year the knife was sharpened every few rounds of cutting, but this year the knife had to be sharpened after going through a seven-fen-long section; last year a large cart could pull five mu of this land, but this year two large carts took a whole day plus half a night to pull twenty-one carts, which was still less than twenty mu of wheat.
    Two days after the wheat harvest began, problems arose. It was difficult to cut, the cut wheat could not be transported back, the threshing grounds were small, and the warehouses and mat enclosures were not enough. Bacun, located on the Weibei Plateau, has always been a low-yield area. The best wheat harvest was in 1956, with a yield of only one hundred and eighty-four jin per mu. People had experience with low yields, but no experience with such high yields. Under that low-yield situation, although the Bacun Production Team had more land, fewer people, and less animal power, it could still complete the harvesting, transportation, and threshing in a timely manner. This year's situation was different. Although they mobilized all the men, women, old and young in the team before the summer harvest, organized four shock brigades, expanded the threshing grounds from forty mu last year to more than sixty mu, and expanded the warehouses from more than thirty rooms in the past to more than seventy rooms... but after two days of harvesting, these original plans fell far behind the actual situation and had to be re-examined.
    Wang Lanying, secretary of the Bacun Production Team Party branch, Wang Zhongyi, the team leader, and the cadres of each team have been staying up all night in recent days, studying how to get the bumper wheat harvest back. According to their calculations, the entire village has three hundred and thirty-five full and semi-laborers. After deducting those who transport and thresh, each person can cut two mu per day, and it will take more than ten days to cut two thousand nine hundred mu of wheat; the entire village has seventeen large carts, and one hundred and seventy large carts can be pulled in one day, which is only a little more than one hundred and seventy mu, and it will take half a month to transport; the wheat cannot be piled up in the threshing ground after being transported back, and there are not enough warehouses and bags for threshing. What to do? Finally, they decided that, in addition to the large carts changing people and animals without stopping, they would mobilize manpower to cut wheat during the day and transport it at night, and add nine more field threshing grounds (a total of forty-five mu); they would pay the full year's public grain and sell the purchased grain in one season, which could reduce seven warehouses; in addition, they would borrow another thousand hemp bags to solve the problem.
    This situation was discovered by the commune, and the entire commune extended a helping hand to them. The commune transferred the state organ cadres who came to support and the members of the Lingao Commune and the Dongyang Management Area. The large carts of the Chengguan, Jiaqu, and Xiangcun Management Areas were also transferred. With the help of three hundred and twenty-eight people and more than thirty large carts, it took two days to cut and three days to transport to basically complete the harvesting and transportation tasks.

    下乡看丰收
    本报记者　吴钢　薛永林
    陕西渭北旱原蒲城县城关公社八福村生产队，在公社的帮助下，经过繁重而紧张的劳动，总算把丰收的小麦割倒、运回来了。
    5月31日傍晚，当记者一到八福村，七十三岁的元存宏老汉就拉着记者，去看昨天割倒的小麦。他指着满地放着的一堆堆麦子说：“看，这八亩麦长得多美！突击队八个年轻小伙子干了一整天，才割了六亩多。第二天，小伙子们胳膊腿都硬了。”他眨了眨眼吃惊地说下去：“我活了这么大年纪，没见过这样好的小麦呵！”
    在八福村的西南角，第四生产小队正在那里割麦。这块地共有一百二十五亩。小麦长得真好，齐胸高，一行接一行，一株靠一株，齐臻臻地，秆子粗，穗子大。队长李天佐告诉记者，今年割麦和去年大有不同：去年这块小麦也不错，今年除了密还比去年高三分之一；去年割很长一段才放一堆，今年屁股一拧就一堆；去年割几个来回磨一次刀，今年七分长的地段，一趟过去就得磨刀；去年这块地一大车能拉五亩，今年两个大车整整一天加上半夜，才拉了二十一车，还不到二十亩小麦。
    小麦收割两天之后，问题都来了。割不动，割下的拉运不回，场面小，仓库、席囤都不够用。处在渭北高原的八福村，向来是低产区，小麦收成最好的1956年，亩产才是一百八十四斤。人们有低产的经验，从没有像这样高产的经验。在那种低产的情况下，虽然八福村生产队地多、人少、畜力少，仍然可以及时收割、运输和碾打完毕。今年的情况可不同了。尽管他们夏收前动员了全队男女老少，组织了四个突击队，把场面由去年的四十亩扩大到六十多亩，把仓库由过去的三十多间房子扩大到七十多间……但是在收割过两天之后，这些原来的计划，远远落在实际状况的后面了，必须重新研究。
    八福村生产队党支部书记王兰英，队长王忠义和各小队的干部连日来彻夜不眠，研究怎样把丰收的小麦拿回来。按照他们计算，全村共有男女全半劳动力三百三十五人，除去运输、打场的人，一人一天割二亩，二千九百亩麦子得十多天；全村共有十七个大车，一天拉一百七十大车，才是一百七十多亩，拉运就要半个月；运回来场里堆不下，打出来仓库、口袋都不够用。怎么办？最后，他们决定，除大车换人换畜不停车外，动员人力白天割麦，夜晚突击运输，再增加九个（共四十五亩大）田间场面；一季交清全年的公粮，卖完征购粮，这样可以减少七个仓库；另外，再借一千条麻袋，才能解决问题。
    这种情况被公社发觉了，全社就向他们伸出了支援之手。公社把前来支援的国家机关干部和林皋公社社员、东阳管理区社员都调来了，城关、贾曲和翔村管理区的大车也调来了。在三百二十八个人和三十多辆大车的帮助下，割了两天，运了三天，才基本上完成了收、运任务。
