    Leaders Attend Classes to Observe, Teachers Strengthen Research
    Xinshi Road Primary School Focuses on Improving Teaching Quality
    Xinhua News Agency News: Currently, improving the quality of primary school education is an important topic. Xinshi Road Primary School in Anqing City, Anhui Province, has made many efforts in this regard this semester. They are focusing on teaching and fully utilizing the guiding role of teachers.
    This semester, the principal, the director of teaching, and other leaders of Xinshi Road Primary School have gone into the classrooms to understand the teaching situation; they frequently attend classes to observe and participate in teaching and research group activities. In teaching, teachers with teaching experience and those who are less experienced are appropriately paired to have the experienced teachers guide the new ones, comprehensively improving the quality of teaching. They also organize teachers of the same grade and subject to exchange teaching experiences, conduct demonstration teaching and observation teaching activities. The primary school leadership not only values the deployment and arrangement of teaching work but also conscientiously grasps supervision and inspection, such as checking the implementation of teaching work plans, teachers' lesson preparation notes, and student workbooks.
    The teachers have strengthened their teaching preparation and research. First of all, in digesting the teaching materials and in classroom teaching, they pay attention to starting from the actual level of the students, considering the students' ability to accept the teaching materials in every aspect, and explaining the materials from the shallow to the deep and from the easy to the difficult. Secondly, for the difficult points of the teaching materials, they repeatedly explain them in detail, and assign homework requiring students to practice the same problem several times. The teacher's concise explanation is combined with students' reading aloud of the text and answering questions. This not only gives full play to the teacher's guiding role in teaching but also cultivates students' independent thinking ability. In addition, teachers also pay attention to mastering the relationship between the teaching materials, strengthening the summary and induction of explanations, and helping students to continuously review and consolidate existing knowledge during teaching.

    领导随堂听课　教师加强研究
    新市路小学大抓教学质量
    新华社讯　当前提高小学教育的质量是一个重要的课题，安徽省安庆市新市路小学本学期以来在这方面作了很多努力，他们狠狠抓教学，充分发挥教师的主导作用。
    这学期，新市路小学的校长、教导主任等人，都分别深入班级了解教学情况；经常到课堂听课，参加教研组活动。在教学中把有教学经验的和业务比较生疏的教师适当搭配，以老带新，全面地提高教学质量；并组织同年级同科目的教师相互交流教学经验，开展示范教学和观摩教学等活动。小学领导上不仅重视教学工作的布置、安排，同时能认真地抓紧督促检查，如检查教学工作计划的执行情况，教师的备课笔记和学生作业簿等。
    教师们加强了教学准备和教学研究。首先，在消化教材和课堂教学中，注意从学生的实际水平出发，处处考虑到学生对教材的接受能力，由浅入深、由易到难地讲解教材。其次，对于教材的难点，反复细述，布置作业时把同样的问题叫学生多练习几次。教师的精讲和学生朗读课文、回答问题是结合进行的，这样一面发挥了教师在教学上的主导作用，同时又培养了学生的独立思考能力。另外，教师在教学时还注意掌握教材相互间的联系，加强讲解的总结归纳，帮助学生不断复习，巩固已有的知识。
