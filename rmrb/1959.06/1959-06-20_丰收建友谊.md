Building Friendship Through a Bumper Harvest
By Our Correspondent Wang Kongcheng

The 1.4 million mu of wheat in the suburbs of the capital have ripened. In the rolling golden wheat sea, everywhere is filled with the harvesting army, a hubbub of voices, and the roar of motors. As of the 16th, more than 1.1 million mu of wheat fields in the suburbs have been harvested.

Workers, barely having taken off their work clothes, come to the countryside in organized teams. As soon as the workers from the Beijing People's Printing Factory arrived at their destination—the Zhao Village Store production team in the southern suburbs, where they had previously worked—they asked the production team leader to assign them tasks. The team leader brought a bundle of sickles, and everyone wondered, "If we're not pulling the wheat, why do we need sickles?" Cao Bingzhang, the branch secretary of the brigade, said with a smile, "This year is different from previous years. The wheat is thick, tall, and dense. If you don't cut it, how can you pull it?" The workers were overjoyed. Each sickle in their hands was like a sharp sword, quickly plunged into the heart of the wheat field, leaving high stacks of wheat behind them. Cao Bingzhang said gratefully to everyone, "This wheat was watered by the canals you helped dig! Look how well it has grown. One ear of wheat has seventy or eighty grains, whereas in the past, it had at most thirty or forty grains." Everyone was busy harvesting when suddenly a drizzle began. But the workers were even more spirited. Some even shouted, "Hurry up! Seize the cool weather to rush the harvest!"

The troops stationed in Beijing who are supporting the wheat harvest are the most active shock force. If they weren't wearing uniforms, how could you distinguish them from the farmers! Beside the high-yield wheat field of the Liu Hulan Team of the Yushu Village Production Team in Fengtai, more than two hundred officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army were taking a water break, large drops of sweat falling from their tanned faces. In order to do more work, they had arrived here at four o'clock in the morning to start their shift. Now, while wiping their sweat, they listened to Qi Hongming, the secretary of the Communist Youth League branch of the production team, describe the process of cultivating this experimental field: In winter, the team members braved the cold, carrying buckets from door to door to collect urine fertilizer; when irrigating the wheat, they fought almost day and night in shifts. The soldiers expressed great joy and admiration. They expressed that they would not only cut quickly, but also try their best not to lose a single grain.

The fields of plenty are filled with joy everywhere. Students from the Department of Oriental Languages of Peking University, who participated in the wheat harvest in Songzhuang Commune in Tongzhou, performed various cultural programs for the farmers during their breaks: songs, dances, clapper talks, Shandong allegro.... More than two thousand students from Peking University have participated in the wheat harvest for several days. They work happily during labor and help the villagers carry water after work; the villagers also treat them with special enthusiasm.

The cadres of the organizations who participated in the wheat harvest in the Sino-German People's Friendship Commune in the eastern suburbs are inspecting the wheat with the farmers in the threshing ground. The threshing machine rumbles loudly, and people anxiously wait for the inspection results. (Attached picture)
The Bafu Direct Team of the Agricultural Machinery Administration Bureau of Pucheng County, Shaanxi Province, actively participated in the summer harvest battle of the local people's commune production teams. This is them using a combine harvester (made by Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory in 1958) to thresh wheat for the Bafu Production Team in the field.

    丰收建友谊
    本报记者　王孔诚
    首都郊区的一百四十万亩小麦成熟了，在翻滚着的金黄色麦海里，到处是收麦大军，人声鼎沸，马达轰隆。截至16日，郊区麦田已经收割了一百一十多万亩。
    才脱去了工作服的工人，整队整队的来到农村。北京人民印刷厂的工人一到达目的地——他们曾经劳动过的南郊赵村店生产队，就要求生产队长分配任务。生产队的组长抱来一抱镰刀，大家稀罕地说：“不是拔麦子，要镰刀干吗？”大队支部书记曹柄章笑着说：“今年和往年不一样了，麦子又粗又高又密，不割，哪里拔得动？”工人们乐开了怀，每个人手上的镰刀都像利剑一般地迅速插往麦田中心，身后留下高高的麦堆。曹柄章感激地对大家说：“这麦子是用你们帮忙挖的水渠里的水浇的！你们看这麦子长的多好，一个麦穗有七八十粒，过去最多有三四十粒。”大家正忙着收割，忽然下了一阵细雨。可是工人们精神更加抖擞，有人还喊：“快干！趁凉快抢收啊！”
    支援麦收的驻京部队，是一支最活跃的突击力量。如果他们不是穿着军装，又怎能辨别他们和农民之间的区别呢！在丰台榆树庄生产队刘胡兰小队小麦丰产田畔，二百多名解放军官兵正在喝水休息，大滴的汗水由他们的晒黑了的脸上落下。他们为了多干活，早上四点就赶到这里上工了。现在，他们一边擦汗，一边听着生产队团总支书记齐鸿鸣介绍培育这块试验田的经过：冬天，队员们冒着寒冷，抬着桶，挨门挨户去收集尿肥；浇小麦灌浆水时，几乎是日夜轮番战斗。战士们表示了极大的喜悦和敬佩。他们表示不光割得快，而且尽量作到不丢掉一颗粮食。
    丰收的田野上到处一片欢乐。在通州宋庄公社参加麦收的北京大学东语系学生，休息时给农民演出了各种文艺节目：歌舞、快板、山东快书……。北京大学的二千多名学生已经参加麦收好几天了，他们劳动时干得欢，下工后还帮老乡挑水；老乡们也特别热情地招待他们。
    在东郊中德人民友好公社参加麦收的机关干部们，正在场院里和农民一起验收小麦。脱粒机车轰隆地响着，人们焦急地等待着验收结果。（附图片）
