　　Such Cooperation

　　The drums of the Atlantic Conference have been beating in London for several days. Speakers seem to be praising the so-called "unity" and "cooperation" of the North Atlantic group. But a few days ago, a speech by an American military theorist explained what kind of "cooperation" the United States hopes for.

　　Henry Kissinger, an advisor to the U.S. State Department and the Department of Defense, said at the conference: "No matter how solid the alliance is, the situation requiring suicide to defend foreign territories may become increasingly daunting." He also bluntly pointed out: If a war breaks out in Europe, "don't expect the United States to fully commit to the war."

　　Hasn't the United States always styled itself as the "defender" of the so-called "free world"? Why is it now "daunted" by such a "heavy responsibility"? It turns out that this is just a word of intimidation. Kissinger's real intention is to advise Western European countries to "establish a strong military force on the continent" to deal with the Soviet Union. In other words, they should arm themselves quickly and act as the vanguard in the future wars of aggression launched by the United States.

　　Unwilling to bear obligations for Western Europe, but wanting Western Europe to risk their lives for it. This is the "unity" and "cooperation" understood and needed by the United States!

    如此合作
    大西洋大会的锣鼓已经在伦敦敲了几天。发言者似乎都要对所谓北大西洋集团的“团结”和“合作”颂扬一番。但是前几天一位美国军事理论家的发言却说明，原来美国所希望的“合作”究竟是什么。
    美国国务院和国防部的顾问亨利·基辛格在会上说：“不管联盟的团结多么巩固，但是为保卫外国领土而需要自杀的情况，可能越来越令人望而生畏”。他并且直截了当地指出：如果欧洲发生战争，“不要指望美国完全投入战争”。
    美国不是一向以所谓“自由世界”的“保卫者”自居的吗？为什么现在要对这样的“重任”“望而生畏”了呢？原来这只是一种恫吓之词。基辛格的真正意思是要劝西欧国家在“大陆上建立一支有实力的军事力量”来对付苏联。换句话说，它们应该赶紧武装起来，以在美国将来发动的侵略战争中打头阵。
    自己不愿为西欧承担义务，却又要西欧来为它自己卖命。这就是美国所理解和所需要的“团结”与“合作”！
