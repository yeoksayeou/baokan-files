    Metrology Work Cannot Be Ignored
    Consciously grasping metrology work in the movement to increase production and practice economy will greatly promote the improvement of technical management, ensure product quality, and increase labor productivity.
    Metrology work is like the "eyes" of industry. It can guarantee the accuracy and consistency of measuring instruments and their correct use. Without the necessary measuring instruments, such as gauges and inspection tools, the specifications of products and parts will lose their standards. As the saying goes, "Without rules, there can be no circles or squares." Production cannot be separated from measurement, and measurement serves production. If metrology work is not done well and measuring instruments are inaccurate, production will lack a basis, and quality cannot be guaranteed.
    In recent years, the machinery industry in various regions has developed greatly, but metrology work is still a relatively weak link in some enterprises. Some factories and enterprises lack the necessary gauges in production. Even if they have gauges, they cannot guarantee the accuracy of these gauges because they have not established metrology work. Some employees in production only rely on their eyes, ears, and old experience, and do not pay attention to using gauges, so it is difficult for products to meet standards. We know that there are many factors affecting product quality in machinery industry production, but metrology is an important one. If measuring instruments are out of calibration, have not been verified for a long time, or are managed chaotically, and are not used correctly or well maintained, and if there are no professional metrology institutions or personnel responsible for metrology work, it will inevitably lead to inconsistent part sizes that fail to meet the requirements of the drawings.
    The National Metrology Work Experience Exchange Conference summarized and exchanged many experiences. We hope that all regions will use these experiences to do a good job in metrology and promote high-quality and high-yield production.

### 计量工作不能忽视

    计量工作不能忽视
    在增产节约运动中，有意识地把计量工作抓起来，对于提高技术管理水平，保证产品质量提高劳动生产率会有很大的促进作用。
    计量工作，好比工业的“眼睛”，它可以保证计量器具的准确一致和正确使用。没有必要的计量器具，如量具、检具等，产品和零件的规格就失去准绳。俗话说：“不以规矩，不能成方圆”。生产离不开计量，计量是为生产服务的。计量工作没有搞好，计量器具不准，生产就没有依据，质量也就得不到保证。
    近几年来，各地机械工业有了很大的发展，而计量工作在某些企业中还是比较薄弱的一环。有的工厂企业在进行生产中，缺乏必要的量具，即使有量具又因为没有建立计量工作，不能保证这些量具的准确性。有些职工在生产中只凭眼睛看、耳朵听和老经验，不注意运用量具，因而产品就很难达到标准。我们知道：机械工业生产中影响产品质量的因素很多，但是计量是其中的一个重要因素。计量器具失准，长期没有校验，或者管理混乱，使用时又没有正确的方法和很好的维护和保养，没有专业的计量机构或专责人员管计量工作，就必然使零件尺寸不一，不能达到图纸的要求。
    全国计量工作经验交流会议总结和交流了不少的经验，愿各地运用这些经验，做好计量工作，促进优质高产。
