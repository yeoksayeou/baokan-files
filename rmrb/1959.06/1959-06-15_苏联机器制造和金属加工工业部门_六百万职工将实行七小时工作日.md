    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 13th: According to the "Soviet Russia" newspaper, six million employees in the Soviet machine building and metal processing industries will gradually transition to a seven-hour workday system starting from October this year. This work will be fully completed within the coming year.
    Machine building and metal processing industry is the department with the largest number of employees in the Soviet national economy. More than one-third of the total number of industrial employees in the country, about half of the engineering and technical personnel, and about 30% of the staff work in this department.
    Shortening the workday is an important measure taken by the Soviet Union to improve the people's livelihood. Reducing one hour per day for six million people is equivalent to each person gaining more than thirty days of extra rest time throughout the year. Previously, Soviet coal miners had already transitioned to a seven-hour workday.
    In order to make full preparations, dozens of machine building factories had already piloted the seven-hour work system last year. In these factories, although the working hours were shortened, the output not only did not decrease but increased due to the workers' creative initiative.

    六百万职工将实行七小时工作日
    新华社莫斯科13日电　据“苏维埃俄罗斯报”报道，苏联机器制造和金属加工工业部门的六百万职工，将从今年10月起开始逐步过渡到实行七小时工作日的制度。这一工作将在明年年内全部完成。
    机器制造和金属加工工业是苏联国民经济中职工人数最多的一个部门。在全国工业职工总数中，有三分之一以上的工人、约一半的工程技术人员和30％左右的职工在这个部门工作。
    缩短工作日是苏联改善人民生活的一项重要措施。六百万人员每天减少一小时，就等于全年每人获得了三十多天的额外休息时间。在此以前，苏联煤矿工人已过渡到七小时工作日。
    为了进行充分的准备，有几十家机器制造厂早在去年就试行了七小时工作制。在这些工厂中，虽然缩短了工作时间，但由于职工创造积极性的发挥，产量不仅没有减少，反而增加了。
