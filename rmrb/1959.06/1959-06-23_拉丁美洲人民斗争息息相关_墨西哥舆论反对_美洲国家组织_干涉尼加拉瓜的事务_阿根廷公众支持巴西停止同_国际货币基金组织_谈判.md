Xinhua News Agency, June 22nd: Mexico City Dispatch: Mexican officials and public opinion oppose the Organization of American States' interference in the anti-dictatorial struggle of the Nicaraguan people.

	According to Mexico's "Ultimas Noticias," Mexican Foreign Minister Manuel Tello, when recently meeting with reporters to discuss the Organization of American States' interference in Nicaragua, said that Mexico's position is based on the fundamental principles of its foreign policy. The foremost of these is the principle of non-intervention, because Mexico believes that no country has the right to interfere in the internal affairs of another. Without a doubt, the Organization of American States should also not interfere in the internal affairs of its member states.

	Mexico's "El Informador" published an article criticizing the Organization of American States' interference in the internal affairs of Latin American countries, threatening the freedom and independence of these countries.

	The article pointed out that the Organization of American States is sending representatives to Nicaragua to collect intelligence on the nature of the uprising taking place in that country. Nicaragua is undergoing an internal revolution, the aim of which is to overthrow a government that does not serve the interests of the people. The Mexican representative pointed out during the Organization of American States' discussion of this issue that the Organization of American States' interference in Nicaragua sets a dangerous precedent. Such events by the Organization of American States could turn it into a tool for suppressing the will of the people.

	"El Informador" concluded by writing that governments that are not supported by their own people always attempt to turn internal problems into international ones, and then appeal to international organizations, and, if successful, to foreign forces that are concerned with maintaining the status quo.

Xinhua News Agency, June 22nd: Buenos Aires Dispatch: Argentine public opinion praises and supports the Brazilian government's recent announcement of suspending loan negotiations with the U.S.-controlled International Monetary Fund.

	The Argentine "Sixty-Two Unions" Steering Committee issued a statement congratulating Brazil for rejecting the shameful conditions attached to the International Monetary Fund's "assistance" to Brazil's finances. The statement said that the Brazilian people will undoubtedly go all out to ensure that Brazil does not mortgage its sovereignty and lose its national dignity. The statement also pointed out that because the Brazilian president has refused to conduct loan negotiations with the International Monetary Fund, the Brazilian people should be proud of their president's actions.

	Argentina's "Razón" pointed out that this event has caused widespread discussion in Santiago, Buenos Aires, and other countries that require assistance from the International Monetary Fund. The newspaper commented that the International Monetary Fund has not been able to "get its way" when dealing with some South American governments, because they are convinced that accepting the conditions of the International Monetary Fund means allowing foreigners to control their country's finances.

	The commentary emphasized that this is the situation in Argentina after accepting the so-called "economic stabilization plan" proposed by the International Monetary Fund: "If the International Monetary Fund's opinions are not respected, the organization will not provide a single penny."

	"Razón," in condemning the so-called loan conditions of the International Monetary Fund, said, "Being told by others how to use bank loans, what should be imported, and what should not be imported, is something that everyone disagrees with," "Countless people are ready to get up every morning and tell the International Monetary Fund, 'To hell with you and your conditions.'"

	The newspaper commentary concluded by pointing out that Brazil's rejection of loan negotiations with the International Monetary Fund is a noteworthy and unprecedented event.

    拉丁美洲人民斗争息息相关
    墨西哥舆论反对“美洲国家组织”干涉尼加拉瓜的事务
    阿根廷公众支持巴西停止同“国际货币基金组织”谈判
    新华社22日讯　墨西哥城消息：墨西哥官方人士和舆论反对美洲国家组织干涉尼加拉瓜人民的反独裁斗争。
    据墨西哥“最后消息报”报道，墨西哥外交部长曼努埃尔·泰略最近在接见记者谈到美洲国家组织干涉尼加拉瓜问题时说，墨西哥的立场是以它的外交政策的主要原则为基础的。这首先就是不干涉原则，因为墨西哥认为，任何国家都没有权利干涉别国内政。毫无疑问，美洲国家组织也不应当干涉会员国的内政。
    墨西哥“新闻报”发表文章，抨击美洲国家组织干涉拉丁美洲国家的内政威胁了这些国家的自由和独立。
    文章指出，美洲国家组织是派代表去尼加拉瓜收集有关这个国家发生起义的性质的情报，尼加拉瓜进行的是内部革命，其目的是推翻不符合人民利益的政府。墨西哥代表在美洲国家组织讨论这个问题时就曾经指出，美洲国家组织干涉尼加拉瓜问题开了一个危险的先例。美洲国家组织的这种事件可以把它自己变成镇压人民意志的工具。
    “新闻报”最后写道，不为本国人民所支持的政府总是企图把内部问题变成国际问题，然后就向国际组织，如果顺利的话，就向关心保持现状的外国力量进行呼吁。
    新华社22日讯　布宜诺斯艾利斯消息：阿根廷公众舆论赞扬和支持巴西政府最近宣布停止同美国控制下的国际货币基金组织的贷款谈判。
    阿根廷“六十二工会”指导委员会发表了一个声明，庆贺巴西拒绝国际货币基金组织给予巴西财政“援助”所附加的可耻的条件。声明说，巴西人民无疑地必将全力以赴使巴西不致于典押它的主权和丧失它的民族的尊严。这个声明还指出，由于巴西总统拒绝了同国际货币基金组织进行贷款谈判，巴西人民应该为自己的总统的这种行动感到骄傲。
    阿根廷“理性报”指出，这一事件在圣地亚哥、布宜诺斯艾利斯以及在其他要求国际货币基金组织援助的国家中引起了纷纷的议论。这家报纸的评论说，国际货币基金组织在跟一些南美国家的政府打交道时没能“得心应手”，因为他们确信接受国际货币基金组织的条件意味着允许外国人控制自己国家的财政。
    评论强调指出，阿根廷接受了国际货币基金组织提出的所谓“稳定经济计划”以后，情况就是这样：“如果国际货币基金组织的意见不受到尊重，这个组织连一分钱也不提供”。
    “理性报”在谴责国际货币基金组织的所谓贷款条件时说，“听凭别人吩咐，应该怎样使用银行贷款，应该进口什么，不应该进口什么，这是人人都不同意的，”“无数的人们准备每天早晨一起来就对国际货币基金组织说，你和你的条件都见鬼去吧”。
    报纸评论最后指出，巴西拒绝国际货币基金组织的贷款谈判，是一件值得注意的前所未闻的事。
