Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, June 22nd: In the beautiful Nixeslinka (Linka Garden) on the banks of the Lhasa River, many tents have been set up in the past two days, with colorful flags fluttering and songs and dances resounding among the trees. The people of Lhasa are celebrating their first Linka Festival since the suppression of the rebellion in Lhasa.

The Linka Festival is a mass recreational event in which the Tibetan people, during the season of growth and pleasant weather on the plateau in the summer, bring their tents and food and drink to the Linka for lodging and entertainment. It is held for three days during the 15th, 16th, and 17th days of the Tibetan calendar's fifth month each year. This festival is said to have a history of several hundred years.

Last year, the rebels fired guns and practiced shooting in the Linka on the banks of the Lhasa River, and the people of Lhasa were unable to celebrate the Linka Festival. This year, on the 16th day of the Tibetan calendar's fifth month (June 21st), which fell on a Sunday, Nixeslinka was especially lively. Early in the morning, the citizens of Lhasa, supporting the old and leading the young, brought woolen blankets, highland barley wine, and refreshments, and came here in a continuous stream. Office workers and People's Liberation Army soldiers on Sunday leave also came here to have fun with the Tibetan people. Among the joyful crowd, there were also many herdsmen from the northern grasslands and farmers from the suburbs.

Under a large white canopy in the middle of the Linka, members of the Lhasa Patriotic Youth Federation and the Patriotic Women's Federation performed their newly composed songs and dances, and the drama "The End of a Dynasty," which exposed the truth about the Lhasa rebellion. The Lhasa City Neighborhood Committees also organized garden parties here, and the girls and young men danced gracefully in bright national costumes. In a dance circle of the Lhasa Chengdong District Neighborhood Committee, a girl named Langjia sang while dancing: "Is anyone going to Beijing? Please give this snow-white Hada to Chairman Mao. The past days were as dark as hell, and today, the sun of happiness shines on the heads of us poor people." This girl used to be a domestic slave of the traitor Yuto Tashi Tundrup. In previous Linka Festivals, she had to serve the serf owners closely and could not participate in singing and dancing. Dorje Phuntsok, who had been a domestic slave in the home of the traitor Tsering Dondrup since he was a child, led thirty people in a "Happy Tap Dance." Dorje Phuntsok is now the deputy director of the Seventh Neighborhood Committee in the Chengnan District of Lhasa.

More than 500 lamas from Ganden Monastery also traveled more than 40 kilometers to Lhasa to celebrate the Linka Festival, and they also performed religious dances.

### 幸福的太阳照到了我们的头上  拉萨人民欢度林卡节

    幸福的太阳照到了我们的头上
    拉萨人民欢度林卡节
    新华社拉萨22日电　在拉萨河畔风景优美的尼雪林卡（林园）里，近两天来搭起了许多帐篷，丛丛树荫中彩旗飘扬，歌舞欢腾。拉萨人民在这里欢度叛乱平息后的拉萨第一个林卡节。
    林卡节是西藏人民在万物生长、风和日丽的高原夏季里，带着帐篷和酒食到林卡里住宿、游玩的群众性娱乐节目，在每年藏历5月15、16、17日三天内举行。这个节日相传已经有好几百年的历史。
    去年这时候，叛匪在拉萨河畔的林卡中鸣枪打靶，拉萨人民没有过成林卡节。今年藏历5月16日（公历6月21日），正逢星期日，尼雪林卡里特别热闹。清早，拉萨市民们就扶老携幼，带着羊毛毯、青稞酒和茶点，络绎不绝地来到这里。星期日休假的机关工作人员和人民解放军官兵也纷纷来到这里和藏族人民一起玩乐。在欢乐的人群中，还有很多来自北方草原的牧民和郊区的农民。
    在林卡中间的一顶宽大的白色天幕下，拉萨市爱国青年联谊会和爱国妇女联谊会的会员们，演出了他们自己新编的歌舞节目，和揭露拉萨叛乱真相的话剧“王朝末日”。拉萨市各居民委员会也在这里组织了游园活动，姑娘们和小伙子们穿着鲜艳的民族服装翩翩起舞。在拉萨城东区居民委员会的一个舞圈里，一位名叫郎佳的姑娘一面跳舞，一面高唱：“有人上北京去吗？请把我这条雪白的哈达献给毛主席。过去的日子像地狱一样黑暗，今天，幸福的太阳才照我们穷人的头上。”这个姑娘过去是叛国头子宇妥·扎西顿珠的家奴。往年林卡节，她得寸步不离地侍候农奴主，不能参加唱歌跳舞。从小就在叛国头子擦绒·达桑占度家里当家奴的多吉彭措，领着三十人一起跳“幸福踢踏舞”。多吉彭措现在是拉萨城南区第七居民委员会副主任。
    噶丹寺的五百多名喇嘛，也走了四十多公里路来到拉萨欢度林卡节，他们也表演了宗教舞蹈。
