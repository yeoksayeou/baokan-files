    Preventing Wind Damage to Fruit Trees

    Throughout the year, there are winds of varying intensity every month. Especially during the four months from May to August, the wind is often strong. This is also the peak growing season for fruit trees, and strong winds can easily damage them. Light winds can blow off fruit and break small branches; heavy winds can break large branches and trunks, and even uproot trees. According to a survey by the Qingdao Agricultural Science Institute of Shandong Province, during a strong wind (level 7 to 8) in July 1958, more than 20 fruit trees with diameters of 5 to 8 centimeters were broken in one village in Laiyang County. In August of the same year, more than 500 fruit trees in this village had branches broken by strong winds. During a strong wind in Tai'an, Shandong in May 1958, more than 4,450 jin of young fruit were blown off (averaging 32 fruits per jin at the time), and if calculated at four fruits per jin when they grow up, the loss is very large.

    From flowering to harvest, during these seven months, fruit trees suffer a great loss of flowers and fruits due to wind damage. Therefore, preventing wind damage is a very important task in fruit tree production.

    How can we prevent and reduce the damage of strong winds to fruit trees? The most fundamental way is to build windbreaks, which can greatly reduce wind force. Therefore, all newly built orchards should also plant windbreaks. However, this is a long-term solution, and it is difficult to achieve and be effective in the short term. A common windbreak measure is "hanging supports," which involves tying a bamboo pole or wooden stick to the main trunk of the fruit tree, and then using ropes to hang each branch on the bamboo pole or wooden stick, so that the branches are fixed and the back and forth swaying of the branches is reduced, which can reduce the shedding of fruit and the breaking of branches. Another method is to lay grass under the fruit trees, or to level the ground under the fruit trees and pick up stones, so that even if the fruits are blown off, they will not be crushed when they fall on the grass. The fallen fruits can also be used for processing or as substandard products, reducing some losses. In addition, there are other methods in various places. As long as they are adapted to local conditions and used properly, losses can be reduced.

    At present, it is the vigorous growth period of fruit trees, and the fruits are rapidly expanding, so we are most afraid of wind damage. Fruit-producing areas in various places should make preparations for preventing strong winds as soon as possible, and regularly listen to weather forecasts. After receiving a strong wind forecast, immediately organize the masses to take preventive measures, which can reduce or avoid losses.

### 预防大风危害果树

    预防大风危害果树
    一年中，每月都有不同强度的风。尤其在5月至8月这四个月中，往往风力较强。而这时又是果树生长旺期，大风容易危害果树。轻的可以吹落果子、折断细枝；重的则折断大枝、树干，甚至连根拔起。据山东省青岛农业科学研究所调查：1958年7月间的一次大风（七级到八级），莱阳县有一个村，被吹断直径五至八厘米的果树二十多株。这个村在同年8月间，有五百多株果树被大风吹断枝条。1958年5月间经过山东泰安的一次大风，就吹落幼小的果子四千四百五十多斤（当时平均三十二个果子一斤），若按果子长大四个一斤折算，损失是很大的。
    果树从开花到收获这七个月当中，受风害损失的花、果非常多。因此，防御风的危害，在果树生产中是一件很重要的事情。
    如何防御和减轻大风对果树的危害呢？最根本的办法是营造防风林，防护林能大大地减弱风力。因此，一切新建的果园，应同时种植防护林。不过，这是一种长远的办法，一时尚难做到和收效。一般防风的措施是“吊架”，即在果树主干上，绑一根竹杆或木棒，然后用绳子把一个个枝条吊在竹杆或木棒上，使枝条固定，减少枝条来回摆动，可以减少果子的脱落和枝条的折断。还有一种办法就是在果树下铺草，或把果树下土地整平、捡去石头，果子即使吹落，掉在草上也不致跌烂。掉下的果子还能用来加工或当次等品，减少一部分损失。此外，各地也还有其他一些办法，只要因地制宜，运用得当，都可减少损失。
    目前，正是果树生长旺盛、果实迅速膨大时期，最怕遭受风害。各地果树产区，应及早做好防御大风的准备工作，并经常收听气象预报。在收听到大风预报后，立即组织群众预防，就可以减少或避免遭受损失。
