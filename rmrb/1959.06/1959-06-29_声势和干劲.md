Momentum and Drive
Ji Fengshan

Recently, I participated in several large-scale inspections of agricultural production. At the beginning, I looked at problems rather superficially. When I saw some production teams, where men, women, old and young were all working hard, with people everywhere, the atmosphere was not small, I praised them, saying they had great momentum and soaring drive, and thought the cadres here were capable and the commune members were highly motivated. But when I saw another situation, such as some production teams, which at first glance seemed quiet in the fields, with no people in sight and no shouting heard, and the commune members working calmly and busily in twos and threes, I couldn't help but feel that this was "insufficient drive" and that the cadres were sluggish.

Upon closer inspection, we found that most of those production teams we praised as having "great momentum" were indeed very good, with great momentum and soaring drive, but a few were actually slow in progress and crude in their farm work. On the other hand, some of the production teams we called "insufficient drive" were actually meticulous in their work, with people and horses not in disarray, and the progress of various farm tasks was very fast. Some production teams, during the summer harvest and planting, and seedling management, implemented contracting work to households, assigning various farm tasks such as harvesting stubble, inter-tillage, and weeding to households based on the amount of labor available, setting quality requirements, stipulating completion times, paying reasonable remuneration, and formulating reward methods. Everyone shared the heavy burden, overcoming problems such as low labor efficiency, crowded work, and rough quality of farm work. After doing this, good and bad were clearly distinguished, the masses were satisfied, the quality of farm work was guaranteed, labor efficiency was improved, and the role of auxiliary labor in each household was brought into play. Therefore, although we had not seen the great momentum of these teams, their various farm tasks were completed with quality and quantity, and some even took the lead.

From this, I realized that the extent of drive is not entirely reflected in certain superficial momentum. Especially when the mass movement (and production movement is also a kind of mass movement) has become more in-depth, it often differs from the vigorous form it had at the beginning of the movement. Therefore, examining the movement with a fixed viewpoint often leads to one-sidedness.

How can we truly distinguish between the extent of drive and the merits of forms? I think the most important thing is for the inspector to go deep, deep, and even deeper.

    声势和干劲
    纪风山
    近来，我参加过几次农业生产大检查。开始时候，看问题比较表面化。一看到有的生产队，干起活来男女老幼齐出动，遍地人群，气势不小，就称赞说声势浩大，干劲冲天，认为这里的干部有办法，社员积极性高。但当看到另一种情况的时候，比如有些生产队，乍看起来地里安安静静，看不见人群，听不到呐喊，社员们三三两两从容而紧张地劳动着。就不免觉得这是“干劲不足”，干部疲沓。
    当深入一检查的时候，我们发现那些被我们赞许为“声势浩大”的生产队，大多数确是很好的，确是声势浩大，干劲冲天，但也有个别的竟是进度迟缓，农活粗糙：而被我们称之为“干劲不足”的生产队，有的却是活道细致，人马不乱，各项农活进度都很快。有一些生产队，夏收夏种、幼苗管理施行了包工到户，将收割灭茬、中耕锄草各项农活，根据各户劳力多少一次包到户，提出质量要求，规定完成时间，付给合理报酬，并制定了奖励办法。千斤担子大家担，克服了劳动效率不高，干活拥挤，农活质量粗糙等现象。这样作之后，好坏分明，群众满意，保证了农活质量，提高了劳动效率，发挥了各户辅助劳力的作用。因此，我们虽没见到过这些队的浩大声势，可是，他们的各项农活却都能按质按量完成，有的还跑在了前头。
    由此，我认识到：干劲的大小，并不完全都表现在某些表面的声势上。特别是当群众运动（生产运动也是一种群众运动）比较深入了的时候，往往就同运动初起时那种轰轰烈烈的形式有所不同，因此，以一种固定的观点来考察运动，往往就会失之于片面。
    怎样才能真正区别清楚干劲的大小和形式的优劣呢？我想，最重要的是需要检查者深入，深入，更深入。
