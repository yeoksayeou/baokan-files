Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, June 1st: Commercial departments in Jian’ou County, Fujian Province, have adopted various methods to assist communes in organizing short-distance transportation, managing purchase, sales, and also transportation, which has played a significant role in increasing the supply of goods and invigorating production in mountain villages.

Jian’ou County produces timber, bamboo, dried bamboo shoots, shiitake mushrooms, medicinal materials, handmade paper, and other industrial raw materials and local specialties, which are sold throughout the province and beyond. Since the spring of this year, the county's agriculture, forestry, and sideline occupations have further developed, and the amount of materials transported to other places has greatly increased compared to the same period last year. In light of this situation, Jian’ou County's commercial departments have changed their practice of only managing purchasing and sales without managing transportation. While carrying out purchasing and sales business, they actively assist communes and production teams in rationally organizing short-distance transportation.

They combined the transportation force of more than 130 commercial purchasing and sales stations located in various communes and production teams with the transportation teams of the communes and production teams. They also helped communes and production teams with weak transportation capabilities to establish professional transportation teams and seasonal shock transportation teams that are both farmers and transporters. They assisted communes and production teams in remote areas in finding direct transportation routes, shortening transportation mileage. In areas rich in bamboo and charcoal, they helped communes and production teams build seven aerial cableways, bamboo slipways, and wooden tracks, etc., so that local specialties from the deep mountains can be continuously transported out.

    运出土特产品　运进生产资料
    建瓯商业部门管购管销管运协助公社活跃经济
    据新华社福州1日电　福建省建瓯县商业部门采取各种办法协助公社组织短途运输，既管购、管销又管运，对增加商品货源和活跃山村生产都起了很大作用。
    建瓯县出产的木材、毛竹、笋干、香菇、药材、土纸等工业原料和土特产品，行销省内外各地。今年春季以来，全县农林副业进一步发展，运往外地的物资比去年同期大大增加。根据这种情况，建瓯县商业部门便改变只管购销不管运输的作法，在开展购销业务的同时，积极协助公社、生产队合理组织短途运输。
    他们把设在各公社、生产队的一百三十多个商业购销站的运输力量，和公社生产队的运输队伍结合起来，并且帮助运输力量薄弱的公社、生产队建立专业运输队和亦农亦运的季节性突击运输队；协助偏僻地区的公社、生产队寻找直线运输线路，缩短了运输里程。在盛产毛竹、柴炭的地区，他们帮助公社、生产队修建了七条架空索道、竹片滑道和木轨道等，使深山的土特产品能够源源外运。
