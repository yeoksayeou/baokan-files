People's Daily, Chengdu, 7th: The Liangping County Party Committee of Sichuan Province, while vigorously promoting industrial and agricultural production, has proposed the practice of emphasizing industry, agriculture, and commerce equally, treating commercial work as a component of production, unifying planning, and strengthening leadership, so that industrial and agricultural production and commercial work advance simultaneously.

The Liangping County Party Committee believes that the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production has brought more arduous tasks to commercial work. If commercial work cannot keep up, it will affect the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, the market arrangement, and people's lives. Therefore, according to the development of the situation, the County Party Committee put forward the slogan of "Politics in Command, Subordinate to the Center, Participate in Production, Advance Simultaneously" for commercial work. When arranging industrial and agricultural production tasks for each period, commercial work is also considered comprehensively and deployed in a unified manner. The "three contracts" system of contracting industry, contracting agriculture, and contracting commerce is implemented in Party organizations at all levels below the county. Commercial plans and industrial and agricultural production plans are issued to the communes at the same time, and then the commercial departments implement the plans to the production teams through the signing of contracts. This closely integrates commercial work with industrial and agricultural production. Party organizations at all levels inspect production and also inspect commercial work. As a result, the county completed its purchasing and marketing plan thirty-five days ahead of schedule last year, and the purchasing and sales plans from January to May this year increased by 221% and 98.85% respectively compared with the same period last year.

In the case of very tight industrial and agricultural production and very busy central work, in order to enable commercial work to better promote production development, Liangping County has adopted the method of starting with production, focusing on the center, mobilizing the masses, and combining regular work with crash work, constantly organizing leap forwards and then leap forwards again. In August last year, when steel production and the "Four Autumns" campaign were in full swing, both industry and agriculture put forward many new demands for means of production and means of livelihood. At this time, the commercial departments seized every opportunity to fully mobilize the masses, vigorously explore resources, and organize the supply of materials. The county successively dispatched more than 9,000 commercial workers, merchants, and other logistics forces to support the steel production base, and successively supplied more than 86,000 various tools and more than 2 million catties of non-staple food. At the same time, combined with the "Four Autumns" campaign, a concentrated effort was made to purchase agricultural products, and the purchasing work was also completed ahead of schedule and exceeded the target.

In promoting the development of diversified economy in the communes, the commercial departments also widely promoted the contract system, assisted the communes in formulating plans, helped the communes to carry out "Ten Major Breedings," "Ten Major Cultivations," and "Twenty Major Processings," and solved problems such as seeds and technology; they organized more than 6,200 diversified economy professional teams, prompting the communes to develop commodity production in a more planned way, enabling the communes to increase their income by more than 10 million yuan from December last year to the end of April this year.

This year, Liangping County's commercial departments, in the spirit of "grasping tightly from the beginning and grasping tightly from beginning to end," fully utilized the experience of launching mass movements last year, focusing on supporting spring plowing and production, and concentrated on organizing the production and supply of means of production. In the first quarter, the county stored more than 1.5 million pieces of large and small farm tools, and produced and supplied various fertilizers, pesticides, and other means of production. At the same time, more than 2,000 cadres and iron and wood workers were organized to go to the countryside to inspect and repair more than 3,000 new-style farm tools and various large and small old-style farm tools, providing timely support for spring plowing and production.

In the allocation of materials in commercial work, Liangping County has done a good job in completing the sales plans for urban and rural materials in accordance with the principle of overall planning for urban and rural areas, domestic and foreign. The plans for outward transfer of materials and export have also been completed ahead of schedule and exceeded the target. In the first quarter of this year, the county's outward transfer of materials increased by 26% compared with the same period last year. Among them, more than 8,000 live pigs were transferred outward, more than twice as many as in the same period last year.

In order to adapt to the situation of this year's bumper harvest of spring crops and the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, Liangping County's commercial departments launched a high tide of technological innovation from the first quarter of this year, vigorously engaged in the mechanization of processing and transportation, and expanded processing and transportation capacity. Under the unified arrangement of the Party Committee, the commercial departments in various places closely combined with production, planned and acted simultaneously. By May, the county had built 225 hydraulic and animal-powered grain processing plants, and more than 200 grain and oil processing plants were under construction. Among them, the grain processing plants alone can process 159.61 million catties of grain annually after completion, saving 1.72 million labor forces, and increasing the country's accumulation by more than 400,000 yuan annually. In terms of transportation, the county is advancing towards cart-ization and wooden boat-ization. At present, more than 20,300 various flatbed carts and wheelbarrows and 15 wooden boats have been built, striving to achieve cart-ization of transportation in all places with highways in the second quarter, and all large and small rivers that can be navigated will be open to wooden boats, further improving the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas and saving labor.

    梁平县通盘安排层层布置
    包工业  包农业  包商业
    本报成都7日电  中共四川省梁平县委在大抓工农业生产的同时，提出了工农商并举的做法，把商业工作当作生产的一个组成部分，统一安排，加强领导，使工农业生产和商业工作同时跃进。
    梁平县委认为工农业生产大跃进给商业工作带来了更加繁重的任务，如果商业工作跟不上，就会影响工农业生产大跃进，影响市场安排和人民生活。因此，县委根据形势的发展，对商业工作提出了“政治挂帅，服从中心，参与生产，同时跃进”的口号。在安排每个时期的工农业生产任务时，对商业工作也通盘考虑，统一布置，并在县以下各级党组织中实行包工业、包农业、包商业的“三包”制度，将商业计划和工农业生产计划同时下达公社，然后由商业部门通过签订合同再把计划落实到生产队。这样就使商业工作与工农业生产紧密结合起来。各级党组织检查生产，也同时检查商业工作，因此去年全县提前三十五天完成了购销计划，今年1月至5月份的购进和销售计划又比去年同期分别增长了221％和98.85％。
    在工农业生产很紧张、中心工作十分繁忙的情况下，为了使商业工作更好地促进生产发展，梁平县采取的办法是从生产入手，围绕中心，发动群众，经常工作与突击工作相结合，不断组织跃进再跃进。去年8月，大搞钢铁生产和“四秋”运动，工业和农业都对生产资料和生活资料提出了许多新的要求。这时，商业部门就见缝插针，充分发动群众，大力挖掘资源，组织物资供应。全县先后派出九千多名商业职工、商贩等后勤大军，支援钢铁生产基地，先后供应了各种工具八万六千多件，副食品二百多万斤。同时，结合“四秋”运动，突击采购农产品，结果收购工作也提前超额完成了任务。
    在促进公社发展多种经济的活动中，商业部门还广泛推行了合同制度，协助公社制订规划，帮助公社开展“十大养”、“十大栽培”、“二十大加工”以及解决种子、技术等问题；组织了多种经济专业队六千二百多个，促使公社更有计划地发展商品生产，使公社从去年12月至今年4月底增加收入一千多万元。
    今年梁平县商业部门本着“一开头就抓紧，自始至终都抓紧”的精神，充分运用去年开展群众运动的经验，以支援春耕生产为中心，突击组织了生产资料的生产和供应。第一季度，全县就储备了大小农具一百五十多万件，并生产和供应了各种化肥、农药等生产资料。同时组织了二千多名干部和铁、木工人下乡，检查整修了三千多部新式农具和各种大小旧式农具，及时地支援了春耕生产。
    在商业工作中的物资分配上，梁平县按照城、乡、内、外统筹安排的原则，城乡物资销售计划完成得很好，外调物资和出口计划也提前超额完成。今年第一季度，全县外调物资比去年同期增加了26％。其中生猪外调八千多头，比去年同期增加两倍以上。
    为了适应今年小春作物丰收和工农业生产跃进的形势，梁平县商业部门从今年第一季度起就掀起了技术革新高潮，大搞加工和运输机械化，扩大加工、运输能力。各地商业部门在党委统一安排下，紧密结合生产，边规划，边行动，到5月份为止，全县已建成水力和畜力粮食加工厂二百二十五个，还有二百多个粮食和油脂加工厂正在赶紧施工。其中仅粮食加工厂全部建成后，每年可加工粮食一亿五千九百六十一万斤，可节约劳动力一百七十二万个，一年就可为国家增加积累四十万元以上。在运输方面，全县正在向车子化、木船化进军，现在已造各种板车、架子车二万零三百多部，木船十五只，争取在第二季度内做到凡是有公路的地方都实行运输车子化，能够通航的大小河流全部通行木船，进一步搞好城乡物资交流工作，并节约劳动力。
