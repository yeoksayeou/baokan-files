Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 9th - Farmers in Shandong are racing against the weather to harvest and thresh their wheat, determined to bring in every grain of their bumper crop.

From the 6th to the 8th, most parts of the province saw clearer weather after the rain. Farmers who had been battling the elements for three days, aided by cadres from government offices, workers, soldiers, and students, were working day and night to harvest and thresh wheat. In the three Special Zones of Liaocheng, Linyi, and Jining, the labor force engaged in wheat harvesting increased from over one million to over five million six hundred thousand in the past few days. By the 8th, the Liaocheng Special Zone had already harvested over three million mu of wheat. In Jining, Linyi Special Zones, and various counties of Jinan City, the harvested wheat accounted for about 30% of the wheat field area. Zibo, Changwei, Yantai, and other special zones have also made arrangements for rush harvesting, threshing, and transportation, striving to complete all the ripe wheat harvesting before the rainy season arrives on June 15th, ensuring that every grain is safely stored.

At the beginning of June, as wheat harvesting was just beginning in Shandong, continuous rain fell across the province. Farmers everywhere immediately launched a campaign to combat the rain and protect the wheat. After receiving the weather forecast of rainfall on the 3rd, the nine counties and cities of the Linyi Special Zone immediately organized two million two hundred and eighty thousand laborers to rush the harvest and transport. According to the strength of the labor force and the level of skill, each People’s Commune formed three specialized teams for harvesting, transporting, and field management, implementing assembly line operations to engage in a tense battle against the elements. The People's Communes in the three counties of Cangshan, Tancheng, and Rizhao adopted the method of leaders being responsible for teams and commune members being assigned responsibility for specific areas, implementing assembly line operations for rush harvesting and threshing. In three days, they rushed to harvest over four hundred thousand mu of wheat, ensuring that it was threshed immediately after harvesting and properly preserved.

According to weather forecasts, there will be showers in Shandong on the 9th and 10th, and continuous rain after the 15th. In order to seize the time for a concentrated wheat harvest, the entire province has mobilized more than ten million laborers to rush the harvest and thresh day and night. Many counties have made two sets of arrangements, one for sunny days and one for rainy days.

This newspaper, Hefei, 9th - Anhui Province's farmers have been battling the rain in recent days and have managed to harvest most of their wheat.

Since the beginning of May, it has been raining in the Huaibei, Huainan, and southern Anhui regions. In order to prevent the ripe wheat from getting damp and moldy, all localities urgently deployed forces for the wheat harvest battle, organizing shock brigades for rush harvesting, transportation, and threshing, and clearing out a large number of houses to store wheat sheaves and grains.

During the rush harvesting in the rain, the Wuhu Special Zone dispatched an army of three hundred thousand to carry out a concentrated rush harvest. Bengbu City organized fifty thousand people to rush harvest the wheat in the suburbs. On June 4th alone, they braved strong winds and heavy rain to rush harvest five hundred and sixty mu of wheat. In Xuji District of Liu'an County, six thousand two hundred mu of wheat were rushed to harvest from the 3rd to the 4th.

Various localities have also taken emergency measures to prevent the harvested wheat from becoming damp and moldy. The Taiping People's Commune of Quanjiao County mobilized four hundred and fifty people to form a shock group for picking and cutting wheat, moving all the wheat from two hundred and ten mu of low-lying fields to higher ground to dry; two hundred and fifty mu of wheat that had fallen over or were prone to waterlogging were also rushed to be cut and carried to the threshing ground; the wheat that had been threshed before the rain but was not yet dry was placed in a ventilated place to dry; some of the overly damp wheat was dried by fire and then handed over to processing plants for processing and consumption. Therefore, during the rainy period, none of the wheat in this brigade was lost to mold.

    千百万人冒雨抢收抢打抢运
    山东安徽全力夺麦
    据新华社济南9日电　山东各地农民正同风雨争夺粮食，全力抢收抢打，誓把丰收的小麦全部拿到手。
    6日到8日，全省大部地区雨后放晴，同风雨连战三天的各地农民，在机关干部、工人、部队官兵和学生的帮助下，日夜抢收抢打小麦。聊城、临沂、济宁三个专区参加收割小麦的劳力，由前几天的一百多万人，增加到五百六十多万人。到8日，聊城专区已经收割小麦三百多万亩。济宁、临沂专区和济南市各县，割完的小麦已占麦田面积30％左右。淄博、昌潍、烟台等专区也都做了抢收、抢打、抢运的安排，力争在6月15日雨季到来前，把成熟的小麦全部收打完毕，颗粒归仓。
    6月初山东麦收刚刚开始，全省连绵阴雨，各地农民就展开了同风雨作斗争的抢收护麦运动。临沂专区九个县市在接到3日降雨的气象预报以后，立即组织二百二十八万劳力抢收抢运。各人民公社根据劳力强弱和技术高低情况，分别组成了收割、拉运、场间管理三种专业队，实行流水作业，同风雨展开紧张的斗争。苍山、郯城、日照三个县的人民公社，采取领导干部分队负责，社员划片包干的办法，实行流水作业，抢收抢打，三天之内抢收小麦四十多万亩，并且做到随收随打，妥善保存。
    据气象预报，9、10两日山东又有阵雨，15日以后连绵阴雨。为了抢时间突击麦收，全省已集中一千多万劳力连夜抢收抢打。许多县作了晴天、雨天两套安排。
    本报合肥9日电　安徽省农民连日来同阴雨搏斗，已经将大部分小麦抢收到手。
    5月初以来，淮北、淮南和皖南地区普遍下雨。为了防止成熟的小麦受潮霉烂，各地紧急部署了麦收战斗，组织了抢收抢运抢打的突击队，并且腾出了大批房子堆放麦把和麦粒。
    在冒雨抢收中，芜湖专区出动了三十万大军突击抢收。蚌埠市组织五万人突击抢收郊区的小麦，6月4日一天就冒着大风大雨抢收了五百六十亩小麦。六安县徐集区在3日到4日就抢收小麦六千二百亩。
    各地还采取紧急措施，防止收割的小麦受潮霉烂。全椒县太平公社明起大队发动四百五十人组成挑麦、割麦突击组，把二百一十亩低洼田的麦子全部搬到高地晾起来；二百五十亩已倒伏和易受涝的小麦也全部抢割完挑上麦场；对雨前脱粒未干的小麦，即放在通风的地方晾干；部分过潮的麦子用火炕干，然后交给加工厂加工食用。因此，在阴雨期间，这个大队的麦子都没有霉烂损失。
