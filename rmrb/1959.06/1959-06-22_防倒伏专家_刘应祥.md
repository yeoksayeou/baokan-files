    Anti-Lodging Expert - Liu Yingxiang
    By our reporter Zhang Lizhong
    To get from Yanshi County Station to Yuetan Village, you have to pass through the county's ten-thousand-mu high-yield wheat area. Look how well the wheat is growing, so many plants, such big ears, and such tall stalks. I have been to many wheat-producing areas in Henan, and I have never seen such good wheat; it is a pity that so much of it has lodged. When I arrived at Yuetan Village, the wheat was growing even better. What was surprising was that very little of the more than one thousand mu of wheat was lodged. Therefore, I made a special trip to visit Comrade Liu Yingxiang to ask him what good experiences he had. Liu Yingxiang is a national advanced producer, a specially invited researcher at the Henan Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences, and the Party Branch Secretary of the Yuetan Brigade in the Laocheng Commune of Yanshi. He always modestly said that he didn't have much to offer. Later, Vice-Secretary Li Jiayin revealed the secret.
    The wheat fields here were originally deeply ploughed; after deep ploughing, the wheat roots grow more and stronger, and the roots are deep and firm, which generally plays a role in preventing lodging; but Liu Yingxiang was not satisfied with this. He further studied the fertilization problem after deep ploughing. He found from the growth of wheat roots last year that the middle part of the roots grew more, and the uppermost and lowermost roots grew less. Therefore, it was decided to apply 50% of the base fertilizer in the middle layer of the soil, and 25% each at the top and bottom. This is called the "root-based fertilization method to strengthen roots," which can make the wheat seedlings develop good root systems and make the wheat less prone to lodging.
    In the past, Henan had the experience of watering the "returning green" water and the jointing water. Some brigades in the ten-thousand-mu high-yield area thought that the wheat had enough base fertilizer this year and should water the "returning green" water and the jointing water early to promote the seedlings to increase tillering. According to the wheat growth this year, Liu Yingxiang delayed watering the "returning green" water and watered the jointing water later, so that the wheat roots squatted down and the seedlings were strong. This method also played a role in preventing lodging.
    Despite the above measures, after Qingming, the team's wheat still grew a foot high. In the past, there was a local agricultural saying here: "If the Qingming festival drowns the dog (referring to the height of the wheat seedlings), one mu yields one dou; if the Qingming festival drowns the wild goose, one mu yields one dan," indicating that early overgrowth of wheat is not good. Liu Yingxiang remembered that more than thirty mu of wheat had lodged here in 1958 because of early excessive growth. We must do everything possible to prevent wheat lodging! So he specially found specimens of lodged wheat straw and non-lodged wheat straw from last year for comparison and found that the two nodes at the base of the lodged wheat were longer than those of the non-lodged wheat. The reason for lodging was here! But what can be done to make the two nodes at the base short? He thought hard for a long time, but got no results. In late February this year, the commune members went to the Duanwan village next door to attend the temple fair. Liu Yingxiang suddenly remembered that the wheat around the temple fair had been trampled on in previous years, but why did it grow well and not lodge afterwards? He ran to Duanwan village and found his aunt, wanting to find out the reason. His aunt said, "That's because the gods don't mistreat people." When Liu Yingxiang heard this, he knew it was wrong and turned around and went to the wheat field at the temple fair to observe carefully. He saw that after the trampled wheat grew up, the stalks were very thick and hard. He went home and measured one square meter in the wheat field and trampled all the seedlings down with his feet. Five or six days later, he went to see it again, and the wheat had grown up again. However, hard lumps grew at the places where the wheat stalks had been damaged. He reported the research process at the Party branch meeting and also led the commune members to see the experimental field. The commune members were all convinced. Everyone started working together and rolled the more than one thousand mu of wheat fields several times. Below are the records of their two rollings (unit: centimeters):

    Time      Treatment Method   First Node Length   Seedling Height   Number of Stems   Effective Tillers
              Not Rolled          1.5                29.9             21              15
    February 27 Rolled Once        0.73               27.6             19              15
    March 12   Rolled Twice       0.76               24.5             18              16

    It can be seen from this that after rolling, the first node of the wheat seedling was shortened by about half, greatly enhancing its resistance to lodging.
    The above are the measures Liu Yingxiang took to prevent wheat lodging. Of course, in addition to this, Liu Yingxiang also used the experience of soil cultivation to prevent corn lodging in the autumn, and cultivated one to two thousand catties of old wall soil per mu of wheat land. The phosphorus and potassium fertilizer contained in the old wall soil played a role in strengthening the stalks. Around the Qingming Festival, 700 mu of land was also top-dressed with 200 catties of wood ash per mu, which also played a role in preventing lodging.

    防倒伏专家——刘应祥
    本报记者　张励中
    从偃师县车站去岳滩村，要经过这县的小麦万亩丰产区。看那片麦子长得多好，株又多，穗又大，秆又高。我在河南走过不少小麦产区，还没有看到有这么好的；可惜倒伏得太多了。等我来到岳滩村，麦子长得更好。出奇的是那一千多亩麦子很少见到倒伏的。因此，我特地去访问刘应祥同志，请教他这里边有什么好经验。刘应祥是全国先进生产者、河南省农业科学研究所特约研究员、偃师老城公社岳滩大队的党支部书记。他总客气地说没有什么。后来还是副支书李甲寅同志给揭开了这个秘密。
    这里的麦地本来是深翻过的；地经过深翻，麦根生得多，长得壮，根深柢固，一般能起到防倒伏的作用；但是刘应祥并没有因此满足，他进一步研究了深翻后的施肥问题。他从去年麦根生长情况中发现，中间部分根长得多，最上和最下根都长得少。因此决定把50％的底肥施在土壤的中层，上下各施25％。这就叫作“因根施肥壮根法”，可以使麦苗根系发育良好，麦子不易倒伏。
    过去，河南有浇返青水、拔节水的经验。万亩丰产区有些大队以为今年麦子底肥足，应该早浇返青水和拔节水，催促麦苗增加分蘖。刘应祥根据今年小麦生长情况，却缓浇返青水，晚浇拔节水，使麦根往下蹲，麦苗健壮。这个办法也起了防倒伏的作用。
    尽管采取了以上一些措施，过了清明，这个队的麦子仍然长了尺把高。过去这里有句农谚：“清明淹住狗（指麦苗高度），一亩打一斗；清明淹住雁，一亩打一石”，说明麦子早期徒长没好处。刘应祥想起1958年这里倒伏了三十多亩麦子，就是因为早期生长过旺。一定得千方百计防止小麦倒伏！于是他特地找出去年倒伏的麦秸标本和没倒伏的麦秸标本作对比，发现倒伏的麦子根部两节比没倒伏的麦节都要长。原来倒伏的原因就在这里！但是，有什么办法能叫根部两节长得短短的？他苦苦想了很久，没有结果。今年2月下旬，社员纷纷去到邻村段弯赶庙会。刘应祥偶然想起来，往年看到庙会周围的麦子被人踩来踏去，为什么以后反而长得好，不倒伏呢？他跑到段弯村，找到他的姨，想问出个原因来。他姨说：“那是神不亏人。”刘应祥一听这话，是反贴门神——不对脸，扭头就到庙会的麦地里仔细观察。只见那被踩倒的麦子长起来后，秆子都十分粗硬。他回家便在麦地里量了一平方公尺，用脚把麦苗都踩倒了。过了五、六天他再去看，麦子又长起来了。但麦秆受挫折的地方却长出了硬疙瘩。他在党支部会上报告了研究经过，还把社员们领到那块试验地里去看。社员都口服心服了。大家一齐动手，把一千多亩麦田连着镇压了几次。下边是他们镇压两次的记录（单位：公分）：
    时间      处理方法  第一节长  苗高  分株头数  有效分蘖
              没镇压     1.5      29.9     21      15
    2月27日   镇压一次   0.73     27.6     19      15
    3月12日   镇压二次    0.76    24.5     18       16
    从这里可以看出，经过镇压后，麦苗第一节缩短了一半左右，大大增强它的抗倒伏能力。
    以上这些，就是刘应祥防止小麦倒伏的措施。当然，除此以外，刘应祥还根据秋季玉米培土防倒伏的经验，在小麦地一亩培一至两万斤老墙土，老墙土中所含磷、钾肥起了壮秆作用。清明前后，有七百亩地每亩又追施了二百斤草木灰，也起了防止倒伏的作用。
