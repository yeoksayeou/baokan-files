Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, June 16th: The Iraqi People's Groups Liaison Committee issued a statement on the 16th, calling on the Iraqi people to be wary of and thwart the new conspiracies being plotted by imperialists.

	The statement, published in newspapers, said, "Imperialist forces and Arab reactionaries are colluding with domestic feudal elements and conspirators in a plot to undermine our republic and restore imperialist (rule) in our country."

	The statement called on all citizens to "remain constantly vigilant and be prepared to strike a fatal blow to those who seek to undermine the republic and assassinate the lives of our leaders." The statement demanded that "the ranks of honest democratic forces unite so that conspirators have no opportunity to exploit."

	The statement warned the conspirators that the iron fist of the Iraqi people will fall on the heads of all conspirators or aggressors.

	The Iraqi Democratic Youth Federation Congress also issued a statement calling on young people to respond to the call at any time and participate in the struggle to defend the republic. The statement pointed out that the reactionary group is plotting to first assassinate the most active and loyal nationalists, and then hold provocative demonstrations in order to create chaos and realize their sinister conspiracy.

	On the same day, the "People's Solidarity News" published an editorial saying that imperialists and their agents in Iraq, the reactionaries, "are coordinating their efforts, forming a united front through common goals and equally absurd dreams, their dream being to destroy the heroic republic, overthrow the liberated democratic system, and overthrow the leadership of Qasim." The newspaper pointed out that the enemies within the republic are becoming increasingly rampant and are very blatantly creating chaos. It said, "Affirmative facts prove that the agents of imperialism have recently been busy forming armed gangs, training them to use machine guns and other types of weapons smuggled into Iraq." At the same time, "under the supervision of American militarists, the Iranian authorities are continuing to supply weapons to tribes stationed near the eastern border of Iraq, and are increasingly actively establishing and strengthening espionage links with feudalists and reactionaries in the Kurdish region."

	The editorial concluded by calling on the people to be vigilant, saying, "All those who are concerned about the safety of the heroic republic and concerned about protecting the fruits of the revolution must unite their ranks more closely than ever before, raise their vigilance, and prepare to crush the conspiracies of the enemies of Iraq."

Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, June 16th: On the afternoon of the 16th, about 50,000 people in Baghdad participated in the funeral procession of the five martyrs who were recently killed. According to a report in the "People's Solidarity News" on the 16th, feudal lord and imperialist agent Muhammad Nasr Allah launched an armed attack on farmers in the Al-Islah agricultural area of Nasiriyah on the 15th, killing five people and seriously injuring many others.

	In the Baghdad funeral procession, people held white banners with black characters, on which were written slogans: "We demand revenge for the martyrs of freedom and democracy," "No freedom for the enemies of the people."

	At the front of the procession, a national band played mournful music. Following were some famous leaders of the national movement and representatives of the Iraqi Women's Rights League. The coffins of the martyrs were guarded by members of the People's Resistance Forces in the middle of the funeral procession, followed by leaders of the Farmers' Association.

	The people of Nasiriyah held demonstrations after hearing the news, and telegraphed Prime Minister Qasim, demanding that the perpetrators be punished.

	Newspapers also published telegrams from people all over Iraq demanding that the government take firm measures against the feudal lords.
