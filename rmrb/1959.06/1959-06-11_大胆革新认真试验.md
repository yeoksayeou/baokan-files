    Boldly Innovate and Conscientiously Experiment
    Kong Sang
    Bold innovation and creation in production methods and technology is a prominent feature of the Great Leap Forward in our country. Because the broad masses, cadres, and technical personnel have emancipated their minds and carried forward the spirit of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do, our industrial and transportation enterprises, almost without exception, have improved operating techniques to varying degrees, improved equipment, improved labor organization, and eliminated unreasonable rules and regulations; many processing industrial enterprises have also improved product designs. All of these have greatly unleashed production potential. Therefore, whether in industrial or agricultural production, we must continue to mobilize the masses and carry forward the spirit of daring to innovate and daring to create.
    We advocate boldly mobilizing the masses to boldly innovate production methods and technology, but we also advocate that everything should be tested. Countless past experiences have proven that innovations and creations that have undergone repeated experimentation have yielded greater results and stood the test of practice. Examples include the comprehensive large drafting in textiles, high-efficiency carding machines, and the clay mold casting method in casting. On the contrary, those that have not been thoroughly tested to prove their feasibility and are rashly promoted have resulted in the opposite, and even caused some losses, such as a decline in product quality, easy damage to equipment, and a lack of safety guarantees. Therefore, no matter which aspect of innovation and creation, practical experiments should be conducted to prove that it is indeed effective before it can be promoted. At the same time, when applying these new methods, new technologies, and new experiences, the masses, cadres, and technical personnel should also be organized to continue to experiment, so that they adapt to the specific conditions of the region and the enterprise.
    Boldly mobilizing the masses and everything being tested is an important working method. In the spring of 1958, when the situation of the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production in our country had just begun to appear, Comrade Mao Zedong told us that in order to change the face of our country's rural areas in a relatively short period of time, we must adopt the working method of "boldly mobilizing the masses and everything being tested." This working method is, of course, not limited to agriculture, but also applies to industry, transportation, and other undertakings.
    Everything being tested is a Marxist working method. In the eyes of Marxists, "the criterion of truth can only be social practice." ("On Practice") In order to achieve victory in the war against nature, there is no doubt that we should have the courage and revolutionary spirit to despise the "enemy," we should dare to think, dare to speak, and dare to do, and we should break all superstitions, but this does not mean that we can disregard objective laws, we can disrespect science, and we can daydream and rush blindly. On the contrary, it is not easy to understand objective laws, or even just to understand and master production technologies that are not very complex. Therefore, we must both despise the "enemy" and value the "enemy." The modern production equipment we use and the production methods we follow are the result of long-term experimentation and continuous improvement by mankind, and it is certain that they will continue to be improved and even fundamentally innovated; but it is also certain that such improvement and innovation cannot be achieved in one morning. To improve and to innovate, we must go through experimentation, and we must concentrate the wisdom of many people to carry out multiple repeated experiments. Only through experimentation can we understand the mysteries, reveal all aspects of contradictions, and also confirm whether our assumptions are correct. If the assumption is correct, we can begin to improve; if the assumption is incorrect, we must continue to experiment. Some people are unwilling to put in the hard work to do this experiment, and only rely on subjective imagination to hope to transform objective things, then they will inevitably run into obstacles everywhere.
    Now, the technical innovation and technical revolution movement on the industrial front, the transportation front, and other fronts is continuing to move forward. In order to make this movement develop better, reiterating the principle of everything being tested is absolutely necessary.

    大胆革新认真试验
    孔桑
    对生产方法和生产技术进行大胆的革新和创造，是我国大跃进中的一个显著的特色。由于广大群众、干部和技术人员解放了思想，发扬了敢想敢说敢做的精神，我们的工业企业和运输企业，几乎无一例外地或多或少地都改进了操作技术，改良了设备，改善了劳动组织，破除了不合理的规章制度；许多加工工业企业还改进了产品的设计。所有这些，都大大地发挥了生产的潜力。因此，无论在工业或农业生产中，我们都必须继续放手发动群众，发扬敢于革新敢于创造的精神。
    我们主张放手发动群众大胆革新生产方法和生产技术，同时又主张一切经过试验。过去无数的经验证明：凡是经过了反复试验的革新和创造，都收效比较大，经得起实践的考验，例如纺织上的综合大牵伸、高效率的梳棉机和铸造方面的泥模铸造法等就是如此。凡是没有经过反复试验证明切实可行而贸然推广的，其结果就相反，甚至还造成一些损失，如产品质量下降，设备容易损坏，安全缺乏保证等等。因此，不论哪一方面的革新和创造，都应当进行切实的试验，证明其确实行之有效，才可推广。同时，在应用这些新方法、新技术、新经验的时候，还应当组织群众、干部和技术人员继续进行试验，使之适应本地区、本企业的具体情况。
    放手发动群众，一切经过试验，这是一个重要的工作方法。1958年春天，当我国工农业生产大跃进的局面刚开始出现的时候，毛泽东同志就告诉我们，要在比较短的时间内改变我国农村的面貌，必须采取“放手发动群众，一切经过试验”的工作方法。这个工作方法，当然不限于农业，同样适用于工业、运输业和其他事业。
    一切经过试验，这是马克思主义的工作方法。在马克思主义者看来，“真理的标准只能是社会的实践。”（“实践论”）我们要在同自然界开战中取得胜利，毫无疑问应当有藐视
  “敌人”的勇气和革命精神，应当敢想敢说敢做，应当破除一切迷信，但是，这并不是说我们就可以不顾客观规律，可以不尊重科学，可以胡思乱想和横冲直闯。事情恰好相反，要认识客观规律，甚至只是了解和掌握并不十分复杂的生产技术，也并不是轻而易举的事情。因此，既要藐视“敌人”，又要重视“敌人”。我们使用的现代化的生产设备，我们遵循的生产方法，是人类长期试验、不断改进的结果，它们将要被人们继续改进以至根本革新，是肯定的；但是决不能在一个早晨就实现这种改进和革新，也是肯定的。要改进，要革新，就必须经过试验，而且必须集中许多人的智慧，进行多次的反复的试验。只有经过试验，我们才能洞察其中的奥秘，揭露矛盾的各个方面，也才能证实我们的设想是否正确。设想如果正确，我们才能着手去改进；设想如果不正确，还得继续试验。有些人不肯下苦功夫去做这种试验，只凭主观想像，就希望改造客观事物，那就一定会到处碰钉子。
    现在，工业战线、运输战线和其他战线上的技术革新和技术革命运动正在继续向前发展，为了使这个运动发展得更好，重申一切经过试验的原则，是完全必要的。
