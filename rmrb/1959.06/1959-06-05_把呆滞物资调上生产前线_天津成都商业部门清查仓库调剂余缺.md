Transfer Stagnant Materials to the Production Frontline
Tianjin and Chengdu Commercial Departments Inventory Warehouses and Reallocate Surpluses and Shortages

According to the Tianjin Daily, commercial departments in Tianjin have mobilized employees to clean warehouses and conduct a general survey of commodity inventories during the increase production and practice economy campaign. They have cleared out a large quantity of materials and promptly supplied them to industrial production and market needs.

Warehouse clearing is an important part of the current increase production and practice economy campaign in Tianjin's commercial departments. From the city to the districts and counties, from wholesale departments to retail outlets, all have conscientiously mobilized the masses, using methods of vigorous airing of views, debates, and big-character posters to check accounts, clear warehouses, and take inventory. This has basically ensured that every warehouse is cleared, forming a mass-based warehouse clearing upsurge.

A large number of materials that had been stagnating in warehouses for a long time were cleared out. Baxian County's commercial departments cleared out six small sleeper cars, thirty-one motorcycles, as well as distillation machines, hot and cold regulators, cranes, refrigerators, etc. Some of these materials were not needed in the countryside, but were in short supply in the city. The Xinlicun People's Commune Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Hedong District and the Matou Central Store in Wuqing County cleared out 160,000 jin of round nails; Jinghai County's accumulated 60,000 light bulbs and a large amount of roofing felt, wood screws, etc., are also urgently needed materials. After the warehouse clearing, the phenomenon of some commodities being stockpiled in one place while being in short supply in another has been initially changed.

Many of the cleared commodities have been promptly sent to the most important places where they are most urgently needed. The Jiaodianzhan Electrician Store cleared out thirty-one types of electrical equipment, including more than 2,000 kilograms of bakelite boards, which were supplied to the Tianjin Power Equipment Factory. The Civilian Equipment Company and the Department Store Retail Company under the Heping District Commercial Bureau held a "Commodity Exchange Fair" to reallocate cleared commodities among their various outlets. More than 540 transactions have now been completed, worth more than 70,000 yuan. Many commodities accumulated in various counties have also been promptly transferred to the city to meet the needs of relevant parties.

Many units have discovered some shortcomings in their management during the warehouse clearing work and are studying how to establish and improve management systems to overcome them.

This newspaper reports that units under the Chengdu Municipal Commercial Bureau recently mobilized employees to comprehensively clear inventory, thoroughly verify accounts and goods, and improve business management and property management, to better support production and further arrange market supply.

During this warehouse clearing campaign, specialized warehouse clearing organizations were established in the bureaus, stations, companies, stores, and warehouses of the Commercial Bureau system. Various companies and stations strengthened cooperation with the storage and transportation companies, divided areas, assigned fixed points, contracted tasks, and cooperated to clear out a large quantity of materials in a few days. The Chengdu Municipal Department Store Wholesale Station cleared out commodities worth a total of 340,000 yuan for which there were goods but no accounts, goods that had arrived but had not been promptly cleared and transferred to accounts, and unprocessed defective commodities, including 54,000 yuan of summer commodities and 130,000 yuan of commodities urgently needed by the market, totaling more than 200 varieties. The Industrial Equipment Company found some good fluorescent tubes and light bulbs among the scrapped materials.

During this warehouse clearing work, all units fully mobilized the masses, not only clearing out large and easily discovered commodities, but also clearing out many commodities that had not been cleared in previous warehouse clearings. For example, the Municipal Department Store Wholesale Station transferred back more than 8,000 pairs of leather shoes from Aba last year. Due to the chaotic packaging and complex specifications, they had not been cleared several times and were piled up in the warehouse and could not be sold. This time, they were thoroughly cleared out and promptly supplied to the market. Through warehouse clearing, many business personnel also cleared out scattered samples and disposed of them at a price; some waste and defective commodities and improperly managed commodities were also processed during the warehouse clearing.

While clearing warehouses, the various units of the Commercial Bureau system also implemented the methods of clearing, processing, and improving simultaneously, establishing and improving various management systems, practicing economy and managing finances, and grasping purchasing, sales, allocation, and storage simultaneously to fully tap the potential of materials and promptly support production and supply the market. The Industrial Equipment Company promptly supplied the cleared steel, scrap iron, and fertilizer to production units; the Municipal Department Store Wholesale Station supplied the cleared elastic thread to the elastic fabric factory, meeting the urgent production needs of the factory. Based on the opinions expressed by the masses and the problems discovered in the warehouse clearing, all units have established and improved management systems, controlled the entry and exit points of warehouses, and mobilized everyone to manage the warehouses well.

    把呆滞物资调上生产前线
    天津成都商业部门清查仓库调剂余缺
    据天津日报消息　天津市商业部门在增产节约运动中，发动职工清理仓库，普查商品库存情况，清理出大批物资，及时供应了工业生产和市场需要。
    清仓工作是当前天津市商业部门增产节约运动的一项重要内容。从市到区县、从批发部门到零售门市部，都认真发动群众，运用大鸣大放、大辩论、大字报的方法，查帐、清仓、盘点，基本上做到了有库必清、形成了群众性的清仓热潮。
    长期积压在仓库里的大批物资被清理了出来。霸县商业部门清理出来六辆小卧车、三十一辆摩托车，还有蒸馏水机、冷热调节器、吊车、电冰箱等。这些物资，有的是农村不需要的，但是在市内却供应不足。河东区新立村人民公社供销部和武清县码头中心商店清理出的十六万斤元钉；静海县积存的六万个电灯泡和大量油毡、木螺丝等，也都是迫切需要的物资。清仓以后，初步改变了某些商品此处积压、彼处不足的现象。
    清理出来的商品，许多已经及时送到最重要、需要最迫切的地方去。交电站电工商店清出三十一种电工器材，其中两千多公斤胶木板供应了天津发电设备厂。和平区商业局所属民用器材公司、百货零售公司等举办了“商品交流会”，在所属各门市部之间调剂清理出来的商品，现在已成交五百四十多笔，价值在七万元以上。积压在各县的许多商品，有些也及时调到市内来供应有关方面的需要。
    许多单位在清仓工作中发现了经营管理工作中的一些缺点，正在研究建立和健全经营管理制度，加以克服。
    本报讯　成都市商业一局所属单位最近发动职工群众全面清理库存商品，彻底核对账货，改善经营管理和财产管理，以便更好地支持生产和进一步安排好市场供应。
    在这次清仓运动中，商业一局系统的局、站、公司和商店、仓库都成立了清仓专门机构。各公司、站同储运公司加强协作配合，划片定点包干，分工合作，在几天内就清查出大批物资。成都市百货批发站清理出有货无账、货到未及时清理转账的商品和未处理的残次商品等共值三十四万元，其中有夏令商品五万四千元，市场急需商品十三万元，共二百多种。工业器材公司在报废的物资中找出一些好的日光灯管和灯泡等。
    在这次清仓工作中，各单位充分地发动了群众，不仅清查出大宗容易发现的商品，还查清了许多历次清仓都未查清的商品。如市百货批发站去年由阿坝调回皮鞋八千多双，由于包装混乱、规格复杂，几次都未查清，压在仓库里不能销售，这次彻底清查了出来，及时供应了市场。通过清仓，许多业务人员还把散存的样品，也清理出来作价处理；部分废次商品、经营不当的商品，也都在清仓中进行了处理。
    在清查仓库工作的同时，商业一局系统各单位还实行了边清仓、边处理、边改进，建立、健全各种管理制度，节约理财、购销调存一齐抓的方法，充分挖掘物资潜力，及时支援生产和供应市场。工业器材公司把清查出来的钢材、废钢铁和肥料等及时供应了生产单位；市百货批发站把清查出来的橡筋线供应了松紧布厂，满足了这个厂的生产急需。根据群众鸣放和在清仓中发现的问题，各单位都建立和健全了管理制度，把住仓库进出关口，发动大家管好仓库。（附图片）
