    "The War of Resistance Against Japan" Symphony
    Li Ling

    Soon after arriving in Shanghai, friends told me that two symphonic works were worth noting: one was Wang Yunjie's "The War of Resistance Against Japan," and the other was "The Butterfly Lovers."

    The vibrant and active scene presented at Shanghai concerts is very exciting. Almost every composer is involved in the creative torrent, contributing their strength to the great leap forward in creation. Even the musicians of the Shanghai Orchestra have written eight or nine symphonic pieces. Among the numerous creations, each has its own merits, but the most distinctive are the two mentioned above. I think the emergence of these two symphonies is indeed a major event in China's symphonic creation.

    "The War of Resistance Against Japan" Symphony is a symphonic piece with a plot. It is an epic describing the War of Resistance. The arrangement of the four movements is: "Resistance," "Memories of Suffering," "To the Enemy's Rear," and "Celebrating Victory." The musical conception is to use revolutionary songs popular among the masses during various periods of the War of Resistance as the central themes of each movement, such as "March of the Volunteers," "On the Songhua River," "Fight to the Enemy's Rear," and "Without the Communist Party, There Would Be No New China," to depict the arduous struggle of the people under the leadership of the Party.

    These materials, after symphonic interpretation in the symphony, are more vivid in imagery. Those who have experienced the War of Resistance or are familiar with the songs of that time may have a deeper understanding of this symphony along the lines of these important themes.

    Although "The War of Resistance Against Japan" Symphony still retains some traces of the author's long-term work in film music scoring, the entire symphony represents a leap forward in development compared to his previous works. In particular, the third movement, which uses Xian Xinghai's "Fight to the Enemy's Rear" as the theme to describe the bravery, wit, and optimism of the anti-Japanese heroes fighting behind enemy lines, is vivid and thorough. The weaving of the fast movement is beautiful and tight, more focused than the other movements.

    Symphony is a time-based auditory (without words) art; an image often needs to appear repeatedly, and the development part is often centered around one or several main themes, expanding on them, to give people a clearer impression. Many parts of the other movements of "The War of Resistance Against Japan" Symphony can grasp this characteristic and highlight the depiction, so the appeal is stronger. However, some parts are suspected of absorbing too much material, and the description is slightly fragmented. If this point is taken into account, and appropriate cuts and expansions are made, the appeal of this symphony will be more concentrated and deepened.

    The second movement of the symphony uses "On the Songhua River" as the material. It is okay to choose such a theme, but attention should be paid to the nature of the emotions embodied in this song. "On the Songhua River" has its own unique features in expressing the displacement of the people of Northeast China at that time, wandering everywhere, and their longing for their hometowns; however, this is only one aspect of the people's feelings at that time. Therefore, it is insufficient in depicting the anger and resistance of the broad masses of people towards the suffering inflicted by Japanese imperialism. It gives people more of an impression of sorrow and weeping. At that time, people loved songs that expressed grief and indignation, such as "Heartache," "Wangjia Village," and "Singing Together," hoping to express their sadness on the one hand and stimulate their courage on the other hand, and it is not unreasonable to feel dissatisfied with "On the Songhua River."

    We cannot force the author to arrange each of his works according to a certain format. However, there should be a deeper study of the nature of a song; of course, the author also paid some attention to this in the symphony (the third movement), giving the audience a feeling of "longing for a happy life" at the end. However, the flame of anger hidden in the depths of sorrow is insufficiently nurtured.

    Ethnic modal-type phrases often appear in the first movement of the symphony (and occasionally in the second and fourth movements); this kind of progression has its own unique effect in certain instrumental music, but in this symphony, it seems weak.

    I love this piece of music, and I hope it will meet the audience with a more profound and rigorous appearance as soon as possible.

### “抗日战争”交　响乐

    “抗日战争”交响乐
    李凌
    刚到上海，朋友们就告诉我：有两首交响乐曲很值得注意，一首是王云阶的“抗日战争”，一首是“梁山伯与祝英台”。
    上海音乐会演中，所呈现的蓬勃、活跃场面是很激动人的，几乎每一个作曲家都卷进了创造洪流，为创作大跃进献出自己的力量。就连上海乐团的演奏员也写了八、九篇交响乐曲，众多的创作中，也各有优点，而最具有特彩的，是上述两曲。我想，这两首交响乐的出现，的确是我国交响乐创作中的一件大事。
    “抗日战争”交响曲，是一首带有情节的交响乐，是描写抗日斗争的史诗，四个乐章的安排是：“抗战”、“苦难的回忆”、“到敌人后方”、“欢庆胜利”。音乐的构思是采用抗战中各个时期在群众中流行的革命歌曲作为各乐章的中心主题，如“义勇军进行曲”、“松花江上”、“打到敌人后方”、“没有共产党就没有新中国”等歌曲的主题加以发挥，来刻划人民在党的领导下进行艰苦的斗争生活。
    这些素材，在交响乐中经过了交响化的阐述，形象性更为鲜明，一些经历过抗日战争的人，或者熟知当时的歌曲的同志，沿着这些重要主题的线路，也可能较深的领会这首交响乐。
    “抗日战争”交响乐中虽然多少还余留着作者长期为电影音乐配音的某些效果性的痕迹，但从整个交响曲来说，比他过去的曲作有跃出的发展，特别是第三乐章，用冼星海的“打到敌人后方”的歌曲作为主题，来描写抗日英雄在敌后的作战的勇敢、机智和乐观的心情，是淋漓尽致的；快速乐章的编织，优美而严紧，比其他乐章更为集中。
    交响乐是一种时间性的听觉（没有文字）艺术；一个意象常常需要反复的出现，发展的部分也常常是围绕着一个或几个主要的主题，加以扩张，才能给人一个比较明确的印象。“抗日战争”交响乐的其他乐章，有许多地方都能掌握这一特点，并加以突出的描绘，因而感染力也较强烈。可是，有些地方就嫌吸取素材过多，描述略嫌零碎，如果这一点加以注意，予以适当的剪裁和扩充，这首交响乐的感染力就会更加集中和加深了。
    交响乐的第二乐章以“松花江上”为素材。选取这样的主题也可以，但要注意这首歌曲所体现的情绪的性质，“松花江上”在表现当时东北人民的流离失所，到处流浪，和对家乡的思念是有其独到之处；但是，这也只是当时人民的一方面的心情，因此它在描画广大人民对日本帝国主义所加给苦难的愤怒和反抗的一面是不足的，它给人是哀怨、哭泣的印象更多一些。当时的人们对于“心头恨”、“王家庄”、“大家唱”表现悲愤的歌曲的热爱，希求从这些歌曲中一方面诉述自己的悲伤，一方面又激发自己的勇气，而对“松花江上”感到不满足，不是没有道理的。
    我们不能强求作者按一定的格式来安排他的每个作业，然而，对于一首歌曲的性质的考察，应该有较深的研究；当然在这一点上，作者也多少在交响乐（第三章）中注意了，结尾部分给了听众“对幸福生活的向往”的感觉。但是，悲伤深处的愤怒火焰是蕴藏得不足的。
    交响乐第一乐章（二、四乐章偶也有之）中常常出现一些民族调式型的乐句；这种进行在某些器乐中有其特有效果，但在这部交响乐中，就显得贫弱了。
    我爱这首乐曲，也愿它早日以更深刻更严谨的面目和听众相见。
