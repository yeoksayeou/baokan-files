This dispatch from Zhangye, May 31st: Commune-run forest farms, an advanced organization for developing forestry production rapidly, efficiently, and economically by relying on the masses, have demonstrated their powerful role in Minqin County, Gansu Province. These 193 commune-run forest farms in the county have not only expanded the communes' production front and increased their income but have also achieved "supporting agriculture with forestry," promoting the simultaneous development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline occupations. Located on the front lines of wind and sand, surrounded on three sides by the Tengger Desert, Minqin County's cultivated land only accounted for 6.1% of the total land area in the early days after liberation, with sand dunes burying large areas of farmland and villages at a rate of three meters per year. After liberation, under the leadership of the Party, the county has planted more than 1.66 million mu of trees and enclosed 48 million mu of sandy land for grass cultivation, increasing the green coverage to 30% of the total land area. The area of young forests and shrubland has reached four times the size of cultivated land. Currently, Minqin County has basically stopped the historical disaster of shifting sand burying villages and farmland. The county's grain yield per mu has increased from several tens of jin in 1949 to 660 jin per mu in 1958, and 420,000 mu of cultivated land has been restored and expanded. Thus, Minqin County's forestry production task has developed from the past defensive measures such as afforestation on the edge of the desert and enclosure of shrubland to a new historical stage of completely eliminating sand damage and utilizing the desert.

The commune-run forest farms in Minqin County have more than 3,500 fixed professional personnel (approximately 3% of the county's total labor force). After communization, except for a few larger forest farms directly managed by the commune, the vast majority of forest farms are managed by the production teams. Facts in the past year have proved that commune-run forest farms are a good organizational form for socialist forestry construction. Commune-run forest farms in Minqin County have the following characteristics: First, in the first few years, on the basis of doing a good job in forestry production, intercropping agricultural crops in young forest land, implementing agroforestry intercropping and grass-wood intercropping. This not only operates forestry but also engages in agriculture; at the same time, it also rationally utilizes shrubland and wild animals, plants and other local products to support forestry with agriculture and sideline occupations. It is estimated that after five years, when the trees grow up and are no longer suitable for intercropping agricultural crops, the income from forestry itself will greatly increase. After the establishment of the county's commune-run forest farms last year, planting millet and vegetables in the forests, plus the income from tree pruning, increased the commune's income by more than 2.15 million yuan. Second, due to the unified planning of the commune, the contradiction between agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry in the use of land has been resolved. In terms of labor, the commune uniformly mobilizes manpower to complete afforestation during the afforestation season; usually, forest farm personnel are responsible for regular seed collection, seedling cultivation, tending, and protection. During the busy summer harvest season, forest farm personnel participate in agricultural production, ensuring that agricultural and forestry production are not delayed. Third, commune-run forest farms are the grassroots organizations of forestry production. Due to dedicated personnel and complete systems, they can achieve careful and meticulous work and consolidate afforestation results. Last year, the survival rate of summer afforestation in the county reached 75%, which was impossible before the establishment of forest farms.

According to the experience of Minqin County, the area of commune-run forest farms should generally be 5,000 to 6,000 mu. The size of the forest farm should not only take into account the ability to green within two or three years, but also meet the needs of diversified operations so that it can be self-sufficient and have a surplus in the short term. If it is too large, it will be difficult to transfer labor at present; if it is too small, diversified operations will be restricted. (Liu Bang)

    社办林场使沙荒变成乐园
    甘肃民勤县由防御沙漠转入进攻沙漠
    以农养林，以林养农，农林牧副并进
    本报张掖31日电　依靠群众、多快好省地发展林业生产的先进组织——社办林场，已经在甘肃省民勤县显示了强有力的作用。这个县的一百九十三个社办林场，不仅扩大了社的生产阵地，增加了社的收入，而且做到“以林养农”，促进了农林牧副一齐发展。处在风沙前线，三面为腾格里沙漠包围的民勤县，解放初期耕地只占总土地面积的6.1％，沙丘以每年前进三公尺的速度埋没了大片农田和村庄。解放后，在党的领导下，几年来全县植树造林一百六十六万多亩，封沙育草四千八百多万亩，绿化面积占总土地面积的30％，幼林和柴湾面积已达到耕地的四倍。目前民勤县基本上制止了流沙埋没村庄和农田的历史性灾害；全县粮食亩产量由1949年的几十斤提高到1958年的亩产六百六十斤，并且恢复和扩大耕地四十二万亩。至此，民勤县的林业生产任务已经由过去的沙边造林和封育柴湾等防御性措施，发展到彻底消灭沙害和利用沙漠的新的历史阶段。
    民勤县的社办林场，固定专业人员三千五百多人（约占全县总劳动力的3％）。公社化以后，除了个别规模较大的林场由公社直接经营外，绝大部分的林场归各生产队经营管理。一年来的事实证明：社办林场是社会主义林业建设的良好组织形式。民勤县的社办林场有以下几个特点：第一，开始的几年，在搞好林业生产的基础上，在幼林地里混种农作物，实行农林间作和草木混种。这样既办了林，又务了农；同时又合理利用柴湾和野生动植物等土特产，以农业和副业来养林。估计五年以后林木长大，不适宜再间种农作物，但林业本身的收益就大大增加了。这个县的社办林场，去年成立以后，在林间种谷子和蔬菜等，加上树木修枝的收益，给公社增加收入二百十五万多元。第二，由于公社统一规划，解决了农林牧业在使用土地上的矛盾。在劳动力方面，造林季节由公社统一调动人力突击完成；平时林场专责人员从事经常性的采种、育苗、抚育和保护等工作；在夏收农忙季节，林场人员就参加农业生产，做到农林生产两不误。第三，社办林场是林业生产的基层组织，由于有专人和完整的制度，能做到精工细作，巩固造林成果。去年这个县夏季造林成活率达到75％，这是未建立林场以前所办不到的。
    根据民勤县的经验，社办林场的面积一般以五千亩到六千亩为宜。林场的大小既要考虑到两三年内能够绿化，又要满足多种经营的需要，使短期内可以自给和盈余。过大目前抽调劳动力有困难；过小又会使多种经营受到限制。（柳梆）
