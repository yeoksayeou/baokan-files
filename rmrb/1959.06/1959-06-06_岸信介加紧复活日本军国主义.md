Observer's Commentary:

    The results of the Japanese House of Councillors election have been announced. Democratic forces in Japan won more than one-third of the seats in this election, dealing another heavy blow to the Nobusuke Kishi government and the Liberal Democratic Party's plot to revise the constitution. As everyone knows, the Nobusuke Kishi government and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party have long attempted to seize more than two-thirds of the seats in this fifth post-war House of Councillors election in Japan in order to revise the current constitution that prohibits Japan from waging war and maintaining war forces. They also sought to create more favorable conditions for approving the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" that would drag Japan into the U.S. atomic strategic system, so as to accelerate Japan's nuclear armament and further militarization. To achieve this goal, in addition to using a massive "election fund" and "political donations" of more than 550 million yen supplied by Japanese monopoly capital to buy votes, the Nobusuke Kishi government and the Liberal Democratic Party also adopted various despicable means to illegally suppress democratic forces and carry out shameless anti-communist propaganda. Under such circumstances, the defeat of the Liberal Democratic Party's plot to manipulate parliament to revise the constitution by Japanese democratic forces is an important achievement. It reflects, to some extent, the progress and strengthening of the unity of Japanese democratic forces. At the same time, it must be pointed out that the actions of the Nobusuke Kishi government and the Liberal Democratic Party in actively following the United States and reviving Japanese militarism will not be relaxed. On the contrary, they will employ more vicious and cruel means to intensify the implementation of their policy of relying on U.S. imperialism to realize Japan's potential imperialist ambitions. Therefore, what lies ahead for the broad masses of the Japanese people and democratic forces will be a series of struggles far more intense than the House of Councillors election struggle.
    Liberal Democratic Party leaders, such as Vice President Ohno and Secretary-General Fukuda, publicly announced after the results of the House of Councillors election were revealed that the Nobusuke Kishi government and the Liberal Democratic Party were prepared to "continue to pursue their past foreign and domestic policies." The various measures taken by the Nobusuke Kishi government recently fully demonstrate that the actions of the Japanese ruling clique to revive Japanese militarism with the help of U.S. power are being intensified step by step.
    First, the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" is being accelerated. Everyone knows that the Nobusuke Kishi government has always wanted to further form an aggressive military alliance with the United States by revising the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," rely on U.S. aid to accelerate the realization of Japan's nuclear armament, and pave the way for Japan to carry out militarist expansion in Asia again. The United States, on the other hand, attempts to rearm Japan and build Japan into a strategic base like West Germany; and to support Japanese militarist forces as pawns for the United States to invade and control the Far East and Asia. The revised Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" not only puts a legal cloak on the long-term occupation of Japan by the U.S. military, making Japan assume more military obligations; but also, under the guise of "strengthening self-defense" and "opposing aggression," stipulates that Japan can carry out nuclear armament, send troops abroad, and cooperate with the U.S. military in combat, pulling chestnuts out of the fire for U.S. aggression in Asia. Not long ago, Nobusuke Kishi openly declared that the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" should be signed at the latest before the end of the extraordinary session of the Japanese Diet scheduled to be held in October this year; and according to Foreign Minister Fujiyama of the Nobusuke Kishi government, they are even striving to sign it before Nobusuke Kishi's visit abroad in July this year. The Kishi group's impatience to revive militarism is evident. In fact, while it is accelerating the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," Japan's nuclear armament is also being accelerated. The plan to produce rocket weapons in Japan has also begun to be implemented. Recently, in order to accelerate nuclear armament centered on the development of missiles equipped with nuclear warheads, the Nobusuke Kishi government decided to purchase a large number of missiles from the United States to arm the Japanese army. Currently, a Japanese military delegation headed by Imai, Vice Minister of the "Defense Agency" of the Kishi government, is in the United States to discuss this issue. According to the plan being drafted by the Kishi government, Japan's military strength will be greatly enhanced, and the "Defense Agency" will be upgraded to the "Ministry of Defense."
    Secondly, the Nobusuke Kishi government, regardless of the Japanese people's desire for peace and neutrality, is stepping up its policy of hostility towards China and other socialist countries. In recent times, although Nobusuke Kishi has repeatedly pretended to open up the deadlock in Sino-Japanese relations in order to win votes, his attitude of hostility towards our country has not only not changed, but has become more rampant and blatant. In addition to following the United States in pursuing the conspiracy to create "two Chinas," Nobusuke Kishi also wantonly slandered and attacked China regarding the suppression of the Tibetan rebellion. It not only used the excuse of "opposing interference in internal affairs" to brazenly reject the Soviet Union's proposal for Japan's peace and neutrality; but also, under the slogan of "recovering the northern territories," conspired to instigate a movement against the Soviet Union. In dealing with the issue of Korean residents in Japan, Nobusuke Kishi carried out various obstructions and sabotage to please the United States and the Syngman Rhee group. He also signed a "war reparations agreement" with the South Vietnamese authorities, regardless of the repeated protests from the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the opposition of the Japanese people.
    In fact, the Nobusuke Kishi government's recent intensification of a series of reactionary policies is not accidental. The Japan-U.S. military alliance policy that it is currently vigorously pursuing is aimed at hostility towards China and aggression against Asian countries. What is noteworthy is that the Nobusuke Kishi government's approach is becoming more and more blatant; it does not even hesitate to nakedly expose its ugly face as a U.S. aggressor's accomplice who is an enemy of the Asian people. In its "Diplomatic Blue Book" published on May 16, the Nobusuke Kishi government for the first time abandoned the three diplomatic principles that it had used for many years to swindle and deceive, namely, "centering on the United Nations," "cooperating with free countries," and the so-called Japan being "a member of Asia"; and openly announced the new three diplomatic principles for taking the road of militarism: "Not allowing [Japan] to adopt a neutral position, strengthening self-defense forces, and establishing a Japan-U.S. security system." This is actually a menacing offensive posture, which shows that Japanese monopoly capital, represented by Nobusuke Kishi, has wholeheartedly relied on U.S. imperialism, the common enemy of the Asian people, in order to realize its potential imperialist ambitions. For this reason, whether it is the Japanese people, the Chinese people, or the Asian people, they cannot but pay attention and be vigilant. Especially within Japan, it can be predicted that in order to implement this policy that runs counter to the interests and wishes of the Japanese people, and in order to maintain its reactionary rule, the Nobusuke Kishi government will mobilize all reactionary forces, further take fascist measures, and suppress the Japanese people's movement. Nobusuke Kishi has recently stated more than once that he will try to pass a series of reactionary bills to "stabilize the Japanese regime," such as the "Anti-Espionage Law" to stifle the people's freedom of speech, and the "Military Secrets Protection Law" to ensure the smooth implementation of rearmament...; and he has threatened to implement a "small constituency system" to suppress the continuous development of democratic forces in elections. At the same time, the activities of the secret police, which trample on basic human rights, are also being strengthened.
    However, no matter how the Nobusuke Kishi government carries out a series of reactionary activities at home, it still cannot suppress the Japanese people's struggle to prevent the revision and demand the abolition of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," and it still cannot overwhelm the Japanese people's call for opening up the deadlock in Sino-Japanese relations. Independence, democracy, peace and neutrality are the aspirations of the Japanese people and are irresistible. The results of this House of Councillors election also reflect this trend. We believe that although the struggle will be more arduous and the road will be more tortuous; but as the reactionary face of the Nobusuke Kishi government is increasingly exposed, and as the awareness of the broad masses of the Japanese people is raised and the unity of democratic forces is strengthened, the Japanese people's struggle for independence, democracy, peace and neutrality will surely achieve greater success.

    岸信介加紧复活日本军国主义
    日本参议院选举结果已经揭晓。日本民主力量在这次选举中获得了超过三分之一的议席，这样就使得岸信介政府和自由民主党企图修改宪法的阴谋遭到又一次沉重的打击。大家知道，岸信介政府和执政的自由民主党久已企图在这次日本战后第五次参议院选举中，攫取三分之二以上的议席，来修改禁止日本作战和保有战争力量的现行宪法，并且企图为批准把日本拖入美国原子战略体系的新的日美“安全条约”创造更有利的条件，以便使日本加速核武装和进一步军国主义化。为了达到这个目的，岸信介政府和自由民主党除了以日本垄断资本供给五亿五千万日元以上的庞大的“选举资金”、“政治献金”大肆收买选票以外，还采取种种卑劣手段非法镇压民主力量和进行无耻的反共宣传。日本民主力量在这样的情况下击溃了自由民主党企图操纵议会修改宪法的阴谋，不能不是一项重要的成就。它在一定程度上反映了日本民主力量的进展和团结的加强。但同时必须指出，岸信介政府和自由民主党积极追随美国、复活日本军国主义的行动，决不会就此放松。相反的，它们将施展更为恶毒和残酷的手段，变本加厉地推行它依靠美帝国主义来实现日本潜在帝国主义野心的政策。因此，展示在日本广大人民和民主力量面前的，将是一系列的较参议院竞选斗争远为激烈的斗争。
    自由民主党的首脑、副总裁大野、干事长福田等，在参议院选举结果揭晓以后，就公开宣布岸信介政府和自由民主党准备
  “继续推行既往的外交和国内政策。”而岸信介政府最近以来采取的种种措施，更充分表明日本统治集团借助美国力量复活日本军国主义的行动，正在步步加紧。
    首先是日美“安全条约”的修订正在加紧进行中。谁都知道，岸信介政府一直想通过修改日美“安全条约”进一步同美国结成侵略性的军事同盟，依靠美国的援助加紧实现日本的核武装，为日本重新在亚洲进行军国主义扩张铺平道路。美国则企图重新武装日本，把日本建成像西德一样的战略基地；扶植日本军国主义势力，作为美国侵略和控制远东和亚洲的打手。修改后的日美“安全条约”，不仅为美军的长期占领日本披上合法的外衣，使日本承担更多的军事义务；而且在“加强自卫”、“反对侵略”等等名词掩盖下，规定日本得以进行核武装、派兵出国，协同美军作战，为美国侵略亚洲的战争火中取栗。不久以前，岸信介公然宣称，新的日美“安全条约”，至迟要在定于今年10月召开的日本国会临时会议结束以前签订；而据岸信介政府的外务相藤山透露，他们甚至争取在今年7月岸信介出国访问以前签字。岸信介集团迫不及待地急于复活军国主义，由此可见，实际上，在它加紧修改日美“安全条约”的同时，日本的核武装也正在加紧进行。在日本生产火箭武器的计划，也已开始执行。最近，岸信介政府为了加速进行以发展装置核弹头的导弹为中心的核武装，决定从美国购买大批导弹来武装日本军队。目前，以岸政府“防卫厅”次官今井为首的日本军事代表团正在美国就这一问题进行商谈。根据岸政府拟订中的计划，日本军事力量将大大增强，“防卫厅”将升格为“国防省”。
    其次是岸信介不顾日本人民的和平中立愿望，加紧推行敌视中国和其他社会主义国家的政策。近些时候，岸信介虽然曾屡次装作打开中日关系僵局的姿态，借以骗取选票；但是他敌视我国的态度非但毫无改变，反而更加猖狂和露骨了。岸信介除了追随美国推行制造“两个中国”的阴谋外，并且就中国平定西藏叛乱事件对中国大肆诬蔑攻击。它既以“反对干涉内政”为借口，悍然拒绝苏联要求日本和平中立的建议；又在“收复北方领土”的口号下，阴谋策动一个反对苏联的运动。在处理旅日朝鲜侨民的问题上，岸信介进行种种阻挠和破坏，向美国和李承晚集团讨好。他并且不顾越南民主共和国的一再抗议和日本人民的反对，同南越当局签订“战争赔偿协定”。
    其实，岸信介政府最近加紧推行一系列的反动政策并不是偶然的。它目前亟力推行的日美军事同盟政策，原就是以敌视中国、侵略亚洲国家为目的的。值得注意的倒是，岸信介政府的做法，正在变得越来越明目张胆；甚至不惜赤裸裸地暴露它与亚洲人民为敌的美国侵略帮凶的狰狞面目。岸信介政府在它5月16日发表的“外交蓝皮书”里，第一次抛开了它多少年来据以招摇撞骗的外交三原则，即“以联合国为中心”，“同自由国家合作”，和所谓日本是“亚洲的一员”；公开宣布走向军国主义道路的新的外交三原则：“不允许（日本）采取中立的立场，加强自卫力量和建立日美安全保障体系”。这实际上是一种张牙舞爪的进攻姿态，它表明以岸信介为代表的日本垄断资本为了实现它潜在的帝国主义野心，已死心塌地投靠亚洲人民共同的敌人美帝国主义。为此，不论是日本人民、中国人民或亚洲人民，都不能不加以注视和警惕。特别是日本国内，可以预计，岸信介政府为了推行它这种与日本人民的利益和愿望背道而驰的政策，为了维持它的反动统治，必将动员一切反动力量、进一步采取法西斯措施，对日本人民运动进行镇压。岸信介最近已不止一次地表示要设法通过一系列的反动法案来“稳定日本的政权”，如扼杀人民言论自由的“防谍法”，保证重整军备顺利实施的“军机保护法”……；并且扬言要实行
  “小选举区制”，以压制民主力量在选举中的不断发展。与此同时，蹂躏基本人权的秘密警察活动也在加强。
    但是，不论岸信介政府将怎样在国内进行一系列的反动活动，它仍然不能镇压日本人民阻止修改和要求废除日美“安全条约”的斗争，仍然无法压倒日本人民要求打开中日关系僵局的呼声。独立、民主、和平中立，是日本民心所向，不可抗拒的。这次参议院选举的结果，也反映了这种趋势。我们相信，尽管斗争将更加艰巨，道路将更加崎岖；但随着岸信介政府反动面目的日益暴露，随着日本广大人民觉悟的提高和民主力量团结的加强，日本人民争取独立、民主、和平中立的斗争，一定会获得更大的成就。
