Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 18th: Our reporter Yuan Dingqian reports: In the process of quelling the rebellion in Tibet, Tibetan farmers in various regions have established hundreds of organizations to manage their own affairs – Rebellion-Quelling Production Committees. These Rebellion-Quelling Production Committees have played a significant role in supporting the People's Liberation Army in quelling the rebellion, leading the vast number of farmers in developing production, and helping farmers overcome difficulties in production and life.

Under the leadership of the military control committee's working groups, the Rebellion-Quelling Production Committees in various regions have led farmers to reclaim wasteland, repair or build new reservoirs and canals, enabling some rural areas, where production was devastated by the cruel exploitation of serf owners and the ravages of the rebel bandits, to gradually recover their vitality. Currently, the crops in the main agricultural areas of Tibet are growing very well. The Rebellion-Quelling Production Committees in various regions are organizing and leading farmers to actively carry out inter-tillage, weeding, watering, and topdressing, striving for a bumper harvest in the first year after quelling the rebellion. On the fertile Lhasa Plain, the land sown this year is much more than in previous years, and the farmers, driven by the Rebellion-Quelling Production Committees, are doing a better job of field management than in the past. Highland barley, wheat, peas, broad beans, etc., are growing lush green, and golden rapeseed flowers are blooming everywhere. The Rebellion-Quelling Production Committee of Suqie Village, Pama Halong, Mozhugongka County, organized the masses to accumulate large amounts of fertilizer such as human and animal manure, wall soil, garbage, and sludge. The farmers in this village are very confident in this year's harvest. In the areas of Xigaze, Gyantse, Shannan, and Tagong, the crops this year are also growing better than in previous years. The farmers in these areas have organized themselves to repair and build canals, pay attention to field management, and constantly struggle against natural disasters. Farmers in the mild climate of Yadong, led by the Rebellion-Quelling Production Committee, organized themselves to build three canals more than 1,000 meters long and dozens of branch canals, overcoming the drought and ensuring that the wheat, which is currently heading and filling, is irrigated in a timely manner.

In the days when the rebellion had just been quelled, the Rebellion-Quelling Production Committees in various regions also actively assisted the military representatives and working groups of the military control committee in publicizing and implementing the policy of "whoever cultivates it, harvests it" to the farmers cultivating the land of the rebel landlords this year. Many farmers, due to the long-term ravages and looting of the rebel bandits, lacked grain, seeds, draft animals, and farm tools, and a large amount of land could not be sown during the spring plowing. The Rebellion-Quelling Production Committees actively helped the military control committee issue interest-free agricultural loans and relief grain, and organized farmers to lend to each other, helping the vast number of farmers overcome difficulties in production and life in a timely manner. For example, the Qiugou Rebellion-Quelling Production Committee in Zela County issued interest-free agricultural loans to more than 60 seed-deficient farmers and provided relief to more than 10 poor farmers within two days of its establishment.

The Lhoba and Monba people in the southern part of the Tagong area, who are still in the late stage of the primitive commune system, have also organized four Rebellion-Quelling Production Committees, enabling the villages ravaged by the rebel bandits to quickly restore peaceful life. People are rebuilding their homes, and the once-abandoned land has once again grown green seedlings.

Under the leadership of the local military control committees and the military representatives of each county (zong), the Rebellion-Quelling Production Committees in various regions have organized the masses to capture hundreds of scattered bandits. As soon as the Rebellion-Quelling Production Committees in various regions of Shannan were established, they took the initiative to report information about the bandits to the troops and lead the way for the troops. At the request of the masses, they organized the masses to transport supplies and ammunition for the troops.

Under the rule of the former Tibetan local government, the vast number of farmers and their children did not have the opportunity to learn culture. As soon as the Rebellion-Quelling Production Committees in some areas were established, the farmers demanded the establishment of primary schools and cultural schools. According to the urgent demands of the masses and local conditions, the working teams of the military control committees have established a number of primary schools together with the Rebellion-Quelling Production Committees. The students of these schools are all children of poor farmers and adopt a method of half-farming and half-study. The Pama Halong Suqie Rebellion-Quelling Production Committee in Mozhugongka County recently established two primary schools, and poor farmers are enthusiastically sending their children to school.

    西藏农民建立平叛生产委员会
    支援平叛　领导生产
    帮助被难同胞重整家园建立新生活
    新华社拉萨18日电　本社记者袁定乾报道：在西藏叛乱平息过程中，西藏各地农民成立了几百个自己管理自己事务的组织——平叛生产委员会。这些平叛生产委员会在支援解放军平息叛乱、带领广大农民搞好生产和帮助农民克服生产、生活上的困难等方面，都起了很大的作用。
    各地平叛生产委员会在军管会工作组的领导下，带领农民开垦荒地，整修或新修水库、水渠，使一些在农奴主残酷剥削和叛匪蹂躏下生产雕敝的农村，逐步恢复了生气。目前，西藏各主要农业区的庄稼都长得很好，各地平叛生产委员会正在组织、带领农民积极进行中耕锄草、浇水追肥，争取平叛后第一年的农业丰收。在富饶的拉萨平原上，今年下种的土地比往年要多得多，而农民们在平叛生产委员会的带动下，田间管理却比过去做得好，青稞、小麦、豌豆、蚕豆等长得一片葱绿，金黄色的油菜花遍地开放。墨竹工卡宗帕马哈龙苏且村的平叛生产委员会，组织群众大量积贮人畜粪、墙土、垃圾、污泥等肥料，这个村的农民对今年的丰收信心很高。日喀则、江孜、山南、塔工等地区，今年的庄稼也比往年长得好，这些地区的农民有组织地整修和兴修了水渠，注意田间管理，与天灾进行不断的斗争。气候温和的亚东地方的农民们，在平叛生产委员会的带领下，组织起来兴修了三条一千多公尺长的水渠和几十条支渠，战胜了天旱，使正在抽穗灌浆的小麦及时得到灌溉。
    在叛乱刚刚平息的那些日子里，各地的平叛生产委员会还积极协助各地军事代表和军管会工作组向耕种叛乱领主土地的农民宣传贯彻在今年实行“谁种谁收”的政策。不少农民由于叛匪长期的蹂躏、劫掠，缺乏粮食、种子和耕畜、农具，有大量土地在春耕时无法下种。平叛生产委员会又积极帮助军管会发放无息农贷和救济粮，并组织农民互相借贷，帮助广大农民及时克服了生产和生活上的困难。如则拉宗秋沟平叛生产委员会在成立后的两天中，就给六十多户缺种农户发放了无息农贷，对十多户贫苦农民进行了救济。
    塔工地区南部还处在原始公社制末期的洛族人和曼族人，也组织了四个平叛生产委员会，使那里遭受叛匪蹂躏的村庄迅速恢复了和平生活，人们重整家业，一度荒废了的土地上又长出了青苗。
    各地的平叛生产委员会在各地军事管制委员会和各宗（县）军事代表的领导下，已经组织群众捕获了成百的散匪。山南各地的平叛生产委员会一成立，就主动向部队报告匪情和为部队带路，并在群众的要求下，组织群众为部队运送物资、弹药。
    在原西藏地方政府统治下，广大农民和他们的子女得不到学习文化的机会。有些地区平叛生产委员会一成立，农民就要求兴办小学和文化学校。各地军管会的工作队根据群众的迫切要求和当地条件，已经和平叛生产委员会一起建立了一批小学，这些学校的学生都是贫苦农民的子弟，采取半耕半读的方法进行学习。墨竹工卡宗帕马哈龙苏且平叛生产委员会最近就兴办了两所小学，贫苦农民都踊跃送子女入学。
