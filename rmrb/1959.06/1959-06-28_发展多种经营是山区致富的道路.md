Developing Diversified Economy is the Road to Prosperity for Mountainous Areas
中共湄潭县委会 (CPC Meitan County Committee)

Meitan County is located in northeastern Guizhou. The county has a population of 611,967 people and covers an area of 6,000 square kilometers. Cultivated land amounts to over 1.2 million mu, accounting for about 13.3% of the total area. The terrain is half high mountains and ridges, and half undulating low mountains and hills, interspersed with small basins. The county has a mild climate, abundant rainfall, no severe winters, and no scorching summers. The soil is fertile and rich in products. In addition to self-sufficiency in grain, there is a surplus for outward transfer. Agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries are all present. In 1958, the county operated 805 types of cash crops and local specialties. The main products include tea, flue-cured tobacco, silkworm cocoons, pigs, timber, Chinese medicinal herbs, white fungus, tung oil, Phoebe nanmu, lacquer, wax, and fruits.

Most of these cash crops and local specialties have a long history of production. Sericulture and tea cultivation, for example, have a history of over a thousand years. Before liberation, due to the stagnation of the country's overall economic life, coupled with speculation and monopoly by merchants, farmers rarely benefited. Therefore, the production of these cash crops and local specialties developed very little. Take tea as an example: until the liberation of Meitan, the tea garden area was only over 7,000 mu, with a maximum annual output of 700 dan, and the quality was low, lacking credibility in the market. During the Kuomintang rule, even merchants found it difficult to operate. The purchase of local specialties was entirely controlled by gangsters colluding with the Kuomintang army. Farmers not only could not obtain normal profits but also often faced disaster. The production of cash crops and local specialties, which had already seen little development, was further damaged. Sericulture, with its thousand-year history, was almost extinct before liberation.

After liberation, the comprehensive development of the national economy opened up broad avenues for diversified production in mountainous areas, and directly supported this production with funds and technology. In just a few years, loans for silkworm cocoons alone reached 500,000 yuan. To effectively develop tea and medicinal herb production, the state established a tea experiment station and a state-owned medicinal herb farm here, training a large number of technical personnel for various productions. All these measures have promoted the increasing vitality of production in mountainous areas. By 1958, the output value of cash crops and local specialties in the county reached 64.7% of the total agricultural output value. The output value of several major cash crops such as tea, silkworm cocoons, pigs, timber, and flue-cured tobacco in 1958 was equal to 299.77% of that in 1949.

From these figures, it can be seen that the growth rate of production in these areas has been considerable in the years since liberation. For example, the tea garden area in 1958 reached 42,000 mu, six times the 7,000 mu at the time of liberation, and the tea output reached 3,300 dan, nearly five times that of 1949. The quality of tea has also improved rapidly. The best Meijiang tea produced here can now be compared with Hangzhou's first-class Longjing tea. The black tea processed by the Meijiang Tea Farm was sold abroad for the first time last year under the "Qianhong" brand, reaching the special grade standard for export. Pig production in 1949 was more than 122,000 heads, and in 1958 it reached more than 643,000 heads.

The increasing vitality of cash crops and local specialties production in mountainous areas is in line with the interests of the country and represents an aspect of the country's thriving economic life. Most of these products are best-selling goods in the market, and more than 60% of them are export commodities. Therefore, it not only supplies domestic market needs but also earns a large amount of foreign exchange for the country. From 1953 to 1958, the 4,778 dan of black tea exported by the county could be exchanged for 38,000 tons of steel. One ton of Baishao (white peony root) can be exchanged for 32 tons of steel. Last year alone, the county purchased 700 tons of Baishao. Developing production in this area is also in line with the immediate interests of farmers. People's communes, production teams, and commune members engaged in this type of production have seen a significant increase in income. In areas where production in this area has been well-developed, the improvement in people's lives is even more significant. For example, Maoping District, located in continuous high mountains, used to be the poorest area in the county. Before liberation, farmers in Maoping District had three major markers when entering Meitan County: dark skin (unsanitary), tattered clothes, and palm bark-wrapped feet. Since 1954, this area has vigorously developed pig, flue-cured tobacco, and timber production, and the economic situation of the entire district has undergone fundamental changes. Now, farmers in Maoping District have three new markers when attending meetings in the county: flashlights, pens, and sneakers. Since 1956, the average deposit per household in the entire district has reached 20 yuan. Another example is a small team of 12 households in the Juelin Management District of Songyan Commune, who all lived in thatched houses in the past. They took out loans every year before 1956, and the living loans in 1956 alone reached 789 yuan. In 1957, they began raising pigs in large numbers, averaging more than 19 heads per household. Now, all of them have moved into new tile-roofed houses. Not only have all the loans been repaid, but they have also become depositors, with a total deposit of more than 600 yuan.

Meitan County's natural conditions have enormous potential for developing a diversified economy. The county has approximately 1.4 million mu of barren hills and wild forests suitable for planting tea trees, but currently, there are only 42,000 mu of tea gardens. The county's timber harvestable volume reaches more than 900,000 cubic meters, but currently, only 140,000 cubic meters are harvested. The county has 600,000 mu of Quercus variabilis forests suitable for raising tussah silkworms, but the area utilized is less than half. Other tung oil, Phoebe nanmu, lacquer, wax, Chinese gall, wild medicinal materials, etc. are only utilized to about 60%. Most of these crops do not compete with grain for land. Tea trees, Quercus variabilis, and fruit trees all prefer acidic soil, and barren hills and steep slopes are originally the home of these crops. Therefore, from the perspective of land potential, vigorously developing cash crops and local specialties production will not affect grain production.

The development of Meitan County's diversified economy and local specialties production has received strong support from the state and has also been actively supported by the masses. There is also enormous potential in natural conditions. Leaders at all levels in the county have also accumulated some experience in several years of practice, laid a certain production foundation, and trained a certain technical force. In short, the important conditions required for developing production in this area are basically in place. Based on these favorable conditions, the needs of the country, and the preliminary plans of various communes and teams, the county party committee has formulated a diversified economic production plan for 1959, with grain and oil first, followed by tea, silkworm, pigs, and flue-cured tobacco as the main focus. The output value of cash crops and local specialties is planned to reach 130 million yuan, 152% of that in 1958.

From the current situation, the most critical issue in completing this plan is the arrangement of labor.

Cash crops are generally more labor-intensive and technically demanding, and some even conflict with the busy season for grain. For example, based on this year's production plan and the labor efficiency of previous years, the labor shortage accounts for about 30% of the total labor force. The most effective way to solve the labor shortage is to launch a tool reform movement and improve labor productivity. Currently, the county has launched a mass tool reform movement not only in grain production but also in various crop productions, which has achieved good results. The county has created, imitated, and reformed more than 210,000 various tools, with an average efficiency increase of 30%-40%. The tea kneading machine and tea drying room in Xinglong Commune increased efficiency by nearly ten times, saving 9,600 workdays for other productions. Improving production management, establishing a strict production responsibility system, and rationally arranging the use of labor can not only enable the old and weak labor force to do what they are capable of and undertake the work they can handle, but also often enable semi-labor force to play the role of a full labor force. Establishing appropriate production bases and specialized production teams, and rapidly improving the technical level of specialized teams and training technical personnel through on-site meetings, short-term training classes, and master-apprentice methods, are important measures to improve labor efficiency and do a good job in production, and will inevitably achieve the goal of saving labor. These measures can save labor to a certain extent and alleviate the labor shortage, but it is still difficult to completely solve the problem of labor shortage within the year. Therefore, the county party committee proposed that all communes, management districts, and production teams should carefully calculate labor when arranging plans, emphasizing that cash crops and local specialties production must be developed on the premise of not affecting grain production. Otherwise, they will lose sight of the other, and when labor is tight, it will affect the normal progress of the entire production, resulting in being eager for quick success and failing to achieve it. Currently, the plans determined by various communes, management districts, and production teams are generally based on the principle of "doing a good job in grain production, vigorously developing animal husbandry production, and focusing on doing a good job in one or two cash crops and local specialties production based on the characteristics of the region and various conditions." For example, Fengyan Commune, located in high mountains, has dozens of miles of continuous Quercus variabilis forests and decades of experience in producing white fungus, so it plans to focus on the production of white fungus and tussah silkworms. Yuqing Commune has always had fewer sideline occupations in the past, but it produces Huangguo fruit, which is famous throughout the province, and sells a large number of fruit seedlings every year, so it plans to focus on fruit production, expanding orchards, and breeding a large number of seedlings. Xinglong Commune has continuous tea hills, so it plans to focus on tea production. Meijiang and Huangjiaba Communes have a history of hundreds of years of producing medicinal materials, so they mainly focus on medicinal materials production. However, various communes, management districts, and production teams should also include small-scale productions that can be carried out, especially the collection of wild plants, in the plan, and have dedicated personnel responsible for them, so as to achieve both a focus and the simultaneous development of a diversified economy.

    发展多种经营是山区致富的道路
    中共湄潭县委会
    湄潭县位于贵州东北部。全县人口六十一万一千九百六十七人。纵横面积六千平方公里。现有耕地一百二十余万亩，约占总面积的13.3％。境内半是高山峻岭，半是起伏的低山和丘陵，间有块块小盆地。全县气候温和，雨量充沛，冬无严寒，夏无酷热。土地肥沃，物产丰富。粮食除自给外，尚有外调。农、林、牧、副、渔无一不有，全县1958年经营的经济作物与土特产共八百零五种，主要产品有茶叶、烤烟、蚕茧、生猪、木材、中药材、银耳、桐、棬、漆、蜡以及水果等。
    这些经济作物与土特产，在历史上多数早有生产，像桑蚕、茶叶已有千年以上的悠久历史。解放以前，由于国家整个经济生活的停滞不前，加以商人投机垄断，农民很少得益。因此这些经济作物和土特产生产很少发展。拿茶叶来说，直到湄潭解放，茶园面积才不过七千亩，最高年产量七百担，而且质量低下，在市场上没有信誉。在国民党统治时期，连商人也难以经营。收购土特产全部由流氓勾结国民党军队把持，农民不仅不能得到正常利益，反而常常招致祸端。很少发展的经济作物和土特产生产又遭到破坏。有上千年历史的桑蚕生产，在解放前几乎断种绝迹。
    解放以后，国家经济生活的全面发展，给山区的多种生产开辟了广阔道路，而且直接以资金和技术力量扶助了这方面生产。几年里，只是蚕茧贷款就达五十万元。为了有效的发展茶叶和药材生产，国家在这里成立了茶叶试验站和国营药材场，为各项生产培训了大量技术人才。所有这些措施，都促使山区生产日趋活跃。到1958年全县经济作物与土特产生产产值达到农业总产值的64.7％。茶叶、蚕茧、生猪、木材、烤烟等几种主要经济作物产品，1958年的产值等于1949年的299.77％。
    从这些数字可以看出，解放几年来，这些方面生产增长幅度是相当大的。例如茶园面积1958年已达四万二千亩，为解放时七千亩的六倍，茶叶产量达三千三百担，将近1949年的五倍。茶叶质量也有迅速提高，这里生产的最好湄江茶，已可与杭州一级龙井媲美。经湄江茶场加工的红茶，去年首次以黔红牌子出售国外，达到外销品级的特级标准。生猪生产1949年为十二万二千多头，1958年达到六十四万三千多头。
    山区经济作物与土特产生产的日趋活跃，符合于国家利益，表现了国家经济生活蒸蒸日上的一个方面。这些产品，大部分都是市场上的畅销货，其中有60％以上是出口商品。因此，它既供应了国内市场需要，又给国家换回大量外汇。从1953年到1958年全县出口的四千七百七十八担红茶，可换回钢材三万八千吨。一吨白芍可换三十二吨钢材，只去年全县就收购了七百吨白芍。发展这方面的生产，也符合农民切身利益，经营这方面生产的人民公社、生产队、社员，收入都有显著增加。在这方面生产开展得好的地区，人民生活的提高更其显著。如处于高山连绵的茅坪区，原是全县最贫困的地区。解放前茅坪区农民进湄潭县城有三大标记：人黑（不卫生）、衣服破烂、棕片包脚。从1954年起，这个地区大力发展生猪、烤烟和林木生产，全区经济情况起了根本变化。现在茅坪区的农民到县开会，有三个新标记：电筒、钢笔和球鞋。全区从1956年每户平均存款就达二十元。再如松烟公社觉林管理区一个小队，共十二户，过去全是茅草房。1956年以前年年贷款，只1956年的生活贷款就达七百八十九元。1957年开始大量养猪，平均每户达十九头多。现在全部换了新瓦房。不仅贷款全部还清，还都成了存款户，共存六百多元。
    湄潭县自然条件，有着发展多种经济巨大的潜力。全县适宜栽植茶林的荒山野林面积约一百四十万亩，目前茶园才只四万二千亩。全县木材可采伐量达九十多万立方公尺，目前只采伐十四万立方公尺。全县可养柞蚕的青杠林六十万亩，目前利用面积不及一半，其他桐、棬、漆、蜡、五棓子、野生药材等只利用到60％左右。这些作物中的绝大部分都不与粮争地，茶树、青杠、果树都喜酸性土壤，而且荒山陡坡原就是这些作物的家乡。因此，从土地潜力来看，大力发展经济作物与土特产生产，可以不影响粮食生产。
    湄潭县的多种经济与土特产生产的发展，既得到国家的大力扶助，也得到群众的积极拥护，自然条件上又存在着巨大的潜力，全县各级领导在几年实践中也积累了一些经验，打下了一定的生产基础，培训了一定的技术力量，总之，发展这方面生产所需的重要条件都基本具备了。县委根据这些有利条件，根据国家的需要，根据各社、队的初步计划，拟定了1959年首先以粮、油，其次以茶、蚕、生猪、烤烟为主的多种经济的生产计划。经济作物与土特产的产值，计划达到一亿三千万元，为1958年的152％。
    从目前情况看，完成这个计划最关键的问题是劳动力的安排。
    经济作物一般都比较费工，技术性也强，有一些还与粮食的忙季冲突。如以今年生产计划与往年劳动效率相衡，所差劳动力约占总劳动力的30％。解决劳力不足的最有效办法是开展工具改革运动，提高劳动生产率。目前全县不仅在粮食生产方面，而且在各种作物生产方面，都开展了群众性的工具改革运动，收到了很好的效果，全县创制、仿制、改制的各种工具有二十一万多件，平均工效提高30％—40％。兴隆公社的揉茶机、烘茶房提高工效近十倍，能节约出九千六百个劳动日投入其他生产。改善生产管理，建立严格的生产责任制，合理安排使用劳动力，不仅能使老、弱劳动力各得其所，担负他们所能胜任的工作，而且还往往能使半劳力发挥整劳力的作用。建立适当的生产基地与专业生产队，通过现场会议、短期训练班、师傅带徒弟等办法，迅速提高专业队技术水平，培训技术人才，是提高劳动效率、搞好生产的重要措施，也必然达到节约劳动力的目的。以上这些措施，都能在一定程度上节约劳动力，缓和劳动力紧张情况，但要在年内完全解决劳动力不足问题，尚有困难。因此，县委提出要各公社、各管理区、各生产队安排计划时，都周密计算劳动力，强调必须作到在不影响粮食生产的前提下，发展经济作物和土特产生产。否则，将会顾此失彼，在劳动力紧张时，影响整个生产的正常进行，结果欲速而不达。目前各公社、管理区、生产队确定计划，大体上都是根据“搞好粮食生产，大力开展畜牧业生产外，根据本地区的特点和各方面条件，着重搞好一两种经济作物和土特产生产”原则确定的。如地处高山的丰岩公社，有绵延数十里的青杠林，和数十年生产银耳的经验，就计划主要搞银耳和柞蚕两项生产。余庆公社过去一向副业较少，但它却出产闻名全省的黄果，而且每年都出售大量果苗，就计划主要搞水果生产，扩大果林、大量育苗。兴隆公社茶山连绵，就计划主要搞茶叶生产。湄江和黄家坝公社有数百年生产药材的历史，就主要搞药材生产。不过，各公社、管理区和生产队，对有条件搞的小宗生产，特别是对野生植物的采集，也要列入计划，并且有专人负责。以作到既有重点，又能使多种经济同时发展。
