    Fly Swatter
    "Here's scrap iron for you!" Cui Zhuo, a twelve-year-old Young Pioneer from the staff and workers' children's school of the Ministry of Construction Engineering, turned to leave after handing a pile of scrap iron to the cooperative's purchasing agent. "Hey, don't go!" The purchasing agent called out to Cui Zhuo while weighing the scrap iron. He calculated the amount and handed the money to Cui Zhuo, but Cui Zhuo refused, saying:
  "Doesn't the country need scrap iron? I picked it up for the country, why should you give me money?" He was about to leave again. The cooperative's purchasing agent stopped him again and explained that giving money for scrap is a national regulation. Only then did Cui Zhuo reluctantly accept the money.
    What to do with the money? "That's right, aren't we eliminating the four pests now?" So he ran to the cooperative, bought three fly swatters, and handed them, along with the remaining two jiao and some change, to the person in charge of the dormitory family committee. From then on, fly swatters appeared at the entrances of the stairwells in the dormitory building where Cui Zhuo lived.

    苍蝇拍
    “给你们废铁！”建筑工程部职工子弟小学十二岁的少先队员崔卓，把一堆废铁交给合作社的收购员后，扭头就往回走了。“喂，别走！”收购员一边叫住崔卓，一边称废铁。他计算了一下，然后把钱交给崔卓，可是崔卓却拒绝说：
  “国家不是需要废铁吗？我是拣来给国家的，干吗要给我钱？”他又准备走了。合作社收购员又叫住了他，向他解释了交废品给钱是国家的规定，崔卓才勉强收了钱。
    钱，怎么处理它呢？“对了，现在不是要除四害吗？”于是他跑到合作社买了三个苍蝇拍，连同剩余的二角多钱一起交给了宿舍家属委员会的负责人。从此，崔卓住的宿舍大楼的楼梯口就出现了苍蝇拍。
