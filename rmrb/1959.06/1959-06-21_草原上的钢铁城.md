    Steel City on the Grassland

    The car sped along the Kungnais River on the boundless grassland, the slowly moving flocks of sheep were quietly grazing, like white clouds floating in a green ocean. After crossing several snow-capped valleys, a fiery battle scene suddenly appeared before our eyes. A long row of hot blast stoves and iron smelting furnaces billowed with thick smoke; vehicles transporting ore and equipment shuttled back and forth; the sound of blasting and machinery from the mountain mines broke the silence on the grassland. This is the newly emerging steel city of the Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture - the Xinyuan Steel Plant. Three small blast furnaces have already been built here, and this year another three 28-cubic-meter small blast furnaces, as well as steelmaking and rolling workshops, will be built. More than 500 Kazakh herdsmen, Uyghur farmers, and Han Chinese cadres sent to lower levels have become skilled steelworkers.

    Half a year ago, this was still pastureland for grazing cattle and sheep. The steel needed by the people of the Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture was all transported from other places. Now, the pig iron produced here has already met the needs of agricultural and pastoral production in the entire autonomous prefecture. Comrade Qin Shusheng, Secretary of the Party Committee of the plant, told us: This year, all employees of the plant are determined to produce 27,000 tons of iron, 5,000 tons of steel, and 2,000 tons of steel products, to quickly change the backwardness of steel production in the autonomous prefecture.

    The emergence of a steel city on the peaceful grassland for thousands of years is already exciting enough, but even more surprising are the people who have tamed these small blast furnaces. Some of them are Kazakhs who have just put down their herding whips, some are Uyghur farmers who have just put down their adzes, and some are Han Chinese cadres sent to lower levels. Originally, they knew nothing about iron smelting. When they first came here last winter, they dug some dugouts and built a few tents on the snow-covered grassland to settle down and smelt batch after batch of molten iron. Not long ago, the No. 2 8-cubic-meter small blast furnace achieved a high-yield record of 16.582 tons of pig iron per day, with a utilization coefficient of 2.063, winning the first red flag in the entire Xinjiang.

    When we arrived at this small blast furnace, molten iron was gushing out of the furnace opening, sparks were flying everywhere, and the Kazakh lads operating in front of the furnace were all sweating profusely, looking like little tigers fighting the raging fire. Comrade Pan Shanying, the furnace chief, forcefully opened the tap hole and turned around to tell us that their furnace was steadily rising, advancing towards higher daily production targets.

    草原上的钢铁城
    汽车沿着巩乃斯河在无边无尽的草原上奔驰，缓缓移动着的羊群在静静地啮草，有如绿色的海洋里飘浮着朵朵的白云。翻过几座白雪皑皑的山谷，一片火炽般的战斗场面突然出现在眼前。一长排热风炉、炼铁炉，冒着滚滚浓烟；拉运矿石、器材的车辆穿梭奔驰；山上采矿的爆破声和机器的轰响，打破了草原上的寂静。这就是伊犁哈萨克族自治州新兴的钢铁城——新源钢铁厂。这里已经建起了三座小高炉，今年还要再建三座二十八立方的小高炉和炼钢车间、轧钢车间，五百多名哈萨克牧人、维吾尔农民和汉族下放干部变成了熟练的钢铁工人。
    半年前，这里还是牧放牛羊的草场，伊犁哈萨克族自治州人民所需要的钢铁，还都是从外地调运来的。现在，这里生产的生铁已经供应了全自治州农牧业生产的需要。厂党委书记秦述圣同志告诉我们说：今年，全厂职工决心生产铁两万七千吨，钢五千吨，钢材两千吨，迅速改变自治州钢铁生产的落后面貌。
    几千年来平静的草原涌现了钢铁城，这就已经够令人兴奋了，但更令人惊喜的是驯服这些小高炉的人们。他们有的是刚放下牧羊鞭子的哈萨克人，有的是刚放下砍土镘的维吾尔农民，有的是下放的汉族干部，原来对于炼铁全都不懂，去年冬天一来到这里，就在风雪漫天的草原上挖了些地窝子，搭了几座帐篷安居下来，炼出了一炉炉铁水。前不久，二号八立方小高炉以日产生铁十六吨五百八十二公斤，利用系数达到二点零六三的高产纪录，夺得了全新疆第一面红旗。
    当我们来到这座小高炉旁的时候，铁水正从炉口奔腾而出，火花四溅，在炉前操作的几个哈萨克小伙子，个个汗流浃背，活像一只只与烈火搏斗的小老虎。炉长潘山英同志，猛力地?开出铁口以后，转回身告诉我们说，他们的炉子正在步步高升，向更高的日产指标跃进。
