According to Anhui Daily, Majian People's Commune in Fuyang County, Anhui Province, has seen a great development in livestock and poultry production since this spring. Including both collectively raised and privately raised animals, the average household now has 2.1 pigs, 2.3 sheep, 7.7 chickens, and 1.6 rabbits. The Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has called on all parts of the province to seriously study the experience of the Majian People's Commune, implement the policy of simultaneously promoting public and private raising, and effectively help all breeding units and commune members to solve specific problems such as breeding stock, feed, labor arrangements, fertilizer treatment, and disease prevention, so that livestock and poultry production can also achieve significant results like agricultural production.

The Majian People's Commune in Fuyang County, due to its firm implementation of the policy of simultaneously promoting collective and individual breeding, has mobilized the enthusiasm of commune organizations at all levels and commune members. At the same time, it has properly overcome various specific difficulties, and since this spring, livestock and poultry breeding has been rapid and management has been very good. The commune now has 31,500 pigs, an increase of more than 10,000 compared with the same period last year. Among them are 13,500 sows, 294 boars, 6,300 fattening pigs, and 11,406 piglets. The commune now has 33,548 sheep, 23,584 rabbits, and more than 113,000 chickens. Of the more than 30,000 pigs in the commune, units above the brigade level (including township-level organizations and groups) raised 18,014, production teams and canteens raised 7,151, and commune members raised 6,335.

In order to promote the great development of livestock and poultry, the commune has seriously adopted various measures to solve problems such as pig sources, feed, fertilizer, labor, and epidemic prevention.

Actively expand pig sources. They adopted two methods: one is to promote advanced experiences such as double mating and re-mating to increase the farrowing rate of sows; the other is to prohibit the castration of sows and retain all female piglets as breeding sows. Each brigade has built pig farms with boars to supply piglets to commune members for raising.

Greatly increase feed. Collective pig farms in this commune have feed bases for growing feed. Commune members also used spare land to grow large quantities of feed such as sweet potatoes, pumpkins, carrots, and alfalfa. At the same time, they actively found more than 150 kinds of wild feed from trees, water, wild vegetables, and wild grass. Now, in this commune, whether elderly people, women, or children, all carry baskets when they go out, collecting wild vegetables and finding feed along the way.

Reasonably handle the fertilizer accumulated from pig raising. They adopted the following two methods: (1) Fertilizer is handed over to the team according to a certain proportion. Of the fertilizer accumulated by collective pig raising, 85% is handed over to the team for unified use, and 15% is retained for fertilizer for self-cultivated feed land. Of the fertilizer accumulated by individual commune members raising pigs, 90% is handed over to the team and 10% is retained for self-use. (2) All fertilizer is handed over to the team and allocated by the team in a unified manner. For example, the Liuqiao Production Team stipulates that one mu of feed land receives four large carts (about 1,600 jin per cart), allocated twice in spring and autumn. The fertilizer handed over to the team for use is priced according to quality, and cash is paid or settled after the autumn harvest.

Adjust and save labor. In addition to arranging a certain amount of labor for pig raising, they also attach great importance to reforming feeding tools, improving feeding efficiency, and saving feeding personnel. Taoyuan and Majian Brigades have both tried using pipelines to deliver water instead of manual carrying, and using overhead cableways and ground tracks to deliver food instead of manual carrying. Wood barrels are added to the cooking pots to cook more feed. The two production teams in Majian Brigade, which did a good job in tool reform, raised more than 300 pigs. Originally, there were 38 feeders, but now only 15 feeders are needed, saving 60% of labor.

Carry out epidemic prevention work. The commune established a pharmaceutical factory and a veterinary hospital, and the brigade established epidemic prevention stations, equipped with 55 epidemic prevention personnel, who regularly inspect the epidemic prevention situation of livestock and poultry and carry out epidemic prevention injections. In feeding management, attention is also paid to the cleanliness of feed and pig houses. Lime water is sprayed for disinfection every three days, a sick pig isolation room is established, and sick pigs are immediately isolated, which greatly reduces the mortality rate of pigs. Since last year, the goal of a disease-free and plague-free commune has been basically achieved.

Guixi, This Newspaper, 14th. Commercial departments in Guixi County, Jiangxi Province, closely cooperate with agricultural departments to vigorously support people's communes in developing livestock, poultry, and fish production in terms of purchase, sales, and allocation, opening up avenues for communes to increase income and opening up more sources of meat for the country.

At present, not only are the plans for livestock, poultry, and fish production in the county implemented and universally reaching communes, teams, and households, but also development is very rapid. According to statistics at the end of May, the number of pigs in the county has reached more than 110,000, accounting for more than 61% of the annual development plan; the number of plowing cattle has reached more than 25,000, accounting for more than 80% of the annual development plan; and the number of poultry such as chickens, ducks, and geese has reached 300,000, accounting for about 50% of the annual development plan; in addition to retaining 2.8 million fish in ponds, 3.8 million small fish fry have been newly stocked. With the rapid development of livestock and poultry, the county's purchase of pork, fresh eggs, fish, and other items has also progressed rapidly, providing a large amount of meat for urban factories and mines. As of May 17, the county had transferred more than 1,000 pigs out of the area, exceeding the second quarter's pig transfer task 48 days ahead of schedule; it also transferred more than 1,200 jin of fresh eggs in a timely manner and caught more than 180,000 dan of fresh fish.

Since the beginning of this year, all people's communes in the county, in accordance with the policy of "equal emphasis on public and private raising," have vigorously developed meat production such as livestock, poultry, and fish. They are required to achieve one cow per two laborers; two pigs per household; two to three chickens per person; and all water surfaces stocked with fish. However, in the process of development, some difficulties have been encountered, mainly the lack of piglets, hatching eggs, and fish fry, and uneven surplus and shortage; insufficient feed; and lack of funds for private raising by some commune members. Under the unified leadership of the Party committee, the commercial departments took the initiative to strengthen cooperation with the agricultural departments and vigorously supported the people's communes and commune members in overcoming difficulties. The County Commercial Bureau and the Agricultural Bureau jointly formed a county-wide livestock production office to exchange information, act in a unified manner, and guide livestock production; commercial departments at all levels strengthened specific organizational work according to local conditions and problems.

First, pre-purchase activities were strengthened. The county's commercial departments specially transferred more than 100 commercial employees to go deep into the people's communes to sign pre-purchase contracts with various communes and production brigades, and issued more than 80,000 yuan in interest-free deposits for livestock, poultry, and fish production. By signing contracts and issuing deposits, not only did they help the people's communes and commune members solve financial difficulties and stimulate the enthusiasm of commune members to develop livestock, poultry, and other production, but they also fully implemented the county's livestock, poultry, and fish production plans. For example, with the support of the commercial departments, the Jin Gang Brigade of the Sili Commune raised an average of two pigs per household and five to ten chickens, with as many as 19 livestock and poultry breeding projects.

While carrying out pre-purchase activities, the commercial departments took the initiative to organize the transfer of surpluses and shortages of piglets, hatching eggs, and fish fry. The county specially set up piglet and other transfer markets in Guixi and Yingtan, where the commercial departments uniformly purchased and sold them; in terms of price, they insisted on the original price in and the original price out. State-owned stores in various people's communes purchased and sold locally, responsible for internal transfers within the commune. As a result, the county transferred more than 10,000 piglets, overcoming the difficulty of a shortage of piglets. Other items such as hatching eggs and fish fry were also transferred and made up for surpluses and shortages through the unified purchase and sale of commercial departments.

The county's commercial departments opened up feed sources from both inside and outside the county. They linked up with vegetable cooperatives and communes in the county, uniformly purchased vegetables of poor quality and wild plants, and then uniformly sold them to feedlots and commune members in various places; they purchased a batch of feed from other provinces and counties and supplied it within the county. For example, the commercial departments purchased more than 8,000 jin of water hyacinth seedlings from Guangdong, which can be used as pig feed, and supplied them to feedlots and commune members for breeding in ponds. The quantity was large and the quality was good, making it one of the main feeds for pigs in the county.

The commercial departments are summarizing the work of the previous stage and preparing to strengthen technical guidance on feeding work to prevent diseases in young livestock and poultry and ensure that the survival rate reaches the expected goal, and further develop livestock, poultry, and fish production.

    安徽推广发展家畜家禽生产的好榜样
    马店公社猪羊满圈鸡兔成群
    平均每户已有猪两头多，羊两只多，鸡七只多，兔一只多
    江西贵溪县商业部门千方百计支持公社繁殖家畜家禽
    据安徽日报消息　安徽省阜阳县马店人民公社今春以来家畜家禽大发展，包括集体饲养和个人饲养的在内，平均每户已有猪二点一头、羊二点三只、鸡七点七只、兔一点六只。中共安徽省委号召全省各地认真学习马店人民公社的经验，贯彻公养和私养同时并举的方针，切实地帮助各个饲养单位和社员个人解决种源、饲料、劳力安排、肥料处理、防止病疫等具体问题，使家畜家禽生产也能够像农业生产一样获得显著成绩。
    阜阳县马店人民公社由于坚决贯彻了集体饲养和个人饲养同时并举的方针，调动了公社各级组织和社员的积极性，同时妥善地克服了各种具体困难，今春以来，家畜家禽繁殖很快，管理很好。全社现有猪三万一千五百头，比去年同期增加一万多头。其中母猪一万三千五百头，公猪二百九十四头，菜猪六千三百头，仔猪一万一千四百零六头。全社现有羊三万三千五百四十八只，兔子二万三千五百八十四只，鸡十一万三千多只。在全社现有的三万多头猪中，大队以上单位（包括乡级机关、团体）养了一万八千零一十四头，生产队和食堂养了七千一百五十一头，社员个人养了六千三百三十五头。
    为了促进家畜家禽大发展，这个公社认真地采取了各种措施，解决猪源、饲料、肥料、劳力、防疫等问题。
    积极开辟猪源。他们采取了两种办法：一是推广双重交配和复配等先进经验，提高母猪产仔率；另一种是禁止阉割母猪，把仔母猪全部保留作为母种猪。每个大队都建有养猪场，养有种猪，把繁殖的仔猪供给社员饲养。
    大力增加饲料。这个社的集体养猪场都有饲料基地种植饲料，社员并利用空隙地大量种植了红芋、南瓜、胡萝卜、苜蓿等饲料。同时还积极从树上、水里、野菜、野草中找到了一百五十多种野生饲料。现在，这个社，无论是老年人，还是妇女、小孩，出门都带上篮子，沿途拔野菜找饲料。
    合理处理养猪所积的肥料。他们采取以下两种办法：（一）肥料按比例交队。集体养猪所积的肥料，85％交队统一使用，15％留作自种饲料地的肥料。社员个人养猪积的肥料，90％交队，10％留作自用。（二）肥料全部交队，由队统一拨给。例如刘桥生产队规定一亩饲料地给四大车（每车约一千六百斤），春秋两次分配。对交队使用的肥料按质作价，付给现金或秋后结算。
    调整和节约劳力。除了安排一定的劳力养猪外，还十分重视改革饲养工具，提高饲养工效，节约饲养人员。桃园和马店大队，都试用管道送水代替人工挑水，用空中滑道和地上轨道送食代替人工挑抬送食，在煮料锅上加木桶以便多煮饲料。马店大队工具改革搞得好的两个生产组共饲养三百多头猪，原来用三十八个饲养员，现在只需要十五个饲养员，节约劳力60％。
    开展防疫工作。公社成立了制药厂、兽医院，大队成立防疫站，配备防疫员五十五人，经常检查家畜家禽的防疫情况，进行防疫注射。在饲养管理中，又注意饲料和猪房的清洁卫生，每隔三天喷洒一次石灰水消毒，建立病猪隔离室，发现病猪立即隔离，大大降低了生猪死亡率。去年以来，基本上达到了无疫无瘟社的目标。
    本报贵溪14日电　江西省贵溪县商业部门与农业部门密切协作，从购、销、调三方面大力支持人民公社发展家畜家禽和鱼类生产，为公社打开增加收入的门路，为国家开辟更多的肉食货源。
    目前，全县家畜家禽和鱼类生产不仅计划落实，普遍到了社、队、户；而且发展十分迅速。据5月底的统计，全县生猪已发展到十一万多头，占全年发展计划61％以上；耕牛已达二万五千余头，占全年发展计划80％以上；鸡鸭鹅等家禽已达三十万只，占全年发展计划50％左右；鱼类除去留塘二百八十万尾外，并新放养了三百八十万尾小鱼苗。随着家畜家禽等迅速发展，全县生猪、鲜蛋、鱼类等收购工作也进展迅速，为城市工矿提供了大量的肉食货源。全县到5月17日止，即外调生猪一千余头，提前四十八天超额完成了第二季度的生猪上调任务；还及时上调鲜蛋一千二百余斤，捕捞鲜鱼十八万多担。
    今年以来，全县各人民公社根据“公养私养并重”的方针，大力发展家畜家禽和鱼类等肉食生产。要求达到两个劳动力一头牛；每户两头猪；每人二到三只鸡；所有水面都养上鱼类。但在发展过程中，碰到了一些困难，主要是猪仔、种蛋、鱼苗缺乏和余缺不匀；饲料不足；部分社员私养缺乏资金等等。商业部门在党委的统一领导下，主动加强了与农业部门的协作，大力支持人民公社社员克服困难。县商业局与农业局联合组成了全县畜牧业生产办公室，互通情报，统一行动，指导畜牧业生产；各级商业部门根据当地实际情况和问题，加强了具体组织工作。
    首先，加强了预购活动，全县商业部门专门抽调了一百余名商业职工，深入人民公社，与各公社、生产大队签订了预购合同，并发放了家畜家禽和鱼类生产的无息定金八万余元。通过签订合同，发放定金，既帮助人民公社社员解决了资金困难，刺激了社员发展家畜家禽等生产的积极性，同时又使全县家畜家禽和鱼类生产计划全部落了实。如：泗沥公社金刚大队在商业部门的支持下，平均每户养猪达二头、养鸡五到十只，家畜家禽饲养项目达十九项之多。
    在开展预购活动的同时，商业部门主动地组织了猪仔、种蛋、鱼苗的余缺调剂工作。全县在贵溪、鹰潭两地专门设立了猪仔等调剂市场，由商业部门统一收购，统一出售；在价格上坚持原价进、原价出，各地人民公社的国营商店则就地收购，就地出售，负责公社内部的调剂工作。结果，全县调剂了猪仔一万余头，克服了猪仔不足的困难。其他如种蛋、鱼苗等等，也都通过商业部门的统一收购和统一出售，调剂了余缺。
    全县商业部门从内外两方面开辟饲料来源。他们与本县各蔬菜社、各公社挂钩，统一收购质量较差的蔬菜和野生植物，又统一销售给各地公社饲养场和社员；从外省外县购进一批饲料，在县内供应。例如，商业部门从广东收购了可作猪食的水浮莲苗八千多斤，供应给各公社饲养场和社员放入水塘繁殖，量多质佳，成了全县生猪的主要饲料之一。
    商业部门正在总结前一阶段的工作，准备加强对饲养工作的技术指导，以防止幼畜幼禽发生病害，保证成活率达到预期的目标，进一步发展家畜家禽和鱼类生产。（附图片）
