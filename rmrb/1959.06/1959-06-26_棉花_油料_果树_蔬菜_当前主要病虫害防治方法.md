The production techniques of crops such as cotton, oil crops, fruit trees, and vegetables share common characteristics: they are scattered across different producing areas, cultivated intensively in concentrated areas, and require meticulous cultivation and management techniques. They also generate high yields per unit area, and are susceptible to a wide variety of diseases and pests. The quality of the products is closely related to the effectiveness of pest and disease control.

Currently, the major diseases and pests affecting these crops have a wide host range. In particular, several boring pests directly damage buds, bolls, and fruits, causing significant destruction.

Cotton

Major cotton-producing areas are currently in the budding and flowering stages. In northern cotton regions, the focus should be on using pesticides to control cotton bollworms, while also addressing pink bollworms, loopers, and cutworms. In southern cotton regions, the focus should be on pink bollworms and cutworms, while also controlling leafhoppers and other pests. Strengthening cotton field management through cultivation and pruning can prevent bud and boll diseases, such as angular leaf spot and boll rot.

To achieve effective control, the following points should be noted: ① Conduct mass surveys of pest and disease information. Organize pest and disease information inspectors at the production team level, relying on the guidance of monitoring and forecasting stations, to conduct periodic sampling and inspection, identify the types of cotton pests and diseases during the budding and boll stage, and check the effectiveness of control measures. For example, in northern cotton regions, mid-June, July, and August will be the emergence periods for the second, third, and fourth generations of cotton bollworm moths. It is crucial to begin spraying DDT or 666 preparations at the early stage of egg hatching, when the rate of egg-bearing plants suddenly increases (when the egg-bearing plant rate or the number of eggs per hundred plants on that day is approximately three times that of the previous three days). ② The amount of raw drug or liquid used per mu should be increased or decreased according to the size of the cotton plants. In mid-to-late June, approximately one-third of a jin of 25% DDT emulsion can be used per mu. In mid-to-late July, this can be increased to half a jin, and in mid-to-late August, one jin of raw drug should be sprayed per mu. The dilution ratio should be determined based on the amount of diluted liquid sprayed per mu at that time, generally around 200 times. ③ Spraying must be thorough. The tops of the main stems and branches of cotton plants, as well as the boll-bearing areas, have a higher concentration of insect eggs, requiring comprehensive spraying to prevent pests from escaping. ④ The pesticide should be thoroughly stirred during preparation to maintain a uniform solution and ensure its effectiveness. ⑤ Production teams are required to quickly complete the control tasks during favorable control periods, and should first prepare for the inspection, repair, and modification of control tools to improve control efficiency. Cotton boll rot often occurs in dense cotton fields. Attention should be paid to agricultural technical management, such as ditching for drainage, earthing up, and deep cultivation, to maintain ventilation and light transmission in the cotton fields. In northern cotton regions, effective agricultural technical measures should be taken in early to mid-July based on forecasts to prevent the occurrence of diseases and pests. When necessary, Bordeaux mixture can be sprayed to control them.

Oil Crops

In the soybean producing areas of Northeast and North China, the main pest of soybeans, the soybean pod borer moth, will soon emerge as adults in late July and early August. Larvae bore into young pods, causing insect-damaged beans. During the peak emergence period of adults, spray a mixed powder of DDT and 666, or spray a 5,000-fold solution of 1605 during the peak period of egg hatching. Soybean pod borer moths pupate on the soil surface in late July, with the peak period in early August. At this time, in some areas of Northeast China where wheat fields were previously planted with soybeans, timely plowing after wheat harvest to eliminate pupae can reduce the number of adults emerging from the soil. In provinces such as Shandong, Henan, and Anhui, soybean hawkmoth adults will soon emerge in late June, with the peak period of occurrence in July. Capture and kill them as soon as possible. When early-stage larvae are discovered, 0.5% 666 powder can be sprayed for control.

Last year, loopers occurred widely in soybean fields in the Yellow River and Huai River basins, causing severe damage. Effective control can be achieved by using 0.5% 666 powder or 6% wettable 666 diluted to 250-300 times the liquid. Soybean pod borers often occur in southern soybean producing areas. Using 666 preparations to control adults has a certain effect. In the peanut producing areas of North China, grubs damage the roots and young fruits. If control was not carried out at the time of sowing, toxic soil or toxic grain can be applied to eliminate the pests when damage is discovered during the flowering period. For the control of peanut leaf spot disease, focus on spraying effective pesticides such as Bordeaux mixture or zineb. Other oil crop diseases and pests, such as hawkmoths and spider mites that damage sesame, and peach fruit borers that damage sunflowers, should be eliminated promptly after discovery to prevent their spread.

Fruit Trees

Currently, the diseases and pests affecting fruit trees such as apples and pears are mainly various fruit-boring insects and fruit diseases. Pruning infested young shoots on peach trees is an effective way to eliminate small fruit borers and prevent damage to pear fruits. Picking insect-infested fruits and fallen fruits can suppress the recurrence of peach small fruit borers and Northeast small fruit borers. Timely spraying of 25% DDT emulsion or 50% wettable DDT powder diluted to 150 times the liquid can eliminate early-stage larvae of the three types of fruit borers, as well as control adults and other leaf-eating pests. Spraying a 200-fold solution of lead arsenate has a similar effect to DDT. Lead arsenate and DDT can both be mixed with Bordeaux mixture (prepared with equal amounts of lime) at 200-300 times the solution; however, they should be prepared and used immediately, and should not be left to stand. These pesticides can also control apple leaf spot, anthracnose, pear black spot, and other diseases. In recent years, spider mites have become a major pest of apples and pears. Spraying 0.3% to 0.5% lime sulfur mixture, with a second spray after an interval of eight days, can completely eliminate them. Using 46.6% 1605 or 50% 1059 diluted to 3,000-4,000 times the liquid can also kill aphids and spider mites, with the former also killing fruit borer eggs. However, organophosphorus pesticides are not safe for humans and animals, and their use must be stopped one month before fruit harvest. In southern citrus producing areas, control of citrus fruit flies should be carried out currently. Adult flies can be lured and killed with sugar-vinegar poison, and maggots in infested fruits should be removed or collected.

The methods for controlling mites such as red and yellow spider mites and rust mites that damage citrus are the same as those for controlling similar pests on apples. For controlling citrus scale insects, rosin mixture or organophosphorus pesticides can be used. In areas where experience has been gained in using natural enemies to eliminate scale insects (biological control), it should be vigorously promoted. While applying pesticides in orchards, special attention should be paid to protecting natural enemies. During the summer and autumn shoot periods of citrus, continue spraying Bordeaux mixture at a lime concentration of 0.5% to 0.8% to prevent citrus canker. Using a 2:15:100 garlic slurry water solution to prevent canker also has a certain effect.

For the control of grape black rot in northern grape producing areas, timely application of Bordeaux mixture at a lime concentration of 200-300 times, sprayed every half month, can completely control the damage. In late June and early July, attention should be paid to controlling walnut fruit moths, persimmon anthracnose, round spot disease, and angular leaf spot. For persimmon fruit worms, jujube spanworms, and inchworms, seize the opportunity to use 25% DDT emulsion diluted to 300-400 times the liquid for control.

Vegetables

Cucumber downy mildew in North China generally begins to occur in mid-May, with severe outbreaks in June and July. The severity of the damage is closely related to the amount of rainfall and the duration of rainfall in May and June. For example, in Beijing this year, the climate was dry in May, and the outbreak was relatively mild. Cucumber powdery mildew generally starts in late May, with severe outbreaks from June to September. Currently, inspections in Beijing show a general trend of outbreaks. If control of the above two diseases is delayed slightly, it will greatly affect cucumber growth. In the early stages of the disease, removing diseased leaves is important for suppressing the spread of the disease. The use of Bordeaux mixture, copper soap liquid, or zineb diluted to 500-800 times is effective for controlling cucumber downy mildew. According to indoor test results, the local pesticide "Shengdi" is also quite effective. A 0.2% lime sulfur mixture can control cucumber powdery mildew and also control spider mites. However, it is prone to causing pesticide damage when used in the early stages of cucumber growth, and a 1,000-fold solution of copper sulfate can be used instead. Cotton aphids and spider mites that damage cucumbers can be controlled by spraying 20% wettable 666 diluted to 1,000 times the liquid, or rotenone diluted to 800 times the liquid. When diseases and pests occur simultaneously, the above fungicides and insecticides can be mixed and used.

Tomato leaf mold and early blight mostly occur in the middle and late stages of growth. Eggplant blight and brown spot disease generally occur in July, August, and September. If there is continuous rain during these three months, they will rapidly occur, causing severe rotting and shedding of eggplants. Bordeaux mixture (1:1:240) can be used. If 0.1% mercury preparation No. 1 is added, the control effect can be improved. When the initial signs of the disease are discovered, removing diseased leaves and fruits can prevent the disease from continuing to spread. In addition, red spider mites are often found on eggplants, and cotton bollworms damage tomatoes, which can be controlled using the methods for controlling cotton pests.

    棉花·油料·果树·蔬菜
    当前主要病虫害防治方法
    棉花、油料、果树、蔬菜等作物的生产技术，有共同特点：分散在不同产区，集中种植，耕作管理技术精细；单位面积收益大；发生的病虫种类多。产品的质量和病虫防治工作的好坏大有关系。
    当前这些作物已发生或可能发生的主要病虫害，寄主范围较广，特别是几种蛀食性害虫，直接为害蕾铃、果实，毁灭性很大。
    棉花
    当前主要棉区，正值棉花现蕾开花阶段。北部棉区应以药剂防治棉铃虫为主，兼治红铃虫、造桥虫、金钢钻；南部棉区以红铃虫、金钢钻为主，兼治叶跳虫等。加强棉田的中耕整枝管理，能预防蕾铃期病害，如角斑病和蕾铃病害等。
    为了作到巧治，应该注意以下几点：①开展群众性的病虫情报普查。以生产队为单位，组织病虫情报检查员，依靠测报站的指导，逐期取样检查，摸清蕾铃期棉花病虫的种类和发生期，防治后还要检查效果。例如北部棉区，6、7、8月中旬将是第二、第三、第四代棉铃虫成虫的出现期，必须在虫卵孵化初期，当棉田有卵株率突然上升时（当天的有卵株率或百株的卵粒数约为前三天的三倍时），即开始喷洒滴滴涕或666制剂。②每亩使用的原药或液量，需根据棉株的大小而增减，6月中下旬时，每亩可用25％滴滴涕乳剂约三分之一斤，7月中下旬可增到半斤，8月中下旬每亩喷洒原药一斤。兑水倍数，应按当时每亩喷洒的稀释液量来决定，一般约兑水二百倍左右。③喷洒必须周密，棉株主茎和分枝的顶部，着生蕾铃的部位，虫卵的分布量较集中，需要全面洒药，否则害虫容易漏网。④配药时应充分搅拌，保持药液均匀，发挥应有药效。⑤要求各生产队在治虫的有利时机内，迅速完成防治任务，先要作好治虫工具的检修改装等工作，提高治虫效率。棉花的烂铃病，多发生在棉株茂密的棉田内，应当注意农业技术管理。如开沟排水、培土、深中耕等办法，使棉田保持通风透光。北部棉区在7月上中旬，要根据预报，及时进行有效地农业技术措施，防止病虫发生，必要时可重点喷洒波多尔药液除治。
    油料作物
    在东北和华北大豆产区内，7月末、8月上旬为害大豆的主要害虫——大豆食心虫成虫即将羽化。幼虫钻蛀嫩荚，造成虫食豆。当成虫盛发期，喷撒滴滴涕、666混合粉剂，或在卵孵化盛期喷洒五千倍1605液。7月下旬大豆食心虫在土表化蛹，8月上旬为盛期，此时东北部分地区，前茬为豆作的麦地，在小麦收获后，及时翻耕灭蛹，可减少成虫羽化出土的数量。在山东、河南、安徽等省，6月下旬豆天蛾成虫即将羽化，7月间是发生盛期，应当抓紧捕杀。发现初龄幼虫时，可喷撒0.5％666粉剂除治。
    去年在黄河、淮河流域，豆田内曾普遍发生造桥虫，为害严重。用0.5％666粉或6％可湿性666，稀释二百五十至三百倍液，防治有效。南方大豆产区常发生豆荚螟，用666制剂防治成虫，有一定效果。华北花生产区内，蛴螬为害根部及幼果，如播种时未进行防治，到开花期发现为害时，可施用毒土、毒谷消灭虫害。防治花生叶斑病，重点喷洒波尔多液或代森锌等有效药剂。其他油料作物病虫，如为害芝麻的天蛾、红蜘蛛；危害向日葵的桃蛀螟等发现后，要及早消灭，制止蔓延。
    果树
    当前为害苹果、梨等果树的病虫，以各种食心虫类和果实病害为主。剪除桃树上被害的嫩梢，是消灭小食心虫、阻止向梨果为害的有效办法。摘虫果、摘落果可压低桃小食心虫和东北小食心虫的再度为害，及时喷洒25％滴滴涕乳剂，或50％可湿性滴滴涕粉剂一百五十倍液，可以消灭三种食心虫的初龄幼虫，兼治成虫和其他食叶的害虫。喷洒二百倍砒酸铅液，其药效近似滴滴涕。砒酸铅和滴滴涕都可以和石灰等量式二百至三百倍的波尔多剂混合喷洒；但要随用随配，切忌搁置。这几种药还可兼治苹果叶斑病、炭疽病、梨黑星病等。近年，红蜘蛛已成为苹果、梨的主要害虫，喷洒0.3％到0.5％度石灰硫磺合剂，间隔八天，应连续喷第二次，能彻底消灭。用46.6％1605或50％1059稀释成三千至四千倍液，可兼杀蚜虫和红蜘蛛，前者又能兼杀食心虫的卵。但有机磷制剂对人畜不安全，在果实采收前一个月必须停止使用。南方柑桔产区，当前应防治柑桔大实蝇，可用糖醋毒液诱杀成虫，摘除或拣拾蛆果等办法。
    对为害柑桔的红、黄蜘蛛，锈壁虱等螨类，与苹果上防治此类害虫的方法相同；防治柑桔介壳虫，可用松脂合剂或有机磷制剂。在利用天敌消灭介壳虫已取得经验的地区（以虫治虫），应大力推广，在果园施用药剂的同时，应特别注意保护天敌。在柑桔夏梢和秋梢期，继续喷洒倍量石灰0.5％到0.8％的波尔多液，防治柑桔溃疡病，用2∶15∶100的大蒜泥浆水防治溃疡病，也有一定效果。
    防治北部葡萄产区的黑痘病，及时施用石灰少量式二百至三百倍波尔多液，每半月喷洒一次，即可完全控制为害。6月底7月初应注意防治核桃举肢蛾、柿炭疽病、圆斑病、角斑病等。对柿蒂虫、枣粘虫和木橑尺蠖，应抓紧时机用25％滴滴涕乳剂三百至四百倍稀释液防治。
    蔬菜
    黄瓜霜霉病在华北地区，一般5月中旬开始发生，6到7月发病严重，为害程度与5到6月份内降水时间和降水量的多少有密切关系。如在北京今年5月间气候干燥，发病较轻。黄瓜白粉病，多从5月下旬开始，6到9月发病严重。目前在北京检查，已有普遍发病的趋势。以上两种病害，如防治稍晚，对黄瓜生长影响很大。发病初期，摘除病叶，对抑制病害的蔓延有重要作用。用波尔多或铜皂液或五百至八百倍的代森锌防治黄瓜霜霉病有效。据室内测定结果，土农药“升底”亦相当有效。用0.2度石灰硫磺合剂能防治黄瓜白粉病，并兼治红蜘蛛。但使用在黄瓜生长前期，易发生药害，可改用一千倍的硫酸铜液。为害黄瓜的棉蚜和红蜘蛛，可喷洒20％可湿性666一千倍液，或鱼藤精八百倍液。病虫同时发生时，可将上述杀菌杀虫剂混合使用。
    番茄叶霉病和斑枯病多发生在生长中后期；茄子绵疫病和褐纹病一般在7、8、9三个月内，如连续阴雨，会迅速发生，使茄果严重腐烂脱落。可使用波尔多（1∶1∶240）液，如加入0.1％水银制剂一号，则可提高防治效果。当发现病征初期，摘除病叶、病果，能制止病害继续蔓延。此外茄子上常发现红蜘蛛，番茄上有棉铃虫为害，可按棉花虫害防治方法除治。
