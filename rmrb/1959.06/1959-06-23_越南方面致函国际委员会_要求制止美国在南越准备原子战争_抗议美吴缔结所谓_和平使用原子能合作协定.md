Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, June 22nd: Hanoi newspapers reported today that Senior Colonel Ha Van Lau, head of the Liaison Delegation of the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army, wrote to the International Commission on the 15th to protest the so-called "Cooperation Agreement on Peaceful Use of Atomic Energy" concluded between the United States and the South Vietnamese authorities.

The letter stated that, according to foreign news agency reports, the United States and the South Vietnamese authorities signed the so-called "Cooperation Agreement on Peaceful Use of Atomic Energy" on April 22nd. According to this agreement, the United States will supply South Vietnam with six kilograms of uranium.

The letter pointed out that the so-called "Cooperation Agreement on Peaceful Use of Atomic Energy" concluded between the United States and the South Vietnamese authorities is part of the US conspiracy to prepare for a new war in South Vietnam. This agreement will serve the US conspiracy to arm the South Vietnamese army with atomic weapons, thereby deepening the crisis threatening peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia.

Ha Van Lau requested the International Commission to pay special attention to the aforementioned serious violation of the Geneva Accords and to take measures to stop this behavior.

The letter pointed out that the United States has long been attempting to equip the South Vietnamese army with atomic weapons. In November 1958, Charles Shav, Assistant to the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Military Assistance Programs of the United States, said: "It is necessary to equip the South Vietnamese army with atomic weapons." On February 23rd of this year, Walter Robertson, Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs, also spoke about the issue of using nuclear weapons in the Far East region, including South Vietnam, at the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

The letter stated that the US authorities and the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities have carried out a series of preparations for several years in order to realize the above-mentioned conspiracy. In 1955, more than 100 South Vietnamese officers and military school students were sent to US Air Force schools to study. In 1956, 125 South Vietnamese officers were sent to the US Army Infantry School at Fort Benning to study. In 1957, South Vietnamese Navy Colonel Le Quang My led another group of officers to the US Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, to study the methods of using atomic weapons at sea. In 1957 and 1958, about 70 South Vietnamese officers also went to the US Army Field Artillery School at Fort Sill to study the use of atomic weapons such as "Honest John" and "Nike" missiles. Last year, the South Vietnamese authorities also sent officers to Thailand twice to attend Southeast Asia Treaty Organization air force exercises involving atomic weapons.

    越南方面致函国际委员会 
    要求制止美国在南越准备原子战争
    抗议美吴缔结所谓“和平使用原子能合作协定”
    新华社河内22日电　据河内报纸今天报道，越南人民军总司令部联络代表团团长何文楼大校在15日写信给国际委员会抗议美国和南越当局缔结所谓“和平使用原子能合作协定”。
    信中说，据外国通讯社消息报道，美国和南越当局在4月22日签订了所谓“和平使用原子能合作协定”。根据这项协定，美国将供给南越六公斤铀。
    信中指出，美国和南越当局缔结的所谓“和平使用原子能合作协定”，是美国在南越准备发动新战争阴谋的一部分。这项协定将为美国用原子武器武装南越军队的阴谋服务，从而加深了威胁印度支那和东南亚和平的危机。
    何文楼要求国际委员会特别注意上述严重违反日内瓦协议的行为，并且采取措施制止这种行为。
    信中指出，美国很久以来，一直企图以原子武器装备南越军队。1958年11月，美国负责军事援助计划的助理国防部长帮办查尔斯·夏夫说：“南越军队有必要装备原子武器。”今年2月23日，美国远东事务助理国务卿罗伯逊在参议院外交委员会上也谈到关于包括南越在内的远东地区使用核武器问题。
    信中说，几年来美国当局和吴庭艳当局为了实现上述阴谋而进行了一系列的准备工作。1955年有一百多名南越军官和军事学校学生派到美国空军学校去学习。1956年有一百二十五名南越军官派到美国本宁堡陆军学校去学习。1957年，南越海军大校黎光美率领另一批军官到美国马里兰州的安纳波利斯海军学校，学习在海上使用原子武器的方法。1957、1958年还约有七十名南越军官到美国西尔堡炮兵学校去学习使用“诚实的约翰”式和“奈克”式导弹等原子武器。去年，南越当局还曾经两次派军官到泰国去出席东南亚军事集团带有原子武器的空军演习。
