　　Spring in Dawan

　　Recently, 132 family members of boatmen from the Dawan Wooden Sailboat Transportation Cooperative in Guangdong have moved from their boats to live on land.

　　To facilitate the relocation of boatmen's families to land, the Dawan Wooden Sailboat Transportation Cooperative allocated 20,000 yuan to build 33 houses, and the Dawan Party and government leading organs also allocated more than 180 mu of dry land. The boatmen's families planted 5,000 fruit trees around their houses and raised 70 pigs and over 500 chickens. They also plan to grow peanuts, soybeans, and vegetables, and plan to increase the cooperative's income by 40,000 yuan this year.

　　Today, the safety of the lives of the old, weak, women, and children among the boatmen's families has been reliably guaranteed. The children no longer have to wear wooden gourds tied to their bodies all day long. Seventy-four school-age children are happily going to Dawan Elementary School to study.　　　　　(Lǐ Míng)

    大湾的春天
    最近，广东大湾木帆船运输社一百三十二名船民家属离船迁居陆上了。
    为了让船民家属移居陆地，大湾木帆船运输社拨款二万元，修建了三十三间房子，大湾党政领导机关也拨给了一百八十多亩旱地。船民家属们在住房四周种上了五千棵果树，养了七十头猪，五百多只鸡。他们还准备种花生、黄豆和蔬菜，计划今年为运输社增加四万元的收入。
    今天，船民家属中的老、弱、妇、孺的生命安全已经有了可靠的保障。孩子们再也没有成天身上系着木葫芦的了。七十四名学龄儿童都欢天喜地到大湾小学去念书了。　　　　　（里明）
