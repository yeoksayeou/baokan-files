    Abundant Harvests Should Not Make Us Forget Thrift and Frugality
    As we celebrate the first great victory on the agricultural front in 1959, we must not only carefully summarize the experience of small-scale spring production, muster greater efforts, and strive for even greater harvests in large-scale spring production to achieve this year's agricultural production increase targets; but also cherish the fruits of our labor that we have already obtained, be more diligent and thrifty, make careful calculations, and properly arrange our production and lives, because this is an important aspect of consolidating the people's communes and promoting high-speed production development.
    However, after the communization and the great agricultural harvests of last year, some communes in some places did not pay enough attention to implementing the policy of running communes with diligence and thrift. It should be understood that diligence and thrift are the fundamental policies of our socialist construction. Diligence and thrift are an inseparable unity. Diligence means diligent production, working hard, practically, and skillfully, fully and rationally utilizing manpower, materials, and financial resources, continuously improving labor productivity, increasing production, and increasing the income of the state, the collective, and the individual. Thrift means making careful calculations, rational expenditures, and using every penny and every bit of labor in the most urgently needed production and construction, doing as much as possible with as little money and labor as possible. Only diligence without thrift, wasting the fruits of hard labor at will, will not increase accumulation, will cause difficulties in production and life, and will not be conducive to the consolidation of the commune and the rapid, good, and economical development of production. Only thrift without diligence will not increase production or accumulation, and will not be conducive to the consolidation of the commune and the rapid, good, and economical development of production.
    We should also understand that increasing production, practicing strict economy, and gradually improving people's lives on the basis of developing production is an unwavering policy of our Party. However, improvements in life should be planned. If we depart from the foundation of developing production and eat and drink extravagantly and without limit, without considering increasing accumulation and expanding reproduction, this is not only not good for the country and the collective, but also not good for oneself. Only caring about temporary, immediate enjoyment, lacking grand ambitions, and not striving to increase production and practice strict economy is not conducive to the development of production and the acceleration of socialist construction, nor is it conducive to the gradual and better improvement of people's lives.
    We must firmly remember what Chairman Mao said in his article "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People": "We want to carry out large-scale construction, but our country is still a very poor country, which is a contradiction. Comprehensively and persistently practicing economy is a way to resolve this contradiction." "We must make all cadres and all the people constantly think that our country is a large socialist country, but it is also an economically backward and poor country, which is a big contradiction. To make our country rich and strong, it will take decades of hard struggle, and we must strictly implement the policy of building the country through diligence and thrift, and opposing waste."
    To this end, we must strengthen the education of all Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, and the vast number of cadres, requiring them to lead by example and lead the masses to establish a universal and solid atmosphere of diligence and thrift, strive to increase production, practice strict economy, and create a public moral resistance and hatred of extravagance and waste. Within the people's communes, we must establish and improve a set of management systems that are adapted to the new situation of rural production, distribution, exchange, and consumption, and implement strict mass supervision over all financial expenditures. At the same time, we must also pay attention to summarizing experience, learning how to manage the household and finances, and being good at arranging production and life.
    Abundant harvests should not make us forget thrift and frugality. As long as we further implement the policy of running communes with diligence and thrift, our production this year will surely see a greater leap forward, and the economy of the people's communes will develop better and more comprehensively; the lives of all commune members will surely be greatly improved with the development of production.

### 丰收不忘勤俭

    丰收不忘勤俭
    当我们在庆祝1959年农业战线上第一个大胜利的时候，不仅要认真总结小春生产的经验，鼓足更大的干劲，争取大春生产的更大丰收，实现今年农业增产的计划指标；而且还要珍惜我们已经获得的劳动果实，更勤更俭，精打细算，妥善地安排我们的生产和生活，因为这是巩固人民公社，促进生产高速度发展的一个重要方面。
    但是，在去年的公社化和农业生产大丰收以后，有的地方有些公社曾经一度对贯彻执行勤俭办社的方针注意不够。应该懂得：勤俭是我国社会主义建设的根本方针。勤和俭是不可分割的统一体。勤，是勤劳生产，苦干实干巧干，充分地合理地利用人力、物力和财力，不断提高劳动生产率，增加生产，增加国家的、集体的和个人的收入。俭，是精打细算，合理开支，把每一文钱、每一分劳动力都用到最迫切需要的生产建设上去，用尽可能少的钱和尽可能少的劳动力办尽可能多的事。只勤不俭，把辛勤劳动的果实，任意挥霍，就不能增加积累，就会造成生产和生活上的困难，就不利于公社的巩固和多快好省地发展生产。只俭不勤，更不能增加生产、增加积累，也更不利于公社的巩固和多快好省地发展生产。
    我们还应该懂得：增加生产、厉行节约和在发展生产的基础上逐步改善人民的生活，这是我们党的一项坚定不移的方针。但是，生活的改善应该是有计划的。如果离开了发展生产这个基础，把生产出来的东西，无计划地、无限度地大吃大喝，不考虑增加积累，扩大再生产，这不仅对国家和集体没有好处，就是对自己也没有好处，只顾暂时的、眼前的享受，缺乏宏图大志，不努力增加生产和厉行节约，是不利于生产的发展和加速社会主义建设，也不利于人民生活逐步地更好地改善。
    我们要牢牢记住毛主席在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”一文中所说的：“我们要进行大规模的建设，但是我国还是一个很穷的国家，就是一个矛盾。全面地持久地厉行节约，就是解决这个矛盾的一个方法。”“要使全体干部和全体人民经常想到我国是一个社会主义的大国，但又是一个经济落后的穷国，这是一个很大的矛盾。要使我国富强起来，需要几十年艰苦奋斗的时间，必须严格执行厉行节约、反对浪费这样一个勤俭建国的方针。”
    为此，我们必须加强对所有的共产党员、共青团员和广大干部的教育，要求他们以身作则，带领群众把勤劳俭朴的风气普遍地巩固地树立起来，努力增产，厉行节约，并对铺张浪费行为造成公众的普遍的道德抵制和憎恨的气氛。在人民公社内部，要建立与健全一套适应目前农村生产、分配、交换、消费新的情况所需要的管理制度，对各项财务开支，实行严格的群众性的监督。同时，还要注意总结经验，学会当家理财，善于安排生产和生活。
    丰收不忘勤俭。只要我们进一步贯彻执行勤俭办社的方针，一定会使我们今年的生产出现更大的跃进，使人民公社的经济更好更全面地发展起来；一定会使全体社员的生活随着生产的发展获得更大的改善。
