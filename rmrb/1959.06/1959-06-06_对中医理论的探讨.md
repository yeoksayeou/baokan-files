    The recently published "Newsletter on Dialectics of Nature Research," 1959, second issue, features an article by Cui Hong, "How to Study and Organize the Legacy of Traditional Chinese Medicine." The author offers some analysis and research on the theories of traditional Chinese medicine and puts forward some of his own opinions. These opinions are open for discussion.
    The author first affirms the correctness and scientific nature of traditional Chinese medicine theory, especially the rich philosophical thought contained in the Yin-Yang and Five Elements theory. He states that the Yin-Yang and Five Elements theory is essentially a form of naive materialism and dialectical thought.
    However, the author believes that because the theory of traditional Chinese medicine is a kind of naive materialism and dialectical thought, it carries with it characteristics of intuitiveness, limitations, and spontaneity. Therefore, we must undertake further work of organization and improvement to move it beyond its naive state and allow traditional Chinese medicine to achieve greater development.
    The author cites several shortcomings of traditional Chinese medicine theory. He says that when the Five Elements theory is applied to physiology, it explains the interrelation and interaction between the functions of different parts of the organism, but to categorize all relationships between things into five categories seems to simplify the complexity of objective reality. Furthermore, how exactly the five organs are specifically connected and how they complete the functions of "generation, overcoming, restriction, and transformation" requires further exploration. This shows that traditional Chinese medicine theory is insufficient in summarizing the specific and particular laws of organic activity. More importantly, the neurocentric principle, one of the basic principles of modern physiology, is not well reflected in traditional Chinese medicine. The Five Elements theory cannot encompass the laws of nerve activity. According to the Five Elements theory, the unity of the organism and the state of balance within the organism are the result of the interaction between the five elements; while according to the neurocentric principle, the nervous system plays a leading role both in the integrity and unity of the organism itself and in the unity of the organism with its environment. So, where in the five elements should the relationship between the nervous system and the various parts of the organism be placed? The Five Elements theory reveals its weakness in explaining the universal and complex connections between organisms. The theory of "correspondence between man and nature" reflects the principle of the unity of the organism and the environment, but its understanding of things inevitably involves far-fetched interpretations, such as the obviously inappropriate explanation that "heaven has the sun and moon, and man has ears and eyes." In addition, this intuitive and limited theory has also restricted the development of traditional Chinese medicine, as can be seen in the current breaking of many forbidden acupoints in acupuncture treatment.
    Studying, organizing, and improving traditional Chinese medicine is a rather arduous task. The author proposes that this requires the joint efforts and broad cooperation of medical and health workers and philosophical theorists, as well as the guidance of dialectical materialism. The author emphasizes that this does not mean advocating simply replacing Yin-Yang and Five Elements with certain theories. Further improving the theoretical foundation of traditional Chinese medicine is a long-term process of mutual influence and interaction between the two sides. The author believes that the first step is to consciously, purposefully, and clearly organize, summarize, and generalize the many existing facts; the second step is to use modern theoretical knowledge for experimental research, analysis, and application, which can then be summarized and improved into new theories. Even with new theories, one cannot immediately abandon the original ones but must continue to explore them. Only through continuous exploration, research, organization, and improvement can we avoid losing the legacy of our ancestors.

### 对中医理论的探讨

    对中医理论的探讨
    新近出版的“自然辩证法研究通讯”1959年第二期，发表了崔宏的“如何研究整理祖国医学遗产”一文。作者对祖国医学理论作了一些分析和研究，并且提出了自己的一些意见。这些意见是可供讨论的。
    作者首先肯定了祖国医学理论的正确性和科学性，特别是阴阳五行学说具有丰富的哲学思想。他说，阴阳五行学说在本质上是一种朴素的唯物主义和辩证法的思想。
    但是作者认为，由于祖国医学理论是一种朴素的唯物主义和辩证法的思想，所以它就带有直观性、局限性和自发性。因此，我们必须作进一步的整理和提高的工作，以便使它脱离朴素的状态，使祖国医学得到更大的发展。
    作者例举了祖国医学理论的若干缺点。他说，五行学说应用到生理学上说明了有机体各部分机能间的相互联系和相互作用，然而要是把一切事物间的联系都归纳为五类，那就似乎简化了客观现实的复杂性。再则，五脏间到底如何具体地联系，如何完成生克“制化的作用”，是需要作进一步探讨的。这说明祖国医学理论在对总结有机体活动的具体的特殊的规律方面还不够。更重要的是现代生理学的基本原则之一的神经论原则，在祖国医学中体现得不多。五行学说概括不了神经活动的规律。按照五行学说，有机体的统一性和有机体内部的平衡状态是五行间相互作用的结果；而按照神经论的原则，神经系统不论是在有机体自身的完整统一上，还是在有机体同环境的统一上都是起主导作用的。那末，神经系统同有机体各部分间的这种关系，应该放在五行中的哪一行呢？五行学说在说明有机体间的普遍而又复杂的联系方面显出了它的弱点。“天人相应”的学说反映了有机体同环境统一的原则，但是它对事物的理解难免有牵强之处，如“天有日月，人有耳目”之类的解释显然是不恰当的。此外，这种直观性的局限性的理论，也限制了祖国医学的发展，如目前在针灸治疗中打破很多禁穴就可以说明这一点。
    研究、整理和提高祖国医学是一个相当艰巨的工作，作者提出，这需要医药卫生工作者和哲学理论工作者的共同努力和广泛合作，以及需要辩证唯物主义的思想指导。并且作者着重提出，这并不等于主张简单地以某些理论来代替阴阳五行。进一步提高祖国医学的理论基础，这是一个长期的、双方相互影响相互作用的过程。作者认为，首先要有意识地目标明确地整理、总结和概括已有的许多事实，其次要用近代的理论知识加以实验研究分析和应用，这就可以再加以总结，提高为新的理论。这时虽然有了新的理论，但是还不能一下放弃原来的东西，而还必须继续发掘。只有这样不断发掘、研究、整理和提高，才不致使祖先遗产受到损失。
