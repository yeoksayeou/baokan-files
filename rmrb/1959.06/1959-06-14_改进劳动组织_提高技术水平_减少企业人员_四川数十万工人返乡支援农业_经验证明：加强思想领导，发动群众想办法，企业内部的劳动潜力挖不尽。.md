    Chengdu, June 13th (by our reporter) - The industrial front in Sichuan Province is vigorously transferring personnel to support agricultural production. Through continuous improvement of labor organization and enhancement of labor productivity, 500,000 people have been transferred back to rural areas and other production posts from January to May this year. More than 200,000 people will continue to be transferred in June.

    After Sichuan Province launched a mass campaign for all the people to run industry in 1958, industrial production and construction throughout the province achieved unprecedented development, and the number of employees increased rapidly. The total number of employees in industrial, transportation, and capital construction departments above the county level in the province increased by 1.46 times in 1958 compared to 1957. This year, thanks to the improvement of enterprise management and employee technical skills, various localities have focused on consolidating labor organization, technically transforming newly built enterprises, and mobilizing the masses to launch technical revolutions and technical innovations, comprehensively improving labor productivity from the very beginning. On the steel front, after large-scale transformation of indigenous furnace clusters, promoting mechanization and semi-mechanization to replace manual operation, and implementing parallel operation of machines and furnaces, more than 370,000 people had been transferred out by May. The capital construction departments have vigorously improved labor organization, innovated tools, and implemented vehicle-based transportation, also saving 100,000 people to invest in other production departments.

    By grasping both the consolidation and improvement of labor organization and the enhancement of labor productivity, many enterprises have reduced personnel and lowered costs, which has not only not affected production but has also promoted its development. Wanyuan County is one of the key counties in Sichuan Province for producing pig iron. The county has a total of 266 cubic meters of small modern blast furnaces and 53 indigenous blast furnaces. The furnace clusters and mining areas are very scattered, and new workers account for 70%-90%. This year, the county launched a mass movement centered on improving labor productivity. After adjusting the layout of mining areas, technically transforming indigenous blast furnaces, and helping new workers improve their skills, the number of steel production personnel has been reduced from 87,252 in December last year to 45,171. From January to April, the county's daily pig iron output not only did not decrease, but by April it had completed 38.8% of this year's pig iron production plan. Now, all small modern blast furnaces in Wanyuan County only require an average of 78 laborers to produce one ton of iron, and the cost of each ton of pig iron has been reduced to 117 yuan; indigenous blast furnaces only require an average of 134 laborers to produce one ton of iron, and the cost of each ton of pig iron has been reduced to 112 yuan.

    In terms of transportation, by improving vehicle and ship transportation methods, vigorously promoting the construction of "one network and four modernizations" in short-distance transportation, and organizing reasonable transportation, the requirements for material transportation have been guaranteed, and a large number of labor forces have been saved. The Daxian Special District implemented "five fixings" in long-distance and short-distance transportation, and comprehensively adjusted vehicle and ship transportation. Short-distance transportation has established "one network and four modernizations" and implemented the contract-based relay transportation by the commune's professional transportation team from station to station, making the entire special district a complete and tight transportation system. The average daily external transfer of pig iron in this special district has increased from more than 600 tons in the past to more than 1,000 tons, and the transportation front has also transferred more than 30,000 people to support agricultural production.

    The experiences already gained in various parts of Sichuan Province prove that as long as the enterprise party organizations seriously strengthen ideological leadership, mobilize the masses to make careful calculations, offer ideas, and find solutions, the labor potential within enterprises is inexhaustible. For example, the Zigong Chemical Plant originally planned to increase 4,000 people this year because the workload of production and capital construction had greatly increased. After repeated adjustments of labor organization and improvements to equipment and tools, the plant not only did not increase a single labor force but could also transfer some personnel to support other units. The Tianfu Coal Mine planned to need a total of 2,100 coal miners after this year's Great Leap Forward, but the mine only had 986 people. Due to insufficient labor, more than a dozen working faces were forced to stop production. After the mine party committee personally investigated in March, it found that among the mine's 10,792 employees, only 4,898 were raw coal production workers, and coal miners accounted for only 9.14% of the total number of employees; and among the 4,898 raw coal production workers, auxiliary workers accounted for two-thirds. The party committee believed that such a labor organization was obviously very unreasonable, so it immediately launched a large-scale debate among the employees and adopted measures such as adjusting unreasonable labor organizations, merging job types, innovating technology, and compressing some "satellite" factories and non-production projects that were not urgently needed. A total of 1,058 people were transferred to supplement some personnel to the coal miners. After this rectification, the contradiction of insufficient labor in the mine was greatly alleviated. In the nineteen days after the rectification, the daily output of raw coal increased by 27.6% compared with the period before the rectification, and labor productivity increased by 27.3%.

    According to a survey by the relevant departments of Sichuan Province, in the province's steel system, some regions only require an average of 70 or 80 laborers to produce one ton of iron, while others require as many as 700 or 800 or even thousands of people; in some industrial departments, calculated on a three-shift system, each machine tool only needs an average of eight workers, but the provincial average is fourteen people. Even with the addition of management personnel, at least one-third could be reduced this year. Similar situations exist in other industries. Various localities are now continuing to strengthen this work and regard this work as one of the key tasks of the second and third quarters, striving to save more labor forces this year to support the agricultural front, restore urban service industry production, and participate in other work.

    改进劳动组织 提高技术水平 减少企业人员
    四川数十万工人返乡支援农业
    经验证明：加强思想领导，发动群众想办法，企业内部的劳动潜力挖不尽。
    本报成都13日电　四川省工业战线大力抽调人员支援农业生产。各地经过不断改进劳动组织和提高劳动生产率，今年1月到5月份已调出五十万人返回农村和其他生产岗位。6月份内还将继续调出二十多万人。
    1958年四川省开展群众性的全民大办工业运动后，全省工业生产建设都有了空前大发展，职工人数增加得很快。全省县以上的工业、交通运输、基本建设部门1958年职工总人数，比1957年共增加了一点四六倍。今年由于企业管理水平和职工技术水平的提高，一开始各地就抓紧了整顿劳动组织，新建企业的技术改造，发动群众大闹技术革命和技术革新，全面提高劳动生产率。在钢铁战线上，经过大规模地改造土炉群，推广机械化和半机械化代替手工操作，实行并机并炉以后，到5月份为止已抽调出三十七万多人。基本建设部门大力改善劳动组织，革新工具，实行运输车子化，也已节约出十万人投入其他生产部门。
    既抓整顿、改进劳动组织，又抓提高劳动生产率，使许多企业减少了人员，降低了成本，不但没有影响生产，反而促进了生产的发展。万源县是四川省生产生铁的重点县之一。全县共有二百六十六立方公尺的小洋高炉，五十三座土高炉，炉群与矿区很分散，新工人占70％—90％。今年县里开展了以提高劳动生产率为中心的群众运动，经过调整矿区布置，对土高炉进行技术改造，帮助新工人提高技术等一系列措施，钢铁生产人员已从去年12月的八万七千二百五十二人减少到四万五千一百七十一人。1至4月份这个县生铁日产量不但没有降低，而且到4月份为止已完成了今年生铁生产计划的38.8％。现在万源县所有小洋高炉平均每炼一吨铁只占用劳动力七十八人，每吨生铁成本已降低到一百一十七元；土高炉每炼一吨铁只占用劳动力一百三十四人，每吨生铁成本已降低到一百一十二元。
    在交通运输方面，通过改进车、船运输方法，在短途运输上大搞“一网四化”建设，组织合理运输，保证了物资运输要求，又节约了大批劳动力。达县专区在长途运输和短途运输上实行了“五定”，对车、船运输进行了全面调整。短途运输已建设了“一网四化”，并实行由公社专业运输队一站赶一站的包干接力运输，使全专区结成了一个完善严密的运输体系。这个专区今年平均每天的生铁外调量已从过去的六百多吨增加到一千吨以上，运输战线还抽调出三万多人支援农业生产。
    四川省各地目前已经取得的经验证明，只要企业党组织认真加强思想领导，发动群众算细账，出主意，想办法。企业内部的劳动潜力是挖不尽的。例如，自贡化工厂今年因为生产和基本建设工作量大大增加，原计划要增加四千人，厂里经过多次调整劳动组织，改进设备、工具，结果不但没有增加一个劳动力，还可抽出部分人员支援其他单位。天府煤矿今年计划跃进后共需要二千一百名采煤工，而矿上只有九百八十六人，因为劳动力不足，曾经有十多个工作面被迫停产。3月份矿党委亲自摸底后发现，全矿一万零七百九十二名职工中原煤生产工人只有四千八百九十八人，采煤工只占职工总人数的9.14％；而在四千八百九十八名原煤生产工人中辅助工又要占三分之二。党委认为这样的劳动组织显然很不合理，于是立即在职工中展开大辩论，并采取了调整不合理的劳动组织、合并工种、革新技术，压缩一部分“卫星”厂和不是急需的非生产性工程等措施，共调剂出一千零五十八人，补充了一部分人员到采煤工人中去。经过这样整顿后，大大缓和了矿上劳动力不足的矛盾，整顿后的十九天中，原煤日产量就比整顿前提高了27.6％，劳动生产率提高了27.3％。
    据四川省有关主管部门调查，在全省钢铁系统中，有的地区平均每生产一吨铁只占用七、八十个劳动力，有的地区却高达七、八百人甚至上千人；有的工业部门按三班制计算，平均每台机床只需要八个工人，但全省平均却有十四人，即使加上管理人员，今年也至少可以减少三分之一。其他产业也有类似情况。现在各地正在继续加强这方面的工作，并把这个工作作为二至三季度的重点工作之一，争取今年内节约出更多的劳动力支援农业战线，恢复城市服务性行业生产和参加其他工作。
