Two Fresh Flowers in Jinan's Art Scene
　　Liuzi Opera
　　Not long ago, two fresh flowers appeared in Jinan's art scene in Shandong. One is the Liuzi Opera performed by the Pi County Liuzi Opera Troupe, and the other is the Liangjiaxian performed by the Heze Liangjiaxian Troupe.
　　Liuzi Opera is one of the ancient local opera genres in Shandong Province, popular in the border area of Shandong, Jiangsu, and Henan provinces. Before liberation, under the devastation of the enemy, puppets, and the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, Liuzi Opera was in a state of decline with no successors. After liberation, under the guidance of the Party's correct policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and weeding through the old to bring forth the new," Liuzi Opera not only escaped the predicament of having no successors, but has also cultivated a group of excellent young male and female actors (in the past, Liuzi Opera had no female actors). The musical tunes have also been excavated and reorganized, making the stage appearance completely new. Liuzi Opera has a rich repertoire, and its singing is tortuous and melodious, which is highly praised by the audience.
　　Liangjiaxian
　　Liangjiaxian is also one of the excellent local opera genres in Shandong Province. It has a strong folk life atmosphere and easy-to-understand local language. The music and singing are beautiful and pleasant to listen to. Most of the traditional repertoires are folk stories and small family life dramas. Since the Heze Liangjiaxian Troupe implemented the spirit of "walking on two legs," while sorting out the traditional repertoire, it also created and rehearsed some modern repertoires. The performances in Jinan this time include traditional repertoires such as "Brocade Record," "Three Jinshi," "Three Pulling Houses," and "Standing Flower Wall," as well as modern repertoires such as "Red Village."

    济南艺坛的两朵鲜花
    柳子戏
    不久前，山东济南艺坛上出现了两朵鲜花。一个是郫城柳子剧团演出的柳子戏，一个是菏泽两夹弦剧团演出的两夹弦。
    柳子戏是山东省古老的地方剧种之一，流行在山东、江苏、河南三省交界地带。解放前，柳子戏在敌伪、国民党反动统治的摧残下，陷于后继无人、奄奄一息的地步。解放后，在党的“百花齐放，推陈出新”的正确方针的指导下，柳子戏不仅摆脱了后继无人的窘境，并已培养出一批优秀的男女青年演员（过去，柳子戏没有女演员）。音乐曲牌也进行了挖掘整理，使得舞台面目焕然一新。柳子戏剧目丰富，唱腔曲折委婉，极得观众好评。
    两夹弦
    两夹弦，也是山东省优秀的地方剧种之一。它有着浓郁的民间生活气息和通俗易懂的地方语言。音乐唱腔优美动听，传统剧目大多是民间故事及家庭生活小戏。菏泽两夹弦剧团自贯彻了“两条腿走路”的精神后，在整理传统剧目的同时，也创作、排演了部分现代剧目。这次在济南演出的就有“锦缎记”、“三进士”、“三拉房”、“站花墙”等传统剧目和“红色的村庄”等现代剧目。
