    Guangzhou, June 11 (this newspaper) – In the course of carrying out the movement for 1,000 jin of late rice and 10,000 jin of sweet potatoes, Fengxi Commune in Chao'an County, Guangdong Province, adopted the method of cadres and masses jointly summarizing the experience of bumper harvests over the years, establishing high-yield "pacesetter" fields everywhere, and formulating late rice production targets and measures. This greatly encouraged the confidence and enthusiasm of cadres and the masses.
    The specific method of Fengxi Commune is: cadres and masses of each production brigade jointly select a representative high-yield field, and together "dissect the sparrow," analyzing the measures of this field, what can be learned, and what should be improved. After the dissection, a "pacesetter" field is established. Each production team, in looking to the "pacesetter" for an example, divides all the land under its jurisdiction into several small plots according to different conditions such as soil quality, water conservancy, and sunshine. Each plot also establishes a high-yield field as a "pacesetter," summarizes the experience of planting this "pacesetter" field, and then compares it with the experience of the brigade's "pacesetter" field. In this way, they can both absorb the experience of the brigade's "pacesetter" field to make up for deficiencies and give play to their own advantages based on the characteristics and specific experience of the plot. Finally, advanced targets and measures for the plot are determined. According to statistics, a total of more than 9,200 cadres and commune members in this commune participated in specifically summarizing experience, "dissecting" more than 139 mu of rice fields yielding more than 1,000 jin. In the "dissection," the masses voiced more than 45,000 opinions.
    The targets and measures formulated by this commune on the basis of summarizing and popularizing local high-yield experience are considered by everyone to be both positive and稳妥 (wěntuǒ, stable and appropriate). According to statistics, the commune's 23,000 mu of late rice are divided into 345 large plots and more than 1,100 small plots, each with specific targets and measures.
    Because the measures were detailed and specific, all cadres and the masses had a clear direction for their efforts, enhancing the planning of their work and combining soaring enthusiasm with scientific analysis. After Chen A'yang Production Team of Chi Lake Brigade formulated its measures, with respect to seedlings, 20 mu needed to be transplanted, so the team immediately arranged the sowing time, calculated the amount of fertilizer needed, and immediately excavated fertilizer sources and expanded the planting of green manure. After calculations, Yun Guang Brigade found that there was a large shortage of labor, so it immediately mobilized commune members to strive for more workdays.
    Now, Fengxi Commune's late rice preparatory farming movement has been vigorously launched. 40% of the commune's labor force has been投入 (tóurù, invested) in the fertilizer accumulation movement. In the first week of carrying out the "1,000 jin of rice" movement, more than 180,000 dan of various fertilizers were accumulated, and the quality was also good. As of May 23, more than 1,100 mu of late rice had been sown in the commune, accounting for 40% of the late rice seedling fields. (Bi Zhenxing)

    广东枫溪公社队队树立“标兵”田，晚稻播种工作进度快质量好
    本报广州11日电　广东省潮安县枫溪公社在开展千斤晚稻万斤甘薯的运动中，采取干部群众共同总结历年丰产经验，处处树立高产田“标兵”，制订晚稻生产指标和措施的办法，大大鼓舞了干部群众的信心和干劲。
    枫溪公社的具体作法是：由每个生产大队的干部群众一起选择一丘有代表性的高产田，共同“解剖麻雀”，分析这丘田的措施，哪些可以学习，哪些应该改进。解剖以后，就树立“标兵”田。各个生产小队在向“标兵”看齐中，根据土质、水利、阳光等不同条件，将全队所属田地划分为若干个小片，每片也树立一丘高产田为“标兵”，总结出种植本片“标兵”田的经验，再和大队的“标兵”田的经验对照。这样，既可以吸收大队“标兵”田的经验以补不足，又能根据本片的特点和具体经验加以发挥，最后定出本片的先进指标和措施。据统计，这个公社参加具体总结经验的干部和社员共有九千二百多人“解剖”了千斤以上的稻田一百三十九亩。在“解剖”中群众鸣放意见有四万五千多条。
    这个公社在总结和推广当地高产经验的基础上订出来的指标和措施，大家都认为既积极又稳妥。根据统计，全社的二万三千亩晚稻，共分为三百四十五个大片，一千一百多个小片，片片都有具体指标和措施。
    由于措施订得详细具体，全体干部和群众便有了一个明确的努力方向，增强了工作的计划性，使冲天干劲和科学分析结合起来。池湖大队陈阿扬生产小队订出了措施以后，在秧苗方面，需要插秧二十亩，队里就立即安排好播种时间，算出需肥的数量，立即挖掘肥源，扩种绿肥。云光大队经过计算以后，发现欠缺劳力很多，就立即发动社员们争取多做劳动日。
    现在，枫溪公社的晚稻备耕运动已经蓬勃开展。全社40％的劳动力投入了积肥运动。在开展“千斤水稻”运动的第一周，便积得各种肥料十八万多担，质量也好。到5月23日止，全社晚稻已播种一千一百多亩，占晚造秧田的40％。　（梐振兴）
