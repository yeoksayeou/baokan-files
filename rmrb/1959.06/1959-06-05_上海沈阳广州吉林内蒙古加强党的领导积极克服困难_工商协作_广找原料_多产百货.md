Xinhua News Agency, June 4th: Under the leadership of Party organizations, industrial and commercial departments in Shanghai, Shenyang, Guangzhou, Jilin, and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are actively carrying out cooperation, tapping production potential, solving difficulties in raw materials, and doing everything possible to increase the production of daily-use industrial products to meet the needs of the broad masses of people.

In order to produce more daily-use industrial products, these regions have strengthened leadership. The Shanghai Industrial Bureau and Commercial Bureau, industrial specialized companies and commercial procurement and supply stations, as well as factories and stores, have combined production, supply, and sales through holding collaboration meetings, mutual visits, and exhibitions, strengthening leadership over the production of daily-use industrial products. In Shenyang, the CPC Shenyang Municipal Committee, the Municipal People's Committee, and leading cadres from the city's finance, light industry, chemical industry, machinery, and commerce departments formed a leading group, and more than 60 cadres were drawn from relevant units to establish an office. In addition to requiring the units originally producing daily-use industrial products to work hard to produce, nearly 100 privately-run industrial enterprises producing means of production were adjusted to turn to the production of consumer goods. The Industry and Commerce Department of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region also held a meeting to specifically discuss the production of small commodities.

According to market needs, various regions have also made unified arrangements for the production of small commodities. Shenyang arranged for the production of 335 kinds of small commodities in mid-May; in late May, the production of more than 60 kinds of daily necessities was properly arranged, and various daily necessities such as soap, toilet soap, toothpaste, shoe polish, slippers, buckets, rubber shoes, batteries, mothballs, etc., that are needed in the market have been organized by relevant factories to produce as much as possible. Based on the needs of the market and the requirements of the commercial departments, the light industrial factories in Changchun, Jilin Province, arranged for the production of more than 910 kinds of products based on the principles of self-reliance and local material collection, which greatly improved the enthusiasm of more than 120 small and medium-sized factories in the city to produce daily-use industrial products. At the small commodity production meeting held in the second half of May, the Commerce Department and the Light Industry Department of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region also arranged for the production of 206 kinds of small hardware, general merchandise, and knitted goods.

In arranging the production of daily-use industrial products, the industrial and commercial departments in various regions have actively carried out cooperation to solve the difficulties of raw materials, and strive to produce more daily-use industrial products.

Shanghai has adopted methods such as jointly organizing the production of raw materials, promoting substitutes, launching surprise inventory clearing, vigorously engaging in the comprehensive utilization of raw materials, and recycling waste materials to solve many difficulties in raw materials. For example, the purchasing personnel of the Paper Industry Company and relevant commercial departments recently worked together to purchase a large number of wild fibers and waste paper rags in the city and elsewhere. In May, the city's paper production increased by more than 1,300 tons compared with the average monthly output in the first quarter. Some time ago, the Glory Hardware Factory was unable to produce razor blades due to the lack of high-grade alloy steel. The commercial department recently transferred ten tons of allocated scrap steel to them as raw material for smelting alloy steel. As a result, the factory can produce one million high-quality blades.

Shenyang has adopted a combination of internal and external methods, on the one hand, tapping internal potential, and on the other hand, trying to open up external sources. The internal potential is tapped by: 1. Vigorously organizing the recycling of waste materials. The recycled materials currently put into production in the city include more than 600 tons of scrap steel alone. 2. Organizing small factories to link up with large factories and use the remaining scraps from large factories to make small commodities. At present, major factories have reported more than 4,000 tons of scraps, of which more than 950 tons have been allocated to various small factories for production. 3. Mobilizing industry and commerce to clear warehouses, especially the warehouses of privately-run industries, and organizing exchanges and adjustments. 4. Saving and substitution. Mobilizing the masses to vigorously carry out technological revolution and technological innovation to reduce the consumption of raw materials; using substitute materials. 5. Organizing the production of raw materials for civilian products. Shenyang has now begun to produce raw materials for light industry and the chemical industry such as artificial leather, saccharin, and potassium permanganate. In opening up external sources, in addition to the central balance and provincial allocation of materials uniformly allocated by the central government and the province, the relevant municipal departments also sent personnel to Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Henan and other places to purchase a part of the third category of goods to increase the raw materials for the production of daily necessities.

Guangzhou Hardware Products Factory, while ensuring quality, also does everything possible to save raw materials or use substitutes to expand the production of small hardware. For example, the Five Rams Hardware Products Factory used to use hard steel to make barber scissors. When the supply of hard steel was temporarily unavailable, they used clad steel instead, which also guaranteed the quality of the scissors. After many experiments, the workers of the South China Nail Factory changed the past round nails into prismatic nails, which can save 25%-30% of materials, and the nailed items are stronger than the round ones. While saving raw materials and using substitutes, the factories also actively expand the sources of raw materials. At present, more than ten factories have used indigenous steel to produce bicycle parts, steel wires, nails, small locks and other products of good quality. Some factories also make full use of the waste scraps left over from the production of large factories to manufacture small hardware. The Guangzhou Shipyard alone gave the small hardware factories 200 tons of waste scraps of steel, which can be used to make tens of thousands of dozens of small knives, small locks and other supplies.

Light industrial factories in various parts of Jilin Province have also solved many difficulties in raw materials by adopting the method of mutual learning. Yanji Shoe Factory learned from the experience of shoe factories in Jinzhou, Taonan and other places, and used gypsum and talc powder instead of grain and leather nitrate in the process of making leather, saving 7,000 catties of grain and 4,000 catties of leather nitrate. The cooked leather produced is softer and more durable than before. Changchun Enamel Factory used lime instead of fluorite, which solved the shortage of chemical raw materials, and the product quality also met the requirements. In the production increase and conservation movement, the paper machine workshop of Jilin Paper Mill solved the waste of pulp and the use of woolen cloth and machinery, and completed the plan seven days ahead of schedule in May.

Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has proposed that in addition to grasping the production, allocation, and storage of raw materials, it is also necessary to adopt methods such as excavation, conservation, substitution, comprehensiveness, and collaboration to vigorously tap the potential of local resources and raw material production, rationally utilize raw materials, utilize substitutes, and give play to the communist spirit of cooperation among factories and relevant departments to make up for each other's deficiencies.

    上海沈阳广州吉林内蒙古加强党的领导积极克服困难
    工商协作　广找原料　多产百货
    据新华社4日讯　上海、沈阳、广州、吉林和内蒙古自治区等地的工业和商业部门在党组织的领导下，积极开展协作，挖掘生产潜力，解决原料、材料困难，千方百计增产日用工业品，以满足广大人民的需要。
    为了更多地生产日用工业品，这些地区都加强了领导。上海工业局和商业局，工业专业公司和商业采购供应站，以及工厂和商店之间，经过召开协作会议、互相访问、举行展览会，把供产销结合在一起，加强对日用品工业生产的领导。沈阳市由中共沈阳市委、市人民委员会和沈阳市财经、轻工、化工、机械、商业等部门的领导干部组成领导小组，从有关单位抽调六十多名干部成立了办公室，除了要求原来生产日用工业品的单位要努力生产外，还调整了近百家制做生产资料的民办工业，转向生活资料用品的生产。内蒙古自治区工业和商业厅还召开了会议，专门讨论了小商品生产。
    根据市场的需要，各地对小商品生产也作了统一安排。沈阳市在5月中旬安排了三百三十五种小商品生产；5月下旬，又有六十多种日常生活用品生产得到了妥善安排，对市场需要的肥皂、香皂、牙膏、鞋油、便鞋、水桶、胶鞋、电池、卫生球等各种日用品，都已组织有关工厂尽多生产。吉林省长春市的轻工业工厂根据市场需要和商业部门的要求，本着自力更生、就地取材的原则，安排了九百一十多种产品的生产，大大提高了全市一百二十多个中小工厂生产日用工业品的积极性。内蒙古自治区商业厅和轻工业厅，在5月下半月举行的小商品生产会议上，也安排了二百零六种小五金、百货和针织品等商品的生产。
    在安排日用工业品的生产中，各地工业和商业部门都积极地开展协作，解决原料材料的困难，力争生产更多的日用工业品。
    上海市采取共同组织原料材料生产、推广代用品、突击清仓，大搞原料综合利用，回收废品旧料等办法，解决了许多原料材料的困难。如造纸工业公司和有关商业部门的采购人员，最近一起动手，在本市和外地购到大批野生纤维和破布废纸，五月份全市的纸张生产就比第一季度的每月平均产量提高一千三百多吨。光荣五金厂前些时候由于缺少高级合金钢，无法生产刮胡子的刀片，商业部门最近从分配到的废钢材中给他们调去了十吨，作为炼合金钢的原料，这个厂因此可以生产一百万片优质的刀片。
    沈阳市采取了内外并举的方法，一面挖掘内部潜力，一面想法开辟外源。在挖掘内部潜力方面用的是：一、大力组织废旧物资回收。全市现在投入生产的回收物资，仅废钢铁就有六百多吨。二、组织小厂与大厂挂钩，利用大厂使剩的边角废料做小商品。现在各大厂汇报的边角废料有四千多吨，其中有九百五十多吨已经分配到各小厂生产了。三、动员工商业清理仓库，特别是民办工业的仓库，组织串换调剂。四、节约代用。发动群众大搞技术革命和技术革新，降低原材料消耗；采用代用材料。五、组织民用产品原料生产。现在沈阳市已开始制出人造革、糖精、高锰酸钾等轻工业和化学工业原料。在开辟外源方面，除了中央平衡和省拨的物资由中央和省统一调拨外，市有关部门还派出人员到新疆、内蒙古、河南等地采购一部分第三类商品，增加日用品生产的原料。
    广州市五金制品工厂在保证质量的前提下，也千方百计地节约原料、材料或采用代用品，扩大小五金生产。如制造理发条剪原来要用硬钢，五羊五金制品厂在硬钢一时供应不上的情况下，采用了夹钢代替，同样保证了条剪的质量。华南钉厂职工经过多次试验，把过去的圆钉改成棱形钉后，可以节省材料25％—30％，钉的东西还比圆的牢固。在节约原料、材料和采用代用品的同时，各厂还积极扩大原料、材料的来源。目前已有十多个厂用土钢生产出了质量良好的自行车零件、钢丝、钉、小锁等产品。有些厂还充分利用大厂生产剩下的废碎料来制造小五金。仅广州造船厂就给了各小五金厂两百吨废碎的钢材，可以用来制成上万打的小刀小锁等用品。
    吉林省各地轻工业工厂采取互相学习的办法，也解决了不少原材料的困难。延吉市制鞋厂学习锦州、洮南等地鞋工厂的经验，在制熟皮的过程中利用石膏、滑石粉代替粮食和皮硝，节约了七千斤粮食和四千斤皮硝，制出的熟皮比过去的还柔软、耐用些。长春市搪瓷厂利用石灰代替莹石，解决了化工原料不足的困难，产品质量也达到了要求。吉林市造纸厂抄纸车间在增产节约运动中，解决了纸浆流失和毛布、机械使用方面的浪费问题，5月份提前七天完成了计划。
    内蒙古自治区提出除了要抓原料材料的生产、调度、保管以外，还要采用挖、节、代、综、协等办法，大力挖掘地方资源和原料材料生产的潜力，合理利用原料材料，利用代用品，发挥各厂之间、各有关部门之间调剂有无的共产主义协作精神。（附图片）
