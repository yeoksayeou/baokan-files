After the basic quelling of the Tibetan rebellion, a brand new era has begun to dawn for Tibetan children. Many children of serfs and slaves are entering schools for the first time, more than a thousand Tibetan children have donned red scarves, and young children are singing songs such as "The East is Red," "Socialism is Good," and "The Kashag is Rotten to the Core."

In the long, dark years of the past, the suffering endured by Tibetan children under the oppression of the feudal serf system was shocking. Many Tibetan children were born in tattered tents, filthy stables, and cattle pens, some even in the wilderness and on post roads. Parents constantly burdened with heavy corvée labor for feudal lords rarely had the chance to care for their children. Some parents, when fulfilling corvée duties, had to dig a hole in the ground and put their children in it, or tie them to a tree with rawhide ropes. The children cried their hearts out, while the mothers toiled under the whips of the feudal lords in inhuman labor. In winter, ice and snow covered the Tibetan Plateau, and the piercing cold wind felt like sharp knives. At this time, many Tibetan children were still naked, huddled in tents or low mud huts, crying from hunger and cold. Especially in pastoral areas, such tragic scenes were common. A few years ago, while reporting in pastoral areas, I often saw naked children running out of tents to stare at passersby. These children were covered in cow dung and dirt, with only two dark eyes visible.

Under the attack of hunger, cold, and disease, the infant mortality rate in Tibet was shockingly high. The survival rate of infants could not keep up with the mortality rate of adults, so the population of Tibet was decreasing year by year. According to a survey conducted in Thirty-Nine Clan Jiasa Village (eleven households) after the peaceful liberation of Tibet in 1952, ten years ago, Jiasa Village had sixty-nine adults. Ten years later, there were only fifty people in total, including adults and children. The mortality rate of children born within ten years was 62%, and three of the surviving children were born with disabilities.

Tibetan children who were not deprived of their lives by hunger, cold, and disease in infancy still faced immense suffering. "A slave's child is still a slave, a serf's child is still a serf," was the "golden rule" of the Tibetan feudal serf system. Children of serfs and slaves inherited their parents' debts from a young age, became serfs and slaves from a young age, and began heavy physical labor from a young age. In the manors of serf owners, in the official yamen of the reactionary regime, and on the pastures of feudal lords, children were engaged in arduous corvée duties such as herding, farming, construction, and transportation. Innocent and lively children shouldered heavy burdens of life, and the suffering of life cast a terrible shadow on their young minds. Their physical and mental development was severely damaged. Some children were twelve or thirteen years old, but their height was the same as that of normally developed eight- or nine-year-olds, while their faces looked like those of fifteen- or sixteen-year-olds.

In the past, there were many vagrant children and orphans in Tibet. Groups of vagrant children wandered the streets of Lhasa, some playing the horse-tail fiddle and dancing along the streets, begging for alms. They danced barefoot on the ground, their feet bleeding, their voices hoarse, and they rarely received any charity from the serf owners.

Today, the days of Tibetan children being ravaged are gone forever. At the garden party in Lhasa celebrating "June 1st" International Children's Day, the joyous scenes of Tibetan children were touching.

In the ranks of Lhasa City's Third Elementary School, there was a student named Qiangba Zhuoga. A few months ago, she was still living a life of enslavement in the manor of a serf owner. Qiangba Zhuoga's father was forced to death by the serf owner when she was four years old, and her mother died when she was six. The orphaned Qiangba Zhuoga began to work as a laborer for the serf owner. After the Lhasa rebellion was quelled, this orphan was liberated from the serf owner's whip and entered Lhasa Third Elementary School. The school provides her with all food, clothing, and educational expenses. Qiangba Zhuoga has repeatedly expressed to her teachers that she will study hard and strive to join the Young Pioneers as soon as possible.

There is also an eleven-year-old child named Tudan Renzeng in the Third Elementary School, who was originally a vagrant child on the streets of Lhasa. When the Lhasa rebellion broke out, he hid in the fields on the outskirts of the city and did not eat anything for three days. After the rebellion was quelled, the Lhasa Military Control Commission introduced him to the Third Elementary School. On "June 1st," he wore the clothes issued by the school and happily played with his classmates. Everyone who knew this child in the past praised the Communist Party as the reborn parents of Tibetan children.

The emcee of the garden party, Luobu Zhangdan, a student at Lhasa Second Elementary School, excitedly announced the program of the conference in front of the loudspeaker. He is the son of a slave from Baima Gang in southern Tibet. His parents were beaten to death alive by the serf owner with whips because they could not afford corvée labor, and the serf owner also grabbed him to be a slave. In 1956, Luobu Zhangdan could not bear the abuse of the serf owner and secretly ran away. Luobu Zhangdan said: "Before the Lhasa rebellion was quelled, we sons of slaves did not dare to go out on the streets, for fear of being caught back by the slave owners. Now, the reactionary Kashag has been overthrown, and we walk swaggeringly on the streets, no longer afraid of anyone invading us."

    西藏儿童的苦难和欢乐
    新华社记者　宗子度
    西藏叛乱基本平息以后，一个崭新的时代开始出现在西藏儿童的面前。许多农奴、奴隶的子女第一次走进了学校，一千多个西藏儿童戴上了红领巾，少年儿童们唱起了“东方红”、“社会主义好”和“噶厦坏透了”等歌曲。
    在过去漫长的黑暗岁月里，西藏儿童在封建农奴制度压榨下所经受的种种苦难，令人触目惊心。许多西藏儿童诞生在破烂的帐篷、肮脏的马厩和牛圈里，有的甚至诞生在旷野和驿道上。常年为封建领主繁重的差役奔忙的父母们，很少能照顾自己的孩子。有的父母在支差役时，只好在地上挖一个洞，把孩子放在里面，或者用牛皮绳把孩子拴在树上，孩子哭得死去活来，母亲却在封建领主的皮鞭下进行非人的劳动。冬天，冰雪复盖着西藏高原，凛冽的寒风像尖刀一样。这时，不少藏族儿童依然赤身裸体，蜷缩在帐篷或低矮的小土屋里啼饥号寒。特别是在牧区，这样悲惨的情景随处可见。前几年冬天，记者在牧区采访时，常常看到有赤条条的小孩跑到帐篷外边来张望过路的行人。这些儿童的身上和脸上粘着牛粪和泥土，只看见两个乌黑的眼珠在转动。
    在饥寒和疾病的侵袭下，西藏婴儿的死亡率高得惊人，婴儿的成活率赶不上成年人的死亡率，因此，西藏人口逐年在减少。据三十九族甲萨村（十一户人家）在1952年西藏和平解放后的调查统计，十年前，甲萨村有六十九个成年人，十年后成年人和儿童一起才五十人。十年内出生儿童的死亡率为62％，活下来的儿童中有三个还是先天的残废。
    没有被饥寒和疾病在婴儿时期夺去生命的西藏儿童，活下来也是苦难重重。“奴隶的子女还是奴隶，农奴的子女还是农奴”，这是西藏封建农奴制度的“金科玉律”。农奴和奴隶的子女从小就继承着父母的债务，从小就当农奴和奴隶，从小就开始了过重的体力劳动。在农奴主的庄园里，在反动政权的官府衙门中，在封建领主的牧场上，都有儿童在从事放牧、耕作、修建、运输等艰巨的差役。天真活泼的孩子负起了沉重的生活重担，生活的苦难在他们幼小的心灵上投下了可怕的阴影，他们的身心发育遭到了严重的摧残。有的儿童十二三岁了，身材还和正常发育的八九岁的孩子一样高，而他们的面容看起来却像十五六岁的孩子。
    过去，在西藏各地都有很多流浪儿和孤儿。成群的流浪儿在拉萨街头踯躅徘徊，有的拉着马尾琴沿街跳舞，向人乞讨。他们赤着脚在地上跳着，脚磨出了血，嗓子嘶哑了，也很少见到从农奴主那里得到一点施舍。
    今天，西藏儿童遭受摧残的日子一去不复返了。在拉萨市庆祝“六一”国际儿童节游园大会上，西藏儿童欢乐的景象令人感动。
    在拉萨市第三小学的队伍里，有一个名叫强巴卓噶的小学生，几个月前，她还在农奴主的庄园里过着被奴役的痛苦生活。强巴卓噶四岁时父亲给农奴主逼死了，六岁时又死去了母亲。孤苦的强巴卓噶就开始给农奴主作苦工。拉萨叛乱平息后，这个孤儿从农奴主的皮鞭下解放出来，进入拉萨第三小学，学校供给她一切吃穿和学习费用。强巴卓噶多次向老师表示她一定努力学习，争取早日加入少先队。
    第三小学还有一个十一岁的孩子土丹仁增，原是拉萨街头的流浪儿。拉萨叛乱发生时，他躲在城郊的田野里，三天没有吃一点东西。叛乱平息后，拉萨军管会把他介绍到第三小学读书。“六一”这天，他穿着学校发给的衣服，欢欢喜喜地和同学们在一起玩乐。凡是过去认识这个孩子的人，莫不称赞共产党是西藏儿童的再生父母。
    游园大会的小司仪、拉萨第二小学学生洛布章丹兴奋地站在扩音器前宣布大会的程序。他是西藏南部白马岗一个奴隶的儿子。他的父母因无力支应差役被农奴主用皮鞭活活打死，农奴主又把他自己抓去当奴隶。1956年，洛布章丹不堪农奴主的虐待，偷偷逃跑了出来。洛布章丹说：“拉萨叛乱平息以前，我们这些奴隶的儿子不敢上街外出，生怕被奴隶主抓回去，现在。反动的噶厦被打倒了，我们大摇大摆地在街上走，再也不怕有谁来侵犯我们了。”（附图片）
