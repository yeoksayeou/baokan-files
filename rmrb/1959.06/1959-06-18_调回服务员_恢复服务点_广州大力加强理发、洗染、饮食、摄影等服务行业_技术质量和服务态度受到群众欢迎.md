Guangzhou, June 17th (reported by this newspaper) Under the direct leadership of the Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the barbering, laundry and dyeing, catering, and photography service industries in Guangzhou have recently been actively adopting various measures to restore and develop their businesses.

Due to the improvement of living standards, the people of Guangzhou have continuously put forward more and higher demands on the service industries. For example, the turnover of the barbering, laundry and dyeing, and photography industries (excluding cooperative stores) was more than 1.34 million yuan in the first half of last year, and increased to more than 1.92 million yuan in the second half, an increase of 43%. In the first quarter of this year, it further increased to 1.38 million yuan, an increase of 44% compared with the average quarterly turnover in the third and fourth quarters of last year. In addition, when the commercial network was adjusted last year, some service stores were closed and merged, and a group of technicians and skilled personnel were transferred to the steel and other industrial sectors. As a result, a certain contradiction arose between the quantity and quality of services and the needs. After the Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China recently discovered and analyzed the above situation, it immediately strengthened specific leadership and took effective measures in a timely manner, striving to quickly improve the work of the service industries in a short period of time.

The Guangzhou Municipal Committee first stipulated that skilled and experienced personnel among the employees of the barbering, laundry and dyeing, catering, and photography industries who were transferred out last year should return to their original positions according to actual needs. The Municipal Committee also stipulated that when increasing service points, barbering services should mainly be added inside units with large numbers of people such as government agencies, organizations, industrial and mining enterprises, schools, and nurseries to facilitate production and work; barber shops on main streets that were removed during the adjustment of the store network should also be restored. The laundry and dyeing industry should vigorously develop private laundry and dyeing service points; some new laundry and dyeing service points should also be appropriately added on main streets; existing service points, as long as conditions permit, can also expand their business as needed.

The Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China gave strong support and solutions to the required raw materials and special equipment for these restored and newly added industries. In addition to instructing relevant supply units to allocate a certain amount of steel and electrical materials to quickly process and manufacture barbering tools and machinery and equipment for high-end laundries, it has recently appropriately supplied materials needed daily by the barbering and laundry and dyeing industries, such as cosmetics, soap, dyes, and starch. The Municipal Committee has instructed relevant departments to assist in overcoming the difficulties encountered by these industries in restoring and adding service points due to a lack of housing.

After Guangzhou adopted these measures, 59 barber shops have been added in the urban area alone, and 14 self-managed barber shops have been established with the help of government agencies, organizations, industrial and mining enterprises, nurseries and other units, adding a total of 457 employees. In terms of the laundry and dyeing industry, 55 private laundry and dyeing shops have been added and restored to normal production, with a total of 325 people. It has also been decided to add and expand a batch of high-end and ordinary barbering, laundry and dyeing, catering, and photography shops, some of which are being planned.

These newly added and restored service points have made citizens feel more convenient. For example, not long ago, it often took seven to ten days for a laundry to wash an ordinary suit, but now it generally only takes three days. In the past, getting a haircut often required waiting an hour at the barber shop, but now it generally does not exceed half an hour, and some streets can even provide haircuts on demand. The newly added barber shops in government agencies, organizations, industrial and mining enterprises, nurseries and other units have made it much more convenient for employees, family members, and children to get haircuts than in the past.

In order to further improve the service quality of these industries, the relevant commercial departments in Guangzhou have also formulated different specific service quality standards by industry and by grade through pilot programs. At present, the barbering industry has fully formulated service quality standards. The first branch of the No. 1 branch of the Xinlian Barbering Shop has recently conducted a serious rectification of its service work, and has significantly improved in terms of technical quality, service attitude, cleanliness and hygiene, and materials used. The masses generally expressed satisfaction.

    调回服务员  恢复服务点
    广州大力加强理发、洗染、饮食、摄影等服务行业
    技术质量和服务态度受到群众欢迎
    本报广州17日电  广州市理发、洗染、饮食和摄影等服务行业，最近在中共广州市委的直接领导下，积极采取各种措施恢复和发展业务。
    由于生活的改善，广州市人民对服务行业不断提出了更多、更高的要求。例如理发、洗染、摄影等三个行业的营业额（不包括合作商店），去年上半年是一百三十四万多元，而下半年增加到一百九十二万多元，增长43％，今年第一季度再增为一百三十八万元，又比去年第三、四季度平均季营业额增长44％。加上去年调整商业网时，撤并了一部分服务店，调出了一批技工和业务熟练的人员到钢铁等工业部门，结果，服务的数量与质量同需要之间就发生了一定的矛盾。中共广州市委最近发现和分析了上述情况后，立即加强具体领导，及时采取有效措施，力争在较短的时间内迅速改善服务行业的工作。
    广州市委首先规定：去年调出的理发、洗染、饮食、摄影业的职工中，有技术和业务熟练的人员，都应根据实际的需要，回到原来的岗位上去。市委同时规定，在增加服务点时，理发业主要应在机关、团体、工矿企业、学校和托儿所等人数较多的单位内部增设，以利生产和工作；主要街道上的理发店，在调整店业网时撤掉的，也应一律恢复。洗染业要大力发展民办洗染服务点；主要街道也要适当增设一些洗染新服务点；现有的服务点，只要有条件，也可根据需要扩充业务。
    中共广州市委对这些恢复、增设的行业所需原材料和专用设备，给予大力支持和解决。除了责成有关供应单位拨给一定数量的钢材、电料赶紧加工制造理发用具和高级洗衣店的机器设备外，最近对理发、洗染业日常需要的物料，如化妆品、肥皂、染料和浆粉等，都适当给予供应。对这些行业在恢复和增设服务点时碰到缺房子的困难，市委已指示有关部门协助克服。
    广州市采取这些措施后，最近仅在市区增设的理发店就有五十九所，帮助机关、团体、工矿企业、托儿所等单位自办理发室十四间，共增加从业人员四百五十七人。洗染业方面，已增加和恢复正常生产的民办洗染店五十五户，共三百二十五人。目前还决定新增加和扩大一批高级和普通的理发、洗染、饮食和摄影店，部分已在筹设中。
    这些增设和恢复的服务点，已使市民群众感到方便。例如，不久前洗染店洗一套普通便服，往往要七天至十天时间，现在一般只要三天的时间就可以了。过去，理一次发，往往要在理发店等候一个小时，现在一般不超过半小时，有的街道还可以做到随时到随时理发。新增设理发室的机关、团体、工矿企业和托儿所等单位，职工、家属和儿童理发比过去方便得多了。
    为了进一步提高这些行业的服务质量，广州市有关的商业部门还按行业、按等级，通过试点，制订不同的具体服务质量标准。目前，理发行业已经全面制订好了服务质量标准。理发业一新联店第一支店最近对服务工作认真进行整顿后，在技术质量、服务态度、清洁卫生和用料方面都显著改善，群众普遍表示满意。（附图片）
