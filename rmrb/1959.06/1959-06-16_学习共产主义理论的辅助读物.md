    China Youth Publishing House has recently published the book "Studying Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin on the Theory of Communism." This is a popular reading material that comprehensively and systematically expounds the theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin regarding communism. Starting with an overview of the emergence and development of scientific communist thought, the book provides detailed expositions on some important issues related to communism, such as: the material foundation of communist society, the ideological awareness and moral character of communism, issues of family, marriage and women, the reduction and elimination of differences between manual and mental labor, as well as accumulation and consumption, and the development of cultural and educational undertakings, and so on.
    One of the characteristics of this book's exposition is: it closely links with our country's current social life; and it also makes expositions in connection with the new developments in communist theory, especially the "Resolution on Several Questions Concerning People's Communes" adopted by the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and several new theoretical issues raised in the documents of the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.
    This book can be used as a supplementary reading material for studying the book "Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin on Communist Society."

    学习共产主义理论的辅助读物
    中国青年出版社最近出版了“学习马克思恩格斯列宁斯大林关于共产主义的理论”一书。这是一本全面、系统地阐述马克思恩格斯列宁斯大林关于共产主义理论的通俗读物。书中从概述科学共产主义思想的产生和发展开始，对于有关共产主义的一些重要问题，例如：共产主义社会的物质基础，共产主义的思想觉悟和道德品质，家庭婚姻和妇女问题，体力劳动和脑力劳动的差别的缩小和消灭问题，以及积累和消费、文化和教育事业的发展等等问题，分别作了详细的阐述。
    这本书在阐述中的一个特点是：密切联系了我国当前的社会生活；并且对于共产主义理论的新发展，特别是中共八届六中全会通过的“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”，以及苏共第二十一次代表大会文件中所提出的若干新的理论问题，也联系着作了阐述。
    这本书可以作为学习“马克思恩格斯列宁斯大林论共产主义社会”一书的辅助读物。
