　　Hanoi News: The agricultural cooperativization movement in Vietnam is surging forward with unprecedented speed.

　　As of May 1959, over 13,400 agricultural production cooperatives had been established throughout North Vietnam, with peasant households participating in agricultural production cooperatives accounting for 16% of the total number of peasant households, nearly quadrupling since the beginning of this year. At the start of the spring plowing season this year, Hai Duong province had only 346 agricultural production cooperatives, with cooperative households accounting for 8% of the total number of peasant households. Now, it has increased to 1,332 agricultural production cooperatives, with cooperative households accounting for 42% of the total number of peasant households. This is currently the province with the most agricultural production cooperatives in North Vietnam. At the end of March, Hung Yen province had a total of 231 agricultural production cooperatives, which has now grown to 860. Thai Binh province has grown from 221 to 1,310. The Vinh Linh area, close to the 17th parallel, has now basically achieved cooperativization, with cooperative households accounting for over 80% of the total number of peasant households in the area. In recent days, peasants in many villages in Hung Yen, Bac Ninh, Thai Binh and other provinces have also been celebrating the bumper harvest of early rice with drums and gongs, and celebrating the establishment of new agricultural production cooperatives in batches.

　　In the mountainous areas of northern Vietnam, the mutual aid and cooperation movement had been developing relatively slowly in the past. Since the beginning of this year, the cooperativization movement has also been developing rapidly along with the plains. As of the end of April, the Viet Bac Autonomous Region had established nearly 600 agricultural production cooperatives, many of which have basically achieved cooperativization. In addition, 62% of peasant households have participated in labor exchange teams; the number of year-round labor exchange teams implementing work evaluation and point recording has also doubled compared to the end of last year. The Thai-Meo Autonomous Region has now established 78 advanced and elementary agricultural production cooperatives, nearly doubling since the beginning of this year. More than 3,000 year-round labor exchange teams have also been established throughout the region, doubling the number from last year.

　　The main reason for the rapid development of the cooperativization movement is that the Vietnamese Labor Party attaches importance to leading the cooperativization movement and raising the political and ideological awareness of the rural masses. Recently, the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Labor Party and party committees at all levels have further strengthened political and ideological education in rural areas and specific leadership over the mutual aid and cooperation movement. On May 18th this year, the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Labor Party issued a communique from the Sixteenth (Enlarged) Plenary Session of the Central Committee, stating that the meeting focused on discussing agricultural cooperativization and the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce. The meeting believed that since the end of 1958, important changes tending towards socialism have emerged in the rural areas of northern Vietnam. The Sixteenth Session of the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Labor Party proposed that the urgent task of the Party in the rural areas of northern Vietnam is to consolidate existing labor exchange teams and cooperatives when the current socialist trend in rural areas has a new increase, and to make preparations in terms of direction, policies, ideology, organization, cadres, and plans in order to actively and steadily develop the agricultural cooperativization movement, prepare for the arrival of a high tide of socialist revolution in rural areas, and strive for the victorious completion of the socialist transformation of agriculture.

　　Truong Chinh, a member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Labor Party, said at the Tenth Session of the Vietnamese National Assembly held in May that we are fighting for the unification of the country and for carrying out socialist revolution in the North. In the socialist revolution, we attach great importance to the work of carrying out socialist transformation of non-socialist economic components. Truong Chinh then emphasized that in the current entire socialist transformation work in northern Vietnam, agricultural cooperativization is a major link. If agricultural cooperativization is done well, it will create favorable conditions for other aspects of transformation work and even all of our work. The Tenth Session of the National Assembly passed a resolution on the issue of agricultural cooperativization, instructing the government to strengthen its leadership over the agricultural cooperativization movement, and to make governments at all levels and departments fully recognize the importance of the current socialist revolution in the northern rural areas. At the same time, it should recognize its own responsibility for the agricultural cooperativization movement, and serve the vigorously developing agricultural cooperativization movement in a timely manner. The resolution called on all cadres, troops, and people to enthusiastically support the agricultural cooperativization movement in order to guide northern Vietnam onto the path of socialism, as a strong foundation for the struggle to unify the motherland.

　　The people of northern Vietnam warmly welcomed the call of the Central Committee of the Labor Party and the resolution of the National Assembly. One hundred and forty-nine members of the Qi Xi Agricultural Cooperative in Qinghe County, Hai Duong Province, wrote to the National Assembly saying that since the establishment of the agricultural production cooperative, the superiority of collective production has been brought into play. Since the early rice crop last year, members have not only been able to implement close planting and more fertilization, increasing the yield of early rice by 363 kilograms per mu, but also expanded the cultivated area. Some members' incomes have more than doubled compared to before. All members of the Labor Party, members of the Administrative Committee, members of the People's Council, and agricultural labor models in Dongmei Township, Thai Binh Province, wrote to the National Assembly reporting that their township has established 18 agricultural production cooperatives, with 52% of peasant households joining the cooperatives. All party members and cadres have joined the cooperatives, and 95% of peasant households who have not joined the cooperatives have also participated in labor exchange teams. This year's early rice harvest is not only unprecedented, but even better than the best harvest of 1958. In order to express their determination to implement the resolution of the National Assembly, farmers in many places have sent telegrams and letters to the National Assembly, proposing specific measures to ensure the successful completion of the current tasks, to complete the summer harvest well and quickly, and to actively prepare for the late rice planting, especially to consolidate and develop agricultural production cooperatives and labor exchange teams through the summer harvest and autumn plowing.

　　Another reason for the rapid development of the cooperativization movement is that the original agricultural production cooperatives fully demonstrated their superiority in agricultural production last winter and this spring, thus attracting more and more farmers.

　　This year's early rice in various provinces generally grew better than in previous years, and in many areas it even grew better than last year's late rice. This was previously considered impossible. For example, Bac Giang Province has now completed the harvesting of 35,000 hectares of summer rice. Judging from the pilot harvesting, the average yield per hectare in the province can reach 2,300 to 2,500 kilograms, an increase of 15% compared to last year's best late rice harvest, and an increase of 30% to 35% compared to the early rice harvest in 1958. Many agricultural cooperatives in Xiehe, Anyong, Fuliangshang and other counties and cities generally harvested 2,700 to 3,000 kilograms of early rice per hectare. The yield of early rice per hectare in Thanh Hoa province this year generally increased by 500 to 1,000 kilograms compared to last year. The harvests of cooperatives are better than those of labor exchange teams and individual farmers. The average yield per hectare of land in the Chen Fu Cooperative is 5,000 kilograms, which is 2,000 kilograms higher than that of mutual aid teams. The bumper harvest of early rice in various provinces is due to the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement in production last winter and this spring, which ensured timely water storage, eliminated the threat of drought, and also realized new cultivation methods of deep plowing, close planting, and more fertilization. For example, the Qi Hai Cooperative in Qi Ying County, Ha Tinh Province, has a piece of land of 25 mu and 5 li 6 fen, which has a very poor geological structure. In the past, it was often exempted from agricultural tax due to poor harvest. This year, after the members improved the soil, deeply plowed and planted closely, and applied sufficient fertilizer, the result, including other crops, is equivalent to a harvest of 3,100 kilograms of grain per hectare.

　　At present, the early rice of the agricultural production cooperatives established before the spring plowing will soon be harvested. Judging from the overall situation, the yield per unit area of agricultural production cooperatives is much higher than that of labor exchange teams and individual households; the income of members has generally increased. Therefore, recently many individual households in many places have applied to join the cooperatives.

　　Due to the urgent demand of farmers to join cooperatives, it is expected that by the end of June this year, many provinces will have cooperatives in every township, as a basis for further expanding the cooperativization movement in the second half of the year.

    越南农业合作化运动空前发展
    现已建立一万三千多个农业社比年初增加将近四倍
    劳动党加强了对运动的领导和农村的政治思想工作
    本报讯　河内消息：越南的农业合作化运动正在风起云涌，出现前所未有的发展速度。
    截至1959年5月，全北越共建立了一万三千四百多个农业生产合作社，参加农业生产合作社的农户已占农户总数的16％，比今年年初增加将近四倍。今年春耕开始时，海阳省还只有三百四十六个农业生产合作社，入社农户占农户总数的8％，现在已经增加到一千三百三十二个农业生产合作社，入社农户占农户总数的42％。这是目前北越农业生产合作社最多的省份。兴安省3月底共有二百三十一个农业生产合作社，现在发展到八百六十个，太平省从二百二十一个发展到一千三百一十个。靠近十七度纬线的永灵区，目前已经基本上实现合作化，入社农户占全区农户总数的80％以上。兴安、北宁、太平等省许多乡村的农民近日来还敲锣打鼓，庆祝早稻的大丰收，庆祝成批成批的新的农业生产合作社的成立。
    在越南北方的山区，过去互助合作运动一直发展得比较慢。今年以来，合作化运动也跟着平原地区迅速发展起来了。截至4月底为止，越北自治区已经建立了将近六百个农业生产合作社，其中许多乡已经基本上实现了合作化。此外，已有62％的农户参加了变工组；实行评工记分的常年变工组的数量也比去年底增长了一倍。傣族苗族自治区目前已经建立了七十八个高级和低级农业生产合作社，比今年年初增加了将近两倍。全区还建立了三千多个常年变工组，比去年增加了一倍。
    合作化运动迅速发展的主要原因，是越南劳动党重视对合作化运动的领导和农村群众政治思想觉悟的提高。最近，越南劳动党中央和各级党委更进一步加强在农村中的政治思想教育工作和对互助合作运动的具体领导。今年5月18日，越南劳动党中央发表的中央委员会第十六次（扩大）会议公报说，这次会议着重讨论了农业合作化和对资本主义工商业社会主义改造问题。会议认为：自1958年年底以来，越南北方的农村已经出现了趋向社会主义的重要变化。越南劳动党中央第十六次会议提出，党在越南北方的农村的迫切任务，是在目前农村社会主义趋势有了新的增长的时候，努力巩固现有的变工组和合作社，并在方针、政策、思想、组织、干部和计划各方面作好准备，以便积极和稳步地发展农业合作化运动，为农村社会主义革命高潮的到来作好准备，为胜利地完成农业的社会主义改造而奋斗。
    越南劳动党中央政治局委员长征在5月间召开的越南国会第十次会议上说，我们正在为统一国家和在北方进行社会主义革命而斗争。在社会主义革命中，我们非常重视对非社会主义经济成份进行社会主义改造的工作。长征接着强调说：在越南北方目前的整个社会主义改造工作中，农业合作化是一个主要的环节。农业合作化搞好了，也就为其他方面的改造工作以至我们的全部工作创造了有利的条件。国会第十次会议通过了关于农业合作化问题的决议，责成政府加强对农业合作化运动的领导，并使各级政权、各部门充分认识到当前北方农村社会主义革命的重要意义。同时认清自己对农业合作化运动的责任，及时为正在蓬勃发展中的农业合作化运动服务。决议号召全体干部、部队和人民热烈支持农业合作化运动，以便引导越南北方走上社会主义，作为统一祖国斗争的强固基础。
    越南北方各地人民对劳动党中央的号召和国会的决议表示热烈欢迎。海阳省清河县奇西乡农业合作社一百四十九个社员写信给国会说，由于成立了农业生产合作社，发挥集体生产的优越性，因此从去年早造以来，社员们不仅能够实现密植、多施肥，使每亩早稻增产三百六十三公斤，而且还扩大了耕地面积。有的社员收入比以前增加一倍多。太平省东美乡全体劳动党党员、行政委员会委员、人民议会议员、农业劳模等写信向国会报告他们乡已经成立了十八个农业生产合作社，52％的农户入了社，所有党员和干部都已入社，没有参加合作社的农户，也有95％参加变工组。今年早造丰产不仅为过去所未见，就连收成最好的1958年也比不上。为了表示实现国会决议的决心，许多地方的农民，纷纷打电报和写信给国会，提出具体措施，保证良好地完成当前各项工作，又好又快地完成夏收，积极做好晚稻备耕工作，特别是要通过夏收和秋耕，来巩固和发展农业生产合作社、变工组。
    合作化运动迅速发展的另一个原因，是原有的农业生产合作社在去冬今春的农业生产中，充分显示了它的优越性，因此，越来越多地吸引着广大农民。
    今年各省早稻一般都长得比往年好，许多地区甚至长得比去年的晚稻还好。这在过去是被认为不可能的事情。例如，北江省目前已有三万五千公顷夏稻收割完毕。从试点收割的情况来看，全省平均公顷产量可以达到二千三百到二千五百公斤，比收成最好的去年晚造还增产15％，比1958年早造则增产30％到35％。协和、安勇、府谅商等县、市的许多农业社一般早稻田每公顷都收获二千七百公斤到三千公斤。清化省今年早稻每公顷产量一般比去年增产五百至一千公斤。合作社的收成都比变工组和单干农民好。陈富合作社每公顷土地平均产量为五千公斤，比互助组高出二千公斤。各省早稻取得丰收，是由于在去冬今春生产中，互助合作运动得到发展，做到了及时蓄水，免除了旱象的威胁，并且还实现了深耕、密植、多施肥料的新的耕作方法。如河静省奇英县奇海合作社有一块二十五亩五分六的地，地质很差，过去常因收成不好而免纳农业税，今年经过社员们改良土壤，深耕密植，施足肥料，结果，连其他作物在内，每公顷折合可收获谷物三千一百公斤。
    目前，春耕前建立起来的农业生产合作社的早稻既将收割完毕。从总的情况看来，农业生产合作社的单位面积产量都比变工组和单干户高出很多；社员的收入一般也都有了增加。因此，最近许多地方的单干户都纷纷申请入社。
    由于农民迫切要求入社，预计今年6月底，许多省份将做到乡乡有社，作为下半年进一步扩大合作化运动的基础。
