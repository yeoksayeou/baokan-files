Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, June 27th: In the eastern part of Shanxi and the Taihang Mountains, where the season is later, wheat harvesting has fully begun.

This year, eastern Shanxi has a total of 2.96 million mu of wheat. Except for a few high-altitude cold mountainous areas, most communes have started harvesting. In order to achieve rapid harvesting, rapid threshing, and rapid storage, all localities have moved the autumn field processing work ahead and fully mobilized social forces to participate in the wheat harvest. In Pingyao County, more than 25,000 government cadres, students, and workers have gone to the countryside to participate in the wheat harvest. Therefore, the wheat harvesting work is orderly and achieves harvesting as soon as the wheat turns yellow. Since wheat sowing, eastern Shanxi has conscientiously implemented the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture. Therefore, this year's wheat is generally growing well. After threshing, the actual yield is generally 5% to 10% higher than the estimated yield.

In most parts of the Taihang Mountains, the wheat is growing better than in previous years. People in major wheat-producing areas such as Jincheng, Yangcheng, and Changzhi counties (cities) have fully engaged in the battle of wheat harvesting. In Jincheng County, 200,000 people are participating in the wheat harvest, harvesting nearly 100,000 mu of wheat every day.

    晋东和太行山区开镰割麦
    主要产麦区人民全力投入麦收战斗
    新华社太原27日电　季节较晚的山西东部和太行山区，全面开镰割麦。
    晋东地区今年共有小麦二百九十六万亩。现在除了少数高寒山区以外，大部分公社都已开始收割。为了作到快收、快打、快入库，各地把秋田加工工作赶前一步进行，麦收开始又充分动员社会力量参加，平遥县下乡参加麦收的机关干部、学生、工人等就有两万五千多人。所以麦收工作秩序井然，作到了随黄随收。晋东地区从小麦播种起，就认真贯彻执行了农业“八字宪法”，因此今年小麦普遍生长得好，脱粒后，实产量一般都高于估产5％到10％。
    太行山区大部地区的小麦长得比往年好。主要产麦区晋城、阳城、长治等县（市）人民，已经全力投入麦收战斗。晋城县参加麦收的有二十万人，每天收割小麦近十万亩。
