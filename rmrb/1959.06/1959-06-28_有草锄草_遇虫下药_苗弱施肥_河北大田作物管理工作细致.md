Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, June 27th. In early and mid-June, Hebei experienced successive rainfalls, resulting in rapid growth of both weeds and seedlings. At this crucial juncture, a specialized force of over three million people throughout the province is working diligently to strengthen the seedling management of crops such as corn, millet, sorghum, cotton, and sweet potatoes. As of the 21st, statistics show that over 59 million mu of field crops across the province have been weeded, accounting for 81.3% of the spring sowing area. More than 25 million mu have been weeded twice. Additionally, over 4.49 million mu have received topdressing fertilizer.

This year, the characteristics of Hebei's field crop seedling management after the rain are thorough leadership and meticulous management. People's communes in various regions have largely organized inspection teams to go deep into the fields and classify crops, applying extra fertilizer to second and third-class seedlings to ensure uniform growth. After checking and finding 310,000 mu of yellow and weak third-class seedlings, the People's Communes in Jiaohe County immediately applied topdressing fertilizer, and over 193,000 mu of third-class seedlings have now been fertilized. The Paihuai People's Commune in Shexian County inspected over 33,000 mu of cotton fields and found that some seedlings were weak due to aphids and others due to insufficient fertilizer. The commune mobilized members to carry two bags each while weeding, one containing chemical fertilizer and the other containing pesticides, applying pesticides when encountering insects and fertilizer to weak seedlings, thus simultaneously weeding, eliminating insects, and applying topdressing fertilizer. As a result, 12,000 mu of cotton fields throughout the commune have achieved the requirements of no cotton aphids, no weeds, and no third-class seedlings.

    有草锄草　遇虫下药　苗弱施肥
    河北大田作物管理工作细致
    新华社天津27日电　河北各地6月上、中旬先后连续降雨，雨后草、苗生长都很快，在这紧要关头，全省有三百多万人的专业队伍，全力加强了对玉米、谷子、高粱、棉花、甘薯等作物的苗期管理。到21日统计，全省已经锄过的大田作物有五千九百多万亩，占春播面积81.3％。已锄完二遍的有二千五百多万亩。还有四百四十九万四千多亩施了追肥。
    今年河北大田作物雨后苗期管理的特点是领导深入，管的细致。各地人民公社大都组织了检查组，深入到田、对庄稼实行分类排队，对二、三类苗偏施肥料，力求苗子整齐。交河县各地人民公社在检查出三十一万亩黄弱的三类苗以后，马上进行追肥，现在已有十九万三千多亩三类苗追了肥。涉县徘徊人民公社对三万三千多亩棉田进行了检查，发现有的因为有蚜虫，有的因为肥少，幼苗长得弱。公社就发动社员在锄苗时每人带上两个口袋，一个装化肥，一个装农药，遇虫下药，遇弱苗下肥，作到锄草、除虫、追肥同时并进。这样，全社有一万二千亩棉田已经做到了无棉蚜，无杂草，无三类苗的要求。
