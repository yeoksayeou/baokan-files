    Soliciting Broad Opinions to Solve Major Problems: Tianjin University's School Affairs Committee Strengthens Collective Leadership

    (Our reporters Zhu Zemin and Hong Minsheng report) Under the leadership of the Tianjin University Party Committee, the School Affairs Committee has played an active role in implementing the Party's educational policy and the decisions of the school's Party Committee, and in resolving major issues concerning the entire university.

    The Tianjin University School Affairs Committee was established in October last year. Its members include the president and vice-presidents, heads of the trade union, the Communist Youth League, various departments, and offices, as well as representatives of teachers and students. Under the School Affairs Committee, there are also working groups for teaching and scientific research, productive labor, and military sports. School Affairs Committee members are assigned to be responsible for studying important issues in these areas, providing information and suggestions to the School Affairs Committee. Since its establishment, the School Affairs Committee has discussed and made corresponding resolutions on major issues such as the school's annual plan, teaching plans and syllabi, participation of teachers and students in productive labor, and in-depth implementation of the Party's educational policy, which were then issued to various departments for implementation. Important decisions of the school's Party Committee are also brought to the School Affairs Committee for discussion and to solicit broad opinions.

    The establishment of the School Affairs Committee has further strengthened collective leadership, unified ideological understanding and work pace, so that the Party's educational policies and the decisions of the school's Party Committee can be better implemented. At the beginning of this year, after the school's Party Committee discussed the key points of the 1959 work plan, the School Affairs Committee convened an enlarged meeting. Based on the Party's policy intentions, the committee conducted full discussions on all aspects of the school's work throughout the year, including teaching, scientific research, productive labor, training of teachers, and strengthening the leadership of the Party and administration. Finally, it decided on the annual work plan. Subsequently, the School Affairs Committee brought the improvement of teaching, revision of teaching plans and syllabi, and the compilation of teaching materials to the School Affairs Committee for further special discussion, and made a resolution on "Several Unified Regulations on the Revision of Teaching Plans." Li Shusen, Deputy Director of the School Affairs Committee, also made a mobilization report to all teachers and students on the revision of teaching plans and the compilation of teaching materials. Because this resolution had been fully discussed in advance and everyone had a unified understanding, the various departments were clearer in their thinking when revising teaching plans and syllabi.

    After the establishment of the School Affairs Committee, it became easier to concentrate opinions from all sides in a timely manner, so that centralized leadership was built on a broad mass base. Because the members of the School Affairs Committee include heads of various departments, they have relatively rich teaching experience and maintain regular contact with the masses. Therefore, they can often concentrate relatively important issues from various departments, teaching and research offices, or teachers and students, and reflect them to the School Affairs Committee for timely study, discussion, and resolution, and implement them in practical work. For example, improving the teaching level of teachers is one of the keys to improving teaching quality. Teachers, especially young teachers, are eager to study and improve, but generally feel that they do not have enough time. After these opinions from the teachers were brought to the School Affairs Committee, the School Affairs Committee appointed a member of the School Affairs Committee, the director of the school's personnel department, and others to form a special investigation team, conducted key investigations, carefully analyzed the work time arrangements of twenty-six teachers, and made appropriate adjustments to the work of some young teachers who had excessive teaching tasks and too many concurrent positions, helping teachers to rationally arrange their work and study time.

    Due to the establishment of the School Affairs Committee, the spirit of collective leadership and division of labor and responsibility has been implemented. Therefore, the active role of the president has been further brought into play, enabling the president to be more bold in carrying out daily work and improving the efficiency of administrative work. For example, the School Affairs Committee proposed that the general purpose of the school running factories is to improve the quality of teaching. Based on the resolution of the School Affairs Committee and in combination with the specific situation of the school, the president actively studied and took the initiative to address specific questions such as which factories should be closed, which factories should be merged, how to merge them, what the scale of the merged factories should be, and how to transfer personnel. As a result, last year's one hundred plus factories were adjusted into twenty-one labor bases combining teaching, scientific research, and production. (Picture attached)

    广泛征求意见　解决重大问题
    天津大学校委会加强集体领导
    本报讯　记者朱泽民、洪敏生报道：天津大学校务委员会在学校党委会的领导下，在贯彻执行党的教育方针和学校党委的决定，解决有关全校性的重大问题中，发挥了积极作用。
    天津大学校务委员会是在去年10月份成立的，参加的成员有正副校长，工会、青年团、各系和各处的负责人，以及教师和学生的代表。在校务委员会下面还设有教学和科学研究、生产劳动、军事体育等工作组，委派校务委员分别负责研究这些方面的重要问题，为校务委员会提供情况和建议。校务委员会自从成立以来，对学校的年度计划、教学计划和教学大纲、师生参加生产劳动、深入贯彻党的教育方针等各项重大问题都作了讨论，并作出了相应的决议，下达各系贯彻执行。学校党委会的重要决定也拿到校务委员会上来讨论，广泛征求意见。
    校务委员会的成立，进一步加强了集体领导，统一了思想认识和工作步调，使党的教育方针政策和学校党委的决定能更好地贯彻执行。今年初，学校党委会在讨论了1959年工作要点后，校务委员会就召开了扩大会议，根据党的方针意图，对学校全年在教学、科学研究、生产劳动、培养师资和加强党、行政的领导等方面的工作，都进行了充分的讨论，最后决定了全年工作计划。接着，校务委员会又把改进教学、修订教学计划、教学大纲和编写教材，提到校务委员会上再作专门的讨论，作出了“关于修订教学计划的几项统一规定”的决议，并且由校务委员会副主任委员李曙森向全体师生作了修订教学计划和编写教材的动员报告。由于这个决议事先经过了充分讨论，大家思想认识一致，所以各系在修订教学计划和大纲时思想更加明确了。
    校务委员会成立以后，更便于及时集中各方面的意见，使集中领导建筑在广泛的群众基础上。由于校务委员会的成员包括各方面的负责人，他们有着较丰富的教学经验，与群众保持着经常的联系，所以能够经常把来自各系、教研室或师生中的比较重要的问题集中上来，反映到校务委员会，及时研究讨论解决办法，在实际工作中去贯彻执行。例如，提高教师的教学水平是提高教学质量的关键之一，教师特别是青年教师迫切要求进修提高，但是普遍感到时间不够用。教师中的这些意见提到校务委员会以后，校务委员会就委派了校务委员会委员、学校人事处长等人成立了专门调查小组，进行了重点调查，仔细分析了二十六位教师工作时间的安排情况，对一些教学任务负担过重、兼职过多的青年教师的工作作了适当调整，帮助教师合理地安排了工作和进修的时间。
    由于校务委员会的建立，贯彻了集体领导、分工负责的精神，因而也进一步发挥了校长的积极作用，使校长更能大胆放手地进行日常工作，提高了行政工作的效率。如校务委员会提出：学校办工厂总的目的是为了提高教学质量。校长就根据校务委员会的决议，结合学校的具体情况，积极主动研究：那些工厂应当停办，那些工厂应当合并，如何合并，合并后的工厂规模如何，人事如何调动等具体问题，将去年的一百多个工厂调整成教学、科学研究和生产三结合的二十一个劳动基地。（附图片）
