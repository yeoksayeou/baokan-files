    Thanks to Those Who Sent My Younger Brother Home

    Last summer, I was transferred from the army to work in the Great Northern Wilderness. During a home visit, I brought my younger brother from Guizhou to the Great Northern Wilderness. After living here for half a year, my brother had to go back. Should I send him back myself? From north to south is tens of thousands of miles. Not only would the time and my work not allow it, but even a round-trip fare would be a big problem for me. Could I let him go back alone? My brother is only an eight-year-old child, how could that be possible?

    In March of this year, I saw the movie "Lanlan and Dongdong," and I got the idea of asking the railway bureau to escort my brother home. But in addition to taking a train from the Great Northern Wilderness to Guizhou, I also had to take a car, passing through seven provinces. I thought the railway bureau might not be willing to take on this task. Later, I wrote to the People's Daily and explained my predicament. The newspaper immediately forwarded my letter to the Jiamusi Train Section of the Harbin Railway Bureau. Unexpectedly, in less than two weeks, the Jiamusi Train Section wrote to me, expressing their willingness to help me escort my brother home.

    On April 18th, I took my brother to the Jiamusi Train Section, where many comrades warmly received us. I bought a ticket for my brother, completed the handover procedures, and my brother, with a letter of introduction, boarded the Train 48 (Jiamusi - Shenyang) and began his long journey.

    After my brother got on the train, the conductor told me: "Comrade! We will take care of your brother's safety and well-being during the journey. Don't worry. After arriving in Shenyang, I will send him to Beijing and then hand him over to someone else. This is our duty as transportation workers..."

    The conductor's enthusiastic, conscientious, and responsible words have been echoing in my mind. For the past few days, I have felt infinite warmth in my heart.

    Sure enough, on April 28th, my family sent a telegram saying, "Brother has arrived home." I held the telegram in surprise and felt unspeakable gratitude to the heroes on the transportation front. "An eight-year-old child travels thousands of miles alone" is a miracle, but today in the new socialist China, it has become an ordinary thing.

### 感谢送弟弟回家的人们

    感谢送弟弟回家的人们
    去年夏天，我由部队转业到北大荒工作，因请假探家，回来时从贵州将弟弟带到了北大荒。在这里生活了半年，弟弟又要回去。我送他回去吧！从北到南相隔万里，不但时间、工作不允许，就是一次往返路费对我来说也是个大问题。让他自己回去么，弟弟才是一个八岁的小孩，怎么能行呢？
    今年3月份，我看了“兰兰与冬冬”的电影，因而产生了想请铁路局护送弟弟回家的希望。但北大荒到贵州途中除乘火车外，还要乘汽车，要经过七个省，我想铁路局未必愿担负这项工作。后来，我给人民日报社写信谈出了我的为难情况。报社立即把我的信转给哈尔滨铁路局佳木斯列车段。出乎意料，不到两个星期，佳木斯列车段写信给我，表示愿意帮助我护送弟弟回家。
    4月18日这天，我带着弟弟去到佳木斯列车段，许多同志热情地接待了我们。我为弟弟买了车票，办理了转交手续，弟弟带着介绍信乘上了48次列车（佳木斯——沈阳）开始了长途旅行。
    弟弟上车后，列车长告诉我：“同志！你弟弟在车上我们保管途中安全，生活照顾好，你放心吧，到沈阳后，我再送他到北京然后再转交给别人，这是我们作运输工作的义务……。”
    列车长热情、认真、负责的谈话一直在我的脑海里萦回着。几天来，我心里还感到无限的温暖。
    果然，4月28日，家里拍来电报说，“弟弟到家了”。我惊喜地捧着电报，对运输战线上的英雄们真有说不出的感激，“八岁儿童自行万里路”这是奇迹，但今天在社会主义的新中国里，却变成一件平常事情了。
