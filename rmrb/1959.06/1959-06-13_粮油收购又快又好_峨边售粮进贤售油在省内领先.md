Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu. Ebian County in Sichuan Province, located in a mountainous area, has broken the historical pattern of "late production season in mountainous areas, late harvesting, and slow storage of purchased grain." From May 21st to 27th, in just seven days, they delivered 1.5 million jin of summer grain, becoming the first in Sichuan Province to exceed the state's summer grain procurement target.

The Party committees at all levels in Ebian County attached great importance to the summer grain procurement work. When the summer grain had just appeared on the market, the Party committee and grain departments, under the principle of ensuring sufficient seeds for the next year and rations before the autumn harvest, distributed the procurement tasks to the communes and down to the management areas based on the production situation. Subsequently, they also dispatched cadres to form work groups to assist in the procurement in various communes and management areas. At the same time, they organized communes, management areas, and production teams to cooperate with each other. Where there was a shortage of labor in the low-lying areas, communes in the high-altitude areas dispatched manpower to support them.

The bumper harvest of summer grain greatly stimulated the enthusiasm of the peasant masses to sell grain. The communes put forward the slogan of "No delay for a single day, no shortage of a single jin, and strive to over fulfill the state's procurement task." A total of 18,000 people were organized, adopting the "five-fixed" method (fixed person, fixed task, fixed time, fixed quality, and fixed quantity), to harvest, thresh, dry, and deliver the grain to the warehouse in a timely manner. In order to save time, the commune members rushed to dry the grain during the day and transport the grain at night, delivering all the grain to the state-designated locations for storage. The commune members said: "Completing the state's procurement task early will support national construction early, and also concentrate our efforts on autumn harvest crop production and win a greater harvest."

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang. Under the guidance of the idea that "The state does everything possible to help us, and we sell more grain and oil to support the state," thirteen people's communes in Jinxian County, Jiangxi Province, over fulfilled the task of selling more than 321,000 jin of rapeseed oil (partially converted from rapeseed) to the state in ten days. The quality of the rapeseed entering the warehouse completely met the national standards.

Guided by the spirit of patriotism and collectivism – country before commune, others before self – the communes in Jinxian county, when accepting the state procurement tasks, expressed that the development of the communes' production has received a lot of help from the state, and now they should sell more oil to support the state. For example, the state transfers rice from other places to support the Sanli, Meizhuang, and Qili communes which are abundant in oil, cotton, and wheat. This year, the Qili commune alone received more than 556,000 jin of rice supplied by the state, meeting the needs of the people's lives. The state also issued large loans to support them in developing the production of cash crops. Due to the continuous assistance from the state, the production of these communes has developed, and the living standards of the commune members have improved. When the state started procuring rapeseed this year, many commune members enthusiastically said: "The state helps us, and we must support the state." These communes sold more of the remaining oil to the state. Some commune cadres and members also proposed that "People don't shortchange the land, and the land doesn't shortchange the stomach." Save more oil for sale now, and use the income to buy fertilizers, pesticides, and farm tools to ensure a greater harvest in autumn. Therefore, the delivery and storage of rapeseed is progressing very rapidly.

After the communes sold the rapeseed, they used the income in cash to purchase fertilizers and pesticides, and part of it was distributed to the commune members as wages. Recently, the communes in the county purchased 180,000 jin of rapeseed cake, more than 800 dan of chemical fertilizer, 2,100 dan of potassium magnesium fertilizer, 3,000 jin of cotton oil soap pesticides, and more than 5,840 pieces of agricultural machinery. The Sanli People's Commune earmarked one-third of the rapeseed price as a special fund for wage distribution; the Meizhuang People's Commune extracted 40% of the income from selling rapeseed to pay wages.

### 粮油收购又快又好  峨边售粮进贤售油在省内领先

    粮油收购又快又好
    峨边售粮进贤售油在省内领先
    据新华社成都讯　地处山区的四川省峨边县，今年打破了“山区生产季节迟，收割期晚，征购粮食入库缓慢”的历史规律，从5月21日到27日短短七天内，交售了夏粮一百五十万斤，在四川省第一个超额完成国家夏粮征购任务。
    峨边县各级党委对夏粮征购工作十分重视。当夏粮刚刚登场，党委和粮食部门就在保证留足下年种籽和秋粮收获以前的口粮的原则下，根据产量情况，把征购任务分配到公社并直到管理区。接着，还抽调干部组成工作组，到各公社、管理区协助征购；同时组织各公社、管理区、生产队互相协作，低山地区劳力不足，高山区的公社便抽调人力前去支援。
    夏粮丰收，大大激发了农民群众的售粮热情。各公社提出“一天不拖，一斤不欠，力争超额完成国家征购任务”的口号，共组织一万八千人，采取“五定”（定人、定任务、定时间、定质、定量）的办法，随收、随打、随晒、随交售入库。为了争取时间，社员们白天突击整晒，晚上突击运粮，把交售的粮食全部送到国家指定地点入库。社员们说：“早完成国家征购任务，就早支援国家建设，也能集中精力搞好秋收作物生产，夺取更大丰收。”
    据新华社南昌讯　“国家千方百计帮助我们，我们多卖粮油支援国家。”江西省进贤县十三个人民公社在这种思想指导下，在十天内，就超额完成了向国家交售菜油（部分是以菜籽折算的）三十二万一千多斤的任务。入库的油菜籽质量完全合乎国家规定标准。
    进贤县各公社发扬先国家后公社，先别人后自己的爱国主义和集体主义精神，在接受国家征购任务的时候，都表示公社生产的发展，得到了国家很多帮助，现在要多卖油料支援国家。如盛产油、棉、麦的三里、枚庄、七里等七个公社需要稻谷，国家就从外地调运稻谷支援他们。仅七里公社今年就得到国家供应五十五万六千多斤稻谷，满足了人民生活的需要。国家还发放大批贷款，支援他们发展经济作物的生产。由于国家经常不断的帮助，这些公社的生产发展了，社员生活水平提高了。当今年国家开始征购菜籽的时候，许多社员就热情地说：“国家帮助我们，我们要支援国家”。这些公社节余更多的油料卖给国家。还有的公社干部和社员提出“人不亏地皮，地不亏肚皮”，现在多节约些油料出卖，把收入的钱购买化肥、农药和农具，保证秋季更大丰收。因此菜籽的交售入库进度非常迅速。
    各公社出卖菜籽以后，把收入的现款，一部分用以购买肥料和农药，一部分作为工资发给社员。最近全县各公社购买了十八万斤菜饼、八百多担化学肥料、二千一百担钾镁肥、三千斤棉油皂农药、五千八百四十余件农业器械。三里人民公社把三分之一的菜籽价款作为发工资的专用款；枚庄人民公社从卖菜籽所得收入中，抽出40％发了工资。（附图片）
