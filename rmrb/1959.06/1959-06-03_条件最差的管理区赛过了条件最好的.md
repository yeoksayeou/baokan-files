    The Worst Conditioned Management Area Beat the Best

    Li Lin and Gu Gang are two adjacent management areas in Xinzhou Commune, Xinzhou County, Hubei. Li Lin management area is half plain and half hilly, with fertile soil, and it is an old production red banner township. The Gu Gang management area, however, is a large expanse of upland fields with thin, yellow clay soil, and its production has lagged behind Li Lin's for years. This spring, when the commune launched a competition, no management area was willing to find Gu Gang as its opponent; however, the Gu Gang management area boldly challenged the Li Lin management area, determined to change its poor rural land and remove its "backward" label. Thus, an intense competition began.

    When transplanting early rice, the Gu Gang management area started early and tried every means to accumulate fertilizer, applying an average of 350 dan of base fertilizer per mu, and implementing rational close planting throughout. During the tense rice transplanting season, cadres also led the masses to cultivate more than 300 mu of wasteland to grow miscellaneous grains during rest time. After the early rice transplanting was completed, the commune inspection team conducted its first evaluation, and the Gu Gang management area was rated 92 points, while the Li Lin management area was only rated 69 points. As a result, the red banner of the Li Lin management area was seized by the Gu Gang management area, which had always been backward in production.

    At this time, the party members and cadres of the Li Lin management area were greatly surprised. They held a meeting overnight to examine their complacency and immediately organized 77 party members from the entire management area to visit Gu Gang to learn from them before dawn. The people of the Li Lin management area were full of energy, and within seven days, they achieved "three supplements" (supplementing small seedlings with large ones, sparse areas with dense ones, and filling in the gaps), "four cleans" (cleaning out barnyard grass, weeds, duckweed, and green moss), and vigorously pursued early rice fertilization, and soon the rice seedlings began to surpass Gu Gang's.

    One day, Shen Huanqing, the general branch secretary of the Gu Gang management area, returned from a meeting in the commune and, under the moonlight, went to see the rice seedlings in Li Lin. Alas! The momentum was very strong, and they had already overtaken Gu Gang. He walked and thought: How can we keep the red banner? That night, Shen Huanqing did not return to the management area office but went to the fourth production team to discuss solutions with Xiao Zhenguo, the director of the management area. On May 18, the general branch committee of the management area organized cadres above the level of small team leader to visit Li Lin. Then, a campaign of accumulating and applying fertilizer, and rush weeding in the field management, set off a new upsurge in the Gu Gang management area.

    Currently, the rice seedlings in both management areas are growing green, tender, and strong. The red banner competition is still in full swing, and everyone wants to win the red banner in the next evaluation. (Li Yuezhong)

    条件最差的管理区赛过了条件最好的
    李林和顾岗，是湖北新洲县新洲公社相邻的两个管理区。李林管理区半为平原半为丘陵，土质肥沃，又是个老生产红旗乡。顾岗管理区却是大片的岗田，黄泥瘦土，历年生产落后于李林。今春，公社开展竞赛时，没有一个管理区愿意找顾岗做对手；而顾岗管理区却大胆地向李林管理区提出挑战，他们决心改变穷乡薄土，摘掉“落后”帽子。于是，一场激烈的竞赛开始了。
    插早稻的时候，顾岗管理区动手早，并且想尽一切办法积肥，平均每亩施足了三百五十担底肥，全部实行了合理密植。在紧张的插秧季节，干部还带领群众利用休息时间，开了三百多亩荒地种杂粮。早稻插秧结束后，公社检查团进行了第一次评比，顾岗管理区被评了九十二分，李林管理区只评了六十九分。于是李林管理区的红旗，就给一向生产落后的顾岗管理区夺去了。
    这时，李林管理区的党员和干部不觉大吃一惊，连夜召开会议，检查了自己的骄傲自满情绪，随即组织全管理区七十七个党员，起五更去顾岗参观学习。李林管理区的人鼓足了干劲，七天之内，实现了“三补”（小棵补大棵、稀补密、缺补全）、“四光”（稗光、草光、浮萍光、青苔光），猛追早稻肥，眼看这一大片秧苗超过顾岗了。
    一天，顾岗管理区总支书记沈焕卿从公社开会回来，乘着月色去看了李林的秧苗。哎呀！来势很旺，已经赶过顾岗了。他边走边想：怎样才能保住红旗？这一夜，沈焕卿没有回管理区办公室，马上去第四生产队找管理区主任萧振国商量办法。5月18日这一天，管理区总支委员会组织小队长以上干部去李林参观。接着，一个突击积肥追肥，抢薅草的田间培育管理运动，又在顾岗管理区掀起了高潮。
    目前，这两个管理区的秧苗都长得绿嫩茁壮。红旗竞赛仍在热火朝天地进行着，谁都想在下次评比中夺得红旗。　　　（李岳忠）
