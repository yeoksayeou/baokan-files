    Rational Allocation of Goods
    Wen Ying
    The phenomenon of "goods not matching needs" caused by unreasonable allocation of goods by commercial departments is a noteworthy one. For example, a recent inventory of warehouses by the supply and marketing cooperative of Xinli Village People's Commune in Hedong District, Tianjin, revealed goods unsuitable for sale in rural areas, such as woolen fabrics, fine wool socks, high-end radios, and high-grade cigarettes. Some rural supply and marketing cooperatives also have raincoats, leather suitcases, and other high-end goods in stock that have not sold for a long time.
    Are these cigarettes, radios, raincoats, suitcases, and other items that cannot be sold in rural areas and small cities so-called unsalable goods? Obviously not. These things that cannot be sold in the countryside are precisely what are welcomed in the cities. Turning fast-selling goods into slow-selling goods is a shortcoming in commercial work.
    Some people see it this way: "Goods not matching needs" happens every year, and it is an unavoidable thing in commercial work. A department store has to handle tens of thousands of commodities. People's food, clothing, shelter, and transportation all have to go through commercial departments. It is really not easy to allocate commodities appropriately. Indeed, in a country as vast and populous as ours, it is indeed not easy to achieve rational allocation and arrangement of commodities. People's living standards are constantly improving, and needs are constantly changing. It is not entirely realistic to demand that there be no shortcomings in the allocation of commodities. However, difficult and impossible to completely avoid does not mean that it is absolutely impossible to avoid reducing the phenomenon of "goods not matching needs" to a minimum. If commercial workers deeply understand the production and living needs of the masses, find out the market changes, and study and analyze the laws of people's purchasing power changes, they can make the work of purchasing, sales, transfer, and storage in line with objective reality, so that the allocation of goods is reasonable, and all kinds of goods can find suitable customers. Last year, the phenomenon of blindly purchasing goods in some areas was more serious than in previous years because some commercial workers in these places were ideologically divorced from objective reality. They took it for granted that the rural areas had been collectivized, the living standards of farmers had improved, and they would immediately buy a large number of cigarettes, and the communes would buy a large number of radios; but they did not really understand how much the purchasing power of the rural areas had improved, and what the new needs of the farmers were, so they seized a batch of goods. These comrades acted out of good intentions. However, this subjective good intention has created an artificial result of "stockpiling here, out of stock there," making it impossible for commodities to play their due role. This is the root cause of "goods not matching needs."
    To eliminate this artificial phenomenon of "stockpiling" and "out of stock," the fundamental solution is, of course, to start with market research. However, at present, in addition to the "fundamental" method, there is also a "symptomatic" method. This is: to thoroughly clean up the materials once, clean out the commodities in the warehouse, hold a material exchange exhibition, invite relevant units to visit, and mutually adjust what is available; to transport the high-end commodities cleaned up in the countryside, such as raincoats, suitcases, blankets, etc., to cities and industrial and mining areas; to transfer the commodities cleaned up in the cities that are suitable for rural needs to the countryside. This will enrich the material supply strength of urban and rural areas and make the best use of everything.

    合理摆布商品
    文英
    商业部门因为商品摆布得不合理而造成“货不对路”，这是一个值得注意的现象。例如最近天津市河东区新立村人民公社供销部清查仓库，就查出不适农村销售的呢绒、细毛袜、高级收音机、高级纸烟等商品。还有些农村供销社积压了雨衣、皮箱等高级商品，也是很久卖不出去。
    是不是这些在农村和小城市里卖不出去的香烟、收音机、雨衣、皮箱等等东西，就是所谓的滞销货呢？显然不是。这些在农村卖不掉的东西，正是城市里所欢迎的东西。把畅销货变成了滞销货，这是商业工作上的缺点造成的。
    有些人这样看：“货不对路”，年年都发生过，这是商业工作中难以避免的事情。一个百货商店要经营成千上万种商品，人们吃、用、穿、戴，样样都得经过商业部门，要把商品摆布得很恰当，实在不容易。确实，在我们这样一个幅员广大，人口众多的国家里，要做到合理地调运、摆布商品，的确很不容易。人民的生活水平不断提高，需要常常发生变化，要求在商品摆布上没有一点缺点，也不完全是实事求是的。但是，不容易，不能完全避免，并不是说就绝对不可能避免，不可能把“货不对路”的现象减少到最低限度。如果商业工作者深入了解群众的生产和生活需要，摸清市场变化的情况，研究、分析人民购买力变化的规律，就能够使进、销、调、存各个环节的工作符合客观实际，使商品摆布得合理，使各种货物都找到合适的主顾。去年有些地区盲目进货的现象比往年严重，就是因为这些地方的某些商业工作者思想脱离了客观实际，他们想当然地认为农村公社化了，农民生活水平提高了，就会马上购买大量的纸烟、公社要买大量的收音机；而没有切切实实地去了解农村的购买力究竟提高了多少，农民的新的需要究竟是什么，就这样大抓了一批商品。这些同志是出于一片好心。但这片主观主义的好心，却造成了人为的“此处积压、彼处脱销”的结果，使商品不能发挥应有的作用，这就是“货不对路”的根本原因所在。
    要消除这种人为的“积压”和“脱销”现象，根本办法当然是要从调查研究市场做起。但是，在目前，除了“治本”的办法外，也还有一个“治标”的办法。这就是：彻底清理一次物资，把仓库里的商品清理出来，举办物资交流展览会，请有关的单位来参观，互相调剂有无；把农村里清理出来的高级商品，如雨衣、皮箱、毯子等等，运往城市和工矿区；把城市里清理出来的适合于农村需要的商品调运给农村。这样就充实了城乡的物资供应力量，做到物尽其用。
