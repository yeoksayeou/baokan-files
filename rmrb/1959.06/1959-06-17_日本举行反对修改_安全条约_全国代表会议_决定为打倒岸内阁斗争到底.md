Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 16th: Representatives from all sectors of Japan held a national convention in Tokyo today to prevent the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." They unanimously passed a resolution stating their determination to fight to the end to overthrow the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet, which is pursuing a policy of war.

More than 350 representatives from joint struggle organizations against revising the "Security Treaty" from various regions, mass organizations from all walks of life, the Socialist Party, and the Communist Party participated in the meeting.

At the meeting, Akira Kazami spoke first, calling on all participants to devote their full efforts to fighting to prevent the signing of the revised "Security Treaty."

The participants exchanged experiences on launching movements to prevent the revision of the "Security Treaty" in various regions and held heated discussions on future movement policies.

The movement policy unanimously adopted at the meeting stipulates that in the future, joint struggle organizations with the participation of all democratic forces should be organized not only in prefectures but also in cities, towns, and villages.

The policy also stipulates that while launching struggles to prevent the revision of the "Security Treaty," vigorous struggles should be launched to prohibit nuclear weapons, prevent nuclear armament of Japan, strive to restore diplomatic relations between Japan and China, oppose military bases, safeguard the Constitution, demand the return of Okinawa to Japan, and abolish the recently promulgated new criminal law, and oppose "industrial rationalization," etc.

The policy stipulates that they will concentrate their efforts to ensure the victory of the third national unified action day on June 25 to prevent the revision and strive for the abolition of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," and to enable the forces united on the unified action day to continue the struggle in July and August.

The policy stipulates that propaganda activities will be strengthened to call on organizations from all walks of life to pass resolutions to prevent the revision of the "Security Treaty."

The resolution unanimously adopted at the meeting pointed out that the Japanese people are currently facing two paths: allowing the revision of the "Security Treaty" and moving towards war, or preventing the revision of the "Security Treaty," maintaining peace, and moving towards neutrality. The resolution stated that they will concentrate even greater strength to smash the conspiracy to revise the "Police Duties Execution Law" and fight to the end to overthrow the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet, which is plotting to revise the "Security Treaty" and implement war policies.

    方针还规定，在展开阻止修改
  “安全条约”斗争的同时，要展开强有力的斗争，禁止核武器，阻止核武装日本，争取恢复日中邦交，反对军事基地，维护宪法，要求把冲绳归还日本和取消最近颁布的新刑法，反对“产业合理化”等。
    方针规定，它们将集中力量使6月25日阻止修改和争取废除日美“安全条约”第三次全国统一行动日胜利举行，并且使团结在统一行动日的力量在7月和8月继续进行斗争。
