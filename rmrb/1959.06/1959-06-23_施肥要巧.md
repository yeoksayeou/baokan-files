    Skillful Fertilization
    Guan Wei
    The 5,033 mu of wheat planted by the Chengguan Commune in Lushan County, Henan Province, recently completed its second harvest, with a total output of over 2.69 million jin, an average yield of over 535 jin per mu (a portion may still be harvested during the third harvest).

    The bumper wheat harvest in Chengguan Commune proves that, in addition to deep plowing and reasonable close planting being important factors, fertilization must also be improved. That is, fertilizer should not only be applied in large quantities, but also skillfully. Here, fertilizer sources are abundant, and the masses have a relatively deep understanding of the importance of fertilization. However, there were initial differences of opinion on how much to apply and how to apply it. Some people believed that the more fertilizer applied, the better, regardless of the type. Many cadres and the masses also lacked experience in rational fertilization. Therefore, the Party Committee organized a large-scale debate among commune members and cadres, and mobilized them to offer suggestions.

    Based on the experience of other places and the opinions of commune members, the general guiding ideology for fertilization is "base fertilizer as the main, topdressing as a supplement; apply more topdressing during the year, and less topdressing outside the year." High-yield fields and experimental fields are fertilized with 80,000 jin per mu (50,000 jin for base fertilizer and 30,000 jin for topdressing), and general fields are fertilized with 25,000 jin (15,000 jin for base fertilizer and 10,000 jin for topdressing).

    In terms of fertilization methods, the experience of fertilizing based on observing the land, seedlings, weather, and timing was adopted to achieve rational, good, and skillful fertilization. Topdressing adopted the method of small, frequent meals - early application, small application, and frequent application, continuously supplying wheat with nutrients; applying more phosphorus and potassium fertilizer to soils with high nitrogen content, and more nitrogen fertilizer to soils with high phosphorus and potassium content; applying more fertilizer to heavily cropped fields, and less fertilizer to lightly cropped fields. Apply phosphorus and potassium fertilizer to vigorous wheat seedlings, and nitrogen fertilizer to yellow and thin wheat seedlings. Apply coarse fertilizer carefully, combining coarse and fine applications. In the topdressing, it was also done to ferment and smash the fertilizer to maximize its effectiveness. These methods have now proven to have yielded good results.

    施肥要巧
    关畏
    河南鲁山县城关公社种植的五千零三十三亩小麦，最近打完第二场，总产量二百六十九万多斤，平均亩产五百三十五斤多，（三场还可能收打一部分）。
    城关公社小麦丰收证明，除了深翻土地、合理密植是重要因素外，施肥也要改进。这就是，肥料不仅要施得多，而且要施得巧。这里肥源广阔，广大群众对施肥的重要性认识也较为深刻。但究竟施多少，如何施，开始有分歧意见。有的人认为不管啥肥，施的越多越好。不少干部、群众也缺乏合理施肥的经验。于是党委组织社员干部开展大辩论，发动献计献策。
    根据外地经验和社员的意见，施肥总的指导思想是“以底肥为主，追肥为辅；年内多施追肥，年外少施追肥”。丰产田、试验田每亩施肥八万斤（底肥五万斤、追肥三万斤），一般田二万五千斤（底肥一万五千斤、追肥一万斤）。
    在施肥方法上，采取了看地、看苗、看天、看时施肥的经验，做到合理施肥，施好施巧。追肥采取了少吃多餐的办法——早施、少施、勤施，不断供给小麦养分，对含氮多的土壤多施磷、钾肥，含磷、钾多的土壤多施氮肥；前茬重的多施肥，前茬轻的少施肥。麦苗旺的施磷、钾肥，麦苗黄瘦的施氮肥。粗肥细施，粗细兼施。在追肥中还做到了沤熟捣碎，发挥肥效。这些办法，现在证明都收到了良好的效果。
