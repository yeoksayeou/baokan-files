Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, July 7th: Northeast Institute of Technology's leadership cadres have been going deep into grassroots units to study methods for improving teaching quality, with good results.

Since the beginning of the semester this year, the leading cadres of the Northeast Institute of Technology, with teaching as the center, have frequently gone deep into the grassroots and among the masses to strengthen investigation and research, and use typical experiences to guide work. The Party Committee Secretary, President, and responsible cadres of various departments have, after going deep into the grassroots units, on the one hand, specifically helped solve difficulties in their work; on the other hand, they have humbly learned from the masses, summarized the experiences of the masses, and improved and promoted them.

The leading cadres went to the grassroots units of departments and majors, not only participating in teaching and research section meetings and attending classes to understand the problems in teaching and put forward suggestions for improving teaching work, but also frequently talked with teachers and students to listen to and collect opinions on teaching. They also frequently went to relevant factories and mines to conduct investigations to further study how to better combine teaching, productive labor, and scientific research. Liu Yunguang, the First Secretary of the Party Committee, conducted a week-long visit and investigation in Anshan Iron and Steel before helping the steel metallurgy department's iron and steel major formulate a teaching plan. During the investigation process, he asked ironmaking workers for advice on production knowledge and learned production experience, and also solicited the opinions of teachers and students on-site on the formulation of the teaching plan.

The leading cadres went deep into the grassroots units and among the masses, and after studying and analyzing the information they obtained, they grasped the key to improving teaching quality. The leading cadres of the Party Committee learned in the mechanical manufacturing major that after teachers and students participated in local industrial production, they were very eager to "teach well" and "learn well." However, some teachers believed that to "teach well," they had to prepare lessons behind closed doors, neglecting the combination with students; and students lacked specific arrangements in their studies, and some did not respect teachers enough. After studying with grassroots cadres, it was decided to focus on establishing a new type of teacher-student relationship, guiding the enthusiasm of teachers and students to doing a good job in teaching and realizing the teaching plan. Based on the experience provided by this major, and at the same time studying the instructions of the higher-level Party Committee, they carried out the work of teaching well, learning well, and having good teacher-student relations, with teaching as the center. A new atmosphere of hard study, love of labor, and respect for teachers gradually formed among the students. The teachers also went to the students to tutor them, solicit their opinions on teaching, and improve teaching methods, so that the quality of teaching was continuously improved.

    深入基层抓教学质量
    东北工学院领导干部加强调查研究工作
    据新华社沈阳7日电　东北工学院领导干部深入基层单位，研究提高教学质量的办法，得到很好的效果。
    今年开学以来，东北工学院的领导干部以教学为中心，经常深入基层、深入群众，加强调查研究，运用典型经验指导工作。中共党委书记、院长及各系负责干部，深入基层单位后，一方面具体帮助解决工作上的困难；一方面虚心向群众学习，总结群众的经验，加以提高和推广。
    领导干部们到系和专业的基层单位，不但参加教研室会议和听课，了解教学中的问题，提出改进教学工作的意见。还经常和师生交谈，倾听、搜集对教学的意见。他们还经常到有关的工厂、矿山作调查，进一步研究教学、生产劳动和科学研究怎样结合得更好。党委第一书记柳运光，在帮助钢冶系钢铁专业制定教学计划前，曾经到鞍钢进行了一个星期的访问调查。他在调查过程中，向炼铁工人请教生产知识和学习生产经验，还征求现场教学的师生对制定教学计划的意见。
    领导干部深入基层单位和群众，把了解到的情况经过研究分析，抓住了提高教学质量的关键。党委领导干部在机械制造专业了解到师生们在参加地方工业生产以后，要求“教好”、“学好”很迫切。但是有的教师认为要“教好”就要关起门来备课，忽视和学生结合；而学生在学习上缺乏具体安排，有的对教师也不够尊重。经过和基层干部研究以后，就决定抓住建立新型的师生关系这个中心环节，把师生的积极性引导到搞好教学，实现教学计划上去。他们根据这个专业提供的经验，同时研究了上级党委的指示，开展了以教学为中心的教好、学好、师生关系好的工作。在学生中逐渐形成刻苦学习、热爱劳动和尊重教师的新风尚。教师们也到学生中去辅导，征求学生对教学上的意见，改进教学方法，使教学质量不断地提高。
