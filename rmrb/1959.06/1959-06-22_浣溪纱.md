    Wuxi Sha
  　Tian Han
    (In memory of Mr. Liu Yazi on the first anniversary of his death, using the rhymes of Yazi and Chairman Mao)
        First
    It's again the sixth month of the yellow plum season, the famous garden and sparse willows evoke boundless thoughts, seeking this old friend in a dream is difficult to fulfill. The heroic spirit of the Southern Society perfumes the Guilin, the Dongpo's poetic brush moistens Hotan, eyebrows and hearts each are unparalleled!
        Second
    For two years, relying on a cane, facing the sea and sky, riding the wind, fortunately, feathers were still intact, now seeing the sun of enlightenment is round. Ten years of pioneering cannot catch up with the island?, a chorus of songs connects to Hotan, you should be smiling before the Treasure Mountain.

    ?When Yazi was sixty years old in Guilin, I once gave him a poem, with the lines "Rousseau fought to the death for democracy, Li Bai was content to live in a wine village, still there are eyebrows that can be charming, there is no heart to compare with Fenfang."
    ?In the winter of 1947, Yazi flew from Shanghai to Hong Kong to avoid being captured by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits. He was ill for two years. Upon receiving a telegram from Chairman Mao, he boarded the "Hua Zhong" ship on February 27, 1949, and left Hong Kong for the Northeast Liberated Area. He wrote on February 28th upon departure: Sixty-three years old, ten thousand miles journey, the future is truly joyful and towards the light. Riding the wind and waves is a lifelong ambition, sweeping across the South Sea and descending to the North Shore.
    ?Refers to the island of Great Britain.

    浣溪纱
  　田汉
    （纪念柳亚子先生逝世一周年，用亚子和毛主席韵）
        其一
    又是黄梅六月天，名园疏柳意翩?，待寻此老梦难圆。南社豪情馨八桂，东坡词笔润和阗，须眉肝胆各无前！?
        其二
    两载扶筇对海天，乘风犹幸羽毛?，光明今见太阳圆。?创业十年追不岛，?歌声一片接于阗，公应含笑宝山前。
    ?亚子在桂林六十寿时我曾赠诗，有“卢梭抵死争民主，李白甘心住酒乡，犹有须眉能娬媚，更无肝胆比芬芳”句。
    ?亚子一九四七年冬自上海飞香港，避蒋匪缯缴，抱病两年，以毛主席电召，于一九四九年二月二十七日登“华中”轮，离港赴东北解放区。二十八日登程有作云：六十三龄万里程，前途真喜向光明。乘风破浪平生意，席卷南溟下北滨。
    ?指不列颠岛。
