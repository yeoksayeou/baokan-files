Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 6th: The Kishida Nobusuke government's approximately two thousand armed police officers used violence today at the Shime Mining Station in Fukuoka Prefecture, injuring approximately one hundred workers who opposed selling this state-run coal mine to capitalists.

Starting this morning, approximately eight thousand coal miners, family members, and other union members from the Shime Mining Station of the state-run railway formed a tight human barricade around the mining station, hand in hand, to prevent the state-run railway authorities' investigation team from investigating the property value and coal reserves of this mining station, so as to sell this state-run coal mine to capitalists at a low price.

The authorities mobilized two thousand police officers to beat the workers and attempted to break through the workers' blockade line with cars. As a result, a conflict broke out between the two sides. The union announced that a total of one hundred people were injured and two were arrested. Koryanagi Isamu, a Socialist Party Diet member who supported the workers' struggle, was also injured.

However, the workers did not yield and continued to resist heroically. The police and the investigation team failed to break through the blockade line.

It was not until 4 p.m. that the police were forced to withdraw after negotiations between the union and the state-run railway authorities. Both sides decided to continue negotiations on the 7th.

The Japanese Socialist Party issued a statement on the atrocities of the Kishida Nobusuke government authorities, saying that the tragic bloodshed caused by the state-run railway authorities' forced investigation of the Shime Mining Station is absolutely impermissible. The state-run railway authorities mobilized two thousand police officers to injure union members, and all responsibility for this lies with the state-run railway authorities and the government. Socialist Party Secretary-General Asanuma Inejirō also lodged a protest with Transport Minister Shigemune Yūzō this afternoon.

The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan also issued a statement condemning the behavior of the state-run railway authorities.

Yoshida, chairman of the National Railway Workers' Union, said in a statement that the National Railway Workers' Union will resolutely investigate the responsibility of the state-run railway authorities and will fight to the end against the authorities' sale of the Shime Mining Station to capitalists.

    岸政府对日本工人施毒手
    两千名警察打伤一百名矿工
    新华社6日讯　东京消息：岸信介政府的约两千名武装警察今天在福冈县的志免矿业所施用暴力，打伤了约一百名反对把这个国营煤矿卖给资本家的工人。
    国营铁道公司志免矿业所的煤矿工人、家属和其他工会的会员共约八千人从今天早晨起在这个矿业所周围手挽手地组成了严密的封锁线，阻止国营铁道当局的调查团来调查这个矿业所的财产价值和煤藏量，以便把这个国营煤矿廉价卖给资本家。
    当局调动了两千名警察，殴打工人，并开着汽车企图冲破工人的封锁线。结果，双方发生冲突，工会方面宣布，共有一百人受伤，二人被逮捕。支援工人斗争的社会党国会议员小柳勇也被打伤。
    但是，工人们并没有屈服，继续英勇抵抗，警察和调查团一直未达到突破封锁线的目的。
    直到下午四时，经工会和国营铁道当局谈判后，警察被迫撤退。双方决定7日继续谈判。
    日本社会党就岸信介政府当局的暴行发表声明说，由于国营铁道当局强行调查志免矿业所从而引起了流血的悲惨事情，这是绝对不能容许的。国营铁道当局动员二千名警察使工会会员受伤，这一切责任都在国营铁道当局和政府方面。社会党书记长浅沼稻次郎今天下午还向运输相重宗雄三提出了抗议。
    日本工会总评议会也发表声明，谴责国营铁道当局的行为。
    国营铁道工会的委员长吉田发表谈话说，国营铁道工会要坚决追究国营铁道当局的责任，同时，要为反对当局把志免矿业所卖给资本家而斗争到底。
