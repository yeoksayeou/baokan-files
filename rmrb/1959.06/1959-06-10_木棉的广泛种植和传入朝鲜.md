In feudal society, ordinary people were called "buyi" (布衣) or "baiyi" (白衣), meaning "cloth-wearers" or "white-wearers," because commoners were only allowed to wear clothes made of cloth or white clothes. In some eras, merchants were also restricted to wearing white clothes. For example, during the Three Kingdoms period, Lü Meng ambushed Guan Yu by disguising his soldiers as merchants in white clothes, allowing them to cross the river unnoticed. Guan Yu was caught by surprise, leading to the collapse of his entire army.

Before the Ming Dynasty, "buyi" referred to clothes made of hemp. Hence, a book on physiognomy was called "Ma Yi Xiang Fa" (麻衣相法), or "Hemp-Clothed Physiognomy." After the Ming Dynasty, cotton cloth became more widely used, and "buyi" came to refer to cotton clothes.

Cotton cloth was introduced to China very early. During the Northern and Southern Dynasties, it was imported from Southeast Asia and other regions, and was called "jibei" (吉贝) or "baidie" (白叠). Cotton was also produced domestically in Gaochang (present-day Turpan, Xinjiang) in the Northwest. The cloth produced there was called "baidie." Between the Song and Yuan dynasties, many regions planted cotton, such as Fujian, Guangdong, eastern Zhejiang, eastern Jiangsu, Jiangxi, and Huguang. Among them, the most famous cotton-growing area was Qiongzhou in Guangdong. In the mid-13th century, a poet described the spinning and weaving situation in the Yangtze River basin: "The wheel turns like soft thunder, spinning snow in autumn; the bow bends like a crescent moon, carding clouds at night." At the end of the Yuan Dynasty, Huang Daopo from Wunijing, Songjiang (present-day Shanghai), brought back advanced spinning and weaving tools and techniques from the Li people of Qiongzhou and taught them to the women in her hometown. The local people's lives improved, and over a thousand families relied on spinning and weaving for their livelihood. A poet sang: "Women of Wujing are skilled in spinning and weaving, producing cotton cloth three hundred feet long." From then on, Songjiang became the center of cotton cloth production in the Ming Dynasty. After Emperor Taizu of the Ming Dynasty rose in revolt, he vigorously promoted cotton planting, requiring each peasant household to plant half a mu of cotton, and those with more land to plant double that amount. The widespread planting of cotton and the continuous improvement of textile technology led to a continuous increase in cotton cloth production, making it a common clothing material for the people.

During the same period, cotton was also introduced to Korea from China. The Annals of King Taejo Gangheon of the Joseon Dynasty of Korea contain the following record:

In 1363 (23rd year of the reign of Emperor Shun of the Yuan Dynasty), Mun Ik-jeom, a secretary in the entourage of a Goryeo envoy to the Yuan Dynasty, saw cotton plants by the roadside on his return journey. He picked more than ten cotton bolls and put them in his pocket. The following year, he returned to his hometown of Jinju and gave half of them to his fellow villager Jeong Cheon-ik to try planting. As a result, only one survived. In the autumn, he harvested more than one hundred cotton bolls. Afterwards, he continued to plant more each year. By 1367, Jeong Cheon-ik distributed cotton seeds to the farmers in the village and encouraged them to plant them. As for the cotton plants planted by Mun Ik-jeom himself, they did not produce many cotton bolls.

One day, a monk named Hongwon came to Jeong Cheon-ik's house, saw the cotton, and cried with joy, saying, "I never thought that today, I would see something from my homeland again." Jeong Cheon-ik invited him to stay and asked him about the methods of reeling and weaving. Hongwon explained in detail and even made tools for him. Jeong Cheon-ik immediately had his family weave a bolt of cloth, and the neighbors all learned the technique, teaching it to the entire village. In less than ten years, they had taught the entire country.

Mun Ik-jeom died in 1398 at the age of seventy. Because of his merit in bringing in cotton seeds, he was appointed as a scribe in 1375 and eventually rose to the position of Vice Minister of the Left. After his death, he was posthumously awarded the title of Duke of Gangseong. In 1401, the Korean Councilor Kwon Geun said to the king: "The late Counselor Mun Ik-jeom first entered Jiangnan and brought back cotton seeds, which he sent to a village house in Jinju. They began to weave cotton cloth there. Because of this, cotton originated in Jinju, and from Jinju, it spread to the whole country, so that people of all classes could wear cotton clothes. All this is due to Mun Ik-jeom's merit. Now that he is dead, he has a son still living in Jinju. He should be taken care of and employed by the government." (Annals of King Taejong Gongjeong of the Joseon Dynasty of Korea.)

From this, it can be seen that cotton was introduced to Korea by Mun Ik-jeom in 1363, trial-planted in Jinju in 1364, and promoted to the whole country around 1377. As for the spinning and weaving techniques and tools, they were taught by the monk Hongwon. This person is equivalent to Huang Daopo in Songjiang.

As for the location where the cotton bolls were obtained, Kwon Geun said it was Jiangnan, while the Annals of King Taejo said it was obtained in the Yuan Dynasty. At that time, the capital of the Yuan Dynasty was Dadu, which is now Beijing. Obtaining cotton bolls near Dadu at that time is inconsistent with historical reality. According to the situation in 1363, Zhu Yuanzhang was in Nanjing, Zhang Shicheng was in Suzhou, and Fang Guozhen was in Zhejiang. Zhang Shicheng and Fang Guozhen both received official titles from the Yuan Dynasty. In Jeong In-ji's History of Goryeo during the reign of King Gongmin, Zhu Yuanzhang, Zhang Shicheng, and Fang Guozhen all sent envoys to Goryeo many times. Cross-referencing the two books, it can be confirmed that the location where Mun Ik-jeom obtained the cotton bolls was in Jiangnan, that is, the Suzhou-Songjiang area. The "Yuan Dynasty" mentioned in the Annals of King Taejo should be Zhang Shicheng, who received an official title from the Yuan Dynasty. The two statements are not contradictory. The Goryeo History, Genealogy of King Gongmin:

In the 12th year of Gye Myo (1363 AD), on the day of Im Ja in the fourth month of summer, Zhang Shicheng sent an envoy to congratulate the pacification of the "Red Turbans," offering colorful silks, sheep, and peacocks.

It is very likely that Mun Ik-jeom was an envoy in return for this envoy sent by Zhang Shicheng.

As for the cotton mentioned in the Veritable Records of the Ming Dynasty and the Veritable Records of the Joseon Dynasty, it should actually be upland cotton. Because tree cotton was introduced earlier and upland cotton later, it was customary to call upland cotton "tree cotton." There are many examples of this in history.

### 木棉的广泛种植和传入朝鲜

    木棉的广泛种植和传入朝鲜
    刘勉之
    封建社会里的平民百姓叫布衣，或者白衣。因为平民百姓只许穿布衣服、白衣服的缘故。有的时代，商人也只能穿白色的衣服。例如三国时吕蒙袭击关羽，把兵士乔装穿白衣服为商人偷渡，关羽没有觉察，以致突然被袭，全军崩溃。
    在明代以前，布衣指的是麻布的衣服。所以有一种看相的书就叫作麻衣相法。在此以后，棉布逐渐推广了，布衣指的是棉布了。
    棉布传入中国很早，南北朝时从南洋等地输入，叫作吉贝，也叫白叠。国内西北高昌（今新疆吐鲁蕃）也产棉花，出的?布，就是白叠。宋元间已有许多地区种棉，如福建、广东、浙东、江东、江西、湖广等地，其中著名的种棉地区是广东的琼州。十三世纪中期，诗人描写长江流域纺绩情况说：“车转轻雷秋纺雪，弓弯半月夜弹云。”末期松江乌泥泾人黄道婆从琼州带回黎族人民的先进纺绩工具和技术，教会家乡妇女。当地人民生活提高，靠纺绩生活的有一千多家。诗人歌咏：“乌泾妇女攻纺绩，木棉布经三百尺。”松江从此成为明代出产棉布的中心。明太祖起事以后，就大力推广植棉，要每户农民必须种木棉半亩，田多的加倍。棉花的普遍种植和纺织技术的不断提高，使棉布产量日益增加，成为人民普遍穿用的服装原料了。
    在同一时期，木棉又从中国传到朝鲜。朝鲜李朝太祖康献大王实录有这样的记载：
    公元1363年（元顺帝至正23年）高丽使臣的书状官文益渐奉使元朝。回来的时候，看见路边有木棉，就摘了十几颗棉桃，装在口袋里。第二年回到家乡晋州，送一半给同乡郑天益试种，结果只有一颗成活，到秋天收得一百多颗棉桃。以后年年加种，到1367年天益把棉种分给乡里农民，劝他们种植。至于益渐自己种的倒都不大结棉桃了。
    有一天胡僧弘愿到天益家，看到木棉，高兴得哭了，说：“想不到今天，又看到本土的东西。”天益留他住下，请教缲织的方法，弘愿详细说明，还替作了工具。天益立刻叫家里人织成一匹，邻里都学会了，教会了一乡。不到十年工夫，又教会了一国。
    文益渐死于1398年，年七十岁。由于他带进棉种有功，1375年作了典仪注簿的官，一直做到左司议大夫。死后还追赠为江城君。1401年朝鲜参赞权近又向国王说：“故谏议大夫文益渐，初入江南，带回木棉种子，送于晋阳村舍，开始织木棉布，以此木棉是由晋阳开头的，从晋阳又传到全国，使得人民上下都能穿到棉衣，都是益渐的功劳。现在他死了，有个儿子还在晋阳，应该照顾，由政府叙用。”（朝鲜李朝太宗恭定大王实录。）
    由此可见木棉是由文益渐于1363年传入朝鲜的，1364年在晋州试种，1377年左右推广到全国。至于纺绩技术和工具则是胡僧弘愿的传授。这个人相当于松江的黄道婆。
    至于棉桃的取得地点，权近说是江南，太祖实录则说是在元朝取得的，当时元朝的首都大都，即现在的北京。从那时大都附近取得棉桃，和历史实际情况是不符合的。据1363年的局面，朱元璋在南京，张士诚在苏州，方国珍在浙江。张士诚和方国珍都受元朝官号。郑麟趾的高丽史记高丽恭愍王时，朱元璋、张士诚和方国珍都曾多次和高丽通使。两书互证，可以肯定，文益渐取得棉桃的地点是在江南，也就是苏松一带。太祖实录所说的元朝，应是受元朝的官号的张士诚，两者的说法是并不矛盾的。高丽史恭愍王世家：
    癸卯十二年（公元1363年）夏四月壬子，张士诚遣使贺平“红贼”，献彩缎及羊、孔雀。
    很可能，文益渐是这次张士诚遣使的报聘使节。
    至于明实录和李朝实录记载的木棉，事实上应该是草棉。因为木棉传入较早，草棉较后，习惯上还是把草棉叫作木棉，这种例子历史上是很多的。
