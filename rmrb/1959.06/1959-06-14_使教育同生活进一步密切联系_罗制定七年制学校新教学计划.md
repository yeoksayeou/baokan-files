Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, June 13th: The Romanian Ministry of Education and Culture has formulated the 1959-1960 academic year teaching plan for seven-year schools. The implementation of the new teaching plan will further integrate education with life. Most students in Romanian seven-year schools take up industrial and agricultural production jobs after graduation. To enable them to acquire more production knowledge, the new teaching plan stipulates that rural seven-year schools should teach agricultural knowledge, with fifth, sixth, and seventh-grade students engaging in four hours of practical training per week. Urban seven-year schools should teach industrial knowledge, with fifth, sixth, and seventh-grade students engaging in three to four hours of practical training in workshops per week. At the same time, when teaching physics, chemistry, mathematics, and other courses in seven-year schools, the connection between these courses and the industrial and agricultural production processes should be strengthened.

In order to reduce the burden on students and ensure that students learn general cultural knowledge and engage in production practice, the plan stipulates that courses on ancient and medieval history will be discontinued in seven-year schools, and the history of the country's social development will be added. The daily class time for students in each grade of the seven-year schools will also be reduced by one to two hours.

    使教育同生活进一步密切联系
  　罗制定七年制学校新教学计划
    新华社布加勒斯特13日电　罗马尼亚教育和文化部已经制订了七年制学校1959—1960年度教学计划，新的教学计划的执行，将使教育同生活进一步密切联系。罗马尼亚七年制学校的学生在毕业后多半都走上工农业生产岗位。为使他们获得更多的生产知识，新的教学计划规定，农村的七年制学校应讲授农业知识，五、六、七年级学生每周要实习四小时。城市的七年制学校应讲授工业知识，五、六、七年级学生每周在车间实习三至四小时。同时，七年制学校在讲授物理、化学、数学等课程时，应该加强这些课程同工农业生产过程的联系。
    为了减轻学生的负担，保证学生学到一般文化知识和进行生产实习，计划规定，在七年制学校中停授有关古代和中世纪的历史课程，增授本国社会发展史。七年制学校各年级学生的每天上课时间也将减少一至二小时。
