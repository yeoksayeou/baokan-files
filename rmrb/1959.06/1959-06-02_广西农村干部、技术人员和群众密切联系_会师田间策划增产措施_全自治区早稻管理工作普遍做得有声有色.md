    Nanning, June 1 (by our newspaper) In the field management of early rice, thousands upon thousands of rural cadres in Guangxi have universally established close ties with farmers and technicians. Heartwarming stories of their close collaboration and joint planning for increased production are widely circulated among the masses.
    Practice has proven that the working method of combining cadres, farmers, and technicians is a very important mass line working method. The technical measures determined through this method are also effective and relatively scientific.
    Before the start of field management, the Rong County Party Committee, based on the recommendations of cadres sent to lower levels, hired twenty experienced farmers as agricultural advisors to the Party Committee. The head of the advisory group, Xia Weisheng, is an ordinary commune member of the Songshan Commune. At regularly held forums, they spoke freely, shared their ideas, and worked with technicians to help the County Party Committee formulate a plan for early rice management, and also introduced many local pesticides and local methods for preventing and controlling pests and diseases. These experiences and methods are reliable and very popular among the masses. Recently, the Xiali Commune in Luocheng County also hired eighty-eight experienced farmers as the commune's "military advisors." In early May, these farmers and more than five hundred cadres and technicians met in the fields for the first time. They inspected, discussed, and offered suggestions, conducting a diagnosis of more than fifty mu of early rice plot by plot. Liu Mingzhou, nearly sixty years old and with forty years of farming experience, walked into a cold water paddy field, scooped up a handful of mud fertilizer, and saw that it was all pond mud and soil fertilizer. He said: "People who are cold need to drink hot soup, and cold water fields need warm fertilizer; this kind of field is best fertilized with cooked cow dung and lime." Veteran farmers Yao Keru, Wei Ziwu, and others also suggested applying different top dressings depending on the condition of the seedlings, the fertility of the soil, and the type of base fertilizer. After collective discussion, the cadres summarized these suggestions and proposed a "Five-Look Fertilization Method" (look at the seedlings, look at the field water, look at the soil quality, look at the base fertilizer, and look at the timing); after its implementation, it had an immediate effect, and the seedlings grew evenly and vigorously.
    Chen Guang, the first reporter of the Cangwu County Party Committee, who served as a field administrator in the Xindi Commune, made friends with several farmers. These friends often reminded him of the farming proverb "Good seedlings fear premature death, good rice fears lodging," which made him deeply appreciate the serious importance of preventing lodging. One friend's rice seedlings had lodged every year in one particular field, but one year, because of a drought, they did not lodge. Afterwards, he explored and implemented shallow irrigation or alternating daytime sun and nighttime irrigation, and the seedlings grew thick and strong and no longer lodged. Chen Guang affirmed his friend's personal experience and introduced this experience to various communes. More than eighty thousand mu of rice seedlings in the county that were prone to lodging were all drained and exposed to the sun, and good results were achieved.
    The better the early rice grew, the more active the field activities of cadres, farmers, and technicians became. The Yulin and Wuzhou prefectures' people's communes generally organized rice seedling appraisal teams to go deep into the fields, observe carefully, conduct multiple rice seedling rankings, and continuously eliminate third-class seedlings. Some production brigades had as many as seven or eight ways to deal with third-class seedlings, which was very meticulous. The early rice of the youth team of the Shitong Brigade of the Xingfu Commune in Luchuan County had been growing for more than fifty days. After careful management, the third-class seedlings gradually improved, and most of the seedlings were already pregnant with ears. The young men were proud and thought that a bumper harvest was a foregone conclusion. Although the team had more than 5,000 dan of fertilizer and lime in storage, they were unwilling to apply it again. Later, brigade cadres, experienced farmers, and technicians came to the field to inspect and determined that the early-maturing varieties still had more than ten days of growth, and the late-maturing varieties had another month of growth. During this period, if fertilization was continued, grain production could be increased significantly. Veteran farmer Chen Xianguang said: "According to many years of experience, in the last ten days of rice seedling growth, the yield per mu can differ by more than fifty jin between applying ear-promoting fertilizer and not applying ear-promoting fertilizer. We must not neglect late-stage management." The young men were convinced and criticized their complacency and predetermined thinking, and applied all the remaining fertilizer to the fields.
    This working method has made the work style of rural cadres more democratic, in-depth, and pragmatic than before, and has won the praise of the masses. The enthusiasm of the people of all ethnic groups has been further developed, and the field management work has been generally carried out vigorously. Now, most of the 12 million mu of early rice in the entire autonomous region is growing thicker than last year. The fields are full of rolling waves of green, and a bumper harvest is in sight.

    广西农村干部、技术人员和群众密切联系
    会师田间策划增产措施
    全自治区早稻管理工作普遍做得有声有色
    本报南宁1日电　在早稻的田间管理中，广西千千万万农村干部，普遍和农民、技术员建立了密切的联系。他们密切结合、共商增产大计的佳话，广泛地流传在群众中间。
    实践证明，干部、农民和技术人员三结合的工作方法，是一条十分重要的群众路线的工作方法。经过这种方法所决定的技术措施，也是行之有效的、比较科学的。
    早在田间管理开始以前，中共容县县委就根据下放干部的推荐，聘请了二十位有经验的农民担任党委的农事顾问。顾问团团长夏伟生是松山公社的普通社员。他们在定期举行的座谈会上，畅所欲言，齐展计谋，同技术人员一道帮助县委制定了早稻管护方案，还介绍了许多防治病虫害的土农药和土办法。这些经验和办法由于切实可靠，很受群众欢迎。罗城县下里公社最近也聘请了八十八位有经验的农民作为公社的“军师”。5月上旬，这些农民和五百多名干部、技术人员首次会师田间，他们边检查、边商量、边献计，对五十多亩早稻逐块进行了会诊。年近花甲、有四十年耕作经验的刘明周，走进一块冷水田，伸手挖起一把泥肥，定睛一看全是肥塘泥和土化肥，他说：“人冷要喝热汤，水冷要下温肥；这种田最好施放熟牛粪和石灰。”老农姚克汝、韦子物等人也提出要看禾苗好坏、土质肥瘦和基肥品种，施不同的追肥。这些建议经过集体研究，由干部归纳提出一条“五看施肥法”
  （看禾苗、看田水、看土质、看基肥、看时机）；推行以后，立竿见影，禾苗长得又均衡又旺盛。
    在新地公社当田间管理员的中共苍梧县委第一记者晨光，交结了好几位农民朋友。朋友经常向他叮咛着“好子怕夭，好禾怕倒”的农谚，使他深刻体会到防止倒伏的严重意义。一位朋友过去有一块田禾苗年年倒伏，但是有一年因为受旱却没有倒伏：以后他就摸索着实行浅灌润管或日晒夜灌的办法，禾苗就长得粗壮，不再倒伏。晨光肯定了这位朋友的亲身体会，向各公社介绍了这条经验。全县八万多亩有倒伏现象的禾苗，全部实行排水放晒后，都收到了良好的效果。
    早稻生长得越好，干部、农民和技术员们的田间活动越加活跃。玉林和梧州专区各人民公社都普遍组织了禾苗鉴定团，深入田间，仔细观察，多次进行禾苗排队，不断消灭三类禾。有些生产大队处理三类禾苗的办法多至七、八种，十分细致。陆川县幸福公社石垌大队青年队的早稻，已生长五十多天，经过精心管护，三类禾逐步升级，绝大部分禾苗已经孕穗，小伙子们得意洋洋，认为丰收已成定局。队里虽然存有五千多担肥料和石灰，也不愿再次追施。后来，大队干部、有经验的农民和技术员来到田间检查，断定早熟品种还有十多天的生长期，迟熟品种还有一个月的生长期，在这段时间内，如果继续追肥，可以增产很多粮食。老农陈显光说：“根据以往多年的经验，在禾苗生长期最后十天内，攻禾胎肥与不攻禾胎肥，亩产量相差五十多斤，切不可忽视后期管理。”小伙子们听了心服口服，批判了自满和定局思想，把全部存肥追放到田里。
    这种工作方法，使农村干部的作风比以前更加民主、深入和踏实，获得了群众的赞扬。各族人民的积极性已经进一步发扬起来，田间管理工作普遍搞得有声有色。现在，全自治区一千二百万亩早稻绝大部分比去年长得粗壮，田野上禾浪滚滚，一片碧绿，丰收有望。（附图片）
