The "Treasure Trove" of the Odd-Job Man
——The Story of Su Baoyuan's Production Increase and Savings
Jin Yuanqing

Recently, an interesting story emerged from the Shenyang Third Machine Tool Plant: despite having countless heroes and model workers, the honorary title of "Production Increase and Savings Red Banner Bearer" was awarded to Su Baoyuan, an odd-job man who sweeps the yard and mops the floors, and no one in the entire factory disputed it.

Su Baoyuan, affectionately known as "Old Su," is not tall, and he is always diligently doing the most "inconspicuous" work. With a piece of cloth tied around his waist as an apron and a burlap sack on his shoulder, he constantly circles around the factory's trash cans, dirt piles, and wall corners. Like panning for gold, he collects those discarded materials piece by piece and puts them in his self-built "scrap warehouse." Gradually, the scrap filled four or five warehouses, containing more than a hundred types of items, from metal materials and steelmaking raw materials to various tools and sundries. During the days of the Great Leap Forward, his scrap warehouse became a "treasure trove." When the factory needed something, he provided them with a batch of sacks and seven bags of cement (this cement was collected by him, handful by handful, from spilled cement powder on the ground). The scrap wood he picked up was given to the nursery to make dozens of small beds...

However, the main reason Old Su became a Red Banner Bearer was that he solved five major problems for the factory.

	Sending Charcoal in the Snow
Old Su made a great contribution to the Shenyang Third Machine Tool Plant during the production of the six major pieces of equipment. To produce power station turbines, the first step is to screen sand in the casting workshop; only after screening the sand can sand molds be made, and only with sand molds can turbine parts be cast. Coincidentally, the factory's twenty-odd sieves were either leaking or had large holes, and they needed to be replaced with new mesh before they could be used. At the production scheduling meeting, the director of the casting workshop impatiently requested a supply of twenty-odd sieve meshes. The supply section chief sighed and said, "Even if we run all over the city, it will be difficult to buy them all on the same day, and it will take at least three to five days." The comrades from various workshops and departments present were also at a loss.

At this time, Wei Lianyou, the chief of the general affairs section, suddenly remembered someone and exclaimed excitedly, "Hey, I've got it! Old Su has them!" Chief Wei rushed to Old Su's warehouse and saw that not only did he have them, but he had plenty! When Old Su heard that sieve meshes were needed, he immediately pushed a cartload and carried a bundle to the casting workshop. The casting workers were overjoyed to see so many sieve meshes. They immediately nailed the meshes onto the sieves, and the 14,000-kilowatt turbine was manufactured according to plan. To express their gratitude, the workers surrounded Old Su, beating drums and gongs, and presented him with a big announcement of good news.

	The Odd-Job Man and the New Milling Machine
During the vigorous production increase and savings campaign, many workers tried to manufacture special tools to increase production capacity, but they were worried that it would be difficult to find suitable materials. At a factory-wide conference, just as the technical innovation champions from various workshops were competing with each other, someone noticed that Old Su had also come. He stood there quietly with a pile of ironware in front of him. The clever ones had already realized that he was there to "show off his treasures" and guessed that his warehouse must have a lot of steel materials. After the meeting, four or five strong men from the Third Workshop rushed to Old Su and said straightforwardly, "Old Su, quickly open the door!" Old Su took everyone to his steel warehouse. Everyone saw that it was very good. A room full of bed frames, machine frames, axles, and chucks. They took away a cartload immediately, and the remaining steel materials were also taken by people from various workshops. During another competition, the workers in the Third Workshop publicly demonstrated a milling machine they had created. When processing parts for the ⅢC-type lathe, it could increase production efficiency by one-fold. The workers specially invited Old Su to watch this wonderful performance and said gratefully, "Old Su, this was made with your scrap materials, you helped us solve a big problem."

	Who is Knocking?
The factory built a new large workshop according to production needs. However, when the workshop was half-built, it was discovered that there was a shortage of steel bars, and people were very anxious about this. One evening, Party Secretary Zhang Zhimin was considering the problem at home when he heard someone knocking on the door. He opened the door and saw a hunchbacked old man standing in the moonlight. Upon closer inspection, he recognized Old Su. Secretary Zhang quickly welcomed Old Su into the house. After talking, he learned that the old worker was also concerned about the factory's shortage of steel bars. It turned out that Old Su had found a construction ruin buried underground for many years, containing many steel bars. He told the head of the civil engineering section about this. The head of the civil engineering section underestimated the quantity of steel bars and said nonchalantly, "At most, we can smash out half a ton of steel bars, which is not even enough to pay the wages!" So Su Baoyuan rushed to the Party Secretary's house that night. As soon as Secretary Zhang heard this, he picked up a flashlight and said:
  "Let's go, let's take a look!" When the head of the civil engineering section saw Party Secretary and Old Su passing by the window to find steel bars, he began to doubt himself, so he followed them to the site for a survey. The investigation revealed that the steel bars buried underground were not half a ton, but four or five tons. With these steel bars, the new workshop was successfully built.

	Turning Waste into Gold
Generally, most discarded materials can be refurbished and reused, but the factory workers could not think of a way to utilize the abrasive cloth used to wipe machine tools. Therefore, the Third Machine Tool Plant, a large factory that produces thousands of machine tools every year, did not know how much waste abrasive cloth it threw away. The problem of how to restore the life of waste abrasive cloth has always been a difficult one.

Once, Old Su stopped a rubber-wheeled cart carrying garbage. He announced that all waste abrasive cloth should be left for him! Old Su first took a piece of abrasive cloth and washed it with cold water. After a great deal of effort, the sand and glue were still sticky on the cloth. He also tried washing it with hot water and it was washed clean all at once. In this way, this problem began to be solved, and he washed out more than six hundred pounds of white cloth by himself. When he saw the sand that had been washed down, grain by grain, he could not bear to throw it away, and he saved it up to more than twenty sacks. Later, a comrade from a grinding wheel factory heard that Old Su wanted to sell sand. After grabbing a handful and looking at it, he exclaimed in surprise, "This thing is emery!" Later, after testing, it was proved that the sand indeed contained 20% emery. The grinding wheel factory not only bought all the sand, but also thanked him profusely and said, "Comrade Old Su, this initiative of yours is really a great benefit to increasing production and saving costs!"

	Two Generations
The factory added many young apprentices during the Great Leap Forward. They had just left their families and schools and had not yet developed good habits of building the country and running enterprises with diligence and thrift. Old Su thought that as the older generation of workers, he had a responsibility to help the Party educate the younger generation. Therefore, he enthusiastically guided the young apprentices to cherish state property at any time and in any place. One day, he saw a female apprentice in the General Affairs Section sulking and insisting on being issued a kind of beautiful office paper, saying that she wanted to print some forms. Old Su stepped forward and said as affectionately as to his own daughter, "Don't grumble, I have it." The girl followed him to the scrap warehouse and saw that it was a box of used office paper, and she said disappointedly, "Can this be used?" Old Su opened a stack of paper to the back and said, "Child, look, what kind of forms can't be printed?" The girl finally figured it out, and smiled and said, "Uncle Su, give me some more!" Old Su deliberately put on a stern face and said, "Okay, but there's one thing, I only allow you to use it, not to waste it!"

Many apprentices heard that Old Su was the factory's "founding elder" and listened to him very much, but there were also a few who didn't listen very much. He picked up seventy screw sleeves from the trash can in the Third Workshop. After tracking down the people who threw things away, he found the apprentices and held a live meeting next to the trash can. But the next day, the seventy screw sleeves were thrown out again. This time Old Su thought of a new method: he took a straw rope, strung all the screw sleeves into a string, hung them on the factory gate, and attached a big-character poster. This time the effect was very good. Now the phenomenon of throwing away processing parts, tool cards, or metal materials is rarely seen. (Zhao Zhifang Illustration) (Attached picture)

    勤杂工的“万宝库”
    ——苏宝元增产节约的故事
    金源清
    沈阳第三机床厂，最近出现了一个有趣的故事：这个大企业尽管有着数不清的英雄好汉，可是“增产节约红旗手”的光荣称号，却被一个扫院子、擦地板的勤杂工苏宝元夺去了，而且全厂没有一个不服气的。
    苏宝元，大家都叫他“老苏头”，个子不高，一天到晚总是勤手勤脚地做些最不“显眼”的工作。他拦腰扎着一方围布，肩头上扛着一条麻袋，常在工厂里的垃圾箱、脏土堆以及路边墙角一带打圈子，他像沙里淘金一样，把那些废旧材料都零零星星地收集起来，放在他自己搭起的“废品库”里。渐渐地，废品竟装满了四、五个库房，这里面的东西，从金属材料、炼钢原料到各种工具和杂品，不下一百多种。在大跃进的日子里，他的废品库变成了“万宝库”。当工厂需要的时候，他交给了工厂一批麻袋、七袋水泥（这些水泥是他把撒在地上的水泥粉末一把一把地收起来的）；他捡来的零碎木料，交给托儿所做出了数十张小床……。
    但是，使老苏头成为红旗手的主要原因，还是他给工厂解决了五个重大的难题。
            雪里送炭
    老苏头在沈阳第三机床厂生产六大设备的过程中，立下了一个汗马功劳。生产电站汽轮机，头一道工序是在铸造车间筛砂子；筛出砂子才能塑造砂型，有了砂型才能铸造汽轮机部件。恰巧，这个厂的二十多个筛子，不是漏底就是眼大，必须换上新网才能投筛。在生产调度会上，铸造车间主任急不可耐地要求供应二十几个筛网。供应科长却长吁短叹地回答说：“就是跑遍全城，当天也难买全，顶快也要三、五天。”在座的各个车间、科室的同志，也都无计可施。
    这时候，总务科长魏连有突然想起一个人来，便兴高采烈地喊道：“嘿，有了！老苏头那里有！”魏科长赶到老苏头仓库里一看，不仅有，而且多得很呢！老苏头听说要用筛网，马上就推了一车，又扛上一捆，亲自送到铸造车间。铸造工人一见到这么多的筛网，真是喜从天降，立刻七手八脚地把筛子钉好，一万四千多瓩汽轮机便按计划制造了。工人们为了表示感激，都前簇后拥，鸣锣击鼓地给老苏头送了一张大喜报。
        勤杂工和新铣床
    在轰轰烈烈的增产节约运动中，很多工人都想法制造专用工具来增加生产能力，发愁的只是很难找到合适的材料。在一次全厂性的大会上，正当各车间的技术革新健将争相比武的时候，有人发现老苏头也来了。他脚前摆着一堆铁家伙，不声不响地站在那里。聪明人早看出他是来“亮宝”的，猜到他的仓库里一定有不少钢铁材料。开过会，三车间就有四、五个大汉闯到老苏头面前爽快地说：“老苏快把门打开！”老苏头就把大家带到他的钢铁库里，大家一看，好得很，一屋子的床身、机架、轴杠、卡盘，真是应有尽有，马上就拉走了一车，剩下的钢料也都被各车间的人要去了，一个也没剩下。在另一次比武会上，三车间的工人当众表演了他们搞出来的一种铣床，在加工ⅢC型车床的零件的时候，可以把生产效率提高一倍。工人们特意请老苏头看了这场精彩表演，并且感激地说：“老苏，这就是用你的废料做成的，你帮助我们解决了一个大难题。”
            谁叫门
    工厂根据生产的需要，新建了一座大型厂房。可是，厂房盖到半截的时候，发现钢筋不足，人们都为这件事急得不得了。晚间，厂党委书记张智民正在家里考虑问题，听到有人叫门。推门一瞧，只见一个驼背老人立在月光之下，再一细看，认出是老苏头。张书记连忙把老苏头迎进屋里，一谈起来，才知道这个老工人也在为工厂缺钢筋的事操心。原来老苏头找到一处在地下埋藏多年的建筑废墟，里面有不少钢筋。他把这事告诉了土建科长。土建科长低估了钢筋的数量，漫不经心地说：“最多能砸出半吨钢筋，还不够工钱哩！”于是苏宝元连夜赶到党委书记家来。张书记一听，拿起手电筒就说：
  “走，咱们看看去！”土建科长看见党委书记和老苏头经过窗前去找钢筋，也开始怀疑起自己来了，于是就跟着到现场作了勘查，结果查明地下埋藏的钢筋不是半吨，而是四、五吨。有了这些钢筋，新厂房便顺顺当当地盖成了。
          破烂变金子
    一般废旧物资，大部分可以翻新利用，可是对擦拭机床用的砂布，这个厂的工人们却想不出利用的办法。因此，第三机床厂这个年产数千台机床的大工厂，每年不知道要扔掉多少废砂布。怎样替废砂布恢复生命的问题，一直是一个难题。
    有一回，老苏头拦住了一辆运垃圾的胶轮大车，他宣布说：往后废砂布都要给他留下！老苏头先拿一块砂布用凉水浸洗，费尽九牛二虎之力，那砂子和胶汁还是粘糊糊地粘在布上。他又试着用热水洗，一下子就洗了个干净。这样，这个难题就开始解决了，他一个人就洗出六百多斤白布。他看到那些洗下来的砂子，颗是颗、粒是粒的，也舍不得扔掉，一攒攒下二十多麻袋。后来，有个砂轮厂的同志，听说老苏头要卖砂子，抓起一把看过以后，惊喜地说：“这东西就是金刚砂呀！”后来经过化验，证明那砂子里的确含有20％的金刚砂。砂轮厂不但把这些砂子全部买了去，还千谢万谢地说：“老苏同志，你这一创举，对增产节约的好处可真不小啊！”
              两代人
    工厂在大跃进中添了不少青年徒工。他们刚走出家庭和学校，还没有养成勤俭建国、勤俭办企业的良好习惯。老苏头想，做为老一代的工人，有责任帮助党教育青年一代，因此，他热心地随时随地引导青年徒工爱惜国家财产。一天，他在总务科看到一个女徒工嗗嘟着嘴，坚持要求发给她一种漂亮的办公纸，说是要印什么表格。老苏头走上前去，像对自己的女儿一样亲切地说：“别叽咕啦，我有。”这女孩子跟到废品库里一看，原来是一箱用过的办公纸，就失望地说：“这能使吗？”老苏头就翻开一叠纸的背面说道：“孩子你看，什么样的表格印不上呢？”这个女徒工终于想通了，竟笑了起来说：“苏大爷，你再给我一点吧！”老苏头就故意板着脸说：“行，可是有一件，我只准使用，不准浪费！”
    许多徒工听说老苏头是这个厂的“开国元老”，都很听他的话，不过也有个别不大听话的。他从三车间垃圾箱里拾到七十个螺丝套，经过挨门追查，找到了扔东西的几个徒工，就在这个垃圾箱子旁边开了个现场会。可是隔了一天，那七十个螺丝套又被扔了出来。这回老苏头又想了个新办法：他拿来一根草绳，把全部螺丝套穿成一串，挂在工厂大门口上，并且附上一张大字报。这下子效果很好。现在乱扔加工件、工卡具或金属材料的现象就很少见了。（赵志方插画）（附图片）
