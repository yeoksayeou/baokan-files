Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, June 6th: More than two thousand People's Army fighters, cadres, and others who gathered in North Vietnam from the former resistance base in South Vietnam – D Zone – rallied at the Unification Club tonight to protest the mad slaughter of the people in the former D Zone by the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem group.

Many of those who participated in the rally had fought bravely with the French colonial army in D Zone in the past. Five years ago, they gathered in North Vietnam in accordance with the provisions of the Geneva Accords. Their family members, relatives, and friends who remained in D Zone are constantly being brutally persecuted by the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities.

Ho Van Dai, the former head of the People's Government of Bien Hoa Province in D Zone, said at the meeting today that Ngo Dinh Diem's army's "sweeps" of D Zone were as cruel as the French colonial army's "sweeps" in the past. They bombed, shot, set fire to, raped, and plundered unarmed peaceful residents. In the two large-scale "sweeps," hundreds of people have been killed or injured, and many have been displaced.

He said, we strongly protest the South Vietnamese authorities' bestial acts that seriously violate the Geneva Accords, and we want to denounce them to world opinion.

The heads of women's, trade union, and youth organizations from the former D Zone also spoke at the meeting, pointing out that the more brutal the Ngo Dinh Diem group is, the stronger the resistance of the South Vietnamese people will be.

Amidst impassioned slogans, the meeting passed a letter of suggestion to the International Commission for Vietnam, requesting the International Commission for Vietnam to take urgent measures to stop the South Vietnamese authorities' atrocities and to conduct an investigation in D Zone. In a letter sent to the people of South Vietnam in the former D Zone, the meeting praised their firm and unyielding fighting spirit and expressed condolences to them.

The two thousand people finally shouted with fervor: "Must sever the claws of the U.S.-Ngo Group!"

    必须斩断美吴集团的魔爪！
    越南前抗战人员抗议南越当局迫害前D战区人民
    新华社河内6日电　从南越前抗战根据地——D战区集结到北越来的人民军战士、干部等二千多人今天晚上在统一俱乐部集会，抗议美国—吴庭艳集团对前D战区人民的疯狂屠杀。
    参加集会的许多人过去曾经在D战区同法国殖民军队进行过英勇的斗争。五年前他们遵照日内瓦协议的规定集结到北越来，他们留在D战区的家属、亲人和朋友正不断地遭受到吴庭艳当局的残酷迫害。
    前D战区边和省人民政权负责人胡文大在今天的大会上说，吴庭艳的军队对D战区的“扫荡”同过去法国殖民军的“扫荡”同样残忍，他们对手无寸铁的和平居民投弹、枪杀、放火、奸淫、抢掠。在前后两次大规模“扫荡”中，已经有成百人伤亡，许多人流离失所。
    他说，我们强烈抗议南越当局这种严重违反日内瓦协议的兽行，我们要向世界舆论控诉。
    前D战区的妇女、工会、青年等团体的负责人也在大会上讲话，他们指出，吴庭艳集团愈是残暴，南越人民的反抗将愈加强烈。
    大会在激昂的口号声中通过了给越南国际委员会的建议书，要求越南国际委员会采取紧急措施制止南越当局的暴行，并到D战区去进行调查。大会在寄给前D战区的南越人民的信中，赞扬他们坚贞不屈的战斗精神，并对他们表示慰问。
    二千多人最后激昂高呼：“必须斩断美吴集团的魔爪！”
