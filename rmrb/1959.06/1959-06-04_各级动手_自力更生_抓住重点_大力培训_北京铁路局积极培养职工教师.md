Mobilize at All Levels, Rely on Self-Reliance, Grasp Key Points, Vigorously Train
Beijing Railway Bureau Actively Cultivates Employee Teachers
    (Our reporter Ren Zhiqiao reports) Under the unified leadership of the Party committee, the Beijing Railway Bureau, based on the principles of "mobilizing at all levels, relying on self-reliance, grasping key points, and vigorously training," has taken active measures to initially establish a teaching staff for employee education.
    Since the Party put forward the call for technical revolution and cultural revolution, the enthusiasm of the bureau's employees for learning has soared, with the number of participants increasing from more than 40,000 to 84,500, and the enrollment rate rising from about 40% to 78% of the total number of employees.
    With the great development of employee education, the problem of insufficient teachers urgently needs to be solved. When addressing this issue, the affiliated units of the Beijing Railway Bureau mainly rely on tapping potential within their own departments to actively expand the teaching staff. In addition to equipping necessary full-time teachers, the Beijing office has sought out many part-time teachers from ten areas, including qualified workers, cadres, technicians, employee family members, and cadres assigned to the area. So far, the Beijing Railway Bureau has 248 full-time teachers and 3,159 part-time teachers, which has initially solved the current difficulty of insufficient teachers.
    After the teaching staff for employee education was resolved through these methods, new problems were encountered in the teaching process: most of the teachers have a relatively low level of education and lack teaching experience. According to statistics, there are 2,170 part-time teachers in the Beijing Railway Bureau with a higher elementary school or less than junior high school education level, accounting for more than 68% of the total number of part-time teachers. This cannot meet the learning requirements of the employees. More than 44,000 employees who have basically overcome illiteracy and are studying at the higher elementary school level are about to enter the junior high school learning stage in batches, which requires a sufficient number of teachers with a corresponding cultural level to teach them. Therefore, training and improving the teachers of employee education is an urgent task at present.
    In order to effectively solve this problem, the Party Committee of the Beijing Railway Bureau has made long-term plans and taken measures to develop normal schools, teacher training classes, and spare-time normal schools, expand the teaching staff, and improve the political, cultural, and teaching level of teachers. At the same time, in accordance with the situation that employee education is about to enter the stage of universal junior high school, it actively organizes teachers for advanced studies, observation of teaching, and summarizing and exchanging experiences. And it first grasps the key link of training junior high school teachers to meet the current teaching requirements. The four regional offices and two engineering offices under the bureau in Beijing, Tianjin, Zhangjiakou, and Shijiazhuang have all established spare-time normal colleges or full-time teacher training classes. The spare-time normal college in Shijiazhuang has trained 100 junior high school language and mathematics teachers. The Beijing office has been running spare-time normal classes since December last year, and two classes in junior high school mathematics, etc., have completed their studies, and the language class is still continuing to train. The Beijing Engineering Office has opened a normal class in its engineering school, with a half-year term, specializing in training middle school teachers. The Tianjin Engineering Office has held two teacher training classes this year, training more than 80 teachers who can teach junior high school language and mathematics courses. This kind of training class will continue to be held. In addition to having already transferred more than a dozen employees to study at Beijing Workers' and Peasants' Normal College, the Beijing Railway Administration plans to set up a employee education teacher training class in its normal college this year, transferring 80 to 120 higher elementary school teachers or employees with a junior high school education level to participate in the study and train junior high school teachers.
    The cultural level of teachers who have undergone specialized training has improved rapidly, and some have already taken on teaching in junior high school classes. Zhang Jinshan, a line worker and part-time teacher of the Second Engineering Team of the Tianjin Engineering Office, was an illiterate in the early days of liberation. Later, he improved to a cultural level above higher elementary school and served as a higher elementary school teacher. After studying in the teacher training class, he has begun to give lectures in the junior high school class. Zhao Jiazhong, a part-time teacher at the Beijing Vehicle Depot, originally had a junior high school dropout level and had been teaching arithmetic in the higher elementary school class. After training, he can now teach algebra in the junior high school class. Chen Fengyun, a teacher from Tanggu Station who came from a worker background, originally only graduated from higher elementary school. After serving as a full-time teacher, she found it difficult to teach higher elementary school language. After her own hard study and training in the junior high school language class, she has now independently taken charge of the first-year junior high school language teaching and is also teaching language courses in the second-year junior high school class. The employees who listen to her lectures reflect that "Teacher Chen's lectures are both popular and vivid."
    While paying attention to giving play to the role of part-time teachers and their expertise in production and familiarity with workers, the Beijing Railway Bureau gives full play to the backbone role of full-time teachers in employee education, using them to conduct demonstration teaching, organize part-time teachers to study lesson plans, teaching methods, and teaching content, hold teaching experience exchange meetings, observe each other, and improve together.

    各级动手  自力更生  抓住重点  大力培训
    北京铁路局积极培养职工教师
    本报讯　记者任志樵报道：北京铁路局在党委统一领导下，根据“各级动手、自力更生、抓住重点、大力培训”的原则，采取积极措施，初步建立起一支职工教育的教师队伍。
    自从党提出技术革命和文化革命的号召以来，这个局的职工学习热情空前高涨，参加学习的从四万多人增加到八万四千五百多人，入学率从占职工总数的40％左右增长到78％。
    随着职工教育的大发展，师资不足的问题就迫切需要解决。北京铁路局的所属单位在解决这个问题的时候，主要依靠本部门挖潜力的办法，积极扩大教师队伍。北京办事处除了配备必要的专职教师外，从有条件的工人、干部、技术人员、职工家属、下放在本地区的干部等十个方面物色了不少兼职教师。到目前为止，北京铁路局已经有专职教师二百四十八人，兼职教师三千一百五十九人，初步解决了当前教师不足的困难。
    职工教育的教师经过这些办法解决以后，在教学过程中，又遇到了新的问题：教师中多数文化水平比较低，没有教学经验。据统计，北京铁路局高小和不足初中文化程度的兼职教师就有两千一百七十人，占兼职教师总数的68％以上。这样，就不能满足职工们的学习要求。这个局已经基本上摆脱文盲状态、正在高小学习的四万四千多个职工，即将成批地进入初中学习阶段，这就需要有足够的相当文化水平的教师来教他们。因此，培养和提高职工教育的教师已是当前一项刻不容缓的任务。
    为了切实地解决这个问题，北京铁路局党委，作出长远规划，采取措施，发展师范学校、师资训练班和业余师范学校，扩大教师队伍，提高教师的政治、文化水平和教学水平。同时，根据职工教育即将进入普及初中阶段的形势，积极组织教师进修、观摩教学、总结和交流经验。并首先抓住培训初中教师这个重点环节，以适应当前教学的要求。这个局所属的北京、天津、张家口、石家庄四个地区办事处和两个工程处都办了业余师范学院或脱产的师资训练班。石家庄办事处的业余师范学院已经训练出初中语文、数学教师一百人。北京办事处自去年12月开办业余师范班，已有初中数学等两个班学习结业，语文班仍在继续训练。北京工程处在本处的工程学校中开设了一个师范班，半年一期，专门训练中学教师。天津工程处今年已办了两期师资训练班，训练了八十多名能够担任初中语文、数学课的教师。这种训练班还在办下去。北京铁路管理局除了已经抽调十几个职工准备到北京工农师范学院学习外，计划今年在本局的师范学院新设一个职工教育师资班，抽调八十到一百二十名有初中文化程度的高小教师或职工参加学习，培养初中教师。
    经过专门训练的教师的文化水平提高得很快，有的已经在初中班担任教学。天津工程处第二工程队线路工人、兼职教员张金山，解放初期是个文盲，后来提高到高小以上的文化水平，并且担任了高小教师。这次经过师资训练班的学习，他已经开始在初中班讲课。北京车辆段兼职教员赵家忠原有初中肄业的程度，一直在高小班教算术，经过训练，现在能教初中班代数了。工人出身的塘沽车站教师陈凤云，原来只有高小毕业的程度，担任专职教员后教高小语文，很吃力，经过自己的刻苦进修和初中语文班的训练，现在已经独立负责初中一年级的语文教学，并且还在初中二年级代讲语文课，听他讲课的职工们反映说：“陈师傅教的课又通俗，又生动。”
    北京铁路局在注意发挥兼职教师的作用和他们熟悉生产、熟悉工人专长的同时，充分发挥专职教师在职工教育中的骨干作用，通过他们进行示范教学，组织兼职教师研究教案、教法和教学内容，举行教学经验交流会，互相观摩，共同提高。（附图片）
