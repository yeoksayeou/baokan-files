Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 14th - U.S. reactionary groups and bourgeois newspapers, feeling extremely annoyed because Cuba's land reform will affect their interests, are clamoring for armed intervention in Cuba.

Former U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Braden recently stated in a speech to the Pan American Businessmen's Council in Chicago that "the only hope for Cuba to get rid of the comprehensive infiltration of communism is for the people to stage an armed uprising and carry out another revolution to drive out Fidel Castro." He emphasized that "if no action is taken, a communist country will soon appear on our doorstep. The only remedy is to use force."

The president of United Press International, McCarthy, in an article he wrote against Cuba, blatantly clamored that counter-revolutionary groups have been organized in Cuba and in the United States, "their purpose is to overthrow the current Cuban regime by force." Prior to this, U.S. Senators Allen Ellender and Wayne Hays also frantically attacked Cuba's land reform.

After the U.S. government sent a note to the Cuban government on the 11th expressing "serious concern" about the land reform law, the "New York Times" published an editorial advocating the modification of certain details of the Cuban land reform law. The newspaper threatened that in order for Cuba's land reform to succeed, "it must be in line with American interests." The newspaper also "advised" the Cuban government "not to underestimate American opinions."

    美国反动派对古巴土改暴跳如雷
    大叫武装干涉古巴
    新华社哈瓦那14日电　美国反动集团和资产阶级报纸由于古巴的土地改革将影响他们的利益而感到十分恼怒，正在大叫大嚷要对古巴进行武装干涉。
    美国前任助理国务卿布莱敦最近在芝加哥对泛美企业主理事会发表的演讲中说，“古巴要想摆脱共产主义的全面渗入，唯一的希望就是人民举行武装起义，并进行另一次革命把菲德尔·卡斯特罗赶走”。他强调指出，“如果不采取某些行动的话，在我们家门口很快就会出现一个共产主义国家。唯一的补救办法就是采用武力。”
    合众国际社社长麦卡锡在他写的一篇反对古巴的文章中露骨地叫嚣说，在古巴和在美国已经组织了反革命集团，“它们的目的是用武力推翻古巴现政权”。在这以前美国参议员艾伦·埃伦德和魏恩·海斯也曾经疯狂地攻击古巴的土地改革。
    美国政府11日照会古巴政府对土地改革法表示“严重关切”以后，“纽约时报”发表社论主张修改古巴土地改革法的某些细节。这家报纸威胁说，要想使古巴的土地改革成功，“那就必须使它符合美国人的利益”。报纸并且“劝告”古巴政府“不要轻视美国的意见”。
