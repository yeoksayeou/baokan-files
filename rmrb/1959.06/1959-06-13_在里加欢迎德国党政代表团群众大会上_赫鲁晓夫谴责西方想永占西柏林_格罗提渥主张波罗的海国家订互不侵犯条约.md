Xinhua News Agency, Riga, June 12th—According to TASS, a mass rally of ten thousand people was held on the afternoon of June 11th in the Culture and Recreation Park of Riga, the capital of the Latvian Republic, to welcome the Party and Government Delegation of the German Democratic Republic. Soviet Premier Khrushchev spoke at the rally, referring to the new proposals made by Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko on June 10th at the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference on the West Berlin issue and the conclusion of a German peace treaty. Khrushchev said that the Soviet government put forward this proposal to promote negotiations in Geneva. We believe that these proposals should be of interest to our negotiating counterparts.

Khrushchev expressed regret that Western countries said they could not accept the Soviet proposals. He said that Western countries insist on maintaining the occupation regime in West Berlin. He said that it is clear that the United States and other Western countries want to continue to pursue a "position of strength" policy.

Khrushchev called West German Chancellor Adenauer an unwise current advocate of the "position of strength" policy. He said that Adenauer is desperately trying to maintain his position as Chancellor, and he does not even want to hide the fact that in this position he intends to continue to advocate the "Cold War."

Khrushchev pointed out that the main thing is not what position Adenauer will occupy, but who he relies on. Adenauer relies on those who, like him, are still clinging to the bankrupt "position of strength" policy. No matter how these gentlemen struggle, they cannot revive the bankrupt "position of strength" policy, nor can they boost the morale of those who are keen to pursue this policy.

Khrushchev pointed out that the Soviet government is striving to consolidate peace in the Baltic Sea region. He said that we support all sensible proposals put forward by other countries aimed at consolidating peace in this region. The Soviet Union supports the proposal to establish a rocket-free, nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Scandinavian Peninsula and the Baltic Sea region. If the Scandinavian region becomes a nuclear-weapon-free zone, a zone without foreign military bases, it will be of great benefit to the people of all Scandinavian countries.

Khrushchev concluded by saying that we will spare no effort in the noble struggle to safeguard peace and the security of all peoples.

Before Khrushchev spoke, Prime Minister Grotewohl of the German Democratic Republic spoke at the rally.

Grotewohl said that fourteen years after the defeat of fascism, and when the state of workers and peasants has been established in Germany for nearly ten years, it can be said with certainty that imperialism and militarism have been completely eliminated on the territory of the German Democratic Republic. The restoration of imperialism and militarism has become impossible, because the working people have firmly grasped state power and are advancing along the road of completing socialist construction.

Grotewohl said that as the westernmost country in the socialist camp, the German Democratic Republic understands the great responsibility it bears in further consolidating the socialist camp and ensuring peace in Europe.

Grotewohl said that the main goal of the national aspirations of the people of the German Democratic Republic is to fight for the conclusion of a German peace treaty. He emphasized that West Germany is the closest ally of American imperialism, and it has become a new center of war danger in Europe. Therefore, the conclusion of a German peace treaty is particularly necessary.

Grotewohl also pointed out that the nuclear armament of West Germany would cause the balance of world military forces to change to the detriment of imperialism. He pointed out that today's Germany is no longer the Germany of 1939 or 1941. The working class, youth, and broad intellectual strata of West Germany are increasingly aware of the danger of nuclear armament and are becoming more and more actively involved. German imperialism no longer has as much manpower and territory as it had in 1939.

Grotewohl emphasized that at present, the fundamental issue of ensuring peace and restoring Germany to a unified, peaceful, and democratic state is to exclude, restrain, and eliminate militarism in West Germany.

Grotewohl said that just like a mutual non-aggression treaty between the two Germanys, the conclusion of a mutual non-aggression treaty between the Baltic Sea countries is an important step in easing international tensions and ensuring peace.

Grotewohl said that contrary to the atomic arms race of West German militarists, the German Democratic Republic is engaged in a peaceful competition to solve its main economic task, namely to strive to surpass West Germany in the consumption of the most important commodities per capita before 1961.

Grotewohl said, however, that we must also arm ourselves in order to give any aggression and any attempt to disrupt our peaceful labor the due rebuff. He pointed out that the basis of this conviction is the creative power of the German people, and the fraternal unity that connects the German Democratic Republic with the Soviet Union and all socialist countries.

    在里加欢迎德国党政代表团群众大会上
    赫鲁晓夫谴责西方想永占西柏林
    格罗提渥主张波罗的海国家订互不侵犯条约
    新华社12日讯　据塔斯社里加讯：11日下午，在拉脱维亚共和国首都里加的文化休息公园举行了万人大会，欢迎德意志民主共和国党政代表团。苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫在大会上讲话，谈到了苏联外交部长葛罗米柯10日在日内瓦外长会议上就西柏林问题和缔结对德和约问题提出的新建议。赫鲁晓夫说，苏联政府提出这个建议，是为了促进日内瓦的谈判。我们认为，这些建议应该使我们的谈判对方感到兴趣。
    赫鲁晓夫对西方国家说不能接受苏联的建议这一点表示遗憾。他说，西方国家坚持保持西柏林占领制度。他说，显然，美国和其他西方国家想继续奉行“实力地位”政策。
    赫鲁晓夫称西德总理阿登纳是不明智的“实力地位”政策的当前鼓吹者。他说，阿登纳拼命保持总理的位置，他甚至不想掩饰：他在这个位置上打算继续鼓吹“冷战”。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，主要的并不在于阿登纳将占有什么职位，而是在于他依仗于谁。阿登纳依靠的是同他一起仍然抓住破产了的“实力地位”政策不放的人。不论这些先生们怎么挣扎，他们都不可能再鼓起这个破产了的“实力地位”政策的元气，也不可能鼓起那些热衷于奉行这种政策的人的精神。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，苏联政府竭力巩固波罗的海地区的和平。他说，我们支持其他国家提出的、旨在巩固这一地区和平的一切明智建议。苏联支持在斯堪的纳维亚半岛和波罗的海地区建立无火箭、无原子武器地区的主张。如果斯堪的纳维亚地区成为无原子武器地区、成为没有外国军事基地的地区，这对一切斯堪的纳维亚国家的人民将有很大好处。
    赫鲁晓夫最后说，我们将不吝惜力量来进行维护和平和各国人民安全的崇高斗争。
    在赫鲁晓夫讲话以前，德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥在大会上讲了话。
    格罗提渥说，在粉碎法西斯十四年后的今天，当工农国家在德国建立已将近十年的时候，可以肯定，在德意志民主共和国领土上已彻底消除了帝国主义和军国主义。帝国主义和军国主义的复辟已经成为不可能，因为，劳动人民紧紧地掌握了国家政权，并沿着完成社会主义建设的道路前进。
    格罗提渥说，作为社会主义阵营最西边的一个国家，德意志民主共和国了解它在进一步巩固社会主义阵营和保障欧洲和平方面所担负的重大责任。
    格罗提渥说，德意志民主共和国人民的民族愿望主要目标是为缔结对德和约而斗争。他强调指出，西德是同美帝国主义关系最密切的盟国，它已成为欧洲新的战争危险的中心，因此，缔结对德和约就显得特别需要。
    格罗提渥还指出，原子武装西德将使世界军事力量的对比发生不利于帝国主义的变化。他指出，今天的德国已经不是1939年或1941年的德国了。西德的工人阶级、青年和广大知识分子阶层日益清楚地认识到原子武装的危险性，并愈来愈积极地行动起来了。德国帝国主义再也没有他们1939年那时所拥有的那样多的人力和领土了。
    格罗提渥强调指出，目前，保障和平和使德国恢复成为一个统一的、和平的民主国家的根本问题是排斥、约束和清除西德的军国主义。
    格罗提渥说，正像两个德国间的互不侵犯条约一样，缔结波罗的海沿岸国家间的互不侵犯条约是缓和国际紧张局势和保障和平的一个重要步骤。
    格罗提渥说，同西德军国主义分子的原子军备竞赛相反，德意志民主共和国在进行和平竞赛，来解决本国主要的经济任务，即争取在1961年以前在按人口计算的最重要的商品的消费量方面超过西德。
    格罗提渥说，但是，我们也要武装自己，以便给任何侵略和破坏我们和平劳动的任何企图以应有的回击。他指出，这一信念的基础是德国人民的创造力量，是把德意志民主共和国和苏联以及一切社会主义国家联系在一起的兄弟般的团结。
