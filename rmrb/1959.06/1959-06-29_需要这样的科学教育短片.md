We Need Scientific Education Short Films

    In a train carriage, an engineer hurriedly leaves, forgetting to unplug the electric iron. Fortunately, other passengers in the carriage help him come up with a good idea, and a fire is narrowly averted. This is a scene from the Soviet science education short film "An Incident on a Street." Another science education short film, "A Small Story," tells the story of Sergei and Maria, a couple who win 25,000 rubles. Overjoyed, the couple use their entire monthly salary to buy luxurious goods and clothing at a store... When they return home satisfied, their house has burned to the ground, and the lottery ticket has been reduced to ashes; it turns out that Maria, due to excessive joy, forgot to turn off the electric stove when she left, resulting in a joy turning into sorrow.

    These are two particularly humorous Soviet science education short films that, through small stories, strongly satirize people who do not pay attention to fire prevention, achieving the purpose of educating everyone to pay attention to electrical safety and promoting fire prevention, causing people to think deeply and remember them, while each film only lasts about ten minutes. I believe that there are not many interesting science education films like this in our country today, and they are worth learning from well.

    需要这样的科学教育短片
    车厢里某工程师慌忙地出门，竟忘了拔下电熨斗的插销，幸亏车厢里的其他旅客帮助他想出好主意，一场火灾算幸免了。这是苏联科教短片“在一条大街上发生的事”的情节。另一部科教短片“小故事”，说的是谢尔盖和玛莉雅这对夫妇中了二万五千元的奖。欢喜之下，夫妇俩拿全部月薪到商店去购买了华丽的用品和服装……。当他们满意地回来时，家里却烧了个一干二净，奖券也烧成了灰烬；原来是玛莉雅由于过度的高兴，出门时忘了关电炉子，弄得乐极生悲。
    这是两部别有风趣的苏联科教短片，它通过小故事，着力地讽刺了不注意防火的人，达到了教育大家注意用电安全，宣传防火的目的，叫人深思牢记，而每部片子仅映十分钟左右。像这种有趣的科教片，我以为今天在我们国家还不很多，值得我们很好地学习。　　　王允人
