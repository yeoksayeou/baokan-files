Xinhua News Agency, 4th Dispatch from Washington: U.S. President Eisenhower, at a press conference held on the 3rd, once again put forward preconditions for holding an East-West summit meeting. He said, "So far, the (foreign ministers') meeting has not made any progress which, in my opinion, would be grounds for holding a summit meeting."

He indicated that he had not expected the foreign ministers' meeting to achieve any significant results. He said, "It is unrealistic to think that the foreign ministers can reach some agreements that will be of great importance to the world and will greatly promote world peace in themselves. After all, the foreign ministers are working on behalf of others, and are working for the representatives of their governments, and these issues need to be taken back for careful study."

But he also said that at least one should expect "reduced differences" and identify issues and scopes worthy of discussion at future meetings. He then put forward the conditions for "progress" that he had in mind for the foreign ministers' meeting. He said that the foreign ministers' meeting should at least have a "proper working document," and "there should be some agreement providing clear guarantees, before Germany can be reunified in the future, to defend our rights and privileges, or to ensure that we will not be obstructed in the exercise of our rights and privileges in West Berlin, etc."

He said: "Of course, there are other ways to make progress in terms of contact, exchange of personnel, exchange of ideas, books, and news commentaries, etc., and there can be a freer, you might say—some gaps in getting in and out of the Iron Curtain."

Eisenhower once again repeated the U.S. official argument that the holding of East-West talks was "the result of a crisis." He said, "This crisis was caused by the unilateral action taken by the Soviet Union on the Berlin issue," and this crisis "is being used by some people to demand a summit meeting."

A reporter asked him: If the Geneva Foreign Ministers' (Meeting) made satisfactory progress, what would you think of the idea of holding a series of summit meetings so that world leaders could get together to try to ease world tensions? Eisenhower did not seem so enthusiastic about this point. He said: "I have no objection to that, because it all depends on the results and the hope of obtaining further results." He said that he was not opposed to doing so, but there must be "progress and improvement."

    阻挠举行东西方最高级会议
    艾森豪威尔坚持先决条件
    新华社4日讯  华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔在3日举行的记者招待会上再一次对举行东西方最高级会议提出先决条件。他说，“到现在为止，（外长会议）还没有取得任何在我看来可以成为举行最高级会议的理由的进展。”
    他表示他本来就不打算外长会议会取得什么重大结果。他说，“如果认为外长们能够达成一些会对全世界具有重要意义而且本身能够大大促进世界上的和平局面的协议，是不现实的。因为，外长们毕竟是代表别人进行工作的，是为他们的政府的代表进行工作的，这些问题需要拿回去仔细加以研究。”
    但是他又说，至少应该期望“减少分歧”，并且确定值得在今后会议上讨论的问题和范围。他于是提出了他心目中的外长会议必须取得的“进展的”条件。他说，外长会议至少要有一个“适当的工作文件”，“应当达成某种协议，规定在将来德国能够重新统一以前，作出明确的保证，保卫我们的权利和特权，或者说确保我们在行使我们对西柏林的权利和特权时将不受阻碍，等等。”
    他说：“当然还有其他的方法可以在进行接触、互派人员、交换意见、书籍和新闻评论等等方面取得进展，可以有一种比较自由的，你也许可以说——进出铁幕的某些空隙。”
    艾森豪威尔再一次重复美国官方的这样一种论调，说东西方会谈的举行是“一次危机的结果”。他说，“这次危机是由于苏联在柏林问题上采取单方面的行动造成的”，这次危机“正在被某些人利用来要求举行最高级会议”。
    有记者问他：如果日内瓦的外长级（会议）取得了令人满意的进展的话，你对举行一系列最高级会议以便世界领袖们可以聚在一起设法缓和世界紧张局势这种想法的看法如何？艾森豪威尔对这一点表现出并不那么热心，他说：“我对这一点没有意见，因为这完全要随结果和获得进一步的结果的希望而定。”他说，我不反对这样作，但是必须要有“进展和改进”。
