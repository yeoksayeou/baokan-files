    Thoughts on Reading "Ghost Stories"
    Zhang Pei

    It's indeed worthwhile to read ghost stories, because there are some principles of life in them worth pondering. However, I think one should read ghost stories with the right approach, otherwise one might get "possessed by ghosts."

    I remember when I was a child, I also enjoyed reading ghost stories and found "Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio" quite interesting and enjoyable to read. I found "What the Master Would Not Discuss" not very interesting, except for the horror. In "Notes from the Cottage of Close Observations," it was easy to see that Ji Xiaolan was clearly using ghosts to scold people and promote "principles." At that time, I had not learned Marxism-Leninism and did not understand whether the principles were good or bad, and I thought there were quite a few "profound truths" in them. When I wrote this view in my diary, which was a school assignment, I infected my homeroom teacher, and even he held a copy. It can be seen that ghost stories do have some appeal.

    Later, when I got older and came into contact with Marxism-Leninism theory, I still loved to browse through ghost stories. Because I could distinguish between the fragrant and the foul in the principles, I could see the clues when reading ghost stories. It turned out that although ghost stories talk about the principles of life, the principles of life are also of various kinds.

    The reason why Pu Songling's "Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio" is enjoyable to read is that in it, the fox spirits and ghosts mostly have a "chivalrous spirit," and those who get good results are poor scholars and small people. As for those "above one person, below ten thousand" high officials, they are mostly objects of condemnation and ridicule in the author's writing. "Continuing the Yellow Millet Dream," "Huang Jiulang," "Heavenly Palace," and a pile of similar stories all have this flavor. Later, after reading history, I realized that Pu Songling intended to reflect some social injustices in the late Ming and early Qing dynasties. His creation inherited the ideological tradition of the late Ming dynasty's urban literature and the more enlightened gentry's vernacular short stories. Although Pu Songling also promoted a lot of fallacies about cause and effect and reincarnation, the impact on me, who was born in the twentieth century of scientific prosperity, was negligible.

    Ji Xiaolan's "Notes from the Cottage of Close Observations" has ample literary talent, and sometimes there are some pure and beautiful little stories, but the general thought is quite reactionary. The ghosts written by Ji Xiaolan mock small people such as poor scholars and servants, or intellectuals who insist on "no ghosts." In the book, loyalty and filial piety are shown, seemingly a respectable "gentleman." Ji Xiaolan was the favored minister of Emperor Qianlong and a big figure in compiling the Complete Library of the Four Treasuries, bearing the important task of "ideological control." It would be strange if he did not promote feudal morality and "the great righteousness between sovereign and subjects." For us young revolutionaries at the time, the most profound impression was that he actually scolded Lü Liuliang, saying that he did not die when the Ming dynasty fell, but left his life to write "anti-poems," calling it "loss of direction in advance and retreat," implying that cruel means of suppression such as extermination of the clan and dismemberment of corpses were all deserved. This impression, even now, still leaves me with lingering anger.

    Although Yuan Zicai claimed to be "noble and aloof," he was actually a "cloud crane flying freely, going back and forth to the Prime Minister's office"—a "guest" figure. Besides being strange, terrifying, and obscene, his ghost stories are quite dull to read, and their nature is like the horror novels prevalent in capitalist America today.

    From this, it can be seen that while both talk about foxes and ghosts, the positions, viewpoints, and methods hidden behind the foxes and ghosts are different. If you read ghost stories without using the method of class analysis, it is difficult to avoid being "possessed by ghosts." By extension, the same is true when reading books by people. Imperialists and reactionary scholars of the bourgeoisie, although they look like humans, are actually speaking ghost talk. If you are not careful, you may be in danger of being bewitched.

    Books should be read actively, and should be read with the eyes of Marxism-Leninism. If we can do this, we will be able to see and experience many things in books that we could not see or experience in the past.

### 读“鬼书”有感

    读“鬼书”有感
    章沛
    鬼书的确是不妨读读的，因为其中很有一些人道理值得人们思索，不过，我觉得读鬼书应该读得其法，否则可能“着鬼迷”。
    记得幼年时也欢喜看鬼书，对“聊斋志异”感到很有些兴趣，读起来痛快；对“子不语”就觉得除了恐怖外，味道不浓；“阅微草堂笔记”则容易看出纪晓岚明明在那里借鬼骂人，宣扬“道理”。那时我未学马克思列宁主义，对道理的好坏是不懂得的，认为里面也颇有些“至理名言”。把这看法写进当时作为学校窗课的日记中，就传染了班主任，连他也手执一卷了。可见鬼书的确也有些吸引力。
    后来年纪大了些，接触了马克思列宁主义理论，但仍然爱翻鬼书，由于对道理分得出臭香，看鬼书就看出苗头来了。原来鬼书虽说的是人道理，可是人道理却也有各式各样的。
    蒲松龄的“聊斋志异”之所以看来痛快，原来这里面，狐鬼大都颇有“侠气”，得到好结果的都是穷书生、小人物；至于那些“一人之下，万人之上”的达官贵人，在作者笔下大都成了谴责、嘲骂的对象，“续黄粱”“黄九郎”“天宫”以及类似的一堆故事，都有这样的味道。后来又读读历史，才知道蒲松龄颇有意于反映明末清初的一些社会不平现象，他的创作则是继承着明末市民文学以及较开明绅士的拟话本的思想传统的。虽然蒲松龄也宣传了不少因果、轮回的谬说，可是对生于二十世纪科学昌明时代的我来说，影响是微乎其微了。
    纪晓岚的“阅微草堂笔记”，文采有余，有时也有些清隽的小故事，但总的思想则是颇为反动的。纪晓岚写的鬼，嘲骂的对象是穷书生、奴仆等等的小人物或者是坚持“无鬼论”的知识分子。书里，表忠教孝，俨然是道貌岸然的“君子”。纪晓岚是乾隆皇帝的宠臣，又是修撰四库全书的大人物，身负“思想统制”的重任，他不宣扬封建道德，“君臣大义”那才怪呢。对于当时我们这些爱闹革命的年青小子来说，印象最深的是他居然骂了吕留良，说他明亡时不死，偏留下性命来写“反诗”，称之为“进退失据”，言下之意，族诛、戮尸等等残酷的镇压手段，都是千该万该了。这个印象，至今回想，犹有余愤。
    袁子才这人虽然以“清高”自命，其实却是“翩然一只云中鹤，飞去飞来宰相衙”的“清客”人物。他的鬼书除了写得古怪、恐怖、诲淫之外，读来颇索然无味，性质倒像现在资本主义美国盛行的恐怖小说。
    由此看来，同是谈狐说鬼，但在狐鬼后边隐藏着的立场、观点、方法可不一样。看鬼书而不运用阶级分析的方法，就很难免于“着鬼迷”。扩而言之，读人书亦何独不然。帝国主义者、资产阶级的反动学者之流，虽然俨然人样，但却是专讲鬼话的，一不留神，就有被迷的危险。
    书要活读，要运用马克思列宁主义的眼光来读。能够这样，就会使我们在书中看到、体会到许多过去所看不到、体会不到的东西。
