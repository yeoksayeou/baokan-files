Xinhua News Agency, 5th dispatch: The Chinese Philosophical Society held three academic seminars in Beijing in early and mid-May,展开ing discussions on issues such as logic, the inheritance of China's philosophical heritage and Lao Tzu's philosophical thoughts, and the problem of subjective initiative and objective laws. Participants in the seminars included Pan Zinian, Jin Yuelin, He Lin, Wang Dianji, Shen Youding, and Lin Yushi from the Institute of Philosophy of the Chinese Academy of Sciences; Yang Xianzhen, Ai Siqi, Sun Dingguo, and Fan Ruoyu from the Senior Party School; Zheng Xin, Feng Ding, Feng Youlan, Wang Li, Zhang Yi, Zhu Qianzhi, Wang Xianjun, Huang Zitong, Ren Hua, Ren Jiyu, and Li Shifan from Peking University; Hu Xikui, Wang Fangming, Huang Shunji, and Xiang Liujun from Renmin University of China; and Du Guoxiang, Hou Wailu, Lü Zhenyu, Ji Wenfu, Guan Feng, and Ma Te from other related academic institutions, totaling over 500 people. Six papers on philosophical research and nine papers on logic research were read or submitted in writing at the meeting. Everyone expressed their opinions freely, and the discussions were very lively.

The "False Premise, Correct Form" Reasoning Issue Received the Most Discussion

In the discussion of logic issues, topics included the relationship between the correctness of reasoning forms and the truthfulness of premise content, the objective basis of formal logic laws, the relationship between logic and language, and whether formal logic has a cognitive function. Among these, the relationship between the correctness of reasoning forms and the truthfulness of premise content received the most attention. Li Shifan from Peking University stated that the proposition "false premise, correct form" in syllogisms is incorrect, as it separates form from content. From the perspective of practice and reflection theory, when a correct form combines with a false premise, they are both erroneous because they incorrectly organize the premise and conclusion, and inaccurately reflect the relationships of things. Therefore, he argued that a syllogism with a true premise and an incorrect form is illogical, and a syllogism with a false premise and a "correct form" is also illogical. Some speakers agreed with this view, while others disagreed or only partially agreed. Xiang Liujun and Huang Shunji from Renmin University, among others, first refuted this claim, arguing that this view would lead to blurring the distinction between truthfulness and correctness. Xiang Liujun said: When the truth or falsehood of a premise has not yet been proven, people can sometimes assume it to be true to conduct reasoning. We cannot, based on the proof of the truth or falsehood of a premise, believe that the reasoning form also changes accordingly in terms of right or wrong. At the same time, in fact, inferences with false premises and correct forms do exist. For example:

	Metals cannot be melted
	Gold is a metal
	Gold cannot be melted

The premise of this reasoning is untrue, but the reasoning form structure is a first-figure AAA mood, which is correct. We cannot say that the principle on which this reasoning form is based (the axiom of the syllogism) is also wrong because of the falsehood of the premise "metals cannot be melted." Wang Fangming also argued from both the history of thought development and the current state of thought that the correctness of the reasoning form structure and the truthfulness of thinking are not always unified. In the debate, Xiang Liujun and Li Shifan agreed on many points. They both believed that the science of formal logic serves the pursuit of truth and that being logical must be consistent with the facts. Therefore, Li Shifan believed that formal logic cannot serve the reactionary class, and Xiang Liujun believed that formal logic cannot serve sophistry. Zhu Bo disagreed with their opinions. He believed that formal logic is powerless regarding the truth or falsehood of premise content. If requiring premise truthfulness is made one of the conditions of formal logic, this would not prevent the reactionary class from using formal logic to serve them because different classes can give fundamentally different interpretations to the standard of truth. If formal logic necessarily requires premise truthfulness, it would inevitably include dialectical materialism within formal logic.

Opinions on Whether Lao Tzu's Philosophy is a Materialist or Idealist Thought System Clashed Head-on

At the discussion on the inheritance of philosophical heritage, Ren Jiyu, Guan Feng, Feng Youlan, Ren Hua, Miao Litian, and others spoke to further discuss the purpose, tasks, and methods of the study of philosophy history. Feng Youlan also read relevant sections from his recently published book "Forty Years of Retrospect" at the meeting. The meeting also展开ed a heated discussion on whether Lao Tzu's philosophical system is idealist or materialist. Ren Jiyu and Feng Jingyuan argued that Lao Tzu was a materialist, while Guan Feng and Lin Yushi argued that Lao Tzu was an idealist. Both sides fully elaborated their views and arguments at the meeting. Ren Jiyu and Feng Jingyuan argued that although Lao Tzu's "Dao" is soundless and formless (silent and empty), it is not elusive or unrecognizable. The Dao is a chaotic mass of matter from which the world arises, containing change and the laws of change. Lao Tzu's "Dao" is not outside things but within them. They believe that the central issue in the struggle between idealism and materialism during the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods was the struggle between advocating a "volitional heaven" and advocating "the natural way of heaven." Lao Tzu's materialist view of "the natural way of heaven" objectively opposed religious superstition and declared war on heaven and emperors, which was progressive at the time. Guan Feng and Lin Yushi's opinion was that Lao Tzu's philosophical system has materialist tendencies or elements, but is fundamentally objective idealism. They believe that the first chapter of Lao Tzu's book is the outline of this philosophical system, and its basic categories are constant non-being and constant being. They analyzed the first chapter and other relevant chapters of Lao Tzu's book, thus arguing that Lao Tzu's "Dao" is the unity of "constant being" and "constant non-being"; "constant non-being" refers to things that are not concrete and tangible, and "constant being" refers to things that exist constantly. Because the "Dao" is not a concrete and tangible thing, it exists constantly. "Constant being" and "constant non-being" are unified in "constant non-being," so Lao Tzu's "Dao" is also emptiness. Since Lao Tzu's "Dao" is emptiness, a trans-temporal and spatial "absolute," and it is the "thing" that produces the universe, of course, it can only be something like "absolute spirit." They also argued from Lao Tzu's denial of perceptual knowledge and the incompleteness of Lao Tzu's dialectics (emphasizing "unity" as absolute) that Lao Tzu was an objective idealist. Then Tang Yijie, Feng Youlan, Lü Zhenyu, Hou Wailu, He Lin, Ji Wenfu, Huang Zitong, Zhang Hengshou and others spoke successively, presenting their views on this issue. The speakers all held their own opinions and had their own arguments. The two opinions were sharply opposed, and the discussion atmosphere was very active at the meeting.

Preliminary Exchange of Views on the Dialectical Relationship Between Subjective Initiative and Objective Laws

The discussion on subjective initiative and objective laws was aimed at philosophically clarifying the dialectical relationship between subjective initiative and objective laws and studying how to fully发挥 subjective initiative in the practice of socialist construction based on objective laws. In the discussion, everyone expressed their opinions on this issue from various aspects and preliminarily exchanged their views. At the meeting, Sun Dingguo also spoke on the issue of "the mass line and working methods" in connection with the issue of 发挥ing the subjective initiative of the masses, theoretically expounding that the Party's mass line is the Party's fundamental working method, and that the Party's working method is the concrete embodiment of dialectical materialism in working methods.

The three academic seminars held by the Chinese Philosophical Society are part of a series of academic seminars held by the academic community in the capital to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the "May Fourth" Movement. This discussion was conducted on the basis of past discussions, and some preparations were made before the meeting, so the content of the meeting was relatively substantial. The comrades who participated in the meeting believed that this discussion played a positive role in further promoting the开展 of academic research.

    开展自由讨论　推进学术研究
    中国哲学会连续举行逻辑问题等三个学术讨论会
    新华社5日讯　中国哲学会于5月上中旬在北京连续举行了三个学术讨论会，就逻辑问题、中国哲学遗产的继承问题和老子的哲学思想问题、主观能动性与客观规律性问题等，展开了讨论。参加讨论会的，有中国科学院哲学研究所潘梓年、金岳霖、贺麟、汪奠基、沈有鼎、林聿时等，高级党校杨献珍、艾思奇、孙定国、范若愚等，北京大学郑昕、冯定、冯友兰、王力、张颐、朱谦之、王宪钧、黄子通、任华、任继愈、李世繁等，中国人民大学胡锡奎、王方名、黄顺基、向刘骏等，以及其他有关学术机关杜国庠、侯外庐、吕振羽、稽文甫、关锋、马特等共五百余人。会上宣读或作书面发言的有关哲学研究的论文六篇，有关逻辑问题研究的论文九篇。大家各抒己见，讨论十分热烈。
    “前提虚假，形式正确”的推理形式问题发言最多
    在逻辑问题的讨论中，涉及到推理形式的正确性与前提内容的真实性的关系、形式逻辑规律的客观基础、逻辑与语言的关系、形式逻辑是否有认识作用等问题，其中就推理形式的正确性与前提内容的真实性的关系这一问题发言的最多。北京大学的李世繁发言认为，在三段论里，“前提虚假、形式正确”的提法是错误的，这是脱离内容来看形式。用实践和反映论的观点来看，当正确形式和虚假前提相结合的时候，它们是错误的，因为这时它们是对前提和结论起了一种错误的组织作用，是对事物关系的一种错误反映。因而他说，前提真实、形式错误的三段论固然不合逻辑，而前提虚假、“形式正确”的三段论也是不合逻辑的。有人发言同意这个意见，也有人不同意或不完全同意这个意见。人民大学的向刘骏、黄顺基等首先反驳这一说法，他们认为这种看法会导致抹杀真实性与正确性之间的区别。向刘骏说：当前提真假尚未证明的情况下，有时人们也可以断定它为真来进行推论，我们不能因为前提真假的被证明，而认为推理形式也相应的有对错的变化。同时，事实上，假的前提、正确的形式的推论也是存在的。如：
    金属是不能熔化的金子是金属
    金子是不能熔化的
    这个推理前提是不真实的，但推理形式结构是一格的AAA式，是正确的。不能因为“金属不能熔化”这个前提的虚假，而说这一推理形式所根据的原则
  （三段论公理）也错误。王方名也从思维发展史和思维现状两方面来论证推理形式结构的正确和思维的真实从来并不都是统一的。在问题争论中，向刘骏在许多问题上与李世繁有一致的地方，他们都认为形式逻辑这门科学是为求真理服务的，合乎逻辑必须合乎事实，因此李世繁认为形式逻辑不能为反动阶级服务，向刘骏认为形式逻辑不能为诡辩服务。朱波不同意他们的意见。他认为，对于前提内容的真假，形式逻辑是无能为力的。如果把要求前提真实列为形式逻辑的条件之一，这也并不能防止反动阶级利用形式逻辑为他们服务。因为关于真实的标准，各个不同的阶级可以作根本不同的解释。如果形式逻辑一定要求前提真实，就势必要把辩证唯物主义包括到形式逻辑里来。
    老子哲学是唯物或唯心的思想体系的意见针锋相对
    在哲学遗产的继承问题的讨论会上，任继愈、关锋、冯友兰、任华、苗力田等发言进一步讨论了哲学史研究的目的、任务和方法，冯友兰并在会上宣读了他最近出版的“四十年回顾”一书中的有关部分。会上还对老子哲学思想体系是唯心主义还是唯物主义这一问题展开了热烈讨论。任继愈、冯憬远主张老子是唯物主义的，关锋、林聿时主张老子是唯心主义的，双方在会上充分阐述各自的见解和论据。任继愈、冯憬远的意见认为：老子的“道”虽然是无声无形（寂兮寥兮）但并不是不可捉摸，不可认识的。道是世界赖以发生的一团混沌的物质，有变化，也包含变化的法则。老子的“道”不是在事物之外，而是在事物之中。他们认为春秋战国时代唯心主义与唯物主义斗争的中心问题，是主张“有意志的天”和主张“天道自然”的斗争，老子“天道自然”的唯物主义观点，在客观上主要是反对宗教迷信，对天、帝宣战，在当时是有进步意义的。关锋、林聿时的意见则认为：老子的哲学体系有唯物主义倾向或因素，但基本上是客观唯心主义的。他们认为老子书第一章是这个哲学体系的纲领，它的基本范畴是常无、常有。他们分析了老子书第一章和其他有关各章，从而论证说，老子的“道”是“常有”、“常无”的统一；“常无”指不是具体有形的事物，“常有”指经常存在，因为“道”不是具体有形的事物，所以它经常存在。“常有”和“常无”是统一于“常无”，所以老子的“道”也即是虚无。既然老子的“道”是虚无，是超时空的“绝对”，而它又是产生宇宙万物的“东西”，当然，它只能是“绝对精神”之类了。他们还从老子的否认感性认识和老子的辩证法的不彻底性（即将“统一”强调为绝对的），论证老子是客观唯心主义的。接着有汤一介、冯友兰、吕振羽、侯外庐、贺麟、稽文甫、黄子通、张恒寿等先后发言，提出他们对这一问题的看法。发言人都各持己见，各有论据。两种意见针锋相对，会场上，讨论空气十分活跃。
    初步交换了主观能动性和客观规律性辩证关系的意见
    关于主观能动性和客观规律性的讨论，是为了从哲学上阐明主观能动性和客观规律性的辩证关系，研究如何依据客观规律，在社会主义建设实践中充分发挥主观能动作用的问题。在讨论中，大家从各方面对这个问题发表了意见，初步交换了各自的见解。会上，孙定国还联系发挥群众主观能动性的问题，就“群众路线和工作方法”问题作了发言，从理论上阐述了党的群众路线是党的根本的工作方法，党的工作方法是辩证唯物主义在工作方法上的具体体现。
    中国哲学会举行这三个学术讨论会，是首都学术界纪念“五四”运动四十周年而举行的一系列的学术讨论会中的一部分。这次讨论会是在过去讨论的基础上进行的，会前，又作了一些准备，所以会议内容比较充实。与会同志认为，这次讨论会对于进一步推动学术研究工作的开展，起了良好的作用。
