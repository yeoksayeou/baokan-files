    Xu Yanzhi
    By our reporter Liu Yaoli
            First Impression
    I first met Xu Yanzhi at the end of May, when the tool workshop of the Xiangtan Jiangnan Machinery Factory was summarizing his experience of not producing defective products for more than eight years.

    The meeting had just ended. A young worker rushed over and said, "Oh no, Master Xu has produced a defective product for the first time in eight years." Everyone rushed to the inspection team with surprise and anxiety. Xia Zhiyan, a forty-year-old inspector, was re-examining the chuck made by Xu Yanzhi. He looked at the finish, which fully met the standard, and he measured the thickness with calipers, which was also perfect. However, when re-examining the inner diameter and diameter, it was five millimeters too large. Obviously, this was a "defective product" that had to be reworked. Everyone felt sorry for Master Xu, who had not produced a defective product for more than eight years. At the same time, a suspicion was raised: why did he produce a defective product?

    At this time, an old master with a short stature, gray hair, old-fashioned glasses on his nose, and a resolute look on his face came over. He was Xu Yanzhi. After he learned about the inspection process, he was not worried at all, but smiled and said, "This morning, when I was machining this chuck, I saw that the drawing required four gear teeth to be milled out of the inner circle of the chuck. I looked at it for a long time and felt that it was not easy to scribe the lines. If the lines were not scribed well, it would be easy to produce defective products on the milling machine. Later, I told the technical team about this, and as a result of our joint research, we decided to leave these five millimeters of allowance." Speaking of this, he suddenly felt a little embarrassed, and then said, "I was busy rushing to complete the task and didn't ask them to sign, which caused this commotion." At this time, everyone not only felt relieved, but also deeply moved by Xu Yanzhi's noble quality of thinking about others.
              At the Lathe
    Full of respect, we came to the lathe where Xu Yanzhi worked. At this time, the factory's morning whistle had just sounded; he had already done all the preparations before work and was preparing to machine a circular part. First, he ran the lathe idle for four or five minutes to check all the parts of the machine. Only when he was satisfied with everything did he start working. We watched as his tools, fixtures, and measuring instruments were placed in an orderly manner. If he needed to take anything, he could reach out and grab it while looking at the work. The lathe he used was an old-fashioned eight-foot Japanese lathe that was more than forty years old. Although three shifts of people worked on this lathe every day, he always wiped it clean before and after each shift. Seeing this scene, I thought to myself that this was probably an important experience for Master Xu to ensure quality.

    A young man worked in the same production team as Xu Yanzhi. When he talked about Master Xu's stories, he was always eloquent. Although Xu Yanzhi is a seventh-grade master with 45 years of experience, he is also very experienced. However, he never considers himself a "veteran" and is very modest and eager to learn. In April of this year, he received a strange and difficult job. The outer diameter of this job was 620 mm, the inner diameter was 480 mm, and the thickness was only 20 mm. The area of this processed part was large and thin. He repeatedly looked at it several times and always felt that it was not easy to machine. He has a habit of never easily starting work until he has come up with a good solution when he encounters a difficult job. Coincidentally, Li Jiewen, a Communist Youth League member and second-grade lathe operator, came over. The two of them discussed it repeatedly for a long time before selecting a fixture suitable for the shape of this workpiece. Only then did they proceed with the machining. As a result, not only was there no error, but it was also convenient and fast to machine, and the task was completed within the specified time.

    We were talking enthusiastically when Master Xu suddenly put his ear close to the lathe and listened for a while. Then, he turned off the lathe. It turned out that a gear on the machine had a problem. After some repairs, the lathe started up again. Master Xu smiled and said to us, "This lathe is already more than 40 years old, and many gears have been worn out, and the accuracy is not very accurate, but I am very familiar with its temper and can still handle it." Then, he pulled the tool holder with his hand and said, "I have to pull the tool holder with my hand to prevent the 'incense stick' from moving and protect the accuracy." Sure enough, we saw that the things he machined fully met the quality standards.
        The Story of the Male Mold and Female Mold
    Many old workers said that after Master Xu accepted a task, the first step was to study the drawings, and he would not start working until he had thoroughly understood the drawings. Therefore, not only did he ensure that he did not produce defective products, but he also eliminated some errors in the drawings.

    Once, the technical team sent an assembly drawing of a male and female mold. The size (arc) of the female mold was 15 mm, while the size of the male mold on the part drawing was 8 mm. He put on his reading glasses and looked at it again and again, and always felt that something was wrong. He gestured with his hand for a while, but still couldn't figure out why the sizes of the male and female molds were so different. A young worker next to him saw that he was messing with the drawings for a long time and still didn't start the lathe, so he anxiously said to him, "Master Xu, why don't you hurry up and start the lathe? Do you want your quota? What are you looking at?"

      "I always feel that the dimensions on the drawing are wrong. I'm still figuring it out!" The old master looked up at the young man and wanted to go over and discuss it with him.

    "There are mistakes on the drawing? Just do it according to the drawing. If you make a mistake, you won't be responsible! Start the lathe quickly!" The young worker even made a face at him.

    "Hey, no responsibility! You've been a worker for more than a year, and you haven't even figured out what responsibility is! The country's property is not a joke, you have to study hard!"

    After the technical team checked and verified, the drawing was indeed wrong. Only then did Master Xu happily start the lathe and enthusiastically start working according to the revised drawing. The rhythmic sound of the lathe seemed to be singing a song of praise to him.

    At this time, the young worker gently walked over and said excitedly to him, "Master! You gave me the most important lesson today. I will never forget what happened today." The old master couldn't figure out what was going on, and after thinking for a while, he smiled and said, "You must always remember that you are a worker!"

            第一个印象
    我第一次认识徐延志，是在5月底，那时这湘潭江南机器厂的工具车间，正在总结他八年多未出废品的经验。
    会议刚结束。一个青年工人匆匆跑来说：“糟了，徐师傅在八年中第一次出了废品。”大家怀着惊奇、紧张的心情赶到了检验组。四十多岁的检验员夏志炎正在再一次复验徐延志做的夹具卡头。他看了看光洁度，完全符合标准，他又用卡尺量了量厚薄，一点也不差，可是，复验到内圆径和直径时，却多出了五公厘。很明显，这是一个必须返工的“废品”了。大家都在为这位八年多没出过废品的徐师傅难过。同时也提出了一个怀疑：他为什么出了废品呢？
    这时候，一位身材矮小，须发花白，鼻梁上架着一副老光眼镜、脸上呈现着一股刚毅神色的老师傅走来了。他就是徐延志。当他知道检验的经过以后，一点也不着急，反笑嘻嘻地说：“今天上午，我在车这个卡头的时候，看到图纸要求在卡头内圆还要铣工铣出四个齿牙轮，我看了半天，感到不好划线，如果不划好线，一上铣床便容易出废品。后来我把这个意见告诉了技术组，和他们共同研究的结果，决定留下了这五公厘余量。”说到这里，他突然感到有些不好意思，接着又说：“一时忙着赶任务，没请他们签个字，却引起了这一场风波”。这时，在场的人，不但心里都落下一块石头，而且，大家对徐延志这种为别人着想的崇高品质而深受感动。
              在车床边
    我们满怀敬意，来到徐延志工作的车床旁边，这时厂里上午上班的汽笛声刚响过；他已把上班前的一切准备工作都做好了，正准备车一个圆形的部件。首先他走了四、五分钟的空车，检查了一遍机床上的各个部件，一切感到满意了，才开车干活。我们看着他的工、卡、量具都放得有条不紊，要拿一件什么，眼睛看着活，伸手便可拿到。他使的车床，是一部四十多年的老式八呎日本车床，虽然每天有三班人在这个车床上工作，他每次上班前下班后，总是要擦得亮堂堂的。看到这个情景，我心里就想，这恐怕也是徐师傅保证质量的一条重要经验吧。
    一个青年小伙子和徐延志在一个生产小组里工作。当他谈起徐师傅的一些故事的时候，总是滔滔不绝。徐延志虽是一个有四十五年工龄的七级老师傅，经验也很丰富，可是，他从来不以“老经验”自居。非常谦虚好学。今年4月，他接到一个奇怪而很难加工的活，这个活的外径有六百二十公厘，内径四百八十公厘，而厚却只有二十公厘，这个加工件的面积大而单薄得出奇，他反复地看了几次，总觉不好车。他有一个习惯，每遇到难作的活儿，在未想出好的办法以前，总不轻易下手。恰好，这时共青团员、二级车工李介文走来了，他们两人在一起反复商量了好大一阵，才选好了一种适合于这个工件形状的夹具，然后才进行加工，结果不但没出一点差错，而且车起来又方便又快，在规定的时间内完成了任务。
    我们正在谈得起劲，徐师傅忽然把耳朵挨着车床听了一阵，接着，就把车关了。原来机床上有一个齿轮出了毛病。经过了一番修理，车子又叫起来了。徐师傅笑着对我们说：“这部车床已经有四十多岁，许多齿轮都磨蚀了，精密度也不很准确，可是，我对它的脾气很熟悉，还能驾得住它。”接着，他用手拉着刀架说：“我只好用手拉着刀架，使‘香条’不走动，来保护精密度。”果然，我们看他车出来的东西完全合乎质量标准。
        公模和母模的故事
    许多老工人说，徐师傅在接受任务以后，第一步就是研究图纸，不把图纸弄得一清二白就不动手。因此，不但保证了自己不出废品，也消灭了图纸上的一些差错。
    有一次，技术组送来了一张公母模子的装配图纸，母模的尺（圆弧）是十五公厘，而零件图的公模尺却是八公厘，他戴上老花眼镜看了又看，总觉得不对头，又用手比划了一阵，还是想不通公模和母模的尺寸为什么相差这样大。旁边有个青年工人看到他弄了一大阵图纸，还不开车，就着急地对他说：“徐老师傅，你还不赶快开车做，你的定额任务要不要，尽看些什么？”
      “我总觉得图纸上的尺寸不对，现在还在捉摸呢！”老师傅抬起头来看看这个青年人，本想走过去和他商量一下。
    “图纸上还有错的？你照着图纸做好了。万一做错了也没有什么责任！快开车吧！”青年工人还对他做了一个鬼脸。
    “嘿，没有责任！当了一年多工人了，连什么叫责任还没弄清楚！国家的财产可不是闹着玩的，你得好好学习学习啊！”
    经过技术组的检查核对，图纸果然是错了。徐老师傅才愉快地开动车床，兴高采烈的按改动后的图纸开始干活，有节奏的车床的响声，似乎在给他唱一首赞美的歌曲。
    这时，青年工人轻轻地走过来激动地对他说：“老师傅！你今天给我上了最重要的一课。我永远也忘不了今天的事情。”老师傅猛一下摸不着头脑，想了一下才笑着说：“你要永远记着，你是一个工人！”
