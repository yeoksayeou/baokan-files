    Pressing Forward in Victory
    ——Congratulating the Complete Victory on the Steel Front

    In the red May, the national steel front reported complete victories, scoring a great triumph in production. Among them, Anshan Iron and Steel (Ansteel), on the basis of month-by-month production increases, comprehensively overfulfilled the state plan in major products such as steel, pig iron, steel products, coke, sintered ore, and iron ore. The quality of various products was also generally improved compared to April. The socialist labor competition for high quality and high yield, which began in May among all workers on the steel front, has already borne fruit. We extend warm congratulations to all the workers of all steel enterprises!

    Ansteel occupies an important position on the steel front. During the First Five-Year Plan period, all Ansteel workers, with the support of the people of the whole country, made great contributions to the country. In 1958, Ansteel produced more than half of the total steel output produced by modern steel enterprises in the country. In this year's national planned steel production, Ansteel's steel production will still account for a huge proportion. The success or failure of Ansteel's production is crucial to the completion of this year's national steel production plan, and even to the completion of this year's national basic construction plan. The news that Ansteel achieved a complete victory in red May, with the output of various major products increasing month by month, is undoubtedly a great encouragement to the people of the whole country who are striving to achieve a continued great leap forward in the national economy this year.

    Steel enterprises, especially large-scale iron and steel complexes, have closely linked plants, mines, workshops, and processes, with tight organization. In such large-scale complexes, it is often more difficult and complex to ensure that production proceeds rhythmically and that output increases month by month than in general small and medium-sized enterprises. It requires both a vigorous mass movement and a high degree of centralized leadership; both the full play of the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of workers and strict scientific and technical management and production management; both competition between plants, mines, workshops, and processes to promote each other, and close coordination and cooperation between them. Overemphasizing one aspect while slightly neglecting the other will cause huge losses in production. Ansteel's month-by-month production increases since the beginning of this year, and its complete victory in May, are the result of the improvement of the technical level of the workers, the gradual deepening of the mass movement, and the further improvement of the enterprise's production organization and leadership work. This is also the root cause of the victories achieved by other steel enterprises.

    When we say that the production of large-scale iron and steel complexes is complex, and that it is not easy to increase production month by month, we are by no means saying that the production of large-scale iron and steel enterprises cannot be improved any further, and that they do not need to learn from other enterprises. The possibilities for technological progress are infinite, and the most important thing is to be good at learning. Taking Ansteel as an example, all its workers are not satisfied with their achievements, and they are earnestly learning from the advanced experience of fraternal enterprises to improve their work. While congratulating all the workers on the steel front for overfulfilling the state plan for May, we also hope that they will continue to exert their efforts, improve their technology, improve their technical management and production management, promote the spirit of mutual cooperation, and advance in victory. We believe that under the leadership of the Party, all the workers on the steel front will surely win greater victories in the future and will surely make greater contributions to national construction!

    乘胜前进
    ——祝贺钢铁战线全线大捷
    在红五月里，全国钢铁战线全线报捷，在生产上打了一个大胜仗。其中，鞍钢在生产逐月上升的基础上，在钢、生铁、钢材、焦炭、烧结矿、铁矿石等主要产品方面，全面超额完成国家计划，各种产品质量也比4月份普遍提高。钢铁战线上全体职工在5月份开始开展的优质高产社会主义劳动竞赛，已经开花结果。我们谨向各钢铁企业的全体职工，致以热烈的祝贺！
    在钢铁战线上，占居重要地位的是鞍钢。在第一个五年计划期间，鞍钢全体职工在全国人民的支援下，为国家作出了伟大的贡献。1958年，在全国近代化钢铁企业生产的钢的总产量中，鞍钢生产的占一半以上。在今年全国计划生产的钢产量中，鞍钢生产的钢仍将占着巨大的比重。鞍钢生产的好坏，对完成今年国家的钢铁生产计划，甚至对完成今年全国的基本建设计划，都是举足轻重的。鞍钢在红五月里全线大捷，各种主要产品产量逐月上升的消息，对于正在为争取实现今年国民经济继续大跃进而奋斗的全国人民，无疑是巨大的鼓舞。
    钢铁企业，特别是大型钢铁联合企业，各个厂矿、各个车间、各个工序之间，都是环环相扣，组织严密。在这样大型联合企业里，要使生产有节奏地进行，使产量月月上升，往往比一般中小型企业艰巨得多，复杂得多。它既需要有轰轰烈烈的群众运动，又需要有高度的集中领导；既需要广大职工群众发挥高度的积极性和创造性，又需要严格的科学的技术管理和生产管理；既需要各厂矿、车间、工序之间开展竞赛，互相促进，又需要它们之间密切配合，互相协作。过分强调一面而稍为忽视另一面，就会造成生产的巨大损失。鞍钢今年以来生产逐月上升，5月份全线大捷，正是职工群众技术水平提高、群众运动逐步深入、企业生产组织工作和领导工作进一步改善的结果。而这也同样是其它钢铁企业取得胜利的根源。
    我们说大型钢铁联合企业生产复杂，说使生产逐月上升不容易，绝不是说大型钢铁企业的生产不能再提高了，可以不需要向其它企业学习了。技术进步的可能性是无限的，最重要的问题是要善于学习。以鞍钢为例，他们全体职工并没有满足于他们的成就，他们正在认真地学习兄弟企业的先进经验，以改进自己的工作。我们在祝贺钢铁战线全体职工超额完成5月份国家计划的同时，也希望他们继续鼓足干劲，提高技术，改进技术管理和生产管理，发扬互相协作的精神，乘胜前进。我们相信，在党的领导下，钢铁战线的全体职工今后一定可以夺得更大的胜利，一定会为国家建设作出更大的贡献！
