　　Might as Well Give It a Try
　　A rural canteen in Heishan County, Liaoning Province, used the "corn consumption increase method" to fully utilize the nutritional value of corn, increasing the amount of rice produced, making it taste good, and making it more filling. This is a good way to use grain rationally! It is suggested that various places might as well give it a try. Can similar methods to the corn consumption increase method be created for the consumption of other grains? Everyone should use their brains and think of ways.
　　Of course, when researching, experimenting with, and promoting any new method, we must prevent subjectivism and commandism. That is to say, we must fully consult with the masses and conduct experiments with the masses. Only in this way can things be done smoothly and well.

    不妨试一试
    辽宁黑山县的一个农村食堂用“玉米食用增量法”，充分发挥了玉米的营养价值，出饭量增加，味道好吃，而且耐饿。这是合理用粮的一个好办法！建议各地不妨试一试。其他粮种的食用，是否也可以创造出类似玉米食用增量法的办法呢？大家都来动动脑筋，想想办法。
    当然，在研究试验和推广任何一种新的方法的时候，一定要防止主观主义和命令主义的作法。就是说，要充分地和群众商量，和群众一起去作试验，只有这样，事情才办得通、办得好。
