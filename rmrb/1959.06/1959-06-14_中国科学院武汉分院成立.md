Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, June 13th: The Wuhan Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has been officially established recently. Li Da has been appointed as the president.

After more than a year of preparation, the Wuhan Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, in terms of organizational structure, has newly established thirteen units, including the original Institute of Hydrobiology, one after another, namely the Institute of Mathematical Computing Technology, the Institute of Upper Atmosphere Physics, the Institute of Philosophy and Social Sciences, the Institute of Chemistry, the Institute of Mechanics, the Institute of Electronics, the Institute of Metal and Metallurgy, and the Institute of Mechanical Engineering. During the preparation period, under the guidance of the policy of serving national economic construction through scientific research, the research units of the branch completed and basically completed a number of research projects in the second half of last year, among which twenty-seven were relatively major. The Institute of Electronics successfully trial-produced transducers for ultrasonic steelmaking treatment, the Institute of Hydrobiology successfully researched natural fertilizer for paddy fields—nitrogen-fixing blue algae, and the Botanical Garden cooperated with the Biology Department of Wuhan University to complete the 800,000-word "Wuhan Plant Manual," and so on. In the future, in addition to preparing strength and conducting research on certain cutting-edge sciences and basic theories, it will concentrate its efforts on ensuring the completion of national tasks and the research on major issues in the current local national economic construction.
