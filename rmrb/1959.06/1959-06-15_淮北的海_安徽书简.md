The Sea of Huaibei
—Anhui Letter
Shi Fangyu

It’s been four years since I left the seaside! You know I often miss the ocean. Sometimes, even in my dreams, I feel as if I'm bathing in the sea, floating and sinking with the waves.

That year, we reluctantly left the coastal city, gazing out the window of the train at the expanse of blue where the sea met the sky. At that time, we debated a question: where is the bluest water? I said the bluest water is none other than the vast expanse of blue waves outside Qingdao beach, but you raved about the misty blur of Hong Kong's Repulse Bay.

Since then, I've traveled to many places. No matter where I go, I never forget the bluest water; the farther I am from the sea, the farther I feel the bluest water is from me.

But, to my great surprise, today I have found the bluest water—in a place far, far away from the sea. The bluest water is actually on the Huaibei Plain.

Please don't laugh at me and say it's a daydream. No, I'm very serious about this. You've heard about the river network in Huaibei, right? Before coming to Huaibei, I heard that the river water here is as blue as the sea. At first, I didn't take it seriously and didn't dare to believe it easily. The river is dug artificially, and it's dug in the endless loess layer of the plain, so I imagined it must be muddy and sandy. That's what I thought then, and I believe you must be thinking the same thing now.

But that's not the case. What kind of water is this! This is the color of a clear, cloudless autumn day in the north, this is glittering jade, this is the color of the sea sleeping peacefully under a bright moon!

Seeing the river water of the Huaibei Plain, I freed myself from the longing for the ocean.

Across the plain, every kilometer, there is a straight river, which is how the river becomes a "network". Each river is ten meters wide and seven or eight meters deep. Because it's dug deep, the water drawn from the Huai River is connected to the spring water under the earth, and the secret of the river water's clear blue lies here.

I rowed a boat from one river into another. I scooped up the clear river water with both hands, as if scooping up nectar from the Milky Way. The color of the seawater is indeed lovely, but its taste is bitter; the blue river water of Huaibei, however, is sweet. How can such sweet nectar not irrigate flourishing crops!

However, water was once a great scourge for the people of Huaibei. You remember the song we often sang in our childhood, which told of ten years of drought in nine. At that time, we lived far away on the southern coast, but the song was about Huaibei. From the wide circulation of the song, we can imagine the severity of its disaster. It was either drought or flood, and both drought and flood were matters of a blink of an eye. The masses here have a very vivid saying: three days without rain, the ground cracks; however, as soon as a toad pees, a large area is flooded again. The farmers worked hard all year round, but often ended up with no harvest.

After liberation, although the disaster situation has undergone fundamental changes, the way to completely solve the problem of drought and flood was truly found last year. Based on the water network in 1957, the Party proposed a river network plan. The depth, width, and spacing of the rivers all have certain specifications. Day and night, thousands of troops and horses on the Huaibei Plain worked hard, and the people of Huaibei, under the leadership of the Party, finally reversed the situation on their disaster-prone plain.

Last year, after digging the river, soon after, there was a seventy-day drought, without a drop of rain. The Huaibei Plain withstood the test: the river water did not dry up; in the paddy fields that appeared on the plain for the first time in history, the rice plants were strong and fragrant for miles. In mid-May this year, there was a rainfall of 127.2 millimeters in one day and night, which is said that in the past, even the ground would float; but now the wheat is unharmed. The Huaibei Plain has once again withstood the test.

Now, standing on the riverbank, looking far into the distance, watching the surging waves around me, I feel as if I am bathing in the sea again. Please don't misunderstand, I'm not talking about the vast expanse of blue waves outside Qingdao beach, I'm talking about another kind of sea: golden waves, a sea of golden wheat.

    淮北的海
    ——安徽书简
    石方禹
    离开海滨有四年的时间了！你知道我时常怀念海洋，有时在睡梦中也会仿佛觉得自己沐浴在海水之中，随着碧波荡漾浮沉。
    那一年我们依依不舍地离开了海边的城市，在火车里凭窗远眺那海天相接处的一片蔚蓝。当时，我们曾经争辩过一个问题：哪里的水最蓝。我说最蓝最蓝的水莫过于青岛沙滩外面的万顷碧波，你却对香港浅水湾的苍茫朦胧赞不绝口。
    在这以后，我又走过很多地方。不论我到哪儿，我总没有忘怀于最蓝最蓝的水；离开海边越远，我就觉得最蓝最蓝的水也离我越远了。
    可是，大出我的意料，今天我竟找到了最蓝最蓝的水——在离开大海遥远遥远的地方，最蓝最蓝的水，竟在淮北平原上。
    请你不要笑话我，说这是痴人说梦。不是的，我是非常严肃地跟你谈这件事。你总听说过关于淮北河网化的事情吧。到淮北来以前，我就听说这里的河水蓝得像海水。当时乍一听来，我也不以为然，不敢轻易置信。河是人工挖出来的，而且挖在平原的无边的黄土层之中，想像中一定是夹泥带沙混浊不堪。当时我这样想，相信此时你一定也会这样想。
    其实不然。这是怎么样的水啊！这是北方秋季万里无云的晴天的颜色，这是晶莹的翡翠，这是风平浪静皓月当空时沉睡着的海水的颜色！
    看到淮北平原的河水，我解脱了对于海洋的如饥如渴的思念。
    平原上纵横每一公里，就是一条笔直的河，这就是河之为“网”的来由。每条河宽十来公尺，深七、八公尺。因为挖得深，从淮河引来的水，和地层底下的泉水接通了，河水的碧清蔚蓝，其秘密就在这里。
    我划着船从一条河驶进另一条河。我用双手舀起碧清的河水，就像舀起天河瑶池里的琼浆玉液。海水的颜色诚然蓝得可爱，但其味苦涩；淮北的碧蓝的河水，其味却是甘甜的。用这样甜美的琼浆玉液，怎能不灌溉出茂盛的庄稼呵！
    然而，水，过去却是淮北人民的大祸害。你记得我们在孩童时代就常常唱的那首诉说十年九荒的歌吗？那时我们住在遥远的南方海边，但歌里唱的却是淮北的事。从歌谣流传之广，可以想见它的灾害之剧。不是旱就是涝，而且旱和涝都是一眨眼之间的事。这里群众有句非常生动的话：三日无雨，地干裂缝；然而，只要蛤蟆屙泡尿，便又淹了一大片。农民们终年辛苦，到头来常常是颗粒无收。
    解放以后，虽然灾情有了根本性的改变，但真正找到彻底解决旱涝问题的途径，还是去年的事情。在1957年水网化的基础上，党提出了河网化的计划。河的深度、宽度和间隔都有一定的规格。朝朝暮暮，淮北平原上千军万马努力奋战，淮北人民在党的领导下，终于在自己的这个多灾多难的平原上扭转了乾坤。
    去年挖了河以后，接着不久，便是七十天的干旱，滴雨未下。淮北平原经受了考验：河水不干；有史以来在平原上第一次出现的水稻田里，稻株茁壮，香飘千里。今年5月中旬，有一天一昼夜之间降雨一百二十七点二公厘，据说要在过去，连地都会漂起来；然而现在麦子却分毫无损。淮北平原再一次经受了考验。
    如今站在河堤上纵目远眺，望着四周围汹涌翻腾着的波浪，我仿佛觉得我又沐浴在大海之中了。请你不要误会，我说的不是青岛沙滩外面的万顷碧波，我说的是另一种大海：金黄色的波浪，金黄色的小麦的海洋。
