Comprehensive report from our newspaper: Rio de Janeiro News: Brazilian President Kubitschek formally announced on June 10 that the Brazilian government would cease negotiations with the "International Monetary Fund" regarding loan issues. This decision has received broad support from domestic public opinion and people from all walks of life in Brazil. Brazilian Army Minister Marshal Lott said in an interview with the "Evening Globe" on the 11th that President Kubitschek's decision reflects national dignity. He believes that the "International Monetary Fund" requires Brazil to obediently accept the terms of the loan, as if it were dealing with a non-independent country.

The Brazilian House of Representatives debated the issue of ceasing loan negotiations with the "International Monetary Fund," and parliamentarians from all parties enthusiastically supported the President's decision to cease negotiations. The Rio de Janeiro Bank Employees Union sent a telegram supporting the patriotic stance taken by the government. Twenty-five priestly officials in São Paulo also sent a telegram to President Kubitschek expressing their support for the government's decision.

Brazilian publications such as the "New Orientation" weekly also published commentaries expressing support for the government's decision. Brazil is one of the more economically developed countries in Latin America. However, due to the impact of the US economic crisis and the implementation of unequal trade by the United States, Brazil is experiencing severe financial and economic difficulties. Kubitschek attempted to resolve Brazil's economic difficulties and maintain the pace of its industrial and economic plans by relying on loans from the United States and the US-controlled "International Monetary Fund." Finance Minister Lucas Lopes also formulated a "National Monetary Stabilization Plan" based on the loan conditions proposed by the "International Monetary Fund." These conditions were: to abolish the official exchange rate for foreign exchange; to devalue the Brazilian currency, the Cruzeiro; to abandon the national monopoly on oil; to restrict credit to reduce industrial production; to halt the construction of public works and freeze wages. This "National Monetary Stabilization Plan," which submitted to the enslaving loan conditions of US monopoly capital and the "International Monetary Fund," aroused dissatisfaction among the Brazilian public.

    停止同美国控制的“国际货币基金组织”谈判
    巴西政府的决定受到公众热烈支持
    本报综合报道　里约热内卢消息：巴西总统库比契克6月10日正式宣布，巴西政府停止同“国际货币基金组织”关于贷款问题的谈判。这一决定受到巴西国内舆论和各阶层人民的广泛支持。巴西陆军部长洛特元帅11日对“地球晚报”发表的谈话说，库比契克总统的决定反映出民族的尊严。他认为“国际货币基金组织”要求巴西顺从地接受贷款的条件，这好像它是在同一个不独立的国家打交道一样。
    巴西众议院就停止同“国际货币基金组织”的贷款谈判这个问题进行了辩论，各党派议员都热烈支持总统关于停止谈判的决定。里约热内卢银行职员工会致电支持政府所采取的爱国主义立场。圣保罗的二十五个祭师典礼官也致电库比契克总统表示支持政府的决定。
    巴西“新方针”周刊等报刊也发表了评论表示支持政府的决定。巴西是拉丁美洲经济比较发达的国家之一。但是，由于受到美国经济危机和美国实行不平等贸易的影响，巴西经历着严重的财政经济困难。库比契克企图借助于美国和由美国控制的“国际货币基金组织”的贷款来解决巴西的经济困难和维持其工业及经济计划的进行速度。财政部长卢卡斯·洛佩斯并且根据“国际货币基金组织”提出的贷款条件，拟定一项“国家货币稳定计划”。这些条件是：取消外汇的官方兑换牌价；使巴西货币克鲁赛罗贬值；放弃国家对于石油的垄断；限制信贷来缩减工业生产；停止公共工程的建设和冻结工资。这个屈从美国垄断资本和“国际货币基金组织”奴役性的贷款条件的“国家货币稳定计划”引起了巴西公众的不满。
