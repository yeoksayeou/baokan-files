Xinhua News Agency, Harbin - Agricultural and commercial departments in Harbin are working closely together to increase vegetable production and quality, organize transportation, and actively improve the market vegetable supply. From January to May of this year, the volume of vegetables on the market has generally increased steadily and has been higher than the same period last year. January saw an increase of 2.83% compared to the same period last year, while May saw an increase of more than double compared to the same period last year.

In the process of organizing vegetable production, agricultural and commercial departments jointly formed working groups to inspect the implementation of vegetable production and sales contracts, identify problems, and discuss solutions together. The two departments held seven or eight on-site meetings on sowing, transplanting, and field management, exchanging experiences and helping commune members in new vegetable-growing areas improve their vegetable-growing techniques. Commercial departments also purchased large quantities of vegetable seeds, seed potatoes, indigenous fertilizer, glass, pesticides, timber, hemp rope, nails, and other production materials to supply the people's communes producing vegetables. In order to supply fresh vegetables to the city residents in a timely manner, people's communes in the suburbs transported vegetables to the city by cart day and night. Vegetable stations in the commercial departments have added more supply points and are making every effort to improve the supply work.

Currently, agricultural and commercial departments are continuing to work closely together to focus on vegetable production in the summer and autumn seasons.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang - Andong City, Liaoning Province, which has historically been unable to produce enough vegetables to meet its own needs, has been supplying more than 500,000 jin of over twenty varieties of vegetables daily since May, ensuring that the city's 350,000 residents have an average of about one and a half jin of fresh vegetables per day. From May 14 to June 10, more than 2.5 million jin of vegetables were transported to support Benxi, Fushun, Shenyang, Anshan, and Jiamusi and other cities.

The fundamental reason why Andong City has gradually achieved self-sufficiency in vegetables this year is that the Party Committee has strengthened its leadership over vegetable production and supply. At the same time, the agricultural and commercial departments have worked closely together, organizing shops that handle vegetables to sign contracts with vegetable production units, implementing guaranteed purchase and sales, which has also played a significant role in promoting vegetable production and sales. To strengthen the integration of vegetable production and sales, starting this spring, the commercial department has transferred more than 20 cadres to the suburban communes to serve as deputy food production instructors, and dozens of vegetable shops in the city have also sent dispatchers to reside in the communes. They participate in the communes' production labor, conduct vegetable production experimental fields, and promptly report on vegetable production, helping the communes solve problems in production. The commercial department has also supplied the communes with a large number of vegetable seeds, chemical fertilizers, cellar poles, glass and other equipment.

Recently, the Andong Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal People's Committee held a special meeting to specifically arrange the autumn vegetable planting plan. The area already arranged for autumn vegetable planting has reached more than 60,000 mu, an increase of one and a half times compared to the same period last year.

    哈尔滨蔬菜上市量比去年同期多一倍
    安东每人每天平均吃到一斤半新鲜菜
    据新华社哈尔滨讯　哈尔滨市农业部门和商业部门密切协作，千方百计地提高蔬菜产量和质量，组织运输，积极做好市场蔬菜供应工作。今年1月到5月，蔬菜上市量基本上是逐步上升的，而且都比去年同期增加，1月份比去年同期增加2.83％，到5月份就比去年同期增加一倍以上。
    在组织蔬菜生产过程中，农业部门和商业部门共同组成工作组，检查蔬菜产销合同落实的情况，发现问题，共同磋商解决。两个部门曾经召开播种、定植和田间管理等现场会议七、八次，交流了经验，帮助新菜区的社员提高了种植蔬菜的技术水平。商业部门还采购了大批菜籽、种薯、土化肥、玻璃、农药、木材、麻绳、钉子等生产资料，供应生产蔬菜的人民公社。近郊各人民公社为了把鲜菜及时供应市内人民，不分昼夜地用大车往城市运菜。商业部门的蔬菜站增设了供应点，尽力做好供应工作。
    当前，农业、商业部门正在继续密切协作，大抓夏秋两季的蔬菜生产。
    据新华社沈阳讯　历年来蔬菜不能自给的辽宁省安东市，从5月份以来，每天上市二十多种蔬菜共五十多万斤，保证了三十五万城市人口每人每天吃到鲜菜一斤半左右。从5月14日到6月10日，还运了二百五十多万斤蔬菜，支援本溪、抚顺、沈阳、鞍山和佳木斯等城市。
    安东市今年逐步做到蔬菜自给的根本原因，是党委加强了对蔬菜生产、供应工作的领导。同时农业部门和商业部门密切协作，组织经营蔬菜的商店，分别同蔬菜生产单位签订合同，实行包购包销，这对推动蔬菜的产销工作也起了重大的作用。为了加强蔬菜产销结合，从今年春季开始，商业部门抽调了二十多名干部到郊区各公社担任副食品生产辅导员，全市几十个经营蔬菜的商店也都派有调拨员驻在公社。他们既参加公社的生产劳动，搞蔬菜生产试验田，又及时反映蔬菜生产情况，帮助公社解决生产中的问题。商业部门还供应了各公社大批蔬菜种子、化学肥料和窖杆、玻璃等器材。
    最近，中共安东市委和市人民委员会又专门召开会议，具体安排了秋菜播种计划。现在已经安排的秋菜播种面积达六万亩以上，比去年同期增加一倍半。
