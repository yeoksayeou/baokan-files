    The Party Secretary of the Commune Feeds Livestock

    One night, around midnight, a male donkey in the feeding room of the Beitou Production Team of the Zhengyang Commune in Yongcheng County, Henan Province, suddenly brayed loudly, startling the three feeders awake. Hou Zhentian quickly lit the lamp and said happily to Secretary Wan, who was beside him, "We haven't heard this sound for months! If it weren't for you, we could never have fed the livestock so well!" They hurried to add grass and feed to the livestock.

    Secretary Wan is Comrade Wan Huaichun, the First Secretary of the Zhengyang Commune Party Committee. Since the county party committee held a meeting for the secretaries and agricultural directors of each commune on May 14 regarding livestock management, he has been feeding five head of livestock at the Beitou Production Team. All of them were third-class livestock, including three donkeys, thin as skin and bones, and afflicted with mange. It took several people to lift them just to get them moving each day. He was determined to fatten these livestock, so he moved into the feeding room to live there. How could he fatten the livestock quickly? He thought that first, he had to cure the mange on the livestock. So, he studied the method of treating mange with veterinary personnel. After the method was determined, he personally prepared the mange medicine and applied it to the livestock. After three treatments, all three livestock with mange were cured. Aside from attending meetings and inspecting work, he spent the rest of his time in this feeding room feeding the livestock, changing the water for washing grass, cleaning the livestock pens, chopping grass, and so on.

    Under Secretary Wan's careful feeding, not only were the three donkeys cured of their illnesses, but they were also able to work.

### 公社党委书记喂牲口

    公社党委书记喂牲口
    一天半夜，河南永城县郑阳公社北头生产队饲养室的一头公驴忽然高声叫喊，把三个饲养员惊醒了。侯振田忙把灯点着，高兴地对挨在他旁边的万书记说：“几个月都没有听到这声音了！要不是你，咋也不能把牲口喂到这样好！”他们赶忙给牲口加草喂料。
    万书记，是郑阳公社党委第一书记万怀春同志。自从县委在5月14日召开各公社管理牲畜的书记和农业部长会议后，他就在北头生产队喂了五头牲畜。全部都是三类牲口，其中驴三头，瘦的皮包骨头，加之长癣，每天都得几个人抬着才能活动活动。他下决心要把这几头牲口喂肥，于是搬到饲养室里去住。怎样才能把牲口很快地喂肥？他想首先要把牲口身上的癣治好。于是，他就同兽医人员研究治癣的方法。方法确定后，他亲自配好癣药，给牲口抹上。经过三次治疗，这三头长癣的牲口全都好了。他除了开会、检查工作以外，其余时间都在这个饲养室里喂牲口、换淘草水、打扫牲口铺、铡草等等。
    在万书记的精心饲养下，不仅给这三头毛驴治好了病，而且已经能干活了。
