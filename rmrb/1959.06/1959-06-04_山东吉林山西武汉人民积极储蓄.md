Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 3rd: The broad masses of peasants in Shandong Province are actively participating in savings, and the amount of rural savings is increasing. According to incomplete statistics, as of mid-May, the province's rural savings amounted to 167 million yuan, an increase of 75.5% over the same period last year.

Cadres of the People's Bank of China and credit cooperatives in Shandong Province have widely publicized the significance of saving to commune members in various forms. In order to facilitate the deposit and withdrawal of money for the masses, they often move around to commune members' homes to handle savings business, and help commune members arrange their lives and formulate savings plans. After hearing the publicity, 114 households in Li Lou, Yu Zhuang, and Sun Zhuang villages of Liangcun Commune in Gaotang County participated in savings within one or two days of receiving their wages. Gaozhuang Management Area of Menglianggu People's Commune in Mengyin County is a barren mountainous area. In the past, commune members did not have the habit of saving. After the publicity of the Party organization and the cadres of the bank and credit cooperative, they carefully planned their expenditures and deposited 4,250 yuan in the bank in 27 days, with deposit households accounting for 85% of the total number of farmers.

Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 3rd: The broad masses of people in Jilin Province have recently actively participated in savings. According to statistics from the Jilin Branch of the People's Bank of China as of May 20, the province's savings deposits had reached 78.27 million yuan, an increase of 3.48 million yuan over the end of the first quarter.

The banking departments in Jilin Province publicized the benefits of participating in savings to the masses, both for national construction and for themselves. At the same time, they improved service work, simplified deposit and withdrawal procedures, and facilitated depositors. At present, there are 289 bank savings offices in the province, and various units have established agency offices, with more than 10,000 savings agents and assistant savings agents assisting banks in handling savings business. Due to the widespread establishment of savings institutions, it has basically been achieved that employees do not leave their units to save, residents do not leave their streets to save, and rural residents do not leave their villages to save, which is generally convenient for the broad masses, and their enthusiasm for saving is very high.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 3rd: People in various cities and towns in Shanxi Province are actively participating in savings, accumulating funds for national construction. From January to mid-May this year, the deposits received by the People's Banks in various cities and towns have reached more than 76.2 million yuan, a net increase of 2.97 million yuan compared with the end of last year. More than 70% of employees in Taiyuan City have participated in savings, and the city's savings deposits reached more than 29.4 million yuan by the end of May, a net increase of more than 5 million yuan compared with the end of last year.

Since the beginning of this year, various organizations, groups, factories, mines, enterprises, and street residents' organizations have generally regarded mobilizing the masses to save as an important task. In order to facilitate mass savings, national banks have established more than 1,500 savings agencies and outlets in various parts of the province since the beginning of this year; the number of assistant savings agents has increased to more than 9,400.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 3rd: The Wuhan Branch of the People's Bank of China has taken various measures to facilitate the deposit and withdrawal of money for the masses. In addition to the more than 400 savings offices and agencies already established in the city, people in various streets, residents' committees, and even residents' groups are entrusted by the bank to help the masses plan their lives and carry out publicity on savings to the masses. In residential areas far from savings offices and agencies, the bank has set up service stations, with activists in the residents acting as agents for savings business. Bank staff also often step out of the counter to collect and pay on-site. This method is especially popular among the masses on construction sites. The staff of the Wugang construction site savings office conduct savings business on the construction site every day, rain or shine. In the past two or three months, the average monthly employee deposits have increased by more than 350,000 yuan compared with the past.

The amount of savings in Wuhan City has also been increasing month by month. According to bank statistics, as of mid-May, the city's savings amount has increased by more than 15% compared with the end of last year. (Attached picture)

    山东吉林山西武汉人民积极储蓄
    据新华社济南3日电　山东省广大农民踊跃参加储蓄，农村储蓄额上升。据不完全统计，全省到5月中旬止，农村储蓄额已达一亿六千七百万元，比去年同期增长75.5％。
    山东省各地人民银行和信用社干部，利用各种形式广泛向社员宣传了节约储蓄的意义。他们为了使群众存款取款方便，常常流动到社员家庭去办理储蓄业务，并且帮助社员安排生活，制订节约储蓄计划。高唐县梁村公社李楼、于庄、孙庄三个村的社员听到宣传后，在领取工资的一两天内就有一百一十四户参加储蓄。蒙阴县孟良崮人民公社高庄管理区，是一个贫瘠山区，过去社员没有储蓄习惯，经过党组织和银行、信用社干部的宣传，精打细算地安排开支，二十七天的时间即向银行存款四千二百五十元，存款户占农户总数的85％。
    据新华社长春3日电吉林省广大人民最近踊跃参加储蓄。据人民银行吉林省分行到5月20日统计，全省储蓄存款已达七千八百二十七万元，比第一季度末增加三百四十八万元。
    吉林省银行部门向群众宣传了参加储蓄，对国家建设和对自己的好处，同时改进服务工作，简化存款取款手续，便利储户。现在全省已有银行储蓄所二百八十九个，各单位建立了代办所，有一万多个储蓄代办员和协储员协助银行办理储蓄业务。由于储蓄机构普遍建立，基本上做到了职工储蓄不出本单位，居民储蓄不出街道，农村储蓄不出屯，广大群众普遍称便，储蓄热情很高。
    据新华社太原3日电山西省各城镇人民群众踊跃参加储蓄，为国家建设积累资金。今年1月到5月中旬，各城镇人民银行接收的存款已达七千六百二十多万元，比去年年底净增二百九十七万元。太原市70％以上的职工参加了储蓄，全市到5月底的储蓄存款达两千九百四十多万元，比去年年底净增五百多万元。
    今年以来，各地的机关团体、厂矿企业、街道居民组织，普遍把发动群众储蓄当作一项重要工作。为了便利群众储蓄，国家银行今年以来在全省各地建立了一千五百多处储蓄代办所和代办点；协储员增加到九千四百多人。
    据新华社武汉3日电　中国人民银行武汉市分行采取多种多样措施，便利群众存取款项。全市除了已设四百多个储蓄所、代办所外，各街道、居民委员会以至居民小组都有人接受银行委托，帮助群众计划安排生活和向群众进行有关储蓄的宣传。在离开储蓄所、代办所较远的居民区，银行设立了服务站，由居民中的积极分子代办储蓄业务。银行工作人员还经常走出柜台，上门收付。这种方式在工地上特别受到群众的欢迎。武钢工地储蓄所的工作人员无论刮风下雨，每天都在工地巡回开展储蓄业务，近两三个月，职工存款平均每月比过去增长三十五万元以上。
    武汉市全市储蓄金额也逐月上升。据银行统计，到5月中旬止，全市储蓄额比去年年底增加了15％以上。（附图片）
