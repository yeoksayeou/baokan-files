    Conscientiously Organize and Research Folk Prescriptions
    Jin Wen
    The work of collecting folk prescriptions and medical techniques carried out in various regions to explore the treasure house of traditional Chinese medicine has made great progress and yielded extremely considerable results. The Ministry of Health of the Central Government recently notified the health departments and bureaus of all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions to do a good job in organizing, researching, and promoting secret and effective prescriptions. Shanghai is also actively carrying out the work of organizing and researching secret and effective prescriptions on the basis of the folk collection movement. This is very important.
    The purpose of collecting folk prescriptions and medical techniques is to expand practice, relieve people's suffering, and serve the people's health undertakings. Although these folk prescriptions and medical techniques are the accumulated experiences of the broad masses of the Chinese people in fighting against diseases, they contain both essence and dross. Today, it is necessary and possible for us to use modern scientific knowledge and methods to carry out the work of removing the crude and retaining the refined, and to conduct necessary identification. Among the thousands of folk prescriptions and medical techniques, many have been developed through repeated practice and improvement by the broad masses of the people, and they have very high efficacy for many diseases, including difficult and complicated diseases. However, some prescriptions have only been secretly passed down by a single family for generations or by a few people, and there may be inaccuracies, omissions, or even distortions. There are also some prescriptions that are not entirely scientific. Some prescriptions have little or no actual effect, and some even contain harmful superstitious elements. This situation of mixing the refined and the crude is not conducive to promotion and application. Therefore, the work of removing the crude and retaining the refined is indispensable.
    Thousands upon thousands of single prescriptions, secret prescriptions, effective prescriptions, and medical techniques have been made public and spread widely. It is natural for people to urgently demand that these prescriptions and techniques play a role, so the work of removing the crude and retaining the refined should keep up in a timely manner. However, it must also be noted that some prescriptions or medical techniques certainly have curative effects, but simply cannot be explained using existing scientific knowledge and methods. Do not hastily deny them by saying they are "unscientific." For such prescriptions or medical techniques, on the one hand, medical institutions or medical science research units can test them through practice, and on the other hand, they can continue to study them with modern scientific knowledge and methods to gain a clear understanding.
    Organizing and researching the vast sea of folk prescriptions and medical techniques is the common glorious task of traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine. It is hoped that traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine will fully cooperate, give full play to their strengths, and excellently complete the task of exploring the treasure house of traditional Chinese medicine.

    认真整理研究民间药方
    金文
    各地为发掘祖国医药宝库而开展的收集民间药方和医疗技术的采风工作，进展很大，收获极为可观。中央卫生部最近通知各省、市、自治区卫生厅、局要作好整理研究推广秘方验方的工作；上海还在采风运动的基础上，积极开展秘方验方的整理研究工作。这是很重要的。
    收集民间药方和医疗技术的目的，是为了扩大实践，解除人民的病痛，为人民的保健事业服务。这些民间药方和医疗技术虽然是我国广大人民与疾病作斗争的经验积累，其中有精华，也有糟粕。今天，我们有必要而且有可能应用现代科学的知识和方法，进行去粗取精的工作，加以整理研究，作必要的鉴定。在那成千累万的来自民间的药方和医疗技术中，有不少是曾经经过广大人民反复实践和提高而发展起来的，它们对于很多疾病，包括疑难病症，都有很高的疗效。而有的药方，却只经过单家独户的几代秘传或少数人秘传，可能有失实或错漏、甚至以讹传讹。还有某些药方有不尽科学之处。有的药方实际疗效很小或者没有疗效，甚至有的还夹杂了某些有害的迷信成分。这样精粗混存的情况，不利于推广应用。所以，去粗取精的工作少不得。
    成千累万的单方、秘方、验方和医疗技术都公开了，流传开了。人们迫切要求这些药方和技术发挥作用，这是自然的，所以去粗取精的工作应该及时跟上去。但是也必须注意到，有的药方或医疗技术肯定有疗效，只是因为应用现有的科学知识和方法还不能加以说明，不要就说它“不科学”而断然加以否定。对这种药方或医疗技术，一方面可以由医疗机关或医学科学研究单位通过实践加以考验，另方面也可以应用现代科学的知识和方法继续钻研，求得清楚了解。
    对浩如烟海的民间药方和医疗技术进行整理研究，是中医和西医共同的光荣任务，希望中西医充分合作，各抒所长，出色地完成发掘祖国医药宝库的任务。
