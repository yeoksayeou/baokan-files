    "Nursing Station" in the Pigsty
    Recently, a special pigsty appeared in the Baiyan First Pig Farm of Changping Commune in Fenghuang County, Hunan Province. On top of this pigsty, another layer of planks was added, and the four sides were lined with wooden boards, forming a rectangle. From a distance, you couldn't tell what it was, but upon closer inspection, you realized it was a bed. This is the specially made "nursing station" of Tian Maoyun, a young pig farmer, to take care of the sow giving birth at night and ensure that every piglet survives and is healthy.
    Speaking of Tian Maoyun, he is well-known among the pig farmers in the entire commune. Although he is not in good health and is very thin, his spirit of selfless labor, love for the pig-raising business, and serious responsibility have been praised by the commune Party committee and he was rated as a first-class model pig farmer.
    Not long ago, an accident occurred at the farm. One night, during a torrential rain, a sow crushed two newborn piglets to death, and a wildcat also killed a piglet. This incident made Xiao Tian very sad, and he blamed himself for his temporary negligence. He thought to himself, "The commune entrusted me with raising so many pigs, which is a sign of their trust in me. If I don't raise them well, I'll be letting everyone down." In order to prevent the same accident from happening again, he first carefully checked the mating records and found that in addition to nine sows that were already nursing piglets and eleven that had just been mated, the remaining ten or so sows were more than eighty days pregnant and would soon give birth. Xiao Tian could roughly calculate which sow would give birth on which day, but he couldn't be sure whether it would be during the day or at night. Based on his experience, sows generally give birth more often at night than during the day, so he had to prepare for nighttime deliveries. Therefore, he created this "nursing station" and slept on it every night, waiting for the birth of the young lives.
    In the mountainous villages of May, the nights are still cold. One night, Xiao Tian came out of a meeting at the farm, and it was almost twelve o'clock. As he walked, he thought about carrying out the "Eight Goods" campaign. "Good sow breeding, good fetal survival, good enthusiasm of the breeding staff… we must achieve the 'Eight Goods' and strive to become a 'Eight Goods farm' for the whole commune." The more he thought about it, the happier he became. However, because he had been delivering piglets for several nights in a row and hadn't slept well, Xiao Tian was extremely tired, and he fell asleep as soon as he got back to bed. Not long after he fell asleep, he suddenly heard the sow panting, "Huff! Huff!" Xiao Tian was startled awake, jumped out of bed, and immediately found the sow that was about to give birth. He turned on his flashlight and began the intense work of delivering the piglets. At this time, he forgot all his fatigue and focused all his attention on staying by the sow's side. The sow had a difficult labor and gave birth very slowly. By the time the six piglets were born, the east was already turning white. When he saw a group of lively and plump piglets vying to nurse beside the sow, a happy smile appeared on his face.

### 猪栏里的“看护台”

    猪栏里的“看护台”
    在湖南凤凰县长坪公社白岩第一养猪场里，最近出现了特别的猪栏——在这一座猪栏的上面，又加上一层板，四周还用木板镶起来，形成长方形，远看不知道它是干什么的，走近一看，才知道是一个床铺。这就是青年饲养员田茂云，为了夜晚照顾母猪生崽，保证实现头头仔猪成活、健壮，而特制的“看护台”。
    提起田茂云，在全公社的饲养员当中都是很熟悉的。他虽然身体不好，很瘦弱，但他那种忘我劳动、热爱养猪事业和认真负责的精神，曾受到公社党委的表扬，并被评为甲等饲养模范。
    不久前，场里发生了一次事故。在一个倾盆大雨的夜晚，一只母猪把新生的猪崽压死两只，还被野猫咬死一只小猪。这件事使得小田十分难过，他责备自己一时疏忽。他心里想：“社里把这样多的猪交给我养，这是对我的信任，如果养不好，就对不起大伙。”为了不再发生同样事故，他首先详细地检查了配种纪录，发现除九只母猪正带崽、十一只才配种外，其余十多只母猪都怀胎八十天以上，很快就要临产了。小田大致可算出哪头母猪哪天生崽，可是究竟在白天还是晚上，不敢断定。根据他的经验，母猪生崽一般是晚上比白天的多，他不得不作晚上接生的准备。于是，他就创造了这种“看护台”，每晚都睡在上面，等待着幼小生命的降生。
    5月的山寨，夜晚仍然很冷。有一天晚上，小田从场里开会出来，已快十二点了。他边走边想着开展“八好”运动的事。“母猪饲养好、保胎成活好、饲养人员干劲好……一定能达到‘八好’，争取成为全社‘八好场’。”他越想越高兴。可是，由于这几晚上连着接生，没睡好觉，小田实在疲乏极了，回来倒在床上就睡了。当他刚睡着不久，忽然传来母猪“呼哧！呼哧！”的喘气声。小田被惊醒了，一翻身跳下床来，立即找到了那只要生产的母猪。他打起手电筒，就开始了紧张的接生工作。这时，他忘记了一切疲劳，聚精会神地守候在母猪的身旁。母猪难产，生得很慢，等到六只小猪生完，已经东方发白了。当他看到一群活泼肥胖的猪崽，在母猪身边争着吃奶的时候，脸上出现了愉快的笑容。
