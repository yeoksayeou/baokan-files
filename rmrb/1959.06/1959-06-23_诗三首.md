Three Poems
Wu Gaizhi

    Expecting Rain
    The atmosphere is low and the sky is dim,
    Stifling heat, no wind, how depressing!
    Swallows fly high, ants swarm out,
    Dry seedlings everywhere long for sweet rain.

    Night Rain
    Lightning flashes, thunder chases through midnight,
    Sudden wind and torrential rain like a tidal wave;
    Who is stirring up heaven and earth?
    Scattering sweet rain, benefiting the crops.

    After the Rain
    Early morning, the great rivers and mountains are washed clean,
    Every drop of timely rain turns into gold;
    From now on, a new world unfolds,
    Ten thousand people together praise the harvest of a thousand catties.

    诗三首
    吴溉之
    望雨低沉大气尽头昏，燥热无风闷煞人；燕子高飞群蚁出，旱苗遍地想甘霖。
    夜闻雷雨电逝雷追震午宵，骤风急雨似海潮；翻天复地谁作怪？漫撒甘霖惠禾苗。
    雨后早起大好河山一洗清，点点时雨变黄金；从此打开新天地，万民齐颂产千斤。
