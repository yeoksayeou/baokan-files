Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 15th: The Youth Production Team of the Chengjiao Commune in Yingshang County, Anhui Province, a previously low-yielding area prone to drought and flooding, achieved an average yield of 553 jin and 12 liang per mu on 1,800 mu of wheat this year. This is an increase of nearly fourfold compared to the 117 jin per mu in 1958. Among them, 120 mu of high-yield fields reached a yield of 1,053 jin per mu.

Encouraged by the bumper harvest, the members of the Youth Production Team decided to sell over 370,000 jin of surplus grain to the state, a fourfold increase compared to the same period last year. They are full of confidence in striving for an even greater harvest in the autumn.

Since last autumn, the Youth Production Team has adopted three fundamental measures to eradicate drought and flood disasters and change the face of the low-yielding area.

First, they extensively dug rivers and ditches, newly excavating two "Youth Rivers" stretching three li in length and approximately thirty meters in width, and a "Central River" six li long, creating a complete water conservancy irrigation and drainage system in the area with a river network encompassing a ditch network, a ditch network encompassing a channel network, interconnected ditches and rivers, linked channels and wells, allowing for free storage and drainage, and fearless of drought and flood. For example, last winter, they experienced sixty days of severe drought, and this May, they encountered continuous rain, but the growth of wheat was not severely affected by drought or flood.

Second, all the wheat fields in the team were transformed into raised-bed fields, changing the past habit of extensive planting with low yields. In the lakeside slope area, terraced raised-bed fields were built to conserve water and soil. The raised-bed fields also facilitated field management, playing a significant role in the large-scale wheat harvest.

Third, in accordance with the characteristics of the region, the "Eight-Character Charter" was thoroughly and meticulously implemented. All wheat fields were deep-plowed to a depth of eight to ten inches last autumn, with a base fertilizer application of 1,040 dan per mu, of which 40% was fine fertilizer. Layered fertilization was also widely carried out to improve the soil. At the same time, rational close planting was carried out according to the soil and specific conditions such as deep plowing and base fertilizer application. In terms of wheat field management, a wheat specialized team was established, and field-side manure pools and fertilizer plants were set up, with responsibility for field management assigned to different areas and groups.

    颍上城郊公社青年队征服旱涝
    小麦亩产跃增近四倍
    一千八百亩麦田平均亩产五百五十三斤多
    据新华社合肥15日电　过去易旱易涝的低产地区——安徽省颍上县的城郊公社青年生产队，今年种植的一千八百亩小麦，平均亩产五百五十三斤十二两，比1958年亩产一百一十七斤增长近四倍。其中有一百二十亩丰产田，亩产高达一千零五十三斤。
    在大丰收的鼓舞下，青年生产队的社员们决定卖给国家三十七万斤余粮，比去年同期出售的余粮增加四倍，并且信心百倍地争取秋季更大丰收。
    青年生产队从去年秋天起，采取了三条根本性的措施，根治旱涝灾害，改变低产地区面貌。
    首先大挖河道、沟渠，新挖了两条长达三里、宽约三十公尺的青年河和一条六里长的中心河，使这个地区有了一个河网套沟网、沟网套渠网、沟河相通、渠井相联、蓄泄自如，不惧旱涝的完整水利排灌系统。例如去年冬天曾有六十天遭到严重的干旱，今年5月又逢阴雨，但是小麦的生长，没有受到旱涝的严重影响。
    其次，全队麦地实现了畦田化，改变了过去广种薄收的习惯。在湖坡地带，修了梯形畦田，保持了水土。畦田又便于田间管理，对小麦大面积丰收起了很大作用。
    第三，根据地区的特点，深入细致地贯彻了“八字”宪法，所有麦地去秋都深耕八寸至一尺，每亩施基肥一千零四十担，其中40％是细肥。还普遍进行了分层施肥，改良土壤。同时根据土壤和深耕、施基肥等具体情况，进行了合理密植。在麦田管理方面，成立了小麦专业队，建立田头粪池和肥料厂，分片分组负责田间管理。
