This newspaper, Yushu, June 14th: The Daling People's Commune in Yushu County, Jilin Province, through investigation and research, and earnest consultation with the masses, eliminated the situation where some commune and team cadres were uncertain and overestimated the shortage of labor. They formulated a reliable summer hoeing labor plan and made thorough arrangements for summer hoeing production.

The autumn fields planted by the Daling People's Commune this year implemented reduced ridges and increased rows, reasonable close planting, and newly opened large areas of wasteland. The total planting area of the commune increased by 824 hectares compared to last year. In addition, this year's rainfall was timely, the planting period was short, and the seedlings emerged uniformly, greatly increasing the amount of labor required for field management in the summer. The Daling Commune Party Committee formulated a summer hoeing labor plan based on the above situation. However, there were significant discrepancies compared to the labor plans of each management area. For example, according to this plan, the field management work during the summer hoeing period, which mainly involves weeding, harrowing, thinning, and topdressing, requires an average of 33 labor days per hectare, an increase of 50% compared to the actual labor usage during the same period last year. However, the Daling Management Area believed that 80 labor days were needed per hectare; the Dalong Management Area also believed that at least 75 labor days were needed. According to this calculation, a large number of labor days would be lacking, and many cadres felt helpless.

Therefore, the secretary of the commune Party committee first went to the Dalong Management Area and convened separate forums with experienced production team leaders, commune members, and management area leading cadres to carefully study the labor needs of summer hoeing production and the ways to solve the labor shortage. The first forum was for commune members and production team leaders to calculate the amount of labor used for each type of agricultural work based on the actual labor usage of summer hoeing in the past half month, and then extrapolate the total amount of labor used for the entire summer hoeing, and calculate the amount of mobile labor for watering, pest control, transplanting seedlings, replenishing seedlings, flood prevention and other aspects. The second forum was to study the efficiency of tool reform and discuss ways to tap labor potential, and calculate the amount of labor potential. The third forum was to discuss how to manage the newly opened wasteland and the amount of labor required. After three forums, the commune Party committee discovered that the management area's own calculation of 75 labor days per hectare was too high and was not actually needed. The reason was that after the implementation of contract work and output, the enthusiasm of the masses greatly increased, and labor efficiency significantly improved; a large amount of land was deeply plowed, the soil was loose and soft, the grass was sparse, and the seedlings were strong, making it easier to weed and harrow, etc. After careful calculation, only about 40 labor days per hectare were needed to complete the plan. The forum also found that the planned improvement tools in the commune's original plan, such as the four-horse two-plow weeding machine, were not suitable for the first weeding; however, the reformed weeding hoe was very suitable, and this alone could save 6,400 labor days. The management area cadres originally estimated that installing small plows on the integrated number weeding machine could save 3,600 labor days, but after precise calculation, it could save 7,150 labor days. Regarding tapping labor potential, the original idea was to continue streamlining logistics personnel. At the forum, it was realized that the commune's logistics personnel had already been streamlined once during the spring planting, and if they were streamlined again, it would inevitably weaken the development of livelihood management and diversified operations; while the small group and small section contract work proposed by the commune members and team leaders, with quality guaranteed to the individual, could improve labor efficiency by 25% to 30%. In addition, the forum also proposed organizing auxiliary labor for sporadic contract work and implementing amateur local contract work for logistics personnel. Using these methods, the entire management area's summer hoeing labor can be completed within 50 days (10 days earlier than last year).

After investigation and research, the commune immediately convened leading cadres from each management area to promote the practices of the Dalong Management Area. According to this practice, the Daling Management Area's original plan of 80 labor days per hectare has been reduced to 34 labor days. Other management areas have also mostly revised their original labor plans, thereby making a clearer estimate of the labor shortage for this year's summer hoeing, and finding more methods to improve tools and tap labor potential. On this basis, the entire commune re-formulated the summer hoeing labor plan.

Now, the commune's summer hoeing progress is far ahead in the county, and the first weeding and harrowing task was completed at the end of May, half a month earlier than last year. The commune members said: "In previous years, summer hoeing was a case of crops overwhelming people, but this year it is a case of people overwhelming crops!"

    深入调查　摸清底细　办法落实
    榆树县大岭公社改革工具，核实用工计划，夏锄在全县领先
    本报榆树14日电　吉林省榆树县大岭人民公社，通过调查研究和认真同群众商量的办法，消除了一部分社队干部心中无数，过高估计劳动力不足的状况，制定出可靠的夏锄劳力规划，周密安排了夏锄生产。
    大岭人民公社今年播种的秋田，实行了缩垅增行，合理密植，又新开了大片荒地，全社播种面积较去年扩大了八百二十四公顷。加上今年雨水适时，播种期短，小苗齐出，夏季田间管理的劳动量大大增加。中共大岭公社党委根据上述情况制定出夏锄劳力规划。但是，同各管理区的劳力规划相比，出入很大。例如今年夏锄期间以铲地、趟地、间苗、追肥为主的田间管理工作量，根据这个规划，平均每公顷需要三十三个劳动日，比去年同期实际用工量增长50％。但大岭管理区却认为每公顷地需要八十个劳动日；大龙管理区也认为至少需要七十五个劳动日。按照这样的计算，大量劳动日都没有着落，许多干部感到束手无策。
    因此，公社党委书记首先到大龙管理区，分别召集了经验较多的生产队长、社员及管理区领导干部座谈，认真研究夏锄生产的劳力需要和解决劳力不足的办法。第一次座谈会是由社员和生产队长根据半个月来的夏锄实际用工情况，计算出每种农活的用工数量，再由此推算出整个夏锄的用工数量，并计算出浇水、治虫、移苗、补苗、防涝和其他方面的机动用工数量。第二次座谈会是研究工具改革的效率，商量挖掘劳动潜力的门路，计算劳动潜力的数量。第三次座谈会是商量新开荒地，怎样经营，用工的数量。开过三次座谈会以后，公社党委才发现：原来这个管理区自己计算每公顷需要七十五个劳动力的账打得太高了，实际用不了这么多。原因是包工包产落实以后，群众积极性大大增长，劳动效率有显著的提高；大量土地经过深翻，土质松软，草少苗壮，便于铲趟等等。经过认真的计算，每公顷土地只需要四十个劳动日左右，即可完成计划。这次座谈中还发现，公社原规划中计划的改良工具如四马二犁铲趟机等，并不适宜于头遍铲地；不过改革耘锄很适用，仅这一项就可以节省六千四百个劳动日。管理区干部原估计把综合号铲趟机装上小铧可节省三千六百个劳动日，精确计算后，可节省七千一百五十个劳动日。挖掘劳动潜力一项，原来想继续精简后勤人员。在座谈会上才想到，全公社后勤人员已在春播期间精简过一次，如再精简，势必削弱生活管理和多种经营的发展；而社员和队长们提出的小组小段包工，质量落实到人等行之有效的办法，却可以提高劳动效率25％到30％。此外，座谈会上还提出组织辅助劳力零星包工和实行后勤人员的业余近地包工等办法。运用这些办法，整个管理区夏锄劳动可以压缩在五十天内（较去年提前十天）完成。
    经过调查研究以后，公社即召集各管理区领导干部，推广大龙管理区的作法。按照这个作法，大岭管理区原来估算的每公顷土地需要八十个劳动日的规划，已降为三十四个劳动日。其他管理区也大都修整了原来的用工计划，从而对今年夏锄劳力不足的情况作出比较清醒的估计，并找到更多改良工具和挖掘劳动潜力的方法。在这个基础上，全公社重新制定了夏锄劳力规划。
    现在，这个公社的夏锄进度在全县范围内遥遥领先，头遍铲趟任务已于5月底完成，比去年提早了半月。社员们说：“往年夏锄是庄稼压人，今年是人压庄稼了！”
