    Removing Flower Petals Before Rain Can Protect Cotton Bolls

    When cotton blossoms, the corolla faces upwards and forms a cup shape, easily accumulating water during rain. After the rain, the petals close, preventing the water from draining, which easily causes the flower's core to become moldy, leading to young boll abscission.

    In 1958, the Shijiazhuang Agricultural Science Research Institute also adopted the measure of removing withered flowers in the management of cotton satellite fields. They found that when removing semi-withered corollas, there was a lot of water accumulated in the flower's core. Some flower cores had a layer of paste-like substance, already fermented. After removing these corollas, the surface of the young boll was grayish-white, indicating that it had been damaged by water immersion. Therefore, the way to prevent water accumulation in the flower core is to peel off the petals of the fresh flowers every afternoon during the rainy season, so that water will no longer accumulate during rain. Comparative experiments showed that removing fresh flower petals before rain reduced abscission by 8.8% compared to removing withered flowers after rain.

    雨前剥花能保铃
    棉花花冠上仰，开花时成盏状，遇雨容易存水；雨后花瓣闭合，积水排泄不出，花心极易发霉，因而招致幼铃脱落。
    1958年石家庄农业科学研究所在棉花卫星田的管理上，雨季也采取了摘败花的措施。他们发现摘除半枯萎的花冠时，花心积水很多；有的花心中有一层糊状物，已经发酵，这种花冠，摘除后幼铃表皮呈灰白色，表明已受水浸的损害。因此防止花心积水的办法是在雨季每日下午剥去鲜花的花瓣，这样遇雨就不再存水。经对比试验，雨前剥鲜花，较雨后摘败花可减少脱落8.8％。
