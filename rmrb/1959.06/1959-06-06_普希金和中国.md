Pushkin and China
Ge Baoquan

The name of the great Russian poet Pushkin is very familiar to our vast Chinese readership, and his immortal works are among the most beloved. As early as the twenty-ninth year of the reign of Emperor Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty (1903), his famous novel, "The Captain's Daughter," was translated into Chinese, and the title was translated as "Russian Romance, The Biography of Smith and Mary, also known as Record of a Butterfly Dream." This was not only the earliest Chinese translation of Pushkin's work in our country but also the earliest Chinese translation of Russian literature in our country. Then, in 1907, Mr. Lu Xun initially discussed Pushkin's life and works in his essay "On the Power of Mara Poetry." In the recent forty years, Pushkin's poems, prose, and dramas have been translated into Chinese one after another, and they have been widely circulated among our readers. In 1937, our country commemorated the centenary of Pushkin's death, and in 1949, our country commemorated the 150th anniversary of his birth. In addition, there is a bronze statue of him in Shanghai. Because of this, Pushkin, this great poet, seems even more incomparably dear to us!

Over the years, in the process of translating and studying Pushkin's works, I have discovered some historical materials proving Pushkin's connection with China. In May 1956, in Leningrad, I had the opportunity to visit the Institute of Russian Literature of the Soviet Academy of Sciences (also known as "Pushkin House"), meet with famous Soviet Pushkin scholars Tomashevsky and Alekseev, study Pushkin's manuscripts, and browse Pushkin's private collection of books. Through some new historical materials collected at that time, it can be seen that Pushkin had a great interest in China throughout his life.

Pushkin was born in Moscow in 1799. At the age of twelve, he went to St. Petersburg with his uncle and entered the newly built Tsarskoye Selo Lyceum. The then-popular French "China craze" had long been transmitted to St. Petersburg. For example, in the middle of the eighteenth century, the Chinese Palace was built in Oranienbaum near St. Petersburg, and then the Chinese Theater and pavilions were built in the Summer Palace of Tsarskoye Selo. Pushkin knew about China from these buildings since childhood, so it is not surprising that he wrote such lines in his first epic poem "Ruslan and Ludmila": "The light breeze of May brings coolness, in the shade of the fluttering woods, the Chinese nightingale sings."

In 1820, Pushkin was exiled to southern Russia by Tsar Alexander I for writing poems such as "Ode to Freedom" and "To Chaadaev." He lived in Kishinev and Odessa successively and began writing the novel in verse "Eugene Onegin." During his exile in South Russia, Pushkin met Vigel. Vigel accompanied Count Golovkin, the Russian envoy, to China in 1805, and Pushkin learned something about China from him. When Pushkin was writing the first chapter of "Onegin," he wrote the sentence, "The Chinese sage Confucius teaches us to respect young people..." We can still see these lines in the lower-left corner of page 6 of Pushkin's manuscript No. 2369, but these lines were crossed out by Pushkin and were not included in his final draft.

In 1826, Pushkin was pardoned by Tsar Nicholas I and moved to Moscow. In 1828, Pushkin met Father Yakinf Bichurin, a famous Chinese scholar (Sinologist) at the time, and established a close friendship. Father Bichurin had served as the head of the Russian Orthodox Church Mission in China and lived in Beijing for fourteen years (from 1807 to 1821). He was proficient in Chinese and translated and wrote many works about China, which he gave to Pushkin. For example, his Russian translation of the "Three Character Classic" is still kept in Pushkin's private collection. From his interactions with Father Bichurin, Pushkin learned more about China and was filled with longing for China. We know that at this time, although Pushkin had been pardoned by the Tsar, he was actually still living under the Tsar's surveillance. He had repeatedly tried to escape abroad, but all failed. So at this time, he had the idea of visiting China. As he wrote in a poem in 1829:

"Let's go together, I'm ready;
Friend, wherever you go,
Wherever you want to go, I will follow
You go,…………
Even to the Great Wall of China in distant China."

Then, on January 7, 1830, Pushkin wrote a letter in French to General Benkendorf, the then Chief of Gendarmes, requesting permission to accompany the Russian mission to China: "I am currently unmarried and not involved in official positions. I would like to travel to France or Italy. If this request is not granted, then I request permission to visit China with the mission to China." On January 17, Benkendorf replied to Pushkin's letter, needless to say, refusing Pushkin's request. Pushkin's idea of visiting China finally became a bubble. A few years later, in 1837, Pushkin died of serious injuries from a duel, becoming a victim of Tsarist autocratic rule. It is a pity that Pushkin failed to visit China, otherwise, there would be many poems about China in his literary heritage. In Pushkin's private collection, several books about China are still preserved today, which also shows his interest in China.

The era in which Pushkin lived and created is more than a century away from us, but his works still stir our hearts. Especially when we know how Pushkin developed a great interest in China during his life, we feel that Pushkin is even more dear to us. Pushkin once said that the poet's vocation is to "burn people's hearts with language." May his immortal verses always burn in our hearts and ignite our souls! (Attached Image)

    普希金和中国
    戈宝权
    伟大的俄罗斯诗人普希金的名字，是我们中国广大的读者非常熟悉的，他的不朽的作品也是最为我们所喜爱的。我国远在清光绪二十九年（1903年），就已经翻译了他的著名的长篇小说：“上尉的女儿”，当时这本书的题名被译为“俄国情史，斯密士玛利传，一名花心蝶梦录”。这不仅是普希金的作品在我国最早的中译，同时也是俄国文学作品在我国最早的中译。接着在1907年，鲁迅先生最初在“摩罗诗力说”一文中论述了普希金的生平和作品。在最近的四十多年当中，普希金的诗歌、散文和戏剧作品，差不多又都先后被译成中文，在我国的读者当中广泛地流传着。1937年，我国纪念了普希金逝世一百周年的忌辰，1949年，我国又纪念了他一百五十周年的诞辰。除此之外，在上海还建有他的铜像。正因为这样，普希金这位伟大的诗人，对于我们就显得更加无比的亲切！
    多年来，在翻译和研究普希金的作品的过程当中，我曾发现了一些证明普希金和中国有关的史料。1956年5月在列宁格勒时，我曾有机会访问了苏联科学院的俄罗斯文学研究所（又名“普希金之家”），会见了苏联著名的普希金学者托玛谢夫斯基和阿列克塞耶夫等人，研究了普希金的手稿，浏览了普希金的私人藏书。通过当时所收集到的一些新的史料可以看出，普希金在自己的一生当中，对中国是有着很大的兴趣的。
    普希金于1799年生在莫斯科，十二岁就随着伯父前往彼得堡，考进了新建的沙皇村中学。当时法国流行的“中国狂热”，早已传到了彼得堡。像在十八世纪的中叶，彼得堡附近的奥朗宁堡就建造了中国宫，接着在沙皇村的夏宫也建造了中国戏院和楼台亭阁等。普希金从童年时起通过这些建筑物就知道了中国，难怪他在自己的第一部长诗
  “鲁斯兰和柳德米拉”当中写出了这样的诗句：“五月的轻风吹来了凉爽，在飘动的树林的阴影里，中国的夜莺在歌唱。”
    1820年，普希金因为写作“自由颂”和“致察尔达耶夫”等诗，被沙皇亚历山大一世放逐到俄国南方去。他先后在基希?夫和敖德萨两地住过，并开始写作长篇诗体小说“叶甫盖尼·奥?金”。就在南俄流放期间，普希金和维格尔相识。维格尔曾于1805年随同俄国使臣戈洛夫金伯爵访问中国，普希金就从他那里知道了一些有关中国的情形。当普希金写作“奥?金”的第一章时，曾写过“中国的圣人孔夫子，教导我们敬爱青年人………”的句子。我们现在从普希金手稿的第2369本第6面的左下角，还可以看到这几句诗，但这几句诗被普希金用笔划掉，并未收进他的最后定稿。
    1826年普希金得到沙皇尼古拉一世的赦免，迁居到莫斯科。就在1828年，普希金和当时著名的中国学者（汉学家）雅金夫·毕丘林神父相识，并且建下了亲密的友谊。毕丘林神父曾任过俄国东正教会驻中国使团的团长，在北京前后住过十四年之久（从1807年到1821年），精通中国语文，翻译过和撰写过不少有关中国的著作，他曾将这些著作送给普希金。像他用俄文翻译的
  “三字经”，一直到现在还收藏在普希金的私人藏书中。普希金从和毕丘林神父的交往中，知道了更多的有关中国的情形，而且对中国充满了向往之情。我们知道这时候普希金虽然得到了沙皇的赦免，但实际上还是生活在沙皇的监视之下，他曾多次想逃亡到国外去，但均未成功。于是这时候，他就有了想访问中国的念头。像他在1829年写的一首诗中，就有这样的句子：
    “我们一同走吧，我准备好啦；
    朋友，无论你到那里，
    只要是你想去的地方，我都跟
    随着你去，…………
    那怕是去到遥远的中国的万里
    长城边。”
    接着在1830年的1月7日，普希金就用法文写了一封信给当时的宪兵总督班肯多夫将军，请求允许他跟俄国的使团同往中国：“目前我还没有结婚，也没有参加官职，我很想能到法国或是意大利去旅行。假如这个请求得不到许可，那么我请求能允许我随同到中国去的使团一同访问中国。”1月17日，班肯多夫复了普希金的信，不用说，是拒绝了普希金的请求。普希金访问中国的念头，从此终于成为泡影。再过了几年即1837年，普希金即因决斗重伤死亡，成为沙皇专制统治的牺牲品。惋惜的，是普希金未能访问中国，否则在他的文学遗产中，当会有不少关于中国的诗章。在普希金的私人藏书中，直到今天还保存着好几种有关中国的书籍，从此也可以看出他对中国的兴趣。
    普希金生活和创作的时代，距离我们已是一个多世纪了，但是他的作品依然还激动着我们的心情。尤其是当我们知道普希金的一生当中怎样对中国发生极大的兴趣，我们会觉得普希金对我们是更为亲切。普希金曾经说过，诗人的天职，是要“用语言去把人们的心灵烧亮”。愿他的不朽的诗句，经常在燃烧我们的心，也把我们的心灵烧亮！（附图片）
