    Economic Curiosities
    The Guest Outshines the Host
    An odd thing happened at a newly built rice mill in Shanghai: The value of the rice husks surpassed that of the rice!
    In the past, the rice husks produced by this mill were sold to farmers at 1.5 cents per 100 jin to feed pigs. Earlier this year, they built five open-air furnaces and used a combination of indigenous and modern methods to extract rice husk dry distillation liquid. This is a chemical mixture containing high-grade phenol oil for treating lung diseases, as well as industrial methanol, acetic acid, sodium acetate, white carbon black, and so on.
    The rice husk ash after dry distillation is also very useful. Activated carbon can be extracted from it. This is an important chemical raw material that can be used to make dyes and in the metallurgical industry. After being processed in this way several times, the value of rice husks increases a hundredfold. One ton of rice husks can yield 300 kilograms of dry distillation liquid and 100 kilograms of activated carbon, worth more than 400 yuan, which is more expensive than one ton of high-quality white rice!
    Wood Surpasses Steel
    Before May Day, a beautiful tugboat was launched in the Huangpu River. It is called "May Day" and has 90 horsepower, capable of towing 1,200 tons of cargo. The bottom and hull of this tugboat are not made of steel plates, but of plywood manufactured by the Shanghai Timber Factory No. 1.
    Using plywood instead of steel plates to build ships saves steel, reduces the weight of the hull itself, results in a shallower draft, and increases the load capacity. Furthermore, it has strong corrosion resistance. It is truly both economical and practical.
    Recently, Shanghai Timber Factory No. 1 has also trial-produced a high-grade laminated board. This board is also called modified wood. It is made of several layers of wood veneer pressed together, and its wear resistance is comparable to that of steel, with even better insulation properties. It can be used to make machine gears and bearings. The Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant used this laminated board to make rolling mill bearings, and its wear resistance was more than 120 times higher than that of the original steel bearings.
    "Turning Mud into Gold"
    In most people's minds, gold and silver are only produced in gold and silver mines. However, the Shanghai Waste Products Company's Metal Refining Plant has extracted silver from "water."
    This water is the waste fixer solution from photography studios and hospital X-ray rooms. This liquid contains silver bromide washed from the photosensitive part of the film, and the plant uses indigenous methods to extract silver from it. Generally, one gallon of waste fixer solution from a photography studio can extract four qian of silver, and one gallon of waste fixer solution from a hospital X-ray room can extract eight qian of silver. According to preliminary estimates, the waste fixer solution in Shanghai can extract 20,000 taels of silver per year. Moreover, after the silver has been extracted, the fixer solution can be reused for developing film by adding a small amount of chemical components.
    The Shanghai Smelting Plant can also extract gold from "mud." The sludge from the copper smelting workshop of this factory contains a large amount of rare metals, which were previously discarded as garbage. This year, the factory built a "Gold and Silver Workshop" specifically using garbage mud as raw material. For gold alone, it will be able to extract more than 24,000 taels this year. This can truly be called "turning mud into gold"!
    One Bone, Seven Uses
    After eating meat, throwing the bones to the dog to gnaw—that's considered putting them to use.
    In fact, there is a lot of value in a bone. Now, the Dachang Animal Bone Processing Plant of the Shanghai Waste Products Company has achieved seven uses from one bone. After a bone enters the factory, it is first placed in a pot to boil bone oil. Bone oil can be used to make soap, engine oil, and petroleum jelly; it can also be used to extract chemical raw materials such as glycerin and fatty acids. The bones after oil extraction can be ground into bone meal, which becomes fertilizer for crops. They can also be used to manufacture bone charcoal, superphosphate, granular fertilizer, and soil fertilizer. Recently, they have also used dilute hydrochloric acid decomposition to extract the phosphorus and calcium from the bones, turning a hard bone into a crystal clear, soft bone. This is "bone element," which is a raw material for manufacturing film.
    Descending from the Sky
    The raw material for making anti-inflammatory tablets and fattening pig tablets, thiourea, used to rely on imports. But now, thiourea is "descending from the sky."
    This happened last year. The cows in a dairy farm in the suburbs of Shanghai suddenly stopped producing milk. What was the reason?
    It turned out that there was a China Dye Factory No. 3 next to the dairy farm, and the waste gas emitted by this factory in the process of manufacturing sodium nitrite and sulfurized blue was very toxic. After the cows smelled this waste gas, they would not produce milk; and the waste gas from manufacturing sulfurized blue was even more toxic, even the sparrows flying in the sky would faint and fall down after smelling it.
    Where there is poison, there is use. The factory workers used their brains to collect the waste gas from the sky. The waste gas of sodium nitrite was still made into sodium nitrite, and the waste gas of sulfurized blue was made into thiourea. This is an important raw material for making anti-inflammatory tablets and fattening pig tablets. Now the factory produces eight tons per month, specifically supplying Shanghai pharmaceutical factories.

    经济珍闻
    喧宾夺主
    上海建成米厂出了奇事：砻糠的价值比米的价值还高！
    这个厂碾米碾出的砻糠，过去都是以一角五分一百斤卖给农民喂猪。今年初，他们在露天打起五只炉子，用土洋结合办法提炼出了砻糠干馏液。这是一种化学混合液，内含治疗肺病的高级酚油和工业用的甲醇、醋酸、醋酸钠、白炭黑等等。
    砻糠经过干馏以后的砻糠灰，也大有用处。从中可以提取活性炭。这是一种重要化学原料，可用于做染料，也可以用在冶金工业上。经过这样三番两次处理，砻糠便身价百倍了。一吨砻糠可以提出三百公斤干馏液，一百公斤活性炭，价值四百多元，比一吨上白粳还贵！
    木材胜钢铁
    “五一”前夕，在黄浦江里一艘漂亮的拖轮下水了。它叫“五一”号，有九十匹马力，能拖动一千二百吨货物。这艘拖轮的船底和船壳不是用钢板制造的，而是上海木材一厂用胶合板制造的。
    用胶合板代替钢板造船，一来节约钢材，二来船体自身重量少，吃水浅，载重量大，第三还具有很强的防蚀性。真是既经济又实用。
    最近，上海木材一厂又试制成一种高级层压板。这种板又叫做变性木材，它是由几层木片压制成的，耐磨程度和钢材不相上下，绝缘性更好，可以造机器齿轮、轴承。上海第一钢铁厂用这种层压板做轧钢机轴承，比原来钢制轴承的耐磨程度要高一百二十多倍。
    “点泥成金”
    在一般人的印象里，黄金、白银只出产在金银矿。可是上海废品公司金属提炼厂却从“水”里炼出了白银。
    这种水是照像馆、医院X光室里洗过底片的废水，叫废定影液。这种液体里有从胶片感光部分洗下来的溴化银，这个厂就是用土法从中提炼白银的。一般照相馆的废定影液一加仑可以提取白银四钱，医院X光室的废定影液一加仑可以提取白银八钱。据初步计算，全上海一年的废定影液可以提炼白银两万两。而提过白银以后的定影液，略加少许化学成分，还可以再拿去冲洗胶片。
    上海冶炼厂还能够从“泥”里提金。这家工厂的炼铜车间的下脚泥里，含有大量稀有金属，过去都当成垃圾扔掉。今年这个厂建了一个“金银车间”，专用垃圾泥做原料，单黄金一项，今年就能够提炼二万四千多两。这真可谓“点泥成金”！
    一骨七用
    吃完了肉，把骨头扔给狗啃——这算派了用场。
    其实，一根骨头，油水很大。现在，上海废品公司大场牲骨加工厂，已经做到一骨七用。一根骨头进了厂以后，先是放在锅里熬骨油。骨油可造肥皂、机油、凡士林；也可以提炼甘油和脂肪酸等化工原料。熬油后的骨头可以碾制成骨粉，成为农作物的肥料。还可以制造骨炭、过磷酸钙、颗粒肥料和土化肥等。最近，他们又用稀盐酸分解法排出了骨头里的磷钙质，使一根硬棒棒的骨头，变成了晶莹透明的软骨。这是“骨素”，是制造电影胶片的原料。
    自天而降
    制造消炎片、肥猪片的原料硫脲，过去一直依靠进口。可是现在，硫脲却“从天而降”了。
    这事发生在去年。上海郊外一家奶牛场的奶牛，忽然不出奶了。甚么原因呢？
    原来，奶牛场旁边有一个中国染料三厂，这个厂制造亚硝酸钠和硫化蓝过程中冒出的废气很毒。奶牛闻到这种废气以后，不会生奶；而制造硫化蓝的废气更毒，连天上飞的麻雀闻到它也会昏死掉下。
    有毒就有用。这个厂的职工动脑筋把废气从天上收回来，亚硝酸钠的废气仍旧做成亚硝酸钠，硫化蓝的废气则制成了硫脲。这是制消炎片和肥猪片的重要原料。现在这个厂月产八吨，专门供应上海药厂。
