Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, June 8th. The Second Session of the Third Shanghai Municipal People's Congress concluded on the 6th after ten days of enthusiastic discussion. The meeting approved the work report of the Municipal People's Committee, the report on Shanghai's 1958 final accounts and the 1959 budget draft, and formulated Shanghai's 1959 national economic leap forward plan. On the closing day of the meeting, Ke Qingshi, First Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and Mayor of Shanghai, made a summary speech. He talked about the great achievements of Shanghai in the ten years since liberation, the current tasks, and the beautiful prospects for the future. He called on the people of the city to unite, exert great effort, strive for progress, and extensively and deeply develop the movement to increase production and practice economy, and to strive to fulfill and overfulfill this year's great leap forward plan. His report greatly encouraged the delegates present.

The meeting was held on the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the liberation of Shanghai. After ten years of transformation and construction, Shanghai has undergone earth-shaking and unprecedented changes in politics, economy, culture, education, and the people's lives and spiritual outlook. Last year, the city's total industrial output value, excluding the eleven suburban counties, reached 17.13 billion yuan, an increase of 50.2% over 1957, 185.8% over 1952, and 453.5% over 1949, the initial year of liberation. Last year's steel production reached 1.22 million tons, an increase of 139.5% over 1957. The average daily steel production in the fourth quarter of last year was 500 tons more than the highest annual output before liberation. While industrial production has been leaping forward, agricultural production has also increased significantly. Grain and cotton production in the four suburban counties of Shanghai and Jiading doubled compared to 1957, achieving ahead of schedule and exceeding the targets set in the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft). The people's material and cultural life has been greatly improved, and the people's socialist and communist consciousness has also been greatly enhanced.

Cao Diqiu, Deputy Mayor of Shanghai, delivered a work report at the meeting, proposing Shanghai's 1959 national economic leap forward plan to the people of the city. According to this plan, Shanghai's total industrial output value in 1959 will increase by 45% compared to last year. After the implementation of this plan, the proportion of Shanghai's heavy industry output value in the total industrial output value will increase from 45.6% in 1958 to about 50%, and the light textile industry will also develop accordingly. The city's industry will also develop in the direction of advanced, precise, large-scale, and cutting-edge under the unified planning and arrangement of the state. Cao Diqiu emphasized that Shanghai is one of China's important industrial bases, and fulfilling the national plan is the highest interest of the Shanghai people and the glorious responsibility that the Shanghai people should fulfill.

In order to complete this plan, Cao Diqiu requested in his report that the people of the city immediately mobilize, exert greater efforts to fully exert their subjective initiative, and wage a resolute struggle against all difficulties; immediately merge all forms of socialist labor competition in various fields into a magnificent and vigorous mass movement to increase production and practice economy; vigorously improve labor productivity, increase production, improve quality, practice strict economy, and oppose waste through technological innovation and other effective measures.

During the meeting, representatives from all fronts and all strata of the city spoke freely about the great achievements and experiences in various aspects of Shanghai since the Great Leap Forward last year, based on their personal experiences and feelings. They contrasted the changes in the old and new Shanghai over the past ten years with extremely vivid facts. They are determined to further implement the Party's general line for socialist construction under the leadership of the Party, carry out a city-wide mass movement to increase production and practice economy, and strive to greet the 10th anniversary of the founding of the great motherland with new and brilliant achievements.

    为了完成这个计划，曹荻秋在报告中要求全市人民立即动员起来，更加鼓足干劲以充分发挥主观能动作用，与一切困难作坚决斗争；立即把各方面的各种形式的社会主义劳动竞赛，汇合成为一个波澜壮阔、轰轰烈烈的全民性的增产节约运动；通过技术革新和其它有效措施，大力提高劳动生产率，增加生产，提高质量，厉行节约，反对浪费。
