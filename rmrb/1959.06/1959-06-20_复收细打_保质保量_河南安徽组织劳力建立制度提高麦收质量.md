Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, June 19th. Henan Province's more than 70 million mu of wheat has been basically harvested, and various regions are seizing the time to carry out a concentrated threshing effort. Most areas have completed about half of the threshing.

During the wheat threshing period, it is also the busy season for summer planting. In order to ensure that threshing and summer planting are not delayed, most areas have arranged 20% of the labor force to specialize in threshing, establishing professional threshing teams and promoting rapid threshing methods, achieving simultaneous spreading, rolling, winnowing, drying, and storage. Many areas have adopted the method of rushing to plant during the day and threshing in the early morning and evening, grasping both planting and threshing. In order to ensure the quality of threshing and threshing, many areas have also organized threshing inspection teams to check as they go, and some areas have specially summarized and promoted advanced threshing experience among the masses, so that threshing is done quickly and well.

Because this year's wheat grows particularly well, it is difficult to estimate yield by sight. Therefore, after threshing, most areas generally find that the actual yield is higher than the estimated yield. According to typical surveys conducted by Kaifeng, Xuchang, Xinxiang and other regions in various types of areas through actual harvesting and threshing, the actual yield is generally 15% to 20% higher than the estimated yield. The Gaozhuang Brigade of the Dazhaoying Commune in Xinxiang County threshed 90 mu of wheat, and the average actual yield per mu was more than 25% higher than the original estimated yield. Many old farmers reflected after threshing: Due to the further implementation of the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture, this year's wheat grains are particularly full and heavy, and it is impossible to estimate the yield with old eyes.

This newspaper, Hefei, June 19th. Anhui Province has completed the harvest of more than 30 million mu of wheat, and the threshing work has been completed more than half. In order to ensure that the fruits of the harvest are returned to the granary, the people's communes are carrying out re-collection and fine threshing.

Anhui Province's wheat grew well this year, and the summer harvest task is very heavy. In order to ensure careful harvesting and fine threshing and timely completion of summer planting, during the harvesting and threshing period, many communes divided labor and livestock into two teams, setting time, work points, and quality standards to ensure that threshing and summer planting are not delayed. Many communes have also established an inspection and acceptance system, inspecting each threshing field, and immediately organizing re-threshing for those that have not been threshed cleanly. Zhao Ji Township in Yingshang County put forward the slogan of "not missing a stalk when cutting, not dropping a grain when transporting, threshing thoroughly, winnowing cleanly, no grains left in the chaff, clean ground and roads, and every grain returned to the granary," which played a good role in ensuring the quality of harvesting and threshing.

This year, some cadres and the masses saw that the wheat was very good and had a complacent attitude of "it doesn't matter if it is not threshed cleanly." All people's communes have widely carried out ideological education on returning every grain home by carefully calculating accounts, and have implemented a special responsibility system to ensure careful harvesting and fine threshing. After discovering the phenomenon of wheat loss, the Wangshi People's Commune Party Committee in Fuyang County calculated a detailed account: If calculated at six jin of wheat lost per mu, the entire commune's 110,000 mu of wheat land would yield 660,000 jin less; if so much wheat were picked up, it could be sold for 59,400 yuan, which could buy back 600 head of cattle, averaging one more head of cattle for each production team and production group in the commune. Through the method of carefully calculating accounts, the complacent attitude of some cadres and the masses was criticized, and the task of re-collecting wheat was redeployed. The whole commune organized more than 9,000 children who picked up more than 500,000 jin of wheat (including stalks and ears) in three days. Under the slogan of "not losing a grain of food, not scattering a blade of grass," the Suncun Commune in Guoyang County mobilized 18,600 people, including the elderly, women, and children, on June 10, adopting the method of "contracting land plots according to labor force and issuing work points according to the number of wheat picked up," and picked up 464,860 jin of wheat in one day. Shishun Township mobilized 13,200 people and divided them into 187 special summer harvest and re-threshing teams, and picked up a total of 223,476 jin of wheat on the 9th.

Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, June 19th. Rongfeng County in Yunnan Province mobilized the masses to inspect all stored grain and carry out turning and airing to ensure the safety of stored grain through the rainy season.

The Rongfeng County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China recently inspected the county's grain management work and found that some stored grain was heating up and had insect infestations. In order to prevent undue losses to state grain, the county party committee immediately mobilized the masses to conduct a major inspection of all stored grain, turning, airing, and treating with medicine while inspecting. The secretary of the county party committee in charge of finance and economics, the minister of finance and trade, the deputy county magistrate, the director of the grain bureau, some cadres of the grain bureau, and more than 200 cadres from all grain management stations in the county participated in this work. After half a month of concentrated effort, the temperature and moisture content of the six million jin of grain that originally had high and semi-high heat in the county have been greatly reduced, making it safe grain.

In order to consolidate this result, the county is currently digging ditches and draining water around warehouses, improving ventilation, and establishing an inspection system of small inspections every three days and large inspections every five days to further strengthen management.

### 复收细打  保质保量  河南安徽组织劳力建立制度提高麦收质量

    河南安徽组织劳力建立制度提高麦收质量
    新华社郑州19日电　河南省的七千多万亩小麦已经基本割完，各地正抓紧时间突击打场。大部分地区已打完一半左右。
    小麦打场期间，正是夏种大忙时期。为了作到打场、夏种两不误，各地一般都安排20％的劳力专门负责打场，建立打场专业队，推行快速打场法，做到边摊、边碾、边扬、边晒、边入仓。不少地区采取了白天抢种，早晚打场的办法，一手抓种，一手抓打。为了保证打场，脱粒的质量好，很多地区还组织了打场检查组，随打随检查，有的地区特别总结推广了群众中先进的打场经验，使打场打得又快又好。
    由于今年小麦长得特别好，很难凭眼力估产，因此各地在打场以后，一般都是实产高于估产。据开封、许昌、新乡等专区在各种不同类型地区进行实收实打的典型调查，一般实产都要高于估产15％到20％。新乡县大召营公社高庄大队实打小麦九十亩，平均每亩实产量比原来估产高25％以上。不少老农在打场以后反映：由于进一步贯彻了农业“八字宪法”，今年小麦籽粒特别饱满，分量重，用老眼光估产是不行了。
    本报合肥19日电　安徽省三千多万亩小麦全部收割完毕，脱粒工作已完成一半以上。为了确保丰收果实粒粒归仓，各地人民公社正开展复收细打。
    安徽省今年的小麦长得好，夏收任务很大。为了保证精收细打和适时完成夏种工作，在收割和脱粒期中，很多公社把劳畜力分成两套班子，定时间、定工分、定质量，保证脱粒和夏种两不误。许多公社还建立了检查验收制度，打一场验一场，未打净的就随即组织复打。颍上县赵集乡就提出了“割不漏棵，运不掉穗，打透扬净，糠不留粒，地光路净，粒粒归仓”的口号，对于保证收打的质量起了很好的作用。
    今年部分干部和群众看到小麦很好，存在着“打不净没有什么”的自满情绪。各人民公社都用算细账的办法，广泛开展颗粒还家的思想教育，并实行了专责制度，保证了精收细打。阜阳县王市人民公社党委发现丢麦现象后，便算了一笔细账：如按每亩丢六斤小麦计算，全社十一万亩麦地就要少收六十六万斤；如果把这样多的麦子拾起来，能卖五万九千四百元，可买回耕牛六百头，平均全社每个生产队和生产组都可增加一头耕牛。通过算细账办法，批判了部分干部和群众的自满情绪，重新部署了复收小麦的任务。全社组织了九千多个儿童，在三天中就拾回小麦（连秆带穗，下同）五十多万斤。涡阳县孙店公社在“不丢一粒粮，不撒一棵草”的口号下，6月10日发动老年、妇女、儿童等一万八千六百多人，采取“按劳力包地块，按拾麦斤数发工分”的办法，一天就搂拾小麦四十六万四千八百六十斤。石弓乡发动一万三千二百人，分成一百八十七个夏收复打专业队，9日共拾小麦二十二万三千四百七十六斤。
    新华社昆明19日电　云南省榕峰县发动群众检查所有存粮，并进行翻仓扬晒，以确保存粮安全度过雨季。
    中共榕峰县委不久前检查了全县粮食管理工作，发现部分存粮有发热生虫等情况。为了防止国家粮食受到不应有的损失，县委立即发动群众所有存粮进行大检查，边检查，边翻仓扬晒和用药物治理。县委管财经工作的书记、财贸部长和副县长、粮食局长等，粮食局的部分干部，全县各粮食管理所的二百多个干部，都参加了这项工作。经过半个月的突击全县原来发高热和半高热的六百万斤粮食，温度、水分已大大下降，成为安全粮。
    为了巩固这个成果，目前全县正在仓库附近开沟排水，改善通风状况，并且建立三天一小查、五天一大查的检查制度，进一步加强管理。
