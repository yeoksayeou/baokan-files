    Learn to Think
    Liu Xinjié
    The ancients advocated "think thrice before acting." This seems a bit excessive, but the spirit is worth learning. Mr. Lu Xun also said something similar, stating that an article should be read at least twice after it is written. Reading it at least twice means thinking about it at least twice. If you only read without thinking, there's no point in reading it at all. If you need to read and think at least twice after writing, then the number of times you think before and during writing should be even greater.

    To write a good article, you need to think repeatedly and refine it multiple times. To handle a matter well, isn't deep consideration and repeated deliberation even more necessary?

    Objective things are complex and intricate, with surface phenomena and the essence of things. Surface phenomena are tangible, while the essence of things is internal and intangible. Therefore, what people first grasp are always those isolated, unrelated, and diverse tangible things. However, these things are unreliable. They are messy, one-sided, and a mixture of truth and falsehood. If we don't conduct serious research and analysis on these things, and don't think hard, picking up the envelope and calling it the letter, treating the one-sided as comprehensive, the part as the whole, and the phenomenon as the essence, we will only mess things up and never be able to handle them well.

    Chairman Mao said: "If people want to achieve victory in their work, that is, to achieve the expected results, they must make their thinking conform to the laws of the objective external world." How can we make our thinking conform to the laws of the objective external world? We can only think more and put in the effort of judgment and reasoning. Initially, people only see some surface phenomena of things; but after thinking, they feel there's something more inside; after thinking again, they feel there's even more inside. The more times you think, the more materials you accumulate, and the richer the content you think about. In this way, each time you think, your understanding of things deepens by a layer. After repeated thinking, you can find the internal laws of things, understand the essence of things, and thereby grasp and utilize them.

    Thinking is a mental labor. Like any labor, the greater the cultivation, the greater the harvest; the more effort you put in, the more results you get. To blossom and bear fruit here, and achieve a bountiful harvest, you need a strong will and a spirit of hard work, and you need to engage in diligent labor.

    Without thinking, any complex thing seems simple and ordinary, with nothing worth paying attention to. But after careful thought, even the simplest things can reveal underlying changes and infinite mysteries. Steam from a kettle lifts the lid – this is a very ordinary thing in our lives, and millions of people have seen it without using their brains, but Watt thought about the reasons behind it and invented the steam engine. Marx said, "The steam engine gives you a capitalist society." From an ordinary kettle that almost every household has, the whole of human society was pushed into a new century. Can we say that such things are too small, too ordinary, meaningless, and not worth thinking about?

    We also have a very famous story in China. Wang Anshi, a great scholar of the Song Dynasty, wrote a poem: "Jingkou and Guazhou are separated by a water, Zhongshan is only a few mountains away. The spring breeze has turned the south bank green, when will the bright moon shine me home?" The word "green" in the third line was revised five times. Initially, it was written as "arrive"; after thinking, he felt that "arrive" was not as good as "pass"; after thinking again, he felt that "pass" was not as precise as "enter"; after thinking again, he felt that "enter" was not as vivid as "full"; and finally, he thought of the wonderful word "green", how vivid! This shows that any insight and gain are earned with blood and sweat. The more you think, the more diligently you think, the more you can discover the essence of things and delve into the wonders of things. Those who are too lazy to use their brains, those who are not diligent in using their brains, can only submit a "blank paper" and get zero points.

    A poem can be divided into top grade, middle grade, and low grade, and a strategy (method, measure) also has top strategy, middle strategy, and low strategy. Without using your brain, there's naturally no way to write good poems or come up with good ideas. But even with using your brain, if you don't think deeply and exhaustively, and don't have Wang Anshi's spirit of "not writing a surprising line, never giving up," you also can't write top-grade poems, come up with top-grade strategies, and do your work thoroughly.

    "The more you use your brain, the more agile it becomes." The more you think, the more you can think. Because the brain is material, and like any part of the body, the more the shoulders carry, the stronger they become; the more the legs run, the more energetic they become; and the more the brain is used, the more developed it becomes. Conversely, water that doesn't flow becomes stagnant, a knife that isn't used rusts, and a brain that isn't used becomes dull. Everything in the world is the same; it always develops in motion, and once it stops, it will decline, decay, and eventually perish.

    Objective things are constantly developing, and people's understanding of objective things is also constantly developing. Therefore, thinking is endless and without limit. You have to think at this time, and you have to think at that time; you have to think today, and you have to think tomorrow. Only by constantly pondering it, studying it, and analyzing it can you improve your understanding and grasp the laws of things. Before doing things, you must "think thrice before acting," considering the role and effect of doing so, what problems may arise, and what most effective steps and methods should be taken. While doing it, you must also think as you go, correcting deviations and improving methods in a timely manner. After finishing, you must think carefully again, summarizing experiences and lessons – that is, understanding the laws of objective things.

    Because people's understanding often lags behind objective reality, we certainly cannot demand that everything be well thought out before doing it, nor can we demand that everything can only be done well and not badly. Experimental and exploratory work still needs to be done, and sometimes failure is inevitable. Perhaps the consideration beforehand is not very thorough or comprehensive, but this does not mean that work cannot be done. The important thing here is: as long as you are diligent in using your brain, working hard with your brain, and constantly thinking, thinking as you go, you can constantly modify it, enrich it, and make it increasingly perfect. Sometimes, even if it fails, it doesn't matter. "A fall into a pit, a gain in your wit." Without failure, there is no success; this is the dialectic of things. As long as we think carefully, summarize experiences and lessons, we can turn bad things into good things, and with experience next time, we won't repeat the same mistakes. What is most feared here is this kind of person: beforehand, there is neither careful consideration nor arrangement; during the process, there is no spirit of "thinking twice"; and after it's done, it's just over, without proper summary, and when it's done badly, it's not known where it went wrong. As a result, one mistake leads to another, all the way to the end, and they fall again next time!

    Thinking not only requires diligent thinking and hard thinking, but there is also a difference between skillful thinking and unskillful thinking. Skillful thinking is truly "a plan comes to mind with a furrowed brow," foreseeing the effects; unskillful thinking, after thinking and thinking, still can't jump out of the original circle. Skillful thinking doesn't mean having a special talent or the ability to predict everything. It mainly concerns the viewpoint and method of analyzing problems. That is to say, you must have a materialistic viewpoint and a dialectical method. Because: only with a materialistic viewpoint can you proceed from objective facts everywhere, respect objective things, and observe problems realistically; only by mastering the dialectical method can you deeply understand the changes of things and scientifically analyze things.

    The materialistic viewpoint is the fundamental viewpoint of Marxism for observing problems. Everyone understands the principle, but in the actual investigation of problems, some comrades still cannot fully achieve it, and sometimes they often reveal some idealistic and subjective viewpoints. The reasons for this are complex, because objective things are first reflected through people's cognition, which includes not only people's thoughts and viewpoints, but also the depth of people's understanding of things. Therefore, people always recognize objective things with more or less subjective components. To reduce or eliminate these subjective components, you must seriously transform your subjective world.

    How do you transform your subjective world? There are only two methods: one is to go deep into reality; the other is to listen more to the opinions of the masses. Going deep into reality can enable you to understand reality. Chairman Mao said: "If you want to know the taste of a pear, you must transform the pear and eat it yourself. If you want to know the organization and nature of atoms, you must carry out physics and chemistry experiments and transform the situation of atoms. If you want to know the theory and method of revolution, you must participate in the revolution. All true knowledge originates from direct experience." Without a deep understanding of reality, you can't talk about proceeding from reality, and you can't talk about observing problems realistically. Listening more to the opinions of the masses can supplement, revise, and enrich your own opinions; because the individual's experiences are always limited, only the wisdom and experience of the masses are infinite.

    The dialectical method is the fundamental method for Marxists to analyze problems, but it doesn't mean that every comrade has mastered this method. Some comrades often only see one side of the problem, without seeing the other side; they see the thing itself, without seeing the surroundings of the thing; they see the present, without seeing the past and future; they see the static, without seeing the dynamic; they see this time and this place, without seeing that time and that place... This kind of one-sided metaphysical way of thinking certainly cannot correctly think about problems, analyze things, and understand things.

    Those who have mastered scientific methods and know how to think always think about problems broadly and profoundly, are good at association, good at comparison, good at grasping characteristics, good at judging, and good at pondering. Last spring, I went to Changzhou, Jiangsu once. There is a small winery in Changzhou that used to stop work frequently due to insufficient raw materials, but one time they heard someone say that rice straw contains starch, and they thought: the raw material for making wine is mainly starch, so since rice straw contains starch, it must also be able to be used to make wine. Sure enough, after many experiments, they succeeded, and the wine tastes pure and strong. They have already put it into production.

    Recently, I read in the newspaper that a young farmer named Zhang Shougon in Changsha County, Hunan, worked more than seven hundred and ten workdays in a year. There are only three hundred and sixty-five days in a year, how can he work so many days? In addition to diligence, it is because he knows how to think. In the past, when removing manure from the ponds, one person always carried a load, but he thought: doesn't water have buoyancy? If we use a mud barge to pull it, it will be easier and less effort. After the improvement, the work efficiency increased five or six times. In the past, the round ponds were all dug in the corners of the fields, and when the manure was removed in the spring, it was sent to various places in the fields, the round trip distance was long, and labor was wasted. He thought: if we make the ponds in the middle of the field, and change the round ponds to long ponds, it would be much more convenient. Commune members transported fertilizer from the back mountain, with a small stream in the middle, and they had to take a detour. He came up with the idea of building a convenient bridge, increasing work efficiency twenty-one times. When he went to work in the morning and at noon, he always brought a load of fertilizer to the field, and when he finished work in the evening, he brought feed home. When he went to plow the field, he brought a rake head. Plowing the field is hard work, and after plowing for a while, the oxen need to rest, so he picked up the rake head to dig the corners of the field. In this way, both the labor of digging the corners of the field was saved, and the people and oxen were able to rest. According to his own introduction, the experience is: look at things and think about things, look at things and arrange things, do this and think about that, do today's work and think about tomorrow's things.

    These people may not have studied dialectics, but their thinking is dialectical. They did not think of living things as dead, but they thought of things that seemed dead as alive. Therefore, when they work, they are always on the right track, they are always successful, and their path becomes wider and wider.

    Chairman Mao taught us: "To fully reflect the entire thing, to reflect the essence of the thing, to reflect the internal laws of the thing, it is necessary to go through the role of thinking, and to transform the rich sensory materials through the process of discarding the crude and selecting the fine, discarding the false and preserving the true, proceeding from this to that, and from the surface to the inside, creating a system of concepts and theories." This "discarding the crude and selecting the fine, discarding the false and preserving the true, proceeding from this to that, and from the surface to the inside" is the key to our thinking about problems. We must master it well. Everything must go through serious comparison, analysis, connection, and reasoning; distinguishing its crude and fine, distinguishing its true and false, recognizing its this and that, surface and inside; only in this way can we dig out its essence, penetrate its superficial and false phenomena, and deeply expose its essence and objective laws of development.

    Thinking is an arduous labor. It not only requires the spirit of diligent thinking and hard thinking, but also requires the correct viewpoint of observing problems and scientific methods of analysis. Any intellectual lazy person, and subjective person, and self-righteous person will run into a wall. Chairman Mao told us in his article "Study and the Situation": "Lenin and Stalin often advised people to be good at thinking, and we should also advise people in this way. The function of the machine of the brain is specifically for thinking. Mencius said: 'The function of the mind is to think.' He gave a correct definition of the function of the brain. Everything should be thought about carefully with the brain. As the saying goes: 'A plan comes to mind with a furrowed brow.' This means that more thinking leads to wisdom. To remove the strong blindness in our party, we must promote thinking, learn the method of analyzing things, and cultivate the habit of analysis." These words should become our motto.

    学会想问题
    刘心洁
    古人提倡“三思而行”，这看来似乎有些过份，但是这种精神却是值得学习的。鲁迅先生也说过类似的话，他说，一篇文章写完后，至少要看两遍。至少看两遍，也就是说，至少要想两遍，如果光看不想，那也就不必看了。写完后至少要看两遍想两遍，那末，在写之前和写的时候，想的遍数就要更多了。
    要写好一篇文章，需要反复思考，多次推敲，要办好一件事情，又何尝不需要深思熟虑，再三琢磨。
    客观的事物是错综复杂的，有表面现象，有事物本质；表面现象是有形的，事物本质却是内在的，无形的。因此，首先被人们抓住的，总是那些孤立的、互不相关的、五花八门的有形的东西。然而，这些东西是靠不住的，它是凌乱的，片面的，有真有假的，如果我们不对这些东西进行认真的研究和分析，不好好想一想，拣了封皮就是信，把片面当全面，把局部当整体，把现象当本质，那只会把事情办坏，决不可能把事情办好。
    毛主席说过：“人们要想得到工作的胜利即得到预想的结果，一定要使自己的思想合于客观外界的规律性。”怎样才能使自己的思想合于客观外界的规律性呢？那只有多想一想，下一番判断和推理的工夫。开初，人们看到的只是事物的一些表面现象；但一想，感觉事物里面还有点什么东西；又一想，又感觉事物里还有点什么；想的次数越多，积累的材料也就越多，想到的内容也就越丰富。这样，想一次，对事物的认识就深一层。经过反复思考之后，就能找出事物的内在规律，认识事物的本质，从而掌握它，运用它。
    想，是一种脑力劳动。它和任何劳动一样，有多大耕耘，就有多大收获；付出多少心血，就有多少成果。要想在这里开花结果，获得丰收，需要有坚强的意志和刻苦的精神，需要进行辛勤的劳动。
    不想，任何复杂的事物，看来都是简单的、平常的，没有什么可值得注意，但细细一想，即使是最简单的事物，也能发现里面鱼龙变化，奥妙无穷。水壶蒸汽冲动壶盖，这是我们生活中极平常的事，千千万人看了都没动脑子，但瓦特却在这里想出道理发明了蒸汽机。马克思说过“蒸汽机给你一个资本家的社会”，从一把普通的差不多家家户户都有的水壶上，却把整个人类社会推上一个新的世纪；这能说，那样的事情太小、太平常，没意思，不值得一想吗？
    我们中国也有个很有名的故事。宋朝大学者王安石写了一首诗：“京口瓜州一水间，钟山只隔数重山，春风自绿江南岸，明月何时照我还？”其中第三句里的
  “绿”字曾修改了五次。开始写的是“到”字；一想，感觉“到”字不如“过”字好；又一想，觉得“过”还不如“入”字贴切；再一想，又感觉“入”字不如
  “满”字生动；最后才想到一个绝妙的“绿”字，多形象！这说明：任何心得和收获，都是血汗换来的；想得越多、越殷勤，就越能发现事物的真髓，深入事物的妙处。懒得动脑子的人，不勤于动脑子的人，只得交“白卷”，吃零分。
    一首诗歌，有上品中品下品之分，一个计策（办法、措施），也有上策中策下策之别。不用脑子，固然谈不上写好诗篇、出好主意，但用了脑子，如果不深思苦虑，穷根究底，不像王安石这样“语不惊人死不休”，也不可能写出上等的诗篇，出出上等的计策，把工作做到家。
    “脑子越用越灵”，越想，越能想；因为脑子是物质的，它和人身上任何部位一样，肩越挑越有力，腿越跑越有劲，脑子也就越用越发达。反之，水不流则腐，刀不用则生锈，脑子不用则迟钝。世界上任何事物都是一样，总是在运动中求发展，一静止下来，就会衰退，腐败，最后到消亡。
    客观的事物是不断发展的，人对客观事物的认识也是不断发展的，因此，想，是无穷的，没有止境的，这时得想，那时还得想，今天得想，明天还得想。只有不断地琢磨它，研究它，分析它，才能提高自己的认识，掌握住事物的规律。在做事以前，必须“三思而行”，考虑好这样做的作用和效果，可能产生哪些问题，应该采取哪些最有效的步骤和方法。在做的时候，也必须边做边想，及时纠正偏向，改进方法。做完以后，更得好好想想，总结经验教训——即认识客观事物的规律性。
    由于人们的认识往往落后于客观实际，我们当然不可能要求把什么都想好了才去做，更不能要求什么事情只能做好，不能做坏。试验性的、摸索性的工作还是要做，有时候失败也是不可避免的。事先，或许考虑得还不很周到、全面，但这并不是说就不能做工作了，这里重要的问题是：只要勤于用脑子，苦于用脑子，不断地进行思索，边做边想，就可以不断地修改它，充实它，使它日益完善。有时即算是失败了，也不要紧，“吃一堑长一智”，没有失败也就没有成功，这是事物的辩证法；只要我们好好想想，总结经验教训，就可以变坏事为好事，下一次有了经验，就不会重遭复辙了。这里最怕的是这一种人：事前，既没有周密的考虑和安排，事中，又没有“再想两遍”的精神，事完了也就算完了，不再好好总结，做坏了，也不知坏在哪里，结果，一错再错，一直错到底，下一次还得跌交！
    想，不但要勤想、苦想，也有善想与不善想的差别。善想的，真所谓“眉头一皱计上心来”，预见效果；不善想的，想来想去，还是跳不出原来的圈子。所谓善想，并不是说要有特殊的天赋，或者有神机妙算的本领，这里主要是分析问题的观点和方法的问题。也就是说，必须有唯物主义的观点和辩证的方法。因为：只有有了唯物主义的观点，才能处处从客观事实出发，尊重客观事物，实事求是地观察问题；只有掌握了辩证的方法，才能深刻地了解事物的变化，科学地分析事物。
    唯物主义的观点，这是马克思主义观察问题的根本观点，道理大家都懂了，但是在实际考察问题的时候，有些同志却还不能完全做到，有时往往流露出一些唯心主义、主观主义的观点。这里的原因是复杂的，因为客观事物首先是通过人们的认识来反映的，这里不但包括人们的思想观点，也包括人们认识事物的深浅程度，因此，人们总是或多或少地带着某些主观成份来认识客观事物的。要想减少或者消除这种主观成份，就必须认真地改造自己的主观世界。
    怎样改造自己的主观世界呢？只有两个方法：一是深入实际；一是多听听群众意见。深入实际，就能使自己了解实际。毛主席说过：“你要知道梨子的滋味，你就得变革梨子，亲口吃一吃。你要知道原子的组织同性质，你就得实行物理学和化学的实验，变革原子的情况。你要知道革命的理论和方法，你就得参加革命。一切真知都是从直接经验发源的。”不深刻了解实际，也就说不上从实际出发，说不上实事求是地观察问题。多听听群众意见，就能补充、修改和充实自己的意见；因为个人的所见所闻总是有限的，只有群众的智慧和经验才是无穷的。
    辩证的方法，这是马克思主义者分析问题的根本方法，但是并不是说每一个同志都掌握了这个方法。有些同志看问题，还往往只看到了这一面，没有看到那一面；看到了事物的本身，没有看到事物的周围；看到了现在，没看到过去和将来；看到了静，没看到动；看到了此时此地，没看到彼时彼地……这种片面的形而上学的思想方法，当然不可能正确地思考问题，分析事物，认识事物。
    掌握了科学的方法，会想的人，总是把问题想得很宽泛、很深远，善于联想，善于比较，善于抓特点，善于判断，善于推敲。去年春天我到过江苏常州一次，常州有个小酒厂，原本因原料不足经常停工，但他们有一次听谁说过稻草里面含有淀粉，他们就想：做酒的原料谷物主要是靠淀粉，既然稻草里含有淀粉，想必也可以酿酒。果然不错，经过多次试验，成功了，酒味纯正强烈。他们已投入了生产。
    最近看报，湖南长沙县有个青年农民张守功，一年做了七百一十多个劳动日。一年才三百六十五日，怎么能做这么多劳动呢？除了勤奋以外，就是他会想。过去出凼粪，总是一人挑一担，他想道：水不是有浮力吗，如果改用拖泥船拉，既省事，又省力。改进后，工效提高五六倍。以往的圆凼都是挖在田角上，到开春出粪时，再往田里各个地方送，往返距离远，浪费工，他想道：如果把凼子作在田中间，把圆凼改成长形凼，就方便多了。社员从后山运肥，中间隔了一条小溪，要绕一段弯路，他就想出搭一条便桥的办法，提高工效二十一倍。他早上、中午出工，总是顺便带一担肥料下田，晚上收工就顺便挑饲料回家。去犁田就带一把耙头，犁田活重，犁了一阵，耕牛要休息，他就拿起耙头去挖田角弯，这样，既省了挖田角的人工，人和牛也休息了。根据他自己介绍的经验，就是：看事想事，看事安排事，做这宗想那宗，干今天的活想明天的事。
    这些人，可能没学辩证法，但他们的思想却是辩证的，他们没有把活的事物想死，而是把看来是死的事物想活了。因此，他们工作起来，头头是道，左右逢源，路子越走越宽。
    毛主席教导说：“要完全地反映整个的事物，反映事物的本质，反映事物的内部规律性，就必须经过思考作用，将丰富的感觉材料加以去粗取精、去伪存真、由此及彼、由表及里的改造制作工夫，造成概念和理论的系统。”这个“去粗取精、去伪存真、由此及彼、由表及里”，就是我们思考问题的钥匙。我们必须很好掌握它，什么事情，必须经过认真的比较、分析、联系和推理；分别它的粗和精，辨别它的真和伪，认识它的此和彼、表和里；只有这样，才能挖掘它的精髓，透过它的表面的和虚假的现象，深入揭发它的本质和客观的发展规律。
    想，是一种艰苦的劳动，不但要有勤思苦想的精神，也要有观察问题的正确观点和科学的分析方法，任何思想懒汉，和主观主义者、自以为是的人，是会碰壁的。毛主席在“学习和时局”一文中告诉我们：“列宁斯大林经常劝人要善于思索，我们也要这样劝人。脑筋这个机器的作用，是专门思想的。孟子说：‘心之官则思’。他对脑筋的作用下了正确的定义，凡事应该用脑筋好好想一想。俗语说：
  ‘眉头一皱，计上心来’。就是说多想出智慧。要去掉我们党内浓厚的盲目性，必须提倡思索，学会分析事物的方法，养成分析的习惯。”这些话应该成为我们的座右铭。
