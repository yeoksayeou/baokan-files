Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 18th. Soviet engineers have developed a construction plan for the Lower Ob River Hydropower Station, a power station with unprecedented generating capacity. Located near the Arctic Circle, this hydropower station will have a generating capacity exceeding the Krasnoyarsk Hydropower Station currently under construction on the Yenisei River, which has a generating capacity of 4.2 million kilowatts.

    The Lower Ob River Hydropower Station is planned to be built 15 kilometers south of Salekhard, where the Ob River flows into the Kara Sea. It is part of a huge project to comprehensively utilize the Ob River's water resources and is the last step in a series of cascade hydropower stations on this great river. Its first step, the Novosibirsk Hydropower Station, was fully completed at the end of March this year. Its second step, the Kamensk Hydropower Station, is currently under construction and is expected to be completed before the end of 1960.

    The Lower Ob River Hydropower Station is expected to be completed in five and a half years. According to the design proposed by Soviet scientists, this hydropower station will be equipped with a batch of turbines, each with a capacity of 200,000 kilowatts. It will have an unprecedentedly huge artificial reservoir, with a water surface area of more than 83,000 square kilometers, more than twice the size of Denmark's territory. Due to the large size of the reservoir, the water level of this artificial sea will only rise slightly during the Ob River's spring floods, without the need to build a water-retaining dam with concrete. This will greatly reduce the project cost of this giant hydropower station, making its construction cost about 25% lower than the Lenin Volga Hydropower Station on the Volga River, which has a generating capacity of 2.3 million kilowatts.

    The Ob River is 3,000 kilometers long, and in terms of drainage area, it is the largest river in the Soviet Union. According to the plan proposed by Soviet scientists, thirteen cascade hydropower stations will be built on this river and its tributary, the Irtysh River, with a total generating capacity of about 10 million kilowatts, producing a total of 52 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity per year.

    The construction of the Lower Ob River Hydropower Station is of great significance not only for the development of Siberia's economy but also for the development of other regions of the Soviet Union. According to the recommendations of the designers of this hydropower station, the electricity generated by the downstream hydropower stations on the Ob River can be transmitted to the Ural industrial area through a 1,000-kilometer-long high-voltage transmission line, or to the central and northwestern regions of the European part of the Soviet Union, more than 2,000 kilometers away, to supply these regions with cheap electricity.

### 在北极圈附近  在下鄂毕河上  苏联将建举世无双的大电站

    在北极圈附近  在下鄂毕河上
    苏联将建举世无双的大电站
    新华社莫斯科18日电　苏联工程师已经制定出了一个发电能力举世无双的下鄂毕河水电站的建设方案。这个座落在北极圈附近的水电站的发电能力超过了目前正在叶尼塞河上建设的、发电能力为四百二十万瓩的克拉斯诺雅尔斯克水电站。
    下鄂毕河水电站计划建设在鄂毕河流入喀拉海的地方——萨列哈尔德城以南十五公里处。它是苏联综合利用鄂毕河的水力资源的巨大工程的一部分，是这条大河的一系列梯级水电站的最后一个梯级。它的第一个梯级——新西伯利亚水电站已经于今年3月底全部建成，它的第二梯级——卡门斯克水电站目前正在加紧进行建设，预计将在1960年年底以前建成。
    下鄂毕河水电站预计可在五年半的时间内建成。根据苏联科学家提出的设计方案，这座水电站将安装一批功率各为二十万瓩的涡轮机。它将拥有一个空前巨大的人工水库，水库的水面面积达八万三千平方公里以上，比丹麦的领土面积还大一倍。由于水库面积如此之大，在鄂毕河春季泛滥时，这个人造海的水位只是稍有提高，而不须用混凝土建造拦水坝。这样，就可以大大降低这座巨型水电站的工程造价，使它的建设成本大约比伏尔加河上的发电能力为二百三十万瓩的列宁伏尔加水电站低25％。
    鄂毕河长达三千公里，就流域面积来说，它是苏联最大的一条河流。根据苏联科学家提出的方案，将在这条河流和它的支流——额尔齐斯河上建设十三座梯级水电站，其总发电能力约达一千万瓩，每年总共可以生产五百二十亿度电。
    建设下鄂毕河水电站不仅对发展西伯利亚的经济，而且对发展苏联其他一些地区的经济具有重大意义。根据这座水电站的设计者的建议，将来可以把鄂毕河下游的水电站生产的电力通过一千公里长的高压输电线输送到乌拉尔工业区，或者输送到两千公里以外的苏联欧洲部分的中心地区和西北地区，为这些地区供应便宜的电力。
