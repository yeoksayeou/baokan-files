    Advisory Group
    "Qiyi" Magazine Reporter
    The Qingming Festival had long passed, but the cotton stalks in the cotton fields of the Houyuan Team of the Huopai Commune in Xiangyang County had not yet been pulled out, and several paddy fields to be planted with mid-season rice had not been ridged. Some young people wandered idly around the village in broad daylight. At this moment, Comrade Zhang Shudong, who had been transferred from the Rural Work Department of the Xiangyang Prefectural Committee to serve as Deputy Director of the Liaoyuan Management Area, came to this team to help with the work.

    As soon as the villagers saw this cadre sent from above, they started talking all at once. Old Granny Li Guoquan said, "This won't do. We still have to make a Great Leap Forward in 1959!" Old Zhang was very anxious when he heard this. He talked to several team cadres, but couldn't come up with a solution. One day, during lunch, the villagers started discussing again. An elderly person said, "If you can't hit the iron on the blade, what can you do?!" A young man glared at him and said, "You old fogeys aren't enthusiastic about working, all you do is make destructive remarks." Another old man tugged at the sleeve of the elderly person who had just spoken: "Say less, the old fogeys aren't 'respected' anymore!" Old Zhang thought, maybe these two elderly people are experienced farmers? He inquired and found that the first speaker was called Zhang Shunlai, nicknamed "Old Field Expert," and the second speaker was Zhang Jishuang, also an experienced farmer.

    After lunch, Zhang Shudong, Zhang Shunlai, and Zhang Jishuang squatted under the shade of a tree. Zhang Shudong said he wanted to learn how to farm from the two elders. Zhang Jishuang said, "We are old conservatives, who doesn't know? If we say something wrong, we'll get 'scraped' (meaning 'shaved'). Don't ask us about production, you should go find the team leader." Zhang Shunlai said, "We old guys can't bear to see this situation without saying anything, but if we say something, we'll get 'scraped,' so we'll just do what the cadres tell us to do." It seemed that these two elders were unwilling to tell the truth. Why? Last year, Zhang Yufa, the Deputy Secretary of the General Branch of this management area, openly put forward a slogan calling for "guarding against old fogeys." The old farmers were often criticized for discussing production. Therefore, Zhang Shudong repeatedly persuaded the two elders to speak boldly. Zhang Shunlai finally said, "If you think highly of us, we'll offer a suggestion. We don't ask for much, just listen to one or two sentences out of a hundred. It will also benefit the Great Leap Forward." Then he began to list the current production problems of the team: "'It's good to plant cotton before Qingming.' Qingming has long passed, and there are still more than forty mu of spring cotton that haven't been planted, and more than fifty mu of millet land haven't been plowed... To tell the truth, I can't sleep with so much on my mind! Our team leader is a veteran who used to be a barber, he's not very good at production, he's sweating and busy, but the crops haven't been planted." At this time, the old farmer Zhang Xingfa, who was squatting on the side, also chimed in: "If we want a Great Leap Forward in production, there should also be a Great Leap Forward in fertilizer! Otherwise, you're fooling the land, and the land will fool you." Zhang Shudong saw that the old farmers were hitting the nail on the head with every sentence, so he invited them to participate in the team committee that evening. As soon as Zhang Shudong left, the old farmers said, "Why are they looking at us old guys again this year? There's a way!"

    Zhang Shudong found the team cadres and young activists, and told them the old farmers' opinions, but was immediately "besieged." Team leader Zhang Congshan said, "Those dead conservatives, they see this as bad, that as bad. If we listen to them, it'll be a 'disaster.'" Women's group leader Jiu Ju followed up, saying, "Alas, they're afraid of meetings at night, they don't want to do heavy work, and they still have a lot of opinions!" Activist Zhang Ruying saw that Zhang Shudong hadn't taken her words to heart, so she "persuaded" him from the side: "Look, they grumble when we adopt new technologies. They purse their lips when we have meetings. Can we let them express their opinions? The movement requires a sprint, the tasks must be completed, who has time to discuss with them?" Zhang Shudong asked back, "Are you saying that none of the old farmers' opinions are correct?" Someone said, "Some are." Zhang Shudong said, "That's good. Even one is good." Although people didn't say anything more, they didn't understand in their hearts.

    In the evening, the team committee meeting was held, and several old farmers came, squatting far away in the corner of the room. Zhang Shudong invited them to sit in front of the light. Zhang Shunlai went, but Zhang Jishuang said, "This is our old spot, we're comfortable sitting against the wall." At the beginning, the cadres and young activists rushed to speak. The three old farmers squinted their eyes and listened, smiled, and didn't say anything. Zhang Shudong said, "Old comrades, please say something too." Zhang Jishuang said, "Shouldn't we plant the cotton?" Zhang Shunlai followed up: "'If you can't marry a wife, it's for a lifetime, if you can't plant crops, it's for a season.'" Hearing this, the cadres got angry. Team leader Zhang Congshan said, "Are you saying that the cadres are just playing around all day and not working?" This head-on blow interrupted the old farmers' train of thought again. Women's team leader He Cunying then began to assign work, without mentioning the urgent planting of cotton. The old farmers were angry when they saw that the planting of cotton was not arranged. Zhang Shunlai stood up and said, "I'm sick, I can't stay up late, I'll take my leave." Communist Youth League member Guo Fuquan said, "Old people, you're sleepy, you can leave if you want." Zhang Shunlai patted his butt and left. Zhang Jishuang and Zhang Xingfa also slipped away. The meeting ended in discord. Zhang Shudong chased after everyone and said, "We should still rush to plant the cotton." The team leader said, "Okay, regardless of the consequences, everyone go plant cotton tomorrow."

    The next day, dozens of laborers crowded into three mu of cotton fields. The cotton stalks in this field hadn't been pulled out, no fertilizer had been applied, and the villagers hadn't brought a single cow. The cadres and villagers just shouted, "Do it! Do it!" but they were just jostling and couldn't get started. Some villagers said, "Ha! This is really like the Yang family generals, all at once." At this time, Zhang Shudong and Zhang Shunlai came with a cow. Zhang Shunlai stood on the edge of the field and looked around, then said to himself, "A blacksmith who knows how to strike will do it in three or two blows, but one who doesn't know how will just clang and clang, just sweating and not getting any work done." Zhang Shudong heard this and called the cadres to hold a field meeting, asking Zhang Shunlai to make a suggestion and then allocate the work. Zhang Shunlai discussed with them and divided the people into four groups: some pulling cotton stalks, some plowing the land, some delivering fertilizer, and the remaining people were assigned other tasks. In this way, everyone was put to use. It looked clear and organized, no longer a chaotic mess.

    At the team committee meeting that evening, the team leader said embarrassedly, "There were shortcomings in the work assignment last night, it was chaotic during the day." Some people laughed when they heard this. Zhang Shudong said, "Let's discuss it again." The team committee members then looked at the old farmers. Zhang Xingfa was happy, and moved towards the light while saying, "As I see it, there's a lot of work to do, it all depends on how the team leader arranges it." The team leader was a little impatient, he said, "Comrade Zhang asked you to speak, what do you want me to say!" The women's team leader also said, "Let you speak, so speak!" Zhang Jishuang said, "I think the manure should be mashed, right?" Group leader An Ju, hearing this, felt uncomfortable and interrupted, "Wasn't it mashed already?" Jishuang said, "Mashed? Like the scale, a big pile of cow dung, can the seedlings come out?" An Ju was speechless. Jishuang pointed to Zhang Shunlai and said, "Let 'Old Field Expert' speak." Hearing the call "Old Field Expert," Zhang Shunlai laughed. He said politely, "Alas, I can't say anything either." Then he went on with a rush, "It's late for spring cotton, but it still has to be planted, millet and sorghum should also be arranged, sweet potato seedlings need to be watered, and the rice paddies need strong seedlings..." He put forward twelve kinds of work in a row, and then said, "There's a lot of work, so pick the important ones to do first. I think cotton, millet, and sorghum are the big things. Cotton is the most urgent, so we should focus on it first." After speaking, he smiled, "I'm just talking nonsense, the team leader should decide." His remarks were convincing, "No wonder he's worn cowhide pants for so many years." The meeting was energetic, and when it broke up, everyone saw that the small alarm clock on the table was past one o'clock at night, and none of the old farmers were dozing off.

    With this one experience, the knot was untied. The cadres and young activists changed their views on the old farmers. No one called them "old fogeys" or "old conservatives" anymore. Zhang Shudong discussed with several team committee members and established an "Advisory Group" to work under the leadership of the team committee. The group consisted of five people: old farmers Zhang Shunlai, Zhang Jishuang, and Zhang Xingfa; middle-aged He Cunying; and young Guo Fuquan (a Communist Youth League member). They elected "Old Field Expert" as the group leader. Guo Fuquan had worked in the technical team and became the deputy group leader. At the time of the establishment of the advisory group, Zhang Shunlai said, "There are many things to do, we can't do everything, we'll just do our best in three things. First, there should be a sense of what to do in what season, what to do first and what to do later. The second is to manage the evaluation of work points. The third thing is to lend a hand in technical work and set an example for young people."

    When people listened to the old farmers, they became more energetic. Zhang Shunlai said, "If we don't work hard, we'll really let down Chairman Mao." He did what he said, and his words and actions were all capable and fresh, he really knew how to strike at the "seven inches" of a snake. One night, when discussing work points for small-scale contracting, Zhang Shunlai said, "Work has light and heavy tasks, coarse and fine tasks, and work points should be higher for those that deserve it. The work points for plowing fields are not as good as those for weeding, who would want to plow fields?" The team committee discussed and agreed that this was right, and work point quotas were re-evaluated according to the tasks. Once the work points were reasonable, people rushed to do heavy and dirty work. Guo Fuquan said, "We couldn't get people to do heavy work before, because we didn't find the trick."

    Zhang Shunlai took the initiative to take charge of the sweet potato seedlings. During transplanting, the team didn't assign him work, but he still jumped into the field despite his edema, teaching the new planters by hand. There were old and young people learning from him, as well as middle school students. On the first day, six people only transplanted 1.7 mu, but later, young student Zhang Congjun transplanted 1.4 mu by himself in one day, and also planted them straight and tidy. There were three nearby production teams, and the Houyuan Team was the first to complete the transplanting task. The five barren paddy fields that had been abandoned for decades were also planted with mid-season rice this time, as suggested by the advisory group.

    It's strange to say, in the past, when young people and old farmers were at odds, no one would admit their shortcomings, but now the old farmers also admitted their mistakes. Zhang Shunlai said, "I've also seen that it's good to plant crops densely. Last year, I said 'sorghum that walks under a cow, cotton that sleeps under a cow,' wasn't that conservative?"

    "A master reveals himself with a single move." Just talking about weeding millet and sorghum, it was originally said to take twenty days, but the old farmers calculated it and finished it neatly in six days. Everyone discussed it again. The cadres said, "I used to work blindly, and I ended up being criticized by superiors, dissatisfied by the masses, and complained about by my wife, three sides not pleasing. This time, the masses applaud, my wife nods, and I'm just waiting for the superiors to award a big red flag." The villagers said, "What a coincidence, we don't 'burn the midnight oil' at night meetings, and we don't get 'scraped' during the day, so we're happy to work." Once the road is right, we can stand up straight and have a high heart. The Houyuan Team put forward the slogan of "surpassing Wanzi (a neighboring team) and catching up with Zhangdian (an advanced neighboring team)." Zhang Shunlai said, "Look, if we discuss things this way, we won't boast, we can earn an extra hundred or two hundred catties per mu, we've got it in our hands."

    Good news travels far and wide, and the management area is coming to the Houyuan Team to hold an on-site meeting. The Houyuan Team is rushing forward like an arrow, and the Zhangdian Team leader Zhang Guangming is a little flustered, asking everyone he meets, "What's the trick? Why has the Houyuan Team changed so quickly?" What's the trick? The trick is that cadres, old farmers, and young people discuss together what work to do.

    顾问小组
    “七一”杂志记者
    清明节早过去了，襄阳县伙牌公社后园小队的棉花地里的棉秆还没有拔，几块要插中稻的水田也没有起坂。有些年轻人大白天甩着手在村子里闲逛。正在这时候，从襄阳地委农村工作部下放到燎原管理区当副主任的张树栋同志，到了这个小队来帮助工作。
    社员一见这位上边派来的干部，你一言，我一语，说开了。老奶奶李国全说：“这样下去不行，我们1959年还要大跃进呀！”老张听了很着急，找了几个队干部谈了谈，没谈出个路数来。一天，吃午饭，社员们又议论开了，一位老年人说：“打铁打不到刀刃上，怎么得了？！”一位年轻人听了这话，瞪他一眼说：“你们老家伙，干活不积极，光说破坏话。”另一个老汉把刚才说话的那位老年人的袖子拉了一下：“少说一句吧，老家伙不‘主贵’啦！”老张心想，这两位老年人也许是老把式吧？他打听了一下，果然不错，先说话的那个叫张顺来，外号“老田精”，后说话的那个叫张吉双，也是老把式。
    饭后，张树栋和张顺来、张吉双三个人蹲在树荫下，张树栋说要向两位老人家学做庄稼。张吉双说：“我们是老保守，谁不知道？说错了就‘刮杆’（‘刮胡子’的意思）。生产的事别问我们，你还是去找队长吧。”张顺来说：“我们老家伙见到这情形，不说话心里过不去，说了，挨‘刮杆’，干脆，一退六二五，干部怎么布置就怎么搞。”看来，这两位老人家都不大愿说真心话。为什么呢？去年这个管理区的总支副书记张玉法，公开提了一个口号，叫作“谨防老家伙”，老农议论生产，常常受打击。因此，张树栋再三劝说这两位老人家大胆地讲，张顺来才说：“你看得起我们，就提一点吧。我们要求不高，一百句，听我们一两句，对大跃进也有好处。”接着他就摆起这个小队当前生产上的问题来：“‘清明前好种棉’。清明早过去了，春花还有四十多亩没种，粟谷地五十多亩没犁……。说老实话，这么些话憋在肚里，哪睡得着觉！我们队长是转业军人，从小剃头，生产不大在行，手忙脚乱一身汗，庄稼也没种下去。”这时候，蹲在一边的老农张兴发也插上来：“想生产大跃进，肥料也该来个大跃进吧！要不，你哄地，地哄你。”张树栋看到老农们句句话都说到了要紧的地方，就邀他们参加当晚的队委会。张树栋一走，老农们说：“今年怎么又看上我们老家伙了？有门（有办法的意思）！”
    张树栋找到队干部和青年积极分子，说老农们的意见如何长短，
  马上受到“围攻”。队长张从山说：“那些死保守，看着这不好，那不好。要听他们的可就‘坏菜’啦。”妇女组长九菊跟着说：“唉，他们夜里怕开会，重活不想干，意见还多哩！”积极分子张如英见张树栋没把这话听进去，就又在一边“说服”他：“你看，我们搞新技术，他们一边嘀咕。我们开会，他们撇嘴。能让他们发表意见？运动要突击，任务要完成，谁有时间跟他们商量。”张树栋反问了一句：“你们说，老农的意见没一条对的？”有人说：“也有。”张树栋说，“这就行。有一条也好。”人们虽然没有再说什么，可是心里没想通。
    晚上开队委会，几个老农来了，远远地在屋角蹲着。张树栋招呼他们坐到灯前边来，张顺来算是去了，张吉双说：“这是我们的老场子，靠墙角坐着美气。”开头，干部、青年积极分子抢着说了一通。三个老农眯起眼听着，笑笑，不说话。张树栋说：“老同志们也说说。”张吉双就说了句：“棉花，该种下去吧？”张顺来跟着说：
  “‘娶不上媳妇一辈子，种不上庄稼一季子’。”一听这话，干部们恼火了，队长张从山说：“这么说干部就天天转着玩，没干活？”迎头这一杠子，老农的话头又给打断了。妇女队长何存英接着就派起活来，抢种棉花的事一字没提。几个老农看到又没安排种棉花，也气了。张顺来站起来说：“我有病，熬不得夜，先走一步。”共青团员郭福全说：“老年人，瞌睡多，要走就走吧。”张顺来拍拍屁股走了。张吉双和张兴发也跟着溜了。这次会就算不欢而散。张树栋追着大家说：“棉花还是抢种一下。”队长说：“行，不管三七二十一，明天都给我去种棉花。”
    第二天，几十个劳动力拥在三亩棉花地里。这块地的棉秆没拔，没上粪，社员也没牵一条牛来。干部和社员光喊：“搞哇！搞哇！”就是挨挨挤挤，放不开手。有的社员说：“嗬！这真是杨家将，一齐上。”这时，张树栋同张顺来牵着牛来了。张顺来在地边上站着一望，就自言自语的说：“会打铁的三下二锤，活就出来了，不会打铁的也是叮叮当，就是光出汗，不出活。”张树栋听了，招呼干部来开个田头会，要张顺来提个意见，再把活分派一下。张顺来和他们合计着，把人分成四个班子，有的拔棉柴，有的犁地，有的送粪，多余的人另派了活。这样，人手都用上了，看上去眼里清爽，心里利落，再不是一窝蜂，胡隆隆了。
    当晚再开队委会，队长不好意思的说：“昨夜派工有缺点，白天乱了群了。”有人听着笑了起来。张树栋说：“大家再研究吧。”队委们这时都望着几个老农。张兴发高兴了，一边往灯前凑，一边说：“照我看，活多得很，就看队长怎样安排。”队长又有点沉不住气，他说：“张同志让你们说嘛，你叫我说个球！”妇女队长也说：“让你们说，你们就说嘛！”张吉双说：“我看粪得捣（弄细）吧？……”“组长安菊听着不顺耳，他截着问：“不是捣过了？”吉双说：“捣过了？像秤它，大牛粪一盖，出苗？”安菊没话了。吉双指指张顺来说：“‘老田精’说说吧。一听喊“老田精”，张顺来乐了，他客气了一句：“唉，我也说不到啥。”接着就一股劲摆下去了：“春花晚了，还是得种，粟谷、高粱也该安排，红薯芽要浇水，秧田要壮苗，……”他一连提出十二种活路，接着又说：“活路多，先拣要紧的拾掇。我看棉花、粟谷、高粱是大头。棉花又最吃紧，要先突击。”说完了，他又笑笑，“我这算胡说，还是队长决定。”他这一讲，听的人口服心服：“不亏人家多穿了几年牛裆裤。”这个会开得有劲，散会的时候，一看，桌上的小闹钟过夜一点了，几个老农，没有一个打瞌睡的。
    有了这一场，疙瘩解开了。干部和青年积极分子对老农的看法变了一个样，没人再喊“老家伙”、“老保守”了。张树栋就和几个队委商量，成立了个“顾问小组”。在队委会领导下工作。这个小组有五个人，老农有张顺来、张吉双、张兴发，中年的有何存英，郭福全是个年轻人（共青团员）。他们选出了“老田精”当组长。郭福全在技术队搞过，当了副组长。成立顾问小组的时候，张顺来说：“事多了，做不了，我们就在三件事上尽点力。第一，啥季节干啥活，那先那后得有个讲究。第二是管评工分。第三件是技术活多伸伸手，给年轻人做个样子。”
    老农的话有人听了，他们就越有劲头了。张顺来说：“再不好好出点力，可真对不起毛主席。”说到做到，他的口讲手做，事事能、样样鲜，真是会打蛇的往“七寸”上使劲。一天晚上研究小段包工工分，张顺来说：“活有轻重，有粗细，工分该高的就得高点。整田的工分比不上薅草的，谁愿整田？”队委一商量，这话对，按活路又评了工分定额。工分一合理，重活、脏活人们都抢着干了。郭福全说：“原来重活派不动，是没找到这个窍。”
    张顺来主动包管了红薯芽子。插秧时，队里没派他的活，他仍然不顾自己的黄肿病，跳下田，把着手教新手插秧。跟着他学的有老有少，还有中学生。头一天，有六个人，一天才插了一亩七，后来青年学生张从俊，一个人一天就插了一亩四分，还栽的竖成趟，横成行。近边有三个生产小队，后园小队头一个完成了插秧任务。五丘荒了几十年的水田，这次顾问小组提出来，也栽上了中稻。
    说起来也怪，过去青年人和老农顶牛的时候，谁有缺点也不认账，这时候老农也认错了。张顺来说：“我也看出来了，庄稼密点有好处。去年我说‘走牛的高粱，卧牛的棉花’，不是保守是个啥？”
    “行家一伸手，便知有没有”。光说薅粟谷、高粱这件事，原说要二十天，几个老农给一比划，六天就搞了个光光净。大家又是一番议论，干部说：“早先懵着干，落得个上级批评，群众不满，老婆埋怨，三面不讨好。这回，群众叫好，老婆点头，就等上级奖个大红旗了。”社员们说：“巧事，夜里开会不‘熬鹰’，白天干活没‘刮杆’，活可干的欢了。”路子一走对，腰板就挺起来了，心胸也高了，后园小队提出了“超湾子（邻队）、赶张店（邻近的先进小队）”的口号。张顺来说：“看吧，这么商量着办事，不吹牛，一亩多打一两百斤，是在手心里攒着。”
    好事传千里，管理区要来后园小队开现场会了。后园小队像箭一样朝前赶，张店小队队长张广明有点发慌，逢人就问：“啥窍，后园小队变得这样快？”啥窍？窍就是干啥活路，干部、老农、青年共同商量。
