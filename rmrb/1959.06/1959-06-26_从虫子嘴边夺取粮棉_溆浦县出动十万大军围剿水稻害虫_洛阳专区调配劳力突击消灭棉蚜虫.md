    Seizing Grain and Cotton from the Mouths of Insects
    Xupu County Dispatches 100,000 Troops to Suppress Rice Pests
    Luoyang Prefecture Allocates Labor to Eradicate Cotton Aphids

    According to the New Hunan Daily, Xupu County, Hunan Province, dispatched 100,000 troops to launch a general offensive against insect pests. After a comprehensive encirclement, fierce attack, and repeated sweeps, and consistently focusing on pest control techniques to ensure quality, the county's more than 400,000 mu of early and mid-season rice has basically eliminated or suppressed the development of insect pests.

    This pest control campaign began in mid-June. The 100,000-strong army, each with a "gun" (sprayer), in groups of three, attacked in zones, acting uniformly, encircling comprehensively, contracting at all levels, and universally adopting various measures such as chemical spraying, capture, plowing, and fire to launch a war of annihilation against insect pests.

    Shuidong Commune divided into five zones, under the unified command of Party Secretary Comrade Chen Yidu, mobilized more than 15,000 people, over 700 sprayers (powder applicators), and over 7,000 pieces of locally made equipment. Within two days, the entire commune chemically treated over 20,000 mu to kill pests. To completely eliminate insect pests, commune members came up with many good methods. For example, where rice seedlings had already formed a canopy, making it inconvenient to apply pesticides in the fields, many areas adopted the method of spraying by section, organizing acceptance, marking with flags, and checking and supplementing. The Shuiyangping Brigade of Mayangshui Commune also formulated a pest control agreement. The inspection and acceptance team members of Shuidong Commune were not only inspectors but also combatants and technicians.

    In preparing pesticides, the communes also adopted many methods to ensure standards and avoid excessive or insufficient dilution, to fully utilize the effectiveness of local pesticides without wasting them.

    Recently, the county party committee inspected the pest control effectiveness in some communes and found that pests in small plot fields had been basically eliminated, while the survival rate of pests in the middle of large fields was still high. The people of the county are now conducting a re-examination and supplementary work, repeatedly sweeping, and will not cease until complete victory.

    According to the Henan Daily, a cotton field management campaign centered on pest control is widely underway in Luoyang Prefecture. The cotton-producing areas throughout the prefecture have organized a 300,000-strong pest control army to launch a concentrated effort to eliminate cotton aphids, resolutely and thoroughly eradicating aphids in the shortest possible time to ensure the healthy growth of cotton seedlings. As of the 18th, the prefecture had eliminated aphids on more than 800,000 mu of land, accounting for more than 60% of the area affected by pests.

    Another report: Recently, a large number of cotton aphids have appeared in various parts of Luoyang Prefecture. Aphids have infested 70% of the total cotton fields in the prefecture. This year's pest infestation is particularly serious in old cotton-growing areas such as Shan County and Lingbao. After the occurrence of cotton aphids, most areas quickly implemented prevention and control measures. On the evening of June 16, the prefectural party committee held an emergency telephone conference, instructing all counties to immediately conduct a thorough inspection of all cotton fields. In cotton-growing areas where pest infestations have occurred, the eradication of aphids should be the central link in cotton field management. Labor should be allocated, equipment prepared, and a comprehensive action launched to carry out a concentrated pest control campaign. It was required that not a single plant be missed, not a single insect be spared, and continuous and thorough control be carried out until they are completely eliminated. All counties adopted effective measures and quickly launched a mass pest control campaign. Lingbao County convened mobilization rallies for pest eradication, organized by commune, to specifically organize and arrange labor. The Dawang People's Commune extracted 7,000 laborers to invest in a cotton field management campaign centered on pest control. All 595 sprayers were mobilized, and the 45,000 mu of cotton fields affected by pests were all treated once in five days. Daying Commune in Shan County used more than 900 sprayers to treat 6,600 mu of land in one day. Due to the hot weather and high temperatures, the effectiveness of pesticides could easily dissipate. Therefore, all areas increased the dosage of pesticides and shortened the interval between treatments during pest control, carrying out continuous prevention and control.

    Another report: In the concentrated pest eradication campaign, the communes and production teams in Luoyang Prefecture established a contracted responsibility system, accelerating the speed of pest control and improving quality. After the Dongcun Brigade of the Xizhang Commune in Lingbao County implemented the "four-package" responsibility system of packaging tasks, packaging time, packaging quality, and packaging work points, the pest control effectiveness of the 2,100 mu already treated was over 90%. After Mengjin County implemented the method of contracting pest control work, all 70,000 mu of cotton fields affected by pests in the county had been treated once by the 18th. According to inspections, cotton aphids had been basically eliminated in 65,000 mu. To ensure quality, all counties and communes organized acceptance teams to accept and inspect each section of land after treatment.

    Another report: To solve the shortage of pesticides, many communes in Luoyang Prefecture promoted local methods of pest control, such as using *catsear* grass juice, tobacco stem water, and lime-sulfur mixture. The Pingle Commune in Mengjin County used *catsear* grass to extract liquid, added ten times the amount of clear water, and used a sprayer to treat aphids, achieving a pest control efficiency of over 80%. The commercial departments in various regions have conducted inventories of pesticide warehouses. The 12,000 jin of highly toxic pesticides stored by the Luoyang Prefecture Commercial Bureau has been quickly distributed to major cotton-producing areas based on the occurrence of pests in various regions. The more than 3 million jin of various types of 666 powder in stock at county and commune commercial departments has been distributed to production teams. Efforts are also being made to purchase some agricultural machinery and equipment to support pest control work in cotton-growing areas.

    从虫子嘴边夺取粮棉
    溆浦县出动十万大军围剿水稻害虫
    洛阳专区调配劳力突击消灭棉蚜虫
    据新湖南报报道　湖南溆浦县出动十万大军，向虫害发起总攻。经过全面围剿，猛攻巧打，反复扫荡，自始至终注意治虫技术，保证治虫质量，全县四十多万亩早、中稻已基本消灭了虫害或抑制了虫害发展。
    这次治虫运动是在本月中旬开始的。十万大军，每人一“枪”（喷枪），三人一组，分片进攻，统一行动，全面围剿，层层包干，普遍采取药杀、捕捉、刨光、火攻等多种措施，向虫害展开歼灭战。
    水东公社划分五个片，由党委书记陈亿杜同志统一指挥，出动了一万五千多人，喷雾（粉）器七百多部、土药械七千多件，在两天内，全社药杀灭虫两万多亩。为了彻底消灭虫害，社员们想出了很多好办法。例如禾苗已封行，下田打药不方便，各地对虫害较多的田，普遍采取分厢打药的办法，组织验收，插标为记，检查补课。麻阳水公社水阳坪大队并制订了治虫公约；水东公社的检查验收组成员，既是检查员，又是战斗员和技术员。
    在配制农药上，各社也采取了很多办法，力求达到标准，避免掺水过多或过少的现象，以保证充分发挥土农药效力，但又不浪费药。
    最近，县委在一些公社对灭虫效果进行了检查，发现小丘田的虫子已基本消灭，大块田的中间虫子的残存率还很高，全县人民正在复查补课，反复扫荡，不获全胜，决不收兵。
    据河南日报消息　洛阳专区以治虫为中心的棉田管理运动普遍开展，全区各产棉区组织了三十万治虫大军，突击歼灭棉蚜虫，坚决在最短时间内将蚜虫彻底消灭干净，保证棉苗健壮生长。到18日止，全区已消灭八十余万亩土地上的蚜虫，占发生虫害面积的60％以上。
    又讯　最近洛阳专区各地棉蚜虫大量发生，全区已发生蚜虫的，占棉田总数的70％。陕县、灵宝等老棉区今年虫害特别严重。棉蚜发生后，多数地区迅速进行了防治。6月16日晚，地委又召开了紧急电话会议，指示各县立即对所有棉田普遍进行一次深入检查，发生虫害的棉区，将治蚜虫作为棉田管理的中心环节，调配劳力，准备药械，全面行动，开展突击治虫运动。要求一棵不漏，一虫不放，连续彻底防治，直到消灭干净为止。各县采取了有效措施，迅速掀起了群众性的治虫运动。灵宝县以公社为单位召开了灭虫誓师大会，具体组织安排劳力。大王人民公社抽出七千名劳力投入以治虫为中心的棉田管理运动，五百九十五架喷雾器全部出动，五天时间将发生虫害的四万五千亩棉田全部治了一遍。陕县大营公社使用九百多架喷雾器，一天治虫六千六百亩。由于天气热、温度高，药剂效力容易消失，各地在治虫中都增加了药剂分量和缩短了治虫的间隔时间，连续进行防治。
    又讯　在突击灭虫运动中，洛阳专区各公社、生产队，建立了包工责任制，加快了治虫速度，提高了质量。灵宝县西章公社东村大队推行包任务、包时间、包质量、包工分的“四包”责任制后，已治的二千一百亩，杀虫效果在90％以上。孟津县推行治虫包工的办法后，全县发生虫害的七万亩棉田，到18日止已全部治完一遍，据检查有六万五千亩基本消灭了棉蚜。为了保证质量，各县、公社都组织了验收小组，治一块，验收一块。
    又讯　为了解决农药不足，洛阳专区许多公社推广了猫儿眼草汁、烟筋水、石灰硫磺合剂等土法治虫经验。孟津平乐公社用猫儿眼草榨成液汁，加上十倍清水，用喷雾器治蚜虫，灭虫效率达80％以上。各地商业部门对药剂仓库进行了清查。洛阳专区商业局存放的一万二千斤巨毒农药，已根据各地虫害发生情况迅速分配到各主要棉产区。各县和公社商业部门库存的三百多万斤各种六六六粉，已分配到生产队。并且尽力设法购进一部分药械，支援棉区治虫工作。
