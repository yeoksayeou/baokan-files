Xinhua News Agency, June 6th: The spring sowing work in the three northeastern provinces of Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Liaoning has concluded. Currently, farmers in various regions are intensifying efforts in mid-season cultivation and weeding, checking seedlings and replanting, and continuing to utilize wasteland and idle land to expand cultivated areas.

This year, the spring sowing area in the three northeastern provinces has expanded beyond the original plan. Heilongjiang exceeded its spring sowing plan by 50,000 mu. Jilin Province, in addition to basically completing its original sowing plan, has utilized wasteland and idle land to expand cultivated areas by 1.18 million mu. Liaoning Province exceeded its original plan for major grain crops such as corn, millet, and sorghum by 11.8%.

The sowing time in various regions was also generally advanced by ten days to half a month compared to previous years. The "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture" was earnestly implemented, more fertilizer was applied, deep plowing and rational close planting were carried out, and the seedlings that have emerged in various regions are generally growing well. In Heilongjiang Province, which has abundant land and a sparse population, 50% of the 93 million mu of field crops sown this year were cultivated with tractors and new-style animal-drawn farm implements, resulting in fast and good sowing, and the amount of fertilizer applied per unit area also increased significantly compared to last year. Liaoning Province encountered a severe drought in the later stage of sowing. In order to sow in a timely manner, drought-stricken areas mobilized 100,000 people for drought resistance, utilizing all water sources for irrigation and sowing. The province not only overfulfilled its sowing plan for major grain crops, but also cultivated more than 8 million mu of high-yield fields according to technical requirements. This year's sowing work in Jilin was more meticulous than in any previous year, and most of the cultivated land was deeply plowed, prepared, and fertilized.

Because the sowing was early and the seedlings emerged quickly this year, summer hoeing has also generally started earlier. Many communes have combined mid-season cultivation and weeding with checking seedlings and replanting, and applying fertilizer. Spring wheat in Liaoning Province has been weeded twice and fertilized once. Jilin has launched a socialist labor competition in summer hoeing, and has already checked and replanted more than 1.3 million mu.

Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, June 6th: Inner Mongolia's pastoral areas are vigorously developing vegetable production. On the Hulunbuir and Bayannur grasslands, agricultural production professional teams jointly formed by Han Chinese farmers and Mongolian herdsmen from various people's communes are simultaneously expanding the planting area of feed forage and diligently cultivating vegetable bases. At present, thousands of mu of vegetables such as cabbage, green onions, and radishes planted in pastoral areas such as Otog Banner, Alxa Banner, and Abaga Banner are growing well, and some have already begun to be harvested.

The Inner Mongolia grassland, where there was no tradition of growing vegetables before liberation, has gradually established small vegetable gardens in recent years with the advocacy and assistance of the autonomous region's party and government leadership departments, and with the support of manpower, technology, seeds, and agricultural implements from neighboring agricultural areas. This spring, many communes in pastoral areas formulated vegetable planting plans while arranging livestock feed production. The leagues, such as Xilingol League, which are mainly engaged in animal husbandry, plan to sow approximately 40,000 mu of vegetables such as cabbage, radishes, tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, onions, and chives this year.

Vegetable production in the towns and villages of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has also been further developed this year. The total sowing area of vegetables throughout the region has reached more than 1.3 million mu, an increase of 44% compared to last year. The output of commercial vegetables in the suburbs of major cities in the autonomous region such as Hohhot, Baotou, and Jining, and the Daxing'anling forest area, will reach 600 million jin, an increase of more than two times compared to last year.

    东北三省春播又多又细
    辽宁省艰苦抗旱利用一切水源浇地播种
    内蒙古积极扩大牧草面积培植蔬菜基地
    据新华社6日讯　黑龙江、吉林、辽宁三省的春播工作已经结束。目前，各地农民正在加紧中耕锄草、查苗补苗和继续利用荒地、空闲地扩大耕地面积。
    今年，东北三省的春播面积都比原订计划扩大。黑龙江超额五万亩完成春播计划，吉林省在基本完成原订播种计划外，又利用荒地、空闲地扩大耕地面积一百一十八万亩，辽宁省播种的玉米、谷子、高粱等主要粮食作物超额11.8％完成原订计划。
    各地的播种时间也普遍比往年提前了十天到半个月，并且认真地贯彻了农业“八字宪法”，增施了肥料，做到了深耕和合理密植，各地已经出土的小苗普遍生长良好。地多人少的黑龙江省今年播种九千三百万亩大田作物中，50％是用拖拉机和新式畜力农具耕种的，因此播种又快又好，单位面积施肥量也比去年增加许多。辽宁在播种后期遇到大旱，受旱地区为了适时春播，曾出动十万抗旱大军利用一切水源浇地播种，全省不仅超额完成了主要粮食作物播种计划，还按技术要求，培植了八百多万亩高额丰产田。吉林今年的播种工作比以往任何一年都细致，绝大部分耕地也都经过深耕、整地，施肥量也增加很多。
    由于今年播种早、小苗出的快，各地夏锄也普遍提前开始，许多公社还结合中耕锄草查苗补苗和追施肥料。辽宁省的春麦已锄过两次草、追过一次肥。吉林各地在夏锄中开展了社会主义劳动竞赛，已经查苗补种一百三十多万亩。
    据新华社呼和浩特6日电　内蒙古牧区正大力发展蔬菜生产。在呼伦贝尔草原和巴彦淖尔草原上，各人民公社由汉族农民和蒙古族牧民联合组成的农业生产专业队，一面扩大饲料牧草种植面积，一面辛勤地培植蔬菜基地。目前，鄂托克旗、阿拉善旗、阿巴嘎旗等牧区种上的上千亩白菜、大葱、萝卜等蔬菜，生长很好，有的已开始收获。
    解放前从来没有种菜习惯的内蒙古草原，近年来经过自治区党政领导部门的提倡和扶助，并得到邻近农业区人力、技术、种籽、农具的支援，逐渐建立起小型菜园。今年春天，牧区许多公社在安排牲畜饲料生产的同时，都制订了种菜计划。以畜牧业为主的锡林郭勒等盟，今年即计划播种白菜、萝卜、西红柿、辣椒、黄瓜、葱、韭菜等四万亩左右。
    内蒙古自治区城镇、农村的蔬菜生产，今年也有了进一步发展。全区各地蔬菜播种总面积已达一百三十多万亩，比去年增加了44％。自治区主要城市呼和浩特、包头、集宁郊区和大兴安岭林区，商品菜产量将达到六亿斤，比去年增产两倍多。
