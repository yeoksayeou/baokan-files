Washington Dispatch: The June 1st issue of the American "Newsweek," published in advance, carried an article touting the "achievements" of the United States in instigating Laos to tear up the Geneva Accords and provoking a civil war in Laos, thereby seriously threatening peace in Indochina. It said that this proves "American (aid to Laos) is successful."

"Newsweek" praised the actions taken by the Lao Sananikone government with U.S. assistance as an "almost miraculous achievement."

"Newsweek" pointed out that the Lao army trained with U.S. aid "played an active role" in the current Lao situation. The weekly cited as an example that every district chief now appointed by the Lao government "has six specially selected soldiers (from this army) assisting him."

The weekly said that two conclusions can be drawn from the changes in the Lao situation: U.S. aid is successful; and it would be blindly foolish for the United States not to give the Lao authorities unreserved support.

    老挝政府悍然发动内战
    美国报刊大叫美援收效
    本报讯 华盛顿消息：提前出版的6月1日一期美国“新闻周刊”刊载一篇文章，鼓吹美国教唆老挝撕毁日内瓦协议，在老挝挑起内战，从而严重威胁印度支那和平的“成就”，它说，这证明“美国（对老挝的）援助是成功的”。
    “新闻周刊”赞扬老挝萨纳尼空政府在美国援助下采取的行动是“近似奇迹的成就”。
    “新闻周刊”指出，由美援训练出来的老挝军队在目前老挝局势中“起了积极的作用”。这家周刊举例说，老挝政府现在委派的每一个区长，“都有六个特别（从这支军队中）挑选出来的军人辅助”。
    这家周刊说，从老挝局势的变化可以得出两个结论：美援是成功的；如果美国不给老挝当局毫不吝惜的支持，将是盲目的愚蠢行为。
