    Garlic Leaves Can Control Insects
    Many places are now harvesting garlic (underground bulbs). In the past, garlic leaves were often discarded as waste, which is a great pity.
    Garlic leaves are a very effective indigenous pesticide and are even more valuable in the current situation of insufficient pesticide production. Garlic leaves contain volatile propylene sulfide, also known as allicin, which is a good fungicide. According to some publications, the macerated liquid of garlic leaves can prevent eggplant, tomato, and other crops from suffering from blight (this disease causes white fuzz to grow on the fruits, eventually causing them to rot and fall off) and green aphids (also known as plant lice or honey dew insects).
    The method for making the macerated liquid is very simple: first, chop the green garlic leaves into small pieces, then add one catty of garlic leaves to one and a half to two catties of water, soak for ten to twelve days, filter, and then the macerated liquid can be used to kill insects.

    蒜叶可以治虫
    现在许多地方都在收获蒜头（地下鳞茎），过去往往是将蒜叶当作废物扔掉它，这是很可惜的。
    蒜叶是一种非常有效的土农药，在目前农药生产不足的情况下，更有利用的价值。蒜叶中含有挥发性的硫化丙烯，也称为蒜素，它是一种很好的杀菌素。据有的书刊介绍：用蒜叶的浸渍液能防治茄子、番茄等的绵疫病（这种病是在茄果上长白毛，最后使果腐烂脱落）和青蚜虫（也称腻虫或蜜虫）。
    浸渍液的制法很简单：先将绿色的蒜叶切得细碎，然后用一斤蒜叶加一斤半至二斤水，浸泡十至十二天，过滤后，浸渍液就可以用来杀虫。
