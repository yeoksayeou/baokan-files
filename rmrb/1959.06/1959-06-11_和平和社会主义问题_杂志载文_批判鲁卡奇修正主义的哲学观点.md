An article criticizing Lukács’ philosophical views by Béla Fogarasi was published in the sixth issue of "Problems of Peace and Socialism." The article states: Lukács' activities in society and literature are extensive, covering politics, philosophy, aesthetics, and literary studies. Lukács' political thoughts and philosophical views are closely intertwined.

Over the past twenty years, Lukács has published some important works: (1) "The Young Hegel and the Problems of Capitalist Society"; (2) "The Crisis of Bourgeois Philosophy"; (3) "The Destruction of Reason."

Regarding the historical monograph "The Young Hegel," we do not deny that it has some positive aspects, but it has many serious errors. The essence of these errors is that Lukács excessively idealized Hegel's philosophical views. Although the conservative elements in the works of the young Hegel were not as obvious as in his later years, the conservative tendency always existed in Hegel's philosophy.

Lukács believes that, according to Hegel, "man only becomes human on the basis of his own labor," but at the same time, he ignores Hegel's reduction of all kinds of labor to abstract mental labor. Lukács insists that, according to Hegel, in the process of labor, "man's understanding of the laws of nature becomes deeper and deeper, and man forces nature to serve himself," but here he also neglects Hegel's purely idealist interpretation of the cognitive process.

In the collection of speeches "The Crisis of Bourgeois Philosophy," published in 1948, Lukács argues that this crisis lies in the attempt by imperialist philosophy to belittle and denigrate reason. The main idea of the collection is that bourgeois philosophy is increasingly becoming a philosophy of irrationalism, and irrationalism is the most typical manifestation of fascist thought.

However, irrationalism will never be the main issue in philosophy if it is not examined in connection with the problem of idealism. Lukács generally replaces the philosophical question of whether matter is primary or consciousness is primary with questions about methods of cognition (whether they are based on materialism or idealism).

In "The Destruction of Reason," the author says: "To defend reason or to oppose reason simultaneously determines the philosophical essence of philosophy and its role in social development." But the class content of philosophy is by no means limited to defending or opposing reason. The conflict itself—defending or opposing reason—can only be correctly understood on the basis of correctly raising the question of the struggle between materialism and idealism; Lukács sometimes acknowledges this subordination, but believes that it is not of decisive significance.

Lukács believes that the main task of the peace movement is to mobilize the intelligentsia to rise up for reason against the philosophy of irrationalism, which he believes is the foundation of the fascist worldview and imperialist aggression. This way of posing the question, this program, reverses the relationship between social existence and social consciousness, and reverses the relationship between the base and the superstructure.

Marx has a famous saying: Theory, once grasped by the masses, becomes a material force. However, Marx was referring to the theory of scientific socialism, not the vague reason that Lukács speaks of. Lukács' use of the category of "reason" is not only formally but also spiritually very similar to Hegelian idealism. Lenin once commented that the main error in Lukács' article was: "The Marxism in this article is purely verbal."

It is quite obvious that in "The Destruction of Reason," Lukács is actually elaborating on the view of "ideological coexistence" that he expounded in his previous book, "The Crisis of Bourgeois Philosophy," under the pretext of defending reason. It was from this point of view that Lukács published an anti-socialist practical political action program in October 1956, an action that allied him with revisionist traitors. The book "Against Misunderstanding Realism," published by Lukács in West Germany in 1958, proves that Lukács still completely retains his revisionist views on aesthetics, literature, and international political issues.

### “和平和社会主义问题”杂志载文  批判鲁卡奇修正主义的哲学观点

    “和平和社会主义问题”杂志载文
    批判鲁卡奇修正主义的哲学观点
    在“和平和社会主义问题”杂志第六期上，载有贝拉·佛加腊施写的一篇批判鲁卡奇哲学观点的文章，文章说：鲁卡奇在社会和文学方面的活动范围很广，包括政治学、哲学、美学和文艺学。鲁卡奇的政治思想和哲学观点紧密地交织在一起。
    二十年来鲁卡奇发表过以下的一些重要著作：（一）“青年黑格尔和资本主义社会问题”；（二）“资产阶级哲学的危机”；（三）“理性的毁灭”。
    关于“青年黑格尔”这篇历史专题论文，我们不否认它有若干积极方面，但是它有许多严重的错误。这些错误的实质就是，鲁卡奇把黑格尔的哲学观点过分理想化了。虽然在青年黑格尔的著作中保守的成份没有像他在后期那样明显，但保守的倾向在黑格尔的哲学中始终都是存在的。
    鲁卡奇认为，按照黑格尔的说法，“人只有在自己劳动的基础上才成为人”，但同时他却忽视了黑格尔把各种劳动都归结为抽象的精神劳动。鲁卡奇硬说，根据黑格尔的说法，在劳动的过程中“人对自然规律的认识越来越深刻，人迫使自然为自己服务”，但这里他又疏忽了黑格尔对认识过程所作的纯粹唯心主义的解释。
    在1948年发表的演说论文集“资产阶级哲学的危机”里，鲁卡奇认为，这种危机在于帝国主义哲学力图贬低和诋毁理性。文集作者的主要思想就是资产阶级哲学愈来愈变成了非理性主义的哲学，而非理性主义就是法西斯主义思想最典型的表现。
    但是，非理性主义如果不同唯心主义问题联系起来考察，那它就决不会是哲学上的主要问题。鲁卡奇一般地用关于认识方法的问题（不论它们的基础是唯物主义的或是唯心主义的）去代替关于物质是第一性或意识是第一性的哲学问题。
    在“理性的毁灭”里作者说：“拥护理性或是反对理性同时决定着哲学的哲学本质和它在社会发展中的作用。”但是哲学的阶级内容绝不仅仅以拥护理性或反对理性为限。冲突本身——拥护理性或反对理性——只有在正确地提出关于唯物主义和唯心主义之间的斗争问题的基础上，才可能得到正确的认识；鲁卡奇有时也承认这种从属关系，但认为这没有决定性的意义。
    鲁卡奇认为和平运动的主要任务是动员知识界为了理性起来反对非理性主义的哲学，他认为这种哲学是法西斯主义世界观和帝国主义侵略的基础。这样提问题、这样的纲领是颠倒了社会存在和社会意识的关系，颠倒了基础和上层建筑的关系。
    马克思有一句名言：理论一旦掌握群众就变成物质力量。但是，马克思指的是科学社会主义的理论，而不是鲁卡奇所说的含糊不清的理性。鲁卡奇运用“理性”范畴不仅在形式上而且在精神实质上都酷似黑格尔唯心主义。列宁曾经评论鲁卡奇文章的主要错误在于：“这篇文章中的马克思主义纯粹是口头上的”。
    十分明显，鲁卡奇在“理性的毁灭”一书里实际上是在维护理性的借口下，详尽地发挥了他过去在“资产阶级哲学危机”一书中所阐述的那种
  “思想共存”的观点。正是从这种观点出发，鲁卡奇才在1956年10月发表了反社会主义的实际政治行动纲领，这种行动使他同修正主义叛徒结成了联盟。1958年鲁卡奇在西德出版的
  “反对误解现实主义”这本书证明，鲁卡奇在美学、文学以及国际政治问题方面仍然完全保留着自己的修正主义观点。
