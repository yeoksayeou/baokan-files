The United States is Responsible for the Dangerous Situation in Laos
Commentator of this newspaper

    In a statement issued on May 29, the U.S. State Department openly defended its actions of instigating the Royal Lao Government to attack the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units, tearing up the Geneva Accords, and exacerbating tensions in Southeast Asia. It slandered the public opinion of various countries condemning the Lao authorities for breaking their faith as "fabricated"; it insisted that the United States "has nothing to do" with the current dangerous situation in Laos, and that the tense situation in Southeast Asia is due to China's "threat of infiltration, subversion, and hostile military actions."
    Stop thief! This is originally a trick used by American aggressors. The United States attempts to use an absurd statement to deny any responsibility for instigating the Royal Lao Government to tear up the Geneva Accords, launch a civil war, and endanger peace in Indochina, which is obviously just a waste of effort. The facts speak the loudest. Who is carrying out "infiltration, subversion, and threats of hostile military actions" against Laos and Southeast Asian countries, and whether the United States "has nothing to do" with the serious deterioration of the situation in Laos, can be fully understood by looking at the facts.
    In order to turn Laos into a U.S. military base and colony, U.S. imperialism extremely hated the Geneva Accords, which stipulated that Laos should pursue a policy of peace and neutrality, not participate in any military alliances, and not accept foreign military assistance. After the United States failed to obstruct the ceasefire in Indochina at the Geneva Conference, it stepped up its interference and subversion activities in Cambodia and Laos while intensifying its efforts to turn South Vietnam into a base for military aggression, and disregarded the peaceful wishes of the Indochinese people, stubbornly including these countries in the "protection" scope of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization it planned. In early 1955, the United States seriously violated the Geneva Accords by providing the Royal Lao Government with a large amount of "military assistance." In February 1955, former U.S. Secretary of State Dulles personally went to Laos to make arrangements for this; in March of the same year, the United States officially established a "Foreign Aid Mission" in Laos as the executive body for U.S. military, political, and economic aggression against Laos. From then until the first half of 1958, the United States had given Laos $174 million in "aid," most of which was military aid. U.S. weapons and ammunition were continuously shipped into Laos, and a large number of U.S. military personnel entered Laos under the names of "technicians" and "employees" to control the Lao army and military bases.
    In order to completely tear up the Geneva Accords, the United States used various despicable means to blatantly interfere in the political situation of Laos. The United States has tried its best to obstruct and undermine the negotiations for peaceful unification between the Royal Lao Government and the Pathet Lao Fighting Units in accordance with the provisions of the Geneva Accords. Even shortly after the start of this negotiation, it instigated pro-American elements in Laos to assassinate Kou Voravong, the Lao Minister of Defense who advocated negotiations with the Pathet Lao Fighting Units, causing the negotiations to be interrupted. When the Royal Lao Government and the Pathet Lao Fighting Units formed a coalition government based on a mutual agreement, the United States openly opposed it. The U.S. government used the means of suspending "aid," devaluing the Lao currency against the U.S. dollar, and instigating division activities to force the Phouma government, which tended to pursue a policy of peace and neutrality and advocated peaceful unification, to step down, and replaced it with the pro-American Phoui Sananikone government. Recently, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs Robertson admitted while testifying before the U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee that the collapse of the Lao coalition government and the coming to power of a "government strongly inclined toward the free world" was the United States' "most successful plan in the world."
    The crisis that has occurred in Laos in recent months is obviously a new development in the U.S. imperialist conspiracy to invade Laos, and was created single-handedly by U.S. imperialism. After Sananikone came to power in August 1958 with the support of the United States, he immediately implemented a policy of relying on the United States and openly abandoning the Geneva Accords. The Sananikone government further persecuted patriotic and democratic forces and undermined the political agreements on domestic peaceful unification. On February 11 this year, Sananikone issued a statement openly announcing that he would no longer continue to implement the Geneva Accords. U.S. State Department officials immediately issued a statement to encourage him, and stated that the United States could henceforth freely establish a military mission in Laos, "to establish closer ties between Laos and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization," and even "freely participate in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization." Subsequently, the United States, on the one hand, instructed the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc to conduct large-scale military exercises one after another, openly threatening the countries of the Indochina region with force; on the other hand, it formulated a specific "blueprint" for aggression against Laos at the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization Council meeting held in Wellington. After that, the situation in Laos deteriorated more rapidly, and it developed to the point where on May 11, the Lao government broke faith and placed Prince Souphanouvong and other leaders of the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units under house arrest, concentrated a large number of armed forces to launch a large-scale attack on two battalions of the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units, brazenly provoked a civil war, and undermined peace in Laos and Indochina. Can this be concealed by any lies?
    Indeed, the U.S. conspiracy to invade Laos, in many cases, is carried out by using the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and the Thai and South Vietnamese reactionaries. The collusion between the Lao Sananikone government and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization is no longer a secret. Lao authorities have repeatedly sent representatives to participate in the military exercises of the Southeast Asia Treaty aggressive organization. Some Lao officials, including Army Chief of Staff Rathikoun and the Lao Ambassador to Thailand, have repeatedly clamored that "Laos is within the defense area of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization" and openly demanded that the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization come forward to intervene in Laos. Recently, a major conspiracy that the United States is stepping up to plan is: piecing together a tripartite military alliance between Thailand, South Vietnam, and Laos, so as to turn South Vietnam and Laos into de facto members of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. These days, the frequent activities of Lao Foreign Minister Phagna to Saigon and Thai Foreign Minister Thanat Khoman to Vientiane are to realize this conspiracy of the United States. News has been confirmed that the construction of a strategic highway across the Indochina Peninsula, running from South Vietnam through Laos and directly to Thailand, has begun; at the same time, the United States has also chosen Lower Laos (southern Laos) to establish a new large-scale military base to further threaten the peace and security of the entire Indochina and Southeast Asian countries. Of course, the U.S. State Department can deny that all of this was done by it, but by the Thai and South Vietnamese reactionaries. But who doesn't know that the Thai and South Vietnamese reactionaries cannot accomplish anything without the support of the United States.
    In the statement, the U.S. State Department attempted to shift the responsibility for undermining the Geneva Accords to the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units, which is even more despicable and rogue. The former Pathet Lao Fighting Units faithfully and strictly implemented the Geneva Accords relating to Laos and various political agreements reached between it and the Royal Lao Government in accordance with the provisions of the Geneva Accords. The Pathet Lao Fighting Units handed over the administrative power of Phongsaly and Sam Neua provinces and actively carried out the work of incorporating two battalions of troops into the Royal Army. However, in complete contrast, the Royal Lao Government openly declared its abandonment of the Geneva Accords, opposed the Lao International Commission's supervision and inspection activities, wantonly persecuted and arrested personnel of the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units, deprived Lao patriotic parties of their legitimate right to participate in political life, and finally placed the leaders of the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units under house arrest, brazenly launched a civil war, thereby creating the current serious situation in Laos. Anyone with a little bit of reason can distinguish who undermined the Geneva Accords and who endangered peace in Laos and Indochina.
    At present, the U.S. instigation of the Lao authorities to tear up the Geneva Accords has not only created a serious situation within Laos, but also endangered the peace of Indochina and the Far East. China is a signatory to the Geneva Accords and has a solemn responsibility to uphold the Geneva Accords. At the same time, China is adjacent to Laos and Indochina. The United States is establishing new military alliances in Indochina, creating tensions, and instigating the Lao authorities to abandon the policy of peace and neutrality stipulated by the Geneva Accords externally, and to abandon the agreements on democratic unification reached between the Lao authorities and the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units internally, attempting to completely turn Laos into a U.S. base of aggression and colony through the path of civil war and dictatorship, which cannot but threaten China's security. Therefore, the Chinese people certainly cannot turn a blind eye to the increasingly serious situation in Laos.
    The U.S. State Department's issuance of such a statement full of lies and malicious slander at a time when the situation in Laos is rapidly deteriorating is not only an open support for the serious actions of the Lao authorities in launching a civil war, but also indicates that the United States will further interfere in the Lao situation and undermine peace in Laos and Indochina. The Lao authorities have openly clamored for the "help" of the "free world," which has in fact laid the groundwork for further military intervention in Indochina by the United States and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. This cannot but arouse the serious vigilance of all countries and peoples concerned about peace in Indochina.

    美国应对老挝危险局势负责
    本报评论员
    美国国务院在5月29日发表的声明中，公然为它策动老挝王国政府进攻前寮国战斗部队、撕毁日内瓦协议、加剧东南亚紧张局势的行为辩解。它诬蔑各国舆论谴责老挝当局背信弃义的论点是“虚构”的；硬说美国同目前老挝的危险局势“没有任何关系”，而东南亚之所以存在紧张形势倒是由于中国的“渗入、颠覆和采取敌对军事行动的威胁”。
    贼喊捉贼，这原是美国侵略者惯于使用的伎俩。美国企图用一篇荒谬的声明，把唆使老挝王国政府撕毁日内瓦协议，发动内战，危害印度支那和平的罪责推得一干二净，那显然只是白费力气。事实是最雄辩的。究竟是谁在对老挝和东南亚国家进行“渗入、颠覆和采取敌对军事行动的威胁”，究竟美国同老挝局势的严重恶化是不是“没有任何关系”，只要看看事实就可以完全明白了。
    为了把老挝变成美国的军事基地和殖民地，美帝国主义极端地仇视规定老挝奉行和平中立政策、不得参加任何军事同盟和接受外国军事援助的日内瓦协议，这是人所共知的事实。美国在日内瓦会议上阻挠印度支那停战失败之后，一面加紧把南越变成它的军事侵略基地，一面对柬埔寨和老挝不断地进行干涉和颠覆活动，并不顾印度支那人民的和平愿望，硬把这些国家列入它所策划的东南亚条约组织的“保护”范围之下。在1955年初，美国更严重违反日内瓦协议，给予老挝王国政府大量的“军事援助”。1955年2月，前美国国务卿杜勒斯并曾亲自为此到老挝进行布置；同年3月，美国在老挝正式设立“援外使团”，作为美国对老挝进行军事、政治和经济侵略的执行机构。从那时起到1958年上半年，美国已给了老挝一亿七千四百万美元的“援助”，其中绝大部分是军事援助。美国的武器和弹药源源运进老挝，美国大批军事人员在“技术人员”、“雇员”的名义下进入老挝，控制老挝的军队和军事基地。
    为了彻底地撕毁日内瓦协议，美国用了各种卑鄙手段，露骨地干涉老挝的政局。美国曾竭力阻挠和破坏老挝王国政府和寮国战斗部队按照日内瓦协议的规定进行和平统一的谈判，甚至在这个谈判开始后不久，就唆使老挝亲美分子刺杀了主张同寮国战斗部队谈判的老挝国防大臣古·沃拉冯，使谈判陷于中断。而当老挝王国政府和寮国战斗部队根据双方协议组成联合政府以后，美国更公开出来反对。美国政府以中止“援助”、贬低老挝币同美元比价、策划分裂活动为手段，迫使倾向奉行和平中立政策和主张和平统一的富马政府下台，而代之以亲美的培·萨纳尼空政府。最近美国远东事务助理国务卿罗伯逊在美众院外委会作证时供认，老挝联合政府垮台，而一个“强烈地倾向于自由世界的政府”上台，这是美国在“世界上最成功的计划”。
    近几个月来，老挝发生的危机显然是美帝国主义侵略老挝的阴谋计划的一个新的发展，是美帝国主义所一手制造出来的。1958年8月萨纳尼空在美国扶植下执政以后，立刻执行了投靠美国和公然背弃日内瓦协议的政策。萨纳尼空政府进一步迫害爱国民主力量，破坏关于国内和平统一的政治协议。今年2月11日萨纳尼空发表声明公然宣布不再继续履行日内瓦协议，美国国务院官员立即发表声明加以鼓励，并且表示从此美国可以自由地在老挝设立军事使团，“将使老挝同东南亚条约组织建立更紧密的联系”，以至“自由地参加东南亚条约组织”了。接着，美国一方面指使东南亚侵略集团接二连三地举行大规模的军事演习，公开向印度支那地区国家进行武力威胁；一方面在惠灵顿举行的东南亚条约组织理事会会议上具体制订了侵略老挝的“蓝图”。在这之后，老挝局势更迅速恶化，一直发展到5月11日老挝政府背信弃义软禁苏发努冯亲王等前寮国战斗部队领导人，集中大量武装部队大举进攻两营前寮国战斗部队，悍然挑起内战，破坏老挝和印度支那和平。这难道是任何谎言所能掩饰的吗？
    的确，美国侵略老挝的阴谋活动，在很多情况下是利用东南亚条约组织和泰国、南越反动派来进行的。老挝萨纳尼空政府与东南亚条约组织之间的勾结早已不是什么秘密了。老挝当局多次派出代表参加东南亚条约侵略组织的军事演习。老挝的一些负责官员，包括陆军参谋长拉提曲耳和老挝驻泰国大使，曾多次叫嚷“老挝是在东南亚条约组织的防御地区”之内，并且公然要求东南亚条约组织出面对老挝进行干涉。最近，美国正在加紧策划的一个重大阴谋是：拼凑泰国、南越和老挝的三边军事同盟，以便把南越和老挝变成东南亚条约组织的事实上的成员国。这些天来，老挝外交大臣班雅到西贡；泰国外长科曼到万象进行的频繁的活动，就是为了实现美国的这一阴谋。消息已经证实，从南越经过老挝直通泰国的一条横贯印度支那半岛的战略公路已着手修建；同时，美国还选择了下寮（老挝南部）建立新的大型军事基地，以进一步威胁整个印度支那和东南亚各国的和平与安全。当然，美国国务院可以抵赖说，这一切都不是它干的，而是泰国、南越的反动派干的。但是，谁不知道泰国和南越的反动派没有美国的支持，是什么事情也干不成的。
    美国国务院在声明中企图把破坏日内瓦协议的责任推到前寮国战斗部队的身上，这更属卑鄙无赖。前寮国战斗部队忠实地和严格地履行了有关老挝的日内瓦协议以及它与老挝王国政府之间按照日内瓦协议的规定而达成的各项政治协议。寮国战斗部队移交了丰沙里和桑怒两省的行政权，并且积极地进行了将两营部队编入王国军队的工作。但是，与此完全相反，老挝王国政府却公然声明毁弃日内瓦协议，反对老挝国际委员会进行监督和监察活动，大肆迫害和逮捕前寮国战斗部队人员，剥夺老挝爱国党人参加政治生活的合法权利，最后更软禁了前寮国战斗部队的领导人，悍然发动了内战，因而造成了当前老挝的严重局势。稍有理智的人都能辨别，究竟是谁破坏了日内瓦协议，谁危害了老挝和印度支那的和平。
    目前美国策动老挝当局撕毁日内瓦协议，不仅造成了老挝境内的严重局势，而且危及印度支那和远东各国的和平。中国是日内瓦协议的签字国，对维护日内瓦协议负有庄严的责任。同时，中国同老挝和印度支那毗邻，美国在印度支那建立新的军事同盟，制造紧张局势，唆使老挝当局对外背弃由日内瓦协议所规定的和平中立政策，对内背弃老挝当局与前寮国战斗部队达成的有关民主统一的协议，妄图经过内战与独裁的道路，把老挝完全变为美国的侵略基地与殖民地，不能不威胁到中国的安全。因此，中国人民对于老挝日益恶化的严重局势，当然绝不能置若罔闻。
    美国国务院在老挝局势急剧恶化的时候，发表这样一个满纸谎言、血口喷人的声明，不仅对老挝当局发动内战的严重行为是一种公开的支持，而且表明美国将要进一步干涉老挝局势，破坏老挝和印度支那的和平。老挝当局已经公然叫嚣要求“自由世界”的“帮助”，这实际已为美国和东南亚条约集团对印度支那进一步进行军事干涉埋下了伏笔。这就不能不引起一切关心印度支那和平的国家和人民的严重警惕。
