    Pay Attention to Working Methods

    The general Party branch of the Pingtian Brigade of the Bairuo Commune in Changsha has improved its working methods, creating a new situation in this production brigade where everyone is cheerful and their enthusiasm is constantly increasing.

      The experience of the general Party branch of the Pingtian Brigade proves that the working method of assigning tasks downwards through a series of administrative meetings is not a good method. Because this method cannot effectively leverage the initiative of Party branches and Party members; their experience also proves that the working method of having the branch and Party members do everything, regardless of its importance, while setting aside the administration is also not a good method, because this method cannot effectively leverage the initiative of the administrative side and may lead to "taking everything into one's own hands." Now, they closely rely on the Party branches and Party members, frequently conduct meticulous political and ideological work among the masses, pay attention to leveraging the role of the branch as a fighting fortress, thereby strengthening the specific leadership of the production team, but not directly grasping specific affairs, and constantly pay attention to promoting democracy, carrying out discussions, and patiently listening to the opinions of the masses. This working method is the working method of the Party's mass line, and it is also a working method that strengthens political and ideological leadership and avoids "taking everything into one's own hands." The Party committees and general Party branches of communes in various regions can learn from this.

    注意工作方法
    长沙白若公社坪田大队党总支改进了工作方法，使这个生产大队出现了个个心情舒畅，干劲不断高涨的新局面。
      坪田大队党总支的经验证明，用一揽子行政会议向下布置任务的工作方法，不是个好方法。因为这种方法不能很好地发挥党支部和党员的积极性；他们的经验还证明，撇开行政，事无大小，一概由支部和党员来做的工作方法，也不是个好方法，因为这种方法不能很好地发挥行政方面的积极性，有可能形成“包办代替”。现在，他们紧紧依靠党支部和党员，经常向群众进行细致的政治思想工作，注意发挥支部的战斗堡垒作用，从而加强了对生产队的具体领导，但不直接去抓具体事务，时时注意发扬民主，开展讨论，耐心听取群众意见。这种工作方法就是党的群众路线的工作方法，也是加强政治思想领导、避免“包办代替”的工作方法，各地公社的党委和党的总支可以学习。
