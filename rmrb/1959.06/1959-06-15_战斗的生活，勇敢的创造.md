Due to my work, I haven't been to the city to see performances for a long time. Last night, I steeled myself, put things aside for the time being, and went to see a performance by the Shenyang Military Region's amateur art troupe from the Second Army Arts Festival. I was very excited when I came back, and those vivid images kept lingering in my mind. I was still wondering, what exactly was it in those programs that attracted me?

I couldn't help but recall my feelings when I was working in the countryside last year. I remember last summer, right next to our village, a reservoir spanning ten or so li was quickly built. During the construction of the reservoir, there were really crowds of people, a lively and bustling scene. Red flags were everywhere during the day, and thousands of lights at night. The songs of ramming the earth were connected together. At that time, I was thinking: this soaring enthusiasm and magnificent scene should be artistically represented. In the dance "Night at the Reservoir" last night, I saw the ocean of lights and the shuttling crowds again. That boiling enthusiasm and the beauty of labor attracted me and all the audience. Perhaps some people think that this is just twisting Yangko and circling and changing formations on the stage; and putting many small lights on the edges of the earth baskets and wheels is somewhat unrealistic. But I think, perhaps we can say that such things are still some distance from the art of dance. However, it is a true new sprout of dance art. In this enthusiastic program, we not only saw the real experience of combat life, but also the courageous spirit of creation. It was those small lights that brought us to the night scene of the reservoir with thousands of lights, and it was also those small lights that set off the boiling labor enthusiasm. Whether you count it as dance or not, it doesn't matter. It is in this simple yet novel form that the soldiers reproduced the joy of labor and praised the glory of labor.

Let's look at their male and female choruses again. These are all works created or adapted by the soldiers themselves, some songs with performances. These programs are full of lively life atmosphere and optimistic emotions. Among them, a female chorus called "I Want to Sign Up to Be an Actor" imitated the expressions of different characters (little girl, old lady, young man, old man) and sang a section of Xiaoqin's solo from the opera "Xiao Erhei Gets Married," "Really Makes People Laugh," "Singing the People's Commune," and "Building a New Country," respectively. The chorus was just stringing them together. Everyone was very happy after watching it. They were welcomed to perform it again. I was thinking again: this form of small chorus with performances has been very popular among the masses in recent years. But among our musicians, there is often a view that this is not a "proper way" because it does not move the audience through music. Moreover, piecing together bits and pieces like this doesn't seem like a musical creation at all? However, as an audience member, I was deeply attracted by this program. In this program, I saw a brand-new life, a life full of optimistic sentiment and culture, a new life in which the wisdom and talents of the masses are given unprecedented play. At the same time, I was also attracted by their courageous spirit of creation. Perhaps this can only be regarded as a "music collection" or perhaps it can only be regarded as a "music performance." Whatever it is, why be拘泥in existing frameworks! Courageous creation, I think this is their characteristic.

The recitation poem "The Story of the Fireman" is truly a heart-stirring program. This is a hymn to heroes, narrating the heroic deeds of the volunteer soldiers who, in the sea of fire, sacrificed themselves to defend their positions and strike the enemy. In the sonorous, concise, and fire-like enthusiastic verses filled with lofty thoughts, it expressed the magnificent spirit of revolutionary heroism of the volunteer soldiers. This is a poem with performance, with both solo and collective recitations, and musical accompaniment. I have never seen such a form before. In order to perform such a heroic poem, they appropriately combined poetry, music, and performance, giving the audience a strong feeling. This is also a courageous creation.

Their Northeast Errenzhuan performance "Celebrating the National Day and Singing the Commune" also has new creations. It is no longer just two people turning around on the stage alone, but collective singing and dancing are added in addition to the two, which is also very appropriate for performing the joyous festive atmosphere.

From their performances, I deeply realized how important combat life is to artistic creation. If in today's artistic creation, we cannot see our motherland's thriving new life, and cannot see the spiritual outlook of the people of our new era, how boring it would be! Similarly, the courageous spirit of creation is also what we need to vigorously promote in our artistic creation. If our artistic creation is always circling in the existing formats, never daring to take a step beyond the boundaries, and the audience cannot gain some artistic feelings from the performance, and it is always the same old routine, it is also a disheartening thing.

Of course, it is not to say that their programs are completely successful. Naturally, their programs still have many shortcomings in terms of the degree of artistic processing. However, they are, after all, the creations of amateur enthusiasts, and one cannot be too demanding. We can clearly see that these programs have made significant progress compared to the programs of the 1952 Arts Festival.

    战斗的生活，勇敢的创造
    郭乃安
    由于工作的关系，好久没有进城去看演出了。昨晚，狠一下心，把事情暂时搁下，去看了一次全军第二届文艺会演沈阳部队业余文艺代表队的演出。回来后，很兴奋，那些生动活泼的形象总在我的头脑里萦回。我还在想，在那些节目中，究竟是一些什么东西吸引着我呢？
    我不由地回想起去年在乡下劳动时的感受来。记得去年夏天，就在我们村子边上，一个横竖十来里的平原水库很快地修起来了。在修水库的时候，真是人山人海，热火朝天。白日里红旗处处，到晚来明灯万盏。打夯的歌声，连成一片。那时我就在想：这冲天的干劲，壮丽的景象，应该得到艺术的表现。昨天晚上的舞蹈“水库的夜晚”中，我又看到了灯火的海洋，穿梭的人群。那沸腾的热情，劳动的壮美，吸引了我，也吸引了所有观众。也许有人看来，这不过是扭秧歌一般在台上绕圈子、变队形；而且把许多小灯装在土筐边、车轮上，未免有失真实。但是我想，或者可以说这样的东西和艺术的舞蹈还有距离。然而，它却是一种真正的舞蹈艺术的新芽。在这个热情洋溢的节目里，我们不但看到了战斗生活的真实体验，也看到了勇敢的创造精神。正是那些小灯，把我们带到了明灯万盏的水库夜景，也是那些小灯，衬托那沸腾的劳动热情。不管你把它算作舞蹈也好，不算作舞蹈也好。就在这朴素而又新颖的形式里，战士们再现了劳动的欢悦，歌颂了劳动的光荣。
    再看看他们的那些男声小合唱和女声小合唱吧。这都是战士们自己创作或改编的作品，一些带表演的歌曲。在这些节目里，充满了活泼的生活气息，乐观主义的情绪。其中有一首叫“我要报名当演员”的女声小合唱，由四个人摹拟不同人物（小姑娘、老太太、小伙子、老头子）的表情，分别演唱歌剧“小二黑结婚”的小芹独唱、“真是乐死人”、“歌唱人民公社”和“建设新国家”各一段，合唱则不过是将它们贯串起来而已。大家看了，都非常高兴。欢迎他们再表演了一次。我又在想了：带表演的小合唱这种形式，近年来在群众中很受欢迎。但是我们搞音乐的人中却常有一种看法，总觉得这不是一种“正道”，因为它不是靠音乐来感动观众。再像这样东一段、西一段地凑在一块，哪像个音乐创作呢？然而，作为一个观众的我，却被这个节目深深地吸引了。在这个节目里，我看到了一种崭新的生活，一种充满了乐观情调的、富有文化的生活，一种使群众的智慧和才能得到空前发挥的新生活。同时我也为他们的勇敢创造精神所吸引。或者这只能算是一种“音乐集锦”，抑或者只能算是一种“音乐表演”吧。无论算什么都行，何必拘泥在已有的框框里哩！勇敢地创造，我看这就是他们的特征。
    朗诵诗“火人的故事”真是一个动人心魄的节目。这是一首英雄的赞歌，它叙述了志愿军英雄们在火海中不惜牺牲自己坚守了阵地，打击了敌人的英雄事迹。在铿锵、洗练、充满崇高的思想和火样热情的诗句中，表达了志愿军战士的革命英雄主义的宏伟气魄。这是一首带表演的、有单人朗诵也有集体朗诵的诗篇，还有音乐伴奏。这样的形式，我过去是没有见过的。他们为了表演这样一首壮烈的英雄诗篇，把诗、音乐和表演恰当地结合在一起，给观众以强烈的感受。这也是一种勇敢的创造。
    他们演出的东北二人转“欢度国庆唱公社”也有新的创造。它已不是孤零零的两个人在台上转，而是在二人之外还加了集体的歌舞，这对表演欢乐的节日气氛也是很恰当的。
    从他们的演出节目里，使我深深体会到。战斗的生活，对于艺术的创造来说，是何等的重要。如果在今天的艺术创作里看不到我们祖国欣欣向荣的新生活，看不见我们新时代人民的精神面貌，该是多么没劲！同样的，勇敢的创造精神，也是我们的艺术创造中需要大力发扬的。如果我们的艺术创作总是在既有的格式打圈圈，永不敢越雷池一步，观众不能在演出中获得一些艺术感受，翻来复去老是那一套，也是泄气的事。
    当然，并不是说他们的节目就完全是成功的了。他们的节目从艺术加工的程度上来说，自然还有许多缺点。但是，他们毕竟是业余爱好者的创作，不能过分苛求的。我们可以明显地看出，这些节目比起1952年会演的节目来，进步是显著的。
