Xinhua News Agency, 28th: Beijing's vegetable supply in June has greatly increased compared to last month and the same period last year. According to statistics from the Beijing Vegetable Company, from June 1st to 25th, an average of more than 3.47 million jin of various vegetables were supplied to the city from the suburbs every day, an increase of more than 590,000 jin compared to May, and more than 270,000 jin compared to the same period last year.

Since the beginning of June, the people's communes in the near suburbs have made comprehensive arrangements for summer planting, summer harvesting, and vegetable marketing. On the one hand, they have strengthened field management and actively eliminated diseases and insect pests; on the other hand, they have allocated sufficient manpower and transportation capacity to harvest and transport vegetables to the market. The Nanyuan Commune, Lugouqiao Commune, Huangtugang Commune, and Sijiqing Commune, which mainly produce vegetables, have made vegetable marketing their central task, and each commune guarantees to supply the city with hundreds of thousands of jin of fresh vegetables every day. The people's communes in the far suburbs (counties) that grow vegetables have also overcome the difficulties of long-distance transportation and actively transported vegetables to the city.

In addition to strengthening contact with the communes and arranging marketing plans, the urban vegetable supply departments have also sent people and vehicles to the fields to help harvest and transport vegetables. The Tianqiao Vegetable Station dispatched 250 people-times in ten days to help harvest more than 100,000 jin of vegetables in the countryside. The Municipal Vegetable Company sent trucks to help various communes directly transport more than 360,000 jin of vegetables.

At present, summer planting in the suburbs is in full swing, and the peak vegetable season is also approaching. In order to ensure that both summer harvesting and planting and vegetable marketing are not delayed, many communes have made comprehensive arrangements for labor. The Xiaotun Brigade of the Lugouqiao Commune is a place with a large area of wheat planting in the vegetable area. They have arranged 500 people to be responsible for vegetable field management and organized vegetable marketing. The transportation force is divided into day and night shifts, hauling wheat during the day and delivering vegetables at night. The vegetable supply departments also ensure day and night acquisition and timely unloading. On the 25th of this month, the Municipal Vegetable Production Office also convened a meeting of cadres from the Municipal Vegetable Company, the Municipal Transportation Company, and various vegetable areas to comprehensively arrange the issue of transportation capacity, ensuring that the harvested vegetables are transported to the market in a timely manner.

    首都蔬菜旺季来到
    日夜收购及时运销
    新华社28日讯  北京6月份蔬菜供应量较上月和去年同期有很大的增长。据北京市蔬菜公司统计，从6月1日到25日，平均每天由郊区供应城市的各种蔬菜有三百四十七万多斤，比5月份多五十九万多斤，比去年同期多二十七万多斤。
    进入6月以来，近郊区的各人民公社对夏种夏收和蔬菜上市工作都作了全面安排，他们一方面加强田间管理，积极除治病虫害；一方面分配足够人力和运输力，收获和调运蔬菜上市。生产蔬菜为主的南苑公社芦沟桥公社、黄土岗公社、四季青公社等都把蔬菜上市作为当前的中心任务，每个公社每天都保证供应城市几十万斤新鲜蔬菜。远郊区各区（县）种菜的人民公社，也都克服长途运输的困难，给城市积极调运蔬菜。
    市区蔬菜供应部门，除了和各公社加强联系，安排上市计划以外，并且派人派车到田间帮助收割、调运蔬菜。天桥菜站在十天内出动了二百五十人次，下乡帮助收割蔬菜十万多斤，市蔬菜公司派汽车帮助各公社直接调运蔬菜三十六万多斤。
    现在郊区夏种正忙，蔬菜旺季也将到来，为了使夏收夏种和蔬菜上市两不误，很多公社都对劳动力作了全面安排。芦沟桥公社小屯大队是菜区种麦较多的地方，他们安排了五百人负责菜田管理，组织蔬菜上市；运输力分昼夜两班，白天拉麦，夜间送菜。蔬菜供应部门也做到日夜收购，及时卸车。本月25日，市蔬菜生产办公室又召集市蔬菜公司、市运输公司和各菜区的干部举行会议，全面安排了运输力的问题，保证把已经收获的蔬菜，及时运往市场。（附图片）
