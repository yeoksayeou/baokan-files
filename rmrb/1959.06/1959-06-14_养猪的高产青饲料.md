Cowpea (Chard)

Cowpea, also known as pig mother vegetable, thick-skinned vegetable, and Swiss chard, belongs to the same genus as beets, but instead of growing a large root, it grows a large number of leaves. It is widely cultivated in Sichuan, Guizhou, and Guangdong, and also grown in other regions. Its advantages are high yield, tenderness, juiciness, low fiber content, and pigs love to eat it, making it a high-quality green fodder for feeding pigs.

The harvest period of cowpea is very long. With good cultivation, it can be harvested for more than half a year, and the yield per unit area is very high. The cowpea grown at the Xianfeng Farm in Guangxi can yield more than 50,000 jin per mu. Cowpea grown in Sichuan generally yields about 20,000 jin per mu.

In South China, cowpea is generally planted in late autumn and used in winter and spring, which is precisely the time of year when green fodder for pig raising is most scarce. Planting cowpea can solve the problem of green fodder supply. With proper cultivation and management, planting one fen of cowpea is enough to provide green fodder for one pig.

Water Hyacinth

Water hyacinth belongs to the genus Pistia of the Araceae family, originally named Da Zao, also known as Da Ye Lian, Da Fu Ping, and is a freshwater plant. Water hyacinth prefers high-temperature and rainy regions and is abundant in freshwater ponds in the Pearl River Delta area of Guangdong Province. Its growth and propagation speed is extremely fast, and within a month, a single bud can propagate approximately sixty new plants.

Water hyacinth has a very high yield. In Guangdong, the annual yield per mu of pond surface can reach about 100,000 jin. In Jiangxi, Anhui, Henan, and other places, the annual yield per mu of pond surface can also reach 20,000 to 50,000 jin. The roots, stems, and leaves of water hyacinth are very tender, contain less fiber, and can all be used as pig feed or fertilizer.

Water hyacinth prefers to grow in warm, fertile, and still water.

Carrot

Carrot is also a high-yielding, nutritious, and juicy feed. Carrots contain a large amount of carbohydrates and are rich in Vitamin A. Because of its excellent effect on fattening pigs and other livestock, some people call it "fodder ginseng." Carrot leaves are also good feed, and many regions use them as raw materials for fermented feed.

Carrots are relatively cold-resistant and can be grown in both the south and the north. In the north, they are generally planted in summer and harvested in autumn, with a yield of about 5,000 jin per mu. In the south, they are planted in late autumn and harvested in late winter or the following spring, with a general yield of 3,000 to 4,000 jin per mu, and up to 6,000 to 7,000 jin with good growth.

Water Spinach

Water spinach, also known as revolution grass, belongs to the Lythraceae family and is a perennial plant with perennial roots. Water spinach has strong adaptability and can grow in water or on land, but it especially likes to grow in shallow water areas of lakes, rivers, and ponds.

Due to its fast propagation, high yield, good nutrition, great fertilizer effect, simple planting management, and non-occupation of land, people in Zhejiang and other places have been actively planting it in recent years for use as pig feed.

A mu of water surface planted with water spinach can generally produce 20,000 to 50,000 jin of grass, and in fertile water areas with good growth, it can reach 80,000 to 100,000 jin.

    养猪的高产青饲料
    牛皮菜
    牛皮菜又叫猪母菜、厚皮菜、莙达菜等，它和甜菜是同一属的植物，不过它不生长粗大的块根，而是长大量的叶子。四川、贵州和广东等地栽培很普遍，其他地区也有种植。它的优点是产量高，柔嫩多汁，纤维少，猪爱吃，是喂猪的上等青绿饲料。
    牛皮菜的收获期很长，种得好的，可连收半年以上，单位产量很高。广西先锋农场种的牛皮菜，每亩可收五万斤以上。四川栽的牛皮菜，一般每亩可以收到二万来斤。
    在华南一带，牛皮菜一般都在秋末栽种，冬春采用，这时正是一年中养猪青饲料最缺乏的时候，种了牛皮菜就可解决青饲料的供应问题。要是栽培管理得当，种一分地的牛皮菜，就够养一口猪的青饲料。
    水浮莲
    水浮莲是天南星科大藻属植物，原名大藻，又名大叶莲、大浮萍，是一种淡水生植物。水浮莲性喜高温多雨地区，盛产于广东省珠江三角洲一带淡水池塘里。生长增殖的速度非常快，一个月内可以由分芽增殖新植株约六十多株。
    水浮莲产量很高，在广东每亩塘面的年产量可达十万斤左右，在江西、安徽、河南等地，每亩塘面年产量也可达二万到五万斤。水浮莲的根、茎、叶都很柔嫩，含纤维质较少，全部可以作为猪饲料或肥料。
    水浮莲喜欢在温暖肥沃和静止的水上生长。
    胡萝卜
    胡萝卜也是一种单位产量高、营养好的多汁饲料。胡萝卜含有大量碳水化合物，还富有甲种维生素。由于它肥育猪等家畜的效果很好，有人叫它“饲料人参”。胡萝卜叶子也是好的饲料，不少地区把它作为发酵饲料的原料。
    胡萝卜比较耐寒，南方、北方都能种植。北方一般是夏种秋收，每亩能产五千斤左右。在南方，秋末种；冬末或次春收，每亩一般收三、四千斤，生长好的可到六、七千斤。
    水苋菜
    水苋菜又名革命草，属千屈菜科，是多年生宿根植物。水苋菜适应性强，可以在水里生长，也可以在陆地上生长，但特别喜欢生长在湖泊、河流、池塘的浅水地方。
    由于它繁殖快，产量高，营养好，肥效大，种植管理简易，又不占用土地，近几年浙江等地群众纷纷种植，用作喂猪的饲料。
    水苋菜一亩水面一般可产草二万到五万斤，肥沃水面生长得好的可达八万到十万斤。
