When dealing with a matter, the views of the majority are generally more correct and comprehensive than those of the minority. Therefore, when deciding on an issue, the minority usually defers to the majority. However, this does not mean that we only need to respect the opinions of the majority and do not need to consider the opinions of the minority. We should respect the opinions of the majority, and we should also take the opinions of the minority seriously. That is to say, when dealing with an opinion, whether it is put forward by the majority or the minority, we should adopt an analytical attitude; we should not blindly and without analysis think that as long as it is the majority's opinion, it must be correct, and that all minority opinions must be wrong.

The opinions of the minority are indeed not always wrong. In special circumstances, the opinions of the minority may be correct, while the opinions of the majority may be incorrect. Truth is often first discovered by a few people. When new things are still in the budding stage, they often fail to gain the recognition and support of the majority. Therefore, the opinions of the minority should be given special attention. In addition, sometimes the majority sees one aspect, while the minority sees another. Listening to the opinions of the minority can make the original opinions of the majority more comprehensive.

Su Yaoxian, the secretary of the Xianyang Municipal Party Committee, encountered a situation in Wuche Village where the opinions of the majority were correct, but the opinions of a few also reflected one aspect. When assessing the grades of the commune cadres, most people believed that the cadres had done many good things for everyone and should be given higher grades. However, an old man opposed everyone's opinion, saying that everyone was "assessing indiscriminately." Many people said that this old man liked to say strange things and should be ignored. However, Su Yaoxian, who attended the meeting, did not think so. He patiently listened to the old man express his opinions, which turned out to be that the old man had objections to the cadres' poor performance in labor. The municipal party committee promptly solved the problem of cadres' labor, and the masses were very satisfied. In this matter, the opinion of the majority was of course correct. The cadres did many good things for the masses, which was the main aspect of the problem. However, the poor performance of cadres in labor must also be noted. Sometimes, the opinions of the minority may not have touched on the main problem, or may be one-sided, but they may also remind everyone to pay attention to a certain aspect that the majority has not considered. As long as we carefully analyze and absorb the reasonable parts, it will be of great help to us in solving problems.

Even if the opinions of the minority are wrong, we should still listen patiently and conduct serious discussions and even debates. We often say that in discussing issues, we should establish an opposing viewpoint, the purpose of which is to allow the correct and incorrect opinions to fully clash, to reveal the contradictions more deeply, and to draw the line between right and wrong more clearly. This is an important guarantee for us to achieve unity in thought and action. At the same time, in the debate, correct opinions can be developed more thoroughly and perfectly, and the opinions of the minority can also be respected. In this way, we can cultivate a good atmosphere of independent thinking, adherence to the truth, and telling the truth. Otherwise, it may seem that only the opinions of the minority are not valued, but it will make everyone less willing to express opinions that are different from others, adhere to their own views, and some people may even echo others, repeat what others say, or not speak at meetings but talk nonsense behind their backs. This is very detrimental to our work.

    认真对待少数人的意见
    易槐
    对待一件事情，多数人的看法一般总比少数人的看法正确和全面。所以，在决定问题的时候，往往总是少数服从多数。但是，这决不是说只须尊重多数人的意见，而不必考虑少数人的意见。对多数人的意见要尊重，对少数人的意见同样要认真对待。也就是说，对待一种意见，不论它是多数人提出的，或是少数人提出的，都要采取分析的态度；不要盲目地不加分析，以为只要是多数人的主张就一定正确，凡是少数人的意见，就一定错误。
    少数人的意见的确不一定总是错误的。在特殊情况下，少数人的意见也会是正确的，多数人的意见倒会是不正确的。真理往往是为少数人所首先发现。新鲜事物还在萌芽状态的时候，也往往得不到多数人的承认和支持。因此，少数人的意见，也就要特别重视。此外，有时多数人看到了一个侧面，少数人却看到了另一个侧面。听取少数人的意见，就可使原来的多数人的意见更全面。
    咸阳市委书记苏耀先在五车村遇到的是多数人的意见正确，而个别人的意见也反映了一个侧面的情况。在给公社干部评定级别的时候，多数人认为干部替大家办了很多好事，应该把级别评高点。一位老汉却反对大家的意见，说大家是“混评”。很多人都说这位老汉爱说怪话，不要管他。参加会议的苏耀先却不是这样。他耐心地听老汉发表自己的意见，原来是这位老汉对干部劳动不好有意见。市委就抓紧解决了干部劳动的问题，群众非常满意。在这件事情上，多数人的意见当然是对的。干部为群众办了许多好事，这是问题的主要方面。但是，干部劳动不好，也必须引起注意。有时，少数人的意见，可能没有接触到主要问题，可能提得片面，可是也会提醒大家注意多数人所没有考虑到的某个侧面，只要认真分析，吸取其中合理的部分，这对我们解决问题就大有帮助。
    少数人的意见，如果是错误的，但同样也要耐心地听，认真地进行讨论以至争辩。我们常说，讨论问题要树立对立面，目的就在于使正确的和错误的意见充分交锋，把矛盾揭发得更加深刻，是非的界限划分得更加分明。这是使我们在思想和行动上取得一致的重要保证。同时，在辩论中，正确的意见也可以发展得更加周密完善，少数人的意见也同样受到尊重。这样，就能够培养独立思考、坚持真理、说老实话的好风气。否则，看起来不被重视的只是少数人的意见，但会使大家不大敢于发表和别人不同的意见，坚持自己的主张，甚至会有一些人随声附和，人云亦云，或者是会上不讲，背后乱讲。这对我们的工作是很不利的。
