Grasping the Key to Increasing Cotton Production

The people's growing need for cotton cloth and the development of the textile industry require us to make the greatest efforts to increase cotton production. To ensure an increase in the total cotton production, we must do a good job in these two aspects: first, guarantee the cotton planting area; second, strengthen the field management of cotton.

At present, the cotton sowing work in various parts of our country has ended one after another. The quality of the sowing work has been improved compared with previous years, and most of the cotton fields have good emergence and strong seedlings. However, according to preliminary statistics, the cotton planting area this year is about the same as last year, while the total cotton production is required to increase significantly. This requires us to earnestly do a good job in ensuring increased cotton production.

In guaranteeing the cotton planting area, there are currently two major tasks to be done: one is to try to reduce the abandonment of cotton fields and strive to plant one mu and harvest one mu; the other is to quickly check seedlings and replant seedlings to strive for one mu to be as good as one mu. In previous years, in some areas, there has been a phenomenon of destroying cotton fields where cotton seedlings grow poorly and replanting them with food crops. In fact, cotton seedlings that grow poorly can be improved with appropriate fertilization and watering. Abandoning one point of cotton field will increase the difficulty of increasing total production by several points. As for food, of course, it is important; cotton, why is it not important? Eating and dressing are the two greatest needs of the people, and neither is dispensable. The socialist economy is a whole. The state has entrusted the glorious task of producing cotton to the people of the cotton-producing areas. If the task of the cotton-producing areas cannot be completed, it will be detrimental to the development of the entire social and economic construction and the improvement of the people's lives; if the task is completed well, it will be a major contribution to the country and the people of the whole country. The state has always guaranteed a reasonable supply of food needed by the people in the cotton-growing areas, and the cotton-grain price ratio set is also reasonable. Only by placing the primary emphasis on striving to increase cotton production in the cotton-growing areas can it be in line with the interests of the people of the whole country and the interests of the people of the cotton-growing areas. This year, the total number of spindles in China's cotton textile industry will increase a lot, which is a major event related to the improvement of the lives of the people of the whole country. In order to ensure that the national cotton textile industry obtains sufficient raw materials, it is necessary to maintain the cotton planting area, and the "three types of seedlings" must be carefully processed, and must not be easily destroyed and replanted; at the same time, we must continue to work hard in terms of drought prevention, flood prevention, and insect prevention to prevent the cotton fields from being reduced due to disasters in the future. When thinning and setting seedlings, we must strive to achieve rational close planting in order to make full use of land and other natural conditions. In addition, we must strive for full seedlings. If one seedling is missing, it must be replanted. It can be calculated that it does not seem like much to be missing ten seedlings in a point of land, but if all the areas with missing seedlings are added up, it is equivalent to reducing a large amount of planting area. The opportunity is fleeting, and this work must be grasped tightly and must not be regarded as a trivial matter.

On the basis of preserving the area and preserving the full seedlings, we must strive to increase the yield per unit area. Of course, many measures taken to protect the area and protect the full seedlings are inseparable from increasing the yield per unit area. Vigorously promoting the upgrading of the "three types of seedlings" is not only to ensure the planting area, but also to increase the yield per unit area. However, in order to increase the yield per unit area, there is still a lot of work to be done, and a series of intense battles must be carried out throughout the entire growth period of cotton.

The growth and development of cotton have its special laws, which are different from other gramineous plants. It takes twenty to twenty-five days from budding to flowering, and fifty to sixty days from flowering to boll formation to spitting lint; it starts budding and flowering from the first node of the first fruit branch in the lower part, and goes up branch by branch and node by node in sequence, and it takes more than three months for the uppermost fruit branch to flower and bear fruit. Among them, the cotton bolls formed by the middle fruit branches are the largest, and the fiber quality is the best. This part of the cotton bolls is formed during the summer heat period, so it is called "Fu Tao" (summer bolls), which can mature and spit lint before severe frost, which is also what the masses call "Zhong Pen Hua" (middle spray flowers). The cotton bolls formed before the summer heat are called "Fu Qian Tao" (pre-summer bolls). The earlier and more the bolls are formed, the more beneficial it is, because this can make the cotton plants develop evenly, and each plant grows tightly, and the growth is stable and not rapid. It is not easy to grow wildly after adding water and fertilizer, and it can win more time to form bolls. The cotton bolls formed after the summer heat are called "Qiu Tao" (autumn bolls). Although the quality is not as good as "Fu Tao," in order to strive to increase production, we should also strive to form more. Therefore, according to the growth law of cotton, the way to strive to increase the yield per unit area is to vigorously promote the early development, early flowering, early boll formation, and more boll formation of cotton seedlings for pre-summer bolls; make the greatest efforts to strive to form more summer bolls; and then, on the basis of preserving the summer bolls, strive to form more autumn bolls.

The period of cotton flowering and fruiting is more than three months, and the duration is relatively long, which has both advantages and disadvantages for management. The advantage is that there are many opportunities for flowering and fruiting, and there is relatively sufficient time to do the field management work very carefully. As long as the field management work is closely linked, it is possible to make cotton as much as possible to bud, flower, boll, and spit lint. Compared with other gramineous plants, this is undoubtedly a favorable condition for increasing production. However, "every advantage has a disadvantage." Precisely because the process of budding and flowering of cotton lasts for a long time, it is relatively easy to encounter various unfavorable factors during this long period. Such as temperature changes, insufficient light, pest and disease damage, unbalanced fertilizer and water, etc., will cause flower buds and small bells (young bolls) to fall off. The summer heat period is the most prosperous period for flowering and boll formation, and the fiber quality of the bolls formed during this period is also the best; however, precisely during the summer heat period, the shedding rate of buds and bells is often the highest, often reaching more than 70%. If the shedding rate can be reduced, the potential for increasing cotton production is very large. Because the high shedding rate of buds and bells is not a necessary phenomenon. As long as the various factors affecting the shedding of buds and bells can be controlled, it is possible to make every flower bud flower, boll, and spit lint. Even if it cannot be completely controlled, as long as the shedding rate of buds and bells can be reduced to below 50%, the average yield per unit area can be doubled compared with the past. It seems that preventing the shedding of buds and bells and striving to form more summer bolls is the most important link in increasing cotton yield per unit area at present.

How to prevent the shedding of buds and bells? We must focus on regulating fertilizer, water, temperature, and light, in accordance with the law of cotton growth and development, and strengthen field management from fertilization, watering, drainage, cultivation, and pruning, etc., according to local conditions and in accordance with the timing; and we must create a good growth environment for cotton from the seedling stage and maintain a healthy "body." Preventing pests and diseases is also very important. If prevention is done well, it can reduce the shedding of buds and bells. Therefore, we should prepare insecticidal drugs and machinery, strengthen forecasting and early warning, organize collaborative joint prevention, and attack skillfully and forcefully at the right time.

The period of cotton flowering and fruiting is relatively long, and management work also needs to pay special attention to timeliness and refinement. The most important period of cotton field management is also the busy season of summer harvest and summer planting. Therefore, the people's communes in the cotton-growing areas must make a thorough and reasonable arrangement of the existing labor force, and the party and government leading organs at all levels must vigorously help the people's communes to support agricultural production with the labor force that can be drawn out and should be drawn out from other aspects. Most areas must implement the policy of focusing on agricultural production, rationally arrange the labor force in accordance with this policy, and actively reform tools to improve labor efficiency.

In order to promote the strengthening of cotton field management, it is also necessary to carry out appraisal competitions, boost morale, and strive for large-scale high yields. At present, in most cotton-growing areas, it is the cotton budding period. The communes and production teams in the cotton-growing areas can calculate a boll protection account based on the cotton yield per unit area index, that is: how many plants are planted per mu, how many cotton bolls can harvest one catty of seed cotton, how many cotton bolls are required to be formed per mu, how many cotton bolls are formed on average per plant, of which how many are pre-summer bolls, summer bolls, and autumn bolls. With such an account, the goal can be clarified, and appraisal competitions with the main content of early formation of pre-summer bolls and more formation of summer bolls can be carried out seasonally, striving to form more pre-summer bolls and ensure the complete victory of summer bolls!

    抓住棉花增产的关键
    人民对棉布需要的增长和纺织工业的发展，要求尽最大努力提高棉花产量。为了确保提高棉花的总产量，要做好这两方面工作：一、保证棉花的种植面积；二、加强棉花的田间管理。
    现在，我国各地的棉花播种工作已经先后结束。播种工作的质量比往年已有所提高，绝大部分棉田出苗良好、幼苗茁壮。但是，据初步统计，今年的棉花播种面积和去年差不多，而棉花的总产量却要求大大提高。这就要求我们切实做好保证棉花增产的工作。
    在保证棉花种植面积方面，当前还有两项重大的工作要做：一是尽力减少棉田废弃，力争种一亩收一亩；二是赶快查苗补苗，力争有一亩顶一亩。历年在一些地区都有毁弃棉苗生长较差的棉田、改种粮食作物的现象。其实，棉苗生长较差的，只要适当加肥、加水，还是可以好转的。废弃一分棉田，对总产量的提高就要增加几分困难。至于粮食，固然是重要的；棉花，又何尝不重要？吃和穿是人民生活的两个最大的需要，缺一不可。社会主义经济是一个整体。国家把生产棉花的光荣任务交给了棉产区的人民。棉产区的任务如果不能完成，就不利于整个社会经济建设的发展和人民生活的改善；任务如果完成得好，对国家和全国人民都是重大的贡献。国家从来对棉区人民所需要的粮食是保证合理供应的，所定的棉粮比价也是合理的。棉区只有把力争增产棉花放在首要地位，才符合全国人民的利益，也才符合棉区人民的利益。今年我国棉纺织工业纱锭总数将要增加很多，这是有关全国人民生活改善的一件大事。为了确保全国棉纺织工业获得足够的原料，必须保持棉花种植面积，对“三类苗”要精心加工，决不要轻易毁弃改种；同时，还要从防旱、防涝、防虫等方面继续努力，防止以后因受灾而缩减棉田。在间苗、定苗的时候，要力求作到合理密植，以求充分利用土地和其它自然条件。此外，还要力求全苗，缺一棵苗就要补上一棵。可以计算一下，一分地缺十棵苗，看来不算什么，如果把所有缺苗的面积加起来，就等于减少了大量的种植面积。时机稍纵即逝，对这个工作必须抓紧，切不可当成小事。
    在保住了面积、保住了全苗的基础上，要力争提高单位面积产量。当然，为保面积、保全苗而采取的许多措施，同提高单位产量是不可分的。力促“三类苗”升级，既是为了确保种植面积，也是为了提高单位产量。不过，为了提高单位产量，还有许多工作要做，要在棉花的整个生长期间进行一连串紧张的战斗。
    棉花的生长发育，有它的特殊规律，和其它禾本科植物不同。它从现蕾到开花要经过二十天到二十五天，从开花到结桃到吐絮要经过五十天到六十天；从下部第一个果枝第一节开始现蕾开花，逐枝逐节顺序而上，到最上部果枝开花结果，要延续三个月以上的时间。其中以中部果枝结的棉桃最大，纤维质量最好。这一部分棉桃是在暑伏期间结的，所以叫做“伏桃”，能在严霜以前成熟吐絮，也就是群众所说的“中喷花”。暑伏以前结的棉桃叫“伏前桃”。结桃越早越多也越有利，因为这样可以使棉株发育均衡，棵棵长得紧凑，生长稳而不猛。以后加水加肥也不易疯长，而且可以赢得多结桃的时间。暑伏以后结的棉桃叫做“秋桃”，虽然质量不如“伏桃”好，但为了力求提高产量，也还应该力争多结。因此，按照棉花的生长规律，争取提高单位产量的办法就是：力促棉苗早发育、早开花、早结和多结伏前桃；尽最大努力争取多结伏桃；然后在保住伏桃的基础上，再争取多结秋桃。
    棉花开花结果的时期有三个月以上，持续的时间比较长，这对于经营管理有有利和不利两个方面。有利的方面就是开花结果的机会多，有比较充分的时间把田间管理工作做得很细致。只要把田间管理工作环环扣紧，就有可能使棉花尽可能多地着蕾、开花、结桃、吐絮。这同其它禾本科植物相比，无疑是一个增产的有利条件。但是，“有一利必有一弊”，正因为棉花着蕾、开花的过程要延续很久，在这较长的时间里，就比较容易碰到各种不利的因素。如气温变化、光照不足、病虫为害、肥水不调等等，都会使花蕾和小铃（幼桃）脱落。暑伏期间是开花结桃最盛的时期，这时期结的桃的纤维质量也最好；可是，正是在暑伏期间，蕾铃脱落率往往最高，常达70％以上。如果能够降低脱落率，提高棉花产量的潜力是很大的。因为，蕾铃脱落率高，并不是一种必然的现象。只要能把影响蕾铃脱落的各种因素都控制住，就有可能使每一个花蕾都开花、结桃、吐絮。即使不能完全控制，只要能把蕾铃脱落率降低到50％以下，平均单位产量就能比过去提高一倍左右。这样看来，防止蕾铃脱落，力争多结伏桃，是目前提高棉花单位产量的最要紧的环节。
    怎样防止蕾铃脱落呢？必须针对棉花生长发育的规律，以调剂肥、水、温、光为中心，因地制宜，因时制宜，从施肥、浇水、排涝、中耕、整枝等方面加强田间管理；而且要从幼苗期开始就给棉花创造良好的生长环境，保有健壮的“身体”。防治病虫害也是很要紧的，防止得好就可以减少蕾铃脱落。因此，应该准备治虫药械，加强预测预报，组织协作联防，适时猛攻巧打。
    棉花开花结果的时期比较长，管理工作也需要特别注意及时和精细。棉田管理最重要的时期，又正是夏收夏种的农忙季节。因此，棉区各人民公社必须把现有的劳动力作周密的合理的安排，各地党政领导机关要大力帮助人民公社，把其它方面可以抽出、应当抽出的劳动力支援农业生产。多数地区必须贯彻执行以农业生产为主的方针，按照这个方针合理安排劳动力，并积极改革工具，提高劳动效率。
    为了推动加强棉田的管理，还要开展评比竞赛，鼓足干劲，力争大面积丰产。当前在大部分棉区正是棉花现蕾时期。棉区的公社和生产队都可以根据棉花单位面积产量指标算一笔保桃账，即：每亩种植多少株，多少个棉桃可收获一斤籽棉，每亩共要求结多少棉桃，平均每株要结多少棉桃，其中伏前桃、伏桃、秋桃各是多少个。有了这样一笔账，就可使奋斗目标明确，按季节开展以早结伏前桃和多结伏桃为主要内容的评比竞赛，争取多结伏前桃和确保伏桃的完全胜利！
