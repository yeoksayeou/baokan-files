Xinhua News Agency, Paris, June 20th: The 32nd Congress of the French General Confederation of Labor (CGT), after a six-day meeting, concluded on the afternoon of the 19th. The Congress unanimously adopted a "Letter to Workers" and, by an absolute majority, approved Frachon's report and the CGT's program of action for the next two years. On the final day of the meeting, the Congress elected the CGT's leadership.

The report by Frachon, adopted at the meeting on the 18th, established the CGT's policy. The report opposed any preconditions for the issue of trade union unity proposed by other trade union organizations, such as the National Education Federation's demand that the CGT, in principle, recognize "factional" organizations in advance. The vast majority of delegates who spoke during the discussion pointed out that this precondition, advocated by Lebrun (CGT Secretary), Roux, Baster, and several other representatives, was unacceptable. Frachon's report clearly affirmed this position.

Frachon's report reiterated the proposal for unified action to the "Workers' Force" trade union, the French Confederation of Christian Workers, the General Confederation of Civil Servants, and the independent National Education Federation.

The "Letter to Workers" adopted by the Congress called on workers to support the proposals made by the CGT to the "Workers' Force" trade union, the French Confederation of Christian Workers, the National Education Federation, and the General Confederation of Civil Servants, thereby achieving complete unity of action from the bottom up.

The "Letter to Workers" pointed out that only the unified action of all workers in the same enterprise, the same industry, and the same region can give the mass struggle an invincible force.

The "Letter to Workers" called on workers to fight for the following demands: universal increase in wages, annuities, and pensions; abolition of decrees detrimental to social insurance; an increase in family allowances to 20%; and opposition to layoffs.

The "Letter to Workers" also called on workers to unite to achieve peace in Algeria through an immediate ceasefire and negotiations; to achieve peace in Europe and the world by resolving all international disputes through negotiation; and to re-establish genuine democracy.

At the meeting on the 19th, the CGT's leadership was elected. Benoît Frachon was re-elected as General Secretary of the French General Confederation of Labor. The following were elected as secretaries: Marcel Caille, Madeleine Colin, Germain Ghièle, Lucien Jallais, Pierre Le Brun, Léon Mauvais, André Maugé, Gaston Monmousseau, Henri Raynaud, and Jean Schaeffer.

    法国总工会代表大会向工人发出号召
    争取统一行动　加强斗争力量
    新华社巴黎20日电　法国总工会第三十二次代表大会经过六天会议以后，已经在19日下午闭幕。代表大会一致通过“告工人书”，并且以绝对多数通过了弗拉商的报告和总工会在今后两年内的活动纲领，在最后一天会议上，大会选出了总工会的领导机构。
    在18日会议上通过的弗拉商的报告确立了法国总工会的方针，报告反对其他工会组织提出的有关工会统一问题的任何先决条件，例如全国教育联合会要求总工会在原则上事先承认“派别”组织。绝大多数代表在讨论中发言指出，这个为勒布伦（总工会书记）、鲁佐、巴斯特以及其他若干代表所主张的先决条件，是不能接受的。弗拉商报告明确肯定了这一立场。
    弗拉商的报告再次向“工人力量”总工会、天主教工人联合会、公务员总工会以及独立的全国教育联合会提出统一行动的建议。
    大会通过的“告工人书”号召工人们支持总工会向“工人力量”总工会、天主教工人联合会以及全国教育联合会、公务员总工会提出的建议，从而做到自下至上的完全统一的行动。
    “告工人书”指出，只有同一企业、同一行业、同一地区的全体工人的统一行动，才能使群众斗争拥有不可战胜的力量。
    “告工人书”号召工人们争取下列权利要求：普遍增加工资、年金、退休金；废除有损社会保险的法令；增加家庭补助金使之达到20％；反对解雇。
    “告工人书”还号召工人们团结起来，以争取通过立即停火和通过谈判来实现阿尔及利亚和平；通过谈判解决一切国际争端来实现欧洲和世界和平；重新建立真正的民主。
    19日的会议上选举了总工会领导机构，贝诺瓦·弗拉商重新当选为法国总工会总书记；当选书记的有下列各人：马赛尔·卡伊、马德兰娜·柯兰、歇曼·纪耶、吕西恩·叶雅、皮埃尔·勒布伦、莱昂·摩维、安德烈·麦洛、加斯东·蒙慕梭、亨利·雷诺、让·谢菲尔。
