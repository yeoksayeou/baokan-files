    Editor's Note: A recent issue of the American weekly "The Nation" published an article entitled "Poverty, Pride, and Backwardness," reporting on the poverty of millions of working people in the southern Appalachian Mountains. This region includes nine states from West Virginia to Alabama. The following is an excerpt from that article:
    In our free land, there are ragged, barefoot children. They are the children of the superfluous "country folk" - the miners. These miners are being squeezed out by machines and are forced to eke out a living on surplus food issued by the government and relief agencies.
    "Children, raise your hands if your father has a job," a schoolteacher said to her students.
    Only thirteen out of thirty students raised their hands.
    Suffering abounds in these hills and valleys. The school is located in Caretta-Coallick. The children's fathers fought bloody battles from 1912 to 1921 to fight for miners' rights.
    But now, the suffering seems even deeper.
    "No matter which valley you look at, you will find people who are hungry and unemployed," said George Cook, the manager of the Siddall-Glover Funeral Home. Siddall-Glover is a mining town with a population of 1,500. Cook pointed to the five or six people sweeping the streets and said, "See? We have a municipal water company, and these people are sweeping the streets to pay for their water bills. We are at our wit's end. Our only way out is the mines, but these mines have been closed and the miners laid off. The situation is much worse than many people think!"
    Caretta-Coallick's poverty is a common phenomenon in the many independent hills winding through the southern Appalachian Mountains. According to statistics, eight million people live in this increasingly impoverished area. They barely make a living by farming small plots of land or by logging the region's barren forests. The number of people employed in mines is decreasing day by day...
    Poverty is everywhere in the southern Appalachian Mountains. In 1949, more than 60% of the families and single people living in two-thirds of the region had an annual income of less than $2,000. The average net income of farm tenants engaged only in agriculture was less than $500. This year, unemployment in West Virginia has increased to 15%, and 300,000 people (one-sixth of the state's population) are partially or completely dependent on "fodder" - the local term for government-rationed food. Many unemployed people have now lost their right to receive unemployment benefits.
    In a small department store in Caretta-Coallick, "Danbar & Sons," there is a poster written in pencil: "Donations for Mollie Yorkman." Mollie is an elderly woman. She lives with her daughter and her daughter's five children in a small shack near the store. When we went to see her, Mollie was lying down. "We have nothing to eat," she said.
    On the thin walls of the simple room hung pictures of Jesus Christ and his disciples. These were cut out from popular religious calendars in the mountains. In the adjoining small room, a baby wrapped in dirty rags was lying. When he cried, the bones on his head were exposed, and the skin on his thin, gaunt face was drawn tight.
    Raoulf Keenan is a pastor in Siddall-Glover and also the owner of a gas station. He stuck his head out of the car, scratched his white hair, and said, "The situation is extremely bad now. Despite charitable relief, people are still not getting enough to eat, and if we don't find a way, people will have to steal."
    Since 1950, the number of people employed in mines in this region has shrunk by at least 50%. The number of miners in West Virginia, the state with the highest bituminous coal production in the United States, has decreased from approximately 125,000 in 1948 to the current 47,000.
    These "poor, proud, and backward" people seem to yearn for the cities in the prosperous areas of America that they have heard about, because their hometown only promises them a bleak future and poverty. They flock to the North, hoping to find a way out in industry. When their hopes are dashed in Chicago or Cleveland, they pack their bags and return home, tighten their belts, and begin to live on relief or government "fodder," trying to survive this period of recession.
    The southern Appalachian Mountains remain a backward area. Its residents cannot understand: what exactly do they count for in the complex twentieth century?

### 在美国南部的山区里

专栏：外论摘要

    在美国南部的山区里
    编者按：最近一期美国“民族”周刊，发表了一篇题为“贫穷、骄傲与落后”的文章，报道美国阿巴拉契亚山南部数百万劳动人民的贫困状况。这个地区包括从西弗吉尼亚到亚拉巴马的九个州。兹将该文摘译如下：
    在我们的自由国土里，有着衣衫褴褛、赤脚的儿童。他们是多余的“乡下人”——矿工们——的孩子。这些矿工被机器所排挤，不得不勉强依靠政府与救济机关颁发的剩余粮食苟延残喘。
    “孩子们，谁的爸爸有工作，谁就举起手来。”一个学校的女教员向她的学生们说。
    三十个学生中只有十三个人举了手。
    在这些山丘与山谷里，到处苦难重重。学校设在凯里斯—克利克。孩子们的父亲曾于1912年至1921年为了争取矿工的权利、进行过流血的斗争。
    但是，现在，苦难似乎更深重了。
    “无论你到哪一个山谷里去看看，就会发现饥饿和失业的人”，西达尔—格鲁弗城殡仪馆的经理乔治·库克说。西达尔—格鲁弗是一个拥有一千五百名居民的矿山城。库克随手指着打扫街道的五、六个人说：“你看见吗？我们有市立自来水公司，这些人打扫街道为的是抵偿水费。我们走投无路。我们唯一的出路是矿井，但是这些矿井又被封闭了，矿工被解雇。情况比许多人想像的坏多了！”
    在蜿蜒于阿巴拉契亚山南部的许多独立的山丘中，凯里斯—克利克的贫困是常见的现象。据统计，在这个日益贫穷化的地区里，居住着八百万人。他们依靠耕种小块土地勉强维持生活、或者靠采伐这一地区的贫瘠的林木为生。在矿井就业的人日益减少了……
    阿巴拉契亚山南部到处是一片贫困。1949年在这个山区三分之二的地区居住的居民中，有60％以上的家庭和单身人的全年收入还不到两千美元。只从事农业的农场佃户的平均纯收入还不到五百美元。今年，西弗吉尼亚的失业人口增加到15％，有三十万人（占全州人口六分之一）部分地或完全依靠“饲料”过活——“饲料”是当地人对政府配给的粮食的称呼。许多失业的人，现在已经丧失了领取失业经费的权利。
    在凯里斯—克利克的一家小百货商店“丹巴尔父子商店”里，贴着一张用铅笔书写的招贴：“为摩丽·约克曼募捐”。摩丽是一个上了年纪的妇女。她与女儿及女儿的五个孩子住在商店附近的一间小茅屋里。当我们去看她的时候，摩丽正躺着。“我们没有东西吃。”她说。
    在简陋的房间的薄薄的墙壁上，悬挂着耶稣基督和他的门徒的画像。这是从山区流行的宗教日历上剪下来的。在毗连的一间小房里，躺着一个用肮脏的破皮包裹着的婴儿。当他啼哭的时候，头上的骨胳就显露出来，在他那细长、瘦削的脸上，皮肤也紧缩起来。
    劳尔弗·凯南是西达尔—格鲁弗城的一个牧师，又是一个汽油站的老板。他把头从汽车里伸出来，用手搔着白头发说：“现在的情况已经坏到极点了。尽管有慈善救济，人们还是吃不饱，如果不想办法，人们只得去偷窃。”
    自从1950年以来，这一地区的矿井的就业人数至少缩减了50％。烟煤产量占美国第一位的西弗吉尼亚的矿工人数大约从1948年的十二万五千人减少到目前的四万七千人。
    这些“贫穷、骄傲与落后”的人，似乎憧憬着他们从传闻中听说的美国繁华地区的都市，因为他们的故乡所应许他们的只是苦闷的前途与贫困。他们投奔北方，希望在工业中去谋出路。当他们的希望在芝加哥或克利夫兰遭到破灭的时候，他们就束装返乡、勒紧裤带，开始依靠救济或政府的“饲料”过活，企图捱过这个萧条的时期。
    阿巴拉契亚山南部仍旧是落后的地区。它的居民无法理解：在错综复杂的二十世纪里，他们究竟算什么？
