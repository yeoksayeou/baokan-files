Where There is Engineering, There is Learning
Changchun Municipal Engineering Office Runs Spare-Time Education According to Production Characteristics

(Xinhua News Agency dispatch) The Changchun City Construction Bureau's Municipal Engineering Office is carrying out spare-time education for its employees based on the characteristics of municipal engineering production. They have basically ensured that wherever there is an engineering project, there is a learning organization, so that employee education can be carried out smoothly. The engineering office's engineering teams and affiliated factories have established thirteen teaching locations, offering forty-eight classes ranging from literacy and spare-time elementary school to spare-time middle school and specialized courses, with more than 1,400 employees enrolled, accounting for 92.3% of the total number of eligible employees.

At the end of last year, the engineering office's Party committee strengthened its leadership over employee spare-time education, researched and analyzed the problems existing in employee education, and adopted some new measures closely combined with the production characteristics of the unit. First, education and production are closely integrated, establishing a top-down, centralized to decentralized spare-time education network. A staff spare-time school is established at the office level, which is responsible not only for running intermediate and professional classes for employees, but also for guiding the schooling work of grassroots units. At the same time, branch schools were established in the four engineering teams and three affiliated factories directly under the engineering office, with dedicated personnel responsible for leading the study work; teaching locations were established at various decentralized construction sites, and study groups were formed based on production teams, implementing the method of "organizing learning on the spot, with the construction site as the classroom," using construction sites, dormitories, canteens, and offices as classrooms for learning.

In order to expand the teaching staff, in addition to hiring full-time teachers, a group of workers with higher levels of education were selected for training to concurrently serve as teaching staff at various construction sites. Now the entire engineering office has ensured that wherever the engineering project moves, the learning follows; wherever there are employees, there are teachers. Employees carry books with them and make full use of spare time to study. When workers are transferred between engineering teams, transfer procedures are handled at any time, so that workers can participate in learning in a timely manner after arriving at the new construction site.

### 哪里有工程　哪里有学习  长春市政工程处根据生产特点办业余教育

    哪里有工程　哪里有学习
    长春市政工程处根据生产特点办业余教育
    据新华社讯　长春市建设局市政工程处根据市政工程生产特点开展职工业余教育，基本上作到哪里有工程，哪里就有学习组织，使职工教育顺利开展。工程处所属各工程队、附属厂已建立了十三个授课点，开设了从扫盲、业余高小到业余中学和专业等四十八个班级，有一千四百多名职工入学学习，占可入学职工总数的92.3％。
    去年年底，工程处党委加强了对职工业余教育的领导，研究和分析了职工教育中存在的问题，紧密结合本单位生产特点，采取了一些新的措施。首先，把教育和生产密切结合起来，建立一套由上到下、由集中到分散的业余教育网，在处一级设立职工业余学校，除负责办好职工学习中级班和专业班外，并负责指导基层单位的办学工作。同时，在工程处直属的四个工程队和三个附属厂建立分校，有专人负责领导学习工作；在各个分散的工地建立授课点，以生产组为单位组成学习组，实行“就地组织学习，工地就是课堂”的办法，利用工地、宿舍、食堂、办公室做课堂，进行学习。
    为了扩大师资队伍，除聘请专职教师外，还选拔了一批文化较高的工人进行培训，分别兼任各工地的教学工作。现在全工程处已做到工程搬到哪里，学习就跟到哪里；哪里有职工，哪里就有教师。职工随身带书本，尽量利用空隙时间学习。各工程队之间互相调动工人时，都随时办理转学手续，使工人到新工地后，能够及时参加学习。
