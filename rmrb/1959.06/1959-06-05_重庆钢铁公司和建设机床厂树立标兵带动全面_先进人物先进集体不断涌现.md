Chongqing, June 4 (report from our newspaper) Chongqing Steel Company and Construction Machine Tool Factory have adopted the method of grasping the advanced elements and planting red flags to vigorously promote the mass movement. A large number of advanced collectives and advanced figures have continuously emerged, effectively promoting a surge in production and steadily increasing product quality and output.

In each production campaign, the various factories of Chongqing Steel Company pay attention to cultivating advanced collectives and individuals in a timely manner and establishing red flags. In the past year, the company has produced more than 110 advanced collectives and more than 1,500 advanced figures. In the first quarter of this year, during the upsurge of formulating leap forward plans, carrying out the high-quality and high-yield movement centered on attacking sulfur, and the ongoing establishment of a mass responsibility system, nearly 100 advanced collectives and more than 1,000 advanced individuals emerged again. At the beginning of the year, when formulating plans, the company leaders first focused on advanced producers Huang Rongchang, Zhang Wenjin, Ma Haiqing, and others, and formulated leap forward plans. Then, using them as pace-setters, they launched a company-wide upsurge to catch up with and surpass the advanced in discussing and formulating leap forward plans.

In the first quarter of this year, Liao Shigang, a technical innovation expert at Chongqing Construction Machine Tool Factory, continuously realized more than 60 major technical innovations. The Clever Girls Group of Workshop 25 completed the equivalent of the entire year's workload in two months and seven days. The factory Party committee promptly seized these two advanced models and called on all factory workers to launch a vigorous competition movement of men catching up with Liao Shigang and women catching up with the Clever Girls Group. After the factory-wide pace-setters were established, each unit also established pace-setters at each level and in each category, extensively organizing and mobilizing the masses to learn from them and catch up with them. In this way, the factory quickly saw a large-scale mass movement centered on technical innovation. In the past three months, employees have put forward more than 100,000 technical innovation proposals. More than 600 Liao Shigang-style technical innovation experts have emerged in the factory. At present, there are more than 4,200 advanced figures in the factory. Since the female workers enthusiastically launched a competition to catch up with the Clever Girls Group of Workshop 25, 367 people have been named Clever Girls. Driven by advanced figures, advanced collectives in the factory have also continued to increase, and many advanced units with large-area high yields have emerged. There are currently 38 advanced collectives in the factory. Workshop 35, with a significant increase in tasks, originally lacked 200 laborers. However, by grasping the advanced elements, planting red flags, and fully carrying out technical innovation and other methods, it not only did not increase workers, but also transferred dozens of people to support other workshops. In order to disseminate the advanced experience of advanced figures in a timely manner, the factory has organized 76 technical seed-spreading teams since February, including more than 1,000 advanced workers, to systematically spread technical experience among the vast number of employees. Within a month, these "seed-spreading teams" helped the masses achieve more than 1,200 major technical improvements.

    重庆钢铁公司和建设机床厂树立标兵带动全面
    先进人物先进集体不断涌现
    本报重庆4日电　重庆钢铁公司和建设机床厂采取抓先进、插红旗的办法大搞群众运动，不断涌现大批的先进集体和先进人物，有效地推动了生产高潮，使产品质量和产量稳步上升。
    重庆钢铁公司各厂在每次生产运动中，都注意及时培养先进集体和先进个人，树立红旗。去年一年中，这个公司即涌现了一百一十多个先进集体，一千五百多个先进人物。今年第一季度，全公司在掀起制定跃进计划、开展以攻硫为中心的优质高产运动和正在进行的建立群众性的责任制运动中，又涌现了近百个先进集体和一千多先进个人。在年初制定规划中，公司领导上首先抓住了先进生产者黄荣昌、张文金、马海清等人，订出了跃进规划，接着以他们做标兵，在全公司发起了一个赶先进、超先进的讨论制定跃进规划的热潮。
    重庆建设机床厂在今年第一季度里，革新能手廖世刚连续实现六十多项重大技术革新。这个厂的二十五车间的巧姑娘小组在两个月零七天中完成了相当于今年全年的工作量。厂党委及时抓住这两个先进典型，号召全厂职工展开一个男赶廖世刚、女赶巧姑娘小组的轰轰烈烈的竞赛运动。在全厂性的标兵树立起来以后，各单位也层层树立标兵、类类树立标兵，广泛组织和发动群众学习他们，追赶他们，这样，这个厂很快就出现了一个声势浩大的以技术革新为中心的群众运动。近三个月来，职工提出的技术革新建议已在十万件以上。全厂先后出现的廖世刚式的技术革新能手已有六百多人。目前全厂的先进人物达到四千二百多人，全厂女工热烈开展追赶二十五车间巧姑娘小组的竞赛以来，被评为巧姑娘的有三百六十七人。经过先进人物的带动，全厂的先进集体也不断增加，出现了许多大面积丰产的先进单位。全厂出现的先进集体目前已有三十八个。三十五车间在任务大大增加的情况下，本来缺乏两百个劳动力，由于通过抓先进、插红旗，全面开展技术革新等方法，结果不但没有增加工人，反抽调了几十个人支援其他车间。为了及时传播先进人物的先进经验，这个厂2月份以来先后组织了包括一千多先进工人参加的七十六个技术播种队，有组织地在广大职工中传播技术经验。在一个月内，这些“播种队”即帮助群众实现了重大技术改进一千二百多项。
