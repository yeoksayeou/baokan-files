Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, June 20th: Medical workers from various units of the People's Liberation Army's Tibet Military Region are vigorously helping Tibetan compatriots save lives and heal the wounded, and improve sanitary conditions, which has been warmly praised by the Tibetan people. According to incomplete statistics from only ten units, by the end of May, they had provided free medical treatment to more than 6,000 Tibetan compatriots, many of whom were rescued from the brink of death.

During the quelling of the rebellion, medical personnel from each unit immediately treated local Tibetan compatriots for diseases wherever they went, and often spared no effort to climb high mountains and cross glaciers to provide home visits for seriously ill Tibetan compatriots. Many units also transferred some military doctors, nurses, and translators to treat Tibetan compatriots in the vicinity of their驻地 (zhùdì - stationed location/barracks), while also publicizing hygiene knowledge to the Tibetan compatriots. In Lhakhang Dzong, dysentery was prevalent among the Tibetan people. The health team of a certain unit, while eliminating dysentery for the Tibetan compatriots, also transported three boxes of medicines to disinfect the entire village, and carried out propaganda on the prevention of dysentery to all the Tibetan compatriots in the village. Troops in Qushui and other places also helped Tibetan residents to eliminate lice and bedbugs, so that the local Tibetan compatriots gradually developed good hygiene habits.

Under the careful treatment of the People's Liberation Army medical personnel, many Tibetan compatriots who had suffered from the atrocities of the rebels and suffered from chronic diseases quickly recovered their health. A Tibetan woman in Darlung Dzong and her fourteen-year-old daughter were brutally raped by the rebels and were bedridden. After our army arrived, they healed their wounds. In Damshung, Tibetan woman Sangna Ximu was cut by the rebels with a knife because she refused to lead the way for them. Our army rushed to treat her immediately. In Aphe Village, Taktser Dzong, a thirty-year-old Tibetan woman had sores all over her face that constantly oozed yellow pus. In May, after a unit of our army came to this village, medical personnel completely cured the sores on her face in just one week. She gave a thumbs-up to everyone she saw, and praised incessantly, saying: "The doctors sent by Chairman Mao are truly living gods."

Some critically ill Tibetan patients were also saved by the treatment of the troops' medical personnel. A seventeen-year-old Tibetan girl, Tsangmu Ji, from Longzhug Township, Lhuntse Dzong, was playing with a hand grenade she found in the field one day when her left and right hands, legs, and feet were injured by shrapnel, and her life was in danger. After hearing the news, medical personnel from a unit stationed in Lhuntse Dzong carried her to the unit overnight for diagnosis and treatment, applying medicine to her on time every day, injecting penicillin and large amounts of glucose and saline, and also specially assigned a nurse to feed her food and take care of her bowel movements. After more than twenty days of treatment, the girl finally turned from danger to safety. As soon as she saw the doctor, she said: "I will always remember you saviors!" In Lhagari, on May 20th, a Tibetan couple brought their dying only son to the troops for treatment with tears on their faces. The four-month-old child had been running a high fever for three consecutive days, and was already unconscious, his eyes staring blankly, with bursts of convulsions, and his breathing was intermittent. After consultation, the unit's medical personnel determined that it was viral pneumonia, and injected him with streptomycin, penicillin, and glucose, and specially assigned a health worker to live in the child's home and take care of him day and night. After two days, the child's fever subsided.

In order to help Tibetan compatriots cultivate medical workers of their own ethnic group, a medical unit stationed in Shannan and the Tsetang Health Hospital jointly established a Tibetan health worker training class with forty-one students. The training class started on May 20th, and is scheduled to enable the students to master general medical and health knowledge within half a year, and then return to various counties in Shannan to serve as health workers and health care workers.

    翻高山　越冰河　救死扶伤
    西藏军区医务工作者大力帮助藏胞除害灭病
    新华社拉萨20日电　人民解放军西藏军区各部队医务工作者，大力帮助藏族同胞救死扶伤，改善卫生条件，受到藏胞们的热烈赞扬。仅据十个单位的不完全统计，到5月底止，共为藏胞免费治病六千多人次，其中有许多人是从死亡的边缘被抢救了生命。
    平叛期间，各部队的医务人员每到一个地方，就立即为当地藏胞治疗疾病，并且经常不辞辛劳地翻高山、越冰河，为重病的藏胞登门诊治。许多部队还抽调了一部分军医、护士和翻译，在驻地周围一面给藏胞治病，一面向藏胞宣传卫生常识。在拉康宗，藏胞中痢疾流行。某部的卫生组在为藏胞扑灭痢疾的同时，还运去三箱药品对全村进行了消毒，并向全村藏胞进行了预防痢疾宣传。曲水等地部队还帮助藏族居民灭虱、灭臭虫，使当地藏胞逐步养成良好的卫生习惯。
    在人民解放军医务人员的悉心治疗下，许多遭受叛匪残害和患有多年不治之症的藏胞很快恢复了健康。打隆宗一个藏族妇女和她的十四岁的女儿惨遭叛匪轮奸，卧床不起。我军赶到后，给她们治好了创伤。在当许，藏族妇女桑纳喜木，因为拒绝给叛匪带路，被叛匪用刀砍伤。我军赶到立即为她进行了治疗。在太昭宗阿沛村，三十多岁的一个藏族妇女，满脸生疮成天流黄水，5月间，我军某部来到这个村子后，只一星期医务人员就把她满脸的疮完全治好。她见人就翘起大拇指，赞声不绝地说：“毛主席派来的医生真是活神仙。”
    有些垂危的藏族病人也在部队医务人员的治疗下挽救了生命。隆子宗龙学溪卡一个十七岁的藏族姑娘仓姆吉，一天在田野上玩弄一颗拾到的手榴弹时，左右手和两腿、两脚都被弹片炸伤，生命垂危。进驻隆子宗的某部医务人员闻讯后，连夜把她抬到部队里来诊治，每天按时给她敷药，注射青霉素和大量的葡萄糖、盐水，还专门派了个护士喂她食物和接大小便。经过二十多天的治疗，这个姑娘终于转危为安。她一见到医生，就说：“我什么时候都记得你们这些救命恩人！”在拉加里，5月20日有一对藏族夫妇满面泪痕地把他们濒死的独生子抱来部队求治。这个才四个月的孩子接连发了三天高烧，当时已经失去知觉，两眼发直，阵阵痉挛，呼吸断断续续。部队医务人员经过会诊，断定是病毒性肺炎，给他注射了链霉素、青霉素和葡萄糖等，并且专门派了卫生员住到孩子家里日夜护理。过了两天，孩子退了烧。
    为了帮助藏胞培养本民族的医务工作人员，进驻山南的某部医务机关和泽当卫生院合办了一个有四十一名学员的藏族卫生人员训练班。这个训练班已在5月20日开学，预定在半年内使学员们能够掌握一般的医疗卫生知识，然后分别回到山南各县担任卫生员和保健员。
