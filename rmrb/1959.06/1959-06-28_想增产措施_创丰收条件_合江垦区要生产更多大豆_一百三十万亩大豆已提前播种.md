Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, June 27th: The fourteen state-owned agricultural and pastoral farms in the Hegang Reclamation Area of Heilongjiang Province have completed the sowing of 1.3 million mu of soybeans ahead of schedule. The sowing quality all meets technical requirements. The sowing speed is twice as fast as in previous years. The areas where sowing was done early are already a lush green. Now, the farms are taking advantage of the momentum to shift to sowing autumn crops such as grains and fodder, and to field management of soybeans.

The Hegang Reclamation Area is located in the lower reaches of the Songhua River and the west bank of the Heilong River, a region rich in soybeans. This year, the Hegang Agricultural Reclamation Bureau accepted the state's task of producing 150,000 tons of commercial soybeans. All employees in the reclamation area attach great importance to this task, and they are determined to turn the state-owned farms into a base for the country's commercial production. Thinking of measures to increase soybean production and creating conditions for a bumper soybean harvest have become the conscious actions of the employees and their families in the reclamation area. Therefore, everyone was full of energy during the production preparation work in the past winter and this spring, including deep plowing of land, accumulating and making fertilizer, leveling and harrowing land, repairing machinery, building water conservancy projects, and selecting and mixing seeds. Many employees insisted on working in the severe cold of minus twenty degrees Celsius every day.

In the process of soybean sowing, the farms conscientiously implemented the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture." In order to ensure sufficient fertilizer for 1.3 million mu of soybeans, more than 100,000 people and thousands of various types of vehicles were mobilized throughout the reclamation area last winter and this spring to carry out a large-scale fertilizer accumulation and manufacturing campaign. After five or six months of hard work, a total of more than 13.7 billion catties of various fertilizers were accumulated and manufactured throughout the reclamation area, so that the soybean fields basically reached full fertilization, and the amount of fertilizer applied exceeded any previous year. Last year, the entire reclamation area deep-plowed more than 1.6 million mu of land, of which the so-called "trump card" land, which was the deepest plowing, the best harrowing, and the most fertile soil, was all planted with soybeans. Moreover, all soybean fields have been rationally and densely planted, and the seeds sown have been carefully selected and treated with pesticides. After sowing, field inspections and seedling replanting, pest prevention and seedling protection, replanting to ensure full stands, and mechanical shallow harrowing and weeding before and after seedling emergence to preserve soil moisture and resist drought have been universally carried out.

    想增产措施  创丰收条件
    合江垦区要生产更多大豆
    一百三十万亩大豆已提前播种
    据新华社哈尔滨27日电　黑龙江省合江垦区十四个国营农牧场已经提前完成了一百三十万亩大豆的播种任务。播种质量全部合乎技术要求。播种速度比往年快一倍。下种早的地方已一片青绿。现在各农牧场已乘胜转入粮食、饲料等秋季作物播种和大豆田间管理。
    合江垦区地处松花江下游和黑龙江西岸，这里盛产大豆。今年，合江农垦局接受了国家交给的生产十五万吨商品大豆的任务，全垦区职工对这一任务十分重视，他们决心把国营农场变成国家商品生产的基地。为大豆想增产措施，为大豆创丰收条件，已成了垦区职工和家属等的自觉行动。因此，在去冬今春的土地深翻、积肥造肥、整地耙地、机具检修、兴修水利、选种拌种等项生产准备工作中，人人干劲十足，许多职工每天都坚持在零下二十多度的严寒下劳动。
    各农牧场在大豆播种过程中，认真贯彻了农业“八字宪法”。为了保证一百三十万亩大豆施足肥料，去冬今春，全垦区发动了十多万人、几千台各类各型车辆大搞积肥造肥运动，经过五、六个月的苦战，全垦区共积制各种肥料一百三十七亿多斤，使大豆地基本达到满肥，施肥量超过过去任何一年。去年全垦区共深翻地一百六十多万亩，其中耕得最深的、整耙最好的、土质最肥的所谓“王牌”地，全部播上了大豆。而且，全部大豆地都作了合理密植，下地种子经过精选药拌。播种后，又普遍进行了查田补苗、防害保苗、补种全苗和出苗前后机械浅耙除草、保墒抗旱工作。
