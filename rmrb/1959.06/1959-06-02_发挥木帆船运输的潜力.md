    Unleash the Potential of Wooden Sailboat Transportation
    Commentator of this newspaper
    Regarding the potential of waterway transportation, we have already discussed it in the editorial on June 1st. Among waterway transportation, wooden sailboat transportation has the greatest potential.
    Wooden sailboat transportation has a long history in our country. Thousands of years ago, our people "hollowed out wood to make boats and whittled wood to make oars." About 65% of the counties in the country can be reached by wooden sailboats; in some provinces, such as Hunan, about 90% of the counties can be reached by wooden sailboats. In recent years, the volume of freight transported by wooden sailboats accounts for about two-thirds of the total waterway transportation, and the freight turnover volume accounts for about one-fifth of the total waterway freight turnover. At present, there are about 2.81 million tons of professional wooden sailboats and 1.27 million tons of sideline wooden sailboats in the country, not to mention the wooden barges that have already participated in modern ship towing transportation. This is a transportation force that cannot be ignored. In this year's waterway transportation plan, about 60% of the transportation volume is to be borne by this force. Unleashing the potential of wooden sailboat transportation is an important aspect of unleashing the potential of waterway transportation. The National Wooden Sailboat Transportation Technical Innovation and Technical Revolution Experience Exchange Conference held by the Ministry of Communications in Changsha recently has provided us with a broad road to unleash the potential of wooden sailboat transportation.
    Wooden sailboats are a relatively slow means of transportation that requires a lot of labor. Precisely because of this, there have been different views on the use of wooden sailboat transportation. Some people believe that it is impossible to rely on wooden sailboats to increase transportation capacity, and therefore take a passive attitude towards wooden sailboat transportation; others believe that the transportation capacity of wooden sailboats can be greatly improved through technical transformation, and therefore take a positive attitude towards wooden sailboat transportation. Practice has proved that the latter attitude is correct. In 1958, many regions tried in every possible way to carry out technical transformation of wooden sailboats, and as a result, the average carrying capacity of wooden sailboats increased by 30%, completing the heavy transportation tasks at that time. Since November 1958, after the joint meeting on civil transportation work convened by the Transportation Work Department of the CPC Central Committee and the Ministry of Communications of the State Council in Nanjing, another upsurge of technical transformation of wooden sailboats has been launched throughout the country, achieving considerable achievements. It can be seen that although wooden sailboats are a relatively slow means of transportation that requires a lot of labor, this situation is not completely unchangeable. As long as we actively carry out technical transformation of wooden sailboat transportation, it is possible to greatly increase sailing speed and reduce labor consumption.
    In order to further unleash the transportation potential of wooden sailboats, we must first widely implement towing transportation, strive to use modern tugboats to tow or push a large number of wooden sailboats, or manufacture smaller horsepower power engines to motorize wooden sailboats. However, at present, when my country's machinery industry tasks are extremely heavy and fuel is still insufficient, it is impossible to immediately and universally use modern tugboats to tow or push a large number of wooden sailboats and immediately realize the motorization of wooden sailboats. Therefore, we still need to do everything possible to promote the advanced experience of wooden sailboats towing wooden sailboats. In the process of wooden sailboats towing wooden sailboats, the rear boat can use the accompanying water flow generated by the sailing of the front boat to reduce sailing resistance, increase sailing speed, and save a lot of labor. Sichuan, Hunan, Guangxi and other places have made preliminary achievements in this regard. In addition, if we are good at using natural wind power in wooden sailboat navigation, we can also improve transportation efficiency.
    In order to further unleash the transportation potential of wooden sailboats, it is also necessary to focus on the standardization of wooden sailboats, so as to achieve the goals of reducing resistance, increasing speed, reducing weight, increasing load, reducing draft, and saving labor. All localities should, according to the characteristics of their regions, refer to advanced experience to determine excellent ship types for various purposes, and constantly transform old ship types according to excellent ship types. Of course, due to the current transportation tension, it is impossible to stop all the old ships for transformation at once, which requires the adoption of a gradual transformation approach of major repairs for major changes, medium repairs for medium changes, and minor repairs for minor changes. As for the need to add new ships in rivers with large transportation volumes and newly opened rivers, they should be built according to the best ship type. Moreover, while improving the ship type, we should also pay attention to improving the tools and accessories of wooden sailboats.
    In order to further unleash the transportation potential of wooden sailboats, it is also necessary to strengthen the construction of ports, the improvement of waterways, and the construction of shipyards. Ports are the starting point and end point of wooden sailboat transportation. At present, in many places, the non-productive berthing time of wooden sailboats is prolonged due to the failure of port equipment and loading and unloading work to keep up, resulting in a waste of transportation capacity. Especially when a large number of wooden sailboats are towed for transportation, the situation that port equipment and loading and unloading work cannot keep up will become more prominent. This requires vigorously building simple docks and realizing semi-mechanization and mechanization of loading and unloading, so that the port throughput capacity and wooden sailboat transportation capacity can adapt to each other. Waterways are a prerequisite for wooden sailboat transportation. Among the 400,000 kilometers of natural rivers in our country, only 150,000 kilometers can be used by wooden sailboats. Wherever possible, all regions should first open up rivers in areas with large transportation volumes and inconvenient land transportation, especially small rivers in mountainous areas and industrial and mining areas, so as to give full play to the active role of wooden sailboats in small tributaries and short-distance transportation. For rivers with insufficient water sources or steep slopes and rapid water flow, and beaches that are difficult to manage for a while, but with large transportation volumes, simple measures should be taken to build dams and set up sluices to implement river cascade canalization. As for rivers that can already be navigated, the sailing conditions of wooden sailboats should also be continuously improved, beaches should be managed, beach winch equipment should be improved, simple navigation marks should be established, the sailing speed of wooden sailboats should be continuously improved, and night navigation should be carried out within the possible range under the condition of ensuring safety. Wooden sailboat repair and manufacturing factories are also an indispensable and important part of wooden sailboat transportation. In order to build new ships and repair old ships, wooden sailboat repair and manufacturing factories should be built appropriately.
    In order to further unleash the transportation potential of wooden sailboats, we should also vigorously organize internal and external cooperation. The main task of wooden sailboat transportation is to collect and distribute goods for modern transportation tools such as trains, ships and automobiles. Therefore, on the one hand, it needs to carry out strong cooperation in various links within itself, that is, cooperation between types of work and between regions; on the other hand, it needs to carry out comprehensive cooperation with cargo owners and modern transportation tools, so that the transportation capacity of wooden sailboats can be fully utilized.

    发挥木帆船运输的潜力
    本报评论员
    关于发挥水路运输的潜力，我们在6月1日的社论中已经谈过了。在水路运输中，潜力最大的要数木帆船运输。
    木帆船运输在我国有悠久的历史。几千年前，我国人民就“刳木为舟，剡木为楫”。全国有65％左右的县可以通木帆船；有些省份，如湖南省90％左右的县可以通木帆船。近年来，木帆船货运量约占全部水运量的三分之二，货运周转量约占全部水上货运周转量的五分之一。目前全国共约有专业木帆船二百八十一万吨，副业木帆船一百二十七万吨，至于已经参加现代化船舶拖带运输的木驳船还没有计算在内。这是一支不可忽视的运输力量。今年的水路运输计划中，大约有60％的运量，是要靠这支力量来担负的。发挥木帆船运输的潜力，是发挥水路运输潜力的一个重要方面。最近交通部在长沙召开的全国木帆船运输技术革新和技术革命经验交流会议，已经为我们提出了发挥木帆船运输潜力的广阔的道路。
    木帆船是一种速度比较慢，占用劳动力比较多的运输工具。正因为这样，对于利用木帆船运输，曾经有过不同的看法。有些人认为不可能指望木帆船来提高运力，因而对木帆船运输采取消极的态度；还有些人认为通过技术改造是可以大大提高木帆船的运力的，因而对木帆船运输采取积极的态度。实践证明，后一种态度是正确的。1958年许多地区曾多方设法展开木帆船技术改造工作，结果平均提高了木帆船的运载能力30％，完成了当时繁重的运输任务。自1958年11月，中共中央交通工作部和国务院交通部在南京联合召开民间运输工作会议以后，又在全国掀起了木帆船技术改造运动，取得了不少成就。可见，木帆船虽然是一种速度比较慢、占用劳动力比较多的运输工具，但是这种情况并不是完全不可改变的。只要我们积极对木帆船运输进行技术改造，就有可能大大提高航行速度，减少劳动力的消耗。
    为了进一步发挥木帆船的运输潜力，首先要广泛地实行拖带运输，争取用现代化拖轮拖带或顶推大量木帆船，或者制造马力较小的动力机，使木帆船机动化。但是，在目前我国机械工业任务极其繁重和油料尚感不足的情况下，要立即普遍用现代化拖轮拖带或顶推大量木帆船，立即实现木帆船机动化，都是不可能的。因此，我们还需要千方百计推行木帆船拖带木帆船的先进经验。在木帆船拖带木帆船的过程中，后船可以利用前船航行所产生的附随水流，减少航行阻力，提高航行速度，并大量节省劳动力。四川、湖南、广西等地已在这方面取得初步成就。另外，在木帆船航行中，如果善于利用自然风力，也能提高运输效能。
    为要进一步发挥木帆船的运输潜力，还要抓紧木帆船定型工作，使之达到减少阻力，提高航速，减轻自重，增加载重，减小吃水，节约人力的目的。各地应该根据本地区的特点，参照先进经验，确定各种不同用途的优良船型，并根据优良船型不断改造旧的船型。当然，由于当前运输紧张，不能一下子将旧船都停下来进行改造，这就需要采取大修大改、中修中改、小修小改的逐步改造的方针。至于在运量大的和新开辟的河道中，需要增添新船的时候，就应该按照最优良的船型去建造。而且，在改良船型的同时，还要注意改良木帆船的工具和属具。
    为了进一步发挥木帆船运输的潜力，还要加强港口的建设、航道的整治和船厂的建设。港口是木帆船运输的起点和终点。目前，不少地方常常因港口设备和装卸工作跟不上去，使木帆船非生产停泊时间延长，造成运力的浪费。特别是当木帆船大量进行拖带运输后，港口设备和装卸工作跟不上去的情况还会更加突出。这就需要大力建设简易码头，实现装卸半机械化和机械化，使港口吞吐能力和木帆船运输能力互相适应。航道是木帆船运输的先决条件。我国四十万公里的自然河道中，目前能通行木帆船的不过十五万公里。各个地区在可能的条件下，应该首先开辟运量大而陆上交通不便地区的河流，特别是山区和工矿地区的小河流，这样就能充分发挥木帆船在小支流和短途运输中的积极作用。凡是水源不足或坡陡水急，滩险一时不易整治，而运量很大的河流，应该用简易措施筑坝设闸，实行河流梯级渠化。至于在已能通航的河流，也应不断改进木帆船的航行条件，整治滩险，改善绞滩设备，建立简易航标，不断提高木帆船航行速度，并在可能范围内在确保安全的条件下进行夜航。木帆船修造工厂也是木帆船运输中不可缺少的一个重要环节。为了建造新船和维修旧船，就要适当地建设木帆船修造工厂。
    为了进一步发挥木帆船运输的潜力，还应大力组织内外协作。木帆船运输的主要任务是为现代化运输工具，如火车、轮船和汽车集散货物。因此，一方面，它需要在自己内部各环节中进行有力的协作，这就是工种间和地区间的协作；另一方面，又需要和货主以及现代化运输工具进行全面的协作，才能使木帆船的运输能力得到充分发挥。
