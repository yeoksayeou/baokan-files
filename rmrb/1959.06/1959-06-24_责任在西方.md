The Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference has been temporarily adjourned at the suggestion of Western countries. The conference, which lasted for more than a month, failed to reach certain agreements, entirely as a result of obstruction by Western countries, particularly the United States. However, Herter's remarks and the joint statement by the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and France attempt to shift the responsibility for the failure to reach an agreement onto the Soviet Union. US Vice President Nixon even openly said that the apparent failure of the Geneva East-West Foreign Ministers' Conference is clearly the responsibility of the Soviet leaders. However, all such actions by Western countries will be in vain, and the facts cannot be concealed by any lies.

Long before the Geneva Conference, many American newspapers admitted that the United States was forced to participate in this conference. The "New York Times" said: "We were finally lured into a meeting... even before this serious debate began, we were in an uncomfortable situation." At that time, many American newspapers also tried their best to spread pessimistic views such as the "inevitable failure" of the Foreign Ministers' Conference, which also reflected the United States' fear of the conference. At that time, what the US government was busy doing was not creating a favorable atmosphere for the conference, but stepping up the signing of nuclear weapons cooperation agreements with its series of "allies," preparing to establish missile bases on the territories of Italy and Greece, and rapidly arming the West German army with atomic weapons.

After the start of the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference, the United States obviously could not but take into account the strong desire of world public opinion for the conference to contribute to easing the tension in Europe, so it changed its face. On the one hand, it instructed West Germany and France to come forward and adopt a "tough attitude" inside and outside the conference, while it hid behind a veil of hypocrisy and talked about the United States' "sincere desire" to strive for an agreement; on the other hand, it attempted to rely on the Western "package plan" that it had painstakingly pieced together in advance as a magic weapon to obstruct the conference. The United States mobilized its propaganda machine to vigorously tout the "package plan" as "laying the foundation for lasting peace" and "guaranteeing peace and happiness in Europe." However, it is easy to talk about peace, but it is impossible to sell fake goods as genuine goods without being seen through by the people. The world demands the solution of the most urgent and mature issues of the German peace treaty and the West Berlin issue. It was precisely in accordance with this desire that the Soviet Union put forward reasonable proposals for concluding a German peace treaty and turning West Berlin into a free city. However, the "package plan" entangled these two issues with the issues of German unification, disarmament, and European security as "an indivisible whole"; and the solution of all these issues must be conditional on the "reunification" of West Germany's annexation of the German Democratic Republic through "free elections." Even many Western countries and other capitalist countries' newspapers and public opinion believe that this proposal is "unrealistic" and "completely non-negotiable." The British "News Chronicle" bluntly stated that the purpose of the "package plan" is to ask for the sky-high price and obstruct the normal progress of the (Geneva) conference.

Therefore, the "package plan" can only put the Western countries themselves in an embarrassing situation. The American "Wall Street Journal" admitted: "We simply do not have a good way to make American and world public opinion understand the benefits of our peace plan." At the same time, this heavily layered "package" tightly bound the Western countries themselves so that they could not move. At that time, serious differences arose within Western countries regarding whether to stick to the "package" or dismantle it. The British government tended to open it up and discuss the issues with the Soviet Union one by one. Some influential figures in the United States also demanded that the "package proposal" be opened. In fact, the one who tied the knot should untie it. When the United States' Herter, on behalf of the Western countries, proposed a so-called seven-point plan for "unifying" Berlin on May 26, it was to first untie the Berlin issue from the "package plan."

However, the Western countries' proposal of a seven-point plan for Berlin is not enough to show that the United States is willing to take a realistic attitude on this issue. They not only insisted that Western countries "continue to have the right to station troops in Berlin," that is, to maintain the occupation system in West Berlin, but even further demanded that the occupation of West Berlin be extended to East Berlin. They shamelessly said that Berlin is not the territory of the German Democratic Republic, but a four-country "occupation zone." Its absurdity is extreme.

After the Western countries had to start discussing the separate resolution of practical issues such as West Berlin, their absurd proposals seemed completely untenable in the face of the reasonable proposals of the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic. With the support of the German Democratic Republic, the Soviet government advocated that the four major powers sign special documents to guarantee the status of West Berlin as a free city, and proposed that the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union station symbolic troops in West Berlin, or that a limited number of troops from neutral countries replace the troops of the United States, Britain, and France in West Berlin. Subsequently, the Soviet government, considering that the Western countries were unwilling to immediately abandon their position on the occupation system of West Berlin, put forward a new proposal on June 10, not insisting on the immediate and complete abolition of the West Berlin occupation system, and agreed to temporarily preserve some of the Western countries' occupation rights in West Berlin for one year. Recently, on June 19, in order to promote the convergence of the positions of the two sides, the Soviet Union proposed that the one-year period could be extended to one and a half years. At the same time, the four countries drafted an agreement on temporary arrangements for the West Berlin issue, stipulating that Western countries would only retain symbolic troops in West Berlin, stop subversive activities, and not set up atomic weapons and rocket weapons. The Soviet Union's new proposal provided a good basis for reaching an agreement on the West Berlin issue, placing the United States' obstruction activities in an extremely embarrassing situation.

However, as soon as the Soviet government put forward the new proposal, the United States could not wait to set off a gust of wind of "interrupting" the Foreign Ministers' Conference, thus making it go from hidden to open, exposing its true role as the leader in obstructing the conference from reaching an agreement. It clamored that the Soviet Union's proposal was a so-called "ultimatum" and that the United States "cannot negotiate under threat." However, the Soviet government's agreement to temporarily retain the Western occupation rights in West Berlin for one year and one and a half years is precisely a concession to the Western countries in order to strive for the success of the Geneva Conference; the Soviet Union's proposed several aspects of the temporary arrangements for West Berlin, such as reducing the Western military presence in West Berlin, stopping subversive activities, and not setting up atomic and rocket weapons, are also close to the opinions that Western countries have put forward in the discussions. Therefore, how can the Soviet Union's new proposal be a "ultimatum" and a "threat"? The West insists that the Soviet Union give up ending the occupation system of West Berlin, otherwise it will refuse to negotiate. Isn't this really an ultimatum and a threat?

Not only that, the United States even conducted shameless blackmail against the summit meeting that the world is eager to hold. When the Western countries' unreasonable position of insisting on the occupation system of West Berlin at the Geneva Conference was opposed and they were in a difficult situation, the United States used this coercive means, clamoring that the Soviet Union should "pay the price" for the summit meeting, vainly trying to force the Soviet Union to agree to the Western position. According to United Press International, Herter openly demanded that the Soviet Union should pay the price for holding a summit meeting, agreeing to guarantee Western occupation rights in West Berlin before the final settlement of the entire German issue. On June 17, Eisenhower personally came forward to reiterate that the summit meeting must depend on the progress of the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference. He also expressed disagreement with Britain's view that a summit meeting should be held no matter what, saying that Britain's view was "wrong." Thus, it is clear that the United States still wants to treat the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference and the summit meeting from a position of strength. This attitude is obviously not conducive to the discussions of the Foreign Ministers' Conference.

It was precisely this rigid position of the United States that made the Geneva Conference, which had been going on for more than a month, unable to reach certain agreements, and even once faced the threat of collapse. It was only because the pressure of world public opinion was increasing, and at the same time, not all Western countries were willing to bear the responsibility for the collapse of the conference together with the United States, that the United States had to suggest an adjournment in order to gain a breathing opportunity.

It can be seen from this that Herter and his ilk's so-called Western countries "made unremitting efforts" in the six weeks of the Geneva Conference, while the Soviet Union should bear the responsibility for the lack of progress in the conference, can be truly described as a arrogant statement that covers the sky with one hand. However, the six weeks of the conference were not wasted in vain. The hidden and open obstruction activities of the United States have been repeatedly frustrated, the "package plan" has become a stillbirth, and the discussion of the West Berlin issue at the conference has made it difficult for Western countries to escape. The delay of time is not conducive to the West, but is conducive to the people of all countries to persevere in forcing the West to adopt a realistic attitude, because the just and peace-loving strong forces are on the side of the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic.

    责任在西方
    席林生
    日内瓦外长会议已在西方国家的提议下暂时休会了。开了一个多月的会议未能达成某些协议，这完全是西方国家特别是美国的阻碍的结果。但赫脱的谈话以及美英法三国外长的联合声明，竟企图把会议没有取得协议的责任推在苏联身上。美国副总统尼克松甚至公然说：所谓日内瓦东西方外长会议的明显失败，显然是苏联领袖们的责任。但是，西方国家这种种作为，只会是白费心机，事实是任何谎言所不能掩盖的。
    早在日内瓦会议之前，许多美国报纸就承认：美国是被迫参加这次会议的。“纽约时报”曾说：“我们终于被诱入一次会议……甚至在这场认真的争论开始之前，我们就处于不舒服的境地。”当时不少美国报纸还竭力散布外长会议“必然失败”之类的悲观论调，也正反映美国对会议的害怕。当时，美国政府正忙于做的不是为会议创造有利的气氛，而是加紧和它的一系列“盟国”签订核武器合作协定、准备在意大利和希腊的领土上建立导弹基地以及急速以原子武器武装西德的军队。
    日内瓦外长会议开始之后，美国显然不能不估计到世界公众舆论要求会议为缓和欧洲紧张局势作出贡献的强烈愿望，于是它就改换了一副面孔。一方面它指使西德和法国抛头露面在会内和会外采取“强硬态度”，而自己躲在伪善的帷幕后面大谈美国对争取达成协议的“真诚愿望”；另一方面则企图依靠它在事先费了九牛二虎之力才拼凑起来的西方“一揽子计划”，来作为阻挠会议的法宝。美国动员它的宣传机器大事吹嘘“一揽子计划”“奠定了持久和平”、“保障了欧洲的和平和幸福”之类的鬼话。然而，空谈和平容易，要把假货当真货贩卖却逃不过人民的眼睛。举世要求解决目前最迫切又最成熟的对德和约问题和西柏林问题。苏联正是根据这个愿望提出了缔结对德和约和把西柏林变为自由城市的合理建议。但“一揽子计划”把这两个问题同德国统一问题、裁军问题、欧洲安全等问题纠缠在一起，作为“一个不可分割的整体”；而这一切问题的解决又必须以通过“自由选举”实现西德吞并德意志民主共和国的“重新统一”为先决条件。这甚至连许多西方国家和其他资本主义国家的报刊舆论也认为这个建议是“不现实的”、“完全不可谈判的”。英国“新闻纪事报”直截地说：“一揽子计划”其目的是漫天要价，阻挠（日内瓦）会议的正常进展。
    因此，“一揽子计划”只能使西方国家自己处于狼狈的境地。美国“华尔街日报”承认：“我们根本没有能使美国和世界舆论了解我们和平计划的好处”。同时这个重重叠叠的“一揽子包裹”却把西方国家自己紧紧地捆得不能动弹。当时西方国家内部对于坚持“一揽子”还是把它拆开来的问题，就产生了严重的分歧。英国政府倾向于打开来把问题一个一个同苏联讨论。而在美国国内某些有影响人物也要求把“一揽子建议”打开。事实上，解铃还在系铃人，当5月26日美国赫脱代表西方国家提出的一项所谓“统一”柏林的七点计划，就是把柏林问题从“一揽子计划”中先解开来了。
    但是，西方提出关于柏林的七点计划，并不足说明美国愿意在这个问题上采取现实的态度。它们不仅坚持西方国家“继续有权在柏林驻军”，也就是要保持占领西柏林制度，而且竟进一步要求把对西柏林的占领扩大到东柏林，它们厚颜无耻地说柏林不是德意志民主共和国的领土，而是四国的“占领区”。其荒唐可笑到了极点。
    西方国家在不得不开始讨论单独解决西柏林这样的实际问题之后，它们那种荒谬的建议，在苏联和德意志民主共和国的合理建议面前就显得完全站不住脚，在德意志民主共和国的支持下，苏联政府主张四大国签署专门文件来保证西柏林的自由城市地位，并提出由美、英、法和苏联在西柏林驻扎象征性部队，或由中立国家的有限额的部队来代替美、英、法在西柏林的军队。接着，苏联政府考虑到西方国家不愿意立即放弃对西柏林占领制度的立场，在6月10日又提出一项新建议，不坚持立即完全取消西柏林占领制度，并同意暂时保存西方国家在西柏林的某些占领权利一年。最近，即6月19日，苏联为了促进双方立场的接近，又建议一年的期限可以延长到一年半。同时由四国拟定关于西柏林问题的临时性安排的协议，规定西方国家在西柏林只保留象征性部队、停止颠复活动、不设置原子武器和火箭武器。苏联的新建议为西柏林问题达成协议提供了良好的基础，使美国的阻挠活动陷于极端的窘境。
    但是当苏联政府刚提出了新建议，美国就迫不及待地掀起了一股“中断”外长会议的歪风，从而使它从隐蔽走向公开，暴露了它带头阻挠会议达成协议的真正角色。它大肆叫嚣苏联的建议是所谓“最后通牒”，美国“不能在威胁下谈判”。可是，苏联政府同意暂时保留西方在西柏林的占领权利一年和一年半，正是为了争取日内瓦会议成功而对西方国家所作的一种让步；苏联提出的关于西柏林临时性安排的几个方面，如在西柏林减少西方驻军、停止颠复活动、不设置原子和火箭武器等，也都是接近于西方国家在讨论中曾提出的意见的。因此，苏联的新建议怎么能是什么“最后通牒”和“威胁”呢？西方坚持要苏联放弃结束西柏林的占领制度，否则就拒绝谈判，这难道不真正是最后通牒和威胁吗？
    不仅如此，美国对举世渴望举行的最高级会议也居然进行无耻的讹诈。当西方国家在日内瓦会议上坚持占领西柏林制度的无理立场遭到反对而陷于困境时，美国就使出了这种要挟性手段，叫嚣要苏联为最高级会议“付出代价”，妄想迫使苏联同意西方的立场。据合众国际社透露，赫脱公然要求苏联应为举行最高级会议付出价钱，同意在最后解决整个德国问题以前，保证西方在西柏林的占领权利。6月17日艾森豪威尔也亲自出面重申最高级会议必须取决于日内瓦外长会议的进展，他还表示不同意英国认为不论如何都应举行最高级会议的主张，竟说英国的看法是“错误的”。这样，就很清楚地表明美国仍然要从实力地位出发来对待日内瓦外长会议和最高级会议。这种态度显然是不利于外长会议的讨论的。
    正是美国的这个僵硬立场，使得开了一个多月的日内瓦会议不能达成某些协议，甚至曾一度面临破裂的威胁。只是由于世界公众舆论的压力越来越大，同时西方也不是所有国家都愿意同美国一起承担会议破裂的责任，因此，美国才不得不建议休会，以便争取一个喘息的机会。
    由此可见，赫脱之流所谓西方国家在日内瓦会议六周中“作了不懈的努力”，而苏联倒应负担会议没有取得进展的责任，可真称得上是一手遮天的狂妄说法。可是，六周的会议并没有白白浪费时间，美国进行的隐蔽的和公开的阻挠活动已经一再遭到挫败，“一揽子计划”成了死胎，会议对西柏林问题的讨论使西方国家难以遁逃。时间的拖延不利于西方，而有利于各国人民再接再厉地迫使西方采取现实态度，因为公正的爱好和平的强大力量是站在苏联和德意志民主共和国的一边的。
