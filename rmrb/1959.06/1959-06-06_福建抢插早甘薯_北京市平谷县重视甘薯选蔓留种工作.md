Fuzhou, June 5th (reported by this newspaper) To strive for a greater harvest in grain production this year, various parts of Fujian are strengthening field management of early rice while simultaneously launching a production upsurge to rush plant early sweet potatoes. As of May 29th, the province had planted over 770,000 mu of early sweet potatoes, accounting for more than 23% of the planting plan.

Located in the subtropical zone, Fujian Province can plant and harvest sweet potatoes year-round. There are early sweet potatoes planted in spring and harvested in summer, late sweet potatoes planted in summer and harvested in autumn, and overwintering sweet potatoes planted in autumn and harvested the following spring. Its planting area and yield are second only to rice, making it one of Fujian Province's main grain crops. Farmers commonly refer to sweet potatoes and rice together as "golden grain and silver potatoes."

To strive for a bumper sweet potato harvest this year, Party committees in various parts of Fujian have strengthened specific leadership over sweet potato production. They have taken measures such as holding sweet potato high-yield experience exchange meetings, establishing sweet potato seedling management committees, and holding sweet potato planting technology training classes. They have had the masses discuss and decide on this year's sweet potato planting methods and density levels, making this year's measures for increasing early sweet potato production both proactive and reliable, and greatly mobilizing the enthusiasm of the broad masses for production. Various localities began sowing for seedlings around the "Vernal Equinox." Many counties, such as Dongshan and Hui'an, broke with the old idea that seedlings could not grow well locally and became self-sufficient. While raising seedlings, various localities actively accumulated fertilizer and turned the soil to prepare the ridges. Therefore, various localities started planting early sweet potatoes ten days to half a month earlier than last year. Currently, most seedlings are growing vigorously.

In order to give sweet potatoes a longer time to manufacture and accumulate nutrients, promote tuber enlargement, and increase yield, various localities are doing everything possible to increase the speed of sweet potato planting. The Meiyu Brigade of the Jianzhong Commune in Ningde County, based on the strength of labor and technical expertise, formed groups for cutting seedlings, delivering seedlings, transporting fertilizer, preparing the land, and transplanting, adopting a flow-line operation method, greatly improving work efficiency. The team average increased from planting 800 plants per person per day to 1,300 plants. Many communes also adopted the method of plowing, preparing ridges, applying fertilizer, and transplanting simultaneously, speeding up the process. (Guo Shuo Chuan)

Beijing, June 5th (reported by this newspaper) Pinggu County in Beijing is preparing to vigorously develop the selection of vines for planting wheat stubble sweet potatoes. Since the promotion of the "Victory No. 100" sweet potato variety in this county in 1950, the lack of separate seed preservation fields and the failure to select vines during summer sweet potato planting have led to variety degradation and mixing, resulting in a 20%-40% reduction in yield.

After the National Sweet Potato Conference in 1958, Pinggu County paid attention to the work of selecting vines for seed preservation. In addition to explaining the reasons for degradation to the masses and imparting the technology of selecting vines for seed preservation, it also held on-site meetings, requiring all communes to select short-vine sweet potatoes for seed preservation and to ensure separate transportation and separate storage.

    福建抢插早甘薯
    北京市平谷县重视甘薯选蔓留种工作
    本报福州5日电福建各地为争取今年粮食生产更大丰收，在加强早稻田间管理的同时，掀起抢种早甘薯的生产热潮。至5月29日止，全省已插早甘薯七十七万多亩，占种植计划的23％多。
    甘薯在地处亚热带的福建省，一年四季都可以种植和收获。有春种夏收的早甘薯、夏种秋收的晚甘薯、秋种第二年春收的越冬甘薯。它的种植面积和产量仅次于水稻，是福建省主要粮食作物之一，农民们都把甘薯和水稻并列地称为“金谷银薯”。
    为争取今年甘薯大丰收，福建各地党委都加强了甘薯生产的具体领导，分别采取了召开甘薯丰产经验交流会、成立薯苗管理委员会、举办插薯技术训练班等，把今年插薯方式和密植程度交给群众讨论决定，使今年早甘薯的增产措施既积极又可靠，而且大大调动了广大群众的生产积极性。各地在“春分”前后就开始下种育苗。东山、惠安等许多县今年都打破了往年认为本地苗育不长的陈旧观念，自育自给。各地在育苗的同时，积极地积肥，翻土整畦。因此，今年各地比去年提早十天到半个月开始插早薯。目前，大部薯苗长得茁壮。
    为了使甘薯有较长的时间来制造和积累养分，促进块根膨大，增加产量，各地都千方百计地来提高插薯的速度。宁德县洊中公社的湄屿大队，根据劳力强弱、技术特长，分别组成剪苗、送苗、运肥、整地、扦插等小组，采取流水作业法，大大提高了工效，全队平均每人由日插八百株提高到一千三百株。许多公社还采取边犁、边整畦、边下肥、边扦插的办法，加快速度。（郭说传）
    本报讯　北京市平谷县准备大力开展选蔓栽插麦茬薯的工作。这个县从1950年推广胜利百号甘薯以来，由于没有单独留种田，在剪蔓栽夏薯时又没有进行选蔓留种，形成了品种退化和混杂，使产量降低20％—40％。
    1958年全国甘薯会议后，平谷县注意了选蔓留种工作，除向群众讲明退化的道理，传授选蔓留种的技术外，还召开了现场会，要求各公社选用短蔓甘薯留种，并作到单运输、单贮藏。（平谷县农林局）
