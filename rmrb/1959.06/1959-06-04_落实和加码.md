    Implementation and Intensification
    Su Yi
    Many people's communes in various regions are currently discussing production increase targets and measures for this year's major autumn crops. In the discussions, attention is being paid both to ensuring that targets and measures are implemented and to intensifying targets and advancing measures.

    Implementation and intensification may seem contradictory, but they are actually complementary. Implementation means being realistic and approaching the objective laws of development. Intensification, on the other hand, is based on reality and strengthens subjective efforts in accordance with the laws of development.

    Advocating implementation means advocating an honest and scientific attitude, which is the true nature of Communists. Chairman Mao once said, "We should handle affairs honestly; to accomplish anything in the world, an honest attitude is essential." Therefore, we resolutely oppose exaggeration and bragging. However, implementation does not mean being bound by past historical facts. If we simply base our production targets and specific measures on the yields already achieved in the past, it may seem realistic on the surface, but this is merely outdated reality, not the reality that is in motion, developing, changing, and advancing. Such targets, plans, and measures will inevitably lag behind reality. This is not implementation, but backwardness.

    In discussions about planned output, there are often two very different opinions. One is "rather high than low," believing that the higher the target, the more advanced it seems. Clearly, the yield per mu of a certain crop in the local area is around 1,000 jin under current conditions, but they want to set targets of 3,000 jin, 5,000 jin, or even 10,000 jin. The masses do not take such unrealistic targets to heart. Because they believe that such targets are impossible to achieve anyway, why bother trying! This, in turn, harms the enthusiasm of the masses and fails to achieve the goal of increasing production. The other is "rather low than high." Taking last year's output and using it as this year's production target, or even setting it lower than last year's output, believing that this is "proceeding from reality" and is "very implemented" and "very reliable." In fact, this completely ignores the favorable conditions for production this year and is essentially standing still. In this way, it will also harm the enthusiasm of the masses, and there is no question of improving production levels and improving people's lives, which directly violates the fundamental interests of the masses. These two extremely different opinions are merely two different forms of subjectivism; their roots are the same, and the results will inevitably be the same.

    Objective reality is constantly developing; therefore, to conform to objective reality, we must intensify. How much should the "intensity" be increased? This must take into account the existing achievements of last year's production, as well as the various objective conditions and subjective factors for developing production this year (the superiority of the people's communes, the universal implementation of the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture, the richer production experience of cadres and the masses, etc.). The masses praise this kind of target, which can be achieved through real effort, as "picking fruit by jumping up," which is a very appropriate metaphor. Picking fruit is a goal to strive for. To pick the fruit, you have to jump. Jumping means making an effort. If the tree is too small and you can pick the fruit without jumping, the fruit will not be very big. If the tree is too tall and you can't reach the fruit even if you jump desperately, that won't work either. People of different physical strength and skills can handle trees of different heights. What a child can pick by jumping, a young person can pick by simply reaching out. Therefore, the height of targets and measures cannot be the same everywhere. However, one point should be consistent: to allow everyone to "jump" to the best of their ability.

    The masses are very willing to jump up and pick bigger fruits. The "Labor Exceeding Quotas" and "Actual Production Exceeding Contracted Production" movement launched by the Baimao Commune in Changshu, Jiangsu, is an example. The labor quotas and contracted production targets of this commune were formulated after detailed discussions among the masses, based on implementation. And once a mass "intensification" socialist labor competition was launched, many people broke their quotas and strived to overfulfill their contracted production plans. It can be seen that implementation and intensification, standing on solid ground and jumping up, will surely reach a new height and pick bigger and more beautiful fruits.

    落实和加码
    苏宜
    各地许多人民公社正在讨论今年大秋作物的增产指标和增产措施。在讨论中，既注意到使指标和措施双双落实，也注意到使指标加码，措施先进。
    既要落实，又要加码，看来有些矛盾，实则相辅相成。落实，就是实事求是，比较接近事物的客观发展规律。加码，是在实际基础上，按照事物发展的规律，加强主观努力。
    提倡落实，就是提倡一种老老实实的科学态度，这是共产党人的本色。毛主席早就说过：“我们应该是老老实实地办事；在世界上要办成几件事，没有老实态度是根本不行的。”因此我们力戒浮夸，反对吹牛皮。但是，落实并不等于拘泥于过去历史上已有的事实。如果仅仅根据过去已经达到的产量出发，来订产量指标，来定具体措施，表面上看来是合乎实际的了，其实这仅仅是过时的实际，而不是正在运动、发展、变化、前进着的实际。这样的指标、计划和措施不可免地会是落后于现实的。这样就不是落实，而是落后。
    在计划产量的讨论中，往往有两种很不相同的意见。一种是“宁高勿低”，以为指标订得愈高愈显得先进。明明当地某种作物在目前的条件下每亩产量是一千斤左右，却要订三千斤、五千斤，甚至一万斤。这种脱离实际的指标，群众并不放在心上。因为他们认定这种指标反正达不到，何必努力！这就反而伤害了群众的积极性，达不到提高生产的目的。还有一种是“宁低勿高”。把去年的产量拿过来，就作为今年的生产指标，甚至还低于去年的产量，以为这样做才是“从实际出发”，才是“十分落实”“十分可靠”。其实，这是完全抹煞了今年生产上的有利条件，实际上就是停步不前。这样，同样会伤害群众的积极性，当然也谈不上提高生产水平，改善人民生活，这就直接违反了群众的根本利益。这两种极端不同的意见，不过是主观主义的两种不同形式的表现；根源相同，结果也必然相同。
    客观实际是在不断发展的，因此，要符合客观实际，就必须加码。“码”要加多少？这就必须考虑到去年生产的既有成就，同时又考虑到今年发展生产的各种客观条件和主观因素（人民公社的优越性、八字宪法的普遍实行、干部和群众的生产经验更加丰富等等）。群众称赞这种经过切实努力可以达到的指标是“跳起来摘果子”，这是很恰当的比喻。摘果子，是奋斗目标。要摘到果子，只有跳起来。跳，就是要努力。如果树太小，不跳也能摘到果子，可是果子不会很大。如果树太高，拼命跳也够不着果子，那也不行。摘果子的人的体力和技能不同，能对付的树的高度也各不相同。小孩子跳一跳能摘到的，青年人伸伸手就能摘到。因此，指标和措施的高度也不能处处相同。但是，有一点应该是一致的：要让每个人都能各尽其能地“跳一跳”。
    群众是十分愿意跳一跳去摘更大的果子的。江苏常熟白茆公社展开的“劳动超定额”、“实产超包产”的运动，就是一个例子。这个公社的劳动定额和包产指标是经过群众详细讨论之后，在落实的基础上制订出来的。而一经发动起群众性的“加码”的社会主义劳动竞赛，许多人又纷纷突破定额，并力争超额完成包产计划。可见，落实而又加码，站在坚实的土地上而又跳起来，必能达到一个新的高度，摘到更大更美的果子。
