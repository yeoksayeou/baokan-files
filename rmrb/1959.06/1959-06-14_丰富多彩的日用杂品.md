Daily sundries are an important part of people's daily necessities, and there are many types, which can be roughly divided into the following categories: daily ceramics, such as vats, basins, jars, bowls, pots, plates, dishes, spoons, etc.; daily iron products, such as iron pots, iron spoons, iron kettles, kitchen knives, etc.; daily wooden products, such as wooden basins, wooden buckets, meat mounds, cutting boards, washboards, tables, benches, bed boards, etc.; daily willow woven products, such as winnowing fans, baskets, etc.; daily bamboo products, such as bamboo beds, bamboo curtains, bamboo sieves, bamboo baskets, bamboo chopsticks, bamboo chairs, etc.; daily rattan products, such as rattan chairs, rattan beds, rattan baby carriages, rattan mats, rattan boxes, etc.; daily wicker products, such as earthen baskets, earthen baskets, etc.; daily palm products, such as palm clothing, palm brushes, palm brooms, palm boxes, palm beds, etc.; daily grass products, such as straw hats, straw mats, reed mats, straw sandals, straw handbags, straw curtains, etc.

In addition, there are handmade paper, umbrellas, palm-leaf fans, etc.

Daily Ceramics

Ceramics are various utensils made of porcelain clay, clay, feldspar, quartz, and other raw materials and fired. Due to different raw materials, different firing temperatures, different manufacturing methods (ranging from fine to rough), and the presence or absence of glaze, transparency or opacity, there are distinctions between earthenware, pottery, and porcelain. Earthenware is made from coarse raw materials.

China's ceramics have a long history, excellent quality, durability, exquisite painting, and a wide variety. Porcelain is most famous in Jingdezhen in Jiangxi, Liling in Hunan, Tangshan in Hebei, Dehua in Fujian, Zibo in Shandong, Chaoshan in Guangdong, and Jinzhou in Liaoning. Pottery is most famous in Shiwan in Guangdong, Yixing in Jiangsu, Longquan in Zhejiang, and Shenhouzhen in Henan. In particular, Jingdezhen in Jiangxi is a world-renowned "Porcelain Capital." The characteristics of the porcelain produced are: "as white as jade, as thin as paper, as bright as a mirror, and with a sound like a chime." They are exquisite and ingenious, especially famous for decorative art pieces. Yixing in Jiangsu was once known as the "Pottery Capital." The pottery produced there includes rough goods, such as large vats, long vats, wine jars, and earthenware pots; black goods, such as alms bowls, oil bottles, and tea bottles; stream goods, such as tea urns and wine urns; as well as sandy goods and purple clay goods, in six varieties. Especially the purple clay ware, such as teapots and teacups, has the characteristic that tea stored in it will not spoil overnight even in the hot summer; after long-term use, it can absorb tea juice, and boiling water poured into it will produce a fragrance; it is highly fire-resistant and will not burst easily when placed on a hot stove; and it becomes smoother and brighter with use, and is not easily cracked. Yixing's purple clay ware, such as various tea sets, flower pots, and vases, are the most exquisite products among pottery.

Handmade Paper

China's handmade paper (manual paper) has a long production history, and production areas are almost all over the country. This kind of handmade paper is mostly made of tender bamboo and water bamboo as raw materials, so the output, variety, and quality are high in Zhejiang, Hunan, Fujian, Sichuan, Anhui, Guizhou, and other provinces where bamboo resources are abundant. Handmade paper includes cultural paper for writing, calligraphy, painting, and printing, toilet paper, paper for packaging goods, and paper for industrial use as raw materials for waxed paper blanks and umbrellas, buttons, etc. Handmade paper is closely related to people's lives, and in key production areas, it is an important rural sideline income.

Xuan paper, a type of cultural paper, is produced in Jing County, Anhui Province. It is soft and delicate, and is the paper most liked by Chinese calligraphers and painters for writing couplets, biographies, and painting watercolors and ink paintings. With the development of China's chemical industry, the amount of filter paper used has increased, and Xuan paper has become an excellent filter paper. Luo Wen, Lian Shi, Mao Bian, Yu Ban, and Yuan Shu papers are soft, have strong ink absorption, are not slippery, and dry easily, making them good paper for practicing calligraphy and printing woodcut classic books.

Red Xin paper (also known as Gaoli paper), produced in the north, is Chengwen paper (also known as Mao Tou paper), mostly made from mulberry bark, waste hemp, rice straw, etc. This kind of paper has long fibers, is strong and durable, and has cold resistance. It is generally used to paste windows, line cotton clothes, and is also a necessary cold-proof product for transporting fruits and liquid medicines in cold climates.

China's handmade paper has a wide range of uses and a large output, accounting for about 20% of the total sales of paper in the country over the years, playing an important role in supplementing the shortage of machine-made paper.

Chopsticks

There are many varieties of chopsticks in China, including ivory chopsticks, bone chopsticks, plastic chopsticks, nandina chopsticks, lacquer chopsticks, ebony chopsticks, holly chopsticks, bamboo chopsticks, etc., among which bamboo chopsticks are the most widely used. Bamboo chopsticks are divided into white bamboo chopsticks, red bamboo chopsticks, square bamboo chopsticks, and round bamboo chopsticks; all of them are made of bamboo. China's bamboo producing areas in the south of the Yangtze River, such as Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangxi, Hunan, Sichuan and other provinces, are the main producing areas of bamboo chopsticks.

Why are bamboo materials mostly used for chopsticks? Because bamboo material is hard in nature, elastic, and has fine fibers. After being soaked in water and hot water, it is not easy to bend. When eating with it, no matter how thick the grease and dirt are, it will be as clean as new after washing. In particular, nandina chopsticks are a specialty of Zhejiang Province. It is made of a naturally grown solid ancient bamboo, which is processed with hot-stamped flowers and inlaid with white iron heads. It is not only beautiful and durable, but also easier to wash away dirt because it has bamboo skin.

Fujian's lacquer chopsticks are one of China's special handicrafts. They are also made of bamboo, after exquisite processing, black raw lacquer is matched with bright pigments such as vermilion, light yellow, and apple green. They are bright in color, durable, do not fade, do not peel, and are not afraid of water immersion and hot scalding. Ebony chopsticks and holly chopsticks are produced in Guangdong and Henan. Their properties are similar to bamboo chopsticks, and they are hard, beautiful and durable. These are more advanced chopsticks.

Palm-Leaf Fan

Palm-leaf fan, also called banana leaf fan, is a specialty of Guangdong Province in China, mainly produced in Xinhui and other counties in Guangdong.

Palm-leaf fan are made of palm leaves. Due to the different quality of the palm leaves used (old or tender) and the fineness of the processing method, they are divided into varieties such as "glass fan", "chicken heart fan", and "ox heart fan". The glass fan is specially processed and manufactured, using glass or plastic as the fan handle, which is exquisite and beautiful, and can be used as a gift for relatives and friends, and is also very popular abroad. As for general palm-leaf fans, the best are those with bright colors, dense connections, and thick fan handles.

The by-products left over from processing palm-leaf fans are also widely used. Palm tails can be used to weave palm hats and palm baskets; palm rattan (also called palm tendon) can be used to weave palm mats, which are better than rattan mats, foldable, easy to carry, smooth without knots, and inexpensive; palm bones can be made into toothpicks, which are slender and elastic.

Palm-leaf fan are indispensable for people in summer, and are also the main sideline production of the people in Xinhui and other counties in Guangdong. In 1958, Xinhui County produced more than 60 million palm-leaf fans, with an output value of more than 6 million yuan, which is an important income for the local people.

Umbrella

When it rains, people cannot do without umbrellas, especially in southern China, where the rainy season is long, umbrellas have become indispensable items all year round. Umbrellas can not only be used to avoid rain, but also to block the sun in hot weather. It is characterized by convenient carrying and low price, so the majority of people are very accustomed to using it.

The southern provinces of China are rich in bamboo, tung oil, and leather paper and cotton paper, which are the main raw materials for manufacturing umbrellas. Therefore, umbrella production is also common in the southern provinces. Zhejiang, Fujian, Hunan, Hubei, Guangdong, Sichuan and other provinces are the main producing areas of umbrellas. In particular, the various umbrellas with paintings, art patterns, bright oil, and red oil produced in Zhejiang and Fujian are famous throughout the country and are also very famous in various parts of Nanyang abroad because they are exquisite, beautiful, light and durable.

    丰富多彩的日用杂品
    日用杂品是人们日常生活用品中的一个重要部分，种类很多，大体可分为下列几类：日用陶瓷器，如缸、盆、罐、碗、壶、盘、碟、匙等；日用铁制品，如铁锅、铁勺、铁壶、菜刀等；日用木制品，如木盆、木桶、肉墩、案板、洗衣搓板、桌、凳、床板等；日用柳编制品，如簸箕、筐箩等；日用竹制品，如竹床、竹帘、竹筛、竹篮、竹筷、竹椅等；日用藤制品，如藤椅、藤床、藤小孩车、藤席、藤箱等；日用荆制品，如土筐、土篮等；日用棕制品，如棕衣、棕刷、棕笤帚、棕箱、棕床等；日用草制品，如草帽、草席、苇席、草鞋、草手提包、草帘等。
    此外还有土纸、雨伞、葵扇等等。
    日用陶瓷器
    陶瓷器是以瓷土、粘土、长石、石英等为原料，烧制而成的各种器皿。因原料不同、烧火度有高低、制法有精粗，与有釉无釉、透明不透明等而有土器、陶器、瓷器的区别。土器是用粗原料作的。
    我国的陶瓷器具有悠久的历史，品质优良，经久耐用，彩绘精美，多种多样。瓷器以江西景德镇、湖南醴陵、河北唐山、福建德化、山东淄博、广东潮汕、辽宁锦州等地最著名。陶器以广东石湾、江苏宜兴、浙江龙泉、河南神后镇等地的最著名。特别是江西景德镇，是举世闻名的“瓷都”，所产瓷器的特点是：“白如玉、薄如纸、明如镜、声如磬”，精巧玲珑，妙夺天工，尤其以陈列艺术品最著名。江苏宜兴曾有“陶都”之称，其所产陶器有粗货，如大缸、长缸、酒坛、砂锅等；黑货，如钵子、油瓶、茶瓶等；溪货，如茶瓮、酒瓮等；以及砂货和紫砂货等六种。尤点是紫砂器，如茶壶、茶碗，其特点是在酷暑盛夏所盛的茶水隔夜也不变味；久用后能吸收茶汁，沸水注入，有香味；耐火性强，放在高热的炉上，不易爆破；越用越光滑、发亮，而且也不容易裂。宜兴的紫砂器，如各种茶具、花盆、花瓶等是陶器中最精致的产品。
    土纸
    我国土纸（手工纸）生产历史悠久，生产地区几乎遍布全国。这种土纸多以嫩竹、水竹等作原料，因此在竹源丰富的浙江、湖南、福建、四川、安徽、贵州等省产量大，品种多，质量也好。土纸包括写字、书画、印刷等用的文化纸、卫生纸，包装物品用纸，以及工业方面制腊纸坯和雨伞、纽扣等原料用纸。土纸和人民生活关系非常密切，在重点产区是农村一项重要副业收入。
    文化纸中的宣纸，产于安徽省泾县，质柔细腻，为我国书画家们写对联、传记，绘水彩、墨画最喜欢用的纸。随着我国化学工业的发展，过滤纸用量增大，宣纸又成为优良的过滤用纸。罗纹、连史、毛边、玉板、元书等纸，质柔软、吸墨力强、不滑、易干，是练习毛笔写字和印刷木刻版经典书籍的很好用纸。
    北方产的红辛纸（又名高力纸），呈文纸（又名毛头纸），多是用桑条皮、废麻、稻草等为原料制成的。这种纸纤维长、质坚固耐用，并有抗寒能力，一般用它糊窗，衬棉衣，也是严寒气候运输水果和水剂药品必不可缺的防寒用品。
    我国土纸用途很广，产量也大，历年约占全国整个纸张销售量的20％左右，对弥补机制纸的不足起着重要的作用。
    筷子
    我国的筷子品种很多，有象牙筷、骨筷、塑料筷、天竺筷、漆筷、乌木筷、冬青木筷、竹筷等等，其中使用最广的是竹筷。竹筷有白竹筷、红竹筷、方竹筷、圆竹筷之分；都是用竹子制成的。我国江南产竹地区，如浙江、福建、江西、湖南、四川等省都是竹筷的主要产区。
    为什么筷子原料多采用竹材呢？因竹材性质坚硬，有弹力，纤维细，经过水浸、热水烫后不容易弯屈；用它吃饭时，不论粘得多么浓厚的油脂和污垢，经过洗刷，清洁如新。特别是天竺筷，是浙江省的一种特产。它是用一种自然生长的实心古竹制成的，经过加工烫花、嵌以白铁头，不仅美观耐用，而且因带有竹皮，更容易洗滁去污。
    福建的漆筷是我国特种手工艺品之一，也是用竹材制的，经过精致加工，将黑色生漆，配以朱红、淡黄、苹果绿等鲜明颜料加工而成，色泽鲜明，经久耐用，不退色、不脱漆皮，不怕水浸热烫。乌木筷和冬青木筷产于广东和河南，性质与竹筷相似，质地坚硬，美观耐用。这些都是较高级的筷子。
    葵扇
    葵扇也叫芭蕉扇，是我国广东省的一种特产，主要产于广东新会等县。
    葵扇是用葵树叶加工制成的，由于所用的葵叶老嫩质量的不同，以及加工方法的粗细，分“玻璃扇”、“鸡心扇”、“牛心扇”等品种。玻璃扇是经过特别加工制造的，用玻璃或塑胶作扇柄，精致美观，可作礼品赠送亲友，在国外也很受欢迎。至于一般葵扇，以色泽明亮，连密，扇柄肥壮的最好。
    加工葵扇后所剩的副产品用途也很广。葵尾可用来编制葵帽和葵篮；葵藤（也叫葵筋）可以编制葵席，比藤席还好，可折叠，携带方便，无节光滑，价格低廉；葵骨可以制牙签，细长、有弹性。
    葵扇是人们夏季离不开的东西，也是广东新会等县人民的主要副业生产。1958年新会县生产葵扇六千多万把，产值是六百多万元，为当地人民的一项重要收入。
    雨伞
    一遇雨天，人们就少不了用伞，特别是我国南方地区雨季较长，雨伞更成了一年四季都不可缺少的用品。雨伞不仅可用来避雨，在炎热的气候下还可以用来遮太阳。它的特点是携带方便，价格低廉，因而广大群众都很习惯用它。
    我国南方各省，盛产竹子、桐油以及皮纸、绵纸，这些都是制造雨伞的主要原料。所以雨伞生产也遍及南方各省。浙江、福建、湖南、湖北、广东、四川等省都是雨伞的主要产区。尤其是以浙江、福建产的绘画、美术图案、明油和红油各种雨伞，因为精致美观，轻便耐用，不但著名全国，在国外南洋各地也很有名声。
