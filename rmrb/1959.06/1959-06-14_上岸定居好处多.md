Editor's Notes
    Settling ashore for boat people's families is a good thing that deserves promotion.

    For a long time, the vast majority of boat people have taken boats as their homes, living on boats, drifting around without a fixed place, exposed to wind and rain. When they get sick, they cannot get timely treatment, children have no schools to attend, and there is always the risk of falling into the water. Families have no way to engage in sideline occupations. Implementing settlement ashore can not only fundamentally change this situation, but also cultivate a sense of collectivism and improve political awareness among boat people's families in settled life.

    Boats are transportation tools. When boat people's families live on boats, furniture and sundries take up a lot of cabin space, reducing transportation efficiency. After more than 300 families in Jianhu County moved ashore, more than 200 tons of cabin space were freed up; if all the boat people's families in the country moved ashore, it would definitely increase the country's transportation capacity considerably.

    Therefore, it is beneficial to both boat people and the country for boat people's families to go ashore. We hope that more boat people's families will move ashore and establish more new villages for boat people.

### 上岸定居好处多

    上岸定居好处多
    船民家属上岸定居，是一件值得提倡的好事。
    长期以来，广大船民都是以船为家，船上生活，漂泊无定，风吹雨打，病了不能及时治疗，小孩没有学校上，而且随时都有失足落水的危险。家属要搞点副业，也没有门路。实行上岸定居，不仅可以从根本上改变这种情况，而且船民家属在定居生活中可以培养集体观念，提高政治觉悟。
    船是运输工具，船民家属住在船上，家具杂物，就要占去不少舱位，降低载运效率。建湖县三百多名家属上了岸，就腾出了两百多吨舱位；如果全国的船民家属都上岸来，一定能够为国家增加不少的运力。
    因此，船民家属上岸，无论对船民、对国家，都是有利的。我们希望更多的船民家属都搬上岸来，建立更多的船民新村。
