    Rose Valley
    —Bulgarian Sketches, Part 3
    Ling He
    We went sightseeing in the plain known as Rose Valley and, at noon, we were guests at the home of Comrade Jamiev in the countryside.

    Everywhere there were water buffalo, yellow cattle, and donkeys, making me wonder if I was back in China. But then I saw Gypsy children running in front of roadside huts and pairs of red-billed white cranes pecking at the grass, and I was once again drawn in by the foreign people and things.

    We got out of the car in front of a small courtyard and met Comrade Jamiev’s parents, wife, and children. They were all so kind to me that it felt like returning to my own hometown.

    The garden had many fruit trees such as pears, peaches, apples, and lemons, as well as various roses displayed in the courtyard, which were especially pleasing to the eye. Comrade Jamiev’s father accompanied us in the orchard and talked about the agricultural cooperative; they mainly grow cash crops, and each work day earns thirty leva. Each family can have four mu of private land, and the income from fruit is quite high. His family built a new house with forty thousand leva. It doesn't have many rooms, but it is newly decorated with curtains and carpets, and has electricity, radios, and glassware, not far from the living standards of the city.

    This is the southern foothills of the Balkan Mountains, with large areas of land planted with roses. We wandered in the flower fields, and although the flowers had already been picked in the morning and sent to the factory, the fragrance was still rich and intoxicating. These roses are pink, single-petaled, and not brightly colored, exactly the same as the roses used in our country to make rose sugar. A few of them are large white roses, but the fragrance is not as good. These red roses are boiled and distilled into rose oil. Every three and a half tons of flowers can yield two kilograms of oil, which can be exchanged for two kilograms of gold. During the fascist occupation before the war, the German army, for the sake of food supply, and because there was no market for rose oil at the time, ordered the local people to remove the roses and plant wheat instead, resulting in great losses. According to statistics, the recovered rose production is only one-tenth of what it was before the war, and efforts are still being made to vigorously reproduce and restore it. The characteristic of rose oil is that it is fragrant and long-lasting; a drop on clothing lasts for more than a month. We envy the people of Rose Valley for living in a world of color and fragrance, a blessing indeed, but they are used to it and don't find it surprising, truly "people in bliss unaware of bliss.” I couldn't help but recite:

    People in Rose Valley, live in a world of flowers.
    Good flowers bloom everywhere, spring ends but flowers never fade.
    Fragrance fills the air, flowers are picked freely.
    Make oil and exchange for gold, sell goods to beauties,
    Brutal fascists, unaware of the love of fragrant flowers;
    Only filling the stomachs of dogs and horses, forcibly cutting down all the flowers,
    Did they care about the fragrant souls, the flower farmers' hearts were broken!
    Liberation has brought another spring, flowers bloom and fragrance lasts;
    Fragrant fields, fragrant valley people, happiness for ten thousand years.
    Tourists drink the fragrant breeze, this heart will never be defiled.

    玫瑰谷
    ——保加利亚散记之三
    凌鹤
    我们到被称为玫瑰谷的平原上观光，中午，到农村——贾密流同志家中作客。
    到处有水牛、黄牛和毛驴，疑心置身祖国，但看到吉普赛的小孩在道旁小屋前奔逐，还有成对的红喙白鹤在草地上啄食，又被异国人、物牵惹情怀了。
    在小院落的门前下车，和贾密流同志的父母妻儿见了面，他们都对我那末亲切，恍如回到自己的家乡。
    园中有梨、桃、苹果、柠檬等果木甚多，还有各色玫瑰陈列在庭前，特别赏心悦目。贾密流同志的父亲陪同我们在果园中谈农业合作社的情况；他们以经济作物为主，每一工作日可分得三十个立瓦的收入，每家可有四保亩的自留地，水果收入颇多。他家里以四万立瓦盖了一幢新屋，房间不多，但是窗帘地毯，陈设一新，还有电灯、收音机、玻璃器皿等，和城市生活水平相去不远。
    这里是巴尔干山的南麓，大片的土地栽种玫瑰花。我们在花地中徜徉，虽然已在早晨摘去了花朵送进工厂，还是浓香馥郁，沁人心脾。这种玫瑰粉红，单瓣，颜色不艳，和我国制玫瑰糖用的玫瑰花完全一样。其中有少数白玫瑰花大，但是香味不佳。这种红玫瑰经过水煮蒸馏，便成玫瑰油。每三吨半花可得油两公斤，能换黄金两公斤。当战前法西斯占领时，德国军队为了粮食供应，加之当时玫瑰油没有市场，命令该地群众铲除玫瑰改种麦类粮食，损失很大，现在据统计，恢复的玫瑰生产，只有战前十分之一，现仍在大力繁殖恢复中。玫瑰油的特点是香浓持久，一滴沾衣，历时月余不失。我们羡慕玫瑰谷的人们长住色香世界，艳福不浅，可是他们习以为常，不足为奇，真所谓“人在福中不见福”了。我不禁吟哦着：
    玫瑰谷中人，长住花世界。
    好花遍地开，春残花不败。
    馥郁袭人怀，花多恁恣采，
    制油换黄金，货与佳人买，
    残暴法西斯，香花不知爱；
    徒果犬马腹，强迫花尽刈，
    彼岂惜香魂，花农心裂碎！
    解放又逢春，花发香长在；
    花田香谷人，幸福万千载。
    游客饮香风，此心永不秽。
