    Two Good Articles on Literary Creation
    Ri Ke
    The June issues of "People's Literature" and "Liberation Army Literature and Art" published Liang Bin's "Random Talk on the Creation of 'Red Flag Spectrum'" and Wang Yuanjian's "Under the Spiritual Radiance of Revolutionary Predecessors," respectively. These are two articles by writers about their own creative work. Liang Bin is the author of the novel "Red Flag Spectrum," and Wang Yuanjian is the author of the short story collections "Party Membership Dues" and "The Next Generation." These works are familiar to readers. In these two articles, they gave detailed accounts of the creative process of these works, involving some creative issues, such as how many of the characters in the works grew up on the basis of a model: how the model inspired the author's conception, and how the author integrated the model with his own life experience for generalization and processing. Both writers made unique elaborations based on their own creative practices. For example, Zhu Lao Zhong in "Red Flag Spectrum," who left a deep impression on readers, was created by Comrade Liang Bin in many works, enriching his character time and time again. The image of Zhu Lao Zhong that finally appeared in "Red Flag Spectrum," although still bearing traces of the model's spirit, is no longer exactly the same as the author's original short story about this character, "The Father of Three Bolsheviks," because the author has carried out extensive generalizations on the basis of this model, giving it a deeper and broader social and historical content. Although some of Comrade Wang Yuanjian's novels are stories he heard, in the creative process of these works, the author's profound life experiences were also added. These experiences vividly illustrate the significance of artistic generalization in literary creation. Similarly, from their articles, we can clearly see the enormous role that a proletarian writer's revolutionary worldview plays in his creation—whether it is conceiving characters, handling plots, or developing stories. These two articles can not only help readers understand their works, but also help writers and literary critics explore and study creative and theoretical issues.

    两篇谈文学创作的好文章
    日克
    六月号的“人民文学”和“解放军文艺”分别发表了梁斌的“漫谈‘红旗谱’的创作”和王愿坚的“在革命前辈精神光辉的照耀下”，这是两篇作家谈自己创作的文章。梁斌是长篇小说“红旗谱”的作者，王愿坚是短篇小说集“党费”和“后代”的作者，这些作品是为读者所熟悉的。在这两篇文章里，他们对于这些作品的创作经过，作了详细的叙述，其中涉及到一些创作上的问题，像作品中的许多人物是怎样在一个模特儿基础上成长起来的：模特儿怎样激发了作者的构思，作者又怎样把模特儿和自己的生活经验融合起来进行概括和加工的，这两位作家都根据自己的创作实践，作了独到的阐发。譬如像给读者留下深刻印象的“红旗谱”里的朱老忠，梁斌同志就曾经在很多作品里创造它，一次又一次地丰富它的性格，最后出现在“红旗谱”里的朱老忠的形象，虽然还有着模特儿的精神痕迹，但是，它已经和作者最初的写这个人物的短篇“三个布尔塞维克的爸爸”，不尽相同了，因为作者在这个模特儿的基础上已经进行了广泛的概括，使它具有了更深广的社会历史内容。王愿坚同志的小说，虽然有一部分是听来的故事，但是，在这些作品的创作过程里，也同样加入了作者深刻的生活感受。他们这些经验都生动地说明了艺术概括在文学创作中的意义。同样的，从他们的文章里，我们也可以清楚地看到，一个无产阶级作家的革命的世界观，在他的创作里——无论是构思人物、处理情节、发展故事，起着多么巨大的作用。这两篇文章不仅可以帮助读者理解他们的作品，而且也可以帮助作家和文艺批评家探讨和研究创作上和理论上的问题。
