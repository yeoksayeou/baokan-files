　　Hogs Leave Pen, Rapeseed Abundant, Tea Marketed, Native Products Increase
　　Chongqing Massively Purchases Suburban Agricultural and Sideline Products
　　Wugang County, Hunan, Overfulfills Second Quarter Sideline Product Procurement Plan

　　(Xinhua News Agency) Chongqing, Sichuan, and Wugang County, Hunan, are vigorously purchasing agricultural and sideline products. Chongqing has procured over 40,000 hogs and over 6,250,000 jin of rapeseed in the past two months, along with many small industrial raw materials and miscellaneous goods. Wugang County had purchased sideline products (including non-staple foods and local specialties) worth over 400,000 yuan by the end of May, completing the second quarter procurement plan ahead of schedule.

　　(Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, June 16) Chongqing's commercial departments are seizing the current season for hogs leaving the pen and rapeseed, tea, and other products entering the market, strengthening procurement efforts.

　　This year, the inclusion of Ba County, Qijiang, and Changshou counties into Chongqing has expanded the suburban area, increasing the supply of food and supplies from the suburbs to the city. To promptly procure agricultural and sideline products, responsible cadres from relevant specialized companies in Chongqing have gone to various districts, counties, people's communes, and management areas to understand the situation and arrange procurement work. The Municipal Food Company, Native Produce Company, Oil, Salt, Sugar, Tobacco, and Wine Company, and commercial departments of various districts and counties have all increased procurement personnel and improved procurement methods to facilitate sales by communes and farmers as much as possible. The commercial department of Ba County has organized over 300 cadres and over 1,400 small vendors to go to the countryside to help communes harvest agricultural products and purchase them on the spot. Jiangbei District originally had only three procurement points, and farmers reported that it was far away and inconvenient to sell agricultural and sideline products. The local commercial department changed to using wooden boats for mobile procurement along the river, greatly facilitating farmers.

　　During procurement, commercial department cadres publicized the significance of rural areas supporting the city, and commune members were very enthusiastic about selling agricultural and sideline products. Many communes immediately dried and cleaned rapeseed after harvesting it and sold it to the state. The city has completed nearly half of its plan to procure over 14,000,000 jin of rapeseed. In the past twenty days or so, suburban farmers have also sold a large amount of yellow mats, palm fiber, rosin oil, straw hats, and other miscellaneous goods to the Native Produce Company, supporting urban production and supplying urban residents.

　　(Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, June 16) The CCP Wugang County Committee attaches great importance to the procurement work of supply and marketing departments. In April, the county committee issued a notice to the party committees of various communes, specifically arranging the procurement of hogs. Although rice transplanting was in full swing in April, the county procured 1,700 hogs in less than half a month, exceeding the April procurement volume by a large margin.

　　The county also mobilized the masses to actively find and expand sources of goods. In early May, the party branch secretary of the county commercial bureau led five cadres to key communes to help develop diversified operations, resulting in the overfulfillment of the procurement plan. After gaining experience, they held an on-site meeting to promote it throughout the county and extracted another 87 cadres to help cultivate 105 sideline product production bases. These have gradually expanded the sources of goods. Wudong Commune mobilized the masses to establish 27 specialized teams for boiling asphalt, making alkali, and collecting herbs. After carrying out diversified operations, the collected yam alone was worth more than 7,100 yuan.

　　The staff of the Wugang County supply and marketing department also have great enthusiasm. There are 181 peddlers throughout the county going to the countryside, carrying out purchasing and selling business in the fields and canteens. Although the number of employees in the Wudong Commune supply and marketing department has decreased from 54 to 48 in the past, they have still organized 18 peddlers to go to the countryside since April, supplying production materials and living materials worth 19,500 yuan, while also purchasing sideline products worth 16,500 yuan.

### 生猪出槽　油菜丰收　茶叶上市　土产增加  重庆大量采购郊区农副产品  湖南武冈县超额完成第二季度副业产品收购计划

    生猪出槽　油菜丰收　茶叶上市　土产增加
    重庆大量采购郊区农副产品
    湖南武冈县超额完成第二季度副业产品收购计划
    据新华社讯　四川省重庆市和湖南省武冈县大力采购农副产品。重庆市最近两个多月中已经收购生猪四万多头、油菜籽六百二十五万多斤，以及许多小宗工业原料和小杂品。武冈县到5月底止已采购的副业产品（包括副食品和土特产品）总值达四十多万元，提前超额完成了第二季度采购计划。
    据新华社重庆16日电　重庆市商业部门抓紧目前生猪出槽和菜籽、茶叶等上市的季节，加强采购工作。
    今年，巴县、綦江、长寿三县划入重庆市，使重庆市郊区扩大，由郊区供给城市的食品和用品也随着增加。为了及时把农副产品采购到手，重庆市有关各专业公司的负责干部已分别到各区、县、人民公社和管理区去了解情况，安排收购工作。市食品公司、土产公司、油盐糖烟酒公司及各区、县商业部门，都增加了采购人员，改进收购方法，尽量便利公社和农民出售。巴县商业部门组织三百多名干部和一千四百多名小商贩下乡，一面帮助公社收获农产品，一面就地收购。江北区原来只有三个收购点，农民反映路远，出售农副产品不方便，当地商业部门便改用木船沿江流动收购，大大便利了农民。
    在收购中，商业部门干部对农民宣传了农村支援城市的意义，社员们出售农副产品很热情。许多公社把菜籽收割后，马上晒干扬净，卖给国家。全市收购一千四百多万斤菜籽的计划，已经完成将近一半。在最近二十多天中，郊区农民还卖了大量黄席、棕丝、松香油、草帽和其他小杂品给土产公司，支援城市生产和供应城市人民。
    据新华社长沙16日电　中共湖南武冈县委很重视供销部门的采购工作。4月间，县委曾向各公社党委发出通知，具体布置生猪采购工作。4月份虽然插秧正忙，但不到半个月，全县就收购了生猪一千七百头，超过4月份的收购量很多。
    这个县还发动群众积极寻找和扩大货源。5月初，县商业局党支部书记带领五个干部，深入重点公社帮助开展多种经营，结果超额完成了采购计划。他们在取得经验以后，便召开现场会议，在全县推广，又抽出八十七个干部，帮助培植副业产品生产基地一百零五个。这些都逐步地扩大了货源。武东公社发动群众建立熬柏油、土碱、采药等专业队二十七个，开展多种经营以后，仅采集的山药就价值七千一百多元。
    武冈县供销部门职工干劲也很大。全县有一百八十一副货郎担下乡，到田间、食堂开展购销业务。武东公社供销部职工人数虽然由过去五十四人减少到四十八人，但是从4月份以来，仍然组织了十八副货郎担下乡，供应了生产资料和生活资料价值一万九千五百元，同时收购副业产品价值一万六千五百元。（附图片）
