    Correction Regarding "In Memory of Comrade Indian Scholar Ghosh"

    In my article "In Memory of Comrade Indian Scholar Ghosh," published in the People's Daily on May 20th, readers pointed out, and after verification, it was found that Comrade Ghosh (writer and mineralogist S.K. Ghosh), who came to Hangzhou in late September 1957, and Comrade Ajoy Ghosh, the current General Secretary of the Communist Party of India, are indeed two different people. I mistakenly conflated them into one person. I hereby issue this correction and express my apologies.

    对于“怀印度高士同志”一文的更正
    5月20日人民日报刊载拙作，“怀印度高士同志”蒙读者指出，并经查明，1957年9月下旬来杭州的高士同志（作家和矿物学家S．K．高士）和现任印共总书记的阿约艾·高士同志，实系两人。被我混作一人，特此更正，并表歉意。
