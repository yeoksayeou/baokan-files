Through repeated research and layer-by-layer screening, Shanghai is earnestly organizing and researching secret and empirical prescriptions.

(From Our Newspaper) Shanghai is actively carrying out the work of organizing and researching secret and empirical prescriptions on the basis of extensively launching the folk medicine collection movement, adhering to the principle of collecting, organizing, and researching simultaneously.

In January of this year, the Municipal Health Bureau convened a meeting to promptly arrange the work of organizing and researching secret and empirical prescriptions. At present, many districts (counties) and units have published the first collection of empirical prescriptions. Luwan and Penglai districts have also published the second and third collections.

In the process of organizing and researching, the general approach is to combine mass mobilization with the organization of specialized forces, screen layer by layer, compile collections through repeated research and selection, exchange for trial use, and at the same time, organize research experiments with a focus. For example, Luwan District first organizes forces through grassroots units to make preliminary selections and arrangements based on the content of the prescriptions, giving priority to cutting-edge research needs or those with effective and prominent medicinal effects. These are then submitted to the district's folk medicine collection working group for review and selection. In order to do this work well, the District Health Bureau has allocated ten semi-detached traditional Chinese medicine practitioners, veteran pharmacists, and young medical personnel to be specifically responsible for tracing, organizing, identifying, and compiling. Currently, about four thousand prescriptions have been organized, of which more than one thousand five hundred have been printed into two collections of "Collection of Folk Medicine from the Motherland," distributed to relevant medical institutions for reference and trial use. In addition, there are more than eight hundred prescriptions for twenty-one key research disease types, which are being printed into special albums for internal trial use before being promoted if effective. The prescriptions that have not been selected are properly preserved by each unit, ready for further organization and research when conditions permit.

Shanghai Second Medical College first distributes the collected empirical prescriptions to its affiliated hospitals and research units, organizing Chinese and Western medicine physicians from various departments to select them. The prescriptions organized by each unit are then centrally organized and reviewed by the college, and then compiled into collections. Prescriptions that have been clinically proven effective are then edited and promoted.

The Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau has also organized specialized forces to organize the secret and empirical prescriptions collected by directly affiliated units. Currently, five traditional Chinese medicine practitioners detached from production have formed a working group. First, they classify the empirical prescriptions by disease type. Except for prescriptions for cancer, hypertension, traumatology, etc., which are transferred to relevant specialized research institutions such as tumor, hypertension, and traumatology research institutes for organization, they are currently focusing on organizing and researching prescriptions for preventing and treating several common infectious diseases, such as meningitis and dysentery. The method of organization is as follows: First, select prescriptions with relatively complete records of medicinal flavors, dosages, indications, and origins. Analyze and study them based on the records of the prescriptions or the actual circulating efficacy, and whether the medicinal properties and effects are reasonable. Try to conduct follow-up investigations as much as possible, and then compile them into special albums for exchange and trial use. The remaining various prescriptions will also be compiled and selected successively according to the above methods.

    反复研究  逐层筛选
    上海认真整理研究秘方验方
    本报讯  上海市在广泛开展采风运动的基础上，根据边收集、边整理研究的精神，积极开展秘方验方的整理研究工作。
    今年1月市卫生局曾召开会议，对秘方验方的整理研究工作及时作了布置。目前很多区（县）和单位已出版了验方汇编第一辑，卢湾、蓬莱两区，还刊印了第二、第三辑。
    在整理研究过程中，一般都以发动群众和组织专门力量相结合，逐层筛选，通过反复研究审选，辑成汇编，交流试用，同时有重点的组织研究实验。如卢湾区首先通过基层单位，组织力量，根据方子内容，凡属尖端性研究需要，或用之有效、方药作用比较突出的，作初步提选和整理，再交由区的采风工作组进行复核审选。区卫生局为了做好这一工作，调配了十个半脱产的中医师、老年药工和青年医务人员，专门负责追访、整理、鉴定和编选工作。目前已整理出四千张左右的方子除其中一千五百多张已印成“祖国医学采风集”两辑、分发有关医疗机构参考试用外，尚有二十一种重点研究病种的方子八百多张，正在刊印专辑，准备先在内部试用，有效时再作推广。对于没有选出的方子，各单位也妥为保存，准备有条件时再进一步整理研究。
    上海第二医学院将收集到的验方，先发交各附属医院和研究单位，组织各科中西医师进行选择。各单位整理出来的方子，再集中院部整理复审，然后辑成汇编。对临床试用确有实效的方子再编辑推广。
    上海市卫生局对直属单位收集的秘方验方，也组织了专门力量进行整理。现有五个脱离生产的中医，成立了工作组，先将验方按病分类，除癌肿、高血压、伤科等方子转给肿瘤、高血压、伤科研究所等有关专门研究机构整理外，目前正集中力量，先整理研究防治几种常见传染病，如脑膜炎、痢疾等的方子，整理的方法：首先选择药味、剂量、适应症以及来历等记载比较完整的方子，根据方子记载或实际流传的疗效，和药性作用是否合理等情况，加以分析研究，并尽可能地进行追访，然后编成专辑，交流试用。其余各种方子，也将按照上述方法陆续进行编选。
