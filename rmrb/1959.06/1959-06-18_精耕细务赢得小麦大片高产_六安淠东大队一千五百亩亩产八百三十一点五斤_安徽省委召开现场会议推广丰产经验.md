Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 17th: The Pidong People's Commune's Pidong Brigade in Liuan County, Anhui Province, has achieved high yields of wheat over a large area. The brigade has threshed 1,501 mu of wheat, which, after drying and winnowing, yielded an average of 831.5 jin per mu, of which 112.9 mu yielded 1,087 jin per mu. (淠, pronounced Pi, is the name of a river. It is the Pi River, which originates in the southern part of Huoshan County, Anhui Province, flows north through Liuan County, and enters the Huai River at Zhengyangguan.)

The wheat in this large area of high-yield land in Pidong Brigade generally grew uniformly, with many stalks, thick stems, large ears, and plump grains. According to typical surveys, there were an average of 471,000 ears per mu; 60% of the ears had 31 to 40 grains, 28% had 21 to 30 grains, and 12% had 16 to 20 grains. The larger ears had 60 grains each, and the largest ears had more than 80 grains each. This high-yield field was cultivated with particular care from sowing to field management. Before sowing, deep plowing was generally carried out, with 33% plowed to a depth of 8 to 9 inches, 34.5% to a depth of 1 foot, and 2.5% to a depth of about 2 feet; row spacing was 3 to 5 inches; and the sowing amount was 28 to 32 jin, with all seeds being the excellent varieties "Nanda 2419" and "Dwarf Grain More." At the time of sowing, all seeds were selected using mud water, salt water, and lime water immersion, and treated with 666. During the wheat growth period, the field management work of this brigade was also done very well. They fertilized according to different conditions of soil quality, weather, wheat seedlings, and seasons. The methods were: applying base fertilizer in layers and concentrated amounts, diligently checking and observing to skillfully apply top dressing, seizing the time to apply La fertilizer, and carefully supplementing with interplanting fertilizer, so that the wheat could get nutrients in time to meet its needs. The brigade also did a lot of work in preventing lodging. They took measures such as cutting leaves, removing dew, and applying grass ash to prevent lodging in some wheat seedlings that were too crowded or had overgrown due to excessive nitrogen fertilizer application. In the past two months, there have also been six times of force seven gales. The members braved the wind and rain, patrolling the fields day and night, building frames to support the wheat seedlings, and overcoming lodging. Before insect pests occurred, the brigade organized forces to scout day and night, so that they could be discovered and eliminated wherever they were found.

In order to summarize and promote the experience of large-scale high-yield wheat production in Pidong Brigade, the Anhui Provincial Party Committee convened an on-site wheat production meeting in Pidong Brigade, attended by representatives from various special districts, counties, and some communes, state farms, and agricultural technical schools.

    精耕细务赢得小麦大片高产
    六安淠东大队一千五百亩亩产八百三十一点五斤
    安徽省委召开现场会议推广丰产经验
    新华社合肥17日电  安徽省六安县淠东人民公社淠东大队获得小麦大面积高额丰产。这个队已经脱粒一千五百零一亩小麦，经晒干扬净，平均亩产八百三十一点五斤，其中有一百一十二点九亩，亩产达到一千零八十七斤。（淠，音皮，水名。即淠河，源出安徽霍山县南境，北流经六安县，至正阳关入淮。）
    淠东大队这块大面积高额丰产田，小麦普遍生长得整齐均匀，株多，秸粗，穗大，籽粒饱满，根据典型调查，每亩平均有四十七万一千穗，每穗三十一粒至四十粒的占60％，二十一粒至三十粒的占28％，十六粒至二十粒的占12％，比较大的穗子，每穗有六十粒，最大的穗子每穗有八十多粒。这块丰产田，从下种到田间管理都特别细致。在播种前，普遍进行了深耕，深度八寸到九寸的占33％，一尺的占34.5％，二尺左右的占2.5％；行距三寸到五寸；播种量二十八斤至三十二斤，种籽全部是“南大二四一九”和“矮粒多”优良品种。下种时，都经过泥水、盐水选种石灰水浸种和六六六等拌种。小麦生长期间，这个大队的田间管理工作也做得很好。他们根据土质、天时、麦苗、季节等不同情况进行施肥，办法是：分层集中施基肥，勤查四看巧追肥，抓紧时期追腊肥，精心细补插花肥，使麦子及时得到养料，满足需要。在防止倒伏上，这个大队也做了许多工作，他们对一些麦苗过挤或因施氮肥过多，麦苗陡长，有倒伏趋势的采取了割叶、赶露水、追施草木灰等措施加以预防。最近两个月来，这里还遇到六次七级大风，社员们都冒着风雨，日夜在田头巡逻、搭架子扶麦苗，战胜了倒伏。在虫害发生前，大队就组织了力量日夜侦察，做到发现在那里，消灭在那里。
    为了总结和推广淠东大队小麦大面积丰产经验，中共安徽省委曾在淠东大队召开了由各专区、县和部分公社、国营农场、农业技术学校的代表参加的小麦丰产现场会议。
