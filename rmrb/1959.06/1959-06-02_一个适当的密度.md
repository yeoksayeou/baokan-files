    An Appropriate Density
    By our correspondent Jiang Weicai
    The earth has fallen asleep, and the people who have labored all day have entered the realm of dreams. Only the thatched hut of the production team meeting room is still bustling with activity. Under the lamplight, a dozen or so male and female commune members are seated, including elderly, middle-aged, and young people. Inside the room, there are intermittent loud voices from the men and the unique high-pitched tones of the women, sometimes interspersed with the clamor of arguments... These are the members of the production team discussing the problem of close planting of rice.
    For the past few days, the members of the Second Production Team of the Construction Management Area of the Sanmao Commune in Yangzhong County have been discussing the issue of close planting of rice. People of different ages hold various different opinions and views, some advocating close planting, some advocating sparse planting, and some advocating neither too dense nor too sparse.
    The day for transplanting rice seedlings is approaching. What density is appropriate? Which approach is best? Production Team Leader Liu Jifu couldn't make up his mind for a while. He thought: Now that the yields are all contracted to the production team, the decision on each yield-increasing measure is directly related to the interests of the commune members, and the issue of close planting of rice is what the masses are most concerned about. If one person makes the decision without consulting with the masses, not only will things be done poorly, and the masses will be dissatisfied, but if the density is inappropriate and causes a reduction in production, that would be terrible. He decided to find some representative elderly, middle-aged, and young commune members in the production team and let everyone discuss it democratically to make a decision.
    Under a dim kerosene lamp, Captain Liu, with a smiling face, said earnestly: "I've asked everyone to come here for no other reason than to discuss how to plant the rice, whether it should be planted more densely or more sparsely..." As soon as he finished speaking, Zhou Changgao, a white-haired man in his fifties, rushed to be the first to speak: "Rice cannot be planted too densely, because if it is too dense, it will lodge and reduce production... Last year, over 40 mu of Huangke rice in the Forty-first Weir were planted early at 3x5 (more than 40,000 holes per mu), and more than 20 mu suffered severe lodging, resulting in reduced production." Zhou Changcai, an old man sitting next to him, also nodded repeatedly, expressing his agreement with this view. He continued Zhou Changgao's words, saying: "I have been farming for decades, and I have always planted in a haphazard manner (i.e., 7x8, more than 10,000 holes per mu), only applying three plowshares of seedling grass (green manure) and one application of pig manure each year. In good years, one mu of land can yield four to five hundred jin of rice. Planting forty to fifty thousand holes per mu is not something to play around with."
    Once the conversation was opened, everyone freely poured out their different opinions and views. Old farmer Zhou Haoqin said: "In the past, in normal years, planting haphazardly at 7x8 rarely yielded four to five hundred jin of rice per mu; generally, only three hundred jin or so were harvested per mu. Sparse planting definitely cannot increase production." Then, several young people also gave reasons, saying: "Last year, some rice did lodge, but the reason for the lodging cannot be entirely attributed to dense planting. The reasons for lodging include improper fertilization and non-standard deep plowing, resulting in a very rotten surface layer of soil and a very hard layer of soil below, so the rice plants do not take root, and there are often winds and rain when the ears emerge." As soon as Zhou Changgao heard this, he immediately retorted: "Why are the rice plants on the edge of the embankment thicker and have larger ears, and do not lodge? Isn't it because the plants on the edge are sparse!" After a moment of thought, several young people said as if they had found a scientific basis: "The rice plants on the edge of the embankment are also thicker and have larger ears than those in the field because the edge of the embankment has better ventilation and light than the field, which has nothing to do with sparse planting."
    Zhao Jiabin, in his thirties, listened to everyone's arguments, thinking about something. When everyone's argument came to an end, he grinned and said as if he were summarizing: "Close planting is good, but too close is not good. What about too sparse? There are also problems." In order to make his reasons stand, he continued: "Last year, eight mu of glutinous rice in the Thirty-fifth Weir were planted at 6x6 because people were busy at the time. I saw that the growth was not bad and there was no lodging. Before harvesting, the commune members behind the dam all gave a thumbs up and said that they would harvest twice as much as the lodging rice in the Forty-first Weir. What happened? Only more than 400 jin of rice were harvested per mu, while the lodging rice in the Forty-first Weir yielded more than 500 jin per mu, more than 100 jin more." His words gave everyone a great inspiration. People who originally held different opinions further compared and calculated the past, especially last year's sparsely planted, densely planted, and neither too densely nor too sparsely planted rice, based on facts and figures. After a calculation and comparison, everyone's mind became clear.
    When everyone's opinions became close to agreement, the captain guided everyone to discuss what to do with this year's rice. Zhou Changcai, who originally advocated sparse planting, said: "I think it's better to plant a little denser, 4x5 is the most suitable, and any denser won't work." Liu Guofa rushed to say: "It can't be generalized; it depends on the variety. For some varieties, 4x5 is more reasonable, and for others, 3x5 is more reasonable." Everyone agreed with Liu Guofa's opinion.
    After repeated discussions, based on past experience and specific conditions such as soil, water, fertilizer, and seeds, everyone determined the standard for rational close planting of rice in this year's production team. The standard decided by everyone was: Manggang rice should be planted at 3x5, with 40,000 holes per mu and eight to ten plants per hole. Tugang rice, because it grows larger, should be planted slightly more sparsely than Manggang rice, at 4x5, with 37,000 holes per mu and six to seven plants per hole. Early glutinous rice should also be planted at 4x5. At the meeting, everyone also enthusiastically discussed specific yield-increasing measures such as deep plowing and fertilization, as well as technical issues such as pest and disease prevention and lodging prevention.
    These elderly, middle-aged, and young commune members, because they freely expressed their thoughts at the meeting, were very satisfied with the rational close planting standard set by the collective. The commune members said: "This is the method we came up with ourselves, and we will definitely transplant rice seedlings according to this standard."

    一个适当的密度
    本报记者　姜韦才
    大地沉睡了，劳动一天的人们，已经进入梦境。只有生产队会议室的茅屋里还是热闹非常。灯光
  下，坐着十几个男女社员，有老年人、中年人、青年人。屋里，时而发出男人粗大的讲话声和女人特有的尖高音，时而夹着争执的喧嚷声……这是生产队的社员们正在讨论水稻密植问题。
    几天来，扬中县三茅公社建设管理区第二生产队的社员，对水稻密植问题议论纷纷。不同年岁的人，持有各种不同的意见和见解，有的主张密植，有的主张稀植，有的主张既不要过密，也不要过稀。
    插秧的日子临近了，到底多大的密度为宜呢？采取那一种主张好呢？生产队长刘纪福一时拿不定主意。他想：现在的产量都包到生产队了，决定每一项增产措施跟社员有直接的利害关系，而水稻密植问题又是群众最关心的事情，如果一个人作决定，不同群众商量着办，不独会把事情办坏，群众不满意，而且万一密度不当，造成减产，那就糟糕了。他决定把生产队里有代表性的老年、中年和青年社员找到一块，让大家民主讨论作出决定。
    在一盏不大明亮的煤油灯下，满面笑容的刘队长恳切地说：“请大家来，没别的，就是议论一下水稻怎么个栽法，是密一些还是稀一些……”他的话刚一落声，五十多岁的花白头发的周长高抢着头一个发言：“稻子插得不能密，密了会倒伏，会减产……去年，四十一圩四十多亩黄壳，早插了3×5
  （每亩四万多穴），倒伏严重的就有二十多亩，结果减了产。”坐在一旁的周长才老汉也连连点头，表示同意这个看法，他接住周长高的话说：“我种了几十年田，一直是插的横七竖八（即7×8，每亩一万多穴），每年只垩上三犁头秧草（绿肥），施一次猪灰，碰上好年成，一亩田就能收到四五百斤稻谷。每亩密植四五万穴，那可不能玩。”
    话匣子打开以后。每个人都心情舒畅地倾吐自己的不同意见，不同见解。老农周浩钦说：“过去正常年景，插横七竖八的，每亩收四五百斤稻谷的，很少见，一般每亩只收到三百多斤，稀植肯定不能增产。”接着好几个青年也举出理由说：“去年是有些稻子倒伏了，可不能把倒伏的原因都推到密植上去。倒伏的原因，有的是施肥不当深耕也不合规格，结果上面一层表土烂得很，下面的泥土硬得很，稻棵不扎根，吐穗时又常常刮风下雨。”周长高一听这话，立即反驳说：“为什么岸界边上的稻子棵头粗，穗头大，不倒伏，还不是因为边上的棵头稀！”几个青年一琢磨，像找到科学根据似地说：“稀植前岸土边上的稻子也比田里边的棵头粗，穗头大，都是因为岸土边上比田里边通风透光好，这跟稀植没有关系。”
    三十多岁的赵家斌，一面听着大家的争论，一面若有所思地在想着什么问题。当大家的争论告一段落时，他咧着嘴像做总结似地说：“密植是好的，过密就不好，过稀呢？也有问题。”他为了使自己的理由立得住足，紧接着说：“去年三十五圩一块八亩田糯稻，因为当时人手忙，插的6×6，我看了长的很不差，也没倒伏。收割以前，埭埭后的社员都伸出大拇指头说，要比四十一圩那块倒伏的稻子多收一倍，结果呢？每亩只收到稻子四百多斤，而四十一圩那块倒伏的稻每亩却收到五百多斤，多收了百十斤。”他的这番话给了大家很大启发。原来持有不同意见的人，都进一步有根有据地把过去特别是去年稀植、密植、不过密也不过稀的稻子，进行对比算账，经过一算一比，每个人的心里豁的亮堂了。
    在大家的意见接近一致时，队长引导大家讨论今年的水稻该怎么办。原来主张稀植的周长才说：“我看还是稍密一点好，4×5最合适，再密不行。”刘国发抢着说：“那可不能一概而论，要看什么品种，有的品种4×5比较合理，有的品种3×5才比较合理。”大家都同意刘国发的意见。
    经过反复讨论后，大家根据过去的经验和土、水、肥、种等具体情况，确定了今年生产队水稻合理密植的标准。大家议断的标准是：芒刚稻插3×5，每亩四万穴，每穴八到十株。土刚稻因为发棵大，比芒刚稻稍稀一点，插4×5，每亩三万七千穴，每穴六至七株。早糯稻也插4×5。会上，大家还热烈地具体讨论了深耕、施肥等增产措施和防治虫病害、防倒伏等技术问题。
    这些老年、中年、青年社员，由于在会上畅所欲言表达了自己的想法，所以对集体定出合理密植标准，十分满意。社员们：“这是我们自己定出来的办法，一定照着这个规格插秧”。
