Continue to Launch Mass Movements on the Industrial Front
Yang Yongzhi

The most fundamental experience we gained on the industrial front in 1958 was launching mass movements under the leadership of the Party. This experience should be continuously enriched and further developed in this year's and future work.

China is an economically poor and backward country. It is impossible to transform poverty into prosperity and backwardness into advancement without carrying out an industrial revolution. To carry out an industrial revolution, we must rely on hundreds of millions of people, that is, we must launch mass movements on a large scale.

Both See the Role of People and See the Role of Things

The problem to be solved by the industrial revolution is, first of all, the problem of people producing more and richer material resources with better production tools and higher production skills. Therefore, launching mass movements on the industrial front is a movement of technical innovation and technical revolution by thousands of workers. With the change of production tools, people's labor skills, production experience, and ability to use production tools are also improved and developed. With the transformation of production tools, and the development of labor experience and skills, the possibility of producing abundant material resources arises. In this great struggle, it is wrong not to see the role of "things," not to see the role of production tools, raw materials, machine materials, and so on. The purpose of our mass movement is to change the poverty of material wealth. We are materialists, and it is obviously wrong not to see the changes of "things" or not to pay attention to the changes of "things."

However, who ultimately creates all material wealth, who accumulates all labor experience, who masters the most advanced labor skills, and who transforms and remodels all kinds of production tools? In the final analysis, the improvement and development of social productive forces cannot be achieved without people and without human labor. People are the most active and important factor in productive forces. People are the initiators of production tools, and people are the producers of material resources. Without human labor, there would be no abundant material wealth. As the saying goes: "It is up to people to make things happen" and "Nothing is difficult in the world for those who set their minds to it." Therefore, while the idea of "seeing people but not seeing things" is certainly wrong, the view of "seeing things but not seeing people" is especially wrong.

Strengthen Political and Ideological Work Among the Masses

To launch mass movements on a large scale on the industrial front, we must do a great job of working on people. What kind of work should we do on people? Naturally, it is to do people's political and ideological work. That is to say, to launch mass movements on a large scale, and to do a great job of working on people, we must, in accordance with this, launch political and ideological movements on a large scale, and launch Marxist-Leninist education movements on a large scale. Because people not only affect nature in production, but also affect each other. If the relationship between people in production is a relationship of mutual assistance, cooperation, and collectivism, then this kind of production relationship can rapidly promote the growth of social productive forces. If the relationship between people is one of individualism and selfishness, it cannot promote the improvement of social productive forces. In industry, in our revolutionary struggle for industrialization, there are those with revolutionary drive and those without, those who are conservative and backward and those who are advanced and progressive, and a relationship is formed between them. This relationship is reflected in production, because they achieve social production with different purposes and methods. There are also those who treat production with a bureaucratic attitude, those who are dispirited and lose their revolutionary spirit, and those who are half-hearted or indecisive. There are also those who have soaring enthusiasm but lack a realistic and scientific analysis, and those who are lukewarm and lack revolutionary drive. There are also those who are brave and fearless, dare to think and dare to do, and those who are like women with bound feet, full of worries, and swaying from side to side. All these ideologies and ways of thinking affect the development of social production to varying degrees, affect the progress and development of mass movements, and affect the play of mass creativity and initiative. Therefore, to launch mass movements on a large scale on the industrial front, we must at the same time greatly strengthen the Party's political and ideological work in order to ensure the healthy and vigorous development of the movement.

To do the work on people, we must care for people, care for the workers' thoughts, lives, production skills, and care for everything about the masses. The development of social production cannot be automatically completed by mindless machines; social production must be completed by people. People are the ones who start the machines, operate the machines, and manufacture the machines. If people are passive and backward, the machines will also be passive and backward. If people become active and advanced, the machines will also become active and advanced. Therefore, anyone who is enthusiastic about the development of social production should enthusiastically care for people, and anyone who is enthusiastic about mass movements on the industrial front should enthusiastically care for people.

Carry Out Cultural Revolution and Technical Revolution

Mass movements on the industrial front are a movement for the broad masses to understand the objective laws of social production development. We have understood part of the objective laws of development of production, but there are still many objective laws that we do not understand. The history of social development is the history of the producers of material resources themselves. Only when thousands of producers of material resources act, everyone fully plays their subjective initiative, and everyone strives to understand, grasp, and apply the laws of social production development, can our social productive forces develop rapidly. To understand the objective laws of social production requires culture and scientific knowledge, and to grasp and apply them requires new technologies. Therefore, to launch mass movements on a large scale on the industrial front, we need to make a big noise in the cultural revolution and a big noise in the technical revolution. We must accept the experience of our predecessors and the experience of foreigners, but we must not be bound by these experiences. Because the objective laws of social production development, although they have their universality, also have their particularity. Without proceeding from the particularity of things, applying an unchangeable formula everywhere will only lead to a rigid and inflexible understanding. Some people believe that it is impossible to increase the speed of spindles in cotton mills, because the internationally prescribed critical line is that one spindle can only be rotated from 9,000 to 13,000 revolutions per minute, and more is impossible. However, in 1958, the spindle speed of many of our cotton mills was increased from 15,000 to 16,000 revolutions per minute. The speed increased, the efficiency increased, the output increased, and the quality improved, and the internationally prescribed critical line was broken. If you ask why, the reason is that when we understand the laws of social production development, we use the power of the masses, and we use the combination of foreign and indigenous methods, the combination of the near and the far, the combination of the large and the small, the combination of cadres, workers, and technicians, the combination of the minority and the majority, and the combination of technical revolution and cultural revolution. As a result, dogmatism was broken, old experiences were broken through, and new experiences were created.

The broad masses carry out technical revolution in all aspects, such as operating methods, production tools, and product design, and use cultural and scientific knowledge to gradually realize the mechanization and automation of manual operations and mechanical equipment. This is the main content of launching mass movements on a large scale on the industrial front. Without this content, there can be no mass movements on the industrial front.

Disclose the "Bottom Line" to the Masses and Let the Masses Be the Masters

To launch mass movements on a large scale on the industrial front is to follow the mass line on a large scale. The mass line is our Party's lifeline. Contact with the workers and close contact with all proletarians is the fundamental key to doing a good job in mass movements. It is not enough to rely solely on the experience of leaders to implement the industrial revolution. We must supplement the experience of leaders with the experience of the workers.

To implement the Party's mass line on the industrial front, we must have the spirit of first being students of the masses and then being teachers of the masses. That is, we must both learn from the masses and educate the masses. Without humbly learning from the masses, we cannot follow the mass line. Without being good at understanding the thoughts and lives of the masses, and without being good at using communist principles to educate, enlighten, and raise the awareness of the masses, we still cannot follow the mass line. The more we learn from the masses, the more we have the spirit of equality and the communist style, the more we can connect with them. The more we can educate the masses, the higher the communist awareness of the masses, and the more we can connect with them. Therefore, to launch mass movements on a large scale in factories and enterprises, leading cadres must continue to carry forward the spirit of rectification, go deep into the front line, go deep into the masses, become familiar with the masses, become familiar with production, and participate in labor for a part of the time, so as to better integrate with the masses.

To follow the mass line and closely contact the masses, we should disclose the "bottom line" to the masses. We should clearly explain our ideals, production plans for a certain period, technical measures, and the favorable and unfavorable factors for realizing the plans to the masses, and let the masses discuss, revise, and supplement them. The purpose of disclosing the "bottom line" is to make the numbers in the minds of the leaders become the numbers in the minds of the masses, and to supplement the numbers in the minds of the leaders with the numbers in the minds of the masses. The mastery of production laws is a minority when one person or a few people have the numbers in their minds, and the minority is often incomplete and not thorough. The majority have the numbers in their minds when the masses have the numbers in their minds. The combination of leaders and the masses, from the minority to the majority, will inevitably lead to a change in things or understanding from quantity to quality. When the masses have the numbers in their minds, the masses become the masters of production. It is better for the majority of the masses to be the masters of production than for one person or a few people to be the masters of production. When the majority of the masses become the masters of production, the subjective initiative of the masses can be consciously developed, so that they can consciously learn culture, study technology, tap potential, overcome difficulties, and realize continuous changes and continuous leaps forward in production with an advanced and practical attitude.

After the Shanghai No. 13 State-owned Cotton Mill increased the speed of the spindles, the yarn broke a lot. Sometimes almost all the yarn on a machine would break, leaving only one strand. However, once the masses became aware and became the masters of production, the broad masses rose up and fought to reduce the number of yarn breaks. The workers in the mechanical and maintenance departments fought to eliminate mechanical yarn breaks, the female workers operating the machines fought to improve their operating skills, the young workers fought to supply machine materials, and the workers in other workshops fought to support the fine yarn workshop. The whole factory, from top to bottom, everyone played their subjective initiative, and everyone engaged in technical revolution and operating revolution. As a result, the speed of the spindles increased, the number of yarn breaks decreased, the efficiency increased, and the output increased. Isn't this another vivid example?

Frequently Put Forward Slogans That Encourage the Masses

The slogans of mass movements on the industrial front should be changed at any time according to different situations, different conditions, different progress levels of the movement, and different natures of contradictions. We must be good at putting forward slogans that are relevant to the current situation, have attractive power, and constantly encourage the masses to move from one victory to another.

In 1958, the beginning of the mass movement on the industrial front in Shanghai put forward the slogan of major rectification and major transformation. Then it put forward the slogan of catching up with the United Kingdom in fifteen years, then it put forward the slogan of opposing conservatism and opposing waste, then it put forward the slogan of comparing with the advanced and catching up with the advanced, comparing with more, faster, better and more economical results, then it put forward the slogan of continuing rectification and transformation, and making a big noise in the technical revolution, and then it put forward the slogan of leaping forward again. Under the attraction of this series of slogans, the broad masses of workers and staff threw themselves into the production struggle in different periods. The putting forward of these slogans reflected the struggle process of constantly emerging new contradictions and constantly resolving new contradictions. The same is true in a factory or enterprise. When there is a contradiction between the quality and quantity of production, we should guide the masses to solve the problem of product quality. When labor productivity is in an extremely low state, we should guide the masses to engage in technical revolution and operating revolution to improve labor productivity. When the relationship between people, between leaders and the masses, is in an abnormal state, we should carry out rectification, overcome the three styles and five airs, and transform the relations of production. When the contradiction between the factory's management work and workshop production becomes a prominent problem, we should improve production management and implement two participations and one reform. When the targets are set too low and conservative ideas appear, we should oppose conservatism and establish advanced targets. When the targets are set too high, are not practical, and exceed the extent allowed by objective conditions, we should advocate a combination of hot and cold, and advocate scientific analysis.

The in-depth development of mass movements is a process of repeated struggle in which the contradictions of things constantly emerge, are constantly overcome, and are constantly unified. If we want to lead the mass movement on the industrial front excellently, we must learn to use dialectics, and learn to recognize contradictions, expose contradictions, and solve contradictions. To launch mass movements on a large scale on the industrial front is a movement for thousands of workers to learn to recognize and solve contradictions in the struggle of contradictions. The dialectical development of this movement will greatly improve the practical application of the materialist dialectics of the Chinese working class, and the concrete application of Marxism-Leninism in developing social production.

    在工业战线上继续大搞群众运动
    杨永直
    1958年我国在工业战线上取得的最根本的一条经验，就是在党的领导下大搞群众运动。这条经验，应该在今年和今后的工作中不断充实，继续发扬光大。
    我国在经济上是一个贫穷落后的国家，要变贫穷为富强，落后为先进，不进行工业革命是万万不行的。要进行工业革命，就不能不依靠亿万群众，也就是不能不大搞群众运动。
    既见人的作用、又见物的作用
    工业革命所要解决的问题，首先是人们用更好的生产工具和更高的生产技能生产出更多更丰富的物质资料的问题。因此在工业战线上大搞群众运动，也就是千千万万的劳动者的技术革新和技术革命的运动。随着生产工具的变革，人们的劳动技能，生产经验，运用生产工具的本领也随之提高和发展起来。生产工具变革了，劳动经验、劳动技能发展了，那么丰富的物质资料的产生就有了可能。在这一伟大的斗争中，看不见“物”的作用，看不见生产工具、原材料、机物料等等的作用是不对的。我们大闹群众运动的目的，就是要改变物质财富的贫困状况。我们是唯物论者，看不见“物”的变化，或不重视“物”的变化，那显然是不对的。
    可是，一切物质财富究竟由谁创造，一切劳动经验由谁来积累，最先进的劳动技能究竟由谁来掌握，各色各样的生产工具究竟由谁去变革、改造？归根结蒂，社会生产力的提高和发展，离开人，离开人的劳动就什么也办不成功。人是生产力中最活跃最重要的因素。人是生产工具的发动者，人是物质资料的生产者。没有人的劳动就没有丰富的物质财富。俗话说：“事在人为”“天下无难事，只怕有心人”。所以“见人不见物”的观念固然不对，“见物不见人”的观点则尤其错误。
    加强对群众的政治思想工作
    要在工业战线上大搞群众运动就要大做人的工作。做人的什么工作呢？自然是做人的政治思想工作。那就是说，要大搞群众运动，大做人的工作，就必须与之相适应，大搞政治思想运动，大搞马克思列宁主义的教育运动。因为人们在生产中不仅影响着自然界，而且彼此互相影响。如果人们在生产中的相互关系是一种互助合作、集体主义的关系，那么这种生产关系，就能迅速的促进社会生产力的增长。如果人们之间的关系是一种个人主义、自私自利的关系，那就不能促进社会生产力的提高。搞工业，在我国工业化的革命斗争中，有有革命干劲的和没有革命干劲的，有保守落后的和先进、进取的，他们之间都形成一种关系。这种关系无不反映在生产上，因为他们是以不同的目的和方法来实现社会生产的。对待生产还有摆老爷态度的，还有垂头丧气丧失革命气概的，还有半心半意或是三心二意的。也有具有冲天干劲但缺乏实事求是科学分析的，也有只冷不热缺乏革命干劲的。也有勇往直前，不怕困难，敢想、敢做的，也有如小脚女人，顾虑重重，东摇西摆的。这一切意识形态，思想方法，无不在各种程度上影响着社会生产的发展，无不影响着群众运动的前进和发展，无不影响着群众的创造性和积极性的发挥。因此，要在工业战线上大搞群众运动，就要同时大大加强党的政治思想工作，才能保证运动健康地蓬勃地发展。
    要做人的工作，就要关心人，关心工人群众的思想、生活、生产技能，关心群众的一切。社会生产的发展，不是没有思想的机器能够自动完成的，社会生产是要人去完成的。人是开动机器、操纵机器、制造机器的，人消极了，落后了，机器也就消极了，落后了，人积极起来，先进起来，机器也就积极起来，先进起来。所以凡是热心社会生产发展的，就应该热烈地关心人，凡是热心于工业战线上的群众运动的，就应该热烈地关心人。
    进行文化革命和技术革命
    工业战线上的群众运动是广大群众认识社会生产发展客观规律的运动。发展生产的客观规律我们认识了一部分，但还有很多客观规律我们并不懂得。社会发展的历史是物质资料生产者本身的历史，只有千千万万的物质资料生产者行动起来，人人充分发挥主观能动作用，人人努力去认识社会生产发展的规律，掌握它，并运用它，才能使我国的社会生产力高速度向前发展。要认识社会生产的客观规律需要文化、科学知识，要掌握它、运用它则需要新的技术。因此，在工业战线上大搞群众运动，就需要大闹文化革命，大闹技术革命。我们要接受前人的经验和外国人的经验，但千万不能被这些经验所束缚。因为社会生产发展的客观规律，虽有其普遍性，但还有其特殊性。不从事物的特殊性出发，千篇一律地使用一种不可改变的公式到处乱套，那么认识只能是枯槁的和僵硬的东西。有人认为在棉纺厂里加快车速是不行的，因为国际规定的临界线一分钟一锭只能由九千转到一万三千转，再多是不可能的了。可是在1958年，我们许多棉纺厂的锭速却由一分钟一锭的一万五千转转到一万六千转。速度加快了，效率提高了，产量增加了，质量也好了，国际规定的临界线打破了。若问为什么如此，究其原因，是我们在认识社会生产发展规律的时候，运用了群众的力量，运用了群众所创造的洋土结合、远近结合、大小结合、干部、工人、技术人员结合、少数和多数结合、技术革命和文化革命相结合的结果。于是教条主义被冲破了，老经验被突破了，新的经验被创造出来。
    广大群众从操作方法、生产工具、产品设计等各方面进行技术革命，并运用文化科学知识使手工操作、机械设备逐步实现机械化、自动化，这是在工业战线上大搞群众运动的主要内容，离开这个内容，就不可能有工业战线上的群众运动。
    向群众交“底”要群众作主人
    在工业战线上大搞群众运动，就是大走群众路线。群众路线是我们党的生命线。与工人的联系与全体无产者的亲密联系是搞好群众运动的根本关键。实行工业革命只靠领导者的经验是不够的，必须以工人群众的经验来补充领导者的经验。
    在工业战线上要贯彻执行党的群众路线，必须要有先做群众学生，再做群众先生的精神。即既要向群众学习，又要教育群众。不虚心向群众学习，不能走群众路线，不善于了解群众的思想情况、生活情况，不善于运用共产主义的原则去教育启发、提高群众的觉悟，仍然不能走群众路线。我们同群众的联系，愈能向他们学习，愈具有平等待人的精神和共产主义的风格，就愈能联系他们；愈能教育群众，群众共产主义的觉悟愈高，也就愈能联系他们。因此，要在工厂企业里大搞群众运动，领导干部就必须继续发扬整风精神，深入现场，深入群众，熟悉群众，熟悉生产，以一部分时间参加劳动，更好的和群众打成一片。
    要走群众路线，密切联系群众，应当向群众交“底”，应当把我们的理想，一定时期的生产计划，技术措施，实现计划的有利条件和不利因素向群众交代清楚，放手发动群众讨论、修改、补充。交“底”的目的，是使领导心中之数成为群众心中之数，以群众心中之数补充领导心中之数。对于生产规律的掌握，一人或少数人心中有数是少数，少数往往是不全面、不透彻的。群众心中有数是多数，领导同群众结合，由少数到多数必将引起事物或认识由量到质的变化。群众心中有了数，群众成为生产的主人。一人当主人，少数人当主人，不如多数人当主人来得好。群众的多数当了生产的主人，群众的主观能动性就能自觉的发扬起来，从而自觉地学习文化，钻研技术，挖掘潜力，战胜困难，以先进而又切实的姿态实现生产上的不断变革，不断跃进。
    上海国棉十三厂，加快车速之后，细纱断的很多，有时一台车细纱几乎全部断光，只剩下一根。可是一当群众觉悟起来，当了生产的主人，广大群众就振臂而起，为降低断头而斗争，机动、保全部门工人为消灭机械断头而战，挡车女工为提高操作水平而战，青年工人为供应机物料而战，其他车间工人为支援细纱间而战。全厂上下，人人发挥了主观能动性，个个搞技术革命，操作革命，结果，车速加快了，断头降低了，效率提高了，产量增加了，这岂不又是生动的一例么？
    经常提出鼓舞群众的口号
    工业战线上群众运动的口号要随着不同的情况，不同的条件，和运动不同的进展程度，不同性质的矛盾，随时变换，要善于提出切中时弊，富有吸引力量，不断鼓舞群众从一个胜利走到另一个胜利的口号。
    1958年，上海工业战线上群众运动的开始，提出了大整大改的口号。继之又提出十五年赶上英国的口号，继之又提出反保守、反浪费的口号，继之又提出比先进赶先进比多快好省的口号，继之又提出继续整改，大闹技术革命的口号，继之又提出跃进再跃进的口号。广大职工群众，在这一系列的口号吸引下，投入不同时期的生产斗争。这些口号的提出，反映了不断出现新的矛盾，不断解决新的矛盾的斗争过程。在一个工厂、企业里同样如此。当生产质和量发生矛盾的时候，就应当引导群众解决产品质量问题。当劳动生产率处于极端低下的状况的时候，就应当引导群众搞技术革命，操作革命，来提高劳动生产率。当人与人之间，领导与群众之间的关系处于不正常的状况的时候，就应当进行整风，克服三风五气，变革生产关系。当工厂的管理工作与车间生产的矛盾成为突出问题的时候，就应当改进生产管理，实行两参一改。当指标提得过低，出现保守思想的时候，就应当反对保守，树立先进的指标。当指标提得过高，不切合实际，超越客观条件的允许程度的时候，就应当提倡冷热结合，提倡科学分析。
    群众运动的深入发展是事物矛盾不断出现，不断克服，不断统一的反复斗争的过程。如果要出色的领导工业战线上的群众运动，就必须学会运用辩证法，学会认识矛盾，揭露矛盾，解决矛盾的本领。在工业战线上大搞群众运动，是成千成万的工人群众在矛盾的斗争中学会认识矛盾、解决矛盾的运动，这一运动的辩证发展，将大大提高我国工人阶级唯物辩证主义的实际运用，和马克思列宁主义在发展社会生产上的具体运用。
