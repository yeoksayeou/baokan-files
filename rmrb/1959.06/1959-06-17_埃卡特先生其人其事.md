    Mr. Eckardt: The Man and His Deeds
    Hu Sisheng

    In Geneva's journalistic circles, Mr. Eckardt, a member of the West German delegation and its chief press officer, is quite renowned. It is said that among many journalists in Geneva, when people meet, they often don't exchange greetings like "Hello" or "Good day," but instead ask: "What nonsense has Eckardt spouted now?"

    "What brilliant theories does Eckardt have?" one journalist greets another.

    "I heard that Eckardt asserted at a press conference that the overthrow of the Weimar Republic was the work of the communists, and definitely not the work of Hitler's followers."

    "That was his masterpiece yesterday. Today he openly declared that unless the Soviet Union accepts the West's proposed solution to the West Berlin problem, the summit conference will certainly fail."

    Eckardt holds the official position of Head of the Press and Information Office in Adenauer's government in West Germany. In Bonn, Eckardt has a large staff under him. Not long ago, due to his "outstanding achievements," the office spent a huge amount of money to build a high-rise building in Bonn. Locals are accustomed to calling it the "Propaganda Department," because people still remember Goebbels' actions when he was in charge of Hitler's "Propaganda Department." For this foreign ministers' conference, Eckardt was ordered to lead his big and small bosses to Geneva. It may be hard to believe, but Eckardt and his subordinates account for half of the total number of the West German delegation. This is the origin of the term "Eckardt's gang" in Geneva.

    In the streets of Geneva, at press conferences of various delegations, in the Palais des Nations, and in the press center, "Eckardt's gang" can be seen everywhere. They rush around day and night, their task being: to collect information, study the climate, and spread rumors with specific purposes. For different journalists, they have "interesting news" specially prepared. However, although the activity methods are varied, they all follow an "Adenauer line": to do their best to slander the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic's claims and positions at the foreign ministers' conference, and to spread rumors that the meeting is in a "crisis," "at a dead end," or "has already collapsed."

    At every official press conference of the West German delegation, Mr. Eckardt always shows up and says a few words. However, his main arena of activity is at another type of "behind-the-scenes press conference." These behind-the-scenes receptions are held almost daily at his villa, and only carefully selected West German journalists are allowed to enter. At this meeting, Eckardt not only issues general instructions, but also stipulates the content of the news and the headlines of tomorrow's newspapers. For example, a few days ago, when the foreign ministers were focusing on discussing the West Berlin issue, and even some people in the Western camp had to admit that the situation in West Berlin was abnormal, Eckardt, fearing that the West would not be able to hold the line, immediately took action through "behind-the-scenes press conferences." The next day, the West German newspapers had eye-catching headlines such as: "Western countries take a tough stance in Geneva," "Gromyko's uncompromising stance prompts the West to take a tough approach," and so on. Not only that, but the West German news agency hurriedly sent out the following news: U.S. Secretary of State Herter had "lost patience" and was scheduled to return home on June 6. But the U.S. delegation has not left Geneva yet.

    Eckardt takes it as his responsibility to obstruct the holding of a summit conference. So the West German newspapers were ordered to quote "reliable sources" and assert that the idea of a summit conference had been buried. Mr. Eckardt also pioneered the brilliant theory of holding a "lowest-level meeting." "Eckardt's gang" declared in Geneva that after the foreign ministers' conference, holding a meeting of assistant foreign ministers would be timely, and that holding a meeting of ambassadors would be even more realistic.

    What gives Eckardt a headache is the three-colored flag of the German Democratic Republic flying on Foreign Minister Bolz's car. Not long ago, a member of the delegation of the German Democratic Republic, First Deputy Minister of Defense Hoffmann, held a press conference in Geneva and refuted the lies spread by the West German delegation and "Eckardt's gang" about the "militarization of the German Democratic Republic." Eckardt was very annoyed, but unable to refute it, so he resorted to the trick of "borrowing a knife to kill someone." A few days later, some Swiss newspapers published slanderous voices against the German Democratic Republic. The "Journal de Genève" even published an article entitled "Unpleasant People," expressing annoyance at Foreign Minister Bolz sitting with other foreign ministers, and making rude attacks. On the other hand, the management office of the "Maison de la Presse" in Geneva also came forward and wrote a letter specifically to the delegation of the German Democratic Republic, accusing the German Democratic Republic of "abusing" the rules of the "Maison de la Presse" and "messing around" there, and so on. However, because Eckardt was in a hurry, his methods were too clumsy. The letter written to the German Democratic Republic in the name of the "Maison de la Presse" was even distributed to the public before the other party had responded, and even the ignorant people saw through the mystery. After that, new jokes were added to the discussions about Eckardt.

    Recently, Adenauer decided to remain as Chancellor. Eckardt made a special trip back to the country to see him, and said upon returning to Geneva that he was currently "somewhat pessimistic." Originally, it would be a miracle for anyone who accepted Adenauer's instructions to feel "optimistic" about the foreign ministers' conference. As the saying goes: birds of a feather flock together. It is no coincidence that Eckardt has become Adenauer's confidant, a vanguard in the West's sabotage of the foreign ministers' conference. (Attached image)

    埃卡特先生其人其事
    胡思升
    在日内瓦的新闻界，西德代表团成员兼首席新闻发布官埃卡特先生颇负盛名。据说，在日内瓦的许多记者当中，人们见面时往往不说“您好”、“日安”之类的寒暄话，而代之以这样的问话：“埃卡特又扯了些什么”。
    “埃卡特又有什么妙论？”一个记者向另一记者打招呼。
    “听说埃卡特在记者招待会上断言：当年魏玛共和国之被颠复系共产党人所为，绝非出于希特勒党徒之手”。
    “这是他昨天的杰作。今天他公开宣称，除非苏联接受西方所提解决西柏林问题的方案，最高级会议定将告吹”。
    埃卡特在西德官居阿登纳政府报刊和情报处长之职。在波恩，埃卡特手下拥有大批人马，不久前，由于“功勋卓著”，该处在波恩不惜巨资新建一座高层大楼。当地人都习惯称之为“宣传部”，因为人们对当年戈培尔掌管希特勒的“宣传部”时的作为还记忆犹新。这次外长会议召开，埃卡特奉命率领所属大小头目赴日内瓦。说来也许有人不信，埃卡特及其部下竟占西德代表团总人数的一半。这也就是在日内瓦产生“埃卡特一帮人”之称的由来。
    在日内瓦的大街小巷、在各国代表团的记者招待会上、在国联大厦以及新闻中心，“埃卡特一帮人”到处可见。他们朝夕奔走各处，任务是：搜集情况、研究气候、散布有特定目的的流言蜚语。对于各种不同的记者，专门备有“引人兴味的消息”。不过，活动方式虽然花样繁多，但都遵循一条“阿登纳路线”：尽力诽谤苏联和德意志民主共和国在外长会议上的主张和立场，散布会议出现“危机”、“走入死胡同”、“已经垮台”等一类谣言。
    在每次西德代表团的官方记者招待会上，埃卡特先生总是要露脸讲几句话的。但是，他的主要活动场所却在另一种“幕后记者招待会”上。这种幕后招待会几乎每天在他的别墅举行，只有经过仔细挑选的西德记者方能入内。在这个会上，埃卡特不仅发布一般指示，而且规定新闻的内容和明天报纸的标题。例如前几天外长们正在集中讨论西柏林问题，甚至西方阵线中也有某些人士，一度不得不承认西柏林的局势不正常，埃卡特深怕西方守不住阵线，就马上通过“幕后记者招待会”动作起来，第二天的西德报纸上就出现了刺目的大标题：如“西方国家在日内瓦立场强硬”，“葛罗米柯的不妥协立场促使西方采取强硬方针”等等。不仅如此，西德通讯社还急忙传出如下消息：美国国务卿赫脱已“失去耐性”并定6月6日回国。但是美国代表团到现在还没离开日内瓦。
    埃卡特是以阻挠举行最高级会议为己任的。于是西德报纸就奉命引用“可靠消息”，断言最高级会议的主意已经被埋葬。埃卡特先生还首创了召开“最低级会议”的妙论。“埃卡特一帮人”在日内瓦宣称：外长会议后，召开外交部长助理级会议是适时之举，而如果召开大使级会议，则更是现实的产物。
    使埃卡特伤脑筋的，是德意志民主共和国的三色国旗在博尔茨外长的汽车上飘扬。前不久，德意志民主共和国代表团成员、国防部第一副部长霍夫曼在日内瓦举行了记者招待会，把西德代表团和
  “埃卡特一帮人”散布的“德意志民主共和国军国主义化”的谎言驳得体无完肤。埃卡特十分恼火，但又无力反驳，于是使出了“借刀杀人”之计。过了几天，瑞士某些报纸出现了对德意志民主共和国的诽谤之音。“日内瓦日报”甚至发表了题为“令人不快的人”的文章，对博尔茨外长同其他外长坐在一起表示恼怒，并进行无礼攻击；另一方面，日内瓦“记者之家”管理处也出面了，专门写了一封信给德意志民主共和国代表团，诬蔑德意志民主共和国“滥用”“记者之家”的规则，在那里“胡搞”等等。不过，埃卡特先生由于情急之故，手法过于拙劣，用“记者之家”名义写给德意志民主共和国的信，甚至还没有等到对方答复，就已经当众散发了，连无见识之士也识破了其中奥妙。在此之后，关于埃卡特的谈论中，又增加了新的笑料。
    最近，阿登纳决定留任总理。埃卡特特地回国晋见，并在回到日内瓦时说，目前他“有些悲观”。本来，谁接受了阿登纳的指示而对外长会议感到“乐观”，这将是奇迹。俗话说：物以类聚。埃卡特之所以成为西方破坏外长会议的急先锋阿登纳之心腹，当然不是偶然的。（附图片）
