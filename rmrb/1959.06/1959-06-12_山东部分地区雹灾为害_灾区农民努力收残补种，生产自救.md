Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 11th – On June 7th, hailstorms struck parts of Shandong Province. Including the two slight hailstorms on May 26th and 28th, a total of thirty-three counties and cities in the province were affected by hailstorms, with over one million mu of farmland affected. Wheat and spring crops suffered varying degrees of damage. In parts of the four counties of Wenshang, Qufu, Feicheng, and Ningyang, which were severely affected, not only were most of the wheat grains knocked off, but also most of the spring crops were destroyed.

After the hailstorms, Party and government leaders at all levels promptly went to express their condolences and organize rescue efforts. The CPC Jining Prefectural Committee organized six condolence groups with more than 500 people to visit six affected counties. The Wenshang County Committee also organized a 300-person condolence group, bringing 15,000 yuan in relief funds to various disaster areas. On the 9th, the CPC Shandong Provincial Committee convened a disaster relief meeting attended by responsible persons from relevant departments, deciding that in areas severely affected by hailstorms, production for disaster relief should be the immediate focus. Based on the specific situation, arrangements should be made for the lives of the masses, and summer production should be vigorously pursued. The meeting urged all localities to seize the time and vigorously organize the harvesting of remaining crops, as well as the replanting and supplementary planting of various crops. It also called for assisting each production team in formulating plans for production-based disaster relief and overcoming the summer food shortage, so that they have the means and confidence to overcome the disaster and strive for a bumper harvest in the autumn. The meeting demanded that disaster areas effectively arrange for the lives of the masses. The Provincial Committee decided to allocate one jin of food per person per day in the disaster areas before the autumn harvest. At the same time, it mobilized the masses to increase the planting of melons, vegetables, and early-maturing crops, and to conserve food to overcome the summer food shortage.

After receiving condolences and strong support from Party and government leading organs at all levels, the morale of farmers in the disaster areas gradually stabilized. Many communes and production teams put forward the slogan "Harvest every grain possible, pick up every grain possible," actively harvesting remaining wheat and rushing to plant and replant various crops. Communes and production teams in areas not affected by the disaster promoted the spirit of mutual assistance and actively supported seeds to help disaster areas engage in production for self-salvation. Some areas also assisted disaster-stricken communes and teams in repairing damaged houses.

    山东部分地区雹灾为害
    灾区农民努力收残补种，生产自救
    据新华社济南11日电　6月7日，山东部分地区发生雹灾。连同5月26日、28日两次轻微的雹灾，全省共有三十三个县市的部分地区受到雹灾侵袭，受灾农田面积达一百万亩以上。小麦、春苗受到不同程度的损失，受灾严重的汶上、曲阜、肥城、宁阳四个县的部分地区，不仅麦粒大部打落，春苗也大部被砸毁。
    雹灾发生后，各地党政负责同志都及时前往慰问、抢救。中共济宁地委组织了有五百多人参加的六个慰问团，赴六个受灾县慰问；汶上县委也组织三百人的慰问团，带救济款一万五千元，到各受灾地区慰问。9日，中共山东省委召开了有关部门负责人参加的救灾会议，决定在雹灾严重的地区，立即以生产救灾为中心，从具体情况出发，安排好群众生活，抓好夏季生产。会议要求各地抓紧时机，大力组织抢收、抢种、补种。并帮助每一个生产队订出生产救灾、度过夏荒的计划，使他们有办法、有信心战胜灾荒，争取秋季丰收。会议要求受灾地区切实安排好群众生活，省委决定受灾地区在秋收前每天每人安排一斤口粮，同时发动群众增种瓜菜和早熟作物，节约用粮度过夏荒。
    灾区农民经过各地党政领导机关的慰问和大力支持，情绪逐步安定下来，不少公社和生产队提出了“多收一颗是一颗，多拾一粒是一粒”的口号，积极收获残麦和抢种、补种各种作物。未受灾地区的公社和生产队，发扬了互助友爱的精神，积极支援种子，帮助受灾地区生产自救。有些地区还协助受灾社、队修补被打毁的房屋。
