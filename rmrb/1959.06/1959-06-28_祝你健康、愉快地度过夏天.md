Wishing You a Healthy and Happy Summer
    Supplement Editor

    June 22nd, the 17th day of the fifth lunar month, is the Summer Solstice.

    Although our country has vast territory, with climates varying from cold to hot from north to south, and the arrival of seasons varies in timing, when the Summer Solstice arrives, it is always summer.

    Bright and energetic summer brings enormous light and heat to the world, enabling all things to grow vigorously, mature, and reproduce. Wherever summer arrives, it is filled with vitality: the tender branches of spring become lush shade, the oily green wheat seedlings become golden waves of wheat; rapeseed is harvested, corn grows taller... Who can imagine that without the light and heat of nature, there would be life!

    The summer climate is hot. We struggle with nature, and in summer we must also struggle with the climate. However, people are, after all, the masters of nature. In our socialist country, we have increasingly developed favorable conditions for controlling nature, and we have conscious labor filled with revolutionary zeal. No matter how fierce and powerful nature is, when it comes before the revolutionary people, it has to bow its head and submit, obediently listening to our commands. When we see the people of Guangdong fighting and triumphing over the worst flood in a century, how can we not be even more full of energy in the face of the summer climate?

    Our people know how to harness the summer, not only to adapt ourselves to the summer, but also to use the summer to exert a good influence on our production and life.

    The purpose of compiling this special page today is to contribute a small effort to help our dear readers spend a healthy and happy summer.

    We hope that everyone will pay more attention to hygiene and prevent disease. Summer is a rather busy season for our industrial and agricultural production, especially the summer harvest and summer planting, with a lot of work to do. It would be bad if we get sick. As the saying goes, even a hero fears illness. The cause of these diseases is often due to one's own carelessness, an accidental oversight, which results in losses in production and work. Do you think it is worth it?

    We also hope that everyone will increase their cultural and recreational life. The climate is hot, which easily makes people sleepy and tired. What should we do? If you have time, go swimming, take a walk, or see a late-night movie, visit an exhibition. In the shade, read a good book; in the sound of cicadas, play a game of chess. In the evening, after work, hold a small evening gathering in the yard. Elders tell stories of struggles in the past, children sing new songs, recognize the stars in the sky, and everyone talks about the new people and new things in the commune or neighborhood. This is truly: a fine time, a beautiful day, and a warm sun, pleasing sights and happy events in every family's courtyard.

    Wishing you a healthy and happy summer. Work well, study well, rest well, and have fun!

    祝你健康、愉快地度过夏天
    副刊编者
    6月22日，旧历五月十七，是夏至节。
    尽管我国疆土辽阔，从北到南，气候有冷有热，季节的到来有迟有早，但是到了夏至，却总是夏天了。
    明朗而富于热力的夏天，给人间带来巨大的光和热，使万物茁壮生长，成熟繁衍。夏天到了哪里，哪里就充满了生命的活力：春天的嫩枝变成了浓郁的丛荫，油绿的麦苗变成了金黄的麦浪；油菜收割了，玉米长高了……谁能想像，如果没有这大自然的光和热，又怎能有生命！
    夏天气候炎热。我们同大自然作斗争，在夏季还得加上同气候作斗争。但是，人，毕竟是大自然的主人。在我们社会主义国家里，有着日益发展的控制自然的有利条件，有着自觉的充满了革命干劲的劳动。不管大自然怎么凶猛，怎么厉害，来到革命的人民面前，它也只好低头服输，乖乖地听人使唤。当我们看到广东人民正在同百年特大的洪水搏斗取得胜利的时候，我们在夏天的气候面前怎能不更加充满干劲？
    我们的人民是懂得如何去驾驭夏天的，不仅使我们自己能适应夏天，而且要利用夏天对我们的生产、生活发挥好的作用。
    我们今天编这么一个专页，目的也就是尽一分微力，帮助亲爱的读者们健康、愉快地度过夏天。
    我们希望大家更加注意卫生，预防疾病。夏季是我们工农业生产相当紧张的季节，特别是夏收夏种，活儿多得很。如果生了病，那就不好了。常言道：英雄只怕病来磨。而这些疾病的起因，常是由于自己的不小心，偶然的疏忽，结果却造成生产上、工作上的损失，你说值得不值得？
    我们也希望大家增加一些文化娱乐生活。气候热，容易困人，容易疲乏，怎么办？有空就去游游水、散散步吧，或者看一个夜场电场，参观一个展览会。浓荫之下，读一本好书；蝉噪声中，下一盘棋。晚上，工余之暇，院子里举行一个小型晚叙会。长辈们讲讲当年斗争故事，孩子们唱唱新歌，认认天上的星星，大家谈谈公社或者街道上的新人新事，这真是：良辰美景艳阳天，赏心乐事家家院。
    祝你健康、愉快地度过这个炎炎的长夏。劳动得好，学习得好，休息得好，娱乐得好！
