    A Poem of Anger
    朝鲜　Li Hao-ri
    There, the sun has lost its light,
    And the lush flowers have withered and yellowed.
    On the dark land of South Korea,
    Like a volcanic eruption, uneasily surging.
    Everywhere are the roars of kind people,
    Calling on the entire people to welcome the battle!
    The roar scolds the inhuman American wolves,
    Denouncing Syngman Rhee's reactionary schemes.
    Rolling thick smoke obscures the sea,
    American pirates bring ships to transport "slaves."
    Arise, smash their treacherous plans,
    Don't allow this cannibalistic trade on our land!
    High mountains stand tall and majestic,
    The sea rises with angry tides and waves,
    Dear compatriots, South Korean brothers!
    Who dares to transport you to distant foreign lands!
    There, a cruel whip is wielded,
    Plunder makes your families ruined,
    Hunger and death are not even worth mentioning,
    The colonizers' farms will become graveyards!
    Who can force you with guns and swords?
    The sweet words of "immigration" are also in vain.
    People stand up facing the North Star,
    Striving forward to break free from the fate of drifting in foreign lands.
    Everything yearned for seems to be right before our eyes;
    Yearning for a free and happy tomorrow,
    Molten iron flowing, flowers blooming,
    The water of life irrigating the fertile fields passed down by our ancestors!
    Thinking of all this, people feel happy,
    Thinking of the new bridge over the Daedong River.
    Thinking of the northern brothers marching towards socialism,
    Bury the declaration of the Republic government in your hearts.
    I, a poet who sings for tens of millions of Koreans,
    Dedicate to you, southern brothers, a passionate poem,
    May it appeal to the hearts of kind people,
    May it fly to the south sky filled with dark clouds.
    Wolves with wild ambitions, Korea is not yours!
    South Korea is not your homeland!
    Everything here is not allowed to be trampled by you,
    Get out, retract your hairy claws,
    Your bloody gun muzzles!
    Don't forget the lesson of six years ago,
    The passengers of the "slave ships" are yourselves!
    The waves of the sea will engulf the pirates,
    We will use this ship to send you back home!
    Let us turn into cannons and lightning,
    Burning with raging anger,
    Push the brutal wolves with wild ambitions into the deep sea,
    Drive these slave buyers out of the earth!

    愤怒的诗
    朝鲜　李浩日在那里，太阳失去了光芒，茂盛的花儿也萎谢枯黄。南朝鲜的漆黑的土地上，像火山爆发，不安地动荡。到处是善良人们的怒吼，召唤全民去迎接战斗！吼声怒斥丧失人性的美国狼，声讨李承晚反动的阴谋。滚滚浓烟蒙蔽了海面，美国海盗开来舰只运“奴隶”。起来，粉碎他们的奸计，不准在我们的国土上干这人吃
  人的交易！高山峻岭巍然屹立，大海腾起怒潮激浪，亲爱的同胞，南朝鲜弟兄们！谁敢把你们运往遥远的异乡！那儿挥动着残酷的皮鞭，掠夺使你们家破人亡，饥饿和死亡更不用提起，殖民者的农场将成为墓场！谁能用枪剑强迫你们？
  “移民”的花言巧语也是枉然。人们朝着北极星站起来，为摆脱飘零异域的命运奋斗向
  前。向往着的一切仿佛就在眼前；向往着自由幸福的明天，铁水长流，鲜花盛开，生命的水流灌溉祖先传下的
  肥沃田原！想起这一切，人们心情舒畅，想着那大同江上新的桥梁。想着走向社会主义的北部弟兄把共和国政府的声明在心底埋
  藏。我，为着千万个朝鲜人而歌的
  诗人，献给你南部弟兄激情的诗篇，愿它能呼吁善良人们的心灵，愿它飞向乌云弥漫的南天。野心狼，朝鲜不是你们的！南朝鲜不是你们的故土！这里的一切都不容你们践踏，滚蛋，缩回你毛茸茸的手爪，
  血淋淋的枪口！不要忘记六年前的教训，“奴隶舰”乘客是你们自己！大海的波涛将要吞没海盗，我们要用这只船送你们回老
  家！让我们变成炮弹和闪电燃烧起熊熊的怒火，把残暴的野心狼推下深海，把这些奴隶的买主赶出地球！
