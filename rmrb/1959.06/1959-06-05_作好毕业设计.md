    Do a Good Job on Graduation Design
    Bin Nan
    The current graduating students of higher industrial schools have begun their graduation design projects. This is the final step in the teaching process of higher industrial schools and, to a certain extent, a summary of students' learning in school. Through graduation design work, students will comprehensively apply the basic theories and industrial technology professional knowledge they have learned in the past few years to study and solve problems existing in actual production, so that they can be trained and possess a certain degree of independent working ability. Doing a good job in graduation design is of considerable importance for improving the quality of cadres and for inspecting, summarizing, and improving teaching work.
    This year, the graduation designs of students in higher industrial schools are closely linked to production practice, abandoning the style of "armchair strategists." The design topics all come from production, and the results of the design research will also return to production to serve production. The problems and factors considered in production practice are often much more complex than those in textbooks, which can deepen students' learning and train their independent working ability. Further linking theory with the reality of national construction can enhance students' sense of responsibility and further improve their graduation design.
    However, we must also recognize that production labor cannot replace theoretical teaching; one aspect of production training cannot replace the requirements of other aspects. Carrying out graduation design with real swords and guns, if you do not pay attention to completing the teaching requirements, it may not achieve the goal of comprehensive training. Some people think that students' abilities in certain areas have already been trained in the past, and comprehensive training has been completed separately in the past, so the current graduation design does not need to start from strengthening comprehensive and comprehensive training. This will lower the requirements for graduation design. It should be seen that the past training is different from today's comprehensive and comprehensive training in graduation design. Students should further improve on the basis of existing training, and achieve the goal of comprehensive improvement through graduation design. Schools should pay attention to further combining teaching, production labor, and scientific research in different types of graduation design, so that students can receive better comprehensive training.
    Students should pay attention to overcoming certain "small calculations" of individualism in graduation design. Because wrong ideas can only lead people to the wrong path. Especially when combining with production for graduation design, if it is not done well and errors occur, it will directly affect production and construction. Students who have undergone ideological reform naturally want to report their best graduation design results to the motherland as an answer to the country and the people for their years of cultivation, and naturally want to dedicate their sincere hearts to the country and the people. We hope to hear their heartbeats of serving the people and see their true talents and practical skills in tens of thousands of graduation designs.
    Teachers should play a better leading role in graduation design. The success of students' graduation design also shows that the teacher's hard work has blossomed and borne fruit. If the past teaching work has been done well, then we must continue to work hard; if the past has not been done enough, then we must strive to make up for it. After the student completes the graduation design, the entire school study life ends. May the graduation design, under the guidance of teachers and the efforts of students, make due contributions to the motherland and the people, and become the most precious crystallization of mutual teaching and growth between teachers and students.

    作好毕业设计
    彬南
    高等工业学校本届毕业学生已开始作毕业设计了，这是高等工业学校教学过程中最后一个环节，在一定程度上它也是学生在校学习的一次总结。通过毕业设计工作，学生将全面地综合运用过去几年所学的基础理论与工业技术专业知识，来研究和解决实际生产中存在的问题，使自己得到锻炼，具备一定的独立工作能力。做好毕业设计工作，对于提高干部的质量，检查、总结和提高教学工作也有相当重要的意义。
    今年高等工业学校学生的毕业设计都同生产实践有紧密联系，抛掉了“纸上谈兵”风气。设计题目都来自生产，设计的研究的结果也将回到生产，为生产服务。生产实践中所发生的问题和考虑的因素，往往要比书本上复杂得多，可以使学生加深学习的深度，锻炼独立工作能力。理论进一步联系了国家建设的实际，可以增强学生的责任感，进一步做好毕业设计。
    但是，我们也必须认识，生产劳动并不能代替理论教学；一个方面的生产训练，更不能代替其他方面的要求。真刀真枪地进行毕业设计，如果不注意完成教学要求，也有可能达不到全面培养的目的。有人认为，学生的某方面的能力已经在过去训练过了，全面训练已经在过去分别完成，现在的毕业设计不必从加强全面的综合锻炼出发。这样就会降低对毕业设计的要求。应该看到，过去的训练同今天毕业设计的全面而综合的训练是有区别的。学生要在已有训练的基础上，经过毕业设计，进一步提高，达到全面提高的目的。学校要注意在不同类型的毕业设计中，进一步把教学、生产劳动、科学研究互相结合，使学生受到更好的全面训练。
    学生在毕业设计中，要注意克服个人主义的某些“小打算”。因为，错误的思想，只能把人们引导到错误的道路上去。特别是结合生产作毕业设计，如果做不好，发生错误，那就会直接影响生产建设。经过思想改造的学生们，自然都愿意把自己最好的毕业设计成绩向祖国汇报，作为对国家和人民多年培养的回答，自然也会愿意把自己的一颗赤心献给国家和人民。我们希望能在多少万篇毕业设计中，听到他们为人民服务的跳动着的心声，看到他们真才实学的本领。
    教师在毕业设计中，要更好地发挥主导作用。学生毕业设计的成功，也说明教师的心血灌溉开了花，结了果。如果过去教学工作做得很好，那就要再接再励；如果过去做得不够，那就要努力补足。学生做完毕业设计，全部学校学习生活就结束了。愿在教师的指导下，在学生的努力下，使毕业设计对祖国对人民作出应有的贡献，并且成为师生之间教学相长的最珍贵的结晶。
