Xinhua News Agency, Zedang, June 22nd (by our reporter Lin Tian): Early summer has arrived in the Shannan region of the Tibetan Plateau, a place of beautiful scenery. Rapeseed flowers are blooming along the Yarlung Zangbo River, and highland barley in the Himalayan valleys has begun to sprout ears. Several hundred thousand mu of crops throughout the region are growing well. More than one hundred thousand Tibetan laborers here are happily welcoming this summer of peace, freedom, and vitality.

The Shannan region was once a nest of Tibetan rebel bandits. In the early summer of last year, the bandits began to gather here, robbing grain, requisitioning labor, slaughtering cattle and sheep, and raping women, turning the area into a desolate, ruined land, a living hell. After the rebellion was quelled, under the leadership of the Shannan Sub-Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Shannan Military Control Commission, the people rapidly rebuilt their homes and resumed production, bringing about a thriving new atmosphere here.

In Naidong County, historically a cultural center of Tibet, much of the fertile land belonged to the manors of big serf owners like Soekang Wangqing Geler and Kaimo Sonam Wangdui, heads of the rebel bandits. After the rebellion was quelled, the Military Control Commission announced that this year's policy for these bandit leaders' land would be "whoever cultivates it, harvests it." The serfs were overjoyed, and their enthusiasm for production soared. The highland barley, peas, and flax they planted are growing very well. Those Tibetan men and women who for generations had engaged in unpaid labor on the estate owners' self-operated land spontaneously organized mutual aid production teams to jointly manage these fields, going out early and returning late, weeding and watering on time. This is the first time in many years that they have worked for themselves, and they describe today's ease and joy as being like "taking off a raw hide hat" (wearing a raw hide hat was a form of torture used by Tibetan serf owners; when a wet raw hide hat was put on, it would shrink as it dried, causing headaches and dizziness). In a field that belonged to a rebellious big serf owner, three girls were weeding and chatting happily. They are three sisters. The eldest sister, Cangjue, told the reporter that the harvest from this plot of land this year would belong to her family, so they were working harder and harder. She said that the rebel bandits had torn down her family's house to use as firewood. After the rebellion was quelled, more than a dozen soldiers of the People's Liberation Army worked for three full days to help her family repair the house, and the Military Control Commission lent her family thirty ke (each ke is twenty-five jin) of highland barley as seeds and food. Now the three sisters are so happy that they often sing and dance in the evenings. They also demand that the "Ula" (corvée labor) and usury be abolished.

In the woods near the ancient city of Zedang in Shannan, people are now weaving pulu again. The reporter met a Tibetan named Awang who was weaving pulu. He had been weaving for others for thirty-one years, since he was fifteen years old. When the rebel bandits occupied Zedang, they conscripted him to a distant place. Later, he pretended to be deaf and dumb and escaped, but all the clothes and belongings he had accumulated over thirty-one years, except for an earring hidden in the rafters, were looted by the rebel bandits, and his wife also ran out of food at home. Only after the rebellion was quelled did he resume weaving pulu.

The Yarlung Zangbo River yak-hide boat ferry has been particularly busy recently. The exchange of goods, which had been interrupted for a year, has begun to resume. Suolang and his wife, from Qiongjiezong, were driving four donkeys, loaded with earthenware pottery, waiting to cross the river. Suolang said that the people there grow crops and make earthenware pottery at the same time. The income from the land was all taken away by the serf owners, and they relied solely on pottery to exchange for salt and grain. Before the rebellion was quelled, they were afraid of being robbed by the rebel bandits and dared not go out, and the whole family lacked grain and salt. This is the first time in ten months that they have taken pottery to the north bank of the river to exchange for grain and salt.

In the two months since the rebellion was quelled, the Shannan Sub-Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Shannan Military Control Commission have been making every effort to help the Tibetan people, who have suffered so many disasters, build a new life. During the spring plowing season, the leading organs ordered all agencies and troops in the Shannan region to be responsible for helping the Tibetan people with spring plowing on a contract basis, and no land was allowed to be left uncultivated. If the Tibetan people did not have seeds, they were given seeds; if they lacked manpower, they were provided with manpower; if they lacked draft animals, military horses were lent out. After all the land was sown, methods such as work-for-relief, relief, and low-priced supply of daily necessities were used to help the people through the spring and summer famine. According to incomplete statistics, the total amount of grain supplied to poor Tibetans in various ways throughout the region has reached more than 300,000 jin, more than 70,000 bricks of tea, and a large amount of salt and butter. After basically eliminating the remnants of the bandits, the staff and troops were dispersed to various rural areas to eat with the poor Tibetan people (bringing their own food and eating with the Tibetans), live with them (living in the vacant houses and sheds of the Tibetans, and some even living next to the cattle sheds), and work with them. While helping the people restore production, they visited the poor to ask about their suffering, and mobilized the masses to welcome democratic reforms.

    雅鲁藏布江沿岸菜花开　喜马拉雅山谷青稞抽穗
    山南地区气象一新
    据新华社泽当22日电　本社记者林田报道：初夏来到了西藏高原风光美丽的山南地区。雅鲁藏布江沿岸油菜花开，喜马拉雅山谷里的青稞已开始抽穗，全区几十万亩庄稼都长得很好。这里的十多万藏族劳动人民，正在愉快地迎接着这个和平、自由和活跃的夏天。
    山南地区一度是西藏叛匪的巢穴，去年初夏，叛匪开始在这里集结，匪徒们抢粮支差、杀牛捉羊、强奸妇女，弄得这里田地荒芜、村落残破，成了人间的地狱。叛乱平息以后，人民在中共山南分工委和山南军管会的领导下，迅速重建家园、恢复生产，使这里出现了一片欣欣向荣的新气象。
    在历史上一度是西藏文化中心的乃东县，许多肥沃的土地，都是叛匪头子索康·旺清格勒、凯墨·索南旺堆等大农奴主的庄园。叛乱平息以后，军管会宣布这些匪首的土地今年实行谁种谁收的政策，农奴们人心大快，生产热情极为高涨，他们种的青稞、豌豆、亚麻长得很好。那些世代在庄园主的自营地上从事无偿劳役的男女藏胞，自动组织起了生产互助组，共同管理这些田地，每天早出晚归，按时拔草放水。这是他们多少年来第一次为自己劳动，他们形容今天的轻松愉快，就像“摘掉了生牛皮帽子”（戴生牛皮帽子是西藏农奴主的一种酷刑，戴上湿的生牛皮帽子后，越干越紧，箍得头晕眼胀）一样。在一个叛乱大农奴主的田地里，有三个姑娘在有说有笑地拔草。她们是三姊妹。大姐苍觉对记者说，这块地今年的收获要归她家所有了，因此她们干起活来越干越起劲。她说，叛匪曾经拆掉她家的房子当柴烧。平叛以后，十几个解放军整整干了三天，帮助她家把房子修好，军管会又借给他家三十克（每克二十五斤）青稞作种子和口粮。现在三姊妹快活得常常在晚上唱歌跳舞。她们还要求明令废除“乌拉”（差役），废除高利贷。
    在山南古城泽当附近的树林里，现在又有人在织氆氇了。记者遇到一个织氆氇的藏民阿旺，他从十五岁起，给人织了三十一年。叛匪盘据泽当时，把他拉夫带到远处，后来他装聋装傻逃了回来，但是他三十一年间积下的一点衣物，除了藏在房梁上的一只耳环外，全被叛匪抢光了，妻子也在家断了粮。平叛以后，他才恢复织氆氇。
    雅鲁藏布江牛皮船渡口上，最近显得特别繁忙。中断了一年的物资交流开始恢复。从琼洁宗来的索郎夫妇两人，赶着四头毛驴，满载着土制陶器，正在等待摆渡。索郎说，他们那里的人种地兼作土陶器，土地收入全被农奴主拿走了，只靠陶器换盐换粮。叛乱未平息前，他们怕叛匪抢掠，不敢出门，全家缺粮无盐。这是他们十个月来第一次拿陶器到江北去换粮食和盐。
    叛乱平息后的两个多月来，中共山南分工委和山南军管会，用全力帮助这里受尽重重灾难的藏族人民建设新的生活。春耕期间，领导机关曾下令山南地区的各机关、部队分片包干帮助藏民春耕，不准让一块土地荒废。藏族人民没有种子就发放种子，缺人力就出人力，没耕畜就借出军马。土地全部下种以后，又用以工代赈和救济、廉价供应生活用品等办法，帮助人民度过春、夏荒。据不完全统计，全区以各种方式供应贫苦藏民的粮食已有三十多万斤，茶叶七万多块，还有大量盐巴和酥油。工作人员和部队，在基本肃清残匪以后，都分散到各个农村，和贫苦的藏族人民同吃（带着自己的一份伙食，和藏民一起吃饭）、同住（住在藏民的空房和草棚里，有的就住在牛棚旁）、同劳动，一面帮助人民恢复生产，一面访贫问苦，发动群众迎接民主改革。
