Xinhua News Agency report: Hefei City's secondary schools in Anhui Province are actively taking measures to rectify labor projects and establish labor bases while focusing on teaching, and properly arrange teaching and productive labor.

Since last year, Hefei City's secondary schools have established a large number of factories and farms, initially establishing fixed labor bases, and including productive labor in the teaching plan. After the start of this semester, under the leadership of the Hefei Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, each school, according to the number of laborers and the needs of teaching, and adhering to the principle of "mainly within the school, mainly industrial and agricultural labor, mainly collective labor," actively rectified the production labor projects and bases, establishing labor bases with industry as the main focus in urban schools and agriculture as the main focus in suburban schools.

The rectification of labor production projects and bases in each school is carried out under the premise of focusing on teaching. The arrangement of production projects takes into account the physical strength of the students and is combined with teaching as much as possible. For example, Hefei No. 1 Middle School organizes high school students to participate in the production labor of machinery factories, in order to combine it with high school mathematics, physics, and chemistry teaching; most of the junior high school students are assigned to engage in agricultural and sideline production, which not only suits the physical strength of the students, but also can be combined with zoology and botany teaching.

While rectifying labor projects and bases, each school made proper arrangements for production labor time. In order to strengthen the leadership and management of school production labor, the Municipal Education Bureau established a production office, and each school established production management committees and other organizations. In order to organically combine teaching and productive labor, some school teaching and research group leaders participate in the leadership of production projects related to their own courses, such as the biology teaching and research group leader participating in the leadership of agricultural and sideline production, and the physics teaching and research group leader participating in the leadership of machinery factories, etc. In this way, teachers not only strengthen the combination of theory and practice, enrich teaching content, and improve teaching quality, but also provide technical guidance to students in conjunction with book theory.

    适应学生体力　结合教学内容
    合肥中等学校整顿劳动项目
    据新华社讯　安徽合肥市各中等学校在以教学为中心的前提下，积极采取措施整顿劳动项目，建立劳动基地，妥善安排教学与生产劳动。
    去年以来，合肥市各中等学校办起大批的工厂和农场，初步建立了固定的劳动基地，生产劳动列入了教学计划。这学期开学以后，在中共合肥市委领导下，各学校根据劳动的人数和教学的需要，本着“校内为主、工农业劳动为主、集体劳动为主”的原则，对生产劳动项目和基地积极进行了整顿，在市区学校以工业为主，郊区学校以农业为主，分别建立劳动基地。
    各校整顿劳动生产项目和基地，都是在以教学为中心的前提下进行的。对生产项目的安排，都注意适应学生的体力，并尽可能和教学相结合。如合肥一中组织高中学生参加机械厂的生产劳动，以便于和高中的数理化教学结合起来；初中学生大部分分配搞农副业生产，既适应学生体力，又可结合动植物课教学。
    在整顿劳动项目和基地的同时，各校对生产劳动时间作了妥善安排。为了加强学校生产劳动的领导和管理，市教育局成立了生产办公室，各校成立了生产管理委员会等组织。为了使教学和生产劳动有机地结合起来，有些学校教研组的组长参加与自己这一门课有关的生产项目的领导工作，如生物教研组长参加农副业生产领导工作；物理教研组长参加机械厂的领导等。这样，教师们一方面加强理论和实践的结合，丰富教学内容，提高教学质量，另一方面也结合书本理论，对学生进行了技术指导。
