Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, June 23rd: Hubei Province has taken emergency measures along the Yangtze River, Han River, and at many large reservoir construction sites, organizing massive forces to prepare for the summer floods.

Currently, people's communes in counties along the Yangtze and Han Rivers have universally established flood control headquarters, with leading Party and government cadres serving as commanders. Flood control materials and equipment collected from various locations are also being continuously transported to flood control construction sites. Jingzhou Prefecture, spanning both sides of the Yangtze and Han Rivers, has formed a flood control team of more than 60,000 people, ready to depart, to ensure a good harvest in the Jianghan Plain. In addition, more than 1,600 elite vanguard squads (groups) with rich flood control and rescue experience have been organized to be responsible for crucial tasks such as patrolling embankments, investigating risks, communication and liaison, underwater operations, and emergency rescue. On the Han River, known for its "violent temperament," the 420-kilometer-long dike has been thoroughly surveyed, and various safety measures have been immediately taken after inspecting dangerous sections. Currently, along the Han River, a crash program is underway to complete more than 200,000 cubic meters of reinforcement and heightening projects to ensure the safety of the dikes everywhere.

The Yangtze River's main dike has been continuously repaired and reinforced over the years since the great flood of 1954, and the dike is already quite solid. However, prefectures, counties, and people's communes along the route are still taking measures to strengthen pre-flood preparations in the spirit of raising vigilance and opposing complacency. Jiangling County, at the foot of the Jingjiang Dike, recently dispatched 3,000 laborers to complete the reinforcement project of the Jingjiang Dike in a concentrated effort. Based on years of flood control experience, the county has formed three batches of flood control teams, first, second, and third lines, which can closely combine flood control with agricultural production and cooperate with each other.

In addition to the Yangtze and Han Rivers, leadership has also been strengthened for flood control work on civilian dikes and large reservoir dams, and unified arrangements have been made. In addition to dispatching more than 12,000 people to reinforce the dangerous sections of the river dikes, Xiaogan Prefecture also sent 10,000 civilian workers to complete 21 reservoir dams under construction before the major flood season in a concentrated effort.

According to Southern Daily news, Zhongshan, Fanshun, Nanhai, and other counties in the Pearl River Delta are seizing the time to organize more than 148,000 people to rush to harvest summer grain while continuing to strengthen flood control preparations. In two days, more than 114,000 mu were harvested.

In addition to dispatching more than 100,000 people to carry out flood control and rescue work to ensure the safety of the dikes, Zhongshan County also dispatched more than 60,000 people to participate in rushing to harvest. In order to guard against extraordinarily large floods, all communes are seizing every precious moment to organize rushing to harvest. The harvesting team of Gangkou Commune has increased from more than 4,300 people to more than 6,800 people. The commune Party committee also organized 180 cadres from government offices, employees, and residents to assist in rushing to harvest in various production teams. The commune's transportation team also dispatched large and small boats to assist in transportation. The supply and marketing departments also prepared charcoal stoves and charcoal to support various production teams in processing wet grain. The county has rushed to harvest more than 41,000 mu of early rice in two days. Under the principle of equivalent exchange, many communes organize labor and tool cooperation between teams, with areas with lighter harvesting tasks supporting areas with heavy tasks, greatly accelerating the harvesting speed.

In Panyu area of Fanshun County, after the rainstorm, the Party secretaries of various communes and the cadres of various large teams went deep into the teams and adopted the method of grasping flood control on the one hand and rushing to harvest on the other, carrying out the two tasks simultaneously. In rushing to harvest, according to each person's strengths, specialized teams for quick harvesting, quick threshing, flipping and threshing, and grain inspection were organized, and joint acceptance teams were formed to implement professional division of labor, with everyone being specifically responsible to the end. Daily evaluations and acceptances were carried out, threshing while harvesting, and transporting and storing while harvesting, thus rapidly setting off a high tide of rushing to harvest carefully. In order to seize grain from the flood, various places have come up with many ways to improve harvesting efficiency.

While rushing to harvest, all counties have actively taken effective measures to prevent grain from sprouting and avoid grain loss. Some communes manage the harvested rice by households, with commune members responsible for threshing and drying; some use grain dryers or grain drying yards and grain drying stoves to dry grain; some communes make full use of houses and brickyards to spread the grain thinly and turn it frequently; and some use boiling water to scald the grain and salt water to mix the grain. These methods have all achieved good results.

    湖北人民采取紧急措施
    准备迎击夏季洪水
    珠江三角洲农民边防洪边抢收
    新华社武汉23日电　湖北省对长江、汉江沿线和许多大型水库工地，采取紧急措施，组织千军万马，准备迎战夏季洪水。
    目前，长江、汉江沿岸各县人民公社普遍建立防汛指挥部，由党政负责干部担任指挥。各地筹集的防汛物资器材，也正源源运往防汛工地。横跨长江、汉江两岸的荆州专区，为确保江汉平原的农业丰收，已经组成一支有六万多人参加的防汛队伍，待命出发。另外还组织一千六百多个富有防汛抢险经验的尖兵班（组），负责巡堤查险、通讯联络、潜水作业和突击抢险等紧要任务。在一向“性情暴躁”的汉江，四百二十公里长的堤防已经经过普查，险要工段在检查后当即采取了各种安全措施。目前汉江沿线正在进一步突击完成二十多万土方的加固加高工程，以保证堤坝处处安全。
    长江干堤自1954年大水之后，经过历年不断地修补加固，堤防已相当坚固。但沿线各专区、县和人民公社仍本着提高警惕、反对麻痹思想的精神，采取措施加强汛前准备。荆江大堤脚下的江陵县，不久前曾抽调三千劳动力，突击完成了荆江大堤的加固工程。根据历年防汛经验，这个县分别组成一、二、三线的三批防汛队伍，就可以使防汛与农业生产密切结合，互相协作。
    除了长江、汉江以外，各地对民堤民垸和大型水库大坝的防汛工作也加强了领导，统一作了安排。孝感专区除了抽调一万二千多人抢修江堤险工以外，又派一万民工，抢在大汛以前，突击完成二十一座正在修建的水库大坝。
    据南方日报消息　珠江三角洲的中山、番顺、南海等县，在继续加强防洪戒备的同时，抓紧时机，组织了十四万八千多人，突击抢收夏粮。在两天内，收刈了十一万四千多亩。
    中山县除了出动十多万人进行防洪抢险工作，确保堤围安全以外，还出动六万多人投入抢刈。为了防备特大洪水，各公社都抓紧千金一刻时机，组织抢刈。港口公社的抢收队伍由四千三百多人增加到六千八百多人。公社党委还组织了一百八十个机关干部、职工居民，到各生产队协助抢收。公社的运输队也派出大小船只协助运输。供销部门还准备了炭炉和木炭，支援各生产队处理湿谷。全县在二天内，已抢刈早稻四万一千多亩。许多公社在等价交换原则下，组织队与队之间劳动力、工具协作，由抢刈任务较轻的地区支援任务重的地区，大大加快抢刈速度。
    番顺县番禺地区在暴雨过后，各公社党委书记和各大队干部，纷纷深入各队，采取一手抓防洪、一手抓抢刈办法，两项工作同时进行。在抢刈中，根据各人特长，组织了快收、快打和翻打、检谷的专业队伍，并且组成联合验收队，实行专业分工，人人专责到底，天天评比验收，边收边打，边运边入仓，从而迅速掀起了抢收细收的高潮。各地为了与洪水抢粮食，想出许多办法提高抢刈效率。
    在抢刈同时，各县都积极采取了有效措施，防止谷粒出芽，避免粮食受损失。有的公社把抢刈回来的禾稻分户进行管理，由社员包脱粒、包焙干；有的用干谷器或焙谷场、焙谷炉焙谷；有些公社充分利用房屋、?砖，进行薄摊、勤翻；也有的用沸水烫谷、盐水拌谷等，这些办法都收到了良好的效果。
