Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, June 17th: The production of daily-use industrial products in Lanzhou has developed rapidly. From January to May this year, the output value of light industrial products in the city increased 1.9 times compared with the same period last year; the variety of daily-use industrial products has greatly increased. Items such as rubber shoes, thermos bottles, soap, enamelware, glassware, leather shoes, woolen cloth, and ink are now more than self-sufficient.

While giving priority to the development of heavy industry, Lanzhou has built and expanded more than 500 light industrial factories in the past year. Among them are light industrial factories that use the side materials, waste materials, and by-products of large-scale industry as raw materials to produce paraffin wax, dry batteries, etc.; there are newly built cotton textile factories, knitting factories, and wool textile factories. Each district and each street, under the principle of self-reliance and making use of existing conditions, has also established a number of small factories. These district-run factories and street-level small factories mostly started "from scratch," first using manual labor or old equipment for production, and then gradually realizing semi-mechanized or mechanized production with their accumulated funds. They use waste products collected in urban areas, and after sorting and processing, produce a wide variety of small commodities such as buttons, brushes, children's shoes, toys, and soap boxes.

Some of Lanzhou's original light industrial factories with low output and backward technology have also undergone a completely new transformation after technical renovation based on self-reliance. Before the technical renovation, the Northwest Wool Textile Factory could only produce very coarse uniform cloth with very low output; now, not only has the production capacity increased several times, but it can also produce new products such as flannel, navy cloth, and Harris tweed. The Lanzhou Glass Factory could only manufacture relatively rough products such as medicine bottles and wine bottles in the past, but now it can also produce colored glass cups, thermometers, and beautiful decorative glassware.

At present, the light industrial factories in Lanzhou are carrying out a high-quality, high-yield, and low-cost movement, striving to produce more and better products for the market.

    轻工业生产能力增长生产技术提高
    兰州部分日用品自给有余
    新华社兰州17日电　兰州市日用工业品的生产有了迅速的发展。今年1月至5月全市轻工业品的产值，比去年同期增长了一点九倍；日用工业品的品种已大大增加，像胶鞋、热水瓶、肥皂、搪瓷用品、玻璃器皿、皮鞋、呢料、墨水等已自给有余。
    在优先发展重工业的同时，一年来，兰州市新建和扩建了五百多个轻工业工厂。其中有利用大工业的边材废料和副产品作原料的生产洋蜡、干电池等的轻工业工厂；有新建的棉纺织厂、针织厂、毛纺厂；各区、各街道，在自力更生因陋就简的原则下，也办起了一批小工厂。这些区办工厂和街道小工厂，大都是“白手起家”，先用手工或旧设备生产，再用自己积累的资金，逐步实现半机械化或机械化生产。他们利用市区收集的废品，经过整理和加工，制成了钮扣、刷子、童鞋、玩具、肥皂盒等名目繁多的小百货。
    兰州原有的一些产量低、技术落后的轻工业工厂，在自力更生的基础上经过技术改造以后，面貌也焕然一新了。西北毛纺厂在进行技术改造前，只能生产很粗的制服呢，产量也很低；现在，不仅生产能力提高了好几倍，而且还能生产法兰绒、海军呢、海力斯等新产品。兰州玻璃厂以前只能制造药瓶、酒瓶等比较粗糙的产品，现在也已能生产彩花玻璃杯、温度计和美丽的装饰玻璃器皿。
    目前兰州市的轻工业工厂正在开展优质、高产、低成本运动，力争为市场生产更多更好的产品。
