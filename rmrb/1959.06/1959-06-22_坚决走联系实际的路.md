    Resolutely Take the Path of Linking Theory with Practice

    The scientific workers of the Cotton Insect Working Team of the Institute of Entomology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, have become vanguards in the battle against insect pests, regarded as good teachers and helpful friends by veteran farmers and cadres leading production. This is in stark contrast to the previous situation where some entomologists were unwilling to go to the fields, fearing that old farmers would ask how to prevent and control a certain insect pest and they would be unable to answer.

    The method by which the Cotton Insect Working Team achieved this success is to resolutely take the path of linking theory with practice. They adopted a down-to-earth attitude, closely relied on the leadership of the local Party committee, and deeply engaged in mass work, gaining the understanding, help, and care of the masses. They took the right path.

    The benefits of doing so are: first, providing a guarantee for the leap forward in production, letting people see how inseparable science and production are; second, enriching the research of entomology, which will make it possible to quickly discover many new laws of insect activity and find new methods of pest control.

    We wish them greater success on the road of linking theory with practice, to better complete the tasks assigned by production practice, and to contribute to the development of entomology.

    坚决走联系实际的路
    中国科学院昆虫研究所棉虫工作队的科学工作者们成了向虫害进军的尖兵，被老农们和领导生产的干部们当作良师益友。这同以前有的昆虫学家不愿到田间，怕老农问起某一虫害如何防治而回答不出的景况是多么鲜明的对比。
    棉虫工作队取得这一成绩的办法，是坚决走联系实际的路。他们采取实实在在的态度，紧密地依靠当地党委的领导，深入地做群众工作，取得群众的了解、帮助和关怀。他们走对了路。
    他们这样做的好处是：第一，为生产跃进提供了保证，让人们看到科学与生产是多么地密不可分；第二，丰富了昆虫学的研究，将有可能迅速地发现许多新的昆虫的活动规律和找到新的防治虫害的方法。
    祝他们在理论联系实际的路上取得更大的成绩，更好地完成生产实际赋予的任务，又能为昆虫学的发展作出贡献。
