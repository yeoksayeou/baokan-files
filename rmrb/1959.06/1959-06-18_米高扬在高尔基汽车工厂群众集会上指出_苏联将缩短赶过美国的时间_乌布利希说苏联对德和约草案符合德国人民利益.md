    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 17th - Newspapers here today published the speeches of Walter Ulbricht, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, and Anastas Mikoyan, First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, at a mass rally at the Gorky Automobile Factory on the 15th.
    In his speech, Ulbricht said that the Soviet government acted entirely in accordance with the national interests of our people when it presented the draft treaty with Germany to Western countries. The government of the German Democratic Republic supports this draft. Ulbricht emphasized that the significance of the national question of the German people lies in guaranteeing peace for Germany and stopping West German militarism through fraternal cooperation with the Soviet working people and the countries of the socialist camp.
    Referring to the West German militarists' plans to implement atomic armament in West Germany and organize armed forces by the end of 1961, Ulbricht said that contrary to the war preparation plans, we put forward a peace plan, and we will surpass West Germany in terms of residents' living standards by the end of 1961.
    He emphasized that the solution to the German question depends on the united action of the entire German working class and all peace-loving forces of the German people.
    In his speech, Mikoyan emphasized that the Soviet Union has begun striving to complete the Seven-Year Plan (1959-1965) in six years instead of seven, which is a great leap forward towards communism. He said that this is of great significance. We will obtain the abundant goods to be produced during the Seven-Year Plan one year in advance and overtake the United States earlier.
    Mikoyan said that based on the achievements of the German Democratic Republic, one can conclude what impact socialist ideas can have once they inspire the masses. Mikoyan emphasized that, therefore, we are very happy about the achievements of the German Democratic Republic, which is advancing along the road of socialist construction.
    After talking about the achievements of socialist construction in the German Democratic Republic, Mikoyan said that in the past eight years, the trade volume between the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic has increased by 3.7 times, the annual commodity turnover has reached 6.5 billion rubles, and the cooperation between the two countries in production has also achieved good results.
    Mikoyan said that the Soviet Union also advocates expanding trade with capitalist countries and hopes to coexist peacefully with them.
    Xinhua News Agency, 17th - According to TASS, Moscow: The delegation of the German Democratic Republic party and government headed by Ulbricht and Grotewohl, after visiting various parts of the Soviet Union, returned to Moscow from Gorky by car on the morning of the 17th.

    米高扬在高尔基汽车工厂群众集会上指出
    苏联将缩短赶过美国的时间
    乌布利希说苏联对德和约草案符合德国人民利益
    新华社莫斯科17日电　此间报纸今天刊登了德国统一社会党中央委员会第一书记乌布利希和苏联部长会议第一副主席米高扬15日在高尔基汽车工厂群众集会上的讲话。
    乌布利希在讲话中说，苏联政府在向西方国家提出对德和约草案时，它是完全根据我国人民民族利益行事的。德意志民主共和国政府支持这个草案。乌布利希着重指出，德国人民民族问题的意义在于：通过同苏联劳动人民和社会主义阵营各国的兄弟合作，保证德国的和平，制止西德军国主义。
    在谈到西德军国主义者计划到1961年底在西德实行原子武装和组织武装力量时，乌布利希说，与战备计划相反，我们提出和平计划，我们要在1961年底在居民生活水平方面超过西德。
    他着重指出，德国问题的解决，取决于整个德国工人阶级和德国人民所有爱好和平力量的行动一致。
    米高扬在讲话中着重指出，苏联已开始争取在六年内，而不是在七年内完成七年计划（1959—1965年），这是向共产主义的阔步前进。他说，这有重大意义。我们将提前一年获得在七年计划期间所要生产的丰富商品，并提早赶过美国。
    米高扬说，根据德意志民主共和国的成就，人们可以断定，一旦社会主义思想鼓舞着人民群众，它就能够产生什么影响。米高扬着重说，因此，我们对正在沿着社会主义建设道路前进的德意志民主共和国的成就感到非常高兴。
    米高扬在谈到了德意志民主共和国社会主义建设的成就以后说，在过去的八年中，苏联同德意志民主共和国之间的贸易额增加了三点七倍，每年的商品周转额达到了六十五亿卢布，两国在生产上的合作也获得良好成果。
    米高扬说，苏联也主张扩大同资本主义国家的贸易。并希望同它们和平共处。
    新华社17日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：以乌布利希和格罗提渥为首的德意志民主共和国党政代表团，在苏联各地访问后，于17日早晨乘车从高尔基市回到莫斯科。
