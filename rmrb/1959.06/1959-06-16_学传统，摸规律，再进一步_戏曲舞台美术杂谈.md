Learning from Tradition, Understanding Patterns, and Moving Forward
——Miscellaneous Thoughts on Stage Art in Traditional Opera
Lu Tian

In recent years, scenery has appeared in many traditional and newly composed opera programs. I heard that some opera audiences ask whether the opera being performed has "scenery" when buying tickets. It seems that the audience warmly welcomes scenery in traditional opera. Under the guidance of the Party's policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, weed through the old to bring forth the new," thanks to the efforts of opera stage art workers, the audience's demands in this regard have been basically met. And in the specific work of weeding through the old to bring forth the new, the achievements are even more significant. Almost all opera genres across the country have universally adopted scenery, and various reforms have been carried out in opera art. Scenery has been used in modern plays, newly written historical plays, and traditional old plays. The variety of opera scenery styles is too numerous to mention. The stage art of our opera programs going abroad has also aroused great interest and praise from international friends. In order to better meet the needs of the audience and improve the artistic quality of opera scenery a step further, we should not be satisfied with the existing achievements. At present, the scenery and performance styles of some performances are not harmonious enough. Specifically, how to achieve the unity of style between the fixed space of opera scenery and the dance space of performance is indeed a problem that has not been well resolved for a long time. If this problem can be solved through in-depth and extensive research and specific practice, it will help to further improve the artistic quality of opera scenery at present.

Without inheritance, there can be no development; without learning from tradition, it is difficult to talk about innovation. Young opera actors first practice basic skills and learn single excerpts; opera music workers also have to start with melodies and percussion patterns. In contrast, the "foundation" and "basic skills" of opera stage art workers are much less impressive. Some opera stage art workers come from opera and drama units, and often unconsciously move the stage art of opera and drama to the opera stage without any changes, lacking a deep exploration and research of traditional opera stage art. There are also cases where some theater troupes have two sets of stage art: performing traditional operas is one thing, and performing new operas (with scenery) is another; the former is "management" and the latter is "creation." It is probably not an isolated phenomenon that art designers are not familiar with facial makeup, applying adhesives, or stage management, and do not seriously study traditional art heritages such as headwear, costumes, and properties. As for exploring the artistic principles of traditional stage art, it is even more out of the question. If our opera stage art design is not commensurate with the excellent performance art, the artistic quality is not high enough, and the problem of unity with the performance style has not been completely solved, it is probably an important reason why opera stage art workers do not pay enough attention to the inheritance of traditional opera stage art. We say that opera stage art needs to be innovated and developed, but this does not mean ignoring the characteristics of opera performance art and starting all over again. Innovation and development should be based on the traditional devices of national opera stage art, which is beyond doubt. The purpose of all drama scenery is nothing more than to enhance the performance, render the atmosphere, and explain the occasion, but the stage art of traditional opera seems to focus on directly enhancing the performance. It is completely different from the expression methods of drama stage art. In drama, before the characters appear, the scenery basically has to explain a certain occasion (what place it is) and render the atmosphere (whether it is a good house or a dilapidated house). After the characters appear, the performance actions must be absolutely adapted to the scenery on the stage (such as entering from outside the door, and opening the window only after entering; there can be no action of opening the window without entering the house). Opera is the opposite. The properties on the stage must be absolutely adapted to the actor's performance movements. One table and two chairs cannot explain any environment. Only after the dragon set goes on stage and the official appears and sits down with the majestic musical rhythm of "keng qie, qie, qie,..." can it be explained that this is the environment of a court. Leaving the performance and music, one table and two chairs cannot, like drama scenery, explain what environment this is. Although the properties have great adaptability to the performance, they cannot complete the task without performance and music. Therefore, regardless of the artistic laws of opera performance, simply using scenery that is merely explanatory on the opera stage, although it also explains the occasion and renders the atmosphere, it is difficult to further coordinate with the performance style. Of course, opera scenery should boldly absorb and use the advanced scientific conditions on the modern stage, but it cannot violate its adaptability to the stylized opera performance. Only by fully grasping the creative laws of traditional opera stage art can advanced scientific conditions play an artistic role in opera scenery. Arranging realistic water patterns and mountain pieces on the background of "Autumn River" is contradictory to the performance of running in a circle, because the scenery only achieves the purpose of explaining the occasion and rendering the environmental atmosphere, but does not further directly enhance the singing and dancing of the performance. Therefore, there is an uncoordinated phenomenon of running in a circle in front and the mountains and rivers not moving behind, which destroys the reality of the performance. Yue Opera "Snowy Ferry" not only uses modern scientific conditions (lighting, etc.), but also combines the traditional creative laws of stage art. The entire sky curtain is covered with patterned snowflakes, which is not a realistic explanation of the occasion, but has a strong decorative art flavor, diluting the fixed feeling of the stage device, and is very coordinated with the graceful dance of the actors walking in a circle. It inherits and enriches the old-fashioned device features (the decorative and adaptability to the performance), and has a specific environment (wind and snow) compared to the old-fashioned, but its explanation of the environment is not as realistic and specific as "Autumn River" (is this by the roadside or in front of the village), so the actors have sufficient performance space; the appearance of the scenery does not destroy the realism of the actors' performance at all, but plays a direct role in enhancing it, and also vividly explains the occasion. Even when explaining the occasion, traditional stage art has its own unique techniques, such as the device technique of combining scenery and props, and the artistic modeling of combining reality and virtuality... all are unique. The city of "Empty City Stratagem" is both "scenery" and can be regarded as "props" (of course, these simple furnishings still need to be improved and developed). The properties appearing on the stage are not the original appearance in life, but highly processed art images, which are coordinated with the virtual and stylized dance movements. Through the performance of the actors, the audience has a sense of reality about the environment on the stage, and the entire and detailed parts of the properties do not emphasize mutual verification. For example, Mo Ji wears rich clothes to indicate that the clothes are broken, but his collar and sleeves are complete, and the brokenness of the rich clothes is not like a hole in a broken clothes in life, but just a few pieces of patterned cloth are attached. Only through the performance of the actors and the audience's association can the reality of the stage effect be produced. How can there be complete water sleeves if the clothes are broken? Because the details of the patches and the whole body do not emphasize mutual proof, the actor's performance makes the audience have stage trust. This is one of the creative laws of traditional stage art. Drama is an art of emotion, and all stage movements exist to express certain emotions. For example, after Yao Qi accepts the Empress's toast, he sings and acts while holding the wine glass, just to express his complicated mood of being favored and grateful, and also uneasy of "accompanying the Emperor is like accompanying a tiger." The wine glass is directly combined with the actor's performance. As for the banquet (wine and dishes) that explains the occasion, because the audience trusts this stage environment from the actor's exaggerated drinking movements, it is not necessary to use too much explanatory table of wine and dishes to verify the reality of the environment. At the same time, because the actor's performance has virtual movements (such as entering the door and opening the door), the "virtual" of no wine and dishes on the table does not destroy the "real" of the actor holding the cup. By the same token, contradictory factors in life (large and small, virtual and real, plane and three-dimensional, dynamic and static, black and white...) are often unified in the art of traditional opera stage. For example, the three-dimensional and dynamic car in life becomes a flat and static "car flag" on the stage. The traditional opera stage art has virtual and real, both meticulous brushwork and freehand brushwork, which do not emphasize mutual proof or exclusion, and are all unified through performance. It has undergone a high degree of artistic deformation, like a flower in a pattern, which comes from life, but is more artistic and thought-provoking than the flower in life. Therefore, the artistic style of decorative paintings and pattern paintings, which has the artistic effect of enhancing and rendering, is very suitable for opera stage art.

We have already had some successful experiences in exploring this artistic style. For example, in the final memorial scene of Henan Opera "Liu Hulan", a red light appeared on the sky curtain, showing the yellow sickle and axe patterns. The entire stage, under this revolutionary red flag, appeared so solemn. The appearance of this red flag explained the content that many actors' actions and dialogues did not fully express. It is truly a case of silence being better than sound. The stage was silent, and the audience's mood was the same as the people on the stage, deeply moved by Liu Hulan's spirit of "living greatly and dying gloriously." The image of this flag is not in life, just as there are no car flags or wind flags in life. It is "virtual," while the actors' memorial performance movements for Liu Hulan on the stage are "real." The flag is not a real object but appears in the sky. Isn't this artistic deformation more attractive, more thought-provoking, and more artistically charming than a real flag? This design is very much in the style of opera.

However, some opera scenery inappropriately uses realistic scenery and props, abandoning the unique artistic deformation and freehand style of opera stage art, which undoubtedly runs counter to the performance style. In this way, it can often only "match" the scenery for the opera. Although this matching also meets part of the audience's requirements for scenery, it is still inevitably separated from the performance and needs to be improved in order to achieve a complete stage art creation that combines the characteristics of the performance style.

In addition, the contradiction between virtual movements and the use of scenery is also a problem worth exploring. In the past, some people believed that the scope of opera scenery was limited by virtual movements. It seems that with virtual movements (such as opening and closing doors), it is difficult for scenery to have a "way out." We know that the historical process of the development of singing and dancing may be like this: "When words are not enough, they are prolonged. When prolonged words are not enough, they are sung. When singing is not enough," then dances of hands, feet etc. are produced. Opera is a most intense emotional art. When dance cannot express rich emotions, virtual space appears. For example, in martial arts scenes, it is clear that the enemy has escaped, and the general has ordered the three armies to take advantage of the victory to pursue. According to the logic of life, of course, the general must also rush down, but the general instead shows off his spear skills on the stage, using the virtual space to prominently and fully express his victorious mood. After further processing in these actions, a set of strict artistic stylized movements are formed (such as the "Qi Ba," which describes the energetic dressing movements before going on an expedition). Therefore, virtual and stylized dance movements are one of the main features that distinguish opera from other musical and dance drama performances. Riding a horse with a riding crop is an artistic stylized movement that has been highly ingeniously refined from life. It is completely different from the "simulation" movement of children using bamboo poles as horses. The former is a high-level work of art, while the latter is just a simple and original simulation of life movements. If these dances (virtual and stylized movements) only serve to explain the environment to the audience, it is undoubtedly confusing virtuality and simulation, and essentially canceling the characteristics of opera performance from the root (of course, there are also individual scenes that are lengthy and the virtual movements are too tedious in the repertoire, and the scenes and movements need to be further refined, which will not be discussed in this article). The scope of opera scenery is not only not reduced because of virtual movements, on the contrary, the main scope of opera scenery is to create a national opera scenery style by combining these performance characteristics.

In this regard, we have already had many successful examples: Kunqu Opera "Fifteen Strings of Cash," Ping Opera "Qin Xianglian," and the White Tiger Hall scene of Peking Opera "Wild Boar Forest" have been processed and enriched in terms of property furnishings, which not only did not hinder virtual movements, but greatly enhanced the performance. Of course, some traditional artistic laws (including virtual performance movements) must also be developed. In the past, due to economic conditions and the characteristics of performance art, the use of actors' performances and the audience's association on the stage could explain the environment. In the future, with the vigorous development of scientific conditions and stage art, in addition to this means, more and more perfect artistic means will appear. In short, in order to further improve the artistic quality of opera scenery, while continuing to innovate boldly, it is still necessary to further explore the foundation of traditional opera stage art. Therefore, opera stage art workers should learn from the old artists and masters, inherit the traditional stage art well, especially those device laws with unique styles, and lay a solid foundation, and the quality of our opera stage art design will definitely be greatly improved, and the long-standing contradiction between scenery and performance style will definitely be solved.

    学传统，摸规律，再进一步
    ——戏曲舞台美术杂谈
    鲁田
    近年来，在传统和新编的很多戏曲节目里都出现了布景；听说有的戏曲观众在买票时，先问演的戏有没有“布景”；看来观众是热情地欢迎戏曲有布景的。在党的“百花齐放、推陈出新”的方针指导下，由于戏曲舞台美术工作者的努力，基本上满足了观众这方面的要求。而在推陈出新的具体工作上，成绩更为显著。全国各剧种几乎普遍地采用了布景；进行了各种戏曲美术的改革工作；不论是现代戏、新编历史剧和传统老戏都用了布景；戏曲布景风格样式之多，不胜枚举；我们出国的戏曲节目的舞台美术也引起国际朋友的莫大兴趣和好评。为了更好地满足观众的需要，使戏曲布景艺术质量提高一步，我们不应该满足现有的成绩。目前，有的演出布景和表演风格还不够和谐；具体的说，戏曲布景的固定空间和表演的舞蹈空间如何达到风格的统一，的确是一个长时期以来还没有很好解决的问题。如果，对这一问题经过深入而广泛的研究和具体实践，获得了解决，是有助于当前进一步提高戏曲布景的艺术质量的。
    不继承就不能发展，不学习传统，很难谈到创新。戏曲青年演员首先是练基本功，学单折子戏；戏曲音乐工作者也得从曲牌、锣鼓经着手。相形之下，戏曲舞台美术工作者的“打底子”和“基本功”就显得很逊色了。有些戏曲舞台美术工作者，来自歌剧和话剧单位，常常不自觉地把歌剧和话剧的舞台美术原封不动地搬到戏曲舞台上来，对传统的戏曲舞台美术缺乏深刻的探讨和研究。还有这样的情况：有些剧团的美术工作有两个摊子，演传统戏是一回事，演新戏（带景的戏）又是一回事；前者是“管理”，后者是“创作”。美术设计者不熟悉脸谱、贴片子、捡场，不认真研究盔头、服装、砌末（即道具）等传统美术遗产的，恐怕不是个别现象，至于对传统舞台美术的艺术原理进行探讨，那就更谈不上了。如果说我们的戏曲舞台美术设计和卓越的表演艺术还很不相称，艺术质量还不够高，和表演的风格统一的问题还未彻底解决的话，戏曲舞台美术工作者对传统的戏曲舞台美术的继承工作重视得不够，恐怕是重要的原因之一。我们说戏曲舞台美术需要革新和发展，但是并不等于说不顾戏曲表演艺术的特点去另起炉灶。革新和发展应以民族戏曲舞台美术的传统装置作基础，这是不用怀疑的。一切戏剧布景不外是要达到烘托表演、渲染气氛、说明场合等目的，但是传统戏曲的舞台美术似乎着重的是直接的烘托表演。它和话剧舞台美术的表现方法截然不同，在话剧里，人物未上场，布景基本上要说明一定的场合（是什么地方），渲染了气氛（是好房子，还是破旧房子），人物出场后，表演动作要绝对适应于场上的景物（如从门外入内，入内后才能开窗，不进屋就不能有开窗的动作）。而戏曲恰恰相反，场上的砌末要绝对去适应演员的表演动作，一桌两椅不能说明什么环境，上了龙套，官儿随着“坑切，切，切，……”威严的音乐节拍出场归坐后，才能说明这是公堂的环境。离开了表演和音乐，一桌两椅不能像话剧布景那样，说明这是什么环境，砌末对表演虽有很大的适应性，但它在完成任务时不能离开表演和音乐。因此，不顾戏曲表演的艺术规律，在戏曲舞台上仅仅是说明性的用布景，虽然也交代了场合、渲染了气氛，但是很难进一步和表演风格协调。戏曲用景当然要大胆地吸收和运用近代舞台上的先进科学条件，但不能违背它对戏曲程式表演的适应性，只有充分掌握传统戏曲舞台美术的创作规律，先进的科学条件在戏曲布景里才能发挥艺术作用。在“秋江”的背景上布置出逼真的水纹和山片，同表演的跑圆场有矛盾，就在于布景只做到了说明场合，渲染了环境气氛，而没有进一步直接地烘托表演的歌舞，所以呈现出前面跑圆场后面山水不动的不协调现象，破坏了表演的真实感。越剧“风雪摆渡”既运用了近代科学条件（灯光等），又结合了舞台美术传统的创作规律，整个天幕布满了图案造形的雪花，不是逼真的说明场合，装饰艺术味道很浓，冲淡了舞台装置的固定感，和演员走圆场的优美舞姿很协调，继承并丰富了守旧的装置特点（对表演的装饰性和适应性），比守旧有了具体环境（风雪），但它说明环境又不像“秋江”那样逼真具体（这是路旁，还是村前），所以演员有充分的表演空间；布景的出现对演员表演的真实感一点没有破坏，而是起了直接的烘托作用，也形象地说明了场合。就是说明场合，传统舞台美术里也有它独特的手法，如布景道具合一的装置手法，虚实结合的艺术造型……都是别具一格的。“空城计”的布城既是“景”，也能算“道具”（当然，这些因陋就简的陈设还须提高与发展）。台上出现的砌末都不是生活中的本来面貌，而是经过高度加工的美术形象，它和虚拟、程式的舞蹈动作是协调的，通过演员的表演，使得观众对台上的环境产生真实感，而砌末的全部和细部不强调相互证实。比如，莫稽穿富贵衣表示衣服破了，但是他的衣领、袖子很完整，而富贵衣的破也不是和生活中的破衣服那样有个窟窿，只是贴上几块图案形的花布，通过演员的表演、观众的联想，才产生舞台效果的真实感。既是破衣怎么会有完整的水袖呢？因为补钉的细节和全身不强调相互证明，演员的表演就使得观众产生了舞台信任、这是传统舞台美术的创作规律之一。戏剧是感情的艺术，一切舞台动作都是为了表现一定的感情才存在的。比如姚期接受娘娘的敬酒以后，他拿着酒杯又唱又做，无非是借以表达他受宠感恩，又有“伴君如伴虎”忐忑不安的复杂心情，酒杯直接结合了演员的表演，至于说明场合的宴席（酒、菜）因为从演员的夸张的喝酒动作中使观众信任了这个舞台环境，就不必用过多的说明性的一桌酒菜来证实环境的真实性了。同时，因为演员的表演动作有虚拟的动作（如进门、开门），所以桌上无酒菜的“虚”，并不破坏演员举杯的“实”。同一个道理，在生活中对立的诸因素（大与小，虚与实，平面与立体，动与静，黑与白……）在传统戏曲舞台的美术中常常把这些对立的因素统一起来。如生活中立体的动荡的车变成舞台上平面的、静止的“车旗”。传统的戏曲舞台美术有虚有实，既有工笔，也有写意，彼此之间不强调互相证明，也不互相排斥，都通过表演统一起来了。它经过高度的艺术变形，好像一朵图案中的花，虽来自生活，但比生活中的花更富有艺术性，更耐人寻味。所以，具有烘托、渲染艺术作用的装饰画和图案画的艺术风格，对戏曲舞台美术是非常适用的。
    对这样艺术风格的探讨，我们已经有了一些成功的经验。比如，豫剧“刘胡兰”最后追悼一场，天幕上出现一片红光，显出了黄色的镰刀、斧头的图样，整个舞台在这一面革命的红旗下，显得是那么庄严，这面红旗的出现，说明了多少演员动作、说白没有尽情表达的内容，真是此时无声胜有声，台上一片穆静，观众的心情和台上的人一样，被刘胡兰“生的伟大、死的光荣”的精神深深地感动。这面旗子的形象是生活中没有的，正如生活中没有车旗、风旗一样，它是“虚”的，而演员在台上为刘胡兰的追悼表演动作是“实”的，旗子不是实物而又出现在天空，这种艺术变形，不是比真旗子更吸引人、更耐人深思、更有艺术魅力吗？这种设计是很有戏曲风格的。
    但是，有些戏曲布景不适当地用逼真的布景、道具，放弃了戏曲舞台美术的独特的艺术变形的写意风格，无疑的和表演风格就背道而驰了。这样，常常只能做到为戏曲“配”景，虽然，这种配景也满足观众对布景的部分要求，但毕竟不免与表演分立，还需提高一步，以便做到结合表演风格的特点完整地进行舞台美术创造。
    此外，对虚拟动作和用景的矛盾也是很值得我们探讨的一个问题。过去，曾经有人认为戏曲用景的范围受了虚拟动作的限制。好像有了虚拟动作（如开门、关门）布景很难有“生路”。我们知道，歌舞发展的历史过程可能是这样的，“言之不足，故长言之，长言之不足，故咏歌之，咏歌之不足，”就产生了手之舞之足之蹈之的舞蹈，戏曲是一种最强烈的感情艺术，当舞蹈还不能表达丰富感情的时候，就出现了虚拟的空间，如武打戏里，分明敌人已逃跑，大将已令三军乘胜追击，按生活的逻辑来讲，当然大将也得急忙奔下，但大将在场上反而大耍枪花，用虚拟的空间突出地尽情地畅述他得胜的心情。在这些动作里经过再加工，就形成一套严格的艺术程式动作（如描写精神抖擞的出征前的整装动作就有了“起霸”）。因此，虚拟和程式舞蹈动作正是戏曲有别于其他歌舞剧表演的主要特征之一。马鞭趟马是从生活中经过高度匠心提炼出来的艺术程式动作，它和小孩以竹竿代马的“模拟”动作根本是两回事，前者是高级的艺术品，后者只是简单的原始模拟的生活动作。如果说，这些舞蹈（虚拟和程式动作），只是起到向观众交代环境的作用的话，无疑的是把虚拟和模拟混为一谈，实质上从根本上取消了戏曲表演的特色（当然，也有个别场子冗长，虚拟动作太絮烦的剧目，场子和动作需要进一步精炼，本文暂不谈）。戏曲布景的范围不仅不是因为虚拟动作使得它缩小了，相反的，戏曲布景主要的范围正是要结合这些表演特色创造出一种民族戏曲的布景风格来。
    在这方面我们已有了不少成功的范例：昆曲“十五贯”、评剧“秦香莲”、京剧“野猪林”白虎堂一场，从砌末陈设上进行了加工和丰富，不仅对虚拟动作没有妨碍，反而大大地烘托了表演。当然，传统的一些艺术规律（包括虚拟的表演动作）也要发展，过去，由于经济条件和表演艺术特点的缘故，舞台上运用演员表演和观众的联想能交代环境，今后，科学条件和舞台艺术的蓬勃发展，除了这种手段以外，会出现更多、更完美的艺术手段。总之，为了进一步提高戏曲布景的艺术质量，在继续大胆革新的同时，再深入地摸摸传统戏曲舞台美术的底，还是很必要的。因此，戏曲舞台美术工作者向老艺人，老师傅学习，好好地继承传统的舞台美术，特别是那些有独特风格的装置规律，扎扎实实地打下良好的基础，我们戏曲舞台美术设计的质量一定会大大提高，长期以来布景和表演风格不统一的矛盾定会迎刃而解了。
