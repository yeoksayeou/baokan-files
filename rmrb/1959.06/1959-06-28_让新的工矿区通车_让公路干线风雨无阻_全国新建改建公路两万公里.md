Xinhua News Agency, June 27th: Opening new industrial and mining production bases to traffic, ensuring that major highway routes remain open in all weather conditions, and that river crossings operate day and night—these are the goals set by highway construction workers in our country this year.

In the first five months of this year, nearly 20,000 kilometers of highways have been newly built or reconstructed nationwide. Of these, more than 11,800 kilometers were newly built, and more than 7,000 kilometers were reconstructed. Most of the newly built highways connect towns and major transportation routes, extending to emerging industrial and mining areas. The thirteen short-distance highways under construction in Fujian Province this year, and the eight highways being built in Henan Province, mostly lead to iron and steel base points, hydroelectric power stations, forest logging sites, and other production factories and mines. In Qinghai, the highways leading to the resource-rich Qilian Mountains and the Qaidam Basin are also continuing to be built. In Shandong, the highway connecting Boshan in the Zibo coal mining area to the Jiaoji Railway was originally only a few meters wide and could not meet the needs of production development. It has been reconstructed this year and will soon be completed.

The quality of the roads on existing lines that have been reconstructed has been greatly improved, thus increasing the mileage of highways that are open in all weather conditions nationwide. In Henan Province, locally sourced materials, such as brick bats and pebbles, were added to the dirt roads, and more than 750 kilometers have been paved in the first five months of this year. After many highways have been repaired, reaching a level of smooth road surfaces and clear side ditches, they not only facilitate driving in rainy weather but also reduce the consumption of gasoline, tires, and automobile parts.

This year, lighting equipment or night crossing signals have been added to some busy ferry crossings on major highway routes. In Guangdong, some ferry crossings have adopted large motorized ferries and the method of linking ferries together to improve the ferry capacity of automobile ferry crossings. Ferry workers in Sichuan Province have created methods such as winch cable ferries and circular towing of ferries, which have also accelerated the speed of automobile river crossings.

The automobile train transportation, which began to be widely promoted nationwide last year, has brought new demands to highway construction. In order to facilitate the operation of automobile trains, more large highway bridges are being built this year than in previous years. There are more than seventy large bridges that have been completed, are under construction, or are being prepared for construction. Many ferry crossings on existing highway routes have been converted into bridges, and many new routes are also reducing the number of ferry crossings and converting them into bridges. Yunnan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, Henan and other places have also reduced the slope of mountain roads and widened the turning points of highways. Guangdong Province has reconstructed more than 400 kilometers.

### 让新的工矿区通车　让公路干线风雨无阻  全国新建改建公路两万公里

    让新的工矿区通车　让公路干线风雨无阻
    全国新建改建公路两万公里
    新华社27日讯　让新的工矿生产基地通车，公路干线晴雨通车，河流渡口日夜通车，这是今年我国公路建设职工提出的奋斗目标。
    今年头五个月，全国已经新建、改建了近两万公里公路。其中有一万一千八百多公里是新建的，有七千多公里是改建的。大多数新建公路联结着城镇和交通干线，向新兴的工矿区伸延。福建省今年修建中的十三条短途公路和河南省修建的八条公路，大都是通往钢铁基点、水电站、森林采伐场和其他生产厂矿的。在青海，通往资源丰富的祁连山区和柴达木盆地的公路，也在继续修筑。山东从淄博煤矿区的博山联结胶济铁路的公路，原来只有几公尺宽，不能适应生产发展的需要，今年已重新加以改建，不久就将竣工。
    经过改建的旧有线路，道路质量大为改善，因而增加了全国晴雨通车的公路里程。河南省就地取材，在土路面上加铺砖碴、石子等，今年头五个月已经铺了七百五十多公里。许多公路经过维修以后，达到路面平整、边沟疏通，不仅便利雨天行车，还减少了汽油、轮胎和汽车机件的消耗。
    在公路干线一些繁忙的渡口，今年增设了照明设备或夜渡信号。广东有一些渡口采用大型机动渡船和联船过渡（将两个渡船连在一起摆渡）的办法，提高了汽车渡口的摆渡能力。四川省的摆渡职工创造了绞车索渡、渡轮循环拖运等方法，也加快了汽车渡河的速度。
    去年开始在全国普遍推广的汽车列车化运输，给公路建设带来了新的要求。为了便利汽车列车行驶，今年建设的大型公路桥梁比往年多，已经建成、正在施工和准备施工的大桥共有七十多座，现有公路干线不少渡口已经改建桥梁，许多新建路线也在减少渡口改设桥梁。云南、广东、广西、湖南、河南等地还降低山区公路的坡度，加宽公路转弯的地方。广东省已改建了四百多公里。
