Breaking Through Clouds and Rain to Rescue Disaster Victims
By Our Correspondent

On the morning of June 16th, dark clouds covered the sky, and the low pressure made the air so stuffy that people were covered in sweat. Female pilots Shi Lixia, Lin Shuyu, and Xue Wenshu, carrying navigation charts and flight caps, stepped into the cockpits of aircraft numbers 08 and 6103 respectively. They were ordered to airdrop food, clothing, medicine, and other relief supplies to the people in the disaster area of the lower reaches of the Dongjiang River in Guangdong, who were surrounded by floods. Facing such adverse weather, Captain Shi Lixia said resolutely: "No matter what kind of clouds, we must break through!"

The planes roared into the sky. Shi Lixia looked out through the cockpit glass, but could see nothing; the gray clouds enveloped the plane. Gusts of headwind constantly struck, causing the fuselage to shake. Suddenly, the fuselage trembled violently, and heavy rain poured down. Shi Lixia concentrated all her attention and, with her skilled technique, continued to advance based on instrument readings. Navigator Lin Shuyu stood nervously to her right rear, unfolding the map with one hand and pointing outward with the other: "Turn right," "Ahead is ××"... In this way, the plane advanced at a speed of more than 200 li per hour.

Seven minutes later, a burst of light suddenly flashed across their cockpit, and the plane broke through the clouds. Shi Lixia and Lin Shuyu almost simultaneously cast their anxious eyes on the ground. Ah! Fierce floods had swallowed beautiful villages and rice fields. In that instant, the thought of "quickly dropping supplies to rescue the people in the disaster area" occupied all their minds. Shi Lixia immediately brought the plane down from an altitude of 300 meters, through the clouds, to 150 meters. Ah! It was clear! The crowds on the hilltops and roads above the water were the disaster victims. Shi Lixia quickly steered the plane to the first drop point - a small hill east of Boluo. She held her breath, made an accurate entry maneuver, and Lin Shuyu, quick-witted and deft, pressed the buzzer. The fried rice thrown out by the airdrop crew landed accurately at the drop point.

When mechanic Su Debao ran to the front cabin to give them a thumbs up, saying the drop was good, they were already heading towards another drop point. In this way, within an hour and a half, they dropped a large amount of supplies at more than ten drop points. That day, in complex weather conditions, they flew five sorties at low altitude, continuously for nearly eight hours, and the accuracy rate of the airdrops reached 100%.

On the third day of the airdrop mission, the weather turned clear, but it was particularly hot and humid. At noon, when Shi Lixia and Lin Shuyu entered the airtight cabin, the thermometer was pointing at 40 degrees Celsius.

This time, they accepted a new and important task: to find a disaster relief point south of Tonghu Lake that had not yet been airdropped. According to reports from relevant departments, the victims there had not had anything to eat for several days. Upon receiving this task, they wished they could find the disaster relief point immediately. Although the plane was exceptionally hot and humid, and Shi Lixia and Lin Shuyu's flight suits were soaked through, they still focused on flying and searching for the target. Suddenly, they spotted a few wisps of smoke rising near Tonghu Lake in Huiyang County, but they could not clearly see any people. Shi Lixia immediately directed the plane to lower its altitude and circled twice over the location where the smoke was rising. Finally, they saw a large group of people gathered on a hilltop resembling a small isolated island. They quickly and accurately dropped the supplies here.

The plane had only three packages of supplies left. Carefully searching for the target, they discovered another group of disaster victims in a nearby field. However, there was water all around, and there were many people. The supplies could easily fall into the water or crush the victims. The situation was so urgent! At this time, Captain Shi Lixia, with her years of flying experience, calmly directed the plane to reduce its speed as much as possible. Lin Shuyu, with her face covered in sweat, stayed close to the pilot, guiding her. When the plane descended to a low altitude of about 50 meters, the waving and cheering of the victims below were clearly visible. "Ring - ring" the alarm sounded, and the last three packages of supplies were thrown out of the cabin, landing accurately on a slope. At this moment, everyone on board smiled with tears in their eyes, and the stuffiness in the cabin and the sweat all over their bodies seemed to disappear.

The Party and government's concern for the disaster victims and the female pilots' heroic spirit of breaking through clouds and rain to rescue them powerfully supported the flood prevention efforts of the disaster victims in the Dongjiang area of Guangdong, and greatly boosted the confidence of the disaster victims in overcoming the floods. Xue Wenshu said that on the first day, after they airdropped a letter of condolences from the provincial leadership, calling on the victims to work together to fight the flood, and a large amount of supplies, the next day, they discovered huge white slogans such as "Long Live Chairman Mao" and "Long Live the Communist Party" on the hilltops where they had airdropped grain. She said, "How much the people love and are grateful to our Party! They believe that as long as they are under the leadership of the Party, they will be able to overcome all difficulties!"

    穿云破雨救灾民
    本报记者
    6月16日清晨，乌云盖满天空，低气压使人气闷得热汗直流。女飞行员施丽霞、林淑玉和薛文淑提着航行图和飞行帽，分别跨进了零八号和六一零三号飞机的座舱。她们是奉命给遭受洪水包围的广东东江下游灾区人民空投食物、被服、药品等救灾物资的。面对着这样恶劣的天气，机长施丽霞发狠地说：“不管什么样的云，都要冲出去！”
    飞机吼叫着进入天空。施丽霞透过座舱玻璃向外望去，什么也看不见，灰蒙蒙的云层把飞机包围住了。一股一股的逆气流不断的袭来，使机身颠簸不定。突然机身一阵震抖，急雨倾盆而下。施丽霞全神贯注，以她娴熟的技术，凭仪表指示继续前进。领航员林淑玉紧张地站立在她的右后方，一手摊开地图，一手向外指点：“向右拐弯”，“前面是××”……。就这样，飞机以每小时二百多里的速度前进。
    七分钟后，光亮骤然掠过她们的座舱，飞机越出云层了。施丽霞和林淑玉几乎是同时把焦急的眼光投向地面，啊！凶猛的洪水吞没了美好的村庄和稻田。就在这一刹那间，“赶快投下物资去抢救灾乡人民”的念头马上占据了她们的全部思想。施丽霞立即将飞机由三百公尺高度穿云下降到一百五十公尺。啊！看清楚了！在那高出水面的山头上、公路上的人群，便是灾民。施丽霞迅速地把飞机开向第一个空投点——博罗的东边小山上。她屏住气，准确地做了个进入动作，林淑玉眼明手快，一按电铃，空投员抛出的炒米便准确地掉落在空投点。
    当机械师苏德宝跑到前舱来向她们竖起大拇指，说投得好的时候，她们已经向着另一个空投点前进了。就这样，一个半小时内，她们一共在十多个空投点投下了大量的物资。这一天，她们在复杂的气象条件下，低空连续飞行了五架次，将近八个小时，空投的命中率达到百分之百。
    空投战斗进行到第三天，天气转晴，但特别闷热。中午时分，施丽霞、林淑玉进入密不通风的机舱时，气温表正指着四十度。
    这次，她们接受了一个新的重要的任务：要寻找铜湖南边一个尚未空投过的灾民点。根据有关方面的报告，那里的灾民已经有几天没有吃上东西了。接到这个任务，她们恨不得马上就能找到这个灾民点。尽管飞机上闷热异常，施丽霞和林淑玉的飞行服也湿透了，但她们仍然专心一致地边飞行边搜索目标。突然，她们发现几缕青烟在惠阳县的铜湖附近升起，但却看不清人群。施丽霞当即指挥飞机降低高度，并在发出青烟的地点上空连绕了两个圈子，终于看到一个像小孤岛似的山头上聚着一大群人。她们迅速而准确地在这儿投下了物资。
    飞机上剩下最后三包物资了。细心搜索着目标的她们又发现了不远处一块土地上有一群灾民。但是，四周是水，人又多，物资很可能投进水里，要不就会压坏灾民。形势是多么紧迫啊！这时，机长施丽霞以她多年的飞行经验，沉着地指挥飞机尽量减小速度。满脸汗水的林淑玉这时紧紧挨近着驾驶员，为她指引方向。当飞机下降到五十公尺左右低空时，下面灾民的招手、欢呼动作已看得清清楚楚。“铃——铃”警号声响了，最后三包物资被抛出机舱，不偏不倚，刚刚投到一块斜坡上。这时候，机上的人都含着泪花笑出了声音，舱里的闷热和通身汗水似乎都随之消失干净了。
    党和政府对灾民的关怀和女飞行员们穿云破雨救灾民的英勇精神有力地支援了广东东江地区灾民的防洪斗争，大大地鼓舞了灾民战胜洪水的信心。薛文淑说，头天，她们空投了省领导机关号召灾民齐心抗洪的慰问信和大量物资后，第二天，她们在空中便发现空投过粮食的山头上出现了“毛主席万岁”、“共产党万岁”等巨大的白字标语。她说：“人民多么热爱和感激我们的党啊！他们相信只要在党的领导下，就能够战胜一切困难！”
