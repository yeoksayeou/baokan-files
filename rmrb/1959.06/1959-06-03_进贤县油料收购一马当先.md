Jinxian County in Jiangxi Province, which has the fastest progress in summer oilseed procurement, has completed 93% of its oilseed procurement plan, with more than 857,000 jin of rapeseed stored. Eleven of the county's twelve communes have completed or overfulfilled their delivery tasks. Compared with the same period last year, the county's oilseed storage progress has accelerated fourteenfold this year.

Widely signing tripartite (state, commune or production team, oil press) contracts for oilseed procurement and processing is an effective way for Jinxian County to accelerate the progress of storage from all aspects. The conscientious implementation of the contract has first established a close connection and cooperation between the state, commune or production team, and the oil press, overcoming the past phenomena of the procurement department waiting for procurement, the commune or production team sending oilseeds to the warehouse and then sending oilseeds to the oil press for processing, and the oil press waiting for oilseeds to arrive, which wasted labor. Secondly, due to the adoption of the method of purchasing oilseeds in the team (or commune), purchasing at the oil press, and processing at the oil press, the procurement department went down to the team to purchase door-to-door, which greatly facilitated the masses' delivery and accelerated the progress of storage. Thirdly, after signing the contract, the commune or production team regularly and quantitatively delivers oilseeds to the oil press with guaranteed quality, and the oil press regularly and quantitatively delivers oil to the state with guaranteed quality, which ensures that the oil purchased by the state is of high quality and stored in a timely manner.

    进贤县油料收购一马当先
    本报南昌2日电　江西省夏季油料征购进度最快的进贤县，已完成了油料收购计划的93％，入库的油菜籽达八十五万七千多斤；全县的十二个公社已有十一个公社完成或超额完成了交售任务。与去年同期比较，今年全县油料入库进度加快了十四倍。
    广泛签订油料收购、加工的三角（国家、公社或生产队、油榨坊）合同，是进贤县从各个环节上加速入库进度的一种有效办法。认真执行合同的结果，首先使国家、公社或生产队和榨坊建立了紧密联系和合作，克服了过去收购部门坐等收购，公社或生产队送油料入库后又送油料去榨坊加工，榨坊等油料上门的费工、窝工现象。其次，由于采取了以榨包队（或社）、就榨收购、就榨加工的办法，收购部门下队上门收购，大大便利了群众交售和加快了入库进度。第三，签订合同后，公社或生产队定期定量定质向榨坊交油料，榨坊定期定量定质向国家交油脂，这就使国家收购的油脂质量高、入库及时。
