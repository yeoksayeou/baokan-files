    Communes Run Transportation

    It is of great significance for people's communes to organize professional transportation teams that focus on transportation and supplement agriculture, undertaking short-distance transportation between urban and rural areas and between main and branch lines.

    Looking at Sichuan, the commune's professional transportation teams have already formed an important part of the entire national transportation undertaking. Communes have enormous manpower and material resources. Whether it is from the perspective of national needs or the production needs of the communes, it is necessary to do this. Especially under the current situation of a great leap forward in national industrial and agricultural production, trunk line transportation is particularly busy. It is necessary for each commune to utilize its own animal power and tools, relying on its own efforts to develop transportation. This is necessary from the perspective of the needs of the country and the development of production within the communes themselves. Many communes, in addition to agricultural production, also have diversified operations in forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries. These productions all require a certain amount of transportation capacity. The commune leadership must consider the overall situation and make unified arrangements to facilitate the development of production.

    公社办运输
    人民公社组织专业运输队，以运为主、以农为辅，担负城乡和干线支线之间的短途运输，是有着重要意义的。
    从四川来看，公社专业运输队已经构成了整个国家运输事业的重要组成部分。公社有着庞大的人力、物力，不论从国家需要或是从公社生产需要出发，都是必要的，特别是在当前全国工农业生产大跃进的形势下，干线运输特别繁忙，各个公社利用自己的畜力和工具，自力更生选办运输事业，这从国家的需要和公社本身发展生产来说，都是必要的。许多公社除农业生产以外还拥有多种经营的林、牧、副渔等业，这些生产都需要一定的运力，公社的领导方面必须全盘考虑，统一安排，以利生产的发展。
