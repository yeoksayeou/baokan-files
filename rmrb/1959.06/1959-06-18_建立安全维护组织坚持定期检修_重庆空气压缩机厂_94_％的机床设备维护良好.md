Establish Safe Maintenance Organizations, Insist on Regular Overhaul
Chongqing Air Compressor Factory Maintains 94% of Machine Tools and Equipment in Good Condition

(Our newspaper, Chongqing, 17th) The experience of Chongqing Air Compressor Factory in doing a good job in equipment maintenance and ensuring normal production has attracted the attention of many machinery factories across the country. Recently, the First Machinery Trade Union and other units held an on-site experience exchange meeting on equipment maintenance and repair at this factory. More than 350 people from more than 30 units across the country came to learn from the experience.

Since the Air Compressor Factory strengthened its equipment maintenance work, equipment accidents and machine tool failures have been significantly reduced. From January to April this year, the percentage of machine tools and equipment in the factory that reached excellent maintenance standards was 94%, while in the same period last year it was only 40%. In the past five months, seven of the factory's thirteen workshops have achieved zero equipment accidents. With the strengthening of maintenance and repair work, equipment accidents and temporary repairs are rare, which has reliably guaranteed normal production.

Since the Great Leap Forward in production last year, the Party Committee of the Air Compressor Factory has attached more importance to the maintenance and repair of machinery and equipment when production tasks are heavy and equipment utilization rates are high. When discussing production, the Party Committee often studies and inspects equipment maintenance work, and makes special maintenance arrangements for important equipment. The Party Committee Secretary and the Factory Director personally lead cadres from various departments to the workshops to inspect and scrub machine tools.

Chongqing Air Compressor Factory has adopted the method of vigorously launching mass movements to do a good job in equipment maintenance. The factory has established and improved mass safety maintenance organizations and systems. All groups in the factory have elected more than 230 worker technical safety maintenance personnel, and technical safety maintenance groups have been established by combining technical safety maintenance personnel from each group, with the workshop as the unit. All groups have formulated group maintenance systems, shift handover systems, daily inspections, and weekly inspections. The establishment of a strong safety maintenance network and maintenance inspection system has played an important role in promoting and ensuring that the factory regularly carries out equipment maintenance work. At the same time, each workshop has also carried out an excellent standard competition for equipment maintenance. The phenomenon of no one cleaning and oiling has disappeared. Seven workshops have achieved complete success in excellent equipment maintenance. In the past, the tool workshop had many accidents, and maintenance personnel were busy with temporary repairs all day long, and the workshop's production plan was often disrupted. Since the beginning of this year, due to the fact that the entire workshop has achieved zero equipment accidents and all groups are producing normally according to plan, the number of more than 20 maintenance personnel in the workshop has been reduced to four.

Chongqing Air Compressor Factory has also conscientiously improved and strengthened the planned pre-inspection system and overhauled equipment on schedule. In the process of breaking with old conventions last year, the factory's mobile department, under the leadership of the factory's Party Committee, conscientiously studied and adopted the opinions of the masses, changed the past situation of sitting in the office to compile plans, and went deep into the workshop to organize electromechanical personnel, maintenance workers, technical safety maintenance personnel, and production team leaders to jointly discuss and compile pre-inspection and pre-repair plans. In the preparation of the new pre-inspection and pre-repair plan, the impractical parts were eliminated, and the plan was compiled in accordance with the combination of various intervals, the actual situation of machine tools, and the production situation, and repairs were carried out as much as possible during the relatively idle production time. In this way, the new pre-inspection and pre-repair system is closely integrated with production and ensures the scheduled maintenance of machinery and equipment. Since the factory has improved and strengthened the pre-inspection and pre-repair system and adhered to the scheduled maintenance of equipment, most of the machines have been operating normally, which has greatly reduced machine tool failures. The factory's equipment utilization rate has increased from 46% in 1957 to 81% last year, and has increased to 91.7% this year.

Chongqing Air Compressor Factory has also conscientiously strengthened safety production education for new workers, and strictly implemented the method of requiring new workers to pass on-site practical operation examinations before they can officially use machine tools, which has played a certain role in reducing accidents and ensuring safety production.

    建立安全维护组织坚持定期检修
    重庆空气压缩机厂94％的机床设备维护良好
    本报重庆17日电  重庆空气压缩机厂做好设备维修、保证生产正常进行的经验，引起了全国许多机械厂的重视。最近第一机械工会等单位在这个厂召开了设备维护修理现场经验交流会，全国三十多个单位、三百五十多人前来学习了经验。
    空气压缩机厂加强设备维修工作以来，设备事故、机床故障都显著减少。今年1至4月份，全厂机床设备达到优秀维护标准的占94％，而去年同期仅有40％。今年五个月来，全厂十三个车间中已有七个车间做到了无设备事故。随着维护修理工作加强，设备事故和临时停修很少，使正常生产得到了可靠的保证。
    去年生产大跃进以来，空气压缩机厂党委在生产任务繁重，设备利用率提高的时候，越加重视机器设备的维护修理工作。党委会在讨论生产的时候，经常研究和检查设备维修工作，对重要设备，都作了专门维护保养的部署。党委书记、厂长还亲自带领科室干部下车间检查和擦洗机床。
    重庆空气压缩机厂作好设备维修保养工作，采取了大搞群众运动的方法。全厂建立和健全了群众性的安全维护组织和制度。全厂各小组共选出工人技术安全维护员二百三十多人，并且以工段为单位，联合各小组的技术安全维护员，建立了技术安全维护小组。各个小组都制订了小组维护制度、交接班制度、日查、周查等制度。强大的安全维护网和维护检查制度的建立，对推动和保证全厂经常做好设备维护工作起了重要作用。同时，各车间还开展了设备维护保养优秀标准竞赛。无人清扫、加油等现象已经绝迹。有七个车间已经达到了设备维护保养优秀满堂红。工具车间过去事故重重，机修人员一天到晚为临时修理忙乱不堪，车间生产计划常被打乱。今年以来，由于全车间做到设备无事故，各组都按计划正常生产，因此，车间的二十多个机修人员已经减少到四个。
    重庆空气压缩机厂还认真改进和加强计划预检制度，按期检修设备。在去年大破陈规过程中，这个厂的机动部门在厂党委的领导下，认真研究和采纳了群众的意见，改变了过去坐在办公室编计划的状况，深入车间组织机电员、机修工人、技术安全维护员和生产组长，共同讨论编制预检预修计划。在编制新的预检预修计划中，消除了脱离实际的部分，按照各种间隔期、机床实际情况和生产情况三者结合进行编制，尽量利用生产较空闲的时间进行检修。这样就使新的预检预修制度既密切结合了生产，又保证了机器设备的按期检修。这个厂在改进和加强预检预修制度、坚持设备按期检修以来，绝大部分机器的运转都很正常，大大减少了机床故障，全厂设备利用率由1957年的46％提高到去年的81％，今年又提高到91.7％。
    重庆空气压缩机厂还认真加强对新工人的安全生产教育，严格执行新工人要经过现场实际操作考试才能正式上机床的办法，对降低事故、保证安全生产起了一定作用。
