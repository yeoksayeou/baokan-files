Thoughts Inspired by Learning from Xiang Xiuli
    Feng Deyong

    Throughout the country, the call to learn from Xiang Xiuli can be heard everywhere. She inspires our hearts and encourages us to move forward. Her selfless communist spirit will forever shine like the sun, coexisting with humanity for eternity. Countless people are striving to learn from her.
    However, recently we have often encountered individual young people who neglect safety in their work, violating safety operating procedures. Instead of striving to change this, they are proud of it. They call this so-called "dauntless spirit," a "display of not being afraid of death"... and they believe that this is learning from Xiang Xiuli.
    Once, I saw a communication line worker climbing a ten-meter-high electric pole to find a fault, but he did not fasten his safety belt. Someone tried to stop him: "You can't climb the pole without a safety belt!"
    "What's the matter? I can't worry about that now," the young worker said, and climbed up.
    There was a safety belt available, and time to fasten it, but he didn't listen to advice and didn't pay attention to safety, which is very wrong.
    The starting point of this young worker may be to save time and eliminate obstacles as soon as possible, so that communication can be restored smoothly, but the method he adopted was not appropriate. If the situation is urgent (for example, in fierce combat), and the nature of the communication and the severity of the obstacle do not allow us to choose more perfect measures, we should of course bravely complete the task. I remember in the Soviet film "The Great Turning Point," there was such a scene: a telephone line was bombed and broken, and the driver Minutka crawled through heavy artillery fire to connect the telephone. He was wounded and eventually sacrificed, but he held the wire in his mouth, connected the telephone, and completed the task. What a moving scene!
    However, the situations we encounter in our daily work may not be as urgent as those encountered by Xiang Xiuli, Dong Cunrui, and Minutka. Under normal circumstances, we are allowed to think of ways and find measures, and we can completely use appropriate and proper methods to solve problems. But some people, even if they are few, are unwilling to use their brains, fail to recognize the situation around the work site, and cannot use favorable conditions, relying only on a burst of enthusiasm to risk their lives. How can this be regarded as learning from the beloved heroes?
    Here, we might as well look at the specific circumstances of Xiang Xiuli. In daily production, Xiang Xiuli paid great attention to safety and was serious and strict with safety operations, meticulous in every detail. This is a manifestation of a high degree of responsibility to the Party and the people. Precisely because she was like this, the Party specially trusted her and transferred her from a general production post to that particularly dangerous post to ensure safety. The accident occurred because another female worker was careless and dropped a bottle of alcohol. The reason why Comrade Xiang Xiuli gave her life to put out the fire was precisely for the safety of the entire factory and all the employees and their families, not reckless risk-taking. Therefore, strictly paying attention to safety in work and being brave enough to sacrifice when necessary is a unified spirit of responsibility to the Party and the people. We cannot see these two things as opposed to each other. To learn from Xiang Xiuli, we must comprehensively learn her spirit. We must be serious and strict in production with infinite loyalty to the Party and the people; and when facing danger, we must move forward bravely without retreating.

    从学习向秀丽想到的
    冯德勇
    在全国各地，到处都可听到学习向秀丽的声音。她，激励着我们的心，鼓舞着我们前进。她的舍己为人的共产主义精神，将永远像赤日的光芒，与人类永世共存。无数的人都在争着向她学习。
    然而，近来我们常常遇到个别的青年人，工作起来忽视安全，违反了安全操作规程。他们不仅不力求改变，反而以此感到自豪。把这说成是所谓“大无畏精神”，是“不怕死的表现”……并且，以为这就是在向向秀丽学习。
    有一次，我看到一位通信线路工人，要爬到高达十公尺的电杆上去查找障碍，但却不把腰间的保安带系上。当时有人劝止他：“不用保安带可不能上杆子呀！”
    “有啥关系？现在顾不得那许多。”青年工人说着就爬了上去。
    既有保安带，也有时间把它系上，但是，不听劝阻，不注意安全，这就很不对了。
    这位青年工人的出发点也许是想节省点时间，及早排除障碍，使通讯恢复畅通，但是他采用的方法却是不妥善的。如果情况紧急（例如在激烈的战斗中），通讯的性质和障碍的严重性也不能容许我们择取比较完善的措施时，当然也应该奋不顾身地去完成任务。我记得，在苏联影片“伟大的转折”里就有这样一个场面：电话线被炸断了，司机米努特卡为了接通电话，在猛烈的炮火中爬行着，他负了伤，最后牺牲了，但是他把线咬在嘴里，接通了电话，完成了任务。这是一个多么激动人心的场面啊！
    可是，在我们日常工作中所遇到的情况，未必就和向秀丽、董存瑞、米努特卡所遇到的情况那样刻不容缓，在一般的情况下，容许我们想办法，找措施，完全可以利用适当的、妥善的办法来解决问题。但有的人，即使是少数的，他们不肯开动脑筋，不识别工作现场周围的情况，不能利用有利的条件，只是凭一股热劲，去冒生命的危险，这哪里算得上是学习人们敬爱的英雄的表现？
    这里，我们不妨看一看向秀丽的具体情况。向秀丽在日常生产中非常注意安全，对安全操作认真严格，一丝不苟。这是一种对党对人民高度负责的表现。正因她这样，党才特别信任她，把她从一般生产岗位上，调到那个危险性特别大的岗位上去，以保证安全。而那次事故的发生，却是由于另一个女工工作不慎，失手掉落了一个酒精瓶子引起的。向秀丽同志所以要舍身救火，也正是为了整个工厂和全体职工及家属的生命安全，并不是任意冒险。所以，工作中严格注意安全和在必要时勇于牺牲，正是一种统一的对党对人民负责的精神。我们不能把这两者对立起来看。我们要学习向秀丽，正是要全面地学习她的这种精神。要用对党对人民的无限忠心，在生产中认真严格；而在面临危险的时候，又勇往直前，毫不退缩。
