Xinhua News Agency, 8th dispatch. The Ministry of Agriculture issued a notice on the 5th, requiring all regions to take measures to strengthen the prevention and control of pests and diseases in coarse grain crops.

The notice stated: Expanding the production of coarse grain crops such as corn, sorghum, and millet is of great significance for ensuring a bumper agricultural harvest in 1959. They are not only the main food for the people but also essential for livestock feed and light industrial raw materials. Therefore, strengthening the prevention and control of pests and diseases in coarse grain crops is a very important measure to complete or exceed the 1959 grain production increase target.

The notice stated that the characteristics of this year's pests and diseases are: early occurrence, low overwintering mortality, and large numbers. In the North China region, corn borer moths entered their peak emergence and began laying eggs from late May to early June. In Liaocheng and Jinan areas of Shandong Province, corn borer moths emerged seven to twenty days earlier, and the population density was three to thirteen times higher than the same period last year. It is predicted that the first generation of corn borers may have a large-scale outbreak. Millet fields in Hebei, Shandong, Henan, and other provinces have already experienced millet stem borer larvae, with some plots showing deadheart seedlings. It is predicted that the peak of damage will be reached in mid-June. In northern Jiangsu Province, corn and sorghum have suffered from underground pests, generally resulting in a seedling deficiency of about 10%. Judging from the above situation, the pest situation is becoming increasingly tense. Experience has shown that if prevention and control are neglected, production will be reduced by 10% or more. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen prevention and control work and resolutely eliminate pests and diseases in their initial stages. This has become an important task to ensure full seedlings, strong plants, and strive for a comprehensive bumper harvest of coarse grain crops. The notice put forward six opinions on eliminating pests and diseases:

	1. Strengthen leadership and include the prevention and control of pests and diseases of coarse grains as an important part of summer agricultural production. Formulate prevention and control plans, arrange a certain number of pest and insect control labor, and ensure that prevention and control work is not squeezed out due to busy summer production.

	2. To eliminate pests and diseases, it is necessary to be skillful, accurate, and ruthless. Carefully analyze and study pest and disease information, and according to the development of pests and diseases, seize favorable opportunities, organize forces, and adopt comprehensive methods such as manual labor and machinery to launch a swift and decisive attack. In mid-to-late June, a prevention and control campaign should be launched to eliminate millet seedling pests and corn borers in the fields. In the Northeast region, timely elimination of the web-eyed sand borer (a type of beetle) should be carried out, requiring that no plot be missed and no insect be released, to ensure that no seedling is damaged.

	3. All regions must thoroughly implement the policy of "combining foreign and indigenous methods." It is necessary to use chemical agents and equipment economically and rationally, and also mobilize the masses to vigorously develop indigenous pesticides and equipment. The experience of 1958 proves that China has abundant resources for indigenous pesticides and great potential, and some effects are not lower than chemical agents. Therefore, agricultural departments at all levels must closely cooperate with other relevant departments to organize the masses to collect and manufacture indigenous pesticides and to modify and create high-efficiency equipment as early as possible.

	4. The summer harvest and summer planting have arrived. All regions must seize this season, combine plowing and planting, apply poisonous soil and poisonous grain to eliminate underground pests, treat seeds with pesticides, plant disease-free sweet potato seedlings, and establish disease-free breeding bases to systematically breed disease-free seed potatoes. This is the most economical and effective measure to eliminate sweet potato black spot disease.

	5. Remove diseased plants from the fields and thoroughly destroy the source of infection. Early removal, continuous removal, and thorough removal are required, and complete destruction should be carried out.

	6. Summarize prevention and control experience in a timely manner and promote it rapidly. We must encourage the revolutionary spirit of bold creation, but also summarize the experience of "more, faster, better, and more economical" skillful treatment of diseases and insects, and improve the prevention and control work a step further.

    农业部提出六点意见
    严防、巧治杂粮病虫害
    新华社8日讯　农业部5日发出通知，要求各地采取措施加强杂粮作物病虫害的防治工作。
    通知说：扩大玉米、高粱、谷子等杂粮作物的生产，对保证1959年农业丰收，有着重要意义，它不仅是人民主要食粮，也是牲畜饲料、轻工业原料所必需。因此，加强杂粮作物病虫害的防治工作对完成或超额完成1959年粮食增产是一项十分重要的措施。
    通知说，今年病虫害的特点是：发生早，越冬病虫死亡少，数量大。华北地区玉米螟成虫于5月下旬至6月上旬就进入羽化盛期并开始产卵，山东省聊城、济南地区玉米螟成虫提前发生七——二十天，虫口密度比去年同期多三——十三倍，预计一代玉米螟有大发生的可能。冀、鲁、豫等省谷田已发生粟灰螟幼虫，个别地块出现枯心苗，预计6月中旬达到为害盛期。江苏北部地区玉米、高粱遭地下害虫为害一般缺苗10％左右。从以上情况来看，虫情日趋紧张，经验证明，如疏忽防治就要减产10％以上或者更多。因而必须加强防治工作，坚决把病虫害消灭在初生阶段，已成为保证苗全、株壮，力争杂粮作物全面丰收的一项重要工作。通知就消灭病虫害，提出六点意见：
    一、加强领导，把杂粮病虫害防治工作列入夏季农业生产一项重要内容，制订防治计划，安排一定数量的防病灭虫劳力，保证防治工作不因夏季生产繁忙而被挤掉。
    二、消灭病虫害必须做到巧、准、狠。认真分析研究病虫情报，根据病虫发展情况，抓住有利时机，组织力量，采取人工、药械等综合方法，猛攻巧打，速战速决。在6月中、下旬应开展一次以消灭谷子苗期害虫和田间玉米螟的防治运动，东北地区应及时消灭网目砂潜（一种甲虫的名称），要求做到一块不漏一虫不放，保证不伤一苗。
    三、各地必须深入贯彻“洋土并举”的方针，既要经济合理使用化学药剂和器械，又要发动群众大搞土农药土器械。1958年经验证明，我国土农药资源丰富，潜力大，有些效果并不比化学药剂低。因此，各级农业部门要和其他有关部门密切协作，及早组织群众采集、制造土农药，改装、创造效率高的器械。
    四、夏收夏种已经到来，各地必须抓住这一季节，结合耕、种，施用毒土、毒谷消灭地下害虫，药剂拌种，栽插无病薯秧，并且建立无病良种留种地，有计划地繁育无病种薯，这是消灭甘薯黑斑病最经济有效的措施。
    五、拔除田间病株，彻底销毁病源。要求早拔、连续拔、彻底拔，销毁干净。
    六、及时总结防治经验，迅速推广。要鼓励大胆创造的革命精神，也要总结“多、快、好、省”巧治病虫的经验，把防治工作提高一步。
