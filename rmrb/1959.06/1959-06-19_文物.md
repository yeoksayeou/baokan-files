     Cultural Relics
    Historical Relics from Shanghai
    The Shanghai Museum recently selected seventy-nine pieces from its collection of historical relics and sent them to the China History Museum in Beijing, which is currently under construction.
    These fine pieces include many precious relics from the Western Zhou Dynasty, three thousand years ago. For example, the “Bu Yi Gui Cover,” one of the famous bronze vessels of the Western Zhou Dynasty, has a lengthy inscription about important historical events. Another example is the "Yu Ding," which is grand in shape and exquisite in workmanship. It is a standard vessel in terms of shape and pattern in the bronze craftsmanship of the early Western Zhou Dynasty. It has an inscription of two hundred and ninety-one characters, which is an important material for studying the social economy and political system of the Western Zhou Dynasty.
    This batch of cultural relics also includes the oldest existing measuring instrument, the “Zi He Zi Fu” from the Warring States period; the earliest and most famous silverware, the “Gan You Silver Cup” from the Warring States period; and the straw sandals and bamboo mats of the Chu State unearthed in Changsha during the Warring States period, as well as the "Qin Quan" engraved with the edict of Qin Shihuang unifying weights and measures.
    This is the second batch of cultural relics that the Shanghai Museum has supported fraternal units with this year. In February this year, the Shanghai Museum and the Shanghai Municipal Cultural Relics Management Committee and other units transported more than 30,000 cultural relics to the museums of eleven provinces and cities.
    Millennial Iron Buddha Discovered in Nanjing
    An iron Guanyin Buddha statue from the Tongguang era of the Later Tang Dynasty was recently discovered in the suburbs of Nanjing. This unearthed Buddha statue is fifty-nine centimeters high and weighs twenty kilograms. The Buddha statue is draped in gauze, with a Buddhist rosary around the waist and feet on a lotus throne. On the base is cast in Yang script the inscription "Made by the monks of the Ancient Buddha Temple on the ninth day of the twelfth month of the Tongguang year of the Great Tang Dynasty." The second year of Tongguang is 924 AD. Tongguang was the reign title of Emperor Zhuangzong of the Later Tang during the Five Dynasties. The Later Tang Dynasty lasted for a total of thirteen years (923 to 935 AD), but Zhuangzong only reigned for three years, so very few cultural relics have been handed down. This Buddha statue has now been handed over to the Municipal Cultural Relics Management Committee for preservation.
    Mobile Museum Exhibition
    The Shanghai Natural Museum Preparatory Office exhibited a portion of animal and plant specimens and pictures in the suburbs for the first time to publicize knowledge about agricultural and sideline production and the prevention and control of crop diseases and insect pests to farmers.
    The specimens and pictures exhibited at the Shanghai County Workers' Cultural Palace from the 16th include "How to Prevent and Control Sixteen Crop Diseases and Insect Pests" and "How to Raise Rabbits." These two groups of exhibits are closely integrated with the current prevention and control of diseases and insect pests of major crops such as rice and cotton and the development of poultry and livestock production by the people's communes in the suburbs of Shanghai. It is planned to exhibit in Shanghai County for a week and then move to nearby people's communes for mobile exhibitions. The Natural Museum Preparatory Office also sent special personnel to give detailed explanations.
    At the same time, the Shanghai Museum also selected two groups of pictures, "Inventions and Creations of the Ancient Working People" and "Revolutionary Historical Relics of Yan'an," for mobile exhibitions in the Xiaotang People's Commune and other places in Fengxian County in the suburbs.

    上海来的历史文物
    上海博物馆最近在所藏的历史文物中，精选七十九件送给正在筹建中的北京中国历史博物馆。
    这批精品中，包括有三千年前西周时代的许多珍贵文物。例如西周著名铜器之一的“不?簋盖”，上面刻有有关重大历史事件的长篇铭文。又如“盂鼎”，形制宏伟，制作精美，它是西周初期青铜工艺中形制和花纹的标准器，上面刻有二百九十一个字的铭文，是研究西周社会经济和政治制度的重要资料。
    这批文物中还有现存的最古量器，战国“子盉子釜”；最早而著名的银器，战国“甘游银杯”，和在长沙出土的战国时代楚国的草鞋和篾席，以及刻有秦始皇统一度量衡的诏书的“秦权”。
    这是上海博物馆今年第二批支援兄弟单位的文物。今年2月间，上海博物馆和上海市文物管理委员会等单位，曾运出三万多件文物，给了十一个省市的博物馆。
    南京发现千年铁佛
    南京市郊区最近发现了后唐同光年代的铁观音佛像一尊。这尊出土的佛像高五十九公分，重二十斤。佛像周身披纱，腰系佛珠，脚踏莲座。在底座上铸有“大唐同光年十二月九日古佛寺众僧造像一躯”的阳文款字。同光二年是公元924年。同光是五代时后唐庄宗的年号。后唐建国共十三年（公元923年至935年），庄宗在位仅三年，所以留传下来的文物很稀少。这尊佛像现已交市文管会保存。
    博物馆流动展览
    上海自然博物院筹备处第一次在郊区展出一部分动物植物标本和图片，向农民宣传有关农副业生产和防治农作物病虫害的知识。
    从16日开始在上海县工人文化宫展出的标本和图片，有“怎样防治农作物十六病虫害”和“怎样养兔”。这两组展品都同当前上海郊区人民公社防治水稻、棉花等主要农作物病虫害和发展家禽家畜的生产密切配合。计划在上海县展出一星期后，再到附近人民公社流动展出。自然博物院筹备处并派专人作详细讲解。
    与此同时，上海博物馆也挑选了“古代劳动人民的发明创造”和“延安革命历史文物”两组图片，在郊区奉贤县萧塘人民公社等地流动展出。（新华社）
