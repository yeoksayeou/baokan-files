Water Combat
By Our Correspondent Gao Changren

May 18th, although not the Dragon Boat Festival, the Xiangjiang River in Changsha was a hundred times more exciting than the dragon boat races.

In the morning, after a long rain, the sky cleared, and people on the riverside avenue of Changsha looked west. Before them, rows of unusual fleets were berthed on the banks of the Water Land. There were wooden sailing boats from Sichuan with fish-belly shapes; shallow-water tugboats made of cement, plastic, and plywood from Shanghai and Zhenjiang; large wooden barges from Guanghua County, Hubei, and light and flexible small wooden boats from Hunan. Regardless of the size of the boats, whether they were steamers or wooden sailing boats, the masts were all covered with colorful flags, and the hulls were covered with slogans. The crew members had decorated their ships beautifully. A few days ago, these different types of ships crossed the Yangtze River and Dongting Lake and arrived in Xiangjiang. The water heroes gathered in Changsha to exchange experiences in the reform of water transport tools over the past year.

At 2:00 p.m., the ship performance began. A light green tugboat, spewing thick smoke, took the lead and rushed out of the fleet, going against the current. It was moving so fast and smoothly that the representatives lined up on the shore sent a burst of warm applause. The ship being demonstrated was one of the achievements of the technical innovation of water transport workers in Jiangsu Province. The hull was made of cement and steel wire mesh. This saves steel and reduces weight, and it is not necessary to paint it or worry about corrosion. This year, Jiangsu Province will manufacture more than one hundred ships made of cement.

Following closely behind the cement boat were three new types of tugboats with hulls made of plywood and cement. These were designed and manufactured by shipbuilding workers in Shanghai and Jiangsu. These boats have light and strong hulls, and also have the advantage of being corrosion-resistant. People were concentrating on watching the new types of ships when, in a flash, two columns of fleets using "side pushing" and "corner pushing" were giving excellent performances. This is a new creation of the crew members of the Hunan Shipping Bureau. This creation is developed on the basis of the "pushing method." By adopting this method, resistance can be greatly reduced and speed increased. These two fleets, towing ten large wooden barges, were like water trains, and the wide water surface immediately appeared narrow. The cheers from the shore were even louder. After the performance of the motorized ships, there was the performance of excellent wooden sailing boat types. Under current conditions in our country, wooden sailing boats are a major means of transportation on inland rivers. They are large in number, widely distributed, and their total tonnage is equivalent to three times that of steamers. They are responsible for 60% to 70% of water transport tasks throughout the year. However, wooden sailing boats are slow and completely operated by hand. This important water transport tool has become a backward aspect of water transport. Under such circumstances, it is very important to vigorously carry out technical innovation and technical revolution of wooden sailing boats, and give full play to the transportation potential of wooden sailing boats.

Among these excellent ship types, the fish-belly boat from Sichuan took the lead and went downstream. It attracted the audience with its unique appearance. It turned out that this boat had two more bulged protective cages on the left and right sides of the hull than ordinary boats, just like the bulging belly of a fish. But don't underestimate it. With this improvement, its load capacity has increased by 55%. This ship type was designed by Feng Shunhe, an old technician in Leshan County, Sichuan Province. This creation has given people great inspiration in tapping loading potential.

After the fish-belly boat passed, the "four-in-one" boat from Hongjiang, Hunan followed. Compared with the original ship, this improved ship type has two-thirds less draft, but the speed is 69% faster, and it runs smoothly and safely. People were admiring the large and excellent ship types, when suddenly, teams of small wooden sailing boats came flying by. There are the Wujiangzi from Ningxiang County, Hunan Province, the Yunhu Biezi from Xiangtan County, and the Shangshan boat from Changsha County. Don't underestimate these small boats, they are a main force in short-distance transportation in small rivers and streams.

Finally, the motor sailing boats came, some of them towing several wooden barges. Those who controlled the machines were the boatmen who used to use poles and oars for heavy labor. At present, our country cannot equip all wooden sailing boats with machines, but for the average boatman, it should be a great encouragement and a beautiful direction to have motor sailing boats sailing on inland rivers!

After watching this wonderful performance, I cannot forget it for a long time. The impression it leaves on people is not just a wonderful performance. It tells people that this performance is also a glorious page in the history of the transformation of Chinese wooden sailing boats.

    水上比武
    本报记者　高长任
    5月18日，虽然不是端阳佳节，长沙的湘江水面上，却比龙舟竞渡精彩百倍。
    早晨，久雨初晴，人们在长沙市沿江大道，举目西望，眼前，一排排不寻常的船队，停泊在水陆洲边。这里有来自四川的鱼肚型木帆船；有从上海、镇江开来的水泥、塑料、胶合板制成的浅水拖轮；有湖北光化县的大木驳，也有轻巧灵活的湖南小木船。不论大船和小船，轮船或木帆船，桅杆都是挂满了彩旗，船身上贴满了标语，船员们把自己的船舶打扮得十分美丽。几天前，这些不同型号的船舶穿长江、跨洞庭，来到了湘江。水上英雄会师长沙，就是要把一年多水上运输工具改革的经验来一次交流。
    下午二时，船舶表演开始了。一艘浅绿色的拖轮，吐着浓烟，一马当先，冲出了船队，逆流而上，它行驶得是那么快速而又平稳，接着，排列在岸上的代表们，送来了一阵热烈的掌声。正在表演的这条船，是江苏省水上运输工人技术革新的成就之一，船身是用水泥和钢丝网制造的。这样，既节省了钢材减轻了重量，而且不用油漆也不怕腐蚀。这种用水泥作材料制成的船只，今年江苏省要制造一百多艘。
    紧跟在水泥船后边的，是用胶合板和水泥制成船身的三艘新型拖轮，这是由上海和江苏的造船工人们设计制造出来的，这种船船身既轻巧又坚固，同样有不怕腐蚀的优点。人们正在聚精会神地观看新型的船只，转瞬间两列用
  “边顶”和“角顶”的船队，正在进行出色的表演。这是湖南航运局船员们的新创造，这个创造是在“顶推法”的基础上发展起来的，采用这种方法以后，可以大大减少阻力，增加航速。这两个船队，拖带着十条大木驳，犹如水上列车，宽阔的水面立刻显得狭窄起来了。岸上的欢呼声也更高了。机动船表演过后，接着就是木帆船优良船型的表演。木帆船，在我国目前的条件下，是内河的一项主要运输工具。它数量大，分布广，总吨位相当于轮船的三倍；全年它要担负60％到70％的水运任务。但是木帆船航速慢，完全由人工操作，这种重要的水运工具，却成了水上运输的落后方面。在这样的情况下，大力开展木帆船的技术革新和技术革命，发挥木帆船的运输潜力，就是十分重要的一件事了。
    在这些优良的船型当中，四川的鱼肚船一马当先，顺流而下。它以独特的外表吸引了观众。原来这只船在左右两舷上，比普通船多装了两个鼓起来的护笼，正像鼓起来的鱼肚子一样。可是别小看它。这么一改进，它的载重量却增加了55％。这个船型是四川省乐山县老技工冯顺和设计的。这种创造，在挖掘装载潜力方面，给了人们很大的启发。
    鱼肚船走过以后，湖南洪江“四合一”船跟上来了。这只改进过的船型，比起原有的船只，吃水要浅三分之二，航速却快了69％，行驶起来平稳、安全。人们正在欣赏大型的优良船型，突然，一队队小型木帆船又飞驶过来，这里有湖南省宁乡县的乌江子、湘潭县的云湖别子、长沙县的上山船，别看轻这些小船，它在小河小溪中却是短途运输的一支主力。
    最后机帆船来了，有的还拖带几只木驳船。掌握机器的，就是过去拿篙拿橹进行繁重劳动的船工。目前我国还不能把所有的木帆船都用机器装备起来，但机帆船在内河中行驶对于一般船工来说，该是多么大的鼓舞，多么美好的方向啊！
    看了这次精彩的表演，使我久久不能忘怀。这里留给人们的印象：不仅仅是一场精彩的表演，它告诉人们：这次演出，在中国木帆船的改造史上也是光辉的一页。
