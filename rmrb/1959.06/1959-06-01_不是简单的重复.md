    Not a Simple Repetition
    Wang Pu
    After reading the news about the combination of administrative inspection and mass self-inspection in the Suzhou Motor Factory, I was reminded of a passage in the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" on dialectical and historical materialism: "Dialectics does not regard the process of development as a movement in a circle, not as a simple repetition of what has already occurred, but as a forward movement, an upward movement, a process of transition from an old qualitative state to a new qualitative state, from the simple to the complex, from the lower to the higher." Thinking about this passage in connection with the Suzhou Motor Factory's news, isn't the development process of the quality inspection system in many of our enterprises just like this?
    Before last year, quality inspection in enterprises was generally done by full-time personnel. At that time, in some enterprises, there were conflicts between quality inspectors and workers. Workers felt that quality inspectors were supervising them, picking on faults, and disregarding production progress. Inspectors were both busy and afraid of offending workers. Sometimes, when defective products were found and sent back for rework, it did indeed delay progress. During the Great Leap Forward last year, the workers' awareness improved, and they actively proposed to be responsible for inspecting the quality of their own semi-finished products. This inspection during the production process, the conscious inspection by the masses, compensated for the shortcomings of the past administrative inspections alone. It allowed for the early detection of problems in product quality, preventing defective products from being discovered at the end, requiring all to be reworked or scrapped, which wasted manpower and delayed progress. At the same time, this practice strengthened the workers' responsibility for product quality and played a positive role in ensuring product quality.
    However, some people at the time treated the mass self-inspection system one-sidedly, feeling that relying solely on mass self-inspection could guarantee product quality, and administrative inspection was no longer necessary. As a result, some factories abolished full-time inspection organizations and inspectors, and canceled the top-down administrative inspection system. This practice was of course inappropriate. Because there are hundreds or thousands of workers in an enterprise, and their political awareness and technical level cannot be the same. Even for one worker, there are times when they are in good spirits and times when they are in bad spirits, times when they are focused and times when they are tired. Obviously, relying solely on workers' self-inspection cannot completely guarantee quality. Especially when production is tight and tasks are heavy, workers are more likely to be careless and relax on quality. Therefore, the Party and economic leading organs have repeatedly emphasized recently that any enterprise that has abolished quality inspection organizations and quality inspection systems must immediately restore them.
    At this time, reading that passage in the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" is very beneficial. It can prevent moving from one extreme to another. If one does not look at the problem from this perspective, but understands the restoration of the administrative inspection system from a metaphysical point of view, regarding it as a simple repetition, then one will again lose the mass self-inspection and return to the old path of full-time inspectors dancing alone, and as a result, the task of ensuring product quality will still not be perfectly achieved. The correct approach should be like that of the Suzhou Motor Factory, which has both strict top-down finished product quality inspection and the masses' conscious self-inspection and mutual inspection. In this way, the quality of products can be reliably guaranteed, and the quality inspection system in the enterprise can truly progress and improve.
    Not only should we do this with quality inspection work, but also with any specific work in enterprise management. We should both inherit the experience of scientific management established in the past few years and fully absorb the experience of mass movements last year, so as to gradually explore a new type of management system suitable for our enterprises. Simple repetition cannot lead to progress.

    不是简单的重复
    王朴
    读了苏州电机厂行政检查同群众自己检查相结合的消息以后，想起了联共（布）党史里辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义一节中所说的一段话：“辩证法认为不应把发展过程了解为循环式的运动，不应把它了解为过去事物底简单重复，而应把它了解为前进的运动，上升的运动，由旧质态进到新质态，由简单发展到复杂，由低级发展到高级的过程。”把这段话同苏州电机厂的消息联系起来一想，我们许多企业里的质量检验制度的发展过程，不正是如此么？
    在去年以前，企业里的质量检验工作一般地都由专职人员来做。那时候，在有些企业里，质量检查员同工人有矛盾。工人觉得质量检查员是监督他们的，专挑毛病，不顾生产进度；检验人员既很忙碌，又怕得罪工人，有时检查出来废品次品，打回去返工，也确实耽误进度。去年在大跃进中，工人的觉悟提高了，纷纷提出自己也负责检查自己所生产的半成品的质量。这种在生产过程中的检查，群众自觉的检查，补救了过去单纯由行政检查的缺点，可以及早发现产品质量上的毛病，不致到最后发现废品次品，全部返工或报废，既浪费人力，又耽误进度。同时，这种做法加强了工人对产品质量的责任，更对保证产品质量起了积极的作用。
    但是，当时有些人片面的对待群众自检制度，觉得只靠群众自检就可以保证产品质量，行政检验已经不必要了，于是有些工厂便取消了专职的检验机构和检验人员，取消了自上而下的行政检验制度。这种做法当然是不妥当的。因为一个企业里有成百成千的工人，政治觉悟和技术水平不可能一样。即使一个工人，也有情绪好和情绪坏的时候，有精神集中和身体疲倦的时候。显然，只靠工人自己检查，是不能完全保证质量的。尤其是生产紧张、任务重的时候，工人们更容易疏忽大意，放松质量。因此，近来党和经济领导机关多次地强调提出：不论任何企业，凡是取消了质量检验机构和质量检验制度的，一定要立即恢复。
    在这时候，读一读联共（布）党史中的那一段话，就十分有好处了。它可以防止从一个片面走向另一个片面。如果不是用这样的观点来看问题，而是用形而上学的观点理解恢复行政检验制度，把这看做是一个简单的重复，那就又会丢掉群众的自检，回到过去专职检验人员跳光杆舞的老路上去，结果保证产品质量的任务还是不能完满地实现。正确的做法应该像苏州电机厂那样，既有严格的由上而下的成品质量检查，又有群众自觉的自我检查和互相检查。这样，产品的质量才能得到可靠的保证，企业里的质量检验制度才真正的有所进步，有所提高。
    不仅对待质量检验工作应该如此，对待企业管理工作中的任何一项具体工作都应该如此。都应该既继承过去几年建立起来的科学管理的经验，又充分吸收去年大搞群众运动的经验，从而逐步摸索出一套适合于我们企业的新型的管理制度来。简单地重复，是不能够进步的。
