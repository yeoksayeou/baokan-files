    “The Beauty of Manure" and So On
    Xí Gōng
    On March 17th, the eighth page of the People's Daily published a short article titled "Appreciation." The article mentioned a middle school teacher explaining the word "appreciation" to students, saying: "We can use 'appreciation' for things we like, such as flowers, films, plays, and all artworks, etc. But we cannot use this word for things we dislike, such as we cannot say we appreciate manure." Some students said the teacher was wrong. They said, "It (manure) can be used as fertilizer...painters paint it on canvas, photographers capture it in their lenses, and poets even write poems to sing about it, so can't we use 'appreciation'?" The teacher, after hearing this, deeply felt that he lacked "the profound feelings that farmers have" for fertilizer and sighed incessantly. On May 21st, according to the article "Occasional Thoughts on Reading Paintings" on the eighth page of the People's Daily, there were indeed paintings made with manure. Some depicted "a group of pigs defecating while people wait to collect it." The author of the article correctly criticized the painter's viewpoint.
    After reading the "beauty of manure" theory reflected in the two short articles, I wondered, did that middle school student, that middle school teacher, that fine arts worker who painted a group of pigs defecating while people wait to collect it, really feel that manure was beautiful and worthy of appreciation when they were in front of manure? I also thought, if we follow the aesthetic viewpoint that manure can be used as fertilizer, so it can be painted, written about, and sung about, then, by extension, manure and the like can also be brought onto the stage for "appreciation." And dung beetles, scorpions, centipedes, and other filthy, ferocious, and terrifying things that can be used as medicinal materials to maintain human health and beauty can also be painted, written about, and sung about. Will they bring beauty to people's lives and emotions, or what?
    The people who accumulate fertilizer and their labor are beautiful, and they can be written about, painted about, and sung about extensively. In early spring last year, I spread manure with the commune members. At that time, the weather was warm and sunny, men and women, each with a basket, slung diagonally over their shoulders, grabbed the manure with both hands, and evenly spread it on the newly sown wheat fields. Everyone's posture and movements were the same, one handful after another, one basket after another. We felt happy every time we spread a handful of manure, and every grain of manure was filled with our hope for a good harvest. At that time, I thought that this kind of labor was quite poetic and picturesque. Although the people here cherish manure very much, manure is still dirty and smelly in their eyes. Different classes have different aesthetic viewpoints on the same natural or social phenomena. But this does not mean that beauty is a subjective product that is divorced from objective existence. Beauty exists in objective things. Different classes hold different aesthetic viewpoints on the same thing only because some classes' aesthetic viewpoints truly reflect the beauty of objective things. Some are biased by class prejudice and distort the beauty of objective things, seeing the ugly as beautiful and the beautiful as ugly, especially regarding social phenomena. For example, the bourgeoisie considers various kinds of labor, such as accumulating fertilizer, and the people engaged in various kinds of labor as ugly, while the proletariat considers them as beautiful. Here, as with other things, the class viewpoint in proletarian aesthetics is completely unified with the objectivity of beauty.
    I digress. Let's talk about those farmers spreading manure! Because manure is dirty and smelly, although manure is right in front of their eyes, right in their hands, they do not appreciate the manure. They also do not want to be praised alongside manure in poems, movies, and paintings. And that painting of "a group of pigs defecating while people wait to collect it," although I haven't seen it, I can imagine that the painting equates the pigs curling their tails to defecate with people and people's labor. It is even possible that the focus of the painting is concentrated on the pigs defecating. I believe that equating the most important and essential things in our lives with secondary and meaningless (in terms of thought) things is not the requirement of realism for "truth," but is closer to the so-called "truth" of naturalism. Aesthetics is an important part of socialist and communist education. People in communist society will be able to live according to the laws of beauty to a greater extent. Lu Xun once called fine arts "the phenomenon of the soul of the nation." Therefore, since views such as "the beauty of manure" have appeared in middle school students and middle school teachers, and in fine arts creation, it is worthy of attention.

### “粪美”等等

    “粪美”等等
    习工
    3月17日，人民日报八版刊一短文，题为“欣赏”。文中说到一位中学教员给学生解释“欣赏”这个词，向学生说：对喜闻乐见的事物，可以用欣赏，比如花、影剧、一切艺术品等等。但对厌恶的事物就不能用这个词。如不能说欣赏大粪。有的学生说老师讲的不对。曰：“它（大粪）可以作肥料……，画家们把它画上画布，摄影师把它摄入镜头，诗人们还作诗歌唱它，难道不能用欣赏？”那教师听了，深感自己对肥料缺乏“农民那样的深厚感情”而感叹不止。5月21日，据人民日报八版“读画偶感”一文所说，果然有以粪作画的。有的画着“群猪正在屙粪，人在候接”。文章作者正确地批评了画家的观点。
    看了两篇短文中所反映的“粪美”论，我在想，那中学生，那中学教师，那画群猪屙粪人在候接的美术工作者，真的曾在大粪面前，感到大粪很美丽而有欣赏之情吗？我又想，如果按着粪可作肥就可作画、作诗和歌唱的美学观点，推而广之，粪之类也可以搬上舞台“欣赏”了。而屎克郎、蝎子、蜈蚣等，这些可作药材维护人体健美的肮脏、凶恶、恐怖的东西，也可以作画、作诗和歌唱了。它们将给人们的生活和感情带来的是美呢？还是什么呢？
    积肥的人及其劳动是美的，是可以大书大画大唱的。去年初春，我和社员们一起撒大粪。那时，天和日暖，男男女女，一人一筐，斜挂肩头，双手抓起大粪，均匀地撒向刚播种的麦田。大家的姿态动作都一样，一把接着一把，一筐接着一筐，每撒一把粪我们都感到高兴，每一粒大粪都饱含着我们丰收的希望。那时我就想，人们这种劳动，也颇有诗情画意。这里的人们，虽然很珍惜粪，但粪在他们的眼前，也是脏的，是臭的。不同的阶级对同样的自然现象或社会现象，有不同的美学观点。但这绝不是说美是离开客观存在的唯心的产物，美存在于客观事物之中。各个阶级对同一事物抱不同的美学观点，只是反映了有的阶级的美学观点真正反映了客观事物的美。有的是受阶级的偏见，歪曲了客观事物的美。把丑的看成是美的，把美的看成是丑的，尤其对社会现象是如此。如像积肥等各种劳动和从事各种劳动的人，资产阶级认为是丑的，无产阶级认为是美。在这里，也如对其它事物一样，无产阶级美学中的阶级观点和美的客观性是完全统一的。
    话说远了，再说那些撒粪的农民吧！因为粪是脏的，是臭的，所以，大粪虽然就在他们的眼前，就在他们的手里，可是他们并不欣赏那大粪。他们也不希望在诗歌里、电影里和画布上，把他们和粪平列在一起来赞颂。而那张“群猪屙粪人在候接”的画，我虽然还没有见到，但可以想见，那画把群猪卷起尾巴屙屎同人和人的劳动平列起来了，甚至那画的焦点可能集中到了群猪屙屎了。我认为，把我们生活里最主要的本质的东西和次要的无意义的（在思想上）东西平列起来，这并不是现实主义对于“真实”的要求，反而和自然主义的所谓“真实”相接近。美学是社会主义和共产主义教育的重要内容之一。共产主义社会的人们，将有可能更大限度地按着美的法则生活。鲁迅曾把美术称为“国魂之现象”。所以，既然在中学生和中学教师中，在美术创作中，出现了“粪美”之类的观点，那就值得注意了。
