One afternoon, Wang Rong, the Young Pioneer instructor at Beijing Fresh Hutong Elementary School, gave five movie tickets for "The Shepherd Boy Joins the Army" to Wei Hua and four other Young Pioneers who excelled in their studies. After class, Wei Hua and her classmates walked towards the cinema, chatting and laughing, but the closer they got, the more uneasy she felt.

It turned out that they had a Chinese language test the next day. Although Wei Hua had already reviewed her own work, had her classmate Gao Jie reviewed well? Gao Jie was a boy who often got only two or three points on tests because he was too fond of playing and didn't like to review his lessons. Seeing that they were not far from the cinema, should she go back to help Gao Jie review his Chinese lesson? Or should she go to the movies? Gao Jie must need everyone's help now, but she was going to the movies. Was this the behavior of a Young Pioneer? Wei Hua stopped and told her companions what was on her mind, and then turned back to find Gao Jie.

Wei Hua found Gao Jie and took him to her home, where she repeatedly reviewed the Chinese textbook with him. She asked Gao Jie to recite the texts and write the new words from memory. When Gao Jie recited or wrote incorrectly, Wei Hua made him look at the textbook, and then recite and write again until Gao Jie mastered them all.

The next day, Gao Jie got four points on his Chinese test, which was a great joy for him! And Wei Hua felt even sweeter in her heart; she felt happier than watching a movie!

    帮助同学复习功课
    一天下午，北京新鲜胡同小学少年先锋队辅导员王荣，把五张“牧童投军”的电影票交给了魏华等五个学习好的少先队员。下课后，魏华和同学们一起有说有笑地往电影院走，可是越往前走，她心里越感到不放心。
    原来，第二天要测验语文，魏华自己虽然早复习好了，可是同班同学高杰复习好了吗？高杰这个男孩子，因为平时太贪玩，不爱温习功课，考试常常得三分、二分。眼看离电影院不远了，是回去帮助高杰复习语文课呢？还是去看电影？高杰现在一定很需要大家帮助，可是自己却看电影去了，这是少先队员的行为吗？魏华站住不走了，她把自己的心事和同伴说了一下，就一个人回头找高杰去了。
    魏华把高杰找到自己家里，拿出语文课本一遍一遍地给他进行复习。她叫高杰背课文、默生字，高杰背得不对、默得不对时，魏华又要他看课文，然后再背、再默，直到高杰都会了为止。
    第二天，高杰的语文测验得了四分，这在高杰来讲是多大的喜事啊！而魏华心里更是甜滋滋的，她感到比看一场电影还快活！
