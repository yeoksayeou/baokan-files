    Printing and Proofreading Work Should Improve Quality
    Recently, in order to meet the learning needs of all parties, various books have been published in large quantities. This is a great event. However, under this large amount of publishing, some shortcomings in our publishing work have also been exposed, the prominent manifestation of which is that there are many errors in printing and proofreading. For example, when you buy a new book now, it often comes with an errata sheet, correcting a few places, as many as dozens. Readers have to make corrections after buying a book, which adds a lot of trouble. At the same time, a small piece of paper is not easy to detect, and if it is accidentally lost, the errors cannot be corrected, which brings adverse effects to readers. Also, some newspapers and magazines often have typos and omissions due to careless proofreading.
    I hope that comrades in the publishing department will strengthen their sense of responsibility, improve the quality of proofreading and printing, and gradually reduce and eliminate errors.

    排印和校对工作应当提高质量
    最近，为了满足各方面的学习需要，各种书籍源源不断地大量出版。这是一件大喜事。但是，在这大量出版的情况下，也暴露了我们出版工作中的一些缺点，突出的表现是排印和校对中的差错不少。如现在买一本新书，常常夹有勘误表，更正的地方少的几处，多达几十处。读者买来一本书先要进行一番更正，增添不少麻烦。同时，一张小纸条也不易发觉，一不小心丢失了，错误之处就得不到更正，这又给读者带来了不良影响。还有些书报杂志由于校对工作马虎，也时常出现错字漏字。
    我希望出版部门的同志加强工作责任感，提高校对排印质量，逐步减少和消灭差错。
