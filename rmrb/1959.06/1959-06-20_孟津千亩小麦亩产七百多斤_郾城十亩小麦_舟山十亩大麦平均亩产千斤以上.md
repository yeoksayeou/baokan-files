Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 19th: The first wheat high-yield area of the Baihe Brigade of the Baihe Commune in Mengjin County, Henan Province, consisting of 1,036 mu of wheat, has been harvested, threshed, dried, and cleaned, achieving an average yield of 717 jin per mu. Among them, 536 mu achieved an average yield of 861 jin per mu. The 21.5 mu of experimental plots cultivated by Xu Ming, director of the County Women's Federation, and others, achieved an average yield of 1,517 jin per mu.

All the wheat fields in this high-yield area were deeply ploughed more than 1.2 chi using a double-plough method before sowing. The 536 mu of high-yield fields and the experimental fields cultivated by cadres were ploughed even deeper. Combined with deep ploughing, an average of more than 20 carts of base fertilizer were applied per mu. "Bima No. 1," "Baiyupi," and "Bima No. 4" superior varieties were used, and reasonable close planting was universally implemented. All the wheat fields in the high-yield area were also terraced for self-flowing irrigation. Throughout the entire management period, "five irrigations and four fertilizations" were carried out. Weeding and hoeing were also done better than in previous years. In field management, special attention was paid to eliminating third-class seedlings, and quick-acting fertilizer was heavily applied using the method of "attacking with water and fertilizer simultaneously, and weeding with tilling," so that all the wheat in the high-yield area became first-class seedlings.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 19th: A plot of 11.4 mu of sweet potato stubble wheat in the Kongzhongguo Brigade of the Kongzhongguo People's Commune in Yancheng County, Henan Province, achieved a high yield. After threshing, drying, and cleaning, the average yield was 1,043.9 jin per mu.

This sweet potato stubble wheat was all deeply ploughed more than 1.2 chi. Combined with deep ploughing, about 200 dan of base fertilizer were applied per mu. Nanda 2419 superior variety was sown, with a sowing rate of 30 jin per mu. After sowing, ridges and furrows were cultivated. This high-yield field was cultivated by the youth team. A total of five irrigations and nine fertilizations were carried out to ensure the growth needs of wheat during the greening, jointing, booting, and filling stages, and to prevent lodging.

Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 19th: The 10.18 mu of high-yield barley field in the Lujiazhi Production Team of the Shenjiamen Commune in Zhoushan County, Zhejiang Province, after harvesting, drying, cleaning, and actual weighing and acceptance bag by bag and basket by basket, yielded a total of 10,603 jin of barley, with an average yield of 1,041.5 jin per mu.

Lujiazhi is a small island in the Zhoushan Islands. The land on the island is barren, and fishing has always been the main production. This year's bumper harvest of barley is a victory for the policy of achieving a double harvest of fish and grain and striving for food self-sufficiency on the islands. It is the result of fully implementing the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture. (Photo attached)

    孟津千亩小麦亩产七百多斤
    郾城十亩小麦　舟山十亩大麦平均亩产千斤以上
    据新华社郑州19日电　河南孟津县白合公社白合大队第一小麦丰产区一千零三十六亩小麦，经过实收实打，晒干扬净，平均每亩产量达到七百一十七斤。其中有五百三十六亩平均亩产八百六十一斤。县妇联会主任徐明等种的二十一亩五分试验田，平均亩产一千五百一十七斤。
    这个丰产区的全部麦田在播种前都用套犁法，深耕一尺二寸以上，其中五百三十六亩高产田和干部种的试验田，耕得更深一些；结合深翻，平均每亩施底肥二十车以上；全部采用“碧蚂一号”、“白玉皮”、“碧蚂四号”良种，普遍实行了合理密植。全丰产区的麦田，还实现了畦田化，能够自流灌溉。在整个管理期中，做到了“五水四肥”。中耕锄草也比往年做的好。在田间管理中特别注意了消灭三类苗，以“水肥一齐攻，拔草带中耕”的办法，大施速效肥，使丰产区的全部小麦都成了一类苗。
    据新华社郑州19日电　河南省郾城县空冢郭人民公社空冢郭大队一块十一亩四分红薯茬小麦，获得高额丰产。经脱粒后晒干扬净，平均亩产一千零四十三斤九两。
    这块红薯茬小麦，全部深翻一尺二寸以上；结合深翻，每亩施底肥二百担左右；并全部播种了南大二四一九良种，每亩下种量三十斤；种后又培垅打畦。这块丰产田由青年队负责培育。先后共浇水五次，施肥九次，保证了小麦在返青、拔节、孕穗、灌浆等时期生长的需要，并防止了倒伏。
    据新华社杭州19日电　浙江舟山县沈家门公社鲁家峙生产队的十亩一分八厘丰产畈大麦，收割后经过晒干扬净和逐袋逐箩实称验收，共收大麦一万零六百零三斤，平均亩产一千零四十一斤半。
    鲁家峙是舟山群岛一个小岛。全岛土地贫瘠，一向以渔业生产为主。今年获得大麦的大丰收，是实行渔粮双丰收、争取海岛粮食自给方针的胜利，是全面贯彻执行农业八字宪法的结果。（附图片）
