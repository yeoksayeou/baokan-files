　　River Lights
　　Wu Yanhen

The raging wind whips up rolling black clouds, the black clouds carry rain and command the sound of the wind, chasing the torrential flood pouring down for thousands of miles on this summer night. Nature unleashes its violence, the mighty Yellow River roars and surges; who is guarding the riverbank? Who is holding up the battle's bright lamp? Look at those lights, the more they are battered by wind and rain, the brighter they become! Tearing through the pitch-black night, a city of lights stands for thousands of miles along the riverbank. Those bright lights are the vigilant eyes of the observers! Not blinking an eye in the wind and rain, monitoring the water situation on the raging waves. The measuring rods standing tall in the water are like steel pillars firmly nailed into the heart of the waves! Thousands of measuring rods are connected in a line, setting up a battle array for thousands of miles along the riverbank. Our hydrological reconnaissance soldiers, a heart beating for thousands of miles along the riverbank, a heart dwelling on the motherland, dwelling on the motherland's villages and towns. The measuring rods are the future navigational markers, guiding ships to sail on the reservoir! The raging waves are about to generate electricity, the riverbank for thousands of miles is a city of lights!

    河上灯火
    吴烟痕狂风卷起滚滚乌云，乌云挟雨又驾驭风声，在这夏天的深夜，追赶着一泻万里的洪汛。大自然施开它的暴力，万里黄河呵狂哮奔腾；是谁镇守在河边？是谁高举战斗的明灯？你看那一盏盏灯火，风吹雨打它越发光明！撕破了漆黑的深夜，万里河边立起万里灯城。那明亮的灯火呵，是观测员警惕的眼睛！风雨里不眨一眼，狂涛怒浪上监视水情。挺立在水中的标尺，如钢柱牢牢地钉在涛心！千万标尺连成一线，万里河边摆开了万里战阵。我们的水文侦察兵，万里河边跳动一颗心，心上居住着祖国，居住着祖国的乡村和城镇。标尺是未来的航标，指引轮船在水库上航行！怒涛将要卷起电流，万里河边是万里灯城！
