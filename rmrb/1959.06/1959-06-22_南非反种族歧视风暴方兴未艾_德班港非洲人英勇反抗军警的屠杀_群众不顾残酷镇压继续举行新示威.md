Xinhua News Agency, Durban, 20th: Africans in Durban, South Africa, held new demonstrations on the 19th to resist racial discrimination and persecution.

On the morning of that day, hundreds of Africans, regardless of the brutal suppression by the police, held new demonstrations in the city to resist the racial discrimination policies of the white government authorities. A large number of armed police used water cannons and tear gas to disperse the demonstrators. In the Lamontville area in the suburbs, about a thousand Africans also held similar demonstrations that day. It is reported that the police arrested dozens of African women on this day.

According to earlier reports, after tens of thousands of people participated in a large demonstration in Durban on the 18th, a large number of armed military police continued to carry out bloody massacres of African residents overnight. They opened fire on thousands of unarmed Africans. Durban was in a state of combat almost all night. It is reported that the African resistance lasted all night, and they once surrounded a police station. On that day, the demonstration struggle rapidly spread from the Cato Manor area to the neighboring Chesterville area.

On the 19th, the police imposed a curfew in the African area, checkpoints were set up on major traffic routes, and a large number of police armed with automatic weapons patrolled all day. In addition, three armored vehicles equipped with machine guns were en route to Durban.

At the same time, the South African government is also stepping up the persecution of the leaders of the African National Congress. On the 19th, it banned Nokwe, the secretary-general of the organization, from speaking at gatherings for five years. Prior to this, the South African government had already issued similar bans on Luthuli, the chairman of the African National Congress, and Tambo, the vice-chairman.

The British "Manchester Guardian" published an editorial on the 19th acknowledging that the ban on Africans brewing alcohol was only the fuse for this demonstration, and the main reason was the widespread dissatisfaction of Africans with the white government's racial discrimination policies. It said, "There are so many things in the lives of Africans [in South Africa] that cause widespread dissatisfaction that a small thing can often ignite a very destructive wildfire like a spark falling on hay."

According to reports from London, the British government is very concerned that the large-scale anti-racial discrimination demonstrations by Africans in South Africa will affect its colonies in Central and East Africa.

Another report said that on the 19th, the shares of South African gold mines in the Brussels Stock Exchange in Belgium fell by 5% due to the large-scale demonstrations by Africans in Durban.

Xinhua News Agency, 21st: Durban News: Although the white government of the South African Federation has brutally suppressed the demonstrations by Africans in Durban, the situation there is still very tense.

On the 20th, Africans in the Lamontville area (African residential area) held demonstrations against racial discrimination again. New police reinforcements rushed to the area to strengthen the suppression of Africans. A police jeep crashed en route to a possible trouble spot in a panic, killing and injuring two or three policemen.

A curfew has been imposed in the African areas of Durban since the 18th. The police have placed sentries in front of every African beer hall. Armored vehicles patrol the streets all day, and a large number of police forces are on alert, ready to suppress Africans at any time. It is reported that the South African Air Force has handed over reconnaissance planes to the Durban police for use, and naval searchlights are also used to illuminate the Cato Manor area, where the large-scale demonstration broke out on the 18th, at night.

On the 20th, the Durban Magistrate's Court tried fifty-one African women on the "crime" of "public riot" in order to further persecute them.

Xinhua News Agency, 21st: London News: The African Organizations Committee in London issued a statement on the 19th regarding the large-scale anti-racial persecution demonstration by 40,000 Africans in Durban, South Africa, emphasizing that the struggle of the South African people "is part of the movement of hundreds of millions of people."

    南非反种族歧视风暴方兴未艾
    德班港非洲人英勇反抗军警的屠杀
    群众不顾残酷镇压继续举行新示威
    新华社20日讯　德班消息：南非德班港的非洲人，19日举行了新的反抗种族歧视和迫害的示威。
    当天上午，有数百名非洲人不顾警察的残暴镇压，在这个城市举行了新的反抗白人政府当局种族歧视政策的示威。大批武装警察用水龙头和催泪弹驱散示威群众。在城郊的拉蒙特维尔地方，当天也有约一千名非洲人举行了同样的示威。有消息说，这一天，警察逮捕了几十名非洲妇女。
    据早些时候的消息说，德班在18日发生了有数万人参加的大示威以后，大批武装军警连夜继续对非洲居民进行血腥屠杀。他们对成千的手无寸铁的非洲人开枪。德班几乎整夜都处在战斗状态中。据报道，非洲人的反抗进行了一夜，他们一度包围了一个警察局。当天，示威斗争曾经迅速由卡托马诺尔区蔓延到邻近的彻斯特维尔区。
    19日，警察在非洲人地区实行了戒严，各交通要道布置了岗哨，大批拿着自动武器的警察整天在巡逻。另外，有三辆配有机关炮的装甲车正在开往德班途中。
    同时，南非政府也在加紧迫害非洲人国民大会的领导人。它在19日又禁止这个组织的秘书长诺克韦五年内在集会上发表演说。在此以前，南非政府已经对非洲人国民大会主席卢图利和副主席坦博发布了同样的禁令。
    英国“曼彻斯特卫报”19日发表的社论承认，禁止非洲人酿酒只是这次示威的导火线，主要原因是非洲人普遍对白人政府种族歧视政策的不满。它说，“在（南非）非洲人的生活中有这样多的事情引起普遍的不满，以至一件小的事情常常可能像落在干草上的一粒火星一样，燃起破坏性很大的熊熊野火。”
    据来自伦敦的消息说，英国政府非常担心南非非洲人的反种族歧视大示威会影响到它在中非和东非的殖民地。
    另有消息说，19日在比利时布鲁塞尔的交易所中，由于德班非洲人的大示威，那里南非金矿的股票下跌了5％。
    新华社21日讯　德班消息：虽然南非联邦白人政府对德班非洲人的示威进行了残暴的镇压，但是，那里的局势仍然很紧张。
    20日，在拉蒙特维尔区（非洲人居住区）又有非洲人举行了反对种族歧视的示威。新的警察增援部队赶忙开向这个地区，以便加强对非洲人的镇压。有一辆警察的吉普车在慌慌张张地赶往可能出事的地点的时候，在途中翻车，死伤了两三个警察。
    从18日以来，德班的非洲人地区实行了戒严。警察在每一家非洲人啤酒店门前放了岗哨。装甲车整天在大街上来回巡逻，大批警察部队处于戒备状态，准备随时对非洲人进行镇压。据报道，南非联邦空军把侦察机交给了德班的警察使用，海军的探照灯也用来在夜间在18日爆发大示威的卡托马诺尔区照射。
    20日，德班地方法院以“公开暴乱”的“罪名”审讯五十一名非洲妇女，以便进一步加以迫害。
    新华社21日讯　伦敦消息：在伦敦的非洲组织委员会19日就南非德班港四万非洲人的反种族迫害大示威发表声明，强调南非人民的斗争“是亿万人民运动的一部分”。
