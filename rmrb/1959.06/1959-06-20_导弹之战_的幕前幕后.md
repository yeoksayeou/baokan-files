    Behind the Scenes of the "Missile War"
    Zhang Zhenya

    Not long ago, some American newspapers spread a sensational piece of news: "The United States Department of Defense has formulated a 'master plan' to prevent sudden air attacks, which will be submitted to Congress in June." It is said that this plan is to meet the entire air defense needs of the United States within three or four years with rockets, aircraft, radar stations, air defense networks, etc., costing more than three or four hundred billion US dollars.

    This costly plan is indeed good material for inciting war hysteria, but what spoils the fun is that the war incitement propaganda has just begun, and it has been immediately submerged by the fierce infighting among the three branches of the Pentagon over missiles.

    It turns out that the ground-to-air missiles used by the United States for air defense are mainly of two types: the Army's "Nike-Hercules" and the Air Force's "Bomarc." The former has a range of eighty miles (130 kilometers) and is an air defense missile that the Army is already using. The latter, according to the Air Force, boasts a range of over two hundred miles, but its performance remains to be verified and cannot be officially used yet. Whose missile should occupy a major position in the new air defense plan has become a battle of "I won't yield" between the Air Force and the Army.

    The Air Force, which is redder than red, was the first to launch the attack. It described the "Nike-Hercules" missile, on which the Army had already spent $3.7 billion, as worthless: not only is its performance poor, its hit rate low, and its technical structure outdated, but it is also said that when carrying a nuclear warhead, this type of air defense missile, due to its short range, often ends up destroying the cities it is supposed to protect.

    A weapon named for air defense, but will destroy itself, that won't do! So, after hearing the Air Force's "slander," Army Chief of Staff General Taylor jumped up in anger and launched a full counterattack. After giving the "Nike-Hercules" missile a good boast, he retorted against the Air Force's "Bomarc" missile, saying that its trial production was four years behind schedule, and after spending $1.9 billion, it still cannot be used, which shows that its performance is doubtful. Obviously, General Taylor's counterattack was very powerful. No matter how bad the Army's missiles are, they are already in use, while the Air Force's missiles, no matter how beautifully you describe them, are still in the realm of fantasy. The Air Force's stance on "pragmatism" is not strong.

    Since it concerns major national defense plans, how can we be careless? Defense Secretary McElroy stood up and ordered the organization of a special committee composed of thirty experts to investigate and judge whose missile is "genuine." But this is like adding fuel to the fire. Air Force Chief of Staff Twining, who came from the Air Force, and Air Force Chief of Staff White immediately organized a united front to deal with the Army. But the Army's stance was also very tough. The Navy, because it is fighting with the Air Force for jurisdiction over the "Polaris" missile submarine, stood on the Army's side against the adoption of the "Bomarc" missile. Both sides lined up and wrote written reports; the former advocated continuing to invest heavily in the "Bomarc" missile, while the latter firmly opposed it.

    Seeing that the quarrel was about to get out of control, for the sake of national defense "prestige," the Department of Defense simply adopted a policy of appeasement and made peace the most important thing. On the 23rd of last month, it issued a special statement guaranteeing that the "new air defense plan" would adopt both the Army's "Nike-Hercules" missile and the Air Force's "Bomarc" missile. President Eisenhower also personally came forward and made the same guarantee to stabilize "military morale." That is to say, everyone is happy. However, the annoying flames of the "missile dispute" not only burned bigger and bigger within the Department of Defense, but also spread to Congress. Here, too, opposing sides appeared. The Senate Armed Services Committee sharply cut three-quarters of the Army's funding for building "Nike-Hercules" missile bases; but then the House of Representatives fully approved the Army's funding for developing the "Nike-Hercules" missile, and sharply cut $162.7 million from the Air Force's funding for developing the "Bomarc" missile. As a result, the Army Chief of Staff violently attacked the Senate Armed Services Committee for conspiring with the Air Force against the Army. And the Air Force attacked the House Appropriations Committee for sincerely helping the Army make things difficult for the Air Force.

    In order to quell the dispute, the US President and the Secretary of Defense hurriedly issued a new decision on the 12th of this month. This time, it was the opposite of the previous approach: both the funding for the "Bomarc" and the "Nike-Hercules" (missiles) were to be cut, and the dollars saved would be used to develop the Army's "Nike-Zeus" anti-missile missile. The reason is that the first two types of missiles for defending aircraft have suddenly been found to be outdated. However, the contradiction is that not long ago, the Secretary of Defense believed that the "Nike-Zeus" anti-missile missile design was not advanced, and that trial production of this missile was equivalent to wasting national funds.

    The reader may be wondering, what's going on with this smoky mess? Wait a minute, there is a very dirty behind-the-scenes struggle here. Although the three armed forces are reluctant to lift this curtain, it is already an open secret. It turns out that behind the three armed forces and the members of the two houses are some aircraft and missile manufacturing companies that contract for the Department of Defense's missile orders. The "Bomarc" missile is contracted to the famous Boeing Aircraft Company, the "Nike-Hercules" missile is contracted to Western Electric Company, and the "Nike-Zeus" missile is contracted to Chrysler and Douglas. For several years, these large companies have been fighting for missile orders through their agents in the three armed forces, thereby influencing the military decision-making of the US Department of Defense. This time, for their respective interests, they not only stirred up trouble within the Pentagon, but also increased pressure on members of Congress. Boeing Aircraft Company, which contracted for the "Bomarc" missile, even came up with the idea of publishing large advertisements in newspapers during the most intense period of the dispute, listing the names of more than 8,000 large and small manufacturers related to the manufacture of this missile in order to strengthen its momentum. As a result, it has created what Lieutenant General Gavin, who recently retired from the Department of Defense, had already said: "The pressure of big business forces the government to decide to manufacture outdated weapons systems."

    Recently, because these companies have gone too far, the American public has complained a lot, and the US Congress has had to pretend to appoint a committee led by Democratic Congressman Edward Hebert to investigate the list of people who had held leadership positions in the Pentagon and are now employed by large aircraft companies. But if one believes that such an "investigation" will expose the actual situation behind the three armed forces' struggle in front of the public, it is obviously too naive. Even the "New York Herald Tribune" believes that this is just scratching the surface.

### “导弹之战”的幕前幕后

    “导弹之战”的幕前幕后
    张振亚
    前不久，美国一些报纸传出这样一条耸人听闻的消息：“美国国防部已经制订好防止空中突然袭击的‘总计划’，6月份就将提交国会。”据说，这个计划是要在三、四年内，用火箭、飞机、雷达站、防空网等等来满足美国整个防空需要，耗费将达三、四百亿美元以上。
    这个耗费巨大的计划，确是煽动战争歇斯底里的好材料，但煞风景的是，战争煽动宣传刚起，就立即被五角大楼三军之间争夺导弹的剧烈争吵所淹没。
    原来，美国用以防空的地对空导弹主要有两种：陆军的“奈克—赫尔克里士式”和空军的“鲍马克式”。前者射程八十英里（一三○公里），是陆军已经在使用的一种防空导弹。后者据空军吹嘘说射程可超过二百英里，但它的性能尚待证实，还不能正式使用。谁的导弹应该在新防空计划中占主要地位，就成了空军和陆军的一场“当仁不让”的斗争。
    首先发动进攻的是红得发紫的空军。它把陆军已在其上花用了三十七亿美元的“奈克—赫尔克里士式”导弹，竟说得一文不值：不但性能差、命中率低、技术结构过时，而且据说在携带核弹头的时候，这种防空导弹，由于射程过短，常常在弄得不好的情况下，会毁掉它所要保护的城市。
    名为防空武器，却会毁掉自己，这还得了！于是陆军参谋长泰勒将军在听了空军这种“诬蔑”以后，气得跳了起来，实行全力反攻。他先替“奈克—赫尔克里士式”导弹着实大吹一番以后，就对空军的“鲍马克式”导弹反唇相讥，说这种导弹试制工作比计划落后了四年之久，而且花了十九亿美元，至今还不能使用，可见它的性能是值得怀疑的。显然，泰勒将军的反击十分有力。陆军的导弹不管怎样不行，但已使用，而空军的导弹凭你说得天花乱坠，还在虚无飘渺之中。空军在“实用主义”方面，立脚是不硬的。
    事关国防大计，怎能马虎。国防部长麦克耳罗伊站了出来，下令组织一个由三十位专家组成的专门委员会来调查和评断究竟是谁的导弹“货真价实”。但这样一来，有如火上加油。空军出身的参谋长联席会议主席特文宁和空军参谋长怀特立即组织了联合阵线，来对付陆军。但是陆军阵势也很挺硬。海军因为正在同空军争夺“北极星式”导弹潜水艇的管辖权，所以它站在陆军方面反对采用“鲍马克式”导弹。双方摆开阵势，各自写了书面报告；前一派主张对“鲍马克式”导弹继续进行大量投资，后者则坚决加以反对。
    眼看争吵将一发而不可收拾，为了国防“威信”，国防部索性来个息事宁人，和为上计。它在上月23日特发表声明，保证“新防空计划”既采用陆军的“奈克—赫尔克里士式”导弹，又采用空军的“鲍马克式”导弹。艾森豪威尔总统也亲自出马，作了同样的保证，以稳定“军心”。这就是说，来个“皆大欢喜”。然而，恼人的“导弹之争”的火焰，不仅在国防部内越烧越大，而且蔓延到了国会。在这里，也出现了对立面。参议院军备委员会狠狠地把陆军建造“奈克—赫尔克里士式”导弹基地经费猛削了四分之三；可是接着众议院却全部批准陆军发展“奈克—赫尔克里士式”导弹的经费，而把空军发展“鲍马克式”导弹的经费猛削了一亿六千二百七十万美元。于是，陆军参谋长猛烈攻击参院军备委员会同空军同谋反对陆军。而空军则攻击众院拨款委员会诚心帮助陆军同空军作难。
    为了平息纷争，美国总统和国防部长又连忙在本月12日发表了新决定。这次是一反前次的作法：既要削减“鲍马克式”又要削减“奈克—赫尔克里士式”（导弹）的经费，而以节省下来的美元发展陆军的“奈克—宙斯式”反导弹导弹。理由是前两种防卫飞机的导弹已突然发现为过时。不过，矛盾的是不久前国防部长还认为“奈克—宙斯式”反导弹导弹设计不先进，试制这种导弹等于是在浪费国帑。
    看官也许奇怪，怎么搞的这样乌烟瘴气。且慢，这里有十分龌龊的幕后斗争。三军虽然都不愿揭开这个帷幕，然而，它却早已是公开秘密。原来，站在三军和两院议员背后的是包办了国防部导弹订货的一些飞机和导弹制造公司。承制“鲍马克式”导弹的是大名鼎鼎的波因飞机公司，承制“奈克—赫尔克里士式”导弹的是西方电气公司，承制“奈克—宙斯式”导弹的则是克莱斯勒公司和道格拉斯公司。几年来，这些大公司通过它们在三军的代理人，争夺导弹订货，从而左右着美国国防部的军事决策。这次它们为了各自的利益，不仅在五角大楼内煽风点火，而且加强对国会议员的压力。承制“鲍马克式”导弹的波因飞机公司还异想天开地在争闹最激烈的时期，于报纸上大登广告，开列出同制造这种导弹有关的八千多家大小厂商的名单，以壮声势。结果，就造成像不久前国防部退职的陆军中将盖文所早已说过的：“大企业的压力使政府被迫去决定制造已过时的武器系统。”
    最近由于这些公司搞得太不像话，美国公众啧有烦言，美国国会不得不装模作样地指定了一个由民主党议员爱德华·哈伯特率领的委员会来调查曾在五角大楼担任过领导职务而现在在大飞机公司任职者的名单。但如果认为这样的“调查”会在公众面前揭穿三军斗争背后的实际状况，那显然是太天真了。甚至连“纽约先驱论坛报”都认为这只是隔靴搔痒而已。
