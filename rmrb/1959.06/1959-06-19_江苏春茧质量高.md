Jiangsu Province has reaped a bumper harvest of the first batch of spring cocoons. According to statistics from seventeen counties, 361 silk farmers achieved a yield of over 100 jin per 100 cocoon cards for the first batch of spring cocoons. In comparison, only 354 silk farmers in the entire province achieved a yield of 100 jin per 100 cocoon cards for the whole of last year.

Among those who achieved a bumper harvest of the first batch of spring cocoons were the old silk-producing areas of Wuxi, Wujiang, and Jiangyin, as well as the new silk-producing areas of Jurong, Suining, Pei County, and Binhai. The common characteristics of this year's spring cocoons are: large cocoons, thick cocoon layers, fewer waste cocoons, and a high rate of successful reeling, with generally over 98 percent of the cocoons suitable for silk reeling.

    江苏春茧质量高
    江苏省第一批春茧丰收。据十七个县统计，第一批春茧单产百斤以上的就有三百六十一张，而去年全省全年单产百斤茧的只有三百五十四张。
    获得第一批春茧丰收的有无锡、吴江、江阴等老蚕区，也有句容、睢宁、沛县、滨海等新蚕区。今年春茧的共同特点是：茧子大，茧层厚，下脚茧少，上车率高，可以缫丝的茧子一般在百分之九十八以上。
