Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 20th: Our reporters Gong Ce and Lin Tian report: The famous highland city of Lhasa is advancing by leaps and bounds. In the three months since the rebellion was quelled, the face of the city has undergone tremendous changes, presenting a picture of new life everywhere.

The citizens of Lhasa have been deeply impressed by the unprecedentedly stable social order over the past three months. Residents no longer hear the unsettling sounds of gunfire in the middle of the night, as they did when the rebels occupied the city. Women can now walk home alone from the cinema late at night, something that was unheard of in Lhasa in the past. Shops reopened as usual after the rebellion was quelled, stalls lined the streets around Barkhor, and the streets were bustling with people. The Qinghai-Tibet Highway, which had been damaged by the rebels, has long been open to traffic, and the donkey caravans coming into the city from the surrounding countryside to sell agricultural products arrive in an endless stream every day. The prices of essential goods in the Lhasa market have remained stable since the suppression of the rebellion. In front of the Jokhang Temple, men and women bring yak butter for offerings every day, turning prayer wheels as they go to worship. The whole city is filled with an atmosphere of peace and tranquility.

Since the rebellion was quelled, Lhasa has undergone large-scale cleaning and renovation, and the city appearance has been completely renewed. Every morning, people can be seen sweeping the streets in front of their houses, and some residents have even wallpapered the old walls of their homes. The uneven streets have been filled in, the sewage pits have disappeared, and the piles of garbage have been cleared away. According to statistics from the Lhasa Military Control Commission, the state has spent nearly 7,000 workdays on repairing the road surfaces and sewers of the main streets since the rebellion was quelled, using the method of providing work as a form of relief. A smooth, broad avenue more than 500 meters long has been built in the city center of Barkhor. Construction of a new 160-meter-long road from the People's Hospital to the Potala Palace has also begun. A seven-mile road from Norbulingka to Jokhang Temple, which was damaged by the rebels, has now been repaired. In addition to the main roads, residents have also repaired the roads in the city's small alleys on their own. Lhasa residents have also universally dug and repaired household toilets, and some of the fifty public toilets to be built by the Municipal Military Control Commission have already been started. Residents throughout the city have also spontaneously launched a campaign to repair sewers, and many patriotic upper-class figures and residents have participated in this voluntary labor. In just a few days, the residents dug and repaired more than 500 meters of main sewer lines and cleared a 1,680-meter-long drainage ditch that runs through the city. Each household has also dug and repaired its own small drainage ditches leading to the main sewer.

After the rebellion was quelled, the enthusiasm of Lhasa citizens for their new life was touching. Lhasa residents have spontaneously established many cultural schools, and many citizens have enrolled to study. Some of the students studying in the cultural schools are newly liberated serfs. Other cultural activities are also being gradually developed. Since the suppression of the rebellion, a total of six mass amateur song and dance troupes have been established in the city, with more than 200 participants. Painters and old artists are also being organized. The Military Control Commission has also established a People's Cinema and two mobile projection teams to show movies to residents. After films such as "The White-Haired Girl" were shown here, they caused a sensation throughout the city and were warmly welcomed by the people.

According to statistics, since the rebellion was quelled, more than 1,400 people with labor capacity in Lhasa have found jobs with the help of the Military Control Commission, and a large number of poor residents have received relief. Twenty-eight poor households have formed a production team with the help of the Military Control Commission's work team and the residents' committee, and have reclaimed 36 acres of wasteland. The nearby People's Liberation Army soldiers and more than 2,000 residents turned out to help them build irrigation canals and deliver manure. Now, green barley has grown on the new land of these poor people. As the Military Control Commission has made arrangements for the city's poor in various ways, the dilapidated "untouchable settlements" that were once seen everywhere in the city have now basically disappeared. Many of the locations of the "untouchable settlements" have now been turned into vegetable gardens. The "untouchables" have all moved into new homes prepared for them by the Military Control Commission, and some have returned to the countryside to participate in production.

These changes mark that the Tibetan people are gradually getting rid of the disaster of the serf system. The new life is only just beginning, and Lhasa in the future will become an even more beautiful and happy plateau city.

    社会安定　物价平稳　文化活跃　市容一新
    拉萨人民热爱新生活
    新华社拉萨20日电　本社记者宫策、林田报道：著名的高原古城拉萨正在大步前进。在叛乱平息后的三个月中，这里的面貌有了巨大的改变，到处呈现出一片新生的气象。
    拉萨市民三个月来对空前安定的社会秩序有着深刻的印象。居民们再也听不到叛匪盘踞期间那种令人不安的半夜枪声了。妇女们现在可以在夜深人静的时候，一个人从电影院走回自己的家，而这是拉萨过去所没有的事。商店在叛乱平息后就照常营业，八角街一带路旁摆满了货摊，街上人群熙攘。曾遭到叛匪破坏的青藏公路早已畅通，从四乡进城来出售农产品的毛驴群，每天络绎不绝。拉萨市场主要物资的价格，从平叛以来一直稳定。在大昭寺门前，每天都有男男女女带着供佛的酥油，摇着转经筒，走去朝拜。全城到处都洋溢着和平安静的气氛。
    叛乱平息以后，拉萨进行了大规模的清扫和整修，市容焕然一新。每天早晨，人们可以看到有许多老人和妇女在打扫自己门前的街道，有的居民还把家里的旧墙壁也用纸裱糊起来。现在坎坷不平的街道填平了，污水坑不见了，垃圾堆也清除掉了。据拉萨市军管会统计，叛乱平息以后，国家通过以工代赈的办法，共花了近七千个工作日，来整修主要街道的路面和下水道。市中心的八角街已修了一条五百多公尺长的平坦大马路。从人民医院通往布达拉宫的一条一百六十公尺长的新马路，也已开始动工兴修。从罗布林卡通大昭寺的一条七华里长的马路，曾遭到叛匪的破坏，现在也已修整完毕。除了干道外，居民们还自己动手整修了全市小巷里的道路。拉萨居民还普遍挖修了家庭用的厕所，市军管会将在全市修建的五十个公共厕所，有的已经动工。全市居民还自动发起了一个整修下水道的运动，许多爱国的上层人士和居民一道参加了这一义务劳动。居民们在短短几天中就挖修了五百多公尺长的下水道干线，疏通了一千六百八十公尺长的一条贯通全市的排水道，每家居民又都各自挖修了自家通往总水道的小阴沟。
    叛乱平息以后，拉萨市民对待新生活的热情，令人感动。拉萨居民自动创办了许多所文化学校，很多市民报名参加了学习。在文化学校学习的学生中，有些还是刚刚获得解放的家奴。其他的文化活动也正在逐步展开，平叛以后全市共成立了六个群众业余歌舞队，参加歌舞队的有二百多人。画匠和旧艺人等也正在组织起来。军管会还创办了一所人民电影院，另外成立了两个流动放映队为居民放映电影，“白毛女”等影片在这里放映以后，轰动全市，受到人们的热烈欢迎。
    据统计，叛乱平息后，拉萨已有一千四百多名有劳动力的人在军管会的帮助下得到了职业，另外还有大批贫苦居民得到了救济。有二十八户贫苦居民在军管会工作队和居民委员会帮助下组成了一个生产队，开垦了三十六克荒地，附近的解放军战士和两千多居民一齐出动帮助他们修水渠和送粪。现在这些贫民的新土地，已经长出了绿油油的青稞。由于军管会对全市贫民用各种方式进行了安排，过去全市到处可见的残破不堪的“贱民窟”，现在已经基本上消失。许多“贱民窟”的地方，现在已经变成了菜园。“贱民”们都搬入了军管会为他们准备的新居，有的已回到农村参加生产。
    这些变化，标志着西藏人民正在逐步摆脱农奴制度的灾难。新的生活还只是开始，今后的拉萨将变成更加美丽、幸福的高原城市。
