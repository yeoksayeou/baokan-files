Guilin Landscape
——Also Discussing Natural Beauty
Zhang Geng

I had long heard that "Guilin's landscape is the best in the world," but I never had the opportunity to appreciate it. This time, due to some chance, I came to Guilin and happened to have ample time to enjoy a leisurely tour.

Guilin has a lot of rain, and our visit coincided with a rainy season, so we couldn't travel quickly. But how could this surging enthusiasm for travel be suppressed! After a short stroll in the city's parks, we decided to go to Yangshuo first. Although Yangshuo also has a lot of rain, it has less than Guilin. This broke our ideal arrangement because Yangshuo has the most beautiful scenery in this area, with the so-called "Yangshuo's landscape is the best in Guilin." We originally wanted to progress from shallow to deep, gradually entering a better state, but now we had to start with the most beautiful place first.

Early in the morning, we boarded a small wooden boat on the Li River in the drizzle and began our tour. It is sixty-five kilometers from Guilin to Yangshuo, and there are originally two routes, land and water. The land route by car only takes two hours, while the water route takes a whole day. But if you want to appreciate the beautiful scenery, you have to take a boat. Much of the scenery of Guilin and Yangshuo is along this route.

As the boat started to move forward, the comrades familiar with the area pointed out the Seven Star Cave and Crescent Moon Mountain to us, explaining the reasons for their names. It turns out that the mountains in this area are named for their shapes, such as Elephant Trunk Hill, which looks like an elephant stretching its trunk to drink water by the river, and so on. These names are even more numerous in Yangshuo, such as Flying Phoenix Mountain, which looks like a large bird about to take flight, Cat Mountain, which looks like a sitting kitten, Dragon Head Mountain, which looks like a dragon's head opening to the sky, and Green Lotus Peak, which looks like a budding green lotus. When did these mountains get their names? It is difficult to verify, but it seems to be very early. Turning over the old Yangshuo County Chronicles, one can find a poem written by Shen Bin, who served as the county magistrate here during the Qianfu period of the Tang Dynasty:

	Five willow trees in front of Tao Yuanming's door, flowers in Pan Yue's Heyang county;
	How can these two places compare to Yangshuo, where people live in Green Lotus Peak.
It turns out that these mountains already had their current names a thousand years ago.

These figurative names indeed arouse more interest from tourists. If these mountains did not have these names, much of the interest would be reduced. On our way to Yangshuo, we also saw many strange peaks, but the comrades who led us on the tour were not familiar with the local stories and could not name them, which made us only glance at the beautiful scenery without leaving a deeper impression. People are like people to nature, if they are not familiar with it, do not understand it, it is impossible to have a deeper impression, let alone generate more feelings. The names of many mountains and rivers, especially the names of this special landscape in Guilin, can be said to represent people's views or understandings of its characteristics. Knowing the name also means a preliminary understanding of it.

However, I did not have the feeling that if these mountains had never had names, they would have completely become stubborn rocks, unable to give people any pleasure. On the contrary, in this atmosphere of "unfamiliarity," the picturesque environment, the haziness in the drizzle, the mirror-like calm of the water when the rain stopped and the clouds were high, the clear reflections, the green scenery above and below, the oblique rays of sunshine shining on the mountain tops and water surfaces when the evening cleared up, making the entire green world slightly shimmer with a faint golden realm: these are all very charming. Mountains and rivers also have their own personalities. The mountains and rivers of Guilin should not be majestic but gentle and beautiful. Han Yu once had two lines of poetry praising the mountains and rivers of Guilin:

	The river is like a green silk ribbon, the mountains are like jade hairpins.
I think the two images he used to describe the mountains and rivers, the green silk ribbon and the jade hairpin, are quite appropriate. It is not just clever, but good in that it uses these two images to suggest their gentle and beautiful character.

But is the concept of "gentle and beautiful" really inherent in natural objects or is it produced in human society? Only with human gentleness and beauty can we compare it to nature. Han Yu's use of green silk ribbons and jade hairpins to describe mountains and rivers is a concrete proof of this analogy.

Of course, I do not want to deny that natural landscapes must have this comparable condition before the analogy can be attached. Obviously, if we use Han Yu's two lines of poetry to praise Sanmenxia, ​​no one will agree, and even using these two lines of poetry to praise West Lake is not possible. This shows that the characteristics of the Guilin landscape must not obliterate its purely natural conditions.

For example, the climate. Although Guilin is located in the south, the climate is mild. Du Fu once had a poem saying, "The Five Ridges are all hot, but Guilin alone is pleasant." The mountain shapes of Guilin are peculiar and can be used for fantasy and analogy; the water of the Li River is clear and transparent, and you can see the bottom at a glance. These should all be said to be its unique conditions. Without these conditions, there would be no artificial analogy.

But you can also ask the question in reverse, if these natural conditions exist in isolation without these analogies, or simply put, without the relationship between people and it, can the Guilin landscape still have a kind of independent and self-sufficient beauty? This is simply hard to imagine: without people, or more precisely, without the culture produced by human society, there would be no so-called purely natural beauty!

We took a boat to Yangshuo, and we lingered over the scenery and delayed the time, and we walked a section of dark road. At this time, our mood in response to the scenery also changed. Near the water route to Yangshuo County, a large rock stands overlooking the river, and all boats must pass under it; because it looks like a court tablet, it is called Chaohu Mountain. But when we walked under it in the dark, no one told us its name, and there was no prior mental preparation. We only saw a huge monster standing in the air and pressing on our heads, so high that we couldn't see the top. At this time, the intention of lingering on the mountains and rivers had been thrown to the clouds, and what arose spontaneously in our hearts was a sense of dread. After arriving in Yangshuo, we were invited to stay in the county committee. This county committee is surrounded by four mountains. When we walked in, we only saw strange shadows looming in the surroundings, and a large black shadow behind the house was high into the sky. We couldn't help but feel like we had entered the Dongyue Temple when we were children. But the comrades who greeted us led us into the house with a calm and unconscious manner.

The next day when we got up, we saw the mountain mist entering the house, and our eyes were full of verdant greenery. Comrade Ke, who was familiar with the local stories, led us out and enthusiastically pointed out to us: This is Green Lotus Peak, this is Screen Mountain, this is Chubi Peak, here is an upright stone shaped like a scholar with his hands clasped and wearing a crown, named Xilang, and opposite it is an upright stone shaped like a woman in Tang costume and slightly shy, named Yugu. On the opposite side of the river, there is also one called Donglang, and he also told us that these human-shaped stones have produced countless legends. One of them says that Donglang and Xilang came to find Yugu together. Xilang arrived first, and Donglang was one step late and was separated by the river. Therefore, there is a folk rhyme saying: Donglang looks at Xilang, separated by a river.

While speaking, we walked to the foot of Screen Mountain, climbed the steps, and here we could see the scene of Xilang worshiping Yugu very closely: These two stones stood facing each other, separated by a mountain gorge less than five meters apart, one with his hands clasped and the other slightly bowing his head and looking sideways, seeming a little shy. After Comrade Ke pointed it out, almost even the eyes, eyebrows, and the expressions they contained were vividly displayed, and if we added a little fantasy, they would become lively. At this time, the feeling of dread from last night was completely transformed into a feeling of intimacy and playfulness.

In this short period of time from night to morning, my completely different feelings for the scenery enlightened me and gave me a feeling similar to the experience of the historical process of the changing relationship between people and nature. Although my point of feeling is of course not comparable to the complex process of change in the relationship between people and nature, which contains material and spiritual things, and I have no intention of comparing them, because in the night the feeling of some mountain shapes, in addition to being unfamiliar, is also due to the unreality of vision and the unclear view of the object. But it is indeed because this feeling made me more deeply realize that the relationship between people and nature is not naturally harmonious, but full of contradictions. In primitive times, people were unfamiliar with nature. Most of the time, nature was the persecutor and the calamity bringer of people. People had little other feelings for nature except for terror and fear; but as human productivity gradually developed and social life gradually developed, the ability to control nature gradually increased, so people vigorously transformed nature, turning those terrifying forces that harmed mankind into forces that created blessings for people. Just to give an example: after the Dujiangyan irrigation system was built, the flood that destroyed crops was turned into irrigation, making the Chengdu Plain the land of abundance; therefore, in folk legends, the Erlang of Guankou suppressed the terrible Wuzhiqi and replaced him as the water god of Guankou. This change in the goodness and evil of gods vividly expresses the change in the relationship between people and nature.

This change in the relationship between people and nature is very important. Without this change, nature cannot become beautiful for mankind. If nature is just terrifying, it can never give people a sense of beauty. Only when it becomes approachable can people have the opportunity to feel the beauty that exists in it, and can further discover it. The key to this change in the relationship between people and nature lies in the labor that mankind has paid, the transformation of nature that has been carried out, making it more in line with human purposes.

Although the scenery of Yangshuo is very rich in natural interest, it is not without human processing. For example, the Screen Mountain that we once climbed is a straight stone mountain, and it would be impossible to go up without transformation; it is precisely because of people's labor, transformation, and beautification over the years, building stone steps and installing railings, and building a pavilion on the top of the mountain, so that tourists can not only climb to the top, but also rest on the top and avoid the scorching sun and wind and rain in the pavilion. This bare and stubborn mountain has become something that can be approached, so that people can feel intimate, and so that people can create beauty from its original superior natural conditions.

Yangshuo has long been just a county town. Although the county seat was built since the Han Dynasty, it is not the center of culture. Therefore, the processing and beautification of natural scenery is much less than that of Guilin. Guilin has done a lot of processing in this regard. Not only can most of the mountains be climbed, and there are buildings on the mountains, but the most important thing, and the most powerful beautification of the scenery, is a large number of inscriptions and stone carvings by famous people, as well as rich and beautiful legends for each scenic spot. If the material processing of the scenery is to give people the full possibility to approach it, then this inscription and legendary story of the scenery gives it the meaning of an ideological form. After years of accumulation, these things gradually add a fixed meaning to a scenic spot, making it not only a simple natural object, but also not only a simple beauty of mountains and rivers, but also an existence of an ideological form. The scenery of Guilin is famous for its naturalness, and is proud of West Lake in Hangzhou for this reason, but it has not escaped the fate of becoming an ideological form. In fact, there is a lot of ideological processing in the scenery here. Ye Changchi, a epigrapher of the Qing Dynasty, said: "Guilin is the best place for inscriptions from the Tang and Song Dynasties." Almost all the mountains, peaks and caves with names are carved with inscriptions, calligraphy and paintings, and almost all the poets and calligraphers from the Tang Dynasty to Yuan Mei who have been here have left something on the rocks. These things embellish the scenery here even more famous. For example, Duxiu Peak, which is the most famous among the scenery of Guilin, on the one hand because it is in the center of the city, in the former royal city of the Ming Dynasty, and on the other hand because there are many inscriptions and stone carvings in it. On the top of Duxiu Peak, there are four large characters carved on the rock, "South Sky Pillar", which makes it even more famous; and the source of these four characters comes from Zhang Gu's poem "Climbing Duxiu Peak" in the Tang Dynasty:

	A lonely peak is not in the company of other mountains, and it goes straight into the clouds without resting.
	Knowing the meaning of the integration of heaven and earth, the pillar supporting the sky is in the southern continent.
The poem is not particularly outstanding, but it has become famous after being combined with this mountain; and on the contrary, the poem has given the mountain a seemingly unchangeable evaluation, increased its value, and made it the leading scenic spot in Guilin.

Isn't this extra meaning added to the natural scenery possible due to the poet's accidental inspiration? Of course, this is entirely possible. For example, although Han Yu compared the mountains and rivers of Guilin to jade hairpins and green silk ribbons, Liu Zongyuan had a different view. His poem praising the mountains and rivers of Guilin said: "The sharp mountains by the sea are like sword awns, and they cut my sorrowful intestines everywhere in autumn." In his opinion, the scenery here is not gentle at all. But this accidental inspiration of the poet must be tested and selected by history to become a fixed evaluation of the scenery. It is not enough to write it out to become something that will last forever with the scenery. After selection, Han Yu's poem has become a foregone conclusion. Most of the poems praising the mountains and rivers of Guilin later cannot escape Han Yu's stereotype, but few people mention Liu's poem. The standard of this historical selection is very complicated. Taking these two people's poems as an example, one more vividly wrote out the spirit of the mountains and rivers, and the other only expressed the individual's accidental emotions through the mountains and rivers. If linked to the mountains and rivers, the former has a more universal value. But as mentioned earlier, the so-called "mountain and river spirit" described in Han's poem is actually just the humanization of the mountains and rivers, which is a product of ideological form, so the theory that advocates that appreciation is only a purely personal accidental inspiration and is not restricted by the ideological form of the social class is very superficial.

The most obvious example of the scenery having the meaning of an ideological form, or simply saying, having a cultural meaning with class nature, is the Seven Star Cave. This Seven Star Cave is a large cave in Guilin that is three miles long. There are many strange stalactites in it. Its large scale and peculiar shapes are probably rare in the world. No wonder people have developed rich fantasies for many years and have continuously carried out processing and enrichment, creating countless rich and colorful legends. If these legends are recorded, they can probably become a very thick book, but many of them have a strong religious color.

For example, the legend about "Chessboard Mountain" is one of them. It is said that two immortals, Rihua and Yuehua, once lived in this Seven Star Cave, and often played chess on a platform that looked like a chessboard in the cave. During the Tang Dynasty, a county official from a certain place named Zheng Guanqing came to visit, and was invited by the immortals to watch chess on the mountain, and wrote a poem to secretly enlighten him, with sentences such as "Human law has changed thousands of times, and the fairy cave spends only a few breaths." But this county official did not understand the truth in it. It was not until he went to the cave entrance and met two woodcutters that he learned that the chess players were two immortals. After returning home, he found that several years had actually passed during the moment of watching chess. Since then, he resigned from his official position and devoted himself to farming, living to be one hundred and forty years old.

In the Chinese cultural tradition, the appreciation of natural beauty and the Taoist idea of ​​seclusion have a long and deep relationship. Li Bai was a person who loved to travel and enjoy the mountains and rivers very much. He had Taoist ideas and also wrote poems about immortals. Although the religious flavor in the interest of appreciating natural beauty has become thinner and thinner as we get closer to modern times, it is sometimes unavoidable to reveal a kind of escapist and reclusive thought. Chinese people have a deeper love for mountains and rivers, and their feelings are also deeper and more delicate; it may be primarily because the vast majority of people live a rural life, but it cannot be said that it has nothing to do with the ideas of indifference, seclusion, and nobility in the ideological system of the scholar-officials.

But in Chinese culture, the beautification of nature is by no means limited to a negative thought of escape from the world, and there is also another completely different thought. For example, the legend of the Cowherd and the Weaver Girl is not a negative thought of escape from the world, but a positive thought that praises labor, praises love, and always has full hope for the happy life of the working people. This kind of thought comes from the working people. The nature beautified by this kind of thought should be said to be more intimate to people, giving people the courage to live, and therefore it is more beautiful nature.

In this Seven Star Cave, there is a stalactite that is more than three feet high and looks like a standing statue of a woman. The name of this stone is "Liu Sanjie Statue". Liu Sanjie is a singer of folk songs that is popular in Guangxi. She is a Zhuang person, and there are many legends about her. The legend about this statue is this: Liu Sanjie and her lover Baimalang traveled to the Seven Star Cave together, hand in hand climbed "Mount Sumeru" and "South Heaven Gate", and sang songs on the "Tianmen Mountain" for three days and six nights, attracting many young men and women to listen. Later, Sanjie was about to leave, and Baimalang was very reluctant. Sanjie sang two farewell songs for him:

	"I'll leave you! The sun is setting on the ridge in the west.
	Although we are far apart, our hearts are one, our love is as long as the water."

	"The wind blows the clouds but the sky does not move, the water flows in the river but the stones do not flow,
	The lotus root is cut with a knife but the threads do not break, we may seem to have lost each other, but in reality, we have not."
But Baimalang still held Sanjie's hand tightly and refused to let go. Suddenly, Sanjie turned into this stone statue and became an immortal. Baimalang hugged the stone statue and cried for several days. This legend, like all legends about Liu Sanjie, is itself a folk literature that is very rich in emotion and very simple. All the legends about Liu Sanjie depict her as a character who is loyal to love, witty and brave, full of talent, and full of resistance. Although the story of Liu Sanjie ends in tragedy, it reveals what a passionate love for life. This legend has the same characteristics, which is completely different from the negative thought of avoiding the world.

In this way, the so-called natural beauty is not only something that exists independently of human society, but also has class colors in class society, although this class nature is often intricately intertwined in the face of concrete things.

In the process of building socialism, the relationship between people and nature has developed further. The spirit of "making high mountains bow their heads and making rivers give way" shows that we will completely get rid of the situation of being enslaved by nature. On the contrary, we will completely dominate nature and become its very powerful master. In the past, Guangxi was a grain-deficient area, and it was necessary to transfer some grain from outside every year to solve the problem of eating, but since the Great Leap Forward last year, this situation has completely changed and it is completely self-sufficient. This is inseparable from their hard efforts to transform nature. Taking Yangshuo as an example, although the mountains and rivers are so beautiful, it used to be a severely arid area. In 1955 and 1956, it suffered severe droughts, and tens of thousands of acres of farmland died of drought every year. During the Great Leap Forward, great efforts were made to build water conservancy projects. A total of four large reservoirs were built, costing 1.2 million labor days. Yangshuo County only has 60,000 laborers, and each person spent an average of 20 labor days. This cannot be said to be not full of enthusiasm. After this hard work, 80% of the farmland in the county has been water conservancy, and a small hydropower station has been established in one of the Baisha Reservoirs. For rural areas, electricity generation is not just a matter of turning on lights and watching movies. More importantly, it is to liberate a large number of laborers. We visited a small thermal power plant built by them in Yuejin in a welfare commune (formerly known as Fulizhi Township), which is fifteen miles away from Yangshuo. The electricity generated by this plant can drive fifteen horsepower, grind 12,000 catties of rice during the day, and can also supply lighting for the town where the commune is located at night, which not only saves lamp oil, but also replaces the work that 400 people used to do in a day with six people. If small reservoirs like these have power stations built on them, there will be a big change in rural life. This welfare commune did not engage in much basic construction, because a major change will happen here soon. The autonomous region (ie, the province) plans to build a large dam in Zhaoping, and 60% of the land in this commune will be submerged. Not only that, but even Yangshuo County must move, because it is entirely in the reservoir. The amount of electricity generated after the reservoir is completed has not yet been accurately estimated, but it is quite a lot.

Moreover, the water of the entire Li River has also increased by several meters. Since even Yangshuo County has been submerged, it is certainly necessary to greatly change the natural appearance here. It will no longer be a winding green water surrounding many verdant peaks, but will become a large lake with many islands floating in the middle. Some of the scenery will disappear from now on. For example, there is a place called "Baisha Fishing Fire" on the bank of the Li River, where many fish are hidden in the caves on the river bank. Every night, fishing boats use fire to lure the fish out, and let cormorants catch them. Looking from the pavilion of Jianshan Temple under Bilian Peak from afar, it is said that you can only see the lights of the fishing fire, which becomes a scenery. Perhaps it is interesting to stand by and watch without participating in the labor, this strange firelight can arouse people's interest, but it is by no means a pleasant and easy labor to support a boat to the cliff cave to catch fish at night. The same situation is also called "Guanyai". The cliff cave here is very deep, and it is said that it can go all the way to Daozhou in Hunan. It is said that on a certain Dragon Boat Festival in the past, a dragon boat rowed in, and the entire boat was submerged in it and never came out again. Even today, sometimes in the middle of the night, you can still hear the sound of gongs and drums inside. This legend reflects the tragic memories of life. Laborers catch fish in the cave at night, and cannot help but think of this story with a terrifying mood, and even seem to hear the sound of gongs and drums. Such "scenery" is buried under the reservoir in the new era, which symbolizes that labor will become more pleasant and easier day by day in the future, and those endless tragic pains, the days that are always connected with this most precious thing of mankind, the labor by which people create the entire happiness, will also be buried forever under the reservoir.

Now many labors are still hard for people. Supporting a boat on the Li River is one of them. The Li River has shallow water and many shoals. When going against the current, it is really a huge labor. Two people cannot stop supporting the boat with two bamboo poles for a minute, so that the boat can go up the shoal. As long as you take a breath, the boat will slide down several feet. In the Great Leap Forward, people created flywheel-type pedal paddles, and labor was much reduced, but they still could not be used to go up the shoals. After the reservoir is built and the water level is raised, the water surface in this area will be as calm as lake water, and labor will be much easier. Now the wooden boat transportation cooperatives here are raising funds to buy engines to mechanize all the wooden boats. At that time, people will see beautiful yachts shuttling back and forth on the mirror-like lake, and those beautiful Bilian Peak, Longtou Mountain, etc., will stand upright in the middle of the lake, either like lotuses emerging from the water, with clear and green reflections, or like a diving dragon raising its head, with its claws and tail still hidden in the depths of the green waves. At that time, the scenery of Guilin will truly become a fairyland on earth.

Society is changing, the relationship between nature and people is changing, and people's views on natural beauty must also change. When nature completely disappears from threatening people, and people completely eliminate the fear of nature, nature must be more intimate and more beautiful to people. At that time, nature will inspire people with endless poetry and endless fantasy, and in these poetry and fantasy, the dark, tragic, and terrifying shadows of the old era will be swept away, the thoughts of escaping from the world and retreating will be eliminated, and replaced by the enthusiasm for creativity and struggle that is revitalized, and the artistic fruits of this enthusiasm will in turn inspire our labor to create a happier life for mankind.

Editor's note: "Guilin Landscape" is a travelogue that makes people interested in reading, and it is also an article that explores aesthetic issues. It is relatively easy to read among this type of article. In recent years, there has been controversy over aesthetic issues. In this article, the author puts forward his own views, which can of course be discussed. Today, we also publish a summary of Comrade Li Keran's "Random Talk on Landscape Painting". This is a good article on painting creation, especially on the creation of artistic conception in landscape painting. The author makes incisive arguments based on traditional and his own creative experience. The content of the article is also related to the view of natural beauty, which helps to provide a reference when discussing this issue.

    桂林山水
    ——兼谈自然美
    张庚
    早就听说“桂林山水甲天下”，一直没有机会欣赏，这回因了某种机缘到了桂林，又恰恰有比较充足的时间，得到了畅游的机会。
    桂林多雨，我们来游的机会不巧，正逢着一个多雨的季节，不能很快地出游。但是这高涨的游兴怎么能够压得下去呢！小逛了市区的公园之后，就决定先去阳朔。阳朔虽也多雨，但比桂林就少了。这件事打破了我们理想的安排，因为在这一带的风景中间阳朔的最美，有所谓“阳朔山水甲桂林”之称，我们原是想由浅到深，渐入佳境的，现在只好先从最美的地方看起。
    一早在细雨中上了漓江的小木船，开始了游览的航程。桂林去阳朔六十五公里，原是有水陆两条路的，陆上的汽车只要两小时，而水上的航程却要走一整天，但是如果要欣赏美丽的景致就得坐船，桂林、阳朔的风景许多就在这条航路上。
    船开始向前移动，熟悉的同志为我们指点着七星岩、月牙山，一面为我们解释着命名的理由。原来这一带的山都因为它的形象得到自己的名字，如象鼻山有些像一只伸着鼻子在江边吸水的象等等。这些名字到了阳朔就更多，如飞凤山就像一只展翅欲飞的大鸟，猫儿山就像一只坐着的小猫，龙头山就像一个张口向天的龙头，碧莲峰就像一朵含苞将放的碧莲，诸如此类。这些山的名字从什么时候就有了的呢？这已经很难稽考了，但似乎是很早的；翻开阳朔旧县志就可以发现有一位唐朝乾符年间在这里做过县令的沈彬写的一首诗：
    陶令门前五株柳，潘岳河阳一县花；
    两处怎如阳朔好，碧莲峰里住人家。原来在千年以前这些山就已有了现在的名字。
    这些象形的命名的确引起了游人更多的兴趣，如果这些山没有这些名字，就会减少了许多的兴趣。我们在到阳朔的路上也看到了许多奇特的山峰，但是领着我们来游的同志对于这一带的掌故不熟悉，说不出名字来，这就使得我们虽然面对美景，只能一晃而过，留不下较深的印象。人对于自然也像对于人一样，如果不熟悉，不了解，就不可能有更深的印象，也更谈不上产生更多的感情。有许多山水的名字，特别是桂林的这种特殊山水的名字，可以说是代表着人们对它的特点看法或理解的。知道了名字也就意味着对它初步的理解。
    不过我并没有这样的感觉：假使这些山从来没有名字，它就完全成了顽石，不能给人任何心快神怡的享受。相反地，就是在这种“不相识”的气氛中，那种山明水秀的环境，那种细雨中的蒙矓，那种雨止云高时候波平如镜，倒影明澈，上下一片青碧的景色，那种傍晚放晴时候一脉斜辉映在山头水面，使得整个青碧的天地里略微闪耀着一点淡淡的金色的境界：这些都是非常妩媚的。山水也有自己的性格，桂林的山水应当不是雄伟的而是柔美的。韩愈曾经有两句诗咏桂林山水道：
    江作青罗带，山如碧玉簪。我觉得他所借以形容山水的两个形象，青罗带和碧玉簪是相当恰切的，不只是巧，好的是在用这两个形象暗示出了它们的柔美性格。
    但是“柔美”这个概念难道真是自然物所固有的而不是在人类社会中所产生的吗？有了人的柔美，然后才能把它比拟到自然上面去，韩愈用青罗带和碧玉簪去形容山水正是这种比拟的具体证明。
    当然我也不是想否定自然风景必须具备了这种可比拟的条件然后才能把比拟附丽上去，很显然，如果我们拿韩愈这两句诗去咏三门峡，那就谁也不能同意了，甚至于要拿这两句诗去咏西湖也是不行的。这就可以看出桂林山水所具有的特点中间决不能抹杀它纯自然的条件。
    比方说气候，桂林虽地处南国，气候却是温和的，杜甫曾有“五岭皆炎热，宜人独桂林”的诗句，桂林的山形奇特，可供幻想和比拟；漓江的水，清明澄澈，一望到底，这些都应当说是它与众不同的条件，离开这些条件也就谈不上人为的比拟。
    但也可以反过来问一句，离开了这些比拟，只是孤立地存在着这种自然条件，或者简明地说，离开了人和它的关系，桂林山水能不能还有一种什么独立自足的美存在着呢？这简直很难想像：没有人，或者更正确些说，没有人类社会所产生的文化，会有所谓纯自然的美！
    我们坐船到阳朔，在路上留连风景耽搁了时间，曾经走了一段黑路。在这时候我们对于  风景所反应的心情也就变了。快到阳朔县城的水路上矗立着一面大岩石俯视江中，所有的船都必须从它下面经过；因为它很像一个朝笏，所以叫做朝笏山。但当我们黑夜从它下面走过的时候，既没有人告诉我们它的名字，又没有任何事先的精神准备，只见忽然有一个庞然大物临空而立，并且压在我们头上，高不见顶，那种对于山水的留连之意，这时已经抛到九霄云外去了，所油然生于心头的，倒是一股森森之感。到了阳朔之后，我们被招待住在县委会里。这个县委会处在四山环绕之中，我们一走进来，蒙矓中只见四周怪影凌空，屋后一大黑影高入云霄，心中未免有些小时候进了东岳庙的感觉。但是那几位迎接我们的同志却是泰然无所觉地把我们领进了屋。
    到了第二天一起来，只见山岚入户，满眼青翠欲滴。熟悉当地掌故的克同志领我们出来，热心地指给我们：这是碧莲峰，这是屏风山，这是矗笔峰，这里有一尊竖立的石头形如拱手戴冠的书生名叫西郎，它的对面有一尊竖立的石头形如唐装士女并且略带腼腆的名叫玉姑。在河的对面还有一尊叫东郎，并且还告诉我们，这几尊人形的石头在这里产生了无数传说，其中之一说，东郎和西郎一起来找玉姑，西郎先赶到了，东郎来迟了一步，被江水隔住了，所以民间有两句韵语道：东郎望西郎，相隔一条江。
    一面说，一面就走到了屏风山下，拾级而登，在这里可以十分逼近地看到西郎拜玉姑的情景：这两尊石头相隔一段不到五公尺的山峡，对峙而立，一个拱手，一个微微俯首侧脸，似乎真有些腼腆的样子。经过克同志一指点，几乎连眼睛眉毛和它们所含的表情都活现出来了，如果稍加幻想，就灵动起来了。到了这时，昨夜森然可怖的感觉又完全变成亲切可玩的感觉了。
    在这个短短的从夜到明的时间中，我这种对于风景截然不同的感受，启发了我，使我对于人与自然间关系变化的历史过程，有了一种类似体验的感受，虽然我的这点感受当然不能和人与自然关系之间的变化这种包含着物质上和精神上的复杂过程相比，我也没有意思把它们相比，因为在夜里对于一些山形的感受，除了由于陌生之外，也还有由于视觉不真，看对象不清而来的原因。但的确因为这点感受使我比较深切地认识到人和自然两者并不是天然和谐的，而是充满了矛盾的。在原始时代，人对自然是陌生的，在大多数的时间里，自然是人的迫害者，降灾者，人对于自然除了恐怖畏惧之外，很少其它感情；但当人类的生产力逐渐发达，社会生活逐渐发展之后，对于自然就逐渐增长了控制的能力，人于是大力去改造自然，把那些为害人类的恐怖力量变成了为人造福的力量。随便举个例：筑成了都江堰之后，就把破坏庄稼的水患变成了灌溉之利，使得成都盆地变成了天府之国；于是在民间的传说里，灌口二郎才镇压了可怕的巫支岐，并且代替他做了灌口的水神。这种神的善恶的变化恰恰是形象化地表现了人们对于自然之间关系的变化。
    人与自然之间这种关系的变化是十分重要的，没有这种变化，自然对于人类就无法变成美的。如果自然只是可怖的，它决不能给人美感，只有它成为可亲的时候，人才能够有可能感到它中间存在着美，也才能够进一步去发现它。而这种人与自然之间关系的变化，关键在于人类付出了劳动，对于自然进行了改造，使它更合于人的目的。
    阳朔的风景虽然非常富于天然的趣味，可也并非不是经过人的加工的。比方我们曾经攀登的屏风山，本是直立的石头山，要是不加改造就是无法上去的；正因为多少年以来经过了人们的劳动，与以改造，与以美化，砌了石级，安了栏杆，在山的绝顶上还盖了一座亭子，使得游人不仅可以登临，而且可以在顶上休息，在亭内避烈日风雨，这座光秃的顽山才成了可以接近的东西，才能使人感到亲切，也才能使人有可能从它原有的优越自然条件里创造出美来。
    阳朔长久以来只不过是一座县城，虽然从汉代起就建了县治，究竟还不是文化的中心，因此对于自然风景的加工和美化，比起桂林本地来就不够得多了。桂林在这方面是作了大量加工的，不仅仅绝大多数的山都可以攀登，山上都有建筑，最重要的，也是最有力地美化了风景的，是大量的名人的题咏和刻石，以及对于每一名胜的丰富美丽的传说故事。如果说对于风景的物质加工是给人们充分可能去接近它，而这种对于风景的题咏和传说故事却给了它以观念形态的意义。这些东西经过多少年的积累就逐渐逐渐给一处风景名胜加上了固定的意义，使它不独不只是一种单纯的自然物，而且也不只是单纯的山水之美，更成了一种观念形态的存在。桂林的风景以天然著称，并且以此而骄傲于杭州的西湖，但它一点也没有逃脱成为观念形态的存在这个命运。事实上，这里的风景中间这类观念形态上的加工特别多，清朝金石家叶昌炽就说过：“唐宋题名之渊薮以桂林为甲。”几乎这里所有有名字的山峰岩洞无不是到处刻得有题咏、书画，而且差不多自唐以来历代的诗人和书画家凡到过这里的都要在岩石上留下一点什么，从颜真卿一直到袁枚。这些东西就把这里的风景点缀得更加有名了。比方独秀峰，这是桂林风景中间最著名的，一方面因为它是在城市的中心，在过去明朝的王城里面，另一方面也因为其中的题咏刻石多。独秀峰上面有四个斗大的磨岩题字是“南天一柱”，这就使得它的名气更响；而这四个字的来源却出自唐朝张固的登独秀峰诗：
    孤峰不与众山俦，直入青云势未休。
    会得乾坤融结意，擎天一柱在南洲。诗并不是特别出色，但和这个山结合起来之后就成为有名的了；而反过来呢，诗又给山作了一种似乎不可更改的定评，增加了它的身价，使它获得了桂林名胜中首屈一指的地位。
    这种对于自然风景所外加的意义，难道不可能是诗人偶然的兴会所至摇笔而来的吗？当然这是完全可能的。比方说，韩愈虽然把桂林山水比作碧玉簪和青罗带，但柳宗元却有另外的看法，他咏桂林山水的诗说：“海畔尖山似剑铓，秋来处处割愁肠。”在他看来，这里的风景是一点也不温柔的。但这种诗人偶然的兴会要成为风景的定评却必须经过历史的考验和选择，并非只要一写出来就能够成为与风景同垂不朽的东西。经过选择之后，韩诗已经成了定局了。后人泛咏桂林山水之作，多半逃不出韩诗的窠臼，而柳诗却很少有人提起了。这种历史的选择，其标准是很复杂的。拿这两个人的诗而论，一个更加肖似地写出了山水的精神，另一个却只是借山水发抒了个人偶然的情绪，如果和山水联系起来，前者就有了更普遍的价值。但如前所述，韩诗所描写的所谓“山水精神”，实际只是山水的人化，是一种观念形态的产物，所以那种主张欣赏只是纯个人的偶然兴会，是不受社会阶级的观念形态所约制的理论是非常表面的。
    风景之具有观念形态的意义，或者简直说，具有一种有阶级性的文化的意义最明显的眼前例子莫过于七星岩。这个七星岩是桂林一个长达三华里的大山洞，其中有许多千奇百怪的钟乳石，其规模之大，形态的奇瑰，恐怕在世界上是少有的，难怪多少年代以来人们发挥了丰富的幻想，并且不断进行了加工和充实，创造出无数丰富多采的传说来。如果把这些传说记录下来，大概可以成为很厚的一大本，但其中有许多却带着浓厚的宗教色彩。
    比方关于“棋盘山”的传说就是其中之一。据说这七星岩里曾经住过日华、月华两位仙人，常常在洞里一块有些像棋盘的平台上下棋。在唐朝时候，曾有一位某地的县官叫郑冠卿的来游，被仙人邀到山上看棋，并且做了诗暗暗地点化他，诗中有“人间律历千回换，仙洞光阴数息余”的句子。可是这位县官却没有悟到其中的道理。直到他出到洞口遇见两个樵夫，才知道那下棋的是两位仙人。回家之后，发现看棋的这一会儿实际上已经过了好几年了。从此辞官不做，专事耕种，活到了一百四十岁。
    在中国的文化传统中间，自然美的欣赏和道教的出世思想有着相当悠久深切的关系。李白是个极爱游山玩水的人，他就有着道家的思想，还写过游仙诗。虽然越到近代，欣赏自然美的趣味中间宗教气味越来越稀薄，但有时还不免流露出一种避世的隐逸思想来。中国人对于山水的爱好较深，感受也比较深切细致；可能首先是由于绝大多数的人过着农村生活，但也不能说和士大夫们思想体系中间恬淡、隐退、高逸的这类思想没有关系。
    但在中国文化中间，对于自然的美化决不止于一种遁世的消极思想，也还有另一种完全不同的思想。比方牛郎织女的传说就不是一种消极的避世思想，而是一种歌颂劳动、歌颂爱情、并且对劳动人民的幸福生活总是怀着满腔希望的积极思想。这种思想是来自劳动人民中间的，经过这种思想美化了的自然，应当说是对人们更亲切的，给予人们以生活勇气的，因此也就是更加美丽的自然。
    在这七星岩里，有一块三尺多高仿佛一尊女人立像的钟乳石，这块石头名字叫做“刘三姐像”。刘三姐是广西所流传的唱山歌的歌仙，是僮族人，有关她的传说是很多的。关于这尊像的传说是这样：刘三姐和她的情人白马郎同游七星岩，手挽手登上了“须弥山”和“南天门”，又在“天台”上唱了三天六夜的歌，引动许多青年男女来听。后来三姐要走了，白马郎十分舍不得，三姐就为他唱了两首离歌：
    “少陪了！日头落岭在西方。
    天各一方心一个，我俩多情水样长。”
    “风吹云动天不动，河里水流石不流，
    刀切莲藕丝不断，我俩明丢暗不丢。”
    但是白马郎还是紧紧拉着三姐的手不放。忽然间，三姐就化作这尊石像成了仙。白马郎还抱着石像哭了好几天。这个传说也和所有有关刘三姐的传说一样，本身就是一种感情非常丰富而又十分朴素的民间文学。所有有关刘三姐的传说，都把她描写成一个爱情忠贞、机智勇敢、富于天才同时又富于反抗性的人物。虽然刘三姐的故事是以悲剧结尾的，但却流露出多么热爱生活的积极感情来啊。这一段传说也同样有这个特点，这是和那种避世的消极思想完全不同的。
    这样看起来，所谓自然美不仅不是脱离人类社会而独立存在的东西，而且在阶级社会里它还是具有阶级色彩的东西，虽然这种阶级性在具体的事物面前往往是错综复杂地纠结在一起的。
    在建设社会主义的过程中间，人们和自然的关系更有了进一步的发展。那种“叫高山低头，叫河水让路”的精神，表现出我们将完全摆脱受自然奴役的局面，反过来，我们将要完全支配自然，成了它非常有权力的主人了。广西过去是个缺粮区，每年必须从外面调来若干粮食才能解决吃饭问题，但是去年大跃进以来，这个局面完全改变了，完全能够自给自足了。这是和他们艰苦努力地改造自然分不开的。拿阳朔来说，虽然山水那么美，但过去却是一个苦旱的地区，1955年、1956年都还遭过大旱灾，每年都有几万亩田旱死。大跃进的时候，下了大力搞水利，一共修了四个大水库，花了一百二十万个工；阳朔全县才有六万个劳动力，每人平均出了二十个工，这不能说不是干劲冲天的。经过这一番艰苦的努力，现在全县有80％的田地水利化了，其中有一个白沙水库还建立了小型发电站。发电，对于农村来说，不只是点电灯、看电影的问题，更重要的还是解放大批劳动力。我们在离阳朔十五华里的一个福利公社（原名伏荔乡）里参观了他们在跃进中间建立的一个小型火力发电厂，这个厂所发的电可以带动十五马力，白天碾米一万二千斤，晚上还能供公社所在市镇的照明，这就不光省了灯油，还能把过去四百人一天干的活由六个人代替了。如果这些小型的水库上都建起了发电站，农村生活就要起个很大的变化。这个福利公社没有搞多少基本建设，因为不久之后这里会发生一个大变动。自治区（即省）里计划在昭平修个大水坝，这个社里的土地要淹掉60％。不但如此，连阳朔县城都得搬家，因为它整个都在水库里了。水库建成以后，所发的电量现在还没有准确的估计，反正是相当不小的。
    而且整个漓江的水还因此提高了好几公尺。既然连阳朔县城都淹了，当然也要使这里的自然面貌大大改观，不再是一条萦洄的碧水绕着许多青翠的山峰，而将成为一个大湖中间浮着许多岛屿了。有一部分风景将从此不见了，比方在漓江边上有一处叫“白沙渔火”的，那里江岸水边的崖洞中藏着许多鱼，每到夜里，渔船用火将鱼群引出来，让鸬鹚去叼。远远地从碧莲峰下鉴山寺的亭子上望去，据说只见渔火点点，成为一景。也许袖手旁观而不去参加劳动，这奇特的火光能引起人的兴趣，但是深夜撑船到崖洞里去捉鱼，无论如何不能说是愉快轻松的劳动。同样情形还有一处叫“观崖”。这里的崖洞很深，传说能一直通到湖南的道州。据讲从前在某个端阳节有条龙船划进去，全船淹在里面从此就没有出来。至今在深夜里，有时还能听见里面的锣鼓声音呢。这个传说反映了生活中悲惨的记忆，劳动者深夜在洞里捉鱼，不免带着恐怖的心情想起这段故事来，甚至仿佛听到了锣鼓之声。这样的“景致”在新时代里被埋葬在水库的底下，正象征着将来劳动一天天要变成更加愉快轻松的，而那些无尽的悲惨痛苦，老是和这人类最宝贵的东西，人们凭着它创造了整个幸福的东西——劳动连在一起的日子也将永埋葬在水库底下去了。
    现在有许多劳动对于人还是苦事。在漓江上撑船就是其中之一。漓江水浅滩多，当逆水过滩的时候真是巨大的劳动，两个人两条竹竿一分钟都不能停地撑着，船才能够上滩，只要一歇气，船就溜下去几丈远了。在大跃进中，人们创造了飞轮式的脚踏桨，劳动是减轻多了，但上滩还是不能利用它。等水库修成，水位提高之后，这一带的水面就要像湖水一样平静了，劳动就轻松多了。现在这里的木船运输合作社正在集资买发动机，要把所有的木船全部机械化。到了那时人们将看到美丽的游艇在镜子一样的湖面上穿梭似的来往，而那些美丽的碧莲峰、龙头山等等，都直立在湖水中间，或如莲花出水，倒影清翠，或如潜龙抬头，爪尾还隐在碧波深处，那时的桂林风景才真成了人间仙境了。
    社会在变，自然和人的关系在变，人们对于自然美的看法也不得不变。当自然完全消失了对于人的威胁，而人完全消除了对于自然的恐怖的时候，自然对于人必定是更加亲切，更加美丽的了。那时自然将启发人们无尽的诗思，无尽的幻想，而这些诗思和幻想中间，将扫除了旧时代那些阴暗、悲惨和恐怖影子，消灭了出世退隐的思想，代之以焕发的创造和斗争的热情，而这种热情的艺术果实又反过来鼓舞了我们为创造人类更加幸福的生活所进行的劳动。
    编者附记：“桂林山水”是一篇使人读起来有兴趣的游记，又是一篇探讨美学问题的文章，是这一类文章中比较容易读的。近年来在美学问题上一直有争论，在这篇文章中作者提出了自己的看法，这些看法当然是可以讨论的。今天，我们还摘要发表了李可染同志的“漫谈山水画”，这是一篇谈论绘画创作的好文章，尤其是关于山水画意境的创造，作者根据传统的和自己的创作经验，作了精辟的论述。文章内容也关联到对于自然美的看法，有助于在讨论这一问题时作参考。
