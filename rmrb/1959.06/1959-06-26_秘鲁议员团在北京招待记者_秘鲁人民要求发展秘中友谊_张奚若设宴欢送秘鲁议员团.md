Xinhua News Agency, June 25th. The Peruvian parliamentary delegation currently visiting China held a reception for Chinese and foreign journalists in Beijing today. The delegation has visited Beijing, Dalian, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Nanjing, Jinan and other places.

Deputy Ricardo Alcalde said that we and other Latin American countries visited the Soviet Union, China and other countries in order to achieve a result in changing our country's isolated situation. Because it is absurd to be isolated from countries with almost half of the world's population.

Deputy Ernesto More said that we were invited to visit China in order to develop friendly relations between Peru and China. Our parliamentary delegation is so large, and it represents all parties. Everyone has a very good impression of China during the visit. He stated that after they return, the first impact may be in promoting cultural exchanges and economic exchanges between Peru and China.

Deputy Genaro Carnero Checa said that although diplomatic relations have not yet been established between Peru and China, it can be said that the relationship between our two sides has already been established. Checa said that there is currently a strong trend among the Peruvian people demanding the development of Sino-Peruvian friendship, demanding the establishment of diplomatic relations and trade relations with China.

Senator Wilson Solórzano said that this visit allowed him to see the real situation in China and left him with a deep impression of China. He said that he was very moved by the attitude of the Chinese people towards the changes taking place in their country, because "they showed great enthusiasm in their work."

Deputy Jacinto Caseros Pillares said that the Chinese people live happily, everyone is working diligently, and very enthusiastically. China is constantly progressing, there is no slavery or persecution here. He also said: "I have visited some people's communes and have never seen the forced labor that Western news agencies have promoted. I have also visited churches and temples, and all the priests and pastors are very satisfied with their government."

Deputy Carlos Malpica said that China's achievements in agriculture are "heroic achievements that surprise our agriculturalists." He said that China's people's communes "have completed a very important principle of modern agriculture, which creates conditions for the use of mechanized farming on large tracts of land. China has also done a lot of work in water conservancy." Deputy Ernesto More said: "The most profound impression after visiting China is the great enthusiasm of the Chinese people." More said that another profound impression he had was that "China is demanding peace."

Xinhua News Agency, June 25th. Zhang Xiruo, president of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, hosted a banquet tonight to bid farewell to the Peruvian parliamentary delegation.

Zhang Xiruo said in his speech that the Peruvian parliamentary delegation's visit to China has contributed to enhancing the friendship between the Chinese and Peruvian peoples. He proposed a toast to the further development of the friendship between the Chinese and Peruvian peoples.

Deputy Luis Coronado delivered a speech on behalf of the members of the parliamentary delegation. After describing his impressions of visiting China, he said that we are willing to forever maintain the sincere friendship we have established, we must overcome the distance, and we must bring this friendship to the Peruvian people. He finally proposed a toast to Chairman Mao's health, world peace, and the friendship between the Peruvian and Chinese peoples.

    新华社25日讯　正在中国访问的秘鲁议员团今天在北京举行中外记者招待会。议员团曾先后访问了北京、旅大、上海、杭州、南京、济南等地。
    众议员理卡多·阿耳卡德说，我们和其他拉丁美洲国家访问苏联、中国等国家，是为了在改变我们国家的孤立处境方面，获得一个结果。因为同世界上几乎一半人口的国家隔绝是荒谬的。
    众议员埃尔内斯托·莫雷说，我们应邀访问中国是为了发展秘鲁和中国的友好关系。我们议员团人数这样多，又是代表各党派的，大家在访问中国时得到的印象都很好。他表示，他们回去以后，首先可能是在促进秘鲁和中国文化交流和经济往来方面，发生影响。
    众议员赫纳雷·卡内罗·切卡说，虽然秘中两国之间尚未建立外交关系，但可以说我们双方之间的关系早就建立起来了。切卡说，目前在秘鲁人民中间有一股强大的潮流，要求发展秘中友谊，要求同中国建立外交关系和贸易关系。
    参议员维耳松·索洛古伦说，这次访问使他看到了中国的真实情况，对中国有了深刻的印象。他说，中国人民对自己国家发生的变化所持的态度，使他非常感动，因为“他们在工作中表现了巨大的热情”。
    众议员哈辛托·卡塞罗斯·皮拉雷斯说，中国人民生活得很欢乐，所有的人都在勤劳工作，并且很热情。中国正在不断进步，这里没有奴役，也没有迫害。他又说：“我曾经参观了一些人民公社，从来没有见到过西方通讯社所宣传的强迫劳动。我也参观了教堂和庙宇，所有神父和牧师都很满意他们的政府。”
    众议员卡洛斯·马耳皮卡说，中国在农业上的成就是“使我们农业家感到吃惊的英雄业迹。”他说，中国的人民公社“完成了一个现代农业上很重要的原则，它为在大片土地上使用机械耕作创造了条件。中国在水利事业上也做了许多工作。”众议员埃尔内斯托·莫雷说：“访问中国以后得到的最深刻的印象就是中国人民的干劲大。”莫雷说，他得到的另一个深刻的印象是“中国是要求和平的”。
    新华社25日讯　中国人民外交学会会长张奚若今晚设宴欢送秘鲁议员团。
    张奚若在致词中说，秘鲁议员团访问中国为增进中国和秘鲁两国人民的友谊作出了贡献。他提议为中国和秘鲁人民友谊的进一步发展而干杯。
    众议员路易斯·科罗纳多代表议员团的议员们致词，他在叙述访问中国的印象后说道，我们愿意永远保持我们已经建立起来的诚挚友谊，我们要克服距离的遥远，要把这种友谊带给秘鲁人民。他最后提议为毛主席的健康，为世界和平，为秘鲁和中国人民的友谊而干杯。
    出席宴会作陪的有张苏、胡愈之、丁西林、梅龚彬、张友渔、王芸生、朱子奇等。
