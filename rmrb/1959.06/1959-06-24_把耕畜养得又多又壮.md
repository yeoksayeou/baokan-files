    Raise Draft Animals to be Numerous and Strong

    There should be two indicators for developing livestock: one is a large number, and the other is stout and strong. This is also the unity of quantity and quality, and both must be given equal importance and neither can be neglected.

    Increasing animal power is increasing labor power, which is a simple and easy-to-understand principle. According to the general calculation in rural China, one animal power is equivalent to about six labor powers. If China's more than 26,000 people's communes and vast pastoral areas increase by tens of millions of livestock, the country can increase by tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of labor powers. How much will this help to alleviate the current shortage of labor in rural areas! How much will this contribute to promoting the continued leap forward in China's agricultural production! Of course, in addition to raising more, they must also be raised to be strong. At present, many improved and semi-mechanized farm implements in rural China cannot be pulled without strong livestock, or although they can be pulled, they cannot last. In addition, with more stout and strong livestock, animal power can also be rationally allocated. Suibin County, Henan Province, provides a good example in this regard: Since the beginning of spring, Suibin County has launched a "Double Full" (full fat, full pregnancy) campaign, which has greatly reduced the number of livestock with third-class fatness, and the number of livestock with first-class fatness has rapidly increased to 85% of the total number of livestock. As a result, the labor efficiency of each livestock has been greatly improved, and the arrangement of animal power has become more rational. Some people may say: Aren't we going to realize agricultural mechanization? Why develop draft animals? Yes, after the realization of agricultural mechanization, rural labor will not be as tight as it is now. The June 11th fifth page of this newspaper published a message that a Soviet labor hero used agricultural machinery to cultivate 2,225 mu of corn and 1,125 mu of sunflowers in one year. Look, how fascinating this is! However, in China, it will take some time to realize agricultural mechanization. Judging from all aspects, it will take about ten years to realize the majority of agricultural mechanization. Therefore, in the next few years, agricultural production can only focus on improved and semi-mechanized farm implements, and about 90% of the sown area will still be cultivated by animal power. Even after the full implementation of agricultural mechanization in the future, draft animals will still be an indispensable and important auxiliary power source, and also an important source of agricultural fertilizer. A large livestock can accumulate tens of thousands of catties of fertilizer a year, which can be used for three or four mu of land.

    Judging from the experience of many places, to develop livestock, the following two problems must be solved at present.

    The first is the need for an appropriate management system. To do any task well requires a practical and effective management system. Factories have a responsibility system for using machines, and trains have a contract system. Livestock are living beings, which are more difficult to manage than machines, and also require special care and rational use. In terms of management system, rural areas already had a relatively complete system during the period of agricultural cooperativization. After the establishment of people's communes, livestock developed relatively quickly in places where the management system that was effective during the period of cooperativization continued to be used, or where new and reasonable management systems were established; on the contrary, the development of livestock was hindered in places where the original management system was discarded and new management systems were not established. Therefore, people's communes in various places must refer to the management system during the period of cooperativization and formulate a set of management systems that are suitable for the new situation of the communes today. For example, the management and distribution of livestock should be handed over to production teams or production brigades. In terms of the feeding system, Henan Province's "Eight Fixes and Five Awards" system is a good method. The eight fixes are: fixed grass, fixed feed, fixed manure accumulation, fixed breeding, fixed breeders, fixed users, fixed draft animal labor burden, and regular inspection and appraisal. The five awards are: breeding award, reproduction award, survival award, fattening award, and disease-free award. The implementation of these systems can prevent the phenomenon of no one being responsible for management and ensure that livestock are well fed. Farmers have always cherished livestock very much, because they understand that the fatness or abundance of livestock determines the amount of their annual income. Precisely in this way, communes should make efforts from all aspects according to different situations, so that commune members can give full play to greater enthusiasm and responsibility, and manage and raise livestock well.

    Another important issue in feeding is the feed issue. Now it seems that the conditions for solving this problem are even better. On the one hand, a certain amount of feed can be reserved from summer-harvested miscellaneous grains, and many wheat stalks, wheat bran and other by-products that can be used as feed can be collected during the summer harvest as supplementary feed; on the other hand, some scattered land can be used to grow feed. So many scattered pieces of land can amount to tens of thousands of mu in one county and hundreds of thousands of mu in one special zone, which can be used to grow some food crops, oil crops, or some feed. As long as we rely on the masses to find ways, the feed for livestock can be solved.

    In addition, a group of experienced breeders should be equipped as much as possible, and a group of breeding workers should be trained, and breeding stations should be established, and so on.

    Developing animal husbandry is an important condition for developing agriculture. Party committees at all levels must grasp livestock production as they grasp grain, cotton, and oil, and assign a secretary to be responsible for the development of animal husbandry as much as possible. Only in this way can the movement to make livestock fully fat and fully pregnant be fully launched, and animal husbandry can be rapidly developed.

### 把耕畜养得又多又壮

    把耕畜养得又多又壮
    发展牲畜应当有两个指标：一是要数量众多，一是要膘肥体壮。这也是数量和质量的统一，两者必须并重，不可偏废。
    增加畜力就是增加劳力，这是一个很简单易懂的道理。根据我国农村的一般算法，一个畜力约可抵六个劳力。如果我国两万六千多个人民公社和广大牧区增加几千万头牲畜，全国就可以增加成千万以至上亿的劳力。这对缓和目前农村劳动力不足的紧张情况将起多大作用啊！这对促进我国农业生产的继续跃进将有多大贡献啊！当然，养得多，也还要养得壮。目前我国农村中的许多改良农具和半机械化的农具，没有强壮的牲畜，是拉不动的，或者虽然拉动了但是不能持久。此外，膘肥体壮的牲畜多了，也才能合理地调剂畜力。河南睢宾县在这方面提供了一个很好的例子：入春以来，睢宾县展开了一个“双满”（满膘满怀）运动，使三等膘的牲畜大大减少，一等膘的牲畜迅速增加到占牲畜总数的85％，结果，每头牲畜的劳动效率就大大提高，畜力的安排也就更加合理了。可能有人会说：我们不是要实现农业机械化吗？还发展耕畜做什么？是的，实现农业机械化以后，农村劳动力就不会像现在这样紧张了。本报6月11日五版登载了这样一条消息，苏联一位劳动英雄使用农业机械，一年耕种二千二百二十五亩玉蜀黍，一千一百二十五亩向日葵。请看，这是多么引人入胜的事情啊！可是，在我国，要实现农业机械化，还需要有一段时间。从各方面情况来看，在农业中大部实现机械化，大约需要十年左右的时间。因此在最近几年内，农业生产只能以改良农具和半机械化农具为主，90％左右的播种面积还要畜力来耕种。就是将来全部实行农业机械化以后，耕畜仍然是不可缺少的重要辅助动力，而且还是农业肥料的重要来源。一头大牲畜一年可以积几万斤左右肥料，可供三、四亩地施用。
    从许多地方的经验来看，要发展牲畜，目前必须解决以下两个问题。
    首先是需要有适当的管理制度。要作好任何一件事都需要有切实有效的管理制度，工厂里使用机器有专责制，开火车有包乘制。牲畜是有生命的，比机器更难管，也更需要专责照料，合理使用。就管理制度来说，在农业合作化的时期，农村已经有了一套比较完善的制度。成立人民公社以后，凡是继续使用了合作化时期行之有效的管理制度，或者确立了新的合理的管理制度的，牲畜发展就比较快；反之，原来的管理制度被丢掉了，新的管理制度又没有建立起来的地方，牲畜发展就受到妨碍。因之，各地人民公社必须参照合作化时期的管理制度，定出一套适合今天公社新情况的管理制度。例如，牲畜的管理和支配，要交给生产队或生产小队。就饲养制度来说，河南省的“八定五奖”制是一个好的办法。八定是：定草、定料、定积肥、定繁殖、定饲养员、定使役员、定耕畜劳役负担、定期检查评比。五奖是：配种奖、繁殖奖、成活奖、长膘奖、无病奖。推行这些制度就可以制止无人负责管理的现象，保证把牲畜喂好。农民历来对牲畜是非常爱惜的，因为他们了解，牲畜肥不肥，或者牲畜多不多，决定了他们全年收入的多少。正是这样，公社应当根据不同情况，从各方面努力，使社员发挥更大的积极性和责任心，把牲畜管好、养好。
    饲养工作中的另一个重要问题是饲料问题。现在看来，解决这个问题的条件更好了。一方面，可以在夏收杂粮中留出一定数量的饲料，并且趁夏收时机可以收集许多麦秆、麦糠和其他可作饲料的副产品，作补助饲料；另一方面可以利用一部分零星土地种植饲料。这样多的零星土地一个县多达几万亩，一个专区多达几十万亩，种点粮食作物、油料作物，也可以种点饲料。只要依靠群众想办法，牲畜的饲料是可以解决的。
    此外，还应当尽可能配备一批有经验的饲养员和训练一批配种工作人员，建立配种站等等。
    发展畜牧业是发展农业的重要条件。各地党委一定要像抓粮、棉、油一样地抓畜牧生产，并且尽可能抽调一位书记来负责畜牧业发展工作。只有这样，牲畜满膘满怀运动才能全面展开，畜牧业才能得到迅速发展。
