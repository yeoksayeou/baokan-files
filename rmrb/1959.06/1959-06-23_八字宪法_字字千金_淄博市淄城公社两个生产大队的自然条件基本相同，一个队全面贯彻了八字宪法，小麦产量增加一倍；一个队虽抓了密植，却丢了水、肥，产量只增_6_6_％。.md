Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 22nd - In Zibo City's Zicheng People's Commune, Shandong Province, the Huangjiapu and Jiacun production brigades are adjacent with essentially identical production conditions. However, due to differing degrees of implementation of the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agriculture, the effect of increased wheat production this year varies greatly. Historically, Jiacun's wheat yield per mu has generally been slightly higher than Huangjiapu's; however, this year, Huangjiapu has surpassed Jiacun by a significant margin. Huangjiapu's 2,723 mu of wheat saw an average yield per mu increase by 100% compared to last year; while Jiacun's 1,524 mu of wheat only saw a 6.6% increase in yield per mu compared to last year.

The main experience of Huangjiapu Brigade's wheat yield increase this year is the conscientious implementation of the agricultural "Eight-Character Constitution," focusing heavily on "water" and "fertilizer" on the basis of deep plowing and rational close planting, ensuring the wheat was well-fed and watered. They deep-plowed all wheat fields to about one chi (foot) deep, universally applied base fertilizer, and based on the commune's sowing requirements and the brigade's soil quality and sowing time, they sowed 25 jin, 30 jin, or 40 jin per mu respectively, achieving rational close planting. After sowing, they continuously watered five to six times and top-dressed three to five times. They also gave special water and fertilizer applications to third-class seedlings, resulting in widespread yield increases. Jiacun Brigade, although also sowing about 30 jin per mu according to the commune's requirements, did not correspondingly increase water and fertilizer after close planting, so the wheat did not grow very well.

To ensure the densely planted wheat was watered, Huangjiapu Brigade used both old wells and developed new water sources. Around the Spring Festival, they organized a large water conservancy force and, in one go, built 48 large and small canals, drawing water from the Xiaofu River for gravity irrigation, expanding the irrigated land from the original 1,005 mu to more than 2,400 mu. Jiacun Brigade, due to insufficient understanding of the importance of increasing water and fertilizer after close planting of wheat, and harboring the paralyzing thought that "this year has frequent rain, wheat does not need watering," did not focus closely on the work of repairing canals, and also neglected the use of existing canals and wells, resulting in even the 654 mu of wheat fields that could be irrigated by gravity not being universally well-watered.

Huangjiapu Brigade attached great importance to accumulating fertilizer, mobilizing the masses to accumulate and produce fertilizer before planting wheat, and also launched two fertilizer accumulation and production blitz weeks around the Spring Festival. In addition, they also grasped regular fertilizer accumulation and soil fertilizer production, so that this year's wheat fertilizer application exceeded any previous year. Jiacun Brigade neither mobilized the masses to accumulate fertilizer nor established a specialized fertilizer accumulation and production team, resulting in insufficient fertilizer, with 70% of the wheat fields not receiving base fertilizer and very little top-dressing.

The key to Huangjiapu Brigade's good implementation of the agricultural "Eight-Character Constitution" lies in fully mobilizing the masses and jointly planning for increased production with the masses. For example, after wheat sowing, the brigade mobilized the masses to discuss the question of "how to ensure that densely planted wheat grows well." The masses posted more than 5,000 big-character posters in the big blooming and big contending, proposing that the difficulties of fertilizer and water shortage must be overcome and criticizing the fear of difficulties, so the masses could consciously fight for "fertilizer" and "water." Jiacun Production Brigade did not mobilize the masses well, but instead acted simply. For example, some team leaders did not fully understand the issue of close planting, and the brigade cadres said, "You have to plant densely even if you don't understand," so the plan could not be well implemented.

The fact that Huangjiapu and Jiacun Brigades had such different effects on wheat yield increase due to different implementations of the "Eight-Character Constitution" has educated the cadres and commune members of both brigades. Encouraged by the wheat harvest, Huangjiapu Brigade is determined to implement the practical experience it has gained into future wheat management and autumn crop management, changing the old habit of not watering or fertilizing autumn crops. Jiacun Brigade has also expressed its acceptance of the lessons of the wheat season, changing its work style, taking measures, seizing the favorable time in summer, vigorously engaging in fertilizer accumulation and production, and striving for an autumn harvest.

    八字宪法　字字千金
    淄博市淄城公社两个生产大队的自然条件基本相同，一个队全面贯彻了八字宪法，小麦产量增加一倍；一个队虽抓了密植，却丢了水、肥，产量只增6.6％。
    新华社济南22日电　山东省淄博市淄城人民公社的黄家铺和贾村两个生产大队，土地毗邻，生产条件基本相同，但由于对农业“八字宪法”贯彻程度不同，今年小麦增产的效果也就截然两样。历年来，贾村的小麦亩产量一般都比黄家铺稍高；但今年，黄家铺却超过了贾村很多。黄家铺的二千七百二十三亩小麦，平均亩产比去年增加一倍；而贾村的一千五百二十四亩小麦，亩产量只比去年增加6.6％。
    黄家铺大队今年小麦增产的主要经验，是认真地贯彻执行农业“八字宪法”，在深翻和合理密植的基础上，大力抓住“水”和“肥”，保证了小麦吃饱喝足。他们全部麦田都深翻一尺左右，普遍施了底肥，根据公社提出的播种要求和本队的土质、播种时间，分别每亩播种二十五斤、三十斤、四十斤，做到了合理密植。在播种后，连续浇水五次到六次，追肥三次到五次，对三类苗还特别加水加肥，因而获得了普遍增产。贾村大队虽然也按照公社提出的要求，每亩播种三十斤左右，但密植后没有相应地加水加肥，因此小麦生长得并不很好。
    黄家铺大队为了保证密植的小麦浇上水，利用旧井和开发新水源双管齐下。在春节前后，他们组织水利大军，一鼓作气，修成大小渠道四十八条，引孝妇河水自流灌溉，使水浇地由原来的一千零五亩扩大到二千四百多亩。而贾村大队由于对小麦密植后必须加水加肥的重要性认识不足，存有“今年雨水勤，小麦不用浇水”的麻痹思想，因而对整修渠道工作抓得不紧，对现有的渠道和水井也忽视利用，结果就连六百五十四亩可以自流灌溉的麦田也没有普遍浇好水。
    黄家铺大队对积肥非常重视，在种麦前就发动群众积肥造肥，春节前后又开展了两次积肥造肥突击周。此外，还抓紧经常性积肥和土化肥生产，使今年小麦的施肥量超过了以往任何一年。而贾村大队既没有发动群众积肥，也没有建立积肥造肥专业队，以致肥料不足，有70％的麦田没施底肥，追肥也很少。
    黄家铺大队对农业“八字宪法”贯彻得好，关键在于充分发动了群众，与群众共谋增产大计。例如小麦播种后，这个大队发动群众讨论了“如何保证密植的小麦生长好”的问题，群众在大鸣大放中贴出五千多张大字报，提出必须战胜缺肥少水的困难，批判了畏难情绪，因而群众能自觉地为“肥”“水”而战。而贾村生产大队却没有很好地发动群众，相反地简单从事。例如有的小队长对密植问题思想没有完全弄通，大队的干部就说：“你不通也得密”，因而计划不能很好实现。
    黄家铺和贾村两个大队，由于贯彻“八字宪法”不同，小麦增产效果也截然不同的事实，教育了两队的干部和社员群众。黄家铺大队在小麦丰收的鼓舞下，决心将已取得的实践经验，贯彻到今后小麦管理和秋季作物管理中去，改变以往秋季作物不浇水、不施肥的旧习惯。贾村大队也表示接受麦季的教训，转变作风，采取措施，抓住夏季有利时机，大搞积肥造肥，争取秋季丰收。
