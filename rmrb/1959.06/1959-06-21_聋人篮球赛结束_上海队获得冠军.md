Xinhua News Agency, June 20th. The organizing committee of the 1959 National Deaf Men's Basketball Tournament today announced the final results of the finals: Shanghai team won the championship, Beijing team won the second place, Jiangsu team third; the following rankings are Liaoning team, Hubei team, and Guangxi team.
    In the final three games held on the evening of the 19th, two unexpected situations occurred: the Shanghai team, which had already won four consecutive victories, lost to its last opponent, Jiangsu team, with a score of 48 to 49; the Guangxi team, which had already lost four consecutive games, defeated its last opponent, Liaoning team, with a score of 55 to 50. As a result, the Shanghai, Beijing, and Jiangsu teams all had a record of four wins and one loss in five games; the Hubei, Liaoning, and Guangxi teams all had a record of one win and four losses in five games. Therefore, the organizing committee had to use the method of comparing the net scores of each team to determine the final ranking.
    The finals started on June 14th, and the six deaf men's basketball teams held a total of fifteen round-robin matches. Each game attracted thousands of spectators. Some referees who participated in the refereeing work believed that the technical level of each team had improved significantly during this six-day finals. In the first stage of the preliminary competition in the Nanjing competition area, the Jiangsu team lost to the Shanghai team by a difference of 41 points (42 to 83), but in this finals, they fought tenaciously and defeated the Shanghai team with a one-point advantage. Most of the players in the Guangxi team were older and shorter, but they were full of energy and finally won the Liaoning team, which had younger players and taller figures, by a five-point advantage.
    During the finals, the excellent sportsmanship of the players from each team and the accurate shooting skills of many players also left a deep impression on the audience.

    聋人篮球赛结束
    上海队获得冠军
    新华社20日讯　1959年全国聋人男子篮球赛的组织委员会，今天宣布了这次决赛的最后结果：上海队获得冠军，北京队得到亚军，江苏队第三；以下的名次是辽宁队、湖北队、广西队。
    在19日晚上举行的最后三场比赛中，出现了两个出人意料的情况：已经四战四胜的上海队，以四十八比四十九败给了最后一个对手——江苏队；已经四战四败的广西队，以五十五比五十战胜了最后一个对手——辽宁队。这样一来，上海、北京和江苏三个队的战绩，都成了五战四胜一负；湖北、辽宁和广西三个队的战绩，都成了五战一胜四负。于是，组织委员会最后不得不用比较各队净胜得分多少的方法，来排定名次。
    这次决赛从6月14日开始，六个聋人男子篮球队共举行了十五场循环比赛，每次比赛都吸引了上千名观众。参加这次裁判工作的一些裁判员们都认为在这次为时六天的决赛中，各队技术水平有了很明显的提高。江苏队第一阶段在南京竞赛区参加预赛时，曾以四十一分之差（四十二比八十三）败给了上海队，但在这次决赛中，他们顽强奋战的结果，却以一分的优势打败了上海队。广西队大部分队员年纪比较大，个子也比较矮，但他们干劲十足，最后也以五分的优势赢了队员年纪轻、身材高大的辽宁队。
    在决赛期间，各队队员优良的体育道德作风，和许多队员准确的投篮技术，也给观众留下了深刻的印象。
