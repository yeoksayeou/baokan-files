    I heard a comrade say that he recently visited the experimental field of the general branch secretary of a production brigade in a certain commune. The experimental field was about two mu in size and planted with wheat. Half of it grew very well, with tall stalks, large ears, and full grains; the other half was a dense mass, like weeds, some without any ears at all, and some with only a tiny "little bit" of an ear. When he visited, the general branch secretary was very embarrassed, feeling that his experimental field had been planted in this way was unforgivable.
    The story is this: last autumn when sowing wheat, in order to mobilize the commune members to plant densely, the general branch secretary first sowed about one hundred jin of seeds per mu in his own experimental field. At that time, he only knew that dense planting was good, but he didn't know to what extent it should be dense, or what kind of dense planting method to use. After the seedlings emerged, they started to grow really lovely. Soon, the higher-level Party committee discovered that some wheat fields were excessively dense, and in order to prevent lodging and reduced yields, they instructed that the seedlings should be thinned appropriately. However, in the process of thinning the seedlings, the general branch secretary's hand softened as he pulled, and he was unwilling to take action when he saw the seedlings he had personally planted growing so well. At the same time, he had another thought, which was that he was afraid the masses would laugh at him, so he only pulled one side, resulting in the current situation. Now he feels most guilty for not accepting the advice of the higher authorities and for not listening to the opinions of the masses, which resulted in the "spoiling" of the experimental field.
    In fact, in my opinion, this experimental field is a real experimental field. Because it proves several truths to us: first, we must conscientiously implement the instructions of the higher-level Party committee, and we must be good at absorbing the rich experience of the masses, otherwise we will spoil things. Second, the results of the experiment tell us that dense planting must be appropriate, and it must be determined according to soil, climate, variety, and management conditions. Dense planting is a way to increase production, but too much density will also reduce production.
    There are often some people who consciously or unconsciously regard experimental fields as only allowing success and not allowing failure. If they fail, it seems like they have made a big mistake. This view really does not understand the laws of experimentation. Since it is an experiment, it is not doing things according to routine. Everything that is not done according to routine means that there is no precedent to follow and no ready-made experience to learn from, so there is no guarantee of success. For experiments, failure is not only not scary, but also beneficial. If "606" of Western medicine did not have the lessons of the previous six hundred and five failures, the six hundred and sixth would not have succeeded. It can be seen that the experience of success first includes the lessons of many failures before success. Therefore, one cannot be afraid of failure.
    We say that experimentation itself implies two possibilities, success and failure, but we cannot therefore think that experimentation is entirely a matter of chance. On the contrary, experimentation is an activity that has a clear purpose, and it seeks to find ways to achieve this purpose through experimentation. Experimentation is a very serious work, and the plans and measures for carrying out experiments should strive to have a theoretical and practical basis, and should not be reckless and attempt to get by with luck. In the process of conducting experiments, one must study diligently and strive for success. If it fails, one should also find the cause of the failure and summarize the lessons of the failure.
    "Boldly mobilize the masses, and everything should be done through experimentation" is one of the main experiences of the Great Leap Forward. As long as we correctly understand the meaning of experimentation and mobilize more people to conduct experiments, we will break through all difficulties and learn and obtain everything that we do not know and do not have.

### 试验的成功和失败

    试验的成功和失败
    张志平
    听一个同志说，最近他曾参观了某公社一个生产大队总支书记的试验田。试验田约二亩，种的是小麦，一半长的非常好，秸高穗大，籽粒饱满；另一半是密麻麻的一片，和杂草一样，有的根本没有抽穗，有的抽了穗也只有一“小不点”。在他参观的时候，那个总支书记很难为情，觉得自己的试验田种成了这个样子很过意不去。
    事情是这样的：去秋小麦播种时，为了动员社员密植，总支书记首先在自己的试验田里每亩播下了约一百斤种籽。他当时只知道密植好，但究竟该密到什么程度，该怎样个密法，心中没底，也没有去想这些。出苗之后，开始长得真逗人爱。不久，上级党委就发现有些麦田过分密，为了防止倒伏减产，指示要适当进行疏苗。但是总支书记在疏苗的过程中，拔着拔着手就软了，眼看着自己亲自种植的长得这样好的苗苗，怎么也不愿下手，同时还有另外一种想法，就是怕群众笑话自己，于是只拔了一边，结果就成了现在这种样子。现在他觉得过意不去的主要是没有接受上级的劝告，没有倾听群众意见，结果把试验田种“糟”了。
    其实，据我看来，这块试验田倒是一块真正的试验田。因为它向我们证实了几点真理：第一，必须认真地执行上级党的指示，必须善于吸取群众的丰富经验，否则就会把事情办糟。第二，试验的结果告诉了我们，密植必须适当，它要根据土壤、气候、品种，以及管理条件来决定，密植是增产的办法，但太密了也会减产。
    常常有这样一些人，自觉与不自觉地把试验田看成是只许成功，不许失败，失败了就好像犯了什么大错一样。这种看法实在是不懂得试验的规律。既然是试验，就不是按照常规办事。一切不是按照常规办的事，就是没有先例可援，没有现成的经验可以借鉴，因此就没有把握一定成功。对试验来说，失败不仅不可怕，而且也是有益的。西药“六零六”如果没有以前六百零五次失败的教训，第六百零六次也不会成功。可见，成功的经验，首先就包括在成功之前的许多失败的教训在内。因此，就不能怕失败。
    我们说试验本身就意味着成功和失败两种可能，但却不能因此就认为试验完全是一种偶然性的东西。恰恰相反，试验是这样一种活动：它有明确的目的，要通过试验寻找达到这种目的的方法。试验是一种非常严肃的工作，进行试验的计划、措施，都应该力求有理论和实践的依据，不应该是妄作非为企图侥幸。在进行试验的过程中，必须刻苦认真钻研，力求成功。万一失败了，也应该找到失败的原因，总结出失败的教训。
    “放手发动群众，一切经过试验”，是大跃进的主要经验之一。只要我们正确地认识了试验的意义，发动更多的人来进行试验，我们就会突破一切困难，学会和获得一切我们不会的和没有的东西。
