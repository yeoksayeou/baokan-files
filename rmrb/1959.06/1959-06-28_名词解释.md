Glossary

    Intermediate: An intermediate product that has been processed from organic chemical raw materials but has not yet been made into a finished product is called an intermediate. For example, antifebrin is an intermediate for sulfa drugs.
    Derivative: In organic chemistry, a compound made from a parent substance through processing, but still containing the components of the parent substance, is called a derivative of that parent substance. For example, aniline and chlorobenzene are derivatives of benzene.
