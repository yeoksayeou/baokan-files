    A Mocking Edict from New York Hotel, Restaurant, and Theater Owners to the Weather Bureau
    Poem by Chi Bei'ou, Cartoon by Fang Cheng
    
    American newspapers report: New York hotel, restaurant, and theater owners are very annoyed by the New York Weather Bureau's reports of hot summer weather, believing it is greatly detrimental to their business. They have jointly sent a letter to the New York Weather Bureau demanding that it stop daily weather reports or change the wording of the "discomfort index." At the same time, they are attacking the Weather Bureau in newspapers, alleging that it is acting under the instructions of Washington hotel owners. What is this Weather Bureau, daring to report weather that harms people? We have no quarrel with you, why do you insist on ruining our business? You know that tourists are our cash cows, yet you insist on saying that New York summers are unbearably hot. You must have taken money from Washington bosses, deliberately scaring our customers from coming. Immediately stop daily weather reports, or drastically revise the content of the reports. Say it's sunny when it rains, and call it cool even when it's hot. Praise the good climate of New York every day, saying that this is the most comfortable place to spend the summer. Call on leisurely gentlemen and ladies to come quickly, so we can empty their wallets.

    拟纽约旅馆、饭店、戏院老板致气象台的哀的美敦书
    池北偶诗　方成画
    美国报载：纽约旅馆、饭店和戏院的老板对于纽约夏天天气炎热的气象报告十分恼火，认为对他们的生意大为不利，特联合致函纽约气象台，要求停止每天的气象报告，或者改变“不舒服的指标”的提法。同时还通过报纸，攻击气象台是受了华盛顿的饭店老板们的指使。何物气象台，竟敢报告天气把人害。我们和你没什么过不去，干吗硬要砸我们的买卖？明知游客是我们财神爷，却偏说纽约夏天热难耐。准是拿了华盛顿老板的钞票，故意吓唬我们的顾客不敢来。马上停止每天气象的报告，或者把报告的内容大修改。下雨应该说晴天，炎热也要称凉快。天天赞美纽约气候好，这儿消夏避暑最自在。叫有闲的老爷太太们快光临，好让我们掏他们的钱袋。
