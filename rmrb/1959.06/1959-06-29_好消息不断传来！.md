    Good news keeps coming!
    In Shangshui County, Henan Province, the pig industry is developing rapidly. From the communization last year to May of this year, the county sold more than 82,000 pigs to the state, exceeding the state's procurement target by 73%; the "Evergreen" city of Huai'an not only ensures a sufficient quantity of vegetables for the local people but also supports large and medium-sized cities in ten provinces; in the Silian Commune of Songjiang County, Shanghai, in just over three months, the number of chickens, ducks, and geese has increased elevenfold, with an average of 21 poultry per household; in Liushahe Commune, Ningxiang County, Hunan Province, the land of pig breeding, the pig industry is developing rapidly and prosperously... These are all exciting news.
    The Party and the state are very concerned about the lives of the people. Facts have proven that as long as local Party committees strengthen leadership, comprehensively plan production, and uniformly arrange labor, the production of non-staple foods can be quickly restored and developed. We believe that such news will continue to come from all over the country.

    好消息不断传来！
    河南商水县生猪迅速发展，这个县从去年公社化到今年5月份，售给国家的生猪共八万二千多头，超过国家收购任务的73％；“四季常青”的淮安城，不但保证当地人民有充足数量的蔬菜，而且还支援了十个省的大中城市；上海市郊松江县泗联公社仅仅三个多月的时间，鸡鸭鹅的数量猛增十一倍，每户平均有家禽二十一头；在养猪之乡的湖南宁乡县流沙河公社，养猪事业一日千里，欣欣向荣……这都是一些令人兴奋的消息。
    党和国家十分关怀人民的生活。事实证明，只要各地党委加强领导，全面规划生产，统一安排劳力，副食品生产就能迅速恢复和发展。我们相信，这样的消息将从祖国各地不断地传来。
