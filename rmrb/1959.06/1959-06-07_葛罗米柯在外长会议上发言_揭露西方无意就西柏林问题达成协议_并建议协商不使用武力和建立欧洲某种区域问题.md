Xinhua News Agency, Geneva Dispatch, June 6th: The Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference held a formal meeting on the 5th. Prior to the formal meeting, the foreign ministers of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France held some informal talks.

According to newspaper reports, the informal talks mainly discussed the West Berlin issue. In recent days, everyone has been expecting that representatives of Western countries can constructively address the issue, put forward their own pragmatic suggestions, and create possibilities for reaching an agreement. However, did this situation occur in the closed-door meetings? Did the Western ministers demonstrate sincerity in bringing viewpoints closer? It is said that Western countries put forward "new suggestions," but a look at the news published by many Swiss newspapers on the 5th makes it clear that the attitude of the three Western representatives has not progressed at all.
The purpose of the "new suggestions" is to demand recognition of the Western countries' "rights" in West Berlin and to maintain their occupation forces in West Berlin without reducing their numbers. In other words, the Western countries have no intention of abandoning the harsh occupation system in West Berlin, and there is nothing "new" in their attitude.
U.S. Secretary of State Herter's speech at today's meeting clearly confirmed this.

Herter bluntly stated that, in the U.S. view, the West Berlin issue cannot be resolved until Germany is reunified. Herter used stale and familiar words to try to justify a plan to perpetuate the foreign occupation of West Berlin, maintain the system there, so that West Berlin would continue to be a "Cold War" base, a dangerous source of provocation and subversion against the German Democratic Republic and other socialist countries. When Herter spoke about the Soviet Union's proposals on the West Berlin issue, he once again distorted it by saying that the purpose of the Soviet position was to "occupy West Berlin" and to incorporate it into the territory of the German Democratic Republic.

Herter attempted to divert people's attention from the well-known and irrefutable fact that West Berlin has become a dangerous center for espionage and subversive activities. He insisted that East Berlin was carrying out some kind of hostile propaganda and hostile activities.
After Herter spoke, Lloyd continued to speak. He expressed hope for the success of the Geneva Conference. However, he echoed Herter's remarks.
The head of the Soviet delegation, Gromyko, then responded to Herter's speech. He pointed out that the Soviet government's attitude has been clarified in the statements, suggestions, and documents put forward by the Soviet government and its official representatives, so any distorted interpretation of the Soviet government's attitude should be the responsibility of the person making such an interpretation, and the Soviet delegation naturally has nothing to do with it. He pointed out that Herter's words that the Soviet Union intended to annex West Berlin had nothing in common with the intentions and policies of the Soviet government.

Gromyko emphasized that we treat the restricted talks that we often hold between us realistically, and we treat formal meetings like today's in the same way. We regret that not everyone holds the same attitude.
When Gromyko spoke about Herter's remarks about hostile actions and propaganda coming from East Berlin, he pointed out that the Soviet delegation had much more material in this regard to prove the subversive activities carried out by West Berlin against the German Democratic Republic, the Soviet Union, and other countries. The difference is that the Soviet delegation's materials are true. However, bringing out all these materials would lower the level of discussion and would harm the work of the conference. He said that we advocate continuing our work seriously and earnestly.
Gromyko answered the question raised by Lloyd. Lloyd had said that the Soviet delegation might change its attitude towards the "package plan" included in the West's "package plan" and later reiterated, "Unifying East and West Berlin." Gromyko said in response to this: I really find it difficult to understand how much seriousness Mr. Lloyd includes in raising this question to me. Do you expect us to propose extending the occupation system to East Berlin?

Gromyko emphasized that the Soviet government and the Soviet delegation are now and will continue to be very willing to promote the reaching of an agreement at this conference on the various issues under discussion, including the Berlin issue. It is doubtful whether the representatives of Western countries are really working hard to do this and are really taking corresponding measures for this purpose.
Gromyko finally raised two questions to the representatives of the United States and Britain, hoping to better understand the attitude of Western countries in this regard. Gromyko pointed out that the Western suggestion mentioned the possibility of issuing a declaration or a statement stipulating agreement not to use force and to resolve disputes between major powers through peaceful means and through corresponding negotiations. Can the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and France make corresponding explanations on this proposition, and perhaps there is a possibility of reaching some agreement on this issue.
Gromyko continued to point out that the second question is related to the establishment of some regional issue in Europe. The participants of this conference have mentioned such a proposition from different angles, but this proposition has not been developed and affirmed. Can the foreign ministers of the three Western countries talk about more specific ideas on this issue. If it is inconvenient now for some reason, we are willing to listen to these Western ideas at any other time that is suitable for the West.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of the German Democratic Republic, Bolz, then spoke. He said that Gromyko mentioned two questions today, the solution of which will produce broader results.
Bolz mentioned the issue of non-use of force in resolving international disputes. He pointed out that the German Democratic Republic is willing to make every effort to ease the relations between the two Germanys, so it strives for negotiations between the governments of the two Germanys in order to conclude an agreement stipulating the non-use of force in the relations between the two sides. He pointed out that the First Deputy Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, Ulbricht, wrote to West German Chancellor Adenauer suggesting the conclusion of a non-aggression treaty between the two Germanys.

Then the West German representative Grewe made a brief speech, in which he again rejected the proposal for negotiations between the two Germanys.

### 葛罗米柯在外长会议上发言  揭露西方无意就西柏林问题达成协议  并建议协商不使用武力和建立欧洲某种区域问题

    葛罗米柯在外长会议上发言
    揭露西方无意就西柏林问题达成协议
    并建议协商不使用武力和建立欧洲某种区域问题
    据新华社6日讯　据塔斯社日内瓦讯：日内瓦外长会议5日举行正式会议。在举行正式会议以前，苏美英法四国外长进行了一些非正式会谈。
    据报纸报道，非正式会谈主要讨论了西柏林问题。这些天来，大家都在期待着西方国家代表能够建设性地对待问题，提出自己的实事求是的建议，为达成协议创造可能性。但是，在秘密会议上是否出现了这种情况呢？西方的部长们是否表现了使观点接近的诚意呢？据说，西方国家提出了“新建议”，然而只要看一看许多瑞士报纸5日发表的消息就可以明白，西方三国代表的态度丝毫没有进展，
  “新建议”的目的在于要求承认西方国家在西柏林的“权利”，并且在不减少人数的情况下保持它们在西柏林的占领军。换句话说，西方国家丝毫不打算放弃在西柏林的严酷的占领制度，在它们的态度中没有任何“新东西”。
    美国国务卿赫脱在今天会议上的发言明明白白地证实了这一点。
    赫脱直言不讳地说，照美国的看法，西柏林问题在德国重新统一之前是无法解决的。赫脱用陈腐的、大家早已熟悉的言词企图为这样一个计划辩解，即：外国使对西柏林的占领永久化，保持那里的制度，以便使西柏林今后仍然成为反对德意志民主共和国和其他社会主义国家的“冷战”基地，挑衅和颠覆活动的危险的策源地。赫脱谈到苏联关于西柏林问题的建议时，他再一次歪曲说，苏联立场的目的是打算“占领西柏林”和打算把它并入德意志民主共和国领土。
    赫脱企图转移人们对这样一个众所周知的、无可反驳的事实的注意，就是西柏林已经成为间谍颠覆活动的危险的中心。他硬说，东柏林方面在执行着某种敌对的宣传和敌对活动。
    赫脱发言后，劳埃德接着发言。他表示希望日内瓦会议圆满成功。但是，他附和赫脱的说法。
    苏联代表团团长葛罗米柯接着回答赫脱的发言。他指出，苏联政府的态度都已在苏联政府和它的正式代表所提出的声明、建议和文件中阐明，因此任何对苏联政府态度所作的歪曲解释都应该由作这种解释的人负责，苏联代表团对此自然没有任何关系。他指出，赫脱所谓苏联打算吞并西柏林的话，同苏联政府的意图和政策毫无相同之处。
    葛罗米柯强调说，我们实事求是地对待我们之间常常举行的限制性会谈，而且也用同样的态度对待像今天这样的正式会议。我们感到遗憾的是，并非所有人都抱着同样的态度。
    葛罗米柯谈到赫脱所谓有敌对行动和宣传来自东柏林的话，他指出，在这方面苏联代表团掌握着多得多的材料可以证明西柏林对德意志民主共和国、苏联和其他一些国家进行的颠覆活动。而不同的是，苏联代表团的这些材料是真的。但是，如果搬出所有这些材料，就会降低讨论的水平，会损害会议的工作。他说，我们主张认真而严肃地继续进行我们的工作。
    葛罗米柯答复了劳埃德提出的问题。劳埃德曾说苏联代表团可能改变对待西方的“一揽子计划”中所包括的以及后来重申的“统一东西柏林”计划的态度。葛罗米柯针对这一点说：劳埃德先生对我提出这个问题究竟包含多少认真的程度，真使我感到费解。难道你希望我们提出把占领制度扩大到东柏林的问题吗？
    葛罗米柯着重指出，苏联政府和苏联代表团现在和今后都非常愿意促进这次会议就所讨论的各种问题，其中也包括柏林问题达成协议。而西方国家代表是否也真正在努力这样做，真正在为此而采取相应的措施，是值得怀疑的。
    葛罗米柯最后向美英两国代表提出两个问题，希望更充分地了解西方国家在这方面的态度。葛罗米柯指出，西方建议中提到可能发表一项宣言或一项声明来规定同意不使用武力、通过和平办法、通过相应的谈判来解决大国之间的争端。美英法的外长是否可以对这一主张作出相应的解释，也许就这一问题有达成某种协议的可能。
    葛罗米柯继续指出，第二个问题是有关建立欧洲的某种区域的问题，这次会议的参加者从不同的角度提到了这样一个主张，但是这个主张一直没有得到发展和肯定。西方三国外长是否可以谈谈对这个问题的比较具体的想法。如果由于某些理由现在还不便的话，我们愿意在适合西方的任何其他时间听取西方这些想法。
    德意志民主共和国外交部长博尔茨接着发言。他说。葛罗米柯今天提到了两个问题，这两个问题的解决将会产生比较广泛的结果。
    博尔茨提到在解决国际争端中不使用武力的问题，他指出，德意志民主共和国愿意尽一切努力使两个德国之间的关系缓和下来，因此它争取两个德国的政府进行谈判，以求缔结一项协定规定在双方的关系中不使用武力。他指出，德意志民主共和国第一副总理乌布利希写给西德总理阿登纳的信里建议在两个德国之间缔结互不侵犯条约。
    接着西德代表格雷韦作了简短发言，他再次拒绝了关于两个德国之间进行谈判的建议。
