    Advanced Models and Mass Movements
    Lu Dadong, Secretary of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China
    Fully mobilizing the masses and launching mass movements are fundamental issues for factories and mines in implementing the Party's general line for socialist construction. The Great Leap Forward of last year and the continued leap forward this year have further proven that only by launching mass movements on a large scale and conscientiously implementing the Party's mass line can we achieve more, faster, better, and more economical results. In 1958, Chongqing's total industrial output value increased by 72.79% compared to 1957. This year, the city's industrial production, whether in steel, coal, or machinery manufacturing, will increase compared to last year. To achieve the task of continued leap forward without increasing manpower, the fundamental method is to comprehensively and deeply carry out the mass movement of increasing production and practicing economy, to vigorously promote technological revolution, and to continuously improve labor productivity. Therefore, further implementing the policy of combining centralized leadership with large-scale mass movements is even more important.
    Establishing Models to Lead the Overall Situation
    Grasping the advanced, establishing models, and vigorously promoting advanced experiences are important methods for carrying out mass movements in depth and for a long time on the industrial front. At any time and in any position, there is a distinction between advanced, intermediate, and backward; only by grasping the advanced, while encouraging the backward to catch up with the advanced, and driving the intermediate forward together, can a real mass movement be formed. In the past few years, because we have basically used this leadership method, advanced figures have been relatively active and the ranks of advanced producers have continued to expand along with the continuous development of production on the industrial front. Especially during the Great Leap Forward, the breakthrough of every difficulty and the improvement of production were achieved only after the Party pointed out the direction, through grasping the advanced, establishing models, and vigorously summarizing and promoting advanced experiences. In the early stage of the Great Leap Forward last year, we first established the advanced models of Huang Rongchang and Liao Shigang throughout the city, who were persistent in research and continuous in creation. These two red flags vigorously promoted the development of the technological innovation movement, and a large number of advanced figures like Liao Shigang emerged. In Chongqing Construction Machine Tool Factory alone, within less than a month, more than six hundred heroic figures like Liao Shigang appeared, rushing ahead of time and striving to overfulfill the leap forward plan. Throughout the year, this factory had 1,907 workers who completed the workload equivalent to five years. From the perspective of factories and mines throughout the city, a total of more than 6,300 advanced collectives and more than 174,000 advanced individuals emerged last year. With such a group of advanced elements taking the lead on the industrial production front, and at the same time, everyone paying attention to helping and organizing the backward to continuously catch up with the advanced, it is a huge impetus for those in an intermediate state. In this way, the backward catch up with the advanced, prompting the advanced to become more advanced. This cycle continues, deepening and improving step by step. This is an extremely important factor for us to achieve continuous leap forward in production.
    Moving Towards Large-Area High Yield
    Since the beginning of this year, especially after the vigorous development of the mass movement for increasing production and practicing economy centered on technological innovation and technological revolution in the second quarter, all factories and mining enterprises in the city have paid attention to grasping the central link of inserting red flags and establishing models, and vigorously promoting advanced experiences, so that the mass movement has entered a new stage of sustained development and depth. The significant features of this stage are: striving for both high yield and high quality, continuously improving at an advanced level, promoting the majority of employees to further engage in technological innovation and technological revolution, actively learning from the advanced and catching up with the advanced, and turning the high yield of a few people into large-area high yield.
    At that time, many factories and mines strengthened the leadership in promoting advanced experiences, and adopted the method of establishing models at all levels, establishing models for each process, and combining individual models with collective models, inserting red flags everywhere, so that the employees had concrete examples to learn from and catch up with. On the basis of the "one-dragon" production collaboration, Chongqing Iron and Steel Plant further promoted the method of "one-dragon" establishing models, "one-dragon" summarizing and promoting advanced experiences, taking the steelmaking furnace as the leader, comprehensively summarizing and promoting advanced experiences and comprehensively establishing production models from various types of work and various departments; there are not only steelmaking models and experiences, but also models and experiences in various aspects such as dispatchers, train drivers, and duty directors. With these models and advanced experiences, the active factors in all links of factories and mining enterprises have been mobilized. At present, most factories and mining units have established or improved mass organizations for summarizing and promoting advanced experiences, formulated combat plans like fighting a war, and, focusing on the key problems existing in production, lined up major advanced experiences, formulated plans, and set deadlines for promotion, striving to turn the advanced level into the social level relatively quickly.
    This large-scale grasping of the advanced, establishing of models, and promotion of advanced experiences, quickly turning the advanced production level of a few people into the social production level, has had an immediate effect on improving labor productivity. Judging from the situation of various factories and mines in Chongqing, under the same conditions, there is a big difference between the advanced production level and the general production level. For example, in terms of steel production, the smelting time of large open-hearth furnaces in the Chongqing Iron and Steel Company's Open-Hearth Furnace Plant used to be ten to eleven hours. Recently, records of smelting a furnace of steel in seven minutes and thirty seconds have continuously appeared. If this can be stabilized, the output can be greatly increased. Another example is the life of converters. Some factories have reached fifty to sixty furnaces, and the highest has reached seventy-odd furnaces; but at present, most furnaces are still at around thirty furnaces. If all the converters are increased to fifty furnaces, the steel output can be greatly increased. In terms of technical level, many workers have created a large number of advanced experiences, and some can complete the annual workload in a few days, while some still operate according to the old methods. This situation shows that the potential of factories and mining enterprises is very great. As long as we seriously grasp the advanced, lead the backward, and vigorously promote advanced experiences, and continuously improve the backward level to the advanced level, production can be doubled. Practice has proved that this is indeed the case. For example, since May, several steel plants have vigorously promoted new methods of sulfur removal and rapid steelmaking and other major advanced experiences. In the first half of the month, the average daily steel output increased by 20.24% compared to the average daily output in April, and the quality has also improved. Other departments of machinery, infrastructure construction, transportation, etc., have also achieved significant results in promoting advanced experiences. Before people realize it, advanced factors always look at problems from a conservative and backward perspective, only seeing various difficulties and lacking motivation; once their thinking is improved, they feel that without grasping the advanced, there is no strength to overcome backwardness. By seriously grasping the advanced, methods are available, confidence is enhanced, and motivation is sufficient. Many factories and mines have seen a lively situation of vigorously summarizing and promoting advanced experiences and extensively establishing models.
    Several Important Links
    Grasping the advanced, establishing models, and vigorously summarizing and promoting advanced experiences is also a process of concentrating the wisdom and experience of the masses, adhering to it, and continuously summarizing and improving it. However, many comrades often fail to see the tremendous role of summarizing and upgrading the masses' own things in enriching the leadership and guiding the mass movement. Especially when new things begin to appear, they are often incomplete, and therefore are often not valued or recognized. It takes a hard struggle, even multiple failures, to achieve perfection. Even if some attach importance to it, they often tend to regard grasping the advanced and establishing models as a measure and means to solve a certain current problem, and are unwilling to patiently and meticulously carry out the work of cultivation and consolidation for a long time, so many advanced experiences are not easy to consolidate, improve, and continue to develop. In order to carry out the work of grasping the advanced, establishing models, and vigorously summarizing and promoting advanced experiences very well, we mainly focused on the following links in carrying out this work:
    1. Regard this work as an important political and ideological work and organizational work of the Party. First of all, the leadership of the Party at all levels must attach importance to the advanced and have a solid work style of going deep into reality and going deep into the masses. From this period of practice, we have deeply realized that with advanced models, not only can the masses spur themselves on to move towards higher goals, but also only in this way can leaders build their work on the basis of the advanced. Only with advanced thinking can there be sufficient motivation to stand at the forefront of the mass movement and drive the masses forward.
    2. Conduct timely summaries and evaluations, and conscientiously promote advanced experiences. The process of summarizing, evaluating, and promoting advanced experiences is the process of promoting the advanced, encouraging the backward to catch up with the advanced, thereby continuously improving and developing advanced experiences. Summarizing, evaluating, and promoting advanced experiences must adhere to the principle of combining leadership with the masses and following the mass line. Only by using the mass line to evaluate and summarize can advanced things have a mass base and play a role in motivating and organizing the masses to strive for progress and liberating thinking and criticizing conservatism; only in this way can the mass movement continue to develop, with one wave higher than another. In the work of evaluating and summarizing the advanced, it is necessary to grasp both the big and the small, both the comprehensive and the specialized; it is necessary to establish both individual models and collective models, so as to play a role in comprehensively promoting production and obtaining large-area harvests. In terms of the promotion of advanced experiences, in addition to adopting a variety of forms such as holding on-site meetings, conducting on-site demonstrations, organizing advanced experience seeding teams, and advanced experience training classes, large-scale factories and mines have united to establish advanced experience seeding networks and cooperation areas. These are all good ways newly emerging in the large-scale promotion of advanced experiences.
    3. Strengthen the training and education of advanced producers, and help them continuously improve their ideological and technical levels. On the one hand, it is necessary to make them timely understand the current situation and tasks, give them directions and topics, and help them establish a firm mass viewpoint and the thinking of continuous progress; on the other hand, it is necessary to place them among the masses, so that they can continuously move forward under the leadership of the Party and with the help of the masses. The growth of each advanced producer almost has such a process: with some achievements, they become complacent; continuously educating them through concrete examples makes them realize that it is difficult for any creation to appear without the Party and the masses, so that they can always maintain full revolutionary enthusiasm and prevent arrogance.
    4. Properly arranging the activities of advanced producers and ensuring that they can continuously innovate technology in production positions is also an important link in cultivating advanced producers. The role of advanced producers is mainly to continuously create advanced examples and set an example; therefore, it is necessary to insist on letting them not be separated from the production position and cultivate them in the production group. In the past, we did not pay enough attention to this issue, so that advanced producers undertook more non-productive activities, which resulted in scattered energy and affected the growth of advanced figures. Since last year, we have paid attention to this issue, and in addition to necessary activities, in daily production, we have given them sufficient time and opportunities to study technology and better play an advanced role.
    At present, the vigorous movement for increasing production and practicing economy on the industrial front in Chongqing is constantly deepening. In order to ensure the successful completion of the various production tasks centered on steel in the city this year, we must continue to adhere to and implement the Party's policy of combining centralized leadership with large-scale mass movements, vigorously grasp the advanced, and vigorously promote advanced experiences. The practice of the Great Leap Forward proves that the working masses are the most revolutionary factor in production, and the production potential of existing factories and mining enterprises is very large. As long as we conscientiously organize and promote advanced experiences, vigorously engage in technological innovation and technological revolution, and turn the level of advanced producers into the production level of the whole society, we can continuously improve labor productivity, and production can continuously leap forward and leap forward again.

    先进标兵和群众运动
    中共重庆市委书记　鲁大东
    充分发动群众，大搞群众运动，是厂矿企业贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线的一个根本问题。去年大跃进和今年的继续跃进，更证明了只有大搞群众运动，认真贯彻党的群众路线，才能做到多快好省。1958年重庆市工业生产总值比1957年增长72.79％。今年全市工业生产无论是钢铁、煤炭、机械制造等，都将比去年有所增长。要在不增加人力的情况下实现继续跃进的任务，根本的方法就是全面、深入地开展增产节约的群众运动，大闹技术革命，不断提高劳动生产率。因此，进一步地贯彻集中领导与大搞群众运动相结合的方针，就更加显得重要了。
    立标兵　带全局
    抓先进，立标兵，大力推广先进经验，这是工业战线上深入、持久地开展群众运动的重要方法。任何时候，任何岗位，都有先进、中间、落后之分；只有抓住先进，同时鼓励落后赶上先进，并带动中间一道前进，才能形成真正的群众运动。几年来，由于我们基本上运用了这一领导方法，所以在工业战线上，与生产不断发展的同时，先进人物比较活跃，先进生产者的队伍也不断扩大。尤其在大跃进中，每一道难关的攻破和生产的提高，无一不是在党指出方向之后，通过抓先进，立标兵，大力总结、推广先进经验以后取得辉煌战果的。去年大跃进初期，我们在全市范围内首先树立了顽强钻研和不断创造的先进典型——黄荣昌、廖世刚两面红旗，有力地推动了技术革新运动的发展，涌现了大批廖世刚式的先进人物。单是重庆建设机床厂，在为时不到一个月的时间内，就出现了六百多个像廖世刚那样抢在时间前头、力争超额完成跃进计划的英雄人物。全年这个厂有一千九百零七个工人，完成了相当于五年的工作量。从全市厂矿看来，去年总共出现先进集体六千三百多个，先进个人达十七万四千多人。工业生产战线有了这样一批先进分子带头；同时，大家又注意帮助、组织落后的不断赶上先进，对处于中间状态的人就是一个巨大的推动。这样，落后的赶上先进，促使先进的更加先进。如此循环不已，步步深入、提高。这是我们能够实现生产不断跃进的一个极为重要的因素。
    向大面积丰产前进
    今年以来，特别是第二季度以技术革新、技术革命为中心的增产节约运动轰轰烈烈展开以后，全市各厂矿企业都注意抓紧了插红旗、立标兵，大力推广先进经验这一中心环节，使群众运动进入持久并向纵深发展的新阶段。这个阶段的显著特点是：既要高产，又要优质，在先进的水平上不断提高，促进广大职工进一步大搞技术革新和技术革命，积极地学先进、赶先进，把少数人的高产变为大面积丰产。
    当时，不少厂矿都加强了推广先进经验的领导，采取层层立标兵、道道工序立标兵以及个人标兵和集体标兵相结合的办法，遍插红旗，使职工群众有了具体的学习、追赶的榜样。重庆钢铁厂在“一条龙”生产协作的基础上，进一步推行了“一条龙”立标兵、“一条龙”总结、推广先进经验的方法，以炼钢炉为龙头，从各个工种、各个部门，全面的总结、推广先进经验，全面的树立生产标兵；不仅有炼钢的标兵和经验，而且有调度员、行车司机、值班主任等各方面的标兵和经验。有了这些标兵和先进经验，这就把厂矿企业各个环节的积极因素调动起来了。目前，大部分厂矿单位都建立或健全了群众性的总结、推广先进经验的组织机构，像打仗一样，订出作战计划，针对生产上存在的关键问题，把重大先进经验进行排队，定出规划，限期推广，争取比较快地使先进水平变成社会水平。
    这种大规模的抓先进、立标兵、推广先进经验，把少数人的先进生产水平迅速变为社会生产水平，对提高劳动生产率起了立竿见影的作用。从重庆市各厂矿的情况来看，在同样的条件下，先进生产水平与一般生产水平相差很大。例如钢铁生产方面，重庆钢铁公司平炉厂大平炉冶炼时间，过去是十到十一小时，最近连续出现了七点三十分钟炼一炉钢的纪录，如果稳定下来，产量就可大大提高。又如转炉的寿命，有的厂已达到五十到六十炉，最高的达到七十几炉；但目前多数炉子还停留在三十炉左右，如果所有的转炉都提高到五十炉，那么钢产量就可大大增加。在技术水平方面，不少工人创造了大量先进经验，有的几天就能完成全年的工作量，而有一些人仍按老一套的办法操作。这种情况说明，厂矿企业的潜力很大，只要认真抓先进、带落后，大力推广先进经验，不断把落后水平提高到先进水平，生产就可以成倍增加。实践证明也确实是这样。如几个钢厂，5月份以来因为狠狠地推广了新的攻硫方法和快速炼钢等重大先进经验，上半月钢的平均日产量就比4月份平均日产量增长了20.24％，质量提高了。其他机械、基建、交通等部门推广先进经验，也都取得重大的效果。先进因素，当人们还没觉察到的时候，总是从保守、落后的方面来看问题，只看到种种困难，干劲不足；一旦思想提高了，就感觉到不抓先进就没有力量克服落后。认真抓了先进，办法也就有了，信心也就增强了，干劲也足了，很多厂矿就出现了大张旗鼓总结、推广先进经验和广泛树立标兵的生动局面。
    几个重要环节
    抓先进、立标兵、大力总结、推广先进经验，也就是把群众智慧、经验集中起来，坚持下去，不断总结、提高的过程。但是，许多同志往往看不到这种把群众自己的东西总结、提升起来，对于丰富领导、指导群众运动的巨大作用。特别是新的事物开始出现的时候，往往是不完整的，因而常常是不为人所重视和承认。经过一番艰苦斗争，甚至多次失败，才能臻于完善。有的即使重视，也往往容易把抓先进、立标兵作为一种解决当前某一问题的措施和手段，而不肯耐心、细致地长期做培养和巩固的工作，所以不少先进经验就不容易巩固、提高，继续发展。为了把抓先进、立标兵，大力总结、推广先进经验的工作开展得很好，我们在进行这一工作中主要抓了以下几个环节：
    一、把这项工作作为党的一项重要的政治思想工作和组织工作。首先，各级党的领导要重视先进，具有深入实际、深入群众的踏实作风。从这一段的实践中，我们深刻体会到，有了先进典型，不仅群众能够鞭策自己向更高的目标前进，同时，也只有这样，领导者才能把自己的工作建立在先进的基础上。只有思想先进，才会有充足的干劲，站在群众运动前头，带动群众前进。
    二、及时进行总结、评比，认真推广先进经验。总结、评比和推广先进经验的过程，就是发扬先进，鼓励落后赶上先进，从而使先进经验不断提高、发展的过程。总结、评比和推广先进经验必须坚持领导与群众结合的原则，走群众路线。只有运用群众路线的评比、总结，先进事物才有群众基础，才能起到激励、组织群众力争上游和解放思想、批判保守的作用；也只有这样，群众运动才能不断向前发展，一浪高过一浪。在评比、总结先进的工作中，既要抓大的，也要抓小的；既要抓全面的，也要抓专题的；既要树立个人标兵，也要树立集体标兵，这样才能起到全面推动生产的作用，获得大面积丰收。在先进经验的推广方面，除了采取开现场会议，进行现场表演、组织先进经验播种队、以及先进经验训练班等多种多样的形式外，大型厂矿联合起来，建立先进经验播种网、协作区，这都是大规模推广先进经验
  中新出现的良好方式。
    三、加强对先进生产者的培养和教育，帮助他们不断地提高思想水平和技术水平。一方面要使他们及时了解当前的形势和任务，给他们指方向、出题目，帮助他们树立牢固的群众观点和不断上进的思想；另方面，要把他们置于群众之中，使其在党的领导和群众的帮助下，不断前进。每一个先进生产者的成长差不多都有这样一个过程：有了点成绩，就自满；不断通过具体事例进行教育，使其认识离开党和群众是什么创造也很难出现，这样就能使他们经常保持饱满的革命热情，防止骄傲情绪。
    四、妥善安排先进生产者的活动，保证他们能够在生产岗位上不断革新技术，也是培养先进生产者的一个重要环节。先进生产者的作用，主要是不断创造先进的范例，树立榜样；因此，必须坚持让他们不脱离生产岗位，在生产小组培养。过去我们对这个问题注意得不够，使先进生产者担负非生产性的活动多，结果分散了精力，影响了先进人物的成长。去年以来，注意了这个问题，除了必要的活动以外，在日常生产中使他们有充裕时间和机会研究技术，更好地发挥先进的作用。
    目前，重庆市工业战线上轰轰烈烈的增产节约运动正在不断深入。为了确保本市今年以钢铁为中心的各项生产任务的胜利完成，我们必须继续坚持、贯彻党的集中领导和大搞群众运动相结合的方针，大抓先进，大力推广先进经验。大跃进的实践证明：工人群众是生产中最革命的因素，现有厂矿企业的生产潜力是很大的，只要我们认真的组织、推广先进经验，大搞技术革新、技术革命，把先进生产者的水平变成全社会的生产水平，就能不断提高劳动生产率，生产就能不断地跃进再跃进。
