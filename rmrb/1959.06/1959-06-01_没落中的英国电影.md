The Decline of British Cinema
Li Yichuan

In the “end of the world” caused by the fallout of radioactive materials, ghosts are rampant everywhere; a group of demons invade the earth from space; a bizarre tree devours young girls one after another; living people are placed in hydraulic presses, slowly crushed, with blood flowing… These are all films that once caused a sensation in the United States and Britain.

In Britain, there are fewer and fewer movies worth watching. The screens are flooded with murder, horror, crime, and pornography, and most of them are imported from the United States. More than 70% of the films currently showing come from the United States, and even many British-made films often have American directors or stars participating.

In order to anesthetize and corrupt the people, thereby consolidating the capitalist system, the bizarre content and open moral depravity of British films have reached their peak. Ordinary murder, horror, and pornographic films have lost their "stimulating" effect, and fewer and fewer people are watching movies. In order to strengthen this "stimulation" and attract audiences, the number of such horror films as mentioned above is increasing year by year. Nine were shown in 1953, twelve in 1954, nineteen in 1956, and as many as thirty in 1957, while thirty were shown in the first ten months of 1958 alone. Each film competes to surpass the previous one in terms of horror. Defenders of the capitalist system openly come out to sponsor and encourage such films. John Trevelyan, secretary of the British Board of Film Censors, believes that such films are "beneficial." He said: "Someone told me that young people unconsciously use this kind of film to test their courage. Because they have not experienced the last world war, they do not know whether they can withstand the next war. It seems to me that this will be one of the ways they can put themselves in terror and discover how they react." Robert Siodmak, director of many gangster films, said in the June issue of "Films and Filming" magazine: "Why do I like directing gangster films? It's easy to answer. Because these films contain strong emotions: love, hatred, jealousy, and often premeditated murder. In fact, they contain the basic elements of life."

Pornographic films are also developing to extremes: films showing thighs and breasts have lost their appeal, replaced by nude films. Several nude films are being shown simultaneously in West London, and the entrances of the theaters are plastered with huge photos of nude women. At the entrance of a cinema on Oxford Street, the most prosperous street in London, there is such an advertisement with a color-printed nude woman image, with the following words printed below:

	“Britain’s First Nude Film:
		Paradise for Nudists
		Exciting New Stars”

For several months, the box office rate of the "Britain's First" nude film has remained at the highest level. Then the second and third nude films were also rushed to be produced. The third film was approved by the censor under the "sponsorship" of a lord.

In contrast, progressive films are squeezed out, discriminated against, and banned. They rarely have the opportunity to meet the audience. This is primarily because the British film industry—from production and distribution to screening—is completely controlled by a few monopoly capitalists. These monopoly groups also have very close relations with American capital, and they have become the most powerful and strongest disseminators of the "American way of life." The Rank Organisation is the largest monopoly group in British film production, distribution, and screening, and even monopolizes the production of film equipment. It currently has nearly four hundred cinemas in Britain and has close ties with three major American film companies; the second is Associated British Picture Corporation (37% of the shares are held by the United States), which also has nearly four hundred cinemas; another is British Lion Films, mainly engaged in production and distribution. These three groups control the British film industry. For example, in terms of screening, two-thirds of the important cinemas in London are owned by these three groups. It is difficult for some small and medium-sized film companies to survive. A film must obtain the consent of these monopoly groups before it can be produced. If these groups believe that the film has "no entertainment value," then the film is tantamount to a "death sentence" and it is difficult to put it into production; even if it is reluctantly produced, it is difficult to find a place to screen it; even if a place to screen it is found, it is impossible to recover the production costs of the film. Big monopoly bosses actually decide what should be shown and what should not be shown. The bourgeoisie's so-called "freedom" is actually the freedom of monopoly capitalists.

In addition to this restriction, there is also the restriction of the British government's film censorship system.

Strangely enough, the British film censorship standards are not explicitly stipulated, but are "determined based on the merits of each film." Who decides these merits? The censor. The current chief censor is former Undersecretary of the Home Office, Sidney Harris. The film "Teuton Sword," which exposes former fascist head and current Commander-in-Chief of the Central European Army of the North Atlantic Group, Speidel, was rejected. But if such a film is considered by the government to have propaganda value, it can be shown. A report by the British Political and Economic Planning group stated: "Whether this system of dictatorial and national tyranny is good depends on one's political beliefs."

The anti-popular nature of bourgeois films, the shoddy production of films, coupled with the competition from television, have led to the decline of British cinema. "The crisis in the film industry!" "The Rank Organisation will close more cinemas!" "The decline in film production over the past year is the worst year in film history!" These are often news published in British newspapers in large headlines. In the four years from 1954 to 1957, more than three hundred and forty cinemas "closed down." Last year was even more bleak, with as many as two hundred and fifty cinemas closing. That is to say, in the past five years, Britain has closed more than one-tenth of its entire cinemas. The rate of audience attendance has declined rapidly, and the rate of decline has been even more alarming in the past two or three years. The number of moviegoers in 1958 was only half of that in 1948. Film production has also decreased, with 141 produced in 1958 and only 117 planned for this year. Personnel have been drastically reduced: Rank's Pinewood Studios in London had contracts to produce films with one hundred and twelve film stars during its most prosperous period after the war. This was reduced to forty people in 1957, and then to twenty-five people in 1958. According to the Actors' Equity Association, "a quarter of the actors in the country are unemployed because many film studios and theaters across the country have closed down."

No matter what methods the bourgeoisie uses, whether it is nude films or horror films, it cannot fundamentally reverse the decline of the film industry, because the roots of the capitalist system have withered, and where can the leaves still flourish!

    没落中的英国电影
    李一川
    在放射性物质下落造成的“世界末日”中，鬼怪到处横行；一群恶魔，从空间侵入了地球；一棵古怪的树，一个又一个地吞噬着妙龄少女；活人被放在水压机中，慢慢碾碎，鲜血横流……。这些都是在美国和英国曾经轰动一时的影片。
    在英国，能够使人看下去的电影是愈来愈少了。泛滥在银幕上的尽是些谋杀、恐怖、犯罪和色情片，并且大部分都是从美国输入的。现在上演电影的70％以上就来自美国，即使英国摄制的许多片子，也常常有美国的导演或明星参加。
    为了麻醉和腐蚀人民，从而巩固资本主义制度，英国影片内容的离奇古怪和公开地败坏道德，已达到登峰造极的程度。一般的谋杀、恐怖、色情片，已失去“刺激”作用，看电影的人愈来愈少了。为了加强这种“刺激”性，吸引观众，像上面提到过的那种恐怖片的放映数，逐年在增加中。1953年放映过九部，1954年十二部，1956年十九部，1957年达三十部之多，而1958年前十个月就放映了三十部。每部电影都竞相在恐怖方面超过前一部。资本主义制度的卫护者公然出来赞助鼓励这种片子。英国电影审查局秘书约翰·特里维林认为这种片子是“有益的”，他说：“有人对我说青年不自觉地用这种电影来考验勇气。由于没有经历过上次世界战争，他们不知道他们能否经受住下次战争。这在我看来将是他们可以把自己置身于恐怖中并发现他们如何反应的方法之一。”许多强盗片子的导演罗伯特·歇德马克在6月份“电影和电影摄制”杂志中说：“为什么我喜欢导演强盗片呢？这很容易回答。因为这些片子中包含着强烈的情感：爱情、憎恨、妒忌而且常常是蓄意谋杀。事实上，它们包含生活中的基本要素。”
    色情片也在向极端发展：大腿露胸片子已失去了吸引力，代之而起的是裸体电影。西伦敦同时放映着好几部裸体电影，影院门口贴满了巨幅的裸体女人照片。伦敦最繁华的牛津大街一个电影院的门口就有这样一个用彩色印着的裸体女人像的广告，下面印着这样几个字：
    “英国第一部裸体电影：
        裸体者的乐园
          激动人心的新明星”
    几个月来，“英国第一部”裸体电影的卖座率一直保持在最高水平。接着是第二部、第三部裸体电影也突击摄制出来了。第三部影片是在一个勋爵的“赞助”下被审查通过的。
    与此相对照的是，进步电影受到排挤、歧视和禁止。它们很少有和观众见面的机会。这首先是因为英国的电影业——从摄制、发行到放映——完全控制在几个垄断资本家的手中。这些垄断集团，又和美国资本有着非常密切的关系，它们成为“美国生活方式”最有力最强大的传播者。兰克公司是英国影片生产、发行、放映最大的一个垄断集团，甚至垄断了影片器材的生产，它目前在英国将近有四百所电影院，并同三个主要美国电影公司有密切关系；其次是联合英国影片公司（37％的股票为美国所掌握），它也将近有四百个电影院；另外一个英国狮子集团，主要从事于摄制和发行。这三个集团控制着英国的电影业，例如在放映方面，伦敦地区重要电影院的三分之二都为这三个集团所有。一些中小电影公司很难维持下去。一部电影在生产之前就须得到这些垄断集团的同意，假如这些集团认为这部电影片“没有娱乐价值”，那末这部片子等于判处了“死刑”，很难投入生产；即使勉强生产出来，也难于找到地方放映；即使找到放映的地方，也无法收回这部片子的生产费用。大垄断头子实际上决定什么应该演，什么又不应该演。资产阶级的所谓“自由”，实际上是垄断资本家的自由。
    除了这种限制之外，还有英国政府的电影审查制度的限制。
    说来也奇怪，英国的电影审查标准并没有明文规定，只是“根据每一个电影的优劣来决定”。这种优劣由谁来决定呢？由审查官。现在的主任审查官是前内务部副大臣赛德尼·哈里斯。揭露前法西斯头子、现任北大西洋集团中欧陆军总司令斯派特尔的影片“条顿人之剑”就遭到拒绝。但是如果这种片子被政府认为有宣传价值的话，就可以演。英国政治和经济计划报告书中说：“这种上演制度的独裁和国家的专制是否好，这就要看政治信仰了”。
    资产阶级电影的这种反人民性质，影片的粗制滥造，再加上电视的竞争，导致了英国电影的没落。“电影业的危机！”“兰克集团将要关闭更多的电影院！”“过去一年电影生产的下跌是电影史上最坏的一年！”这些常常都是在英国报纸上以大字标题刊登的新闻。从1954年到1957年的四年中，有三百四十多个电影院“关门大吉”，去年的年景更惨淡，电影院关闭了达二百五十个之多。这就是说，五年以来，英国关掉了它全部电影院的十分之一以上。观众上座率迅速下降，近两三年来下降的速度更为惊人。1958年看电影的人次仅为1948年的一半。影片的摄制也减少了，1958年生产了一百四十一部，今年只计划生产一百一十七部。人员大批地被裁减：兰克伦敦松树林摄影场在战后最繁荣时和一百一十二个电影明星订有摄制影片的合同，1957年减少到四十人，1958年又减少到二十五人。据演员公会说：“全国四分之一的演员没有工作做，原因是全国的许多电影拍制场和剧院都关门了”。
    不管资产阶级用什么办法，裸体影片也好，恐怖影片也好，都不能根本挽回电影业的没落，因为资本主义制度的树根已枯朽了，树叶哪里还能繁茂！
