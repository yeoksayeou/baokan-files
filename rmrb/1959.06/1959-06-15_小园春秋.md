    Small Garden Spring and Autumn
    Lu Nan
    The small vegetable garden in front of my house, a mere two square zhang in size, used to be a patch of weed-infested wasteland. Transforming it into a garden plot has been a project of the past year.
    Last spring, when cadres from our office were being sent to the countryside, I applied to the organization repeatedly, hoping to go to the villages and become a commune member myself, so I could thoroughly change my state of being "unskilled in physical labor and ignorant of the five grains." However, due to work needs, I was ultimately kept at the office. Although I cheerfully obeyed the leadership's decision, I always felt a sense of loss whenever I thought about missing a good opportunity for labor training.
    Perhaps to make up for this loss, I found a hoe around that time, turned over this piece of grassy land, and divided it into small plots according to my plan. Each ridge was strung with a line, striving for horizontal and vertical alignment, neatness, and beauty. I planted seasonal vegetables in each plot. Although the bok choy and radishes didn't sprout evenly due to improper planting, resembling a scabby head, the tomato seedlings did take root.
    Whenever I had time each day, I would watch over those few tomato plants, wishing I could give them a helping hand so they would flower and bear fruit immediately.
    Because I didn't know when to water them properly, and even less about how to fertilize them, the tomato plants grew slowly and were thin and yellow. Only then did I truly understand the meaning of the saying: Crops have feelings too, and if you don't take good care of them, they will show you their true colors. Now, I was indeed seeing their "colors."
    Having no other choice, I had to visit the old farmers in the nearby vegetable gardens. From them, I learned a little about vegetable cultivation. After a few applications of fertilizer and water, the tomato seedlings indeed turned from yellow to green, and in the summer, they finally bore abundant fruit. When I tasted the tomatoes I had grown myself, I was truly overjoyed, and even the sour taste of the tomatoes became sweet.
    Over the past year, I have tasted many fresh vegetables grown myself and learned the cultivation methods for common vegetables.
    Now, spring is in full swing in the small garden, and various vegetables are growing vigorously: red radishes are bursting through the soil, yam vines are climbing straight up along the bamboo frames, and tomatoes have already formed green fruits. Whenever I have time after work and meals, my two children and I come to the small garden to water it and weed it, feeling the endless joy of labor.
    I believe that after the flowering of spring, there will surely be the harvest of autumn; and I believe even more strongly that in future labor, I will surely gain more in thought.

    小园春秋
    鲁南
    我家门前那块两丈见方的小菜园，原是一块杂草丛生的空闲地，把它开辟成为园田，是最近一年以来的事情。
    去年春天，我们机关干部下放时，为了使自己能够彻底改变“四体不勤、五谷不分”的状况，我曾三番五次向组织提出申请，要求下乡当社员。但是由于工作需要，最后我还是被留在机关了。对于领导上这一决定，尽管自己是愉快地服从了，但是每当我想到失掉了一个劳动锻炼的好机会，心里总感到是一种损失。
    大约是为了弥补这一损失吧，就在那当儿，我找了把镢头，翻开了这块草地，按照自己的计划把它分成小畦，每条畦埂都挂过线，力求横竖成行，整齐美观。每块畦里都种上了适时的蔬菜。虽然小白菜和萝卜因种的不得法而出得不齐，像是癞痢头，但番茄秧毕竟栽活了。
    每天一有工夫，我就守着那几棵番茄，恨不能助它一臂之力，让它马上开花结果。
    由于不知道适时浇水，更不懂得怎样施肥，番茄秧不但长得缓慢，而且又瘦又黄。这时候我才真懂得了这句话的意思：庄稼也有感情，你要是不好好地伺候它，它是会给你颜色看的。如今，我果然看到它的“颜色”了。
    没法，我只得拜访附近菜园的老农。从那里我学得了一点蔬菜栽培常识。几次肥水一上，番茄秧果然由黄色变成了绿色，夏天，又终于结出了累累的果实。等到我吃到自己种植的番茄时，我真乐得了不得，就连番茄的酸味也变成甜的了。
    一年来，我尝到了许多自种的新鲜菜蔬，学会了常见蔬菜的栽培方法。
    如今，小园里春意正浓，各种菜蔬正在茁壮地生长：红萝卜胀裂了地皮，山药蔓正沿着竹架攀缘直上，番茄也已结了青果。每当工余饭后，我和我的两个孩子来到小园里，给它浇浇水，锄锄草，感觉到劳动的乐趣无穷。
    我相信，春华之后，必有秋实；而我加倍相信，在今后的劳动中，自己一定会在思想上得到更多的收获。
