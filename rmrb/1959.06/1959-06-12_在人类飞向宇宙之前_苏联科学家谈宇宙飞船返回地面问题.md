    "Before Humans Fly to Space"
    Soviet Scientists Discuss the Problem of Spaceships Returning to Earth
    Soviet scientist Professor Rozenblyum said that several complex technical problems concerning the safe return of spaceships to Earth are about to be successfully solved by Soviet scientists and technicians.
    Not long ago, the professor published an article in the "Medical Worker's Daily" entitled "Before Humans Fly to Space," in which he described in detail what technical difficulties related to human spaceflight science has solved and the solutions to them.
    Oxygen Supply Already Solved
    In order to fully guarantee the safety of people in spacecraft, a series of technical problems must be solved. First, it is necessary to protect people from the threat of oxygen deprivation. For this reason, it is necessary to maintain sufficient air pressure for normal breathing in the sealed cabin of the spacecraft, a method already used in modern stratospheric jets.
      Cabin Temperature Can Be Kept Normal
    Regarding the problem of maintaining the temperature inside the cabin during space flight, Rozenblyum said that this problem has actually been solved in the Soviet Union's third Earth satellite, where the temperature was maintained between 15 and 22 degrees Celsius throughout the entire working time of the instruments.
      Space Flight Not Afraid of Meteors
    The article then pointed out that the danger of meteor strikes during space flight should not cause fear. The fact that Soviet satellites have safely orbited the Earth for thousands of revolutions proves this point. At the same time, the scientist pointed out that in order to prevent sudden accidents in the cabin, there are also safety suits and spacesuits to prevent the impact of the cosmic medium.
      Humans Can Adapt to Weightlessness
    The experience gained from launching scientific exploration rockets and the second artificial satellite has proven that animals can withstand the effects of prolonged transverse acceleration. This experience has also proven that under weightless conditions, important processes such as breathing and blood circulation in animals do not undergo fundamental changes. As the body adapts to weightlessness, dizziness and other movement disorders will disappear.
      Cosmic Radiation Protection Available
    In addition, when discussing the issue of defending against the effects of cosmic rays, the article said that with the help of information on cosmic ray radiation obtained from Soviet satellites and space rockets, the problem of ensuring that space navigators are protected from its effects is about to be resolved.

    “在人类飞向宇宙之前”
    苏联科学家谈宇宙飞船返回地面问题
    苏联科学家罗泽恩勃柳姆教授说，关于宇宙飞船安全返回地面的若干复杂的技术问题，即将被苏联科学家和技术人员顺利解决了。
    不久前，这位教授在“医务工作者报”发表的一篇题为“在人类飞向宇宙之前”的文章中详细地讲述了目前科学已经解决了哪些有关人类在进行宇宙飞行时所将碰到的技术上的困难和解决它们的办法。
    供应氧气已有办法
    为了充分保证人在宇宙飞船中的安全，必须解决一系列的技术问题。首先要保证人免受氧气缺乏的威胁。为此，需要在宇宙飞船的密封舱中保持足供正常呼吸的气压，这种方法已经在现代同温层喷气式飞机中使用了。
      舱内温度能保正常
    关于在宇宙飞行时保持舱内温度的问题，罗泽恩勃柳姆说，这一问题实际上在苏联第三个地球卫星中已经解决，在那个卫星上仪器工作的全部时间内，温度都保持在摄氏十五至二十二度之间。
      宇宙飞行不怕流星
    文章接着指出，在宇宙飞行中流星撞击危险不会引起恐惧。苏联人造卫星已经安然地绕地球飞翔了几千转，这一事实就证明了这一点。同时，这位科学家又指出，为了预防舱房突然发生意外，还备有防止宇宙介质影响的安全服和宇宙服。
      人能适应失重情况
    发射科学考察火箭和第二个人造卫星时所取得的经验已经证明，动物是可以经受住长时间横向加速度的影响的。这一经验还证明，在失重条件下，动物的呼吸，血液循环等重要过程不会发生根本的变化，随着使身体适应于失重情况，头晕和其他一些活动失调的现象是会消失的。
      宇宙辐射防护有法
    此外，文章在谈到防御宇宙线影响的问题时说，借助于苏联卫星和宇宙火箭所获得的关于宇宙线辐射情况的情报，保证宇宙航行家免受它的影响的问题即将获得解决。
