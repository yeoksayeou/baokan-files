How Can Grassroots Party Organizations Play a Fortress Role?
The Party Branch of the Dongziyan Production Team in Chengguan Commune, Xinle County, Has Gained Good Experience

    (Our report) Xinle -- How can a production team's party branch improve its working methods, and how can it rely on party members and the masses to do its work well? The Dongziyan Production Team party branch of Chengguan People's Commune in Xinle County, Hebei Province, has provided good experience in this regard.
    
    Relying on Party Members to Do Good Work
    
    The Dongziyan Production Team party branch pays great attention to giving play to the fortress role of the party organization. They adhere to the principles of the Party in dealing with all issues, resolutely act in accordance with the Party's policies, report to the higher Party committee when something happens, and consult with the masses more often. They believe that how to ensure the implementation of the Party's policies and guidelines from an organizational perspective is an important issue. Therefore, they first carefully analyzed the reasons why the division of labor was often unclear in the past, with some work being handled by all branch committee members and some work being unattended to, and learned from it. After exploration, they finally found a way to organize and carry out all-round work. A clear division of labor was made from the branch committee members to the party members. Under the unified leadership of the branch committee, in addition to grasping the overall work, the secretary focused on political and ideological work. For work in all aspects, such as production, diversified operations, people's lives, and propaganda and education, the system of branch committee members being responsible for teams (each production team has a branch committee member concurrently serving as deputy political captain) and party members being responsible for groups (production teams) was implemented. At the same time, the branch also discussed and formulated five tasks with party members, including that each party member should "play a leading role in production, do a good job in propaganda and mobilization...", and stipulated that these five tasks should be used as the criteria for evaluating "five-good" party members and "five-good" cadres, with regular checks and evaluations. Through the "five-good" competition, the work enthusiasm and production initiative of party members and cadres have been greatly encouraged.
    
    In carrying out the "five-good" party member competition, they also frequently carried out criticism and self-criticism, and patiently helped party members correct their shortcomings. For example, in one evaluation, it was reported that branch committee member Liu Dashan was not active enough in participating in labor. In response to this issue, the branch committee asked, "Why are branch committee cadres falling behind the masses?" for discussion by the branch committee. Through discussion, everyone's ideological understanding was raised. Liu Dashan felt very ashamed, and he made a profound self-criticism at the party member meeting, expressing his determination to strive for first place. Since then, he has performed very well, so when the evaluation was carried out again, Liu Dashan was rated as a "five-good" party member. In the friendly mutual assistance competition of backward people actively catching up with advanced people, and advanced people striving to be more advanced, of the forty-three cadres at the team level and above in the entire production team, ten were rated as five-good, twenty-three as four-good, and ten as three-good.
    
    In order to give full play to the expertise and backbone role of each party member, the branch committee made appropriate adjustments to the work of the forty party members and thirty members of the Communist Youth League in the entire production team in a planned manner, and distributed them in various production teams, sideline businesses, cart teams, livestock sheds, canteens and other units, forming a network of work that ran vertically and horizontally. In this way, every new policy of the Party and every new task assigned by the branch committee can quickly meet with the party members and the masses. The Party's prestige among the masses has increased day by day, and the relationship between the Party and the masses has become closer. Many commune members have composed songs to praise the Party branch committee's leadership and the people's production enthusiasm is very high.
    
    Learn to Follow the Mass Line Well
    
    In all its work, the party branch of this team emphasizes following the mass line in everything. They say: "Cadres can only be the servants of the masses, not the 'officials' of the masses. Major issues must be discussed and agreed upon by everyone after mobilizing the masses before they can be handled." In order to truly practice democratic management and give full play to the wisdom of the masses to do a good job in production, the branch committee often pays attention to adopting the following methods.
    
    Visiting door to door. Whenever the branch committee wants to discuss more important issues, the branch committee members always solicit the opinions of the masses in advance. This year, the farming method for wheat was changed, and the team cadres had a lot of debate about whether to irrigate the wheat's returning green water early or late. How can this problem be solved correctly? The only way is to ask the masses for advice. After the branch committee members visited experienced old farmers door to door, they found the method of watering wheat: "First watering early, second watering late, third watering hurry up." Practice has proved that the experience of the masses is suitable for local conditions. Early first watering can increase ground temperature and promote early greening of wheat seedlings; watering late for the second watering can make the seedlings grow vigorously; the third watering should be followed closely to fully ensure the moisture needed by the wheat seedlings.
    
    Holding "Zhuge Liang Meetings". When the branch committee encounters some difficult problems to solve or major problems, it often holds "Zhuge Liang Meetings" - forums of old farmers or meetings of commune member representatives - to discuss them. During the spring plowing and sowing season, the commune party committee required the planting of White Horse Tooth corn with a row spacing of 1.8 feet and a plant spacing of 1.5 feet. The party branch handed this requirement over to the commune members for discussion; the commune members, based on the characteristics of the team's soil, which is mostly sandy and alkaline, and the planting experience over the years, believed that the row spacing could be 1.8 feet, but the plant spacing of 1.5 feet should be changed to three plants per 5 feet. The party branch reported this opinion to the commune party committee, and the commune party committee believed that the opinion of the masses reflected the spirit of adapting to local conditions, and the party branch should suggest that the production team follow the opinion of the masses. After doing so, the commune members were satisfied, and some people said: "Planting crops is decided by the farmers themselves, and the Party helps to find a way, and this year's bumper harvest will be even more promising."
    
    Big Ming, Big Fang, and Big Character Posters have become the main forms for the masses in this production team to offer opinions on their work. From the Spring Festival to the present, there have been more than 3,000 big character posters posted sporadically (not including the big character posters of mass mobilization in a work). The party branch insisted on improving the work while soliciting opinions and suggestions of the masses. Branch secretary Zhang Gunzi often said to the commune members: "One suggestion is equal to one pound of grain (meaning that improving the work based on the opinions of the masses can produce more grain), and thousands of suggestions will fill the granary." In early spring this year, some cadres' family members were not active in working, and the masses criticized them through big character posters. The branch committee immediately convened a forum for cadres' family members, and according to the opinions put forward by the masses, enlightened everyone to carry out criticism and self-criticism. Some people who were not active in working made self-criticisms on the spot and expressed their determination to resolutely correct themselves. Now these people have all achieved full attendance, and most of them have been rated as "seven-good" commune members.
    
    This party branch pays attention to taking the initiative in all its work. For this year's summer harvest and summer planting, they made proper arrangements through mass Big Ming, Big Fang, and Big Character Poster debates. The masses posted a total of more than 2,200 big character posters. The party branch summarized the opinions of the masses and helped the production team adjust the labor force and divide it into two battle lines: summer harvest and summer planting, and management of autumn crops. The wheat was contracted to production teams and households in advance, and a method of harvesting and threshing on the spot was also established to ensure harvesting and threshing with no delays, and to reduce transportation labor and time. The big character poster has become a tool for the party branch to extensively promote democracy and constantly improve its work. When some commune members praised the role of the big character poster, they said: "The big character poster is a magic weapon, and it is good wherever it is used."
    
    Improve the Quality of Meetings
    
    Mass meetings and cadre meetings must be held, but the key is how to hold fewer meetings and how to hold meetings well. In the past, one was that there were too many meetings that could be held or not held, and the masses were not satisfied, and it took a long time to gather; second, too many people spoke, and the masses were bored of listening, and the masses did not get enough rest, and they had no energy to work the next day. After repeated consultations with the masses, combined with past experiences, the branch committee decided that meetings that could be held or not held should be resolutely not held. For some meetings that had to be held, full preparations should be made in advance, and the tasks to be assigned to the lower levels by various departments should be summarized by the branch and assigned to one person to speak, with a maximum of no more than two people; mass meetings should be held less frequently, once a month (this meeting is mainly to summarize and deploy production work, evaluate and issue awards, and commend model commune members). General work is assigned to the team by the production team cadres, or communicated by Party and CYL members door to door according to the contracting arrangements. After doing so, the masses were very satisfied. Now this production team can gather in more than ten minutes to hold a mass meeting, and the meeting will be dismissed in no more than one and a half hours. This approach has been welcomed by the commune members.
    
    Grasp the Advanced and Also Grasp the Backward
    
    In addition to adopting the method of branch committees being responsible for teams and Party and CYL members being responsible for households, the party branch of this production team also adopted the method of grasping key points to lead the general in terms of political and ideological leadership of various tasks in the entire team. One is to grasp the advanced and lead the backward. The Second Production Team is doing a good job in various tasks. The branch committee sent two members to regularly assist the team cadres in planning their work, creating and summarizing various advanced experiences, and convening on-site meetings in a timely manner to promote them to the entire production team. From the Spring Festival to the present, they have held a total of seven on-site meetings in the Second Production Team on production, life, team operation and management, and livestock breeding. Each time after the on-site meeting, advanced experiences have quickly taken root and blossomed in the entire production team, which has played a great role in promoting the work. The other is to grasp the backward and catch up with the advanced, which is also very effective. The First Production Team was relatively backward in its work in the past. The branch committee sent deputy branch secretary Wang Jiubao and branch committee member Wang Jinger to provide specific assistance. In addition to helping the production team cadres find the reasons for the backwardness and think of measures to solve the problems, they also highlighted a backward link in the work and convened on-site meetings to educate the backward, educate everyone, and promote the overall situation. During the spring sowing this year, the land in the First Team was not leveled well, so an on-site meeting was held there for the heads of production teams to participate in. This meeting was very educational for all the people who attended the meeting. After the meeting, the work of the First Team also quickly caught up.

    基层党组织怎样发挥堡垒作用
    新乐县城关公社东紫烟生产队党支部取得好经验
    本报讯　生产队的党支部怎样改进工作方法，怎样依靠党员和群众做好工作？河北省新乐县城关人民公社东紫烟生产队党支部，在这方面提供了良好的经验。
    依靠党员作好工作
    东紫烟生产队党支部，很注意发挥党组织的堡垒作用。他们对一切问题的处理，都认真坚持了党的原则，坚决按照党的政策办事，有事请示上级党委，多同群众商量。他们认为，怎样从组织上来保证党的方针政策的贯彻，是一个重要问题。因此，他们首先认真分析了过去常常因为分工不清，有的工作支委们都抓，有的工作没人管的原因，从中吸取了教训。经过摸索，终于找到了组织好全面进行工作的办法。从支委到党员都作了明确的分工。在支委会的统一领导下，支书除了掌握全面工作以外，着重抓政治思想工作。对生产、多种经营、群众生活、宣传教育等各个方面的工作，实行了支委包队（生产小队各有一名支部委员兼任政治副队长），党员包组（生产小组）的办法。同时，支部还同党员共同讨论制定了每个党员都要在“生产中起带头作用，做好宣传鼓动工作，……”等五项任务，规定这五项任务作为“五好”党员和“五好”干部的评比条件，定期检查评比。通过“五好”竞赛，大大鼓舞了党员和干部的工作热情和生产积极性。
    他们在开展“五好”党员竞赛中，还经常开展批评与自我批评，对党员的缺点，认真耐心地帮助他们改正。如在一次评比中，有人反映支部委员刘大山参加劳动不够积极，支委会针对这个问题，提出
  “支委干部为什么落在群众后边？”让支委会讨论，经过讨论，提高了大家的思想认识。刘大山感到很惭愧，他在党员大会上作了深刻检讨，表示了他要力争第一的决心。自此以后，他表现很好，因此当再次评比的时候，刘大山被评为“五好”党员了。在落后的积极赶先进，先进的力争更先进的友好互助竞赛中，全生产队小队以上的干部四十三人，被评为五好的十人，四好的二十三人，三好的十人。
    为了充分发挥每个党员的专长和骨干作用，支委会有计划地把全生产队四十个党员和三十个团员的工作作了适当的调整，把他们分布在各生产小组、副业摊子、大车队、牲畜棚、食堂等单位，形成了一个纵横贯通的工作网。这样，党的每项新的政策，支委会布置的每一项新的工作，很快就可以通过党员和群众见面。党在群众中的威信日益提高，党和群众关系更密切了，不少社员编了歌谣来歌颂党支委会领导有方，群众的生产热情非常高涨。
    学会走好群众路线
    这个队的党支部在各项工作中，强调事事走好群众路线。他们说：“干部只能做群众的勤务员，不能当群众的‘官’，重大问题一定要经过发动群众，大家讨论同意，才能去办。”队里为了真正作到民主办社，充分发挥群众智慧，搞好生产，支委会经常注意采用以下几种办法。
    登门拜访。支委会凡是要讨论比较重要的问题时，支部委员们总要事先分头征求群众的意见。今年小麦改变了耕作方法，队干部对浇小麦返青水早浇还是晚浇，争论很大。怎样才能正确地解决这个问题呢？唯一的办法是找群众去请教。经过支部委员们登门拜访有经验的老农，找到了“头水早，二水晚，三水赶”的浇麦方法。实践证明，群众的经验是适合当地情况的。头水早可以增加地温，促使麦苗早日返青；二水晚些浇，可以使苗长得茁壮；三水以后应该紧接着浇，以便充分保证麦苗需要的水分。
    开“诸葛亮会”。支委会在遇到一些比较难解决的问题或重大问题时，也常常召开“诸葛亮会”——老农座谈会或社员代表会来商量。春耕播种期间，公社党委对白马牙玉米播种要求行距尺八，株距尺五。党支部把这个要求交给社员群众去讨论；社员们根据本队土质多沙碱的特点和历年来的种植经验，认为行距按尺八可以，株距尺五应改为五尺三棵。党支部把这个意见呈报给公社党委，公社党委认为群众的意见体现了因地制宜的精神，党支部应当建议生产队按照群众的意见去办。这样做了以后，社员们感到满意，有的人说：“种庄稼由庄稼人自己拿主意，党再帮着出个道道，今年的大丰收就更有指望了。”
    大鸣大放大字报，已经成为这个生产队的群众对工作提意见的主要形式。自春节到现在，光零星贴出的大字报就有三千多张（在一项工作中集中发动群众大鸣大放的大字报没算在内）。党支部对群众的每一条意见，都坚持了边鸣放边改进的作法。支部书记张滚子经常对社员们说：“一条意见一斤粮（意思是群众提意见改进工作可以多打粮食），千条意见谷满仓。”今年初春，有的干部家属出工不积极，群众通过大字报提出了批评。支委会立即召开了干部家属座谈会，按照群众提出的意见，启发大家开展了批评和自我批评。一些出工不积极的人，当场作了检讨，纷纷表示要坚决改正。现在这些人都达到了满勤，多数被评为“七好”社员。
    这个党支部在各项工作中都注意争取主动。对今年的夏收夏种，他们通过群众大鸣大放大字报大辩论，作到了妥善安排。群众共贴出大字报二千二百多张，党支部归纳了群众的意见，帮助生产队调整了劳力，划分为夏收夏种和大秋作物管理两条战线。事前就把麦子包到生产小组和户，还订出了就地收割就地打场的办法，保证随割随打，减少运输劳力和时间。大字报在这里已经成为党支部广泛发扬民主、不断改进工作的一种工具。有的社员歌颂大字报的作用时说：“大字报，是法宝，那里用它那里好。”
      提高开会质量
    群众会、干部会不开不行，关键问题是怎样作到少开会和把会开好。过去，一是可开可不开的会太多，群众不满意，集合起来慢慢腾腾；二是讲话的人太多，群众听起来很厌烦，群众休息不好，第二天干活没精神。经过反复和群众商量，结合以往情况，支委会确定：可开可不开的会坚决不开，对一些非开不可的会，要事先作好充分准备，按照党的中心工作把各部门要向下布置的任务，由支部汇总起来指定一个人去讲，最多不超过两个人；群众大会要少开，规定一月一次（这个会主要是总结、部署生产工作，评比发奖，表扬模范社员）。一般的工作由生产队的干部到小队去布置，或由党、团员按包户的规定串门去传达。这样作以后，群众很满意。现在这个生产队开群众大会，有十几分钟就能集合起来，最多不超过一个半小时就散会。这种作法受到了社员的欢迎。
    抓先进也抓落后
  这个生产队的党支部，对全队各项工作的政治思想领导，除了采用支委包小队，党、团员包户的办法以外，还采用了抓重点带一般的方法。一是抓先进带落后。第二生产小队各种工作搞的好，支委会派了两个委员经常在那里帮助小队干部计划工作，创造和总结各种先进经验，及时召开现场会议向全生产队推广。从春节到现在，他们在第二小队召开的生产、生活、小队经营管理、牲口饲养等现场会议共七次，每一次现场会议结束后，先进经验就在全生产队迅速开花结果，对推动工作起了很大作用。再就是抓落后赶先进，这个办法也很有效。第一生产小队过去工作比较落后，支委会派了支部副书记王九保和支委王经儿去进行具体帮助，除了帮助生产小队的干部找落后原因，想措施解决问题外，还突出地抓工作中的一个落后环节召开现场会议，教育落后，教育大家，推动全局。今年春播时，第一小队的土地平整得不好，就在那里召开了生产小组长参加的现场会议。这个会对所有到会人员的教育意义都很大。会后第一小队的工作也很快赶上来了。
