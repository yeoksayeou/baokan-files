Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, June 21st. Over the past four years, Nanjing College of Traditional Chinese Medicine has researched and organized the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine, compiling 96 different types of TCM books.

In the past, traditional medical teaching methods in our country were passed down through families or from master to apprentice, lacking a comprehensive and systematic set of TCM textbooks. Furthermore, there are numerous TCM books, each written at different times, in different regions, and for different audiences, resulting in diverse and sometimes contradictory schools of thought, each with its own characteristics and limitations. No one had ever comprehensively and systematically organized the various schools of thought in TCM. Since liberation, under the leadership of the Party, TCM has developed rapidly, with the establishment of many high- and intermediate-level TCM colleges. Many Western medicine practitioners are also eager to learn TCM, all of whom require relatively complete and systematic TCM textbooks and reference books suitable for general reading comprehension. Given the existing state of TCM books, no single book could be used as a textbook, and the archaic and difficult language of the original texts poses certain difficulties for beginners. The Party Committee of Nanjing College of Traditional Chinese Medicine thus led teachers and advanced students (TCM practitioners with a certain theoretical foundation and clinical experience) to begin compiling textbooks.

Over the past four years, this college has compiled 25 different major textbooks, many of which have been adopted by other medical colleges across the country. The "Introduction to Traditional Chinese Medicine" and "Introduction to Chinese Materia Medica," commissioned by the Ministry of Health, have been designated as TCM textbooks for senior medical colleges.

The college has also compiled 69 reference books related to TCM clinical practice, teaching, and research. The published "Acupuncture and Moxibustion" and "Essentials of the Inner Canon" have been highly regarded by the domestic medical community. Another example is "Chinese Materia Medica," a monumental work of over 700,000 characters, including 459 kinds of Chinese medicines and 651 illustrations, providing rich material for the study of Chinese materia medica.

This newspaper reports that Li Shizhen's "Compendium of Materia Medica," compiled during the Ming Dynasty, included 1,892 kinds of Chinese medicinal substances. Now, the "Grand Dictionary of Chinese Materia Medica" being compiled by Nanjing College of Traditional Chinese Medicine will include nearly twice as many medicinal varieties, with an estimated 5,000 kinds of Chinese medicines in the entire book, totaling approximately six million characters. At the same time, the college is also compiling a "Grand Dictionary of TCM Formulas," collecting more than 115,000 ancient and modern formulas, estimated to be over 20 million characters.

In order to compile the "Grand Dictionary of Chinese Materia Medica," the college organized seven interview teams who traveled over mountains and rivers to more than 20 provinces and cities, collecting 4,383 specimens of pressed leaves and 1,098 kinds of medicinal material specimens. They also collected many rare literature editions and copied many materials about the efficacy of new varieties of Chinese medicine. During the compilation of the "Grand Dictionary of TCM Formulas," they consulted more than 600 books related to TCM formulas. Each formula included in the dictionary underwent sixteen meticulous procedures such as review, modification, annotation, transcription, and arrangement, and detailed information was provided on the origin, usage, and other aspects of hundreds of formulas.

Currently, the first drafts of the two grand dictionaries, totaling 27 million characters, have been completed. The compilers of these two grand dictionaries are now carefully reviewing the manuscripts, and it is expected that the compilation and organization work will be basically completed before National Day.

    研究整理祖国医学遗产
    南京中医学院编写中医教材
    两部中医中药大辞典初稿完成
    新华社南京21日电　南京中医学院四年来研究整理祖国医药遗产，已编写出各种中医书籍九十六种。
    我国过去医学的传统教学方式都是祖传或师传，没有一套全面的系统的中医教材，而中医书籍又很多，由于这些书编写的时间、地区和对象不同，各家学说纷纭，各有特点，也各有其局限性。过去从来没有人将中医的各家学说进行全面的系统的整理。解放后，中医事业在党的领导下有了迅速的发展，创办了许多高、中级的中医学院校，很多西医也迫切的要求学习中医，都要求有比较完整的系统的中医教材和适合一般阅读能力的参考用书，根据现有的中医书籍的情况，就不能用某一种作为课本，同时原书语言深奥难懂，使初学者发生一定的困难。南京中医学院党委便领导教师和进修学员（有一定理论基础、临床经验的中医）着手编写教材。
    四年来，这个学院共编写了各种主要教材二十五种，其中有多种教材已被全国其他医药院校采用。卫生部所委托他们编写的“中医学概论”、“中药学概论”等书已被指定为高级医药院校的中医课本。
    这个学院还编写出六十九部有关中医临床、教学、研究用的参考书。已经出版的“针灸学”、“内经辑要”，都受到国内医学界的重视。其他如“中药学”是一部有七十多万字，包括四百五十九种中药、插图六百五十一幅的巨著，它对研究中药学提供了丰富的材料。
    本报讯　明代李时珍编写的“本草纲目”收载了一千八百九十二种中药药物，现在，南京中医学院正在编写的“中药学大辞典”比它所收载的药物品种增加将近二倍，全书估计收录五千多种中药，约六百万字左右。同时该院还编写一部“中医方剂大辞典”，搜集了古今成方十一万五千多张，估计约二千多万字。
    为了编写“中药学大辞典”，该院组织了七个采访小组，翻山越岭，涉水渡河，到二十多个省、市收集了腊叶标本四千三百八十三份，药材标本一千零九十八种，还搜集了不少文献珍本，和抄到许多有关中药新品种功用的资料。在编写“中医方剂大辞典”的时候，他们参阅有关记载中医方剂的书籍六百多部，编入辞典的每一张成方都经过审核、修改、注解、抄录、编排等十六道细致的手续，并且对几百张成方的出处、用法等作出了详细的资料介绍。
    现在，共计达二千七百万字的两部大辞典的初稿已经完成。目前这两部大辞典的编写人员正在审慎地进行审稿，预计国庆节前可基本完成编纂整理工作。
