    Neither Small Nor Simple
    Kong Sang
    Small native products are scattered and appear to be small things and small matters, but in reality, they are not small at all.
    In terms of variety, there are more than two or three thousand major ones. In terms of distribution, from the coast to Xinjiang, from Heilongjiang to Hainan Island, every province, autonomous region, and county has them. In terms of function, some are raw materials for forest chemical industry, some are wild plant oil materials, some are wild plant starch materials, some are raw materials for daily sundry goods; some can be eaten, some can be used, some can be worn, some can cure diseases, and some are important export materials. They are truly indispensable for socialist construction and people's lives. In terms of its proportion in rural income, some can supplement daily expenses, and some are simply crucial. For example, the Weihe Town People's Commune in Shangzhi County, Heilongjiang Province, had a total income of 2.03 million yuan from local and sideline products last year. In addition to using this money to pay wages to commune members, the commune also purchased a considerable amount of agricultural machinery and chemical fertilizers, which strongly supported agricultural production. Another example is the Liangjiatai Shangyou People's Commune in Qinglong County, Hebei Province, which had an income of more than 280,000 yuan from local specialties from December last year to January this year, which can pay six months' wages to commune members. It can be seen that small native products cannot be underestimated.
    Some people say: "The problem of small native products can be solved as long as the Party committee pays attention to it." This statement has some truth. As the saying goes, "Of all things, the Party's leadership is the most important." In our country, what can be done without the Party's leadership? Especially small native products, which are scattered and small compared to grain and cotton, are often easily overlooked. If the Party committee does not give appropriate consideration when arranging rural labor, the collection and production of small native products will indeed be not guaranteed.
    However, is it that all problems will be solved as long as the Party committee pays attention to it? I am afraid it is not that simple. In addition to the Party committee's unified arrangement of labor and mobilization of the masses to collect and produce, there is still much to be done in how the commercial departments can do a good job in specific tasks such as purchasing, organizing collection, and promoting production. Taking purchasing as an example, if you sit in the city and wait for farmers to bring them to your door, you will collect less; if you are not afraid of high mountains and long roads and go to the countryside to collect, you will collect more; if you only collect large quantities and not small quantities, you will collect less; if you collect both small and large quantities, you will collect more. Here, the subjective initiative of commercial staff plays a great decisive role.
    In order to promote the production and collection of small native products, and in order to purchase more small native products to support national construction and production, commercial staff must not think that the purchase of small native products is very simple. They must carry forward the spirit of hard struggle of not being afraid of trouble and not being afraid of climbing mountains and wading through rivers, and creatively carry out their work.

    既不小，也不简单
    孔桑
    小土产品零星分散，看来好像是一些小东西、小事情，其实井不小。
    论品种，主要的也有二、三千种以上。论分布，从海滨到新疆，从黑龙江到海南岛，无论那一个省、自治区、县都有。论作用，有的是林产化工原料，有的是野生植物油料，有的是野生植物淀粉原料，有的是日用杂品原料；有的可以吃，有的可以用，有的可以穿，有的可以治病，有的还是出口的重要物资，真是社会主义建设和人民生活所不能缺少的。论它在农村收入中的比重，少的可以帮补日常零用，多的简直可以举足轻重，如黑龙江省尚志县苇河镇人民公社，去年土副产品收入共二百零三万元，公社除了拿这笔钱给社员发工资外，还购买了相当数量的农业机械和化学肥料，有力地支援了农业生产。又如河北青龙县亮甲台上游人民公社，从去年12月到今年1月，土特产收入达二十八万多元，可给社员发六个月的工资。可见小土产是轻视不得的。
    有人说：“小土产问题嘛，只要党委重视就解决了。”这句话有一定的道理。所谓“千条万条，党的领导是第一条”，在我们的国家里，有哪一样事能够离开党的领导？特别是小土产，零星分散，比起粮食、棉花来，真是小得很，往往比较容易被忽视。要是党委在安排农村劳动力的时候，不给以适当照顾，小土产的采集和生产确实是没有保障的。
    然而，是不是党委一重视，一切问题就解决了呢？恐怕没有这样简单。党委除了统一安排劳动力和发动群众采集和生产以外，商业部门如何做好收购、组织采集和促进生产等具体工作，还大有文章可做。拿收购来讲，你坐在城市里等农民送上门来，就收得少；不怕山高路远，跑到农村里去收，就收得多些；你只收大批的不收零星的，就收得少，零的整的都收，就收得多些。在这里，商业工作人员的主观能动性有很大的决定作用。
    为了促进小土产品的生产和采集，为了收购更多的小土产品支援国家建设和生产，商业工作人员绝不能把小土产品的收购看得很简单，一定要发扬不怕麻烦、不怕爬山涉水的艰苦奋斗精神，创造性地开展自己的工作。
