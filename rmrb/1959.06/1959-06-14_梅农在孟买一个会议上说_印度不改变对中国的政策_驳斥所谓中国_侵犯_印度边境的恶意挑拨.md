Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, June 13th: According to Indian press sources: Indian Defense Minister Krishna Menon said at a meeting in Bombay on June 12th that India's policy toward People's China has basically not changed. He said that India basically still adheres to its past friendly relations with China and supports the restoration of the People's Republic of China's seat in the United Nations.

Speaking on the relations between India and China regarding the Tibetan issue, he said that India indeed does not like the trend of certain things happening in Tibet. But China has also repeatedly expressed its views. This is inevitable between two independent countries.

Menon refuted on the spot the malicious provocations of the so-called Chinese "invasion of the Indian border," saying, "I currently do not know of any such thing."

When talking about border incidents between India and Pakistan, Menon said, "The India-Pakistan border is very long, so it is difficult to investigate every border violation." He also said that if that country "attacks India, the entire people will unite like one person to repel the invaders."

    梅农在孟买一个会议上说
    印度不改变对中国的政策
    驳斥所谓中国“侵犯”印度边境的恶意挑拨
    新华社新德里13日电　据印度新闻处消息：印度国防部长克里希纳·梅农6月12日在孟买的一个会议上说，印度对人民中国的政策基本上没有改变。他说，印度基本上仍然坚持它过去对中国的友好关系，并支持恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的席位。
    他在就西藏事件谈到印度和中国的关系时说，的确，印度并不喜欢在西藏所发生的某些事情的趋向。但是中国也多次地表示了它的看法。这是两个独立的国家之间所不可避免的事情。
    梅农当场驳斥了所谓中国“侵犯了印度边境”的恶意挑拨，他说，“目前我还不知道有任何这样的事情。”
    梅农在谈到印度和巴基斯坦边境事件的时候说，“印巴交界线很长，所以很难来调查每一侵犯边境的事件。”他又说，如果有那个国家“攻击印度的话，全体人民将团结起来像一个人一样，来反击侵略者。”
