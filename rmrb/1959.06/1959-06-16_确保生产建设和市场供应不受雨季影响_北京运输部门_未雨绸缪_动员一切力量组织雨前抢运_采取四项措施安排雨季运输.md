To ensure that production and construction and market supply are not affected by the rainy season, the Beijing transportation department "prepare in advance," mobilizing all forces to organize pre-rain rush transport and adopt four measures to arrange rainy season transportation.

(From Our Newspaper) As the rainy season in North China approaches, relevant transportation departments in Beijing are taking measures to ensure that transportation tasks are not affected during the rainy season.
According to weather forecasts, Beijing will experience significant rainfall in July and August this year. The rainfall during these two months will account for 70% of the total annual rainfall. Based on past practices, during the rainy season, less is transported on rainy days, followed by concentrated efforts after the rain, often leading to the wastage of materials and even delays in production. This year, with a planned increase in freight volume of 65% compared to last year, the contradiction between large transport volume and small transport capacity will become more acute during the rainy season. To address this issue, relevant transportation departments in Beijing have summarized past experiences and lessons from rainy season transportation and decided to mobilize all transportation forces to organize a transportation campaign in June before the arrival of the rainy season, rushing to transport seven million tons of urgently needed materials for production and construction, as well as daily necessities. Since late May, transportation command centers in all seventeen districts of the city have held meetings with cargo owners to understand the source of goods and dispatched cadres to understand the condition of transportation tools and roads. The transportation command centers in each district have prioritized the transportation of materials based on the urgency of needs, striving to transport and store more goods before the rainy season. The materials to be rushed before the rainy season include: 1. A large amount of urgently needed materials for which roads are in poor condition and difficult to pass during rainy days, such as ore, refractory materials, and coke. 2. Goods that are susceptible to moisture but are needed in large quantities for production or daily life, such as grain, cotton, cement, and daily necessities. 3. Goods that are susceptible to water damage, such as vitex and small kiln coal. Recently, various transportation stations have been working intensely to rush transport these materials. On many highways leading to the suburbs, one can often see truck trains with trailers, fully loaded with dolomite, cement, daily necessities, and other materials, roaring past.
The Beijing transportation department is actively carrying out four prevention measures: road protection, cargo protection, personnel protection, and vehicle protection, so that during the rainy season, there will be no stops in transportation, loading, or unloading. The Beijing Transportation Company has conducted a comprehensive inspection of roads in the suburbs and on-site, finding that seventy-four roads are muddy and difficult to travel after rain, affecting driving safety, and need to be repaired. These days, they are consulting with material departments and consigning units to try to repair these roads once before the rainy season to ensure normal transportation during the rainy season. In terms of cargo protection, the transportation department has done a good job in organizing the source of goods suitable for rainy season transportation, planning to complete most of the winter coal transportation tasks during the rainy season. At the same time, it is also actively assisting material departments to add simple rain sheds and do a good job in preventing rain damage to goods. In terms of personnel protection, it is planned to equip stevedores and site workers with rain gear and set up simple tents as resting places. Especially important is vehicle protection. These days, all vehicle yards are mobilizing the masses to conduct a comprehensive inspection and maintenance of all vehicles. And formulate measures that must be guaranteed before driving out in the rainy season is that the lighting equipment and braking performance are good, should slow down and honk the horn when encountering heavy storms, and strictly prohibit gliding and overtaking and other measures to ensure safe driving in the rainy season.

    确保生产建设和市场供应不受雨季影响
    北京运输部门“未雨绸缪”
    动员一切力量组织雨前抢运  采取四项措施安排雨季运输
    本报讯　华北地区的雨季即将到来，北京有关运输部门正在采取措施，以保证在雨季运输任务不受影响。
    据气象台预报，今年7、8月间，北京将有较大的雨量。这两个月的降雨量将占全年降雨量的70％。根据往年惯例，在雨季时期内，都是雨天运得少，雨后搞突击，常常容易糟蹋物资，甚至耽误生产。今年，在计划货运量比去年增加65％的情况下，一到雨季，运量大、运力小的矛盾，将会更加尖锐。为了解决这个问题，北京有关运输部门总结了以往雨季运输的经验教训，决定动员一切运输力量，抢在雨季到来以前，在6月份组织一次运输战役，抢运生产建设上所急需的物资和日用百货等七百万吨。5月下旬以来，全市十七个区的运输指挥部都分别召开货主会议，摸清货源，并派出干部了解运输工具和道路情况。各区运输指挥部根据物资需用情况的轻重缓急，分别进行物资运输排队，争取在雨季前多运储一些货物。在雨季前抢运的物资包括：1、道路很坏、雨天很难通车而又迫切需要的大量物资，如矿石、耐火材料、焦炭等。2、怕潮的货物，而生产或生活中又大量需要的，如粮食、棉花、水泥、日用百货等。3、怕水冲的货物，如荆条、小窑煤等。最近，各个运输站都在紧张地抢运这些物资，人们在通往郊区的许多条公路上，经常能看到挂着拖车的汽车列车，满载着白云石、水泥、日用百货等物资，轰隆隆地驶过去。
    北京市的运输部门正在积极地进行路防、货防、人防、车防等四防工作，以便雨季期间做到不停车、不停装、不停卸。北京市运输公司已经对郊区和现场的道路进行了全面检查，发现有七十四条道路雨后泥泞难行，影响行车安全，需要整修。这几天，他们正和物资部门、托运单位共同协商，争取在雨季前对这些道路整修一次，保证雨季正常运输。在货防工作方面，运输部门已经做好适合雨季运输的货源组织工作，计划在雨季期间完成大部分的冬煤运输任务。同时，还积极协助物资部门增添简易雨棚，做好货物的防雨工作。在人防方面，计划给装卸工人、现场员配备雨具，设置简易帐篷，作为休息的场所。特别重要的是车防工作。这几天，各个车场都在发动群众对所有车辆进行一次全面的检查和维修。并且制定出雨季出车前必须保证灯光设备、刹车性能良好，遇大风暴雨应减速、鸣笛，严格禁止滑行和超车等措施，来确保雨季安全行驶。
