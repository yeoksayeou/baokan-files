Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, June 23rd: The working people of Poland are greeting the 15th anniversary of the founding of Poland on July 22nd with new production achievements.

The frequent reports of victory from production fronts across the country have filled Poland with a joyous atmosphere. On June 15th, thirteen coal mines across the country completed their production tasks for the first half of the year ahead of schedule, exceeding the plan by 86,000 tons of coal in the first two weeks of June alone. On June 16th, workers in forty textile factories in the city and province of Łódź announced that they had overproduced products worth a total of 60 million zlotys.

In addition, workers in various regions have put forward new guarantees to greet the holiday. Workers at the Nowotko Textile Factory are determined to overproduce 15,000 kilograms of high-quality yarn in June, worth 800,000 zlotys. Workers at the Luxembourg Factory in Łódź guarantee to increase production by 56,000 kilograms of yarn in the third quarter of this year. Workers at the Łódź Artificial Fiber Factory have accepted a large number of production tasks. By improving the production process and making better use of raw materials, they will increase the production of approximately 80,000 kilograms of artificial fiber in the third quarter of this year, worth 2.1 million zlotys. The Warski Shipyard in Szczecin decided to deliver two ships ahead of schedule this year, which were originally planned to be built next year.

In order to make transportation more convenient, the people of the capital, Warsaw, will build about fifteen kilometers of new streets, reconstruct and repair five kilometers of old streets, and build about seven kilometers of tram lines before National Day. A double-hole bridge with a length of 400 meters will be built over the Vistula River, and a 70-meter-long bridge and three tunnels with a total length of 100 meters will be built on the Praga Port Canal. To make Warsaw more beautiful, the people of the capital are vigorously building new street parks and small flower gardens, and the total area of the new gardens will be about five times larger than the area of the previous gardens.

Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, June 23rd: In the first five months of this year, Romania's heavy industry sector overfulfilled the production plan by 3.5%, the light industry sector by 2.2%, and the food industry sector by 5.7%. One of the important reasons for these achievements is that Romanian workers have launched a socialist labor competition movement to complete and overfulfill the 1959 industrial production plan since the beginning of this year. In order to greet the 15th anniversary of Romania's liberation (August 23rd) with greater production achievements, they are now pushing the competition movement to a new climax.

Romanian metallurgical workers have already overproduced more than 50,000 tons of steel, more than 16,000 tons of pig iron, and more than 26,000 tons of steel products in the first five months of this year. In order to offer gifts to the festival, they have raised the production increase targets. For example, the coking workers of the Hunedoara Metallurgical United Factory, the largest iron and steel industrial enterprise in the country, decided to produce 50,000 tons more coke than the original annual production plan, and the steel rolling workers decided to produce 1,000 tons more steel. Workers at the Reșița United Factory plan to produce 2,800 tons more pig iron and continue to reduce the cost per ton of steel.

Thirty metallurgical and machine-building enterprises in the Stalin region recently held a joint production conference and decided to further carry out the socialist labor competition movement under the slogan of "highest labor productivity, lowest cost, best product quality." The Ernst Thälmann Tractor Factory in this region is preparing to save 3 million lei and produce 35 more engines before the festival. The factory's youth production team also initiated a proposal that youth production teams across the country strive to become advanced labor collectives, and many factories' youth production teams have responded to this call.

The chemical industry sector is taking practical actions to accelerate the construction of many new chemical factories and workshops to greet the festival. Oil drilling workers drilled 20,000 meters more than planned in the first five months of this year, and they are now working at a faster drilling speed. Oil refining workers have also formulated new plans to greet the festival, and workers at the No. 1 Refinery in Ploiești have decided to save 1,200 tons more oil than originally planned.

The light and food industries have also decided to increase equipment utilization, reduce production costs, and supply residents with more textiles and food.

    决心创造新的成绩迎接国庆十五周年
    波兰和罗马尼亚人民提出增产保证
    新华社华沙23日电　波兰各地劳动人民正以新的生产成就迎接7月22日——波兰建国十五周年。
    从各地生产战线上频频传来的捷报使波兰全国充满了喜气洋洋的气氛。6月15日，全国有十三个煤矿提前完成了今年前半年的生产任务，仅在6月份的头两个星期内就超计划生产了八万六千吨煤。16日，罗兹市和罗兹省的四十个纺织工厂的工人宣布，他们已经超额生产了总值六千万兹罗提的产品。
    此外，各地职工还为迎接节日提出了新的保证。诺沃特科纺织厂的工人决心要在6月份超计划生产一万五千公斤高级纱，总值达八十万兹罗提。罗兹的卢森堡工厂职工保证要在今年第三季度增产五万六千公斤纱。罗兹人造纤维工厂的职工接受了大批的生产任务。由于改进了生产过程和更好地利用原材料，他们在今年第三季度将增产约八万公斤人造纤维，总值达二百一十万兹罗提。什切青的瓦尔斯基造船厂决定今年提前把两艘轮船交付使用，而这两艘船按原来计划是要在明年建成的。
    首都华沙人民为了使交通更加便利，在国庆节前要建成约十五公里长的新街道，改建和修筑五公里长的旧街道，约七公里长的电车线。在维斯杜拉河上将建成一座长达四百公尺的双孔桥，在布拉格港运河上将建成一座七十公尺长的桥和总长为一百公尺的三个隧道。为了使华沙更加美丽，首都人民正在大力兴建新的街心公园和小花圃，新建花园的总面积要比以前的花园的面积约大五倍。
    新华社布加勒斯特23日电　在今年头五个月中，罗马尼亚重工业部门超额3.5％、轻工业部门超额2.2％、食品工业部门超额5.7％完成了生产计划，取得这些成绩的重要原因之一是由于罗马尼亚的工人们从今年年初起就掀起了争取完成和超额完成1959年工业生产计划的社会主义劳动竞赛运动。为了以更大的生产成就迎接罗马尼亚解放十五周年（8月23日），他们现在正把竞赛运动推向一个新的高潮。
    罗马尼亚的冶金工人在今年头五个月内已经超计划多生产了五万多吨钢、一万六千多吨生铁和二万六千多吨钢材。为了向节日献礼，他们又提高了增产指标。例如，全国最大的钢铁工业企业洪尼多阿拉冶金联合工厂的炼焦工人决定比原订年度生产计划再多炼五万吨焦炭，轧钢工人决定多生产一千吨钢材。累希擦联合工厂的工人计划多生产二千八百吨生铁，并且继续降低每吨钢的成本。
    斯大林州的三十个冶金和机器制造企业最近联合举行了一次生产会议，决定在“最高的劳动生产率、最低的成本、最好的产品质量”的口号下，进一步开展社会主义劳动竞赛运动。这个州的恩斯特·台尔曼拖拉机工厂准备在节日前节约三百万列伊，多生产三十五部发动机。工厂的青年生产队还倡议全国的青年生产队都争取成为先进的劳动集体，目前已有许多工厂的青年生产队响应了这个号召。
    化学工业部门正在以加速建设许多新的化学工厂和车间的实际行动来迎接节日。石油钻井工人在今年头五个月内超计划钻进二万公尺，他们现在又以更快的钻井速度进行工作。炼油工人也订出了迎接节日的新计划，普罗也什蒂第一炼油厂的工人决定比原计划多节约一千二百吨石油。
    轻工业和食品工业部门也都决定提高设备利用率，降低生产成本，供应居民更多的纺织品和食品等。
