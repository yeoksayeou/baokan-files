Xinhua News Agency, June 27th, Trujillo City Dispatch: In the past week, the Dominican anti-dictatorial armed forces have continued to fight government troops on three fronts: north, central, and west. According to an announcement on June 26th by the Dominican anti-government radio station, Dominican anti-dictatorial armed forces recently eliminated seventy-six government cavalry in the Constanza region of central Dominican Republic. On June 24th, this radio station announced that many government troops had defected to the anti-dictatorial forces during combat. The radio station said that the dictatorial government is conducting frenzied bombing of the anti-dictatorial forces, but they have suffered no losses. Currently, the people of Constanza and Santiago de los Caballeros, which are occupied by the anti-dictatorial forces, are celebrating their victories.

Santiago de los Caballeros was occupied by anti-government forces not long after Constanza. The city is located eighty-five miles from the capital and is the second largest city in the Dominican Republic. It is reported that after occupying the city, the anti-government forces destroyed the statues of the dictator Trujillo. News also says that the anti-government forces occupied the mountain strongholds near the city.

According to a communique issued on June 22nd by the New York headquarters of the "Dominican Liberation Movement," anti-dictatorial armed forces and government troops have engaged in continuous battles in the central part of the republic, northwest of Constanza, in which the government forces suffered more than five hundred casualties.

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, June 26th: The Cuban government today announced the severance of diplomatic relations with the Dominican Republic.

In a note submitted to the Dominican Republic, the Cuban government accused the Dominican government of refusing to extradite the dictator Batista and other Cuban war criminals, and of refusing to return the four aircraft that Batista and his followers took when they fled to the Dominican Republic on the eve of the Cuban revolution. The note also accused the Dominican government of using machine guns and aircraft to massacre unarmed Dominican civilians while fighting domestic anti-dictatorial armed forces.

Relations between Cuba and the Dominican Republic had begun to deteriorate long ago. Prime Minister Castro has repeatedly condemned the dictator Trujillo for harboring Batista's criminals. He pointed out that the dictator Batista and his followers, with the help of the United States and the Dominican governments, have been plotting military conspiracies to attack Cuba.

According to reports, the day before Cuba announced the severance of diplomatic relations with the Dominican Republic, the commander of the U.S. Guantanamo Naval Base in Cuba, Frank Pheno, led a fleet to the Dominican Republic for a "visit." That evening, the dictator Trujillo hosted a grand banquet for his guests, attended by four hundred people. Prior to this, the fleet had been "patrolling" in Dominican waters for several days.

    反独裁武装斗争继续进行
    多米尼加政府军纷纷倒戈
    古巴宣布同多米尼加断绝外交关系
    新华社27日讯　特鲁希略城消息：最近一周，多米尼加反独裁武装部队继续在北部、中部和西部三条战线上和政府军进行战斗。据多米尼加反政府方面的电台26日宣布，多米尼加反独裁武装部队最近在中部康斯坦萨地区消灭了七十六名政府骑兵。这家电台在24日宣布，许多政府军队在作战中倒向了反独裁部队方面。电台说，独裁政府正在对反独裁部队进行疯狂轰炸，但是他们没有遭到损失。目前，由反独裁部队占领的康斯坦萨镇和圣地亚哥德洛斯卡巴列罗斯城的人民正在欢庆他们所获得的胜利。
    圣地亚哥德洛斯卡巴列罗斯是继康斯坦萨之后被反政府部队不久前占领的。这个城离首都八十五英里，是多米尼加第二个大城市。据报道，反政府部队在占领这个城市之后，曾击毁特鲁希略独裁者的雕像。消息还说，反政府部队占领了这个城市附近的山区据点。
    据“多米尼加解放运动”纽约总部22日发表的公报说，反独裁武装部队和政府军曾在共和国中部、康斯坦萨西北部地区连续发生战斗，在这些战斗中，政府军方面共死伤五百多人。
    新华社哈瓦那26日电　古巴政府今天宣布断绝同多米尼加的外交关系。
    古巴政府在提交给多米尼加的一份照会里指责多米尼加政府拒绝引渡独裁者巴蒂斯塔和其他古巴战犯，拒绝交还巴蒂斯塔及其随从者在古巴革命胜利前夕逃往多米尼加时所乘坐的四架飞机。照会还指责多米尼加政府在同国内反独裁武装部队作战时用机枪和飞机屠杀手无寸铁的多米尼加平民。
    古巴和多米尼加之间的关系早就开始恶化了。卡斯特罗总理曾多次谴责特鲁希略独裁者在庇护巴蒂斯塔罪犯。他指出，独裁者巴蒂斯塔及其随从者在美国和多米尼加政府的帮助下，一直在策动进攻古巴的军事阴谋。
    据报道，就在古巴宣布同多米尼加断绝外交关系的前一天，美国在古巴的关塔那摩海军基地的总司令弗兰克·菲诺曾率领一支舰队到多米尼加进行“访问”。当晚，独裁者特鲁希略大摆筵席款待客人，出席宴会的达四百人。在这以前，这支舰队在多米尼加海面“巡逻”了好几天。
