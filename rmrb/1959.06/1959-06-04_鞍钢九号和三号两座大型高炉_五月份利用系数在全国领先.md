Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, June 3rd. Anshan Iron and Steel's No. 9 and No. 3 large blast furnaces won the championship and runner-up respectively among the nation's large blast furnaces (with a volume of 500 cubic meters or more) in the Red May campaign. The average monthly utilization coefficients of the two blast furnaces reached 2.187 and 2.133 respectively. They both overfulfilled their May production plans ahead of schedule by one day. No. 9 blast furnace produced an extra two thousand tons of pig iron for the state and saved more than one thousand nine hundred tons of coke. No. 3 blast furnace produced an average of one hundred and fourteen tons of pig iron more per day than in April.

These two blast furnaces had already achieved excellent results in April. At that time, the utilization coefficient of No. 9 blast furnace averaged 2.051. No. 3 blast furnace, closely following No. 9, also achieved a utilization coefficient of 1.995. In May, they were determined to raise the red flag even higher and win the national championship for large blast furnaces. They chased each other and strived to be the best. No. 3 blast furnace learned from the experience of No. 9, increased the blast volume, and enhanced the smelting intensity. By May 10th, the utilization coefficient of the blast furnace had jumped to 2.170, surpassing No. 9. In order to win back the championship, the workers of No. 9 blast furnace further increased the hot blast temperature and reduced the coke ratio. On May 20th, the utilization coefficient of the blast furnace was steadily increased to 2.176, surpassing No. 3 blast furnace again.

The significant increase in the utilization coefficients of Anshan Iron and Steel's No. 9 and No. 3 blast furnaces, like the increase in the utilization coefficients of Benxi's large and medium-sized blast furnaces, relied not only on the hard work of the blast furnace workers, but also on the unity and cooperation of the workers in the mines, coking plants, sintering plants, and power departments, thereby creating favorable conditions in all aspects.

    鞍钢九号和三号两座大型高炉
    五月份利用系数在全国领先
    新华社鞍山3日电　鞍钢九号和三号两座大型高炉在红五月里获得全国大型高炉（容积五百立方公尺以上）的冠军和亚军。两座高炉的月平均利用系数分别达到二点一八七和二点一三三。他们都提前一天超额完成了5月份生产计划，九号高炉为国家增产了两千吨生铁，节约焦炭一千九百多吨；三号高炉比4月份每天平均增产一百一十四吨生铁。
    这两座高炉在4月份就创造了优异的成绩。当时，九高炉的利用系数平均达到二点零五一；紧接在九高炉后面的三高炉，利用系数也达到了一点九九五。5月份，他们决心把红旗举得更高，夺取全国大型高炉冠军。他们你追我赶，力争上游。三高炉学习九高炉的经验，加大鼓风量，提高冶炼强度，到5月10日高炉利用系数曾经跃进到二点一七零，赶过了九高炉。九号高炉职工为了夺回冠军，又进一步提高了热风温度和降低焦比。5月20日把高炉的利用系数稳步提高到二点一七六，重新赶过了三高炉。
    鞍钢第九和第三高炉利用系数的大大提高，同本溪大型高炉和中型高炉利用系数的提高一样，除了高炉职工的辛勤劳动以外，还依靠了他们和矿山、炼焦厂、烧结厂及动力等部门职工的团结协作，因而在各方面创造了有利条件。
