Singaporean Leaders Elaborate on Policy Guidelines
Striving for Full Independence in Four Years

(Reported by this newspaper) The newly established Singaporean self-governing government's Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew and Deputy Prime Minister Toh Chin Chye have recently made speeches, elaborating on the government's policy guidelines.

When discussing Singapore's relationship with Malaya and Britain, Lee Kuan Yew said that the newly established autonomous government will seek full independence for Singapore in four years, at which time it is hard to believe that the British naval base will remain in Singapore. Lee Kuan Yew believes that Singapore will eventually "merge with the Federation of Malaya." Currently, the relationship between Singapore and the Federation of Malaya is still in "a transitional period, the duration of which" is "still unknown." He said that the Singapore Autonomous Government and the Federation of Malaya government have many things in common, "including opposition to communism"; the only difference is in the "form and emphasis issues" of opposing communism.

In a recent speech, Toh Chin Chye elaborated on the government's domestic policies. He said that one of the main things the Singapore Autonomous Government intends to do is to give "a multi-ethnic society a spirit that belongs to one nation," and "particular attention should be paid to instilling national consciousness in schools." He said that restructuring the non-productive trade economy to make it a productive economy is another key policy of the government.

Since the establishment of the Singapore Autonomous Government, it has taken several measures to implement the above-mentioned policies. In mid-June, Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew held talks with Malayan Prime Minister Razak. The communique emphasized the issue of maintaining ethnic harmony in the two regions. Earlier this month, the Singapore Ministry of Culture, the Ministry of Home Affairs, and the Ministry of Education successively made decisions on banning yellow publications, prohibiting the broadcast of Western pornographic music, and banning the screening of yellow films. In a statement issued on the 8th, the Minister of Home Affairs pointed out that "Singapore under colonial rule has not only suffered economic and political losses, but also cultural destruction." The statement said that the Ministry of Home Affairs, in coordination with the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of Education, will adopt a two-pronged policy, on the one hand, to ban pornography, and on the other hand, to seek to creatively cultivate a healthy culture based on Malayan perspectives.

    新加坡领导人阐述政策方针
    争取四年后充分独立
    本报讯　新成立的新加坡自治政府总理李光耀、副总理杜进才最近先后发表谈话，阐明政府的政策方针。
    李光耀在谈到新加坡同马来亚、英国的关系时说，新成立的自治政府将在四年以后为新加坡谋求充分的独立，那时就很难相信英国海军基地还会留在新加坡。李光耀认为，新加坡终将“同马来亚联合邦合并”。目前，新加坡和马来亚联合邦的关系还处在“一个过渡时期，这个时期将有多久”，现在“尚不知道”。他说，新加坡自治政府和马来亚联合邦政府有很多共同的东西，“其中包括反对共产主义”；唯一的不同是在反对共产主义的“形式和重点问题上”。
    杜进才在最近一次谈话中，阐述了政府的对内政策。他说，新加坡自治政府打算做的主要事情之一，是要使“多种民族的社会具有属于一个民族的一种精神”，“特别要重视的是在学校中灌输民族觉悟”。他说，改组非生产性的贸易经济，使它成为生产性的经济是政府的另一个政策要点。
    新加坡自治政府成立以来，已经采取了若干措施以贯彻上述施政方针。本月中旬，李光耀总理曾和马来亚总理拉扎克举行会谈。会谈公报强调保持两个地区民族和睦的问题。本月上旬，新加坡文化部、内政部和教育部先后就取缔黄色刊物、禁止播送西方色情音乐、禁映黄色电影等问题作出决定。内政部长在8日发表的一项声明指出，“在殖民统治下的新加坡不仅在经济和政治上受到损失，而且在文化上也遭到破坏”。声明说，内政部同文化部和教育部配合，将采取双管齐下的政策，一方面取缔色情文化，另一方面谋求创造性的培养一个以马来亚观点为基础的健康的文化。
