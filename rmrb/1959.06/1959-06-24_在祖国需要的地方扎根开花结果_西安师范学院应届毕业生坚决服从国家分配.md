Taking Root and Bearing Fruit Where the Motherland Needs Us
Xi'an Normal College Graduates Resolutely Obey National Assignment

According to the *Shaanxi Daily* news: The four hundred and fifty-two graduating students of Xi'an Normal College have been paying more attention to improving their political ideology and studying harder on the eve of graduation. They have written guarantees to the Party, expressing their firm obedience to national assignment and embarking on the glorious post of people's teachers. They said, "The needs of the motherland are my aspirations." "Wherever the Party points, I will rush there." "Take root, blossom, and bear fruit in the place where the motherland needs me most."

The four hundred-plus students graduating from Xi'an Normal College this year have greatly improved their academic quality, having initially mastered the cultural and scientific knowledge that a middle school teacher should possess. Over the past few years, they have systematically completed the nationally prescribed professional courses and other required courses. By participating in productive labor on and off campus, and going to the countryside to help carry out the cultural revolution, the students have further consolidated and enriched their classroom knowledge, and their ideological level has also been greatly improved. Therefore, they have further realized the importance of teachers' work, consolidated their professional thinking, and strengthened their determination to serve education.

Among the four hundred-plus graduating students, more than 80% are Party or League members, with relatively high political quality. Many students have been paying more attention to improving their political ideology on the eve of graduation. They have been actively reporting their ideological situation to the Party and League organizations and applying to join the League and the Party. In addition to all participating in Party classes, nine students in the Physics Department actively applied to join the League; among the twenty-four League members, fifteen have submitted applications to join the Party.

The students feel infinitely honored and proud to be able to take on the noble teaching post in the year of the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, nurturing the new generation of the motherland. In order to repay the Party and the state for their patient cultivation, and in order to be able to achieve excellent results quickly after taking up their posts, they are studying even harder. Currently, they are carrying out a comprehensive analysis and familiarization with middle school teaching materials. Graduating students from the Chinese Department have written more than 100 articles analyzing middle school texts of various styles. After conducting investigations in five middle schools in Xi'an, students from the Political Education Department are actively compiling middle school political teaching materials. Students from the Mathematics Department are also stepping up their review of lessons. They have put forward the resounding slogan of "Reviewing until understood, until thorough, until deep, leaving no difficulties unaddressed." In just two weeks, they have reviewed high school trigonometry and algebra.

The Party and government leaders of Xi'an Normal College attach great importance to the assignment and ideological education of graduating students. The school has established a special graduate student work committee to be specifically responsible for the work of graduates. In addition to carrying out meticulous ideological education for graduates, they also organize report meetings, discussion meetings, go to middle schools to investigate and research the situation, and invite alumni to return to school to hold seminars with graduates, etc., to help graduates better understand middle school teaching work.

    在祖国需要的地方扎根开花结果
    西安师范学院应届毕业生坚决服从国家分配
    据陕西日报消息：西安师范学院的四百五十二名应届毕业学生，在毕业前夕，更加重视提高自己的政治思想，更加刻苦学习。他们纷纷向党写保证书，表示坚决服从国家分配，走上光荣的人民教师工作岗位。他们说：“祖国的需要就是我的志愿”。“党指向那里，就奔向那里”。“在祖国最需要的地方扎根、开花、结果”。
    西安师范学院今年毕业的四百多位同学，学习质量都大有提高，初步掌握了一个中学教师应具备的文化科学知识。几年来，他们系统地学完了国家规定的专业课和其他必修课。同学们通过在校内外参加生产劳动，下乡帮助开展文化革命，更进一步巩固和丰富了课堂知识，思想水平也大大提高。因此，他们进一步体会到教师工作的重要，巩固了专业思想，坚定了为教育工作服务的决心。
    应届毕业的四百多个学生中，80％以上都是党团员，政治质量比较高。许多同学在毕业前夕，更加重视提高自己的政治思想。他们主动地向党团组织汇报自己的思想情况，申请入团入党。物理系同学除全部参加了党课学习外，九名同学积极申请入团；二十四名团员中，已有十五人提出了入党申请。
    同学们为他们能在祖国建国十周年的年代里，走上崇高的教师岗位，抚育祖国新的一代，感到无限光荣和自豪。为了报答党和国家对自己的耐心培养，为了在走上工作岗位后，很快就能做出优异成绩，他们更加刻苦的学习着。目前，他们开展了一个全面的分析和熟悉中学教材的活动。语文系毕业同学，已写出分析中学各种体裁课文的文章一百多篇。政教系的同学，在西安市五所中学进行了调查后，正在积极编写中学政治教材。数学系同学，也正在加紧复习功课。他们提出：“复懂、复透、复深、疑难点一个不漏”的响亮口号。仅仅两周的时间，他们就复习好了高中三角学和代数学。
    西安师范学院的党政领导，对于应届毕业生的分配工作和思想教育工作非常重视。学校专门成立了毕业学生工作委员会，具体负责毕业生的工作。除了对毕业生进行细致的思想教育外，还组织报告会、讨论会，到中学调查研究情况，邀请校友返校同毕业生开座谈会等，以帮助毕业生更好地理解中学教学工作。
