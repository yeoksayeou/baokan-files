    A Record of Presenting Treasure from Rice Husks
    By Our Correspondent Gāo Chángrèn
    Since August of last year, rice processing factories in Changsha City, Hunan Province, have added a new business: in addition to processing rice into polished rice, they have also built various types of dry distillation furnaces on open spaces to dry distill large quantities of rice husks, producing a brownish-yellow mixture. These mixtures are sent to the Red Flag Chemical Factory of the No. 3 Warehouse of the Municipal Grain Bureau for further processing and refining, from which various chemical raw materials can be obtained. Currently, Changsha City uses rice husks as raw materials to produce methanol, acetone, phenolic oil, vinegar stone, asphalt, activated carbon, and water glass in batches, totaling seven products. In April, the total output value of chemical raw materials made from rice husks by the city's grain departments reached more than 23,000 yuan.
    Hunan Province, which is rich in rice production, has an inexhaustible supply of rice husks. Every year after the autumn harvest, the rice husks at the Changsha City rice processing factories pile up like mountains. Besides being used as fuel and warehouse padding, they are almost impossible to handle. Sometimes, when they accumulate too much, they have to spend transportation capacity to ship them out. Now, thanks to the hard work of the vast number of employees in the grain department, the useless waste of the past has finally been turned into a versatile resource.
    The idea of extracting chemical raw materials from rice husks was not first discovered by the Changsha City Grain Bureau. However, the Changsha City Grain Bureau took the lead in moving from laboratory experiments to batch production.
    In June last year, the Changsha City Grain Bureau organized a visiting group to learn advanced experiences in grain storage and transportation in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and other provinces. They saw a novel thing in the laboratory of the Wuxi City Grain Bureau. There, rice husks were used as raw materials to make glass and furfural and other chemical raw materials. This aroused great interest among the visiting group. They knew that Changsha wasted a large number of rice husks every year. If these chemical raw materials could be extracted from rice husks, wouldn't it increase a lot of wealth for the country? At that time, there was a laboratory technician in the visiting group who quickly learned the technology.
    After returning to Changsha, the Party Leadership Group of the Grain Bureau attached great importance to this matter and designated Changsha No. 3 Warehouse to be responsible for this work, requiring them to achieve results in the laboratory first.
    Faced with such a brand-new job, the employees of No. 3 Warehouse took it as a glorious task. After ten days of effort, they extracted furfural and other chemical raw materials from rice husks, made a dark green glass, and asked the Changsha Glass Factory to help make four teacups. On July 1st, they excitedly took these products to present them to the Party.
    One of the teacups was sent to the Changsha Municipal Party Committee. The Municipal Party Committee quickly held two on-site meetings at the No. 3 Warehouse to teach their method of dry distilling rice husks to extract mixed liquids to various rice mills. Within three days, all the rice mills learned and applied the method of dry distilling rice husks to extract mixed liquids. This was the first step in extracting chemical raw materials from rice husks. After the rice mills took action, many street residents also started doing it. At that time, people were very enthusiastic, and the tools used were also various. At the beginning of the experiment, the iron shells of fire extinguishers were used for dry distillation. Later, the rice mills used old gasoline drums for dry distillation, and the street residents felt that the cost of old gasoline drums was too high, so they used pottery urns and pottery jars instead. Regardless of the tools used, because everyone learned the operating methods, they could produce mixed liquids. By the end of July, more than 10,000 catties of mixed liquids had been extracted throughout the city. Later, the rice mills officially built various types of dry distillation furnaces, and the output of mixed liquids became even higher.
    With the mass production of mixed liquids, the first hurdle in extracting chemical raw materials from rice husks was broken. However, a new contradiction also followed, because the mixed liquid was mixed with more than a dozen chemical components, which had to be fractionated to obtain different chemical raw materials. Otherwise, they were just some brownish-yellow water, and still poisonous.
    At that time, only the laboratory of the No. 3 Warehouse could fractionate the mixed liquid. They could only process 20 to 30 catties of mixed liquid per day, and only obtained three products: methanol, furfural, and asphalt. At this time, how to quickly build a fractionation factory and process this batch of mixed liquid in time became a very prominent issue.
    To solve this key problem, experienced senior technicians were needed. At that time, the Grain Bureau did not have such engineers. They went to East China for the third time to learn from experience and asked the Ministry of Grain and the Ministry of Chemical Industry to send senior technicians to support them.
    Before the fractionation problem was solved, the mixed liquid in the city was still being produced every day, and the situation was really pressing. The Grain Bureau decided to start with indigenous methods. They asked the technical cadres of the Scientific Research Office of the Provincial Grain Department to help, and the employees also provided their experimental experience in the laboratory. Everyone explored and designed a simple factory building. As soon as there was an inkling of progress, the employees became motivated. They built the factory building in four days, found ways to get equipment, and found materials. Originally, a set of acid-resistant ceramic pipes was needed for the distillation tower, but they could not order the goods from Yixing, Jiangsu Province, so they bought ordinary ceramic pipes from local pottery shops to replace them. The Provincial Grain Department had a set of alcohol distillation towers that were not being used temporarily, so they borrowed them. Thanks to the cooperation and support of many units, when the technicians from the Ministry of Grain, the Ministry of Chemical Industry, and the rice husk comprehensive utilization research cooperation group composed of teachers and students from Peking University and Beijing Normal University arrived in Changsha, Changsha's small fractionation factory was already taking shape.
    The arrival of a group of senior technicians from Beijing was like sending charcoal in the snow. With their help, this small fractionation factory began trial production in early November. Of course, this was a brand-new thing, and no one had any experience. After trial production, many shortcomings were still found that needed to be improved. Needless to say, in solving many technical problems of fractionation, whether it was the old engineers, the energetic college students, or the hard-working cadres and workers, everyone racked their brains and spent many sleepless nights. In this way, everyone pooled their wisdom and efforts, and finally broke through the difficult hurdle of fractionation. In March of this year, this experimental factory was officially named the Red Flag Chemical Factory. The equipment in the factory has increased from one furnace to two furnaces, fractionating about 5,000 catties of mixed liquid every day, which can basically process all the mixed liquid produced in the city every day. The seven kinds of chemical raw materials fractionated by this factory have been underwritten by the Changsha Industrial Equipment Purchasing Station. The products are all up to standard, and the factories concerned have used the chemical raw materials they produce in production.
    A month ago, the Ministry of Grain and the Ministry of Chemical Industry held a technical experience exchange meeting on rice husk dry distillation in Changsha. Representatives from all over the country visited their factory and learned their experience, and warmly praised their achievements. This gave great encouragement to all the employees of the Changsha City Grain Department. The person in charge of the Changsha City Grain Bureau told reporters that they were honored for the achievements they had made in a year of struggle, but they were not proud. At this experience and technology exchange meeting, they also learned a lot of valuable experience from the reports and speeches of fraternal provinces and cities, because they still have many new problems to solve on the road ahead. The advanced experience of fraternal units is very useful to them.
    Let the rice husks that were useless in the past serve us better. The current achievements of comprehensive utilization of rice husks in Changsha City are only providing us with a vivid example. It will not be long before rice husks in the rice-producing areas of the South can contribute a lot of wealth to us. (Attached picture)

    稻壳献宝记
    本报记者　高长任
    去年8月，湖南省长沙市的各个粮食加工厂都增添了一项新业务：除了把稻谷加工成大米之外，还在空地上建起不同类型的干馏炉子，把大批稻壳进行干馏，生产一种棕黄色的混合液；这些混合液送到市粮食局三仓库的红旗化工厂里再加工提炼，便可得到多种化工原料。现在，长沙市用稻糠作原料，已经成批生产甲醇、丙酮、酚油、醋石、柏油、活性碳、水玻璃七种产品。4月份，全市粮食部门用稻壳制成的化工原料，总产值达到二万三千多元。
    盛产稻谷的湖南省，稻壳可以说是用之不尽的，每年秋收之后，长沙市大米加工厂的稻壳堆积如山，除了作燃料和垫仓库等用途外，简直无法处理，有时堆积得太多，还得花费运力把它运输出去。现在，由于粮食部门广大职工的刻苦钻研，终于使过去的无用之物，变为一种用途很广的资源。
    从稻壳中提炼化工原料，不是长沙市粮食局首先发现的。但从实验室试验到成批生产，长沙市粮食局是先走了一步。
    去年6月，长沙市粮食局组织了一个参观团，到江苏、浙江等省学习粮食保管、调运工作的先进经验，他们在无锡市粮食局化验室看到一件新鲜的事情。那里用稻壳作原料，制成了玻璃和糠醛等化工原料。这件事引起参观团的极大兴趣，他们知道长沙每年都有大批的稻壳白白浪费掉了，如果能从稻壳中提炼出这些化工原料来，不是能为国家增加很多财富吗？当时参观团里有个化验人员，他很快就学会了这套技术。
    回到长沙以后，粮食局党组很重视这件事，于是就指定长沙第三仓库负责这项工作，并要求他们首先在化验室里做出成绩来。
    面对这样崭新的工作，三仓库的职工都把它当作光荣的任务担当起来了。经过十天的努力，他们从稻壳中提炼出糠醛等化工原料，制成了一种暗绿色的玻璃，并请长沙玻璃厂帮助，制成四只茶杯。7月1日他们兴奋地把这些产品拿来向党献礼。
    有一只茶杯送到了中共长沙市委会，市委很快就在三仓库召开两次现场会，把他们用稻壳干馏的操作方法传授给各米厂；三天之内，各米厂都学会并运用了稻壳干馏提取混合液的方法。这是从稻壳中提炼化工原料的第一步。米厂行动起来以后，不少街道居民也干起来了。当时，人们的热情很高，使用的工具也是各式各样；开始试验时，是用灭火机的铁壳来干馏的；以后，各米厂就用旧汽油桶来干馏，街道居民嫌旧汽油筒成本高，就用陶坛、陶缸来代替。不管用什么工具，由于大家学会了操作方法，都能生产出混合液来；到7月底，全市已经提炼了一万多斤混合液。以后，各米厂又正式兴建各式各样的干馏炉子，混合液的产量就更高了。
    混合液成批生产，用稻壳提炼化工原料的第一个关口就突破了。但是，一个新的矛盾也跟着出现，因为混合液里混合着十几种化学成分，必须在分馏之后，才能得到不同的化工原料，否则，只是一些棕黄色的水而已，而且还是有毒的。
    当时，能够对混合液进行分馏的，只有三仓库的化验室，他们每天也只能处理二、三十斤混合液，得到的只有甲醇、糠醛、柏油三种产品。这个时候，如何迅速建立一个分馏工厂，及时处理这批混合液，就成为一个非常突出的问题。
    要解决这个关键问题，就需要有经验的高级技术人员，当时粮食局没有这样的工程师，他们又第三次到华东去学习经验，并请粮食部和化工部派高级技术人员来支援。
    在分馏问题未解决以前，市内混合液仍在天天生产，形势真是逼人，粮食局决定先用土法上马。他们请省粮食厅科学研究室的技术干部来帮助，职工们也提供了他们在化验室的实验的经验，大家摸索着设计了一个简单的厂房。事情一有个眉目，职工们的干劲就来了，他们四天就盖好了厂房，想办法搞设备，找材料，本来需要一套耐酸陶管搞蒸馏塔的，可是到江苏省的宜兴订不到货，他们就在本地陶器店里买了普通陶管来代替。省粮食厅有一套酒精蒸馏塔，暂时没有使用，也被他们借来。由于争取了许多单位的协作和支援，因此，当粮食部、化工部的技术人员和北京大学、北京师范大学师生组成的稻壳综合利用研究协作组到达长沙时，长沙市的小型分馏工厂已经初具规模了。
    北京来的一批高级技术人员到达长沙，正如雪中送炭，在他们的帮助下，这个小型分馏工厂在11月上月就开始试生产了。当然，这是崭新的事情，谁也没有经验，试生产以后，还是发现许多缺点，要加以改进的，不用说，在解决许多分馏的技术问题上，不论是年老的工程师，朝气勃勃的大学生，还是辛勤工作的干部和工人，大家都绞过不少脑汁，度过很多个不眠的夜晚，就这样群策群力，大家终于突破了分馏这道难关。今年3月份，这个试验性工厂已正式命名为红旗化工厂，厂里的设备由一个炉子增加到二个炉子，每天分馏五千斤左右的混合液，基本上可以把全市每天生产的混合液处理完。这个工厂分馏出来的七种化工原料，已经为长沙市工业器材采购站包销。产品都合乎规格，有关工厂都把他们生产的化工原料，用到生产上去了。
    一个月以前，由粮食部、化工部在长沙召开了稻壳干馏技术经验交流会，来自各地的代表参观了他们的工厂，学习他们的经验，对他们的成就热烈地赞扬。这给长沙市粮食部门的全体职工很大的鼓舞。长沙市粮食局的负责人告诉记者，他们对于奋斗一年获得的成就感到光荣，但并没有骄傲。在这一次经验技术交流会上，他们从兄弟省市的报告和发言中，也学习到很多宝贵经验，因为他们在前进的道路上，还有不少新的问题要解决。兄弟单位的先进经验对他们都是很有用处的。
    让过去没有用处的稻壳为我们更好地服务吧，长沙市目前综合利用稻壳的成就，只是为我们提供了一个活生生的例子。不要很长时间，在南方产稻地区，稻壳都可以为我们贡献大量的财富的。（附图片）
