Everyone Walks the Path Once Trod
By our reporter Zhou Yongkang

In Shanghai, there is a factory that, despite having fewer raw materials, has exceeded its monthly plan every month, with each month surpassing the previous one. The number of people coming from various places to learn from their experience is also increasing daily. Although teaching these production experiences to others will make their own raw materials even more scarce, they still selflessly help others, demonstrating a high degree of communist spirit.

This factory is the Shanghai Biochemical Pharmaceutical Factory. They have found many new raw materials and have opened up a broad path in biochemical pharmaceutical production. People call this factory the "Pioneer," both to express their praise and to use them as a model for learning.

The Road Suddenly Narrows

The Shanghai Biochemical Pharmaceutical Factory has never had a shortage of raw materials in the past. In 1956, after the merger of four small pharmaceutical factories, it became a factory specializing in the production of medicines using pig organs. It was considered the largest in scale and the most diverse in products in the country. Other factories sometimes had to worry about raw materials when increasing production, but this factory, because it used pig organs, always had an ample supply.

Around this time last year, at an on-site conference on the comprehensive utilization of pig organs held by the Ministry of Commerce in Shanghai, the Shanghai Biochemical Pharmaceutical Factory introduced its experience in using pig organs to make medicines, which aroused great interest. Soon after the conference ended, batches of people came to the factory to visit and intern. At first, they didn't feel anything was amiss. In principle, Shanghai is a base for China's pharmaceutical industry, and helping other regions is an unshirkable responsibility. However, later on, the following situation emerged: as the number of units visiting increased on the factory director's registration book, the regions that originally supplied them with raw materials decreased day by day in the supply and marketing department's material receiving book. Instead of tons of pig organs, large numbers of banners and letters of thanks were sent by various places. It turned out that after learning from the experience, various places had set up biochemical pharmaceutical factories, and the raw materials originally sent to Shanghai were now being used by themselves.

Breaking Out of the Narrow Circle

This matter naturally aroused everyone's concern. Some said: This is terrible! We taught the technology to others, and their road is getting wider and wider, while our road is getting narrower and narrower. Some even suggested that the leadership quickly investigate which places do not yet have biochemical pharmaceutical factories, move the factory as soon as possible, because there is no future in Shanghai. However, some workers had different views. They said: Our factory is called the Biochemical Pharmaceutical Factory, so why are we just circling around pigs? The scope of biology is so broad, are we still afraid of not finding raw materials? This is indeed a good idea. In February, a campaign to expand new raw materials was launched throughout the factory. Workers and technicians worked hard for several days and finally used human hair to produce two medicines for treating hepatitis and hepatic coma – cysteine and alanine. This shot was a success, and everyone's confidence was boosted, and their enthusiasm soared. Workers Xi Tongshu and Zhang Shuisheng remembered that in the past, in the leather factory, they had seen the surface and inner layers of the pigskin scraped off and discarded when tanning the leather, so they rushed to the leather factory and took some scraps back to try, and it could also be used to produce a medicine called peptone (an important raw material for chlortetracycline). When the factory was making another medicine called pancreatin without pig pancreas, workers Mao Zusong and Le Guozhen went to the small vegetable market early every morning to collect duck and chicken pancreas. However, they could only collect a few pounds a day, which was not enough. They came up with an idea. Aren't there several food factories in Shanghai that specialize in making canned chicken and duck meat? There must be a lot of it there. The two of them went to visit Yimin, Taikang, and Meilin food factories separately, and sure enough, it was as expected. Taikang Food Factory gave them more than 50 kilograms of duck pancreas at one time, and the yield of making pancreatin with these duck pancreas was actually half higher than that of pig pancreas. Lu Baoqi, a cadre of the supply and marketing department, heard from the laboratory personnel that the urine of pregnant women can also be used to make a medicine that promotes animal function. He first contacted the textile factory, but the textile factory felt that it was difficult to collect the urine of pregnant women, and no one would send it even if it was collected. Lu Baoqi was not discouraged at all, and turned around and rushed to several nearby neighborhoods to ask for help from the neighborhood committees. The cadres of the neighborhood committees also felt that this was a novelty, and readily agreed. Lu Baoqi gave them the roughly processed medicinal liquid and also taught them the processing method. At present, more than 200 neighborhood committees in more than a dozen districts of the city are collecting this inexhaustible raw material for the biochemical pharmaceutical factory, so that the factory can receive more than 6,000 kilograms of roughly processed products every month.

As a result of widely opening up channels to find raw materials, this factory has now broken out of the scope of pig organs and has extracted more raw materials from the biological world. They have also extracted various medicinal raw materials from wool, fish milt, garlic, bean flour, and soybean sprouts. These days, they are also studying using seaweed to make medicines, preparing to march towards the ocean and ask the sea to offer treasures! They originally planned to trial-produce 52 new medicines this year. After finding these raw materials, about 30 types have been successfully trial-produced by mid-June.

Just as new medicines were being successfully trial-produced one after another, new problems came again. In recent months, the factory has often encountered such things: they have just made a product with new raw materials, and today it is published in the newspaper, tomorrow someone comes to ask for exchange of experience, and the day after tomorrow, there is no such raw material on the market.

Towards a Broader Avenue

This is truly a serious test! The staff of the Biochemical Pharmaceutical Factory are indeed in a bit of a dilemma. If they don't teach, they can't say it; if they teach again, the raw materials will inevitably be affected. No matter how many banners and letters of thanks there are, they cannot be used as raw materials!

The factory leadership fully understands the feelings of the employees, but if this ideology is not resolved, it will not only affect the relationship with other places, but also hinder its own improvement. The factory's Party organization first examined various localist thoughts among the cadres, and then launched a mass discussion on a question: Even if we have difficulties, should we still help others? The vast majority of employees said: We have difficulties, but we cannot close the door. If others learn it, they will also produce it, which will only benefit the country and the people. If we don't have raw materials, we can find others; besides, we have many experiences that were taught by others in the past. We cannot only ask others to promote the spirit of cooperation, but hide our tricks.

Once everyone's thinking was clear, they no longer complained and complained, but tried every means to make the interns learn quickly and well. In order to achieve this, the factory leadership transferred a workshop director who was familiar with the entire factory's production to be specifically responsible for this work. A silk factory in Wuxi sent three interns, who said they wanted to learn a method of making peptone from silkworm pupae when they came. But once they arrived here, they were attracted by many medicines and wanted to learn more types, but they were embarrassed to say so. Later, Party Branch Secretary Shen Qun learned of their wishes and rearranged their internship plan. As a result, in addition to learning the original method, the three people also learned the manufacturing technology of several other medicines, such as bacterial enzyme and water-soluble protein. After many regions sent people to learn and set up pharmaceutical factories, some even sent the first batch of samples to Shanghai to ask them to help test and identify them. Every time the workers received a sample, they said with joy: Our country has another factory, and our factory has another peer.

Now, let's take a look at the scene inside and outside the factory director's office! Inside, there is a production record board, which states: Compared with May this year and May last year, when raw materials were very abundant, the output value has increased from 200,000 to 900,000. It is estimated that by the end of June, about 75% of the annual national plan can be completed. They have used the spirit of communism to open up an infinitely broad and prosperous road for themselves.

    踏出道路大家走
    本报记者　周永康
    上海有一家工厂，在原料来源较少的情况下，月月超额完成了计划，而且一个月比一个月高；各地来学习经验的也一天比一天多，虽然这些生产经验教给别人以后，会使自己的原料更加困难，可是他们仍然毫无保留地帮助别人，发扬了高度的共产主义精神。
    这个厂，就是上海生物化学制药厂。因为他们找到了许多种新原料，在生物制药方面开辟了一条广阔的道路。人们都把这个厂叫做“开路先锋”，一则表示对他们的赞扬，二则把他们作为学习的榜样。
    路子忽然变窄了
    上海生物药厂过去从来没有发生过原料不足的情况。1956年，这个厂由四个小药厂合并经营以后，就成为一座专门利用猪内脏制造药品的工厂。在国内要算他们规模最大，品种最多。别的厂过去在提高生产时，有时还不免要为原料操心，而这个厂因为用的是猪内脏，原料总是绰绰有余。
    去年这个时候。商业部在上海召开的一个综合利用猪内脏的现场会议上，上海生物化学制药厂介绍了他们利用猪内脏做药品的经验，引起了人们极大的兴趣。会议结束不久，这个厂的大门口就出现了一批又一批前来参观实习的人。开始的时候，他们也没有感到什么，按理说，上海是我国制药工业的基地，帮助外地责无旁贷。可是到后来却出现了这样的情况：当厂长室登记簿上前来参观的单位一个个增加的时候，供销科的进料簿上，原来供给他们原料的地区却在一天天减少。各地派人送来的不是一吨吨的猪内脏，而是大批感谢他们的锦旗和信件。原来，各地学了经验以后，回去都办起了生物制药厂，原来送给上海的原料现在都自己用起来了。
    跳出狭窄的圈子
    这件事当然引起每个人的关心。有人说：这可糟了！技术教会了别人，人家的路越走越宽，我们的路却越走越狭了。甚至有人建议领导上赶快查一下那个地方还没有生物药厂，趁早搬家，在上海是没有什么前途了。但是，有些工人的看法却不同，他们说：我们厂名叫做生物制药厂，为什么光在猪身上兜圈子呢？生物范围这么广，还怕找不到原料？这的确是个好的主意。就在2月份，全厂掀起了一个扩大新原料的运动。工人们和技术人员接连苦战了几天，终于用人的头发制成了两种治疗肝炎、肝昏迷症的药品——半胱酸和青氨酸。这一炮打响了，顿时人人信心百倍，干劲高涨。工人奚同树、张水生想起过去在皮革厂里，曾经看到他们在硝皮时，把猪皮的表面和皮里两层脏东西都刮下来丢掉，就赶到皮革厂，拿了点下脚回来一试，也可以用来生产一种叫蛋白胨的药品（金霉素的重要原料）。厂里做另一种叫胰酶的药品时没有猪胰，工人茅祖松、乐国珍就每天一清早跑到小菜场去收鸭胰、鸡胰。但是，一天只能收几斤，不够用。他们一动脑筋，上海不是有几家专门做鸡鸭肉罐头的食品厂吗，那里一定有很多，两个人就分头访问了益民、泰康、梅林几家食品厂，果然不出所料。泰康食品厂一次就给了他们五十多公斤鸭胰，用这些鸭胰做胰酶，收得率反而比猪胰高出一半。供销科的干部陆宝琦听化验人员说孕妇小便也可以做一种促进动物性机能的药品，他先到纺织厂联系，纺织厂感到收集孕妇小便有困难，收集起来也没有人送。陆宝琦一点也不灰心，回头赶到附近几个里弄请居民委员会帮忙。居民委员会的干部也觉得这是件新鲜事儿，一口应承下来。陆宝琦把粗制加工的药水给了他们，并且把加工的方法也教会了他们。目前，全市有十多个区的两百多个居民委员会正在为生物药厂收集这种取用不尽的原料，使这个厂每个月可以收到六千多公斤经过加工的粗制品。
    由于广开门路找原材料的结果，这个厂现在已经跳出了猪内脏的范围，向生物界索取到了更多的原料。他们还从羊毛、鱼白、大蒜、豆粉、黄豆芽里取出了各种药品原料。这几天他们还在研究用海藻做药品，准备向海洋进军，叫大海献宝哩！他们今年原来计划准备试制五十二种新药品，找到了这些原料以后，到6月中旬试制成功的已有三十种左右。
    就在新药品一个接一个试制成功的时候，新的问题又来了。最近这几个月，厂里常常碰到这样的事情，他们刚刚用新原料做成一种产品，今天报上一登，明天就有人上门要求交流经验，后天市场上又没有这种原料了。
    走向更广阔的大道
    这真是一个严重的考验！生物药厂的职工确实有点进退两难。不教吧，说不出口，再教吧，原料总不免要受到影响。锦旗、感谢信再多，也不能当原料呀！
    工厂领导上完全理解职工们这种心情，但是这种思想不解决，不仅会影响和外地的关系，而且还会障碍本身的提高。厂党组织先在干部中检查了各种本位思想，又发动群众讨论一个问题：自己有困难，还要不要帮助别人？绝大多数职工说：我们有困难，可不能把大门关起来，人家学去了也会生产，对国家对人民只有好处没有坏处。我们没有原料，可以再找别的；再说，我们有许多经验过去也是别人教会的。我们不能光要人家发扬协作精神，而自己却打埋伏。
    大家思路一通，再也不是埋怨叫苦，而是想尽一切办法使来实习的人学得又快又好。为了做到这一点，工厂领导上抽调了一个熟悉全厂生产的车间主任，专门负责这方面的工作。无锡一家丝厂派来了三个实习工人，来的时候说是要学习一种用蚕蛹做蛋白胨的方法，可是一到这里，却被许多药品吸引住了，想多学几种，又不好意思说。后来党支部书记沈群知道了他们的愿望，重新给他们安排了实习计划，结果三个人除学会了原来一种方法以外，又学会了细菌酶、水介蛋白等好几种药品的制造技术。许多地区派人来学习以后，办了药厂，有的还把第一批样品寄到上海来要求他们帮助化验鉴定。工人们每接到一个样品，都欣喜地说：我们国家又多了一个工厂，我们工厂又多了一个同行。
    现在，让我们看看这个厂厂长室内外的情景吧！里面挂着一块生产纪录牌，上面标明着：今年5月份和去年原料非常富裕的5月份相比，产值从二十万提高到了九十万。到6月底预计可以完成全年国家计划75％左右。他们用共产主义的精神给自己开拓了一条无限广阔的康庄大道。
