    Freshwater Fish Farming Comprehensively Developed in Shanghai Suburbs
    (Our report) Shanghai suburbs have comprehensively launched freshwater fish farming. Counties have already hatched, purchased, and caught 1.6 billion fish fry. It is estimated that the city can cultivate about 1 billion fish fingerlings (over two inches) this year, an increase of 37 times compared to last year, which creates favorable conditions for vigorously developing freshwater fish farming.
    Shanghai has very rich aquatic resources, with 900,000 mu of freshwater area suitable for fish farming, but only about 7% was stocked last year. This year, the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China has focused on the production of non-staple foods. All counties have attached great importance to fish farming in strengthening non-staple food production. Many communes have established specialized breeding and fishing teams. Currently, the entire suburban area has one specialized fishery commune and 150 specialized teams, with more than 14,000 aquaculture and fishing farmers. With the assistance of the Aquatic Products Bureau and the Aquatic Products College, the suburbs have also trained more than 1,000 aquaculture technicians.

    上海市郊全面开展淡水养鱼工作
    本报讯　上海市郊区全面展开淡水养鱼工作，各县已孵化、采购、捕捞鱼苗十六亿尾，预计今年全市可培育成鱼种（二寸以上）十亿尾左右，比去年增长三十七倍，这为大力发展淡水养鱼事业创造了有利条件。
    上海市水产资源非常丰富，可养鱼的淡水水面有九十万亩，但去年只放养了7％左右。中共上海市委今年大抓副食品生产。各县在加强副食品生产中，都很重视养鱼工作，很多公社建立了养殖和捕捞专业队，目前全郊区已有一个渔业专业公社和一百五十个专业队，养殖捕捞渔民共一万四千余人。在水产局和水产学院的帮助下，市郊还培养了一千余名养殖技术人员。
