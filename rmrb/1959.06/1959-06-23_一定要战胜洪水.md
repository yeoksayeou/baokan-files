Since entering June, the water levels of the Pearl River, Min River, and other rivers have risen sharply. Some areas in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River have also experienced water accumulation and flooding. The people of the southern provinces have already engaged in or are facing a serious and tense struggle against flooding and disaster relief. In Guangdong Province, which is experiencing the most severe water conditions, continuous rainfall in early June caused some areas to receive about one-quarter of their normal annual rainfall within a few days starting from the 11th. This coincided with the high tide, causing water levels in many areas to quickly exceed the highest levels on record. First, the Dong River basin was hit by disaster, with some county towns and most rural areas along the river submerged in floodwaters. Then, the West River and North River were in critical condition, with forecasts predicting exceptionally large floods. In Fujian, the Min River, Jiulong River, Jin River, and other rivers also experienced a rapid rise in water levels due to continuous torrential rains since early June, causing flooding in many areas. In Guangxi, the four special districts of Nanning, Liuzhou, Yulin, and Wuzhou have also been hit by torrential rains since mid-June. Currently, the floodwaters in some areas of these provinces have begun to recede, but new torrential rains have already arrived or may arrive in some areas. The party, government, military, and people of these provinces have been urgently mobilized and rushed to the front lines of flood control, disaster relief. Millions of people, under the leadership of local party and government organizations, are pooling their efforts and working day and night, braving strong winds and heavy rains, to heroically fight the floods. They have already achieved tremendous victories, preventing disasters in many places and reducing losses in the affected areas. The struggle against flood control and disaster relief is still ongoing. The people of the whole country are concerned about this struggle. Here, we extend our highest respect and sincere greetings to the heroic people on the front lines of flood control and disaster relief.

Flood control and disaster relief—this is a major issue concerning the safety of people's lives and property, striving for agricultural harvests, and ensuring the smooth progress of our country's construction endeavors. In the great struggle of our people to "wage war against nature," one aspect is to fully utilize natural resources for construction, so that they serve to improve the welfare of the people, and the other aspect is to make the greatest efforts to control the destructive forces of nature, so that they cannot endanger people's lives and national construction. Fighting against natural disasters, especially floods, is a constant task for the people of our country. The instability of agricultural harvests in our country is largely determined by the situation of natural disasters. Since liberation, especially in the past two years, many water conservancy projects have been built in various places; some existing projects have been reinforced and strengthened, and their flood resistance capacity has been greatly improved. In the Yangtze River Basin, the Yellow River Basin, and the Songhua River Basin, extraordinarily large floods have been overcome in the past few years. Cadres and the masses have accumulated rich experience in fighting floods. The establishment of the people's communes has created unprecedentedly favorable conditions for mutual cooperation, strengthening flood control forces, and eliminating contradictions between upstream and downstream, and between left and right banks. However, our strength in fighting floods is still limited; the intensity and magnitude of possible floods cannot be accurately predicted. The heavy rains and floods that Guangdong encountered this year, for example, were something that no one had expected beforehand. Although the local party, government, military, and people fought together and made use of the existing favorable conditions for flood control, many areas still could not avoid being invaded by floodwaters. Although this is an unavoidable event under the current conditions, it cannot but arouse everyone's vigilance. According to weather forecasts, the flood season may come earlier this year in various places, and the water volume may also be relatively large; close attention must be paid to this situation. Some old projects are old, many new projects have not been tested, and the collapse of small and medium-sized reservoirs has occurred repeatedly in many places. The more water conservancy projects are built, the more attention should be paid to inspection and maintenance; it must not be assumed that the more water conservancy projects there are, the less attention should be paid to flood control. This year's flood control work must ensure that more newly built factories and transportation arteries are not invaded by floods, and that more areas of agricultural harvests are not taken away by floods. The task is more important than in previous years. We must think of the worst and strive for the best. We must have great determination, full confidence, and meticulous work. With the strong leadership of the Party, the people's high morale, rich experience over the years, and full preparation in terms of organization, materials, and ideology, we will certainly achieve greater victories in this year's flood control and disaster relief struggle.

In areas that have already suffered from flood disasters, flood relief and disaster relief are the overriding central tasks. The first important thing is to save people. All available tools must be used to remove people trapped by floods from danger and properly solve their food and shelter problems. Once the water recedes, there must be no slackening, and follow-up work must be closely followed. On the one hand, the affected people must be resettled, relieved, and medically treated as soon as possible and properly; on the other hand, the masses must be actively led and helped to resume production and rebuild their homes. The first priority is to rescue submerged crops. Various methods and tools should be used to drain water, wash seedlings, support seedlings, replant seedlings, and apply fertilizer so that seedlings can quickly regain their vitality. If late rice seedling fields are destroyed, they must be replanted quickly to ensure the completion of the original late rice planting plan. Damaged water conservancy projects must also be repaired immediately to prevent floods from making a comeback. In areas that are still seriously threatened by torrential rains and floods, the first important thing is to carry out emergency repairs. On the one hand, dikes and embankments must be heightened and strengthened; on the other hand, the transfer of residents, factories, warehouses, etc. must be carried out. Crops that are already ripening or are about to ripen must be harvested in a timely manner. Now, in Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, and other provinces and regions, from the provincial and regional level to the commune level, many party committee secretaries, regardless of wind and rain, day and night, personally patrol and command the front lines of flood control and disaster relief, move sand and transport stones with the masses, or go deep into disaster areas, share weal and woe with the masses, and engage in self-reliance through production, demonstrating the excellent qualities of the people's cadres. This is extremely important for overcoming floods and overcoming disasters.

The flood situation in the south has issued a battle warning to flood control work throughout the country. While Guangdong and other places are fighting floods, other places should also "race against floods." Whether we can more confidently overcome floods depends on whether all preparations can be made before the floods arrive. The most important thing is these few things:

1.  Quickly and carefully inspect all water conservancy projects and dikes; those that have already been inspected must be re-inspected once, or even several times. If there are problems, fix them quickly. If there are no problems, take precautions. On the one hand, check the flood control capacity of the projects themselves; on the other hand, check the local historical and current hydrological records. The estimates of project effectiveness and the estimates of possible flood situations must leave room for maneuver. The effectiveness should not be overestimated, but rather underestimated; the flood situation should not be underestimated, but rather overestimated. In particular, close attention should be paid to untested new projects and old projects that have been around for many years. Reservoirs should also leave room for water storage, and should not be too full; reservoirs with poor quality should store less water or even no water before the flood season. Some reservoirs have overflow channels that are too small or have no overflow channels; this must be remedied quickly. All preparations must be made for the defense and heightening of dikes to ensure that "the water rises and the dike rises," "the flood rises one inch, and the dike rises one inch." Those who have dammed rivers for spring irrigation should quickly open them; those who have opened mouths in the dikes should quickly block them.

2.  For water conservancy projects under construction, decide decisively based on manpower, material resources, time, and the importance of the project itself. We should not only think from the beneficial aspects, but also consider the worst climate and the possibility of the flood season arriving early. Do not force things and do not take chances. The party and government leaders on the construction site should fully listen to the opinions of the masses and seriously consider different opinions. When dealing with technical issues, we must adopt a scientific attitude and correct working methods, and not handle them with simple administrative orders. Those that can control floods and store water before the flood season must concentrate their efforts on rushing to repair; ensure quality, ensure progress, only allow repair, and do not allow damage. Do not blindly pursue progress, regardless of quality standards. All those who have been found to be of poor quality must be dealt with seriously. Those that need to be reinforced must be resolutely reinforced, and those that need to be reworked must be resolutely reworked. Those that cannot be intercepted and controlled before the flood season must not be risked, but must quickly do the necessary protection work, and then resolutely stop work. For such projects, the earlier the work is stopped, the more proactive we can be, and we must decide decisively. Of course, it will also cause problems if we rashly close the team without doing a good job of protection.

3.  Formulate detailed flood control plans and emergency measures. We must defend on all fronts and ensure key points. We must strive for victory on all fronts, and ensure the safety of densely populated areas, important industrial and mining areas, high-yield grain areas, and transportation arteries. We must design a variety of plans according to various possible situations, so that we have appropriate countermeasures and thorough preparations in any situation, and can deal with them calmly and calmly. After the plans and measures are determined, materials and equipment should be allocated according to the plans and measures. When using flood control materials, we must maximize the strength of each item, and first use it in dangerous sections, and not be too dispersed.

4.  Do a good job of flood control organization. Ensure that each reservoir and each section of the dike has a dedicated person responsible for management, inspection, and maintenance, day and night, rain or shine. The storage and transportation of flood control materials and equipment must also be assigned to personnel to ensure that they are available whenever needed. At the same time, emergency rescue teams should be organized as soon as possible to undertake the most urgent and important tasks. Production teams, communes, and counties should arrange for large-scale cooperation in flood control and disaster relief as soon as possible, so as to organize mutual support when necessary. In short, we must have a backbone force, and we must be able to mobilize the whole people; we must have a clear division of labor, each with its own responsibilities, and we must have unified leadership, unified dispatch, strengthen contact, and coordinate actions. Areas without danger should support areas in danger; non-disaster areas should support disaster areas; non-key flood control areas should support key flood control areas. Under the strong leadership of the Party, the entire people form a strong whole, which is the most important guarantee for the victory of flood control.

    一定要战胜洪水
    进入6月份以来，珠江、闽江等河流水位陡涨，长江中游也有一些地区积水成涝。南方各省人民已经投入了或正在面临着一场严重的紧张的防汛抗洪斗争。水情最急的广东省，6月上旬连续降雨，11日起许多地区几天的雨量就达到正常情况下全年雨量的四分之一左右，又恰逢海水大潮倒顶，不少地区的水位很快就超过了历史上有记载的最高水位。先是东江流域成灾，沿江一些县城和大部分农村浸入洪水；接着西江、北江告急，预计可能出现特大洪水。在福建，闽江、九龙江、晋江等河流也因6月上旬以来连日暴雨，水位急剧上涨，不少地区发生洪涝灾害。广西的南宁、柳州、玉林、梧州四个专区也自中旬起暴雨成灾。目前这些省的部分地区洪水开始消退，但新的暴雨在一些地区已经来临或者可能来临。这些省党政军民已经紧急动员起来，奔赴防汛抗洪救灾的前线。几百万人在当地党政的领导下，群策群力，日日夜夜，冒着狂风骤雨，同洪水英勇搏斗，已经取得了巨大的胜利，使许多地方免于出险，使受灾地区损失减轻。防汛抗洪的斗争还在继续进行。全国人民都关心着这场斗争。我们在这里向防汛抗洪前线的英雄人民致以崇高的敬意和亲切的慰问。
    防汛抗洪——这是关系着维护人民生命财产的安全、争取农业的丰收、保证我国各项建设事业顺利进行的重大问题。在我国人民“向自然界开仗”的伟大斗争中，一方面是要充分利用自然资源进行建设，使之为增进人民的福利服务，另一方面是尽最大努力控制自然的破坏力，使之不能危害人民的生活和国家的建设。同自然灾害、特别是同洪水作斗争，是我国人民经常的任务。我国农业收成的不能稳定，在很大程度上决定于自然灾害的情况。解放以来，特别是近两年来，各地修建了许多水利工程；旧有的一些工程经过培修加固，抗洪能力也大大提高。在长江流域、黄河流域、松花江流域，前几年都战胜了特大的洪水。干部和群众已经有了同洪水作斗争的丰富经验。人民公社的成立，为互相配合协作、加强防洪力量和消除上下游、左右岸之间的矛盾，创造了空前有利的条件。但是，目前我们同洪水作斗争的力量毕竟还是有限的；对于可能发生的洪水的猛烈和巨大的程度，仍然无法精确预计。像广东今年遇到的这样大的暴雨和洪水，就是事先谁也没有料到的。当地党政军民一致奋战，运用已有的防洪的有利条件，虽然使许多地区转危为安，但不少地区仍然未能免于遭受洪水侵袭。这虽然是在目前的条件下难免发生的事情，但也不能不引起大家的警惕。根据天气预报，今年各地的汛期可能来得早，水量也可能比较大；对于这个情况，更不可不严密注意。有些旧工程年代已久，许多新工程未经考验，不少新工程尚未完工；中小型水库倒坝的情况在不少地方已经屡有出现。水利工程修得多了，就更要多多注意检查、维护；决不可认为水利工程多了就可以不注意防汛了。今年的防汛工作，要确保更多新建的工厂和交通要道不受洪水侵袭，要保卫更多地区的农业大丰收不被洪水夺去，任务比往年更加重大了。要从最坏处着想，向最好处努力。决心要大，信心要足，工作要细。有党的坚强的领导，有群众的昂扬的斗志，有历年的丰富的经验，加上组织上、物资上、思想上的充分准备，我们一定能在今年的防汛抗洪斗争中取得更大的胜利。
    在已经遭受洪水灾害的地区，抗洪救灾是压倒一切的中心任务。第一件要紧事是救人。必须运用一切能够运用的工具，使被洪水围困的人们脱离险境，妥善地解决他们的食宿问题。水退了，也一点不可松懈，要使各项善后工作紧紧跟上。一方面要尽快地妥善地安置、救济、医疗受灾的人民群众，一方面要积极地领导和帮助群众恢复生产，重建家园。首先是抢救被淹的农作物，采取各种方法，运用各种工具，排出积水，洗苗，扶苗，补苗，追肥，使禾苗迅速恢复生机。晚稻秧田被冲坏了，要赶快补播，保证完成原定的晚稻种植计划。冲毁的水利工程，也要立即抢修，防御洪水卷土重来。在仍然受着暴雨和洪水严重威胁的地区，第一件要紧事是抢险。一方面要加高加固堤防，一方面要做好居民、工厂、仓库等的转移工作。作物已经黄熟或即将黄熟的，要抓紧时机抢收。现在，广东、广西、福建等省区，从省区到公社，许多党委书记不避风雨，不分昼夜，亲临防汛抗洪前线巡逻、指挥，同群众一起搬沙、运石，或者深入灾区，同群众同甘共苦，生产自救，表现了人民干部的优良品质。这对于战胜洪水、战胜灾害是极关重要的。
    南方的汛情给全国各地的防汛工作发出了战斗的警号。在广东等地正在同洪水搏斗的时候，在其它许多地方也应该“同洪水赛跑”。能不能更有把握地战胜洪水，就看各项准备工作能不能在洪水到来之前通统做好。最重要的是这几件事：
    一、赶快把所有水利工程和堤防仔细检查一遍；已经检查过的也要复查一次，甚至好几次。有毛病，就赶快治。没毛病，也要防护。一方面要检查工程本身的拦洪能力，一方面要查考当地历年和当前的水文纪录。对于工程效能的估计和可能发生的汛情的估计，一定要留有余地。对效能不可估计过高，宁可偏低；对汛情不可估计过低，宁可偏高。特别是对于未经考验的新工程和年代已久的旧工程，更要密切注意。水库蓄水也要留有余地，不要太满；质量较差的，汛前更要少蓄水，甚至不蓄水。有些水库留的溢洪道过小或者没有留，要赶快补救。对堤防要作好防守和加高的一切准备，保证做到“水涨堤高”，“洪水涨一寸，堤围高一寸”。春灌的时候拦河打了坝的，要快些扒开；堤上开了口的，要快些堵好。
    二、正在施工的水利工程，要根据人力、物力、时间和工程本身的重要程度，当机立断，决定取舍。不可只从有利的方面着想，而要考虑到最坏的气候，考虑到汛期可能提前到来。千万不可勉强从事，千万不可心存侥幸。工地上的党政领导同志要充分听取群众意见，认真考虑不同的意见。对待技术问题，一定要采取科学的态度和正确的工作方法，不可用简单的行政命令的方式处理。能够在汛前拦洪蓄水的，要集中力量抢修；保证质量，保证进度，只许修好，不许修坏。切不可片面追求进度，不顾质量标准。凡已经发现质量不好的，都要严肃处理。需要加固的坚决加固，需要返工的坚决返工。凡是没有条件在汛前截流拦洪的，决不可冒险从事，而要赶快做好必要的防护工作，然后坚决停工。这样的工程，停工越早，越能主动，必须当机立断。当然，不做好防护工作就草率收兵，也是会出乱子的。
    三、详密制定防汛计划和抢险措施。既要全面防守，也要确保重点。要力争全线胜利，对人口集中地区、重要工矿地区、粮食高产地区、交通要道，更要确保平安。要按照可能遭遇的各种不同情况，设计多种方案，做到在任何情况下都有适当的对策，都有周到的准备，都能不慌不乱，沉着应战。计划措施确定之后，就要按照计划措施，配备物资器材。在运用防汛物资的时候，要使每一件东西发挥最大的力量，首先要用于险要地段，不可过于分散。
    四、做好防汛组织工作。做到每座水库、每段堤围，白天黑夜、雨天晴天，都有专人负责管理、巡查、养护。防汛物资器材的保管、运输，也都要确定人员负责，做到随要随到。同时，要及早组织抢险突击队，担当最紧急最重要的任务。各生产队、各公社、各县之间，应当及早安排防汛抗洪的大协作，以便在必要时组织相互支援。总之，既要有基干力量，又要能全民动员；既要明确分工，各有专责，又要统一领导，统一调度，加强联系，协同动作。没有危险的地区要支援遭到危险的地区；非灾区要支援灾区；非重点防汛地区要支援重点防汛地区，在党的坚强领导下，全体人民结成一个坚强的整体，这是防汛胜利的最重要的保证。
