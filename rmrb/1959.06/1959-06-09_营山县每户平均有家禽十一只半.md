This newspaper Chengdu, 8th—Sichuan has emerged as a model county for poultry production: Yingshan County. By the end of April, the county's total number of chickens and ducks was more than 1,420,000, an average of eleven and a half per household, an increase of 103% compared to before the establishment of the communes.

The large-scale development of poultry has greatly benefited the state, the communes, and individual farmers. In the past year, the county produced approximately 5 million catties of chicken and duck eggs, which supplied the nearby urban and rural people for consumption, and also exported nearly 20,000 catties of duck down and feathers. The total annual output value of chicken and duck eggs accounted for about 45% of the total agricultural output value, with each farming household earning an average of 23.4 yuan from the sale of chicken and duck eggs.

The Sichuan Provincial Department of Agriculture recently held an on-site chicken and duck raising meeting in Yingshan County, summarizing the county's experience: 1. Launch a nationwide chicken and duck raising campaign. The county party secretary personally leads this work, establishing specialized agencies at all levels; holding on-site meetings and debates among the masses to make everyone aware of the benefits of developing chickens and ducks, dispel various ideological concerns at the meetings, and specifically help solve difficulties. 2. Make every effort to solve the feed problem. Yingshan County's solution to the feed problem is for the communes to allocate a certain amount of broken rice, feed grains, and rice bran to the members; mobilize members to plant more feed on vacant lots and slopes around their houses; widely collect wild feed; process and cultivate insects (using compost, sod, or cow dung, rice bran and sewage, a large number of insects can be fermented within ten days); and drive poultry to empty fields and open spaces for grazing. 3. Vigorously promote incubation to solve the problem of poultry sources. Last winter and this spring, the county launched a mass poultry incubation campaign, hatching more than 800,000 chicks and ducklings. It also called on the masses to temporarily kill fewer chickens and eat fewer chicken and duck eggs, which prepared the ground ideologically and materially for the incubation campaign. 4. Strengthen management and adopt various methods to prevent damage to crops and the occurrence of diseases.

    营山县每户平均有家禽十一只半
    本报成都8日电　四川出现一个家禽生产模范县——营山县。这个县到4月底止，鸡鸭总数是一百四十二万多只，平均每户十一只半，比公社建立前增加了103％。
    由于家禽大发展，使国家、公社和农民个人都得到了很大好处。在去年一年内，全县约产鸡鸭蛋五百多万斤，供应了附近城乡人民食用，还输出了近二万斤鸭绒鸭毛。全年鸡鸭蛋总产值占农业总产值的45％左右，每一农户出售鸡鸭蛋收入平均达二十三元四角。
    四川省农业厅最近在营山县召开了养鸡养鸭现场会，总结了这个县的经验：一、开展全民养鸡鸭运动。县委书记亲自领导这项工作，层层建立专门机构；在群众中召开现场会、辩论会，使大家认识到发展鸡鸭的好处，并在会上解除各种思想顾虑，具体帮助解决困难。二、千方百计解决饲料问题。营山县解决饲料的办法是由公社分配给社员一定数量的碎米、脚粮、谷糠等；发动社员利用屋前屋后荒坡隙地增种饲料；广泛采集野生饲料；加工培制昆虫（用堆肥、草皮或牛粪、谷糠加污水，十天内可沤出大批虫子）；把家禽赶到空田、空地放牧。三、大搞孵化，解决禽源问题。去冬今春，全县开展了群众性的家禽孵化运动，孵出小鸡小鸭八十余万只。并号召群众暂时少杀鸡，少吃鸡鸭蛋，给孵化运动作好了思想和物质准备。四、加强管理，采用各种方法防止糟踏庄稼和病疫发生。
