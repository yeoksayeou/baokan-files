Short Commentary

    Implement to Every Person
    Implement to Every Field
    Today's report in this newspaper about the zoning and grading of land and the implementation of increased production measures in Chaling County, Hunan, and the news about the establishment of high-yield "pace-setter" fields layer by layer in Fengxi Commune, Chao'an County, Guangdong, report on the leadership methods for carrying out the large-scale movement for achieving yields of 1,000 jin per mu. The experiences of these two places coincide and complement each other, embodying the spirit of combining soaring enthusiasm with scientific analysis.
    Their soaring enthusiasm is not suspended in mid-air, but is generated on the basis of a good summary of the experience of local high-yield fields in previous years, especially last year. This foundation is solid and reliable because it comes from the rich practice of the local masses. Fengxi Commune "dissected" 139 mu of high-yield paddy fields, proving that land with various conditions in the commune had produced 1,000 jin of rice last year. The combination of cadres, the masses, and technicians to summarize the experience of these high-yield fields has instilled courage and determination in people to strive for a large-scale yield of 1,000 jin per mu this year.
    Can a yield of 1,000 jin per mu on a small plot of land serve as a basis for launching a movement for a yield of 1,000 jin per mu on a large area of land? The truth of Marxism is that everything depends on time, place, and conditions. Even with the advanced experience of local and external high-yield fields, specific analysis is still necessary to promote it universally on a large scale. The comrades in Chaling County and Chao'an County are paying close attention to this point. They analyzed different natural conditions and adopted different measures according to local conditions. For example, Fengxi Commune analyzed that soil with higher nitrogen content requires less nitrogen fertilizer and more plant ash and green manure; for rice varieties with strong tillering ability, the transplanting spacing should be sparser, and stronger false seedlings should be used... and so on. This is where the importance of zoning and grading all high-yield fields lies.
    Zoning and grading means lining up the fields and conducting specific analysis. The process of specific analysis is also the process of following the mass line. In order to do a good job of specific analysis, they widely absorbed experienced farmers and technicians to participate together—because they know the details of each plot of land best. They know the soil quality of this field, the past fertilization situation, the water conservancy conditions, the sunlight and wind direction, and the characteristics of that field like the back of their hand. On the basis of understanding the details of each field, high-yield fields are established layer by layer as "pace-setters" (which are often some of the high-yield fields used to summarize experience last year) to compare with land of the same conditions using advanced examples. This is also a process of self-education and ideological emancipation for the masses. The same piece of barren land had one plot that yielded 1,025 jin per mu last year because of proper measures; the conditions of the remaining fields are similar, even much better than it; and it is not impossible to take corresponding measures. Why can't the yield be more than 1,000 jin per mu this year? In contrast, ideas suddenly become clear, and ambition arises spontaneously. Further mobilize the masses to study: What measures did the high-yield fields that reached 1,000 jin last year adopt? What measures need to be taken this year to catch up with the high-yield "pace-setters"? In this way, the model of high yield drives the large-scale movement of 1,000 jin. The idea of ​​1,000 jin is implemented to every person, and different measures are implemented to every field.
    After the direction is determined, there must also be a detailed organizational guarantee. Professional teams are assigned to contract work, and cadres go to the teams in separate groups, contracting output, contracting measures, contracting technology, and reaching the grassroots level. This not only ensures that the indicators and measures are implemented, but also allows them to take root. Due to the influence of natural and other conditions, the various small plots within a large area inevitably vary. In order to ensure the comprehensive high yield of a large area of land, the most powerful cadres must be dispatched to the weakest areas. The comrades in Chaling and other places have also done a better job in this regard.
    If the leadership work in any region can be deepened layer by layer, implemented step by step, and rooted in the fields, then there will be great hope for achieving high yields on a large area of land.

### 落实到每一个人  落实到每一块田

    落实到每一个人
    落实到每一块田
    今天本报发表的湖南茶陵县划片分等、增产措施落实到片的消息，和广东潮安县枫溪公社层层片片设立高产
  “标兵”田的消息，报道了开展大面积千斤丰产运动的领导方法。这两个地方的经验不谋而合，而又互相补充，都体现了冲天干劲和科学分析相结合的精神。
    他们的冲天的干劲不是悬在半空中的，而是在很好地总结当地历年的特别是去年的高产田的经验的基础上产生出来的。这样的基础是稳固可靠的。因为它来自当地群众的丰富的实践。枫溪公社“解剖”了一百三十九亩高产稻田，证明这个公社的各种条件的土地去年都出现过千斤水稻。干部、群众和技术员互相结合，总结了这些高产田的经验，就使人们树立了夺取今年水稻大面积千斤的勇气和决心。
    小片土地出现过每亩千斤的产量，能不能作为在大面积土地上开展亩产千斤运动的根据呢？马克思主义的真理是：一切决定于时间、地点和条件。即使有了本地和外来的高产田的先进经验，要在大面积上普遍推行，还须进行具体的分析。茶陵县和潮安县的同志们对这一点是密切注意的。他们分析了不同的自然条件，因地制宜采取了不同的措施。例如，枫溪公社分析含氮较多的土质，必须少施氮肥，多施草木灰和绿肥；分蘖力强的稻禾品种，插秧规格就要比较稀一些，并且要采用更加强壮的假植秧……如此等等。他们把所有的高额丰产田分片划等的重要意义就在这里。
    分片划等，就是把田禾排队，进行具体分析。具体分析的过程，也是走群众路线的过程。为了把具体分析做得好，他们广泛地吸收有经验的农民和技术员等一起参加——因为他们最了解各片土地的底细。这块田的土质如何，过去的施肥情况如何，水利条件如何，阳光和风向如何，那块田又有什么特点，他们大多了如指掌。在摸清各片田地底细的基础上，层层片片，树立高产田的
  “标兵”（这往往也就是用以总结经验的去年的一些高产田），用先进的榜样来和同等条件的土地进行对比。这又是群众进行自我教育、解放思想的过程。同是一片瘦板田，去年其中有一块因为措施得当，已经亩产一千零二十五斤；其余的田条件差不多，甚至比它好得多；采取相应的措施也并不是做不到的事，为什么今年就不能亩产千斤以上呢？对比之下，思路豁然开朗，雄心勃然而起。再进一步发动群众研究：去年达到千斤的高产田究竟采用了哪些措施？今年要向高产“标兵”看齐，需要采取哪些措施？这样，高产的典型就带动了大面积的千斤运动。千斤的思想落实到了每一个人，不同的措施也落实到每一块田。
    方向确定以后，还须有细致的组织保证。专业组分工包干，干部分头深入到组，包产量，包措施，包技术，一竿子插到底。这就不但使指标、措施落实，而且使它们生根。大面积之中的各个小块，由于自然和其他条件的影响，难免参差不齐。为了确保大面积土地全面丰产，就必须对最薄弱的地方加派最有力的干部。茶陵等地的同志在这一方面的做法也是比较好的。
    任何一个地区，如果领导工作都能这样层层深入，步步落实，一竿子扎到田间，在大面积土地上夺取高产就一定大有希望。
