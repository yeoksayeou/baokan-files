Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, June 10th:  Various regions of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region are seizing the season to develop early and robust sweet potato seedlings. Currently, over 622,000 mu of sweet potato vines in the region have been pulled and closed, and they are growing very well. Areas that started cultivating seedlings earlier have already begun preparing the land and transplanting the seedlings.

    50% to 60% of the sweet potato seedlings cultivated in various regions have undergone one to two rounds of inter-tillage, weeding, and topdressing. In the care of sweet potato seedlings, all regions have universally implemented the "three guarantees and five fixings" responsibility system, which includes guaranteeing tasks, work points, and fertilizer; assigning dedicated leaders and caregivers; specifying quality standards; implementing inspection and acceptance procedures; and establishing reward systems. This ensures that every plot of sweet potato seedlings is managed and grows sturdily.

    The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region plans to plant over 8 million mu of sweet potatoes this summer. Party committees at all levels are adopting the method of consulting with the masses and summarizing last year's experiences, striving for early planting, extensive planting, and high-quality planting. The Nanning Special District has cultivated 151,000 mu of sweet potato seedlings, which is sufficient to meet the planting needs of 1.4 million mu of sweet potato land in the entire special district. While managing early rice fields, various regions of the Baise Special District are appropriately arranging labor to vigorously promote sweet potato seedling cultivation. According to statistics, the region has cultivated over 94,000 mu of sweet potato seedlings, nearly double the amount compared to the same period last year. Many communes in Liuzhou, Guilin, Yulin, and other regions have also summarized their experiences in increasing production last year and are promoting sweet potato block seedling cultivation.

    广西早育薯苗
    据新华社南宁10日电  广西僮族自治区各地正抓紧季节早育和育壮红薯苗。目前全区六十二万二千多亩薯秧已拔蔓封行，生长很好，育苗较早的地区已开始整地插苗。
    各地已育的薯苗有50％到60％经过一次到两次中耕除草和追肥工作。在护理薯苗中，各地普遍贯彻包任务、包工分、包肥料，定专人领导、专人护理、规格质量、检查验收、奖励制度等三包五定责任制，做到块块薯苗有人管，兜兜生长粗壮。
    广西僮族自治区今年计划夏种红薯八百多万亩。各地党委采取和群众商量，总结去年经验的办法，力求早种、多种、种好。南宁专区共培育薯苗十五万一千多亩，足够全专区种植一百四十万亩红薯地的需要。百色专区各地在早稻田间管理的同时，适当安排劳动力，大抓红薯育苗工作，据统计，全区已育红薯苗九万四千多亩，比去年同期增加将近一倍。柳州、桂林、玉林等地区许多公社还总结了去年增产经验，推行薯块育苗。
