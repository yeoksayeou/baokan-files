    The pleasant summer vacation for Soviet primary and secondary school students has already begun. Now, in many beautiful scenic areas of the Soviet Union, the bonfires of children's summer camps have been lit, and everywhere is filled with the joyful songs of the Young Pioneers.

    This year, more than three million primary and secondary school students in the Soviet Union will spend their summer vacations in summer camps set up in various scenic areas. Labor will be one of the main contents of the children's holiday life. In the summer camps, the children will cultivate trees and feed small animals. In addition, various technical groups will be organized to learn production skills. Many summer camps also organize children to directly participate in labor in factories and collective farms, or organize them to participate in sideline production and learn patching and sewing techniques.

    This summer vacation, sports activities in summer camps throughout the Soviet Union are also very rich and colorful. Soviet sports organizations, together with educational institutions, have organized many interesting educational activities for the children. The Moscow City Sports Association specifically passed a resolution to organize football, volleyball, cycling and other competitions for children, and various game competitions for younger children. All major stadiums in Moscow will also be fully open to children, and various competitions will be organized for them. Many summer camps also specially invite students from sports schools to participate in summer camps to teach children swimming, gymnastics and other sports skills.

    Young travel enthusiasts will visit and travel around the country during the summer vacation. Many schools have organized students to visit the construction sites of the Seven-Year Plan in various places this year. This year, middle school students in the Irkutsk Oblast have also organized forty geological exploration teams, and they will work with adults to explore the underground wealth of Siberia. This summer, the Russian Federal Republic will also hold a republic-wide conference of young travelers, and one thousand two hundred outstanding young travel enthusiasts will participate in this conference, where they will exchange exploration experiences and meet with famous figures.

    苏联儿童的夏令营生活
    到工厂农庄去劳动　开展各种体育活动
    去各地观光和旅行　参加勘探资源工作
    苏联中小学学生愉快的暑假生活已经开始了。现在，苏联许多优美的风景区已经燃起了儿童夏令营的篝火，到处都充满了少年先锋队队员们欢乐的歌声。
    今年，苏联将有三百多万名中小学学生到设立在各风景区的夏令营去消度暑假。劳动将是儿童们假期生活的主要内容之一。在夏令营内，儿童们将培植树木，喂养小动物，此外还将组织各种技术小组，学习生产技能。许多夏令营还组织孩子们直接到工厂和集体农庄去参加劳动，或者组织他们参加副业生产、学习织补和缝纫技术。
    今年暑假期间，苏联各地夏令营里的体育活动也非常丰富多采。苏联体育组织同教育机关一起为孩子们组织了许多有趣的教育活动。莫斯科市体育协会专门通过一项决议，决定为儿童们组织足球、排球、自行车等比赛，为小儿童组织各种游戏比赛。莫斯科各大运动场也将全部为儿童开放，并为他们组织各种比赛。许多夏令营还专门请体育学校的学生参加夏令营，教孩子游泳、体操等各种体育技巧。
    少年旅行爱好者在暑假期间将到全国各地观光旅行。许多学校今年都组织学生们去各地参观七年计划建设工地。伊尔库次克州的中学生们今年还组织了四十个地质考察队，他们将同成年人一起去勘探西伯利亚的地下财富。今年夏天，俄罗斯联邦共和国还将举行全共和国少年旅行家大会，一千二百个优秀的少年旅行爱好者将参加这个大会，在那里他们将交流勘探经验并跟著名人物会见。　（新华社）（附图片）
