    The Problem of Automation and Mechanization in Soviet Industry
    Professor Kuznetzov, Soviet Union
    The comprehensive mechanization and automation of production processes is one of the main directions of scientific and technological progress in the Soviet Union. Currently, Soviet scientists, engineers, and those practically engaged in socialist production are working on solving the problems of mechanization and automation.

    Comprehensive mechanization and automation of production processes are fundamental scientific methods for improving social labor productivity in terms of both quantity and quality, and for reducing equipment downtime and increasing equipment utilization. In the Soviet Union, the vigorous development of science and technology has laid the foundation for progress in this area.

    It should be pointed out that comprehensive mechanization is not simply replacing manual labor with machines, but automating all processes at a fairly high technical level, that is, adopting a whole set of machines that cooperate with each other.

    The Soviet Union's plan for developing the national economy from 1959 to 1965 stipulates that heavy manual labor in all sectors of the national economy should be completely eliminated on the basis of comprehensive mechanization of production processes. The transition will be made from the automation of certain units and machine devices to complete automation, and even the establishment of fully automated workshops and even enterprises.

    The achievements of computer technology have opened up broad prospects for the automation of production processes. The use of modern computers can automatically select and carry out technological processes according to the most favorable conditions. With the development of computer technology, complex production projects, conveying devices, workshops, and entire factories can be gradually fully automated. This task is easiest to achieve in enterprises with uninterrupted production processes.

    In addition to completing the overall automation plan (which stipulates the establishment of at least 1,300 large-scale automated production lines), preparations are being made to establish more than 50 experimental enterprises in various industrial sectors to implement the latest plans for comprehensive automation. These types of enterprises will be examples of new types of production in the stage of comprehensively building communism. The establishment of exemplary enterprises for fully automated production is to gain experience in fully automation.

    In the Soviet Union, the development of comprehensive mechanization and automation of production processes is of national significance. The current level of science and technology in the Soviet Union has created conditions for the widespread implementation of comprehensive mechanization and automation in industry, and it is possible to establish a series of new, fully automated enterprises that carry out production in various different sectors.

    The thousands of small automated production lines established by machine manufacturing enterprises for their own needs are currently running smoothly. It is planned to use the power of enterprises to establish another 1,500 to 2,000 automated production lines. In the tractor and agricultural machinery manufacturing plants alone, 200 automated production lines will be established to produce large quantities of the most labor-intensive products.

    Machine manufacturing enterprises have already expanded the production of high-efficiency machines and equipment. They have adopted automated, semi-automated, and mechanized assembly lines, designed and produced exemplary new machines, equipment, and instruments for various sectors of the national economy, and have also taken measures to further specialize and cooperate in production.

    As everyone knows, the speed and technical level of the entire national economic development of the Soviet Union mainly depend on the degree to which the needs for machines, machinery, and other equipment are met, and on the degree of perfection of these machines and equipment.

    It is unimaginable to have modern atomic equipment, electronic computers, launch artificial earth satellites, manufacture powerful intercontinental ballistic rockets, and master other advanced technologies without various automated equipment, machines, and instruments.

    The development of automation and mechanization has to go through several stages: automation of individual machines and units (such as automated and semi-automated machine tools), automation of a system of machine operations (such as automated machine tool assembly lines, automated sections, workshops), and finally complete automation, that is, the establishment of automated factories.

    In the case of complete automation, all basic and auxiliary processes, including from one production cycle to another, are unattended. Workers are only responsible for adjusting the production process, paying attention to the operation of the machines, and preventing stoppages and accidents.

    At present, the Soviet Union has produced a large number of various automated machines. A universal lathe controlled by special instruments has been produced. This lathe is used to turn complex parts of various shapes. The machine tool is adjusted according to the dimensions of the parts to be cut on a special disk with scale numbers. The length of the part is adjusted on one disk; the diameter of the part is adjusted on another disk. Then, the worker presses a button and the machine starts: the tool automatically approaches the spare part, cuts and turns in depth and laterally according to the required dimensions, and then continues to turn shavings according to the specified diameter without stopping. After the part is made, the tool automatically returns to its original state. The turner removes the part, puts on a new spare part, and then starts the lathe again.

    This automated machine tool does not produce rejects, and the parts it manufactures consistently maintain an accuracy of 3% mm. Its adjuster only takes one and a half to two minutes to move parts. The turner does not need to stay in front of the machine; he can watch several such automated machine tools at the same time.

    However, the adoption of a batch of individual, even very perfect, automatic machines in production has not been able to completely solve all the tasks of automation, whether in the past or now. This is because a series of auxiliary processes (feeding, loading, positioning the center, controlling dimensions, taking and unloading and transporting finished parts, cleaning shavings, etc.) have not yet been automated. As a result, the effect of using automated machines to speed up the production process is often offset by the losses of auxiliary processes.

    The establishment of automated machine tool assembly lines has solved this task. Moreover, in many cases, these assembly lines are built on the basis of existing equipment. In many advanced enterprises in the Soviet Union, combined machine tool automated assembly lines have been established.

    Practice has proved that automated assembly lines can not only greatly improve labor productivity and reduce the labor of workers, but also reduce the area occupied by equipment, shorten the time of the production cycle and the so-called auxiliary production time used for loading, positioning, and fixing the center. These assembly lines also help to maintain a strict production rhythm, speed up machine revolutions, and reduce product costs.

    In the Soviet automobile factories, you can see automated machine tool assembly lines for making springs. Here, an automatic machine for filling materials fills steel plates into a steel plate cutting machine and cuts them into the required dimensions. Every three seconds, a batch of cut steel plates is sent by the machine to a conveyor belt. This conveyor belt does not rotate continuously, but intermittently. The position of the steel plates is moved by a machine device with a "walking rack", which moves the parts of the future spring from one automatic machine to another.

    In order to make all the machines start, the automated assembly line is also equipped with a hydraulic device. The cut steel plates also have to go through thirty-two processes: drilling holes, heating, pressing convex surfaces, hardening, strengthening coefficients, testing hardness, etc. Every forty-eight seconds, a batch of finished springs is automatically unloaded from the conveyor belt.

    This automated assembly line can produce more than two million springs a year. The number of workers working on this automated assembly line is only one-seventeenth of the number of workers in a mechanized spring workshop.

    Comprehensive mechanization and automation of production processes also include such work as assembling parts and finished products, which in the past used manual labor. In the Soviet Union, there are automated assembly lines for manufacturing and assembling automobile wheels. All the processes that used to be done by people are not only mechanized, but also automated. The machine welds the wheel rims, smooths the burrs, and chisels the opening of the valve. The steel billet passes through a set of conveyors and is transferred from one process to another, and every thirty or forty seconds, a finished wheel is hoisted on the hook of the main conveyor belt. You should know that the wheel mentioned here weighs twenty-eight kilograms. In the past, workers had to move a ton of steel in one shift. Now dozens of workers have been freed from heavy physical labor. The entire automated assembly line only needs three adjusters, one inspector, and one auxiliary worker.

    In the Soviet Union, there is also an automated workshop for producing tractor piston cranks. In this workshop, all processes from cutting to packaging finished products are mechanized. The adjuster carefully observes the production process in front of the console. Once a problem occurs in the production process, the signal light here will light up. Automatic inspection instruments do not allow an error of three millionths of a meter. Every hour, sixty cardboard boxes are sent out from the automated workshop, each box containing five finished piston cranks, coated with oil and individually wrapped in paper.

    Not only automated machine tool assembly lines have been established, but also comprehensive mechanized workshops and automated factories have been established. This is a major achievement of the Soviet Union in technology.

    At present, Soviet scholars and engineers are studying the establishment of a series of new factories and automated workshops to produce parts for automobiles and tractors, as well as other mass-produced products.

    An automated factory for producing sleeve-type wheel chains has been built. This type of chain is widely used in various sectors of Soviet industry. The combine harvester manufacturing industry alone uses more than five million of these chains every year. The unique feature of this factory is that not only the production of individual parts, but also the production of the entire finished product is automated. The entire technological process, transportation between machine tools, inspection, and assembly are completely automated. Among the seven automated production lines, the first six produce individual parts, and the last one assembles the finished product.

    The automated factory can perform six different processes in one second: loading, pressing, cutting, moving, hemming, and grooving. Highly complex and highly precise units are installed on the automated production line. These machines equipped with mechanical arms assemble individual parts into finished products.

    The equipment of the automated factory consists of 150 machine tools and units, which increases labor productivity by six times and reduces product costs by half.

    Now, not only in factories that carry out mass production, but also in enterprises that produce complete sets of products, comprehensive mechanization and partial automation are being carried out. The Soviet Union has used flexible mechanized assembly lines and automated assembly lines that can be quickly adjusted for the first time in the world.

    During the period of 1959-1965, the Gorky Automobile Factory will establish 136 automated and semi-automated production lines, install conveyor belts with a total length of 20 kilometers, and 1,400 specialized combined machine tools, and update 4,000 different types of equipment. As a result of the implementation of these and other measures, the annual output of the Gorky Automobile Factory will almost double by 1965.

    In the period up to 1975, the adoption of automated assembly lines will have broader prospects. By 1975, the Soviet machine manufacturing industry will have 35,000 automated assembly lines in the mechanical manufacturing workshops alone.

    The development of technical science has special significance for the rapid realization of comprehensive mechanization and automation of production processes. The problems of comprehensive mechanization and automation must be solved under such conditions: that is, machinists, mathematicians, physicists, and other experts carry out close cooperation in various sectors of the machine manufacturing industry. The widespread participation of millions of production innovators and advanced producers in this work is of great significance for the successful realization of comprehensive mechanization and automation of production processes. They can use collective experience and wisdom to help solve many complex problems.

    Comprehensive mechanization and automation of production, while widely updating existing equipment with the adoption of more advanced technological processes, can guarantee the further upsurge of socialist industry. The objective process of historical development has put the necessity of solving this task before the Soviet people. Successfully solving this task can guarantee the increase of the output of various products, thereby further promoting the improvement of the material welfare of the Soviet people, and defeating the capitalist system in peaceful competition.

    苏联工业中的自动化和机械化问题
    苏联　库兹涅佐夫教授
    生产过程的全盘机械化和自动化，是苏联科学和技术进步的主要方向之一。目前，苏联的科学家、工程师和实际从事社会主义生产的人，都在着手解决机械化和自动化的问题。
    生产过程的全盘机械化和自动化，是从数量和质量上提高社会劳动生产率，是减少设备停歇、增加设备运转率的基本科学方法。在苏联，科学技术的蓬勃发展为这方面的进步打下了基础。
    应当指出，综合机械化并不是简单地用机器代替手工劳动，而是在相当高度的技术水平上使所有工序自动化，也就是采用一整套相互协作的机器。
    苏联1959年至1965年发展国民经济的计划规定，要在生产过程全盘机械化的基础上完全消灭国民经济一切部门中的繁重手工劳动。将由某些机组、机器装置的自动化过渡到全盘自动化，以及建立完全自动化的车间甚至企业。
    计算技术的成就为生产过程的自动化开辟了广阔的前途。采用现代化计算机，可以自动地按照最有利的条件选择和进行工艺过程。随着计算技术的发展，可以逐渐使复杂的生产项目、传送装置、车间和整个工厂完全自动化。这项任务在有着不间断的生产过程的企业里，最易于实现。
    除了完成自动化工作的总计划（计划规定至少建立一千三百个大型自动化作业线）以外，准备在各工业部门建立五十个以上的试验性企业，来实现全盘自动化的最新方案。这种类型的企业，将是全面开展共产主义建设阶段的新型生产的范例。建立全盘自动化生产的示范性企业，就是为了取得全盘自动化的经验。
    在苏联发展生产过程的全盘机械化和自动化，具有全民意义。目前苏联的科学技术水平为工业中广泛实行全盘机械化和自动化创造了条件，并且有可能建立起一系列新型的、进行各种不同部门生产的全盘自动化企业。
    机器制造企业为自己的需要而建立的千百个小型自动化作业线，目前已在顺利地转动着。计划利用企业的力量再建立一千五百至二千个自动化作业线。仅在拖拉机和农业机器制造厂就要建立二百个自动化作业线，以便生产大批最耗费劳动的制品。
    机器制造企业已经扩大了生产效率高的机器和设备的产量。它们采用了自动化、半自动化和机械化的流水作业线，为国民经济各部门设计，并生产了示范性的新型机器、设备和仪器，此外还在生产的进一步专业化和协作方面采取了措施。
    大家知道，苏联整个国民经济发展的速度和技术水平主要取决于对机器、机械和其他设备的需要满足的程度，以及这些机器、设备的完善程度。
    拥有现代化的原子设备、电子计算机，发射人造地球卫星，制造强大的洲际弹道火箭以及掌握其他先进技术，如果没有各式各样的自动化装备、机器和仪器则是不可想像的。
    自动化和机械化的发展，要经过这样几个阶段：个别机器和机组的自动化（如自动化和半自动化机床），一个系统的机器操作的自动化（如自动化机床流水作业线，自动化工段、车间）以及最后的全盘自动化，即建立自动化工厂。
    在全盘自动化的情况下，所有的基本工序和辅助工序，包括由一个生产周期到另一个周期，全都不用人管。工人仅仅负责调整生产过程，注意机器操作的情况，防止停歇和事故。
    目前，苏联已生产了很大数量的各式各样的自动化机器。生产了一种由专门的仪器操纵的万能旋床。这种旋床是用来旋制各种形状的复杂零件的。在带刻度数的特制圆盘上，根据需要切削的零件的尺寸把机床调整好。在一个圆盘上调整零件的长度；在另一个圆盘上调整零件的直径。然后，工人一按电钮机床便动起来了：车刀自动地接近备件，按照需要的尺寸向纵深和横面切旋，然后不停歇地根据规定的直径继续旋下刨花。零件作好以后，车刀自动回到原来的状态。旋工取下零件，放上新的备件，然后再开动车床。
    这个自动化机床不出废品，它制造的零件经常保持3％公厘的精确度。它的调整器在移换零件时只消一分半钟和二分钟。旋工不需要守在机床跟前，他可以同时看管几台这样的自动化机床。
    但是，在生产中采用一批单个的，即使是非常完善的自动机器，无论过去和现在都不能完全解决自动化的全部任务。因为一系列辅助工序（送料、上料、定准中心位置、控制尺寸、制成零件的取卸和搬运、清理刨花等等）还没有自动化。结果，使用自动化机器加速生产过程的效果，往往被辅助工序的损失给抵消了。
    建立自动化机床流水作业线，解决了这个任务。而且在许多场合下，这些作业线是在现有设备的基础上建立起来的。在苏联的好些先进企业中，建立了联动机床自动化流水作业线。
    实践证明，自动化流水作业线，既能大大地提高劳动生产率，而且可以减轻工人的劳动，以外还能缩减设备所占的场地面积，缩短生产周期的时间和用于上料、定料和固定中心位置的所谓辅助生产时间。这些作业线还有助于保持严格的生产节奏，加速机器转数和降低产品成本。
    在苏联的汽车工厂里可以见到制作弹簧的自动化机床作业线。在这里用填料的自动机把钢板填进切钢板的机器，切成所需要的尺寸。每隔三秒钟就有一批切好的钢板被机器送到一条传送带上。这个传送带不是一直转动，而是有间歇的。移动钢板的位置时，用的是一种有“走动齿条”的机器装置，它们把未来的弹簧的零件从一架自动机搬到另一架自动机。
    为了使所有的机器都开动起来，自动化流水作业线还装有水压装置。切好的钢板还要经过三十二道工序：钻孔、加热、压制凸面、硬化、加固系数、试验硬度等等。每隔四十八秒钟就从传送带上自动地卸下一批制成的弹簧。
    这个自动化流水作业线，每年可以生产二百万以上的弹簧。在这个自动化流水作业线上工作的工人人数，只有机械化弹簧车间工人的十七分之一。
    生产过程的全盘机械化和自动化，还包括这样一些工作，例如装配部件和成品，这在过去是使用手工劳动的。在苏联有制造和装配汽车轮的自动化作业线。从前由人来作的一切工序，不仅机械化，而且自动化了。机器在焊接轮圈，磨平毛刺，开凿汽门的开口。钢坯经过一套搬运机，从一个工序转到另一个工序，而且每隔三十秒和四十秒，主要传送带的吊钩上就吊起了一个作好的车轮。要知道，这里所说的车轮重量有二十八公斤。从前，工人在一班内要搬运一吨钢铁。现在已经有几十个工人摆脱了沉重的体力劳动。整个自动化作业线只要三个调整工、一个检查员和一个辅助工就够了。
    在苏联还有生产拖拉机活塞曲柄的自动化车间。在这个车间里，从切料到包装成品的一切工序都是机械化的。调整工在操作台前仔细地观察生产过程。生产过程中一旦发生毛病，这里的信号灯就亮了。自动的检查仪器不容许有一公尺百万分之三的差错。每个小时从自动化车间里送出六十个厚纸盒子，每个盒子里都有五个作成的活塞曲柄，上面涂了油，并且都是用纸单独包好了的。
    不仅建立自动化机床作业线，而且建立了全盘机械化车间和自动化工厂。这是苏联在技术方面的重大成就。
    目前，苏联学者和工程师正在研究建立一系列新的工厂、自动化车间来生产汽车和拖拉机的零件，以及其它大量生产的制品。
    已经建成了一个生产套筒式轮链的自动化工厂。苏联工业的各个部门正在广泛地使用这种链子。仅康拜因机制造业，每年就要使用五百多万个这种链子。这个工厂与众不同的特点，就是不仅生产个别零件，而且整个成品的生产都自动化了。整个工艺过程、机床之间的运输、检查和装配，都完全是自动化的。七个自动化作业线中，前六个生产个别零件，最后一个装配成品。
    自动化工厂在一秒钟内可以作六个不同的工序：上料、压料、切料、搬活、卷边和作轧槽。自动化作业线上安装着十分复杂和高度精确的机组。这些装有机械手臂的机器把个别零件装配成成品。
    自动化工厂的设备由一百五十个机床、机组组成，劳动生产率提高了六倍，而产品成本则减少了一半。
    现在不仅在进行大批生产的工厂里，而且在生产成套产品的企业里也在进行全盘机械化和部分自动化的工作。苏联在世界上破天荒第一次使用了灵活的机械化流水作业线，和可以迅速调整的自动化作业线。
    在1959—1965年间，高尔基汽车工厂将建立一百三十六个自动化和半自动化作业线，安装总长二十公里的传送带和一千四百个专门的联动机床，并且更新四千种不同的设备。由于实现这些以及其它措施的结果，到1965年高尔基汽车工厂的年产量将几乎增为一倍半。
    到1975年为止的一段时期内，采用自动化作业线将有着更广阔的前途。到1975年，苏联机器制造工业中仅机械制造车间就将拥有三万五千个自动化作业线。
    发展技术科学对于尽快地实现生产过程的全盘机械化和自动化有着特殊的意义。全盘机械化和自动化问题，必须在这样的条件下来解决。即机械师、数学家、物理学家，以及其它专家们在机器制造业各部门中进行密切的合作。广泛地吸收千百万的生产革新者和先进生产者参加这一工作，对于顺利地实现生产过程的全盘机械化和自动化，具有巨大的意义。他们可以用集体的经验和智慧，帮助解决许多复杂的问题。
    生产的全盘机械化和自动化，在采用更进步的工艺过程的同时广泛地更新现有设备，这可以保证社会主义工业的进一步高涨。历史发展的客观进程，在苏联人民面前提出了解决这一任务的必要性。顺利地解决这一任务可以保证增加各种产品的产量，从而更加促进苏联人民物质福利的提高，以及在和平竞赛中战胜资本主义制度。
