Old Soldier's Wheat Field Contest
    Tóng Xiàolíng

The vast Huaibei Plain has become a golden sea of wheat. Our brigade, sent to support the wheat harvest, was swallowed up by the rolling waves of wheat as soon as we left the city.

At noon, the sun was like a giant fireball, turning our faces red, soaking us in sweat, and drenching all our clothes. But the joy of the harvest dispelled the heat and fatigue. People rolled in the sea of wheat. The "snip, snip" of scythes was accompanied by cheerful songs and heartfelt laughter, sometimes loud, sometimes soft, lingering for a long time.

In my haste, I looked up and glanced at our Deputy Political Commissar. Sometime ago, he had taken off his shirt and was working with his bare back. He straightened his waist and extended his arms, skillfully wielding his sickle. With the sound of "snip, snip, snip," the wheat taller than our heads immediately fell, like a channel cut through the ocean by a majestic warship. Not to mention us novices who were just "learning the ropes" in the wheat field, even the young production team leader of the commune was left three or four feet behind by our Deputy Political Commissar. He was working hard, anxiously trying to catch up with the Deputy Political Commissar!

The Deputy Political Commissar's amazing speed in harvesting wheat attracted everyone's attention. Suddenly, a farmer nearly fifty years old walked over with a vigorous stride, getting closer and closer. I recognized him as Deputy Director Li of the People's Commune. He was a well-known production expert and a provincial labor model.

"Director Li, you're here!"

"Oh, it's Comrade Staff Officer! Thank you all." The old Director Li spoke to me, but his two bright eyes were fixed on our Deputy Political Commissar. After a slight pause, he turned his face, lowered his voice slightly, and pointed to the Deputy Political Commissar, asking me, "Who is that comrade? He's like a harvester!"

"Our Deputy Political Commissar, a general who just returned from Korea last year."

"General?" Director Li opened his eyes in surprise. He joked, "Generals show their power on the battlefield, but here… haha, here is the 'arena' for heroes on our agricultural front!"

The Director's voice grew louder and louder. Obviously, his words were heard by the Deputy Political Commissar. He smiled and walked over to shake hands with the Director, asking:

"I just heard Comrade Staff Officer call you Director Li, is that right?"

"Yes, I am the Deputy Director of this commune. And you are..."

"I am a veteran!" The general squinted his eyes and said with a smile, "From your words, it sounds like you want to compete with me, is that right?"

This was exactly what Director Li wanted. He chuckled and reached out to snatch my sickle, saying, "I can also be considered a veteran, let's see who's better in two hours."

An intense competition began. The two respectable old men were truly like contestants in a ring, one stroke of your knife, one sweep of his scythe, neither willing to yield.

To watch this lively scene, we all sped up, closely following behind the General and the old Director Li. To cheer them on, we even shouted like mischievous children from time to time.

Time flew by, and the wheat fell as if swept by a gust of wind. An hour and a half passed, and four hundred mu, nearly two li long, of wheat had already been harvested by four-fifths. Seeing that we were not far from the end of the wheat field, the General and the old Director Li were still advancing shoulder to shoulder. Unexpectedly, the General was ahead of the old Director by a handful of wheat. However, the old Director Li did not show any weakness, he kept harvesting non-stop, without even taking the time to wipe his sweat.

The General stood up and asked:

"Old brother, how is it?"

"It can't be said that you've won yet!" The old Director Li said unconvinced, "I will definitely catch up with you."

Two hours passed, and the General and the old Director Li reached the end of the field almost at the same minute. They looked at each other and laughed, put down their sickles, linked arms, walked to the shady trees on the edge of the field, sat down on the soft grass, and drank cool boiled water.

Director Li drank water and gave the Deputy Political Commissar a thumbs up, saying, "You're really good! You're both a general leading troops and a wheat-harvesting expert!"

After resting, the Deputy Political Commissar and the old Director Li picked up the sickles I had sharpened for them and led us into a new battle.

    老兵麦田比武记
    童笑皊
    广阔的淮北平原，成了金黄色的麦海。我们支援麦收的大队，刚走出城就被翻滚的麦浪吞没了。
    正午，太阳像一个巨大的火团，把我们晒得满脸通红，汗流浃背，全身的衣服都湿透了。但是丰收的喜悦驱散了炎热和疲劳，人们在麦海里滚动着，“嚓嚓”的割麦声伴和着愉快的歌声和发自心坎里的笑声，时高时低，久久不息。
    匆忙中，我抬起头，看了我们的副政委一眼。不知什么时候，他已脱去了上衣，光着脊背在干活。他挺腰伸臂，熟练地挥舞着镰刀。随着“嚓嚓嚓”的响声，高过头顶的小麦立即倒下，像是海洋被威风凛凛的军舰冲出的一道沟，甭说是我们这些刚刚在麦田“学艺”的新手，就连那公社年轻的生产队长，也被我们的副政委撇到后面三、四尺远。他正鼓起劲，焦急地追赶着副政委呢！
    副政委割麦的惊人速度引起了大伙的注意。突然，一位年近五十的农民迈着矫健的步伐走了过来，他越走越近。我认出这是人民公社的李副主任。他是远近知名的生产能手、省劳动模范。
    “李主任，是您来了啊！”
    “噢，是参谋同志啊！谢谢你们了。”老社主任和我说着话，两只炯炯发光的眼睛却盯着我们的副政委。稍停，他转过脸来，稍稍压低了嗓门指着副政委问我：“那是哪位同志，像架收割机似的？”
    “我们的副政委，去年才从朝鲜回来的一位将军。”
    “将军？”李主任惊奇地睁大了眼睛。他开玩笑似地说：“将军们逞威风是在杀敌的战场上，这里……哈哈，这里是我们农业战线上英雄们的‘擂台’！”
    主任的嗓门越来越大，显然他的话让副政委听见了。他笑着走过来和主任握手，问道：
    “刚才听参谋同志叫你李主任，是吗？”
    “对，我是这个公社的副主任。你是……”
    “我是一名老兵！”将军眯缝着两眼笑嘻嘻的说，“听你的话里的意思是想和我见见高低，是吗？”
    这话说对了李主任的心。他嘿嘿地笑起来，伸手夺过我的镰刀说：“我也算得一个老兵哩，咱们两个钟头见高下。”
    一场激烈的竞赛开始了，两位可敬的老人，真像是在擂台比武一样，你一刀他一镰，互不相让。
    为了看这热闹的场面，我们全都加快了速度，紧跟在将军和老社主任的后面。为了给他们打气，还不时孩子般淘气的叫喊着。
    时间飞驰而过，小麦如被疾风吹卷一样倒下来。一个半小时过去了，四百亩、近两华里长的一块小麦已经割下五分之四，看看已离麦地尽头不远，将军和老社主任依然并肩前进着；出人意料的是，将军还先社主任一把麦。然而，老社主任也并没示弱，他不歇手地割，顾不得擦拭汗水。
    将军站起来问：
    “老哥哥，怎么样？”
    “现在还不能算是你胜利了啊！”老社主任不服气地说：“我一定要赶过你去。”
    两个小时过去了，将军和老社主任几乎在同一分钟内割到地头。他们两人对看着笑了起来，放下镰刀，挽着手，走到地头树荫下茸茸的草地上坐下来，喝着凉开水。
    李主任一面喝水，一面竖起大拇指冲着副政委说：“真行！是领兵的将军，又是割麦的能手啊！”
    休息完了，副政委和老社主任拿起我为他们磨得锋利的镰刀，带领着我们又投入了新的战斗。
