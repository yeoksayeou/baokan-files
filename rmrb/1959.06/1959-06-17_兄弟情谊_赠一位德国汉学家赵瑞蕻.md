    Brotherly Affection
    ——A Gift to a German Sinologist
    Zhao Ruihong
    Please listen to a tune of "Bamboo Branch Song,"
    And write new poems with ancient melodies;
    There is no green bamboo in these mountains,
    But admire its elegance from paintings.
    On the white wall, a bamboo painting stretches,
    The wall is filled with books in Chinese;
    Beneath the bamboo, drinking Rhine wine merrily,
    Sharing our feelings and laughing before the lamp.
    "I wish to plant green bamboos by the stream,
    And build a pavilion in the dense forest;
    The sound of the Xiao flute comes from the green peaks,
    Plum blossoms have fallen, peach blossoms bloom.
    The spring is radiant in the bamboo forest,
    Ladies are all dressed in brocade garments;
    At the Easter outing,
    Their skirts flutter, more beautiful than rainbows."
    "I wish to plant white birches on both sides of the Yellow River,
    Supporting the sky;
    High buildings rise along the roadside,
    Steel factories emit thick smoke.
    Wide roads run through the countryside and cities,
    Cars travel in all directions;
    Invite a German dance troupe,
    To perform in the small city's theater."
    After speaking, we raise our glasses in celebration,
    Grape wine and bamboo branch songs;
    Cultural exchange has existed since ancient times,
    Brotherly affection abounds today!

    兄弟情谊
    ——赠一位德国汉学家
    赵瑞蕻
    请听一曲竹枝词，
    且将古调写新诗；
    此地山中无翠竹，
    但从画里看风姿。
    粉墙上有墨竹横，
    满壁图书是汉文；
    竹下畅饮莱因酒，
    灯前谈笑各抒情。
    “我愿溪边翠竹栽，
    茂林深处有亭台；
    洞箫声自青峰下，
    梅花落尽桃花开。
    春光烂漫竹林里，
    仕女齐着锦缎衣；
    复活节日踏青处，
    裙裾飘舞胜虹霓。”
    “我愿黄河两岸间，
    遍植白桦撑苍天；
    座座高楼道旁起，
    钢铁工厂冒浓烟。
    广阔公路穿城乡，
    汽车来往通四方；
    邀请德国歌舞团，
    小城剧院好登场。”
    语罢举杯同祝贺，
    葡萄美酒竹枝歌；
    文化交流自古有，
    兄弟情谊今日多！
