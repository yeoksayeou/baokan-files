    Did you know?
    Bees leaving the hive indicate a sunny day
    The sky was covered by a dark gray cloud, with not a single break to be found. Several young people from the Jining Special District Meteorological Observatory in Shandong were looking up at the sky, discussing the future weather conditions. But no one was confident enough to say that it would be sunny today.
    Coincidentally, their words were heard by an old beekeeping farmer across the way. The old farmer said to them: "It won't rain today, because the bees all went out of the hive to collect honey early this morning. If it was going to rain, the bees wouldn't go out to collect honey."
    After the young people returned to the station, they decisively issued the weather forecast according to his advice. The actual weather situation that day was: overcast in the morning, the clouds gradually broke open in the afternoon, and the weather turned sunny in the evening.
    The reason why the activity of bees can predict a sunny day is that, on the one hand, when the weather turns sunny, the air pressure rises and the humidity decreases, which is conducive to the bees' outdoor activities; on the other hand, the nectar secreted by the pistils is closely related to the climatic conditions. When plants secrete nectar, they emit a scent that attracts insects. When the weather turns sunny, the scent that attracts insects is stronger, which makes it even more likely to attract bees to go out and collect honey.
    Chickens reluctant to enter the coop indicate coming rain
    It's already dusk, why are the chickens still reluctant to enter the coop?
    Before it rains in summer, the air pressure is low and the humidity is high. Many small insects have difficulty flying high and fly close to the ground; some small animals in caves feel uncomfortable and mostly run out of the ground or attach themselves to the leaves of grass. This creates a good opportunity for chickens to forage, so of course they are reluctant to enter the coop.
    There is another reason. Chickens are covered in feathers. When the air pressure is low and the humidity is high in summer, it is too uncomfortable for them to return to the coop due to the stuffy heat; if the "four pests" have not been completely eliminated, they have to endure mosquito bites when they return to the coop. For these reasons, they are of course reluctant to enter the coop.
    Lin Fenglin, a teacher at Rongxian No. 2 Middle School in Guangxi, used this phenomenon to make weather forecasts at their school.
    Loach swimming indicates a change in the weather
    In the house of the Xintang People's Commune meteorological post in Jiujiang City, Jiangxi, there is a large glass bottle with a loach living in it.
    The staff of the meteorological post have to take a look at this loach every day at a certain time. On a sunny day, it sinks to the bottom of the bottle and does not move at all. On cloudy days, or cloudy days, it becomes active in the bottle and swims back and forth. On rainy days, it swims even more vigorously, sometimes swimming upstream and sometimes sinking downstream. People observed it continuously for fifty-seven days, and it always started to move a few hours before the weather changed.
    This is a method that Ling Shisong, a staff member of this meteorological post, came up with after visiting other meteorological posts that used leeches to forecast the weather. Loaches and leeches have very similar living habits. The test results show that the accuracy rate of using loaches to forecast the weather can reach more than 96%, which is even better than leeches.
    "Turtle shell damp, a sign of rain"
    Hunan proverb: "Turtle shell damp, a sign of rain." In summer and early spring and late autumn, turtles can be used to forecast the weather. Turtles are cold-blooded animals, and their shells easily dissipate heat, so their temperature is lower than the air temperature. When it is about to rain, a large amount of water vapor is mixed in the air. These water vapors become heated and lighter with the increase of ground temperature, and condense into rainwater when they rise into the high altitude; some of the water vapor close to the ground will also condense on the low-temperature turtle shell and produce moisture. Therefore, when the turtle shell is wet, it proves that it is about to rain.
    The turtle shell is relatively accurate for measuring hot thunderstorms that often occur in summer and early spring and late autumn. Because the sunlight is strong in summer, and the air is full of water vapor before a thunderstorm, but not every time before it rains, there is enough water vapor to make the turtle shell wet, so it often rains when the turtle shell is wet, but it does not necessarily mean that it will not rain when the turtle shell is dry.

    你知道吗？
    蜜蜂出窝天放晴
    天空笼罩着灰暗色的云幕，找不出半点隙缝。山东济宁专区气象台的几个年青人仰望天空，讨论着未来的天气情况。但谁也没有把握说今天会放晴。
    碰巧，他们的话被对面的养蜂老农听到了。老农对他们说：“今天不会下雨了，因为，一清早蜜蜂都出窝采蜜去了，如果要下雨，蜜蜂就不会出去采蜜。”
    几个年青人回台后，就果断地按照他的意见发布了天气预报。这天的天气实况是：上午天气阴沉，下午云渐裂开，傍晚天气转晴。
    蜜蜂的活动，所以能够预示出晴天，一方面是因为天气转晴时气压升高，湿度减小，有利于蜜蜂的外出活动；另方面是因为花蕊分泌的甜汁和气候条件有着密切的关系。植物在分泌甜汁时，会发散出能引诱昆虫的气味，天气转晴时，诱惑昆虫的气味厉害，这就更能引诱蜜蜂外出采蜜。
    鸡不入笼阴雨来
    已经傍晚了，怎么鸡还迟迟不愿入笼？
    夏天下雨前，气压低，湿度大，许多小昆虫高飞困难而贴地低飞；有些在洞里的小动物不舒服起来，多半跑出地面或者附着在草叶上。这给鸡造成了觅食的好机会，它当然迟迟不愿进到笼里去。
    还有一个理由。鸡满身是羽光，当夏天气压低、湿度大的时候，它要回到笼里，闷热得太不舒服了；如果是在四害没有除尽的地方，它回到笼里还要忍受蚊虫的袭击。这一来，它当然也迟迟不愿入笼。
    广西容县第二中学教师林凤麟，在他们学校里利用这一现象做了天气预报。
    泥鳅游动天将变
    江西九江市新塘人民公社气象哨的屋子里，摆着一个大玻璃瓶，瓶里一条泥鳅孤寂地呆着。
    气象哨的工作人员，每天在一定时间都要去瞅瞅这条泥鳅。大晴天，它下沉瓶底一动也不动。阴天，或者多云的天，它在瓶中活跃起来，来回游动。下雨天，它游动得更厉害，一会上游，一会又下沉。人们一连观察了五十七天，它总是在天气变化前几小时就开始活动起来。
    这是这个气象哨的工作人员凌仕松，在参观了别的气象哨用蚂蝗预报天气以后想出的办法。泥鳅和蚂蝗的生活习惯很相似，试验结果证明，用泥鳅预报天气的准确率可以达到96％以上，比蚂蝗还好。
    “龟背潮，下雨兆”
    湖南谚语：“龟背潮，下雨兆。”在夏天和春末秋初，可以利用乌龟预报天气。乌龟是冷血动物，龟甲容易散热，它的温度比气温低。天将要下雨的时候，空气中掺入了大量的水蒸气，这些水蒸气随着地面温度的增高而受热变轻，升入高空时，遇冷凝结就成雨水；接近地面的水蒸气中，有部分也会在低温的龟背上凝结而产生湿润。因此龟背湿润的时候，证明天将要下雨了。
    龟背，对测定夏天和春末秋初常发生的热雷雨，是比较准确的。因为夏天阳光强烈，雷雨前空气中的水蒸气充足，但也不一定每一次下雨之前，水蒸气都多得足以使龟背湿润，所以龟背湿时常常下雨，龟背干时却不一定不下雨。
