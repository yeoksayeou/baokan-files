Returning from Moscow

I just came back from Moscow, and my emotions are running high. When I get excited, I easily forget the writing principles of the Tongcheng School and the first and second points of reportage. It's possible that this report (even though it's short) will be disorganized. I hope the writing can be fervent, to make up for forgetting the first and second points! I'm not advocating "muddle-headedness," if there is such an ideology.

The Third Soviet Writers' Congress opened in Moscow on May 18th. Mao Dun, Yu Heidīng and I represented the Chinese Writers Association to offer our congratulations.

There, I met many old friends, got to know quite a few new ones, shook hands, embraced, said hello, smiled at each other... Who had time to talk about point one, our warm embrace, and point two, how is your wife?

Look, isn't that my old neighbor Comrade Rogov? (He was my neighbor in Beijing.) After a warm embrace, he immediately invited me to visit the editorial department of the "Sino-Soviet Friendship" magazine. After drinking a cup of tea, he asked me: What are your impressions of Moscow this time?

I blurted out: What impresses me most is the joy and happiness of everyone, everywhere!

Didn't I see how many plain but beautiful buildings have been added to Moscow? Didn't I see so many new products in the department stores? ... Of course I saw them! But it's difficult to describe these things in a few words, or to get to the root of the matter easily. What's the root? The people of the entire Soviet Union are joyfully building communism! Engaged in this unprecedented great undertaking, how can they not be full of joy and happiness everywhere?

This Writers' Congress was convened in such a great era. With this in mind, we can easily see the historical significance of this congress. Even if you couldn't be there in person, you can well imagine how excited, proud, and honored the Soviet writers' representatives attending the congress must have been! The fact is just that. They happily gathered together, encouraging each other on how to write about the face of the great era and the heroic figures of communist construction. What a glorious and lofty task!

Listening to the reports and speeches at the congress, my heart wanted to jump out. I thought: Work hard, Chinese writers! Yes, as long as we work hard and make progress, the glorious task of Soviet writers will come to us as well. We have always regarded Soviet writers as good teachers and helpful friends. Judging from today's situation, we should learn more from our good teachers and helpful friends, so that there is absolutely no stagnation in our literary cause. We want to be torrents, leaping forward day and night. Yes, what Soviet writers depict today will allow all of mankind to see the tomorrow that mankind should have. Socialist realist literature truly has the power to inspire people all over the world. We are also creators of socialist realist literature, so let's have greater ambitions!

Upon entering the venue, I couldn't help but think of two most precious words – unity! Don't think I'm saying that Soviet writers are very united. This statement is not comprehensive enough. I want to say: The literature of all Soviet nationalities has matured. This is really a big deal, let's applaud and congratulate them warmly! Look, not only writers of different schools, but even writers of different nationalities are united like brothers and sisters, serving the construction of communism together. This is an invincible force!

It may be a bit messy, but I have to interject: We watched two operas and three ballets at the Grand Theater, all performed by artists from Azerbaijan who came to Moscow. According to experts, these programs were really remarkable. They especially praised the music of the ballet "Seven Beauties," which has reached world-class level. This confirms that the artistic creation of various nationalities has indeed achieved great heights. In terms of literary works alone, the mutual translation of books by various nationalities has become an extremely important task.

Delegations from various brotherly countries attended the congress, and many progressive writers from Western countries also came to offer their congratulations. Here, the meaning of unity is even greater. Without a doubt, socialist realist literature is already worldwide. This force is enough to defeat any revisionism and all evil forces. No matter how viciously revisionists attack us, it will not hinder socialist realist literature from rising like the rising sun, shining all over the world.

Another thing worth noting is the issue of cultivating young writers. The Central Committee of the CPSU's congratulatory message to the congress, Comrade Khrushchev's speech at the congress, and Comrade Surkov's report at the congress all emphasized this important issue. How to cultivate them? Please see Comrade Khrushchev's speech – which has been published in our newspapers. We should study those documents carefully and learn from experience regarding this issue. At the symposium at the Gorky Literary Institute, I also heard some valuable opinions, which I will introduce here: the institute not only gives young people literary knowledge, but also educates them on how to be a writer in terms of moral character; in this way, even if they cannot become outstanding writers, they can at least be loyal and reliable literary workers. The students of the institute come from all nationalities. The institute recruits students who must already have some life experience and work experience, and also have some literary talent. I think these methods are very good. The method of counting heads casually is certainly not very appropriate.

When the congress opened, Comrade Khrushchev and other party and government leaders attended the meeting; the same was true at the closing of the congress, and Comrade Khrushchev made a sincere and wonderful speech. In socialist countries, writers are so happy! The Party attaches so much importance to literature and respects writers! His speech moved all the writers present. After the meeting, a Western writer said to me: Comrade Khrushchev is so great: so democratic, so confident, so humorous, so understanding! The writer said this almost with tears in his eyes. I understand his feelings: Soviet writers are well united themselves and are always concerned and led by the Party; and look at Western countries, no one cares about the lives of writers, and the literary cause lives and dies on its own! After listening, I remembered: unity is happiness, and leadership enables the literary cause to achieve legitimate prosperity! I will end this article with these words.

### 归自莫斯科
老舍

    归自莫斯科
    老舍
    刚刚由莫斯科回来，感情激动。一激动，就容易把桐城派的文章义法和报告文学的第一点、第二点都忘了。说不定这篇报道（尽管很短）会写的杂乱无章。希望文字能够热辣辣的，以补忘掉第一点、第二点之过！我并不提倡“乱七八糟主义”啊，假若有这么一个主义的话。
    苏联第三次作家代表大会于5月18日在莫斯科开幕。茅盾，于黑丁和我代表中国作家协会前往祝贺。
    在那里，见到了许多老朋友，认识了不少新朋友，握手，拥抱，问好，相视而笑……谁顾得说第一点咱们热烈拥抱，第二点我问您的太太好呢？
    看，那不是老邻居罗果夫同志么？（他在北京时与我为邻。）热情地互相拥抱之后，他马上约我到
  “苏中友好”杂志编辑部去参观。喝过一杯茶，他问我：这次到莫斯科来，印象如何？
    我脱口而出地回答：给我印象最深的是人人处处喜气洋洋！
    难道我没看见莫斯科又添盖了多少座朴素而美观的大楼吗？没看见百货店中那么多的新货品吗？……当然看见了！可是提起这些东西就很难以三言两语地说完，或者也不易说到根儿上。什么根儿呢？全苏人民正在兴高彩烈地建设共产主义呀！作着这史无前例的伟大事业，怎能够不人人处处都喜气洋洋呢？
    这次的作家代表大会就是在这么个伟大时代召开的。这么一说，我们就容易看清楚这次大会的历史意义。即使未能亲临其境，也颇可以想像到参加大会的苏联作家代表们该是多么兴奋，多么骄傲，多么光荣！事实也正是如此。他们都喜气洋洋地欢聚一堂，相互鼓舞怎样写出伟大时代的面貌和建设共产主义的英雄人物。何等光荣崇高的任务啊！
    听了大会上的报告与发言，我的心要跳出来。我想：努力呀，中国的作家！是的，只要我们努力进取，苏联作家的光荣任务也会来到我们自己身上啊。我们一向以苏联作家为良师益友，由今天的形势看起来，我们就更应当多向良师益友学习，叫我们的文学事业绝对没有静止现象。我们要作激流，不舍昼夜地跳跃前进。是呀，苏联作家笔下所描绘的今天，会使全人类看到人类应有的明天。社会主义现实主义文学的确有振奋全世界人心的力量。我们也是社会主义现实主义文学的创作者，就叫我们的抱负远大些吧！
    一进入会场，不由地就想起两个最宝贵的字来——团结！别以为我要说苏联作家团结的很好，这个说法还不够全面。我是要说：苏联各民族的文学都已成熟了。这真是件大事，让我们热烈鼓掌祝贺吧！看，不但流派不同的作家呀，连不同民族的作家也都手足一般地团结起来，一同为建设共产主义服务。这是战无不胜的力量！
    乱点就乱点吧，还得横插一笔：我们这次在大剧院看了两出歌剧和三出芭蕾舞，都是由阿塞拜疆的艺术家到莫斯科演出的。据专家们说，这些节目实在了不起。他们特别称赞“七美图”舞剧的音乐，已达世界水平。这证实了各民族的文艺创作确已获得很高的成就。单就文学作品来说，各民族互相译书已成为一件极为重要的工作。
    各兄弟国家都有代表团出席大会，还有许多西方国家的进步作家也来祝贺。于此，团结的意义可就更大了。毫无疑问，社会主义现实主义的文学已是世界范围的了。这个力量足以打退任何修正主义与一切邪魔外道。不管修正主义者怎样恶毒地攻击我们，也无碍社会主义现实主义的文学如旭日东升，普照全世。
    另一件值得注意的，就是培养青年作家的问题。苏共中央对大会的祝词，赫鲁晓夫同志在大会上的讲话，和苏尔科夫同志在大会上作的报告，都着重地提到这个重要问题。怎样培养呢？请看赫鲁晓夫同志的讲话——已发表在咱们的报纸上。对于这个问题，我们应当好好地学习那些文件，吸取经验。在高尔基文学讲习所的座谈会上，我也听到一些宝贵的意见，介绍在这里：讲习所不单给青年们以文学知识，而且在道德品质上教育他们如何作个作家；这样，即使他们不能成为一个卓越的作家，至少也能作个忠诚可靠的文艺工作者。讲习所的学员来自各民族。讲习所招收的学员必定已具有一些生活经验与劳动经验，而且要有些文学才能。我觉得这些办法很好。摸摸脑袋就算一个的办法一定是不怎么妥当的。
    大会开幕，赫鲁晓夫同志同党、政领导人到会；大会闭幕，也是如此，并由赫鲁晓夫同志作了恳切而精彩的发言。在社会主义国家里，作家是多么幸福啊！党是多么重视文学事业，尊重作家呀！他的发言感动了所有在场的作家。会后，一位西方的作家对我说：赫鲁晓夫同志是多么伟大呀：那么民主，那么自信，那么幽默，那么通达！这位作家差不多是含着泪这样说的。我了解他的心情：苏联作家自己团结得好，而且时刻受到党的关切与领导；再看西方国家呢，作家生活没人过问，文学事业自生自灭！听完了，我想起来：团结就是幸福，领导使文学事业得到堂堂正正的繁荣！即以此语结束此文。
