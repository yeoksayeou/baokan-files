    Domestic Situation Tense, Reactionary Forces Active
    Argentine Cabinet Begins Reorganization
    (Comprehensive report from this newspaper) Buenos Aires News: Following the resignation of the Argentine Frondizi government's cabinet on the 22nd, reorganization began on the 24th. On that day, President Frondizi, in the heavily guarded capital, announced the approval of the resignation of most cabinet members and appointed some new cabinet members.
    According to the Presidential Press Office, the resignations of the Ministers of Economy, Labor, Social Insurance, Defense, and Public Works, as well as some State Secretaries, were approved. The newly appointed Minister of Economy is Alsogaray (Chairman of the Independent Civic Party), who is also temporarily serving as Minister of Labor and Social Insurance. The former Minister of Public Works, Villar, was transferred to the post of Minister of Defense.
    It is reported that the new Minister of Economy, Alsogaray, has always advocated "free enterprise" and has strongly supported signing contracts with American companies for joint oil exploration. Taking office as Minister of Economy, he will have great power to strictly control the national economy. At the same time, he is also authorized to select the undersecretaries of the six departments under the Ministry of Economy—Agriculture, Finance, Treasury, Commerce, Industry and Mining, and Power and Fuel—and will propose candidates for the positions of Minister of Labor and Social Insurance, which he is currently temporarily holding. United Press International reporters meaningfully reported that "it seems that Frondizi has almost formed a cabinet of businessmen."
    This cabinet reshuffle is the result of continuous and strong pressure from the military. It is reported that the garrisons in various provinces demanded that the Frondizi government become more right-wing and reactionary, demanding "decisive reforms in government and political leadership."
    Frondizi was elected president in the February 1958 election with popular support. However, after taking office in May of the same year, he did not implement his election platform. On the contrary, he repeatedly adopted a policy of compromise and concession to US imperialism and domestic reactionaries. In January of this year, he implemented the so-called "economic stabilization plan," which favored US monopoly capital and domestic comprador forces. This plan, called "thrift and sacrifice," was formulated based on the harsh demands put forward by the United States through the "International Monetary Fund" in exchange for a loan to Argentina, creating conditions for foreign capital to invest and seize huge profits. Since the implementation of the "economic stabilization plan," Argentina's national production index has fallen by 4% compared to a year ago, and people's living expenses have increased by 50%. Therefore, this plan has been met with increasingly fierce opposition from the working people across the country, and has also aroused increasing dissatisfaction from some of the bourgeoisie. Even Garcia, chairman of the National Committee of the ruling "Intransigent Radical Civic Union," criticized the government's chosen path of economic development as "the most dangerous." He believes that the ruling party's policies have been "genuinely undermined" in the government. The implementation of the "economic stabilization plan" has made Argentina's political situation turbulent.
    In order to deal with popular discontent and resistance, US imperialism and domestic reactionary forces forced the Frondizi government to carry out a partial reorganization in May of this year to facilitate the implementation of policies that conform to their interests. However, domestic and foreign reactionaries believe that the reorganized government is still not resolute enough in implementing reactionary policies, so they have recently demanded a second reorganization. After Frondizi accepted the military's demands and reorganized the cabinet, the national situation remained tense. The Presidential Palace and all radio stations and public utilities in Buenos Aires are guarded by reinforced armed forces, and heavily armed military police patrol the key areas of the city from time to time. Former Vice President Admiral Isaac Rojas demanded Frondizi's resignation on the evening of the 23rd, threatening to launch a military coup if Frondizi refused to resign.

### 国内局势紧张　反动势力活跃  阿根廷内阁开始改组

    国内局势紧张　反动势力活跃
    阿根廷内阁开始改组
    本报综合报道　布宜诺斯艾利斯消息：阿根廷弗朗迪西政府内阁在22日宣布辞职后，已经在24日开始改组。这一天，弗朗迪西总统在戒备森严的首都宣布批准绝大部分阁员辞职，并任命了一部分新的内阁成员。
    据总统府新闻处宣布，被批准辞职的有经济部、劳工部、社会保险部、国防部和公共工程部的部长以及一些国务秘书。新任命的经济部长是阿耳索加赖（独立公民党主席），并临时兼任劳工和社会保险部长。原任公共工程部长比利亚尔调任为国防部长。
    据报道，新任经济部长阿耳索加赖一向主张“企业自由”，并竭力支持和美国公司签订共同开采石油的合同。这次出任经济部长将拥有对全国经济严格控制的大权。同时，他还被授权选任经济部所属的农业、财政、国库、商业、工矿及动力和燃料六部的次长，并将提出目前暂由他兼任的劳工和社会保险部的候选人。合众国际社记者意味深长地报道说，“看来弗朗迪西已差不多组成了一个商人内阁。”
    这次内阁的改组是在国内军方不断施加强大压力的结果。据报道，各省驻军要求弗朗迪西政府更加右倾倒退，要求“在政府和政治领导方面作出决定性的改革”。
    弗朗迪西是1958年2月大选中在人民支持下当选总统的。但是，他在同年5月就任以后，并没有贯彻执行他的竞选纲领，相反，他对美帝国主义和国内反动派一再采取了妥协退让的政策，今年1月，实行了有利于美国垄断资本和国内买办势力的所谓“稳定经济计划”，这个被称为“节约与牺牲”的计划是根据美国通过“国际货币基金组织”给予阿根廷一笔贷款提出的苛刻要求制定的，为外国资本创造投资和攫取巨额利润的条件。阿根廷自从实行“稳定经济计划”以来，全国的国民生产指数比一年前下降了4％，人民生活费用上涨了50％。因此，这个计划遭到了全国劳动人民越来越激烈的反对，同时也引起了部分资产阶级的日益不满。甚至执政党“不妥协激进公民联盟”全国委员会主席加西亚也批评政府所选定的经济发展道路是“最危险的”。他认为，执政党的政策在政府中遭到了“真正的破坏”。“稳定经济计划”的实施使阿根廷的政局动荡不安。
    美帝国主义和阿根廷国内反动势力为了对付人民的不满和反抗，曾在今年5月迫使弗朗迪西政府进行局部改组，以利于贯彻符合它们利益的政策。但是国内外反动派认为改组后的政府执行反动政策仍不够坚决，因此最近又要求第二次改组。弗朗迪西接受军方要求，改组内阁后，全国局势仍然很紧张。总统府以及布宜诺斯艾利斯所有的广播电台和公用事业都由加强的武装力量守卫，荷枪实弹的军警不时在城市要冲巡逻。前副总统伊萨克·罗哈斯海军少将并在23日晚要求弗朗迪西辞职，扬言说，如果弗朗迪西拒绝辞职，他将发动军事政变。
