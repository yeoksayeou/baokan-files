Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, May 31st: The 5,600-plus mother ducks of the Jin Ding Production Brigade in Zini Commune, Longxi County, Fujian Province, laid an average of 285 eggs per year from February of last year to February of this year. Among them, 240 improved breed mother ducks laid an average of 345 eggs per year.

The main experiences of the Jin Ding Brigade in increasing the egg production of mother ducks are: increasing the grazing time; in the autumn and winter seasons when the days are short and the nights are long, feeding additional feed at night; and when aquatic organisms decrease in winter, increasing supplementary feed or increasing bone meal, etc.

The Jin Ding Production Brigade is close to rivers and the sea. The local people use plankton in the water to feed ducks. It has always been famous throughout the province for raising many ducks, high egg production, large duck eggs, and good quality. Duck farming income accounts for about 20% of the total income of the entire brigade. At present, in addition to continuing to develop duck production, it has also hatched more than 200,000 ducklings to supply other areas.

    金定鸭产蛋多
    据新华社福州31日电  福建省龙溪县紫泥公社金定生产大队的五千六百多只母鸭，从去年2月到今年2月，平均年产蛋量二百八十五个。其中有二百四十只良种母鸭平均年产蛋达三百四十五个。
    金定大队提高母鸭产蛋量的主要经验是：增加放养时间；在昼短夜长的秋冬季节里，夜间加喂饲料，冬季水生生物减少时，增喂补充饲料或增喂骨粉等。
    金定生产大队临近江海，当地人民用水内浮游生物饲养鸭子，历来就以养鸭多、产蛋量高、鸭蛋大，质量好闻名全省。养鸭收入占全大队总收入的20％左右。目前除自己继续发展鸭子生产外，还孵化了二十多万只小鸭，供应外地。
