    Ten Years Ago Recreated Before Our Eyes: Color Film "Battle of Shanghai" Filmed Intensely
    Ten years ago, in May, the Chinese People's Liberation Army liberated Shanghai completely and flawlessly, achieving an unprecedented miracle. This heroic epic is currently being filmed by the "August First" Film Studio in Shanghai as the color feature film "Battle of Shanghai."
    A few nights ago, the intense light of mercury lamps and searchlights illuminated some streets near the Bund as if it were daytime. The crew of the "August First" Film Studio was working hard here on the filming of "Battle of Shanghai."
    One day, the area of Hankou Road and Fuzhou Road was ablaze with lights. The crossroads on the road became a temporary film set, where several shots of capturing Chiang bandit prisoners were being filmed. In the chaos of battle, an enemy jeep crashed into our army's position. Our soldiers stepped forward and shouted, "Stop!" The enemy major leaned out of the car window and cursed, "Get out, get out of my way!" A soldier stepped forward, grabbed the enemy major, and told him, "You've arrived at your stop." The enemy suddenly realized that he had been captured.
    One day, the Shanghai Zhabei Power Plant near Wusong Town suddenly replaced its sign with the old sign of the Shanghai Zhabei Electric Power Company from ten years ago. A grass-green tank was parked outside the factory gate. It turned out that another shot of "Battle of Shanghai" was being filmed here. This shot depicts the situation on May 25, 1949, when the bandit leader Tang Enbo attempted to destroy the factories on the north bank of the Suzhou River before fleeing. When filming began, the tank violently smashed through the factory's iron gate, immediately igniting the flames of anger in the hearts of the workers. The bandit company commander roared, "I am ordered to blow up the power plant. Those who want to live, leave quickly!" The workers immediately uttered a firm voice and shouted, "The factory is our lifeline. We will never leave." Among the workers participating in the filming was a worker named Han Zhenfu, who participated in this struggle back then. Ten years ago, he was a coal porter; today, he has become a skilled electrical worker. He said with a look full of excitement and pride: "Ten years have passed. The factory that the enemy tried to destroy back then has now expanded six or seven times, and the generators are also manufactured by ourselves."

    十年前的情景再现眼前  彩色片“战上海”紧张拍摄
    十年前的5月里，中国人民解放军以史无前例的奇迹，完整无缺地解放了上海。这部英雄史诗，目前正由“八一”电影制片厂在上海摄制成彩色故事片“战上海”。
    前几天夜里，强烈的水银灯和探照灯光照耀得外滩附近一些街道如同白昼，“八一”电影制片厂的摄制人员正在这里紧张地进行“战上海”的拍摄工作。
    一天，汉口路福州路一带，已是万家灯火。马路上的十字街头变成了临时摄影场，在这里拍摄的是活捉蒋匪俘虏的几个镜头。在混乱的战斗中，敌人的一辆吉普车闯进了我军阵地，我军战士上前喊令站住！敌少校从车窗探头大骂：“滚蛋，给我滚开。”战士上去一把揪下敌少校，告诉他：“你到站了。”敌人恍然大悟，这时才知道自己被俘虏了。
    一天，吴淞镇附近的上海闸北发电厂突然换上了十年前商办闸北水电公司的老招牌，厂门外停放着一辆草绿色的坦克车。原来，“战上海”的又一个镜头在这里开拍了。这个镜头是描写1949年5月25日匪首汤恩伯临逃前企图炸毁苏州河北岸工厂的情况。拍摄开始时，坦克车猛力地撞毁了工厂的铁门，工人们心里立即燃起了愤怒的火焰。匪连长吼叫着“本人奉命要炸毁发电厂，要活命的快离开”。工人们顿时一齐发出坚决的声音，高呼：“工厂是我们的命根子，我们决不离开。”在参加拍摄的工人队伍中，有一位名叫韩振福的工人，当年参加了这个斗争。十年前他是一个扛炭的工人，今天已经成为一个有技术的电气工人了。他充满着激动和自豪的神情说：“十年过去了，当年敌人企图炸毁的这个工厂，现在已经扩大了六、七倍，发电机也由自己制造了。”
