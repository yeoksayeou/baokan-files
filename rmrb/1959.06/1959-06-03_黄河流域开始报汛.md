Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, June 2nd: The flood season reporting work in the Yellow River Basin began comprehensively on June 1st.

This year, the Yellow River's flood control work started one month earlier than in previous years. More than 300 hydrological, water level, rainfall and other monitoring stations are participating in the flood season reporting throughout the basin, an increase of more than 50 compared to last year. The deployment line of these hydrological and meteorological stations has also been extended by more than 100 li compared to previous years. In the past, their deployment line started from Guide in Qinghai Province and extended to Qianzuo and No. 4 pile at the estuary in Shandong Province. This year, the upstream has been extended to Tangnaihai in Xinghai County, 171 kilometers away from Guide.

In order to do a good job in this year's flood control work, the Yellow River Conservancy Commission held a water situation work conference in Zhengzhou on June 1st to specifically study issues related to flood season reporting. Recently, it will also hold a seminar on flood forecasting technology for the Sanmenxia Reservoir in Sanmenxia. Prior to this, the Yellow River Conservancy Commission also trained more than 100 flood forecasting technicians, expanding the ranks of forecasting work.

    黄河流域开始报汛
    新华社郑州2日电　黄河流域的报汛工作在6月1日全面开始。
    今年黄河的防汛工作比往年提前了一个月，全流域参加报汛的水文、水位、雨量等测站有三百多个，比去年增加五十多个。这些水文、气象测站的设置线也比往年延伸了一百多里。过去，它们的设置线是上起青海省的贵德，下至山东省入海处的前左和四号桩。今年上游已延伸到离贵德一百七十一公里的兴海县唐乃亥了。
    为了做好今年的防汛工作，黄河水利委员会1日在郑州召开了水情工作会议，专门研究报汛工作的有关问题。最近并将在三门峡召开三门峡水库洪水预报技术座谈会。在这以前，黄河水利委员会还训练了一百多名洪水预报技术员，扩大了预报工作的队伍。
