Lin'an's Local Fertilizer Production Sees New Development in Grasping Quantity and Quality

Hangzhou, June 23 (This newspaper) – On the basis of the great development of local fertilizer production in Lin'an County, Zhejiang Province in 1958, the county continues to vigorously promote the production of local fertilizers and refined local miscellaneous fertilizers. At present, the county has produced 630,000 dan of the above two kinds of fertilizers, of which 210,000 dan have been used for spring crops, and the rest have been applied to early rice fields, with an average of 210 jin per mu. Calculated at a conversion rate of 17 jin to 1 jin of ammonium superphosphate, each mu has been applied with the equivalent of 12 jin of ammonium superphosphate. The county has decided to produce 3.7 million dan of the above two kinds of fertilizers before the end of October to ensure the realization of this year's agricultural production plan.

Lin'an County is one of the advanced regions in the country for local fertilizer production. This year, in March, according to the principle of combining indigenous and foreign methods, and combining mass production with professional factory production, the county merged more than 10,000 temporary small local fertilizer factories into 872 factories, which are led by production teams, management areas, communes, and the county, respectively.

At present, the local fertilizers and refined local miscellaneous fertilizers produced in large quantities in Lin'an County include: peat nitrogen fertilizer and lignite nitrogen fertilizer, which use peat or lignite as the main raw material, mixed with turf and leaves for composting and fermentation; ammonia water recovered from chimneys or burnt clay ash; phosphate rock powder compost, which uses phosphate rock as the main raw material; and potassium-calcium mixed fertilizer, which uses potash feldspar as the raw material. Among them, recovering ammonia water when burning coke clay ash is a simple and easy method with high fertilizer quality. The "ammonium bicarbonate" produced in this way has a fertilizer effect equivalent to 2.5 dan of human manure per dan. The national on-site meeting on fertilizer accumulation and production held in Lin'an County last year highly praised this method.

In order to continuously improve the quality of local fertilizers, all permanent factories in Lin'an County have laboratories and local fertilizer efficacy test fields. The factories adopt a three-way combination of leaders, technicians, and workers to continuously study the product's ingredients and technical operations.

The fundamental reason why Lin'an County's local fertilizer production is so successful is that the county party committee is very determined to carry out this work and has taken effective measures in all aspects. The county's scientific research institute and geological survey team have both made local fertilizer production their central task. After last year's mass movement to vigorously develop local fertilizer production, the county has trained nearly 300 technical personnel in local fertilizer manufacturing. The county has discovered twelve peat resources, five phosphate mines, and potash feldspar mines with a high potassium content, with reserves of 48 million tons. These abundant fertilizer resources provide a reliable material guarantee for the great development of local fertilizer production in Lin'an County in the future.

### 抓数量  抓质量  临安土化肥生产有新发展

    抓数量  抓质量
    临安土化肥生产有新发展
    本报杭州23日电　浙江临安县在1958年土制化肥生产大发展的基础上，继续大搞土制化肥和精制土杂肥生产。目前全县已生产以上两种肥料六十三万担，其中除二十一万担已用于春花作物外，其余全部施入早稻田，平均每亩二百一十斤。按十七斤折肥田粉一斤计算，每亩施了相当于十二斤肥田粉的肥效。这个县决定在10月底以前生产以上两种肥料三百七十万担，以保证实现今年的农业生产计划。
    临安县是全国土化肥生产的先进地区之一。这个县在今年3月，根据土洋并举，群众性生产与专业厂生产相结合的方针，将去年全县一万多个临时性的小型土化肥工场合并为八百七十二个工厂，分别由生产队、管理区、公社和县领导。
    目前，临安县大量生产的土化肥和精制土杂肥有：以泥炭或石煤作为主要原料，渗合草皮、树叶进行堆制发酵的泥炭氮肥和石煤氮肥，从烟囱或烧焦泥灰回收氨水，以磷矿石为主要原料的磷矿粉堆肥以及用钾长石为原料的钾钙混合肥料等。其中，在烧制焦泥灰时回收氨水，是一种简单易行，所得肥料质量很高的好方法，所制成的“碳酸氢铵”，每担的肥效相当于二担半人粪尿。去年在临安县召开的全国积肥造肥现场会议对这种方法评价很高。
    为了使土制化肥的质量不断提高，临安各常年生产的工厂都设有化验室和土化肥肥效试验田。各厂采用领导、技术员和工人群众三结合的方式，经常不断地对产品的配料、技术操作进行研究。
    临安县的土化肥生产搞得好，最根本的原因是县委对这项工作的决心很大，并且从各方面采取了有效的措施。县科学研究所和地质勘测队都把土化肥生产作为自己的中心任务。经过去年大搞土化肥的群众运动，全县培养出将近三百个土化肥制造的技术人员。全县已发现泥炭资源十二处，磷矿五处，还有含钾量很高的钾长石矿，蕴藏量达四千八百万吨。这些丰富的肥料资源，给临安县今后土化肥生产的大发展，提供了可靠的物质保证。
