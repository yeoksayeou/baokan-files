    Yangtze River Freight Rate Adjustment

    (Our dispatch) The State Council has approved the Yangtze River freight rate adjustment plan, which will be implemented starting June 1st. Over the past eight years, Yangtze River freight rates have been reduced several times, but they are still relatively high compared to railway rates. Moreover, the segmented pricing for the upper, middle, and lower reaches is complex, which affects rational transportation.

    In addition to an average reduction of 15.2% across the entire Yangtze River line, the new freight rates also include a significant reduction in long-distance freight rates. For example, Yichang to Chongqing is reduced by 36.7%, Hankou to Chongqing is reduced by 36.7%, and Shanghai to Chongqing is reduced by 29.5%. This makes long-distance freight rates lower than railway freight rates. For example, rice from Chongqing to Shanghai is 39.8% cheaper than the direct railway freight rate, and fertilizer is 12.7% cheaper. At the same time, special prices have been abolished, the method of segmented pricing has been changed, and the freight rates for the upper, middle, and lower reaches have been unified.

    While reducing long-distance freight rates, reasonable adjustments have also been made to short-distance freight rates. Due to the current low short-distance freight rates, local shipping companies are experiencing certain difficulties in their operations. In order to resolve the contradiction of excessive differences with local freight rates, the new freight rates have also been slightly increased. For example, the freight rate from Hankou to Yichang has increased by 8.6%.

    长江货运调整运价
    本报讯　长江货运调整运价方案业经国务院批准，在6月1日起实行。八年来，长江货运运价曾有多次降低，但与铁路比较，仍然偏高，而且上、中、下游分段定价，计算复杂，因而影响合理运输。
    新运价除了长江全线平均降低15.2％以外，对长途运价也有较大幅度的降低。如宜昌到重庆降低了36.7％，汉口到重庆降低了36.7％，上海到重庆降低了29.5％。这样，长途运价就低于铁路运价，如重庆到上海的大米比铁路直达运价低39.8％，肥田粉低12.7％。同时，取消了特价，改变了分段计价的方法，统一了上中下游运价。
    在降低长途运价的同时，对短途运价也作了合理的调整。由于现行短途运价过低，地方航运企业的经营有一定困难。为了解决与地方运价差距过大的矛盾，新运价也作了稍许的提高。例如从汉口到宜昌的运价，提高了8.6％。
