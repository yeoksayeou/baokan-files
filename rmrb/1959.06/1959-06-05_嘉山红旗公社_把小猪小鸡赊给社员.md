Jiashan Hongqi Commune
Sells Piglets and Chicks to Commune Members on Credit

(Hefei News) The Hongqi Commune in Jiashan County, Anhui Province, is implementing the policy of "equal emphasis on public and private raising," and the development of poultry and livestock is very rapid.

When reporters recently visited this commune, they saw chickens in flocks and pigs in pens in every village. This commune, with 1,835 households and 7,015 people, has raised more than 50,000 chickens, an average of seven per person; each household has an average of one pig. Other animals such as geese, ducks, cattle, and sheep have also increased.

In order to help commune members solve the difficulty of lacking young livestock and poultry, the commune party committee built a chicken hatchery and incubated large quantities of chicks. Batches of newly hatched chicks were sold to commune members on credit, and the number of chickens raised in the entire commune quickly exceeded previous years. The first batch of chicks out of the nest now generally weigh three or four taels. The commune also strengthened the leadership of the pig farms, requiring that sows not be left empty so as to quickly satisfy the ability of each commune member household to raise pigs. At present, the commune has sold nearly 300 piglets to commune members on credit, and more than 300 piglets will be available for commune members to raise after weaning.

With young poultry and livestock, the commune also vigorously assisted commune members in solving the difficulty of feed. While advocating the collection of wild feed, a portion of feed land was left for each household, and commune members were encouraged to use the front and back of their houses and the corners of fields to plant feed crops such as melons and vegetables.

While helping commune members develop poultry and livestock, the commune also correspondingly developed the number of collectively raised animals. For example, the commune focused on raising sows to lay a good foundation for further development of pigs in the future. The chicken farm also plans to expand the number of chickens to 10,000 for the purpose of supplying the market and breeding improved varieties. The sheep farm will also breed another 950 lambs.

    嘉山红旗公社
    把小猪小鸡赊给社员
    本报合肥讯　安徽省嘉山县红旗公社实行“公养和私养并重”的方针，家禽家畜发展很快。
    记者最近访问这个公社时，只见村村鸡成群、猪满圈。这个有一千八百三十五户、七千零十五人的公社，已养鸡五万多只，平均每人有七只；生猪每户平均一头。其他如鹅、鸭和牛、羊，也有了增加。
    公社党委为帮助社员解决幼畜、幼禽缺乏的困难，建起了孵鸡厂，大量炕孵，把一批批新孵出的小鸡赊销给社员，全社养鸡的数量很快就超过了往年。第一批出窝的小鸡，现在已普遍有三四两重了。公社还加强了对养猪场的领导，要求做到母猪不空怀，以便迅速满足社员户户能养猪。现在公社已赊给社员小猪近三百头，还有三百多头小猪断奶后即可供给社员喂养。
    有了幼禽幼畜，公社还大力协助社员解决饲料困难。在提倡采集野生饲料的同时，给每户留一部分饲料地，鼓励社员利用家前屋后、田头地角种植瓜菜等饲料作物。
    这个公社一面帮助社员发展家禽家畜，一面还相应地发展了集体饲养的数量，如公社着重大养母猪，作为今后进一步发展生猪打好基础。养鸡场也打算把鸡的数量扩大到一万只，作为供应市场和繁殖良种之用。羊场也将再繁殖小羊九百五十头。
