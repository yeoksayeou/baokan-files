Bucharest, June 10th (report from our newspaper) – In Romania, state-owned farms and machine tractor stations are universally promoting the working methods of comprehensive mechanical production teams and tractor teams stationed long-term in collective farms in the organization of tractor team production this year. Last year's experience showed that the adoption of these two working methods can produce good promotion effect on improving production and improving work.

The comprehensive mechanical production team of the state-owned farm generally consists of five to eight tractor drivers. The difference between it and the ordinary tractor team in production is that it works on fixed plots and is responsible for everything from cultivation to harvest. The production team also adopts a division of labor and responsibility system, and each tractor driver must complete a certain work quota. The production team can get a certain bonus when it overfulfills the production plan. At the same time, they are responsible for repairing the agricultural machinery they use, which reduces repair costs, reduces the cost of agricultural products, and also promotes production. For example, the grain yield per hectare of land cultivated by the comprehensive mechanical production team of the "Guerrilla" state-owned farm in Bucharest last year was 200 kilograms more than that of ordinary tractor teams, and the production cost was also reduced by 10%.

Last year, there were a total of 800 comprehensive mechanical production teams in Romania's state-owned farms. A large-scale promotion has begun this year, and by 1960, all state-owned farms in the country will adopt the working methods of this type of production team.

At present, many tractor teams of Romanian machine tractor stations have been stationed in nearby collective farms for a long time. This can avoid the round trip from the tractor station to the collective farm, saving fuel, reducing machine wear and tear, and saving time. As a result of the promotion of this type of tractor team, the machine tractor stations in Constanta Prefecture saved a total of 28 million lei (Romanian currency) last year. Because the members of the long-term tractor team serve a fixed collective farm and also obtain the identity of the collective farm members, they are very concerned about the quality of cultivation and the improvement of production. At present, the number of long-term tractor teams in the country is constantly increasing, and the tractor teams of some machine tractor stations have all been stationed in collective farms.

    综合机械生产队固定地段负责到底
    机器拖拉机站派队长期驻集体农庄
    罗普遍推广机耕工作新方式
    本报布加勒斯特10日电　罗马尼亚的国营农场和机器拖拉机站在组织拖拉机队的生产方面，今年分别普遍推广综合机械生产队和长驻农庄的拖拉机队的工作方式。去年的经验表明，采用这两种工作方式，对提高生产和改进工作能够产生良好的促进作用。
    国营农场的综合机械生产队一般由五到八名拖拉机手组成。它在生产上和普通拖拉机队不同的是，它在固定的地段上工作，从耕种到收获负责到底。生产队内部也采取分工负责制，每名拖拉机手要完成一定的工作定额。生产队在超额完成生产计划时，可以得到一定的奖金。同时，他们使用的农业机器都归自己修理，这样就减少了修理费用，降低了农产品的成本，对提高生产也起了促进作用。例如，布加勒斯特州“游击队员”国营农场的综合机械生产队去年负责耕种的每公顷土地的粮食产量，比普通拖拉机队多二百公斤，生产成本也降低了10％。
    去年罗马尼亚的国营农场里共有八百个综合机械生产队，今年已开始大量推广，而到1960年，全国的国营农场都将采用这种生产队的工作方式。
    目前，罗马尼亚的机器拖拉机站已经有许多拖拉机队长期驻在附近的集体农庄。这样，可以避免由拖拉机站到集体农庄的往返过程，既节约燃料，又减少机器损耗，还可节省时间。康斯坦萨州的机器拖拉机站由于推广这种拖拉机队的结果，去年全州拖拉机站共节约了二千八百万列伊（罗币）。长驻拖拉机队的队员由于为固定的一个集体农庄服务，同时又取得了农庄庄员的身份，所以对耕作质量和提高生产非常关心。目前，全国长驻拖拉机队的数目不断增加，有的机器拖拉机站的拖拉机队已全部驻在集体农庄。（附图片）
