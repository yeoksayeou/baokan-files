    The "Residents" of Antarctica
    ——Introducing the Soviet Documentary "Story of the Penguins"
    Wu Nan
    Those who have never been to Antarctica have all sorts of fantasies about it. Soviet filmmakers stationed at the Vostok Station in Antarctica filmed a documentary about the lives of penguins, giving us the opportunity to see some of the Antarctic landscape on the screen. The explorers' ship traveled through the Indian Ocean to Antarctica, and the film begins by presenting us with boundless oceans and countless ice floes. Icebergs, drifting on the sea for many years, glitter and shine. Many strange sights are fascinating. The further south the ship goes, the colder the weather becomes.
    Penguins are unique seabirds in Antarctica, and there are many species, said to be seventeen. The filmmakers took advantage of the autumn season when the penguins came ashore in groups to live and filmed excerpts of the emperor penguin's life. Their heads, backs, wings, and tails are black, while their necks and bellies are white; they are about one meter tall, weigh about fifty kilograms, have small heads and short legs, and fat bodies; their wings are short and lack flight feathers, so they cannot fly, but in the ocean, they are agile and powerful "paddles"; their feet are at the end of their bodies, and on land, they can only stand upright to walk or slide on their bellies. They waddle as they walk, like a group of gentlemen in tuxedos, leisurely strolling there.
    Penguins have to spend the long autumn and winter ashore, during which time they find mates and incubate the next generation. In order to record this interesting period of their lives, the photographer became friends with them and selected the protagonists of the film. In the film, our protagonist, like other male penguins, is determined to choose a satisfactory partner; in the process of selection, he experiences the distress of failure, but in the end, he organizes a family. The couple is inseparable during their honeymoon, very affectionate, and participates in dances and skiing games held in the big family. Then, the difficult and arduous family life begins. It takes sixty days from laying eggs to hatching baby penguins. Because the weather is cold, the eggs will freeze if placed on the ground, so they must be placed on the back of the feet and protected with feathers. During the long sixty days, this work is shared by the husband and wife in turn.
    Unfortunately struck. In a blizzard, the female goose froze to death, and the egg cracked. The heavy blow made our protagonist very sad. The film does not end here. Then, our protagonist picks up an egg left behind by a companion who was killed, and he decides to take on the responsibilities of a parent in place of the deceased, to hatch the baby penguin, and from then on, his life has a purpose again.
    The little protagonist is finally born. Fortunately, penguins have a habit of protecting their own kind, so when our protagonist goes out to find food, he can safely entrust the child to his collective. The film depicts the life of the little protagonist in the "nursery group" and also narrates its independent life - traveling alone. The world is so big, everything makes the little protagonist feel new and interesting, and it is not even afraid of seals. These all truly show the innocence of the little penguin and the courage of a newborn calf not afraid of tigers.
    When the little penguin can live independently, it is also time for our protagonist and his companions to say goodbye to the land; they line up one after another in a single line, maintaining a very orderly formation. The whole group maintains consistent action during the journey, because the little penguins sometimes fall behind, so there is always an old penguin taking care of them from behind. Leaving the shore, they will go north to places with sunlight, to the beautiful ocean.
    The film captures the joyful, difficult, and painful experiences of penguins' lives. It can be seen that the photographer used great patience when shooting this film and put his feelings for penguins into it. Coupled with the cooperation of the editors and commentators, the film has a strong human touch and is very interesting and moving. (Picture attached)

    南极的“居民”
    ——介绍苏联纪录片“企鹅的故事”
    吴楠
    没有到过南极的人，对于南极有各种各样的幻想。苏联驻南极洲和平村的电影工作者，在那里拍摄了一部纪录企鹅生活的影片，使我们有机会从银幕上看到一些南极的风光。探险家们的船经印度洋到南极洲，影片一开始就在我们面前呈现着一望无边的汪洋和无数的冰块，长年在海面上游荡着的冰山，闪闪发光。许多稀奇的景象十分迷人。船只愈往南，天气就愈冷了。
    企鹅是南极洲特有的海鸟，它的种类很多，据说有十七种。影片作者趁那边正是秋季，企鹅成群地都到岸上来生活的时候，拍摄了皇帝种企鹅的生活片断。它们从头到背、翅膀、尾巴都是黑色的，从脖子到腹部却是白色的；身材约一公尺高，体重一般约五十公斤，头小脚短，躯体肥胖；翅膀短小没有助飞的羽毛，不能飞，但在海洋中却是一双敏捷而有力的“划桨”；脚长在躯体末端，在陆地上只能立起身子行走或用腹部滑行。它们走起路来一摇一摆，活像一群穿燕尾服的绅士，在那里悠闲地散步。
    企鹅要在岸上渡过漫长的秋季和冬季，它们在这个期间寻找配偶，孵育第二代。摄影师为了纪录下它们这一段有趣的生活，和它们交成朋友，从中选定了影片的主角。影片里我们的主人公和其他雄企鹅一样，一心想选择一个满意的伴侣；在挑选的过程中，它经历了失败的苦恼，但最后还是把家庭组织起来了。它们两口子在蜜月里形影不离，十分亲热，双双参加大家庭里举行的舞会和滑雪游戏。接着，艰难繁重的家庭生活开始了。它们从下蛋到孵出小企鹅，共要六十天。因为天气冷，蛋放在地上会冻坏，必须放在脚背上，用羽毛盖着保护起来。在漫长的六十天里，这项工作是由夫妇轮流分担完成的。
    不幸降临了。在一次暴风雪中，雌鹅冻死了，蛋也冻裂了，沉重的打击使我们的主人公十分悲痛。影片到这里并没有结束。接着，我们的主人公拾到一个遇害同伴遗留下来的蛋，它决心代替死者担负起父母的职责，把小企鹅孵出来，从此它的生活又有目的了。
    小主人公终于出世了。好在企鹅有一种保护同族的习性，所以我们的主人公出外寻找食物时，可以放心把孩子托付给自己的集体。影片描写了小主人公在“托儿组”里的生活，也叙述它独立的生活——单独外出旅行。世界是那么大，一切都使小主人公感到新颖、有趣，它甚至连海豹也不怕。这些都真实地表现了小企鹅的天真无邪，初生牛犊不畏虎的勇气。
    当小企鹅可以独立生活的时候，也是我们的主人公和同伴们要向陆地告别的时候到了；它们一个跟着一个排成单行走，保持着很严整的队伍。它们在旅行中全群都保持着一致的行动，因为小企鹅有时会掉队，所以总有一只老的企鹅在后面照管着。离开岸上，它们将到北方有阳光的地方去，到美丽的海洋中去。
    影片拍下了企鹅生活中欢乐、艰难和痛苦的经历。可以看出，摄影师在拍摄这部影片时，用了极大的耐性，把自己对企鹅的感情贯注进去了。再加上编辑、解说创作人员的合作，使影片具有浓郁的人情味，而且十分有趣和动人。（附图片）
