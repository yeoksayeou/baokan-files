Rapeseed is one of China's main oil crops.

Rapeseed is widely distributed in China, with more concentrated planting in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and in the southwestern provinces of Yunnan and Guizhou.

Rapeseed is divided into two types: winter-sown and spring-sown. The area south of the Yellow River is the winter rapeseed production area, while the provinces and regions of Inner Mongolia, Qinghai, Xinjiang, Gansu, and Ningxia are the spring rapeseed production areas.

The rapeseed being harvested now in various regions is all winter rapeseed. Spring rapeseed matures mostly around September. The ratio of winter rapeseed to spring rapeseed sown in China is roughly 10:1.

Rapeseed has high economic value. The seeds can be pressed for oil, which can be used for edible purposes or as an industrial raw material. The oil cake left after pressing oil is both a fertilizer and feed. Rapeseed stalks and rapeseed husks also have uses. According to experiments in Sichuan, one hundred jin of rapeseed stalks can yield six and a half jin of fine velvet hemp; one hundred jin of rapeseed pods and husks can be made into fifty to fifty-five jin of pig feed powder.

    油菜
    油菜是我国主要油料作物。
    我国油菜分布很广，长江中、下游各省和西南云南、贵州等省种植比较集中。
    油菜分冬播、春播两种。黄河流域以南的地区是冬油菜产区，内蒙古、青海、新疆、甘肃、宁夏等省区是春油菜产区。
    各地现在收割的都是冬油菜。春油菜成熟多在9月份前后。我国播种的冬油菜和春油菜的比例，大体上是：10∶1。
    油菜的经济价值很高。菜籽可榨油，油可食用，也能作工业原料。榨油剩下的油饼是肥料也是饲料。油菜秆和油菜壳也都有用。据四川试验，一百斤油菜秆可出细绒麻六斤半；一百斤油菜荚壳可制出猪饲料粉末五十到五十五斤。（附图片）
