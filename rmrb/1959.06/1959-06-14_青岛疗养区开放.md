Xinhua News Agency, Qingdao, June 13th. As the height of summer approaches, the Qingdao Sanatorium Area, after active preparations, has begun to welcome guests.

The Qingdao Sanatorium Area is located in the southeast suburbs of Qingdao. Surrounded by mountains and facing the sea, the air is cool and humid, with no severe cold in winter and no intense heat in summer. It is one of China's famous sanatorium areas. There are currently nine sanatoriums. The newly built Hot Spring Sanatorium last year has natural underground mineral springs. The spring water temperature is as high as 95 degrees Celsius, and it has a good effect on treating rheumatoid arthritis, chronic arthritis, and so on. Many sanatoriums used to focus on recuperation, but now they have developed into focusing on treatment. The entire area currently has more than 2,270 beds, and the medical equipment is relatively complete.

In order to welcome the arrival of guests this summer, the Qingdao Sanatorium Area had made full preparations in advance. For example, increasing the number of beds, painting the rest buildings, and repairing and beautifying the gardens and street environment of the sanatorium area, etc. Both sides of the newly built roads are now planted with weeping willows and flowering peach trees; most of the rest buildings have gardens and flowers. After greening and renovation, the entire area is green and vibrant, with a myriad of sights.

Since the beginning of June, a small number of guests have come to Qingdao. A large number of guests will also arrive one after another in the next few days.

    青岛疗养区开放
    新华社青岛13日电  盛夏将临，青岛疗养区经过积极筹备，开始迎接客人。
    青岛疗养区在青岛市东南郊，环山临海，空气凉爽湿润，冬无严寒，夏无酷暑，是我国著名的疗养区之一。现有疗养院九处。去年新建的温泉疗养院，有天然的地下矿泉，泉水温度高达九十五度，对治疗风湿性关节炎、慢性关节炎等，都有很好的疗效。不少疗养院原来以疗养为主，现在已发展成为以治疗为主。全区现有床位二千二百七十多张，医疗设备也比较齐全。
    为了迎接今夏客人的到来，青岛疗养区事先曾作了充分的准备。例如增加了床位，粉刷了休养楼，修整和美化了疗养区的园林和街道环境等。新修马路两旁，现在都栽有碧桃垂柳；大部分休养楼旁都设有园圃花木。经过绿化修整，全区青新碧绿，景象万千。
    进入6月以来，已有少数客人来到青岛。大批客人今后几天内也将陆续来到。
