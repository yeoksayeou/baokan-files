Xinhua News Agency, June 11th dispatch from Geneva: The Foreign Ministers' meeting of Eastern and Western countries was held formally on the 10th, presided over by French Foreign Minister De Murville.

    The first to speak at the meeting was Gromyko.

    In his speech, Gromyko stated the new proposals put forward by the Soviet government on the issues under discussion at the meeting. He pointed out that although the Soviet Union had taken the views of Western countries into account in some important aspects when discussing the Berlin issue and the peace treaty issue, the Western countries had not shown willingness to substantively discuss the clauses of the draft peace treaty proposed by the Soviet government and the proposals on granting West Berlin the status of a demilitarized free city.

    Gromyko then emphasized that the Soviet government was continuing to strive for a mutually acceptable solution on the West Berlin issue and the German peace treaty issue. He said: "In order to promote the success of our negotiations, the Soviet government has taken another important step in this regard. The new proposal of the Soviet government, which has already been agreed to by the government of the German Democratic Republic, is now submitted to the meeting for discussion."

    Gromyko's proposal was:

    The Soviet Union, taking into account the position of the Western countries, is prepared not to insist on the immediate and complete abolition of the occupation regime in West Berlin. The Soviet government can agree to the temporary retention of certain occupation rights in West Berlin by the Western countries, but with one condition: this state can only be maintained for a strictly defined period, that is, only for one year.

    During this period, the two Germanys must implement measures related to the establishment of an All-German Committee, which should be composed of representatives from the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany based on the principle of equality on a one-to-one basis.

    The committee should promote the expansion and development of contacts between the two Germanys, discuss and formulate specific measures for the reunification of Germany, and study issues related to the preparation and conclusion of a German peace treaty.

    If the proposal to establish a committee is not accepted by either Germany, then the four countries can suggest that the governments of the two Germanys choose a way of cooperation that they can accept to solve the above tasks.

    In order not to indefinitely delay the conclusion of a German peace treaty, a deadline should be set for the work of the All-German Committee or another institution—one year, during which the committee or another institution should reach a mutually agreed solution on the peace treaty issue and the issue of German reunification.

    Regarding the West Berlin issue, Gromyko's new proposal stated: As long as an agreement is reached on the following articles for a temporary solution to the West Berlin issue, it is possible to temporarily recognize certain occupation rights of the Western countries in West Berlin: (1) The Western countries reduce the number of troops and the amount of military equipment in West Berlin to a symbolic quantity. (2) Stop any propaganda hostile to the German Democratic Republic and other socialist countries from West Berlin. (3) Abolish all organizations in West Berlin that conduct espionage and subversion against the German Democratic Republic, the Soviet Union, and other socialist countries. (4) The Western countries guarantee not to install atomic devices and rocket devices in West Berlin.

    If the above agreement is concluded, the Soviet Union is prepared to maintain West Berlin's contact with the outside world, as it is now.

    This agreement, including the issue of maintaining West Berlin's contact with the outside world, will be the temporary regulation for West Berlin. This regulation can be guaranteed in this way: first, by the four countries on the basis of the protocol on guarantees put forward by the Soviet delegation; second, by the government of the German Democratic Republic, which in principle agrees to respect the agreed temporary regulations for West Berlin.

    If an agreement is reached on the issue of granting West Berlin the status of a demilitarized free city according to the suggestions previously put forward by the Soviet government, then the guarantee of unimpeded contact between the free city and the outside world can be maintained until Germany is unified.

    In order to supervise the implementation of the obligations undertaken by all parties under the agreement on the temporary status of West Berlin, the Soviet government proposes to establish a supervisory body composed of representatives of the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and France. This body should supervise West Berlin to ensure that the agreement on the above issues is not violated, and take corresponding measures to ensure the implementation of the agreement on the temporary status, without prejudice to the sovereignty of the German Democratic Republic.

    Gromyko said that the Soviet delegation must state that if the Western countries do not take the above-mentioned minimum measures in West Berlin during the one-year transition period, then the Soviet Union will also not agree to the continuation of the occupation regime in West Berlin. If the Western countries or the West German government obstruct a mutually agreed solution on the issue of concluding a peace treaty within the above-mentioned time limit, then the Soviet Union will have no choice but to conclude a peace treaty with the German Democratic Republic together with other relevant countries that fought against Germany.

    After Gromyko's speech, the head of the US delegation, Herter, spoke. He said that the new Soviet proposal was unacceptable to the US delegation and could not be used as a basis for discussion, even though the US delegation had not yet studied it.

    Herter tried to justify his hasty conclusion. He indicated that the US delegation still insisted on maintaining the occupation regime in West Berlin, even though this occupation regime was long outdated and had begun to become a constant source of international tension.

    It can be seen from the Soviet Union's new proposals regarding West Berlin and the All-German Committee that these proposals stemmed from the desire of the Soviet delegation to seek a solution that could be accepted by all parties. Nevertheless, Herter futilely insisted that the Soviet delegation's proposals were an attempt to exert some kind of pressure on the Western delegations.

    Herter once again acknowledged that the situation in West Berlin was abnormal. However, he did not offer any constructive suggestions.

    In closing his speech, Herter stated that he was willing to continue negotiations and work together to reach an agreement to pave the way for the summit conference of heads of government.

    British Foreign Secretary Lloyd, in a brief speech, generally agreed with Herter's views on the new Soviet proposal. At the same time, he expressed his firm belief that as long as both sides were sincere, there might be room for reaching an agreement. He expressed the hope that the negotiations would make progress and achieve some success.

    Lloyd finally said that at future meetings, he would express his opinions on some of the issues raised by Gromyko in his statement.

    The next speaker was the Foreign Minister of the German Democratic Republic, Bolz. He once again emphasized that the reunification of Germany was primarily a matter for the two Germanys. He said that starting from this principle, the government of the German Democratic Republic had for many years not only suggested negotiations between the two Germanys, but also proposed the establishment of an all-German body. However, the government of the Federal Republic of Germany, regardless of the will of the German people, had consistently failed to consider these suggestions.

    Speaking of the Soviet delegation's proposal for an All-German Committee, Bolz pointed out that these proposals were in line with the proposals of the government of the German Democratic Republic. At the same time, if the meeting endorsed equal negotiations between the two Germanys in accordance with these proposals, it would help the German people solve their own important problems.

    The Foreign Minister of the German Democratic Republic said that the meeting could determine in principle that in order to conclude a German peace treaty and reunify Germany, it was necessary to conduct equal negotiations between the two Germanys; and that the establishment of an all-German body, such as the All-German Committee, was beneficial. If the meeting made such a statement, it would mean that the four powers respected and recognized that the two Germanys had reached an agreement on the issue of their mutual relations and the issue of reunification. The German Democratic Republic is prepared to negotiate with the Federal Republic of Germany and hopes to achieve mutual understanding in these negotiations.

    Bolz emphasized that the establishment of the proposed all-German body must strictly adhere to the principle of cooperation between countries on the basis of respect for sovereign equality under international law. When talking about the period of activity of the all-German body, Bolz pointed out that this period should not exceed one year, because there is a danger of delaying negotiations and continuing atomic arming of West Germany.

    Bolz then talked about the West Berlin issue. He said that the German Democratic Republic agreed with the Soviet delegation's proposal regarding the temporary status of West Berlin. He emphasized that this proposal would establish the preconditions for easing tensions in Berlin and would promote the easing of international tensions. Bolz also pointed out that only the conclusion of a German peace treaty would make it possible to completely resolve the West Berlin issue.

    After Bolz spoke, De Murville spoke next. He expressed "disappointment" with Gromyko's speech. He expressed dissatisfaction that the Soviet proposal mentioned the establishment of an All-German Committee. In fact, it is well known that the establishment of such a committee was proposed by the Western countries themselves. De Murville insisted that the Soviet delegation intended to have the All-German Committee carry out its activities on the basis of the Soviet government's proposal.

    De Murville expressed his agreement with the speech made by Herter on the new Soviet proposal. He said that the French delegation would have to reconsider these proposals and consider the situation that these proposals had created for the meeting.

    Then, Gromyko briefly commented on the speeches of the foreign ministers of the three Western countries.

    Finally, Grewe spoke at the meeting. He put forward some preliminary opinions on behalf of the delegation of the government of the Federal Republic of Germany. In these opinions, he generally agreed with the speeches made by the representatives of the United States, Britain and France on the new Soviet proposal. Grewe said that the delegation of the Federal Republic of Germany would study these proposals.

    The meeting then adjourned. The next formal meeting is scheduled for June 12.

### 为促使外长会议达成协议再作重要努力  苏联建议一年后完全结束西柏林占领  西方外长悍然拒绝苏联建议图谋永久霸占西柏林

    为促使外长会议达成协议再作重要努力
    苏联建议一年后完全结束西柏林占领
    西方外长悍然拒绝苏联建议图谋永久霸占西柏林
    新华社11日讯　据塔斯社日内瓦讯：东西方国家外长会议10日在法国外长德姆维尔主持下举行正式会议。
    在会上第一个发言的是葛罗米柯。
    葛罗米柯在发言中陈述了苏联政府对会议讨论的问题提出的新建议。他指出，尽管在讨论柏林问题和讨论和约问题的时候苏联都在一些重要方面照顾到了西方国家的观点，然而西方国家没有表示愿意从实质上讨论苏联政府提出的和约草案的条款和关于给西柏林非军事化自由城市地位的建议。
    葛罗米柯接着强调说，苏联政府在继续努力争取就西柏林问题和对德和约问题取得互相可以接受的解决办法。他说：为了促使我们谈判成功，苏联政府在这方面又迈出了重要的一步。现在把已经获得德意志民主共和国政府同意的苏联政府的新建议提交会议讨论。
    葛罗米柯提出的建议是：
    苏联，考虑到西方国家的立场，准备不坚持立即完全取消西柏林的占领制度。苏联政府可以同意西方国家在西柏林暂时保留某些占领权利，但是有一个条件：这种状态只能保持一个严格规定的时期，即只能保持一年。
    在这段时期内，两个德国必须实行同建立全德委员会有关的措施，这个委员会应由德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国根据一对一的平等原则派代表组成。
    委员会应当促使扩大和发展两个德国之间的接触，讨论并拟订统一德国的具体措施，以及研究同准备和缔结对德和约有关的问题。
    如果建立委员会的建议不被这个德国或那个德国所接受，那么四国可以建议两个德国的政府选择它们所能接受的、为解决上述任务而实行合作的方式。
    为了不致无限期地拖延对德和约的缔结，应当为全德委员会或一个别的机构的工作规定一个期限——一年，在这一年内，委员会或一个别的机构应当就和约问题和统一德国问题取得一致同意的解决办法。
    关于西柏林问题，葛罗米柯提出的新建议说：只要根据下列各条达成暂时解决西柏林问题的协议，暂时承认西方国家在西柏林的某些占领权利是可以的：（1）西方国家把自己在西柏林的军队人数和军备数量缩减到象征性的数量。（2）停止从西柏林发出任何敌视德意志民主共和国和其他社会主义国家的宣传。（3）取消设在西柏林的、对德意志民主共和国、苏联和其他社会主义国家进行间谍活动和颠复活动的一切组织。（4）西方国家保证不在西柏林设置原子装置和火箭装置。
    如果缔结了上述协定，苏联准备维持西柏林同外界的联系，如同现在一样。
    包括维持西柏林同外界联系问题在内的这个协定将是西柏林的临时法规。这个法规可以这样加以保证：第一、由四国在苏联代表团提出的关于保证的议定书的基础上加以保证，第二、由德意志民主共和国政府加以保证，它原则上同意尊重大家协议的西柏林临时法规。
  如果根据苏联政府过去提出的建议，在给予西柏林以非军事化自由城市地位问题上达成了协议，那么，对自由城市同外界畅通无阻的联系的保证可以一直维持到德国统一时为止。
    为了监督各方根据西柏林临时地位协定而承担的义务的履行情况，苏联政府建议建立由美、苏、英、法四国代表组成的监督机构。这个机构应该监督西柏林不得破坏上述问题的协议，并采取相应的措施，保证履行临时地位的协定，同时不得损及德意志民主共和国的主权。
    葛罗米柯说，苏联代表团必须声明，如果西方国家在一年的过渡时期中，对西柏林不采取上述最低限度的措施，那末，苏联也将不会同意西柏林占领制度的继续。如果西方国家或者是西德政府阻挠在上述期限内就缔结和约问题取得一致同意的解决办法，那末，苏联将不得不同对德作战的其他有关国家一起，同德意志民主共和国缔结和约。
    葛罗米柯发言后，美国代表团团长赫脱发言。他说，苏联的新建议是美国代表团所不能接受的，不能作为讨论的基础，虽然美国代表团还没研究它。
    赫脱力图给自己匆忙所下的结论辩解。他表明，美国代表团仍然坚持维持西柏林的占领制度，虽然这个占领制度是早已过了时的，已开始成为经常产生国际紧张局势的根源。
    从苏联关于西柏林和全德委员会的新建议可以看出，这些建议是出于这样的愿望，即，苏联代表团希望求得可以为各方接受的解决办法。虽然如此，赫脱却枉费心机地硬说，苏联代表团的建议是企图给西方国家代表团施加某种压力。
    赫脱再一次承认，西柏林的局势是不正常的。但是，他没有提出任何建设性的建议。
    赫脱在结束发言时表示，他准备继续进行谈判，共同努力达成一个协议，为政府首脑会议铺平道路。
    英国外交大臣劳埃德在简短的发言中，总的表示同意赫脱对苏联新建议的意见。同时，他表示坚信，只要双方都有诚意，就可能有达成协议的余地。他表示希望谈判有所进展，并且获得某种成就。
    劳埃德最后说，在以后的会议上，他将对葛罗米柯在声明中所提出的一些问题，表示自己的意见。
    接着发言的是德意志民主共和国外交部长博尔茨。他再一次强调指出，德国的重新统一首先是两个德国的事情。他说，从这个原则出发，德意志民主共和国政府在很多年以来不仅建议两个德国之间进行谈判，而且还提出建立全德机构。但是，德意志联邦共和国政府不顾德国人民的意志，一直对这些建议不加以考虑。
    博尔茨在谈到苏联代表团提出的关于全德委员会的建议时指出，这些建议和德意志民主共和国政府的建议是相符合的，同时，如果会议依照这些建议赞同在两个德国之间举行平等的谈判的话，那么，它将有助于德国人民解决切身的重要问题。
    德意志民主共和国外交部长说，会议可以在原则上确定：为了缔结对德和约和重新统一德国，必须在两个德国之间进行平等的谈判；建立全德机构，例如全德委员会，是有益的。如果会议作出这种表示，那将意味着四大国尊重并承认两个德国就它们之间的相互关系问题以及重新统一问题达成协议。德意志民主共和国准备和德意志联邦共和国进行谈判，并希望在这些谈判中取得相互间的谅解。
    博尔茨强调指出，所提出的全德机构的建立必须严格遵守国际法中国与国之间在尊重主权平等的基础上进行合作的原则。博尔茨在谈到全德机构活动的时期时指出，这个时期不应当超过一年，因为存在着拖延谈判以及继续对西德进行原子武装的危险。
    博尔茨接着谈到西柏林问题。他说，德意志民主共和国同意苏联代表团提出的关于西柏林临时地位的建议。他强调指出，这个建议将为缓和柏林紧张局势建立前提，并会促使国际紧张局势的缓和。博尔茨同时指出，只有缔结对德和约才有可能彻底解决西柏林问题。
    博尔茨发言后，德姆维尔接着发言。他对葛罗米柯的发言表示“失望”。他表示不满的是，在苏联的建议中谈到了关于建立全德委员会。其实，人所共知，建立这种委员会是西方国家自己提出的。德姆维尔硬说，苏联代表团打算使全德委员会在苏联政府建议的基础上来开展自己的活动。
    德姆维尔表示同意赫脱就苏联的新建议所作的发言。他说，法国代表团还要再考虑这些建议，并且考虑由于这些建议而对会议产生的状况。
    然后，葛罗米柯就西方三国外长的发言扼要地提出了意见。
    最后，格雷韦在会上发言。他代表德意志联邦共和国政府代表团提出一些初步意见。在这些意见中，他一般都同意美国、英国和法国代表就苏联新建议所作的发言。格雷韦说，德意志联邦共和国代表团将对这些建议进行研究。
    会议到此结束。下次正式会议定于6月12日举行。
