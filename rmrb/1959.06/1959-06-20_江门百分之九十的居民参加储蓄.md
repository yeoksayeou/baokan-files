Jiangmen Ninety Percent of Residents Participate in Savings
Practice Thrift and Diligence in Managing Households and Save Money

(Our Dispatch) Reporter Wang Zhenhua reports: A good atmosphere of "thrift and diligence in managing households and saving money" has become common in the families of the broad masses of workers and residents in Jiangmen City, Guangdong Province. At present, more than 90% of workers and residents' families in the city have participated in savings. As of June 6th, the total amount of residents' savings in the city had reached 4,122,200 yuan, with an average of more than 240 yuan deposited per household.

In order to meet the special circumstances of some residents and facilitate deposits and withdrawals at any time, several savings offices in Jiangmen City have opened all-night savings services. Many savings staff also go deep into the neighborhoods to help residents arrange their family economic life, which is very popular with residents. For example, Zhang Ai's family, who lives at No. 10 Qilong Street, had no plan for expenses in the past. They spent too much of their wages at the beginning of the month and had to borrow money at the end of the month. Now, with the help of savings staff, they have arranged their family expenses well, not only changing the past situation of "loose at the beginning of the month and tight at the end of the month," but also achieving monthly savings.

A Special Savings Account

The Guanghe Street Savings Service Station in Xigang District, Dalian City, has a special savings account under the name of the "Jie Jian" (Thrift and Construction) Group. This savings account deposits seven or eight yuan every day at the savings service station, without interruption for five years.

This savings account is a collective savings group organized by 69 households of residents in the Fourth Group of the First Committee of Guanghe Street and surrounding neighbors to save and support national construction. Since the group was organized in 1955, each household has saved one or two jiao every day, accumulating small amounts into large sums, and has provided more than 10,000 yuan in funds to the country. In the spring of 1955, after Guanghe Street carried out propaganda among residents on building the country and managing households thriftily, Zhang Zhongjun, an elderly woman in the Fourth Group of the First Committee, said to several elderly women in the same courtyard: We have no other ability to contribute to the country, but we can still save a few jiao every day and save it to support national construction! Several families agreed at the time. Six households started to participate, each saving some change from their pocket money every day, and Zhang Zhongjun sent the money to the bank to deposit. After doing this for seven months, the six households saved 120 to 130 yuan, which benefited both the country and themselves. As a result, surrounding residents asked to participate. In this way, at the end of each year and when the savings period expired, the group could withdraw one or two thousand yuan to distribute to each household. Many households opened separate accounts to save the money they received. Now the group has 69 households. The average daily savings amount has increased to 10.30 yuan. (Zheng)

Mobile Service Delivers Money to the Door

In order to facilitate mass savings, more than 2,700 savings agencies have been established in various cities and towns in Hubei Province. Many areas have also adopted mobile service methods. The Nanjing Road Savings Office in Huangshi City has implemented telephone contact, home delivery, and night business hours to facilitate people's deposits and withdrawals.

No Need to Leave the Village to Deposit or Withdraw Money

In order to facilitate mass savings, banks and credit cooperatives in various parts of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region have universally established savings offices, agencies, and service stations in urban and rural areas. Now, even in remote Hui villages in the mountains, residents can deposit and withdraw money without leaving the village.

Extensive Establishment of Savings Organizations

In order to facilitate mass deposits and withdrawals, the Hefei City People's Bank in Anhui Province, in addition to establishing savings offices in the city, has also established agencies in various government agencies, factories, and other units, and hired employees and cadres as agents and assistant savings staff. Savings organizations have also been established among residents. (Photo attached)

### 江门百分之九十的居民参加储蓄

    江门百分之九十的居民参加储蓄
    勤俭持家节约储蓄
    本报讯　记者汪振华报道：“勤俭持家、节约储蓄”的良好风气已经在广东省江门市广大职工居民的家庭中普遍形成。目前全市已有90％以上的职工和居民家庭参加了储蓄。到6月6日止，全市居民存款金额总数已达四百一十二万二千多元，平均每户存入二百四十多元。
    为了适应一些居民的特殊情况和随时存款取款的方便，江门市几个储蓄所开办了通宵储蓄业务。不少储蓄员还深入街坊，帮助居民安排家庭经济生活，很受居民欢迎。如住在企龙街十号的张爱一家，过去开支没有计划，领到的工资在月头花得太多，到月底便要借钱。现在，在储蓄员的帮助下，已经安排好家庭开支，不但改变了过去“月头松、月尾紧”的情况，而且做到月月有余钱储蓄。
    特殊的储蓄户
    旅大市西岗区广和街储蓄服务站有一个特殊的储蓄户，户头是“节建”小组。这个储蓄户每天都到储蓄服务站存上七、八元钱，五年如一日，没有一天间断过。
    这个储蓄户就是广和街一委四组居民和周围的邻居六十九户组织起来的节约储蓄支援国家建设的集体储蓄小组。这个小组从1955年组织起来以后，每天每户储蓄一角两角钱，集零为整，日积月累，先后共给国家提供了一万多元资金。1955年春天，广和街道在居民中开展勤俭建国、勤俭持家的宣传之后，一委四组居民张忠俊老大娘对同院的几个老大娘说：咱们没有别的本事为国家出力，每天省出个角儿八分钱储蓄起来支援国家建设，还是能办得到！当时就有好几家赞成。开始有六户参加，每户每天从零用钱中省出一些零钱，张忠俊老大娘就把这几角钱送到银行存起来。这样做了七个月之后，六户居民就储蓄了一百二、三十元，对国家对自己都有好处。于是周围居民都要求参加。这样，每年年底到储蓄期满时，这个小组都能起出一两千元钱分给各户。许多户把分到手的整钱又单立了个户储蓄起来。现在这个小组已有六十九户。每天平均储蓄额已经增加到十元零三角。（政）
    流动服务送款上门
    为了便利群众储蓄，湖北省各城镇设立了二千七百多个储蓄代办所。不少地区还采取了流动服务的方式。黄石市南京路储蓄所为了群众存款取款方便，实行了电话联系、送款上门和夜间营业的办法。
    存款取款不用出村
    宁夏回族自治区各地银行和信用社，为了便利群众储蓄，在城乡普遍设立储蓄所、代办所、服务站等。现在就是在偏僻的回民山村，居民也可以存款取款不出村了。
  广泛设立储蓄组织
    安徽合肥市人民银行为了便利群众存款取款，除了在市内设立储蓄所以外，还在各机关、工厂等单位设立代办所，聘请职工、干部担任代办员和协储员。居民中也建立了储蓄的组织。（附图片）
