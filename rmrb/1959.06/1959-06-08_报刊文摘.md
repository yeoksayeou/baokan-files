Tell the truth, speak honestly

To reflect the actual situation as it is, to say how it is, to say how much there is, without exaggeration or minimization; and without concealing one's own thoughts and opinions, to say good when it is considered good, and to say bad when it is considered bad, never saying one thing and thinking another. This is the noble style that our Communists should have, and it is the excellent quality that every revolutionary cadre should possess.

Marxism is not only for understanding the world, but more importantly for transforming the world. However, only by correctly understanding the world can we correctly transform the world. If we cannot truthfully reflect the original appearance of things, thereby understanding the objective laws of development of things, we cannot correctly change the status quo of things and promote the development of things. In our revolutionary practice, the Party's guidelines, policies, and plans are specifically guiding people to transform the objective world step by step, and these guidelines, policies, and plans can only correctly guide people's actions if they correctly reflect the laws of actual things. For example: only by grasping the true situation of the enemy, ourselves, and our friends can we formulate correct strategic policies; only by understanding the actual conditions for developing production can we set active and reliable targets and practical measures; only by mastering the actual output of products can we make reasonable plans for the distribution and use of products; only by understanding the real ideological situation of the masses can we determine the correct guidelines for propaganda and education work; and so on. If people do not adopt an honest attitude and reflect the true situation, and the leading organs make unrealistic guidelines, policies, and plans based on untrue reflections, it may lead to losses in work. From this, it can be seen that whether or not the true situation can be reflected is a major issue related to whether the Party's guidelines, policies, and plans can be correctly formulated, and whether the revolutionary work can develop smoothly.

People's understanding of objective things always has similarities and differences; there are always correct and incorrect aspects. This is a fact. In order to make people act consistently and correctly in the cause of transforming the objective world, it is necessary to turn inconsistent understandings into consistent understandings; it is necessary to overcome incorrect understandings, develop correct understandings, and make them the guiding ideology for people's actions. The existence of incorrect ideological understanding may lead to the emergence of incorrect actions; the existence of inconsistent understanding will lead to inconsistent actions. This is not good for the Party's work, for others, or for oneself. Therefore, our Party has always required its members and cadres to dare and be good at raising questions, expressing opinions, and criticizing shortcomings in their work; to dare and be good at developing their initiative and creativity, and to work vigorously and energetically; and to oppose liberalism of "knowing that something is wrong, it is better to say less; protecting oneself wisely and seeking no fault." From this, it can be seen that daring to frankly expose one's true thoughts and opinions is also a major issue related to whether the Party's guidelines and policies can be correctly implemented, and whether the Party's work can be carried out smoothly.

Summarizing the meaning of the above two points, it is to tell the truth and speak honestly. Telling the truth and speaking honestly is a matter of the Party spirit of our Communist Party members, and a matter of the quality of revolutionary cadres. Here, some people may ask, isn't it advocated to dare to think and dare to speak? Is telling the truth and speaking honestly contradictory to what we advocate? We say, there is no contradiction at all. What we mean by daring to think and dare to speak is a noble communist style, which is neither unfounded random thinking and talking, nor insincere parroting, neither asking people to talk big, let alone asking people to tell lies; but daring to think and dare to speak with dialectical materialism as the guiding ideology, daring to think and dare to speak based on scientific analysis and seeking truth from facts. People with this style can completely proceed from the interests of the Party and the people, dare to think about problems that predecessors and others dare not think about, dare to say things that predecessors and others dare not say, boldly innovate and create, have theoretical courage, and respect the laws of development of objective things, respect factual basis and conditions, respect the practice of the masses, and respect the opinions of the majority; they dare to support new things emerging on the horizon, and dare to oppose empty fantasies that exceed the possibilities of reality; they dare to say what they think is good, true, and can be done, and dare to say what they think is bad, false, and cannot be done; they are willing to accept correct views approved by the majority, and dare to insist on correct views opposed by the majority; they can praise the achievements and advantages of others, and dare to criticize the shortcomings and mistakes of others from the perspective of care; for the benefit of the Party and the people, in order to uphold the truth, they are not afraid of offending people, nor are they afraid of retaliation. In short, they dare to reflect things and treat things according to their original appearance, and dare to expose their own thoughts and opinions. We believe that this is the real liberation of thought, the real breaking of superstition, the real honest attitude, and scientific attitude. Such a noble style of daring to think and dare to speak should continue to be vigorously promoted.

Secondly, in order to be able to tell the truth and speak honestly, we must also overcome ideological subjectivity and one-sidedness. People often say some wrong things that do not conform to the true facts, and there are also roots in understanding. That is to say, when people deal with problems, they deviate from dialectics and fall into metaphysics; they proceed from subjective wishful thinking and observe things from an isolated, one-sided, and static point of view, and as a result, they may mistake right for wrong, or mistake wrong for right; or regard possibility as reality, or regard reality as possibility; or see truth as falsehood, or see falsehood as truth; or see joy as sorrow, or see sorrow as joy. Although they can tell the truth according to their own views, they cannot reflect the true appearance of things. This situation is also difficult to completely avoid in actual work. This requires us to seriously study materialism and dialectics; learn to understand the overall and various aspects of the contradiction of things, observe problems comprehensively, and overcome ideological one-sidedness; learn to study the contradictions of things "from the surface to the inside," observe problems in depth, and overcome ideological superficiality; by mastering this dialectical materialist method, we can make our understanding improve, deepen, and approach objective reality more closely in the process of "practice, knowledge, re-practice, and re-knowledge." (Excerpted from the commentary in the sixth issue of "Ideological Front" in Shaanxi: "Seek Truth from Facts and Uphold the Truth")

Correct Work Methods
The Bridge to Victory

No matter what work you do, you must pay attention to methods. The same job will produce different results because of the different methods adopted. The degree of correctness of the method is directly proportional to the size of the achievement. The best method can get the best result; the worst method will inevitably get the worst result. Some people think that formulating correct guidelines and tasks can achieve ideal results; some people think that as long as they work hard and desperately, they can create achievements. In fact, the results may not be like this. Correct guidelines, tasks, and soaring revolutionary enthusiasm are all extremely necessary, extremely important, and very valuable; however, if there are only these, without the correct working methods, it is still possible to be contrary to one's wishes and gain nothing. This is like a chef having firewood, rice, oil, salt, sauce, vinegar, and vegetables, but it does not mean that there is a delicious and palatable meal. Some people regard the issue of working methods as an unimportant and very secondary issue, which is obviously wrong.

The so-called work, in summary, can be归结为the following formula: "Task - Method - Result". That is to say, first determine the "task", then take appropriate "methods" to carry out the work, and finally achieve "results". The whole work, on the surface, looks like thousands of threads, but in fact it is the continuous continuation of such a process, sometimes it is carried out in a single line, and sometimes it is carried out in multiple lines or staggered. From this process or formula, it can be clearly seen in what an important position the "method" is in. Comrade Mao Zedong told us twenty-five years ago. He said: "We must not only set tasks, but also solve the problem of methods to complete the tasks. Our task is to cross the river, but we cannot cross without a bridge or a boat. Without solving the problem of bridges or boats, crossing the river is empty talk. Without solving the method problem, the task is just nonsense." ("Selected Works of Mao Zedong" page 134.) Indeed, the correct working method is like a "bridge" to victory, with which work can achieve the due results. Even if there are many difficulties in the work, it can be turned into a "thoroughfare" because of "a bridge flying across the north and south". Therefore, working methods must be paid attention to.

    报刊文摘
    要说真话，说实话
    如实地反映实际情况，是怎样就说怎样，有多少说多少，不夸大、不缩小；也毫不隐讳自己的想法和看法，认为好的就说好，认为坏的就说坏，绝不嘴上一套心里另一套。这是我们共产党人应有的崇高风格，也是每一个革命干部应当具备的优良品质。
    马克思主义不只是为了认识世界，更重要的是在于改造世界。但是，只有正确地认识了世界，才能进而正确地改造世界。不能如实地反映事物的本来面貌，从而了解事物的客观的发展规律，就无法正确地变革事物的现状，促进事物的发展。在我们的革命实践中，党的方针、政策、计划就是具体指导人们去一步一步地改造客观世界的，而这些方针、政策、计划只有正确地反映了实际事物的规律，它才能够正确地指导人们的行动。比如：掌握了敌、我、友三方面的真实情况，才能定出正确的战略方针；了解了发展生产的各项实际条件，才能定出积极可靠的指标和切实可行的措施；掌握了产品的真实产量，才能作出合理安排产品分配和使用的计划；了解了群众的真实思想情况，才能确定宣传教育工作的正确方针；如此等等。如果人们不采取老老实实的态度，反映真实情况，而领导机关依据不真实的反映，就可能作出不切实际的方针、政策、计划，结果就会招致工作上的损失。由此可见，能不能反映真实情况，是关系到党的方针、政策、计划能否正确制定，关系到革命工作能否顺利发展的大问题。
    人们对于客观事物的认识，总有一致的地方，也总有不一致的地方；总有正确的，也总有不正确的。这是存在着的事实。为了使人们在改造客观世界的事业中一致地正确地行动，就必须把不一致的认识变成一致的认识；必须克服不正确的认识，发展正确的认识，并使它成为人们行动的指导思想。而有不正确的思想认识存在，就可能有不正确的行动出现；存在不一致的认识，就会有不一致的行动。这对党的工作，对人、对己都是不好的。所以我们党一贯要求自己的党员和干部，在工作中要敢于和善于提出问题，发表意见，批评缺点；敢于和善于发扬自己的主动性、创造性，朝气蓬勃、生龙活虎般地工作；反对“明知不对，少说为佳；明哲保身，但求无过”的自由主义。由此可见，敢于坦率地暴露自己的真实的思想观点，也是关系到党的方针政策能否正确地贯彻执行，关系到党的工作能否顺利开展的大问题。
    总结上面两点的意思，就是说，要说真话，说实话。说真话，说实话，这是我们共产党员的党性问题，是革命干部的品质问题。这里，有人或许要问，不是提倡敢想敢说吗？说真话，说实话，这和我们所提倡的敢想敢说是不是矛盾呢？我们说，一点也不矛盾。我们所说的敢想敢说，是一种高尚的共产主义风格，它既不是无根据的乱想乱说，也不是言不由衷的人云亦云，既不是要人说大话，更不是要人说假话；而是以辩证唯物主义作为指导思想的敢想敢说，是建立在科学分析、实事求是基础上的敢想敢说。具有这种风格的人，能够完完全全从党和人民的利益出发，既敢于想前人和别人不敢想的问题，说前人和别人不敢说的话，大胆革新创造，具有理论上的勇敢，又是尊重客观事物的发展规律的，尊重事实根据和条件的，尊重群众的实践的，尊重多数人的意见的；既敢于支持地平线上出现的新鲜事物，又敢于反对超越现实可能性的空想；既敢于说自己认为好的、真的、能办到的事情，又敢于说自己认为坏的、假的、办不到的事情；既勇于接受多数人赞成的正确观点，又敢于坚持多数人反对的正确见解；既能表扬别人的成绩和优点，又敢于从爱护观点出发批评别人的缺点和错误；为了党和人民的利益，为了坚持真理，不怕得罪人，也不怕人报复。总之，既敢于按照事物的本来面貌反映事物、对待事物，也敢于暴露自己的思想观点。我们认为，这样才算是真正的解放思想，真正的破除迷信、真正的老实态度、科学态度。这样的敢想敢说的高尚风格，要继续大力提倡。
    其次，要能够说真话、说实话，还要克服思想上的主观性、片面性。人们往往说出一些错误的、不符合事实真象的话，还有认识上的根源。就是说，人们在处理问题的时候，离开了辩证法，陷入了形而上学；从主观的想当然出发，用孤立的、片面的、静止的观点观察事物，其结果就有可能或者误是为非，误非为是；或者把可能性当作现实性，把现实性当作可能性；或者看真为假，看假为真；或者视喜为忧，视忧为喜。他们虽然可以按着自己的观点说老实话，但是并不能反映事物的真象。这种情况，在实际工作中也是难于完全避免的。这就要求我们必须认真地学习唯物论和辩证法；学会了解事物矛盾的总体和各个方面，全面地观察问题，克服思想上的片面性；学会“由表及里”地研究事物的矛盾，深入地观察问题，克服思想上的表面性；掌握了这种辩证唯物主义的方法，我们就有可能使自己的认识在“实践、认识、再实践、再认识”的过程中，一次比一次提高，一次比一次深化，一次比一次更接近于客观实际。（摘自陕西“思想战线”第六期评论：“实事求是，坚持真理”）
    正确的工作方法
    通向胜利的桥梁
    无论做什么工作，都要讲究方法。同样一件工作，因为采取的方法不同，就会产生不同的效果。方法的正确程度，同取得成绩的大小，成正比例。最好的方法，可以得到最好的结果；最坏的方法，必然得到最坏的结果。有的人认为，制定了正确的方针、任务，就可以取得理想的结果；有的人认为，只要自己辛辛苦苦、拼命工作，就可以创造出成绩来。其实，结果未必是这样。正确的方针、任务和冲天的革命干劲，这些都是极其需要、极其重要、十分可贵的；但是，如果只有这些，而没有正确的工作方法，还是可能事与愿违，劳而无获的。这如同厨师有了柴米油盐酱醋菜，并不等于就有了一餐美味可口的饭菜是一样的道理。有的人，把工作方法问题，当作一个无足轻重、十分次要的问题，显然，这是错误的。
    所谓做工作，概括起来，可以归结为如下的公式：“任务——方法——结果”。也就是说，首先要确定“任务”，随着就要采取适当的“方法”进行工作，最后取得“结果”。全部工作，表面看来尽管千头万绪，但实际上就是这样一个过程的不断继续，有时是这样单线进行，有时是多头并进或者交错进行。从这个过程或公式中，可以清楚地看出，
  “方法”是处在怎样一个重要的位置上。毛泽东同志在二十五年以前曾告诉过我们。他说：“我们不但要提出任务，而且要解决完成任务的方法问题。我们的任务是过河，但是没有桥或没有船就不能过。不解决桥或船的问题，过河就是一句空话。不解决方法问题，任务也只是瞎说一顿。”（“毛泽东选集”一三四页。）的确，正确的工作方法，就像一座通向胜利的“桥”，有了它，就可以使工作取得应有的成绩。即使工作中有许多困难，也可以因为“一桥飞架南北”，而使“天堑变通途”。所以，工作方法必须讲究。
