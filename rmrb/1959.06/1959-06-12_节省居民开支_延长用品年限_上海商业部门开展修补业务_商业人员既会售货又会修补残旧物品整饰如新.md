    Saving Residents' Expenses, Extending the Lifespan of Goods
    Shanghai Commercial Departments Launch Repair Services
    Commercial Personnel Can Both Sell Goods and Repair Old Items to Make Them Look Like New
    (Our Dispatch) Shanghai commercial departments are actively involved in the organization of people's economic life, vigorously developing repair services for daily necessities, and striving to meet the needs of the general public in this regard.
    To date, the city has increased the number of shops and stalls engaged in various repair and service activities to more than 10,000, covering more than a dozen industries that are most closely related to the daily lives of the general public, including department stores, clothing, shoes and hats, hardware, furniture, cookware, bicycles, and radios, with more than 27,000 employees. They are distributed in streets, alleys, and entrances of residential compounds, repairing and providing services for hundreds of daily necessities for the people. According to incomplete statistics, in recent months, these shops and stalls have repaired 100,000 radios (times), more than 500,000 bicycles (times), more than 200,000 pairs of leather shoes, more than 200,000 rice cookers and kettles, as well as countless clothes, rubber shoes, umbrellas, fountain pens, and so on. Their labor has restored damaged goods to a new condition, saving residents' expenses and making full use of social materials.
    Shanghai commercial departments have adopted a variety of repair and service forms according to different commodities. One form is "selling with repair, making with repair." All commodities that fall within the business scope of stores and workshops and can be repaired by themselves are repaired for customers. For example, most department stores in Hongkou and Penglai districts now undertake the repair of some daily necessities. All twenty-seven shoe stores in Luwan District are now engaged in shoe repair, doing everything from replacing soles and heels to sewing and patching holes. Some fashion stores on Nanjing Road and Huaihai Road that have always specialized in high-end clothing have recently added services for renovating and repairing old clothes. Many furniture workshops and stores have launched telephone service businesses for repairing bulky items such as wooden furniture, sofas, and palm mats. Residents can simply make a phone call and someone will come to their door to discuss the matter. Some minor problems with radios and bicycles are repaired by the stores themselves, while more difficult repairs are taken to workshops with better equipment and technology for centralized repair. Another form is to set up comprehensive repair service stations to repair a certain type of commodity for customers. The repair service station opened by the Yimiao District Department Store has specialized workshops and personnel to repair more than twenty types of department store goods, such as rubber shoes, umbrellas, and zippers, for customers. Stall services are even more thoughtful and flexible. Repairing leather shoes and patching pots are done at fixed stalls with long-term service; sharpening scissors and repairing washbasins are done by going from street to street, providing mobile service. Some stalls have also established contact with neighborhood residents' committees and go to the neighborhoods to repair goods at agreed times.
    In order to repair faster and better and save residents' expenses, many store clerks have launched mutual teaching and learning activities to become both salespeople and repairers. More than 80% of the clerks in the Jiangning District Dazhong Department Store have learned repair skills, and some can even repair three or four items such as zippers, rubber shoes, belts, and socks. Therefore, some simple repairs can be done immediately, and more complex items can be returned quickly. When repairing items, commercial personnel are careful and make every effort to use waste materials, "repairing the old with the old," which saves materials and reduces the burden on consumers.

    节省居民开支　延长用品年限
    上海商业部门开展修补业务
    商业人员既会售货又会修补残旧物品整饰如新
    本报讯　上海商业部门在积极组织人民经济生活中，大力开展日常生活用品修补业务，尽力满足广大居民这方面的需要。
    到目前为止，全市从事各种修配服务的商店和摊头已经增加到一万多个，包括与广大居民日常生活最为密切的百货、服装、鞋帽、五金、家具、炊具、自行车、收音机等十多个行业，从业人员有二万七千多人。他们分布在街头巷尾和居民集中的弄堂门口，为人们修配几百种日常用品。据不完全统计，最近几个月来，这些店摊修理了收音机十万架（次），自行车五十多万辆（次），皮鞋二十多万双，饭锅、水壶二十多万只，以及难以计数的衣服、胶鞋、雨伞、金笔等等。他们的劳动使破损的用品修整如新，既节约了居民的开支，又使社会物资得到充分利用。
    上海商业部门根据不同商品采取了多种多样的修配服务形式。有一种是“有卖有修，以造带修”。凡是属于商店、作场经营范围、自己也能修理的商品，就代客修理。例如虹口、蓬莱等区的百货店，现在基本上家家都承修部分日用品。卢湾区的二十七家皮鞋店已经全部兼营皮鞋修理业务，换底、配跟、缝线、补洞，样样都做。南京路、淮海路上一些向来专做高级服装的时装店，最近也增加了旧衣翻新和修补的服务项目。许多家具作场、商店对修理木器家具、沙发、棕棚等笨重物件，开展了电话服务业务，居民只要打个电话，就有人上门联系。收音机、自行车的一些小毛病，由承修商店各自修理，比较难修的就拿到设备和技术较好的工场集中修理。另一种是设立综合性的修配服务站，为顾客修理某一类的商品。邑庙区百货商店开设的修配服务站，就有专门的工场和人员，代客修理胶鞋、雨伞、拉链等二十多种百货商品。摊头的服务更是周到而灵活。修皮鞋、补锅子，定点设摊、长驻服务；磨剪刀，修面盆，串街走巷，流动服务。有些摊头还同里弄的居民委员会建立了联系，在约定的时间内下里弄修理用品。
    为了修得更快更好，节约居民开支，许多商店的营业员开展了互教互学，做到既会售货，又会修配。江宁区大众百货商场的营业员中，80％以上的都学会了修配，有的甚至能够修补拉链、胶鞋、皮带和袜子等三、四种物品。因此，有些简单修理可以做到随到随修，比较复杂的用品交件也很迅速。商业人员在修理物品的时候，精打细算，尽量利用废旧材料，“以旧修旧”，既节约了物资，又减轻了消费者的负担。
    上海许多商店一向兼营某些商品的修配业务。为了进一步发扬这个优点，更好地为消费者服务，中共上海市委财政贸易工作部今年1月份指示有关商业部门积极发展商品的修理配换业务，把它当作关心群众生活的一项重要工作。市、区商业部门组织专门力量，加强领导，批判了部分商业人员认为修配业务零星繁杂、可有可无等片面观点，并且统一安排了全市的修配服务网与修配物资的供应，促进了这项业务的展开。（叶世涛、周永康）
