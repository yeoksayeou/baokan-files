    The people of South Korea under the rule of the American and Syngman Rhee bandit gang are in a miserable situation. They live in poverty, hunger, and oppression every day. The number of people reduced to beggars is increasing day by day. About one-third of the people in Seoul require relief, but they get nothing.
    Although South Korea is rich in rice, the US imperialists' destructive policies towards agriculture and forestry, as well as the Syngman Rhee bandit gang's plunder of rice, force the South Korean people to use animal feed as their main food, leading to chronic starvation.
    In particular, the fate of more than 200,000 South Korean war orphans is the most tragic. They are without relatives, wandering everywhere, making a living by shining shoes, picking up scraps, and begging, even starving to death and dying of illness.

    These things sold in stalls in Seoul are not rice, but rice bran. And it is not easy for the poor people of South Korea to have money to buy rice bran to fill their hunger. (Attached picture)
    War orphans are displaced, and some rely on shining shoes for American soldiers to make a living.

    在美军占领下的南朝鲜人民生活悲惨
    在美李匪帮统治下的南朝鲜的人民处境悲惨，他们终日过着贫困、饥饿和受压迫的生活，沦落为乞丐者日益增多，汉城大约有三分之一的人要求救济，但是他们什么也得不到。
    在南朝鲜虽然盛产大米，但是由于美帝国主义实行农林经济的破坏政策以及美李匪帮对大米的掠夺，使南朝鲜人民不得不以动物饲料作为他们的主要食物，以致陷于慢性的饥饿状态中。
    特别是二十多万南朝鲜战争孤儿的命运最为悲惨，他们举目无亲，到处流浪，靠擦皮鞋、捡破烂、求乞过活，甚至饿死和病死。（本栏图片均系新华社稿）
    汉城街头摊子卖的这些东西不是大米而是米糠。而南朝鲜的穷苦人民有钱买到米糠来充饥已经是不容易的了。（附图片）
    战争孤儿流离失所，有些靠给美国兵擦皮鞋为生。
