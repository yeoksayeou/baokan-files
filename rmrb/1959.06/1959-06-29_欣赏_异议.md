    "Appreciating" Dissent
    Xu Wei
    After reading the article "Appreciating" (People's Daily, March 17th, page 8), I have some differing views.
    Although the middle school Chinese teacher in the article, after saying that manure cannot be appreciated, was debated by students, realized his error, and even found the root of the "emotional problem," I believe he was not at fault and therefore need not blame himself. This is because manure, while certainly a fertilizer for crops, and something that people can and should treat as a valuable resource to be utilized, is valuable only for its practical value, not its aesthetic value. Aesthetic value and practical value are two different things; they can be unified, or they can be separate, even opposed. Saying that manure cannot be appreciated does not mean that manure is useless, much less that one should discourage people from accumulating fertilizer. If a person goes to the countryside and sees farmers accumulating fertilizer, but he finds it dirty and smelly and is unwilling to come into contact with the farmers, it should be said that his emotions are problematic because he ignores the significance of this labor. Conversely, to say that manure has aesthetic value, as if the farmers accumulating fertilizer have a penchant for appreciating manure, is also an emotional problem, because he does not truly know that the reason and significance for farmers accumulating fertilizer lies in using it to strive for abundant harvests, and not, as he says, because manure can be appreciated.
    Emotional problems that have not been resolved should, of course, be resolved, but the way to solve them should be to spend more time laboring and living with the masses, truly understanding them, and transforming one's own thoughts and feelings, rather than misunderstanding them and making inappropriate conjectures about them.

    “欣赏”异议
    徐味
    读“欣赏”一文（3月17日人民日报第八版），有些不同的看法。
    虽然文章里的那位中学语文教员在说了大粪不能欣赏之后，遭到学生的议论，而自觉错误，甚至找出了“感情问题”的根源，但是我却认为他并无错处，因而毋须自责。因为大粪固然是农作物的肥料，人们可以而且应该把它当做宝贵的东西来加以利用，但这仅是因为它的实用价值，而不是因为它的欣赏价值。欣赏价值和实用价值，是两个不同的东西，它可以统一，也可以不统一，甚至可以是对立的。说大粪不能欣赏，并不等于说大粪无用，更不等于鼓励人不去积肥。如果一个人到了乡间看到农民在积肥，他自己嫌脏怕臭，不愿与农民接触，这应该说他的感情有问题，因为他忽视了这种劳动的意义。相反把大粪说成有欣赏价值，好像积肥的农民有欣赏大粪的癖好，这同样也是感情问题，因为他并不真正知道农民积肥的原因和意义在于利用大粪来争取农作物的丰产，而不是如他所说的是因为大粪可以欣赏。
    感情问题没有解决的，当然应该力求解决，但解决的办法，应该多与群众在一起劳动和生活，真正了解他们，改造自己的思想感情，而不是误解他们，对他们作不恰当的臆测。
