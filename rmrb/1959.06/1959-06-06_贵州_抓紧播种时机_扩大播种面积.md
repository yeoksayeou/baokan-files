Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 4th. People's communes in various parts of Guizhou Province are seizing the opportune time to "get seeds into the ground and grain into storage," actively expanding the planting area.

After the people's communes in various places handed over the production plans to the masses for discussion, the commune members all supported the policy of cultivating large areas of high-yield fields and combining multiple plantings with increased harvests. In the Bijie Special District, 670,000 mu of land, originally planned to be returned to cultivation from 720,000 mu, has now been planted. Various places have also made full use of scattered land to expand the cultivated area. Through checking empty fields, field edges, and interspersed land, the Zunyi Special District discovered a total of 350,000 mu of usable land, which has now all been sown. Commune members in the Tongren Special District are expanding the cultivated area by planting beans in the fields, castor beans along the roads, pumpkins on land corners, and vegetables in front and behind houses. The Baide People's Commune in Xingren County used scattered land to plant more than 400,000 nests of pumpkins and beans in five days. (Attached picture)

    贵州  抓紧播种时机  扩大播种面积
    新华社贵阳4日电  贵州省各地人民公社正抓紧“种籽落地，万粒归仓”的大好时光，积极扩大播种面积。
    各地人民公社在把生产计划交给群众讨论后，社员们都拥护培植大面积高额丰产田和多种多收相结合的方针。毕节专区把原来准备退耕的七十二万亩土地，现在又种上了六十七万亩。各地还充分利用零星土地扩大耕地面积。遵义专区通过查空田土、查田边地角、查插花地等，共查出可利用的土地三十五万亩，现在都播种上了。铜仁专区各公社社员在田上种豆子、路旁种蓖麻、土地角种南瓜、房前房后种蔬菜扩大耕种面积。兴仁县百德人民公社利用零星土地在五天中播种了南瓜和豆子四十多万窝。（附图片）
