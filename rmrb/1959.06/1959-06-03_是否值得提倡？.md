    Is it Worth Advocating?

    In newspapers and periodicals, one often comes across news reports and literary works that describe children carrying fifty jin of stones, and still "walking fast"; old people unwilling to do light work, but instead carrying earth until late at night every day; sick people concealing their illness from doctors and secretly working; pregnant women secretly working during their designated rest time… These articles share a common feature: they reflect things that seem beyond the capabilities of ordinary people, and use this to express people's selfless labor spirit. However, I believe that these should not be reported in newspapers and periodicals as entirely positive content. I think that although the spirit of people who want to do more for the socialist motherland, even to the point of doing things beyond their capabilities, is good, they should be persuaded not to force themselves to do these things, and others should not be encouraged to do so as well. Therefore, it is not appropriate to advocate for these things in news reports and literary works. Our newspapers and periodicals have a high reputation among the masses. If these deeds are enthusiastically introduced and praised in the newspapers, it will inevitably create the impression that we are advocating doing those things that are beyond one's capabilities.

    是否值得提倡？
    在报刊上常常接触到这样的通讯报道和文艺作品，它们写小孩挑五十斤的石头，还“快步如飞”；老人不愿做清闲工作，而是每天挑土直至深夜；有病的人瞒着医生偷偷地工作；怀孕的妇女在规定的休息时间还暗中出勤……这些文章的一个共同特点，就是反映常人看来是力不能及的事情，并以此表现人们忘我的劳动精神。但我却认为，这些都不宜在报刊上作为完全肯定的内容来反映。我认为，想为社会主义祖国多作一些事，甚至干出力不能及的事情的人们，他们的精神固然很好，但是应该说服他们，不要勉为其难地去作这些事，也不应该鼓励别人也去这样作。因此，不宜在新闻报道和文艺作品中加以提倡。我们的报刊在群众中有着崇高的威信，假如这些事迹在报刊上都给以热情的介绍和赞扬，势必造成这样的一种印象，好像我们是提倡干上面那些力不能及的事情的。
