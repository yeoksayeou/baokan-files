    Potatoes Made into Citric Acid
    There is a white, acidic crystal that is needed by doctors, confectionery and pastry makers, chefs, and textile workers – this is citric acid. People use citric acid to flavor food, make various fruit candies, dye fabrics, and manufacture medicines.
    In the past, citric acid could only be made from lemons. Now, people have been using sugar, and even residue from sugar production, to make it. Soviet Leningrad scientists, Professors Chesnokov and Ilyinsky, have recently proven that several types of potatoes contain a considerable amount of citric acid. They have now developed a method for recovering citric acid when potatoes are processed into starch. According to scientists' calculations, about three kilograms of citric acid can be made from each ton of potatoes.

    马铃薯制成柠檬酸
    有一种为医生、糖果点心制造者、厨师和纺织工人等所需要的白色酸性结晶——这就是柠檬酸。人们利用柠檬酸来调味，制造各种水果糖，染布匹以及制造药物。
    过去，柠檬酸只能用柠檬来制造，现在人们已用糖，甚至制糖后的残渣来制造它了，苏联列宁格勒的科学家切斯诺科夫和伊林斯基教授最近又证明，有几种马铃薯含有相当大量的柠檬酸。现在他们已制定了在把马铃薯制成淀粉时回收柠檬酸的方法。根据科学家的计算，每吨马铃薯可以制成约三公斤的柠檬酸。
