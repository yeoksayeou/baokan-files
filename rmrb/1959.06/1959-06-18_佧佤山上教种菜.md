    Teaching Vegetable Cultivation on the Wa Mountains
    A few years ago, vegetables were not grown on the Wa Mountains. The Wa people only had a bowl of salt water and a dish of chili peppers with their meals. Now, every Wa family in Dalisuo Village has vegetables with their meals. If you ask about this change, they will tell you a story.
    When the Sixth Company of a certain unit first arrived in Dalisuo Village, the area around the village was overgrown with weeds. The company commander led the entire company in cutting through thorns and opening up an acre of land, sowing the first batch of vegetable seeds on the Wa Mountains. At this time, kind-hearted Wa elders came to warn them, "Comrade Soldiers, we have never grown vegetables for generations. They won't grow here." The elders' words had some truth, as the Wa Mountains were dry and windy, and the seedlings withered as soon as they sprouted. The soldiers then tried planting again, but they encountered a long rainy season of several months, and the seedlings were flooded to death. Although the vegetable growing failed that year, they learned the Wa Mountains' temperament. The following year, they planted when the rainy season was about to begin, and harvested when the rainy season arrived. They planted when the rainy season was about to end, and harvested after the rainy season passed. Vegetables finally grew, and all the officers and soldiers were so happy that they wrote home to ask for vegetable seeds. Thus, in this remote borderland of the motherland, northern Chinese cabbage, Shandong scallions, Sichuan kohlrabi, pumpkins, garlic, chives, and other vegetables grew. Last year, there was a bumper harvest of vegetables, with some radishes weighing four and a half catties. The entire company invited the Wa people from nearby villages, used the vegetables they grew, the pigs they raised, and the wheat they grew to grind into flour, made dumplings for everyone to eat, and explained how to grow vegetables. As a result, the Wa people of Dalisuo also began to grow vegetables in large quantities. (Zhang Dongming)

    佧佤山上教种菜
    几年以前，佧佤山上还没有种过蔬菜，佧佤人吃饭时只有一碗盐水和一碟辣椒。现在，大力索寨的任何一个佧佤人家，吃饭时都有了蔬菜。如果你问起这个变化，他们会告诉你一个故事。
    某部六连刚进驻大力索寨时，寨子附近都是野草丛生的荒山，连长带领全连官兵披荆斩棘，开出了一亩土地，在佧佤山上撒下了第一批菜籽。这时，好心的佧佤老人跑来警告说：“大军同志：我们世世代代都没有种过菜，种在这里也不会长的。”老人的话确有几分根据，佧佤山上天旱风大，菜苗刚出土就枯死了。官兵们接着又种，又碰上漫长几个月的雨季，菜苗又涝死了。这一年种菜虽以失败告终，但他们却摸到了佧佤山的脾气，第二年就在雨季快来时种，雨季到了收；雨季快过种，过了雨季收。蔬菜终于长出来了，全连官兵高兴得都寄信向家里要菜籽。于是祖国这块遥远的边地，长出了北方的大白菜，山东大葱，四川大头菜和南瓜、大蒜、韭菜等。去年蔬菜大丰收，一个萝卜有四斤半重。全连官兵把附近各寨的佧佤人请来，用自己种的菜、养的猪，种的麦子磨成的面，包了一顿饺子请大家吃，一面介绍种菜的方法。于是，大力索的佧佤人也大量种菜了。　（张东明）
