Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, June 29th. The Conference on Non-Staple Food and Handicraft Production in Large and Medium Cities, held by the CCP Central Committee in Shanghai, concluded on the 23rd after six days.

The conference was presided over by Li Xiannian, member of the Political Bureau of the CCP Central Committee, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee, and Vice Premier of the State Council. Ke Qingshi, member of the Political Bureau of the CCP Central Committee and First Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee, spoke at the conference. Participants included heads of relevant departments of the CCP Central Committee and the State Council, secretaries of municipal party committees of 37 large and medium cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, and Wuhan, and heads of relevant departments, totaling 165 people.

The conference focused on discussing the guidelines and policies for urban non-staple food production and handicraft production.

The conference believed that to solve the problem of urban non-staple food supply, it is necessary to adopt the principle of self-reliance as the mainstay and strive for foreign aid as a supplement, and vigorously develop non-staple food production in suburban areas, organs, troops, schools, and among residents. At the same time, in rural areas, it is necessary to continue to expand the commodity production of non-staple foods, actively support cities, and promote urban-rural cooperation and mutual support.

The conference analyzed the current situation of non-staple food production and supply. Due to the development of production and construction in cities and factories, and the increase in the population of urban and factory areas, the demand for non-staple foods and other means of livelihood has increased; after communization, communal dining halls, and the great leap forward in production, the vast number of peasants have also increased their own consumption of various non-staple foods. Therefore, in the recent period, there has been a phenomenon of insufficient non-staple food supply. At present, the vegetable supply situation in most cities has improved, and the supply of other varieties of non-staple foods will also be resolved successively after different periods of time. In order to fundamentally solve this problem, it is absolutely necessary for cities to adopt the principle of self-reliance as the mainstay and strive for foreign aid as a supplement to develop non-staple food production. Developing non-staple food production in cities is a long-term policy and must be resolutely implemented ideologically, organizationally, and through measures. There are certain difficulties in implementing this policy in terms of labor arrangement, feed supply, and technical experience, but as long as we rely on the masses and strengthen leadership, we can overcome these difficulties.

What are the favorable conditions and benefits of developing non-staple food production in cities? The conference believed that at present, large and medium cities generally have large suburban areas, which are production bases for urban non-staple food development. The near suburbs should focus on vegetable production while also developing other non-staple foods; the far suburbs should focus on grain, cotton, and oil production, while also comprehensively developing agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery. However, far suburbs should devote more effort to developing non-staple food production than other rural areas. The development of these bases can not only utilize the favorable conditions of the cities, making full use of urban manpower, material resources, and financial resources, but also save transportation resources, reduce the loss of long-distance transportation of non-staple foods, and ensure timely supply.

China has a vast territory, and natural conditions such as climate and soil vary from place to place, so the varieties, degree, and time of achieving self-sufficiency in non-staple foods will vary from place to place. The quantity should increase from small to large, the variety should increase from simple to complex, and some varieties should gradually achieve relatively comprehensive self-sufficiency from partial self-sufficiency. At present, the urban supply of non-staple foods mainly relies on rural areas, and rural areas should allocate non-staple foods to cities according to plan, on time and in quantity. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the procurement of non-staple foods in rural areas. Even in the future, rural areas should continue to actively support cities. Cities support rural areas with industrial products, and rural areas support cities with agricultural products. This relationship of urban-rural mutual assistance should continue to develop.

Regarding the issue of handicraft production, the conference proposed the following guideline: vigorously restore and develop handicraft production, requiring that the variety, quantity, and quality of handicraft products can be restored and developed. The conference pointed out that in 1958, China's total handicraft output value increased by 50% compared to 1957. This was a tremendous leap forward. However, in the process of economic reorganization, due to insufficient comprehensive arrangements in our work, some small commodities and repair service industries were squeezed out, causing temporary difficulties in market supply and bringing some inconvenience to people's lives. In order to change this situation, we should first restore the commodities that people urgently need and are in season, and prepare for the production of autumn and winter products, while also considering the market needs of next year and the long term. To this end, we must strengthen the leadership of handicrafts. Some handicraft cadres and personnel who have changed their profession should return to their original posts as much as possible.

Handicrafts are an important part of China's national economy for a long time to come. The conference stipulated that in arranging handicraft production in the future, we should take into account production and life, domestic and foreign sales, high-end, sophisticated, and large items, as well as low-end, crude, and small items, quantity and quality, and other aspects, taking into account overall consideration and comprehensive arrangement. Diversification should be achieved in terms of variety, service method, production process, and the ownership of the means of production.

The conference unanimously believed that as long as we are determined, the Party committee takes the lead, mobilizes the masses, launches a mass movement, and takes practical and effective organizational measures, it is entirely possible to achieve rapid growth in urban non-staple food production and handicraft production. The conference called on Party organizations and relevant departments at all levels across the country to make prompt decisions, seize favorable opportunities, carry out a blitz with a fighting attitude, and strive to successfully complete the tasks stipulated by the conference in a not-too-long period of time.

    中共中央召开城市副食品手工业生产会议确定方针
    自力更生辅以外援改善副食品供应
    统筹兼顾全面安排恢复发展手工业
    会议要求全国各级党组织和有关部门当机立断，抓紧有利时机，以战斗的姿态进行突击，争取在一个不长的时期内，胜利地完成会议所规定的任务。
    新华社上海29日电　中共中央在上海举行的大中城市副食品、手工业生产会议，历时六天，已在23日闭幕。
    会议由中共中央政治局委员、中央书记处书记、国务院副总理李先念主持。中共中央政治局委员、上海市市委第一书记柯庆施在会上讲了话。参加会议的有中共中央、国务院有关部门的负责人，北京、上海、天津、广州、武汉等三十七个大中城市的市委书记，以及有关部门的负责人等一百六十五人。
    会议着重讨论了城市副食品生产和手工业生产的方针政策。
    会议认为解决城市副食品供应问题，必须采取自力更生为主、力争外援为辅的方针，在郊区、机关部队、学校和居民中大力发展副食品生产。同时，在农村还应当继续扩大副食品商品生产，积极支援城市，城乡协作、互相支援。
    会议对于目前副食品生产和供应的情况进行了分析。由于城市、厂矿的生产和建设发展了，城市和厂矿区域的人口增多了，对于副食品以及其他生活资料的需要量都增加了；广大农民在公社化、食堂化和生产大跃进以后，他们自己消费的各种副食品也增加了。因此，在最近一个时期内，出现了副食品供应不足的现象。现在，多数城市的蔬菜供应情况已经改善，其他不同品种的副食品的供应也将经过不同的时间陆续解决。为了从根本上解决这个问题，城市采取自力更生为主、力争外援为辅的方针发展副食品生产，是完全必要的。在城市发展副食品生产，是个长期的方针，必须从思想上、组织上、措施上坚决贯彻。实现这个方针，在劳动力安排、饲料供应、技术经验等方面，是有一定困难的，但是只要依靠群众，加强领导，就能够克服困难。
    城市发展副食品生产有哪些有利条件和好处呢？会议认为，现在各地大中城市一般都拥有大片郊区，是城市发展副食品的生产基地。近郊区应当以生产蔬菜为主，同时发展其他副食品；远郊区应当以生产粮、棉、油为主，同时全面发展农林牧副渔各项生产，但是远郊区应该比其他农村多用一些力量发展副食品生产。这些基地的发展，既可以利用城市的有利条件，使城市的人力、物力、财力得到充分的利用，又可以节省交通运输力量，减少副食品长途调运的损耗，保证及时供应。
    我国地区辽阔，各地气候、土壤等自然条件都不一样，所以各地在实现副食品自给的品种、程度、时间上，都会有所不同。应当在数量上由少到多，品种上由简到繁，有些品种由部分自给逐步达到比较全面的自给。目前城市的副食品供应，主要还是依靠农村，农村应当按计划如期如数地把副食品调拨给城市。因此，必须加强农村副食品的采购工作。就是在将来，农村仍然应当积极支援城市。城市支援农村工业品，农村支援城市农产品，这种城乡互助关系，应当继续发展。
    关于手工业生产问题，会议提出的方针是：大力恢复和发展手工业生产，要求做到手工业的产品品种、数量和质量都能恢复和发展。会议指出，1958年我国手工业总产值比1957年增长了50％。这是一个巨大的跃进。但是在经济改组的过程当中，由于工作上安排得不够全面，挤掉了一些小商品和修理服务行业，造成市场供应的一时困难，给人民生活带来了一些不便。为了改变这种状况，目前应当首先恢复人民迫切需要的和当令的商品，并且准备秋冬产品的生产，同时考虑到明年和今后长期的市场需要。为此，必须加强手工业的领导。改了行的一部分手工业干部和人员，应该尽可能归队。
    手工业是长时期内我国国民经济中一个重要组成部分。会议规定，今后在安排手工业的生产时，要考虑到生产和生活，内销和外销，高级的、精密的、大件的和低级的、粗制的、小件的，产量和质量等各个方面，统筹兼顾，全面安排。在花色品种、服务方式、生产过程、以及生产资料所有制方面，都应该多样化。
    会议一致认为，只要下定决心，党委亲自抓，发动群众，大搞群众运动，并且采取切实有效的组织措施，在城市实现副食品生产和手工业生产的迅速增长是完全可能的。会议要求全国各级党组织和有关部门当机立断，抓紧有利时机，以战斗的姿态，进行突击，争取在一个不长的时期内，胜利地完成会议所规定的任务。
