	A Tragedy of Comedy
	Not long ago, Beijing audiences were pleased to enjoy the famous Sichuan opera comedy "Forced Marriage," and now they have seen the Hong Kong Phoenix Film Company's color costume story film "Snatching the Bride," adapted from the former.
	Giving birth to a daughter only to have her forcibly married off is inherently a tragedy. However, compared to the tragic life of a "white-haired palace maid, idly gossiping about Emperor Xuanzong," burying one's youthful years and never seeing the light of day, people are still willing to choose the inferior option of a forced marriage. Therefore, it is no wonder that the people of Qiantang County had to engage in a fierce "forced marriage war" after seeing the imperial edict for "beauty selection." The Sichuan opera "Forced Marriage" humorously, wittily, and satirically exposes the tragedy of human separation and death caused by feudal emperors in the form of comedy, and satirizes and ridicules the various ugly behaviors of the ruling class from top to bottom. The adaptation of "Snatching the Bride" preserves the basic spirit of the original work. Although it does not adopt the form of opera, it absorbs some of the advantages of the Sichuan opera "Forced Marriage" and fully utilizes the characteristics of film art, developing some aspects even further than the stage play.
	For example, the scene of the wedding in the county government is very successful. On one side, the county magistrate is telling Wei Gonggong, the confidant of the imperial envoy who is urging the completion of the "beauty selection" task, that the marriage between his daughter and Li Yu was arranged twenty years ago when they were still in the womb; on the other side, the county magistrate's wife is using force in the inner room to persuade and bind Li Yu: "Husband! Please agree!" On one side, Li Yu is struggling and shouting for help; on the other side, the master of ceremonies is shouting loudly in the hall: "Auspicious day, good things come in pairs, blessed and long-lived lovebirds, a hundred generations of prosperity, please welcome the new couple to the hall." These shots form a sharp contrast, highlighting the comedic atmosphere and the tragedy's sorrowfulness more strongly. Moreover, the picture is also relatively beautiful.
	At the same time, from the actors' point of view, from appearance to performance, they generally achieved appropriateness, natural fluency, and did not make people feel pretentious. Here, we can see the praiseworthy efforts of the editors and directors. "Snatching the Bride" is a comedy film worth watching. (Yuan)

    悲剧的喜剧
    不久前，北京的观众满意地欣赏了川剧著名喜剧“拉郎配”，现在又看到了香港凤凰影片公司根据前者改编的彩色古装故事片“抢新郎”。
    生女要拉郎配，本来就是个悲剧，而较之“白头宫女在，闲话说玄宗”的埋藏人生青春、不见天日的悲惨生活，人们还是愿意选择拉郎的下策。所以无怪钱塘县的人看到“选美”皇榜后，不得不展开激烈的“拉郎战”。川剧“拉郎配”以喜剧的形式，幽默地、诙谐地、辛辣地揭露了封建帝王造成的这一人间生离死别的悲剧，讽刺和嘲笑了统治阶级上上下下的百出丑态。“抢新郎”的改编，保存了原作的基本精神，虽然没有采取戏曲形式，却吸取了川剧“拉郎配”的一些优点，同时充分运用了电影艺术的特点，在某些地方较舞台戏还有所发展。
    像县府内成亲一场戏，就非常成功。一面是县官在向催促完成“选美”任务的钦差心腹魏公公说：女儿与李玉的婚事是二十年前指腹为婚；一面却是县官太太在内房用武力劝说捆绑的李玉：“相公！你答应了吧！”一面是李玉在挣扎着喊救命；一边是赞礼司仪在厅堂高呼：“吉日良辰，好事成双，福寿鸳鸯，百世其昌，有请新人出堂。”这些镜头，形成了尖锐的对照，把喜剧的气氛，悲剧之可悲，烘托得更强烈了。而且画面也是比较优美的。
    同时，从演员来说，从外型到表演，一般都做到了恰如其分，自然流利，不使人感到矫揉造作。这里可以看出编导者的值得称赞的努力。“抢新郎”是一部值得看的喜剧片。（沅）
