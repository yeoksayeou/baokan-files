    In Xinba Commune, Yangzhong County, Jiangsu Province, during the days of selling surplus grain, every night, the main roads and small paths leading to the grain station were brightly lit with thousands of lights, and crowds of people and grain-transporting vehicles formed long dragons, with the sounds of gongs and drums and chanting rising one after another. People joyfully sold the best grain to the state. In just eight nights, the commune overfulfilled its task of selling 1.5 million jin of surplus grain. In those days, moving scenes appeared one after another in Xinba Commune.

    Winnowing Wheat with Bellows at Fengxiangzui

    The hot summer sun relentlessly scorched the earth, and the green willow branches hung their heads, motionless. Guo Yifeng, the captain of the ninth production team of the Jianxin Management Area, stared intently at the already threshed wheat. Because there was no wind, he watched helplessly as piles of wheat could not be winnowed and could not be delivered to the warehouse in time. Captain Guo paced anxiously on the threshing ground, and the commune members were as worried as the captain. Female commune member Chen Yunying kept asking the captain, "If we can't winnow the wheat without wind, what will we do with this celebratory grain?" What to do? A commune member who was threshing wheat nearby said half-jokingly, "Zhuge Liang could borrow the east wind, can't we borrow a south wind!"

    "Borrow wind?" Guo Yifeng suddenly thought: the mill uses bellows to winnow rice, why don't we use bellows to winnow wheat. He immediately told his idea to the commune members, and everyone happily said, "Good, this method will definitely work!" Guo Yifeng immediately pulled Guo Xunzhou, Wang Hengying and five other commune members, and immediately carried a bellows from the mill. Everyone hurriedly loaded the threshed wheat into the air box and vigorously turned the bellows. However, wheat is not like rice. The wheat husks are loose and the ears are long. The wheat in the air box could not leak down, but the wind from the bellows mouth was very strong. Guo Yifeng and everyone discussed for a while and decided to change their minds: one person shakes the bellows to "make wind", and the other person uses a dustpan to fill with wheat and stand in front of the bellows mouth to winnow. It worked. The wheat grains and ears were separated into two piles. "This method is really effective!" Immediately, bursts of laughter erupted from the threshing ground.

    The "wind-making and winnowing wheat" method was successfully tested. Guo Yifeng, Guo Xunzhou, Chen Yunying, and Wang Hengying immediately entered the intense battle of winnowing wheat. By midnight, the four had winnowed more than 6,000 jin of wheat. At this time, the captain kindly asked everyone to go home to rest and continue tomorrow, but no one agreed. Chen Yunying said, "Let's work harder tonight and winnow all the wheat, sell the grain tomorrow, and then sleep soundly all night." The four talked and laughed, and worked until dawn, winnowing more than 12,000 jin of wheat. The next day, after another day of sun exposure, the commune members carried and pushed the grain and sent it all to the state granary.

    Selling Good, Selling Enough

    The commune members treated the grain they sold to the state like carefully selected seeds, winnowing it again and again, drying it again and again, and sifting it again and again.

    The old couple, Sun Furen, who are in their sixties from the fifth production team of the Xingxing Management Area, are specifically responsible for drying grain. The first batch of grain transported to the warehouse by the whole team had already been exposed to the sun for two days, but the old couple were still not at ease. The old man said, "We are selling glorious grain, and we can't be careless at all!" The old woman said, "The state's granary is a big granary, and the drier the grain, the better it is preserved. We can't let a pile of chicken droppings ruin a vat of sauce!" After a discussion, the old couple quickly seized a sunny day and exposed the grain to the sun for another day. After inspection by the grain station, the quality of the grain was even better than the national standard.

    The commune members, filled with patriotic enthusiasm, not only sold high-quality grain to the state, but also consciously sold more surplus grain.

    The eleventh production team of the Xinba Management Area originally planned to sell 5,000 jin of surplus grain. After full discussion and careful calculations by all the team members, it was decided to increase it to 11,000 jin, and each team member also retained enough rations, sufficient seed grain, and reserve grain. The team members said, "Last summer, other teams sold surplus grain, and our team was short of grain. The state supplied us with 1,200 jin of grain. This year, we have a bumper harvest, and we have changed from grain shortage to surplus grain. This is all thanks to the good leadership of the Communist Party. When selling surplus grain, we must sell enough. We must not forget the people who planted the trees when we eat the fruit."

    "I also have a share in this glory"

    The crowds of people sending grain flowed like a rolling torrent from all directions to the state grain station, and the elderly could not stay at home.

    The old couple, Wang Yubo, who are in their fifties, were full of energy and insisted on participating in the grain delivery at night. The old man said to the old woman, "You stay home and rest, I'll go send the grain." The old woman refused to agree, "You can go, but I can't? Today we are sending surplus grain, and I also have a share in this glory!" The old man couldn't argue and had to agree to go together. Seeing that the old man agreed, the old woman happily asked, "Should we carry it? Or push it?" "Pushing is better than carrying, a cart can hold 200 jin." As soon as the old man finished speaking, the old woman hurriedly turned around and borrowed a small cart from the farm tool factory and loaded it with wheat.

    The old woman pulled the cart, and the old man pushed the cart, one in front and one behind, and happily walked into the ranks of grain delivery.

    喜气洋溢忙售粮
    新华社记者　姜韦才
    在江苏扬中县新坝公社出售余粮的日子里，每到夜晚，通往粮站的大路和小道，万盏灯火齐明，人群和运粮车辆结成了一条条长龙，锣鼓声和号子声此起彼落。人们欢天喜地把最好的粮食卖给国家。只用八个晚上的时间，全社就超额完成了出售一百五十万斤余粮的任务。在那几天里，动人的情景在新坝公社一幕幕地出现。
    风箱嘴上扬麦粒
    炎夏的太阳死劲地照射着大地，绿色的柳枝垂着头，一动不动。建新管理区第九生产队队长郭义丰，两只眼睛直盯着那已经脱粒的麦子。因为没有风，眼看一堆堆麦子扬不出来，不能及时交售入库。郭队长直急得在麦场上打转转，社员们也像队长一样大伤脑筋。女社员陈云英不时催问队长：“没风扬麦，这喜粮送不出去怎么办？”怎么办？正在一旁打麦的社员半真半假地说：“诸葛亮能借东风，我们就不能借个南风！”
    “借风？”郭义丰猛的一想：碾坊里就是用风箱扬米的，我们何不也用风箱来扬麦子。他马上把自己的想法告诉了社员，大家都高兴地说：“好，这办法准行！”郭义丰就拉了郭训州、王恒英等五个社员，立即从碾坊里抬来一部风箱，大家七手八脚把脱粒的麦子往风斗里装，使劲地转动着风箱。那知，麦子不像稻子，麦壳子松，麦穗子长，风斗里的麦子怎么也漏不下来，而风箱嘴门上的风却很大。郭义丰和大家琢磨一阵，决定改变主意：一个人摇风箱“造风”，一个人用畚箕装满麦子站在风箱嘴门前面簸扬。果然奏效，麦粒和麦穗分成了两处。“这办法真灵！”立时，打麦场上发出了一阵阵欢笑。
    “造风扬麦”的办法试验成功了，郭义丰、郭训州、陈云英、王恒英四人立即投入了扬麦的紧张战斗。到了半夜，四个人扬出了六千多斤麦子。这时，队长关切地要大家回家休息，明天再干，可是谁都不同意。陈云英说：“我们今夜加一把油，把麦子全扬出来，明天卖完了粮再呼呼地睡一个通夜。”四个人有说有笑，一直干到天亮，扬出了一万二千多斤麦子，第二天又曝晒了一天太阳，社员们挑的挑，推的推，全部送进了国家粮库。
    卖得好，卖得足
    社员们把出售给国家的粮食，像精选良种一样，扬了又扬，晒了又晒，筛了又筛。
    星星管理区第五生产队六十多岁的孙富仁老夫妻俩专门负责晒粮。全队第一次运送入库的粮食已经晒了两天好太阳，可是，老两口还不放心。老汉说：“我们这是卖的光荣粮，可不能带一点马虎！”老太太说：“国家的仓库是个大仓库，粮食晒得越干越好保管，可不能让一堆鸡屎坏一缸酱！”老两口一商量，赶紧抢了个晴天，又曝晒了一天太阳。这些粮食经粮站检验，质量比国家规定的标准还好。
    洋溢着爱国主义热情的社员们，不仅把上等的粮食卖给国家，而且都自觉地多卖余粮。
    新坝管理区第十一生产队原来计划出售五千斤余粮。全队社员们经过充分讨论和算细账以后，决定增加到一万一千斤，每个社员还留足了口粮和足够的种籽粮、储备粮。社员们说：“去年夏天，别的队卖余粮，我们队缺粮，国家供应了我们一千二百斤粮食，今年大丰收，我们由缺粮变成余粮，这全靠共产党领导得好，卖余粮，就要卖足，吃果不能忘了栽树人。”
    “这光荣也有我一份”
    送粮的人群像滚滚洪流，从四面八方涌向国家粮站，老年人在家里也呆不住了。
    五十多岁的王玉波老两口浑身是劲，坚决要参加晚上送粮。老汉跟老太太说：“你在家歇歇，我去送粮。”老太太可不答应：“你去得，我就去不得？今天送余粮，这光荣也有我一份！”老汉说不过，只好同意一道去。老太太见老汉答应，高兴地问：“是挑呢？还是推呢？”“推比挑好，一车能装上二百斤。”老汉刚谈完，老太太就急忙转身到农具厂借来了一部小车，装了麦子。
    老太太拉车，老汉推车，一个前，一个后，欢欢喜喜地走进了送粮的行列。
