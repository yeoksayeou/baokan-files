Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 14th: The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan ("Sōhyō") decided on the 13th to carry out the struggle against the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" with even greater force than it used in the struggle against the revision of the "Police Duties Execution Law" last autumn.

At this meeting, "Sōhyō" decided that, in order to oppose the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," its affiliated unions will hold strikes and workplace rallies on June 25th; and that throughout the period from summer to autumn this year, massive strikes will continue to be held.

The Japanese trade union, with 3.5 million members, also decided at the meeting held in Atami City to actively launch educational and propaganda campaigns to let people from all walks of life specifically understand what impact the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" will have on the people.

The meeting also discussed the issue of opposing capitalists' implementation of "enterprise rationalization." The meeting believes that "enterprise rationalization" will cause phenomena such as layoffs and increased labor intensity. The meeting decided to hold strikes and carry out other forms of struggle to oppose capitalists' implementation of this cruel exploitative system.

Xinhua News Agency, June 14th: According to TASS, Takaoka: Under the slogan of "Make the Sea of Japan a Sea of Friendship, Expand Economic Ties between Japan and Neighboring Countries," the 5th National Congress of Cities on the coast of the Sea of Japan Striving to Develop Trade with the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea was held in Takaoka City on the 13th.

Kazuo Suzuki, Managing Director of the Japan-China Trade Promotion Association, said that Japan should refuse to establish a military alliance with the United States and pursue a policy of friendship with China and other socialist countries.

Minoru Tanabe, Managing Director of the Japan-Soviet Trade Promotion Association, emphasized that expanding trade with neighboring countries is of great significance to Japan. He said that the Japanese government should conclude a peace treaty with the Soviet Union, because the absence of a peace treaty seriously hinders the development of normal trade and cultural ties between the Japanese and Soviet peoples.

The participants adopted a resolution on promoting trade with China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, on the exchange of delegations between Japanese and Soviet cities located on the coast of the Sea of Japan, and on the necessity of cooperating with the Soviet Union in developing fishing.

    全力反对日美“安全条约”
    日“总评”决展开罢工运动
    新华社14日讯　东京消息：日本工会总评议会13日决定以比去年秋季进行反对“警察官职务执行法”修正案的斗争所使用的更大的力量，来进行反对修改日美“安全条约”的斗争。
    “总评”在这次会议上决定，为反对日美“安全条约”，它所属的工会将在6月25日举行罢工和工作场所大会；在今年从夏季到秋季这一期间，要继续举行声势浩大的罢工。
    这个拥有三百五十万会员的日本工会在热海市举行的会议上还决定，要积极地展开教育和宣传运动，让各界人民具体地了解新的日美“安全条约”将对人民发生什么样的影响。
    会议还讨论了反对资本家实行“企业合理化”的问题。会议认为，“企业合理化”将引起解雇工人和提高劳动强度等现象。会议决定举行罢工和进行其它方式的斗争，来反对资本家推行这种残酷的剥削制度。
    新华社14日讯　据塔斯社高冈讯：在“使日本海成为友谊海，扩大日本同邻国的经济联系”的口号下，日本海沿岸城市争取同苏联、中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国发展贸易的第五次全国大会13日在高冈市举行。
    日中贸易促进会专务理事铃木一雄说，日本应当拒绝同美国建立军事联盟，执行同中国和其他社会主义国家友好的政策。
    日苏贸易促进会专务理事田边稔着重指出，扩大同邻国的贸易对日本具有重大意义。他说，日本政府应当同苏联缔结和约，因为没有和约严重地妨碍着日本和苏联人民之间的正常的贸易和文化联系的发展。
    与会者通过了一项关于促进同中国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国发展贸易、关于日本和苏联位于日本海沿岸城市互派代表团、关于在发展捕渔方面必须同苏联合作的决议。
