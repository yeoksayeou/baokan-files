Xinhua News Agency, Prague, June 15th (Reporters Yang Yi and Lin Hai report): Since this spring, Czechoslovakia has seen a new situation of great development in agricultural production. The Czechoslovak Communist Party Central Committee's call at its March plenary session to "strive for a fundamental improvement in agricultural production" has been warmly responded to by all working people. Farmers have taken many concrete measures and are determined to work hard to complete this year's agricultural production increase target of 12%.

Since the beginning of this year, more than one hundred new agricultural production cooperatives have been established in Czechoslovakia, bringing the total number of cooperatives in the country to nearly twelve thousand three hundred. Agricultural production cooperatives are now distributed in more than 80% of the country's rural areas. The cultivated area of the cooperatives accounts for about 75% of the country's total cultivated area.

Since the beginning of spring this year, farmers have changed the shortcomings of not strictly observing the farming season in the past, and have carried out spring plowing and sowing work in a timely manner. They even went to the fields on Sundays and during Easter, so that the grain sowing plan was completed almost a month earlier than last year, and the quality of plowing and sowing also exceeded that of previous years. This has created good conditions for this year's agricultural production increase. At present, rural areas are emphasizing field management, and many areas have launched competitions for this purpose, raising the target for grain yield per unit area.

Czechoslovakia's rural areas are also vigorously carrying out water conservancy construction and soil improvement work. In the past, only 10% of the land in Czechoslovakia's rural areas was drained, and 5% of the land was irrigated. This year, many agricultural cooperatives have jointly established soil improvement cooperatives to jointly invest in the construction of water conservancy projects. Up to now, about two hundred soil improvement cooperatives have been established in various places.

This year, in addition to increasing the amount of chemical fertilizers supplied to rural areas, the government also emphasized the use of natural fertilizers. Since last winter and this spring, a fertilizer accumulation campaign has been launched throughout the country. Animal manure, beet dregs, river mud, and other materials that have not been valued for many years have been utilized this year.

The prevention and control of plant diseases and insect pests is also one of the important measures taken in agriculture this year. Rural areas all over the country are using large amounts of effective chemical agents to prevent and control plant diseases and insect pests to ensure this year's bumper harvest.

The Czechoslovak government's decision to sell the machinery of machine tractor stations to agricultural cooperatives has also been implemented smoothly. By mid-April, cooperatives across the country had purchased more than 10,000 tractors, which has played a significant role in solving the problem of labor shortage in rural areas.

The new situation in agricultural production is the result of the Czechoslovak Communist Party Central Committee and party organizations at all levels personally taking action and mobilizing the whole people to run agriculture. Responsible cadres of many state party committees personally went to various cooperatives to guide their work, and rural party organizations also strengthened their leadership over the cooperatives. In order to further enhance the role of the party in rural areas, the Czechoslovak Communist Party has also strengthened the work of developing and cultivating new party members in rural areas, especially in cooperatives, this year.

Under the call of the Czechoslovak Communist Party Central Committee, a large number of agricultural experts have gone to rural areas to guide production. Agricultural scientific workers have also held various meetings to actively respond to the party's call, overcome the shortcomings of separating scientific research from practical needs, and actively help rural areas to use and promote various new agricultural technologies. The Youth League and the Women's Federation have also mobilized and organized young people and women to actively participate in agricultural labor. Industrial departments have proposed to provide more machinery, fertilizers and other materials for rural areas to support agricultural production.

In the southern region of Czechoslovakia, some pastures need to be drained. Therefore, agricultural production cooperatives in this region are currently vigorously carrying out soil and water improvement work.

    捷共中央和各级党组织发动全民办农业
    捷克斯洛伐克今春农业大发展
    新华社布拉格15日电　本社记者杨翊、林海报道：今年春天以来捷克斯洛伐克出现了一个农业生产大发展的新局面。捷克斯洛伐克共产党3月中央全会提出的“争取农业生产根本好转”的号召已得到了全体劳动人民的热烈响应。农民们采取了许多具体措施，坚决为完成今年农业生产增产12％的指标而努力。
    今年以来，捷克斯洛伐克又新成立了一百多个农业生产合作社，使全国合作社总数接近一万二千三百个。现在农业生产合作社已分布在全国80％以上的农村中。合作社的耕地面积占全国耕地总面积的75％左右。
    今年开春以来，农民们改变了过去不严格遵守农时的缺点，及时进行了春耕春播的工作，甚至星期日和复活节期间也下地干活，使谷种播种计划比去年几乎提早一个月完成，耕播的质量也超过往年。这就为今年的农业增产创造了良好的条件。目前农村中正强调做好田间管理工作，许多地区并为此展开竞赛，提高了粮食单位面积产量的指标。
    捷克斯洛伐克农村中还大力进行兴修水利、改良土壤的工作。过去捷克斯洛伐克农村中只有10％的土地进行排水，5％的土地进行灌溉。今年许多农业合作社纷纷联合成立了土壤改良合作社，共同投资兴建水利工程。到目前为止，各地已成立了约二百个土壤改良合作社。
    今年政府除了提高供应农村化学肥料的数量外，还强调使用自然肥料。去冬今春以来在全国范围内开展了一个积肥运动，多年不受重视的畜粪、甜菜渣滓、河泥等今年都被利用起来。
    防治病虫害也是今年农业上采取的重要措施之一。全国各地农村正大量使用有效的化学药剂防治病虫害，以确保今年的丰收。
    捷克斯洛伐克政府关于把机器拖拉机站的机器出售给农业合作社的决定也执行得很顺利。到4月中旬为止，全国合作社已购买了一万多台拖拉机，这对解决农村劳动力不足的困难起了很大作用。
  农业生产中所出现的新局面是捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央和各级党组织亲自动手并发动全民办农业的结果。许多州的党委负责干部都亲自到各地合作社指导工作，农村党组织也加强了对合作社的领导。为了进一步增强党在农村中的作用，捷克斯洛伐克共产党今年还在农村、特别是在合作社中加强了发展和培养新党员的工作。
    在捷共中央的号召下，大批农业专家已分赴农村指导生产。农业科学工作者并召开各种会议，积极响应党的号召，克服科学研究与实际需要脱节的缺点，积极帮助农村运用和推广各种新的农业技术。青年联盟和妇女联合会也动员和组织青年和妇女积极参加农业劳动。工业部门提出要为农村提供更多的机器、肥料和其他物资，来支援农业生产。
    在捷克斯洛伐克南部地区，有一部分牧场需要排水，因此，这个地区的农业生产合作社目前正在大力进行水土改良工作。图为布捷金茨区罗乌德纳村的合作社社员们使用机器掘沟铺设排水管的情况。
    普罗斯捷夫区杜班内村的农业生产合作社因为生产好，荣获劳动勋章。图为社员阿涅什卡·德劳乌卡在牧放小牛。
