Education Combined with Production, Rational Arrangement of Time
    Shaanxi Construction Engineering Bureau Persists in Spare-Time Education

    (Our newspaper reporter Li Qian reports) The Shaanxi Provincial Construction Engineering Bureau's various construction and installation enterprises, due to the combination of education and production and the rational arrangement of time, have achieved great results in employee education over the past three years, eliminating illiteracy and promoting production. Recently, the Ministry of Construction Engineering and the National Committee of the Construction Trade Union jointly held an on-site meeting on employee education in the construction industry in Xi'an to promote the experiences of this enterprise.

    Persisting in Eliminating Illiteracy for Three Years

    The leading cadres of the Shaanxi Provincial Construction Engineering System's fourteen companies and affiliated enterprises were mostly from worker-peasant backgrounds or transferred from the military, with relatively low levels of education. Before 1956, many were unfamiliar with construction work, and some couldn't even understand blueprints, which made it difficult to lead modern industrial construction. At that time, the majority of workers were from rural areas, with widespread illiteracy and low technical skills. Many workers failed to meet quotas, and quality accidents occurred frequently. In order to complete the tasks assigned by the Party in a faster, better, and more economical way, the Bureau Party Committee decided in 1956 to establish spare-time cultural schools for employees in its affiliated enterprises. Since then, the companies have persisted in employee spare-time education. By 1958, illiteracy had been completely eliminated among the more than 60,000 workers in the bureau system. Subsequently, 109 spare-time schools combining politics, technology, and culture were established, organizing more than 65,000 people to participate in learning.

    Adapting to Characteristics, Running Schools at Different Levels

    It is not easy for various construction and installation enterprises to persist in employee education, because the construction companies' sites are scattered, and the workers have high mobility. After the completion of a building, they have to move to a new site. At the new site, workers are always busy building sheds, arranging accommodation, and preparing for work, and cannot immediately start classes. Some companies also run schools by work areas, but because the work sections under each work area are too far apart, many employees do not have the opportunity to study. The Bureau Party Committee repeatedly studied these situations and decided that under the unified leadership of the Party committees at all levels, schools should be run at different levels with the work section as the unit. This would both give play to the enthusiasm of grassroots units and the broad masses and ensure that employees would not have their studies interrupted due to relocation, so that schools would be located wherever the construction site was located, and a newly opened construction site could start school before starting work. The Third Construction Engineering Company also stipulated that when the labor and wage departments handle transfer procedures for employees, they should also handle transfer procedures for schools. In this way, workers who are transferred to a new work section can participate in learning the next day. Therefore, the attendance rate of students in the company's spare-time school has consistently remained above 90%.

    Relying on the Masses to Improve Teaching

    The Party committees of the construction companies in Shaanxi Province also pay special attention to relying on the masses, making unified arrangements, and combining the use of spare time based on the characteristics of the construction industry to ensure the normal progress of employee spare-time education. The Second Work Area of the Third Construction Company gave the task of how to guarantee study time to the masses for discussion. Through debate, the masses carefully calculated the use of time and found out the repetitive and unreasonable aspects of previous time usage. Therefore, the Party Committee decided to make unified arrangements and comprehensively utilize spare time. An office composed of the Party, government, labor union, and youth league leaders of the work area was established to make unified arrangements for learning and various activities every half month, so that various activities were organically combined, avoiding the phenomenon of competition and squeezing of spare time.

    In persisting in employee spare-time education, the construction companies in Shaanxi Province continuously summarize experiences and lessons, mobilize the masses to reform the teaching content and teaching methods, and try to make education adapt to the characteristics of construction workers, so as to combine production and serve the central work and politics. In order to solve the problem of applying what is learned, the Party committees of the First Construction Company and the Third Construction Company successively mobilized the masses to make suggestions on the old textbooks and organized the masses to compile their own textbooks. When compiling technical course materials, they mainly mobilized veteran technicians and on-site construction technical cadres to summarize construction operation experience, compiled a preliminary draft, and then organized cadres from production, safety, technology and other departments to jointly sort out and review it. Some textbooks also invited teachers from the architectural college to help review and finalize the plans. In terms of language courses, good articles reflecting the lives and ideological changes of construction workers were selected, such as the articles "Fifty Years as a Bricklayer" and "Taking on Apprentices" in the language textbooks, which construction workers found very intimate. In the arithmetic textbooks, a large number of application problems were compiled using actual materials from the construction site and the numbers of the Great Leap Forward in Production. Workers can immediately apply what they learned to production.

    Improving Culture Promotes Production

    Due to the persistence in spare-time education, currently, among the employees of enterprises under the Shaanxi Provincial Construction Engineering Bureau, 46% have a primary school education, 25% have a junior high school education, and 13.2% have a senior high school education or above. The improvement of the cultural level of employees has greatly promoted technological innovation and promoted production development. The workers in the carpentry workshop of the Third Work Section of the Second Work Area of the Third Construction Company were all illiterate. Now they all have a senior elementary or junior high school education. The workers apply what they have learned from the mechanics section and the calculation methods for motor speed changes to technological innovation, and have manufactured many indigenous machines, which have turned the woodworking production process from manual operation to mechanization, greatly reducing workers' physical labor and improving production efficiency.

    教育结合生产　合理安排时间
    陕西建筑工程局坚持业余教育
    本报讯　记者李茜报道：陕西省建筑工程局各建筑安装企业由于教育结合生产，合理安排时间，三年多来，职工教育取得很大成绩，扫除了文盲，推动了生产。最近，建筑工程部和建筑工会全国委员会联合在西安召开了建筑业职工教育现场会议，推广这个企业的经验。
    坚持三年扫除文盲
    陕西省建筑工程系统局十四个公司和附属企业的领导干部，大都是工农出身或部队转业来的，文化水平比较低，1956年以前，很多人对建筑业务不熟悉，甚至连图纸也看不懂，领导现代化的工业建筑有很多困难。当时工人中，多数来自农村，文盲多，技术低，不少工人达不到定额，质量事故也不断发生。为了多快好省地完成党交给的任务，1956年，局党委决定所属各企业开办职工业余文化学校。从那时起，各公司一直坚持着职工业余教育，到1958年，该局系统六万多工人中全部扫除了文盲。接着，办起了政治、技术、文化三结合的职工业余学校一百零九所，组织六万五千多人参加学习。
    适应特点分级办学
    各建筑安装企业坚持职工教育是很不容易的，因为建筑公司的工地分散，工人的流动性又很大，建筑物完工后，又要搬到新的工地上去。在新的工地，工人总是忙着搭工棚、安排食宿、准备开工等，不能立刻上课；还有些公司是由工区办学，因工区所属各工段离工区太远，很多职工没有机会学习。局党委反复研究了这些情况，决定在各级党委统一领导下，以工段为单位分级办学，这样既可以发挥基层单位和广大群众的积极性，又可以保证职工不因搬家中断学习，做到工地到那里，学校到那里，一个新开辟的工地，没有开工，也可以先开学。第三建筑工程公司还规定劳资部门给职工办理调动工作的手续时，一起办理转学手续。这样，调到新工段的工人第二天就能参加学习，因此，该公司业余学校的学生出席率一直保持在90％以上。
    依靠群众改进教学
    陕西省各建筑公司党委，还特别注意根据建筑业的特点，依靠群众，统一安排，结合利用业余时间，以保证职工业余教育正常进行。第三建筑公司二工区，把如何保证学习时间问题，交给群众讨论，群众通过鸣放辩论，在时间安排上算细账，找出了以往在使用时间上重复和不合理的地方。于是党委确定统一安排，综合利用业余时间，由工区党、政、工、团领导人员组成了一个办公室，每半月对学习和各项活动进行一次统一安排，使各项活动有机地结合起来，避免了对业余时间互争互挤的现象。
    陕西省各建筑公司在坚持职工业余教育中，不断总结经验教训，发动群众对教学内容和教学方法进行改革，尽量使教育适应建筑职工的特点，做到结合生产，为中心工作和政治服务。为了解决学以致用问题，第一建筑公司和第三建筑公司党委先后发动群众对旧教材提意见，并组织群众自己编教材。在编写技术课教材时，主要发动老技工和现场施工技术干部，总结施工操作经验，编成初稿，再组织生产、安全、技术等部门的干部共同整理审查，有些教材还请建筑学院的教师们帮助审查定案。在语文课方面，选用了反映建筑工人生活、思想变化的好文章，如语文教材中选用了“瓦工五十年”、“带徒弟”等文章，建筑工人读起来非常亲切；在算术教材上，选用了工地上的实际材料和生产大跃进的数字，编写了大量的应用题，工人学习了就能马上应用到生产上去。
    提高文化推动生产
    由于坚持了业余教育，目前，陕西省建筑工程局所属企业单位的职工中，具有小学文化程度的占46％，初中程度的25％，高中以上程度的13.2％。职工文化水平的提高，大大促进了技术革新，推动了生产发展。第三建筑公司二工区三工段细木车间工人，原来都是文盲，现在都具有高小或初中文化程度。工人们把学到的力学部分和马达变速的计算方法等，运用到技术革新中去，制造了很多土机器，使木工的生产过程由手工操作变成机械化，大大减轻了工人的体力劳动，提高了生产效率。
