Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, 31st May: According to Iraqi radio reports, Iraqi peace fighters held a peace conference in Hilla, a city 100 kilometers south of Baghdad, on May 29th. Approximately 250,000 representatives and people from all over the country attended the conference.

The conference unanimously adopted a resolution expressing its full support for the resolution recently passed by the World Peace Council at its special meeting in Stockholm; hoping that the East-West foreign ministers' meeting in Geneva will reach an agreement on the German question, especially the Berlin question, and resolve international disputes peacefully, reaching a complete agreement on the cessation of nuclear weapons testing and preparing for a summit meeting; declaring that they stand with the heroic Republic of Iraq, supporting the people's struggle for peace and defending the Republic of Iraq; fully supporting the struggle of the Algerian people, the Omani people and the South Arabian people for liberation, democracy and peace; condemning imperialism's conspiracy to conclude a new "Mediterranean Pact" to replace the bankrupt Baghdad Pact; condemning the United Arab Republic authorities' suppression of freedom and persecution of peace fighters.

Aziz Sharif, Secretary-General of the National Committee of Iraqi Peace Fighters, delivered a speech at the meeting. He expounded on the democratic path followed by the Republic of Iraq, which was also the result of the Iraqi people's long-term struggle. He said that we, the peace fighters who once put forward the slogan of "Peace and Defending the Republic," see that the biggest danger facing Iraq today is the conspiracy to divide our united ranks.

The Iranian peace delegation was warmly welcomed upon arriving at the conference venue. Representatives of the delegation, in their speeches, condemned the U.S. imperialism's bilateral military agreement with the Iranian authorities as a violation of the wishes of the Iranian people.

Colonel Ismail Makki spoke on behalf of the Iraqi Army. He praised the Iraqi peace fighters for dedicating themselves to the realization of world peace. He said that the agents of imperialism cannot divide our ranks, and we must unite to crush the conspirators who serve the interests of imperialism. He added that the Iraqi people will never accept humiliation and surrender, and they will persist in their struggle under the leadership of Prime Minister Qasim.
