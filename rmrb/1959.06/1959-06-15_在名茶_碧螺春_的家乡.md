In the Home of the Famous Tea "Biluochun"
By our reporter Tian Lin

Recently, I, as a reporter, came to the Dongting People's Commune in Dongshan Town, on the eastern edge of Taihu Lake, the home of the famous tea "Biluochun," for an interview. Unexpectedly, I saw a very enchanting scene of a comprehensive bumper harvest in summer. If described in verse, it would be:

\tDongting in May shines with gold,
\tLoquat and wheat fields reflect in yellow,
\tSilkworms happily spin their cocoons,
\tBiluochun sends forth fragrance for ten miles.

Dongting Dongshan, the location of the Dongting People's Commune, belongs to Wu County, Jiangsu Province. It is surrounded by the lake on three sides and connected to Suzhou on one side. Truly, everywhere is verdant mountains, clear waters, willows, and bright flowers. People who come here feel as if they are in a painting, and they themselves become figures in the painting.

However, what is most beautiful and moving here is not the uniquely favorable natural environment, but the picture of a comprehensive bumper harvest painted by the commune members through their diligent labor last winter and this spring.

\tSilkworms Mature, Loquats Turn Yellow

This is precisely the season for picking loquats. The reporter followed the commune members who were picking loquats up the high mountains, and saw continuous mountain ranges with orchards densely packed like forests, blocking out the sun. The most numerous fruit trees are loquats, oranges, waxberries, and green plums. According to the agricultural proverb, the season here is: "Silkworms mature, loquats turn yellow," "Summer solstice, waxberries turn the mountains red." Now, it is the time when silkworms are spinning their cocoons, and the summer solstice will arrive in a few days, so the green plums are nearing "childbirth," and the loquats are even more golden and dazzling, making people drool. As the commune members carried basket after basket of loquats down the mountain, the reporter heard bursts of joyous songs and laughter rising from under the loquat trees and on the narrow mountain paths.

The commune's leading comrades told the reporter that this year's loquat harvest is a great success, and it is estimated that they can harvest 20,000 dan (1 dan = 50 kg). The green plum trees are also full of fruit, and a bumper harvest is in sight.

On the plains, there is an endless yellow ocean, which is the mature rapeseed and wheat. The tall ones reach the chest, and the short ones are at least waist-high. No matter which rapeseed field you enter, it is like entering a shrub forest; and when you approach the wheat fields planted with "dwarf grain" or "Fang Liuzhu," you can't help but be amazed by the thickness of the wheat stalks and the neat, large ears of wheat.

Comrades who love to drink tea are probably familiar with the name "Biluochun." This is a precious high-grade green tea. After steeping in water, all the tea leaves are tender and green, with a mellow and fragrant taste. Even without using boiling water, the tea leaves will all unfurl and sink to the bottom. "Biluochun" is mainly harvested and produced in the spring. Before steeping in water, the shape is slightly curled, which is very beautiful.

"Biluochun" tea is now produced in many places, but this place – Dongting Dongshan and Xishan – is its hometown. Last year, the Dongting People's Commune produced a total of 6,600 jin (1 jin = 0.5 kg) of "Biluochun" tea. This year, in the spring alone, they have already produced more than 8,000 jin, exceeding the state's purchase quota for spring tea.

In this commune, almost every family raises silkworms. Whether on the main streets or in the alleys, the reporter saw adults and children carrying, carrying on their backs, or dragging bundles and carts of mulberry leaves. In everyone's home, even in the commune's office, the ground was piled with mulberry leaves, and the shelves were filled with bamboo trays containing silkworms. The fat silkworms were moving and munching on the tender green leaves in the trays.

A silkworm-raising girl picked up a thick, fat silkworm from her palm and said to the reporter, "Look, it's fully three inches long!" According to the commune's leading comrades' estimate, the first batch of 4,000 sheets of silkworm eggs currently spinning their cocoons can produce about 3,000 dan of cocoons, which is an average of more than a dozen jin of cocoons per sheet more than last year's spring cocoons.

\t"Climbing to a Higher Level"

One evening, the reporter found the production statistics and planning figures of this commune for the past few years in the commune Party committee's office. Let's take the harvest figures of several major products in the previous year, last year, and this year for comparison. For the 6,700 mu of fruit orchards, 45,000 dan were harvested in the previous year, 69,000 dan were harvested last year, and it is planned to harvest 100,000 dan this year. Judging from the current bumper harvest of loquats and waxberries and the growth of oranges and green plums, this goal is achievable. Silkworm cocoons yielded more than 3,700 dan in the previous year and more than 4,300 dan last year, and this year's production is also expected to exceed last year's. Fish production has also increased year after year.

However, people are not satisfied with this year's production scale, and they are striving to "climb to a higher level," and are now paving the way for continuous leaps forward in the future. The Dongting Commune has great potential to be tapped. The entire commune has 73,000 mu of land, but currently only 37,000 mu are being cultivated. The commune's leading comrades said that they have already begun planning to further develop diversified operations, so that the commune's production will be better year by year, and the lives of the commune members will be richer year by year. The goal is to achieve full ponds of fish, full granaries of grain, flowers and fruits all over the hills, machines sounding everywhere, and men and women singing together, making socialism a paradise.

From last year to now, the Dongting Commune has planned to reduce the harvesting of tea leaves and tea seeds in a planned way, on the one hand, pruning branches and cultivating seedlings, and on the other hand, sowing tea seeds, to develop tea fields on a large scale. They are also vigorously developing mulberry trees to raise more silkworms. At present, the commune already has 400 mu of tea seedling nurseries and 1,200 mu of mulberry seedling nurseries. In the last winter and this spring alone, more than 20,000 mu of timber forest and economic forest nurseries have been developed. In addition, they will also develop agricultural and sideline product processing, agricultural tool industry, and handicrafts appropriately according to the labor situation.

\tHow Does the Bumper Harvest Come About?

This year's harvest is not particularly better than last year or the year before. Why is it possible to achieve a comprehensive bumper harvest this year? Is this year's bumper loquat harvest due to the so-called "big year" of fruit trees? However, the figures from the previous year dispelled this suspicion. It was also a big year, with the same number of loquat trees, but the harvest in the previous year was less than 10,000 dan. The main reason for this year's bumper loquat harvest is that after communization, the enthusiasm of the commune members has been greatly improved, and they have resolutely taken anti-frost measures, avoiding the phenomenon of flower drop that caused reduced production. Moreover, this year, the loquat trees were also fertilized particularly heavily.

The silkworm-raising girls are most worried about silkworms getting sick and dying. This year, their brows are smoothed out, because they have found that the main reason why silkworms get sick in the past is because they ate wet mulberry leaves. This year, the commune closely cooperated with the Wu County meteorological post. As soon as there was rain, the meteorological post notified the commune, and the commune immediately mobilized people to rush to harvest mulberry leaves. Therefore, this year's spring silkworms have never eaten wet mulberry leaves. The silkworm-raising girls also carefully controlled the indoor temperature, just like gentle nursery workers taking care of babies. They also often used penicillin to "supplement" the silkworms' food, to prevent diseases.

The wheat and rapeseed fields of this commune are growing relatively densely. According to the commune members' inspection, there are about 20,000 rapeseed plants per mu, which is more than twice as many as in the past. Of course, more fertilizer was also applied than in previous years. It is said that more than 3,000 jin of farm manure was applied to each mu of wheat.

The leadership of the Party, the superiority of the commune, the soaring enthusiasm of the people, the implementation of the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture... these are the main factors of the bumper harvest. (Attached picture)

    在名茶“碧螺春”的家乡
    本报记者　田林
    记者最近因访问名茶“碧螺春”的家乡，来到太湖东部边上的东山镇洞庭人民公社。出乎意料，在这里看到了一幅十分迷人的夏季全面丰收的景象。如果用诗描写的话，这恰是：
    洞庭五月闪金光，
    麦海枇杷相映黄，
    簇上春蚕欢作茧，
    碧螺十里送芬芳。
    洞庭东山，洞庭人民公社的所在地，属江苏省吴县。这里三面滨湖，一面和苏州连接。真是到处山青水秀，柳暗花明。人到这里就如置身画中，自己也成画中人了。
    然而，这里最美丽最动人的还不是得天独厚的自然环境，而是经过公社社员去冬今春辛勤劳动描绘出来的全面丰收的图画。
      蚕老枇杷黄
    这正是采摘枇杷的季节。记者跟随采枇杷的社员登上高山，只见接连不断的群山上，一片片的果树，遮天蔽日，密如森林。果树中最多的是枇杷、桔子、杨梅和青梅。按照农谚，这里的节令是：“蚕老枇杷黄”，“夏至杨梅满山红”。现在正当春蚕上簇，夏至过几天也要到来的时候，所以，春梅已近“临产”，枇杷更是金光闪闪，令人垂涎。当社员们把一大筐一大筐的枇杷运下山来时，记者听到在枇杷树下和羊肠小道上，腾起了一阵阵欢乐的歌声和笑声。
    公社的负责同志告诉记者，今年枇杷大丰收，估计可以收到两万担。青梅树上也都结得满满的，丰收在望。
    在平原上，荡漾着一望无际的黄色海洋，这是已经成熟了的油菜和小麦，她们高的达到胸部，低的也与腰部相齐。无论你走进那一块油菜田，都像是走进灌木林里一样；而当你走近种“矮粒多”或者是“方六柱”的麦田时，你又不得不为麦秆的粗壮和麦穗的整齐肥大而感到惊奇。
    爱喝茶的同志对“碧螺春”这个名字，大概都不陌生。这是一种名贵的高级绿茶，在泡水以后，全是又嫩又绿的小叶，味醇清香，即使不用开水冲，茶叶也会全部展开沉底。“碧螺春”主要是在春天采摘和制作，在未泡水之前，外形略带卷曲，很好看。
    “碧螺春”茶现在有好些地方都会制作，但是这儿——洞庭东山和西山却是它的故乡。去年全年，洞庭人民公社共产“碧螺春”茶六千六百斤，今年只是春季就已经生产了八千多斤，超额完成了国家收购春茶的任务。
    在这个公社里，几乎家家都养蚕。无论在大街小巷，记者都看见大人、小孩挑着、背着或拖着一捆一车的桑叶。无论在谁家，甚至就是在公社办公的地方，也看见地下堆的是桑叶，架子上摆的是装蚕的竹匾，肥大的蚕儿正一动一动地在匾里咬吃着嫩绿的叶片。
    一个养蚕的姑娘随手捻起一条又粗又肥的蚕放在手掌上，对记者说：“你看，足足有三寸长！”据公社负责同志估计，目前正在上簇的第一批四千张种的蚕，可以产茧三千担左右，比去年的春茧，平均每张种可以多产茧十几斤。
    “更上一层楼”
    一天晚上，记者在公社党委办公的地方，翻到了这个公社几年来有关生产的统计和计划数字。就拿几种主要产品在前年、去年和今年的收获数字来作一些对比吧。水果六千七百亩地，前年收四万五千担，去年收六万九千担，今年计划要收十万担。从目前枇杷、杨梅丰收的情况和桔子、青梅等生长的情况来看是有把握的。蚕茧，前年三千七百多担，去年四千三百多担，今年还可以超过去年。鱼也连年增产。
    然而人们并不因为有了今年的生产规模而感到满足，他们争取“更上一层楼”，现在正为今后继续不断的跃进铺平道路。洞庭公社有很大的潜力可以挖掘。全社共有土地七万三千亩，目前经营的不过三万七千亩。公社的负责同志说，他们已经着手规划进一步地发展多种经营，使公社的生产一年比一年更好，社员的生活一年比一年更富裕。要做到鱼满塘，粮满仓，花果遍山岗，机器到处响，男男女女齐歌唱，社会主义胜天堂。
    从去年到现在，洞庭公社就有计划的少采一部分茶叶，少收一部分茶籽，一方面剪枝育苗，一方面撒播茶种，来大规模的发展茶田。他们又在大力发展桑树，以便多多养蚕。目前，公社已经有茶苗圃四百亩，桑苗圃一千二百亩了。只去冬今春，发展了用材林和经济林苗圃两万多亩。此外，他们还要根据劳力情况，适当地发展农副产品加工业、农具工业和手工艺等。
    丰收怎样来？
    今年的年景和去年、前年比较，也并不特别好。为什么今年就能够获得全面大丰收呢？今年枇杷大丰收，是不是碰到了水果树的所谓“大年”的缘故呢？可是，前年的数字打消了这种怀疑。同样是大年，同样多的枇杷树，而前年收的还不到一万担。今年枇杷大丰收，主要在于公社化以后，社员积极性大大提高，坚决采取了防冻措施，避免了造成减产的落花现象。而且今年枇杷树肥料也上得特别多。
    养蚕姑娘们最耽心的是蚕闹病造成死亡。今年她们的眉头舒展了，因为找到了过去蚕闹病的主要原因是吃了湿桑叶。今年，公社和吴县气象哨紧密配合，一有雨情，气象哨就通知公社，公社立即调动人马突击采桑。因此，今年的春蚕从来没有吃过湿桑叶。养蚕的姑娘们还像温柔的保育员照顾婴儿一样，细心地掌握室内的温度。他们还常用青霉素给蚕“添食”，预防疾病。
    这个公社的麦田和油菜田，都长得比较密。据社员们检查，油菜每亩约有两万棵，比过去多两倍以上。肥料当然也比往年上得多。据说，每亩小麦只厩肥就上了三千多斤。
    党的领导、公社的优越性、人们冲天的干劲、农业八字宪法的贯彻执行……，这就是丰收的主要因素。（附图片）
