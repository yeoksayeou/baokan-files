    The major rivers in Guangdong Province are the West River, North River, and East River. These three rivers are collectively known as the Pearl River (what is now referred to as the Pearl River is actually just the section from Guangzhou to Humen).

    Both the West River, North River and East River have flood control dikes along their banks. Guangzhou is located to the east of the North River. If a breach occurs in the dike on the east bank of the North River, Guangzhou will be flooded.

    The West River enters the province from Wuzhou, Guangxi, and traverses the central part of the province; the North River enters from Hunan Province and flows from north to south. The West River and North River meet at Sixianjiao in Sanshui County, west of Guangzhou, and then divide into many tributaries, forming the Pearl River Delta river network. The main stream of the North River flows into the South China Sea through the Hongqi River, and the main stream of the West River flows into the South China Sea through the Modao Men. The East River flows into Guangdong from Jiangxi, flowing from east to southwest, passing through Huiyang, Boluo, Dongguan and other counties, and enters the sea at Humen. When the main streams and countless tributaries of these three rivers flow into the sea, the Pearl River Delta is formed due to silt deposition. The delta has a dense network of rivers and streams. In order to protect their homes, farmers built many large and small dikes in this water network in the past. There are approximately five to six million mu of fertile farmland here, a large granary in southern China, comparable to the Yangtze River Delta and the vicinity of Dongting Lake, and can be called a land of fish and rice.

    广东境内的主要河流
    广东省境内的主要河流是西江、北江、东江，这三江又总称珠江（现在称作珠江的，实际上只是从广州到虎门的一段）。
    西江、北江和东江两岸，都有防护洪水的堤防。广州市在北江东边，北江东岸大堤如果出险，洪水就会淹浸广州。
    西江从广西梧州入境，横贯省内中部；北江由湖南省入境，从北南流。西江和北江流到广州西部的三水县思贤滘时相遇，然后分成许多支流，组成珠江三角洲河网区。北江主流由洪奇河、西江主流由磨刀门注入南海。东江由江西流入广东，从东向西南流，经惠阳、博罗、东莞等县，由虎门入海。这三江的主流和无数支流入海时，因为泥沙沉淀形成了珠江三角洲。三角洲上江河纵横密布，农民为保卫家乡，从前便在这水网中建了许多大大小小的堤围。这里约有五、六百万亩丰饶肥美的农田，是祖国南方的大粮仓，可以和长江三角洲、洞庭湖滨相媲美，称得上是鱼米之乡。
