Xinhua News Agency, New York, June 3rd (TASS dispatch): American workers are engaged in a tenacious strike struggle. According to preliminary statistics from the U.S. Department of Labor, in the first quarter of 1959, there were 975 strikes in the United States, involving 440,000 people.

For six and a half months, textile workers in the small city of Henderson, North Carolina, have been waging a tenacious struggle against business owners. Eleven hundred workers have been guarding the gates of the city's two largest textile mills, "Harriet and Henderson Cotton Mills," day and night to defend their rights.

For fourteen years, the Textile Workers Union of America (the strikers are members of this union) has signed a number of collective contracts with the company. Last year, the company refused to renew a past contract and demanded the abolition of the clause in the contract that stipulated workers' right to make demands to the administration. It also insisted on including a clause prohibiting strikes in the contract.

The strike of 33,000 rubber industry workers in Akron, Ohio, has entered its second month. The union is demanding improved working conditions.

    美国工人斗争浪潮此伏彼起
    今年第一季度罢工近一千次
    新华社讯　据塔斯社纽约3日讯：美国工人正在进行顽强的罢工斗争。据美国劳工部初步统计，1959年第一季度，美国发生罢工九百七十五次，参加罢工的人数达四十四万人。
    六个半月以来，在美国北卡罗来纳州汉德逊这座不大的城市，纺织工人同企业主一直进行着顽强的斗争。一千一百名工人为了维护自己的权利，夜以继日地守卫着这个城市中“加勒特和汉德逊棉花公司”两家最大纺织厂的大门。
    十四年以来，纺织工业工人工会（罢工者是这个工会的成员）同公司签订了多项集体合同。去年，公司拒绝恢复过去的一项合同，并且要求废除合同中规定工人有权向行政提出要求的条款，而且还坚持要把禁止举行罢工的条款列入合同。
    阿克伦（俄亥俄州）三万三千名橡胶工业工人的罢工已经进入第二个月。工会要求改善劳动条件。
