    Comprehensively Improve the Quality of Converter Steel

    Qingdao City has converted its acidic converter steelmaking equipment into alkaline steelmaking equipment. It used high-sulfur iron to produce steel that was almost entirely qualified (referring only to sulfur content), with first-class products (sulfur content below 0.055%) accounting for over 80%. This matter needs to be brought to the attention of comrades on the iron and steel front.

    Adopting alkaline converter steelmaking is not a new experience. However, why is it that Qingdao City has been able to achieve better results using this method, while some places have not adopted it or have not fully adopted it? It is said that there are many objective or subjective reasons: there are issues with the materials needed to改造converter equipment, and there are technical issues with mastering alkaline steelmaking equipment, etc. How should these issues be addressed? One way is to make the greatest determination, regard the reform of steelmaking equipment as an important link in improving the quality and output of converter steel, and firmly grasp this link; mobilize all employees to offer suggestions and solve the required materials, while also transferring specialized personnel to learn to use alkaline steelmaking equipment. After gaining experience through pilot projects, it should be quickly promoted. The steelmaking workers in Qingdao City used this method to improve the quality of steel. However, there are also some enterprises that are waiting for favorable conditions, waiting for the sulfur content of pig iron from small blast furnaces to decrease, and not taking effective measures in converter steel (such as using alkaline hot blast stoves for desulfurization). This is obviously wrong. Of course, without a doubt, small blast furnaces must use all means to reduce the sulfur content of pig iron, which is the most important material and technical foundation for improving the quality of steel. But at the same time, converter steelmaking must also actively take desulfurization measures to improve the quality of steel. We believe that only by implementing the policy of walking on two legs can we rapidly improve the quality of steel.

    Qingdao City's converter steelmaking has achieved a double leap in quality and output, especially the fact of improving the quality of converter steel, which provides two important experiences for the current iron and steel front. The first experience is: while improving the quality of pig iron from small blast furnaces, converter steelmaking also actively takes desulfurization measures, and the quality of converter steel can victoriously overcome the sulfur barrier. The second experience is: solving the desulfurization problem in small blast furnaces or converters does not mean solving the problem of steel quality, because the quality of steel not only requires strict control of sulfur content but also strict control of carbon, silicon, manganese, and phosphorus content. Even if these five elements are well controlled during smelting in the converter, it cannot be said that there is good steel, it also depends on a series of technical issues outside the furnace. From iron to steel, this is a qualitative change. To achieve this qualitative change, comrades who lead converter steelmaking and master converter production have many techniques to learn and many measures to take.

    If it is said that various regions have grasped the quality of pig iron from small blast furnaces early, but have not yet completely passed the test, and if it is said that solving the quality problem of converter steel is more complicated than solving the quality problem of pig iron from small blast furnaces, then various regions should, while grasping the quality of pig iron from small blast furnaces, grasp the quality of converter steel early and comprehensively.

### 全面提高转炉钢的质量

    全面提高转炉钢的质量
    青岛市把酸性的转炉炼钢设备改成碱性的炼钢设备。用高硫铁炼出了几乎是全部合格（单指含硫量）的钢，其中一级品（含硫0.055％以下）占80％以上。这件事有必要提起钢铁战线同志的注意。
    采用碱性转炉炼钢，并不是什么新经验，可是，为什么青岛市能够采用这个办法取得较好的成绩，有些地方却没有或者没有完全采用这种办法呢？据说客观的或主观的原因很多：这里有改造转炉设备需用的材料问题，有掌握碱性炼钢设备的技术问题，等等。怎样对待这些问题呢？一种是，下最大决心，把改革炼钢设备当作提高转炉钢的质量和产量中的一个重要环节，狠狠地抓住这一环节；发动全体职工献计策，解决所需材料，同时抽调专门人员学习使用碱性炼钢设备。经过试点取得经验以后，迅速加以推广。青岛市炼钢职工们就是用这种方法来提高钢的质量。但是也有一些企业坐等有利条件，等待小高炉的生铁含硫量降低，而在转炉钢方面不采取有力措施（例如采用碱性热风化铁炉进行脱硫），这显然是不对的。当然，毫无疑问，小高炉必须用一切办法降低生铁含硫量，这是提高钢的质量的最主要的物质技术基础。但是与此同时，转炉炼钢方面也必须积极采取脱硫措施，提高钢的质量。我们认为只有贯彻两条腿走路的方针，才能迅速提高钢的质量。
    青岛市转炉炼钢质量产量双双跃进，特别是提高转炉钢的质量的事实，给当前钢铁战线提供了两条重要的经验。第一条经验是：在提高小高炉的生铁质量的同时，转炉炼钢方面也积极采取脱硫措施，转炉钢的质量就可以胜利地闯过硫磺关。第二条经验是：小高炉或转炉解决了脱硫问题，并不等于解决了钢的质量问题，因为钢的质量，不仅对含硫的成分要求严格，对碳、矽、锰、磷的含量也要求很严格。这五种元素在转炉内冶炼的时候，即使都控制得很好了，也还不能说就有了好钢，它还取决于炉外一系列的技术问题。从铁到钢，这是一个质变。要实现这个质变，领导转炉炼钢和掌握转炉生产的同志，有许多技术要学习，有许多措施要采取。
    如果说各地对于小高炉的生铁质量抓得早，至今还没有完全过关，如果说解决转炉钢的质量问题比解决小高炉生铁质量问题还要复杂些，那么各地就更应该在抓小高炉生铁质量的同时，及早地全面地抓转炉钢的质量了。
