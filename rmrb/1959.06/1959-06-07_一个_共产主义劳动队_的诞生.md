    The Birth of a "Communist Labor Brigade"
    By Ye. Mukhatayev, Editor of the Factory Newspaper of the "Artificial Fiber Factory" in Serpukhov City, Moscow Oblast, USSR

    At the end of last year, the entire Soviet people enthusiastically discussed the magnificent Seven-Year Plan. Then, inspiring news spread throughout the country: advanced Soviet youth began establishing "Communist Labor Brigades" in factories, with the slogan: "Work, study, and live in the communist way!"
    Fine seeds were sown in deeply cultivated soil. The "Communist Labor Brigade" movement developed rapidly.
    I would like to talk to our dear Chinese friends about how the first "Communist Labor Brigade" of the "Artificial Fiber Factory" in Serpukhov City, Moscow Oblast, was established, and what new atmosphere it brought to the factory's life and work.
    Last December, a work team was organized in the acetic acid workshop of this factory, including four shifts in one group, totaling forty-eight people.
    The work team was established according to the strict principle of voluntarism. However, the organizers of the work team also encountered some unexpected things, and some people were disappointing.
    The assistant of the section chief, Mikhail Sharomachin, the captain of a young work team, surprisingly said when others introduced the exemplary guarantee of the work team to him:
      "Study? Why study? I am an assistant to the section chief, I have enough knowledge."
    Some comrades wanted to persuade him, but to no avail: this work team captain did not take the lead in the collective, but stood at the tail end.
    At the plenary meeting, everyone seriously discussed and approved the highly communist guarantee conditions for striving for the title of "Communist Labor Brigade." All members decided to increase labor productivity by 30% before 1964, reduce equipment downtime, master multiple related professional skills, tirelessly improve their political and professional level, and fight against the old remnants in life.
    The guarantee conditions stated: Based on the principle of "One for all, all for one," cooperate friendly in production, get along friendly in life, and make every effort to learn to work and live in a communist way.
    The good news about the first achievements in working in a new way soon spread.
    The thread twisters, members of the work team, were the first to complete the production quota for the factory's transition to a seven-hour work day. The work team overfulfilled the production tasks step by step, and the product quality was very high. The labor productivity of the female workers increased.
    The main reasons for the achievements were mutual assistance, a collective sense of responsibility for common achievements, and a high level of self-consciousness throughout the collective.
    In the past, each shift had two female workers to supervise quality. They hung two supervisory bobbins on each machine, based on which the work of the thread twisters was evaluated. This not only consumed a lot of labor, but also the supervisory bobbins were usually discarded as waste after inspection. In this way, the workshop wasted about three tons of high-quality silk every month. After the establishment of the labor team, the thread twisters decided to collectively guarantee product quality and supervise themselves. As a result, all four work shifts of the team improved their product quality. In this way, not only was labor saved, but the work team saved four thousand rubles per month simply by reducing waste yarn ends.
    The members promoted the collectivist spirit of mutual assistance and cooperation. For example, in the past, each thread twister relied on working alone to connect the lines and take off the full bobbins, and then the installers also adjusted the machines by themselves, which took one or two hours. Now, all the free members of the work team, sometimes eight or nine people, work together. In this way, the machine downtime is reduced to fifteen to twenty minutes.
    All the female workers successfully mastered multiple related professional skills in the work process. The thread twisters can do the work of the installers, and the installers can also do the work of the thread twisters. This eliminated downtime. When comrades were absent due to illness or other reasons, the work team still completed the task without adding people.
    The work team decided to cultivate the qualities of new people in the communist society while achieving production achievements, and to make themselves well-rounded people.
    Due to the implementation of the seven-hour work system, the female workers had more time for rest, study, and cultural entertainment. How to make better use of these times? The comrades of the work team began to collectively watch movies and ski. They visited the Serpukhov Art and History Museum, visited the Tretyakov Gallery in Moscow, enjoyed panoramic movies, and visited several textile factories.
    The municipal association for the popularization of political science and the factory club management committee jointly held a cultural university. Two hundred and fifty employees participated in the cultural university. The university study period is one and a half years.
      All members of the "Communist Labor Brigade" are studying. There are students in the team who are in preparatory classes for universities, correspondence and night university students, students in youth worker schools, and students in political education groups, etc.
    There is also such a clause in the team's guarantee conditions:
  "Cultivate ten thread twisters from middle school students." How will this be achieved? Everyone adopted Lyuba Sarova's suggestion, that is, to go to the school, talk to the tenth grade students, arouse their interest in the factory, invite them to visit the workshop, and help the female students gain good production knowledge.
    The work team of the acetic acid workshop of the "Artificial Fiber Factory" in Serpukhov City first won the title of "Communist Labor Brigade," and now collectives that have won this honorary title have spread to many production sections of the factory.

### 一个“共产主义劳动队”的诞生

    一个“共产主义劳动队”的诞生
    苏联莫斯科州谢尔普霍夫城“人造纤维厂”厂报编辑  叶·穆哈塔耶夫
    去年年底，全苏人民热烈地讨论了宏伟的七年计划。接着，全国传开了振奋人心的消息：先进的苏联青年在工厂开始建立“共产主义劳动队”，队的口号是：“按照共产主义的方式工作、学习和生活！”
    精良的种籽播在深耕细作的土壤上了。“共产主义劳动队”运动飞速地开展起来。
    我想向我们亲爱的中国朋友谈谈莫斯科州谢尔普霍夫城“人造纤维厂”第一个“共产主义劳动队”是怎样建立起来的，它给工厂生活和工作带来了什么新气象。
    去年12月，这个工厂的醋酸车间组织了一个工作队，这个队包括一个组的四个班，共有四十八个人。
    按照严格的自愿原则，工作队建立起来了。但是，工作队的组织者也会碰到些意料不到的事，有一些人令人感到失望。
    工段长的助理，一个青年工作队的队长米哈伊尔·沙罗马钦，当别人向他介绍工作队的示范性保证书时，他令人惊奇地说：
      “学习？干吗学习？我是工段长助理，我有足够的知识。”
    有些同志想去说服他，但毫无成效：这位工作队长不是在集体中带头，而是站在尾巴后头。
    在全体会议上，大家认真地讨论并通过了争取“共产主义劳动队”称号的高度共产主义的保证条件。全体队员决定，1964年前提高劳动生产率30％，减少设备窝工现象，掌握多种性质相近的专业技能，顽强地提高自己的政治和业务水平，跟生活中旧的残余进行斗争。
    保证条件上写着：以“我为人人，人人为我”为原则，在生产中友好协作，在生活中友好相处，将尽一切努力学会按共产主义方式工作和生活。
    关于按新的方式工作的第一批成就的喜讯很快地传来了。
    工作队的队员捻线工们首先完成了使工厂过渡到七小时工作日的生产定额。工作队按部就班地超额完成了生产任务，产品质量很高。女工们的劳动生产率提高了。
    取得成绩的主要原因是相互的帮助、对共同成绩的集体责任感和整个集体的高度自觉。
    从前，每一个班有两个女工监督质量。她们在每一部机器上挂上两个监督纱管，根据这个评定捻线工的工作。这不仅耗费许多劳动，而且监督用的纱管在检查以后照例当作废品扔掉了。这样，每月车间就有三吨左右的高质丝白白浪费掉了。劳动队建立后，捻线工决定集体保证产品质量，自我监督。结果全队的四个工作班都提高了自己的产品质量。这样，不但节省了人力，而且仅仅因为减少废纱头一项，工作队每月就节约了四千卢布。
    队员们发扬了互助协作的集体主义精神。例如，从前每一个捻线工凭单干接线和取下绕满了的纱管，然后，折装工也凭单干来调整机器，这个过程需一两个小时。现在，工作队里一切有空的队员，有时是八九个人一齐动手干。这样，机器停止的时间缩短到十五到二十分钟。
    全体女工在工作过程中成功地掌握了多种性质相近的专业技能。捻线工能完成折装工的活，折装工也能完成捻线工的活。从而消灭了窝工现象。当同志们因病或其他原因缺勤时，工作队不加人也照样完成了任务。
    工作队决定在取得生产成就的同时，也要培养新的、共产主义社会的人的品质，使自己成为全面发展的人。
    由于实行了七小时工作制，女工们休息、学习和文化娱乐的时间便更多了。如何更好地利用这些时间呢？工作队的同志们开始集体看电影、滑雪。她们参观了谢尔普霍夫艺术历史博物馆，去莫斯科参观了特列奇雅柯夫画廊，欣赏了全景电影，并且访问了几个纺织工厂。
    市政治科学普及协会分会与工厂俱乐部管理委员会共同举办了文化大学。有二百五十名职工参加了文化大学。大学学习期限为一年半。
      “共产主义劳动队”的全体队员都在学习。队里有大学先修班的学员、函授和夜大学的学生、青年工人学校的学生、政治教育小组的学员，等等。
    在队的保证条件中还有这样一条：
  “从中学生中培养十名捻线工”。这将如何实现呢？大家采纳了柳芭·萨罗娃的建议，即上学校去，找十年级的学生谈心，引起他们对工厂的兴趣，请他们到车间参观，并帮助女学生们获得良好的生产知识。
    谢尔普霍夫城“人造纤维厂”醋酸车间的工作队首先获得了“共产主义劳动队”称号，而现在取得这个荣誉称号的集体已普及到工厂许多生产工段中了。
