In Praise of Martyr An Yemin
Guo Moruo

Comrade An Yemin, brave Comrade An Yemin, you, the Party's excellent son, the motherland's excellent son! You are not dead, not dead, never dead, you, like Dong Cunrui and Huang Jiguang, will forever stand tall with your thick-browed, big-eyed heroic posture. Your blood splashes onto the Five-Star Red Flag, your heroic figure forever stands tall and firm. You not only protected weapons more precious than life, you not only punished the American imperialist lackeys, you have forever conquered the death that no one can avoid! Comrade An Yemin, although you are only twenty years old, you will always be, always twenty years old. Your blooming flower of youth radiates the brilliance of patriotism, forever, forever it will not wither. You are the son of a farmer from the Northeast Plain, you have suffered the ravages of Japanese imperialism, you have seen the grass roots and tree bark in the stomach of Martyr Yang Jingyu, (Note 1) you have suffered even more from the cruel rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries. How could you tolerate the compatriots of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu still enduring the hellish suffering of your childhood? You are a glorious member of the Communist Youth League, you are always ready to dedicate your life to the cause of the Party. The Party has posthumously recognized you as a glorious Party member, you sought benevolence and obtained it, sacrificed your life for righteousness. Your enthusiasm is fiercer than a raging flame, it is you who conquered that merciless fire, not that merciless fire that destroyed you! You are a strong coastal artillery soldier, you once said: "The coast and I are inseparable in life and death," the enemy under your eyelids looked like ants. How can the East Sea be as broad as your mind, how can the Pacific Ocean be as broad as your attitude? Not only is there no "dirty" mud in your thinking, (Note 2) any "dirty" mud has been thoroughly washed away by you. You are a standard aiming hand, you once said: "Be like the pine tree by the sea, unafraid of wind and rain," but in fact, how can the pine tree by the sea compare to you! You aim at the direction of the revolution even more accurately, you are truly worthy of our revolutionary martyrs, and you also "sowed the seeds of happiness for the next generation." Martyr An Yemin, immortal Martyr An Yemin, you, the Party's excellent son, the motherland's excellent son! You will forever stand tall with your thick-browed, big-eyed heroic posture, so that young and old for thousands of generations will learn from you. Learn from you aiming at the direction designated by the Party, bravely and strongly, towards communism!
                        1959, 6, 18.

    (Note 1) The body of Martyr Yang Jingyu was dissected by the Japanese invaders, and some grass roots and tree bark remained in his stomach, which is now preserved in the Harbin Martyrs Memorial Hall. Martyr An mentioned this matter during his lifetime. (See "Green Pine by the Sea")
    (Note 2) "Dirty" means filthy, a Northeast dialect. Martyr An once said, "Seeing the benefits of cooperativization with my own eyes, it really washed away the dirty mud in my thinking." All the words in quotation marks in the poem are quotations from Martyr An, as seen in "Green Pine by the Sea."

    赞安业民烈士
    郭沫若安业民同志，英勇的安业民同志，你，党的优秀的儿子，祖国的优秀的儿子！你没有死，没有死，永远也没有死，你像董存瑞和黄继光一样，将永远挺立着你浓眉大眼的英姿。你的血飞溅上五星红旗，你的英姿永远地顶天立地。你不仅保护了比生命还要宝贵的武器，你不仅惩罚了美帝国主义者的猪仔，你是永远征服了谁也难免的那一个死！安业民同志，你虽然仅仅二十岁，但你永远是，永远是二十岁。你怒放着的青春之花焕发着爱国主义的光辉，永远地，永远地不会凋萎。你是东北平原的农民的儿子，你受过日本帝国主义的蹂躏，你看过杨靖宇烈士胃中的草根树皮，（注一）你更受过国民党反动派的残酷统治。你哪能容忍台澎金马的同胞们依然身受着你幼年时代的地狱苦趣？你是光荣的共产主义青年团员，你随时都在准备着：把生命献给党的事业。党已追认了你为光荣的党员，你是求仁得仁，舍生取义。你的热情比猛烈的火焰还要猛烈，是你征服了那无情的烈火，不是那无情的烈火毁灭了你！你是坚强的海岸炮兵战士，你曾说：“海岸和你是生死不可分离”，你眼皮下的敌人看来如同蚂蚁。东海哪有你的心胸那样宏阔，太平洋哪有你的态度那样宽余？你思想上不仅没有“埋汰”泥污，（注二）任何“埋汰”泥污都已被你彻底冲洗。你是标准的方向瞄准手，你曾说：“要像海边的青松不怕风雨”，其实海边的青松哪能和你相比！你对革命的方向瞄得更十分准确，你真无愧于我们革命的先烈，你也“给下一代播下了幸福的种籽”。安业民烈士，不朽的安业民烈士，你，党的优秀的儿子，祖国的优秀的儿子！你将永远挺立着你浓眉大眼的英姿，使千年万代的青年、老年都向你学习。学习你瞄准着党所指定的方向，英勇地，坚强地，走向共产主义！
                        1959，6，18。
    （注一）杨靖宇烈士的尸体曾被日寇解剖，在胃中尚残留一些草根树皮，现保存于哈尔滨烈士纪念馆。安烈士在生前曾谈到此事。（见“海边青松”）
    （注二）“埋汰”犹肮脏，乃东北土语。安烈士曾说“亲眼看到合作化的好处，真是把思想上埋汰泥污都冲洗干净了”。诗中凡有用引号的话都是安烈士的语录，具见“海边青松”。
