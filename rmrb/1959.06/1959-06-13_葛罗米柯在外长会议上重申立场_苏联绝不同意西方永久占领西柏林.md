    Gromyko Reiterates Position at Foreign Ministers' Conference
    The Soviet Union Will Never Agree to the West's Permanent Occupation of West Berlin
    Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, June 12th: The Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference held a plenary session today, chaired by Lloyd.

    The central issue discussed at the meeting was the new proposals put forward by the Soviet delegation on June 10 concerning the West Berlin issue and the issue of an all-German committee. In their speeches, the representatives of Western countries attempted to distort the Soviet Union's new proposals, describing them as an "ultimatum," and objected to the Soviet proposals, attempting to permanently maintain the outdated occupation regime in West Berlin.

    The head of the Soviet delegation, Gromyko, analyzed the speeches of the Western representatives in detail in his speech. He emphasized that the Western countries' attempt to make the Soviet Union agree to the permanent retention of the occupation regime in West Berlin was in vain, and the Soviet Union could not sign any document with this purpose. He said, "Let us consider the situation that fourteen years have passed since the end of World War II, and the situation has changed. Let us seek an agreement on a realistic basis."

    Gromyko emphasized that the Soviet side has the desire to reach such an agreement. However, the issue does not depend entirely on the Soviet Union; it depends on all the participating countries of the conference.

    The meeting decided to hold an informal meeting of foreign ministers on June 15.

    葛罗米柯在外长会议上重申立场
    苏联绝不同意西方永久占领西柏林
    新华社12日讯　据塔斯社日内瓦讯：日内瓦外长会议今天举行全体会议，由劳埃德担任主席。
    会议讨论的中心问题是苏联代表团6月10日提出的关于西柏林问题和全德委员会问题的新建议。西方国家代表在发言中企图歪曲苏联的新建议，把它说成是“最后通牒”，并且对苏联的建议提出反对意见，企图永久保留已经过时的西柏林占领制度。
    苏联代表团团长葛罗米柯在发言中详细地分析了西方代表的发言。他强调指出西方国家企图使苏联同意永久保留西柏林的占领制度，而这种企图是枉费心机的，苏联不可能在抱着这种目的的任何文件上签字。他说，让我们来考虑这样一种情况吧，这就是第二次世界大战已经结束十四年了，情况已经发生了变化。让我们在现实的基础上来谋求协议吧。
    葛罗米柯强调说，在苏联方面，它是有达成这种协议的愿望的。但问题不完全取决于苏联，它取决于会议的所有参加国。
    会议决定在6月15日举行外长们的非正式会议。
