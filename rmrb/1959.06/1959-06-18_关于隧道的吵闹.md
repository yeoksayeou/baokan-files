    The magnificent office building of the United States Senate has been completed. Suddenly, the completion of the building caused a stir in the Senate Appropriations Committee meeting. Of course, this dispute was not because its construction cost was too high (more than 30 million US dollars, exceeding the planned cost by more than 10 million US dollars), but because the senators believed that the builders did not provide them with adequate service.
    It turns out that the new Senate building is a short distance from the Capitol. In order to save the honorable senators the trouble of going back and forth, a tunnel was built between the new building and the Capitol, through which an underground tram passes. However, the tunnel was not connected to the new building. This was already enough to make the noble senators dissatisfied. How could one expect them to leave the new building and still have to walk a few steps to get on the train? What made the senators even more furious was that the end of the tunnel was still dozens of steps away from the center of the Capitol. How could the end of the tunnel not be built near the elevator room inside the Capitol so that senators could immediately enter the elevator room after getting off the underground tram?
    Also, the floor of the new building is made of special rubber panels. It is said to be a silent floor. This is certainly something to pay attention to, but unfortunately, after the senators moved in, there were continuous incidents of falling. Therefore, the senators could not help but blame: the floor is too slippery, why not put a carpet on the floor? If carpets are to be used, why not use cheaper flooring materials?
    In addition to scolding the construction engineers for being stupid, the senators put forward various renovation proposals. For example, the tunnel entrance should be relocated inside the new building, the end of the tunnel should be built to the elevator entrance of the Capitol, and beautiful carpets should be laid on the slippery floor of the new building, etc. No problem, these proposals were immediately accepted. Some senators seemed uneasy and said: the tunnel renovation project will cost another four million US dollars, and after the renovation, they can walk fifty steps less. That is to say, it costs eighty thousand US dollars to walk one step less. However, some senators are very interested in laying carpets and demand a study of the use of carpets in public buildings because he firmly believes that the results of this study will greatly increase the number of carpets purchased by the government, and carpet merchants will also have considerable benefits.

    关于隧道的吵闹
    美国国会参议院的富丽堂皇的办公大楼落成了。忽然，大厦的建成，在参议院拨款委员会会议上引起了一场吵闹。当然，这场争吵不是因为它的建造费用太高（共三千多万美元，超过计划费用一千多万美元），而是因为参议员们认为大厦建造者给他们的服务太不周到了。
    原来，参议院新厦距离国会大厦有一小段路。为了使议员先生不致有往返之劳，就在新厦与国会大厦之间修建了隧道、通行地下电车。但是，隧道并没有与新厦连接起来。这已经够使高贵的参议员先生们不满了，怎么能够设想要他们离开新厦，仍需走几步才能上车呢。更使参议员光火的是，隧道的终点又竟然距离国会大厦的中心还有数十步之遥。怎么可以不把隧道终点修至国会大厦内电梯间附近，这样，使参议员走下了地下电车，就可以立即进入电梯间呢。
    还有，新厦的地板是用特制的橡胶板拼成的。据说这是一种无声的地板。这当然是应该讲究的，但不幸参议员先生们乔迁之后，连续发生摔倒事件。于是，又免不了引起参议员的责难：地板太光滑了，为什么不在地板上铺上地毯？如果要用地毯，又为什么不采用便宜的地板材料？
    参议员们除了大骂建筑工程师愚蠢之外，提出了各种各样的改建工程的主张。例如，应该把隧道入口改设在新厦内部啦，隧道的终点则应该修到国会大厦的电梯口啦，新厦的光滑地板也应铺漂亮的地毯啦等等。没有问题，这些主张都立即被接受了。有的参议员似乎有所不安地说：隧道改建工程要再花四百万美元，改建后可少走五十步路。那就是说，为了少走一步却要花八万美元。然而，也有的参议员对铺地毯很有兴趣，要求研究公共建筑物中地毯使用的情况，因为他深信这个研究的结果将使政府购买的地毯数量猛增，地毯商也会有不小的好处。　（乐山）
