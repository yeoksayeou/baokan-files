Including the original ones, there are currently more than 4,000 savings institutions throughout the autonomous region. The vast majority of savings offices have implemented a system of being open at noon, in the evening, and on Sundays to facilitate people's deposits and withdrawals. Cadres from the Baotou Municipal People's Bank have strengthened their services to basic construction workers and often handle deposit and withdrawal business on various construction sites. The savings offices in Hohhot City have simplified procedures and sped up efficiency on the one hand, and strengthened mobile services on the other, which has been welcomed by depositors. The Lianying Store Savings Office and the "March 8th" Savings Office in this city have recently received a constant stream of letters of praise and wall posters of praise from depositors.
