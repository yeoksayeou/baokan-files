Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 12th: More than 1,200 Tibetan students who graduated from the Central Institute for Nationalities, the Southwest Institute for Nationalities, the Xianyang Tibet Public School and other institutions, and more than 200 Han students who understand the Tibetan language have all taken up their work posts in Tibet.

More than 90% of the Tibetan students who came to work in Tibet are children of farmers, herdsmen, and handicraftsmen. After several years of nurturing by the Party, their educational level has risen from illiteracy to primary, junior high, senior high, and secondary vocational school levels respectively. Their class consciousness has generally improved, and 60% of them have honorably become members of the Communist Party or the Communist Youth League. After the Tibetan upper-class reactionary clique launched the rebellion, they wrote letters of application and pledges to the Party organizations in their schools, requesting to return to Tibet as soon as possible and dedicate their youth to the cause of liberation of the Tibetan people.

After arriving in Lhasa, these Tibetan students requested to work in the most difficult places. Based on their requests and the needs of the actual work, the vast majority have now been assigned to grassroots levels in Lhasa, Shannan, Gyantse, Shigatse, Heihe, Qamdo, Ngari, and other regions to do mass work. The more than 200 Han students who understand the Tibetan language who came to Tibet at the same time as the Tibetan students had all worked in Tibet before, and now most of them have returned to their familiar work posts. These Tibetan and Han students have all expressed to the Party that they will resolutely listen to the Party's words and victoriously complete the tasks assigned by the Party.

    千余名藏族学员走上工作岗位
    新华社拉萨12日电　从中央民族学院、西南民族学院、咸阳西藏公学等院校毕业来西藏工作的一千二百多名藏族学员和二百多名懂得藏语的汉族学员，已经全部走上了工作岗位。
    来西藏工作的藏族学员中，90％以上都是农牧民和手工业者的子弟。经过几年来党的培养，他们的文化程度已从原来的文盲分别达到了高小、初中、高中和中等专科学校的水平，阶级觉悟普遍有了提高，其中60％的人已经光荣地成为共产党员或共青团员。西藏上层反动集团发动叛乱后，他们纷纷向学校党组织写申请书和保证书，要求早日回到西藏，为西藏人民的解放事业献出自己的青春。
    这批藏族学员到达拉萨后，纷纷要求到最艰苦的地方去工作。根据他们的请求和实际工作的需要，现在绝大部分已被分配到拉萨、山南、江孜、日喀则、黑河、昌都和阿里等地区的基层去做群众工作。同藏族学员同时来西藏的二百多名懂得藏语的汉族学员，原来都在西藏工作过，现在他们大多数又回到了自己熟悉的工作岗位。这些藏、汉族学员都向党表示：坚决听党的话，胜利完成党所交给的任务。
