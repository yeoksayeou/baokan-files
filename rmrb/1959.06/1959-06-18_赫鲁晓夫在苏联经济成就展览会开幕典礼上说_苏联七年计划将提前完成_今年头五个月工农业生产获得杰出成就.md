Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 16th: The Soviet National Economic Achievement Exhibition grandly opened in Moscow on the afternoon of the 16th. More than 90,000 representatives of workers, collective farm members, scientists, and office workers from Moscow and all over the Soviet Union attended the opening ceremony. Diplomatic envoys from various countries and delegations from various People's Democratic countries also attended the opening ceremony.

Soviet Party and government leaders, including Khrushchev, Voroshilov, Kozlov, Kuusinen, and Kirichenko, attended the opening ceremony.

At 5 p.m., the opening ceremony began under the chairmanship of Maksarev, Chairman of the General Affairs Committee of the Exhibition.

Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, spoke at the ceremony. He said that the opening of this exhibition is a major event in the lives of the Soviet people. It should become the best school for learning and promoting the latest achievements in the Soviet national economy. It should reflect the level of Soviet technological progress and advanced labor methods and production organization.

Khrushchev pointed out that the resolutions of the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union aroused soaring political enthusiasm and labor enthusiasm throughout the Soviet Union, which is evidenced by the widespread national socialist competition. He said that there is no doubt that the plan for further development of the Soviet Union's economy, culture, and improvement of the people's material welfare formulated by the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union will be completed ahead of schedule.

Khrushchev said that in the first five months of this year, Soviet industry completed the total output value plan by 105%. Compared with the same period last year, the output of pig iron increased by 1.44 million tons, oil production increased by 6.2 million tons, coal increased by 5.7 million tons, various textiles increased by 110 million meters, the amount of basic construction work increased by 9%, and the amount of construction and installation work increased by 14%.

When talking about the achievements in agriculture, Khrushchev said that by June 10, the Soviet Union had sown 126.3 million hectares of spring-sown crops. Among them, the planting area of ​​corn increased by 2.8 million hectares compared with 1958, and the planting area of ​​sugar beet expanded by about 500,000 hectares compared with last year.

Khrushchev said that in the past year, the number of cattle in the Soviet Union increased by 15%, pigs increased by 17%, and sheep increased by 7%. In the first five months of this year, collective farms and state farms across the country sold 54% more live livestock and 30% more milk to the state than in the same period last year.

Khrushchev said that this year, almost all parts of the Soviet Union have all the necessary conditions to achieve a bumper harvest of grain, industrial crops, fodder crops, potatoes, vegetables, fruits, and grapes.

Khrushchev said that the upcoming plenary session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union will discuss the issue of further developing the technical level of the Soviet national economy. He emphasized that the main task now is to implement the overall mechanization and automation of production, the modernization of equipment, and the replacement of outdated equipment with new, more productive, and more economical equipment. He pointed out that the Soviet Union now has all the necessary conditions to achieve this task.

Khrushchev finally said that for the Communist Party, there is no more important task than caring about the welfare of the people. The Soviet people's labor feats convince everyone that the task of building the material and technical foundation of communism in the Soviet Union and ensuring the victory of the Soviet Union in the peaceful economic competition with capitalist countries will undoubtedly be accomplished.

    苏联七年计划将提前完成
    今年头五个月工农业生产获得杰出成就
    新华社莫斯科16日电　苏联国民经济成就展览会16日下午在莫斯科隆重开幕。参加开幕典礼的有莫斯科和来自苏联各地的工人、集体农庄庄员、科学家、机关工作者的代表共九万多人。参加开幕典礼的还有各国的外交使节和各人民民主国家的代表团。
    赫鲁晓夫、伏罗希洛夫、科兹洛夫、库西宁、基里钦科等苏联党和政府的领导人出席了开幕典礼。
    下午五时，开幕典礼在展览会总务委员会主席马克萨烈夫主持下开始。
    苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记、苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫在典礼上讲了话。他说，这个展览会的开幕是苏联人民生活中的一件大事，它应当成为学习和推广苏联国民经济中所取得的最新成就的最好的学校，它应当反映苏联技术进步的水平以及先进的劳动方法和生产组织。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会的决议在全苏联激起了蓬勃高涨的政治热情和劳动热情，在全国范围内广泛地开展全民的社会主义竞赛说明了这一点。他说，毫无疑问，苏共第二十一次代表大会所拟定的进一步发展苏联的经济、文化以及提高人民物质福利的计划将提前完成。
    赫鲁晓夫说，今年头五个月，苏联工业以105％完成了总产值计划。同去年同期比较，生铁产量增加了一百四十四万吨，石油产量增加了六百二十万吨，煤增加了五百七十万吨，各种纺织品增加了一亿一千万公尺，基本建设工作量增加了9％，建设安装工作量增加了14％。
    赫鲁晓夫在谈到农业方面的成就时说，到6月10日为止，苏联播种了一亿二千六百三十万公顷春播作物。其中，玉蜀黍的播种面积比1958年增加了二百八十万公顷，甜菜播种面积大约比去年扩大了五十万公顷。
    赫鲁晓夫说，在最近一年内，苏联牛的头数增加了15％，猪增加了17％，羊增加了7％。今年头五个月内，全国集体农庄和国营农场交售给国家的活牲畜比去年同期增加了54％，牛奶增加了30％。
    赫鲁晓夫说，今年，几乎全苏联各地都有着一切必要的条件来使谷物、技术作物和饲料作物、马铃薯、蔬菜、水果和葡萄得到丰收。
    赫鲁晓夫说，即将召开的苏共中央全体会议将讨论进一步发展苏联国民经济的技术水平的问题。他着重指出，现在主要的任务是实行生产的全盘机械化和自动化、设备的现代化以及用新的、生产效率更高、更经济的设备来代替过时的设备。他指出，苏联现在已经具备实现这一任务的一切必要条件。
    赫鲁晓夫最后说，对共产党来说，没有比关心人民的福利更加重要的任务了。苏联人民的劳动功勋使大家深信，在苏联建立共产主义的物质技术基础和保证苏联在同资本主义国家的和平经济竞赛中赢得胜利的任务，毫无疑问，是一定会完成的。（附图片）
