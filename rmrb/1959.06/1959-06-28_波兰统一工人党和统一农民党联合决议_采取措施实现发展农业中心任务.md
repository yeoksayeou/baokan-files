Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, 26th - According to the Polish Press Agency, the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party and the Central Committee of the Polish United Peasant Party have passed a joint resolution on the central tasks of agricultural development in Poland from 1959 to 1965.

The resolution stated that Polish agriculture has made great achievements in recent years. From 1954 to 1958, the total agricultural output value increased by 25%, and commodity production increased by 36%.

The resolution pointed out that although the results in the past two years have been very good, the growth of Polish agricultural products has still been too slow during this period, while the growth rate of livestock products has been faster.

The resolution stated that the Third Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party set the task for Polish agriculture to increase the total agricultural output value by 30% in the next seven years. This is of decisive significance for completing other tasks of national economic development, especially for increasing the real wages and incomes of the agricultural population.

The resolution stated that the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party and the Central Committee of the Polish United Peasant Party believe that in order to achieve this task, it is necessary to take a series of measures extensively in terms of basic investment in agriculture and the development of socio-economic initiative in rural areas.

The resolution stated that the necessity of agricultural intensification and the growing interest of farmers in rural technological progress require a significant increase in the degree of mechanization, that is, expanding the production of tractors. Therefore, it is necessary to expand tractor production to 30,000 units by 1965, and to 40,000 units in 1966 and 1967. The production of agricultural machinery should be doubled by 1965.

In order to realize this program, it is necessary to expand investment in agriculture and industries related to agriculture.

The resolution pointed out that the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party and the Central Committee of the Polish United Peasant Party believe that agricultural groups are broad and universal socio-economic organizations of farmers, and their main task is to organize farmers to improve the quantity and quality of products. At present, such groups have been organized in 18,000 villages with approximately 500,000 members. Agricultural groups are carrying out various activities in the common use of machinery, in breeding, animal husbandry, collectively supplying their members with means of production, in concluding contracts, and popularizing agricultural knowledge.

The resolution pointed out that carrying out the mass movement of agricultural groups and rebuilding agricultural technical bases will be carried out in parallel with further development of agricultural production cooperatives and consolidation of the socialist elements in agriculture.

The resolution stated that on the basis of farmers' voluntary participation, continuously consolidating agricultural production cooperatives organizationally and economically, like the large-scale development of agricultural groups, is an essential prerequisite for expanding production and achieving socio-economic development in rural areas.

The resolution concluded by saying that the program for agricultural development is not only a matter for rural areas, but also a matter for the working class, a matter for cities, a matter for the whole people, that is, it is the great cause of the worker-peasant alliance of People's Poland.

    波兰统一工人党和统一农民党联合决议
    采取措施实现发展农业中心任务
    新华社华沙26日电　据波兰通讯社报道：波兰统一工人党中央委员会和波兰统一农民党中央委员会通过了一项关于1959—1965年波兰农业发展的中心任务的联合决议。
    决议说，近年来波兰农业取得了很大的成就，自1954年到1958年，农业总产值增加了25％，商品生产增长了36％。
    决议指出，虽然最近两年成绩很好，但是在这一时期，波兰农产品的增长仍然是太慢了，而畜产品增长的速度是较快的。
    决议说，波兰统一工人党第三次代表大会给波兰农业提出了在最近七年内，把农业总产值增加30％的任务。这对于完成国民经济发展的其他任务，特别是对提高农业人口的实际工资和收入具有决定性的意义。
    决议说，波兰统一工人党中央委员会和波兰统一农民党中央委员会认为，为了实现这一任务，有必要在农业基本投资方面和发展农村社会经济的主动性方面广泛地采取一系列的措施。
    决议说，农业集约化的必要性和农民对农村技术进步的日益增长的兴趣要求大大提高机械化的程度，即扩大拖拉机的生产。因此，必须在1965年把拖拉机生产扩大到三万台，而在1966年至1967年扩大到四万台。农业机器的生产到1965年要增加两倍。
    为了实现这一纲领，必须扩大对农业和同农业有关的工业的投资。
    决议指出，波兰统一工人党中央委员会和波兰统一农民党中央委员会认为，农业小组乃是农民的广泛、普遍的社会经济组织，它的主要任务是组织农民提高产品的数量和质量。目前，这种小组已经在一万八千个村庄中组织起来，大约有五十万个成员。在共同使用机器、在育种、畜牧、集体地供应自己成员的生产资料方面，在订立合同普及农业知识等方面，农业小组进行着各种活动。
    决议指出，开展农业小组的群众性运动和改建农业技术基地将与进一步发展农业生产合作社和巩固农业中的社会主义成分同时并举。
    决议说，在农民自愿的基础上，不断从组织上和经济上巩固农业生产合作社，同大规模发展农业小组一样，是扩大生产，取得农村社会经济发展的必要的先决条件。
    决议最后说，农业发展的纲领不仅是农村的事情，而且也是工人阶级的事情，城市的事情，全民的事情，也就是说，这是人民波兰工农联盟的伟大事业。
