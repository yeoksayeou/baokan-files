China's Economic Circles Hold Symposium in Shanghai

A Hundred Schools of Thought Contend, Jointly Improving

Discussing Commodity Production, the Law of Value, and Piece-Rate Wages Under the Socialist System

(Our Newspaper News) The Institute of Economics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Institute of Economics of the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences recently convened a symposium on economic theory in Shanghai, discussing commodity production, the law of value, and piece-rate wages under the socialist system. Participants included 245 economic theory workers from economic science research institutions and economics departments of universities and colleges in various provinces and cities, economic workers from national economic departments and relevant departments of the Party committees, and economic theory workers. A total of 54 papers and 23 investigation reports were presented at the conference.

Regarding commodity production and the law of value under the socialist system, this conference focused on discussing three issues: self-sufficient production and commodity production in people's communes, the three types of exchange relationships under the socialist system, and the role of the law of value under the socialist system (the main content of the discussion can be found on page 7 of today's newspaper).

Regarding the issue of piece-rate wages under the socialist system, the conference analyzed and studied the experiences of implementing piece-rate wages in China over the past few years, based on investigative materials. It explored theoretically the characteristics of piece-rate wages as a form of wages that implements the principle of distribution according to labor, its advantages and disadvantages compared with time-based wages, its role under certain conditions, the conditions under which this form of wage can be adopted, and how piece-rate wages should be appropriately combined with other forms of wages. The conference also focused on discussing the relationship between political and ideological work and the principle of material interests. The discussion on this issue was not limited to piece-rate wages themselves but also involved how to correctly implement the principle of distribution according to labor under the socialist system.

China's economic circles have previously conducted relatively long-term discussions on the issues of commodity production and the law of value under the socialist system. Some preparations were made before this conference. The comrades who participated in the conference studied the issues to be discussed in advance, conducted investigations in state-owned enterprises and rural people's communes, submitted investigation reports, compiled and printed relevant materials, and wrote papers based on this, and conducted discussions in various regions and units.

The participating comrades believed that this conference had certain gains in terms of theory and academic style. This was mainly because the conference implemented the policy of combining theory with practice and the policy of letting a hundred schools of thought contend. The commodity production, law of value, and piece-rate wage issues under the socialist system discussed at this conference are all important issues in China's current real economic life and are also important issues in the socialist part of political economy. Conducting academic explorations on these issues is of great significance for correctly handling contradictions among the people from an economic relationship perspective, mobilizing the enthusiasm of urban and rural people in building socialism; for the consolidation of China's people's communes, and the further improvement and development of production relations within the people's communes; and for further improving the level of national economic planning and management. It also has a positive role in summarizing the experiences of China's socialist construction theoretically based on Marxist value theory and improving our theoretical level.

The participating comrades believed that the atmosphere of free discussion at this conference was very active. Various different academic views were given full play, and everyone strived to convince the other party with scientific arguments and engaged in debates with a relaxed mood. Through discussion and debate, they learned from each other's strengths and made up for their weaknesses, either modified their own arguments or strengthened their own arguments, and everyone improved to varying degrees.

In order to further strengthen cooperation in economic theory research work, after the discussion of theoretical issues came to an end, a working conference was held. Preliminary exchanges of views were made on key projects for future economic theory research, the issue of cooperation between economic research and teaching institutions, how to conduct economic investigation work in a planned manner, issues concerning the teaching and scientific research work of economics departments in universities and colleges, and the issue of compiling political economy textbooks.

Zhou Yang, Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, gave a speech at the conference on issues such as the relationship between theory and practice, the relationship between improvement and popularization, and the implementation of the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend in social science research work. Shi Ximin, Alternate Secretary of the Secretariat of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, also spoke at the conference.

    我国经济学界在上海举行讨论会
    百家争鸣　共同提高
    讨论了社会主义制度下商品生产、价值规律和计件工资问题
    本报讯　中国科学院经济研究所、上海社会科学院经济研究所，最近在上海召开经济理论讨论会，讨论社会主义制度下商品生产、价值规律和计件工资问题。参加会议的有各省、市的经济科学研究机关、高等学校经济院系的经济理论工作者、国家经济部门和党委有关部门的经济工作者和经济理论工作者二百四十五人。提到大会上的论文共有五十四篇，调查报告共二十三篇。
    关于社会主义制度下商品生产和价值规律，这次会议着重讨论了关于人民公社自给性生产和商品性生产、关于社会主义制度下三种交换关系、关于社会主义制度下价值规律的作用等三个问题（讨论的主要内容见今天本报第七版）。
    关于社会主义制度下计件工资问题，会议根据调查材料，对我国几年来实行计件工资的经验进行了分析研究。对于计件工资作为贯彻按劳分配原则的一种工资形式，它具有什么特点，它和计时工资比较起来，有什么优点和缺点，它在一定条件下的作用，在什么条件下可以采取这种工资形式，以及计件工资应该如何和其它工资形式适当地结合等问题，从理论上进行了探讨。会上并且着重讨论了政治思想工作和物质利益原则的关系问题。对这个问题的讨论，实际上不只限于计件工资本身，而且涉及在社会主义制度下如何正确贯彻按劳分配原则的问题。
    社会主义制度下商品生产和价值规律问题，我国经济学界过去曾经进行比较长期的讨论。这次会议以前，又进行了一些准备。参加会议的同志对这次会议所要讨论的问题，事前进行了研究，在国营企业和农村人民公社进行了调查，提出了调查报告，编印了有关资料，在此基础上写出了论文，并且在各地区、各单位进行了讨论。
    与会同志认为，这次会议在理论方面和学风方面，都有一定的收获。这主要是由于这次会议贯彻了理论结合实际和百家争鸣的方针。这次会议所讨论的社会主义制度下商品生产、价值规律以及计件工资问题，都是我国当前现实经济生活中的重要问题，而且是政治经济学社会主义部分的重要问题。对这些问题进行学术探讨，对于从经济关系上正确处理人内民部矛盾，调动城乡人民建设社会主义的积极性；对于我国人民公社的巩固，和人民公社内部生产关系的进一步完善和发展；对于进一步提高国民经济计划管理工作的水平，有着重大的意义。对于依据马克思主义的价值学说，从理论上总结我国社会主义建设的经验，提高我们的理论水平，也有积极的作用。
    与会同志认为，这次会议，自由讨论的空气十分活跃，各种不同的学术见解都得到发挥，大家都努力用科学的论证来说服对方，心情舒畅地进行辩论。经过讨论和争辩，互相取长补短，或者修改了自己的论点，或者强化了自己的论点，大家在不同的程度上都得到了提高。
    为了进一步加强在经济理论研究工作上的协作，这次会议在理论问题的讨论告一段落以后，接着举行了工作会议，就今后经济理论研究的重点项目，经济研究和教学机构的协作问题，如何有计划地进行经济调查工作问题，关于高等院校经济系的教学工作和科学研究工作问题，以及政治经济学教材的编写问题等，初步交换了意见。
    中共中央宣传部副部长周扬就社会科学研究工作中的理论联系实际、提高与普及的关系、贯彻百花齐放、百家争鸣的方针等问题，在会上作了讲话。中共上海市委书记处候补书记石西民也在会上讲了话。
