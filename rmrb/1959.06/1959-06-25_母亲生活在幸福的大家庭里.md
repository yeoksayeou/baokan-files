    Mother Lives in a Happy Big Family
    My wife and I work in other places, leaving only my elderly mother at home in Tianjin. She suffers from chronic heart disease and has fainted several times due to worsening symptoms. Fortunately, she was kindly cared for by neighbors and taken to the hospital for treatment, which quickly improved her condition.

    One day at noon, Comrade Sun Xiufang, a female worker from a certain factory, went to visit my mother as usual after getting off work. She found the old woman lying on the bed, her face black, unresponsive to calls, and unable to be moved. She couldn't help but cry out for help. The sound alarmed everyone in the building, and they rushed over. They discovered that my mother had suffered from gas poisoning. Everyone quickly opened the doors and windows, carried my mother outside, reported it to the police station, and finally managed to get the patient to the hospital.

    Comrade Qi Weigang from the police station visited my mother three or four times a day in his spare time. He continued to come even after she was discharged from the hospital. My mother said with emotion, "Comrade Qi is a good policeman of Chairman Mao and a good servant of the people, caring for me like his own son."

    母亲生活在幸福的大家庭里
    我和我爱人在外地工作，天津家里只留下一位年老的母亲。她因患慢性心脏病，几次病状恶化晕倒，幸被街坊邻居亲切照顾，陪送到医院治疗，才很快好转。
    一天中午，某厂女工孙秀芳同志下班回家，照例先去看我母亲。她发现老人横躺在床上，脸上发黑，叫不应也推不动，不禁失声大喊救命。声音惊动了全楼的人，大家急忙赶来，才发觉我母亲中了煤气。这时大家连忙打开门窗，把母亲抬到屋外，并报告派出所，最后设法把病人送进了医院。
    派出所的齐维纲同志，在工作之余每天都探望母亲三四次。直到出院后还常来。母亲感动地说“齐同志是毛主席的好警察，人民的好勤务员，像自己的亲儿子一样的关怀我。”
