    Regarding subject matter, I believe the first requirement is familiarity, the second is breadth, and the third is appropriate handling.

    "Write what you know." This is a famous saying from Gorky to young authors, and it's a rule of creative writing. Here, we must clarify the relationship between "writing what you know" and "becoming familiar with what you don't know." If you only focus on writing about what you know and don't constantly try to familiarize yourself with new life, your creative wellspring will dry up, and you will become detached from life and the masses. Even when writing about familiar subjects, you still need to constantly supplement them with new things from life. Therefore, combining with the masses and constantly familiarizing yourself with life is essential for any writer. However, if you are not yet familiar with new life and rush to write about it, you are bound to fail. It is said that in a certain region, twenty-eight writers simultaneously tried to seize a subject. That a subject can be seized is already strange, let alone twenty-eight people seizing it at the same time. Obviously, not all twenty-eight people were familiar with life in this region. Subjects gradually form after becoming familiar with life. How can you have a subject first and then become familiar with life? Naturally, this is a special example. However, some people understand reflecting reality and cooperating with tasks too simply, thinking that only writing about current events counts as reflecting reality and cooperating with tasks, thus abandoning what they are familiar with and forcing themselves to write about what they are not yet familiar with. The result is often wanting to be fast but not achieving it. It must be affirmed that writers should mainly depict modern life and cooperate with the political tasks of a certain historical period. But modern life is not equal to the life of the current year or month, and cooperating with tasks is not equal to illustrating policies. Art serving politics is a broad concept, and we should not narrow it. Of course, short stories, compared to novels, are more convenient for quickly reflecting reality. For example, if a writer already has accumulated experience in rural life, then after a relatively short period of observation and experience, he can still successfully write short stories reflecting the new life of the current people's communes. But in any case, you must be familiar with life, otherwise, you should rather write sketches or reports first (of course, sketches and reports also require a certain degree of familiarity and understanding of life).

    Secondly, subject matter should be broad and diverse. Our country's life is extremely rich and colorful, and these lives should be fully reflected in literature. Of course, compared with the works before liberation, the scope of life reflected in current works has expanded a lot. But from the perspective of the development of real life, our range of subject matter is still relatively narrow. Not long ago, there was a theory that advocated writing so-called "cutting-edge subjects." This is incorrect. In our lives, there are, of course, important and secondary things. Our literature should reflect the more important and essential things of this great era, but artistic reflection is not so simply and directly determined by the subject matter itself. From an ordinary event, you can write something great and deeply reflect the essence of social life. "The Rout" only writes about a very small guerrilla team, but it is a great work. "Xiao Erhei's Marriage" and "Li Youcai's Ditties" are not "cutting-edge subjects," but they are works of important significance. Important struggles and important constructions should be described by someone, but it is not appropriate to limit oneself based on the subject matter alone. Moreover, what is called "cutting-edge" is ultimately a minority. If everyone writes about this minority of things, how can literature reflect rich and colorful life? How can it express a hundred flowers blooming? "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" is the Party's literary policy, and it requires the diversification of subject matter, forms, and styles. Certain rules and regulations are still influencing writers, making some writers feel constrained, which is detrimental to the thorough implementation of the policy of "let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend."

    Of course, this does not mean advocating writing aimlessly. Our purpose is clear, which is to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, but this does not mean that only workers, peasants, and soldiers are allowed to be written about, especially not only "cutting-edge subjects" among workers, peasants, and soldiers. What is important is that writers have correct standpoints and viewpoints.

    Regarding the handling of subject matter. Lu Xun said, "Select materials strictly and dig deeply." These eight words are very important to us. In the long-term observation of life and people, the author constantly accumulates many materials, and gradually forms a subject from here. This requires a brewing process of comparison, selection, transformation, and germination. What is meant by "select materials strictly," I think, is that you should choose what you are more familiar with and what you feel is more meaningful, thereby deleting meaningless trivialities and supplementing things that can make your image more prominent. Therefore, it is easy to fail if you write as soon as you grab a piece of sporadic material, or if you are overwhelmed by a pile of huge and complex materials.

    Regarding "dig deeply," it is even more necessary to put in effort. This step is indispensable for writing good works, especially important for writing short stories. The significance of a character or an event is sometimes not immediately recognized. This requires in-depth observation, experience, analysis, and research, and requires your own insights and feelings. Writing a work is a bit like a mother's ten months of pregnancy. The character image and the meaning of the story gradually become clear in the process of gestation. Creation is a process that is both pleasant and painful. In this process, the author shares the fate, joy, and sorrow of the character, and finally feels that it must be written, at which time it is probably mature.

    The plot of the novel is also an important issue. The plot is to express the character's personality and the development of the story, that is, to concentrate the contradictions and struggles in daily phenomena and typify them, as Comrade Mao Zedong said. Therefore, do not vulgarly understand the meaning of the plot. Now, some works pursue plots in isolation, or use the thrill or coincidence of the plot to please readers. This tendency is not good.

### 关于短篇小说的题材问题

    关于短篇小说的题材问题
    关于题材，我以为第一要熟悉，第二要广泛，第三要处理恰当。
    写你所熟悉的。这是高尔基劝导青年作者的一句名言。也是创作的一条规律。这里要弄清“写你所熟悉的”和“熟悉你所未熟悉的”这两者的关系。如果你只顾写你熟悉的东西，而不经常去熟悉你所不熟悉的新生活，那么你的创作源泉就会枯竭，会使你脱离生活和群众；而即使写你熟悉的题材，你仍然得从生活中去不断补充新的东西，所以与群众结合，经常不断去熟悉生活，是任何作家所不可少的。但是如果你对新的生活尚未熟悉，就急急忙忙想写出来，这也不免要遭到失败。据说某个地区，有二十八个作家同时去抢题材。题材能抢，已是奇谈，而何况二十八个人同时去抢。显然这二十八个人并不都是熟悉这个地区的生活的。题材只有在熟悉生活之后，才逐渐形成，怎么能够先有题材然后去熟悉生活呢？自然这是特殊的例子。但是有些人把反映现实，配合任务，理解得过于简单，以为只有写当前的事物，才算反映现实，配合任务，因而放弃其熟悉的东西而硬要去写他所尚未熟悉的东西，其结果往往欲速而不达。作家主要应该去描写现代生活，配合一定历史时期的政治任务，这是必须肯定的。但现代生活并不等于当年当月的生活，配合任务更不等于图解政策。艺术服务于政治，是个广泛的概念，不要把它狭隘化。当然，短篇小说比起长篇小说来更便于迅速反映现实，比如一个作家对农村生活本来就有累积的经验，那末经过他较短时期的观察体验，他还是可以成功地写出反映当前人民公社新生活的短篇小说。但总之必须熟悉生活，否则宁可先写些速写、报告（当然，速写、报告也需要对生活有一定程度的熟悉和了解）。
    其次，题材要广泛，要多样化。我们国家的生活是极其丰富多采的，这些生活应该充分地在文学上得到反映。当然，和解放前的作品来比较，现在作品中所反映的生活范围是扩大得很多了。但从现实生活的发展来说，我们的取材范围，还是比较狭窄。不久以前，曾经有种理论，主张写所谓“尖端题材”，这是不正确的。在我们生活中，当然有重要的和次要的事物，我们的文学应该去反映出这伟大时代更主要更本质的东西，但艺术的反映，并不是那么简单地直接决定于题材本身。从一个平凡的事件中，可以写出很伟大的东西，可以深刻地反映出社会生活的本质。“毁灭”不过写那么一支很小的游击队，然而是伟大的作品。“小二黑结婚”“李有才板话”都不是什么“尖端题材”，却是有重要意义的作品。重要的斗争，重要的建设应该有人去描写，但只是从题材上去局限，是不应该的。而且所谓“尖端”终究是少数，如果大家都去写这少数的东西，文学上又怎样能够反映出丰富多采的生活呢？怎样能表现出百花齐放呢？百花齐放、百家争鸣是党的文艺方针，它要求题材、形式风格的多样化。某些清规戒律仍然在影响着作家，使有些作家感到支绌，这对于贯彻执行百花齐放、百家争鸣的方针是不利的。
    当然，这并不是说要提倡无目的地去写。我们的目的是鲜明的，就是为工农兵服务，但这并不等于只许写工农兵，尤其不等于只许写工农兵中的“尖端题材”。重要的是作家要有正确的立场和观点。
    关于题材的处理。鲁迅讲过“选材要严，开掘要深”。这八个字对于我们很重要。作者在长期观察生活人物中间，不断地累积着许多素材，逐渐从这里形成题材，这中间是要经过比较、选择、改造、生发的酝酿过程。所谓“选材要严”，我想是应该选择你所更熟悉的和你感到更有意义的东西，从而删去其没有意义的枝节的东西，补充足以使你的形象更加突出的东西，所以抓到一点零星材料就写，或者被大堆庞杂的材料所压倒，都是容易失败的。
    关于“开掘要深”，就更要下功夫，要写好作品，这一步决不可少，对于写短篇小说，尤其重要。一个人物，一件事情的意义，有时并不是一下就认识透的。这需要有深入的观察、体验、分析、研究，需要有自己的见解和感受。写作品有点像做母亲的十月怀胎，人物形象和故事的意义总是在孕育过程中逐渐明确起来。创作是既愉快又痛苦的过程，在这过程中作者和其人物同命运，共欢乐，同悲苦，而最后感到非写出来不可，这时大概是成熟了。
    小说的情节也是个重要的问题，情节是为了表现人物性格和故事的发展过程，也即是毛泽东同志所说的把日常现象中的矛盾和斗争集中起来，加以典型化。所以不要庸俗地去理解情节的意义。现在有些作品孤立地去追求情节，或者借情节的惊险或巧合来取悦读者，这种倾向是不好的。
