Berlin is the capital of the German Democratic Republic, but its western half (i.e., West Berlin, with a population of approximately 2.2 million) has been under the military occupation of the Western Three Powers for the past fourteen years since the end of the war. This phenomenon is extremely abnormal.

This white island in a red sea has become a "frontline city" for the West in conducting the Cold War. The three-power garrison totals approximately 12,000 troops, with another 19,300 police officers. 32% of the police bureau officials are former Nazis and former secret police. Other military institutions and special service organizations are even more numerous, specializing in sending agents to the German Democratic Republic to carry out subversive activities. There are seventy-four militarist organizations similar to the "Steel Helmet" of the Hitler era, and many powerful radio stations (such as RIAS) incessantly broadcast revanchist propaganda, clamoring for war and inciting sabotage activities to the German Democratic Republic every day. At the same time, provocative and slanderous leaflets and pamphlets are often attached to balloons and distributed from West Berlin to various parts of the German Democratic Republic. Obviously, the purpose of the West in continuing to occupy West Berlin is no longer to supervise and eliminate German militarist forces as stipulated in the four-power agreement on Berlin, but to use it as a base for conducting hostile activities against the German Democratic Republic and other socialist countries, thereby exacerbating tensions in Europe. The "Berlin Affair" in June 1948 and the Berlin riots on June 17, 1953, were the most blatant manifestations of this destructive and provocative action by Western imperialism. All of this has made West Berlin a powder keg that could explode into war at any time. Therefore, how to eliminate this source of war in the heart of Europe and ease tensions in Europe is one of the pressing international issues that needs to be resolved.

It is precisely because of this situation that the Soviet government formally notified the Western Three Powers on November 27 last year, suggesting that they end the Western occupation regime in West Berlin within six months and turn West Berlin into a demilitarized free city. The Soviet government took into account the lifestyle and social system formed by the residents of West Berlin under Western occupation. Therefore, it only demanded the withdrawal of Western troops and did not demand a change in the social system of West Berlin. The Soviet government declared and guaranteed that it would not interfere in the internal affairs of West Berlin and would help West Berlin develop its own economy. At that time, the German Democratic Republic, our government, and other socialist countries successively expressed their full support for this proposal by the Soviet government. The German Democratic Republic's agreement to grant this part of West Berlin, which should belong to its territory, the status of an independent city, is a major contribution to strengthening European peace and the national interests of all German people.

However, this Soviet proposal, which would help promote German reunification and European peace, aroused a chorus of opposition among the ruling groups in Western countries. In particular, the United States and the Adenauer government of West Germany, which has no relationship with West Berlin, were the loudest. They clamored "absolutely not to give up West Berlin," and for this, they would "not hesitate to resort to force," and so on. In order to achieve their goal of continuing to occupy West Berlin, Western countries disregarded historical facts and fabricated many reasons, insisting that they still have the "right" to occupy West Berlin now. What are the historical facts? In the fourteen years since the end of the war, the Western countries have actively armed West Germany, massively employed Nazi elements, dragged West Germany into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and used West Germany as a force to provoke the Soviet Union, an ally during the war. This has long brutally violated the Potsdam Agreement. At the same time, the situation in Germany has undergone fundamental changes. Two sovereign German states have emerged on German territory. The Four Powers have formally declared the end of the state of war with Germany, and the occupation of Germany has ended. Therefore, Western countries have completely lost any reason or "right" to continue occupying West Berlin.

When the Western countries were at a loss for words, they adopted another trick. They dared not openly reject the Soviet proposal to make West Berlin a free city, but attempted to entangle the West Berlin issue with the German reunification issue, thereby making the West Berlin issue impossible to resolve. Therefore, at that time, the Western countries put forward a so-called "counter-proposal" to discuss the entire German issue. However, when there are two sovereign states in Germany, the issue of German reunification is the internal affair of the two German peoples and can only be resolved through negotiations and consultations between the two German states. The only thing the Four Powers can do in this matter is to discuss and conclude a peace treaty with Germany as soon as possible to eliminate obstacles to German reunification and create an atmosphere conducive to understanding and rapprochement between the two German states. If the Four Powers discuss and conclude a peace treaty with Germany on the one hand, and discuss the urgent issue of abolishing the West Berlin occupation regime on the other, this will greatly promote the resolution of the German reunification issue. It is out of this consideration that the Soviet government, while proposing that the Four Powers discuss the West Berlin issue, also put forward a draft peace treaty with Germany. It also suggested convening a peace conference to discuss the issue of concluding a treaty. Then, in order to seek a speedy resolution of the issue and remove the excuses for Western countries to oppose the Soviet government's proposal, the Soviet government proposed on March 9: consideration can be given to the stationing of a small number of troops by the United States, Britain, France, the Soviet Union, or neutral countries in West Berlin to ensure the free status of West Berlin and prevent interference in West Berlin's internal affairs. The Soviet government also stated that it could consider other reasonable proposals put forward by Western countries. The Soviet government's repeated and unremitting efforts to seek peace and ease the international situation and the spirit of reconciliation it has shown have been welcomed and supported by world opinion.

Under the just advocacy of the Soviet government and the strong pressure of world public opinion, increasingly serious tactical differences have emerged among the Western "allies" and within the ruling groups of Western countries. Western countries, especially the United States and the Adenauer government, stubbornly adhered to the position of a "die-hard policy" and were in an increasingly isolated position both at home and abroad. In this situation, it is even more difficult for Western countries to hold on to their original rigid positions. As a result, they had no choice but to agree to hold a foreign ministers' meeting to negotiate with the Soviet Union. However, the United States, West Germany, and the French government were originally extremely unwilling to negotiate. Since the situation forced them to negotiate, they could only make a fuss about the negotiations. Therefore, before the Geneva East-West Foreign Ministers' Conference, the foreign ministers of Western countries traveled everywhere, holding frequent bilateral and multilateral talks, in order to formulate a plan to undermine the Soviet government's proposals on West Berlin and the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany at the Foreign Ministers' Conference. After several twists and turns, a so-called "package plan" reflecting the views of the United States and Adenauer was cobbled together on the eve of the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference. Later, at the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference on May 14, US Secretary of State Herter formally proposed it at the Foreign Ministers' Conference on behalf of the Western Three Powers. The Western propaganda machine once greatly exaggerated this "package plan," calling it a remarkable "peace plan," a "plan to guarantee European happiness," and so on.

However, according to the so-called "package plan" of Western countries, some mature and urgent issues, such as concluding a peace treaty with Germany and abolishing the West Berlin occupation regime, cannot be resolved separately and must depend on the resolution of the German reunification and European security issues. Western countries tied the West Berlin issue to these issues that cannot be resolved for the time being into a knot, and it is obvious that their purpose is not to resolve the West Berlin issue, continue to maintain the Western occupation, and maintain the sharp situation between the East and the West indefinitely. What is even more intolerable is that in the plan to resolve the Berlin issue, the West even brought out the tattered slogan of "free elections" on the issue of German reunification, saying that Berlin is a "single city that belongs to the whole of Germany. Therefore, East and West Berlin should be unified through free elections held under the supervision of the Four Powers or the United Nations." Before the whole of Berlin is unified, "the Four Powers will continue to have the right to station troops in Berlin as they do now." Obviously, in doing so, they dreamed of further expanding their occupation of West Berlin to East Berlin. This is a blatant act of infringing on the sovereignty of the German Democratic Republic. Therefore, the Western plan is completely unacceptable.

The unreasonable position of the Western countries was severely rejected and refuted by the representatives of the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic at the Geneva East-West Foreign Ministers' Conference, and was condemned by fair public opinion in various countries. The American "Wall Street Journal" reported that an American official in Geneva admitted: "We have no way to make American and world opinion understand the benefits of our peace plan." The British "Daily Mail" also frankly admitted: "The 'package plan' is finished." It was precisely under these circumstances that the representatives of the Western countries themselves had to quietly bury the "package plan" and attempt to undermine the Soviet proposal by new methods.

At the meeting on May 26, US Secretary of State Herter, on behalf of the Western countries, put forward a so-called seven-point plan to "unify" Berlin. This plan is no different from the plan for resolving West Berlin stipulated in the "package plan." However, this time the Western countries have picked out the West Berlin issue from the "package" as a "temporary agreement" before German reunification. According to this seven-point plan, the democratic district of Berlin in the German Democratic Republic and West Berlin "will be governed and administered as an indivisible region." The "governance and administration" will be carried out according to a "constitution" drafted by the "Constitutional Committee" elected by the "people of East and West Berlin" through "free elections" under the supervision of the Four Powers, and adopted by "referendum." At the same time, the plan also stipulates that "the Four Powers will continue to have the right to station troops in Berlin." Western countries even called this plan a model for "unifying" Germany. In order to defend this plan, the representatives of Western countries even absurdly insisted at the meeting that Berlin was not on the territory of the German Democratic Republic, but "an area jointly occupied by France, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union in 1945." They also said that "this city has always been and remains under the jurisdiction of the Four Powers." But unfortunately, all these reasons are untenable, and it can only expose the true face of Western countries' delusions of continuing to occupy Germany.

Western countries deliberately confused the essence of the West Berlin issue in their plan, calling it the problem of "unifying" Berlin. Everyone knows that the entire Berlin is part of the territory of the German Democratic Republic and is its capital. The current urgent issue is how to eliminate this tumor that endangers European peace, thereby easing international tensions and creating conditions for resolving European international issues. However, Western countries are unwilling to face the existence of the German Democratic Republic and its sovereignty over Berlin, and insist on pulling time back to the period of the Four Powers' occupation in the early post-war period. This shows that Western countries simply do not want to give up their occupation of West Berlin and even want to expand it to the democratic district of Berlin, so that the entire Berlin can become a stronghold for creating tensions, which of course will not work.

At the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference on May 30, Gromyko refuted this unreasonable demand of the Western countries. The Soviet government also proposed replacing the four-power agreement on Berlin, which was drafted during the war, with a new agreement conducive to consolidating European peace. The Soviet government proposed that the Four Powers sign special documents to guarantee the free city status of West Berlin and jointly form a supervisory body with the German Democratic Republic. The Soviet Union also proposed that symbolic troops from the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union be stationed in West Berlin, or that a limited number of troops from neutral countries replace the troops from the United States, Britain, and France in West Berlin. At the Foreign Ministers' Conference on June 2, Foreign Minister Bolz of the German Democratic Republic reiterated his support for the Soviet proposal and stated that the German Democratic Republic is willing to provide economic support to West Berlin after it becomes a free city, ensure smooth traffic between West Berlin and the outside world, and is also willing to conclude a guarantee treaty to protect the free city status of West Berlin from infringement. This is another manifestation of the sincere efforts of the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic to seek a solution to the West Berlin issue.

People all over the world are closely watching the progress of the Geneva Conference, expecting the conference to make due contributions to the conclusion of a peace treaty and the resolution of the West Berlin status issue.

    割除西柏林这个毒瘤
    姚念赓
    柏林是德意志民主共和国的首都，但是它的西半部分（即西柏林，人口约为二百二十万），在战后以来的十四年中，一直处于西方三国军事占领状态下，这个现象是极不正常的。
    这个红色海洋中的白色孤岛，目前已经成为西方进行冷战的“前线城市”。三国驻军共约一万二千人，另有警察一万九千三百名，警察局的官员有32％是前纳粹分子和前秘密警察。其他军事机构、特务组织更是名目繁多，它们专门向德意志民主共和国派遣特务，进行颠覆活动。类似希特勒时代“钢盔团”的军国主义组织有七十四个，另有许多电力很强的电台（如里亚斯电台），每天不停地向德意志民主共和国进行复仇主义的宣传，叫嚣战争，煽动破坏活动。同时挑拨和诬蔑性的传单、小册子也不时被附在气球上从西柏林向德意志民主共和国各地散发。很明显，西方继续霸占西柏林的目的已经不像当初确定四国共管柏林协议中所规定的监督和消除德国军国主义势力，而是为了把它作为向德意志民主共和国和其他社会主义国家进行敌对活动的基地，从而加剧欧洲的紧张局势。1948年6月的“柏林事件”和1953年6月17日的柏林骚乱，就是西方帝国主义这种破坏和挑衅行动的最露骨的表现。这一切已经使西柏林成为一个随时可能爆发战争的火药库。因此如何消除在欧洲中心的这一战争策源地，缓和欧洲的紧张局势，是目前迫切需要解决的国际问题之一。
    正是由于这种情况，苏联政府在去年11月27日正式照会西方三国建议在六个月内结束西方对西柏林的占领制度，把西柏林变成一个非军事化的自由城市。苏联政府考虑到西柏林居民在西方占领下所形成的生活方式和社会制度，因此只提出要求西方撤军，并不要求改变西柏林社会制度。苏联政府声明并保证不干涉西柏林内政，并帮助西柏林发展自己的经济。当时德意志民主共和国和我国政府及其他社会主义国家都先后表示完全支持苏联政府这一建议。德意志民主共和国同意给予这个理应属于它领土一部分的西柏林以独立城市的地位，是为了加强欧洲和平、为了全体德国人民的全民族利益而作出的重大贡献。
    但是苏联这一有助于促进德国重新统一和欧洲和平的建议，却在西方国家的统治集团中引起了一阵叫嚣。特别是美国和甚至与西柏林毫无关系的西德阿登纳政府叫得最凶。它们叫嚣“绝对不放弃西柏林”，为此还“不惜诉诸武力”等等。为了达到它们继续占领西柏林的目的，西方国家不顾历史真相，编造出许多理由，硬说他们现在仍然有占领西柏林的“权利”。历史事实是怎样的呢？在战后的十四年中，由于西方国家积极武装西德，大量起用纳粹分子，把西德拉入北大西洋公约组织，把西德作为对战时的盟国苏联进行挑衅的力量。这就早已粗暴地破坏了波茨坦协定。同时德国的情况已经起了根本性的变化，在德国的领土上出现了两个拥有主权的德国，四大国早已正式宣布结束对德战争状态，对德国的占领已经结束，因此西方国家已经完全丧失了继续占领西柏林的任何理由或“权利”了。
    西方国家在理屈词穷之余，采取了另一个花招，他们不敢公开拒绝苏联关于使西柏林成为自由城市的建议，但是却企图把西柏林问题同德国重新统一问题纠缠起来，从而使西柏林问题不得解决。因此当时西方国家提出了一个所谓讨论整个德国问题的“反建议”。但是当德国存在两个主权的国家的情况下，德国统一问题是两个德国人民的内政，只能通过两个德国的谈判和协商来解决。四大国在这个问题上所能尽力的就是尽早讨论和缔结对德和约，以消除阻挠德国重新统一的障碍，创造有利于两个德国谅解和接近的气氛。四大国如果一方面讨论和缔结对德和约，同时又讨论迫切的废除西柏林占领制度问题，这将会大大促进德国重新统一问题的解决。正是出于这种考虑，苏联政府在建议四大国讨论西柏林问题的同时，又提出了对德和约草案。并建议召开和会讨论缔结和约问题。接着苏联政府为了求得问题的尽速解决，解除西方国家反对苏联政府的建议的借口，于3月9日又提出：可以考虑由美、英、法、苏四大国或中立国在西柏林驻扎少数军队以保证西柏林自由化地位，使西柏林内政不受干涉。苏联政府还表示可以考虑西方国家提出的其它合理的方案。苏联政府这种一而再、再而三地为谋求和平和缓和国际局势所作的不懈努力和表现出的和解精神，获得了全世界舆论的欢迎和支持。
    在苏联政府的正义主张和全世界强烈的舆论压力下，西方“盟国”之间和西方国家的统治集团中出现了愈来愈严重的策略上的分歧。西方国家特别是美国和阿登纳政府顽固地坚持
  “死硬政策”的立场，在国内外处于日益孤立的境地。在这种情况下，西方国家要想坚守原来的僵硬阵地是更加困难了。于是它们不得不被迫答应同意举行外长会议来和苏联谈判了。但是美国、西德以及法国政府对于谈判本来是极不愿意的。既然形势逼得非谈判不行，那末只有在谈判上做文章了。因此，在日内瓦东西方外长会议之前，西方国家的外长们，仆仆风尘地到处奔波，举行了频繁的双边和多边会谈，以便拟订出在外长会议上破坏苏联政府提出的关于西柏林和缔结对德和约的计划。经过几次往返周折，终于在日内瓦外长会议前夕，一个反映美国和阿登纳主张的所谓“一揽子计划”就拼拼凑凑地出笼了。之后，在5月14日的日内瓦外长会议上，美国国务卿赫脱就代表西方三国正式在外长会议上提出来了。对于这个“一揽子计划”，西方宣传机器曾经大为吹嘘了一番，说是什么了不起的“和平计划”、“保障欧洲幸福的计划”等等。
    但根据西方国家的所谓“一揽子计划”，缔结对德和约和取消西柏林占领制度这样一些已经成熟、迫待解决的问题不能单独解决，必须取决于德国重新统一和欧洲安全问题的解决。西方国家把西柏林问题和这些一时不能解决的问题纠缠成一个死结，很明显，其目的就是不要解决西柏林问题，继续保持西方的占领状态，把东西方之间的尖锐局面无限期保持下去。更令人不能容忍的是，西方在这个计划内提出解决柏林问题的方案中，甚至又拿出了在德国统一问题上的“自由选举”的破烂口号，说什么柏林是一个“单一的城市，它属于整个德国。因此，东西柏林应该通过在四国或者联合国监督下举行的自由选举实现统一”。而在整个柏林未实现统一以前，“四国将继续像目前那样有权在柏林驻扎军队”。显然，它们这样做是梦想把它们对西柏林的占领进一步扩大到东柏林去，这是明目张胆地侵犯德意志民主共和国的主权的行为。因此西方的方案是根本不能考虑的。
    西方国家的这种无理的立场在日内瓦东西方外长会议上，遭到了苏联和德意志民主共和国的代表的严正拒绝和驳斥，并受到了世界各国公正舆论的申斥。美国“华尔街日报”报道，日内瓦的一位美国官员承认：“我们根本没有能使美国和世界各地舆论了解我们和平计划的好处”。英国“每日邮报”也直认不讳说：“一揽子计划”已经完蛋了。正是在这种情况下，西方国家的代表自己也不得不悄悄地把“一揽子计划”埋葬起来，企图用新的方法来破坏苏联的建议。
    5月26日会议上，美国国务卿赫脱又代表西方国家提出了一项所谓“统一”柏林的七点计划。这个计划跟“一揽子计划”中所规定的解决西柏林的方案没有丝毫区别。不过这次西方国家是把西柏林问题从“一揽子”里面挑出来，作为在德国重新统一以前的一项“临时协议”。根据这个七点计划，德意志民主共和国的柏林民主区和西柏林“将作为一个不可分割的地区加以治理和管理”。而“治理和管理”则根据在四大国监督下，由“东西柏林人民”经过“自由选举”选出的“宪法委员会草拟”，并由“公民投票”通过的“宪法”来进行。同时这个计划还规定“四国继续有权在柏林驻军”。西方国家甚至把这个计划称为是“统一”德国的榜样。为了替这个计划辩护，西方国家的代表在会上甚至荒谬地硬说柏林不是在德意志民主共和国的领土上，而是“1945年由法国、英国、美国和苏联共同占领的一个地区。”它们还说什么“这个城市一直是而且仍然是受四国管辖的”。但是可惜这一切理由都站不住脚，它只能暴露西方国家妄想继续占领德国的真面目。
    西方国家在它们的计划中故意混淆了西柏林问题的实质，把它说成什么“统一”柏林的问题。谁都知道，整个柏林是德意志民主共和国的领土的一部分，是它的首都。当前的迫切问题是如何消除这个危害欧洲和平的毒瘤，从而缓和国际紧张局势，为解决欧洲的国际问题创造条件。但是西方国家却不愿正视德意志民主共和国的存在和它对柏林的主权，硬要把时间拉回到战后初期四大国的占领时期去。这说明西方国家根本不想放弃它们对西柏林的占领，而且还想把它扩大到柏林民主区去，以便使整个柏林成为制造紧张局势的据点，这当然是行不通的。
    在5月30日日内瓦外长会议上，葛罗米柯驳斥了西方国家这种无理要求。苏联政府并且又提出了用一项有利于巩固欧洲和平的新的协定代替在战时拟定的关于柏林的四国协定的建议。苏联政府主张四大国签署专门文件来保证西柏林的自由城市地位，并同德意志民主共和国共组监督机构。苏联并提出了由美、英、法和苏联在西柏林驻扎象征性部队，或由中立国家的有限额的军队来代替美、英、法在西柏林的军队。德意志民主共和国外长博尔茨在2日外长会议上重申支持苏联的建议，并表示德意志民主共和国愿在西柏林成为自由城市后，予以经济上的支持，保证西柏林同外界的交通畅通，还愿意缔结一项保证条约，使西柏林自由城市的地位不受侵犯。这是苏联和德意志民主共和国为谋求解决西柏林问题的真诚努力的又一表现。
    全世界人民都在密切注意日内瓦会议的进展，期待着会议能就缔结和约和解决西柏林地位问题作出应有的贡献。（附图片）
