Kishida Nobusuke's Reactionary Economic Policies
Lan Hai

I.

At present, the main trends dominating the world economy are the rapid development of the socialist world system, the historical collapse of the colonial system, and the deepening of the general crisis of the capitalist world system. The economic policies of Japanese monopoly capital, represented by the Kishida Nobusuke government, cannot but be profoundly influenced by these trends.

Maeda, the executive director of the "Japan Federation of Employers' Associations," the main organization of Japanese monopoly capital, made a report at the organization's recent regular conference, saying: "Recently, some people have been promoting the superiority of socialist economics, setting off the debate of 'capitalism or socialism'. Managers should face up to the crisis of capitalism, work hard to improve the Japanese economic system, and avoid repeating the failures caused by overheating the economy twice in the past."

Since March-May 1957, the Japanese economy has fallen into its fourth postwar crisis. If we don't count the economic crisis shortly after the defeat in 1945-1946, which was combined with a political crisis, then this crisis is considered the biggest postwar crisis. However, starting from the lowest point in January-March 1958, there was a rapid economic "recovery." Up to March of this year (excluding January), the average industrial and mining production index had exceeded the highest level before the crisis for three consecutive months; phenomena such as increased corporate profits, expanded trade volume, and increased equipment investment have appeared.

However, this is an extremely abnormal process. This economic "recovery" is not the result of fully resolving the various contradictions that caused the crisis, but is mainly promoted by the following conditions. First of all, state monopoly capitalism has played its role: measures such as issuing loans for unsalable goods, establishing cartels to reduce operating rates, and lowering official interest rates have been used to ease finance; state financial investment and loans and the import of foreign capital have been used to expand equipment investment. The state has also implemented an inflationary policy in conjunction with this. Secondly, in terms of foreign trade, it has adopted a countermeasure of relying on the US imperialist military aggression system, implementing dumping, and intensifying exploitation and attacks on the working class. Moreover, even when industrial and mining production exceeded the peak of the boom period last December, an average of 27.2% of Japanese manufacturing equipment was still idle. The inventory of products in the steel, chemical, and coal industries exceeded the level of the most severe period of the crisis.

The rapid growth of production has intensified the market problem and deepened the instability of the entire Japanese economy. After seasonal adjustments, the growth rate of the industrial and mining production index in February and March of this year is declining, and the rise in the wholesale price index is also sluggish. This fact shows that the Japanese economy can no longer maintain the same rate of increase as it did not long ago. In this case, the Kishida Nobusuke government is stepping up its reactionary economic policies, forcibly promoting the accumulation of capital by large monopolies subordinate to the United States; strengthening its foreign trade expansion policy; and attacking the working class. Through this reactionary economic policy, the Kishida Nobusuke government wants to lay the economic foundation for the aggressive Northeast Asian military alliance and accelerate the revival of Japanese militarism.

II.

The Kishida Nobusuke government is taking all means such as expanding the scale of fiscal investment and loans, reducing taxes, importing foreign capital, lowering the Bank of Japan's interest rate, and expanding credit to serve large monopoly capital. Encouraged by this policy, monopoly capital groups are starting new investment activities. According to data from the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, the total amount of private equipment investment planned for this year is 806.3 billion yen, an increase of 18% over the previous year. Among them, 700 billion yen is concentrated in large monopoly enterprises in electricity, steel, electrical machinery, petroleum, synthetic fibers, petrochemicals, and other important industries. In addition, investments have also been made in projects such as telegraph and telephone, railways, highways, and ports. These investments will greatly increase production capacity with the latest technology and equipment. For example, steel production capacity is expected to be twice that of 1956 in 1962, and the rolling capacity of automatic continuous rolling mills in 1960 will be 2.8 times that of 1956.

US imperialism is using this investment activity in Japan to open up markets for its own commodity exports and capital exports. According to Japanese government data, from 1949 to June 1958, the total amount of foreign investment approved by the Japanese government reached US$511.67 million. Among them, loans accounted for 87%, and were concentrated in electricity (47%), steel (11%), transportation and communications (11%), oil processing (16%), machinery manufacturing (7%), and construction (7%) and other business sectors. And these departments are the places where Japanese government fiscal investment and loans and bank loans are concentrated. US capital's "participation in management" and "technical assistance" are also concentrated in "promising industrial sectors" such as oil processing, synthetic fibers, petrochemicals, and electrical machinery. Japan has become an important export market for the United States, second only to Canada and the United Kingdom in importance. At the same time, Japan is gradually becoming a favorable investment location for the United States.

Recently, the "Federation of Economic Organizations," a nationwide organization of Japanese monopoly capitalists, has requested the government to relax the restrictions of the Foreign Capital Law in order to import American capital on a large scale. At this time, they openly stated that the purpose of doing so was to strengthen industrial production capacity in order to expand into the Southeast Asian region. Not only that, while stepping up the revision of the Japan-US "Security Treaty," the Kishida Nobusuke government is also eager to rely on US military technology to support Japan's military industry. Obviously, the Kishida Nobusuke government's policy aims to exert Japan's industrial capacity as an industrial-military base for US imperialism's aggression in Asia, while restoring Japan's imperialist expansion in Southeast Asia and realizing Japan's economic militarization.

This policy of the Kishida Nobusuke government will hinder the development of Japan's machinery manufacturing industry and force the decline of existing industrial sectors, such as the coal industry, the inherent chemical industry, cotton spinning, chemical fibers, and various mass consumer product production sectors. Now, the so-called "hot" industries combined with US imperialism are expanding rapidly, the monopoly of large monopoly organizations has been greatly strengthened, and the market problem has been further intensified.

III.

The increasingly serious struggle to seize the world market is the most serious problem in the capitalist world and the weakest link in Japanese capitalism. The Kishida Nobusuke government plays an important role in the US conspiracy to put together the "Northeast Asian Military Alliance." The Kishida Nobusuke government attempts to establish a sphere of influence with Southeast Asia as the center, restore Japan's imperialist expansion activities, and solve the market problem along this route.

To this end, Japanese monopoly capital groups are desperately expanding trade in Southeast Asian countries, implementing dumping. They are particularly keen on war reparations, yen loans, and "technical assistance." Recently, the Japanese government has also begun to study the use of the "Southeast Asia Development Fund" plan, which has been shelved. Among them, war reparations to Burma, Indonesia, the Philippines, and South Vietnam, and "donations" to Laos and Cambodia total US$1.012 billion. This is used by Japanese monopoly capital as an important bait to expand exports of heavy chemical industrial products and future capital exports. It is also conducive to American monopoly capital investing in Japanese heavy chemical industry. Japan's yen loans to India and other countries, "technical assistance" to the Mariquina Dam in the Philippines, the Rourkela Iron Mine and the Bailadila Iron Mine in India, are all carried out in direct cooperation with the United States.

However, even if the expansion policy of the Kishida Nobusuke government can achieve partial success, it will inevitably isolate Japan in Asia and eventually lead to bankruptcy from a fundamental point of view. For example, last year Japan expanded its export trade with the United States and Taiwan, South Korea, the Philippines, Pakistan, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and other countries and regions that have US military bases and receive US military assistance as the center. However, Japan's exports to several other major countries in Asia and Africa have been greatly reduced. Following the severance of Sino-Japanese trade, Japan recently interrupted trade with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Asian and African countries and Latin American countries such as India, Indonesia, Burma, the United Arab Republic, and Brazil, however, restrict the import of Japanese goods. This is because the Kishida Nobusuke government wants to carry out unequal trade with these countries with unilateral excess exports in order to make up for its huge deficit in Japan-US trade, and it also wants to use its creditor status to build a bridge for expansion into these countries; but this specter of the "Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere" has aroused the vigilance of Southeast Asian countries.

IV.

With the intensification of the struggle to seize the world market, Japanese monopoly capital relies on low wages, increased labor intensity, and "industrial rationalization" to implement dumping. As a result, the working class has suffered huge sacrifices.

The implementation of "industrial rationalization" by Japanese monopoly capital is a characteristic of its recent attacks on the working class. The so-called "industrial rationalization" is, on the one hand, maintaining the exploitation system based on Japan's unique low-wage system and the powerlessness of the working masses. On the other hand, it has increased the new exploitation system using American-made automated machines. Japanese monopoly capital has imported various new American exploitation systems such as the speed-up system and piece-rate wage system from the United States. Monopoly capitalists vigorously promote that increasing labor productivity is "beneficial" to workers, and strive to make trade unions tools for capitalists. At the same time, old-fashioned enterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises are doing their best to lower wages and increase labor intensity to compete with them. As various enterprises implement large-scale job transfers, deprivation of workers' rights, and reduction of workers' skills, the problems of unemployment and poverty are becoming more and more serious. With the implementation of "industrial rationalization," sectors such as textiles, coal, shipping, and chemicals are laying off workers, closing factories, and lowering wages on a large scale.

Last year, the Kishida Nobusuke government wanted to revise the "Police Duties Law" in order to establish a reactionary system adapted to the new exploitation system at home. Although this attempt failed, it is by no means willing to give up and is stepping up activities to revise the "Security Treaty."

The Japanese working class is fighting for higher wages, the establishment of a minimum wage system and social security system, the solution of unemployment and poverty, the protection of the freedom and rights of the workers' movement, the protection of democratic education, and the opposition to "industrial rationalization." The Japanese labor movement has made progress in the spring struggle and is now carrying out the summer struggle. More importantly, the broad masses of the Japanese people are uniting to stop the revision and strive for the abolition of the Japan-US "Security Treaty" and to defend peace. The Kishida Nobusuke government's reactionary policies have further intensified national and class contradictions.

    岸信介的反动的经济政策
    蓝海
    一
    目前，支配世界经济的主要趋向，是社会主义世界体系突飞猛进的发展、殖民制度的历史性的崩溃和资本主义世界体系总危机的深刻化。以岸信介政府为代表的日本垄断资本的经济政策，也不能不受到这种趋势的深刻影响。
    日本垄断资本的主要组织“日本经营者团体联盟”专务理事前田，在该组织最近一次定期大会上作了报告，他说：“最近，有人在宣扬社会主义经济的优越性，掀起了‘是资本主义还是社会主义’的争论。经营者应该正视资本主义的危机，努力改善日本经济的体制，勿使过去两度因景气过热而招致的失败重演。”
    自从1957年3—5月以来，日本经济又陷入了战后第四次危机。如果不算1945—1946年战败后不久爆发的那次同政治危机相结合的经济危机，那末这次危机要算是战后最大的一次危机。但是，以1958年1—3月为最低点，出现了快速度的经济“回升”的局面。迄今年3月为止（不包括1月份），工矿业的平均生产指数，已经一连有三个月超过了危机前夕的最高水准；出现了企业利润增加、贸易额扩大，以及设备投资增加等现象。
    但是，这是一个极为变态的过程。这种经济“回升”不是充分地解决引起危机的各种矛盾的结果，而主要是由下面一些条件促成的。这首先是国家垄断资本主义发挥了它的职能：以发放滞销货贷款、建立减缩开工率的卡迭尔制，降低公定利率等办法缓和金融；以国家财政投资放款和输入外国资本，来扩大设备投资。国家还实行了与此相结合的通货膨胀政策。其次，是在对外贸易方面采取依附美帝国主义军事侵略体制的对策，实行倾销，对工人阶级加紧剥削和进攻。而且，就在工矿业生产超过繁荣期顶点的去年12月，日本制造工业设备平均还有27.2％处在闲置状态。钢铁、化学及煤炭工业的产品库存，超过了危机最深刻时期的水准。
    生产的迅速增长，促使市场问题趋于尖锐化，加深了整个日本经济的不稳定局面。今年2月和3月工矿业生产指数，对季节性的变动经过核正后，回升速度是在下降，批发物价指数也上升滞缓。这一事实说明，日本经济已经不能再保持像不久前那样的上升速度了。在这种情况下，岸信介政府又极力加强反动的经济政策，强制推行对美从属的大垄断资本的积累；加强对外贸易扩张政策；向工人阶级进攻。岸信介政府想通过这种反动的经济政策，为侵略的东北亚军事同盟奠定经济基础，加紧复活日本军国主义。
    二
    岸信介政府正在采取扩大财政投资放款规模、减税、输入外国资本、降低日本银行利率，以及扩大信贷等一切手段，为大垄断资本效劳。垄断资本集团，在这种政策的鼓励下，着手从事新的投资活动。根据通商产业省的资料，今年度的私人设备投资计划总额达八千零六十三亿日元，比上一年度增加18％。其中，七千亿日元集中投在电力、钢铁、电气机械、石油、合成纤维、石油化学及其他重要产业的大垄断企业。此外，对于电报电话、铁路、公路及港湾等工程，也进行了投资。这些投资将以最新的技术设备，大大增加生产能力。例如，钢铁生产能力预计1962年度将为1956年度的二倍，而1960年度的自动连续压延机的压延能力将为1956年度的二点八倍。
    美帝国主义正在利用日本的这种投资活动，为自己开辟商品输出和资本输出的市场。根据日本政府的资料，从1949年到1958年6月这段时间里，经日本政府批准的外国投资总计达五亿一千一百六十七万美元。其中贷款占87％，而且集中在电力（47％）、钢铁（11％）、运输和通讯（11％）、石油加工（16％）、机器制造（7％）和建筑业（7％）等企业部门。而这些部门正是集中了日本政府财政投资放款和银行放款的地方。美国资本的“参加经营”和“技术援助”，也集中在石油加工、合成纤维、石油化学及电器机械等“有发展前途的产业部门”。日本已成了美国的重要出口市场，其重要性仅次于加拿大和英国。同时，日本又正在逐渐变成美国的一个有利的投资场所。
    最近，日本垄断资本家的全国性组织“经济团体联合会”，为了大规模地输入美国资本，要求政府放宽外资法案的限制。就在这个时候，他们公开地说这样做的目的是为了加强工业生产能力，以便向东南亚地区扩张。不仅如此，岸信介政府在加紧修改日美“安全条约”的同时，还急于要靠美国的军事技术来扶植日本的军需工业。显然，岸信介政府的政策的企图，在于发挥作为美帝国主义侵略亚洲的工业—军事基地的日本的工业能力，同时恢复日本对东南亚地区的帝国主义扩张和实现日本的经济军事化。
    岸信介政府的这一政策，将妨碍日本机器制造工业的发展，并迫使原有的产叶部门，如煤炭工业、固有的化学工业、棉纺、化学纤维和各种群众消费品的生产部门衰落下去。现在，同美帝国主义结合的所谓“热门”产业正在急剧膨胀，大垄断组织的独占大大加强，市场问题也进一步尖锐化了。
    三
    日益严重的争夺世界市场的斗争，是资本主义世界最严重的问题，也是日本资本主义最薄弱的一环。岸信介政府在美国策划拼凑“东北亚军事同盟”的阴谋活动中，扮演着重要的角色。岸信介政府企图以东南亚为中心建立势力范围，恢复日本帝国主义的扩张活动，并且沿着这条路线来解决市场问题。
    为此，日本垄断资本集团拼命地在以东南亚国家为中心扩大贸易，实行倾销。尤其是在战争赔偿、日元贷款和“技术援助”等方面特别卖力气。最近，日本政府又开始研究利用已经被搁置起来的“东南亚开发基金”计划。其中，对缅甸、印度尼西亚、菲律宾、南越的战争赔偿和对老挝、柬埔寨的“赠予”等，总计达十亿一千二百万美元。这却被日本垄断资本用来扩大重化学工业制品出口和将来的资本输出的重要钓饵。同时也有利于向日本重化学工业投资的美国垄断资本。日本对印度及其它国家的日元贷款、对菲律宾的玛利坚那水坝及印度鲁克拉铁矿和巴依拉吉拉铁矿等的“技术援助”，都是在同美国直接合作之下进行的。
    然而，岸信介政府的这种扩张政策，即使能收到局部的成效，但从根本上说来必然使日本在亚洲陷于孤立而最后招致破产。例如，去年日本以美国及台湾、南朝鲜、菲律宾、巴基斯坦、泰国、马来亚、新加坡等有美国军事基地和接受美国军事援助的国家和地区为中心，扩大了出口贸易。但日本向亚非其他几个主要国家的出口则大大地缩减了。继中日贸易断绝之后，最近日本又中断了同越南民主共和国的贸易。印度、印度尼西亚、缅甸、阿联和巴西等亚非国家及拉丁美洲国家，却限制日货的进口。这是因为岸信介政府想对这些国家进行单方面出超的不平等贸易，来弥补它在日美贸易中的巨大赤字，而且它还想以债权国地位，为向这些国家实行扩张搭桥；但这个“东亚共荣圈”的幽灵引起了东南亚国家的警惕。
    四
    随着争夺世界市场斗争激化，日本垄断资本依靠低工资制、加强劳动强度和“产业合理化”实行倾销，结果工人阶级遭到巨大牺牲。
    日本垄断资本实行“产业合理化”，是最近它向工人阶级进攻的一个特征。所谓“产业合理化”，就是一方面维持以日本所特有的低工资制和工人群众无权无势为基础的剥削制度。另一方面，又增加了使用美制自动化机器的新剥削制度。日本垄断资本从美国输入了赶快制度、工种工资制等等各种新的美式剥削制度。垄断资本家大肆宣传提高劳动生产率对工人“有利”，并且力图使工会成为资本家御用的工具。同时，旧式企业和中小企业，则极力压低工资和加强劳动强度来同它们竞争。由于各企业实行大规模的调换工人工种、剥夺工人权利及降低工人熟练程度等等，失业和贫困问题一天比一天严重了。纺织、煤炭、海运、化学等部门随着实行“产业合理化”，正在大批解雇工人、关厂和降低工人工资。
    去年岸信介政府想修改“警职法”，以便在国内建立一个同新的剥削制度相适应的反动体制。这个企图虽然失败了，但它决不甘心放弃，并正在加紧进行修改“安全条约”的活动。
    日本工人阶级正在为要求提高工资、确立最低工资制和社会保障制度、解决失业和贫困、维护工人运动的自由和权利、维护民主教育以及反对“产业合理化”等等而进行斗争。日本工人运动在春季斗争中已取得了进展，现在正在开展夏季斗争。更重要的是，日本的广大人民正在团结起来，阻止修改和争取废除日美“安全条约”、保卫和平。岸信介政府的反动政策，进一步使民族矛盾和阶级矛盾激化了。
