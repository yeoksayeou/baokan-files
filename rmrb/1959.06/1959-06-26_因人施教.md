    Teaching According to Aptitude
    Zu Nian
    Today, this newspaper publishes two news items: the Nanchang Diesel Engine Factory's persistence in running a good workers' spare-time school for seven years, and the Changchun Municipal Engineering Office's development of workers' spare-time education. These illustrate that in implementing the principle of education serving production, worker education can be run for a long time and run well by taking into account the characteristics of production and teaching according to aptitude. The production positions at the diesel engine factory are relatively fixed, while the positions at the municipal engineering office are more fluid; these are the characteristics of production. Technical workers, municipal workers, apprentices, or middle-aged, adult workers, and young workers all have their own characteristics. By grasping these two characteristics and taking corresponding measures, it is possible to run worker spare-time education for a long time and well.
    Running worker spare-time education cannot simply transplant a set of methods from ordinary schools. Even among factory worker spare-time schools, situations differ, and mechanical transplantation should not be used. Therefore, it is necessary to determine different teaching content, teaching methods, learning times, etc., based on various production realities and worker characteristics. Of course, in teaching, attention should also be paid to appropriately increasing basic theoretical knowledge related to production knowledge, such as language, mathematics, physics, and chemistry courses, to avoid simply "learning whatever is needed." Sun Fuping, a worker at the Nanchang Diesel Engine Factory, improved precision measuring instruments with his mathematical foundation, increasing work efficiency by twenty times. It can be seen that once workers master basic theories, they can continuously innovate in production technology, develop productive forces, and improve labor productivity. A major aspect of running worker spare-time education is paying attention to cultivating and improving the work of teachers. Various places in Jiangsu have taken various measures to cultivate teachers for worker spare-time education, providing experience in this area. Currently, among the teachers engaged in worker spare-time education in factories and mines, most are full-time teachers, in addition to some part-time ones. Among the full-time teachers, some have been engaged in ordinary education work for many years and have relatively systematic experience in teaching. These experiences cannot be fully applied to adult education. This requires further improvement. At the same time, spare-time education is developing rapidly, and there is a great shortage of teachers, which requires cultivating as many new teachers as possible. Various places in Jiangsu conduct training according to the different characteristics of part-time and full-time teachers; the Yangzhou Municipal Workers' Spare-time Normal School conducts teaching according to the principle of "teach what is needed, learn what is needed; supplement what is lacking." These are all ways to cultivate and improve teachers for worker spare-time education. These measures and methods are also "teaching according to aptitude" and can be promoted.

    因人施教
    祖年
    今天本报发表的南昌柴油机厂坚持七年办好职工业余学校和长春市政工程处开展职工业余教育两条新闻，说明了职工教育在贯彻教育为生产服务的原则下，根据生产特点和因人施教，就能办长办好。柴油机厂的生产岗位较固定，市政工程的岗位较流动，是生产的特点；技术工人、市政工人、学徒，或壮年、成年工人、青年工人，等等，也各有特点。掌握了这两个特点，采取相应的各种措施，就有可能把职工业余教育办得长办得好。
    办职工业余教育，不能单纯地搬运普通学校的一套。即使在工厂职工业余学校之间，情况也有不同，也不能机械搬用。因此，必须从各种生产实际和工人特点来确定不同的教学内容、教学方法、学习时间，等等。当然，在教学中还须注意相应地增加同生产知识有关的基础理论知识，如语文、数学、物理、化学等课程，以避免单纯地“做什么学什么”。南昌柴油机厂工人孙富平有了数学基础，改进了精密测量仪器，提高了工效二十倍。可见工人一旦掌握了基础理论，就能够在生产技术上不断革新，发展生产力，提高劳动生产率。办职工业余教育的主要一个环节是注意培养提高教师的工作。江苏各地采取各种措施培养职工业余教育师资，提供了这一方面的经验。目前，从事工厂矿山职工业余教育的教师，除一部分是兼职的以外，大部是专职教师。在专职教师中，有的是多年从事普通教育工作的，在教学上较有系统经验。这些经验不能完全适用于成人教育。这就需要进一步提高。同时，业余教育发展很快，师资很缺，这就需要尽多地培养新的师资。江苏各地按照兼职和专职教师的不同特点进行培训；扬州市职工业余师范根据“教什么，学什么；缺什么，补什么”的原则进行教学，都是培养提高职工业余教育师资的种种办法之一。这些措施和办法，也是“因人施教”，可以提倡。
