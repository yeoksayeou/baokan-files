Shanxi Expands Sown Area and Improves Planting Quality
Jiangsu Rushes to Plant High-Yield Crops Such as Rice and Sweet Potatoes

(Our newspaper, Taiyuan, 24th) Shanxi is actively implementing the policy of "more planting and more harvesting" and "simultaneous large-area high-yield and high-production," and has achieved great results. The province's spring sowing area has reached more than 41 million mu, exceeding the national plan by 5%, an increase of more than 3 million mu. Including wheat fields and replanting areas, the province's sown area is more than 60 million mu, equivalent to last year's total sown area. These increased lands have generally been deep-plowed by two to four inches more than in previous years, and the base fertilizer has been increased by half to more than double. Rational close planting has been implemented, and seedling management is relatively meticulous. The area of large-area high-yield fields has also increased compared with last year, totaling more than 4 million mu. These high-yield fields have been deep-plowed by one to three feet, with more than 10,000 jin of base fertilizer, achieving the goal of "field ridges like lines and soil as fine as flour."

Shanxi Province has many mountains and vast land. Last year, the province piloted a basic farmland system, changing shallow and extensive farming into deep and intensive farming, and the unit yield per mu increased sharply. The total output in some areas also increased accordingly. The Yanbei area, known for its low yield throughout the country, was previously believed to be unsuitable for high yield due to strong winds, abundant sand, cold weather, and cold land. However, last year the face of the low-yield area changed greatly. Many areas with a yield of 40, 50, or 80 jin per mu in the past actually saw large-area high-yield records of 400, 500, and 800 jin per mu. In addition, other areas with traditionally high yields have also seen typical examples of high yields becoming even higher. After top-down investigations and research, and bottom-up discussions and summaries, the Party committees at all levels generally affirmed that less planting and high-yield more harvesting is the direction for future production development. The experience of the past year has confirmed that many conditions are not yet in place to immediately abandon a large amount of cultivated land and implement less planting. For example, in Jinbei area, which suffers from drought nine years out of ten and has extensive farming practices and a lack of fertilizer, although water conservancy construction has developed unprecedentedly in recent years and the irrigated area has reached 8 million mu, it still cannot control drought. At the same time, mechanization cannot be achieved in the short term, and chemical fertilizer cannot meet the needs, making it difficult to guarantee that all cultivated land will achieve high yields. In particular, in wheat-producing areas such as southern Shanxi, after some communes reduced the area of wheat fields last year, although the unit yield per mu of wheat has greatly increased this year, the total output has not increased much. All of these indicate that less planting and high-yield more harvesting cannot be achieved overnight. On the contrary, expanding the existing cultivated area and planting more can guarantee a comprehensive great leap forward in the production of grain, cotton, and oil, which is in line with the current production realities and the needs of the masses. Therefore, all localities are focusing on more planting and more harvesting in this year's summer planting.

In order to establish production pacesetters for various crops, summarize experience, guide comprehensive production, ensure high yields in a certain area, and actively create conditions for gradually realizing less planting and high-yield more harvesting, all localities are focusing on the movement of large-area high-yield fields while grasping multiple plantings, absorbing the experience of large-area high yields over the years, fixing a certain proportion of cultivated land, and establishing high-yield fields.

(Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd) Jiangsu Province is striving for an all-round victory in the summer harvest and summer planting, and is carrying out the "three no's" movement of "not losing a grain of grain, not wasting a mu of land, and not missing a seedling."

In the past half month, Jiangsu Province's more than 35 million mu of summer-ripe crops have been basically harvested, and 54% has been threshed. More than 40 million mu of summer-planted crops have also been rushed to plant nearly 20 million mu. In the summer harvest, all localities have paid close attention to grasping several links such as harvesting, transportation, and threshing to achieve fine harvesting and meticulous beating. Huaiyin Prefecture has arranged 20% of the labor force to be in charge of threshing, and each commune, brigade, and production team has a secretary or captain to lead the threshing work. Some places have established grain protection committees and field acceptance teams to check the wheat piles stacked on the fields and in the fields to prevent fever and mold. All localities also pay special attention to quality in threshing to ensure thorough threshing, winnowing, and sweeping.

According to the requirement of not wasting a mu of land, all localities first tried every means to expand the area of high-yield grain crops such as rice and sweet potatoes. The province has planted 3.4 million mu of early rice, an increase of more than 1 million mu compared with last year. Areas that have acted faster have completed the transplanting of mid-season rice. The transplanting of late rice has also begun in full swing.

All localities are also paying attention to seizing the opportunity to sow oil crops such as soybeans, sesame, and peanuts.

All localities have taken various measures in planting to solve the difficulties brought about by the expansion of the sown area, such as seedlings, fertilizers, and labor. Communes and production teams are constantly conducting queuing in the summer planting to identify problems as early as possible and take immediate measures. After discovering a shortage of seedlings, Kunshan County immediately consulted with the masses and adopted methods such as strengthening the management of seedling fields, organizing the transfer of surplus seedlings, and replanting in time, which not only solved the shortage of seedlings in the original 15,000 mu of rice, but also expanded the rice area by more than 5,000 mu. All localities are paying attention to improving the quality of sowing while expanding the sowing area and seizing the agricultural season.

    多种——充分利用土地
    种好——保证苗全苗壮
    山西扩大播种面积提高播种质量
    江苏正赶种水稻甘薯等高产作物
    本报太原24日电　山西各地积极贯彻多种多收和大面积高额丰产同时实行的方针，已经取得很大的成绩。全省春播面积已达到四千一百多万亩，超过国家计划5％，多种了三百多万亩；连同麦田和复种面积，全省播种面积在六千万亩以上，相当于去年的总播种面积。这些增种的土地，一般都比往年深耕了二至四寸，底肥增加半倍至一倍以上，实行了合理密植，苗期管理也比较细致。各地大面积高额丰产田也比去年增多，共计四百多万亩。这些高额丰产田都深耕了一至三尺，底肥在万斤以上，作到了地埂如线，土碎像面。
    山西省山区多，土地广阔。去年全省范围内试行基本农田制，变浅耕粗作为深耕细作，单位亩产量有了急剧提高，部分地区的总产量也有相应增加。以低产闻名全国的雁北地区，过去人们一直认为风多沙多，天寒地冷，不能高产。但是去年低产区面貌大大改变，许多过去亩产四十、五十、八十斤的地区，居然出现了亩产四百、五百、八百斤的大面积高产纪录。另外，其他历来产量较高的地区也出现了高产变更高的典型。各级党委经过自上而下调查研究，和自下而上的讨论总结，普遍肯定少种高产多收是今后发展生产的方向。一年来的经验证实，马上弃耕大量耕地，实行少种，有许多条件还不具备。如十年九旱，耕作粗放，肥料缺乏的晋北地区，几年来水利建设虽然空前发展，灌溉面积达到八百万亩，但是还不能控制干旱；同时，短期还不能实现机械化，化肥还不能满足需要，这样就很难保证全部耕地都实现高产。特别是晋南等产麦区，有些公社去年缩小麦田面积后，今年小麦单位亩产虽有很大提高，但总产增长不多。所有这些，都说明少种高产多收不能急于求成。相反，扩大现有耕地面积，多种多收，既符合当前生产实际和群众要求，又能保证粮、棉、油各项生产全面大跃进。因此，今年各地在夏种中都大抓多种多收。
    为了树立各项作物生产标兵，总结经验，指导全面生产，保证在一定面积上高产，并积极地为逐步实现少种高产多收创造条件，各地在抓多种的同时，又大抓大面积高额丰产田运动，吸收历年大面积高产的经验，固定了一定比例的耕地，建立了高产田。
    据新华社南京23日电　江苏省各地力争夏收夏种的全面胜利，正开展“不丢一粒粮，不荒一亩地，不缺一株苗”的“三不”运动。
    半个多月来，江苏全省三千五百多万亩夏熟作物，已基本上收完，并且已脱粒54％；四千多万亩夏种作物也已抢种近二千万亩。各地在夏收中，十分注意抓紧收、运、脱粒等几个环节，做到精收细打。淮阴专区安排了20％的劳动力专管打场，每个公社、大队和生产队有一个书记或队长领导脱粒工作。有的地方成立保粮委员会、场头验收小组，检查堆在场上和田头的麦堆，防止发热霉烂。各地在脱粒中还特别注意质量，做到脱净、扬净、扫净。
    根据不荒一亩地的要求，各地首先是千方百计地扩大水稻、山芋等高产粮食作物面积，全省早稻已经种了三百四十万亩，比去年扩大一百多万亩。行动较快的地区，已结束中稻移栽工作。晚稻移栽工作也已全面开始。
    各地也很注意抓紧时机播种大豆、芝麻、花生等油料作物。
    各地在播种中采取各种措施，解决由于扩大播种面积所带来的种苗、肥料、劳力等方面的困难。各公社和生产队在夏种中不断地进行排队，及早发现问题，立即采取措施。昆山县发现缺秧后，立即跟群众商量，采取加强秧田管理，组织余秧调剂和及时补种等办法，不仅解决了原来一万五千亩水稻的缺秧困难，还可以再扩大水稻面积五千多亩。各地在扩大播种面积、抓农时的同时，注意提高播种质量。
