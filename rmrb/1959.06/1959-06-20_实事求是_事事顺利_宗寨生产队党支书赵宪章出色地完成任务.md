Seeking Truth from Facts Leads to Smooth Success
Zongzhai Production Team Party Branch Secretary Zhao Xianzhang Excellently Completes Tasks

    This reporter, Miu Yiqin, reports: The Party Committee members of Heshangqiao People's Commune in Changge County, Henan Province, all say with joy whenever they mention the Zongzhai Production Team of their commune: This team's work is always ahead of others, production tasks are completed well, and all aspects of work are outstanding.
    Why is the Zongzhai Production Team able to complete its tasks so well? It is inseparable from the excellent quality of seeking truth from facts by Zhao Xianzhang, the Party Branch Secretary of this team.
 Report the Good as Good, the Bad as Bad
 Avoiding False Reputation and Striving for Practical Results

    Zhao Xianzhang always proceeds from his own actual situation in doing any work. He will definitely try his best to do things that can be accomplished through subjective effort, and he always puts forward different opinions based on the actual situation for things that cannot be accomplished through subjective effort. At the beginning of April this year, when spring sowing began, the Party Committee of Heshangqiao People's Commune required all brigades to complete the corn sowing task before April 5th. Zhao Xianzhang analyzed the actual situation of his team: Three hundred and sixty mu of corn land had not been completely plowed because there was no tractor, and there was a particularly large accumulation of fertilizer. It would be difficult to plow the land, apply fertilizer, and sow the seeds before April 5th, even if the commune members did not sleep or rest. It was estimated that it would take until April 7th at the earliest to finish planting. At that time, some individuals were afraid of "falling behind others" and advocated applying less fertilizer and rushing to finish planting before April 5th. However, Zhao Xianzhang disagreed. He thought that leading the masses in production should not be for false reputation or to show off, but should strive for practical results. If the fertilizer is not applied, even if it is planted two days earlier, the corn will not grow well, and it will be in vain. Being two days late does not violate the farming season, and the corn can grow better. On the one hand, he persuaded and educated these individuals, and on the other hand, he put forward his opinions to the Commune Party Committee and obtained their consent. On the 7th, they indeed completed the planting as scheduled, and the quality was particularly good. In other aspects such as technical measures and operational management, he would raise his differing opinions to the higher authorities at any time. Of course, when his opinion had not yet been answered by the higher authorities, he would unhesitatingly act in accordance with the decision of the higher authorities.
    Zhao Xianzhang's style of seeking truth from facts runs through all aspects like a red thread. He not only dares to put forward different opinions based on his own actual situation when performing tasks, but also truly achieves reporting the good as good and the bad as bad. The achievements in their brigade's work are great and numerous, but he does not ignore shortcomings because of achievements, and he never conceals even the smallest shortcomings. When planting sweet potatoes in 1958, the higher authorities put forward the requirement of deep plowing. More than two mu of land in the production team he led did not meet the deep plowing requirements. Later, when the higher authorities came to inspect, he truthfully reported it. Sometimes, when he finds that other comrades have made mistakes, he sternly corrects them. Last year, a comrade in their team made a mistake in the figures for deep plowing land. After he found out, he hurried to the Commune Party Committee to correct it.
    Listen to the Good as Good, the Bad as Bad
 Analyze Difficulties and Find Solutions

    Zhao Xianzhang treats lower-level cadres and the masses by listening to the good as good and the bad as bad. When he hears lower-level cadres report difficulties, he never scolds them, but helps them analyze the difficulties and find solutions. When the first team of the Zongzhai Production Team sowed wheat last winter, they were required to apply 30,000 jin of base fertilizer, but because the labor force of this team was transferred out and the source of fertilizer was lacking, it was estimated that they could only apply 20,000 jin. After Zhao Xianzhang found out, he helped them to specifically calculate the detailed accounts, dig for fertilizer sources, and arrange labor. When they had tried their best and only accumulated 25,000 jin of fertilizer, they proceeded with 25,000 jin of fertilizer. Zhao Xianzhang's spirit of seeking truth from facts deeply educated the cadres and masses of the Zongzhai Production Team. They never tell a lie to the higher authorities. As team leader Li Baoxin said: Secretary Zhao seeks truth from reality, and we report reality with reality.
    Zhao Xianzhang's meticulous and truth-seeking spirit is not only due to his possession of the excellent qualities of a Communist Party member who should be honest and truthful, but also his practical experience in leading production. He said: Farming cannot deceive people at all. If the leadership cannot obtain the real situation, they will not know where to exert their efforts. He used the fertilizer problem of the first team as an example, saying that if he reflected the difficulties to you, you scolded him, and did not honestly help him, he would not dare to tell the truth. But in the future, if the crops do not grow well, he would not dare to say that it is because of insufficient fertilizer. At this time, he knows it clearly in his heart, but the leadership is confused and does not know where the root cause of the poor crop growth lies, and there is no place to exert their efforts next year.
    Go Deep into the Masses and Take Root
 Success Can Be Achieved When Doing Things

    Zhao Xianzhang's spirit of seeking truth from facts is also inseparable from his style of going deep into the masses and following the mass line. He often said that one person's contact with things is limited after all, and the things they come up with will be relatively simple. Many people will come into contact with many things, and the things they come up with will be more in line with reality. Therefore, his style of seeking truth from facts has a deep mass base. In the Zongzhai Production Team, experienced old farmers are his old friends, and energetic and enthusiastic young men in their teens and twenties are his young friends. Whenever a task from the higher authorities comes or the team encounters any difficulties in their work, he will find his friends, discuss, study, and exchange opinions. In the exchange of opinions, he never lightly lets go of different opinions. When their commune began to promote Baimaya corn, the higher authorities had decided to plant 100 mu of it in their area. Old farmer Wang Shuren and others proposed that this corn had not been planted before, and they could not figure out what its temperament was. Could they plant less of it, experiment with it, and if it was successful, promote it next year? Zhao Xianzhang carefully analyzed the situation and believed that Wang Shuren's opinion was reasonable, so he put forward his opinion to the Township Party Committee. Later, the township agreed to let them only plant 50 mu. The old farmers saw that their opinions were adopted, and they were particularly active in production, spending all day in the fields trying to figure out the temperament of the Baimaya corn. In the autumn, the average yield per mu was more than 500 jin, which was two and a half times higher than the yield of ordinary corn in that year. The following year, they planted 360 mu all at once. When Zhao Xianzhang mentions this matter, he is still very emotional. He said: If you want to be able to seek truth from facts, there is no other magic weapon. Only when you have truly taken root among the masses and earnestly and humbly listen to their opinions can you be sure to seek truth from facts when you do things and speak.
    Zhao Xianzhang's style of seeking truth from facts is not contradictory to his spirit of daring to think, dare to speak, and dare to do. For things that can be accomplished through subjective effort, even if there are great difficulties, he will lead the masses and strive to do them well. When sowing wheat last year, more than 2,000 mu of land had to be deeply plowed, and tens of thousands of dan of base fertilizer had to be applied per mu. The task was heavy, the time was tight, and the labor force was lacking. At that time, Zhao Xianzhang analyzed the situation of the team and believed that as long as the masses were mobilized, the task could be completed on time. He took the lead and built a shed in the fields, eating, sleeping, and working in the fields for a whole month. When the masses saw him like this, they became even more enthusiastic and moved to the fields to live. In this way, after more than 30 days and nights of hard work and skillful work, their wheat sowing task was finally completed as scheduled.

### 实事求是　事事顺利  宗寨生产队党支书赵宪章出色地完成任务

    实事求是　事事顺利
    宗寨生产队党支书赵宪章出色地完成任务
    本报讯　记者缪宜琴报道：河南省长葛县和尚桥人民公社的党委会委员们，一提起他们公社的宗寨生产队，个个高兴地说：这个队的工作总是走在人家前面，生产任务完成得好，样样工作都很出色。
    宗寨生产队为什么能够出色地完成任务呢？是和这个队党支部书记赵宪章实事求是的优秀品质分不开的。有好报好有坏报坏
  不图虚名讲究实效
    赵宪章做任何工作，总是从自己的实际情况出发。凡是经过主观努力可以办到的事情，他一定努力办好，凡是经过主观努力办不到的事情，他总是根据实际情况提出不同意见。今年4月初，春播开始，和尚桥人民公社党委要求各个大队玉米播种任务在4月5日前完成。赵宪章分析了自己队里的实际情况：三百六十亩玉米地因为没有拖拉机，还没有全部犁完，积的肥料又特别多，要在4月5日前犁罢地，上好肥，播完种，那怕社员们不眠不休，也难办到。估计最快要到4月7日才能种完。当时，个别人怕“落在人家后面”，主张肥料少上点，4月5日前突击种完。赵宪章却不同意，他想，领导群众生产，一不要图虚名，二不要出风头，要讲究实效。肥料上不去，即使早种两天，玉米长不好，也是白搭。晚两天并不违农时，玉米可以长得更好。他一方面对个别人进行了说服教育，另方面向公社党委提出意见，取得了同意。7日，他们果然如期播种完毕，而且质量特别好。其他如技术措施、操作管理各方面，只要他对上级布置有不同意见，都随时提出来。当然，当他的意见还没有得到上级答复的时候，他就毫不犹疑地按照上级的决定办事。
    赵宪章这种实事求是的作风，像一根红线一样，贯串在各个方面。他既在执行任务的时候，从自己的实际情况出发，敢于提出不同意见，还真正做到了有好报好、有坏报坏。他们大队工作中的成绩很大、很多，但是，他并不因为成绩而忽视缺点，那怕是最微小的缺点，他也决不隐讳。1958年种白薯时，上级提出了深翻地的要求，他所领导的生产队有二亩多地没有达到深翻要求，后来，上级来检查时，他如实做了汇报。有时候，当他发现别的同志把事情弄错，他就严正地予以更正。去年，他们队有个同志把深翻地的数字弄错了，他知道后，连忙到公社党委去订正。
    有好听好有坏听坏  分析困难寻找办法
    赵宪章对待下面干部、群众则是有好听好，有坏听坏，当他听到下面干部反映困难时，他从来不训斥，而是帮助分析困难，寻找解决困难的办法。宗寨生产队第一小队在去冬种麦时，照要求要施底肥三万斤，但因这个小队劳力外调，肥源又缺乏，估计只能施二万斤。赵宪章知道后，就帮助他们具体算细账，挖肥源，安排劳力，当他们尽最大努力只积到二万五千斤肥料时，就照二万五千斤肥料办事。赵宪章这种实事求是的精神，深深教育着宗寨生产队的干部和群众，他们对上级也是从来不说一句假话，正如小组长李保新所说：赵支书以实求实，我们以实报实。
    赵宪章这种一丝不苟、实事求是的精神，固然由于他具备一个共产党员应有的老老实实的优秀品质，但也是他领导生产的实际经验。他说：种庄稼一点也不能骗人，领导上得不到真实情况，就不知道往哪儿使劲。他以第一小队肥料问题为例说，他向你反映困难，你训了他，不老老实实帮助他，他就不敢说真话。可将来庄稼长得不好，他也不敢说是肥料不足，这时，他心里雪亮，领导上却弄迷糊了，不知道庄稼长得不好的根歪在哪儿，下年有劲也没处使了。
    深入群众扎下根子  办起事来就能成功
    赵宪章的这种实事求是的精神还和他的深入群众、走群众路线的作风分不开。他常说，一个人接触到的事情毕竟有限，想出来的东西也就会比较简单，很多人就会接触很多事情，想出来的东西就更加符合实际。因此，他的实事求是的作风是有着深厚的群众基础的。在宗寨生产队，对生产有经验的老农是他的老朋友，一、二十岁的朝气蓬勃、干劲冲天的小伙子是他的年青朋友。每逢上级任务一来或者队里工作碰到什么困难，他就把他的朋友找来，商量，研究，交换意见。在交换意见当中，他对于不同意见，决不轻轻放过。当他们社开始推广白马牙玉米时，上级曾决定在他们那里种一百亩，老农王书任等提出，这玉米没种过，摸不着是啥脾气，是不是可以少种点，试验试验，能成，明年再推广。赵宪章仔细分析了情况，认为王书任的意见有道理，他就向乡党委提出了意见。后来，乡里同意他们只种五十亩。老农们看到自己的意见被采纳了，生产分外积极，一天到晚钻在地里摸那白马牙的脾气。秋后，平均亩产五百多斤，比当年一般玉米产量提高两倍半，第二年，他们就一下子种了三百六十亩。赵宪章在提起这件事来的时候，至今还是很感慨，他说：要能实事求是，没有别的法宝，只有当你在群众中真正扎下了根，并认真虚心听取他们意见的时候，你办起事来，说起话来，就一定是实事求是的。
    赵宪章这种实事求是的作风和他的敢想、敢说、敢做的精神并没有矛盾。凡是经过主观努力可以办到的事情，哪怕有天大的困难，他也要领导群众，努力办好。去年种麦子时，二千多亩地要深翻，每亩地要上底肥几万担，任务重，时间紧，劳力又缺乏。当时，赵宪章分析了队里的情况，认为只要把群众发动起来，一定能按时完成任务。他自己首先带头干，在田头搭了一个草棚，整整一个多月的时间，吃在田头，睡在田头，劳动在田头。群众见他这样，更加干劲冲天，都搬到田头住宿。就这样，经过三十多个日日夜夜的苦干、巧干，他们的麦子播种任务终于如期完成。
