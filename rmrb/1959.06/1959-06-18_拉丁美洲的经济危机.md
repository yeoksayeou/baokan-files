    The Economic Crisis in Latin America
    United States, Haiman Lamer
    The Impact of the American Economic Crisis
    The American economic crisis that began in 1957 has affected the rest of the capitalist world to varying degrees, particularly noticeably in countries that produce raw materials, with Latin American countries being the hardest hit. The economies of these countries are based on exporting one or more raw materials and using the foreign exchange earned to import large quantities of food, clothing, and manufactured goods that these countries need. Nearly 32% of Latin American products are used for foreign trade, most of which is conducted with the United States.
    American big businesses own nearly 80% of all foreign investment in Latin America, and Latin America accounts for 35% of all investments by American overseas companies. Most of Latin America's industries and resources are in American hands. For example, in Chile, the copper produced by Anaconda and Kennecott companies accounts for 92% of the total copper production. More than 75% of the proven oil resources in South America are controlled by American oil companies. Most of Latin America's mining, transportation, and power industries are controlled by the United States.
    American monopoly capital reaps huge profits through trade and investment, while the people of Latin America live in abject poverty. In 1958, the average income per person per year was only $212. In Peru, Haiti, Paraguay, Nicaragua, and Bolivia, the average income per person per year was less than $100. The highest—Venezuela—did not exceed $480.
    The price slump in the United States, which only began in 1957, brought severe economic difficulties to Latin American countries (except for Venezuela). In 1957, the export volume of these countries declined, after being stable for the previous five years. At the same time, the prices of exports also fell sharply. A 1957 United Nations economic survey of Latin America stated that from the first quarter to the fourth quarter of 1957, coffee prices fell by 8.7%, wheat by 7.2%, sugar by 35%, copper by 21%, tin by 8.7%, lead by 17%, and zinc by 25%.
    At the same time, the prices of imported manufactured goods continued to rise. According to the 1958 United Nations commodity survey report, from mid-1957 to mid-1958, while the export prices of raw materials fell by 10%, the prices of manufactured goods entering the world market increased by 1%. In some countries, trade conditions and import capacity deteriorated significantly. By the end of 1957, the total trade deficit of Latin American countries had reached nearly $600 million. This was the first time such a deficit had occurred since 1952. "The New York Times" acknowledged that 1958 was one of the worst years for the Latin American economy.
    Brazil is one of the countries that suffered the most. In the past few years, especially in 1957 and 1958, the Brazilian economy suffered a severe blow due to the increasingly serious overproduction of coffee and its declining price.
    In 1958, the deficit in balance of payments reached an unprecedented record, forcing drastic cuts in imports. The prices of imported goods soared. The large budget deficit was mostly caused by the government's practice of purchasing surplus coffee to prevent coffee prices from falling. At the end of 1958, government warehouses held 13 million bags of coffee. A good harvest of 25 million bags is expected in 1959, while the expected export volume is only 15 million bags. As a result, the value of the Cruzeiro (Brazilian currency) fell sharply, with the exchange rate against the dollar falling from 69 to 1 in mid-1957 to 152 to 1 in January 1959. The cost of living continued to rise, officially estimated to have risen by about 30% in 1958 alone.
    Argentina, caught between falling raw material prices and rising prices of imported manufactured goods, also suffered from the disastrous effects of inflation. Since 1954, Argentina's total trade deficit has reached $1 billion, and its gold reserves have fallen from about $500 million to a dangerously low level of less than $100 million. The peso continued to depreciate, with the official exchange rate against the dollar falling from 18 to 1 in 1955 to 77 to 1 at the end of 1958. In 1958 alone, the cost of living index rose by 45%, and it is continuing to rise at an unprecedented rate in 1959.
    Difficulties in Developing Domestic Industries
    One important reason why the situation is so serious is that these countries have encountered difficulties in their efforts to develop diversified domestic industries. The pressure to achieve industrialization (led by the national bourgeoisie) has existed for many years, but it has been particularly strong since the end of World War II. Moreover, it has gone beyond the scope of developing light industry and focused specifically on two basic products—steel and oil—to make these two products self-sufficient. In addition, due to the need for large amounts of capital, the pressure for state investment has been increasing.
    In some Latin American countries, industrial development has made great progress and has had a significant impact on society and politics. However, because this development relies on importing necessary capital goods from abroad and is met with strong resistance from the United States and other monopoly capital, development remains very limited. In particular, efforts to develop state-owned steel and oil industries have made even less progress.
    American monopoly capital and the State Department particularly dislike state-owned enterprises. They claim to oppose these enterprises "in principle" and are firmly opposed to giving these enterprises loans or assistance. For example, last August, Secretary of State Dulles rejected Brazil's request for a loan to develop oil, on the grounds that money could not be spent on such "speculative" investments. He told the Brazilians that the necessary funds should be obtained from American oil companies.
    Faced with this attitude, Latin American countries have had to exhaust their foreign exchange reserves and purchase equipment from the United States at excessive prices and unfavorable terms. In addition, they can generally only partially meet their needs and therefore have to rely heavily on imports of oil and, to varying degrees, imports of steel.
    In Brazil, the state-owned oil company Petrobras only supplies 20% of the country's needs. Last year, total oil imports reached $270 million—mainly responsible for Brazil's balance of payments deficit. Argentina produced about 100,000 barrels of oil per day in January 1959, while its daily oil consumption was 250,000 barrels, costing $300 million annually to import oil. Argentina also imports nearly $200 million worth of steel annually.
    A large part of the trade deficit and budget deficit is due to spending large sums of money on importing oil, steel, and other equipment. At the same time, this has greatly accelerated inflation and seriously deepened the economic crisis.
    Onerous Loan Conditions
    Seeing the constant requests for assistance from Latin American countries, the Eisenhower administration pursued a policy of taking advantage of their plight to advance the interests of American monopoly capital.
    As a condition for loans, the United States forced Latin American countries to devalue their currencies and make local currencies freely convertible, as this would facilitate the repatriation of profits by American companies, but would further accelerate the depletion of these countries' foreign exchange reserves. It insisted that these countries adopt "austerity" plans, supposedly in an attempt to control inflation by suppressing the wages and living standards of the working people. It demanded that these countries abandon plans to develop oil and other industries and transfer these industries to foreign capital.
    Argentine President Frondizi accepted a "stabilization" plan last December as a condition for obtaining a $329 million loan from the United States. This is the most obvious example of this policy being put into practice. To obtain this loan, Frondizi agreed to the following: 1. Devaluation of the peso and abolition of all exchange restrictions. 2. Elimination of all import restrictions. 3. Elimination of price subsidies for consumers and suppression of wage increases. 4. Elimination of deficits in state-owned enterprises by transferring them or seeking assistance from foreign capital.
    Juan de Onis wrote in "The New York Times" on January 14, 1959: If the stabilization plan can support President Frondizi's development plan, then American investors and capital goods exporters to Argentina will have a bright future. But for the Argentine people, this agreement will only cause prices to rise further. By March, utility costs had risen by 200%, electricity bills by 150%, and gasoline by 200%. Due to price increases, meat consumption decreased by 50%.
    In addition, President Eisenhower's decision last September to cut lead and zinc import quotas by one-third is another illustration of American policy. This step ostensibly protects an industry in this country that employs a total of 3,500 workers, but it has had a serious impact on Peru, where 12,000 workers have been deprived of their jobs, and has also severely affected Mexico (which has about 50,000 lead and zinc miners) and Bolivia. The people's resentment of American aggressive policies
    It is perfectly understandable that an increasing number of people in Latin American countries believe that American imperialism is responsible for their plight and are increasingly resentful of American policies and the rulers in their own countries who help to impose these policies on the people.
    Latin Americans hate the United States for supporting universally condemned dictators. They are all too aware of the role the State Department has played in Guatemala and other countries.
    It is not surprising that this anger erupted during Nixon's visit to Latin America last year, and he received such a reception. Today, the peoples of Latin American countries are moving towards complete national freedom. In May 1957, the Rojas Pinilla tyranny in Colombia was overthrown, followed by the overthrow of Jiménez in Venezuela in January 1958, and then the inspiring victory of the Cuban people who defeated the bloody dictator Batista. The current crisis is further promoting the national liberation movement.
    Under the pressure of the economic crisis and the rising sentiment against American imperialism, trade between Latin American countries and socialist countries, especially the Soviet Union, has further developed. In 1958, the Soviet Union replaced Britain as the largest employer of Uruguayan wool, purchasing nearly 30% of Uruguay's total wool exports. Uruguay, in turn, purchased 1.25 million barrels of oil from the Soviet Union, relying on the Soviet Union as its main supplier. In addition, Uruguay also imported Soviet cotton, newspapers from the German Democratic Republic, electrical equipment from Hungary, and various manufactured goods from Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, and Poland.
    Argentina's trade has also greatly developed. In early 1958, the Soviet Union provided a $100 million line of credit for Argentina to purchase oil equipment, and more than one-third of the funds have already been used. Argentina has also purchased Soviet oil, locomotives, and rails, purchased a complete set of coal washing equipment from Czechoslovakia, and reached an agreement with Poland to purchase 2 million tons of coal from Poland over the next four years.
    In October 1958, Brazil reached its first trade agreement with the Soviet Union since 1947, exchanging 20,000 bags of cocoa powder for 60,000 tons of oil. The Soviet Union also expressed its willingness to exchange oil for coffee and cotton, and expressed its willingness to provide Brazil with all the oil equipment it needs. Poland and Czechoslovakia offered to provide it with ships and oil.
    Chile sold 15,000 tons of copper to the Soviet Union in March 1958. However, this planned trade was later stopped by the United States, which threatened to impose tariffs on the grounds that inter-American agreements prohibited such trade.
    Currently, the volume of this trade is still small—less than 2% of Latin America's total trade. But since 1952, the trade volume has grown by about 40% annually.
    The growth rate of this trade could very well be much faster, as it can truly help Latin American countries achieve economic independence and development.

    拉丁美洲的经济危机
    美国　海曼·拉默
    美国经济危机的影响
    1957年开始的美国经济危机在不同程度上影响了资本主义世界的其余地区，特别明显的是它对原料生产国的影响，其中受害最深的是拉丁美洲国家。这些国家的经济的基础是出口一种或一种以上的原料，并用从中取得的外汇来进口这些国家需要的大量食物、衣着和制成品。在拉丁美洲的产品中，将近32％用来进行对外贸易，其中大部分用来同美国进行贸易。
    美国的大企业拥有拉丁美洲全部外国投资的将近80％，拉丁美洲占去美国海外公司全部投资的35％。拉丁美洲的工业和资源多半掌握在美国人手中。譬如，在智利，安那康达和肯奈柯特两家采铜公司所生产的铜占全部铜产量的92％。在南美已查明的石油资源中，75％以上是由美国石油公司控制的。拉丁美洲的矿业、交通运输业和动力工业大部分控制在美国手里。
    美国垄断资本通过贸易和投资捞取大量利润，而拉丁美洲人民则生活在赤贫之中。1958年，每人每年的平均收入只有二百一十二美元。在秘鲁、海地、巴拉圭、尼加拉瓜和玻利维亚，每人每年的平均收入还不到一百美元。最高的——委内瑞拉——也不超过四百八十美元。
    1957年美国物价暴跌才开始，就给拉丁美洲国家带来严重的经济困难（委内瑞拉除外）。1957年，这些国家的出口量下降了，而在这以前的五年中，出口量一直是稳定的。同时，出口品价格也大大下降。1957年联合国对拉丁美洲的经济调查报告说，从1957年的第一季度到第四季度，咖啡价格下跌8.7％，小麦7.2％，糖35％，铜21％，锡8.7％，铅17％，锌25％。
    同时，进口的制成品的价格继续上升。据1958年的联合国商品调查报告，从1957年年中到1958年年中，在原料出口价格下跌10％的同时，进入世界市场的制成品的价格却增加了1％。在一些国家里，贸易条件和进口能力大大恶化。到1957年底，拉丁美洲国家的贸易逆差总数达到了将近六亿美元。1952年以来，这种逆差还是第一次。“纽约时报”承认，1958年是拉丁美洲经济最糟糕的年头中的一年。
    巴西是受害最深的国家之一。在过去几年来，尤其在1957年和1958年，由于咖啡生产过剩的情况日益严重和它的价格日益下降，因而巴西的经济遭到了严重的打击。
    1958年，在支付平衡方面的亏空数达到了空前的纪录，因此不得不大量削减进口。进口货的价格就飞涨了起来。大笔预算亏空多半是由于政府用购买剩余咖啡来制止咖啡价格下跌的做法而引起的。1958年底，在政府的仓库中存有一千三百万袋咖啡。预料1959年将有二千五百万袋的好收成，而预料的出口数只有一千五百万袋。结果，克鲁赛罗（巴西货币）的价值大大下降了，它和美元的兑换率从1957年年中的六十九比一跌到了1959年1月的一百五十二比一。生活费用不断上涨，据官方估计，仅仅在1958年一年，就上涨了30％左右。
    遭到原料跌价和进口的制成品加价两路夹攻的阿根廷，也同样受到通货膨胀的灾难性的影响。从1954年以来，阿根廷贸易逆差的总数达到十亿美元，它的黄金储备从约五亿美元跌至不到一亿美元这种低得危险的水平。比索不断贬值，它同美元的官方比价从1955年的十八比一跌到了1958年底的七十七比一。在1958年一年中，生活费用的指数上升了45％，而且在1959年正在继续以空前的速度上升。
    发展本国工业遭到困难
    情况所以如此严重，一个重要原因是，这些国家在发展多种本国工业方面所作的努力遇到了困难。要求实现工业化（以民族资产阶级为先锋）的压力存在已有多年了，只是在第二次世界大战结束以后压力才特别大起来。而且，它已超越了发展轻工业的范围，而特别集中在两种基本产品——钢和石油——上，以使这两种产品能够自给自足。另外，由于需要大量资本，因此要求国家投资的压力便越来越大了。
    在一些拉丁美洲国家里，工业的发展取得了很大的进展，并且在社会和政治方面产生了重大影响。然而，由于这种发展有赖于从外国进口必需的资本货，同时又遭到美国和其他垄断资本的坚决反抗，因此发展仍然非常有限。尤其在发展国营炼钢工业和石油工业方面的努力进展得更少。
  美国垄断资本和国务院特别讨厌国营企业。它们声称在“原则上”反对这些企业，而且他们坚决不给这些企业以贷款或援助。例如，在去年8月，国务卿杜勒斯拒绝了巴西希望得到一笔开发石油的贷款的要求，理由是不能花钱进行这种“投机性的”投资。他对巴西人说，必要的资金应该从美国石油公司那里取得。
    面对这种态度，拉丁美洲国家不得不用尽外汇并以过高的价格和不利的条件向美国购买装备。除此之外，它们一般只能部分地满足自己的需要，因此不得不大大依靠石油的进口，以及在不同的程度上，依靠钢的进口。
    在巴西，国营石油企业巴西石油公司只供应国家需要的20％。去年石油进口总数达二亿七千万美元——巴西支付逆差主要是它造成的。阿根廷在1959年1月日产石油十万桶左右，每日消耗的石油量为二十五万桶，每年要花掉三亿美元来进口石油。阿根廷每年还进口价值将近二亿美元的钢铁。
    贸易逆差和预算赤字有很大一部分是由于把大笔金钱用来进口石油、钢和其他装备所造成的。同时这大大地加快了通货膨胀，严重地加深了经济危机。
    苛刻的贷款条件
    看到拉丁美洲国家不断提出希望得到帮助的要求，艾森豪威尔政府奉行了一种乘人以危来增进美国垄断资本利益的政策。
    作为贷款的一个条件，美国迫使拉丁美洲国家贬低币值，使当地货币可以自由兑换，因为这便于美国公司抽回利润，但是这却更进一步加速了这些国家外汇储备的枯竭。它坚持要这些国家采取“节约”计划，据说是企图用压低劳动人民的工资和生活水平的办法来控制通货膨胀。它要求这些国家放弃发展石油和其他工业的计划，而把这种工业移交给外国资本。
    阿根廷总统弗朗迪西于去年12月接受了“稳定”计划，作为取得美国三亿二千九百万美元贷款的条件。这便是这种政策付诸实施的最明显的例子。为了得到这笔贷款，弗朗迪西同意了下列各点：一、比索贬值和取消一切兑换限制。二、取消一切进口限制。三、取消给消费者的价格补贴和压制工资的提高。四、用出让或向外国资本谋求帮助的办法来消除国营企业的亏空。
    胡安·德奥尼斯在1959年1月14日的“纽约时报”上写道：如果稳定计划能够支持得住弗朗迪西总统的发展计划，那么美国向阿根廷的投资者和资本货输出者都会有一段光明的前景。但是对阿根廷人民来说，这一协定只会使物价进一步飞涨。到3月份，公用事业费用上涨了200％，电费上涨了150％，汽油上涨了200％。由于价格上涨，肉类消耗减少了50％。
    另外，艾森豪威尔总统于去年9月决定把铅和锌的进口限额削减三分之一的行动，是美国政策的另一说明。这一步骤表面上是保护这个国家中总共雇佣了三千五百名工人的工业，但是它对秘鲁产生了严重的影响，因为那里有一万二千名工人被剥夺了工作，同时还严重地影响了墨西哥（它有五万名左右的铅矿和锌矿工人）和玻利维亚。人民对美国侵略政策的愤慨
    拉丁美洲国家中越来越多的人都认为美帝国主义必须对他们所处的困境负责，他们越来越讨厌美国的政策和他们自己国家中帮助把这种政策潜加在人民头上的统治者，是完全可以理解的。
    拉丁美洲人讨厌美国支持万夫所指的独裁者。他们对于国务院在危地马拉和其他国家中所扮演的角色了解得太透彻了。
    在去年尼克松访问拉丁美洲时这种愤怒爆发出来了，他遭到这种接待是不足为奇的。今天，拉丁美洲各国人民正在向彻底的民族自由迈进。1957年5月，哥伦比亚的罗哈斯·皮尼亚暴政被推翻了，随后，在1958年1月，委内瑞拉的希门尼斯也被推翻了，接着，古巴人民打败了血腥的独裁者巴蒂斯塔而取得了鼓舞人心的胜利。目前的危机正在进一步推动民族解放运动。
    在经济危机的压力和反抗美帝国主义的情绪日益高涨的情况下，拉丁美洲国家同社会主义国家，尤其同苏联的贸易有了进一步的发展。在1958年，苏联取代英国，成了乌拉圭羊毛的最大雇主，购买了乌拉圭羊毛总出口量的将近30％。而乌拉圭则向苏联购买一百二十五万桶石油，依靠苏联作为自己的主要供应国。此外，乌拉圭还进口苏联的棉花、德意志民主共和国的报纸、匈牙利的电气器材、捷克斯洛伐克、德意志民主共和国和波兰的各种制成品。
    阿根廷的贸易也大有发展。1958年初，苏联提供了一笔一亿美元的信贷，让阿根廷购买石油设备，而且已经用了三分之一以上的款子，阿根廷还购买了苏联的石油、火车头和铁轨，购买了捷克斯洛伐克的一整套洗煤设备，而且还同波兰达成协议，在今后四年内向波兰购买二百万吨煤。
    1958年10月，巴西同苏联达成了1947年以来的第一个贸易协定，以二万袋可可粉交换六万吨石油。苏联还表示愿意用石油来交换咖啡和棉花，表示愿意向巴西提供它所必需的一切石油设备。波兰和捷克斯洛伐克向它提供船只和石油。
    智利于1958年3月向苏联销售了一万五千吨铜。然而这项计划中的贸易后来为美国所制止，它扬言要强加关税，理由是因为美洲国家间的协定禁止这种贸易。
    目前这种贸易量还是很小——不到拉丁美洲总贸易量的2％。但是自从1952年以来，贸易量每年大约增长40％。
    这种贸易的增长速度完全可能比这快得多，因为它可以真正帮助拉丁美洲国家实现经济独立和发展。
