This dispatch from Lanzhou on the 23rd reports that Yuzhong County, Gansu Province, has implemented a livestock archive management system with significant results. Livestock have transitioned from weak to strong, becoming plump and healthy, and their breeding rate has increased. Even during the past winter and spring when grass was scarce, 86.5% of the county's livestock maintained a first or second-class condition. 97% of the eligible female animals were bred. The county has essentially achieved the goal of being free from livestock epidemics, preventing the ten most harmful livestock diseases, such as anthrax, rinderpest, and foot-and-mouth disease.

In recent years, due to the lack of dedicated personnel responsible for livestock feeding, husbandry, and breeding, the phenomena of livestock losing condition, becoming weak, falling ill, and dying were widespread. At the same time, due to poor feeding and unreasonable husbandry, livestock did not easily go into heat, and female animals were prone to abortion, resulting in a very low breeding rate. This situation was increasingly unable to meet the demand for animal power for the great development of agricultural production.

In order to reverse this situation and strive to have more and stronger livestock participate in busy farm work, Yuzhong County implemented a livestock archive management system, establishing an archive for each animal, recording the animal's feeding, husbandry, breeding situation, and the name of the person in charge. For example, in terms of feeding, the archive records the animal's food intake, preferences, etc.; in terms of husbandry, the archive records the animal's physical characteristics, working capacity, etc.; in terms of breeding, the archive records pregnancy, abortion, and birthing situations, etc. The archive also stipulates fixed feeders (who also manage breeding work) and fixed herders who are fully responsible for the livestock they feed, breed, and herd. Those who perform excellently are rewarded, while those who do poorly are criticized and disciplined. After the Pengjiaying Production Brigade of Chengguan Commune established a livestock archive management system, it fed and herded livestock separately based on the specific conditions of each animal's physical strength. Now, all the livestock in the brigade are plump and strong, pregnant animals are protected, and young animals are kept alive.

The implementation of the livestock archive management system in Yuzhong County has many benefits. First, it enables feeders and herders to work together to protect and develop livestock. There is a handover system between feeders and herders. In terms of herding, reasonable herding has also been achieved. The phenomenon of hitting livestock with wooden sticks in the past has been greatly reduced, and pregnant animals are not overworked. Second, the archive can help feeders reasonably manage each animal and pay attention to breeding in a timely manner. Third, leading departments can promptly identify and resolve problems based on the information recorded in the archive, such as arranging for timely breeding for strong animals and allocating farm work according to the livestock's condition.

### 实行档案管理　专责饲养使役  榆中牲畜膘肥体壮

    实行档案管理　专责饲养使役
    榆中牲畜膘肥体壮
    本报兰州23日电甘　肃省榆中县实行牲畜档案管理制度，收到了显著效果，牲畜由弱转强，膘肥体壮，繁殖率增高。就在去冬今春草比较少的情况下，全县86.5％的牲畜保持了一、二等膘。97％的适龄母畜都配了种。全县已经基本上达到了无畜疫的要求，防止了危害牲畜最严重的炭疽、牛瘟、口蹄疫等十种疫病。
    几年来，由于无专人负责牲畜的饲养、使役和繁殖工作，牲畜掉膘、乏弱、患病和死亡的现象普遍发生；同时由于饲养不好和使役不合理，牲畜不易发情，母畜容易流产，繁殖率很低。这种情况越来越不能适应农业生产大发展对畜力的需求。
    为了扭转这种情况，争取有又多又壮的牲畜参加繁忙的农活，榆中县实行了牲畜档案管理制度，为每一头牲畜建立了档案，记载牲畜的饲养、使役、繁殖情况和负责人姓名。如饲养方面，记载牲畜食量、喜好等；使役方面，记载牲畜体形特征、使役能力等；繁殖方面，记载怀胎、流产、生产情况等。档案上还规定固定饲养员（兼管繁殖工作）和固定使役员，应对自己饲养、繁殖和使役的牲畜负完全责任。成绩优秀者给奖，反之要给以批评和处分。城关公社彭家营生产大队建立牲畜档案管理制度后，根据每头牲畜的体力等具体情况，分别饲养和使役。现在全大队的牲畜头头膘肥体壮，孕畜保胎，幼畜保活。
    榆中县实行牲畜档案管理制度好处很多。首先，使饲养员和使役员共同为保护牲畜和发展牲畜努力。饲养员和使役员之间有交接制度。在使役方面，也做到了合理使役，过去用木棒打牲畜的现象大大减少了，孕畜也不过重使用。其次，档案可以帮助饲养员合理地管理每一头牲畜，并适时注意繁殖。第三，领导部门可以根据档案记载及时发现问题和解决问题。例如及时为壮畜配种，按照牲畜情况调配农活。
