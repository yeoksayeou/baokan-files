    This newspaper reports that the CPC Chuxian County Committee in Anhui Province convened a symposium attended by county, commune, brigade, and production team cadres, as well as some commune members, to earnestly discuss how to improve production team leadership. It was decided to train and cultivate production team leaders by commune.
    Chuxian County currently has 964 production teams and more than 3,500 team leaders and deputy team leaders. Most of the team leaders have good class backgrounds, work hard, and have production and leadership experience. However, some cadres, although hardworking, have not done a good job in production due to a lack of leadership ability. In order to quickly change this situation, the County Committee held a symposium in Zhulong and Machang Communes on how to improve production team leadership. After discussion, everyone agreed that to be a good production team leader, it is first necessary to establish and improve the team committee. Some elderly, young, and middle-aged commune members with rich production experience and activists should be elected to participate, which will strengthen collective leadership and make the team committee more representative. This has five advantages: more ears, more eyes, more mouths, more legs, and more ideas. More ears mean listening more, preventing subjective and one-sided actions; more eyes mean seeing more and discovering problems quickly; more mouths mean more publicity and better ideological education; more legs mean running around more and being able to solve problems in a timely manner; and more ideas mean things can be done well. At the same time, the establishment of the team committee allows the team leader to have more time to participate in production, consider problems, and closely contact the masses, overcoming various problems such as coercion, commandism, paternalism, and authoritarianism.
    In discussing the mass line, everyone believed that to be a good production team leader, one must calculate, listen twice, agree twice, observe three times, be straightforward in three ways, be diligent in four ways, and take the lead in three ways. Calculating means that the team leader must be able to calculate and have everything in mind. One must learn to calculate three accounts: one is the production plan account: calculate stubble, calculate targets, calculate measures; one is the income and expenditure account: how much grain, oil, cotton, and diversified economic income are there, how much is spent, and how much income do commune members have; one is the labor account: how to carefully plan and properly arrange to improve attendance and labor efficiency. Listening twice means listening to both the superiors and the masses, and unifying the words of the superiors and the masses. Correct opinions among the masses should be adopted, and incorrect opinions should be patiently persuaded. Agreeing twice means eating and working together. The team leader eats the same food as the commune members, works the same way, and does not take advantage. Observing three times means observing whether the crops are growing well, whether the mood of the commune members is high or low, and whether the climate is changing. Being straightforward in three ways means being honest, speaking frankly, and being upright in handling affairs. Being diligent in four ways means being diligent with eyes, mind, mouth, and legs. Think of more ideas, run around diligently, and often look, ask, and talk, not afraid of trouble. Taking the lead in three ways means taking the lead in work, taking the lead in enduring hardship, and taking the lead in difficult tasks.
    In terms of leadership methods, everyone believed that competition, inspection, and comparison are good methods. Competition is a red flag competition. Every important production movement must have competition. There must be competition between communes, teams, commune members, and cadres, and there must be mutual help from beginning to end. Inspection means inspection and acceptance. There must be daily meetings and daily inspections to discover and solve problems in a timely manner. Comparison means evaluating advanced individuals.
    In terms of management methods, everyone believed that it is necessary to establish a set of management systems. The methods that have been effective in the past should be summarized, improved, and applied flexibly. For example, there must be long-term plans and short-term arrangements, and detailed arrangements must be made for three or five days to ensure that people, fields, and time are determined. After the plan is arranged, it should be submitted to the commune members for discussion so that the commune members can know everything three days in advance.
    After holding this symposium, the County Committee, through full discussion, has decided to issue this opinion to cadres at all levels throughout the county for further research and promotion. At the same time, it plans to fully improve the leadership level of production team leaders through production, setting up pacesetters, using the strong to lead the weak, on-site visits, typical introductions, inspections, comparisons, and strengthening leadership.

    Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, July 7th. Since May, Changshi Management District of Changshi Commune in Dafang County, Guizhou Province, has implemented the "Three Things a Day for Everyone to Know" method, which has rapidly improved labor efficiency and made production management well-organized.
    The content of "Three Things a Day for Everyone to Know" includes: (1) Each commune member knows the minimum amount of agricultural work they must complete; (2) Knows the quality requirements for doing this agricultural work; (3) Knows how many work points they will get after completing the task according to quantity, quality, and on time, and how many work points they will get for exceeding the quota. The specific method is that the production team hands over the agricultural work for five to ten days and the corresponding work points to each work group. The work group then contracts it to several people or one person according to the distance, size, type, and weight of the field. Each commune member arranges their work according to the contracted task, so that they "know three things a day."
    After the Changshi Management District implemented this method in May, the principle of "to each according to his work" was better implemented, and the enthusiasm of commune members for labor was greatly improved. This changed the phenomenon of waiting for the group leader to arrange agricultural work every day, and they can generally consciously complete their tasks. At the same time, production management is more orderly, the work of the production team leader is more organized, and the trouble of evaluating work and recording points every day is reduced.
    This method is particularly suitable for mountainous areas where agricultural work is scattered, and can avoid the phenomenon of commune members running back and forth to waste work in the arrangement of work.

    安徽滁全县讨论怎样当好生产队长
    贵州大方县长石公社推行社员“一天三知道”
    本报讯　中共安徽滁全县县委召开县、公社、大队、生产队干部和有部分社员参加的座谈会，认真讨论了怎样改进生产队领导问题，并决定以公社为单位，训练和培养生产队长。
    滁全县现有九百六十四个生产队，三千五百多个正副队长。大部分队长都是成份好，积极苦干，有生产经验和领导经验。但是也有一些干部虽然积极苦干，由于缺乏领导能力，没有搞好生产。县委为了迅速改变这种情况，在珠龙、马厂两个公社召开了怎样改进生产队领导方法的座谈会。经大家讨论，认为当好生产队长首先要建立和健全队委会。应该选举一些生产经验丰富的老年、青年、壮年社员和积极分子参加，这样既加强了集体领导，又使队委会成员更具有代表性。它的好处有五多：耳多、眼多、嘴多、腿多、点子多。耳多就听得多，防止办事主观片面；眼多就看得多，发现问题快；嘴多就宣传得多，思想教育好；腿多就跑得多，能及时解决问题；点子多事情就能办好。同时建立了队委会使队长有更多的时间参加生产，考虑问题，又能密切联系群众，克服强迫命令、包办代替和独断专行的各种毛病。
    在讨论群众路线问题上，大家认为当好生产队长要做到一算、二听、二同、三看、三直、四勤、三带头。一算是当队长要会计算，事事做到心中有数。要学会算三笔账，一笔是生产计划账：算茬口，算指标，算措施；一笔是收入支出账：粮、油、棉和多种经济收入各多少，开支多少，社员收入多少；一笔是劳动力账：怎样精打细算妥善安排，提高出勤率和劳动效率。二听是既要听上级的话，又要听群众的话，把上级和群众的话统一起来，对群众中正确的意见要采纳，不正确的要耐心说服。二同是同吃同劳动。队长和社员吃一样的饭，一样干活，不占便宜。三看是看庄稼生长好坏，看社员情绪高低，看气候是否变化。三直是心直、嘴直、办事正直。四勤是眼勤、脑勤、嘴勤、腿勤。多想点子，勤跑跑，常看看、问问、讲讲，不怕烦神。三带头是干活带头，吃苦带头，难事带头。
    在领导方法上，大家认为赛、查、比是个好方法。赛是红旗竞赛，每一个重要的生产运动都要赛。社与社，队与队，社员与社员，干部对干部都要赛，并且要有始有终互相帮助。查就是检查验收，要天天碰头，日日检查，及时发现和解决问题。比就是评比先进。
    在管理方法上大家认为需要建立一套管理制度，过去行之有效的方法要加以总结提高，灵活运用。例如必须长计划短安排，三天或五天要细致安排，做到定人，定田，定时。计划安排好以后，要交给社员讨论，使社员做到三天早知道。
    县委在召开了这个座谈会后，又通过充分讨论，已决定把这个意见发给全县各级干部进一步研究推广，同时计划通过生产，树立标兵，以强带弱，现场参观，典型介绍，检查评比，加强领导等办法全面提高生产队长的领导水平。　（楼纪和）
    本报贵阳7日电　贵州省大方县长石公社长石管理区，从5月份开始推行“每人一天三知道”的工作方法后，劳动效率迅速提高，生产管理井井有条。
    “每人一天三知道”的内容包括：（1）每个社员知道自己必须完成的最低农活数量；
  （2）知道做这项农活的质量要求；（3）知道自己在按量按质按时完成任务后得到多少工分，超额多少得多少工分。具体作法是，生产队把五天至十天的农活和应得工分交给各作业组。作业组再根据田地远近大小，活路种类、轻重等，分别包给几个人或一个人。每个社员即按照承包任务，安排自己的工作，作到“一天三知道”。
    长石管理区5月份实行这个办法后，使按劳付酬原则得到更好的贯彻，社员劳动积极性大为提高，改变了每天等组长安排农活的现象，一般都能自觉完成自己的任务。同时生产管理也更加有秩序了，生产队长的工作更加有条理了，每天评工记分的麻烦也减少了。
    这个方法特别适用于农活分散的山区，可以避免安排活路当中社员跑来跑去浪费工的现象。
