Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 27th - According to TASS: The damming project of the Angara River for the world's largest Bratsk Hydroelectric Station officially began on the 23rd.

	The damming project of this longest river in Siberia will be carried out in two stages. First, a stone embankment will be built from the left bank of the river with stones within twenty-four days, and then the 119-meter-wide gap will be blocked head-on with a bridge.

	The damming of the Angara River will use diabase blocks because their strength is no less than iron, and their weight greatly exceeds concrete blocks. The Angara River's current is extremely rapid, and ordinary ten-ton concrete blocks are easily washed away by the water like matchboxes. Since the steep banks of the Angara River are composed of diabase, it is twice as cheap to use this type of rock to dam the river than to use concrete blocks.

    世界最大水电站加速施工
    安加拉河拦河工程开始
    新华社莫斯科27日电　据塔斯社讯：世界最大的布拉次克水电站安加拉河的拦河工程已于23日正式开始。
    这条西伯利亚最长的河流的拦河工程将分为两个阶段进行。首先，将在二十四天内从河的左岸用石块筑成一条石堤，然后将宽达一百一十九公尺的缺口用桥梁迎面拦断。
    安加拉河的拦河工程将采用辉绿岩块，因为它的坚固性不亚于铁，而重量大大超过混凝土块。安加拉河水流异常湍急，普通十吨重的混凝土块就像火柴盒一样很容易地被水冲走。由于安加拉河的陡峭的河岸都是辉绿岩构成的，所以用这种岩块拦河要比用混凝土块便宜一倍。
