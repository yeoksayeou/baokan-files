Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 14th: Jilin Province, one of China's major soybean producing areas, has overfulfilled its soybean and oil crop sowing plan. According to preliminary statistics, the province has sown more than 13,420,000 mu of soybeans, exceeding the original plan by 380,000 mu; and 2,100,000 mu of oil crops such as sunflowers and sesame, exceeding the plan by 600,000 mu. Currently, various regions are taking advantage of scattered plots of land to continue planting soybeans and oil crops.

This year, the quality of soybean sowing in Jilin Province has significantly improved compared to previous years, generally meeting requirements such as prioritized sowing, meticulous land preparation, careful selection of improved varieties, and rational close planting. Now, soybean seedlings are generally growing vigorously, and early-sown soybeans are already lush green.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 14th: People's communes in Shandong are seizing the favorable opportunity after rain to rush-plant oil crops, striving to expand the planting area of summer-sown oil crops. Currently, the province has sown more than 350,900 mu of late-season sesame.

To compensate for the insufficient peanut planting in the spring, Party committees at all levels in Shandong have conscientiously implemented the Provincial Party Committee's instructions on increasing the planting of oil crops. The Jimo County Party Committee decided to expand the sesame planting area from 20,000 mu to 100,000 mu, and the county planted more than 7,800 mu of sesame in three days. People's communes in the Jinan, Liaocheng, and Yantai regions have also, based on their experience in previous years, adopted intercropping methods of sesame with sweet potatoes, mung beans, peanuts and other short-stalk crops to expand the planting area. By June 10, the three regions had planted more than 230,100 mu of sesame. When sowing sesame and soybeans, various regions also promoted yield-increasing measures such as rational close planting.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 13th: Farmers in oil crop areas of Hubei Province are currently vigorously rush-planting autumn oil crops.

In order to plant autumn oil crops well, various regions in Hubei Province, before sowing, some areas have planned peanuts, sesame, etc. according to the principle of adapting to local conditions, and have taken various measures to expand the planting area of these crops. For example, Luotian County originally planned to plant 10,000 mu of sesame, but later expanded to more than 15,000 mu after mobilizing the masses for discussion. Now, more than 9,800 mu have been sown, and rush-planting is continuing. Guanghua County has already overfulfilled this year's sesame sowing plan. Xiangyang County, known nationally for its high sesame yield, has seen rapid and effective sowing work due to the importance attached by Party committees at all levels. The county has sown more than 290,000 mu, accounting for about 90% of the planned area.

    吉林播种大豆超过计划
    山东湖北农民增种芝麻花生
    据新华社长春14日电　我国大豆主要产区之一吉林省超额完成了大豆和油料作物播种计划。据初步统计，全省已播种大豆一千三百四十二万多亩，超过原计划三十八万亩；播种向日葵、芝麻等油料作物二百一十万亩，超过计划六十万亩。目前，各地正利用零星土地，继续抢种大豆和油料作物。
    吉林省今年大豆播种质量比往年有显著提高，普遍达到了优先播种、细致整地、精选良种、合理密植等要求。现在，大豆幼苗普遍生育肥壮，早播的大豆已一片嫩绿。
    据新华社济南14日电　山东各地人民公社正在抓紧雨后良机，抢种油料作物，力争扩大夏播油料作物的种植面积。现在全省已播种晚茬芝麻三十五万零九百多亩。
    为了弥补春播花生种植较少的不足，山东各级党委都认真贯彻执行了省委增种油料作物的指示。即墨县委决定把种植芝麻的面积由二万亩扩大到十万亩，全县在三天内就播种芝麻七千八百多亩。济宁、聊城、烟台专区的人民公社，也都根据往年的经验，采取芝麻同地瓜、绿豆、花生等矮秆作物间作办法，扩大种植面积，到6月10日、三个专区已种植芝麻二十三万零一百多亩。在播种芝麻、大豆时，各地还推广了合理密植等增产措施。
    据新华社武汉13日电　湖北省油料作物地区的农民，目前正大力抢种秋季油料作物。
    湖北省各地为了把秋季油料作物种好，在播种前，有的地区根据因地制宜的原则，对花生、芝麻等都作了规划，并且采取各种措施扩大这些作物的播种面积。例如，罗田县原先规划播种芝麻一万亩，后来通过发动群众讨论，结果扩大到一万五千多亩。现在已播种九千八百多亩，正继续抢种中。光化县已经额超完成今年芝麻播种计划。以芝麻产量高而闻名全国的襄阳县，由于各级党委比较重视，播种工作又快又好，全县已播二十九万多亩，约占计划面积的90％以上。
