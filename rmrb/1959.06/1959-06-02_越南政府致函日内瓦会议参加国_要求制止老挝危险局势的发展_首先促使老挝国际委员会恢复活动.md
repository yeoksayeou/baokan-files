Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, June 1st: Hanoi newspapers today published the letter from the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to the Soviet government on May 30th regarding the current situation in Laos. This letter exposes the acts of the Phoui Sananikone government of Laos in violating the Geneva Accords and demands that measures be taken to halt the development of the serious situation in Laos and to promote the resumption of activities by the International Commission for Laos.

According to the Vietnam News Agency, the Vietnamese government has sent letters with the same content to the governments of all countries that participated in the 1954 Geneva Conference on Indochina.

The letter points out that, from the very beginning, American imperialism and pro-American reactionaries in Laos have tried to obstruct the realization of Lao unification in accordance with the terms of the Geneva Accords on Laos, and have attempted to intensify the use of military force to eliminate the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units gathered in the provinces of Sam Neua and Phong Saly. Although later, due to the urgent demands of the entire Lao people, the sincerity of the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units led by Prince Souphanouvong, and the active efforts of the International Commission for Laos, the Royal Lao Government and the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units signed an agreement on political and military matters, soon afterwards, especially since Phoui Sananikone, known for being pro-American, became Prime Minister, there has been an increasingly serious and planned violation of the Geneva Accords on Laos and a threat to the security of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

The letter states that, towards the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Royal Lao Government is carrying out the conspiracies of American imperialism, encouraging the South Vietnamese authorities to send many plainclothes military personnel to Laos, using Laos as a base for espionage and sabotage activities, and using Dao Van Long from the former French Expeditionary Force and Thai puppet troops to harass the border of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The Royal Lao Government has also increased its troops along the Lao-Vietnamese border, continuously violating the airspace and territory of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

American imperialism has sent a large number of military personnel into Laos and placed these people as advisors in Lao military and police units. American aid organizations have transported hundreds of tons of American weapons and ammunition into Laos, and under the command of American advisors, are expanding and constructing many strategic transportation lines, airports, and military bases.

The Royal Lao Government has intensified its persecution, retaliation, and discrimination against the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units, and has arrested, persecuted, and killed many members of the Lao Patriotic Party (formerly the Pathet Lao Fighting Units).

The letter points out that, for several months, the above-mentioned violations of the agreement have become even more rampant. Following the open abandonment of the Geneva Accords in February of this year, the Phoui Sananikone government recently concentrated a large number of troops in an attempt to disarm the two battalions of the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units stationed in Luang Prabang and Xieng Khouang, and to further eliminate them. Under this threat of violence, one battalion of the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units stationed in Xieng Khouang had no choice but to retreat into the mountains, and they are currently being pursued by the Royal Army; the fate of the battalion originally stationed in Luang Prabang is currently unknown. At the same time as the above-mentioned events, the Royal Lao Government sent troops and police to surround the residences of Lao Patriotic Party leaders, and persecuted Lao Patriotic Party cadres in various regions. These treacherous acts by the Phoui Sananikone government are clearly intended to re-ignite civil war in Laos.

The letter says that, looking at the entire process of the Phoui Sananikone government's violation of the Geneva Accords, it is clear that its actions were prepared and planned in advance, and are part of the overall conspiracy orchestrated by American imperialism in Laos.

The letter states: "As a neighboring country of the Kingdom of Laos, and sharing a border of over one thousand kilometers with Laos, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has consistently hoped to promote friendly relations with the Kingdom of Laos on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. At the same time, as a party to the Geneva Accords on Laos and responsible for overseeing the implementation of this agreement, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam resolutely opposes American imperialism's conspiracy to interfere in Laos, which attempts to turn Laos into an American military base and drag Laos into the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc, preparing to launch a new war. The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam also firmly opposes the above-mentioned actions of the Royal Lao Kingdom's Phoui Sananikone government in violating the Geneva Accords, and solemnly declares that the Phoui Sananikone government must bear full responsibility for the consequences brought about by their actions."

The letter concludes: "For the sake of the peace of the Lao people, the Vietnamese people, and the people of Southeast Asian countries, in order to avoid more serious events occurring in Laos, and in order to ensure that the Geneva Accords on Laos are respected and strictly implemented, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam earnestly hopes that you and your government, in your capacity and responsibility as participants in the Geneva Conference, will actively contribute to halting the serious development of the current situation in Laos, first by promoting the resumption of activities by the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Laos, in order to investigate violations of the Geneva Accords on Laos, and to stop American imperialism's conspiracy to instigate the Phoui Sananikone government to create a dangerous situation harmful to peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia."

    越南政府致函日内瓦会议参加国
    要求制止老挝危险局势的发展
    首先促使老挝国际委员会恢复活动
    新华社河内1日电　河内各报今天发表了越南民主共和国政府5月30日就老挝当前局势写给苏联政府的信。这封信揭露了老挝培·萨纳尼空政府破坏日内瓦协议的行为，并且要求采取措施制止老挝严重局势的发展，促使老挝国际委员会恢复活动。
    据越南通讯社报道，越南政府已经把内容相同的信写给所有参加1954年关于印度支那问题的日内瓦会议的国家的政府。
    这封信指出，从一开始的时候起，美帝国主义和老挝亲美反动分子就竭力阻挠老挝按照关于老挝问题日内瓦协议的条款来实现老挝的统一，并企图加紧施用军事力量来消灭集结在桑怒和丰沙里两省的前寮国战斗部队。尽管后来由于全体老挝人民的迫切要求，由于以苏发努冯亲王为首的前寮国战斗部队的诚意，由于老挝国际委员会的积极努力，老挝王国政府同前寮国战斗部队之间签订了关于政治和军事的协议，但是不久，特别是以亲美知名的培·萨纳尼空出任首相以来，就越来越严重和有计划地破坏关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议和威胁越南民主共和国的安全。
    信中说，对越南民主共和国，老挝王国政府执行美帝国主义的阴谋，怂恿南越当局派许多便装的军事人员到老挝，利用老挝作为进行间谍活动和破坏活动的基地，利用以前法国远征军中的刁文龙和泰国伪军骚扰越南民主共和国边境。老挝王国政府还增派军队到老挝—越南边境沿线，接连侵犯越南民主共和国的领空和领土。
    美帝国主义把大批军事人员派入老挝，并把这些人安插在老挝的军队和警察单位中当顾问。美援机构运入老挝成百吨美国武器和弹药，在美国顾问的指挥下，正在扩建和新建许多战略交通线、机场和军事基地。
    老挝王国政府对前寮国战斗部队加紧迫害、报复和歧视，并且逮捕、迫害和杀死了许多老挝爱国党（前寮国战斗部队）的党员。
    这封信指出，几个月来，上述这种违反协议的行为，更加猖獗起来。培·萨纳尼空政府继今年2月公开毁弃日内瓦协议之后，最近更集中大量军队企图解除驻在琅勃拉邦和川圹的前寮国战斗部队的两个营的武装，和进一步消灭他们。在这种暴力的威胁之下，驻在川圹的前寮国战斗部队的一个营只好撤入山林里，他们现在正被王国军队追击中；还有原驻在琅勃拉邦的一个营，他们的生命如何，目前还不得而知，和上述事件发生的同时，老挝王国政府派军队和警察包围老挝爱国党领袖的住宅，并且迫害老挝爱国党在各地的负责干部。培·萨纳尼空政府的这些背信弃义的行为显然是要在老挝重新发动内战。
    这封信说，综观培·萨纳尼空政府违反日内瓦协议的整个过程，可见它的行动是早有准备和有计划的，是美帝国主义在老挝策划的全部阴谋的一部分。
    这封信说：“作为老挝王国的邻国，并且同老挝有着一千多公里的边界线，越南民主共和国一贯希望在和平共处五项原则的基础上，增进同老挝王国的友好关系，同时作为缔结关于老挝的日内瓦协议的一方和有责任关注这个协议的履行，越南民主共和国政府坚决反对美帝国主义干涉老挝的阴谋，这种阴谋企图把老挝变为美国的军事基地，把老挝拉入东南亚侵略集团，准备发动新的战争。越南民主共和国政府同时坚决反对老挝王国培·萨纳尼空政府上述违反日内瓦协议的行为，并且郑重宣布：培·萨纳尼空政府必须对它们的行动所带来的后果负全部责任。”
    这封信最后说：“为了老挝人民、越南人民和东南亚各国人民的和平利益，为了避免在老挝发生更为严重的事态，为了保证关于老挝的日内瓦协议得到尊重和严正的履行，越南民主共和国政府恳切地希望您和您的政府，以作为日内瓦会议参加国的地位和责任，积极地为制止当前老挝局势的严重发展作出贡献，首先是促使老挝国际监察和监督委员会恢复活动，以便调查违反关于老挝的日内瓦协议的行为，制止美帝国主义唆使培·萨纳尼空政府制造有害于印度支那和东南亚和平的危险局势的阴谋。”
