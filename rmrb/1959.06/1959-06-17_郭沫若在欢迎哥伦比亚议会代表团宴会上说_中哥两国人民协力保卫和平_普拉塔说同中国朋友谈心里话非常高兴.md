Xinhua News Agency, June 16th—Guo Moruo, Chairman of the China Peace Committee, held a banquet tonight to warmly welcome the Colombian Parliamentary Delegation visiting our country.

　　Guo Moruo said in his welcoming speech at the banquet that although Colombia and China are far apart, the people of both countries love peace and are working together for the noble cause of world peace and human happiness. “Long live peace” is the common language of our two peoples.

　　Guo Moruo said that the best way to defend peace is for the people of the two countries to frequently interact with each other, increase mutual understanding, and promote economic and cultural exchanges on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. He passionately expressed that China, on the west coast of the Pacific Ocean, is willing to work with Colombia, on the east coast of the Pacific Ocean, to jointly defend peace, so that the Pacific Ocean surrounded by the two countries becomes a truly peaceful ocean worthy of its name. The Chinese people are willing to work with the Colombian people and the people of all countries in the world to strive for peaceful coexistence and common progress.

　　Dr. Horacio Rodriguez Plata, head of the Colombian Parliamentary Delegation, then delivered a speech. He said that we are very happy, not because we can see beautiful scenery and many beautiful things in China, but because we have this opportunity to talk heart-to-heart with Chinese friends and express our desire for peace to each other.

　　Dr. Horacio Rodriguez Plata said that love of peace is the tradition of the Colombian people. Anyone who has a family, children, and loves their country must love peace, because peace can build, while war destroys everything. He warmly wished the Chinese people, who are building their great motherland in a peaceful environment, greater achievements.

　　At the banquet, Vice Chairman Liao Chengzhi of the China Peace Committee and Dr. Joaquin Franco Burgos, Deputy Head of the Colombian Parliamentary Delegation, and others repeatedly stood up to toast the friendship between the Chinese people and the Colombian people, as well as the people of other Latin American countries, and for world peace. The will to maintain peace stirred everyone's hearts, and everyone's interest grew stronger. At this time, Zhao Feng, a Chinese musician present, stood up and sang a Chinese folk song, followed by Zhu Ziqi, Deputy Secretary-General of the China Peace Committee, who also sang one. As soon as the host's singing ended, Dr. Joaquin Franco Burgos, Deputy Head of the Delegation, could not help but recite a Colombian folk ballad. A burst of cheerful laughter was heard from time to time in the banquet hall.

　　Attending the banquet tonight were Chu Tunan, Lian Guan, Mei Gongbin, Ji Chaoding, Zhang Youyu, Wu Maosun and other people from all walks of life.

    新华社16日讯　中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主席郭沫若今晚举行宴会，热烈欢迎前来我国访问的哥伦比亚议会代表团。
    郭沫若在宴会上致欢迎词说，哥伦比亚和中国虽然相隔很远，但是两国人民却都是爱好和平的，都在共同为世界和平和人类幸福的崇高事业而努力，“和平万岁”就是我们两国人民的共同语言。
    郭沫若说，保卫和平的最好办法就是两国人民间经常相互往来，增加相互间的了解，在平等互利的基础上促进经济和文化的交流。他满怀激情地表示，在太平洋西岸的中国，愿意同在太平洋东岸的哥伦比亚共同努力保卫和平，使两国环抱着的太平洋成为真正符合它的名字的和平的海洋，中国人民愿意同哥伦比亚人民以及世界各国人民一起，争取和平共处、共同进步。
    哥伦比亚议会代表团团长奥拉西奥·罗德里格斯·普拉塔博士接着致词。他说，我们感到非常高兴，这并不是因为我们在中国能看到美丽的风景和许多好看的东西，而是因为我们有这一机会同中国朋友谈心里话，互相倾述爱好和平的心愿。
    奥拉西奥·罗德里格斯·普拉塔博士说，爱好和平是哥伦比亚人民的传统。一切有家、有子女、爱祖国的人，就一定热爱和平的。因为和平能够建设，而战争却是毁灭一切。他热情地祝愿在和平环境中建设自己伟大祖国的中国人民取得更大的成绩。
    在宴会上，和大副主席廖承志和哥伦比亚议会代表团副团长华金·佛朗哥·布尔戈斯博士等一再起立，为中国人民和哥伦比亚人民以及拉丁美洲其他各国人民间的友谊，为世界和平干杯。维护和平的意志激动着每一个人的内心，大家的兴致越来越浓，这时候，在座的我国音乐家赵沨起立唱了一支中国民歌，接着和大副秘书长朱子奇也唱了一支，主人的歌声刚落，代表团副团长华金·佛朗哥·布尔戈斯博士也情不自禁地朗诵了一支哥伦比亚民谣。宴会厅里不时发出了一片愉快的欢笑声。
    出席今晚宴会的有楚图南、连贯、梅龚彬、冀朝鼎、张友渔、吴茂荪等各界人士。
