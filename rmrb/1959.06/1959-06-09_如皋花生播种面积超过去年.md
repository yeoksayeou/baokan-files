Xinhua Daily reported: Rugao County, Jiangsu Province, has planted 121,828 mu of peanuts, accounting for 97.5% of the planned area, an increase of nearly 10,000 mu over last year. Production teams in various people's communes are still carrying out final planting work, striving to exceed the planned area.

Rugao County is a key peanut production area with sandy soil suitable for peanut cultivation, and the masses have many years of experience in cultivating peanuts. The Rugao County Committee of the Communist Party of China summarized last year's bumper harvest experience and decided to start early this year, focusing on early planting, close planting, applying sufficient base fertilizer, and using poisoned grain to control insects to ensure timely planting, expanded area, and full and strong seedlings.

This year, the county's peanut planting generally started ten to fifteen days earlier than last year, and the quality is also higher than in previous years. This year, all selected superior varieties of Western peanuts were used; the stubble arrangement was also more suitable than last year.

Currently, the early peanuts have emerged completely and are growing vigorously, with a lush green scene in the fields. Production teams in various communes are checking seedlings and replanting in individual missing areas to ensure full seedlings. (Attached picture)

    如皋花生播种面积超过去年
    据新华日报报道　江苏如皋县已种好十二万一千八百二十八亩花生，占计划面积的97.5％，比去年扩大近一万亩。各人民公社的生产队，还在进行播种的扫尾工作，力争超过计划面积。
    如皋县是花生重点产区，沙质土壤，适宜种植花生，群众多年来就有培植花生的经验。中共如皋县委总结了去年的丰产经验，决定今年从头抓起，播种期间主要是抓早播，密植，下足基肥，毒谷治虫等措施，保证不误农时、扩大面积、全苗壮苗。
    今年全县播种花生，一般比去年提前十天到十五天，质量也比往年高。今年全部选用西洋生良种；在茬口安排上也比去年适宜。
    目前，早花生出苗齐全，生长旺盛，田间一片嫩绿。各公社生产队正对个别缺塘进行查苗补苗，保证全苗。（附图片）
