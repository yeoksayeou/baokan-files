Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, June 6th: Guangdong Province, China's famous fruit-producing region, has a bumper fruit harvest this year, and large quantities of Lingnan delicacies have been successively entering the market.

This year, Guangdong Province, from the mountainous areas of northern Guangdong to the Pearl River Delta, and from the Chaoshan Plain to Hainan Island, has experienced a generally good fruit harvest. Currently, various early-maturing fruits have been successively entering the market. Bananas, which are available throughout the year, have begun to enter the peak production season, and the amount on the market is rapidly increasing. It is estimated that they can be transported and sold to other places by the end of this month. Among the early spring fruits, lychees first brought good news. Early-maturing lychees such as Sanyuehong and Yuhebao appeared on the market in early May, with daily market volume increasing more than twice compared to last year. The amount transported to Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and other places has also increased significantly compared to previous years. By the end of May, more than 30,000 dan (approximately 1,500 metric tons) had been shipped. Late-maturing lychees such as Black Leaf, Guiwei, and Nuomigao are also ripening on the branches and will soon be available on the market. Other early spring fruits, such as pineapples, fragrant mangoes, and plums, have also been successively entering the market. Among them, the market volume of pineapples is particularly large. In addition to supplying the province, they are also transported and sold to Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and other places every day. (Attached picture)
