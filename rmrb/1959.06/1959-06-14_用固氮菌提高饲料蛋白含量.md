    Using microorganisms to improve the quality of feed can solve the problem of insufficient protein in pigs' roughage and low-protein feeds such as corn and sweet potatoes. The Nutrition Laboratory of the Institute of Animal Husbandry and the Microbiology Laboratory of the Institute of Soil and Fertilizer, both under the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, have jointly conducted experimental research on nitrogen-fixing bacteria in animal husbandry. According to their preliminary experiments: inoculating feed with nitrogen-fixing bacteria can generally increase the crude protein content of the feed by 10%-17% (after four to five days of fermentation after inoculation).
    When there is more crude protein in the feed, the effect on fattening pigs is enhanced accordingly. They conducted a feeding experiment using ten weaned piglets divided into two groups. The five piglets fed with nitrogen-fixing bacteria feed had a total weight gain of 26 kilograms in three weeks, which was 5.6 kilograms more than the five piglets in the control group.

    用固氮菌提高饲料蛋白含量
    利用微生物提高饲料的质量，可以解决猪的粗饲料和玉米、甘薯等低蛋白质饲料的蛋白质不足的问题。中国农业科学院畜牧研究所营养室和土壤肥料所微生物室，共同进行了固氮菌在畜用方面的试验研究。根据他们的初步试验：固氮菌接种在饲料中，一般可把饲料粗蛋白质含量提高10％—17％（接菌种后发酵四、五天）。
    饲料中的粗蛋白质多了，肥育猪的效果就随着加强。他们用离乳小猪十头分两组进行饲养试验，喂固氮菌饲料的五头，三周的总增重量是二十六公斤，比对照组的五头猪多增重五点六公斤。
