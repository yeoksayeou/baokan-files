Resonating in the Heart, Remembered in the Mind
——Elder Xu Discusses Teacher Training College Applications with Young Students
Bai Sheng

One midsummer evening, in a small garden, a gentle breeze carried a delicate fragrance. Xu Teli, the eighty-two-year-old revolutionary educationist, having just recovered from his illness, warmly received a group of high school graduates here.

Like a kind old grandfather telling stories to children on a quiet summer night, Elder Xu sat in a rattan chair, while the young people sat on stone stools beside him. With boundless respect, the young people shared their fervent aspirations – to enter teacher training college – with Elder Xu. Elder Xu, who had taught for decades, looked kindly at these successors, praising their ambitions and supporting their requests.

Elder Xu warmly told the young people that the work of a teacher is not only an honorable and important position but also a noble and joyful career. It plays a significant role in the cultivation of national talent, the development of cultural, scientific, and educational undertakings, and the growth of the next generation. Teaching is not just about imparting knowledge; more importantly, it is about educating people, nurturing the next generation to become individuals with communist ideological qualities. Therefore, the ideological quality of those who study at teacher training colleges and become people's teachers is particularly important. Precisely because of this, studying at teacher training colleges requires students who are relatively excellent in their studies and thinking.

Talking about teaching, Elder Xu continued, "Of course, it is not only those who study at teacher training colleges who can teach. But a teacher who understands pedagogy, psychology, and teaching methods will always teach better. Moreover, having studied at teacher training college, one has already initially established the ideological feelings of being a people's teacher! Teaching is a very joyful career; the more you teach, the more you will love your career. When you see the students you have taught going to life in batches and contributing to society, how happy you will be! 'The student surpasses the teacher,' and 'later generations surpass the earlier ones,' doesn't this also contain a portion of your hard work!" Isn't Elder Xu precisely an old educationist who loves the cause of education? How deeply he loves the cause of education and the "numerous students"! The deeds of sharing hardships with students and caring for their lives and studies at all times are so touching! During his time teaching at Changsha Women's Normal School, Elder Xu served as the principal, teacher, and school worker. In addition to teaching classes every day, he personally rang the bell and swept the floor. At night, he would sit under the kerosene lamp to grade students' homework. During his time teaching at Changsha Normal School and Hunan First Women's Normal School, Elder Xu often patrolled the student dormitories after the lights were turned off, caring for the students' sleep and health. Therefore, the female students of the First Women's Normal School affectionately called him "Grandma." Even now, when some of his former students come to Beijing, they still affectionately inquire about "Grandma's" health!

After Elder Xu solemnly said, "If a person wants to do something vigorously and make contributions to society, then he must pay a great price," the young people's thinking became more enlightened. They clearly realized: "Isn't it because our predecessors paid a great price that we are able to live so happily today? Revolutionary predecessors often sacrificed their lives for the revolutionary cause one after another; that is such a great price! Can it be that we who study at teacher training colleges and become people's teachers are unwilling to make even this small contribution to society to cultivate a new generation for the motherland!"

After a moment of silence, the young people were all pondering Elder Xu's words. Elder Xu said again, "If a person has good thoughts, is enthusiastic about learning, and is willing to use his brain, and is also more concerned about various things, then his progress will be very fast, and the knowledge he has learned will continue to increase. Such a young person, no matter what he studies, will be good, will have achievements, and will have a future."

Elder Xu, this old educationist, an old revolutionary veteran, then recalled the scene when he taught at Hunan First Normal School. He said, "When I taught at Hunan First Normal School, because that school was a revolutionary red school, I and many teachers and students were all influenced by the revolution. At that time, teachers and students helped each other to make progress, and many good teachers and good students were good party members. Unfortunately, many of my students have sacrificed for the revolutionary cause."

When Elder Xu was sixteen years old, he taught in a village private school, earning only three strings of copper coins a year, but at that time, buying a "Thirteen Classics with Commentaries and Subcommentaries" cost fifteen strings of copper coins. The cause of education was unattended to at that time. Elder Xu recalled his teaching life in those years and said with emotion, "I didn't have such a good opportunity to study at teacher training college in the past as you do now! I only attended a private school for a few years. When I was sixteen years old, I went to teach in a private school, and later I taught in elementary schools, middle schools, and normal schools, and I have been teaching for decades. Because I love my teaching profession, I took out my income to run schools. When I didn't have money, I contributed my labor. In this way, I learned while teaching, and as the "water rises, the boat rises," I gained a lot of knowledge."

Elder Xu's recollections deeply moved the young students and also moved me. Chairman Mao said in a letter congratulating Elder Xu on his sixtieth birthday more than twenty years ago: "You were my teacher twenty years ago, you are still my teacher now, and you will definitely still be my teacher in the future." Chairman Mao affectionately expressed the students' eternal love for their teachers. A person will never forget the teachers who taught him and nurtured his growth. They are always filled with gratitude to recall their teachers.

In the quiet dusk, the young people were all holding their breath. Elder Xu's patient and earnest voice, through the midsummer twilight, deeply resonated in the hearts of the young people and was remembered in their minds.

    响在心上，记在心里
    ——徐老和青年学生们谈投考师范问题
    柏生
    一个仲夏的傍晚，在一座小花园里，微风送来幽香。八十二岁的革命老教育家徐特立，病后刚刚恢复健康，就在这儿亲切地接待了一群高中毕业生。
    像慈祥的老祖父在静静的夏夜里和孩子们讲故事一般，徐老坐在一张藤椅上，青年人坐在他身旁的石凳上。怀着无限崇敬的心情，青年人把自己火一样的志愿——去进师范，告诉给徐老。教了几十年书的徐老，亲切地望着这群后继者，赞美他们的志愿，支持他们的要求。
    徐老亲切地告诉青年们，教师工作不仅是一个光荣重要的岗位，而且是一种崇高而愉快的事业。它对国家人材的培养，文化科学教育事业的发展，以及后一代的成长，起着重大作用。教书不仅是传授知识，更重要的是教人，教育后一代成长为具有共产主义思想品质的人。因此，学师范，做人民教师的人，他的思想品质的好坏，也就格外显得重要。正因为这样，学师范也就需要学习、思想各方面都比较优秀的人来学。
    谈到教书，徐老接下去说：“当然并不是只有学师范的人才能教书。可是一个懂得教育学、心理学、教学法的教师，教起书来总要比较好些。何况学了师范，已经初步树立了做人民教师的思想感情呢！教书是一种很愉快的事业，你越教就会越爱自己的事业。当你看到你教出来的学生一批批地走向生活，为社会做出贡献时，你会多么高兴呵！青出于蓝，而胜于蓝，后来居上，这里不也正包含着你的一份辛勤的成绩在里面吗！”徐老不正是热爱教育事业的一位老教育家吗？他是怎样地热爱教育事业，热爱“莘莘学子”啊！那些和学生共艰苦，时时刻刻关怀学生生活和学习的事迹，多么感动人啊！徐老在长沙女子师范教书时代，曾经一身兼任校长、教员和校工。每天除教课外，还亲自摇铃，扫地。夜晚，他还要坐在煤油灯下为学生批改作业。在长沙师范以及湖南第一女子师范教书时代，徐老经常在熄灯后到学生宿舍去巡视，关怀学生的睡眠和健康。因此，那时第一女子师范的女学生们就亲热地称呼他叫“外婆”。甚至现在还有些他当年的学生到北京来的时候，还要亲切地探问“外婆”的健康呢！
    在徐老严肃地说过“一个人要想轰轰烈烈地搞什么，对社会作出贡献来，那他就要付出很大的代价来”以后，青年们的思想更加豁然开朗了。他们明确地认识到：“我们今天所以能够生活得这样幸福，不就是我们的先辈付出了很大的代价换取来的么？革命先辈常常前仆后继地把生命贡献给革命事业，那是多么大的代价！难道我们学师范做人民教师，为祖国培养新的一代，这点小小的贡献都不肯给社会么！”
    沉默了一下，青年人都在回味着徐老的话。徐老又说：“一个人如果思想好，学习热情，又肯用脑，对各种事物也比较关心，那他的进步是很快的，所学得的知识也就会不断增加。这样的青年，无论学什么都好，都会有成绩，有前途。”
    徐老，这位老教育家、老革命前辈，这时回忆起自己当年在湖南第一师范学校教书时的情景来。他说，“我在湖南第一师范教书时，因那个学校是个革命的红色学校，我和许多师生都一起接受了革命的影响，那时真是师生互相帮助进步，许多好教员、好学生都是好党员，可惜我的许多学生都已为革命事业牺牲了。”
    徐老十六岁的时候，就在乡村教蒙馆，全年只得三串铜钱，可是那时买一部“十三经注疏”却要十五串铜钱。教育事业在那个时候是无人过问的。徐老回忆起自己当年的教书生活来，他感慨地说：“我过去想学师范都没有你们这样好的机会呢！我只上了几年蒙馆。到我十六岁时，就去教蒙馆，以后我又教小学、中学和师范，一直教了几十年的书。我因为热爱自己的教书职业，把自己的收入也拿出来办学，没钱时，我就出力。就这样边教边学，“水涨船高”，我获得了许多知识。”
    徐老的回忆，深深地感动了青年学生们，也感动了我。毛主席在二十多年前祝贺徐老六十寿辰的信说：“你是我二十年前的先生，你现在仍然是我的先生，你将来必定还是我的先生。”毛主席亲切地道出了学生们对教师永远敬爱的心声。一个人是永远不会忘记教导过自己、培养自己成长的教师的。他们总是经常充满了感激之情来回忆自己的老师的。
    静谧的黄昏，青年人个个屏静着。徐老循循善诱的声音，透过了仲夏的暮色，深深地响在青年们的心上，记在青年们的心里。
