Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, June 28th: More than 200,000 Hanoi citizens held a grand rally this morning in Ba Dinh Square to welcome President Sukarno of the Republic of Indonesia. The masses enthusiastically cheered the unbreakable fighting friendship between the peoples of Vietnam and Indonesia.

  After an address by Tran Duy Hung, Chairman of the Hanoi Municipal Administrative Committee, President Sukarno delivered a speech at the rally. In his speech, he emphasized that the peoples of Indonesia and Vietnam are fighting side by side against imperialism and for freedom; at the same time, they are also jointly striving to build a new life. Therefore, the hearts of the two peoples are linked together.

  President Sukarno said: "Indonesia and Vietnam are still divided, so we must strengthen the struggle to achieve the unification of our homelands. I believe that Indonesia will definitely achieve unification, and Vietnam will definitely achieve unification!"

  President Sukarno said: "We face a common enemy, and that is imperialism. Imperialism uses two kinds of weapons against us, one is material weapons: armies, airplanes, artillery, warships, police, prisons, etc.; the other is spiritual weapons, such as the conspiracy of 'divide and rule,' which is a dangerous weapon. For many years, imperialism has used this weapon against Indonesia, alienating the various ethnic groups of Indonesia and making them hostile to each other. However, since we regained our independence, the people of our country have united, and relying on this unity, we have overcome all the enemy's modern weapons."

  President Sukarno said: "Imperialism not only alienates the people within a country, but also alienates the peoples of Asian, African and other countries, making the various nations hostile to each other and vying with each other. An American reporter once said: 'We should try to get Asians to fight Asians.' However, after the Bandung Conference, we are no longer isolated countries, we have united to form an invincible force."

  President Sukarno emphasized: "Where there is unity, there is strength; where there is division, there is weakness."

  Chairman Ho Chi Minh then spoke. He said that President Sukarno's visit to Vietnam demonstrates his deep friendship towards the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. He said: "To summarize President Sukarno's kind words, it is that although the peoples of Indonesia and Vietnam are thousands of miles apart, their hearts are always together, truly friends and brothers." The central meaning of his speech was: "Unity, unity, and more unity; any difficulty can be overcome, any enemy can be crushed, and any victory can be achieved."

  Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, June 28th: Indonesian President Sukarno declared here today that Indonesia will never compromise with imperialism. He said: "Imperialism is a bad thing in the world."

  He also declared at a press conference: "We are always opposed to the division of countries."

  President Sukarno said: "This era is the era of national liberation and national construction." He said: "Any instance and any theory that does not recognize this fact is blind and anti-historical."

  He pointed out: "Nothing can take away Indonesia's independence." Sukarno said: "We will resolutely promote the complete elimination of the last vestiges of colonialism in our country."

  He continued: "In this way, we will build a strong country, a strong country of unity and freedom. In this way, West Irian will inevitably return to our jurisdiction."

  Speaking of the cause of defending peace, Sukarno said: "We must strive to ensure that atomic energy is used only for peaceful construction purposes, and at the same time, we must constantly devote ourselves to the cause of national liberation and national unity."

  In his statement, Sukarno conveyed Indonesia's fraternal respect to the Vietnamese people.

  After reading his above written statement at the press conference, President Sukarno answered some questions raised by the reporters.

  In response to a question about his impressions of this trip around various countries, Sukarno said that the people of all countries love and demand peace, and we must continue to fight for peace.

  Sukarno said that some national leaders said that they were afraid of a communist attack. Sukarno said that, in his opinion, communists are not warmongers, they are peace-loving people.

    河内市民盛会欢迎苏加诺总统
    苏加诺胡志明强调两国友好团结
    苏加诺声明说印度尼西亚将永不向帝国主义妥协
    新华社河内28日电　河内二十多万市民今天上午在巴亭广场举行盛大集会，欢迎印度尼西亚共和国总统苏加诺。到会群众热烈欢呼越南—印度尼西亚两国人民之间的牢不可破的战斗友谊。
  在河内市行政委员会主席陈维兴致词后，苏加诺总统在大会上发表了讲话。他在讲话中强调指出，印度尼西亚和越南人民正在并肩为反对帝国主义和为自由而斗争；同时，也在为建设新生活而共同进行斗争。因此，两国人民心连着心。
    苏加诺总统说：“印度尼西亚和越南还都被分割着，所以我们要加强斗争，争取祖国的统一。我相信，印度尼西亚一定会实现统一，越南一定会实现统一！”
    苏加诺总统说：“我们面对共同的敌人，那就是帝国主义。帝国主义用两种武器来反对我们，一种是物质的武器：军队、飞机、大炮、兵舰、警察、监狱等等；一种是精神的武器，如‘分而治之’的阴谋手段，这是一种危险的武器，许多年来，帝国主义对印度尼西亚使用了这种武器，它们离间印度尼西亚各族人民，使他们互相敌视。但是，自从我们恢复独立以来，我们全国人民已经团结起来了，依靠这种团结，我们战胜了敌人的一切现代化武器。”
    苏加诺总统说：“帝国主义不但离间一个国家中的人民，也离间亚非各国和其他各国的人民，使各民族之间互相敌视，互相倾轧。一个美国记者曾经说：‘我们应当设法使亚洲人打亚洲人’。可是，在万隆会议之后，我们已经不是单独的国家了，我们已经团结起来，形成了不可战胜的力量。”
    苏加诺总统强调说：“那里团结一致，那里就强大有力；那里还存在着分裂，那里就虚弱无力。”
    胡志明主席接着讲了话。他说，苏加诺总统的访问越南表明了他对越南民主共和国的深厚友谊。他说：“把苏加诺总统的亲切的讲话归纳起来，那就是：印度尼西亚和越南人民虽然远隔万里，心却常在一起，真正是朋友兄弟。”而他的讲话的中心意思是：“团结、团结、再团结，任何困难也能克服，任何敌人也能粉碎，任何胜利也能取得。”
    据新华社河内28日电　印度尼西亚总统苏加诺今天在这里发表声明说，印度尼西亚将永远不向帝国主义妥协。他说：“帝国主义是世界上的一种坏东西。”
    他在记者招待会上还声明：“我们永远反对国家被分裂。”
    苏加诺总统说：“这个时代是民族解放和建设国家的时代。”他说：“不承认这个事实的任何事例和任何理论，都是盲目的和反历史的。”
    他指出：“任何东西都不能夺去印度尼西亚的独立”。苏加诺说：“我们将坚决促使在我国的殖民主义的最后残余全部消灭。”
    他接着说：“这样，我们将建成一个强大的国家，一个团结和自由的强大国家。这样，西伊里安必然回到我们的管辖之下。”
    苏加诺谈到保卫和平的事业时说：“我们必须努力促使原子能只使用于和平建设的目的，同时必须不断致力于民族解放和民族团结的事业。”
    苏加诺在他的声明里转达了印度尼西亚对越南人民的兄弟般的敬意。
    苏加诺总统在记者招待会上宣读了他的上述书面声明以后，回答了记者们提出的一些问题。
    在回答关于这次周游各国的观感的时候，苏加诺说，各国人民都热爱和要求和平，我们要继续为和平而斗争。
    苏加诺谈到，有些国家的领导人说，他们害怕共产主义进攻。苏加诺说，据他看来，共产主义者不是好战分子，他们是爱好和平的人。
