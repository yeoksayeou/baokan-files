Editorial Note:

	Everything for Increasing Grain Production

The Hunan Province's Grain Thousand-Jin High-Yield Campaign has a clear goal: to increase total grain production. The foundation of this campaign is very solid: on the one hand, it focuses on large-area thousand-jin high yields, and on the other hand, it focuses on comprehensive and balanced production increase, without abandoning either. There are differences and connections between these two. If we only see their differences, it is easy to overlook comprehensive and balanced production increase when grasping large-area high yields. However, in order to increase total grain production, we must not only grasp large-area high yields, but also base it on comprehensive and balanced production increase, which is the connection between the two. It is very necessary for Hunan to stipulate different indicators for other regions according to different situations while stipulating indicators for large-area high-yield fields.

    一切为了增产粮食
    湖南开展的粮食千斤丰产运动，目标明确，是为了增加粮食的总产量。这个运动的基础很坚实：一方面是抓大面积千斤高产。一方面是抓全面平衡增产，不偏弃其一。这两者有区别又有联系。如果我们只看到它们的区别，在抓大面积丰产的时候，便容易忽视全面平衡增产。然而，为了增加粮食总产量，不仅要抓大面积高产，又必须以全面平衡增产为基础，这就是两者之间的联系。湖南在规定大面积高产田指标的同时，对其他地区又分别情况规定了不同的指标，这样做是很必要的。
