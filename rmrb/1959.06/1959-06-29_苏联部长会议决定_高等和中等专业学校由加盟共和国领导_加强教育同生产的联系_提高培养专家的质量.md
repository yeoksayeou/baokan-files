　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 28th: TASS reports that the Soviet Council of Ministers recently passed a decision regarding the reorganization of the leadership of Soviet higher and secondary specialized schools. According to this decision, higher and secondary specialized schools previously managed by the All-Union government will be transferred to the leadership of the Councils of Ministers of the respective Union Republics.

　　The decision points out that the purpose of the reorganization is to further develop and improve the Soviet higher and secondary specialized education system, strengthen the connection between education and production, improve practical education for university students, and expand the rights of the Union Republics.

　　The decision suggests that the Councils of Ministers of the Union Republics discuss and resolve the issue of the organizational leadership forms for leading higher and secondary specialized schools within the republics.

　　The decision notes that Soviet higher and secondary specialized schools have played a significant role in realizing the great achievements of the Soviet people and in the construction of communism.

　　The fact that there are currently 7.5 million experts with higher and secondary specialized education working on various fronts of the national economy is one of the great achievements of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet state.

　　The decision states that the new and grand economic and cultural tasks put forward by the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union require further expansion and improvement of the work of training experts.

　　According to the 1959-1965 Seven-Year Plan, Soviet higher education institutions should train 2.3 million experts, which is 40% more than during the period of 1952-1958. During the coming seven years, secondary specialized schools will enroll 4 million students.

　　The decision says that special attention should be paid to further improving the quality of expert training. Modern production, based on new scientific and technological achievements, requires graduates of higher and secondary specialized schools to have a high level of theoretical education and a thorough knowledge of production practice.

　　The legal provisions on strengthening the connection between schools and life and on further developing the Soviet national education system require improving the existing system of higher and secondary specialized education, so that the current education system is closer to production. More young people with life experience and practical work experience will be enrolled in higher education institutions.

　　The decision says that higher education and secondary specialized education have been widely developed in the Union Republics. During the Soviet era, universities, higher technical schools, agricultural schools, medical, teacher training, and other higher education institutions have been established in the Union Republics. A large network of secondary specialized schools has been formed. The ranks of skilled experts in the Union Republics have grown.

　　The decision concludes by pointing out that the reorganization of the leadership of higher and secondary specialized schools will promote the further improvement of the work of training experts for the national economy and culture.
