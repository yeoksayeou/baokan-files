“Langtiqiu” is the largest festival celebrated by the Yao people on the 29th day of the fifth lunar month. Legend has it that a long time ago, the Yao people's ancestor was imprisoned by the local chieftain for mobilizing the masses to resist the chieftain's extortion. In order to rescue their ancestor, the Yao people rose up in resistance. After continuous struggle, they finally rescued him on the 29th day of the fifth month. To celebrate their victory, the Yao people would slaughter pigs and sheep and invite relatives and friends for a feast every year on the 29th day of the fifth month. Therefore, this day is called "Langtiqiu" – the Danu Festival.

Since liberation, under the correct leadership of the Communist Party, the Yao people have eradicated poverty and their lives have become increasingly happy. The Yao's "Langtiqiu" celebration is becoming more joyous every year. Nowadays, every year when the festival arrives, the Yao people put on beautiful costumes, wear silver necklaces and bracelets, and dance the bronze drum dance. In 1956, the "Bronze Drum Dance" was even performed at Huairentang in Beijing. The Yao people proudly say, "The bronze drum dance can go to Beijing to see Chairman Mao. This is our Yao family's happiness, and it is the wise leadership of the Communist Party!" Now, the Yao people all say, "As soon as the bronze drum sounds, the enthusiasm comes!" Especially during last year's Great Leap Forward, the "Langtiqiu" festival was celebrated even more enthusiastically and meaningfully. People eliminated waste while celebrating the festival by launching crash programs to accumulate fertilizer and improve summer planting. They organized field armies, canteens, and nurseries to camp in the mountains, launching a massive fertilizer production campaign. Red flags fluttered all over the mountains, the bronze drums sounded ding-dong, and songs continued day and night:

	Thousands of mountains and valleys are filled with yellow corn,
	The bronze drum shakes the Dong village;
	The food is hot and the rice wine fragrant,
	Respectfully dedicated to Huairentang in Beijing. (Image attached)

    达努节
    “浪提球”是瑶族人民在农历五月二十九日举行的最大节日。传说很久以前，瑶族人民的老祖公因为发动群众抗拒土司的勒索，被当时的土司关押起来。为了拯救祖公，瑶族人民纷纷起来反抗，经过不断斗争，瑶族人民终于在五月二十九日把祖公拯救出来。为了庆祝胜利，瑶族人民每逢五月二十九日便杀猪宰羊叫亲朋知友痛饮。因此，人们管这天叫“浪提球”——达努节。
    解放以后，在共产党的正确领导下，瑶族人民永远挖掉了穷根，日子过得越来越幸福，瑶家的“浪提球”也一年比一年过得更欢心。现在，每年一到这个节日，瑶族人民就穿起美丽的服装，戴起银质的项圈和手饰跳铜鼓舞，1956年“铜鼓舞”还在北京怀仁堂演出。瑶族人民这样骄傲地说：“铜鼓舞能上北京见毛主席，这是我们瑶家的幸福，是共产党的英明领导！”现在，瑶家人都说：“铜鼓一响，干劲就来了！”特别是去年大跃进的时候，“浪提球”节过得更热闹和更有意义了。人们一面杜绝浪费，一面以突击积肥搞好夏种来欢度这个佳节。他们组织野战军、食堂和托儿组在山上扎营，掀起大制肥山肥海运动，满山遍野红旗招展，铜鼓叮叮咚咚，歌声日夜不停：
    千山万?玉米黄，铜鼓叮咚震峒场；
    饭菜热腾米酒香，遥敬北京怀仁堂。（附图片）
