Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, 2nd. (By our reporter, Wan Guang) Since the foreign ministers of Eastern and Western countries began informal talks last week to discuss specific issues, and since the plenary sessions have focused on the Berlin issue, the Geneva Conference has entered a new stage.

By discussing specific issues, the conference may be able to achieve positive results on some concrete problems and reach agreement on specific arrangements for holding a summit meeting of Eastern and Western countries. Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko reiterated at the plenary session last weekend that the Soviet Union is doing its utmost to achieve this. The question now is whether the Western foreign ministers are truly willing to change and adopt a positive attitude.

Many signs indicate that the road to a positive development of the conference is by no means smooth. The possibility of a bright future for the conference has caused some forces in the West to panic. They are making a final stand from all sides, attempting to exert pressure on the Foreign Ministers' Conference and sabotage it.

The "New York Herald Tribune" on June 1 prominently published the talks of "American officials" in Geneva. These officials flatly denied that the United States was prepared to make "unilateral concessions" on the West Berlin issue. On the same day, the newspaper also coordinated with an article by David Lawrence, which emphasized that "the important thing for Westerners and the Western press is not to rush," "they must be patient and let their representatives here (Geneva) show a firm attitude." This reactionary columnist has been advocating that the Foreign Ministers' Conference will break up without any results. He fundamentally opposes holding a summit meeting and even openly scolds the public in various countries who expect the Foreign Ministers' Conference and the summit meeting to achieve positive results as being "naive and ignorant" and "misguided." Lawrence's argument is not without reason. This argument is not isolated; it is part of a wave of propaganda in many American newspapers these days. For example, the editorial of the "New York Daily News" on May 30 also advocated that "the West must take a firm attitude when dealing with the Soviet Union." This newspaper also argued that if a summit meeting is to be held, the Soviet Union must first "pay a frightening price." Obviously, all this cannot but be said to reflect the attitude of some powerful groups in the United States today.

West German Foreign Minister Brentano, after returning to Bonn to receive secret instructions from Adenauer, has stepped up his sabotage activities here. Brentano and West German delegation spokesman Eckardt have been constantly clamoring that the West must not allow any of the Soviet Union's hopes to be realized. They also made no secret of the fact that they hoped the Foreign Ministers' Conference would "end in failure."

The powerful groups in the United States, colluding with the West German Adenauer government, are putting pressure on their allies in an attempt to make them follow the same path. Against this background, the news published in the London "Times" on June 1 that Macmillan was going to replace Foreign Secretary Lloyd has aroused a lot of discussion here. Some people pointed out that publishing such news at the present time is a "warning" deliberately issued to Lloyd by a section of the British ruling group, because Lloyd is considered to be "moderately optimistic" about the outcome of the Foreign Ministers' Conference and has repeatedly expressed the need to hold a summit meeting. Some people here also linked the "Times" news with the recent promise by West German Defense Minister Strauss during his visit to Britain to order goods from some British arms dealers, believing that the "Times" was instructed to publish the news by certain forces in Britain who are colluding with West German militarists, a force that has experience in behind-the-scenes deals with Hitler during World War II. The "Times" news greatly surprised the British delegation here. According to today's British newspapers, Lloyd immediately spoke to Macmillan by telephone, and then Macmillan hurriedly gave Lloyd a "private telegram" expressing his "full confidence" in him.

The adverse current rushing towards the Geneva Conference is still not small. However, the will of peace-loving people in various countries cannot be ignored. Thanks to the active initiative of the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic, and thanks to the strong pressure from the public in Europe and other countries around the world, the West has been forced to open the notorious "package plan" at the Foreign Ministers' Conference, which was intended to block any agreement from being reached, and has begun to sit down and discuss specific issues. The people of all countries must not tolerate the conference being obstructed and sabotaged again in its new stage. The attitude of the Western foreign ministers is facing a decisive test.

    日内瓦外长会议进入讨论具体问题新阶段
    西方国家面临决定性考验
    反动势力惊恐万分加紧进行破坏活动
    新华社日内瓦2日电　本社记者万光报道：从东西方国家外长上周开始讨论具体问题的非正式会谈，以及在全体会议上集中讨论柏林问题以来，日内瓦会议进入了一个新的阶段。
    通过具体问题的讨论，会议便有可能在一些具体问题上取得积极结果，并且在举行东西方国家政府首脑会议的具体安排上达成协议。苏联外交部长葛罗米柯在上周末的全体会议上又一次表明，苏联正为此而竭尽努力。现在的问题是，西方国家外长们是否真正愿意改而采取积极态度。
    不少迹象显示，会议朝着积极方向发展的道路还决不是平坦的。会议的明朗前景出现的可能性，使得西方的某些势力惊恐万分，他们正在从各个方面进行最后的顽抗，企图对外长会议施加压力，进行破坏。
    6月1日的“纽约先驱论坛报”上，以显著地位刊载了在日内瓦的
  “美国官员们”的谈话。这些官员们断然否认美国准备在西柏林问题上作出“单方面的让步”。这家报纸在同一天还配合以戴维·劳伦斯的一篇文章，文章里强调，“对于西方人和西方报纸来说，重要的事情是不要着急”，“他们必须忍耐，并且让他们在这里（日内瓦）的代表表现坚决态度”。这个反动专栏作家一直是鼓吹外长会议会毫无结果而散伙的，他根本反对举行政府首脑会议，甚至公开责骂期望外长会议和政府首脑会议取得积极成果的各国公众“幼稚无知”，认识错误”。劳伦斯的这种论调并不是没有来由的。这种论调并不孤立，它是美国不少报刊这些天来宣传浪潮的一个部分。像5月30日“纽约每日新闻”的社论也鼓吹什么“西方在同苏联打交道时必需采取坚定态度”，这家报纸并且主张，如果要召开政府首脑会议的话，首先要使苏联“付出吓人的价钱”。显然，这一切不能不说是反映了当前美国一些有势力集团的态度。
    西德外长勃伦塔诺在返回波恩接受阿登纳秘密指示后，已经加紧了在这里的破坏活动。勃伦塔诺和西德代表团发言人埃卡特在不断叫嚷，西方决不能让苏联的任何希望实现。他们并且毫不掩饰地表明，他们指望外长会议“以失败告终”。
    美国的有势力集团同西德阿登纳政府勾结在一起，正在对他们的盟国施加压力，企图使它们遵循同一路线。在这种背景下，伦敦“泰晤士报”6月1日刊载的麦克米伦将要撤换劳埃德外交大臣职务的消息，引起了这里人士的纷纷议论。一些人士指出，在目前时机发表这样一条消息，是英国统治集团里有一部分人特意对劳埃德发出的“警告”，因为劳埃德被认为是对外长会议结果抱有“有限度的乐观”，并且一再表示过需要召开政府首脑会议的。这里有些人士并且把“泰晤士报”这条消息同最近西德国防部长斯特劳斯在访问英国期间答应向英国一些军火商订货的事情联系起来，认为授意“泰晤士报”发表这条消息的，是英国某些同西德军国主义者相勾结的势力，这种势力是有着在第二次世界大战时同希特勒幕后交易的经验的。“泰晤士报”的消息使得这里的英国代表团大为惊讶，据今天的英国报纸报道，劳埃德当即用电话同麦克米伦通话，然后麦克米伦赶忙给劳埃德一封“私人电报”，表示对他“充分信任”。
    向日内瓦会议冲击而来的逆流仍然不小。但是，各国爱好和平公众的意志是不能被忽视的。由于苏联和德意志民主共和国的积极主动，由于欧洲和世界各国公众的强大压力，西方在外长会议上已经被迫打开了臭名远扬的、旨在堵塞会议达成任何协议的“一揽子计划”，而开始坐下来讨论具体问题了。各国公众决不能容忍会议在它的新阶段里再受阻挠和破坏。西方国家外长们的态度，正面临决定性的考验。
