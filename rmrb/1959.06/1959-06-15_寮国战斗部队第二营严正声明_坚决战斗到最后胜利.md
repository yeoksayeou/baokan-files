Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, June 14th: A message from 川圹 [Xiangkhouang] : The "川圹 [Xiangkhouang] Lao Patriotic Front News" published on June 12 a statement issued by the Second Battalion of the Laotian Combat Forces, exposing that the Lao authorities are stepping up the expansion of the civil war and announcing that the Laotian Combat Forces will fight to the final victory.

    The statement said: Deputy Minister of Propaganda of the Royal Government, Sisouk Na Champassak, announced on Vientiane Radio on June 8 that the war in 川圹 [Xiangkhouang] had ended. But in fact, they are continuing to expand the civil war. For several days, they have been constantly increasing their forces, besieging and attacking our units. In the area between Muang Phanh and the Lao-Vietnamese border, the war is continuing.

    The statement pointed out that the Phoui Sananikone government has not abandoned its conspiracy of civil war. On the contrary, they continue to attack, sweep and suppress the people, and arrest everyone suspected of being former resistance personnel. Sisouk Na Champassak's statement is intended to cover up the facts, but in reality, the clear fact that they are openly launching a civil war cannot be concealed.

    The statement said that we once stated in a letter to the people and the Royal Army that in order to realize the Patriotic Party's policy of national unity, we had withdrawn from the two provinces to merge with the Royal Army. This demonstrates our sincerity. But the Lao people will never allow the Phoui Sananikone government to do whatever it wants, nor will they allow them to tear up the signed agreements at will and act as running dogs of the United States. We advocate national unity, and Lao people do not fight Lao people, but we will never allow them to disarm and eliminate us.

    The statement said, let us tell them: it is absolutely impossible for them to eliminate the Second Battalion. The more they attack, the greater the losses they will suffer. We are determined to fight in self-defense. We have repelled their many attacks, and we will repel all their attacks. We must fight resolutely and smash all their conspiracies.

    The statement said that we, together with the people, demand that they no longer act as running dogs of the United States and serve the United States; demand that they immediately stop the acts of arresting and massacring the people; and demand that they thoroughly fulfill the agreements that have been signed.

    The statement pointed out that their actions are unjust. The people will never support them. In particular, the people of 川圹 [Xiangkhouang], who have been engaged in the war of resistance for many years, will not support them. If they continue to suppress them, not only the people of 川圹 [Xiangkhouang], but also the people of the whole country will rise up against them. The Phoui Sananikone clique's conspiracy must fail. The people must win!

    寮国战斗部队第二营严正声明
    坚决战斗到最后胜利
    新华社河内14日电　川圹消息：“川圹老挝爱国者消息报”6月12日登载寮国战斗部队第二营发表的一项声明，揭露老挝当局正在加紧扩大内战，并且宣布寮国战斗部队将战斗到最后的胜利。
    声明说：王国政府宣传副大臣西苏·纳占巴萨6月8日在万象电台宣布说，川圹的战事已经结束了。可是事实上，他们正在继续扩大内战。几天以来，他们不断增加兵力，包围、进攻我们的各个单位。在芒邦和老越边界之间的地带，战事正在继续进行。
    声明指出，培·萨纳尼空政府并没有放弃内战的阴谋。相反地，他们继续在进攻、扫荡和镇压人民，逮捕被怀疑是前抗战人员的一切人。西苏·纳占巴萨的声明目的在于掩盖事实，但实际上，他们公然发动内战的明白事实是掩盖不了的。
    声明说，我们曾经在告人民和王国军队书中说明，为了实现爱国党的民族团结政策，我们曾经从两省撤出来同王国军队合并。这表现了我们的诚意。但是老挝人民决不许培·萨纳尼空政府为所欲为，不许他们随意撕毁签订的协议，充当美国的走狗。我们主张民族团结，老挝人不打老挝人，但我们决不许他们解除我们的武装和消灭我们。
    声明说，让我们告诉他们：他们绝对不可能消灭第二营。他们越是进攻，就一定要受到越大的损失。我们决心进行自卫战斗。我们已经打退了他们的多次进攻，我们还要打退他们的一切进攻。我们要坚决战斗，粉碎他们的一切阴谋。
    声明说，我们同人民一起，要求他们不再充当美国的走狗，为美国效劳；要求他们立即停止逮捕、屠杀人民的行动；要求他们彻底履行已经签订的协议。
    声明指出，他们的行动是反正义的。人民决不会支持他们。特别是曾经进行过多年抗战的川圹人民更不会支持他们。他们再镇压下去，不但川圹人民，而且全国人民都要起来反对他们。培·萨纳尼空集团的阴谋一定要失败。人民一定胜利！
