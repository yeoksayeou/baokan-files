    Joyful Frontier
    This Year's Water-Splashing Festival
    The seventh day after the Qingming Festival each year is the Water-Splashing Festival of the Dai people.
    This year, all Dai people's communes and agricultural cooperatives in the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture took a day off. More than 170,000 Dai farmers joyfully celebrated the unforgettable festival after the democratic reforms.
    On this day, early in the morning, young Dai men and women went up the mountains in groups to pick simple and fragrant small flowers, and to the clear river to fetch water.
    Buddhists flocked to the more than 1,000 Buddhist temples in the Dai villages. In the square of each temple, there was a carved wooden dragon with a hollow abdomen, with six golden Buddha statues sitting at the front of the dragon's head. Believers knelt around the blue dragon, chanting scriptures, and then poured buckets of clear spring water into the dragon's abdomen, with many small water droplets spraying from the dragon's mouth, sprinkling on the Buddha statues.
    The sun was overhead, and the heat was rising from the plains. Groups of Dai youths, beating elephant-foot drums and cymbals, carrying flowers and spring water, flashed out from the banana and mango tree groves, and came to the village entrance and the shady paths. Everyone held a small cup of cool water, and, holding each other's collars, poured water down each other's necks, offering blessings.
    The Water-Splashing Festival is also a festival for sowing love. In the mutual splashing of water and blessings, young men and women all wanted to find a sincere heart that loved them. The elephant-foot drums and cymbals resounded passionately and rhythmically. Intimate young men and women chased each other under the banyan trees and by the streams, giggling and splashing, until they were all soaked like "drowned chickens," and the water-splashing continued enthusiastically.
    In the past, although the Water-Splashing Festival was a national festival for the Dai people, due to the cruel rule of feudal lords, the beautiful festival was accompanied by a shadow of pain. Especially for some farm girls, it often became a day of disaster. On this day, who knew which great lord and his sons would go to the countryside to "eat flower wine" (a privilege of the lords), and the most beautiful girl in the village would have to accompany him to bathe and eat. The great lords and his sons, drunk and in a stupor, would harass the girls at will. Afterwards, this unfortunate girl would lose the right to marry.
    After the democratic reforms, the feudal lords could no longer ride on the backs of the people, the shadow disappeared, and people's joy during the festival was indescribable. The sun set, and the sky twinkled with stars. Young men and women went out to play in groups again. In the quiet night sky, one could only hear the cheerful sanxian music, songs, and laughter of the young people from the depths of the dense forest.
    On Mount Nuo'aibang Cong
    On Mount Nuo'aibang Cong in the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture, there are two villages, both called Bangwan. One village is inhabited by Jingpo people; the other village is inhabited by Benglong people. The two villages are only half a li apart, but in the past, they never interacted like enemies. Now, they are as close as brothers.
    Originally, the village inhabited by the Jingpo people was where the Dai chieftain, more than 250 years ago, forced the Jingpo Shiban Mountain officials to come to collect the "Bao Tou Tax" (a donation tax levied by the Jingpo Mountain officials under the pretext of protecting the safety of the Benglong people's livestock). Forty-two years ago, the "Bao Tou Tax" paid by Tian Lao San's family, a Benglong person, did not meet the Shiban Mountain official's satisfaction. One day, Tian's three brothers were leading a large bull to reclaim wasteland on the hillside and were resting in a thatched shed next to the field at night. At dawn, a dozen Jingpo people, carrying long knives, rushed into the shed and started hacking with their knives. Tian Lao Da and Tian Lao Er fell. Tian Lao San escaped the encirclement. He squatted in the grass, watching the Jingpo people sent by the mountain officials lead away his family's big bull. Soon after, Tian Lao Da and Tian Lao Er both died. Since then, the hatred between the two villages has deepened.
    In 1956, democratic reforms were implemented in the Dai areas of Yunnan's frontier. Under the influence of the reforms, the "Bao Tou Tax" was gradually abolished. In the struggle, the people of both villages slowly realized that the past discord was caused by the Tusi and mountain officials. Last year, the People's Commune was established on Mount Nuo'aibang Cong. For the first time, the Benglong and Jingpo people worked in the same field and ate from the same pot. In production, people helped each other, learning from each other's strengths. The Benglong people were very taboo about killing livestock. To avoid killing pigs and chickens, they never raised hens and pigs, only roosters for crowing at dawn. The Jingpo people gave the Benglong people several sows and hens, helping them establish a pig farm. The friendship between the two ethnic groups is growing closer.
    One day, Tian Yan, the son of Tian Lao San, a Benglong person, and Li San, a Jingpo person, were cutting wood for the dam in the forest by the reservoir when they suddenly heard a noisy bird sound overhead. They looked up and saw a green poisonous snake, as thick as a wine glass, swallowing a small bird. Tian Yan immediately cut a bamboo pole and knocked the snake to the ground. He quickly raised his axe and chopped down on its head, but he missed. Unexpectedly, the snake suddenly wrapped itself around Tian Yan on the tree. Li San, a Jingpo person who was nearby, quickly ran over and chopped off the snake's head with one blow. The snake's tail swung back and hit Li San like an iron chain, causing him to stagger and hit a large tree. A large piece of skin was torn off his arm, and blood gushed out. Tian Yan quickly helped Li San to his home and asked his uncle to treat him.
    In the labor, these two ethnic groups, who have been living together for hundreds of years, discovered that they are all brave and kind brothers. (Text by Ye Zijian, Illustration by Miao Di) (with picture)

    欢乐的边疆
    今年的泼水节
    每年清明节后的第七天，就是傣族人民的泼水节。
    今年，德宏傣族景颇族自治州所有傣族人民公社和农业社都放了一天假。十七万多傣族农民欢度了民主改革后令人难忘的佳节。
    这一天清晨，傣族农家的少男少女们成群结伴地上山采摘素静清香的小花，到清澈的河边挑水。
    佛教徒们络绎不绝地来到傣族农村里一千多个佛寺前。每个佛寺的广场上，都摆着一条缕雕的心腹中空的木龙，龙头前端坐着六个金色的佛像。教徒们跪在青龙四周念经，然后把一桶桶清冽的泉水倾入木龙的心腹，龙嘴里喷出许多小水珠浇洒在佛像身上。
    太阳当顶了，平坝上热气蒸腾。一群群傣族青年们敲着象脚鼓和铓钹，挑起鲜花、泉水，从芭蕉、芒果树林里闪出来，来到村头和林荫小路上。大家都端一小杯青凉的水，彼此提着衣领从颈项里向下倾泼，互相祝福。
    泼水节也是播种爱情的节日。在相互泼水和祝福中，少男少女们都想寻找一颗诚挚的热爱自己的心。象脚鼓和铓钹热烈地有节奏地轰响起来了，知心的少男少女们在大榕树下、在小溪边互相追逐，他们嘻笑溅泼，都泼得像“落汤鸡”了，泼水还在热烈地进行。
    过去，尽管泼水节是傣族人民全民的节日，但由于封建领主的残酷统治，美好的节日是伴随着痛苦的阴影的。特别是对一些农家少女来说，往往就成为灾难的日子。这一天，说不定哪一个大领主和他的公子们下乡去“吃花酒”（这是领主的一种特权），全村最美丽的姑娘就得去陪他洗澡、吃饭。大领主和他的公子们喝得酩酊大醉了，对姑娘们任意取闹。以后，这不幸的少女就丧失了结婚的权利。
    民主改革以后，封建领主再也不能骑在人民头上了，阴影消失了，人们在节日的欢欣之情无以形容。太阳落山了，满天闪烁着繁星，少男少女们又一伙伙地到村外去游玩。在静静的夜空里，只听见密林深处青年们快活的三弦琴声、歌声和笑声。
    在诺爱邦賩山上
    在德宏傣族景颇族自治州的诺爱邦賩山上有两个村子，都叫邦宛。一个村子里住的是景颇人；一个寨子住着崩龙人。两村相距不过半里地，过去像冤家一样从不来往，现在好得像亲兄弟一样。
    原来，住景颇人的村子是傣族土司远在二百五十多年前迫令景颇人的石板山官派来代收“保头税”（景颇山官借口保护崩龙人畜安全收的一种捐税）的。四十二年前，崩龙人田老三家的“保头税”上得不合石板山官的心意。有一天，田家三个兄弟牵着一条大牯子牛在山坡上开荒，夜里就在地边的草棚里歇息。拂晓时，十几个景颇人提着长刀奔进草棚举刀就砍，田老大和田老二倒下了。田老三逃出了重围。他蹲在草稞里，眼看着山官派来的景颇人把他家的大牯子牛牵走了。不久以后，田老大和田老二都死了。从此，两寨人的仇恨结得更深了。
    1956年，云南边疆傣族地区实行了民主改革，“保头税”也在改革的影响下逐渐地被取消了。两村人民在斗争中慢慢地认识到过去的不和睦是土司和山官搞的鬼。去年，诺爱邦賩山上办了人民公社，崩龙人和景颇人头一次在一块田里劳动，吃一口锅里的饭。生产中，人们互相帮助，取长补短。崩龙人最忌杀牲，为了怕杀猪杀鸡，从来不养母鸡和猪，只养公鸡啼明。景颇人送给崩龙人几只母猪和母鸡，帮助他们建立了养猪场。两族人民的友谊日益亲密。
    有一天，崩龙人田老三的儿子田岩和景颇人李三在水库边的森林里砍伐水坝上的木料，忽然听到头顶上一阵鸟声聒噪，他们抬起头来，只见一条酒杯粗的青皮毒蛇正在吞食一只小鸟。田岩马上砍了一根竹竿，把这花蛇打下地来，他又迅速提起斧子朝它头上猛然一砍，可惜没有砍准，那家伙冷不防一下把田岩缠到树上了。在附近的景颇人李三，赶忙跑拢来一刀把蛇头砍掉了，这蛇的尾巴却又甩过去，像条铁索似地把李三打了一个踉跄，撞在一棵大树上，手臂上掉了一大块皮，鲜血直冒。田岩忙把李三扶到家里，请叔叔给治好了。
    劳动中这两个相处了几百年的民族发现彼此都是勇敢而善良的兄弟。（叶子键文，苗地插图）（附图片）
