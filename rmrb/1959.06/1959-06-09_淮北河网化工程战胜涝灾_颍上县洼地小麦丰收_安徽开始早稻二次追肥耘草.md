Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 7th June: Anhui Province's 8,810,000 mu of early rice are a lush green, growing well. Some are regreening and sprouting, while others have already closed ranks. Various localities are stepping up topdressing, weeding, and drying the fields according to the different growth stages of the rice seedlings. According to statistics from June 2nd, over 95% of the province's early rice has undergone topdressing and weeding.

In Anhui Province, early rice transplanting concluded in the early and middle of May. Various localities followed up with timely checking and replanting of seedlings, topdressing, and weeding. In the Anqing Special District, 2,700,000 mu of early rice have all been checked and replanted, with 2,500,000 mu weeded and 2,230,000 mu topdressed. In the Wuhu Special District, 270,000 people are participating in field management daily to effectively manage early rice, aiming to transform third-class seedlings during the seedling stage. As of the 2nd, the entire district had topdressed and weeded 3,000,000 mu. This special district also universally implemented a responsibility system where field management is contracted to households, measures are implemented in the fields, responsibility is assigned to individuals, and inspections and evaluations are conducted with marked acceptances. In the process of topdressing and weeding, various localities have rationally applied fertilizer based on different conditions such as soil, base fertilizer, variety, and seedling conditions.

Currently, on the basis of the achievements made in the first stage, various localities in Anhui Province are accelerating the second round of topdressing and weeding. Qingyang County, in organizing the second topdressing and weeding, first criticized the complacent and paralyzed thinking of "ending the first weeding and waiting for the harvest" and "early rice grows well, so it doesn't need much management." They comprehensively carried out evaluations and inspections, setting off a high tide of field management.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei: Nearly 300,000 mu of wheat in the lake and depression areas of Yingshang County, Anhui, have all been harvested. From the communes where threshing has been completed, good news of transforming low yields into high yields is constantly pouring in. In Yanghu Commune, the 10,075 mu of low-lying wheat that has been harvested yielded an average of 375 jin per mu, more than double last year's per-mu yield. In Chuigang Township, 10,000 mu of low-lying wheat suffered yield reductions due to waterlogging in 1952, 1954, and 1956, with a maximum yield of only 30-40 jin per mu. This year, thanks to the river network project overcoming the flood disaster, the average yield was 320 jin per mu. The peasants happily said, "Harvesting one mu of bay (i.e., lake and depression land) is better than two or three mu on the high ground." Old farmer Wang Wentian said, "This year, there was a lot of continuous rain. If it weren't for the river network, the low-lying areas would have been navigable by boat, how could we have had such a good harvest?"

Yingshang County is located at the confluence of the Huai River and its tributary, the Ying River. There are a total of 72 large and small lakes and depressions within its borders, with the cultivated area of the lake and depression lands accounting for about one-third of the county's total cultivated area. The soil is fertile. However, due to the low-lying terrain of the lake and depression areas, rainfall is concentrated every spring and summer, and they are often flooded, resulting in low wheat yields. In order to overcome the flood disaster and transform the low-yielding lake and depression areas into high-yielding areas, the Yingshang County Committee of the Communist Party of China, after investigation and research, formulated a comprehensive flood control and yield protection plan centered on the construction of river network projects. According to this plan, since the winter of 1957, a cumulative total of over 178.8 million cubic meters of earth and stone work has been completed, basically forming a complete water conservancy system where rivers are connected to rivers and ditches and ponds are linked. This year, from January to the end of May, the rainfall in Yingshang County was greater and more concentrated than in previous years. According to statistics from May 2nd to 9th, the county's rainfall reached more than 140 millimeters, exceeding the rainfall in any previous year during the same period. However, thanks to the river network storing over 140 million cubic meters of water in a timely manner, the accumulation of water in the depressions was effectively reduced, ensuring a bumper harvest of wheat in the depressions.

    淮北河网化工程战胜涝灾
    颍上县洼地小麦丰收
    安徽开始早稻二次追肥耘草
    据新华社合肥7日电　安徽省八百八十一万亩早稻一片碧绿，生长良好，有的返青发棵，有的已经封行，各地正根据禾苗生长不同情况，加紧追肥、耘草、烤田。据6月2日统计，全省95％以上的早稻已经过追肥、耘草。
    安徽省在5月上、中旬早稻插秧即结束，各地随着及时查苗补棵、追肥、耘草。安庆专区二百七十万亩早稻全部进行了查苗补棵，并且耘草二百五十万亩，追肥二百二十三万亩。芜湖专区为切实管好早稻，每天参加田间管理的达二十七万人，他们要在早稻苗期就改变三类苗。截至2日止，全区已追肥、耘草三百万亩。这个专区还普遍推行了田间管理包到户，措施到田，责任到人，检查评比，插标验收的责任制度。各地在追肥、耘草过程中，都根据土壤、底肥、品种、秧棵等不同情况合理追肥。
    现在，安徽省各地在取得第一阶段成绩的基础上，正加速进行第二次追肥、耘草。青阳县在组织第二次追肥、耘草中，首先批判了“结束头交草（即第一次耘田结束），安心等收成”和“早稻长得好，用不着多管理”的松劲麻痹思想，全面开展了评比检查，掀起了田间管理高潮。
    据新华社合肥电　安徽颍上县湖洼地区的近三十万亩小麦已经全部割完。脱粒工作已经结束的公社，不断传出低产变高产的喜讯。杨湖公社已经收打完毕的一万零七十五亩洼地小麦，平均每亩实收三百七十五斤，比去年亩产量增加了一倍以上。垂岗乡一万亩洼地小麦，在1952年、1954年、1956年都因受涝减产，亩产最多三、四十斤。今年由于利用河网化工程战胜了涝灾，平均每亩实收三百二十斤。农民们高兴地说：“收了一亩湾（即湖洼地），胜似岗上二亩三。”老农王文田说：“今年连阴雨多，要是没有河网化，洼地早就行船了，那有这样好的收成。”
    颍上县位于淮河和淮河支流颍河的汇流处，境内共有大小湖洼七十二处，湖洼地的耕地面积约占全县总耕地面积的三分之一，土质肥沃。但是，由于湖洼地区地势低下，每年春夏雨量集中，经常受涝成灾，小麦产量很低。为了战胜涝灾，使湖洼低产地区，变为高产地区，中共颍上县委经过调查研究，制订了兴修河网化工程为中心的全面治涝保收规划方案。根据这个方案，从1957年冬季以来，累计完成土石方一亿七千八百多万公方，已经基本上形成了河河相通、沟塘相联的完整的水利体系。今年颍上县从1月到5月底的降雨量比往年大，而且比较集中，据5月2日到9日统计，全县降雨量达一百四十多公厘，超过以往任何一年同期降雨量。但是，由于河网及时蓄水一亿四千多万立方，有效地减少了洼地积水量，保证洼地小麦获得了大丰收。
