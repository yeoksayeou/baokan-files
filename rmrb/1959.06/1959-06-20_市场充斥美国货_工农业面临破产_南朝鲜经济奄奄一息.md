Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 18th. Our correspondent reports: American economic "aid" to South Korea has comprehensively destroyed South Korea's industrial and agricultural production, turning the South Korean economy into a colonial economy completely dependent on the United States and serving American war policies.

According to statistics from American newspapers, in the past nine years, the United States has given South Korea 2.5 billion US dollars in economic "aid," but the vast majority of this is surplus American commodities. The South Korean News Agency said that in the past thirteen years, the value of surplus commodities sent by the United States accounted for 76.7% of the total amount of American economic "aid"; this year, the value of surplus commodities even accounted for 84% of the 225 million US dollars of American "aid." After the Rhee Syngman clique dumped these surplus materials on the South Korean market, it used all the proceeds to expand its military and prepare for war.

As a result of the United States dumping its surplus commodities in South Korea in large quantities, South Korea's national industry has been devastated and is on its last legs. At present, South Korea's total industrial output value has dropped to half of what it was at the end of Japanese rule.

According to statistics, last year, 87% of the industrial products needed by South Korea came from the United States, and all of its steel, machine tools, petroleum, chemical fertilizers, and other heavy industrial products had to be imported from the United States. Under these circumstances, South Korea's only iron-smelting plant, the Samhwa Iron Works, has long been shut down. South Korea's only steel plant, the Incheon Steel Plant, is in a state of constant shutdown because the price of its steel is half as expensive as the steel dumped by the United States, and its products cannot be sold. This year, South Korea only needs 400,000 tons of cement, but there are currently as many as 610,000 tons of American cement flooding the South Korean market, putting South Korea's cement plants in danger of bankruptcy.

The disaster of the American commodity flood is simply all-pervasive. Not long ago, small businesses and handicraftsmen in South Korea protested against the United States' massive dumping of commodities such as razors, fishing nets, and planes in South Korea, which robbed them of their business.

According to South Korean newspapers, the United States has dumped more than 30 million "seok" (one "seok" equals 150 kilograms) of grain to South Korea in the past fourteen years, reaching 5.24 million "seok" last year alone. At present, 23 "jin" (one "jin" equals 0.5 kilograms) of every 100 "jin" of grain consumed by the South Korean people comes from the United States. The large-scale dumping of American surplus agricultural products has dealt a fatal blow to South Korean agriculture, turning South Korean rural areas from a "granary" into a "land of hunger."

This year, the United States insisted on dumping 5 million US dollars worth of tobacco to South Korea. South Korea's "Industrial Economic News" published an editorial in May saying that South Korea had already accumulated enough tobacco for two years of use. If American tobacco is imported again, South Korea's domestic tobacco will be squeezed out of existence.

In 1949, South Korea produced 139 million "jin" of cotton, but at present, American cotton has almost completely occupied the South Korean cotton market. Last year, South Korean farmers sold less than 100,000 "jin" of cotton to the market.

### 市场充斥美国货　工农业面临破产  南朝鲜经济奄奄一息

    市场充斥美国货　工农业面临破产
    南朝鲜经济奄奄一息
    新华社平壤18日电　本社记者报道：美国对南朝鲜的经济“援助”全面摧毁了南朝鲜的工农业生产，使南朝鲜经济变成完全依赖美国和为美国的战争政策服务的殖民地经济。
    据美国报刊的统计，在过去九年中，美国给了南朝鲜二十五亿美元的经济“援助”，但是，其中绝大部分是美国的剩余商品。南朝鲜通讯社说，十三年来，美国送来的剩余商品的价值在美国经济“援助”总额中占了76.7％；今年，剩余商品的价值竟占美国“援助”的二亿二千五百多万美元中的84％。美李集团把这些剩余物资在南朝鲜市场上倾销以后，把所得款项全部用于扩军备战。
    美国在南朝鲜大量倾销它的剩余商品的结果，把南朝鲜的民族工业摧残得奄奄一息。目前，南朝鲜的工业总产值已经降低到日本统治末期的一半。
    据统计，去年，南朝鲜需要的工业制品中的87％来自美国，而它所需要的全部钢材、工作母机、石油、化学肥料等重工业产品都要从美国进口。在这种情况下，南朝鲜唯一的炼铁厂——三和制铁所早已停工；南朝鲜唯一的炼钢厂——仁川钢厂由于它所生产的钢的价格比美国倾销的钢的价格贵一半，产品卖不出去，目前已经陷于不时停工的状态。今年，南朝鲜只需要四十万吨水泥，可是目前充斥在南朝鲜市场上的美国水泥竟达六十一万吨之多，这种情况使得南朝鲜的水泥厂面临破产的危机。
    美国商品泛滥之灾简直无孔不入。不久以前，南朝鲜的小企业和手工业者曾经抗议美国向南朝鲜大量倾销刮脸刀、渔网、刨子等商品，从而抢走了他们的生意。
    据南朝鲜报刊统计，十四年来，美国向南朝鲜倾销了三千多万石（每石合一百五十公斤）粮食，去年一年就达到五百二十四万石。目前，南朝鲜人民食用的每一百斤粮食中，就有二十三斤来自美国。美国剩余农产品的大量倾销给了南朝鲜农业以致命的打击，使南朝鲜农村由“谷仓”变成了“饥饿之乡”。
    今年，美国硬要向南朝鲜倾销价值五百万美元的烟草，南朝鲜的“产业经济新闻”曾经在5月间发表社论说，南朝鲜已经积压了足够两年之用的烟草，如果再进口美国烟草，南朝鲜的国产烟草将被排挤得“无影无踪”。
    1949年，南朝鲜曾经生产过一亿三千九百万斤棉花，可是，目前美棉已经几乎全部占领了南朝鲜的棉花市场。去年，南朝鲜农民卖到市场上去的棉花还不到十万斤。
