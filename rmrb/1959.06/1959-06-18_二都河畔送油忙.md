    Busy Delivering Oil on the Banks of the Erdu River
    By Our Correspondent Jiang Dongguang
    June 4th was the first sunny day after a long spell of rain, and the sky was clear. The members of the Shuidong People's Commune in Xupu County, Hunan Province, having achieved a large-scale rapeseed harvest, were carrying golden buckets of oil, in groups and lines, from the foothills and along the streams, continuously heading towards the oil procurement station along the banks of the Erdu River. The air was filled with the joy and laughter of a bountiful harvest. As they walked, people sang local mountain songs: "Green hills and clear waters, rice paddies abundant, busy delivering oil on the banks of the Erdu River, good oil sent to the procurement station, supporting the cities and factories."
    At the oil procurement station, the courtyard was filled with the aroma of oil. The staff were busy weighing the oil and issuing payment slips. In the evening, the bustling crowd of oil deliverers returned home. After closing the books, the procurement station found that it had purchased 8,067.625 kilograms of rapeseed oil that day. The Lvhua (Greening) Brigade is one of the leading rapeseed high-yield brigades in Xupu County. The brigade's 23.56 hectares of rapeseed fields yielded a total of 26,408.9 kilograms of dry rapeseed, averaging 606.75 kilograms per hectare, an increase of 36% compared to last year's 550 kilograms per hectare. The bumper harvest brought unspeakable joy to the people. Seizing the sunny weather, they mobilized 1,066 people to harvest the ripe rapeseed in one day. Immediately afterwards, they organized the members to take advantage of the sunny weather to dry and clean the rapeseed, and fixed the oil pressing workers to start pressing. After starting the pressing, the brigade's Party general branch decided to press and deliver simultaneously, handing over the good oil to the state.
    On the evening of the 25th, the Party general branch held a meeting of members' representatives to specifically discuss the matter of selling good oil to the state. The members' representatives said one after another: "When drinking water, we must not forget the well-diggers, and when we have a good harvest, we must not forget the Communist Party! We must first complete the state's procurement tasks." According to everyone's opinions, the general branch decided to have Deputy Secretary Zhang Liangzhao take charge of this matter, arranged the labor force, and sent twenty shock team members early every morning to send the dried rapeseed to the oil mill, and incidentally bring the oil cake back to the production teams as fertilizer, pressing and delivering oil to the warehouse simultaneously.
    In the brigade's oil mill, Zhang Liangzhao was discussing with the workers the issue of increasing the oil extraction rate. This oil mill has already increased its oil extraction rate from 28 kilograms per 100 kilograms of rapeseed last year to 33 kilograms. Now Zhang Liangzhao and the workers have calculated that if they change the single pressing to intermediate pressing, they can extract five or six kilograms more oil per 100 kilograms of rapeseed. This is indeed an invisible wealth! Afterwards, he went to discuss the pressing changes with the pressing woodworkers.
    Since the beginning of pressing, this brigade has delivered more than 1,000 kilograms of oil to the state in just ten days, exchanging it for more than 1,000 yuan in RMB.

    二都河畔送油忙
    本报记者  姜东光
    6月4日，久雨初晴，晴空万里。获得油菜大面积丰收以后的湖南省溆浦县水东公社的社员们，一路路、一行行担着金黄色的油桶，从山脚下的大路上，小溪旁，络绎不绝地沿着二都河畔向着油脂收购站走去。这里到处洋溢着丰收后的喜悦和欢笑，人们一边走一边唱着本地的山歌：“青山绿水禾封行，二都河畔送油忙，好油送给收购站，支援城市与工矿。”
    在油脂收购站里，满院油香。收购站的工作人员一边忙着过秤，一边又忙着开付款单。傍晚，熙熙攘攘送油的人们都回去了。收购站一结账，这一天就收购菜油八千零六十七斤十两。绿化大队是溆浦县数一数二的油菜丰产大队。全队三百五十三亩四分五油菜，共收干菜籽五万二千八百十七斤十五两，平均亩产一百四十九斤七两，比去年亩产一百一十斤增产36％。丰收给人们带来了说不尽的喜悦。他们抓住晴天，曾出动一千零六十六人在一天之内就把黄熟的油菜籽收割回家。紧接着，他们又组织社员趁着晴天把菜籽晒干车净，固定榨工开了榨；开榨以后，大队党总支决定边榨边送，把好油交售给国家。
    25日晚上，党总支召开了一次社员代表会，具体讨论了出售好油给国家的事。社员代表们纷纷表示：“吃水不能忘了挖井人，丰收不能忘了共产党！一定要先完成国家的征购任务。”总支按照大家的意见，决定由副书记张良兆专管这件事，把劳动力作了安排，每天清早派二十名突击队员把晒干的菜籽送到油坊，顺便又把枯饼带回各生产队作肥料，边榨边送油入库。
    在大队的油坊里，张良兆在和工人们商量提高出油率问题。这个油坊已由去年每百斤菜籽出油二十八斤提高到三十三斤，现在张良兆和工人们算了一笔账：只要把一头压榨改为中间压榨，每百斤菜籽多出五、六斤油没有问题。这确是一笔看不见的财富！随后他就去找榨木工商量改榨的事情去了。
    这个大队从开榨起，只十天时间，就已经交售给国家二千一百多斤油，换回了人民币一千多元。
