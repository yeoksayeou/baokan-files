Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 8th: Lao news: "The Xieng Khouang Lao Patriots News" published on June 5th letters from the former Lao Fighting Forces Second Battalion to the Lao people and the Lao Royal Army respectively.

The newspaper is the organ of the former Lao Fighting Forces Second Battalion, and the June 5th issue is its inaugural issue.

In the letter to the Royal Army, the former Lao Fighting Forces Second Battalion said, "Because we have a keen desire for independence, democracy, and national harmony, we once came from the provinces of Phongsaly and Sam Neua to cooperate with the Royal Government. However, the US imperialists and the Phoui Sananikone government were unwilling to do so. They tried every possible means to undermine our national harmony and brutally suppress patriots. Under the pretext of granting military ranks, they attempted to disarm us. Therefore, we had to withdraw from the Plain of Jars to avoid conflict. However, they mobilized troops, blocked us in front and pursued us from behind, attacking us in an attempt to eliminate us. They once wrote to us saying they wanted to hold negotiations with us, but they still opened fire on us. We will never be deceived by them and are determined to persist in the struggle here."

The letter hopes that "Lao people will not fight Lao people, and tells the Royal Army not to suppress the people, and not to arrest and kill patriots, otherwise, the Second Battalion will be forced to fight resolutely to defend ourselves and defend the people."

In the letter to the Lao people, the Second Battalion also talked about why they had to withdraw from the Plain of Jars. The letter said: "We are determined to persist in self-defense combat here to protect the lives and property of the people. We demand that the Lao Royal Government strictly implement the Geneva Accords and the relevant agreements signed in Vientiane (between the Lao Royal Government and the former Lao Fighting Forces) to realize national harmony and national unity, stop the civil war, and lead Laos to the path of peace, neutrality, and national independence."

    前寮国战斗部队第二营写信给老挝人民和王国军队
    坚决战斗　保卫自己　保卫人民
    新华社河内8日电　老挝消息：“川圹老挝爱国者消息报”6月5日发表了前寮国战斗部队第二营分别写给老挝人民和老挝王国军队的信。
    这家报纸是前寮国战斗部队第二营的机关报，6月5日的一期是它的创刊号。
    前寮国战斗部队第二营在给王国军队的信中说，“我们因为对独立、民主和民族和睦怀有热切的愿望，所以我们曾经从丰沙里和桑怒两省出来同王国政府方面合作。但是美帝国主义和培·萨纳尼空政府不愿意这样做，他们千方百计破坏我们民族的和睦，残暴地镇压爱国者。他们假借授军衔的名义企图解除我们的武装，因此，我们不得不撤出镇宁平原以免发生冲突。但是，他们调兵遣将，前堵后追，向我们进攻，企图消灭我们。他们曾经写信给我们说要同我们举行谈判，但却仍然向我们开枪。我们决不受他们的欺骗，决心在这里坚持斗争。”
    信中希望“老挝人不要打老挝人，并告诉王国军队不要镇压人民，不要逮捕和杀害爱国者，不然，第二营就要被迫坚决战斗以保卫自己和保卫人民”。
    第二营在写给老挝人民的信中也谈到为什么他们要撤出镇宁平原。信中说：“我们坚决在这里坚持自卫战斗，保卫人民的生命财产。我们要求老挝王国政府方面严格履行日内瓦协议和（老挝王国政府和前寮国战斗部队）在万象签订的有关协议，实现民族的和睦和国家的统一，停止内战，把老挝引向和平、中立和民族独立的道路”。
