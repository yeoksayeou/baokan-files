Middle School Students, How to Choose?
Xue Ya

Different thoughts determine different aspirations. A good aspiration must be the result of a correct choice.

In the old society, many middle school graduates applied to normal schools; in the new society, even more people are applying to normal schools. Superficially, both chose the career of a teacher, but their ideological situations are very different. In the old society, some middle school students, because of poor family circumstances and inability to afford university, applied to normal schools to find a job to make a living in the future. In that society of class oppression, the problem of eating ruined the precious youth of many young people and buried the talents of many promising young people! Middle school students in the new society, when applying to normal schools, have a far-reaching ideal, just like when applying to other schools. They want to transform the country of six hundred million people, which is both poor and blank, into a country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture. They have neither the pain of being unable to attend school nor the threat of unemployment, like free angels, free to soar in the free and vast sky of the motherland, flying as high as they want. They do not know what "compelled" means; they wholeheartedly yearn for a bright future and strive to exert their greatest talents.

However, there are still a very small number of middle school students whose views on applying to normal schools are influenced by the views of the old society. Some middle school graduates say, I want to apply to engineering and science, study cutting-edge science, and make a name for myself in the world in the future. Some see that some classmates have applied to normal schools and think that they dare not strive to be the best, dare not devote themselves to vigorous careers, but are content to be in the middle, planning to live a mediocre life quietly and coldly. Is this really the case?

Please see, in that society of class oppression, people were forced to sell their labor but could not, so where was there any room for choice? Millions more were ill-clad, ill-fed, displaced, and struggling on the brink of death! In our new society, the situation is completely different. We are now building socialism, and in the future, we will transition to communism. Cultivating new communist people is an inseparable part of realizing the great ideal of communism, and the vast number of outstanding young people are stepping into the ranks of teachers who are both red and expert. This is not an unambitious job, but a noble and glorious cause. The Party and the state pay attention to the work of teachers at all times and in all places, helping teachers to improve and improve again. Under the clear sky of the motherland, middle school students have forever thrown off the pain of "being unable to attend school" and "unemployment," and have forever broken free from the chains of "having no livelihood" and "a bleak future." You should fly like free birds, unconstrained, but some of you are tripped by invisible ropes, unable to fly, unable to fly high. This is something to be vigilant about!

Choosing solely for personal purposes cannot be a correct choice; aspirations that start from the individual are also difficult to achieve. People with individualistic ideas, even if they choose engineering, science, or any other specialty, will hardly have good results. Obviously, in the new society, individualism runs into walls everywhere, and this kind of person is looked down upon. Isn't the idea of circling in one's own small world too far removed from the ideal of young people in the new China contributing all their talents for the bright and splendid future of the motherland?

When you are about to apply to a new school and are faced with the question of choosing an aspiration, middle school students, please choose!

### 中学生们，怎样选择？

    中学生们，怎样选择？
    薛雅
    不同的思想，决定不同的志愿。好的志愿，一定是经过了正确的选择。
    在旧社会里，许多中学毕业生报考了师范学校；在新社会里，有更多的人报考师范学校。从表面上看，都是选择了教师的志愿，可是他们的思想情况是大不相同的。在旧社会里，有些中学生因为家境不好，上不起大学，才考了师范学校，将来好找个糊口的工作。在那阶级压迫的社会里，为了吃饭问题，真不知道断送了多少青年的宝贵青春，埋没了多少有才能的青年！新社会的中学生，报考师范学校，就像报考其他学校一样，有一个远大的理想。他们要把六亿人口的又穷又白的国家，变成一个有现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化的国家。他们既没有失学的痛苦，也没有失业的威胁，就像自由的天使一样，可以在祖国的自由广阔的天空下，任意翱翔，要飞多高就飞多高。他们不知道“迫不得已”为何物，他们一心向往着美好的未来，尽力发挥自己最大的才智。
    可是，中学生中间也还有极少数人，对报考师范学校的看法，受着旧社会的那种看法的影响。有些中学毕业生说，我要报考工科、理科，学尖端科学，将来扬名世界。有的看到有些同学报考了师范学校，就认为是不敢争取上游，不敢投身于轰轰烈烈的事业，而是甘居中游，打算冷冷清清地平庸地活一辈子。事实真是这样吗？
    请看，在那阶级压迫的社会里，人们被迫出卖自己的劳动力而不可得，哪有什么选择的余地呢？更有千百万人衣不蔽体，食不果腹，流离失所，挣扎在死亡线上！在我们新社会里，情况完全两样。现在正在建设社会主义，将来还要过渡到共产主义去。培养共产主义新人，是实现共产主义伟大理想不可分割的一部分，广大优秀的青年，正踏进又红又专教师的行列。这不是没出息的工作，而是崇高、光荣的事业。党和国家随时随地关注教师工作，帮助教师提高、再提高。在祖国晴朗的天空下，中学生们永远抛掉了“失学”、“失业”的痛苦，永远挣脱了“生活无着”、“前途暗淡”的锁链，你们应当像自由的小鸟，无拘无束地飞翔，可是，你们中间的那些人却让那看不见的绳索绊住了脚，飞不起来，飞不高，这真要警惕啊！
    单纯为了个人的目的而选择，不可能是正确的选择；从个人出发的志愿，也是难能达到的。有了个人主义思想的人，即使选择了工科、理科，或其他什么专科，都难能有好的结果。很显然，在新社会里，个人主义到处碰壁，这种人才叫人看不起呢。从个人的小天地里打圈子的想法，同新中国青年为了祖国光明灿烂的未来而贡献一切才智的理想，不是相距太远了吗？
    当你们要报考新的学校的时候，面临着选择志愿这个问题，中学生们，请你们选择吧！
