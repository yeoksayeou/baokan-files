What Are the Americans Doing in South Korea?
By our correspondent Wang Yuzhang

The Korean War has been over for six years, and the Chinese People's Volunteers completely withdrew from Korea last year. However, the American aggressor troops who launched the war of aggression against Korea are still occupying South Korea and refuse to leave. What are they doing there?

Continuing to engage in murderous activities

Although the Korean War has stopped, the American troops remaining in South Korea are still engaged in murderous activities. On the one hand, they are frantically preparing for large-scale killings, violating the Korean Armistice Agreement, expanding the Rhee pseudo-army from sixteen divisions to thirty-one divisions, and transporting atomic weapons and missile weapons into South Korea, turning South Korea into a nuclear war base, plotting to launch a new war. On the other hand, they also treat the South Korean people as live targets, shooting and killing them at will.

According to incomplete materials disclosed by South Korean newspapers and periodicals in the first five months of this year alone, American troops have shot and wounded eighteen South Korean people. On March 28, a Korean boy was shot and killed by American Private First Class James near Gimpo Airport with a shotgun. On January 29, an American soldier in Pyeongtaek County stabbed a Korean woman, Kim Guk-ja, to death with a bayonet in order to snatch the gold ring from her hand.

The atrocities of the American troops in massacring the South Korean people are countless. On May 17, 1957, American Army Sergeant Thomas and another soldier attempted to rape two Korean women, Bian Jinshun and another, but failed. They pushed Bian Jinshun off a forty-meter-high cliff, killing her instantly. American troops have also repeatedly shot and killed women and children, shamelessly saying that they thought they were "pheasants." A South Korean newspaper cartoon depicts that South Korean people, regardless of men, women, old or young, have become "pheasants" or shooting targets in the eyes of the American troops. American troops also set military dogs to bite people, nailed teenagers into wooden boxes, and threw people from speeding cars. All kinds of atrocities are outrageous.

In addition, the shells, mines and other explosives that the American troops placed and abandoned everywhere in South Korea have killed and injured 6,773 South Korean people from 1953 to October last year. The planes that crashed and the stray bullets during the American military exercises also killed and injured people from time to time.

American troops also openly robbed in South Korea. On April 16, 1957, eighty military policemen from the American 24th Division looted 305 Korean residents in Paju County, robbing 2,324 items worth 3.5 million South Korean hwan. On May 31 this year, American soldiers Thomas and three others disguised themselves as passengers and robbed a car in Yeongdeungpo. They stabbed the driver with a knife and then robbed him of his money.

In the name of aid, but in reality invasion

In the past thirteen years, the United States has given South Korea approximately $2.4 billion in economic aid, but the result has been to create a living hell in South Korea, which has led even American journalists to ask: "Where did the money go?"

A look at the content of the American "aid" can answer this question. According to statistics from the South Korean News Agency, 76.7% of the $2.4 billion was surplus American goods. The proportion of surplus goods in this year's $225 million American "aid" reached 84%.

As a result of this tidal wave of dumping of American surplus goods, South Korea's national industry and agricultural production have been devastated. In the process of accepting this $2.4 billion, South Korea's industrial output value has decreased by half compared with the Japanese colonial period, and grain output has decreased by one-third. The direct effect of American "aid" is to turn South Korea into a market for American surplus goods, making South Korea's economy subordinate to the American economy and serving the American war policy.

For example, South Korea has its own steel industry, but the steel produced is more expensive than the American steel that is dumped, so the only Samhwa Ironworks closed down, and the production of the Incheon Steel Plant is also intermittent. As a result, South Korea has to rely 100% on the United States for the steel and machinery it needs.

South Korea has its own cement plants, but this year South Korea only needs 400,000 tons of cement, while 610,000 tons of American cement have flooded in, so South Korea's cement plants have to "face bankruptcy." South Korea has a chemical industry, but under the impact of the colorful American nylon and plastics, even silk weaving factories have recently closed down one after another. As for South Korea's "Dongyang Chemical Factory," it has to become a "park for deer, rabbits, and squirrels."

South Korea's textile industry has developed somewhat after the war, which is due to the fact that the United States needs to sell surplus cotton. Now South Korea's textile industry uses 100% American cotton. As a result, South Korea, which was originally rich in cotton, only had 100,000 catties of cotton on the market last year, while in 1949 it produced more than 139 million catties of cotton. Moreover, in recent years, the textile industry has only been operating at one-third capacity due to poor sales.

Like the production of cotton, South Korea, which was originally known as a granary and whose agricultural production accounted for a major position, has become a market for American "surplus" agricultural products and has become a "land of starvation."

For fourteen years, the United States has sold about 30 million seok (150 kg per seok) of grain to South Korea, making it impossible for South Korean farmers to sell the grain they produce at cost, and the planting area has been reduced by 600,000 jeongbo. Last year, 23 catties of American grain were used for every 100 catties of grain used in South Korea, while in the past South Korea exported millions of seok of grain every year.

The sugar-coated bullet of American "aid" has long since melted away the sugar coating and is exploding greatly and especially deeply in the depths of the South Korean national economy. This year, despite the fact that South Korea has accumulated enough tobacco for two years of consumption, the United States insisted on selling South Korea $5 million worth of tobacco. The South Korean "Industrial Economic News" recently published an editorial saying: This will be a "fatal blow to the South Korean tobacco cultivation industry" and will make "domestic tobacco disappear completely." Not long ago, some small business owners and craftsmen in South Korea protested against the dumping of razors, fishing nets, and auto parts by the United States, because American goods were taking their business.

This deceptive trick of the United States, which is ostensibly "aid" but actually invasion, has been seen through by the South Korean people.

Corroded by the American way of life

The American way of life is like a poisonous snake, burrowing into the minds and souls of the South Korean people, especially the youth.

American movies, which are the most vigorous in promoting the American way of life, have been rampant in South Korea for more than a decade. Opening up the South Korean newspapers in May this year, Seoul is showing American horror and erotic films such as "Valley of Bloodshed," "Streets of Terror," and "Secrets of the Kingdom of Inca."

The bad influence of these films can be seen from one example. The number of juvenile delinquents in South Korea is increasing year by year. Last year alone, there were 18,690 juvenile delinquents. They imitated the scenes in American movies, organized violent groups such as "Skull Gang" and "Lion Gang," attacked cars on the streets, robbed with guns, and lured girls.

Under the influence of American movies, South Korean films have also become imitations of American movies. This year, 90% of the films that have been made and are planned to be made in South Korea are promoting war, pornography, and nihilistic poison. In the recently made "Chunhyangjeon," the male protagonist, Lee Mong-ryong, became a standard American-style gangster with a pistol in his hand and wearing black glasses, and Chunhyang became a "femme fatale." South Korean newspapers also sighed: "This is an intolerable insult to national classical art." But Syngman Rhee greatly appreciated these. Not long ago, after he watched a South Korean erotic film "Because I Love Him," he shamelessly instructed the "Ministry of Education" to give it an award.

The South Korean literary front has also been occupied by American works that promote war, pornography, and decadence. Most of the literary works that won the "Liberty Literary Award" from the Syngman Rhee group not long ago are war literature, which greatly incites hatred between people. A South Korean reactionary poet, Yu Chi-hwan, wrote in one of his poems: "Ah! It is really lonely, lonely, empty, empty, even if there is something it is boring, I lie down again, lie down again, adding tens of thousands of zeros to zero."

### 美国人留在南朝鲜干什么？

    美国人留在南朝鲜干什么？
    本报记者　王玉章
    朝鲜战争停止已有六年了，中国人民志愿军已在去年全部撤出了朝鲜，但发动侵朝战争的美国侵略军队还霸占着南朝鲜，赖着不走，他们在那里干些什么呢？
    继续干着杀人的勾当
    朝鲜的战争虽然停止了，但留在南朝鲜的美军仍在干着杀人的勾当。他们一方面疯狂地准备大规模杀人，破坏朝鲜停战协定，把李伪军由十六个师扩大到三十一个师，把原子武器、导弹武器运进南朝鲜，把南朝鲜变成原子战争基地，阴谋发动新战争。另外，他们还把南朝鲜人民当作活靶子，任意开枪打死他们。
    今年头五个月仅据记者看到的南朝鲜报刊透露出来的不完全的材料，美军已打死打伤了十八名南朝鲜人民。3月28日一个朝鲜少年在金浦机场附近被美军一等兵杰姆斯用猎枪打死了。1月29日，一美军士兵在平泽郡为了抢夺朝鲜妇女金菊子手上的金戒指就用刺刀把她刺死。
    美军屠杀南朝鲜人民的兽行是不胜枚举的。1957年5月17日美军十七团下士托马斯等二人企图强奸边金顺等两个朝鲜妇女未遂，就把边金顺从四十公尺高的悬崖上推下去，活活摔死。美军还多次在开枪打死妇女和儿童以后，无耻地说以为他们是“野鸡”。南朝鲜报纸的漫画中描写，南朝鲜人民无论男女老幼到了美军的眼中都变成了“野鸡”或枪靶子。美军还放军犬咬人，将少年钉入木箱，把人从急驶着的车上抛下来，种种暴行令人发指。
    另外，美军在南朝鲜到处放置和抛弃的炮弹、地雷等爆炸物，从1953年到去年10月为止，就炸死炸伤南朝鲜人民六千七百七十三名。美军军事演习时飞机坠落，弹炮乱飞，也时时杀伤人命。
    美军在南朝鲜还公然行劫。1957年4月16日美军二十四师的八十名宪兵洗劫了坡州郡三百零五家朝鲜居民，抢走了价值南朝鲜币三百五十万圜的二千三百二十四件财物。今年5月31日美军士兵托马斯等四人化装为乘客，在永登浦拦劫了一辆小汽车，他们用刀刺伤司机，然后把他身上的钱劫走。
    援助为名侵略其实
    在过去的十三年中美国给了南朝鲜大约二十四亿美元的经济援助，但结果却是把南朝鲜造成了一座人间地狱，这使得连美国记者也发问：“钱到哪里去了呢？”
    只要看看美“援”的内容就可以解答这个问题了。据南朝鲜通讯社的统计，二十四亿美元中有76.7％是美国剩余商品，今年的二亿二千五百万美元的美“援”中剩余商品的比例竟达到84％。
    这样潮水般的美国剩余商品倾销的结果，冲垮了南朝鲜的民族工业和农业生产，南朝鲜在接受这二十四亿美元的过程中，工业产值比日本统治时期减少了一半，粮食产量减少了三分之一。美“援”的直接效果就是把南朝鲜变成了美国剩余商品的市场，使南朝鲜的经济附属于美国的经济，为美国的战争政策服务。
    例如，南朝鲜自己有钢铁工业，但生产的钢比倾销来的美国钢贵，于是仅有的一座三和制铁所关门大吉，仁川钢厂的生产也在时断时续，于是南朝鲜所需的钢材和机器就只好百分之百地靠美国。
    南朝鲜自己有水泥厂，可是今年南朝鲜只需要四十万吨水泥，而美国水泥已涌进来六十一万吨之多，南朝鲜的水泥厂只好都“面临破产”。南朝鲜有化学工业，但在五光十色的美国尼龙、塑料的冲击下，连丝织厂最近也纷纷倒闭。至于南朝鲜的“东洋化学工厂”只好变成“鹿、兔子和松鼠的公园”了。
    南朝鲜的纺织工业在战后有一些发展，这是由于美国需要销售剩余棉花的缘故。现在南朝鲜的纺织工业百分之百是用美棉，这样一来，原来盛产棉花的南朝鲜去年上市的棉花只有十万斤，而1949年还生产了一亿三千九百多万斤棉花。而且纺织工业近年来也因为销路不畅，开工的不过三分之一。
    像棉花的生产一样，原来号称粮仓、农业生产占主要地位的南朝鲜，已变成了美国“剩余”农产品的市场，变成了“饿乡”。
    十四年来美国向南朝鲜销售了约三千万石（每石一百五十公斤）粮食，使南朝鲜农民生产的粮食卖不出成本，播种面积减少了六十万町步，去年南朝鲜所用的每一百斤粮中就有美国粮食二十三斤，而在过去南朝鲜是每年出口数百万石粮食的。
    美“援”这颗糖衣炮弹，现在早已化尽了糖衣，而在南朝鲜国民经济的深处大爆炸而特爆炸了。今年美国不顾南朝鲜已积压了足够两年消费的烟草的事实，硬要卖给南朝鲜五百美元的烟草。南朝鲜的“产业经济新闻”最近发表社论说：这将是对南朝鲜“烟草栽培业的致命打击”，将使“国产烟草完全无影无踪”。不久前南朝鲜的一些小企业主和手工业者抗议美国倾销刮脸刀、渔网、汽车零件，因为美国货抢了他们的生意。
    美国的这种明为“援助”暗是侵略的骗人把戏，已经被南朝鲜人民识破了。
    在美国生活方式的腐蚀下
    美国生活方式像一条毒蛇，钻入南朝鲜人民特别是青年的思想灵魂中。
    鼓吹美国生活方式最力的美国电影，已在南朝鲜泛滥了十几年，打开今年5月份的南朝鲜报纸，汉城已在上演着“血斗的溪谷”、“恐怖的街道”、“伊卡王国的秘密”等美国恐怖片和色情片。
    这些影片的恶劣影响从一个例子就可以看出来，南朝鲜的少年罪犯正在年年增加，去年一年就有一万八千六百九十个少年犯罪。他们仿效美国影片中的镜头，组织“骷髅团”、“狮子团”等暴力团体，在大街上袭击汽车，用手枪抢劫，诱骗少女。
    在美国电影的影响下，南朝鲜摄制的影片也变成了美国电影的翻版。今年南朝鲜已摄制和计划摄制的影片中有90％是鼓吹战争、色情和带有虚无主义的毒素的。不久前摄制的“春香传”，剧中男主角李梦龙变成了手持手枪、带着黑眼镜的标准的美国式的流氓，春香成为一个“妖妇”，南朝鲜报纸也叹息说：“这是对民族古典艺术的不能容忍的侮辱”。但李承晚对这些却大为欣赏，不久前他看了南朝鲜摄制的一部色情片“因为爱他”后，竟无耻地指令“文教部”给予奖励。
    南朝鲜的文学阵地也被美国的鼓吹战争、色情、颓废的作品所占领。不久前得到李承晚集团的“自由文学奖”的文学作品中，大部分是战争文学，其中大肆煽动人对人的仇恨。南朝鲜的一个反动诗人柳致环在他的一首诗中写到：“啊！真是孤独的孤独，虚无的虚无，即使有事也是无聊，我又躺下来了，重新躺下来，在零上又加了几万个零。”
