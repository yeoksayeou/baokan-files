Title: One Side Wants to Share Atomic Secrets, The Other Wants to Maintain Control Privileges: France and the U.S. and Britain Break Out in New Quarrel Again

While representatives of the member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization were holding an "Atlantic Conference" in London, touting "close cooperation among allies," and Eisenhower was boasting that the North Atlantic "has developed a close cooperation never seen in peacetime," the French government under De Gaulle and its Atlantic "allies," especially the United States, broke out in a new quarrel.

On June 8, after De Gaulle met with French Foreign Minister Couve de Murville and U.S. Admiral Wright in Paris, the French Foreign Ministry officially announced that negotiations between France and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization on the issue of storing nuclear weapons on French territory had reached a deadlock. According to reports, De Gaulle told the United States that unless the U.S. and Britain shared atomic secrets with France, enabling France to jointly manage the nuclear weapons stored by the United States on French territory, "France would not undertake further obligations to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization." However, the "Washington Post" said, "The U.S. government has been unwilling to accept either of these demands." United Press International also reported that neither the United States nor Britain has been willing to share control of the nuclear weapons stored on French territory with France.

As "U.S. News & World Report" put it, France "is starting to pull out the teeth of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization one by one." This is already the "fifth tooth" of this aggressive organization that De Gaulle has deliberately pulled out. Previously, De Gaulle's demand to establish a "Big Three core of the U.S., Britain, and France" had already led to a conflict between France and the U.S. and Britain for leadership. On the issue of establishing U.S. missile bases in France, De Gaulle again made the negotiation of missile bases fail by making his control of nuclear warheads a condition. At the same time, De Gaulle also demanded that the French fighter squadrons not be under the command of the North Atlantic Group Command. In March of this year, the French government openly violated the regulations of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and decided that, whether in peacetime or wartime, the French fleet in the Mediterranean would be controlled by France itself. At that time, many Western news agencies reported that all of this actually showed France's "fundamental dissatisfaction with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization," especially "further actions taken because the United States and Britain did not take any action regarding his proposal for the three countries to jointly formulate a global plan."

However, since then, France's demand to be "on an equal footing" with the U.S. and Britain and to join the ranks of "atomic powers" has not received a favorable response from the United States. In fact, the United States is still giving France the runaround and exerting pressure. In mid-April, during the U.S. Senate's discussion of "whether France should receive full aid," some senators openly criticized France's decision to independently manage its Mediterranean fleet, believing that this would affect France's continued receipt of U.S. aid. Shortly after, the United States announced with another face that the United States was prepared to sell its unwanted "Regulus II" intermediate-range missiles or the manufacturing rights of these missiles to France in order to win it over. However, the United States has remained deaf and mute to France's urgent desire for "atomic secrets" and "great power status." Even Dulles's promise last July to give De Gaulle the enriched uranium needed to build atomic submarines is now being reneged on by the United States. According to news from Washington, there is a pressure forming in the U.S. Congress to oppose providing France with enriched uranium and technical data. Therefore, this has added new grievances to France's old ones. Not long ago, the French Ambassador to the United States, Alphand, publicly complained that the United States was unwilling to share atomic secrets with France. He also said that France must "fully participate in the responsibilities assumed by the West and the decisions to be made." Therefore, the deadlock in this French-American talk is the result of the development of this dissatisfaction in France.

Therefore, French newspapers are trying their best to defend De Gaulle and attack the United States. The French newspaper "Le Monde" said that most of the demands made by De Gaulle were justified. The newspaper accused the United States of saying:
	"One cannot be an ally here and an enemy elsewhere. ...The atomic policy of the United States, which does not tell its friends the atomic secrets that the enemy already knows clearly, is obviously extremely absurd." "Le Monde" admitted: "The discord between France and its allies is intensifying."

### 一方要分享原子秘密　一方要保持控制特权  法国和美英又爆发新争吵

    一方要分享原子秘密　一方要保持控制特权
    法国和美英又爆发新争吵
    本报讯　正当北大西洋集团成员国的代表们在伦敦举行“大西洋会议”，鼓吹“盟国紧密合作”，艾森豪威尔也吹嘘北大西洋“已经发展了一种在和平时期从未有过的密切合作”的时候，法国戴高乐政府又和它的大西洋“盟国”，特别是美国之间爆发了一场新的争吵。
    6月8日，当戴高乐在巴黎接见法国外长德姆维尔和美国海军上将赖特之后，法国外交部正式宣布：法国和北大西洋公约组织之间关于在法国领土上储存核武器问题的谈判已陷入僵局。据报道，戴高乐向美国表示，除非美、英把原子秘密告诉法国，使法国能共管美国储存在法国领土上的核武器，“否则法国将不对北大西洋公约组织承担进一步的义务”。但是“华盛顿邮报”说，“美国政府却一直不愿意接受其中任何一个要求。”合众国际社也报道：不论是美国还是英国都一直不愿意同法国共同掌握对储存在法国领土上的核武器的控制权。
    正像“美国新闻与世界报道”所说，法国“正在开始一个一个地拔掉北大西洋公约组织的牙齿”，这次已经是戴高乐故意拔掉这个侵略组织的“第五颗牙齿”了。在此以前戴高乐的关于建立“美英法三巨头核心”的要求，就曾导致了一场法国和美英争夺领导权的冲突。在法国建立美国导弹基地问题上，戴高乐又以由他掌握核弹头为条件，使导弹基地的谈判告吹。与此同时，戴高乐又要求法国的战斗机队不归北大西洋集团司令部指挥。今年3月，法国政府更公然违背北大西洋公约组织的规定，决定不论在和平或战争时期，法国在地中海的舰队都由法国自己控制。当时，许多西方通讯社报道，这一切实际上表现了法国“对北大西洋公约组织的根本不满”，特别是“由于美国和英国对于他的关于三国共同拟订全球计划的建议没有采取什么行动”而
  “作出的进一步做法”。
    但是，自那时以来，法国要跟美英“平起平坐”，跻身于“原子大国”地位的要求，一直没有从美国那里得到有利的反应。实际上，美国依然是向法国进行敷衍，并施加压力。4月中旬，美国参议院在讨论“法国是否应该得到充分援助”时，一些参议员公然指责法国自管地中海舰队的决定，认为这对法国继续获得美援有影响”。不久之后，美国又以另一副面孔宣布：美国准备把它不打算要的“雷古鲁斯二号”中程导弹或是这种导弹的制造权卖给法国，以资拉拢。但是对于法国所急迫想要的“原子秘密”和“大国地位”，美国却一直装聋作哑。甚至杜勒斯在去年7月答应过给戴高乐制造原子潜水艇所需的浓缩铀，现在美国也准备赖账。据华盛顿的消息说，美国国会中正在形成一种压力，反对向法国提供浓缩铀和技术资料。因此，这就使法国旧怨未平又添新怨。不久前法国驻美大使阿尔芳公开埋怨美国不肯把原子秘密告诉法国。他还说，法国必须“充分参与西方担负的责任和要作出的决定”。因此，这一次法国和美国会谈的僵局，正是法国这种不满的发展的结果。
    因此，法国报纸却竭力为戴高乐辩护，攻击美国。法国“世界报”说：戴高乐提出的大部分要求都是有根据的。这家报纸指责美国说：
  “人们不能在这里是盟友在其他地方是敌人。……美国不把敌人已明摆着知道的原子秘密告诉朋友的原子政策，显然是极荒谬的”。“世界报”承认：“法国和它盟国之间的龃龉正在加剧”。（附图片）
