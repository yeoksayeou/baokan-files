Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 15th -- Armed struggle against the dictatorial regime has recently broken out in the Dominican Republic, in the Caribbean Sea. According to a report today by "Radio Free Dominican Republic," a truck carrying troops of the Trujillo dictatorial regime was ambushed yesterday near the town of Constanza in central Dominican Republic by anti-dictatorial armed personnel.

The radio station said that the attack was very successful. The well-equipped anti-dictatorial armed forces annihilated the enemy troops and burned the truck. Reports say that after the ambush, the anti-dictatorial armed personnel returned to the mountains.

The Trujillo regime is one of the few tottering dictatorial regimes currently in Latin America. Supported by U.S. imperialism, Trujillo has carried out twenty-eight years of bloody rule in the Dominican Republic, plundering huge amounts of wealth from the people. U.S. imperialism has consistently used the Dominican Republic as a base to support other dictatorial regimes in Latin America and suppress national independence movements in the Caribbean region.

    多米尼加响起反独裁枪声
    反独裁武装在中部袭击政府军告捷
    新华社哈瓦那15日电　在加勒比海的多米尼加最近爆发了反独裁政权的武装斗争。据“自由多米尼加电台”今天报道，一辆载运特鲁希略独裁政权军队的卡车昨天在多米尼加中部的康斯坦萨镇附近遭到反独裁武装人员的伏击。
    这家电台说，这次袭击非常成功。装备良好的反独裁武装部队歼灭了敌军，并烧毁了卡车。有消息说，在这次伏击以后，反独裁武装人员又回到山上去了。
    特鲁希略政权是目前拉丁美洲少数几个摇摇欲坠的独裁政权当中的一个。在美帝国主义支持下，特鲁希略在多米尼加进行了二十八年的血腥统治，向人民掠夺了巨额财富。美帝国主义过去一贯利用多米尼加作为支持拉丁美洲其他独裁政权和镇压加勒比海地区民族独立运动的基地。
