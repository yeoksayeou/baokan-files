Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, June 13th (Reporter Xu Fangyi) reports: Shanghai has two construction sites that both adopted rapid construction. One achieved more, faster, better, and more economical results, while the other was characterized by less, slower, poorer, and more expensive outcomes. The builders of the Shanghai Cable Factory's communication cable workshop, based on strictly implementing reasonable rules and regulations, carried out high-speed construction, shortening the civil engineering construction period from the original planned twenty days to twelve and a half days. The engineering quality all reached first-class standards, and the cost per square meter was only a little over seventy-six yuan. However, the construction unit of the Jingye Machine Factory's foundry workshop, due to not following regulations and blindly pursuing speed, resulted in major rework after the factory building was completed, with a cost of about one hundred and thirty yuan per square meter (the plan was eighty yuan).

The Shanghai No. 5 Construction Engineering Company's 503rd Engineering Area undertook the construction of the Shanghai Cable Factory's communication cable workshop project. Before construction, this engineering area mobilized the masses to speak out freely three times, launching debates to clarify that rapid construction must be carried out under the condition of ensuring quality. Based on their years of construction experience, they believed that to achieve both fast construction speed and good engineering quality, it was necessary to strictly implement the necessary construction procedures. They spent ten days carefully reviewing and familiarizing themselves with the factory building design drawings designed by the design department, and then drew up a construction organization design based on the factory building design drawings, determined reasonable construction methods, and compiled a meticulous construction schedule. During the review of the design drawings, they found errors in certain places in the drawings. Even if the errors were very small, they would consult with the design department and the user unit to make modifications after careful study. During the construction process, they found that the soil quality of the factory building's foundation was too loose. Based on their past construction experience, if construction was carried out according to the original design, after a long period of time, the foundation would not be able to withstand the heavy pressure of the factory building and would gradually sink. They immediately reported this to the design department and the user unit. After repeated debates among the three parties and recalculation, the design was modified. According to the newly revised design, large stone slabs were needed at the bottom of the foundation to enhance the compressive capacity, which increased the workload of the construction department. However, this engineering area was willing to do more work rather than allow the engineering quality to be affected.

However, the Shanghai No. 3 Construction Engineering Company, which was responsible for the Jingye Machine Factory's foundry workshop project, did not do so. This company unilaterally understood rapid construction as "fast" without understanding that "fast" must include "good." Before construction, the construction unit purchased a standard design drawing for a workshop with an annual output of 5,000 tons of iron castings from the design department, while the production capacity of the new workshop was required to reach 10,000 tons. The standard design drawing and the requirements of the new workshop were completely different. According to regulations, the construction unit should have entrusted the design department to design it separately, and the construction unit—Shanghai No. 3 Construction Engineering Company—should not have accepted such drawings. However, because they were eager to achieve quick results, they did not do so. They took the drawings and modified them themselves, and in the process of modifying the design, they did not consult with the construction unit or solicit the opinions of the design department. They hastily rushed out such a complex factory building design in two days, but the result was that the modifications were wrong. They raised the height of the "air tower" for ventilation and cooling by seventy-five millimeters and changed the structure of the "air tower," but the roof truss that bore the pressure of the "air tower" was not changed accordingly. After the factory building was completed, the crane started running, making "hollow" and "hollow" sounds, the roof truss had cracks, and the factory building was slightly shaking. The new workshop quickly became a dangerous building.

Whether or not to strictly implement the quality inspection system is also an important reason for determining the quality of these two projects. The cable factory construction site specifically established a technical supervision station. Even during the tense construction phase where every second counted, the workers strictly adhered to the quality inspection system of not continuing construction without acceptance after each process was completed. However, the Jingye factory construction site did not have these technical management systems. According to regulations, materials such as cement, yellow sand, and stones in concrete should have a certain proportion. However, they did not weigh the yellow sand and stones, but just roughly estimated and poured them directly into the mixer by large baskets and small baskets. Many prefabricated components were simply placed during installation. As a result, some roof trusses were placed off-center, and some roof panels were not placed correctly.

Both of these projects started construction in August of last year. Now, the Jingye Machine Factory's foundry workshop project, which is of poor quality, is being rushed to be repaired, reinforced, and remedied.

In order to educate the city's construction workers to establish a comprehensive view of more, faster, better, and more economical results, the leading departments such as the Shanghai Municipal Basic Construction Committee and the Shanghai Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau have, on the one hand, specifically inspected the Jingye factory project, summarized the lessons learned, and issued a circular; on the other hand, they have organized workers from various construction sites to go to the cable factory construction site to learn from their experience.

### 上海电缆厂通讯电缆车间施工单位  遵守规章速度快质量好  精业机器厂铸工车间建设单位滥改设计  片面求快质量差成本高

    上海电缆厂通讯电缆车间施工单位
    遵守规章速度快质量好
    精业机器厂铸工车间建设单位滥改设计
    片面求快质量差成本高
    新华社上海13日电　记者徐方义报道：上海有两个同样采用快速施工的工地，一个做到了多快好省，一个却是少慢差费。上海电缆厂通讯电缆车间的建设者，在严格执行合理的规章制度基础上进行高速度施工，使土建工程的施工期由原计划的二十天缩短到十二天半，工程质量全部达到一级品，每平方公尺造价只有七十六元多。可是精业机器厂铸工车间的建设单位，由于不按制度办事，片面求快，结果厂房落成以后不得不大事返工，每平方公尺造价高达一百三十元左右（计划是八十元）。
    承建上海电缆厂通讯电缆车间工程的，是上海市第五建筑工程公司五○三工区。这个工区在施工前，三次发动职工群众大鸣大放，展开争辩，明确了快速施工必须在保证质量的条件下进行。他们根据多年施工的经验，认为既要做到施工速度快，又要做到工程质量好，必须严格执行必要的施工规程。他们花了十天的时间，仔细审查和熟悉设计部门设计的厂房设计图，又根据厂房设计图绘制了施工组织设计，确定合理的施工方法，编排缜密的施工进度表。在审查设计图中，他们发现图纸某些地方有错误，即使是很小的错误，也要会同设计部门和使用单位一起，经过仔细研究以后再作修改。在施工过程中，他们发现厂房地基的土质过于松软，根据他们过去施工经验，如果按照原设计施工，年代一久，基础将经不起厂房沉重的压力，会逐渐沉陷。他们立即向设计部门和使用单位反映。经过三方面反复争辩，再度计算以后，修改了设计。按照新修改的设计，需要在基础的下面再用大石片填底，以增强受压能力，这样就增加了建筑部门的工作量。但是，这个工区宁肯多做些工作，也不愿使工程质量受影响。
    可是，负责精业机器厂铸工车间工程的上海市第三建筑工程公司，却不是那样。这个公司把快速施工片面地理解为“快”，没有理解“快”中必须有“好”。在施工前，建设单位向设计部门买了一份年产五千吨铸铁件车间标准设计图，而新建车间的生产能力却要求达到一万吨。标准设计图和新建车间的要求完全不同。按照规定，建设单位应该委托设计部门另行设计，施工单位——上海市第三建筑工程公司也不应该接受这样的图纸。但是，这个公司因为急于求成，却没有这样做。他们把图纸拿来就自行修改，而且在修改设计中，没有会同建设单位研究，征求设计部门的意见。这样一项复杂的厂房设计，他们在两天之内就仓促地突击出来了，可是结果却修改错了。他们把通风降温用的“气楼”加高了七十五公厘，把“气楼”的结构也改变了，而承受“气楼”压力的屋架却没有相应地改变。厂房落成以后，行车开动起来，发出“空洞”、“空洞”的响声，屋架有了裂缝，厂房微微摇晃。新建车间很快就变成了危险房屋。
    是否严格执行质量检验制度，也是决定这两项工程质量好坏的一个重要原因。电缆厂工地专门建立了技术监督站，即使在分秒必争的施工紧张阶段，工人们也是严格遵守每道工序完工后，不验收不继续施工的质量检验制。而精业厂工地却没有这些技术管理制度。按规定，混凝土中的水泥、黄沙、石子等材料，都应有一定的比例。但他们对黄沙、石子却不过磅，毛估一下就大箩、小箩地直往搅拌机里倒。许多预制构件在安装时，也是放上就算。结果，有的屋架放偏了，有的屋面板搁得不正。
    这两项工程都是在去年8月动工兴建的。现在，质量不好的精业机器厂铸工车间的工程，正在抢修加固，加以补救。
    为了教育全市建筑职工树立多快好省的全面观点，上海市基本建设委员会、上海市建筑工程局等领导部门，一方面专门对精业厂工程作检查，总结了教训，并且发出了通报；一方面组织各工地职工前往电缆厂工地学习经验。
