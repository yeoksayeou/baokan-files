The Labor People's Vow
—The Bulgarian People Strive to Complete the Five-Year Plan Ahead of Schedule
    Since the Bulgarian Communist Party issued the call at its November plenary session last year to accelerate the development of the national economy and complete the Five-Year Plan (1958-1962) ahead of schedule, a high tide has emerged in all sectors of Bulgaria's national economy in the past six months, achieving brilliant successes. Laboring people throughout Bulgaria have been tapping potential and finding ingenious solutions, forming a nationwide movement to complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. Industrial workers have proposed to guarantee the completion of the industrial aspects of the Five-Year Plan in four years through practical actions such as fully utilizing equipment in enterprises, improving labor organization, and improving workers' technical skills. Agricultural workers have further expressed their determination to fully utilize the advantages of large cooperatives, and to ensure the completion of the agricultural aspects of the Five-Year Plan in three years through measures such as large-scale water conservancy projects, maximizing the use of machinery and manure. From the following vows of several ordinary Bulgarian workers, it can be seen that the Bulgarian people have full confidence in completing the tasks put forward by the Party.
      Our words are the words of miners
    Yossefov, the captain of the coal mining team at the Nienkov coal mine in Dimitrovo City, said: "We, the miners of Dimitrovo City, respond to the Party's call for 'completing the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule' by guaranteeing the completion of the Five-Year Plan in four years. Our words are the words of miners, and we will complete what we guarantee. Now, leaders and miners are discussing improving labor organization, increasing productivity, and maximizing the use of technical capabilities. Our mine, named after Nienkov, is the oldest mine in Dimitrovo City, and our team is known for quickly adopting advanced experiences. We were the first to implement the single-cycle system, the first to adopt the advanced experience of the Soviet miner Mamai, and are fighting to reduce production costs, so our mine has been the national champion for five consecutive years. We completed the 1958 plan thirty days ahead of schedule, and we saved nearly one million leva (Bulgarian currency) in the struggle to reduce costs. Miners have put forward one hundred and eighty rationalization proposals, many of which have been put into practice. My coal mining team works according to Mamai's working methods, and will produce an additional one thousand six hundred kilograms of coal per day in the future. We work with all our strength to complete the Five-Year Plan as soon as possible, so that our people can live a more pleasant and glorious life."
    The land can offer more abundant fruits
    Razsolkov, the production team leader of the Granitsa Village cooperative in the Kyustendil region, said: "The Kyustendil Plain is very fertile, but if all local water resources can be utilized for irrigation, the yield here can be greatly increased. After the merger of agricultural production cooperatives, the possibility of increasing yields has greatly increased. Our Granitsa Village agricultural production cooperative merged with six surrounding cooperatives and proposed the task of expanding the irrigated area. In November 1958, we began to build dams and completed the project before the end of the year. The reservoir can hold 180,000 cubic meters of water, which is used to irrigate corn and tobacco. The second reservoir is being built in Bagrentsi Village, which will be much larger than the first reservoir. It can hold 2.4 million cubic meters of water and irrigate 5,000 decares (equivalent to 1.5 mu). However, cooperative members unanimously agree that these two reservoirs are not enough. To complete the Five-Year Plan in three years, it is necessary to turn half of the cultivated land into irrigated areas. Therefore, we began to build two more reservoirs. One of them can hold about 4 million cubic meters of water, and the other is smaller in scale. They know that the labor invested in water conservancy construction will be repaid a hundredfold. Last year, we produced an average of 110 kilograms of tobacco per decare. In 1959, the yield will be increased to 140 kilograms. In 1958, the average corn yield was 150 kilograms per decare, and this year it will be doubled. We mainly rely on expanding the irrigated area to achieve this leap forward. Cooperative members are overcoming obstacles in their path with firm determination and moving towards high yields. All their work is for the happiness of the people."
        We must carry out large-scale water conservancy projects
    Nachev, a hydraulic design engineer, said: "Expanding the irrigated area is a huge potential in the struggle for high yields. The November plenary session of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party, taking into account the effectiveness of water conservancy construction, put forward the task of vigorously building irrigation systems and making fuller use of water resources. The plenary session called on cooperative farmers to use their own strength to build reservoirs, pumping stations, and irrigation canals during the slack winter months. The Bulgarian people warmly responded to the Party's call. Cooperative members, cadres of institutions, and intellectuals participated in the construction, striving to complete the agricultural aspects of the Five-Year Plan in three years. Cooperative members in the Sofia region decided to build a water conservancy system that can irrigate 290,000 decares of cultivated land. The design team assigned to the agricultural production cooperative helped the cooperative formulate a design plan for reservoirs and irrigation canals that can irrigate 102,000 decares of land. The designers plan to open up more irrigated areas and lead the work of water conservancy construction projects. At the Gahov Bridge in the Ihtiman City area, a reservoir project that can store 440,000 cubic meters of water is in full swing. The water here can be used to irrigate 2,000 decares of land. In Bagrentsi Village in the Kyustendil region, a reservoir is being built that can irrigate 5,000 decares of land. At the same time, funds provided by the state to this state will be used to carry out water conservancy measures on 271,000 decares of land. After the irrigation system in the Sofia region is completed, 78 villages will be irrigated. Due to the construction of ponds, reservoirs, pumping stations, etc., the irrigated area in the Sofia region will reach 561,000 decares in recent years." (Attached picture)

### 劳动人民的誓言——保加利亚人民为提前完成五年计划而奋斗

    劳动人民的誓言
    ——保加利亚人民为提前完成五年计划而奋斗
    自从保加利亚共产党去年11月全会发出加速发展国民经济、提前完成五年计划（1958—1962年）的号召以后，在这半年多时间里，保加利亚国民经济各个部门都出现了高涨的局面，获得了辉煌的成就。保加利亚各地劳动人民纷纷挖潜力，找窍门，形成了提前完成五年计划的全民运动。工业劳动者提出，要以充分利用企业中的设备、改善劳动组织、提高工人技术水平等实际行动，保证四年完成工业方面的五年计划。农业劳动者则更进一步表示要充分发挥大社的优越性，以大兴水利、最大限度地使用机器和粪肥等措施，保证三年完成农业方面的五年计划。从下面几个保加利亚普通劳动者的誓言中，就可以看出保加利亚人民有充分的信心来完成党所提出的任务。
      我们的话是矿工的话
    季米特洛沃市涅恩科夫煤矿采煤工作队队长约瑟弗夫表示：“我们，季米特洛沃市的矿工以保证四年完成五年计划回答党关于‘提前完成五年计划’的号召。我们的话是矿工的话，我们保证了就要完成。现在领导者和矿工正在讨论改进劳动组织、提高生产率、最大限度地使用技术能力。我们以涅恩科夫为名的矿是季米特洛沃市煤矿中最老的矿，我们的工作队以迅速采用先进经验而著称。我们最早推行单循环制，最早采用苏联矿工马马依的先进经验，正在为降低生产成本而斗争，因此我们的矿已经连续五年为全国冠军。我们提前三十天完成了1958年计划，我们在降低成本的斗争中几乎节约了一百万列弗（保币）。矿工们提出了一百八十件合理化建议，其中很多已经付诸实践了。我领导的采煤小队按马马依的工作方法工作，今后每天将超额生产一千六百公斤煤。我们以全部力量进行工作，使五年计划早日完成，使我国人民过更愉快更光辉的生活。”
    土地能献出更丰硕的果实
    丘斯钦其尔地区格拉尼查村大社生产队长拉兹索尔科夫表示：“丘斯钦其尔平原很富饶，可是如果能利用当地所有水利资源进行灌溉的话，这里的产量还能大大提高。农业生产合作社合并以后，提高产量的可能性大大增加了。我们格拉尼查村的农业生产合作社合并了周围六个社，提出了扩大灌溉面积的任务。1958年11月，我们开始建筑堤坝，年底以前结束了这项工程。水库能容水十八万立方公尺，用以浇灌玉米和烟草。第二个水库正在巴格连齐村建造，它将比第一个水库大许多。它能容水两百四十万立方公尺，灌溉五千狄卡尔（合一点五市亩）土地。然而，社员们一致公认，这两个水库还不够。要在三年内完成五年计划，就需要把一半耕地变为灌溉面积。因此我们开始再兴建两个水库。其中一个能容水约四百万立方公尺，另一个规模较小。他们知道，在水利建设方面付出的劳动会得到百倍的报酬。去年，我们平均每狄卡尔生产一百一十公斤烟草。1959年产量将提高为一百四十公斤。1958年玉米产量平均每狄卡尔一百五十公斤，今年将翻一番。我们主要靠扩大灌溉面积实现这个跃进。合作社社员以坚定的决心克服着前进中的障碍，走向丰产。他们的全部工作都是为了人民的幸福。”
        我们要大兴水利
    水力设计工程师纳切夫表示：“扩大灌溉面积是争取高产斗争中的巨大潜力。保加利亚共产党中央委员会十一月全会考虑到水利建设的效果，提出了大力兴修灌溉系统、更全面利用水力资源的任务。全会号召合作农民用自己的力量，在冬季农闲的几个月里建造水库、抽水站和灌溉渠。保加利亚人民热烈响应党的号召。合作社社员、机关干部、知识分子都参加了建设，争取三年完成农业方面的五年计划。索非亚州合作社社员决定兴建能灌溉二十九万狄卡尔耕地的水利系统。分配到农业生产合作社的设计小组帮助合作社拟定了能灌溉十万二千狄卡尔土地的蓄水池和灌溉渠的设计方案。设计师计划开辟更多的灌溉面积并领导水利建设工程的工作。在伊赫提曼城地区加霍夫桥的地方一个能蓄四十四万立方公尺水的水库工程正全速进行。用这里的水可以灌溉两千狄卡尔土地。在丘斯钦其尔地区巴格连齐村正在兴建一个能灌溉五千狄卡尔土地的水库。同时，将用国家给这个州的资金，在二十七万一千狄卡尔土地上进行水利措施。索非亚州灌溉系统建设完工后，将有七十八个村得到灌溉。由于建造水塘、蓄水池、抽水站等，索非亚地区的灌溉面积最近几年内将达到五十六万一千狄卡尔。”（附图片）
