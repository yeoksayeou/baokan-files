    Our Vegetable Growing Experience
    The cadres of our Grain Bureau have grown their own vegetables and have achieved self-sufficiency in vegetable consumption for the agency. In our vegetable garden, 8.33 acres have even achieved "four crops": the first crop of spinach yielded 205 jin, the second crop of cabbage yielded 320 jin, the third crop of cabbage yielded 204 jin, and the fourth crop of early-maturing zucchini has already yielded 50 jin and sweet potato seedlings 13 jin, totaling more than 790 jin. Our methods are: First, reasonable close planting. Second, seizing the season and the crop cycle, intercropping and companion planting. When the spinach is harvested, we immediately plant Chinese cabbage; before the second crop of Chinese cabbage grows up, we immediately interplant early-maturing zucchini. When the cabbage is harvested, the zucchini grows up; when the zucchini is harvested, the autumn wax gourd grows up. At the same time, chili peppers are interplanted around the vegetable field. In this way, one cycle follows another, ensuring that "there are more vegetables than can be eaten from the garden." Third, apply more fertilizer and strengthen vegetable garden management. We always add a lot of base fertilizer, and after the seedlings emerge, we apply urine and manure fertilizer, chemical fertilizer, and frequently water and loosen the soil, to achieve the requirements of "fertile soil, no waterlogging or drought, strong seedlings, and continuous bumper harvests."

    我们种菜的经验
    我们粮食局的干部自种蔬菜，已经做到机关吃菜自给。在我们的菜园中，有八厘三毫地还达到“四熟”：一茬菠菜收二百零五斤，二茬白菜收三百二十斤，三茬白菜收二百零四斤，四茬早熟笋瓜已收五十斤、红芋秧十三斤，合计七百九十多斤。我们的办法是：第一、合理密植。第二、抓季节、抓茬口、混种套种。我们在菠菜收完时，马上种上小白菜；不等二茬小白菜长大，马上就间种早熟笋瓜。白菜收过，笋瓜长起；笋瓜收起，秋东瓜长起。同时还在菜地周围间栽辣椒。这样一环套一环，保证“蔬菜满园吃不完”。第三、多施肥料，加强菜园管理。每次总是多加底肥，出苗后施加尿粪肥、化肥，并经常浇水、松土，达到“土质肥沃，不涝不旱，菜苗茁壮，丰收不断”的要求。
