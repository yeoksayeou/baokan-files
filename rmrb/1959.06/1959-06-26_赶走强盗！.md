Drive Away the Robbers!
    Liu Chao
    Today, a huge voice resounds across the entire Korean Peninsula: "U.S. troops get out of South Korea!"
    This shout of "Get out!" contains the Korean people's boundless anger. When a mangy dog runs into someone's home, sprawls on the floor doing whatever it pleases, and exudes a stench and germs, people naturally shout angrily, "Get out!" But the American imperialists are wolves, a thousand times more ferocious than a mangy dog. In the nine years that the wolves have been in the house, their bloody crimes are countless.
    The withdrawal of American troops from South Korea is clearly stipulated in the Korean Armistice Agreement. However, the U.S. government has violated the armistice agreement, not only clinging to South Korea and refusing to leave, but also intensifying its military buildup and plotting war conspiracies. The United States has expanded the Rhee Syngman puppet army from sixteen divisions at the time of the armistice to thirty-one divisions, and has transported new weapons such as atomic missiles into South Korea, turning South Korea into a base for atomic warfare. At the behest of their American masters, the Rhee Syngman clique allocates large budgets every year for military expansion and war preparations. In the 1959 budget, more than 70% was for military and police expenses, an increase of 614 times compared to 1949, while the so-called "people's livelihood expenses" accounted for only 4% of the total budget. What are they busy with? The ink on the armistice agreement is barely dry, and this group of pirates is already showing its hideous faces. Didn't the chairman of the U.S. "Foreign Aid Program Research Committee" openly admit that South Korea is the U.S.'s "real front line"? Their wolfish ambitions are clear for all to see, and no amount of rhetoric can cover them up.
    Where there are germs, there is plague; where there are U.S. troops, there is disaster. This has become a rule. However, in South Korea, the unbridled and reckless behavior of the American robbers has reached its peak. The crimes of that group of two-legged beasts revealed in the newspapers these past few days have once again shown the world what kind of stuff those who boast of being "civilized" are made of at their core. In 1957, the U.S. military headquarters moved from Japan to Seoul and seized 430,000 "pyong" (one pyong is equivalent to 3.306 square meters) of land. All the large buildings and facilities in Seoul were forcibly occupied by the U.S. military. According to a recent article "Impressions of South Korea" by Tom Dineley, a special correspondent for the American "New York World-Telegram and the Sun," these buildings are almost all hung with signs saying "No Admittance." The U.S. military in South Korea acts as if it were the "master." However, these "No Admittance" signs are simply an irony for the American robbers who invaded Korea. Who is the real "master" on Korean soil, and who is the "outsider" on Korean soil? This is a question that even a three-year-old child can answer. In fact, in the eyes of the Korean people, the U.S. military is not just an "outsider," it is simply a "robber," occupying people's houses, ravaging people's wives and daughters, slaughtering people's children, and then hanging a "No Admittance" sign on the door. This is something that even a robber would not dare to do, but the U.S. military actually dares to do it!
    There is no good when wolves enter the house; it is even more of a disaster when American robbers refuse to leave South Korea. The Korean people and the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea are making unremitting efforts to drive away the robbers and strive for the early realization of the peaceful reunification of the motherland. We also firmly participate in this battle to drive out the wolves!

    赶走强盗！
    刘潮
    今天，整个朝鲜半岛上响动着一个巨大的声音：“美军从南朝鲜滚出去！”
    这一声“滚出去！”是包含着朝鲜人民无限的愤怒之情的。癞皮狗跑到人的家里，横躺在地上为所欲为，全身散发着腥臭和细菌，人们自然要大声怒斥：“滚出去！”而美国帝国主义者却是比癞皮狗千百倍凶残的豺狼。豺狼入室九年，它的血腥罪行是不堪数计的。
    美国军队撤离南朝鲜，这是朝鲜停战协定上面作了明文规定的。可是，美国政府却违反停战协定，不但死赖在南朝鲜不走，反而变本加厉，不断加强军备，策划战争阴谋。美国已经把李承晚伪军由停战时的十六个师扩充到三十一个师，并且把原子导弹等新型武器运进南朝鲜，变南朝鲜为原子战争基地。在美国主子的授意下，李承晚集团每年都拨出大批预算进行扩军备战活动。1959年的预算中有70％以上是军事警察费，比1949年增加六百一十四倍，而所谓“民生费”仅占总预算的4％。他们在忙着什么？停战协定签字的墨迹未干，这群海盗们又露出狰狞的面目了，美国“援外计划研究委员会”主席不是公开招认南朝鲜是美国“真正的前线”吗？狼子野心，昭然若揭，什么样的花言巧语也是遮盖不住的。
    有病菌处，就有瘟疫；有美军处，就有灾难。这已经成为一条规律。然而在南朝鲜，美国强盗的横行无忌，为所欲为，却到了登峰造极的地步。这几天报上揭露的那群两脚野兽们的罪行，让世人再一次看清：那个自吹为“文明”的国家，骨子里是一些什么样的货色。1957年美军司令部由日本迁到汉城，强占土地四十三万坪（一坪相当于3.306平方公尺），汉城的大建筑物和设备全被美军强占。据美国“纽约世界电讯与太阳报”特派记者托姆·岛涅利最近在一篇“驻韩印象记”的文章中报道，这些建筑物几乎全部挂上了“闲人免进”的牌子。美军在南朝鲜，俨然是一副“主人”的态度。不过，这些“闲人免进”的牌子，对于侵略朝鲜的美国强盗简直是一种讽刺。究竟谁才是朝鲜国土上真正的“主人”，谁又是朝鲜国土上的“闲人”呢？这是连三岁幼童都能回答的问题。其实，在朝鲜人民的眼里，美国军队不只是“闲人”，简直就是“强盗”，霸占了人家的房屋，蹂躏了人家的妻女，残杀了人家的孩子，还在门口挂一块“闲人免进”的牌子，这是强盗也不敢做的，而美国军队居然敢做出来了！
    豺狼入室，没有好事；美国强盗赖在南朝鲜不走，更是祸害。朝鲜人民和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府正在为赶走强盗、争取早日实现祖国和平统一进行不懈的斗争，我们也坚决参加这个驱逐豺狼的战斗！
