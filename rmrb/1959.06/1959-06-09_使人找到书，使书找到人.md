Make People Find Books, Make Books Find People

    There are roughly two types of readers who go to bookstores to buy books. One type has a specific goal. They stand at the counter and ask the salesperson if they have a certain book. If they do, they are happy to buy it; if not, they leave disappointed. The other type doesn't have a specific goal, hoping to discover several suitable books while browsing. So, they go past the counter and look around at the bookshelves. If they happen to find something, they feel like they've found treasure. If they stand there for an hour or two without success, they can only sigh in vain. The latter are really "browsing" bookstores, and this type of person is quite numerous. Like many people, I have this habit of browsing bookstores.

    "Make books find people, make people find books" – these ten characters summarize the service spirit of bookstore staff. How much hard work it takes to achieve these two instances of "finding"! But how happy the reader should be when people find books and books find people!

    It is relatively easy to help the first type of person find books. How do you help the second type of person find books? I think we should start by organizing the bookshelves, making the classification and arrangement more scientific and more suitable for readers to browse.

    Readers sometimes feel "dazzled and overwhelmed" when they go to bookstores to buy books, because browsing the bookshelves is time-consuming and laborious. Broad categories like social sciences, literature and art… are clear, so the effort isn't spent here. The difficulty lies in the lack of subcategories within the broad categories, or the poor organization within the subcategories. In some bookstores or second-hand bookshops, you will find: ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign, all living together in one shelf; theory and creation mixed together, novels and poetry indistinguishable...

    It is possible for readers to "encounter" their favorite books by chance, but bookstore work must be done more and more carefully. The classification of books should not be done carelessly. Rationally arranging the book display, with each in its proper place, will naturally provide a lot of convenience to readers.

    使人找到书，使书找到人
    苏杭
    到书店买书的读者，大约有两类。一类有具体目标，站到柜台前，问营业员某某书有没有，有则喜而购之，无则扫兴而去。一类是没有具体目标，指望在浏览之中，发现若干合意的书，于是越过柜台，面对书架东张西望。偶有发现，如获珍宝，如果站上个把钟点不得要领，只好望洋兴叹了。后者真是“逛”书店的，这一类人为数相当可观，我和很多人一样，有着这么一种逛书店的习惯。
    “使书找到人，使人找到书”——十个字，概括了书店工作同志的服务精神。做到这里的两个“找”字，要付出多少辛勤的劳动！但是当人找到书，书找到人之后，读者该是多么喜悦！
    使前一类人找到书，比较好办。怎样让后一类人找到书？我想，应当从整顿书架入手，把分类、排列更加科学化，更加适合读者浏览。
    到书店买书的读者有时感到“眼花撩乱，望洋兴叹”，原因在于浏览书架费时费事。社会科学、文学艺术……大类清楚，事不费在这里。费事在于大类之中缺乏子目，或子目之中条理欠佳。在某些书店或旧书门市部里，你会发现：古今中外共居一格；理论与创作混杂，小说与诗歌不分……。
    读者跟他心爱的书“巧遇”，是会有的：但书店的工作总要愈做愈细，书籍的分类不宜马虎从事，合理调动书籍陈列队伍，各得其所，自然就会给读者很多的方便。
