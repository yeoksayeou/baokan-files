    To Make the Flames Burn Brighter, To Make Red Hearts More Steadfast
    The Play "Fiery Red Heart" is Being Rehearsed Anew

    (Our Newspaper) News: To make the "flames burn brighter and red hearts more steadfast," the Beijing People's Art Theatre, in cooperation with the playwright, has recently revised the play "Fiery Red Heart" and has begun rehearsing it anew. This excellent play, reflecting the spirit of the Great Leap Forward of our people, set a record for the highest attendance rate for modern plays when it was performed last year.

    The play was performed in rotation by two performance teams from the Beijing People's Art Theatre, running for three consecutive months with every performance sold out. The audience believed that the play, through the heroic images of demobilized soldiers Xu Guoqing, Zhang Fushan, He Dapao, etc., profoundly reflected the spirit of the Great Leap Forward of our people.

    The playwright of "Fiery Red Heart," Liu Chuan, in order to further enhance the ideological and artistic quality of the script, based on the feedback and opinions from various aspects after the play was performed, focused on highlighting the spirit of combining the promotion of revolutionary vigor with the study of science and technology in this revision and processing. The author also made important revisions to the characters of demobilized soldier Yang Ming and young intellectual Gao Jing, aiming to enable them to play a correct role in promoting the fighting traditions of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the spirit of the younger generation in studying science and technology, thereby making the characters' thoughts and personalities more prominent and authentic.

    In order to improve the play beyond its original level, the Beijing People's Art Theatre sent the vice president of the theatre and director of "Fiery Red Heart," Ouyang Shanzun, as well as individual actors and stage designers, to Zhejiang Changxing, where the story takes place, to experience life and collect materials, so that the performance would be more realistic. The cast has also been adjusted, and the scenery will be newer and more colorful.

    要烈火更旺　使红心更坚
    话剧“烈火红心”重新排练
    本报讯　要“烈火更旺，红心更坚”，北京人民艺术剧院同剧作者合作最近修改了话剧“烈火红心”，并且重新开始排练。这个反映我国人民大跃进的时代精神的优秀剧目，在去年演出时创造了现代剧目上座率最高纪录。
    这个戏由北京人民艺术剧院的两个演出队在北京轮换上演，连演三个月，场场客满。观众认为，这个戏通过复员军人许国清、张福山、何大炮等的英雄形象，深刻地反映出我国人民大跃进的时代精神。
    “烈火红心”的剧作者刘川为了使这个剧本的思想性和艺术性进一步提高，根据这个剧演出以后各方面的反映和意见，在这次修改和加工当中，着重突出了发扬革命干劲要同钻研科学技术相结合的精神。作者对复员军人杨明和青年知识分子高静这两个人物也做了重要修改，要使他们在发扬中国人民解放军的战斗传统、发挥青年一代钻研科学技术的精神方面，起正确的作用，从而使人物的思想、性格更加突出和真实。
    北京人民艺术剧院为了使这个戏能在原有水平上提高一步，曾派该院副院长、“烈火红心”的导演欧阳山尊以及个别演员和舞台设计人员专门到故事发生的地点浙江长兴去体验生活，搜集材料，以便演出更富有现实生活气息。演员阵容也作了新的调整，布景将更新颖而多采。
