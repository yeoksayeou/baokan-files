    History is Ruthless
    Mei Lanfang
    I want to sternly condemn the vicious conspiracy of U.S. imperialism to attempt to occupy South Korea for a long time. As everyone knows, six years have passed since the Korean armistice. The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has always adhered to the principle of peaceful reunification of the motherland. Our Chinese People's Volunteers have also faithfully followed the correct policy of peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and last year the Volunteers completely withdrew from Korea. When the Korean Armistice Agreement was first signed in 1953, I went to Korea once and personally witnessed the devastation caused by the war in many areas, as well as the bloody crimes committed by U.S. imperialism in northern Korea. The aggressors' reckless actions did not diminish the high morale of the people in northern Korea, and justice finally triumphed over violence. However, in the past six years, under the correct leadership of the Korean Workers' Party, northern Korea has rapidly restored its national economy destroyed by the war, and its social outlook has been completely renewed. It is now riding the Chollima, building a beautiful socialist society without exploitation, poverty, or hunger.
    However, in South Korea, the situation is completely the opposite. The people of South Korea have no democracy or freedom. The Syngman Rhee clique even wants to sell South Korean overseas Chinese as slaves. Not only that, but U.S. imperialism has repeatedly violated the armistice agreement, continuously expanding the Syngman Rhee puppet army, and even wants to transport atomic weapons into South Korea, turning South Korea into a base for atomic warfare.
    If the Korean issue is not resolved peacefully, it will be difficult to achieve lasting peace in the Far East and Asia. The United States military must withdraw from South Korea immediately. All provocations against the Korean people and sinister conspiracies against the people of Asian countries will be smashed to pieces by the iron fists of the Korean people, the Chinese people, and all peace-loving people in the world. If you do not learn your lesson, history is ruthless, so just wait and see!

    历史无情
    梅兰芳
    我要严厉地谴责美帝国主义企图长期霸占南朝鲜的恶毒阴谋。大家知道，朝鲜停战以来已经历了六个年头了，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府一向坚持和平统一祖国的原则，我们中国人民志愿军也忠实地遵循了和平解决朝鲜问题的正确方针，并且在去年志愿军已全部撤出朝鲜。当1953年，朝鲜停战协定刚签订时，我曾去过朝鲜一次，在不少地区亲眼看见过遭到战争破坏的惨状，以及美帝在朝鲜北部所犯下的血腥罪行，侵略者这样蛮干，丝毫没有减弱朝鲜北部人民的昂扬斗志，而正义终于战胜了暴力。但是六年来，朝鲜北部在朝鲜劳动党的正确领导下，已经迅速地恢复了被战争破坏了的国民经济，社会面貌焕然一新，正在跨上千里马，建设一个没有剥削、不存在贫困、饥饿的美好的社会主义社会。
    然而，在南朝鲜，情况却完全相反，南朝鲜人民没有任何的民主与自由，李承晚集团甚至要把南朝鲜的侨民当作奴隶贩卖。不但如此，美帝国主义还一再破坏停战协定，不断扩充李承晚傀儡军队，还要把原子武器运进南朝鲜，把南朝鲜变为原子战争基地。
    朝鲜问题如果得不到和平解决，要实现远东与亚洲的持久和平是很困难的。美国军队必须迅速从南朝鲜撤退，一切对朝鲜人民的挑衅与亚洲各国人民为敌的罪恶阴谋，一定要在朝鲜人民、中国人民及全世界爱好和平人民的铁拳回击下打得头破血流。如果你们不接受教训，历史是无情的，那就等着瞧吧！
