Grasp Tightly From the Beginning, Grasp Tightly From Beginning to End
Lezhi County Uses Summer Bumper Harvest Experience to Promote Autumn Production

Chengdu, June 29th (Our Dispatch) - Lezhi County, Sichuan Province, which achieved a great wheat harvest, has promptly applied its wheat field management experience to spring production. The county's spring crop field management work is meticulous and down-to-earth, and rice, corn, cotton, and other crops are growing well over large areas.

This year, Lezhi County's 190,000 mu of wheat generally achieved a bumper harvest. Cadres and the masses throughout the county have accumulated valuable experience in everything from leadership methods to production techniques. One important lesson learned from wheat field management was: "Grasp tightly from the beginning, and grasp tightly from beginning to end." Based on this experience, nearly 3,000 field management professional teams were formed throughout the county at the start of spring planting, responsible for management all the way from planting to nurturing, from nurturing to the green stage, from the green stage to maturity, and from maturity to harvest. As soon as planting was completed, field management activities were fully launched. More than 36,000 mu of early rice, a month after transplanting, has mostly been top-dressed twice and cultivated and weeded twice, and large areas of high-yield fields have now begun a third top-dressing; more than 220,000 mu of mid-season rice has generally been top-dressed once and cultivated and weeded once, and high-yield areas are undergoing a second top-dressing and weeding.

In response to some problems that may arise from the dense planting of rice this year, especially the problem of lodging, various localities are drawing on the experience of preventing wheat lodging and starting to prevent it from the seedling stage. The county's cadres visited Anyue County, the competition's opponent, four times, and each time they returned from exchanging experiences, new ideas emerged in field management work. After the spring crops were planted, the Lezhi County Party Committee launched a county-wide evaluation and inspection and began a spring production friendship competition with neighboring counties. Through these activities, the slackening thoughts of some cadres and the masses were quickly eliminated. The county's farmers, without removing their armor and without stopping their horses, immediately devoted themselves to eliminating third-class seedlings. Recent inspections and evaluations in various localities show that Longxi Commune, bordering Anyue County, Hongqi Commune's Tailai Management District, bordering Suining County, Xiangquan Commune, bordering Mianyang County, and Renhe Commune, bordering Ziyang County, have all been rated as advanced spring production units.

Lezhi County has learned from its wheat experience and continues to engage in "command fields" in spring production management. These command fields often cover dozens or even hundreds of mu of land. In wheat production management, they effectively promoted the movement for large-scale high yields. This time, in spring production management, the communes have further expanded the command fields. The county has more than 40,000 mu of command fields for rice alone; other crops such as cotton and corn also have command fields of considerable size. Cadres at all levels participate in production and lead production through these command fields, discovering and solving problems in a timely manner, making field management work lively and vigorous.

    一开始就抓紧  自始至终抓紧
    乐至县用夏季丰产经验推动秋季生产
    本报成都29日电　四川省获得小麦大丰收的乐至县，及时把小麦田间管理的经验运用到大春生产。全县大春作物田间管理工作做得细致踏实，有声有色，水稻、玉米、棉花等作物大面积生长良好。
    今年乐至县种植的十九万亩小麦，普遍获得丰收。全县干部和群众从领导方法到生产技术都积累了许多宝贵经验。在小麦田间管理工作中取得的一个重要经验是：“一开始就抓紧，自始至终都抓紧”。根据这项经验，大春栽种开始，全县就成立了近三千个田间管理专业队，由种护到生，由生护到青，由青护到老，由老护到收，负责管理到底。栽种工作一结束，田间管理活动即全面展开。三万六千多亩早稻，栽插过后一个月，大多数已追肥两次，中耕除草两次，大面积高产田现已开始第三次追肥；二十二万多亩中稻，已普遍追肥一次，中耕除草一次，高产片正在进行第二次追肥和除草。
    各地对今年水稻密植后可能出现的一些问题，特别是倒伏问题，参照小麦防倒的经验，从苗期就动手防止。该县干部曾四次到竞赛的对方安岳县去参观，每次交流经验回来，田间管理工作都要出现一些新气象。大春作物栽插结束后，中共乐至县委即在全县开展了一次评比大检查，并和邻近各县展开大春生产友谊竞赛。通过这些活动，迅速扫除了部分干部和群众的松劲思想，全县农民人不卸甲，马不停蹄，立即投入消灭三类苗的活动。最近各地检查评比结果，与安岳县接壤的龙溪公社，与遂宁县接壤的红旗公社太来管理区，与绵阳县接壤的香泉公社，与资阳县接壤的人和公社，都被评为大春生产先进单位。
    乐至县吸取小麦的经验，在大春生产管理中继续大搞指挥田。这些指挥田常常拥有数十亩乃至数百亩田土，在小麦生产管理中，有效地推动了大面积高产运动。这次大春生产管理中，各公社进一步扩大了指挥田，全县仅水稻一项共有指挥田四万多亩；其他棉花玉米等作物也都建立有规模可观的指挥田。各级干部通过这些指挥田，参加生产领导生产，发现问题及时解决，使田间管理工作做得生动活泼。　（刘宗棠）
