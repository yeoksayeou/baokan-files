In Chengguan People's Commune, Huaxian County, Henan Province, I saw a group photo of two young girls. It was written on it: "Souvenir of the Two Sisters of Nan and Bei Weitan". They were about the same age, both smiling so naturally, leaning close together, truly like a pair of the best sisters. These two girls are both captains of the paddy rice professional teams in Chengguan People's Commune, Huaxian County. One is called Guo Aimei, twenty years old this year, and the other is Jiao Lianying, nineteen years old this year. They went to junior high school together. Last spring, the Party called for changing low-lying areas to grow paddy rice. They responded to the Party's call together. Guo Aimei led Nan Weitan, and Jiao Lianying led Bei Weitan.

Speaking of Nan and Bei Weitan, everyone in Chengguan, Huaxian County, knows that they are notorious "annoyances." According to legend, many years ago, it was originally the most fertile land. Since one year, two dragons emerged in what is now Nan Weitan. They fought fiercely, and thus it became two large water pools in a vast expanse. Since then, in this thousands of acres of land, only messy reeds have grown.

After a year of hard work, last autumn, the appearance of these two reed pools changed. The endless golden rice fields aroused the admiration of passersby, and people came to visit from all directions. The 550 mu of rice fields in Nan Weitan yielded an average of 1,270 jin per mu at harvest time. Although the area converted to rice cultivation in Bei Weitan was not as large as that in Nan Weitan, it created a high-yield record of an average yield of 4,321 jin per mu. Jiao Lianying also gloriously participated in the National Congress of Active Women. The resounding slogan of "Learn from Nan Weitan, Catch up with Bei Weitan" spread everywhere, and the Party and government leading organs at all levels from the special zone to the county have been praising them. Amidst this universal praise, the minds of Jiao Lianying and Guo Aimei became somewhat dizzy. Guo Aimei believed that Nan Weitan's conversion to paddy rice was a large-area bumper harvest and looked down on Bei Weitan. Jiao Lianying felt that their yield was high, and they were not convinced by each other, secretly planning in their hearts: they must suppress their opponents in future competitions. Throughout the winter, in the competition of deep plowing and repairing field projects, they often secretly sent people to the other side to do "reconnaissance"; but they themselves were as careful as guarding against pickpockets, fearing that they would be caught off guard and the other side would figure out their bottom line.

When this erroneous tendency just emerged, the Party General Branch of the brigade and the Party Committee of the Commune discovered that the thinking of both sides was not right, and quickly reported the situation to the County Party Committee. At that time, some advocated immediately organizing a criticism of this erroneous thinking, but Zhang Xiangli, the secretary of the County Party Committee in charge of rice production, firmly opposed doing so. He emphasized that they must patiently enlighten and guide them, take good care of and promote their positive and upward side, and help them consciously abandon the individualistic elements in their thinking. According to Zhang Xiangli's opinion, the Party Committee of the Commune carried out a series of work for Guo Aimei and Jiao Lianying, which made them undergo significant changes in their thinking. However, the most profound education for them was a conversation between County Party Secretary Zhang Xiangli and them.

One evening, Comrade Zhang Xiangli went to Chengguan to inspect work. He convened a symposium with Jiao Lianying, Guo Aimei, and several technicians from Nan and Bei Weitan. The young people scrambled to report to the County Party Secretary their production plans for this year and their determination to strive for the first place and go to Beijing to see Chairman Mao. "It is a good thing to strive for the first place!" Secretary Zhang said with a smile, "But do you know how many kinds of first places there are?" This sudden question stunned the young men and women present, and people were trying to figure out what the County Party Secretary meant. "Let me tell you a story first," Comrade Zhang Xiangli continued: "Two students were racing, one in front and one behind. Later, the person running behind worked hard to catch up; although both of them used all their strength, neither could leave the other behind by a single step, and they ran side by side for a long time. Suddenly, one of them tripped over something on the ground and was about to fall, and it was almost near the finish line. In such a situation, do you think it is better to pull up the one who is about to fall, or just run forward to strive for the first place?" "Naturally, we should pull up the one who is about to fall!" "That's right! At that time, the person running beside him, without hesitation, pulled up his opponent, and the two ran towards the finish line together. Therefore, in this race, there were two first places!" Comrade Zhang Xiangli paused here, and then said: "In fact, in the current flourishing socialist construction cause, why is it just a 'double first'? We should have hundreds, thousands, and tens of thousands of first places!"

Secretary Zhang's remarks deeply moved everyone present. That night, Guo Aimei and Jiao Lianying lay in bed, tossing and turning, unable to fall asleep for a long time. The next morning, the two of them automatically got together to conduct mutual self-criticisms, and immediately formulated a competition plan for mutual help and common improvement. In order to commemorate the rebirth of their pure friendship, they specially went to the photo studio to take a group photo and wrote on it: "Souvenir of the Two Sisters of Nan and Bei Weitan".

Spring has put on new clothes for the earth, and the season for raising seedlings has arrived. According to the deployment of the County Party Committee's Rice Office, based on the lesson that raising seedlings too late last year delayed the transplanting time, resulting in labor shortages, this year it was decided to advance the paddy rice seedling raising season by about a month compared to last year. This is truly a new subject. Especially for Guo Aimei and Jiao Lianying, who only have one year of experience in growing paddy rice, with the ground temperature only around ten degrees, what should be used to cover it to make the temperature suitable for the growth of rice seedlings? In order to break through this problem, Guo Aimei and Jiao Lianying have researched and experimented together more than once. They have experimented with almost all methods, such as raising seedlings with warm water, raising seedlings with oiled paper windows, and raising seedlings with glass windows. Finally, they found the most suitable method. Every day, the two of them have to check the seedling beds one by one. Whether in Nan Weitan or Bei Weitan, and no matter who it is, as long as they see a problem, they frankly point it out. For example, once, Jiao Lianying saw in Nan Weitan that some seedling beds were not watered enough, and some seeds dried out after germination. She immediately suggested to Guo Aimei that these seedling beds should be watered quickly. Once, after it rained, some of the oiled paper windows on the seedling beds were broken by the rain. Jiao Lianying thought that the weather had warmed up and there was no need to paste oiled paper windows anymore. After conducting experiments, Guo Aimei found that the ground temperature of the pasted oiled paper windows was 30 degrees, while the temperature of those not pasted was only more than ten degrees. She immediately told Jiao Lianying about this experimental result and asked her to quickly restore the paper windows. Last year, Nan Weitan did a comparative test of eleven varieties, while Bei Weitan did not. This year, Guo Aimei took the initiative to tell Jiao Lianying to give some to Bei Weitan. Even the precious seeds, totaling only dozens of plants, that they hybridized from sorghum and paddy rice last year, were divided in half to Bei Weitan. And as soon as the land leveling machine developed by Jiao Lianying and the others was successfully trial-produced, they sent the blueprints to Nan Weitan.

When reporters went to visit these two girls, they were in a paddy field in Bei Weitan, teaching the rice transplanting contestants of the two professional teams to practice transplanting together. The spring breeze rippled the water in the paddy fields, and a burst of singing came from afar:

North and South Weitan are like brothers, respecting, loving, and learning from each other,
You respect me and I respect you, ten thousand catties per mu without effort.
Ten thousand catties pool, will be realized, compete for top honors in front of Tiananmen.

Guo Aimei and Jiao Lianying achieved great results in last year's labor competition and were praised by the masses.
However, amidst the universal praise, they became somewhat dizzy. They were wary of each other and unconvinced by each other.
At a symposium, County Party Secretary Zhang Xiangli adopted an enlightening and guiding method to educate them.
The words of the County Party Secretary made them wake up. Based on the new friendship, a heated competition began again.

    两姐妹竞赛
    阚枫文　苗地画
    在河南滑县城关人民公社，我看见一张两个年轻姑娘的合影。上面写着：“南、北苇潭两姐妹留念”。她们的年岁都差不多，都笑得那样自然，紧紧地靠着，真像一对最要好的姐妹。这两个姑娘都是滑县城关人民公社的水稻专业队的队长。一个叫郭爱美，今年二十岁，一个叫焦莲英。今年十九岁。她们一道上过高小。去年春天，党号召在低洼地区改种水稻，她们又一道响应了党的号召，郭爱美领导南苇潭，焦莲英领导北苇潭。
    提起南、北苇潭，滑县城关人都知道：是有名的“人人烦”。据传说：在若干年前，那里本是一片最肥沃的土地，自从有一年在现在的南苇潭那地方，出了两条龙，它俩恶斗一场，于是，就变成了一片汪洋的两个大水潭。从此，在这几千亩大的地方，只生长着一些杂乱的苇子。
    经过一年的苦战，去年秋天，这两个苇潭的面貌改观了，一望无边的金黄色稻田引起了过路人的惊羡，四处来参观的人络绎不绝。南苇潭的五百五十亩稻田，收获时平均每亩收了一千二百七十斤，北苇潭改种的面积虽然没有南苇潭的大，但创造了平均亩产四千三百二十一斤的高产纪录。焦莲英并且光荣地参加了全国妇女积极分子代表大会。到处传来了“学南苇潭、赶北苇潭”的响亮口号，从专区到县各级党政领导机关也一直都在表扬她们。在这到处一片叫好声中，焦莲英和郭爱美的头脑有些昏昏然了。郭爱美认为南苇潭改种水稻的面积是大面积丰产，看不起北苇潭，焦莲英觉得她们的产量高，而互不服气，都暗暗地在心里盘算：一定要在今后的竞赛中把自己的对手压下去。在整个冬天以深翻土地和整修田间工程的竞赛中，她们经常偷偷地派人到对方去做“侦探”；而自己却像防范扒手一样严谨，唯恐一时不留心，被对方摸清了底。
    当这种错误倾向刚露头，大队的党总支和公社党委会便发觉双方的思想不对头，并且很快把这一情况汇报给了县委。当时，有的主张要立即组织对这种错误思想的批判，主管水稻生产的县委书记处书记张相礼同志却坚决反对这样做。他强调指出：一定要耐心地启发和诱导她们，很好地爱护和发扬她们积极和向上的一面，帮助她们自觉地抛弃思想上的个人主义因素。按照张相礼同志的意见，公社党委会向郭爱美和焦莲英进行了一系列的工作，使她们在思想上有了显著的转变。但是，对她们教育最深刻的还是县委书记张相礼同志和她们的一席谈话。
    一天晚上，张相礼同志到城关检查工作。他召开了一个有焦莲英、郭爱美和南、北苇潭的几个技术员参加的座谈会。青年们都争抢着向县委书记汇报他们今年的生产计划和一定要力争第一，到北京去见毛主席的决心。“要争第一这是一件好事情啊！”张书记微笑着说：“可是你们知道，有几个第一吗？”这个突如其来的问题，把在场的小伙子和姑娘们都怔住了，人门都在极力揣测县委书记的意思。“还是让我先讲一个故事吧，”张相礼同志接着说：“有两个学生赛跑，一前一后，后来，跑在后面的那个人用劲追了上来；尽管两人都使足了力气，谁也不能撇下谁一步，就这样并肩跑了很长一段。忽然，有一个不知被地面上的什么东西绊了一下，眼看就要摔倒了，这时已经快要跑近终点了。在这样的情况下，你们说，是要把那个快要摔倒的拉起来对呢，还是只顾向前跑去争第一好呢？”“那自然应该把那快要摔倒的人拉起来！”“对！就在那时，跑在他身边的人，毫不迟疑地把他的对手拉起来，两人双双跑向终点。于是，在这场赛跑里，便出了两个第一！”张相礼同志说到这里，顿了一下，又说：“其实，在当前蓬勃的社会主义建设事业里，又何尝只是‘双第一’呢？我们应该有成百、成千、成万个第一！”
    张书记的这段谈话深深地打动了到会的每个人的心。当天晚上，郭爱美和焦莲英两人躺在床上，都翻来复去的，很久没有睡着。第二天清早，两人便自动到一起互相进行了检查，当场订出了互相帮助共同提高的竞赛计划。为了表示纪念她们这个纯真的友谊的新生，他们特地到照像馆里去合照了一张照片，在上面写着：“南、北苇潭姐妹留念”。
    春天给大地换上了新装，育秧季节来到了。根据县委水稻办公室的布置，根据去年育秧过晚，拖迟了插秧时间，因而造成了劳力紧张的教训，今年确定把水稻的育秧季节比去年提前一个月左右。这真是一个新课题。特别是郭爱美和焦莲英，她们种水稻才只有一年的经验，在地面温度只有十度上下的情况下，究竟用什么东西覆盖，才能使温度适宜于稻秧的生长？为了突破这个难题，郭爱美和焦莲英不只一次地在一块研究，试验，什么用温水育苗啊，油纸窗育苗啊，玻璃窗育苗啊，几乎所有的办法都试验遍了，最后终于找出了最适当的方法。每天，她俩都要一道挨个苗床检查，不论在南苇潭，还是北苇潭，也不管是谁，只要一看出问题，就坦率地提出来。例如，有一次，焦莲英在南苇潭看到有些苗床里因为灌水过少，有的种子发芽后，又被太阳晒干了。她立刻向郭爱美提出在这些苗床里要很快灌水。一次，下雨后，有些苗床上的油纸窗被雨打烂了。焦莲英以为现在天气已经转暖，可以不必再糊油纸窗了。郭爱美在进行试验后，发现糊好油纸窗的地面温度三十度，没糊的才十多度，立刻把这个试验结果告诉了焦莲英，要她赶快把纸窗恢复起来。去年，南苇潭做了十一个品种的对比试验，而北苇潭没有，今年，郭爱美便主动向焦莲英说要分一些给北苇潭。就连她们在去年用高粱和水稻授粉杂交成的总共只有几十棵的珍贵的种子，也分出了一半给北苇潭。而焦莲英她们研究成的土地平整机，刚试制成功，便把图纸送给了南苇潭。
    当记者去访问这两个姑娘时，她们正在北苇潭的一块稻田里，一道教这两个专业队的插秧选手们练习插秧。春风吹绉了稻田里的水，远处传来一阵阵地歌声：
    南北苇潭亲兄弟，互敬互爱互学习，
    你敬俺来俺敬你，亩产万斤不费力。
    万斤潭，定实现，天安门前比状元。（附图片）
    郭爱美和焦莲英在去年的劳动竞赛中，都取得了巨大成绩，受到群众称赞。
    但是，她俩在一片叫好声中，头脑有些昏昏然了。相互戒备，相互不服气。
    在一次座谈会上，县委书记张相礼采取启发和诱导的方法，向她们进行教育。
    县委书记的话，使她们猛省过来。在新的友谊基础上，又开始了热火朝天的竞赛。
