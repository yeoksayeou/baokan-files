    "That Thing…"
    Qin Li

    Last year, the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League called on children across the country to engage in three activities, one of which was to promote Putonghua (Mandarin Chinese). The children enthusiastically and persistently studied Putonghua. Even in regions like Fujian, Guizhou, and Guangdong, many Young Pioneers spoke fluent Beijing dialect, which is indeed a gratifying and commendable thing.

    What about adults? Are their achievements better than the children's? This is a question worth asking ourselves.

    Recently, I had the opportunity to accompany a group of international friends on a visit to other places. I deeply felt that it is necessary to first advocate the promotion of Putonghua among the leaders of our grassroots units. In Sichuan, the vice-chairman of a People's Commune, when introducing the situation of the commune, spoke Sichuan dialect very quickly, which already made the interpreter feel embarrassed. When we arrived in Shanghai and Guangzhou, and visited some factories, it was necessary to go through two layers of translation: first, the Shanghai dialect or Cantonese was translated into Putonghua, and then the interpreter translated it into a foreign language. A person in charge of a factory in Shanghai, when introducing a new technical measure, repeatedly said "狄格末事" ("di ge mo shi"—"this thing"), and the interpreter mistakenly thought it was a foreign translation.

    In our Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture, the unity of the people has been strengthened, and exchanges have become closer. Don't we often see visiting groups from other provinces and counties? In this situation, language, as a means of expressing thoughts, its role becomes increasingly important, and eliminating the barriers caused by dialects becomes even more urgent. "狄格末事" is really a bad "thing"! I think it won't be more difficult for grassroots leading comrades to take the lead in promoting Putonghua than it is for children, right?

    “狄格末事……”
    秦犁
    共青团中央在去年曾经号召全国少年儿童搞三项活动，其中一项就是推广普通话。孩子们热情地、坚持不懈地学习普通话，连福建、贵州、广东这样的地区，都出现许多满口流利的北京话的少先队员，这实在是个可喜可贺的好事。
    成年人怎么样呢？成绩是不是比孩子们好些？这是值得大家反躬自问一下的问题。
    最近我有机会陪一批国际友人到外地访问，深感到有必要首先在我们的一些基层单位的领导人中，提倡一下推广普通话。在四川，介绍人民公社情况的副社长，川西话说得很快，翻译同志已经感到为难；及至到了上海和广州，参观一些工厂时，就必须通过两重翻译：先把上海话或广州话译成普通话，再由翻译同志译成外文。上海一个工厂负责人在介绍一项新的技术措施的时候，一连说了好几个“狄格末事”（“这个东西”），翻译同志竟误以为是一个外文的译名。
    我们工农业的大跃进中，人民群众的团结增强了，交流也更密切了。我们不是经常发现来自外省外县的参观团吗？在这种时候，作为表达思想的语言，它的作用也就一天天显得重要，消除由于方言所造成的隔阂，也就更加迫切。“狄格末事”，实在是个不妙的“末事”！基层领导同志以身作则，带头推广普通话，我想，未必会比孩子们更困难吧？
