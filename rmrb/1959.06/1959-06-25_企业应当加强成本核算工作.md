Enterprises' product costs include raw material consumption, wages, management fees, etc. The reduction of product costs means the increase of labor productivity, the saving of raw material consumption, and the reduction of enterprise management expenses and non-productive expenditures, that is, producing more and better products with the same labor and materials. Cost accounting is an important part of economic accounting. Strengthening cost accounting can prompt enterprises to further improve business management, vigorously increase production and practice economy, tap internal potential, and fully and rationally use human, material, and financial resources, so as to obtain the greatest production results with the least consumption, and fully implement the construction policy of more, faster, better, and more economical. At the same time, by strengthening cost accounting, key problems and weak links in production and management can be discovered in time, so that measures can be taken to solve them and promote further development of production. With the continuous development of production and the continuous reduction of costs, more funds can be accumulated for the country, thereby providing important conditions for accelerating socialist construction. At present, emphasizing further strengthening cost accounting work is of great significance for promoting the development of the production increase and economy practice movement.

In order to further improve cost accounting work, according to the experience of various regions and enterprises and my experience in work, the following points should be noted:

Reducing Costs Requires Developing Production

We must start with developing production to reduce costs and closely integrate cost accounting with the development of production, and promote the development of production with all our strength by strengthening cost accounting. This is the fundamental direction of cost accounting work. To carry out cost accounting work in isolation, accounting for the sake of accounting, and not actively promoting production increase and economy practice, cost accounting work has no foundation; only focusing on production and not paying attention to accounting costs will cause waste and is not conducive to the development of production. Only by closely combining the two and promoting each other can production be developed in a more, faster, better, and more economical way, and costs can be further reduced. The achievements made by enterprises in Zigong City in 1958 in reducing costs by starting with production fully illustrate this point. Last year, as a result of mobilizing the masses to carry out technical innovation and technical revolution, improving labor productivity, and saving and comprehensively utilizing raw materials, the cost of the main product—crude salt—was reduced by 37.05% compared with 1957. Among them, the reduction rate in December 1958 reached 53.49%. The plan to reduce costs by 50% in three years was achieved two years ahead of schedule. Their experience should be summarized and promoted. In the future, financial and accounting personnel of enterprises at all levels must closely combine with production, promptly address key problems and weak links in production, and strengthen cost analysis work by providing analysis data through accounting, so as to promote the development of production and further reduce product costs.

At present, the main method of developing production is to strive to improve labor productivity. The improvement of labor productivity means the further development of the production potential of enterprises and the great saving of live labor and materialized labor. That is to say, the same amount of labor produces more and better products in the same amount of time. In this way, the cost of the product will be greatly reduced. Therefore, we must continue to vigorously carry out technical innovation and technical revolution, fully tap the potential of enterprise equipment, and strive to improve labor productivity; at the same time, we must also mobilize the masses to improve process design, improve operation methods, develop comprehensive utilization, adopt substitutes, save the use of raw materials, and reduce enterprise management costs and other non-productive expenditures.

In order to reduce costs, we must pay great attention to product quality. Quality and quantity are unified. Poor quality will inevitably affect quantity and cause waste. Therefore, cost reduction measures can only and must be carried out under the principle of not reducing product quality. At the same time, tapping the potential of equipment must pay attention to the maintenance of equipment; the improvement of labor productivity should mainly be to mobilize the masses to vigorously carry out technical innovation and technical revolution, rather than mainly relying on increasing labor intensity; while increasing production, we must pay attention to the lives of employees, especially safety. Only by reducing costs in this way is it a real cost reduction.

Improve Management Systems to Promote Accounting Work

In order to strengthen cost accounting, it is necessary to establish and improve necessary cost management systems. In the rectification movement, under the leadership of the Party, the broad masses of workers eliminated many outdated rules and regulations that were unfavorable to the development of production, which powerfully promoted cost accounting work. In the future, this spirit should be further carried forward, and the outdated rules and regulations should continue to be reformed. However, after some enterprises have broken through the old, some new and necessary rules and regulations have not been established in time, so that the division of production costs, basic construction investment, four expenses (technical organization measures fees, trial production fees for new types of products, miscellaneous basic construction expenditures, labor safety protection fees), and operating expenses is not clear enough, which affects the accuracy of cost calculation. Some financial cadres do not have enough understanding of the role of planning management and quota management in cost accounting, and fail to submit accounting statements and make full use of these statements in accordance with regulations, which also affects the further strengthening of accounting work. In the future, in addition to continuing to reform those rules and regulations that should be broken but have not been broken or broken thoroughly, we should, in the spirit of being conducive to production and easy for the masses to master, adopt the method of mass line to establish and improve financial cost management systems and accounting methods that are in line with actual conditions, and issue cost indicators level by level, compile and approve cost plans, so that the indicators are implemented and rooted. At the same time, we should also, on the basis of mobilizing the masses to discuss, formulate necessary quotas related to cost accounting, divide the scope of cost expenses, strengthen planning management, and focus on the compilation, reporting, analysis and research of enterprise accounting statements, so as to make cost accounting more detailed and specific.

Everyone Cares About Costs, Everyone Is Thrifty

The basic method of doing a good job in cost accounting is to continue to implement the mass line on the basis of strengthening centralized leadership and strengthening departmental work. Because cost accounting work itself has broad mass character, it is necessary to implement the mass line working method and closely combine mass accounting and professional accounting in order to do a good job in cost accounting. The experience of many enterprises proves that carrying out mass-based economic accounting in work teams is an important part of implementing the mass line in cost accounting work. The work team is the front line of production. The implementation of economic accounting in the work team can not only further integrate accounting work with production activities, so that economic accounting is implemented and rooted, and plays a better role in promoting production, but also enriches the content of workers' participation in enterprise management, further strengthens the cost accounting thinking and saving concept of employees, enhances the sense of responsibility as masters of their own affairs, and comprehensively implements the policy of running enterprises diligently and thriftily and in a more, faster, better and more economical way, forming a vigorous mass movement of "everyone cares about costs and everyone is thrifty". The content of work team accounting should be determined by mobilizing the masses to discuss according to the specific conditions of the enterprise and the main key and weak links in production and cost in each period. It should be simple and easy to implement and not too complicated. In order to better promote the broad masses of employees to care about production costs, cost reduction indicators should also be issued to factories and mines at all levels and announced to the masses, mobilizing the masses to come up with ideas and propose measures to strive to ensure realization. While carrying out work team accounting, workshop accounting and factory accounting should continue to be strengthened. It must be recognized that the work team is not a comprehensive accounting unit, and work team accounting is only a part of enterprise accounting and workshop accounting. The enterprise is the comprehensive accounting unit. Therefore, we should mainly focus on enterprise accounting, and combine unified leadership with mobilizing the masses to fully reflect and assess the entire production activities of the enterprise. After the decentralization of financial power and the development of mass accounting, the tasks of the enterprise finance and accounting department are still very arduous. It is not only responsible for uniformly planning and managing the cost accounting work of the entire enterprise, analyzing the cost situation of the entire workshop and the entire enterprise, but also guiding the workers and the masses to familiarize themselves with accounting procedures, and promptly summarizing the experience in mass accounting, discovering problems, and solving them in a timely manner. Therefore, the work of the enterprise finance and accounting department must be greatly strengthened.

While carrying out mass cost accounting, mass cost analysis work must also be carried out. Accounting and analysis should be closely combined, and accounting data should be fully utilized for analysis to expose contradictions, resolve contradictions, find out experience, promote experience, and promote the development of production in a more, faster, better, and more economical way and the continuous reduction of costs. Many enterprises have created a variety of cost analysis methods in practice, such as on-site analysis, special analysis, "movement" analysis (combining analysis with central movement), and "trend" analysis (analyzing the trend of cost increases and decreases), and adopted popular methods such as jingles, big-character posters, and blackboards to publicize to the masses, achieving clear focus, easy understanding, and good results. Some enterprises conduct cost analysis, seeing both things and people, calculating both economic accounts and political accounts, analyzing both economic reasons and ideological reasons, adding new content to cost analysis and better combining economic work with political work. These experiences should continue to be promoted and improved.

    企业应当加强成本核算工作
    彭伯诚
    企业产品成本包括原材料消耗、工资、管理费等。产品成本的降低，意味着劳动生产率的提高、原材料消耗量的节约、企业管理费用和非生产性开支的降低，也就是说，用同样的劳动和物资生产出更多更好的产品。成本核算是经济核算的重要一环，加强成本核算就可以促使企业进一步改善经营管理，厉行增产节约，挖掘内部潜力，充分合理地使用人力、物力、财力，从而以最小的消耗取得最大的生产成果，全面贯彻多快好省的建设方针。同时，通过加强成本核算，又可以及时发现生产上、管理上的关键问题和薄弱环节，以便采取措施加以解决，推动生产的进一步发展。随着生产的不断发展和成本的不断降低，就能为国家积累更多的资金，从而为加速社会主义建设提供了重要的条件。在目前，强调进一步加强成本核算工作，对于促进增产节约运动的开展更具有十分重要的意义。
    为了进一步作好成本核算工作，根据各地区、各企业的经验和我在工作中的体会，应当注意以下几点：
    发展生产要降低成本
    必须从发展生产入手来降低成本，把成本核算与发展生产密切结合起来，通过加强成本核算，全力促进生产的发展。这是成本核算工作的根本方向。孤立地进行成本核算工作，为核算而核算，不积极促进增产节约，成本核算工作就没有基础；只抓生产不注意核算成本，就会造成浪费，不利于生产的发展。只有使二者密切结合，互相促进，多快好省地发展生产，成本也就可以进一步降低。1958年，自贡市各企业从生产入手来降低成本所取得的成绩，就充分说明了这一点。去年，这个市由于发动群众大闹技术革新和技术革命，提高劳动生产率，节约和综合利用原材料的结果，使主要产品——原盐的成本，较1957年降低了37.05％。其中1958年12月份的降低率达到53.49％。提前两年实现了原订三年降低成本50％的计划。他们的经验，应当加以总结推广。今后各级企业的财会人员，必须紧密结合生产，及时针对生产上的关键问题和薄弱环节，通过核算提供分析资料，加强成本分析工作，以促进生产的发展，使产品成本进一步降低。
    当前，发展生产的主要方法是努力提高劳动生产率。劳动生产率的提高，意味着企业生产潜力的进一步发挥，活劳动与物化劳动的大大节省。也就是说，使同样多的劳动在同样的时间内生产出更多更好的产品。这样，产品的成本也就会大大降低。因此，必须继续大闹技术革新和技术革命，充分发掘企业设备潜力，努力提高劳动生产率；同时，还要发动群众，改进工艺设计，改进操作方法，发展综合利用，采用代用品，节约使用原材料，降低企业管理费用和其他非生产性开支。
    为了降低成本，必须十分注意产品质量。质和量是统一的，质不好必然影响量而且还要造成浪费。因此，降低成本的措施，都只能而且必须在不降低产品质量的原则下进行。同时，发掘设备潜力必须注意设备的保养维修；提高劳动生产率，主要应是发动群众大闹技术革新和技术革命，而主要不是靠提高劳动强度；在增加生产的同时，必须注意职工生活，尤其要注意安全。只有这样去降低成本，才是真正的降低成本。
    健全管理制度推动核算工作
    为了加强成本核算，必须建立和健全必要的成本管理制度。在整风运动中，广大职工在党的领导下，破除了许多不利于发展生产的陈规旧制，有力地推动了成本核算工作。今后还应当进一步发扬这种精神，对过了时的规章制度继续加以改革。但是，有的企业在大破之后，一些新的必要的规章制度还未及时建立起来，以致生产费用、基本建设投资、四项费用（技术组织措施费、新种类产品试制费、零星基本建设支出、劳动安全保护费）、事业费等的划分不够清楚，影响了成本计算的精确性。有的财务干部对于成本核算中计划管理与定额管理的作用认识不够，未能按照规定报送会计报表和充分利用这些报表，也影响了核算工作的进一步加强。今后，除了继续对那些该破而没有破或破得不彻底的规章制度加以改革外，应当本着有利于生产和便于群众掌握的原则，采取群众路线的方法，建立和健全符合于实际情况的财务成本管理制度和核算方法，逐级下达成本指标，编报和审批成本计划，使指标落实扎根。同时，还应当在发动群众讨论的基础上，制定必要的有关成本核算的定额，划分成本费用范围，加强计划管理，抓紧企业会计报表的编报和分析研究工作，使成本核算更加细致、具体。
    人人关心成本  个个精打细算
    作好成本核算工作的基本方法是在加强集中领导和加强部门工作的基础上继续贯彻群众路线。由于成本核算工作本身就具有广泛的群众性，因此，必须贯彻群众路线的工作方法，把群众核算和专业核算密切结合起来，才能把成本核算工作作好。许多企业的经验证明，开展群众性的班组经济核算，是成本核算工作贯彻群众路线的重要一环。班组是生产的第一线，班组实行经济核算，不仅可以使核算工作进一步与生产活动紧密结合，使经济核算落实扎根，更好地起到促进生产的作用，而且可以丰富工人参加企业管理的内容，进一步加强职工的成本核算思想和节约观点，提高当家作主的责任感，全面地贯彻勤俭办企业和多快好省的方针，形成一个“人人关心成本、个个精打细算”轰轰烈烈的群众运动。班组核算的内容，应当根据企业的具体情况，和各个时期生产上和成本上的主要关键和薄弱环节，发动群众讨论确定，要简单易行，不可过于繁琐。为了更好地促进广大职工关心生产成本，还应当将降低成本的指标层层下达到厂矿，并在群众中公布，发动群众想办法，提措施，努力保证实现。在开展班组核算的同时，车间核算与厂部核算应当继续加强。必须认识，班组不是全面核算单位，班组核算只是企业核算和车间核算的一个环节，企业才是全面核算的单位。因此，我们主要还应抓住企业核算，并把统一领导与发动群众结合起来，以全面反映和考核整个企业的生产活动。在财权下放、开展群众性核算以后，企业财会部门的任务仍然是很艰巨的。不仅要负责统一规划、统一管理整个企业的成本核算工作，分析整个车间和整个企业的成本情况，同时，还要辅导工人群众熟悉核算手续，及时总结群众核算中的经验，发现问题，及时解决。因此，企业财会部门的工作还要大大加强。
    在开展群众性成本核算的同时，还必须开展群众性的成本分析工作。使核算与分析紧密结合起来，充分利用核算资料进行分析，揭露矛盾，解决矛盾，找出经验，推广经验，促进生产多快好省地发展和成本的不断降低。许多企业在实践中创造了多种多样的成本分析方法，如现场分析、专题分析、“运动”分析（结合中心运动进行分析）、“趋势”分析（分析成本升降趋势）等，并且采取顺口溜、大字报、黑板报等群众喜闻乐见的方式向群众宣传，做到了中心明确，通俗易懂，收效很好。有些企业进行成本分析时，见物又见人，既算经济账，又算政治账，既分析经济上的原因，又分析思想上的原因，给成本分析增加了新的内容，使经济工作更好地与政治工作结合起来。这些经验，应当继续推广提高。
