Summer Harvest Vignettes

    To Allow Mothers to Participate in the Summer Harvest with Peace of Mind
    In the suburbs of Xi'an, more than 27,000 nursery staff in various communes meticulously care for over 300,000 children, allowing their mothers to participate in the summer harvest with peace of mind.
    In many communes, nursery staff not only take care of the children's meals, naps, and playtime but also wash their clothes and bathe them. Nursery staff in the Yongning Commune of Yanta District and the Baqiaopu Nursery in Baqiao District take the children to the fields on time for breastfeeding. To take good care of the children, they often work overtime, even neglecting their own meals, but everyone works very happily.

    Mobile Sales
    Among the 8,000-strong army of wheat harvesters in the Sino-German Friendship People's Commune in the suburbs of the capital, there is a mobile sales team that is very popular. They carry goods with them as they move north and south with the harvesters.
    Every day at four in the morning, the sales team starts packaging food for retail sales, and then they come to the fields with cold foods, fruits, cigarettes, and other items. As soon as the whistle blows for a break, the sales staff carry their backpacks and shoulder poles to the resting crowds, offering soda and popsicles to the thirsty and hot workers.

    Road Repair, Vehicle Building, and Granary Construction
    In order to ensure a good summer grain harvest and storage, Yanxi Commune in Changtai County, Fujian Province, launched a mass road repair, vehicle building, and granary construction campaign. By the beginning of June, the commune had repaired and newly opened 81 simple roads, cart paths, and field roads, totaling 24 *li* in length; newly built and repaired more than 530 vehicles of various types; and newly built and repaired nearly 400 warehouses.
    Thanks to road repair and vehicle building, the transportation labor force in the summer harvest will be greatly reduced, and the warehouses built by the brigades can basically meet the needs of summer grain storage.

    Red Cross Flags Planted in the Fields
    More than 80 medical personnel fighting in the wheat fields of the Nandaran Commune in Baoding City carry first aid medicines and patrol the fields, headlands, and threshing grounds. Their slogan is: "Treat the sick, and harvest wheat when not treating the sick."
    Old Chinese medicine practitioner Wang Yaosheng visited seven or eight production teams in one morning. Doctor Jia Yulin was pricked in the arm while harvesting wheat but still insisted on working. During breaks, they promoted health knowledge to the commune members. Some commune members wrote poems praising them: "Backpacks with medicine, sickles in hand, treating illness and harvesting wheat, truly good service workers for the commune members."

    Water Supply Stations and Rest Sheds
    Chenji People's Commune in Chiping County, Shandong Province, recently convened a meeting of more than 200 medical personnel, health workers, nursery staff, midwives, and cooks to propose specific measures for preventing heatstroke during the summer harvest: establishing simple men's and women's toilets, water supply stations, rest sheds, and medical stations in the fields, while also promoting common sense about preventing heatstroke to commune members, such as wearing straw hats, carrying thermoses of boiled water, and wearing light-colored clothing when going to the fields. At present, the entire commune has built 135 simple men's and women's toilets, 47 water supply stations, 81 rest sheds, and 5 field treatment stations.

    Films, Traditional Operas, and Clapper Talks
    In the summer harvest and planting campaign, Linqing City, Shandong Province, organized a literary and artistic propaganda army to be active in the fields in various forms such as clapper talks, *xiang sheng* (comic dialogue), *kuaishu* (a type of storytelling), local operas, and short dramas, according to the characteristics of busy farming labor.
    Film teams, theaters, opera troupes, and ballad troupes, in addition to performing at night, also propagandize while working during the day.

    夏收小景
    让妈妈们安心参加夏收
    西安市郊各公社的两万七千多名保育员，无微不至地照看着三十多万个儿童，使孩子们的妈妈能安心地参加夏收。
    许多公社的保育员除了照顾孩子们吃饭、午睡、玩耍以外，还给洗衣服、洗澡。雁塔区永宁公社、灞桥区灞桥堡托儿所的保育员按时抱孩子到田间喂奶；她们为了看好孩子，经常加班，甚至顾不得吃饭，但是大家工作得非常愉快。
    流动售货
    首都郊区中德友好人民公社的八千名麦收大军当中，有一支深受人们欢迎的流动售货队伍，他们带着商品随军转战南北。
    每天清早四点钟，售货队就开始分装零售的食品，然后带着冷食、水果、香烟等物品来到了田头。休息的哨子一响，售货员纷纷背包挑担来到休息的人群中间，为又渴又热的人送上汽水和冰棍。
    修路·造车·建仓
    福建长泰县岩溪公社为了使夏粮收割好、保管好，开展了群众性的修路、造车、建仓运动。到6月初，全社整修和新开的简易公路、火车路、田间大道八十一条，全长二十四里；新造和修补各种车辆五百三十多部；新盖和修理仓库近四百间。
    由于修路、造车，夏收中的运输劳动力将大大节省，各大队修盖的仓库，基本可以满足夏粮储存的需要。红十字小旗插田间
    战斗在保定市南大冉公社麦田的八十多名医务人员，携带着急救药品，巡回在田间、地头、场边。他们的口号是：“有病行医、无病割麦。”
    老中医王耀声，一个上午跑了七、八个生产队；医生贾玉林割麦时，胳臂被刺伤了，但仍然坚持工作。他们在休息时，就向社员们宣传卫生知识。有的社员编了诗歌称赞他们：“身背药，手拿镰，治病割麦都能干，真是社员的好服务员。”供水站和休息棚
    山东茌平县陈集人民公社最近召开了医务人员、保健员、保育员、接生员、炊事员二百多人的会议，对夏收中防暑工作提出具体措施：建立田间简易男女厕所、供水站、休息棚、医疗站，同时还向社员宣传下地要带草帽、带开水壶、穿淡色衣服等防暑常识。现在全公社已建男女简易厕所一百三十五个，供水站四十七个，休息棚八十一个，田间治疗站五处。
    电影·曲艺·快书
    在夏收夏种运动中，山东临清市组织文艺宣传大军，根据农忙劳动的特点，以快板、相声、快书、时调、小剧等多种形式活跃在田间。
    电影队、戏院、剧团、曲艺队除晚上演出外，白天边劳动边宣传。
    小队长变大队长

    小队长………中队长………大队长
      （为了保证快收、快打，许多机关、部队、学校的干部、官兵、学生都积极投入夏收工作）（附图片）
