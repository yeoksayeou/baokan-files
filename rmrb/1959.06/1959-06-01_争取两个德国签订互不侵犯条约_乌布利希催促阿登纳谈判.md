    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, May 30th: Walter Ulbricht, First Deputy Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, on the 29th, on behalf of the government of the German Democratic Republic, wrote to West German Chancellor Adenauer, suggesting that the two Germanies conclude a non-aggression treaty and renounce the use of force or the threat of force in relations between the two Germanies.
    On behalf of the government of the German Democratic Republic, Ulbricht suggested that the two German governments authorize their delegations at the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference to conduct preliminary negotiations on this issue to reach a preliminary agreement. The government of the German Democratic Republic will immediately grant such powers to the delegation of the German Democratic Republic headed by Foreign Minister Bolz.
    The letter stated that, out of a desire for the peaceful future of the German nation, and out of the interests of peace and easing tensions in Europe, the German Democratic Republic appeals to the Federal Republic of Germany: abandon all doubts and also grant its delegation in Geneva corresponding powers.

    争取两个德国签订互不侵犯条约
    乌布利希催促阿登纳谈判
    新华社柏林30日电　德意志民主共和国第一副总理乌布利希29日代表德意志民主共和国政府写信给西德总理阿登纳，建议两个德国缔结互不侵犯条约，在两个德国的关系中摒弃使用武力或者武力威胁。
    乌布利希代表德意志民主共和国政府建议，两个德国政府授权它们在日内瓦外长会议上的代表团就这一问题进行预备性谈判达成初步协议。德意志民主共和国政府将立即授予以外交部长博尔茨为首的德意志民主共和国代表团以这样的权力。
    信中说，从对德意志民族和平前途的愿望出发，从和平和缓和欧洲紧张局势的利益出发，德意志民主共和国向德意志联邦共和国发出呼吁：抛弃一切疑虑，也授予它在日内瓦的代表团以相应的权力。
