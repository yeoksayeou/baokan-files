Breaking Through Difficulties, Striving for a Thousand Jin Per Mu
　　Hunan's More Than 30 Counties Launch a High-Yield Movement; Masses Brave the Rain to Accumulate Fertilizer, Control Pests, and Prevent Lodging
　　Cadres at All Levels in Jiangxi Lead the Masses in Vigorously Managing Early Rice Fields to Strive for a Thousand Jin Per Mu
　　(Our Dispatch from Changsha, 7th) Hunan Province's grain high-yield movement, aiming for a thousand jin per mu, has pushed current production to a new high tide. Before the Provincial Party Committee made the decision to launch a provincial high-yield grain campaign aiming for a thousand jin, You County, Changsha, Liling, Leiyang and other counties had already launched a high-yield competition. Now, millions of people in thirty-six counties and cities across the province have enthusiastically joined the movement. Braving the rain, they go to work, accumulate and apply fertilizer, cultivate and weed, and engage in competitions.

　　On June 2, the Hunan Provincial Party Committee published an open letter to cadres throughout the province, pointing out the favorable situation for carrying out the large-scale grain high-yield movement. First, after rectification and consolidation, the People's Communes, under strengthened unified leadership, implemented hierarchical management and established operating management systems; the state procurement tasks and public accumulation ratios have been determined; and the "three guarantees and one reward" targets have been implemented. The ideological style of the vast number of cadres has been greatly improved, and they can better implement the mass line working methods in organizing commune production and life; especially after the overall arrangement of grain in the province, the rural population can eat an average of forty jin of grain per person per month, which has never happened before. Therefore, the broad masses are overjoyed and their enthusiasm is doubled. Secondly, the vast number of cadres and the masses have the rich experience of last year's Great Leap Forward, and this year's "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture is being implemented earlier and better than last year. In addition, the early and mid-season rice is currently growing vigorously, and as long as we firmly grasp field management and strive to overcome the threats of various natural disasters, we can turn the grain production increase plan into reality.

　　One of the characteristics of Hunan Province's thousand-jin high-yield movement this year is to carry out localized measures, balanced production increase, and increase the total grain output. The method is: to both grasp high-yield production on a large area, and to tightly grasp comprehensive balanced production increase; to not only increase the yield per unit area, but also to pay special attention to the increase in total output; to not only grasp the advanced, plant red flags, but also to pay attention to strengthening the leadership in backward production areas; to not only vigorously grasp grain production, but also to pay close attention to the comprehensive development of forestry, animal husbandry, fishery and sideline industries. In short, comprehensively consider, make overall plans, adapt to local conditions, make specific arrangements, everything is for producing more grain, everything is for increasing the total grain output. Based on the facts of last year's high yield and this year's favorable situation, the Hunan Provincial Party Committee requires that this year, among the 46 million mu of grain cultivated land in the province, 20 million mu should reach more than 1,000 jin per mu, and the remaining 26 million mu should reach 600, 700, or 800 jin according to different conditions. The Provincial Party Committee also requires cadres at all levels to combine soaring revolutionary vigor with a scientific spirit of analysis, so that the thousand-jin high-yield movement is built on a solid and reliable foundation.

　　The second characteristic of the movement is that under the battle cry of "ten points of target, twelve points of measures, and twenty-four points of effort," we must truly and practically grasp the measures to increase production, discuss them at all levels, and implement them at all levels. Grasping early rice well is the main link in winning a bumper harvest at present. At present, there are still about fifty days before the early rice harvest and seventy days before the mid-season rice harvest, which is the decisive stage. All localities are grasping field management with the determination to "win the day after tomorrow," breaking through the "three barriers" and winning a great grain harvest. The first barrier is the "fertilizer" barrier. Implement fertilizer in the lead, driving the overall agricultural production to leap forward. At present, there are more than 3.6 million people in the province engaged in a vigorous summer fertilizer accumulation movement, and more than 2.3 billion dan of fertilizer have been accumulated in more than twenty days. The second barrier is to prevent and control water, drought, and insect pests. June and July are the seasons when Hunan is most severely threatened by water, drought, and insect pests. Recently, it has been raining continuously for more than a month in various parts of the province. Flood prevention and rescue teams in areas along the river and lakes are actively preparing flood prevention equipment and drainage and irrigation tools, and are standing by. In early June, rice planthoppers and other insect pests were rampant. All parts of the province have manufactured more than 200 million jin of native pesticides and a large number of pesticide machinery, preparing to give destructive blows to destructive insect pests. The third barrier is to prevent the lodging of rice seedlings due to strong winds. At present, it has been found that some rice seedlings with excessive nitrogen fertilizer application have drooping branches and leaves and have a tendency to lodge.

　　At present, all localities focus on field management and comprehensively arrange labor. Generally, for every ten mu or so of crops, a main labor force with farming experience is assigned to be responsible, and a field management responsibility system is implemented with fixed personnel, fixed fields, and fixed work points, with targets implemented, measures in place, and responsibilities assigned to individuals.

　　Of all the principles, the leadership of the Party is the first. The Hunan Provincial Party Committee requires leaders and cadres at all levels to go deep into the work groups, backward areas, fields, and among the masses, to pool their wisdom and efforts to win a great grain harvest. At present, more than 410,000 rural cadres in the province are carrying their luggage and going deep into the fields to lead production by participating in production.

　　At the same time, the Hunan Provincial Party Committee has issued a call for "mobilizing the whole Party and the whole people, and everyone should support the thousand-jin high-yield movement," requiring all departments and units to actively and enthusiastically pave the way and give way to agriculture before autumn. (Hu Jian)

　　(Our Dispatch from Nanchang, 7th) The people of Jiangxi Province, with full vigor, have set off a vigorous early rice thousand-jin high-yield movement.

　　The 23.19 million mu of early rice sown in Jiangxi this year is generally growing well, and the early planting has already conceived ears and buds.

　　After analyzing the current favorable situation, the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee proposed to take fertilizer as the key link, grasp the five links of drought resistance, flood prevention, insect removal, weeding, and weeding, and vigorously attack the field management gate, so that first-class rice will ride the wind and waves to exceed a thousand jin, second-class rice will not give up an inch to strive for a thousand jin, and third-class rice will catch up to a thousand jin. The vast number of rural cadres and members in the province enthusiastically responded to this battle call from the Provincial Party Committee, and determined to strive to achieve a thousand jin per mu in high-yield plots, high-yield fields, and high-yield paddies, or thousand-jin ten-thousand mu, thousand-jin thousand mu, and thousand-jin commune and thousand-jin team, according to the growth of the rice seedlings. The mass thousand-jin high-yield movement has swept across every corner of the province. According to statistics from six counties in the Yichun Special Zone, including Pingxiang, Yichun, Jinxian, Fenyi, Gao'an, and Fengxin, the mu of early rice with a thousand jin high yield that have been determined accounts for 41.6% of the total area of ​​early rice in the six counties. After determining the thousand-jin high-yield fields, cadres and members immediately identified the rice seedlings one by one, classified them, formulated different cultivation and management measures, and assigned special personnel to be responsible for management.

　　After the thousand-jin high-yield movement was launched, party committees at all levels throughout the province especially strengthened their leadership over the movement. Leading cadres of the Fuzhou Prefectural Committee and the first secretaries of the county party committees led tens of thousands of cadres to meet in the fields, command the battle, and participate in the battle. When the first secretary of the Prefectural Committee commanded the battle in the Xiaoqiao People's Commune in Linchuan County, he worked with old farmers and members to formulate a set of field management methods based on the growth of the rice seedlings. As a result, the cadres and members of the whole commune became more enthusiastic, and more than 5,000 people immediately mobilized to carry out field management and accumulate and manufacture fertilizer up the mountains and down the waters. The first secretary of the Zixi County Party Committee and old farmers in the Gaobu Commune created a method of weeding rice, replanting seedlings, and pulling barnyard grass at the same time. After the members' appraisal, it was immediately promoted throughout the commune, greatly improving the quality of weeding.

　　In the early rice thousand-jin high-yield movement, all localities continued to revise and enrich the original production increase measures. The rice seedlings in the Xiangdong Commune of Pingxiang County were generally growing well, but after the launch of the thousand-jin high-yield movement, the commune party committee re-classified the rice seedlings and immediately urged the production teams to organize more than 6,000 members to accumulate fertilizer and topdress, and within two days, they added 30 dan of fertilizer per mu to about 33% of the rice seedlings. In order to manage a high-yield field of more than 3,000 mu in Che'an County's Sanwan Commune, the members changed the original "two weeding and two topdressing" plan to "three weeding and three topdressing"; the original plan was to apply 22 dan of fertilizer per mu, but now it is decided to apply 52 dan of fertilizer. After half a month of hard work by the people of the Jiujiang Special Zone, they have achieved preliminary results in the thousand-jin high-yield movement: the proportion of first-class rice in the whole district has increased from 38% in the early stage to 43%, the proportion of second-class rice has increased from 37% to 39%, and the proportion of third-class rice has decreased from 25% to 18%.

    冲破困难关　力争千斤亩
    湖南三十多县开展丰产运动，群众冒雨积肥治虫防倒伏
    江西各级干部带领群众狠抓早稻田间管理争取亩产千斤
    本报长沙7日电　湖南省开展的粮食千斤丰产运动，把当前生产推向了新高涨。在省委作出全省开展粮食千斤丰产的决定以前，攸县、长沙、醴陵、耒阳等县都已先后开展了千斤丰产竞赛运动。现在，全省已有三十六个县、市的好几百万群众热情地投入了这一运动。他们冒雨出工，积肥追肥，中耕除草，你追我赶地开展了竞赛。
    6月2日，中共湖南省委发表了给全省干部的一封公开信，指出当前开展大面积粮食千斤丰产运动的有利形势，首先是人民公社经过整顿巩固以后，在加强统一领导下，实行了分级管理，确定了经营管理制度；国家征购任务、公共积累比例已经确定；“三包一奖”的指标也已落实；广大干部思想作风有了很大的提高和改进，在组织公社生产和生活中，能更好地实行群众路线的工作方法；特别是全省粮食全面安排以后，农村人口平均每人每月能吃到四十斤粮食，这是历史上所没有的。因此，广大群众莫不欢欣鼓舞，干劲倍增。其次，广大干部和群众有了去年大跃进的丰富经验，今年的农业生产“八字宪法”又比去年执行得更早更好。加上目前早中稻生长茁壮，只要紧紧抓住田间管理，并努力战胜各种自然灾害的威胁，就能够把粮食增产的计划变成现实。
    今年湖南省千斤丰产运动特点之一，是开展因地制宜，平衡增产，提高粮食总产量。办法是：既抓大面积高额丰产，又紧紧抓住全面平衡增产；既要提高单位面积产量，又特别重视总产量的增加；既抓先进，插红旗，又要注意加强生产落后地区的领导；既大抓粮食生产，也密切注意林牧渔副业等多种经济的全面发展。总之，统筹兼顾，全面规划，因地制宜，具体安排，一切为了多打粮食，一切为了提高粮食总产量。中共湖南省委根据去年的丰产事实和今年的有利形势，要求今年全省四千六百万亩粮食耕地中，有二千万亩达到亩产千斤以上，其余二千六百万亩根据不同条件，分别达到六百、七百、八百斤。省委并要求各级干部把冲天的革命干劲与科学的分析精神结合起来，使千斤丰产运动建立在扎实牢靠的基础上。
    运动的特点之二，是在“十分指标、十二分措施、二十四分干劲”的战斗口号下，切切实实地狠抓增产措施，层层讨论，层层落实。而抓好早稻就是当前夺取丰收的主要环节。目前，距离早稻收割还有五十来天，到中稻收割还有七十来天，正是决战阶段。各地正以“后天制胜”的决心，大抓田间管理，攻破“三关”，夺取粮食大丰收。第一关是“肥料”关。实行肥料挂帅，带动全面农业生产大跃进。目前全省有三百六十多万人投入轰轰烈烈的夏季积肥运动，二十多天中已积肥二十三亿多担。第二关是防治水、旱、虫害关。6、7月，是湖南各地水、旱、虫害威胁最严重的季节。最近，全省各地已连续下雨一个多月，沿江滨湖地区防汛抢险队伍，正积极准备防汛器材和排灌工具，严阵以待。6月上旬稻飞虱等虫害盛发，全省各地已制造两亿多斤土农药和大批药械，准备给毁灭性虫害以毁灭性的打击。第三关是防止禾苗青风倒伏关。目前已发现有部分施氮肥过多的禾苗枝叶下垂，有倒伏趋势。
    目前各地都以田间管理为主，全面安排劳动力。一般每十亩田左右的农作物，即确定一个有耕作经验的主要劳动力负责，并实行定人、定田、定工分的田间管理责任制，指标落实，措施到丘，责任到人。
    千条万条，党的领导是第一条。中共湖南省委要求各级领导、各级干部层层深入下去，到作业组、到落后地区、到田间、到群众中去，群策群力，夺取粮食大丰收。目前全省已有四十一万多名农村干部背着行李，深入田间，以参加生产来领导生产。
    与此同时，中共湖南省委已发出“全党全民大动员、人人都来支援千斤丰产运动”的号召，要求各部门各单位在秋前一定要积极热情地为农业铺路、让路。　（胡坚）
    本报南昌7日电　江西省各地人民鼓足干劲，掀起了一个轰轰烈烈的早稻千斤丰产运动。
    今年江西播种的二千三百一十九万亩早稻，普遍生长良好，早插的已孕穗含苞。
    江西省委在分析了当前的有利形势以后，提出了以肥料为纲，抓住抗旱、防洪、除虫、除草和耘田等五个环节，猛攻田间管理关，使一类禾乘风破浪超千斤，二类禾一步不让争千斤，三类禾迎头跟上赶千斤的号召。全省广大农村干部和社员热烈响应省委这个战斗号召，纷纷根据禾苗生长状况，确定了争取达到亩产千斤的丰产垅、丰产片、丰产畈，或千斤万亩、千斤千亩和千斤社、千斤队。群众性的千斤丰产运动已席卷全省各个角落。仅据宜春专区萍乡、宜春、进贤、分宜、高安、奉新等六县统计，已经确定的早稻千斤丰产亩，即占六个县早稻总面积的41.6％。在确定了千斤丰产田之后，各地干部和社员立即一同逐丘鉴定禾苗，把禾苗分类排队，制定出不同的培育管理措施，并确定专人负责管理。
    千斤丰产运动开展起来后，全省各级党委特别加强了对运动的领导。抚州地委领导干部和各县县委第一书记都分别率领了上万名干部会师田间，指挥战斗，参加战斗。地委第一书记在临川县孝桥人民公社指挥战斗时，和老农、社员一道，根据禾苗生长情况，制定了一套田间管理办法。全社干部和社员因此干劲更高，五千多人立即出动进行田间管理和上山下水积肥造肥。资溪县委第一书记在高埠公社和老农一起创造了边耘禾、边补苗、边拔稗草的方法。经过社员鉴定，马上在全社推广，大大提高了耘田质量。
    在早稻千斤丰产运动中，各地不断地修改和充实原来的增产措施。萍乡县湘东公社的禾苗，原来一般生长良好，但在开展千斤丰产运动后，公社党委又将禾苗重新分类排队，立即督促各生产队组织了六千多名社员突击积肥追肥，两天内便对大约占33％的禾苗每亩追加了三十担肥料。彻安县三湾公社为了搞好一块三千多亩的千斤丰产田，社员们把原来制定的“二耘二追肥”计划，改成了“三耘三追肥”；原计划每亩追肥二十二担，现在决定追肥五十二担。九江专区经过全区人民半月苦战，已经取得了千斤丰产运动的初步成绩：全区早稻一类禾的比例已由前期的38％上升到43％，二类禾已由37％上升到39％，三类禾已由25％下降到18％。
