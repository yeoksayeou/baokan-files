Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, June 18th: "Nhan Dan" newspaper in Vietnam reported today that the Central Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front, the Vietnam Committee for the Defense of World Peace, the Vietnam Asian-African People's Solidarity Committee, and The Vietnam General Confederation of Labor issued a joint statement on June 17th, responding to the call of the World Peace Council to hold "Korea Day" on June 25th to fight for the withdrawal of US troops from South Korea and for the peaceful reunification of Korea.
  The statement said that the continued occupation of South Korea by US troops is the main obstacle to a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, a serious threat to peace in the Far East and the world, and the root cause of the suffering of the South Korean people. Therefore, the only way to peacefully reunify Korea, consolidate peace in the Far East, save the South Korean people and relieve them of their painful lives is to force the withdrawal of US troops from South Korea.
  Xinhua News Agency, Ulan Bator, June 16th: The Presidium of the Central Council of Mongolian Trade Unions decided to designate June 25th as the day for the Mongolian people to support the Korean people's struggle for the withdrawal of US armed forces from South Korea and the peaceful reunification of Korea, in response to the call of the World Federation of Trade Unions to commemorate the ninth anniversary of the Korean War by workers all over the world.

    越蒙等国准备举行“朝鲜日”
    新华社河内18日电　越南“人民报”今天报道，越南祖国战线中央委员会、越南保卫世界和平委员会、越南亚非人民团结委员会和越南总工会6月17日发表联合声明，响应世界和平理事会关于在6月25日举行“朝鲜日”为要求美军撤出南朝鲜、要求和平统一朝鲜而进行斗争的号召。
  声明说，美军继续占领南朝鲜是和平解决朝鲜问题的主要阻碍，是对远东和世界和平的严重威胁，是南朝鲜人民生活痛苦的根源。因此，要和平统一朝鲜、巩固远东和平、挽救南朝鲜人民并且解除他们痛苦生活的唯一道路，就是迫使美军撤出南朝鲜。
    新华社乌兰巴托16日电　蒙古工会中央理事会主席团决定把6月25日当做蒙古人民声援朝鲜人民争取美国武装部队撤出南朝鲜和和平统一朝鲜的斗争日，以响应世界工联关于全世界工人纪念朝鲜战争九周年的号召。
