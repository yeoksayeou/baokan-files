    A Shining Example
    ——A Meeting with Representatives of the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces
    Zhou Erfu
    On the evening of March 8, 1959, in the backstage lounge of the Caupolicán Theatre in Santiago, the capital of Chile, a heroic female soldier in a green khaki uniform walked in. She wore a short-sleeved open-necked shirt and a wide belt around her waist, with a soft military cap on her head. Behind her followed seven stalwart, spirited soldiers with full beards. They were dressed the same as her, except they wore hard military caps with large brims. Without asking, one could tell from their appearance and attire in Latin America that they were soldiers of the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces. They were a delegation from this force, visiting Chile. After watching the Chinese artists' performance, they took advantage of the intermission to meet the Chinese artists backstage.
    As soon as they entered the lounge, they were surrounded by a storm of applause. We went up to greet them and shook their hands tightly. We had never met before, but we were as warm as reunited relatives. Both sides had a lot to say, but we were so excited that we didn't know where to start, gazing at each other with smiles. At that moment, it seemed that no language was needed, and everyone knew what the other wanted to say.
    I invited them to sit down. The table was set with emerald green Longjing tea and bright red Chilean watermelon. The artists surrounded us. I first extended a heartfelt welcome to the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces delegation, led by Commander Mendoza, and congratulated the Cuban people on the victory of their revolution.
    Sitting next to me was the first woman to enter, Representative Casals. She used to be an actress in radio and television stations, and also a teacher. Once, she and her brother were arrested together. Later, she escaped from Havana to the headquarters of the Revolutionary Armed Forces and became a broadcaster for the radio station. In the free land of the Sierra Maestra mountains in Cuba, she broadcast every day: "This is the Revolutionary Radio Station, jointly organized by the 'July 26th Movement' and the Revolutionary Armed Forces..." After broadcasting the news, she left the microphone, shouldered her gun, and went to fight alongside the soldiers.
    Across from me sat several soldiers, each with their own heroic experiences. The first was Lieutenant Rafael San Martin. He grew up in Argentina and is only twenty-seven years old. He deeply admired the Cuban national hero José Martí. In October of last year, he felt compelled to join the Cuban struggle. He went to Havana, contacted the revolutionary side, and was invited to join the ranks of the revolution in the Sierra Maestra mountains. To prevent being discovered by the enemy, they specially prepared a false UNESCO passport for him, posing as an official conducting a "population survey." He arrived safely in the mountains and joined the First Column, fighting alongside Castro. He vowed never to return to Argentina until the dictator was overthrown. In just a few months, his great wish was fulfilled.
    Next to Lieutenant San Martin sat Rigardo Valladares. He worked at the radio station with Casals, but he was a commentator and a politician, a candidate for parliament from the Cuban People's Party. After Batista's coup, he became a revolutionary and participated in many dangerous tasks. Once, during a secret meeting, Batista's police arrived, and the people at the meeting tried various ways to escape. He jumped out of a second-floor window, was injured, arrested, and imprisoned. But he escaped from prison to the Sierra Maestra mountains, where he was wounded again.
    Even more heroic was Mario Hidalgo. To attack the military leader Fermin Gabre of the Holguin fortress, he shaved off his beloved beard to prevent the enemy from recognizing him, and hid in a shop in the city. When Fermin Gabre stepped out of the car and talked to the shop owner, they opened fire with five guns at the same time, ending the life of this Batista henchman. He has four children. One seventeen-year-old son sacrificed his life in the fighting in the Sierra Maestra mountains, and a sixteen-year-old son works with Castro. He proudly said: "My whole family participated in the Revolutionary Armed Forces."
    In Cuba, there are many revolutionary families like Mario Hidalgo. To overthrow the heinous, traitorous dictatorship, many families threw themselves entirely into the revolutionary torrent, some even sacrificing their most precious lives. The Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces is an army of workers and peasants, nearly 70% of whom are peasants, 10% are workers, and the rest are students, clerks, and freelancers. From the composition of this Revolutionary Armed Forces, the backbone is workers and peasants, but it includes people from all walks of life, with a very broad united front. Batista used his counter-revolutionary armed forces to rule Cuba, suppressing and massacring countless patriotic men and women. As the Cuban national hero José Martí said: "Power is not obtained by begging, it must be seized by force." To destroy the reactionary military dictatorship, the revolutionary armed forces of the people must be used. This is the best way. The Cuban people, in the bloody storm of American imperialism and Batista, stood tall and unyielding, took up guns, went to the front lines of battle, and fought against the dictator supported by the invaders. After a little more than two years, they finally achieved victory, setting a shining example in Latin America.
    You tell me, how could the Chinese artists not be thrilled to meet these outstanding representatives of the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces?
    Casals said that she loves China very much, loves the Chinese people, and hopes to have the opportunity to visit China. As soon as she finished speaking, the head of the delegation, Mendoza, spoke:
    "I have long admired the Chinese people. Today, meeting the representatives of the Chinese people and seeing such outstanding performances, I admire them even more in my heart."
    Before he could finish speaking, the bell rang backstage - the second half of the program was about to begin. Commander Mendoza finished speaking, stood up, and reluctantly said goodbye to us.
    A few days later at noon, we met again at the Xinghua Village Restaurant. They were leaving Chile in the afternoon, and specially came to attend our farewell banquet before leaving. They already had an appointment in advance, and Casals, San Martin, and Mario Hidalgo went. Commander Mendoza and several soldiers, including Orlando Penitanes, came together. Orlando Penitanes studied law at the university for two years. He joined the Revolutionary Armed Forces in November 1957, was arrested, imprisoned for a year, and suffered torture. In prison, he saw the true face of American imperialism and Batista even more clearly, increased his determination to fight, and became even stronger. Another one, carrying a camera, was called Cesar Fonseca. He is a photojournalist and also a machine gunner. He joined the fight against Batista six years ago. In a Revolutionary Armed Forces with a history of only two years, he is undoubtedly a veteran soldier. During the guerrilla war, to go down the mountain and invite teachers to teach the peasants, he cut his hair and shaved his beard twice. He is also a union organizer and an excellent propagandist. This time, he brought his camera, opened the shutter, and captured the scenes of the people of Latin American countries cheering the victory of the Cuban revolution. Of course, he now has a full beard again, with a friendly smile of revolutionary optimism always on the corners of his mouth. The youngest of them is Francisco Lago Vieira, whose face always shone with a relaxed and happy smile. His father is a farmer. After finishing the sixth grade of elementary school, he joined the revolutionary work. He once served as Castro's guard and visited Venezuela. He said: Although he did not finish his studies, the revolution needed people to work, so he participated in the revolution. Now that it is necessary to tell the people of Latin American countries the real situation and truth of Cuba, he then joined this delegation.
    This is a very meaningful thing. After the victory of the Cuban revolution, American imperialism tried every means to sabotage this revolution. One of the most vicious methods was to slander the Cuban revolutionary activities, create rumors, distort the truth, and distort the real situation in Cuba. In order to break through the American imperialist news blockade, Prime Minister Castro once held a large-scale press conference in Havana, attended by hundreds of journalists from all over the world. Then he sent this delegation to bring the real situation and revolutionary truth of Cuba to the people of Latin American countries. They have already visited six countries and will visit five more. They are envoys of the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces and also envoys of the Cuban people.
    The victory of the Cuban revolution is one of the most important events in the world in 1959, inspiring not only the people of Latin American countries, but also the people of African and Asian countries. The Chinese people express warm congratulations and firm support for the victory of the Cuban revolution. I raise my glass to congratulate the Cuban brothers on achieving even greater victories.
    Commander Mendoza stood up and said to me very excitedly:
    "It is a great pleasure to meet with the Chinese brothers. The Chinese peasants have suffered many hardships in the past, but all of this no longer exists now. However, the people of many Latin American countries are still suffering. The Cuban workers had no conditions to live a good life before the revolution of the 'July 26th Movement' brought political freedom, economic independence, and social justice to the Cuban people. The Cuban people must continue to fight to build Cuba. We abide by the promises we made to the Cuban people. Land reform is the primary task in the revolutionary program, because only land reform can lay the foundation for the development of the national economy. China has extremely valuable experience in land reform and agricultural collectivization, and hopes to have the opportunity to learn from China in the future. The Chinese people, with their rich revolutionary experience and long-standing cultural traditions, are moving forward on the broad road, building their happy lives. The great victory of the Chinese revolution has inspired the people of Latin American countries..."
    This was an unforgettable meeting, which made us deeply feel the profound friendship between the Chinese people and the Cuban people, "though separated by vast distances, we are as close as neighbors," which cannot be blocked by anything. (Attached picture)

    光辉的榜样
    ——古巴革命武装部队代表会见记
    周而复
    1959年3月8日的晚上，在智利首都圣地亚哥卡乌波利坎剧院后台休息室里，走进来一位穿绿卡叽布军服的英武的女战士，上身穿着小袖敞领衬衫，腰间束着一根宽腰带，头上戴着软军帽。她身后接着走进来七位雄赳赳气昂昂的满脸胡须的战士。和她一样装束，不同的是他们头上戴着大帽沿的硬军帽。不用问，在拉丁美洲一看到这样的仪容和装束，就知道是古巴革命武装部队的战士。他们是这一支部队的代表团，正在访问智利，看了中国艺术家的表演，乘着休息时间，到后台来会见中国的艺术家们。
    他们一进了休息室，马上就给狂风暴雨般的掌声包围住了。我们迎上去，紧紧握着他们的手。我们相互过去都不认识，但是一见面却亲热得如同久别重逢的亲人。双方都有许多话要说，可是大家激动得不知从何说起，相互微笑地注视着。这时候，仿佛不需要任何语言的媒介，大家都知道对方要讲的是什么。
    我请他们坐了下来。桌子上摆着碧绿的龙井茶和红艳艳的智利西瓜。艺术家们围绕在我们四周。我首先向门多萨团长表示衷心欢迎古巴革命武装部队代表团，并且祝贺古巴人民革命的胜利。
    坐在我旁边的是第一个走进来的妇女代表卡沙尔斯。她原来是广播电台和电视电台的演员，同时也是一位教员。一次，她和她的哥哥一道被捕了。以后，她从哈瓦那逃到革命武装部队总司令部，担任了广播电台广播员。在古巴马埃斯特腊山区自由的土地上，她每天广播：这儿是革命电台，是“7月26日运动”和革命武装部队联合组织的……”她播送完了消息，就离开播音机，背上了枪和战士们一道去战斗。
    我对面坐着几位战士，各有各的英雄经历。第一位是拉法埃尔·圣·马丁中尉。他生长在阿根廷，今年才二十七岁。他十分崇敬古巴民族英雄何塞·马蒂。去年10月，他深深感到要参加古巴战斗，到了哈瓦那，和革命方面取得联系，被邀请到马埃斯特腊山区参加革命行列。为了防止被敌人发觉，特地给他准备了一张假的联合国文教组织护照，做为一个官员去进行“人口调查”。他安全地到达了山区，参加第一纵队，和卡斯特罗一道战斗。他宣誓不把独裁者打垮，决不再回阿根廷。没有几个月的时间，他的宏愿实现了。
    圣·马丁中尉旁边坐着里加尔多·瓦亚达莱斯，他和卡沙尔斯一块在电台工作，不过，他担任的是评论员，而且是位政治家，他是古巴人民党的议员候选人。巴蒂斯塔政变以后，他成了革命者，参加许多次危险工作。有一次举行秘密会议，巴蒂斯塔的警察来了，开会的人想出各种办法逃走。他从二层楼的窗户跳出去，受了伤，被捕了，关进了监狱。但他从监狱逃到了马埃斯特腊山区，在那儿，又一次受了伤。
    比他更英勇的是马利奥·依达尔哥，为了袭击奥尔金堡垒的军事领袖费尔明·加勃莱，把他的心爱的胡须剃了，防止敌人认出他的真面目，埋伏在城里一家铺子里。当费尔明·加勃莱跳下车子，和铺子老板谈话时，他们五条枪同时开火，结束了这个巴蒂斯塔爪牙的命运。他有四个孩子，一个十七岁的孩子在马埃斯特腊山区战斗中牺牲了，一个十六岁的孩子跟随卡斯特罗工作。他很骄傲地说：我们全家都参加了革命武装部队。
    在古巴，像马利奥·依达尔哥这样的革命家庭有的是，为了推翻罪恶的出卖祖国的独裁统治，很多家庭整个投入革命的洪流，有的还献出自己最宝贵的生命。古巴革命部队是工人和农民的武装，其中近70％是农民，10％是工人，其余的是学生、职员和自由职业者。从这支革命武装部队的成份看，骨干是工人和农民，但包括了各界人士，团结面是非常广泛的。巴蒂斯塔以他的反革命的武装力量统治古巴，镇压和屠杀了无数的爱国志士。古巴民族英雄何塞·马蒂说的好：“权力不是恳求得来的，它是要武力夺取的。”摧毁反动的军事独裁统治，必须要用人民的革命的武装力量。这是最好的办法。古巴人民在美帝国主义和巴蒂斯塔血腥的风暴里，巍然不屈，拿起了枪支，走到战斗的前线，打击侵略者支持下的独裁者，经过两年多一点的时间，终于获得了胜利，在拉丁美洲树立了光辉的榜样。
    你说，中国艺术家们见到这支古巴革命武装部队的优秀代表，怎么会不欢欣鼓舞？
    卡沙尔斯说，她非常喜爱中国，喜爱中国人民，希望有机会能够访问中国。她的话刚讲完，代表团团长门多萨讲话了：
      “我很早就钦佩中国人民，今天见到中国人民的代表，又看到十分杰出的表演，心里更加钦佩。”
    他的话还没有说完，后台的铃声叮叮地响了，——下半场节目马上要开始演出了。门多萨团长讲完了话，站起来，依依不舍地和我们告别。
    几天以后的中午，我们在杏花村酒馆又见到了。他们下午就要离开智利，临行以前特地来出席我们的欢送宴会。他们事先已经有了约会，由卡沙尔斯、圣·马丁和马利奥·依达尔哥他们去了。门多萨团长和奥尔南多·培尼坦斯几位战士一块儿来了。奥尔南多·培尼坦斯在大学里学了两年法律，1957年11月参加革命武装部队，以后被捕，给关了一年监狱，受了苦刑。在监狱里，他更看清了美帝国主义和巴蒂斯塔的面目，增加了斗争的决心，锻炼得越发坚强了。另一位，身上背着照相机，他叫塞沙尔·冯塞卡。他是摄影记者，同时也是机枪手。六年以前，他就参加了反对巴蒂斯塔的斗争，在一支只有两年多历史的革命武装部队里，无疑地是一名老战士。在游击战争时期，为了下山给农民请教员来教书，他两次剪了发，剃了胡须。他也是工会的组织者，而且是出色的宣传工作者。这次，他带着照相机，打开快门，摄下拉丁美洲各国人民欢呼古巴革命胜利的镜头。当然他现在又是满脸胡须，嘴角上老是堆着革命乐观主义者的亲切的微笑。他们当中最年青的是弗朗西斯哥·拉哥·维埃拉，他脸上永远闪着轻松愉快的微笑。他父亲是个农民。他读完小学六年级，就参加革命工作。他曾经担任卡斯特罗的警卫，访问过委内瑞拉。他说：他的书虽然没有念完，但是革命需要人工作，他就参加了革命。现在需要把古巴真实情况和真理告诉拉丁美洲各国人民，他于是参加了这个代表团。
    这是一件非常有意义的事。古巴革命胜利之后，美帝国主义千方百计阴谋破坏这个革命，其中毒辣的办法之一便是污蔑古巴革命活动，造谣生事，颠倒是非，歪曲古巴的真实情况。为了冲破美帝国主义的新闻封锁，卡斯特罗总理曾经在哈瓦那举行了大规模的记者招待会，出席的全世界各国记者有好几百人之多。接着又派出这个代表团，把古巴真实情况和革命真理亲自带给拉丁美洲各国人民。他们已经访问了六个国家，还要访问五个国家。他们是古巴革命武装部队的使者，也是古巴人民的使者。
    古巴革命的胜利是1959年的世界最重大的事件之一，不仅鼓舞了拉丁美洲国家的人民，而且鼓舞了非洲和亚洲各国人民。中国人民对古巴革命的胜利表示热烈的祝贺和坚决的支持。我举起酒杯，祝贺古巴兄弟进一步获得更大的胜利。
    门多萨团长站了起来，很激动地对我说：
    “同中国兄弟们会见，令人十分高兴。中国农民在过去曾遭受过许许多多的苦难，但是这一切，现在都不存在了。可是，许多拉丁美洲国家的人民，现在仍然受着苦难。古巴的工人在‘7月26日运动’的革命给古巴人民带来了政治自由、经济独立以及社会正义以前，一直是没有条件过好日子的。古巴人民要继续进行斗争，建设古巴。我们遵守对古巴人民所做的诺言。土地改革是革命纲领中的首要任务，因为只有土地改革才能为国民经济的发展打下基础。中国在土地改革和农业集体化方面有极其宝贵的经验，希望将来有机会向中国学习。拥有丰富的革命经验和历史悠久的文化传统的中国人民正在康庄大道上向前迈进，建设他们幸福的生活。中国是世界上的一个英勇和进步的国家。中国革命的伟大胜利鼓舞了拉丁美洲各国的人民……”
    这是一次难忘的会见，它使我们深深地感觉到中国人民和古巴人民“天涯若比邻”的深厚友谊，是任何东西都阻隔不了的。（附图片）
