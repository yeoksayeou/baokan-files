　　Maintaining Traditional Characteristics
　　A characteristic of small commodities is that they are piecemeal, with a small output value, and organizing their supply is also troublesome. Therefore, some people are not very willing to produce and manage them.

　　However, small commodities occupy a significant position in people's lives. For example, buttons are indispensable for everyone; hair clips are women's "lifelong companions," and so on. Without these small commodities, people would feel extremely inconvenienced in their lives.

　　Small output value, etc., this is an economic calculation; the universal need of the people, this is a political calculation. When dealing with small commodities, one should not only calculate the small economic gains but also the big political picture. For the convenience of the people and to meet their needs has always been the principle of our socialist enterprises. Moreover, there are also things to be calculated in the economic ledger. Because small commodities are small, the raw materials used are not large, and the sources are wide. The scraps from large factories and some discarded materials can be used to make small commodities. Turning waste into wealth, turning the useless into the useful, creating wealth for the country, and seeking benefits for the people – why not do it?

　　The Shanghai Old City God Temple Bazaar has overcome the idea that some employees look down on the production and management of small commodities. Recently, the number of small commodities has increased to more than 1,300, restoring its original characteristics and being welcomed by customers. Therefore, maintaining the traditional characteristics of the market and producing some things that have always been loved by customers is by no means a trivial matter.

    保持传统特色
    小商品的特点是零星，产值小，组织货源也比较麻烦。因而有人就不大愿意去生产、经营。
    可是，小商品在人们生活中占的地位并不小。比如钮扣，人人都离不了；发卡，是妇女的“终身伴侣”等等。没有这些小商品，人们在生活中就会感到极大的不方便。
    产值小等等，这是经济账；人民普遍需要，这是政治账。对待小商品，不能光算经济小账，还要算政治大账。为了人民的方便，为了满足人民的需要，从来就是我们社会主义企业的原则。况且，就是经济账中也还有可算的地方。小商品因为是小，用的原料材料也就不大，而且来源广。大工厂的下脚料，一些废弃的物资，都可以用来做成小商品。废物再生，无用变有用，为国家创造财富，为人民谋福利，何乐而不为。
    上海老城隍庙商场克服了部分职工瞧不起生产和经营小商品的思想，最近小商品增加到一千三百多种，恢复了原有的特色，受到顾客的欢迎。所以保持市场传统特色生产一些历来为顾客爱好的东西，绝不是一件小事。
