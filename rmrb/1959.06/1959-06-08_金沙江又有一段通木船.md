    Another Section of the Jinsha River is Open to Wooden Boats
    In the Jinsha River within Yunnan Province, known for its high waves and rapid currents, another section has been added to the navigable distance for wooden boats. Recently, seven wooden boats fully loaded with supplies traveled downstream from Duomei Street in Heqing County, Yunnan, and in less than half a day, traveled forty-five kilometers, reaching the highway ferry in Yongsheng County.
    From now on, cotton, brown sugar, and other products abundant in the Duomei area of the Jinsha River valley in Heqing County can be smoothly transported out.

    金沙江又有一段通木船
    在云南境内浪高流急的金沙江里，又增加了一段木船通航里程。最近，有七支满载物资的木船，从云南鹤庆县朵美街顺流而下，不到半天，航行了四十五公里，到达永胜县的公路渡口。
    从此鹤庆县金沙江河谷地带朵美地区，盛产的棉花、红糖等就可顺利外运了。
