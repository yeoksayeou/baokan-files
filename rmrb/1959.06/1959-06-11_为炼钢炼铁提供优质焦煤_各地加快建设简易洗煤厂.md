Xinhua News Agency, 10th: Across the country, 195 simple coal washing plants are being built at an accelerated pace. These plants have been starting construction successively since March of this year. Based on the total designed capacity, they can wash and process 64.3 million tons of raw coal annually.

As of the end of May, the civil engineering construction, such as factory buildings, of 55 simple coal washing plants had been completed; the civil engineering of another 87 plants had been basically completed and were in the final stages; the projects with the fastest progress have already started installing mechanical equipment, and some have already been put into production. Many plants are adopting the method of installing equipment as it arrives, piece by piece, in order to shorten the installation time and strive to put them into production as soon as possible.

The two simple coal washing plants built by the Fengfeng Coal Mine in Hebei were put into production in mid-May. Another batch of simple coal washing plants will be put into production in June. The two plants that have already been put into production can process 300,000 tons of raw coal annually and 600,000 tons of raw coal annually, respectively. The quality and recovery rate of the washed coal produced by these two plants have exceeded the design standards. In May, the Ministry of Coal Industry held an on-site meeting in Fengfeng, observed the production of the simple coal washing plants, and exchanged construction experiences. Participants in the meeting believed that the design of the simple coal washing plants was successful. It requires less investment, is quick to build, and is a good way to develop the coal washing industry in a faster, better, and more economical way under the current conditions in our country.

Various regions have taken many effective measures to accelerate the construction of these simple coal washing plants. The Zibo Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China in Shandong and the Party Committee of the Zibo Mining Bureau established a command headquarters for simple coal washing plants to specifically lead the construction of simple coal washing plants. They concentrated manpower and material resources, enabling three simple coal washing plants to quickly complete civil engineering construction such as factory buildings, and two plants are accelerating the installation of mechanical equipment. Some simple coal washing plants in Shandong, Jiangsu, Shanxi, Heilongjiang, and Ningxia and other places have also achieved relatively fast construction speeds due to the adoption of methods such as concentrating efforts, carrying out concentrated attacks in batches, and fast construction. For example, a simple coal washing plant with an annual processing capacity of 300,000 tons of raw coal, built in Zhuzibu, Zaozhuang, Shandong Province, took only nine days to build the factory building. The construction of factory buildings for two simple coal washing plants with an annual output of 600,000 tons in Chengzihe, Jixi, Heilongjiang Province, also took only fifteen days. After inspection by inspectors sent there by the State Economic Commission, the project quality was deemed qualified. (Attached picture)

    为炼钢炼铁提供优质焦煤
    各地加快建设简易洗煤厂
    新华社10日讯　全国有一百九十五个简易洗煤厂正在加速建设。这些厂是今年3月以来陆续开工的，按照总的设计能力计算，它们每年可以洗选六千四百三十万吨原煤。
    到5月底为止，有五十五个简易洗煤厂的厂房等土建工程已经完成；另有八十七个厂的土建工程基本完成，正在收尾；工程进展最快的，已开始安装机械设备，个别的已经投入生产。很多厂都采取设备到一件安装一件的办法，以缩短安装时间，争取早日投入生产。
    河北峰峰煤矿建设的两座简易洗煤厂，5月中旬已经投入生产。6月份还将有一批简易洗煤厂投入生产。已经投入生产的两个厂，一个每年能处理原煤三十万吨，一个每年能处理原煤六十万吨。这两个厂生产的洗煤，质量和回收率都超过了设计标准。煤炭工业部5月间在峰峰召开了现场会议，观摩了简易洗煤厂的生产和交流了建设的经验。参加会议的人认为，简易洗煤厂的设计是成功的。它投资少，建设快，在我国目前的情况下，是多快好省地发展洗煤工业的一个好办法。
    各地都采取很多有效措施，加速建设这些简易洗煤厂。中共山东淄博市委和淄博矿务局党委成立了简易洗煤厂指挥部，专门领导简易洗煤厂的建设。他们集中人力物力，使三个简易洗煤厂很快就完成了厂房等土建工程，有两个厂正在加速安装机械设备。山东、江苏、山西、黑龙江和宁夏等地的一些简易洗煤厂，也由于采取了集中力量，分批突击，快速施工等方法，建厂速度都相当地快。如建设在山东省枣庄朱子埠的一个年处理三十万吨原煤的简易洗煤厂，厂房只用九天时间就建设起来了。黑龙江省鸡西城子河两个年产六十万吨的简易洗煤厂，厂房建设也只用了十五天的时间，经过国家经济委员会派往那里的检查员检查，认为工程质量合格。（附图片）
