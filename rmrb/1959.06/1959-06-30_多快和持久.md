How Fast and How Durable

On the track of the leap forward in steel production, the steelmaking warriors of Anshan Iron and Steel's No. 6 open-hearth furnace can truly be called excellent athletes who can both load more and smelt quickly, and fight a protracted war.

“Load more, smelt quickly, and maintain the furnace body” is the comprehensive operating principle for open-hearth steelmaking. Loading more means expanding the charge volume of the open-hearth furnace; smelting quickly means shortening the steelmaking time; maintaining the furnace body means being able to fight a protracted war. The utilization coefficient of a furnace is never reflected in a single day's record, but in continuous records. If, in the beginning, a lot of materials are charged and steel is made very quickly, but the maintenance of the furnace body is neglected, then in the end, the furnace body will be damaged and production will be stopped for repairs, which still fails to meet the requirements of loading more and smelting quickly. This is like an inexperienced athlete who sprints desperately as soon as he gets on the track, and the speed is very fast. Just as people are applauding him, he gradually falls behind others because his "physical strength" cannot support him.

In actual work, some impatient people blindly pursue high output in a short period of time, only seeing the huge effects of loading more and smelting quickly, but not seeing the hidden dangers of relaxing furnace body maintenance. This point deserves serious attention.

    多快和持久
    在钢铁生产跃进的跑道上，鞍钢六号平炉的炼钢战士真可以称得起既能多装快炼、又能打持久战的优秀运动员。
    “多装、快炼和维护炉体”，这是平炉炼钢的全面操作方针。多装，就是扩大平炉装入量；快炼，就是要缩短炼钢时间；维护炉体，就是要求能打持久战。一座炉子利用系数的大小，绝不表现在某一天的纪录上，而是表现在连续的纪录上。如果开始的时候，装料很多，炼起钢来也很快，而对炉体维护工作放任不管，到最后，炉体损伤停工检修，仍然不能达到多装快炼的要求。这好比一个缺乏经验的运动员，一上跑道，拚命奔驰，速度很快，正当人们为他鼓掌的时候，他却因为“体力”支持不住，又逐渐地落在别人的后面。
    在实际工作里，有些性子急躁的人，一味追求短期间的高产，只看到多装快炼的巨大效果，却没看到放松炉体维护的后患。这一点，值得严重注意。
