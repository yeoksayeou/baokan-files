    Watching the Handball Competition

    On the handball field of the Hefei competition zone of the First National Games handball preliminary round, exciting and astonishing scenes occurred one after another. The audience in Hefei watched the competition of this new sport with great interest.

    In the fierce battle between the Beijing women's handball team and the Hebei women's handball team, Ma Renfang, the Beijing team's forward, received the ball and rushed towards the goal area. An opposing player jumped up to block the ball. Ma Renfang's body tilted to the side, and the audience thought she was about to fall; but taking advantage of the opponent's jump and before they landed, she suddenly shot the ball into the goal from a very low angle. This is a more advanced "diving shot."

    Handball has only been developed in our country for two years. This sport requires a large field and involves passing and shooting, requiring athletes to have comprehensive training in agility, speed, stamina, throwing power, and jumping ability. Because it resembles basketball and football, it has quickly attracted many enthusiasts.

    After watching the game at the stadium, the reporter interviewed Zhou You, the chief referee of the Hefei competition zone. He said that in the past two years, China's handball movement has made great progress, and the athletes' individual skills and collective tactics have improved significantly. Last year, female athletes found it difficult to shoot from 13 meters away from the goal, but now they can shoot powerfully from 19 or even 20 meters away. The shooting posture is no longer limited to individual breakthroughs, continuous cuts, and jump shots, but also includes more advanced actions such as long shots, surprise shots, turning shots, and hitting shots. Defensively, it's no longer just a one-line defense; athletes dare to come out and actively defend outside the "free-throw line." Some teams have also adopted varied tactics such as jumping feints and reverse cross-cuts.

    The reporter also interviewed coaches and athletes from some teams, all of whom had undergone very arduous training. Many athletes practiced throwing more than 300 times a day, and also practiced shooting, passing, and tactics. Goalkeepers had to dive more than 150 times a day. The Beijing women's handball team persisted in practicing even when the weather was freezing in Beijing. In each game, they carefully studied the characteristics of their opponents and summarized their experiences of success and failure. Laja, a farmer-born athlete from the Tibet men's handball team, had only been formally practicing handball for less than four months. Due to his diligence and hard work, his breakthrough ability and jumping side-shooting skills were praised by the audience during the competition. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    看手球竞赛
    第一届全国运动会手球分区预赛合肥竞赛区的球场上，精彩惊人的镜头，一个接一个。合肥的观众兴趣浓厚地观看了这种新运动项目的比赛。
    北京女子手球队对河北女子手球队的激战中，北京队前锋马纫芳接了球冲往球门区。对方的一个队员急跃阻球。马纫芳的身体往边上一倾，观众看她快要倒地了；但她趁对方跳起还未落地，突然在很低的角度射进了一球。这就是比较高级的“倒地射门”。
    手球这种运动在我国开展还只两年。这种运动所要的场地大，有传球、射门，要求运动员有灵敏、速度、体力、投掷力、弹跳等方面的全面锻炼。由于它类似篮球又像足球，所以很快就吸引了很多爱好者。
    记者在球场看完比赛后，访问了合肥竞赛区总裁判周游。他说，两年来我国手球运动有很大进步，运动员个人技术、集体战术都有了显著提高。去年，女运动员们离球门十三公尺射门还显得吃力，而现在却能在十九甚至二十公尺以外的地方很有劲地射门。射门的姿势也不是个人突破、连续切进、跃起射门了，还有远射、冷射、转体射门和打式射门等比较高级的动作。防守也不仅是一线防守，运动员敢于出来到“任意线”外面积极防守了。有些球队还采用了跃起佯攻、反交叉切入等变化多端的战术。
    记者还访问了一些球队的教练员和运动员，他们都经过非常艰苦的锻炼，很多运动员一天要练习投掷三百多次，还要练射门、传球和战术等。守门员一天也要扑?一百五十多次。北京女子手球队在北京有时遇到冰天雪地的情况，也坚持练习。她们在每次比赛时都认真研究对方的特点，总结成败经验。西藏男子手球队农民出身的运动员拉甲，正式练手球还不到四个月，由于平时勤学苦练，在比赛中突破能力和跃起侧射的技巧，都受到观众们的赞赏。　（据新华社）
