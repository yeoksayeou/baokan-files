    Seriously Read More Books
    Shi Dongxiang
    The publication and distribution of books in our country has greatly developed in recent years. The variety and quantity of books published has far exceeded the era of old China, and more and more people love to read. Reading is no longer a privilege enjoyed only by a small number of people, as it was in the old society. The broad masses of working people, after learning basic literacy, have begun to appreciate the benefits of reading. Many people engaged in practical work also increasingly feel the necessity of reading more books. Those who work in cultural and academic fields, needless to say, need to read more books seriously.
    The reason we read is because books can spread advanced ideas and knowledge of science and technology in all fields; through reading, we can broaden our horizons, expand our knowledge domain, and improve our thinking ability.
    The source of thought and knowledge is practice. In human history, generations of people, through the practice of production struggle and social life (class struggle), have continuously advanced scientific knowledge. Later generations can accept the knowledge already acquired by their predecessors and, on this basis, rely on new practice to seek new knowledge, so later generations can be more intelligent than their predecessors and have more advanced and richer scientific knowledge than their predecessors. It is wrong to only accept the knowledge of predecessors without continuing to develop it in practice; but it is equally wrong not to accept the knowledge and scientific achievements already attained by predecessors, as this would also cause the development of human knowledge to stagnate. To accept the knowledge and scientific achievements already attained by predecessors, and to ensure that a person's knowledge is not limited to the small scope of personal experience, one should read more books.
    Throughout history, every accomplished scientist and theorist has been a tireless and assiduous scholar. Marx was the greatest scientist in human history, the most talented person, but he was also the most diligent reader. He not only studied philosophy, economics, history, and law, but also extensively read books on linguistics, mathematics, and other natural sciences, and achieved high attainments in many fields. Once, when he was ill and unable to engage in research, he read many books on biology. Of course, Marx was not a person who rigidly adhered to book knowledge. As Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Marx not only participated in the actual movement of revolution, but also carried out the theoretical creation of revolution." The creation of Marxism was a great earth-shaking revolution in the history of human thought. Marx's ability to become the creator of proletarian revolutionary theory is inseparable from the profound knowledge he gained from assiduous reading. Those who aspire to be Marx's elementary school students should, in terms of learning, adhere to the principle of combining theory with practice and strive to cultivate a spirit of assiduous reading.
    Some of our comrades do not truly understand the significance of reading seriously. Some seem to think that reading seriously means blindly believing in books, will lead to detachment from reality, and that reading too much will turn one into a dogmatist. This erroneous idea is very harmful to academic workers, educators, practical workers, and even young students.
    Admittedly, some people, after reading some books, have become bookworms and committed the error of dogmatism. However, the reason they make mistakes is not because they read too much, but because their reading methods are wrong, and their attitude towards book knowledge is wrong. They regard book knowledge as a panacea, attempting to use it to "cope with all changes by remaining unchanged," thus detaching themselves from reality. With this attitude towards reading, even the best books and the most beneficial book knowledge will become harmful in their hands. However, if we use the opposite attitude and method to read, if we read by combining theory with practice, and if we treat book knowledge with an analytical attitude, then, it should be said that the more books one reads, the smarter one will become, and one will never become more and more dull. Gorky once made this vivid description: "Almost every book seems to open up a window to a new, unknown world for me." "The more books I read, the more books bring me closer to the world." Anyone who is good at reading will have this experience. Dogmatism is not the inevitable result of reading, let alone the inevitable result of reading a lot. In fact, some dogmatists here are not people who read a lot, but people who read very little. Narrow knowledge is often a common ailment of some people who commit the error of dogmatism. This narrowness of knowledge also contributes to their one-sidedness and subjectivity of thought. Of course, there are also dogmatists who have read a lot of books and have relatively rich book knowledge.
    Our party has always resolutely opposed dogmatism, but our party has never and will never fail to attach importance to book knowledge because of this. Comrade Mao Zedong and the Party Central Committee have always, on the one hand, pointed out the error of treating book knowledge with a dogmatic attitude, and on the other hand, consistently emphasized the need to learn book knowledge with the correct method. Not only academic workers, but also all practical workers, should seriously read more books to improve their knowledge level and work ability, so that they are good at analyzing and summarizing experience, in order to raise practical experience to theory and reduce blindness in action.
    “Blind faith in books” and “no books” are two different kinds of one-sidedness. But people who make these two kinds of one-sided mistakes have one thing in common: they do not really understand the nature and function of book knowledge. People who "blindly believe in books" seem to hold book knowledge very high, but in fact they do not understand that book knowledge ultimately comes from direct experience, they do not understand that it needs to be constantly supplemented and developed, and especially they do not understand that book knowledge is a tool for solving new tasks, so they become slaves to books. People who "do not want books" regard book knowledge as the source of dogmatism, and in order to avoid falling into it, they give up eating for fear of choking, and adopt an attitude of respecting ghosts and gods and keeping them at a distance towards book knowledge. In fact, if someone wants to use the method of "no books" to oppose "blind faith in books," and use the method of not reading or reading less to oppose dogmatism, that cannot defeat dogmatism. As long as the purpose of reading is to solve practical problems, the method of reading is the method of combining theory with practice, and the reader actively cares about various problems in real life, then we can become the masters of books, not the slaves of books.
    Reading requires time, and it requires sitting down. Some people say that although I want to read, practical work is urgent, and there is no time. Many comrades engaged in practical work do have this trouble. But if we truly recognize the importance of reading and can rationally arrange work and life, we can always find some time to read. In the old society, many advanced people often suffered from the lack of conditions for reading, and even could not get the books they wanted to read. But they still tried every means to overcome difficulties and read many books very seriously. Our reading conditions today are, in any case, much better than theirs, and we should cherish our time. This point should probably be raised even more for many young comrades. People read more good books in their youth, as long as the direction is correct, it can have long-term benefits.
    Reading has never been valued as much as it is now, and book knowledge has never been able to exert its power as it does now. Only in the great era we are in can book knowledge be truly seized from the hands of a few and become a sharp weapon for hundreds of millions of people to seek truth and seek methods to transform the objective world. The current socialist construction and the future communist construction both require people to have a high degree of cultural and scientific knowledge. Precisely because of this, communists are the most active advocates and practitioners of reading in history. This is fundamentally incomparable to any "wise" monarch or any scholar of the ruling class in history. Lenin said in his famous report "The Tasks of the Youth Leagues": "Only by enriching our minds with all the knowledge treasure created by mankind can we become communists." We should strive to become such communists.

    认真地多读些书
    施东向
    我国书籍的出版和发行工作，在这几年来有了很大的发展。书籍出版的品种、数量之多，已经远远超过了旧中国时代，爱读书的人越来越多。读书，已经不像在旧社会那样，只是一小部分人享有的特权。广大劳动人民在学习了初步的文化之后，开始体会到了读书的益处。许多做实际工作的人，也越来越感到有多读些书的必要。在文化学术方面做工作的人，不用说，更加需要认真地多读些书。
    我们之所以要读书，是因为书籍能够传播先进思想，能够传播科学技术各方面的知识；通过读书，可以使我们扩大眼界，扩大知识领域，并且提高思想能力。
    思想和知识的来源是实践。在人类历史上，一代代的人通过生产斗争和社会生活（阶级斗争）的实践，不断地使科学知识向前发展。后来的人因为可以接受前人已经取得的知识，并且在这个基础上依靠新的实践而求得新的知识，所以后来的人就能够比前人更加聪敏，具有比前人更进步更丰富的科学知识。如果只是接受前人的知识而不能在实践中继续加以发展，是不对的；但是如果不去接受前人已经取得的知识和已经达到的科学成就，那么人类知识的发展也同样会停滞下来，当然也是不对的。要接受前人已经取得的知识和已经达到的科学成就，要使一个人的知识不仅限于个人经验所及的小范围内，就应当多读些书。
    历史上一切有成就的科学家、理论家，没有一个不是孜孜不倦的苦学者。马克思是人类史上最伟大的科学家，是最有天才的人，但他也是最勤奋的读书的人。他不仅攻读哲学、经济学、历史学、法学这些方面的书，而且在语言学、数学以及其他自然科学方面，也是博览群书，并且在很多方面达到了很高的造诣。有一次当他生病不能从事研究工作的时候，还阅读了好些生物学的书。当然，马克思并不是死守着书本知识的人。如同毛泽东同志所说：“马克思不但参加了革命的实际运动，而且进行了革命的理论创造。”马克思主义的创立是人类思想史上的一个翻天复地的伟大革命。马克思能够成为无产阶级革命理论的创造者，是与他从刻苦读书中获得的渊博的学识分不开的。有志于做马克思的一个小学生的人，应当在学习方面，坚持理论和实际相结合的原则，努力养成刻苦读书的精神。
    我们有些同志，并不真正了解认真读书的意义。有人似乎以为，认真读书就是迷信书本，就会脱离实际，读书多了就会变成教条主义。这种错误想法，无论对于学术工作者、教育工作者，或者对于实际工作者，以至对于青年学生，都是非常有害的。
    固然有些人，在读了一些书以后，变成了书呆子，犯教条主义的错误。可是他们的犯错误，原因并不在于他们读书太多，而在于他们的读书方法是错误的，他们对待书本知识的态度是错误的。他们把书本知识看成万应灵药，企图用它来“以不变应万变”，脱离了实际。用这种态度去读书，多么好的书，多么有益的书本知识，在他们手里，也会成为有害的东西。但是，如果用相反的态度和方法去读书，用理论联系实际的方法去读书，用一种分析的态度去对待书本知识，那么，应当说，书越读得多，人会变得越聪明，而绝不会越读越呆的。高尔基曾经做过这样生动的描写：“几乎每一本书都似乎在我面前打开了新的、不知道的世界的窗口”。“书越读得多，书籍就越使我和世界接近。”凡是善于读书的人都会有这种体验。教条主义不是读书的必然结果，更不是读书多的必然结果。事实上，我们这里有些教条主义者，并不是读书很多，而是读书很少的人。知识偏狭，往往是某些犯教条主义错误的人的通病。这种知识上的偏狭，也助长了他们思想的片面性、主观性。当然，读了很多的书，书本知识比较丰富的教条主义者也是有的。
    我们党一向是坚决反对教条主义的，但是，我们党却从没有也永远不会因此而不重视书本知识。毛泽东同志和党中央向来是一方面指出用教条主义的态度对待书本知识的错误，一方面又一贯强调要用正确的方法学习书本知识。不仅学术工作者，而且一切实际工作者，都应该认真地多读一些书，以提高自己的知识水平和工作能力，使自己善于分析和总结经验，以便把实际经验提高到理论，减少行动中的盲目性。
      “迷信书本”和“不要书本”，是两种不同的片面性。但犯这两种片面性毛病的人有个共同之处，他们都不真正了解书本知识的性质和作用。“迷信书本”的人，似乎把书本知识捧得很高，但实际上他们不懂得书本知识归根结底来自直接经验，不懂得它是要不断补充和发展的，尤其不懂得书本知识是服务于解决新的任务的工具，因此他们做了书本的奴隶。“不要书本”的人，则把书本知识看成是教条主义的渊薮，为了避免陷到那里面去，却因噎废食，对书本知识采取敬鬼神而远之的态度。事实上，如果有人想用“不要书本”的办法来反对“迷信书本，用不读书或少读书的办法来反对教条主义，那是不能战胜教条主义的。只要读书的目的是为了解决实际问题，读书的方法是理论联系实际的方法，读书的人又积极地关心现实生活中的各种问题，那么，我们就能够成为书本的主人，而不是书本的奴隶。
    读书，需要有时间，需要坐下来。有人说，我虽然想读书，但实际工作紧迫，没有时间，许多做实际工作的同志，的确有这种苦恼。但是如果真正认识了读书的重要性，能够合理地安排工作和生活，总还是可以找到一点时间来读书的。在旧社会里，许多先进的人们，往往苦于没有读书的条件，甚至得不到要读的书。但他们还是千方百计，克服困难，非常认真地读了很多书。我们今天的读书条件，无论如何，比他们好得多，我们应当珍惜我们的时间。这一点，对于许多青年同志恐怕是更应当提出的。人们在青年时代多读一些好书，只要方向正确，就能够有长远的好处。
    读书这件事，历史上从来没有像我们现在这样被重视过，书本知识从来也不可能像我们现在这样发挥它的力量。只有在我们所处的这样的伟大时代里，书本知识才真正从少数人的手里夺过来，变成亿万人民寻求真理，寻求改造客观世界的方法的锐利武器。当前的社会主义建设，未来的共产主义建设，都要求人们有高度的文化科学知识。正因为这样，共产主义者是历史上最积极的读书的倡导者和亲身实践者。这是历史上任何“贤明的”君王和任何统治阶级的文人学者所根本无法比拟的。列宁在“青年团底任务”那篇著名报告里说过：“只有用人类创造的全部知识财富来丰富自己的头脑时，才能成为共产主义者。”我们应当努力成为这样的共产主义者。
