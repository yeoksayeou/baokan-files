    People who come to Huai'an City for the first time are always very interested in the large quantities of fresh and diverse vegetables produced in this town.

    Here, whether it is morning or dusk, all kinds of fresh vegetables can be bought everywhere; the quantity is abundant, and the varieties are complete. It not only guarantees the needs of the local market (the whole city can eat more than two kilograms of vegetables per person per day), but also supports large and medium-sized cities in ten brother provinces and cities.

    How did this town develop vegetable production?

    Establishing Vegetable Bases

    Huai'an City is an ancient city in Jiangsu Province. Local farmers have rich experience in cultivating vegetables, and vegetables have always been self-sufficient. However, since the Great Leap Forward, new factories and enterprises have continued to increase, the number of employees has grown rapidly, and the purchasing power of the people has greatly increased, and the demand for non-staple foods, especially vegetables, has increased accordingly. Therefore, relying solely on the original small number of "part-time" teams to produce vegetables is far from enough to meet the needs of the growing urban population.

    The Huai'an Town Committee, in accordance with the spirit of "agriculture in the suburbs, vegetables first," re-planned vegetable production and adjusted crop layout. In the ten production brigades, the Xincheng, Jiacheng, and Lianhe brigades around the urban area were designated as specialized brigades to establish vegetable bases. The town party secretary took the lead, and four cadres, including the director of the supply and marketing department, the organization committee member, and the director of the women's federation, were assigned to serve as branch secretaries or captains of the brigades, strengthening specific leadership over vegetable production.

    In mobilizing commune members to plan vegetable production and implementing production targets, the town party committee promoted the policy of serving the city in the suburbs to the masses through a series of meetings, and explained that rations were uniformly dispatched by the state and sales were the responsibility of the commercial departments. This eliminated the masses' concerns about growing vegetables. The Lianhe Brigade originally planned to plant only 40% of the land with vegetables, but now all of it is planted with vegetables.

    Urban Residents Also Grow Vegetables

    On the premise of professional production as the main focus, the Huai'an Town Committee also called on urban residents to grow vegetables in their spare time. This call received enthusiastic response from the masses, and quickly formed a production upsurge of "greenery inside and outside the city, vegetable gardens dug beside houses." The Shaohu Residents Committee not only mobilized residents to grow fifteen mu of vegetables by household, but also newly reclaimed forty mu of land and established a vegetable garden collectively produced by residents. Since the beginning of this year, it has harvested more than 200,000 jin of various vegetables, basically achieving self-sufficiency in vegetables.

    Mobilizing urban residents to grow vegetables can not only reduce the burden on market supply, but also improve residents' lives and increase residents' income. Zhong Ruiwen of the Shaohu Residents Committee planted one and a half mu of vegetables beside his house. In addition to providing for his family, he also had surplus vegetables to sell every month. He sold more than 400 jin of amaranth alone recently.

    "Evergreen"

    The vast number of consumers can not only eat abundant vegetables in spring and summer, but also fresh vegetables in winter. This is a feature of the "evergreen" vegetable production in Huai'an City.

    The story starts from last winter. At that time, they conducted bold experiments on "planting summer vegetables in winter." At first, a few people did not approve of this approach. They said, "Growing hot peppers and tomatoes in the dead of winter? I've never seen it, I've never even heard of it!" But after discussion, everyone believed that if flowers can bloom in winter in greenhouses, vegetables can grow in winter in vegetable gardens. So, on the one hand, technical research groups were established in each production team to investigate the soil, analyze the growth environment of various vegetables, and summarize past experience in cultivating vegetables; on the other hand, based on the scientific principle of warm bed seedling cultivation, experiments on "planting summer vegetables in winter" began.

    The "summer vegetable planting in winter" experiment received strong support from the commercial sector. For example, for warm bed seedling cultivation, glass was needed, and the commercial sector supplied them with more than 30 boxes at one time, and also helped them purchase more than one million jin of reed stalks from other places, which promptly solved the need for staking vegetable fields. Vegetable stores also organized more than 80 employees to deliver fertilizer to the countryside. The commune members were also full of enthusiasm for planting vegetables, and they put forward the fighting slogan of "vegetable garden management surpassing flower garden." "Summer vegetable planting in winter" was finally successful. On the streets of Huai'an City in winter, various summer vegetables such as tomatoes, cucumbers, hot peppers, kidney beans, cabbage, and small white radishes appeared.

    The successful fact of "summer vegetable planting in winter" further strengthened their determination to change the "seasonal restrictions on vegetable production" and to use great efforts to solve the problem of "supply shortage in midsummer," which has been difficult to overcome over the years. They held a forum for veteran farmers in the spring to summarize the experience of planting soup vegetables. According to the results of investigation and research, all the city's more than 100 mu of "night tide sandy soil" (this kind of soil is suitable for planting soup vegetables in summer) were planted with small soup vegetables, which have now begun to be put on the market. According to the general yield calculation, each mu can produce 2,000 jin; three rotations in two months can produce more than 600,000 jin. This can not only guarantee the needs of the local summer market, but also support a part of other places, fundamentally solving the problem of "supply shortage in midsummer."

    Here, the vegetable fields are evergreen all year round, and the supply of vegetables in the market is continuous.

    Thousands of Miles of Vegetables Delivered

    The great development of vegetable production in Huai'an City has strongly supported the vegetable needs of brother cities and industrial and mining areas.

    There are many things to say in this regard. For example, in January, a guest from the front line in Fujian wanted to buy a portion of pickles. After hearing this news, the Non-staple Food Management Department held a meeting of processing personnel that night and rushed to produce more than 3,000 jin of high-quality red slices, which met the needs of foreign tourists. According to the statistics of this management department, from January to the end of May, 10.07 million jin of fifteen kinds of pickles such as red slices and kohlrabi were transferred to Shanghai, Dalian and other places through processing. More than 1.2 million jin of various fresh vegetables were transferred to the Xuzhou industrial and mining area. It is still being transferred out in a steady stream. Local vegetable farmers and vegetable market personnel pick out good quality vegetables for transfer to support the working class.

    The Huai'an Shuyang Engineering Team of the HuaiShu New River wrote on a red flag presented to thank Huai'an City for its support of vegetables: "Thousands of miles of green vegetables delivered, deep friendship through cooperation!"

    However, the people here are not satisfied with the achievements they have made. They said that they will continue to exert their energy and produce more and better vegetables to support large cities and industrial and mining areas.

    “四季常青”的淮安城
    中共淮阴地委财贸工作组
    初到淮安城的人们，总会对这个城镇出产大量的、新鲜的、品种多样的蔬菜发生很大的兴趣。
    在这里，不论是早晨，还是黄昏，到处可以买到各种新鲜的蔬菜；数量充沛，品种齐全。不仅保证了当地市场需要（全城每人每天可以吃到两斤以上的蔬菜），并且支援了十个兄弟省市的大中城市。
    这个城镇是怎样发展蔬菜生产的呢？
    建立蔬菜基地
    淮安城，是江苏省一座古老的城市。当地农民有着培植蔬菜的丰富经验，蔬菜一向可以自给。但大跃进以来，新的工厂企业不断增加，就业人员迅速增长，人民群众的购买力大大提高了，对副食品的需要，特别是蔬菜的需要量相应增大了。因此，仅靠原来少数的“兼业”队伍来生产蔬菜，已经远不能适应城市人口增长的需要了。
    淮安城镇委根据“郊区农业、蔬菜第一”的精神，重新规划了蔬菜生产，调整了作物布局。在十个生产大队中，将城区周围的新城、夹城、联合三个大队，划为专业大队，建立蔬菜基地。由镇委书记挂帅，并抽出供销部主任、组织委员和妇联主任等四个干部，担任大队支部书记或队长，加强对蔬菜生产的具体领导。
    在发动社员规划蔬菜生产，使生产指标落实的过程中，镇委通过一系列的会议，向群众宣传了郊区为城市服务的方针，并说明口粮由国家统一调度，销路由商业部门负责。这样，就消除了群众对种植蔬菜的顾虑。联合大队原计划只将40％的土地种蔬菜，现在全部种了蔬菜。
    城镇居民也种菜
    在专业生产为主的前提下，淮安镇委又号召城镇居民，利用业余时间种植蔬菜。这个号召受到群众的热烈响应，很快形成了“城里城外一片青，家旁屋后刨菜园”的生产高潮。勺湖居民委员会不仅发动居民分户种植了十五亩蔬菜，而且新开垦了四十亩土地，建立起一个由居民集体生产的菜园。今年以来已收获各种蔬菜二十多万斤，基本上做到了蔬菜自给。
    发动城市居民种植蔬菜，不但可以减少市场供应的负担，同时也改善了居民生活，增加了居民收入。勺湖居民委员会锺瑞文，在屋旁种了一分半地的蔬菜，除供一家人自吃以外，每月还有多余蔬菜出售，单苋菜一项，最近就卖出四百多斤。
    “四季常青”
    广大消费者不仅春夏两季能吃到丰富的蔬菜，而且在冬季也能吃到新鲜的蔬菜。这是淮安城蔬菜生产“四季常青”的一个特色。
    话要从去年冬天说起。那时，他们对“夏菜冬植”进行了大胆的试验。开始，有少数人不赞成这种做法。他们说：“十冬腊月长大椒、结番茄，不但没有看过，连听都没有听过！”但经过讨论，大家认为：花房冬季既能开花，菜园冬季就能长菜。于是，一方面在各生产队成立技术研究小组，调查土壤，分析各种蔬菜的生长环境，总结已往培育蔬菜的经验；另一方面根据温床育苗的科学原理，开始了“夏菜冬植”的试验。
    “夏菜冬植”的试验，受到商业部门大力的支持。比如：搞温床育苗，需要玻璃，商业部门一次就供应他们三十多箱，同时还帮助他们到外地采购一百余万斤芦柴，及时解决了菜田打芭的需要。蔬菜商店还组织八十多个职工送肥下乡。社员种植蔬菜的干劲也十足，他们提出“菜园管理超花园”的战斗口号。“夏菜冬植”终于成功了。在淮安城冬天的街头，曾经出现了番茄、黄瓜、大椒、梅豆、披头、雀头小萝卜等各种夏菜。
    “夏菜冬植”成功的事实，更加坚定了他们改变“蔬菜生产受季节限制”的决心，用大力来解决历年来很难克服的蔬菜“伏缺”问题。他们在春季就召开了老农座谈会，总结种植汤菜的经验。根据调查研究的结果，将全城一百余亩“夜潮砂土”（这种土质适宜夏季种植汤菜）全部种上小汤菜，目前已开始上市。从一般产量计算，每亩可产两千斤；两月轮作三次，可产六十多万斤。这不但可以保证本地夏季市场需要，同时还可支援外地一部分，从根本上解决了“伏缺”问题。
    这里，一年四季是菜田常青，市场上蔬菜供应不断。
    千里送青菜
    淮安城蔬菜生产大发展，有力地支援了兄弟城市和工矿区人民的蔬菜需要。
    这方面的事情，说来是很多的。例如，1月份，有一位来自福建前线的客人，要买一部分咸菜。副食品经理部听到这个消息后，连晚召开了加工人员会议，赶制三千多斤质量精美的红大片，满足了外来旅客的需要。据这个经理部统计，从1月到5月底，通过加工调给上海、旅大等地的红大片、大头菜等十五种咸菜就有一千零七十万斤。调给徐州工矿区的各种鲜菜达一百二十多万斤。目前仍在源源外调。当地菜农和蔬菜市场的人员，为了使工人老大哥吃到好菜，都拣质量好的外调。
    淮沭新河沭阳工程队为了感谢淮安城支援的蔬菜，在赠送的一面红旗上写道：“千里送青菜，协作友谊深！”
    但是，这里的人们，并不满足已取得的成绩，他们表示要继续鼓足干劲，生产更多更好的蔬菜支援大城市和工矿区。
