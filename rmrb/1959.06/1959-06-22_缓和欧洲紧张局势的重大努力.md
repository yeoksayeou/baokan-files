    A Major Effort to Ease European Tensions
    The delegation of the German Democratic Republic led by Comrades Ulbricht and Grotewohl has concluded its visit to the Soviet Union. During the visit, the Soviet party and government delegation headed by Comrade Khrushchev met with the delegation of the German Democratic Republic on several occasions to discuss the current international situation, guaranteeing European security, and various issues concerning Germany and West Berlin. In the joint communiqué issued the day before yesterday, the Soviet Union and Germany once again expressed their sincerity in seeking to resolve these issues, pointing out a realistic path to easing tensions in Europe. This new and significant effort by the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic to safeguard European peace and ease international tensions will be warmly welcomed by peace-loving countries and people around the world and will have a significant impact on the current international situation.
    The joint Soviet-German communiqué expressed serious concern about the current situation in Germany, which is entirely understandable. Because West Germany has embarked on the path of militarism and revanchism and is openly pursuing expansionist and aggressive goals, European peace and the security of European peoples are once again seriously threatened today. The ruling group in West Germany, headed by Adenauer, with the support of the United States, is preparing to arm the West German army with rockets and atomic weapons, so that West Germany can serve as the backbone of the North Atlantic aggressive bloc against the Soviet Union and the socialist countries of Europe. They have not learned the lessons they should have from history, and they are still trying to relive Hitler's old dreams. In order to pave the way for their rearmament and expansionist and aggressive policies, the West German government today stubbornly pursues the imperialist "policy of strength," striving to obstruct the rational solution of the German question and other major international issues that have matured, and obstruct the easing of international tensions. Obviously, if West Germany's situation is allowed to continue to develop uncontrollably, Germany will once again become a source of war, and the people of Europe, especially the German people themselves, will once again suffer disastrous consequences.
    In response to this situation, the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic have repeatedly put forward proposals to prevent the resurgence of West German militarism, to promote Germany's progress along the path of peace and democracy, and to guarantee European peace. Considering the long-term deadlock of the German question after the war and the reality that two Germanys exist simultaneously, the Soviet Union has recently proposed suggestions regarding ending the occupation regime in West Berlin and discussing and concluding a peace treaty with Germany. These proposals have been sincerely supported by the German people and widely supported by peace-loving people around the world. Under the strong pressure of world public opinion, the Western countries, which have consistently obstructed the solution of the German question, have also had to agree to convene the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference to negotiate with the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic.
    At the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference, the representatives of the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic made serious efforts to resolve these two urgent issues that had matured. The Soviet Union reiterated the importance of concluding a peace treaty with Germany and ending the occupation regime in West Berlin. In order to bring the views of both sides closer on certain specific issues, the Soviet Union has repeatedly absorbed some of the opinions and demands of Western countries. At the June 10 meeting, the Soviet Union took another important step, proposing an agreement on the interim regulations for West Berlin and a proposal on the All-German Committee. The German Democratic Republic fully supported the Soviet proposal and also put forward significant proposals to promote understanding and rapprochement between the two Germanys and to conclude a treaty of non-aggression between the two Germanys. This sincerity of the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic and the reasonable plans they put forward provided the Geneva Conference with the possibility of seeking an agreement on a realistic basis. If the Western countries had also shown the same sincerity and desire, the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference could have made progress in resolving the issue of concluding a peace treaty with Germany and the issue of the status of West Berlin.
    However, the situation at the conference for more than a month shows that the Western countries have not substantially changed their fundamental positions. The "package plan" and the plan on the Berlin issue they put forward reveal their intention to annex the German Democratic Republic and continue to forcibly occupy West Berlin. They use the issue of German reunification as a pretext to obstruct the timely solution of the peace treaty with Germany and the West Berlin issue. In fact, due to their common and individual goals, they themselves have no intention of resolving the issue of German reunification in the foreseeable future. What is even more important to point out is that the Western countries themselves not only do not give an inch, but instead vainly imagine that the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic will provide them with "legal" guarantees for the permanent illegal occupation of West Berlin. However, as emphasized in the communiqué of the visit of the delegation of the German Democratic Republic, the Soviet Union and Germany will never allow the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany to be delayed, nor can they agree to the Western countries maintaining the occupation regime in West Berlin indefinitely. If the Western countries continue to ignore this, then the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries will conclude a peace treaty with the German Democratic Republic and will take all necessary measures to eliminate the abnormal situation in West Berlin. At that time, the German Democratic Republic will enjoy all sovereignty. Comrade Khrushchev also warned the Western countries in advance: "If other countries attempt to restore the occupation regime by force, then the Soviet Union will support the German Democratic Republic with all the means at its disposal, and as a faithful ally of the Warsaw Pact, will defend the inviolability of the territory of the German Democratic Republic."
    This statement by the leaders of the Soviet Union and Germany should be a sobering agent for those Western politicians who treat fantasy as reality. The Western countries have long refused to recognize the existence of the German Democratic Republic. However, the Geneva Conference, in which the two Germanys participated with equal rights, clearly shows that it is impossible to discuss and resolve issues related to Germany without the participation of the German Democratic Republic; without recognizing the existence of the two Germanys, there can be no talk of German reunification. The German Democratic Republic represents the aspirations and interests of the entire German people and has been working to build a peaceful, democratic, and unified Germany. It has received the support of the broad masses of the German people and peace-loving people of all countries. Its international prestige is constantly increasing. No matter what means West Germany and Western countries use, they will never be able to achieve the despicable goal of annexing the German Democratic Republic. To solve the German question, it is necessary to recognize the existence and rights of the German Democratic Republic. The peaceful and democratic reunification of Germany must also be gradually realized through the mutual understanding and rapprochement of the two Germanys. The Western countries' current opposition to the principle of equality between the two Germanys and the approach and cooperation between East and West Germany on an equal footing can only show that they have no intention of realizing the reunification of Germany.
    The communiqué especially emphasized the importance of convening a summit conference. The Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference was originally tasked with preparing conditions for the convening of a summit conference. If the heads of government of various countries can gather to consult on some major international disputes and contribute to promoting the peaceful coexistence of countries with different social systems, it will help ease international tensions and create prospects for world peace. However, recent remarks by Western leaders indicate that they are attempting to use the summit conference as a means of bargaining with the Soviet Union, believing that whether or not the summit conference is held depends on the progress of the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference. On the other hand, they are obstructing the Geneva Conference from achieving genuine results. Under these circumstances, it is absolutely necessary for the leaders of the Soviet Union and Germany to once again express their hope for the convening of a summit conference. As Comrade Khrushchev said, "If the foreign ministers in Geneva fail to reach the necessary agreement, then a high-level meeting will be even more necessary." Now, at the request of the Western countries, the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference has decided to adjourn until July 13. The people of all countries are watching the next move of the Western countries. They demand that the Western countries change their current stubborn stance so that the Foreign Ministers' Conference can conduct serious negotiations on issues such as concluding a peace treaty with Germany, ending the occupation regime in West Berlin, and convening a summit conference after the resumption of the meeting.
    The leaders of the Soviet Union and Germany expressed their common concern for further strengthening the solidarity and cooperation between the two countries. The communiqué pointed out that "in the future, no effort should be spared to consolidate and develop the sincere brotherly friendship between the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic, and it is believed that this relationship is an important contribution to safeguarding and consolidating the cause of European peace." The brotherly friendship between the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic is an important link in the friendly unity between the countries of the socialist camp. The visit of the German Democratic Republic's party and government delegation to the Soviet Union and the joint proposal by the Soviet Union and Germany to ease European tensions show that the countries of the socialist camp are constantly consolidating their unity and unswervingly striving to safeguard peace and promote international cooperation.

### 缓和欧洲紧张局势的重大努力

    缓和欧洲紧张局势的重大努力
    以乌布利希和格罗提渥同志为首的德意志民主共和国党政代表团，已经结束了在苏联的访问。在访问期间，以赫鲁晓夫同志为首的苏联党政代表团同德意志民主共和国党政代表团曾经多次会见，讨论了当前国际局势、保障欧洲安全以及德国和西柏林局势的各种问题。在前天发表的访问公报中，苏德两国再一次表达了谋求解决这些问题的诚意，指出了缓和欧洲紧张局势的现实道路。苏联和德意志民主共和国为维护欧洲和平与缓和国际紧张局势而作的这种新的重大努力，必将受到全世界爱好和平的国家和人民的热烈欢迎，并对当前国际局势发生重大的影响。
    苏德两国联合公报对目前的德国局势首先表示了严重的关切，这是完全可以理解的。由于西德已经走上了军国主义和复仇主义的道路，并公然追求着扩张侵略的目的，欧洲和平和欧洲各国人民的安全今天重又受到了严重的威胁。以阿登纳为首的西德统治集团，在美国的支持下，正在准备用火箭和原子武器武装西德军队，以便使西德充当北大西洋侵略集团反对苏联和欧洲社会主义国家的骨干。他们没有从历史中汲取应有的教训，仍然企图重温希特勒的旧梦。为了给他们的重新武装和扩张侵略政策开辟道路，西德政府今天顽固不化地奉行着帝国主义的“实力政策”，竭力阻挠德国问题和其他已经成熟了的重大国际问题的合理解决，阻挠国际紧张局势的缓和。显然，如果听任西德的这种局势继续不受控制地发展下去，那么德国就会再一次成为战争的策源地，而欧洲各国人民，特别是德国人民自己，将再一次遭到灾难深重的后果。
    针对着这种局势，苏联和德意志民主共和国曾经一再提出过防止西德军国主义复活，促使德国沿着和平民主的道路向前发展以保障欧洲和平的建议。考虑到德国问题在战后长期陷于僵局而目前又同时存在着两个德国的现实情况，苏联最近又先后提出了关于结束西柏林占领制度与讨论和缔结对德和约的建议。这些建议得到了德国人民的衷心拥护和渴望和平的世界各国人民的广泛支持。在世界舆论的强大压力下，一贯阻挠德国问题解决的西方国家，也不得不同意召开日内瓦外长会议，同苏联和德意志民主共和国进行谈判。
    在日内瓦外长会议上，苏联和德意志民主共和国代表为解决这两个时机业已成熟了的迫切问题作了认真的努力。苏联重申了缔结对德和约和结束西柏林占领制度的重要性。为了使双方的观点在某些具体问题上得以接近起来，苏联曾不止一次地吸收了西方国家的某些意见和要求。在6月10日会议上，苏联又采取重要步骤，提出了关于签订西柏林临时法规的协定和关于全德委员会的建议。德意志民主共和国一方面完全支持苏联建议，同时也提出了促进两个德国的谅解接近和缔结两个德国互不侵犯条约的重大建议。苏联和德意志民主共和国的这种诚意和它们所提出的合理方案，为日内瓦会议提供了在现实的基础上寻求协议的可能。如果西方国家也表现出同样的诚意和愿望的话，日内瓦外长会议本来是能够在解决缔结对德和约问题和西柏林地位问题上取得进展的。
    但是一个多月来的会议情况说明，西方国家实质上并没有改变它们的根本立场。他们所提出的“一揽子计划”和关于柏林问题的方案，暴露了它们仍然企图兼并德意志民主共和国和继续强占西柏林的目的。它们以德国统一问题作为借口，来阻挠对德和约和西柏林问题的及时解决。而实际上由于它们共同的和各自的目的，它们自己并无意于在可以预见到的时期内解决德国统一问题。更应该指出的是，西方国家自己不但寸步不让，却反而妄想苏联和德意志民主共和国给它们永久非法占领西柏林提供“合法”的保证。但是，正如这次德意志民主共和国党政代表团的访问公报所强调指出的，苏德两国决不容许拖延缔结对德和约，也决不能同意西方国家无限期地保持西柏林的占领制度。如果西方国家仍然对此置之不理，那苏联和其他爱好和平的国家就将跟德意志民主共和国缔结和约，同时将采取一切必要的措施来消除西柏林的不正常局势。到那时，德意志民主共和国将享有一切主权。赫鲁晓夫同志并且预先警告西方国家说：“如果其他国家企图用武力恢复占领制度，那末，苏联将用它所掌握的一切手段支持德意志民主共和国，并且作为忠实的华沙条约的盟国，捍卫德意志民主共和国的领土的不可侵犯性。”
    苏德两国领导人的这个声明，对于那些以幻想当作现实的西方政治家来说，应该是一贴清醒剂。西方国家长期以来一贯拒绝承认德意志民主共和国的存在。但这次有两个德国以平等权利参加的日内瓦会议却再也清楚不过地说明：没有德意志民主共和国的参加，就无法讨论和解决有关德国的问题；不承认两个德国的存在，就谈不到什么德国的统一。德意志民主共和国代表着全德国人民的愿望和利益，一直在为建立一个和平、民主、统一的德国而努力。它得到了德国广大人民和爱好和平的各国人民的支持。它的国际威望正在不断提高。西德和西方国家不论用什么手段，都永远不可能达到并吞德意志民主共和国的可耻目的。要想解决德国问题，就必须承认德意志民主共和国的存在和权利。德国的和平民主统一也必须通过两个德国的互相谅解接近而逐步实现。西方国家现在反对两个德国的对等原则和东西德在平等基础上接近合作，只能说明它们无意于实现德国的重新统一。
    公报特别强调指出召开最高级会议的重要性。日内瓦外长会议本来负有为召开最高级会议准备条件的任务。如果各国政府首脑能够聚会就当前一些重大国际争端进行磋商，并为促进不同社会制度国家的和平共处作出贡献，就会有助于缓和国际紧张局势和创造世界和平的前景。但是西方国家领导人最近的言论表明，他们企图以最高级会议作为同苏联进行讨价还价的手段，认为最高级会议是否举行，要取决于日内瓦外长会议的进展。而另一方面他们却又阻挠日内瓦会议取得真正的成果。在这种情况之下，苏德两国领导人再一次表示对于召开最高级会议的希望，是完全必要的。正如赫鲁晓夫同志所说，“如果在日内瓦的外长们未能达成必要的协议，那么，高级会议就显得更加必要”。现在，根据西方国家的要求，日内瓦外长会议已决定休会到7月13日。各国人民正注视着西方国家的下一步行动。他们要求西方国家改变目前这种顽固立场，使外长会议能在复会以后就缔结对德和约、结束西柏林占领制度和召开最高级会议等问题进行认真的谈判。
    苏德两国领导人对进一步加强两国之间的团结合作表现了共同的关心。公报指出，“今后还要不遗余力地巩固并发展苏联和德意志民主共和国真挚的兄弟友谊，并且认为这种关系是对维护和巩固欧洲和平事业的重要贡献”。苏联和德意志民主共和国的兄弟友谊，是社会主义阵营各国之间友好团结的重要一环。德意志民主共和国党政代表团的访问苏联，和苏德两国这次对缓和欧洲紧张局势的共同主张，显示着社会主义阵营各国正在不断地巩固自己的团结，并坚持不渝地为维护和平与促进国际合作而努力。
