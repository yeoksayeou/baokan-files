    Creating Brilliant Achievements to Welcome the Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee
    Soviet Workers Launch Technical Innovation Craze
    (Our Dispatch) In the upsurge of the entire Soviet working people creating brilliant production achievements to welcome the June Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee, a socialist labor competition to vigorously promote mechanization and automation has been launched in factories and enterprises throughout the Soviet Union. Currently, this mass technical innovation movement is continuously rising.
    The Soviet people are striving to realize the resolutions of the 21st Congress of the CPSU and warmly support the Party's policy of widely adopting new technologies and implementing comprehensive mechanization and automation of production. The Soviet people call technological progress "the banner of the Seven-Year Plan," because technological progress is a decisive condition for successfully completing the Seven-Year Plan and establishing the material and technical foundations of communism.
    The decision of the CPSU Central Committee to convene the June Plenary Session, announced on May 10, greatly stimulated the political enthusiasm and production enthusiasm of the Soviet people. The working people on all production fronts have successively put forward action slogans to complete this year's plan indicators of the Seven-Year Plan ahead of schedule, increase output, and improve quality. To this end, they are widely exploring production potential, paying particular attention to solving technical innovation problems such as mechanization, automation, and updating old equipment, and putting forward various guarantee conditions to carry out socialist labor competitions.
    In order to better carry out this competition movement, the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions made six resolutions in mid-May: (1) Instruct trade union organizations at all levels to conscientiously summarize and promote good experiences in solving the comprehensive mechanization, automation, and updating of old equipment; (2) Ensure that the competition for comprehensive mechanization, automation, and updating of old equipment is more fully reflected in the socialist competition conditions for striving to complete the 1959 tasks and the Seven-Year Plan indicators ahead of schedule; promptly review and quickly adopt approved rationalization proposals; (3) Suggest that trade union organizations conscientiously discuss technical innovation issues at various production meetings and meetings of inventors and rationalization proposers in enterprises; (4) Convene experience exchange meetings on comprehensive mechanization, automation, etc., in thirteen major cities such as Moscow and Leningrad in May and June this year; (5) Instruct trade union organizations in various construction sites and factories to actively assist employees in realizing competition guarantee conditions; (6) Suggest that all trade union organizations lead the employees of construction sites and factories to greet the June Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee with new production achievements. On May 28, the Central Committee of the Soviet Komsomol specially invited leaders of factories, enterprises, transportation, and construction units to hold a meeting to discuss how the Komsomol can participate in the struggle to realize production automation and mechanization.
    This socialist competition movement carried out by Soviet factories, enterprises, and construction sites has a very wide scope. From Moscow to Alma-Ata, from Riga on the Baltic coast to the Urals, the vast number of employees of factories and enterprises in various places have taken action. In the Ural Machine-Building Plant alone, an average of one out of every four people is an active member of technical innovation; while in the Moscow "Vladimir Ilyich" Factory, one out of every three people is an active member of rationalization proposals and invention work. In this movement, local organizations of the CPSU, economic committees, and trade union organizations continue to give play to the initiative of their work, actively put forward initiatives, and promote the progress of the competition. The Vladimirsk Oblast Committee of the CPSU and the Vladimirsk Economic Committee put forward an initiative in mid-May: to rebuild and expand enterprises and better utilize existing equipment in order to maximize the saving of funds and increase production. This initiative has received enthusiastic support from the vast number of employees in many places such as Leningrad, the Ural region, and Yerevan. "Supporting and responding to the practices of the Vladimir people" has formed a widespread call.
    This socialist competition to realize comprehensive mechanization and automation has many characteristics.
    Give full play to the wisdom of the masses in the competition movement, and mobilize every worker to contribute to technical innovation, no matter how small. For example, many automated and semi-automated complex machines and equipment installed in the workshops of the Leningrad "Lepse" steel frame factory were all made by local rationalization proposers and inventors. Another example is that the employees of a factory in Lutuginsk that produces rolling rolls put forward the slogan of "small mechanization movement" in the competition, and everyone from gray-haired old workers to apprentices who just graduated from technical schools participated in the technical innovation movement. Technical innovation deeds have appeared in every workplace.
    The competition movement pays special attention to tapping all production potential. For example, the employees of the "Malyshev" Bearing Factory in Kharkov and the State-owned No. 1 Bearing Factory use the method of exploring internal potential to realize automation. The rationalization proposers of these two factories also proposed to establish a "technical innovation fund" for the Seven-Year Plan with the funds saved by rationalization proposals. Another example is that the Perm Telephone Factory merged several workshops in the movement, allowing engineering and technical personnel to hold concurrent posts, and drew out fifty engineers to establish a "new technology workshop and design office" specializing in the study of automation problems without reducing the original production indicators. They cooperated with rationalization proposers and inventors, and established many automated devices in the factory within a few months, reducing manual labor in the factory from 50% to 38%.
    Combining production with science, and combining workers' rationalization proposals and inventions with the guidance of scientific research departments, is also an important issue in this movement. For example, the workers of the Kharkov Bearing Factory worked together with fifteen scientific research institutions and universities in the process of carrying out comprehensive mechanization, automation, and technical innovation. Many trade unions also pay attention to helping employees improve their cultural and scientific knowledge.
    The combination of workers, engineers, and technicians is also a noteworthy form in this movement. For example, the "Creative Cooperation Working Team" was established at the Lisichansk United Factory in Donbass. This working team is an organization that combines workers, engineers, and technicians, and they jointly study technical innovation and promote new technology. Such organizations have been established in various workshops of this factory.
    In this competition movement, various forms and activities were organized to attract the masses to participate in technical innovation. Many factories have also established "Komsomol Headquarters for Promoting New Technology," generally composed of advanced Komsomol producers and technicians, focusing on studying the plans formulated by experts for renovating and expanding factories, helping workers solve difficult problems in production, and organizing young workers to visit and making study plans for them. Other activities, such as many factories carrying out movements to improve production skills, holding rationalization proposal months, and ordering production teams and individual seven-year plans, are also being carried out very actively.
    The vast number of employees participating in this competition movement, as well as the Party, government, trade union, and Komsomol organizations, are all paying attention to the issue of how to regularize the technical innovation movement. The members of the communist labor teams of many enterprises are striving to make technical innovation a constant goal of struggle. The Pervouralsk New Steel Pipe Factory has also established a "permanent rationalization proposer working team." The members have already formulated a plan to automate basic and auxiliary equipment.

    创造辉煌成绩迎接苏共中央全会
    苏联工人掀起技术革新热潮
    本报讯　在苏联全体劳动人民以创造辉煌的生产成绩迎接苏共中央六月全会的热潮中，苏联各地的工厂企业中掀起了一个大搞机械化、自动化的社会主义劳动竞赛。目前，这一群众性的技术革新运动正在不断地高涨中。
    苏联人民努力实现苏共第二十一次代表大会决议，热烈拥护党所提出的广泛采用新技术、实行生产的全盘机械化、自动化的方针。苏联人民把技术进步称为“七年计划的旗帜”，因为技术进步是顺利地完成七年计划和建立共产主义物质技术基础的决定性条件。
    5月10日苏共中央发表的关于召开六月全会的决定，大大地激发了苏联人民的政治热情和生产积极性。在各个生产战线上的劳动人民，纷纷提出提前完成七年计划的今年度计划指标、增加产量、提高质量的行动口号。为此，他们广泛地发掘生产潜力，特别是注意解决机械化、自动化、更新旧设备等技术革新问题，并且提出各种保证条件，开展社会主义劳动竞赛。
    为了更好地开展这一竞赛运动，全苏工会中央理事会于5月中旬作出六项决议：（一）责成各级工会组织认真总结和推广解决全盘机械化、自动化和更新旧设备问题中的优良经验；（二）保证在争取提前完成1959年任务和七年计划指标的社会主义竞赛条件中，更充分地反映为全盘机械化、自动化和更新旧设备而开展的竞赛；尽快地审查和从速采用已批准的合理化建议；（三）建议工会组织在企业的各种生产会议、发明者和合理化建议者会议上认真讨论技术革新问题；（四）于今年5、6月间在莫斯科、列宁格勒等十三个大城市召开全盘机械化、自动化等经验交流会议；（五）责成各工地和工厂企业的工会组织积极地协助职工实现竞赛保证条件；（六）建议所有的工会组织领导工地和工厂企业的职工，以新的生产成就迎接苏共中央六月全会。5月28日，苏联共青团中央特地邀请工厂企业、运输和建筑单位领导人举行会议，讨论共青团如何参加为实现生产自动化、机械化而斗争的问题。
    苏联各工厂企业和建筑工地开展的这一社会主义竞赛运动，具有非常广泛的规模。从莫斯科到阿拉木图，从波罗的海之滨的里加到乌拉尔，各地工厂企业的广大职工都行动起来了。仅乌拉尔机器制造厂，平均每四个人中就有一个技术革新的积极分子；而莫斯科“弗拉基米尔·伊里奇”工厂，则每三个人当中就有一个合理化建议和发明工作的积极分子。在这次运动中，苏共各地方组织、经济委员会、工会组织，不断地发挥工作的主动性，积极提出倡议，推动竞赛的进展。苏共弗拉基米尔斯克州委和弗拉基米尔斯克经济委员会在5月中提出了一项倡议：以重建、扩建企业及更好地利用现有设备，以便最大限度地节省资金，增加生产。这一倡议得到列宁格勒、乌拉尔地区以及埃里温等许多地方广大职工的热烈支持。“拥护和响应弗拉基米人的作法”已形成一个广泛的号召。
    这次为实现全盘机械化、自动化的社会主义竞赛有着许多特点。
    在竞赛运动中充分发挥群众的智慧，动员每一个工人不分巨细地对技术革新作出贡献。例如，列宁格勒“列普塞”钢架工厂各车间装置的许多自动化和半自动化的复杂机器设备，都是当地合理化建议者和发明工作者一手制成的。又如，鲁图金斯克的一个生产轧滚的工厂职工，在竞赛中提出“小机械化运动”口号，从头发斑白的老工人起直到刚从工艺学校毕业的徒工，都参加了技术革新运动。每一个工作场所都出现了技术革新的事迹。
    竞赛运动中特别注意挖掘一切生产潜力。例如，哈尔科夫的“马雷舍夫”轴承工厂和国营第一轴承工厂的职工，就用发掘内部潜力的办法来实现自动化。这两个工厂的合理化建议者还倡议，用合理化建议所节省的资金建立七年计划的“技术革新基金”。又如，白尔姆电话工厂在运动中合并了几个车间，让工程技术人员兼职，在不降低原有生产指标的情况下抽出了五十名工程师成立了一个“新工艺车间和设计室”，专门研究自动化问题。他们同合理化建议者和发明者合作，几个月内就在厂内建立了不少自动化装置，使厂内手工劳动由50％减少到38％。
    生产同科学结合，工人合理化建议、发明同科学研究部门指导相结合，也是这次运动中一个重要的问题。例如，哈尔科夫的轴承工厂工人，在大搞全盘机械化、自动化和技术革新中，同十五个科学研究机关、大专学校共同进行工作。许多工会还注意帮助职工提高文化科学知识水平。
    工人、工程师、技术员互相结合，也是这次运动中值得注意的形式。例如，顿巴斯利西昌斯克联合厂成立“创造性合作工作队”的作法。这种工作队是一种工人、工程师、技师相结合的组织，他们共同研究技术革新和推行新技术的问题。这一工厂的各个车间都成立了这种组织。
    在这次竞赛运动中，组织多种多样的形式和活动吸引群众参加技术革新。不少工厂还成立了“共青团推广新技术参谋部”，一般由共青团先进生产者和技术人员组成，着重研究专家制订的改建和扩建工厂的计划，在生产中帮助工人解决困难问题，并组织青年工人参观，为他们订学习计划等。其他如许多工厂开展提高生产技能运动，举行合理化建议月、订生产队和个人七年计划等，都进行得十分活跃。
    参加这次竞赛运动的广大职工，以及党、政府、工会、共青团组织都注意如何使技术革新运动经常化的问题。许多企业的共产主义劳动队队员，力求把技术革新成为经常奋斗的目标。佩尔沃乌拉尔斯克新钢管厂还建立了“经常性的合理化建议者工作队”。队员们已经制定了一个使基本设备和辅助设备自动化的计划。
