Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 10th: The Jiaozuo Mining Bureau is vigorously strengthening tunneling work to ensure continuous large-scale high coal production. In May, the mines under the bureau handed over a total of seven reserve working faces, providing enough coal for more than four months of mining. In June, another six to seven reserve working faces will be handed over.

In the previous period, the tunneling progress of the mines under the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau was relatively slow, lagging behind the requirements of coal mining, which affected normal production. For example, in the Li Feng Mine, due to the failure to replace the reserve working faces in February and March, the daily output dropped from around 3,500 tons to 2,700 tons. In the past month or so, the Mining Bureau has taken measures to strengthen the leadership of tunneling work in all aspects. Each mine has a deputy director who goes deep into the tunneling faces to analyze and solve problems in tunneling in a timely manner. At the same time, the tunneling force has been strengthened. Various tunneling teams have promoted many advanced experiences and launched a competition to advance one meter or two meters per tunneling work day, which has rapidly improved tunneling efficiency and ensured the on-time completion of the tunneling plan. At present, the mines have basically reversed the tense situation of working face replacement. Except for one coal mining face where the time of mining completion and the time of delivery of the replacement face are just in time, the remaining replacement faces can be delivered in advance.

    力争煤炭大面积连续丰产
    焦作矿务局大抓掘进
    新华社郑州10日电　焦作矿务局大力加强掘进工作，保证煤炭连续大面积丰产。5月份，矿务局所属各矿共交出七个备用工作面，提供了可供开采四个多月的煤量，6月份还要交出六个到七个备用工作面。
    前一时期，焦作矿务局所属各矿掘进进度比较迟缓，赶不上采煤的要求，影响了正常生产。像李封矿，2、3月份就因为备用工作面接替不上，日产量由原来的三千五百吨左右下降到二千七百吨。最近一个多月以来，矿务局采取措施从各方面来加强掘进工作的领导，各矿都有一个副矿长深入掘进工作面，及时分析和解决掘进中的问题，同时充实了掘进力量。各个掘进组推广了很多先进经验，开展每个掘进工日进一公尺、两公尺的竞赛运动，使掘进效率迅速提高，保证了掘进计划的按期完成。目前各矿已经基本上扭转了工作面接替紧张的局面。除了有一个采煤工作面采完煤的时间和接替工作面交出的时间正好衔接以外，其余的接替工作面都可以预先交出。（附图片）
