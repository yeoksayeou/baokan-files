    Materialist Working Methods
    Materialism is a world view, and also a methodology. The basic characteristics of materialist thought and working methods are to acknowledge that objective reality exists independently of people's subjective consciousness, and that people's subjective world can only be a reflection of the objective world. According to this view, no matter what ideas we come up with or what we do, we must proceed from objective reality, not from subjective wishes, and we must follow the laws of objective things, not violate them.
    It is not simple and easy for the subjective to be consistent with the objective, and for the subjective to correctly reflect the objective. The objective world is complex and ever-changing. If we do not go through countless practices, grasp a large number of facts, and conduct in-depth analysis and research, it will be difficult to correctly understand problems. In particular, social phenomena are more complex, and cannot be taken to the laboratory for qualitative or quantitative analysis like the objects studied by natural sciences. To study things in society, we can only rely on investigation and research, careful observation, to collect materials, and use abstract methods to understand its regularity. Precisely because of this, our understanding can often only approximately reflect the objective reality, and it is difficult to accurately reflect the objective reality one hundred percent. From this, we can draw a principle for doing things: When arranging anything, we should leave as much room as possible and use a safety factor. Leaving room for increase targets and striving to exceed them in practice is a materialist approach.
    We say that people's understanding can often only approximately reflect the objective reality, and it is difficult to accurately reflect the objective reality one hundred percent, which is completely different from the views of skeptics. Marxists believe that only people's social practice is the criterion for the truthfulness of people's understanding of the outside world. Whether the crystallization of people's understanding of the outside world—all theories and plans, etc.—is truth needs to wait until the results of practice to be judged. In order to grasp the truth and obtain the truth at a lower cost, the method is to conduct pilot projects or experiments. We emphasize everything through experiments for agricultural technology reforms, and the reason is here. "Everything through experiments" is also a materialist working method.
    When we talk about materialism, it is dialectical materialism, not mechanical materialism. According to the viewpoint of dialectical materialism, people's social existence determines people's consciousness; however, human consciousness is not without effect on the objective world. There are two things that must be followed to give play to people's subjective initiative: First, we must proceed from certain objective conditions to determine tasks. It is wrong to regard objective conditions as dead, which is "conditionalism". However, it is also impossible to blindly do things that conditions do not yet allow without looking at the conditions at all. Second, we must follow the laws of development of objective things. Only in this way can people's subjective initiative be correctly exerted and can the greatest effect be achieved. (Extracted from "Thought Emancipation" No. 11 in Guangxi, author: Fei Kewen)
      Talking About "Degree"
    Everything has a degree. Degree is the unity of the quality and quantity of things: a certain quality and a certain quantity are mutually adapted; without a certain quantity, there is no certain quality; within a certain limit, the increase or decrease in quantity will not affect the quality of things. If it exceeds the limit, it will destroy the degree of things, that is, destroy the unity of quality and quantity, causing qualitative changes. Burning wood to cook rice is to cook the rice thoroughly. If the fire is too small, the rice will not cook thoroughly, and if the fire is too large, the rice will be burnt. Eating is to maintain physical health. Eating too little will not fill you up, and eating too much will be indigestible. All of this shows that degree is an objective existence.
    We should be good at using the principle of degree to guide our work: destroying the degree of old things and controlling the degree of new things. Whether it is carrying out social struggle or fighting against nature, it is nothing more than changing the old to obtain new things. Therefore, we must first consider how to destroy the degree of old things. Things change from quantitative change to qualitative change, but quantitative change will not lead to qualitative change if it does not exceed the limit and reach a certain critical point. Water cannot boil at ninety-nine degrees; it can only boil when it reaches the critical point of one hundred degrees. The saying "ready to go" refers to things that are approaching the critical point. As long as there is a slight increase in quantity, it will erupt. In our work, we must be good at finding the critical points of things, so as to promote quantitative changes and cause qualitative changes in things.
    A new thing has its new degree. If the new degree is not controlled and the quantitative changes continue to develop, exceeding the limit, things will undergo new changes and move toward their opposite. The saying "too much is as bad as too little" is the same reason. Song Yu described a woman as very beautiful. He said that if she "increased it by one point, she would be too tall; if she reduced it by one point, she would be too short; if she applied powder, she would be too white; if she applied rouge, she would be too red." This means that beauty also has a limit. If it exceeds the limit, beauty will turn into ugliness. It is unacceptable for a person to be inferior. They should have self-esteem, but if self-esteem goes too far, it will become arrogance. It is unacceptable for a person to be cowardly. They should be brave, but if bravery goes too far, it will become recklessness. Therefore, when carrying out work, we must pay close attention to quantitative changes, both destroying the degree of old things and controlling the degree of new things, and doing things appropriately. Otherwise, what we get will not be what we need. (Extracted from "Truth and Falsehood" No. 6 in Anhui, author: Zheng Yingnian)
      "Planning" and "Decisiveness"
    The four words "careful planning and decisive action" are concise and comprehensive, containing very profound and vivid dialectical thoughts. First, we must plan carefully before we can act decisively. Careful planning is the basis and prerequisite for decisive action; otherwise, it is subjective speculation and ill-considered arbitrary decisions. Second, careful planning must be based on decisive action. Careful planning is for decisive action. Planning without action, planning but no decisiveness, is armchair strategy.
      The most essential meaning of "careful planning" is to follow the mass line. This is what Comrade Mao Zedong often said, "Discuss things with the masses." Only by concentrating the wisdom of the masses is the greatest wisdom. Lenin said: "To truly understand things, we must grasp and study all aspects, all connections, and 'intermediaries' of it." Therefore, we must treat the different opinions of the masses in a realistic manner and not choose them based on personal preferences. Only by truthfully reflecting the various opinions and views of the masses, so that our sensory experience has objective reliability, can we make correct judgments.
    Decisive action must be prompt and decisive. First, we must have a keen political sense and be good at observing the situation. During the period of revolution and construction, there were thousands of things to be done, and the development and changes of objective situations were very rapid. On the one hand, we must promptly modify and correct our original wrong understandings, plans, and programs that do not conform to the objective situation; at the same time, we must be good at shifting our subjective understanding with the development and changes of objective things, even the new tasks, programs, and the proposals of plans adapt to the changes in the new situation.
    Second, we must have a communist style, dare to uphold the truth, correct mistakes, not follow the crowd, and not act according to "atmosphere". Where the truth is, we turn to it; who the truth is with, we support. Only by achieving the above two points can we truly achieve "careful planning and decisive action" and "prompt and decisive action".

    唯物主义的工作方法
    唯物主义是世界观，也是方法论。唯物主义的思想方法和工作方法的基本特征，就是承认客观现实不依赖人们的主观意识而独立存在，人们的主观世界只能是客观世界的反映。根据这个观点，我们无论出个什么主意，做件什么事情，都必须从客观实际出发，而不能从主观愿望出发，都必须遵循客观事物的发展规律，而不能违反这种规律。
    主观与客观一致，主观正确地反映客观，并不是一件简单容易的事。客观世界纷繁错杂，变化万端，我们若不是经过反复无数次的实践，掌握大量的事实，进行深入的分析研究，就很难正确认识问题。特别是社会现象，更加复杂，又不能像自然科学所研究的对象那样，拿到实验室里去进行定性或定量的分析。研究社会上的事情，只能依靠调查研究，细心观察，去收集材料，用抽象的方法，去认识它的规律性。正因为如此，我们的认识往往只能近似地反映客观实际，而很难能够做到百分之百准确地反映客观实际。从这里就可以得出一条办事的原则：我们在安排任何事情的时候，都应该尽可能地留点余地，打个保险系数。在增产指标上留点余地，而在实践中争取超过，这是唯物主义的做法。
    我们说人的认识往往只能近似地反映客观实际，而很难能够做到百分之百准确地反映客观实际，这同怀疑派的观点是完全不相同的。马克思主义者认为，只有人们的社会实践，才是人们对于外界认识的真理性的标准。人们对外界认识的结晶——一切理论和计划等等之是否真理，都需要等到实践得出结果才能判定。人们为了掌握真理，要以较小的代价去获得真理，办法就是通过试点或试验。对于农业上的技术改革，我们强调一切通过试验，其道理即在于此。“一切通过试验”，这也是一条唯物主义的工作方法。
    我们讲唯物主义，是辩证唯物主义，而不是机械唯物主义。按照辩证唯物主义的观点，人们的社会存在决定人们的意识；可是，人的意识对客观世界并不是毫无作用的。发挥人的主观能动性必须遵守两条：第一，必须从一定的客观条件出发，去决定任务。把客观条件看得过死，是“唯条件论”，是不对的。但是，完全不看条件，盲目去干那些条件还不允许干的事情，也是不可能成功的。第二，必须遵循客观事物的发展规律。只有这样，人的主观能动性才能得到正确的发挥，才能收到最大的效果。（摘自广西“思想解放”第十一期作者费克文）
      谈“度”
    每个事物都有个度。度就是事物的质和量的统一：一定的质和一定的量是相互适应的，没有一定的量就没有一定的质；在一定的限度之内，量的增减不会影响事物的质，如果超过了限度，就会破坏事物的度，即破坏质和量的统一，引起质的变化。烧火煮饭是为了把饭煮熟，火小了饭煮不熟，火大了饭就烧焦了。吃饭是为了维护身体健康，吃少了就吃不饱，吃多了又消化不了。如此等等，无不说明度是客观的存在。
    我们作工作要善于运用度的原理来指导工作：破坏旧事物的度，控制新事物的度。作社会斗争也好，向自然作斗争也好，无非是要改变旧的东西而获得新生的东西，因此我们首先要考虑如何破坏旧事物的度。事物是由量变到质变，然而量变不超过限度，不到一定的关节点就不会发生质变。水在九十九度不能开，只有达到一百度这个关节点才能开。平常说“一触即发”，就是指的事物快到关节点，只要稍有量的增加，就会发作起来。我们在工作中要善于找到事物的关节点，从而促进量的变化，使事物发生质变。
    一个新的事物又有它的新的度。如果不控制新的度，让量的变化继续发展下去，超过了限度，事物又会发生新的变化，走向它的反面。平常说：“过犹不及”，就是这个道理。宋玉形容一个女子很美，他说她“增之一分则太长，减之一分则太短，著粉则太白，施朱则太赤”，这就是说美也有一个限度，超过了限度，美就变为丑。一个人自卑要不得，应该自尊，而自尊过了头就会变成骄傲。一个人懦弱要不得，应该勇敢，而勇敢过了头就会变成鲁莽。所以在进行工作的时候，要密切注意量的变化，既要破坏旧事物的度，又要控制新事物的度，做到适可而止。否则，我们所得到的东西，就不是我们所需要的东西。（摘自安徽“虚与实”第六期作者郑英年）
      “谋”和“断”
    多谋善断四个字，言简意赅，包含着非常深刻而生动的辩证法思想。第一，必须多谋，而后才能善断，多谋是善断的基础和前提，否则就是主观臆断和少谋武断。第二，多谋又必须以善断为归宿，多谋是为了善断，谋而不断，有谋无断，就是纸上谈兵。
      “多谋”最本质的含义就是走群众路线。这就是毛泽东同志经常说的，“有事和群众商量”。只有集中群众的智慧，才是最大的智慧。列宁说：“要真正地认识事物，就必须把握、研究它的一切方面，一切联系和‘中介’。”所以对于群众的不同意见，一定要实事求是地对待，不凭个人爱恶来取舍。只有如实地反映群众各方面意见和看法，使我们的感觉经验具有客观可靠性，才可以使我们作出正确的判断。
    善断，必须是当机立断。第一，要有锐敏的政治嗅觉，善于观察形势。革命和建设时期，千头万绪，客观情况的发展变化是很迅速的。一方面要及时修改和纠正自己原来不符合于客观情况的错误认识、计划和方案；同时要善于使自己的主观认识随着客观事物的发展变化而推移转变，即使新的任务、方案和计划的提出，适合于新的情况的变化。
    第二，要有共产主义风格，敢于坚持真理，修正错误，不随风倒，不按“空气”办事。真理在哪里，就倒向哪里，真理在谁，就赞成谁。只有做到上述两点，才能真正做到“多谋善断”，“当机立断”。
