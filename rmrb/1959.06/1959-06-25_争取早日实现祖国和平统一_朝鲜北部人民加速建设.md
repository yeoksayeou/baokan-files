Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, June 23rd: Our correspondent reports: The laboring people of northern Korea, in order to drive out the American aggressor troops from their own land as soon as possible and realize the peaceful reunification of the motherland, are accelerating socialist construction. Workers are launching a vigorous labor emulation campaign, determined to complete the First Five-Year Plan more than two years ahead of schedule before this year's "August 15th"; the peasants have also demonstrated a high degree of labor enthusiasm, are vigorously engaged in water conservancy construction and actively carrying out various agricultural activities, striving for a greater harvest.

In the six years since the war, the people of northern Korea have not only healed the heavy wounds of war, but have also greatly developed industrial and agricultural production. Last year, the industrial products of northern Korea had already reached four times that of 1944 before liberation, and in terms of agricultural production, 3.7 million tons of grain were harvested.

This year, the people of northern Korea have launched an even greater upsurge in socialist construction. In the first quarter of this year, the total industrial output value of northern Korea increased by 80% compared with the same period last year, and recently 25 light industrial factories have completed their production plans for the first half of the year ahead of schedule. The steelworkers of Korea, encouraged by the slogan "Steel and machinery are the kings of industry" put forward by the Workers' Party, are fighting to double steel production within one or two years. In March of this year, two blast furnaces at the Kim Chaek Ironworks have been rebuilt and completed. At present, northern Korea already has three modern large blast furnaces, each with a daily output of more than 800 tons, which is two to three times more than during the Japanese rule.

The staff and workers of various machinery factories and factory repair shops in northern Korea have launched a movement of factories producing factories and machine tools producing machine tools. They are determined to double the number of machine tools currently available in northern Korea before the "May 1st" International Labor Day next year.

The textile workers of northern Korea are launching a production competition to produce 200 million meters of cloth this year. Workers at the Pyongyang Textile Factory are launching a movement to take better care of machines. Since late May, the factory's daily cotton yarn production has increased to more than 56 tons, creating the highest record since the factory was built. This factory will produce 96 million feet of cloth this year.

The peasants of northern Korea launched a high tide of water conservancy construction last winter and spring. During this period, northern Korea expanded the irrigated area by more than 350,000 chongbo, which is equivalent to the total irrigated area expanded in the thirteen years from liberation to September last year. During this period, the peasants also accumulated more than four times as much fertilizer as in previous years and implemented deep plowing. Farmers in many places have now begun harvesting wheat. This year's wheat production in South Hwanghae Province, the largest wheat-producing area in northern Korea, is expected to double last year's.

    争取早日实现祖国和平统一
    朝鲜北部人民加速建设
    新华社平壤23日电　本社记者报道：朝鲜北部的劳动人民为了早日从他们自己的国土上赶走美国侵略军队，实现祖国的和平统一，正在加速进行社会主义建设。工人们正在展开轰轰烈烈的劳动竞赛，决心要在今年“八一五”以前提前两年多完成第一个五年计划；农民们也发挥了高度的劳动热情，正在大修水利和积极进行各种农事活动，争取更大的丰收。
    战后六年来，朝鲜北部人民不仅医好了惨重的战争创伤，而且使工农业生产获得很大的发展。去年，朝鲜北部的工业产品已经达到了解放前1944年的四倍，在农业生产方面则收获了三百七十万吨粮食。
    今年，朝鲜北部人民掀起了更大的社会主义建设高潮。今年第一季度，朝鲜北部的工业总产值比去年同期增长了80％，最近已经有二十五个轻工业工厂提前完成上半年的生产计划。朝鲜的钢铁工人在劳动党提出的“钢铁和机械是工业之王”的口号的鼓舞下，正为在一、两年内使钢铁产量翻一番而斗争。今年3月，金策制铁所已经有两座高炉改建完工。目前，朝鲜北部已经有三座现代化的大高炉，每座的日产量都达到八百吨以上，比日本统治时期增加了两倍到三倍。
    朝鲜北部各机械厂和各工厂修配车间的职工们，展开了工厂生产工厂、机床生产机床的运动。他们决心在明年“五一”国际劳动节前使朝鲜北部现有的机床数翻一番。
    朝鲜北部的纺织工人们则正在为在今年内生产二亿公尺布而展开生产竞赛。平壤纺织工厂的工人们正在展开多看机器的运动。这个厂自从5月下旬以来，每天的棉纱产量已经增加到五十六吨以上，创造了建厂以来的最高纪录。这个厂今年要生产九千六百万尺布。
    朝鲜北部的农民们在去冬今春掀起了兴修水利的高潮。在这期间，朝鲜北部扩大了三十五万多町步的灌溉面积，这相当于解放后到去年9月为止十三年来扩大的灌溉面积的总和。在这期间，农民们还积了比往年多四倍以上的肥料，实行了深耕。许多地方的农民现在已经开始收割小麦。朝鲜北部最大的产麦区黄海南道今年的小麦产量预计要比去年增加一倍。
