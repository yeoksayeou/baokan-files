　　From the Readers

　　Recovering Nails from Discarded Boards
　　The Party organization of a certain work area of the Lanzhou 62 Engineering Bureau mobilized over a hundred staff members from various departments to recover nails from discarded wooden boards on the construction site during their spare time, retrieving over three thousand catties of nails in ten days.
　　I believe this method is worth promoting in all basic construction units.　Wang Huaixin

　　A Reminder to Comrades Mailing Letters Home
　　After the establishment of the people's communes, many people working away from home often only write the name of the commune and the recipient's name on the envelope, without specifying the village. This is inappropriate because most people's communes are now as large as a former district. Writing only the recipient's name within such a large area creates great difficulties for delivery. It is hoped that senders will, in addition to writing the name of the commune, also indicate the village name to facilitate delivery.
　　Xing Chunze, Weisengzhai People's Commune, Guan County, Shandong

　　Five Extra Feet of Cloth
　　When Comrade Wang Fu of a certain PLA unit stationed in Jilin went to Sichuan on a business trip, he bought one zhang five chi of "Oriental Ni" (fabric) at the Yibin Department Store. When he returned to Jilin to have clothes made at a tailoring shop, he found there were five extra chi. He thought: This must be the result of a careless sales clerk who measured too much. Therefore, he immediately went to the post office to remit the price of the extra five chi to the Yibin Department Store and wrote a letter explaining the reason.　Jiao Guangzhong

    废板上起铁钉
    兰州62工程处某工区党组织发动各科室百余名工作人员，利用工余时间，从施工现场废木板中起铁钉，曾经在十天内起出了三千多斤铁钉。
    我认为这个办法值得在各基本建设施工单位推广。　王怀信
    告邮家信的同志
    人民公社化以后，许多在外工作的人往家里寄信，信封上常常不写村名，而只写某某公社某某人收。这样写法很不恰当。因为现在的人民公社大都相当于过去一个区那样大，在这样大的范围内只写人名，就给投递造成了很大困难。希望寄信人除写上某某公社外，还要注明是哪个村的，便于投递。

    多了五尺布
    解放军驻吉林某部王富同志出差去四川的时候，在宜宾市百货商店买了一丈五尺东方呢。当他回到吉林去缝纫商店做衣服时，发现多了五尺。他想：这一定是售货员工作马虎，多量出来的。于是他马上去邮局把多量的五尺折成价款汇给宜宾市百货商店，并且写了一封信，说明原因。　焦广忠
