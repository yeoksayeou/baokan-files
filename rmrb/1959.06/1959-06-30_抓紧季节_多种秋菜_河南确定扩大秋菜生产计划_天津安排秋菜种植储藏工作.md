Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 29th: Henan Province's autumn vegetable planting area will reach more than 6,610,000 mu, an increase of 16% over last year's autumn vegetable area, with an average of more than 0.013 mu of vegetable land per person in the province.

The Henan Provincial People's Committee recently held a provincial vegetable production and supply conference, which proposed the above-mentioned autumn vegetable production plan. In order to ensure that autumn vegetables are well planted and in sufficient quantities, the meeting required that in addition to planning permanent vegetable fields, all localities should promote crop rotation between grain and vegetables according to local conditions. Government agencies, industrial and mining enterprises, and military units should also use vacant land to grow vegetables, striving for partial self-sufficiency in vegetables. Because vegetable production is highly technical and labor-intensive, all localities are required to widely organize specialized production teams, extensively teach vegetable production techniques, and vigorously promote tool reform in vegetable fields. Where conditions permit, mechanized farming and wells should be developed. In terms of fertilizer, in addition to allocating 11.7 million jin of chemical fertilizer specifically for vegetable fertilizer, all localities are required to vigorously accumulate manure and miscellaneous local fertilizers. All localities are also required to achieve self-propagation, self-selection, self-retention, and self-use of vegetable seeds.

The meeting also called for a vigorous mass vegetable processing effort, pickling dried vegetables and salted vegetables, to achieve storage in the peak season and sales in the off-season, ensuring continuous supply in the off-season, preventing spoilage in the peak season, and ensuring a balanced supply throughout the year. The relevant provincial departments have also allocated a sum of funds for basic construction investments needed for processing vegetables in various localities.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 29th: The Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Municipal People's Committee are implementing the policy of focusing on vegetable production in the agriculture of the near suburbs of the city. As summer vegetables begin to be available in large quantities, they have also made early arrangements for the production of autumn vegetables, and are doing a good job in preparing for the planting, storage, and transportation of autumn vegetables.

Recently, the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Municipal People's Committee specially convened a meeting on autumn vegetable production, deciding to expand the planting area of vegetables in the near suburbs to about 250,000 mu, an increase of 80% over last year's autumn vegetable planting area. It required that the people's communes and production teams in the near suburbs formulate plans and specific measures based on the needs of vegetable production in terms of the allocation of cultivated land area, labor arrangements, fertilizer, and other materials. In terms of labor arrangements, it is necessary to resolutely organize specialized teams for garden production, and to organize experienced commune members who were originally engaged in garden production into specialized teams. In terms of fertilizer, it is necessary to rely on the masses to launch a fertilizer accumulation campaign, to open up fertilizer sources in every possible way, and to make full use of urban sewage sludge and manure. At the same time, urban government agencies, factories, schools, and streets should vigorously accumulate fertilizer in conjunction with the summer sanitation campaign to support vegetable production in the suburbs. The meeting pointed out that in order to regulate the supply of vegetables during the off-season and peak season and ensure a balanced supply of vegetables, it is necessary to do a good job in the storage and processing of vegetables. In addition to mobilizing commune members to dig up materials and build small kilns and soil kilns without wood, each commune should also take measures such as digging pits and burying them with soil to store autumn vegetables in a timely manner; government agencies, enterprises, and schools should also store large quantities of pickled and dried autumn vegetables. At present, all suburbs have begun to take action. Many production teams have formulated measures to ensure a bumper harvest of Chinese cabbage.

    抓紧季节　多种秋菜
    河南确定扩大秋菜生产计划
    天津安排秋菜种植储藏工作
    据新华社郑州29日电　河南省秋菜播种面积将达到六百六十一万多亩，比去年秋菜面积增加16％，全省平均每人一分三厘多菜地。
    河南省人民委员会最近召开了全省蔬菜生产供应会议，提出了上述秋菜生产计划。为了保证秋菜种好种足，会议要求各地除了规划出常年菜田以外，还要因地制宜地推行粮菜轮作。机关、工矿企业、部队等单位，也要利用空闲地种菜，力争蔬菜部分自给。由于蔬菜生产技术性大、费工多，要求各地广泛组织专业生产队，大量传授蔬菜生产技术，大搞菜地的工具改革运动，有条件的地方要发展机耕、机井。在肥料方面，除了已拨一千一百七十万斤化学肥料专作菜肥以外，要求各地大力积聚粪肥和土杂肥。蔬菜种子，也要求各地做到自繁、自选、自留、自用。
    会议还号召大搞群众性的蔬菜加工工作，腌制干菜、咸菜，做到旺季贮存淡季销，淡季不断，旺季不烂，常年都能均衡供应。省有关部门并已拨出一笔资金，供各地作为加工蔬菜需要的基本建设投资。
    据新华社天津29日电　中共天津市委员会和市人民委员会贯彻城市近郊农业生产以蔬菜为主的方针，正当夏季蔬菜开始大量上市的时候，又及早安排了秋菜的生产，做好秋菜的种植、储藏、运输等准备工作。
    最近，中共天津市委和市人民委员会专门召开了秋季蔬菜生产会议，决定把近郊蔬菜的播种面积扩大到二十五万亩左右，比去年的秋菜播种面积增加80％，要求近郊各人民公社和生产队在耕地面积的分配、劳动力的安排、肥料和其他物料的使用等方面，根据蔬菜生产的需要，制订出规划和具体措施。在劳力安排上，要坚决组织园田生产的专业队，并且把原来从事园田生产的有经验的社员组织到专业队里来。在肥料方面，要依靠群众开展积肥运动，千方百计开辟肥源，充分利用城市污水污泥和粪便，同时，城市机关、工厂、学校和街道要结合夏季卫生运动，大力积肥，支援郊区蔬菜生产。会议指出，为了调剂淡季旺季的蔬菜供应，保证蔬菜均衡上市，必须做好蔬菜的储藏和加工工作。各公社除了发动社员挖掘物料，搭建小窑和不用木材的土窑以外，还要采取挖坑用土埋等办法，及时储存秋菜；机关、企业、学校也要大量储存腌晒秋菜。目前，各郊区已开始行动起来。许多生产队制订确保大白菜丰收的措施。
