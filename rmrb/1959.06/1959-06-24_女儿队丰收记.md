"Comrade, stand on tiptoe and look, stand on that earthen platform, stand up higher and look, see it? All the way to the dike in the west, it's all the Daughter Team's wheat field, truly, from planting to harvest, they carried it all on their shoulders." Lei Sanniang, a middle-aged women's committee member of the Third Brigade of the Chongxing Commune in Pixian County, Sichuan, immediately put down the handful of wheat she had just cut, her face beaming with joy, when I asked her about the Daughter Team of their brigade.

Following her directions, I stood on the earthen platform and looked west. I saw a field of wheat ripe and golden-red. When the wind lifted, the dense, thick ears of wheat rolled over, layer upon layer, surging towards the dike in the west.

"Comrade, looking at this fine crop, you might think they are experienced wheat growers, right? No, if it weren't for the establishment of the commune, at least twenty of these twenty-eight girls in the Daughter Team would still be tending the stove and taking care of children at home. How could they have achieved such a prominent success?" Then Lei Sanniang talked about the Daughter Team's wheat planting process.

It all started last autumn, from that morning before the rooster even woke up. The women quietly escorted more than forty male commune members who were going up the mountain to make steel to the threshing ground. They didn't turn back until they could no longer see their backs. Each of them was like a new bride who had conceived a child, truly surprised, happy, and apprehensive. Because, no one expected the days to change so quickly. In the blink of an eye, they had escaped the burden of housework and jumped into the fields. How could they not be surprised! Of course, everyone was happy from the bottom of their hearts, some even shedding tears of joy. Yes, for so many years, housework had tied up the women's hands and feet, but today they were going to manage the crops with their own hands. However, everyone was indeed a little afraid in their hearts. No one knew whether it would be a harvest or a reduced yield in the end.

The task of sowing wheat was assigned. But the brigade's labor force was insufficient. One day, when everyone was eating dinner in the canteen, old man Xu Chengxiao and several other old men discussed their worries about not being able to complete the wheat planting task. These old men were hard of hearing and spoke loudly. The women sitting next to them were furious when they heard this: "Your eyes are really failing, can't you see that there are so many women in the brigade?" Lei Sanniang laughed as she told me this: "These unlucky old men were thoroughly criticized by the women that night." From then on, the number of women going to work increased day by day. The Daughter Team was officially established and determined to take on the heavy task of the wheat field from planting to harvest.

After the Daughter Team was established, She Yuying became the captain. This daughter of a hired peasant who lost her mother at an early age and was good at arranging things, married a poor peasant suffering from "consumption" a year before liberation and had three children. She worked in the fields during the day and sewed, mended, washed, and cooked at night, taking good care of her family of five. Today, this well-known clever woman has escaped the burden of housework and jumped out to lead production. Lei Sanniang still remembers that when they were training She Yuying before, asking her to come out as a cadre, she cried holding the lone cypress tree at the door, unable to leave her home for a moment. Since the establishment of the commune, with meals in the canteen and children sent to the nursery, her energy from her maiden days immediately returned. After becoming the captain, she immediately convened a Zhuge Liang meeting with the team members, discussing it for most of the night and formulating a wheat production increase plan. To be safe and reliable, they formulated three major measures: First, resolutely listen to the Party's words and implement the "Eight-Character Charter" according to advanced standards. Second, focus on the seventy mu of wheat, and then increase the total yield by filling waste ditches, leveling bald forest plots, and making full use of idle land to plant twenty more mu of wheat. Third, hire old man Xu Chengxiao as a technical advisor.

After the meeting dispersed in the middle of the night, they entrusted Lei Sanniang to discuss it with Xu Chengxiao. The old man was shocked when he heard that they wanted to double the total wheat yield: "I can give pointers if you don't understand anything, but I dare not be an advisor." Behind his back, he said to others: "Ask me to be an advisor? No, no, if the plan is not completed by summer, I'll be embarrassed with them!"

According to the decision of the Zhuge Liang meeting, they leveled wasteland and deep ditches early. Reclamation and deep plowing were indeed not easy farm work for girls who were going to the fields for the first time. They dug one layer after another, breaking open the clods of soil and digging another layer... In less than three days, their waists were sore, their arms were weak, and bright blisters rose on their delicate hands accustomed to needlework. Some people even broke their tiger's mouths from the hoe handles, and it burned with pain every time they dug. ... After persevering like this for half a month, calluses grew on their palms, and their strength grew from small to large. Every morning, like swallows meeting spring birds, they greeted each other earlier and earlier, singing and laughing as they ran out. They didn't even bother to comb their hair, tying their heads with scarves like little soldiers on the stage. Their small faces were smeared with ash while smoking the soil, like the Bodhisattva in the Huguo Temple at the village head. The commune cadres gave them all a thumbs up and said: "Truly amazing, a group of Mu Guiyings!" In this way, with a soaring spirit of hard work, they leveled twenty mu of waste ditches, bald forest plots, and messy graves into pieces of fertile land, and thoroughly turned over these ninety mu of land from the edge of the field to the center.

However, when the wheat seedlings had just emerged, the spring drought came. The wheat seedlings turned from green to green, and from green to yellow; many wheat fields were so dry that they cracked. The rare spring drought, coupled with the fact that the Dujiangyan irrigation system did not close the ditches and block the water before the annual repairs, made people anxious to death. One day, after dinner, She Yuying gathered Tao Xiuqiong, Hou Yushu, and several other key members around the table: "This year, this dam of wheat fields is standing on the name of our Daughter Team. If there is a reward, no one will compete with us for the credit; if there is a punishment, we cannot escape the slightest bit... We can't wait for rain anymore, we must carry water to Yejia Milling Bay!"

Yejia Milling? That's more than two li away! Carrying water to the lower bay requires climbing over such a large sloping horse ridge. Moreover, this is not carrying one or two buckets, but eighty loads per mu. Can this be done? Yes, it can. The team members gathered around She Yuying one after another, saying: "Yes, it can! If you fear the dragon, you won't get water!" That night, they rolled up their trouser legs and ran out with buckets. From that day on, they carried water buckets, chasing each other, their small faces flushed. On the tenth day, they really couldn't hold on anymore. At this moment, old man Xu Chengxiao arrived at the sloping horse ridge with two old partners. It turned out that the old men were also deeply moved by the Daughter Team's hard work.

On that stormy night, as soon as the thunder sounded, they were like soldiers hearing the sound of cannons, all putting on their clothes and going to the fields to patrol. By the light of the lightning, Lei Sanniang saw She Yuying, Hou Yushu, Xiong Guifen..., and also saw old man Xu Chengxiao stumbling and running east and west in the wind and rain. Everyone ran out for one purpose: not to let a single wheat seedling fall.

On the day I left, the Daughter Team's wheat had already been harvested and threshed. The seventy mu of wheat fields under their key management generally yielded more than five hundred jin per mu, and a few yielded more than six hundred jin per mu. The newly reclaimed wasteland had a lower yield, averaging more than four hundred jin per mu. The unit area yield of the ninety mu of wheat fields increased by more than 30%; but because they both seized high-yield fields and expanded twenty mu of cultivated land, the total yield increased by more than 70% compared to the previous year. Lei Sanniang sighed all the way as she saw me off: "Comrade, this is so simple! Seeing them, you must understand why so many men were drawn away last year to make steel, and there is still such a large harvest this summer!"

    女儿队丰收记
    王焕斗
    “同志，你踮起脚看，你站到那土台子上去，再站高点儿看，看见啦？一直抵到西边那条堰沟，全是女儿队的麦田，硬是，从种到收，一担子挑起。”四川郫县崇兴公社第三中队的上了年纪的妇女委员雷三娘，见我问起她们中队的女儿小队的事，立刻放下刚割的一把麦子，喜笑颜开地走了过来。
    遵照她的指引，我站在土台子上朝西望去，只见一片小麦熟得黄里透红，叫风一掀，密密麻麻的穗子一层比一层厚实地翻卷开来，前推后涌地涌向西头的堰沟。
    “同志，你看了这一坝好庄稼，或许以为她们是些种麦的老手吧？不，要不是公社建立，女儿队这二十八个娃娃，至少有二十个还要在家里守灶台，带娃娃，哪能做出这一番出头露脸的大事。”于是雷三娘谈起了女儿队种麦的经过。
    这一切是从去年秋天，是从那个鸡都没有醒的早晨开始的。妇女们一路悄不作声地把队上四十多个上山炼铁的男社员送到场口，直到望不见背影了才转来。她们一个个就像刚过门的新媳妇怀了娃娃一样，真是一惊二喜三怕。因为，谁也没有料到日子会演变的这样快，一眨眼，就摆脱了家务拖累，跳到田头，怎不叫人吃惊！当然，不管哪一个全都打心眼儿里高兴，有些人甚至欢喜得眼泪花子直滚。是呵，多少年代啦，家务缠住了妇女的手脚，可今天却要用自己的双手经营庄稼了。不过，每个人的心里确实也有点害怕。谁也不知道，到头来是丰收，还是减产。
    播种麦子的任务交下来了。但是全队的劳动力不够。有一天，大家在食堂里吃晚饭的时候，许成孝老头跟另外几个老头子商量，大家都担心不能完成种麦任务。这几个老头的耳朵不灵，说话声音很大，坐在旁边吃饭的妇女一听就冒火啦：“你们的眼睛真是老花了，看不见队上还有这么多的妇女？”跟我说到这里，雷三娘嗬嗬嗬嗬地笑了：“这几个背时的老头子，那天晚上叫妇女们扎扎实实地批评了一通。”从这以后，出工的妇女一天天增多。女儿队正式成立了，并且下决心包下麦田从种到收的繁重任务。
    女儿队成立之后，佘玉英当了队长。这个自幼失去母亲、善于铺排的雇农的女儿，在解放前一年嫁给了一个害“饿痨”的贫农，生了三个娃娃。她白天下田干活，夜里缝、补、洗、做，一家五口人被她照顾得舒舒服服。今天，这个有名的巧媳妇摆脱了家务拖累，跳出来领导生产了。雷三娘还记得，从前培养佘玉英，叫她出来当干部时，她抱着当门的独柏树眼泪长流，家里家外一时也离不开她呀。自从公社建立后，吃饭有了食堂，娃娃送进了托儿所，她那当姑娘时的劲头马上就来了。她当了队长之后，立刻召集队员们开了一个诸葛亮会，讨论了大半夜，订出了小麦增产的计划。为了稳妥可靠，她们订出三大措施：一、坚决听党的话，按照先进标准贯彻“八字宪法”。二、重点搞好七十亩小麦，再通过填废沟、平整秃林盘和充分利用空闲土地，多种二十亩小麦，确保总产量增加。三、聘请许成孝老头当技术顾问。
    半夜散会以后，她们就委托雷三娘去跟许成孝商量。老头子一听她们要叫小麦总产量翻半番，当场吓了一跳：“有什么不懂的我可以指点，顾问我可不敢当。”背后他跟别人说：“叫我当顾问？不行，不行，到夏天完不成计划，还不陪着她们丢人！”
    按照诸葛亮会的决定，她们提早平整荒地和深沟。开荒、深耕，这对于初次下田的细女子的确不是一件轻松的农活，挖了一层再一层，刨开土块，又挖一层……，不上三天，腰也酸了，胳臂也软了，做惯针线的细手磨起一个亮晶晶的水泡，有的人还被锄把震破了虎口，挖一锄就火辣辣的疼。……这样坚持了半月之后，手掌磨出了厚茧，力气由小变大了。每天一早，就像小燕子遇见了报春鸟，你早她更早地招呼着、唱着、笑着跑了出来。头也顾不上梳了，用帕子把脑壳扎的活像戏台上的小兵，一张张小脸儿在熏土时抹的灰溜溜的，跟村头护国寺的菩萨一样。社干部看了，全都竖起大拇指说：“真了不起，硬是一群穆桂英！”就这样，凭着一股冲天的干劲，他们把二十亩废沟、秃林盘、乱坟包平整成一块块的良田，而且使这九十亩土地从田边到田心彻底翻了个身。
    可是，等到麦苗刚出土的时候，春旱来了。一根根麦苗由青变绿、由绿转黄；不少麦田干得裂了缝。少有的春旱、加上都江堰岁修断流之前没有扎沟堵水，可把人给急死了。有一天，吃过晚饭的时候，佘玉英把陶秀琼、侯玉书等几个骨干找在桌旁：“今年，这坝麦田可是立的我们女儿队的户头。该奖，没人跟我们争功；该罚，一丝一毫也赖不脱……再不能望天等雨了，我们要到叶家碾湾子里担水！”
    叶家碾？那离这儿足有两里多路！下湾担水要爬过那么大的一个斜马坡，何况这又不是担一桶两桶，而是一亩就要浇八十挑呢。这能行吗？能行。队员们纷纷凑在佘玉英的周围，七嘴八舌地说：“能行！怕龙就取不到水！”她们当天晚上便扎起裤脚、担着水桶跑出去了。从这一天开始，她们担起水桶，你追我、我赶你，一个个的小脸儿胀的绯红。第十天，她们就真的撑持不住了。就在这个时候，许成孝老头带着两个老伙伴赶到了斜马坡。原来，老头子们也被女儿队的干劲深深感动了。
    在那暴风雨的夜里，雷声一响，她们就像战士听到了炮声，不约而同地全披上衣服到田间巡视。借着闪电的亮光，雷三娘看见过佘玉英、侯玉书、熊桂芬……，也看见许成孝老头跌跌撞撞在风雨中东走西奔，大家跑出来都是为了一个目的：不让一根麦苗倒伏。
    在我临走那天，女儿队的麦子已经收完打净了。她们重点管理的七十亩麦田一般是亩产五百多斤，少数亩产六百多斤，新开的荒地产量较低，平均亩产四百来斤，九十亩麦田的单位面积产量增产三成多；但是由于她们既抓高产田又扩大二十亩耕地，总产量却比上年净增70％以上。雷三娘一路送我一路感叹着说：“同志，这是多么不简单！见了她们，你一定明白，为什么去年抽走那么多的男子去炼钢铁，今年夏天还有这么大的丰收！”
