	The Burning of Opium at Humen
	Opium, religion, and cannons were once the three major "magic weapons" of Western imperialist aggressors. As early as 1773, the British East India Company, after monopolizing the opium sales rights in India, began to engage in opium trade with China. By the nineteenth century, the amount of opium imported into China had greatly increased, and opium addiction became rampant. Silver flowed out of the country continuously, only to be replaced by more people being poisoned. At that time, farsighted people among the ruling class, represented by Lin Zexu, saw that if this continued, it would lead to "impoverished people and exhausted wealth," and the future would be unimaginable. Therefore, they put forward the demand for banning opium. The Daoguang Emperor was moved by Lin Zexu's memorial and summoned him several times to inquire about the decision to ban opium. Finally, he decided to appoint Lin Zexu as Imperial Commissioner and Governor-General of Liangguang to go to Guangzhou to investigate and ban opium. On March 18, 1839, Lin Zexu announced a proclamation to foreign merchants in Guangzhou, expressing his determination to ban opium: "If opium is not eradicated for one day, this Minister will not return for one day, and I vow to dedicate myself to this matter to the end, and there is absolutely no reason to stop!"
	One hundred and twenty years ago today, on June 3, Lin Zexu destroyed 2,376,254 catties of confiscated opium on the beach at Humen. The opium burning work did not end until the 25th of the same month.
	The British aggressors, accustomed to piracy, seeing that the effect of opium was not working, used cannons to bombard China's gate. The corrupt feudal dynasty could not resist the aggression of Western bandits, and in 1842 was forced to sign the first unequal treaty with the British government—the Treaty of Nanjing—beautifying opium as "foreign medicine" and giving it a "rationalized" trade status. From then on, China gradually became a semi-colonial and semi-feudal society. And the poison of opium also harmed the people along with this corrupt society.
	A full one hundred and twenty years have passed. Today, opium and its master—the imperialist aggressor forces—have long been cleared from the mainland by the great Chinese people. The victorious Chinese people are building a beautiful and happy life with their own hands.

    虎门焚烟
    鸦片、宗教、大炮，曾经是西方帝国主义者的三大侵略“法宝”。早在1773年，英国的东印度公司垄断印度的鸦片专卖权以后，就开始对中国经营鸦片贸易了。到了十九世纪，鸦片输入中国的数量大大增加，鸦片烟毒就在中国泛滥起来。白银不断外流，换来的只是更多的人受到毒害。当时以林则徐为代表的统治阶级中间有远见的人们看到长此以往，会弄得“民穷财尽”，前途不堪设想。于是提出了禁烟的要求。道光皇帝被林则徐的奏折所感动，曾经数度召见，询问禁烟决策。最后决定，任命林则徐为钦差大臣兼两广总督，赴广州查禁鸦片。1839年3月18日，林则徐在广州向洋商们宣布谕帖，表示禁烟的决心：“若鸦片一日未绝，本大臣一日不回，誓与此事相终始，断无中止之理！”
    一百二十年前的今天，6月3日，林则徐把收缴的鸦片二百三十七万六千二百五十四斤，在虎门滩上销毁。焚烟工作一直到同月25日才告结束。
    惯于海盗行为的英国侵略者见鸦片效用不灵，就用大炮轰击中国的大门，腐朽的封建王朝抵挡不住西方强盗的侵略，1842年被迫与英国政府签订第一个不平等条约——南京条约，把鸦片美其名曰“洋药”，予以贸易的“合理化”。从此以后，中国一步一步地变成半殖民地半封建社会。而鸦片的毒害也随着这腐朽的社会戕害着人民。
    整整一百二十年过去了，今天，鸦片烟和它的主子——帝国主义侵略势力早已被伟大的中国人民从大陆上清除出去了。胜利了的中国人民，正用自己的双手建设美好的、幸福的生活。
