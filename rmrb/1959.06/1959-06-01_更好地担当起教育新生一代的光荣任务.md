    Today is International Children's Day, June 1st. Let me extend warm congratulations to the children of the whole country, and also extend cordial greetings to the educators, primary school teachers, junior high school teachers, counselors, and children's education workers across the country.

    Children are the successors to the construction of socialism and communism. China's socialist system has created unprecedentedly favorable conditions for the growth of children. The Party has always given the utmost care to the cause of cultivating and educating the new generation. Chairman Mao taught children to "study hard" and "make progress every day," and at the same time, he clearly instructed us that the new generation that the Party and the country want to cultivate are "laborers with socialist consciousness and culture." This embodies the expectations of the Party and the country for the new generation, and also entrusts all comrades engaged in children's education with a glorious task.

    We are pleased to see that the new generation is growing up healthily. In 1958, preschool education experienced unprecedented development, and primary school education was basically universalized in many places. Under the guidance of the Party's education policy, the moral, intellectual, and physical development of the vast number of children has been comprehensively developed. We can clearly see their intellectual development, increased knowledge, enhanced physical fitness, and tremendous changes in their mental outlook. Our schools have included labor as a formal course. Many schools have set up small factories and small farms. Primary school students all participate in certain light labor. The National Young Pioneers also enthusiastically launched three activities: planting trees and making forests, eliminating the four pests and paying attention to hygiene, and speaking Mandarin. During the national steelmaking campaign, children collected scrap iron, panned iron sand, and looked for refractory materials; during the summer and autumn harvests, the Young Pioneers organized children to help pick up grain, striving for "every grain to return to the granary"; they also actively participated in the manure accumulation campaign. The children proudly said: "The Young Pioneers have a share in the national Great Leap Forward." In labor practice, children have increased a lot of knowledge, and more importantly, they have received vivid communist ideological and political education, have developed a love for labor, and have cultivated labor habits. At the same time, due to the strengthening of ideological and political education, their patriotism, collectivism, and spirit of consciously abiding by discipline have also increased significantly. They responded to the Party's call and worked hard to study. While studying their lessons well, they also organized various science and technology group activities and carried out extracurricular reading activities. In this way, they have further enriched their knowledge, and some children have been able to create and invent. The above achievements are inseparable from the leadership of the Party, the efforts of all teachers, counselors, and children's education workers, and the support and help of the entire society.

    The new situation puts forward higher demands on all of us children's education workers. We must do our best to accept the entrustment of the Party and the country and better undertake the task of cultivating and educating the new generation.

    To cultivate and educate the new generation well, we must further implement the Party's education policy and educate children in the spirit of communism. To achieve this goal, we must strengthen the cultural and knowledge education of children, organize them to participate in appropriate labor, and improve and strengthen their ideological and political education. All of this must pay attention to the characteristics of education work, adapt to the age characteristics of children, and master the laws of physical and mental development of children. Only in this way can we achieve real results.

    Currently, teachers should pay special attention to conscientiously improving teaching and improving the quality of education. To this end, teachers must strive to improve teaching methods and conscientiously prepare lessons and correct homework. In the primary school stage, special emphasis should be placed on enabling students to learn Chinese and arithmetic well. Laying a solid foundation in these two subjects will be of great benefit to students' future study and labor. In teaching, teachers should be good at using heuristic teaching methods to give play to students' initiative and enthusiasm in learning. The cramming method should be resolutely abolished. Teaching work is a very meticulous work and should adhere to the principle of gradual progress. If you are too impatient, you will inevitably fail to achieve your goals. Past and present experiences have proved that transplanting the methods of short-term assaults and appraisal competitions in production movements to learning will not only fail to improve the quality of teaching, but on the contrary, it will often reduce the quality. We must take this as a warning.

    Taking productive labor as a formal course in our schools is a major revolution in school education, and it is of decisive significance for cultivating well-rounded new people. All schools should, in accordance with the spirit of the State Council's "Regulations on the Arrangement of Teaching, Labor, and Life in Full-time Schools," and in conjunction with the specific conditions of the locality, properly arrange children's labor. Organizing children to participate in labor must strictly pay attention to their age and physical strength, and they can only participate in some relatively simple and light labor. The labor time should not be too long, and they must not be asked to participate in labor that they cannot bear. Only in this way is it beneficial to promote their physical and mental development. Where conditions permit, the small factories and small farms within the school should be effectively run as basic places for primary school students to participate in labor. Social public welfare labor can be appropriately participated in by children, but it should not be too much.

    To educate the new generation in the spirit of communism, this requires us to improve and strengthen the ideological and political education work of children. We must always remember an important lesson from the past, and we must not separate children from social life and carry out education behind closed doors. We know that flowers and plants grown in greenhouses cannot withstand wind and sun. Therefore, to educate children in the spirit of communism, we must be good at combining the actual social life to educate them, let them participate in certain social political movements and productive labor, so that they can be tempered and edified in real life.

    Educating children not only in content, but also in methods and methods must be suitable for the age characteristics of children, and we must not arbitrarily apply methods for educating adults. A basic method for carrying out ideological and political education for children is to patiently persuade and educate them. For all the positive factors of children, even those that are budding, we should pay great attention to and cherish, and pay attention to consolidating and carrying forward. For their advantages, we should give timely and appropriate encouragement and praise; for their shortcomings, we should also point them out in time, and at the same time patiently persuade them to correct them.

    It should be pointed out that many teachers and counselors understand the above-mentioned principles and truths and implement these principles and truths in their work. It is precisely because of this that the work of educating children has achieved many results. This is one aspect, and it is the main aspect. But on the other hand, there are still a few comrades who do not really understand these principles and truths, and therefore cannot master appropriate educational methods. Although they have good intentions and full enthusiasm for education work, they use wrong and inappropriate education methods. In their actual work, they often ignore the age characteristics of children and inappropriately apply adult education methods and rectification movement methods; individual comrades even ignore the characteristics and laws of ideological work and education work, and adopt some methods of engaging in production movements and some simple organizational measures, such as stipulating inappropriate indicators, putting forward many inappropriate slogans, and engaging in too many collective activities, and so on. Obviously, doing so will not achieve positive results. Education work is a complex ideological work, and must be carried out in depth, meticulously, and patiently in accordance with the age characteristics of children and their different personality characteristics, and correct and appropriate methods must be adopted. "All success cannot be achieved in one battle." As the saying goes in our ancient language, "It takes ten years to grow trees, but a hundred years to cultivate people." It can be seen that any simple and impetuous practice that ignores the laws of education work is inappropriate. This should be effectively improved in the future.

    The Young Pioneers play a great role in ideological education for children. We hope that the Young Pioneers will better contact and cooperate with schools and teachers in the future, further strengthen ideological work and organizational work, and play a greater role in the work of cultivating and educating the new generation.

    Parents have an important responsibility for the education of their children that cannot be shirked. With the development of society, the role of social education on the new generation will become greater and greater, which is inevitable; but this does not mean that family education can be weakened in any way. Parents should not only love their children, but more importantly, they should be good at educating their children correctly. Children should not be pampered; nor should they be beaten and scolded instead of education, and relying solely on strictness to gain prestige. The former is not loving children, but harming children; the latter is a fundamentally wrong method that cannot solve the problem. From the perspective of kindergartens and schools, they should establish regular contact with parents, and through parent meetings, home visits, and other methods, make family education and school education closely integrated.

    Whenever we see the lively and lovely new generation, our hearts are filled with joy and hope. But at the same time, we feel a serious sense of responsibility spurring us on. We must redouble our efforts and not slack off. All comrades engaged in children's education work should further improve their ideological awareness, strengthen their sense of responsibility and honor in their work, and devote all their energy and enthusiasm to caring for children, loving children, and educating children. At the same time, they should also continue to improve their political, professional, and cultural levels, so as to better educate children and make their growth in line with the expectations and requirements of the Party and the country. To further promote it, cultivating and educating the new generation is the task of the whole people and requires the common undertaking of the entire society. Therefore, it is still necessary to further strengthen the social atmosphere of caring for the growth of the new generation. 1959 is the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China and also the tenth anniversary of the founding of the Young Pioneers. This year's commemoration of the "June 1st" Children's Day has a greater and more far-reaching significance. We believe that under the cordial care and correct leadership of the Party, the lofty cause of cultivating and educating the new generation in our country will surely achieve greater success in the future.

    更好地担当起教育新生一代的光荣任务
    杨秀峰
    今天是“六一”国际儿童节，让我向全国的少年儿童致以热烈的祝贺，同时也向全国的教养员、小学教师、初中教师、辅导员和少年儿童教育工作者致以亲切的问候。
    少年儿童是建设社会主义和共产主义的接班人。我国的社会主义制度为少年儿童的成长创造了空前优越的条件。党对于培养和教育新生一代的事业一向给予最大的关怀。毛主席教导少年儿童“好好学习”，“天天向上”，同时还明确地指示我们，党和国家所要培养的新生一代是“有社会主义觉悟的、有文化的劳动者”。这体现了党和国家对新生一代的期望，也赋予了我们从事少年儿童教育工作的全体同志以光荣的任务。
    我们高兴地看到，新生一代正在茁壮地成长起来。1958年，幼儿教育有着空前的发展，小学教育在许多地方基本上普及了。在党的教育方针的指导下，广大少年儿童的德育、智育、体育得到了全面的发展。我们清楚地看到他们智力的发展，知识的增长，体质的增强和精神面貌的巨大变化。我们的学校已经把劳动列为正式课程。许多学校办了小工厂、小农场。小学学生都参加了一定的轻微劳动。全国少年先锋队还热烈展开了植树造林、除四害讲卫生、讲普通话这三项活动。在全民炼钢运动中，少年儿童拾废铁，淘铁沙，找耐火材料；在夏收、秋收中，少年先锋队组织孩子们帮助拣粮，力争“颗粒归仓”；他们还积极参加积肥运动。孩子们自豪地说：“全国大跃进，红领巾有一份”。在劳动实践中，少年儿童增长了不少知识，更重要的是受到了生动的共产主义的思想政治教育，具有了热爱劳动的思想感情，养成了劳动习惯。同时，又由于思想政治教育的加强，他们的爱国主义、集体主义和自觉遵守纪律的精神也有了显著的增长。他们响应了党的号召，努力学习。在学好功课的同时，他们还在课外组织了各种科学技术的小组活动，开展了课外阅读活动。这样，他们进一步丰富了知识，有些少年儿童因而能有所创造和发明。以上这些成绩的取得，是和党的领导，全体教师、辅导员和少年儿童教育工作者的努力，以及整个社会的支持和帮助分不开的。
    新的形势对我们全体少年儿童教育工作者提出了更高的要求。我们必须尽最大的努力，接受党和国家的嘱托，把培养和教育新生一代的任务更好地担当起来。
    要培养和教育好新生一代，必须进一步贯彻执行党的教育方针，以共产主义的精神教育少年儿童。为达到这个目的，就要加强对少年儿童的文化知识教育，组织他们参加适当的劳动，改进和加强对他们的思想政治教育。所有这一切，都要注意从教育工作的特点出发，要适应少年儿童的年龄特点，掌握少年儿童身心发展的规律。只有这样，才能收到真正的效果。
    当前，教师们应当特别注意的是认真改进教学，提高教育质量。为此，教师就要努力改进教法，并认真备课和批改作业。在小学阶段，要特别着重使学生学好语文、算术。扎扎实实把这两门功课的基础打好，这对学生将来学习和劳动都有极大的好处。在教学中，教师要善于用启发式的教法，发挥学生学习的自觉性和积极性，填鸭式的教法应当坚决废除。教学工作是一项很细致的工作，应当坚持循序渐进的原则。如果操之过急，必然是欲速不达。过去和现在的经验都证明：把生产运动中的短期突击、评比竞赛的办法，硬搬到学习方面来，结果不但提不高教学质量，相反地往往是降低了质量。这一点，我们必须引以为戒。
    把生产劳动作为我们学校的一门正式课程，这是学校教育的一大革命，它对于培养全面发展的新人具有决定性的意义。各学校都应当按照国务院“关于全日制学校的教学、劳动、生活安排的规定”的精神，结合当地的具体情况，妥善地安排少年儿童的劳动。组织少年儿童参加劳动，必须严格注意适合他们的年龄和体力，只能让他们参加一些比较简单的、轻微的劳动，劳动时间也不宜过长，决不可叫他们参加力不能胜的劳动。只有这样，才有益于促进他们的身心发育。有条件的地方，应当把校内的小工厂、小农场切实办好，作为小学生参加劳动的基本场所。社会公益劳动，可以让少年儿童适当地参加一些，但是不宜过多。
    要以共产主义的精神教育新生一代，这就要求我们改进和加强对少年儿童的思想政治教育工作。要时刻记住过去的一条重要经验，对少年儿童不能脱离社会生活，关起门来进行教育。我们知道，温室中生长起来的花草是经不起风吹日晒的。因此，以共产主义精神教育少年儿童，要善于结合社会生活实际来教育他们，让他们参加一定的社会政治运动和生产劳动，使他们在现实生活中受到锻炼，得到陶冶。
    对少年儿童进行教育，不仅在内容上，就是在方式、方法上也必须适合少年儿童的年龄特点，决不可随便搬用教育成人的办法。对少年儿童进行思想政治教育的一条基本办法，就是循循善诱，说服教育，对于少年儿童的一切积极因素，哪怕是正在萌芽状态的，都应当十分重视和爱护，并且注意巩固和发扬，对于他们的优点，应当及时地适当地给以鼓励和表扬；对于他们的缺点，也要及时指出，同时又耐心地说服他们改正。
    应当指出，很多教师和辅导员同志是懂得上面所说的这些原则和道理的，并且把这些原则和道理贯彻在工作里的。正因为这样，教育少年儿童的工作才取得了很多成绩。这是一方面，而且是主要的一方面。但是另一方面，也还有少数同志并没有真正了解这些原则和道理，因而就不能掌握适当的教育方法。他们对教育工作虽然有良好的意愿和充分的热情，但是使用了错误的、不适当的教育方法。他们在实际工作中常常忽视少年儿童的年龄特点，不恰当地搬用成人教育的办法，搬用整风运动的办法；个别同志甚至忽视思想工作、教育工作的特点和规律，采用一些搞生产运动的方法，采用一些简单的组织措施，如规定不适当的指标，提出许多不适当的口号，过多地搞集体活动，等等。显然，这样做是收不到积极效果的。教育工作是一种复杂的思想工作，必须按照少年儿童的年龄特点和他们不同的性格特点，采取正确的适当的方法，深入地、细致地、耐心地来进行，决不能“毕其功于一役”。我国古语说得好，
  “十年树木，百年树人”。可见任何忽视教育工作规律的简单、急躁的做法都是不妥当的。对此，今后应当切实改进。
    对少年儿童进行思想教育工作，少年先锋队起着很大的作用。我们希望少年先锋队今后要和学校、教师更好地联系配合，进一步加强思想工作和组织工作，在培养和教育新生一代的工作中发挥更大的作用。
    家长对于子女的教育有着不容推卸的重要责任，随着社会的发展，社会教育对新生一代的作用将越来越大，这是必然的；但是这并不意味着家庭教育可以有任何削弱。家长不仅要爱护子女，尤其重要的，要善于正确地教育子女。对子女不应当溺爱；也不应当以打骂代替教育，单靠严厉来取得威信。前者不是爱孩子，而是害孩子；后者则是根本不能解决问题的错误方法。从幼儿园和学校方面来说，应当和家长建立经常的联系，通过家长会议、家庭访问等方式，使家庭教育和学校教育密切地结合起来。
    每当看到活泼可爱的新生一代的时候，我们内心充满着欢乐和希望。但是同时又感到严重的责任感在鞭策我们，我们要加倍振奋，不能懈怠。全体从事少年儿童教育工作的同志应当进一步提高自己的思想觉悟，加强工作的责任感和光荣感，拿出自己的全部精力和热情来关怀少年儿童，热爱少年儿童，教育少年儿童。同时，还应当不断提高自己的政治、业务和文化水平，以便把少年儿童教育得更好，使他们的成长符合党和国家的期望和要求。再推广开来说，培养和教育新生一代是全民的任务，还需要整个社会共同来担当。因此，关心新生一代成长的社会风气，还有必要进一步加强。1959年是我国国庆十周年，也是少年先锋队建队十周年。今年纪念“六一”儿童节，有着更重大和更深远的意义。我们相信在党的亲切关怀和正确领导下，我国培养和教育新生一代的崇高事业，今后一定会取得更大的成就。
