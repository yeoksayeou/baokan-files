The unit area yield of 3,354 mu of dryland sweet potatoes increased by 81.5% compared to last year.

Since the second half of last year, Chaoyang County has consistently used methods such as open discussions and debates, presenting facts, and calculating detailed accounts to repeatedly illustrate the important position of sweet potatoes in grain production, enabling the masses to recognize the economic value of sweet potatoes. The masses have been working hard and have set off a large-scale, high-yield sweet potato campaign. They have promoted methods such as reasonable close planting and crop rotation based on local conditions, and have strengthened management work such as fertilization, drainage, irrigation, and weeding, thus achieving a bumper harvest.

    潮阳县越冬甘薯产量高
    十四万亩亩产四千五百多斤
    据新华社广州电　广东省汕头专区潮阳县去年秋季种植的十八万多亩越冬甘薯，现在已经收获了十四万五千三百一十亩，平均亩产量达到四千五百二十五斤，比去年增加44％。其中有九千一百二十五亩亩产量超过八千斤。甘薯高产区海门公社的一千五百三十七亩水田薯，平均每亩产量由去年的五千四百零三斤增加到七千九百二十斤；三千三百五十四亩旱园薯的单位面积产量，比去年增加了81.5％。向来是低产区的仙庵公社百坑大队，现在已收获的六百六十多亩甘薯，平均每亩产量也达到三千七百五十多斤，比去年增产了50％以上。
    潮阳县从去年下半年以来，各地经常运用鸣放辩论、摆事实、算细账的方法，反复说明甘薯在粮食生产中所占的重要地位，使群众认识甘薯的经济价值。各地群众鼓足干劲，掀起了甘薯大面积高产运动。他们因地制宜地推广了合理密植和轮作等方法，加强了施肥、排灌、中耕除草等管理工作，因而取得了大丰收。
