Semi-Monthly International Review
(June 1 to June 15)

    The Geneva Conference Enters a Decisive Stage

The current situation of the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference between East and West has aroused close attention and serious anxiety from public opinion in various countries. Due to the Western countries' efforts to persist in the occupation system of West Berlin and their refusal of the new proposals recently put forward by the Soviet Union regarding the issue of West Berlin and the All-German Committee, the conference has reached a serious deadlock.

In the past half-month or so, the Geneva Conference has been focusing on the Berlin issue. On this issue, as with the issue of concluding a peace treaty with Germany discussed a few days ago, it clearly demonstrated the two different positions, viewpoints, and attitudes of the representatives of Eastern and Western countries.

At the end of May, the Western countries put forward a so-called seven-point plan for "unifying" Berlin. This plan not only insisted on the Western countries' occupation rights in West Berlin but even arrogantly attempted to expand this outdated and illegal "right" to East Berlin, separating East Berlin from the German Democratic Republic. After this absurd plan was sternly refuted and rejected by the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic, the Western countries put forward a five-point proposal, still insisting on allowing their troops to stay in West Berlin indefinitely. Although they also expressed their willingness to stipulate a "maximum limit" for the troops stationed in West Berlin, the so-called "maximum limit" would be no less than the existing number. They also had to admit that the subversive and destructive activities of West Berlin against the German Democratic Republic and the socialist camp were too rampant, and therefore expressed their willingness to restrain them slightly, but they took the opportunity to slander and smear the German Democratic Republic shamelessly.

The Soviet and German Democratic Republic representatives reiterated at the meeting their proposal to end the occupation regime in West Berlin and make West Berlin a demilitarized free city. The Soviet Union first proposed that the four major powers sign a special document to ensure that West Berlin becomes a demilitarized free city. The city would not participate in any military alliances or agreements and would prohibit any hostile activities against other countries. Later, the Soviet Union put forward a new proposal, advocating this to replace the Western countries' five-point proposal. The Soviet proposal pointed out three ways to solve the Berlin problem: 1. The Western occupying forces completely withdraw from West Berlin; 2. The four countries, including the Soviet Union, can station some symbolic troops in West Berlin; 3. Neutral countries send some symbolic number of troops to replace the Western troops. Anyone can see that the Soviet proposals took into account both the necessity of solving the Berlin problem and some of the other party's demands. If this is used as the basis for an agreement, the Berlin problem can be reasonably resolved, thereby helping to eliminate the tension within Germany and throughout Europe.

However, the Western countries not only refused to end the occupation of West Berlin but also demanded that the Soviet Union issue a written guarantee to legalize their "right" to occupy West Berlin permanently. When this arrogant demand was rebuffed, they put pressure on the Soviet Union, spreading the word that if the Soviet Union did not make concessions on the Berlin issue, they would not be prepared to hold a summit meeting. US President Eisenhower also personally came forward on June 3, saying that the Geneva Conference had not made enough progress for the West to agree to hold a summit meeting.

This kind of tactics by the Western countries certainly cannot play any role against the Soviet Union. Comrade Khrushchev clearly pointed out that the Soviet Union would not agree to sign an agreement that would perpetuate the occupation system in West Berlin under any pressure. However, in order to break the deadlock in the conference and promote its progress, the Soviet Union continued to make efforts. At the meeting on June 10, the Soviet Union put forward another major proposal. Taking into account the position of the Western countries, the Soviet Union was prepared not to insist on the immediate and complete abolition of the occupation system in West Berlin, but to agree that the Western countries could retain certain occupation rights. However, these rights can only be maintained for one year. During this period, the Western countries should reduce the number of troops stationed in West Berlin, stop subversive and destructive activities, and prohibit the deployment of atomic and rocket weapons. At the same time, within this year, the two Germanys should establish an All-German Committee on an equal footing. Its task is to promote contacts between East and West Germany, discuss and formulate concrete measures for a unified Germany, and study issues related to the preparation and conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany.

This proposal once again embodied the sincerity of the Soviet Union in seeking a basis for agreement by bringing the attitudes of both sides closer, but the Western countries, led by the United States, rejected it outright without carefully studying it. They even arrogantly demanded that the Soviet Union withdraw the proposal and threatened to interrupt the conference. It is clear to everyone that their behavior can only show that they do not want the conference to reach any agreement.

The Foreign Ministers' Conference is now facing a decisive stage. The key to the outcome lies entirely with the Western countries, led by the United States.

        Laos Situation Continues to Deteriorate

In the past half-month, the situation in Laos has continued to deteriorate. Because the Lao Kingdom government, under the instigation of the United States, tore up the Geneva Accords and brazenly launched armed attacks on the Lao Fighting Units, the peace of Laos has been disrupted. Under these circumstances, the Second Battalion of the Lao Fighting Units was forced to carry out self-defense battles. According to the "Xieng Khouang Lao Patriots News," since mid-May, this unit of the Lao people, after twenty days of heroic fighting, smashed the encirclement, attack, and pursuit of the Lao Kingdom government army, which was equipped with American weapons, and successfully transferred from its original station to the strategic Xieng Khouang mountainous area, and is now continuing its heroic struggle.

The Xieng Khouang mountainous area is the old base area where the Lao Fighting Units fought the anti-French war in the past. According to newspaper reports, the people in the Xieng Khouang mountainous area and the areas bordering Vietnam and Laos expressed their indignation at the Pe Sananikone government of Laos for launching a civil war and disrupting the normal lives of the people. Wherever the Kingdom army went, most of the people implemented a scorched earth policy. The Second Battalion of the Lao Fighting Units was supported and supported by the people in the駐地.

The public in various countries has expressed legitimate concern about the serious situation in which the peace of Laos has been undermined. In particular, the countries and people related to the Geneva Accords cannot ignore this. The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Chinese Government have repeatedly called for an end to the Lao Kingdom Government's actions of abandoning the Geneva Accords and for the restoration of the activities of the International Supervisory and Control Commission in Laos to save the peace of Laos. As one of the chairmen of the Geneva Conference on Indochina, the Soviet Government, on May 30, sent a note to the British Government, another chairman of the Geneva Conference, on the situation in Laos, advocating the resumption of the work of the Lao International Commission and emphasizing that the Lao Kingdom Government's actions of violating international agreements seriously threatened the peace of Indochina. Subsequently, Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko held talks with British Foreign Secretary Lloyd in Geneva on the Laos issue. In addition, the Polish and Indian governments, as members of the Lao International Commission, also requested that effective measures be taken in accordance with the Geneva Accords to resolve the Laos issue.

However, the British Government abandoned its solemn responsibility to maintain the Geneva Accords, rejected the Soviet proposal to restore the actual work of the Lao International Commission, and defended the Lao Kingdom Government's actions to undermine the Geneva Accords, and exonerated the United States from its crimes of interfering in Lao affairs and instigating the Lao civil war.

At present, the aggressive forces headed by US imperialism are trying to further intensify the tense situation in Laos and Indochina and are conspiring to expand the war in Laos. United Press International openly clamored in a telegram from Washington on June 5 that if the situation in Laos "escalates into an international crisis," the "Southeast Asia Treaty Organization may directly intervene." The Secretary-General of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, Nai Pote Sarasin of Thailand, also clamored on June 9 that the Southeast Asian aggressive bloc cannot "sit idly by" in Laos, and if the Lao authorities request "assistance," the Southeast Asian bloc will be "willing to consider." Saigon also did not want to be left out. The "Vietnam Times" on June 14 came out and shouted loudly, calling on the so-called "free countries and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization" to take a "firm stand" on Laos. This burst of violent clamor by US imperialism and its lackeys nakedly exposed the conspiracy of the Washington aggressive bloc to use the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization to interfere in the situation in Laos. The peace-loving countries and people in Asia and the world cannot but pay close attention to the serious situation of the US aggressive forces' conspiracy to undermine the peace in Indochina.

        New Storm in Latin America

America's "backyard" has been swept by new storms in the past half-month: the Cuban people have launched another struggle against US interference in internal affairs over the issue of land reform; armed struggle has broken out in Nicaragua against the US puppet Somoza dictatorship.

The implementation of land reform in Cuba is of great significance for eradicating the feudal estate system in Cuba and getting rid of the economic shackles of American monopoly capital. It is an important part of the Cuban national democratic revolutionary movement. Precisely for this reason, the United States is determined to undermine Cuba's land reform. Before the Cuban government officially implemented land reform, American reactionary newspapers spread a large number of arguments that "land reform is not conducive to the Cuban economy," threatening that another "Guatemala incident" would occur, and American officials more than once threatened to greatly reduce the US quota for purchasing Cuban sugar. After Cuba officially announced and began to implement the Land Reform Law on June 4, the destructive activities of the United States entered a more rampant stage. On the one hand, American monopoly organizations colluded with the big plantation owners in Cuba to launch a large-scale movement against the Land Reform Law, instigating small owners to hold demonstrations; on the other hand, they carried out various conspiracies, such as creating artificial economic chaos in Cuba, instigating Batista elements to carry out counter-revolutionary activities, and so on. On June 11, the US government officially sent a note to the Cuban government, openly interfering in Cuba's internal affairs, and unreasonably demanding that Cuba "further exchange views" with the United States on the issue of land reform.

The shameless acts of interference by the American imperialists have been strongly countered by the Cuban people and government. Prime Minister Castro solemnly declared that the Cuban people have mastered their own destiny and do not need to consider the opinions of others when formulating laws. He also announced that criminal sanctions would be imposed on landlords who resisted land reform. At present, people in various parts of Cuba have taken action to protest the American imperialists' shameless interference in Cuba's internal affairs. The Cuban people, who once severely struck the American imperialists' interference activities in the issue of punishing Batista criminals with united actions, will certainly continue to maintain unity and give the American interferers a new blow in the issue of land reform.

While interfering in Cuba's internal affairs, the American imperialists are also busy interfering in Nicaragua's internal affairs, trying to save the collapsing Somoza dictatorship. Since the armed forces led by Nicaraguan political exiles entered Nicaragua on May 31 and June 1, even though Somoza mobilized superior forces, they still could not stop the advance of the anti-government army. This armed uprising has rapidly developed into a national movement to overthrow tyranny. Various parties and some political exile organizations in Nicaragua that oppose the Somoza dictatorship have jointly formed the "Nicaraguan Revolutionary Alliance," calling for the overthrow of tyranny and the reform of the country. Residents in various places have joined the ranks of the anti-government army, and Somoza's bloody suppression can only arouse more Nicaraguan people to join the struggle against dictatorship.

The storm that has swept Nicaragua has made the American imperialists' hands and feet even busier. The United States held a special meeting of the "Organization of American States" in Washington on June 3 and 4, and at the same time instructed the ministers of the interior of the six Central American countries to hold a meeting in Guatemala on June 4 and 5. The situation of these meetings shows that the United States is attempting to interfere in the armed struggle that broke out in Nicaragua under the guise of "preventing communist infiltration into the Central American region." At present, the United States is actively deploying its conspiracy of intervention. However, the movement of the people of Latin American countries against US interference in Nicaragua's internal affairs is also unfolding vigorously. The Nicaraguan people's anti-dictatorship struggle is not isolated. They have the support of the people of Latin America and the sympathy of the world. Inspired by the glorious example of the Cuban people overthrowing the Batista dictatorship, the Nicaraguan people will gain new victories.

    半月国际述评
    （6月1日至6月15日）
    日内瓦会议进入决定性阶段
    日内瓦东西方外长会议的目前情况，已引起了各国舆论的密切注意和严重不安。由于西方国家千方百计地企图坚持西柏林的占领制度，和拒绝苏联最近提出的关于西柏林和全德委员会问题的新建议，会议已出现了严重的僵局。
    最近半个多月来，日内瓦会议一直在集中讨论柏林问题。在这个问题上，也同前些日子讨论关于缔结对德和约问题一样，清楚地表现了东西方国家代表的两种不同的立场、观点和态度。
    西方国家在5月底曾经提出了一个所谓“统一”柏林的七点计划，这个计划不但要坚持西方国家在西柏林的占领权利，甚至还狂妄地企图把这种早已过时和非法的“权利”扩大到东柏林去，把东柏林从德意志民主共和国分割开来。在这个荒谬的计划遭到苏联和德意志民主共和国的严正驳斥和拒绝以后，西方国家又提出了一个五点建议，仍然坚持要让他们的军队无限期地赖在西柏林不走。虽然他们也表示要对西柏林的驻军规定一个“最高限额”，但所谓“最高限额”也者，就是不少于现有的人数。他们也不得不承认西柏林针对德意志民主共和国和社会主义阵营的颠复破坏活动太猖狂了，因而表示准备稍加节制，但他们又乘机对德意志民主共和国进行无耻的诽谤和诬蔑。
    苏联和德意志民主共和国代表在会上重申了结束西柏林占领制度和使西柏林成为非军事化自由城市的主张。苏联首先提出建议，主张由四大国签署专门文件，来保证西柏林成为非军事化的自由城市。这个城市将不参加任何军事性的联盟和协定，并禁止任何反对其他国家的敌对活动。后来，苏联又提出了一个新的建议，主张以此来代替西方国家的五点建议。苏联的建议指出了解决柏林问题的三种办法：一、西方的占领军队完全撤出西柏林；二、包括苏联在内的四国可以在西柏林驻扎一些象征性的军队；三、由中立国家派驻一些象征性数量的军队来代替西方军队。谁都可以看出，苏联的这些建议，既考虑到解决柏林问题的必要性，也考虑到对方的某些要求。如果以此作为协议基础，就可以使柏林问题得到合理的解决，从而有助于消除德国内部和整个欧洲的紧张局势。
    但是西方国家不但不愿结束西柏林的占领地位，反倒要求苏联出具书面保证，使他们永久占领西柏林的“权利”合法化。当他们这种狂妄要求碰壁以后，就向苏联施加压力，放出空气说，如果苏联不在柏林问题上让步，就不准备召开最高级会议。美国总统艾森豪威尔也在6月3日亲自出马，说什么日内瓦会议还没有取得足以使西方同意召开最高级会议的进展。
    西方国家的这种手段对苏联当然是起不了什么作用的。赫鲁晓夫同志明确地指出：苏联不论在怎样的压力下也不会同意签订使西柏林占领制度永久化的协定。但为了打开会议的僵局，促使会议的进展，苏联仍然继续作出努力。在6月10日会议上，苏联又提出了一个重大的建议。考虑到西方国家的立场，苏联准备不坚持立即完全取消西柏林的占领制度，而同意西方国家可以保留某些占领权利。但这些权利只能保持一年。在此期间，西方国家应在西柏林减少驻军人数，停止颠复破坏活动，并禁止设置原子和火箭武器。同时，在这一年内，两个德国应该在平等的基础上建立全德委员会。它的任务是促进东西德之间的接触，讨论并拟订统一的德国的具体措施，以及研究同准备和缔结对德和约有关的问题。
    这个建议再一次体现了苏联为使双方态度接近以寻求协议基础的诚意，但是以美国为首的西方国家还没有对这个建议进行仔细研究就横加拒绝，他们甚至狂妄地要求苏联收回这个建议，并以中断会议相威胁。谁都看得清楚，他们的这种行为只能说明他们并不想使会议达成什么协议。
    目前外长会议已面临决定性的阶段。究竟结果如何，关键完全在于以美国为首的西方国家。
        老挝局势继续恶化
    这半月之内，老挝局势继续恶化。由于老挝王国政府在美国唆使下，撕毁日内瓦协议，悍然对寮国战斗部队发动武装进攻，使老挝的和平受到了破坏。在这种情况下，寮国战斗部队第二营被迫进行了自卫战斗。据“川圹老挝爱国者消息报”报道，从5月中旬开始，这一支老挝人民的子弟部队经过二十天的英勇战斗之后，粉碎了以美国武器装备起来的老挝王国政府军队的包围、进攻和追击，并胜利地从原驻地转移到险要的川圹山岭地带，现正继续进行着英勇的斗争。
    川圹山区是寮国战斗部队过去进行反法战争的老根据地。据报纸报道，川圹山区和越、老边界地带的人民，对老挝培·萨纳尼空政府发动内战，破坏人民正常生活的行为表示愤慨。王国军队所到之处，大部分百姓都实行了坚壁清野。寮国战斗部队第二营则受到驻地人民的拥护和支持。
    对于老挝和平遭受破坏的严重形势，各国公众表示了正当的关切。特别是与日内瓦协议有关的国家和人民，对此更不能置之不顾。越南民主共和国和中国政府曾一再呼吁制止老挝王国政府背弃日内瓦协议的行为，并恢复老挝国际监察和监督委员会的活动，以拯救老挝的和平。作为有关印度支那问题的日内瓦会议主席之一，苏联政府在5月30日就老挝局势照会日内瓦会议的另一个主席英国政府，主张恢复老挝国际委员会的工作，并强调指出，老挝王国政府的破坏国际协议的行为严重地威胁到印度支那的和平。接着，苏联外长葛罗米柯就老挝问题在日内瓦与英国外交大臣劳埃德进行会谈。此外，作为老挝国际委员会成员的波兰和印度政府也要求按照日内瓦协议，采取有效的措施以解决老挝问题。
    但是，英国政府竟放弃自己维护日内瓦协议的庄严的职责，拒绝了苏联关于恢复老挝国际委员会实际工作的建议，并且为老挝王国政府破坏日内瓦协议的行径进行辩解，还为美国开脱其干涉老挝事务、煽动老挝内战的罪责。
    目前以美帝国主义为首的侵略势力正力图进一步加剧老挝和印度支那的紧张局势，阴谋扩大老挝的战火。合众国际社在6月5日发自华盛顿的电讯中公然叫嚷老挝局势如果“扩大成国际危机”，“东南亚条约组织可能直接干预。”东南亚条约组织的秘书长、泰国的乃朴·沙拉信也在6月9日叫嚷东南亚侵略集团不能对老挝“坐视不救”，如果老挝当局要求“援助”，东南亚集团将“愿意接受考虑”。西贡方面也不甘寂寞，6月14日的“越南时报”出来大喊大叫，要所谓“自由国家和东南亚条约组织”对老挝采取“坚定立场”。美帝国主义及其喽罗们的这一阵狂暴的叫嚣，赤裸裸地暴露了华盛顿侵略集团企图利用东南亚条约组织对老挝局势进行干涉的阴谋。亚洲和全世界爱好和平的国家和人民不能不对美国侵略势力阴谋破坏印度支那和平的严重局势予以密切的注意。
        拉丁美洲的新风暴
    美国的“后院”在过去半月里又卷起了新的风暴：古巴人民围绕着土地改革问题，开展了又一场反对美国干涉内政的斗争；尼加拉瓜爆发了反对美国傀儡索摩查独裁政权的武装斗争。
    古巴实施土地改革，对铲除古巴的封建庄园制度和摆脱美国垄断资本的经济束缚，具有十分重要的意义。它是古巴民族民主革命运动的重要内容。正因为如此，美国才下定决心要破坏古巴的土地改革。在古巴政府正式实施土地改革之前，美国反动报刊就大量散布所谓“土改不利于古巴经济”的论调，威胁说将发生另一次“危地马拉事件”，美国官方也不止一次地扬言将大大减少美国购买古巴蔗糖的定额。6月4日古巴正式公布并开始实施土地改革法以后，美国的破坏活动进入更加猖獗的阶段。美国垄断组织一方面勾结古巴的大庄园主发动了规模庞大的反对土地改革法的运动，鼓动小所有主游行示威；另一方面进行了种种阴谋活动，譬如，在古巴制造人为的经济混乱，唆使巴蒂斯塔分子进行反革命活动等等。6月11日，美国政府向古巴政府正式提出照会，公开干涉古巴内政，竟然无理要求古巴就土地改革问题同美国“进一步交换意见”。
    美帝国主义者的无耻干涉行为，受到了古巴人民和政府的强烈反击。卡斯特罗总理庄严地声明：古巴人民已经掌握自己的命运，在制订法律时用不着考虑别人的意见。他并且宣布将对抗拒土改的地主实行刑事制裁。目前，古巴各地人民纷纷行动起来抗议美帝国主义对古巴内政的无耻干涉。曾经以团结一致的行动在惩治巴蒂斯塔犯罪分子的问题上沉重地打击了美帝国主义的干涉活动的古巴人民，这次在土地改革的问题上，必将继续保持团结，给予美国干涉者以新的打击。
    美帝国主义者在干涉古巴内政的同时，也忙于干涉尼加拉瓜的内政，企图挽救即将崩溃的索摩查独裁政权。自从尼加拉瓜的政治流亡者领导的武装部队于5月31日和6月1日进入尼加拉瓜之后，尽管索摩查动员了优势兵力，仍然阻挡不住反政府军的前进。这次武装起义已经迅速发展为全国性的推翻暴政运动。尼加拉瓜各反对索摩查独裁政权的党派和一些政治流亡组织联合组成了“尼加拉瓜革命联盟”，号召推翻暴政、革新国家。各地居民纷纷参加了反政府军的队伍，索摩查的血腥镇压只能激起更多的尼加拉瓜人民投入反独裁的斗争。
    尼加拉瓜卷起的风暴，使美帝国主义的手脚又忙乱起来。美国于6月3、4两日在华盛顿连续召开了“美洲国家组织”的特别会议，同时又指使中美六个国家的内政部长于6月4、5两日在危地马拉举行会议。这些会议的情况表明，美国企图在“防止共产主义对中美地区的渗透”的幌子下，对尼加拉瓜爆发的武装斗争进行干涉。目前，美国正积极部署其干涉阴谋。但是，拉丁美洲各国人民反对美国干涉尼加拉瓜内政的运动也正在有力地展开。尼加拉瓜人民的反独裁斗争不是孤立的，他们有着拉丁美洲人民的支持和全世界的同情。在古巴人民推翻巴蒂斯塔独裁政权的光辉范例的鼓舞下，尼加拉瓜人民将会获得新的胜利。
