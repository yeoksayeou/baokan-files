Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 11th June: (Our reporter, Huang Changlu, reports) The more than six million minority people in Yunnan Province have received warm assistance from the vast number of Han cadres and people in carrying out democratic reforms and construction.

Yunnan is one of the provinces with the most ethnic groups in China. In addition to the Han people, there are 21 minority groups, accounting for nearly one-third of the province's total population. Most of the minority groups live in border areas and high and cold mountainous areas in the interior, and are relatively poor and backward. Some minority groups still retained the remnants of primitive communes and the slave system at the time of liberation. In the past few years, the state has allocated more than 30 million yuan in the form of relief, special subsidies, and low-interest loans to help ethnic minorities in border areas develop production and improve their lives. The Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Yunnan Provincial People's Committee have successively sent more than 10,000 cadres to remote minority areas to share weal and woe with the local people, develop production, open hospitals and schools, and help people of all ethnic groups complete democratic reforms and embark on the road of mutual aid and cooperation. In February last year, when the snow still sealed the Bilo Snow Mountain in the northwest plateau of Yunnan, the Lisu and Nu people west of the snow mountain were busy building farmland water conservancy. At that time, dynamite and tools were in short supply, and the materials sent by the state for support were blocked east of the snow mountain. At this difficult moment, more than 300 Han cadres and primary school teachers in the Nujiang Lisu Autonomous Prefecture braved the danger of their lives, climbed over the snow mountain at an altitude of more than 4,000 meters, and stepped out a path in the snow as high as telegraph poles, carrying more than 40,000 catties of water conservancy equipment and more than 60,000 catties of seeds over the snow mountain. The Lisu and Nu farmers on both sides of the Nujiang River also harvested an unprecedented bumper harvest last year. The Dulong people, who live on the west side of the Gaoligong Mountain, have a population of only more than 2,000, and are one of the ethnic minorities with the smallest population in China. A few years ago, they did not know how to grow rice, and there was no school or doctor. Under the care of the Party and the People's Government, batches of Han cadres were sent to climb over cliffs, cross suspension bridges, and walk for more than half a month to reach the Dulong River valley, teach the Dulong people to grow rice for the first time, and help the Dulong people open the first primary school and hospital.

The ethnic minorities in Yunnan have continuously received assistance from Han workers and peasants in the interior. When ethnic minorities in border areas who had already entered feudal society implemented land reform, Han peasants in the interior who had completed the reform earlier wrote letters to encourage their brotherly ethnic minorities in the border areas, reporting the vigorous development of production in the interior after the land reform, and received material support from Han peasants in the interior to help them solve difficulties in production. Local industry in ethnic minority areas in Yunnan started from scratch. The factories and mining enterprises in Kunming, under the circumstances of very heavy production tasks, transferred a group of technicians and excellent skilled workers to Dali, Chuxiong, Dehong, Honghe and other autonomous prefectures to help build factories. The factories and mines in Kunming also transferred a part of machine tools, generators and other equipment from clearing warehouses and existing production equipment to support the autonomous prefectures of Honghe, Chuxiong and Dali.

From their own experience, the ethnic minorities in Yunnan have realized the warmth of the big family of the motherland and realized that without the help of advanced ethnic groups, such rapid development would not be possible. The Nujiang Lisu Autonomous Prefecture, sandwiched between Gaoligong Mountain and Bilo Snow Mountain, was originally the poorest mountainous area on the Yunnan Plateau. At the time of liberation, food and various agricultural tools had to be transported from the interior. With the help of the Han people in the past few years, the prefecture is now self-sufficient in food, and has also refined local steel and iron and manufactured agricultural tools. In the past, the Kucong people who lived a nomadic life in the primitive forests have now mostly settled down with the help of Han cadres and people, learned to plant rice fields, and realized agricultural cooperativization.

    雪里送炭情意深  并肩携手同跃进
    云南汉族人民热情帮助兄弟民族建设家园
    新华社昆明11日电　本社记者黄昌禄报道：云南省六百多万少数民族人民在进行民主改革和建设事业中，得到广大汉族干部和人民的热情帮助。
    云南是我国民族最多的一个省，除汉族外，还有二十一个少数民族，占全省总人口的三分之一弱。少数民族大多居住在边疆地区和内地的高寒山区，比较贫困落后，有些少数民族在解放时还保存着原始公社的残余和奴隶制度。几年来，国家用救济、特殊补助和低息贷款等形式，共拨款三千多万元帮助边疆少数民族发展生产和改善生活。中共云南省委和云南省人民委员会先后派出了一万多名干部，深入到遥远偏僻的少数民族地区，和当地群众同甘共苦，发展生产，开办医院和学校，并帮助各族群众完成了民主改革和走上互助合作的道路。去年2月，当大雪还封住云南西北高原的碧罗雪山时，雪山西边的傈僳族和怒族人民正在大修农田水利，当时炸药和工具十分缺乏，而国家运来支援的物资却被阻留在雪山之东。在这困难的时刻，怒江傈僳族自治州的三百多名汉族干部和小学教师冒着生命危险，爬过拔海四千多公尺的雪山，在与电线杆一样高的积雪中踏开一条道路，把四万多斤水利器材和六万多斤种籽，背过了雪山。怒江两岸的傈僳族和怒族农民去年也获得了有史以来的空前大丰收。居住在高黎贡山西麓的独龙族，只有两千多人口，是我国人口最少的少数民族之一，几年前那里还不知道种植水稻，没有一所学校，一个医生。在党和人民政府的关怀下，派出了一批批的汉族干部，攀悬岩，过溜索，步行半月以上，到达独龙河谷，教会独龙人第一次种出了稻米，帮助独龙人开办了第一所小学和医院。
    云南各少数民族不断得到内地汉族工人、农民的援助。当边疆已经进入封建社会的少数民族实行土地改革时，完成改革较早的内地汉族农民，纷纷写信鼓励边疆兄弟民族，报告内地土改后生产蓬勃发展的情况，并且得到内地汉族农民物质上的支援，帮助他们解决生产中的困难。云南少数民族地区的地方工业是在一张白纸的基础上开始创办的。昆明各厂矿企业在生产任务十分繁重的情况下，曾抽调出一批技术人员和优秀技工到大理、楚雄、德宏、红河等自治州帮助建厂。昆明各厂矿还从清理仓库和从现有生产设备中，抽调了一部分机床、发电机和其它设备去支援红河、楚雄和大理等自治州。
    云南各少数民族从切身经验中体会到祖国大家庭的温暖，认识到如果没有先进民族的帮助，就不可能得到这样快的发展。夹在高黎贡山和碧罗雪山之间的怒江傈僳族自治州，原是云南高原最贫穷的一个山区，解放时，粮食和各种农具都要从内地运进去。经过几年来汉族的帮助，现在全州粮食可自给，并炼出了土钢土铁，制造农具。过去在原始森林中过游猎生活的苦聪人，现在大部分已在汉族干部和人民的帮助下定居下来，学会种水田，并实现了农业合作化。（附图片）
