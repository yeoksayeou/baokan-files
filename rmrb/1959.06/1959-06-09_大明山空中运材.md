Mount Daming, located in Changhua County, Zhejiang Province, is rich in bamboo and timber resources. The Changxi People's Commune in Changhua County has used local methods to build 306 bamboo-splint aerial cableways, bamboo and wood rails, and earthen chutes in the deep mountains and valleys. In five months, they transported 12,600 cubic meters of timber and more than 8,000 dan of charcoal, saving 50,400 workdays. (Photo attached)

    大明山空中运材
    浙江省昌化县境内的大明山盛产竹、木。昌化县昌西人民公社在深山峡谷里用土办法建起竹片架空索道、竹木轨道、土滑道等共三百零六处，在五个月中，用它运出木材一万二千六百立方公尺，木炭八千多担，节省劳力五万零四百个。（附图片）
    右图是大明山间的竹木轨道，用它运材比人工肩运提高效率一百四十倍。
