	Economic Bankruptcy, People Living in Poverty
	—South Korea under the Tyranny of the U.S. and Syngman Rhee
	Ke Xianwei
	For fourteen years, under the rule and plunder of U.S. imperialism and the Syngman Rhee clique, South Korea has been reduced to a colony and military base of U.S. imperialism. The national economy has been completely bankrupted, industry and agriculture have withered, and the people's lives are extremely miserable.

	Since the Korean armistice, the United States has been trying to make the South Korean economy serve its policy of preparing to re-ignite the war, and using "U.S. aid" as a means to dump surplus commodities and comprehensively control the South Korean economy. According to a report in the American "National Guardian" on June 1 this year, the United States has given South Korea economic "aid" of 2.5 billion U.S. dollars in the nine years since 1950, but most of it is surplus American commodities. Last year alone, it dumped another 50 million U.S. dollars of surplus agricultural products into South Korea. This year, the value of surplus commodities will account for 84% of the 225 million U.S. dollars of U.S. "aid." The Syngman Rhee clique used all the proceeds from selling these surplus materials on the market to cover military expenses. In the five years after the war (1954-1958), 70% of the proceeds were allocated to the Syngman Rhee clique as direct military expenses, and the remaining 30% was allocated as indirect military expenses.

	U.S. imperialism also controls all the economic lifelines of South Korea through the so-called "South Korea-U.S. Economic Cooperation Committee" which it created single-handedly. Since 1957, it has used the so-called "South Korea-U.S. Treaty of Friendship, Commerce, and Navigation" to allow American private capital to intervene in all commercial, industrial, financial, and other sectors of South Korea. From then on, the South Korean economy completely became a colonial economy dependent on the United States.

	The Syngman Rhee clique has consistently pursued a policy of expanding the military and preparing for war, and military expenditures have increased year by year. Since 1953, military and police expenditures have accounted for about 70% of the total budget each year. This year, "direct military expenses" alone amounted to 140.6 billion won (South Korean currency), an increase of 26 billion won compared to 1958. Together with police and administrative expenses, spending on military purposes accounted for about 95% of the total budget. Such huge military expenditures and hundreds of millions of administrative expenses and other non-productive expenses have brought huge fiscal deficits to South Korea. By the end of April 1959, the fiscal deficit had increased to 22.2 billion won, which is already close to the estimated budget deficit for the entire year in just four months. What is particularly shocking is that in the first quarter of this year, fiscal revenue was only a little over 40.4 billion won, while expenditures, mainly military expenses, were more than 58.5 billion won.

	In terms of foreign trade, there is also a huge deficit every year. In 1958, imports amounted to 76.04 million U.S. dollars, while exports were only 16.45 million U.S. dollars. The annual trade deficit was 59.59 million U.S. dollars, an increase of 13.64 million U.S. dollars compared to 1957. If the materials transported into South Korea under the guise of U.S. "aid" are included, imports in 1958 were 20.4 times the value of exports, while imports in 1957 were equivalent to 19.3 times the value of exports. The continuous huge trade deficit has deepened the financial and economic crisis in South Korea.

	In order to make up for the increasing fiscal deficit and trade deficit, the Syngman Rhee clique has issued a large amount of currency indiscriminately. In 1958 alone, hundreds of billions of won were issued. By the end of February 1959, the amount of currency in circulation had broken the 200 billion won mark, reaching 223.2 billion won, an expansion of nearly twenty times the amount when the Syngman Rhee clique implemented the "currency system policy" in February 1953. Due to malignant inflation, prices in South Korea have soared. According to recent reports in American newspapers, "In the past ten years, prices in South Korea have risen a hundredfold."

	Under these circumstances, South Korea's national industry is on the road to complete bankruptcy. Factories are closing down, production scales are shrinking, and output is constantly declining. At present, South Korea's total industrial output value has been reduced to half of what it was at the end of Japanese rule. South Korea has almost no heavy industry needed for an independent economy. The only two steel plants, Incheon Steel Plant and Samhwa Steel Works, are currently in a state of partial or complete shutdown. "Dongyang Chemical Factory" has been unable to produce for more than ten years due to the crowding out of American chemical products. Light industry is also dying. The textile industry, which accounts for the largest proportion of South Korea's industry, has declared bankruptcy one after another due to the flooding of American cotton and fiber fabrics and the soaring prices of American raw cotton. For example, in Daegu, the center of South Korea's textile industry, 52% of the textile factories had closed down by March 1959. In addition, small and medium-sized enterprises, which account for 99% of the number of production enterprises in South Korea, have closed down one after another. This is the most prominent phenomenon in South Korea's industrial economy. Now more than 70% of small and medium-sized enterprises have stopped production, of which 31.9% have gone bankrupt because there is no market for their products.

	South Korea, which has always been known as a "granary," is also in a serious crisis in agricultural production. In the past, South Korea could ship hundreds of thousands of tons of rice abroad every year, but now it has become a land of hunger where it has to import more than 700,000 tons of grain from foreign countries every year. Half of the total number of farm households are on the verge of starvation. Due to the U.S. invading army seizing farmland to expand military bases and strategic highways, the current planting area in South Korea has been reduced by 600,000 chobu (approximately 15 mu per chobu) compared with the period of Japanese rule, and the total grain output has decreased by 40%. The planting area of cash crops has also been reduced to half of what it was before the war, and output has fallen unprecedentedly. For example, South Korea's cotton production in 1958 was only one-fifth of what it was before 1945.

	The bankruptcy of South Korea's industry and agriculture has facilitated the dumping of industrial and agricultural products by the United States, while plunging the South Korean working people into dire straits.

	Currently, South Korea is full of unemployment and starvation. According to South Korea's "Industrial Economic News," the number of unemployed people in South Korea has recently reached 6.6 million, accounting for 28% of the total population. This huge army of unemployed people wanders the streets, sells their children, and suicides are increasing day by day. In Busan alone, an average of 20 suicides occur every day. Those who are fortunate enough to find work are forced to engage in slave labor all day long, but can only receive wages equivalent to one-third of the minimum living expenses. According to materials published by the "Korea Bank Research Department" in South Korea, in the second half of 1958, the average monthly wage for miners and heavy industrial workers was 35,000 won, and for workers in light industrial sectors it was 24,000 won; while the same materials stated that the living expenses of a family of five in Seoul require 52,000 won per month.

	The lives of farmers are even more miserable. According to the Syngman Rhee clique's investigation materials, farmers' actual income in 1958 was only one-third of what it was in 1936. More than 90% of farmers are heavily indebted. According to estimates by the South Korean authorities, at the end of last year, the total debt of farmers and fishermen had reached more than 140 billion won, with an average debt of more than 50,000 won per household, compared with 8,930 won in 1954. According to "Jeonnam Daily," 70% of the debt owed by farmers is high-interest loans with an annual interest rate of 20% or more. Even so, South Korean farmers are still forced to bear 80% of the Syngman Rhee clique's fiscal revenue. Unable to bear the exploitation of the Syngman Rhee clique, landlords, and usurers, many farmers have been reduced to landless hired laborers or tenant farmers, and more people have had to leave their homes and beg everywhere. Tens of thousands of farmers use livestock feed such as rice bran and soybean dregs to fill their hunger, and even live on grass roots and bark.

	More than 200,000 malnourished and emaciated war orphans, without relatives or support, are displaced and live by scavenging and begging, and many die from starvation. In addition, more than 500,000 war widows abandon their children because they cannot support them, leaving hundreds of thousands of children to wander around. These innocent children have become the objects of the U.S.-Syngman Rhee clique's profiteering from human trafficking. According to incomplete statistics, from 1954 to the beginning of 1959, 2,540 children were sold to the United States. In South Korea, 440,000 children are out of school, and more than 500,000 have lost the opportunity to go to school. Even students who are in school are often kicked out of school because they cannot afford expensive tuition and miscellaneous fees. Many students are forced to sell their blood to raise tuition fees. According to statistics, the "Central Blood Bank" and "Baik Hospital" alone purchased 92,000 cc of fresh blood from 3,374 college students last year, and the number of students forced to sell their blood is increasing.

	South Korea under the tyranny of the U.S. and Syngman Rhee has become a living hell shrouded in darkness and death, unemployment and hunger. This is in stark contrast to the rapid economic development and increasingly happy lives of the people in northern Korea. The more than 20 million people in South Korea clearly recognize that their disasters stem from the colonial rule of U.S. imperialism in South Korea. Only by driving the U.S. imperialist invading army out of South Korea and realizing the peaceful reunification of Korea can the South Korean people see the light of day. The government and people of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea are making unremitting efforts to save their South Korean compatriots, withdraw U.S. troops from South Korea, and seek the peaceful reunification of Korea.

    经济破产　民不聊生
    ——美李暴政下的南朝鲜
    柯贤伟
    十四年来，在美帝国主义和李承晚集团的统治和掠夺下，南朝鲜已沦为美帝国主义的殖民地和军事基地，民族经济遭到全面破产，工农业雕蔽，人民生活极其痛苦。
    朝鲜停战以来，美国竭力使南朝鲜经济服务于准备重新挑起战争的政策，并以“美援”为手段，倾销剩余商品，对南朝鲜经济进行全面控制。据今年6月1日美国“国民前卫报”报道，自1950年以来的九年中，美国给了南朝鲜的经济“援助”达二十五亿美元，但其中绝大部分是美国剩余商品。单是去年就又向南朝鲜倾泻了五千万美元的剩余农产品。今年剩余商品的价值将占美国“援助”的二亿二千五百多万美元中的84％。而李承晚集团把这些剩余物资在市场上倾销后所得的货款，全部用来充当军费。在战后五年内（1954—1958年）70％的货款拨给李承晚集团作为直接军费，其余30％拨为间接军费。
    美帝国主义还通过由它一手制造的所谓“韩美经济合作委员会”控制着南朝鲜的一切经济命脉。1957年起，更通过所谓“韩美友好通商条约和航海条约”，使美国私人资本插足于南朝鲜所有商业、工业、金融和其它部门。南朝鲜经济从此完全成了依赖美国的殖民地经济。
    李承晚集团一直奉行扩军备战政策，军费开支与年俱增。1953年以来，每年的军事和警察费占总预算的70％左右。今年，“直接军费”就达一千四百零六亿圜（南朝鲜币名），比1958年增加了二百六十亿圜，加上警察费和行政费，花在军事用途的占全部预算的95％左右。如此庞大的军费及数以亿计的行政费等非生产性开支，给南朝鲜带来了巨额财政赤字。到1959年4月底财政赤字已增加到二百二十二亿圜，仅仅只有四个月光景，就已接近今年全年预计的预算赤字。尤其惊人的是，今年第一季度的财政收入只有四百零四亿多圜，而以军费为主的支出却有五百八十五亿多圜。
    在对外贸易方面，也年年发生巨大逆差，1958年进口额达七千六百零四万美元，而出口额只有一千六百四十五万美元，全年入超达五千九百五十九万美元，比1957年增长了一千三百六十四万美元。如果把美国所谓“援助”名目下运入南朝鲜的物资计算在内，1958年进口额等于出口额的二十点四倍，而1957年进口额也相当于出口额的十九点三倍。对外贸易上的不断巨额入超，加深了南朝鲜财政经济的危机。
    为了弥补不断增加的财政赤字及贸易逆差，李承晚集团大量滥发货币。仅1958年就发行了数百亿圜货币。到1959年2月底，通货发行量突破二千亿圜大关，达到二千二百三十二亿圜，膨胀到约近1953年2月李承晚集团实行“币制政策”时的二十倍。由于恶性的通货膨胀，南朝鲜物价飞腾上涨。据美国报纸最近报道，“在过去十年中，南朝鲜的物价上涨了一百倍。”
    在这种情况下，南朝鲜的民族工业走上彻底破产的道路，工厂倒闭，生产规模缩小，产量不断下降。目前，南朝鲜的工业总产值降低到日本统治末期的一半。南朝鲜几乎没有为独立经济所需的重工业，仅有的两座钢铁厂——仁川钢厂和三和制铁所，目前陷于半停工与停工状态。“东洋化学工厂”十多年来一直由于美国化学制品的排挤而没能生产。轻工业也奄奄待毙。在南朝鲜工业中占最大比重的纺织业，就由于美国棉织品和纤维织品的泛滥及美国原棉价格的暴涨而纷纷宣告破产。例如南朝鲜的纺织工业中心——大丘市的纺织厂到1959年3月已有52％倒闭。此外占南朝鲜生产企业数目99％的中小企业纷纷倒闭，这是南朝鲜工业经济中最为突出的现象。现在已有70％以上的中小企业停止生产，其中有31.9％是因为没有销路而破产。
    从来号称为“谷仓”的南朝鲜，农业生产也陷于严重危机中。过去南朝鲜每年可以运往国外几十万吨大米，而现在却已变成了每年不得不从外国输入七十多万吨粮食的饥饿之乡。占总农户半数的农户，已陷于断粮的境地。由于美国侵略军强占耕地，扩建军事基地和战略公路，目前南朝鲜的播种面积已较日寇统治时期减少了六十万町步（每町步约合十五市亩），谷物总产量减少了40％。经济作物的播种面积也缩减为战前的一半，产量空前下降。例如1958年南朝鲜的棉花产量只及1945年以前产量的五分之一。
    南朝鲜工农业的破产，便利了美国倾销工农业品，而使南朝鲜劳动人民陷于水深火热之中。
    目前南朝鲜失业成群，饿莩遍野。据南朝鲜“产业经济新闻”透露，南朝鲜最近失业人数已达六百六十万人，占总人口的28％。这支庞大的失业大军，流浪街头，鬻儿卖女，自杀日多，在釜山市每天就平均要发生二十起自杀案。侥幸获得工作的人，终日被迫进行奴隶劳动，但只能领到相当于最低生活费三分之一的工资。据南朝鲜的“韩国银行调查部”发表的材料，1958年下半年，矿工和重工业工人每月平均工资为三万五千圜，轻工业部门的工人为二万四千圜；而在同一材料中说，在汉城一家五口一月的生活费需要五万二千圜。
    农民的生活更是苦不堪言。据李承晚集团的调查材料，1958年农民的实际收入只有1936年的三分之一。90％以上的农民都是负债累累。据南朝鲜当局估计，去年年底，农民和渔民总负债额已达一千四百多亿圜，平均每户农户有五万多圜的债务，而1954年为八千九百三十圜。据“全南日报”说，农民所负的债务中70％为年息20％以上的高利贷。即使这样，南朝鲜农民还得被迫担负着李承晚集团的80％的财政收入。由于不堪李承晚集团及地主、高利贷者的敲骨吸髓，许多农民已经沦为没有一坪土地的雇农或佃农，更多的人不得不背乡离井、到处求乞。成千成万农民以米糠、豆渣等牲口饲料充饥，甚至以草根树皮度日。
    二十多万营养失调、骨瘦如柴的战争孤儿，举目无亲，流离失所，靠拣垃圾和求乞过活，大量因饿病而死。此外，还有五十多万战争寡妇因无法扶养而遗弃儿女，使几十万儿童到处流浪。这些无辜的孩子成了美李集团贩卖人口获取暴利的对象。据不完全统计，自1954年到1959年初，就有二千五百四十名儿童被出卖到美国去。南朝鲜有四十四万儿童失学，五十多万失去升学机会。就是在学的学生也往往因缴不起昂贵的学杂费而被撵出校门，许多学生为了筹措学费，被迫出卖血液。据统计，仅“中央血液银行”和“白医院”两家在去年一年中就从三千三百七十四名大学生中买了九万二千西西鲜血，被迫出卖血液的学生正在与日俱增。
    美李暴政下的南朝鲜已成为黑暗和死亡、失业和饥饿所笼罩的人间地狱。这同朝鲜北部经济一日千里，人民生活日益幸福的景象形成强烈的对照。南朝鲜二千多万人民清楚地认识到他们的灾难是根源于美帝国主义在南朝鲜的殖民统治，只有把美帝国主义侵略军赶出南朝鲜，实现朝鲜的和平统一，南朝鲜人民才能得见天日。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府和人民为拯救南朝鲜同胞，使美军撤出南朝鲜，谋求朝鲜的和平统一而进行着不懈的斗争。
