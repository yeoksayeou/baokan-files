Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 3rd: The results of the local constituency voting in the Japanese House of Councillors election were announced this afternoon. The Japan Socialist Party won two more seats in the local constituencies than before the election.

It was announced that the Socialist Party had a total of twenty-one candidates elected in local constituencies where the ruling Liberal Democratic Party has strong influence and strict control. Before the election, the Socialist Party had nineteen elected members in the local constituencies. Now, the newly elected members of the Socialist Party, plus the members who were not up for re-election (forty-seven members), have reached sixty-eight members. In addition, with the two seats held by the Communist Party, which cooperates with the Socialist Party in the struggle to uphold the Japanese Constitution that prohibits war and opposes the Kishi Nobusuke government's policy of reviving militarism, the seats held by the Japanese democratic forces in the House of Councillors have reached seventy.

Of the seventy-five members elected in the local constituencies, the Liberal Democratic Party occupies forty-nine seats, independents three seats, and the Ryokufukai two seats.

Currently, the results of the national constituency voting are being tallied. Fifty-two members will be elected in the national constituency.

If the candidates of the Socialist Party and the Communist Party can win fourteen seats in the national constituency (originally twelve), they can reach the more than one-third of the seats necessary to prevent the Kishi Nobusuke group from amending the Constitution—eighty-four seats.

    日本参院选举的地方选区投票结果
    民主力量所得议席较前增加
    选举的结局将取决于全国选区的投票结果
    新华社3日讯　东京消息：日本参议员选举的地方选区投票结果在今天下午揭晓。日本社会党在地方选区当选的参议员比选举前增加了两席。
    据宣布，在执政的自由民主党势力较强、控制较严的地方选区，社会党共有二十一名候选人当选。选举前，社会党在地方选区中当选的议员是十九名。现在，社会党新当选的议员加上原来不改选的议员
  （四十七名）已经达到六十八名。再加上在维护禁止战争的日本宪法和反对岸信介政府恢复军国主义政策的斗争中同社会党合作的共产党所拥有的不改选的两个议席，日本民主力量在参议院中保有的议席已经达到七十席。
    在地方选区中选出的七十五名议员中，自由民主党占四十九名，无党派人士三名，绿风会两名。
    目前，全国选区的投票结果正在统计中。在全国选区中将选出五十二名议员。
    如果社会党和共产党的候选人能在全国选区中有十四人当选（原来是十二人），就可以达到为阻止岸信介集团修改宪法所必需的三分之一以上的议席——八十四席。
