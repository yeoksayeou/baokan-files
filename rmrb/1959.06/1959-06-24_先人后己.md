　　Putting Others Before Yourself

　　The situation in Shanghai's scientific community is encouraging: they closely link scientific research with practical production and put in all kinds of hard work; they conduct extensive cooperation with universities and production units. What is even more encouraging is that the research units participating in the cooperation are all acting in the spirit of putting the country before the local, and putting others before themselves. This embodies the principle of "the whole country as one chessboard" and promotes the communist style of great collaboration.

　　At present, some scientific workers still have concerns about losing something in the practice of collaboration, and also have concerns about not getting something. Even some scientific research units, after implementing collaboration, have already gained something, but still feel as if they have lost something. These scientific workers and scientific research units need to learn the spirit of Shanghai well, dispel their concerns, and put the country before the local, and put others before themselves.

    先人后己
    上海科学界的景况令人振奋：他们把科学研究紧密地同生产实际联系起来，付出各种各样艰苦的劳动；他们同高等学校、生产单位广泛进行协作。更令人振奋的是：参加协作的研究单位，都本着先国家后地方、先人后己的精神。这就体现了“全国一盘棋”的方针和发扬了共产主义大协作的风格。
    现在，某些科学工作者，在协作的实践中，还有着怕失掉什么的顾虑，也有怕得不到什么的顾虑。甚至某些科学研究单位，在实行协作后，已经各有所得了，但还感到若有所失。这些科学工作者和科学研究单位，需要很好地学习上海的精神，打消顾虑，做到先国家后地方、先人后己。
