Xinhua News Agency, Benxi, June 3rd - The National Conference on Large and Medium-Sized Blast Furnace Experience Exchange, which closed in Benxi on the 1st, called on iron and steel enterprises nationwide with large and medium-sized blast furnaces to continue to deepen the mass movement centered on technological innovation and technological revolution, actively implement the blast furnace operation policy of simultaneously increasing smelting intensity and reducing coke ratio, improve the production and quality of pig iron, and ensure the completion and over-fulfillment of this year's steel production tasks.

The conference analyzed the national ironmaking production situation and existing problems, summarized and exchanged advanced experiences in the production of large and medium-sized blast furnaces since the Great Leap Forward, and formulated the main economic and technical indicators and technical organization measures for blast furnace production in 1959. It also called on workers and staff of large and medium-sized blast furnaces nationwide to continue to exert their efforts, strive for the top, and take various effective measures to rapidly improve pig iron production and quality.

Representatives attending the meeting unanimously agreed in the discussions that actively implementing the operation policy of simultaneously increasing smelting intensity and reducing coke ratio is an effective way to rapidly increase pig iron production. They pointed out that the practice in 1958 and the first five months of this year has proven that implementing this operation policy is of great significance. Since Benxi No. 1 Steel Plant implemented this policy in April last year, the blast furnace utilization coefficient has remained above two from September last year to the present, and further increased to above 2.4 in May this year, consistently leading among medium-sized blast furnaces nationwide. After Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company adopted this policy, the utilization coefficient also reached above two for several months. Anshan Iron and Steel's No. 9 Blast Furnace has also achieved outstanding production since adopting this operation policy last year, especially from April this year to the present, with the utilization coefficient reaching above two for two consecutive months, winning the national championship for large blast furnaces in May. The representatives pointed out that the average utilization coefficient of most blast furnaces nationwide is currently still only below 1.5. If large and medium-sized blast furnaces nationwide earnestly learn from the experiences of advanced blast furnaces in iron and steel enterprises such as Benxi, Anshan, and Taiyuan, and universally raise the utilization coefficient to the level of advanced blast furnaces, then national pig iron production will greatly increase without increasing equipment or manpower. This is of great significance for ensuring the completion of the 1959 pig iron production task.

In order to better and more comprehensively implement the operation policy of simultaneously increasing smelting intensity and reducing coke ratio, the conference put forward seven specific requirements: continuously emancipating the mind, carrying out mass movements, carrying out large-scale cooperation centered on blast furnace production, improving raw material conditions, improving operating techniques, improving equipment, and improving management. In terms of improving raw material conditions, sintering and coke screening should be gradually implemented, using graded materials for different furnaces, increasing the iron content of ore and the quality of coke, and at the same time increasing ore production so that blast furnaces can eat well and eat their fill. In addition, self-fluxing pellets should be gradually used, which has proven to be an important measure for increasing pig iron production in enterprises such as Anshan Iron and Steel and Benxi Iron and Steel. In terms of technical operations, the charging system should be continuously improved, appropriate tuyere velocity should be controlled, the potential of hot blast stoves should be fully utilized, the dry air temperature should be increased as much as possible, and blast furnaces with high-pressure furnace top equipment should make good use of the role of high-pressure operation. At the same time, equipment should be continuously improved, equipment maintenance and repair work should be strengthened, and the downtime rate should be greatly reduced.

The conference believes that while increasing pig iron production, it is necessary to pay attention to improving pig iron quality and ensure that the iron is good iron. The qualified rate of pig iron in large and medium-sized blast furnaces nationwide should reach above 98%. In order to achieve this indicator, the conference requires all enterprises to strictly implement operating procedures, strengthen the inspection and acceptance system for raw materials, and ensure the quality of raw materials entering the furnace. At the same time, promote effective domestic operating experiences in improving quality.

The conference emphasized that any technical measures, divorced from the leadership of the Party and the broad masses, cannot achieve good results. Therefore, when implementing the operation policy of simultaneously increasing smelting intensity and reducing coke ratio, all enterprises must put politics in command, continue to emancipate the mind under the unified leadership of the Party, continue to carry out mass movements on a large scale, carry out technological innovation and technological revolution, and fully mobilize the enthusiasm of workers and staff.

This conference started on May 25 and lasted for eight days. More than 300 representatives from metallurgical bureaus and their affiliated key iron and steel enterprises in fifteen provinces and cities including Hebei, Shandong, Yunnan, Shanghai, and Beijing, as well as representatives from ironmaking enterprises under the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, participated in the conference. The conference listened to reports from Soviet experts and issued a proposal to workers and staff of large and medium-sized blast furnaces nationwide. At the end of the conference, award flags were awarded to advanced units such as Benxi No. 1 Steel Plant, Anshan Iron and Steel's No. 3 and No. 9 Blast Furnaces, and Taiyuan Iron and Steel's No. 1 Blast Furnace.

    提高冶炼强度降低焦比就能增产
    全国大中型高炉会议交流经验表扬先进单位
    据新华社本溪3日电　1日在本溪闭幕的全国大中型高炉经验交流会议，要求全国拥有大中型高炉的炼铁企业，继续深入开展以技术革新和技术革命为中心的群众运动，积极贯彻执行提高冶炼强度和降低焦比双管齐下的高炉操作方针，提高生铁的产量和质量，保证完成和超额完成今年的钢铁生产任务。
    会议分析了全国炼铁生产的形势和存在的问题，总结和交流了大跃进以来大中型高炉生产上的先进经验，拟订了1959年高炉生产的主要经济技术指标和技术组织措施方案。并要求全国大中型高炉职工继续鼓足干劲，力争上游，采取各种有效措施，迅速提高生铁产量和质量。
    参加会议的代表们在讨论中一致认为，积极贯彻提高冶炼强度和降低焦比双管齐下的操作方针，是迅速增加生铁产量的有效的途径。他们指出，1958年和今年头五个月的实践证明，执行这一操作方针有着十分重大的意义。本溪第一钢铁厂从去年4月执行这个方针后，高炉利用系数从去年9月到现在一直保持在二以上，今年5月更进一步提高到二点四以上，一直在全国中型高炉中领先；太原钢铁公司采取这个方针后，利用系数也有好几个月达到二以上；鞍钢九号高炉去年以来采取了这一操作方针，生产也很出色，特别是从今年4月到现在，利用系数已经连续两个月达到二以上的水平，5月份获得全国大型高炉的冠军。代表们指出，目前全国大多数高炉的利用系数平均还只在一点五以下，如果全国大中型高炉认真学习本溪、鞍山、太原等炼铁企业先进高炉的经验，普遍把利用系数提高到先进高炉的水平，那么全国生铁产量在不增加设备、人力的情况下，就将会有很大的增长。这对保证完成1959年生铁生产任务有着很大的意义。
    为了更好更全面地贯彻执行提高冶炼强度和降低焦比双管齐下的操作方针，会议提出了不断解放思想、开展群众运动、开展以高炉生产为中心的大协作、改善原料条件、改进操作技术、改进设备和改善管理等七方面的具体要求。在改善原料条件方面，要逐步实现烧结和焦炭过筛，分级分炉使用，提高矿石含铁量和焦炭质量，同时要增加矿石产量，使高炉吃得饱吃得好；此外，要逐步使用自熔性球团矿，这在鞍钢、本钢等企业已证明是提高生铁产量的重要措施。在技术操作方面，要不断地改进装料制度，控制适当的风口风速，充分发挥热风炉的潜力，尽量提高干风温度，有高压炉顶设备的高炉要很好发挥高压操作的作用；同时要不断改进设备，加强设备维护检修工作，大大降低休风率。
    会议认为，在提高生铁产量同时，必须注意提高生铁质量，保证铁是好铁。全国大中型高炉的生铁合格率要达到98％以上。为了实现这个指标，会议要求各企业严格贯彻操作规程，加强原料的检验和验收制度，保证入炉原料的质量。同时推广国内行之有效的提高质量方面的操作经验。
    会议强调指出，任何技术措施，离开了党的领导和广大群众，都不能取得良好的效果，因此，各企业在贯彻提高冶炼强度降低焦比双管齐下的操作方针时，必须政治挂帅，在党的统一领导下，继续解放思想，继续大搞群众运动，大搞技术革新和技术革命，充分发挥职工群众的积极性。
    这次会议是5月25日开始的，历时八天。参加会议的有河北、山东、云南、上海、北京等十五个省市冶金局及其所属重点钢铁企业的代表，有冶金工业部所属各炼铁企业的代表，共三百多人。会议听取了苏联专家的报告，并且向全国大中型高炉职工发出了倡议书。会议最后还给本溪第一钢铁厂、鞍钢三号和九号高炉、太原钢铁厂一号高炉等先进单位，颁发了奖旗。
