“Adenauer's Shadow” and Others
West German Delegation Makes a Fool of Itself in Geneva

	Adenauer's Shadow
	Although Brentano holds the official position of West German Foreign Minister, it is rumored throughout Geneva that this foreign minister has no independent thinking or freedom of action. One of his main tasks is to record word for word the instructions that Adenauer transmits by telephone, including instructions on the most detailed matters of the delegation. Given that Brentano's obedience to Adenauer has reached an extreme level, some people call Brentano "Adenauer's Shadow."

	The "International Law Experts'" Discovery
	At the conference table for the foreign ministers' meeting, contrary to the usual practice of previous meetings, there were no signs indicating the names of the countries represented by the delegations. According to insiders, this was the result of repeated requests from the West German delegation to the Western foreign ministers. This is because a group of "international law experts" in the West German delegation believed that if the table of Foreign Minister Bolz was labeled with the name of the country he represented, it would be interpreted as "unintentional recognition of the German Democratic Republic."

	Thus, any signs indicating countries were removed from the conference table. Interestingly, Adenauer and his ilk, fearing to see anything symbolizing the existence of the German Democratic Republic, would rather do without even the name of the country they represent.

	A Bizarre Theory for Shared Enjoyment
	The French newspaper "Le Figaro" published an interview with Brentano. Brentano repeatedly told the reporter that he would never cross the threshold of the League of Nations building, which served as the venue for the Foreign Ministers' Conference, under any circumstances.

	Brentano further explained to the reporter that he acted in this way because he had nothing to do at the Foreign Ministers' Conference. What a bizarre theory! At a meeting discussing the future of Germany, the West German Foreign Minister openly declared that he had "nothing to do." It takes a certain skill to say such things without blushing.

	The Most Outstanding "Diplomat"
	From West Germany comes this humor: Among the members of the West German delegation attending the Geneva Conference, the most outstanding diplomat should be Grewe's driver. Where does this title come from? It turns out that people once discovered this driver drinking beer and chatting amicably with Foreign Minister Bolz's driver.

	News has it that after the West German delegation's driver's contact with personnel from the German Democratic Republic was revealed, Grewe felt very embarrassed, and Brentano flew into a rage. (Attached picture)

	Adenauer (to Brentano): "You must act according to these instructions in Geneva."

    “阿登纳的影子”及其他
    西德代表团在日内瓦出洋相
    阿登纳的影子
    勃伦塔诺虽然官居西德外交部长职，但是日内瓦全城传闻，这位外长毫无独立思考和自由行动的能力。他的一项主要工作是逐字逐句记下阿登纳从电话中传来的指示，包括对代表团最细节问题的指示。鉴于勃伦塔诺服从阿登纳已经到无以复加的程度，有人称勃伦塔诺为“阿登纳的影子”。
    “国际法专家”的发现
    在外长们集会的会议桌上，一反历次会议习惯，没有标明代表团国家名称的标志。据熟悉内幕人士称，这是西方国家外长在西德代表团再三恳求下的产物。因为西德代表团中有一批“国际法专家”认为，如果在博尔茨外长的桌上用文字注明他代表的国家，将被人解释为“对德意志民主共和国无意的承认”。
    这样，在会议桌上就取消了标明国家的任何标志。有趣的是，阿登纳之流由于怕见象征德意志民主共和国存在的任何事物，就连自己所代表的国家名称也宁愿不要了。
    怪论共赏
    法国“费加罗报”发表了访勃伦塔诺的访问记。勃伦塔诺一再对该报记者说：他在任何情况下决不跨过作为外长会议场所的国联大厦的门槛。
    勃伦塔诺进一步对记者解释说，他所以如此行事，是因为他在外长会议上无事可做。真是奇哉怪论！在讨论德国前途的会议上，西德外长公然宣称自己“无事可做”。说这种话而不脸红，也是一种本事。
    最杰出的“外交家”
    从西德传来这样的幽默：出席日内瓦会议的西德代表团人员中，最杰出的外交家该属格雷韦的司机。这个称呼从何而来？原来一次人们发现这位司机同博尔茨外长的司机共饮啤酒并友好交谈。
    有消息说，这位西德代表团的司机同德意志民主共和国人员发生接触之事传出后，格雷韦感到十分狼狈，勃伦塔诺则暴跳如雷。（附图片）
    阿登纳（对勃伦塔诺）：“你必须据此指示在日内瓦行事。”
