    Welcome the Publication of "Read More Good Books"
    Jiangsu Yizheng Normal School, Ye Bida

    Recently, I saw the first collection of "Read More Good Books" compiled and printed by the Xinhua Bookstore Beijing Distribution Office. I feel that such a publication, with the spirit of serving readers, recommending recently published good books to the vast number of readers, is very meaningful.

    At present, the vast number of readers are thirsting for political theory readings and excellent literary works. When they see a good book, they all rush to introduce it and compete to read it. Therefore, helping young students choose books is a very important task at present. However, teachers are busy with teaching and cannot browse many books, so it is more difficult to recommend them. At the same time, the libraries of institutions and schools are small in scale, and they need to be more selective when purchasing books. In this case, with the recommendation of "Read More Good Books," they can choose to supply some necessary spiritual food. Taking our school as an example, because we saw "Read More Good Books," we bought more than a dozen copies of the books that were heavily recommended above, and made a brief introduction on the blackboard bulletin, which promoted the reading movement throughout the school and guided the students to read in a planned way. I hope that "Read More Good Books" can be published frequently and not be interrupted for too long.

    欢迎“多读好书”的出刊
    江苏仪征师范　叶必达
    最近看到新华书店北京发行所编印的“多读好书”第一辑，感到这样的刊物以服务于读者的精神，向广大读者推荐最近出版的好书，是很有意义的。
    现在，广大读者对政治理论读物和优秀的文学著作的阅读，如饥似渴，看到一本好书，莫不争相介绍，竞相阅读。因此，帮助青年学生选择图书，是目前很重要的工作。但是教师忙于教学，不可能浏览很多的书，推荐起来也较困难，同时，机关学校图书馆规模较小，购买图书需要多加选择，在这样情况下，有了“多读好书”的推荐，就可以选择供应一些必要的精神食粮。以我校为例，因为看到了“多读好书”，就把上面重点推荐的书各买了十多本，并且在黑板报上作了扼要的介绍，这就推动了全校的读书运动，指导同学们有计划地阅读，希望“多读好书”能经常出刊，不要中断得太久。
