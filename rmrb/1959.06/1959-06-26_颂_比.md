From the materials reflected from various aspects, "comparison" is a good method for launching mass movements. This method can fully develop and display the soaring enthusiasm, the communist style of daring to think, speak, and act, the vigorous enterprising spirit, and the tenacious fighting spirit of workers, peasants, and intellectuals under the leadership of the Communist Party in the process of building socialism. Each of these qualities is worthy of our praise.

In the practice of building socialism, one of the most widely used and effective forms of mass movement is socialist emulation. Emulation is "comparison." Therefore, sometimes some people simply call emulation "competition." What "compare advanced," "compare enthusiasm," "compare style," "compare measures," "compare output," "compare quality," "compare reducing costs," "compare improving labor productivity," and so on. When competitions are held between individuals or collectives, almost none of the challenge conditions lack the meaning of "comparison" or contain the meaning of "comparison." In the course of the competition, the soaring enthusiasm of the masses to strive for the upper reaches, in the words of the masses themselves, is: "Who is a hero, who is a good man, let's compete at the heroes' meeting." "Who is a hero, who is a good man, let's meet at the end-of-month evaluation."

Some people may ask, why are the workers, peasants, and intellectuals so enthusiastic in the process of building socialism, the communist style is so high, the enterprising spirit is so vigorous, and the fighting spirit is so high?

This is primarily because the workers, peasants, and revolutionary intellectuals under the socialist system have completely eliminated the capitalist system of man exploiting man, and therefore, their labor is all for themselves, for their own country, and for the happiness of their own descendants, rather than for increasing profits for capitalists. Therefore, in their view, labor is no longer a cursed, disgusting, despicable, and lowly thing, but has become the most heroic and glorious cause.

Secondly, it is because they are primarily workers, a newborn social force. And this newborn social force, under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism, is engaged in socialism and communism, which is "sweeping across the world with the force of an avalanche and the power of a thunderbolt, and retaining its beautiful youth" ("On New Democracy"). How can this newborn social force be compared with or counteracted by the capitalist forces and their undertakings, which have long been "setting in the west, breathing weakly, and in imminent danger of death"? This newborn social force, although it does not appear as large as the old forces at the beginning, has a vigorous vitality, and it is a "spark that can start a prairie fire."

Thirdly, it is because these newborn social forces have the correct and strong leadership of the Communist Party. Moreover, the combat experience of this leading force is becoming increasingly rich, the Marxist-Leninist ideological and political level is constantly improving, and the organizational force is constantly developing and expanding. With this kind of leadership, workers, peasants, and revolutionary intellectuals are like tigers with wings, invincible in the world.

In addition, "comparison" is also a very good method of understanding and explaining problems, that is, a very good way of thinking and propaganda method.

People often cannot see clearly or understand the right and wrong, the advantages and disadvantages of a certain thing all at once. But if the method of "comparison" is adopted, it is easy to see clearly and understand. As the saying goes, "You are not afraid of not knowing the goods, but you are afraid of comparing goods." "When weighing two benefits (the meaning of comparison), take the greater; when weighing two evils, take the lesser" are all illustrations of the role and benefits of "comparison." Chairman Mao is the most adept at using this method of "comparison" to understand and explain problems. Everyone knows that in the War of Resistance Against Japan, the only correct strategic policy that guided and guaranteed the final victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, namely the protracted war, was derived from Chairman Mao's specific comparison (analysis) of the favorable and unfavorable conditions of the enemy, ourselves, and our friends. Chairman Mao's book "On Protracted War" is largely devoted to the comparison of the situations of the enemy, ourselves, and our friends. As a way of thinking, "comparison" can enhance people's confidence in victory when the environment of work or struggle is difficult; when the environment of work or struggle is favorable, it can prevent or eliminate people's complacency. An example of the former is that in 1930, when the Chinese revolution was at a low ebb, some comrades lacked confidence in the victory of the revolutionary struggle at that time. In order to enhance the comrades' confidence in the victory of the revolutionary struggle at that time, Chairman Mao, in the article "A Single Spark Can Start a Prairie Fire," made a penetrating and convincing analysis of the international and domestic situation at that time using the method of "comparison," and in the conclusion, used vivid metaphors to point out the scene of the imminent arrival of the high tide of the Chinese revolution - "It is a ship standing on the coast watching the sea with the tip of the mast already visible, it is a round of rising sun standing on the top of a high mountain looking far to the east already seeing light shining in all directions about to burst forth, it is an infant stirring in the womb about to mature." After reading or hearing this thorough analysis and vivid explanation of the domestic and international situation at that time, who could not be refreshed and full of confidence? The most obvious example of the latter is that in the spring of 1949, when the overall situation of the national revolutionary victory had been decided, and when the emotions of arrogance, complacency, and enjoyment might easily breed among party members and cadres, the "Resolution of the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party" timely pointed out that "winning the victory throughout the country is only the first step in completing the Long March." This metaphor in the resolution of the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party penetrated the minds of cadres at all levels of the Party. It played the role of a "vaccine" in preventing the complacency and enjoyment that might grow within the Party due to the victory of the revolution.

We can find examples of using the method of "comparison" to understand and explain problems in Chairman Mao's works at any time. Here, in order to save newspaper space, I will not give more examples.

When we use this method of "comparison," there are two points that must be given special attention in order to achieve its due effect:

First, we must distinguish between what is a newborn thing and what is an aging thing; which is the phenomenon of a thing and which is the essence of a thing. The result of the "comparison" (struggle) between the newborn thing (no matter how weak it looks at the beginning or on the surface) and the aging thing (no matter how powerful it looks on the surface) is always that the newborn thing overcomes the aging thing in the end. The entire history of society and nature is a history of the "comparison" (struggle) between newborn things and aging things, and also a history of the newborn things finally "comparing" (defeating) the aging things. As for the importance of distinguishing between the phenomenon and the essence of things, Chairman Mao wrote in the aforementioned article "A Single Spark Can Start a Prairie Fire": "We must look at the essence of things, and regard their phenomena only as guides to the door. Once we enter the door, we must grasp their essence. This is a reliable and scientific method of analysis."

Second, we must have a vigorous enterprising spirit. Otherwise, if we hold a spirit of being willing to be in the middle or even willing to be downstream to "compare," we will never get good results. In terms of work rather than in terms of status and treatment, the kind of thinking of "comparing upward is insufficient, but comparing downward there is surplus" that we often encounter is a typical example of this kind of spirit of being willing to be in the middle.

The use of "comparison" is great indeed. However, only the people under the leadership of the Communist Party can "compare" (use materialist dialectics to understand problems) and dare to "compare."

### 颂“比”

    颂“比”
    刘子久
    从各方面反映的材料看来，“比”是一种大搞群众运动的好方法。这种方法，可以充分地发挥并且显示在共产党领导之下的工人、农民和知识分子，在建设社会主义过程中的冲天干劲、敢想敢说敢作敢为的共产主义风格、旺盛的进取精神、不怕困难的顽强斗志种种高贵的品质。这些品质每一种都是值得我们加以颂扬的。
    在建设社会主义的实践过程中，运用得最广泛最有效的一种群众运动的形式就是社会主义竞赛。竞赛就是“比”。因此，有的时候有些人就干脆叫竞赛为比赛。什么“比先进”“比干劲”“比作风”“比措施”“比产量”“比质量”“比降低成本”“比提高劳动生产率”，等等。在个人或集体之间进行竞赛的时候，挑战应战的条件几乎没有一项没有“比”或者包含“比”的意思在内。在竞赛过程中，群众方面那种力争上游的冲天干劲，如果用群众自己的话来说，那就是：“谁是英雄谁好汉，群英会上比比看。”“谁英雄谁好汉，月底评比来见面。”
    有人要问，为什么工人、农民和知识分子在建设社会主义过程中的干劲那样大，共产主义的风格是那样高，进取精神是那样旺盛，斗志是那样昂扬呢？
    这首先是由于在社会主义制度下的工人、农民和革命的知识分子已经彻底地消灭了人剥削人的资本主义制度，因而，他们的劳动都是为了自己，为了自己的国家，为了自己的子孙后代的幸福而劳动，而不是为了给资本家增加利润而劳动。因此，在他们看来，劳动再也不是可诅咒厌恶卑鄙下贱的事情，而成为最豪迈最光荣的事业。
    其次，是由于他们首先是工人是一种新生的社会力量。而这种新生的社会力量，在马克思列宁主义的指导之下，他们所干的社会主义和共产主义的事业，正以“排山倒海之势，雷霆万钧之力，磅礴于全世界，而葆其美妙之青春”（新民主主义论）。这种新生的社会力量，岂是那种早已“日薄西山，气息奄奄，人命危浅，朝不虑夕”的资本主义势力及其事业所能够比拟和抗衡呢？这种新生的社会力量，在开始的时候，表面上看起来虽然不像旧势力那样庞大，但是它却有着旺盛的生命力，它却是一颗“可以燎原”的“星星之火”。
    再次，是由于这些新生的社会力量有着正确的坚强的共产党的领导。而且这种领导力量的斗争经验日益丰富，马克思列宁主义思想政治水平日益提高，组织力量日益发展扩大。工人、农民和革命知识分子有了这种领导，就好像老虎长了翅膀一样，无敌于天下。
    此外，“比”又是一种很好的认识问题和说明问题的方法，也就是一种很好的思想方法和宣传方法。
    人们对于某一事物的是非曲直，利害得失，往往不能够一下子看清楚，弄明白。但是如果采用“比”的方法，就很容易看清楚，弄明白。语云：“不怕不识货，就怕货比货”“两利相权（比的意思）取其重，两害相权取其轻”都是说明“比”的作用和好处的。毛主席是最善于运用这种“比”的方法去认识问题和说明问题的。大家都知道，在抗日战争中，持久战那个指导并且保证了抗日战争取得最后胜利的唯一正确的战略方针，就是毛主席对于敌我友三个方面的有利条件和不利条件作了具体地比较（分析）之后得出的。毛主席的“论持久战”一书，其中的大部分篇幅都是在对于敌我友三个方面情况的对比中进行论述的。“比”作为一种思想方法来说，在工作或斗争的环境困难的时候，它可以提高人们的胜利信心；在工作或斗争的环境有利的时候，它可以防止或者消除人们的自满情绪。前者的例子，如1930年中国革命处在低潮的时候，有些同志对于当时的革命斗争缺乏胜利的信心，毛主席为了提高同志们对于当时革命斗争的胜利的信心，在“星星之火，可以燎原”那篇文章中，对于当时国际国内的形势，采用“比”的方法作了精辟而有说服力的分析之后，并且在结论中用生动的比喻指出了中国革命高潮快要到来的情景——“它是站在海岸遥望海中已经看得见桅杆尖头了的一只航船，它是立于高山之巅远看东方已见光芒四射喷薄欲出的一轮朝日，它是躁动于母腹中的快要成熟了的一个婴儿。”人们在看了或者听了这种对于当时国内外形势的透彻的分析和生动的说明之后，谁能不精神焕发，信心万倍呢？后者的例子，最明显的是在1949年春，全国革命胜利的大局已定，在党员干部之中很可能滋生骄傲自满的情绪和享乐思想的时候，在“党的七届二中全会的决议”中就及时地指出：“夺取全国的胜利，这只是万里长征走完了第一步。”七届二中全会的决议中的这个比喻，深入于党的各级干部的脑海之中。它对于防止因为革命的胜利党内可能滋长的自满情绪和享乐思想，起了一种“防疫针”的作用。
    用“比”这种方法来认识问题和说明问题的例子，我们在毛主席的著作中随时都可以找到，在此，为了节省报纸的篇幅起见，就不多举了。
    在我们运用“比”这种方法的时候，要想得到它应有的效果，有两点必须特别予以注意：
    第一，必须分清什么是新生的事物和什么是衰老的事物；哪是事物的现象和哪是事物的本质。新生的事物（不管它在开始的时候或者从表面上看起来是多么弱小）与衰老的事物（不管它从表面上看起来是多么强大）“比”（斗争）的结果，最后，总是新生的胜过衰老的。全部社会的和自然的历史，是一部新生的事物和衰老的事物“比”（斗争）的历史，也是一部新生的事物最后“比”（战）胜衰老的事物的历史。至于分清事物的现象与本质的重要性的问题，毛主席在上述“星星之火，可以燎原”一文中，曾经这样写道：“我们看事情必须要看它的实质，而把它的现象只看作入门的向导，一进了门就要抓住它的实质，这才是可靠的科学的分析方法。”
    第二，必须要有旺盛的进取精神。不然，如果抱着一种甘居中游甚至甘居下游的精神去“比”，那就决不会得到好的结果。在工作方面而不是在地位待遇方面，我们常常遇到的那种“比上不足，比下有余”的思想，就是这种甘居中游的思想的典型。
    “比”之为用大也哉，可是只有在共产党领导之下的人民才能够“比”（用唯物辩证法去认识问题）也敢于“比”。
