    You Are Truly A Good Child
    "Is this Chen Baoling's home?" "Yes!" Chen Da Niang, who was sewing clothes, replied in surprise to the stranger who suddenly pushed the door open. Upon hearing Chen Da Niang's answer, the stranger's face immediately lit up with a smile and introduced himself as the person who had lost his wallet a few days ago, and had come specifically to visit Baoling.
    Chen Baoling is a student at the No. 1 Elementary School for Children of Railway Workers in Beijing and is eleven years old this year. One morning, she and her nine-year-old sister, Baoying, were on their way to school when they saw a small leather bag on the ground at the entrance of an alley. When they picked it up, they found it was bulging with money, meal tickets... it seemed like a large sum of money. Baoling didn't even think about taking it out to examine it closely, but hurried to Teacher Wang and handed him the bag. It turned out that there were nearly fifty yuan in the bag, as well as a bus monthly pass and food stamps. After discussion, the teachers estimated that the wallet might have been lost by a worker from a nearby construction site. So, on the one hand, they contacted the police station, and on the other hand, they contacted the construction site. Sure enough, the wallet was accidentally lost by a worker from the construction site after work. When the worker came to the school to retrieve the wallet, he didn't see Baoling and felt very sorry. But he finally found out Baoling's address and came to her door. At this time, he held Baoling's hand and said repeatedly: You are truly a good child, I can't express my gratitude to you.

    你真是个好孩子
    “这是陈宝玲家吗？”“是啊！”正在缝着衣服的陈大娘，吃惊地回答那个突然推门进来的陌生人。陌生人听到陈大娘的回答，顿时笑逐颜开，并自我介绍说自己就是前几天丢失钱包的人，特来探望宝玲。
    陈宝玲是北京铁路职工子弟第一小学的学生，今年十一岁。有一天早晨，她和她九岁的妹妹宝英上学去，走到一条胡同口，突然看到地上有一个小皮包，拣起来一看，里面鼓鼓地装满了钱、饭票……看样子钱的数目很多，宝玲根本没想到拿出来细看，就三步并两步地找到王老师，把皮包交给了他。原来皮包里有将近五十元钱，还有汽车月票、粮票。教员们经过研究，估计钱包可能是附近工地的工人丢的，于是一方面和派出所联系，一面又和工地联系，果然，钱包是工地一位工人下班后不小心丢失的。这位工人到学校取钱包时，没有看见宝玲，心里很遗憾。但他终于打听到宝玲的住址找上门来了。这时，他拉着宝玲的手连连说：你真是个好孩子，我没法说出对你的感谢。（附图片）
