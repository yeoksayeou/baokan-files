　　Black and White Rabbits Not Allowed to Marry
    A Children's Book Enrages Racists

    "Once upon a time, there lived two little rabbits in a large forest. One was white, and the other was black. They often played together.
    'Let's play leapfrog!' said the white rabbit.
    'Ah! Let's... Alas, I wish you were completely mine!' said the black rabbit.
    All the little rabbits came out to see how happy the white rabbit and the black rabbit looked. They danced around the white rabbit and the black rabbit under the moonlight all night long.
    So, the two little rabbits got married and lived happily together in the forest, eating dandelions..."
    This is the text from "The Rabbit's Wedding," the latest work by American children's book author and illustrator Williams.

    A naive and innocent story has stirred up a great uproar in the racially discriminatory American South. Newspapers in Florida have fiercely attacked "The Rabbit's Wedding," saying it has a "brainwashing" effect. Alabama State Representative Adkins even shouted: "Take it off the shelves, burn it!" As a result, "The Rabbit's Wedding" can no longer be seen on the bookshelves of libraries throughout Alabama.

    The author of "The Rabbit's Wedding" made a statement in California saying:
    "I never expected that animals with white fur would have blood relations with the white race. 'The Rabbit's Wedding' is written for children aged two to five. They can understand it. This book is not written for adults. Adults can't understand it because it is a book about tender love, not a book about hatred." (Attached image)

    黑白兔子　不许结褵
    一本小人书激怒了种族主义者
    “从前，在一个大森林里住着两只小兔子。一只是白的、一只是黑的。它们时常在一块玩耍。
    ‘让我们来玩跳马吧！’小白兔说。
    ‘啊！让我们……唉，我真希望你完完全全是我的！’小黑兔说。
    所有的小兔子都跑出来瞧小白兔与小黑兔的那副快乐的样子。它们终夜围绕着小白兔与小黑兔在月光下跳舞。
    于是，两只小兔子就结了婚，快快活活地同住在森林里，吃着蒲公英……”
    这是美国儿童读物作家、插画家威廉斯最新作品“小兔的婚礼”的本文。
    一个天真无邪的故事，在种族歧视狂的美国南方竟引起了轩然大波。佛罗里达州的报纸猛烈抨击“小兔的婚礼”，说它有“洗脑”的作用。亚拉巴马州州议员艾汀斯竟叫嚷说：“把它从书架上拿下来、把它烧掉！”于是，亚拉巴马州各地的图书馆的书架上，再也看不见“小兔的婚礼了。”
    “小兔的婚礼”的作者在加利福尼亚州发表谈话说：
    “我完全没有料想到有着白色皮毛的动物会与白色人种有血缘的关系。‘小兔的婚礼’是为两岁到五岁的儿童写的。他们看得懂。这本书不是为成年人写的。成年人是看不懂的，因为它是一本讲说温柔的爱情、而不是一本讲说仇恨的书。”（附图片）
