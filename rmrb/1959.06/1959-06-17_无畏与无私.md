	Fearlessness and Selflessness
	Zhuang Nong

	An Yemin has great fearless spirit, Xiang Xiuli has great fearless spirit, Xu Xuehui has great fearless spirit... all those who dare to wage an unyielding struggle against the enemy and against difficulties, their great fearless spirit is easily seen. However, does Comrade Wei Jiali, who "pays attention to taking various methods to confide in the masses" (the matter of his confiding was discussed in the article "Heart to Heart," published in this newspaper on June 2nd), also possess a great fearless spirit? This is not so easy to see.

	Of course he does; and he is in no way inferior to others. This is the great fearless spirit of a Communist Party member, as Liu Shaoqi said, "nothing is unspeakable to others."

	Comrade Wei Jiali's great fearless spirit is manifested in two aspects.

	First, he thoroughly confides in the masses. He dares to tell the masses everything he thinks and does in order to gain their supervision. Moreover, when there are shortcomings and errors in his work, he immediately goes to the masses to make a public self-criticism. This matter seems simple, but in reality, it is something that a person who does not truly possess a great fearless spirit would be unwilling and unable to do.

	Writers like to say that people have a "deep soul," and what they are diligently exploring is the mystery of the "spiritual world." In fact, this "soul" and "world" are what we usually call the "heart." To confide in others is to open up one's "deep soul" and guide others into one's "spiritual world," just as we welcome health inspectors into our rooms and allow them to observe and inspect every corner. If one has any unspeakable "secrets" in their heart, or any filth, they would not dare to open up like this. Moreover, to actively tell the masses all of one's thoughts is, as some people say, "handing over the handle" to the masses, giving them the power to supervise oneself, allowing one only to do good deeds and not to do bad deeds. If one still harbors even a little bit of selfishness, one would not dare to do this.

	Second, he dares to speak the truth to the leadership with great responsibility. Here is an example: Last autumn, the sweet potatoes and peanuts in the fields were ripe, and the masses were eager to seize the opportunity to get the fruits of a year's production. However, at this time, two-thirds of the team's labor force was transferred to the commune and county. The masses were very dissatisfied with this, their work was passive, and labor efficiency was very low. When Wei Jiali discovered this problem, he immediately went to the commune Party committee to raise his opinions and suggestions. When the commune Party committee did not solve the problem, he immediately reported it to the county Party committee, which resulted in some losses being avoided in the autumn harvest.

	This matter also seems simple, but in reality, it takes great courage to do it. Only with unlimited loyalty to the Party and the people, and without regard for personal gains or losses (such as not being afraid of others saying that one is conservative), can one speak one's true feelings to the Party and reflect the true situation among the masses in any situation.

	In this way, we will see very clearly that the great fearless spirit is not something that is born. Only those who have a spirit of great public-mindedness and selflessness can have a great fearless spirit. Comrade Liu Shaoqi once pointed out that there are such people in our Party, he said: "If a party member has only the interests and goals of the Party's communism in his ideological consciousness, and has no personal goals and private plans separate from the Party, if he is truly selfless, then... he may also have the greatest courage. Because he has no selfishness, he has not done anything 'conscience-stricken,' his errors and shortcomings can be publicly corrected by himself, like 'eclipses of the sun and moon.' He is 'justified and confident,' never afraid of the truth, bravely supports the truth, tells others the truth, and fights for the truth. Even if doing so is temporarily unfavorable to him, and he has to endure various blows and even be opposed and accused by the majority of people and be temporarily isolated (glorious isolation) in order to maintain the truth, and even if he has to sacrifice his own life because of this, he can still uphold the truth against the tide and never drift with the tide. Because for him personally, he has nothing to fear." (On the Self-Cultivation of Communists)

	I believe that Comrade Wei Jiali is such a person. He completely trusts the Party and completely trusts the masses; he firmly listens to the Party and firmly listens to the masses. Therefore, he is both a good comrade and a good cadre of the Party, and a good friend and a good leader of the masses; he has gained the complete trust of the Party and the complete trust of the masses; he has been praised by the Party and enthusiastically praised by the masses. This makes us excited and moved, and also makes us see most clearly that, fundamentally speaking, the interests of our Party and the interests of the masses are always completely consistent. Comrades, please remember: when you see the interests of the masses being harmed, it is precisely the interests of our Party that are being harmed. We must use a great fearless spirit to defend it, and defending the interests of the masses is defending the Party.

	Therefore, we should carry forward this great fearless spirit, this absolute loyalty to the Party and the masses. We must advocate completely confiding in the masses and completely telling the truth to the Party. We should not retain even a trace of selfishness towards the Party and the masses, nor should we tell even a trace of falsehood. People should use the respect for the brave and the love for the loyal to welcome everyone who tells the truth.

### 无畏与无私

    无畏与无私
    庄农
    安业民有大无畏精神，向秀丽有大无畏精神，徐学惠有大无畏精神……，所有敢于向敌人，向困难作不屈不挠斗争的人，他们的大无畏精神，都容易被人看清楚。可是，那个“注意采取各种办法向群众交心”的魏家理同志（他交心的事，在6月2日本报发表的“心心相印”一文里曾经谈到过），是不是也有大无畏精神呢？就不容易看清楚。
    当然有的；而且比他人一点也不逊色。这就是刘少奇同志所说，共产党人“无事不可对人言”的大无畏精神。
    魏家理同志的大无畏精神，表现在两个方面。
    第一，他彻底向群众交心。敢于把自己想些什么，干些什么统统都告诉群众，以取得群众的监督。而且，在工作上有了缺点和错误，就马上去向群众公开检讨。这件事看起来简单，其实，如果不是真正具有大无畏精神的人，是不肯作也作不来的。
    文学家喜欢说人有“灵魂深处”，他们辛勤探察的正是人的“精神世界”的奥秘。其实，这“灵魂”和“世界”也就是我们通常所说的这个“心”。交心，就是把自己的“灵魂深处”亮开来，引导别人进入自己的“精神世界”里，就像我们欢迎检查卫生的人进入我们的房间，任他们在各个角落里观察检验。如果，他内心存有什么见不得人的“奥秘”的话，或者是有什么污垢的话，他是不敢这样亮开来的。何况，主动把自己的所有想法去告诉群众，这正像一些人所说的是“授柄于人”，把权力交给了群众，让他们监督自己，只许办好事，不许办坏事。如果他还存有半点私心，便会不顾也不敢这样作。
    第二，他敢于非常负责地向领导上说真话。这里有一个例子：去年秋末，地里的地瓜、花生都成熟了，群众迫切要求不失时机地把一年生产的果实拿到手。但是，正当这个时候，队里三分之二的劳动力，都上调到公社和县里去了。群众对这非常不满，干活消极，劳动效率很低。魏家理发现这个问题，便马上到公社党委提出了意见和建议，公社党委没有解决了这个问题，他又马上向县委作了反映，结果使秋收免受了一些损失。
    这件事，也是看起来简单，实际上要有很大的勇气，才能作到的。只有对党对人民是有无限忠心，丝毫也不计较个人得失（比如不怕别人说自己保守），才能在任何情况下都这样披肝沥胆地向党说真心话，反映群众中的真实情况。
    这样我们便会看得很明白，大无畏精神并不是什么天生的东西。只有具有大公无私精神的人，才可能有大无畏精神。刘少奇同志曾经指出过我们党内有这样一种人，他说：“党员如果在他的思想意识中只有党的共产主义的利益和目的，没有自己离党而独立的个人目的和私人打算，
    他真正大公无私，那末……他也可能有最大的勇敢。因为他没有任何私心，他没有作过‘亏心事’，他的错误缺点能够自己公开，勇敢改正，有如‘日月之蚀’。他‘理直气壮’，永远不怕真理，勇敢地拥护真理，告诉别人以真理，为真理而战斗。即使他这样作暂时于他不利，为了维护真理而要受到各种打击，甚至受到大多数人的反对与指责而使他暂时孤立（光荣的孤立），甚至因此而要牺牲自己的生命，他也能够逆潮流而拥护真理，绝不随波逐流。因为对于他个人来说，他无所畏惧。”（论共产党员的修养）
    我以为魏家理同志正是这种人。他既完全信任党，又完全信任群众；既坚决听党的话，又坚决听群众的话。因此，他既是党的一个好同志，好干部，又是群众的一个好朋友，好领导者；他取得了党的完全信任，也取得了群众的完全信任；他既受到了党的表扬，也得到群众的热烈称赞。这使我们兴奋而激动，也使我们最清楚不过地看出：从根本上说，我们党的利益和群众的利益，永远都是完全一致的。同志们千万要记住：当你看到群众利益受到损害的时候，那正是我们党的利益在遭受损害。必须用大无畏的精神去捍卫它，捍卫群众的利益就是捍卫党。
    因此，我们应该发扬这种大无畏精神，这种对党对群众的耿耿忠心。我们要提倡对群众完全交心，对党完全说真话。对党对群众不应该保留一丝一毫私心，也不应说一丝一毫假话。人们要用对于大勇者的尊敬，对于忠心者的热爱，来迎接每一个说真话的人。
