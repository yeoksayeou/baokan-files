    The Great Poet of the Russian People
    —Commemorating the 160th Anniversary of Pushkin's Birth
    Candidate of Philosophical Sciences, Fu Puchintsev

    The name of the brilliant poet Alexander Sergeyevich Pushkin constitutes the pride and glory of Russia. The poet's works reflect the people's aspirations for freedom and the heroic struggle of the progressive circles of Russian society at that time against the brutal autocratic system within the country. Pushkin is the founder of realistic literature and the creator of the Russian literary language.
    The poet was born on June 6, 1799, into a noble family in Moscow. Even in his childhood, he developed an interest in literature, especially Russian folk poetry. From 1811 to 1817, while studying at the Tsarskoye Selo Lyceum near St. Petersburg, his first attempts at poetry attracted the attention of his classmates and teachers. At that time, some of Pushkin's unsigned poems began to appear in newspapers and magazines, and "Memories of Tsarskoye Selo," which was praised by the great Russian poet Derzhavin of the 18th century, was published in one of these magazines.
    Pushkin entered the literary scene during a great upsurge of Russian social movements. As Herzen later described, the events of the victorious Patriotic War of 1812 "strongly awakened the patriotic feelings within the people." Among the progressive elements of the nobility, anti-government sentiments also arose. Secret gatherings and associations of future Decembrists emerged across the country. Pushkin enthusiastically embraced the freedom-loving political ideas that swept through the progressive youth of the nobility. After graduating from the Lyceum, the poet's literary reputation grew rapidly, especially due to the appearance of the poem "Ruslan and Lyudmila." The poet Pushkin's freedom-loving poems, short songs such as "Freedom," "The Village," and other poems permeated with folk sentiment and calling for the struggle against tyranny, autocracy, and serfdom, attracted the attention of the Tsarist government. The poet was threatened with exile to Siberia, and only through the intercession of influential friends did he receive a lighter punishment: in the spring of 1820, Pushkin was exiled to the south of Russia.
    The years of the poet's exile in the south (1820-1824) were of great significance for the further development of his thought and art. Whether in the Caucasus or Crimea, in Kishinev or Odessa, Pushkin closely approached Russian reality, met with participants in the Southern Secret Society of the Decembrists, and passionately responded to all events in the domestic and Western European political life. The poet used all his creations to praise and support the political ideas of the Decembrists—noble revolutionaries—in Russian society. In December 1825, the Decembrists launched the first armed uprising against Tsarist autocracy in Russia.
    In addition to writing many folk and lyrical poems in the south, Pushkin also wrote the romantic poems "The Prisoner of the Caucasus," "The Robber Brothers," and "The Fountain of Bakhchisarai." During these years, he began the narrative poem "The Gypsies" and the famous novel in verse "Eugene Onegin," for which he worked for more than eight years.
    In the summer of 1824, according to the Tsar's instructions, Pushkin was sent to a new place of exile—the village of Mikhailovskoye (Pskov Governorate), placed under the supervision of the local authorities. During these years, direct contact with the lives of the Russian people had a great influence on the development of Pushkin's work. The poet carefully studied the lives of ordinary people, collected and recorded typical creations of folk poetry, and then creatively applied them to his own works.
    The years of life in Mikhailovskoye are recorded in Pushkin's biography as the beginning of realism in his poems. According to his own statement, Pushkin became a "poet of real life." The romantic images of his southern poems were replaced by realistic scenes of Russian life and broad generalizations of real life. The most interesting in this respect is the poem "The Gypsies," completed in Mikhailovskoye, which reveals the romantic worship of the solitary protagonist. Pushkin continued to work on "Eugene Onegin" and wrote the unparalleled folk tragedy "Boris Godunov," which marked a new stage in the development of Russian historical drama. This tragedy depicts with unparalleled vividness the great role of the people in historical events.
    Pushkin learned of the uprising in Senate Square in St. Petersburg on December 14, 1825, and the brutal suppression of the Decembrists by Nicholas I while in Mikhailovskoye. This news shocked him greatly, but he remained faithful to the ideas of the Decembrists. During the difficult years of rampant reaction, in many poems such as "To Siberia," "Arion," "December 19th," and other poems, the poet bravely praised the achievements of the insurgents, acknowledging that unbreakable ties linked him to them and expressing his firm belief that their cause would triumph. In the autumn of 1826, Pushkin returned to Moscow from exile but remained under secret police surveillance. Tsar Nicholas I declared himself to be the censor of his works. Despite the difficult circumstances in which the poet found himself, an unprecedented flourishing and a moment of complete maturity appeared in his creations. There was not a single literary field in which Pushkin did not leave behind outstanding works that are universally recognized as masterpieces of artistic creation during the last ten years of his life.
    In 1830, Pushkin completed the novel in verse "Eugene Onegin," which the great Russian critic Belinsky correctly called "an encyclopedia of Russian life." In this great realistic work, the poet extensively depicted various aspects of life in Russian society, giving a vivid satirical portrayal of the life and customs of the nobility. In the history of Russian literature, "Eugene Onegin" occupies a glorious position, just as the works of Lermontov, Goncharov, Turgenev, Leo Tolstoy, and other great Russian writers, which laid the foundation for the flourishing of realistic novels.
    At the same time, Pushkin also wrote a large number of poems, fairy tales, and novels in verse in different styles, including the historical poem "Poltava," which is permeated with ardent patriotic passion. This poem creates the heroic image of Peter the Great I and expresses the greatness and fearlessness of the Russian people in defeating the invaders. The poem "The Bronze Horseman," which took years to write, echoes "Poltava" in many ways. Here, the theme of Peter the Great I and his transformations is connected with the theme of the "fate of the little man."
    During these years, Pushkin created the "Little Tragedies," "The Stone Guest," "Mozart and Salieri," and other works, wrote prose, and created the simple, rigorous, and concise "Tales of Belkin" and "The History of the Village of Goryukhino," all of which have sharp anti-serfdom tendencies. He also wrote the novella "Dubrovsky," "The Queen of Spades," and the historically significant novel "The Captain's Daughter," which deals with the Pugachev Rebellion. Pushkin's prose played an outstanding role in the further development of Russian literature along the path of realism and populism.
    When the poet was filled with new and inspiring intentions and was experiencing the golden age of his creative power, his life came to a tragic and sudden end. A shameless court intrigue led the great poet to duel with D'Anthès, a French officer serving in Russia. Pushkin was fatally wounded in the duel and passed away on February 10, 1837.
    Pushkin's immortal legacy has world-historical significance. Today, all progressive mankind joins the Soviet people in commemorating the 160th anniversary of the birth of the great Russian poet, humanist, brilliant artist, and passionate defender of freedom.

    俄罗斯人民的伟大诗人
    ——纪念普希金诞生一百六十周年
    哲学副博士　弗·普钦泽夫
    天才的诗人亚历山大·谢尔格耶维奇·普希金的名字构成了俄罗斯的骄傲与光荣。诗人的创作反映了人民对自由的热望，反映了当时俄罗斯社会进步界反对国内残暴的独裁制度的英勇斗争。普希金是现实主义文学的鼻祖、俄罗斯文学语言的创造者。
    1799年6月6日，诗人诞生在莫斯科的一个贵族家庭里。还在童年的时候，他就对文学，特别是俄罗斯民间诗歌发生了兴趣。1811年至1817年，普希金在彼得堡附近沙皇村中学念书的时候，他的第一批诗作的尝试便引起了皇村中学同学和老师的重视。当时普希金的一些未署名的诗篇开始在报刊上出现，而受到十八世纪俄罗斯伟大诗人杰尔札文赞赏的“皇村的回忆”就是发表在一种杂志上的。
    在俄罗斯社会运动伟大的高潮年代，普希金登上了文坛。正如后来赫尔岑所描写的那样，1812年胜利的卫国战争事件“强烈地唤起了人民内心的热爱祖国的感情”。而在贵族的进步分子中，也产生了反对政府的情绪。全国相继出现了未来十二月党人的秘密集会结社。普希金热情地接受了席卷贵族进步青年的爱好自由的政治思想。中学毕业以后，诗人的文学荣誉日益迅速增长，特别是由于“鲁斯兰和柳德米拉”诗篇的出现，诗人普希金的爱好自由的诗篇，短歌“自由”、“乡村”和其他渗透民间情调、号召为反对暴政、专横和农奴制而斗争的诗篇，引起了沙皇政府的注意。诗人受到流放西伯利亚的威胁，只是由于有声望的朋友的说情，才受到比较轻的惩罚：1820年春，普希金被流放到俄罗斯的南方去了。
    诗人南方流放的年代（1820—1824年），对于他思想和艺术的进一步发展具有重大的意义。无论是在高加索或克里米亚，在基希?夫或敖德萨，普希金紧紧地接近了俄罗斯的现实，会见了十二月党人南方秘密协会的参加者，激情地响应了国内和西欧的一切政治生活的事件。诗人用自己全部的创作来歌颂和赞助俄罗斯社会中十二月党人——贵族革命者的政治思想。1825年12月，十二月党人在俄国第一次掀起了反对沙皇专制的武装起义。
    普希金在南方除写出了许多民间的和抒情的诗篇以外，还写出了浪漫主义的诗篇“高加索的囚徒”，
  “绿林弟兄”、“巴赫契沙拉依的泪泉”。在这些年代里，他开始了“茨冈”叙事诗和著名的诗体小说“叶甫盖尼·奥?金”的创作，为了这部创作他工作了八年多的时间。
    1824年夏，根据沙皇的指令，普希金被送到新的流放地——米哈依洛夫斯克村（普斯柯夫斯克县），置于地方政权的监督之下。在这些年代里，跟俄罗斯人民生活的直接接触对普希金创作的发展给予了巨大的影响。诗人悉心地研究了普通人的生活，收集和记录民间诗的典型性创作，然后创造性地运用到自己的作品中去。
    米哈依洛夫斯克村生活的年代，作为他的诗篇中现实主义的开端已确定下来的年代而记入普希金的传记里。根据他本人的说法，普希金成了“现实生活的诗人”。他的南方诗篇的浪漫主义形象被俄罗斯生活的现实主义情景，现实生活的广泛的概括所代替了。在这方面最令人感到兴趣的是在米哈依洛夫斯克村完成的诗作“茨冈”，在这部诗作里揭示了独身主人公的浪漫主义的崇拜。普希金继续创作“叶甫盖尼·奥?金”，并且写出了无与伦比的民间悲剧“波利斯·戈都诺夫”，这部悲剧标志着发展俄罗斯历史剧的新阶段。这部悲剧以无比鲜明的笔调描绘出人民在历史事件中的伟大作用。
    普希金在米哈依洛夫斯克村得知1825年12月14日彼得堡元老院广场的起义和尼古拉一世对十二月党人的残酷镇压的消息。这个消息使他极为震惊，可是他仍然忠实于十二月党人的思想。在反动派猖狂的艰难岁月里，诗人在许多诗笺里“致西伯利亚”、“阿利盎”、“十二月十九日”和其他的诗作中勇敢地讴歌赞美起义者的功勋，承认自己与他们之间维系着千万根牢不可破的纽带，并且深信他们的事业必将胜利。1826年秋普希金从流放地回到了莫斯科，但仍置于警察的秘密监视之下。沙皇尼古拉一世自称是他的作品的检查官。尽管诗人所处的环境是如此困难，而在他的创作中却出现了空前繁荣和完全成熟的黄金时刻。没有一个文学部门普希金在自己生命的最后的十年间是没有留下公认为是艺术创造杰作的卓越作品的。
    1830年，普希金完成了诗体小说“叶甫盖尼·奥?金”，伟大的俄罗斯批评家柏林斯基正确地把这部小说叫做“俄罗斯生活的百科全书”。诗人在这部伟大的现实主义作品里多方面广泛地刻划了俄罗斯社会的生活，对贵族的生活与习气给予了鲜明的讽刺性描绘。在俄罗斯文学史中，“叶甫盖尼·奥?金”像给现实主义小说的繁荣奠定了基础的莱蒙托夫、冈察洛夫、屠格?夫、列夫·托尔斯泰和其他伟大的俄罗斯作家创作中的作品一样，占有光荣的地位。
    同时，普希金还写了大量不同风格的诗歌、童话、诗体小说，其中包括渗透着热烈的爱国主义激情的历史诗“波尔塔瓦”。这首诗创造了彼得大帝一世的英雄形象，表现了战胜侵略者的俄罗斯人民的伟大与无畏。花好几年功夫写成的长诗
  “青铜骑士”在许多方面与“波尔塔瓦”相呼应。这里，关于彼得大帝一世和他的变革的主题与有关
  “小人物命运”的主题是互相联系着的。
    在这些年代里，普希金创造了“小悲剧”、“石头客人”、“莫扎尔特与萨莱丽”和其他作品，写过散文，创作了纯朴、严整和简练的“别尔金小说集”、“戈留亨诺村史话”，这些作品都具有尖锐的反农奴制的倾向，还写了中篇小说
  “杜布罗夫斯基”、“黑桃皇后”、具有历史意义的小说普加乔夫起义时代的“上尉的女儿”。普希金的散文在俄罗斯文学沿着现实主义与人民性道路前进的进一步发展中起了卓越的作用。
    当诗人充满新的激奋人心的意图，正在经历自己创造性力量的黄金时代的时候，他的生命悲剧般地突然殒灭了。宫廷无耻的阴谋导致伟大的诗人去同在俄国服务的法国军官丹特斯决斗。普希金在决斗时受了致命伤，于1837年2月10日与世长辞了。
    普希金不朽的遗产具有世界性历史意义。今天，全体进步人类都与苏联人民一道来纪念伟大的俄罗斯诗人、人道主义者、天才的艺术家、自由的热情捍卫者诞生的一百六十周年。
