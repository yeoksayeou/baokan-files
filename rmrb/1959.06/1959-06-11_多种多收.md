Widely implement more variety and more harvest, and at the same time, strive for high-yield production on a portion of the land. This is an urgent requirement in the current summer planting work.

On the basis of the great leap forward in agriculture last year, we have seen an excellent cultivation system that can be gradually realized through long-term continuous efforts—less planting, high yield, and more harvest. The complete implementation of this cultivation system will fundamentally change the backward state of agriculture in our country. That is: concentrating efforts on less land to implement the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture and strive for greater agricultural harvests; allocating a portion of efforts to achieve great development in forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries, just like agriculture; vigorously developing industry and implementing the simultaneous development of industry and agriculture. However, implementing such a cultivation system of less planting, high yield, and more harvest is a long-term plan. Within ten years, this cultivation system cannot be fully implemented or even mostly implemented in our country; it can only be implemented gradually depending on the situation. In the next three years, most areas of our country cannot implement this cultivation system. On the contrary, we should strive for more variety and more harvest.

Why can't we immediately implement this cultivation system of less planting, high yield, and more harvest now? Because it is not yet possible to universally achieve high-yield production. The high-yield production mentioned here does not mean increasing the yield per unit area by 20% or 30% on the basis of three or four hundred catties, but rather increasing it many times over; it does not mean that the yield per unit area of a portion of land is increased many times over, but rather that the yield per unit area of all land is increased many times over; it does not mean that the yield per unit area of several thousand or tens of thousands of acres of land reaches one thousand catties or two thousand catties, but rather that the yield per unit area of hundreds of millions, even billions of acres of land reaches one thousand catties or two thousand catties. After universally reaching two thousand catties, the country will have one billion acres, which can produce two trillion catties of grain annually, with an average of about three thousand catties of grain per person. Only then will it be possible to fully implement the cultivation system of less planting, high yield, and more harvest.

To transform several thousand or tens of thousands of acres of high-yield fields into several million, tens of millions, or hundreds of millions of acres of high-yield fields, we must go through a series of long-term and arduous efforts. To achieve high yield, the land must be cultivated deeper, more fertilizer must be applied, and more water conservancy projects must be built. However, to cultivate hundreds of millions or billions of acres of land deeply, with sufficient fertilizer, timely drought resistance and drainage, and timely disease and pest control, it cannot be done by manpower and animal power alone; it cannot be done with farm manure alone. To achieve this, there must be machinery and equipment such as tractors, a large amount of chemical fertilizer, efficient pesticides, and modern pest control equipment.

At present, our country does not yet possess these conditions, so the yield of agricultural production is very unstable. One year may be a bumper harvest, and the next year may be a poor harvest or even a famine. Under these circumstances, less planting, high yield, and more harvest is not reliably guaranteed, and universally implementing this system is dangerous. This year, the yield per unit area of summer harvest crops in some people's communes has increased significantly, reaching more than 30%, but because the sown area has been reduced more than last year, the total output has not increased much, or has not increased at all. This should be taken as a lesson. Therefore, for a relatively long period, all arable land must be planted to strive for more harvest. To plant more this year, we must seize the current summer sowing season, and strive to plant another season of crops in the wheat stubble fields without affecting autumn wheat planting and green manure planting. After the early rice harvest, we must also strive to plant another season as much as possible. In addition, we must mobilize the vast number of commune members to make use of all vacant and idle land in front and behind houses, along riverbanks and roadsides to plant feed, oil, and grain crops. More variety and more harvest is an urgent problem in current agricultural production. We must seize the opportunity, expand the sown area as much as possible, and take various effective measures to strive for more harvest.

On the other hand, while expanding the sown area, we can and should also strive to achieve high-yield production on some of the land. This is also to prepare for the future full implementation of the cultivation system of less planting, high yield, and more harvest. As for how much land to strive for high-yield production on, it depends on the situation in each region. It can be 30% of the total sown area, or it can be 20% or 10%, or even less. In a commune, if it is not possible to strive for a thousand acres out of ten thousand acres, or two thousand acres out of five thousand acres, strive for high-yield production, for example, to achieve an average yield of one thousand catties per mu. Some people believe that to carry out the thousand-catty-per-mu movement, the movement can only be considered successful if all the land in the entire province and county achieves an average yield of one thousand catties per mu; otherwise, the movement is considered a failure. This view is of course incorrect. Carrying out the thousand-catty-per-mu movement in a province or a county is of course very good if it can strive to make the entire province or county achieve an average yield of one thousand catties per mu, but if this cannot be achieved, striving to make a production team or a commune achieve an average yield of one thousand catties per mu, or to make a few percent, a few ten percent, or a few dozen percent of the land achieve an average yield of one thousand catties per mu, is also a great achievement. This year, thousand-catty teams, thousand-catty communes, and a portion of thousand-catty mu have appeared, and next year and the year after, thousand-catty counties, thousand-catty prefectures, and even thousand-catty provinces may appear. Striving for high-yield production on a portion of arable land, and launching a thousand-catty-per-mu movement for this purpose, to inspire the enthusiasm of the peasant masses, is absolutely necessary.

In order to implement more variety and more harvest, we must attach importance to the use of all scattered land. Vacant and idle land in front and behind houses, along roadsides and riverbanks, seems to be very small in area when viewed from the perspective of scattered three-fen or four-fen plots of land, but when viewed from the perspective of scattered land in a production team, a commune, a county, a prefecture, or a province, it is a very large number. According to statistics from Qingyang County, Gansu Province, as of May 8, the county has already used courtyards, roadsides, field ridges, idle beaches, and other vacant and idle land to plant more than 1,200 mu of daylilies, 4,900 mu of hemp, 8,948 mu of vegetables, 41,672 mu of millet, and 4.32 million nests of melons, with a total area of ​​more than 56,000 mu of vacant and idle land utilized in the county. Can this be said to be small? Three-fen or four-fen plots of land are small compared to the land of a production team or a commune, but they are not small for a family. Especially if these lands are planted with feed, and each family raises one more pig, that would be 120 million pigs nationwide; raising two more pigs would be 240 million pigs nationwide. Can this be said to be small? Therefore, all localities must fully mobilize the masses to maximize the use of all scattered land to plant various crops.

In order to expand the sown area of ​​summer planting as much as possible, labor must be comprehensively arranged. At present, summer harvesting and summer planting, purchasing, grain delivery, and developing sideline production are all squeezed together, and labor is tight. People's communes in all localities must comprehensively arrange labor. During the summer harvesting and summer planting period, the vast majority of labor should be invested in agricultural production. Some factories that do not directly serve agricultural production should not be operated; some factories that directly serve agricultural production but can be temporarily suspended should also be temporarily suspended. Only in this way can labor be concentrated on the agricultural production front. The masses must be mobilized for repeated discussions to first clarify how much agricultural work there is during the summer harvesting and summer planting season, how much labor is needed, and how to use labor, so as to achieve unified opinions from top to bottom. The Chahua People's Commune in Fuyang County, Anhui Province, through multiple discussions, added nearly 10,000 laborers to summer harvesting and summer planting. They suspended or postponed the operation of some commune-run factories and transferred more than 1,000 people to agricultural production. Through the reform of cooking tools and other methods, more than 1,000 laborers were transferred from public canteens, and more than 8,000 auxiliary laborers were organized to participate in the agricultural front. In addition, through the reform of tools and the promotion of mutual assistance and cooperation, the problem of labor shortage in summer harvesting and summer planting in this commune was completely solved. This is an experience worth emulating in all localities.

The task of summer planting is very arduous. According to preliminary plans in various localities, the national summer planting area is over 500 million mu, of which the sown area of ​​grain crops is about 400 million mu, accounting for about one-quarter of this year's grain sown area, and the grain output also accounts for more than one-quarter of the total grain output for the year. Therefore, striving for the victorious completion of the summer planting task is of decisive significance for striving for a bumper harvest this year. The current situation is very good. Many places have convened party representative conferences and commune member representative conferences, which have further mobilized the enthusiasm of commune members and set off a vigorous summer production upsurge. As long as leaders at all levels continue to adopt mass movement leadership methods such as visits, comparisons, and competitions, they will surely be able to lay a solid foundation for striving for a bumper harvest of late rice and late autumn this year.

### 多种多收

    多种多收
    广泛地实行多种多收，同时在一部分土地上争取高额丰产。这是当前夏种工作中的迫切要求。
    在去年农业大跃进的基础上，我们看到了一个经过长时期不断努力可以逐步实现的优良的耕作制度——少种、高产、多收。这个耕作制度的完全实行，将使我国农业的落后状态发生根本的变化，这就是：在较少土地上集中力量实行八字宪法，争取农业更大的丰收；分出一部分力量争取林、牧、副、渔和农业一样获得大发展；大办工业，实行工业和农业同时并举。但是，实行这样一种少种、高产、多收的耕作制度是一个远景计划。在十年以内，这种耕作制度在我国不能全部实行，也不能大部实行，只能看情况逐步实行。在最近三年以内，我国大部分地区不能实行这种耕作制度，相反地，应当力争多种多收。
    为什么现在不能立即实行这个少种、高产、多收的耕作制度呢？因为现在还不可能普遍做到高额丰产。这里所说的高额丰产，不是单位面积产量在三、四百斤的基础上增加20％或30％，而是成倍地增加；不是一部分土地的单位面积产量成倍地增加，而是全部土地的单位面积产量成倍地增加；不是几千亩、几万亩土地的单位面积产量达到一千斤、二千斤，而是几万万，以至十万万亩土地的单位面积产量达到一千斤，二千斤。在普遍达到二千斤以后，全国有十亿亩，就可年产粮食达二万亿斤，每人平均约有粮食三千斤。这时少种、高产、多收的耕作制度才有可能全部实行。
    要使几千亩、几万亩高额丰产田，变为几百万亩、几千万亩、几万万亩高额丰产田，就要经过一系列的长期的艰巨的努力。要高产，地就要耕得更深一点，肥料就要施得更多一点，水利工程要建设得更多一点，而要把几万万亩、十万万亩土地耕得深，肥料足，抗旱排涝及时，治病除虫及时，只靠人力、畜力是办不到的，只靠农家肥也是不行的。要做到这样，必须有拖拉机等机械设备，有大量的化学肥料，有效率高的农药和近代化的治虫设备。
    目前我国还没有具备上述的这些条件，因此农业生产的产量是很不稳定的，这一年可能丰收，下一年就可能不丰收甚至歉收。在这种情况下，少种、高产、多收是没有可靠的保证的，普遍实行这种制度是危险的。今年有的地方有些人民公社的夏收作物的单位面积产量虽然提高得不少，达到30％以上，但是因为播种面积比去年减少较多，结果，总产量增加不多，或者没有增加。这是应当引为教训的。因此，在一个较长的时期内，还必须把一切可耕种的地都种上，争取多收。今年要多种，就要抓住当前的夏季播种季节，要在不影响秋季种麦、不影响种绿肥的条件下，力争在麦茬地里再种上一季庄稼。在早稻收割以后，也要争取尽可能地再种一季。此外，还要动员广大社员，把屋前屋后、河边路边一切空地闲地都利用起来，种上饲料、油料和粮食作物。多种多收是当前农业生产中的急迫问题，必须抓紧时机，尽可能地扩大播种面积，并且采取各种有效措施，力争多收。
    另一方面，在扩大播种面积的同时，可以也应当争取在部分土地上实现高额丰产。这也就是为将来全部实行少种、高产、多收的耕作制度作好准备。至于争取多少地高额丰产呢？这要看各地情况而定。可以是播种总面积的30％，也可以是20％或10％，甚至更少一点。在一个公社来说，不能万亩就搞千亩，不能五千亩就搞二千亩，力争高额丰产，比方说达到平均亩产千斤。有人认为，开展千斤亩运动，一定要全省全县的全部土地实现了平均亩产千斤，运动才算成功；否则，运动就算失败。这种看法当然是不对的。在一个省、一个县内开展千斤亩运动，能够争取全省、全县作好亩产千斤当然很好，但是如果做不到这点，争取一个生产队、一个公社平均亩产千斤，或者百分之几、百分之十几、百分之几十的土地实现平均亩产千斤，也是很大的成绩。今年出现千斤队、千斤社、一部分千斤亩，明年、后年就可能出现千斤县、千斤专区，以至千斤省。争取部分耕地高额丰产，为此而展开千斤亩运动，把农民群众的干劲鼓舞起来，是完全必要的。
    为了贯彻执行多种多收，必须重视利用一切零星土地。屋前屋后、路边河边空地闲地，从分散的三分、四分土地来看，似乎面积很小，但是从一个生产队、一个公社、一个县、一个专区、一个省的零星土地来看，就是一个很大的数目。据甘肃庆阳县截至5月8日的统计，全县已经利用庭院、路旁、地埂、闲滩等空地、闲地，共种植黄花一千二百多亩，大麻四千九百亩，蔬菜八千九百四十八亩，糜谷四万一千六百七十二亩，瓜类四千三百二十万窝，全县共利用空闲地面积达五万六千多亩。这能说小吗？三分四分地，同一个生产队、一个公社的土地比较，是小，但是对一个家庭来说，就不小。特别是在这些土地上种上饲料，每个家庭多喂一口猪，全国就是一亿二千万头，多喂两口猪，全国就是二亿四千万头。这能说少吗？因此，各地必须充分发动群众，最大限度地充分利用一切零星土地，种植各种作物。
    为了尽可能地扩大夏种的播种面积，必须全面安排劳动力。目前夏收夏种、征购、送粮、发展副业生产等工作挤在一起，劳动力是紧张的。各地人民公社必须全面安排劳力。在夏收夏种期间，应当把绝大部分劳动力，都投到农业生产中去。一部分不直接为农业生产服务的工厂，应该不办；一部分虽然直接为农业生产服务的工厂，暂时可以停办的也要暂时停办。只有这样，才可以把劳动力集中到农业生产战线上去。必须发动群众反复讨论，首先弄清楚夏种夏收时期究竟有多少农活，究竟要多少劳力，究竟怎样使用劳力，求得上下意见一致。安徽阜阳县插花人民公社，经过多次座谈讨论，就给夏收、夏种增加了近万个劳动力。他们停办缓办一部分社办工厂，就抽调了一千多人到农业生产中去，通过炊事工具改革等办法，从公共食堂中调换了一千多个劳动力，组织了一千个左右饲养员参加夏收夏种，又动员组织了八千多个辅助劳力投入农业战线，再加上改革工具、发扬互助协作，这个公社夏收夏种中的劳动力不足问题就完全解决了。这是值得各地效法的经验。
    夏种的任务是十分艰巨的，据各地初步计划，全国夏种面积在五亿亩以上，其中粮食作物播种面积有四亿亩左右，约占今年粮食播种面积的四分之一，粮食产量也占全年粮食总产量四分之一以上。因此，努力争取夏季播种任务的胜利完成，对争取今年大丰收有着决定性的意义。目前的形势是很好的，许多地方召开了党员代表大会和社员代表大会，进一步调动了社员的积极性，掀起了轰轰烈烈的夏季生产高潮。只要各级领导继续采取参观、评比竞赛等群众运动领导方法，就一定能够为争取今年晚稻、晚秋的大丰收打下巩固的基础。
