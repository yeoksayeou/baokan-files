"Preparedness prevents calamities" is an ideology of prioritizing prevention and maintaining initiative. All endeavors must be conducted with initiative, and managing modern production enterprises especially requires thorough preparation.

Modern production means using machinery for production. It means using machines to replace human hands, and using electricity, gas, and other sources to replace humans and livestock as power. In modern enterprises, implementing the ideology of "preparedness prevents calamities" and maintaining and repairing mechanical equipment is a specialized and important task. This is because accidents involving mechanical equipment immediately affect the quantity and quality of production, and the impact is even greater in continuous-production integrated enterprises. An accident in one department's equipment will affect a chain of links. At best, it reduces production; at worst, it shuts down the entire line. Therefore, modern enterprises' rules and regulations specifically stipulate maintenance and repair systems for mechanical equipment, and important large enterprises even have dedicated repair engineers. The purpose is preparedness and ensuring the normal production of the enterprise.

Perhaps some believe that since we are having a Great Leap Forward, the maintenance and repair of equipment can be done carelessly, or even ignored. Perhaps some feel that repairing equipment will hinder production, so let's just push through. Such views are, of course, incorrect. Even the finest dapple-red horse, capable of traveling a thousand miles a day, cannot run non-stop all year round. A person, as strong as a Hercules, must also rest after overexertion. Mechanical equipment is no exception; it must be regularly inspected and repaired, just as a person needs a check-up after a certain period. As for some equipment temporarily stopping production for repairs, this is a normal phenomenon. If we wait until the mechanical equipment has major problems before repairing it, that is abnormal. It's like seeing lightning in the sky while on a journey but ignoring it, and then getting drenched when a downpour suddenly arrives. Trying to find an umbrella at that point is like being a drowned rat.

Some enterprises have relaxed the maintenance and repair of mechanical equipment during the rush to increase production. This situation is not normal. The Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company's organization of a "Blast Furnace Health Check-up Team" is a timely and effective way to change this situation. After the check-up, repair projects were proposed, component manufacturing was organized, equipment maintenance systems were established, and accident-free repairs were implemented. In this way, the "health" of the blast furnace is guaranteed.

Continuously maintaining high morale is an indispensable condition for an army to achieve victory; this principle goes without saying. But in an offensive, one must be based on a reliable position before one can advance deep, defeat the enemy, and achieve victory. Similarly, if mechanical equipment is "healthy" across the board and the production base is as solid as a rock, then continuing the Great Leap Forward is greatly assured. Therefore, preparedness, strengthening equipment maintenance and repair, and strengthening component production are not insignificant matters that can be dispensed with, but are very important matters.

    未雨绸缪
    陈之衍
    “未雨绸缪”，是一种预防为主、稳操主动的思想。一切事业都必须稳操主动，管理现代化生产企业，尤其要充分做好准备工作。
    所谓现代生产，就是用机械来进行生产。用机械来代替人的双手，用电、煤气等来代替人和牲畜作为动力。在现代企业中，贯彻未雨绸缪的思想，做好机械设备的维护检修，是一项专门的重要工作。因为机械设备一旦出了事故，立刻就会影响生产的数量和质量，而在连续性生产的联合企业中，影响就更大。一个部门的设备出了事故，一连串的环节都要受到连累。小则减少生产，大则全部停产。因此，现代企业的规章制度中特别规定了机械设备的维护检修制度，并在重要的大企业中还设有专责的检修工程师。目的在于未雨绸缪，确保企业的正常生产。
    也许有人认为：既然要大跃进，设备的维护检修就可以马虎些，甚至可以不用过问。也许有人觉得：检修设备会妨碍生产，还是挺一挺吧。这种看法，当然是不正确的。一匹头等的枣骝马，纵能日行千里，但总不可能一年四季都不停地奔驰。一个人，健壮得像一个大力士，劳累过度，也要躺下来。机械设备也不例外，必须定期检修，就像人经过一定时间，也要检查检查身体一样。至于因为检修，某些设备暂时停止生产，这是正常的现象。如果一定要等到机械设备出了大乱子，再去检修，那就不正常了。就好像人在途中虽然看到空中有闪电，但仍然置若罔闻，结果倾盆大雨从天而降，这时再去找雨伞，已经淋得像落汤鸡了。
    有一些企业在突击生产时，放松了机械设备的维护和检修。这种状况是不正常的。马鞍山钢铁公司组织“高炉健康普查队”的做法，是改变这种状况的一种及时的有效的方法。经过普查，提出了检修项目，组织了配件制造，建立了设备维修制度，实行无事故检修，这样，高炉的“健康”就有保证了。
    不断保持高昂的士气，这是一支军队取得胜利必不可少的条件，这个道理是无须多说的。但在进攻时，一定要立足于可靠的阵地，然后才能长驱直入、克敌致胜。同样地，机械设备台台“健康”，生产阵地固若金汤，继续大跃进就有了重要保证。因此，未雨绸缪，加强设备的维护检修，以及加强配件的生产，并不是一件可有可无的小事情，而是一件十分重要的大事情。
