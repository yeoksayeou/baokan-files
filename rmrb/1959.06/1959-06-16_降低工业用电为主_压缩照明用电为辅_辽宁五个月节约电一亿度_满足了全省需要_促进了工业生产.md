Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 15th - Liaoning Province saved 100.5 million kilowatt-hours of electricity in the first five months of this year, equivalent to the electricity generated by a 30,000-kilowatt power station during the same period. This is the result of Liaoning's implementation of the principle of "mainly reducing industrial electricity consumption, supplemented by compressing lighting electricity consumption." In this way, saving electricity and industrial production are closely linked, which not only saves a lot of electricity, but also promotes production. At present, the province's electricity supply has basically met the needs.

Industrial and mining enterprises in Liaoning Province consume more than 80% of the province's total electricity consumption. Therefore, the potential for saving electricity is mainly in industrial production. The Liaoning Provincial Electricity Department promptly put forward the policy of "mainly saving electricity in industrial and mining enterprises, supplemented by compressing lighting electricity consumption," which enabled the movement to save electricity to be widely carried out in industrial and mining enterprises and closely combined with the enterprise's increase production and practice economy movement. Many key enterprises have set up special organizations to strengthen specific leadership, issue electricity saving targets at the same time as monthly production targets, mobilize the masses to find loopholes, propose measures, and quickly found a specific way to closely combine electricity saving and industrial production. In terms of lighting electricity, all localities have also generally promoted measures such as turning on lights only when it is dark, not turning them on when it is light, not turning them on when not in use, and not turning them on when sleeping.

The experience of Liaoning Province in saving electricity proves that strengthening enterprise management and technical management is the main source of saving electricity, and saving electricity directly promotes the leap forward in production. Therefore, the larger the enterprise and the more in-depth and widespread the technological innovation, the greater the potential for saving electricity. Dalian Steel Plant employees creatively adopted the three-gas steelmaking method of electricity, oxygen, and gas, which reduced the electricity consumption per ton of steel produced by about 100 kilowatt-hours compared to the past. After Benxi Steel Plant adopted "three-gas steelmaking," the time for each furnace of steel was shortened by 30 minutes, production efficiency was increased by 20%, and electricity consumption per ton of steel was reduced by more than 80 kilowatt-hours. Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant, on the basis of promoting the advanced experience of single-slag furnace external forced deoxidation, created a continuous charging and cyclic steel tapping method for electric furnaces, saving 359 kilowatt-hours per ton of steel.

In the electricity saving movement, the workers in various parts of Liaoning Province also found a variety of energy sources, such as using small blast furnace gas to generate electricity, using furnace waste heat to replace electricity, and using small square furnace gas to generate electricity. Their characteristics are that they generally do not require additional fuel and operating personnel, the equipment is simple, the technology is not complicated, and the operation is safe.

    降低工业用电为主  压缩照明用电为辅
    辽宁五个月节约电一亿度
    满足了全省需要　促进了工业生产
    据新华社沈阳15日电　辽宁省今年头五个月节约电力一亿零五百万度，相当于一座三万瓩电站同期的发电量。这是辽宁执行以降低工业用电为主，压缩照明用电为辅的成果。这样，就使节约用电和工业生产紧密地结合起来，既节省了大量电力，又促进了生产。目前，全省电力供应已经基本上满足需要。
    辽宁省工矿企业耗电量占全省用电总数的80％以上。因此，节约用电的潜力主要是在工业生产方面。辽宁省电业主管部门及时提出了“节约工矿企业用电为主，压缩照明用电为辅”的方针，使节约用电运动在工矿企业中广泛展开，并且和企业的增产节约运动紧密结合起来。许多重点企业都专门成立组织机构，加强具体领导，在每月下达生产指标的同时下达节约用电指标，发动群众找漏洞，提措施，很快就找到了节约用电和工业生产紧密结合的具体道路。在照明用电方面，各地也普遍推行了天不黑不点、天亮不点、不用不点、睡觉不点等措施。
    辽宁省节约用电的经验证明，加强企业管理和技术管理，是节约电力的主要源泉，节约用电又直接促进了生产的跃进。因此，企业越大，技术革新开展得越是深入、广泛，节约电力的潜力也越大。大连钢厂职工创造性地采用电气、氧气、煤气三气炼钢法，使每产一吨钢的耗电量比过去降低了一百度左右。本溪钢厂采用“三气炼钢”以后，每炼一炉钢时间缩短三十分钟，生产效率提高20％，每吨钢耗电量降低了八十多度。沈阳重型机器厂在推广单渣炉外强制脱氧先进经验的基础上，创造了电炉连续装料循环出钢法，每吨钢节电三百五十九度。
    辽宁省各地职工在节约用电运动中，还找到了多种多样的能源，例如利用小高炉煤气发电、烘炉余热代电、小方型炉煤气发电等等。它们的特点是，一般不需要增加燃料和操作运行人员，设备简易，技术不复杂，运行安全。
