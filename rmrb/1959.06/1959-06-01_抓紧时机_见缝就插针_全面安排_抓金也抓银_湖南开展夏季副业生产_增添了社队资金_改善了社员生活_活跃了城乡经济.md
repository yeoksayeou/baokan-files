(This article was transmitted by our newspaper's Changsha, May 31st dispatch) Hunan is arranging labor forces comprehensively and developing various sideline productions according to local conditions to increase cash income and make up for the lack of production funds and solve the problem of pocket money for commune members after rice transplanting. In the twenty days of early and mid-May, the cash income from sideline production in various places was more than 46 million yuan, which was more than the income for the entire month of April.

　　"Grasp both gold and silver." This year, while focusing on grain production, people's communes in various places have paid more attention to developing diversified operations. As of May 20 this year, communes across the province had generated more than 250 million yuan in cash from sideline production, averaging more than 200,000 yuan per commune. Generally, communes adopted the method of "more during slack seasons, less during busy seasons," comprehensively planning and uniformly arranging labor. There were more avenues for summer sideline production, and the transplanting work had basically ended, so the number of people arranged to engage in sideline production increased in various places. Some seasonal sideline productions were addressed with labor force blitzes. The Luanshan People's Commune in You County seized the season of honeysuckle (medicinal material) blooming and organized more than 1,000 people to pick more than 5,000 jin in a few days, generating income of more than 700 yuan. The Baitang People's Commune in Xiangyin County, combined with digging sweet potato soil, mobilized women and children to pick wild "Pinellia" (medicinal material) in the soil, picking more than 830 dan in more than ten days, generating income of more than 12,000 yuan. Many places combined the development of sideline production with short-distance transportation, achieving multiple benefits at once. The Xiangtan Special District organized a sideline transportation team of more than 80,000 people and dispatched more than 70,000 local carts to carry out short-distance transportation. In the most recent month or so, the district transported more than 680,000 tons of materials such as grain, steel, and coke. The materials transported in early May increased by 38% compared to the same period in April.

    In developing sideline production, various places put forward the slogan of "relying on the mountains for what the mountains offer, and relying on the water for what the water offers," mobilizing the masses to open up avenues for sideline production. At the same time, according to the principle of "large-scale collective work, small-scale distribution to households," the scope of operations was divided through mass discussions, seizing the opportunity to increase cash income. After discussion among commune members, the Shisun Production Team of the Xinzidu People's Commune in Yiyang handed over ten large-scale sideline industries such as fishing to specialized teams for operation. More than twenty small-scale sideline industries such as splitting chopsticks, making brooms, and making straw sandals were arranged for commune members to do in their spare time, and everyone was very enthusiastic. In April, the team's total income was more than 5,100 yuan. They used this money to buy back 30,000 jin of lime, 40 dan of fertilizer, and 200 jin of pesticides, and added 161 pieces of agricultural implements; they also proposed paying wages of more than 1,300 yuan according to labor work points, and proposed using 1,047 yuan for public canteens to improve the lives of commune members. The Tuanshan Brigade of the Liushahe People's Commune in Ningxiang County had a sideline income of more than 5,960 yuan in the first ten days of May, and they took out more than 3,200 yuan to pay wages for April. After receiving their wages, commune members added summer clothes, small farm tools, and daily necessities, and also saved more than 300 yuan. Commune members had even greater enthusiasm for production. The number of people working in the team increased from more than 900 to more than 1,300, setting off a summer production upsurge, and early rice was generally cultivated and top-dressed.

    In developing sideline production, commercial departments in various places signed purchase and sales contracts with local people's communes to organize purchases in a timely manner, which strongly promoted the development of sideline production. The commercial department of Nan County signed contracts with 105 production brigades of nine people's communes in the county to purchase fresh eggs, specifically helping each commune formulate plans for developing poultry production, so that the number of poultry in the county this year increased by about one time compared to last year. During the fresh egg purchase season, the county's commercial department organized 824 peddlers to visit door to door to exchange goods for eggs and conduct patrol purchases. As of early May this year, more than 770,000 jin of fresh eggs were transferred out, completing the task of transferring fresh eggs 50 days ahead of schedule and exceeding the target by 8.7%.

    抓紧时机——见缝就插针　全面安排——抓金也抓银
    湖南开展夏季副业生产
    增添了社队资金　改善了社员生活　活跃了城乡经济
    本报长沙31日电　湖南各地在水稻插秧后，全面安排劳动力，因地制宜地开展各项副业生产，增加现金收入，以补生产资金之不足和解决社员零花钱的问题。5月上中旬的二十天中，各地搞副业收入现金四千六百多万元，比4月份整个月的收入还多。
      “既抓金，也抓银。”今年各地人民公社在大抓粮食生产的同时，都比较注意开展多种经营。今年到5月20日止，全省各公社已从副业生产中收入现金二亿五千多万元。平均每个公社有二十多万元。一般公社都采取了“农闲多搞，农忙少搞”的办法，全面规划和统一安排了劳动力。夏季副业门路较多，而插秧工作又已基本结束，因此各地安排搞副业的人数增加。有些季节性强的副业生产，各地组织劳动力突击。攸县鸾山人民公社抓住金银花（药材）盛开季节，组织一千多人突击几天就摘回五千多斤，收入七百多元。湘阴县白塘人民公社结合挖红薯土，发动妇女小孩在土里拣野生“半夏”（药材），十多天中拣回八百三十担，收入一万二千多元。许多地方结合开展副业生产，组织短途运输，收到一举数得的效果。湘潭专区组织八万多人的副业运输队，出动七万多辆土车突击短途运输。最近一个多月中，全区运出粮食、钢铁、煤焦等物资六十八万多吨。5月上旬运出的物资较4月份同期增加38％。
    在开展副业生产中，各地提出
  “靠山吃山、靠水吃水”的口号，发动群众广开副业门路。同时根据“大宗集体干，小宗分到户”的原则，通过群众讨论，划分经营范围，抓紧时机，增加现金收入。益阳新市渡人民公社石笋生产队经过社员讨论把捕鱼等十项大宗副业交专业队经营，还有劈筷子、做扫帚、打草鞋等二十多项小宗副业安排给社员利用工余时间去做，大家积极性很高。4月份全队收入五千一百多元。他们拿这笔钱买回三万斤石灰、四十担肥料和二百斤农药，添置了一百六十一件农具；还提出一千三百多元按劳动工分发工资，提出一千零四十七元给公共食堂改善社员生活。宁乡县流沙河人民公社团山大队在5月份头十天中副业收入五千九百六十多元，他们拿出三千二百多元发放4月份工资。社员领到工资后，添置了夏衣、小农具和日用品，还储蓄了三百多元。社员们生产劲头更大了。全队出工人数由原来的九百多人增加到一千三百多人，掀起了夏季生产的高潮，早稻普遍进行了中耕追肥。
    在开展副业生产中，各地商业部门通过与当地人民公社签订购销合同，及时组织收购，有力地推动了副业生产的发展。南县商业部门与全县九个人民公社的一百零五个生产大队签订了收购鲜蛋合同，具体帮助各公社制订发展家禽生产计划，使今年全县家禽较去年约增加一倍。在收购鲜蛋季节，全县商业部门组织八百二十四副货郎担登门串户，以货换蛋，巡回收购。今年到5月上旬止，调出鲜蛋七十七万多斤，提前五十天超额8.7％完成了鲜蛋外调任务。　　　（胡坚）
