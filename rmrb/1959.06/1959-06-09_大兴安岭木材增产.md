Good News from the Deep Mountains and Old Forests
　　Increased Timber Production in the Greater Khingan Mountains
　　The staff and workers of the Greater Khingan Mountains Forest Area in Inner Mongolia, in the movement to increase production and practice economy, have been constantly reporting good news.
　　The Xiniqi Forestry Bureau launched a six-competition campaign to compare good ideology, high output, good quality, good economy, high work efficiency, and good safety. The staff and workers all paid attention to adopting innovative technical methods to strive for the top. The bureau has completed its plan for producing 200,600 cubic meters of timber for the first half of the year more than a month ahead of schedule. The bureau's truck drivers have also promoted train-like and fixed-point operations, greatly improving timber transportation efficiency, and completed the annual plan of transporting more than 31,000 cubic meters of timber on May 12, exceeding the target by 0.29%.
　　The Keyihe Forestry Bureau, which has overfulfilled its plan every month, has promptly repaired roads in all forest farms since the beginning of spring, ensuring the normal transportation of timber and breaking the routine of the timber production off-season. Some forest farms were unable to keep up with the timber transportation needs, so the masses innovated timber collection tools and improved timber collection efficiency.

    深山老林传喜讯
    大兴安岭木材增产
    内蒙古大兴安岭林区职工，在增产节约运动中，不断传出捷报。
    西尼气林业局，开展了比思想好、产量高、质量好、节约好、工作效率高、安全好的六比竞赛。职工们都注意采取革新技术的办法力争上游。全局已提前一个多月完成了上半年生产二十万零六千立方公尺木材的计划。这个局的汽车司机也推行了列车化和定点运行，大大提高了运材效率，5月12日就超额0.29％完成了全年运材三万一千多立方公尺的计划。
    月月超额完成计划的克一河林业局，入春以来，各林场都及时维修了道路，保证了木材正常运出，打破了木材生产淡季的常规。有的林场集材跟不上运材的需要，群众便革新集材工具，提高了集材效率。
