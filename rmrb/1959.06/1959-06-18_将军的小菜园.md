    General's Little Vegetable Garden
    Ma Xingmin Chen Shiji
    One day, Lieutenant General Wu Fushan of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in Guangzhou sent a basket of vegetables to the mess hall. The manager asked with a strange tone: "The chief bought the vegetables but doesn't eat them himself, what are they doing here?" "Comrade Manager, you're mistaken!" the guard said. "These were grown by the chief himself. He just harvested a batch and specially asked me to send some for everyone to eat."
    During the Spring Festival this year, the troops were mobilized to engage in agricultural and sideline production, and Lieutenant General Wu Fushan also received a production assignment. One evening after dinner, he convened a "family meeting" and conducted ideological mobilization. He said: "Last year we planted some peppers and peanuts, that was just something we did casually. This year agricultural and sideline production is a task, so we must do it even better. There are many benefits to doing this: first, we can buy less from the market, second, we can improve our lives, third, we can get exercise through labor, and fourth, we can learn some production knowledge..." The whole family agreed with his opinion. Then, Lieutenant General Wu Fushan led everyone around the housing area, inspecting it once. He planned to utilize every possible piece of land: the weedy areas, under the corners of the walls; at the same time, they discussed what to plant. From that day on, whenever Lieutenant General Wu Fushan had free time, he would lead his family to turn the soil, accumulate fertilizer, and select vegetable seeds. They successively planted more than ten kinds of vegetables such as lettuce, amaranth, peppers, cowpeas, tomatoes, taro, and loofah, and also planted a portion of peanuts.
    Lieutenant General Wu Fushan treated production very seriously. Every morning and evening, he would always go to the vegetable garden to tend to it, watering, fertilizing, weeding, removing pests, loosening the soil, doing everything himself. Others would advise him to rest for a while, but he wouldn't. He often labored while telling everyone stories about opening up wasteland and engaging in production in the past, or studying production methods. He saw in a film that disabled revolutionary soldiers in Sichuan collected cigarette butts and sent them to the people's commune to be used as insecticide, so he also saved cigarette butts to kill insects, and it was indeed very effective. Some time ago, he was going to the troops to serve as a soldier, and before leaving, he instructed his family to fertilize and weed diligently.
    The courtyard where the general lived used to be empty, but now it has become a patch of tender green. The vegetable seedlings are growing vigorously, the cowpeas are more than a foot long, the taro is more than two feet tall, the melon vines are laden with fruit, and the peanut leaves are lush and green. Recently, we went to the general's home on business and happened to arrive during dinner. They were eating mixed cowpeas, fried peppers, and loofah fried with eggs. Except for the eggs, which were bought, everything else was grown by themselves. The general said with a smile: "We are far from being self-sufficient! It's only half self-sufficient." After dinner, he took us to visit the little vegetable garden. As we visited, we listened to him introduce his next production plan. He said: "In the second half of the year, we will focus on planting spinach, red and white radishes, and Chinese cabbage." We walked to a vegetable patch in the corner of the wall, startling a group of chicks that were pecking for insects there. The general told us: "In the second half of the year, the chicks will grow up and lay eggs, and then we can be completely self-sufficient in vegetables. If we buy less or don't buy at all, the masses can eat a little more, and this is also the army's support for the local people."
    The night gradually became hazy. As we left the general's home, looking back at the general's slightly forward-leaning figure, the image of a loyal and devoted old soldier remained in our hearts.

    将军的小菜园
    马醒民　陈世基
    一天，中国人民解放军驻广州部队吴富善中将让警卫员给大伙房送去一筐蔬菜，管理员带着奇异的口气问道：“首长买的菜自己不吃，送到这里来干什么？”“管理员同志，你弄错了！”警卫员说，“这是首长自己种的，刚刚收了一批，特地叫我送一些给大家吃。”
    今年春节，部队动员搞农副业生产，吴富善中将也领受了生产任务。一天晚饭后，他召开了一个“家庭会议”，作了思想动员。他说：“去年我们种了一些辣椒和花生，那是随便搞的一点。今年农副业生产是个任务，所以一定要搞得更好。这样做有很多好处：一可以少到市场去买，二可以改善生活，三可以得到劳动锻炼，四可以学点生产知识……。”一家人都同意他的意见。接着，吴富善中将就领着大家一道在住房周围察看了一遍，杂草地，墙角下，凡是能利用的地都计划利用起来；同时又商量着该种些什么。从那天起，吴富善中将一到业余时间，就领着家里人翻地、积肥、选菜种，先后种上了生菜、苋菜、辣椒、豆角、西红柿、芋头、丝瓜等十多种蔬菜，还种了一部分花生。
    吴富善中将对待生产非常认真。每天早晚，他总要到菜地去拾掇一下，浇水、上肥、除虫、除草、松土，样样都干。别人劝他休息一会儿，他哪里肯呢。他常常是一面劳动，一面和大家讲过去开荒生产的故事或者研究生产方法。他从影片中看到四川革命残废军人拣香烟头送到人民公社作杀虫药用，于是，他也把香烟头留起来杀虫，果然很见效。前些时候，他要下部队当兵去，临走前还交代家人要勤上肥，勤除草。
    将军住的院子过去是空荡荡的，现在变得一片嫩绿。菜苗长的挺茁壮，豆角长的有一尺多长，芋头长的有两尺多高，瓜藤上果实累累，花生叶子绿油油的。最近，我们因事去到将军家里，正碰上吃晚饭。他们吃的拌豆角、炒辣椒、丝瓜炒鸡蛋，除了鸡蛋是买的，其余全是自己种的。将军笑着说：“我们还差的远哩！只是半自给。”饭后，他带我们参观了小菜园。我们一边参观，一边听他介绍下一步的生产计划。他说：“下半年重点种菠菜、红白萝卜和大白菜。”我们走到墙角的一块菜地，惊动了正在那里扒虫子吃的一群小鸡。将军告诉我们：下半年，小鸡长大可以下蛋，菜蔬就可全部自给了。我们不买或少买一点，群众就能多吃到一点，这也是部队对地方的支援。”
    夜色渐渐朦胧了。在离开将军家的时候，回过头去看看将军微向前屈的背影，一个忠心耿耿的老战士的形象留在我们的心间。
