Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, May 31st: Dr. Lothar Bolz, Head of the Government Delegation of the German Democratic Republic and Minister of Foreign Affairs, met with a Xinhua News Agency reporter here today and answered questions raised by the reporter.

Q: Minister, what is your impression of the progress of the Foreign Ministers' Conference to date?

A: The conference has shown some positive aspects so far. The main one is that the issue of concluding a peace treaty with Germany, as suggested by the Soviet Union, is increasingly taking a prominent place in the discussions. We hope that there will be further, more thorough and detailed discussions on all issues related to the conclusion of a treaty. It would greatly help the progress of the conference if the representatives of the Western countries put forward their own suggestions or their own draft treaty to the Soviet draft treaty. All proposals that help to eliminate the danger from West Germany and West Berlin and ease international tensions can be used as a basis for reaching an understanding.

Q: Minister, in your opinion, what are the main obstacles to the success of the conference?

He replied: The discussions so far have made it quite clear that the concepts insisted upon by the Bonn government delegation at the meeting are the main obstacles to serious discussion. The West German government stubbornly opposes all proposals to curb German militarism, end the policy of atomic armament, and pave the way for the peaceful reunification of Germany. They continue to pursue the goal of preparing to implement their aggressive plans through re-militarization and nuclear armament.

Q: Minister, is there a way to establish contact between the two Germanys?

A: We believe that the two German delegations currently in Geneva must hold negotiations together on an equal footing, because the issues being discussed here are of great importance to the German nation. In this way, the two delegations will be able to make the best contribution to the progress of the conference. Our delegation continues to be prepared to participate in such negotiations.

    博尔茨谈日内瓦外长会议的进程
    对德和约问题已居显著地位
    新华社日内瓦5月31日电　德意志民主共和国政府代表团团长、外交部长博尔茨博士今天在这里单独接见了新华社记者，回答了记者提出的问题。
    问：部长先生，您对于外长会议迄今为止的进展情况印象怎样？
    答：目前会议已经呈现出了一些积极的东西。其中主要的是：关于像苏联建议的那样缔结对德和约的问题正在会上越来越占了显著地位。我们希望，就所有同缔结和约有关的问题继续进行更加彻底和详尽的讨论。如果西方国家的代表对苏联的和约草案提出自己的建议，或者自己的和约草案，那将会对会议的进程大有帮助。凡是有助于消除来自西德和西柏林的危险以及缓和国际紧张局势的一切建议都可以用来作为达成谅解的基础。
    问：部长先生，在您看来，什么是妨碍会议取得成功的主要障碍呢？
    他回答说：迄今为止的讨论已经完全清楚地表明，波恩政府代表团在会上所坚持的概念是妨碍进行认真讨论的主要障碍。西德政府对于扼止德国军国主义、结束原子备战政策和替和平统一德国铺平道路的一切建议都一概顽固地加以反对。他们继续追求这样的目标：通过重新军国主义化和核武装来准备实施他们的侵略计划。
    问：部长先生，有办法可以使两个德国之间建立联系吗？
    答：我们认为，目前在日内瓦的两个德国的代表团必须在平等的基础上共同来举行谈判，因为在这里进行讨论的首先是对德意志民族具有重大关系的问题。这样的话，这两个代表团就能够对这次会议的进展作出最好的贡献。我们的代表团继续准备参加这种谈判。
