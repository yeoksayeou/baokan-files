Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, June 14th. While conscientiously organizing the people's economic life, Chongqing is vigorously strengthening ideological and political work on the commercial front.

Because most commercial activities are in grassroots units, and they have the widest contact with the masses, the Chongqing leadership attaches particular importance to the work of grassroots commercial units. The Finance and Trade Department of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China has transferred 57 section-level cadres to work in grassroots units. The Party Committee of the Municipal Bureau of Commerce has also selected a group of Party member cadres from grassroots units who have good connections with the masses and are full of enthusiasm to take on leadership roles at the grassroots level. Party branches have been established in grassroots commercial units that did not have them before, giving full play to the core leading role of the Party branches.

Chongqing has generally established a "small rectification" system from the Finance and Trade Department of the Municipal Committee to the vast number of grassroots units. In the "small rectification," they organize employees to study Chairman Mao's document "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" and related works on finance and economics, combining them with current central tasks to discuss principles, so that commercial employees recognize that commercial work is not only economic work, but also political work and mass work, thereby strengthening their political, production, and mass viewpoints. In early June, the Finance and Trade Department of the Municipal Committee and the Zhong District Committee directly led the convening of a "Five Personnel" representative meeting, with more than 1,700 salespeople, receptionists, barbers, cooks, and savings tellers participating. Representatives from other districts and counties also attended. Through commendations of good deeds and free discussion, the meeting further improved employees' understanding of commercial work, and many employees criticized the erroneous idea of ​​underestimating commercial work.

Recently, Party organizations at all levels in the Chongqing financial and trade system have led employees to carry out competitions, listing support for industrial production, development of suburban non-staple food production, and organization of people's economic life as important content of the competition. Party committees at all levels also systematically summarize the experiences of advanced units and advanced individuals in various industries and trades, and establish models. For example, salesperson Xia Gengfang loves commercial work. In her sales work, she takes care of the lives and production of the masses everywhere. She not only excellently completes her tasks, but also regards commercial work as a political work and mass work, so she is loved by the local masses and has taken root among the masses. At present, commercial employees throughout the city have enthusiastically launched a wave of learning from Xia Gengfang. Zhong District and Beibei District and other districts have produced batches of excellent socialist commercial personnel like Xia Gengfang. (Picture attached)

In some streets far from supply points, Chongqing's commercial departments have entrusted residents to set up service stations (consignment stores, with a certain consignment fee paid monthly) to supply daily necessities, so that the masses can buy what they need locally.

    更好地组织人民经济生活支援工农业生产
    重庆商业系统加强政治工作
    新华社重庆14日电　重庆市在认真组织人民经济生活的同时，大力加强商业战线上的思想政治工作。
    由于多数商业活动都在基层单位，他们联系群众最广，因此，重庆市领导部门特别重视基层商业单位的工作。中共重庆市委财贸部抽调了五十七名科长级干部到基层单位担任工作。市商业局党委也从基层单位中选拔一批联系群众好、干劲足的党员干部，担任基层领导工作。原来没有建立党支部的基层商业单位，建立了党支部，充分发挥党支部的核心领导作用。
    重庆市从市委财贸部到广大基层单位，已普遍建立“小整风”的制度。在“小整风”中，他们组织职工学习毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的文件以及有关财政和经济工作方面的著作，结合当前的中心工作论虚，使商业职工认识到商业工作不仅是经济工作，同时也是政治工作和群众工作，从而加强政治观点、生产观点和群众观点。6月上旬，市委财贸部和市中区区委直接领导召开了“五员”代表会议，有一千七百多名营业员、招待员、理发员、厨师和储蓄员参加。其他各区、县都派了代表参加。会上通过表扬好人好事、鸣放辩论，进一步提高了职工对商业工作的认识，不少职工批判了轻视商业工作的错误思想。
    最近，重庆市财贸系统各级党组织，又领导职工开展竞赛，把支援工业生产、发展郊区副食品生产、组织人民经济生活列为竞赛的重要内容。各级党委还有计划地在各行各业总结先进单位和先进人物的经验，树立标兵。例如售货员夏更芳热爱商业工作，她在售货工作中做到处处关心群众生活和生产，不仅出色地完成任务，还把商业工作当成一项政治工作和群众工作，因而受到当地群众的热爱，在群众中扎了根。目前全市商业职工已经热烈地掀起了学习夏更芳的热潮。市中区和北碚等区已经成批地出现像夏更芳这样优秀的社会主义商业人员。（附图片）
    重庆市商业部门在一些距离供应点较远的街道上，委托居民办起了服务站（代销店，每月给一定的代销费），供应生活日用必需品，使群众就地能购买到自己需要的商品。
