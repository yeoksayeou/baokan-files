Visiting Indonesia
    Xiao Xiangrong
    Long have I cherished memories of Java and yearned for the Wa Island,
    Where my father lived in those years;
    Seeking a branch to perch on,
    After two decades, I return by boat.
    The flames of war burned away monsters,
    The nation's lifeline continues, revealing beautiful branches.
    Green waters and green mountains grow better with each day,
    A bountiful harvest and abundant resources bring joy for the future.

    Welcome Banquet – Three Exquisites
    The welcoming banquet opens in the cool evening,
    Songs and dances follow one after another;
    Applause fills the seats in response,
    Echoes linger in the night sky.
    The Solo River water is calm,
    Plate dances are light and artistic;
    The Ma'luku handkerchief sounds dot by dot,
    Singing friendship songs in unison (Note).
    The Chinese voices sing clearly,
    Especially touching to travelers.
    Don't say Indonesia and China are far,
    Old ties and new friendships grow closer day by day.

    (Note: Solo River is a folk song, Plate Dance is a dance, Ma'luku Handkerchief is a dance from the Ma'luku region, and the chorus song is Jakarta-Beijing).

    Touring Puncak – Two Exquisites
    Roaming Puncak is truly praiseworthy,
    Below are fertile fields, above is tea;
    The climate is cool, and the scenery is beautiful,
    Visitors come from all directions, flourishing day by day.
    A gust of wind brings a gust of sand,
    The mountain scenery is dimly covered;
    A sudden downpour removes the dust,
    And the setting sun shines on colorful homes again.

    Arriving in Bandung
    Long have I admired the illustrious name of Bandung,
    Today, my first visit fills me with excitement.
    The Five Principles build a new edifice for the nation,
    The Ten Principles lay the foundation for great achievements.
    The setting sun of the empire is faint,
    Colonial dragons dance in the eastern sea.
    Soon we will see peaceful coexistence take the lead,
    The universe sings in harmony for a great unity.

      Climbing High to View Bandung
    Climbing high in the evening,
    To view Bandung from all around.
    City stars twinkle,
    Mountains are darkly verdant.
    Cicadas sing a song of understanding,
    A voice transmits the wind of friendship.
    People crowd the road on the way back,
    Waving hands express our subtle feelings.

      Touring the Tea Plantation – Three Exquisites
    Driving a hundred miles to visit the tea plantation,
    The road is still wet from last night's rain;
    Seeing the golden yellow, we know the rice is ripe,
    Each grain on the plate is filled with hardship.
    Climbing the mountain and turning back to the tea plantation,
    As far as the eye can see, thousands of acres are verdant;
    The new fields on the plains greet me with green,
    Roaming beneath the clouds, I feel like a god.
    Just look at the women picking new tea,
    Carrying baskets on their backs, their hands pluck buds;
    They flick handfuls of fragrance behind them,
    Who knows whose home will enjoy the sweet drink.

      Bali – Four Exquisites
    Bali's customs are extremely charming,
    New floating caltrops and seasons on the sea;
    Coconut groves and ripe rice fields everywhere,
    No cold or heat all year round, the evening is cool and clear.
    Bali's songs and dances are extremely charming,
    Young women's beautiful makeup is fresh;
    Eyes frequently convey the meaning of friendship,
    Waists sway naturally and innocently.
    Bali's carvings are extremely charming,
    The gestures are new and artistic;
    Young women do not hide their natural beauty,
    The ancient strength is also transmitted magically.
    Bali's seaside is extremely charming,
    Azure waters and blue skies are the same color;
    At low tide, fishermen gather shells,
    The evening breeze makes everyone drunk and falls asleep.

    At the Presidential Palace
    The Chinese Military Friendship Delegation, accompanied by Ambassador Huang Zhen, bid farewell to Acting President Sartono on May 13th. The Acting President hosted a banquet at the Bogor Palace and requested a commemorative poem. Hence, I compose a poem to record this grand occasion.
    The President invites us to tour the botanical garden,
    The wind is gentle, and the sun is bright.
    Distinguished guests gather in the palace,
    All visitors arrive before the grand hall;
    After viewing the landscape, a grand banquet opens,
    When the music ends, gifts are exchanged to mark the occasion;
    We all vow to protect world peace,
    May our two countries flow together for billions of years.

    Farewell to Jakarta
    As I prepare to pack my bags and return,
    Ten thousand feelings and thoughts are tied to my memory.
    Is it just that the scenery of Southeast Asia is beautiful?
    Even more, it's the nourishment of the host's friendship.
    There is always a road to heaven,
    Monsters have no chance and are becoming less prevalent.
    I only hope that the colors of spring remain every year,
    And that peaceful coexistence increases in glory day by day.

    Before boarding the plane
    As we are about to part ways and board the plane,
    “There is no sorrow greater than parting.”
    Returning to our country, fully laden with kindness,
    Cherishing fervent hopes, I compose a farewell poem.
    There are still stubborn dragons in the waves,
    How can we not share thoughts of weathering storms together?
    May I wish everyone success,
    And may we have a good time to meet again in the future.
                                        May 1959

    访问印度尼西亚
    萧向荣
    怀念爪哇久怀哇岛系萦思，家父当年住此时；聊觅一枝栖息地，历经廿载借船归。烽烟燎绕烧魔怪，国脉绵延启艳枝。绿水青山与日好，年丰物富喜前驰。
    欢迎晚会三绝迎宾佳宴晚凉开，歌舞翩跹逐个来；答谢掌声飞满座，余音萦绕夜空回。梭罗河水不扬波，碟舞轻盈艺色多；麻鹿手巾音点点，齐声合唱友情歌（注）。华声歌唱发音清，客旅听来更动人。莫道印尼中国远，旧缘新谊日相亲。
    （注：梭罗河是一首民歌，碟舞是一种舞蹈，麻鹿手巾是麻鹿古地方的一种舞蹈，合唱曲是雅加达——北京）。
    游本扎二绝漫游本扎喜堪夸，下有良田上有茶；气候清凉风景美，万方来访日繁华。一阵风来一阵沙，满山光景暗被遮；霎时骤下除尘雨，又现微阳照彩家。
    抵万隆久慕英名仰万隆，今朝初访兴冲冲。五基建国开新厦，十项精神奠伟功。帝国西山奄薄日，殖民东海舞蛟龙。行看共处占先胜，寰宇欢声唱大同。
      登高望万隆傍晚登高处，寰区看万隆。市明星点点，山暗绿葱葱。蝉唱知音曲，声传友谊风。归途人拥道，挥手表微衷。
      游茶园三绝驱车百里访茶园，昨夜甘霖路未干；过目金黄知米熟，盘餐粒粒有辛酸。登山回转抵茶园，极目葱茏亩几千；原上新田迎我绿，漫游云底作神仙。且看群女采新茶，背负筐箩手摘芽；把把清香往后甩，那知甘饮又谁家。
      峇厘四绝峇厘风土极媚人，海上浮菱物候新；遍地椰林稻米熟，岁无寒暑晚凉清。峇厘歌舞极媚人，少女靓妆艳色新；眉目频传友谊意，腰肢袅娜自天真。峇厘雕刻极媚人，姿态翻然艺色新；少女不遮天赋美，龙锺古劲亦传神。峇厘海畔极媚人，碧水蓝天一色新；潮落渔人群检贝，晚风普醉万家眠。
    在总统行宫
    中国军事友好代表团在黄镇大使陪同下，于五月十三日向沙多诺代总统辞行，代总统在茂物行宫设宴招待，并嘱赋诗留念。爰赋一律志盛。总统邀游植物园，风和日丽艳阳天。群贤毕集行宫内，众客齐临伟殿前；览罢物华开盛宴，曲终互赠纪婵娟；同声世界和平保，两国长流亿万年。
    告别雅加达又将囊束赋归时，万感千端系我思。岂是南洋风物美，更兼东道友情滋。天庭有路终须到，魑魅无缘已日非。但愿年年春色在，和平共处日增辉。
    上机之前即将分手上机时，“悲莫悲兮生别离”。满载盛情回我国，深怀热望赋骊诗。烟波尚有顽龙在，风雨宁无共济思。愿祝众芳皆顺利，他年重会有佳期。
                     1959年5月
