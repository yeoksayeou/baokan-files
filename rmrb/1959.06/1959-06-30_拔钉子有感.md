Reflections on Pulling Nails
Ge Chaohai

Recently, we participated in voluntary labor at a construction site. Arriving at the site and seeing the inspiring scene of the almost-completed building, everyone was eager to get to work. However, the task assigned to us was to go to the ground section to collect wood and pull nails.

Upon hearing "pull nails," everyone smiled at each other. The implication of the smile was: pulling nails is a small matter, simple and easy. It just felt a little "unsatisfying."

Arriving at the site, we saw piles of old lumber and old planks, covered with crooked, bent, four-inch-long nails, some of which were also covered with layers of solidified cement. Our task was to remove these nails, dig out the cement, and send the wood to the electric saw room to be sawn into thin slices. The electric saw room was the lumber supply station for the building project. The electric saw rotated rapidly, the carpenters worked intensely, and wood flowed in and out like a stream, creating a tense atmosphere. Looking up, we saw a poem on the wall:

	The electric saw spins well and fast,
	Processing wood with high efficiency;
	One nail may seem not much,
	But it can delay things quite a lot.

Reading these verses and seeing this scene, our hearts stirred. It seemed that pulling nails was also relevant to the overall situation. What if the supply couldn't keep up with demand, or if there were "leaks"? At this moment, everyone silently looked at each other, sensing that the situation was somewhat pressing.

Then, everyone started working without regard for anything else. By noon, when everyone tallied the results, they found that although a large pile of wood had been cleared, very little of it was qualified. There were nails that had broken off or were not fully exposed, and hard cement residue remained in the wood cracks. At this time, a worker next to us reminded us: "You have to pay attention! A few days ago, because the nails were not cleaned properly, the electric saw room had seven accidents in one hour, damaging the electric saw and delaying the construction material." Hearing this, and looking at the poem on the wall, everyone felt a little embarrassed.

Fortunately, "failure is the mother of success," and everyone immediately cleaned up the mess and started again. Only then did we realize that this work was not only important but also not as "simple and easy" as originally imagined. There were both procedural and technical requirements. The so-called procedure was to select wood, check for nails, correct the direction of the nails, pull out the nails, clean up residual nails and cement, inspect and accept, and so on. The procedures had to be carried out in order, and not haphazardly, otherwise, we would take detours and affect labor efficiency. As for technical requirements, they were even more obvious. At first, everyone not only didn't know how to avoid breaking nails and embedding them further, but they didn't even know what the tools were for, and just used axes and pliers to knock and pull haphazardly. As a result, the pliers broke, the wood split, and nails flew everywhere, almost causing an accident.

Compared to building that great building, pulling nails may be a small matter, but it is an indispensable part of that great building, and any negligence is enough to affect the progress of the project.

We encountered obstacles, but we learned from them, which may be an unexpected gain.

    拔钉子有感
    葛超海
    最近，我们到一个建筑工地上参加义务劳动。到得工地上，看到那大厦将成的动人景象，大家磨拳擦掌，想立刻大干一番。但是，分配给我们的工作，却是到地面工段去捡木料、拔钉子。
    一听说“拔钉子”，大家相视而笑。这笑的意思不外是：拔钉子么，是小事情，简单易行。只是觉得有些不大“过瘾”似的。
    到现场一瞧，那里到处堆满了旧木方子和旧木板子，上面满都是歪歪斜斜、弯弯曲曲的四寸来长的钉子，有些上面还沾满了一片片、一层层凝固的水泥。我们的任务就是拔掉这些钉子，挖掉这些水泥，把木料送进电锯房，锯成薄薄的木片。而电锯房呢，就是这大楼工程的木料供应站。电锯在飞速地旋转，木工们在紧张地战斗，木料像流水一样拥进又吐出，形成一股紧张气氛。抬头一看，墙上有诗一首：
        电锯如飞转得好，加工木材效率高；
        一个钉子不算多，耽误事情可不少。
    读了这些诗句，看看这般光景，心头为之一动。看来拔钉子也还有关大局。万一供不应求或者出了“漏子”怎么办？这时，大家默默地相互看看，预感到这形势有些逼人了。
    接着，大家不分三七二十一地干了起来。到正午时分，大家清点战果时，才发现木料虽然清理了一大堆，但合格的却很少。木料上漏下了拔断的和不露头的钉子，木缝里残存着硬硬的水泥。这时旁边一位工人提醒说：“你们可得注意呀！前几天因为钉子没有拔干净，电锯房一小时出了七次事故，弄坏了电锯，还耽误了施工用料。”大家听了这话，再看看墙上的诗句，真有些难以为情。
    好在“失败是成功之母”，大家立刻收拾残局，重新干了起来。这时才发现这活儿不但重要，而且也不像原来想像的那么“简单易行”。这里既有个工序问题，又有技术要求问题。所谓工序，就是挑选木料查明钉子、校正钉子方向、拔出钉子、清理残钉和水泥、检查验收，等等。工序要依次进行，不能乱来，否则就会走弯路，影响劳动效率。至于技术要求，就更加明显了。一开始，大家不但不会拔断钉和伏钉，就是连工具也不知干啥用，只是用斧头和钳子乱敲、乱拔一通。结果，钉子钳断了，木料扳裂了，钉子满天飞，差一点出危险。
    比起盖造那个大建筑物来，拔钉子虽是小事，却是那大建筑的不可缺少的部分，它的任何一个疏忽，也足以影响工程的进度。
    碰了钉子，但我们却从中得到了教育，这也许是出乎意料之外的一种收获。
