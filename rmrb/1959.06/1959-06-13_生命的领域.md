    The Realm of Life
    Xiang Yuan

    The Earth is the cradle of life. From the sky to the depths of the earth, from the equator to the poles, countless lives are living and struggling everywhere.

    In the vast blue sky, we can see many birds soaring freely. They generally hover at an altitude of four hundred meters, but some brave ones dare to challenge higher altitudes. Eagles can fly as high as seven thousand meters. On Mount Everest, at an altitude of eight thousand two hundred meters, someone saw mountain crows circling.

    The vanguard of life – microorganisms – can rise with the air currents to the stratosphere more than 20,000 meters high, guarding the foremost outpost of the realm of life. At an altitude of 20,000 to 30,000 meters, there is an ozone layer, which is a protective layer for all life on Earth. Cosmic rays from space that can kill life are absorbed by it. Therefore, the realm of life on Earth can no longer break through this line of defense. However, people can rely on science to send life into restricted areas. On November 3, 1957, the Soviet Union's second artificial satellite went into space, and it contained the dog Laika, which reached a maximum distance of 1,671,000 meters from the ground. The high-altitude explorer who is still alive and well is the dog Albina, who has flown more than 100,000 meters above the ground several times with Soviet high-altitude rockets, and recently gave birth to three puppies, establishing the first cosmic family.

    Below the surface, there are also many lives persisting in underground struggles. The root systems of plants, rodent burrows, insect nests, etc. can extend six to ten meters deep underground. Further down, besides sand and soil, there is hard rock, but the realm of life can break through stubborn rocks and extend to strata thousands of meters below the surface. Someone has discovered the vanguard of life – microorganisms – in the water layers of oil mines two to three thousand meters deep.

    The azure blue sea occupies 71% of the Earth's surface, and there are several times more lives living in the sea than on land. Life is everywhere in the ocean. The known deepest part of the ocean is 11,034 meters, which is the latest record of the Soviet research vessel "Vityaz." Below the sea surface, the pressure increases by one atmosphere for every ten meters of depth. Therefore, in the deep sea of more than 10,000 meters, it is a dark world, and the pressure is a thousand times greater than at the surface, but schools of fish are still found there.

    Life is everywhere in the ocean, but it is not absolute. In the Dead Sea, where the salt content reaches 23%, and in Lake Tuz-Gol, where it reaches 32%, no life can exist.

    The Earth's poles are often covered with ice and snow. According to the latest records of the Soviet Antarctic expedition team, the coldest temperature on Earth is minus 87.4 degrees Celsius. However, life still struggles tenaciously at the poles. Many animals can withstand the severe cold of minus forty degrees. Polar bears and walruses, which live in ice and snow all year round, can withstand the test of minus eighty degrees. Unnoticed ducks and geese, relying on their eiderdown robes or goose down jackets, can resist low temperatures of minus one hundred degrees, but if it drops to minus one hundred and ten degrees, they will freeze to death.

    Dry seeds can still germinate after being treated at minus one hundred to two hundred degrees. Soviet scientists put apple trees and birch trees in minus one hundred to two hundred degrees and they still survived well. The most cold-resistant are bacteria. Some bacteria can survive temperatures as low as minus two hundred and fifty-two degrees in the form of spores without freezing to death. You should know that at this temperature, even hydrogen turns into a liquid.

    Life can also fight in high heat. Many algae can live in hot springs of sixty to ninety degrees. Bacteria also demonstrated their heat resistance: potato bacillus does not die after being boiled in boiling water at one hundred degrees for six hours, and thermophilic dry bacillus can be boiled for twenty-four hours without dying.

    Water is the source of life. In tropical forests, the annual rainfall is more than ten meters, but in arid deserts, life is severely tested. The drought resistance of plants in the desert is amazing. There is a kind of amaranth grass that is picked and dried into specimens, carefully preserved in a dry specimen cabinet. Three years later, the underground stem part of this specimen is taken out and soaked in water, and it can actually germinate and grow.

    Of course, life cannot persist in overly dry places. In the central Sahara Desert, there was no rain for twenty consecutive years, and no life could be found afterward.

    The size of life also differs by a hundred thousand miles. American giant sequoias are one hundred and forty-five meters tall, and the trunks are thirty-six meters thick. After they fall, people can walk in sixty meters and walk out through the tree crotch holes. Australian eucalyptus trees are one hundred and fifty-five meters tall. Microorganisms are so small that they cannot be seen with the naked eye; people can only see them with a microscope. Some bacilli are only two microns long and half a micron thick, and 100 million of them put together are only one square centimeter in size. Another non-cellular life substance, called viruses, is even smaller and can only be seen with an electron microscope. They are only equal to a protein molecule, but they are indeed a life substance. Tobacco mosaic virus is only fifteen to twenty nanometers in size, and 30,000 of them put together are only as big as one bacillus. People have discovered more than four hundred kinds of viruses. Influenza is a kind of virus's prank.

    The age of life also varies. Some bacteria have a lifespan of only twenty to thirty minutes per generation. The lifespan of many mayfly insects is only a few hours. The larvae of cicadas spend more than ten dark years underground, and finally emerge from the soil as cicadas, singing in the sun for a few weeks before dying again. Agile eagles can live for one hundred years, ominous crows can live for one hundred and forty years, and crocodiles and turtles can live for more than three hundred years. Pines can live for thousands of years, and Mexican cypresses can live for ten thousand years.

    Some lives go to sleep when the environment is harsh, as if they were dead, but after sleeping for several years, they revive once they encounter a suitable environment. Many ancient lotus seeds have been excavated from peat near Shenyang. They have been there for several thousand years. Later, the seed coats were broken and soaked in water, and they finally sprouted and grew, and even bloomed. In the Arctic permafrost zone, many remains of mammoths left over from thousands of years ago are buried and have not yet rotted. Soviet microbiologist Omelyansky found some suspended animation bacteria in the mucus of the noses of these mammoth corpses, and made these bacteria "revive" again. It can be seen how powerful life is!

    生命的领域
    乡远
    地球是生命的摇篮，从高空到地层、由赤道至两极，到处都有无数的生命在生活着，斗争着。
    在辽阔的蓝空里，可见到多少翱翔自如的飞鸟，它们一般都在四百公尺高的空中盘旋，但也有些勇士敢于向高空冲击。大鹫可以飞到七千公尺高。在珠穆朗玛峰八千二百公尺处，有人见到山鸦在飞旋。
    生命的尖兵——微生物，能随气流上升到两万多公尺的同温层里去，守卫在生命领域的最前哨。在二万至三万公尺高空处是一个臭氧层，它是地球上所有生命的保护层，太空射来能杀死生命的宇宙线就由它来吸收掉。所以地球上的生命领域，再也不能突破这道防线。不过人们可以依靠科学来把生命送入禁区。1957年11月3日苏联第二颗人造卫星上了天，里面就装有小狗莱伊卡，离地面最远时可达一百六十七万一千公尺；至今仍健在的高空探险者，要算是小狗阿莉宾娜，它数次随苏联高空火箭，飞出地面十万公尺以上，最近还生了三只小狗，成立了第一个宇宙家庭。
    在地表下面，也有不少生命在坚持着地下斗争，植物的根系，鼠洞，虫穴等有些可深延地下六至十公尺。再向下，除了沙土就是坚硬的岩石，但生命的领域可以突破顽石，扩展到几千公尺以下的地层。有人在二千至三千公尺深的石油矿的水层中，发现有生命的尖兵——微生物存在。
    蔚蓝色的大海，占去地球表面的71％，生活在海中的生命要比陆地上多好几倍。在海洋里，到处都有生命。已知的海洋最深处是一万一千零三十四公尺，这是苏联考察船“勇士号”最新的记录。在海面以下，海水每加深十公尺，压力就增加一个大气压，所以在一万多公尺的深海里，是个黑暗世界，压力比水面要大一千倍，但就在这儿仍发现鱼群。
    生命遍于海洋，也不是绝对的，在含盐量达23％的死海，达32％的土兹—果尔湖，什么生命也不能存在。
    地球的两极，经常是冰天雪地，根据苏联南极考察队最新的记录，地球上最冷的温度是零下八十七点四度。可是在两极仍有生命在顽强斗争着。很多动物都能经受零下四十多度的严寒。长年生活于冰雪之中的白熊和海象能经得住零下八十度的考验；不受人注意的鸭和鹅，靠着它们那件鸭绒袍或鹅绒袄，能抵抗零下一百度的低温，但若再下降到零下一百一十度，就会冻死。
    干燥的种子经过零下一百至二百度的处理后，仍能发芽。苏联科学家把苹果树和白桦树放在零下一百至二百度中，仍能活得很好。最能耐寒的还是细菌。有些细菌能以孢子的状态度过零下二百五十二度的低温而不会冻死。要知道，在这种温度下，连氢气都变成了液体。
    在高热中生命也能战斗，许多藻类能生活在六十至九十度的温泉中。细菌也表现了它们的耐热能力：马铃薯杆菌在一百度的沸水中煮六小时也不死，嗜热干燥杆菌更能煮二十四小时而不死。
    水是生命的源泉，热带森林中，年雨量有十公尺以上，但在干旱的沙漠里，生命就受到严重的考验。沙漠中植物的抗旱力十分惊人，有种苋芁草，被人采来压干成标本，小心地保存在干燥的标本柜中，三年后再把这个标本上的地下茎部分取下浸在水里，竟然能够发芽生长。
    当然，过于干燥的地方，生命也无法坚持。在中撒哈拉沙漠，一次接连二十年没有下雨，以后就再也找不到生命了。
    生命的大小，也相差十万八千里，美洲的巨杉有一百四十五公尺高，树干有三十六公尺粗，倒下后，人可以走进去六十公尺，再由树桠洞里走出来。澳洲的油加利树有一百五十五尺高。而微生物小得肉眼看不见，只有用显微镜，人们才能看到它。有些杆菌只有二微米长，半微米粗，一亿个拼起来才有一平方厘米大。另一种非细胞结构的生命物质，名叫病毒的，更小得只能用电子显微镜才能见到。它们只等于一个蛋白质分子，但确是一种生命物质。烟草花叶病毒，只有十五至二十毫微米大，三万个拼起来才有一个杆菌大。人们已发现了四百多种病毒。流行性感冒，就是一种病毒的恶作剧。
    生命的年龄也各有千秋。有些细菌一代寿命只有二十至三十分钟。不少蜉蝣科昆虫的寿命只有几小时。蝉的幼虫在地下熬过十几个黑暗的年头，终于出土成蝉，在阳光中歌唱了几个星期就又死去了。矫健的雄鹰能活一百年，不吉祥的乌鸦能活一百四十年，鳄鱼、龟能活三百年以上。松能活几千年，墨西哥柏树活到一万年。
    有些生命在环境恶劣时就睡大觉，像死了似的，但是，睡了若干年后，一旦遇到适合的环境，便复苏过来。在沈阳附近的泥炭里曾挖出不少古代莲子，已有好几千年了，后来把种皮弄破浸在水里，终于又出芽成长，而且还开了花。在北极冻土带中，埋着许多几千年前遗留下来的猛犸的尸体，至今还未腐烂。苏联微生物学家奥梅良斯基在这些猛犸尸体的鼻子的粘液中找到一些假死的细菌，并且使这些细菌又“复活”了过来。可见生命的力量是多么强大！
