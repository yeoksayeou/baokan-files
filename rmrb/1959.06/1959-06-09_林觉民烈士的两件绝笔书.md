Martyr Lin Juemin's Two Last Letters

The two last letters of Martyr Lin Juemin, one of the seventy-two martyrs of Huanghuagang, were recently donated to the Fujian Museum for collection by the martyr's son, Lin Zhongxin.

These two last letters were written by Lin Juemin himself three days before the siege of the Qing government's Liangguang Governor-General's Office. One was written to his wife, Chen Yiying, and the other to his father. The last letter to Chen Yiying was written with a brush on a white handkerchief, and the words are tragic and impassioned. One passage reads: "...Since I met you, I have always wished that all lovers in the world could be together. However, dark clouds cover the land, and wolves and dogs fill the streets. How many families can truly have their wishes fulfilled?... As the saying goes, the benevolent man cares for the elderly as he cares for his own, and cares for the young as he cares for his own. I expand my love for you to help all people in the world love what they love. That is why I dare to die before you, without regard for you. After your tears, you should also consider the people of the world, and be honored to sacrifice my body and your body's welfare to seek lasting happiness for the people of the world. You must not grieve."

Martyr Lin Juemin was from Minhou County, Fujian Province. He participated in the siege of the Liangguang Governor-General's Office on April 27, 1911 (March 29th of the Lunar Calendar), was wounded and captured, and heroically gave his life. He was only twenty-five years old when he sacrificed himself.

    林觉民烈士的两件绝笔书
    黄花冈七十二烈士之一林觉民烈士的两件绝笔书，最近由烈士的儿子林仲新献给福建博物馆收藏。
    这两件绝笔书是林觉民烈士在围攻清政府两广督署前三天亲笔写的，其中一件是写给他的妻子陈意映，另一件是写给他的父亲。给陈意映的绝笔书是用毛笔写在一幅白色手帕上，书中陈词悲壮激昂。其中一段写道：“……吾自遇汝以来，常愿天下有情人都成眷属，然遍地腥云，满街狼犬，称心快意，几家能彀。……语云，仁者老吾老以及人之老，幼吾幼以及人之幼，吾充吾爱汝之心，助天下人爱其所爱，所以敢先汝而死，不顾汝也。汝体吾此心于啼泣之余，亦以天下人为念，亦荣牺牲吾身与汝身之福利，为天下人谋永福也，汝其勿悲。”
    林觉民烈士是福建省闽侯县人。他在1911年4月27日（夏历3月29日）参加围攻两广督署，负伤被捕后英勇就义，牺牲时年仅二十五岁。
