    Keeping a Good Watch at Three Key Points
    From harvesting to consumption, summer grain has three important stages—harvesting, storage, and utilization. We must keep a firm grip on these to prevent any scattering or waste.
    This year, many places have paid attention to careful harvesting and rapid threshing. This is the first stage, and carelessness here can lead to a lot of grain being scattered. Therefore, we must do this well. But the second and third stages—careful storage and planned use of grain—are also important and should not be underestimated.
    Production teams in Fanshun County and two communes in Hejian County have already paid attention to doing these later two stages well. They mobilized the masses to develop many good methods for how to harvest, store, and use grain, tightly controlling the three important stages of production, management, and consumption simultaneously. They are doing the right thing. The principle is simple: if any one stage is not well managed, a large gap will appear, wasting a lot of grain. Therefore, these three stages are closely linked, and defenses must be in place at each stage; none can be missing.

### 把好三关

    把好三关
    夏粮从收到吃，有三个重要关口——收、管、用，必须牢牢把守，不让抛撒浪费。
    今年许多地方注意了细收细打，快收快打。这是第一关，这一关稍不留心，就会抛撒许多粮食，所以必须把好。可是还有第二关和第三关——周密保管和计划用粮，不能小看。
    番顺县和河间县有两个公社的生产队已经留心把好这后两关。他们发动群众研究出怎么收怎么管怎么用的许多好办法，把生产、管理和消费三个重要关口，同时紧紧把住了。他们做得很对。道理很简单，假如有一关把不住，就会出现一个大缺口，浪费掉许多粮食。因此，这三关紧密相连，必须关关设防，缺一不可。
