Anshan Iron and Steel Works Refractory Material Plant Silica Brick Workshop
Revives 120,000 Red Bricks
    (Our Report) The six drying room projects for the expansion of the Silica Brick Workshop of Anshan Iron and Steel Works Refractory Material Plant have been progressing rapidly since construction began in late April. As the earthwork project was nearing completion and bricklaying was about to begin, a problem arose: there were no red bricks. The leading cadres of the workshop were very anxious: What to do? Where to find these 120,000 red bricks?
    The leading cadres told the situation to all the workers responsible for the construction of this project. After repeated discussions among all the workers, they finally found a way out: revive waste bricks and rely on our own efforts! So the workers went to the waste brick piles left over from years of kiln repairs to recover usable waste bricks. In just a few days, they recovered 120,000 waste bricks, which completely met the needs of the six drying room projects, and saved the state more than 7,000 yuan.
    Now, all the workers responsible for the construction of this workshop are not satisfied with this. They will further boost their efforts, and in the newly undertaken expansion of the molding room of the clay workshop, while ensuring quality, they will revive another 300,000 bricks for the state, saving the state even more wealth.

    鞍钢耐火材料厂矽砖车间
    复活红砖十二万块
    本报讯　鞍钢耐火材料厂矽砖车间扩建的六个干燥室工程，从4月下旬施工以来，工程进展得很快，眼看土方工程接近交工，就要开始砌砖了。这时却遇到一个问题：没有红砖。车间的领导干部非常着急：怎么办？这十二万块红砖上哪儿去找？
    领导干部把这个情况告诉给负责建设这项工程的全体职工，经过全体职工的反复讨论，终于找到了出路：复活废砖，自力更生！于是工人们便到多年修窑换掉下来的废砖堆中去回收能用的废砖。只几天的功夫，他们就回收了十二万块废砖，完全可以满足六个干燥室工程的需要，并且为国家节约七千多元。
    现在负责建设这个车间的全体职工，并不以此为满足，他们还要进一步鼓足干劲，在新承担的粘土车间成型室扩建中，在保证质量的前提下，再为国家复活三十万块砖，给国家节约更多的财富。
