    Busy June in a Jiangnan Town
    By Our Correspondent Li Xinmin
    In June in Jiangnan, the spring harvests are already in, and the early rice seedlings are like green carpets, spread flat across the vast fields. The trimmed mulberry groves sprout new leaves from the tips of their bare branches. The spring cocoons have already gone to market, and people are preparing for summer silkworm rearing. Cucumbers are ripening, eggplants are plump, eel is fragrant, and crucian carp is fresh. The countryside is bustling, and many small towns are even more lively.
    I visited a small town on the Hang (zhou)-Jia (xing)-Hu (zhou) Plain – Chang'an Town in Ninghai County. To the north of this town is an endless expanse of rice-growing area, and to the south is a diverse range of economic crop areas. The town has well-developed land and water transportation links with the surrounding villages. Although it has only one street, just over half a mile long, it is crowded with people and bustling with activity.
    The offices of the Chang'an People's Commune are located in this town. Comrade Gu Honglin, the Deputy Secretary of the Commune Party Committee and Director of the Commune, told me that they are actively preparing to hold a celebration of the spring harvest. This year, barley, wheat, rapeseed, broad beans, and silkworm cocoons have all increased in production compared to previous years. At the same time, rural sideline occupations have also greatly developed. As a result, the more than ten thousand households in the entire commune have an average income of around 100 yuan per household. Now, the commune members are continuing to advance on the basis of their victory, striving for even greater victories in rice, jute, cotton, summer and autumn cocoons, and sideline production.
    I heard that the early market in Chang'an Town starts around three o'clock in the morning, so I got up early to take a look. At this time, the sky was still dark, and there was a hint of coolness in the fields. The stone paths stretching from the town to the various villages were already bustling with people.
    The streets were brightly lit and filled with the noise of voices. Vendors stood on both sides of the street, displaying goods brought from the countryside: fresh vegetables, chickens, ducks, fish, and eggs, as well as chicks, ducklings, and rabbits for rearing, and many other items. The shops on the street were opening one after another. The teahouses were filled with the aroma of smoke and tea, and were crowded with customers. Restaurants were also welcoming the earliest customers of the day.
    I noticed a farmer of about forty years old. He was busy selling a load of vegetables he had brought to customers. Later, after he had sold his vegetables, he went to a farmer selling chicks and bought two chirping, light-yellow chicks, placing them in the empty basket he had used to carry the vegetables. The chicks, seeing the leftover bits of gourd in the basket, pecked at them eagerly, and the old farmer's face was filled with a smile. I approached him and started talking to him. His name was Yang Zhongyi, and he had come from Xucun, fifteen miles away, leaving at two o'clock in the morning. The gourds were produced by the team, the result of collective labor; the chicks were bought by him personally, and his family would engage in some sideline occupations in addition to participating in agricultural labor. I said, "Why did you buy chicks?" He said, "To develop poultry production! Look how small these chickens are now, but by the New Year, they will weigh two pounds or so."
    This early market shows that rural sideline occupations are developing on a larger scale. The chicks and ducklings in basket after basket, after a certain period, will not be able to be contained in these baskets.
    The town also has a large-scale livestock farm that produces and raises poultry and livestock. Thirty-six large earthenware jars, each capable of hatching nine hundred chicks or seven hundred ducklings at a time, can be hatched every twenty days to a month. There is no such large hen in the world. Wu Baolong, the director of the livestock farm, said: From mid-April to early June, this farm hatched more than 100,000 chickens, ducks, and geese, some processed for the farmers, and some hatched themselves and distributed to various brigades and teams for raising. The livestock farm also raises thousands of poultry and more than one hundred pigs, thirty sows. As piglets are born, the number of animals raised will continue to increase.
    At this early market, I also saw farmers bringing loads of vegetables, sweet potato seedlings, and bundles of mulberry bark to the purchasing station, exchanging them for cash. I was very interested in the mulberry bark and asked the comrades in the shop. They said: This is a very good raw material for papermaking. In the past, farmers did not peel it much. This year, even small mulberry branches have been peeled. Each load costs 9.5 yuan, which is higher than last year. Since the beginning of this year, Chang'an Commune has signed purchase and sale contracts with various brigades and teams for twenty-seven kinds of materials, and mulberry bark is one of them.
    These days, the acquisition of spring flowers and silkworm cocoons is being carried out intensively in Chang'an Town. Farmers are using boats, carts, and carrying poles to converge from the surrounding villages to this small town. It is truly a scene of simultaneous progress on land and water, day and night, adding to the hustle and bustle of the town.
    I came to the place where rapeseed was being purchased. Many people gathered by the warehouse and on the ground, all busy, and two weighing scales were working non-stop. Some farmers who had finished transporting rapeseed were counting large stacks of banknotes, while others were resting, drinking tea, washing their faces, and listening to the radio. The dark purple and shiny rapeseed was drying on the ground, and people picked it up for a closer look, praising the good quality of the rapeseed this year.
    Inside the warehouse, many farmers were helping the staff to transport rapeseed. One of them, named Shen Songmao, told me that their Third Team of Tianming Brigade planted Victory rapeseed seeds in all their rapeseed fields this year, with an average yield of 130 jin per mu, a significant increase compared to last year. This time, he brought more than 7,000 jin, and together with the last delivery, it amounted to more than 10,000 jin, exceeding the target. Then he said, "Our team's rapeseed yield is not considered high this year. Most of the rapeseed fields in the entire commune are better than ours. We have to work harder next year!"
    The comrades at the purchasing station said that all teams are now achieving fast harvesting, fast threshing, fast drying, and fast transportation. Some Party branch secretaries and team leaders personally lead the transportation teams to ensure that this work is done well. The comrades at the purchasing station also go to the countryside in advance to help dry rapeseed, lend sacks, and organize transportation. Before transportation, the team and the purchasing station coordinate well, so that the rapeseed is weighed as soon as it arrives, without wasting time.
    In Chang'an Town, many shops selling means of production also attract many farmers. They buy all kinds of farm tools, pesticides, and fertilizers here. These days, these shops are even busier. I visited a farm tool shop in the east end, where the daily turnover is more than 1,000 yuan, sometimes as high as 2,000 yuan, many times higher than in the past.
    A young accountant from Xinmin Brigade walked into this shop with a smile, glanced at the farm tools on display, and immediately ordered three rice threshers. As soon as this business was done, several farmers came to the shop to buy small farm tools.
    There are also two farm tool factories in Chang'an Town, which both manufacture and repair farm tools for farmers. A comrade from the farm tool factory's sales department told me a figure: since June, this factory has repaired nearly 2,000 pieces of iron rakes, scrapers (for weeding), sprayers, gasoline lamps, three-light lamps, and powder sprayers for farmers. The factory's cadres and veteran workers attach great importance to the work of repairing farm tools. Sometimes, farmers bring old and broken farm tools and can pick up the repaired tools immediately. Sometimes, the veteran workers go to the countryside to repair tools on the spot.
    The Chang'an Commune Supply and Marketing Cooperative often sends staff to other places to purchase means of production to meet the needs of farmers. Silkworm rearing requires silkworm curtains, so they quickly purchased more than 2,000 from other places; pig raising requires feed, so they organized forces to go out and purchase it, with good results.
    The Supply and Marketing Cooperative is also constantly supplying farmers with various consumer goods. Department stores, cotton cloth stores, and stationery stores in Chang'an Town have prepared a lot of goods for customers, and farmers can buy what they like here. The photo shop is full of customers every day. These two days, theatrical troupes from Zhejiang Province, Hangzhou City, and Shaoxing County have come to the town to perform, and people are happy to say: It's really lively on top of lively.

    六月江南小镇忙
    本报记者　李新民
    江南的6月，春花已经收割，早稻的秧苗像一块块绿色的绒毯，平铺在广阔的原野上。经过修剪的桑林，嫩叶又从光秃的树干尖端生长出来。春茧已经上市，人们正在为夏蚕的饲养作好准备。黄瓜初熟茄子肥，鳝鱼清香鲫鱼鲜。农村一片繁忙，许多的小市镇也更加热闹起来了。
    我访问了杭（州）嘉（兴）湖（州）平原上的一个小镇——宁海县长安镇。这个镇的北面，是一望无际的水稻地区，南面是多种多样的经济作物地区。镇和四乡的水陆交通很发达。虽然它只有一条一里多路长的街道，却是人来人往，种种繁华。
    长安人民公社的办公室设在这个镇上。公社的党委副书记兼社长顾洪林同志对我说，他们正在积极准备召开庆祝春花丰收大会。今年，无论大麦、小麦、油菜、蚕豆、蚕茧，都比往年增产。与此同时，农村副业也大大发展了。这样，全公社一万多户人家，平均每户收入在百元左右。现在公社社员们正在胜利的基础上继续前进，夺取水稻、络麻、棉花、夏秋茧和副业生产的更大胜利。
    听说长安镇的早市是从三点钟左右开始的，我就起了一个早，去参观参观。这时，天空还是黑黝黝的，原野上留着几分寒意，从镇上伸向各个乡村的石板路上，已是熙熙攘攘。
    街上灯火通明，人声嘈杂。卖货的人站在街的两旁，面前摆着从农村带来的商品，有新鲜蔬菜，有鸡鸭鱼和蛋类，有供饲养的小鸡、小鸭和小兔，还有其它许多物品。街上的店铺纷纷开门了。茶馆里弥漫着烟和茶的香味，高朋满座。饮食店也在迎接着一天最早的顾客。
    我注意到一个四十岁左右的农民。他正忙着把带来的一担蔬菜卖给顾客。后来，他的菜卖完了，便走到一个卖小鸡的农民旁边，买来了两只吱吱叫着的淡黄色的小鸡，放进挑蔬菜的空箩里。小鸡看到箩里剩下的葫芦碎子，争着啄食，老农民脸上荡漾着微笑。我走近他，和他谈起来。他叫杨忠义，是早上两点钟从十五里路外许村赶来的。葫芦是小队里生产的，是集体劳动的成绩；小鸡是他自己买的，他家的人在参加农业劳动之余还要搞点副业。我说：“你为什么买了小鸡？”他说：“为发展家禽生产呀！你看这鸡小，过年时就有两斤上下了。”
    在这个早市上可以看出：农村副业在更大地发展着。面前这一篓接一篓的小鸡和小鸭，相当时期后，就不是这些篓子所能全部装下了。
    镇上还有一家大规模生产和饲养禽畜的畜牧场。三十六只大土缸，每只缸一次可以孵九百只小鸡或七百只小鸭，二十多天到一个月可以孵一次，世界上没有这样大的老母鸡吧。畜牧场主任吴宝龙说：从4月中旬到6月初，这个场孵出了十多万只鸡鸭鹅，有的是代农民加工的，有的自己孵了分配到各个大队小队去饲养。在畜牧场，还养了数千只家禽和一百多头猪，三十多头母猪，生起猪仔来，饲养的数字将越来越大。
    在这个早市上，我还看到农民把成担的蔬菜、蕃薯苗以及一捆捆的桑树皮送到收购店来，换取现钞。我对桑树皮很感兴趣，问店里的同志，他们说：这是很好的造纸原料，过去农民不大剥它，今年连小桑枝也给剥了，每担九元五角，价格比去年高些。长安公社今年以来和各大队小队订了二十七种物资的购销合同，桑树皮就是其中之一。
    长安镇这几天来，春花和蚕茧的收购工作正在紧张进行。农民们用船运，用小车送，用肩挑，从四乡汇集到这个小镇上来，真是水陆齐进，日夜不断，给小镇增添了热闹。
    我来到收购油菜籽的地方。仓库边和地坪上聚集了许多人，都在忙着，两只镑秤工作不停。还有一些送油菜籽的农民已经结束了运送工作，有的在清点一大叠钞票，有的在休息处喝茶洗脸，听广播。地坪上晒着紫黑油亮的油菜籽，人们抓起细看，同声赞扬今年菜籽好。
    在仓库里，不少农民正在帮助工作人员运送油菜籽。其中一个名叫沈松茂的告诉我，他们天明大队第三小队今年全部油菜田种了胜利油菜种籽，平均每亩收一百三十斤，比去年大大增产。这次他送来了七千多斤，连上次送来的共一万多斤，超额完成了任务。接着他又说：“我们小队油菜田今年产量还不算高，全公社大部油菜田都比我们的好，明年还得加劲干！”
    收购站的同志说：现在各个小队都做到了快收快打快晒快运。有的党支部书记、队长亲自带领运送队，保证做好这一工作。收购站的同志也事先下乡帮助晒油菜籽，出借麻袋，组织运送。在运送以前，小队和收购站联系好，送到就称，不耽误时间。
    长安镇上，许多出售生产资料的商店，也吸引了许多农民。他们在这里买到了各种农具、农药和肥料。这些天来，这些商店更显得繁忙。我访问东头一家农具店，每天营业额在一千元以上，有时高达二千元，比过去增加好多倍。
    新民大队的一个年轻的会计带着微笑走进这家商店，眼睛往陈列着的农具望了一望，马上订购了三部打稻机。这笔生意刚做完，一会儿店里马上又来了几个买小农具的农民。
    长安镇街上还有两家农具厂，既制造农具，又替农民修理农具。农具厂门市部的同志告诉我一个数字，从6月份以来，这个厂为农民修理的铁耙、刮子（除草用的）、喷雾器、汽油灯、三光灯、喷粉器等就有近二千件。厂里的干部和老师傅很重视修理农具的工作，有时农民把破旧的农具拿来，可以马上取货，有时老师傅自己下乡上门修理。
    长安公社供销部，经常派出工作人员到外地采购生产资料，满足农民的需要。养蚕要蚕帘，他们很快就从外地采购来二千多条；养猪要饲料，他们又组织力量出去采购，效果也很好。
    供销部又不断供应着农民各种生活资料。长安镇的百货、棉布、文具等商店为顾客准备了不少货物，农民在这里买到了自己喜爱的东西。照相店每天顾客盈门。这两天，浙江省、杭州市、绍兴县所属的剧团纷纷到镇上来演出，人们高兴地说：真是热闹之上加热闹。
