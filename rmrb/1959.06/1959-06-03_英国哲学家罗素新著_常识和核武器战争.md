    British Philosopher Russell's New Book
    "Common Sense and Nuclear Warfare"
The world-renowned British philosopher Bertrand Russell has published a book entitled "Common Sense and Nuclear Warfare." In the book, he discusses the catastrophic nature of nuclear warfare. He points out that small-scale wars can develop into large-scale wars, and there are still no guarantees to prohibit the production of nuclear weapons. Therefore, the only way to prevent the production of nuclear weapons is to avoid war and gradually eliminate the root causes of tension that lead to war. He believes that the dispute between capitalism and communism should not be seen as a reason serious enough to destroy half the world. He believes that ideological fanaticism and belligerent nationalism must be stopped, and sincerity towards the other side should be reasonably believed. He advocates that Taiwan should be returned to China, and all foreign troops must withdraw from Europe.

    英国哲学家罗素新著
    “常识和核武器战争”
    世界著名的英国哲学家柏特隆·罗素出版了一本书，书名是“常识和核武器战争”。他在书中论述了核武器战争的灾难性，他指出，小规模的战争会发展成为大规模的战争，而且现在还没有看见禁止制造核武器保证，因此，防止核武器生产的唯一的办法是避免战争，并逐步地消除导致战争的紧张根源。他认为资本主义同共产主义之间的纠纷不应该被看成严重到足以毁灭半个世界的理由。他认为，意识形态的狂热和好战的民族主义必须予以制止，而对对方的真诚不妨合理地轻信一下，他主张台湾应该归还中国；一切外国军队必须撤出欧洲。
