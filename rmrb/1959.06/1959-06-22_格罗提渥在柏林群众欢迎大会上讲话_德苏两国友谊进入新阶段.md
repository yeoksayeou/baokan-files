Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, June 20th: Today, 50,000 citizens of Berlin held a rally to welcome the delegation of the German Democratic Republic's party and government, which had just returned from a visit to the Soviet Union. Prime Minister Grotewohl spoke at the meeting. Grotewohl first conveyed the greetings of the Soviet Party and Government to the people of Berlin and the entire German Democratic Republic, as well as the Soviet people's good wishes for the further development of socialism in the German Democratic Republic.

He said that the delegation was received with the most heartfelt and friendly welcome everywhere in the Soviet Union. This shows that the Soviet people fully trust the people of the German Democratic Republic and believe that they will never allow a new war to break out.

Grotewohl said that the Soviet Union's peace policy is based on the solid foundation of its material strength. The Bonn government is trying its best to hinder the achievement of understanding. Obviously, the road to peace is not easy. But there is reason to be optimistic, because with the help of strong forces of peace, victory will surely be won.

Grotewohl then recounted Khrushchev's speech at the Moscow mass rally on the 19th. He said that if necessary, the Soviet Union will conclude a peace treaty with the German Democratic Republic and do its best to implement the terms of the treaty. Prime Minister Grotewohl pointed out that if it is currently impossible to conclude a peace treaty with the whole of Germany, the German Democratic Republic is also fully prepared to conclude a peace treaty with the Soviet Union.

Grotewohl said that the current government of West Germany cannot be taken seriously. Today it refuses to deal with the government of the German Democratic Republic, but one day, the German Democratic Republic will decide which of those big gentlemen in West Germany it is willing to negotiate with.

Grotewohl also said that German-Soviet friendship is of great political significance in resolving the German question. Western countries in Geneva have been forced to recognize the existence of the German Democratic Republic and deal with its representatives.

He emphasized that the delegation's visit marked a new and higher stage of German-Soviet friendship, which will help the German Democratic Republic demonstrate the superiority of socialism over capitalism. With the help of the Soviet Union, the cause of peace will surely be victorious.

Participants in the mass rally included Dr. Dieckmann, Chairman of the People's Chamber, party and government leaders, and members of the diplomatic corps.

    格罗提渥在柏林群众欢迎大会上讲话
    德苏两国友谊进入新阶段
    新华社柏林20日电　今天柏林市五万市民举行大会，欢迎刚从苏联访问归来的德意志民主共和国党政代表团。格罗提渥总理在会上讲了话。格罗提渥首先转达了苏联党和政府对柏林和整个德意志民主共和国人民的问候，以及苏联人民对德意志民主共和国进一步发展社会主义的良好愿望。
    他说，代表团在苏联到处受到最衷心的友好的欢迎。这表明，苏联人民充分信任德意志民主共和国人民，并且相信，他们永远不会允许爆发一场新的大战。
    格罗提渥说，苏联的和平政策是建立在它的物质力量的牢固的基础上。波恩政府正在竭力阻挠达成谅解，显然，走向和平的道路是不容易的。但是有理由感到乐观，因为依靠强大的和平力量的帮助，胜利是一定会赢得的。
    格罗提渥接着追述了赫鲁晓夫19日在莫斯科群众大会上的讲话。他说，如果必要的话，苏联将同德意志民主共和国缔结和约，并且尽力使和约的条款实现。格罗提渥总理指出，如果目前不可能同整个德国缔结和约的话，德意志民主共和国也已经充分准备同苏联缔结和约。
    格罗提渥说，西德的现政府是不能认真对待的。今天它拒绝同德意志民主共和国政府打交道，但是有朝一日，将由德意志民主共和国来决定在那些西德的大人先生们中间它愿意跟谁来谈判。
    格罗提渥还说，德苏友谊在解决德国问题方面具有很大的政治意义。西方国家已经在日内瓦被迫承认德意志民主共和国的存在并且同它的代表打交道。
    他强调说，代表团的访问标志着德苏友谊的一个新的和更高的阶段，它将帮助德意志民主共和国显示社会主义对资本主义的优越性。依靠苏联的帮助，和平事业一定会获得胜利。
    参加这次群众大会的，有人民议院主席狄克曼博士、党政领导人和外交使团的团员。
