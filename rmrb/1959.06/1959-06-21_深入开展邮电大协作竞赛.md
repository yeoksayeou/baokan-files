Deepen the Postal and Telecommunications Grand Collaboration Competition
By a Commentator of This Newspaper

With the development of national economic construction and the improvement of the people's material and cultural living standards, postal and telecommunications services have become indispensable communication tools for leadership organs at all levels to guide work and for the broad masses to contact each other. When people send telegrams, make phone calls, or send letters, they often hope that the postal and telecommunications departments can accurately and quickly deliver telegrams, phone calls, and mail to the other party. The "one-dragon" grand collaboration competition launched by postal and telecommunications workers across the country since April this year is precisely to further improve the quality of postal and telecommunications work, thereby better serving national construction.

The "one-dragon" competition is proposed based on the characteristics of the postal and telecommunications departments. The organization of postal and telecommunications departments is very dispersed. To deliver a telegram, a phone call, or a newspaper to the other party, it must go through several postal and telecommunications units, several procedures, and requires the cooperation of many employees. Based on this characteristic, the postal and telecommunications departments regard the entire communication process as a whole, organize relevant postal and telecommunications personnel to strengthen collaboration and conduct competitions around a common indicator, on the premise of combining individual responsibility with the joint responsibility of relevant personnel. Through the competition, both sides of a circuit and the various bureaus along a postal route can be closely organized to strive for a common goal. This strengthens mutual cooperation and coordination in the communication process from an organizational point of view, and effectively guarantees the completion of the competition indicators. This approach of organizing and leading the masses to carry out competitions according to the characteristics of the production process is an effective way to improve communication quality and speed up delivery. It is also the best measure for postal and telecommunications departments to improve labor productivity and carry out the campaign to increase production and practice economy.

After the launch of the "one-dragon" competition, postal and telecommunications enterprises in various places have taken action. Efforts are being made everywhere to ensure the rapid and accurate transmission of telegrams, telephones, and newspapers. In the process of strengthening cooperation through the "one-dragon" competition, many places have deployed the best circuits, the best cars, the most technically skilled operators, and the best escorts to ensure central communications, effectively implementing the spirit of "the whole country as one chessboard."

Because the "one-dragon" competition makes improving communication speed and quality a joint responsibility of the entire line, this has enhanced the collective concept of employees and fostered a new atmosphere of mutual cooperation, mutual learning, and common improvement.

In order to deepen this movement, it is necessary to start from the following aspects:

First, it is necessary to strengthen communist collaboration education and collectivist education of the whole country as one chessboard for all employees, and pay attention to establishing mutual assistance models in the competition movement, and promote the new atmosphere of "bringing convenience to others and leaving difficulties to oneself." To do this, it is necessary to strengthen the leadership of the Party.

Second, carrying out the "one-dragon" competition must continue to promote the experience of "two participations" and "three combinations" to strengthen enterprise management. With the deepening of the competition and the technical innovation and technical revolution movements, productivity will inevitably develop in new ways, and many new problems will arise in enterprises. At the same time, the movement itself requires political and ideological work as its foundation. Conducting mass movements on a large scale must be combined with strengthening collective leadership. Therefore, leading cadres must conscientiously participate in production, closely connect leadership with the masses, and can promptly discover key problems in production, such as: unreasonable network organization, labor organization, insufficient implementation of planned targets, irregular equipment maintenance and quality inspection, and unsound necessary management systems and responsibility systems. Once these problems are discovered, the masses must be mobilized to solve them in a timely manner.

Third, it is necessary to combine the competition with mass movements centered on technical innovation and technical revolution. After employees strengthen cooperative relationships, they will gradually change heavy labor to mechanization, semi-mechanization, and automation, which will inevitably lead to improvements in tools, equipment, and operating techniques, in order to improve work efficiency and communication quality. After the competition is launched, differences in operating technical levels, imbalances in communication equipment, and communication capabilities will continue to emerge. One bureau in Sichuan, in order to speed up telegram transmission, changed the manual machine to a Morse high-speed machine. This improvement immediately caused a production imbalance with the other bureau. In order to achieve a new balance, relevant units cooperating with it must also improve their tools and equipment through large-scale technical innovation and technical revolution. This shows that the development of the "one-dragon" competition provides broad possibilities for large-scale technical innovation and technical revolution. Therefore, postal and telecommunications departments must organize and lead well, and combine technical innovation and technical revolution with the "one-dragon" competition.

Finally, in order for postal and telecommunications departments to do a good job in communication and transmission, they must also obtain the cooperation of relevant departments. For example, in order to speed up the connection of long-distance calls in government agencies, it is necessary to obtain the cooperation of operators of small switchboards in government agencies; in order to speed up the delivery of newspapers and mail, it is necessary to obtain the cooperation of transportation departments such as railways, highways, sea transport, and aviation. Therefore, in order to carry out the competition better, so as to ensure the overall effectiveness of communication, postal and telecommunications departments must cooperate well with relevant departments.

    深入开展邮电大协作竞赛
    本报评论员
    随着国家经济建设的发展和人民物质、文化生活水平的提高，邮电事业已经成为各级领导机关指导工作、广大群众互相联系的不可缺少的通信工具。人们在发电报、打电话、通信的时候，常常希望邮电部门能准确而又迅速地把电报、电话、邮件传递给对方。从今年四月份开始，全国邮电职工开展的“一条龙”大协作竞赛，正是为了进一步提高邮电工作的质量，从而更好地为国家建设服务。
    “一条龙”竞赛，是根据邮电部门的特点提出来的。邮电部门的组织很分散，要把一个电报、一个电话或一份报刊传递给对方，要经过几个邮电单位、好几道工序，需要许多职工协作。邮电部门根据这一特点，把整个通信过程当作一个整体，组织相关的邮电工作人员围绕着一个共同的指标，在个人负责和有关人员共同负责相结合的前提下，加强协作，开展竞赛。通过竞赛，可以把一条电路的双方、一条邮路的沿线各局紧密地组织起来，为一个共同的目标奋斗。这就从组织上加强了通信过程中的互相协作配合，有力地保证了竞赛指标的完成。这种按照生产过程的特点组织领导群众开展竞赛的做法，是提高通信质量，加快传递速度的有效办法。也是邮电部门提高劳动生产率、开展增产节约运动的最好措施。
    “一条龙”竞赛运动开展后，各地邮电企业都已行动起来。处处为电报、电话、报纸等的迅速准确传递而努力。在“一条龙”竞赛加强协作的过程中，许多地方已经调最好电路、最好的汽车，技术最好的报话值机人员，最好的押运员来保证中央通信，有力的贯彻了“全国一盘棋”的精神。
    由于“一条龙”竞赛把提高通信速度和质量成为全线共同负责制，这就增强了职工的集体观念，树立了互相协作、互教互学共同提高的新风尚。
    为了使这一运动深入开展，必须从以下各方面着手：
    首先，必须向全体职工加强共产主义协作教育和全国通信一盘棋的集体主义教育，并注意在竞赛运动中树立互助标兵，提倡“把方便带给别人，把困难留给自己”的新风尚。而要做到这样，必须加强党的领导。
    其次，开展一条龙竞赛还必须继续推行“两参”“三结合”等经验，加强企业管理工作。随着竞赛和技术革新、技术革命运动的深入开展，生产力必然会有新的发展，企业中将会出现不少新的问题。同时，运动本身又需要有政治思想工作做基础。大搞群众运动必须同加强集体领导相结合，因此，领导干部必须认真参加生产，密切领导与群众的关系，就可以及时发现生产中的关键问题，例如：某些网路组织、劳动组织不合理，计划指标不够落实，设备维护检修和质量检查工作不经常的问题，必要的管理制度、责任制度不够健全等问题，发现这些问题，就要发动群众及时解决。
    再次，必须结合竞赛，开展以技术革新和技术革命为中心的群众运动。职工们在加强协作关系后，要把笨重的劳动逐步地改变为机械化、半机械化和自动化，必然会引起工具、设备和操作技术的改进，以提高工作效率和通讯质量。竞赛开展后，操作技术水平的差别、通信设备上和通信能力上的不平衡，还不断地出现。四川有一个局为了加快电报传递速度，把人工机改为莫尔斯快机，这一改进，就立刻引起与对方局生产上的不平衡。为了求得新的平衡，和它配合的有关单位，也必须通过大闹技术革新和技术革命，改进自己的工具设备。这说明“一条龙”竞赛的开展，为大闹技术革新和技术革命提供了广泛的可能性。因此，邮电部门必须很好地加以组织领导，把技术革新和技术革命和“一条龙”竞赛结合起来。
    最后，邮电部门要做好通信传递工作，还必须取得各有关部门的协作配合。例如要使机关的长途电话接线迅速，必须取得机关小交换机值机员的配合；为了加快报纸和邮件的传递速度，必须取得铁路、公路、海运、航空等交通运输部门的配合等等。因此，为了把竞赛开展得更好，以保证通信的全程效能，邮电部门必须与有关部门搞好协作。
