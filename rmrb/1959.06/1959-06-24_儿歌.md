    Children's Song
    Snowy Field
    Red sun, it's noon,
    Leaves, curled up from the sun.
    Commune members are not afraid of the heat,
    In front of Phoenix Mountain, harrowing cotton.
    Auntie's face is sunburned red,
    Uncle's clothes are soaked with sweat.
    Uncle and Auntie, take a rest,
    Drink cold tea under the shade of the trees.

    儿歌
    雪地
    红太阳，正午啦，
    树叶子，晒卷啦。
    社员叔叔不怕热，
    凤凰山前耢棉花。
    姨姨的脸儿晒红啦，
    叔叔的衣服汗透啦。
    叔叔姨姨歇歇吧，
    树荫底下喝凉茶。
