Xinhua News Agency, Paris, June 25th. The 15th Congress of the French Communist Party began its discussion of Maurice Thorez's report on June 25th.

	Political Bureau member Roger Garaudy, in his speech, analyzed the nobility of communist morality and the hypocrisy of bourgeois morality disguised as humanism. Garaudy said that the bourgeoisie is cunning, lies, and uses violence, and can use any means to achieve its goals. Bourgeois morality is a tool for capitalists to rule.

	Speaking of the Algerian War, Roger Garaudy told those who only condemned the means used by French colonists that if the goal is despicable, to keep a country's people enslaved, it will inevitably resort to despicable means.

	Garaudy said that when a war is unjust, morality will doom the unjust war to failure.

	When talking about the Communist Party's moral concept, Roger Garaudy said that Communists are willing to sacrifice if necessary to fight for happiness, but to fight for the happiness of everyone. Jean Coroge, the representative of the Pas-de-Calais Provincial Committee, condemned the destructive activities of the right-wing leadership group of the Socialist Party. Coroge said that the broad base of Socialist Party members, despite the obstacles created by the Socialist Party's leadership group, are striving to achieve unified action with the Communist Party. Now, the struggle to win a united front has achieved initial success.

	Pierre Duvaze spoke on behalf of the communists in Marseille, analyzing the decline and changes in Marseille's commerce and pointing out the necessity of nationalizing merchant ships.

	Suslov, the head of the delegation of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, also spoke at the conference on the 25th. He first extended warm, fraternal greetings to the French Communist Party and the French working people on behalf of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet people.

	He said that the main task at present is to implement the unity of action of the working class on an international scale and to unite the peasants and the middle strata around the working class. Suslov recounted the initiatives put forward by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to establish good relations with various socialist parties in Western Europe, the achievements made in this regard, and the hostility encountered by the leaders of the French Socialist Party. He said: Unity of action will greatly strengthen the power of the working class.

	Speaking of the Soviet Union's foreign policy, Suslov said: The Soviet Union's goal is to consolidate peace. Thanks to the efforts of the Soviet Union and the people of all countries, it can be seen that there are signs of improvement in the international situation; he said, however, that the danger of the revival of German militarism remains a serious concern.

	Suslov emphasized: In this regard, as De Gaulle had advocated in the past, the friendship and alliance between the Soviet Union and France are a guarantee of the security of the two countries. Suslov said that De Gaulle's past statements have been forgotten.

	Suslov reminded the French people that the German militarists would hesitate to attack the Soviet Union again, because since their disastrous defeat in the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union's strength has greatly increased. On the other hand, they may be obsessed with the easy victories they achieved in the West in 1940.

	Suslov concluded his speech by reading out the congratulatory letter from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to the French Communist Party. His final few words about friendship with the French people received a long applause, and when he handed the congratulatory letter to Thorez and embraced Thorez, all the representatives stood up and applauded for a long time, and then sang the Internationale, expressing their confidence in the strength of the people of all countries.

	The afternoon meeting continued to discuss Thorez's report. Political Bureau member Etienne Fajon spoke on the relationship between Communists and Socialists.

	Fajon said that the policy of the Socialist Party leadership remains the main obstacle to achieving unified action of the working class. He analyzed, based on the articles published by Mollet, the methods used to lead workers to positions that violate their interests.

	Fajon said that the position of the Socialist Party leadership reflects the bourgeois chauvinist and colonialist policy. This policy has caused confusion among the social strata influenced by the Socialist Party. This explains the current crisis of the Socialist Party. The establishment of an independent socialist party is only one aspect of this crisis, and the most illustrative sign of the crisis is that many socialist workers have changed their attitude towards the Communist Party.

	He emphasized the possibility of Communists and Socialists finding a common language at present, and therefore the possibility of organizing joint action. This joint action will promote and lead to a united front, and the realization of a united front is decisive for uniting all democratic forces.

	Pey, the chairman of the afternoon meeting and member of the Political Bureau of the French Communist Party, read out the congratulatory message from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the conference. Because the French government delayed issuing entry visas, the representatives of the Communist Party of China were unable to attend the conference.

	After Pey read out the congratulatory message, the audience burst into a long and warm applause.

	At the afternoon meeting, the Italian Communist Party representative Ingrao, the Polish United Workers' Party representative Clisco, and the Czechoslovak Communist Party representative Kautsky delivered congratulatory speeches. At the afternoon and evening meetings, the conference also read out congratulatory messages from the Communist Parties and Labor Parties of Greece, Spain, Vietnam, the United States, India, Australia, and Iran.

    法共代表大会讨论多列士报告
    苏共和其他兄弟党代表致贺词
    新华社巴黎25日电　法国共产党第十五次代表大会25日会议开始讨论多列士的报告。
    政治局委员罗歇·加罗迪在发言中分析了共产主义道德的高尚和在人道主义掩饰下的资产阶级道德的伪善。加罗迪说，资产阶级诡诈、撒谎和施用暴力，为了达到自己的目的可以不择手段。资产阶级的道德是资本家进行统治的工具。
    谈到阿尔及利亚战争，罗歇·加罗迪向那些仅谴责法国殖民者所使用的手段的人说，如果目的是卑鄙的，是要使一国人民继续当奴隶，这就必然要求助于卑鄙的手段。
    加罗迪说，当战争是非正义的时候，道德便将使非正义战争注定失败。
    罗歇·加罗迪在谈到共产党的道德观念时说，共产党员必要时不惜牺牲为幸福而斗争，但是是为大家的幸福而斗争。加来海峡省委员会代表让·科格在发言中谴责社会党右翼领导集团的破坏性活动，科格说，但是社会党的广大基层党员却不顾社会党领导集团所制造的障碍，努力实现同共产党的一致行动。现在，为争取联合阵线的斗争，已经得到初步成功。
    皮埃尔·杜瓦瑟代表马赛共产党员发言，他分析了马赛商业的衰退和变化，并且指出商船国有化的必要性。
    苏联共产党代表团团长苏斯洛夫也在25日的大会上讲话，他首先代表苏联共产党和苏联人民，向法国共产党和法国劳动人民致以热烈的兄弟般的祝贺。
    他说，当前主要的任务是在国际范围内实行工人阶级的一致行动，并把农民和中等阶层团结在工人阶级周围。苏斯洛夫追述了苏联共产党为了同西欧各社会党建立良好关系而提出的倡议、在这方面取得的成就以及遭到法国社会党领导人的敌视。他说：一致行动将会大大加强工人阶级的力量。
    谈到苏联的对外政策，苏斯洛夫说：苏联的目的在于巩固和平，由于苏联和各国人民的努力，已经可以看出国际局势有改善的迹象；他说，然而，德国军国主义复活的危险，仍然是一个严重的忧虑。
    苏斯洛夫强调指出：在这方面，正如戴高乐过去所主张的，苏联和法国的友谊和联盟，是两国安全的保证。苏斯洛夫说，戴高乐过去的声明已经被忘怀了。
    苏斯洛夫提醒法国人民说：德国军国主义者在向苏联再度进攻时是会犹豫的，因为自从他们在苏联惨败以来，苏联的力量又大大增长了。另一方面，他们却可能迷恋着1940年在西方轻易取得的胜利。
    苏斯洛夫结束讲话时，宣读了苏联共产党祝贺法国共产党的贺信，他最后说的对于法国人民友谊的几句话受到了长时间的鼓掌，而当他把贺信交给多列士并和多列士拥抱时，全体代表起立长时间地鼓掌，转而高唱国际歌，表达了对各国人民力量的信心。
    下午会议继续讨论多列士的报告，政治局委员艾蒂安·法戎就共产党人和社会党人的关系问题发言。
    法戎说，社会党领导机构的政策仍然是实现工人阶级一致行动的主要障碍。他根据摩勒发表的文章，分析了用来引导劳动者走上违反他们利益的立场的方法。
    法戎说，社会党领导机构的立场，反映了资产阶级沙文主义和殖民主义的方针。这种方针在社会党影响下的社会阶层中引起了混乱。这就说明了社会党目前的危机，独立社会党的建立，只是这个危机的一个方面，而最能说明危机迹象的就是许多社会党劳动者改变了对共产党的态度。
    他强调指出目前共产党人和社会党人找到共同语言的可能性，因而也就有组织共同行动的可能性。这种共同行动将推动和引向统一阵线，而统一阵线的实现，对于团结一切民主力量具有决定性的作用。
    下午会议的主席、法共政治局委员皮佑在会上宣读了中国共产党中央委员会给大会的贺电。因为法国政府拖延不发入境签证，中国共产党的代表未能参加大会。
    皮佑宣读这个贺电后，全场响起了长时间的热烈掌声。
    在下午会议上，意大利共产党代表英格拉奥、波兰统一工人党代表克利市科和捷克斯洛伐克共产党代表考茨基致贺词。在下午和夜间会议上，大会还宣读了希腊、西班牙、越南、美国、印度、澳大利亚及伊朗等国共产党及劳动党的贺电。
