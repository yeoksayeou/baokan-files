    Gele Mountain (Two Poems)
    Liang Shangquan
    At the foot of Gele Mountain, thousands of families, every family busy with wheat harvest, planting rice seedlings everywhere. The heavens don't send rain, but we have hundreds of waterwheels, connected they can make a ladder to the sky, climbing to the Milky Way to open the water gate! Even if it's dry, we'll still have a good harvest. Look! Yellow fruits, green melons, potatoes are blooming. On Gele Mountain, the engineering team is busy surveying, building an electric pumping station, with huge iron pipes ten thousand feet long, ten thousand feet long, like a dragon, sucking in the water and carrying it up the hills, spitting out a Jialing River!

  The cannon vehicles go to the frontier
    The cannon vehicles go to the frontier, leaving behind empty parking lots, piles of wheat ears reaching high, building a golden wall. Inside the wall, it's empty, tractors just starting up, long wheel tracks stretching out into the vast fields; outside the wall, it's busy, windmills are fanning, threshing is sounding, the training ground has become a threshing ground. In the orchard by the field, the sunbird is singing "Rice is expensive in Guiyang," its call travels to the frontier, border artillery soldiers go to their posts, surely they'll look towards this side…

    歌乐山（二首）
    梁上泉歌乐山下，几千户人家，家家麦收忙，处处把秧插。老天不下雨，我们有水车千百架，接起可作上天梯，爬到银河开水闸！天再旱，也要收到好庄稼。看看呢！黄的果，绿的瓜，洋芋正开花。歌乐山上，工程队测量忙，要建电力抽水站，巨大的铁管万丈长，长万丈，像条龙，吸饮流水上高岗，吐出一条嘉陵江！
  炮车远去边疆炮车远去边疆，空留下停车房，麦穗高高堆起，砌起一道黄金墙。墙内空空，拖拉机刚刚出动，轮痕长长，伸到广阔的田野上；墙外忙忙，风车正在搧，挞斗正在响，练兵场成了打麦场。场边果园里，阳雀叫着“米贵阳”，叫声传到边防，边防炮兵去上岗，定要望望这一方……
