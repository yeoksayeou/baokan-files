Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 22nd: The Soviet newspaper "Pravda" published an editorial on June 22nd regarding the joint communiqué of the Soviet-German talks, stating that the nearly two-week friendly visit to the Soviet Union by the party and government delegation of the German Democratic Republic was a new milestone in the development of friendly relations between the Soviet and German peoples.

The editorial pointed out that the leaders of the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic comprehensively studied the issue of ensuring lasting peace and discussed issues related to the international situation, ensuring European security, the situation in Germany and West Berlin, and the further development of friendly cooperation between the two countries. The talks were conducted with a complete consensus of views.

The editorial emphasized that the Soviet and German peoples clearly understand that the most important guarantee of lasting world peace is the easing of tensions in Europe, and that resolving the German question and eliminating the occupation regime in West Berlin are the keys to this issue.

The editorial stated that although the Second World War launched by German fascists pushed Germany to the brink of national disaster, today, Federal German Chancellor Adenauer, with the support of Western countries, is still embarking on the shameful path of fascist leaders.

The editorial pointed out that the German people may pay an extremely high price for the harmful policies of Adenauer and his instigators. Therefore, the German people should find the strength to resolutely answer the cursed policies of revanchists and warmongers with a "no." The editorial emphasized that this is no longer 1941, and the forces of peace and socialism are surpassing the forces of war and reaction.

The editorial said that the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic will continue to fight tirelessly to ease tensions in Europe in the future. The two governments will steadfastly strive to conclude a peace treaty with Germany. If the Western aggressive bloc undermines reconciliation on this basis, then those countries that genuinely care about consolidating peace and European security will sign a peace treaty with the German Democratic Republic.

The editorial said that the situation created by preserving the occupation regime in West Berlin is intolerable. The governments of the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic are ready to work with all relevant countries to seek mutually acceptable solutions to the West Berlin issue. They are deeply convinced that the best way to solve this problem before Germany is reunified is to turn West Berlin into a demilitarized free city with reliable guarantees. Such a solution would neither affect the way of life that has formed in West Berlin, nor would it create a dangerous source of international tension in the heart of Europe. The Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic have always been loyal to their advocacy of maintaining peace and cannot allow the occupation regime to remain indefinitely in West Berlin, which is located within the territory of the German Democratic Republic. They are determined to take all necessary measures to quickly eliminate the abnormal state of West Berlin.

The editorial emphasized that peace-loving people from all countries unanimously welcome the communiqué of the meeting between the party and government delegations of the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic, considering it a significant contribution to the cause of safeguarding and consolidating peace.

The editorial emphasized that the first worker-peasant state in German history has existed for ten years and is becoming increasingly prosperous. It is confidently leading the working people to victory in a peaceful economic competition with the Federal Republic of Germany.

The editorial said that the visit of the party and government delegation of the German Democratic Republic to the Soviet Union will help the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, the two militant parties of the working class, to come closer together, resolutely defend the purity of Marxism-Leninism, and resolutely repel all forms of revisionist manifestations.

The editorial concluded by saying that the friendship between the peoples of the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic is an outstanding example of the mutual relations between fraternal socialist countries. This friendship is a valuable contribution to strengthening the solidarity of the peoples of all countries in the great socialist camp.

    苏联“真理报”评苏德会谈公报
    解决德国问题是和平的关键
    新华社22日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联“真理报”22日就苏德会谈联合公报发表社论说，德意志民主共和国党政代表团在苏联进行的将近两周的友好访问是苏联人民和德国人民友好关系发展中的新的里程碑。
    社论指出，苏联和德意志民主共和国两国领导人全面研究了保障持久和平的问题，并且讨论了有关国际局势、保障欧洲安全、德国和西柏林局势的问题以及两国之间进一步发展友好合作的问题。会谈是在观点完全一致的情况下进行的。
    社论强调说，苏联人民和德国人民清楚地知道，世界持久和平最重要的保证是欧洲紧张局势的缓和，而解决德国问题和消除西柏林的占领制度是这个问题的关键。
  社论说，虽然由于德国法西斯发动的第二次世界大战把德国推到了民族灾难的边缘，但是德意志联邦共和国总理阿登纳今天在西方国家的支持下仍然走上了法西斯领袖的可耻道路。
    社论指出，德国人民可能要为阿登纳和他的唆使者有害的政策付出极高的代价。因此，德国人应当找到力量，坚决用“不”字来回答复仇主义和战争狂的可诅咒的政策。社论强调说，现在已经不是1941年了，和平和社会主义的力量正在超过战争和反动的力量。
    社论说，苏联和德意志民主共和国今后将不倦地为缓和欧洲紧张局势而继续进行斗争。两国政府将坚定不移地争取缔结对德和约。如果西方侵略集团破坏在这一基础上媾和，那么，那些真正关心巩固和平和欧洲安全的国家将同德意志民主共和国签订和约。
    社论说，由于在西柏林保存占领制度而形成的局面是不能容忍的。苏联和德意志民主共和国两国政府准备同一切有关国家共同寻求彼此都能够接受的解决西柏林问题的办法。它们深信，在德国恢复统一之前解决这个问题的最好办法是把西柏林变为拥有可靠保证的非军事化自由城市。用这样的解决办法既不会影响西柏林所形成的生活方式，又可以消除在欧洲中心造成国际紧张局势的危险策源地。苏联和德意志民主共和国两国始终忠于自己的维护和平的主张，不能允许在位于德意志民主共和国境内的西柏林无限期地保留占领制度。它们决心采取一切必要措施来迅速消除西柏林的不正常状态。
    社论强调说，各国爱好和平的公众对苏联和德意志民主共和国两国党政代表团的会谈公报一致表示欢迎，认为这是对于维护和巩固和平事业的重大贡献。
    社论着重指出，德国人民历史上第一个工农国家存在已有十年，并且日益繁荣昌盛。它在同德意志联邦共和国的和平经济竞赛中满怀信心的引导劳动人民走向胜利。
    社论说，德意志民主共和国党政代表团访问苏联将有助于苏联共产党和德国统一社会党这两个工人阶级的战斗的党更加紧密地接近，并且坚决捍卫马克思列宁主义的纯洁性和给予形形色色的修正主义表现以坚决回击。
    社论最后说，苏联和德意志民主共和国两国人民的友谊是兄弟的社会主义国家相互关系的卓越榜样。这个友谊是对加强整个伟大的社会主义阵营各国人民团结一致的宝贵的贡献。
