This newspaper Chengdu, 18th. Lezhi and Anyue counties in Sichuan Province have achieved a large-scale wheat harvest. In Lezhi County, of the 190,000 mu of wheat planted this year, 90,000 mu have already been threshed, with an average per-mu yield of 501 jin. In Anyue County, of the 270,000 mu of wheat planted this year, 120,000 mu have already been threshed, with an average per-mu yield of over 410 jin. This year, the unit area yield of wheat in these two counties has increased by about one and a half times compared to last year.
　　
Furthermore, the people of Lezhi and Anyue counties in Sichuan Province, in order to jointly strive for a large-scale wheat harvest this year, have enthusiastically launched a friendly competition, learning from each other, promoting each other, keeping up with each other, and advancing hand in hand, overcoming serious natural disasters and achieving unprecedented harvests.
　　
Lezhi and Anyue are adjacent, both being hilly areas. Due to poor soil and backward farming techniques, wheat yields have always been very low. After the communization last year, the desire and enthusiasm of the broad masses of commune members to strive for a wheat harvest increased greatly. The leadership departments of the two counties guided the situation, leading the masses of the two counties to take breaking through the low-yield wheat barrier as a common goal and launching a friendly competition. Anyue County first issued a challenge, and Lezhi County immediately put forward the slogan of "Learn from Anyue, Catch up with Anyue, Surpass Anyue," mobilizing the people of the whole county to respond to the challenge. At the beginning of the competition, the enthusiasm of the people of the two counties to compete for advancement and compare their efforts was extremely high. In the areas where the two counties border, the communes and teams were in close contact, and the commune members beat gongs and drums to send challenge letters and response letters to each other; on the slopes and ridges on both sides, there were large-character slogans and slogans promoting the competition everywhere.
　　
The friendly competition generated a huge driving force, and the people of the two counties made leaps and bounds in mutual learning and mutual encouragement. Lezhi County initially became blindly optimistic and complacent because the deep plowing, application of base fertilizer, and sowing specifications and quality were much better than in previous years. The Lezhi County Party Committee organized more than 100 people, including the Party Committee Secretaries of each commune and the Branch Secretaries of each district team, to hold on-site meetings in Anyue. After on-site visits and comparisons, everyone was shocked. They found that the wheat in Anyue County was generally deeply plowed to more than one and a half feet, applied about 100,000 jin of base fertilizer, and the seedling stands were very neat and strong, all of which were better than the situation in their own county. Therefore, each district and each commune held meetings overnight, mobilizing the commune members to catch up quickly. The whole county formulated a plan to catch up with Anyue in the short term, launching a shock movement centered on eliminating third-class seedlings. Within a week, an additional top dressing was applied to all the wheat, and it was watered once; the seeds with poor sowing quality were reprocessed, the missing seedlings were replenished, the missing nests were replenished, the excessively dense ones were thinned, and the pests were treated. Under the careful cultivation of the 2,400 professional teams in the county, the wheat seedling stands became better day by day.
　　
For a period of time, some cadres and masses in Anyue County, seeing that the seedling stands were growing very well and hearing the visitors praise them, also developed a paralyzing thought, relaxed the management of the wheat fields, and waited for a harvest. After the Anyue County Party Committee discovered this, it also organized a visiting group to visit Lezhi. They saw that Lezhi County had strengthened field management and the seedling stands had caught up with their own. After returning, each commune held a mobilization rally for field management, rectified the field management organization, established and improved the field management responsibility system, the field management became more and more detailed, and the seedling stands grew better and better.
　　
In the friendly competition of learning from each other's strengths and making up for each other's weaknesses, and exchanging experiences in a timely manner, the two counties implemented the "Eight-Character Charter" in accordance with local conditions. For example, in order to solve the problem of fertilizer shortage, Lezhi County, based on the characteristics of having more green manure in hilly areas, accumulated a large amount of green manure, built a green manure soaking pond for every three mu of wheat field, mixed the accumulated green manure with some ternary manure and lime in it, and used it as needed, which was convenient for applying fertilizer by observing the seedlings. Soon after, these green manure soaking ponds also appeared in large numbers beside the wheat fields in Anyue. Similarly, the method created by Anyue County of mixing thousand-foot mud, old wall mud, and bean skin mud with ternary manure and piling it up on the edge of the field for fermentation, and then using it as top dressing, was quickly adopted by various places in Lezhi County.
　　
This year, both counties encountered serious natural disasters in the later stage of wheat growth. During the wheat heading and flowering period, Anyue County was hit by several heavy storms. Lezhi County had not had a thorough rain for more than 40 days after the wheat flowered. However, the people of the two counties showed tenacious fighting spirit under mutual encouragement and mutual help. In Anyue County, when the storm occurred, 300,000 laborers were mobilized, working day and night to rescue the wheat, and within two and a half days, all the more than 60,000 mu of wheat that had been knocked down by the wind and rain were helped up. At the same time, using Lezhi County's experience in cultivating soil to strengthen the roots, the roots of 100,000 mu of wheat with the risk of lodging were cultivated with soil one to two times, limiting the expansion of the lodging area. In the fight against drought, the people of Lezhi County mobilized 200,000 people, intercepting streams and diverting water, carrying water to fight drought. Most of the wheat fields in this county are on hillsides, far from water sources, and carrying water requires a lot of labor. However, driven by the slogan of "Learn from Anyue, Catch up with Anyue, Surpass Anyue," the wheat fields were generally watered and fertilized two or three times, and the high-yield fields were watered five to six times. They also learned from Anyue's experience and strengthened lodging prevention and resistance measures, so that the wheat seedlings maintained normal growth and no yellowing, wilting, or lodging was found.
　　
After the bumper wheat harvest, the competition between the two counties became even more heated. The content of the competition expanded from wheat production to all aspects such as sericulture, cotton, and sideline occupations. The people of the two counties are determined to use even greater efforts than in wheat production to win a comprehensive bumper harvest throughout the year. (Attached picture)

    乐至安岳两个低产县热烈竞赛携手并进
    二十万亩小麦亩产量陡增一倍半
    乐至：九万亩亩产五百零一斤；安岳：十二万亩亩产四百十多斤
    本报成都18日电　四川省乐至和安岳两县获得小麦大面积丰收。乐至县在今年种植的十九万亩小麦中，现已脱粒的九万亩，平均亩产五百零一斤。安岳县在今年种植的二十七万亩小麦中，现已脱粒的十二万亩，平均亩产四百一十多斤。今年这两个县的小麦单位面积产量比去年增加一倍半左右。
    又讯　四川省乐至和安岳两县人民，为了共同争取今年小麦大面积丰收，热烈展开了友谊竞赛，互相学习，互相推动，你追我赶，携手前进，战胜了严重的自然灾害，双双获得空前的丰收。
    乐至和安岳紧邻，同是丘陵区，由于土地贫瘠和耕作技术落后，小麦产量一向很低。去年公社化后，广大社员争取小麦丰收的愿望和干劲高涨，两县领导部门因势利导，领导两县群众以突破小麦低产关作为共同奋斗目标，展开友谊竞赛。安岳县首先发出战表，乐至县随即提出“学安岳、赶安岳、超安岳”的口号，动员全县人民应战。竞赛一开始，两县人民争先进、比干劲的情绪极为热烈。两县交界地区的社与社、队与队短兵相接，社员们敲锣打鼓把挑战书、应战书送到对方；双方的山坡上和田坎上，到处都写着开展竞赛的大字标语和口号。
    友谊竞赛产生了巨大的推动力量，两县人民在互相学习、互相鼓励中飞跃前进。乐至县最初由于深耕、施底肥以及播种的规格质量比历年好得多，部分干部和群众一度盲目乐观，自满松劲起来。乐至县委便组织各公社党委书记和各区队的分支书记一百多人，到安岳开现场会议。经过实地参观对比，大家吃了一惊。他们发现安岳全县小麦普遍深耕在一尺五寸以上，施底肥十万斤左右，苗架十分整齐健壮，都比自己县里的情况好。于是，各区、各公社连夜召开会议，动员社员急起直追。全县制定了苗架短期赶上安岳的计划，展开一个以消灭三类苗为中心的突击运动。在一个星期内，给全部小麦增施了一道追肥，浇了一次水；对部分播种质量差的重新加工，缺苗的补苗，缺窝的补窝，过密的匀稀，有虫的治虫。在全县二千四百个专业队的精心培育下，小麦苗架一天比一天好。
    有一段时期，安岳县部分干部和群众看到苗架长得很好，听到参观的人赞不绝口，也产生了麻痹思想，放松了麦田管理，坐等丰收。安岳县委发现后，也组织参观团到乐至参观。他们看到乐至县由于加强了田间管理，苗架已经赶上自己。回去之后，各公社召开了田间管理动员誓师大会，整顿了田间管理组织，建立和健全了田间管理责任制，田间管理越做越细，苗架越长越好。
    两县在取长补短、及时交流经验的友谊竞赛中，因地制宜地贯彻了“八字宪法”。如乐至县为解决缺肥问题，根据丘陵区青肥较多的特点，大积青肥，每三亩麦田修建一个泡青池，把积来的青肥掺合一些三合粪和石灰沤在里面，随用随取，便于看苗施肥。接着，安岳的麦田旁也大量出现了这种泡青池。同样，安岳县创造的用千脚坭、老墙坭、豆皮坭掺合三合粪堆在田边发酵，然后用作追肥的办法，也很快被乐至县各地采用。
    今年，两县在小麦生长后期，都曾遇到严重的自然灾害。小麦抽穗扬花期间，安岳县连续遭到几次狂风骤雨。乐至县小麦在扬花后，四十多天内没有下过透雨。但是两县人民在互相激励、互相帮助下，表现了顽强的斗志。安岳县当暴风雨发生后，出动了三十万劳动大军，日夜抢救，在两天半的时间内，把被风雨压倒的六万多亩小麦全部扶了起来。同时还运用乐至县的培土固根经验，给十万亩有倒伏危险的小麦根部培土一至二次，限制了倒伏面的扩大。乐至县人民在和干旱搏斗中，出动了二十万人，截溪断流，车水挑水抗旱。这个县的麦田大都在山坡上，距水源远，挑水车水需要很多的劳力，但在“学安岳、赶安岳、超安岳”竞赛口号的推动下，一般麦田浇水施肥二次三次，高产田五次到六次。他们还吸取了安岳的经验，加强防倒抗倒措施，使麦苗一直保持正常生长，没有发现翻黄、枯萎或倒伏现象。
    小麦大丰收后，两县之间的竞赛更热烈了。竞赛内容由小麦生产扩大到蚕桑、棉花、副业等各方面。两县人民决心用比小麦生产中更大的干劲，夺取全年全面大丰收。（附图片）
