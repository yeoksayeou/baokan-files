Little Facts

    Sesame, along with soybeans, peanuts, and rapeseed, is known as one of China's four major oil crops. Sesame is widely cultivated in China: areas north of the Yellow River mostly sow in the spring, called spring sesame; between the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers, most sow after the summer harvest, called summer sesame; areas south of the Yangtze River, such as Jiangxi and Hunan provinces, mostly sow after the harvest of early soybeans, early corn, and early rice, called autumn sesame or late sesame. Sesame yields the most oil, typically extracting about 45 to 50 jin of sesame oil per 100 jin of sesame. If a mu of sesame yields 150 jin, it can produce about 75 jin of oil, which, compared to the oil yield of other oil crops, is equivalent to 300 jin of peanuts, or over 200 jin of rapeseed, or 600 jin of soybeans.
    Sesame has great economic value. The seeds and oil are important raw materials for the food industry, such as pastries and candies, as well as for manufacturing soap and medicines. Crude sesame oil can also be used as machine lubricant. The fragrance extracted from the glands, leaves, and flowers of the sesame plant can be used to make perfumes. Sesame cake is not only a fine feed for livestock and poultry but also a good fertilizer. Sesame flowers and leaves can also be used as medicine. In particular, sesame flowers have abundant nectar, and along with rapeseed and buckwheat, are known as China's three major honey source crops.

    芝麻
    芝麻和大豆、花生、油菜，称为我国四大油料作物。芝麻在我国栽培很普遍：黄河以北地区多为春种，称春芝麻；长江黄河之间，多在夏收后播种，称夏芝麻；长江以南如江西、湖南等省多在早黄豆、早玉米和早稻等收获后播种，称秋芝麻或晚芝麻。芝麻出油最多，通常每百斤可榨出四十五斤至五十斤左右的芝麻油。种一亩芝麻，亩产量若是达到一百五十斤，就可产油七十五斤左右，与其他油料作物出油率相比，等于三百斤花生，或二百多斤菜子，或六百斤大豆。
    芝麻的经济价值很大。种子和油是糕点、糖果等食品工业，及制造肥皂、医药品的重要原料。粗制的芝麻油，还可作为机器的润滑油。从芝麻植株的密腺、叶和花中提出的香料，可制造香水。芝麻饼又是家畜家禽的精饲料，又是良好的肥料。芝麻的花和叶还可以作药。特别是芝麻花有很多的蜜，与油菜、荞麦同称为我国的三大蜜源作物。
