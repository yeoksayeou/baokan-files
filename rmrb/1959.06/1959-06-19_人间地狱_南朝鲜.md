    Hell on Earth - South Korea
    Editor's Note: The Japanese "Akahata" newspaper published a comprehensive report on March 12th, exposing the actual situation in South Korea, revealing the dark conditions of South Korea, which is like hell on earth. We now present a translated excerpt:

    Under the rule of the United States and Syngman Rhee in South Korea, one sees nothing but unemployment, hunger, and oppression. According to the Japanese government, thousands of Koreans smuggle themselves into Japan every year. Among the Korean residents in Japan who are now demanding to return to democratic Korea, 95% originally came from South Korea.

    Foreign journalists have described the actual situation in South Korea as follows: A Swedish journalist said, "I went to hell and back." A French journalist said, "In South Korea, the realization of democracy is more difficult than a rose growing out of a trash can."

    Due to the plunder by the United States and the misgovernment of the Syngman Rhee regime, South Korea's national industry has been destroyed, and the market is flooded with American goods. 80% of small and medium-sized enterprises are either shut down or partially operating. In the two years from 1955 to 1957 alone, more than 2,500 small and medium-sized enterprises went bankrupt. Industrial production is less than half of what it was during the Japanese occupation.

    The country cannot even manufacture fertilizers and agricultural machinery, but 95% of the national budget is spent on military and administrative affairs. South Korea, once known as a granary, is now completely changed. The planting area originally reached 600,000 cho (one cho is approximately 15 mu), but it has now decreased, and there is an annual shortage of 5.7 million koku of grain (one koku is approximately 180 liters).

    According to 1958 statistics, there are 4.28 million unemployed people. It is said that the only way to find work is to become a "soldier or policeman." The number of farmers who are "foodless" (they have harvests, but they have to pay high rents and debts, leaving them with no food) reaches 3 million, and they live by eating grass roots and tree leaves.

    People's lives "In South Korea, there is no freedom except the freedom to become a beggar." The number of people without housing reaches 2.6 million. It is said that there are 200,000 orphans and 600,000 widows caused by the war. They receive no relief and wander in the cities. There are as many as 200,000 prostitutes. The United States and the Syngman Rhee clique, in order to deceive the suffering people, have recently attempted to force immigration under the pretext of "overpopulation" and "unemployment relief."

    Bribery and favoritism are rampant in schools. As long as you have money, you can enroll without taking an exam. Zhao Zaijue, a student at an elementary school in Chungcheongnam-do, "could not enter middle school because he had no money, and hanged himself in grief." In order to pay tuition fees, students line up at blood-buying hospitals. "Xin Dongjun of Yeongdeungpo High School of Technology in Seoul sold 380 CC of blood, which led to his death." Schools lack classrooms, with elementary schools lacking 33,600 classrooms and middle schools lacking more than 3,000 classrooms. Some schools even hold classes in tents. Therefore, there are more than 440,000 children who do not attend school, more than 560,000 children who lose the opportunity to go to higher education, and as many as 610,000 elementary school students who cannot afford lunch.

    The Syngman Rhee clique, fearing popular resistance, has formed an army and police force of 720,000 people. It has also formulated the so-called "National Security Law," which "comprehensively treats everyone as a lawbreaker." The "Korean Police Duty Law" even prohibits "schools from organizing alumni associations and prohibits citizens from entering and leaving parks at will." Cho Bong-am, who ran against Syngman Rhee for president and advocated "peaceful reunification of the motherland," was sentenced to death for violating national policy.

    Many widows in South Korea who lost their husbands in the war have no means of support. Here is a widow and her little girl sitting in front of a bank in Seoul, crying.

专栏：外论摘要

    人间地狱——南朝鲜
    编者按：日本“赤旗报”3月12日刊载了一篇揭露南朝鲜实际情况的综合报道，揭露了宛如人间地狱的南朝鲜的黑暗情况，现摘译如下：
    在美国和李承晚统治下的南朝鲜，满眼是失业、饥饿和压迫的现象；据日本政府公布，每年有几千个朝鲜人偷渡到日本。现在要求回到民主朝鲜的旅日朝侨中，95％的原籍就是在南朝鲜。
    外国记者是这样描述南朝鲜的实际情况的，一位瑞典记者说：“我到地狱里去了一趟，”一位法国记者说：“在南朝鲜民主的实现比垃圾箱里长出蔷薇花还要困难。”
    由于美国的掠夺和李承晚政权的恶政，南朝鲜的民族工业遭到破坏，美国货充斥市场。有80％的中小企业不是停工就是部分开工，仅仅在1955年到1957年的两年间，就有二千五百多个中小企业破产。工业生产量还不到日本统治时代的一半。
    在本国甚至连肥料和农业机器也不能制造，但是国家预算的95％却用在军事和行政方面。过去南朝鲜以谷仓著称，现在已面貌全非了。播种面积原来达到六十万町步（每町步约合十五市亩），现在已经减少，每年缺粮五百七十万日石（每一日石约为一百八十公升）。
    根据1958年的调查数字，失业者有四百二十八万人，据说，要找工作只有去当“兵和警察”。“绝粮”农民（他们尽管有收获，但是都得缴纳高昂地租和还债，剩不下任何食物）竟达三百万人，他们啃着草根和树叶过日子。
    人民生活“在南朝鲜除有沦为乞丐的自由以外，没有任何自由”，没有住宅的人竟达二百六十万人。据说，战争造成的孤儿有二十万人，战争造成的寡妇有六十万人，她们得不到任何救济，在城市中流浪，娼妓竟达二十万人。美国和李承晚集团为了对遭受痛苦的人民进行欺骗，最近企图以“人口过剩”和“失业救济”为名，强迫移民。
    学校盛行贿赂和循私情，只要有钱，就可以不经过考试入学。忠清南道的一所小学的学生赵在觉“无钱不能升中学，在悲痛之余上了吊”。为了缴学费，学生们在收买血液的医院排队等候，“汉城市永登浦高等工业学校辛东均出卖了三百八十CC的血液，以致死亡”。学校缺少教室，小学缺少三万三千六百间教室，中学缺少三千多间教室，有的学校甚至在帐篷里上课。因此没有上学的儿童有四十四万多人，失去升学机会的儿童有五十六万多人，吃不上中饭的小学生竟达六十一万人。
    李承晚集团害怕人民反抗，编成了七十二万人的军队和警察队。还制订了所谓“无所不包地把一切人都当做违法者”的“国家保安法”。“韩国警职法”，甚至禁止“学校组织同学会，禁止市民随便出入公园。同李承晚竞选总统、并且主张“和平统一祖国”的曹奉岩，被以违反国策的罪名判处死刑。
    南朝鲜许多在战争中丧失了丈夫的寡妇生活无告。这里是一个寡妇和她的小女孩坐在汉城一家银行门前哭泣。
