Xinhua News Agency, Havana, June 13th: Cuban Prime Minister Castro said on the evening of the 12th, in response to reporters' questions, "We oppose the establishment of any form of international police force for Latin American countries." He said that each country should maintain order within its own borders. "Now, when the various dictatorial regimes in Latin America are about to end, it is very strange that they are beginning to be concerned about the issue of an international police force."

According to the Cuban newspaper "Hoy," U.S. Senator Smathers proposed to the U.S. Senate the establishment of a police force for the Organization of American States, believing that "since Fidel Castro came to power, a storm has threatened the Caribbean."

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, June 12th: According to the Cuban "July 26th Movement" newspaper "Revolución," the U.S. Senate recently passed a resolution to allocate $29.5 million in "loans" to establish a so-called "police force" for the Americas. "Revolución" published an editorial today strongly condemning the aforementioned U.S. decision.

The editorial stated that, from all perspectives, the U.S. action of providing loans to establish an American "police force" is an infringement on the sovereignty of Latin American countries and an undisguised act of aggression on the part of the United States. In this way, the U.S. Senate is closely colluding with the dictators Trujillo, Stroessner, and Somoza of the Americas.

The editorial pointed out that the U.S. Senate's actions demonstrate that the United States is unwilling to give up its hegemonic position in the Americas and is flaunting its many gallows and swords. The editorial said that the United States refuses to give any aid to Latin American countries, but is always willing to provide military aid for the establishment of so-called "collective defense" in this hemisphere. The truth is that the United States wants to protect itself and its lackeys through the dictatorial regimes and vassal regimes of Latin America. The editorial concluded by saying that Cuba hopes that the Organization of American States will resolutely condemn those barbaric acts of infringing on the rights of the people.

    卡斯特罗发表声明
    反对建立美洲“警察部队”
    指出应由各国自理国内秩序
    新华社哈瓦那13日电　古巴总理卡斯特罗12日晚在回答记者问题时说：“我们反对为拉丁美洲国家建立任何形式的国际警察部队”。他说，每个国家都应该维持它国内的秩序。“现在，当拉丁美洲的各个独裁政权将告结束的时候，他们却开始关心起国际警察部队的问题来，这是非常奇怪的”。
    据古巴“今日报”报道，美国参议员马瑟斯曾向美国参议院提议建立一支美洲国家组织的警察部队，他认为“从菲德尔·卡斯特罗上台起，暴风雨就威胁着加勒比海”。
    新华社哈瓦那12日电　据古巴“7月26日运动”机关报“革命报”报道，美国参议院最近通过决议，决定拨出二千九百五十万美元“贷款”用来建立一支所谓美洲国家“警察部队”。“革命报”今天发表了社论，强烈谴责美国上述决定。
    社论说，从各方面看，美国贷款用来建立美洲国家“警察部队”的行动，是对拉丁美洲国家主权的侵犯，是美国方面明目张胆的侵略行为。这样，美国参议院就同美洲的独裁者特鲁希略、斯特罗斯纳和索摩查密切地勾结起来。
    社论指出，美国参议院的行动表明，美国并不甘心放弃它在美洲称王称霸的地位，并且炫示他们拥有很多绞架和刀剑。社论说，美国拒绝给拉丁美洲国家任何援助，可是却随时愿意为建立所谓本半球的“共同防御”而提供军事援助。事实的真相是，美国想通过拉丁美洲的独裁政权和附庸政权去保卫它自己和它的走卒。社论最后说，古巴希望美洲国家组织坚决地斥责那些野蛮侵犯人民权利的行为。
