How Psychology Serves Socialist Construction
Chen Darou

    Providing Scientific Arguments for Dialectical Materialist Philosophy

    Psychology is the science that studies the origin, occurrence, and development of consciousness and the laws of the process by which humans reflect objective reality. The study of consciousness and the process of reflection is not exclusive to psychology; historical materialism also studies these issues, and psychology must be guided by it. However, psychology has its own research objects and methods to distinguish it from historical materialism. For example, the study of social consciousness and its general laws of reflection belongs to the field of historical materialism and other related sciences, and is not the task of psychological research. The survey and statistical methods used in social sciences are also not the primary methods of psychology.

    Psychology studies the consciousness and reflection processes of humans as concrete social beings, primarily studying psychological activities—including human sensation, perception, language, thinking, attention, memory, emotion, will, and personality. From the perspective of Marxist psychology, all psychological phenomena are functions of the brain and reflections of objective reality. Psychologists use scientific methods to study these psychological phenomena in various aspects. They explore the origin, occurrence, and development of consciousness from the evolution of animals (from lower to higher animals) and the development of human individuals (from infants to adults); they explore how objective things cause the brain to reflect and produce subjective consciousness from various aspects of human social practice; at the same time, they also use new theories and technologies in natural science to directly explore the laws of the material entity of psychological activity—brain activity—in order to elucidate the physiological mechanisms of psychological activities. Psychology conducts research and exploration from various aspects, with the general direction of revealing the ultimate "secrets" of human conscious activity.

    Conscious activity, or human psychological phenomena, is an extremely complex spiritual phenomenon of mankind. The essence of spiritual phenomena and its relationship with material phenomena is the fundamental issue and disagreement in the long-term struggle between materialism and idealism in philosophy. This struggle and disagreement also runs through the field of psychology. Idealistic psychology believes that "psychology" is the "soul," which exists before or beyond matter. They use the high complexity of psychological phenomena as a fortress to promote mystery and superstition. Materialistic psychology, on the contrary, believes that "psychology" is an attribute of matter, and is "the highest product of matter organized in a special way" (Lenin). They use scientific methods to reveal the "secrets" of psychological phenomena, clarify the essence of various psychological phenomena, and clarify how humans reflect the objective world through brain activity. This thoroughly strikes at all kinds of superstitions and prejudices, and further demonstrates the propositions of Marxist philosophy such as "matter is primary, consciousness is secondary" and "consciousness is a reflection of objective existence." Therefore, Lenin believed that psychology is one of the basic sciences that constitute dialectics and epistemology.

    Solving Practical Problems in Labor, Education, and Medicine

    Psychology not only has important theoretical significance and role in enriching Marxist philosophy, but also has important practical significance and role in the cause of socialist construction. Since the Great Leap Forward, practice has continuously raised many psychological problems, requiring psychologists to solve them. For some aspects of the problems, psychologists have already started research, and have achieved preliminary results, which have played a certain role in promoting practice.

    In terms of labor production, improving labor productivity is an important task for socialist production and construction in China, requiring psychology to cooperate. Psychologists have assisted industrial departments in holding rationalization training classes for operations, and assisted factories in conducting research on the operational activities of workers in stamping workshops. From the series of complex psychological activities in labor operations, they studied how to exert the effectiveness of human senses and perceptions to make accurate action responses with changes in the production process. They applied the principles of rational operation and methods of action analysis in psychology to explore the principles of rational operation in stamping operations, such as the application of visual and tactile pre-positioning, coordinated operation with both hands, strengthening the rhythm of operation, and reducing redundant actions. They assisted factories in improving the operation methods of twenty kinds of stampings, making workers who were once considered "slow-handed" become "fast-handed." This research not only improved labor efficiency, but also reduced labor intensity. How to effectively promote invention and innovation is another important task put forward to psychology in the mass technological innovation movement currently being carried out in China. Psychologists believe that the process of technological innovation includes a series of extremely complex thinking activities, the effect of thinking activities depends on appropriate objective conditions, and the thinking activity process also has inherent laws. They preliminarily analyzed the experience of mass invention and innovation, used the principle of association in psychology and the method of "prototype" inspiration, and cooperated with technicians to propose various "prototypes" (i.e., sketches, models, and things that can promote invention) that can inspire workers' creative thinking activities, which greatly promoted the process of invention and innovation. Through the exploration of the laws of creative thinking, not only theoretically shattered the fallacies of bourgeois psychology that invention and innovation are accidental "inspiration" and "sudden realization" of individual geniuses, but also has important significance for promoting invention and innovation and the technological innovation movement. Accelerating the training of technicians is another major task closely related to the work of psychology. In order to cooperate with China's steel production increase, psychologists have conducted research on an important technology in the operation of converter steelmaking workers—"mastering the heat." In converter steelmaking work, workers have to judge the smelting situation in the furnace based on the subtle changes in the flame ejected from the furnace mouth, and then perform operations accordingly. This was originally a difficult technology to master. Based on the experience of veteran workers in watching the fire and the theory of converter steelmaking, combined with the principles of visual psychology, psychologists found out the relationship between the subtle changes in the color, brightness, and shape of the flame and sparks and the temperature and chemical reactions in the furnace, as well as effective observation and judgment methods. They compiled teaching materials and assisted workers in quickly training steelmaking apprentices, so that workers learned the technology of visual judgment based on flame characteristics to varying degrees after a short-term (seventeen days) of training. In addition, ensuring safe production is also an important task related to psychology. Because the occurrence of industrial accidents is closely related to human attention, fatigue, and misoperation, psychologists have assisted industrial and mining departments in conducting preliminary analysis and research on the causes of accidents, and put forward beneficial suggestions and measures for safe production. Psychology can play a role in labor production in many ways. Therefore, labor psychology will inevitably become one of the important weapons to improve labor productivity.

    In medical work, especially in the prevention and treatment of mental illnesses, psychology can play its important role. Since the Great Leap Forward last year, medical work has put forward many new tasks to psychology. Psychologists are closely cooperating with medical workers and are currently conducting experimental research on the rapid comprehensive treatment of neurasthenia. Before the Great Leap Forward, neurasthenia was always considered a chronic disease that was not easy to treat in the short term. In the past, the curative effect of simple drug treatment and physical therapy in hospitals was very poor. Psychologists cooperated with medical workers to apply psychological therapy while applying drugs and physiotherapy, collectively known as comprehensive treatment. They applied this comprehensive treatment method in schools, factories, and hospital outpatient departments, respectively, and conducted experimental research. A total of two hundred patients participated in the treatment. Under the condition that the patients basically did not leave their original work and study, they achieved a very high curative effect after a course of treatment lasting only four weeks: the condition was completely improved, and the cure and significant improvement accounted for more than 80%-82% of the total number of patients receiving treatment. Follow-up studies have proved that the curative effect of patients quickly treated with comprehensive treatment is mostly consolidated. At the same time, the treatment experiments and the patients' responses have proved that psychological therapy is an indispensable part of the rapid comprehensive treatment of neurasthenia. The psychological therapy methods currently used by psychologists in clinical practice are mainly a rational therapy in an awakened state, including: 1. Introducing knowledge about neurasthenia to eliminate patients' anxiety about the disease and arouse and enhance patients' confidence in rapid treatment; 2. Teaching patients specific measures to overcome the disease, and encouraging patients to actively fight the disease; 3. Combining the specific causes of each patient, helping patients analyze and reverse their incorrect understanding of the pathogenic factors, so as to establish a correct attitude. It can be seen from the treatment experiments that the effects of psychological therapy and drug therapy (injection of Nuphocaine and insulin, etc.) and physical therapy (application of electrical stimulation, electro-sleep, and acupuncture, etc.) are often combined and mutually promoted. Psychological therapy may play a greater role in breaking the pathological vicious cycle, improving cortical activity tension, and treating the causes of the disease. In order to explore the pathogenesis of neurasthenia, they also combined the investigation and analysis of the causes of the disease and the experimental research on the dynamics of the patient's higher nerve activity cortex during treatment. The effectiveness of psychological therapy in the treatment of neurasthenia has attracted the attention of the medical community. At present, many medical institutions have widely adopted psychological therapy in the treatment of neurasthenia, and have achieved higher curative effects. It should be emphasized here that the role that psychology can play in medical work is not limited to the application of psychological therapy in certain mental illnesses. Even in the treatment of general diseases, psychology also has an important role. In their medical work, doctors of various departments must not only deal with the problems of the patient's organism (body), but also deal with the problems of the patient's thoughts and personality. Doctors often encounter the "psychological effect" of patients when treating diseases, and the doctor's language and attitude will have a great impact on the patients they contact. Doctors who have mastered psychological knowledge and have some understanding of the patient's personality characteristics and psychological state can help in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases and maximize the effect of drugs.

    In educational practice, after the Party's education policy was announced in 1957, educators raised many urgent problems to psychology. In 1958, under the situation of the Great Leap Forward in education in China, the tasks put forward to psychology became even more numerous. For example, "the problem of the age of admission for primary school children" is one of the important tasks. Psychologists are currently engaged in research in this area. They cooperated with educators to conduct experiments in experimental classes for six-year-old children. They have already started to study the age differences between six- and seven-year-old children in mastering subject knowledge, mainly in mastering language knowledge and arithmetic knowledge, and attempt to provide psychological basis for the age of admission from comparing the age characteristics of six- and seven-year-old children in terms of perception, attention, memory, and comprehension ability in the learning process. Improving teaching quality and teaching efficiency is one of the major tasks in teaching. Psychologists have assisted teachers in studying the teaching of four arithmetic application problems in primary schools. They tried to break the original primary school teaching system, compiled teaching materials according to the characteristics of children's thinking activities, and experimented with teaching the basic knowledge of algebra in the fifth grade of primary school, and used algebra as a tool to solve four arithmetic application problems. The experimental results proved that the students' academic performance was good, and the learning time could be shortened. This is meaningful for improving the teaching materials and methods and the learning years of primary school mathematics classes. In order to implement the policy of "combining education with productive labor," some psychologists are conducting research on the psychological problems of students participating in productive labor, and some psychologists are exploring how to better combine the teaching of various subjects (especially physics and natural science classes, etc.) with productive labor, which is helpful for improving teaching effectiveness and promoting the development of students' intelligence. Accelerating the cultivation of students' communist ideological qualities is also an important task in current education. In order to cooperate with this task, some psychologists have studied the role of students participating in productive labor and the school's trial implementation of the collective food and lodging system in forming collectivist spirit. They analyze the factors that promote the growth of communist ideological qualities from people's social practice activities, provide effective cultivation methods, and assist schools in more effectively cultivating students into laborers with socialist consciousness and culture.

    Strengthening the Connection with Reality and Emphasizing Theoretical Research

    The scope in which psychology can play a role in socialist construction is very wide. The above-mentioned work in the fields of labor, medicine, and education are only a part of the tasks that practice has put forward to psychology and the work that psychologists have done or are doing. In addition, psychology can also play its role in national defense, sports, and art. Since the Great Leap Forward, practical activities in these areas have also continuously put forward tasks and requirements to psychologists. However, due to the strength of psychologists in China, many aspects of the work have not yet been carried out or have only just begun. It can be said with certainty that psychology has a major role in promoting socialist construction in all aspects. However, it cannot be denied that because psychology is still a relatively weak science in China, whether in theoretical research or in solving practical problems, it is far from being able to undertake and meet the basic tasks and requirements put forward to it by socialist construction, and therefore it still needs to greatly improve its level.

    To solve more important problems for production and construction, psychology must more deeply connect with reality. Practice has put forward many tasks to psychology, which has greatly promoted the development of psychological research work. The broad masses have created and accumulated many valuable experiences related to psychology in practice. Psychologists have the responsibility to summarize and improve them to better guide practice, and at the same time, this enriches the content of psychology. On the other hand, while strengthening the connection with reality, we should correspondingly pay more attention to the research of theoretical problems. The experience of psychology serving practice proves that: the more theoretical improvement, the better practical problems can be solved. Because the original foundation of psychology is relatively weak, the research on many basic theoretical problems still needs us to pay great labor. We should combine with the connection with reality, greatly strengthen research in this area. It should also be particularly pointed out that, whether it is the research on the basic theory of psychology or the connection with reality to solve problems for practice, we should fully pay attention to the application of the latest scientific and technological in psychology. Due to the high complexity of psychological phenomena, only by using a variety of methods to conduct research and exploration on it from various aspects can we better solve the problem. At present, the development of many new technologies and new theories in natural science has in fact opened up many possible new ways for psychological research. For example, the application of information theory, cybernetics, radio technology, electronic computer technology, etc. to carry out research on brain electrical models is not only of major significance for clarifying the material entity of psychological activity—the mechanism of brain psychological activity, but also, in turn, exploring the physiological mechanism of brain psychological activity can also provide help for the design of related cutting-edge science and technology (such as highly complex electronic computers used to replace certain functions of the human brain).

    In short, psychology, whose main task is to explore the "secrets" of human consciousness (psychological) activities, will have a very broad prospect for future development, and its contribution to socialist production and construction will also be huge. Psychologists should improve their theoretical level, and at the same time continue to strengthen the connection with all aspects of production and construction, listen to the calls of practice, draw abundant vitality from practice, arm themselves with the latest science and technology and theories, improve their work level, and carry out selfless labor, in order to better complete the many major and glorious tasks put forward by production and construction to psychology, make more contributions to production and construction, and promote the development of psychological science through such practice.

    心理学是怎样为社会主义建设服务的
    陈大柔
    为辩证唯物主义哲学提供科学论据
    心理学是研究意识的起源、发生、发展和人对客观现实的反映过程的规律的科学。研究意识和反映过程的科学不仅是心理学，历史唯物主义也研究这些问题，心理学必须以它为指导。但是，心理学有着自己的研究对象和研究方法，以区别于历史唯物主义。例如，关于社会意识及其一般反映规律的研究，就属于历史唯物主义及其他有关科学研究的领域，而并不是心理学研究的任务；社会科学所用的调查和统计的方法，也并不是心理学的主要方法。
    心理学研究的是作为社会具体存在物的人的意识及其反映过程，首先是研究心理活动——包括人的感觉、知觉、言语、思惟、注意、记忆、情感、意志和个性等。从马克思主义心理学的观点看来，所有心理现象都是脑的机能，是客观现实的反映。心理学工作者运用科学的方法，从各个方面去研究这些心理现象。他们从动物的进化（由低等动物到高等动物）和人类个体的发育（由婴儿到成年）方面，去探索意识的起源、发生和发展；从人的各个方面的社会实践活动中，去探索客观事物如何引起人的大脑的反映活动而产生主观意识；同时还运用自然科学上的新理论和新技术，径直去探索心理活动的物质本体——大脑活动的规律，以便阐明心理活动的生理机制。心理学从各个方面进行研究和探索，总的方向是揭露人类意识活动最终的“秘密”。
    意识活动，或人的心理现象，是人类极端复杂的精神现象。精神现象的本质以及它与物质现象的关系问题，是哲学中唯物主义与唯心主义长期斗争的根本问题和分歧所在。这个斗争和分歧，同样贯穿在心理学的领域中。唯心主义心理学认为“心理”就是“灵魂”，是先于物质而存在或超于物质之外的。他们利用心理现象的高度复杂性，把心理学作为宣扬神秘和迷信的堡垒。唯物主义心理学则恰恰相反，他们认为“心理”是物质的属性，是“以特别方式组织起来的物质的高级产物”（列宁）。他们以科学的方法去揭露心理现象的“秘密”，阐明各种心理现象的实质，阐明人如何通过大脑的活动来反映客观世界。这就彻底地打击了各种各样的迷信和偏见，并且进一步地论证了“物质第一性，意识第二性”和“意识是客观存在的反映”等马克思主义哲学的命题。因此，列宁认为心理学是构成辩证法和认识论的基础科学之一。解决劳动、教育和医学等方面的实际问题
    心理学不仅对丰富马克思主义哲学方面具有重要的理论意义和作用，而且在社会主义建设事业中也具有重要的实践意义和作用。大跃进以来，实践不断地提出了许多心理学问题，要求心理学工作者去解决。对于有些方面的问题，心理学工作者已经着手进行了研究，并且已经取得了初步的结果，对推动实践起了一定的作用。
    在劳动生产方面，提高劳动生产率是我国社会主义生产建设要求心理学配合进行工作的一个重要任务。心理学工作者曾协助工业部门举办了操作合理化训练班，并协助工厂对冲压车间工人的操作活动开展了研究。他们从劳动操作的一系列复杂的心理活动过程中，研究了如何发挥人的感觉和知觉的效能，以随着生产过程的变化进行精确的动作反应等问题。他们应用心理学中关于合理操作的原理和动作分析的方法，探索出在冲压工操作中应用视觉和触觉预先定位、双手协同操作、加强操作节奏性，以及减少多余动作等合理操作的原则，协助工厂改进了二十种冲压件的操作方法，使一向被认为“手慢”的工人变成了“快手”。这个研究不但提高了劳动效率，而且还减轻了劳动强度。如何有效地促进创造发明，这是我国正在开展的群众性技术革新运动中对心理学提出的又一个重要任务。心理学工作者认为，技术革新的过程包括着一系列极为复杂的思惟活动，思惟活动的效果依赖于适当的客观条件，思惟活动过程也有内在的规律。他们初步分析了群众创造发明的经验，运用心理学中关于联想的原理和“原型”启发的方法，与技术人员合作提出了能够启发工人创造性思惟活动的各种“原型”（即能促进发明的草图、模型和事物等），结果大大促进了创造发明的过程。通过了对于创造性思惟规律的探讨，不但从理论上粉碎了资产阶级心理学认为创造发明是个别天才偶然的“灵感”和“顿悟”等谬论，而且对于推动创造发明和技术革新运动有着重要意义。加速技工培训，这是与心理学工作密切有关的另一重大任务。心理学工作者为了配合我国钢铁增产，曾对转炉炼钢工人操作中的一项重要技术——“掌握火候”进行了研究。在转炉炼钢工作中，工人要凭炉口喷出的火焰的微小变化，来判断炉内冶炼情况，据以进行操作，这原是一项很难掌握的技术。心理学工作者根据老工人看火的经验和转炉炼钢的理论，结合视觉心理学的原理，找出对火焰和火花的颜色、明度和形状等微小变化与炉内温度和化学反应之间的关系，以及进行有效观察判断的方法，编成教材，协助工人对炼钢徒工进行快速培训，使工人经过短期（十七天）的训练就在不同程度上学会了根据火焰特征进行视觉判断的技术。此外，保证安全生产也是与心理学有关的重要任务。因为工业事故的产生与人的注意、疲劳和错误操作等有密切关系，心理学工作者曾协助工矿部门对事故发生的原因进行过初步的分析研究，并对安全生产提出了有益的建议和措施。心理学在劳动生产上能发挥的作用是多方面的，因此，劳动心理学必将成为提高劳动生产率的重要武器之一。
    心理学在医疗工作中，尤其是在精神疾病的防治方面是可以发挥它的重要作用的。医疗工作从去年大跃进以来已经向心理学提出了许多新任务。心理学工作者与医学工作者密切合作，目前正在对神经衰弱进行快速综合治疗的试验研究。大跃进以前，神经衰弱一向被认为是一种不易短期治疗的慢性病，以往医院中采用单纯药物治疗和物理治疗所得的疗效都很差。心理学工作者与医学工作者协作，在应用药物和理疗的同时运用了心理治疗，合称为综合性治疗。他们应用这种综合治疗法，在学校、工厂和医院的门诊部中，曾分别进行了试验研究，参加治疗的病人共二百人。病人在基本上不脱离原来工作和学习的条件下，经过为期仅四周的疗程，取得了很高的疗效：病情全部好转，其中痊愈和显著好转占接受治疗病人总数80％—82％以上。经过随访证明，用综合治疗法迅速治疗的病人，其中绝大多数的疗效是巩固的。同时，治疗的试验和病人的反映，都证明心理治疗是神经衰弱快速综合治疗法中所不能缺少的部分。心理学工作者目前临床所用的心理治疗法，主要是一种觉醒状态下的说理疗法，内容包括：一、介绍神经衰弱有关的知识，使病人消除对疾病的焦虑，唤起和增强病人对快速治疗的信心；二、教给病人克服疾病的具体措施，鼓舞病人主动向疾病作斗争的勇气；三、结合每个病人的具体病因，帮助病人分析并扭转其对致病因素的不正确认识，从而树立正确处理的态度。从治疗试验中可以看到：心理治疗与药物治疗（注射奴弗卡因和胰岛素等）和物理治疗（应用电刺激、电睡眠和针灸等）的作用，经常是相互结合、相互促进的。心理治疗在打破病理恶性循环、提高皮层活动张力和在病因治疗方面可能起较大的作用。为了探明神经衰弱的发病机制，他们在治疗中还结合进行病因的调查分析和病人高级神经活动皮层动力的实验研究。心理治疗在神经衰弱治疗中的效用已引起医学界的重视。目前不少医疗机关已广泛地在神经衰弱的治疗中采用心理治疗的方法，并也都已取得了较高的疗效。这里需要强调说明的是，心理学在医疗工作中能发挥的作用并不限于在某些精神疾病中应用心理治疗。就以一般疾病的治疗而论，心理学也有着重要的作用。各科医生在他们的医疗工作中，不仅要处理病人的有机体（身体）上的问题，也要处理病人的思想上和个性上的问题。医生在进行治病时常会遇到病人的“心理作用”，医生的语言和态度对他们所接触的病人会起很大的影响。医生掌握了心理学的知识，对病人的性格特点和心理状态有所了解，对于疾病的诊断、治疗以及发挥药物的最大效果是有所帮助的。
    在教育实践中，1957年党的教育方针公布以后，教育工作者即向心理学提出了许多迫待解决的问题。1958年在我国教育大跃进的形势下，向心理学提出的任务就更加多了。例如，“小学儿童入学年龄的问题”就是其中的重要任务之一。目前心理学工作者正在从事这方面的研究。他们与教育工作者协作，举办了六岁儿童入学实验班进行试验。他们已经着手研究六、七岁儿童在掌握学科知识上，主要是在掌握语文知识和算术知识上的年龄差异，企图从比较六、七岁儿童在学习过程中的知觉、注意、记忆和理解能力等方面的年龄特征方面，对入学年龄问题提供心理学上的根据。提高教学质量和教学效率，这是教学上的重大任务之一。心理学工作者曾协助教师研究了关于小学算术四则应用题的教学问题。他们试图打破原有小学教学的体系，根据儿童思惟活动的特点，自行编写教材，在小学五年级中试验教授代数的基本知识，并以代数为工具来解决算术四则应用题。试验结果证明，学生学习成绩良好，而且可以缩短学习时间。这对改进小学数学课的教材教法和学习年限是有意义的。为了贯彻“教育与生产劳动相结合”的方针，有些心理学工作者正在进行学生关于参加生产劳动的心理学问题的研究，有些心理学工作者正在探索各科教学（尤其是物理课和自然课等）如何更好地结合生产劳动，这对提高教学效果、促进学生智能发展是有帮助的。加速培养学生的共产主义思想品质，这也是当前教育中一项重要任务。配合这个任务，一些心理学工作者曾研究了学生参加生产劳动和学校试行集体食宿制对于形成集体主义精神的作用。他们从人们的社会实践活动中，研究分析促使共产主义思想品质成长的因素，提供有效的培养方法，协助学校更加有效地培养学生成为有社会主义觉悟、有文化的劳动者。
    加强联系实际和重视理论研究
    心理学在社会主义建设中能发挥作用的范围是很广的。上面所举在劳动、医学和教育实践方面的一些工作，只不过是实践向心理学已经提出的任务和心理学工作者已经进行或正在进行的工作的一部分。除此之外，在国防、体育、艺术事业中，心理学也同样可以发挥它的作用。大跃进以来，这些方面的实践活动也已经不断地向心理学工作者提出了任务和要求。但是，由于我国心理学工作者力量的关系，许多方面的工作目前还没有进行或仅仅开始进行。可以肯定地说，心理学对于推动社会主义各个方面的建设实践是有它的重大作用的。但是，不能否认，由于心理学在我国目前还是一门比较薄弱的科学，所以不论是在理论研究方面还是在解决实际问题方面，它还远远不能承担和满足社会主义建设对它所提出的基本任务和要求，因而还需要大力提高自己的水平。
    要为生产建设解决更为重大的问题，心理学就必须更加深入地联系实际。实践向心理学提出了许多任务，大大地推动了心理学研究工作的开展。广大群众在实践中创造和积累了许多有关心理学的宝贵经验，心理学工作者有责任把它们加以总结和提高以更好地指导实践，同时这也就丰富了心理学的内容。另一方面，在加强联系实际的同时，应该相应地更加重视理论问题的研究。从心理学为实践服务的经验证明：理论更加提高，实际问题也才能解决得更好。由于心理学原有基础比较薄弱，对许多基本理论问题的研究还有待于我们付出巨大的劳动。我们应当结合联系实际，大大地加强这方面的研究。还应该特别提出的是，不管是对心理学基本理论的研究还是联系实际为实践解决问题，都应该充分注意最新科学技术在心理学中的应用。由于心理现象的高度复杂性，所以只有运用多种多样的方法从各个方面来对它进行研究和摸索，才能更好地解决问题。目前，自然科学许多新技术新理论的发展，事实上已经为心理学的研究工作开辟了不少可能的新的途径。例如，应用信息论、控制论及无线电技术、电子计算技术等开展关于脑电模的研究，不但对阐明心理活动的物质本体——大脑心理活动的机制具有主要意义，而且反过来探明了大脑的心理活动的生理机制，对于有关尖端科学技术（例如用以代替人脑某些机能的高度复杂的电子计算机等）的设计也可以提供帮助。
    总之，以探讨人类意识（心理）活动的“秘密”为主要任务的心理学，未来发展的远景将是非常宽广的，它能为社会主义生产建设做出的贡献也将是巨大的。心理学工作者应该提高理论水平，同时要继续加强与各方面生产建设的联系，倾听实践的呼声，从实践中吸取充沛的生命力，用最新的科学技术和理论来武装自己，提高工作水平，进行忘我的劳动，以更好地完成生产建设对心理学提出的许多重大的光荣的任务，为生产建设做出更多的贡献，并通过这样的实践推动心理科学的发展。
