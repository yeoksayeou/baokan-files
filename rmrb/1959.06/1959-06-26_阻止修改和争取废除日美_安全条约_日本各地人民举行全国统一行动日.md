Xinhua News Agency, June 25th, Tokyo dispatch: The Japanese people today simultaneously launched a massive third national unified action across the country to prevent the revision and strive for the abolition of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

　　Workers in more than twenty industries across the country held strikes and rallies today, demanding the abolition of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Japan, and the removal of U.S. military bases in Japan.

　　Coal miners held twenty-four-hour strikes in various locations. Printing workers, metal workers, chemical workers, dockworkers, transport workers, postal workers, employees of government agencies at various levels, public utility employees, and teachers held strikes and workplace meetings. Private railway workers, steel workers, miners, synthetic chemical workers, pulp workers, national railway workers, train drivers, journalists, and others also held rallies against the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

　　In major cities, tens of thousands of people also held rallies and parades.

　　Approximately 250,000 students from about seventy universities nationwide went on strike today, held student rallies, and participated in mass rallies and demonstrations in various locations.

　　Farmers who are currently fighting for the government to raise rice purchase prices and small and medium-sized business owners who are demanding government tax cuts also enthusiastically participated in the unified action in various locations.

　　In Tokyo, more than 20,000 people were divided into five areas—east, west, south, north, and Tama—to hold separate rallies and demonstrations, and then converged at Hibiya Park Music Hall to hold a massive central rally.

　　Xinhua News Agency, June 25th, Tokyo dispatch: Approximately 26,000 demonstrators gathered in Hibiya Park from various areas of Tokyo this evening to hold a central rally for the national unified action against the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

　　The procession, led by leaders of the Socialist Party, the Communist Party, and various mass organizations, was greeted by thousands of Tokyo citizens lining the streets as it reached the rally venue. The procession also included six hundred farmer representatives who came to Tokyo from many parts of the country.

　　The rally unanimously adopted resolutions and a declaration. The resolution demanded that the government immediately cease negotiations on revising the "Security Treaty" and abandon its plans to revise the treaty. It demanded that the government further abolish the treaty and pursue a policy of non-participation in military blocs, taking the path of peace, independence, and neutrality.

　　The resolution also demanded that the Supreme Court immediately release the innocent defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident" and expressed support for the Tokyo District Court's ruling on the "Sunagawa Incident," which declared that the stationing of U.S. troops in Japan violated the Japanese Constitution.

　　The resolution demanded that the U.S. government abolish the new criminal law enacted for the people of Okinawa and demanded that the Kishi Nobusuke government lodge a strong protest with the United States regarding this matter. It also demanded that the United States withdraw all troops from Okinawa and Japan and dismantle military bases.

　　The declaration expressed the determination to use all possible means to prevent the signing of the revised U.S.-Japan military treaty.

　　Koyama Ryoji, director of the political department of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), said at the rally that more than 2.5 million workers participated in today's unified action, including strikes; 120 local gatherings were held throughout the country.

　　Secretary-General of the Socialist Party, Asanuma Inejirō, General Secretary of the Communist Party, Miyamoto Kenji, and representatives of farmers spoke at the meeting.
