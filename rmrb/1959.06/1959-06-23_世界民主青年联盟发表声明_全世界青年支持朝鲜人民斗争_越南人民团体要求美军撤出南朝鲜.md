Xinhua News Agency, Prague, June 22nd: The World Federation of Democratic Youth recently issued a statement expressing that as the day of struggle for the withdrawal of US troops from South Korea and the reunification of Korea approaches, young people worldwide will support the Korean people and youth.

The statement said that after the complete withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea, the United States no longer has any reason to remain in South Korea. The statement emphasized that the US occupation of South Korea is the main obstacle to the peaceful reunification of Korea and a threat to peace in the Far East.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, June 22nd: The Central Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front, the Vietnam Peace Committee, the Vietnam Asian-African People's Solidarity Committee, and the Vietnam General Confederation of Trade Unions today jointly sent telegrams to the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland of Korea, the Korean National Peace Committee, the Korean Asian-African Solidarity Committee, and the General Federation of Trade Unions of Korea, expressing their firm support for the Korean people's just struggle for the withdrawal of US troops and all foreign troops from South Korea and for the peaceful reunification of Korea.

The telegram said that the Vietnamese people are very angry at the crimes of US imperialism and its lackey, the Syngman Rhee clique, in deliberately prolonging the occupation of South Korea by US aggressor troops, undermining the reunification of Korea, oppressing and exploiting the South Korean people, and threatening peace in the Far East and the world. The Vietnamese people firmly believe that the Korean people's struggle for the reunification of their motherland will achieve more and more victories.

Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, June 22nd: According to reports in local newspapers, the General Federation of Trade Unions of Iraq issued a statement calling on all trade unions and democratic organizations to support the Korean people's heroic struggle against the US occupation of South Korea.

The statement called on the Iraqi people to make June 25th "The Day of Struggle for International Solidarity and the Withdrawal of US Troops from South Korea." The statement said that the people's joint struggle for peace and against US-British imperialism is the only way to defend freedom and eliminate the danger of war.
