Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, June 14th. The Chinese painting exhibition, organized by the Pakistan Arts Council, closed here tonight.

Over the past eight days, approximately four thousand people visited the exhibition. Some people came several times, and they gave high praise to the works of the Chinese artists. Some viewers inquired about the names and addresses of contemporary Chinese painters in order to express their congratulations to them for these achievements.

Many viewers wrote enthusiastic words in the guestbook. One viewer wrote, "This exhibition clearly depicts the great ancient nation of China and its great people. It is not only the rich legacy of the Chinese people's culture, but also, I think, transcends this scope and expresses human genius." Another viewer said, "I was deeply moved after seeing your national art. I felt as if I was standing somewhere in China. Actually, I am not very interested in art, because I am a technician, but your artists have indeed forced me to feel interested with their brilliant art."

    在卡拉奇举办的我国画展览会闭幕
    新华社卡拉奇14日电　巴基斯坦艺术委员会举办的中国国画展览会今天晚上在这里闭幕。
    八天来，参观展览会的有四千人左右。有些人来看了几遍，他们对中国美术家的作品给予很高的评价。有些观众探询当代中国画家的名字和地址，以便对中国美术家的这些成就向他们表示祝贺。
    许多观众在留言册上写下了热情的话。一位观众写道，“这次展览会清楚地描绘了伟大中国这个古老的国家及其伟大的人民，它不仅是中国人民文化的丰富遗产，而且，我认为，超越了这个范围，表现了人类的天才。”另一位观众说，“看了你们的民族艺术，我深受感动。我感觉到我好像站在中国的某个地方。实际上我对艺术不很感兴趣，因为我是一个技术人员，但是你们的美术家的确用了辉煌的艺术迫使我感到兴趣。”
