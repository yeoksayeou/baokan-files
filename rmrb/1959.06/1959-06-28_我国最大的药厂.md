    China's Largest Pharmaceutical Factory
    The North China Pharmaceutical Factory is the largest combined enterprise in China primarily producing antibiotics. It was designed and built with the assistance of the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic during the First Five-Year Plan, mainly producing penicillin, streptomycin, vitamin B12, and medicinal glucose and starch.

    In the past, China relied heavily on imports for most of its antibiotics. Streptomycin, a commonly used drug in the treatment of tuberculosis, consumed dozens of tons annually. After the North China Pharmaceutical Factory went into production in 1958, its annual output of various antibiotics accounted for more than half of the nation's total antibiotic production. Now, domestically produced penicillin and streptomycin are sold throughout the country.

    To produce more and better medicines, the North China Pharmaceutical Factory is carrying out a mass movement centered on technological revolution and technological innovation. In March of this year, workers put forward more than 20,000 suggestions in just ten days. After the factory adopted these suggestions, all technical indicators significantly improved. In the second quarter, the average monthly potency (the effective ingredient in the fermentation liquid) of penicillin fermentation liquid reached three and a half times the designed target. The average monthly potency of streptomycin reached more than twice the designed target. If such indicators can be consolidated, it will be possible to turn one factory into several without substantially increasing equipment.

    The factory uses a wide variety of raw materials, and the quality requirements for raw materials are also very strict. At the end of last year, there was a shortage of raw materials supply, and they used indigenous methods and self-reliance to solve the shortage of raw materials. After several months of efforts, the factory implemented more than fifty major measures. The daily consumption of ethyl acetate used for extracting penicillin was reduced from four tons to two and a half tons, saving 550 tons annually. Diatomaceous earth used in fermentation filtration was replaced with penicillin mycelium and fly ash from power plants, ensuring production.

    我国最大的药厂
    华北制药厂是我国最大的一个以生产抗菌素为主的联合企业，它是第一个五年计划期间由苏联和德意志民主共和国帮助设计和建成的，主要生产青霉素（盘尼西林）、链霉素、维生素乙12和医用葡萄糖、淀粉等。
    过去，我国需要的抗菌素，绝大部分是依靠进口。链霉素是结核病治疗中普遍使用的药品，每年要消耗几十吨。1958年华北制药厂投入生产后，年产各种抗菌素占全国抗菌素产量的一半以上。现在国产的青霉素、链霉素已经行销全国各地。
    为了生产更多更好的药品，华北制药厂正在开展以技术革命和技术革新为中心的群众运动。今年3月份，仅十天的时间，职工就提了两万多条建议。工厂采纳了建议以后，各项技术指标都有显著提高。第二季度，青霉素发酵液效价（发酵液中的有效成分）月平均达到设计指标的三倍半。链霉素的月平均效价达到设计指标的二倍多。如果能巩固这样的指标，就能在基本不增加设备的条件下，使一个厂变成几个厂。
    这个厂使用的原材料品种很多，原材料质量要求也很严格。去年年底，原材料供应紧张，他们以土法生产和自力更生的办法来解决原材料的不足。经过几个月的努力，全厂实现五十多项重大措施。提炼青霉素用的乙酸乙酯日消耗量由四吨降为二吨半，全年可节约五百五十吨。过滤发酵时使用的矽藻土用青霉素菌丝和热电厂的炉灰替代，保证了生产。
