Starting from the Succession of the Yan School
Ma Shaobo

Recently, the Qingdao Peking Opera Troupe's Yan Shaopeng, Zhang Shaolou and other comrades performed Yan School (Yan Jupeng) famous plays such as "Giving Up Xuzhou" and "Wolong Mourning," which received concern and welcome from the capital's audience. This is truly gratifying.

People are not unfamiliar with the art of the Yan School. Yan followed old tales, and through transformation and development, formed the unique style of the Yan School, becoming a force on par with the new schools of Tan, Yu, Qi, Ma, Gao... which have arisen since the three major old male role schools of Tan (Tan Xinpei), Wang (Wang Guifen), and Sun (Sun Juxian) in early Peking Opera. The Yan School excels in singing. Yan Jupeng devoted profound efforts to the pronunciation of words and the execution of melodies. Mr. Yan Jupeng always emphasized "the melody arises from the word, and the melody is rounded only when the word is correct." Therefore, his pronunciation was particularly precise, his singing melody was rich, with ups and downs, twists and turns, and many changes. His rich vocal changes strictly obeyed the accurate expression of the word sound and emotion. His vocal condition was not very good, but his execution was round and peculiar, clear and pure, gentle and pleasant, and he was good at expressing complex and delicate emotions.

Mr. Yan Jupeng had a wide range of plays. Initially, he studied Tan School singing and performance with Chen Yanheng and Hongdouguan Master, and martial arts with the help of Qian Jinfu and Wang Changlin. He was good at inheriting tradition and had a strong creative spirit. He first went all out to lay the foundation, and then began to creatively develop his own singing method in traditional plays such as "Exchange of Sons at the Execution Ground," "Scolding the Emperor," "Ascending to Heaven," and "Prosperous Spring and Autumn," gradually forming the style of the Yan School. Famous plays of the Yan School such as "Giving Up Xuzhou," "Wolong Mourning," "Demanding Jingzhou," "Hatred of Annexing Wu," "Scolding Yang Guang," "Scolding the Emperor," "Scolding Cao Changting," "Ascending to Heaven," "White Python Platform," "Ying Tianqiu," "Suppressing Tanzhou," "Entering the Palace Gate," "Battle of Taiping"... have been widely known for many years. Unfortunately, in the old society, the Yan School art had few successors. Since Mr. Yan Jupeng passed away in 1943, it has almost become a lost art on the stage!

Under the concern and support of the Party, the Yan School has been revitalized today, which is truly exciting! Shaopeng is the son of Mr. Yan Jupeng, and Shaolou is the daughter-in-law and disciple of Mr. Yan Jupeng. Yan and Zhang are, after all, successors of the Yan School and have a good foundation. Although they are still far from Mr. Yan Jupeng's artistic achievements, as long as they "return to the right path," inherit the past and usher in the future, the future is immeasurable.

The future is immeasurable, of course, not only in the performance of Yan and Zhang themselves, but more in the inheritance and development of the Yan School art and its wider spread. This requires Yan School successors and enthusiasts to earnestly carry out the work of excavating plays. From the actual situation, the Yan School must go through a period of recovery before seeking greater creation and development. The learning of Yan School singing techniques such as pronunciation, articulation, breath control, and melody execution, the collection and collation of scripts and performing arts, etc., still require arduous efforts. At the same time, concrete measures are needed to cultivate the younger generation of the Yan School. It is said that the reason why the Yan School was almost lost in the past is related to the fact that the singing method is relatively difficult to learn, and some learners retreated in the face of difficulties. If this is true, then it is necessary to eliminate this ideological obstacle. It should be clear that any excellent art is by no means unattainable; and no art is easy to master. The difficulty in learning is often due to the profound achievements in art. Therefore, we must inherit it, master it, and develop it. Like the difficulty of learning the Cheng School, the Yan School should oppose the attitude of avoiding difficulties and stopping at a superficial understanding. Young people should have the confidence and courage to climb the peak of art. For the art of the predecessors, we must work hard to learn, respectfully learn, and honestly learn.

From the fact that the Yan School has successors, one cannot help but think of the inheritance and development of excellent schools of various roles in Peking Opera. Taking the old male role as an example, from the early Tan, Wang, and Sun to the modern Tan, Yu, Qi, Ma, Gao, and Yan in the past few decades, the art of Xu Yintang, Wang Xiaonong, Wang Hongshou, Liu Hongsheng, Shi Huibao, and Wang Fengqing each had their own merits. Although they were not without influence on later generations, they ultimately had few or no dedicated successors. After Chen Delin and Wang Yaoqing, the female roles had new developments with Mei, Cheng, Shang, Xun, Xiao Cuihua, Ouyang Yuqian, Xiao Yang Yuelou, Zhao Junyu, Feng Zihe, and Wang Yunfang, each forming their own styles and schools. There are also many schools in the north and south for roles such as painted faces, martial male roles, young male roles, and clowns, some of which have many disciples; others have few successors; and some have even been lost long ago. In order to make opera art more prosperous, developed, rich, and colorful, we should resolutely implement the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend," vigorously promote the mutual competition of different characteristics of various opera genres, various excellent schools, and various excellent artists, and the cultivation and development of successors of each school, and further strive for "students surpassing their teachers" and emerge newer and more excellent schools. The older generation should pay special attention to cultivating successors of their own schools, so that excellent art can last forever. It is a great pity to have a "school" without a flow! The experience of the Yan School, which has been on the verge of extinction for many years and is now able to be revitalized, is worth paying attention to.

    从言派有后谈起
    马少波
    最近，青岛市京剧团言少朋、张少楼等同志在京演出了“让徐州”、“卧龙吊孝”等言派（言菊朋）名剧，受到首都观众的关切和欢迎，这真是可喜的事。
    人们对于言派艺术并不是陌生的。言宗旧谭，而又蜕化发展，形成言派独特的风格，与早年谭（谭鑫培）、汪（汪桂芬）、孙（孙菊仙）三大京剧老生流派以来的新流派谭、余、麒、马、高……成为并驾齐驱之势。言派以唱腔见胜，对于念字行腔，下过很深的功夫，言菊朋先生异常讲究唱法，一贯主张
  “腔由字而生，字正而后腔圆”，因而他的吐字特别精确，唱腔旋律丰富，抑扬顿挫，千折百回，极多变化。而他丰富的声乐变化，严格服从字音和感情的准确表现。他的嗓音条件并不很好，但是行腔圆而奇突，清而纯厚，娓娓动听，善于表现复杂细腻的感情。
    言菊朋先生戏路很宽，最初从陈彦衡、红豆馆主钻研谭派唱法、表演、武戏则得钱金福、王长林之助。他善于继承传统，又富有独创精神；他首先全力以赴奠定基础，然后就传统剧目如“法场换子”、“骂殿”、“上天台”、“鼎盛春秋”等剧开始创造性地发展自己的唱法，逐渐形成言派的风格。言派名剧如“让徐州”、“卧龙吊孝”、“讨荆州”、“吞吴恨”、“骂杨广”、“骂殿”、“骂曹长亭”、“上天台”、“白蟒台”、“应天球”、“镇檀州”、“宫门带”、“战太平”……等多少年来脍炙人口。可惜在旧社会言派艺术很少传人，自从言菊朋先生于1943年去世之后，在舞台上几乎成了绝响！
    在党的关切扶持之下，于今言派重振，真是令人兴奋！少朋是言菊朋先生的儿子，少楼是言菊朋先生的儿媳和弟子。言、张二位毕竟是言派传人，有很好基础，目前虽然去言菊朋先生的艺术造诣尚远，但是只要“言归正传”，继往开来，未来是不可限量的。
    未来不可限量，当然不仅在于言、张二位的表演本身，而更在于言派艺术的继承发展和更广泛的流传。这就需要言派传人和爱好者们认真地进行挖掘剧目的工作，从实际情况看来，言派必须经过一个恢复时期，然后再求更大的创造和发展，言派唱法如咬字、喷口、气口、行腔的技巧学习，剧本和表演艺术的搜集整理等等，还须经过一番艰苦的努力。同时，培养言派的青年一代，也需要有具体的措施。据说过去言派之所以几乎失传，与唱法比较难学，有些后学者知难而退也是有关的，果真如此，那就需要消除这一思想障碍。应该明确任何优秀艺术绝不是高不可攀；而任何艺术又都不是容易学到家的。难学往往是由于艺术上有高深的成就，那末，我们就必须继承它，掌握它，发展它。言派像程派之难学一样，应该反对那种避难就易浅尝辄止的态度，青年人应该有攀登艺术高峰的信心和魄力。对于前辈的艺术，要下苦功夫学，恭恭敬敬地学，老老实实地学。
    从言派有后，不禁联想到京剧各行优秀流派的流传和发展的问题，京剧界以老生而论，从早年的谭、汪、孙到现代的谭、余、麒、马、高、言数十年之间，还有许荫棠、汪笑侬、王洪寿、刘鸿声、时慧宝、王凤卿诸家的艺术各有千秋，他们虽然对后来者不是没有影响，但是究竟很少或没有专门的传人；旦角，在陈德霖、王瑶卿之后，有梅、程、尚、荀、筱翠花、欧阳予倩、小杨月楼、赵君玉、冯子和、王芸芳等各自有新的发展，形成自己的风格和流派，以及净、武生、小生、丑等行南北很多流派，其中有的桃李繁茂；有的则是后继乏人；有的甚至早已失传了。为了戏曲艺术更加繁荣发展丰富多采，我们应该坚决贯彻“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针，大力提倡各个剧种、各个优秀流派、各个优秀艺术家的不同特色的相互竞赛和各派后继者的培养和发展。并进一步争取“青出于蓝而胜于蓝”。涌现更新更多的优秀流派。老先生们应该特别重视培养自己流派的传人，使优秀的艺术长流不息。“派”而不流，非常可惜！言派多少年来的不绝如缕和今日得以中兴的经验，是很值得重视的。
