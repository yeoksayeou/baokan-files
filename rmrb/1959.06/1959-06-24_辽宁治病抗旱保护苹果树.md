Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang. The people's communes in Liaoning Province's apple-producing areas are fighting against drought and pests to strive for increased fruit tree production.

Liaoning Province accounts for 80% of the country's apple production. This year, since the beginning of spring when the apple trees blossomed, they have been continuously threatened by drought, canker, red spider mites, and various other pests and diseases, affecting the normal growth of the trees. In particular, apple canker is seriously harmful, affecting about 30% of the fruit trees in the province. According to estimates by relevant departments, drought alone will cause a 10% reduction in this year's apple crop.

Currently, in order to strive for a bumper apple harvest this year, fruit farmers in various places are doing everything possible and racing against time to fight drought and pests. They are promptly scraping and treating fruit trees with canker, and cutting off severely diseased branches to stop the spread of bacteria. To ensure that the fruit trees are well-fed and watered, fruit farmers are actively accumulating and applying fertilizer, digging springs, and repairing wells for irrigation. They are also mulching and compacting the soil around the fruit trees to preserve groundwater. After fertilization and watering, the growth of the fruit trees has generally improved.

Recently, Liaoning Province has had several showers, and the drought situation has been initially alleviated. Various communes have withdrawn some labor from the drought relief teams to strengthen pest control efforts. Many communes have established pest forecasting teams and pest observation points to understand the pest situation in a timely manner and eliminate pests promptly. Jiuzhai Commune in Gaiping County, based on the fact that there are many pests this year and insufficient pesticides, proposed using chemical pesticides on the "cutting edge" (July, when various pests are at their worst). The pesticides currently being used are herbal medicines collected by commune members from the mountains and boiled into liquid. After several experiments, the mortality rate of pests reached 80%. After spraying all 50,000 fruit trees in the commune, red spider mites have been completely eliminated.

### 辽宁治病抗旱保护苹果树

    辽宁治病抗旱保护苹果树
    据新华社沈阳讯　辽宁省苹果产区各人民公社与旱灾、病虫害展开斗争，争取果树增产。
    辽宁省苹果占全国苹果产量的80％。今年，从入春苹果开花以来，连续遭到旱灾、腐烂病、红蜘蛛等各种病虫害的威胁，影响了果树的正常生长。特别是苹果腐烂病危害严重，全省约有30％的果树受害。据有关部门估计，仅因旱灾影响，今年的苹果就要减产10％。
    目前，各地果农为了争取今年苹果丰产，正在千方百计、分秒必争地与干旱和病虫害斗争，对有腐烂病的果树都及时进行刮治，病情严重的把干枝砍掉，以制止病菌蔓延。为使果树吃饱喝足，果农们积极积肥、追肥、挖泉、修井灌水，并且为果树培土、压土，以保存地下水分。经过施肥、浇水的果树，现在生长普遍转好。
    最近辽宁省连降几次阵雨，旱象已初步缓和。各公社已从抗旱队伍中抽出部分劳力，加强灭虫工作。不少公社已成立了虫情测报组和虫情观测点，及时了解病虫害情况，及时消灭虫害。盖平县玖寨公社根据今年虫害多、药剂不足，提出把化学药品用在“刀刃”（7月份各种虫害最重）上。现在使用的农药，是社员们上山采集野生草药熬制的药水，经过几次试验，害虫死亡率达80％，全社五万多棵果树喷药后红蜘蛛已全部消灭。
