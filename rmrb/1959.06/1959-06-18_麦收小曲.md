    Wheat Harvest Ballads
    Ba Mu
      Winnowing
    He scatters pearls towards the blue sky,
    Hot winds blow away wisps of dust.
    Look, the golden wheat stacks fill the field,
    Obscuring patches of clouds.
    Who is humming a tune in the yard?
    Someone is praising the newly harvested crops.
      Threshing Machine
    Like a spirited animal,
    Roaring on the field!
    Opening its mouth, it can devour a thousand bundles of grain.
    In an instant, it spits out ten thousand bushels of golden pearls.
    Children clap their hands and praise:
    "This is an ox that doesn't drink water..."
    With it participating in the commune's wheat harvest,
    There's no worry about getting the grain into the granary.
      Harnessing Horses
    Dispatching the newly made cart,
    Harnessing the brown steed.
    With a slender bamboo whip,
    The swift horse can gallop across the land.
    The driver has no time for leisure,
    He's delivering a cart of new grain to the state.

    麦收小曲
    巴牧
      扬场
    他把珍珠向蓝天抛洒，
    热风吹走缕缕灰沙。
    看，满场金色的麦垛，
    遮住了几片云霞。
    场院里是谁哼着小曲？
    有人在夸刚收下的庄稼。
      脱谷机
    像一条性烈的牲口，
    在场上发出怒吼！
    张嘴能吃千捆粮草。
    霎时吐出金珠万斗。
    孩子们拍手称赞：
    “这是不喝水的牯牛……”
    有它参加社里麦收，
    粮食入库不用发愁。
      套马
    派出刚制的新车，
    套上棕色的骏马。
    凭一根细长的竹鞭，
    快马能驰骋天下。
    赶车人那有闲情玩耍，
    正把一车新粮交给国家。
