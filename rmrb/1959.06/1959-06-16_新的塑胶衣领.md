    New Plastic Collars
    The Luoyang No. 1 Garment Factory has recently successfully trial-produced a type of plastic collar.
    This type of plastic collar is soft, does not easily deform, does not fade after washing, and will not turn yellow from sweat.
    Using this type of plastic collar to make clothes is not only beautiful and durable but also saves cotton cloth for the country, saving one and a half inches of cloth per shirt.

    新的塑胶衣领
    洛阳第一被服厂最近试制成功一种塑胶衣领。
    这种胶领质地柔软，不易变形，洗后不褪色，染汗水也不会变黄。
    用这种塑胶衣领做衣服，不仅美观耐用，而且能为国家节省棉布，每件衬衣可节约一寸半布。
