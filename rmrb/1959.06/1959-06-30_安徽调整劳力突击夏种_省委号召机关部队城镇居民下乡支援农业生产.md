    Anhui Adjusts Labor Force for Crash Summer Planting
    Provincial Party Committee Calls on Government Organs, Military Units, and Urban Residents to Go to the Countryside to Support Agricultural Production
    Hefei Dispatch from our Newspaper on June 29th: After completing the rush harvesting of summer crops, people's communes in Anhui Province have reorganized their labor forces to seize the opportunity for a crash summer planting. As of June 29th, over 41.61 million mu out of the planned 52 million mu have been planted, accounting for 80% of the original plan.
    In order to achieve a bumper harvest of autumn crops this year, Party committees at all levels in Anhui Province, based on the principle that "early action is crucial for a good harvest in agriculture," have allocated 80% of the labor force to summer planting after completing the rush harvesting tasks. The Bengbu Prefectural Party Committee also held a meeting to specifically deploy summer planting tasks, criticizing the blind complacency of some people, and requiring a daily progress of over one million to 1.2 million mu, and extracting 70% to 80% of the animal power to focus on summer planting. Through such specific arrangements, the summer planting progress has been greatly accelerated. For example, after Sangjian Commune in Dingyuan County formulated a detailed rush-planting plan, the entire commune transplanted rice seedlings on 4,433 mu and planted miscellaneous grains on 9,565 mu within four days.
    During the rush planting, people's communes in various places also carried out large-scale labor and animal power cooperation. In the Fuyang Special Zone, people's communes have established summer planting professional teams, and organized labor cooperation on a large scale at the brigade level, according to the size and urgency of summer planting tasks. For example, twelve brigades of the Zhaoji Commune in Yingshang County adopted methods such as equivalent exchange of labor. Brigades with small rice planting areas extracted labor and livestock to support brigades with large rice planting areas. In the transplanting of rice seedlings and planting of sweet potatoes, the phenomenon of waiting for seedlings and waiting for land was overcome, thus completing the summer planting of 13,000 mu ahead of schedule. In order to speed up the rush planting, the Fuyang Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China recently made an urgent mobilization to the people of the entire district, mobilizing more than 3 million people (accounting for 80% of the labor force in the district) to participate in the rush planting. As of June 18, the daily progress of rice and sweet potato planting in the district has increased from about 200,000 mu to nearly 300,000 mu.
    During the crash planting, various places have generally established an inspection and acceptance system, put forward quality standards before planting, inspected during planting, and carried out major inspections after planting, to ensure the quality of sowing. (Han Guozhen)
    Hefei Dispatch from our Newspaper on June 29th: The Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently held a meeting of secretaries of prefectural and municipal Party committees, focusing on discussing the problem of insufficient rural labor. The meeting held that agricultural production tasks are very arduous, especially in July and August, when it is necessary to rush to harvest early rice and rush to transplant late rice, and the time is tight. The way to solve this problem is mainly to rely on people's communes to rationally use labor, vigorously carry out tool reforms, and reduce non-production personnel; at the same time, it is necessary to mobilize and organize a part of the labor force from the urban non-agricultural population as much as possible to go to the countryside to support agricultural production. For this reason, the meeting decided to immediately mobilize and organize a large labor force from government organs, military units, schools, factories, enterprises, and urban residents throughout the province to go to the countryside to work for two to three months to support the people's communes in doing a good job in production.

    安徽调整劳力突击夏种
    省委号召机关部队城镇居民下乡支援农业生产
    本报合肥29日电　安徽省各人民公社在完成了夏季作物的抢收后，重新调整劳力组织，乘胜突击夏种。至29日止，全省计划种的五千二百多万亩，已种完了四千一百六十一万多亩，占原计划的80％。
    为了夺取今年秋季作物的丰收，安徽省各级党委根据农业生产的“一早三分旺”的特点，在抢收任务完成后，均以80％的劳动力投入了夏种。蚌埠地委还召开会议具体布署了夏种任务，并批判了部分人的盲目自满情绪，要求日进度达到一百万亩至一百二十万亩以上，并抽出70％到80％的畜力，突击夏种。通过这样具体地安排，夏种进度便大大加快。如定远县桑涧公社订出详细的抢种计划后，四天内全社便栽水稻秧四千四百三十三亩，种杂粮九千五百六十五亩。
    在抢种中，各地人民公社还开展了劳、畜力的大协作。阜阳专区各人民公社都建立了夏种专业队，并根据夏种任务大小、缓急的不同情况，以大队为单位，组织劳力大协作。如颍上县赵集公社的十二个大队之间采取等价换工等办法，由水稻面积小的队，抽出劳力、牲畜，支援水稻面积大的队抢栽；在栽秧和插山芋当中，克服了秧等地、地等秧的现象，因而提前完成了夏种一万三千亩的任务。为了加快抢栽速度，中共阜阳地委最近又向全区人民作了紧急动员，发动三百多万人（占全区劳力80％）投入抢栽工作，至6月18日，全区已栽种水稻、山芋的日进度，已由二十万亩左右，增加到近三十万亩。
    在突击抢种当中，各地普遍建立了检查验收制度，种前提出质量标准，边种边检查，种后大检查，保证了播种质量。　（韩国珍）
    本报合肥29日电　中共安徽省委最近召开了地、市委书记会议，着重讨论了解决农村劳动力不足的问题。会议认为农业生产任务非常艰巨，特别是7、8月间，既要抢割早稻，又要抢插晚稻，而且时间紧迫。解决这个问题的办法，主要是依靠人民公社合理使用劳动力，大搞工具改革，减少非生产人员；同时，必须尽最大可能从城镇非农业人口中动员和组织一部分劳动力，下乡支援农业生产。为此，会议决定在全省各级机关、部队、学校、工厂、企业和城镇居民中立即动员和组织大批劳动大军，下乡劳动两个月到三个月，支援人民公社搞好生产。
