Oppose Dictatorial Tyranny, Oppose Colonialism
　　Latin American Revolutionary Situation is Raging Like Fire

　　(Dispatch from this newspaper) The Mexican newspaper "El Informador" recently published an article entitled "The Revolution in the Americas," commenting on the current revolutionary situation in Latin America.

　　The article points out that there is no country in Latin America that is not shaken by tremendous resistance and serious conflicts. Some countries, such as Nicaragua, are carrying out armed uprisings against tyranny. In other countries, such as Brazil and Argentina, the working people are carrying out large-scale continuous strikes. In a third type of country, there are disturbances and tragic conflicts between the military police and the broad masses of the people. Only the situations in Mexico and Uruguay are relatively normal. Our entire Latin America is seething.

　　The article continues, dictatorial regimes—which are opposed by this profound popular movement—are accustomed to attributing this movement to communism. However, what is happening in Latin America is probably not the work of communists. The article believes that at the forefront of resistance to dictatorship are liberals, conservatives, Catholics, Protestants, and men and women from all social strata. In all countries, the main actors engaged in the turmoil caused by internal economic difficulties are the working masses, and even some national bourgeois strata. Clearly, there is a revolutionary situation throughout Latin America. This is a revolution against the old feudal system, which still rules in many places, because only Mexico has completely destroyed it, but not all are like that. This is a revolution against militarism, which does not exist in Mexico and Uruguay, but exists in the rest of Latin American countries. And this is first and foremost a revolution against the chains of colonialism, which enslave and oppress the vast majority of people through economic and political means.

　　The article concludes that the current revolutionary situation is the twentieth-century nationalist revolution in Latin America, and this revolution is uniting into a unified liberation movement.

    反对独裁暴政  反对殖民主义
    拉丁美洲革命形势如火
    本报讯　墨西哥报纸“新闻报”不久以前发表了题为“美洲的革命”的文章，评论目前拉丁美洲的革命形势。
    文章指出，在拉丁美洲没有一个国家不被巨大的反抗和严重的冲突所震动。有一些国家，如尼加拉瓜，正在进行反对暴政的武装起义。另一些国家，如巴西和阿根廷，劳动人民正在进行规模广大的连续性罢工。在第三类国家里，骚动、军警同广大人民发生悲剧性的冲突。只有墨西哥和乌拉圭的局势比较正常。我们的拉丁美洲整个都在沸腾。
    文章继续写道，独裁政权——这种政权遭到了这个深远的人民运动的反对——习惯把这种运动归咎于共产主义。然而拉丁美洲正在发生的一切事情大概不是共产党人干的事情。文章认为，走在反抗独裁前列的是自由党人、保守党人、天主教徒、新教徒和各社会阶层的男女。在所有的国家内在经济困难引起的风潮中进行活动的主要人物是劳动大众，甚至也有民族资产阶级阶层。显然，在整个拉丁美洲是一种革命形势。这是反对旧封建制度的革命，封建制度还统治着许多地方，因为只有墨西哥彻底地破坏了它，但并不都是如此，这是反对军国主义的革命，在墨西哥和乌拉圭没有军国主义，但是其余拉丁美洲国家都存在。而这首先是一场反对殖民主义锁链的革命，这种锁链通过经济和政治来奴役和压迫绝大多数人民。
    文章最后指出，目前的革命形势是拉丁美洲二十世纪的民族主义革命，这个革命正在联合成统一的解放运动。
