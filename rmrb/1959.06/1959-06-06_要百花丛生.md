Beijing's many theatrical troupes are actively rehearsing and refining small and medium-sized traditional operas and "excerpt plays," promoting the slightest essence of traditional opera and the specialties of actors from various schools.

In the rehearsal hall of the Third Troupe of the China Peking Opera Theatre, actress Li Hui芳 is rehearsing the legendary comedy "Gifting the Book." In this play, she must transform into several different characters: initially a straightforward and cheerful young lady, then suddenly a tiger-fighting hero, and finally a frail scholar. This is truly a non-trivial "test." The versatile Li Hui芳 performs it appropriately and movingly.

The Beijing Peking Opera Troupe is further refining and polishing seven old plays with representative performances by Tan Fuying, Ma Lianliang, Zhang Junqiu, Qiu Shengrong, and Cheng-style Qingyi Li Shiji, such as "Huai River Camp," "Protecting the Country," "Seizing the Horse at the Stockade," "Yao Qi," and "Three Slaps." The China Ping Opera Theatre, the Northern Kunqu Opera Theatre, and some folk professional troupes are also preparing to once again process and rehearse a batch of well-honed excerpt plays and small operas.

    要百花丛生
    北京许多剧团正在积极排练、整理中、小型戏曲和“折子戏”，发扬传统戏曲中的点滴精华和各派演员的专长。
    中国京剧院三团的排演场里，演员李慧芳正在排演传奇性喜剧“赠书记”。在这出戏里，她要变换几种面貌：开始是性格爽朗的淑女，忽而又成为打虎英雄，最后又变成文弱书生。这真是一次不简单的“考试”。多才多艺的李慧芳演来得体而动人。
    北京京剧团正在进一步加工整理谭富英、马连良、张君秋、裘盛戎和程派青衣李世济等演出的有代表性的“淮河营”、“大保国”、“坐寨盗马”、“姚期”、“三击掌”等七出老戏。中国评剧院、北方昆曲剧院和一些民间职业剧团，也准备再一次加工排练一批千锤百炼的折子戏和小型戏。
