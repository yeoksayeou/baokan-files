Mihai Eminescu is a poet and prose writer well known in Romania. This year, June 15th, marks the 70th anniversary of his death. He was born on January 15, 1850, in a relatively wealthy landlord family in the Moldavia region of Romania. After graduating from middle school, he spent his university years in Vienna and Berlin from 1869 to 1874. At university, he studied literature and philosophy. After graduating, he worked as a teacher, supervisor, and journalist. Later, due to his extreme poverty, he spent a period of wandering life in various parts of Romania. He was familiar with the life of the people and paid attention to learning local dialects and folk literature.

Popularity, patriotism, and democratic viewpoints are the characteristics of his poetry. His works have had a tremendous impact on the development of 20th-century Romanian literature.

Eminescu's works are close to Romanticism. He wrote short stories, political essays, lyrical poems, and satirical works. In these works, he fully and skillfully ridiculed the decline of the feudal aristocratic class. His poetry is based on folk creations and is therefore deeply loved by the people and widely circulated among them. (Pi) (Attached picture)

    米·艾米尼斯库
    米哈伊·艾米尼斯库是罗马尼亚家喻户晓的诗人和散文作家，今年6月15日是他的逝世七十周年纪念。他于1850年1月15日生在罗马尼亚莫尔达维亚地区的一个比较富裕的地主家庭里。中学毕业以后，1869年至1874年期间，他在维也纳和柏林度过了他的大学时代。在大学里，他学的是文学和哲学，大学毕业后，当过教员、督学员和新闻工作者，后来由于他的生活非常贫苦，曾经在罗马尼亚各地度过一段流浪的生活。他熟悉人民的生活，注意学习地方话和民间文学。
    人民性、爱国主义和民主观点是他的诗的特点。他的作品对于后来二十世纪罗马尼亚文学的发展有着非常巨大的影响。
    艾米尼斯库的作品接近于浪漫主义。他著作有短篇小说、政论文章、抒情诗和讽刺作品。在这些作品中，他尽情地而且巧妙地嘲笑了封建贵族阶级的没落。他的诗是以民间创作为基础的，因而深受人民群众的热爱，在民间流传极广。　（丕）（附图片）
