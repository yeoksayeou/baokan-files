The socialist construction of North Korea has entered a new stage of development. Today, in our cities and countryside, the socialist transformation of the relations of production has been completed, and the roots of exploitation and poverty have been eradicated forever. Our country has developed from a backward agricultural country into a socialist industrial-agricultural country with an independent economic foundation.

In the five years after the war, the total industrial output value of our country increased at an average annual rate of 42%. The industrial production in 1958 increased four times compared to the pre-war year of 1949.

The total grain output last year increased 1.4 times compared to 1949, and the material and technical foundation of agriculture has been further consolidated.

Because we have established a strong heavy and light industrial base, today the material and production foundation of our socialism is more solid.

All of this is the result of the correct economic line established by our Party Central Committee, headed by Comrade Kim Il-sung, to prioritize the development of heavy industry while simultaneously developing light industry and agriculture, and the correct organization and mobilization of the masses to implement this line; it is the result of the heroic labor struggle carried out by the working people of our country under the leadership of the Party.

One of the most important achievements we have made in socialist construction is the creation of our own machine manufacturing industry, which has laid the technical foundation for the people's economy. This is a reliable guarantee for further promoting the socialist construction of our country.

As everyone knows, in the past, as a result of the long-term colonial rule of Japanese imperialism, the Korean economy was in an extremely backward state, and the industry had extreme colonial imbalances, with the machine manufacturing industry being almost blank. In the total industrial output value in 1944, the proportion of machine manufacturing and metal processing industries only accounted for 1.6%. The scale of the factories was extremely small, and the technical equipment was extremely backward. Moreover, most of this weak machine manufacturing industry was located in South Korea. When the Japanese imperialists fled, they also carried out cruel destruction.

Under such circumstances, after liberation, the arduous historical task facing the Korean people who began to resume construction was to overcome the colonial imbalances in the people's economy and lay the independent foundation of the people's economy.

In the difficult situation of factories and enterprises being destroyed and machines and raw materials being lacking, in order to quickly restore the people's economy, it was necessary to quickly increase the production of machines and machine parts. Proceeding from this actual situation, the creation and strengthening of the machine manufacturing industry became one of the most arduous and important issues to guarantee the development of the people's economy and lay its independent foundation.

After liberation, our Party and government have always paid great attention to the development of the machine manufacturing industry. From the following table, we can see that the government's investment in the machine manufacturing industry has been increasing rapidly year by year:

    Year　　　　　　　　Increase Ratio
    1947   　　　　　　　100%
    1948　　 　　　　　　327%
    1949　　   　　　　　596%

As early as the peaceful construction period after liberation, our country built six new modern mechanical factories, and restored and expanded six mechanical factories and shipyards. Therefore, our country was able to produce various metallurgical equipment, equipment and parts for the mining and light industry sectors, etc., that could not be produced in the past, and built freighters with a tonnage of 2,000 tons, etc. In 1949, the proportion of machine manufacturing and metal processing industries in the total industrial output value increased to 8.1%. This is of great significance for strengthening the material and technical foundation of our industry.

During the difficult period of the Fatherland Liberation War, the Korean Workers' Party, with a long-term perspective, took a series of measures to ensure that our country's machine industry production could not only maintain the pre-war level during the war, but also increase year by year. In 1953, the proportion of the machine industry in the total industrial output value increased to 15.3%. This is one of the important foundations we laid during the war for post-war recovery and construction.

The general line for developing the economy put forward by our Party after the war was: not to simply restore the damaged people's economy to its original state, but in order to overcome the colonial imbalances left over by Japanese rule and lay the foundation for our country's socialist industrialization, to ensure the priority development of heavy industry, and at the same time, in order to stabilize and improve the people's lives that had been damaged by the war, to quickly restore and develop light industry and agriculture. Under the conditions that everything was destroyed and materials were lacking, it was a complex and arduous task to rapidly restore and develop light industry and agriculture together with the development of heavy industry.

As Comrade Kim Il-sung pointed out, in order to realize this arduous task, the Party, when deciding its economic policy, believed that the key to solving all these problems was to first rely on the indomitable fighting spirit and endless creative power of the working people of our country, who had been tested in the war and further united around the Party, and also estimated the economic and technical assistance of the people of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China and other brother countries, and first restore and develop the heavy industry sectors that still had a certain foundation in our country even after being severely damaged.

Our Party attached special importance to the development of the heart of heavy industry—the machine manufacturing industry—and paid great attention to the new construction, restoration, and technical personnel training of machinery factories.

Due to the Party's correct policies and the leadership of the Party Central Committee, our country's machine manufacturing industry developed rapidly during the three-year plan for the recovery and development of the people's economy after the war. We newly built the Huichon Machine Tool Factory, Huichon Precision Machinery Factory, Tokchon Automobile Parts Factory, Unsan Tool Factory, Kusan Mining Machinery Factory, Kiyang Machinery Factory, Pyongyang Precision Machinery Factory, etc., which are equipped with modern technology, and restored and expanded the damaged Bukchung Machinery Factory, Ragwon Machinery Factory, Ryongsong Machinery Factory, Taean Electric Factory, and shipyards in various places. At the same time, as early as the beginning of the war, our government sent many students and interns to study in the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other fraternal countries, and trained many technical personnel in domestic universities, specialized schools, and technical schools in various factories to ensure that we could operate various modern factories ourselves.

In this way, our machine industry sector finally overfulfilled the three-year plan task by 58%. In 1956, the proportion of machine manufacturing and metal processing industries in the total industrial output value increased to 17.3%.

After the start of the first five-year plan, the direction of our country's machine manufacturing industry was: basically, to produce and supply ourselves with the machine tools, motors, mining machinery, construction machinery, agricultural machinery, ships, and processing equipment for light industry, as well as various parts, needed to further strengthen the technical equipment of the people's economy, focusing on manufacturing medium and small machines, while also producing heavy machinery and equipment.

The output value of the machine manufacturing industry and metal processing industry, taking 1949 before the war as 100, increased to 449% in 1957, the first year of the first five-year plan, and 597% in 1958. In this way, in the past two years, our country's machine manufacturing industry has produced and supplied a large amount of machinery and equipment to other sectors of the people's economy, such as large smelting equipment for restoring blast furnaces and coke ovens, hydroelectric generators, electric motors, high-voltage transformers, metal cutting machine tools, machine ships, and various agricultural machinery; and produced various daily necessities, supplying a large amount to the people's needs. We have also produced many new products, such as 4,000 kW hydroelectric generators, universal milling machines, radial drilling machines, automatic looms, internal combustion engines, automatic threshers, etc. In particular, last year, all the workers and technicians in the machinery industry sector, responding to the call made in the letter to all party members from the Ninth Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee, overcame conservative ideas and mystification of technology, and successfully trial-produced trucks, excavators, tractors, bulldozers, and electric locomotives for mines for the first time in our country. This shows that our country's machine industry has entered a new stage of development.

Today, we can basically rely on our own machine manufacturing industry to promote the technical transformation of various sectors of the people's economy. This is of great significance for our country to carry out a technical revolution. Relying on such a solid material and technical foundation, our country's economy has entered a period of comprehensive technical transformation.

Establishing a strong machine industry base is the base for our country to carry out a technical revolution. Precisely because of this, the Party now puts forward the fighting slogan "Steel and Machinery are the King of Industry" and regards the rapid development of the machine industry as one of the central tasks. This year, our country's machine industry's production plan task is more than 2.6 times higher than last year. This means that this year will exceed more than 60% of the level of the final year of the original first five-year plan—1961.

In order to victoriously complete such a huge task, all the workers and technicians in our machine industry sector are responding to the Party's call, giving full play to their creativity and enthusiasm, making every effort to improve equipment utilization, manufacturing many simplified production equipment, mechanizing all handicraft operations, actively creating and adopting various advanced working methods, and launching a hot production increase movement to improve labor productivity and product quality.

In addition, in order to train technical personnel, the Party and government decided to establish Pyongyang Mechanical University this year, widely run technical schools and worker schools, and take a series of measures to strengthen the creative cooperation of scientists, technicians, and workers.

Today, a greater upsurge in socialist construction has been launched in our country. Under the leadership of the Party, all the working people are advancing more vigorously in order to complete the first five-year plan more than two years ahead of schedule, that is, this year.

In his report on the tenth anniversary of the founding of the Republic, Comrade Kim Il-sung put forward a grand long-term plan: on the basis of actively promoting the technical revolution and the cultural revolution, in the next six or seven years, the output of important industrial products will reach the following levels: electricity production will be 2.6 times that of 1958, coal will be 3.6 times, pig iron and iron ore will be 9 times, steel will be 8 to 9 times, cement will be 4 times, chemical fertilizer will be 3.3 to 4.3 times, and textiles will be 4.6 times; grain output will increase to nearly double.

That is to say, our country's output per capita will be 2,000 kWh of electricity, 2,500 kg of coal, 400 kg of pig iron and iron ore, 300 to 350 kg of steel, 500 kg of cement, 150 to 200 kg of chemical fertilizer, 50 meters of textiles, and more than 700 kg of grain. As Comrade Kim Il-sung pointed out, "Completing this long-term plan will unprecedentedly strengthen our country's political and economic power, we will build socialism, and climb the peak of communist society that can be seen on the very near horizon."

In order to victoriously guarantee the implementation of this programmatic task, our country's machine industry sector faces huge combat tasks. In order to rapidly develop the metallurgical industry, it is necessary to solve large blast furnaces, various rolling equipment and other non-ferrous metal smelting equipment, large mining machinery and equipment, etc. In order to rapidly increase electricity production, it is necessary to guarantee the production of large generators and combined equipment for hydropower and thermal power plants. At the same time, in order to provide production equipment for the chemical industry that will develop rapidly, it must also be created and developed, and the heavy machinery manufacturing sector must be gradually created and strengthened. Not only that, the machine tool sector must continue to expand and strengthen, manufacturing large machine tools, and also rapidly develop the production of various agricultural machinery and shipbuilding industries that will realize rural mechanization. To this end, it is necessary to continue to expand existing enterprises, gradually transition them to specialized production, and build new factories, especially to build or strengthen departments that are weak in our people's economy.

The achievements that the Korean people have made under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party are tremendous. However, our tasks in the future are even greater and more glorious. The Korean people are galloping towards a bright future.

The brilliant achievements of the Korean people on the road of socialism and communism will contribute to further strengthening the power of the socialist camp and will further inspire the struggle of the Eastern people to build the great cause of socialism.

The great cause of the Korean people, who are solidly united in the socialist family headed by the Soviet Union and bravely advancing along the socialist road under the strong leadership of the long-tested Korean Workers' Party, is bound to be victorious.

    朝鲜机械工业的发展
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国机械工业相　崔载羽
    朝鲜的社会主义建设已经进入新的发展阶段。今天，在我国的城市和农村，生产关系的社会主义改造业已完成，剥削和贫穷的根源永远消灭了。我国已从落后的农业国家发展成为具有自主经济基础的社会主义工业—农业国家。
    战后五年来，我国工业总产值每年平均增长速度为42％，1958年的工业生产增长到战前1949年的四倍。
    去年的谷物总产量增长到1949年的一点四倍，农业的物质和技术基础进一步巩固了。
    由于我们建立了强大的重工业和轻工业基地，今天我国社会主义的物质和生产基础更加巩固起来。
    这一切都是以金日成同志为首的我们党中央委员会建立了优先发展重工业、同时发展轻工业和农业的正确的经济路线，并且正确地组织和动员群众贯彻了这个路线的结果；是我国劳动人民在党的领导下展开英雄的劳动斗争的结果。
    我们在社会主义建设中取得的最重要的成就之一，是创建自己的机器制造工业，奠定了人民经济的技术基础。这是进一步促进我国社会主义建设的可靠保证。
    大家知道，过去由于日本帝国主义长期的殖民统治的结果，使朝鲜经济处于极其落后的状况，工业带有极度的殖民地不平衡性，机器制造工业几乎等于空白。在1944年的工业总产值中，机器制造和金属加工工业的比重只占1.6％。工厂的规模极小，技术装备极为落后。而且，这样微弱的机器制造工业，大部分都在南朝鲜。当日本帝国主义者逃走的时候，还进行了残酷的破坏。
    在这种情况下，解放以后，摆在开始恢复建设的朝鲜人民面前的艰巨的历史性任务，就是克服人民经济中的殖民地不平衡性，奠定人民经济的自主基础。
    在工厂企业被破坏、机器和原料缺乏的艰苦情况下，要迅速恢复人民经济，首先就得迅速增加机器和机器零件的生产。从这种实际情形出发，机器制造工业的创建和加强，成为保证我国人民经济发展和奠定它的自主基础的最艰巨而重要的问题之一。
    解放后，我们党和政府对机器制造工业的发展，经常予以巨大的关心。从下表可以看到，政府对机械制造工业的投资额逐年迅速增加：
    年度　　　　　　　　增加比例
    1947   　　　　　　　100％
    1948　　 　　　　　　327％
    1949　　   　　　　　596％
    早在解放后和平建设时期，我国就新建了六所现代化的机械工厂，恢复和扩建了六所机械工厂和造船厂。因此，我国能够生产过去不能生产的各种冶金设备、采矿和轻工业部门的设备和零件等，并建造了二千吨位的货轮等。1949年，在工业总产值中，机器制造和金属加工工业所占的比例增加到8.1％。这对加强我国工业的物质和技术基础具有重大的意义。
    在祖国解放战争的艰苦时期，朝鲜劳动党为长远打算，曾采取了一系列措施，使我国的机械工业生产在战时不仅能维持战前的水平，还能够一年比一年增加。1953年，在工业总产值中，机械工业所占的比重增加为15.3％。这就是我们在战时为战后恢复建设打下的重要基础之一。
    战后我们党提出的发展经济的总路线是：不是将破坏了的人民经济单纯地恢复成原来的状态，而是为了克服日本统治所遗留下来的殖民地不平衡性和打下我国社会主义工业化的基础，保证重工业的优先发展，同时为了安定和提高遭受战争破坏的人民生活，尽速恢复和发展轻工业和农业。在一切都遭到破坏和物资缺乏的条件下，和发展重工业一起迅速恢复和发展轻工业和农业，是一项复杂而艰巨的任务。
    诚如金日成同志所指出的，党为了实现这一艰巨的任务，在决定自己的经济政策时认为，解决这一切问题的关键是，首先依靠在战争中经过考验、进一步团结在党的周围的我国劳动人民不屈不挠的斗志和无穷无尽的创造力量，还估计了苏联、中华人民共和国以及其他兄弟国家人民的经济和技术援助，并且首先恢复和发展即使遭到了残酷的破坏、但是在我国还有一定基础的重工业部门。
    我们党特别重视发展重工业的心脏——机器制造工业，对于机械工厂的新建、恢复和技术人材的培养工作，予以巨大的关怀。
    由于党的正确政策和党中央委员会的领导，在战后人民经济恢复发展三年计划期间，我国的机器制造工业有了迅速的发展。我们新建了用现代技术装备起来的熙川机床厂、熙川精密机械厂、德川汽车零件工厂、云山工具厂、龟城矿山机械厂、岐阳机械厂、平壤精密机械厂等，并且恢复扩建了被破坏的北中机械厂、乐元机械厂、龙城机械厂、大安电气厂和各地的造船厂等。同时，早在战争开始时期，我国政府就派遣了许多留学生和实习生到苏联、中华人民共和国等各兄弟国家学习，并在国内各大学、专门学校和各工厂的技术学校培养了许多技术人材，以保证我们自己能够经营各种现代化的工厂。
    这样，我国机械工业部门终于超额58％完成了三年计划的任务。1956年，在工业总产值中，机器制造和金属加工工业所占的比重增加到17.3％。
    开始执行第一个五年计划后，我国机器制造工业的方针是：基本上自己生产供应进一步加强人民经济的技术装备所需要的工作母机、电机、矿山机器、建设机器、农业机器、船舶和轻工业用的加工设备以及各种零件等，着重制造中小型机器，同时生产重型机器和设备。
    机器制造工业和金属加工工业的产值，如以战前1949年为一百，第一个五年计划的第一年——1957年增长到449％，1958年增长到597％。这样，在过去两年中，我国机器制造工业就生产和供应了人民经济其它部门以大量的机器和设备，如恢复高炉和炼焦炉用的大型冶炼设备、水力发电机、电动机、高压变压器、金属切削机床、机器船和各种农业机械等；并生产了各种日用必需品，大量供应人民需要。我们还生产了许多新产品，如四千瓩水力发电机、万能铣床、摇臂钻床、自动织布机、内燃机、自动脱谷机等。特别是去年，机械工业部门的全体工人和技术人员，响应党中央委员会九月全会给全体党员的信中所提出的号召，克服了保守思想和对技术的神秘主义，在我国第一次试制成功载重汽车、挖土机、拖拉机、推土机和矿山用电气机车等。这表明我国机械工业已进入了一个新的发展阶段。
    今天，我们基本上可以依靠自己的机器制造工业促进人民经济各部门的技术改造了。这对我国进行技术革命是有着巨大意义的。依靠这样牢固的物质和技术基础，我国经济已经进入全面技术改造的时期。
    建立强大的机械工业基地，是我国进行技术革命的根据地。正因为这样，党现在提出“钢铁和机械是工业之王”的战斗口号，把迅速发展机械工业作为中心任务之一。今年，我国机械工业省生产计划的任务，比去年增加二点六倍以上。这就是说，今年将超过原定第一个五年计划的最后一年——1961年水平的60％以上。
    为了胜利完成这样庞大的任务，我们机械工业部门的全体工人和技术人员，正在响应党的号召，发挥最大的创造性和积极性，千方百计地提高设备利用率，制造许多简化的生产设备，把一切手工业式的作业机械化，积极创造和采用各种先进工作方法，为提高劳动生产率和提高产品质量而展开热火朝天的增产运动。
    另外，党和政府为了培养技术人材，决定在今年建立平壤机械大学，广泛举办技术学校和勤劳者学校，并采取一系列的措施，加强科学家、技术人员和工人的创造性协作。
    今天，我国的社会主义建设掀起了更大的高潮。全体劳动人民在党的领导下，为了把第一个五年计划提前两年以上，即在今年完成而更有力地前进着。
    金日成同志在共和国建国十周年的报告中提出了宏伟的远景计划：在积极促进技术革命和文化革命的基础上，在今后的六、七年内，使重要工业品产量达到下面的水平：电力生产为1958年的二点六倍，煤炭为三点六倍，生铁和铁矿砂为九倍，钢铁为八到九倍，水泥为四倍，化学肥料为三点三倍到四点三倍，纺织品为四点六倍；谷物产量将增长到近两倍。
    这就是说，我国按人口平均计算的产量，电力为二千度，煤炭为二千五百公斤，生铁和铁矿砂为四百公斤，钢为三百到三百五十公斤，水泥为五百公斤，化学肥料为一百五十到二百公斤，纺织品为五十公尺，谷物为七百公斤以上。正如金日成同志指出的，“完成这一远景计划，我国的政治和经济威力将空前加强，我们将建成社会主义，并攀登上可以在很近的地平线上眺望的共产主义社会的高峰。”
    为了胜利地保证这一纲领性任务的执行，我国机械工业部门面临着巨大的战斗任务。为了迅速发展冶金工业，必须解决大型高炉、各种压延设备以及其他有色金属冶炼设备、大型矿山机器和设备等。为了迅速增加电力生产，必须保证生产大型发电机和火力发电机等水力和火力发电厂的综合设备。同时，为了给将要迅速发展的化学工业以生产设备，也必须予以创设和发展，并逐渐创设和加强重型机器制造部门。不但如此，工作机械部门还要继续扩大和加强，制造大型工作机床，还要迅速发展实现农村机械化的各种农业机器的生产和船舶工业。为此，需要继续扩大现有的企业，使它逐步过渡到专门生产，要建设新的工厂，特别是要建设或加强为满足我们人民经济当中基础薄弱的部门。
    朝鲜人民在朝鲜劳动党的领导下，已经取得的成就是巨大的。但是，今后我们的任务还更巨大、更光辉灿烂。朝鲜人民正在快马加鞭向着辉煌的未来继续前进。
    朝鲜人民在社会主义和共产主义道路上取得的光辉的成就，将对进一步加强社会主义阵营的威力作出贡献，并将进一步鼓舞东方人民建设社会主义的伟大事业的斗争。
    巩固地团结在以苏联为首的社会主义大家庭里，在久经考验的朝鲜劳动党的坚强领导下，沿着社会主义道路英勇前进的朝鲜人民的伟大事业是必胜不败的。
