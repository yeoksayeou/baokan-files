Actively Seek Raw Materials
By a commentator of this newspaper

Paper is a cultural product, as well as a raw material or material for many industrial sectors. The more developed the socio-economy and the higher the people's cultural level, the greater the quantity and variety of paper required. In 1958, with the Great Leap Forward in China's economic and cultural construction, China's paper production also increased by 34% compared with 1957, a figure equivalent to half of the total growth during the First Five-Year Plan. This year is a year of continued Great Leap Forward in China's economic and cultural construction. In order to maximize the satisfaction of social needs, all employees of the paper industry need to continue to exert their energy and strive to fulfill and overfulfill the state-specified production plans.

Can this year's task be completed? From the perspective of production capacity, there is no problem. According to the light industry department's calculation of each machine, it can be completed without increasing production capacity. As for market sales, there is even less of a problem. The current problem is that the supply of raw materials and materials cannot keep up with the needs of production. This is a difficulty encountered in completing this year's national plan. It is wrong to deny this difficulty. However, this difficulty is not insurmountable. Take caustic soda as an example! Everyone feels that the supply is insufficient. However, recently, the Ministry of Light Industry, together with comrades from nine cities, held a meeting to study the results and found that the excess current and backup power during the low load of electric vehicles can be used to produce caustic soda, and it does not require much investment and equipment, only the installation of electrolytic cells. It is estimated that this method can produce at least 15,000 tons in the second half of this year, and even more if it is done well. With caustic soda, the problem of bleaching powder supply will also be solved.

Another example is the raw material for papermaking pulp, which is also currently generally felt to be in short supply, but it can also be appropriately resolved. There are many things in China that can be used to make paper, such as wood, bamboo, reeds, rice straw, wheat straw, sorghum stalks, corn stalks, bean stalks, melon vines, corn husks, sugarcane residue, rags, old cotton, and various thatch, etc. Currently, except for wood, bamboo, and reeds, none have been fully utilized. According to a survey conducted by relevant departments in Shanghai in eleven suburban counties, it is estimated that these eleven counties produce more than 1.8 million tons of rice straw, wheat straw, reeds, and various thatch annually. After deducting the amount used for fuel, feed, building houses, making straw ropes, and supporting other industrial construction, there are still 360,000 tons that can be used for papermaking. Thirty-six thousand tons of grass raw materials can produce 200,000 tons of pulp. What a considerable number! This kind of grass pulp can be mixed with other pulp in different proportions when manufacturing various types of paper. Now, various paper mills in Shanghai have already mixed grass pulp to produce various types of paper, and the quality of the paper is not bad.

Recycling waste paper is also an important aspect. At present, nearly 10 million copies of newspapers and periodicals are issued nationwide every day. If 30% of the waste paper can be recovered throughout the year, 700,000 tons of paper can be produced; even if 15% is recovered, 350,000 tons of paper can be produced. Using waste paper to make paper does not require alkali and does not occupy steaming pots, which can reduce papermaking costs and help solve the supply problem of caustic soda. In 1957, the paper mill in Liaoning Province was short of 3,000 tons of pulp to complete its plan. Later, the provincial party committee decided to purchase 5,000 tons of waste paper, and finally overfulfilled the plan. The Yanjing Paper Mill in Beijing has been using 30% waste paper pulp to make paper since the beginning of this year, and the effect is very good. The experiences of Shanghai, Beijing, Shenyang and other places tell us that actively opening up new sources of raw materials can increase paper production.

In addition to increasing sources of supply, there is also conservation. Since the beginning of this year, the raw material consumption quotas of general paper mills have been increased compared with the past. In the past, 800 to 900 kilograms of pulp were generally used to make one ton of paper, but now it has been increased to 1,000 kilograms or even 1,100 kilograms. Moreover, the distance between advanced factories, general factories, and backward factories is very large. The amount of pulp used per ton of paper in general factories is 10%-15% higher than in advanced factories, and the amount of pulp used in backward factories is 50%-60% higher than in advanced factories. If the amount of pulp used per ton of paper is reduced to the past level, or if it can reach the advanced level, the country can increase paper production by 200,000 tons throughout the year. Technology is progressing day by day. Why can't the level that could be reached in the past be reached now? Is it because the quality of the paper is better now than in the past, so the amount of pulp used has increased? It is not. Can this not be said to be insufficient subjective effort? Therefore, it is very necessary to focus on reducing the consumption quota of pulp. Of course, when reducing the amount of pulp used, it is necessary to pay attention to ensuring the quality of the paper.

From the above analysis, it can be seen that although there are some difficulties in the supply of raw materials and materials for completing and overfulfilling this year's papermaking industry plan, they are not insurmountable. The key is that we must correctly treat difficulties. On the one hand, we must see the difficulties and have a sufficient understanding of them. If we do not see this difficulty, or if we do not have enough understanding of this difficulty, thinking that the difficulties in the supply of raw materials and materials for the papermaking industry have passed with the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture in 1958, and that we only need to vigorously grasp basic construction and equipment in the future, that is wrong. Because this will make us relax our leadership in production, relax the organization of raw material and material production and supply, and ignore conservation, etc. On the other hand, we cannot exaggerate the difficulties of raw materials and materials and regard them as insurmountable. Otherwise, we will disarm ourselves in the face of difficulties and lose confidence in overcoming them. Now, wheat and early rice have begun to be harvested, and intermediate rice will soon be harvested as well. As long as we unify our understanding, despise difficulties strategically, pay attention to difficulties tactically, and under the leadership of the Party committee, vigorously organize the purchase of various usable grass raw materials, vigorously organize the recycling of waste paper, and vigorously reduce the consumption quota of pulp, we can completely achieve another Great Leap Forward on the basis of last year's Great Leap Forward.

    积极找原料
    本报评论员
    纸张，是文化用品，也是许多工业部门的原料或材料。社会经济越发达，人民文化水平越提高，需要的纸张数量和品种，也就越多。1958年，随着我国经济建设和文化建设的大跃进，我国纸张产量也比1957年增加了34％，这个数字相当于第一个五年计划增长总量的一半。今年是我国经济建设和文化建设继续大跃进的一年，为了最大限度地满足社会的需要，需要造纸工业全体职工继续鼓足干劲，努力完成和超额完成国家规定的生产计划。
    今年的任务能不能完成呢？从生产能力来看，是没有问题的。据轻工业部门逐台机器计算结果，不用提高生产能力，也能完成。至于市场销路更不成问题。现在的问题是原料、材料的供应赶不上生产的需要。这是完成今年国家计划中遇到的困难。不承认这个困难，是不对的。然而这个困难并不是不可克服的。拿烧碱来讲吧！大家都感到供应不够。但是，最近轻工业部同九个城市的同志开会研究结果，就发现了可以利用电车用电低负荷时的多余电流及其备用电生产烧碱，而且不要多少投资和设备，只需安上电解槽就行。估计用这种办法，今年下半年至少可以生产一万五千吨，搞得好的话，还可以多一些。有了烧碱，漂白粉供应问题也就随之而解决。
    又如造纸浆的原料，也是目前普遍感到供应不足的，但同样也可以适当解决。我国可以造纸的东西很多，木材、竹子、芦苇、稻草、麦秆、高粱秆、玉米秆、豆秆、瓜藤、玉米壳、甘蔗渣、破布、旧棉花、各种茅草等等，都可以造纸。目前除木材、竹子和芦苇以外，都没有充分利用。据上海有关部门在郊区十一个县所作的调查，估计这十一个县每年出产的稻草、麦秆、芦苇和各种茅草共一百八十多万吨，除去用做燃料、饲料、盖房子、打草绳和支援其他工业建设的以外，能够用于造纸的还有三十六万吨。用三十六万吨草类原料，可以生产纸浆二十万吨。这是一个多么可观的数字！这种草浆，在制造各种纸的时候，都可以按照不同的比例，和其它纸浆掺用。现在上海市各造纸厂已经掺用草浆生产出各种品种的纸来，纸的质量也还不坏。
    回收废纸也是一个重要方面。现在全国每天发行近千万份报纸刊物，假如全年能收回30％的废纸，就可以生产七十万吨纸；即使回收15％，也能生产三十五万吨纸。利用废纸造纸，不用碱，又不占用蒸煮锅，这既能降低造纸成本，又有利于解决烧碱的供应问题。1957年，辽宁省的纸厂，差三千吨纸浆就完不成计划，后来省委决定收购五千吨废纸，终于超额完成了计划。北京市燕京造纸厂，今年以来一直掺用30％的废纸浆造纸，效果很好。上海、北京、沈阳等地的经验告诉我们，积极开辟新的原料来源，就可以增产纸张。
    开源以外，还有节流。今年以来，一般纸厂的原料消耗定额都比过去提高了。过去一般用八、九百公斤浆造一吨纸，现在却提高到一千公斤、甚至一千一百多公斤。而且先进厂、一般厂与落后厂的距离很大。一般厂每吨纸用浆量比先进厂高10％—15％，落后厂比先进厂高50％—60％，如果每吨纸的用浆量都降低到过去的水平，或者都能向先进水平看齐，全国全年就可以增产二十万吨纸。技术是一天天进步的。过去能达到的水平，现在为什么反而达不到了呢？是不是现在的纸张质量比过去的好，用浆量才提高的呢？也不是。这总不能说不是主观努力不够了吧？因此，狠狠地抓一下降低纸浆的消耗定额，是十分必要的。当然，在降低用浆量的时候，必须注意保证纸张质量。
    从以上的分析可以看出，完成和超额完成今年造纸工业的计划，虽然在原料、材料的供应方面有些困难，但并非无法克服。关键是我们要正确地对待困难。一方面，我们必须看到困难，并且要有足够的认识。如果看不见这个困难，或者对于这个困难认识不足，以为1958年工农业大跃进，造纸工业原料、材料的供应困难已成为过去了，今后只要大力抓基本建设、抓设备就可以了，那是不对的。因为这样会使我们放松对生产的领导，放松对原料、材料生产和供应的组织工作，以及忽视节约等等。另一方面，我们不能夸大原料、材料的困难，把它看做是不可克服的。否则，我们就会在困难面前解除武装，失去克服困难的信心。现在，小麦和早稻已经开始收割，中稻很快也就要收割。只要我们统一认识，在战略上蔑视困难，在战术上重视困难，在党委的领导下，大力组织收购各种可以利用的草类原料，大力组织回收废报废纸，大力降低纸浆的消耗定额，在去年大跃进的基础上，再来一个大跃进，是完全可以的。
