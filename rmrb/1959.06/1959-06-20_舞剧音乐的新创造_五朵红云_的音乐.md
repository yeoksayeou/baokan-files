	New Creation of Dance Drama Music
	——The Music of "Five Red Clouds"
	Li Ling

	It is very interesting to compare the dance music from the First Literary and Art Congress of the People's Liberation Army with the dance drama music from this congress. Undoubtedly, there were many good programs in the previous congress, but the progress in musical creation demonstrated by the dance drama "Five Red Clouds" far surpasses previous levels.

	"Five Red Clouds" is a story depicting the heroic struggle of the Li people near Wuzhi Mountain in Hainan.

	The dance drama is like a beautiful poem.

	The dance drama music is the crystallization of this poem. It has almost completely departed from the situation of merely providing accompaniment for dance, and possesses the character of the plot itself. Even as a separate program (performing dance music alone), it can make people understand certain emotions and artistic conceptions.

	The dance drama music creates a poetic scene right from the beginning, with light and clear piano sounds衬托ing the beautiful scenery of southern China. Following this, the familiar melody of Wuzhi Mountain folk songs is used to express the Li people's love of peace, freedom, and their gentle and honest character. This requirement of using musical elements to portray specific emotions and characters runs through the entire drama. Although the overture music is a bit short, and the explanation is a bit hasty, the plot narrated by the overture, such as the Kuomintang reactionaries' cruel massacre and the image of the people finally finding the Party and achieving victory, can be felt.

	Dance drama music is the sublimation and destination of the emotions and artistic conception of the dance. In most cases, the story is conceived first, then the music is composed, and then the dance is choreographed based on the music. Whether the music is composed first or the music is added later, the characterization of the music itself possesses the essential spirit of the dance, providing the dance with rhythm and profound emotional inspiration. This is very important. The so-called "hearing the song and dancing" means that the music has a strong impulsive force, and as a dance drama, this requirement is even more necessary.

	The music of "Five Red Clouds," such as the "Lullaby" in the first act, the "Rice Pounding Dance" in the second scene, the "Uprising" dance music in the second act, and the music of "Initial Victory" and "Retreat" in the third act, are written with great distinctiveness. Here, the music is no longer "merely an appendage to the dance," but the soul of the dance.

	In the dance drama, there are several places where the portrayal of the characters' psychological changes through music is relatively successful, such as Ke Ying's painful feelings when she loses her husband and children, her inner sadness in the "Initial Victory," and the tune of the Li people's suffering, which repeatedly appears in the dance music, are all very touching.

	The dance drama music also has many relatively excellent aspects in terms of orchestration. The "Lullaby" uses the erhu as the main instrument, with deep emotion, and other instruments provide light and clear衬托, which is very effective. (This piece also has an effect when it reappears in "Initial Victory" later, but it is a bit thin, because Ke Ying's mood was more complex at that time.) The music in the "Initial Victory" scene is written boldly and cleverly; the whole song rarely has the bloated and cumbersome situation of instruments piled up in heaps like some dance music, and more attention is paid to the contrast between浓淡.

	Putting singing in a dance drama is a new attempt. I think it is not necessary to set the frame too rigidly, thinking that a dance drama must not have singing. The "Rice Pounding Ballad," for example, is very well written, with a novel tune and distinctive singing, leaving a deep impression. Secondly, the "Lullaby" can also intimately embody the young mother's love for her child, and the style is also unusual.

	Some songs lack strength, such as the solo in the first act where Gong Hu returns and recounts meeting the Red Army on the road (a section after the暗场), which seems relatively weak. Some solo and chorus songs later on have similar situations.

	I think this is not simply a question of whether or not to use singing. If the use of singing does not weaken the meticulous exploration of music and dance language, that is, if one does not become lazy (thinking that everything that cannot be expressed can be dealt with by singing), then the use of singing will make the dance drama richer and more profound.

    舞剧音乐的新创造
    ——“五朵红云”的音乐
    李凌
    把解放军第一届文艺会演中的舞蹈音乐和这次会演的舞剧音乐作一个对比，是很有意思的。无疑的在上届会演中，也有不少较好的节目，但是，像舞剧“五朵红云”所表现出来的音乐创作的进度，是远远地越过以往的水平了。
    “五朵红云”是描写海南五指山附近，黎族人民的英勇斗争的故事。
    舞剧像一首优美的诗。
    舞剧音乐是这首诗篇的结晶。它几乎已经完全远离那种为舞配伴奏的情形，本身就具有剧情的性格，即使作为单独（单表演舞曲）的节目，也能使人领会到一定的情绪和意境。
    舞剧音乐一开始就创造出一幅富有诗意的景象，由轻清的琴音，来衬托出秀丽的南国风光。随着以大家熟习的五指山民歌的旋律来表现黎族人民的热爱和平、自由、温厚的品格，这种通过音乐的因素以刻划特定情感和人物风貌的要求，几乎贯串全剧。虽然序曲音乐略嫌短了一些，交代也嫌匆促了些，但序曲所诉述的情节，如国民党反动派的残酷屠杀，以及人民终于找到了党，取得胜利的形象，是可以感受到的。
    舞剧音乐，它是舞蹈的情绪，意境的升华和归托。大多的情形是先拟故事，然后作曲，再根据音乐编舞，不管是先编曲或是后配曲，音乐的性格化，自身就具备了舞蹈的本质精神，从中给舞蹈以律动和深刻情感的启示，这是很重要的。所谓“闻歌起舞”，也就是说，音乐具有强烈的冲激力，而作为舞剧，这种要求就更为需要了。
    “五朵红云”的音乐，像第一幕的“催眠曲”、第二场的“舂米舞”、第二幕“暴动”舞曲，以及第三幕“初胜”、“退军”的音乐，写得非常有特色；音乐在这里早已不是“仅仅是舞蹈的附属物”，而是舞蹈的灵魂。
    舞剧中有好些地方，以音乐来描画人物心理变化比较成功，如柯英在失去丈夫和孩子时的痛苦心情，她在“初胜”中的内心悲伤，以及舞曲中反复出现黎族人民苦难心声的音调，都非常打动人心。
    舞剧音乐在配器方面，也有不少比较优异的地方，“催眠曲”采用二胡主奏，情感深厚，其他乐器作轻清的衬托，很有效果（这首曲子，后来在“初胜”中重现时也有效果，但嫌单薄一点，因那时柯英的心情更为复杂了。），“初胜”一场，音乐写得大胆、聪明；全曲极少有像某些舞曲那样，一堆一堆的乐器形成臃肿累赘的情形，对于浓淡对比，也较注意。
    把歌唱放在舞剧中是一个新的尝试。我想，也不必把框框定得太死，认为舞剧就一定不能有歌唱。像“舂米谣”就写得很好，情调新颖，歌唱也有特色，给人的印象很深。其次像“催眠歌”也能亲切地体现这位年青的母亲对孩子的爱情，风格也不一般。
    有些歌是缺乏力量的，像第一幕公虎归来追述路上遇到红军（暗场后的一段）那一段独唱，就显得较为贫弱。后面有些独唱、合唱曲也有类似的情形。
    我想，这不单纯是好不好采用歌唱的问题，如果不因用歌而削弱对音乐和舞蹈语言的精心探讨，也就是说不偷懒（即以为表现不出的都可以用歌来对付），采用歌唱，会使舞剧更为丰富、深刻。
