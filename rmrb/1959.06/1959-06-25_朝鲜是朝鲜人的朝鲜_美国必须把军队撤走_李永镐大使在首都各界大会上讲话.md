Xinhua News Agency, June 24th: The following is the full text of the speech by Korean Ambassador to China, Li Yongho, at the meeting: Dear Comrades:

Today's meeting commemorates June 25th, the day nine years ago when American imperialism launched the Korean War, as "The Day for the Withdrawal of US Troops from South Korea," and firmly supports the just stand of the Korean people in launching a nationwide struggle to ensure the early withdrawal of American imperialist aggressors. I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to you, comrades.

As everyone knows, due to the occupation of South Korea by American imperialism, our motherland, although it has been liberated for fourteen years, is still in an intolerable state today: the country is divided, and the people of our single nation are separated between the North and the South.

Since American imperialism occupied South Korea, it has consistently conspired to divide our motherland and implemented a vicious colonial enslavement policy in South Korea.

They have brutally violated international conventions on the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue and have responded to the legitimate demands of the Korean people for the peaceful reunification of their motherland by instigating aggressive wars.

The war brought unprecedented disasters and suffering to the Korean people. However, the American imperialist aggressors did not subdue the Korean people who rose up to defend the honor, freedom, and independence of their country; the cruel Korean War ended with the victory of the Korean people.

Six years have passed since then. However, peace in Korea continues to be seriously threatened, and the divided Korea remains ununified.

Due to the occupation of South Korea by American imperialism, the political, economic, and cultural development of the Korean people has been hindered.

Therefore, today, the northern and southern halves of Korea are following completely opposite paths.

Now, in the northern half of the Republic, where the people are masters of their own affairs, a vigorous peaceful labor is underway.

Through diligent and creative labor, the people of the northern half of the Republic have fundamentally changed the face of the country in a short period of time. The northern half of our country, which was originally a backward semi-feudal colony, has long become an industrial and agricultural country with a solid foundation of national self-reliance, despite the serious damage suffered during the war.

Last year, the industrial production of the northern half of the Republic exceeded more than four times the level of 1944 before liberation. Therefore, exploitation, poverty, unemployment, and hunger have long disappeared from the northern half of the Republic.

However, today's South Korea has become a horrifying living hell: the people have no rights, hunger is everywhere, and the real power of the fascist rule is in the hands of the American military.

South Korean industry has suffered extremely heavy damage. The number of unemployed and semi-unemployed people, reaching 6.6 million, wandering the streets is rare in any country in the world.

Fertile land is desolate and barren, and chronic famine has swept across South Korea. At the beginning of this year alone, 700,000 farming households were in a state of starvation.

Orphans roam the streets in groups, begging and dying; the South Korean people, struggling on the brink of life and death, face the threat of being sold to foreign countries to become slaves for American farm owners who get rich by using whips.

American imperialist beasts suppress political parties, social organizations, and individual activities that do not suit their tastes in a medieval manner and continue to arbitrarily massacre the South Korean people.

The misfortune and suffering of the South Korean people cannot continue.

Our Republic's government, for the peaceful reunification of the motherland, has successively put forward practical and feasible proposals such as the realization of North-South consultation and North-South economic and cultural exchanges, and has taken measures more than once to save the South Korean people who have fallen into the abyss of suffering. However, these legitimate measures have been stubbornly obstructed and rejected by American imperialism and the Li Chengwan (Syngman Rhee) gang every time, and therefore have not been realized.

Today, it has been a year since the Chinese People's Volunteers withdrew from North Korea, but the US military has not only not withdrawn but is also plotting to occupy South Korea for a long time, responding to the Republic's government's proposals for peace and peaceful reunification with war provocations.

They have expanded the Li Chengwan (Syngman Rhee) puppet army from sixteen divisions at the time of the armistice to thirty-one divisions, and have transported atomic weapons, established atomic bases, and recently conducted frequent "atomic mobile exercises," clamoring for "northward advance" and frantically preparing for war. They have also violated the armistice agreement and constantly carried out illegal intrusions and gun and cannon fire on the military demarcation line.

The aggressors, with the ink on the armistice agreement they signed still wet, are dreaming of playing with the fire of aggression again, and are further blatantly obstructing the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue. This is not only a serious threat to peace in Korea but also to peace in the Far East and the world.

The root cause of all this lies in the aggressive policy of American imperialism and the occupation of South Korea by the US military.

If the American imperialist aggressor troops did not occupy South Korea, the Korean people would have peacefully reunified their motherland long ago, and the people of North and South Korea would have long lived a happy and prosperous life together.

Korea is the Korea of the Korean people. The Korean issue must be resolved peacefully by the Korean people themselves.

No means of the American imperialist aggressive clique can justify the American aggressor troops staying in South Korea. American imperialism must immediately withdraw its troops from South Korea. This is the unanimous demand of the people of all peace-loving countries.

The Korean people understand that their just struggle to safeguard peace, strive for national reunification, and demand the withdrawal of US troops from South Korea is by no means isolated but is unanimously supported by the peace-loving people of the world.

The Chinese people, who have won victory in the common struggle against American imperialist aggressors and are fighting to safeguard peace in Asia and the Far East, resolutely and warmly support this just struggle of the Korean people. This support from the Chinese people has further encouraged the Korean people's strong will to fight.

Currently, in every corner of the major continents, the voices condemning the peace disruptor—the American imperialist army occupying South Korea—are rising even higher.

The Standing Committee of the World Peace Council, the Executive Committee of the World Federation of Trade Unions, the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Council, and the International Union of Students have also issued statements respectively, calling on the world to support the struggle of the Korean people. Peace-loving people all over the world are supporting the just struggle of the Korean people in this way.

Faced with the united struggle of the Korean people, the powerful condemnation of the people of the world, and just public opinion, the American imperialist aggressive clique should learn a lesson and immediately withdraw its aggressive troops from South Korea.

The Korean people, through their just struggle and the warm support of peace-loving people all over the world, will surely force the American imperialist aggressive troops to withdraw from South Korea.

The people of Korea and China, who are members of the same socialist family, resolutely defend their revolutionary achievements, jointly care about its expansion and strengthening, and oppose the American imperialist aggressors, must drive the American imperialists out of the southern half of Korea and Taiwan, China. We will forever stand side by side on the common front line of defending peace in the Far East and the socialist East.

Long live the unity and solidarity of the socialist camp with the Soviet Union as the core!

Long live the fighting friendship and solidarity between the people of Korea and China, which has been further consolidated in the common struggle against American imperialism! Long live world peace!

### 朝鲜是朝鲜人的朝鲜  美国必须把军队撤走  李永镐大使在首都各界大会上讲话

    朝鲜是朝鲜人的朝鲜
    美国必须把军队撤走
    李永镐大使在首都各界大会上讲话
    新华社24日讯　朝鲜驻中国大使李永镐在大会上的讲话，全文如下：亲爱的同志们：
    今天的大会，把九年前美帝国主义发动朝鲜战争的6月25日做为“使美军撤出南朝鲜日”来纪念，坚决支持朝鲜人民为使美帝国主义侵略者早日撤走而展开全民斗争的正义立场，对此，我向同志们表示衷心的感谢。
    大家知道，由于美帝国主义对南朝鲜的强占，我们的祖国虽然已经解放了十四年，但是，直到今天，却仍然处于不能容忍的状态中：国土被分裂，单一民族的我国人民隔居南北。
    美帝国主义强占南朝鲜以后，到今天为止，一贯阴谋分裂我们的祖国，在南朝鲜实行恶毒的殖民地奴化政策。
    他们粗暴地破坏关于和平解决朝鲜问题的国际公约，用挑起侵略战争来回答朝鲜人民要求和平统一祖国的正当要求。
    战争给朝鲜人民带来了史无前例的深重灾难和痛苦。然而，美帝国主义侵略者并没有屈服奋起保卫祖国的荣誉、自由和独立的朝鲜人民；残酷的朝鲜战争，以朝鲜人民的胜利而宣告停战。
    从那时起，已经过了六个年头。但是，朝鲜的和平继续受到严重威胁，分裂的朝鲜仍然没有统一。
    由于美帝国主义对南朝鲜的强占，朝鲜人民的政治、经济和文化发展一直受到阻碍。
    因此，今天朝鲜的北半部和南半部，走着完全相反的两条道路。
    现在，在人民当家做主的共和国北半部，正热火朝天地进行着和平劳动。
    共和国北半部的人民，通过辛勤的创造性劳动，在短短的时间里，从根本上改变了国家的面貌。本来是落后的半封建殖民地的我国北半部，尽管在战争中遭到严重的破坏，却早已经成为具有巩固的民族自立经济基础的工农业国。
    去年，共和国北半部的工业生产，已经超过解放前1944年水平的四倍以上。因此，剥削、贫困、失业和饥饿，在共和国北半部早已一去不复返了。
    可是，今天的南朝鲜，已经变成一座骇人听闻的活地狱：人民没有权利，到处是饥饿，而法西斯统治的实权则操在美军手里。
    南朝鲜的工业，遭到极其惨重的破坏。为数达六百六十万的失业者和半失业者徬徨街头，这在世界上任何一个国家也是少见的。
    肥沃的土地荒废不堪，慢性饥馑席卷了整个南朝鲜。只是今年年初，就有七十万户农民陷入断粮的绝境。
    孤儿成群结队在街头流浪，乞讨，死亡；挣扎在生死线上的南朝鲜人民，面临着被卖到异国去给靠皮鞭致富的美洲农场主做奴隶的威胁。
    美帝国主义野兽，对不合自己胃口的政党和社会团体以及个人活动，用中世纪的方式进行镇压，并且继续任意屠杀南朝鲜人民。
    南朝鲜人民的这些不幸和痛苦，不能再继续下去。
    我们共和国政府，为了祖国的和平统一，接连提出了实现南北协商和南北经济文化交流等切实可行的建议，并且为了拯救陷入痛苦深渊的南朝鲜人民，不止一次地采取了措施。然而，这些正当的措施，每一次都遭到美帝国主义和李承晚匪帮的顽固阻挠和拒绝，因而没有实现。
    今天，中国人民志愿军撤出北朝鲜已有一年，美军不但没有撤走，反而阴谋长期霸占南朝鲜，用挑起战争的蠢动来回答共和国政府关于和平和和平统一的建议。
    他们把李承晚傀儡军从停战当时的十六个师扩充到三十一个师，并且运入原子武器，建立原子基地，最近更频繁地进行“原子机动演习”，叫嚣“北进”，疯狂地进行战争准备。他们还破坏停战协定，不断在军事分界线进行非法侵犯和枪炮射击。
    侵略者们，他们签字的停战协定墨迹未干，就又梦想玩侵略之火，进一步露骨地阻挠朝鲜问题的和平解决。这不仅是对朝鲜和平，而且也是对远东和世界和平的严重威胁。
    这一切祸根就在于美帝国主义的侵略政策和美军强占南朝鲜。
    如果美帝国主义侵略军不强占南朝鲜，朝鲜人民早就会和平统一自己的祖国，南北朝鲜人民也就早会一起过幸福富裕的生活了。
    朝鲜，是朝鲜人的朝鲜。朝鲜问题必须由朝鲜人民自己和平解决。
    美帝国主义侵略集团的任何手段，也无法使美国侵略军赖在南朝鲜正当化。美帝国主义必须立即把自己的军队撤出南朝鲜。这是所有要求和平国家人民的一致主张。
    朝鲜人民懂得：自己维护和平、争取民族统一、要求美军撤出南朝鲜的正义斗争，决不孤立，而是受到全世界爱好和平人民的一致支持。
    在反对美帝国主义侵略者的共同斗争中取得胜利，并且为维护亚洲和远东和平而斗争的中国人民，坚决、热烈地支持朝鲜人民的这一正义斗争。中国人民的这种支援，更加鼓舞了朝鲜人民坚强的斗争意志。
    目前，在各大洲的每一个角落，谴责和平扰乱者——强占南朝鲜的美帝国主义军队的呼声，更加高涨。
    世界和平理事会常务委员会、世界工联执行委员会、亚非人民团结理事会和国际学生联合会也都分别发表声明，号召全世界支持朝鲜人民的斗争。全世界爱好和平的人民，都在这样支持朝鲜人民的正义斗争。
    面对朝鲜人民的团结斗争，全世界人民强有力的谴责，正当的舆论，美帝国主义侵略集团应该吸取教训，把自己的侵略军队立即撤出南朝鲜。
    朝鲜人民通过自己的正义斗争和全世界爱好和平人民的热烈支持，一定会使美帝国主义侵略军队撤出南朝鲜。
    同是社会主义阵营大家庭一员的朝中两国人民，坚决保卫自己的革命果实，共同关心它的扩大和加强，反对美帝国主义侵略者，一定要把美帝国主义赶出朝鲜的南半部和中国的台湾。我们将永远并肩站在保卫远东和平和社会主义东方前哨的共同战线上。
    以苏联为核心的社会主义阵营的统一和团结万岁！
    朝中两国人民在反对美帝国主义的共同斗争中进一步得到巩固的战斗友谊和团结万岁！世界和平万岁！
