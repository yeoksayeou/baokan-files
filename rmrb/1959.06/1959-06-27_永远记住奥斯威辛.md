    Always Remember Auschwitz
    Auschwitz is now a well-known town in Poland, because in this basin, the Nazi bandits established the largest concentration camp and killing factory in Europe. The Polish-French co-produced documentary "Brutal Fascist Concentration Camps" records the sins of this devil's cave. Here, more than four million people of eighteen nationalities were killed. A gallows here, specifically for killing political prisoners, killed 26,000 people. Prisoners were whipped here, dismembered alive, injected with various germs like white mice, massacred in gas chambers, and thrown into crematoria. The brutal and greedy Hitler bandits, while cruelly exterminating the population, did not forget to rob property, money, and supplies, all the way down to dentures and hair; even the dead were not spared. They extracted fat from corpses to make soap, and used hair to weave "woolen fabric."

    However, the people will not be conquered. People in these death rows never stopped fighting. In order to preserve the truth of history, and to make their descendants and all mankind remember the towering crimes of the fascists for generations to come, the Polish people preserved the original cells and torture chambers and set up museums. People will never forget this human shame, and the hatred for the Nazi bandits will never be erased. They are always on guard against the resurgence of fascism! (Yuan)

    永远记住奥斯威辛
    奥斯威辛，现在已经是举世皆知的波兰小镇，因为在这片盆地上，纳粹匪徒曾经建立了一座欧洲最大的集中营和杀人厂。波兰和法国合摄的纪录片“残暴的法西斯集中营”，纪录下了这个魔窟里的罪恶。在这里，曾经有包括十八个国籍、数达四百万以上的人被杀害。这里的一个专门杀害政治犯的绞架，就害死了二万六千人。囚徒们在这里被鞭打，被活活支解，像白鼠一样被注射各种病菌，被屠杀在毒气室，被投进炼人炉。残暴贪婪的希特勒匪徒，在凶残地消灭人口的同时，并没有忘记抢劫财物、金钱用品、一直到假牙、头发，就是死人也没被放过，他们榨取尸首的脂肪来制作肥皂，用头发织成“呢绒”。
    然而，人民是不会被征服的。在这死囚里的人们没有停止过斗争。波兰人民为了使历史的真相得以保存，使自己的后代和全人类世世代代永远记住法西斯的滔天罪恶，把原来的牢房和刑房保存下来，设置博物馆。人们永远也忘不了这人类的耻辱，消不掉对纳粹匪徒的仇恨。他们时刻在警惕着法西斯的死灰复燃！　（沅）
