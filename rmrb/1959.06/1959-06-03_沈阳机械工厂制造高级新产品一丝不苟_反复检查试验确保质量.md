Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, June 2nd: Shenyang machinery manufacturing is meticulously inspecting, testing, and researching during the trial production of new products to ensure product quality.

This year, Shenyang City's machinery factories have trial-produced over 200 new products, many of which are advanced "major, sophisticated, and cutting-edge" products for equipping major industries across the country, such as heavy rolling mills, large transformers, high-temperature and high-pressure water pumps, and automated machine tools. Many factories, considering the pivotal role these devices will play in the production of user departments, are determined to implement the policy of "a century-long plan, quality first." On the one hand, they have strengthened ideological education for workers, overcoming the "guarantee quantity, not quality" mentality that exists among some workers. On the other hand, based on mass airing of views and debates, they have established and improved inspection, testing, research, and other systems, taking all measures to ensure quality. When Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant discovered cracks and sand inclusions in the "750" rolling mill frame and 400-ton hot shear frame due to poor casting quality, they immediately took reinforcement measures and made spare parts for the hot shear, ensuring quality. Shenyang Low-Voltage Switchgear Factory recently trial-produced a set of 48-meter-long large rolling mill electrical control equipment, which required the installation of a large number of parts manufactured by 44 cooperating units across the country onto 64 control panels and 14 operating consoles. After installation, the factory conducted transmission tests and finished product inspections on each control panel and operating console separately. Due to such meticulous inspection work, the quality of the finished products was excellent.

In order to ensure product performance, factories particularly emphasize on-site operational testing of major products. After the products leave the factory, they send special personnel to the users to conduct quality inspections. Shenyang Water Pump Factory recently began trial production of a large water pump known as the "King of Water Pumps" and a high-temperature and high-pressure water pump for power stations in small batches. During processing in the factory, inspection personnel followed the product components to conduct quality inspections. After the products left the factory, they were followed to Jilin Power Station and other places for repeated testing, which the users found very satisfactory.

    沈阳机械工厂制造高级新产品一丝不苟
    反复检查试验确保质量
    新华社沈阳2日电　沈阳机械制造业在新产品的生产试制中，反复检查试验研究，确保产品质量。
    沈阳市机械工厂今年共试制出二百多种新产品，其中不少是装备各地大工业的“重大精尖”高级产品，如重型轧钢机、大型变压器、高温高压水泵和自动化机床等。许多工厂考虑到这些设备对于使用部门的生产将发生举足轻重的作用，必须贯彻“百年大计、质量第一”的方针，一面对工人们加强了思想教育，克服部分工人中存在的“保量不保质”的想法，一面在群众性鸣放辩论的基础上，建立和健全检查、试验、研究等制度，采取一切措施把住质量大关。当沈阳重型机器厂发现试制的“七五○”轧钢机机架和四百吨热剪机机架由于铸造质量差发生裂纹、包砂现象时，立即采取了加固措施，并为热剪机做了备品，保证了质量。沈阳低压开关厂最近试制一套四十八公尺长的大型轧钢机电气控制设备，需要用国内四十四个协作单位制造的大量零件安装到六十四个控制屏和十四个操纵台上。在安装以后，这个工厂对每个控制屏和操纵台都分别进行了传动试验和成品检查。由于进行了这样细致的检查工作，结果成品质量良好。
    为了确保产品使用性能，各厂特别重视重大产品的实地运转试验。他们在产品出厂以后派遣专人跟到用户去做质量检查。沈阳水泵厂最近开始小批试制一种号称“水泵之王”的大型水泵和一种电站用的高温高压水泵。在厂内加工时检查人员跟随着产品部件进行质量检查；产品出厂后，又跟到吉林电站等地进行反复试验，用户感到很满意。
