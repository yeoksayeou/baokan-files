Raising Fish in the Suburbs Has Many Advantages
Heilongjiang Provincial Commercial Department Aquatic Bureau

    Under the leadership of the local Party and government, the aquatic industry in the eight industrial and mining cities of Heilongjiang Province—Harbin, Qiqihar, Mudanjiang, Jiamusi, Yichun, Jixi, Hegang, and Shuangyashan—has developed along with the development of industrial and agricultural production. The eight cities have a total of 450,000 mu of water surface suitable for fish farming, of which 90,000 mu have been developed and utilized. In 1958, these areas stocked more than 74 million grass carp, silver carp, carp, and crucian carp fry, producing more than 11,800 tons of fish, an increase of more than 2,000 tons compared to 1957. The professional aquatic teams here have grown to more than 8,400 people.

    In 1958, according to the province's aquatic development guidelines proposed by the Provincial Party Committee and in light of the specific conditions of each city, the eight cities strengthened their leadership over the aquatic industry, established specialized aquatic agencies (sections, stations, etc.), and equipped them with full-time aquatic cadres. The Party and government leadership departments of the eight cities attached great importance to this production. The First Secretary of the Qiqihar Municipal Party Committee, the Mayor, the Minister of Finance and Trade, and the Director of the Bureau of Commerce often went to the front lines to guide production. The Municipal People's Committee also conducted a high-yield experimental pond on one and a half mu of water surface, which has now begun feeding. The 1,500-mu Hujia Pao in this urban area has been transformed from a stinky pond into a fish pond. The lake has now built about 300 baiting platforms, feeding a large amount of bait every day. This year, it plans to produce 4 million jin of fish, using large-scale bumper harvests to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the National Day. Qiqihar City has now achieved full utilization of all water bodies.

    Several cities such as Qiqihar generally have professional aquatic people's communes and aquatic professional teams scattered in various people's communes. State-owned enterprises (aquatic farms, farms, factories), government agencies, and schools have all recognized the advantages of fish farming, which requires little investment, yields quick results, and is of great significance, and have participated in this production. These are the basic forces for the development of fish farming production in these cities.

    Although the development of the aquatic industry in these cities has achieved certain results, it is very uneven.

    Through the development of the aquatic industry in the suburbs of various cities in the province in recent years, we have realized in this work that the development of suburban fisheries production, like the development of other undertakings, must resolutely rely on and strive for the leadership and support of the Party. The First Secretaries and Mayors of Qiqihar, Harbin, Jiamusi, Hegang, and other cities often personally take charge of aquatic production and have repeatedly mobilized more than 40,000 person-times of government cadres, factory and mine workers, students, and military officers and soldiers to participate in voluntary labor and rush to support the construction of fish ponds. Due to the strengthened leadership, the aquatic production in these areas has developed relatively quickly.

    We have also realized that the development of fish farming production in the suburbs of industrial and mining cities has many favorable conditions: First, the water quality in the suburbs of cities is generally more fertile, and fish production is high; the urban area has abundant fertilizer sources, a lot of waste, and abundant feed, which lowers the cost of fish farming. Second, the development of suburban fish farming allows for immediate sales upon production, with fewer circulation links, which can guarantee the freshness of fish products, making them cheap and of good quality, and satisfying all three parties: production, supply, and sales. Third, side-by-side farming and sales guarantee year-round supply and holiday needs, flexibly adjusting to market needs. This is more effective and economical than building cold storage facilities. Fourth, the development of suburban fish farming can increase commune income, expand public accumulation, improve the lives of commune members, and promote commune production. Fifth, fish consume microorganisms and insects in the water, reducing water pollution and eliminating pests such as mosquitoes, which is conducive to improving urban environmental sanitation. Sixth, cities have a large labor force, and the professional fish farming teams can be combined with the rush support from organizations such as government agencies, schools, factories, mines, and troops, which both trains cadres and develops fish farming production.

    市郊养鱼好处多
    黑龙江省商业厅水产局
    黑龙江省哈尔滨、齐齐哈尔、牡丹江、佳木斯、伊春、鸡西、鹤岗、双鸭山八个工矿城市，在当地党政的领导下，随着工农业生产的发展，水产事业也获得了发展。八个城市共有养鱼水面四十五万亩，已开发利用的达九万亩。1958年这些地区放养草、鲢、鲤、鲫鱼种七千四百多万尾，产鱼一万一千八百多吨，比1957年增产二千多吨。这里的水产专业队伍已发展到八千四百多人。
    1958年八个市根据省委提出的发展水产方针，结合各市的具体情况，加强了对水产事业的领导，设立水产专门机构（科、站等），配备了水产专职干部。八个市的党、政领导部门都很重视这项生产。齐齐哈尔市的市委第一书记和市长、财贸部长、商业局长等经常深入现场指导生产，市人民委员会还搞了一亩半水面的高产试验塘，现已开始喂养。这个市区内的一千五百亩的胡家泡，已由过去的臭水泡变为养鱼池。这湖目前已搭设投饵台三百来个，每天大量投饵，今年计划产鱼四百万斤，用大面积丰产成绩，向国庆十周年献礼。齐齐哈尔市目前已做到有水皆利用。
    齐齐哈尔等几个市一般都有专业水产的人民公社和分散在各人民公社的水产专业队。国营企业（水产养殖场、农场、工厂）、机关、学校都认识到养鱼是投资小，收效快，意义大的优点，而参加了这项生产。这些都是这几个市发展养鱼生产的基本队伍。
    这几个市水产事业的发展虽有一定的成绩，但是很不平衡。
    通过近年来省内各城市郊区的水产事业的发展，我们在这项工作上体会到：发展城郊的渔业生产和发展其他各项事业一样，必须坚决依靠和争取党的领导和支持。齐齐哈尔、哈尔滨、佳木斯、鹤岗等市的第一书记、市长等党委领导经常亲自抓水产，并多次动员机关干部、厂矿工人、学生、部队官兵四万人次以上参加义务劳动，突击支援修造鱼池。由于领导加强，这些地区的水产生产发展就较快。
    我们还体会到：发展工矿城市郊区的养鱼生产，有许多有利条件：第一、市郊水质一般都较肥，养鱼产量高；市区肥源充足，废弃物多，饵料丰富，养鱼成本低。第二、发展市郊养鱼，随产随销，流转环节少，可以保证鱼品的鲜度，做到价廉物美，使产、供、销三方面都满意。第三、边养边销，保证常年供应和节日需要，灵活调剂市场需要。这样作比修建冷藏库更有效、更节省。第四、发展市郊养鱼可增加公社收入，扩大公共积累，改善社员生活，促进公社发展生产。第五、鱼类取食水中的微生物和昆虫，减低水质污秽，消灭蚊虫等害虫，有利于改善城市的环境卫生。第六、城市劳力多，养鱼的专业队伍可以和机关、学校、厂矿、部队等团体的突击支援相结合，既锻炼了干部，又发展了养鱼生产。
