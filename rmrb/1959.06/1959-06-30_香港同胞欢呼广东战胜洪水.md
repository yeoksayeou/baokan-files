Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, June 29th: This reporter reports: Hong Kong compatriots are cheering the people of Guangdong for overcoming the floods, and are pleased that the victims have been properly resettled and relieved by the government.

Hong Kong compatriots were particularly moved by the deeds of party, government, and military leaders such as Tao Zhu, Chen Yu, Zhu Guang, and Liu Xingyuan personally going to the North River embankment to command, the army, navy, and air force, as well as a large number of cadres from government offices, throwing themselves into the flood-fighting battle, and all the people uniting as one to subdue the floods. He Lin, an elderly man from Sanshui, said: "During the great flood of Yimao (1915), not even the shadow of an official could be seen. Now the People's Government cares so much about the lives and property of the people, which is truly something I have never seen before."

    香港同胞欢呼广东战胜洪水
    据新华社香港29日电　本社记者报道：香港同胞欢呼广东人民战胜洪水，并且对灾民得到政府的妥善安置和救济表示欣慰。
    香港同胞对陶铸、陈郁、朱光、刘兴元等党政军领导人亲上北江大堤指挥、陆海空三军以及大批机关干部投入抗洪战斗、全体人民万众一心制服洪水等事迹特别感动。三水籍老人何林说：“乙卯（1915）年大水时，连半个官儿的影子也见不到，现在人民政府这样关怀人民的生命财产，真是从来没有见过。”
