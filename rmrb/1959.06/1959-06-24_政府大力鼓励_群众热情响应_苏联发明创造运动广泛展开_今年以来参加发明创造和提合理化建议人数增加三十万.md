Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 23rd - In order to rapidly promote technological progress, the Soviet Union has adopted many new measures since the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to encourage the development of mass invention and innovation and rationalization proposal movements. Now, on all production fronts in the Soviet Union, the number of people participating in invention and innovation and making rationalization proposals has increased from 1.7 million at the end of last year to 2 million. In many factories across the country, people involved in invention and innovation and making rationalization proposals account for a quarter of the total number of employees.

Starting from May 1st this year, the Soviet Union implemented new regulations on invention and innovation and rationalization proposals. This regulation greatly promotes the enthusiasm of employees in invention and innovation and making rationalization proposals, as well as the implementation of invention and innovation and rationalization proposals in production. According to this regulation, the Committee on Inventions and Discoveries under the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union must compile the inventions and innovations and major suggestions of employees from all over the Soviet Union into a booklet on a quarterly basis and distribute it to the Councils of Ministers of the various Union Republics, the competent ministries, the National Economic Councils, and the Executive Committees of the Soviets, and instruct them to make corresponding resolutions based on these materials, instructing relevant enterprises to implement them. There are specific provisions for the starting and completion dates of the implementation of each suggestion. In addition, the new regulations clarify the implementation procedures for rationalization proposals and the responsibilities of enterprise leaders. In addition to making many new provisions to encourage inventors and innovators and those making rationalization proposals, it also specifically stipulates that anyone who delays or treats the examination and implementation of inventions and innovations with bureaucracy must bear certain legal responsibilities.

In order to encourage the masses to engage in invention and innovation and make rationalization proposals, the Central Committee of the Soviet Lenin Communist Youth League and some economic social organizations jointly organized the 1959 agricultural rationalization proposal and invention competition among rural youth. The Central Committee of the Estonian Republic Communist Youth League and the Republic National Economic Council decided to hold an excellent rationalization proposal and invention competition in the Republic's machinery manufacturing industry this year. At the Moscow-Ryazan locomotive depot in Moscow, all work shifts participating in the communist labor team competition are required to submit at least one rationalization proposal for production per person. Moscow City and Oblast have also decided to greatly encourage employees to make rationalization proposals this year.

Since the 21st Congress of the CPSU, in promoting invention and innovation and rationalization proposal movements, the Soviet Union, in addition to relying on state organs and enterprise authorities, has also paid great attention to mobilizing social organizations to participate in this work. Not long ago, under the initiative of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions of the Soviet Union, the All-Union Association of Inventors and Rationalizers was established. Now, branches of the association have been organized in various places, and branches have been organized in factories. Another social organization, the Scientific and Technical Association, has recently experienced great development, and its membership has reached 800,000. Now, these social organizations are fully engaged in promoting technological progress and invention and innovation.

Starting this year, all industrial enterprises in the Soviet Union have held economic conferences or technical and economic conferences, attended by advanced producers and rationalization proposers from the factories. At these conferences, the power of the masses is used to promote rationalization proposals and focus on solving key problems in production. For example, at the economic conference of the Orsk-Khalilovo Metallurgical Combine, a series of measures were formulated to tap the factory's potential. These measures can enable the factory to save 40 million rubles this year.

Since the beginning of this year, more and more ordinary workers have been cooperating with engineering and technical personnel and scientific research personnel to jointly carry out invention and innovation and make rationalization proposals. Many factories have organized comprehensive work teams with workers and technicians to jointly solve production problems. For example, the Chelyabinsk Tractor Factory has established 200 such work teams, with 1,500 people participating. These work teams have become a driving force for carrying out rationalization proposals and invention and innovation in the factory.

As a result of taking many measures and mobilizing the masses more widely and deeply, the number of inventions and innovations and rationalization proposals made by employees in various parts of the Soviet Union has increased significantly this year. For example, employees in the Belorussian Economic Region submitted a total of 25,000 inventions and rationalization proposals last year, while this year, in the first quarter alone, they submitted 11,000.

    政府大力鼓励  群众热情响应
    苏联发明创造运动广泛展开
    今年以来参加发明创造和提合理化建议人数增加三十万
    新华社莫斯科23日电　为了迅速促进技术进步，苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会以后，苏联又采取了许多新措施，鼓励展开群众性的发明创造和合理化建议运动。现在，苏联各生产战线上，参加发明创造和提合理化建议的人数已经从去年年底的一百七十万人增加到二百万人。在全国的许多工厂中，有发明创造和提合理化建议的人已占全体职工人数的四分之一。
    从今年5月1日起，苏联实行了新的发明创造和合理化建议条例，这个条例对鼓励职工在发明创造和提合理化建议方面的积极性及在生产中实施发明创造和合理化建议有很大促进作用。按照这个条例，苏联部长会议发明和发现事务委员会必须按季度将苏联各地职工的发明创造和重大建议编制成册，分发到各加盟共和国部长会议、各主管部、各国民经济委员会和苏维埃执行委员会，并责成它们根据这些资料作出相应的决议，指示有关企业执行。每一建议的开始实现和完成期限都有具体规定。此外，新条例对于合理化建议的实施程序、企业领导人的责任都作了明确规定。它除了在鼓励发明创造和合理化建议者方面作了许多新的规定外，还特别规定，凡是拖延或以官僚主义态度对待发明创造的审查和实施的人必须负一定的法律责任。
    为了鼓励群众进行发明创造和提合理化建议，苏联列宁共产主义青年团中央委员会和一些经济性的社会团体共同在农村青年中举办1959年农业合理化建议和发明创造比赛。爱沙尼亚共和国共青团中央和共和国国民经济委员会决定今年在共和国机器制造业中举行优秀合理化建议和发明创造比赛。在莫斯科的莫斯科—梁赞机车调度站，凡是参加共产主义劳动队竞赛的工作班都规定每人至少要提出一条生产上的合理化建议。莫斯科市和州也决定要在今年大事鼓励职工提合理化建议。
    苏共二十一次代表大会以后，苏联在推动发明创造与合理化建议运动方面除了依靠国家机关和企业主管部门外，还十分注意发动社会团体参加这项工作。不久以前，在苏联工会中央理事会倡议下，成立了全苏发明家与合理化建议者协会。现在，各地都组织了协会的分会，在工厂中都组织了支会。另一社会团体——科学技术协会最近有了很大的发展，它的会员人数已达八十万人。现在，这些社会团体都全力投入了促进技术进步和发明创造的工作。
    从今年起，苏联各工业企业都举行了经济会议或技术经济会议，由工厂的先进生产者和合理化建议者参加。在这种会议上，运用群众力量推动合理化建议，并集中解决生产上的关键问题。例如，在奥尔斯克—哈里洛夫斯克钢铁联合工厂的经济会议上制订出了一系列发掘工厂潜力的措施，这些措施可以使工厂在今年内节约四千万卢布。
    今年以来，有越来越多的普通工人跟工程技术人员和科学研究人员合作，共同进行发明创造和提出合理化建议。许多工厂都组织了有工人和技术人员参加的综合工作队，共同解决生产上的问题。例如车里雅宾斯克拖拉机工厂已成立了二百个这样的工作队，有一千五百人参加。这些工作队成了工厂里开展合理化建议与发明创造的一支推动力量。
    由于采取了许多措施和更加广泛深入地发动了群众，今年苏联各地职工的发明创造和合理化建议数目有了显著增加。例如，白俄罗斯经济区的职工去年共提出了二万五千件发明和合理化建议，而今年单是第一季度就提出了一万一千件。
