    One Can Do the Work of Ten
    Xiao Yan
    In the past, in Wugang County, Hunan Province, an average of 10,000 laborers (8% of the county's labor force) were tied to small stone mills or using heavy stone mortars and pestles to pound rice every day. Now, an average of only 1,000 laborers are needed each day. This is the effect of the reform of grain and oil processing tools. It truly is one can do the work of ten, a contribution of immeasurable merit!
    In the vast rural areas of our country, apart from cooking, grain and oil processing probably occupies the most labor in household chores. For generations, countless laborers have been shackled by backward tools such as heavy stone mills and stone mortars. After the communization, the establishment of public canteens liberated a large amount of labor used for household chores. The backward grain and oil processing tools that had been used in a decentralized manner for so many years became even more unsuited to the development of the objective situation. At the same time, communization also created favorable conditions for the comprehensive reform of grain and oil processing tools. Grain and oil processing tools can achieve indigenous mechanization and semi-mechanization today, and gradually achieve full mechanization in the future. In this regard, the tremendous superiority of the people's communes will also be demonstrated.
    The example of Wugang County basically achieving indigenous mechanization and semi-mechanization provides much inspiration. The fact that they were able to accomplish this great feat in just over eight months shows that the Party and government leaders of Wugang County have a high degree of mass perspective, and the cadres and masses throughout the county have an abundant spirit of conquering difficulties. They resolutely followed the principle of "taking indigenous methods as the main focus, combining indigenous and foreign methods, adapting to local conditions, and using local materials" to advance victoriously. This county is located in a mountainous area with a population of only 380,000, and it lacks power equipment, raw materials, and technical strength, facing numerous difficulties. However, they did not bow their heads in the face of difficulties; instead, they vigorously mobilized the masses and launched a technical innovation movement. They actively adopted substitutes, using solid wood to replace steel, and finally manufactured machines such as water turbines, rice milling machines, and animal-powered universal toothed disks. The problem of the lack of technical strength was solved by inviting people to teach, sending people to visit and learn, and opening short-term training classes for on-the-spot training. This is such a valuable spirit!

    以一当十
    肖彦
    过去，在湖南武冈县，平均每天要有一万个劳动力（占全县劳动力的8％）围着小石磨打转，或者用笨重的石臼石杵舂米。现在，平均每天只有一千个劳动力就够了。这是粮油加工工具改革的效果。真是以一当十，功德无量！
    在我国广大农村的家务劳动中，除了做饭而外，恐怕要算粮油加工占用的劳力最多了。世世代代，多少劳动力，都被笨重的石磨、石臼等落后工具束缚着。公社化以后，成立了公共食堂，解放了大量用于家务的劳动力。沿用了多少年代分散使用的落后的粮油加工工具，更显得不适应于客观形势的发展了；同时，公社化也给粮油加工工具的全面改革创造了有利的条件。粮油加工工具今天就能做到土机械化和半机械化，将来更可以逐步达到全部机械化。在这个方面，也将显示人民公社的巨大优越性。
    武冈县基本上实现土机械化和半机械化的事例，给人不少启发。他们所以能在八个多月内，办成了这件大好事，说明了武冈县党政领导人员有高度的群众观点，全县干部和群众有充沛的征服困难的精神。他们坚决遵循“以土为主、土洋结合、因地制宜、就地取材”的方针，胜利前进。这个县地处山区，只有三十八万人口，动力设备、原材料、技术力量等等都很缺乏，困难重重。但是，他们并没有在困难面前低头；而是大力发动群众，大搞技术革新运动。他们积极采用代用品，用坚实的木料代替钢铁，终于制成了水轮机、碾米机、畜力万能齿盘等机械。技术力量缺乏的问题，采取请人传授、派人参观学习和开短期训练班就地培训等办法解决了。这是多么可贵的精神！
