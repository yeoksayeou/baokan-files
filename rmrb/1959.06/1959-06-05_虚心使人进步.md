Humility Leads to Progress

Comrade Mao Zedong often taught us: "Humility leads to progress, arrogance leads to backwardness." This is an irrefutable truth.

Humility, of course, is not as some of our comrades imagine, that one has no opinion of one's own when encountering matters, and regardless of whether the opinions of others are right or wrong, one agrees and acts accordingly; or that one has correct opinions, but once someone objects, one does not persist, but abandons one's own correct opinions and accepts the incorrect opinions of others. This attitude, from the surface, seems to be humble, but in reality, it is not humility at all, but rather self-abasement, blind conformity, lacking the spirit of pursuing truth and adhering to truth.

So-called humility, first of all, requires an honest and scientific attitude, respecting materialism, respecting dialectics, proceeding from reality, and seeking truth from facts. Constantly understanding history and the current situation, conducting investigations and research, effectively grasping objective conditions, making one's judgments completely in line with reality, and with the changes in objective conditions, constantly revising one's outdated views. Throughout this series of processes, one's mind should not be rigid or inflexible, and one should not replace the objective with the subjective. This should be said to be a sign of true humility.

Secondly, so-called humility means having a broad mind, being good at listening to opinions from all sides, and choosing the good ones to follow. One's knowledge, energy, and time are limited. A clever person, a person who is good at doing work, especially leadership work, lies in gathering the wisdom of the masses as one's own wisdom, respecting not only the opinions of superiors, but also the opinions of those around and the masses; listening not only to the opinions of the majority, but also to the opinions of the minority, even a single person; listening not only to the opinions of the advanced, but also to the opinions of the backward. Doing so, as the ancients said, "listening to both sides makes one clear," makes it easier to correctly analyze, judge, and handle problems. Here, it should be particularly emphasized that we must humbly listen to the opinions of the masses. The people are the creators of history, the masters of society. Everything we revolutionaries do is for the masses, for the interests of the masses. Without listening to the opinions of the masses, nothing can be done well.

Thirdly, so-called humility means never being arrogant when victorious, when great achievements have been made in work. When victorious, the easiest problem to arise is being blinded by victory, failing to see or being unwilling to see the shortcomings, difficulties, and new problems in the work, becoming paralyzed with complacency, and resting on one's laurels, resulting in achievements becoming burdens and victories turning into failures. In this regard, there are countless historical lessons.

Fourthly, so-called humility means having the spirit of constantly learning and striving for progress. Chairman Mao said: "The enemy of learning is one's own complacency. To seriously learn something, one must start with not being complacent." Humble people always feel their own inadequacy, learning from books, learning from practice, learning from everyone, and the more they learn, the more they feel their inadequacy, and the more inadequate they are, the more they must learn.

### 虚心使人进步

    虚心使人进步
    毛泽东同志经常教导我们：“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”。这是一个颠扑不破的真理。
    谦逊，自然不是像我们某些同志所想像的那样，遇事没有自己的见解，不管别人的意见对与不对，一律同意，一律照办；或者自己有正确的意见，但是一旦有人反对，就不坚持，而放弃自己的正确意见，去接受别人的不正确意见。这种态度，从表面上来看，似乎是谦逊的，实际上并不是什么谦逊，而是妄自菲薄，盲从附会，没有追求真理和坚持真理的精神。
    所谓虚心，首先就是要有老老实实的科学态度，尊重唯物论，尊重辩证法，从实际出发，实事求是。经常了解历史和现状，进行调查研究，切实掌握客观情况，使自己的判断完全合乎实际，而且随着客观情况的变化，不断地修正自己那些已经过时的看法，在这一系列的过程中，始终头脑不板滞，不僵化，不以主观代替客观，这应该说是一种真正虚心的标志。
    其次，所谓虚心，就是要虚怀若谷，善于听取各方面的意见，择其善者而从之。一个人的知识、精力、时间都是有限的，一个聪明的人，一个善于做工作特别是做领导工作的人，就在于集众人之智慧为自己之智慧，既尊重上级的意见，也尊重左右和群众的意见；既听取多数人的意见，也听取少数人甚至一个人的意见；既听取先进者的意见，也听取落后者的意见。这样做，正如古人所说的“兼听则明”，比较容易正确地分析、判断和处理问题。在这里，应该特别强调的，是要虚心听取群众的意见。人民群众是历史的创造者，是社会的主人，我们革命者所作的一切都是为了群众，为了群众的利益，不听取群众的意见，任何一件事情都是办不好的。
    第三，所谓虚心，就是在胜利的时候，在工作取得很大成绩的时候，决不骄傲。在胜利的时候，最容易产生的问题，就是被胜利冲昏了头脑，看不到也不愿意看到工作中的缺点、困难和新问题，麻痹自满，高枕无忧，结果使成绩变为包袱，使胜利转为失败。在这方面，历史的教训是不胜枚举的。
    第四，所谓虚心，就是要有不断学习、力求上进的精神。毛主席说：“学习的敌人是自己的满足 ，要认真学习一点东西，必须从不自满开始”。虚心的人总是感到自己不足，向书本学习，向实际学习，向一切人学习，而且愈是学习，愈感到自己不足，而愈不足就愈要学习。
