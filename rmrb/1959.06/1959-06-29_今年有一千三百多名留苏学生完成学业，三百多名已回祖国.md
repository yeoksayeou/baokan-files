Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 26th – With the care of the Soviet Party and government, and after several years of hard study, more than 1,300 Chinese students studying in the Soviet Union have completed their studies this year. As of now, more than 300 have returned to China, and the rest will return to China successively in the near future.

During their studies in the Soviet Union, Chinese students received care and help from all aspects, including the leaders, teachers, and classmates of Soviet schools, and their academic performance continued to improve. Chinese and Soviet students at the Moscow Geological Institute specifically established mutual aid groups, with Soviet students helping Chinese students learn Russian, make up for missed notes, etc. The graduating students generally achieved good results in their graduation exams and thesis designs.

During their studies in the Soviet Union, Chinese students not only studied actively but also participated in various activities organized by the schools. Together with Soviet students, they participated in voluntary labor such as building the Dynamo Stadium and the subway, and they generally participated in various self-service movements organized by the schools. Every year, many students helped collective farms and state farms reclaim wasteland and harvest crops. They received profound communist labor education during their labor, and their political awareness was raised. They also established deep friendships with many Soviet people during these activities.

The graduating students this year have all expressed that after returning to China, in addition to dedicating the scientific and technological knowledge they have learned in the Soviet Union to the construction of the motherland, they will also be active promoters of Sino-Soviet friendship.

The Soviet Ministry of Higher Education, the Soviet Academy of Sciences, and schools and research institutions in various regions attach great importance to the return of Chinese students after completing their studies. Many school leaders presided over farewell parties, issued graduation certificates to Chinese students, and exchanged souvenirs with the students.

    今年有一千三百多名留苏学生完成学业，三百多名已回祖国
    新华社莫斯科26日电　在苏联党和政府的关怀下，经过几年的刻苦学习，今年已有一千三百多名我国留苏学生完成学业，到目前为止，已有三百多名回国，其余的人也将于最近陆续回国。
    我国留学生在苏联学习期间，得到了苏联学校的领导、教师、同学等各方面的关怀和帮助，学习成绩不断提高。莫斯科地质学院的中苏同学，专门成立了互助组，苏联同学帮助中国同学学俄文、补记笔记等。这次毕业的同学毕业考试和论文设计成绩一般都良好。
    我国留苏学生在苏联学习期间，除了积极学习外，还参加了学校组织的各种活动。他们和苏联同学一道，参加了修建狄纳莫运动场、地下铁道等义务劳动，并普遍参加了学校举办的各种自我服务运动，每年都有很多同学帮助集体农庄和国营农场开垦荒地和收割。他们在劳动中受到了深刻的共产主义的劳动教育，提高了政治觉悟。在这些活动中，他们还同许多苏联人建立了深厚的友谊。
    今年毕业的留学生都表示回国后除了把在苏联学到的科学技术知识献给祖国的建设外，还要做中苏友谊的积极的宣传者。
    苏联高等教育部、苏联科学院、各地学校和研究机关都非常重视我国留学生学成归国，许多学校的负责人都主持欢送会，给我国留学生颁发毕业证书，并同学生互相赠送纪念品。
