Xinhua News Agency, Brighton, September 8th: According to TASS, the annual meeting of the British Trades Union Congress, held in Brighton on September 3rd, closed on the 7th. At the closing session, the annual meeting passed a resolution demanding that the government make efforts to convene a summit conference of various countries to strive for an agreement on disarmament. The resolution believes that the heads of government of various countries should support the proposal to immediately cease testing atomic and hydrogen weapons and prohibit the continued production of these weapons as a first step in disarmament. The conference also passed a resolution demanding a reduction in the burden of military spending to alleviate the British economic emergency.

At the conference, a proposal was also put forward calling for the cancellation of repressive measures in Cyprus and the withdrawal of all British troops from the island to peacefully resolve the Cyprus issue. Under pressure from the General Council, it was finally rejected.

The Amalgamated Engineering Union put forward a proposal criticizing the Labour Party leadership for failing to safeguard the interests of the working class on many very important international and domestic issues. The General Council used a procedural trick to postpone the discussion of this issue, so the conference continued without a vote on the matter.

Many unions supported the proposal to implement a 40-hour work week. Although the General Council opposed it, the proposal was passed.

    英职工大会年会闭幕会议通过决议
    要求政府争取召开各国首脑会议达成裁军协议
    并要求减轻军事开支缓和英国经济紧急状态
    据新华社8日讯　据塔斯社布莱顿讯：9月3日在布莱顿举行的英国职工大会年会已经在7日闭幕。在闭幕会议上，年会通过了一项决议，要求政府努力设法召开各国政府首脑会议以争取就裁军问题达成协议。决议认为，各国政府首脑应该支持立即停止试验原子武器和氢武器并且禁止继续生产这些武器的建议，作为裁军的第一个步骤。大会还通过一项决议，要求减轻军事开支的重担，以缓和英国经济的紧急状态。
    在大会上还提出了一项提案，要求取消对塞浦路斯的镇压措施，并且从这个岛上撤退所有英国军队以和平解决塞浦路斯问题。在最高委员会的压力下，终于被否决。
    机车制造工会提出一项提案，批评工党领导机构在许多非常重要的国际问题和国内问题上没有能够维护工人阶级的利益。最高委员会在程序上耍了一个花样来推延这个问题的讨论，于是大会继续开会，并没有就这个问题进行表决。
    许多工会支持实行每周四十小时工作制的提案。最高委员会虽然反对，结果这个提案还是获得通过。
