    A Suggestion
    Beifengwo, outside Fuxingmen in Beijing, is an area with a concentration of government offices and employee dormitories. The roads here are very bad, and there are no sewage facilities. During the rainy season, the roads are muddy and difficult to walk on. Rainwater has nowhere to drain and flows into the courtyards of residents. Stagnant sewage often accumulates in the low-lying areas alongside the roads. In winter, the sewage freezes, and pedestrians often slip and fall. There have even been cases of pregnant women being injured in falls. We hope that the relevant construction departments in Beijing will repair the roads here and build sewage systems.

    一项建议
    北京复兴门外北峰窝是一个机关和职工宿舍集中的地区。这里的道路很坏，没有下水道设备，雨季，道路泥泞，行走困难，雨水无处排泄，流入居民院内；道旁低洼处常有积存的污水，冬季污水结冰，时有行人滑倒，并且曾经发生过摔伤孕妇的事情。希望北京市有关建筑部门检修这里的道路和在这里修建下水道。
