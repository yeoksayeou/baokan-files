Xinhua News Agency, New York, September 22nd. TASS reported from New York on the 22nd: According to a United Press reporter in London, the British Admiralty announced that on September 20th, a violent explosion occurred on the British destroyer "Decoy" while it was docked off the coast of Malta.

The destroyer "Decoy," displacing 2,610 tons, is one of Britain's newest warships. Its firepower and armor are comparable to those of a light cruiser. Due to Egypt's nationalization of the Suez Canal Company, this destroyer, along with other warships, was dispatched to the Mediterranean region as a reinforcement force for Britain and France.

    英舰一艘在马耳他爆炸
    新华社22日讯　塔斯社纽约22日讯：据合众社驻伦敦记者报道，英国海军部消息，9月20日，停泊在马耳他岛海岸的英国驱击舰“迪科伊号”发生了剧烈的爆炸。
    这艘排水量达两千六百一十吨的“迪科伊号”驱击舰是英国最新的军舰之一。它的火力和装甲同轻巡洋舰一样。由于埃及把苏伊士运河公司收归国有，这艘驱击舰同其他军舰一起被派遣到地中海地区，作为英法的增援武装力量。
