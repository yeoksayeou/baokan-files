Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, September 9th. Hong Kong business community figures continue to issue statements denouncing the so-called "entry-exit balance" measures implemented by the Hong Kong British authorities.

    Tang Bingda, Vice Treasurer of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, Vice Chairman of the North and South Trading Association, and Director and Manager of Nam Tai Hong, said that he personally disagrees with the Hong Kong government's reimposition of entry restrictions, and that even a housewife or an old woman would disagree. It directly affects family reunions for residents and impacts the prosperity of the market. He said that traffic between Hong Kong and Guangzhou has been unobstructed for the past century. When trains used to run directly, people could go to Guangzhou after work, negotiate business, and then return to Hong Kong by boat, still having ample time to go to work in the morning. Now, the Hong Kong British authorities have suddenly announced the re-implementation of entry restrictions, which has greatly disappointed the residents of Hong Kong and Kowloon. For the benefit of Hong Kong and the mainland, the restrictions should be lifted promptly.

    Tsang Shu-ping, Chairman of the Hong Kong Metalware Merchants Association, said that in the past few months, when entry restrictions were relaxed, many Hong Kong residents took the opportunity to visit, see relatives, and meet friends, and brought some daily necessities to the mainland, which was beneficial to clearing the inventory in Hong Kong. Now, with the reimposition of restrictions, Hong Kong residents are wary of returning to the mainland due to the cumbersome procedures, and these businesses are affected.

    Kwan Siu-tat, a Director of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, said that historically, residents of the mainland and Hong Kong have had close ties, with family members and relatives living in both places, traveling back and forth freely. This sudden re-restriction on population entry and exit in Hong Kong has caused inconvenience to residents. He hopes that the Hong Kong British authorities can restore the freedom of movement for residents between Guangdong and Hong Kong as soon as possible.

    Chan Yat-fung, Manager of Chan Yat-fung Company, said: Hong Kong residents have close social and economic ties with the mainland. For example, some people do business or work in Hong Kong, but their families live in the mainland; some have their whole family in Hong Kong, while their children study in the mainland. These relatives in the mainland inevitably need to visit them in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong government's current implementation of entry restrictions hinders these family reunions. Implementing entry restrictions is useless. Looking at the past few months, thousands of people have left Hong Kong every day, and these people inevitably buy some daily necessities. If we calculate HK$10 per person, this is a huge amount. The benefits of close exchanges are evident from this. Obstructing exchanges, let alone other harms, causes losses to the market.

### 香港工商界人士  继续指责英国当局的无理措施

    香港工商界人士
    继续指责英国当局的无理措施
    新华社广州9日电　香港工商界人士继续发表谈话，指责香港英国当局实施所谓“出入平衡”的措施。
    中华总商会副司库、南北行公所副理事长、南泰行董事兼经理汤秉达说，香港政府重施入港限制，不但是我本人不能同意，就是一个家庭妇女、一个老太太也会不同意。它直接影响到居民的家人聚会：影响到商场繁荣。他说，香港和广州的交通过去百年来一向无阻，以前火车直通的时候，有人在办公之后，趁火车去广州接洽了生意，然后乘船回港，还有充分时间在早晨赶去办公。如今香港英国当局突然宣布重新实行出入限制，使港九居民大失所望。为了香港和内地的利益，应该迅速撤消限制。
    香港五金商业总会理事长曾树屏说，前几个月放宽入港限制，有许多香港居民趁参观、探亲、会友之便，都带点日用品到内地去，这对于疏通本港的存货都有好处，现在重施限制，香港居民要返内地也因手续麻烦而形成戒惧，这些生意就受到影响了。
    中华总商会会董关少达说，内地和香港之间，有史以来居民关系密切，家属戚友居于两地，互相往返，自由无间，此次香港突再限人口出入，使居民蒙受不便，希望香港英国当局能早日恢复省港居民来往自由。
    陈一峰公司经理陈一峰说：香港的居民和内地有着密切的社会关系和经济关系，比如有的人在香港作生意或办事，他的家人却住在内地；有的人全家在香港，而他的儿女则在内地读书。这些在内地的亲人，免不了要去香港探望他们。港府现在实施入境限制，就使得这些家庭的亲人聚会受到阻碍。实行入境限制是无益的，可以看看这几个月间，每天都有好几千人离港，这些人难免要买些日用品，假如以每人买港币拾元计算，这项数目就很巨大。密切往来的益处由此可见。往来受阻碍，别的害处且不说，商场就蒙受损失。
