    My Views on Some Issues in Genetics
    Tan Jiazhen, Head of the Biology Department, Fudan University
    Genetics is a young science. It has only been a little over fifty years since the two laws of inheritance – segregation and independent assortment – derived by Mendel from pea hybridization experiments were rediscovered and confirmed in 1900. During this period, this science has grown in constant development. The reason why genetics, which everyone considers young, occupies an important position in biological science today is partly because it involves a wide range of fields, not only closely related to various departments of biology such as morphology, taxonomy, physiology, biochemistry, individual development, and systemic development, but also inextricably linked to agricultural practice and healthcare; on the other hand, because the research methods it adopts are diverse, such as in addition to using basic hybridization methods, it also uses cytological methods, developmental physiology methods, biochemical methods, biophysical methods, and biomathematical methods, etc., so that the results obtained are more in line with the standards of modern so-called exact science. It is no accident that genetics has become one of the basic biological sciences.
    The main purpose of genetics is to reveal the laws of inheritance and variation between parents and offspring. We should first clarify what the material basis of heredity is. Regarding this question, the Morgan school in genetics, from primitive organisms such as bacteriophages to the highest biological types, on the basis of repeatedly confirming Mendel's law of segregation, combined with cytological research, has determined that not only the chromosomes (in the nucleus for those with nuclei) in the cell body and the hypothetical genes on the chromosomes are the main substances that determine heredity, but also the decisive chemical components that make up these substances, according to the research results of the transformation genetics of pneumococcus and the transduction genetics of bacteriophages, know that it is deoxyribonucleic acid in the nucleus. The diversity of deoxyribonucleic acid revealed by recent biochemical data, and the possibility of its selective pairing, provides strong evidence for the meiosis mechanism of chromosomes and genes during physiological cell maturation. In addition to chromosomes and genes having their own genetic ability, facts tell us that small organelles in the cytoplasm, such as centrosomes, mitochondria, plastids, and particles (called cytoplasmic genes) with gene-like behavior found in the cytoplasm of certain organisms, also have their own genetic ability. However, these substances either do not exist universally, or because there are not many of them, or because the reproductive mechanism is not as regular as that of chromosomes, or because they are produced by mutations of nuclear genes, it is now known that their role in the genetic mechanism cannot be compared with the importance of chromosomes and genes. We should now further study the role of the cell nucleus in cytoplasmic inheritance and cytoplasmic differentiation, and we should study the role of the cytoplasm on the cell nucleus. In fact, some research work using microbial materials, such as the analysis of killer particles in Paramecium and respiratory enzymes in yeast, has yielded very important results on the problem of the interaction between the cell nucleus and the cytoplasm.
    There is a certain distance between the genetic material (like chromosomes and genes that are already known more clearly) from the fertilized egg of two parents and the traits that are more closely related to them. One should never mechanically equate genes and traits, and even less should one understand genetic phenomena with one gene determining one trait. Genes are recognized through their mutations and the characteristics they manifest in inheritance. The influence caused by a gene is multifaceted; facts show that almost every gene is related to the strength of viability and fertility. The particularity of individual gene action depends not only on the actual situation of all genetic material, but also on a certain cytoplasmic basis and certain environmental conditions. Therefore, the performance of a gene should be considered as determining the way the organism reacts in the individual development process that contains a series of intricate physiological and biochemical chain reactions. It is strictly limited by temporal and spatial factors, thereby differentiating a variety of genetic characteristics. How genes specifically play a leading role in the process of individual development is an important topic in the modern development of genetics. There is a lot of material, including animals, plants, and microorganisms, proving that individual genes have the function of regulating or controlling chemical processes. For example, the genetic characteristics of various human urias, the chain reaction of anthocyanins in plants, and the biological synthesis of red bread mold, are sufficient to illustrate that genes affect chemical reactions through enzyme action. Whether genes themselves produce enzymes or promote the formation of enzymes by surrounding substances requires further analysis and research. For more complex genetic characteristics, such as the shape of organisms, the location of organs, and the fixed situation of special substances in various developmental stages, it seems that the theory of simple gene control of chemical reactions cannot be used to explain. This is an important and relatively difficult research area that still needs the cooperation of genetics, embryology, physiology, and biochemistry to solve.
    As the main material basis of heredity, the study of the mechanism of variation of chromosomes and genes has great significance both theoretically and practically. Under natural conditions, genes and chromosomes can mutate. Under artificial treatment, using strong factors such as various radiations, high temperatures, and special chemicals, the mutation frequency can be greatly increased. Facts prove that these artificially produced mutation types are consistent with the mutations obtained under natural conditions, indicating that the factors that cause mutations under natural conditions and the factors of artificial treatment only have quantitative differences but no qualitative differences. The presence of trace amounts of cosmic rays and ultraviolet rays in the atmosphere, as well as the phenomenon of sudden temperature changes, are probably related to mutations. Whether occurring naturally or artificially, there is no doubt that most of the mutation traits obtained are unfavorable to the organism itself or to human requirements, and this phenomenon is easily imagined. But it should be known that not all mutations are unfavorable. According to the results of a Swedish botanist's research on barley, approximately one in every eight hundred has economic value to humans, proving that artificial induction of mutation is an effective method for obtaining excellent varieties. Facts have also proven that this method has played a great role in increasing the yield of microbial antibiotics. The use of colchicine to induce the formation of polyploids in overcoming the infertility of distant hybridization is another type of effective method for producing excellent species, which has played a certain role in agricultural practice. Mutations of genes and chromosomes are also the main raw materials of biological evolution. In the past, my personal research on the similarities and differences of genetic material within and between species of fruit flies has also obtained proof. Using artificial methods to change living conditions to carry out selection experiments proves that the factors that select variations are different from the factors that cause variations. My personal analysis of the close relationship between the differences in the types of heritable color spot variations of Asian ladybugs in different populations and geographical distribution and seasonal changes can also provide reference information for relevant views in this regard. Therefore, I believe that the theory that the adaptive production caused by the external environment relies on the two opposing processes of mutation and selection is not without basis.
    In the past ten years, the Michurin school of genetic theory developed in the Soviet Union is different from the internationally recognized so-called gene theory. It mainly believes that the genetic mechanism does not need to be explained by chromosomes and genes, but that every bit of living matter in the organism can play a genetic role. Therefore, changes in living conditions can promote corresponding variations in heredity through the assimilation process. If these varied substances can pass through germ cells, they can be inherited, and thus the conclusions of directed cultivation and the inevitable inheritance of acquired traits are derived. I believe that the theory of directed cultivation proposed by Michurin marks the lofty desire of mankind to control and transform biological types, and may raise the development direction of genetics, and even the entire biology, to a higher stage. Although this is the case, so far, the genetic mechanism on which this theory is based lacks scientific basis, and the cited experimental results on the asexual hybridization of solanaceous plants and the mutual transformation of spring and winter wheat as the main argument for the inheritance of acquired traits do not seem to be sufficiently convincing. However, judging from the recent preliminary research results of the Morgan school on cytoplasmic inheritance and directed variation of microorganisms, the Morgan school is not without a common foundation with the basic spirit of Michurin's theory.
    I believe that the current domestic genetic workers, whether belonging to the Michurin school, the Morgan school, or the middle school, under the correct call of the Chinese Communist Party to promote "let a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend", through this historically significant genetics symposium held in Qingdao, which is full of emotional harmony and heated debate, we will certainly implement the Party's policy, learn from each other with an open mind, learn from each other's strengths and make up for weaknesses, and we will certainly be able to eliminate all unnecessary and unscientific prejudices, and work together to strive to catch up with the international level of this young and basic biological science – genetics – within twelve years.

    我对遗传学中一些问题的看法
    复旦大学生物系主任　谈家桢
    遗传学是一门年轻的科学。自从孟德尔在碗豆杂交试验中得出的分离和自由组合两个遗传规律在1900年被重新发现和证实以来，到现在不过是五十多年的历史。在这个时期内，这门科学在不断发展中成长起来。今天大家认为年轻的遗传学在生物科学中占重要位置的原因，一方面由于它所牵涉的范围很广，不仅同生物学各部门如形态分类、生理、生化、个体发育和系统发育等有密切的关系，而且又同农业实践和保健事业有不可分割的关系；另一方面由于它所采用的研究方法是多种多样的，如除采用基本杂交方法以外，还运用细胞学方法、发育生理学方法、生物化学方法、生物物理方法和生物数学方法等，使所获得的成果比较合于近代所谓准确科学的标准。遗传学成为基本的生物科学之一决不是偶然的。
    遗传学的主要目的在于揭发亲体同子代之间的遗传和变异的规律。我们首先应该弄清楚什么是遗传的物质基础。关于这个问题，遗传学里面的摩尔根学派，从原始生命体如噬菌体到最高生物类型，在反复证实孟德尔分离规律的基础上，结合细胞学上的研究，已经确定不仅细胞体内（有核的在核内）的染色体和染色体上的假定的基因，是决定遗传性的主要物质，而且组成这些物质的决定性化学成分，根据肺炎球菌的转化遗传和噬菌体转变遗传的研究成果，知道是核胞里的去氧核糖核酸。最近生物化学资料所揭示的去氧核糖核酸的多样性，和它的选择配对的可能性，给染色体和基因在生理细胞成熟时的减数分裂机制提供了有力证明。除了染色体和基因有自生的遗传能力以外，事实告诉我们，细胞质内的小器官如中心体、粒线体、色素体以及在某些生物体细胞质里所发现的类似基因行为的颗粒体（叫做细胞质基因），也有自生的遗传能力。但是，这些物质或者由于不是普遍存在，或者由于数目不多，或者由于繁殖机制不像染色体那么有规律，或者由于它们是核内基因突变所产生，现在知道它们在遗传机制上的作用，其重要性不能同染色体和基因相比拟。现在应该进一步研究细胞核在细胞质遗传和细胞质分化中的作用，应该研究细胞质对于细胞核的作用。事实上，有些利用微生物材料的研究工作，如草履虫的放毒颗粒和酵母的呼吸酶的分析，已经在细胞核和细胞质的相互作用问题上得出很重要的成果。
    来自两个亲体的受精卵的遗传物质（像已经知道比较清楚的染色体和基因）和它们比较密切联系的性状之间，是有一定距离的。决不能机械地在基因和性状之间划一等号，更不应该以一个基因决定一个性状来理解遗传现象。基因是通过它的突变和随着在遗传上所表现的特性来认识的。一个基因所引起的影响是多方面的；事实说明几乎每个基因对生活力和生育力的强弱都有关系。个别基因作用的特殊性，不仅取决于全部遗传物质的实际情况，而且取决于一定的细胞质基础和一定的环境条件。因此，基因的性能，应该认为是在包含一连串错综复杂的生理生化的连锁反应的个体发育过程中，决定机体反应的方式。它受着时间上和空间因素的严格限制，从而分化出来多种多样的遗传特性。关于基因在个体发育过程中，怎样具体地起主导作用，是近代遗传学发展上一个重要的课题。已经有不少材料，包括动物、植物、微生物在内，证明个别基因有调节或控制化学过程的作用，例如人类各种尿病的遗传特性，植物花青素的连锁反应，红色面包霉的生物综合，足以说明基因是通过酶作用来影响化学反应的。基因是否本身产生酶，还是促使周围的物质形成酶，还须进一步分析和研究。对比较复杂的遗传特性，如生物的体形，器官的位置，各个发育时期特殊物质的固定情况，似乎不能用单纯基因控制化学反应理论来解说，这是重要的而比较困难的研究方面，还有待于遗传学、胚胎学、生理学和生物化学的通力合作来解决。
    作为遗传的主要物质基础，染色体和基因发生变异机制的研究，在理论上和实践上都有很重大的意义。在自然情况下，基因和染色体能发生突变。在人工处理下，利用强烈因素，如各种放射线、高温、特殊的化学品，能使突变频度大量增加。事实证明，这些人工产生的突变类型和在自然情形下所获得的突变是一致的，可知在自然情况下引起突变的因素和人工处理的因素，仅有量的差异而没有质的区别。大气中存在着微量宇宙线和紫外光线以及温度骤变的现象，就大概和突变有关。不论在自然发生和人工产生的情况下，毫无疑问，所获得的突变性状大部分对生物本身或是对人类的要求是不利的，这种现象是很容易想像的。但是应该知道不是一切突变都是不利的。根据瑞典一位植物学家对大麦研究的结果，大约平均八百个中间有一个对人类有经济价值的突变，证明人工诱导突变是一种获得优良品种的有效方法。事实也证明，在提高微生物抗生素产量上，这个方法已经起了很大的作用。利用秋水仙素导致多倍体的形成，在克服远缘杂交不孕性，是另一类产生优良种类的有效方法，已经在农业实践上起了一定的作用。基因和染色体的突变，也是生物进化的主要原料。我个人过去在研究果蝇种内和种间遗传物质的异同问题上，也得到了证明。利用人工方法改变生活条件来进行选择试验，证明选择变异的因素是不同于引起变异的因素。我个人在分析亚洲瓢虫遗传性色斑变异类型在不同群体中的差异同地理分布和季节变化的密切关系，也可以提供作为有关这方面的看法的参考资料。因此，我认为外界环境引起适应性的产生是有赖于突变和选择二个对立过程的理论，不是没有根据的。
    近十年来，在苏联发展起来的米丘林学派的遗传理论，是不同于国际间所公认的所谓基因学说的。它主要认为遗传机制不必用染色体和基因来解说，而生物体内一点一滴的活质都能起遗传作用。因而生活条件的改变，能通过同化过程促使遗传性的相应变异。这些变异了的物质，如果能通过生殖细胞，就能遗传下去，于是得出定向培育和获得性必然遗传的结论。我认为米丘林提出的定向培育理论，标志着人类控制和改造生物类型的崇高愿望，可能把遗传学，甚至整个生物学的发展方向提高到更高的阶段。虽然这样，到目前为止，这个理论所根据的遗传机制还缺乏科学基础，所引证的有关茄科植物无性杂交和春冬小麦相互转变的试验成果，作为获得性遗传的主要论证，似乎没有足够的说服力。但是，从摩尔根学派最近开展的有关细胞质遗传和微生物定向变异的初步研究成果来看，摩尔根学派不是同米丘林学说的基本精神没有一点共同的基础的。
    我相信当前国内遗传学工作者，不论属于米丘林学派、摩尔根学派或中间派，在中国共产党提倡“百家争鸣”的正确号召下，通过这次在青岛举行的感情融洽而争论热烈的、富有历史意义的遗传学座谈会以后，我们一定会贯彻党的方针，相互虚心学习，取长补短，一定能消除一切不必要的和非科学性的成见，同为争取在十二年内，把这门年轻而基本的生物科学——遗传学赶上国际水平而努力。
