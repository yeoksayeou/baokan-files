Putting Zhang's hat on Li's head is a bad thing. Those who aspire to be engineers of the human soul should avoid it like the plague, but some people admire and love it.

Although examples are not numerous, two can be readily picked up.

	Firstly, there is a certain long poem, originally mobilized by a dozen young comrades to collect material. Needless to say, this was a truly painstaking task, involving listening to others sing, asking people to translate, recording, and organizing. After carrying out this work separately, they had to gather together and organize it again. The work, at this stage, was like traveling ninety miles of a hundred-mile journey. Of course, the administrative leader had to take a look and offer opinions; and the administrative leader was also duty-bound to take a look and offer some opinions. Who knew that after the opinions were offered, when the long poem was published, our leader's name was listed first! And the comrades who truly spent their hard work and suffering were not even worth mentioning!

	Secondly, there is a certain play depicting workers, which was created by several comrades discussing and proceeding together. After the script was written, it naturally had to be sent to the leadership to take a look. The leaders also naturally had to offer opinions and talk about its strengths and weaknesses. But when the play was published, this enthusiastic leader became the leader of the collective creation!

These two examples are enough to illustrate the problem. In our lives, there are people who like to put Zhang's hat on Li's head.

Of course, it is a bit shameful to say it bluntly!

If one has to put one's name on it, or even insist on putting one's name first, just for offering a few suggestions or changing a few words, then wouldn't the editor have to put his name on every article or every book? But there are no such editors, yet such leaders are found in literary organizations or theater troupes!

We often see articles in newspapers and periodicals denouncing people who plagiarize other people's articles as immoral, but this kind of putting Zhang's hat on Li's head, forcibly seizing and grabbing, has been tolerated for a long time.

The comrades who are forcibly suppressed at the bottom are inconvenient to publish anything. First, these leaders have indeed offered opinions, and of course, they have also put in their efforts; second, these leaders should, of course, lead everywhere; third, will the leader say that I have become proud, will they, in a fit of anger, even prohibit the publication of the work; and other such completely unexpected things.

Since the name is forcibly ranked first, the royalties are bound to be distributed more. It is really a satisfactory deal, gaining both fame and fortune!

Of course, it is also a shameful thing to say it bluntly!

    张冠李戴
    亦鸟
    张冠李戴是不好的事情，想作人类灵魂工程师的人本来应避而远之，可惜倒有人敬而爱之。
    例子虽不甚多，也可随手拣来两个。
    其一，有某长诗，原来是动员了十几位青年同志下去收集的，不用说这是一番真正辛苦的工作，要听别人唱，要请人翻译，要记录，还要整理。分头进行这样的工作后，还要集中，又得一番整理。工作到了这个阶段，已是百里之遥，行了九十里了。当然得请行政领导人过过目，提提意见；而作行政领导的也是责无旁贷，应该过过目，提一些意见的。那知意见提了之后，长诗发表时，我们的领导人就名列第一了！而真正花了苦辛的同志们，连名字也不屑一提了！
    其二，有某部描写工人的剧本，创作时是由几位同志商量进行的，剧本写成之后，当然得送领导上看看，领导人也自然要提提意见，说说长短，而剧本发表时，这位热心的领导人又成为集体创作的领队了！
    这两个例子是能够说明问题的。我们的生活中就有这样喜爱张冠李戴的人。
    当然，说穿了是有些羞人的！
    如果提了几条意见，或改动了一些词句，就要挂上一个名字，甚至把名字硬要放在第一，那么，作编辑的岂不是在每一篇文章或每一本书上都要挂上自己的名字？但是，没有这样的编辑，却在文艺机关或剧团中发现这样的领导人！
    我们常常在报刊上看见痛斥抄袭别人文章的人如何不道德的文字，而这种张冠李戴，豪夺硬抢的事倒长期容忍了。
    硬被压在底下的同志是不便发表什么的，第一，这些领导人确实提过意见，当然也就付出了心血；第二，这些领导人当然应处处领导；第三，会不会被领导人说我已骄傲起来了，会不会在一怒之下，连作品也不准发表；以及诸如此类完全意想不到的事。
    既然名字硬排在首位，稿费也势必多分。真是如意的买卖，名利双收！
    当然，说穿了也是见不得人的事啊！
