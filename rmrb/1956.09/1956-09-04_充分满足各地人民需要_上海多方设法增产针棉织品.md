Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, September 2nd: Shanghai's relevant industrial departments are exploring production potential from various aspects to increase the output and variety of knitted and cotton goods to meet the needs of people in various regions.

The total output value of knitted and cotton goods factories in the city in the second half of this year will increase by about 15% compared with the same period last year. Some knitted underwear factories have decided to extend the production time of cotton interlock shirts and pants to the end of December, in order to increase production by another 50,000 dozens. The Shanghai Children's Socks Factory and Towel Factory, known for their variety and beauty, also have forty to fifty idle machines, which are also being prepared to be put into operation one after another. Some plain socks factories with surplus equipment are seeking assistance from machinery factories to convert plain sock knitting machines into children's sock knitting machines. Following the famous Sanyou, Pacific, Shanzhong, Datong and other towel and bed sheet factories implementing three-shift production, there are currently four or five towel and bed sheet factories that are also stepping up the training of new workers, preparing to implement three-shift production in the fourth quarter.

The city's major knitted and cotton goods industrial companies have established research organizations to improve products, and have paid special attention to researching, improving, and increasing some high-end products suitable for the needs of urban consumers. The handkerchief factory has added high-end handkerchiefs of 60-count and 80-count fine and soft texture, and has newly designed four to five hundred varieties and patterns. The transparent short nylon women's stockings successfully trial-produced by the knitted production cooperative, and the six-strand thick woolen yarn and two-strand and three-strand fine woolen yarn that the woolen mill has resumed production of, are all popular among urban and rural consumers.

Knitted underwear factories, which account for about one-third of the country's knitted underwear products, jointly established a variety research group with the Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Station of China Knitted and Cotton Goods Company a month ago. They gathered more than thirty underwear tailoring experts, and by the end of August, they had designed twenty-six new underwear styles.

    上海多方设法增产针棉织品
    新华社上海2日电　上海有关工业部门正在从多方面设法挖掘生产潜力，增加针棉织品的产量和花色品种，来满足各地人民的需要。
    全市针棉织品工厂今年下半年的生产总值，将比去年同期增加15％左右。一部分针织内衣厂，决定把生产棉毛衫裤的时间延长到12月底，以便再增加五万打。以品种多样、美观著称的上海童袜厂和毛巾厂，还有四、五十台闲置的机器，也准备陆续开动起来。部分设备有余的平口袜厂在找机械工厂协助，准备把平口袜织机改装成童袜织机。继著名的三友、太平洋、善钟、大统等毛巾被单厂进行三班生产之后，目前还有四、五个毛巾被单厂也在加紧训练新工人，准备在第四季度内进行三班生产。
    全市的几个主要针棉织品工业公司，都设立了改进产品的研究组织，并且特别注意了研究改进和增加一些适合城市消费者需要的高级产品。手帕工厂新增加了质地细薄柔软的六十支和八十支高级手帕，新设计的品种和花样有四、五百种。针织生产合作社试制成功的透明短口尼龙女丝袜，毛纺厂恢复生产的六股粗绒线和二股、三股细绒线，都受到城市和乡村消费者的欢迎。
    占到全国针织内衣产品大约三分之一的针织内衣厂，一个月前跟中国针棉织品公司上海采购供应站联合成立了品种研究组，集中了三十多个内衣剪裁专家，到8月底为止，他们已经设计了二十六种新的内衣式样。
