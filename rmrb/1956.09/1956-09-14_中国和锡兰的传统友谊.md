    The Traditional Friendship between China and Ceylon
    Chen Yan
    Ceylon and China are geographically far apart. The land route requires crossing mountains, and the sea route requires traversing two oceans. However, history tells us that mountains cannot stop the friendly exchanges between the people of China and Ceylon, and the sea cannot sever the close ties between our people. According to Chinese historical records, the traditional friendship between the people of China and Ceylon can be traced back to 1,900 years ago.
    According to the geographical records in the “Book of the Former Han,” in the years 1-6 AD, Wang Mang sent envoys to Huangzhi (in present-day India). "South of Huangzhi is Yichengbu, from which the Han translators returned." Some Chinese and foreign scholars in the past believed that the above-mentioned countries of "Huangzhi" and "Yichengbu" were both located in India, but according to recent research by Chinese scholars, they are today's Ceylon. It can be seen that as early as the beginning of the first century AD, China and Ceylon began to have exchanges.
    The first Chinese document to record Ceylon in detail is “A Record of Buddhist Countries” written by Faxian in the Eastern Jin Dynasty. "A Record of Buddhist Countries" refers to Ceylon as the Lion Country. The book mentions that in Ceylon he saw white silk fans from Jin offered by merchants next to Buddhist statues, and that the former king of Ceylon had sent envoys to China. Faxian himself lived in Ceylon for two years and later returned home on a merchant's ship. All this shows that before Faxian, Chinese merchants and navigators had already been to Ceylon, and Ceylon had already sent envoys to visit China. Faxian went to Ceylon to seek Buddhist scriptures and brought back Sanskrit classics such as the "Mahāsāṃghika-Vinaya" version, the "Dirghāgama," the "Samyuktāgama" and a "Miscellaneous Pitaka." These Buddhist scriptures were not previously available in China. After the "Mahāsāṃghika-Vinaya" version was brought back, it was translated into thirty-four volumes (thirty volumes extant) by eminent monks such as Zhisheng and Huiyan at Longguang Temple, and called the "Five-Part Vinaya"; the "Dirghāgama" was translated by the eminent monk Fonian from Liangzhou into forty volumes, called the "Four-Part Vinaya"; the "Samyuktāgama" of fifty volumes was translated at Waguan Temple by eminent monks such as Gunabhadra. The introduction of these Buddhist scriptures into China enriched the content of Chinese Buddhist culture and had a great impact on Buddhism in China.
    After Faxian took the sea route back to China, from the Southern and Northern Dynasties to the Tang Dynasty, eminent monks from China and India traveled back and forth, abandoning the land route and taking the sea route one after another. According to the “Biographies of Eminent Monks Who Traveled to the Western Regions in the Great Tang Dynasty” written by Yijing, from 424 AD, famous eminent monks from Ceylon who came to China to promote Buddhism included: Gunavarman, Gunabhadra, Nandi Sangha, Sanghavarman, Arijaka, Vajra (i.e. Amoghavajra) and Prajña. They were all learned scholars. For example, Gunabhadra was not only well-versed in the Tripitaka, proficient in medicine, astronomy, calligraphy and mathematics, but also a translator. He translated many classics, and some of the Buddhist scriptures that Faxian brought back from Ceylon were translated by him. Another example is Nandi Sangha, who collected more than 500 fascicles (more than 1,500 volumes) of Mahayana and Hinayana Sutras and Vinayas. They made outstanding contributions to the spread of Buddhist culture in China. On the other hand, many Chinese eminent monks went to India and Ceylon to worship the Buddha's tooth and seek Buddhist scriptures. Among them, famous eminent monks included: Mingyuan and Yilang from Yizhou, Kuichong and Huiyan from Jiaozhou, Wuxing from Jingzhou, Dachengdeng from Aizhou, Sengzhe from Lizhou, and Huiri from Donglai. When they arrived in Ceylon, they were all solemnly received by the king. Some of them later went to India, and some, such as Huiyan, Wuxing and Sengzhe's disciple Xuanyou (Korean), lived in Ceylon and never returned. The above documents are valuable records in the history of Buddhist relations between the two countries. This also shows that Ceylon was a medium for the mutual dissemination of Buddhist culture between China and India, and it made indelible contributions to promoting cultural exchange and friendly relations between China and India.
    With the mutual spread of Buddhist culture, the friendly exchanges between China and Ceylon from the Jin Dynasty to the Tang Dynasty became more frequent. According to the “History of Song,” “Book of Liang” and “History of the Southern Dynasties,” Ceylon began to send envoys with gifts such as jade statues to China for friendly visits at the beginning of the Yixi period of the Jin Dynasty (405-418 AD). After that, in 428 AD and 435 AD (5th to 12th year of Yuanjia), King Salimuhānāma of Ceylon sent envoys twice to present tooth platform statues and other gifts to China. In 527 AD (the first year of Datong in the Liang Dynasty), the later King Kasyapa Kalāhara sent an envoy to present a memorial, wishing to "jointly promote the Three Jewels" with China, and presented many valuable gifts to China.
    During the Tang Dynasty, the mutual visits of envoys from the two countries continued uninterrupted. According to historical books such as "New Book of Tang" and "Cefu Yuangui", Ceylon sent friendly envoys to China three times in 670 AD (the 3rd year of Zongzhang), 746 AD and 750 AD (the 5th and 9th years of Tianbao). Among them, in the 5th year of Tianbao, King Silamimega of Ceylon sent Brahman monks Guanding Sanzang, Arijaka and Vajra to China. The gifts included gold-plated items, precious necklaces, a Sanskrit "Mahā Prajñāpāramitā Sutra" written on palm leaves, fine white cloth, ivory, true (precious) pearls and other treasures.
    During the Song, Yuan and Ming dynasties, there were many records about Ceylon in Chinese ancient books. Especially during the Ming Dynasty when Zheng He was sent to the West, the friendly exchanges between China and Ceylon became more frequent. According to the "History of Liao", "History of Ming", "Yingya Shenglan", "Xingcha Shenglan", "Tianxia Junguo Libingshu" and other records, Ceylon sent envoys to establish friendly relations in 989 AD (the 7th year of Tonghe of Emperor Shengzong of Liao). In 1409 AD (the 7th year of Yongle), Zheng He visited Ceylon on his voyage to the West, bringing gold and silver sacrificial vessels, embroidered gold, and treasure banners to donate to Buddhist temples. Zheng He erected a monument in Ceylon to commemorate the friendship between the people of China and Ceylon. This stone tablet was first discovered in Galle Town in southern Ceylon in 1912. The inscription on the tablet is written in Persian, Tamil and Chinese. This is a precious souvenir in the history of friendly relations between China and Ceylon. When Zheng He returned to China from Ceylon (1411 AD), he escorted King Alekesvara of Ceylon and his wife to Beijing. In 1430 AD (the 5th year of Xuande), Zheng He once again visited Ceylon. In 1433 AD (the 8th year of Xuande), King Parakramabahu VI of Ceylon sent envoys to visit China. After that, Ceylon sent envoys to China twice in 1445 AD and 1459 AD. Each time the envoys came, they presented valuable gifts to China. The gifts included: pearls, corals, gems, crystals, gold rings, Sahara, Western cloth, frankincense, wood incense, tree incense, sandalwood, myrrh, sulfur, rattan, aloe vera, ebony, pepper, bowl stones, tamed elephants and other treasures.
    Ceylon had a brilliant culture in ancient times. Chinese people have highly praised the religious architecture and art of Ceylon, and there have been very rich and extremely detailed and vivid descriptions in various ancient books. For example, Faxian praised it in his "A Record of Buddhist Countries": "A large pagoda rises on the north side of the royal city, forty feet high, decorated with gold and silver and composed of many treasures. Next to the pagoda is a Sangharama called Abhayagiri, with 5,000 monks, and a Buddha hall is built, carved with gold and silver, all with many treasures, and there is a blue jade statue in the middle, more than two feet high, with seven treasures all over the body, its radiant and majestic appearance is beyond description." Another example is Xuanzang's description of the Buddha Tooth Pagoda in Ceylon during his travels in the five Indias: "...Uta (now Orissa, India) faces the sea, and there is the city of Cheli Daluo (now South Andhra), which is the road where merchants entering the sea and travelers from afar stop. It is more than 20,000 li south to the country of Sengjialuo (now Ceylon). Every night when it is quiet and cloudless, one can see the treasure pearl on the Buddha Tooth Stupa from afar, its light shining brightly, like a star candle in the sky." The "Book of Liang" also mentioned that the jade statue sent by Ceylon at the beginning of the Yixi period of the Jin Dynasty (405-418 AD) took ten years to transport to China. The book praised the jade statue as "the jade color is clean and moist, and the shape is very special, almost not man-made." From the Jin Dynasty to the Song Dynasty, it was kept in Waguan Temple. This work of art created by the working people of Ceylon and the five Buddha statues hand-made by the famous Chinese artists Dai Andao and Gu Changkang, as well as the Vimalakirti paintings, shone together in Waguan Temple, and were known as the "Three Wonders" by the world. On the other hand, Chinese architectural art is also preserved in Ceylon. For example, the Portuguese Barbossa said in the sixteenth century that when he sailed around the island of Ceylon, he saw seven Chinese pagodas in Negapatam, which were built by ancient Chinese navigators. Some scholars believe that this may be the "earth pagoda article" in the Chinese ancient book "Daoyi Zhilüe", which records eight Dans. The "Earth Pagoda Article" records: "...living in the plains of Badong. Surrounded by wood and stone, there is an earthen brick pagoda several feet high. The Chinese characters are written that it was completed in August of the 3rd year of Xianchun (1267). It is said that the Chinese people traveled there that year and wrote on stone to engrave it." According to some scholars, Badong may also be in Ceylon, or in the estuary of the Kaveri River in southern India, which is only separated from Ceylon by a body of water.
    Since ancient times, the friendly exchanges and mutual trade between the people of China and Ceylon have been very frequent, so the number of people from the two countries who have stayed in each other's land has also been increasing. From the Jin and Tang dynasties to the Ming Dynasty, countless Chinese monks and merchants stayed in Ceylon. Envoys, monks and merchants from Ceylon also had their descendants staying in Quanzhou, China. For example, "Complete Book of the Four Libraries," volume 55 of "National Dynasty Literary Garden," The Biography of Shi Gongxian says: "Shi Gongxian, styled Ertao, named Shanxiao, was a native of Jinjiang. He was a descendant of King Balaena of Ceylon Mountain...." Balaena may be Parakramabahu VI, who sent envoys to China in 1433 AD. This shows how deep and close the traditional friendship between the people of the two countries is.
    The trade between China and Ceylon began as early as before Faxian went to Ceylon. Later, from the Jin and Tang dynasties to the Song, Yuan and Ming dynasties, there are many records in Chinese and foreign documents. For example, "Yingya Shenglan" wrote that the people of the country were very fond of Chinese musk, ramie silk, colored silk, celadon, plates and bowls, copper coins, and camphor, and exchanged gems and pearls. "The Travels of Ibn Battuta" wrote: Chinese merchants all went to the ports of Karikato, Kulam (now Colombo, the capital of Ceylon), and Heli to trade. At that time, the maritime transportation between China and India was entirely in the hands of the Chinese. Chinese ships were divided into three classes. The largest was called "Zhenke", which could carry a thousand people. Flowers and plants could be planted on the ship to carry people and goods. The management method was the same as modern shipping. Chinese merchants all pre-purchased round-trip tickets. The prosperous trade between China and Ceylon can be seen from the above two documents.
    It is in this way that the people of China and Ceylon have, since ancient times, enriched our already splendid cultures through various forms of cultural exchange and trade, and further developed the traditional friendship between the people of the two countries. It was only in modern times that the friendly relations that had already developed were artificially hindered because both China and Ceylon were subjected to colonialist aggression and oppression. Because of this, the people of the two countries have deepened their mutual sympathy and care in the struggle for national independence.
    Since China was liberated and Ceylon embarked on the road to independence, the traditional friendship and trade relations between the people of the two countries have been restored and developed on a new basis. This time, the Ceylon government delegation headed by K. Corea came to China to negotiate the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries. This marks a new stage in the friendly relations between China and Ceylon. We wish the friendly relations between China and Ceylon will continue to develop.

    中国和锡兰的传统友谊
    陈炎
    锡兰和中国在地理上距离很远，从陆道要跨越重重高山，循海路要横渡两个大洋，但历史告诉我们高山阻挡不了中锡两国人民的友好往来，大海也隔断不了我们人民间的亲密联系。根据我国史籍记载，中锡两国人民的传统友谊可以上溯到一千九百年以前。
    据“前汉书”地理志记载，公元1至6年，王莽曾遣使至黄支国（今印度境内），“黄支之南有已程不国，汉之译使自此返矣”。上面所说的“黄支”和“已程不”两国，据过去有些中外学者考证都在印度境内，但据最近我国学者考证，就是今天的锡兰。可见早在公元一世纪初，中锡两国就开始有了往来。
    我国详细记录锡兰的文献，首推东晋时法显所写的“法显传”。“法显传”称锡兰为师子国，书中谈到他在锡兰曾看到商人供在佛像边的晋地白绢扇和锡兰前王曾遣使中国等事迹。法显本人曾在锡兰住了两年，后来是乘商人的大船归国的。这些都说明了在法显以前，中国的商人和航海家已经到过锡兰，而锡兰也已经有使节访问过中国。法显去锡兰目的是求佛取经，归国时从锡兰带回“弥沙塞律”藏本，“长阿含”，“杂阿含”和一部“杂藏”等梵文经典。这些佛经都是我国以前所没有的。“弥沙塞律”藏本带回后，由智胜、慧严等高僧在龙光寺译成三十四卷（现存三十卷），称为“五分律”；“长阿含”由凉州高僧佛念译出共四十卷，称为“四分律”；“杂阿含”五十卷在瓦官寺由求那跋陀罗等高僧译出。这些佛经的传入我国，丰富了我国佛教文化的内容，对我国的佛教起了很大的影响。
    自法显取道海路回国后，从南北朝一直到唐代，中、印两国高僧的相互往还，弃陆道而取海路者不绝于途。据义净所著“大唐西域传法高僧传”记载，公元424年起，从锡兰来我国弘法的著名高僧有：求那跋摩、求那跋陀罗、那提三藏、僧迦跋罗、阿日伽、跋折罗（即不空）和般剌若等人。他们都是饱学之士。如求那跋陀罗，不但博通三藏，精于医学、天文、书算、而且是个翻译家，他翻了很多经典，法显从锡兰取回的佛经，有一部分就是他翻译的。又如那提三藏曾搜集了大小乘经律五百余夹（合一千五百余部）。他们对我国佛教文化的传播有卓越的贡献。另一方面我国高僧到印度，锡兰顶礼佛牙、求法取经的也很多，其中著名的高僧有：益州的明远和义朗，交州的窥冲和慧琰，荆州的无行，爱州的大乘灯，澧州的僧哲和东莱的慧日等。他们到锡兰时，都受到国王的隆重礼待，有些人后来转往印度，有些人如慧琰、无行和僧哲弟子玄游（朝鲜人）等都在锡兰居住，永不回返。以上文献是两国佛教关系史上的珍贵记录。这也说明了锡兰是中、印两国互相传播佛教文化的媒介，它在促进中、印两国文化交流和友好关系上有过不可磨灭的功绩。
    随着佛教文化的相互传播，中锡两国
  自晋朝至唐代，友好使节的往来也就日益频繁。据“宋史”、“梁书”和“南史”等记载，锡兰于晋义熙初（405—418年）开始遣使携玉像等礼物来我国作友好访问。此后，公元428年和435年（元嘉5年到12年），锡兰国王刹利摩诃南曾先后两次遣使带牙台像等礼物来我国聘问。公元527年（梁大通元年）后王伽叶伽罗诃梨遣使奉表，愿与我国“共弘三宝”，并赠送我国许多珍贵礼品。
    唐代，两国使节的相互聘问仍未中断。据“新唐书”、“册府元龟”等史籍记载，公元670年（总章3年）、746年和750年（ㄌ毂?5年和9年），锡兰三次派友好使节来我国聘问，其中天宝5年这一次，锡兰国王尸罗迷迦，遣婆罗门僧灌顶三藏、阿日伽和跋折罗来我国。赠送礼物中有钿金、宝璎珞、贝叶写的梵文“大般若经”一部、细白?、象牙、真（珍）珠等珍品。
    宋、元、明三代，中国古籍有关锡兰的记载，史不绝书，特别在明朝郑和使西洋时，中、锡两国的友好往来就更加频繁。据“辽史”、“明史”、“瀛涯胜览”、“星槎胜览”、“天下郡国利病书”等记载，公元989年（辽圣宗统和7年）锡兰遣使前来通好。公元1409年（永乐7年），郑和使西洋曾至锡兰，携带金银供器、采籹织金、宝幡布施于佛寺。郑和曾在锡兰立碑纪念中锡两国人民的友谊。这块石碑于1912年始在锡兰南部加里镇发现，碑上刻着波斯文、泰米尔文和汉文，这是中锡两国友好关系史上珍贵的纪念品。郑和从锡兰回国时（1411年）曾偕同锡兰国王亚烈苦难儿和他的妻子等一道来京。公元1430年（宣德5年），郑和再度聘问锡兰。公元1433年（宣德8年），锡兰国王不剌葛麻巴忽剌批遣使聘问我国。此后，公元1445年和1459年锡兰又两次遣使中国。每次来使都赠送我国珍贵礼物。礼物中有：珍珠、珊瑚、宝石、水晶、金戒指、撒哈剌、西洋布、乳香、木香、树香、檀香、没药、硫黄、藤竭、芦荟、乌木、胡椒、碗石、驯象等珍品。
    锡兰在古代就有着灿烂的文化。我国人民对锡兰的宗教建筑和艺术评价很高，在各种古籍中曾经有着非常丰富而极其细致生动的描述。如法显在他的“法显传”中就这样赞叹道：“王城北迹上起大塔，高四十丈，金银庄校众宝合成。塔边复起一僧伽蓝名无畏山，有五千僧，起一佛殿，金银刻镂，悉以众宝，中有一青玉像，高二丈许，通身七宝，炎光威相，严显非言所载。”又如玄奘在游历五印度时，对锡兰的佛牙宝塔也作如下的描述：“……乌荼国（今印度奥里萨）临大海，有折利怛罗城（今南得拉市），即入海商人及远方旅客往来停止之路。南去僧伽罗国（即今锡兰）二万余里。每夜静无云之时，遥望见彼佛牙窣堵波上宝珠，光明莹然，状似空中星烛。”“梁书”中还提到晋朝义熙初年（405—418年）锡兰送来的玉像，费时十载才运到中国，书中盛赞这座玉像为“玉色洁润，形制殊特，殆非人工”。从晋到宋，它一直保存在瓦官寺中。这一锡兰劳动人民所创造的艺术品和我国著名艺术家戴安道、顾长康手制的佛像五躯，以及维摩画图在瓦官寺内相互辉映，世人并称谓“三绝”。另一方面，在锡兰也保存着中国人的建筑艺术，如十六世纪葡人巴尔比说，他在绕行锡兰岛时，见奈格巴塘有中国七塔，为古代中国航海家所建造。有些学者认为这可能就是中国古籍“岛夷志略”中的“土塔条”中记载的八丹。“土塔条”记载：“……居八丹之平原。木石围绕，有土砖甃塔高数丈。汉字书云咸淳3年（1267年）8月毕工。传闻中国之人，其年旅彼，为书于石以刻之。”八丹据某些学者考证也可能就在锡兰，或在与锡兰仅有一水相隔的南印度加惟利河口。
    自古以来，中锡两国人民之间友好往来和相互通商就很频繁，因此两国人民留居在双方的土地上也日益增多。自晋、唐以迄明代，中国的僧侣、商人留居锡兰的不计其数。锡兰来我国的使节、僧侣和商人，也有他们后裔留在我国的泉州。例如“扒?∪?莞?尽本?55“国朝文苑”世拱显传云：“世拱显字尔韬，号山小，晋江人。本锡兰山君长巴来那公之后……。”巴来那可能就是公元1433年锡兰遣使来我国的不剌葛麻巴忽剌批。由此可见，两国人民的传统友谊是怎样的深厚和密切。
    中锡两国的贸易往来，早在法显到锡兰前就已开始，以后自晋、唐到宋、元、明，中外文献对此都有不少记载。如“瀛涯胜览”写道，国人甚喜中国麝香、紵丝、色绢、青磁、盘碗、铜钱、樟脑，并将宝石、珍珠交换。又“拔都他游记”写道：中国商人都到喀里克脱、俱蓝（今锡兰首都科伦坡）、黑里等港贸易。当时中印间海上交通全操在中国人手中，中国船舶分三等，大者曰“镇克”，可载千人，船上可植花草，装载人货，经理办法与现代航业相同。中国商人皆预购来回票。中锡两国的贸易盛况，只举以上这二段文献就可窥其一斑。
    中锡两国人民就是这样从古代起就通过各种形式的文化交流和贸易往来，使我们两国原已十分灿烂的文化更加丰富，并使两国人民的传统友谊更加发展。只是到了近代，由于中锡两国都受殖民主义的侵略和压迫，才使这种已经发展起来的友好关系，受到了人为的阻碍。正因为如此，两国人民在争取民族独立的斗争中，更加深了互相之间的同情和关怀。
    自从中国获得解放，锡兰也走上独立的道路以后，两国人民的传统友谊和贸易关系，又在新的基础上得到恢复和发展。这次以克·科里亚为首的锡兰政府代表团来我国谈判建立两国间的外交关系问题。这标志着中锡两国友好关系的新阶段。我们祝中锡友好关系不断发展。
