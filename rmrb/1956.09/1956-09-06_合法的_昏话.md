“Legitimate” Nonsense
    Wu Gaolun
    In our articles, speeches, and work reports, there are often some nonsense phrases that come out casually or readily, which, in Lenin's words, are in a "drunken state" (the "nonsense" here is not particularly insulting, but simply refers to speaking without thinking). You say this kind of nonsense, and I say it too. No one dares to change it. It seems that no one has ever doubted its correctness and legitimacy. But once it is pointed out, it can be seen that this kind of talk is indeed a bit "confused."
    Please allow me to use a few examples from the People's Daily after its redesign to discuss this.
    On July 1st, in the "In the Capital" column on page 4 of the People's Daily, there was a comprehensive report saying: "Old Beijing was a consumer city, with only a few factories and some handicrafts exclusively for the enjoyment of the exploiting classes." Everyone is familiar with this statement and thinks it is as correct as two plus two equals four. But the latter part of this sentence belongs to the category of "nonsense." Because even the handicraft products of old Beijing were by no means exclusively for the enjoyment of the exploiting classes. They produced daily necessities such as tables, chairs, benches, pots, bowls, and spoons for the vast majority of the people, just like handicrafts in all urban and rural areas of the country. Several relatively expensive handicrafts in Beijing, such as cloisonné, ivory carvings, and carpets, although not affordable for ordinary people, these few items only accounted for a small part of the industries and employees in all handicrafts in Beijing. Moreover, not all of these products were for the enjoyment of the exploiters. These "leftist" and "revolutionary" phrases have almost become catchphrases for some people, but they don't think about how much this violates the facts.
    Another example is a subtitle in a news report on the closing of the Poznan Fair on page 5 of the People's Daily on July 3rd. The title said:
  “China and Poland Reached Huge Transactions with Various Countries.” But the content stated that the Chinese trade delegation signed trade contracts with representatives from various countries totaling more than 3.5 million US dollars. This amount included both imports and exports, and the counterparts were more than 20 countries. No matter how you look at it, this can only be said to be a small transaction. How can it be called a "huge transaction"? It seems that the author did not care about the actual amount when marking the word "huge." Anyway, they had to say "huge." If the transaction was only 350,000 US dollars, some comrades might still mark it as "huge," right?
    Another example, the headline on the front page of the People's Daily on July 27th, strictly speaking, I think it also belongs to this category to some extent. The news reported that a "relatively improved rice transplanter was successfully trial-produced." The subtitle on the theme was "Another Important Development in Mechanization of Rice Cultivation." There are various exaggerations here. First, China's mechanization of rice cultivation is not even worth mentioning. Looking at this title, it seems that it has already been mechanized and is now reaching a new stage of "another important development." Secondly, this "another important development in mechanization" is pulled by a large water buffalo, and there is also a photo illustrating it, which cannot help but make people feel that the title is a bit "humorous." Third, this rice transplanter still has a seedling damage rate of 6%-9% and a missing transplanting rate of 6%-11.3%. This missing transplanting rate is no small matter. In some places in the south where one person averages less than one mu or even only a few fen of paddy field, missing this amount is still a big problem. I am not saying that we should not value this major invention and creation, but that we should not exaggerate casually. To be realistic, this is a very important new type of agricultural tool in paddy field areas, and it has now been initially trial-produced.
    Chairman Mao warned us to have the intention of seeking truth from facts and not to have the heart of sensationalizing. Over the years, we have generally understood how to practice this lesson. However, the remnants of Party stereotypes and boastful talk cannot be said to have been completely eliminated, and sometimes they will be revealed unconsciously. If you pay attention, you can still find them everywhere. We should eliminate this vulgar practice.

    “合法的”昏话
    吴高伦
    在我们的文章、讲话以及工作报告中，常常有一些顺手或者顺口溜出来的，用列宁的话来说，就是处于“酒醉状态”中的昏话，（这里的“昏话”并没有特别骂人的意思，只是就说这些话时不用思想而言）。这类昏话，你也说，我也说，谁也不敢去改动它，似乎从来也没有人怀疑过它的正确性和合法性似的。但是只要一经点破，就可以看出这类说话，确实是有一点“昏”的。
    这里请允许我举人民日报改版后的几个例子来谈谈吧。
    7月1日人民日报第四版“在首都”一栏内，有一条综合报道说：“旧的北京是一个消费城市，只有少数几个工厂和一些专供剥削阶级享乐的手工业。”这样的话，大家都不感到陌生，似乎和二加二等于四一样地正确。但是这后面的一句话却是属于“昏话”之列的。因为即使旧北京的手工业产品也决不是专供剥削阶级享乐的，它们生产的正是桌椅板凳、锅碗瓢杓之类广大人民日用所需的东西，正像全国一切城乡的手工业一样。北京的几种价值比较昂贵的手工艺品，如像景泰蓝、象牙雕刻、地毯等，虽然不是一般人所能买得起的，但是这几样东西在北京全部手工业中的行业数、从业人员，都只占很小的一部分，而且就是这几样产品也不全是供剥削者享乐的。这种“左”的
  “革命”的词句，在一些人几乎成了顺口溜，但是就不去想想这是多么的违反事实。
    另一个例子，是7月3日人民日报第五版上关于波兹南博览会闭幕消息的一个副标题。那标题说：
  “中波同各国达成巨额交易”。但看内容却是说中国贸易代表同各国代表签订了总额三百五十多万美元的贸易合同。这个数目是进出口都在内的，对象是二十余国，无论从什么角度来看，这都只能说是做了一笔小小的交易，如何能说是“巨额交易”呢？看来，作者在标出“巨额”两个字时，是并没有去管实际数额的多少的，反正非说“巨额”不可。如果成交仅三十五万美元，在有些同志的笔下也未必就不标成“巨额”的吧？
    再一个例子，7月27日人民日报第一版的头条标题，严格说来我以为有几分也是属于这一类的。那条新闻是报道一种“较完善的插秧机试制成功”，主题上的副标题是“水稻耕作机械化又一重要发展”。这里有种种夸大。第一，中国的水稻耕作机械化根本还谈不到，看这标题似乎已经机械化了，现在则是达到“又一重要发展”的新阶段了。其次，这个“机械化的又一重要发展”，却是用一条大水牛来拉的，而且还附有照片说明，这就不能不使人感到这个标题颇有点“幽默”的味道。第三，这个插秧机还有6％—9％的伤秧率。6％—11.3％的漏插率。这个漏插率非同小可，在南方有些地方一人平均不到一亩甚至只有几分水田的地方，漏掉这个数目还是一个大问题。我不是说不应该重视这一个重大的发明创造，而是说不要信口的夸大。实事求是的说，这是水田区的一种非常重要的新式农具，现在已经初步试制成功。
    毛主席告诫我们，要有实事求是之意，无哗众取宠之心，这多年来，我们大体上懂得应该如何去实践这个教训了。但是党八股和夸夸其谈的遗风，不能说是完全肃清了，有时候不知不觉就会流露出来，如果注意，还是到处都可以发现的。我们应该肃清这种庸俗的作法。
