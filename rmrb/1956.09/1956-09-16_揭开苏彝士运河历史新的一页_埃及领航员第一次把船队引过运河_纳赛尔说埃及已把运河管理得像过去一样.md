Xinhua News Agency, September 15th, Cairo Dispatch: Egyptian pilots successfully guided thirty-one ships from Suez City on the Red Sea coast towards Port Said on the Mediterranean this morning.

This marks the first time in the eighty-seven-year history of the Egyptian Suez Canal that Egyptians have been responsible for piloting without foreign interference. This is also the largest convoy to pass through the canal in its history; the previous maximum number of ships in a northbound convoy was twenty-three.

Approximately four hundred pilots, technicians, and employees of various Western nationalities, under the orders of the former International Suez Canal Company, collectively resigned on September 14th. However, this morning's voyage was not affected. The ships were formed into a convoy ahead of schedule. The convoy, including three supertankers and a passenger liner of over 22,000 tons, entered the canal ahead of schedule under a cloudless blue sky.

A total of twenty-six Egyptian pilots and five pilots of other nationalities participated in today's piloting. The vast majority of ships, including a white French oil tanker at the front of the convoy and an 8,000-ton British oil tanker escort vessel, were piloted by Egyptians.

Meanwhile, the departing foreign pilots looked dejected and displeased as they left their ships, hurrying towards the luxurious residences they would be leaving in a day or two.

Some pilots personally bid farewell to Zakaria Sader, Director of the Suez Canal Authority, while others were more cautious and said goodbye by telephone.

Sader said, "Some British and French pilots couldn't help but cry when they said goodbye."

A spokesperson for the Egyptian Canal Authority announced on September 14th that the pilotage work had been completely reorganized. From now on, pilots will guide ships all the way from Suez to Port Said, or from Port Said to Suez, instead of switching halfway in Ismailia.

The Suez Canal Authority also announced that Suez Canal pilots will remain on board for the entire fourteen hours of passage through the canal, instead of the previous seven hours.

Xinhua News Agency, September 15th, Cairo Dispatch: According to a report in the "Republic" newspaper on September 14th, Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser said during a meeting with Mexican painter and journalist Alfaro Siqueiros, "In the past fifty days, we have managed the canal as well as it always has been, and we will continue to do so in the future."

Nasser said, "Not only that, but for the benefit of mankind, we are even prepared to improve management and widen the canal."

Nasser accused exploiters of often saying that others are technically incapable of managing nationalized industries. He said, "The Egyptian people have been bullied by insatiable imperialism for more than seventy years. Now, [Egypt] is determined to defend its independence and sovereignty and transform itself into a modern, fully industrialized nation."

    揭开苏彝士运河历史新的一页
    埃及领航员第一次把船队引过运河
    纳赛尔说埃及已把运河管理得像过去一样
    据新华社15日讯　开罗消息：埃及领航员今天上午顺利地引着三十一条船，从红海岸边的苏彝士城出发，航向地中海畔的塞得港。
    这是埃及苏彝士运河的八十七年历史上第一次不受外国人的干涉，由埃及人负责领航。这也是运河历史上一次通过的最大一批船只，过去北行船队最多的船数是二十三只。
    在前国际苏彝士运河公司命令下，约四百名西方各国国籍的领航员以及其他技术人员和雇员在9月14日实行集体辞职。但是今天上午的航行并没有受到影响。船只还提早编成队。包括有三艘超级油船和两万两千多吨的载客轮船的船队，在万里无云的晴空下提前时间驶入了运河。
    参加今天领航的共有二十六名埃及领航员和五名其他国籍的领航员。绝大多数船只，包括走在船队最前面的一艘白色的法国油船和八千吨的英国油船护航舰都是由埃及人领航。
    同时，离职的外籍领航员离开他们的船只时，神态沮丧而不悦，匆匆走往他们一两天内就要离去的豪华的住屋。
    有些领航员亲自去向苏彝士运河管理局局长扎卡里阿·萨德尔告别，另外有些领航员则较为谨慎以电话告别。
    萨德尔说，“有些英法领航员在告别时忍不住哭泣起来。”
    埃及的运河管理局发言人在9月14日曾宣布，已经完全改组领航员工作。从现在起，领航员将从苏彝士一直引到塞得港，或从塞得港到苏彝士，而不再在伊士美利亚半途调换。
    苏彝士运河管理局还宣布，苏彝士运河领航员将在通过运河的全部十四小时中一直留在船上，而不像以往那样在船上留七个小时。
    新华社15日讯　开罗消息：据“共和国报”9月14日报道，埃及总统阿卜杜勒·纳赛尔在接见墨西哥画家兼记者阿法罗·西凯罗斯时说，“在过去五十天中，我们已经把运河管理得像它过去一向那样，而且我们将来也要继续那样做。”
    纳赛尔说：“不但如此，为了人类的福利，我们甚至还准备改进管理，并且加宽运河。”
    纳赛尔指责剥削者常常说别人在技术方面无法管理收归国有后的工业。他说：“埃及人民受贪得无厌的帝国主义的欺凌已经七十多年了。现在（埃及）决定要保卫自己的独立和主权，并且把它变成一个现代化的、充分工业化的国家。”
