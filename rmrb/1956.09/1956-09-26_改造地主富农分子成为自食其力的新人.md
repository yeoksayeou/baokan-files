Comrade Jia Jun, Secretary of the CPC Changzhi Regional Committee in Shanxi Province, Speaks:

Changzhi Special District in Shanxi Province is an old liberated area. Land reform was completed in 1947, and socialist transformation of agriculture has now been completed. 99.76 percent of farmers in the region have joined advanced agricultural production cooperatives. Here, I would like to talk about the transformation of the original landlord and rich peasant elements.

In the whole region, there were originally 40,200 landlord and rich peasant households, accounting for 6 percent of the total number of farming households; there were 78,000 landlord and rich peasant elements, accounting for 3 percent of the population. Among them, 96.94 percent have been accepted into the cooperatives, of which 80.5 percent have changed their original class status and become farmers, obtaining the title of formal cooperative members; 15.87 percent have been approved by cooperative members' discussions as probationary members; only 3.63 percent, due to varying degrees of offenses, have been placed under the control of the cooperatives for production after discussion by cooperative members and approval by the county people's committee. Currently, 3.06 percent of the original landlord and rich peasant elements remain outside the cooperatives, some of whom have been sentenced to imprisonment for reactionary behavior, while others have gone elsewhere to participate in other labor.

Before the first half of 1955, only more than 1,000 landlord and rich peasant elements were allowed to join cooperatives in the entire region. However, in the high tide of the cooperativization movement in the second half of 1955, they were almost all accepted into the cooperatives. The emergence of such a situation is not accidental. This is the result of a series of sharp and complex class struggles and our implementation of the Party's policy of transforming landlord and rich peasant elements.

As early as the land reform period before 1947, the peasants, under the leadership of our Party, overthrew the ugly landlord class with conscious revolutionary actions like a storm. At that time, our Party's policy towards landlords and rich peasants, as Comrade Deng Zihui said in his speech, adopted a policy of differentiated treatment. Therefore, there was a clear trend of division within the landlord and rich peasant classes. However, the facts of the past few years, as taught by Marxism-Leninism, show that no exploiting class will willingly withdraw from the stage of history. Not to mention that in the first two years after the end of land reform, some landlord and rich peasant elements took advantage of our weak work to launch counterattacks against the peasants, trying every means to turn the wheels of history backward; and in the seven years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, they have also launched several serious struggles against the peasants, our Party, and the state. The first time was from 1950 to 1951, when they took advantage of the Korean War instigated by American imperialism to spread rumors and undermine the just action of the Chinese people to resist America and aid Korea. They also slandered the mutual aid and cooperation movement to the peasants, especially using secret societies to carry out various kinds of sabotage activities. In some places, the secret societies even hid dragon robes and dragon flags, and solemnly dreamed of restoring the feudal dynasty by granting official positions and making promises. The second time was in 1953, when our Party announced the general line for the transition period. A few reactionary elements among them colluded with counter-revolutionaries and took advantage of the fact that a few Party members in our rural areas with relatively wealthy family economies had resentment against the grain purchase and supply policy that was beginning to be implemented at that time, and secretly carried out sabotage activities among the masses.

Even in early 1953, they took advantage of some deviations in our implementation of the Party's policy of uniting with the middle peasants in the mutual aid and cooperation movement, and an attempted conspiracy of riots almost occurred in one county. The third time was in the spring of 1955, when the reactionary elements among them took advantage of the tense atmosphere of grain shortages that once occurred in the countryside at that time to stir up trouble, inciting some wealthy peasants to resist the grain purchase and supply policy, and hindering the advancing cooperativization movement.

What measures did we take in the struggle against the landlord and rich peasant elements? To sum up, there are mainly the following three points: First, combine the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, mobilize the masses, and supervise the activities of landlord and rich peasant elements. In the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, strictly distinguish the sabotage activities of counter-revolutionary elements from the general reactionary words and deeds of landlord and rich peasant elements; distinguish between the law-abiding and law-breaking landlord and rich peasant elements, and treat them differently. In this way, the landlord and rich peasant elements became more and more divided, and the social foundation that counter-revolutionary elements could use became smaller and smaller. Second, in the cooperativization movement and various measures of socialist transformation in rural areas, we adhere to the policy of consolidating and uniting with the middle peasants, and constantly correct "left" or right deviations in actual work; in some specific economic interests in a certain period, we persuade the poor peasants to make necessary concessions to the middle peasants. In this way, the unity of the poor and middle peasants becomes more and more consolidated, which ultimately isolates the landlord and rich peasant elements completely. Third, after the end of land reform, in terms of policy, on the one hand, we allow the existence and development of the rich peasant economy; on the other hand, we actively and steadily develop the cooperativization movement of production, supply and marketing, and credit to achieve the goal of restricting and eliminating the rich peasant economy as a matter of course. Although more than 300 new rich peasant households emerged in the region in the seven years from 1947 to 1953, they still accounted for less than 0.05 percent of the total number of farming households. Therefore, in the cooperativization movement, the rich peasant class did not form a large antagonistic force. Experience has proved that the main difficulty of cooperativization is to solve the ideological problems of the wealthy peasants. Therefore, when all the wealthy peasants acted and joined the cooperatives in the high tide of the cooperativization movement in the second half of 1955, the new rich peasants had to automatically give up exploitation, and the original landlord and rich peasant elements had to submit. In this case, they expressed their desire to join the cooperatives to the peasants. Some declared to the cooperatives: "What I said in the past was all rubbish. Now I write a guarantee to ensure that I will no longer talk nonsense and act recklessly, and obey the leadership obediently." The peasants also treated them differently and absorbed them into the cooperatives according to their past performance, in accordance with the provisions of the "National Agricultural Development Program (Draft)." After they joined the cooperatives, most of them showed gratitude and submission to the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, saying, "Now we can also build socialism together with everyone, which I really never dreamed of in the past."

Is it dangerous to absorb the original landlord and rich peasant elements and new rich peasant elements into the cooperatives? Of course, the danger is not completely absent. In fact, in individual cooperatives, bad elements among them have committed sabotage incidents such as arson, poisoning, and injuring farm animals. However, those who still adhere to the reactionary position are, after all, individual cases. In the first half of this year, the number of cases that disrupted social order in the region decreased by 70 percent compared with the same period last year. Moreover, due to the continuous improvement of the masses' socialist consciousness, even if sabotage cases occur, they are relatively easy to detect. Based on more than half a year of practice, we can see that the vast majority of landlord and rich peasant elements can be transformed into new people who support themselves. Now, those who have joined the cooperatives receive the same treatment as other members, being paid according to their work and receiving equal pay for equal work; those among them who have changed their class status and become farmers and have performed particularly well have been elected by the masses as representatives to the township people's congress. This shows that they have a bright future in economic and political life. We expect that in the next year or two, the original landlord and rich peasant elements and new rich peasant elements can generally be transformed into formal members of the cooperatives. The existing facts fully prove that the Party's policy in this regard is completely correct, and after the original landlord and rich peasant elements and new rich peasant elements are eliminated as a class, they can be transformed into new people who support themselves and are beneficial to the cause of socialist construction.

    改造地主富农分子成为自食其力的新人
    中共山西省长治地方委员会书记　贾俊同志的发言
    山西省长治专区是个老解放区，一九四七年就完成了土地改革，现在又完成了农业的社会主义改造。全区已经有百分之九十九点七六的农户加入了高级农业生产合作社。这里我想谈一谈对原来的地主、富农分子的改造问题。
    全区原来的地主、富农共有四万零二百户，占总农户的百分之六；地主、富农分子共有七万八千人，占人口的百分之三。他们之中，百分之九十六点九四的人已经被接收入社，其中有百分之八十点五的人改变了原来的成份，成为农民，取得了正式社员的称号；有百分之十五点八七的人经过社员公议批准为候补社员；只有百分之三点六三的人因为有过不同程度的罪行，经过社员的公议和县人民委员会的批准，交合作社管制生产。现在，原来的地主、富农分子还有百分之三点零六的人留在社外，其中有的是因为有反动行为被判了徒刑；有的出外参加了其他劳动。
    在一九五五年上半年以前，地主、富农分子被允许入社的，全区只有一千多人。而在一九五五年下半年合作化运动的高潮中，他们就几乎全部被接收到合作社里来了。出现这样的情形并不是偶然的。这是经过了一系列的尖锐复杂的阶级斗争和我们贯彻执行党的改造地主、富农分子的政策的结果。
    远在一九四七年以前的土地改革时期，农民在我们党的领导下，就以狂风暴雨的自觉的革命行动，把丑恶的地主阶级打倒了。当时，我们党对待地主、富农的政策，正如邓子恢同志的发言中所说的那样，采取了区别对待的政策。因而使地主、富农内部有了明显的分化趋势。然而几年来的事实，正如马克思列宁主义所教导我们的，任何剥削阶级决不会心甘情愿地退出历史舞台。姑且不说在土地改革结束后的头一两年中，一部分地主、富农分子利用我们工作薄弱的地方，向农民进行了反攻倒算，千方百计地企图把历史的车轮倒转回去；而且在中华人民共和国成立以来的七年中，他们也曾向农民、向我们党和国家进行过数次严重的斗争。第一次是从一九五○年至一九五一年，他们利用美帝国主义策动的朝鲜战争，大肆造谣，破坏我国人民抗美援朝的正义行动。并且向农民诬蔑互助合作运动，特别是利用会道门进行各种各样的破坏活动。甚至有的地方的会道门，还暗藏着龙袍龙旗，并且封官许愿，煞有介事地做着恢复封建王朝的幻梦。第二次是在一九五三年，当我们党宣布了过渡时期的总路线之后，他们中间的少数反动分子同反革命分子勾结起来，利用我们农村中少数家庭经济较富裕的党员对当时开始实行的粮食统购统销政策抱有抵触情绪，在群众中暗中进行破坏活动。
    甚至在一九五三年初，他们利用我们在互助合作运动中执行党的团结中农政策上的某些偏差，在一个县几乎发生阴谋暴乱的事件。第三次是一九五五年春季，他们中的反动分子，利用当时农村中一度发生的粮食紧张空气，又趁机兴风作浪，煽动一部分富裕农民，抵抗粮食统购统销政策，并且阻挠正在前进着的合作化运动。
    我们在与地主富农分子的斗争中，采取了那些措施呢？概括起来说，主要有如下的三条：一、结合镇压反革命工作，发动群众，监督地主、富农分子的活动。在进行镇压反革命工作中，严格地把反革命分子的破坏行为同地主、富农分子的一般性的反动言行区别开来；把地主、富农分子守法的和不守法的区别开来，加以不同的对待。这样就使地主、富农分子越来越分化，使反革命分子可资利用的社会基础越来越缩小。二、在合作化运动和农村社会主义改造的各项措施中，坚持执行巩固地团结中农的政策，在实际工作中不断地纠正“左”的或右的偏向；在一定时期的某些具体经济利害关系上，说服贫农向中农作必要的让步。这样就使贫农和中农的团结越来越加巩固，从而也就使地主，富农分子最后陷于完全孤立。三、土地改革结束以后，在政策上，一方面允许富农经济的存在和发展；另一方面，又积极地稳步地开展生产、供销、信贷的合作化运动，以达到水到渠成地由限制到消灭富农经济的目的。虽然从一九四七年到一九五三年的七年中，全区出现过三百多户的新富农，但还占不到总农户的万分之五。所以，在合作化运动中，富农阶级就没有形成一个较大的对抗力量。经验证明，合作化的主要困难，是解决富裕农民的思想问题。因此，当一九五五年下半年合作化运动高潮中，全体富裕农民行动起来加入合作社的时候，新富农就不得不自动地放弃剥削，原来的地主、富农分子也不得不屈服了。在这样的情况下，他们纷纷向农民表示要求入社。有的向合作社声明说：“过去我说的话，都是狗皮膏药，现在我写下牛皮文书，保证不再乱说乱动，规规矩矩，服从领导。”农民也根据他们过去的表现好坏，按照“全国农业发展纲要（草案）”的规定，分别对待地把他们吸收到合作社里来。他们入社以后，多数人对共产党和毛主席流露出了感激和诚服的心情，如说：“现在我们也能够和大家一道建设社会主义，真是过去做梦也想不到的。”
    把原来的地主、富农分子和新富农分子都吸收到合作社里来，有没有危险呢？当然，危险并不是完全没有的。事实上，在个别的合作社里，他们中间的坏分子曾有过放火、投毒、伤害耕畜等破坏事件。但是，仍然坚持反动立场的人，毕竟是个别的。今年上半年，全区破坏社会治安的案件，比去年同期减少了百分之七十。而且由于群众社会主义觉悟的不断提高，即使发生了破坏案件，也是比较容易发现的。根据半年多以来的实践，我们可以看到，绝大多数的地主富农分子都是可以改造成为自食其力的新人的。现在，他们已经入社的人同其他社员一样，一律受到按劳取酬、同工同酬的待遇；他们之中已经改变成分成为农民并且表现特别好的，有的已被群众选举为乡人民代表大会的代表。这就表明，他们在经济生活上、政治生活上都有了光明的出路。我们预计，在今后一两年内，原来的地主、农富分子和新富农分子一般都可以改造成为合作社的正式社员。已有的事实充分证明了党在这方面的政策是完全正确的，原来的地主、富农分子和新富农分子作为阶级被消灭之后，是可以改造成为自食其力的新人而有利于社会主义建设事业的。
