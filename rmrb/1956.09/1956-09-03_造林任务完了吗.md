    Is the Afforestation Task Completed?
    This spring, 4.43 million hectares of forests were planted across the country; adding the afforestation area from 1953-1955, the afforestation task of the first Five-Year Plan has been completed ahead of schedule and exceeding the target. This is a great achievement.
    However, this achievement is still very fragile. The afforestation plan is completed, but a more arduous task lies ahead. Just like the series of field management tasks after sowing and transplanting rice seedlings, good tending of young trees is necessary after afforestation to ensure that the saplings truly grow into forests.
    For several years, the most prominent shortcoming in afforestation work has been the low survival rate of trees. According to the inspection in the autumn of 1955, the survival rate of young trees in most provinces was less than 60%, and in some cases even below 50%; even among the surviving young trees, many were not growing vigorously.
    Why is the survival rate of trees so low? In addition to reasons such as unsuitable tree species, low seedling quality, and poor afforestation techniques, the more important reason is the lack of tending and protection of young trees. According to a survey of eight counties including Mingshui and Qinggang in Heilongjiang Province, and four counties including Fuyu and Taonan in Jilin Province, these twelve counties have planted more than 38,436 hectares of forests in recent years, but due to poor tending, the survival rate is only 40.2%. In Wubaihu Village, Ji County, Hebei Province, oil pines were planted on Nanshan Mountain in 1951. Of those without tending, only 10% remain today; those that were tended survived at a rate of 70% and have now grown into a lush forest. In the Guangming Agricultural Production Cooperative in Fei County, Shandong Province, the emergence rate of oak trees planted last winter reached 99% to 100% after tending, and they have grown to seven inches to one foot tall; those without tending had uneven emergence, and those that did emerge were only two to three inches tall.
    Some farmers criticize our afforestation efforts, saying: "Full mountains in spring, half in summer, ignored in autumn, and unseen in winter." This criticism is valid. The leading organs and staff in many areas lack a comprehensive understanding of afforestation work, often satisfied with the vigorous afforestation activities and afforestation figures, while neglecting the tending and protection of young trees after afforestation. Therefore, in these places, weeds are taller than saplings, forest belts become grass belts, and large areas of young trees die. This dampens the enthusiasm of the masses for afforestation and causes serious waste. How can we achieve the task of "greening all possible wastelands and barren mountains within twelve years" if this continues!
    The practice of only liking afforestation figures and not caring about the survival of trees should be stopped quickly! When arranging afforestation tasks, the leading organs of each province and county should not only put forward the area figures for afforestation, but also put forward the survival rate indicators for trees; do not only care about the temporary, vigorous "afforestation movement," but also carefully consider how to tend and protect young trees after afforestation. Only by thinking about and doing all these things can the manpower and material resources used in planting trees and making forests not be wasted.
    Some people fear that "tending young trees will affect agricultural production." It is possible that there are some areas where only the manpower needed for afforestation was considered during the afforestation season, without considering the manpower needed for perennial forestry, so the afforestation plan was too high, and now there are difficulties in allocating manpower for tending young trees. In fact, after the realization of agricultural cooperation, the problem of labor shortage can be solved as long as arrangements are made properly. The Guangming Agricultural Cooperative in Fei County, Shandong Province, not only tended the 300 mu of young trees planted this year, but also tended the young trees planted last winter twice. The labor used for tending young trees only requires one person to work three or four hours per mu; tending three times only requires one to one and a half workdays. Can't the cooperative really spare this little labor and time? The problem now is whether the leadership really attaches importance to this work, whether it educates the masses to understand the relationship between long-term interests and current interests, and whether it uses its brains, thinks of solutions, and fully mobilizes the enthusiasm of the masses.
    We should lead and help various agricultural production cooperatives, forestry production cooperatives, and agricultural, forestry, and livestock production cooperatives to establish a comprehensive production arrangement system. In forestry, a system of perennial contracted work by production teams should also be established: dividing areas, dividing sections, contracting for afforestation, contracting for survival, contracting for replanting, and contracting for tending. If every task has someone responsible for it, agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry can all be done without delay.
    In order to encourage the enthusiasm of cooperative members to engage in forestry production, the cooperative must formulate work quotas for forestry production and reasonably evaluate work points based on the principle of distribution according to work. The practice of making forestry production work points lower than the work points for equal labor in agricultural production, or assigning afforestation and tending as compulsory labor, should be corrected.
    In order to effectively do a good job in tending young trees, each region should determine the tending methods, timing, and frequency according to the local climate, soil, terrain, land preparation methods, and the growth of young trees. There are many things to do in tending young trees, in addition to weeding and loosening the soil, watering, expanding planting pits, building and repairing water barriers, and preventing and controlling pests should be done as needed and as possible. The forestry department should strengthen technical guidance for the tending of young trees, summarize and exchange experiences, and impart technology.
    Currently, it is an important season for tending young trees. Most provinces have begun to arrange this work, and some areas have already taken action. However, many areas still lack strong organizational leadership for this work, and the progress of tending young trees is slow. This phenomenon must be corrected quickly.

### 造林任务完了吗

    造林任务完了吗
    今年春季，全国各地造林四百四十三万公顷；加上1953—1955年的造林面积，第一个五年计划期间的造林任务已经提前超额完成。这是巨大的成绩。
    但是，这种成绩还是很不巩固的。造林计划是完成了；更繁重的任务却还摆在前面。正像播种插秧之后还要进行一系列的田间管理一样，造林之后也必须经过很好的幼林抚育工作，才能使树苗真正生长成林。
    几年以来，造林工作中最突出的缺点就是林木成活率不高。根据1955年秋季的检查，多数省份的幼林成活率不到60％，有的竟在50％以下；已经成活的幼林，也有许多树木长的并不旺盛。
    林木成活率为什么这样低呢？除了树种不适宜、种苗质量低、造林技术不高等原因以外，更重要的原因是对幼林缺乏抚育和保护。据黑龙江省明水、青冈等八县和吉林省扶余、洮南等四县的调查，这十二个县几年来共造林三万八千四百三十六公顷多，由于抚育不好，保存率仅有40.2％。河北省蓟县五百户村1951年在南山种了油松，凡是没有抚育的，现在只剩下10％；凡是经过抚育的，就成活了70％，现在已经蔚然成林。山东省费县光明农业生产合作社去年冬季种的橡树，经过抚育的出苗率达到99％到100％，已经长到七寸到一尺高；没有抚育的出苗不齐，出了苗的也只有两三寸高。
    有的农民批评我们的造林说：“春满山，夏一半，秋不管，冬不见”。这批评是有道理的。许多地区的领导机关和工作人员对于造林工作缺乏全面的认识，常常满足于轰轰烈烈的造林活动和造林数字，而忽视了造林以后的幼林抚育和保护工作。因此，这些地方荒草比树苗高，林带变成草带，幼林大片枯死。这就打击了群众的造林热情，而且造成严重的浪费。这样下去，怎能实现“在十二年内，绿化一切可能绿化的荒地荒山”的任务！
    光喜欢造林数字而不管林木死活的做法应该赶快中止！各省各县的领导机关，在布置造林任务的时候，不可仅仅提出造林的面积数字，还应该同时提出林木成活率的指标；不要只是关心一时的轰轰烈烈的“造林运动”，还应该好好考虑造林以后应该怎样抚育和保护幼林，只有把这些事情都想好了，作到了，植树造林用的人力物力才不致白费。
    有人怕“抚育幼林影响农业生产”。可能有这样一些地区，在造林季节只考虑到造林需要的人力，而没有考虑到常年育林需要的人力，以致造林计划偏高了，现在就发生了抚育幼林调配人力的困难。事实上，实现了农业合作化以后，只要安排得好，劳动力不足的问题是可以解决的。山东省费县光明农业合作社不仅把今年造的三百亩幼林抚育好了，还把去年冬季造的幼林抚育了两遍。抚育幼林用的工，一亩地只要一个人干三、四小时就行了；抚育三次才用一个工到一个半工。难道合作社真的抽不出这一点劳力和时间吗？现在的问题在于领导方面是不是真正重视了这项工作，是不是教育群众认识了长远利益和目前利益的关系，是不是开动脑筋、想了办法、充分发挥了群众的积极性。
    应该领导和帮助各个农业生产合作社、林业生产合作社、农林牧生产合作社建立全面安排生产的制度。在林业方面，也应该建立生产队的常年包工制：分片、分段、包造林、包成活、包补植、包抚育。样样工作都有专人负责，就能做到农业、林业、牧业都不耽误。
    为了鼓励社员从事林业生产的积极性，合作社一定要根据按劳取酬的原则，制定林业生产的工作定额，合理地评工记分。那种使林业生产工分低于农业生产中同等劳动的工分，或者把造林、育林当作义务劳动摊派人工的做法，都应当纠正。
    为了切实做好幼林抚育工作，各个地区应当根据当地气候、土壤、地形、整地方法和幼树生长情况，确定抚育方法、时间和次数。对幼林的抚育要作的事情很多，除锄草、松土以外，要根据需要和可能，浇水、扩大植穴、培修挡水埝、防治虫害。林业部门要加强幼林抚育工作的技术指导，总结和交流经验，传授技术。
    目前正是幼林抚育的重要季节，大多数省份已开始布置这个工作，部分地区已经行动起来。但是许多地区对于这个工作还缺乏有力的组织领导，幼林抚育工作进展迟缓，这种现象要赶快改正。
