    On the Debate Regarding the Classical Drama "Pipa Ji" (The Story of the Lute)
    Yan Zhenfen

    Gao Zecheng's "Pipa Ji" is one of the most debated works of all time. In recent years, in newspaper and magazine reviews, in works on the history of drama, and at review meetings of plays convened by cultural departments in some provinces and cities, there have been many different opinions about this play. In June and July of this year, in order to implement the Party's policy of "Letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," the Chinese Dramatists Association invited literary and art critics, drama scholars, classical literature researchers, historians, actors, directors, newspaper editors, and experts and professors from various places in Beijing to hold seven "Pipa Ji" discussion meetings and one academic lecture to launch a heated discussion on this classical drama.

    The "Pipa Ji" discussion meeting organized by the Chinese Dramatists Association this time was on a large scale, with a total of more than 170 participants. Among them, Tian Han, Shang Yue, Huang Zhigang, Zhou Yibai, Pu Jiangqing, Bai Yunsheng, Li Changzhi, Xu Zhiqiao, Xu Shuofang, Wang Jisi, Dong Meikan, Xu Shaoqing, Zhao Jingshen, Yu Pingbo, Yang Shaoxuan, Zhong Dianfei, Cheng Qianfan, Wang Yao, Li Xifan, Chen Duo, Dong Ni, Deng Shaoji, Ding Li and more than forty others spoke at the meeting. Judging from the overall evaluation of "Pipa Ji," it can be roughly divided into two major schools: those who basically affirm it and those who basically deny it. However, even among those who affirm or deny it, opinions also differ when discussing specific issues.

    The first focus of the debate is the theme of the work. The affirmative and negative factions have very different views on the theme of "Pipa Ji." The affirmative faction believes that the general tendency of "Pipa Ji" is anti-feudal. It exposes the evils of the feudal system, truthfully depicts the suffering of the people at that time, and accuses the feudal ruling class. The negative faction believes that Gao Zecheng's "Pipa Ji" is to promote feudal morality, maintain feudal order, and carry out the teaching of loyalty and filial piety.

    Among the affirmative faction, there are also various different views on the theme of the work. Some comrades believe that "Pipa Ji" points out the contradiction between loyalty and filial piety in feudal society, or that it is using "filial piety" to oppose "loyalty," revealing the contradiction between the feudal system and the people's desire for a happy and fulfilling family. The work reveals the idea of not cooperating with the ruling class at that time, which is of progressive significance. Some comrades also believe that loyalty and filial piety are both feudal morals, and they are unified. "Pipa Ji" does not express the contradiction between loyalty and filial piety, but reveals the hypocrisy of feudal morality and describes the opposition between feudal morality and human nature through the concept of loyalty and filial piety. Some comrades believe that the theme of "Pipa Ji" is diverse. In addition to some feudal preaching, it mainly tells the suffering of the people, exposes the extravagance of the exploiting class, exposes the poison of the imperial examination system, and sings the praises of the kindness of ancient women. Some people also believe that "Pipa Ji" not only expresses sharp class contradictions, but also expresses the contradictions between upper and lower class life, between city and countryside, but also expresses national contradictions, reflecting the historical aspect of "extreme poverty in Jiangnan, wealth boasting in the north" at the end of the Yuan Dynasty. When talking about the theme of the work, some people believe that "Pipa Ji" mainly praises Zhao Wuniang's beautiful and kind virtues.

    The negative faction believes that Gao Zecheng's "Pipa Ji" is to promote feudal morality and is a typical feudal preaching play. The theme of the work is "filial son and virtuous wife." The author obliterates class contradictions, and reconciles all identity oppositions between wife and concubine, poor and rich, high officials and common people. The author writes every character in the play as a good person, in order to illustrate the health of the feudal system at that time. Some people also believe that the tragedy of the Cai family in "Pipa Ji" is basically a headless case, and it is difficult to determine what unified central idea this work has.

    Another focus of the debate is the artistic typicality in "Pipa Ji" and the character portrayal of Cai Bojie, which is closely related to the theme.

    The affirmative faction believes that the portrayal of the main characters in "Pipa Ji" is successful, and the revised character of Cai Bojie after Gao Zecheng's revision is of positive significance. This is a major creation of Gao Zecheng when revising folk tales. The negative faction believes that the more vivid characters in "Pipa Ji" are all from the original folk operas, and the character images after Gao Zecheng's revision have many feudal preaching elements. He changed the "unfaithful and unfilial" Cai Bojie in folk operas into a "completely loyal and filial" positive character, precisely to achieve the purpose of teaching loyalty and filial piety through this character.

    There are various different views on the character of Cai Bojie. Some people believe that in the history of opera, before Gao Zecheng, no one had portrayed the character of intellectuals so meticulously and complexly. This is Gao Zecheng's great artistic achievement. Some people believe that Cai Bojie is a complete positive character. Through the description of the inner contradictions of this character, the author reflects the depressed, wavering, and hesitant psychological state of intellectuals under the racial oppression of the Yuan Dynasty, and also reflects the typical characteristics of intellectuals of that era. Cai Bojie's "three non-compliances"—unwilling to take the examination, unwilling to be an official, and unwilling to remarry—were bold rebellious acts at the time. The author changed Cai Bojie's character, not writing him as a heartless man driven by profit, but as a victim of the feudal system, which is precisely Gao Zecheng's brilliance. Because he attributed the cause of the tragedy from personal condemnation to criticism of the feudal system and the feudal ruling class, he deepened the contradictions of the script. Some people also believe that Gao Zecheng's writing of Cai Bojie as a different type from Chen Shimei and Wang Shipeng is precisely the expression of his originality in art.

    However, the negative faction holds the opposite view. They believe that Cai Bojie under Gao Zecheng's pen is not real. In order to promote feudal morality, and for the happy ending of the work, the author arbitrarily tampered with the character of Cai Bojie in the "Old Song and Yuan Dynasties", rewriting the unfaithful and unfilial negative character into a completely loyal and filial positive character, attempting to use "three non-compliances" to exonerate Cai Bojie's sins, which is to defend the feudal system. Some people also believe that Gao Zecheng's modification of Cai Bojie's character was to reverse the verdict for Cai Yong, a famous writer of the Han Dynasty, and to defend the old intellectuals who "abandoned their parents and wives" at that time. The character of Cai Bojie is "pale and powerless." Gao Zecheng's modification of this character makes the tragedy of the Cai family a "headless case." Some people also pointed out that there are many flaws in Cai Bojie's character portrayal, such as why he did not resign from marriage when he resigned from office, and why he did not welcome and care for his parents. These flaws affect the authenticity of the character.

    In this discussion, the character of Zhao Wuniang was not fully discussed. At the discussion meeting, most comrades unanimously believed that the character of Zhao Wuniang was well written. Some people believed that she was a "brilliant positive character image" with noble qualities and beautiful character, and she possessed the virtues of the people. A few comrades believed that she was a chaste and virtuous woman in feudal society, a typical "filial wife and virtuous wife," a woman captured by feudal ethics, a victim of feudal morality, or believed that she was a tragic character who unconsciously served the feudal system. Zhao Wuniang occupies a very important position in "Pipa Ji". It can be seen that the author described and praised this character with sympathy and love. A more in-depth and detailed analysis and discussion of this character's personality will help to understand the theme of this play. The failure to launch a more in-depth discussion and research on this character is a shortcoming of this stage of the discussion.

    Another focus of the discussion was Gao Zecheng's adaptation and the ending of "Pipa Ji".

    The affirmative faction believes that Gao Zecheng's adaptation was successful, not only artistically processing the original folk tales, but also making the thoughts of the script more profound. The negative faction believes that Gao Zecheng's adaptation changed a work with strong popular character into an anti-realistic work that whitewashes reality, which is a tampering of folk operas by feudal literati.

    The main argument that Gao Zecheng's adaptation was successful is: the author changed the ending of "Ma trampling Zhao Wuniang, Lei striking Cai Bojie" in folk operas to a happy ending, which did not reconcile the contradictions, but shifted the contradictions from between Cai and Zhao to between Cai Yong and Prime Minister Niu and the emperor, precisely revealing the evils of the feudal system through a tragic happy ending. The main opinions of the negative faction are: the ending of folk operas is clear about love and hate, and severely punishes the ungrateful Cai Bojie, which expresses the simple wishes of the people, so the popular character is very strong. Gao Zecheng's adaptation obliterates class contradictions and whitewashes real life. The happy ending is forcibly added by the author and does not conform to the development of the characters' personalities. Among those who basically affirm "Pipa Ji", some people also believe that the happy ending is not good and weakens the ideological significance of the work; the "memorial of the entire family" and "happy reunion" in "Pipa Ji" praise the emperor's grace and express the limitations of the writer's worldview, as well as the author's "hitting and rubbing" thoughts on the feudal system. However, some people also study the happy ending in the work from the perspective of the prevailing social atmosphere, literary trends, and audience preferences at the time, believing that the author could not but deal with it in this way at that time.

    The above briefly introduces several focuses that aroused controversy in the "Pipa Ji" discussion. Although it is far from summarizing the various views at the discussion meeting, it can be seen from this brief introduction that the discussion on "Pipa Ji" involves many important issues in current literary and artistic theory.

    Now, the first stage of the "Pipa Ji" discussion has ended. Judging from the situation of the discussion, certain achievements have been made. Due to the implementation of the policy of "Letting a hundred schools of thought contend," the spirit of democratic and free discussion was fully promoted at the discussion meeting. Although the opinions of the affirmative and negative factions were diametrically opposed, they respected each other and humbly explored the truth. The comrades who denied "Pipa Ji," who were in the minority, did not feel any "pressure" and were able to express their opinions freely without any scruples. This discussion meeting also proved that only by arguing with each other can issues be studied more deeply.

    In the first stage of the "Pipa Ji" discussion, there was more debate about the question of affirming or denying the work "Pipa Ji" itself. As for the many fundamental issues in current literary and artistic theory involved in the discussion, and the questions raised by some comrades regarding the research methods of classical literature, they all need to be further studied. Because there are many complex works similar to "Pipa Ji" in classical works, the issues raised in the "Pipa Ji" discussion have universal significance for studying other classical dramas, so it is necessary to further expand the discussion. In the first stage of the discussion, due to the contradiction between the meaning of the artistic image created by Gao Zecheng in the work and the creative intention he declared in the opening, the relationship between the world view and creative methods of classical writers, the writer's subjectivity and the objectivity of the work has been touched upon. Due to the analysis of the more complex artistic images such as Cai Bojie and Zhao Wuniang, many important aspects of the typicality problem have been touched upon. Due to the evaluation of the merits and demerits of Gao Zecheng's adaptation of "Pipa Ji", the relationship and views between folk literature and literati works have also been touched upon. Due to the study of the happy ending of "Pipa Ji", the characteristics of tragedy and comedy, and the relationship between works and literary trends have also been involved. In addition, it also involves how to understand the feudalism and popular character in classical works, how to analyze classical works from a historical perspective, how to treat the classical literary heritage, and also involves some issues in current literary and artistic criticism. These issues need to be further discussed.

    In the first stage of the discussion, there were fewer speeches by playwrights. Therefore, while engaging in academic discussions, there was not more analysis and research of this classical work from the perspective of play creation, and there was not more analysis of the characteristics of this work in terms of theme refinement, character creation, construction of dramatic conflicts, writing techniques of singing lyrics and dialogues. These are what we need in today's play creation. These issues also need to be studied in the next stage.

    We believe that further discussion of the classical Chinese drama "Pipa Ji" will have a certain positive impact on our current drama research work, literary and artistic theory work, and current play creation work.

    关于古典剧作“琵琶记”的争论
    颜振奋
    高则诚的“琵琶记”是历来争论最多的一部作品。近几年来在报刊的评论文章或戏剧史的著作中以及在有些省市文化部门召开的剧目审订会上，关于这部剧作也有许多不同的意见。今年六、七月间，中国戏剧家协会为了贯彻党的“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针，邀请在京的文艺理论批评家、戏曲学者、古典文学研究者、历史家、演员、导演、报刊编辑以及各地来京的专家教授举行了七次“琵琶记”讨论会和一次学术讲座，展开了对这部古典剧作的热烈讨论。
    中国戏剧家协会这次组织的“琵琶记”讨论会规模是较大的，参加讨论的共有一百七十多人，在会上发言的有田汉、尚钺、黄芝冈、周贻白、浦江清、白云生、李长之、许之乔、徐朔方、王季思、董每戡、徐绍清、赵景深、俞平伯、杨绍萱、钟惦棐、程千帆、王瑶、李希凡、陈多、冬尼、邓绍基、丁力等四十多人。从对“琵琶记”的总的评价看来，大致可以分为基本上肯定和基本上否定的两大派。但同是肯定或同是否定的人们中间，在讨论到一些具体问题时，意见也是分歧的。
    首先引起争论的焦点是作品的主题思想。肯定派与否定派对“琵琶记”的主题思想的看法是很分歧的。肯定派认为“琵琶记”总的倾向是反封建的，它暴露了封建制度的罪恶，真实地描写了当时人民生活的苦难，对封建统治阶级进行了控诉；否定派则认为高则诚的“琵琶记”是宣扬封建道德、维护封建秩序，进行教忠教孝的。
    肯定派之间对作品的主题思想也有各种不同的看法，有的同志认为“琵琶记”指出了封建社会中忠与孝的矛盾，或者认为它是以“孝”反“忠”，揭示了封建制度与人民所要求的幸福美满家庭的矛盾的，作品里流露了不和当时统治阶级合作的思想，是有进步意义的。也有些同志认为忠孝都是封建道德，它们之间是统一的，“琵琶记”不是表现忠与孝的矛盾，而是通过忠孝的概念揭露了封建道德的虚伪性，描写了封建道德与人性的对立；有些同志认为“琵琶记”的主题是多样的，它除了夹杂一些封建说教以外，主要是倾诉了人民生活的苦难、揭露了剥削阶级的骄奢，暴露了科举制度的毒害，歌颂了古代妇女的善良等等。也有人认为“琵琶记”不仅表现了尖锐的阶级矛盾，表现了上层生活与下层生活、城市与乡村的矛盾，同时也表现民族矛盾，反映了元末“贫极江南、富夸塞北”的历史面貌。谈到作品的主题思想时，也有人认为“琵琶记”主要是歌颂赵五娘美好善良的品德的。
    否定派则认为高则诚的“琵琶记”是宣扬封建道德的，是典型的封建说教戏。作品的主题思想是“子孝共妻贤”，作者抹杀了阶级矛盾，调和了妻与妾、贫与富、高官与平民的一切身份对立，作者把戏里每个人物都写成好人，是想借此来说明当时封建制度的健康性，等等。也有人认为“琵琶记”中蔡家的悲剧根本是一件无头公案，很难确定这部作品有什么统一的中心思想。
    争论较为热烈的另一焦点是“琵琶记”中的艺术典型以及与主题思想有密切关系的蔡伯喈的性格描写问题。
    肯定派认为“琵琶记”中主要人物形象的刻划都是成功的，高则诚改写以后的蔡伯喈性格是有积极意义的，这正是高则诚修改民间传说时的重大创造。否定派认为“琵琶记”中较为生动的人物形象是原来民间戏曲中所有的，高则诚改写后的人物形象则存在着许多封建说教成分，他把民间戏曲中“不忠不孝”的蔡伯喈改为“全忠全孝”的正面人物，正是有意通过这个人物来达到教忠教孝的目的。
    对于蔡伯喈这个人物形象有各种不同的看法，有人认为在戏曲史上，在高则诚之前还没有人把知识分子的性格刻划得这样细致和复杂，这是高则诚艺术上伟大的成就。有人认为蔡伯喈是完整的正面人物，作者通过对这个人物内心矛盾的描写，反映了元代种族压迫下知识分子的苦闷、动摇和彷徨的心理状态，也反映了那个时代知识分子的典型特征。蔡伯喈的“三不从”，不愿应试，不愿做官和再婚，在当时是大胆的反抗行为。作者改变蔡伯喈的性格，不把他写成利欲熏心的负心汉，而写成封建制度下的牺牲者，这正是高则诚高明之处。因为他把造成悲剧的原因从对个人的谴责归结为对封建制度及封建统治阶级的批判，把剧本的矛盾更加深刻化了。也有人认为高则诚把蔡伯喈写成与陈世美、王十朋不同的典型，正是他在艺术上的独创性的表现。
    但否定派持相反的意见，他们认为高则诚笔下的蔡伯喈是不真实的，作者为了宣扬封建道德，为了作品结尾的大团圆，任意篡改了“宋元旧篇”中的蔡伯喈的性格，把不忠不孝的反面人物改写为全忠全孝的正面人物，企图以“三不从”去开脱蔡伯喈的罪恶，这是为封建制度辩护。也有人认为高则诚修改蔡伯喈的性格是为了替汉朝著名的文学家蔡邕翻案，并借以为当时“弃亲背妇”的旧知识分子辩护。蔡伯喈这个人物形象是“苍白无力”的，高则诚修改了这个人物的性格，使蔡家的悲剧化为“无头公案”。也有人指出蔡伯喈性格刻划上有许多破绽，如辞官时为什么不辞婚，为什么不迎养双亲，这些破绽影响了人物的真实性。
    在这次讨论中，关于赵五娘这个人物，没有展开充分的讨论。在讨论会上，大部分同志都一致认为赵五娘这个人物是写得较好的，有人认为她是“光辉的正面人物形象”，有高贵的品质和美好的性格，在她身上存在着人民的美德。也有个别同志认为她是封建社会中的贞烈妇女，是“孝妇贤妻”的典型，是一个被封建礼教所俘虏的妇女、封建道德的牺牲者，或者认为她是不自觉地为封建制度服务的悲剧人物。赵五娘在“琵琶记”中占很主要的地位，可以看出作者是满怀着同情和热爱描写了歌颂了这个人物的。对这个人物的性格进行更深入更细致的分析、讨论，将有助于了解这部剧作的主题。这一阶段的讨论，没有在这个人物身上展开更深入的讨论研究，是它的不够的地方。
    引起讨论会争论的又一个焦点是高则诚的改编问题和“琵琶记”结尾的团圆问题。
    肯定派认为高则诚的改编是成功的，不但对原来的民间传说在艺术上有了加工，而且剧本的思想更加深刻了。否定派认为高则诚的改编是把人民性较强的作品改为粉饰现实的反现实主义的作品，是封建士大夫文人对于民间戏曲的篡改。
    认为高则诚的改编是成功的的主要论点是：作者把民间戏曲中“马踹赵五娘、雷击蔡伯喈”的结局改为团圆的结局，不是调和了矛盾，而是把矛盾从蔡赵之间移到蔡邕与牛丞相和皇帝之间，恰恰是通过悲剧性的团圆来揭露封建制度的罪恶的。否定派的主要意见则是：民间戏曲的结局爱憎分明，对忘恩负义的蔡伯喈作了严厉的惩罚，表现了人民朴素的愿望，因而人民性是很强烈的，而高则诚的改编则抹杀了阶级矛盾，粉饰了现实生活，团圆的结尾是作者生硬加上去的，不符合人物性格的发展。在基本上肯定“琵琶记”的人中，也有人认为大团圆不好，削弱了作品的思想意义；“琵琶记”中的“一门旌表”“大团圆”歌颂皇恩浩荡，表现了作家世界观的局限性，也表现作者对封建制度“打一把，揉一把”的思想。但也有人从当时的时代风气、文艺思潮、观众的爱好来研究作品中的大团圆，认为作者当时不能不这样处理。
    以上简单介绍了“琵琶记”讨论中引起争论的几个焦点，虽然远没有概括讨论会上的各种看法，但从这个简单介绍中可以看出关于“琵琶记”的讨论是涉及到当前文艺理论上的许多重要问题的。
    现在，“琵琶记”的第一阶段的讨论已经结束。从讨论的情况看来，是获得了一定成绩的。由于贯彻执行了“百家争鸣”的方针，在讨论会上充分发扬了民主自由讨论的精神，肯定派与否定派虽然意见针锋相对，但彼此互相尊重，虚心探讨真理。人数占少数的否定“琵琶记”的同志没有感到任何“压力”，都能毫无顾忌地畅所欲言。这次讨论会也证明，只有各种不同意见互相争论，才能使问题研究得更加深入。
    “琵琶记”第一阶段的讨论，争论比较多的，还是有关肯定或否定“琵琶记”这部作品本身的问题，至于讨论中涉及到的当前文艺理论上许多带有根本性的问题，以及有些同志提出的有关古典文学研究方法等问题，都有待于再作进一步的研究。由于在古典作品中类似“琵琶记”这样复杂的作品很多，“琵琶记”讨论中提出的问题对研究其他古典剧作也有普遍的意义，因此讨论有必要再进一步展开。第一阶段的讨论中，由于涉及到高则诚在作品中所创造的艺术形象的意义和他在开场中所宣称的创作意图的矛盾，已经接触了古典作家的世界观与创作方法、作家的主观与作品的客观的关系问题；由于分析了蔡伯喈、赵五娘等较为复杂的艺术形象，已经接触到典型问题的许多重要方面；由于评价了高则诚改编“琵琶记”的功过，也接触到对民间文学和文人作品之间的关系和看法的问题；由于研究了“琵琶记”的结尾大团圆，也涉及到悲剧与喜剧的特征，作品与文艺思潮的关系问题。此外也涉及到如何理解古典作品中的封建性与人民性，如何以历史观点去分析古典作品，如何对待古典文学遗产等问题，同时还涉及到当前文艺批评上的一些问题，这些问题都有待进一步展开讨论。
    在第一阶段的讨论中，剧作家的发言较少，因此在学术讨论的同时，没有更多从剧本创作的角度去分析研究这部古典作品，没有更多地分析这部作品在题材提炼、人物创造、戏剧冲突的构成、唱词与对白等写作技巧上的特点，而这些却是我们今天剧本创作上所需要的。这些问题也有待于下一阶段的研究。
    我们相信，进一步讨论我国古典剧作“琵琶记”，对于我们今天剧目研究工作、文艺理论工作以及当前的剧本创作工作都会起一定的积极影响。
