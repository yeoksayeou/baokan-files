    Tangshan Steel Plant Increases Steel Production by More Than 2,000 Tons
    Liaoning Province Youth Recovers 10,000 Tons of Steel and Nearly 1,000 Tons of Cement

    This newspaper reports that from January to August 30 this year, the Tangshan Steel Plant has increased the nation's steel production by more than 2,300 tons. This steel includes agricultural steel for making double-wheeled double-shared plows, square steel for making track spikes, rebar for construction projects, and round steel for export.

    The steelworkers at this plant increased steel production by continuously improving equipment and learning advanced experience. By using the Soviet advanced experience of rolling within tolerance limits, they increased steel production by more than 420 tons. In the early stage of rolling agricultural flat steel, not only was the production plan not completed, but the quality was also poor. Shift leader Bo Shuchang and the steelworkers squatted anxiously beside the rolling mill, staring at the rolling mill and pondering, and finally discovered that there was a problem with the "hole pattern." They suggested that the leaders improve the equipment of the "hole pattern," and as a result, the agricultural steel rolled out was of good quality, and the hourly output increased by more than 27%. Under the condition of continuously improving equipment, they produced 24 kinds of new steel for the country.

    Recently, the employees of Tangshan Steel Plant also proposed: from September to the end of the year, to increase the country's steel production by another 1,800 tons, the employees have launched a competition around this goal to increase the production of high-quality steel.

    Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, September 9th. According to incomplete statistics, young people in seven cities including Shenyang, Anshan, and Fushun have saved and recovered more than 10,400 tons of steel and more than 900 tons of cement in four months.

    In carrying out savings activities, young people in various places have found ways to save steel for the country from all aspects. After the young people in the hull workshop of Dalian Shipyard tried to control the issuance of steel according to drawings, they saved more than three tons of steel in just one instance. The young people of the riveting and welding group of Shenyang Mining Machinery Factory used substitute materials for 135 working days, saving more than 42 tons of steel. Chen Yuzang, a young engineer at Shenyang No. 2 Machine Tool Plant, also reduced the amount of steel used by improving the structure of the boring machine bed. Many young people have also promoted advanced experiences such as cold-rolled, cold-drawn, cold-drawn rebar and dry-hard concrete, saving a large number of rebar and cement for the country.

    Young people in various places also actively participated in the activities of recovering scrap iron and steel. After the young people of Shenyang No. 2 Machine Tool Plant cleaned up the accumulated scrap iron and steel on the ground, they dug up steel ingot molds and pig iron plates totaling 360 tons from the ground according to reliable clues provided by veteran workers. The 724 Factory dug up a broken tank and round steel from the old air-raid shelter before liberation. Many factories and mines have established savings manuals, savings boxes, and savings warehouses. They first register the things that are saved and recycled, then put them in the savings box, and finally hand them over to the savings warehouse.

    唐山钢厂增产钢材二千多吨
    辽宁省青年回收万吨钢材和近千吨水泥
    本报讯　唐山钢厂从今年1月到8月30日，已给国家增产了二千三百多吨钢材。这些钢材有制造双轮双铧犁的农具钢，有制造道钉用的方钢，有建筑工程用的螺纹钢，还有出口的元钢材。
    这个厂的轧钢工人们是在不断改进设备，学习先进经验中增产钢材的。他们运用苏联轧副公差的先进经验，就增产了四百二十多吨钢材。在轧制农具扁钢的初期，不仅产量计划完不成，质量也不好。值班长薄淑昌和轧钢工人们，焦急地蹲在轧钢机旁，两眼盯着轧钢机琢磨，终于发现“孔型”有毛病。他们建议领导改进了“孔型”的设备，结果轧出的农具钢规格良好，小时产量提高了27％以上。他们在不断改进设备的条件下为国家生产了二十四种新钢材。
    最近，唐山钢厂职工又提出：从9月份到年底再为国家增产一千八百吨钢材，职工们已围绕这个奋斗目标展开增产质量优良钢材的竞赛。
    新华社沈阳9日电　据不完全统计，沈阳、鞍山、抚顺等七个城市的青年在四个月内就节约、回收钢材一万零四百多吨，水泥九百多吨。
    各地青年在开展节约活动中，从各方面想办法为国家节约钢材。大连造船公司船体车间的青年试用按图纸控制钢材发放制度后，仅一次就节约三吨多钢材。沈阳矿山机械厂铆焊组的青年利用代用材料工作了一百三十五个工作日，节约钢材达四十二吨多。沈阳第二机床厂青年工程师陈玉藏由于改进了镗床床身结构，也减少了钢材的使用量。许多青年还推广了冷轧、冷拉、冷拔钢筋和干硬性混凝土等先进经验，为国家节省了大批钢筋和水泥。
    各地青年还积极参加回收废钢铁的活动。沈阳第二机床厂的青年把地面上积存的废钢铁回收干净后，又根据老工人提供的可靠的线索，从地下挖出钢锭模和生铁板共三百六十吨。七二四厂在解放前的旧防空壕内挖出了一辆已坏了的坦克和圆钢等物。许多厂矿都建立了节约手册、节约箱和节约仓库。他们把节约回收的东西先进行登记，然后放进节约箱，最后再交到节约仓库。
