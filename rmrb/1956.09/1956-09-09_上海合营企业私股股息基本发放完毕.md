    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, September 7th. Shanghai's public-private joint venture enterprises have basically completed the distribution of private share dividends for the first half of the year. As of the end of August, 47,295 enterprises had paid out more than 25.31 million yuan in dividends.

    This time, regardless of whether the enterprise made a profit or loss, private share dividends were paid at a uniform annual interest rate of five percent. Some older joint venture enterprises maintained their original higher private share dividend levels. All joint venture enterprises have simplified procedures and expedited payments of dividends. Enterprises with insufficient funds were coordinated by specialized companies or bureaus, and those with coordination difficulties obtained loans from the People's Bank for distribution. Some enterprises remitted dividends to private shareholders residing in other places or to the families of overseas Chinese shareholders in the countryside.

    Some shareholders residing in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and abroad have already entrusted agents to collect their dividends for the first half of this year. The remaining uncollected dividends are being temporarily held by the joint venture enterprises or entrusted to the Shanghai Communications Bank for safekeeping. According to the Communications Bank and various joint venture enterprises, these shareholders can authorize relatives and friends to collect the dividends at any time, or come in person to collect them.

    上海合营企业私股股息基本发放完毕
    新华社上海7日电　上海市公私合营企业上半年的私股股息基本上发放完毕。到8月底止，已有四万七千二百九十五户企业付出股息二千五百三十一万多元。
    这次不论企业盈亏，都一律按年息五厘付给私股股息，有的老合营企业原来私股股息较高的，仍然保持原有水平。所有合营企业的股息发付工作，都做到手续简便、发放迅速。资金不足的企业由专业公司或专业局统筹调剂，调剂有困难的就向人民银行贷款发放。有些企业对居住在外地的私股股东或在乡下的华侨股东家属，把股息汇给他们。
    现在居住在台湾、香港和国外的股东们，已有一部分委托代理人领到了今年上半年股息。其余尚未领取的，各合营企业暂时代为保管，或者委托上海市交通银行代管。据交通银行和各合营企业表示，这些股东随时可以委托亲友代领，或亲自前来领取。
