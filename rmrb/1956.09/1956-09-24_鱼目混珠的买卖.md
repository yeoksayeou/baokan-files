The Guangxi Provincial Chemical Raw Materials Company ordered six thousand tons of alum from Zhejiang Province this April. What did Guangxi Province need so much alum for?

It turned out that the farmers in Guangxi Province were very fond of using ammonium chloride (a kind of chemical fertilizer) to fertilize their fields, but this fertilizer had already sold out. The Guangxi Provincial Chemical Raw Materials Company came up with a "business-minded" method. They thought that the color and shape of alum were similar to ammonium chloride, so they purchased a large amount of alum to pass off as ammonium chloride, engaging in the deceptive trade of passing off fish eyes for pearls.

After the alum was put on the market, farmers did rush to buy it. However, when they poured load after load of bright "fertilizer" into the fields, they found that these "fertilizers" had no effect, and the seedlings were still deficient in nutrients. Then, calculating the cost, this "fertilizer" cost fifteen yuan per load, equivalent to the price of two loads of grain. This money (the sweat and blood of the farmers' labor) was spent in vain, how could it not be infuriating!

The bottom of "alum" or "fertilizer" was exposed, so various places demanded returns; however, the alum still flooded into Guangxi like an angry tide.

How much transportation power was needed to transport six thousand tons of alum from Zhejiang to Guangxi? How much warehouse space will the accumulation of six thousand tons of alum occupy? The exact amount of loss caused to the country by this deceptive trade, and the extent of loss suffered by agricultural production and farmers, has not yet been precisely calculated. However, the shameful behavior of the Guangxi Provincial Chemical Raw Materials Company in resorting to any means to obtain profits is very obvious. The Guangxi Provincial Department of Commerce and the China Chemical Raw Materials Company must seriously handle this matter.

    鱼目混珠的买卖
    李芳春
    今年四月，广西省化工原料公司在浙江省订购了六千吨明矾。广西省要这么多明矾干什么呢？
    原来，广西省农民十分欢喜用氯化铵（一种化学肥料）肥田，但是这种肥料早已脱销了。广西省化工原料公司想出了一个“生财有道”的办法，他们以为明矾的色泽、形状和氯化铵相类似，于是大量购进明矾冒充氯化铵，干起了鱼目混珠的买卖来。
    明矾上市后，农民确实争先购买。可是，当他们把一担一担雪亮的“肥料”倒进田里的时候，发现这些“肥料”毫无效果，禾苗仍然是那样缺乏营养；再计算一下成本吧，这种“肥料”每担十五元，相当两担谷子的价钱。这些钱（农民劳动的血汗）白白地花了，那能不令人愤慨！
    是“明矾”还是“肥料”的底被揭穿了，于是各地纷纷要求退货；但是，明矾还是像怒潮一样的涌来广西。
    六千吨明矾由浙江运到广西，需要多大的运输力量？六千吨明矾的积压，又要占用多少库房？这一笔鱼目混珠的买卖，究竟给国家造成了多大的损失，使农业生产和农民遭到了多大损失，现在还没有精确的计算出来。但是，广西省化工原料公司为了获得利润而不择手段的可耻行为，是十分明显的。广西省商业厅和中国化工原料公司必须严肃处理这件事情。
