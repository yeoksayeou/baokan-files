    Longjing Autumn Tea Being Picked
    (Xinhua News Agency) The season for picking autumn tea in the Longjing tea region has arrived. In the northwest of Hangzhou city, among the dark green tea bushes from Lion Peak to Tiger Spring, thousands of women are picking newly sprouted tender leaves every day. In the past few days, the tea region's purchasing stations have been receiving an average of sixty dan of tea leaves daily. The quality of the new tea leaves is generally one grade higher than last year. According to the purchasing station's estimate, this year's autumn tea production could reach one thousand six hundred dan, an increase of more than one-half compared to last year.
    Longjing tea is famous for its excellent color, aroma, and taste, and can be harvested in spring, summer, and autumn. Because the tea trees grow short and dense, when the strong typhoon hit in early August, the vast majority were not damaged, except for a very few high mountain tea trees.

    龙井秋茶在采摘
    据新华社讯　龙井茶区采摘秋茶的季节到来了。在杭州市区西北，狮峰到虎跑一带乌油油的茶丛里，每天有上千妇女在采摘新吐的嫩叶。这几天，茶区的收购站每日平均收进六十担茶叶。新茶叶的质量普遍比去年提高一级。根据收购站的估计，今年秋茶产量可以达到一千六百担，比去年增加二分之一以上。
    龙井茶以色香味俱佳著名，春、夏、秋三季都可以采摘。由于茶树长得矮密，8月初强台风袭来的时候，除了极少数高山茶树以外，绝大部分没有受到损害。
