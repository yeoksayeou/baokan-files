    The Vanguard in the Forest
    By Our Special Correspondent　Lǜ Fěi
    As soon as I arrived in Nenjiang County, every household's doors and windows were adorned with small triangular red flags, signaling fire prevention! It was like a solemn order, and instantly, no more smoke rose from the chimneys of any house. The fierce wind howled, whipping up gray dust that filled the streets, making it hard to breathe. Just as I was feeling uneasy, the comrade in charge of the forest management survey team's transit station greeted me and introduced me to an old man—this man's hair was already half white, his back was hunched, and he walked very slowly. A Mongolian knife scabbard hung from his right waist, swaying back and forth. He looked at least fifty years old. But his shining eyes and rosy cheeks were really out of proportion to his age. The comrade from the transit station told me that this was the man sent by the brigade headquarters to go up the mountain with me, called Old Liu Tou, and the team members all called him Grandpa Liu. I found it very strange. I had originally heard that the survey team members were all energetic young men, capable of enduring heat, humidity, and cold, self-proclaimed as people cast from "stainless steel." Why would they need such an old man? It might not even be useful for him to go up the mountain with me?
    Early in the morning, I was full of energy and preparing to set off when Old Liu Tou suddenly ran in, blurting out, "There's a fire, and you're not calling me to put it out!" I didn't understand what he meant. I hurriedly went out to look, only to see the street deserted, with only some of the old and weak doing business. Old Liu Tou said behind me, "People, horses, carts, all set off in the middle of the night. The fire prevention headquarters wouldn't let me go, saying I was too old." I turned around and comforted him, "It's not very convenient for you to go put out fires at your age!" Old Liu Tou snorted, turned around, and walked out the door. The comrade from the transit station standing next to me gently tugged at my sleeve and quietly said, "Grandpa Liu is proud. He can't stand hearing that. Don't look at him swaying when he walks on flat ground. When it comes to climbing mountains and crossing ridges, three young men can't keep up with him. He used to be a 'black person' in the old forest, but now he's the vanguard of our team. In the past few years, he's created quite a few model deeds in the team!"
    All day, I didn't see Old Liu Tou again, and traffic was cut off, so I couldn't leave for a while. In the evening, the comrade from the transit station came to chat with me, and we slowly talked about Old Liu Tou's deeds—
    Old Liu Tou was from Shandong, and he was tricked into coming to the Northeast by the puppet regime to work as a coolie. As soon as he arrived in the Northeast, he dreamt of earning enough money to return to his hometown. But there was no extra money; it was hard enough just to stay alive! Finally, the enemy wanted to force him into the army, so Old Liu Tou ran empty-handed into the old forest. He never expected that once he was in the old forest, he would become a "black person," with no household registration and no "labor ticket," and he could never leave the forest again. In the forest, he lived in a wooden house he built himself. Half of the house was buried in the ground, and the roof sloped down along the hillside, covered with soil and overgrown with grass. From a distance, it looked like a small hill. This was the same as the secret camps of the Anti-Japanese Allied Army back then. He had encountered mountain torrents, strong winds felling trees, and fierce wildfires spreading, but he had escaped all the dangers. He wanted to live, waiting for the day when he could go to a city or village under the sunlight, where he could live a happy life.
    In the old forest, in the spring, he would take a dog out to dig fritillaria bulbs, in the summer he would dig ginseng, and in the autumn he would pick mushrooms and edible wild herbs. In the winter, he would take all three dogs out to trap wild animals. When it snowed heavily, he would follow the footprints of wild boar herds and set traps to catch "pig keepers" (tigers). In the early morning mist, he would catch black bears bathing by the river... He moved from this forest to that forest. He might go down the mountain once a year to sell the fur, but because he was a "black person," he could only entrust others to sell the goods for him. After several middlemen, the money he got was barely enough to buy some grain and salt to take back up the mountain. Fortunately, in the old forest, he always kept "fire seed" buried, so he didn't need matches. He never lacked oil or meat throughout the year. When his clothes were torn, he would mend them with roe deer skin and sew them with hemp rope...
    After liberation, he moved out of the old forest, and his name was on the household registration book. But he couldn't get used to living in the village. He felt that the village was stuffy and chaotic, and he would get lost on the streets. At this time, he dreamed again of the wild fruits and wild grass in the old forest... In 1951, the forest management survey team was looking for temporary workers, and they found him at once. As soon as he arrived in the old forest, he became younger and full of energy. He worked as a watchman in the team, going from this tent to that tent, making fires and adding firewood. During the day, when the team members left, he would take their quilts out to air them and wash their shoes, mending them if they were torn. If a team member had a stomachache or a headache, he would use deer bone chopsticks to pick up ointment and feed it to them. He taught people how to live in the old forest, how to avoid getting sick, and what to do when they encountered wild animals... He was like an encyclopedia. Anyone with a problem would ask him, and he slowly became everyone's Grandpa Liu.
    After Old Liu Tou became a permanent worker, the team often entrusted him with difficult tasks. He couldn't read a word, but he could take a rough map and lead people into the old forest to draw the survey boundary lines, and he could calculate how many days it would take and how much food they should bring. After setting off, he could find water sources at the location where they were supposed to camp for the night, and he could start a fire in the wet old forest to prevent fires. At night, he would let others rest, while he leaned against a tree root and guarded the fire, making sure it didn't go out. Before dawn, he would add fuel to the fire, boil water, and cook rice before waking people up. He would tell people in the tone of an elder to drink a bowl of boiled water first before allowing them to eat—this way, they wouldn't be thirsty for half a day of walking and climbing... From then on, Old Liu Tou became the vanguard of the march into the forest.
    The forest survey team was in the old forest all the time, and transportation was inconvenient. They relied entirely on workers carrying grain to the work groups. Sometimes a porter would eat one-third of a bag of flour on the road. If they encountered a flood, the team members would go hungry. In order to ensure that the team members could complete their tasks well, the brigade leaders decided to transport the materials up the mountain before the main force of the brigade went up. That year, the forest survey team's survey task was the Greater Khingan Mountains. The Greater Khingan Mountains had many meadows and three seasons of floods (peach blossom floods, plum rains, and autumn floods). The slopes were gentle, and there were many rivers. When a mountain torrent came, it would be a vast expanse of water. Therefore, it was decided to use ice and snow for winter transport. Before the winter transport, people had to be sent out for "reconnaissance"—to understand the winter transport routes, the locations for setting up warehouses, the customs of the local ethnic minorities, whether there were any infectious diseases, and the changes in temperature... This time, the task of reconnaissance fell on Old Liu Tou's shoulders again.
    The ethnic minorities had a customary road to take. If the winter transport followed this road, it would have to go dozens of miles out of the way. When Old Liu Tou saw this sketch, he suggested to the brigade leaders to take a shortcut by clearing the wilderness. The leaders were worried that doing so would be uncertain, because clearing the wilderness would lead to getting lost, starving to death in the forest, and encountering wild animals... Old Liu Tou said that he was more confident in the old forest than walking on a main road, and he requested to take a few workers out to scout this shortcut.
    The temperature in the Greater Khingan Mountains in winter had already dropped below the lowest temperature mark on the thermometer. They felt their way through hundreds of miles of uninhabited old forest. At night, they camped and roasted fire. The flames were blue, and a foot away from the fire, everything was ice and snow. Under the fire was hard ice. Every day, their clothes were ice-wet. After walking for a day, the workers couldn't wait to fall asleep, but Old Liu Tou wouldn't let them sleep. He told everyone to take off their clothes and roast them, and people rubbed back to back around the fire, telling jokes. While they were "reconnoitering," they cut out a road and cut and placed fodder for the livestock, waiting for the winter transport trucks, sleds, and "grass hoppers" (large wheeled carts in Inner Mongolia) to follow one after another... This successful "reconnaissance" of clearing the wilderness and taking a shortcut saved the country a lot of money.
    After the winter transport was completed and the warehouses were set up, before the main force of the brigade went up the mountain, Old Liu Tou thought that in the Greater Khingan Mountains, the ethnic minorities would not grow vegetables, nor could they buy green vegetables. If the team members didn't eat vegetables for six months, they would get night blindness. So he quietly asked the communicator to bring vegetable seeds from the mountain and cleared wasteland to grow vegetables in the Greater Khingan Mountains. People kindly dissuaded him, saying that if vegetables could grow in the Greater Khingan Mountains, then the Greater Khingan Mountains would be in Jiangnan instead of Heilongjiang! He ignored them and continued to do it. In July and August, the vegetables grown by Old Liu Tou grew out. People found that eating small melons and vegetables was more precious than eating delicacies.
    After listening to the comrade from the transit station's introduction to Old Liu Tou, I seemed to see Old Liu Tou carrying a down quilt, roe deer skin, light iron washbasin, tools, etc., in the ice and snow, leaping nimbly over fallen trees, over blocking shrubs, and over meadows that sank with every step... I longed to talk to him and hoped to go to the Greater Khingan Mountains with him, but I couldn't find him. It wasn't until late at night, when the strong wind woke me from my dream, that I heard Old Liu Tou's voice in the outer room. When I got up the next day, just as dawn was breaking, and looked into the outer room, Old Liu Tou's bed was empty again.
    The wind was still so strong, and the daytime was still smoky and gray. Transportation to the Greater Khingan Mountains was still blocked, and the fire had not yet been extinguished. I thought that the fire fighting team was crossing the river and that there might be something I could do by the river, so I ran towards the river. When I was five meters away from the river, I saw many people going in and out of a small house, busy with something. I walked to the door, only to see smoke billowing inside (during the fire prevention period, only houses that burn coal are allowed to light a fire). Many people were crowded inside, some kneading dough and some making sesame cakes. That was the dry food supply for the fire fighting team. I immediately asked them to allow me to lend a hand. Suddenly, I turned around and saw Old Liu Tou shirtless, sweating profusely, kneading dough in front of the chopping board, holding a short rolling pin in his right hand, knocking the chopping board loudly. I saw his red face, red veins covering his shining eyes. The way he looked like the master of the house no matter where he went made me think of the "Shandong Brother" flower (city people call it the Turk's cap lily) that bloomed all over the mountains and fields of Heilongjiang. The color of this flower is fiery red, and the flower grows on top of a straight and upright green branch. Isn't the fiery red color and the straight and upright stem of this flower just like Old Liu Tou, who is in his fifties and loves life and creates life, whom I see before me?

    森林里的尖兵
    本报特约记者　逯斐
    我一到嫩江县，各家各户的门窗上都插着三角小红旗，防火了！这像一道庄严的命令，家家烟囱里顿时不再冒烟。狂风呼呼，刮得满街灰雾雾的，使人气也透不过来。正在我惴惴不安的时候，森林经理调查队转运站的负责同志来招呼我，并向我介绍一位老人——这人头发已半白了，背勾着，走路很慢，右腰挂着蒙古刀的刀鞘，刀鞘一晃一晃，看上去，这人至少有五十多岁了。但是他那双发光的眼睛，红扑扑的脸，实在和他的年岁太不相称了。转运站的同志告诉我，这是大队部派来同我一起上山的人，叫老刘头，队员们都叫他老刘大爷。我觉得很奇怪，原听说调查队员全是生龙活虎的小伙子，都要能抗热、抗湿、抗冷的，自封为“不锈钢”铸的人，怎末要这末个老人呢？跟我上山也未必有用吧？
    清早，我精神抖擞地准备出发，老刘头突然跑进门来，没头没脑地说：“发生火情，还不叫我去救火！”我没听明白他的意思，匆匆走出门去看，只见街上冷清清的，剩下些老弱在做买卖。老刘头在我背后说：“人，马，车，半夜里全出发了，防火司令部的人就不答应我去，说我年纪太大。”我转过身来安慰他：“你这大年纪，去救火是不太方便！”老刘头哼了一下，扭过身，走出门去了。站在我旁边的转运站的同志，轻轻拉一下我的衣襟，悄悄说：“老刘大爷心高，听不得这话，别瞧他平地上走路摆呀摆的，爬山过岭哪，三个小伙子也赶不上他，他过去是老林里的‘黑人’，现在可是咱队上的尖兵。这几年，他在队上还创造了不少模范事迹呢！”
    一整天，我再没见到老刘头，而且交通断绝了，一时走不了。晚上，转运站的同志来和我闲扯，慢慢谈到老刘头的事迹——
    老刘头是山东人，被伪政权骗到东北来做苦力的。他一到东北，就痴心梦想能多挣几个钱回老家去。但是没有多余的钱，连活命还难呢！最后敌人又要抓他当兵，老刘头就两手空空跑到老林里去，没想到到了老林里，就变成了“黑人”，没有户口，没有“劳工票”，就再也出不了林子了。在林子里，他住在自己搭的木房里，房子半截埋在土里，房顶依着山坡斜下来，顶上铺上土，长满草，远看像是一个小山坡。这和当年抗日联军的密营一样。他碰到过山洪泻下来、大风拔倒大树、山火凶猛蔓延，但是他全逃出了危险。他要活着，等待有一天，他能到太阳光下的城市或农村去，他要痛痛快快地生活。
    他在老林里，春天带一条狗出门，去挖贝母，夏天挖人参，秋天采蘑菇、黑菜。冬天，他就把三条狗都带出去套野牲口。漫天大雪时，他会跟着野猪群的脚印，设下套去套“猪倌”（老虎），早雾蒙蒙里，他会在河边捉到洗澡的黑熊……。他从这个山林转到那个山林。一年兴许下山一次，把皮货拿去脱手，因为他是“黑人”，只能把货托人去卖，几个转手，卖到的钱光够买点粮食和盐上山。好在在老林里，他常年把“火种”埋着，用不到火柴。一年到头油腥不缺。衣服破了就用狍皮补，用麻绳缝……
    解放后，他从老林里搬出来，户口簿上有他的名字了，但是他在村里住不惯，他嫌村子里闷，杂乱，他会在大街上迷失方向。这时他又梦见老林里的野果、野草……。1951年森林经理调查队找临时工，一下子把他找来了，他一到老林里，人变得年轻，劲头也上来了。他在队上当更夫，从这个帐篷转到那个帐篷，烧火，添柴。白天，队员们出发了，他把队员们的被子抱出来晒，把鞋子洗刷干净，破了的就给补好。队员们这个闹肚子，那个头痛了，他就用鹿骨筷子挑药膏给他们吃，他教会人们在老林里怎末生活，怎末避免生病，看到野牲口应该怎样对付……他像一本百科全书，谁有疑难都要问问他，他慢慢变成了大家的老刘大爷了。
    老刘头变成长年工以后，队上有什么难办的事，常常托给他去做。他一字不识，但能拿了一张草图，带人们去老林里，拉调查的分界线，能计算出要走多少天，应该带多少粮食。出发以后，到该歇夜打小宿的地点，他能去找水源，能在水淋淋的老林点火，防火。晚上他让旁人休息，自己靠着树根守着火堆，不使火熄灭。天不亮，他把火添旺，烧好开水煮好饭，才把人叫醒，用老长辈的口气叫人先喝一碗开水，才许吃饭——这样走路爬山半天可以不渴。……从此，老刘头就当了向森林进军的尖兵。
    森林调查队成天在老林里，交通不便，全靠工人背粮食送到工组去，有时一个背工背一袋面，在路上就要吃掉三分之一。要碰到洪水呢，队员们就得挨饿。大队领导人员为了保证队员们很好完成任务，决定在大队人马没上山前，就把物资运上山。这年森林调查队的调查任务是大兴安岭。大兴安岭的草甸子多，有三季洪水（桃花水、梅雨、秋洪），山坡缓、河道多，山洪一来就是汪洋一片，因此决定利用冰雪来冬运。冬运前先要派人出去“踏查”——了解冬运的线路、设库的地点、当地的少数民族的风俗习惯、有无传染病、气温的变化……。这次踏查的任务又落到老刘头的肩上了。
    少数民族有一条习惯走的路，如果冬运沿这条道走，必须绕远好几十里地。老刘头看到这草图，就建议大队领导上拉荒走直道，领导上担心这样做没有把握，因为拉荒，会迷失方向，会饿死在林子里，会遇到野兽……。老刘头说他在老林里，比走大马路还有把握，请求带几个工人出去踏查这条直道。
    大兴安岭冬天的气温，已经下降到气温表上最低温度的标志以下了，他们在几百里路没有人迹的老林里摸，晚上打小宿烤火，火苗是蓝的，离火堆一寸远全是冰雪，火堆下是坚硬的冰，每天全身的衣服是冰湿的，工人们走了一天，恨不得倒下就睡，但老刘头不许他们睡下，叫大家把衣服脱下烤，人背靠背围着火堆磨擦，说笑话。他们一边“踏查”，一边砍出一条道来，并把喂牲口的草料割下放好，等着冬运的大车、爬犁、草上飞（内蒙古的大轱辘车）源源不绝地跟上去。……这次拉荒走直道“踏查”成功了，替国家节省了大量的经费。
    冬运完了，库也设好了，大队还没上山，老刘头想到若在大兴安岭里，少数民族不会种菜，也买不到青菜，队员们六个月吃不到蔬菜，会得夜盲症的。他就悄悄托通讯员在山下捎上菜籽，自己在大兴安岭上开荒种菜。人们善意地劝阻他，说大兴安岭上能长出菜来，大兴安岭就不在黑龙江而在江南了！他不理会，还是照样干，到七、八月，老刘头种的菜长出来了，人们吃到瘦小的瓜菜，比吃到山珍海味还珍贵。
    我听完转运站同志对老刘头的介绍后，似乎看到在冰天雪地里，老刘头背着鸭绒被，狍皮，轻铁脸盆，工具等，健步如飞地跳过横倒木、跳过拦人的灌木林，跳过一步一陷的草甸子……。我渴望着同他谈谈，并且希望能和他一同上大兴安岭去，但是怎末也找不到他。直到深夜，狂风把我从梦中惊醒，才听到外屋老刘头的说话声。第二天天才打明，我起来到外屋一看，老刘头的炕又空着。
    风仍然那末大，白天还是烟雾雾的灰暗。去大兴安岭的交通仍阻隔着，火还没有扑灭。我想着救火队伍正在渡江，可能在江边有我能做的事，就向江边奔去。当我到离江还有五公尺远的时候，看见好多人在一间小屋里出进，不知在忙什么。我走到门边，只见门里烟雾腾腾（防火期只有烧煤的房子，才能举火）。许多人挤在里面，有的在和面，有的在打烧饼，那是供应救火队的干粮。我立即请求他们答允我去出把力。猛一回头，见老刘头赤着膊，汗流浃背地在案板前赶面，右手拿着一根短面杖，敲的案板直响，我看到他通红的脸，红丝网住了他发光的眼睛，那种到哪儿都是主人的样子，使我想到开遍在黑龙江山野上的“山东哥”花（城市人称它山丹花）。这花的颜色是火红的，花朵生长在一根笔直挺拔的绿枝顶上。这花的那种火红热辣的颜色，挺拔笔直的身干，不正像我面前的这个五十来岁才有国有家、热爱生活、创造生活的老刘头么？
