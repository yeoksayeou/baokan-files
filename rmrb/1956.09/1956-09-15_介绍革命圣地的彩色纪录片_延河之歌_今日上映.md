    “延河之歌”今日上映
    据新华社讯介绍革命圣地延安的彩色纪录片“延河之歌”定15日首先在北京上演。
    影片开头是陕北黄土高原起伏的群山，延河的流水，接着，人们看到了八路军总司令部驻址王家坪、举行过中国共产党第七次全国代表大会的杨家岭中央大礼堂、中国共产党领导人毛泽东、刘少奇、周恩来、朱德等同志工作和居住过的枣园的窑洞。影片上出现了毛泽东同志当年在灯下工作的情景。毛泽东同志在他的窑洞前面栽下的丁香树，现在已经长大了。
    在影片上还可以看到中共中央党校、中国人民抗日军政大学、鲁迅艺术学院的旧址。就是在这些地方，成千上万的革命干部受到了党的教育。
    这部影片色彩鲜明，影片导演吴本立曾前往延安领导摄制工作。
