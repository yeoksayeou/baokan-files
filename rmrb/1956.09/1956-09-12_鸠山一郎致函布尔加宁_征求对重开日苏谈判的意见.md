Xinhua News Agency, 11th - According to Kyodo News Agency, the Japanese government telegraphed today to the Japanese Foreign Ministry Councilor Kaneseki Kinzai in Moscow, instructing him to deliver a letter from Prime Minister Ichiro Hatoyama to Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Bulganin to the Soviet government within a day or two. In this letter, Hatoyama seeks the Soviet government's opinion on his visit to the Soviet Union and the resumption of Japan-Soviet negotiations.

Kyodo News Agency said that Hatoyama will explain in the letter that, during his visit to the Soviet Union, Japan intends to end the state of war between Japan and the Soviet Union by announcing the end of the state of war, exchange ambassadors between the two countries, and restore diplomatic relations. At the same time, Japan hopes that the repatriation of Japanese detained in the Soviet Union will be realized, and hopes that the Soviet Union will support Japan's accession to the United Nations. In addition, the Japanese government is convinced that the restoration of diplomatic relations between the two countries will bring into effect the Japan-Soviet Fisheries Treaty and the Maritime Rescue Agreement.

Hatoyama stated in the letter that the Japanese government hopes to know the Soviet government's opinion on this plan.

    新华社11日讯　据共同社报道，日本政府今天打电报给在莫斯科的日本外务省参事官新关钦哉，要他在一两天内把首相鸠山一郎写给苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁的一封信交给苏联政府。鸠山在这封信中征求苏联政府对他访问苏联和恢复日苏谈判的意见。
    共同社说，鸠山在信中将说明，在他访问苏联的时候，日本想用宣布结束战争状态的方法结束日苏之间的战争状态，两国互派大使，恢复外交关系。同时，日本希望遣返被拘留在苏联的日本人一事获得实现，并且希望苏联支持日本加入联合国。此外，日本政府确信，两国外交关系的恢复，将使日苏渔业条约和海上营救协定生效。
    鸠山在信中表示，日本政府希望知道苏联政府对这种方案的意见。
