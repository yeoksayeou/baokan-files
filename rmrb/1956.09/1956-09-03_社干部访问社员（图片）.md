    Cadre Visits to Commune Members
    Leading cadres of the Shuangxi Agricultural Cooperative in Shihu Township, Nanchang County, Jiangxi Province, have established a system of regularly visiting the homes of cooperative members to solicit their opinions on running the cooperative and to understand their lives.
    Top Photo: Zhang Youxiang, a member of the Shuangxi Agricultural Cooperative, has a large family and few laborers, making life relatively difficult. After learning about this situation, the cooperative's leading cadres took the initiative to help her purchase a piglet to increase her family's sideline income.
