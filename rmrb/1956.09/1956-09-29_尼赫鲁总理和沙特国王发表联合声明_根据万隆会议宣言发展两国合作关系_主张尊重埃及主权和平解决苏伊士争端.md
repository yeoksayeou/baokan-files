Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, September 28th: Indian Prime Minister Nehru and Saudi Arabian King Saud today issued a joint statement expressing the deep concern of both countries for a peaceful resolution of the Suez Canal issue.

Prime Minister Nehru and King Saud issued the joint statement after holding three days of talks in Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia. The statement was released simultaneously in Riyadh and New Delhi.

The statement said: King Saud and Prime Minister Nehru considered the recent developments in the international situation and also considered the issue of further developing friendly relations between the two countries. The King and the Prime Minister declared their adherence to the declaration issued by the Bandung Conference, which stipulates the principles upon which international relations should be based. They are determined to develop cooperation in all aspects between the two countries based on these principles.

The statement said: "Saudi Arabia and India are both deeply concerned about the peaceful resolution of the Suez Canal issue, because the Suez Canal is a waterway of great importance to their own economic welfare and the economic welfare of many other countries in the world. The dispute cannot be resolved by war or by denying Egypt's sovereignty over the Suez Canal. The right of all countries to freely pass through the canal after paying reasonable tolls has been recognized."

The statement said: "Despite the difficulties and tensions arising from this issue, a solution can still be found through consultation between the parties concerned, without diminishing Egypt's sovereignty and authority, and while maintaining the interests of other countries in unrestricted use of the canal as an open waterway." The statement expressed the hope that political and economic pressure would not be resorted to in dealing with this issue, as such pressure, in addition to other adverse consequences, would only hinder a peaceful resolution.

The statement concluded by reaffirming their determination to cooperate for the common benefit of both countries and for the sake of world peace, progress, and freedom.

    尼赫鲁总理和沙特国王发表联合声明
    根据万隆会议宣言发展两国合作关系
    主张尊重埃及主权和平解决苏伊士争端
    新华社新德里28日电　印度总理尼赫鲁和沙特阿拉伯国王沙特今天发表一项联合声明，表示两国都深切关怀苏伊士运河的和平解决。
    尼赫鲁总理同沙特国王在沙特阿拉伯首都利雅得举行了三天会谈之后发表了这项联合声明。这个声明同时在利雅得和新德里公布。
    声明说：沙特国王和尼赫鲁总理考虑了国际局势中的最近动态，并且也考虑了进一步发展两国间的友好关系问题。国王和总理宣布信守万隆会议所发表的宣言。这个宣言规定了国际关系所应依据的原则。他们决心根据这些原则在两国之间各个方面发展合作。
    声明说：“沙特阿拉伯和印度都深切关怀苏伊士运河问题争端的和平解决。因为苏伊士运河是一条对它们自己的经济福利和世界许多其他国家的经济福利都非常重要的水道。靠战争方法或者否认埃及对苏伊士运河的主权是解决不了争端的。一切国家在交付合理的通行费以后可以自由通过运河的权利已经得到承认。”
    声明说：“尽管由于这个问题而产生种种困难和紧张局势，仍然可以经过有关方面协商求得一个解决办法，而又不减损埃及主权和权威，并且又维持其他国家不受限制地使用运河作为一条畅通的水道的利益。”声明表示希望在处理这个问题时不会诉诸政治和经济压力。因为这种压力除了会有其他不好后果以外，只会妨碍和平解决。
    声明最后重申他们决心为了两国共同利益和世界和平，进步和自由的利益而共同合作。
