Xinhua News Agency, September 7th, Dispatch from London: The British Cabinet convened on September 6th and decided to convene Parliament on September 12th, earlier than the originally scheduled resumption on October 23rd. According to a report by United Press International, the only major issue to be discussed by Parliament is: if the Suez Canal issue is not resolved, how to use the British and French expeditionary forces assembled in the Eastern Mediterranean.

The Labour Party's "shadow cabinet," which had long called for the reconvening of Parliament, also held a meeting on the same day. They demanded a "very full" debate in Parliament on the Suez Canal issue. It is said that they may also request a debate on the Cyprus issue.

Xinhua News Agency, September 7th, Dispatch from Paris: French Prime Minister Mollet convened a cabinet meeting on September 6th to discuss the Suez Canal issue. At the meeting, Foreign Minister Pineau reported on the progress of the talks between the "Five-Nation Committee" delegation and Egyptian President Nasser, as well as his meeting with British Foreign Secretary Lloyd on the 5th. He also reported to the meeting on the special meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council held on the 5th regarding the Suez Canal issue.

According to a United Press International report, this cabinet meeting discussed the following three main issues:

	1. The specific details of the actions France would take if Egypt refused to accept Dulles' Suez Canal plan.
	2. How to utilize the issue of Israel. Ministers studied the issue of requesting Israel to allow the stationing of troops there, and also studied the possibility of enlisting Israel's help in future actions against Egypt.
	3. The issue of the concentration of British and French troops, "especially in Cyprus."

    英国决定提早召开议会　法国内阁举行会议
    企图找出对付埃及的新办法
    据新华社7日讯　伦敦消息：英国内阁在9月6日召开会议，决定召集原定在10月23日才复会的议会提早在9月12日复会。据合众社报道，议会要讨论的唯一重大问题是：如果苏彝士运河问题得不到解决，将如何使用集结在东地中海的英法远征部队。
    早就提出了要议会复会的工党“在野内阁”也在同一天举行了会议。他们要求议会就苏彝士运河问题进行“非常充分”的辩论。据说，他们还可能要求辩论塞浦路斯问题。
    据新华社7日讯　巴黎消息：法国总理摩勒9月6日召开内阁会议，讨论苏彝士运河问题。会上，外交部长比诺报告“五国委员会”代表团和埃及总统纳赛尔举行会谈的进展情况以及他在5日同英国外交大臣劳埃德会谈的情况。他还向会议报告了5日北大西洋公约集团理事会就苏彝士运河问题举行特别会谈的情况。
    据合众社消息说，这次内阁会议讨论了下面三个主要问题：
    一、假如埃及拒绝接受杜勒斯的苏彝士运河计划，法国将采取的行动的具体细节。
    二、如何利用以色列的问题。部长们研究了要求以色列允许在那里驻扎军队的问题，也研究了在对付埃及未来行动中争取以色列帮助的可能性问题。
    三、英法军队集结，“特别是在塞浦路斯”进行这种集结的问题。
