Xinhua News Agency, New York, 13th. The Egyptian delegation to the United Nations circulated a communiqué at the United Nations on the 12th, condemning British and French military threats against Egypt. This communiqué is a response to the communiqué issued by the British and French leaders after their meeting in London on the 11th.

The communiqué stated that the proposals made by the "Five-Nation Committee" in Cairo last week do not conform to the United Nations Charter and the conventions of international morality.

The communiqué stated that the committee demanded that Egypt abandon its sovereignty and its legitimate rights to the Suez Canal, which is an inseparable part of Egypt.

The communiqué stated that, while making this demand, it also threatened the use of force. This means that the purpose is to threaten Egypt and force it to accept a system without free negotiations.

The communiqué stated that the threats made by Britain and France and their attempts to seize the canal are a direct violation of international law and justice.

Referring to the decision of the former Suez Canal Company to instruct its non-Egyptian staff to leave their posts on the weekend, the communiqué said: "This fact shows that this is a plan to disrupt shipping and create events that will make it possible for them to intervene."

    埃及驻联合国代表团发表公报
    谴责英法对埃进行武力威胁
    据新华社13日讯　纽约联合国消息：埃及驻联合国代表团十二日在联合国散发了一份公报，谴责英法对埃及进行武力威胁。这份公报是对十一日英法首脑在伦敦会谈后发表的公报的一个回答。
    这个公报说，上周“五国委员会”在开罗提出的建议不符合联合国宪章和国际道义的惯例。
    公报说，这个委员会要求埃及放弃它的主权和它对苏彝士运河的合法权利，而运河是埃及的不可分割的部分。
    公报说，在提出这个要求的同时还扬言要使用武力。这意味着目的是威胁埃及，强使它接受一种制度，而不经过自由谈判。
    公报说，英国和法国进行的威胁和他们企图强占运河的做法是直接违反国际法和正义的。
    公报在谈到前苏彝士运河公司指使它的非埃及工作人员在周末离职的决定时说：“这一事实就表明这是一个企图破坏航运和制造使他们有可能进行干涉的事件的计划。”
