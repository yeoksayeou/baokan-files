Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 8th. The survey and development planning of water resources in the subtropical region of Guangdong Province have achieved preliminary results. According to materials obtained from recent surveys, the development of just seven major rivers in Hainan Island and the Zhanjiang and Hepu Special Zones can irrigate more than 16.7 million mu of newly reclaimed tropical and subtropical economic crops and farmland.

The water resources survey team organized by the Guangdong Subtropical Resources Development Committee began survey activities in Hainan Island and the Zhanjiang and Hepu Special Zones at the end of last year. Cai Banglin, a water conservancy expert and deputy director of the Survey and Design Bureau of the Ministry of Water Conservancy, who led the work, told Xinhua reporters that the main achievement of this survey work was to understand the rich water resources of these areas and to formulate a development plan for water storage and irrigation, thus solving the drought problem that people in this area previously considered difficult to overcome. These water conservancy development plans will be carried out in line with the subtropical resources development work in these areas.

After comprehensive and in-depth survey work, the Guangdong Subtropical Resources Development Committee has determined a policy of focusing on water storage and comprehensive utilization, and plans to build dozens of large and medium-sized reservoirs on the seven major rivers in these areas to store water and control water flow, while also using these reservoirs to generate electricity and improve navigation conditions.

    广东亚热带地区水利资源勘察获得成果
    仅七条大河流开发后即可浇地一千多万亩
    新华社广州8日电　广东省亚热带地区的水利资源的勘察和开发规划工作已获得初步成果。据最近经过勘察后得到的材料确定，仅海南岛和湛江、合浦专区的七条大河流开发后，便可灌溉新开垦的一千六百七十多万亩热带、亚热带经济作物和农田。
    由广东省亚热带资源开发委员会组织的水利勘察队伍，去年底就在海南岛和湛江、合浦专区先后开始了勘察活动。领导这一工作的水利专家、水利部勘测设计局副局长蔡邦霖对新华社记者说，这次勘察工作的主要成就，是摸清了这些地区的丰富水利资源，订出蓄水灌溉的开发方案，因而将解决这一带过去人们认为难以克服的干旱问题。这些水利开发规划将和这些地区亚热带资源开发工作相适应进行。
    广东省亚热带资源开发委员会经过全面深入的勘察工作后，确定以蓄水为主和综合利用的方针，计划在这些地区的七条大河流建立几十个大、中型水库蓄水和控制水流，同时利用这些水库发电，并且改善航运情况。
