Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 7th - The Guangxi Provincial Party Committee convened a province-wide rural sideline production work conference from August 30th to September 4th. The central issue discussed was how to further develop rural sideline production and strive to increase the income of more than 90% of cooperative members.

Guangxi Province's unit area yield of summer grain crops this year increased by about 10% compared to last year. However, the sideline income of farmers across the province in the first half of the year decreased by about 35% compared to the same period last year. As a result, in the summer harvest pre-distribution, the total agricultural and sideline income of about 20% of agricultural cooperatives decreased compared to last year, and among the cooperatives with increased production, about 35% of the members did not increase or saw a decrease in their income.

Currently, the harvesting of mid-season rice has begun throughout the province, and late-season rice and late-season corn crops are generally growing well. If no special natural disasters occur in the future, grain production can still be increased. However, grain accounts for less than half of farmers' total annual income. Whether 90% of cooperative members can increase their income this year depends critically on doing a good job in sideline production in the second half of the year.

Since May, the collective sidelines of agricultural cooperatives have seen significant development, but a considerable number of agricultural cooperatives have neglected the leadership of cooperative members' household sideline production. The conference believed that the current task should be to vigorously develop sideline production while continuing to do a good job in increasing grain production. Currently, particular attention should be paid to restoring and developing cooperative members' household sidelines.

The conference discussed some of the main problems currently hindering the development of cooperative members' household sideline production. Some rural cadres one-sidedly emphasize the collective interests of agricultural cooperatives and have incorrect understandings about developing cooperative members' household sidelines. Therefore, the cooperatives take on everything. Some agricultural cooperatives not only do not support cooperative members' household sidelines but also restrict, interfere with, and even suppress them. It was unanimously agreed that these erroneous ideas and behaviors must be thoroughly criticized and corrected. The representatives also cited many examples of cooperative members doing well in household sideline production, illustrating that as long as the cooperatives conduct comprehensive planning and coordinate arrangements, allowing cooperative members to engage in household sidelines will not affect the cooperatives' production.

The conference believed that strengthening leadership and multi-faceted support and assistance is urgently needed for the development of household sideline production. Problems such as the lack of funds, breeding livestock, young poultry, feed, raw materials, and sales, although they should be mainly solved by self-reliance, still present many difficulties. For example, when the cooperatives arrange production, they do not give cooperative members appropriate time to engage in household sideline production, cooperative members' private plots are not sufficient for growing feed crops, and the purchase prices of sideline products in many areas are not reasonable. These problems urgently need to be solved with the help of cooperative leaders and financial and economic enterprises.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 7th - Agricultural production cooperatives in the disaster areas of Henan Province are extensively carrying out sideline production activities. In the areas of Xinxiang and Shangqiu Special Zones, and eight counties including Tangyin, Shangcai, and Weishi, which were affected by floods, more than 290,000 laborers are currently engaged in sideline production. In the disaster area of Huixian County, 191 agricultural cooperatives have already profited more than 143,000 yuan from sideline production in early and mid-August. Xixian County, which has suffered continuous floods this year, has solved the livelihood difficulties of 200,000 people before the autumn harvest by adopting the method of "multiple avenues and multiple paths" to develop sideline production.

The sidelines operated by farmers in the disaster areas generally include 20 to 30 types such as the timber industry, transportation, processing, weaving, and fishing. When organizing cooperative members to engage in these sideline activities with small investments, quick returns, and large profits, agricultural cooperatives in various places have clearly divided the business scope of the cooperative and the cooperative members' household sidelines according to different conditions, and have formulated reasonable distribution methods. The Lanhe Township Agricultural Cooperative in Yancheng County stipulates that, except for larger handicrafts such as the timber industry, weaving mats, and making writing brushes, which are operated uniformly by the cooperative, transportation, mud work, stone work, and milling are operated by the production team, and sidelines such as weaving straw hat braids, spinning, weaving, and fishing are operated by cooperative members' families. From mid-July to the end of August, the Fourth Agricultural Cooperative of Wangcun Township in Yuanyang County made a profit of 2,300 yuan from collective sideline operations by 250 members, and the members themselves made a profit of 1,400 yuan from sideline operations such as boiling salt, carrying loads, and doing odd jobs. The Honghe Agricultural Cooperative in Xiping County recently distributed 78% of its sideline income from the previous period to the members according to the principle of more work, more pay, and appropriately taking care of households in difficulty. In addition to purchasing necessities, the disaster-stricken members also bought 148 more chickens and ducks, expanding their household sidelines.

### 集体副业和家庭副业不能偏废  广西农村副业生产会议要求农业社全面规划统筹安排  河南灾区农业社划分经营范围并制定合理的分配办法

    集体副业和家庭副业不能偏废
    广西农村副业生产会议要求农业社全面规划统筹安排
    河南灾区农业社划分经营范围并制定合理的分配办法
    新华社南宁7日电　8月30日到9月4日中共广西省委召开的全省农村副业生产工作会议，讨论的中心问题是如何进一步开展农村副业生产，争取90％以上的社员增加收入。
    广西省今年夏收的粮食作物单位面积产量比去年增加一成左右；但上半年全省农民的副业收入，都比去年同期减少35％左右，因此在夏收预分中，有20％左右的农业社农副业总收入比去年减少，增产社中也有35％左右的社员没有增加或减少了收入。
    目前，全省中稻已开始收割，晚稻、晚玉米作物普遍生长良好，今后如无特殊的自然灾害发生，粮食仍可获得增产。但粮食占农民全年总收入的比重，还不到一半。今年能否达到90％的社员增加收入，决定关键在于搞好下半年的副业生产。
    5月以后，各农业社的集体副业有了显著的发展，但是有相当数量的农业社忽视了对社员家庭副业生产的领导。会议认为当前任务应当是在继续搞好粮食增产的同时，大力开展副业生产，在目前特别应当抓紧恢复和发展社员家庭副业。
    会议讨论了当前阻碍社员家庭副业发展的一些主要问题。有些农村干部片面地强调农业社的集体利益，而对发展社员家庭副业存在着不正确的认识，因此，社里包揽一切，某些农业社对社员家庭副业不但不予以支持，反而进行限制、干涉、甚至打击。一致认为这些错误的思想和行为，必须彻底进行批判、纠正。代表们还举出许多社员家庭副业搞得好的实例，说明只要社里进行全面规划，统筹安排，让社员从事家庭副业，并不会影响社的生产的。
    会议认为发展家庭副业生产迫切需要加强领导和多方面的支援和帮助。如在资金、种畜、幼禽、饲料、原料、销售等方面存在的问题，虽然应以自己解决为主，但是还存在许多困难。如社里安排生产时没有给予社员从事家庭副业生产适当的时间，社员自留地不足以种植饲料作物，许多地区副业产品收购价格不够合理，这些问题都亟待社的领导和财经企业部门帮助解决。
    新华社郑州7日电　河南省灾区的农业生产合作社正在广泛开展副业生产活动。新乡、商丘专区和汤阴、上蔡、尉氏等八个县遭受水灾的地区，目前从事副业生产的劳动力已达二十九万多人。辉县灾区的一百九十一个农业社，在8月上、中旬，已从副业生产中获利十四万三千多元。今年连续遭受水灾的息县，农民们采取“多头多路”的办法开展副业生产后，解决了二十万人在秋收前的生活困难。
    灾区农民经营的副业，大体有木业、运输、加工、编织、捕鱼等二、三十种。各地农业社在组织社员从事这些投资小、收益快、收益大的副业活动时，为了作到人尽其才，大都根据不同的条件明确地划分了社与社员家庭副业的经营范围，并且制定了合理的分配办法。郾城县拦河乡农业社规定，除木业、编席和做毛笔等较大的手工业由社统一经营外，运输、泥工、石工、磨粉等归生产队经营，编草帽辫、纺织、捕鱼等副业由社员家庭经营。原阳县王村乡第四农业社自7月中旬至8月底，社内二百五十人集体经营的副业，已经获利二千三百元，社员自己经营的熬盐、担挑、做工等副业，也获利一千四百元，西平县洪河农业社最近把前一段的副业收入，抽出78％按照多劳多得和适当照顾困难户的原则分给社员后，受灾的社员们除购买了生活必需品外，还添买鸡、鸭一百四十八只，扩大了家庭副业。
