Shanxi Xin County Special District Jin Opera Troupe Performs Northern Lu Bangzi in Beijing

    (Our newspaper's dispatch) The People's Jin Opera Second Troupe of Xin County Special District, Shanxi Province, began performing Northern Lu Bangzi in Beijing yesterday. Northern Lu Bangzi is popular in northern Shanxi, as well as in Datong, Baotou, Hohhot, and other regions, and is deeply loved by the local people. However, during the War of Resistance Against Japan, it suffered devastation and destruction by the enemy. Many troupes disbanded, many artists changed careers, and it was interrupted for as long as eighteen years.

    After liberation, this opera genre once again shone with brilliance. During the first Shanxi Province Opera Observation and Performance Conference in 1955, the cultural departments of the province and the special district organized famous artists Jia Guilin (stage name Xiao Diandeng) and veteran artist Gao Yugui (stage name Jiu Suihong) to participate in the performance. After the conference, the Northern Lu Bangzi professional troupe – the People's Jin Opera Second Troupe of Xin County Special District – was formally established in February 1955.

    In just a year and a half, the troupe has already unearthed and staged more than 150 plays. The plays they are preparing to perform in Beijing this time include: "Calculating Grain," "Crying at the Palace," "Visiting Bai Pao," "Ba Zhou," "Walking the Snow Mountain," "Tianmen Array," "Northern Tianmen," "Apricot River," and "Nine Pieces of Clothing," etc. These are all traditional plays that have been processed and refined, and they also have a unique style in the art of performance.

    山西忻县专区晋剧团在京公演北路梆子
    本报讯　山西省忻县专区人民晋剧二分团昨日开始在北京公演北路梆子。北路梆子流行于晋北以及大同、包头、呼和浩特等地区，深受当地群众的喜爱。但在抗日战争期间，受到敌人的摧残和破坏，许多剧团解散，许多艺人改行，中断达十八年之久。
    解放后，这个剧种又重新放出异彩。1955年山西省第一届戏曲观摩演出大会时，省和专区的文化部门组织了著名艺人贾桂林（艺名小电灯）和老艺人高玉贵（艺名九岁红）参加演出。会演后，于1955年2月正式成立了北路梆子职业剧团——忻县专区人民晋剧二分团。
    该团在仅仅一年半的时间当中，已经发掘出上演剧目一百五十出以上。他们这次来京准备演出的剧目有：“算粮”、“哭殿”、“访白袍”、“巴州”、“走雪山”、“天门阵”、“北天门”、“杏子河”、“九件衣”等。这些都是经过加工整理的传统剧目，在表演艺术上也具有独特的风格。（明辉）
