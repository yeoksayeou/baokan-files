Hoping to improve teaching methods in universities

    Changing the Excellent Student System
    The excellent student system in universities has created many problems in its implementation.
    First, the excellent student system encourages students to develop in an all-round way, but it also fosters a tendency for students to develop evenly, hindering young students from conducting in-depth research on their interests and hobbies and on the issues they love. There are many courses in university, and students have limited energy. It is almost impossible for the vast majority of students to have in-depth research and unique insights into every course. Therefore, on the basis of having a basic understanding of each course, it is reasonable to spend more time on courses of interest and conduct in-depth and meticulous research. It should never be said that this is a neglect of other subjects. However, it is difficult to get a score of five for every course, and excellent grades are one of the main conditions for evaluating top students. Therefore, many students use their energy evenly to strive for excellent grades in all courses. The result of this even distribution of energy is that students are limited to a superficial understanding of each course.
    Secondly, this system also encourages students to simply pursue scores, to memorize notes and textbooks by rote, forgetting that the real purpose of learning is a true understanding of the courses being studied. This has also led to excellent students feeling nervous during exams, fearing that their exam scores will drop and they will not be able to maintain their honor; and even to the phenomenon of arguing with teachers for scores. In addition, I think the re-examination system adopted for the purpose of striving for top student status (when a student has a score of five in all other courses but only a score of four in one course, the course with the score of four can be re-examined once) is also unnecessary, as it will only encourage students to simply pursue scores. (Zhang Hua)

      Cultivating Specialized Talents
    The state requires universities to cultivate specialized talents. However, the Chinese Language and Literature Department of Peking University cannot well cultivate students according to this policy. The Chinese Language and Literature Department is divided into language and literature specialties, but this division is not implemented until the fourth year. Before this, students of both specialties have to learn the prescribed courses. This not only wastes the time and energy of the students, but also indirectly affects the development of students' strengths. Therefore, I suggest that it is best to separate the specialties for study in the second year. Students studying literature may not study language courses, and students studying language can of course not study literature courses. In this way, students can spend more time and energy on their specialties and do a better job in their studies.
                      (Shi Youwei)

      Adopting Written Exams
    At present, universities generally implement an oral examination system. I have some different views on this system. I think written examinations also have their advantages, and oral examinations have many shortcomings.
    1. Oral examinations can make students nervous and excessively tired. In order to strive for a score of five, many students open night classes and desperately memorize articles by rote, resulting in damage to their health.
    2. Oral examinations cannot accurately and comprehensively evaluate a student's academic performance. Because
   there are only one or two questions on the examination slip for the oral examination, and because there are many examination slips, the questions are scattered; some are easy and some are difficult. A student may answer the questions on the examination slip accurately and get a score of five. However, this does not mean that the student has comprehensively mastered the knowledge of this course. If a student does not answer the questions well, this does not mean that his or her usual academic performance is necessarily bad. This will lead to accidental success and failure.
    Written examinations can avoid these shortcomings. Written examinations have many questions, which can more comprehensively measure a student's performance. The questions on the written examination are all the same, so there will be no accidental success or failure for anyone. (Mao Yulan)

    Reducing the Social Work of Class Leaders
    It is inappropriate to implement the "class leader responsibility system" in schools. There are thirty or forty students in a class. The two class leaders, the leader and the deputy leader, have to care about the study and life of all the students in the class, and also have to bear a lot of administrative work: such as evaluating and distributing financial aid, buying train tickets for students to go home for vacation, collecting food stamps, subscribing to public bonds, and even when students take things out of the school, the class leader has to issue a "pass." The class leader has the same course load as ordinary students, and excessive social work takes up his time, which is bound to affect his studies. I hope that the school will take effective measures to liberate student cadres from many complex affairs.

    希望改进高等学校的教学方法
    改变优秀生制度
    高等学校中的优秀生制度，在执行中产生了很多问题。
    首先，优秀生制度鼓励了学生为了全面发展，却也助长了学生平均发展的趋向，妨碍了青年学生根据自己的志趣和爱好和对自己喜爱的问题作深入的研究。大学里的课程是比较多的，而学生的精力是有限的，要想对每一门课程都有深入的研究和独到的体会，对绝大多数的学生来说，几乎是不可能的。因此，在对每一门课程都有基本的领会的基础上，对自己有兴趣的课程，花较多的时间，作深入细致的钻研，这是合情合理的，绝不能说是偏废。不过这样就很难得到每门课程都是五分的成绩，而优良成绩是评选优等生的主要条件之一。因此，不少同学平均使用力量，来争取全部课程优等。这样平均使用力量的结果，就会使得同学们对每一门课程都限于表面的肤浅的了解。
    其次，这种制度还助长了学生为了单纯追求分数，就去死啃硬记笔记课本，忘记了学习的真正目的是对所学课程的真正的理解。这样也出现了优秀生考试时心情紧张，生怕考试分数下降，不能保持荣誉；甚至发生向老师争分数的现象。此外，对于为争取优等生而采取的复试制度（一个学生其它课程全为五分而只有一门为四分时，考四分的那一门课程可以重考一次），我认为也是不必要的，这只会助长学生们单纯追求分数。　（张华）
      培养专门人材
    国家对高等学校的要求是培养专门人材。但是，北京大学中文系语言文学专业就不能很好地按这个方针培养学生。中文系的语言文学专业分语言专业和文学专业，但这种分法要到四年级才施行。在这以前，这两个专业的学生都要学所规定的各门功课。这不仅浪费了同学们的时间和精力，并且间接影响了学生特长的发挥。因此，我建议：最好能在二年级就分专业学习。学文学的可以不学语言课，学语言的当然也可以不学文学课。这样，学生就可以把更多的时间和精力用在自己的专业上，把学习搞得更好。
                      （史有为）
      采用笔试
    现在高等学校普遍实行口试制度。我对这个制度有些不同的看法。我觉得笔试也有它的好处，口试有不少缺点。
    一、口试会使学生精神紧张，过度疲劳。为了争取五分，许多学生开夜班，拼命地死背死记条文，结果把身体累坏了。
    二、口试并不能准确地、全面地评定一个学生的学习成绩。因为
  口试的考签上只有一、二个题目，又因考签很多，题目也就很零散；有的容易有的难。一个学生也许对考签上的题目回答的很准确，得了五分。但是，这不能说明这个学生已经全面掌握了这门课的知识。如果一个学生对问题回答的不好，这也不能说明他平时的学习成绩一定很坏。这就会产生偶然的成功和失败。
    采用笔试就可避免这些缺点。笔试的题目很多，可以比较全面地衡量一个学生的成绩。笔试的题目全是一样，就不会产生某人的偶然成功或失败。　（茅于兰）
    减少班长的社会工作
    在学校里实行“班长负责制”是不适当的。一个班有三四十个同学。正副班长二人，要关心全班同学的学习和生活，还要担负很多事务性的工作：如评议和发放助学金，同学放假回家买火车票，领粮票，认购公债，甚至在同学拿东西出门的时候，还要班长去打“放行证”。班长和一般同学有同样的功课负担，过多的社会工作占去了他的时间，势必影响学习。我希望学校要采取有效措施，使学生干部从许多复杂的事务中解放出来。
