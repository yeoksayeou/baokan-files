Comrades,

On behalf of the Central Committee of the Syrian-Lebanese Communist Party, and on behalf of all Communists and patriots in our country, I would like to extend to the glorious Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, and through it to all the Chinese people, our sincere, warm, and solidarity-filled congratulations, overflowing with friendship, love, and gratitude.

The Syrian-Lebanese Communist Party delegation firmly believes that its expression of fraternal friendship and gratitude to the Chinese people at this congress not only reflects the feelings of the Syrian and Lebanese people, but also reflects the belief of tens of millions of Arabs in their respective countries, based on their own personal experience, in the People's Republic of China, this great country in East Asia. They are convinced that in their struggle for liberation from imperialist rule, for national sovereignty, and for national independence, the People's Republic of China is their sincere friend and strong supporter.

Your congress is summing up the experiences you have gone through in building your motherland, and is formulating the correct path to transform your motherland into a powerful socialist industrial country. This congress is a meeting of historical significance internationally.

The Arab people, who are struggling for the independence and unification of their homeland, wholeheartedly support all the efforts of the Chinese people to liberate Taiwan from foreign occupation in order to achieve the reunification of their motherland. Tens of millions of Arabs demand in their respective countries that their great friend, the People's Republic of China, obtain its rightful seat in the United Nations. Dear comrades,

The people of Arab countries and Egypt, the largest Arab country, are now engaged in a struggle to safeguard national sovereignty, which is attracting the attention of world opinion, namely, the Suez Canal struggle, because the course of the entire international situation largely depends on the progress and outcome of this struggle, and at this stage, even the future of the cause of world peace largely depends on this struggle.

The victory of Egypt in the canal struggle is a victory for the cause of world peace, a victory for all progressive mankind who demands to be forever free from imperialist humiliation and the horrors of imperialist war.

The British and French imperialist bloc, with the support of American imperialism, is attempting to infringe upon Egypt's right to exercise sovereignty on its own territory, and is attempting to seize the Suez Canal from Egypt. The British and French imperialists have concentrated their navies in the Eastern Mediterranean, and sent troops to land in Cyprus, carrying out all kinds of threats of armed intervention and military occupation in the hope of forcing Egypt to concede. However, Egypt stands firm in the face of imperialist pressure and resolutely resists it. Egypt's firm attitude has sparked a great mass movement in the Arab world, uniting millions of people under the slogan of a national front against imperialism.

A military treaty links Syria and Egypt, and the Syrian parliament recently passed a draft law on the establishment of a federation with Egypt, which has long been at the forefront of the movement for Arab solidarity with the brotherly people of Egypt. To this end, a committee to support Egypt has been established in Damascus. Representatives from all major parties and political factions are participating: the Arab Ba'ath Socialist Party, the Nationalist Party, the People's Party, the Islamic Movement, independent democrats, and the Communist Party. This committee has issued a call to all Arab people, demanding that they hold strikes and express their solidarity with Egypt.

In response to this call, a massive mass movement based on the slogan of national unity has been launched in Lebanon. The Communist Party and other parties, as well as patriotic forces, are participating in this movement. A committee to support Egypt has also been established in Jordan, with representatives from the Socialist Party, the Patriotic Party, the Renaissance Party, the Communist Party, and non-party democrats participating.

In Iraq, despite the policy of terror pursued by the rulers of Iraq—the accomplices of the Baghdad Pact—all patriots, including the Iraqi Communist Party, have achieved joint action.

As for Egypt, national unity has in fact been fully demonstrated in the unanimous support for the patriotic and courageous policies implemented by President Gamal Abdel Nasser.

Thus, the whole world has witnessed a great mass patriotic upsurge in the Arab world. On August 14, 15, and 16, 800,000 people from Marrakesh to Baghdad participated in demonstrations and general strikes, chanting: "Imperialists, withdraw your claws from Egypt!"

To assess the great significance of this mass upsurge, it is enough to mention the mass rally held in Damascus in support of Egypt, which brought together 150,000 representatives of workers, students, women, merchants, craftsmen, individual laborers, patriotic capitalists, and peasants.

Thus, you can clearly see that Egypt and all the Arab people are equally determined to defend the canal and their right to sovereignty and national independence.

The Arab people know very well that they are not isolated in this struggle, and that the entire powerful world socialist camp stands with them. ... The people of Asian and African countries stand by them, the people of Latin American countries stand by them, and the working class and honest people of France, Britain, and European countries also stand by them.

The call issued by the great Soviet Union at the London Conference is the voice of a loyal defender of the cause of Egypt and all Arab people. The Soviet statement on the Suez Canal is a clear and resolute warning to the imperialists.

People's China, whether in its statements in the past, in Comrade Mao Zedong's speech at this congress, or in Comrade Zhou Enlai's speech at the Bandung Conference, has proven that it is a sincere friend of the Arab people, a pioneer of the national liberation movement, and a vanguard in safeguarding Asian and African peace.

Arabs of all different political views express their deepest gratitude to the Soviet Union, to People's China, to the people's democratic countries, to India, Indonesia, Ceylon, Yugoslavia, and to all countries that have supported their just struggle in the past and present.

Egypt and all the Arab people demand that all disputes concerning navigation on the Suez Canal be resolved through peaceful means, based on respect for Egypt's sovereignty over the canal.

However, if the imperialists carry out armed aggression to forcibly control the canal, then the example of Algeria will show what awaits them, not only in Egypt, but also in Syria and every Arab country. The brave Arab fighters of Algeria are valiantly fighting for national independence and national sovereignty, striking French imperialism with weapons...

The armed forces of French imperialism, despite their barbarity and cruelty, have already failed in suppressing the Algerian national uprising. Therefore, the British and French imperialists, as well as the American imperialists who support them, should understand that other Arab people are as heroic and tenacious as the Algerian people.

Moreover, these Arab countries are independent, and the power they possess is, of course, even greater and more powerful.

We, the Syrian people, affirm to the imperialists that if they dare to stain our land or the land of Egypt with imperialist filth, then, in the independent Syrian nation, the united Syrian people and the Syrian army will beat them to a pulp.

Comrades,

In every part of the Arab homeland that has been liberated from foreign occupation and has gained national independence, especially in the lands of Syria, Lebanon, and Egypt, the Arab people are willing to live peacefully in their homelands, and they are willing to take peaceful methods to advance towards the path of democracy, economic prosperity, and cultural progress.

We have all kinds of possibilities and favorable conditions for achieving this peaceful progress, but imperialism hinders this peaceful development by exerting pressure, threatening, and interfering in internal affairs.

When a number of Arab countries achieved political independence, and when foreign troops withdrew from their territories due to the struggles of the people of these countries and the new international situation, the imperialists hoped that this independence would become a mere scrap of paper, allowing them to continue to exercise their power and maintain their actual rule and their system of exploitation by covert means.

However, Egypt and Syria, which are at the forefront of the Arab world's liberation movement, have broken the chains of imperialism and have exercised their sovereign and independent rights. They are embarking on the development of industry and agriculture, for which they have begun to expand their economic and political ties with the socialist camp.

Recently, Egypt and Syria were the first two Arab countries to establish formal diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China.

Imperialism has exhausted all means to obstruct this progress in Egypt and Syria, either by directly exerting pressure, or by indirectly exerting pressure, sometimes using Turkey, and sometimes using Israel, since the imperialists have long turned this country into a military base against the Arab national liberation movement and a tool in their hands. The imperialists have adopted these measures to exert pressure in an attempt to force us to join the Baghdad Pact, and they have attempted to change the independent and free orientation chosen by these countries. However, due to the resistance of the people and the increasing friendship and cooperation between the army and the people in the anti-imperialist struggle, all of imperialism's high-handed measures have suffered a miserable defeat. Therefore, imperialism is currently trying to find a way to reoccupy our country and re-establish direct rule over our homeland, in order to hinder the Arab people from moving forward on the road of freedom, independence, and industrial, agricultural, and cultural progress.

But this is not easy... Comrades, with your support and assistance, we must defend our independence.

With your support and assistance, the Arab people must completely liberate the countries that are still occupied or bound by imperialist treaties.

We must continue to advance on the path of national liberation and economic and cultural development. We must achieve the unity of the Arab nation on the basis of democracy and complete freedom from imperialist rule.

Comrades,

As Communists of Syria and Lebanon, we have learned much from the Twentieth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the vanguard and elder brother of the world's Communist parties. The Twentieth Congress was a great historical turning point in the development of the world Communist movement. This congress has opened up broad new vistas for us Arab Communists in the struggle to achieve the liberation of our respective countries on the basis of national united fronts, and to advance towards the path of democratic development and the path of industrial, agricultural, and cultural progress in accordance with the national and historical characteristics of each country.

Today, we are again learning from your great Eighth Congress the history of your glorious struggles in the past, and how to unite all progressive forces, including the national bourgeoisie, to the greatest extent possible to implement the policy of an anti-imperialist national united front. We are loyal to our people, loyal to our homeland, and loyal to the principles of Marxism-Leninism. As the experience of great China has proven, these principles lead to the path of national liberation, the path of true democratic development, and the path of glorious advancement toward socialism that the Arab people long for.

Long live the great Communist Party of China under the leadership of its glorious Central Committee!

Long live the great socialist peace camp headed by the Soviet Union, the faithful friend and strong supporter of the Arab people! Long live the friendship between the Arab countries and China!

### 叙利亚—黎巴嫩共产党代表团团长巴格达什同志致词

专栏：

    叙利亚—黎巴嫩共产党代表团团长巴格达什同志致词同志们：
    我代表叙利亚—黎巴嫩共产党中央委员会，代表我们国家所有共产党人和爱国人士，谨向光荣的中国共产党第八次全国代表大会并且通过它向全体中国人民致以真挚的、热烈的、并洋溢着团结、友爱和感激的情绪的祝贺。
    叙利亚—黎巴嫩共产党代表团深信，它在这次大会上向中国人民表示兄弟般的友爱和感激情绪不仅反映着叙利亚和黎巴嫩人民的心情，并且也反映着几千万阿拉伯人在各自的国家内从自己切身的经验中所获得的对中华人民共和国这个东亚的伟大国家的信念，深信在他们为了从帝国主义的统治下求得解放、为争取国家主权和民族独立而进行的斗争中，中华人民共和国是他们的真诚的朋友和有力的支持者。
    你们的大会总结你们在建设祖国方面所经历过的各个阶段的经验，并且制定把你们的祖国改造成为一个强大的社会主义工业国的正确路线。这次大会是一个在国际上具有历史意义的会议。
    正在为祖国的独立和统一而斗争的阿拉伯人民衷心地支援中国人民为了从外国占领下解放台湾以实现祖国的统一而进行的一切努力。几千万阿拉伯人民在他们国内要求他们伟大的朋友中华人民共和国在联合国中取得它应有的席位。亲爱的同志们：
    现在阿拉伯各国人民和埃及这个最大的阿拉伯国家一起，进行着维护民族主权的，也就是全世界舆论所注目的苏伊士运河的斗争，因为整个国际形势的进程在很大程度上要取决于这个斗争的进程和它的结局，在现阶段，甚至世界和平事业的前途也在很大程度上取决于这个斗争。
    埃及在运河斗争上的胜利是全世界和平事业的胜利，是要求永远摆脱帝国主义的凌辱和帝国主义战争的恐怖的整个进步人类的胜利。
    英法帝国主义集团在美国帝国主义的支持下企图侵犯埃及在自己国土上行使主权的权力，并企图从埃及手中夺取苏伊士运河。英法帝国主义者将它们的海军集结在东地中海，并且派遣军队在塞浦路斯登陆，进行了种种企图武装干涉和军事占领的恫吓以期迫使埃及让步。但是，埃及在帝国主义者的压力面前屹立不动，并坚决地予以抗击。埃及的坚定态度在阿拉伯世界掀起了伟大的群众运动，这一运动把几百万人在反对帝国主义的民族阵线的口号下团结起来。
    一个军事条约把叙利亚和埃及联结在一起，叙利亚议会并在最近通过了同埃及成立联邦的草案，它早已站在阿拉伯人同埃及兄弟人民团结一致的运动的前列。为此，在大马士革已经成立了一个支援埃及的委员会。各大政党和各种政治派别都有代表参加：阿拉伯复兴社会党，国民党，人民党，伊斯兰运动会，独立民主人士和共产党。这个委员会曾经向全体阿拉伯人民发出号召，要求他们举行罢工和表示他们同埃及团结一致。
    为了响应这个号召，在黎巴嫩已经开展了一个以民族统一的口号为基础的巨大的群众运动。共产党和其他党派以及爱国力量都参加了这个运动。在约旦也已经成立了一个支援埃及的委员会，社会党，爱国党，复兴党，共产党和无党无派民主人士均有代表参加。
    在伊拉克，尽管伊拉克的统治者——巴格达条约的帮凶们实行恐怖政策，但所有的爱国人士包括伊拉克共产党在内业已实现了共同行动。
    至于埃及，民族的团结实际上已在一致拥护总统加麦尔·阿卜杜勒·纳赛尔所实行的爱国的和勇敢的政策上充分显示出来。
    这样，全世界人士亲眼看到了阿拉伯世界的一个伟大的群众性的爱国热潮。在八月十四、十五、十六三天内从马拉喀什到巴格达，参加示威游行和总罢工的达有八十万人，他们高呼着：“帝国主义者，在埃及面前，缩回你的魔爪吧！”
    要估量这个群众性高潮的重大意义，只要提一提为支援埃及而在大马士革举行的群众大会就可见一般了，这次大会集合了十五万工人、学生、妇女、商人、手工业者、个体劳动者、爱国的资本家以及农民的代表。
    这样，你们可以清楚地看到：埃及和所有阿拉伯人民同样地都抱定决心来保卫运河和他们的主权和民族独立的权利。
    阿拉伯人民知道得很清楚，在这个斗争中他们不是孤立的，整个强大的世界社会主义阵营是同他们站在一起的。……亚非各国人民站在他们一边，拉丁美洲各国人民站在他们一边，法国，英国和欧洲各国的工人阶级和正直的人们也都站在他们一边。
    伟大的苏联在伦敦会议上发出的呼声是埃及和所有阿拉伯人民事业的忠诚的维护者的呼声。苏联所发表的关于苏伊士运河的声明是一个对帝国主义者的明确而坚决的警告。
    人民中国无论在它历次发表的声明中，无论在这次大会上毛泽东同志的发言中，无论在万隆会议上周恩来同志的发言中，都已证明它是阿拉伯人民真挚的朋友，是民族解放运动的先驱和维护亚非和平的先锋队。
    各种政见不同的阿拉伯人向苏联、向人民中国、向各人民民主国家、向印度、印度尼西亚、锡兰、南斯拉夫、以及过去和现在支持他们的正义斗争的所有国家表示最深切的感谢。
    埃及和所有阿拉伯人民要求在尊重埃及对运河的主权的基础上，通过和平途径解决一切有关苏伊士运河航行的争执。
    但是，如果帝国主义者进行武装侵略以强行统治运河的话，那么阿尔及利亚的榜样就会表明什么事情在等候着他们，不仅在埃及而且在叙利亚和每一个阿拉伯国家里。阿尔及利亚勇敢的阿拉伯战士正在英勇地为争取民族独立和国家主权而奋斗，拿着武器打击法国帝国主义……。
    法国帝国主义的武装力量尽管野蛮残暴，却已经在镇压阿尔及利亚民族起义中失败了。所以，英法帝国主义者以及支持他们的美帝国主义者应该了解到其他阿拉伯人民是和阿尔及利亚人民同样英勇顽强的。
    而且，这些阿拉伯国家是独立的，它们所拥有的力量，当然更为巨大有力。
    我们叙利亚人民，肯定地对帝国主义者申明，如果他们竟敢以帝国主义的腐朽肮脏东西来沾污我们的国土或者埃及的国土的话，那么，在独立的叙利亚国家里，团结一致的叙利亚人民和叙利亚军队将把他们打得落花流水。
    同志们，
    在业已从外国占领下解放出来并获得民族独立的阿拉伯祖国的每一块地方，尤其是叙利亚、黎巴嫩和埃及的土地上，阿拉伯人民愿意在他们的家乡过和平的生活，他们愿意采取和平方法向着民主、经济繁荣和文化进步的道路上前进。
    我们有着取得这种和平进步的各种可能性和各种有利条件，但是帝国主义通过施行压力进行威胁和干涉内政等办法来阻挠这种和平的发展。
    当若干阿拉伯国家取得了政治上的独立，当外国军队由于这些国家的人民的斗争和新的国际形势而从它们的领土上撤退的时候，帝国主义者满心希望这种独立成为一纸空文，让他们用隐蔽的办法继续行使他们的权力并保持他们的实际统治和他们的剥削制度。
    但是走在阿拉伯世界解放运动前列的埃及与叙利亚，已经打断了帝国主义的锁链，已经行使了自己的主权和独立权利，它们正在着手发展工农业，为此，它们已开始扩大同社会主义阵营的政治和经济联系。
    最近，埃及和叙利亚已经是阿拉伯国家中首先同中华人民共和国建立外交关系的两个国家了。
    帝国主义用尽种种方法企图阻挠埃及和叙利亚的这种进步，它或者是直接施行压力，或者是时而利用土耳其，时而利用以色列，间接施行压力，自从这个国家成立以来，帝国主义者早已把他们变成反对阿拉伯民族解放运动的军事基地和他们手中的工具。帝国主义者曾采取这些施行压力的办法，企图迫使我们加入巴格达条约，他们曾经企图改变这些国家所选择的独立自由的方针。但是由于人民的抵抗和在反帝斗争中日益增进的军民友爱合作，帝国主义的一切高压手段均遭到了惨败。因此，目前帝国主义想找寻一个办法来重新占领我们的国土，重新建立对我们祖国的直接统治，以便阻挠阿拉伯人民在自由、独立和工农业、文化进步的道路上迈步前进。
    但是这不是容易的事……同志们，有了你们的支持和援助，我们一定要保卫我们的独立。
    有了你们的支持和援助，阿拉伯人民一定要将现在还被占领或是被帝国主义条约束缚的国家，完全解放出来。
    我们要继续在民族解放和经济文化发展的道路上前进。我们要在民主和完全脱离帝国主义统治的基础上实现阿拉伯民族的统一。
    同志们，
    作为叙利亚和黎巴嫩共产党人，我们从全世界共产党的先锋和老大哥——苏联共产党的第二十次代表大会上，学习到许多东西。第二十次代表大会是世界共产主义运动发展中的一个伟大的历史性的转折点。在以民族统一战线为基础，争取我们各个国家的解放和按照各国的民族和历史特点向着民主发展的道路和工农业、文化进步的道路迈进的斗争上，这次大会在我们阿拉伯共产党人面前展开了广阔的新的视线。
    今天，我们又在你们伟大的第八次代表大会上学习了你们过去光荣斗争的历史，也学习到如何在最广泛的范围内团结所有进步力量包括民族资产阶级在内实行反帝民族统一战线的政策。我们忠于我们的人民，忠于我们的祖国，忠于马克思列宁主义的原则。正如伟大的中国的经验所证明的那样，这些原则通向民族解放的道路，是求得真正的民主发展的道路，是阿拉伯各国人民所渴望的光荣地向社会主义前进的道路。
    在它的光荣的中央委员会领导下的伟大的中国共产党万岁！
    阿拉伯人的忠实的朋友和有力的支持者：以苏联为首的伟大的社会主义和平阵营万岁！阿拉伯国家和中国的友谊万岁！（附图片）
