    Struggle Against the Tendency to Weaken the Party's Leadership
    Comrade Ouyang Qin's Speech

    The Party's leadership plays a decisive role in all aspects of work – dangerous phenomena of unilaterally emphasizing administrative power and neglecting the Party's leadership role have occurred in industrial enterprises, rural areas, commercial enterprises, and schools – the social origins and special reasons for this phenomenon – struggles have been and are being waged against this phenomenon – a phenomenon has emerged where everything, no matter how trivial, is concentrated in the Party committee, causing the Party's leadership to fall into事務ism – it is necessary to help grassroots organizations learn to apply the principle of combining collective leadership with individual responsibility – carrying forward the Party's tradition of the mass line and overcoming subjectivism and bureaucracy is of particular importance for correctly exerting and strengthening the Party's leadership.

    I wholeheartedly endorse Comrade Mao Zedong's opening speech and fully agree with the three reports of the Central Committee and the draft Party Constitution, as well as the draft proposals for the Second Five-Year Plan. Now, based on the situation in Heilongjiang Province, I would like to offer some opinions on the issue of strengthening the Party's leadership.

    Heilongjiang Province is one of China's important industrial, agricultural, and forestry regions. In the eleven years since liberation, the province's political and economic landscape has undergone tremendous and profound changes. It has developed from a place with a weak industrial base to a province with a fairly strong machinery industry, forestry industry, and light industry. In 1955, the proportion of industrial output value in the total industrial and agricultural output value increased from 35.6 percent in 1949 to 56.8 percent. In agriculture, the grain output in 1955 was 8.2 million tons, an increase of 23.6 percent compared to the highest annual output before liberation. By the spring of this year, 98.7 percent of farmers in the province had joined advanced agricultural production cooperatives. The socialist transformation of capitalist industry, commerce, and handicrafts has also achieved decisive victories. Private industries converted to joint state-private ownership account for 96.6 percent of their total output value, private commercial enterprises converted to joint state-private ownership, cooperative shops, and sales agencies account for 89.1 percent of their total number of households, and 96.7 percent of individual handicraft households have joined cooperative organizations. All these changes have been achieved under the leadership of the Party Central Committee, headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, with the active efforts of the Party organizations and the people of the province. Therefore, fundamentally speaking, the Party's leadership has undoubtedly played a huge and decisive role in our province's work. However, we have also experienced some shortcomings and deviations in the issue of Party leadership, which have caused considerable losses to our work.

    In the initial years after liberation, the leadership methods of many Party organizations were basically "all-encompassing." This was necessary under the historical circumstances at the time. Later, with the development of the cause, Party organizations and administrative organizations gradually had a clear division of labor, but in some units, a tendency emerged to unilaterally emphasize administrative power, neglecting and weakening the Party's leadership role. After the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party in the spring of 1954, we criticized and largely overcame this tendency. However, in the past year, there has been a deviation where some individuals are afraid to take responsibility, fail to fully utilize the role of administrative organs, and concentrate everything, no matter how trivial, in the Party committee, causing the Party's leadership to fall into事務ism, which actually also weakens the Party's leadership role.

    The tendency to unilaterally emphasize administrative power and neglect the Party's leadership role was, for a time, more serious and widespread in industrial enterprises. Many comrades, citing reasons such as "the Party committee doesn't understand the business," "the factory director is the representative of the state," and "the Party organization in the enterprise is different from the local Party organization," advocated that the Party organization in the enterprise should only play a guaranteeing role and should not conduct leadership and supervision. Some even said: "Supervision is distrust," and "If the Party leads and supervises, the Party committee should be responsible for any problems that occur in the enterprise." Under the dominance of this viewpoint, in some enterprises, the Party organization actually became an appendage of the administrative organization. Some enterprises did not even raise major issues such as how to ensure the implementation of the state plan for discussion at the Party committee meeting. Some cadres even said: "The Party's leadership is just a hindrance," and "As long as you give me tools and people, I can complete the task without a Party organization." These arguments actually deny the Party's leadership role.

    Neglecting and weakening the Party's leadership role is inevitably accompanied by a decrease in the Party organization's prestige, the weakening of political and ideological work, and the fading of the mass perspective and the Party's tradition of the mass line. In enterprises, relying solely on administrative orders without emphasizing persuasion and education, without respecting the democratic rights of workers, without paying attention to listening to workers' opinions, and without caring about the sufferings of the masses, bureaucratic and commandist styles grew, seriously suppressing the enthusiasm of workers. Due to the weakening of the Party's leadership role, some of the Party and state's policies in industrial production and construction could not be correctly implemented under the Party's supervision, the level of management and technology could not be improved as it should have been, while capitalist business ideas, as well as individualism, arrogance, and departmentalism, grew somewhat, and disunity among cadres increased.

    This tendency to unilaterally emphasize administrative power and neglect the Party's leadership role has recently also occurred in rural areas. This year, after our province's rural areas achieved advanced collectivization, some Party members in rural areas believed that "the task of agricultural collectivization has been completed, now it is just about production, and the Party's leadership is not needed." "The branch committee members are all management committee members of the cooperative, and a hundred monks chant the same scripture, so there is no need to hold branch meetings." "Advanced cooperatives pay according to labor, so no education is needed, and members can work actively." Therefore, in some agricultural production cooperatives, only the leadership of the management committee was seen, and not the leadership of the branch; only management committee meetings were held, and not branch meetings; only member meetings were held, and not Party member meetings; only economic work was emphasized, and not political work. As a result, cadres developed a commandist style; Party members thought that the task was accomplished and did not ask about politics, only focusing on production; and some members also developed phenomena such as only caring about work points, disregarding the quality of labor, and not cherishing public property.

    This phenomenon of unilaterally emphasizing administrative power and neglecting the Party's leadership role has also occurred or existed to varying degrees in some commercial enterprises and schools.

    Our country is a country led by the working class, and the Party is the highest organizational form of the working class. The Chinese revolution was victorious under the leadership of our Party, and the cause of socialist construction in China can only be victorious under the leadership of our Party. These are all principles well known to our comrades. But why does such a tendency to neglect and weaken the Party's leadership role emerge in the actual work of our socialist economic and cultural construction? We believe that this has profound roots.

    As pointed out in the article "On the Historical Experience of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat," "When the revolution is victorious, and the working class and the Communist Party have become the leading class and party of the national regime, the leading staff of our Party and state, due to being attacked by bureaucracy from many sides, face a great danger of using state organs to act arbitrarily, detach themselves from the masses, detach themselves from collective leadership, practice commandism, and damage the democratic system of the Party and the state." Unilaterally emphasizing administrative power and neglecting the Party's leadership is precisely a concrete reflection of this danger.

    Among our Party members, many come from the petty bourgeoisie, and outside the Party, there is still the influence of a vast number of small producers. At the same time, our Party is also constantly subjected to the erosion of bourgeois ideology. The petty-bourgeois ideology is basically manifested in the subjectivity and one-sidedness when observing problems, and the tendency in organizational life is easily manifested as individualism that is detached from the masses, while the erosion of bourgeois ideology more easily forms and promotes individualism, arrogance, and bureaucracy. This is another social root cause of the tendency to neglect the Party's leadership role in our work.

    From the perspective of Heilongjiang Province, the emergence of the tendency to neglect the Party's leadership role also has its special reasons, which is the influence of Gao Gang. When Gao Gang worked in Northeast China in the past, he tried his best to unilaterally emphasize administrative power in enterprises, spread bourgeois individualist ideas, weakened the cadre allocation of Party organizations in enterprises, and greatly reduced the Party's leadership role. His viewpoint and practice greatly contributed to the phenomenon of neglecting the Party's leadership role. At that time, the leadership of our province lacked the sensitivity and resistance to Gao Gang's viewpoint and practice. After the Fourth Plenary Session, although the provincial Party committee resolutely criticized the tendency to neglect the Party's leadership role, the understanding of the leadership system of enterprises and schools gradually became clear and consistent only under the instructions of the Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong. At the same time, some comrades in the business departments also sympathized with and supported some one-sided viewpoints among enterprise cadres in the past. These also had a certain impact on the growth of the above-mentioned tendency to neglect the Party's leadership role.

    Of course, the reasons for the emergence of the phenomenon of neglecting the Party's leadership role are not entirely the same in different departments and among different comrades. For example, the reasons for the emergence of the tendency to neglect the Party's leadership role in agricultural production cooperatives and enterprises are not completely the same. Therefore, a concrete analysis based on facts must be made on this issue.

    In view of the serious harm of the tendency to neglect the Party's leadership role, after the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party, the Heilongjiang Provincial Party Organization, based on the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session and in conjunction with eliminating the influence of Gao Gang, carried out a series of struggles against this tendency, especially against this tendency in industrial enterprises. Last August, we specifically convened a political work conference on industry to examine and criticize this tendency. The phenomena of neglecting the Party's leadership role in commercial enterprises and schools were also criticized at the financial and trade work conference and the cultural and educational work conference that were subsequently convened. At the Party Congress held not long ago, the phenomena of weakening the Party's leadership and ideological and political work that have recently emerged in agricultural production cooperatives were also examined.

    After a series of work, especially after the Central Committee clearly instructed that the system of collective leadership by the Party committee should also be implemented in enterprises and schools, the above-mentioned phenomena of neglecting and weakening the Party's leadership role have been overcome to varying degrees in ideological and practical work, especially in industrial enterprises, where there has been a great transformation. In many enterprises, the leading backbone of the Party organization has been adjusted and strengthened, the prestige of the Party organization has been improved, the Party's collective leadership has been strengthened, the phenomenon of disunity among cadres has been reduced, the Party's ideological and political work has been strengthened, the style of the mass line is relatively stronger, and the completion of production and construction plans is more guaranteed. However, at present, for the province as a whole, this problem has not been universally and thoroughly resolved. In commercial enterprises and schools, the transformation of leadership ideology has not been long, and the problems in agricultural cooperatives are still being addressed. Although the problems in industrial enterprises were resolved earlier and more deeply, the ideological problems of some comrades have not been thoroughly resolved.

    After criticizing the tendency to neglect the Party's leadership role, a phenomenon has emerged in some enterprises where everything, no matter how trivial, is concentrated in the Party committee, causing the Party's leadership to fall into事務ism. The emergence of this phenomenon is partly due to a lack of comprehensive and correct understanding of the relationship between collective leadership and individual responsibility, and between the Party's leadership and administrative leadership. Therefore, when the phenomenon of unilaterally emphasizing individual roles and administrative power is criticized, it goes to another extreme where individuals are afraid to take responsibility, do not dare to use administrative power, or the Party committee does not attach importance to giving play to the roles of administrative organs and individuals. The emergence of this phenomenon is also greatly related to the lack of leadership experience of cadres. Because of the lack of experience, they are not good at distinguishing which issues should be discussed and decided by the Party committee and which issues should be resolved independently by administrative organs and relevant individuals, and they raise all matters for discussion by the Party committee, making the Party's leadership administrative and事務istic. This phenomenon is also caused by the ideological and work style problems of a few cadres. Some comrades, because of individualistic emotions, have adopted an irresponsible attitude after the erroneous viewpoints have been criticized, and blame everything on the Party committee; others, who are Party affairs workers, like to take care of everything, so after emphasizing strengthening the Party's leadership, they turn the Party's leadership into a package deal to replace administrative work. However, no matter what the cause of this phenomenon is, the result is to weaken the Party's leadership, rather than strengthen the Party's leadership. Therefore, in order to effectively strengthen the Party's leadership role, it is necessary to carry out struggles on two fronts: it is necessary to continue to thoroughly overcome the thinking and practice of unilaterally emphasizing administrative power and neglecting the Party's leadership role, and it is also necessary to prevent and correct the bias that individuals are afraid to take responsibility or are irresponsible, or that the Party committee takes care of everything in place of administrative work and does not attach importance to giving play to the role of administrative organizations. To this end, it is necessary to continue to profoundly explain to the broad masses of cadres the principle that there is no socialism without the Party's leadership, the necessity and correctness of implementing the leadership system of combining collective leadership by the Party committee with individual responsibility, based on the Leninist principle that the Party is the highest organizational form of the working class and the Party's democratic centralism, as well as the actual experience and historical traditions of our Party in carrying out the cause of revolution and construction, so as to enable everyone to consciously safeguard and strengthen the Party's leadership role, and to accept the leadership system of combining collective leadership with individual responsibility with heartfelt sincerity. At the same time, it is also necessary to make the broad masses of cadres thoroughly understand the unified and indispensable relationship between collective leadership and individual responsibility, understand the principle that administrative power cannot be strengthened by weakening the Party's leadership, and that weakening administrative functions will inevitably weaken the Party's leadership, and help grassroots organizations to constantly summarize practical experience and learn to appropriately apply the principle of combining collective leadership with individual responsibility.

    In order to thoroughly overcome the tendency to neglect and weaken the Party's leadership role and correctly implement the leadership system of combining collective leadership by the Party committee with individual responsibility, there must also be organizational guarantees. That is to strengthen the Party's grassroots organizations and adjust and strengthen the leading backbone of the Party organizations. In our province, in the past, due to the influence of neglecting the Party's leadership, the leading cadres of the Party organizations were generally weaker than the administrative cadres at the same level, whether in industrial and commercial enterprises or schools, and some were even very different. Since last year, although we have made preliminary adjustments to the Party affairs work cadres in industrial enterprises according to the Central Committee's instructions and the principle of "roughly equivalent," the situation has not been completely changed as a whole. The work of adjusting cadres in commercial enterprises and schools is still in the beginning stages. These problems need to be further resolved with the support of the relevant departments of the Central Committee. We will also take measures to change the situation in which the Party's leading backbone has been weakened in some agricultural production cooperatives after advanced collectivization.

    Strengthening the Party's leadership role also requires a correct leadership style and leadership methods. At present, in our province's Party leadership work, subjectivism and bureaucracy are still relatively widespread and serious, work is not thorough or concrete, there is a lack of inspection of the implementation of work, a lack of systematic and meticulous investigation and research of the actual situation, insufficient understanding and concern for the hardships of the masses' lives, and in some places there is still a commandist style towards the masses and sectarian sentiments towards non-Party members. All of these cannot but affect the Party's connection with the masses and the full play of the masses' enthusiasm, thereby reducing the Party's leadership role. Therefore, currently emphasizing carrying forward the Party's tradition of the mass line and overcoming subjectivism and bureaucracy is of particular importance for correctly exerting and strengthening the Party's leadership role. To this end, it is necessary to earnestly study the five documents stipulated by the Central Committee, conduct inspections in connection with reality, and at the same time carry out some necessary and serious reforms in the system, organizational structure, and work methods, in order to truly establish a style of seeking truth from facts, investigation and research, linking with reality, and linking with the masses.

    The experiences and lessons learned in the issue of Party leadership over the past few years have made us deeply realize that only by strengthening the Party's leadership can we implement the mass line and give play to the enthusiasm of the masses; only then can we correctly exert the role of administrative organs and rapidly improve business and technical levels; and only by adopting the leadership methods of the mass line can we concentrate the wisdom, experience, and demands of the masses, making the Party's leadership correct and powerful. Neglecting the Party's leadership will inevitably weaken the mass line; neglecting the mass line will also inevitably weaken the Party's leadership. As long as there is the Party's strong leadership and the mass line is implemented in all work, this is equivalent to fundamentally guaranteeing the victory of the socialist cause.

    We believe that under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, as long as we earnestly study Marxism-Leninism, conscientiously implement the resolutions of this conference, strengthen and correctly exert the Party's leadership role in various tasks, carry forward the Party's tradition of the mass line, and continue to earnestly study the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and fraternal parties, we will be able to mobilize all positive factors and continuously push the socialist cause to new victories.

    同削弱党的领导作用的倾向作斗争
    欧阳钦同志的发言
    党的领导在各方面工作中起了决定性的作用——在工业企业、农村、商业企业、学校中，都曾发生过片面强调行政权力、忽视党的领导作用的危险现象——产生这种现象的社会根源和特殊原因——已经和正在对这种现象进行斗争——又出现了一种事无巨细都集中于党委，使党的领导陷于事务主义的现象——要帮助基层组织学会运用集体领导与个人负责相结合的原则——发扬党的群众路线传统，克服主观主义、官僚主义，对于正确地发挥和加强党的领导作用有特别重要的意义。
    我衷心拥护毛泽东同志的开幕词，完全同意中央委员会的三个报告和党章草案及关于第二个五年计划的建议草案。现在，我仅就黑龙江省的情况，对加强党的领导作用问题提出一点意见。
    黑龙江省是我国的重要工业、农业、林业地区之一。解放后十一年来，这个省的政治经济面貌发生了巨大而深刻的变化。它已经由一个原来工业基础很薄弱的地方发展成为拥有相当强大的机械工业、森林工业和轻工业的省份，一九五五年，工业产值在工农业总产值中的比重已经由一九四九年的占百分之三十五点六上升到占百分之五十六点八。在农业方面，一九五五年产粮八百二十万吨，比解放前最高年产量提高了百分之二十三点六，到今年春季全省已有百分之九十八点七的农户参加了高级农业生产合作社。对资本主义工商业和手工业的社会主义改造也已经取得了决定性的胜利，私营工业转为公私合营的已占其总产值的百分之九十六点六，私营商业转为公私合营、合作商店和经销代销的已占其总户数的百分之八十九点一，个体手工业户已有百分之九十六点七参加了合作组织。所有这些变化都是在以毛泽东同志为首的党中央的领导下，全省党组织领导全省人民积极努力而取得的。因此，从基本的方面来说，在我省工作中，党的领导毫无疑问是起了巨大的决定性的作用。但是我们在党的领导的问题上也曾经发生过一些缺点和偏向，使工作受到不少的损失。
    在解放后的最初几年中，许多党组织的领导方法基本上是“一揽子”的。这在当时的历史情况下是必要的。后来，随着事业的发展，党组织和行政组织逐渐有了明确的分工，但是在有些单位中发生了一种片面强调行政权力、忽视和削弱党的领导作用的倾向。在一九五四年春党的七届四中全会以后，我们批判了并在很大程度上克服了这种倾向，但一年以来，又出现了某些个人不敢负责、不充分发挥行政机构的作用、事无巨细都集中于党委的偏向，使党的领导陷于事务主义，实际上也还是削弱党的领导作用。
    片面强调行政权力、忽视党的领导作用的倾向，一个时期在工业企业中是表现得比较严重和普遍的。不少同志曾以“党委不懂业务”、“厂长是国家代表”、“企业党组织不同于地方党组织”等等为理由，主张企业中的党组织只能起保证作用，而不能进行领导和监督。有的还说：“监督就是不信任”，“如果党领导监督，企业中发生问题就应由党委负责。”在这种观点的支配之下，在有些企业中，党组织实际上变成了行政组织的附属机构。有的企业甚至连如何保证执行国家计划这样的重大问题都不提到党委会议上讨论。有的干部甚至说：“党的领导就是碍手碍脚”，“只要给我工具，给我人，没有党组织一样完成任务”。这些论调实际上是否认了党的领导作用。
    忽视和削弱党的领导作用，伴随而来的不能不是党组织威信的降低，政治思想工作的削弱，群众观念和党的群众路线传统的淡薄。在企业中单纯依靠行政命令而不重视说服教育、不尊重职工民主权利、不注意听取职工意见、不关心群众痛痒等官僚主义、命令主义作风滋长起来，严重地抑制了职工的积极性。由于党的领导作用的被削弱，党和国家在工业生产建设中的一些政策不能在党的监督下正确地贯彻执行，管理水平和技术水平得不到应有的提高，而资本主义的经营思想以及个人主义、骄傲情绪、本位主义却有所滋长，干部之间的不团结现象也日益增多。
    这种片面强调行政权力忽视党的领导作用的倾向，最近在农村中也有发生。今年我省农村实现了高级合作化以后，有些农村中的党员认为“农业合作化的任务已经完成了，现在只是搞生产，用不着党的领导了。”“支部委员都是社的管理委员，一百个和尚念的也是一本经，用不着开支部会了。”“高级社按劳取酬，不用教育，社员也能积极劳动了。”因此，在一些农业生产合作社中，只看见有管理委员会的领导，而看不见支部的领导；只开管理委员会，不开支部会；只开社员会议，不开党员会议；只重视经济工作，不重视政治工作。其结果是干部滋长了命令主义作风；党员以为大功告成，不问政治，只顾生产；社员中也发生了一些只顾工分、不顾劳动质量、不爱护公共财物等现象。
    这种片面地强调行政权力、忽视党的领导作用的现象在一些商业企业和学校中也曾在不同程度上发生过或存在着。
    我们的国家是工人阶级领导的国家，党是工人阶级的最高组织形式。中国革命是在我们党的领导之下取得胜利的，中国的社会主义建设事业也只有在我党的领导下才能取得胜利。这都是我们的同志所熟知的道理。可是为什么在我们的社会主义经济文化建设的实际工作中，竟会出现这样一种忽视和削弱党的领导作用的倾向呢？我们认为这是有其深刻的根源的。
    正像“关于无产阶级专政的历史经验”一文中所指出的，“当革命胜利之后，在工人阶级和共产党已经成为领导全国政权的阶级和政党的时候，我们党和国家的领导工作人员，由于受到官僚主义的多方面的袭击，就面临到有可能利用国家机关独断独行、脱离群众、脱离集体领导、实行命令主义、破坏党和国家的民主制度的这样一个很大的危险性。”片面强调行政权力，忽视党的领导，就正是这种危险性的一个具体反映。
    在我们的党员中，有不少人出身于小资产阶级，在党外，还存在着广大的小生产者的影响，同时我们党也还经常受着资产阶级思想的侵袭。小资产阶级的思想方法基本上表现为观察问题时的主观性和片面性，在组织生活上的倾向容易表现为脱离群众的个人主义，而资产阶级思想的侵蚀则更容易形成和助长个人主义、骄傲情绪和官僚主义。这又是在我们的工作中产生忽视党的领导作用的倾向的社会根源。
    从黑龙江省的情况说来，忽视党的领导作用的倾向的产生也还有其特殊的原因，这即是高岗的影响。高岗过去在东北工作的时候，极力片面强调企业中的行政权力，散播资产阶级个人主义思想，削弱企业党组织的干部配备，大大降低了党的领导作用。他的这种观点和作法在很大程度上助长了忽视党的领导作用的现象。对于高岗的这种观点和作法，当时我们省的领导上是缺乏嗅觉和抵制的。四中全会以后，省委虽然坚决地批判了忽视党的领导作用的倾向，但对于企业以及学校等单位的领导制度问题的认识，也还是在中央和毛泽东同志的指示下才逐渐趋于明确和一致。同时，过去在业务部门中也曾有某些同志同情和支持了企业干部中的一些片面观点。这些对于上述忽视党的领导作用的倾向的滋长也是有一定影响的。
    当然，在不同的部门和不同的同志中，产生忽视党的领导作用的现象，其产生的原因是不尽相同的。例如农业生产合作社中和企业中的忽视党的领导作用的倾向的产生，其原因就不是完全相同的。因此，在这一问题上又必须作实事求是的具体分析。
    鉴于忽视党的领导作用的倾向的严重危害性，黑龙江省党组织在党的七届四中全会以后，就根据四中全会的精神，结合着肃清高岗影响，对这种倾向，首先是对工业企业中的这种倾向进行了一系列的斗争。去年八月我们曾专门召集了一次工业政治工作会议检查和批判了这种倾向。对商业企业和学校中的忽视党的领导作用的现象，也都在其后召开的财贸工作会议和文教工作会议上进行了批判。在不久以前召开的党代表大会上，又对最近在农业生产合作社中出现的削弱党的领导和思想政治工作的现象进行了检查。
    经过一系列的工作之后，特别是在中央明确指示在企业和学校中同样实行党委集体领导的制度以后，上述各种忽视和削弱党的领导作用的现象，在思想上和实际工作中都已有了不同程度的克服，特别是在工业企业中，更有很大的转变。在不少企业中已经调整和加强了党组织的领导骨干，党组织的威信提高了，党的集体领导加强了，干部不团结的现象减少了，党的思想政治工作加强了，群众路线的作风比较浓厚了，生产建设计划的完成也更有保证了。但是目前就全省来说，这一问题还没有得到普遍的彻底的解决。商业企业和学校中，领导思想的转变，时间还不长，农业社中的问题还正在着手解决。工业企业中的问题虽然解决得较早，较深，但仍有些同志的思想问题还没有彻底解决。
    在批判了忽视党的领导作用的倾向之后，在有些企业中又出现了一种事无巨细都集中于党委、使党的领导陷于事务主义的现象。这种现象的产生，有的是由于对集体领导和个人负责以及党的领导和行政领导的关系缺乏全面的、正确的理解，因而当片面强调个人作用和行政权力的现象受到了批判以后，又走到个人不敢负责、不敢运用行政权力或党委不重视发挥行政机构和个人的作用的另一个极端。这种现象的产生，也与干部的领导经验不足有很大的关系。因为经验不足，所以不善于区分那些问题应由党委讨论决定，那些问题应由行政机构和有关个人自行负责解决，而把一切事情都提到党委讨论，使党的领导行政化、事务化起来。这种现象也还有少数是由于干部思想作风上的毛病产生的。有的同志因为有个人主义情绪，所以当错误的观点受到批判之后，就采取了不负责任的态度，事事诿之于党委；也有的党务工作同志喜欢包揽一切，所以在强调了加强党的领导之后，把党的领导变成了对于行政工作的包办代替。但不论这种现象的产生出于何种原因，其结果却都是削弱党的领导，而不是加强党的领导。因此，为切实地加强党的领导作用就必须进行两个方面的斗争：既要继续彻底克服片面强调行政权力而忽视党的领导作用的思想和作法，也必须防止和纠正个人不敢负责、不负责任，或党委包办代替行政工作、不重视发挥行政组织作用的这一种偏向。为此，需要根据党是工人阶级的最高组织形式和党的民主集中制的列宁主义原则以及我党进行革命与建设事业的实际经验和历史传统，继续深刻地向广大干部讲明没有党的领导就没有社会主义的道理，讲明实行党委集体领导与个人负责相结合的领导制度的必要性和正确性，以便使大家自觉地去维护和加强党的领导作用，心悦诚服地接受以党为核心的集体领导与个人负责相结合的领导制度。同时，也要使广大干部透彻地了解集体领导与个人负责的统一的、不可偏废的关系，了解不能以削弱党的领导来加强行政权力、削弱行政职能也必然会削弱党的领导的道理，并帮助基层组织不断地总结实际经验，学会恰当地运用集体领导与个人负责相结合的原则。
    为彻底克服忽视和削弱党的领导作用的倾向，正确地执行党委集体领导与个人负责相结合的领导制度，还必须有组织上的保证。这就是要加强党的基层组织，调整和加强党组织的领导骨干。在我省，过去由于忽视党的领导的影响，不论在工商企业或学校中，党组织的领导干部一般都是较同级行政干部为弱，有的甚至是相差悬殊的。去年以来，我们虽曾根据中央指示，按“大体相当”的原则，对工业企业中的党务工作干部进行了初步调整，但整个说来情况还没有完全改变。商业企业和学校中的干部调整工作则尚在开始着手。这些问题都需要在中央有关部门的支持下进一步求得解决。对高级合作化后有些农业生产合作社中党的领导骨干减弱的情况，我们也将要采取措施加以改变。
    加强党的领导作用，还必须有正确的领导作风和领导方法。目前在我省党的领导工作中，主观主义和官僚主义还是比较普遍和严重的，工作不深入、不具体，缺少对于工作执行情况的检查，缺乏对于实际情况的系统的、周密的调查研究，对于群众生活疾苦的了解和关心不够，有些地方还存在着对群众的命令主义作风和对党外人士的宗派主义情绪。所有这些都不能不影响党与群众的联系和群众积极性的充分发挥，从而也就不能不降低党的领导作用。因此，当前强调发扬党的群众路线传统，克服主观主义、官僚主义，对于正确地发挥和加强党的领导作用有特别重要的意义。为此，需要认真地学习中央所规定的五个文件联系实际进行检查，同时从体制上、组织机构上、工作方法上进行一些必要的和认真的改革，以切实树立实事求是、调查研究、联系实际、联系群众的作风。
    几年来，在党的领导问题上的经验教训使我们深切体会到：只有加强了党的领导，才能贯彻执行群众路线，发扬群众的积极性；才能正确地发挥行政机构的作用，迅速地提高业务与技术水平；也只有采取群众路线的领导方法，才能集中群众的智慧、经验和要求，使党的领导正确和有力。忽视党的领导必然会削弱群众路线；忽视群众路线也必然会削弱党的领导。只要有党的坚强的领导，并在一切工作中贯彻执行群众路线，这就等于从根本上保证了社会主义事业的胜利。
    我们相信：在党中央和毛泽东同志的英明领导下，只要我们认真地学习马克思列宁主义，切实贯彻执行这次大会的决议，加强和正确地发挥党在各种工作中的领导作用，发扬党的群众路线的传统，并继续认真地学习苏联及各兄弟党的先进经验，我们就一定能调动一切积极因素，把社会主义事业不断地推向新的胜利。
