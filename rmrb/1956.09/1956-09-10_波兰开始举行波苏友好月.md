Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, September 9th. Poland began its traditional Soviet-Polish Friendship Month on September 8th. On this day, an opening ceremony for the Friendship Month was held in the Palace of Culture and Science in Warsaw.

Polish newspapers pointed out that this year's Soviet-Polish Friendship Month is being held at a time when the Polish working class and its party are drawing lessons from the results of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The newspapers said that the Soviet Union's assistance and experience in socialist construction remain a major factor in Poland's construction. Poland will draw from the Soviet experience those experiences that best suit Poland's needs.

Some leaders of the Polish United Workers' Party and other parties, representatives of Polish public organizations and cultural and scientific circles, and a delegation from the Soviet Union's Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries participated in the opening ceremony of the Friendship Month.
