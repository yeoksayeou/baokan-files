    Hunan Fishery Production Cooperatives Actively Prepare to Greet the Autumn Flood

    Fishery cooperatives in various counties of Hunan Province are actively organizing labor, repairing and adding to boats, nets and tools, and preparing to welcome the peak season of the autumn flood. The rural work departments of most prefectural and county Party committees have convened meetings attended by relevant departments to study the issue of guaranteeing the supply of means of production and means of livelihood for fishermen. The Changde Special District has issued more than 60,000 yuan in fishery production loans to twelve counties and cities. Supply and marketing cooperatives in various places have also promptly supplied tung oil, hemp and other materials needed for fishery production.

    Thanks to the support from all sides and the timely work, many fishery cooperatives have put into production earlier than in previous years. For example, the Red Flag Cooperative in Nanxian County went into full-scale lake production in early August. Chen Qingfu, the captain of the brigade, said: "In the past, when it was time to go out to the lake, nothing was ready. This year, after being organized, we not only have everything prepared, but we also went out to the lake a month or so earlier." (Qin Yuan Fan Jie)

    湖南渔业生产合作社积极准备迎接秋汛
    湖南省各县渔业社，正在积极组织劳力，修添船网工具，准备迎接秋汛旺季。大部地委和县委农村工作部门都召开了有关部门参加的会议，研究保证渔民生产资料和生活资料的供应问题。常德专区有十二个县、市已发放渔业生产贷款六万多元，各地供销社也都及时供应了桐油和麻等渔业生产所需要的资料。
    由于各方面的支持，工作做的及时，许多渔业社都比往年提前投入生产了。如南县红旗社在8月初就已全部出湖生产。大队长陈庆福说：“过去到该出湖的时候，样样都没搞好，今年组织起来后，不但东西准备得齐全，还提早了个把月出湖。”　　（沁沅　繁杰）
