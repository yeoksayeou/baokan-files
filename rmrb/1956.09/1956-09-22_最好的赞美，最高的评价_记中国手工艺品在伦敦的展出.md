    The Best Praise, the Highest Evaluation
    – On the Exhibition of Chinese Handicrafts in London –
    By our correspondent Su Lan
    Along the corridor hung large red palace lanterns, and the window lattices of the octagonal pavilion were covered with grape vines. Purplish-red grapes hung heavily on the tips of the green branches. It was beneath this Chinese-style courtyard building that nine hundred kinds of Chinese handicrafts were exhibited. These handicrafts received more than ten thousand visitors every day. On Saturday afternoons, the number of visitors doubled. The exquisite and beautiful handicrafts of China caused a sensation throughout London.
    The British people's praise for Chinese handicrafts can be seen from their comments in the opinion book. The opinion book is often filled with words of praise and commendation like: "Excellent!" "Extremely beautiful!" "Beyond description!"... To more concretely illustrate the visitors' impressions of the Chinese pavilion, here are some excerpts of their thoughts.
    "These carved tools can only be created by artists with profound feelings and love for the people and the country."
    "This is the best exhibition, and it shows what free people can do."
    "Such beautiful things can only come from intelligent and kind people."
    "This exhibition clearly shows that we have a lot to learn from the East."
    Just a trip to the Chinese pavilion is enough to know that these praises are an outpouring of the audience's sincere emotions. Visitors felt a sense of novelty towards every exhibit from China. Many people told me that they had never seen anything like it before. Many of them were visiting the exhibition for the third or fourth time. Women were reluctant to leave the embroidery and lace exhibits, while men especially appreciated the ivory and jade carvings. Beside the ivory carvings, visitors formed long queues, unable to imagine how the scenery of the Ten Thousand寿 (Shou) Hill could be carved on such a small piece of ivory.
    In front of Lang Shao'an's dough figurine performance stand, it was always crowded. People craned their necks and watched with great interest as a small piece of dough transformed into various lifelike figures in his hands. Spending ten shillings to buy a small dough figurine was not a small expense for ordinary Britons. However, the demand for dough figurines exceeded the supply. As soon as a small dough figurine's head was formed, many people shouted, "I want to pre-order one."
    I saw a letter from Waters to Lang Shao'an. It said, "I was amazed to see that human hands could so delicately and skillfully knead a very small ball of dough into an elegant little girl wearing a floral shirt and a flower crown! Even if I hadn't seen anything else in this hall, seeing only the Chinese exhibition hall, especially your work, would have made my trip to London worthwhile..."
    Another group of people surrounded Gu Wenxia, a famous embroidery master, watching her perform embroidery. They were surprised to see how two lifelike kittens were embroidered with a needle thinner than a thread. The kittens opened their mouths, waved their claws, and seemed ready to leap out. Seeing this, women often let out a long "Ah" or stuck out their tongues.
    The sensation caused by Chinese handicrafts in London can also be seen from the following: A couple who had recently divorced, the man came to visit the Chinese pavilion, and felt that it would be an unforgivable sin if he did not notify his former wife to come and see it. He didn't wait until he got home and called her from the exhibition hall. In addition, an old lady had bought a dough figurine twenty years ago, but unfortunately lost it during the Second World War. When she heard that the Chinese pavilion was selling dough figurines this time, she insisted on coming to buy one, despite her illness. However, because she was old and weak, she fainted after arriving at the Chinese pavilion.
    The love for Chinese handicrafts led the audience to make various requests. They requested to see ivory and jade carving performances next time; they requested the Chinese pavilion to exhibit separately in other cities in the United Kingdom. And more requests were to increase the variety and quantity of the sales department.
    In the sales department, people were often packed tightly. On the opening day of the exhibition, seven of the eight sets of Chinese porcelain tea sets in the sales department were sold in less than two hours. Housewives carefully selected straw-woven baskets and beautiful lace.
    The first exhibition of Chinese handicrafts in the United Kingdom has given the British people a further understanding of New China. They very much hope to strengthen economic and cultural ties with the Chinese people. An engineer named Crump said with emotion: "Manufacturing these things is much better than manufacturing atomic bombs. We should learn from you how to live!" (Attached picture)
    The audience was particularly interested in Lang Shao'an's dough figurine performance.

    最好的赞美，最高的评价
    ——记中国手工艺品在伦敦的展出——
    本报记者　苏蓝
    沿着回廊挂着大红宫灯，八角亭榭的窗格上爬满了葡萄藤，紫红色的葡萄沉甸甸地垂在绿枝梢头，就在这个中国式的庭院建筑的下面，展览着九百种中国手工艺品。这些手工艺品每天接待着一万多名客人。逢到星期六下午，观众更增加一倍。中国精致美丽的手工艺术，轰动了整个伦敦。
    英国人民对中国手工艺品的称赞，可以从他们在意见簿上的留言中看出来。在意见簿上经常充满了这些称颂和赞美的字眼：“太好了！”“美极了！”“无法形容！”……为了更具体地说明参观者对中国馆的印象，在这里不妨摘录一些人的感想。
    “这些雕刻器具，只能是对人民和国家有深刻的感情和爱的艺术家，才能创造出来的。”
    “这是一个最好的展览，它表明自由的人民可以作些什么。”
    “这样美的东西，只能来自聪明和善良的人民。”
    “这个展览会清楚地表明了，我们有很多东西是要向东方学习。”
    只要到中国馆转上一遭，就可以知道这些赞美是观众真挚感情的流露。参观者对中国的每一件展览品，都感到新奇。许多人告诉我：他们从来没有看见过这样的东西。他们中间有不少人都是第三次或者第四次来参观这个展览会。妇女们在刺绣和花边的展品前不肯移步；男人们则对象牙、玉石的雕刻特别欣赏；在象牙雕刻的展品旁边，参观的人排成了长队，他们不能想像：在这么一点点象牙上，可以刻出万寿山的风景。
    在郎绍安捏面人的表演台前，经常是拥挤不堪。人们引颈翘首，兴趣盎然地看着一小块面粉，如何在他的手中变成各种各样的活生生的人物。花十个先令买一个小面人，这对普通的英国人来说是一项不算小的开支。但，面人却是供不应求。一个小面人刚刚捏出个头，就有许多人大声喊叫：“我要预定一个。”
    我看到一封沃特尔斯给郎绍安的信。其中这样说：“看到人的双手能够如此精细巧妙地把很小一团面粉揉成个身着花衫、头戴花朵的雅致的小姑娘，真使我大吃一惊！即使我在这个大厅里什么也没有看到，只看到中国的展览馆，特别是你的工作的话，我到伦敦的这次旅行也是值得的了。……”
    另外一群人把刺绣名手顾文霞团团围住，看她作刺绣表演。他们吃惊地看到用一根比线还细的细针，绣成这么栩栩如生的两只小猫。小猫张着口舞着爪，跃跃欲出。看到这里妇女们往往“啊”地长吁一声，或者伸出自己的舌头。
    中国手工艺品在伦敦所引起的轰动，还可以从这样一些事情上看出：有一对夫妇刚刚离婚不久，男的来到中国馆参观以后，总觉得如果不通知他过去的妻子前来看看，真是桩不能饶恕的罪过。他没有等到回家，就在展览馆里给她打了个电话。另外，有一位老太太，二十年前曾经买过一个面人，可惜在第二次世界大战时丢了。这次听说中国馆有面人出售，她顾不得自己身体的多病，非要赶来买一个不可。但因为年迈力衰，在来到中国馆后，就晕倒了。
    对中国手工艺品的爱好，使观众们提出了各种各样的要求。他们要求下一次能看到象牙和玉石的雕刻表演；要求中国馆单独到英国其他城市去展出。而更多的要求，是希望增加卖品部的品种和数量。
    在卖品部里，人们经常拥挤不堪。展览会开幕的第一天，卖品部的八套中国烧瓷茶具，不到两小时就卖出了七套。家庭主妇们则细心地挑选草编提篮和美好的花边。
    中国手工艺品在英国的第一次展出，使英国人民对新中国有了更进一步的了解。他们非常希望同中国人民加强经济和文化的联系。一位名叫克朗普的工程师感动地说：“制造这些东西，要比制造原子弹好得多。我们应该向你们学习如何生活！”（附图片）
    观众对郎绍安的捏面表演特别感到兴趣
