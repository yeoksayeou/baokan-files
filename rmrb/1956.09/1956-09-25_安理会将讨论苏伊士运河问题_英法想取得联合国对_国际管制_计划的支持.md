Xinhua News Agency, September 24th. Following the formal request by the British and French governments, the President of the United Nations Security Council, Núñez, has announced that a Security Council meeting will be held on September 26th to discuss the Suez Canal issue.

In a joint letter submitted to the President of the Security Council on September 23rd, Britain and France suggested convening a Council meeting to discuss "the situation created by the Egyptian government's unilateral action to end the international operating regime of the Suez Canal, confirmed by the 1888 Suez Canal Convention." In a letter on September 22nd, Britain and France described Egypt's refusal to accept the "internationalization" of the canal as "a clear threat to international peace and security."

A British Foreign Office spokesman said on the same day that Britain and France submitted the Suez issue to the Security Council in order to gain UN support for the "Eighteen-Nation Proposal" stipulating "international control" of the Suez Canal as the basis for resolving the Suez issue.

U.S. government was not listed as participating in the request made by Britain and France to the Security Council. According to US news agencies, the US side originally planned not to take action to submit the issue to the United Nations until after the "User Association" was established at the ambassadorial-level meeting of the Eighteen Nations on October 1st. Therefore, Britain and France's decision to submit the issue to the Security Council now surprised the United States somewhat.

Agence France-Presse reported that British political figures believe that this action by Britain and France "restored the diplomatic initiative on the Suez issue that had recently been seized by the United States."

### 安理会将讨论苏伊士运河问题  英法想取得联合国对“国际管制”计划的支持

    安理会将讨论苏伊士运河问题
    英法想取得联合国对“国际管制”计划的支持
    新华社24日讯　在英法两国政府正式提出请求以后，联合国安全理事会主席努奈斯一波图翁多已经宣布要在9月26日召开安全理事会会议来讨论苏伊士运河问题。
    英法两国在9月23日联合提交安全理事会主席的信里建议召开理事会会议，讨论“埃及政府结束由1888年苏伊士运河公约确认的苏伊士运河国际经营制度的片面行动所造成的局势”。在9月22日的信件中，英法两国曾经把埃及拒绝接受运河“国际化”的行动说成是“对国际和平和安全的明显威胁”。
    英国外交部发言人同一天就这件事发表谈话说，英法两国把苏伊士问题提交安全理事会，是为了争取联合国支持规定“国际管制”苏伊士运河的“十八国建议”，作为解决苏伊士问题的基础。
    美国政府没有列名参加英法两国向安全理事会提出的请求。据美国通讯社报道，美国方面原来计划在10月1日召开十八国大使级会议成立“使用国协会”以前不采取把问题提交联合国的行动，因此，英法现在就决定把问题提交安全理事会，使美国感到有些意外。
    法新社消息说，英国政界人士认为英法两国的这个行动“恢复了在苏伊士问题上最近被美国夺去的外交主动权”。
