    Poetry Island - Bali
    Wu Shihuang
    Bali is a beautiful island east of Java, surrounded by azure seas. The island has towering, cone-shaped volcanoes whose peaks are often shrouded in white clouds, making for exceptionally beautiful scenery. It is known as the "Island of Poetry." Most of the island's inhabitants practice Hinduism, which is completely different from the predominantly Muslim population of other islands. They have built many beautifully carved towers and temples on the island, hence the name "Island of a Thousand Temples." Hindus hold cremations after death, which is a very grand ceremony. First, the corpse is placed on a bamboo tower and carried to the crematorium. Then, the corpse is taken down, moved to a bull-shaped coffin, and cremated. The ashes are scattered in the sea or turbulent currents to be carried away by the waves.
    The people of Bali are hardworking and intelligent. Long ago, they had a fairly complete irrigation system. The rice they produce each year is supplied in large quantities to other islands.
    As early as 1400 years ago, Bali had contact with China. According to the Book of Liang, the country of Poli sent envoys to China in 517 to promote trade between the two countries. During the Sui Dynasty (616) and the Tang Dynasty (630), envoys were sent to China again, indicating that there is a long history of friendship between the Chinese and Balinese people.
    The Balinese are very fond of art, and music, dance, and sculpture have become an indispensable part of their lives. Balinese sculptures are highly artistic and famous far and wide. Most people traveling to Indonesia buy them as souvenirs. Balinese music, like Javanese music, is "Gamelan." The so-called "Gamelan" is a percussion band mainly composed of gongs, drums, and "Gambang," with a sonorous tone and clear rhythm. Balinese "Gamelan" is more relaxed and lively, fresh and melodious, while Javanese "Gamelan" is known for its somber and subtle qualities. Balinese dance is the most famous of all Indonesian dances, and it is often performed abroad. Its artistic level has reached a very high standard. It is more popular with general audiences than the Javanese classical dance "Srimpi." Balinese dances are diverse, including classical dance, war dance, folk dance, and song and dance. The most famous of these is the "Legong Dance," which is a Balinese classical dance. The dancers wear brightly colored flower crowns, huge earrings, gorgeous costumes, and a long piece of cloth hanging straight down to their knees in front of their chests. They hold paper fans in their hands, their arms are outstretched, and their slender fingers tremble, looking like beautiful flowers. The story tells of a Balinese princess who was kidnapped by King Lasem of Java. The king forced her to marry him, but she refused. The king threatened to kill her father if she did not agree, but she still refused to give in. The king then led his troops to attack Bali, resulting in a fierce battle. In the end, the tyrannical king was destroyed in the battle. The "Baris Dance" is a war dance. The dancers hold spears, their heads held high, and their arms outstretched, expressing the heroic spirit of the Indonesian people. The "Kebyar Dance" is a solo dance in which the dancer sits on the ground, relying entirely on the movements of the waist, arms, and neck to express inner emotions. This dance was created by the famous Balinese actor Mario and has the graceful posture of the Legong Dance and the heroic power of the Baris Dance. The "Lion Dance" is similar to the Chinese lion dance, depicting the struggle between the lion and the witch Rangda. The lion symbolizes light and justice, while the witch symbolizes darkness and evil. When the lion leads a group of warriors armed with short swords to fight the witch, the witch uses magic to make the warriors dizzy and stab themselves in the chest with their short swords. The lion also uses magic to prevent them from being injured. At this point, the plot reaches its climax. Soon the warriors wake up, annihilate the witch, and light finally triumphs over darkness, winning peace. These dances fully demonstrate the Indonesian people's firm opposition to oppressors and their love of peace.
    Now, the Indonesian Balinese song and dance troupe has come to visit our country. Let us warmly welcome them and wish them a successful performance.

    诗之岛——峇厘
    吴世璜
    峇厘是爪哇东部一个美丽的岛屿，四周被蔚蓝色的海洋环抱着，岛上有高矗入云的圆椎形火山，山峰经常被白云笼罩着，风景异常优美，素有“诗之岛”之称。岛上居民大部分信仰印度教，这是与其他岛屿大部分居民信仰伊斯兰教的情况完全不同的，他们在岛上建造了许多有着美丽的雕刻的塔和庙宇，故又有“千庙之岛”之称。印度教徒死后举行火葬，这是一个非常隆重的仪式，先将尸首放在竹塔上，抬往火葬场，然后将尸首取下，移至牛形的棺材内焚化，将骸灰散在大海或湍流中让波涛卷走。
    峇厘居民是勤劳和智慧的，在许久以前他们就有了相当完善的灌溉制度，每年出产的大米，大量供给其他岛屿之需。
    远在一千四百年前，峇厘就和中国发生了联系。据梁书婆利国（?矗览澹┐????517年遣使来中国促进两国之间的贸易，到了隋朝（616年）和唐朝（630年）又派使者来中国，从而可知中国人和峇厘人之间是有着悠久的友谊的。
    峇厘人非常喜爱艺术，音乐、舞蹈和雕刻已成为他们生活中不可缺少的一部分。峇厘雕刻，艺术水平很高，遐迩闻名，到印度尼西亚旅行的，大都购作纪念，峇厘音乐和爪哇的一样，都是“佳美兰”，所谓“佳美兰”是以锣、鼓和“甘梆”为主而组成的敲击乐队，音色铿锵，节拍显明。峇厘的“佳美兰”比较轻松活泼，清新悦耳，爪哇的“佳美兰”，则以沉郁含蓄著称。峇厘舞蹈在印度尼西亚各种舞蹈中最负盛名，经常出国表演，艺术水平已达到很高的水平，它比爪哇的古典舞“斯林比”，更受一般观众欢迎。峇厘舞蹈多种多样，有古典舞、战舞、民间舞和歌舞等，其中最著名的是“勒冈舞”，这是峇厘的古典舞，舞女头戴艳丽的花冠，耳挂巨大的耳环，身穿华丽的服装，胸前一片长布直垂膝前，手执纸扇，手臂平伸，纤指颤动，宛似花朵一样美丽。故事叙述一位峇厘公主被爪哇拉森王掳去，王逼她下嫁，她拒绝，王恫吓她若不答应将杀她父，她仍不屈服，王乃率兵进攻峇厘，发生激烈的战斗，结果这横蛮的国王在战斗中被消灭了。“巴力斯舞”是一种战舞，舞者手执长矛，头部挺直，两臂张开，表现出印度尼西亚人民的英勇气概。“格比阿尔舞”是单人舞，舞者坐在地上，全靠腰部、手臂和头颈的动作来表达内心的感情。这种舞是峇厘著名演员马里禾首创的，具有勒冈舞的婀娜姿态和巴力斯舞的豪迈雄劲。“舞狮”和中国的舞狮相似，描写狮子和女巫朗达的斗争，狮子象征光明、正义，女巫象征黑暗、邪恶。当狮子率领一群手执短剑的战士前去和女巫战斗时，女巫施展魔术，使战士神志昏迷将短剑向自己的胸部猛刺，狮子亦使出法术使其不致受伤，这时剧情达到了最高峰；不久战士苏醒过来，歼灭了女巫，光明终于战胜了黑暗，赢得了和平。这些舞蹈充分表现了印度尼西亚人民坚决反对压迫者和热爱和平。
    现在，印度尼西亚峇厘歌舞团已来我国访问，让我们表示热烈欢迎并祝演出成功。
