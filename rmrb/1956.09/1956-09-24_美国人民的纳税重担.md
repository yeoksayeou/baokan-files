    The Heavy Tax Burden of the American People
    How Much Tax is Paid Annually?
    As a result of the US government's increasing military expansion and war preparations over the years, taxes have been rising, causing unbearable hardship for the American people.
    The US has numerous domestic tax categories. Direct taxes include individual income tax, corporate income tax, capital tax, inheritance tax, property tax, wage tax, gift tax, etc. Indirect taxes mainly consist of various consumption taxes and sales taxes. Many taxes, such as individual income tax, are collected not only by the federal government but also by state and local governments. As for the various consumption taxes imposed on the broad masses of people, they are levied layer upon layer. For example, in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, a pack of cigarettes is taxed eight cents by the federal government, four cents by the state government, and three cents by the city government. According to official figures, for the fiscal year ending June 30 this year, each American had to pay an average of $575 in various taxes to the federal and local governments, $37 more than the previous fiscal year.
    Individual Income Tax Rife with Abuses
    According to a June issue of the American magazine "Newsweek," individual income tax currently accounts for 50% of the US federal government's revenue. The individual income tax is progressive, with a minimum tax rate of 20%. Single people with an annual income of less than $2,000, or families with an annual income of less than $4,000 (with no income for the wife), have to pay twenty cents in income tax to the federal government for every dollar of income. The rules for individual income tax are very complex, and ordinary people do not understand how to calculate it, for example, what kind of income must be taxed, under what circumstances can exemptions be applied for, etc. Therefore, they have to pay "experts" for help. According to "Newsweek," there are currently 300,000 "experts" in the United States who handle income tax matters for people, charging from $75 to $100 each time.
    On the surface, the wealthy should pay more taxes, but this is not the case. They use the tax rules riddled with abuses to evade taxes, for example, by establishing so-called family charitable or educational foundations. "Collier's" magazine once reported that one wealthy man, from 1943 to 1947, had a net income of $14 million, but due to the use of various tax evasion methods, he only paid a total of $80,000 in taxes, which was less than 0.6% of his total income.
    Unfair Burden
    Historically, the US government has placed the heavy burden of taxation on the shoulders of the American working people. According to statistics from the June issue of "Economic Notes," in 1955, the American working people paid $37.1 billion in taxes to the federal government, while the bourgeoisie only paid $29.7 billion (including corporate income tax). The US government has increased the tax burden on the working people by raising consumption taxes and wage taxes (which are a so-called social insurance tax levied specifically on workers). In 1955, consumption taxes increased fourfold compared to 1941, and wage taxes increased sixfold.
    Borrowing Money to Pay Taxes
    Since Eisenhower came to power, he has promised the American people tax cuts every year, but in fact, taxes have only increased. According to "U.S. News & World Report," this year's federal budget is $67.1 billion, of which $34.4 billion is from individual income tax, $11.3 billion is from consumption taxes, and only $21.4 billion is from corporate income tax.
    A "Wall Street Journal" reporter interviewed bankers, loan company employees, and pawnshop brokers in major cities across the country in May, proving that the situation of American people borrowing money to pay taxes is serious. The newspaper said that many people have to pawn their wedding rings, watches, televisions, irons, etc., to get money to pay taxes. It pointed out that the increasing number of people using pawns or borrowing money to pay taxes is the result of the increasingly heavy tax burden on the American people.

    美国人民的纳税重担
    一年纳多少税
    美国政府历年扩军备战的结果，赋税日益增加，已使美国人民不胜其苦。
    美国的国内赋税名目繁多，直接税包括个人所得税、公司利得税、资本税、遗产税、财产税、工资税、赠送税等等，间接税主要是各种消费税和贩卖税。许多种税，例如个人所得税，不仅联邦政府征收，州政府和地方政府也要征收。至于加到广大人民身上的各种消费税，更是层层抽征。例如，在阿拉巴马州德斯卡鲁萨城，一包香烟，联邦政府抽税八分，州政府抽四分，市政府抽三分。根据官方发表数字，到今年6月30日为止的这个财政年度，每个美国人平均要向联邦政府和地方政府缴纳各种税款达五百七十五美元，比上一财政年度还多三十七美元。
    弊端百出的个人所得税
    据6月份一期美国“新闻周刊”报道，目前美国联邦政府的收入50％来自个人所得税。个人所得税是累进的，征税率最低点是20％。每年收入在二千美元以下的单身汉，或者岁入四千美元以下的家庭（妻子没有收入），在每一美元收入中，联邦政府要抽二角钱所得税、个人所得税的税则很复杂，普通人都不懂怎样计算，譬如那一种收入必须纳税，什么情况下可申请豁免……。因此，还得出钱找“专家”帮助。据美国“新闻周刊”说，目前在美国就有三十万个代人办理所得税事务的“专家”，每次收费从七十五美元至一百美元。
    表面看来，富豪们应多交税，其实不然，他们利用弊端百出的税则进行逃税，譬如用成立所谓家庭慈善事业或教育事业基金委员会的办法来逃税。“柯里尔”杂志曾经报道，有一个大富豪，从1943年到1947年的五年中，他的纯收入是一千四百万美元，但是由于利用各种逃税的方法，结果一共只付了八万美元税款，还不到全部收入的0.6％。
    不公平的负担
    历来美国政府把赋税重担放在美国劳动人民的肩上。据6月份的美国“经济札记”统计，1955年，美国劳动人民向联邦政府纳税三百七十一亿美元，而资产阶级仅纳税款二百九十七亿美元（包括公司所得税在内）。美国政府通过提高消费税和工资税（这是一种专向工人征收所谓社会保险的税）的办法，来加重劳动人民税务负担。1955年，消费税就比1941年增加四倍，工资税增加了六倍。
    借钱纳税
    艾森豪威尔自从上台以来，年年答应美国人民减税，事实上赋税有增无已。据“美国新闻与世界报道”说，今年联邦预算六百七十一亿美元，这里面个人所得税为三百四十四亿美元，消费税为一百一十三亿美元，而公司所得税才二百一十四亿美元。
    “华尔街日报”的记者在五月间访问了全国各大城市的银行家、贷款公司职员和当铺经纪人，证明目前美国人民借钱纳税的情况严重。这家报纸说，许多人为了纳税，不得不把结婚戒指、手表、电视机、熨斗等到当铺换钱。它指出，用当东西或借钱来纳税的人越来越多，是由于美国人民赋税的负担越来越重的结果。　（林）
