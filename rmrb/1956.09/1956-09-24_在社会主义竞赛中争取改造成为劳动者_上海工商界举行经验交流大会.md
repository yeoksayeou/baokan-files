Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 22nd—The industrial and commercial circles of Shanghai held a city-wide socialist competition experience exchange conference yesterday. This is the first grand gathering held by Shanghai industrialists and businessmen after the complete public-private partnership of enterprises, in order to further transform themselves into laborers. More than two thousand industrialists and businessmen participated in the conference. Representatives from ten industrial sectors, including electrical equipment, glass, and enamel, and eleven private individuals, including the director of the China United Dyestuff Factory and the director of the Qian Yuan Feng Coal Store, introduced their experiences, insights, and plans for participating in the competition. Responsible persons from the Eighth Office of the Shanghai Municipal People's Committee and the Vice Chairman of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions attended the meeting to offer their congratulations.

More than 80,000 capitalists and capitalist agents in Shanghai have already assumed positions such as managers, factory directors, and engineers in joint public-private enterprises, many in roles they were familiar with before. According to Hu Juewen, Deputy Director of the Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce, more than 45,000 of them have joined the socialist competition alongside workers. In practical work and socialist competition, many have received beneficial training. More than 4,000 private personnel from joint venture enterprises have received awards in the competition or have been recognized as advanced producers or advanced workers in their enterprises. Some have even attended the National Advanced Producers Representative Conference held in Beijing this year.

Many people in Shanghai's industrial and commercial circles possess production technology and business experience, among whom seven or eight thousand have specialized skills and experience. After the public-private partnership of enterprises, they have been able to leverage their strengths with the support of the government and workers. Zhang Zhongkang, the private deputy director of the Dawei Electric Motor Factory, successfully trial-produced a hot-air blower that enables silk printing and dyeing to dry quickly, solving a quick-drying problem that had not been resolved for many years in China's silk printing and dyeing industry. Zhou Bailing, a private engineer and head of the production technology section of the Mingxing Household Chemical Products Factory, proposed a counter-current washing method in the competition, reducing the glycerin content of soap base from the original 0.5% to 0.2%, increasing glycerin yield, and lowering costs. This method is now being promoted nationwide. Guo Linshuang, the private manager of Yong'an Company, actively learned the management methods of state-owned stores and improved business management with the workers after the enterprise launched the competition, enabling the long-term loss-making enterprise to achieve a surplus. As a result, he won a third-class prize in the second quarter's socialist competition.

In participating in practical work and socialist competition, many industrialists and businessmen have also improved their ideological understanding and changed their management styles and working methods. He Dezai, the general manager of Guanghua Dyeing and Weaving Factory, had never been to the furnace room since he opened the factory. After the factory launched the competition, he also went to the furnace room to understand the workers' working conditions and took the initiative to improve working conditions. Seeing that the workers had achieved results in saving coal, he also gathered the private personnel in the factory to organize a "report good news team" to beat gongs and drums to report good news to the workers. The private personnel of Zhengchang New Rice Store carried rice to the lane entrances to set up stalls for supply during the high tide season when water accumulated in front of the store, earning praise from customers. In the past, many private personnel regarded technology as a secret and were very conservative. In the competition, they disclosed their technology or exchanged experiences with each other, improving the production of their enterprises.

    在社会主义竞赛中争取改造成为劳动者
    上海工商界举行经验交流大会
    新华社上海22日电　上海市工商界昨天举行了全市性的社会主义竞赛经验交流大会。这是上海工商业者在企业全部公私合营后，为了进一步改造自己成为劳动者而举行的第一次盛会，在这次大会上，有两千多个工商业者参加。电工器材、玻璃、搪瓷等十个工业行业的代表和中联染料厂厂长、钱源丰煤炭店店主任等十一个私方人员介绍了参加竞赛的经验、体会和打算。上海市人民委员会第八办公室负责人和上海市工会联合会副主席都到会祝贺。
    上海市八万多资本家和资本家代理人都已经在公私合营企业中担任了经理、厂长、工程师和许多他们原来熟悉的职务。据上海市工商业联合会副主任委员胡厥文说，他们中有四万五千多人已经同职工一道参加了社会主义竞赛。在实际工作和社会主义竞赛中，许多人得到了有益的锻炼。四千多合营企业的私方人员在竞赛中获得了奖励，或者在企业中被评为先进生产者或先进工作者。有的人还列席了今年在北京举行的全国先进生产者代表会议。
    上海的工商界中许多人有生产技术和业务经验，其中有七、八千人具有专门技术和经验。企业公私合营后，他们在政府和职工的支持下，发挥了自己的特长。大威电机厂私方副厂长张忠康，试制成功了使丝绸印染快干的热吹风机，解决了我国丝绸印染工业多年没有解决的快干问题。明星家用化学品制造厂私方工程师兼生产技术科长周百龄，在竞赛中创议逆流洗涤法，使皂基甘油含量从原来的0.5％降低到0.2％，提高了甘油出油率，降低了成本，目前这一方法已在全国推广。永安公司私方经理郭琳爽在企业开展竞赛后，和职工一起积极学习国营商店的经营方法，改善经营管理，使长期亏损的企业获得盈余，他因而在第二季度的社会主义竞赛中获得了三等奖。
    在参加实际工作和社会主义竞赛中，许多工商业者还提高了思想认识，改变了经营作风和工作方法。光华染织厂总经理贺得哉开厂以来从未到过炉子间，工厂开展竞赛后也到炉子间去了解工人的劳动情况，主动改善劳动条件，看到工人节约用煤有成绩，还集合厂内私方人员组织报喜队，敲锣打鼓向工人报喜。正昌新米店的私方人员在大潮汛来到，店门前积水期间，担米送到里弄口设摊供应，获得顾客的称赞。还有很多私方人员过去把技术当做秘密，十分保守，在竞赛中他们公开了自己的技术，或者互相交流经验，改进了企业的生产。
