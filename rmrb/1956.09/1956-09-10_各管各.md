Each Man for Himself
By Our Reporter Yu Ming

One evening, I met Wei Anmin, the director of the Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Plant, Yan Xingtang, the director of the Xiangshan Pyrite Mine, and Jing Dianmo, the Party Secretary of the Tongguanshan Copper Mine, at the Jianghuai Hostel in Hefei, Anhui Province. After only a few words, the conversation converged on a common problem:

Wei Anmin said: "In our area, iron ore is treated like a treasure. However, as far as we know, there are more than 100,000 tons of iron ore in Tongguanshan that are being treated as waste rock."

Jing Dianmo not only acknowledged this fact but also added, "The people from your mine estimate it to be 100,000 tons. But our people at the mine think that this number is underestimated; although everyone can't calculate the exact number, they feel that there is much more than that."

Yan Xingtang continued, "The loss of iron ore is even greater at our place. There are six million tons of iron ore in our old tunnels, but our task there is only to mine sulfur, not iron. After we extract the sulfur, we let the tunnels collapse, and the iron ore that we see is buried layer by layer underground." He paused, as if remembering something, and then continued, "There are four million tons of pyrite and four million tons of hematite in the newly opened tunnels. According to regulations, we can only mine pyrite, and the hematite will naturally be buried underground again."

At this point, everyone explained to me why they raised this issue. It turns out that the ore bodies along the Yangtze River in Anhui Province are mostly symbiotic with iron, sulfur, and copper. To mine iron ore, one must mine sulfur ore, and to mine copper ore, one must mine iron ore and sulfur ore at the same time. However, our current mining ignores their symbiotic characteristics. Those who mine copper only mine the copper ore layer, and the iron ore layers above and below are treated as waste rock. Those who mine pyrite only mine the pyrite side, and if that side happens to be iron ore, it cannot be mined because it is not their task.

At this time, Yan Xingtang said: "People shout against waste all day long, but this is the biggest waste!"

A comrade from a drilling team testified: "It costs seventy yuan to drill one meter of ore layer, but because of separate mining, even if those who mine one kind of ore drill into another kind of ore, they do not record it. When mining another kind of ore later, they have to repeat the drilling, which is a great waste. As for seeing the ore, but letting it be buried again because it is not their task to mine that ore, the loss is even more difficult to estimate. Because mining already mined and chaotic ore layers is many times more difficult than opening a new mine!"

I asked: "Then how can we avoid waste?"

Wei Anmin immediately said: "As long as the nearby mines implement comprehensive mining and separate supply, it will be fine."

Another comrade next to me said: "In fact, the method of comprehensive mining was implemented before. The current phenomenon is a problem caused by the implementation of separate mining in recent years."

I asked again: "Then why not implement the method of comprehensive mining?"

At this time, everyone said that they had raised this method to the higher-level leading organs, but it has not been resolved. The Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Plant belongs to the Iron and Steel Bureau of the former Ministry of Heavy Industry, and the Iron and Steel Bureau only requires the Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Plant to complete the iron smelting task. The Tongguanshan Copper Mine belongs to the Nonferrous Metals Bureau of the former Ministry of Heavy Industry, and the Nonferrous Metals Bureau only requires the Tongguanshan Mine to complete the copper production task. The Xiangshan Pyrite Mine belongs to the Chemical Industry Bureau of the former Ministry of Heavy Industry, and the Chemical Industry Bureau only requires the Xiangshan Mine to complete the sulfur production task. Because each is under different jurisdiction and has different tasks, this problem cannot be solved by the lower levels without the central leadership organs resolving it. They are just anxious and have no way to solve it.

    本报记者　于明
    一天傍晚，我在安徽省合肥市的江淮旅社里，遇到马鞍山铁厂的厂长魏安民、向山硫铁矿矿长晏兴堂和铜官山铜矿的党委书记荆典谟。大家谈了不多几句话，就把话锋集中到一个共同的问题上来：
    魏安民说：“在我们那儿，铁矿被当作宝贝；但是，据我们知道，在铜官山却有十万吨以上的铁矿石，被当作废石处理了。”
    荆典谟不但承认这个事实，而且还补充说：“你们矿上的人来估是十万吨。可是我们矿上的人，却认为这个数目估得太少了；大家虽然算不出确数，反正觉得不止那么多。”
    晏兴堂接着说：“在我们那里，铁矿损失更大。我们旧坑道里有六百万吨铁矿，而我们那里的任务却是只采硫，不采铁；我们把硫采了以后，就让坑道塌陷，那些看到的铁矿，就又一层层的埋到地下去了。”他停了一下，像是想起什么，又接着说：“新开的坑道中有四百万吨硫铁矿，还有四百万吨赤铁矿。按照规定，我们还是只能采硫铁矿，那些赤铁矿，自然又要被埋到地下去。”
    谈到这里，大家就给我解释，他们为什么要提这个问题。原来安徽省长江沿岸一带的矿体，大半是铁、硫和铜等共生的，要采铁矿就不能不采硫矿，要采铜矿就同时必须采铁矿和硫矿。可是，我们现在采矿却不顾它们共生的特点。采铜矿的，只采铜矿那一层，上边和下边的铁矿层，就当废石处理了；采硫铁矿的人，又只采硫铁矿的一边，至于那一边如果是铁矿，那也不能开采，因为那并不是他们的任务。
    这时，晏兴堂说：“人们整天喊反对浪费，其实这是最大的浪费！”
    一个钻探队的同志证明说：“钻探一公尺的矿层就要花费七十元，可是因为分别开采，采这种矿的，即使钻探到另一种矿，也不加记录；以后采另一种矿时，还得重复钻探，这就是一个很大的浪费。至于已经见到矿石，而只是因为自己的任务不是采这种矿石，又让它重埋到地下去，那种损失就更难估计了。因为开采已开采过的乱七八糟的矿层，比开新矿不知要困难多少倍哩！”
    我问：“那要怎样才能作到不浪费呢？”
    魏安民立刻就说：“只要附近几个矿实行综合开采、分别供应的办法就行了。”
    旁边另外一个同志说：“其实，在以前，就是实行综合开采的办法。现在这种现象，是最近几年来实行分别开采产生的毛病。”
    我又问：“那末，为什么不实行综合开采的办法？”
    这时大家就说，他们把这种办法向上级领导机关提出过，可是始终没有解决。马鞍山铁厂属前重工业部的钢铁局，钢铁局只要求马鞍山铁厂完成炼铁任务；铜官山铜矿属前重工业部有色金属局，有色金属局只要求铜官山矿完成产铜的任务；向山硫铁矿属前重工业部化学工业局，化学工业局则只要求向山矿完成硫的生产任务。因为各有所辖，各有任务，这个问题不从中央领导机关解决，下边是干着急而没有办法的。
