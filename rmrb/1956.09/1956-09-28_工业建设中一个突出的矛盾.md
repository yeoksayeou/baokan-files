A prominent contradiction in industrial construction: Solving the contradiction between technical and management levels lagging behind the needs of production development is a problem that urgently needs attention in promoting national industrialization.

Speech by Comrade Wu De, First Secretary of the Jilin Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China

The local representatives of Jilin Province attending the conference fully agree with the various reports and suggestions made by the Central Committee to this conference and guarantee to earnestly implement them in future work. I would like to talk about some issues regarding learning and mastering new technologies in industrial construction based on the spirit of the report.

Because our country's industry was backward in the past, and the new factories were built with the help of the Soviet Union, using the latest technology and at a relatively fast speed, and were put into production one after another, and the old enterprises are also undergoing technical updates in a planned manner where necessary and possible, therefore, the situation that our current technical level and management level lag behind the needs of production development has become a prominent contradiction from the perspective of our province. This is a problem that urgently needs attention in promoting national industrialization.

**Massively Train Technical Personnel, Oppose Shortsightedness and Conservatism in Technical Matters**

Modernized new technical equipment, technological procedures, and operating methods all require people to master them. If there is no group of cadres with corresponding scientific knowledge and cultural levels, and skilled workers (in most of the new factories in our province, low-level workers are replacing the work of high-level workers), it will be impossible to organize and manage production, and production safety and product quality will not be guaranteed, production cannot reach the design standards, and labor productivity cannot be improved. Since new units were put into production at the Fengman Hydropower Plant in 1953, there have been more than ten major accidents. The most serious was the No. 2 unit accident that occurred this year, which burned all the units and stopped work for two months for repairs. The Liaoyuan Central Shaft has never completed its production plan since it was put into production, and by the first half of this year, it only reached 52% of its design efficiency. Due to poor technical management, the underground roadways have collapsed seriously, and transportation conditions are extremely difficult. The workers composed a jingle saying: "The Central Shaft is modernized, you don't walk on two feet but crawl on all fours, in the past, pit props were pulled by carts, now they are implemented by manpower." During the trial production of the Jilin New China Sugar Factory, it was found that the variable speed device of the main liming tank was heating up. When repairing it, it should have been entered from the inlet, but due to lack of knowledge, worker Zhang Wenfu entered from the square opening, which led to his death from gas poisoning. Some complex equipment in the Jilin Electrode Factory still cannot be mastered proficiently; the factory's products still have defects such as cracks, bubbles, delamination, bending, and hollow heads. This all reflects that the existing technical level is low and we cannot master the new technology. Therefore, effective measures must be taken to quickly improve our technical level and continuously expand the ranks of technical forces.

The slogans "technology determines everything" and "cadres determine everything" are of great practical significance to us at present. In order to train a large number of technical personnel to meet the needs of the socialist cause, in addition to the planned training by national scientific research institutions and universities, the effective way to massively and rapidly grow technical forces is to train them on-site and from actual production.

At present, shortsightedness and conservatism on technical issues still need to be overcome. We have not been able to fully mobilize and give full play to the existing technical forces, and we have not been able to fully utilize all possible conditions to improve technical levels and grow technical forces. On the one hand, some of the original technical personnel have insufficient political progress, conservative technical thinking, and insufficient awareness and enthusiasm for learning advanced technology. On the other hand, some enterprise leaders have insufficient understanding of the Party's scientific work guidelines and technical policies, underestimate the role of the original technical personnel and their technical knowledge, do not pay enough attention to them, and have insufficient scientific knowledge and leadership experience themselves, and some work measures are also inappropriate, which restricts the creativity and initiative of technical personnel in researching problems, and hinders their enthusiasm and sense of responsibility for improving their technical level and cultivating new forces. Therefore, correctly implementing the Party's scientific work guidelines, the policy towards intellectuals, and technical policies, and conscientiously studying and summarizing the experience and lessons of leading technical learning, and promoting and improving the current upsurge of technical learning, is an important task in the current enterprise leadership work.

**Treat Construction Sites, Work Sites, and Workshops as Schools**

In recent years, some key construction units have accumulated some beneficial experiences in cultivating technical forces. These experiences show that as long as the leadership pays attention, the direction is correct, and the masses are well mobilized, it is possible to train a technical team and a certain reserve force in the process of building a factory that can initially master new technical equipment; the contradictions in technical issues can be gradually resolved.

New enterprises must establish the policy of "equal emphasis on factory construction, production preparation, and technical force training," proceed from the actual situation of the factory, foresee the needs of enterprise development, use a proactive spirit, implement the principle of combining theory and practice, and treat construction sites, work sites, and workshops as schools. The First Automobile Manufacturing Plant is based on this policy, first focusing on training leading cadres, especially transferred veteran cadres, so that they can quickly acquire the cultural, technical, and business foundation knowledge necessary for leading production and managing business; in the construction and installation stage, focusing on organizing the learning of engineering and technical cadres, so that they can become familiar with the technical data of the equipment and ensure the quality of installation; when entering the trial operation and adjustment production stage, the plant organized a "grand military training" for all workers, so that new workers could become familiar with the technological process and operating procedures. In the process of building the factory, from the arrival of equipment orders, unpacking and counting, installation, acceptance, cleaning, test run, adjustment of production to the start of production, seize every link, and organize personnel from each production position to conduct on-site learning, compare with technical data, study the structure and performance of the equipment, learn while doing, learn what is lacking, and consult experts at any time when there are difficult problems, and also conduct mock operations and preventive accident drills. After entering production, the goal is to strive for the production level to fully meet the design level. Further learning and mastering the technological process is an important link to make the equipment efficiency meet the design requirements within the expected time. On the basis of initially mastering the technological process, gradually achieve proficiency, be able to memorize and use it, and understand "why". In this way, linking with practice, learning materials, combining digesting materials with summarizing the practical experience of employees, continuously and repeatedly improving, so that cadres and employees have a certain preparation in technical theory and practical operation experience or management experience before putting into production, forming a team from top to bottom with preliminary capabilities in technical operation and business management, ensuring smooth production. However, this is only the first step in learning and mastering new technologies; it is also necessary to continue learning through the production process, continuously improve the level of technical theory, enrich production experience and management experience, so that they can independently solve problems that occur in production, and further strive to continuously improve production, carry out new product designs, use more complete processes, and catch up with the most advanced level of production technology of the same kind in the world.

**Actively Learn from Advanced Soviet Technology**

Learning from advanced Soviet technology is the most effective way for us to learn to master modern technology and grow technical forces. The primary issue in order to learn advanced Soviet technology is to establish a correct learning attitude, that is, to learn actively and honestly, and to oppose both a passive dependence attitude and a dogmatic attitude. Factories that have done well in this regard generally pay attention to organizing all relevant personnel to carefully study Soviet technical materials and organizational design materials, and systematically, comprehensively, and completely learn from Soviet experts through various methods in a planned manner, such as establishing expert studios, organizing experts to impart technology, designating cadres as apprentices of experts, and working with experts. They are good at combining the study of Soviet technology and design materials with the actual situation on the site, and are good at combining learning from advanced Soviet technology and implementing expert suggestions with the rationalization proposals of the masses and the advanced producer movement. They actively introduce the specific situation to Soviet experts, humbly consult and discuss problems with Soviet experts, so that the technical guidance of Soviet experts can be better combined with the actual situation and site conditions. This can both give play to the role of experts and learn the real ability to solve problems from experts. The Fengman Hydropower Installation Company combined the implementation of expert suggestions with giving play to the creativity of the masses, rapidly improved the technical level of employees, and grew a technical team for our country to install hydroelectric generators. This practice has been highly valued by Soviet experts. However, some factories and mines are not like this. They adopt a passive dependence attitude towards experts. In the process of building the factory, they did not actively and systematically learn from experts. When the factory was put into production, under the specific guidance of experts, production was normal and product quality was very good; once the experts left the factory, they could not master the technology themselves, and the production situation immediately deteriorated, producing defective products and causing technical accidents. Passive dependence thinking caused them to lose the good opportunity to learn to master advanced Soviet technology. On the other hand, some technical personnel and enterprise management cadres have also had dogmatic tendencies in learning advanced Soviet technology and advanced experience, divorced from reality and mechanically moved, which is also very harmful. For example, the Soviet automobile design was originally good, but under the geographical and climatic conditions in our country (some places in our country have a temperature of 40 degrees Celsius), the heat dissipation capacity of the radiator was insufficient. This situation should be reflected to the experts and researched and improved with their help. For example, the wood used for automobile carriage was originally designed to be fish scale pine. This kind of wood is abundant in the Soviet Union, but in China, this kind of wood is very scarce and expensive, and the output rate is only about 30%. It is said that it is completely possible to change to white pine or other wood that we do not lack, but some comrades think that as long as it is a Soviet design, no opinions can be raised. In fact, the characteristic of advanced Soviet technology is that it can adapt to the situation, solve practical problems, pay attention to practical results and savings. Many Soviet experts work in this spirit. For example, the water transmission channel in the Jilin Chemical Zone was originally designed to use steel pipes in order to prevent corrosion caused by water quality properties. Later, domestic technical personnel discovered that the local water quality properties were different and would not cause corrosion, and suggested changing to iron pipes. This suggestion was quickly approved and supported by Soviet experts. It can be seen from this that a dogmatic attitude will cause distortion of advanced technology and advanced experience, and failure to act according to the actual situation will inevitably cause waste and losses in construction and production. Of course, opposing dogmatism in learning does not mean that we can adopt an unscientific attitude towards scientific and technological issues, and it does not mean that we can rashly handle problems without careful study.

**Carry out Cultural and Technical Learning for Employees, Oppose Impatience and Laissez-faire**

In order to universally, massively, and rapidly improve the technical level and grow technical forces, we must provide correct, in-depth, and specific leadership to the mass cultural and technical learning of employees. In industrial enterprises in our province, 90% of employees have participated in spare-time cultural and technical learning. One of the characteristics of the advanced producer movement is that it has set off a mass upsurge of learning and mastering new technologies. However, in leading spare-time cultural and technical learning, there have also been some impatient and rash emotions, as well as laissez-faire phenomena lacking specific leadership. If these two tendencies are not corrected, learning will be "more haste, less speed," or it will lose leadership, and the result will inevitably be abandoned halfway. Therefore, we must emphasize the policy of active leadership and steady progress, and make comprehensive plans and specific arrangements for the spare-time cultural and technical learning of employees based on long-term needs and current actual possibilities, and correct the current phenomenon of greed for more and faster, and excessive burden on employees. On the one hand, we must actively and selectively run various spare-time cultural and technical schools (training classes) well, so that we can proceed step by step, from elementary to advanced, from comprehensive to professional, and conduct more systematic cultural and technical education for employees; on the other hand, we must vigorously organize various mass technical activities through socialist competition and the advanced producer movement, organize employees to teach and learn from each other, learn from each other's strengths and make up for weaknesses, and solve practical problems in production. Enterprise leaders should appropriately combine the organization and leadership of these two aspects of learning. Propose different learning content and learning requirements for different objects (such as new workers, general workers, skilled workers, returned students, and other types of technical personnel), and adopt organizational forms suitable for their respective characteristics, such as "package teaching and learning" and "master-apprentice contracts" among employees, "chain teaching method" among technical personnel, and various comprehensive and professional "technical research associations." In the advanced producer movement and socialist competition, combine labor and technology, "assault teams" and "rationalization proposal handling groups" to break through technical bottlenecks, and promote advanced experience, carry out rationalization proposals, and conduct technical performances, so that systematic technical education and mass technical learning activities can develop forward in a complementary manner under unified leadership, and gradually improve on the basis of popularization. In order to make the upsurge of employee technical learning last, it is also necessary to strengthen ideological work, improve the socialist consciousness of employees, and correctly solve problems such as wages, rewards, and spare-time arrangements, so as to promote employees to care about the improvement of their cultural and technical level from the perspective of material interests.

**Establish Contact with Scientific Research Institutions and Strengthen the Party's Leadership over Technical Work**

Establishing contact between production and construction units and scientific research institutions is also extremely important for helping enterprises solve key technical problems, improve the technical level of enterprises, and improve the quality of enterprise products. In the installation of the 506 iron tower, the Institute of Electrical and Mechanical Engineering of the Chinese Academy of Sciences helped solve complex technical problems such as the analysis of the bearing capacity of the soil and the physical properties of steel, which the construction site could not solve, so that the installation task was successfully completed and the quality of the project was guaranteed. Local industries and scientific research institutions in our province have also established contacts, and have also received much help in improving product quality. Establishing this kind of connection is also of great significance for promoting the combination of scientific research work with the reality of socialist construction.

Finally, we must improve the cadres' understanding of the importance of technology and strengthen the Party's leadership over technical work. Some cadres believe that "technical issues are trivial matters and do not require the Party to lead," or that "those who do not understand technology cannot lead." This view is wrong and is abandoning the Party's leadership over technical work. Of course, there is also another tendency. Some technical cadres believe that "with technology, you can go anywhere in the world, and you can eat even if you don't ask about politics," "Marxism-Leninism should be talked about in social science, but Marxism-Leninism is not needed in natural science." Some technical management cadres and enterprise administrative cadres are proud and complacent when they understand a little technology, thinking that "the Party does not understand technology and cannot lead technology," and saying that "laymen cannot lead experts," and refuse the Party's leadership in actual work. This is also wrong and must be seriously criticized, educated, and overcome. The existence of these problems in the Party's work in enterprises is obviously not conducive to uniting the entire technical force, improving technical levels, and cultivating technical talents, mobilizing and giving play to their positive factors, and serving socialism. Strengthening the Party's leadership over technical work mainly means enlightening and improving the initiative and enthusiasm of the broad masses of employees in learning technology through political work methods, and guiding technical personnel to approach and understand Marxism-Leninism through the practice of science and technology, and improve their political awareness. It is neither excessively interfering in those purely technical problems, nor empty political slogans divorced from reality. Cadres in the Party in industrial departments must study technical problems, be good at closely combining political work and technical work, and only in this way can the Party's leadership over technical work be truly strengthened.

The reports made by Comrades Liu Shaoqi and Zhou Enlai on behalf of the Party Central Committee to the conference have made us further realize the important position of the technological transformation of the national economy in our country's socialist construction. We must, in accordance with the instructions of the conference, strengthen the Party's leadership over technical work in industry, so that our newly built and rebuilt industrial and mining enterprises can learn to master the existing advanced technical equipment as soon as possible, and make use of the latest scientific achievements as much as possible, so as to further promote our industry to the track of modern technology.

    工业建设中一个突出的矛盾
    解决技术水平和管理水平落后于生产发展需要的矛盾，是推进国家工业化工作中亟需重视的一个问题。
    中共吉林省委员会第一书记　吴德同志的发言
    参加大会的吉林省地方代表，完全同意中央委员会向这次大会所提出的各项报告和建议，并保证在今后工作中认真执行。我想根据报告精神谈一谈关于在工业建设中学习和掌握新技术方面的一些问题。
    由于过去我国工业落后，而新建工厂是在苏联帮助下，采用最新技术，又用相当快的速度建设起来，陆续投入生产，旧有的企业在必要和可能条件下，也正有计划地进行技术更新，因而，目前我们的技术水平和管理水平落后于生产发展的需要的情况，从我省来看已成为一个突出的矛盾。这是在推进国家工业化工作中亟需重视的一个问题。
    要大量培养技术人材  反对技术问题上的近视和保守倾向
    现代化的新的技术设备、工艺规程和操作方法，都是需要人去掌握的，如果没有一批具备相应的科学知识和文化水平的干部，熟练技术的工人（我省新建工厂大多数的岗位上都是由低级工人代替高级工人的工作），便无法组织和管理生产，而生产安全和产品质量，就得不到保证，生产不能达到设计标准，劳动生产率就不能提高。丰满水电厂从一九五三年新机组投入生产以来，共发生重大事故十余次，最严重的是今年发生的二号机事故，烧毁了全部机组，停工修理两个月。辽源中央竖井，从投入生产以来，从未完成过生产计划，到今年上半年，才只达到设计效能的百分之五十二。井下巷道由于技术管理不善，倒塌情况严重，运输条件十分困难，工人编成顺口溜说：“中央竖井现代化，两脚不走四肢爬，过去坑木用车拉，现在实行人力化。”吉林新中国制糖厂在试生产中发现主加灰桶变速器发热，检修时本应从入口进去，因为缺乏知识，工人张文富却从方形口进去，以致被瓦斯熏死。吉林电极厂有些复杂的设备至今还不能熟练地掌握；该厂产品还存在着裂纹、起泡、分层、弯曲、空头等缺点。这都反映出现有的技术水平是低下的，我们还不能掌握新的技术。因此，必须采取有效措施，迅速提高我们的技术水平，不断扩大技术力量的队伍。
  “技术决定一切”和“干部决定一切”的口号，目前对于我们是有重大的现实意义的。为了大量培养技术人材以适应社会主义事业的需要，除了国家科学研究机关和大专学校有计划地培养以外，大量地、迅速地生长技术力量的有效办法，就是在现场、从实际生产中培养训练。
    目前在技术问题上的近视和保守倾向，仍然是需要继续加以克服的。我们还没有能够把现有的技术力量全部动员和充分发挥起来，还没有能够把足以提高技术水平和生长技术力量的一切可能条件，都充分利用起来。一方面一部分原有的技术人员，由于政治进步不够，技术思想保守，学习先进技术的自觉性和积极性不够。另方面，有些企业领导干部，对党的科学工作方针和技术政策领会不够，对原有技术人员及其技术知识的作用估计不足，重视不够，加以本身缺乏科学知识，领导经验不足，某些工作措施也不当，就束缚了技术人员研究问题的创造性和主动性，妨碍了他们对于提高自己的技术水平和培养新生力量的积极性和责任感。因此，正确地贯彻执行党的科学工作方针、对待知识分子的政策和技术政策，认真研究和总结领导技术学习的经验教训，把目前已经掀起的技术学习热潮推进和提高一步，是当前企业领导工作中的一项重要课题。
    把工地、现场、车间当成学校
    几年来，若干重点工程单位在培养技术力量方面，已经积累了一些有益的经验。这些经验说明：只要领导重视，方向对头，很好地发动群众，就可以在建厂过程中训练出能够初步掌握新的技术设备的技术队伍和一定的后备力量；技术问题上的矛盾，是有办法逐步得到解决的。
    新建企业要确立“建厂、生产准备和培训技术力量同时并重”的方针，从本厂的实际出发，预见到企业发展的需要，用积极主动精神，贯彻执行理论和实际相结合的原则，把工地、现场、车间当成学校。第一汽车制造厂就是根据这种方针，首先把领导骨干特别是转业的老干部作为培养训练的重点，使他们较快地获得领导生产和管理业务所必需的文化、技术和业务基础知识；在建筑、安装阶段，以组织工程技术干部的学习为重点，使他们熟悉了设备技术资料，保证了安装质量；进入试车调整生产时，组织了全厂工人“大练兵”，使新工人熟悉了工艺过程和操作规程。在建厂过程中，从设备订货的到达、开箱清点、安装、验收、清洗、试车、调整生产直到开工生产，抓紧每个环节，都把各生产岗位的人员分别组织起来，进行现场学习，对照技术资料，研究设备的结构和性能，边做边学，做啥学啥，缺啥补啥，有疑难问题随时向专家请教，还进行了假操作和预防性的事故演习。进入生产后，便以争取生产水平完全达到设计水平为目标。进一步学习掌握工艺规程，是使设备效能在预期时间达到设计要求的重要的一环，要在初步掌握工艺规程的基础上，逐步达到精通，作到会背会用，懂得“为什么”。这样，联系实际，学习资料，把消化资料同总结职工群众的实践经验结合起来，不断地反复提高，使干部和职工在投入生产以前，在技术理论方面和实际操作经验或管理经验方面，都有了一定的准备，形成一支从上到下都具有初步能力的技术操作和经营管理的队伍，保证了顺利进行生产。但是，这还仅仅是学习掌握新技术的第一步；还需要通过生产过程继续学习，不断提高技术理论水平，丰富生产经验和管理经验，作到能够独立地解决生产中发生的问题，并进一步争取作到不断改进生产，进行新的产品设计，运用更完善的工艺，赶上世界上同种类的生产技术的最先进的水平。
    积极地学习苏联先进技术
    学习苏联先进技术，是我们学会掌握现代技术、生长技术力量的最有效的办法，要想学到苏联先进技术，首要问题是树立正确的学习态度，就是要积极地、老老实实地学习，既要反对消极依赖态度，又要反对教条主义态度。在这方面做得好的厂子，一般都注意组织全体有关人员认真钻研苏联技术资料和组织设计资料，有计划地通过各种方式，系统地、全面地、成套地向苏联专家学习，如建立专家工作室，组织专家传授技术，指定干部作专家的徒弟，随专家工作等，善于把对苏联技术和设计资料的学习同现场的实际结合起来，善于把学习苏联先进技术、贯彻专家建议同群众的合理化建议，同先进生产者运动结合起来，主动地向苏联专家介绍具体情况，虚心地向苏联专家请教和商量问题，使苏联专家的技术指导能够更好地同实际情况、同现场条件结合起来，这样既能发挥专家的作用，又能从专家方面学到真正解决问题的本事。丰满水电安装公司把执行专家建议和发挥群众创造性结合起来，迅速提高了职工的技术水平，生长起我国安装水轮发电机的一支技术队伍，这种作法很受苏联专家重视。但是，有的厂矿却不是这样，他们对专家采取一种消极依赖的态度，在建厂过程中，他们没有积极地、系统地向专家学习，厂子投入生产时，在专家具体指导下，生产正常，产品质量很好；一旦专家离厂，自己就不能掌握技术，生产情况马上变坏，出废品，发生技术事故。消极依赖思想，使他们失去了学会掌握苏联先进技术的良好时机。另一方面，有些技术人员和企业管理干部，在学习苏联先进技术和先进经验时，也发生过教条主义的偏向，脱离实际，机械搬运，这也是十分有害的。比如，苏联的汽车设计原来是好的，但在我国的地理和气候条件下（我国有些地方有摄氏四十度的气温），就发生了散热器散热能力不够的情况。这种情况，应该反映给专家，在他们帮助下进行研究和改进。又比如汽车车箱用的木料，苏联原设计是鱼麟松，这种木材在苏联是不少的，但在中国这种木材却很少很贵，出品率只达百分之三十左右，据说是完全可以改用我们所不缺的白松一类的木料，但有些同志却认为只要是苏联的设计，就不能提出任何意见。其实，苏联先进技术的特点，就是它能够适应情况，解决实际问题，讲究实效和节约，许多苏联专家，都是本着这种精神工作的。比如吉林化工区的输水道，原设计采用钢管，目的是防止由于水质性能而引起的腐蚀，后来国内技术人员发现当地水质性能不同，不会引起腐蚀，建议改为铁管，这个建议很快就得到了苏联专家的赞同和支持。由此可见，教条主义态度会引起对先进技术和先进经验的歪曲，不按实际情况办事，必然造成建设和生产中的浪费和损失。当然，反对学习上的教条主义，决不是说我们就可以采取非科学的态度去对待科学技术问题，不是发现问题不经过周密研究就可以草率处理。
    开展职工的文化、技术学习  反对急躁情绪和放任自流现象
    为了普遍、大量、迅速地提高技术水平，生长技术力量，必须对职工的群众性的文化、技术学习加以正确的、深入具体的领导。在我省工业企业中，目前已有百分之九十的职工参加了业余的文化、技术学习。先进生产者运动的特点之一，就是掀起了群众性的学习和掌握新技术的热潮。但在领导业余文化、技术学习问题上，也曾发生一些要求过急的冒进情绪，还有缺乏具体领导的放任自流现象。如不纠正这两种偏向，学习就将“欲速不达”，或者失去领导，结果都不免半途而废。因此，必须强调积极领导、稳步前进的方针，根据长远需要和当前的实际可能，对职工业余文化、技术学习加以全面规划，具体安排，纠正当前存在着的贪多图快，职工负担过重的现象。一方面要积极地、有重点地把各种业余文化、技术学校（训练班）办好，以便循序渐进，从初级到高级，从综合到专业，向职工进行较系统的文化技术教育；另方面要通过社会主义竞赛和先进生产者运动，大力组织各种群众性的技术活动，组织职工互教互学，取长补短，解决生产中的实际问题。企业领导上应该把组织和领导这两方面的学习恰当地配合起来。分别不同的对象（如新工人、一般工人、熟练工人、回国留学生，以及其他各类技术人员等），提出不同的学习内容和学习要求，采取适合他们各自的特点的组织形式，如职工中的“包教包学”、“师徒合同”，技术人员中的“连锁传授法”，及各种综合性、专业性的“技术研究会”，在先进生产者运动和社会主义竞赛中的劳技结合，突破技术关键的“突击小组”、“合理化建议处理小组”以及推广先进经验、开展合理化建议、进行技术表演等等，从而使系统的技术教育和群众性的技术学习活动，在统一领导之下相辅相成地向前发展，在普及的基础上逐步提高。为了使职工技术学习热潮能够持久地坚持下去，还必须加强思想工作，提高职工的社会主义觉悟，还应该正确解决工资、奖励、业余时间安排等问题，促使职工从物质利益上关心自己的文化技术水平的提高。
    同科学研究机关建立联系  加强党对技术工作的领导
    建立生产建设单位和科学研究机关的联系，这对于帮助企业解决技术关键问题，提高企业技术水平，改进企业产品质量，也有极重要的作用。在安装五○六铁塔的工程中，中国科学院机电研究所就帮助解决了工地所不能解决的地耐力、钢材物理性能的化验分析等复杂的技术问题，使安装任务顺利完成，并且保证了工程的质量。我省地方工业和科学研究机关也建立了联系，在改进产品质量方面，也得到许多帮助。而建立这种联系，对于促进科学研究工作同社会主义建设的实际相结合，也是有重要的意义的。
    最后，必须提高干部对技术重要性的认识，加强党对技术工作的领导。有些干部认为“技术问题是小事，用不着党去领导”，或者认为“不懂技术，不能领导”，这种看法是错误的，是放弃党对技术工作的领导。当然另外也有这样的一种倾向，一部分技术干部，认为“有了技术可以走遍天下，不问政治也可以吃饭”，“社会科学上要讲马列主义，自然科学上用不着马列主义”，也有一些技术管理干部和企业行政干部，懂得一点技术就骄傲自满，认为“党不懂技术，就不能领导技术”，说“外行领导不了内行”，在实际工作中拒绝党的领导。这也是错误的，必须严肃地加以批判、教育和克服。企业党的工作中存在着这些问题，显然不利于团结全体技术力量，提高技术水平和培养技术人材，动员和发挥他们的积极因素，为社会主义服务的。加强党对技术工作的领导，主要是通过政治工作的方法，去启发和提高广大职工学习技术的自觉性和积极性，引导技术人员通过科学技术的实践接近和领会马克思列宁主义，提高政治觉悟。既不是过多的去干涉那些纯属技术性质的问题，也不是脱离实际的空洞的政治号召，党在工业部门中的干部必须钻研技术问题，善于把政治工作和技术工作密切地结合起来，只有这样才能真正加强党对技术工作的领导。
    刘少奇同志和周恩来同志代表党中央向大会所作的报告，使我们进一步地认识了国民经济的技术改造工作在我国社会主义建设中的重要地位。我们一定要本着大会的指示，加强党对工业中技术工作的领导，以便使我们新建和改建的工矿企业，都能够尽快地学会掌握现有的先进技术设备，并尽可能地利用最新的科学成就，以便进一步把我们的工业推进到现代化技术的轨道上。
