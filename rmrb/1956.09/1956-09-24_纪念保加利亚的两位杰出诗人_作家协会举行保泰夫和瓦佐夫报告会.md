Xinhua News Agency, September 23rd. The Chinese Writers Association held a report meeting in Beijing today to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the death of the outstanding Bulgarian poet Hristo Botev and the 35th anniversary of the death of Ivan Vazov.

The report meeting was presided over by the poet Xiao San.

Zhang Tiexian, Deputy Director of the Beijing Library, reported on the life and creative activities of Botev and Vazov at the meeting.

Zhang Tiexian said: Botev was born in 1848, during the height of the Bulgarian national liberation movement. After 1874, he became a leader of the national liberation movement. During his fifty years of creative activity, Vazov wrote many poems, novels, and plays. His representative work, the internationally acclaimed novel "Under the Yoke," truthfully reflects the revolutionary struggle of the Bulgarian people in the 19th century.

The spirit of Botev and Vazov, who fought for the people's revolutionary cause throughout their lives, is forever worthy of respect and study by future generations.

The Bulgarian writer Rozov, who is in Beijing, also attended and spoke. He said that he was excited to be able to participate in the Chinese people's gathering to commemorate these two poets. Soon, the Bulgarian people will also commemorate the 20th anniversary of the death of the great Chinese writer Lu Xun. He said: We are all proud because both China and Bulgaria have given birth to such great figures who serve the happiness of mankind, culture, and the great friendship between nations.

Then, actors recited famous poems by Botev and Vazov, and the Bulgarian film "Under Oppression," adapted from Vazov's famous work "Under the Yoke," was screened.

More than 300 people from all walks of life in Beijing attended the report meeting.

    据新华社23日讯　中国作家协会今天在北京举行纪念保加利亚杰出的诗人保泰夫逝世八十周年、瓦佐夫逝世三十五周年报告会。
    报告会由诗人萧三主持。
    北京图书馆副馆长张铁弦在会上报告了保泰夫、瓦佐夫的生平和创作生活。
    张铁弦说：保泰夫生于1848年，正是保加利亚民族解放运动高涨的年代，1874年之后，他就成为民族解放运动的领袖。瓦佐夫在他五十年的创作活动期间，写了许多诗歌、小说和剧本。他的代表作之一、博得国际声誉的小说“轭下”，真实地反映了十九世纪保加利亚人民的革命斗争。
    保泰夫和瓦佐夫一生为人民革命事业而奋斗的精神，永远值得后一代人崇敬和学习。
    在北京的保加利亚作家罗热夫也到会讲话。他说，他以能够参加中国人民纪念这两位诗人的集会而感到兴奋。不久以后，保加利亚人民也将要纪念中国伟大作家鲁迅逝世二十周年。他说：我们都感到骄傲，因为中国和保加利亚都诞生了这样一些为人类幸福、文化和民族之间的伟大友谊而服务的伟人。
    接着由话剧演员朗诵了保泰夫和瓦佐夫的名诗，并且放映了根据瓦佐夫名著“轭下”改编的保加利亚电影“在压迫下”。
    参加报告会的有北京各界人士三百多人。
