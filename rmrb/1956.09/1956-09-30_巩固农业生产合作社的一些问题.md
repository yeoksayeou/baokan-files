Comrade Zhou Xiaozhou, First Secretary of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, spoke:
    I fully agree with and support the political report made by Comrade Liu Shaoqi on behalf of the Party Central Committee, the report by Comrade Zhou Enlai on the proposal for the Second Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy, and the report by Comrade Deng Xiaoping on the revision of the Party Constitution. Now I would like to express a few opinions on some issues concerning the consolidation of agricultural production cooperatives.

    Since last November, Hunan Province has resolutely implemented the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee on the issue of agricultural cooperativization. This spring, we basically achieved the primary form of cooperativization, and recently we will basically achieve the advanced form of cooperativization. This year, the scale of agricultural production and the enthusiasm of the masses have exceeded any previous year. Agricultural cooperatives in disaster-stricken areas have created more methods and demonstrated greater ability in combating drought and providing disaster relief than individual farmers in the past, and have achieved greater results. The severe bankruptcies of poor farmers in the past during the lean season or when encountering natural disasters are now basically non-existent. Encouraged by the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) for 1956-1967 proposed by the Central Government, and relying on the active efforts of the masses, we will further develop various production undertakings in Hunan and make greater contributions to the great socialist industrialization of the motherland. At the same time, we are also soberly aware that because the cooperativization movement has progressed rapidly and practical experience is insufficient, there are indeed many shortcomings and problems in our work. These problems are concentrated in the fact that about 20 percent of the agricultural cooperatives are not well-managed or have reduced production, and the income of some members has not increased much or has decreased compared with before joining the cooperative, which has led to some doubts among a small number of people about the collective production of agricultural cooperatives. These problems must be solved quickly so that the cooperatives can fully consolidate their victory and continue to move forward.

    Too Much Emphasis on Unified Management Should Be Avoided
    After cooperativization, collective management was implemented, and the system of fixed quotas and piecework was tested and continuously improved. The broad masses of farmers have made great achievements in water conservancy, soil improvement, fertilizer accumulation, drought resistance, and disaster relief. Last winter, more than 5 billion dan of fertilizer was accumulated, more than double the previous year. Labor utilization and labor efficiency have been greatly improved. In the past, male laborers in the Caotang Agricultural Cooperative in Changsha County could transplant 1.5 mu of rice seedlings in one workday, with 5,000 seedlings per mu. Now, with intensive planting, they can still transplant 1.5 mu in one workday, but with 8,000 seedlings per mu. Last year, during the harvest season, each person could thresh 500 jin of rice per day. This year, four people can thresh a total of 2,500 jin per day. This year, most areas of Hunan have had no rain for 70 consecutive days, but the agricultural cooperatives have dispatched a total of one million waterwheels, irrigating with river water in an organized and planned manner. In many places, simple old-fashioned waterwheels were used to lift river water over the mountains, saving the seedlings and reducing the disaster. The understanding of the disaster situation and the relief of disaster victims have also been easier to grasp and carried out more quickly and specifically because of the cooperatives. Without the organizational strength of the cooperatives, the losses from the drought in Hunan this year would have been much more severe. However, on the other hand, we have insufficient experience in running large numbers of agricultural cooperatives well. Many cooperatives emphasize centralization too much, especially those advanced cooperatives that are being piloted, believing that since they are completely socialist cooperatives, "everything must be collectivized," even the members' scattered small amounts of ramie stalks, tea bushes, small orchards, small bamboo gardens, firewood mountains, etc., are all turned over to the cooperative. The Huangjin Cooperative in Taojiang County even included the members' drying yards and pumpkin sheds in the cooperative. Some agricultural cooperatives in Pingjiang County announced that "more than three trees must be included in the cooperative," and some farmers cut down one of their three trees. Because of the excessively small amount of private plots, generally only about 3 percent were left, making it difficult to obtain vegetables for self-consumption and feed for livestock. The cooperative's valuation of production materials such as cattle and farm tools when they were brought into the cooperative was too low, which caused dissatisfaction among some farmers and even led to serious phenomena of wasting and destroying production materials. In terms of management, even scattered household sideline occupations and decentralized handicrafts, such as making straw sandals, catching fish, catching shrimp, raising pigs, raising chickens, hairdressing, sewing, weaving, ferrying, and transportation, were all unified under the management of the cooperative. The cooperative also kept too tight a rein on the members' working hours, not arranging time for members to engage in household sideline occupations and grow vegetables, nor allowing them to work outside the cooperative. Some members complained: "After joining the cooperative, there is no freedom at all." Economic work and agricultural production cooperatives have not been well coordinated. The purchase of certain agricultural products has not received due attention. The purchase and sale price differences and regional price differences for some agricultural products are too large. For example, the purchase prices of rapeseed, tea oil, tung oil, and live pigs are generally too low, so farmers are not interested in producing these products. All the above points have aroused dissatisfaction among the masses. Because these shortcomings have not been overcome completely and in a timely manner, they have to some extent been detrimental to production, reduced the income of members, and affected the unity between members. The correct approach should be to allocate things that are not conducive to unified management but are suitable for household and individual management to members for free management; appropriately relax the size of private plots; maintain a constant balance in the allocation of labor to concentrate labor in busy farming seasons to meet needs, and to ensure that everyone has a way out in slack farming seasons; use labor rationally, without excessively increasing labor intensity, especially taking care of women and weak members; and adapt quota management to local conditions, the cooperative's situation, and the time, fully adapting to the differences in rural natural conditions and habits. Leadership over purchasing work must be strengthened to ensure that policies are correct, measures are appropriate, and prices are reasonable. Major agricultural and sideline products such as grain, oil, pigs, and certain cash crops should be planned roughly and reasonable prices should be set so that agricultural cooperatives know in advance and are interested in making arrangements. For the many scattered items that cannot be included in the plan, local commercial organizations should use temporary contracts to purchase them from agricultural cooperatives. This is beneficial to both national commerce and rural production.

    Grain Production and Diversified Management Are Both Important
    The majority of cooperatives in the province have achieved the goal of increasing production. This is because the cooperatives have implemented collective management, thereby having a unified production plan, improving the cultivation system, and promoting new production technologies and tools. The province has promoted 15 million mu of double-cropping rice this year, about three times that of last year. Many cooperatives have promoted advanced technologies such as deep plowing, intensive planting, and salt water seed selection. The learning and promotion of new technologies have increasingly aroused the interest of farmers. The improvement of old-fashioned farm tools and the invention and trial production of new farm tools have continued to emerge, such as double-shared wooden plows and rice threshers, which have greatly helped production. Many farmers have shown outstanding creativity and wisdom in this regard. However, some problems have also occurred in this area, mainly the tendency toward production simplification, focusing on grain production while neglecting diversified management. It is undeniable that Hunan must give primary attention to grain production. We have always focused on this in the past, and we must continue to do so in the future. However, at the same time, we must also see that cash crops and sideline production account for a large proportion of farmers' income in Hunan. Generally, it accounts for 40 to 50 percent of total income in mountainous areas, and about 30 percent in hilly and lake areas. In agricultural production, grain production should be the main focus while diversified management should be developed. This year, we initially focused on the grain production plan, and lacked specific plans and measures for diversified management. Due to the impact of grain shortages in the previous two years, farmers paid special attention to increasing grain production, and these shortcomings in our work further fueled this tendency toward simplification. For example, the Dongtinghong Agricultural Cooperative in Yuanjiang County was originally located in a concentrated ramie production area, and ramie income accounted for a large proportion of the cooperative's total agricultural income. However, in response to the call to "increase grain production" and strive for "1,000 jin of high yield," too much double-cropping rice was planted, concentrating labor and fertilizer on rice, resulting in a 20 percent reduction in ramie production. The Guanzhuang Agricultural Cooperative in Yuanling County is located in a famous tea-producing area. This year, due to improper labor arrangements, the tea picking season was delayed, the quality of tea decreased, and income was reduced by about 3,000 yuan compared to last year. There are many similar situations, so although some agricultural cooperatives have increased rice production, the production of cash crops and sideline occupations has decreased, and the total income has not increased after offsetting the increase and decrease. Secondly, there are also shortcomings of impatience and simplification in promoting advanced production technologies and tools. For example, "Aomori No. 5," an early japonica rice variety, was promoted on 200,000 mu in Hunan this year without being tested, and the harvest was generally not good, except for a few places where excellent results were achieved. Double-wheeled double-shared plows were also promoted too hastily, with inappropriately large orders, resulting in many troubles and waste. Too much double-cropping rice was also promoted in some cooperatives, resulting in tight labor, rough cultivation, and insufficient fertilizer. All of this has not only caused economic losses, but also caused ideological confusion among some people, and created doubts about the promotion of new technologies and experiences. This is another thing that is worth learning from. However, we must never lose our way, be passive, or shrink back because of this. As long as we truly make comprehensive plans when formulating production plans, give sufficient attention to agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, fisheries, and sideline occupations, properly arrange their interrelationships, prominently focus on grain, and develop diversified management, we will definitely be able to develop production in an all-round way. As long as we pay attention to the experience and habits of cash crop and sideline production in various places, discuss things well with the masses, and do not blindly change or stop the original planting and management, we will definitely be able to implement the production plan correctly. As long as we can be both active and cautious when promoting advanced production technologies and experiences, adopt methods that are appropriate to local conditions and cooperatives, demonstrate and persuade, and promote steadily, we will definitely be able to achieve good results.

    Adhere to Voluntary Mutual Benefit and Diligent Cooperative Management
    In the process of developing cooperatives, we have basically implemented the principle of voluntary mutual benefit, adopted an attitude of enlightenment and waiting without coercion towards middle peasants, and adhered to the principle of mutual benefit in handling the production materials of poor and middle peasants joining the cooperative and their economic relations with each other. The cooperative's distribution of production income is also basically handled in accordance with the principle of correctly combining national interests, collective interests, and individual interests, adhering to diligent cooperative management and distribution according to labor, so that 60 to 70 percent of the cooperative's income is distributed to members. Therefore, despite the reduction in production due to the drought this year and the reduction in production of a few cooperatives due to poor management, the vast majority of members still have increased their income compared to last year, and the accumulation of the cooperative has also increased. When agricultural cooperatives are still in the process of transitioning from small-scale farming to cooperative economy, and there are many difficulties in all aspects, diligent cooperative management is a very important thing. However, many cooperatives underestimate this, especially at the beginning of the cooperative's establishment, there is a kind of blind enthusiasm, wanting to start everything, and some like to show off and lack plans for using money. Some of our business departments also do not pay enough attention to this actual situation, and promote the rural postman system too tightly and too quickly, establish health stations, build stadiums, and promote the sale of books and newspapers too much, thereby increasing the burden on agricultural cooperatives, relatively reducing the income of members, and making the foundations of these undertakings themselves lack solid footing and difficult to consolidate. These are all shortcomings that should be overcome in the future.

    Two Issues in Leadership Work
    Finally, I would like to talk about two issues related to the leadership work of cooperatives. First: Since the cooperativization movement, the Party has carried out large-scale socialist ideological education work in rural areas, and has achieved great achievements. Now, what needs to be paid attention to is that ideological work must be more specific and in-depth. For example, one of the important reasons for the occurrence of many of the above-mentioned problems is that some grassroots and cooperative cadres are afraid of the spontaneous capitalist tendencies of farmers. Therefore, they are too concentrated and unified in production and management, and keep too tight a rein on the arrangement of working hours. They worry that "if too much is left, farmers will spontaneously take the capitalist road." This worry is superfluous, because the economic foundation of the entire society has changed. Members of agricultural cooperatives retaining a little land or engaging in certain scattered sideline projects, and carrying out certain necessary exchanges in the free market under the leadership of the national economy, can no longer take the road of capitalism. Therefore, there is nothing to be afraid of; on the contrary, conforming to this situation and giving members certain necessary free management and arrangements under the leadership of the cooperative will be more conducive to the development of the collective economy. Another important reason is the egalitarian and individualistic thinking of farmers, which leads to problems such as demanding equal distribution and reducing the quality of work. These problems require us to carry out in-depth and meticulous socialist ideological education and policy education in response to specific ideological situations. Only by carrying out this education can the specific work of consolidating cooperatives be carried out smoothly. Second: The occurrence of some of the above-mentioned shortcomings and problems is also due to the fact that our grassroots cadres do not have enough democratic style and are not good at following the mass line. For example, plowing up rapeseed and rush to plant double-cropping rice, the masses are opposed to it, but some cadres ignore the opposition of the masses and insist on doing so unilaterally in order to "complete the task." There are also such situations in promoting new farm tools or promoting certain new technologies. They do not consult with the masses, so they spoil good things. The masses have a relatively clear understanding that the scale of the cooperative should not be too large, but some cadres subjectively want to run large cooperatives, which makes the cooperative run poorly. The lack of a democratic style among grassroots cadres is related to the bureaucracy of higher-level leading organs. Our work is not deep and meticulous enough, and many problems have not been discovered and solved in time. Therefore, overcoming the bureaucracy of leading organs, improving the style of grassroots cadres, and improving the hundreds of thousands of cooperative cadres who have emerged from the mass movement and have initially learned to lead collective production are another important link in our consolidation of cooperatives.

  Hunan is currently in the midst of a high tide of advanced cooperativization. We plan to launch a mass movement to sum up experience, improve thinking, and rectify agricultural cooperatives throughout the province this fall and winter, combining top-down and bottom-up methods, extensively promoting democracy, and carrying out criticism and self-criticism, to advance the consolidation of agricultural cooperatives and agricultural production work.

    巩固农业生产合作社的一些问题
    中共湖南省委员会第一书记　周小舟同志的发言
    我完全同意和拥护刘少奇同志代表党中央委员会所作的政治报告、周恩来同志关于发展国民经济的第二个五年计划的建议的报告和邓小平同志关于修改党章的报告。现在我就关于巩固农业生产合作社的一些问题发表几点意见。
    去年十一月以来，湖南省坚决执行了党的六中全会关于农业合作化问题的决议，今年春季已经基本实现了初级形式的合作化，最近就将基本实现高级形式的合作化。今年农业生产的规模和广大群众的劳动热情都超过以往任何一年，受灾地区的农业社对抗旱和救灾，都比过去单干农民创造了更多的办法，发挥了更大的能力，收到了更大的效果。过去贫苦农民每逢青黄不接或者遭遇到自然灾害时候的严重破产情况，现在是基本上不再存在了。在中央提出的一九五六——一九六七年全国农业发展纲要（草案）的鼓舞之下，依靠群众的积极努力，我们将进一步发展湖南的各种生产事业，对于伟大祖国的社会主义工业化事业作出更大更多的贡献。同时，我们也清醒地看到：因为合作化运动进展很快，加以实际经验不够，所以在工作中确还存在着不少的缺点和问题，这些问题集中表现在约有百分之二十的农业社办得不好或者减产，一部分社员比入社前增加收入不多或者减少了收入，以致在一小部分人中间对农业社的集体生产发生了某些怀疑。必须迅速解决这些问题，合作社才能够全面巩固胜利，继续前进。
    不可太强调统一经营
    在合作化以后，实行了集体经营，试行和不断改进了定额包工制度，广大农民在兴修水利、改良土壤、增积肥料、抗旱救灾等方面，都创造了很大的成绩。去年冬季积肥五十多亿担，超过上年一倍以上。劳动利用率和劳动效率提高了很多。长沙县草塘农业社过去男劳动力在一个工作日插秧一点五亩，每亩插禾五千兜，现在实行了密植，每个工作日仍插一点五亩，但每亩插八千兜；去年在收割时打稻脱粒，每人每天能打五百斤，今年则四个人每天共打二千五百斤。今年湖南大部分地区一连七十天没有下雨，但农业社先后出动的水车共达百万架之多，有组织有计划地引用河水灌溉，在许多地方用简陋的旧式水车，使河水翻过了山岭，挽救了禾苗，减轻了灾害。对于灾情的了解和灾民的救济，也因为有了合作社而比较便于掌握，进行得更迅速，更具体。如果没有合作社的组织力量，今年湖南旱灾的损失一定会更加严重得多。但是，从另一方面检查，我们对于大批地办好农业合作社却是经验不足的。许多合作社太强调了集中的一面，特别是那些试办起来的高级社，以为既然是完全社会主义性质的合作社，“一切都要公有化”才行，连社员的一些零星小量的苎麻兜、茶兜、小果园、小竹园、茅柴山等等，也都归社。桃江县黄金社把社员的晒衣坪、南瓜棚也入了社。平江县有些农业社宣布“三棵树以上就入社”，有些农民就在自己的三棵树中砍掉了一棵。由于自留地过少，一般农业社只留下百分之三左右，以致自食菜蔬和家畜饲料发生困难。合作社对于耕牛、农具等生产资料入社时的折价压得过低，因此引起部分农民不满，甚至发生了一些糟踏、破坏生产资料的严重现象。在经营方面，连零星的家庭副业和分散的手工业，如打草鞋、捉鱼、捞虾、养猪、养鸡、理发、缝衣、编织、摆渡、运输等等，都统一归社经营。合作社对社员的劳动时间也卡得过紧，不安排社员经营家庭副业和种菜的时间，也不许他们到社外去劳动，某些社员反映：“入了社一点自由也没有了”。经济工作和农业社的生产没有配合得好，某些农产品的采购没有受到应有的重视，有一部分农产品的购销差价和地区差价过大，如菜籽、茶油、桐油、生猪等项收购价格一般偏低，以致农民对于这些产品的生产不感兴趣。以上几点都引起了群众的不满。这些缺点因为没有及时完全克服，结果就在一定程度上不利于生产，减少社员的收入，并且影响社员之间的团结。正确的做法，应该是将那些不利于统一经营而适宜于家庭和个人经营的东西，划归社员自由经营；对自留土地要适当放宽一些；对劳动力的调配要经常保持平衡，使农忙季节能集中使用，适应需要，农闲季节能各得其所，都有出路；对劳动力的使用要合理，不能过分地增加劳动强度，对妇女和体弱的社员尤其要注意照顾；对定额管理要因地因社因时制宜，充分地适应农村自然条件和习惯的差异。对采购工作必须加强领导，务使政策正确，措施恰当，价格合理。对主要农副产品如粮、油、猪和某些经济作物，应该分别订出大体的计划，并规定合理的价格，使农业社事先心中有数，并且感到兴趣，作好安排。对于不可能纳入计划的许多零星东西，应该由当地商业机关与农业社采用临时订立合同的办法来收购。这对于国家商业和农村生产都是有利的。
    粮食生产和多种经营都重要
    全省大多数的合作社达到了增产的目的。这是由于合作社实行了集体经营，因而有了统一的生产计划，改进了耕作制度，推广了新的生产技术和工具的结果。全省今年推广的双季稻一千五百万亩约等于去年的三倍。许多合作社推广了深耕、密植、盐水选种等先进技术。新技术的学习和推广已经愈来愈多地引起农民的兴趣，对旧式农具的改良和新式农具的发明、试制已经不断地出现，如双铧木犁、打稻机等，都对生产有很大的帮助。有不少农民在这方面表现了卓越的创造力和智慧。但是在这方面也曾发生了一些问题，主要是生产上的单一化倾向，抓住了粮食生产，忽视了多种经营。湖南对于粮食生产必须给予首要的注意，这是不容怀疑的。我们过去一贯抓紧了这一项，在今后仍须继续如此。但是，同时还必须看到，经济作物和副业生产在湖南农民收入中占有很大比重，山区一般占总收入的百分之四十至五十，丘陵区和湖区占百分之三十左右。在农业生产上应该是以粮食生产为主同时开展多种经营。今年我们开始只是着重地抓紧了粮食生产计划，对于多种经营缺少具体计划和措施。由于前两年一度粮食紧张的影响，农民特别注意对粮食的增产，再加上我们工作上的这些缺点，就更加助长了这种单一化的倾向。比如沅江县洞庭红农业社本来是处在苧麻集中产区，苧麻收益占全社农业总收入的比重很大，但是为了响应“增产粮食”的号召，争取“千斤丰产”，扩种双季稻太多，把劳力和肥料集中地用在稻谷方面，以致苧麻减产百分之二十。沅陵县官庄农业社是处在著名的产茶区，今年因为劳力安排不当，耽误了采茶季节，茶质降低，比去年减少收入三千元左右。类似这样的情况不少，所以有些农业社虽然稻谷增产，而经济作物和副业却减产，增减相抵，总收入并未增加。其次，在推广先进的生产技术和工具方面也有急躁和简单化的缺点。例如早粳“青森五号”，在湖南还没有经过试验，今年一下就推广二十万亩，除少数地方得到优良成绩外，收成一般不好。双轮双铧犁也因推行得过急，不适当地大批订货，以致产生许多麻烦和浪费。双季稻也因某些社推广太多，以致劳力紧张，耕作粗糙，肥料不够。凡此种种，不但造成了经济上的损失，并且在若干人们中间引起了思想上的混乱，对推行新的技术和经验发生怀疑。这是值得引为教训的又一件事。但是，我们决不应该因此迷失方向，消极退缩。只要我们在制订生产计划的时候，真正做到全面规划，对农、林、渔、牧、副业给予足够的注意，恰当地安排它们相互之间的关系，突出地抓好粮食，开展多种经营，就一定能够全面发展生产。只要我们注意各地经济作物和副业生产的经验和习惯，很好地和群众商量办事，不盲目改变或停止原有的种植和经营，就一定能够使生产计划正确实施。只要在推广先进生产技术和经验的时候能够做到既积极、又慎重，采取因地因社制宜的办法，示范说服，稳步推行，就一定能够获得良好的效果。
    坚持自愿互利和勤俭办社
    我们在发展合作社的过程中，基本上执行了自愿互利的方针，对于中农采取了启发、等待而不强迫的态度，对于贫农和中农入社的生产资料以及相互间经济关系的处理，坚持了互利原则。合作社对于生产收益的分配，也基本按照国家利益、集体利益和个人利益正确结合的原则来处理，坚持了勤俭办社，按劳取酬，使合作社收入的百分之六十至七十分配给社员。因此，尽管今年因旱灾减产并有少数的社因经营不善而减产，仍然有绝大多数社员比去年增加了收入，社内积蓄的底子也有所增厚。在农业社还是刚由小农经济转向合作经济，各个方面困难很多的时候，勤俭办社是十分要紧的事。但是，许多社对此却估计不够，特别在初建社时有一种盲目的热情，什么事都想兴办，而且有些爱讲排场，用钱缺少打算。我们有些事业部门对这个实际情况也注意不够，过紧过急地推行乡邮递员制度，设立保健站，建立体育场，过多地推销书报等等，因而加重了农业社的负担，相对地减少了社员收入，并且使这些事业的本身缺乏根基，难以巩固。这些都是应在今后注意克服的缺点。
    领导工作方面的两个问题
    最后，我想就有关合作社领导工作方面谈两个问题。第一：合作化运动以来，党在农村中进行了大规模的社会主义思想教育工作，已经取得了巨大的成就。现在需要注意的是必须使思想工作更加具体和深入。例如上述许多问题的发生，其重要原因之一是某些基层和社的干部害怕农民自发的资本主义倾向，因此在生产和经营上集中统一过多，劳动时间安排上卡得太死，他们耽心“留得多了，农民会自发走资本主义道路”。这种耽心是多余的，因为整个社会的经济基础已经改变了，农业社员自留一点田地或者经营某些零星副业项目，在国家经济领导下的自由市场进行某些必要的交换，决不可能再走到资本主义的道路上去，因此是没有什么可怕的；相反，顺应这种形势在合作社的领导之下给予社员某些必要的自由经营与安排，就会更有利于集体经济的发展。另一个重要原因是农民的平均主义和个人主义思想，由此发生要求平均分配、工作质量降低等问题。这些问题要求我们针对具体思想情况进行深入和细致的社会主义思想教育和政策教育，只有进行这种教育，巩固合作社的具体工作才可以顺利进行。第二：上述某些缺点和问题的发生，还由于我们基层干部民主作风不够，不善于走群众路线的原故。比如把油菜、席草犁掉来种双季稻，群众是反对的，某些干部却不顾群众的反对，片面地为“完成任务”硬要这样做。又如推广新式农具或者推广某些新技术，也有这种情况，不去和群众商量，因此把好事办坏。合作社的规模不能过大，群众是看得比较清楚的，某些干部则主观地要办大社，以致使社办得不好。基层干部的民主作风不够是与上级领导机关的官僚主义相关连的，我们的工作还不够深入细致，许多问题没有能够及时发现和解决，因此克服领导机关的官僚主义，改善基层干部的作风，把数十万从群众运动中涌现出来的已经初步学会领导集体生产的合作社干部加以提高，是我们巩固合作社的又一重要环节。
  目前湖南正处在高级形式的合作化高潮之中，我们准备在今年秋冬之间，在全省范围内采取上下结合、广泛发扬民主、开展批评和自我批评的方式，发动一次总结经验、提高思想、整顿农业社的群众运动，把农业合作社的巩固工作和农业生产工作推向前进。
