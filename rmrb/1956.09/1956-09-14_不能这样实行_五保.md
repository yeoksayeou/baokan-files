It is not acceptable to implement the "Five Guarantees" this way.

Guoxun

Hetou Agricultural Cooperative in Dashiqu District, Linhai County, Zhejiang Province, identified twenty households as "Five Guarantee" households. However, according to the actual situation, only seven households should be entitled to the "Five Guarantees." The remaining thirteen households are either generally difficult households with a large population and a small labor force, or households that have some means of support and are not in much difficulty. Strictly speaking, they do not meet the "Five Guarantees" conditions. Even for those seven households that should be entitled to the "Five Guarantees," some are still able to engage in some light labor, but the cooperative has not arranged for them in terms of production, only taking care of them in terms of living. Although some corrections have been made afterward, many problems still exist.

Qinglong Agricultural Cooperative in Desheng Township, Wuwei County, Anhui Province, has a young woman surnamed Dai who originally worked very well. Because her husband died and left her with a three-year-old child, the cooperative provides her with 1,950 jin of dried rice every year. From then on, she no longer goes to the fields to work. It is said that in this cooperative, all widows are included in the "Five Guarantees" scope. The cooperative director was quite proud when introducing this situation to others, as if they had correctly implemented the "Five Guarantees" policy.

Because those who should not be enjoying the "Five Guarantees" are being "guaranteed," and those who should be appropriately arranged for in production are being completely "guaranteed," the burden on the cooperative has increased, causing dissatisfaction among the members. Take the aforementioned Hetou Agricultural Cooperative as an example: before the correction, the annual subsidy of grain reached 13,800 jin, accounting for 5% of the cooperative's total output. The members said, "Those who shouldn't be guaranteed are being guaranteed, and the cooperative is just enough to support them!" In fact, this kind of deviation is not limited to this one cooperative.

Of course, some cooperatives have experienced another kind of deviation, failing to implement the "Five Guarantees" for households with no labor and no means of support at all, causing difficulties in the lives of these households.

How should the "Five Guarantees" policy be implemented correctly? First of all, it is necessary to clearly distinguish the boundary between "Five Guarantees" households and general socially difficult households. According to Article 3 of the "National Agricultural Development Program (Draft)" and Article 53 of the "Model Regulations for Advanced Agricultural Production Cooperatives," the target of the "Five Guarantees" should be cooperative members who lack labor or have completely lost their labor, and whose lives have no support, such as the elderly, weak, orphaned, widowed, disabled, and sick. As for those general socially difficult households with a small labor force, a large population, or insufficient income to maintain their lives due to temporary disasters or illnesses, the cooperative should arrange production to solve the problem, or provide appropriate subsidies, and the state can also provide relief, but they should not be collectively implemented with the "Five Guarantees." Even for "Five Guarantees" households, it is necessary to arrange for them to engage in some production within their capacity as much as possible, and not just simply take care of them in terms of living.

The "Five Guarantees" work is a complex and meticulous task, and it is necessary to earnestly implement the spirit of the policy. Infinitely expanding or inappropriately narrowing the scope of the "Five Guarantees" is not in line with the spirit of the "Five Guarantees" and is also a departure from the masses.

    不能这样实行“五保”
    国勋
    浙江临海县大石区河头农业社，确定了二十户“五保”户。但按实际情况，只有七户是应当享受“五保”的，其余十三户，有的是人口较多、劳力较少的一般困难户，有的是生活还有依靠，并没有多大困难的户，严格说，都不够“五保”条件。即使是那七户应当享受“五保”的社员，有些也还能从事些轻微劳动，但社里并没从生产上加以安排，只是从生活上照顾。这些以后虽作了些纠正，但还存在着不少问题。
    安徽无为县德胜乡青龙农业社，有一姓戴的青年妇女，本来劳动很好，因为她丈夫死了，留下一个三岁小孩，社里就每年供给她一千九百五十斤干稻子。从此，她再也不下田生产了。据说，这个社凡是寡妇，都被列入“五保”范围。社主任在向人介绍此一情况时，还颇为得意，似乎他们正确执行了“五保”政策。
    由于不应该享受“五保”的反而“保”了，应该从生产上加以适当安排的也完全“保”下来了。结果就增加了合作社的负担，引起了社员的不满。就拿前面所举的河头农业社来说，在未纠正前，一年补助的粮食就达一万三千八百斤之多，占到全社总产量的5％。社员们说：“不该保的也保，合作社光够养活他们了！”实际上发生这种偏差的不只这一个社。
    当然，也有些社发生了另外一种偏差，对于完全无劳力无依靠的户也不实行五保，使这些户的生活发生了困难。
    怎样执行“五保”政策才算是正确的呢？这里首先必须划清“五保”户和一般社会困难户的界限。根据“全国农业发展纲要（草案）”第三条及“高级农业生产合作社示范章程”第五十三条的规定，“五保”对象应该是缺乏劳动力或者完全丧失劳动力、生活没有依靠的老弱孤寡残疾的社员。至于那些家中劳力少、人口多或因暂时的灾、病收入不足维持生活的一般社会困难户，应该由社安排生产来解决，或给予适当的补贴，还可以由国家救济，而不应笼统地实行“五保”。就是对“五保”户也要尽可能适当安排些他们力所能及的生产，不要只是单纯从生活上照顾。
    “五保”工作是一项复杂细致的工作，一定要认真贯彻政策精神。把“五保”的范围无限扩大或不适当地缩小，都是不符合“五保”的精神，也是脱离群众的。
