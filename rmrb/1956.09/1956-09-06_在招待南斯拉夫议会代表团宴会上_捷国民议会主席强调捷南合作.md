Xinhua News Agency, Prague, September 5th: Czechoslovak National Assembly Chairman Fierlinger stated at a luncheon on September 4th honoring the Yugoslav parliamentary delegation that, in the current era of great changes in the world, it can be considered that the shared destiny of the Czech and Yugoslav nations is more firmly established.

Fierlinger said that Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia have already embarked on the path of building socialism. A frank exchange of views and sharing of experiences will certainly benefit both countries. The exchange of experiences should not be limited to visits between parliamentary delegations but should also be reflected in the enthusiastic mutual dispatch of various experts.

The head of the Yugoslav parliamentary delegation, Marinko, emphasized that Czech-Yugoslav relations are linked by past friendship and, in particular, by current common goals.

Speaking of the exchange of experiences, Marinko said that the people of Czechoslovakia possess strengths that arouse the interest of other countries and are beneficial to the common goal of socialism. He emphasized that practice increasingly proves that building socialism is an arduous and complex matter, and there is no standard model to follow. It must be carried out according to social conditions and historical development, as well as other factors.

Marinko also spoke of the experiences and difficulties in building socialism in Yugoslavia and the issue of economic self-management. He emphasized that Yugoslavia needs to learn from other countries because this is beneficial to the construction of socialism and mutual understanding.
