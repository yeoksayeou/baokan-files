Title: Mr. Lu Xun and Classical Opera

Mr. Lu Xun said in "Village Opera": "In the twenty years counting backwards, I only saw two Chinese operas. In the first ten years, I never watched them because I had no interest or opportunity. The two times were all in the last ten years, but I left before I could make anything of them."

The twenty years mentioned here, according to "Village Opera" written in October 1922, roughly correspond to 1902-1922. The two Chinese operas he watched in the latter ten years refer to Peking Opera, and the latter one, which he saw half a scene of, was Gong Yunfu's "Slippery Oil Mountain."

Mr. Lu Xun also said: "I do remember seeing very good opera in the countryside. After coming to Beijing, I went to the theater twice, perhaps influenced by those times... As for when I saw that good opera, it was really 'far, far away,' and I was probably only eleven or twelve years old at the time."

The good opera mentioned here is the village opera in Shaoxing.

What types of opera were performed in Shaoxing at that time? As far as I know, they were no more than: 1. Peking Opera "Water Route Troupes," 2. "Yanshan Troupes" from Xinchang and Shengxian counties, 3. The ancient "Gaoqiang Troupes" of Shaoxing, and 4. The most popular local "Luantan Troupes" of Shaoxing.

And that opera performed in the countryside near Mr. Lu Xun's grandmother's house, which he so captivatingly described, can be inferred to be a collaboration between "Yanshan Troupes" and "Luantan Troupes." Because the daytime opera had an old male lead who flipped eighty-four somersaults, and the nighttime opera had several shirtless people flipping for a while, which is martial arts that "Wenluantan" wouldn't do, only "Yanshan Troupes" could handle it. These troupes, because they were good at martial arts but not at literary arts, couldn't attract audiences, and later merged with "Wenluantan."

Mr. Lu Xun said: "However, my interest was not really in watching the somersaults. What I most wanted to see was a person covered in white cloth, holding a stick-like snake head in their hands, playing the snake spirit, and next was someone wearing yellow cloth and jumping like a tiger."

The jumping tiger mentioned here appears in many operas. What's special is that before the tiger jumps out, there is often a grey little ghost jumping around on the stage, which is the伥鬼 (chang gui) that "works for the tiger."

Is the snake spirit mentioned here Qing Snake and White Snake from "Legend of the White Snake"? No. This opera is called "Lost Embroidered Shoe," and it tells the story of a young girl being carried into a mountain cave by a snake spirit. A brave young man finds her lost embroidered shoe in the mountains, follows the trail, fights the snake spirit, and rescues her. It seems to be based on a fairy tale, and other opera genres don't seem to have this play.

Mr. Lu Xun said: "Suddenly, a red-shirted clown was tied to a pillar and whipped by a white-bearded man, and everyone cheered up and laughed again. That night, I thought this was really the best scene."

What opera did this scene, which Mr. Lu Xun thought was the best, come from?

In my opinion, this scene is from "Youyuan Diaoda" (Touring the Garden and Hanging Up to Beat), a single scene from the "Wenluantan" grand opera "Five Beauties Picture." The scene before it is called "Zhengchao" (Debating in Court), which is also a famous and good opera. "Zhengchao" depicts the fierce struggle between loyal ministers and treacherous officials in front of the emperor. As a result, the loyal minister fails and resigns in anger. This loyal minister is the white-bearded man mentioned by Mr. Lu Xun. When he returns home, he happens to encounter the son of that treacherous official, who, with an old servant, breaks into his garden, intending to forcibly take his daughter. National and family hatred make him furious. He captures the evil young man, hangs him up, and whips him relentlessly until the evil young man makes a vow and writes a confession - a letter of repentance.

The words in the confession are very clever:

	Evil Young Man: Snatching Jiaojiao,
	Old Ding: Starts trouble!
	Evil Young Man: Next time snatching Jiaojiao,
	Old Ding: Become a pig, become a dog, become a cat!

Jiaojiao is a beautiful woman, next time is the next time. What about Old Ding?

He is the flunky and accomplice of the playboy, like the kind of person we now call a lackey. Such characters in Shaoxing opera are collectively called Old Ding. The reason for calling them Old Ding is probably a "respectful title" given to the servants of wealthy families by the oppressed.

He is very similar to the Teacher in Peking Opera "Killing the Fish Family," but different. Such characters in Peking Opera are usually played by clowns. In Shaoxing opera, however, they are not clowns. Which role do they belong to? They belong to "Erhualian" (Second Painted Face), which, as Mr. Lu Xun said, translated more elegantly, is "Second Clown."

I don't know if other opera genres have this Erchou (Second Clown) in their clown roles. In "Luantan Troupes," the painted faces, in addition to Dahualian (Net Face), Xiaohualian (Little Clown), are also divided into Erhualian, Sanhualian, and Sihualian, and the Erhualian - Erchou is especially important. There is a famous essay in "Zhun Fengyue Tan" (Almost Romantic Talk) called "The Art of Erchou," which is specifically about the character of this role. The main reason I think it needs to be annotated is because of this.

### 鲁迅先生和经典戏

    鲁迅先生和经典戏
    徐淦
    （一）
    鲁迅先生在“社戏”里说：“我在倒数上去的二十年中，只看过两回中国戏，前十年是绝不看，因为没有看戏的意思和机会。那两回全在后十年，然而都没有看出什么来就走了。”
    这里所说的二十年，根据“社戏”作于1922年10月，约当1902—1922；这里所说的后十年所看的两回中国戏，指的是京戏，其中后一回看了半折的，是龚云甫的“滑油山”。
    鲁迅先生又说：“我确记得在野外看过很好的好戏，到北京以后的连进两回戏园去，也许还是受了那时的影响哩。……至于我看那好戏的时候，却实在已经是‘远哉遥遥’的了，其时恐怕我还不过十一二岁。”
    这里所说的好戏，也就是绍兴的社戏了。
    当时在绍兴演社戏的有哪些剧种呢？据我所知，不外乎：一、京戏的“水路班子”，二、来自新昌嵊县的“沿山班”，三、绍兴当地古老的“高腔班”，四、绍兴当地最通行的“乱弹班”。
    而鲁迅先生迷人地描绘了的在他外婆家附近野外演出的那一台戏，可以推断是“沿山班”和“乱弹班”合作的。因为日戏既有连翻八十四个筋斗的铁头老生，夜戏又有几个赤膊的人翻了一阵筋斗，那是“文乱弹”所不会的武戏，非“沿山班”不办。这种班子，由于工武不工文，拉不住看客，后来都跟“文乱弹”合班了。
    鲁迅先生说：“然而我的意思却也并不在乎看翻筋斗。我最愿意看的是一个人蒙了白布，两手在头上捧着一支棒似的蛇头的蛇精，其次是套了黄布衣跳老虎。”
    这里所说的跳老虎，在好些戏里都有，特别的是在老虎跳出来之前，台上往往还有一个灰溜溜的小鬼跳上一转，那就是“为虎作伥”的伥鬼。
    这里所说的蛇精，是“白蛇传”里的青蛇、白蛇吗？不是的。这戏名叫“落绣鞋”，大意讲一个少女被蛇精背进山洞，一位勇敢的少年在山间拾到她落下的绣鞋，跟踪前往，与蛇精搏斗，救她脱险，显系取材于童话，别的剧种似乎没有这个剧目。
    鲁迅先生说：“忽而一个红衫的小丑被绑在台柱子上，给一个花白胡子的用马鞭打起来了，大家才又振作精神的笑着看。在这一夜里，我以为这实在要算是最好的一折。”
    这折使鲁迅先生以为最好的戏又是什么戏呢？
    这戏，据我看，是“文乱弹”的统本戏“五美图”当中的一折，单折名叫“游园吊打”，在它前面的一折名叫“争朝”，也是有名的好戏。“争朝”表现忠臣和奸臣在皇帝面前的激烈斗争，结果忠臣失败了，愤而弃职，这忠臣，就是鲁迅先生所说的花白胡子。他回到家中，恰巧遇着那个奸臣的儿子，带着老丁，闯进他家花园，正要强抢他的女儿。国仇家恨使他怒不可遏，他就把恶少逮住吊了起来，不顾一切地抽打，直到恶少罚神赌咒、写下服辩——悔过书为止。
    那服辩的词句很妙：
      恶少：抢姣姣，
      老丁：起祸苗！
      恶少：下遭再来抢姣姣，
      老丁：变猪变狗变阿猫！
    姣姣是美女，下遭即下回。老丁呢？
    他是花花公子的帮闲兼帮凶，仿佛现在叫作狗腿子的那类人物。这类人物在绍兴戏里，统称老丁。其所以称老丁，大概是被压迫者送给豪门家丁的“尊称”吧。
    他很像京戏“打鱼杀家”里的教师爷，但又不同。京戏里的这类人物，例归小丑扮演；在绍兴戏里，却不归小丑。归哪一行呢？归“二花脸”，如鲁迅先生所说，译得雅一点，就是“二丑”。
    这二丑，我不知道别的剧种的丑行里有没有。“乱弹班”的花脸，却除了大花脸（净），小花脸（小丑）之外，还有二花脸，三花脸，四花脸之分，而二花脸——二丑尤其重要。“准风月谈”里有一篇著名的杂文“二丑艺术”，正是专写这种角色的性格的。我所以认为有注解的必要，主要也因为这个。
                        （未完）
