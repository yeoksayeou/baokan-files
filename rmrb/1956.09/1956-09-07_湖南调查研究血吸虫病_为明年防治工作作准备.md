    Xinhua News Agency, Changsha – Hunan Province is vigorously conducting investigations and research on schistosomiasis in preparation for a comprehensive prevention and control effort next year. To date, health workers have conducted intradermal reaction injections and epidemiological surveys on 1.5 million residents in the Dongting Lake area and the Xiang, Zi, Yuan, and Li Rivers basins, basically determining the number of infected people and the factors contributing to the epidemic. More than 1,500 people are participating in this work.
    At the same time, health administrative departments have also transferred 1,500 physicians, nurses, and some health administrative cadres from hospitals throughout the province. After short-term training, they have established and strengthened two prevention and control institutes and 141 prevention and control stations and groups in various epidemic areas. In addition, research groups have been established in Yueyang and Yuanjiang to treat 290 patients with short-course antimony therapy and modified Jiajian Weiling Tang, respectively. Preliminary test results show that short-course antimony therapy is safe and reliable, with an efficacy rate of 93.2%. Modified Jiajian Weiling Tang also has a definite effect on eliminating ascites and improving symptoms. While conducting investigations, research, and prevention work, other prevention and control institutions in various regions have also carried out treatment. From January to the present, they have admitted more than 5,000 patients, of whom about 4,000 have been cured and discharged, including many late-stage patients.

    湖南调查研究血吸虫病
    为明年防治工作作准备
    据新华社长沙讯　湖南省正大力进行血吸虫病的调查研究工作，为明年全面展开防治工作作准备。到目前止，卫生工作人员已在洞庭湖滨地区和湘、资、沅、澧四水流域对一百五十万居民进行了皮内反应注射和流行病学的调查，基本上摸清了患病的人数和流行因素。参加这一工作的共有一千五百余人。
    同时，卫生行政部门还从省内各地医院抽调了一千五百名医师、护士和一些卫生行政干部，经过短期训练在各疫区建立和充实了两个防治所和一百四十一个防治站、组。此外，还在岳阳和沅江各设立了一个研究小组，分别采用锑剂短程疗法和中药加减胃苓汤对二百九十个患者进行治疗。初步试验结果证明：锑剂短程疗法安全可靠，疗效达93.2％；中药加减胃苓汤对消除腹水和改善症状也有肯定的疗效。其他各地防治机构在调查研究和预防工作的同时，也结合进行了治疗，从1月到目前止，共收治病人五千余人，现在已治愈出院的约四千人左右，其中有不少是晚期患者。
