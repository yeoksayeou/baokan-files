    Such "Reasoning"
    Ji Yan
    The Xinxiang City Timber Company's Storage and Transportation Section submitted a "Monthly Handling Plan Form" for July to the Xinxiang City Transportation Planning Committee for approval. However, by July 18th, it had not been approved. The Timber Company's Storage and Transportation Section repeatedly called and sent people to inquire, only to be told, "We haven't seen the plan; it must not have been delivered." Later, when the dispatcher went to inquire with the receiving logbook stamped with a bright red receiving seal, the comrades in the Transportation Planning Committee's office, unable to say "it definitely wasn't delivered" anymore, had to rummage through the mess of files in the drawer. Only then did they exclaim in surprise, "Oh! It was here all along!" Moreover, the plan had already been approved. Faced with such a situation, this comrade from the Transportation Planning Committee should have been speechless and admitted their mistake! Unexpectedly, this comrade came up with a reason for the backlog of files, saying, "Look, you didn't specify the address, how were we supposed to send it?" In fact, they didn't even consider that Xinxiang City only has one timber company, and it's only half a street away from the Transportation Planning Committee. The timber company's failure to specify the address may have been a minor oversight, but could that be a reason for "how were we supposed to send it!"?
    In our daily lives, there are indeed many such people. Although they don't "fly into a rage when criticized," they have all sorts of clever excuses to resist criticism and cover up their mistakes. Like this comrade from the Xinxiang City Transportation Planning Committee, they even resort to easily detectable errors to conceal their undeniable mistakes. Compared to "flying into a rage when criticized," this is essentially "different tunes played in the same key," and the result is only adding fuel to the fire, making their mistakes even worse.

    如此“理由”
    棘言
    河南省新乡市木材公司储运课给新乡市运输计划委员会送去一份7月份的“月度搬运计划表”，请求批准，但是，到了7月18日，还不见批下来。木材公司储运课三番五次地打电话和派人前往查询，得到的回答总是“没有看到这个计划，一定是没有送来”。后来收发员拿着盖有鲜红的收发章的收文簿前去查问的时候，运输计划委员会办公室的同志因为再不能说“一定没有送来”就只好在抽屉里乱七八糟的文件中翻寻了，这才大吃一惊地说：“呀！原来在这里”，而且这个计划早已被批准了。事到如此，运输计划委员会的这个同志该无话可说，承认自己的错误了吧！不料，这位同志却找出积压文件的理由来了，他说：“看，你们就没有写明地址，叫我们往哪儿发呀！”其实，他就没有想一想，新乡市就只这么一个木材公司，而且和运输计划委员会只有半街之隔，木材公司没有写明地址也许是个小疏忽，但这能够成为“往哪儿发呀！”的理由吗？
    在我们日常生活中，确实有不少这样的人，他们虽然没有“闻过则怒”，但是他们却有各种巧妙的借口来抵抗人家的批评，掩饰自己的错误，像新乡市运输计划委员会的这个同志甚至不惜用一眼就能识破的错误来掩盖自己无法辩解的错误。这与“闻过则怒”比较起来，实在是“异曲同工”，其结果只不过是火上加油，使自己错上加错罢了。
