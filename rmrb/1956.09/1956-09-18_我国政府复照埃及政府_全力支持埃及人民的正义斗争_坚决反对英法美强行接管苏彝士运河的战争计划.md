Xinhua News Agency, 17th: The Government of the People's Republic of China's reply to the Government of the Republic of Egypt's note of September 10, 1956, regarding the Suez Canal issue.

The Government of the People's Republic of China has received the Egyptian Government's note of September 10, 1956, regarding the Suez Canal issue, and is now honored to reply as follows:

I. The Egyptian government, in order to safeguard its sovereignty and independence, took the just action of nationalizing the Suez Canal Company on July 26, 1956. This just action has received the full support of the Chinese government and people from the very beginning. The position of the Chinese government and people on the Suez Canal issue has been fully clarified in the Statement of the Government of the People's Republic of China on the Suez Canal Issue on August 15, 1956.

II. The People's Republic of China, as a country that uses the Suez Canal extensively, has always agreed to hold an international conference with broad participation of the countries concerned using the canal to seek a reasonable way to peacefully resolve the issue of freedom of navigation of the Suez Canal, without prejudice to Egypt's sovereignty and dignity. In its statement on August 15, the Chinese government expressed its warm support for the Egyptian government's proposal of August 12 to convene an international conference. Regrettably, this reasonable proposal of the Egyptian government was not approved by the United Kingdom, France, and the United States. Instead, the United Kingdom, France, and the United States unilaterally convened the 22-nation London Conference without consulting Egypt. After Egypt rightfully refused to participate, such a conference clearly could not achieve a solution to the Suez Canal issue that could be accepted by all parties concerned; even if such a conference could reach a unanimous opinion, it would not be effective without Egypt's consent. At the London Conference, India put forward a proposal respecting Egypt's sovereignty and dignity, which was supported by the representatives of the Soviet Union, Indonesia, Ceylon and other countries participating in the conference. However, this reasonable proposal of India, which could lead to a peaceful solution to the Suez Canal issue, did not receive the due favorable response from the United Kingdom, France, and the United States. The Western countries put forward a so-called Dulles Plan, which is essentially an interference in Egypt's internal affairs and a violation of Egypt's sovereignty. After patiently listening to the Five-Nation Committee's explanation of this plan, the Egyptian government rejected it, which is completely reasonable.

III. After rejecting the Dulles Plan, the Egyptian government once again proposed on September 10 in its note to organize a negotiating body that adequately represents the different opinions of the countries using the Suez Canal, demonstrating the Egyptian government's unwavering desire for peace. The Chinese government warmly supports this proposal and is willing to make any effort to help realize it.

IV. Contrary to the Egyptian government's consistent stance of advocating peaceful negotiations, the governments of the United Kingdom and France have from the outset exerted tyrannical pressure on Egypt, taking various forms of military threats and provocations, and forcing foreign technical personnel from the Suez Canal to leave their posts, plotting to obstruct canal shipping, and creating pretexts for endangering peace, while the United States' attitude is to utilize and strengthen the actions of this military threat from the United Kingdom and France. On September 12, the British government even announced that the United Kingdom, France, and the United States would form a so-called "Canal Users' Association," attempting to openly deprive Egypt of its sacred sovereignty and forcibly take over the Suez Canal. The governments of the United Kingdom, France, and the United States have also announced that they will soon convene a meeting to conduct concrete consultations on this adventurous plan. This adventurous plan implies the danger of using force. This cannot but make the situation in the Suez Canal more complicated and serious.

V. The plan of the United Kingdom, France, and the United States to forcibly take over the Suez Canal is a blatant violation of the United Nations Charter. This is not only a serious provocation to the Egyptian people, but also a provocation to all Arab countries, Asian and African countries, and all countries and peoples in the world who love peace and justice. If the United Kingdom, France, and the United States do not pull back from the brink and abandon this war provocation plan, they will inevitably be opposed by all countries and peoples who love peace and justice, including the people of the United Kingdom, France, and the United States themselves. Egypt will never be isolated. China will stand firmly with Egypt, together with all peace-loving countries and peoples in the world, and fully support the Egyptian people's just struggle to safeguard national independence and state sovereignty.

VI. The Chinese government resolutely opposes the war plan of the United Kingdom, France, and the United States to forcibly take over the Suez Canal, firmly supports the Egyptian government's position of insisting on peaceful consultations, and believes that, according to the guidelines proposed by the Egyptian government, it is entirely possible and beneficial to all countries to reach an agreement on all issues related to the freedom of navigation of the Suez Canal through peaceful consultations among the countries concerned, based on the principle of respecting Egypt's sovereignty and dignity.

### 我国政府复照埃及政府  全力支持埃及人民的正义斗争  坚决反对英法美强行接管苏彝士运河的战争计划

    我国政府复照埃及政府
    全力支持埃及人民的正义斗争
    坚决反对英法美强行接管苏彝士运河的战争计划
    新华社17日讯　中华人民共和国政府对埃及共和国政府1956年9月10日关于苏彝士运河问题照会的复照。
    中华人民共和国政府收到了埃及政府1956年9月10日关于苏彝士运河问题的照会，现在荣幸地答复如下：
    一、埃及政府为了维护自己的主权和独立，在1956年7月26日采取了把苏彝士运河公司收归国有的正义行动。这一正义行动从一开始就得到中国政府和人民的完全支持。中国政府和人民对于苏彝士运河问题的立场，已在1956年8月15日中华人民共和国政府关于苏彝士运河问题的声明中得到充分的阐明。
    二、中华人民共和国作为一个日益广泛使用苏彝士运河的国家，一贯赞同在不损害埃及的主权和尊严的情况下，召开由使用运河的有关国家广泛参加的国际会议，来寻求和平解决关于苏彝士运河通航自由问题的合理途径。中国政府在8月15日的声明中曾经对埃及政府8月12日关于召开国际会议的建议表示热烈的支持。令人遗憾的是，埃及政府的这一合理建议并没有得到英、法、美三国的赞同，而英、法、美三国竟然没有同埃及协商就片面地召开了二十二国的伦敦会议。在埃及完全有道理地拒绝参加以后，这样一个会议，显然是不能够对苏彝士运河问题求得能为有关各国所一致接受的解决办法的；即使这样的会议能够取得一致的意见，如果没有埃及的同意，也是不可能有效的。在伦敦会议上，印度提出了尊重埃及主权和尊严的建议，并且得到了参加会议的苏联、印度尼西亚、锡兰等国代表的支持。但是印度的这个足以导致和平解决苏彝士运河问题的合理的建议，却没有得到英、法、美三国应有的有利反应。西方国家提出了一个实质上是干涉埃及内政和侵犯埃及主权的所谓杜勒斯方案。埃及政府在耐心地听取了五国委员会对这一方案的解释以后，拒绝了这一方案，这是完全合理的。
    三、埃及政府在拒绝了杜勒斯方案以后，在9月10日照会中又建议组织一个足以代表使用苏彝士运河各国的不同意见的谈判机构，表现了埃及政府坚持不渝的和平愿望。中国政府热烈地支持这一建议，并且愿意作出任何有助于实现这一建议的努力。
    四、同埃及政府一贯主张进行和平谈判的态度相反，英、法两国政府却一开始就对埃及施加横暴的压力，采取种种武力威胁和挑衅，并且强迫苏彝士运河外籍技术人员离职，阴谋阻塞运河的航运，制造危害和平的借口，而美国的态度正在利用和加强英法这一武力威胁的行动。9月12日英国政府竟然宣布英、法、美三国将组成一个所谓“运河使用国协会”，企图公然剥夺埃及的神圣主权，强行接管苏彝士运河。英、法、美三国政府并且已经宣布即将召开会议，就这一冒险计划进行具体商谈。这一冒险计划意味着使用武力的危险。这就不能不使苏彝士运河的局势更加复杂化和严重化。
    五、英、法、美三国强行接管苏彝士运河的计划是对于联合国宪章的公然违反，这不仅是对于埃及人民的严重挑衅，而且是对于所有阿拉伯国家、亚非国家和世界上一切爱好和平和正义的国家和人民的挑衅。如果英、法、美三国不悬崖勒马，放弃这个战争挑衅的计划，他们必将遭到一切爱好和平和正义的国家和人民的反对，包含英、法、美三国自己人民的反对。埃及绝不会是孤立的。中国将同全世界一切爱好和平的国家和人民一起坚决地站在埃及这一边，全力支持埃及人民维护民族独立和国家主权的正义斗争。
    六、中国政府坚决反对英、法、美三国强行接管苏彝士运河的战争计划，坚决支持埃及政府坚持和平协商的立场，并且相信，根据埃及政府建议的方针，在尊重埃及主权和尊严的原则下，经过有关国家的和平协商，就苏彝士运河通航自由有关的各项问题取得协议是完全可能的，也是对一切国家有利的。
