Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, September 9th: How to improve the leadership methods of the Youth League and fully exert the League's role was the central topic of discussion at the Youth League Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Representative Meeting held from September 4th to 8th.

The 217 representatives of six ethnic groups, including Mongolian, Hui, Han, Manchu, Solon, and Daur, who attended the meeting believed that since the Second Representative Congress of the Youth League Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in June of last year, young people of all ethnic groups in rural and pastoral areas had launched activities such as gleaning grain, accumulating fertilizer, digging wells, and harvesting grass, achieving remarkable results. The thousands of youth production teams and groups established in industrial and mining areas in cities such as Hohhot and Baotou complete and exceed their production quotas by 90% every month. However, there are still shortcomings and problems in the work of the League. Everyone believes that the Inner Mongolia League Committee was too eager for quick results when arranging work tasks, failing to prioritize tasks, and not adequately considering the dispersed nature of the region and the characteristics of ethnic groups. As a result, due to the small number of cadres and the heavy workload, the leadership of the work of the pastoral areas and ethnic minority youth was relaxed. There were many demands and little education for the youth, especially focusing on advanced youth while relaxing education and help for backward youth. In general, the youth were only concerned with their production and work, and rarely cared about their lives. The representatives also revealed at the meeting that the leadership of the Youth League Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee had long existed with shortcomings such as not going deep into the grassroots, lacking investigation and research, and often generally assigning tasks, which made some decisions impractical and tasks were assigned a lot but with little effect. They demanded that the leadership change this bureaucratic style of work in a timely manner.

The Youth League Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee pointed out at the meeting that the task of the League in Inner Mongolia in the future is to assist the Party committees at all levels to continue to strengthen the leadership of agricultural and pastoral production, while strengthening the work of the League in industrial construction. League committees at all levels should continue to thoroughly check the situation of the Youth League in implementing ethnic policies and vigorously cultivate ethnic minority cadres in order to accelerate the realization of the nationalization of the autonomous region's organs.

The meeting also requested that the responsible cadres of the League at the league and administrative district levels of the autonomous region must spend more than one-third of their time each year going deep into the grassroots to do the work of the League, in order to change the current generalized leadership style and better exert the active strength of the youth of all ethnic groups.

    青年团内蒙古自治区代表会议
    讨论改进团的领导作风和方法
    据新华社呼和浩特9日电　如何改进青年团的领导方法和充分发挥团的作用，是在9月4日到8日召开的青年团内蒙古自治区代表会议上讨论的中心议题。
    参加大会的二百一十七名蒙古、回、汉、满、索伦和达呼尔等六个民族的代表认为，从去年6月青年团内蒙古自治区第二届代表大会到现在，农村和牧区的各族青年展开了拣粮、积肥、打井和打草等活动，取得了显著的成绩。在呼和浩特和包头等城市工矿区建立的上千个青年生产队、组，每月都有90％的队、组完成和超额完成了生产定额。但是，团的工作中也还存在着缺点和问题。大家认为内蒙古团委在布置工作任务时，贪多求快，工作分不出轻重缓急，对地区分散的情况和民族特点照顾不够，结果因为干部少、任务重而放松了对牧业地区和少数民族青年工作的领导。对青年要求多、教育差，特别是抓住了先进而放松了对落后青年的教育和帮助，对青年一般只着重关心他们的生产和工作，很少过问他们的生活等问题。代表们在会上还揭露了青年团内蒙古自治区委员会领导上长期存在的不深入下层、缺乏调查研究和常常一般化地布置任务等缺点，因而使有些决定往往不切合实际，任务布置虽多却收效不大。他们要求领导上及时改变这种官僚主义的作风。
    青年团内蒙古自治区委员会在会上指出，今后内蒙古团的工作任务是在协助各级党委继续加强对农牧业生产的领导的同时，加强工业建设中团的工作，各级团委要继续深入检查青年团在贯彻执行民族政策中的情况，大力培养少数民族干部，以加速实现自治区机关民族化。
    会议还要求自治区各盟和行政区级的团的负责干部，今后每年一定要有三分之一以上的时间深入到基层去专门作团的工作，以改变目前一般化的领导作风，更好地发挥各民族青年的积极力量。
