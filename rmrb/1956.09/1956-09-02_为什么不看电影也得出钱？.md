    Why Do We Have to Pay for Movies We Don't Watch?
    I am a soldier stationed in the Agricultural Construction Unit of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps in Shajingzi, Aksu. We have a very strange rule here: when internal movies are shown, everyone except duty personnel, those on official errands, pregnant women, women with children, and those on sick leave approved by leaders, must pay 15 fen per showing, regardless of whether they watch the movie or not. The collection method is also mandatory.
    Why do we have this strange rule here? It is said that this is because some comrades are unwilling to watch movies, resulting in fewer tickets sold, which relatively increases the expenditure on propaganda and education.
    Watching a movie is supposed to be a pleasant thing, and 15 fen per movie is not too much. Why are some people unwilling to watch? There are good reasons for this. The movie screening time is generally from 8:00 PM to 9:00 PM, but some leading comrades often do not arrive on time. If the leaders don't come, the movie can't be shown; some leading comrades treat movie screenings as a good opportunity to conduct ideological education, giving long reports that never seem to end. As a result, movies often can't start on time. In some units, because the residence is relatively scattered, it takes more than ten *li* to go back and forth to watch a movie. Comrades work hard all day long. Who has the energy to sit in the movie theater waiting for the leaders to give long reports, or the energy to run back and forth? Moreover, most of the movies being shown are old, so everyone's interest is naturally even lower.
    Instead of studying the reasons why comrades are unwilling to watch movies and coming up with solutions based on the specific situation to attract everyone to watch movies, the leadership focuses solely on "increasing revenue" and adopts a mandatory approach to solve the problem. This approach is wrong.　A Reader

### 为什么不看电影也得出钱？

    为什么不看电影也得出钱？
    我是新疆生产兵团驻阿克苏沙井子农建部队的一个战士。我们这里有一个非常奇怪的规定，就是：内部放映电影的时候，除去勤务人员、公差人员、孕妇、有孩子的妇女和经领导同志批准的病休人员之外，其它的人，不论看不看，一律按每人每场一角五分钱收费。收费的方式，也是强制性的。
    为什么我们这儿会有这种奇怪的规定呢？据说这是因为有些同志不愿意看电影，卖票少了，相对地增大了宣教费支出的缘故。
    看电影本来是件愉快的事，每场电影花一角五分钱也不算多，为什么有人不愿意看呢？其中就大有道理了。原来电影放映时间一般都在晚上八点至九点，但是有些领导同志却常常不按时入场。领导同志不来，电影就不能放映；有的领导同志把放映电影当作进行思想教育的好机会，放映前做大报告，讲来讲去没个完。因此电影就经常不能按时开映了。个别单位，因为驻地比较分散，看一场电影来回得跑十几里路。同志们白天劳累一天，晚上谁还有精力坐在电影场里等领导同志，听大报告？谁还有精力跑路呢？而且放的多半是旧片子，大家的兴趣自然更不大啰。
    领导上不研究同志们不愿意看电影的原因，不根据具体情况想出办法来吸引大家看电影，却单纯从“增加收入”着眼，采取强迫命令的办法来解决问题。这种做法是不对的。　一读者
