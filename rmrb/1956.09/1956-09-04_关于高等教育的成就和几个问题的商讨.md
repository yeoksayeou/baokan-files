Discussion on Achievements and Several Issues in Higher Education
Zhang Zonglin

The Changing Face of Higher Education

Since the founding of New China seven years ago, the higher education sector has taken steady steps in reforming the old and establishing new universities, correctly implementing the Party and government's policies towards intellectuals. The strength of senior intellectuals in universities has been brought into play; Marxist-Leninist thought has established a dominant and leading position within universities; and all curricula, teaching materials, and systems have been reformed to become socialist. Looking at the entire work process, New China's higher education work has been basically successful, and national universities are already socialist universities in the true sense of the word.

The universities inherited from old China originally had two extremely disproportionate situations: on the one hand, there were the dilapidated 200-odd universities and colleges. Among these 200-odd schools, dozens were universities subsidized by imperialism, that is, tools of imperialist cultural aggression; about a hundred were schools controlled and monopolized by politicians fostered by the reactionary government, who engaged in power struggles and factional infighting; and there were also dozens of "diploma mill" private universities. Of course, there were also universities that painstakingly and diligently operated truly to cultivate talents, but they were few in number and were subjected to discrimination, oppression, and destruction by the reactionary government in every possible way. On the other hand, in the universities of old China, there were thousands of professors who loved the country and possessed specialized knowledge, including many well-learned and outstanding experts in science, literature, history, and philosophy, as well as many white-haired old professors who had dedicated half their lives to teaching. In addition to these, there were tens of thousands of energetic young lecturers and assistant teachers, and hundreds of thousands of vibrant and diligent young students.

Since the national liberation, the higher education sector, according to the guidelines and policies instructed by the Party and the government, has conducted acceptance, consolidation, reform, and creation, respectively, according to different objects and at different times. Generally speaking, the first step was acceptance, followed by a series of other tasks. Before 1951, dozens of universities subsidized by imperialism were difficult to work with because they had not been accepted; even the establishment of socialist political classes as required met with resistance. Later, once accepted, the obstacles of imperialist agents were swept away, and teachers and students immediately stood up. Almost simultaneously with the acceptance work, consolidation work was carried out. During this period, the guidance system was abolished, some harmful courses were discontinued, and school affairs committees were established and socialist courses were opened. Subsequently, ideological remolding studies were carried out in various movements (such as participating in land reform, resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, etc.). In 1952, the restructuring of departments and specialties and teaching reforms began, thus starting to reform the old and create the new.

Today's higher education is completely different compared to the early days of liberation. Not only has the number of teachers and students greatly increased (some have increased several times), but more importantly, national universities, from teaching content to administrative systems, belong to the socialist type and are socialist universities in the true sense of the word.

Achievements and Shortcomings of Teaching Reform

To meet the needs of socialist construction for a sufficient number and qualified quality of senior construction talents, the universities of old China could not shoulder such a great task. The universities of old China were dilapidated, corrupt, and pieced together. Before 1948, the top-ranked universities were called universities, followed by independent colleges, and then junior colleges. Universities had to establish at least four colleges. At the time, the most common were colleges of liberal arts, science, law, and business. There were also colleges of education, agriculture, medicine, and engineering. The whole school had two or three thousand students at most, and only a few hundred at least. Each college had several hundred students at most, and only dozens at least. As for the number of students in a department, it was even smaller, with as few as a dozen, and as few as one or two students in one grade of a department. Although there were many well-learned professors at that time, it was difficult to have the opportunity to "educate talented people." Independent colleges and junior colleges were even more rudimentary. Some schools had only fifty or sixty students, renting one or two private houses, and that was considered a university. Now, the cadres needed to realize national industrialization are not hundreds or thousands, but tens or hundreds of thousands. Therefore, if the restructuring of departments and specialties was not carried out, it would be impossible to imagine completing the task of training senior construction talents for building socialism. Therefore, the restructuring of departments and specialties began in 1952. After this reform, not only did the original universities greatly develop, but many new schools were also created during the restructuring. Taking Beijing as an example, in 1949 there were only a dozen universities with more than 10,000 students. Now, it has developed into thirty universities with seventy to eighty thousand college students. As for the establishment of specialties, the universities of old China could not even dream of it. Today, there are nearly 300 specialties nationwide. There are more than 180 types of engineering specialties alone. Each specialty has at least 100 students, and as many as thousands. If there had not been such a large-scale and resolutely implemented restructuring of departments and specialties, it would have been inconceivable to train nearly one million specialized talents in hundreds of specialties within two five-year plans. The merits of the restructuring of departments and specialties should be estimated from these aspects. It cannot be denied that many shortcomings, and even errors, occurred in the implementation. For example, some that should not have been adjusted were adjusted across the board, such as the adjustment of Zhejiang University. The fact that engineering and agricultural colleges did not set up science majors across the board was also a loss. Some that should have been adjusted were not adjusted in time and were put aside for a long time, such as the adjustment of books, which has not been fully completed to this day, and has also caused considerable losses. If the work had been done more carefully at the time, some of these shortcomings or errors could have been avoided. However, despite these shortcomings or errors, the restructuring of departments and specialties was a major event in the creation of New China's universities, and it was a basically successful major event.

The teaching reform that began in 1952 was a further development of the curriculum reform of 1950. After the first national higher education conference in 1950, it was proposed that the old university curricula must be reformed. However, the numerous university curricula, where to start, opinions were divided, and no consensus could be reached. In 1952, the policy of comprehensively and systematically learning from the Soviet Union was put forward. Therefore, teaching reform was immediately proposed, based on the teaching plans and syllabuses of Soviet universities, and the drafting and revision of teaching plans and over a thousand syllabuses for hundreds of specialties were started. To date, it has been basically completed, and the new teaching plans and syllabuses have been universally implemented.

Three years ago, a difficult task that everyone thought was impossible to start has now been basically completed. The chaotic and complex curricula of old Chinese universities have been reformed into teaching plans and syllabuses with certain specifications and scientific systems, thus creating a new teaching system. This cannot be said to be an amazing major event. With the teaching reform, teachers have been learning Russian and translating Soviet university textbooks, laying a preliminary foundation for the teaching content of New China's universities. Therefore, it should be said that the teaching reform was successful, not a failure. If there are shortcomings, it is that the combination with China's actual situation is insufficient. It can also be said that there is no spirit and essence of comprehensively learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. There is a bias of mechanically transporting it. There is less reference and critical absorption of the experience of other countries, less consideration of China's specific situation, and very little summary of China's own experience. Secondly, at the beginning of the reform, all measures overemphasized uniformity. Not only were teaching plans and syllabuses defined as legal, but many teaching methods were also rigidly stipulated, resulting in some unnecessary deviations. It is undeniable that these shortcomings not only increased resistance to teaching reform, but also caused some losses to universities in these years.

In order to enable higher education to better carry out new work in the future, I would like to put forward a few questions based on my personal opinions for the reference of higher education workers across the country.

Plans and Conditions for Training Cadres

First, the plan for training scientific and technical cadres and the conditions required to be met. In the past seven years, universities have enrolled nearly 700,000 students and graduated nearly 300,000 students, which cannot be said to be a great achievement. However, the plan for training cadres is extremely unthorough. How many specialized talents in various industries are needed in the country's construction cause that year, what is the ratio of senior and intermediate specialized talents, and what is the scope of each specialty? There is no conclusion to date. If calculated according to the needs proposed by various departments, the plan for training cadres (both in quantity and quality) is far from meeting the needs. However, based on the "using what is not learned" and "uneven distribution" reflected by all parties, the potential of cadres is still very large. Because these problems have not been resolved for a long time, the plan for training cadres often has blindness. In 1952, a large number of students were enrolled, and quality was not taken care of. In 1955, because attention had to be paid to quality, the enrollment growth rate slightly shrank (still increasing compared to 1954), and everyone thought it was too small. In 1956, the enrollment growth rate rose sharply again, increasing by more than 90% compared to 1955. Such a fluctuating plan will bring losses to the country's construction cause.

In order to ensure the realization of the plan for training cadres, necessary conditions should be available in terms of manpower, material resources, and other aspects. However, the source of new students is insufficient. In the past few years, high school graduates have not been able to meet the needs of university enrollment every year, and a large number of on-the-job cadres have been mobilized to apply for universities every year. This can only be regarded as a temporary measure, not a normal method. In addition, the growth of teachers is not commensurate with the increase in students. In terms of quantity, teachers do not seem to be in short supply. The teacher-student ratio in most majors is one to eight or nine, and in individual majors it is one to four or five. However, in the past few years, new teachers have almost all been undergraduates or graduates who graduated early, and even assistant teachers who graduated from specialized courses. The number of assistant teachers has exceeded 50% of the total number of teachers (it will exceed 60% after the autumn semester begins), and the number of assistant teachers in individual schools and many majors has exceeded 60%. The growth of university teachers is originally extremely slow. It takes at least ten years from university graduation to being able to become a professor. However, because the number of students has increased rapidly, assistant teachers have had to reluctantly prepare lessons and reluctantly start classes. The number of assistant teachers who start classes has exceeded 50% of the total number of assistant teachers. This inevitably affects the quality of teaching. In addition, in terms of basic construction, teaching equipment, books, and finance, although the state has strongly supported them every year, they still cannot keep up with the needs, which also affects the realization of the plan. The budget and final accounts of higher education do not match every year. The final accounts generally account for only about 80% of the budget, especially the budget for teaching equipment and basic construction is greater than the final accounts. In the final analysis, the main reason is that the president has almost no financial power. Universities are distributed throughout the country, and they dare to spend money only after asking the higher education department or its entrusted agency for instructions, which inevitably causes accumulation and waste. In 1954, the higher education department issued instructions to strengthen the financial power of presidents, but in reality, the financial power obtained by presidents is still extremely small.

During the country's transition period, it is inevitable that the conditions that can be supplied and the conditions that are planned to be needed do not fully match. We should not start only after all the conditions for training cadres are ready, but we should not be too far apart. If we measure from the current higher education training cadre plan and various possible supply conditions, the difference is not small. Therefore, the original plan should be reconsidered, otherwise it will lead to the consequences of "large quantity and poor quality."

Excessive Burden on Students and Teachers

Second, the problem of excessive burden on students and teachers. In order to build socialism, everyone should work hard, which no one will oppose. However, labor that exceeds people's physical and mental capacity will only cause irreparable losses and is harmful to the construction cause. In the past few years, students and teachers have not only worked and studied for more than ten hours a day, and have not been able to rest on Sundays, but also have production internships or other activities arranged during the winter and summer vacations, the essence of which is a disguised cancellation of the winter and summer vacations. The reasons for this situation are multifaceted: the teaching plan requires too high, the number of courses is too many, each course is a required course, the weekly class hours are too many (generally around 35 hours), there is a lack of suitable teaching materials, the teaching system has many tricks, which are neither completely reasonable, nor are they rigidly stipulated, and must be followed, coupled with the poor quality of teachers (shallow academic foundation, lack of teaching experience) and the inability to supply teaching equipment in a timely manner, which has already made teachers and students burdened, plus many social activities, multi-headed leadership of schools, and major and minor movements in society, and major and minor matters such as the unified purchase of oil and grain, are also uniformly assigned to schools to study, discuss, and write reports. The extracurricular burden of party members and league members is even heavier, with as many as ten to twenty hours per week. In the past few years, national universities, from early morning to late at night, from New Year's Day to New Year's Eve, have almost been like intense battlefields. As a result, students and teachers are exhausted, and the health rate is declining year by year. If this continues, the consequences will be unimaginable. If it is believed that the previous situation was unavoidable in the early days of the founding of the country, then it must be thoroughly improved in the future. I believe that the teaching plan and syllabus must be revised, the number of courses must be reduced, the number of required courses must be reduced, some elective courses must be added, the weekly class hours must be reduced, the repetitive and unnecessary teaching content must be reduced, some teaching systems must be improved (such as examinations, assessments, tests, classroom discussions, etc.), some forms and statistics must be reduced, unnecessary social activities and extracurricular activities must be reduced, some unreasonable administrative systems must be abolished or improved, and multi-headed arrangements for work in universities must be strictly controlled. University presidents and school party committees should have the right to decide to accept or reject tasks from outside the school. Universities should be quiet places for learning and having sufficient time to study and ponder, rather than noisy markets or battlefields full of gunfire. In order to normally train hundreds of thousands of future national construction cadres, and in order to cherish tens of thousands of university teachers, serious attention should be paid to reducing the burden on students and teachers in universities.

Give Full Play to the Spirit of Independence and Independent Thinking

Third, how can we give more play to the spirit of independence and autonomy of schools and the spirit of independent thinking of teachers and students? Some people believe that the emphasis on unity and collectivism in the past few years was wrong, thus obliterating the development of personality and blocking the spirit of creativity. I don't think this view is entirely correct. In the universities of old China, from curriculum content and teaching systems to administrative systems, they were chaotic, disorganized, and undisciplined. In order to vigorously reverse this trend, then strengthening collectivism and unified leadership, maintaining learning discipline, and establishing public morality played a certain role. The problem is not whether collectivism is needed, but how to "ensure that the broad masses of people can give full play to their individuality in their common life." In the past few years, in all aspects of teaching and administration, more emphasis has been placed on unity and collectivism, and not enough play has been given to the individuality of the broad masses of teachers and students, thus affecting the independent decision-making of principals, deans, and people at all levels within a certain range, affecting the independent thinking and creative spirit of teachers and students, and also increasing the burden on all school personnel (especially students and teachers). Under the system of layer-by-layer control and national uniformity, universities are somewhat unable to breathe. Now, the national teachers and students have a fairly high degree of awareness, the strength of the Party and the Youth League has grown, the atmosphere of academic contention among a hundred schools of thought is gradually unfolding, and the old-fashioned methods must be changed. In the future, in teaching, we should give more support to the independent creative spirit of teachers, abolish some rigid regulations, reduce the burden on teachers and students, correct some misunderstandings of all-round development in the past, and cultivate students' independent thinking style. In administration, principals and deans should be given greater independent decision-making power. Whether it is finance, basic construction, personnel, or other systems, they should be thoroughly checked and changed to do less interference and more assistance, establish a style of doing more assistance, more inspection, more summary, and exchange of experience. Some people worry that such a bold hand will lead to big problems. I believe that after seven or eight years of socialist education, the staff and students of universities, the vast majority of people have a certain political awareness and are heading towards building socialism. With this guarantee, there will be no big problems. As for the shortcomings or errors of individual people in their work, they are unavoidable, and they will always be unavoidable. We should not be afraid to move forward because we only see the shortcomings of individual people, and we should not choke on food because of fear of choking. Under the correct leadership of the Party, higher education work should and can be boldly released and move forward by leaps and bounds.

    关于高等教育的成就和几个问题的商讨
    张宗麟
    高等教育面貌的改变
    新中国成立七年以来，高等教育部门在改革旧的和创立新的高等学校方面，采取了稳当的步骤，正确执行了党和政府对待知识分子的政策。在高等学校里的高级知识分子的力量，得到了发挥；马克思列宁主义的思想已经在高等学校内树立了主导的和领导的地位；一切课程教材和制度也都已经改革成为社会主义的。从整个工作过程来看，新中国的高等教育工作基本上是成功的，全国高等学校已经是社会主义的高等学校了。
    旧中国遗留下来的高等学校，本来有着两种极不相称的情况：一方面是破败不堪的二百零几所大学和专科学校。在这二百多所学校中，有几十所是受帝国主义津贴、也就是作为帝国主义文化侵略工具的学校，有百来所是反动政府豢养的政客们把持包办、争权夺利、派系逐鹿的学校，还有几十所“学店”式的私立大学，当然也有苦心孤诣、惨淡经营，真是为了培育人才的大学，但为数很少，而且受到反动政府的歧视，压迫摧残，无所不至。另一方面，在旧中国的高等学校里，有几千名热爱祖国、学有专长的教授，其中有不少是饱学的优秀的科学、文学、史学和哲学等专家，也有不少白发苍苍半生执教的老教授，这以外还有上万名富有朝气的青年讲师、助教，十几万名生气勃勃勤奋好学的青年学生。
    全国解放以来，高等教育部门根据党和政府指示的方针政策，按照不同对象，在不同时期分别进行了接收、整顿、改革和创设。一般说，首先是接收，然后进行一系列的其他工作。在1951年以前，几十所受帝国主义津贴的高等学校因为没有接收，就很难对他们进行任何工作，甚至按规定要开设社会主义的政治课也遇到阻力。以后，一经接收，就扫除了帝国主义代理人的障碍，教师和学生们立即站起来。几乎和接收工作同时进行的是整顿工作。在这段期间，废除了训导制，停止了一些有害的课程，同时也建立了校务委员会和开设了社会主义的课程。接着是在各种运动中（如参加土地改革、抗美援朝等）进行了思想改造的学习。1952年开始院系调整、专业设置和教学改革，于是开始改革了旧的，也创设了新的。
    今天的高等教育同解放初期相比，完全两样了。不仅仅教师和学生的数量大大增加（有的已经增加到几倍），更重要的是全国高等学校从教学内容到行政制度都属于社会主义的类型，是名符其实的社会主义高等学校了。教学改革的成就和缺点
    要满足社会主义建设所需要的数量足够、质量合格的高级建设人才，旧中国的高等学校是担不起这样伟大的任务的。旧中国的高等学校是简陋腐败、东拼西凑的。1948年以前的列入头等的高等学校叫大学，其次是独立学院，再其次是专科学校。大学至少要成立四个学院，当时最普通的有文学院、理学院、法学院、商学院，也有设有教育学院、农学院、医学院、工学院的。全校学生多的两三千名，少的只有几百名。每个学院学生多则几百名，少的几十名。至于一个系的学生更少了，有少到十几名的，一个系的一个年级的学生有少到一两名的。尽管那时也有不少饱学的教授，也难以有“得英才而教育之”的机会。至于独立学院和专科学院更为简陋，有的全校学生只有五、六十名，租一、二幢民房，就算是一所高等学校了。现在，实现国家工业化所需要的干部不是几百几千，而是几万几十万，所以若不进行院系调整和专业设置，根本不能设想会完成为建设社会主义培养高级建设人才的任务，所以1952年开始了院系调整、专业设置。经过这次改革，不但原有的高等学校大大地发展了，而且在调整中创设了很多新校。就以北京来看，1949年只有十来所高等学校，一万多名学生，现在已经发展到三十来所高等学校，七、八万名大学生了。至于专业设置，更是旧中国的高等学校望尘莫及。今天全国已有近三百种专业，光是工科专业，已经开设的有一百八十多种。每种专业的学生少则百名，多则上千名。倘若没有这样大规模的而且是坚决执行的院系调整和专业设置工作，要在两个五年计划内培养出数量是近百万的、专业是几百种的专门人才，那是不可设想的。院系调整和专业设置的功绩应该从这些方面来估计。不可讳言，在执行中发生了不少缺点，有的还是错误。如有的不该调整的一律调整了，浙江大学的调整就是一例。工学院、农学院一律不设理科专业，也是一个损失。有的应该调整而来不及调整，长期搁起来，如图书的调整工作，到现在还没有完全做好，也造成不少损失。倘若当时工作做得更细致些，这些缺点或错误是可以避免一些的。不过尽管有这些缺点或错误，院系调整和专业设置，是创立新中国的高等学校的一件大事，而且是基本上成功的大事。
    1952年开始的教学改革是1950年课程改革的进一步的发展。1950年全国高等教育第一次会议以后，提出旧的高等学校课程必须改革，但是繁多的高等学校课程，从何着手，众说纷纭，莫衷一是。1952年提出全面地系统地学习苏联的方针，于是立即提出教学改革，以苏联高等学校的教学计划、教学大纲为依据，着手草拟修订几百种专业的教学计划和上千种教学大纲。到目前，基本上已经完成了，而且普遍地实施了新的教学计划、教学大纲了。
    三年前大家认为无从下手的艰难工作，今天基本上完成了。把旧中国高等学校头绪纷繁、内容庞杂的课程，改革成为有一定规格、合乎科学系统的教学计划和教学大纲，因而创立了一套新的教学制度。这不能不说是一件惊人的大事。随着教学改革，教师们学习俄文、译述苏联高等学校的教材，为新中国高等学校教学内容奠定了初步基础。所以应该说教学改革是成功的，而不是失败的。若说有缺点，那就是结合中国实际不够，也可以说没有全面地学习苏联先进经验的精神和实质，有机械搬运的偏向，对于其他各国的经验参考和批判地吸收较少，对中国具体情况考虑不多，总结中国自己的经验很少；其次，在改革开始，一切措施过分强调统一，不但把教学计划、教学大纲定为法律性的，很多属于教学方法的事件也有些硬性规定，因而产生若干不必要的偏差。不可否认，这些缺点不但给教学改革增加了阻力，在这几年里也给高等学校造成一些损失。
    为了今后使高等教育能更好地开展新的工作，凭着我个人的见解提出几个问题，供全国高等教育工作者参考。
              培养干部的计划和条件
    第一，培养科学技术干部的计划及其所需要具备的条件问题。七年以来，高等学校招生近七十万人，毕业生近三十万人，不能不说是一大成绩。但是培养干部计划是极不够周密的。究竟国家建设事业中需要的各行各业的专门人才那年需要多少，高级和中级的专门人才比例如何，各专业的口径如何，到现在没有定论。若照各部门所提的需要推算，培养干部计划（无论数量和质量）远远赶不上需要，但是根据各方反映的“用非所学”和“配备不均”的情况来推算，干部的潜力还很大。因为这些问题长期不得解决，所以培养干部计划常常带有盲目性。1952年大量招生，照顾质量不够；1955年因为要注意质量，招生增长率略略收缩（比1954年仍然有增加），大家又认为太少；1956年招生增长率又直线上升，比1955年增多90％以上。这样忽上忽下的计划，将会给国家建设事业带来损失。
    为着保证培养干部计划的实现，人力物力等各方面应该具备必要的条件。但是新生来源不足，过去几年高中毕业生年年不能满足高等学校招生的需要，年年动员大批在职干部报考高等学校。这只能作为临时的措施，不是正常的办法。另外，师资的成长和学生的增长不相称。以数量而论，师资似乎并不紧张，大多数专业的教师学生都在一比八或九，个别专业是一比四或五。但是这几年以来新师资几乎都是本科毕业或提前毕业的，甚至有专修科毕业的助教。助教数已经超过教师总数50％（秋季开学后将超过60％），个别学校和不少专业的助教数已经超过60％。大学师资的成长本来是极缓慢的，从大学毕业到能做教授，至少需要十几年。但是，因为学生人数增加很快，所以助教也不得不勉强准备功课，勉强开课，助教开课的人数已经超过助教总数的50％了。这样，难免影响教学质量。此外如基本建设、教学设备、图书以及财务等，国家虽然年年大力支持，但仍然赶不上需要，也就影响了计划的实现。高等教育的预算和决算，年年不相符合，决算一般只占预算80％左右，其中尤以教学设备费、基本建设费的预算大于决算。追究起来，校长几乎无财权是主要原因。高等学校分布全国各地，大小用款都向高等教育部或它的委托机关请示后才敢动支，必然造成积压浪费。1954年高等教育部曾经下过指示加强校长财权，但实际上校长所得财权仍然极小。
    在国家过渡时期，可能供应的和计划需要的条件不尽相符，这是难免的。我们不应该把一切培养干部的条件都准备停当才来动手，但也不应该相差太远。若从目前高等教育培养干部计划和各种可能供应条件来衡量，相差不小。所以应该重新考虑原定计划，否则将会造成“数量多、质量差”的后果。
    学生和教师负担过重
    第二，学生和教师负担过重的问题。为了建设社会主义，人人应该紧张工作，这是谁也不会反对的。但是超过人们体力和脑力所能负担的劳动，只会造成不可挽回的损失，对于建设事业有害无利。这几年以来，学生和教师不但每天超过十小时的工作、学习，星期日不得休息，而且在寒暑假期中，也都排上生产实习或其他活动，其实质是变相的取消了寒假暑假。造成这样情况的原因是多方面的：教学计划要求过高，课程门数过多，每门都是必修课，每周上课时数过多（一般都在三十五小时左右），缺乏合适的教材，教学制度花样多，既不完全合理，而又规定得死硬，非照做不可，再加上师资质量差（学术根底浅，教学经验少）以及教学设备不能及时供应等，已经使教师和学生负担不轻，再加上社会活动多，多头领导学校，社会上大小运动，大小事项如统购油粮等事，也一律硬派到学校去学习，讨论、写报告。党员、团员的课外负担更重，每周有多到十到二十小时的。这几年以来，全国高等学校从清晨到深夜，从元旦到除夕，几乎都像战争激烈的战场。因而学生和教师疲惫不堪，健康率逐年下降。长此以往，后果将不堪设想。倘若认为以往情况是建国初期所难免，那末今后必须彻底改善。我认为必须修改教学计划和教学大纲，减少课程门数，减少必修课，加些选修课，减少每周上课时数，减少重复的和不必要的教学内容，改进若干教学制度（如考试、考查、测验、课堂讨论等等），减少些表格和统计，减少非必要的社会活动和课外活动，废除或改善若干不合理的行政制度，严格控制对高等学校多头布置工作，高等学校校长和学校党委应该有权决定接受或拒绝校外来的任务。高等学校应该是安静的、学习的、有充分时间切磋琢磨的场所，而不是人声喧闹的市场或炮火连天的战场。为着正常地培养几十万个未来的国家建设干部，为着珍惜几万个大学教师，对于减轻高等学校学生和教师的负担应该引起高等教育工作者严重的注意。
    发挥独立自主和独立思考的精神
    第三、如何能够更多地发挥学校的独立自主和教师学生们独立思考的精神？有些人认为前几年强调统一强调集体是错误了，因而抹煞了个性发展，阻塞了创造精神。这种看法，我以为不完全对。旧中国高等学校里从课程内容、教学制度到行政制度，都是杂乱无章、散漫无纪的，为了大力扭转这种风气，那末，加强集体主义和统一领导，维持学习纪律、树立公共道德，是有一定作用的。问题不在乎是否要集体主义而在乎如何能够做到“保障广大人民能够发挥其在共同生活中的个性”。这几年以来无论教学和行政等各方面，都是强调统一和集体多，发挥广大教师学生在共同生活中的个性不够，因而影响了校长、院长和各级人员在一定范围内独立作主，影响了师生们的独立思考和创造精神，同时也增加了全校人员（特别是学生和教师）的负担。在层层控制、全国划一的办法之下，高等学校是有些喘不过气来了。现在全国师生已经有相当高的觉悟程度，党和青年团力量已经成长起来，学术上百家争鸣的风气逐渐展开了，老一套的办法必须改变。今后在教学上应该多多地支持教师们独立创造的精神，废除若干死硬的规定，减轻教师和学生们的负担，纠正过去对全面发展的若干误解，培养学生独立思考的学风。在行政上应该给校长、院长们更大的独立作主的权，无论财务、基本建设、人事等等制度，都应该彻底检查，改变干涉多帮助少的作法，树立多帮助多检查多总结和交流经验的风气。有人担心这样大胆放手将会出大岔子。我认为经过七、八年的社会主义各种教育的高等学校的工作人员和学生，绝大多数人都有一定的政治觉悟，朝着建设社会主义走，有此保证，就不会出大岔子。至于个别人在工作中的缺点或错误，那是难免的，而且是永远难免的。我们不应该光看到个别人的缺点而裹足不前，因噎废食。在党的正确领导之下，高等教育工作应该而且可以大胆放手，大踏步前进。
