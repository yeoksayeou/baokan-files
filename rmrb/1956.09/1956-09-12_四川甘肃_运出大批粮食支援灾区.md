Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 10th: Sichuan Province's planned extra-quota transfer of over 200,000 tons of grain for September is already being shipped out via the Yangtze River, Baoji-Chengdu Railway, and Sichuan-Shaanxi Highway. Combined with the over 270,000 tons of grain already shipped out in July and August, the province's grain transfer in the third quarter of this year has increased by more than 34% compared to the same period last year. The majority of this grain is used to support the people in the areas of North China and Jiangsu, Anhui, Shanghai, and other provinces and cities that have suffered from floods, insect plagues, or typhoon damage. A portion of the wheat seeds are to assist farmers in the disaster-stricken areas of Jiangsu and Anhui provinces.

With consecutive years of good harvests, Sichuan Province has more and more surplus grain. In particular, the Wenjiang Prefecture and Jiangjin Prefecture in the western Sichuan plain have provided large sources of grain for transfer. As early as last winter and this spring, farmers in various places took advantage of the agricultural off-season to transport the grain that needed to be transferred to the provincial highways, railways, and waterways, so that it could be shipped out at any time.

If the transportation problems to other provinces can be better resolved, Sichuan Province's grain transfer in the fourth quarter of this year will increase even more than in the third quarter.

Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 8th: Gansu Province will provide 29 million jin of grain to support disaster areas in Hebei, Shanxi, and other provinces. The first batch of 12 million jin of grain planned for September has already been loaded onto trains and transported eastward, and the remaining grain is being concentrated from all over the province to the railway lines, and will soon be shipped out as well. In order to quickly transport grain to support the disaster areas in Hebei, Shanxi, and other provinces, Gansu Province has mobilized a large number of cars, horse-drawn carts, manpower, and animal power to rush grain to the railway lines. In areas with inconvenient transportation, all grain is carried by people and animals. In Huining County, the grain carried by people and animals accounts for one-third of the total grain transported.

    四川甘肃
    运出大批粮食支援灾区
    新华社成都10日电　四川省9月份计划外调的二十多万吨粮食，已经陆续从长江和宝成铁路、川陕公路运出。连同7、8月份已经运出的二十七万多吨粮食，这个省今年第三季度外调的粮食比去年同期增加了34％以上。这些粮食大部分是用来支援华北和江苏、安徽、上海等省市遭受水灾、虫害或台风侵袭地区的人民的；其中有一部分小麦种是援助江苏、安徽等省受灾地区的农民的。
    连年丰收的四川省有了越来越多的余粮。特别是川西平原上的温江专区以及江津专区提供了大批外调粮源。早在去年冬天和今年春天，各地农民就利用农闲，把需要外调的粮食运送到省内公路、铁路和水路等交通线上，以便随时外运。
    如果通往省外的交通运输问题获得更好的解决，四川省今年第四季度外运粮食将比第三季度增加得更多。
    新华社兰州8日电　甘肃省将以二千九百万斤粮食支援河北、山西等省灾区。计划9月份支援的一千二百万斤粮食，首批已经装上火车东运，其余粮食正在从全省各地向铁路沿线集中，也即将运出。为了迅速运粮支援河北、山西等省灾区，甘肃省动员了大量汽车、马车、人力、畜力向铁路沿线赶运粮食。在交通不便的地方，一律用人背畜驮，会宁县用人背畜驮的粮食占运出粮食总数的三分之一。
