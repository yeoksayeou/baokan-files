    “Box Office Value”
    Jin Xiulong

    Modern people are always exposed to advertisements before seeing a movie or play, so the name of a movie or play should have some appeal to attract people to watch it. Recently, the China Youth Art Theater's performance of "Female Worker" lacks this kind of power. Because, judging from the name, female workers are the same as male workers, and there is really no reason to spend money to watch it. Some time ago, the Sichuan Drama Troupe performed "A Carpenter." If it hadn't been for招待 [hospitality/invitation], it would have been difficult to make people think they should go see it.

    In addition to names that are overly honest like "Female Worker" and "A Carpenter," there is also another type—slogan-like, such as "Strike at the Aggressors," "Infinite Potential," "Great Starting Point," "On the Road of Advancement," and so on. These names either tell you what they want to say as soon as you hear them, or you simply don’t know what they want to say at all. When performing "Strike at the Aggressors" during the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, it probably wouldn't be wrong to guess that the content is about striking at U.S. imperialism, but what "Infinite Potential" will say is a mystery! "On the Road of Advancement" is of course even more vague. Not only can many films since liberation be called this name, but even Soviet films like "Peter the Great" and "Michurin" can also be called this name.

    Therefore, the issue of the name of a play or film essentially reflects far more profound issues related to artistic management thinking and artistic creation. Many writers, performers, and producers often do not understand the psychology of the audience, thinking that as long as the content of the work reflects the lives of workers, peasants, and soldiers, everyone will like to watch it; or thinking that since writers have an obligation to write, theaters have an obligation to perform, and film studios have an obligation to produce films, everyone also has an obligation to watch, so there is no need to particularly attract them. However, people will never have such an obligation to art, whether in the past, present, or future; that is to say, people are willing to spend one yuan or thirty cents to buy a ticket because the name and content of the performance really attract them.

    Naturally, some movie or drama names are irrelevant, which in fact reflects the irrelevance of the content. In the end, there is no way to name it, so it is named… In short, it can be named anything. However, if a dramatic work (including movies) truly has a story, plot, and obvious dramatic conflict, and the central idea of the work is also very clear, then often the name is formed along with the work from the very beginning, although there will be revisions later, but doesn't the work itself also have revisions?

    I won't discuss the creation issues involved by the name here. If even the name of a work is mediocre, it is destined to have low "box office value." This means that no one buys tickets and the attendance rate is very poor. And this precisely illustrates that some writers, performers, and producers originally did not have the concept of whether it sells well or not!

    Of course, if a work only has a good name and other aspects are not worth taking, its purpose is nothing more than to trick the audience, or in other words, the name is attractive, but it does not completely match the content, which is not what I want to say. I want to clarify this point because there are already noteworthy problems in the current translated films.

    I thought it was good when people in the past translated Shakespeare's "Hamlet" (the film) as "The Prince's Revenge," because the name "Hamlet" can only attract a small number of intellectuals to watch it, and the general audience is unfamiliar with it. Moreover, the name "The Prince's Revenge" does not harm the content of the original work. But we now translate the Hungarian film "Relatives and Friends" as "Intrigue in Officialdom," and the Czechoslovak film "Frona" as "Two Sisters," which are not good. Because "Intrigue in Officialdom" is certainly not the central meaning of the film. Its central meaning is that family and friends relationships in officialdom are indeed very harmful. As for "Two Sisters," it actually only talks about the experiences of the older sister Frona, and does not say how the two sisters are. The whole play is not caused by the entanglement of the two sisters.

    Therefore, the names of movies and dramas should be pleasant to hear and attractive, but they must also be true to the name. If they are as contrary as "Intrigue in Officialdom" and "Two Sisters," then it is not good.

    “票房价值”
    金绣龙
    现代人接触电影或戏，总是先接触广告的，所以一部电影或戏的名字，也多少要带些吸引人去看的意思才对。最近中国青年艺术剧院上演的“女工”，就很缺少这种力量。因为照名字看来，女工和男工一样，实在没有什么必须花钱去看的理由。前些日子，四川话剧团演出“一个木工”，如果不是招待，也很难引起别人想到应该去看看的。
    除了“女工”和“一个木工”这样老实得过火的名字外，当然也还有另一种类型——标语口号型的，比如“打击侵略者”、“无穷的潜力”、“伟大的起点”、“在前进的道路上”等等。这种名字，不是一听见就知道它要说什么，便是根本不知道它要说什么。在抗美援朝的时候演出“打击侵略者”，其内容是说打击美帝国主义，大概是不会猜错的，但“无穷的潜力”将说什么，便是一个谜！“在前进的道路上”当然更是不着边际，不但解放以来的许多影片可叫这个名字，便连苏联影片“彼得大帝”、“米丘林”等等，也都是可以叫这个名字的。
    所以，一出戏或一部影片的名字问题，实质上反映了比这更深远得多的有关艺术经营思想与艺术创作等问题。不少作家、演出者、制片者，往往很不懂得观众的心理，以为只要作品内容反映了工农兵的生活，大家都是一律爱看的；或者以为作家既然有义务写作，剧场有义务演出，制片厂有义务生产影片，大家也就有义务去看，所以用不着特别吸引他们。殊不知，人民对于艺术，无论是过去、现在和将来，都是不会有这种义务的；也就是说，人们愿意花一块钱或三毛钱去买一张票，乃是因为演出的名字和内容都确实吸引了他。
    自然，有些电影或戏剧的名字不着边际，实则也反映了内容的不着边际，搞到后来，无以名之，名之曰……总之，名之曰什么都可以。可是，一部戏剧作品（电影也在内）如果真正是有故事，有情节，有明显的戏剧冲突，作品的中心思想也是很明确的话，他往往是从作品开始形成的时候，便连名字也一块形成了，虽然后来还会有修改，但是作品本身不是也还会有修改么？
    由名字而涉及到的有关创作问题，这里不去说它。如果连作品名字也是平庸的，就注定了它的“票房价值”不高。意思是说，没人买票，上座率很差。而这也正是说明了：某些作家、演出者、制片者们的心里，原本就没有卖座好不好这一类的观念！
    当然，如果一部作品只有一个名字是好的，其它都不足取，它的宗旨无非是叫观众上当，或者说，名字吸引人，但和内容不尽吻合，这都不是我要说的意思。要说明这点，乃是因为在目前的翻译片中，已经有着值得引起注意的问题了。
    从前人把莎士比亚的“哈姆雷特”（影片）译做“王子复仇记”，我以为是好的，因为“哈姆雷特”这名字，实在只能吸引少数的知识分子去看，广大的观众对它是陌生的，何况“王子复仇记”这名字，也并不损害原作的内容。但我们现在把匈牙利的影片“亲友们”译做“官场斗法记”，把捷克斯洛伐克的影片“弗洛娜”译做“姐妹俩”，便都不好。因为“官场斗法记”确实不是影片的中心意思。它的中心意思是说官场生活中的亲友关系，确实害事不浅。至于“姐妹俩”实则它只说了姐姐弗洛娜的遭遇，并未说姐妹俩如何如何。全戏更不是由姐妹俩的纠葛所引起的。
    因此影剧的名字要动听，吸引人，但也需名副其实。如其背谬若“官场斗法记”、“姐妹俩”者，就不好了。
