Welcoming the Peak Season for Procurement of Agricultural and Sideline Products
    Hu Zhiming
    The peak season for purchasing cotton, tobacco, hemp, hides, feathers, and other products is about to arrive. Approximately three-quarters of the total annual planned procurement value will be completed in the autumn and winter seasons. This is an extremely arduous task.
    What new issues does agricultural cooperativization pose for this year's procurement work? What are the characteristics of this year's procurement work?
    Before agricultural cooperativization, individual farmers decided when to sell their products and how much to sell at one time based on the urgency of their need for money and the high or low market purchase prices. The usual situation was: they sold as much as they needed, and if they didn't need money for the time being, they preferred to keep the goods; they would sell more when the market purchase price was high, and they would sell as little as possible or not at all when the purchase price was low. Therefore, individual farmers often dragged out the time they sold their products for a long time. After the implementation of unified distribution by agricultural production cooperatives, it is necessary to quickly sell the products that should be sold after the autumn harvest and distribute the cash and the remaining materials to the members. Cooperatives require the timely, large-scale, and concentrated sale of agricultural and sideline products. This is the characteristic of this year's procurement work. The state procurement departments have adapted to this characteristic and have put forward the procurement policy of "quick collection and more collection." This is completely correct.
    How can we better implement the procurement policy of "quick collection and more collection"?
    Some procurement personnel, and even leaders of procurement units, do not understand the new requirements of agricultural cooperatives and farmers, and often look at new problems with old eyes. They think: This year's pre-purchase plan has been completed quite well, the state and the cooperatives have already signed pre-purchase contracts, so what is the problem with completing this year's procurement task? Many possible difficulties are covered up by this "optimistic" and paralyzing thinking, which makes them completely relax the preparations that should have been stepped up. I ask: When many agricultural production cooperatives send large quantities of agricultural and sideline products at the same time, can we guarantee that they will be graded, evaluated, and purchased in a timely and correct manner? Can the整装, processing, storage, safekeeping, and transportation be done well? At that time, if we refuse to purchase, the agricultural production cooperatives will certainly be dissatisfied; if we accept them carelessly, what if we cannot store and keep them properly?
    Others believe that the grassroots procurement stations have few people and limited warehouse capacity, so the policy of "quick collection and more collection" cannot be implemented. They either keep asking the higher authorities for people, money, and things, or they adopt a negative attitude and actually resist the implementation of the "quick collection and more collection" policy.
    After all positive factors have been fully utilized by procurement units at all levels, if there are still insurmountable difficulties in storage, processing, and transportation, they should rely on agricultural cooperatives and the masses of farmers to solve them. With the prior consent of the agricultural cooperative, the method of purchasing products in batches and phases can be adopted, with the cooperative temporarily storing and keeping a portion of the products for the state. The procurement unit can pay a certain storage fee, or it can allow the agricultural cooperative to process and transport the products on its behalf. In this way, the procurement unit can overcome its own difficulties and help the agricultural cooperative to develop sideline production, which is beneficial to both the state and the farmers.

    迎接农副业产品采购旺季
    胡致明
    棉花、烟、麻、皮张、羽毛等产品的收购旺季就要到来，约占全年计划采购总值四分之三的收购任务，要在秋冬两季完成。这是一项极为繁重的任务。
    农业合作化给今年的采购工作提出了什么新问题？今年的采购工作有哪些特点呢？
    在农业合作化以前，个体农民在什么时候出卖产品，一次要卖多少产品，是根据用钱的急缓和市场收购价格的高低来决定的。通常的情况是：他们需要用多少钱就卖多少东西，如果暂时不用钱，宁愿存下东西；市场收购价格高了就多卖些，收购价低了，就尽量少卖或不卖。因此，个体农民出卖产品的时间常常拖得很长。农业生产合作社实行统一分配，秋收以后，需要很快地把该出卖的产品卖掉，把现款和其余的实物分配给社员。合作社要求及时地、大量地、集中地出卖农副业产品。这就是今年农产品采购工作的特点。国家采购部门适应这种特点，提出了“快收多收”的采购方针。这是完全正确的。
    怎样很好地贯彻执行“快收多收”的采购方针呢？
    有些采购工作人员，甚至采购单位的领导人员，不大了解农业合作社和农民的新要求，经常用旧眼光来看新问题。他们想：今年的预购计划完成得很不坏，国家和合作社已经签订了预购合同，完成今年的采购任务还有什么问题呢？许多可能遇到的困难被这种“乐观”的、麻痹的思想掩盖起来，使他们完全放松了本该加紧进行的准备工作。试问：当许多农业生产合作社把大批农副业产品同时送来的时候，能够保证及时地、正确地验级、评价和收购吗？整装、加工、储存、保管和运输都能作好吗？到那时候，如果拒不收购，农业生产合作社一定不满意；如果马马虎虎地收下，储存、保管不了怎么办呢？
    另有些人认为：基层采购站人手不多，仓库容量有限，“快收多收”的方针无法执行。他们或者一味向上级要人、要钱、要东西，或者抱定消极态度，在实际上抗拒执行“快收多收”的方针。
    各级采购单位充分发挥了一切积极因素之后，如果在储存、加工和运输等方面还有难以克服的困难，应该依靠农业社和农民群众来解决。可以事先商得农业社的同意，采取分期分批收购产品的办法，由合作社暂时替国家储存和保管一部分产品，采购单位可以付给一定的保管费用，也可以让农业社代为加工和运输。这样，采购单位既可以克服自己的困难，又能够帮助农业社开展副业生产，对国家和农民都有益处。
