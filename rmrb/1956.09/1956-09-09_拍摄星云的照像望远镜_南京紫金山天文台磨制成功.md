Photographic Telescope for Photographing Nebulae
Successfully Ground by Nanjing Purple Mountain Observatory

(Our newspaper Nanjing dispatch) A Schmidt-type photographic telescope, with a lens diameter of 12.5 centimeters and a reflecting mirror diameter of 20 centimeters, has been successfully ground by the Nanjing Purple Mountain Observatory. This type of "Schmidt" telescope can be used in astronomy to search the sky and photograph nebulae. It can obtain small and clear star images in a relatively large field of view and can photograph sky maps. At the same time, because of its strong light power, it can capture relatively faint stars. According to relevant personnel from the Purple Mountain Observatory, the "Schmidt" telescope has never been manufactured in China before.

Yang Shijie and Zhang Junde, research interns at the Purple Mountain Observatory, began grinding the "Schmidt" telescope in early March this year. During the grinding process, they referred to some relevant foreign books and, based on their own design, successfully ground and installed it recently. They once attached the self-made "Schmidt" telescope to the frame of the observatory's small equatorial telescope and tested it by taking photographs of the Milky Way region. During the shooting, the exposure was only ten minutes, and stars of the fourteenth and fifteenth magnitude had already been captured. The star images were fine and dense, and the star images seen on the negative were round dots all the way to the edge, with very good results.

The Purple Mountain Observatory has recently begun grinding another larger "Schmidt-type" photographic telescope, with a lens diameter of 20 centimeters and a reflecting mirror of 30 centimeters, which will be used to photograph even fainter stars in the future.

    拍摄星云的照像望远镜
    南京紫金山天文台磨制成功
    本报南京讯　南京紫金山天文台磨制的一具透镜直径十二点五厘米，返光镜直径二十厘米的“施密特型”照像望远镜已经成功。这种“施密特”镜在天文上可以用来搜觅星空和拍摄星云，它能在比较大的视野里得到细小清晰的星象，可以拍摄天图；同时因为它的光力强，可以摄出比较暗弱的星点。据紫金山天文台有关人员谈，“施密特”镜过去在国内从来没有制造过。
    紫金山天文台研究实习员杨世杰和张俊德从今年3月初开始磨制“施密特”镜，在磨制中曾经参考了一些国外有关书籍，并根据自己的设计，在最近把它磨制安装成功。他们曾经把自制的“施密特”镜附装在天文台的小赤道仪望远镜的架子上，试行拍摄银河区域的照片。拍摄时，露光只十分钟，而十四、十五等的微星都已经摄入，星象细而密，从底片上看到的星象一直到边上都呈圆点，效果很好。
    紫金山天文台最近正开始另外磨制一具更大的“施密特型”的照相望远镜，它的透镜直径是二十厘米，返光镜是三十厘米，将来可以用它拍摄更微弱的星象。
