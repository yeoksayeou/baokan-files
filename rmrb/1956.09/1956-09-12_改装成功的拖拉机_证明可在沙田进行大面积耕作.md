This newspaper, Guangzhou, 11th dispatch: The fact has been fully proven that tractors can be used for large-scale farming in paddy fields in the Shatian area.

The "Dete-54" tracked tractor and the "Retuo-25K" small rubber-wheeled tractor, successfully modified by the Zhongshan Agricultural Machinery Tractor Station in Guangdong Province, have recently completed the summer cultivation task of more than 13,000 mu of paddy fields.

During this summer cultivation, the Zhongshan Agricultural Machinery Tractor Station dispatched fifteen tractors to support farmers in the Shatian area who lacked labor. The "Dete-54" tracked tractor, dragging a disc heavy harrow, could harrow 110 to 150 mu of paddy field every eight hours in paddy fields with a water depth of six to nine centimeters and heavy soil, with a harrowing depth of 18 to 24 centimeters. The "Retuo-25K" small rubber-wheeled tractor, pulling a three-furrow plow or a wooden roller to level the soil, could also cultivate about 40 mu of land every eight hours, with a plowing depth of 14 centimeters, about twice as deep as plowing with an old-fashioned plow pulled by an ox.

In the past, Tanbei, Wuliusha, and other townships in Zhongshan County adopted a double-cropping system of rice. After the realization of cooperation this year, farmers in these townships, in order to increase production, decided to transplant late-season rice seedlings only after the summer harvest, but they had always been worried about the difficulty of overcoming the shortage of labor. Now, with tractors doing the plowing, they are not only able to transplant late-season rice seedlings in a timely manner but also greatly reduce the labor intensity of the commune members. The farmers are also satisfied with the quality of tractor cultivation and are full of confidence in realizing agricultural mechanization in the Shatian area.

    改装成功的拖拉机
    证明可在沙田进行大面积耕作
    本报广州11日电　拖拉机可以在沙田地区下水田进行大面积的耕作，已经得到充分的事实证明了。
    广东省中山农业机器拖拉机站改装成功的“德特—54”链轨式拖拉机和“热托—25K”小型胶轮式拖拉机，最近已经胜利地完成了一万三千多亩水田的夏耕任务。
    在这次夏耕中，中山农业机器拖拉机站出动了十五台拖拉机，支援缺乏劳动力的沙田地区农民。“德特—54”链轨式拖拉机拖着圆盘重耙，在水深六公分到九公分土质粘重的水田上，每八小时能耙田一百一十亩到一百五十亩，耙深十八公分到二十四公分。“热托—25K”小型胶轮式拖拉机牵引着三铧犁犁田或牵引木滚碌平土，每八小时也能耕地四十亩左右，犁深十四公分，比用牛牵引旧式犁耕深一倍左右。
    中山县坦背、五六沙等乡过去是采用水稻双季间作法的。今年实现合作化以后，这些乡的农民为了提高产量，决定在夏收以后才插晚造秧，但他们一直都担心劳动力不足的困难难于克服。现在，因为有了拖拉机代耕，不但能够及时插下晚造秧而且大大地减轻了社员的劳动强度。农民对拖拉机耕作的质量也表示满意，并且对于在沙田地区实现农业机械化充满了信心。
