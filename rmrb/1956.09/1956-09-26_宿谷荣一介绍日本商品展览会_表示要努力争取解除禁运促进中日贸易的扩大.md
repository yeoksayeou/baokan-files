Xinhua News Agency, September 25th: Sukegawa Eiichi, head of the Japanese commodity exhibition delegation, said at a press conference for Chinese and foreign journalists today that the exhibition of Japanese commodities in China would promote the expansion of trade and the exchange of culture and technology between China and Japan, thereby contributing to the restoration of normal diplomatic relations between the two countries.

When introducing the exhibition, Sukegawa Eiichi said that the scale of this exhibition greatly exceeded that of previous Japanese commodity exhibitions held in various parts of the world.

The head of the delegation said that the preparation of the exhibition was restricted by the embargo regulations. Due to the strong demands of the organizer of the exhibition, the Japan International Trade Promotion Association, the supporters, the Diet Members' League for Promoting Japan-China Trade and the Japanese Local Assembly Members' League for Promoting International Trade, the endorsers, the Japan-China Import and Export Association and the China-Japan Trade Association, as well as 57 industrial and commercial groups, 59 local autonomous organizations, and people from all walks of life, the Japanese government approved the exhibition of some embargoed items in May. He also said that there were still many commodities that they wanted to exhibit that could not be brought. This is very regrettable.

In response to questions from reporters, Sukegawa Eiichi said that the embargo was not only unprofitable for the Japanese economy, but also harmful. He stated that he would definitely work to lift the embargo in the future. Then, he talked about the future of trade between China and Japan. He said that in order to better develop trade between China and Japan, he hoped that diplomatic relations between China and Japan would be restored as soon as possible, even if it was an hour earlier.

At the reception, Sukegawa Eiichi expressed his gratitude to the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, the technical experts, artists, and staff of all relevant parties for their assistance in preparing the exhibition.

More than 50 Chinese and foreign reporters attended today's reception.

    宿谷荣一介绍日本商品展览会
    表示要努力争取解除禁运促进中日贸易的扩大
    新华社25日讯　日本商品展览团团长宿谷荣一在今天举行的中外记者招待会上说，这次日本商品展览会在中国的展出，会促进日中两国贸易的扩大和文化、技术的交流，从而会有助于恢复两国正常的邦交。
    宿谷荣一在介绍展览会的时候说，这个展览会大大超过了日本以前在国外各地所举办的商品展览会的规模。
    这位团长说，在筹备展览会时，受到了禁运条例的限制。由于这个展览会的主办者日本国际贸易促进协会，支援者日本国会议员促进日中贸易联盟、日本地方议员促进国际贸易联盟，赞同者日中输出入协会、中日贸易会，以及五十七个工商界团体、五十九个地方自治组织和各阶层人民的强烈要求，日本政府才在5月认可展出一部分禁运品。他又说，但是仍然有许多想展出的商品，不能够带来。这是令人非常遗憾的。
    宿谷荣一在回答记者提出的问题的时候说，禁运对日本经济不但无利，而且有害。他表示今后一定要为争取解除禁运而努力。接着，他谈到了中日两国贸易的前途。他说，为了更好地开展中日两国的贸易，他希望中日两国邦交早一天恢复，那怕早一个钟头也好。
    在招待会上，宿谷荣一对协助筹备展出的中国国际贸易促进委员会、各有关方面的技术专家、美术家和工作人员，表示感谢。
    出席今天招待会的中外记者共有五十多人。
