Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, September 1st. The Kunyang Phosphate Mine, the largest phosphate mine in the country, completed its annual mineral deposit exploration plan four months and five days ahead of schedule.

The 528 Exploration Team, which is responsible for exploring the phosphate mine, explored twice as much mineral deposits this year than last year. The phosphate ore explored in the past two years can supply a large-scale factory with an annual output of 600,000 tons of phosphate fertilizer for forty years. The phosphate ore layers they explored are very thick, averaging around nine meters; the quality of the ore is also very good, with an average phosphorus content of about 30%. Many ore veins are exposed on the ground, and the cost of open-pit mining is much cheaper than conventional terrace mining.

Exploration of the Kunyang Phosphate Mine began in early last year. Over the past year, explorers have traveled throughout thousands of square kilometers of barren mountains and valleys, spending two long rainy seasons in the field. This year, the exploration team also conducted nearly 2,000 square kilometers of general survey work in several counties near Kunyang. The results proved that the phosphate mineral reserves in this area are very rich, and the quantity is more than three and a half times the total reserves surveyed last year, making it one of the largest phosphate mines in the world.

The Kunyang Phosphate Mine was discovered in 1938, but the Kuomintang government never explored it before liberation.

### 世界上最大的磷矿之一  昆阳磷矿勘探计划提前完成

    世界上最大的磷矿之一
    昆阳磷矿勘探计划提前完成
    新华社昆明1日电　全国最大的磷矿——昆阳磷矿，提前四个月零五天完成了今年的矿量勘探计划。
    担负勘探磷矿任务的528勘探队，今年探出的矿量比去年多两倍。这两年勘探的磷矿可供一个年产六十万吨磷肥的大型工厂生产四十年。他们探明的磷矿矿层都很厚，平均在九公尺上下；矿石的质量也很好，平均含磷量在30％左右。许多矿脉露出地面，进行露天开采时的成本，比通常的梯级开采便宜得多。
    昆阳磷矿的勘探工作是从去年初开始的，一年多来，勘探队员们跑遍数千平方公里的荒山野谷，在野外度过了两个漫长的雨季。这个勘探队今年还在昆阳附近的几个县，进行了近二千平方公里的普查工作，结果证明这一带磷矿的储藏量非常丰富，其数量比去年普查的储量总数多三倍半以上，是世界上最大的磷矿之一。
    昆阳磷矿在1938年就被发现了，但解放以前国民党政府却一直没有勘探过。
