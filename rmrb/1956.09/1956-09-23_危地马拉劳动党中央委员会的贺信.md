Letter of Greetings from the Central Committee of the Guatemalan Labor Party

    As the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China convenes, the Guatemalan Labor Party, fighting against the reactionary dictatorial government imposed on our country by the open armed intervention of the United States, extends its sincere and profound respect from its fighting posts to the great Chinese people and their glorious vanguard.
    Since the October Socialist Revolution, the Chinese revolution has become the most important and decisive event in human history. It has prompted hundreds of millions of people to liberate themselves from exploitation and slavery. It has also exerted a tremendous influence on the development of the international situation, accelerated the collapse of the decaying colonial system, and promoted the national independence struggles of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America.
    The heroic Communist Party of China has absorbed the most valuable elements from the long and inexhaustible traditions of its own people, and guided by the creatively invincible Marxism-Leninism, it has not only liberated more than six hundred million people from the oppression of feudalism and imperialism, but has also enriched the theory and practice of anti-feudal and anti-imperialist revolutions in colonial, semi-colonial, and dependent countries, and has enriched the forms of the dictatorship of the proletariat and the path of socialist construction.
    The Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, held after the historic victory of the great Chinese revolution, is convened at a moment of great significance to mankind. Although imperialism is engaging in provocations and spreading slander at this time, attempting to extend the shadow of war, the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism has become stronger, its economy is constantly developing, its culture and technology are flourishing, and its national defense power is even stronger. Moreover, the desire for peace and socialist ideas in the hearts of all people around the world are far stronger than the decadent ideas of the bourgeoisie and the interests of imperialism.
    We, the Guatemalan communists, are convinced that through the discussions of this historic congress, the road to victory will be smoother and more guaranteed. This road for the current great Chinese people is the construction of socialism and the integrity of all territories. This congress will undoubtedly provide new and valuable experiences and lessons to all fraternal parties. Once these experiences are applied according to the actual conditions of each country, it will greatly contribute to the final victory over the oppressors.
    Our Party is now conducting underground struggles under the cruel suppression of the traitorous group that directly serves the US monopoly capitalist groups. The Party leads the struggle of the people of the whole country for national independence and democracy. The various victories of the Chinese people, specifically, the results of your Party's Eighth National Congress, can not only inspire our Party's struggle, open up new prospects for us, and provide important experience on our road to victory, but also bring a fatal blow to the common enemy of the people of all countries—imperialism.
    As we congratulate the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China on its great and abundant achievements, we, in the name of all Guatemalan communists, once again extend our warm greetings to the great Chinese people, to the glorious Communist Party, to your heroic and outstanding Central Committee, and to your great leader Comrade Mao Zedong.
    Long live the great Chinese revolution for peace, democracy, national independence, and socialism!
              Central Committee of the Guatemalan Labor Party
              Guatemala, September 1956

    危地马拉劳动党中央委员会的贺信
    在中国共产党第八次代表大会召开的时候，为反对由美国公开武装干涉而强加于我国的反动独裁政府而斗争的危地马拉劳动党，从它的战斗的岗位上向伟大的中国人民及其光荣的先锋致以真挚的崇高的敬意。
    十月社会主义革命以后，中国的革命在人类历史上成了最重要的有决定意义的事情。它促使亿万人民从受剥削和奴隶的状态中解放出来，它也在国际形势的发展中产生了巨大的影响，加速了腐朽的殖民制度的崩溃，推动了亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民的民族独立斗争。
    英勇的中国共产党从本国人民悠久的取之不尽的传统中吸取了最有价值的东西，以创造性的战无不胜的马克思列宁主义为指导，它不只把六亿多人民从封建主义、帝国主义的压迫下解放了出来，而且还丰富了殖民地、半殖民地和附属国家反封建反帝国主义革命的理论和实践，丰富了无产阶级专政的形式和社会主义建设的道路。
    在伟大的中国革命历史性胜利后举行的中国共产党第八次代表大会，是在对人类有巨大意义的时刻召开的。尽管在这时候帝国主义进行着挑衅和散布诽谤，企图伸展战争的阴影，但是和平、民主、社会主义阵营已更为强大，它的经济不断发展，文化技术蒸蒸日上，国防威力也更为强大。而且，和平愿望和社会主义思想在全世界所有人民的心目中，已经远较资产阶级的腐朽观念以及帝国主义利益为强大。
    我们危地马拉共产主义者确信，通过这次历史性代表大会的讨论，走向胜利的道路将更加平坦和得到保证。这条道路对目前伟大的中国人民来讲就是建设社会主义和全部领土的完整。这次大会无疑地还会向所有的兄弟党提供新的和有价值的经验和教益，这些经验一旦根据各国实际情况加以应用时，它将大大有助于击败压迫者的最后胜利。
    我们的党现在在直接为美国垄断资本家集团服务的卖国集团残酷镇压下进行地下斗争。党领导着全国人民争取民族独立和民主的斗争。中国人民的各种胜利，具体说，你们党第八次代表大会的结果，不仅能鼓舞我们的党的斗争，为我们开辟新的远景和在我们向胜利前进道路上提供重要的经验，而且也会给各国人民的共同敌人——帝国主义——带来致命的打击。
    在我们祝贺中国共产党第八次代表大会获得巨大丰盛的成就时，我们以危地马拉全体共产党员的名义，向伟大的中国人民，向光荣的共产党，向你们英勇杰出的中央委员会以及向你们伟大的领袖毛泽东同志，再一次致以热烈的敬礼。
    争取和平、民主、民族独立和社会主义，伟大的中国革命万岁！
              危地马拉劳动党中央委员会
              一九五六年九月　危地马拉
