Respected Comrades:
    We extend to the Communist Party of China's important National Congress the warm, fraternal congratulations of the Communist Party of Chile and its Central Committee, and of the various democratic strata of our country.

    Your Congress, in making a summary with a high degree of creativity and in examining your work with profound criticism and self-criticism, has made a new contribution to the development of Marxism-Leninism, because it points out new paths for the revolutionary cause of the people of all countries.

    The reason you have been able to complete the First Five-Year Plan and discuss the Second Five-Year Plan is that, in the cause of your country's liberation, you have won over the peasant masses and the majority of the national bourgeoisie. All these people have formed a people's democratic united front based on the fundamental foundation of the worker-peasant alliance.

    Your Eighth Congress is of great significance to the people of our country, who are under the oppression of U.S. imperialism and feudal rule; it is a valuable contribution to the realization of the tasks stipulated in our national liberation policy.

    Our Party is applying Marxism-Leninism, absorbing your rich experience and the rich experience of the fraternal Communist Parties, as well as the historically significant struggles of the people of all countries for liberation, and using our strength to unite the broadest strata of our people. Our people, under the leadership of its working class and its vanguard party, are capable of defeating U.S. imperialism and their agents within our country, just as you did when you defeated them and expelled them forever from your land.

    The Communist Party of Chile is working according to this policy in all aspects of national life. After tremendous efforts, we have organized workers, clerks, and a portion of the peasants into a "United Workers' Confederation." This organization unites working people with extremely different political, philosophical, and religious tendencies, and is engaged in arduous struggles against all attempts at oppression and for the maintenance and expansion of democratic freedoms and trade union freedoms.

    With workers' unity and struggle as the center, we are gradually achieving political unity, and most importantly, the unity of action of the Socialist Party of Chile and the People's Socialist Party. These two parties are the foundation for gradually uniting other political forces such as the People's Democratic Party, the Chilean Democratic Party, and the Labor Party. We will form a People's Action Front with these parties, with a common struggle program that includes opposition to imperialism and feudalism. These parties are preparing a national conference aimed at organizationally and politically consolidating and strengthening this People's Action Front.

    The "People's Action Front" is fighting for the following goals:

    1.  Amnesty for all political persecutees; abolition of all repressive laws, especially the "Law for the Defense of Democracy!". Extensive democratization of the country.

    2.  Confiscation of raw material resources currently in the hands of American companies in our country.

    3.  Implementation of land reform.

    4.  Establishment of trade, cultural, and diplomatic relations with all countries in the world.

    The "United Workers' Confederation" and others who hope to change the balance of power in the country in order to implement the democratic reforms demanded by our people have included these goals as their own.

    For this reason, we attach great importance to the elections of senators and deputies to be held in 1957, as well as the election of the President of the Republic to be held in 1958. Although those repressive laws stipulate various clauses of political discrimination, if we Communists first do our job well, then these two elections can open up unprecedentedly broad prospects for the Chilean people in striving to achieve the goals of democracy and national liberation.

    People's forces are launching joint actions in the National Congress, in trade unions, among students, residents, female workers and housewives, and young people in general. These actions, sometimes on one or more common points, are expanding to other political forces, such as the National Falange Party, the Radical Party, and the progressive elements in the Conservative Party and the Liberal Party, which include a large part of the national bourgeoisie. Even those right-wing parties, although we have different views on many issues, we are fighting together with them for certain purposes, such as avoiding the violent dissolution of the National Congress and preventing the most reactionary and pro-imperialist elements from staging a coup.

    In our country, the working class and the people are currently engaged in an arduous struggle against an unprecedentedly severe crisis. Therefore, there have been many strikes, such as the strikes of nitrate workers, small miners, textile workers in El Salto and other textile factories, construction workers, metallurgical workers, official and semi-official employees, and private and national bank employees. They held strikes despite the government's violent suppression, some for twenty-four hours, others for weeks, even months.

    These trade union organizations and many other trade union organizations are also fighting against the government's implementation of economic plans that forcibly freeze prices, wages, and salaries, against these economic plans forced upon them by the American Klein-Saks consulting group, which in reality only froze wages and salaries, causing wages and salaries to decrease by fifty percent in one year compared to 1954.

    All these struggles, which belong to the nature of striving to meet urgent demands, and which target democratic freedom and trade union rights in their demands, are rising and are gradually defeating the policies of hunger and surrender being implemented in our country.

    Comrades, after the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which made great contributions to the cause of the people of all countries striving for independence, democracy, and peace, our party held its 10th National Congress, discussed and adopted a national program that is in line with the basic interests of all those concerned with the liberation struggle of our motherland. The Congress also approved the revision of our Party Constitution and the arguments for the possibility of a peaceful transition to socialism based on our country's specific conditions and circumstances. The Congress deemed it necessary to organize the peasants and fight for the satisfaction of their urgent demands, and to achieve a closer worker-peasant alliance in order to carry out a thorough land reform that would eliminate large landlord ownership and semi-feudal remnants.

    Another important conclusion reached by the 10th National Congress of our Party was the opposition to the cult of personality. In this regard, the Congress launched a struggle against sectarian and commandist working methods, the lack of more political training, the lack of more in-depth criticism and self-criticism of our work, and the lack of genuine collective work in the central leading organs, intermediate organs, grassroots organizations, and mass organizations.

    Delegates to the Congress:

    Comrades of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China: We should express our gratitude for your concerned and fraternal invitation to the Communist Party of Chile to attend your Congress. Through this historic Congress, we will be able to absorb much valuable knowledge and experience, so that we can move forward with more steadfast steps on the road to national liberation. We attach exceptional importance to these fraternal direct contacts with your great Party and the Chinese people.

    We would also like to point out that the visit of Chinese poets to Chile to celebrate Pablo Neruda's fiftieth birthday and the visit of the Chinese art troupe to our country have made significant contributions to strengthening the friendship between the people of our two countries. The Chinese art troupe was warmly welcomed by the Chilean people. Our Party, along with other progressive forces, has been actively working to establish trade, diplomatic, and cultural relations with the People's Republic of China. We firmly believe that these relations will be established in the short term, benefiting the people of both our countries.

    Comrades, we wish the discussions of the Congress the greatest success. It can be asserted that the resolutions of the Congress will make your socialist motherland even greater, and will once again provide instruction for the people of all countries in the world.

    Long live the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China!

    Long live the heroic, brave Chinese people!

    Long live the Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong!

    Long live the unity, peace, and friendship between the people of the world!

    Long live proletarian internationalism!

### 智利共产党代表致词

专栏：

    智利共产党代表致词敬爱的同志们：
    我们向中国共产党这次重要的全国代表大会转达智利共产党及其中央委员会和我国各民主阶层的热烈的兄弟般的祝贺。
    你们的大会，用高度的创造精神来作一次总结，并且用深刻的批评和自我批评来检查你们的工作的时候，对于马克思列宁主义的发展作出了新的贡献，因为它指出了各国人民的革命事业的新途径。
    你们所以能够完成第一个五年计划和讨论第二个五年计划，就是因为在你们的国家的解放事业中，你们争取到农民群众和大部分民族资产阶级。这一切人形成了建立在你们的成就的基本基础——工农联盟的基础上的人民民主统一战线。
    你们的第八次代表大会，对于正处在美帝国主义和封建统治压迫下的我国人民，具有非常重大的意义；对于实现我国民族解放政策中所规定的任务，是一个有价值的贡献。
    我们的党正在应用马克思列宁主义，吸取你们的和各兄弟共产党的丰富的经验，以及各国人民为争取解放而进行的具有历史意义的斗争的丰富的经验，把我们的力量用于团结我国人民最广泛的阶层。我国人民在它的工人阶级及其先锋政党的领导下，是能够击败美帝国主义和他们在我国内部的代理人的，正如你们在把他们击败并且永远地从你们的土地上逐出的时候所曾经作过的一样。
    智利共产党，在国家生活的各个方面，都是根据这个方针来工作的。经过巨大的努力以后，我们已经把工人、职员和一部分农民组织成一个“工人统一工会”。这个组织把具有极不相同的政治、哲学和宗教倾向的劳动人民团结在一起，并且为反对一切压迫的企图以及争取维护和扩大民主自由权利和工会的自由权利而进行着艰巨的斗争。
    我们以工人的统一和斗争为中心，逐渐取得政治上的统一，而最重要的是智利社会党和人民社会党的行动的统一。这两个党是逐渐团结人民民主党、智利民主党和劳工党等其他政治力量的基础。我们将和这些政党组成具有以反对帝国主义、封建主义为内容的共同的斗争纲领的人民行动阵线。这些政党正在筹备一个目的在于在组织上和政治上巩固和加强这个人民行动阵线的全国会议。
    “人民行动阵线”为下列的目标而斗争：
    1、大赦所有政治上受迫害者；废除一切镇压法律，特别是“保卫民主法！”。使国家广泛民主化。
    2、没收我国目前在美国公司手中的原料资源。
    3、实现土地改革。
    4、与世界上所有国家建立贸易、文化和外交关系。
    “工人统一工会”和其他方面希望改变国内力量对比以便实行我国人民要求的民主改革的人士，已经把这些目标列为自己的目标。
    因为这个缘故，我们很重视将在一九五七年举行的参议员和众议员的选举，以及将在一九五八年举行的共和国总统选举。尽管那些镇压法律规定了各种政治上歧视的条款，但如果我们共产党员首先把工作做好了，那么这两次选举就能为智利人民在争取达到民主和民族解放的目标开辟空前广阔的前途。
    人民力量正在国民大会里、在工会里、在学生、居民、女工和家庭主妇及一般青年当中展开共同行动，这些行动有时在一个或更多的共同点上正扩大到其他一些政治力量，如国家长枪党、激进党以及保守党和自由党中的进步成分，这些政治力量包括着民族资产阶级的大部分。甚至那些右翼党派，虽然我们和它们在许多问题上观点不同，但是在某些目的上我们和他们是一起斗争的，如避免国民大会被暴力解散，阻止最反动和亲帝的分子制造政变等。
    在我国，工人阶级和人民目前正在为反对空前严重的危机而进行着艰苦的斗争。因此发生了好多次的罢工，如硝石工人、小矿业、爱尔萨尔多的纺织工人以及其他纺织工厂的工人、营造业工人、冶金业工人、官方雇员和半官方雇员、私人和国家银行雇员罢工等。他们不顾政府的暴力镇压举行了罢工，有的为时二十四小时，有的长达几个星期、几个月。
    这些工会组织和其他许多工会组织也都为反对政府实施强制冻结物价、工资和薪金的经济计划而斗争，反对这些由美国克伦—萨克斯顾问团所强迫实施的经济计划，这些经济计划实际上只是冻结了工资和薪金，使工资和薪金在一年之间比一九五四年降低了百分之五十。
    所有这一切属于争取满足迫切要求性质的斗争，在他们的要求中都针对着民主自由和工会权利，这些斗争正日趋高涨，在逐步击败在我国实行的饥饿和投降的政策。
    同志们，对各国人民争取独立、民主和和平的事业作出了巨大贡献的苏联共产党第二十次代表大会召开以后，我们党举行了第十次全国代表大会，讨论并通过了一个全国纲领，这个纲领是符合一切关心我们祖国的解放斗争的各方面人士的基本利益的。大会还通过了我们党章的修改，通过了有可能根据我国具体情况和条件和平过渡到社会主义的论据。大会认为有必要把农民组织起来，为争取满足其迫切要求而斗争，为实现更紧密的工农联盟以进行消灭大地主占有制和半封建残余的彻底的土地改革而斗争。
    我们党的第十次全国代表大会所作出的另一个重要结论是反对个人崇拜。在这方面，大会针对着宗派主义和命令主义的工作方法，缺乏更多的政治锻炼，对我们的工作缺乏比较深入的批评和自我批评的现象，以及在中央领导机关、中级机关、基层组织和群众组织中没有真正的集体工作等现象，展开了斗争。
    大会的代表同志们：
    中国共产党中央委员会的同志们：我们应该对你们关切地、兄弟般地邀请智利共产党出席你们的大会表示感谢。通过这个具有历史意义的大会，我们将能吸取许多宝贵的知识和经验，使我们在民族解放的道路上能够以更加坚定的步伐向前迈进。我们异常重视这些同你们伟大的党和中国人民的兄弟般的直接联系。
    我们还想指出，中国诗人到智利庆祝巴勃罗·聂鲁达的五十寿辰和中国艺术团来我国的访问，对加强我们两国人民之间的友谊所作出的重大的贡献。中国艺术团曾经受到智利人民的热烈欢迎。我们的党和其他进步力量一起已在积极努力，争取同中华人民共和国建立贸易、外交和文化等方面的关系。我们坚信，这些关系将在短期内建立起来，使我们两国人民都得到好处。
    同志们，我们谨祝大会的讨论获得最大的成功。可以断定，大会的决议将使你们社会主义祖国更加伟大，将使世界各国人民又一次获得教益。
    中国共产党第八次全国代表大会万岁！
    英雄的、勇敢的中国人民万岁！
    以毛泽东同志为首的中央委员会万岁！
    全世界人民之间的团结、和平、友谊万岁！
    无产阶级国际主义万岁！
