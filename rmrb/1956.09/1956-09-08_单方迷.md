    Single-Remedy Obsession
    Yun Lin
    On August 28th, the People's Daily published two letters from readers on page seven, raising questions about using tadpoles for contraception. The very next day, the "Science Window" section of the Zhejiang Daily published an article entitled "Introducing Several Single-Remedy Contraceptives," the first single-remedy being the tadpole one, and increased to swallowing dozens or "nearly a hundred" live tadpoles. Putting the two newspapers together creates an amusing contrast; especially the words "Science Window" in the Zhejiang Daily stand out prominently.
    Traditional Chinese medicine and herbs are a valuable heritage that we should study, organize, and promote. This is self-evident and beyond doubt. Traditional Chinese medicine can indeed cure some diseases that Western medicine cannot, and many folk remedies are indeed very effective. However, although there are many single-remedies, probably less than a few percent are truly effective. Moreover, all effective single-remedies have a scientific basis, and can be scientifically tested and concluded. The single-remedy of swallowing twenty or more live tadpoles for five years of contraception does not meet these conditions. It is inappropriate to easily label it "scientific" and promote it widely in newspapers.
    Recently, everyone seems a bit obsessed with single-remedies. As long as a certain traditional Chinese medicine doctor comes up with a single-remedy, or a family secret recipe is revealed, regardless of the content, efficacy, scientific basis, side effects, or risks, it is immediately labeled "scientific," exaggeratedly promoted, and widely introduced. And people don't like to offer opinions, and others are afraid to offer opinions, fearing being labeled as "opposing traditional Chinese medicine" or holding "bourgeois decadent thoughts," and so on.
    Because I was often sick when I was young, I dabbled in some traditional Chinese medicine books and read books on Chinese herbal medicine such as "Compendium of Materia Medica," and I understand a little about the theory of traditional Chinese medicine and the properties of some Chinese herbs. Recently, I saw an introduction in "China Youth" to a single-remedy for turning white hair black (of course, again from a certain traditional Chinese medicine doctor), using only Rehmannia glutinosa (soaked in wine) and Polygonum multiflorum, brewed with boiling water, taken daily, and effective after more than half a year. I am over half a century old, my teeth have not fallen out but my hair is already gray. As soon as I saw this single-remedy, I blamed myself: haven't you seen in medical books that cooked Rehmannia glutinosa can "blacken the beard and hair," and Polygonum multiflorum is said to be called "Shou Wu" (head black) because it can "darken the beard and hair"? Why didn't you think of using these two herbs to prevent white hair earlier, and instead allowed it to develop from "frost at the temples" to "a head of snow" in four or five years? I comforted myself by saying: it's okay, it's not too late, as long as I take the medicine according to this single-remedy, after half a year, won't I have a head of black hair and be young again? But then I saw a supplementary explanation from the traditional Chinese medicine doctor who made this single-remedy public, saying that people over sixty years old and pregnant women should not take this single-remedy. I am unfortunately nearly sixty years old. Although I may not necessarily need to avoid taking it, I am afraid that taking it will not have any effect, right? Thinking of this, I felt lost and very sad again.
    The problem still lies in whether this single-remedy has a scientific basis. Literature recording Chinese medicine consistently considers Rehmannia glutinosa to be a medicine for "nourishing blood and nourishing yin," and Polygonum multiflorum, in addition to "darkening the beard and hair," is also a good tonic, and can "make people have children," so why should people over sixty years old and pregnant women avoid taking it? Well, now we don't need to argue too much. Fortunately, this single-remedy only needs half a year to experiment. I hope that after half a year, there will indeed be many comrades with white hair under the age of sixty who have turned into black-haired comrades because they took the medicine according to this single-remedy. Then everything I said above will be nonsense, and I am willing to make a pleasant self-criticism.
    But there is still a problem, and the problem lies in the word "obsession." I think that collecting folk remedies and making family secret recipes public, publishing them in medical publications, or printing them into collections like "New Compilation of Effective Prescriptions," for doctors and medical researchers to experiment and research, is very necessary. But before the experiments and research have reached a conclusion, it is absolutely inappropriate to promote them widely in newspapers and periodicals (especially in publications like "China Youth" for young people), letting people try them blindly, because some single-remedies may have side effects or have certain risks, and cannot be tried casually. Regardless of the actual efficacy of the prescription, as long as it is said by a certain traditional Chinese medicine doctor, as long as it is a single-remedy or secret recipe, it is treated as a treasure and promoted widely. That is "obsession." Being obsessed with something is always bad, whether it is superstition, bewilderment, or addiction, stubbornness, none of these are scientific attitudes, violating the spirit of the era of advancing towards science.

    单方迷
    云林
    8月28日人民日报第七版发表了两封读者来信，对吃蝌蚪避孕问题提出了疑问，就在下一天，浙江日报的“科学窗”里刊载了一篇“介绍几个避孕单方”的文章，第一个单方就是那个吞蝌蚪的单方，而且增加到可以活吞几十条或者“将近一百条”了。两张报纸放在一起，相映成趣；尤其浙江日报的“科学窗”三个字显得非常突出。
    中医和中药是咱们一份宝贵的遗产，应该加以研究、整理和发扬，这是天经地义，不容怀疑的。中医的确能够医好若干种西医医不好的病，许多流传在民间的单方也的确有非常灵验的。但是单方虽然多，真正灵验的怕不到百分之几吧；而且凡是灵验的单方都有科学根据，都可以进行科学的检验，作出科学的结论来的。像吞二十多条活蝌蚪可以避孕五年的那个单方就没有具备这些条件，轻易给它贴上“科学”的标签，在报纸上大事宣传，是很不妥当的。
    近来大家似乎有点单方迷了，只要是某某中医师说出来的单方或者公开出来的祖传秘方，不问内容如何，疗效如何，有无科学根据，有无副作用或危险性，一律贴上“科学”的标签，加以夸张的宣传和广泛的介绍，而且不大喜欢人家提意见，人家也不敢提意见，怕给扣上“反对中医”或“资产阶级腐朽思想”等等的大帽子。
    我因为年轻时候多病，曾经涉猎过一些中医书，也看过“本草纲目”之类的中药书，懂得一点中医的理论和若干味中药的性能。最近看到“中国青年”上介绍一个白发变黑的单方（当然又是某某中医师说出来的），只用生地黄（酒浸）、何首乌两味药，开水泡，每天服，连服半年以上就见效。我年过半百，齿未摇落而发已苍苍，一看到这个单方，就自己责备自己：你不是在药书上看到过熟地黄可以“黑须发”，而何首乌据说就是因为可以“乌髭发”才有“首乌”之称的吗？你为什么不早早想到用这两味药来防止头发白，而竟在四五年之内从“两鬓霜”发展到“满头雪”呢？我又安慰自己说：不要紧，还来得及，只要照这个单方服药，半年以后，我不又是满头乌发，翩翩年少了吗？但是后来又看到公开这个单方的那位中医师的补充说明，说年过六十岁的和怀孕的人忌服这个单方。我不幸年近六十，虽然不一定要忌服，恐怕吃下去也不见得有什么效用了吧？想到这里，又怅然自失，十分悲哀了。
    问题还在于这个单方有无科学根据这一点上。记载中药的文献一致认为地黄是“养血滋阴”之药，而何首乌除了“乌髭发”，还是一种滋补良药，而且可以“令人有子”，那么为什么年过六十的人和孕妇又要忌服呢？好了，现在我们不必多争论，好在这个单方要实验也只需半年，希望半年以后确有不少六十岁以内的白发同志因为照这个单方服药而变为黑发同志，那么我上面说的全成了废话，我愿意作一次愉快的自我检讨。
    但是还有问题，问题就在于这个“迷”字上。我想，把流传民间的单方搜集起来，把祖传的秘方公开出来，登载在医药刊物上，或者印成像“验方新编”之类的集子，供医师和医学研究者们的试验和研究，那是非常必要的。但在试验和研究没有得出结论以前，万万不宜在报纸和刊物上（尤其像给青年看的“中国青年”之类）大事宣传，让人家去盲目尝试，因为有些单方可能有副作用或者有某种危险性，不可以随便尝试的。不问那个方子的实际疗效怎么样，只要是某某中医师说出来的，只要是单方或秘方，就如获至宝，大事宣传，那是“迷”。对某种事物一着迷总是不好的，不管是迷信、迷惑或者沉迷、执迷，都不是科学态度，违反向科学进军的时代精神的。
