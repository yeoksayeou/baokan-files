Yunnan Discovers Rubber Vine

(Our dispatch) Yunnan Province has discovered a type of rubber substitute with abundant resources: vine rubber. Vine rubber is the latex extracted from the rubber vine. According to tests by the South China Tropical Crops Research Institute, it contains 85.17% rubber and can be used as a raw material for rubber shoes, water bags, and general daily-use rubber products. Experiments by the Kunming Wire Factory have also proven that it can completely replace imported Brazilian rubber, while the cost is only half that of Brazilian rubber. The Yunnan Provincial Trading Company conducted a comprehensive survey throughout the province and found that this type of rubber vine is widely distributed. Wherever there are subtropical climates with moist, shady mountains, rubber vines grow abundantly. A rubber vine with a diameter of about four inches can yield seven liang (approximately 350 grams) of latex at a time and can be tapped two to three times a year. Many counties in southern Yunnan Province can produce tens of thousands of such rubber vines per county. Rubber vine is easy to plant; any cut section stuck in the ground will take root. However, its bark is tougher than that of rubber trees, making tapping more difficult. The Yunnan Provincial Trading Company is currently researching improvements to address this.

    云南发现橡胶藤
    本报讯　云南省发现一种资源很丰富的橡胶代用品——藤胶。藤胶是橡胶藤上割下来的胶，据华南热带作物科学研究所的化验，其中含有橡胶85.17％，可作胶鞋、水袋和一般日用的橡胶制品的原料；昆明电线厂的试验也证明了完全可以代替进口的巴西橡胶，而成本只有巴西橡胶的一半。云南省贸易公司在全省范围内进行了普遍的调查，发现此种橡胶藤分布极广，凡属亚热带气候的潮湿阴凉的山岳中，几乎都有橡胶藤丛生着。一株直径四吋左右的橡胶藤一次可割胶七公两，一年可割两次到三次。云南省南部的许多县份，每县可产上万株这样的橡胶藤。橡胶藤种植方便，任意割一截插在地上就能活，只是它的皮比橡树皮老，割胶比较麻烦，云南省贸易公司正在研究改进中。
