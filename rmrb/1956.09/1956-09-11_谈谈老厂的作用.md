Discussing the Role of Old Factories
　　Jiang Yiwei
    After the central government put forward the policy of making full use of the coastal industrial base, the correct estimation of the role of old factories has become a matter of concern to everyone. Now I would like to talk about some views on this issue based on the situation in the machinery industry.
    China's original machinery industry foundation was very weak: small in scale, incomplete in industry, and backward in technology. To fundamentally change this backward situation, it is necessary to build new factories, especially a group of large-scale, technologically brand-new key factories, as the backbone of various industries; otherwise, it will be impossible to transfer the machinery industry to the track of new technology. Therefore, in the past, we adopted the policy of concentrating the use of funds to ensure the construction of new factories, especially key factories. This approach should be said to be correct and necessary.
    However, what attitude should be taken towards the existing old factories? What position should old factories be placed in? In the past, we also generally emphasized the important role of old factories in industrial development, but in fact, the understanding was insufficient. Insufficient understanding of the role of old factories is mainly manifested in two aspects: first, only the role of old factories in current production was emphasized, and not enough attention was paid to the important role they play in developing production and building new factories; on the other hand, the old factories were intentionally or unintentionally regarded as something immutable, and they were not regarded as an organic whole that can and must be continuously developed and progressed. Due to the lack of understanding in these two aspects, in the past, we generally did not pay enough attention to the development of old factories. After several years of practice in implementing the first five-year plan, we gradually realized that the role of old factories must be re-evaluated.
    From the perspective of production, old factories were not only the main force in the first five-year plan period, but they will still be the main force in the second five-year plan period. This is because it takes several years for a new factory to go from construction to production and to fully utilize its design capacity. Taking the First Ministry of Machine Building as an example, only 24% of the new factories built during the first five-year plan period were put into production during the first five-year plan period, 50% will be put into production in the early stage of the second five-year plan, and 26% will not be put into production until the middle stage of the second five-year plan. Therefore, approximately 80% of the total output value expected to be achieved during the first five-year plan period will be borne by old factories; in the second five-year plan period, it is preliminarily estimated that a large part of the output value will still be completed by leveraging the role of existing old factories. This is an important aspect of the role of old factories. However, it is not enough to make such an analysis, and such an analysis will also give people an inappropriate concept: it seems that old factories only have an important role before a large number of new factories have been built, and when more new factories are built, the role of old factories will not be great. Under the guidance of this concept, people often hold a negative attitude towards the future of old factories, thus greatly hindering the consideration of fully leveraging the role of old factories.
    Years of experience have shown that old factories are not only the main force in meeting the country's current needs, but more importantly, they are also the base for supporting new factories.
    Building a new factory requires a large amount of capital. A large part of the country's construction funds is accumulated by old factories. Taking the First Ministry of Machine Building as an example, the profits turned over by enterprises stipulated in the first five-year plan are equivalent to 46.5% of the state's investment in the construction of this ministry.
    Building new factories requires a large number of mechanical equipment. This equipment should be supplied by existing mechanical industry enterprises. Currently, limited by the production capacity and technical level of old factories, many large and precision equipment still need to be imported from abroad. However, 60% to 70% of the equipment needed for national construction has been supplied by existing old factories; about 50% of the equipment for new factories designed by the Soviet Union has also been supplied by existing machinery factories in China. Taking the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant as an example, domestic supply accounts for 55% of the nearly 10,000 sets of process equipment in the entire plant; 56% of the factories of the First Ministry of Machine Building and many machinery factories led by local industrial departments have undertaken the task of manufacturing.
    Building new factories also requires a large number of cadres and skilled workers. In addition to a portion trained by schools, most of these cadres and workers are transferred from old factories. In the past, in the process of building new factories, a large number of cadres were transferred from local areas and the armed forces; in the future, this source will not be large, which will further increase the burden on old factories. Existing old factories must train a large number of cadres and skilled workers for new factories in a relatively short period of time. At the same time, the scale of new factories is generally larger than that of old factories, and the technology is also more advanced. Therefore, the requirements for the business and technical level of the personnel required are high. This is a very arduous task for old factories.
    In addition, many new factory products require the cooperation of many old factories. Taking the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant as an example, it requires 410 kinds of cooperative products, with a value accounting for about one-third of the unit price of automobiles. These cooperative products are to be supplied by other factories. There are 42 cooperating units, of which 40 are old factories. The technical requirements for automobiles are very high. In order to mass-produce cooperative products that meet these requirements, 22 of the 40 cooperating old factories must be expanded, and other factories also need to carry out certain technical transformations.
    From the above aspects, it can be clearly seen the important role of old factories in supporting new factories. To truly leverage these roles, it is impossible for old factories to not carry out a certain degree of transformation. The mechanical equipment required by new factories is all modern, and it is impossible for old factories to undertake the manufacturing if their technical level is not improved; the number of personnel required by new factories is not only large, but also has high level requirements, and it is difficult for old factories to train qualified personnel for new factories if they do not appropriately expand and improve their technical and organizational level; producing cooperative products for new factories also requires old factories to correspondingly improve their technical level. Therefore, we can say that without properly developing old factories as a base, the construction of new factories cannot be carried out smoothly.
    Most of the existing old factories in the machinery industry were left over from before liberation. The technical foundation is generally very backward: some factory buildings are very dilapidated, the distribution of workshops is unreasonable, the production area is unbalanced, the equipment is old or incomplete, the arrangement of production lines is unreasonable, the ability of tool manufacturing and machine repair is excessively weak, and there is a lack of necessary testing institutions and inspection equipment, etc. This greatly limits the improvement of the production capacity and manufacturing level of old factories. If appropriate improvements are made in these aspects, and organizational management is improved at the same time, old factories can unleash great potential.
    According to relevant calculations, the economic benefits obtained from transforming old factories are often much greater than building new factories, and the time is faster. For example, the Shanghai Boiler Factory carried out a renovation from 1954 to 1956, and its production capacity has been greatly improved; according to current calculations, if another investment of more than 10 million yuan is made, the production capacity can be increased by another 1.5 times. Another example is the Guangzhou General Machinery Factory, which increased its output by 83% by investing 3.8 million yuan in renovation. There are many examples of this kind. These facts raise a question for us: when we consider meeting the country's needs, should we first consider building new factories, or should we first consider utilizing old factories? From the perspective of economic benefits, if old factories can be utilized, it is undoubtedly much more beneficial than building new factories. And appropriately expanding the scale of old factories and improving the technical level of old factories are indispensable conditions for supporting the construction of new factories.
    In the past, when we talked about old factories, we always referred to factories left over from before liberation. This is also a narrow concept. With the successive completion of new factories, the meaning of old factories is changing. Those newly built factories have joined the ranks of old factories. These factories should not be viewed with an "immutable" perspective either. This is because: first of all, technology is constantly developing and progressing. Although a new factory adopts new technologies as much as possible during design, after it is built, its technical level needs to be further improved due to the emergence of newer technologies; secondly, although these factories have undergone scientific calculations during design, many potentials will still be discovered after production practice. As long as appropriate adjustments and transformations are made organizationally and technically, these factories, like other old factories, can further unleash greater economic benefits. The same is true for renovated old factories. With the development of production, by taking some necessary technical and organizational measures, or carrying out a second renovation, these factories can also unleash greater potential. For example, the newly renovated Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Factory was originally designed to produce 13 types of pneumatic tools with a total of 20,000 units per year; after this factory adopted measures such as organizing assembly lines last year, its production capacity rapidly increased, and it has now reached 40,000 units per year.
    Many of the existing mechanical industry enterprises are in a condition to be expanded. These enterprises can multiply their production capacity, or increase the variety and improve the quality of products, with only a small amount of investment. These enterprises should be utilized as much as possible according to the needs of the country. However, not all old factories are in a condition to be expanded, nor is it necessary for all old factories to be expanded. Old factories that are not expanded, due to their long-term accumulation of technical experience in the specialized manufacturing of certain products, and due to continuous technical transformation with the progress of technology, can still become technologically advanced factories. There are many old factories in the Soviet Union, such as the famous Red Proletarian Factory, the Leningrad Power Factory, the Ural Heavy Machinery Factory, and the Stalin Automobile Factory, whose scale is not repeatedly expanded, but their technology has always been at the forefront, becoming the technical leading factories in their respective industries. Among the existing machinery factories in China, many factories have also embarked on the road of independent technical development, such as the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory and the Shanghai Steam Turbine Factory. These factories are also likely to become the technical leading factories in their respective industries. There are also some small-scale old factories, which, even if they are not expanded, can develop into specialized factories with certain characteristics under the rational division of labor in the entire machinery industry. For example, factories specializing in the production of oil pumps and nozzles, factories specializing in the production of piston rings and spark plugs, can be small in scale, but their technical level can be very high. This type of specialized factory should be regarded as an important part of the modern machinery industry.
    Based on the above situations, we can draw the following conclusions: Existing enterprises, including old factories left over from before liberation and factories newly built and renovated after liberation, can and should continue to develop; the scale does not necessarily have to be expanded, but the technical level must be continuously improved. In this way, they can not only become the main force in meeting current needs, but also become the base for building new factories. Therefore, the construction policy of the machinery industry should be to consider building new factories on the basis of fully developing existing enterprises; as long as the transformation of existing factories can meet the needs of the country, existing factories should be fully utilized. In terms of investment allocation, a considerable proportion should also be allocated to develop existing factories. In the past, due to insufficient understanding of the role of old factories, excessive reduction of investment in old factories in the implementation of the policy of focusing on the use of investment was inappropriate in retrospect.
    However, when analyzing the role of old factories, we must also see that there are certain limits to leveraging the role of old factories. The transformation of old factories is always subject to certain limitations of the original foundation. If the original foundation of old factories is completely overturned and too much investment is made, the result is equivalent to building new factories, and whether it is economically beneficial is worth studying. Building new factories can be carried out without any old constraints, and can be constructed entirely in accordance with the latest technological achievements and rational organizational layout; its advancement and integrity in technology and organization are entirely possible to greatly exceed the level of existing old factories, and become a model for the transformation of similar old factories. At the same time, due to the limitations of the original foundation of old factories, the manufacturing of many special large and precision products cannot be met only by carrying out technical transformations in old factories. The establishment of certain new industrial sectors must also build new factories. Therefore, building new factories is still the most important way to fundamentally change the backwardness of the machinery industry. When we correct the tendency of underestimating the role of old factories, we must also prevent the tendency of overestimating and blindly developing them. If the needs and possibilities are not considered, and all old factories are required to expand their scale; or if there is no rational division of labor and cooperation, and all factories are required to develop into leading factories; or if the original foundation is discarded at will, and everything is updated; or if equipment is blindly supplemented and new technologies are blindly adopted; these practices are inconsistent with the basic spirit of fully leveraging the role of existing enterprises, and the result will only lead to various unreasonable phenomena such as product duplication, waste of funds, and further imbalance in the development of production capacity and departments. These will bring many undue economic losses. Therefore, it is necessary to estimate the role of old factories realistically, neither diminishing nor exaggerating them.

    谈谈老厂的作用
  　蒋一苇
    中央提出充分利用沿海工业基地的方针之后，对老厂作用的正确估计问题，成为大家都很关心的一个问题。现在我想根据机械工业方面的情况，谈一些对这个问题的看法。
    我国机械工业的原有基础十分薄弱：规模小，行业不全，技术落后。要从根本上改变这种落后状况，必须建设新厂，特别是要建设一批规模大的、技术全新的重点厂，作为各个行业的骨干，否则，要把机械工业转移到新技术的轨道上去是不可能的。因此，过去我们采取了集中使用资金的方针，保证了新厂，特别是重点厂的建设。这种做法，应该说是正确的，也是必要的。
    但是，对待现有的老厂应当采取什么态度呢？应当把老厂放在一个什么样的位置上呢？过去我们也曾一般地强调了老厂在工业发展中的重要作用，但是实际上认识是不足的。对老厂作用认识不足，主要表现在两个方面：一是只强调了老厂对当前生产的作用，没有足够地看到它对发展生产以及建设新厂所起的重要作用；另一方面是有意无意地把老厂看做是一个一成不变的东西，没有把它看做是一个可以、而且必须不断发展进步的有机体。由于在这两方面认识不足，过去我们对老厂的发展问题一般是注意得不够的。经过这几年执行第一个五年计划的实践，才逐渐体会到对老厂的作用必须重新加以估计。
    从生产上看，老厂不仅在第一个五年计划时期是主力，在第二个五年计划时期，它仍然是主力。这是因为一个新厂从建设到投入生产，发挥设计能力，要经过好几年的时间。以第一机械工业部来说，在第一个五年计划期中建设的新厂，只有24％在第一个五年计划期间投入生产，50％要在第二个五年计划的初期投入生产，26％要在第二个五年计划的中期才能投入生产。因此，第一个五年计划期间预计达到的生产总值，约80％要靠老厂来担负；在第二个五年计划期中，初步预计，很大一部分产值也仍然要靠发挥现有老厂的作用来完成。这是老厂作用的一个重要方面。但是，仅仅作这样的分析是不够的，而且这样的分析还会给人们一个不大恰当的概念：似乎老厂只是在新厂还没有大量建成以前有重要作用，等到新厂建起来的多了，老厂也就作用不大了。在这样一种观念的指导下，对老厂的前途往往会抱着一种消极的态度，因而大大阻碍了对充分发挥老厂作用的考虑。
    几年来的经验说明，老厂不仅是满足国家当前需要的主力，更重要的，它还是支援新厂的基地。
    建设一个新厂，需要一大笔资金。国家的建设资金，很大一部分是靠老厂来积累的。以第一机械工业部来说，第一个五年计划中规定的企业上缴利润，就相当于国家对这个部建设投资的46.5％。
    建设新厂，需要大批的机械设备。这些设备是应当由现有的机械工业企业来供应的。目前限于老厂的生产能力和技术水平，许多大型的、精密的设备还要靠国外进口。但是，全国建设所需要的设备60％到70％已经是由现有老厂来供应；苏联设计的新厂，50％左右的设备也已经由我国现有机械工厂来供应了。拿第一汽车制造厂为例，全厂将近一万台（套）工艺用的设备，由国内供应的就占55％；第一机械工业部的56％的工厂和许多地方工业部门领导的机械工厂，都担负了承制的任务。
    建设新厂还需要大批的干部和熟练工人。这些干部和工人，除了由学校培养一部分以外，大部分要从老厂抽调。过去在建设新厂的过程中，从地方和部队上转业来了大批干部；今后这个来源不大了，这就更加重了老厂的担子。现有老厂必须在相当短的时间内，为新厂培养出大批干部和熟练工人。同时，新厂的规模一般比老厂要大，技术也先进，因此，所需要的人员，业务和技术水平的要求都是高的。这对老厂来说，是一个十分艰巨的任务。
    此外，不少新厂的产品需要很多老厂的协作。拿第一汽车制造厂来说，它就需要四百一十种协作产品，价值约占汽车单价的三分之一。这些协作产品是要由其他厂来供应的。协作的单位有四十二个，其中四十个是老厂。汽车的技术要求很高，为了大量生产合乎这种要求的协作产品，四十个协作老厂中有二十二个必须进行扩建，其他厂也需要进行一定的技术改造。
    从以上这几个方面，可以明显地看出老厂对支援新厂的重要作用。要真正发挥这些作用，老厂本身不进行一定程度的改造是不行的。新厂所需要的机械装备都是现代化的，老厂的技术水平不提高就不可能承制；新厂需要的人员不仅数量大，而且水平要求高，老厂本身如果不适当扩大，技术和组织水平如果不提高，就很难为新厂培养出合乎要求的人员来；为新厂生产协作产品，也需要老厂相应地提高技术水平。因此，我们可以这样说，不适当地发展老厂这个基地，也就不能顺利地进行新厂的建设。
    机械工业的现有老厂，多数是解放以前遗留下来的。技术基础一般很落后：厂房有的很破旧，车间的分布不合理，生产面积不平衡，设备陈旧或者不成套，生产线的排列不合理，工具制造和机修的能力过分薄弱，缺乏必要的试验机构和检验设备等等。这就大大限制了老厂生产能力和制造水平的提高。如果在这些方面进行适当的改进，同时对组织管理工作加以改善，老厂就能发挥出很大的潜力。
    据有关方面计算，改造老厂得到的经济效果，往往比建设新厂要大得多，而且时间要快。例如，上海锅炉厂在1954年到1956年进行了一次改建，生产能力提高很多；根据目前计算，如再投资一千多万元，就能使生产能力再提高一倍半。又如广州通用机器厂，投资三百八十万元进行改建，就使产量提高了83％。这一类的例子是很多的。这些事实向我们提出了一个问题：当我们考虑满足国家需要的时候，应该首先考虑建设新厂呢，还是首先考虑利用老厂？从经济效果来看，如果能够利用老厂，无疑地比建设新厂要有利得多。而适当扩大老厂的规模，提高老厂的技术水平，又是支援新厂建设所不可缺少的条件。
    过去我们一说老厂，总是指的解放以前遗留下来的厂子。这也是一个狭隘的观念。随着新厂的陆续建成，老厂的含义正在发生变化。那些新建成的厂子，已经加入到老厂的队伍中来了。对这些厂，也不能用一种“一成不变”的眼光来看它们。这是因为：首先，技术是不断在发展进步的，一个新厂在设计的时候虽然尽可能采用了新技术，但是在建成以后，由于更新的技术出现了，这些厂的技术水平也就需要进一步提高；其次，这些厂虽然在设计的时候经过了科学的计算，但是经过生产的实践以后，也仍然会发现许多潜力。只要从组织上和技术上加以适当地调整、改造，这些厂也会和其他老厂一样，可以进一步发挥出更大的经济效果。经过改建的老厂也是这样。随着生产的发展，采取一些必要的技术组织措施，或者进行第二次改建，这些厂也都能发挥出更大的潜力来。例如新改建的沈阳风动工具厂，原设计能力是年产十三种风动工具，共二万台；这个厂在去年采取了组织流水生产线等措施以后，生产能力迅速提高，现在已经达到年产四万台。
    现有的机械工业企业，不少是有条件进行扩建的。这类企业只要给以少量投资，就能成倍地提高生产能力，或者增加品种，提高产品质量。这类企业应当根据国家的需要，尽量加以利用。但是，不是所有老厂都有条件扩建，也不是所有老厂都有必要扩建。不扩建的老厂，由于在某种产品的专业制造上长期积累了技术经验，由于随着技术的进步，不断进行技术改造，也仍然可以成为一个技术先进的工厂。苏联就有不少老厂，如著名的红色无产者工厂、列宁格勒电力工厂、乌拉尔重型机器厂、斯大林汽车厂等，规模并不一再扩大，但是技术始终走在前面，成为所在行业的技术主导厂。我国现有机械工厂中，也有不少厂已经走上技术独立发展的道路，如上海机床厂、上海汽轮机厂等。这些工厂同样可能成为它所在行业的技术主导厂。还有一些规模较小的老厂，即使不扩建，在整个机械工业的合理分工之下，也可以发展成为一些具有某种特长的专业化工厂。例如专门生产油泵、油嘴、专门生产活塞环、火花塞等的工厂，规模可以不大，技术水平却可以很高。这类专业化的工厂，应当看作是现代化的机械工业的重要组成部分。
    根据以上这些情况，我们可以得出如下的结论：现有企业，包括解放以前遗留下来的老厂和解放以后新建、改建的工厂，都是可以、而且应该不断地有所发展的；规模不一定都要扩大，但是技术水平必须不断地提高。这样，它们便可以不仅成为满足当前需要的主力，而且成为建设新厂的基地。因此，机械工业的建设方针，应当是在充分发展现有企业的基础上来考虑建设新厂；只要改造现有厂能够满足国家的需要，就应当充分利用现有厂。在投资的分配上，也应当拿出相当的比重来发展现有厂。过去由于对老厂作用认识不足，在执行重点使用投资的方针上，过多地削减老厂投资，现在看来是不恰当的。
    但是，在分析老厂作用的时候，我们也必须看到发挥老厂作用也有一定的限度。老厂的改造，总要受到原有基础的一定限制，如果把老厂的原有基础全部推翻，投资过多，结果等于新建，在经济效果上是否有利，就值得研究了。建设新厂可以没有任何旧的羁绊，完全按照最新的技术成就和合理的组织布置进行建设；它在技术和组织上的先进性和完整性，完全可能大大超过现有老厂的水平，而成为同类老厂进行改造的样板。同时，由于老厂受原有基础的限制，许多特殊大型和精密产品的制造，仅仅靠老厂进行技术改造是不能满足要求的。某些新的工业部门的建立，也必须建设新厂。因此，建设新厂仍然是从根本上改变机械工业落后面貌的最重要的途径。我们在纠正对老厂作用估计过低的偏向的时候，也要防止过高估计和盲目发展的偏向。如果不考虑需要和可能，要求所有老厂都扩大规模；或者不进行合理的专业分工与协作，要求所有厂都发展成主导厂；或者是随便丢弃原有的基础，一切更新；或者盲目补充设备，盲目采用新技术；这些做法都和充分发挥现有企业作用的基本精神不一致，其结果只会造成产品重复、资金浪费，以及生产能力和部门的发展更加不平衡等各种不合理的现象。这些都会带来经济上的许多不应有的损失。因此，既不缩小，也不夸大，实事求是地估计老厂的作用是十分必要的。
