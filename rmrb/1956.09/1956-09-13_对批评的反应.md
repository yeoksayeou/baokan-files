    Reactions to Criticism
    I agree with the criticism of me in the article "Why is Appealing Not Allowed?" on page 4 of the People's Daily on July 13th. Appealing is a legal right of the parties involved. My failure to process the appeal procedures for the defendant on time is a serious violation of the law. This criticism is a very good education for me. However, some individual facts have some discrepancies and need to be explained. For example, the article mentioned that a comrade surnamed Li from the court said: "Execute immediately after the verdict is pronounced, to be quick, and consider the case closed; as for appealing, if there's no appeal, we save ourselves a second effort." I am the only person surnamed Li in the court, but I never said such a thing.

    After the People's Daily published the mass appeal "Should Not Bully Commune Members" on page 4 on August 23rd, we dealt with the issue of Han Lihua, the security chief of the Splendor Agricultural Production Cooperative, and others beating commune member Dai Mingzhi. It was decided to give Han Lihua, who seriously violated human rights, a warning within the Party, and it was suggested that he be removed from his position as deputy leader of the township militia in administration. He is fully responsible for Dai Mingzhi's medical expenses and will appropriately compensate for some of his work points. Although statistician Dai Shifu did not personally beat anyone, he encouraged Han's beating behavior. In addition to making a profound self-criticism, he must also compensate Dai Mingzhi for some work points. Production Captain Dai Desheng did not stop this from happening and must also make a profound self-criticism.

    On July 24th, your newspaper published an article "Strange Welfare Undertakings," criticizing our bureau for using welfare funds to purchase tonics, and the problem of everyone taking tonics. This criticism is consistent with the facts. We sincerely accept your criticism and guarantee to use welfare funds reasonably in the future.

    对批评的反应
    我同意7月13日人民日报第四版“为什么不许上诉”一文对我的批评。上诉是当事人的合法权利，我没有按时给被告办理上诉手续，这是一种严重的违法行为。这个批评，对我是一次很好的教育。但是，个别事实，有些出入，是需要说明的，如文中提到法院一个姓李的同志说过：“宣判完了就执行，痛快些，算是办完了一件案子；上诉再说，不上诉就省着费二遍事了。”法院就是我一个人姓李，但我并没有说过这样的话。

    人民日报8月23日第四版发表了“不该欺压社员”的群众呼声后，我们对辉煌农业生产合作社保卫股长韩立华等殴打社员代明志的问题，进行了处理。决定给严重侵犯了人权的韩立华以党内警告处分，建议行政上撤销其乡武装队副队长的职务，代明志看病的医药费由他全部负责并酌情赔偿劳动工分一部分。统计员代世福虽未亲自动手打人，但鼓励了韩的打人行为，除作深刻检讨外，还要包赔代明志一部分工分。生产队长代德胜对这事不加制止，也要作深刻检讨。

    7月24日你报刊出“古怪的福利事业”一文，批评我局用福利费购买补药，而且人人吃补药的问题，这一批评是符合事实的，我们诚恳接受你们的批评，并保证今后合理使用福利费。
