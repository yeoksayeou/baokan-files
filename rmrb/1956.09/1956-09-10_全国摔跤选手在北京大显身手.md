    全国摔跤选手在北京大显身手
    据新华社9日讯　一百多名包括十一个民族的优秀摔跤选手，今天在1956年全国摔跤锦标赛中大显身手。
    在今天的比赛中，观众最感兴趣的是重量级的比赛。参加这一级比赛的运动员体重都在82.5公斤以上。1953年重量级摔跤全国冠军僧格（蒙古族）和年轻力壮的北京市二十二岁的工人重量级摔跤选手杨宝和，今天在同他们的对手比赛时，都占了绝对优势。高大的张魁元乘阿不力孜的疏忽，把他摔倒了。阿不力孜爬起来以后，马上向对方展开了进攻。突然间，阿不力孜抓住了张魁元的腰带，他一用力就把体重有九十公斤的张魁元给举了起来，随后就把张魁元摔倒在地上。这时坐在北海体育场四周看台上的数千观众立刻热烈地鼓起掌来。由于时间已到，这场比赛以1∶1宣告结束。
