    Welcoming Guests from Singapore and Malaya
    I am a returned overseas Chinese youth from Malaya who came back from Singapore in the spring of 1952. Since returning to the country, I have been looking forward day and night to friends from Singapore and Malaya visiting New China, just as I yearned for relatives from the motherland to visit when I was abroad. Today, the gentlemen of the two investigation groups from Singapore and Malaya have arrived, and my wish has come true. I warmly welcome your arrival. When I was in Malaya, I was a salesperson in a private department store. The circumstances at that time made me not dare to imagine that there would be schools to let people like us study. But after returning to the country, the motherland allowed me to enter school, study for two and a half years, and now I have been working in a medical position for more than a year. In New China, this work is very important and is loved and respected by the people because it is work that serves the health of the people.
    When I was in Malaya, I didn't expect that New China's industry would progress so quickly in just a few years after liberation. Today, you have come to China in person and can tour and inspect it. Friends from Singapore and Malaya may not fully understand the growth of New China's industry. I hope that after your visit, you will introduce the facts to the vast number of friends in Singapore and Malaya.
    Gentlemen of the investigation group, since its establishment, New China has always adhered to a foreign policy of peace and welcomes the establishment of friendly relations with any country on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. Your arrival signifies a new development in the friendly relations between China and the people of Singapore and Malaya. I wish you success in your investigation work.
                                   Gansu, Yang Zixin

    欢迎从新加坡和马来亚来的客人
    我是1952年春由新加坡返国的马来亚华侨青年。返国以后，我日夜盼望着新加坡、马来亚的朋友们能来新中国访问，这种心情正如我在国外时盼望祖国亲人去访问一样。今天，新加坡和马来亚两个考察团的先生们来了，我的愿望实现了，我以热烈的心情欢迎你们的到来。在马来亚时，我是一家私营百货公司的售货员，当时的处境使我不敢设想还有学校让我们这样的人进去学习。但返国以后，祖国却让我进学校，读了两年半的书，现在我已站在医务工作岗位上工作一年多了。在新中国，这门工作任务很重大，也很受人民热爱和尊敬，因为它是为人民的健康服务的工作。
    在马来亚的时候，我没有想到新中国只解放几年，它的工业就进步得这样快。今天，你们亲自来到中国，可以游览视察。新加坡、马来亚的朋友对新中国工业的成长也许不十分了解，希望你们这次访问回去后，把事实介绍给广大的新加坡、马来亚朋友们。
    考察团的先生们，新中国成立以来，一向坚持和平外交政策，并欢迎同任何国家在平等互利基础上建立友好关系，你们的到来，正意味着中国与新加坡、马来亚人民友好关系的新发展。祝你们的考察工作顺利。
