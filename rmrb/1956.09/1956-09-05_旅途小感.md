	Short Trip Impressions
	Ye Zhiqiu

	Recently, while traveling in the Northeast, I noticed that every city, regardless of the theater troupe, was performing "Fifteen Strings of Cash"; the streets of Harbin were plastered with posters of "Fifteen Strings of Cash." In Shenyang, six theater troupes were simultaneously performing "Fifteen Strings of Cash," and the newspaper's opera advertisement section was filled with various fonts all advertising "Fifteen Strings of Cash." This has evolved from "the whole city talking about Fifteen Strings of Cash" to "the whole country competing to perform Fifteen Strings of Cash." Compared to the cold reception "Fifteen Strings of Cash" received a few months ago, the difference is like heaven and earth.

	Many advertisements and posters have a line that reads: "Recommended repertoire by the Ministry of Culture." There is no doubt that such an excellent play should be recommended, and it is not a bad thing for more troupes across the country to perform it.

	However, I think the positive effect of "Fifteen Strings of Cash" should be more than just adding some brilliance to the performance repertoire, giving each opera genre one more excellent play. More importantly, it provides an excellent example, enabling each genre to create and adapt with originality based on their own traditions and unique strengths, truly achieving a blossoming of a hundred flowers in the garden of opera. This is better than every opera genre and every troupe performing "Fifteen Strings of Cash" uniformly. In a certain city, the leading actor of a troupe was a martial arts performer, and they also staged "Fifteen Strings of Cash," so that this martial arts "况锺" had no "skill" to display on stage, which is really too bad.

	In some people's minds, there often exists an unwritten rule: as long as the Ministry of Culture recommends it, no matter the conditions, they will stage it as is. There is nothing wrong with staging it, but wouldn't it be better to actively accept the experience, promote the traditions of one's own opera genre, and carry out original creation? To develop, one must create. Otherwise, the policy of a hundred flowers blooming in the field of opera art will lose its positive effect.

    旅途小感
    叶知秋
    最近在东北旅行，每到一个城市，不论什么剧团，都在演“十五贯”；哈尔滨街头满墙海报贴的是“十五贯”。沈阳市六个剧团同时演出“十五贯”，报纸的戏曲广告栏内用各种铅字排出的戏也都是“十五贯”。这已经从“满城争说十五贯”发展到“举国竞演十五贯”了。和几个月前“十五贯”所受到的冷淡相比，真有天渊之感。
    在许多广告和海报上都写着一行字：“中央文化部推荐剧目”。毫无疑问，这样一出优秀的剧目是应该推荐的，在全国范围内有更多的剧团上演，也不是坏现象。
    但是我想“十五贯”的积极作用，应该是不止于在演出剧目上增添一些光彩，使每个剧种多了一个优秀的剧目，而更重要的是它提供了一个出色的范例，使每个剧种能够根据各自的传统，发挥独自的特长，进行具有独创性的创造和改编，在戏曲的花园中真正做到百花盛开。这样总比每个剧种，每个剧团一律演出“十五贯”好些。某城市有一个剧团的台柱是武生，也排演了“十五贯”，以致这位武“况锺”在舞台上无“技”可施，那就实在太不妙了。
    在有些人的头脑里，常常存在着一种不成文的规章，只要是中央文化部一推荐，不管条件如何，照样搬演。搬演固无不可，但要是从积极方面来接受经验，发扬自己剧种的传统，进行独创性的创造，不是更好吗？要发展就必须创造。否则在戏曲艺术领域中的百花齐放的方针，就会失掉积极作用了。
