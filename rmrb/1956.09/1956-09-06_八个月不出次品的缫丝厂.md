Xinhua News Agency, [no location given,] — The Wuxi Municipal Local State-Operated Silk Reeling Factory No. 3 has not produced a single piece of flawed silk from January to August this year; all products are of standard quality.

According to Xu Ruliang, a technician from the Jiangsu Provincial Silk Industry Bureau who has been engaged in the silk reeling industry for more than 20 years, it is something he has never seen or heard of before, that a factory has not produced any flawed silk for eight consecutive months.

Flawed silk includes raw silk with uneven color mixing, cut-offs, and fibers that are too coarse or too fine, not meeting export specifications. The factory's employees have established a mass quality mutual inspection system in each process, ensuring that no one allows flawed silk to pass through. The administrative and technical leadership departments have also established management systems in the silk reeling workshops to prevent flawed silk, including unified soup temperature, soup color, and cleaning work. At the same time, semi-finished product quality standards and operating methods have also been stipulated for the seven types of work in the post-reeling departments.

    八个月不出次品的缫丝厂
    据新华社讯　无锡市地方国营缫丝第三厂在今年1月份到8月份，从没有生产过一点疵点丝，全部产品都是正品。
    据从事缫丝事业二十多年的江苏省丝绸工业局技术人员许汝良说，连续八个月不出疵点丝，这是从来没见过、也没听说过的事。
    疵点丝包括夹花色不匀、切断和纤维偏粗偏细等不合出口规格的生丝。这个厂的职工在各工序上都建立了群众性的质量互相检查制度，人人不让疵点丝过关。行政技术领导部门也在缫丝车间中建立了防止疵点丝的统一汤温、汤色、清洁工作等项管理制度，同时在后缫部门的七个工种中，也规定了半成品质量标准和操作方法。
