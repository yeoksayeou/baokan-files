    Short-Lived Climbing Boots
    Our Yibin Team of the Hydrogeology and Engineering Geology Bureau of the Ministry of Geology received a batch of leather climbing boots. This batch of shoes was custom-made at the Wuhan Department Store Leather Shoe Factory. According to higher-level regulations, each person only receives one pair of shoes per year, but for the batch of shoes we received, after only thirty-eight days of wear, eighteen pairs in the team had the soles and uppers separate. Some comrades had five toes exposed, and had no choice but to carry the shoes on their backs and return barefoot. Our female comrades were not accustomed to going barefoot in the first place, but helpless, they also carried their shoes on their backs and walked back barefoot, their feet bruised and bleeding.
    The Wuhan Department Store Leather Shoe Factory should seriously conduct an inspection of this processing task, and should no longer produce such low-quality products. Xiao Long

    短命的登山鞋
    我们地质部水文地质工程地质局宜宾队领了一批牛皮登山鞋。这批鞋是在武汉市百货公司皮鞋加工厂定制的。按上级规定，每人每年只发一双鞋，可是我们领的这批鞋，只穿了三十八天，全队就有十八双底、帮分了家，有的同志五个趾头露在外面，只好把鞋背在背上，光着脚回来。我们的女同志本来不习惯光脚，无可奈何，也背着鞋子光脚走回来，脚都碰破出血了。
    武汉市百货公司皮鞋加工厂应该认真对这批加工任务进行一次检查，不要再生产这种质量低劣的产品了。　小龙
