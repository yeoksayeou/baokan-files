Xinhua News Agency, September 25th—The Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China continued this afternoon.

	Chen Yi (Vice Premier of the State Council) first spoke on the current international situation and China's foreign policy.

	Chen Yi pointed out that the characteristics of the current international situation are: the forces in the world striving for and maintaining peace are constantly developing and growing, and the international reactionary forces pursuing policies of aggression and war are in an increasingly weakened and isolated position. This change in the balance of power is definitely leading the international situation towards detente.

	Chen Yi then explained in detail China's future tasks in international affairs.

	When Chen Yi talked about the Chinese people's task of liberating Taiwan, he said that Taiwan is an inseparable part of Chinese territory, and the possibility of peaceful liberation of Taiwan is greatly increasing. However, no matter what method is adopted to liberate Taiwan, Taiwan will inevitably return to the embrace of the motherland.

	Li Weihan (Head of the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee) spoke today on the Party's united front work.

	He first explained the relationship with the bourgeoisie, pointing out that this has always been an important issue in the Party's general line. Under the leadership of the Party Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, the Party has successfully won over and has basically transformed the national bourgeoisie by adhering to the policy of actively striving for unity and struggling against it, and seeking unity through struggle. Li Weihan explained the main experiences in implementing this policy, and described the united front work regarding upper-level figures of ethnic minorities, patriotic figures in religious circles, and overseas Chinese.

	Zhou Yang (Deputy Head of the Propaganda Department of the CPC Central Committee) said in his speech that the socialist revolution has opened the way for all creative labor. However, dogmatism and sectarianism in literature and art that frequently occur among us, as well as simplistic and crude attitudes towards literary and artistic work, have seriously restricted the creative freedom of writers and artists and become the main obstacles to realizing the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend."

	Zhou Yang said that the Party's literary and art workers should learn modestly from writers and artists outside the Party. Questions of artistic nature should mainly rely on the creative practice and mutual discussion of literary and art workers themselves to solve.

	Saifuddin (Secretary of the CPC Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Committee) said in his speech that he explained the various achievements and future basic tasks of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.

	Wang Shoudao (Director of the Sixth Office of the State Council) spoke on transportation and postal and telecommunications work, saying: At present, there is a contradiction between transportation capacity and freight volume. In order to solve this contradiction, it is necessary to actively expand the transportation network; strengthen the technical transformation of existing transportation lines and equipment; rationally utilize various transportation tools, and promote rational transportation; and it is necessary to always maintain a certain transportation reserve force.

	Huang Jing (Director of the State Technology Commission and Minister of the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry) expressed his views on two important issues in the development of China's machinery industry, namely, transforming the repair-based industry into a manufacturing industry and developing from imitation to independent design.

	Tang Dihua (Director of the Design Department of the Ministry of Chemical Industry), Zhao Shuli (writer), Xu Liqun (Director of the Theoretical Propaganda Department of the CPC Central Committee Propaganda Department), Rao Bin (Director of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant), and Liu Shunyuan (Secretary of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the CPC) also spoke today.

	In his speech, Tang Dihua pointed out the insufficient caution of relevant departments in the formulation and modification of the national basic construction plan, and hoped to earnestly improve the planning work and cooperative relations of basic construction. Zhao Shuli talked about the need to create more literary and artistic works needed by the masses and enrich the cultural and recreational life of the masses. Xu Liqun expressed his views on improving the current theoretical education work of cadres. Rao Bin introduced some effective measures taken by the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant in organizing employees to learn new technologies in his speech. Liu Shunyuan requested relevant departments of the Central Government to actively explore the industrial potential of Jiangsu Province in his speech.

	In their speeches today, all eleven representatives unanimously agreed with the three reports made by the Party Central Committee to the Congress.

	Today's meeting ended at 6:55 pm. The executive chairmen of the Congress were: Bo Yibo, Lin Tie, Jia Tuofu, Luo Ruiqing, Shuai Mengqi, Lin Feng, Wang Jiaxiang, Song Renqiong, Yang Xiufeng.

	The Congress will continue tomorrow.

    中共第八次全国代表大会继续开会
    据新华社25日讯　中国共产党第八次全国代表大会，25日下午继续举行。
    陈毅（国务院副总理）首先就目前国际形势和我国的外交政策发言。
    陈毅指出，目前国际形势的特点是：世界上争取和维护和平的力量不断地发展壮大，执行侵略和战争政策的国际反动势力处于日益削弱和孤立的地位。这种力量对比的变化，使国际局势肯定地趋向和缓。
    陈毅接着详细地说明了我国在国际事务方面今后的任务。
    陈毅谈到中国人民解放台湾的任务时说，台湾是中国领土不可分割的一部分，和平解放台湾的可能性正在大大地增长。但是不论台湾的解放将会采取怎样的方式，台湾必然要回到祖国的怀抱。
    李维汉（中共中央统一战线工作部部长）今天就党的统一战线工作发言。
    他首先说明同资产阶级的关系，指出这从来就是党的总路线中的一个重要问题。党在以毛泽东同志为首的党中央的领导下，由于坚持执行了积极争取和又团结又斗争、以斗争求团结的政策，从而成功地争取了并且已经在基本上改造了民族资产阶级。李维汉说明了执行这个政策的主要经验，并叙述了关于少数民族上层分子、宗教界爱国人士和国外华侨方面的统一战线工作。
    周扬（中共中央宣传部副部长）在发言中说，社会主义革命已经为一切创造性的劳动开辟了道路。但是，在我们中间，经常发生的文艺上的教条主义、宗派主义，以及对待文艺工作的简单化的、粗暴的态度，却严重地束缚了作家、艺术家的创作自由，成为实现“百家争鸣，百花齐放”方针的主要障碍。
    周扬说，党的文艺工作者应当虚心地向党外作家、艺术家学习。艺术性质的问题应当主要依靠文艺工作者自己的创作实践和互相讨论来解决。
    赛福鼎（中共新疆维吾尔自治区委员会书记）在发言中说，就新疆维吾尔自治区的各项成就和今后的基本任务作了说明。
    王首道（国务院第六办公室主任）就运输和邮电工作问题发言说：目前已经出现了运输能力与运量之间不相适应的矛盾。为了解决这个矛盾，必须积极地扩大运输网；加强对现有运输线路和设备的技术改造；合理地利用各种运输工具，推行合理运输；并且要经常保持一定的运输后备力量。
    黄敬（国家技术委员会主任兼第一机械工业部部长）就我国机械工业发展中的两个重要问题，即将修配性的工业改造为制造的工业和从仿造向自行设计的方向发展的问题，发表了意见。
    今天发言的还有唐棣华（化学工业部设计司司长）、赵树理（作家）、许立群（中共中央宣传部理论宣传处处长）、饶斌（第一汽车制造厂厂长）和刘顺元（中共江苏省委书记）。
    唐棣华在发言中指出了有关部门对国家基本建设计划的编制和修改不够慎重的情况，希望切实改进基本建设的计划工作和协作配合关系。赵树理谈了要更多地创造群众需要的文艺作品，丰富群众文娱生活的问题。许立群就改进目前干部理论教育工作发表了意见。饶斌在发言中介绍了第一汽车制造厂在组织职工群众学习新技术所采取的一些有效措施。刘顺元在发言中要求中央有关部门积极地发掘江苏省工业的潜力。
    今天十一位代表在发言中都一致同意党中央委员会向大会所作的三个报告。
