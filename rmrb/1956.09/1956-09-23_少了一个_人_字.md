    A Missing "Person" Character
    The title of a news item on the front page of the People's Daily on September 10th was: "Enabling the Baoji-Fengzhou Railway to be Electrified, Our Technicians Complete Partial Technical Design." Upon closer inspection of the news dispatch, this wasn't quite the case; it was actually: "Designed by our own technical personnel." Omitting one character makes a big difference in meaning. As everyone knows, "technical personnel" includes engineers, technicians, and so on. Writing only "technicians" easily leads people to misunderstand that it doesn't include engineers.　Song Zhou, Wen Chi

    少了一个“人”字
    9月10日人民日报第一版一条新闻的标题是：“使宝凤段铁路电气化，我国技术员完成部分技术设计”。细看电讯，并非如此，原来是：“由我国技术人员自己设计的”。省略一字，意义便差了很远。大家知道，技术人员包括工程师、技术员等。只写技术员，便很容易使人误解为不包括工程师在内。　宋周、文迟
