The Beijing Library started international book exchange work soon after the founding of New China and has now established contacts with 563 institutions in 64 countries across Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia, North and South America. The Beijing Library regularly receives books from Moscow, Berlin, Warsaw, Prague, London, Paris, New York, Calcutta, Tokyo, and other cities. The Beijing Library also regularly sends newly published domestic books and periodicals to libraries and scientific research institutions around the world. In the past six years, a total of 301,615 volumes of books and periodicals have been sent out, and 182,162 volumes of books and periodicals have been received.

The books exchanged by the Beijing Library are very broad in content, including Chinese translations of Marxist-Leninist works, works by Chinese revolutionary leaders, government decrees and documents, reports on the economic and cultural construction of the Chinese people, science and technology books, famous Chinese classical literature and works by modern writers, and various journals and newspapers. The books sent by foreign libraries include translations of Marxist-Leninist works in various languages, science and technology books, literary and artistic works, etc. It is particularly worth mentioning that the Lenin State Library of the Soviet Union and the Library of the Soviet Academy of Sciences often send the latest Soviet scientific achievements to the Beijing Library as soon as they are published. Recently, they sent books on "atomic energy," "electronic computers," and "semiconductors." These books have played a significant role in China's scientific research work.

The books exchanged by the Beijing Library with foreign countries, in addition to keeping three copies of each for readers to read, the remaining copies are distributed to 312 units including municipal-level public libraries, universities, factories, mines, and government agencies, according to their nature. In the first half of 1956, a total of 22,031 volumes of books and periodicals were distributed. To provide access for a wide range of readers, the Beijing Library compiles and prints the "Catalog of Newly Arrived International Exchange Books and Periodicals" (monthly) to introduce new books to readers in a timely manner. Readers in other locations can borrow books listed in the catalog through the "interlibrary loan" procedure. At the same time, since June of this year, the Beijing Library and the Lenin State Library of the Soviet Union have established interlibrary loan relations, and can borrow books from the Lenin Library on behalf of domestic academic research institutions. In the first month, the library received applications from 51 units. In addition, the Beijing Library also conducts the work of soliciting books and periodicals from abroad on behalf of domestic units. In the first half of 1956, 311 kinds of books and periodicals were solicited for 78 units.

In order to cooperate with China's scientific research work, the Beijing Library plans to establish contacts with scientific research institutions in various countries in the next two years, expand sources of information, and make up for the current shortage of research materials.

With the increase of China's international status, people in the Soviet Union, people's democratic countries, colonial countries, and capitalist countries all hope to see Chinese books and periodicals to understand the life and construction achievements of the Chinese people. The Beijing Library regularly receives letters from foreign libraries requesting Chinese books and periodicals. The Beijing Library has met their requests.

In recent years, the international book exchange work of the Beijing Library has not only strengthened the mutual understanding between the Chinese and people of all countries, but also enriched the cultural life of each other. With the increase of friendship between the Chinese people and the people of all countries, international book exchange work will be further developed.

    北京图书馆的国际书刊交换工作
    李哲民
    北京图书馆在新中国建国后不久，即开展了国际书刊的交换工作，现在已经同欧、亚、非、澳、南北美各洲六十四个国家五百六十三个单位建立了联系。北京图书馆经常收到莫斯科、柏林、华沙、布拉格、伦敦、巴黎、纽约、加尔各答、东京以及其它城市寄来的书籍。北京图书馆也经常把国内新出版的书刊寄给世界各国的图书馆和科学研究机构。六年来共寄出了书刊三十万零一千六百十五册，收到了书刊十八万二千一百六十二册。
    北京图书馆向外交换的书籍内容非常广泛，包括马克思列宁主义著作的中译本，中国革命领袖们的著作，政府的法令、文件，有关中国人民在经济和文化建设方面的报告，科学技术书籍，中国古典文学名著和近代作家的作品，各种期刊报纸等。国外图书馆寄来的书籍有马克思列宁主义著作的各国文字的译本，科学技术书籍，文学艺术作品等等。特别值得提出的是苏联国立列宁图书馆、苏联科学院图书馆，经常把反映苏联最新科学成就的书籍，刚一出版就立刻寄给北京图书馆，最近寄来的有关于“原子能”、“电子计算机”、“半导体”等方面的书籍。这些书籍对我国的科学研究工作起了很大的作用。
    北京图书馆同国外交换来的书籍，除每种留三册供读者阅览外，其余的复本根据性质分配给市级以上的公共图书馆、高等学校、厂矿、机关等共三百十二个单位。1956年上半年，共分配出书刊二万二千零三十一册。为了供给广大读者的利用，北京图书馆编印了“国际交换新到书刊目录”（月刊），及时地向读者介绍新到的书籍，在外地的读者可通过“馆际互借”手续借到目录上所列的书籍。同时，从本年6月起，北京图书馆和苏联国立列宁图书馆建立了馆际互借关系，可代国内学术研究机构向列宁图书馆借书，在第一个月中该馆就接受了五十一个单位的申请书。此外，北京图书馆还代替国内各单位进行向国外征求书刊的工作。1956年上半年，代七十八个单位征到了书刊三百十一种。
    为了配合我国的科学研究工作，北京图书馆准备在今明两年内同世界各国的科学研究机构建立联系，扩大资料来源，弥补目前研究资料的不足。
    随着我国国际地位的提高，不论在苏联、人民民主国家或殖民地国家、资本主义国家的人民，都希望看到中国的书刊，借以了解中国人民的生活和建设的成就。北京图书馆经常收到国外图书馆的来信征求我国的书刊。北京图书馆都满足了他们的要求。
    几年来，北京图书馆的国际书刊交换工作，不但加强了中国和各国人民之间的相互了解，同时，也丰富了相互间的文化生活。随着我国人民和各国人民之间友谊的增进，国际书刊的交换工作将更进一步开展起来。
