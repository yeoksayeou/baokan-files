Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, September 24th: Indian Prime Minister Nehru flew from Delhi to Saudi Arabia this morning. He is visiting for three days at the invitation of the King of Saudi Arabia, who visited India last winter.

Nehru told reporters at the airport that the decision by Britain and France to submit the Suez issue to the United Nations Security Council was "a good turn" and, in a sense, "a shift away from war, which is certainly a good thing." He said, "We cannot wage war on the one hand and hold discussions in the United Nations on the other."

A reporter asked whether the Security Council, where India is not represented and China is represented by the Taiwan Kuomintang, is a "good and realistic forum" for discussing issues such as the Suez dispute. Nehru said: "Any forum that achieves results is realistic and good. If it doesn't, then it isn't."

Nehru also said that he had long looked forward to this visit to Saudi Arabia. He believes that, at present, a close understanding of the widespread demands in the Arab world is even more important than before.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, September 24th: According to the Press Trust of India, Prime Minister Nehru reiterated on September 23rd that the Suez issue can only be resolved in a conference with Egypt's participation.

On the eve of his departure for Saudi Arabia, Nehru said at a public gathering in New Delhi that the danger of war breaking out over the Suez issue had been greatly reduced, but the problem had not been resolved.

He said that India firmly believes that the Suez Canal is part of Egypt, and Egypt's sovereignty over the canal should not be diminished in the slightest. He added that there is another aspect to the issue: that many countries use the Suez Canal, and it is an important link in world commerce and trade. It must continue to be open to the ships of all countries without obstruction.

Nehru said that certain factors have complicated the Suez issue. Oil is one factor, and behind it is the awakening power of the Asian and African countries that are safeguarding their independence. The entire old relationship between Europe and these countries is changing and must change. This is an unavoidable process. However, the question is whether this process, which has impacted Europe's vested interests, will be achieved through bloodshed and war or through peaceful means.

He commented on India's method of gaining freedom. He said: Egypt has said many appropriate and reasonable things on the Suez Canal issue. India has close and friendly relations with Egypt. "However, I must say that Egypt's method of taking the canal is not our method. We adopted a different method. But how can I criticize others? If they (the Egyptians) had adopted a different method, so many difficulties would not have arisen. But they have the right to adopt their own method."

He said that the Suez issue should not be resolved like "wrestling" between countries trying to defeat each other. He also urged countries to use restrained language on this issue, avoiding words that might hurt or insult others and undermine the entire atmosphere.

Referring to the anxiety of some European countries about their oil supplies, Nehru said that they believe that Egypt's move would strangle them, and they cannot survive without oil from West Asia. "But they do not believe that the oil they are entitled to receive can only be obtained after a peaceful solution is achieved. If war breaks out, or if the issue is to be resolved by war, then it should be remembered that it is these oil wells that will be destroyed."

Nehru said that his visit to Saudi Arabia has nothing to do with the Suez crisis, and it was arranged several months ago.

### 尼赫鲁强调和平解决运河问题  赞同把问题提交安全理事会讨论

    尼赫鲁强调和平解决运河问题
    赞同把问题提交安全理事会讨论
    新华社新德里24日电　印度总理尼赫鲁今天早上乘飞机从德里动身去沙特阿拉伯。他是应去年冬天到印度访问的沙特阿拉伯国王的邀请前往作三天访问的。
    尼赫鲁在机场对报界发表谈话说，英法决定把苏伊士问题提交联合国安全理事会是“一个好转”，在某种意义上说，它是“一个远离战争的转变，这当然是很好的事”。他说，“我们不可能一方面进行战争，另一方面又在联合国中进行讨论”。
    有记者问，在安全理事会上，印度没有代表，而中国却由台湾国民党来代表，它是不是一个讨论像苏伊士争端这种问题的“良好和现实的讲坛”。尼赫鲁说：“凡是取得结果的讲坛都是现实的和良好的。如果它做不到这一点，那就不是。”
    尼赫鲁还说，他对这次到沙特阿拉伯去访问盼望已久。他认为，在目前，密切了解阿拉伯世界普遍存在的要求甚至比以前更重要了。
    新华社新德里24日电　据印度报业托辣斯报道，印度总理尼赫鲁9月23日重申，苏伊士问题只有在有埃及参加的会议上才能解决。
    尼赫鲁在启程前往沙特阿拉伯访问前夕，在新德里一次公众集会上说，在苏伊士问题上燃起战火的危险已经大大减轻了，但是问题没有解决。
    他说，印度坚决认为，苏伊士运河是埃及的一部分，埃及对运河的主权不应当有丝毫的缩小。他又说，这个问题有另外一面，这就是有很多国家使用苏伊士运河，它在世界商业和贸易中是一个重要的环节。它必须继续不受妨碍地向所有国家的船只开放。
    尼赫鲁说，某些因素使苏伊士问题复杂化了。石油就是一个因素，而在这背后还有维护独立性的亚非国家的觉醒的力量。欧洲和这些国家之间的整个旧关系正在改变而且必须改变。这是一个无法避免的过程。但是，问题在于，这种打击了欧洲的既得的利益的过程是通过流血和战争还是通过和平方法来实现。
    他评论了印度获得自由的方法。他说：埃及就苏伊士运河问题说过许多恰当和通情达理的话。印度同埃及有密切和友好的关系。“然而我要说，埃及取得运河的方法不是我们的方法。我们采用不同的方法。但是我怎么能批评别人呢？如果他们（埃及人）采用一种不同的方法，这么多的困难就不会产生了。但是，他们有权利采用他们自己的方法。”
    他说，苏伊士问题不应当像互相企图打倒对方的国家之间“摔跤”那样来解决。他还要求各国在这个问题上使用字眼要有节制，避免说出可能损伤别人或侮辱别人而破坏整个气氛的话。
    在谈到某些欧洲国家对于它们的石油供应的焦急心情的时候，尼赫鲁说，它们认为，埃及的这个步骤会勒死它们，而没有西亚的石油他们是活不成的。“但是它们却不认为那些它们有权得到的石油只有在和平解决实现以后，它们才能得到。如果发生了战争，或者这个问题要用战争来解决，那末应当记住，正是这些油井都将被破坏。”
    尼赫鲁说，他去沙特阿拉伯访问同苏伊士危机没有关系，那是在几个月以前安排的。
