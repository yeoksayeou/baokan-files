    From Our Readers
    Pay Attention to Cultural Materials
    In order to preserve the art of famous folk artists, we visited Mr. Wang Jiekui, an old artist who tells the "Bao Gong Cases" story, on August 21st. Mr. Wang is eighty-three years old this year. Although he can still tell stories, he cannot perform a whole book due to poor memory. It is said that the Central People's Broadcasting Station still has his recordings. Therefore, on August 24th, we contacted the Central People's Broadcasting Station and learned that this recording, along with more than 1,000 other recordings, had been handed over to the Qifeng Iron Factory on the 23rd to be destroyed. When we arrived at the Qifeng Iron Factory, the factory was using a large pot to boil off the wax surface of the recordings to remove the lead disc blanks for remaking recording tape backing. We immediately requested the factory to suspend the destruction. After we preliminarily inspected a portion of the unboiled recordings, we found recordings of Wang Jiekui's "Three Eating Fish," the late Jingyun Dagu master Bai Yunpeng's "Mulan Joins the Army," the late famous Ping Shu artist Zhao Yingpo's new Ping Shu "Village Feud," as well as Kunqu Opera, local operas, ancient music, folk music, and Buddhist, Taoist, and Islamic music. However, all the disc covers were missing, and only serial numbers remained on the discs. Most of them were unmarked, making it difficult to identify them. Therefore, we contacted the radio station again on the 25th to borrow the catalog for searching. According to the comrades in the radio station's tape room, these recordings were the original tapes, and there used to be copies, but they had already been destroyed. These original tapes were destroyed because they had been stored for too long and were no longer audible. They said that the room had suggested three years ago that the relevant units of the radio station should check and copy them for preservation, but this work had not been done; before this destruction, notices had also been sent to the relevant units. Based on the catalog, we checked again and found that many important recordings were not in the catalog, and those registered in the catalog could not be found because the discs lacked marks. If we were to listen to them one by one, the waste of manpower and material resources would be considerable. Now, except for a portion that we borrowed from the Qifeng Iron Factory with the permission of the Equipment Department of the Central People's Broadcasting Station and the portion that has been destroyed, most of the original recordings are still stored in the Qifeng Iron Factory, awaiting disposal.

    These original recordings are not all inaudible; some original recordings are very clear. Cultural materials not only exist in books, newspapers, magazines, and archives, but also in various cultural relics. We should pay attention to them in all aspects. The Central People's Broadcasting Station should not arbitrarily destroy precious cultural materials. (Feng Buyi)

    重视文化资料
    为了保留著名民间老艺人们的艺术，我们在8月21日访问了说评书“包公案”的老艺人王杰魁先生。王老先生今年八十三岁，虽然还能够讲述，但由于记忆力不好，已经不能整本地表演了。据说中央人民广播电台还保留有他的录音。因此，我们在8月24日打电话同中央人民广播电台联系，才知道这项录音片连同其他录音片共一千多张，已经在23日交给奇峰铁工厂去销毁了。我们赶到奇峰铁工厂的时候，厂方正用大锅煮下录音片上的蜡面，取下铅质盘胎改制录音胶带底托，我们当即要求厂方暂停销毁。经我们把未煮的录音片初步检视了一部分，就发现有王杰魁说的“三吃鱼”，已故京韵大鼓名艺人白云鹏唱的“木兰从军”，已故说聊斋志异的著名评书家赵英颇说的新评书“村仇”，以及昆曲，地方戏，古乐，民间音乐，佛教、道教、伊斯兰教音乐等录音在内。但盘套均无，盘上仅存编号，大部分还没有标志，很难辨认。所以我们在25日再同电台联系，商借目录以便寻检。据电台胶带室的同志说，这批录音片是原片，曾有复制品，但早已销毁了。这批原片是因为存放年久，已不成音，所以销毁。并说该室曾于三年前建议由电台各有关单位加以查核，复制保留，但这项工作一直没有做；在这次销毁前，也向各有关单位发过通知。我们根据目录再去查点，发现其中有许多重要录音是目录中所没有的，而目录中登记着的仍因为片上缺少标志，无法查出，如果一片片去听，人力物力的浪费是相当大的。现在除了经中央人民广播电台器材处允许，由我们向奇峰铁工厂借走的一部分和已销毁的部分外，大部分录音原片，尚在奇峰铁工厂存放，等待处理。
    这批录音原片并不是已不成音，有的原片声音十分清晰。文化资料不仅仅存在于书报杂志和档案中，同时也存在于各种文物中，我们应该从各方面来重视它，中央人民广播电台不应该这样任意销毁珍贵的文化资料。　（冯不异）
