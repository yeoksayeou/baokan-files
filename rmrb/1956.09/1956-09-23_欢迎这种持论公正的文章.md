    Welcome Articles with a Fair Stance
    We, several comrades from the Materials Supply Company of the Luoyang Engineering Bureau under the Ministry of Construction Engineering, felt that the article "Don't Just Criticize, But Also Provide Concrete Help" published on the second page of the People's Daily on August 27th was very good. This article tells us that while leading organs and leading cadres should criticize the shortcomings and mistakes in the work of subordinate factories and enterprises, they should also find ways to help solve the objective difficulties faced by the subordinates, instead of merely blaming them. This article also tells us that when newspapers criticize the work of factories and enterprises, they should be realistic and not exaggerate people's shortcomings, nor should they completely dismiss the objective reasons for the shortcomings. We believe that the issues raised in this article are educational for everyone. We welcome such articles with a fair stance. Wang Liting

    欢迎这种持论公正的文章
    8月27日人民日报第二版发表的“不要只是批评，还要具体帮助”一文，我们建筑工程部洛阳工程局材料供应公司的几个同志看了都觉得很好。这篇文章告诉我们，领导机关和领导干部对下面工厂企业工作中的缺点和错误，固然应当批评，但是下面有客观的困难，也要设法帮助解决，不能一味指责。这篇文章也告诉我们，报纸在批评工厂企业的工作的时候，要实事求是，不要夸大人家的缺点，不要完全抹煞造成缺点的客观原因。我们觉得这篇文章提出的问题对大家都有教育意义。我们欢迎这种持论公正的文章。　王礼亭
