Xinhua News Agency, Prague, September 13th: A joint communiqué issued after talks between the government delegations of the Czechoslovak Republic and the German Democratic Republic in Prague stated that the talks showed that both sides held consistent views on the international situation: the policies of both governments were equally committed to consistently strengthening and safeguarding peace, guaranteeing the independence of all peoples, and further expanding international cooperation based on the principles of peaceful coexistence.

The two governments expressed sympathy to the peoples and governments of Asian and African countries striving to safeguard their national independence. Both sides fully supported the Egyptian government's views on the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company.

The joint statement said that the government delegations of the two countries also discussed the issues of expanding and strengthening the two countries' economic, scientific, and cultural ties. Both countries expressed their hope to further develop the broad and close cooperation and mutual assistance that had been established.

During the negotiations, certain issues related to the conclusion of a long-term trade agreement between Czechoslovakia and the German Democratic Republic for 1957-1960 were also discussed. The draft agreement stipulated that the volume of trade would increase by approximately double that of the first long-term trade agreement for 1952-1955.

The leaders of the two governments signed a protocol on economic cooperation between the two countries.

Economic cooperation between the two countries will include the division of labor between the two countries' industries, for example, the German Democratic Republic will specialize in the production of 3.5-ton trucks, while Czechoslovakia will produce heavy-duty trucks. This division of labor will also apply to the production of agricultural machinery and other production aspects.

The two governments noted with satisfaction the expansion of contacts in culture, science, education, art, and sports between the two countries, and the strengthening of cooperation in other issues.

The two governments agreed that the unity, consolidation, and fraternal cooperation of the socialist camp countries are the international foundation for the independence, prosperity, and freedom of the two countries, and a guarantee of world peace and security. Therefore, the two governments will in the future develop and strengthen relations with the Soviet Union, China, Poland, and other countries in the socialist camp.

    捷德发表会谈联合声明
    两国要发展亲密的合作和互助
    新华社布拉格13日电　捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府代表团和德意志民主共和国政府代表团在布拉格举行会谈后发表联合声明说，会谈表明，双方对国际局势抱着一致的看法：两国政府的政策都同样致力于一贯加强和维护和平、保障各国人民的独立以及以和平共处原则为基础进一步扩大国际合作。
    两国政府向努力保障自己民族独立的亚非各国人民和他们的政府表示同情。双方完全支持埃及政府在苏彝士运河公司国有化问题上的见解。
    联合声明说，两国政府代表团还讨论了扩大和加强两国的经济、科学和文化联系的问题。两国表示希望进一步发展已建立起来的广泛和紧密的合作和互助。
    在谈判当中，还讨论了有关捷克斯洛伐克和民主德国缔结1957年—1960年的长期贸易协定的某些问题，协定草案规定，换货量将比1952年—1955年的第一个长期贸易协定增加约一倍。
    两国政府领导人签订了关于两国经济合作的议定书。
    两国的经济合作将包括两国工业间的劳动分工，例如民主德国将专门生产三点五吨的卡车，而捷克斯洛伐克将生产重型卡车。这种劳动分工还适用于生产农业机器和其他生产方面。
    两国政府满意地指出，两国在文化、科学、教育、艺术和体育方面的接触有了扩大，在其他问题上的合作有了加强。
    两国政府一致认为，社会主义阵营国家的团结、巩固和兄弟般合作是两国的独立、繁荣和自由的国际基础，是世界和平和安全的保证。因此，两国政府今后将发展和加强同苏联、中国、波兰以及社会主义阵营其他国家的关系。
