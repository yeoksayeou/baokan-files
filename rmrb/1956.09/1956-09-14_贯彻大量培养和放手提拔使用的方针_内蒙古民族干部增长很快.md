Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, September 13th: The number of cadres from the Mongolian, Hui, Manchu, Daur, Solon, and Oroqen ethnic groups in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has now reached more than 22,000.

In its work of cultivating ethnic minority cadres over the past few years, the Autonomous Region has resolutely implemented the policy of universal mass training and bold promotion, thus resulting in the rapid growth of ethnic minority cadres. The number of cadres from the Mongolian, Hui, Manchu, Oroqen, and Korean ethnic groups has increased three to four times compared to 1949. The number of cadres from the Daur and Oroqen ethnic groups has increased fourteen to fifteen and a half times compared to 1949. These cadres are mainly young intellectuals, workers, farmers, and herdsmen. Excellent individuals among them have already joined the Chinese Communist Party. Currently, over 37% of all ethnic minority cadres in Inner Mongolia are Communist Party members.

These cadres are distributed throughout pastoral areas, rural areas, and cities in Inner Mongolia. Many have been promoted to leadership positions at all levels of the Party and government, holding important posts. According to statistics from the end of 1955, among the leading cadres at the autonomous region level, league (prefecture) level, and banner (county) level, there were 1,168 cadres of Mongolian and other ethnic minorities, accounting for over 30% of the total. Currently, many of the main leaders of the Party and government from the autonomous region down to the league, banner, and county levels are cadres of Mongolian and other ethnic minorities. For example, in the newly elected Inner Mongolia People's Committee, ethnic minority members account for 51% of the 49 members. In leagues, banners, and counties with concentrated ethnic populations, the Party and government leadership organizations are basically composed of ethnic minority cadres. A considerable number of ethnic minority cadres have also been assigned to other work departments and enterprise units, basically realizing the nationalization of autonomous organs.

In order to continuously improve the political theory, cultural level, and professional knowledge of ethnic minority cadres, and to further cultivate ethnic minority cadres in science and technology to ensure the economic and cultural construction of the autonomous region, Party committees at all levels in Inner Mongolia have established and run many specialized schools, such as agriculture, animal husbandry, forestry, cooperation, and finance and economics, as well as Party schools and cadre schools to train large numbers of cadres. More than 1,000 cadres of various ethnic groups have also been selected to study in various universities and colleges in the country. Now, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has cultivated a group of senior ethnic minority intellectuals with specialized knowledge in linguistics, medicine, history, literature, and art.

    贯彻大量培养和放手提拔使用的方针
    内蒙古民族干部增长很快
    新华社呼和浩特13日讯　内蒙古自治区的蒙古、回、满、达呼尔、索伦和鄂伦春等民族干部，现在已达两万两千多名。
    自治区几年来在培养民族干部工作中，坚决贯彻执行了普遍大量培养和放手提拔使用的方针，因此民族干部增长很快。蒙古、回、满、鄂伦春和朝鲜等五个民族的干部，都比1949年增加了三倍到四倍多。达呼尔、鄂伦春两个民族的干部比1949年增加了十四到十五倍半。这些干部主要是青年知识分子和工人、农民和牧民。他们中的优秀人物已经加入了中国共产党。现在内蒙古所有少数民族干部中37％以上是共产党员。
    这些干部分布在内蒙古牧区、农村和城市等地。有很多人已被提拔到党和政府的各级领导岗位上担任着重要的职务。据1955年底统计，自治区一级和盟（地）、旗（县）级领导干部中，蒙古族及其他少数民族的干部就有一千一百六十八名，占总数30％以上。现在从自治区到盟、旗、县的党和政府的主要领导人，很多是由蒙古族和其他少数民族的干部来担任。如今年新选的内蒙古人民委员会四十九名委员中，少数民族委员就占51％。在民族聚居区的盟、旗、县，党政领导机构基本上由少数民族干部所组成。在其他工作部门及事业企业单位，也都配备有相当数量的民族干部，基本上实现了自治机关的民族化。
    内蒙古各级党委为了不断提高民族干部的政治理论、文化程度和业务知识水平，以及进一步在科学技术方面培养民族干部，以保证自治区的经济和文化建设，已设立和举办了许多农、牧、林业，合作、财经等专业学校和党校、干部学校来培养训练着大批干部。并且还抽出一千多名各民族干部到国内各种高等学校学习。现在内蒙古自治区已经成长了一批在语言学、医学、历史学以及文学艺术等方面具有专门知识的少数民族高级知识分子。
