　　In the evening, Wu Chunsi, the director of the Xinghuo Agricultural Production Cooperative, convened a management committee meeting to discuss the issue of operating sideline production. More than a dozen management committee members arrived one after another, and it was almost ten o'clock. Some people kept smoking cigarettes, and thick smoke rose from the edge of the table, swirling around and causing people to cough. The speeches of others were a bit difficult to hear, but with a little attention, it could be heard that everyone agreed with Wu Chunsi's opinion on operating sideline production: in order to enable the members to concentrate their efforts on doing a good job in agricultural production, all sideline occupations should be operated by the cooperative, and members should not be allowed to engage in household sideline occupations.

　　However, a few committee members raised different opinions:

　　"If all sideline occupations are contracted by the cooperative and members are not allowed to engage in any household sideline occupations, then the restrictions are too rigid."

　　"No! It's better to have stricter restrictions," said Lao Wu, a management committee member and production team leader, resolutely. "If members are allowed to engage in household sideline occupations, it will be troublesome. For example, if individuals grow melons and vegetables, it will inevitably affect their work in the team, and the accumulated fertilizer will first be applied to their own melon and vegetable plots, and the team's crops will lack fertilizer and will not grow well. Furthermore, pigs, chickens, ducks, etc., raised by individuals are not well cared for and can easily spoil the team's crops. Now, all teams are implementing contract labor and output, and if members are allowed to engage in household sideline occupations like this, there will be compensation for production shortfalls. As a team leader, I cannot bear this responsibility!"

　　Most of the management committee members present were also production team leaders, and they all agreed with Lao Wu's opinion, saying, "Yes! Household sideline occupations are not allowed - if they are engaged in, only the individuals benefit, and the collective suffers."

　　Wu Chunsi felt that everyone's opinions made sense, but the problem had not been thoroughly explained. He said slowly:

　　"Now that we have advanced to a higher-level cooperative, everyone must take individual affairs less seriously and collective affairs more seriously. Think about it, without the cooperative's agricultural production and sideline production, how much can household sideline occupations solve, no matter how well they are done! Moreover, allowing members to engage in household sideline occupations is tantamount to condoning them to develop capitalism. This is a principled error!"

　　Everyone listened attentively, nodding.

　　A few days later, Wu Chunsi heard the report of the production team leaders on the implementation of the management committee's resolution. He listened with relish, his face full of smiles, and he kept shouting in his heart "Well done."

　　The production team leaders' reports were as follows: They were actively trying to prevent members from engaging in household sideline occupations. They criticized those who demanded to engage in household sideline occupations as having "capitalist ideas." They mobilized pig farmers to quickly sell their pigs and invest the money in the cooperative. In the Fifth Production Team, the captain saw a member's pig spoiling crops and beat it so that it did not eat for four days. In the Second Production Team, two ducks raised by a member ate some of the seedlings in a member's responsibility field, and they were immediately beaten to death. These two facts more forcefully "educated" the members to give up engaging in household sideline occupations. The production team leader also told the cooperative director that because the members were prevented from engaging in household sideline occupations, the members concentrated their efforts on agricultural production in order to earn work points, and the attendance rate reached over 95%. Wu Chunsi recorded these facts one by one, preparing to use them as summary materials in the future.

　　The household sideline occupations of the members had been suspended for several months. People could not get any cash income, and not only those with empty savings felt financial difficulties, but even those with some savings gradually spent all their money. More and more people borrowed money from the cooperative for oil, salt, and pocket money.

　　At first, Wu Chunsi did not take this matter to heart. He thought: Borrow if you borrow, with the income from collective sideline occupations, there is no need to worry about not being able to cope. However, when he found out the income situation of collective sideline occupations, he became anxious. Although the cooperative operated many sideline occupations, not many could generate income at the moment. For example, larger sideline occupations such as pig farming and fish farming would not yield income until after the autumn harvest. As for processing wine and grinding flour for the grain department, in addition to earning fertilizer, the processing fee earned was just enough to buy firewood. The only sideline occupations that could generate income at the moment were doing odd jobs, pushing wheelbarrows, and binding cylinder wood (raw material for papermaking), and these sideline occupations would have to be suspended on rainy days. Obviously, it was difficult to solve the members' borrowing problem with the current sideline income of the cooperative.

　　This day, Wu Chunsi was brooding over his worries when the accountant came. This young man was usually quite lively, but now he frowned and said before the director could speak, "At dawn, the accounting office was crowded with people, and the number of borrowing households has increased from fifty or sixty to more than one hundred and ten. We have to take out at least thirty yuan every day. That's a thousand yuan a month. Can the cooperative afford it?" Wu Chunsi said, "How much has been borrowed already? How much longer can we lend?" The accountant said, "More than two thousand yuan has been lent out, including government loans, otherwise we would not have been able to lend at all. Now, I'm afraid we can't lend for many more days." Wu Chunsi listened, lowered his head, and did not speak for a long time.

　　By April, the cooperative gradually had no money to lend to its members.

　　In the difficult days, when the members saw their empty pigsties, empty chicken coops, and vegetable gardens overgrown with weeds, they complained:

　　"Why don't they let us engage in household sideline occupations..."

　　"Yes, it would be great to grow some melons and vegetables, raise a pig, a chicken, etc., so that we would have vegetables to eat and be able to exchange them for pocket money! But they just don't allow it."

　　"I really don't understand what kind of trick this higher-level cooperative is playing."

　　"Humph! This is the superiority of the higher-level cooperative, isn't it?"

　　In one production team, the seedling transplanting was delayed because the members were in a bad mood due to living difficulties.

　　In another production team, some cotton seedlings died because the members were in a bad mood due to living difficulties.

　　Having discovered these problems, Wu Chunsi felt uneasy and discussed solutions with some management committee members. At this time, a cadre from the Second Production Team rushed over in a panic and said:

　　"Four middle peasant members in our team want to withdraw from the cooperative!"

　　"Why?" Wu Chunsi stood up abruptly and said.

　　"They used to do some small business on the side, and pocket money came easily. Now they see that the cooperative is having difficulty lending money and complain, saying, 'The cooperative is strangling people like this now. Will the distribution be fair in the future! It's better to withdraw from the cooperative early.'"

　　Director Wu sat down dejectedly, anxiously looking at the committee members and saying:

　　"The problem is getting more and more serious, what should we do!"

　　Everyone stared blankly without speaking.

　　Hearing that Comrade Nie, the leader of the working group of the Huangpi County Party Committee, had arrived, Wu Chunsi was both happy and worried; however, the worried mood still prevailed. He thought, "Leading the higher-level cooperative has just started, and so many problems have arisen! Moreover, this higher-level cooperative is still the county party committee's key project and is to be demonstrated throughout the county, but now..." He did not dare to think further. He thought to himself, "Things have come to this point, what else can I do but wait to be scolded!"

　　After understanding the situation of the cooperative, Comrade Nie did not scold him. He knew that the cooperative director, who had been leading a primary cooperative of only twenty or thirty households a few months ago, was now suddenly leading a higher-level cooperative of two or three hundred households. In all respects, he lacked experience, and shortcomings and mistakes in his work were inevitable. He sympathized with his situation. He wanted to help him solve the problem with a warm attitude—to improve his ideological level and working ability through this matter.

　　That night, Comrade Nie talked to Wu Chunsi. He was amiable and his tone was cordial, with not a hint of scolding. This made Wu Chunsi feel completely unexpected. His mood was not as heavy as before. He relaxed his brow, cheered up, and listened attentively to Comrade Nie's conversation. Comrade Nie talked about the importance of combining collective interests with individual interests; he talked about how neglecting the development of household sideline occupations while developing collective sideline occupations was the fundamental reason for the problems currently arising.... He talked until late at night before leaving. Wu Chunsi lay in bed unable to sleep, carefully thinking about Comrade Nie's conversation, and also thinking about the work situation during this period. ...His mind gradually became clear: "Comrade Nie's words make sense, my approach was wrong."

　　The next day, Wu Chunsi convened a management committee meeting. He was short of sleep all night, his mouth was dry, and his head was dizzy. However, he still led the meeting enthusiastically. They reviewed their past work, formulated a comprehensive plan for developing collective and household sideline occupations, and selected full-time personnel to lead sideline production. After the meeting, the management committee also solved some problems raised by the members regarding the development of household sideline occupations. For example, the members generally raised the issue of insufficient time for engaging in household sideline occupations, so they decided to appropriately shorten the overly long agricultural production time, so that the members would have a gap time in the morning and evening to engage in household sideline occupations; the members were worried about the lack of capital for raising pigs and chickens and the difficulty of buying pigs and chickens, so they decided to sell the existing piglets and purchase some more piglets and chickens on credit to the members; the members were afraid of not having money to buy feed for raising pigs, and were afraid of swine fever, so they decided to purchase the members' pig manure at a reasonable price, so that the members would have money to buy feed, and at the same time try to prevent swine fever; the members were worried that there would be no sales channels for future sideline products, so they decided to sign purchase contracts with food companies and supply and marketing cooperatives. ...

　　The members' household sideline production has been going on for two or three months. This day, Wu Chunsi also heard the accountant talk about the members' borrowing situation: "Since the development of household sideline occupations, the number of borrowers has gradually decreased, and now no one is borrowing at all. The burden on the cooperative has been reduced, and the income from collective sideline occupations can be invested in agricultural production." After listening to the report, Wu Chunsi enthusiastically went to the production teams to understand the members' household sideline income. At Wu Tianshan's home, his uncle, a semi-disabled person who managed household sideline occupations, smiled when he saw the cooperative director come in and said, "Our family of eleven uses the rest time in the morning and evening to do all the work of growing vegetables, raising pigs, and raising chickens. The income is not small! Just the vegetables grown, in addition to supplying our own consumption, we sell a load every day, earning seven or eight jiao, and the oil and salt money for the whole family, pocket money for the children, and cigarette money for the adults are all available." Wu Chunsi encouraged him and then went to the home of martyr Wu Anyun. This family of eight had only half a labor force and lived a difficult life, and in the past, they borrowed from the cooperative every day. Now, when Wu Anyun saw him, the first sentence he said was: "We have a way to manage now, and we don't need to borrow from the cooperative." Wu Chunsi saw that they had planted many melons and vegetables, the pigs were fed fat and large, and the chickens were raised with shiny feathers and fleshy balls. He fully understood the meaning of Wu Anyun's words. Wu Anyun specifically mentioned the income from raising chickens, saying: "We raised thirty chickens, and they lay about twenty eggs every day, worth five or six jiao. Just this income solves the oil, salt, and pocket money problems for the whole family."... Wu Chunsi visited one household after another, and the household sideline income of the members was roughly the same as that of the previous members. In the evening, Wu Chunsi heard the full-time personnel in charge of sideline occupations report on the overall situation of household sideline production: One hundred and ten pigs were raised, and there are still sows breeding at present. The number of pigs in the autumn harvest will increase to more than two hundred and thirty, with an average of more than one pig per household. More than three thousand chickens and ducks were raised, with an average of three per person. Nearly two hundred thousand catties of pumpkins have been harvested, equivalent to fifty or sixty thousand catties of rice, which has greatly compensated for the reduction in income due to the poor wheat harvest for the members.

　　Finally, people talked all at once: Since the cooperative led the members to do a good job in household sideline occupations, the members were all satisfied and said: "Now the cooperative cadres care about the lives of the masses, it's really a big transformation!"

　　In the Second and Tenth Production Teams, the production mood of the members was not very good before, but now they are working very hard. They said: "As long as there is something cooking in the pot and something useful in the bag, we are happy to work until dark."

    转变

    晚上，星火农业生产合作社主任吴纯四召开管理委员会研究经营副业生产问题。十多个管理委员陆陆续续的到齐，已经快十点钟了。有些人不停地吸着纸烟，浓重的烟雾从桌边冒起来，翻卷着，熏得人们直呛咳，旁人的发言有点听不清，不过，稍为留意，可以听出大家对经营副业生产都很同意吴纯四的这个意见：为了使社员集中力量搞好农业生产，一切副业由社里经营，不准社员经营家庭副业。
    但是，有少数委员提出了不同的意见：
    “一切副业都由社里包下来，不让社员搞点家庭副业，那就限制得太死了。”
    “不！还是限制死一点好。”管理委员兼生产队长老吴坚决地说，“要是让社员去搞家庭副业，那就麻烦了。比方说，个人种了瓜菜，必然影响干队里的活，同时积的肥料也先上到自己的瓜菜地里，队里的庄稼就要缺乏肥料长不好。再说，个人喂的猪、鸡、鸭等，关照得不好，很容易糟蹋队里的庄稼。现在各队都实行包工包产，要是让社员这样去搞家庭副业，那就得赔产。当队长的负不起这个责任呀！”
    到会的管理委员多半是兼任生产队长的，他们都同意老吴的意见，说：“是啊！家庭副业搞不得——搞了，只有好了个人，糟了集体。”
    吴纯四觉着大家的意见有道理，不过，还没有把问题说透彻。他慢条斯理地说：
      “现在升了高级社了，每个人必须把个人事业看轻些，把集体事业看重些。想想看吧，没有社里的农业生产和副业生产，家庭副业搞得再好，能解决多大问题呢！再说，让社员去搞家庭副业，就等于纵容他们去发展资本主义。这可是个原则错误呀！”
    大家聚精会神地听着，点着头。
    过了几天，吴纯四听到生产队长执行管委会的决议的汇报。他听得津津有味，脸孔堆满笑容，心里直嚷着“做得对”。
    生产队长的汇报是这样的：他们正在积极设法阻止社员经营家庭副业：他们批评那些要求搞家庭副业的人是“资本主义思想”。他们动员喂猪户赶快把猪卖掉，把钱投到社里。在第五生产队里，队长看见一个队员的猪糟蹋庄稼，把它打得四天没有吃食。在第二生产队里，一个队员养的二只鸭子把一个队员的责任田的秧苗吃了一点，随即被打死了。这两件事实，更有力地“教育”了社员放弃经营家庭副业。生产队长还给社主任谈到：由于阻止了社员经营家庭副业，社员为了挣工分，都集中力量搞农业生产，出勤率达95％以上。吴纯四把这些事实一件一件记录下来，准备将来作总结材料。
    社员的家庭副业已经停顿几个月了。人们得不到一点现款收入，不仅底子空虚的人感到开支困难，就是有点积蓄的人，也渐渐把钱花光了。向社里支借油盐钱、零用钱的人越来越多。
    开始，吴纯四并没有把这件事情放在心上。他想：支借就支借吧，有集体副业的收入还怕对付不了。但是，当他摸清集体副业的收入情况后，着急了。原来社里虽然经营了许多副业，现时能得到收入的并不多。比如喂猪、养鱼等比较大宗的副业，都是秋后才有收益的；至于给粮食部门加工酿酒、磨粉，除了可以挣肥料外，收入的加工费刚好够买柴火；现时能够有收益的副业只有做零工、推脚、扎缸柴（造纸的原料）等，而这些副业到了雨天还得停顿下来。显然，想从社里现时的副业收入来解决社员的支借问题是困难的。
    这天，吴纯四正在闷着想心事，会计员来了。这个青年向来是挺活泼的，现在却皱着眉头，没等主任开口就说：“天一亮，会计室就挤满了人，支借户从五、六十户增加到一百一十多户了。每天顶少也得拿出三十多元。一个月就得拿出千把元。这样下去，社里能负担得了？”吴纯四说：“已经支借多少了？还能支借几时？”会计说：“支借出去二千多元了，这里面还包括政府的贷款在内，要不然早就没法支借。现在，恐怕支借不了几天了。”吴纯四听着，低着头，半天没有说话。
    到了4月间，社里已经渐渐没有钱支借给社员了。
    在困难的日子里，社员看见自己的空猪圈、空鸡窝，和长着野草的菜园地，都发出了怨言：
      “为什么不让搞点家庭副业呢……”
      “是呀，种点瓜菜，喂个猪子、鸡子，又有菜吃，又能换个零花钱，多好啊！可就是不让搞。”
      “真不明白这高级社搞的什么名堂。”
      “哼！这就是高级社的优越性吧。”
    有一个生产队，因为社员生活困难闹情绪，把秧苗下迟了。
    另一个生产队也因为社员生活困难闹情绪，把一些棉苗干死了。
    发现了这些问题，吴纯四心情不安地和一些管理委员研究解决的办法。这时，第二生产队一个干部慌张地过来说：
      “我们队里有四户中农社员想退社！”
      “为什么？”吴纯四霍地站起来说。
      “他们过去是捎带做点小生意的，零用钱来得很容易。现在看见社里支借困难，不满地说：‘合作社如今就这样蹩死人，将来分配还能公平吗！不如趁早退社。’”
    吴主任颓然坐下，焦急地望着社委说：
    “问题越来越严重了，该怎么办呢！”
    大家直瞪着眼没说话。
    听说中共黄陂县委工作组长聂同志到来，吴纯四又喜又愁；然而，愁的心情毕竟占了优势。他想：“领导高级社才开了个头，就出了这么多问题！而且，这高级社还是县委的重点，要在全县示范的，现在……”他不敢想下去。寻思着：“事到如今，还有什么办法，等着挨训吧！”
    聂同志了解社里的情况以后，没有训他。他知道：几个月以前还在领导一个二、三十户的初级社的社主任，现在忽然领导一个二、三百户的高级社，从各方面说来，都是经验不足的，工作上的缺点和错误是难免的。他同情他的处境。他要以热情的态度帮助他解决问题——通过这件事情，提高他的思想水平和工作能力。
    这天晚上，聂同志和吴纯四谈话。他态度和蔼，语调亲切，没有一点训人的意思。这使吴纯四感到完全出乎意料。他的心情没有先前那样沉重了。他舒展眉头，抖擞精神，用心地听着聂同志的谈话。聂同志谈到集体利益与个人利益的结合的重要；谈到发展集体副业当中，忽视发展家庭副业就是造成目前发生问题的根本原因……。他一直谈到深夜才出去。吴纯四躺在床上睡不着，仔细想着聂同志的谈话，又想着这一期间的工作情形。……他的脑子渐渐明亮起来：“聂同志的话有道理，自己的做法不对头。”
    第二天，吴纯四召开管理委员会会议。一夜睡眠不足，他嘴干舌燥，头昏脑胀。但是，他仍然兴冲冲地领导会议进行下去。他们检查了过去的工作，制定了发展集体副业和家庭副业的全面规划，选出专职人员领导副业生产。会议以后，管理委员会又根据社员对发展家庭副业提出的一些问题加以解决。比如，社员普遍提出经营家庭副业生产的时间不足，他们就决定适当缩短过长的农业生产时间，使社员在早晚有个空隙时间去搞家庭副业生产；社员顾虑喂猪养鸡没有本钱和购买猪、鸡困难，他们就决定把社里现有的小猪再购买一部分小猪、小鸡赊给社员；社员害怕养猪没有钱买饲料，害怕猪子发瘟，他们就决定以合理的价格收购社员的猪粪，使社员有钱买饲料，同时设法预防猪瘟；社员顾虑将来的副业产品没有销路，他们就决定和食品公司、供销合作社订收购合同。……
    社员的家庭副业生产进行了二、三个月了。这天，吴纯四又听会计员谈到社员的支借情形：“自从发展家庭副业以来，支借的人逐渐减少，现在根本没有人支借了，社里的负担减轻了，集体副业的收益，可以投资到农业生产上去。”听了汇报后，吴纯四兴致勃勃地到生产队里了解社员的家庭副业收益情况。在吴天山的家里，他的叔父，一个管理家庭副业的半残废的人，看见社主任进来，笑咧咧地说：“全家十一口人，每天利用早晚休息时间，把种菜、喂猪、养鸡等全搞起来了。收益可不小呀！单单种的瓜菜，除了供自己吃的外，每天还有一担出售，收入七、八角钱，全家人的油盐钱，小孩的零用钱，大人的香烟钱都有了。”吴纯四把他鼓励了一番，又走到烈属吴安运家里。这家八口人，只有半个劳动力，生活很困难，过去每天都是向社里支借。现在吴安运见他第一句就说：“眼下有办法了，用不着向社里支借了。”吴纯四看见他们种的许多瓜菜，猪喂得又肥又大，鸡养得毛光肉球的，他完全了解吴安运的话的意思。吴安运特别提到养鸡的收益说：“养了三十个鸡，每天生蛋二十个左右，值五、六角钱。单这项收入，就解决了全家的油盐钱和零用钱的问题。”……吴纯四访问了一户又一户，社员的家庭副业收益情况，和前面的社员大致相同，晚上，吴纯四听到副业专职人员汇报家庭副业生产的全面情况：喂猪一百一十头，目前还有母猪正在繁殖，秋后的猪子要发展到二百三十多头，平均每户将喂猪一头多。养鸡鸭三千多只，平均每人养三只，栽的南瓜，已经收下将近二十万斤，折合米五、六万斤，这对于弥补社员因小麦歉收减少收入起了很大作用。
    末了，人们七嘴八舌地谈着：自从社里领导社员搞好家庭副业，社员都满意地说：“现在社干部关心群众生活，真是一个大转变！”
    在第二、第十等生产队里，以前队员的生产情绪是不大好的，现在干得挺起劲。他们说：“只要锅里有煮的，袋里有用的，一天干到黑都高兴。”
