　　Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 20th: The Vietnamese People's Army side lodged a strong protest on the 18th against the intrusion into the Demilitarized Zone by a large number of South Vietnamese troops armed by the United States, demanding that the Vietnam International Commission intervene in this illegal action by the South Vietnamese authorities and order them to immediately withdraw all illegally intruding armed forces from the Demilitarized Zone.
　　The Liaison Delegation of the General Headquarters of the People's Army emphasized in a letter to the International Commission that the South Vietnamese authorities are taking advantage of the fact that the Joint Ceasefire Commission has not been able to carry out normal activities, constantly increasing and deploying armed forces to intrude into the southern part of the Demilitarized Zone and arbitrarily suppressing the people. This situation seriously violates the relevant provisions of the Geneva Accords and the existing regulations of the Central Joint Ceasefire Commission.
　　The Vietnamese People's Army side pointed out in the letter that the South Vietnamese authorities recently even intruded into the Demilitarized Zone with a fully equipped military police battalion, bringing the number of illegally intruding armed personnel to more than five hundred. They openly organized patrols, surrounded villages, cut off routes of communication in the Demilitarized Zone, searched and inspected residents, and arrested former resistance personnel. The letter said that due to these circumstances, the situation in the southern part of the Demilitarized Zone has become increasingly tense and chaotic, and the buffer nature of the area has been seriously violated.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 20th: The Liaison Delegation of the General Headquarters of the Vietnamese People's Army telegraphed the Vietnam International Supervisory and Control Commission working in Saigon on the 19th, once again reminding the Commission to pay sufficient attention to the serious incidents in which the South Vietnamese authorities recently obstructed the investigation of the Vinh Trinh incident twice and organized the beating of Vietnamese liaison officers participating in the investigation. The telegram requested the International Commission to urge the South Vietnamese authorities to immediately cease all obstructing schemes in order to enable the international team to continue its investigation locally. The Liaison Delegation of the Vietnamese People's Army also suggested that the International Commission take measures to ensure that local witnesses of the Vinh Trinh incident can freely appeal to the international team and not be persecuted in the future.
　　Currently in Hanoi, twelve witnesses to the Vinh Trinh incident in South Vietnam, including Li Zheng and Ruan Ju, also wrote to the Vietnam International Commission on the 18th, requesting the Commission to resolutely dispatch an investigation team to the scene of the incident to conduct an investigation, and to find ways to ensure that the local witnesses still remaining in Vinh Trinh have the freedom to meet with the investigation team to state the truth of the incident.

    越方抗议南越侵入非军事区
    要求国际委员会制止南越阻挠调查维川事件
    新华社河内20日电　越南人民军方面在18日对于由美国武装的大批南越军队侵入非军事区的行为提出了强硬抗议，要求越南国际委员会干涉南越当局这种非法行动，要他们把非法侵入的武装部队马上全部撤出非军事区。
    人民军总司令部联络代表团在写给国际委员会的信中强调指出，南越当局利用了联合停战委员会没有能够进行正常活动的情况，不断增调武装部队侵入非军事区南部，恣意镇压人民，这种情况严重地违反了日内瓦协定的有关条款和中央联合停战委员会已有的规定。
    越南人民军方面在信中指出，南越当局在不久以前竟又以一个装备齐全的宪兵大队侵入非军事区，从而使非法入侵的武装人员达到五百名之多。他们公然组织巡逻，包围村落，截断非军事区中的来往路径，搜索和检查居民，逮捕前抗战人员。信件说，由于这些情况，非军事区南部的局势已经日益紧张和混乱，地区的缓冲性质遭到了严重的侵犯。
    新华社河内20日电　越南人民军总司令部联络代表团19日打电报给在西贡工作的越南国际监督和监察委员会，再一次提醒委员会对南越当局最近两次阻挠调查维川事件并且组织殴打参加调查工作的越南联络军官的严重事件给以足够的注意。电报要求国际委员会促使南越当局立即停止一切阻挠的阴谋，以便使国际小组继续在当地进行调查。越南人民军联络代表团并且建议国际委员会采取措施，保证使维川事件的当地人证能够自由向国际小组申诉，并且在以后不遭受迫害。
    目前在河内的南越维川事件人证黎正，阮菊等十二人也在十八日写信给越南国际委员会，要求委员会坚决派遣调查小组到肇事地点进行调查，并且设法保证还留在维川的当地证人有会见调查小组申述事件真相的自由。
