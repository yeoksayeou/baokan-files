Xinhua News Agency, September 6th, Paris Dispatch: The North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council held a special one-day meeting in Paris on September 5th to discuss the Suez Canal issue. The meeting did not adopt any resolutions, and the participating countries did not undertake any obligations.

It is said that this meeting, decided upon not long ago after talks between British Prime Minister Eden and NATO Secretary-General Ismay, aimed to gain support from NATO countries for the Western powers' "international control" plan for the Suez Canal during the negotiations between the "Five-Nation Committee" and Egyptian President Nasser. Before the meeting, British Foreign Secretary Lloyd and French Foreign Minister Pineau held separate talks, deciding that Lloyd would state the positions of Britain and France to the representatives of other countries attending the meeting.

According to meeting participants, during this special session, Lloyd reported on the results of the London Conference, the tasks of the "Five-Nation Committee," and the general situation of the Suez Canal issue. He reiterated Britain's support for the Dulles plan of "international control" of the Suez Canal.

Pineau, in his speech, supported the British viewpoint. He demanded that relevant countries "must demonstrate unwavering firmness" on this issue. He also said that France believed it "must take precautionary military measures."

Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak advocated against making concessions to Egypt. The Turkish representative also made a similar statement.

However, it can be seen from Western news agency reports that although the representatives of the countries attending the meeting "in principle" supported the positions of Britain and France, they did not undertake any obligations regarding possible actions if Egypt rejected the "international control" plan for the Suez Canal. The Associated Press reported that Lloyd's speech did not encounter opposition, but he also "received no answers," and "the meeting did not achieve joint action." United Press International specifically mentioned Greece's "lukewarm attitude" at the meeting.

    北大西洋集团讨论苏彝士运河问题
    与会国家没有对英法承担任何义务
    新华社6日讯　巴黎消息：北大西洋公约集团理事会9月5日在巴黎举行了为期一天的特别会议，讨论苏彝士运河问题。会议没有通过任何决议，与会国家也没有承担任何义务。
    据说，这个在不久前由英国首相艾登和北大西洋公约集团秘书长伊斯迈会谈后决定召开的会议，目的是为了试图在“五国委员会”和埃及总统纳赛尔举行谈判的时候，争取北大西洋公约集团国家对西方三国的“国际管制”苏彝士运河计划的支持。在会议还没有举行以前，英国外交大臣劳埃德和法国外交部长比诺就单独举行了会谈，决定由劳埃德向出席会议的其他国家代表表明英法两国的态度。
    据会议人士透露，在这次特别会议上，劳埃德报告了伦敦会议的结果，“五国委员会”的任务以及苏彝士运河问题的一般情况。他重申英国支持“国际管制”苏彝士运河的杜勒斯方案。
    比诺在发言中支持英国的观点。他要求有关国家在这个问题上“必须表现得坚定不移”。他并且说，法国认为，它“必须采取预防性的军事措施”。
    比利时外交大臣斯巴克主张不要对埃及让步。土耳其代表也作了类似的发言。
    但是，从西方通讯社报道中可以看出，出席会议的各国代表虽然在“原则上”支持英法两国的主张，但是他们对于埃及一旦拒绝“国际管制”苏彝士运河计划时可能采取的行动，并没有承担任何义务。美联社报道指出，劳埃德的发言没有遭到反对，但是他也“没有得到回答”，“会议并没有做到采取联合行动”。合众社还特别谈到希腊在会议上的“冷淡态度”。
