Xinhua News Agency, 10th of September dispatch from Cairo: Talks between the "Five-Nation Suez Canal Committee" and Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser concluded on September 9th without reaching any agreement.

The final meeting between the two sides took place that evening. The joint communique issued after the talks stated that the Committee presented and explained the proposals (Dulles Plan) of the eighteen nations participating in the London Conference on the Suez Canal issue, and the Committee listened to the Egyptian government's views on these proposals.

The communique stated that the Committee will soon leave Cairo and submit the results of the talks to its principals.

Xinhua News Agency, 10th of September dispatch from Cairo: The Egyptian government today suggested organizing a negotiating body sufficiently representative of the diverse opinions of countries using the Suez Canal to resolve the Suez Canal issue.

An official communique from the Egyptian Presidential Office announced a note from the Egyptian government to UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld and various governments.

The note stated that the Egyptian government "now wishes to announce that it believes that ways can be found, without prejudice to Egypt's sovereignty and dignity, to resolve the following issues: A, Freedom and security of navigation of the canal; B, Development of the canal to meet future navigational needs; C, Determination of reasonable and fair tolls and fees."

The note said that these issues are related to all countries using the canal. The Egyptian government believes that it is possible, and should be attempted, to resolve the above issues through peaceful negotiations.

To achieve this goal, the Egyptian government suggests taking immediate steps to organize a negotiating body sufficiently representative of the diverse opinions of countries using the canal, and that discussions should be held immediately to resolve the membership, location, and date of meetings of such a body.

This organization may also undertake the task of revising the 1888 Constantinople Convention.

The note reviewed the various meetings and talks held so far to discuss the Suez Canal issue, and mentioned the military threats implemented by Britain and France.

The note pointed out that there have been no direct negotiations with Egypt so far.

The note stated that the Egyptian government regrets that certain countries have conducted military exercises to confront Egypt and have attempted to obstruct the passage of the Suez Canal by trying to influence the technical personnel of the canal to leave their jobs or refuse to work.

Despite this, the Egyptian government and people have remained calm and clear-headed and are determined to keep the canal open and unobstructed.

The note concluded: "Egypt wishes to state its determination to continue its efforts within the letter and spirit of the United Nations Charter in order to resolve this issue through negotiation."
