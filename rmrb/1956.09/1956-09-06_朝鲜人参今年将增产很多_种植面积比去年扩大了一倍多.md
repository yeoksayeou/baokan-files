Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, September 4th: North Korea will begin harvesting ginseng in mid-September. This year's ginseng production will exceed previous years, and the export volume of ginseng will also increase significantly.

According to the "Labor News" report, the Kaesong area, which has historically been the center of ginseng cultivation in Korea and was newly liberated, currently has a ginseng field area of ​​two million pyeong (one pyeong equals 3.3 square meters). This year, the ginseng farms here plan to increase production by 10% compared to last year.

In order to restore and develop ginseng production, the North Korean government has issued a large number of loans this year, with loans to individual ginseng farmers alone amounting to 9.3 million won.

This year, state-owned ginseng farms have expanded by 138% compared to 1955, and private ginseng fields have expanded by 116%. The ginseng fields of agricultural production cooperatives have also increased by 60,000 pyeong.

At the same time, scientific research on increasing yields is also making great progress. An experimental ginseng field has been established to test different methods of cultivating two-year-old ginseng roots.

Large-scale ginseng cultivation in North Korea began in the early 18th century. During the Japanese occupation and the Syngman Rhee regime, this precious medicinal material was one of their main targets for plunder. During the Korean War, more than 5% of the ginseng fields were abandoned due to bombing by American planes.

    朝鲜人参今年将增产很多
    种植面积比去年扩大了一倍多
    据新华社平壤4日电　朝鲜将在9月月中开始采掘人参。今年人参的产量将超过往年，人参的出口量也将大大增加。
    据“劳动新闻”报道，新解放的自古以来就是朝鲜种植人参的中心的开城地区，目前参田面积共有二百万坪（一坪合三·三平方公尺）。今年，这里的参场计划要使产量比去年增加10％。
    为了恢复和发展人参的生产，朝鲜政府今年发放了大量贷款，单是贷给个体种植人参的农民的贷款就有九百三十万圆。
    今年，国营参场比1955年扩大了138％，私人参田扩大了116％。农业生产合作社的参田也增加了六万坪。
    同时，关于提高产量的科学研究工作也正在取得很大的进展。一块实验参田已经建立起来，用不同的方法试验培植两年参龄的参根。
    朝鲜大规模的种植人参是在十八世纪初叶开始的。在日本占领时期和在李承晚统治时期，这种珍贵的药材是他们掠夺的主要对象之一。在朝鲜解放战争期间，曾有5％以上的参田因美国飞机的轰炸而荒废。
