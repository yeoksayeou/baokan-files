Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd -- The 2,120,000 mu of spring maize in Xuzhou Prefecture, Jiangsu Province, have yielded a bumper harvest. Preliminary calculations show an average yield of 210 jin per mu, an increase of nearly 70% compared to last year. In the third cooperative of the Hongguang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Gengji Township, Tongshan County, a 2.5 mu high-yield plot yielded 1,388 jin per mu. In Suining County, there were 2,481 mu of maize fields yielding over 1,000 jin per mu. Fengxian and Ganyu Counties also reported fields yielding over 1,000 jin. This year marked the first time maize was planted in the western plains of Weishan Lake. In the areas along the Yi River and Shu River, where maize has been grown for many years, news of bumper harvests is spreading everywhere.

Xuzhou Prefecture is one of the important grain-producing areas in Jiangsu Province, mainly consisting of dry land. This year, after replacing low-yield crops with high-yield crops, the area sown with spring maize increased by 860,000 mu. The average yield per mu increased by about 95% compared to last year's sorghum. This single result of changing the farming system allows Xuzhou Prefecture to produce over 87.7 million jin more grain. Many counties and districts have maize stalks that are thick and robust, with some plants bearing two or three ears. The larger ears weigh about a jin each, which farmers call "ox horns" or "wine bottles."

    徐州专区春播玉米丰收
    比种低产作物可多收八千多万斤粮食
    新华社南京2日电　江苏省徐州专区二百一十二万亩春播玉米普遍丰收，初步计算每亩平均产量达二百一十斤，比去年增产近七成。铜山县耿集乡红光农业生产合作社第三社的二亩半丰产田，每亩收了一千三百八十八斤；睢宁县每亩超过千斤的玉米田，有二千四百八十一亩；丰县、赣榆等县都出现了千斤丰产田。微山湖西部平原今年第一次种植了玉米，多年种植玉米的沂河、沭河两岸地区，处处传报丰收喜讯。
    徐州专区是江苏省重要粮产区之一，主要是旱田。今年改种低产作物为高产作物后，春播玉米面积增加了八十六万亩，每亩平均产量比去年种高粱时增加95％左右，单是这一项改变耕作制度的结果，徐州专区就可以多产八千七百七十多万斤粮食。许多县区的玉米秆粗大，一棵连生双穗或三穗，穗子大的达一斤左右，农民称之为“牛角”、“酒瓶”。
