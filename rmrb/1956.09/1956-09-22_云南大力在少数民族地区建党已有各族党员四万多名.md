    Kunming, September 21st (By our own reporter) - Yunnan Province already has 46,823 Party members from minority ethnic groups, accounting for 0.83% of the total minority population in the province. This includes 119 branches of dozens of ethnic groups such as Yi, Bai, Dai, Zhuang, Miao, Hui, Hani, and Naxi, accounting for 84% of the known ethnic branches. Because these Party members play a backbone and leading role in various socialist construction undertakings, and also well reflect the opinions and demands of their own ethnic groups, they have greatly expanded the Party's political influence in minority areas and strengthened the ties between the Party and the people of all ethnic groups. Many ethnic groups regard the joining of outstanding figures from their own ethnicity into the Party as a great happy event. Some townships even use the most solemn rituals of their ethnic customs to celebrate the establishment of Party branches.
