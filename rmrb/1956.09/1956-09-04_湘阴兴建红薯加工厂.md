According to the New Hunan Daily, a semi-mechanized sweet potato processing plant is under construction in Xiangyin County, which is rich in sweet potatoes. The earthwork for the factory began in mid-August, and the technical design is nearing completion. It is expected to be completed and put into production by the end of this year.

After the factory is built, it will process fresh sweet potatoes, which are easily perishable and inconvenient for long-distance transportation and sales, into sweet potato flour for consumption by people in various regions and for use as industrial raw materials. The factory will be equipped with new mechanical equipment such as sweet potato washing machines, grinders, and water pumps. The production process, from washing sweet potatoes to grinding them into sweet potato flour, will be semi-mechanized. The initial plan is to process more than 9 million jin of fresh sweet potatoes in four months, and with other miscellaneous grains (potatoes, etc.), it will be able to process about 30 million jin throughout the year.

    湘阴兴建红薯加工厂
    据新湖南报讯　在盛产红薯的湘阴县，一座半机械化的红薯加工厂正在兴建中。这个厂的土方工程8月中旬已经开始，技术设计也接近完成。预计今年年底就可以建成并投入生产。
    这座工厂建成后，它将把很容易腐烂、不便长距离运销的新鲜红薯，加工成薯粉，供应各地人民食用和做工业原料用。这座工厂将安装洗薯机、磨粉机、抽水机等新式机械设备，从洗薯到磨制成薯粉，生产过程是半机械操作的。初步计划它在四个月内就能够加工新鲜红薯九百多万斤，再加上其他杂粮（马铃薯等），全年将可以加工三千万斤左右。
