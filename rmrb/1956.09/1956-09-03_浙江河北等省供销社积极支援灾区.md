Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Supply and marketing cooperatives in Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Anhui, Hebei, and other provinces are actively organizing the supply of materials to help people in disaster areas overcome their living difficulties and carry out reconstruction.

According to information from the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives, since Zhejiang Province was hit by a typhoon, it has successively purchased over 22,000 dan (a unit of weight) and over 20 train cars of various vegetables and other large quantities of non-staple foods from within the province and from Shanghai, Beijing, Zhangjiakou, and other places, providing them to the people in the disaster areas for timely consumption. Supply and marketing cooperatives in the waterlogged areas of Hebei Province have also vigorously carried out the supply of various materials. Many grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives have also used methods such as carrying on their backs and shoulders, using pack animals, and transporting by boat, depending on the different water conditions, to ensure the continuous supply of materials to the disaster areas. They also provided credit sales to disaster victims with financial difficulties. Supply and marketing departments in other disaster-stricken provinces and regions have also promptly carried out the supply of cooked food and non-staple foods.

Great achievements have also been made in the supply of building materials. After Anhui Province and eighteen counties including Hexian and Tongcheng obtained large quantities of building materials such as timber, moso bamboo, and reed mats, 30% of the collapsed houses were quickly repaired. Zhejiang Province is also actively organizing the transfer and transportation of more than 10 million bricks and tiles and other various building materials to supply the disaster areas. Jiangsu Province has also promptly allocated a large amount of moso bamboo to severely typhoon-affected areas to support disaster victims in building houses.

    浙江河北等省供销社积极支援灾区
    据新华社讯　浙江、江苏、安徽、河北等省的供销合作社，积极组织物资供应，帮助灾区人民克服生活困难和进行恢复建设。
    据从供销合作总社了解，浙江省在遭受台风袭击以来，已先后从省内和上海、北京、张家口等地采购了二万二千多担又二十多个车皮的各种蔬菜和其他大量副食品，及时供应灾区人民食用。河北省遭受水涝地区的供销社，也都大力进行了各种物资的供应工作，许多基层的供销社，还根据不同的水情，运用人背肩挑、牲口驮和用船运的方法，保证灾区物资的不断供应。对经济困难的灾民，还实行了赊销。其他受灾省区的供销部门，也都及时开展了熟食和副食品的供应工作。
    在建筑材料的供应上，也获得了很大成绩。安徽省和县、桐城等十八个县在得到了大量木材、毛竹、芦席等建筑材料后，倒塌的房屋中，就有30％很快修复起来。浙江省供应灾区的一千多万块砖、瓦和其他各种建筑材料，也正在积极组织调运。江苏省对遭受台风灾害严重的地区，也及时调拨了大批毛竹支援灾民修建房屋。
