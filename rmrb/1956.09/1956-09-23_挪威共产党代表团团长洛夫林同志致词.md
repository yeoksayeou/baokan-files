Comrades!

On behalf of the Central Committee of the Norwegian Communist Party, I extend the warmest greetings to the glorious Chinese Communist Party.

We salute the Party that leads the historic transformation of China from an economically backward country to an advanced industrial nation. We firmly believe that the Chinese Communist Party, filled with the firm will to serve the people and protecting and promoting the excellent cultural traditions of the Chinese people, will certainly be able to accomplish this task.

China's socialist construction, the establishment of socialist production and economy, is of great significance to the working class and all working people of our country, and to the Norwegian Communist Party. As a new and great member of the big family of socialist countries, China under the leadership of the victorious Chinese Communist Party has once again proved the correctness of Marxism-Leninism, and the correctness of the theory of the socialist system that eliminates exploitation, oppression, and disaster.

We salute the Chinese people for their great efforts for the sacred cause of peace. We have always understood that the Chinese people were, are, and remain permanent and steadfast friends of peace, and we fully support China's right to have its seat in international organizations such as the United Nations.

Although Norway is one of the countries drawn into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Norwegian people have always given broad support to China's reasonable demands. This is also reflected in the fact that the Norwegian government, under the influence of popular sentiment, has recognized China and established diplomatic relations with you.

At present, the main task of our Norwegian Communist Party is to promote the unity of the working class in the struggle to realize the economic and social demands of the working people. Under the current circumstances, in order to complete this task, it is necessary to oppose the upper-level leaders of the Social Democratic Party, because they still have a great influence on the working masses, primarily through the trade union leadership.

The second task is to mobilize all the Norwegian people to contribute to the disintegration of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, so that our country can regain its independence. In this way, we create conditions for the people's growing efforts to safeguard the cause of peace.

As we heartily congratulate the Chinese people and the Chinese Communist Party on the victory in the struggle against the imperialist oppressors and their agents in China, we wish the Chinese Communist Party—the leader of your country's liberation struggle and the leader of today's great transformation and socialist construction—happiness and glory.

Long live peaceful cooperation and understanding among the people of all countries!

Long live the invincible thought of Marxism-Leninism!

Long live the Chinese Communist Party! (Attached picture)

    挪威共产党代表团团长洛夫林同志致词同志们！
    我代表挪威共产党中央委员会，向光荣的中国共产党致以最热烈的敬礼。
    我们向领导把中国由经济落后的国家建成先进工业国的历史性转变的党致敬。我们坚信，满怀着为人民群众服务的坚定意志，保护和发扬中国人民优秀文化传统的中国共产党，是一定能够完成这一任务的。
    中国的社会主义建设，社会主义的生产和经济的建立，无论对于我国工人阶级和全体劳动人民，和对于挪威共产党都有着重大的意义。作为社会主义国家大家庭的新的和伟大的一员，在胜利的中国共产党领导之下的中国，又一次证明了马克思列宁主义的正确性，证明了消灭剥削、压迫和灾难的社会主义制度的理论的正确性。
    我们向对于神圣的和平事业作出巨大努力的中国人民致敬。我们一直很了解，中国人民过去是、现在仍然是和平的永久的坚定的朋友，我们完全支持中国有权在国际组织如联合国获得它的席位的要求。
    虽然挪威是被拉入北大西洋集团的国家之一，但挪威人民对中国的合理要求总是给予广泛的支持。这也表现在挪威政府，在人民情绪的影响之下，承认了中国并与你们建立了外交关系。
    目前我们挪威共产党的主要任务，是促进工人阶级在实现劳动人民的经济和社会要求的斗争中团结一致。在目前情况下，要完成这个任务，必须反对社会民主党少数的上层领袖，因为他们首先通过工会领导对工人群众还有很大的影响。
    第二个任务就是动员全体挪威人民为瓦解北大西洋集团作出贡献，使我们国家重新获得独立。我们就这样为人民维护和平事业的日益增长的努力创造条件。
    当我们衷心地祝贺中国人民和中国共产党反对帝国主义压迫者及其在中国的代理人的斗争胜利的时候，谨祝中国共产党——你们国家解放斗争的领导者和今天伟大的转变和社会主义建设的领导者幸福和光荣。
    各国人民之间的和平合作和谅解万岁！
    战无不胜的马克思列宁主义思想万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！（附图片）
