Is It Appropriate to "Pass On" Readers' Letters Like This?

The speed at which people's letters are passed on has recently increased, but the problems raised by readers are often not resolved as a result. The People's Daily Editorial Department forwarded a letter from readers Zheng Jianru and 15 others "requesting a solution to the housing problem for employees of the Fuxin Mine" to the General Office of the Liaoning Provincial People's Committee on July 31. On August 14, the General Office of the Liaoning Provincial People's Committee forwarded it to the Fuxin People's Committee. On August 17, the Fuxin Municipal People's Committee Office "passed on" this letter to the Fuxin Workers' Daily, requesting the Fuxin Workers' Daily to handle it or propose solutions. This letter traveled for eighteen days, which is not too long. However, the Fuxin Workers' Daily is neither the competent authority nor the housing department, so how can it solve the housing problem for employees of the Fuxin Mine?

Editor's Note: We will continue to improve the work of handling readers' letters to promptly solve readers' problems. We also hope that the Fuxin Municipal People's Committee Office will seriously handle Zheng Jianru's and others' letters and not push it to the Fuxin Workers' Daily.

We Need Both Criticism and Praise

Since the People's Daily was redesigned, there have been more critical articles, which is good. However, I feel that we are not doing enough to publicize good deeds and good people, especially those cadres who work diligently, thoroughly, and are supported and loved by the masses. In fact, there are many people and things worth praising. For example, our Mayor Ge Jing of Changde City pays great attention to the opinions of the masses. We wrote to him reflecting that the city's traffic rules were not being well enforced, and the city organized street propaganda and held traffic police responsible, and the city's traffic order quickly improved. We reflected on the service attitude of the catering industry, and the city immediately conducted inspections and urged relevant departments to improve their work. This alone is worthy of praise. There are countless good leaders and staff members across the country, so why does the newspaper praise so few? Xie Shenghong

Judicial Work Is Underreported

The fourth page of the People's Daily is the domestic political page, but this page rarely reports on judicial work. Since the promulgation of the People's Court Organization Law, people's courts at all levels have implemented trial systems such as jury, public trial, collegial panel, and defense, which are unprecedented legal changes that must be understood by every citizen. I hope the newspaper will publish more materials reflecting judicial activities and introducing trial experience, and also criticize certain judicial organs for not acting in accordance with the law.

Do Cows Lie Down to Nurse?

In the article "Little Cow Seedlings" written by Hanzi, published on the eighth page of the People's Daily on August 22, it was mentioned: "There are happy cows lying down and nursing with their eyes closed." Do cows lie down to nurse? I have personally dealt with cows for twenty or thirty years, but I have never seen a cow lying down to nurse a calf. Cows, mares, and donkeys all nurse standing up.

    这样“照转”读者来信是适当的吗？
    人民来信照转旅行的速度最近是加快了，但读者提出的问题往往并没有因此得到解决。人民日报编辑部把读者郑鉴如等十五人“要求解决阜新矿职工住宅问题”的来信，在7月31日转给辽宁省人民委员会办公厅；8月14日辽宁省人民委员会办公厅又把它转给阜新人民委员会；8月17日，阜新市人民委员会办公室又把这封信“照转”给阜新工人报，要求阜新工人报进行处理或提出处理意见。这封信历经十八天旅行，时间并不太长，可是，阜新工人报既不是主管部门，又不是房产部门，怎么能够解决阜新矿职工的住宅问题呢？
    阜新工人报读者来信组
    编者按：我们将不断改进处理读者来信的工作，以便及时解决读者的问题。我们也希望阜新市人民委员会办公室郑重处理郑鉴如等的来信，不要推给阜新工人报去办理。
    要批评也要表扬
    人民日报改版以来，批评稿件增多了，这是好的。但是我觉得在宣扬好人好事方面还做得不够，特别是对那些工作踏实、深入，为群众所拥护、所爱戴的干部表彰得太少了。其实，值得表彰的人和事是很多的。比如我们常德市的市长葛敬，对群众意见很重视。我们去信向他反映市内交通规则执行得不够好，市里就组织力量作街头宣传，责成交通警察负起责任来，市内交通秩序迅速有了改善。我们反映了饮食业的服务态度问题，市里马上进行了检查，督促有关部门改进了工作。单就这一点来说，就是值得表扬的。全国不知有多少好的领导者和工作人员，报纸为什么表扬得那样少呢？　谢盛鸿
    司法工作报道得太少了
    人民日报第四版是国内政治版，但是这一版很少报道司法工作。自从人民法院组织法颁布以后，各级人民法院实行了陪审、公判、合议、辩护等审判制度，这是历来未有的法制变革，必须让每个公民领会。希望报纸多登载一些反映司法活动、介绍审判经验的材料，对于某些司法机关不按法办事也要提出批评。　常立民
    母牛会躺着喂奶吗？
    8月22日人民日报第八版刊登的菡子写的“小牛秧子”一文中提到：“有幸福地眯着眼睛躺着喂奶的母牛”。牛会躺着喂奶吗？我亲身同牛打交道也有二、三十年了，但是还从来没有见过母牛能躺着喂小牛呢。母牛以及母马、驴都是立着喂奶的。　史粹儒
