Xinhua News Agency, September 5th, Canberra Dispatch: Australian Acting Prime Minister Arthur Fadden denied in Parliament on September 4th that the Australian government was preparing to use Australian troops for the Suez Canal issue. He said that the cabinet had not even considered the issue at all.

Fadden made these remarks in response to a question from Opposition Leader H.V. Evatt regarding comments made by Army Minister John Cramer on September 1st. Cramer had said that if troops were to be used in the Suez Canal issue, a fully equipped Australian battalion was ready.

According to Australian newspapers, before Fadden spoke in Parliament, Prime Minister Menzies, who is currently in Cairo for talks with Egyptian President Nasser, sent a telegram criticizing the possible international consequences of Cramer's statement. The "Melbourne Herald" reported that Menzies was angry about Cramer's remarks.

Fadden also said in the House of Representatives on the same day that he was unaware of any agreement regarding the stationing of Australian troops in Cyprus.

    澳代总理否认准备为苏彝士运河问题出兵
    据新华社5日讯　堪培拉消息：澳大利亚代理总理阿瑟·费登9月4日在议会中否认澳大利亚政府准备为苏彝士运河问题使用澳大利亚军队。他说，内阁甚至根本没有考虑过这个问题。
    费登是在答复反对党领袖伊瓦特的时候说这些话的。伊瓦特就陆军部长约翰·克雷默在9月1日所说的话提出了质询。克雷默曾经说，如果在苏彝士运河问题上要使用部队的话，澳大利亚的一个装备齐全的营已经准备好了。
    据澳大利亚报纸报道，在费登在议会说这话以前，目前，正在开罗同埃及总统纳赛尔会谈的孟席斯总理拍来了一份电报，对于克雷默的说法可能在国际上引起的后果，提出了责难。“墨尔本先驱报”记者说，孟席斯对于克雷默发表的谈话感到生气。
    费登同一天在众议院还说，他不知道有任何关于在塞浦路斯驻扎澳大利亚军队的协定。
