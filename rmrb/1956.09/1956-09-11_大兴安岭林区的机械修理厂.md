Xinhua News Agency, Yakeshi, 8th. A mechanical repair plant officially went into production in the Yituli River forest area of the Greater Khingan Range in early September. This plant will overhaul nineteen timber skidding tractors in September.

The Yitu River Mechanical Repair Plant began construction last year, and the main plant building, boiler room, and power generation room were completed in July of this year. The newly expanded forging, cleaning, and other workshops will also be completed before the end of the year.

This factory has the scale of a medium-sized repair plant, equipped with more than 50 repair machines such as connecting rod bearing boring lathes, cold and hot grinding machines, and universal electrical test benches. It can overhaul 15 to 20 cars or tractors per month. It only takes seven days for a vehicle to go from entering the factory to leaving.

This mechanical repair plant was established to adapt to the mechanized production of the Greater Khingan Range forest industry. Now, all processes of the Greater Khingan Range forest industry have used machinery.
