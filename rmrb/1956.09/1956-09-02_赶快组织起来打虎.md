    Masses' Voice
    
    Organize Quickly to Fight Tigers
    
    This year, when we went to work at Chumi Agricultural Cooperative in the Third District of Tongzi County, Guizhou Province, some cooperative members reported to us that incidents of tigers eating people frequently occur in villages such as Jiuba, Zhuangzi, and Shijingping around the cooperative. It is said that from last year to this year, about seventeen or eighteen people have been eaten or injured by tigers. Due to the ferocity of the tigers, it affects farmers' work in the fields. They hope that Tongzi County will quickly lead the local farmers to organize tiger hunting teams to capture and kill the fierce tigers, so as to protect the safety of the lives of the masses of farmers.

    赶快组织起来打虎
    今年我们到贵州桐梓县三区楚米农业社去工作时，有些社员向我们反映：该社周围的九坝、庄子、十井坪等村庄，时常发生老虎吃人的事情。据说，从去年到今年被老虎吃掉和咬伤的约有十七、八人。由于老虎逞凶，影响农民下田劳动。希望桐梓县赶快领导当地农民组织打虎队，捕打猛虎，以保障农民群众生命的安全。
