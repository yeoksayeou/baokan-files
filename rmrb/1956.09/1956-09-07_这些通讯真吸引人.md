    These Articles Are Truly Captivating
    Recently, I have often heard people say, "Some of the articles in the People's Daily are truly captivating." Xiao Qian's "The People on Phoenix Slope," and Huang Guliu's "Old News and New Events in Zhanjiang," give us a feeling of being there.
    I hope that writers will write more of these features and articles for the newspaper.　　Wang Zugao

    这些通讯真吸引人
    最近，我经常听到人们在谈论着：“人民日报有些通讯真吸引人”。萧乾的“凤凰坡上的人们”，黄谷柳的“旧闻新事话湛江”，使我们有身临其境之感。
    希望作家们更多地为报纸写这种特写和通讯。　　汪祖高
