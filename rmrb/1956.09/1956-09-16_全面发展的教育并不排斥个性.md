　　All-Round Education Does Not Exclude Individuality
　　Zhang Jian
　　In order to raise the cultural level of the people nationwide, various regions are now eliminating illiteracy in batches and phases. One higher education institution is also unwilling to stand outside the "literacy campaign," but what they are eliminating is not "illiteracy" but "dance illiteracy." They are forcing students who are unwilling to dance to learn to dance. The rationale for eliminating illiteracy is understood by everyone; why eliminate "dance illiteracy"? This is puzzling. These people also say with great confidence that they are earnestly implementing the education policy of all-round development.
　　Does this mean that in order to implement the education policy of all-round development, one can make uniformly demanding requests of any student in any area? The answer should be no. The principles of communist education tell us that in order to eliminate the various ills of capitalist society (old China was a semi-colonial and semi-feudal society) such as the opposition between physical and mental labor, the separation of theory from practice, and the separation of science and technology from politics, it is necessary to implement in schools at all levels of socialist society an education of healthy development of physical and mental labor, linking theory with practice, and all-round development of individuality that combines science and technology with politics, so as to cultivate new people for socialist society who can develop healthily in terms of intellectual, moral, comprehensive technical, physical, and aesthetic education.
　　In the process of implementing this individualized all-round development education, schools at all levels should put forward unified common requirements for the younger generation that reflect the needs of the entire society. For example, schools at all levels generally have teaching plans, teaching syllabuses, and textbooks, and guarantee the achievement of these requirements through various teaching methods and examination systems. At the same time, based on the specific characteristics of young people, on the premise of basically meeting the common requirements of society for education, each student is allowed to develop their own different interests and special talents. That is to say, while cultivating students' collectivist spirit, students' individuality should also be appropriately developed.
　　Why does communist education develop students' individuality? In class society, people not only have commonality, that is, people's class nature, but also due to the influence of various different factors in the social historical conditions and people's physiological and psychological development, people of the same class or different classes have their own not completely identical individuality. Although people's individuality is subordinate to people's class nature, the two cannot be completely equated. For educators, it is necessary to not only have a class perspective, but also to teach students according to their aptitude and develop individuality in collective life. This is not only beneficial to the individual, but also in line with the interests of society. In socialist society, the principle of people's lives is "from each according to his ability, to each according to his work"; the principle of life in communist society is "from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs." The "ability" mentioned here should be understood as including the expression of each person's individuality in creative labor, that is, each person's hobbies, interests, and special talents. We want to guarantee that the broad masses of people can freely develop their individuality in common life. What we oppose is the self-serving individuality of the exploiting classes that violates public interests. Our opposition to the individuality of the exploiters is precisely in order to further enable the broad masses of people to freely develop their individuality in common life, rather than opposing the development of the individuality of the broad masses of people with the petty-bourgeois egalitarian viewpoint, that is, the viewpoint of obliterating the development of individuality in common life.
　　In colleges and universities, some comrades one-sidedly understand the education policy of "all-round development" and "three goods," regarding "all-round development" as "average development," and not differentiating between the different situations of students, demanding that they make equal progress in all courses in an egalitarian manner. This obliterates the individuality and characteristics of students, and also creates an excessive learning burden and an excessively tense life.
　　Learning is a complex and arduous mental labor. The characteristic of this mental labor is that it not only requires collective forms, such as class teaching, but also requires each student's independent thinking and integration, and gradual progress, that is, it must also be carried out through individual self-study. Although class is the basic mode of teaching in modern schools, it does not exclude the importance of individual self-study. Therefore, in terms of the arrangement of study time in colleges and universities, although the time for classes is more in the first year than the time for individual self-study, it will gradually decrease each year, especially in the higher grades, the proportion of individual self-study time is greater. In class, each student will have different levels of acceptance and speed of understanding of the teacher's lectures. If the reasonable arrangement of students' self-study time and energy in the entire teaching process is ignored, and the same requirements are made of different students in and out of class, it will also limit the development of students' individuality. As for engaging in competitions, movements, and class collectives, etc., it is not suitable for the characteristics of mental labor in school education, because it easily encourages formalism and creates an abnormal state of excessive mental tension.
　　How should we solve the problem of neglecting students' individualized all-round development in higher education? First of all, we must vigorously change the practice of schools engaging in movements, overcome the situation of students' learning and life being too tense, change students' mechanical and rigid lives, so that students have more ample freely disposable time to digest and consolidate the knowledge and skills they have learned, and reasonably develop their hobbies and strengths, and exercise and cultivate students' ability to think independently. Secondly, necessary improvements should be made in the content and methods of teaching, to streamline the number and content of courses, thereby reducing the number of class hours, and to streamline some unnecessary teaching methods, such as reducing or eliminating problem-solving classes and reducing the number and duration of examinations, etc. Furthermore, extra-curricular activities of students should be appropriately streamlined, and it is necessary to ensure that each student has the necessary time for self-study and rest; based on the principle of students' voluntariness and taking into account each person's hobbies and strengths, they should be allowed to carry out appropriate and necessary extra-curricular activities, and the practice of making uniformly demanding requests and practices of anyone and everyone should be opposed.

    全面发展的教育并不排斥个性
    张健
    为了提高全国人民的文化水平，现在各地正在分批分期地扫除文盲。有一个高等学校，也不愿意站在“扫盲”之外，不过他们扫的不是“文盲”，而是“舞盲”，他们强使那些不愿意跳舞的学生学跳舞。扫除文盲的道理，谁都懂得；为什么要扫除“舞盲”？这就令人难解。这些人还理直气壮地说，他们是在认真地贯彻全面发展的教育方针。
    难道说，为了贯彻全面发展的教育方针，就可以对任何学生在任何方面都提出强求一律的要求吗？答复应该是否定的。共产主义教育原理告诉我们：为了消灭资本主义社会（旧中国是半殖民地半封建社会）体力劳动同智力劳动的对立、理论脱离实际、科学技术同政治分离的种种恶果，就要求在社会主义社会的各级学校中，实施体力劳动和智力劳动的健全发展、理论联系实际、科学技术结合政治的个性全面发展的教育，以便为社会主义社会培养出在智育、德育、综合技术教育、体育、美育等方面都能够健全发展的新人。
    各级学校在实施这种个性全面发展的教育过程中，对于年青一代要提出统一的反映整个社会需要的共同要求。例如各级学校一般的都要有教学计划、教学大纲和课本教材，并且通过各种教学方法和考试考查制度来保证达到这种要求。同时，要根据青少年的具体特点，在基本上达到社会对教育的共同要求的前提下，允许每个学生发展各自不同的兴趣和特殊才能。也就是说，在培养学生的集体主义精神的同时，也要适当地发展学生的个性。
    共产主义教育为什么要发展学生的个性呢？在阶级社会里，人们不仅有共同性，即人的阶级性，还由于社会历史条件和人们生理、心理的发育过程中种种不同因素的影响，又构成了同一阶级或者不同阶级之间的人们各自有不完全相同的个性。虽然人们的个性从属于人们的阶级性，但是两者之间还不能完全划上等号。对于教育工作者来说，不但要有阶级观点，而且要因材施教，发展集体生活中的个性。这不仅对个人有利，而且也是符合社会的利益的。在社会主义社会，人们的生活原则是“各尽所能，按劳取酬”；共产主义社会的生活原则是“各尽所能，各取所需”。这里所说的“各尽所能”的“能”字，应该理解为包括发挥各人在创造性的劳动中的个性，即每人的爱好、志趣和特殊的才能。我们要保障这种广大人民能够自由发展其在共同生活中的个性。我们反对的是剥削阶级的那种损人利己、违反公共利益的个性。我们反对剥削者的个性正是为了进一步使广大人民自由发展他们在共同生活中的个性，而不是用小资产阶级的平均主义观点即抹煞共同生活中个性发展的观点，来反对广大人民的个性发展。
    在高等学校中有的同志片面地了解“全面发展”和“三好”的教育方针，把“全面发展”当作“平均发展”，不区别学生的不同情况，平均主义地要求他们各门功课齐头并进。这样就抹煞了学生的个性和特点，而且造成学习负担过重，生活过分紧张。
    学习是一种复杂的艰巨的脑力劳动。这种脑力劳动的特点，它不仅要采取集体的例如班级教学的形式，而且它还要求通过每个学生的独立思考和融会贯通，并且循序渐进，即它又要通过个人自学的方式来进行。上课虽然是近代学校教学的基本方式，但是它并不排斥个人自学的重要性。所以高等学校在学习时间的安排方面，上课的时间比起个人自学的时间一年级虽然多些，但逐年会减少些，尤其是高年级，个人自学时间占的比重更大。在上课的时候，每个学生对于教师讲课的接受能力还会有多少和快慢的不同。如果忽视在整个教学过程中学生自学的时间和精力的合理安排，在课内和课外对不同的学生也提出同样的要求，也会限制学生的个性发展。至于搞竞赛、搞运动和搞班集体等等，也不适合学校教育脑力劳动的特点，因为它容易助长形式主义，造成精神上过分紧张的不正常状态。
    究竟怎样来解决目前高等教育中忽视学生个性全面发展的问题呢？首先要大力改变学校搞运动的作风，克服学生学习和生活过分紧张的状况，改变学生机械刻板的生活，使学生有较充裕的自由支配的时间，消化、巩固所学的知识和技能，并且合理地发挥自己的爱好和特长，锻炼和培养学生独立思考的能力。其次就要从教学内容和教学方法上进行必要的改进，要精简课程的门数和内容，从而减少上课的时数，要精简一些不必要的教学方式，如减少或取消习题课和减少考试考查的次数、时数等等。再就是要适当地精简学生的课外活动，要保证每个学生有必要的自学和休息的时间；要依据学生自愿的原则和照顾各人的爱好、特长，让他们进行适当的必要的课外活动，反对对任何事、任何人都提出强求一律的要求和做法。
