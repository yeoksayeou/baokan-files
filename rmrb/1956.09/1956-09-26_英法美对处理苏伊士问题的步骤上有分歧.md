Xinhua News Agency, 25th. Western news agencies and newspapers continue to report on the disagreements among Britain, France, and the United States on the steps to deal with the Suez Canal issue.

    U.S. State Department officials said on the 24th that the United States is still waiting for Britain to "clarify" Britain and France's intentions to submit the Suez Canal issue to the United Nations. International News Service reported that Washington experts also felt "bewildered" by Britain's emphasis on the Security Council's agreement to the eighteen-nation "international control" canal plan.

    It is reported that the French government's "disappointment" and "dissatisfaction" with the results of the eighteen-nation London conference has not been eliminated. U.S. Ambassador to France, Dillon, visited French Prime Minister Mollet on the 24th. Parisian diplomatic observers pointed out that Dillon's visit was intended to "clarify the atmosphere" after Mollet expressed "dissatisfaction and concern" in a speech about the insufficient "unity" between France and its allies in the Suez Canal dispute.

    Commenting on Britain and France's actions to submit the Suez issue to the United Nations, the Parisian newspaper "Combat" pointed out that the "mediocre results" of the eighteen-nation London conference led Britain and France to unite and "adopt a certain degree of autonomy toward the United States." Reuters reported that after completing the procedures for submitting the issue to the Security Council, Britain and France will agree on a "common strategy" to be adopted in the Security Council. The news also said that it is rumored that Britain and France are prepared not necessarily to obtain the full consent of the U.S. government in future action plans.

    The French right-wing newspaper "Paris News" expressed great dissatisfaction on the 24th with the West's lack of coordination, writing: "If Washington, London, and Paris continue to act on the Suez issue as they have done so far, then the Atlantic Treaty will soon lose all meaning."

    英法美对处理苏伊士问题的步骤上有分歧
    新华社25日讯　西方通讯社和报纸继续报道英法美三国在对付苏伊士问题的步骤上的分歧。
    美国国务院官员24日说，美国仍在等待英国“澄清”英法把苏伊士运河问题提交联合国的意图。国际新闻社消息说，华盛顿专家们对于英国强调要安全理事会同意十八国的“国际管制”运河计划一节也感到“迷惑不解”。
    据报道，法国政府对十八国伦敦会议的结果的“失望”和“不满”一直没有消除。美国驻法国大使逖龙24日访问了法国总理摩勒。巴黎外交观察家指出，逖龙拜访的目的是为了摩勒在演说中谈到对法国和它的盟国之间在苏伊士运河争端上的“团结”不充分表示了“不满和担心”的话以后，来“澄清一下气氛”。
    巴黎“战斗报”在评论英法把苏伊士问题提交联合国的行动时指出，十八国伦敦会议的“平凡的结果”使英法联合起来“对美国采取了某种程度的自主态度”。路透社消息说，在完成把问题提交安全理事会的手续以后，英法将商定在安全理事会中采取“共同策略”。消息又说，据传闻，英法在未来的行动计划上准备不一定取得美国政府的完全同意。
    法国右翼“巴黎新闻”24日对西方步调的不一致非常不满，它写道：“如果华盛顿、伦敦和巴黎在苏伊士问题上继续像他们到目前为止这样行事，那么，大西洋公约就会很快失去一切意义”。
