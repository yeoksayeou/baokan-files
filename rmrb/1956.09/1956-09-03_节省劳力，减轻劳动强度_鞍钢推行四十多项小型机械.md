Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Anshan Iron and Steel Company (Angang) has promoted 49 small machines in the past eight months. This has not only saved 344 laborers but has also reduced the labor intensity of 466 workers.

In the past, the refractory materials factory required 42 workers daily to push ore carts along light-duty rails to transport dolomite. Now, a belt conveyor more than 100 meters long has been installed there, requiring only nine workers to operate it. Large iron ore rocks supporting Angang from all over the country used to require a large number of workers with hammers to break them before being sent to smelt pig iron. Since installing eight crushers in the Lingshan ore yard in August, not only has it saved 115 laborers, but it has also reduced the physical labor intensity of 150 people, and the work efficiency has also increased by 50%.

When the cast pipe factory was manufacturing ingot molds, due to the renovation of two cranes and the addition of sand mills and other equipment, 42 workers were saved, and the output doubled. This allows the state to create an additional 2 million yuan in value of ingot molds annually.

Most of these small machines, except for a few pieces of equipment that need to be ordered from domestic machinery factories, are made by Angang's maintenance workers using existing equipment and substandard and waste products.

    节省劳力，减轻劳动强度
    鞍钢推行四十多项小型机械
    据新华社讯　鞍钢在最近八个月中推行四十九项小型机械以后，不但节省了三百四十四个劳动力，并且还减轻了四百六十六个工人的劳动强度。
    耐火材料厂过去每天要四十二个工人，手推矿石车沿着轻便轨道运送白云石，现在那里已经安装好一条一百多公尺长的皮带运输机，只要九个工人操纵就行了。全国各地支援鞍钢的大块铁矿石，过去都需要组织大批工人拿着铁锤敲碎，然后再送去冶炼生铁。灵山矿石场从八月份安装上八台破碎机以后，现在不但能够节省一百一十五个劳动力，并且还减轻了一百五十个人的体力劳动强度，工作效率也提高了50％。
    铸管厂在制造钢锭模的时候，由于改建了两台吊车，增加了砂碾子等设备，也节省了四十二个工人，并且使产量提高了二倍，一年能为国家多创造价值二百万元的钢锭模。
    这些小型机械除了少数设备需要向国内机械厂订购外，大多数是鞍钢的检修工人利用现有设备和次品、废品制成的。
