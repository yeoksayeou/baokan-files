Reading Ancient Fables
		Zhang Youluan
    Our ancestors left us many valuable fables. Today, when we read these fables, we find they are simply clever satires of certain international political phenomena. Here are four examples to illustrate the rest.

    Dog's Fierceness Sours the Wine

    There was a family that sold wine. The wine was well-made, the servings were generous, and the guests were treated with respect. The sign was hung high so people could see it from afar. However, no one bought their wine; the good wine sat unsold for a long time and turned sour.

    The wine seller was puzzled and sought advice from a wise man.

    The wise man asked, "Do you have a fierce dog at home?"

    The wine seller said, "What does having a fierce dog have to do with whether or not the wine sells?"

    The wise man said, "You have a fierce dog. When people come to buy wine, it bites them. Who would come to buy your wine then?"

    So it is said: A fierce dog can sour the wine.

    ——From "Han Feizi"

    Reading this fable, I think of the United Nations. The United Nations should have been able to sell "good wine," but now the wine seems to have turned a bit sour.

    A Macaque Takes a Tiger's Brain

    There is a type of monkey called a macaque. Although small, its claws are very sharp.

    A tiger felt an itch on its head. The macaque said, "Let me scratch it for you."

    The macaque scratched the tiger's head, and the tiger felt very comfortable. As it scratched, it made a hole in the tiger's head and scooped out the tiger's brain. The macaque ate some and offered a handful to the tiger. The tiger praised the macaque, saying, "You are very good to me, very loyal."

    As more of the tiger's brain flowed out, it began to hurt. Then the tiger realized something was wrong and jumped up to hit the macaque, but the macaque climbed up a tree.

    The unfortunate tiger eventually died. The macaque came down from the tree and slowly ate its flesh and blood.

    ——From "Xian Yi" Admonitory Chapter

    Reading this fable, I think of American "aid" to other countries. Shouldn't those who have not awakened and are being "aided" be vigilant?

    Ghosts Fear the Ruthless

    There was a small ditch in front of a temple. After heavy rain, the water rose, and someone passing by could not cross it. So, they used the statue of the ghost king enshrined in the temple as a plank to cross the ditch.

    Later, another person came along and, seeing that the ghost king had been desecrated, felt uneasy. They respectfully picked up the statue, wiped it clean with their own clothes, and placed it back inside the shrine.

    That night, the little ghosts in the temple said to the ghost king, "Your Majesty is a local deity. Now that you have been insulted like this, you must use some divine power to retaliate." The ghost king said, "That's right. I will inflict some misfortune on the later person."

    The little ghosts did not understand and asked, "The previous person was disrespectful to Your Majesty. You did not punish them. How can you inflict misfortune on the later, respectful person?"

    The ghost king said, "The previous person doesn't believe in ghosts. How would I dare to provoke them!"

    ——From "Aizi's Miscellaneous Sayings"

    Reading this fable, I think of Egypt's righteous act of taking back the Suez Canal Company. Only by not fearing ghosts can we prevent ghosts from making trouble.

    Ginger Growing on Trees

    There was a person who did not know what ginger was and said that ginger grew on trees.

    Someone told him, "Ginger is planted in the ground, not grown on trees."

    The person did not believe it, and they argued with each other.

    The person said, "I am willing to bet my donkey that I am riding that ginger grows on trees."

    After asking ten people, all ten people said that ginger is planted in the ground.

    The person lost their donkey.

    While handing the donkey over to someone else, they still said, "Although I lost the donkey to you, ginger should still grow on trees."

    ——From "Xuetao's Novel"

    Reading this fable, I think of the ugly behavior of the British, French, and American governments on the Suez Canal issue. The person riding the donkey was at least honest; what they "lost" was, after all, their own donkey. However, the governments of Britain, France, and other countries insisted on seizing other people's "donkeys" as their own, and after "losing" their plundered goods, they still tried every possible way to grab them back!

    读古代寓言
    张友鸾
    我们的祖先给我们留下了许多宝贵的寓言。我们今天读这些寓言，觉得它们简直是对某些国际政治现象的巧妙的讽喻。这里试举四则，以例其余。
    狗猛酒酸
    有个卖酒的人家，酒做得好，给的分量足，招待客人也很恭敬，招牌挂得高高地使人一望而知。但是，没有人买它的酒；酒好久卖不出，变酸了。
    这个卖酒的人心里奇怪，就去向一个聪明人求教。
    聪明人问：“你家里是不是有一条恶狗？”
    卖酒的人说：“狗恶不恶，和酒卖不卖得掉，有什么关系呢？”
    聪明人说：“你养了一条恶狗，遇到买酒的人来就要咬，谁还来买你的酒呢？”
    所以说：狗恶会使酒发酸。
    ——出“韩非子”
    读了这个寓言，我想起联合国。联合国本来应该而且可以出卖“好酒”的，可是这酒现在好像有点变酸了。
    猱取虎脑
    有一种猴子名叫猱，身体虽小，爪子却很锋利。
    老虎觉得脑袋发痒，猱说：“我来给你抓抓痒。”
    猱抓着老虎脑袋，老虎觉得很舒服。抓着抓着，就在老虎脑袋上抓了一个洞，掏出了老虎的脑髓，猱一面自己吃，一面抓一把请老虎。老虎这时还称赞着猱说：“你对我真不错，够忠心的。”
    老虎的脑髓流多了，疼痛起来，这时知道情形不对，跳起来要打猱，猱却爬上树去了。
    这只倒霉的老虎，终于死去。猱再从树上下来，慢慢吃它的血肉。
    ——出“贤奕”警喻篇
    读了这个寓言，我想起美国对其他国家的“援助”。那些没有醒悟过来的被“援助”者，难道还不应该警惕吗？
    鬼怕狠人
    庙前有一条小沟。天雨水涨，有人从这里经过，跨不过去，就把庙里供的鬼王神像当做跳板，搭在沟上，走过去了。
    随后又有一人走来，看见鬼王被亵渎了，心下不安，恭恭敬敬把神像捧起，用自己衣服揩抹干净，重行安放神龛之内。
    晚上，庙里小鬼就向鬼王说：“大王是一方之神，如今这样被人侮辱，必须施些神力，报复一下才是。”鬼王说：“这话不错，我要在后来的那个人身上降给一些灾殃。”
    小鬼不明白，问：“先前那个人，对大王不敬，大王不去治他，怎么倒对后来的那个恭敬的人降给灾殃呢？”
  鬼王说：“先前那个人既不信鬼，我怎么敢去惹他哩！”
              ——出“艾子杂说”
  读了这个寓言，我想起埃及收回苏彝士运河公司的正义举动。只有不怕鬼，才能使鬼不敢作祸。
    树上生姜
    有个不认识生姜的人，说生姜是在树上结成的。
    别人告诉他说：“生姜是种在土里，不是结在树上的。”
    那人不信，彼此争执起来。
    那人说：“我愿用我所骑的这一只驴和你打赌，保证生姜结在树上。”
    及至问过了十个人，十个人都说：生姜是种在土里的。
    那人输了他的驴。
    他一面把驴子让给别人，一面嘴里却还只是说：“驴子虽然输给你，生姜总还应该是树上结的。”
            ——出“雪涛小说”
    读了这个寓言，我想起英、法、美诸国政府在苏彝士运河问题上所表现的丑态。那个骑驴子的人毕竟是老实人，他“输”掉的毕竟是自己的驴子。而英、法等国政府却硬要把别人的“驴子”攫为己有，在“输”掉掠夺物之后还要千方百计地想把它抢回去！
