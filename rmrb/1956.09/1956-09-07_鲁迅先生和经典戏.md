Mr. Lu Xun and Classical Opera
Xu Gan

(III)

The local opera that Mr. Lu Xun watched, which I called "Wen Luan Tan" or "Shaoxing Opera" above, is not the current "Yue Opera." Later, when it came to Shanghai from Shaoxing, it was renamed "Shaoxing Da Ban" precisely to distinguish it from the Yue Opera from Shengxian, originally called "Didu Ban." A couple of years ago, probably because the word "Da" (big) in "Da Ban" seemed a bit presumptuous, it was renamed "Shao Opera."

Articles discussing this opera genre, found in publications, seem to be limited to one in the "Introduction to Local Operas of East China" collection, which mainly introduces its tunes. It is said that it now only has three troupes left, regularly performing in Shanghai and Hangzhou, and only returning to Shaoxing for a few days around the Spring Festival during the agricultural slack season, which has become a rare rural tour performance.

They have a play called "The Reed Flower Record," which won an award at the East China Regional Opera Performance and Observation Conference two years ago and became somewhat known.

In fact, the history of this opera genre is only shorter than the now-extinct Gaoqiang (High Voice), and much longer than Yue Opera. It has hundreds of traditional plays, and dozens of complete operas, with many excellent heritages (especially old plays adapted from stories of the Five Dynasties and the Sui and Tang Dynasties), which are worth exploring and sorting out.

Among the existing veteran artists, there are also many outstanding performers. Just speaking of the second clown mentioned above, there is Wang Xiaokui, whose stage name is Yutu (Jade Rabbit). For the past twenty years, he has been the leading figure as the second clown, with a wide range of roles and many signature plays. The most popular among the Yue people include the Qi King's "Crying in the Palace," Xue Gang's "Beating the Ancestral Temple," and group scenes where the second clown plays a significant role, such as "Dragon and Phoenix Lock," "Double Scissors Hair," "Tai Shi Tu," "Purple Jade Pot," "Jade Dragon Ball"… I wonder if comrades in the opera circles have seen the plays I have listed here in the repertoire of other opera genres?

What is particularly worth noting is that the vast majority of Shao Opera artists are not only from peasant backgrounds, but also have undergone rigorous training in opera schools. After becoming famous, they often still perform opera during the agricultural slack season and return to the fields during the busy farming season. Before liberation, when the city was in recession, they couldn't stay outside and returned to their hometowns. However, the countryside was also in recession, and there were very few opportunities to perform opera. Some had no land to cultivate and had to resort to selling scallions and vegetables. They are true folk artists, and their simple lives and difficult experiences are just like those of Kunqu Opera artists.

In order to commemorate the anniversary of Mr. Lu Xun's death, thinking of the Shaoxing Opera that Mr. Lu Xun loved very much in his youth and later drew a lot of material from, I couldn't help but think further and further. I feel that this opera genre is also a flower that can be fully bloomed, and I am worried that it will decline before it gets old. In order to prevent it from disappearing like "Gaoqiang" and to make it possible to blossom like the "Fifteen Strings of Cash" of the Jiangsu Kunqu Opera Troupe, the current general support may not be enough.

Therefore, I even think like this: in the commemorative programs around the anniversary of Mr. Lu Xun's death, in addition to the film "The New Year's Sacrifice," the Yue Opera and Ping Opera "Sister Xianglin," and the drama "The True Story of Ah Q," it would be best to have such a group of programs from the Shao Opera Troupe:

	1. "Dragon and Tiger Fight,"
	2. "Garden Tour and Hanging Beating,"
	3. "Male and Female Hanging Dance,"
	4. "Dancing Wu Chang."

Although this is a topic that is far from the main point, I am willing to seriously propose it as a suggestion. The purpose is to entertain Mr. Lu Xun in the afterlife and to draw everyone's attention to this opera genre.

    鲁迅先生和经典戏
    徐淦
    （三）
    鲁迅先生所看的乡戏，我在上面叫它“文乱弹”或“绍兴戏”，它不是现在的“越剧”。它后来从绍兴到了上海，正为了与来自嵊县原叫“的笃班”的越剧区别，才改称“绍兴大班”。前两年，大概鉴于大班的大字显得有点自大，又正名为“绍剧”了。
    谈论这个剧种的文章，见之于书刊的，至今似乎只有“华东地方戏曲介绍”集中的一篇，还主要在介绍它的曲调。据说它现在只胜三个剧团，经常在上海、杭州两处演出，仅仅在春节前后农闲时回到绍兴去几天，那倒反成为难得的下乡巡回演出了。
    他们有一折“芦花记”，前年在华东区戏曲观摩演出大会中得了奖，稍稍为人所知。
    其实，这个剧种的历史，仅逊于现已绝响的高腔，远比越剧悠久。它有几百个传统剧目，统本戏也有几十部，不少优秀遗产（特多搬演五代隋唐故事的老戏），值得发掘整理。
    现有老艺人当中，也有许多出色的表演家，单讲上面所说的二丑，就有汪筱奎其人，艺名玉兔，二十年来一直以二丑挑大梁，戏路宽，拿手好戏多得很，最脍炙越人之口的如齐王“哭殿”，薛刚“打太庙”和二丑在戏里很吃重的群戏“龙凤锁”，“双剪发”，“太狮图”，“紫玉壶”，“玉龙球”……这里所举的剧目，不知戏曲界的同志曾在别的剧种的剧目中见过否？
    尤其值得重视的是，绍剧艺人极大多数不但是农民出身，而且经过科班的苦学苦练，成名之后，往往仍然是农闲时唱戏，农忙时归田。解放前，遇着城市不景气，他们在外边待不住，回到家乡，农村也不景气，极少唱戏机会，有的又无田可种，竟不得不挑葱卖菜。他们是真正的民间艺人，朴质的生活和困苦的遭遇，也正如昆剧艺人一样。
    我为了记念鲁迅先生的忌日，想到先生少时十分喜爱，后来从中吸取了不少素材的绍兴戏，不禁想了开去，越想越远，觉得这个剧种，也是一棵大可开放的花，耽心它未老先衰；要使它不像“高腔”那样消亡，要使它有可能开出像苏昆剧团的“十五贯”那样的花来，现有的一般的支持恐怕还是不够的。
    因此，我甚至这样想：在鲁迅先生忌日前后的纪念节目中，希望除了有电影“祝福”，有越剧和评剧“祥林嫂”，有话剧“阿Q正传”之外，最好还有绍剧团的这样一组节目：
    一、“龙虎斗”，
    二、“游园吊打”，
    三、“男女跳吊”，
    四、“跳无常”。
    这虽然是离题十万八千里的话，我却愿意认真当建议提出。其目的，一是娱鲁迅先生于地下，二是引起大家对这个剧种的注意。
                          （完）
