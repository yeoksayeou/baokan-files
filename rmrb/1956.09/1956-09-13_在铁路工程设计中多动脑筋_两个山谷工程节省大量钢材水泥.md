Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, September 11th: Technical personnel from the First Design Institute of the Ministry of Railways saved the state 354 tons of steel and more than 1,900 tons of cement in the design of two valley projects north of Dijiatai on the Baolan Railway.

The Baolan Railway had to pass through two very deep valleys in the high-level seismic zone north of Dijiatai. Because building very high roadbeds in seismic zones could not guarantee project safety, the original plan was to build two large iron bridges here, requiring ten-span steel beams with a total weight of more than 300 tons and a large amount of cement. When the technical personnel of the First Design Institute were carrying out the design, they came up with the idea of first building wide platforms more than ten meters high in each of the two valleys using sand and gravel, and then building low roadbeds on the solid platforms to replace the two large iron bridges that were to be built. In this way, the height of the roadbed was reduced to about half the depth of the valley. In addition, a small culvert was built under each of the two sections of valley roadbed to allow rainwater flowing from the valley to pass through during rain. After studying this method, Soviet experts believed that it was scientifically sound, could ensure safety in the seismic zone, and also saved the country a lot of steel and cement.

The design of these two valley projects has now been completed and will soon be under construction.

    在铁路工程设计中多动脑筋
    两个山谷工程节省大量钢材水泥
    新华社兰州11日电　铁道部第一设计院的技术人员在设计包兰铁路狄家台以北两个山谷工程中，为国家节省了三百五十四吨钢材和一千九百多吨水泥。
    包兰铁路要穿过狄家台以北高级地震区两个很深的山谷，因为在地震区修筑很高的路基不能保证工程安全，所以原来确定的计划要在这里修筑两座大铁桥，需要总重三百多吨的十孔钢梁和大量的水泥。第一设计院技术人员在进行设计的时候，想出用砂石先在两个山谷里各修起十多公尺高的宽大平台，再在结实的平台上建筑不高的路基代替要建筑的两座大铁桥。这样，路基的高度就减少到山谷深度的一半左右，两段山谷路基的底下另外各修一个小涵洞，让下雨的时候从山谷流出的雨水通过。苏联专家研究了这个方法以后，认为这样做完全有科学根据，能够保证地震区的安全，同时也为国家节省了大量钢材和水泥。
    现在这两个山谷工程已经全部设计好，很快就要施工。
