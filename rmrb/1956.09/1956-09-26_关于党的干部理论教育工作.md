Comrade Xu Liqun, Director of the Theoretical Propaganda Department of the Central Propaganda Department of the Communist Party of China, spoke:

Improvements should be sought in the following areas: strengthen the teaching staff and improve teaching quality; strengthen the connection between theory and practice; implement the Central Committee's instructions on the rotational training of party member cadres at or above the intermediate level; the content of study should not be forcibly unified, and the methods should be diverse; the theoretical study of non-Party cadres must be based on their complete voluntariness.

I completely agree with the reports of Comrades Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, and Deng Xiaoping. Comrade Liu Shaoqi, in his political report, clearly stated the importance of strengthening the Marxist-Leninist theoretical study of Party cadres. Now I would like to express some personal opinions on several issues in the cadre theoretical education work.

The Party's cadre theoretical education work has played a significant role since the founding of the People's Republic of China. Since the year before last, the Party has strengthened the work of Party schools and implemented a system of rotational training for senior and intermediate cadres, and for senior cadres who cannot be transferred to Party schools for study, they are allowed to study on their own without leaving their posts. Localities have equipped on-the-job cadres with about 4,500 full-time teachers of theoretical courses. These efforts have achieved good results.

Here, I will not talk about the achievements, but only about the areas that should be improved at present.

At present, many aspects of cadre theoretical education work cannot meet the needs of the development of the situation. First of all, cadres and intellectuals now have a high enthusiasm for studying Marxist-Leninist theory, and they require help and guidance. However, our guidance force is very weak and the teaching quality is very low, which cannot meet everyone's needs. Moreover, some teachers have the dogmatic habit of reading from the book and reciting articles.

Secondly, in the organizational work of cadre theoretical education, there are shortcomings of managing too much and too rigidly. Some comrades have seen the importance of cadres learning Marxist-Leninist theory, but have not fully considered their needs in other aspects, and want to organize all on-the-job cadres with junior middle school graduation or even less than junior middle school graduation to participate in theoretical study, and want to use spare-time political schools as the main form to absorb everyone. In fact, this "package" approach is no longer suitable for the current situation. Because, with the advancement of socialist construction, many cadres urgently need to learn business management knowledge and technical knowledge, and some also need to improve their cultural and scientific level. Moreover, the political level and theoretical knowledge level of most cadres have improved in recent years. In this case, whether systematic theoretical study should be carried out first, or business and technical knowledge should be learned first, should be arranged according to actual needs and personal voluntariness. In addition, although learning Marxism-Leninism is necessary for every cadre, the method of learning does not have to be immutable, let alone forced to be consistent. At present, there is a problem of forcibly seeking uniformity in these aspects in the theoretical education work in many places. Some places assign senior intellectuals and university graduate cadres to junior groups to study, and some places force many old and weak cadres to participate in the study, and do not give necessary and appropriate care to women cadres with many children and heavy housework. These are all inappropriate.

Finally, there are too many types of learning for cadres at present. In addition to theoretical, cultural, technical, and business learning, many leading organs often assign various short-term and long-term learning tasks to the lower levels, and often do not distinguish between different situations and organize all cadres to participate in the learning. This has created a chaotic phenomenon in which various studies conflict with each other, making it impossible for many cadres to rest in their spare time and even affecting their health. Naturally, this problem is no longer just a problem in the theoretical education field, but needs to be solved jointly by all parties.

Based on the above situation, the following measures are recommended:

It is necessary to continue to strengthen the team of theoretical education work and strive to improve teaching quality. The political level and theoretical knowledge level of the majority of cadres are higher than a few years ago, but the guiding force of theoretical education has grown very slowly. This is a basic contradiction in the current theoretical education work. At present, there is already a group of full-time teachers and part-time teachers across the country. This is an important force, but many of them still need to continue to improve their theoretical knowledge and cultural and scientific level in order to well bear their work. At present, it is necessary to continue to transfer cadres with promising prospects to serve as teachers of theoretical courses, and take effective measures to cultivate and improve them. For the existing teachers of theoretical courses, in addition to planned transfers to Party schools for further study, it is also necessary to hold more teaching seminars, various theoretical problem seminars, and holiday seminars and research conferences, and organize them to formulate self-study plans in order to help them teach and improve at the same time. At present, teachers of theoretical courses need to be encouraged, supervised, and helped more. In addition, there are still erroneous ideas within the Party that underestimate the teachers of theoretical courses, which should also be corrected. In some provinces, full-time teachers have not yet been included in the formal establishment. This issue needs to be resolved quickly. It is recommended that teachers of theoretical courses be included in the formal establishment, and the funding be paid from Party dues.

Strengthening the connection between theory and practice is a policy that should be constantly adhered to in theoretical education. In order to effectively oppose dogmatism in teaching work and promote the use of Marxist principles to analyze Chinese revolution problems and other various problems in actual life, in addition to criticizing various manifestations of dogmatism, it is more important to take many concrete steps from the positive side. At present, there is an urgent need to compile textbooks for middle and junior groups that combine the actual situation of China and the experience of the Chinese revolution, and also provide teaching staff with various practical materials to help them understand the Party's policies and the actual situation of implementation, strengthen the study of Comrade Mao Zedong's works, and strengthen theoretical research work in order to gradually strengthen the connection between the teaching of theoretical courses and practice. In teaching, it is also necessary to continue to promote the experience of rectification, that is, to use the theoretical knowledge learned as a weapon to specifically analyze the main problems in one's work and thinking. Of course, promoting the use of the Marxist stand, viewpoint, and method to analyze practical problems must also prevent the tendency of vulgarization and simplification of indiscriminately applying formulas and indiscriminately labeling. We must promote independent thinking more. Comrade Mao Zedong said, "To remove the strong blindness in our Party, we must promote thinking, learn the method of analyzing things, and cultivate the habit of analysis." This call is still very meaningful for our theoretical education work.

For the organizational work of theoretical education for the vast number of on-the-job cadres, there are three points: First, it is to implement the Central Committee's instructions on the rotational training of Party member cadres at or above the intermediate level. Comrade Liu Shaoqi pointed out in his political report, "We must earnestly strengthen the systematic Marxist-Leninist study of cadres, especially senior cadres." Comrade Deng Xiaoping said in his report: "According to rough statistics, there are more than 300,000 cadres in the whole Party who are equivalent to or above the level of county party committee members. The quality of the work of these more than 300,000 people has a decisive influence on the cause of the Party." We must first do a good job in the theoretical education of this group of comrades, especially senior cadres. Transferring senior cadres to study off the job will certainly affect some work, but learning theory well can improve foresight in leadership work and help them summarize work experience. This loss caused by off-the-job study can be compensated. At present, senior cadres are required to first learn philosophy and political economy, because learning philosophy can help overcome subjectivism in work and improve work style, and learning political economy can help the current research on socialist transformation and socialist construction, and can greatly reduce blindness in policy implementation. In order to achieve the task of rotational training, provinces that have not yet established intermediate Party schools should try their best to run intermediate Party schools, and primary Party schools should also be improved and strengthened. Second, the theoretical study of the vast number of on-the-job cadres should not be forcibly unified in content, and the methods should be diverse in order to suit different situations and be carried out flexibly. The Party's propaganda departments should run spare-time political schools (or night schools) with a relatively high degree of regularization, and cadres should voluntarily sign up to participate. The spare-time political schools that have already been held in various places need to be gradually improved. Spare-time political schools are certainly an effective form of organizing theoretical study for on-the-job cadres, but they cannot be regarded as the only form. In fact, in addition to entering Party schools, cadre schools, and spare-time political schools, many cadres will be willing to study theory in other ways. Some people are willing to study on their own, some are willing to organize reading clubs and research associations, some are willing to study faster and read more reference books, and some are willing to study slower and read fewer reference books. All of these can be left to their own free will, without too much intervention and restriction. The Party's propaganda departments should adopt various methods to organize reports and speeches on relevant theoretical issues, or answer difficult questions in theoretical study, inspire everyone's independent thinking, and actively help everyone learn better. These reports and speeches should be of a considerable level so that they can attract cadres to voluntarily listen. In short, organizing the vast number of cadres to study Marxism is a lively and vigorous political work, and should never be simply carried out by relying on rigid administrative orders. If we think that since Marxism has been generally recognized as the guiding ideology of the whole country, we can use administrative power to instill it into cadres and the masses as a dogma, this idea is completely wrong. Third, the theoretical study of non-Party cadres must be based on their complete voluntariness. Our Party has the responsibility to encourage and help them study theory, but there should never be any wrong behavior of forcing them to study. Some people worry that emphasizing the principle of voluntariness will have an adverse impact on expanding the Marxist position. In fact, the enthusiasm of the vast number of non-Party cadres for studying Marxist-Leninist theory is also very high today, so this worry is completely unnecessary. Marxism-Leninism is the truth, and the power of truth cannot be resisted. If it can still gain more and more support from the masses under the cruel oppression of Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary rule until it achieves the victory of the Chinese revolution, then how can there be any danger of shrinking the position now that Marxism has gained unprecedented prestige? Some of our comrades are wholeheartedly trying to expand the influence of Marxism, but some methods are not right, which has reduced some people's interest in learning Marxism. This situation should be paid attention to and changed.

Finally, it is recommended to comprehensively arrange various studies for cadres and overcome the phenomenon of too many types of learning and too heavy a burden. In principle, it is stipulated that each cadre can only have one main study project in a certain period. It is recommended that the central and local departments in charge of cadre management make comprehensive plans based on the specific situation in order to thoroughly solve the chaotic phenomenon in study.

Please correct any incorrect opinions above.

    关于党的干部理论教育工作
    中共中央宣传部理论宣传处处长　许立群同志的发言
    应该在这些方面求得改进：加强教学队伍，提高教学质量；加强理论和实际的联系；贯彻执行中央关于轮训中级以上党员干部的指示；学习内容不要强求统一，方式应该多种多样；党外干部的理论学习，必须根据本人的完全自愿。
    我完全同意刘少奇，周恩来，邓小平同志的报告。刘少奇同志在政治报告里，对于加强党的干部马克思列宁主义理论学习的重要性，已经说得很清楚了。现在我想对干部理论教育工作中的几个问题发表一些个人的意见。
    党的干部理论教育工作，在中华人民共和国成立以来，起了显著的作用。党从前年起加强了党校工作，实行了轮训高级和中级干部的制度，对于不能调进党校学习的高级干部，则让他们离职自修。各地为在职干部配备了四千五百名左右的专职理论课的教员。这些工作都取得了良好的效果。
    这里，我不去说成绩的方面，单说目前应该改进的地方。
    目前干部理论教育工作，许多方面不能适应形势发展的需要。首先，现在干部和知识分子学习马克思列宁主义理论的热情是很高的，他们要求帮助和指导，但是，我们的指导力量很薄弱，教学质量很低，不能满足大家的需要。而且，有一些教员有照本宣科、背诵条文的教条主义习气。
    其次，干部理论教育的组织工作上，有管得过多过死的缺点。有些同志看到了干部学习马克思列宁主义理论的重要性，但是没有全面考虑他们在其它方面的需要，就想把具有初中毕业程度的在职干部、甚至还不到初中毕业程度的干部，全部都组织起来参加理论学习，并且想用业余政治学校作为主要形式，把大家都吸收进去。实际上，这种“包下来”的办法对于目前的情况已经不适合了。因为，随着社会主义建设的前进，许多干部迫切需要学习业务的管理知识和技术知识，有的还需要提高文化、科学水平，而且，多数干部的政治水平和理论知识水平几年来已经有了提高，在这种情况下，究竟应该先进行系统的理论学习，或者先学习业务、技术知识，是应该根据实际需要和本人自愿来安排的。此外，学习马克思列宁主义，对于每一个干部虽然都是必须的，但是，学习的方法却不必一成不变，更不应该勉强求得一致。现在许多地方的理论教育工作中在这些方面有一种强求一律的毛病。有些地方把高级知识分子和大学毕业的干部编到初级组学习，有的地方还勉强许多年老体弱的干部一律参加学习，对于子女很多、家务很重的妇女干部也不加以必要的和适当的照顾，这些都是不合适的。
    最后，目前干部学习的种类太多，除了理论、文化、技术、业务等学习以外，许多领导机关常常向下布置各种各样的、短期的和长期的学习任务，而且往往不区别不同情况，把全体干部都组织进来学习。这样就造成了各种学习彼此冲突的混乱现象，使得许多干部在业余时间不能休息，甚至影响到他们的健康。自然，这个问题已经不只是理论教育方面的问题，而是需要各方面共同来解决的。
    根据以上情况，建议采取以下措施：
    要继续加强理论教育工作的队伍，努力提高教学质量。现在广大干部政治水平和理论知识的水平比几年以前已经有了提高，可是，理论教育的指导力量却生长得很慢，这是当前理论教育工作中的一项基本矛盾。目前全国已有了一批专职教员和兼职教员，这是一支重要的力量，但是他们当中有许多人还需要继续提高自己的理论知识和文化科学水平，才能很好地负担起自己的工作。目前有必要继续抽调有培养前途的干部担任论理课程的教员，并且采取有效的办法加以培养和提高。对于现有的理论课程的教员，除了有计划地抽调入党校进修以外，还要多办教学座谈会，各种理论问题座谈会和假期讲习会、研究会，组织他们制定自修计划，以便帮助他们一面教学，一面提高。目前理论课程的教员需要多加以鼓励、督促和帮助。此外，党内还有人有轻视理论课程的教员的错误思想，这也应该纠正。有的省份的专职教员，至今还是没有被列入正式编制，这个问题需要迅速加以解决，建议把理论课程的教员列入正式编制，经费由党费内开支。
    加强理论和实际的联系，这是理论教育中应该经常注意贯彻的方针。为了有效的反对教学工作中的教条主义，提倡用马克思主义原理来分析中国革命问题和实际生活中的其它各种问题，除了必须批判教条主义的各种表现，更重要的就是要从积极方面采取许多具体的步骤。现在急需结合中国的实际情况和中国革命经验编写中初级组的教材，还要多供给教学人员以各种实际资料，帮助他们了解党的政策和执行的实际情况，加强对于毛泽东同志著作的学习，加强理论研究工作，以便逐步加强理论课程的教学和实际的联系。在教学当中还要继续提倡整风的经验，即用学得的理论知识作武器，具体地分析自己的工作和思想中的主要的问题。当然，提倡用马克思主义的立场、观点、方法来分析实际问题，必须同时防止乱套公式、乱贴标签的庸俗化、简单化的倾向。我们要多提倡独立思考，毛泽东同志说过，“要去掉我们党内浓厚的盲目性，必须提倡思索，学会分析事物的方法，养成分析的习惯”。这个号召，对于我们的理论教育工作仍然是很有意义的。
    对于广大在职干部的理论教育组织工作，有三点意见：第一，是贯彻执行中央关于轮训中级以上党员干部的指示。刘少奇同志在政治报告中指出，“我们必须认真地加强干部的首先是高级干部的系统的马克思列宁主义的学习。”邓小平同志的报告中说：“根据粗略的统计，全党有相当于县委委员一级以上的干部三十多万人，这三十多万人的工作的好坏，对于党的事业有决定的影响。”我们首先要把对这部分同志，特别是对高级干部的理论教育工作做好。抽调高级干部离职学习固然要影响一些工作，但是，学好理论可以提高领导工作中的远见，帮助他们总结工作经验，这种由于离职学习而引起的损失是可以得到补偿的。目前要求高级干部首先学好哲学和政治经济学两门课程，因为学习哲学可以帮助克服工作中的主观主义，改进工作作风，学习政治经济学可以帮助对当前社会主义改造和社会主义建设的研究，可以大大减少执行政策当中的盲目性。为了实现轮训的任务，现在还没有设立中级党校的各省，应该尽可能争取开办中级党校，对于初级党校也应该提高加强。第二，广大的在职干部理论学习，内容不要强求统一，方式应该多种多样，以便适合不同的情况，灵活地进行。党的宣传工作部门要开办正规化程度比较高的业余政治学校（或夜校），由干部自愿报名参加。现在各地已经举办的业余政治学校需要逐步提高。业余政治学校固然是组织在职干部理论学习的一种有效的形式，但是，不能把它当做唯一的形式。事实上除了进党校、干部学校和业余政治学校以外，还会有许多干部愿意用其他方式学习理论，有的人愿意自修，有的人愿意组织读书会和研究会，有的人愿意学得快些，多读些参考书，有的人愿意学得慢些，少读些参考书，这都可以听其自愿，不要过多地干涉和限制。党的宣传部门应该采用各种办法，组织有关理论问题的报告、讲演，或者解答理论学习中的疑难问题，启发大家的独立思考，积极地帮助大家学得更好。这些报告和讲演，要有相当的水平，使它能吸引干部自愿听讲。总之，组织广大干部学习马克思主义是一项生动活泼的政治工作，绝不应该简单地依靠生硬的行政命令来进行。如果以为马克思主义既然已经被公认为全国的指导思想，因而我们就可以用行政力量把它当作教条灌输给干部和群众了，这种想法，是完全不对的。第三，对于党外干部的理论学习，必须根据本人的完全的自愿。我们党有责任鼓励和帮助他们学习理论，但是，绝不应该有任何勉强他们学习的错误行为。有人顾虑强调自愿原则就会对于扩大马克思主义的阵地产生不利的影响。其实，今天广大党外干部学习马克思列宁主义理论的热情也是很高的，因而这种顾虑是完全不必要的。马克思列宁主义是真理，而真理的力量是不可能抗拒的，如果说，它在蒋介石反动统治的残酷的压迫下面还能取得愈来愈多的群众的拥护，直到取得中国革命的胜利，那么，在马克思主义获得空前巨大威信的现在，怎么会有什么缩小阵地的危险呢？我们有些同志一心想扩大马克思主义的影响，但是，有些方法不对头，反而使得有些人对于马克思主义的学习减少了兴趣。这种情况是应该加以注意改变的。
    最后，建议全面安排干部的各种学习，克服学习种类过多，负担过重的现象。原则上规定每个干部的主要学习项目，在一个时期内只能有一种。建议中央和地方的各管理干部的部门，根据具体情况作出全面的规划，以便彻底解决学习上的混乱现象。
    以上意见有不对的地方，请同志们指正。
