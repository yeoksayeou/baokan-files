Xinhua News Agency, September 10th – Following Egypt's decisive rejection of the Dulles Plan, London has once again become the center for the West to plot further diplomatic measures. On September 9th, Eden returned to London after meeting with the Queen in Scotland, awaiting talks with the French Prime Minister. The members of the "Five-Nation Committee," with the exception of the Foreign Ministers of Ethiopia and Iran who returned to their respective countries, will also travel to London on the 10th.

According to the United Press, citing British officials, Eden remains adamant that the Suez Canal should be internationalized. They also said that Britain and France are prepared to use force if canal traffic is obstructed or their nationals in Egypt are "endangered." However, these sources also said that Eden still wants to exhaust all possible avenues of arbitration first.

Reports say that Britain had requested Dulles to come to London to participate in the meeting between the British and French leaders. However, a U.S. State Department spokesman said on September 9th that Dulles intended to stay in Washington for the time being but would maintain close contact with London. According to the United Press, most U.S. State Department officials now seem to believe that it is impossible to adopt a "policy of strength" against Egypt, and the only way is to appeal to the United Nations to try to save face for the West.

    杜勒斯计划碰壁后
    西方加紧策划新步骤
    新华社10日讯　在埃及断然拒绝杜勒斯计划以后，伦敦已经再一次成为西方策划采取进一步的外交措施的中心。9月9日，艾登在苏格兰同女王会面以后回到伦敦，等待和法国总理举行会谈。“五国委员会”成员中除埃塞俄比亚和伊朗的外交大臣各自返国外，其余三个人也要在十日前往伦敦。
    据合众社引英国官方人士说，艾登仍然坚决认为苏彝士运河应该国际化。他们并且说，英法都准备使用武力，如果运河交通受到阻碍或它们在埃及的侨民受到“危害”的话。但是，这些人士又说，艾登还是要首先利用一切可能的仲裁途径。
    有消息说，英国曾经要求杜勒斯也来伦敦参加英法两国首脑的会谈。但是美国国务院发言人9月9日说，杜勒斯的意思是暂时留在华盛顿，不过将同伦敦保持密切的接触。据合众社报道，美国国务院大多数官方人士现在似乎认为不可能对埃及采取“实力政策”，而唯一的办法是求助于联合国，设法保持西方的面子。
