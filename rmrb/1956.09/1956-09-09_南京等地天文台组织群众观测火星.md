Xinhua News Agency report: On the 7th, Mars was at its closest point to Earth. Observatories and planetariums in Nanjing, Shanghai, and Beijing organized observations.

Scientists at the Zijinshan Observatory used a 60 cm reflecting telescope and a 20 cm refracting telescope to photograph and visually observe Mars on the evening of the 7th in Nanjing. They observed that Mars was much brighter and larger than usual through the astronomical telescopes. Mars presented a clear circular surface, and the dark areas in the middle were also visible. They also took pictures of Mars at its closest approach to Earth. When Mars had just risen from the horizon, the Sheshan Observatory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Shanghai used a telescope with a focal length of 7 meters to aim at it. Several dark stripes were seen near the equator of Mars. The observatory's scientific researchers immediately recorded it with a camera. The observatory is now equipped with a set of physical instruments for observing Mars, equipped to observe its spectrum and azimuth around the Mars opposition, and to depict its color and shape.

Observatories and planetariums in Beijing, Shanghai, and Nanjing all guided the public in observations. Observatory scientists introduced various aspects of Mars to visitors and led them to observe Mars through astronomical telescopes. More than 10,000 people in Beijing registered to view Mars, and the Beijing Planetarium will organize them to observe in batches from now until the end of September.

    南京等地天文台组织群众观测火星
    新华社讯　7日是火星离地球最近的一天，南京、上海和北京的天文台和天文馆都组织了观测。
    紫金山天文台的科学工作者，7日晚在南京用口径六十公分的反光望远镜和二十公分的折光望远镜，对火星分别进行了照相和目视观测。他们从天文望远镜里观察到的火星，比平时亮得多，大得多。火星呈现清晰的圆面，中间暗淡的区域也可以看到。并且在这次火星最接近地球的时候拍下了照片。当火星刚从地平线升起，在上海的中国科学院佘山观象台就用焦距七公尺的望远镜瞄准了它，在火星赤道的附近，看到了几条暗色的条纹，观象台的科学研究人员立即用摄影机把它记录了下来。观象台现在已装备了一套观测火星的物理仪器，装备在火星大冲附近观测它的光谱和方位，并且描绘它的颜色和形态。
    北京、上海、南京的天文台和天文馆都指导群众观测。天文台科学工作者向参观者介绍了火星的各种情况，带领他们从天文望远镜里观察了火星。北京有一万多人登记要求观看火星，北京天文馆将组织他们从现在起到9月底分批观察。
