    Hungary to Hold Agricultural Exhibition
    (Our dispatch) It is reported that the Third National Agricultural Exhibition of Hungary will be held in Budapest in the first half of September this year. The National Agricultural Exhibition held last year attracted more than one million visitors, which is more than one-tenth of the country's population. This year's exhibition will be larger in scale and richer in content. It is estimated that more than 600 agricultural production units (including state farms, agricultural production cooperatives, and individual farmers) will exhibit their best products.
    The All-Hungary Agricultural Exhibition will clearly demonstrate that the production achievements of state farms and agricultural production cooperatives generally exceed those of individual farmers. The income of cooperative members is higher than that of individual households. Agricultural production cooperatives in Hungary have recently experienced significant development. At present, there are 4,863 agricultural production cooperatives in Hungary, with 343,397 members. The land cultivated by these cooperatives reaches 2,247,647 holds (each hold equals 0.57 hectares). The entire socialist agriculture now cultivates 34.73% of the country's arable land.
    In addition to agricultural products, Hungary's metallurgical and mechanical industry sectors will also exhibit many excellent products at the exhibition, including power machines, tractors, combine harvesters, potato diggers, and corn threshers.
    The exhibition will introduce various advanced production methods of the participating agricultural producers in detail to the audience, and organize experience exchanges between various agricultural producers. Therefore, this exhibition can also be said to be a school for spreading advanced experience in agricultural production, which will play an important role in promoting the development of agricultural production in Hungary.

    匈牙利即将举行农业展览会
    本报讯　今年9月上半月，匈牙利全国第三次农业展览会将在布达佩斯举行。去年举行的全国农业展览会曾吸引了一百多万参观者，等于全国人口的十分之一以上。今年的展览会规模和它的内容将更加扩大，估计将有六百多个农业生产单位（包括国营农场、农业生产合作社和个体农民）将要展出他们最好的产品。
    在全匈农业展览会上将显著地表明：各国营农场和农业生产合作社的生产成绩一般都超过单干农民的成绩。合作社社员的收入都比单干户的收入多。匈牙利的农业生产合作社最近有了显著的发展。现在匈牙利全国已经有四千八百六十三个农业生产合作社，拥有三十四万三千三百九十七个社员。这些合作社耕种的土地达到二百二十四万七千六百四十七霍尔德（每霍尔德合0.57公顷）。整个社会主义农业现在耕种着全国34.73％的可耕地。
    除了农产品以外，匈牙利的冶金和机械工业部门也将在会上展出许多优良产品，包括动力机、拖拉机、联合收割机、马铃薯挖掘机、玉蜀黍脱粒机等。
    展览会将要把参加展出的农业生产者的各种先进生产方法在详细地介绍给观众，并在各个农业生产者之间组织经验交流。因此，这个展览会也可以说是一个传播农业生产的先进经验的学校，它在促进匈牙利农业生产的发展上将起重要的作用。
