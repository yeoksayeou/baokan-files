    Bringing Water to Karamay
    Another Water Pipeline Begins Surveying
    Xinhua News Agency, Karamay, September 9th: The Karamay oil region is currently surveying its second water pipeline. This water pipeline is planned to bring water from Lake Ailik through Bieshidowu and then to Karamay. It is 100 kilometers long and is currently the longest water pipeline in China's petroleum industry construction. Once this pipeline is completed, 20,000 cubic meters of water will flow to Karamay through the pipeline every day. Coupled with the water brought in by another water pipeline (Manas River - Karamay) that has already begun surveying, the public water usage, basic construction water usage, and the domestic water usage of tens of thousands of employees in the Karamay oil region will be basically guaranteed for a certain period of time.
    Currently, the staff from the Beijing Design Institute of the Ministry of Petroleum Industry, who are responsible for surveying this pipeline, have already begun field surveying activities. They plan to complete the detailed survey by the end of October and submit preliminary design data by the end of the year, in order to lay the pipeline next spring.
    Karamay is a place that is extremely short of water. According to hydrological and geological personnel investigations, there is very little potable groundwater nearby. Therefore, it is necessary to build water pipelines to divert water from the Manas River, Lake Ailik, and other places to supply it.

    把水引到克拉玛依去
    又一条输水管线开始测量
    新华社克拉玛依9日电　克拉玛依油区正在测量第二条输水管线。这条输水管线是准备把艾里克湖的水，经过别士道吾再引到克拉玛依的，长达一百公里，是我国目前石油工业建设中最长的一条输水管线。这条管线修成以后，每天将会有二万立方水通过输水管线流到克拉玛依，再加上早已开始测量另一条输水管线（玛纳斯河——克拉玛依）引来的水，克拉玛依油区在一定时期内的公共用水，基本建设用水和数万名职工生活用水，就可以基本上得到供应。
    现在，负责勘察这条管线的石油工业部北京设计院的工作人员，已经开始了野外勘察活动。他们准备在十月底完成定测，年底交出初步设计资料，以便明年春天敷设。
    克拉玛依是十分缺水的地方，据水文地质人员调查，附近很少可以饮用的地下水。因此，需要修建输水管线，从玛纳斯河和艾里克湖等处，引水前来供应。
