Xinhua News Agency Dispatch:

    Fujian Province, a coastal region abundant in salt production, has begun to transport large quantities of edible salt to Yingtan and Nanchang in Jiangxi Province via the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway. By August 31, seventy-seven freight cars, totaling two thousand three hundred and ten tons, had been loaded and shipped.

    Fujian is one of China's major salt-producing provinces. Transporting salt from Nanping via the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway is more than thirty-one yuan cheaper per ton than the original road transport.

    据新华社讯　福建省沿海地区盛产的食盐，开始通过鹰厦铁路大批运往江西省鹰潭、南昌等地。到8月31日，装运了七十七车皮，共二千三百一十吨。
    福建是我国主要产盐省份之一，咸盐由南平经鹰厦铁路外运，比原来公路运输每一吨运费便宜三十一元多。
