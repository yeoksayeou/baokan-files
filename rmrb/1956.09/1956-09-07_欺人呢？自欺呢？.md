    Deceiving Others? Or Deceiving Oneself?
    Nan Cun
    It has been discovered in many areas that some agricultural production cooperatives are falsifying figures during the trial calculations for autumn harvest distribution. The methods of falsification are varied: some raise this year's production increase targets (for example, the Gaojian Agricultural Cooperative in Fenshui Township, Wanxian County, Sichuan, can only increase production by 15%, but calculates it as a 52% increase); some reduce the income figures of some members last year (for example, the Lianhe Agricultural Cooperative in Xunhua County, Qinghai, with the help of a work team, reduced the income figures of twenty members by a total of more than 730 yuan); some increase the labor work point figures of some members whose income may decrease (for example, in the Tuzhu Township Agricultural Cooperative in Leshan County, Sichuan, member Han Miaoxian can only do 100 work points, but the cooperative cadre calculated it as 328 points); some include items that cannot possibly generate income this year in this year's income (for example, some agricultural cooperatives in Jilin Province include newly planted fruit trees, pregnant calves and foals, and newly purchased beehives as this year's income; the Hongguang Agricultural Cooperative in Tiangang Township, Jiaohe County, has more than 2,000 yuan in this kind of empty income alone); some calculate only agricultural income when calculating members' income last year, and do not calculate sideline income, and so on.
    Although there are various methods of calculation, they all amount to calculating this year's income as more and calculating last year's income as less. What is the purpose? It is said to be to encourage the work enthusiasm of the members, to "guarantee" that 90% of the members will increase their income compared to last year. The empty income calculated by some agricultural cooperatives in Jilin Province was discovered by the higher-level leading organs; when they were asked to change those false figures, not only the cooperative cadres were unwilling, but even some county and district responsible cadres were unwilling. A county party secretary once said: "This cannot be changed, if these figures are changed, some agricultural cooperatives in our county will not be able to guarantee that 90% of the members will increase their income."
    Perhaps it can be said that the comrades who have falsified or tolerated falsification do not have bad subjective wishes. They may think: it is good to let the members see that production has increased a lot, income has increased a lot, and everyone is happy? Besides, everyone has worked hard for a year, and the production results are not small, but they have not yet reached the requirement that 90% of the members increase their income, which is always a bit embarrassing; adding a little falsehood to the accounts does not harm the members, and it sounds much better, so what is wrong with that?
    Even if it is all out of good intentions, these comrades should be told that their approach is very bad. The members will never be satisfied with their empty promises, and they will not be encouraged by these empty promises. On the contrary, these various methods of falsification will only cause the members to doubt the distribution policy and distrust the agricultural cooperative. In Xunhua County, Qinghai, after the work team in the Lianhe Agricultural Cooperative lowered the income of twenty members last year, a "distribution plan" was made that "93% of the members increased their income." When the plan was announced, the members who did not know the details were very happy. However, those twenty members said "this is deceiving people." As a result, everyone was talking about it, and some members who could have increased their income also became uneasy. In this case, how can the members' work enthusiasm be encouraged?
    What is worse, these false figures on paper and exaggerated achievements will make people numb and "rest easy"; while the problems in the work are covered up and cannot be solved. When the actual distribution comes, the problem becomes big, and it is too late to make up for it.
    Falsification is always a bad style of work that is irresponsible to the work and the masses. No good subjective wish can be used as an excuse for falsification. As for falsifying in order to "gain public favor" with some individualistic purpose, that is even worse.

    欺人呢？自欺呢？
    南村
    不少地区都发现一些农业生产合作社在进行秋收分配试算的时候作假。作假的办法是多种多样的：有的提高今年增产指标（如四川万县分水乡高枧农业社只能增产15％，却按增产52％计算）；有的削减部分社员去年收入数字（如青海循化县联合农业社经工作组帮助计算，把二十户社员去年的收入数字共减去七百三十多元）；有的加大部分可能减少收入的社员的劳动工分数字（如四川乐山县土主乡农业社社员韩妙仙只能做工一百分，社干部给算成三百二十八分）；有的把今年不可能有收入的项目也算入今年的收入部分（如吉林省的一些农业社把刚刚栽下的果树、还怀在肚子里的牛犊马驹、新买的蜂箱等都算作今年的收入，蛟河县天岗乡红光农业社仅这类空头收入的数字就有二千多元）；有的计算社员去年的收入只计算农业收入，不计算副业收入等等。
    算法虽有种种，其实都不外乎把今年的收入多算一些，把去年的收入少算一些。目的是什么呢？据说是为了鼓舞社员的劳动积极性，为了“保证”90％的社员比去年增加收入。吉林省一些农业社所计算的空头收入被上级领导机关发现了；当要求改掉那些虚假数字的时候，不仅社干部不愿意，就连某些县区负责干部也不愿意。有一位县委书记就曾这样说：“这可不能改掉，若是改掉了这些数字，我们县的一些农业社就不能保证90％的社员增加收入了。”
    也许可以说，这些作了假的或者容忍作假的同志，主观愿望也并不坏。他们可能认为：让社员看到增产很多，收入增加很大，大家都欢喜欢喜，有什么不好呢？再说，大家辛辛苦苦干了一年，生产成绩也不小，但是还没有达到90％的社员增加收入的要求，这总不免有些过意不去；在账目上掺一点假，社员并不受损失，而说起来却好听得多，这又有什么不可以呢？
    就算都是出于好心好意吧，也应该告诉这些同志，他们这种做法是很坏的。社员决不会满足于他们的空头支票，更不会因为这些空头支票而欢欣鼓舞。相反的，这种种作假办法只会使社员对分配政策发生怀疑，对农业社不信任。青海循化县在联合农业社的工作组把二十户社员去年的收入压低以后，“93％的社员增加了收入”的“分配方案”是做出来了。公布方案的时候，不明底细的社员听了很欢喜。可是，那二十户社员却说“这是骗人”。于是，大家议论纷纷，一些本来可以增加收入的社员也不安起来了。在这种情况下，社员的劳动积极性怎样鼓舞得起来呢？
    更糟的是，这些纸面上的假数字、夸大了的成绩会使人们麻痹起来，“高枕无忧”；而工作中的问题却被掩盖过去，得不到解决。等到实际分配的时候，问题闹大了，要弥补也来不及了。
    作假，无论如何总是一种对工作对群众不负责任的恶劣作风。任何善良的主观愿望，都不能作为作假的借口。至于为了“哗众取宠”，抱着某种个人主义的目的而作假，那就更不好了。
