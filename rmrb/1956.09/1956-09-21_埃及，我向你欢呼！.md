Egypt, I salute you! Tutankhamun has awakened from the pyramid, the Sphinx has roared, and the ancient "Book of the Dead" has revealed new pages of the history of human liberation. The tide of rebirth is surging through the Suez Canal, impacting every corner of the world. The whole world has your friends, justice is on your side, victory is on your side. Let the era of bandits ascending to the hall and entering the house be gone forever! The shattered shackles, who dares to put them back on the hands and feet of the master? The stewards of Western bankers, Dulles and his servants, are about to sit in the thick fog of the Thames again and make some muddled daydreams—they want to organize a "Users Association" to manage Egypt's Suez Canal. What a bizarre and absurd dream! Users can have the right to manage, wouldn't that mean that whoever uses US dollars can manage the US Treasury? This is the logic that Western bandits have used for hundreds of years, but it doesn't work today! Bandits have the freedom to have weird dreams, and associations have the freedom to organize—no need to be polite, not only organize one, but organize one thousand two hundred, but the Suez Canal was dug in Egypt, and the Egyptian people sacrificed 120,000 precious lives for it, it will always belong to Egypt, and it will always be managed by Egypt! Egypt has the right to nationalize the canal, it is prepared to redeem the shares of the canal company, and it guarantees the freedom of navigation of the canal, which has already been done with utmost benevolence and righteousness. However, the bandits use armed threats,妄想to create excuses, and launch a war of aggression against Egypt! Try it, whoever dares to invade Egypt, whoever dares to infringe upon Egypt's sovereignty by force, the Egyptian people have solemnly sworn: "Never let an aggressor survive!" The Arab countries have solemnly sworn: "To invade Egypt is to invade the Arab countries!" Yes, in order to defend peace, I also want to swear to the world: We Chinese people resolutely support the struggle of any nation against aggression; we organized volunteers to support Korea. Today, I am willing to be a member of the volunteer army and go to the banks of the Nile, under the pyramids, and fight side by side with the Egyptian brothers.

Egypt, I salute you! You are by no means isolated and helpless, the progressive forces of the whole world are concerned about you. Your victory is the common victory of all mankind, your victory is the lasting peace of the whole world. Let us fight until the liberation of all mankind! Not to shed our last drop of blood, but to make the stubborn colonialists shed their last drop of blood!

    埃及，我向你欢呼！
    郭沫若埃及，我向你欢呼！楚唐卡曼已从金字塔中醒来，斯芬克狮发出了吼声，古代的“死书”启示了人类解放史的新的篇页。新生的浪潮通过苏彝士运河荡击着世界的各个角落。全世界都有你的友人，正义是在你的方面，胜利是在你的方面。强盗们升堂入室的时代，让它永远过去吧！粉碎了的镣铐，谁敢再拿来加在主人的手足上？西方银行家的管事们，杜勒斯和他的仆从，要再一次坐在泰晤士的浓雾中做出一些糊涂的白日梦了——他们要组织一个“使用国协会”，管理埃及的苏彝士运河。真是扑朔离奇的怪梦啦！使用者就可以有权管理，岂不是谁使用美钞，就可以管理美国国库？这就是西方强盗们使用了几百年的逻辑，但在今天是行不通了！怪梦有强盗做的自由，协会也有强盗组织的自由——不必客气啦，不仅组织一个，尽可以组织一千二百个，但是苏彝士运河是在埃及境内掘成的，埃及人民为它牺牲了十二万人的宝贵生命，它永远是属于埃及的，它永远归于埃及管理！埃及有权把运河收为国有，它准备赎回运河公司的股权，它更保证了运河的自由通航，这已是做到了仁至义尽。然而强盗们却使用武装威胁，妄想制造借口，发动侵略埃及的战争！试试吧，谁敢侵略埃及，谁敢以武力侵犯埃及的主权，埃及人民已经庄严地宣誓：“决不让侵略者有一人生还！”阿剌伯国家都已经庄严地宣誓：“侵略埃及就是侵略阿剌伯国家！”是的，为了保卫和平，我也要向全世界宣誓：我们中国人民坚决地支持任何民族的反抗侵略的斗争；我们组织过志愿军支援朝鲜。我今天就甘愿作为志愿军的一员，走到尼罗河边，金字塔的下面，和埃及的兄弟们并肩作战。埃及，我向你欢呼！你决不是孤立无助的，全世界的进步力量都在关怀着你。你的胜利是全人类的共同胜利，你的胜利是全世界的持久和平。让我们斗争到全人类的解放吧！不是流尽我们最后一珠血，而是使冥顽的殖民主义者们流尽他们的最后一珠血！
