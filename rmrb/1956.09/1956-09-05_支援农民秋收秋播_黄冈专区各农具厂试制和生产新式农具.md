    Supporting Farmers in Autumn Harvest and Planting
    Huanggang Special District's Farm Implement Factories Trial-Produce and Manufacture New-Style Farm Tools
    (Our dispatch) The farm implement factories in Huanggang Special District are actively trial-producing and manufacturing a large number of new-style farm tools and improved farm tools to support farmers in the autumn harvest and planting. Up to now, the fifteen farm implement factories in the entire special district have trial-produced, and some have already put into production, more than ten kinds of new-style and improved farm tools, such as seed drills, manual threshers, animal-powered threshers, power-driven threshers, rice borer exterminating shovels, wooden double-shared plows, and modified double-shared plows for paddy fields.
    In the previous month, each factory conducted thorough investigations in rural areas, widely absorbing farmers' opinions on the quality, cost, and specifications of farm tools. Therefore, the products currently being trial-produced and manufactured have all undergone various forms of appraisal and testing, proving that they are more effective than old-style farm tools and are very popular among farmers. For example, the Daye Farm Implement Factory recently trial-produced wooden double-shared plows, which, after preliminary testing, showed that their work efficiency was more than 50% higher than that of old-style wooden plows. They are suitable for both paddy fields and dry land. According to preliminary calculations, the cost is more than six-fifths cheaper than iron double-shared plows, and it also saves the country a large amount of steel. The Huangmei County Farm Implement Factory successfully modified double-shared plows for use in paddy fields. After trial use by the county's reclamation team, the results proved to be very good, with one day capable of plowing nine mu of paddy fields, increasing efficiency two-fold compared to old plows, and also plowing the soil evenly. Now, each factory is producing them in large quantities. According to preliminary statistics, more than 1,000 units of various threshers have already been produced for the products that have been successfully trial-produced. At the same time, they are also mass-producing some improved farm tools and small farm tools according to needs.
    Some farm implement factories have also begun trial-producing farm tools needed for winter planting, preparing to support farmers in winter planting. (Zeng Yifu)

    支援农民秋收秋播
    黄冈专区各农具厂试制和生产新式农具
    本报讯　黄冈专区各农具厂积极试制和生产大批新式农具和改良农具，支援农民秋收秋种。全专区十五个农具厂到目前止，试制和部分已投入生产的有条播器、人力打谷机、畜力打谷机、动力打谷机、灭螟铲、木制双铧犁、改装双铧犁下水田等十多种新式和改良农具。
    各厂在前一个月普遍深入农村，进行全面调查，广泛吸收了农民对农具的质量、成本、规格等方面的意见。因此，现在所试制和生产的产品都经过不同的形式鉴定试验，证明比旧式农具效用高，很受农民喜爱。如大冶农具厂近来试制了木双铧犁，经初步试验，比旧式木犁工效高50％以上。水田、旱地都能适用。据初步计算，成本比铁制双铧犁便宜六分之五以上，还为国家节约大批钢材。黄梅县农具厂改装双铧犁下水田成功，经该县垦荒队试用，证明效果很好，一天可犁九亩水田，比老犁提高效率二倍，并且翻土均匀。现在各厂正在大量生产，已经试制成功的产品据初步统计，各种打谷机已生产了一千余台。同时，还根据需要大量生产些改良农具和小件农具。
    某些农具厂并且已经开始试制冬播需用的农具，准备支援农民冬播。　（曾一夫）
