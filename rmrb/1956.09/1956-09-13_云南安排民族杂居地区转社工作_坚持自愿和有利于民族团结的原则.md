    Yunnan arranges socialist transformation work in ethnically mixed areas
    Adhering to the principles of voluntariness and favoring ethnic unity

    According to Xinhua News Agency, the production cooperation department heads' meeting of the Yunnan Provincial Party Committee and Municipal Party Committee made unified arrangements for the issue of transitioning to socialist cooperatives in inland rural areas with multiple ethnic groups after the autumn harvest.

    Inland rural areas of Yunnan Province already achieved semi-socialist agricultural cooperation in the spring of this year, with farmers participating in advanced agricultural cooperatives accounting for 30% of the total number of farm households. On this basis, the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party plans to basically complete socialist agricultural cooperation after the autumn harvest. Considering that most of the areas transitioning to advanced cooperatives this autumn are mountainous and ethnically mixed regions, the meeting, in discussing the scale of advanced cooperatives, exchanged experiences and lessons learned from leading existing advanced cooperatives for more than half a year, and decided that no large cooperatives with more than 1,000 households should be established after autumn. If individual regions with the appropriate conditions want to establish large cooperatives with more than 500 households, they should also obtain approval from the prefectural party committee. According to natural conditions, living conditions, and ethnic characteristics, the meeting roughly determined: in plain areas, each advanced cooperative should generally have around 200 households; in semi-mountainous and mountainous areas, 100 to 200 households; and in scattered mountainous and high-altitude cold mountainous areas, advanced cooperatives of around 100 households or several dozen households should be established. The size of the production team must also be determined according to the number of households in the cooperative, based on the principle of facilitating production leadership and labor organization. The meeting also criticized the idea of ignoring ethnic conditions and blindly pursuing the establishment of large cooperatives, which currently exists among many cadres.

    The meeting also specially studied the issue of establishing multi-ethnic joint cooperatives or single-minority-ethnic cooperatives in ethnically mixed areas. The meeting believed that these two forms could coexist, but both must adhere to the principles of voluntariness of all ethnic groups and favoring the unity of all ethnic groups. During the transition to cooperatives, if minority ethnic group members are willing to unite, the majority ethnic group members must not refuse. If minority ethnic group members are willing to establish cooperatives independently, they can form single-ethnic cooperatives, or they can be organized into separate teams within a joint cooperative. In areas where various ethnic groups live together, emphasis should be placed on mutual assistance, mutual learning, and common improvement among all ethnic groups.

    Regarding the handling of various specific policies during the transition to cooperatives, since they all involve ethnic relations, the meeting believed that ethnic characteristics and special needs of ethnic groups must be taken into account, and the shortcomings of generalized leadership must be resolutely corrected. For example, when dealing with private plots, a certain amount of land should be reserved for the Yao and Miao ethnic groups in high-altitude cold mountainous areas who have the habit of growing indigo and ramie; when dealing with the issue of mountain forests, livestock, etc., joining the cooperative, in addition to reasonable pricing and paying attention to the interests of middle peasants, religious forests of minority ethnic groups such as the hunting god trees of the Lisu ethnic group and the dragon trees of the Yi ethnic group, as well as the yellow cattle eaten by the Hui ethnic group and the horses ridden by the Miao ethnic group, should be allowed to be handled by the cooperative members themselves.

    In order to smoothly complete the transition to cooperatives after the autumn harvest, the meeting deeply criticized the commandism and complacency that currently exist among some cadres. It was believed that ideological and organizational preparations should be made thoroughly and meticulously for the transition to cooperatives after the autumn harvest. In particular, backbones from minority ethnic groups should be actively cultivated in the preparation work for the transition to cooperatives.

    云南安排民族杂居地区转社工作
    坚持自愿和有利于民族团结的原则
    据新华社讯　中共云南省地委市委生产合作部长会议，对多民族杂居的内地农村秋后转社问题作了统一的布置。
    云南内地农村在今年春天就已经实现半社会主义农业合作化，参加高级社
  的农民占总农户的30％。在这个基础上，中共云南省委员会规划秋后基本完成社会主义农业合作化。鉴于今秋转高级社的地区，大部分是山区和民族杂居地区，会议在讨论高级社的规模的时候，交流了半年多来领导现有高级社的经验教训，决定秋后一律不办一千户以上的大社；个别具备条件的地区要办五百户以上的大社时，也应经过地委批准。按照自然条件、居住条件和民族特点，会议大体确定：在平坝地区每个高级社一般以二百户左右为宜；半山区和山区百多户到二百户；分散的山区和高寒山区应办一百户左右或几十户的高级社。生产队的大小，也必须按社的户数，便于领导生产和组织劳动力的原则来确定。会议并且对目前不少干部存在的忽视民族条件、盲目追求办大社的思想作了批判。
    会议还特别对民族杂居地区，办多民族联合社或单一少数民族合作社的问题作了研究。会议认为：这两种形式可以同时存在，但是都必须坚持各民族自愿和有利于各民族团结的原则。在转社中少数民族社员愿意联合，多数民族社员不得拒绝。少数民族社员愿意单独办社，可以组成单一的民族社，也可以在一个联合社内单独编队。在各民族杂居地区，都应强调各民族互相帮助，互相学习，共同提高。
    关于转社时各项具体政策的处理，因为都会涉及到民族关系，因此会议认为必须照顾民族特点和民族的特殊需要，坚决纠正领导一般化的缺点。如处理自留地时，对高寒山区有种蓝靛和苎麻习惯的瑶族、苗族，应多留出一定数量的土地；在处理山林、牲畜等入社问题时，除了合理折价、注意照顾中农的利益以外，对傈僳族的猎神树、彝族的龙树等少数民族的宗教树林，以及回族食用的黄牛、苗族自骑的马匹，都应该让社员自己处理。
    为了顺利完成秋后的转社工作，会议深入地批判了目前一些干部中的强迫命令作风和自满麻痹情绪。认为秋后转社应深入细致地作好思想准备和组织准备。特别应在转社的准备工作中，积极培养少数民族的骨干。
