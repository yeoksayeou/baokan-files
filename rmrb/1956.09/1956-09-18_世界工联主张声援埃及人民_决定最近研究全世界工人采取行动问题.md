Xinhua News Agency, Prague, September 17th: Louis Saillant, General Secretary of the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), stated in a telegram to Kamel, General Secretary of the Egyptian Trade Union Congress on September 15th: The WFTU supports the appeal made by the Egyptian Trade Union to trade union organizations worldwide as the threat of the British and French governments obstructing the normal navigation of the Suez Canal intensifies. It firmly advocates solidarity with the Egyptian people to resist the threat of imperialism.

Saillant's reply stated that the united and forceful protests of people worldwide can prevent the terrible conflict triggered by the Suez Canal navigation issue. This will also compel the British and French governments to respect their obligations under the United Nations Charter.

On the same day, the WFTU also telegraphed trade union organizations in all countries, asking them to pay attention to this matter. It requested them to urge workers to pay attention to the escalating threat of war and demanded that their respective governments resolve the Suez Canal issue through peaceful means that respect Egyptian sovereignty.

The WFTU Secretariat has decided to study the issue of worldwide workers' solidarity with Egyptian trade unions and workers during the 12th session of the Executive Committee and the 8th session of the WFTU Council at the end of September, which will be composed of trade union representatives from sixty countries.

    世界工联主张声援埃及人民
    决定最近研究全世界工人采取行动问题
    据新华社布拉格17日电　世界工联总书记路易·赛扬9月15日在给埃及工会大会总书记卡迈尔的一封电报中说：世界工联支持埃及工会在面临英法政府阻挠苏彝士运河正常通航的威胁日益加剧时向全世界工会组织发出的呼吁。它坚决主张声援埃及人民，以便抗击帝国主义的威胁。
    赛扬的复电说，全世界人民联合起来提出强有力的抗议是能够制止就苏彝士运河通航问题而发动的可怕的冲突的，这样他们还可以迫使英法政府尊重它们在联合国宪章下所负的义务。
    世界工联在同一天还打电报给所有国家的工会组织，请它们注意这件事。它要求它们促请工人们注意战争威胁的加剧，并且要求它们各自的政府以尊重埃及主权的和平办法来解决苏彝士运河问题。
    世界工联秘书处已经决定在执行委员会的第十二次会议期间，和在9月底由六十个国家的工会代表组成的世界工联理事会第八次会议上研究全世界工人声援埃及的工会和工人的问题。
