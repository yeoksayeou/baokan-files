Xinhua News Agency, September 15th: TASS, Damascus, September 14th: "Al-Barada" newspaper published a statement by Syrian Prime Minister Said Ghazzi on the Western countries' proposed plan to establish a "Suez Canal Users Association." The statement indicated that the Syrian government believes that implementing the Western countries' plan constitutes an infringement on Egyptian sovereignty.

The statement pointed out that Egypt's proposal to reconvene a conference to discuss the Suez Canal issue opens the way for negotiations to peacefully resolve the Suez Canal issue.

The Syrian government reiterated its support for Egypt's struggle to defend its own security and the security of other Arab countries.

Xinhua News Agency, September 15th: TASS, Cairo, September 14th: According to the Middle East News Agency, Arab League Secretary-General Abdul-Khaleq Hassouna said that the plan to establish the so-called "Suez Canal Users Association" carries a clear provocative nature. He believes this plan is an attempt to "restore the old methods of 19th-century imperialism."

The Arab League Secretary-General said that Britain and France incited foreign employees working on the Suez Canal to resign, "trying to find an excuse for aggression."

Hassouna pointed out that these actions by Britain and France may complicate the situation in the canal, and he emphasized that the governments of Britain and France should be held responsible for this.

    指责西方侵犯埃及主权的计划
    据新华社15日讯　塔斯社大马士革14日讯：“巴拉达报”刊载了叙利亚总理赛义德·加齐就西方国家提出成立“苏彝士运河使用国协会”计划一事所发表的声明。声明表明，叙利亚政府认为，实行西方国家的计划，就是侵犯埃及的主权。
    声明指出，埃及提出的关于重新召开讨论苏彝士运河问题的会议的建议开辟了为和平解决苏彝士运河问题而进行谈判的道路。
    叙利亚政府重申，它支持为保卫自己和其他阿拉伯国家的安全而奋斗的埃及。
    据新华社15日讯　塔斯社开罗14日讯：据中东通讯社报道，阿拉伯联盟秘书长阿卜杜勒—哈勒克·哈苏纳说，建立所谓“苏彝士运河使用国协会”的计划带有明显的挑衅性质。他认为这个计划是“恢复十九世纪帝国主义老办法”的企图。
    这位阿拉伯联盟秘书长说，英法两国怂恿在苏彝士运河上工作的外籍职工离职，“想为侵略找借口”。
    哈苏纳指出，英法两国的这种行动可能引起运河局势复杂化，他强调指出，英法两国政府对此应当负责。
