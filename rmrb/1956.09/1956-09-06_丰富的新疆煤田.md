Rich Xinjiang Coalfields
Ma Song

In China's northwest frontier—the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region—there are rich coalfields. Due to the lack of large-scale exploration and mining in the past, these coalfields are not as well known to the country as the Fushun, Fuxin, Kailuan, and Datong coalfields.

Xinjiang's coalfields are distributed in the Tianshan, Kunlun, and Altai Mountains, with the Tianshan coalfields having the widest distribution and the largest reserves. The coalfields north of the Tianshan Mountains stretch for four to five hundred kilometers from Qitai in the east to Usu in the west, with coal seams up to hundreds of meters thick. There are also some coalfields in Luntai, Baicheng, and Wensu south of the Tianshan Mountains, where local residents have already been mining using indigenous methods; due to insufficient geological exploration, the coal reserves on the southern slopes of the Tianshan Mountains cannot be estimated at present. The Kunlun Mountains' northern coalfield is distributed in the Hotan, Shache, and Yengisar areas, with a total length of about four hundred and fifty kilometers. On the northern edge of the Junggar Basin, coalfields extend for more than two hundred kilometers from Hoboksar Mongol Autonomous County to Emin County. The Altai Mountain coalfields are scattered in Jimunai, Fuhai, and Qinghe counties. According to existing data, the total coal reserves in Xinjiang are estimated at about 41.9 billion tons, exceeding the reserves in the Northeast and Central South regions.

Xinjiang not only has abundant coal resources but also a wide variety of types, including lignite, lignitous bituminous coal, long-flame coal, gassy coking coal, high-quality coking coal, and lean coal for auxiliary coking. Lignite, long-flame coal, and gassy coal are good fuels for power, with calorific values generally ranging from 5,000 to 8,000 calories, which can supply the Lanzhou-Urumqi-Aktogay railway and other industrial and civil uses. Gassy coking coal, coking coal, and lean coal are good blending coking coals that can support future steel bases.

More than a hundred years ago, residents of Xinjiang used indigenous methods to mine coal. Due to backward technology, coal dust was left underground after mining, and over time, the phenomenon of spontaneous combustion of weathered coal became very serious. In some coalfields, underground fires have burned for decades, or even more than a hundred years. According to investigations, mine fires have occurred in at least fifteen counties. In Urumqi alone, the loss from underground coalfield fires is estimated at more than 150,000 tons per year. In order to extinguish the underground coalfield fires, the Xinjiang Coal Mining Administration has formulated a preliminary treatment plan for the fire areas in the region and will establish a specialized organization for extinguishing them.

With the Lanxin Railway extending further westward, Xinjiang is on the eve of large-scale industrial construction. Therefore, this year the Ministry of Coal Industry has made a comprehensive development plan for key construction of Xinjiang coalfields and zonal supply. After the plan is realized, the coal production capacity of the entire region will increase twenty times compared to the present. Urumqi will become one of the largest coal bases in the Northwest. At present, the Liudaowan coalfield in Urumqi is undergoing some geological work following the advice of Soviet experts and will be built into a fully modern large-scale open-pit coal mine. Drilling at the Sidaocha coalfield will also begin this year, with construction starting next year.

    丰富的新疆煤田
    马崧
    在我国西北边疆——新疆维吾尔自治区，有着丰富的煤田。由于以前没有大规模地勘探和开采，这里的煤田不像抚顺、阜新、开滦、大同等煤田那样为全国所知晓。
    新疆的煤田，分布在天山、昆仑山和阿尔泰山一带，其中以天山煤田分布最广，储量最多。天山以北的煤田，东起奇台、西至乌苏、绵延四、五百公里，煤层厚达百余公尺。天山以南的轮台，拜城和温宿等处，也有一些煤田，当地居民已用土法开采；由于地质勘探力量不足，天山南麓煤的蕴藏量，目前还无法估计。昆仑山北麓煤田分布在和阗、莎车、英吉沙一带，全长约四百五十公里。在准噶尔盆地北边，从和布克赛尔蒙古族自治县到额敏县，延伸着两百多公里的煤田。阿尔泰山煤田则散见于吉木乃、福海、青河各县。据现有的资料估计，全疆储煤量约四百一十九亿吨，超过了东北、中南各区的储量。
    新疆不但煤源丰富，品种也很多，有褐煤、褐性烟煤、长焰煤、瓦斯肥煤、焦性良好的肥煤和辅助炼焦的瘦煤。褐煤、长焰煤、瓦斯煤是良好的燃料动力用煤，发热一般都在五千至八千卡，可以供应兰州——乌鲁木齐——阿克斗卡铁路及其他工业用途和民用。瓦斯肥煤、肥煤和瘦煤是良好的配合炼焦煤类，可以支援未来的钢铁基地。
    一百多年前，新疆的居民就用土法采煤。由于技术落后，开采之后，将煤沫遗在井下，天长日久，煤炭风化自燃的现象很严重。有的煤田，地下火燃烧达几十年，甚至有百余年的。据调查，至少有十五个县发生矿山火灾，仅乌鲁木齐一地，煤田地下火的损失，每年估计达十五万吨以上。为了扑灭煤田的地下火，新疆煤矿管理局制定了全区煤田火区初步处理方案，并将成立专门机构扑救。
    随着兰新铁路日益向西伸展，新疆正处在大规模的工业建设的前夜。因此，今年煤炭工业部作出了关于新疆煤田重点建设，分区供应的全面开发规划。规划实现后，全疆煤的生产能力将较现在提高二十倍。乌鲁木齐将成为西北最大的煤炭基地之一。目前乌鲁木齐六道湾井田正按苏联专家建议，补做某些地质工作，将建成为一座完全现代化的大型露天煤矿，四道岔井田也将在今年开始钻探，明年动工兴建。
