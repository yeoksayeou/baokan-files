The Southern Daily published a commentator's article on July 9th, entitled "Respect Opera Performers, Protect the Legitimate Rights and Interests of Troupes and Performers," exposing the illegal and undisciplined phenomena of harassment, insult, and extortion of opera performers in many places in Guangdong. For example, when the Jinxiu Opera Troupe performed in Gaozan Township, Eighth District, Shunde County, local cadres, under the pretext of "maintaining public order," charged the troupe a "militia supper fee" of sixteen yuan, forcing the troupe to take out a loan from the credit cooperative and use the performers' food expenses to cover it; in Luoding County, the wife of a police station chief frequently watched performances without buying tickets, and when the troupe staff made some suggestions to her, the police station chief ordered the entire troupe to conduct a "self-criticism," and so on. Some veteran artists said sadly, "Before liberation, we performers couldn't hold our heads up, we couldn't see the sky, and now that we've raised our heads, we still can't see the sky!" What a painful accusation! Who can read this without feeling indignant?

The illegal and undisciplined phenomena of harassing, insulting, and extorting opera performers are by no means limited to Guangdong; they also exist in other places. Some time ago, I heard of the following incident: a local police station, because the troupe did not give them free tickets, went to the troupe's accommodation every night at midnight to "check household registrations," checking for two or three hours at a time, leaving the actors exhausted and afraid to protest. A certain local party committee leader, because the troupe did not come to "pay their respects," summoned the troupe leader for a "scolding." Are these phenomena that we can tolerate?

In the old society, persecution, humiliation, and extortion of opera performers were commonplace, and artists couldn't help but shed tears when they talked about the past. After liberation, their status improved, and they received the care and attention of the Party and the government; however, a few cadres still treat them with the style of old society masters. In the eyes of those people, opera performers are "loafers," are "just actors," and don't count for anything at all; they have to do whatever they are told. These staff members completely disregard the Party and government's policies and decrees, and act recklessly. They are not only ignorant of policies, but also don't know what human rights are!

    为戏曲艺人不平
    林涵表
    南方日报7月9日刊载了一篇评论员的评论，题为“尊重戏曲艺人，保障剧团和艺人的合法权益”，揭发了广东许多地方刁难、侮辱、勒索戏曲艺人的违法乱纪现象。例如：锦绣剧团在顺德县第八区高赞乡演出的时候，当地的干部借口“维持治安”，向剧团收取“民兵宵夜费”十六元，迫得剧团向信用合作社贷款，并且把艺人的伙食费也拿出来应付；罗定县有一个派出所所长的妻子，因为经常看戏不买票，剧团工作人员向她提了一些意见，这个派出所所长竟责令剧团全团进行“反省”，等等。有些老艺人伤心地说：“解放前我们演戏的不能够抬头，不能够见天，现在抬了头还是不能够见天！”这是多么沉痛的控诉啊！谁看了能不感到愤慨？
    刁难、侮辱、勒诈戏曲艺人的违法乱纪现象绝不只是广东有，其他地方也有。前些时候，我就听到过这样的事情：某地派出所因为剧团不送票，于是每晚半夜到剧团住宿地点“查户口”，一查就两三个钟头，弄得演员疲乏不堪，又不敢抗议。某地某党委负责人因剧团不来“拜望”，于是召剧团团长来“训”了一顿。这些现象难道是我们可以容忍的吗？
    在旧社会里，戏曲艺人受迫害，被凌辱，被勒诈曾是家常便饭，艺人一谈起往事就情不自禁地落泪。解放后他们的地位提高了，他们受到党和政府的关怀重视；可是却有少数干部仍然拿旧社会老爷的作风对待他们。在那些人的眼睛里，戏曲艺人是“二流子”，是“唱戏的”，根本不算什么，要他怎样就得怎样。这些工作人员根本不管党和政府的政策法令，肆意横行。他们非但目无政策，而且不知道什么叫做人权！
