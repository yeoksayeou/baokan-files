    Two Hydropower Stations
    --An Albanian Travelogue
    Lin Li
    The car moves forward into the mountains.
    We climb one high mountain after another. Each mountain we pass seems lower than the one ahead.
    The road is treacherous, with one sharp turn after another. The car runs like a *yangge* dance, now up, now down, now left, now right.
    The mountains in Albania are high and the rocks are large, but it doesn't look barren at all. Up and down the mountains, there are green olive trees everywhere, and lush, verdant vineyards. At first glance, it looks like a green ocean.
    Our driver used to be an excellent guerrilla fighter, having performed meritorious service in Albania's War of Liberation. Now, he drives his car, taking his Chinese guests to the Lenin Hydropower Station. He seems to be deliberately showing off his wit and bravery, refusing to reduce the car's speed no matter how dangerous the road.
    Perhaps to reduce our worries about the dangerous road, the famous Albanian poet Fatmir Gjata vividly told us stories about the mountains in this speeding car.
      "Have you heard the story of the mountains?" the poet asked. But without waiting for our answer, he quickly continued: "Albania has so many and such large mountains, all because of God's negligence."
    The poet's interesting words immediately aroused our interest. Everyone urged him to continue. He said that when God created the world, he had arranged everything properly, where the mountains should be and where the water should be. But at the end, he suddenly discovered that he still had a few pebbles left in his pocket. Where should he put these pebbles? God was worried. Because in his view, the world had already been arranged very rationally, and no place needed these remaining pebbles. After thinking about it, he finally said: "Okay! Let's put them in Albania!"
      "As a result," the poet said with a humorous smile, "our beautiful Albania suddenly became a country with many mountains and many rocks."
    As he spoke, the car rushed down a steep slope. Before we could think about anything, the car suddenly braked. The poet said: "We're here, this is the Lenin Hydropower Station."
    We got out of the car and looked around for the hydropower station's factory buildings and machines. But all we saw were mountains connected to mountains and ridges next to ridges. The few white houses scattered in the mountain valleys looked neither like factory buildings nor like ordinary residences. A small stone-columned archway had the words "Lenin Hydropower Station" written on it. To the left of the archway was a guard, and to the right was a stone bust of Lenin. Inside the archway, there was only a tightly closed gate. "Where is the hydropower station?" Before my question could be asked, I saw five or six people coming out of the white houses in the distance. They seemed to be coming to welcome us. Sure enough, the visitors expressed their warm welcome to the Chinese guests. At the same time, they said modestly:
      "Please come in! Come and see the generators!"
    The person in charge was Bajki Dizmagjysh. He turned sideways and pushed open the tightly closed iron gate at the foot of the mountain.
    At this time, just like in fairy tales: as soon as the mountain gate opened, a deafening roar came from inside. The further we went in, the louder the roar and the lower the temperature. We felt a coolness all over. The cave was dome-shaped, with railways on the ground and electric lights on the ceiling and walls, looking very much like the Moscow subway. We followed Bajki Dizmagjysh inward, and it was a long time before we saw the generators, transformers, and central control room that we had been looking for for so long. It turned out that all these "treasures" were hidden in the deep mountain cave.
    With curious hearts, we looked at every part of the hydropower station. There were not many people, and the roar of the machines was particularly loud. The engineer said that these machines were all supplied by the Soviet Union. Because there were many automatic devices, very little manual labor was required. This hydropower station has a total of only forty-five people. Only four people manage the generators.
    The Lenin Hydropower Station was the first major construction project after Albania's liberation. Construction began in August 1947 and was completed on November 8, 1951. The hydropower station's water source is drawn from the deep mountains thirty-six kilometers away. To draw water for power generation, people opened up several high mountains, passed through a seven-kilometer-long tunnel, and laid six kilometers of water pipes.
    The Lenin Hydropower Station supplies electricity for lighting and industry to four cities, including Tirana, Durrës, and Kavajë, and several villages. But when introducing the role of the hydropower station, people often put the water supply problem first. Because before liberation, Tirana, the capital of Albania, did not have a water source. People who lived on wages usually paid more for water than for food. People who lived even harder drank dirty and smelly water year after year. So when the water from the Lenin Hydropower Station was first delivered to Tirana, people rejoiced and shouted "Long live the Labor Party!" This feeling for water is still very strong today. When we finished our visit and walked out of the stone archway of the hydropower station, Bajki Dizmagjysh had already asked his assistant to prepare a large bottle of water. After the poet Fatmir said "Cheers" in Chinese, he said:
      "The water from the Lenin Hydropower Station is cooler than soda and purer than beer!"
    Under the poet's enthusiastic encouragement, we, who were not used to drinking cold water, also drank a full glass without hesitation.
    The cool water left us with an unforgettable impression. The arduous struggle of opening mountains and chiseling rocks allowed us to see the great spirit of the Albanian people in peaceful construction. But when we repeatedly praised the Lenin Hydropower Station project, Fatmir surprisingly waved his hand. He said that while this project was indeed great in 1951, it was nothing compared to the Enver Hoxha Hydropower Station that was under construction.
    Three days later, we took the same car and headed towards the Enver Hoxha Hydropower Station.
    The car traveled at a speed of sixty kilometers per hour for about three hours. More than half of the time was spent winding through the deep mountains with high mountains, dangerous roads, and undulating peaks. How big are the mountains in this area? How high are the ridges? How dangerous is the road? I don't want to give more explanation. But there is a wonderful legend that must be narrated here.
    The first step in the construction of the Enver Hoxha Hydropower Station was to open up a road in the deep mountain valleys. Otherwise, mechanical equipment and construction materials could not be transported, and construction could not be carried out. To open up this road, the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party held a special meeting and issued special calls and resolutions. The Labor Party's call asked young people to bravely participate in the road construction project with the heroic spirit of defeating the fascist bandits, just like their elders.
    Just as the road construction project began, a group of young people climbed a mountain peak that had never been visited by humans. Suddenly, an old man with a white beard appeared before them. The old man said that the mountains in this area never receive strangers, and his only neighbor is the eagle. To confirm this, the old man said that the Turks had rampaged in Albania for four hundred and fifty years and had never climbed this ridge. Fascist bandits armed to the teeth had only looked at the shadow of this mountain. Geologists from the Austro-Hungarian Empire had climbed to the edge of the mountain, but had not entered the mountain. After the old man with the white beard said these words, he advised the young men to pack their luggage and return to Tirana as soon as possible. He repeated, "This is where the eagles live. Humans can never come."
    The heroic Albanian youth were not frightened by this magical and strange legend. On the contrary, it strengthened people's confidence and courage to create miracles. The young people completed the forty-eight-kilometer-long road within the scheduled time, built bridges, and hung thousands of lights along the way. At this time, the old man with the white beard came out leisurely again. As soon as he appeared, he said with a smile:
      "Haha! So you are real eagles—human eagles. You truly deserve to be called Albanian heroes."
    The eagle is a symbol of perseverance, bravery, and never yielding in Albania, and has been the background of the national emblem for five hundred years. This road built by "eagles" is now called the "Road of Light." It shows that the Enver Hoxha Hydropower Station has passed the most difficult journey.
    The construction of the hydropower station has been going on for four years. The large sluice gate across the Mati River has only been half built in four years. It is like a gate in a deep valley, widening and forming day and night. The five villages near the sluice gate have been moved away. Replacing them are concrete mixing stations and reinforced concrete processing plants specially set up for the construction site. The roar of excavators replaced the howling of jackals. All kinds of cranes accompany the construction along with the towering ancient trees....
    The secretary of the construction site's Party committee, Kani Omli, told us that the construction scale of the Enver Hoxha Hydropower Station is unprecedented. The power generation is four times greater than that of the Lenin Hydropower Station. It not only supplies electricity to the cities and villages in the northern half of Albania, but also forms a power grid with power plants in Tirana and other places, so that central and southern Albania can also get its heat and light. Omli said that the entire project consists of sixteen items, and four items have been completed in the past 4 years. The remaining twelve items must be completed before 1957. He said that the reason why not many projects were completed in the past was because the technical level was not high. The builders learned as they worked, and some learned before they did. After 4 years of practical training, the technology has improved, and the project speed can be greatly accelerated. He said that now they are not only working hard for the construction project, but also preparing for power generation. For this purpose, they have opened a technical school with 120 students. With these people, future power generation will not be learned as it is done. Omli introduced everything on the construction site, but he was most deeply moved by the glory of being a member of the socialist camp.
    Omli looked up at the large sluice gate in front of him and continued with joy: "Look! From the initial blueprint of the Enver Hoxha Hydropower Station to the latest power generation equipment, everything is supplied by the Soviet Union. Our construction site has bulldozers and cranes from Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Democratic Germany, and other construction machines from Hungary, Bulgaria, and Romania. Chinese performing arts troupes have also performed here and participated in voluntary labor." His conclusion was: "The Enver Hoxha Hydropower Station has the hard work of Soviet comrades, the sweat of Chinese comrades, and the friendship of various fraternal countries."
    The construction of the Enver Hoxha Hydropower Station has not yet been completed, but the builders are discussing the next project with relish. They said that in two years, they will go to southern Albania to build the third and larger hydropower station for the motherland. After this third hydropower station is completed, Albania will have a national power grid running through the north and south. Albania's level of electrification will also be able to catch up with the advanced countries in the world.

    两个水电站
    ——阿尔巴尼亚纪行
    林里
    汽车向山野前进。
    爬过一座高山，又一座高山。走过的高山，总没有前面的更高。
    路很险，又是一个接连一个的急转弯。汽车跑起来像是扭秧歌，忽上忽下，忽左忽右。
    阿尔巴尼亚的山高，石头大，但一点也不显得荒秃。山上山下，到处是绿油油的橄榄树，到处是青葱茂盛的葡萄林。一眼看去，活像一片碧绿的海洋。
    我们的司机以前是个出色的游击队员。在阿尔巴尼亚解放战争中立过功勋。现在，他驾驶着汽车，带着他的中国客人向列宁水电站进发。他像是故意显示他的机智和勇敢，不管遇到多么险峻的路，都不肯把汽车的速度减低。
    大概是为了减少我们对于险路的担心，那位著名的阿尔巴尼亚诗人法特米尔·嘉达，就在这风驰电掣般的汽车里，绘声绘色地讲起了山的故事。
      “你们听过山的故事吗？”诗人问道。但他并不等我们回答，就赶紧接下去说：“阿尔巴尼亚有这么多又这么大的山，这全是因为上帝的疏忽。”
    诗人的有趣的话一下引起了我们的兴趣。大家不约而同地催他说下去。他说在上帝创造世界的时候，哪里应该是山，哪里应该是水，他全都安排得妥妥贴贴。可是临了忽然发现他的口袋里还剩下几块石头子。把这些石头子放到哪儿呢？上帝发了愁。因为照他的看法，世界已经安排得很合理，哪儿也不需要这些剩余的石头子了。他想来想去，终于说：“好吧！就把它们放在阿尔巴尼亚吧！”
      “这一来不打紧，”诗人诙谐地笑着说：“我们美丽的阿尔巴尼亚，就一下变成了山多石头多的国家了。”
    说话之间，汽车朝着一条陡峭的坡路，急转直下地冲了过去。我们还没有来得及思考什么，汽车就一下刹住了。诗人说：“到了，这儿就是列宁水电站。”
    我们下了车，举目搜寻水电站的厂房和机器。可是看来看去，只看见山连着山，岭挨着岭。分散在山沟里的几座白色小屋，既不像厂房建筑，又不像普通住户。一座不大的、用石柱砌成的拱门，上面写着“列宁水电站”字样。拱门左边有一位卫兵，右边是石雕的列宁半身像。拱门里边，也只有一座紧闭着的大门。“水电站在哪儿呢？”我的问话还没有出口，就看见远处的白色小屋里走出五、六个人。看样子是来迎接我们的。果然，来人满怀热情地表示了对中国客人的欢迎。同时谦逊地说：
      “请吧！到发电机跟前看看去吧！”
    负责人是拜基·蒂兹玛谷什。他侧身一转，顺手推开了山脚跟前的那座紧闭着的铁门。
    这时候，就像童话里所描写的那样：山门一开，里面便传来震耳欲聋的轰轰隆隆的吼声。越往里走，吼声越大，气温也越低。混身上下，感到凉丝丝的。山洞呈穹形，地上有铁路，顶棚和靠壁有电灯，样子很像莫斯科的地下电车道。我们随着拜基·蒂兹玛谷什往里走，一直走了很久，才看见我们久寻而不见的发电机、变电器和总操作室。原来，这些“宝贝儿”全部藏在深深的山洞里。
    我们怀着一颗好奇的心，把水电站的各个部分看了一遍。人不多，机器的吼声特别大。工程师说，这些机器全是苏联供给的。因为自动装置多，所以人工劳动就非常少。这样一个水力发电站，总共才有四十五个人。管理发电机的只有四个人。
    列宁水电站是阿尔巴尼亚解放后的第一个大建筑。它是1947年8月动工，1951年11月8日完成的。水电站的水源，是从三十六公里以外的深山里引来的。为了引水发电，人们凿开了好几座高山，穿过了七公里长的山洞，又铺设了六公里的输水管。
    列宁水电站供给地拉那、都拉斯和卡瓦雅等四个城市和若干乡村的照明用电和工业用电。但在介绍水电站的作用时，人们往往把供水问题摆在第一位。因为解放前，作为阿尔巴尼亚首都的地拉那，并没有水源。依靠工薪过活的人，通常付出的水费比饭费还高。生活更苦一点的人，就成年累月地喝着又脏又臭的水。所以当列宁水电站的水初次送到地拉那的时候，人们欢欣鼓舞，齐声高呼“劳动党万岁！”这种对水的情感，直到今天还十分强烈，当我们参观完毕，走出水电站的石拱门时，拜基·蒂兹玛谷什早已叫他的助手准备好了一大瓶水。诗人法特米尔用中国话说过“干杯”以后说道：
      “列宁水电站的水，比汽水还清凉，比啤酒更醇美！”
    在诗人的热情鼓动下，没有喝惯凉水的我们，也就毫不踌躇地喝了满满一大杯。
    清凉的水给我们留下了难忘的印象。开山凿石的艰苦斗争，使我们看见了阿尔巴尼亚人在和平建设方面的伟大气魄。但在我们连声称赞列宁水电站工程的时候，法特米尔却出人意外地摆了摆手。他说这个工程在1951年来说固然是伟大的，但是要跟正在建设中的恩维尔·霍查水电站相比，那就算不得什么了。
    三天以后，我们坐着原来那辆小汽车，向恩维尔·霍查水电站前进了。
    汽车以每小时六十公里的速度，走了大约三小时。其中半数以上的时间，是在山高路险、峰峦起伏的深山里盘旋。这一带的山有多大？岭有多高？路有多险？我不想去作更多说明。但有一个美妙的传说，是不能不在这里叙述的。
    恩维尔·霍查水电站的第一步工程，是在深山峡谷中开辟一条道路。要不然，机械设备和建筑器材没法运来，建设工程也不能进行。为了开辟这条路，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会召开过专门的会议，发布过专门的号召和决议。劳动党的号召中，要青年人像他们的长辈一样，用战胜法西斯强盗的英雄精神，勇敢地参加筑路工程。
    就在筑路工程开始的时候，一群青年人登上了从无人迹的山峰。忽然，眼前出现了一个白胡子老头。这位老人说，这一带的群山从不接待生人，他的唯一邻居是苍鹰。为了证实这句话，老人说，过去土耳其人在阿尔巴尼亚横行霸道四百五十年，始终没有上过这道岭。武装到牙齿的法西斯强盗，也只看了看这座山的阴影。奥匈帝国的地质学家，虽然攀登到山的边缘，但没有来到山中。白胡子老头说完这些话，就劝小伙子们收起行李，赶快回地拉那。他又重复地说：“这儿是苍鹰的所在。人类永远不能来。”
    英勇的阿尔巴尼亚青年，没有被这神奇古怪的传说所吓倒。相反的，却增强了人们创造奇迹的信心和勇气。青年人在预定的时间内修好了全长四十八公里的道路，架起了桥梁，还在沿途挂起了千万盏明灯。这时候，白胡子老头又悠哉游哉地走了出来，他一露面，就满脸带笑地说：
      “哈哈！原来你们是真正的鹰——人类的鹰。你们真正不愧为阿尔巴尼亚的英雄。”
    鹰，在阿尔巴尼亚是坚毅、勇敢，永不屈服的象征，是五百年来的国徽背景。这条“鹰”筑的路，现在叫做“光明之路”。它表明恩维尔·霍查水电站已走过了最艰巨的里程。
    水电站的建筑工程已经进行了四年。那座横跨麦蒂河的大水闸，四年当中才建造了一半。它像深谷大壑中的一扇大门，日日夜夜在加宽、形成。原在水闸左近的五个乡村搬走了。代替它的是专为工地而设的洋灰拌搅站和钢筋混凝土加工厂。掘土机的吼声代替了豺狼的嗥叫。各种各样的起重吊车，跟参天古树一起，陪伴着工程进行……。
    工地党委书记卡尼·奥姆利对我们说，恩维尔·霍查水电站的建筑规模是空前的。发电量比列宁水电站大四倍。它不仅供应阿尔巴尼亚北半部的城乡用电，而且还要跟地拉那等地的发电厂组成一个电力网，使阿尔巴尼亚中部和南部，也能得到它的热和光。奥姆利说，全部工程是十六个项目，以往4年完成了四个项目。剩下的十二项要在1957年前完成。他说过去完成的项目所以不多，是因为技术水平不高。建设者们是随做随学，有的是学会了再做。经过4年的实际锻炼，技术提高了，工程速度也可以大大加快了。他说现在他们不光为建筑工程而努力，而且还要为发电做准备。为了这个目的，他们开办了技术学校，现有一百二十名学员。有了这些人，将来发电就不会随做随学了。奥姆利介绍了工地上的一切，但他感触最深的还是作为社会主义阵营一员的光荣。
    奥姆利抬头看了看眼前的大水闸，喜形于色地继续说：“看吧！恩维尔·霍查水电站的最初一张蓝图，到最新型的发电设备，都是苏联供给的。我们的工地上，有来自波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、民主德国的推土机和起重机，有来自匈牙利、保加利亚和罗马尼亚的其他建筑机器。中国的文工团也在这里举行过演出，还参加过义务劳动。他的结论是：恩维尔·霍查水电站上，有苏联同志的心血，有中国同志的汗水，有各个兄弟国家的友谊。
    恩维尔·霍查水电站的建设工程还没有完结，建设者们却在津津乐道地讨论着下一个工程。他们说，两年以后，他们要到阿尔巴尼亚南方，为祖国建设第三个，也是更大的一个水电站。这第三个水电站建成后，阿尔巴尼亚就有了贯通南北的全国性的电力网。阿尔巴尼亚的电气化水平，也就可以赶上世界上的先进国家了。
