Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 7th. The Organization Department of the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently held a symposium on organizational work in border areas to study the work of Party building in minority ethnic regions of Yunnan.

In recent years, the work of Party building in ethnic minority areas of Yunnan's border regions has achieved some success, with more than 500 village branches established among various ethnic groups. However, some cadres still have varying degrees of ideological obstacles when carrying out Party building work in minority ethnic regions. For example, some cadres do not pay attention to studying the historical conditions of local minority ethnic groups, and simply compare the level of consciousness and education between Han cadres and minority ethnic cadres; some cadres oppose the mass religious beliefs of minority ethnic groups as feudal superstition; or people who have participated in mass ethnic revenge incidents are all listed as ineligible to join the Party. Many cadres also confuse the legitimate ethnic feelings of minority ethnic groups with narrow-minded nationalism, considering it a sign of backwardness. These ideological obstacles have affected the normal development of Party building work in the border areas. Some counties have only developed two Party members in half a year, and some directly affiliated agencies of autonomous prefectures have not even developed a single minority ethnic Party member in half a year.

Through discussions at this symposium, the attending cadres recognized that actively carrying out Party building work in ethnic minority border areas and cultivating ethnic cadres with communist consciousness is the core issue for completing the fundamental tasks of the Party in ethnic work as determined by the First Congress of the Communist Party of China in Yunnan Province. Everyone agreed that because there are many ethnic groups in the border areas, and the political, economic, and cultural development of each ethnic group is very uneven, the Party building work in these areas must adhere to Party principles while taking into account ethnic characteristics. The methods adopted for Party building work in minority ethnic areas should not only be different from those in Han areas, but also should not be completely the same between different ethnic groups, or even between different branches within the same ethnic group. Experience has shown that wherever it is possible to specifically analyze the different historical conditions of various ethnic groups, proceed from the actual situation, and actively and patiently help and cultivate minority ethnic activists, the Party building work has achieved good results. For example, a group of Party members has been developed among cadres of the Kawa, Lisu, and Kucong ethnic groups as a result. Conversely, some areas have departed from the actual situation of minority ethnic groups and mechanically applied the experience of Party building in Han areas. As a result, not only has the progress of Party building work been slow, but it has also brought some unnecessary concerns to minority ethnic activists.

The symposium also studied in detail the issue of cultivating and educating those from minority ethnic groups who are being considered for Party membership, and made some specific provisions for some special issues in Party building work in minority ethnic areas.

### 既要坚持党的原则　又要照顾民族特点  云南省委研究边疆地区的建党工作

    既要坚持党的原则　又要照顾民族特点
    云南省委研究边疆地区的建党工作
    新华社昆明7日电　中共云南省委员会组织部最近举行边疆组织工作座谈会，研究云南边疆少数民族地区的党的建设工作。
    几年来，云南边疆民族地区的建党工作已经取得了一定的成绩，先后在各民族中建立了五百多个乡村支部。但是，有些干部在少数民族地区进行建党工作时还有程度不同的思想障碍，如有的干部不注意研究当地少数民族的历史条件，单纯从汉族干部与少数民族干部的觉悟程度、文化水平上比较；有的干部把少数民族群众性的宗教信仰当作封建迷信加以反对；或者把参加过群众性的民族报复事件的人一律列为不准入党。还有不少干部把少数民族应有的民族感情，同狭隘的民族主义思想混淆起来，认为是落后的表现。这些思想障碍都影响了边疆建党工作的正常发展。有的县份半年只发展了两个党员，有的自治州直属机关甚至半年没有发展一个少数民族党员。
    经过这次座谈会的讨论，到会干部认识到了在边疆民族地区积极进行建党工作，培养具有共产主义觉悟的民族干部，是完成中共云南省第一次代表大会所确定的当前党在民族工作方面的根本任务的核心问题。大家认为，由于边疆地区民族众多，各民族政治、经济、文化的发展很不平衡，这些地区的建党工作就既要坚持党的原则，又要照顾民族的特点。在少数民族地区进行建党工作所采取的方式，不仅应与汉族地区有所不同，而且在各少数民族之间，甚至一个民族内部的不同支系之间，也不能采取完全相同的方式。经验证明，凡是能够具体分析各少数民族不同的历史条件，从实际情况出发，并对少数民族的积极分子进行积极而耐心的帮助和培养的，建党工作都取得了良好的成绩，如在佧佤族、傈僳族和苦聪族干部中已经因此发展了一批党员。相反地，有些地区由于脱离了少数民族的实际情况，生搬硬套汉族地区的建党经验，结果，不仅使建党工作进展迟缓，还给少数民族积极分子带来了一些不必要的顾虑。
    座谈会上还详细地研究了对少数民族发展党员对象的培养教育问题，并对边疆少数民族地区建党工作中的若干特殊问题作了一些具体规定。
