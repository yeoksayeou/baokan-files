Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, September 9th. People from all walks of life in Assam Province, India, are united in opposing the plan of British oil companies to establish an oil refinery in Calcutta to refine oil produced in Assam Province.

The British-run Assam Oil Company has suggested building a refinery in Calcutta, West Bengal, and then connecting the refinery to the Digboi oil field in Assam with a 900-mile pipeline.

The people of Assam strongly oppose this proposal, demanding that the refinery be built within the province where oil can be developed locally.

On August 11th, the largest student demonstration ever occurred throughout Assam, with no less than 200,000 students and residents participating in the demonstration march. On August 28th, demonstrations and parades were held in various towns and cities in Assam, with schools and shops closing their doors and traffic on the streets coming to a standstill.

    反对英国在加尔各答设厂炼油
    印度阿萨姆各界示威
    据新华社新德里9日电　印度阿萨姆省各阶层人民一致反对英国的石油公司在加尔各答设立炼油厂来提炼阿萨姆省出产的石油的计划。
    英国人办的阿萨姆石油公司建议在西孟加拉省的加尔各答建立炼油厂，然后再用一条九百英里长的输油管把炼油厂同阿萨姆的迪格鲍伊油田连接起来。
    阿萨姆人民强烈反对这个建议，他们要求炼油厂应该建立在能就地开发石油的省内。
    阿萨姆全省各地曾经在8月11日发生了最大规模的一次学生示威，参加示威游行的学生和居民不下二十万人。8月28日，阿萨姆的各个市镇举行了示威游行，学校、商店都关起大门，街上交通停顿。
