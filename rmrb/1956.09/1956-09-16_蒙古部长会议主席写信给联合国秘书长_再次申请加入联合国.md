Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, 15th -- Tsedenbal, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Mongolian People's Republic, telegraphed UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld on September 14, re-applying for the admission of the Mongolian People's Republic to the United Nations, and requested that Mongolia's application be submitted to the upcoming Eleventh Session of the United Nations General Assembly. The full text is as follows:

To His Excellency Mr. Hammarskjöld, Secretary-General of the United Nations, New York:

As the world knows, the Government of the Mongolian People's Republic fully supports the purposes and principles of the United Nations, and believes that this international organization is of great importance in safeguarding universal peace and the security of peoples, as well as in the cause of friendly cooperation among all countries. Shortly after the establishment of the United Nations, as early as 1946, the Mongolian People's Republic applied to join the United Nations together with those countries that first applied for membership. Since then, our government has repeatedly reiterated its application.

However, due to the opposition and discriminatory policies of certain groups of individual countries, the Mongolian People's Republic remains outside the United Nations to this day. As everyone knows, our nation is one of the oldest nations in the world, and our country has a long history. It is also well known that the Mongolian People's Republic, as a sovereign democratic state, has pursued a peaceful foreign policy from the very beginning of its establishment. One of the striking evidences of this is that the Mongolian People's Republic made its contribution to the Allied struggle against Nazi Germany and to the cause of establishing peace in the Far East during the last World War. Now, the Mongolian People's Republic is developing its international contacts and cooperation in international affairs more extensively in accordance with the purposes and principles of the United Nations, and fully supports the principle of coexistence of countries with different socio-economic systems.

From the foregoing, it is clear that the Mongolian People's Republic fully meets the requirements of the United Nations Charter and has every right to become a member state. The vast majority of United Nations member states do not deny the right of the Mongolian People's Republic to become a member of the United Nations. This is evidenced by the fact that representatives of fifty-two member states in this organization voted in favor of admitting the Mongolian People's Republic to the United Nations at the Tenth Session of the United Nations General Assembly.

From all the above, it seems that the reasons put forward by individual representatives in the United Nations for opposing the admission of the Mongolian People's Republic to the United Nations are unfounded and even more incomprehensible to the Mongolian people and their government.

The Government of the Mongolian People's Republic is convinced that its rights are just and legitimate and now re-applies for the admission of the Mongolian People's Republic to the United Nations.

Therefore, I have the honor to request you, Mr. Secretary-General, to submit the application of the Mongolian People's Republic requesting its admission to the United Nations to the upcoming Eleventh Session of the United Nations General Assembly and to notify all member states of the United Nations of this application.

The Government of the Mongolian People's Republic reiterates that the Mongolian People's Republic is willing to assume all the obligations of the United Nations Charter and will strictly fulfill these obligations in the future.

The Government of the Mongolian People's Republic also requests you, Mr. Secretary-General, to assist in resolving the issue of the attendance of the representatives of the Mongolian People's Republic at the Eleventh Session of the United Nations General Assembly, so that we can send representatives to attend the Assembly before it begins.

With highest consideration,
Tsedenbal
Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Mongolian People's Republic
Ulaanbaatar, September 14, 1956

    蒙古部长会议主席写信给联合国秘书长
    再次申请加入联合国
    新华社15日讯　乌兰巴托消息：蒙古人民共和国部长会议主席泽登巴尔在9月14日打电报给联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德，再次申请接纳蒙古人民共和国为联合国会员国，并且要求把蒙古的申请书提交给即将举行的联合国大会第十一届会议。全文如下：纽约联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德先生阁下
    举世皆知，蒙古人民共和国政府完全拥护联合国的宗旨和原则，认为这个国际组织在保障普遍和平和人民安全以及在各国友好合作的事业中有非常重要的意义。在联合国成立后不久，早在1946年，蒙古人民共和国就已经同那些首批申请加入联合国的国家一起申请加入联合国。此后，我国政府又一再重申自己的申请。
    但是，由于个别国家的某些集团的反对和歧视政策，蒙古人民共和国至今还留在联合国之外。大家知道，我国民族是世界上古老的民族之一，我们的国家有悠久的历史。人们也都知道，蒙古人民共和国作为一个主权的民主国家，自成立之初起就奉行着爱好和平的外交政策。这一方面的显著证据之一就是，蒙古人民共和国在上一次世界大战期间对盟国反纳粹德国的斗争和树立远东和平的事业做出了自己的贡献。现在，蒙古人民共和国按照联合国的宗旨和原则更广泛地发展自己同其他国家的国际联系和事务合作，充分支持不同社会经济制度的国家共处的原则。
    由上所述显然可见，蒙古人民共和国完全符合联合国宪章的要求，有充分的权利成为它的会员国。联合国绝大多数会员国都不否认蒙古人民共和国成为联合国会员国的权利。在这个组织中，有五十二个会员国的代表在联合国大会第十届会议上投票赞成接纳蒙古人民共和国加入联合国。这一事实，就证明了这一点。
    从上述一切看来，联合国中个别代表提出反对接纳蒙古人民共和国加入联合国的理由是毫无根据的，对蒙古人民及其政府说来就更加不可理解了。
    蒙古人民共和国政府确信自己的权利是正当的、是合法的，现在再次申请接纳蒙古人民共和国为联合国会员国。
    因此，我荣幸地请求您，秘书长先生，把蒙古人民共和国要求接纳它为联合国会员国的申请书提交给即将举行的联合国大会第十一届会议，并且将本申请通知给联合国各会员国。
    蒙古人民共和国政府再次声明，蒙古人民共和国愿意承担联合国宪章的一切义务，今后将严格履行这些义务。
    蒙古人民共和国政府还请求您，秘书长先生，协助解决关于蒙古人民共和国代表出席联合国大会第十一届会议的问题，以便我们能够在大会开始前派代表出席大会。
        此致敬礼
    蒙古人民共和国部长会议主席
            泽登巴尔
    1956年9月14日乌兰巴托
