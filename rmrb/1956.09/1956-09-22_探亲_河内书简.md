Visiting Relatives
—Hanoi Letters
Yuan Ying

    A female comrade, about to take up a teaching position in Vietnam, came to the aisle of the train carriage and, looking out of the window at the lush mountains on both sides of the iron track, asked:
    "Are we almost at Friendship Pass?"
    Everyone couldn't help but laugh. Our train had been speeding across the land of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam for nearly ten minutes already.

    I tell you this story right at the beginning, and you will know that this is by no means a slight to that female comrade. I just want to use this to explain: the mountains and rivers of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam are so similar to China, especially the peaks of the northern Vietnamese mountains, which are so much like the mountains along the Guilin and Liuzhou roads.

    We came from Beijing to Hanoi. But why, after traveling thousands of kilometers south, do we feel no sense of being in a foreign land? Of course, this cannot be explained solely by the scenery.

    The day we arrived in Hanoi was the eve of the National Day of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. In the evening, we drove around Hanoi, and when we reached Hoan Kiem Lake, we saw people of all ages strolling along the streets with their families; shoulder to shoulder, bustling with activity. The streets were full of red flags and laughter. Immediately, we felt as if we were immersed in the joyous atmosphere of Beijing or Guangzhou on the eve of National Day. This is absolutely true; that was exactly how we felt at the time. This feeling swept away some of the nervousness caused by just getting off the train and being taken to a very beautiful guest house.

    How could this be a strange city, a strange country? No, not at all. From the moment we left Beijing, our mood was like visiting a close relative living in a neighboring county—or, you might say, a direct sibling. We had never been to Hanoi, but we were so familiar with Long Bien Bridge and Hoan Kiem Lake, just as we had already learned about the scenery of the neighboring county from our brother's letters.

    However, the main point is more than just this.

    The Vietnamese comrades' meticulous and thoughtful care and hospitality deepened our feeling of visiting relatives. One of our fellow painters, because of the heat, ate a little less rice. The next day, the doctor came and even planned to visit us every day; we thought of going out to stroll the streets, but the Vietnamese comrades advised us to rest, because we were going to see the performance of Ukrainian dancers in the evening, and they were afraid that we would be tired from walking; Vietnamese comrades are accustomed to the subtropical climate, and since it is now the last month of summer, they had long since stopped using fans, but we were inseparable from our fans. When they saw that we forgot to bring our fans when we went out, they specially reminded us; before we officially visited the Vietnamese Literary and Art Association and attended the banquet, they repeatedly said that we did not have to wear suits or ties, because we were not yet accustomed to the weather. In fact, after a few days, we had already gotten used to it.

    At home, we often talk about the words "brotherly friendship." Only when you are there, and specifically discern its taste in all aspects of work and life, will you deeply understand its true meaning.
              September 6, Hanoi

    探亲
    ——河内书简
    袁鹰
    一位要到越南去担任教师工作的女同志走到车厢的甬道上来，从窗子里望望铁树两旁的葱郁的高山，问道：
    “睦南关快到了没有？”
    大家不觉笑起来。我们的火车，奔驰在越南民主共和国的土地上，实在已经快有十分钟之久了。
    我一开头就告诉你这一件事，你会知道这决不是对那位女同志有丝毫的不尊敬。我只是想借此说明白：越南民主共和国的山川风物，同中国是那么地相似，特别是越北的山地的峰峦，是那么酷似桂林、柳州道上的群山。
    我们是从北京到河内来的。但是，为什么南行数千公里，却毫没有去国离乡的陌生之感？这自然不能仅从山川景物上去找原因的。
    到河内的那天，正是越南民主共和国国庆的前夕。晚上，我们驱车游河内市区，一到还剑湖边，只见人们扶老携幼，徜徉街头；摩肩接踵，熙熙攘攘。满街的红旗，满街的欢笑。立刻，我们仿佛投身于北京或广州在国庆节前夕的欢乐的海洋里了。这完全是实话，我们当时的的确确就是这个感觉。这种感觉，使我们由于刚下火车并且被接待到一个十分漂亮的招待所而造成的一些紧张的心情，为之一扫而空。
    这哪里是到一个陌生的城市，陌生的国家呢？不，完全不是的。我们的心情，从离开北京的时候起，就像去探望一位住在邻县的近亲——或者说，就是一位嫡亲兄弟。我们没有到过河内，可是我们是那么熟悉龙边桥和还剑湖，就像我们早已从兄弟的信里知道邻县的景物一样。
    然而，主要的还不止此。
    越南同志的无微不至、体贴入微的关怀和接待，加深了我们的这种探亲的心情。我们同行的一位画家，因为天气热，少吃了一点饭，第二天，医生就来了，他甚至打算每天来看我们一次；我们想到大街上去逛逛，越南同志却劝我们休息，因为晚上要看乌克兰舞蹈家的表演，怕我们逛街会累；越南同志习惯于亚热带的气候，并且现在已是夏季的最后一个月，因而他们都早不用扇子，可是我们却是扇不离手，他们看见我们出门忘了带扇子，便特为关照一声；当我们去正式访问越南文艺协会和赴宴以前，他们再三致意，说可以不穿上装，不结领带，因为我们对天气还不习惯。——其实，我们来了几天，也已经习惯了。
    在国内的时候，我们经常说到“兄弟般的友谊”这个字眼。只有当你身临其境、从工作和生活的一切方面具体地辨别了它的滋味的时候，你才会深刻地理解它的真谛。
              9月6日，河内
