Xinhua News Agency, 1st. Comrade Deng Xiaoping, member of the Political Bureau and Secretary-General of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, made the following statement to Xinhua News Agency reporters on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China regarding the West German authorities' anti-peace and anti-democratic atrocities of persecuting the German Communist Party:

    The West German authorities dared to violate the will of the German people, ignoring the opposition of just world opinion, declared the German Communist Party illegal on August 17, 1956, and from that day on, intensified the persecution of German Communists, while at the same time destroying other democratic groups and progressive organizations in West Germany. This is a Hitler-style reactionary act and a fascist atrocity. This atrocity has aroused profound anger among the Chinese people, and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, on behalf of the Chinese people, lodges a strong protest with the West German authorities.

    This move by the West German authorities to persecute German Communists is not accidental. Since the end of World War II, West Germany has increasingly become a military base for international war forces to prepare for new wars. They have adopted a policy of actively restoring militarist forces in West Germany, obstructing the German people from realizing national unification on a peaceful and democratic basis, and organizing military blocs involving West Germany that threaten European security. The international tension in the post-war period, as far as the European region is concerned, has been caused by this kind of war preparation policy characterized by arming West Germany, splitting Germany, and turning West Germany into a military base. However, this policy violates the national interests of the German people and harms the peace and security interests of the people of Europe and the world. As a result, it is increasingly opposed and resisted by the German people, the European people, and even the people of the world. With the trend of easing international tensions over the past year, the German people's struggle to stop militarist forces, oppose participation in military blocs, and support the peaceful unification of the country on a democratic basis has grown sharply. In this situation, the Adenauer reactionary clique has recklessly adopted measures to intensify the suppression of the German Communist Party in an attempt to suppress the democratic forces of the German people, deepen the division of the German nation, strengthen the West German militarist forces, and thereby lead to the escalation of international tensions. It is obvious that this move by the West German reactionary authorities to persecute the German Communist Party is not only an extremely brutal trampling on the basic democratic rights of the German people, but also an extremely vicious attack on the cause of peace of the people of the world.

    The Chinese people and the Chinese Communist Party are watching with great concern the struggle that the German people and the German Communist Party are waging. They are heroically resisting this anti-peace and anti-democratic offensive by the West German reactionary forces. The Chinese people and the Chinese Communist Party express warm sympathy and support to the German people and the German Communist Party. They are by no means isolated. Standing with them are the entire socialist camp, the people of all oppressed nations who are engaged in anti-colonialist struggles, and all peace-loving people throughout the world who cherish the cause of human progress and justice and do not want to suffer another fascist disaster.

    The Chinese people believe that the German people will surely be able to achieve final victory in the struggle to prevent Germany from embarking on the road of fascism and war, in the struggle to realize the unification of the German nation on a democratic basis, and to safeguard peace and security in Europe and the world.

    中共中央抗议西德当局迫害德共的暴行
    新华社1日讯　中国共产党中央委员会政治局委员兼秘书长邓小平，就西德当局迫害德国共产党的反和平反民主的暴行，代表中国共产党中央委员会对新华社记者发表谈话如下：
    西德当局竟敢违背德国人民的意志，不顾世界正义舆论的反对，在1956年8月17日宣布德国共产党为非法，并且从这一天开始，加紧迫害德国共产党人，同时摧残西德其他民主团体和进步组织，这是一种希特勒式的反动行为和法西斯暴行。这种暴行已在中国人民中引起了深刻的愤怒，中国共产党中央委员会代表中国人民对西德当局提出强烈的抗议。
    西德当局这个迫害德国共产党人的举动，不是偶然的。第二次世界大战结束以后，西德就日益变成国际战争势力准备新战争的军事基地。他们采取了在西德积极恢复军国主义势力、阻挠德国人民在和平民主基础上实现国家的统一、组织有西德参加的威胁欧洲安全的军事集团的政策。战后时期的国际紧张局势，就欧洲地区来说，就是由这样一种以武装西德、分裂德国、变西德为军事基地为特点的备战政策引起来的。但是，这一政策是违反德国人民的民族利益的，也是损害欧洲和全世界各国人民的和平和安全的利益的，因而日益受到德国人民、欧洲人民以至全世界人民的反对和抵抗。随着一年来国际紧张局势的趋向缓和，德国人民要求制止军国主义势力、反对参加军事集团、拥护在民主基础上实现国家的和平统一的斗争，有了急剧的增长。在这种情况下，阿登纳反动集团就不顾一切地采取加紧迫害德国共产党的措施，以图压制德国人民的民主力量，加深德国民族的分裂，加强西德军国主义势力，并且由此导致国际紧张局势的加剧。显而易见，西德反动当局这个迫害德国共产党的举动，不仅是对于德国人民基本民主权利的一次极其粗暴的蹂躏，而且是对于全世界人民争取和平事业的一次极其凶恶的进攻。
    中国人民和中国共产党以极大的关怀注视着德国人民和德国共产党正在进行的斗争。他们对于西德反动势力的这次反和平反民主的进攻，正在进行英勇的抵抗。中国人民和中国共产党对于德国人民和德国共产党表示热烈的同情和支持。他们决不是孤立的，同他们站在一起的，有整个社会主义阵营，有正在进行反殖民主义斗争的各被压迫民族的人民，有一切爱好和平的、珍视人类进步和正义事业的、不愿再一次遭受法西斯灾难的全世界广大人民。
    中国人民相信，德国人民一定能够在制止德国走上法西斯主义和战争的道路的斗争中，在民主基础上实现德国民族的统一、保障欧洲和全世界的和平和安全的斗争中，取得最后的胜利。
