Xinhua News Agency, September 5th Dispatch from Cairo: Syrian Ambassador to Egypt, Azam, in a statement on behalf of the Syrian government, criticized the Anglo-French military buildup in the Mediterranean.

He said: France should have “learned a lesson” from its experiences in Syria, Indochina, and Algeria. He reminded Britain to remember its withdrawal from India, Burma, Egypt, and Sudan. He further said, "Tomorrow it will be Cyprus' turn."

Azam said that Arab countries have no ambition other than to fully exercise sovereignty over their territories and cooperate peacefully with other countries. He said that Western countries "must now decide whether they want friendship and peace or hostility, and it knows that the price of hostility is high."

Xinhua News Agency, September 5th Dispatch from New York: Syria's representative to the United Nations, Yasha, protested on September 4th that the "buildup" of British and French forces in Cyprus is a threat to the independence of Arab countries.

Yasha said in a statement: "The assembly of these troops before and during the negotiations in Cairo cannot but remind one of the typical policies of colonial powers in the nineteenth century. This outdated policy of intimidation will certainly not contribute to a just and peaceful solution to the Suez Canal issue."

Xinhua News Agency, September 5th Dispatch from Cairo: The Arab League headquarters in Cairo announced on September 4th that King Mohammed Zahir Shah of Afghanistan declared his country's support for Egypt on the Suez Canal issue.

The Arab League Secretariat said that the Afghan King's decision was conveyed by the Afghan Ambassador to Cairo. The ambassador said that the King believes that the Suez Canal belongs entirely to Egypt and believes that "no foreign control over the canal should be established."

Xinhua News Agency, September 5th Dispatch from Cairo: Sudanese Foreign Minister Mohammed Ahmed Magoub said in Cairo on September 3rd that Sudan will always stand by Egypt.

    叙利亚阿富汗等国支持埃及斗争
    反对英法对埃及进行军事威胁
    苏丹外长说苏丹永远站在埃及一边
    据新华社5日讯　开罗消息：叙利亚驻埃及大使阿札姆在代表叙利亚政府发表的一项声明中，抨击英法两国在地中海地区的军事集结。
    他说：法国应当已经从它在叙利亚、印度支那和阿尔及利亚的经验中“吸取了教训”。他提醒英国记住它从印度、缅甸、埃及和苏丹领土的撤退。他又说，“明天该轮到塞浦路斯了”。
    阿札姆说，阿拉伯国家除了在它们的领土上充分行使主权并且同其他国家和平合作之外没有野心。他说，西方国家“现在必须决定是要友好和平呢还是敌对，它是知道敌对的代价是昂贵的”。
    据新华社5日讯　纽约消息：叙利亚驻联合国的代表亚沙9月4日抗议说，英国和法国军队在塞浦路斯的“集结”是对阿拉伯国家的独立的威胁。
    亚沙在声明里说：“在谈判在开罗开始以前和正在谈判的期间集结这些军队，不禁使人回想起殖民国家在十九世纪的典型政策。这种过时的恫吓政策绝不会有助于公正和和平地解决苏彝士运河问题。”
    新华社5日讯　开罗消息：设在开罗的阿拉伯联盟总部9月4日宣布，阿富汗国王穆罕默德·查希尔·沙阿宣布他的国家在苏彝士运河问题上支持埃及。
    阿拉伯联盟秘书处说，阿富汗国王的决定是由驻开罗的阿富汗大使转达的。这位大使说，国王认为苏彝士运河完全是属于埃及的，并且认为“不得建立外国对运河的任何控制”。
    新华社5日讯　开罗消息：苏丹外交部长穆罕默德·艾哈迈德·马古布9月3日在开罗说，苏丹将永远站在埃及这一边。
    马古布说，他奉他的政府之命留在开罗密切注意埃及总统纳赛尔和“五国委员会”的会谈情况。
    马古布曾同埃及外交部长法齐会晤，就政治局势交换了意见。
