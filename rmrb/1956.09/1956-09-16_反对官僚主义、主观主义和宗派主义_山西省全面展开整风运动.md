Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 15th: (Xinhua News Agency reporter Feng Jianshu reports:) A rectification movement focusing on opposing the bureaucratic and subjectivist work styles of leading cadres at all levels is being fully launched in Shanxi Province. At present, the movement is progressing rapidly in some areas, having expanded from county-level leading organs to villages and agricultural cooperatives, and has been embraced by the broad masses of lower-level cadres and peasants. Intra-Party democratic life is also becoming increasingly active with the development of the movement, and improvements are beginning to appear in rural work.

    The rectification movement in various localities focuses on opposing bureaucratism, subjectivism, and sectarianism in county-level leading departments and improving the Party's leadership style. The rectification process emphasizes linking with reality, connecting with the masses, and conducting bottom-up inspection and criticism. Before the start of the rectification, lower-level cadres and the masses are generally given ample time to study documents and understand the principles and significance of the rectification. Leading cadres also first examine their feelings of arrogance and complacency and correct their learning attitudes to create conditions for broadly promoting democracy and carrying out criticism. After the start of the rectification, leading cadres humbly listen to the criticisms of the masses, earnestly improve their leadership style and work systems based on the opinions put forward by everyone, and promptly address existing pressing issues. County-level leading departments in JingLe County have also decided to set up full-time cadres during the rectification period to be responsible for receiving the masses, listening to criticisms and suggestions from the lower levels, and promptly analyzing and organizing these criticisms and suggestions for reference by relevant departments during the rectification. After adopting these methods, the county quickly identified the subjectivist error of blindly expanding high-yield crops, which could reduce the county's autumn grain production by more than 300,000 catties, and fifty-one relatively serious incidents of coercion and commandism.

    Various localities have also adopted methods such as convening enlarged cadre meetings, symposiums, training courses, or sending responsible cadres to the countryside to lead the rectification movement organized by the county Party committee. The Changzi County Party Committee invited twenty-six labor models from the county to a symposium, and they put forward a total of fifty-three important criticisms and suggestions to the county-level leading organs. In the first half of this year, the county-level leading organs in Lu'an County held as many as fifty-nine large-scale meetings, with an average of five hundred and thirty-three township and cooperative cadres attending meetings in the county every day. The Lu'an County Party Committee and the County People's Committee issued a total of one thousand one hundred and thirteen kinds of instructions, circulars, and forms. The Lu'an County Party Committee recently convened an enlarged cadre meeting in the county to conduct inspections, and quickly corrected the above shortcomings. The county-level leading organs also organized mountain area visiting teams to immediately investigate the Taiyi, Chongyang and other mountain areas. The broad masses of township and cooperative cadres have also raised their political awareness and automatically inspected and improved their work styles. In the past, only the directors of four cooperatives, including Yaogou and Xiba, had gone to the fields in the ten agricultural cooperatives of Bayi Township. After inspection, eight cooperative directors have now gone to the fields.

    The rectification movement in various localities is being carried out based on the resolutions of the First Congress of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China in August.

    Before the rectification, all localities made good arrangements for the central tasks, strengthened investigation and research on various practical tasks during the rectification, and paid attention to promoting democracy, thereby further consolidating the results of the rectification.

    反对官僚主义、主观主义和宗派主义
    山西省全面展开整风运动
    新华社太原15日电　新华社记者冯建书报道：以反对各级领导干部的官僚主义、主观主义作风为主要内容的整风运动，正在山西省各地全面展开。目前，运动进展较快的地区已经由县级领导机关发展到乡村和农业社，受到广大下层干部和农民群众的拥护。党内民主生活也随着运动的发展而日趋活跃，农村工作开始出现改进的现象。
    各地整风运动都以反对县级领导部门的官僚主义、主观主义和宗派主义，改进党的领导作风为重点。整风过程中注意联系实际、联系群众，进行自下而上的检查和批判。在整风开始以前，一般都让广大下层干部和群众以充分的时间学习文件，领会这次整风的原则和意义，领导干部还先检查了骄傲自满情绪，端正学习态度，为广泛地发扬民主和开展批评创造了条件。整风开始以后，领导干部虚心地听取群众的批评，根据大家提出的意见切实改进领导作风和工作制度，并且及时处理现有的迫切问题。静乐县县级各领导部门还决定在整风期间设专职干部负责接待群众，听取来自下层的批评建议，并将这些批评建议及时分析整理后交有关部门在整风时作参考。这个县采用这些办法后，很快就检查出盲目扩展高产作物，使全县秋田可能减产三十多万斤粮食的主观主义错误和五十一起较严重的强迫命令事件。
    各地还采取了由中共县委会召开扩大干部会、座谈会、训练班或派负责干部下乡领导等办法，来开展整风运动。中共长子县委会曾邀集本县二十六位劳动模范座谈，结果他们在会上共对县级领导机关提出了五十三条重要的批评和建议。潞安县县级领导机关在今年上半年仅召开大型会议就有五十九次，每天平均有五百三十三个乡、社干部在县上开会。中共潞安县委会和县人民委员会两个单位发出的指示、通报和表格共有一千一百一十三种之多。潞安县委最近召开了全县扩大干部会来进行检查，很快就纠正了上述缺点。县级领导机关还组织了山区访问队，立即到太义、重阳等山区考察。广大乡、社干部也提高了政治觉悟，自动检查和改进工作作风。八义乡十个农业社过去只有窑沟、西八等四个社主任下过地，经过检查以后，已经有八个社主任到了田间。
    各地的整风运动是根据8月份中共山西省第一次代表大会的决议进行的。
    在整风前各地都把中心工作作了很好的安排，整风中对各项实际工作加强了调查研究，并且注意发扬民主，因而进一步巩固了整风的成果。
