    Beijing's Department Store, Clothing, Watches and Eyeglasses, Knitwear and Cotton Fabrics, and Sugar and Pastry Companies have made early preparations for the fourth quarter's supply of goods. They have signed purchase contracts worth more than 10 million yuan. These include daily necessities such as woollen underwear, yarn, sweaters, scarves, headscarves, leather shoes, rubber shoes, leather jackets, leather gloves, blankets, and thermos bottles, as well as Tianjin Qishilin's candies and newly produced children's toys from Guangzhou.
    Wangfujing Department Store also sent people to Qinghai, Yinchuan and other places to purchase fur and other winter goods.
    In order to ensure that the organized goods meet the requirements of Beijing citizens, most of the personnel who went to purchase goods from other places this time were business-savvy salespersons. Beijing Department Store specially transferred more than a dozen salespersons from the retail department to participate in the procurement work. (Ye)
