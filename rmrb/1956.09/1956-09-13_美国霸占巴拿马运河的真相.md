The Truth About the US Seizure of the Panama Canal
Lin Longtie

Speaking of the Suez Canal, people naturally think of the Panama Canal. These two internationally renowned sister canals have both had a period of painful experience full of the blood and tears of the people. Today, the people of the countries where they are located are launching struggles against the colonialists to safeguard their national rights.

An Important International Waterway

Opening a map of the Americas, you can see that in the narrow isthmus region of the Republic of Panama in the southern end of Central America, the Panama Canal runs from Balboa Port in the Bay of Panama in the south to Cristobal Port in the Caribbean Sea in the north, connecting the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. The canal is 81.3 kilometers long and 91 to 304 meters wide. It takes ordinary ships only seven or eight hours to pass through. Currently, 35 countries use this waterway, with an average of about 23 ships passing through each day, and an annual cargo volume of about 51 million tons. Since the canal opened, ships no longer need to detour around the Strait of Magellan at the southern tip of South America, greatly shortening the voyage distance between the two oceans. It is an international shipping waterway whose importance is second only to the Suez Canal.

The United States Seizes the Canal as Its Own

Like the situation with the Suez Canal before, although the Panama Canal is located in Panamanian territory, the canal has not become the property of the Panamanian people; it has been seized by the United States. In addition to receiving meager rent each year, Panama has absolutely no right to intervene in the canal. Panama's opposition to US control of the canal is not a new issue. It has had long-term negotiations with the United States regarding canal rights, but without result. After the Suez Canal issue occurred, it caused the Panamanian people and government to be even more concerned about the rights to this canal. In early August, the Panamanian government formally protested its lack of invitation to participate in the London conference discussing the Suez Canal, and emphasized that the results of the London conference were "particularly important" to Panama, because the Panama Canal and the Suez Canal have fundamental similarities. Therefore, as American news agencies pointed out, the US government is particularly "sensitive" to this issue, that is, feeling guilty. Dulles once stated that in the Suez Canal issue, he wanted to avoid any solutions that would endanger the United States' privileged position in the Panama Canal, which precisely demonstrates this point. In order to prevent Panama from following in Egypt's footsteps and demanding that the United States restore its sovereignty over the canal, the United States has widely publicized the differences in the legal status of the two canals. Dulles issued a statement at a press conference on August 28, saying that according to the 1903 "US-Panama Treaty," the United States possesses complete rights to exercise "sovereignty" in the Canal Zone, while the Republic of Panama "shall absolutely not exercise any such sovereignty, power, or authority." The Panamanian government lodged a serious protest against this blatant statement disregarding the Panamanian nation. However, the US government still flatly denied that Panama had any sovereign relationship over the canal, and emphasized that the United States possessed the legal standing to permanently and absolutely control the Panama Canal. But, what exactly is the "US-Panama Treaty" that supposedly granted this "legal standing" to the United States?

Colonialist Robbery Tactics

Anyone who has read history knows how the United States obtained its "sovereignty" over the Panama Canal. Panama was originally a province of Colombia, and it was established as a country in the process of the United States seizing the right to dig the canal. The "US-Panama Treaty" used by Dulles to defend the United States' occupation of the Panama Canal is merely a historical record of the predatory actions of US imperialism.

As early as the last century, the United States intended to dig a canal in Central America in order to expand its influence into Central and South America, but because its power was still developing, it had to sign the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty with Britain, which was then still known as the maritime hegemon, in 1850, stipulating that the two countries should jointly manage the construction of a canal in Central America in the future. After the Spanish-American War in 1898, the United States became a newly emerging and powerful imperialist country. In 1901, it forced Britain to re-sign the Hay-Pauncefote Treaty, and Britain recognized that the United States alone had the right to dig and control the canal in Central America, but the treaty stipulated that ships of all countries should be allowed to pass freely. Before this, the French Panama Canal Company had already obtained the consent of the Colombian government and started construction of the canal in 1881, but due to technical difficulties, shortage of funds, and the prevalence of yellow fever, the project was halted in 1889. Later, although the New Panama Company was re-established, the United States tried every possible means to obstruct it, and finally acquired all of the company's assets and canal excavation rights for 40 million US dollars.

After the United States defeated the competition from Britain and France, it made unreasonable demands on the Colombian government in early 1903 for a long-term lease of part of the land in the Panama Isthmus. After being rejected by the Colombian government, it created a "revolution" in Panama, and the Marines on American warships, which had been dispatched to the Panama coast in advance, took the opportunity to land and prevent Colombian military action. The Republic of Panama declared its independence from Colombia. The United States quickly recognized Panama's independence, and immediately signed the "US-Panama Treaty" with the newly established Panamanian government under its protection. The unequal nature of this treaty is very obvious. According to this treaty, the United States obtained the right to lease a narrow area of 16.1 kilometers wide at the price of a lump sum payment of 10 million US dollars and a subsequent annual rent of 250,000 US dollars. It was this treaty that stipulated that the United States had the right to permanently occupy, use, and control the Canal Zone, and also had the right to station troops and build fortifications in the Canal Zone.

In 1904, canal construction restarted, and a large number of canal workers died from yellow fever and malaria. This canal, built on the white bones of the Panamanian people, was finally completed in 1914. The United States spent only 366,665,000 US dollars on excavation costs.

A Tool for Plundering the Panamanian People

The Canal Zone is managed by an American governor appointed by the US Department of Defense, who holds the three positions of military, political, and business affairs. The Panama Canal Company not only monopolized the transportation in the zone, but also controlled the Panama Railway from Panama City on the Pacific coast to Colon on the Caribbean coast. The United States also used the duty-free treatment of goods in the Canal Zone to attack Panama's national industry and commerce, and implemented a racially discriminatory wage policy in the Canal Zone, carrying out particularly cruel exploitation of Panamanian workers. Through the control of the Panama Canal, the United States directly interfered in Panama's internal affairs. In Panamanian history, when Panamanian rulers could not satisfy American wishes, the United States would create coups and replace them with more agreeable figures. At the same time, American economic forces comprehensively penetrated Panama. According to figures published in the US Department of Commerce's "Business Conditions" magazine, in 1954, American investment in Panama reached 433 million US dollars, and the profits plundered from 1950 to 1954 alone amounted to 332 million US dollars.

The Panama Canal has not brought benefits to the Panamanian people, but has become a tool for the United States to exploit and enslave the Panamanian people.

A Base for Military Expansion

The "New York Times" undisguisedly said on August 10 that the Panama Canal has important strategic significance for the United States. Since the canal was opened, it has facilitated the mobilization of the US two-ocean fleet. Historically, this canal has played a major role when the United States carried out military and economic expansion into Central and South America and Far Eastern countries. Defending the canal has also frequently become an excuse for the United States to take aggressive military action. Balboa Port and Cristobal Port at both ends of the canal have been occupied by the United States as naval bases. Currently, there are 25,000 American troops stationed in the Canal Zone.

When Egypt recovered the Suez Canal Company and effectively guaranteed the navigation of the canal, Dulles insisted that Egypt's exercise of its sovereignty over the canal would make the interests of other countries unguaranteed; but on the Panama Canal issue, he wanted to make people believe that the United States' holding of the canal would not cause any country to suffer damage due to the United States' possible misuse or abuse of its rights in the Panama Canal. It is worth noting that neither the 1901 Anglo-American Treaty nor the 1903 "US-Panama Treaty" gave the guarantee of "free passage in wartime as in peacetime regardless of flag" as the Suez Canal Treaty did. In fact, during the two world wars, the United States had blocked the Panama Canal and used it as an important US military base. It can be seen that this international waterway is currently governed by an American governor and has become a US military base. This fact does not embody the principle of free navigation, but makes the canal a political and military tool in the hands of the United States.

The Panamanian People Demand the Restoration of Sovereignty

The Panamanian people have never recognized the "US-Panama Treaty" imposed on them. "Oppose US control of the Panama Canal!" "American troops get out!" These are the loud slogans of the Panamanian people for a long time.

Under the heroic struggle of the Panamanian people, in 1936, the United States was forced to revise the treaty, increasing the canal rent from 250,000 US dollars to 400,000 US dollars, recognizing Panama's full sovereignty outside the Canal Zone, and stipulating that the United States must obtain the consent of the Panamanian government to use land outside the canal. But during the Second World War, the United States borrowed more than 100 bases under the pretext of defending the canal, refused to return them after the war, and further demanded to lease Rio Hato on the Pacific coast for 99 years. Due to the fierce opposition of the Panamanian people, the United States had to return some of the bases. In 1955, the United States and Panama signed a new treaty again, further increasing the canal rent to 1.93 million US dollars, stipulating equal wages for American and Panamanian employees in the Canal Zone, but the treaty also stipulated that Panama must allow the United States to use 20,000 acres of land free of charge for military training and exercises. The new treaty not only failed to resolve the issue of canal sovereignty that the Panamanian people are most concerned about, but also failed to resolve the issue of military bases outside the canal. Now, Egypt's recovery of sovereignty over the Suez Canal provides an example for Panama, and the Panamanian people's calls for the recovery of sovereignty over the canal are also rising. Panamanian Foreign Minister Boyd sternly refuted Dulles's remarks about the United States possessing "sovereignty," and he emphasized that "the canal is built on Panamanian territory, and Panama has never given up its sovereignty over it."

The Panama Canal, under US military occupation, not only damages Panama's territorial sovereignty, but also does not conform to the principle of international free navigation. However, for strategic and economic interests, the United States declares that it will control it forever. At the same time, the United States, under the pretext of guaranteeing free navigation, resolutely advocates "international control" over the Suez Canal, so that imperialism can jointly divide and rule Egypt's sovereignty. The ugly face of the colonialists cannot be concealed by any flowery words. (Attached picture)

    美国霸占巴拿马运河的真相
    林龙铁
    提起苏彝士运河，人们很自然地就会联想起巴拿马运河。这两条闻名国际的姐妹运河，在历史上都曾经有过一段充满人民血泪的辛酸经历，今天，它们所在国家的人民都在向殖民主义者展开斗争，维护他们民族的权利。
    一条重要的国际水道
    翻开美洲地图，就可以看到，在中美洲南端地形狭长的巴拿马共和国中段蜂腰地区，巴拿马运河从南面巴拿马湾的巴尔菩亚港直达北面加勒比海的克利斯托巴尔港，沟通了太平洋和大西洋。这条运河全长八一·三公里，宽九一至三○四公尺，普通轮船通过只要七、八小时，目前有三十五个国家使用这条水道，平均每天约有二十三艘轮船通过，年运货量约五千一百万吨。自从运河通航后，来往轮船不必再绕道南美洲南端的麦哲伦海峡，它大大缩短了两洋航程距离，是一条其重要性仅次于苏彝士运河的国际航运水道。
    美国自充运河的主人
    和苏彝士运河以前的情形一样，巴拿马运河虽然在巴拿马领土上，但是运河并没有成为巴拿马人民的财产，它被美国霸占了。巴拿马除了每年得到微不足道的租金外，对运河完全无权过问。巴拿马反对美国控制运河，并不是新问题，它曾和美国关于运河权利进行长期的谈判，但都没有结果。苏彝士运河问题发生后，引起巴拿马人民和政府更加关切这条运河的权利。8月初，巴拿马政府因为没有被邀请参加讨论苏彝士运河的伦敦会议，曾正式提出抗议，并且着重指出伦敦会议的结果对巴拿马“特别重要”，因为巴拿马运河和苏彝士运河有基本类似之处。因此，正如美国通讯社所指出的，美国政府对这个问题特别“敏感”，也就是贼胆心虚。杜勒斯曾经表示，在苏彝士运河问题上，要避免足以危及美国在巴拿马运河的特权地位的任何解决办法，正说明了这一点。为了防止巴拿马步埃及后尘，向美国提出恢复它对运河的主权的要求，美国广泛宣传两条运河的法律地位的不同。杜勒斯在8月28日的记者招待会上发表声明说，根据1903年的“美巴条约”，美国在运河区拥有行使“主权”的完全权利，而巴拿马共和国“完全不得行使任何这样的主权、权力或权威”。巴拿马政府对这种粗暴地蔑视巴拿马国家的声明，提出了严正抗议。但是美国政府仍一口否定巴拿马对运河有任何主权关系，强调美国拥有永远绝对控制巴拿马运河的法律地位。但是，所谓给予了美国这种“法律地位”的“美巴条约”究竟是怎么一会事呢？
    殖民主义者的强盗手段
    凡是读过历史的人，都知道美国是怎样取得它对巴拿马运河的“主权”的。巴拿马原是哥伦比亚的一省，它是在美国攫取运河开凿权的过程中间才建立起来的国家。被杜勒斯用来为美国侵占巴拿马运河的事实辩护的“美巴条约”，只不过是美帝国主义强盗行径的一件历史记录。
    还在上一个世纪，美国就有意在中美洲开凿一条运河，以便向中南美扩张势力，不过由于羽毛未丰，不得不和当时还号称海上霸王的英国在1850年签订克莱依顿一布尔维拉条约，规定将来在中美开凿运河，应由两国共同管理。1898年美西战争后，美国成为新兴强大的帝国主义国家，1901年强迫英国重新签订海—潘斯福特条约，英国承认美国单独享有在中美开凿并控制运河的权利，但是条约规定准予各国船舰自由通行。早在这以前，法国的巴拿马运河公司就已经征得哥伦比亚政府同意，在1881年动工开凿运河，但由于技术困难，经费短绌以及黄热病流行，工程在1889年停顿。后来新巴拿马公司虽然再度成立，美国却千方百计加以阻挠，最后终以四千万美元收购了该公司全部财产和运河开凿权。
    美国既战胜了英法的竞争，便于1903年初，向哥伦比亚政府提出长期租借巴拿马海峡一部分土地的无理要求，在遭到哥伦比亚政府拒绝之后，就在巴拿马制造了一场“革命”，并预先派往巴拿马沿海的美国军舰上的陆战队乘机登陆，阻止哥伦比亚的军事行动。巴拿马共和国宣告脱离哥伦比亚而独立。美国迅速承认巴拿马独立，随即同在它庇护下新成立的巴拿马政府签订了“美巴条约”。这个条约的不平等性质是非常明显的。按照这个条约，美国以一次付清一千万美元和以后每年租金二十五万美元的代价，获得了横宽十六·一公里的狭长地区的租借权。就是这个条约规定美国在运河区享有永久占领、使用和控制的权利，并且在运河区还有权驻军和建筑防御工事。
    1904年，运河重新施工，大批挖河工人死于黄热病和疟疾，建筑在巴拿马人民白骨堆上的这条运河终于在1914年完工，美国仅用去了三亿六千六百六十五万美元开凿费。
    掠夺巴拿马人民的工具
    运河区由美国国防部任命身兼军、政、商三职的美国总督管理。巴拿马运河公司不仅垄断了区内的交通，并且还控制了从太平洋岸巴拿马城到加勒比海边科伦的巴拿马铁路。美国还利用了在运河区商品免费待遇进攻巴拿马民族工商业，并且在运河区实行种族歧视的工资政策，对巴拿马工人进行特别残酷的剥削。通过对巴拿马运河的控制，美国直接干预了巴拿马的内政。在巴拿马历史上，巴拿马统治者不能满足美国愿望时，美国就制造政变，换上更称它心的人物。同时，美国经济势力全面渗入了巴拿马，据美国商务部的“商业现况”杂志发表的数字，1954年美国在巴拿马投资达四亿三千三百万美元，仅从1950年到1954年中，掠夺到的利润就高达三亿三千二百万美元。
    巴拿马运河不但没有给巴拿马人民带来了好处，反而成为美国榨取和奴役巴拿马人民的工具。
    进行军事扩张的基地
    8月10日“纽约时报”不加掩饰地说，巴拿马运河对美国具有重要战略意义。自从运河打通后，它便利了美国两洋舰队的调动。从历史上看，美国向中南美和远东国家进行军事和经济扩张的时候，这条运河起了极大作用。保卫运河也经常成为美国采取侵略性军事行动的借口。运河两端的巴尔菩亚港和克里斯托巴尔港已被美国占领作为海军基地。目前驻在运河区的美军达二万五千人。
    当埃及收回苏彝士运河公司并且有效地保证了运河航行的时候，杜勒斯硬说，埃及行使它对运河的主权会使得其他国家的利益失去保证；可是在巴拿马运河问题上，他又要使人相信，美国霸持着运河不会使任何国家由于美国可能错用或滥用它在巴拿马运河的权利而遭到损害。值得注意的是，1901年的英美条约和1903年的“美巴条约”都没有像苏彝士运河条约那样给予“战时如在平时不分船旗可以自由通行”的保证。事实上在两次世界大战期间，美国都曾经封锁巴拿马运河，并将它作为美军重要基地。可见，这条国际水道目前由一位美国总督管制，成为美国的一个军事基地，这个事实不是体现自由通航的原则，而是使得运河成为美国手中的一项政治和军事的手段。
    巴拿马人民要求恢复主权
    巴拿马人民从不承认强加到他们身上的“美巴条约”。“反对美国控制巴拿马运河”！“美国军队滚出去”！这是巴拿马人民长期以来的响亮口号。
    在巴拿马人民英勇斗争下，1936年，美国被迫修改条约，将运河租金从二十五万美元增至四十万美元，承认巴拿马在运河区外的充分主权，并规定美国利用运河以外土地必须征求巴拿马政府同意。可是在第二次大战期间，美国又借口保卫运河，强借了一百多个基地，战后拒绝归还，并进一步要求租借太平洋岸的里奥哈托九十九年。由于巴拿马人民激烈反对，美国才不得不归还了部分基地。1955年美巴再度签订新条约，将运河租金再增至一百九十三万美元，规定运河区美巴雇员工资平等，但是条约又规定巴拿马必须准许美国无偿使用二万亩土地，作为军事训练和演习之用。新条约既没有解决巴拿马人民最迫切关心的运河主权问题，对运河以外军事基地问题同样也没有解决。现在，埃及收回苏彝士运河主权给巴拿马提供了榜样，巴拿马人民要求收回运河主权的呼声也日益高涨。巴拿马外长波伊德对杜勒斯关于美国拥有“主权”的谈话曾严加驳斥，他着重指出，“运河是建筑在巴拿马领土内，巴拿马从来没有放弃过对它的主权”。
    巴拿马运河在美国军事占领下，既损害了巴拿马的领土主权，又不符合国际自由通航原则，但是美国为了战略和经济利益，宣告要永远控制它。与此同时，美国却借口保证自由通航，坚决主张对苏彝士运河实行“国际管制”，以便帝国主义共同宰割埃及主权。殖民主义者的这种丑恶面貌，是任何花言巧语所掩饰不了的。（附图片）
