    Recalling a Historic Day in Egypt
    Liu Zhenkai

    Before President Nasser of Egypt announced the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company, the Chinese Youth Delegation had already been visiting Alexandria for two days. In those days, the Mediterranean Sea seemed calm and tranquil. Who could have imagined that a huge storm would arise from this peaceful coastal city of Alexandria, and that the surging waves would shake the British Isles and even reach the other side of the Atlantic?

    On July 26th, the delegation received an invitation to listen to an important speech by President Nasser that afternoon. For the Egyptian people, this day was already a day of great historical significance. Four years ago on this day, King Farouk was expelled. From then on, the Egyptian people ended the rule of the feudal dynasty and entered a new historical period.

    Egyptian friends specially chose this meaningful day to show us Farouk's palace in Alexandria and the pier where he boarded the ship when he was exiled four years ago. Egyptian friends said: Farouk's downfall was a great joy for the Egyptian people. And on the same day four years later, Nasser was to deliver a speech in the same city. We had a premonition that the Egyptian people would have another joyous event.

    At five o'clock in the afternoon, the Chinese Youth Delegation entered Liberation Square. Tens of thousands of people were gathering from all directions: elderly people wearing red square hats, teachers and students spending their summer vacation in Alexandria, women wearing black veils and long gowns, and officers in yellow khaki uniforms. They were happy and solemn, all anticipating the birth of a major historical event.

    The square was filled with a festive atmosphere. Colorful carpets surrounded the front of the square, forming many VIP seating areas. The sign "People's China" hung in the front left corner marked our seats. As we took our seats, people shouted, "Long live People's China!" We also shouted in Arabic, "China pays tribute to Egypt!" "Long live Sino-Egyptian friendship!" Each slogan aroused thunderous applause. Samara, one of the leaders of the Egyptian "Canal Workers Union," ran over to shake my hand warmly, welcoming the Chinese youth to visit Alexandria and participate in this important conference. I gave him a peace dove badge I had brought from Beijing.

    The walls on both sides of the square were covered with slogans from various districts and sectors of Alexandria welcoming President Nasser. The podium was set up on the balcony of a building on the front of the square, and a black, white, and red Egyptian "Liberation Rally" flag was erected under the stage.

    Before the speech began, Nadia, our Egyptian friend who had visited China, told me that not long ago, this building belonged to a company that monopolized the Egyptian cotton market. How much blood and sweat did imperialism and its agents extract from Egyptian farmers through it! Now, this house has become the office of the Egyptian "Liberation Rally" organization.

    This was the second time I had heard President Nasser speak. Late at night on January 16th of this year, I had listened with Nadia in China to Nasser's broadcast announcing the draft Egyptian constitution. Only six months had passed, but Egypt had already experienced many significant changes. The constitution was passed, Nasser was elected president; Egypt established diplomatic relations with our country; the last foreign soldier withdrew from the Suez Canal area.

    As I was recalling these past events, a burst of cheers suddenly rang out around me. President Nasser and other leaders of the Egyptian government arrived. They appeared on the podium and waved to the 250,000 people in the crowd.

    After an imam recited a passage from the Quran, President Nasser's speech began. Although I didn't understand Arabic, it was not difficult to comprehend the emotions he expressed from Nasser's sonorous tone and powerful gestures. Nadia listened and translated the content of the speech to me in fluent English. Every word revealed the Egyptian people's national pride and hatred of imperialism.

    At the beginning, President Nasser denounced the imperialists' attempts to stifle the Egyptian people's nationalism. President Nasser mentioned the Western countries' attempts to interfere with Egypt's freedom to purchase arms from foreign countries. Western countries had said that the arms recently purchased by Egypt were "communist arms." Nasser said, "As far as I know, once these weapons arrive here, they become the property of Egypt." This witty answer caused laughter throughout the audience.

    President Nasser said that the Egyptian people are very sensitive and have a strong sense of national self-esteem. When the masses heard the series of political conditions put forward by Britain and the United States for "assisting" in the construction of the Aswan High Dam, they waved their fists and shouted, "Freedom above all else!" "No dollars! No pounds!"

    The Egyptian people also have clear loves and hates. They responded to the Soviet Union's offer of unconditional assistance with warm applause. President Nasser spoke the words in the hearts of the Egyptian people: "Whoever is hostile to us is our enemy; whoever is friendly to us is our friend."

    President Nasser then talked about the history of the Suez Canal, about restoring Egypt's rights over the Suez Canal. The whole audience became more and more lively, and the speech was constantly interrupted by storms of applause. Suddenly, Nadia, who was sitting next to us, jumped up like a child, grasped my hands tightly, and shouted loudly into my ear, "The canal has been taken back! The president is reading the decree he signed today…." The whole square turned into a sea of ​​joy. People were laughing and shouting, "The canal is ours!" "Long live President Nasser!"

    The two-and-a-half-hour speech ended. The Chinese Youth Delegation shook hands and embraced Egyptian friends warmly. We congratulated them and said, "Tonight's speech is a heavy blow to imperialism. It is a major victory for the Egyptian people in the struggle against colonialism. We regard this victory as our own victory."

    People were singing and dancing in the square. My heart was beating violently along with the hearts of millions of Egyptian people. Through a layer of fog-like substance in my eyes, I saw countless eyes around me shining with bright tears. Countless people were jumping and spinning before my eyes. I felt that this was not Liberation Square, but a microcosm of the entire Egypt. In the joyful crowd, I seemed to see the simple farmers of Liberation Province, the sailors with wrinkled foreheads on the Suez Canal, the tanned workers by the Aswan Dam….

    At the same time, I also seemed to see: some pot-bellied Englishmen and Frenchmen, holding tightly to the blood-stained shares of the Suez Canal Company, roaring at the jubilant people. But their roars were drowned out by the Egyptian people's victorious laughter.

    On the way back to the hotel from Liberation Square, several young Egyptian guys accompanying us sang "Liberation Song" in the car, making gestures of shooting guns. They said, "If the imperialists want to attack the Suez Canal, we will fight them. Bang! Bang! Haha!"

    Even today, the image of the Egyptian people in Liberation Square, who were so excited and ecstatic about the recovery of the Suez Canal Company, still constantly appears in my mind. I seem to still hear their enthusiastic cheers and unrestrained laughter. And I know that a people who know how to laugh like this for freedom can never be conquered.

    回忆在埃及的历史性的一天
    刘振恺
    在埃及纳赛尔总统宣布苏彝士运河公司国有化之前，中国青年代表团在亚历山大已经进行了两天访问。在这些日子里，地中海显得风平浪静，谁能料想到从亚历山大这个宁静的海滨城市，就要兴起巨大的风暴，汹涌的浪潮将震撼英伦三岛，并且一直波及到大西洋的彼岸呢？
    7月26日，代表团接到当天下午去听纳赛尔总统发表一篇重要演说的邀请。对埃及人民来说，这一天原来就是一个富有历史意义的日子。四年前的这一天，法鲁克国王被驱逐出境了。从此埃及人民结束了封建王朝的统治，进入一个新的历史时期。
    埃及朋友特地选择了这个有意义的日子，给我们参观了法鲁克在亚历山大的宫殿、四年前他被放逐时登船的码头。埃及朋友说：法鲁克滚蛋了，这是埃及人民一椿天大的喜事。而在四年后的同一天，纳赛尔要在同一个城市发表演说，我们预感到：埃及人民将要有另一椿喜事了。
    下午五点，中国青年代表团进入解放广场。成千成万的人们正从四面八方汇集：有戴红色方帽的老年人，也有正在亚历山大度暑假的教师和学生，也有戴着黑纱穿着长衫的妇女，也有身着黄色咔叽制服的军官。他们愉快而严肃，都在期待着一件重大的历史事件的诞生。
    广场上笼罩着节日的气氛。彩色缤纷的毯子把广场的前部围成许多处贵宾席。左前方挂着一块“人民中国”的牌子的地方就是我们的席位。当我们就座的时候，人们高呼着：“人民中国万岁！”我们也用阿拉伯文高呼“中国向埃及致敬！”“中埃友谊万岁！”每一句口号都激起了如雷的掌声。埃及“运河职工联合会”的负责人之一萨马拉跑来和我亲切地握手，表示欢迎中国青年访问亚历山大并参加这次重要的报告会。我给他戴上了从北京带来的一只和平鸽纪念章。
    广场两旁的墙壁上挂满了亚历山大各市区和各界送来的欢迎纳赛尔总统的标语。讲台设在广场正面一座建筑物的阳台上，台下竖立着一面黑、白、红三色的埃及“解放大会”的旗帜。
    演说还没有开始，曾经访问过中国的陪同我们的埃及朋友纳迪亚告诉我说，不久以前，前面这座建筑物属于一个垄断埃及棉花市场的公司。帝国主义和它的代理人通过它榨取了多少埃及农民的血汗！现在，这所房子已经成为埃及“解放大会”组织的办公地点了。
    这已经是我第二次听纳赛尔总统的演说了。今年1月16日深夜，我在中国曾经和纳迪亚一起收听过纳赛尔宣布埃及宪法草案的广播。而今相距不过六个月，可是埃及已经经历了许多重大的变化。宪法被通过了，纳赛尔当选为总统；埃及和我国建立了外交关系；最后一个外国兵从苏彝士运河区撤走了。
    当我正在回忆这些往事的时候，四周忽然响起一阵欢呼。纳赛尔总统和埃及政府的其他领导人到场了。他们出现在讲台上，向二十五万群众频频挥手答礼。
    在一位阿訇朗诵了一段可兰经以后，纳赛尔总统的演说开始了。我虽然不懂阿拉伯文，但是从纳赛尔的铿锵的声调和有力的手势中，不难领会到他所表达的感情。纳迪亚一面听，一面用流利的英语给我译出演词的内容。他的每一个字都流露着埃及人民的民族自豪感和对帝国主义的憎恨。
    开始，纳赛尔总统斥责了帝国主义企图扼杀埃及人民民族主义的阴谋。纳赛尔总统提到了西方国家企图干涉埃及向外国自由购买军火的问题。西方国家曾经说埃及最近购买的军火是“共产主义的军火”。纳赛尔说“据我所知道的，这些武器一到了这儿，便成为埃及的财产了。”这个诙谐的回答引起全场的大笑。
    纳赛尔总统说，埃及人民是非常敏感的，是有着强烈的民族自尊心的。当群众听到英美“援助”建设阿斯旺高水坝所提出的一系列的政治条件时，他们挥舞着拳头喊道：“自由高于一切！”“不要美元！不要英镑！”
    埃及人民也是爱憎分明的。他们对于苏联提出无条件的援助报以热烈的掌声。纳赛尔总统说出了埃及人民心里的话：“谁敌视我们，就是我们的敌人；谁对我们友好，就是我们的朋友。”
    纳赛尔总统然后谈到苏彝士运河的历史，谈到要恢复埃及对苏彝士运河的权利，全场愈来愈活跃，演说不时被暴风雨般的掌声所打断。突然，坐在我们旁边的纳迪亚像小孩一样跳了起来，紧握着我的双手，大声地朝我的耳边叫道：“运河收回来了。总统在宣读他今天签了字的法令……。”全场变成了一片欢乐的海洋，人们在欢笑，在高呼“运河是我们的！”“纳赛尔总统万岁！”
    两小时半的演说结束了。中国青年代表团和埃及朋友亲切地握手和拥抱。我们祝贺他们说：“今晚的演说是对帝国主义狠狠的一击，是埃及人民在反对殖民主义的斗争中取得的重大胜利。我们把这个胜利看作是自己的胜利。”
    人们在广场上载歌载舞。我的心和千万颗埃及人民的心一起剧烈地跳动着。透过自己眼中一层像薄雾的东西，我看到周围无数只眼睛中在闪着亮闪闪的泪水。无数的人们在我的眼前跳跃、旋转。我感到这不是解放广场，而是整个埃及的缩影。在欢乐的人群中，我仿佛看到解放省朴实的农民，苏彝士运河上满额绉纹的水手、阿斯旺水坝旁晒得黝黑的工人……。
    同时，我似乎也看到：一些大腹便便的英国人和法国人，手里紧握着染满鲜血的苏彝士运河公司的股票，向狂欢的人们在大发雷霆。但是，他们的咆哮被埃及人民的胜利的欢笑所淹没了。
    从解放广场回到旅馆的途中，陪同我们的几个埃及青年小伙子在汽车里扯开嗓门唱着“解放歌”，做着开枪射击的姿势。他们说：“帝国主义要进攻苏彝士运河的话，我们就和它干起来。砰！砰！哈哈！”
    一直到今天，解放广场上被收回苏彝士运河公司的行动激动得如醉如狂的埃及人民的形象，还在我脑际不断浮现。我仿佛还听到他们的热烈的欢呼和纵情的大笑。而我知道，懂得这样为自由而笑的人民是永远不可能被征服的。
