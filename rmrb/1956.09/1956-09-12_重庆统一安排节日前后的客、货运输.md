    Chongqing Unified Arrangements for Passenger and Freight Transport Before and After the Holidays
    (Xinhua News Agency dispatch) The Third Office of the Chongqing Municipal People's Committee convened a meeting on the 8th with various transportation departments and major material units in Chongqing to unify arrangements for freight and passenger transport before and after the Mid-Autumn Festival and National Day.
    The meeting prioritized goods based on urgency, deciding to advance the transport of equipment needed by factories striving to complete their Five-Year Plans ahead of schedule, as well as goods supplied by commercial departments for the holidays. Of the goods imported via the Yangtze River in mid-September, one-third of the transport capacity will be used to transport steel billets, scrap steel, pig iron, and other materials necessary for Chongqing's iron and steel industry; one-quarter of the transport capacity will be used to guarantee the market needs of various parts of Sichuan Province and Chongqing before and after the holidays. Dark-colored printed cloth for autumn and winter use, as well as under-supplied white sugar and petroleum products, will be imported in advance. A portion of the electrical equipment and cultural supplies needed for automobile repair will also be imported in advance. Live pigs supplied to Chongqing will be transported immediately by rail, road, and waterway on a priority basis to meet the needs of the Mid-Autumn Festival.
    As of the 7th, out of the more than 136,000 tons of grain seeds supporting disaster areas in Jiangsu and Anhui provinces, 110,000 tons had been shipped out of Sichuan via Yangtze River ports such as Chongqing, Fuling, and Wanxian. The meeting decided to continue to prioritize the rush transport of grain seeds in the first half of September. Second, it will prioritize the rush transport of rice to support the disaster areas in Hebei, live pigs and flour needed by Wuhan City for the holidays, and pickled mustard tubers needed by Beijing. Appropriate arrangements were also made for the transport of cloth, white sugar, glutinous rice, and other items needed by medium and small cities for the holidays.
    The meeting believes that daily passenger transport this year has increased by about double compared to last year, and passenger transport during the National Day holiday will certainly be very crowded. Therefore, it requires all transportation departments to make preparations for machine maintenance and safe transport before September 25th. In response to passengers stranded in Chongqing awaiting passage out of Sichuan, the Chongqing Port Authority, in accordance with the instructions of the Yangtze River Navigation Administration, has shortened the routes of nine larger-horsepower steamships, specializing in navigation on the Sichuan section of the Yangtze River between Chongqing and Yichang, in order to accelerate the turnaround of ships.

    重庆统一安排节日前后的客、货运输
    据新华社讯　重庆市人民委员会第三办公室8日召集重庆市各运输部门和主要物资单位开会，统一安排中秋节和国庆节前后的货运和客运。
    会议根据需要物资的缓急作了排队，决定对各厂争取提前完成五年计划所需的器材和商业部门节日供应的物资提前运输。9月中旬长江进口，将以三分之一的运力运输重庆钢铁工业生产所必需的钢胚、废钢、生铁等；四分之一的运力用来保证四川省各地和重庆市节日前后的市场需要。秋冬用的深色花布、供应不足的白糖和石油产品都将提前进口。修理汽车所需的交电器材和文化用品等也将提前进口一部分。供应重庆市的生猪将立即由铁路、公路、水路优先赶运，以供应中秋节日的需要。
    支援江苏、安徽两省灾区的十三万六千多吨的粮种，到7日为止经由重庆、涪陵、万县等长江港口运出四川的已有十一万吨。会议决定9月份上半月继续优先抢运粮种。其次抢运支援河北灾区的大米、武汉市节日需要的生猪、面粉和北京需要的榨菜等。对中、小城市节日需要的布匹、白糖、糯米等的运输也作了适当的安排。
    会议认为，今年平日客运约比去年增加一倍，国庆节假日客运一定十分拥挤。因此要求各运输部门在9月25日前做机器检修、安全运输等准备工作。对滞留在重庆的出川旅客，重庆港务局已根据长江航运管理局的指示，缩短九只马力较大的轮船的航线，专航重庆宜昌间的川江，以加速船只的周转。
