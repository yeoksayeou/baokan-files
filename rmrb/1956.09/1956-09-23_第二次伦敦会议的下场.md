　　The Second London Conference, held to seek support for a plan to intervene in Egypt by force, has ended in another failure for the United States, Britain, and France.

　　The Second London Conference clearly demonstrated how isolated the United States, Britain, and France are in this world in their attempt to launch a war of aggression. Despite Dulles's relentless efforts to persuade other countries to support his "Users' Association" plan, this plan was still met with widespread opposition and suspicion. Those countries that had supported the United States, Britain, and France at the First London Conference have begun to realize that continuing to follow the adventurous plans of the Western colonial powers will put them in a very dangerous situation. The Pakistani representative pointed out that the "Users' Association" "may lead to the use of force," therefore Pakistan "cannot support this proposal." Many other countries also adopted an extremely reserved attitude.

　　In this situation, the United States was forced to take a step back, agreeing to amend the "Users' Association" plan, and hastily ended the conference after drafting a statement and a declaration on the establishment of the "Users' Association." However, the countries participating in the conference did not sign these documents, and the representatives of each country only agreed to take the plan back for consultation with their respective governments. The conspiracy of the United States, Britain, and France to drag other countries onto their war chariot suffered a shameful bankruptcy.

　　However, another failure for the United States, Britain, and France does not mean that they will abandon their intention to intervene in Egypt by force. Dulles bluntly stated at the London Conference: Regarding the "final solution" to the Suez Canal issue, "we should insist on our opinion." In other words, the United States will insist on its position of infringing on Egyptian sovereignty. Dulles also said that the United States is showing great restraint, but cannot expect this restraint to continue unless a solution that satisfies the United States, Britain, and France is obtained. A piece of news revealed by the Associated Press is very noteworthy. The news said that the reason Dulles adopted a so-called "milder" stance was because "the United States' requirement is to proceed 'firmly and slowly' before the US elections in November." This shows that after the US elections, the United States may very well further collude with Britain and France to plan an armed intervention in Egypt. Therefore, it is very clear that as long as the United States, Britain, and France do not abandon their position of infringing on Egyptian sovereignty and seizing the Suez Canal, the threat of war cannot be eliminated for a single day.

　　In the declaration on the establishment of the "Users' Association" drafted at the London Conference, it is stipulated that the association will interfere in the navigation and management of the Suez Canal, which prepares a ready-made excuse for future armed intervention by the United States, Britain, and France. At the same time, from the statement and declaration drafted at the London Conference, as well as Dulles's letter to British Foreign Secretary Lloyd, it can be seen that what the United States, Britain, and France will do immediately after the conference is to exert economic pressure on Egypt, implementing so-called economic "sanctions." The method is to reduce the use of the canal, plunder more of the canal tolls that should have been paid to Egypt, and implement an economic blockade against Egypt, making Egypt unable to pay the management costs of the Suez Canal, thereby paralyzing the navigation of the canal. At the same time, the United States, Britain, and France are attempting to use this means to provoke relations between Egypt and other Arab countries, to isolate Egypt, in order to force Egypt to submit.

　　It can be predicted that after the London Conference, the United States, Britain, and France will exert strong pressure on other countries, forcing them to accept the "Users' Association" plan, while stepping up their efforts to sow discord between Egypt and other Arab countries.

　　However, the ruling groups in Britain and France should know that whether they launch an armed intervention against Egypt with the support of the United States, or impose economic "sanctions," it is they themselves who will ultimately suffer. Egypt has many friends in the world, and it can count on the full support of the Soviet Union, China, India, and all peace-loving people, who cannot be defeated. And Britain, which will not be able to repay its debts to the United States until the year 2000, will only be forced to permanently escape the control of the United States by borrowing from Wall Street again. The United States will force Britain and France to give up more of their territory in the capacity of a usurer, including Britain's oil interests in the Middle East and its export markets throughout Asia. Therefore, it is only a very naive fantasy for the ruling groups in Britain and France to expect the United States to protect their interests. Not only will they not get what they want, but they will also lose everything they still have in their hands.

　　Other countries participating in the London Conference must now be very vigilant. They have already wisely avoided any obligations to the "Users' Association" plan at the conference, and they must also be astute enough to reject the US, British, and French deception and enticement after the conference. If they participate in the provocation against Egypt under the enticement of the United States, their interests will be seriously damaged. Because the Egyptian authorities have always demonstrated excellent ability to manage the canal, and have not violated the interests of the canal users in the slightest. If they follow the United States, Britain, and France to abandon the existing Suez Canal and go around the Cape of Good Hope, and take on a dollar debt for the benefit of the United States, wouldn't that be making trouble for themselves and asking for trouble? Moreover, once this "Users' Association" is used by the United States to launch an armed intervention, they will be dragged into the water by the United States, and thus bear the serious responsibility of undermining peace.

　　The Second London Conference has shown the direction of world public opinion. The United States, Britain, and France should be able to see what the outcome will be if they blindly act recklessly. If they abandon the road of peaceful negotiation and insist on dancing with their eyes closed on the brink of war, then it is truly a case of "those who commit many unrighteousness, will surely destroy themselves."

### 第二次伦敦会议的下场

    第二次伦敦会议的下场
    为了给武力干涉埃及的计划寻找支持而举行的第二次伦敦会议，已经以美、英、法三国的又一次失败而告终。
    第二次伦敦会议清楚地说明了在这个世界上，企图发动侵略战争的美、英、法三国是何等的孤立。尽管杜勒斯舌燥唇焦地企图说服其他国家支持他的“使用国协会”计划，但是这个计划仍然遭到了普遍的反对和怀疑。那些曾经在第一次伦敦会议上支持美、英、法的国家，已经开始认识到继续追随西方殖民国家的冒险计划将使自己陷入十分危险的境地。巴基斯坦代表指出，“使用国协会”“可能导致武力的使用”，因此巴基斯坦“不能够支持这个建议”。其他许多国家也采取了极为保留的态度。
    在这种情况下，美国不得不被迫采取退一步的做法，同意对“使用国协会”计划进行修改，并在拟订了一个声明和一个关于成立“使用国协会”的宣言以后，草草地结束了这次会议。但是参加会议的国家并没有在这些文件上签字，各国代表仅仅同意把计划带回去同各自的政府进行磋商。英、法、美三国企图把其他国家套在它们的战车上的阴谋，遭到了可耻的破产。
    然而，美、英、法三国的又一次失败，并不意味着它们将会从此放弃武装干涉埃及的打算。杜勒斯在伦敦会议上露骨地说：关于苏伊士运河问题的“最后解决办法，我们应当坚持我们的意见”。换句话说，美国将坚持侵犯埃及主权的立场。杜勒斯并且说，美国正在表现很大的抑制，但不能指望这种抑制继续下去，除非获得一个能使美、英、法三国满意的解决办法。合众社透露的一个消息是非常值得注意的。这个消息说，杜勒斯所以采取所谓“较温和”的姿态，是因为“美国的要求是要在11月的美国选举之前‘坚决而缓慢’地搞”。这就说明，在美国大选以后，美国完全有可能进一步同英、法策划对埃及的武装干涉。因此，很明显，只要美、英、法一天不放弃侵犯埃及主权和夺取苏伊士运河的立场，战争威胁就一天不能消除。
    在伦敦会议所拟订的关于成立“使用国协会”的宣言中，规定这个协会将干涉苏伊士运河的通航和管理，这就为将来美、英、法进行武装干涉准备好了现成的借口。同时，从伦敦会议拟订的声明和宣言，以及杜勒斯给英国外交大臣劳埃德的信可以看出，美、英、法三国在会后将要立即进行的就是对埃及施加经济上的压力，实行所谓经济“制裁”。其办法就是减少使用运河，更多地劫夺本来应该付给埃及的运河通航费，对埃及实行经济封锁，使埃及无力支付苏伊士运河的管理费用，从而使运河的航行陷于瘫痪。同时，美、英、法企图用这种手段来挑拨埃及同其他阿拉伯国家之间的关系，来孤立埃及，以便迫使埃及就范。
    可以预料，在伦敦会议以后，美、英、法三国将对其他国家施加强大的压力，迫使它们接受“使用国协会”的计划，同时加紧在埃及同其他阿拉伯国家之间进行挑拨离间。
    但是，英、法两国统治集团应该知道，它们在美国的支持下向埃及发动武装干涉也罢，施加经济“制裁”也罢，最后倒霉的将是它们自己。埃及在世界上有许多朋友，它可以指望苏联、中国、印度以及一切爱好和平的人民的全力支持，他们是不可能被战胜的。而到公元二千年才能偿清美国债务的英国，再要向华尔街举债，就只能使英国永远逃脱不了美国的控制。美国将以高利贷者的身份迫使英、法更多地出让自己的地盘，包括英国在中东的石油利益，和它在整个亚洲的出口市场在内。因此，英法两国统治集团指望美国来保护他们的利益，只是一个十分天真的幻想罢了，他们不但不能因此得到他们想得到的东西，而且将失掉现在还在他们手里的一切。
    参加伦敦会议的其他国家，现在必须十分警惕。它们已经在会议上明智地避免了对“使用国协会”计划承担任何义务，它们也必须有足够的机警来拒绝美、英、法在会后对它们的诱骗和拉拢。它们如果在美国的诱骗下参加对埃及的挑衅，它们的利益就会受到严重的损害。因为，埃及当局一直表现了管理运河的卓越的才能，对于运河使用国的利益秋毫无犯。它们要是跟着美、英、法去放着现成的苏伊士运河不走，却去绕道好望角，为了美国的利益而去背上一笔美元的债务，这岂不是在庸人自扰，自讨苦吃吗？而且，一旦这个“使用国协会”被美国利用来发动武装干涉，它们就会被美国拖下水去，因而担负起破坏和平的严重的责任。
    第二次伦敦会议已经显示了世界人心的向背。美、英、法三国应该可以看到它们一味蛮干会得个怎样的下场。如果它们放着和平谈判的大道不走，却一定要到战争边缘上去闭着眼睛跳舞，那真是所谓“自作孽，不可活”了。
