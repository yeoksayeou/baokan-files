Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou Telegram. The decline in sideline production in the Xinmin Township Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xinhui County, Guangdong Province, has been reversed. In the past one or two months, they have earned more than 7,000 yuan. Ten cooperative members with various specialized skills are busy with various sideline productions. The cooperative has raised a large number of pigs, sheep, and ducks. The fish ponds, covering an area of more than 70 mu, are also stocked with fish.

The change in the Xinmin Township Agricultural Cooperative is the result of the cooperative cadres changing their past subjectivist and mandatory leadership style and implementing democratic cooperative management. In the past, the cooperative cadres generally made decisions and then "implemented" them downwards, rarely listening to the opinions of the cooperative members. For example, this spring, the cooperative cadres decided to plant 100 mu of wax gourd. Experienced cooperative members objected, but their objections were ineffective. They reluctantly planted 80 mu, but because it conflicted with the early rice transplanting time, the gourds were plowed under and early rice was planted instead.

In the summer, after the cooperative cadres conducted in-depth inspections and criticized this subjectivist leadership style, they mobilized cooperative members to offer opinions on developing sideline production. Based on the principles of adapting to local conditions and adapting to the times, the cooperative members put forward various suggestions for developing sideline production. According to these suggestions, the sideline production that can be realized in the second half of this year alone includes fish farming in ponds, milking cows, raising calves, and processing preserved ducks for food companies, a total of seven items, which are estimated to generate a net profit of more than 26,000 yuan.

### 改变主观主义作风  副业生产有了发展

    改变主观主义作风  副业生产有了发展
    据新华社广州电　广东省新会县新民乡农业生产合作社副业生产的下降的情况已经改变，近一两个月来，已获得七千多元的收入，十个具有各种专门技术的社员正忙着各种副业生产，社里已经饲养了大量的猪、羊和鸭子，面积达七十多亩的鱼塘，也养了鱼。
    新民乡农业社这种变化，是社干部改变过去主观主义和强迫命令的领导作风，实行民主办社的结果。这个社过去一般都是由干部决定事情后，就往下“贯彻”，很少倾听社员的意见。例如今年春天，社干部决定要种合瓜一百亩，有经验的社员提出反对意见无效后，勉强种下八十亩，因为和早稻插秧时间矛盾，瓜未长大就犁掉改种早稻。
    夏季里，社干部深入检查和批判了这种主观主义领导作风后，即发动社员对发展副业生产提出意见。社员们根据因地制宜、因时制宜的原则，提出发展副业生产的各项建议。根据这些建议，仅今年下半年可以实现的就有水塘养鱼、挤牛奶、养小牛、代食品公司加工腊鸭等七项副业，估计可获得纯利二万六千多元。
