Xinhua News Agency, 5th. Paris dispatch: All Arab countries' diplomatic envoys in Paris on September 4th requested a collective meeting with French Foreign Minister Pineau to protest against Pineau's remarks on September 2nd concerning the Suez Canal issue, which were intended to sow discord among Arab countries.

The Arab countries' diplomatic representatives in Paris made the request to meet with Pineau after a meeting held at the Egyptian Embassy on the evening of September 3rd. The meeting issued a communique stating that the Arab countries "firmly support Egypt's position" and believe that "a threat to Egypt is a threat to all Arab countries."

According to Agence France-Presse, Pineau has refused to meet with the Arab countries' diplomatic representatives as a group, and has only agreed to "meet with them individually in the coming days." United Press International said that a French Foreign Ministry spokesman explained that Pineau refused to meet with the Arab countries' representatives as a group because it was "contrary to diplomatic procedure." However, observers in Paris pointed out that Arab countries' diplomats have always collectively visited Western foreign ministers.

    抗议挑拨阿拉伯国家团结的言论
    阿拉伯国家驻法使节要求集体会见比诺
    新华社5日讯　巴黎消息：所有阿拉伯国家驻巴黎的外交使节9月4日要求集体会见法国外交部长比诺，以抗议比诺9月2日所发表的就苏彝士运河问题挑拨阿拉伯国家团结的言论。
    阿拉伯国家驻巴黎的外交代表是在9月3日晚上在埃及大使馆举行会议后提出会见比诺的要求的。这个会议曾经发表了一个公报说，阿拉伯国家“坚定地支持埃及的立场”，并且认为“对埃及的威胁就是对所有阿拉伯国家的威胁”。
    据法新社消息说，比诺已经拒绝接见阿拉伯国家的外交代表，而只是答应“在今后几天之内分别接见他们”。合众社说，法国外交部发言人解释说，比诺之所以拒绝把阿拉伯国家的代表当作一个集团来接见，是因为这是“违背外交程序的”。但是巴黎的观察家指出，阿拉伯国家的外交家一向是集体访问西方的外交部长的。
