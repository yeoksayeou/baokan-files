Rescue Vessel
Squad Leader Zheng Shiquan

　　February 18th. As the afterglow of the setting sun disappeared on the calm sea off Nantian, and the national flag on the boat was being lowered, sailors on the deck of a gunboat to our starboard were singing new songs along with a violin solo, everyone was enjoying this day of life at sea in a happy mood.

　　The sky suddenly darkened, and the vast ocean was shrouded in dark clouds, thick chunks of black clouds seeming to run overhead. This kind of sky already told us that a storm at sea was coming.

　　At 17:50, we suddenly received a signal from the ×× signal station, asking us to pay attention to contacting the Naval Headquarters of ×× Port. It was time for our radio to receive messages, and everyone was waiting for orders from the headquarters. Before the telegram was even translated, comrades began to prepare for sailing, because in this kind of weather, we were bound to have the task of protecting fishing boats.

　　From the tense preparations, the order from the General Headquarters came, and as we expected, we were ordered to quickly start the engines and set sail to rescue fishing boats in distress at sea. Several engine soldiers quickly started the engines, and the boat headed straight south. The storm howled with a whistling sound, and the boat swayed to about thirty degrees. During the voyage, we spotted a fishing boat far away. Looking through the binoculars, we could only see a few fishermen sitting on it, the fishing boat sometimes buried in the waves, and sometimes pushed by the wind to the crests, the fishing boat was in danger. We sped towards the fishing boat, the roar of the violent wind and waves made it impossible for us to hear even the people on our own boat speaking. We could only vaguely see the few fishermen on the fishing boat waving their arms and calling for help.

　　Long-term life at sea, coming and going in the wind and waves, has made us deeply appreciate the hardships of fishermen's lives, and the relationship between sailors and fishermen is already like blood connected to flesh. All the comrades on the boat were watching me on the deck in front of the wheelhouse, hoping to speed up and rescue the fishing boat. I watched the speedometer that was running. Personally increased the throttle to advance quickly.

　　The boat arrived next to the fishing boat, less than ten meters away. In order to avoid damaging the fishing boat, we dared not go any further. We told them to slowly approach the starboard side of our boat so that we could tow them away. The wind and waves were really too strong, the fishing boat was full of water, and an elderly fisherman was bailing water out, every fisherman's clothes were soaked, and waves of seawater hit their heads, making it impossible for them to open their eyes. They struggled against the wind and waves to get closer to us, and the fishing boat was constantly thrown away by the waves. The sailors who were vigilantly watching on the deck tried every means to bring the boats closer, and finally managed to throw the cable accurately, and the fishing boat was tied to our boat. The boat bosses were so happy that they laughed with their heads up. When we safely towed them back to port, several old fishermen said in unison: "Thank you, sailor comrades, if it weren't for you coming to save us today, our lives would have been over."

　　February 19th. We got up at dawn. The fishing boat we rescued last night also raised its sails and prepared to go home. They intentionally passed our port side, shouting loudly: "Goodbye, sailor comrades. Please rest assured, when we return home safely, we will always remember your kindness." We stood on the deck, and for a long time still saw them waving to us.

　　The sun slowly rose from the sea, and the sea was brightly illuminated. Before long, a gunboat sailed from the east. It turned out that they had spent the night rescuing a fishing boat that had been hit on the rocks, and only towed the fishing boat back to × port at high tide at two o'clock in the morning.

　　Before the gunboat had docked properly, the comrades told us: The ×× gunboat risked winds of force eight or higher to rescue a fishing boat, the boat was almost buried in the sea, and had not returned for a long time. The headquarters sent a message to the × Mountain troops, and the leaders also personally searched for a long time on the high mountains with binoculars, but still could not find it. Everyone thought that this boat was hopeless, but this boat resolutely returned to port until evening. The cabin was full of seawater, and the bedding was soaked. The most surprising thing for us was that the front deck's main gun mount had been broken by the waves. Thanks to the bravery of the sailors, they tied it firmly to the deck in waist-deep water, and thus avoided major losses.

    抢救轮
    机班长　郑世全
      2月18日。当落日的余霞消失在南田平静的海面，艇上的国旗正降落的时候，靠我们右舷的一艘炮艇甲板上，水兵们在手提琴的独奏中合唱起新的歌曲，大家正以愉快的心情度过这一天的海洋生活。
    天色突然黑下来，汪洋大海被黑云笼罩着，浓厚的大块黑云就像在头上跑。这样的天色，已经告诉我们海上的风暴就要来了。
    十七时五十分，突然接到××信号台发给我们的信号，要我们注意与××港海军总指挥部联系。我们的电台收报时间到了，大家正等待着指挥部的命令。电报还未翻译出来，同志们就开始作好出航的准备，因为在这样的天气里，我们定有护渔的任务。
    从紧张的准备工作中，传来了总指挥部的命令，果不出我们所料，要我们很快发动机器，出航救护海上遇险的渔船。几个轮机兵动作迅速地把机器发动起来了，艇直向正南驶进。暴风带着哨音呼啸起来，艇摇摆到三十度左右。在航行途中，远远发现一艘渔船。从望远镜里望过去，只见上面坐着几个渔民，时而渔船埋进浪涛里，时而又被风推到浪头上，渔船在危险中。我们朝着渔船疾驶，狂风大浪的怒吼声，使我们连本艇上的人讲话都听不清。我们只能模糊地看到渔船上的几个渔民在向我们挥动着胳膊呼救。
    长期的海洋生活，风里来，浪里去，使我们深深地体会到渔民生活的艰险，水兵和渔民的关系已经像血连着肉。全艇的同志们都在驾驶室前的甲板上望着我，希望加快速度去抢救渔船。我注视着正在运转的速度表。亲自增加油门，快速前进。
    艇到达渔船旁，距离不到十公尺，为了避免撞坏渔船，不敢再前进了。要他们慢慢靠近艇的右舷，以便拖着走。风浪实在太大，渔船里浸满了水，有个年纪大的渔民正在向外排水，每个渔民的衣服都湿透了，一阵阵海水打到他们头上，使得他们眼睛都睁不开。他们顶着风，迎着浪向我们靠近，渔船又不时被浪抛远。正在甲板上坚持了望的水兵们想尽办法使船靠拢，最后终于把缆绳甩准了，渔船系到艇上来。船老大们欢喜得仰头在笑。当我们安全地把他们拖回港的时候，几个老渔民异口同声地说：“谢谢你们水兵同志，今天要不是你们来救我们，我们的命就算完了。”
           ×　　×　　×
    2月19日。天刚拂晓，我们就起床了。昨夜被我们救起的渔船也张起帆篷准备回家。他们特意经过我们的左舷，高声喊着：“再见吧，水兵同志。请你们放心，我们安全回到家里，会永远记住你们的情谊。”我们在甲板上，久久还看到他们在向我们挥手示意。
    太阳从海上慢慢升起来，海水被照得发亮。不一会，从东面驶来一艘炮艇。原来他们是昨天夜里为了救护一只被碰在礁石上的渔船，等到深夜两点涨潮时才把渔船拖回×港的。
    炮艇还没有靠好，同志们就告诉我们：××炮艇为了抢救渔船冒着八级以上的风浪，艇几乎埋进海水里，很久还未回来。指挥部发报给×山部队，首长们也亲自带着望远镜在高山上寻找许久仍未找到。大家都认为这只艇没希望了，一直到傍晚，这只艇毅然返航了。舱里浸满了海水，被服都湿透了，最使我们惊奇的是前甲板的主炮座都被海浪冲断了，由于水兵们的勇敢，在没腰深的海水中，把它牢牢地系在甲板上，才未受大损失。
