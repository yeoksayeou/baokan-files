Jiangsu Peasants Expand Late Autumn Planting Area
Strive for a Grain Increase of 150 Million Jin

(Reported by this newspaper) Farmers in various parts of Jiangsu Province are actively expanding the planting area of late autumn crops by utilizing the gap of more than two months before wheat planting after the harvest of early autumn crops such as early rice, early soybeans, and spring corn. This is to strive for increased autumn harvest production and to make up for the poor wheat harvest. It is estimated that the province's late autumn planting area will exceed four million mu, an increase of more than 1.5 million mu compared to last year. Assuming an increase of 100 jin per mu, grain production can be increased by 150 million jin.

Utilizing early autumn stubble and planting various late autumn crops according to local conditions has become an important measure for various localities to strive for increased autumn harvest production and ensure that more than 90% of cooperative members increase their income. After the harvest of 700,000 mu of early rice in the coastal areas of Songjiang Special District, all of it has been planted with mung beans, buckwheat, late sweet potatoes, late corn, and vegetables. Agricultural cooperatives in Nantong Special District also intercropped carrots in cotton fields with poor growth, without affecting cotton production. According to the characteristics of one-season rice paddy fields in the Lixiahe area, agricultural cooperatives actively developed aquatic crops after the early rice harvest. Yancheng and Jianhu counties planted 200,000 mu of arrowhead and water chestnut this year. Huaiyin Special District, which suffered severe waterlogging disasters, put forward the slogan "Plant More Late Autumn Crops, Produce for Self-Relief," and while draining water, they sowed late autumn crops. This year, each household in Guanyun County planted an average of 0.3 to 0.5 mu of carrots.

In order to support agricultural cooperatives in expanding the planting area of late autumn crops, various localities have also allocated and supplied a large number of late autumn seeds such as mung beans, carrots, and buckwheat. This year, the province allocated 6 million jin of late autumn seeds.

    江苏农民扩大晚秋播种面积
    争取增产粮食一亿五千万斤
    本报讯　江苏省各地农民，在早稻、早大豆、春玉米等早秋作物收获后，利用种麦前二个多月的空隙时间，积极扩大晚秋作物播种面积，以争取秋熟超产，弥补小麦歉收。预计全省晚秋种植面积可超过四百万亩，比去年扩大一百五十多万亩。以每亩增产一百斤计算，可增产粮食一亿五千万斤。
    利用早秋茬，因地制宜地多种晚秋作物，已成为各地当前争取秋熟增产和保证百分之九十以上社员增加收入的重要措施。松江专区沿海一带的七十万亩早稻收获后，已全部种上了绿豆、荞麦、晚山芋、晚玉米和蔬菜等。南通专区的农业社在不影响棉花生产的前提下还利用生长较差的棉田套种了葫萝卜。里下河地区的农业社，根据当地一熟沤田的特点，在早稻收割后，积极发展水生作物，盐城、建湖二县今年就种了二十万亩茨菇和荸荠。遭受水涝灾害较重的淮阴专区，提出了“多种晚秋、生产自救”的口号，一面排除积水，一面播种晚秋。灌云县今年平均每户种上三分到五分地的葫萝卜。
    为了支援农业社扩大晚秋播种面积，各地还调拨供应了大批绿豆、葫萝卜、荞麦等晚秋种子，全省今年调拨的晚秋种子就有六百万斤。
