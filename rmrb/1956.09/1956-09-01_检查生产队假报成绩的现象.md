Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 29th -- The Communist Party of China (CPC) Shangdu County Erdaowa General Branch recently helped the agricultural production cooperatives in its township to inspect and correct the bad phenomenon of falsely reporting achievements. The Erdaowa Shuguang Agricultural Production Cooperative held a meeting of member representatives in early August. Many member representatives exposed the phenomenon of false and exaggerated production reports by some production teams. This issue attracted the attention of the CPC Erdaowa Township General Branch. Party General Branch members, along with cooperative cadres, organized an inspection team and went to various production teams to conduct inspections in conjunction with current production work.

The inspection revealed that the phenomenon of falsely reporting production achievements in this cooperative was very serious. For example, the Erdaowa production team's 385 mu of rapeseed, flax, and naked oats had not been weeded even once, but they falsely reported to the cooperative that they had weeded them all once. The Yanjiafang production team originally reported that 196 mu of yams had been weeded three times, but they had only been weeded twice in reality. The Erdaowa production team applied fertilizer to the yam fields, but actually only applied more than 600 cartloads of fertilizer, while falsely reporting more than 2,760 cartloads.

These instances of falsely reporting production achievements have seriously affected production plans and increased production targets. The Erdaowa General Branch is further investigating the reasons and helping to resolve the issues.

    检查生产队假报成绩的现象
    新华社保定29日电　中共商都县二道洼总支部最近帮助该乡农业生产合作社检查纠正了虚报成绩的不良现象。二道洼曙光农业生产合作社，在8月上旬召开了社员代表大会，不少的社员代表在会上揭发了某些生产队假报和虚报生产成绩的现象。这个问题引起了中共二道洼乡总支的注意，党总支部委员协同社干部组织检查组，分头到各生产队结合当前生产工作进行了检查。
    检查发现这个社假报生产成绩的现象是很严重的。如二道洼生产队经营的三百八十五亩菜籽、胡麻、莜麦等作物一次也没锄过，他们向社里假报说都锄了一遍。阎家坊生产队，原来报了一百九十六亩山药锄了三遍，实际才锄过两遍。二道洼生产队在山药地上追肥，实际只下了六百多车肥，可是假报为二千七百六十多车肥。
    这些假报生产成绩的现象，严重的影响了生产计划与增产指标。二道洼总支部正在进一步检查原因帮助解决。
