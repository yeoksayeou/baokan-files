Xinhua News Agency News: Shen Kun, who only attended private school for five years, was admitted to the History Specialization Department of Jiangxi Normal College this year, choosing it as his first-choice school and department.

Shen Kun is twenty-nine years old this year and is from Henan. His family farms the land. He only attended private school for five years, starting at the age of ten. Five years ago, when he came to Nanchang First Middle School in Jiangxi Province as a handyman, he could only write short articles of one or two hundred words. Later, he used his spare time to learn arithmetic under the guidance of teacher Zhou Qingyuan. He would calculate late into the night every night.

After a year and a half, he progressed from addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to algebra; he also studied chemistry and physics. At this time, he felt that his Chinese language foundation was too poor, so he began to study Chinese again. Last year, after he was transferred to work in the canteen management of Nanchang Second High School, he still persisted in studying regularly.

Shen Kun saw that many students in the school went to university every year, and he often wondered when he would be able to go to university himself. This year, when he told the principal his desire to go to university, he was encouraged. Shen Kun is very interested in Chinese and foreign history, so he plans to study history at university. During his time at the cram school, Zhou Qingyuan and the school's history and geography teachers often took the initiative to help him review his lessons.

Because he persisted in diligent study for four or five years, he did not feel too much difficulty when participating in the entrance examination.

    沈琨考进了大学
    据新华社讯　只上过五年私塾的沈琨，今年以第一志愿学校和系科考进了江西师范学院历史专修科。
    沈琨今年二十九岁，河南人，家里是种地的，他只在十岁起上了五年私塾。五年前他到江西省南昌第一中学当工友时，只能写一、二百字的短文。以后他利用空闲时间，在教师周庆元的指导下开始学算术。他每天晚上一算就算到夜深。
    一年半后，他从加减乘除学到代数；另外还学了化学、物理。这时，他感到自己语文基础太差，于是又开始学语文。去年他被调到南昌第二高中做膳堂管理工作后，还是坚持着经常学习。
    沈琨看到学校里每年有很多学生上大学，他常想自己什么时候也能上大学呢？今年，当他把想考大学的愿望告诉校长后，得到了鼓励。沈琨对中外历史很感兴趣，因此打算到大学里去学历史。在补习学校补习期间，周庆元和学校的历史、地理教师常常主动的帮他温习功课。
    因为他坚持四、五年的经常刻苦学习，所以在参加入学考试时，并不觉得有太大的困难。
