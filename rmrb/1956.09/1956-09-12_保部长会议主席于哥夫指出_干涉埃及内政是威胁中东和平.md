Xinhua News Agency, 11th. According to a Bulgarian News Agency report on the 10th: The Chairman of the Bulgarian Council of Ministers, Yugov, when answering questions from Egyptian reporters, said that the Egyptian government's decision to nationalize the Suez Canal was a completely legal action. Bulgaria firmly opposes the brutal threats by some countries against Egypt to force it to abandon its sovereignty. This attempt to interfere in Egypt's internal affairs is a serious threat to peace in the Middle East and the world.

Yugov also spoke to the Egyptian reporters about the relations between Bulgaria and Egypt. He said that the relations between Bulgaria and Egypt are those between two friendly countries. The two governments follow the principles of peaceful coexistence, mutual respect for interests, and non-interference in each other's internal affairs. Recently, trade, cultural and other ties between the two countries have greatly expanded. In the first half of this year, the trade volume between the two countries increased several times compared with 1954 and 1955. Yugov said that the ties between Bulgaria and Egypt in many other areas are also constantly strengthening. I am deeply convinced that the visit of Egyptian President Nasser to Bulgaria will greatly promote the development and consolidation of the ties and cooperation between our two peoples.

In answering another question, Yugov said that Bulgaria's relations with other Balkan countries, especially with Yugoslavia, are constantly improving.

In the relations between Balkan countries, there are such conditions, and as long as there is sincerity, these conditions can be developed, leading to the establishment of broader and more comprehensive economic and cultural cooperation.

We are deeply convinced that our two countries' sincere efforts in establishing such relations will receive a good response from all Balkan countries, because this is in line with the interests of our two countries.

    保部长会议主席于哥夫指出
    干涉埃及内政是威胁中东和平
    新华社11日讯　据保加利亚通讯社10日报道：保加利亚部长会议主席于哥夫在回答埃及记者向他提出的问题的时候说，埃及政府把苏彝士运河收归国有的决定是完全合法的行动。保加利亚坚决反对某些国家对埃及施加粗暴威胁以迫使它放弃自己的主权的这种手段。这种干涉埃及内政的企图是对中东和全世界的和平的严重的威胁。
    于哥夫还向埃及记者谈到了保埃两国的关系。他说，保埃两国之间的关系是两个友好国家之间的关系。两国政府遵循和平共处，互相尊重利益和互不干涉内政这些原则。近来，两国间的贸易、文化等方面的联系大大地扩大了。在今年上半年，两国的贸易量比1954年和1955年增加了几倍。于哥夫说，保加利亚和埃及在其他许多方面的联系也在不断加强。我深信，埃及共和国总统纳赛尔将到保加利亚访问一事将在很大的程度上促进发展和巩固我们两国人民之间的联系和合作。
    在回答另外一个问题的时候，于哥夫说，保加利亚同其他巴尔干国家特别是同南斯拉夫的关系正在不断改善。
    在巴尔干国家的关系中有了这样一些条件，只要有诚意，这些条件就可以得到发展，导致建立更广泛的和更全面的经济和文化合作。
    我们深信，我们两国在建立这种关系方面的真诚努力将获得所有巴尔干国家的良好反应，因为这是符合我们两国的利益的。
