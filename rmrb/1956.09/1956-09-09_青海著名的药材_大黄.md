Qinghai's Famous Medicinal Material - Rhubarb
Wang Zixin

Qinghai Province not only has rich mineral resources, but also abounds in the world-famous medicinal material - rhubarb.

Qinghai's rhubarb has a high yield and good quality. The grasslands of the Qinghai Plateau and the Qilian Mountains, Tongren, and Datong areas are the main producing areas of rhubarb. Digging rhubarb is one of the main sideline productions of the local ethnic minorities.

Rhubarb is a major raw material in traditional Chinese medicine preparations. It can be used to invigorate the stomach and treat constipation, playing a certain role in medical treatment. Rhubarb belongs to the wild Polygonaceae plants and grows for many years in valleys and shaded areas. Its rhizomes are large and fat, like taro, and fresh ones weigh more than thirty catties, with some large ones even weighing sixty catties.

The rhubarb used for pharmaceutical purposes is its underground rhizome. The digging time is usually in spring and autumn; spring is between March and April, and autumn is between August and September. In summer, when rhubarb sprouts, the nutrients contained in the rhizomes are reduced, so it is not suitable for digging. In autumn, between August and September, the amount of juice stored in the underground rhizome cells is very rich, and the content of effective ingredients is also the highest.

Qinghai rhubarb not only has a broad sales market in the domestic market, but also enjoys a high reputation in the international market. In recent years, rhubarb has tended to be in short supply in international trade. In order to actively develop sideline production of ethnic minorities, increase income, and meet market needs, state-owned trading companies adjust purchase prices reasonably according to the ratio of medicinal materials to grain in each rhubarb production season, and send people to the countryside to guide ethnic minorities to improve production.

    青海著名的药材——大黄
    王子新
    在青海境内不但蕴藏着丰富的矿产，而且盛产着世界著名药材——大黄。
    青海的大黄产量多、质量好。青海高原草地和祁连山、同仁、大通地区，是大黄主要产地，挖掘大黄是当地少数民族主要副业生产之一。
    大黄是中药制剂中的主要原料，可以用来健胃，治疗便秘等病症，在医疗上起着一定的作用。大黄是属于野生的蓼科植物，多年生长在山谷和林荫地带，根茎肥大，像芋头，新鲜的有三十多斤重，大的甚至有六十斤重的。
    制药用的大黄，是它的地下根茎，挖掘时间通常是春秋两季；春季是三、四月间，秋季是八、九月间。夏季大黄发芽了，根茎内含的养料减少，所以不宜挖掘。秋季八、九月间因地下根茎细胞中所贮藏汁液量很丰富，有效成份的含量也最多。
    青海大黄不但在国内市场有广阔的销路，在国际市场上也享有很高的声誉。近几年来大黄在国际贸易上已有供不应求的趋势。国营贸易公司为了积极发展少数民族副业生产，增加收入，满足市场需要，在每年大黄生产季节，按着药粮比价合理的调整收购价格，并派人下乡指导少数民族提高生产。
