Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 4th — Japanese business circles stated in a report released on the 3rd by the Japan International Trade Promotion Association that, unless Japan exports more embargoed materials to China, Japan will certainly lose the Chinese market under the trade competition of Eastern and Western countries.

This report was submitted to the International Trade Promotion Association by the Japanese business delegation to China, who recently returned home. The association dispatched this delegation to visit China.

The delegation advocates that Japan launch a concerted movement to break the embargo barriers that bind Japan. The delegation pointed out in its report that Japan must quickly prepare to sign long-term contracts with China to sell construction machinery and equipment, including many embargoed materials.

The report said that Britain, a major member of the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM), has already signed contracts to ship trucks, tractors and cargo ships to China, all of which are embargoed materials that Japan has been cautious not to sell to China. The report also described the active export and negotiation of embargoed materials to China by France, West Germany, Switzerland and Belgium.

The Japan International Trade Promotion Association is scheduled to jointly discuss the issue of relaxing the embargo and expanding Sino-Japanese trade tomorrow with the Diet Members' League for Promoting Japan-China Trade, the Japan-China Import and Export Association and other economic organizations.

    日工商界要求打破禁运壁垒
    国际贸易促进协会大声疾呼扩大日中贸易
    新华社4日讯　东京消息：日本国际贸易促进协会3日发表一份报告说，除非日本向中国输出更多的禁运物资，日本在东西方国家的贸易竞争下一定会失去中国市场。
    这个报告是最近回国的日本工商界访华代表团向国际贸易促进协会提出的。协会派遣这个代表团在中国进行了访问。
    代表团主张日本发动一个协同一致的运动，打破束缚日本的禁运壁垒。代表团在它的报告中指出，日本必须迅速准备同中国签订长期合同，出售包括很多禁运物资在内的建设机械和设备。
    这份报告说，巴黎统筹委员会的主要会员国——英国，已经签订合同要把卡车、拖拉机和货船运往中国，而这些都是禁运物资，也是日本一直小心谨慎地不敢出售给中国的。报告还叙述了法国、西德、瑞士、比利时积极向中国输出和谈判输出禁运物资的情况。
    日本国际贸易促进协会定于明天同国会议员促进日中贸易联盟和日中输出入协会以及其他经济团体，共同讨论放宽禁运，扩大日中贸易问题。
