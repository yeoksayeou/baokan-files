Many Factories in Jiangsu Province's Local Industry
Actively Serve the Rural Economy

    (Our News) Jiangsu Province is one of the more industrially developed provinces in China's coastal area, especially with its developed textile and food industries, and the mechanical industry also has a certain technical foundation. Since the central government instructed that local industries should mainly serve the agricultural economy and be closely integrated with it, the production of many factories and mines in the province has begun to face the countryside. In the past year, the local industry of the province produced 440,000 pieces of various agricultural tools and supplied more than 400,000 tons of agricultural fertilizer, which strongly supported the agricultural cooperativization movement and the development of agricultural production. According to incomplete statistics from January to May this year, factories throughout the province repaired more than 1,200 double-wheeled double-shared plows, 460 water pumps, and more than 380,000 pieces of various small agricultural tools for farmers. In the second half of last year, county-run industries in Yangzhou, Suzhou, Zhenjiang, Songjiang and other regions also vigorously organized the work of processing agricultural products for farmers. Many oil and rice factories have changed the situation of insufficient production tasks in the past, where production was stopped for at least four months a year. According to statistics from 292 rice processing factories in eight counties of Suzhou region, they processed more than 274,000 tons of rice for farmers in the fourth quarter of last year, which not only generated processing fees of approximately 1.64 million yuan, but also increased state tax revenue by more than 5.495 million yuan. At the same time, it brought many benefits to farmers. Because machine processing has a higher rice yield than farmers' traditional methods, every 100 jin of rice yields four or five more jin of rice, thus producing an additional 133,000 tons of rice for farmers and saving more than 35.93 million labor days. From January to April this year, the Yizheng County Oil and Rice Factory in Yangzhou region processed a total of 210,000 jin of oil for farmers, producing 8,400 jin more oil than traditional oil extraction methods. The province has drawn out 5,000 horsepower engines to draw water for farmers, which can irrigate 250,000 mu of farmland. Rice factories in Jiading, Fengxian, Songjiang and other counties in the Songjiang area used more than 20 kinds of herbaceous plants such as rice straw, cotton boll husks, wheat straw, and daylily grass as raw materials to make pig feed, which on the one hand saved food and on the other hand solved the problem of insufficient feed. Local power plants throughout the province also actively organized power irrigation for farmland while ensuring industrial power consumption. They have newly built and expanded 314 special power irrigation lines in nine cities and counties in five regions of Suzhou, Zhenjiang, Yangzhou, Nantong, and Yancheng, which can meet the needs of more than 330,000 mu of farmland for irrigation and drainage. These efforts have brought many benefits to agricultural production and increased farmers' income.
    In addition, Jiangsu's local industry has also made many efforts in improving production management, improving product quality, increasing product output rate, saving raw materials, and trial-producing new products, which has also played an important role in supporting the development of agricultural production.

    江苏省地方工业中的许多工厂
    积极为农村经济服务
    本报讯　江苏省是我国沿海工业比较发达的省份之一，尤其是纺织、食品工业很发达，机械工业也具有一定的技术基础。自从中央指示了地方工业主要应为农业经济服务并同农业经济密切相结合的方针以后，省内许多厂矿的生产开始面向农村。在去年一年中，全省地方工业生产了各种农具达四十四万件，供应农肥达四十万吨以上，有力地支援了农业合作化运动和农业生产的发展。据今年1至5月的不完全统计，全省工厂共为农民修理双轮双铧犁一千二百多部，抽水机四百六十部，各种小农具达三十八万多件。去年下半年，在扬州、苏州、镇江、松江等专区的县营工业，还大力地组织了为农民加工农产品的工作，许多油米工厂改变了过去生产任务不足，一年生产至少要有四个月停工的状况。据苏州专区八个县二百九十二个加工米厂的统计，去年第四季度为农民加工稻谷二十七万四千多吨，不仅获得工缴收入约达一百六十四万多元，而且为国家增加了税收五百四十九万五千多元。同时给农民带来很好多处，因为机器加工比农民用土法加工出米率高，每一百斤稻谷要多出四、五斤米，因而又为农民多出大米十三万三千多吨，节省劳动日三千五百九十三万多个。扬州专区的仪征县油米厂今年1至4月共为农民加工油料二十一万斤，比土法榨油多出油八千四百斤。全省共抽出五千马力的引擎为农民戽水，可灌溉农田二十五万亩；在松江地区的嘉定、奉贤、松江等县的米厂，利用稻草、棉铃壳、麦秸、黄花草等二十多种草本植物作原料，制成了猪饲料，一方面节约了粮食，另方面解决了部分饲料不足的问题。全省地方电厂还在保证工业用电的前提下，积极组织为农田进行电力灌溉，已经在苏州、镇江、扬州、南通、盐城等五个专区九个市、县新建和扩建三百一十四条电力灌溉专用线，可供三十三万多亩农田灌溉和排水的需要。这些工作都给农业生产和增加农民收入方面带来了许多好处。
    此外，江苏地方工业还从改进生产管理、提高产品质量、提高产品出产率、节约原材料、试制新产品等方面作了许多努力，也对支援农业生产的发展起了重要作用。
