    A Unit with "Unclear Nature"
    In April 1954, the Tianjin Electrical Drive Complete Equipment Company was established by the Electrical Industry Bureau of the former First Ministry of Machine Building. However, the management structure of this company has not been determined to this day. The company's leaders have proposed more than five management plans, but every time they were sent to the Bureau, they "sank without a trace" and received no response.
    Because the management structure of the company has not been determined, many difficulties have arisen in the work. For example, when cadres want to apply for the agency's spare-time cultural school, they have to go through multiple negotiations to be allowed to apply as an agency. Because the unit's name contains the words "Company," the city telephone bill must be paid according to the company's regulations every month. It is understandable that other units do not understand the situation, but the Bureau itself has been very confused about the leadership of this company. For example, in July of last year, in order to unify the wage system for cadres and engineering technicians transferred from various places, we drafted a wage adjustment and promotion plan, but it was rejected by the Bureau with the reason that "your company is a government agency and is not suitable for adjustment at present." However, the Bureau always notifies us to "be sure to attend" every time it convenes enterprise meetings. This has left the company's leadership at a loss for a long time, and the business development has been very slow. In early July of this year, the Tianjin Wage Reform Committee deployed wage reform work for enterprises and agencies throughout the city, and our company also prepared for wage reform, but did not receive wage standards. The company sent people to the Bureau to ask for instructions, and the reply was: "The nature of the company is unclear, and the ministry has not instructed what standards to adjust wages according to." This has made it difficult for our company to carry out wage reform work.
    People have to ask: When will this unit with an "unclear nature" have a clear identity?　Yang Biao

### 一个“性质不明”的单位

    一个“性质不明”的单位
    1954年4月，原第一机械工业部电器工业管理局设立了天津电气传动成套设备公司。可是，这个公司的管理形式至今没有确定。这个公司的领导人员曾经先后提出五个以上的管理方案，但是送到管理局以后，每次都如“石沉大海”，没有反应。
    由于公司的管理形式没有确定，工作中发生了许多困难。如干部要报考机关业余文化学校，都要经过多次交涉才准按机关报考。因单位名称冠有“公司”二字，市内电话费每月非按企业规定缴纳不可。其他单位不了解情况，还情有可原，可是管理局本身对这个公司的领导也非常混乱。如去年7月为了把各地调来的干部和工程技术人员的工资制度统一起来，我们曾经拟订了一个调整工资和晋级方案，送到管理局以后，却被以“你公司是政府机关，目前不宜调整”为理由给驳回来了。但是，管理局每次召开企业会议，又都通知“务必参加”。这样，就使公司的领导长期无所适从，业务开展非常缓慢。今年7月初，天津市工资改革委员会布置全市企业、机关进行工资改革工作，我们公司也进行了工资改革的准备，但是没有接到工资标准。公司派人到管理局请示，答复又是：“公司性质不明，按何类标准调整工资，部里也没有指示。”这就使我们公司工资改革工作的进行发生了困难。
    人们要问：这个“性质不明”的单位，到什么时候才能有个明确的身份呢？　杨彪
