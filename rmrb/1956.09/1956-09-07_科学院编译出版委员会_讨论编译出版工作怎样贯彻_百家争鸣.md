Xinhua News Agency report: The Chinese Academy of Sciences Compilation and Publication Committee held a plenary meeting on the 5th to discuss how to implement the "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom" policy in compilation and publication work to serve scientific research.

Tao Menghe, Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Director of the Compilation and Publication Committee, presided over the discussion. Scientists and compilation and publication workers pointed out in their speeches that compilation and publication work is an important link in promoting academic prosperity and the "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom" policy; academic debate is first reflected in compilation and publication work. However, in the past, there were very few publications reflecting academic debates, and there was no active organization to publish scientific works from different schools of thought. In compilation and publication work, there is a kind of extreme thinking of absolute correctness or absolute error. On the selection criteria, the boundaries between academic and political matters are not clearly defined. In his speech, Zhao Zhongchi cited the number of scientific monographs from various countries compiled and published by the Science Press in the past six years as an example to illustrate that the above-mentioned one-sidedness also exists in the introduction of advanced science in the world. Everyone believes that all these pose great obstacles to academic prosperity.

In their speeches, everyone proposed that in order to implement the "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom" policy, compilation and publication work in the future must fully reflect the scientific research achievements of China and other countries in the world, as well as academic debates. On the selection of domestic scientific works for publication, authority should not be the standard, but academic value should be the standard. As long as the works are "reasonable and based on evidence," they can be published; even works with different ideological systems should have the opportunity to be published if they have certain value, but this does not mean that works with no academic value should be published uniformly.

During the discussion, everyone agreed that the review system for academic publications should be retained, but the sectarian bias in past reviews should be overcome. In the future, the role of members of the academic divisions of the Chinese Academy of Sciences should be fully utilized in the review process.

Participants in the discussion also raised many criticisms and suggestions regarding the work of the Science Press. They believe that improving compilation and publication work in the future must expand the scope of publication, increase the volume of publication, shorten the publication process, and establish an independent distribution agency for science and technology books and periodicals.

At the meeting, the twelve-year long-term compilation and publication plan for some natural sciences and social sciences was also discussed.

    讨论编译出版工作怎样贯彻“百家争鸣”
    新华社讯　中国科学院编译出版委员会在五日举行的全体会议上，讨论了编译出版工作如何贯彻“百家争鸣”方针为科学研究服务的问题。
    中国科学院副院长，编译出版委员会主任陶孟和主持了这次讨论会。科学家和编译出版工作者们在发言中指出，编译出版工作是繁荣学术，推动百家争鸣的重要环节；学术上的百家争鸣，首先反映在编译出版工作上。但是，过去出版物中反映学术争论的很少，也没有主动地组织出版不同学派的科学著作。在编译出版工作上，有一种绝对正确、或绝对错误的极端思想。在选题标准上，对学术与政治的界限划得不清。赵仲池在发言中，列举科学出版社六年来编译出版的各国科学专著的数量为例，说明在介绍世界先进科学上，同样存在着上述的片面性。大家认为，所有这些对繁荣学术都有很大障碍。
    大家在发言中提出，为了贯彻“百家争鸣”方针，今后编译出版工作，必须充分反映中国的和世界各国科学研究成果，以及学术上的争论。在对国内科学著作出版的选题上，不应以权威为标准，应以学术价值为标准，只要“言之成理，持之有故”的著作都可以出版；甚至不同思想体系的著作如果有一定的价值也应有出版的机会，但这并不是说毫无学术价值的著作都应当一律出版。
    讨论中大家都认为，对学术著作出版的审稿制度应该继续保留，但应克服过去在审稿上的宗派主义偏向。今后在审稿上应充分发挥中国科学院各学部委员的作用。
    参加讨论的人还对科学出版社的工作提出了许多批评和建议。他们认为改进今后编译出版工作必须扩大出版范围，增加出版量，缩短出版过程，建立科学技术书刊独立发行的机构。
    会上，并讨论了部分自然科学和社会科学的十二年编译出版远景规划等问题。
