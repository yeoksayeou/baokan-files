    Kunming Builds a New Equatorial Room
    (Our newspaper's dispatch from Kunming) The Kunming Station of the Purple Mountain Observatory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has built a new equatorial room on Phoenix Mountain in the eastern suburbs of Kunming. At this astronomical station, there is an equatorial instrument manufactured in East Germany for observing solar nucleons. This instrument is used for sky survey photography, and its primary mirror has a diameter of 10.5 centimeters, and the power is driven by gravity. The newly added equatorial instrument has a diameter of 13 centimeters and is powered by electricity. At present, the staff of the Kunming Astronomical Station are working day and night to carry out the observation of solar nucleons and sky survey photography.
