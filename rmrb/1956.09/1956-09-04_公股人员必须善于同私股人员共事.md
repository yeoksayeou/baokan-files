Public Shareholders Must Be Good at Working With Private Shareholders

Our capitalist industry and commerce have implemented full-industry public-private partnership. From 1956 onward, private shares in public-private joint ventures will be allocated profits according to the fixed interest rate method. These enterprises are now effectively under the direct management of the state. The capitalists and capitalist agents who were originally in the enterprises have become employees of the enterprises. The relationship between public and private personnel working in public-private joint ventures has thus become a relationship of co-working.

At present, capitalist personnel still maintain a certain degree of exploitation, and the capitalist traditions and habits in management of most of them have not been completely changed. Therefore, gradually transforming them through practical work remains a task that will take a considerable period.

The capitalist personnel of joint ventures belong to the national bourgeoisie; they are politically and economically different from the bureaucratic bourgeoisie. In the past, they struggled to survive and develop capitalist industry and commerce under the oppression of imperialism and the bureaucratic bourgeoisie. This shows that many of them possess considerable management capabilities and rich business experience, and many also possess modern scientific and technological knowledge. We should make full use of their experience and knowledge. This is beneficial to socialist construction.

In the past, the relationship between public and private personnel in public-private joint ventures was not very good, nor very bad, but generally ordinary. The performance of private personnel at work was also like this. The reason for this phenomenon is that both public and private personnel had concerns. The main concern of public personnel was the fear of losing their stand, and the main concern of private personnel was the fear of making mistakes. Not losing one's stand is something that every cadre should be wary of. However, it should be recognized that the Party and the state's policy of transforming capitalist industry and commerce is in line with the interests of the working class. As long as one acts in accordance with the policy, there will be no problem of losing one's stand. The Party committees and the working masses of the enterprises should support and help the public representatives act in accordance with the Party and the state's policies, and support the public representatives in doing a good job in their working relationship with private personnel. Private personnel have just become employees of joint ventures, and it is easy to understand that they are afraid of making mistakes. However, the question is not whether to be afraid of making mistakes, but what kind of mistakes to be afraid of making. If they are afraid of making mistakes that would corrupt public personnel and the working masses with bourgeois ideology, that is completely correct. They should be constantly vigilant against making such mistakes. If they make mistakes due to lack of experience in order to do a good job in the enterprise, then there is nothing to be afraid of. Anyone is bound to make such mistakes, and everyone grows up by constantly overcoming such mistakes.

In public-private joint ventures, working well with private personnel, uniting them, and gradually transforming them in practice is first and foremost the responsibility of the public representatives in the enterprise. At present, what should be paid attention to in this regard?

First, private personnel should have a job, power, and responsibility in their work positions. They should be boldly used, and helped to overcome difficulties and achieve results. This is the only way to overcome their passive dependence and establish a positive and responsible working attitude. If capitalist personnel make mistakes or have shortcomings, the leading organs and public representatives should sincerely point them out and help them correct them. Public personnel should not only help private personnel do their jobs well, but also learn from the strengths of private personnel.

Second, important work in the enterprise, especially issues related to enterprise reform, economic restructuring, major issues in production and operation, and major issues related to public-private relations, should earnestly implement the spirit of consultation and allow capitalist personnel to fully express their opinions, and even engage in necessary debates. Public representatives should not act arbitrarily, and private personnel should not be stubborn. Both parties should listen to each other's reasonable opinions and revise their own opinions so that consensus can be reached.

Consultation can take many forms, such as exchanging opinions individually, holding discussions among a few people, or consulting in the enterprise's democratic management committee. Exchanging opinions individually is a consultation method that can be used frequently by both public and private parties. This method can avoid some of the concerns of capitalist personnel and enable them to talk frankly. Private personnel should boldly express their opinions during consultations, and should also listen to the opinions of public representatives and the working masses. Only in this way can the relationship of cooperation and co-working between the public and private parties be enhanced.

Third, in order to enable capitalist personnel to carry out their work well within their division of labor, they should be allowed to read the documents they need to read within their scope of responsibility and participate in the meetings they should participate in within their scope of responsibility. Some business leading organs convene lower-level business units to hold meetings to discuss business and administrative issues, and only designate public representatives to participate, which is not in line with the administrative system; relevant private personnel should also be allowed to participate in the meeting according to their administrative positions.

Fourth, improve the relationship between employees and private personnel. In the past, because private personnel were the bosses and exploiters in the enterprise, the working masses had a negative feeling towards them, which has caused private personnel to encounter certain difficulties in their work now. Therefore, workers should be educated to understand the consistency between the Party's policy toward the bourgeoisie and the interests of the working class, and to understand that the working class should take on the important task of uniting, educating, and transforming the bourgeoisie with a positive attitude, and unite and cooperate with private personnel on the premise of drawing a clear line of demarcation in ideology, respect their powers, and help and support them in doing their jobs well. At the same time, capitalists should also be educated to actively approach the working masses, learn from the working masses, change their incorrect attitude toward workers, and conduct self-criticism to the working masses in a timely manner and in an appropriate manner to change the perceptions of the working masses.

Doing a good job in working relations with private personnel is the main issue in public-private relations after the full-industry public-private partnership. The Party committee of the joint venture must attach importance to this work, educate Party members, League members, cadres, and employees to implement the Party's policy toward the bourgeoisie, unite private personnel, strive to make private personnel gradually become workers in name and in fact, transform their dual working relationship with employees into a complete socialist cooperative and mutually supportive relationship, give play to all positive factors that are conducive to socialism, prevent negative factors that are detrimental to socialism, and promote the smooth advancement of the socialist revolution.

### 公股人员必须善于同私股人员共事

    公股人员必须善于同私股人员共事
    我国的资本主义工商业已经实行全行业公私合营，从1956年起，公私合营企业中的私股都要按照资本定息的办法分配利润。这些企业实际上已由国家直接管理。原来在企业中的资本家和资本家代理人已经成为企业的工作人员。在公私合营企业中工作的公私双方人员的关系，也就变成了共事的关系。
    目前资方人员还保持着一定的剥削，他们之中的大多数人员在经营管理上的资本主义的传统和习惯还没有完全改变，因此，在工作的实践中逐步对他们进行人的改造，还是一个相当长时期的任务。
    合营企业的资方人员，属于民族资产阶级；他们在政治上和经济上都不同于官僚资产阶级。过去他们在帝国主义、官僚资产阶级的压迫下挣扎图存，发展了资本主义工商业，这说明他们当中的许多人具有相当的经营能力和丰富的业务经验，有不少人还具有现代的科学技术知识。我们应该充分地使用他们这些经验和知识。这对社会主义建设是有利的。
    过去公私合营企业中公方人员和私方人员的关系，好的不多，坏的也不多，一般是平常的。私方人员在工作中的表现也是这样。造成这种现象的原因是公方人员和私方人员都有顾虑。公方人员主要的顾虑是怕丧失立场，私方人员主要的顾虑是怕犯错误。不要丧失立场，是每一个干部应该警惕的。但是，应该认识，党和国家对资本主义工商业的改造政策，是符合工人阶级利益的，只要按照政策办事，就不会发生丧失立场的问题。企业的党委和工人群众应该支持和帮助公股代表按照党和国家的政策办事，支持公股代表搞好同私方人员的工作关系。私方人员刚刚成为合营企业的工作人员，害怕犯错误，这是容易理解的。但是，问题不在于是不是怕犯错误，而是看怕犯什么样的错误。如果是怕犯用资产阶级思想意识腐蚀公方人员和工人群众的错误，那是完全正确的。他们应该时刻警惕不要犯这样的错误。如果为了把企业中的工作做好，因为缺乏经验而犯了错误，这就没有什么可怕的。任何人都难免犯这种错误，每个人都是在不断克服这种错误中成长起来的。
    在公私合营企业中，同私方人员很好地共事，团结他们，在实践中逐步改造他们，这首先是企业中公股代表的责任。在目前，从这方面应该注意做些什么呢？
    第一、应该在工作职务上使私方人员有职有权有责，大胆使用他们，帮助他们克服困难，作出成绩。这样才能克服他们的消极依赖思想，树立积极负责的工作态度。资方人员如果发生了错误和缺点，领导机关和公方代表应该诚恳地给他们指出，帮助他们改正。公方人员一方面应帮助私方人员做好工作，另一方也要向私方人员学习其特长。
    第二、企业中的重要工作，特别是有关企业改革、经济改组和生产经营中的重大问题、有关公私关系的重大问题的处理，应该认真贯彻协商办事的精神，让资方人员充分发表意见，甚至展开必要的争论。公方代表不能独断独行，资方人员也不要固持己见，双方都要听取对方合理的意见，修正自己的意见，这样就可以取得意见一致。
    协商可以采取多种的方式，个别交换意见，少数人进行座谈，在企业的民主管理委员会中进行协商，都是可以做的。个别交换意见是公私双方可以经常运用的协商方式，这种方式可以避免资方人员的一些顾虑，使他们能够倾心相谈。私方人员在协商的时候，应该大胆提出自己的意见，同时也应该倾听公方代表和工人群众的意见。只有这样才能增强公私双方合作共事的关系。
    第三、为了使资方人员在分工范围内能够很好地进行工作，应该让他们批阅他们职责范围内所需要批阅的文件，参加他们职责范围内应该参加的会议。有些业务领导机关召集下级业务单位开会讨论业务和行政问题，只指定公股代表参加，这是不合行政制度的；应该按照行政职务，也让有关的私方人员参加会议。
    第四、改进职工和私方人员的关系。过去，由于私方人员在企业中是老板，是剥削者，工人群众对他们是有反感的，这就使私方人员现在在工作中遇到了一定的困难。因此应该教育工人，使他们了解党对资产阶级的政策和工人阶级利益的一致性，说明工人阶级应该用积极的态度，把团结、教育、改造资方人员的重大任务担当起来，在划清思想界限的前提下，和私方人员团结合作，尊重他们的职权，并且帮助、支持他们做好工作。同时还要教育资本家主动地接近工人群众，向工人群众学习，改变自己对于工人的不正确的态度，要在适当时机采用适当方式，向工人群众进行自我批评，以改变工人群众的观感。
    同私方人员搞好工作关系是全行业公私合营以后公私关系的主要问题。合营企业党委一定要重视这项工作，教育党员、团员、干部和职工贯彻执行党对资产阶级的政策，团结私方人员，争取私方人员逐步地变成名副其实的劳动者，使他们同职工之间从两重性的工作关系变成完全的社会主义的合作互助关系，发挥一切有利于社会主义的积极因素，防止不利于社会主义的消极因素，推动社会主义革命事业顺利前进。
