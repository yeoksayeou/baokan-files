Xinhua News Agency report: On September 28, at the meeting celebrating the 7th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China held in the Column Hall of the Trade Union Building in Moscow by the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, the Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, and the Soviet Ministry of Culture, Soviet Communist Party Central Committee Secretary Aristov delivered a report on the 7th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

Aristov said that seven years have passed since the heroic Chinese people, under the leadership of their glorious Communist Party, achieved a historically significant great victory over the feudal reactionaries and imperialism, and established their own powerful, truly people's independent state—the People's Republic of China.

Since then, the people of the countries in the socialist camp and all peace-loving people in the world have widely celebrated this significant day with the Chinese people, regarding it as one of the joyous festivals of human liberation.

On the occasion of the victory of the Chinese revolution and the 7th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Soviet people extend their warmest congratulations to their loyal friends and comrades-in-arms—the great Chinese people, and wish them new achievements in socialist construction.

Aristov said that the founding of the People's Republic of China is the result of the long-term selfless struggle of the Chinese people and their Communist Party, and the fruit of the victory of the great people's revolution. The longer the time since the day of the Chinese people's revolution, the more fully and comprehensively its historical significance to the world and its great impact on the development of history can be seen.

After the great October Socialist Revolution, the victory of the Chinese people's revolution and the founding of the People's Republic of China are the most prominent events, which have had a significant impact on the development of the liberation struggle in the Eastern countries and the entire course of world history. Progressive humanity has reason to believe that the victory of the Chinese people's revolution is one of the most important stages on the road to the universal victory of the great cause of peace, democracy, and socialism.

Aristov said that the victory of the people's revolution marked the beginning of a new era in the lives of 600 million Chinese people. It liberated their inexhaustible creativity and guided them onto the broad road of socialist construction. After becoming masters of their own country and controlling their own destiny, the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, have achieved brilliant victories in economic, cultural, and national construction in a short period of time.

The Eighth National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party summarized the profound socialist transformation implemented by the Chinese people in an unprecedentedly short period. The Soviet people and the people of all countries in the world paid close attention to the work of this congress.

This congress is not only a major event in the lives of the Chinese people but also an important milestone in the development of the entire international communist and workers' movement. The congress summarized the accumulated experience and formulated an inspiring program for further socialist construction. There is no doubt that the resolutions of this congress will further unite all the forces of the Chinese people to strive for the building of a great socialist China.

The conclusions made by the congress based on the development of the Chinese revolution regarding the conditions for revolutionary victory and the ways and methods for carrying out socialist transformation in China are a major contribution to the theory of Marxism-Leninism and a very valuable experience for fraternal communist and workers' parties.

Aristov said that the victory of the Chinese people once again vividly demonstrates the victory of Marxism-Leninism. The Chinese Communist Party skillfully applied Marxism-Leninism in the practice of socialist construction and advanced unswervingly towards the goals that had been set. The CPC Central Committee, following the theory of Marxism-Leninism, creatively applied the historical experience of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries to the specific conditions of its own country, and formulated the general line for the transition period based on its own rich experience accumulated in the course of the great Chinese revolution.

The Chinese Communist Party, its Central Committee, and the outstanding Marxist-Leninist Comrade Mao Zedong creatively treated the issue of solving the transition to socialism, enriching the scientific socialist theory and practice on the transformation of society on the basis of socialism.

The Chinese Communist Party's experience in establishing correct relations between the working class and the national bourgeoisie is of extreme importance for the socialist transformation work of other countries.

Aristov then spoke in detail about the great victory of China's socialist transformation and the achievements made in developing industrial and agricultural production and transportation in recent years, as well as the development prospects during the Second Five-Year Plan. He said that the achievements made by Chinese friends in developing their national economy mean that the time is not far off when China will become a powerful socialist industrial country with a highly developed modern industry and socialist agriculture equipped with advanced technology.

The outstanding achievements made by the Chinese people in socialist construction, and the far-sighted foreign policy of the Chinese government based on the consistent struggle for lasting peace and international friendship, have given the People's Republic of China a high reputation and earned the deep respect of the people of all peace-loving countries. After the victory of the people's revolution, China has occupied the position in international relations that this great country should occupy.

Lenin once foresaw that the great Chinese people would play an outstanding role in the destiny of mankind and on the road to socialism. At present, as the East awakens and moves towards a new life, we clearly see that a free China that confidently builds socialism under complex and unique conditions and resolutely struggles for lasting world peace is such a great attraction for the people who are gradually liberated from colonial oppression.

Aristov said that peace-loving people deeply know how important a role the People's Republic of China played in eliminating the hotbed of war danger in Korea and restoring peace in Indochina. The famous Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence put forward by People's China and India have been highly praised by the people of all countries and are being increasingly widely recognized in current international life.

Peace-loving people have duly assessed China's constructive role in the historically significant Bandung Conference and its efforts to expand trust and cooperation between Asian and African countries with different social systems. The Chinese people, together with all peace-loving people, support the Egyptian government's completely legitimate action of nationalizing the Suez Canal. The Chinese government, like the governments of all peace-loving countries, resolutely opposes the provocative policies of exerting pressure on Egypt and advocates a peaceful solution to the Suez Canal issue.

People's China is a great peace-loving country. Without its participation, no major international issue in modern times can be resolved, no matter which region of the world these issues involve. The People's Republic of China's international ties are expanding day by day, its international prestige is constantly increasing, and its influence on the development of the international situation is also constantly improving. There is no doubt that restoring the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations will make the work of this important international organization more effective.

Aristov said that the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China are brotherly countries, countries with common ideals. The friendship between the people of our two countries, like the friendship between the people of all countries in the socialist friendly family, is built on the basis of complete equality, mutual respect for national interests, close concern for the prosperity of each socialist country, and the consolidation of the entire socialist camp. This relationship vividly embodies the spirit of proletarian internationalism. The Soviet Union and China have established extensive ties in economic relations and mutual assistance, which have increased the productive forces of the two countries, developed the cultures of the two countries, and enriched each other's experiences. The Soviet Union will continue to regard doing its best to help the People's Republic of China build a new life as its international obligation.

He said that the characteristics of our era are the existence of the world socialist system, the vigorous development of the national liberation movement leading to the collapse of the imperialist colonial system, and the unwavering desire of the people of all countries for peace. All of this creates real conditions for preventing war and consolidating peace. The recent international tension has greatly eased. However, we must never relax our vigilance or slacken the struggle for peace. In order to consolidate peace, we must do our best to develop the friendship between our socialist countries, strengthen the powerful camp of peace, democracy, and socialism, and develop and consolidate relations with all peace-loving countries.

Aristov finally wished the eternal friendship between the people of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China to be continuously consolidated and developed!

    苏共中央书记阿里斯托夫在大会上作报告
    据新华社讯　9月28日，在全苏工会中央理事会、苏联对外文化协会和苏联文化部在莫斯科工会大厦圆柱大厅举行庆祝中华人民共和国成立七周年的大会上，苏联共产党中央委员会书记阿里斯托夫作了关于中华人民共和国成立七周年的报告。
    阿里斯托夫说，自从英勇的中国人民在自己光荣的共产党的领导下，取得了对封建反动派和帝国主义的具有历史意义的伟大胜利，建立了自己强大的、真正人民的独立国家——中华人民共和国以来，已经七年过去了。
    从那个时候起，社会主义阵营各国人民、世界上一切热爱和平的人都同中国人民一起广泛地庆祝这个意义重大的日子，认为它是人类解放的愉快节日之一。
    在中国革命胜利和中华人民共和国成立七周年的时候，苏联人民向自己忠实的朋友和战友——伟大的中国人民致以最热烈的祝贺，并且预祝他们在社会主义建设中获得新的成就。
    阿里斯托夫说，中华人民共和国的成立，是中国人民和他们的共产党长时期忘我斗争的结果，是伟大的人民革命胜利的果实。从中国人民革命胜利的日子起，时间越久就越能充分地和全面地看出这一胜利对全世界的历史意义，它对历史发展的巨大影响。
    在伟大的十月社会主义革命以后，中国的人民革命的胜利和中华人民共和国的成立是最突出的事件，它对东方各国解放斗争的发展和世界历史的整个进程都产生了重大的影响。进步人类有理由认为，中国人民革命的胜利是在争取和平、民主和社会主义的伟大事业普遍胜利的道路上的最重要的阶段之一。
    阿里斯托夫说，人民革命的胜利标志了六亿中国人民的生活上的新纪元的开端。它解放了他们的无穷尽的创造力，引导他们走上了社会主义建设的康庄大道。中国人民成为自己国家的主人和掌握了自己的命运以后，在中国共产党的领导之下短期内取得了经济、文化和国家建设各方面的辉煌胜利。
    中国共产党第八次全国代表大会总结了中国人民在空前未有的短期中所实行的深刻的社会主义改造，苏联人民以及世界各国人民都密切注意了这次代表大会的工作。
    这次大会不但是中国人民生活中的一件大事，而且是整个国际共产主义运动和工人运动发展的一个重要的里程碑。这次代表大会总结了所累积的经验和拟定了鼓舞人心的进一步建设社会主义的纲领。毫无疑问，这次代表大会的决议将更加团结中国人民的一切力量去为建成伟大的社会主义中国而奋斗。
    代表大会根据中国革命的发展所作出的关于革命胜利的条件以及关于中国进行社会主义改造的途径和方法的结论，是对马克思列宁主义的理论的一个重大贡献，对兄弟共产党和工人党来说是一个非常宝贵的经验。
    阿里斯托夫说，中国人民的胜利再一次鲜明地表明马克思列宁主义的胜利。中国共产党在社会主义建设的实践中巧妙地运用了马克思列宁主义，向着已经提出的目标确信不移地前进，中共中央遵循马克思列宁主义的理论，一方面创造性地把苏联、各社会主义国家的历史经验运用到本国的具体条件中，同时根据在伟大的中国革命过程中积累起来的自己的丰富的经验，制定了过渡时期的总路线。
    中国共产党、它的中央委员会和杰出的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东同志创造性地对待解决向社会主义
  过渡的问题，丰富了关于在社会主义的基础上改造社会的科学社会主义理论和实践。
    中国共产党在建立工人阶级同民族资产阶级的正确关系方面的工作经验对其他国家的社会主义改造工作具有极重要的意义。
    阿里斯托夫接着详细谈到了中国社会主义改造的伟大胜利和最近几年在发展工、农业生产、交通运输方面所取得的成就，以及在第二个五年计划期间的发展远景。他说，中国朋友在发展本国的国民经济中所获得的成就意味着，中国成为一个具有高度发达的现代化工业、用先进的技术装备起来的社会主义农业的强大社会主义工业国家的时候已经不远了。
    中国人民在社会主义建设中所获得的卓越成就，中国政府以一贯争取持久和平和国际友谊的斗争作为基础的具有远见的外交政策，使得中华人民共和国获得高度的威信，受到一切爱好和平国家的人民的深深的尊敬。在人民革命胜利以后，中国在国际关系中占有了这个大国所应当占有的地位。
    列宁曾经预见到伟大的中国人民将在人类的命运中、在人类走向社会主义的道路上起杰出的作用。目前，当东方觉醒起来走向新生活的时候，我们清楚地看到，在复杂和独特的情况下满怀信心地建设社会主义的、坚决地为争取持久世界和平而斗争的自由中国，对那些陆续从殖民压迫下解放出来的人民是一支那么大的吸引力量。
    阿里斯托夫说，爱好和平的人们深深知道，中华人民共和国在消除朝鲜的战争危险策源地和恢复印度支那地区的和平中起了多么重大的作用。人民中国和印度提出的著名的和平共处五项原则受到各国人民高度的评价，并且在目前国际生活中得到越来越广泛的承认。
    爱好和平的人们对中国在有历史意义的万隆会议上的建设性作用，对它在扩大社会制度不同的亚非国家之间的信任和合作方面所作的努力作了应有的评价。中国人民同一切爱好和平的人一道，支持埃及政府把苏伊士运河收归国有的完全合法的行动。中国政府和一切爱好和平国家的政府一样，坚决反对向埃及施加压力的挑衅政策，主张和平解决苏伊士运河问题。
    人民中国是一个爱好和平的大国。如果没有它参加，在现代就不能解决任何一个重大的国际问题，不管这些问题牵涉的是世界哪一个地区。中华人民共和国的国际联系在日益扩大，它的国际威望在不断增加，它对国际局势的发展所起的影响也在不断提高。毫无疑问，恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法权利会使这一重要的国际组织的工作更有成效。
    阿里斯托夫说，苏联和中华人民共和国是兄弟国家，是志同道合的国家。我们两国人民之间的友谊同社会主义友好大家庭中的各国人民之间的友谊一样是建筑在完全平等、互相尊重国家利益、密切关心各个社会主义国家的繁荣和整个社会主义阵营的巩固的基础上的。这种关系生动的体现了无产阶级国际主义精神。苏联和中国在经济关系上和互助上建立了广泛的联系，这种互助提高了两国的生产力，发展了两国的文化，彼此丰富了经验。苏联今后仍把尽力帮助中华人民共和国建设新生活看作是自己的国际义务。
    他说，我们时代的特点是世界社会主义体系的存在、导致帝国主义殖民体系崩溃的民族解放运动的蓬勃发展、各国人民始终不移地向往和平。所有这一切都为防止战争和巩固和平创造了现实的条件。近来国际紧张局势已经有了很大的缓和。但是，我们绝不能放松警惕性，放松争取和平的斗争。为了巩固和平，我们必须尽力发展我们社会主义国家之间的友谊，加强强大的和平、民主和社会主义阵营，发展和巩固同一切爱好和平国家之间的关系。
    阿里斯托夫最后祝苏联和中华人民共和国两国人民永恒的友谊不断巩固和发展！
