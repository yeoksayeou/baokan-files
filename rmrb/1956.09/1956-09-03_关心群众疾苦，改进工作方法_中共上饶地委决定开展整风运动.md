Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, September 2nd: The CCP Jiangxi Provincial Shangrao Local Committee, after a comprehensive discussion and study of the ideological style of the current rural party members and cadres, decided to launch a movement to care about the people's lives and sufferings and improve working methods throughout the region, in order to further strengthen the relationship between party members, cadres, and the masses.

　　A month ago, the CCP Shangrao Prefectural Committee conducted a special investigation into the ideological style of party members and cadres. According to the investigation, the prefectural committee believes that the vast majority of cadres have achieved great work achievements in leading and uniting the masses, but after the successful realization of agricultural cooperativization in the region, party members and cadres are developing a work style of commandism and bureaucracy. Many cadres do not understand the situation of the masses, do not care about the people's suffering, excessively emphasize collective interests, disregard and infringe on the individual interests of commune members, and replace meticulous ideological work with crude methods. Many cadres of agricultural production cooperatives are using economic means such as deducting work points to force commune members to obey their decisions, which has become a trend. Some cadres even treat commune members by holding struggle sessions and writing self-criticisms, and the illegal and undisciplined behavior of individual cadres is even more serious. As a result, the democratic atmosphere in many agricultural production cooperatives is weak, and even many commune members dare not offer opinions to party members and cadres.

　　The prefectural committee believes that the reason for the above problems is that the ideological style of many cadres still retains the patriarchal style generated on the basis of the small-scale peasant economy. In the past, for a single family, the patriarch could dominate everything. Now, some people have become cadres, and they have to lead an agricultural cooperative of hundreds or thousands of households, with countless tasks and few solutions. Therefore, they habitually use the patriarchal method, resulting in commandism. In addition, some cadres believe that after cooperativization, the socialist consciousness of the masses has greatly improved, so they can ignore or relax ideological work. The bureaucracy and subjectivism of higher-level leading organs are also one of the reasons for commandism.

　　After analyzing the current situation and reasons, the prefectural committee decided to launch a movement to care about the people's lives and sufferings and improve working methods in September, first through a universal rectification method from top to bottom and from bottom to top. The prefectural committee also determined that this rectification will be carried out in two batches. In the first batch, when the counties of the Shangrao Prefecture recently convene cadre conferences, the main township and cooperative cadres who are separated from production will be concentrated in the county. Through studying documents and summarizing work, they will start by examining the care for the people's lives and sufferings, and find out the root causes of errors and shortcomings. The second batch, under the guidance of county party committee members dividing up the areas, will conduct rectification work and ideological style for all party members and cadres above the production team leader of the cooperative, with the township as the unit. After the general cadres of the townships and cooperatives have undergone preliminary rectification, they will generally convene commune member representative conferences to fully promote democracy, mobilize commune members to offer opinions, inspect cooperative affairs work, and develop rationalization proposals, so as to combine the rectification of cadres' ideological style with the improvement of practical work and the promotion of production. At the commune member representative conference, commune members should be able to speak freely, and party members and cadres should humbly listen to opinions. They should respond to and explain the criticisms and opinions raised by commune members, and formulate improvement measures. If the cadres of individual agricultural production cooperatives have serious errors and particularly bad work styles, the management committee should be re-elected according to the opinions of the commune members. At the same time as the rectification, cadres should also be universally organized to conduct home visits, help the masses solve specific difficulties in their lives, so as to further strengthen the connection between party members, cadres, and the masses, and improve working methods.

    关心群众疾苦，改进工作方法
    中共上饶地委决定开展整风运动
    新华社南昌2日电　中共江西省上饶地方委员会在全盘讨论和研究了当前农村党员、干部的思想作风的情况以后，决定要在全区范围内开展一次关心群众生活和疾苦、改进工作方法的运动，以进一步密切党员、干部同群众的关系。
    一个月以前，中共上饶地委曾对党员、干部的思想作风进行专门调查。根据调查的情况，地委认为广大干部在领导和团结群众方面是取得了巨大的工作成就的，但是全区在胜利实现农业合作化以后，党员、干部正在滋长着强迫命令和官僚主义的工作作风。不少干部不了解群众情况，不关心群众疾苦，过分强调集体利益，漠视和侵犯社员的个人利益，并且以粗暴的办法来代替细致的思想工作。不少农业生产合作社的干部，用扣工分等经济上的手段强迫社员服从自己的决定，已经形成一种风气。有些干部还以开斗争会、写悔过书等办法来对待社员，个别干部违法乱纪的情况更为严重。因此，有许多农业生产合作社的民主空气薄弱，甚至不少社员不敢给党员、干部提意见。
    地委认为，产生上述问题的原因是由于许多干部的思想作风中还保存着在小农经济基础上产生的家长制作风。过去，一家一户，家长可以主宰一切。现在有一些人已成为干部，他们要领导一个数百户、千余户的农业社，工作千头万绪，不易摆布，而办法又很少。因此，他们就习惯地搬用了家长制的办法，造成强迫命令。另外，也有若干干部认为合作化后，群众的社会主义觉悟已经有很大提高，就可以不问或放松思想工作。上层领导机关的官僚主义和主观主义也是造成强迫命令的原因之一。
    地委在分析了当前情况和原因后，决定在9月份首先通过自上而下、自下而上普遍整风的办法，来开展关心群众的生活和疾苦，改进工作方法的运动。地委还确定这次整风分两批进行。第一批，在最近上饶专区各县召开干部大会时，把脱离生产的乡、社主要干部集中到县，通过学习文件、总结工作，从检查关心群众生活和疾苦入手，找出产生错误和缺点的根源。第二批将在县委委员分片指导下，以乡为单位，对全体党员和合作社生产队长以上干部，进行整顿工作和思想作风。乡、社一般干部经过初步整顿后，将普遍召开社员代表大会，充分发扬民主，发动社员提意见，检查社务工作，开展合理化建议，以把整顿干部思想作风同改进实际工作、推动生产结合起来。在社员代表大会上，应该使社员做到畅所欲言，党员和干部应虚心听取意见。对社员提出的批评和意见，要作出答复和交代，并订出改进办法。个别农业生产合作社的干部错误严重、作风特别恶劣，就应根据社员意见，改选管理委员会。在整风的同时，还要普遍组织干部进行家庭访问，帮助群众解决生活中的具体困难，以进一步密切党员、干部同群众的联系，改进工作方法。
