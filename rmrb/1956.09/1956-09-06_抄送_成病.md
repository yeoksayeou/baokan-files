    "CC-ing" Becomes a Disease
    Bi Ting
    Copying documents used to be a good thing, as it allowed other relevant departments to understand the relevant situation in addition to the two departments involved. This is very necessary today, when the division of labor and cooperation in socialist construction is becoming closer and more complex.
    However, the problem is that some units are issuing and copying indiscriminately without control: many unnecessary copies are being made. For example, in order to request the Jinan Municipal Light Industry Bureau to assist in completely solving the sales problem of soap, the Jinan Chemical Plant sent a report to a total of seventeen departments, from the Tianqiao District Committee of Jinan City to the State Council. Among them, the business of units such as the Supreme People's Procuratorate, the Shandong Provincial People's Procuratorate, and the Jinan Municipal People's Procuratorate has absolutely nothing to do with the "soap sales" problem, but they were also copied. As another example, the Acheng Sugar Factory in Heilongjiang Province submitted a plan task book to the Provincial Department of Industry and the Sugar Industry Company for approval to expand the second workshop. The written description, including tables, totaled twenty-five pages of eight-open rough-edged paper, plus four large blueprints, a thick volume, which was also copied to eleven departments, of which at least two departments had "less relationship" and could have been omitted. Not only are grassroots units like this, but even some departments and bureaus of central agencies are like this. Following the example of their superiors, the trend of blindly "CC-ing" has become more and more prevalent.
    With such copying back and forth, not to mention how much manpower and material resources the issuing unit has to spend to send out so many copies. Let's first look at the receiving units. They are forced to increase a lot of extra burden. Not only does it increase the workload of the staff who receive, register, and distribute documents, but cadres also have to take some time to read these documents. Even if some copies are simply not read, a series of procedures for filing and registering must be carried out. Finally, a batch of wooden cabinets and safes must be added to let these "copies" sleep.
    Comrades may ask, why do these units do things that are not beneficial to anyone? Their answers are still justified: "Copying documents to more departments can allow more departments to understand the relevant situation, which can attract more attention and supervision, and problems can be solved more easily." In fact, their ideas are wrong. The key to truly solving problems lies in finding the superior authority that directly leads you or finding the department that has a direct relationship with your own business, because only the superior authority that directly leads you understands your actual situation best. If they can't solve it, then they have the responsibility to report and ask for instructions from higher-level authorities; similarly, only departments that have a direct relationship with your own business have close vested interests. Through specific and practical consultation and research between the two parties, problems can be solved most quickly and thoroughly. Therefore, there are indeed many units that understand this truth. For example, in order to solve the sales difficulties of the Shanghai Soap Industry, the Shanghai Oils and Fats Food Industry Company only copied its report to the Food Industry Bureau of the Ministry of Food Industry to the three soap factories under its jurisdiction and one or two other departments with direct business connections.
    It can be said that those unnecessary document copies, in addition to fostering bureaucracy and wasting national manpower and material resources, have no other benefits. I hope those units that are obsessed with document "CC-ing" will wake up!

### “抄送”成病

    “抄送”成病
    毕挺
    文件抄送本来是一件好事，除当事的两个部门外，可以让其他有关部门也了解到有关情况。这在社会主义建设事业的分工协作关系更加密切、更加复杂的今天，是很必要的。
    但是问题在于有些单位不加控制地滥发滥抄：有许多不必要抄的抄了。例如：济南化工厂为了请求济南市轻工业管理局协助彻底解决肥皂的销售问题，一个报告共抄送了十七个部门，下自济南市天桥区委，上则一直到国务院。其中如最高人民检察院，山东省人民检察院、济南市人民检察院等等单位的业务和“肥皂销售”问题实在是风马牛不相及，但是也给抄送了。再如黑龙江阿城制糖厂报请省工业厅和制糖工业公司审批扩建第二车间的计划任务书，文字说明连表格共计八开的毛边纸二十五页，另有四大幅蓝图，厚厚的一大本，也抄送了十一个部门，其中至少有两个部门也是“关系较少”可以不抄送。不但基层单位是如此，甚至中央机关的有些部和局也是如此。上行下效，于是盲目“抄送”之风就愈来愈盛了。
    这样的抄来抄去，且不说发文单位发出这么多份数的抄件，要多花费多少人力和物力。先看看收文单位吧，他们被迫增加了大量的额外负担，不但要增加收文登记、批分文件工作人员的工作量，还得有干部腾出一部分时间来看这些文件，即使有些抄件干脆不看，那么，归档、立案一连串的手续也非办理不可，最后还要添置一批木橱、保险柜来让这些“抄件”睡觉。
    同志们要问，这些单位为什么要做这种对人对己都没有好处的事呢？他们的回答还是振振有词的：“文件抄送给更多的部门，可以让更多的部门了解到有关的情况，从而可以引起多方面的关怀和督促，问题解决起来就容易。其实，他们的想法错了。要想真正解决问题，关键在于找直接领导自己的上级机关或找与本身业务有直接联系的部门，因为只有直接领导的上级最了解自己的实际情况，如果他也解决不了，那么，他有责任向更上级的机关去反映和请示；同样的，也只有与自己的业务有直接联系的部门，才有密切的利害关系，通过双方的具体、切实地协商研究，解决问题最迅速、最彻底。因此，也确实有不少单位是懂得这个道理的。如上海油脂食品工业公司为了解决上海制皂工业销售困难问题报送食品工业部食品工业管理局的报告，只抄送了所属的三个肥皂厂和其他一二个有直接业务联系的部门。
    可以这样说，那些不必要的公文抄送，除了助长文牍主义和浪费国家的人力、物力外，没有其他任何好处。但愿那些醉心于文件“抄送”的单位醒醒吧！
