At two o'clock in the morning on August 5th, the Cao River swelled violently. A certain training regiment of the Hebei Military Region received an urgent notice that more than three million jin of grain at a grain warehouse near the Caohe Railway Station in XuShui County needed to be rescued immediately. Regiment Commander Zhang Jin immediately ordered all officers and soldiers of the Third and Thirteenth Companies to set off at the fastest speed to rescue the grain, and he personally went to the scene to command.

The soldiers of the two companies were awakened from their sleep and immediately assembled, marching rapidly towards their destination. The rain kept falling. On the thirty-li muddy road, people fell and got up again one after another in the darkness. The soldiers' feet sank into the mud, and they simply threw away their shoes. The sharp stones beside the railway pierced into the soldiers' soles, and some were cut and bleeding. However, no one fell behind.

Arriving at Caohe Railway Station, the east was faintly dawning. A field of yellow and turbid water submerged the crops, and a few sparse sorghum ears were exposed on the water surface. More than twenty tall grain stacks were soaked in more than two feet of muddy water, and the walls of the grain depot had long been washed away by the water. The soldiers' hearts tightened, and they couldn't wait for a moment, they had to rescue every grain of food.

The tense battle began, and heavy difficulties needed to be overcome. How could the grain be transported across the water surface, which was more than one person deep? Whether it was a wooden raft or a dustpan tied with wooden strips, it would still sink when loaded with grain. Finally, it was decided to build a pontoon bridge. First, the sleepers piled beside the railway were bundled into rectangular piers, but the buoyancy of the water was too great, and the piers could not sink. So the soldiers climbed onto the wooden piers and pressed down, some holding the edges tightly with both hands and pressing down hard, and then erecting thick electric wire poles. Wood was continuously transported from the shore to the water surface. Transporting wood on the water was an arduous task: some tied several pieces of wood together and pushed them forward with their hands, and then swam forward themselves; some paddled with one hand and pushed the wood with the other, and when they were tired, they lay on the wood to rest; sometimes the wood suddenly turned over, and people were pressed to the bottom of the water, but after a while, their tenacious heads popped out of the water again and continued to push forward. Jia Jingcai of the first platoon of the Thirteenth Company was not allowed to go into the water because of his weak health, but he resolutely requested to participate in transporting wood on the water. He said: "It's good even if I only transport one piece at a time. Seeing that the grain that the people have worked so hard to grow is about to be swallowed by the flood, how can I feel at ease doing light work? No matter what, saving grain is the most important thing." In this way, he and his comrades persisted in the water for eight hours.

Something that no one had noticed happened: the sleepers were originally coated with a new layer of black asphalt, which stained people's faces and bodies and felt as hot as a burn. The rain had stopped at some point, and the sun shone on the red and swollen skin, burning painfully. But no one wanted to go down at this moment.

At more than four o'clock in the afternoon, the two bridges were successively erected. The injured soldiers were mobilized to go back, and new companies were constantly transferred to rescue the grain. Tables, chairs, and door panels were quickly filled between the grain stacks, and the soldiers climbed onto the tall grain stacks like tigers. Immediately, shoveling grain, filling bags, carrying, sewing bags, and stacking bags, every link was organized and active. Most of the soldiers of the Second Company who had just been transferred were young men who had left school not long ago and had not experienced such training, but no one wanted to fall behind in the sacred task of rescuing the state's valuable property. The strong ones carried two bags at a time; those who could only carry one bag jogged, trying to shorten the transportation time as much as possible. In this way, people flowed endlessly, carrying bags of grain from the west side of the bridge to the east side of the bridge.

The grain stacks gradually shrank, the scars on the soldiers' bodies gradually increased, some had red and swollen shoulders, some had sore backs and couldn't straighten up, some were dizzy, and some had their hands and feet rubbed raw. However, no one wanted to go to the rest shed to rest. Zhang Lingzhen, the squad leader of the seventh squad of the Second Company, was a new soldier who had just joined the army this year. He fainted twice due to overwork, and after waking up, he still ignored the hygienist's advice and rushed up to carry grain.

The heroic song of "Crossing the Dadu River by Force" resounded from the loudspeaker on the construction site, and the tired faces of the soldiers shone with brilliance. It is not known which squad first followed the loudspeaker and sang "There are many heroes on the Dadu River..." Immediately afterwards, dozens of strong voices issued "Hey cough yo...", and the soldiers' heroic singing spread across the water. After more than a thousand soldiers worked selflessly for two days and nights, more than three million two hundred thousand jin of grain were all rescued from the flood.

    水中救粮
    新华社记者　胡承清
      8月5日早晨两点多钟，漕河水势猛涨，河北军区某训练团收到了徐水县漕河车站附近粮食仓库三百多万斤粮食急需抢救的紧急通知。团长张晋立刻命令三连和十三连的全体官兵以最快的速度出发抢救，他亲自到现场指挥。
    两个连的战士从睡眠中惊醒，立即集合起来，向目的地急行军前进。雨不停地下着，在三十华里泥泞的路上，接二连三地有人在黑暗中摔倒又爬起来。战士们脚陷在泥里，索兴抛去鞋子。铁道旁尖峭的石子扎进战士们的脚心，有的被扎出了血。然而始终没有一个掉队。
    来到了漕河车站，东方泛出朦胧的曙光。一片黄浊的水淹没了庄稼，水面上稀稀落落地露出几束高粮穗子。二十多个高大的粮垛泡在两尺多深的泥水中，粮库的围墙早已被水冲走。战士们的心都紧缩起来，一刻也不能等待，一定要把粮食一粒不剩的抢救出来。
    紧张的战斗开始了，重重的困难需要克服。粮食如何才能通过一人多深的水面呢？不论是木排还是捆了木条的簸箩，装上粮食仍然要下沉。最后决定架便桥，首先把堆在铁道旁的枕木捆成长方形的桥墩，可是水的浮力太大，桥墩不能下沉。于是战士们爬上木墩向下压，有的双手紧扣住边缘用力向下按，再架上粗长的电线木杆。木料不断从岸上运到水面。水上运木料是个艰巨的劳动：有的把几根木头绑在一起，用手向前推，然后自己又向前游；有的一手划水，一手推运木料，划累了，就伏在木料上休息一下；有时木料忽然翻了个身，人被压到水底，不一会，顽强的脑袋又从水底冒了出来，继续向前推进。十三连一排的贾景才因为身体弱，领导上不叫下水，但是他坚决要求参加在水上运送木料。他说：“哪怕一次只运一块都是好的。眼看着老百姓辛辛苦苦地种出来的粮食要被洪水吞去，自己还能安心干轻便的活吗？不管怎样，抢粮要紧。”就这样，他和同志们一起在水里坚持了八小时。
    谁也没注意的事情发生了：枕木原来都新涂上一层乌黑的沥青，沾染在人们的脸上和身上，像灼伤似的发烫。雨不知在什么时候已经停止，太阳晒在红肿的皮肤上，火辣辣地痛。但谁也不愿在这个时刻下去。
    下午四点多钟，两座桥先后架好。受伤的战士们被动员回去了，新的连队不断地调来抢救粮食。一个个粮垛之间很快地填上了桌椅门板，战士们像猛虎似地爬上高高的粮垛。立刻，铲粮、装包、搬运、缝包、叠包，每一个环节都有组织地活动起来了。二连才调来的战士绝大部分是离开学校不久的小伙子，没有经历过这样的锻炼，但是，谁也不愿在抢救国家宝贵财产的神圣任务中落在后面。身强力壮的一次背上两袋；只能背一袋的，带着小跑步，尽量争取缩短运送的时间。就这样，人们川流不息地把一袋袋粮食从桥西送到桥东路轨上。
    粮垛渐渐地缩小了，战士们身上的伤痕渐渐增多了，有的肩头红肿，有的腰酸得直不起来，有的头晕脑胀，有的手脚被擦破。可是，没有人愿意到休息棚中去休息。二连七班的班长张领镇是今年刚参军的新战士，因劳累过度两次昏迷，醒来后他仍然不顾卫生员的劝阻又冲上去搬运。
    工地上扩音器里响起了“强渡大渡河”的雄壮歌声，战士们疲劳的脸上发出了光辉。不知是哪一班首先跟着扩音器唱起“大渡河上英雄多……”紧接着，几十个人粗壮的嗓子发出“嗳咳哟……”，水面上传开了战士们豪迈的歌声。经过千余个战士两昼夜的忘我劳动，三百二十多万斤粮食从洪水中全部被抢救出来。
