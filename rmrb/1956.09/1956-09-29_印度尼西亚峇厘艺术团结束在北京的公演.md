Xinhua News Agency, September 28th – The Indonesian Bali Art Friendship Delegation has concluded its public performances in Beijing today. Over the past ten days, the Balinese dancers have performed six shows for the literary and art circles and people from all walks of life in Beijing, with a total audience of over 9,300 people.

The dancers' performances have been a great success. Within two days of the performance advertisements being published, all tickets were sold out. The responsible units were overwhelmed with phone calls requesting tickets.

Vice Minister of Culture Zheng Zhenduo and many Chinese dancers successively published articles in the People's Daily, Guangming Daily, Workers' Daily, China Youth Daily, and Beijing Daily, commenting on and introducing Balinese dance. Many newspapers also published photos and sketches of wonderful scenes from Balinese dances. In one of his articles, Zheng Zhenduo referred to Bali as a nurturing and breeding ground for art. An article titled "Celestial Music and Wonderful Dance" written by dancer Ye Ning and published in the People's Daily stated, "Many outstanding actors and musicians in the Bali Art Troupe are amateur artists, which cannot but make us feel even more amazed, illustrating that the Balinese people possess a high level of artistry." Dancer Jia Zuoguang wrote in his article, "I sincerely love the artistic pearl on the island of Bali, and I love even more the working people who live on the free and peaceful land and cultivate thousands of artistic pearls."

Many Chinese dancers have been learning the "Demang Miring" dance from the Balinese dancers these days, and the Balinese dancers have been learning the Chinese Lotus Dance. The Balinese dancers will travel to various places to perform after the National Day of the People's Republic of China.

    印度尼西亚峇厘艺术团结束在北京的公演
    新华社28日讯　印度尼西亚峇厘艺术友好访问团在北京的公演到今天已经结束。十天以来，峇厘舞蹈家们为北京文艺界和各界人民群众演出了六场，观众有九千三百多人。
    舞蹈家们的演出获得很大成功。在公演广告登出以后的两天内，戏票就全部卖光。要求购票的电话使主管单位应接不暇。
    文化部副部长郑振铎和许多中国舞蹈家在人民日报、光明日报、工人日报、中国青年报、北京日报上陆续发表评论和介绍峇厘舞蹈的文章，许多报刊还刊载了峇厘舞蹈精采场面的照片和速写画。郑振铎在他的一篇文章中，把峇厘岛称作一个艺术的涵养地、孕育地。人民日报刊载的舞蹈家叶宁写的题为“仙乐妙舞”的文章写道：“峇厘艺术团的许多优秀演员和乐师，都是业余的艺术家，这不能不使我们感到更加惊异，这说明峇厘人民是具有高度艺术的水平的”。舞蹈家贾作光在他的文章中写道：“我由衷地热爱峇厘岛上的艺术明珠，我更热爱生活在爱好自由的和平土地上，培养着千万颗艺术明珠的劳动人民。”
    许多中国舞蹈家这几天向峇厘舞蹈家学习了“德芒米林”舞，峇厘舞蹈家们学习了中国的荷花舞。峇厘舞蹈家将在中华人民共和国国庆节后，到各地演出。
