Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, September 2nd. According to a report by the German News Agency: Government officials of the German Democratic Republic issued a statement criticizing the West German Foreign Minister's radio address in Munich on August 29th, in which he suggested that Western countries hold an international conference to discuss the German question.

The GDR government officials pointed out in the statement: This suggestion by the West German Foreign Minister once again proves that the leading politicians of West Germany are attempting to seize the right to decide the national question of Germany from the hands of the German people. These politicians have realized that the German people will never agree to expand the militarist rule of West Germany to the whole of Germany.

The government officials said that, just like the Egyptian people, the vast majority of the German people oppose foreign interference in their internal affairs. The German people believe that the two Germanys can peacefully reach an agreement on matters of German internal affairs.

    民主德国反对让外国干涉德国事务
    斥责西德要求西方国家开会讨论德国问题
    新华社柏林2日电　据德意志通讯社报道：德意志民主共和国政府人士发表谈话，斥责西德外交部长8月29日在慕尼黑发表广播演说的时候建议由西方国家举行一个国际会议来讨论德国问题。
    民主德国政府人士在谈话中指出：西德外交部长的这一建议再一次证明，西德的首要政客们企图把决定德国民族问题的权利从德国人民的手里夺走。这些政客已经认识到，德国人民永远不会赞成把西德的军国主义统治扩大到全德国。
    政府人士说，正像埃及人民一样，绝大多数德国人民反对外国干涉他们的国内事务。德国人民认为，两个德国能够就德国的国内事务问题和平地达成协议。
