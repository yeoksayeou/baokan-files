    Shizhong County Farm Arranges Planting Time According to Crop Growth Laws, Changing Two Crops a Year to Three Crops and Four Harvests

    (Our dispatch) The Shizhong County Farm in Yunnan Province has adopted intercropping and mixed cropping methods to change two crops a year to three crops and four harvests, which can obtain a large increase in production. The farm has 8.45 mu of dry land with yellow sandy soil. In the past, only one season of soybeans and one season of wheat were planted each year, and the yield per unit area was very low, while the land's fallow time was more than three months. This year, they changed to three crops and four harvests. Wheat yielded an average of 400 jin per mu; corn and soybeans were intercropped and grew very well. It is estimated that corn can yield 700 jin per mu, and soybeans can yield 150 jin per mu; there is also a season of potatoes, planned to yield 1,000 jin per mu (equivalent to 250 jin of staple food). The yield per unit area of the four crops reaches 1,500 jin, which can increase production by about three times. They analyzed the growth laws and seasonal changes of these four crops and made precise arrangements for planting time. They also used the method of continuously increasing fertilizer application to compensate for the large consumption of land fertility.

    石屏县农场根据作物生长规律安排栽种时间
    把一年两熟地改为三熟四收
    本报讯　云南省石屏县农场采用间种套种办法，改一年两熟为三熟四收，可以获得大量增产。该农场有8.45亩黄沙土壤的旱地，过去每年只种一季黄豆，一季小麦，单位面积产量很低，而土地的休闲时间却达三个月以上。今年他们改为三熟四收，小麦每亩平均收了四百斤；玉米与黄豆间作，生长得也很好，预计玉米每亩可收七百斤，黄豆可收一百五十斤；还有一季马铃薯，计划每亩收一千斤（折合主粮二百五十斤），四种作物的单位面积产量达一千五百斤，可增产三倍左右。他们分析了这四种作物的生长规律和节令变化，把栽种时间作了精密的安排。还用不断增施肥料的办法，以弥补大量消耗的地力。
