This newspaper reports: Yunnan Simao County Lushan Township Gaofeng Cooperative neglected leadership of members' family sideline production, leading to a tendency for members to go up the mountains to open up land. Some members of the Gaofeng Cooperative opened up many barren lands, some near the village and some seven or eight li away from their homes. Because the members had no pocket money, and the cooperative cadres did not see the members' need to develop family sideline production, the Party branch only entrusted the task of developing family sideline production to the women's organization, but the women's organization did not take it seriously. Some members then automatically went up the mountains to open up wasteland. In order to quickly correct this tendency, the Gaofeng Cooperative Party branch studied the current situation of neglecting family sideline production and actively took the lead in developing family sideline production work.

    不能忽视家庭副业
    本报讯　云南思茅县芦山乡高峰社忽视领导社员家庭副业生产，发生社员上山开地的偏向。高峰社的部分社员，有的在寨子附近，有的到离家七、八里路的山上开了许多荒地。因为社员手里没有零用钱，社干看不到社员有发展家庭副业生产的要求，党支部只是把发展家庭副业生产的任务委托给妇女组织去管，而妇女组织又没认真的去管。部分社员就自动的上山去开荒了。高峰社党支部为了迅速纠正这种偏向，对目前忽视家庭副业生产的情况作了研究，积极把发展家庭副业生产的工作领导起来。
