Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, September 6th. According to a report in the "Indian Express" on September 5th, the Soviet Union has expressed its willingness to help India build a factory to manufacture coal mining machinery and equipment. It is expected that a group of Soviet experts will soon come here to study ways to establish this factory. A group of Soviet experts are already in India helping the government build a heavy machinery manufacturing plant.

The Indian government plans to increase India's coal production from 38 million tons to 60 million tons during the Second Five-Year Plan. It is estimated that machinery worth 300 million rupees must be imported to complete this production increase plan.

The possibility of importing coal mining equipment from abroad is currently being studied. India recently purchased twenty-five drilling rigs from the Soviet Union. The government hopes to purchase forty more.

The Indian government has established a powerful Coal Industry Committee, chaired by the Minister of Production, K.C. Reddy. This committee will conduct investigations and research to formulate plans for the development, utilization, and preservation of India's coal resources.

    苏联帮助印度建设采煤机器设备制造厂
    新华社新德里6日电　据“印度快报”9月5日报道，苏联已经表示愿意帮助印度建造一个制造采煤的机器设备的工厂。预料一批苏联专家不久将到这里来研究建立这个工厂的办法。目前已经有一批苏联专家在印度帮助政府兴建一个重型机器制造厂。
    印度政府计划要在第二个五年计划期间把印度的煤产量从三千八百万吨增加到六千万吨。估计必须输入价值三亿卢比的机器来完成这个增产计划。
    目前正在研究从国外输入采煤设备的可能性。印度最近向苏联购买了二十五架钻探机。政府希望再购买四十架。
    印度政府已经成立了一个权力很大的煤业委员会，由生产部长基·钱·雷迪任主席。这个委员会将进行调查和研究工作，以便制定印度煤矿资源的发展、利用和保存的计划。
