　　Seaside Poems
　　Zāng Kèjiā
　　On the navy's morning parade ground, the marching steps shake the earth; in the evening, light and agile figures playing ball flash in the green shade; lamplight shines through the glass windows, and under the lamplight comes the sound of loud reading.

　　Son and the Sea
　　During the slack season, he hurried to see his son; his son is a navy soldier, and when he has nothing to do he walks on the beach morning and night, alone facing the sea. After he returns home, he often dreams at night: emerald green waves galloping like wild horses, black ribbons flying in the sea breeze. [Note] [Note] The navy cap has a pair of black ribbons.

　　A Glimpse
　　The sea is blue, the sky is blue, a stretch of blue indistinguishable from the edge, it forms a backdrop for a Young Pioneer, her red scarf is redder than a rainbow!

　　She and Him
　　Her father sailed out to sea in a fishing boat, leaving her alone to guard the house, under the arbor, holding a literacy textbook, I know her heart is not on the book. A young fisherman is drying nets on the beach, walking back and forth, he can't pull the fishnet straight, two pairs of eyes meet and shine, I know his heart is not on the fishnet.

　　Inducement
　　Waking up from a nap, the tide and the cheers of the surfers poured into the window together. What an enticing sound, it's more powerful than a rope!

　　Undress
　　Taken off, taken off, taken off the burdens on the body and in the heart. Oh sea – green world, one light body after another throws itself into your undulating embrace.

　　Zhànshān
　　Zhànshān, green trees pave the avenue with coolness, distant mountains and near mountains are like never-ending clouds, the sea embraces you with its arms, Zhànshān, you are the green sideburns of the famous scenic spot Qingdao. Before liberation, this place was a restricted area, and the beautiful scenery was stained with the filth of "officials and dignitaries". Today, workers, writers, cadres… are walking on the tree-lined roads, thousands of miles away, they have become the figures in the painting of Qingdao in summer.

　　Return
　　After a sea bath, the hot sand burns the feet, walking home light and comfortable, a straw hat shields the sun in the sky, a shadow sways on the ground.

　　"Goodbye, Sea"
　　Early in the morning, I said goodbye to the sea, the sea hadn't woken up in the fog, stepping on the sand that rustled, "Goodbye, Sea," I turned back and gave the sea a fond look.

    海滨杂诗
  　臧克家
      海军早晨的操场上，练操的步伐把大地震动；傍晚，绿树荫里闪动着赛球的轻捷身影；玻璃窗里透出灯光，灯光下传出琅琅的读书声。
    儿子和大海农闲时节他赶来看儿子，儿子是海军战士，没事早晚散步到沙滩，独个儿对着大海。等他回到家里以后，夜里常常作梦：碧绿的波涛像野马奔腾，黑色的飘带飘着海风。〔注〕〔注〕海军制帽有一双黑色飘带。
      一瞥海水蓝，天色蓝，一片蓝色分不开边，它作了一个少先队员的背景，她的红领巾红得比虹还鲜艳！
      她和他爸爸驾起渔船出海去了，留下她一个把家门守望，凉棚下，手拿一本识字课本，我知道她的心并不在书上。一个年青的渔人在沙滩上晒网，来来回回鱼网总拉不平，两双眼睛一碰就发光，我知道他的心并不在鱼网上。
      引诱午睡醒来，海潮和弄潮人的欢呼一齐涌进了窗子。多诱人的声音呵，它比绳子更有力！
      脱下了脱下了，脱下了身上和心上的负载。大海呵——绿色的世界，一个个轻快的身子投向你起伏的胸怀。
      湛山湛山，绿树给大道铺上凉荫，远山近山像永不消散的云，大海用双臂环抱着你，湛山，你是胜地青岛的青鬓。解放以前这里是禁区，大好山水沾染了“达官贵人”的污尘，今天，林荫道上走着工人、作家、干部……，千里万里，他们作了夏天青岛的画中人。
      海水浴罢热沙子烫得脚发痒，一身轻便走在归途上，一顶草帽遮住天上的太阳，一个影子在地上晃。
    “再见，大海”一早我向大海辞行，大海在雾罩里还没有醒，踏着沙沙作响的沙滩，“再见，大海”，我回头向大海投一个青眼。
