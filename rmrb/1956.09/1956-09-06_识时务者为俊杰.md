    A Wise Man Knows Better Than To Fight Against The Times
    Following the London conference, Britain has employed all kinds of threats and intimidation to make Egypt accept Dulles' "international control" plan. It continues to increase its troops in the Mediterranean and allows France to use the Cyprus base. These actions have aggravated the tension in the Mediterranean and endangered world peace.
    The Dulles plan proposed by the United States, Britain, and France, no matter how cleverly worded, is essentially an infringement on Egypt's sovereignty, which Egypt cannot accept. In this case, does Britain really dare to launch a war against Egypt? France is already deeply mired in the Algerian war and cannot take care of itself, so it will not be of much help to Britain. Although the United States supported Britain at the London conference, it had ulterior motives and would not send troops to help. Therefore, if Britain insists on armed intervention, it will inevitably have to bear it independently. However, Britain has just cut a small portion of its military spending in order to overcome the country's financial crisis, and now it is going to wage a major war, which is tantamount to seeking its own demise.
    The die-hards in Britain are currently instigating non-Egyptian technical personnel of the former Suez Canal Company to resign, paralyzing canal navigation, and creating an excuse to send British troops back there. But everyone knows that if canal navigation really stops, Egypt is not responsible in any way, and the "legitimacy" of British troops returning to the Suez Canal area cannot be established, which in the end is just a waste of effort.
    What the British government should pay more attention to is that Egypt is not alone in this struggle to defend its sovereignty. A communiqué issued by the Political Committee of the Arab League on August 13 stated, "An infringement on the sovereignty of any Arab country is an infringement on the sovereignty of all Arab countries." This clearly shows the unity of the Arab countries. The Bandung Conference has formed an unbreakable front of anti-colonial forces in Asia and Africa. Therefore, all Asian and African countries fully support Egypt and condemn the West's threat of force. The countries that have expressed support for Egypt's just actions have a total population of 1.5 billion, accounting for three-fifths of the world's population. There is no more authoritative and persuasive figure than this. This shows why the Suez Canal issue can only be resolved peacefully, and any attempt to impose one's will on Egypt is doomed to failure.
    In fact, the outcome of the London conference, in particular, provided Britain with the best opportunity to back down. Because the verbatim record of the conference proceedings will be sent to the Egyptian government, this gives Britain a face-saving way to step down, while at the same time being able to continue negotiations to obtain the guarantee of freedom of navigation on the Suez Canal that Britain is most concerned about. Now world public opinion, including public opinion in Britain, with the exception of a small group representing the interests of colonialist die-hards and monopoly capital, can be said to be basically unanimous in advocating a peaceful solution. As long as Britain abandons its intention of armed intervention, France will surely follow suit; and the United States' trick of instigating Britain to pull chestnuts out of the fire will be completely bankrupt. Therefore, if Britain no longer stubbornly insists on its own way, this storm can be calmed down immediately. A wise man knows better than to fight against the times; this old saying can be provided to Britain for reference.

    识时务者为俊杰
    伦敦会议结束后，英国采用了一切威胁和恫吓手段，想使埃及接受杜勒斯的“国际管制”计划。它继续增兵地中海，并准许法国使用塞浦路斯基地。这些行动加剧了地中海紧张局势，危害世界和平。
    美、英、法提出的杜勒斯计划，不论在措词上如何巧妙，实质上是侵犯埃及主权的，埃及不可能接受。在这种情况下，英国真正敢对埃及发动战争吗？法国已经深陷在阿尔及利亚战争的泥潭中，自顾不暇，对英国不会有多大帮助。美国在伦敦会议中，虽然支持英国，但它别有用心，也不会出兵相助。因此，英国如果硬要进行武装干涉，势必由自己独立承当。但是，英国刚刚为了渡过国家的财政危机，紧缩了一小部分军事开支，现在又要大兴干戈，这岂不是自寻绝路？
    英国的死硬派，目前正在唆使前苏彝士运河公司的非埃及籍技术人员离职，使运河航行瘫痪，为重新把英军送到那儿去制造借口。但是谁都知道，如果运河航行真正停止了，埃及是不负任何责任的，英国军队回到苏彝士运河区的“合法性”也就不能成立，到头来只不过是白费心血罢了。
    更值得英国政府注意的是：埃及在这次保卫主权的斗争中，并不是孤独的。阿拉伯联盟政治委员会8月13日发表的一项公报中申明，“侵犯任何一个阿拉伯国家的主权，就是侵犯所有阿拉伯国家的主权。”这明确地表示了阿拉伯国家的团结一致。万隆会议把亚非两洲反殖民主义的力量，结成了一条牢不可破的阵线。因此，所有的亚非国家完全支持埃及，谴责西方的武力威胁。对埃及的正义行动表示支持的国家，人口总数共达十五亿，占全世界人口的五分之三，没有比这个更有权威，更具有说服力的数字了。这说明了为什么苏彝士运河问题，只有用和平方式才能获得解决，而任何把别人的意志强加在埃及身上的企图，都是注定要失败的。
    其实，伦敦会议的结局，特别对英国提供了借此收篷的最好的机会。因为这个会议进程的逐字记录要送交埃及政府，这就给英国可以很漂亮地下台的面子，同时又能够继续谈判，使英国获得她所最关心的苏彝士运河上航行自由的保证。现在全世界的舆论，包括英国国内的舆论在内，除了一小撮代表殖民主义者死硬派和垄断资本的利益者外，可以说基本上是一致主张和平解决的。只要英国放弃武力干涉的意图，法国一定会追随于后；而美国唆使英国、火中取栗的诡计，也就完全破产了。所以如果英国不再妄自尊大地坚持下去，这场风波是可以立即平静的。识时务者为俊杰，这句老话可以提供给英国作参考。
