Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, September 7th - In the areas of Heilongjiang Province that suffered from flooding, agricultural production cooperatives are universally carrying out production and self-help activities.

Of the 700,000 hectares of farmland in the province affected by waterlogging, 400,000 hectares can achieve varying degrees of harvest after agricultural production cooperatives in various places have dug ditches for drainage, supported seedlings, and washed seedlings. Now, the members are strengthening field management to promote early maturity and high yield of the crops that can be harvested.

While rescuing farmland, the disaster-stricken agricultural cooperatives have also universally formulated sideline production plans and carried out sideline production activities. Some agricultural cooperatives have put forward slogans such as "What is lost in the water is found in the water," "What is lost in the water is found in the land, and in the mountains," and "Land production is reduced, but members' income is not reduced," and have organized a variety of sideline production activities. Xiqin Township in Shuangcheng County, where about half of the cultivated land has suffered from waterlogging, has already found more than 20 ways to engage in sideline production. In the disaster areas of Zhaodong, Hulan and other counties near the Songhua River, agricultural cooperatives have organized fishing teams. The seven disaster-stricken agricultural cooperatives in Zhaodong County caught more than 10,000 jin of fish in five days, with an income of more than 1,200 yuan. Hulan County organized a 2,500-person fishing team, which can catch 50,000 to 60,000 jin of fish every day. The Heilongjiang Provincial Food Company has also set up fresh fish purchasing stations in the disaster-stricken areas along the river, so that the fish caught by the disaster victims can be sold in a timely manner.

Many places have also organized the masses to collect sheep grass and firewood, and housewives have also started weaving and other household sideline production. Yilan, Boli, Tangyuan and other counties near the mountainous areas have organized more than 10,000 people to go to the mountains to collect medicinal materials.

    水里丢，水里找，地里找，山上找，减产不减收！
    黑龙江灾区农业社生产自救
    新华社哈尔滨7日电　黑龙江省遭受水灾的地区，普遍以农业生产合作社为单位开展生产自救活动。
    全省受水涝的七十万公顷农田，经过各地农业生产合作社的挖沟排水，扶苗洗苗后，有四十万公顷能得到不同程度的收成。现在社员正在加强田间管理，促使能够收成的庄稼早熟多产。
    在抢救农田的同时，受灾的各农业社还普遍制定了副业生产计划，开展了副业生产活动。有些农业社提出了“水里丢，水里找”、“水里丢，地里找，山上找”、“地减产，社员不减收入”等口号，组织了多种多样副业生产。大约有半数耕地遭受内涝的双城县希勤乡，已经找出了二十多种副业生产门路。靠近松花江的肇东、呼兰等县灾区，各农业社都组织了打鱼队。肇东县受灾的七个农业社五天内就捕了一万多斤鱼，收入一千二百余元。呼兰县组织二千五百人的打鱼队伍，每天都可以捕获五万到六万斤鱼。黑龙江省食品公司还特别在沿江受灾区设立了鲜鱼收购站，使灾民捕的鱼及时卖出去。
    许多地方还组织群众打羊草打柴草，家庭妇女也开始了编织等家庭副业生产。靠近山区的依兰、勃利、汤原等县已组织了一万多人上山采摘药材。
