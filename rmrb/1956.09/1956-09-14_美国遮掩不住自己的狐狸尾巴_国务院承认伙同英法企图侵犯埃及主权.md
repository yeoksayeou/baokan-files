Xinhua News Agency, September 13th: Washington - After Britain and France announced plans to establish a Suez Canal "Users' Association" in order to seize control of the canal from Egypt, the U.S. government, while announcing its agreement to participate in this "association," has tried its best to conceal its true intentions and avoid further expressing a clear attitude.

State Department spokesman White issued a one-sentence statement at a press conference on the 12th, saying, "The United States has agreed to participate in this plan." Prior to this, U.S. officials had remained silent for several hours on the section of the announcement made first by London and Paris that the U.S. had already agreed to participate in the British and French plans. Subsequently, White held a press conference and mysteriously refused to confirm or "dispute" Eden's announcement. However, only a few minutes after the first press conference ended, White summoned the reporters again and gave them the formal one-sentence statement above. At the same time, White refused to explain any other reactions from the United States, nor would he elaborate on any details of the U.S.'s understanding of the proposal.

Several hours later, White held his third press conference of the day and issued a second statement saying: "If Britain, either alone or in conjunction with other countries, proposes the organization of a users' association by the eighteen countries that put forward the London Conference proposals, or by some of those countries willing to do so, and perhaps by other countries as well, the United States will participate in such a users' association. We believe that the users' association will exercise the rights belonging to the users under the 1888 Convention and will seek cooperation with Egypt to achieve the results guaranteed by that convention."

The Associated Press quoted U.S. officials as saying that the U.S. position is that if the plan is endorsed by a sufficient number of the eighteen countries that proposed the previous international control plan for the Suez Canal, the organization will be established. If the plan does not receive the endorsement of a sufficient number of countries, it will not be implemented.

Simultaneous with the U.S. government's adoption of this secretive attitude, Reuters and Associated Press both reported that the idea of establishing a Canal "Users' Association" was initially proposed by U.S. Secretary of State Dulles.

### 美国遮掩不住自己的狐狸尾巴  国务院承认伙同英法企图侵犯埃及主权

    美国遮掩不住自己的狐狸尾巴
    国务院承认伙同英法企图侵犯埃及主权
    据新华社13日讯　华盛顿消息：在英国和法国宣布计划成立苏彝士运河“使用者协会”以便从埃及手里夺取对运河的控制权以后，美国官方一方面宣布同意参加这个“协会”，一方面又竭力遮掩，避免进一步表示明确的态度。
    国务院发言人怀特12日在记者招待会上发表了一个只有一句话的声明说，“美国已经同意参加这个计划”。在这以前，美国官方曾经对首先由伦敦和巴黎宣布的美国已经同意参加英、法计划一节保持了好几个小时的沉默。随后，怀特就举行了一次记者招待会，并且神秘地拒绝对艾登的宣布加以证实或“进行争论”。但是在第一次记者招待会结束以后只有几分钟，怀特又召集了记者，交给他们上面的那个只有一句话的正式声明。同时怀特拒绝说明美国的任何其他反应，也不肯说明美国对这项建议的了解的任何详情。
    在几小时以后，怀特又举行了一天中的第三次记者招待会，发表了第二个声明说：“如果英国单独地或者和其他国家联合起来建议由提出伦敦会议建议的十八个国家组织、或者由其中某些愿意这样做的国家、以及也许还有其他国家组织使用者联合会的话，美国将参加这样的使用者联合会。我们认为，使用者联合会将代表使用者行使根据1888年公约规定属于它们的权利，并且寻求和埃及进行将达到预定这个公约所保证的结果的合作。”
    合众社引美国官员的话说，美国的立场是：如果这个计划在提出前一个国际管制苏彝士运河方案的十八个国家当中得到足够国家的赞同，这个机构将建立起来。如果这个计划得不到足够数量的国家的赞同，就不能加以实施。
    和美国官方采取这种遮遮掩掩的态度同时，路透社和美联社都传出消息说，关于成立运河“使用国协会”的想法最初正是由美国国务卿杜勒斯提出的。
