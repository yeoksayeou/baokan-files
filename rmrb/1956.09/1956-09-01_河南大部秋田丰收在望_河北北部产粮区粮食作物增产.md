Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 31st -- This year, autumn crops in Henan Province suffered continuous disasters, but after strenuous efforts to salvage them, most areas of the province are still expected to achieve a good harvest.

Now, early autumn crops such as sorghum, corn, early rice, and millet have been largely harvested. In the counties south of the Huai River in the Xinyang Special Zone, the majority of early rice will increase production by 20% compared to last year's bumper harvest. In counties like Yanling in the Xuchang Special Zone, sorghum yields have increased by 30 jin per mu, and millet yields have increased by 50 jin per mu. Other areas have also achieved increased production.

Late autumn crops in hilly, mountainous, and sandy loam plains are also expected to be bountiful. Crops such as soybeans and peanuts are also growing better than in previous years. In another half-month, the late autumn crops will also begin to be harvested.

Farmland expected to achieve good harvests accounts for approximately 70% of the province's autumn-sown area. The remaining 30% of areas, due to uncontrollable typhoons, rainstorms, and waterlogging, will experience severe production reductions.

Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 31st -- The major autumn crops in the three grain-producing special zones of Tangshan, Zhangjiakou, and Chengde in northern Hebei Province have yielded a bumper harvest. Currently, the early-maturing broomcorn millet and sorghum are already being harvested, and other crops will follow suit.

According to estimates from the agricultural departments of these three special zones, all crops have increased production compared to last year. In the Tangshan Special Zone, the average yield of over 10 million mu of grain crops is 345 jin per mu, an increase of approximately 16% compared to last year, exceeding this year's planned output by 10%. The total output reached over 3.2 billion jin, more than 500 million jin more than last year. In the Chengde Special Zone, the average yield of grain crops per mu increased by 12% compared to last year. In the five counties of Kangbao, Shangdu, Guyuan, Zhangbei, and Shangyi on the Bashang area of the Zhangjiakou Special Zone, the nearly 4 million mu of naked oats generally increased production by about 20% per mu compared to last year. Although crops in some counties of this special zone suffered from varying degrees of natural disasters, the total grain output still exceeded that of last year.

    河南大部秋田丰收在望
    河北北部产粮区粮食作物增产
    据新华社郑州31日电　今年河南省的秋季作物连续受灾，但在极力抢救之后，省内大部地区的作物仍将获得丰收。
    现在，高粱、玉米、早稻、谷子等早秋作物已大部收获完毕。信阳专区淮河南岸各县的早稻，大部分都将在去年丰收的基础上增产二成。许昌专区的鄢陵等县每亩高粱增产三十斤，每亩谷子增产五十斤。其他地区也都获得了增产。
    山岗、丘陵和沙壤平原区的晚秋作物也已丰收在望。大豆、花生等作物也都长的比往年好，再过半个月，晚秋作物也将开始收割了。
    全省能够获得丰收的农田约占全省秋播面积的70％左右。其余有30％左右的地区由于遭受了人力不能抗拒的台风、暴雨、内涝等灾害，将要严重减产。
    据新华社保定31日电　河北省北部产粮区唐山、张家口、承德三个专区的大秋作物丰收。目前，对早熟的黍稷、高粱已经开镰收割，其它作物也将陆续登场。
    根据这三个专区农业部门的估计，各种作物都比去年增产。唐山专区的一千多万亩粮食作物，平均每亩产三百四十五斤，约比去年增加16％，超过今年计划产量10％；总产量达到三十二亿多斤，比去年多五亿多斤。承德专区粮食作物每亩平均产量比去年提高12％。张家口专区坝上的康保、商都、沽源、张北、尚义五县，近四百万亩莜麦一般每亩比去年增产20％左右。这个专区虽然有一部分县的庄稼遭受了不同程度的自然灾害，但是粮食总产量仍超过去年。
