Xinhua News Agency, Karamay, 30th -- Xinhua reporters Yi Xiao and Han Wenhuei report: The Karamay exploration area is conducting intense preparations to protect against the cold for winter drilling operations.

As early as the beginning of June, the exploration area established a winter protection committee. Recently, an insulation workshop was also established. Of the 77 boilers needed here this winter, the Dushanzi Mining Bureau has already transferred 22, and the other 55 are being manufactured in the Northeast and elsewhere. Relevant units have also ordered 16,000 tons of coal for boilers from Hostologay; and ordered a large number of felt boots, cotton gloves, and leather overcoats from Urumqi, Yili, and other places. They have also ordered tens of thousands of tons of firewood, horse manure, sawdust, wheat bran, and reeds from the People's Liberation Army troops and production units stationed there, in preparation for keeping the drilling rigs warm in winter.

In order to ensure the normal supply of water for engineering and domestic use in winter, relevant units, in addition to stepping up the construction of water pipelines and striving to complete them before freezing, are also preparing insulation equipment for water transport vehicles. The newly established insulation workshop in the exploration area will also establish a steam vehicle team. When water pipes and oil nozzles freeze, this team will go to thaw and insulate them with steam. This mobile anti-freeze team will have eight steam vehicles, two of which are already available, and the other six are being manufactured at the Dushanzi Mining Bureau's General Machinery Repair Factory.

In Karamay, after summer comes winter. Currently, there are only two months left before the freezing period. The winter here is very cold, with an average temperature always around minus 30 degrees Celsius. Therefore, all cold protection measures must be prepared in advance.

However, according to the person in charge of the Karamay exploration area, the major difficulty currently existing in the cold protection preparation work is the lack of transportation capacity. Although many anti-freeze materials such as coal and steam pipelines have been purchased, they cannot be transported to the exploration area in time due to the lack of vehicles. In particular, the construction progress of the main highways from Karamay to Dushanzi and Hostologay is slow. Vehicles are severely damaged when driving on the uneven dirt roads, which further exacerbates this difficulty. Secondly, according to the contract, 20 of the boilers ordered in the Northeast should have been delivered in August, but it is said that the materials only began to be processed in August, so the delivery time will inevitably be delayed. In addition, the journey is long, and by the time they are transported to Xinjiang, it will be too late. In addition, the timber needed for the winter has not yet been secured.

Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 30th -- The 632 Geological Team of the Northwest Geological Bureau has prepared leather overcoats, gloves, hats, felt boots, etc. for the geological drilling personnel working in the Qaidam Basin this winter. Some of these supplies have already been transported into the basin. More than 30 sets of stoves for heating have also been made, and with those prepared last year, it can be ensured that each drilling site is equipped with three stoves, and the staff dormitories are also equipped with stoves. More than 1,400 tons of fuel coal for production and living use have also been prepared at the same time. They also made cold protection covers for cars with sheepskin and canvas.

More than 10,000 sets of cotton clothes ordered by the Qinghai Province trade department from other provinces have also been transported to the Wuwei Station on the Lanxin Railway, ready to be transported to the basin. Recently, more than five tons of various bottled wines were also transported into the basin from Xining.

Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 30th -- The wellbores of a pair of new inclined shafts are already excavated at the Yuka Coal Mine in the Qaidam Basin. Workers are both tunneling the roadways in the underground mining area and constructing winch rooms, boiler rooms, and staff residences on the ground. It is expected that this pair of inclined shafts will be completed and put into production by the end of this year. At that time, the petroleum exploration teams and other geological teams working in the Qaidam Basin will be able to obtain enough coal from the Yuka Coal Mine.

Since large-scale exploration and development work began in the Qaidam Basin, the amount of coal used has increased year by year. Originally, the coal needed in the basin was supplied from Hami, Xinjiang, more than 600 kilometers away, which is far from meeting the current needs. Therefore, the Qinghai Provincial Department of Industry decided to invest in the construction of the local state-owned Yuka Coal Mine, and began construction of this pair of inclined shafts in October last year.

    保证冬季钻探施工能够顺利进行
    克拉玛依积极进行防寒准备
    柴达木盆地为地质工作人员准备好防寒用品、并正在建设新煤井
    新华社克拉玛依30日电　新华社记者伊晓、韩文慧报道：克拉玛依探区正在紧张进行冬季钻探施工的御寒准备工作。
    早在6月初，探区就成立了冬防委员会。最近又建立了保温车间。今年冬天这里需要的七十七部锅炉，独山子矿务局已经调给了二十二部，另外五十五部正在东北等地制造。有关单位还在霍斯托洛盖订购了一万六千吨锅炉用煤；在乌鲁木齐、伊犁等地订购了大批的毡筒靴、棉手套和皮大衣。他们还向人民解放军驻军和生产部队订下了成万吨的烧柴、马粪、锯末、麦糠和芦苇，准备冬天用来为钻机保暖。
    为了保证冬季能正常供应工程用水和生活用水，有关单位除了加紧建设输水管，争取在结冻前完工以外，还在筹措运水车的保暖装备。探区新成立的保温车间，还将建立一支蒸气车队。在水管、油嘴发生冻结情况时，这支队伍就将前往用蒸气化冻保温。这支机动防冻队伍将拥有八部蒸气车，现在已有两部，另六部正在独山子矿务局机械修理总厂制造中。
    在克拉玛依过了夏天就是冬天。目前离结冻期只有两个月的时间。这里冬天很冷，平均气温总在摄氏零下三十度左右。因此一切防寒措施必须预先准备完善。
    但是，据克拉玛依探区负责人告诉记者说：目前御寒准备工作中存在着重大困难是运输力量不足，许多防冻物资如煤炭、蒸气管线等虽然已经购妥，但因为没有车辆不能保证及时运到探区。特别是克拉玛依通往独山子和霍斯托洛盖两地的公路干线修筑进度迟缓，汽车在凹凸不平的便道上行驶，车辆损坏严重，更加大了这一困难。其次，在东北订制的锅炉，按照合同在8月份就要交货二十部，但据说8月份才开始下料，这样交货时间势必推迟，再加上路途遥远，及至运来新疆已经为时过晚。另外，过冬所需木料现在也还没有着落。
    新华社西宁30日电　西北地质局六三二队已经为今年冬季在柴达木盆地工作的地质钻探人员准备好了皮大衣、手套、帽子、毡靴等。这些物资有的已经运进了盆地。三十多套取暖用的火炉也做好了，加上去年置备的，今年可以保证每个钻井工地装上三个火炉，职工宿舍里也装上炉子。供生产和生活用的一千四百多吨燃煤也同时准备好了。他们还用羊皮和帆布给汽车做了防寒罩。
    青海省的贸易部门在外省订购的一万多套棉衣也已经运到兰新铁路上的武威车站，准备运往盆地，最近还从西宁运进盆地各种瓶酒五吨多。
    新华社西安30日电　柴达木盆地鱼卡煤矿正在新建一对斜井的井筒已经开凿完毕，工人们正在一面掘进地下采煤区的巷道，一面建设地面上的绞车房、锅炉房和职工住宅等。预计到今年年底，这对斜井便可以完工投入生产。那时，在柴达木盆地工作的石油勘探队和其他地质队，都可以从鱼卡煤矿得到足够的煤炭。
    柴达木盆地自从进行大规模的勘探和开发工作以来，用煤量逐年增多。原来盆地需用的煤炭，都是由六百多公里以外的新疆哈密等地供应，这种情况已经远远不能适应目前的需要。因此，青海省工业厅便决定投资兴建地方国营鱼卡煤矿，并且在去年10月开始建设这对斜井。
