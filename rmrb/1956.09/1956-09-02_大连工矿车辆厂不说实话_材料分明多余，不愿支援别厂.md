    Dalian Engineering and Mining Vehicle Factory Doesn't Tell the Truth
    Excess Materials Are Obvious, Unwilling to Support Other Factories
    When the state-owned Dalian Engineering and Mining Vehicle Factory requested scrap steel from the First Ministry of Machine Building, it sent official documents and telegrams, truly acting with "burning urgency." They claimed that they would have to stop production due to lack of materials by mid-June. However, after the First Ministry of Machine Building sent people to inspect and verify, they discovered that they had a large amount of scrap steel and scrap pig iron, and there was no urgent need at all. Deputy Section Chief Jin of the factory's supply section revealed their true feelings, which were: "If we don't ask for more materials early, we're afraid we won't be able to get them later."

    Coincidentally, some enterprises in Shenyang needed scrap pig iron but couldn't get it resolved. Based on the Dalian Engineering and Mining Vehicle Factory's scrap pig iron storage situation, the ministry decided to allocate 1,000 tons to Shenyang. However, after this factory signed a contract for 400 tons, when the Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Factory wanted to sign a contract with them for another 200 tons, Section Chief Guo of the supply section was unwilling to give it. He only agreed to allocate inferior scrap pig iron mixed with sand, refusing to give good scrap pig iron, and said that according to their inventory, they only had 400 tons of excess scrap pig iron. The comrades in the ministry recalculated in detail and found that the factory actually had more than 700 tons of excess scrap pig iron, after meeting their needs for the second half of the year and reserving enough for January of next year. There was no problem with allocating another 200 tons.

    The Dalian Engineering and Mining Vehicle Factory's supply section fears having too few materials when requesting them, and fears having too many materials when allocating them, and even resorts to telling lies. Why is this? We hope for an investigation and response.
    First Ministry of Machine Building Supply Bureau, Xia Tiezheng

### 大连工矿车辆厂不说实话  材料分明多余，不愿支援别厂

    大连工矿车辆厂不说实话
    材料分明多余，不愿支援别厂
    国营大连工矿车辆厂在向第一机械工业部要废钢的时候，又是公文，又是电报，真是“急如星火”。他们说，6月中旬就要停工待料。可是，第一机械工业部派人去检查核实以后，发现他们废钢、废生铁很多，根本就不急需。这个厂供应科的金副科长说出了他们的真心话，原来他们认为：“不早要些材料，怕以后会要不到。”
    凑巧，当时沈阳某些企业需用废生铁得不到解决，部里根据大连工矿车辆厂的废生铁贮存情况，决定调拨出一千吨给沈阳。可是，在这个厂签出了四百吨的合同以后，沈阳第一机床厂又要同他们签二百吨的合同时，供应科的郭科长就不愿给了。他只答应拨给带沙的次等废生铁，而不肯给好的废生铁，并且说，据他们清查，就只多出废生铁四百吨。部里的同志重新算了一次细账，实际上这个厂除满足下半年的需要和留出明年一月份的储备以外，还多余废生铁七百多吨，再拨出二百吨是没有问题的。
    大连工矿车辆厂供应科要材料唯恐少，调出材料唯恐多，并且不惜说瞎话，这究竟为什么？希望检查答复一下。
