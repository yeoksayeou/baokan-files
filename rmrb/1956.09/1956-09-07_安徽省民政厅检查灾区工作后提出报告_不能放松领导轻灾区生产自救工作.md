Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, September 6th (Reporter Gong Hao) Reporting: While strengthening leadership in heavily affected disaster areas, lightly affected areas cannot be ignored. This is a problem that must be noted, as proposed by the Anhui Provincial Department of Civil Affairs working group after on-the-ground investigations in disaster areas. This working group recently investigated three agricultural production cooperatives in the Banjiqu District of Woyang County with varying degrees of disaster impact. The results of the investigation show that due to the relaxation of leadership in lightly affected areas, while the disaster situation in the heavily affected Democratic First Cooperative and Democratic Second Cooperative was stable, the disaster situation in the lightly affected Peace First Cooperative actually worsened.

The phenomenon of selling old furniture and old clothes, which was not found in the heavily affected cooperatives, began to appear in the lightly affected Peace First Cooperative.

The Peace First Cooperative actually harvested 110,716 jin of grain in the summer, with an average of only about ten jin more grain per person than the heavily affected cooperatives. However, local cadres did not provide them with sufficient support when distributing relief grain. From June 18th to August 14th, the Democratic First Cooperative, which was heavily affected, received 130,245 jin of relief grain, averaging more than 42 jin per person, while the Peace First Cooperative received 75,685 jin of government relief grain during the same period, averaging only ten and a half jin per person. At the same time, local areas did not pay enough attention to lightly affected cooperatives when assigning cadres to lead disaster-stricken people in carrying out production for self-salvation, and fewer capable cadres were assigned. In the heavily affected Democratic First Cooperative, in addition to a district-level cadre dispatched by the county to reside in the cooperative, the district and township also regularly had six people in the cooperative to grasp the disaster situation and assist in the work. In contrast, only one propaganda cadre from the district was assigned to the Peace First Cooperative, and this cadre had already taken sick leave and returned home, so there was actually no one to assist in the work.

Due to the relaxation of leadership in the lightly affected cooperatives, while the two heavily affected cooperatives successfully completed the mid-autumn and late autumn crop sowing plans, the Peace First Cooperative only completed 85% of the plan.

Because the Peace First Cooperative's agricultural and sideline production was not well-managed, the number of people who rely on production for self-salvation to solve the grain shortage currently accounts for only 18% of the population lacking grain. The two heavily affected cooperatives, due to their better agricultural and sideline production, were able to reach 32% of the population lacking grain. Therefore, in its report to the Provincial People's Committee, the Department of Civil Affairs requested that leaders at all levels in disaster areas, while strengthening leadership in heavily affected areas, immediately strengthen leadership and support for lightly affected areas.

### 安徽省民政厅检查灾区工作后提出报告  不能放松领导轻灾区生产自救工作

    安徽省民政厅检查灾区工作后提出报告
    不能放松领导轻灾区生产自救工作
    新华社合肥6日电　新华社记者龚浩报道：在加强领导重灾区生产救灾的同时，不能忽视轻灾区。这是安徽省民政厅工作组最近在灾区实地调查后提出的一个必须注意的问题。这个工作组最近在涡阳县板集区调查了三个受灾程度不同的农业生产合作社，调查的结果表明，由于放松了对轻灾区的领导，在受灾较重的民主一社、民主二社灾情平稳的情况下，受灾轻的和平一社，灾情却反而有了发展。
    在重灾社所没有发现的出卖旧家具、旧衣服的现象，在轻灾的和平一社开始发现。
    和平一社夏季实收粮食十一万零七百一十六斤，平均每人所得粮食，只比重灾社多十余斤。但是当地干部在发放救济粮时对它们的支持不够。在6月18日到8月14日的这段时间内，救济重灾的民主一社的粮食是十三万零二百四十五斤，全社平均每人为四十二斤多，而和平一社在这同一时间里，得到政府救济的粮食是七万五千六百八十五斤，全社平均每人只有十斤半。同时，当地在配备干部领导灾民开展生产自救时，对轻灾社注意不够，配备的得力干部较少。重灾的民主一社，除县里派一个区级干部住社外，区、乡还经常有六人在社里掌握灾情协助工作。而对和平一社，区里仅派一宣传干事，并且这个干事已因病请假回家，实际上是无人协助工作。
    由于放松了对轻灾社的领导，在两个重灾社胜利完成中秋、晚秋作物播种计划时，和平一社却只完成计划的85％。
    由于和平一社农副业生产搞得不好，目前靠生产自救解决缺粮的人数只占缺粮人口的18％，而两个重灾社由于农副业生产搞得比较好些，靠生产自救解决缺粮的人数能达到缺粮人口的32％。因此，民政厅在向省人民委员会的报告中，要求灾区各级领导在加强对重灾区的领导同时，要立即加强对轻灾区的领导和支持。
