Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 7th. Basic-level election work in Zhejiang Province is being fully rolled out. Eighty-three counties and cities across the province have established election offices.

Since the start of election work in June, 310 townships across the province have completed basic-level elections, with another 321 townships and towns currently underway. In the election work, efforts have generally been made to closely center on production, ensuring simple procedures that are practical. On the basis of promoting democracy and conducting criticism and self-criticism, the masses carefully elected representatives. Recently, the Zhejiang Provincial People's Committee convened a provincial election work conference to summarize the experiences of the previous stage of election work and determine that election work would gradually unfold throughout the province from now on. As Zhejiang Province suffered significant typhoon disasters this year, with heavy tasks in production, disaster relief, and other areas, the conference requested that election work, after being fully launched, must be centered on production and carried out in conjunction with other work, interspersed and intersecting.

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 7th. Heilongjiang Province has launched basic-level election work in 60 counties and cities. The election work in Baiquan, Hailun, Bin County, Shuangyashan and other six counties and cities that started earlier, had already concluded in late August.

In the areas where election activities have already been carried out, the masses are in high spirits. When Nanyang Village, Baoquan Township, Bin County, held an election meeting, all 110 voters in the village happily gathered at the venue to participate in the election in less than the time it takes to eat a meal. Thirty-six women in this village even changed into new clothes to participate in the election.

This year, some counties and districts in Heilongjiang Province have been affected by floods, and the election work in some disaster-stricken areas has paid attention to combining it with helping the masses to resume production, rebuild their homes, and help themselves. Some land in Tuanjie Township, Suihua County, was affected by the disaster. The cadres in charge of election work, in light of the masses' thinking, put forward the slogan of draining water and preventing waterlogging, striving for a bumper harvest, and welcoming the election, and organized village cadres to mobilize the masses to drain water and rescue farmland, so that most of the 200 hectares of disaster-stricken land in this township were saved, and the masses' spirits quickly improved.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 7th. Nearly 800,000 voters in Guangzhou participated in basic-level election activities. As of the 5th, all voting in the city had been completed, and representatives to the Second Municipal People's Congresses of each district in the city were elected.

Among the people's representatives elected from various districts, 717 were newly emerged workers, peasants, returned overseas Chinese and their families, waterfront residents, workers in culture, education, and health, and positive elements in socialist construction in the business community. Many representatives to the first People's Congress who were deeply loved by the masses were re-elected as representatives this time.

Voters from all strata of the city also put forward many criticisms and suggestions on the shortcomings of the work of the government and various departments during this election activity. Returned overseas Chinese and their families living in Dongshan and Overseas Chinese New Village criticized the shortcomings of some state-owned commercial departments and medical institutions personnel for being detached from the masses and not caring enough about people's lives and health, and suggested that relevant departments improve the supply of non-staple foods. More than 10,000 voters who have lived on the Pearl River for a long time also criticized some cadres of the local public security police station and offices for their bureaucratic and coercive command style. More than 5,000 pieces of comprehensive opinions and suggestions put forward by voters in various districts have been handed over by the Guangzhou City and district election committees to relevant departments for handling.

    浙江黑龙江全面开始基层选举
    广州选出了市内各区第二届人民代表大会代表
    据新华社杭州7日电　浙江省基层选举工作正在全面展开。全省已经有八十三个县、市成立了选举办公室。
    从6月份开始选举工作以来，全省已经有三百十个乡完成了基层选举，还有三百二十一个乡、镇正在进行。在选举工作中，一般都是紧密的围绕生产，做到了手续简便，切合实际。在发扬民主、开展批评与自我批评的基础上，群众慎重地评选了代表。最近，浙江省人民委员会召开了全省选举工作会议，总结了前一阶段选举工作的经验，确定选举工作将要从现在起在全省范围内逐步展开。由于浙江省今年遭受了巨大的台风灾害，生产、救灾及其他各项工作任务繁重，因此会议要求选举工作在全面展开后，必须围绕生产、结合其他工作穿插、交叉进行。
    新华社哈尔滨7日电　黑龙江省已经在六十个县、市开展了基层选举工作。开始较早的拜泉、海伦、宾县、双鸭山等六个县、市的选举工作，已经在8月下旬结束。
    在已经开展选举活动的地方，群众情绪都较高。宾县宝泉乡南洋村举行选举大会时，全村一百一十名选民兴高采烈，不到一顿饭功夫，就集合到会场上参加选举。这个村有三十六名妇女还换上新衣服参加选举。
    今年黑龙江省有部分县、区受到洪水灾害，一些受灾地区的选举工作，都注意结合帮助群众生产自救重建家园工作进行。绥化县团结乡有一部分土地受到灾害。担任选举工作的干部针对群众思想情况，提出了排水防涝、争取丰收、迎接选举的口号，并且组织村干部发动群众排水抢救农田，使这个乡二百垧受灾田地大部分得救，群众情绪很快地提高了。
    据新华社广州7日电　广州市内近八十万选民参加了基层选举活动。到5日止全市已经全部投票完毕，选出了市内各区第二届人民代表大会的代表。
    各区，这次选出的人民代表中就有七百一十七人是在近年来新涌现出来的工人、农民、归国华侨和华侨家属、水上居民、文教卫生工作者及工商界等各方面的社会主义建设积极分子。很多深受群众爱戴的第一届人民代表大会的代表，这次都被继续选举为代表。
    全市各阶层的选民在这次选举活动中，还对政府及各部门工作的缺点提出了许多批评和建议。聚居在东山和华侨新村的归国华侨和华侨家属们，曾批评了有些国营商业部门和医疗机构工作人员脱离群众和不够关心人民生活、健康的缺点，并建议有关部门改进副食品的供应工作。一万多名长期居住在珠江水上的选民，还对当地公安派出所及办事处有些干部官僚主义、强迫命令作风进行了批评。各区选民提出的五千多件综合意见和建议，已经由广州市及各区选举委员会分别交给有关部门处理。
