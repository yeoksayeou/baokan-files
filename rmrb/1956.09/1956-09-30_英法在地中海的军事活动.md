    Xinhua News Agency, Malta, September 28th: While Britain and France submitted the Suez issue to the United Nations Security Council, the two countries continued to take military intimidation actions in the Mediterranean region. Three French landing ships carrying army tanks left Malta on the 27th and sailed to Cyprus and another British and French troop assembly point. At the same time, the British and French fleets in the Mediterranean are preparing for joint exercises. To this end, the British aircraft carriers "Eagle" and "Bulwark", the light cruisers "Duchess" and "Diamond", and two other fast ships will arrive in Marseille on the 28th.
    Not many days ago, a French fleet consisting of sixteen warships also conducted exercises in the Mediterranean Sea adjacent to the North African coast.

    新华社28日讯　马耳他消息：同英法把苏伊士问题提交联合国安全理事会的同时，两国继续在地中海地区采取军事恫吓行动。三艘装载陆军坦克的法国登陆舰在27日离开马耳他驶向塞浦路斯和另一处英法军队的集结地。同时，英法在地中海的舰队正在准备举行联合演习。为此，英国航空母舰“鹰号”和“堡垒号”，轻巡洋舰“女公爵号”和“金钢石号”以及另外两艘快速舰将在28日到达马赛。
    不多几天以前，一个由十六艘战舰组成的法国舰队也曾经在邻近北非海岸的地中海中进行了演习。
