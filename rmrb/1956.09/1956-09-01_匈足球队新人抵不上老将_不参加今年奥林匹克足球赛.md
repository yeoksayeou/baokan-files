Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 31st August: According to a report by the Hungarian News Agency, the Hungarian team, the previous Olympic football champion, has decided not to participate in this year's Olympic football tournament.

    This decision was made by the Hungarian Olympic Committee on August 30th. The reasons for not participating are the reorganization of the football team and its poor performance in various international competitions this year.

    The Hungarian team won the football championship at the previous Olympic Games and defeated the British professional football team 6-3 in Britain in 1953. This was the first time in ninety years that the British football team had lost to a foreign football team on home soil.

    The Hungarian football team is characterized by its speed, good technique, unexpected tactics, and ability to launch a barrage of attacks. However, recently, the main players in the Hungarian team have all passed the age of thirty, and their speed has been affected. The new forces have not yet fully matured enough to replace the veterans. They are not calm and composed enough on the field, especially in terms of organizing attacks, and are not as good as the veterans. Therefore, this year they lost 1-3 to the Turkish team, 2-4 to the Czechoslovak team, and then drew with the less-strong Portuguese team.

### 匈足球队新人抵不上老将  不参加今年奥林匹克足球赛

    匈足球队新人抵不上老将
    不参加今年奥林匹克足球赛
    新华社布拉格31日电　据匈牙利通讯社消息，上届奥林匹克运动会足球冠军匈牙利队决定不参加今年奥林匹克运动会的足球赛。
    这个决定是匈牙利奥林匹克委员会在8月30日作出的。不参加的原因是足球队要改组以及它在今年的各次国际比赛中成绩不好。
    匈牙利队曾经在上届奥林匹克运动会上获得了足球冠军，1953年又在英国以六比三战胜英国职业足球队。在九十年中，英国足球队在本土上输给外国足球队这还是第一次。
    匈牙利足球队的特点是速度快，技术好，打法出奇，并且有连珠发射的本领。但是，最近匈牙利队内主将都已年过三十岁，速度受到影响，新生力量还没有完全成熟到足以接替老将的程度。他们上场不够从容镇静，特别是在组织攻势方面不如老将，所以今年曾以一比三输给土耳其队，二比四输给捷克斯洛伐克队，随后又同水平不高的葡萄牙队打成平局。
