Earnestly Implement the Policy of Reducing and Exempting Cultural and Entertainment Tax
\t*People's Daily* Commentator

After the state promulgated the Cultural and Entertainment Tax Regulations and the instructions to exempt seven categories of cultural and entertainment activities, including opera, drama, play, dance, music, ballads, and acrobatics, from cultural and entertainment tax for two years, the vast majority of regions across the country reduced and exempted cultural and entertainment tax in accordance with the provisions of the regulations. As a result, the broad masses of artists increased their income and their lives improved. They thanked the government for its care for the art industry and the lives of artists.

However, in individual regions, the order to reduce and exempt cultural and entertainment tax has not been correctly implemented. For example, after reducing and exempting cultural and entertainment tax, the Wenchang County Tax Bureau on Hainan Island concocted various pretexts to levy "income tax" on theatrical troupes. The *New Hunan Daily* only published the tax reduction regulations but did not publish the two-year tax exemption instructions, so until the Dragon Boat Festival, various counties in Hunan were still collecting taxes as usual and not granting exemptions. Although the above errors were discovered and corrected by relevant departments, such cases cannot be said to be unique. In fact, the situation of only reducing but not exempting exists in other regions as well, which deserves attention.

As for some cultural departments, they do not fully understand the purpose of the state's reduction and exemption of cultural and entertainment tax. The Cultural and Educational Section of Xiaofeng County, Zhejiang Province, ordered the county's New New Theater to lower ticket prices after exempting entertainment tax. The original daytime price of 15 fen and nighttime price of 20 fen were reduced to 12 fen and 16 fen, respectively, after the tax exemption. The Yichang City Cultural and Educational Bureau in Hubei Province also ordered the Heping Han Opera Troupe to lower ticket prices, from 25 fen to 20 fen and from 20 fen to 18 fen. Not long ago, the "Stage and Audience" bimonthly published in Guangzhou published a short commentary entitled "Improve Quality, Lower Ticket Prices, Respond to the State's Measures to Reduce and Temporarily Exempt Cultural and Entertainment Tax for Opera, etc.," calling on opera troupes to generally lower ticket prices. The reasons were: on the one hand, to "reduce the burden on the audience," and on the other hand, to prevent "some people from thinking that they can sit back and relax and not seek progress." These reasons are obviously one-sided.

"Reducing the burden on the audience" is generally a good thing to say. However, the current ticket prices for opera performances across the country are not particularly high. The lives of the broad masses of artists are not above the general living standards of the people but are very poor, even unable to maintain a minimum standard of living. If ticket prices are lowered as soon as cultural and entertainment tax is reduced and exempted, making it impossible to improve the lives of artists, this violates the spirit of the state's policy of reducing and exempting cultural and entertainment tax. After lowering ticket prices in Xiaofeng County, Zhejiang Province, the artists could not even raise enough money for mobile performances. As for the argument of preventing some people from "sitting back and relaxing and not seeking progress," it exposes these people's contempt and distrust of artists. In fact, the broad masses of artists across the country are responding to the state's concern for them with actions to improve quality and strengthen artistic practice, and are by no means "sitting back and relaxing"!

Some places allocate too much of the income obtained after the reduction and exemption of cultural and entertainment tax to the theater troupe's construction funds, which is also incorrect. Of course, in order to develop the theater troupe's business and improve operations, it is permissible to appropriately extract a portion of the tax-exempt income as the theater troupe's capital accumulation; however, it must be with the consent of the theater troupe's actors and staff, and the lives of the artists should be guaranteed first. Because if the lives of the actors are not appropriately improved, they cannot perform well, and there can be no talk of the theater troupe's development.

It should be pointed out that the spirit of the state's reduction and exemption of cultural and entertainment tax is mainly to increase the income of theater troupes, improve the lives of artists, increase the enthusiasm of artists, and encourage theater troupes to improve management and strengthen artistic practice, in order to develop the art industry. Because the state reduces cultural and entertainment tax, taking other measures to reduce the income of theater troupes or increase the economic burden on theater troupes and artists, making it impossible to improve the lives of artists, thereby affecting their enthusiasm for artistic activities, is contrary to the government's original intention of caring for artists and the art industry.

    认真执行减免文化娱乐税的政策
    本报评论员
    在国家公布了文化娱乐税条例和免征戏曲、话剧、歌剧、舞蹈，音乐、曲艺、杂技等七项文化娱乐税两年的指示以后，全国绝大部分地区都按着条令的规定，减征和免征了文化娱乐税，广大艺人因之增加了收入，生活得到了改善，他们感谢政府对艺术事业和艺人生活的关怀。
    但是，在个别地区减免文化娱乐税的命令还没有得到正确的贯彻。如海南岛文昌县税务局在减免文化娱乐税以后，又巧立名目，向剧团征收“所得税”；“新湖南报”只登了减税条令，而未登免税两年的指示，因而一直到端午节以前，湖南各县还在照常征税，不予豁免。上述错误虽经有关部门发现后作了纠正，但是这种事例，却不能说是绝无仅有的。事实上，只减不免的情形，在别的地区也是有的，值得引起注意。
    就某些文化部门来说，对国家减免文化娱乐税的目的，也不是都完全了解了的。浙江省孝丰县文教科就在免征娱乐税以后，命令该县新新剧院降低票价。原来日场一角五分、夜场两角，免税后日场便降为一角二分、夜场一角六分。湖北省宜昌市文教局也曾命令和平汉剧团降低票价，原来两角五分的降低为两角；原来两角的降为一角八分。不久前广州出版的“舞台与观众”半月刊，发表了一篇题为“提高质量、降低票价，响应国家降低和暂时免征戏曲等文化娱乐税的措施”的短评，号召戏曲剧团普遍降低票价。那理由是：一方面可以“减轻观众的负担”，另一方面，也可以防止“某些人以为从此可以
  ‘高枕无忧’‘优哉游哉’而不求上进”，这些理由，显然都是片面的。
      “减轻观众的负担”，这话一般说是不错的。但是，目前全国戏曲演出的票价并不怎样偏高，广大艺人的生活，不是处在一般人民生活水平以上，而是十分清苦，甚至不能维持最低限度的生活。如果才减免文化娱乐税，就降低票价，使艺人生活不能改善，这就同国家减免文化娱乐税政策的精神相违背。浙江省孝丰县在降低票价后，艺人们甚至连流动演出的路费都筹措不出。至于说防止某些人的“优哉游哉，而不求上进”的说法，正好暴露了这些人对艺人的轻视和不信任。事实上，全国广大艺人都正在以提高质量，加强艺术实践的行动来回答国家对他们的关怀，而绝不是什么“优哉游哉”！
    有些地方把减免文化娱乐税后的收入所得，过多地留作剧团的建设经费，这也是不对的。当然，为了发展剧团事业，改进业务，适当抽出一部分免税所得作为剧团的资金积累，也是可以的；但是必须经过剧团演员、职员的同意，并且首先应当保障艺人的生活。因为演员的生活如果没有适当的改善，是不能演好戏的，也谈不上剧团的发展。
    应该指出：国家减免文化娱乐税的精神，主要是为了增加剧团的收入，改善艺人的生活，提高艺人的积极性，鼓励剧团改善经营，加强艺术实践，以发展艺术事业。因为国家减低文化娱乐税，就采取其他办法、去减少剧团的收入或者增加剧团和艺人的经济负担，使艺人的生活不能改善，从而影响他们艺术活动的积极性，是和政府关怀艺人和艺术事业的初衷不符的。
