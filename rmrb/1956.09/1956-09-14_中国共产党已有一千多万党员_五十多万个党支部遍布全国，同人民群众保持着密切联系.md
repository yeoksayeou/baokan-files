Xinhua News Agency, September 13th: According to statistics from the Organization Department of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, as of the end of June this year, the Chinese Communist Party has 10,734,384 members, accounting for 1.74% of the total national population. There are more than 538,000 Party branches across the country. Currently, most factories and mines across the country have Party organizations and members. In rural areas, with the exception of a few ethnic minority regions, basically every township has a grassroots Party organization. Party organizations in some later-liberated areas have developed particularly rapidly in the years since liberation. Shanghai, the birthplace of the Chinese Communist Party, had only one thousand Communist Party members when the Seventh National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party was held in 1945. By the end of June this year, the city had more than 152,000 Communist Party members.

In ethnic minority areas, Party organizations have also experienced significant development. Currently, Party organizations have been established among all the more populous ethnic groups. According to 1955 statistics, there were more than 290,000 Communist Party members from ethnic minorities across the country. This year, the number of Communist Party members from ethnic minorities in Qinghai Province has increased four and a half times compared to two years ago. The four pastoral counties of the Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in this province have been establishing grassroots Party organizations among ethnic minorities since the second half of last year, and now most districts have established branches. The Oroqen people, who live in the cold Xing'an Mountains and make a living by hunting, have a population of only over two thousand. In 1955, fourteen outstanding members of this ethnic group joined the Chinese Communist Party.

The Party's composition is mainly workers, peasants, and intellectuals. Among the more than ten million Communist Party members, 1.5 million are workers, accounting for 14% of the total number of Party members; 7.41 million are peasants, accounting for 69.1% of the total number of Party members. Among the peasant Party members, 5.36 million are from poor peasant backgrounds, and 2.05 million are from middle peasant backgrounds (mainly new middle peasants and lower-middle peasants who have risen from poor peasant backgrounds); 1.25 million are intellectual Party members, accounting for 11.7% of the total number of Party members. In the first half of this year, Party organizations at all levels also accepted 2,592 senior intellectuals into the Party. In addition, 550,000 Party members are from other backgrounds, accounting for 5.2% of the total number of Party members. A large number of outstanding women and young people, under the education of the Communist Party, have raised their awareness and joined the Party organization. According to 1955 statistics, there were 940,000 female Communist Party members across the country, accounting for over 10% of the total number of Party members at that time. In Shanghai, female Communist Party members account for over 24% of the total number of Party members. In the high tide of the socialist revolution movement, more and more young people are joining the Chinese Communist Party. In the first half of this year, more than 650,000 members of the Communist Youth League joined the Communist Party. The number of Communist Youth League members who joined the Communist Party in the second quarter of this year increased more than threefold compared to the first quarter.

Since the Seventh National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party in April 1945, the Party's organization has continuously developed and grown. At the time of the Seventh National Congress, there were 1.21 million Communist Party members nationwide. By the time the People's Republic of China was founded in 1949, the Chinese Communist Party had 3.27 million more members than in 1945. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the broad masses of people raised their political awareness in movements such as the reform of the land system, the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and the resistance against U.S. aggression and aid to Korea, and joined the Communist Party one after another. In the three years from 1950 to 1952, the number of Chinese Communist Party members increased by 1.5 million compared to 1949. In recent years, during the large-scale economic construction, especially since the high tide of agricultural and handicraft cooperation and the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce in 1955, Party organizations at all levels have accepted a large number of outstanding members into the Communist Party. Currently, the number of members of the Chinese Communist Party has increased by more than 4.73 million compared to 1952, the year before the start of the First Five-Year Plan.

Currently, among the more than ten million Communist Party members across the country, there are more than 1.12 million in industry, more than 230,000 in transportation, more than 6.21 million in agriculture, more than 530,000 in finance and trade, more than 410,000 in cultural and educational undertakings, and a large number of Communist Party members in other undertakings as well. The Party organizations and Party members maintain close ties with the broad masses of people and play a significant role in the country's socialist construction and socialist transformation.

    中国共产党已有一千多万党员
    五十多万个党支部遍布全国，同人民群众保持着密切联系
    新华社13日讯　据中国共产党中央组织部统计，到今年6月底，中国共产党已有一千零七十三万四千三百八十四名党员，占全国人口总数的1.74％；全国有五十三万八千多个党的支部。现在全国工厂、矿山中一般都有了党的组织和党员。在农村，除少数民族地区外，基本上每个乡都有党的基层组织；有些晚解放区的党组织，在解放后的几年中发展得特别迅速。中国共产党的诞生地上海，在1945年召开中国共产党第七次全国代表大会时，只有一千名共产党员，到今年6月底，全市已有十五万二千多名共产党员。
    在少数民族地区，党的组织也有了很大的发展。现在，在各个人口较多的民族当中都建立了党的组织。据1955年的统计，全国少数民族中有二十九万多名共产党员，今年青海省少数民族中的共产党员，已比两年前增加了四倍半。这个省的海南藏族自治州的四个牧业县，从去年下半年开始在少数民族中建立党的基层组织以来，现在大部分的区已经建立了支部。居住在寒冷的兴安岭上以打猎为生的鄂伦春族，人口只有二千多，在1955年，这个民族中就有十四名优秀分子加入了中国共产党。
    党的成份主要是工人，农民和知识分子。在一千零七十多万共产党员中，工人成份的党员有一百五十万，占党员总数的14％；农民成份的有七百四十一万，占党员总数的69.1％；在农民党员中，贫民成份的有五百三十六万，中农（主要是由贫农上升的新中农和下中农）成份的有二百零五万；知识分子党员有一百二十五万，占党员总数的11.7％；今年上半年，中共各级组织还接收了二千五百九十二名高级知识分子入党；另外，其他成份的党员五十五万，占党员总数的5.2％。大批优秀的妇女和青年在共产党的教育下，提高了觉悟，加入了党的组织。据1955年的统计，全国有九十四万名女共产党员，占当时党员总数的10％强。在上海，女共产党员占党员总数的24％强。在社会主义革命运动高潮中，青年加入中国共产党的越来越多。今年上半年有六十五万多名青年团员加入了共产党。今年第二季度加入共产党的青年团员比第一季度增加了两倍多。
    从1945年4月中国共产党第七次全国代表大会以来，党的组织不断地得到发展和壮大。在第七次全国代表大会时期，全国有共产党员一百二十一万人。到1949年中华人民共和国成立时，中国共产党拥有的党员比1945年增加了三百二十七万多名。中华人民共和国成立后，广大群众在改革土地制度，镇压反革命，抗美援朝等运动中提高了政治觉悟，纷纷加入共产党。在1950年到1952年的三年中，中国共产党党员又比1949年增加了一百五十万名。在最近几年大规模的经济建设中，特别从1955年的农业和手工业的合作化以及对私营工商业进行社会主义改造的高潮以来，中共各级组织又接收了大批的优秀分子参加共产党。目前，中国共产党的党员数目已经比第一个五年计划开始前一年——1952年，增加了四百七十三万多人。
    现在，全国一千零七十多万共产党员分布在工业方面的有一百一十二万多名，在交通运输业方面的有二十三万多名，在农业方面的有六百二十一万多名，在财经贸易方面的有五十三万多名，在文化教育事业方面的有四十一万多名，在其他事业方面也都有大批共产党员。党的组织和党员同广大人民群众保持着密切的联系，在国家的社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业中起着重大的作用。
