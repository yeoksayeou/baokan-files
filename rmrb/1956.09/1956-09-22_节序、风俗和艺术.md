    Festivals, Customs, and Art
    Xiao Li
    Not long ago, my long-separated younger brother returned from military leave. After dinner, the whole family sat on the balcony, enjoying the cool air and chatting idly. My brother showed off his astronomical knowledge, pointing out constellations in the sky and naming them. When he pointed to the stars of the Milky Way, everyone suddenly remembered that it was the Qixi Festival, the Double Seventh Festival. It was true, we hadn't sat together as a family to enjoy a festival like this in years. As if everyone felt it at the same time, we all looked at the stars of the Milky Way. After a moment of silence, my brother broke the silence, looked at me and said with a smile:
    "Do you remember? The year I was about to start elementary school, during the Qixi Festival, you taught me a poem about the Double Seventh: 'Silver candle casts autumn light on painted screen cold, Light silk fan to catch fireflies bold, Night on heavenly street is cool as stream, I lie and watch Cowherd, Weaver Girl dream.' I can still recite it now."
    That was more than ten years ago.
    We recalled the scenes of celebrating the Qixi Festival when we were children: recalling the beautiful stories of the Cowherd and the Weaver Girl told to me by the old nanny, and then immediately retold by me to my younger brothers; recalling how on the night of the Qixi Festival, the girls would earnestly sit under the grape trellis, trying to eavesdrop on the whispers of the Cowherd and the Weaver Girl, while the boys would eagerly make trouble for the girls;… These are such fond and emotional memories. Even now, these memories are preserved in our hearts as vividly as they were in our childhood.
    This memory triggered a series of memories of festivals from our childhood: the Spring Festival, revered as the crown of all festivals, was the most lively. New Year's Eve and New Year's Day were spent sleeplessly, reveling until dawn. "Girls wanted flowers, boys wanted firecrackers." The girls put on new clothes and wore flowers in their hair, while the boys ran around with firecrackers. The Lantern Festival on the fifteenth day of the first month was the climax of the entire Spring Festival. "The flower market's lights are as bright as day," "The east wind releases a thousand trees of flowers," "Fish and dragons dance all night long." The children never tired of watching and were overjoyed. The Dragon Boat Festival on the fifth day of the fifth month was marked by the ubiquitous mugwort leaves, dragon boat races, children with realgar dotted on their foreheads, and girls skillfully making various colorful rice dumplings and sachets. On the Ghost Festival on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, children walked in the moonlight, holding lanterns. The most captivating were the lotus lanterns with candles lit in the lotus flowers and on the lotus leaves. The Mid-Autumn Festival on the fifteenth day of the eighth month featured the unique, humorous, and heartwarming Grandpa Rabbit and Grandma Rabbit, who were the children's good friends. … The joys of these festivals were truly countless.
    These enriched our childhood lives, brought us immense joy, and painted our childhood lives with enchanting colors.
    These allowed our young hearts to first encounter "art," to be nurtured by art, cultivated our sense of art, and enriched our emotional lives. The paper cuttings pasted on doors and windows during the New Year, the lanterns held high everywhere during the Lantern and Ghost Festivals, the clay rabbits of the Mid-Autumn Festival… cultivated our ability to appreciate color and our love of beauty. As for the various legends and myths of the festivals: the story of the White Snake during the Dragon Boat Festival, the story of the Cowherd and the Weaver Girl during the Qixi Festival…, although at the time, we could not understand the full meaning of the story, nor could we understand the deep love between a man and a woman who disregarded life and death, and whose "hearts, if they truly understand, need not meet day after day," but pure and compassionate children, while listening to the stories with tears in their eyes, so hated the "meddlesome" and cruel Fahai, and so pitied the White Snake who was forever suppressed under the Leifeng Pagoda; so cursed the Queen Mother who used her hairpin to separate the Milky Way, and so sympathized with the Cowherd and the Weaver Girl who were blocked on either side of the Milky Way and met only once a year, and especially the two children carried by the Cowherd, who often did not see their mother; so rejoiced at the loyal old ox and the kind magpies. Children used their own simple but clear-cut eyes to sympathize and hate, and to experience with another kind of childlike love the kind of love they could not understand. These stories still evoked another kind of poetry and charm in the hearts of children. These enriched the children's emotions, expanded their imaginations, and broadened the scope of their lives. And I, it was from here that I began to love literature and love art.
    These joyful festival experiences that once captivated and fascinated my childhood are now preserved very, very little. What remains are only the New Year's Day holiday and some culinary enjoyment: glutinous rice balls, rice dumplings, mooncakes. Occasionally, when those beautiful scenes are mentioned, today's children listen with wide-eyed surprise and open mouths, as if they are listening to some legend or fairy tale. Of course, today's children have their own lives: nurseries, children's parks, children's books, children's films, plays… Their lives are richer, happier, and more splendid than our past lives, not just by a hundredfold. Looking at them, we often feel regret and resentment for our own dim childhood. However, in some aspects, such as the joy of this splendid festival life, the experience of these Chinese legends and myths, and the enjoyment of this delicate beauty full of Chinese flavor, it has been simplified and impoverished. Every year when I see the children of Moscow, Soviet Union, celebrating the Fir Tree Festival in the Kremlin, I always think, why don't we also promote it? So many different kinds of festivals, so many different kinds of festival joys, so many different kinds of gentle and beautiful legends, so many different kinds of charming arts, why not pass on the healthy, interesting, and non-superstitious parts to our next generation, so that the lives of our next generation can be richer and more beautiful?

    节序、风俗和艺术
    晓立
    不久之前，久别的弟弟从部队休假回来，吃过晚饭，全家坐在阳台上纳凉闲话。弟弟炫耀他的天文知识，指点着天上的星座，数说着它们的名称，指点到银河双星，大家才突然记起这天正是七月七日乞巧节。真的，好几年不曾这样全家坐在一处享受这种过佳节的乐趣了，好似大家都同时感觉到了这一点，不约而同地都望着银河双星。沉默了一下之后，弟弟打破了沉默，望着我笑着说道：
    “你还记得吗？我要进小学的那年乞巧节，你教了我一首七夕的诗：银烛秋光冷画屏，轻罗小扇扑流萤，天街夜色凉如水，卧看牵牛织女星。我到现在还能背得出来。”
    那是十多年前的事了。
    我们回忆起了幼小时候过乞巧节的情景：回忆起那些由年老的奶妈讲给我，而又由我马上转讲给弟弟们听的牛郎织女的美丽的故事；回忆起乞巧节那天晚上，女孩子们热心地坐到葡萄架下，想去偷听牛郎织女的私语，而男孩子却是热心地向女孩子捣乱；……这是多么亲切的充满感情的回忆。直到现在，这些回忆还以童年当时的鲜明生动保存在我们心里。
    这个回忆，引起了我们一连串童年时代节日的回忆：尊为诸节之冠的春节，是最热闹的节日，除夕、元旦，彻夜不寐，狂欢达旦，“姑娘要花，小子要炮”，姑娘们穿上新衣，插上花朵，男孩子们手提鞭炮到处奔跑。正月十五上元节，是整个春节的压尾，“花市灯如昼”、“东风夜放花千树”、“一夜鱼龙舞”，孩子们真是百看不厌、欢喜若狂。五月初五端午节，艾叶遍插，龙舟竞渡，孩子们额头点上雄黄，姑娘们巧手做着各种彩色粽子、香囊。七月十五盂兰节，孩子们踏着月光，擎举着灯笼，最引人入胜的是荷花中、荷叶上点燃起蜡烛的莲灯。八月十五中秋节，那别致的、极富幽默感、人情味的兔爷爷、兔奶奶，更是孩子们的好朋友。……这些佳节乐趣真是数不尽的。
    这些，丰富了我们的童年生活，给我们的童年生活带来了巨大的快乐，为我们的童年生活渲染了魅人的色彩。
    这些，使我们幼小的心灵第一次接触了“艺术”，受到了艺术的陶冶，培养了我们艺术的感觉，丰富了我们的感情生活。那新年中门窗遍贴的剪纸，那上元、盂兰到处高擎的花灯，那中秋的泥兔……，培育了我们对于色彩的欣赏能力、对于美的爱好。对于节日的各种传说，神话：端午节白蛇传的故事，乞巧节牛郎织女的故事……，虽然在当时，我们并不能明白那故事的全部意义，不能懂得那种不顾生死的、“两情若是久长时，又岂在朝朝暮暮”的深挚的男女爱情，但是，纯真而富于同情心的儿童，在含着眼泪听完故事的时候，是多么痛恨那“多管闲事”、残忍无情的法海，多么怜悯那永远被镇在雷峰塔下的白蛇；多么咒诅那用簪子划隔了天河的王母娘娘，多么同情那被阻在天河两旁、一年一度一相会的牛郎织女，而尤其是那牛郎担挑着的、经常看不到妈妈的两个小孩，多么欢喜那忠诚的老牛、好心的喜鹊。儿童是以儿童自己那种简单可是是非分明的眼光来同情着、憎恨着，以另一种儿童的爱来体会他们所不能理解的那种爱情。这些故事在儿童心里仍然发生了另一种诗情和魅力。这些，使孩子们丰富了感情，扩大了想像，拓开了生活的范围。而我，就是从这里开始爱上了文学、爱上了艺术的。
    这些，曾使我童年沉醉着迷的节日的欢乐，今天却保留得非常非常之少了，留下的，不过是元旦的假期和一些口腹的享受：汤元、棕子、月饼。偶然，讲起那些胜景，今天的孩子们听起来，惊奇地睁大眼睛、张开嘴巴，好像是听什么传说、童话。当然，今天的孩子们有他们的生活：托儿所、儿童公园、儿童读物、儿童电影、话剧……，他们的生活比我们过去的生活丰富、幸福、光彩何止百倍，看着他们，我们常为自己黯淡的童年感到遗憾和委屈。但是，在有些方面，比如这种绚烂的节日生活的快乐，这种中国自己的传说、神话的体会，这种充满中国风味的精致的美感享受，却是简单化了、贫乏了。每年我看到苏联莫斯科孩子们在克里姆林宫欢度枞树节的时候，我总是想，为什么我们不也提倡起来呢？那么多种多样的节日，那么多种多样节日的欢乐，那么多种多样温柔美丽的传说，那么多种多样魅人的艺术，为什么不把那健康的、有趣的、而不带封建迷信色彩的部分传给我们的下一代，使我们下一代的生活更丰富、更美丽呢？
