Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, September 6th: More than fifty returned overseas Chinese from Japan have been properly resettled in Shanghai recently. Among these returned overseas Chinese, those who are employable have been assigned to work in factories, commerce, or maritime transport departments. Song Yiming, who has research experience in machinery, has been assigned to the Daan Machine Factory as a technician. Wang Cunlong works as a technician at the Da Zhonghua Rubber Factory, and his wife, who was originally a medical worker, has also been assigned to work in the same factory's clinic. They are all very grateful for the government's care.

These returned overseas Chinese were all born in Taiwan, and most of them have lived in Japan for more than ten years. They long for the construction of the motherland and returned to the motherland with their families this time. Before they came to Shanghai, the government had already found housing for them and prepared the necessary furniture and daily necessities. Now all their maternity and medical expenses are also subsidized by the government.

In recent years, more than 800 overseas Chinese returning from Japan have come to Shanghai. All those who are employable have been employed, and the government has also helped their families create employment opportunities. Among them, about 40 people have been elected as advanced workers and outstanding workers due to their good production performance.

    最近从日本归国的华侨已在上海得到妥善安置
    新华社上海6日电　最近从日本回国的五十多名华侨，已经在上海得到了妥善安置。这批归国华侨当中，凡是有就业条件的都已分配到工厂、商业或海运部门工作。对机械有研究的宋义明，被分配到大安机器厂担任技术员。王村隆在大中华橡胶厂做技工，他的妻子原来是个医务人员，也被分配在同一个厂的医务室工作。他们都很感激政府的照顾。
    这批归国华侨都是生长在台湾的，大多数人侨居日本有十多年。他们向往祖国的建设，这次带着家眷一起回到祖国。在他们还没有来上海以前，政府就为他们找好了住房，备置了必要的家具和日用必需品。现在他们的生育和医疗费用也全部由政府补助。
    几年来，从日本归国来上海的华侨已有八百多人，有就业条件的人都已经全部就业，政府还帮助他们的家属创造了就业条件。他们当中约有四十人由于生产成绩良好而当选为先进工作者和优秀工作者。
