Why Has the Total Income of Agricultural and Sideline Occupations in Hang County Decreased Year by Year
Yang Cheng

Hang County, Zhejiang Province, has always been a comprehensive agricultural production area. The masses have a habit of engaging in diverse economic activities, with more than 70 kinds of agricultural and sideline products. Taking 1953, when production was relatively normal, as an example, out of the total annual income of over 43.8 million yuan from agriculture and sideline occupations in the county, the output value of grain accounted for 38.35%; industrial raw materials accounted for 16.46%; oil crops accounted for 2.69%; local specialties (including tea, various fruits, melons, vegetables, medicinal materials, etc.) accounted for 28.89%; aquatic products accounted for 4.93%; livestock and poultry accounted for 6.07%; and handicrafts accounted for 2.61%.

In the rural production of Hang County, industrial raw materials and local specialties account for a large proportion, while grain accounts for a relatively small proportion. This is inseparable from its natural conditions.

What are the characteristics of Hang County's natural conditions?

First, it is close to large cities, and developing a diversified economy can meet the needs of urban industrial raw materials and the broad masses of people for non-staple foods, with no problem in sales.

Second, it has mountains and rivers, a dense river network, convenient irrigation, and fertile land. The area near the Qiantang River is sandy, suitable for developing cotton and hemp production; the water network area along the canal has many fish ponds, suitable for developing inland fish farming and planting fruit trees; and there are also some low loess mountains, suitable for planting tea trees.

Third, there is little land and a large population, with an average of only a little more than one mu of grain crop area per person. Therefore, the land utilization rate has always been high, and farmers are more willing to grow cash crops and local specialties.

However, in recent years, although grain production in Hang County has increased year by year, the total output value of agricultural and sideline occupations has decreased year by year.

The total output value of agricultural and sideline occupations in the county was more than 45 million yuan in 1952, more than 43.8 million yuan in 1953, more than 35.9 million yuan in 1954, and more than 43.7 million yuan in 1955. Except for 1954, which was affected by a major flood, the figure for 1955 was 3% lower than in 1952 and 0.23% lower than in 1953; if calculated at the constant prices of 1952 and 1953, the total output value of agricultural and sideline occupations in 1955 was 6.05% lower than in 1952 and 4.85% lower than in 1953.

Why has the total output value of agriculture in Hang County decreased year by year?

The Provincial Party Committee and the County Party Committee have a tendency towards simplification in leading production. They have emphasized the production of grain, cotton, hemp, and oil crops included in the national plan, while neglecting local specialties and sideline production. This is specifically manifested in three aspects:

First, expanding the area of rice, cotton, and hemp squeezed out the planting area of local specialties such as sugarcane, water chestnuts, watermelon, ginger, and medicinal materials. Comparing 1953 and 1955: In 1953, the planting area of various local specialties (excluding fruits) was more than 130,000 mu, with a total output value of more than 7.9 million yuan; in 1955, the planting area of local specialties was only more than 80,000 mu, a decrease of more than 40,000 mu compared with 1953, and the total output value was more than 4 million yuan, a decrease of more than 3.8 million yuan compared with 1953.

Second, although the fruit planting area did not conflict with the rice, cotton, and hemp planting area, due to neglect of leadership and relaxation of cultivation, the planting area also shrank year by year, and the output and quality showed a downward trend. In 1953, the fruit planting area (including loquat, plums, peaches, and persimmons) in the county was more than 24,000 mu, with a unit yield of 810 jin, a total output of more than 190,000 dan, and a total output value of more than 1.4 million yuan; in 1955, the planting area was only more than 22,000 mu, the unit yield dropped to 680 jin, the total output dropped to more than 140,000 dan, and the total output value dropped to more than 900,000 yuan, a decrease of more than 400,000 yuan compared with 1953. The deterioration of fruit quality is also very serious. For example, the famous "Tangqi Loquat" has become sour and not sweet this year. After being transported to Shanghai, it could not be sold. The general public was very disappointed with "Tangqi Loquat," and many shops removed the words "Tangqi."

Third, after the unified purchase and sale of grain, the feed problem has not been well resolved, the price of pork is low (the difference between the purchase price and the selling price is too high), and the cooperatives' valuation of fertilizer for the members is too low. Farmers are far less enthusiastic about raising pigs and sheep than before. Therefore, the number of pigs, sheep, chickens, and ducks in the county has declined sharply. Taking 1953 and 1955 as examples again: In 1953, the number of livestock and poultry was more than 660,000 heads (pieces), with a total output of more than 80,000 dan and a total output value of more than 2.6 million yuan; in 1955, the number of livestock and poultry was only more than 400,000 heads (pieces), with a total output of more than 50,000 dan and the total output value dropped to more than 2.1 million yuan, a decrease of more than 500,000 yuan compared with 1953.

The total output value of the above three aspects decreased by more than 4.8 million yuan in 1955 compared with 1953, while the total output value of grain, cotton, hemp, tea, rapeseed, and silkworm in 1955 increased by only more than 4.5 million yuan compared with 1953. Offsetting the two, the county still had a decrease in income of more than 290,000 yuan.

Another important reason for the year-by-year decline in the total output value of local specialties and rural sideline occupations is that, under the guidance of the idea of unilaterally pursuing high grain yields, the County Party Committee adopted a subjective and arbitrary attitude towards changing the original farming system and production habits, without conducting investigation and research or analyzing the advantages and disadvantages, and forced the masses to implement it. After the water chestnut seedling pulling incident in 1954, more than 10,000 mu of spring flower crops were pulled out again in the spring of 1956 during the change of farming system (changing single-season rice to double-season rice). This caused serious losses to the masses. Some people in Sandun District reflected: "The tears from pulling water chestnut seedlings in 1954 have not yet dried, and now we have to pull rapeseed and broad beans!"

Under the guidance of the above-mentioned erroneous thinking, the leaders of Hang County also adopted many wrong measures to restrict the production of local specialties:

First, they put on big labels politically, saying that growing water chestnuts, sugarcane, ginger and other local specialties with higher incomes was developing capitalism, not obeying the national plan, and that "you eat what you grow!"

Second, they did not supply commercial fertilizers to the land for growing sugarcane, water chestnuts, and watermelons, making these productions unsustainable.

Third, they suppressed prices and increased taxes, making it unprofitable for farmers who grow local specialties. In recent years, the prices of rice, cotton, and hemp have all increased, while the prices of sugarcane, ginger, and loquat have decreased instead. In 1954, the supply and marketing cooperative even used the output value, cost, and net income of cotton and hemp to calculate the price of sugarcane, limiting the purchase price so that the income of sugarcane could not exceed that of ramie; the financial and grain departments also stipulated that every farmer who planted more than one fen of sugarcane had to pay an additional "sugarcane tax" at a progressive tax rate. The county had 16,000 mu of sugarcane that year, and an average of 90 jin of rice was levied per mu as sugarcane tax.

Fourth, they did not provide strong support in terms of purchase, transportation, and sales.

In addition, the subjectivism of the provincial party committee leaders, the lack of systematic investigation and research on the situation in Hang County, and the excessive strictness in the grain issue, requiring a county that has always relied on food supply from other places to meet the requirements of general counties, creating a very tense grain situation in Hang County, this is an important factor that cannot be ignored for the subjectivist errors committed by the Hang County Party Committee in leading production.

×××

In June of this year, at the county-wide Party Congress, the Party's subjectivist and coercive errors in leading agricultural production in the past were reviewed and criticized. Various superior natural conditions in Hang County were analyzed, the good farming systems of the past were preliminarily summarized, and it was confirmed that these good conditions, under the new situation of cooperativization, can be further developed and utilized. The key lies in overcoming subjectivism and bureaucratism in the Party's leadership work, strengthening systematic investigation and research, starting from the actual situation in the locality, and reasonably arranging various productions based on the characteristics of Hang County's agricultural production, so as to ensure the balanced development of grain, cotton, hemp, local specialties, and sideline production. After the meeting, the County Party Committee has sent investigation teams to go deep into the townships and cooperatives to investigate and summarize the farming systems in various places and the experience of developing a diversified economy, and to study and formulate specific planning methods with the masses.

    杭县的农副业总收入为什么逐年下降
    杨成
    浙江杭县历来是一个综合性的农业生产地区，群众有经营多种经济的习惯，农业副业产品有七十多种。以生产比较正常的1953年为例，全县全年农副业总收入四千三百八十多万元中，粮食产值占38.35％；工业原料占16.46％；油料作物占2.69％；土特产（包括茶叶、各种果类、瓜类、蔬菜、药材等）产值占28.89％；水产占4.93％；畜禽占6.07％；手工业品产值占2.61％。
    在杭县的农村生产中，工业原料和土特产占有极大比重，而粮食所占比重不大，这是同它的自然条件分不开的。
    杭县的自然条件具有哪些特点呢？
    第一，靠近大城市，发展多种经济可以适应城市工业原料和广大人民对副食品的需要，销路不成问题。
    第二，境内有山有水，河网密布，灌溉便利，土地肥沃。靠近钱塘江一带是沙地，适宜发展棉麻生产；运河两岸水网地带，鱼塘很多，适宜发展内河养鱼，种植果木；还有部分不高的黄土山，适宜种植茶树。
    第三，地少人多，粮食作物面积每人平均只有一亩一分多。因此，土地利用率向来很高，农民多乐意种植经济作物和土特产。
    但是，几年来，杭县粮食生产虽然逐年增加，农业副业总产值却逐年下降。
    全县农业副业总产值，1952年为四千五百多万元，1953年为四千三百八十多万元，1954年为三千五百九十多万元，1955年为四千三百七十多万元。其中除1954年因遭受大水灾不算外，1955年比1952年减少3％，较1953年减少0.23％；如果按1952年和1953年的不变价格计算，1955年的农业副业总产值则较1952年减少6.05％，较1953年减少4.85％。
    杭县的农业总产值为什么会逐年下降呢？
    省委、县委在领导生产方面存在着单一化的倾向，重视了列入国家计划的粮食、棉、麻、油料作物的生产，而忽视土特产和副业生产。这具体表现在三个方面：
    一、扩大水稻、棉、麻的面积，挤掉了甘蔗、荸荠、西瓜、生姜、药材等土特产作物的种植面积。拿1953年和1955年相比：1953年各种土特产（水果未包括在内）种植面积为十三万多亩，总产值为七百九十多万元；1955年土特产种植面积只有八万多亩，较1953年减少四万多亩，总产值为四百多万元，较1953年减少三百八十多万元。
    二、水果种植面积，虽然和水稻、棉、麻种植面积并无矛盾，但是因为忽视领导，放松培育，种植面积也逐年缩小，产量、质量有下降的趋势。1953年全县水果（包括枇杷、梅子、桃子、柿子）种植面积为二万四千多亩，单位产量为八百一十斤，总产量为十九万多担，总产值为一百四十多万元；1955年种植面积只有二万二千多亩，单位产量为六百八十斤，总产量降为十四万多担，总产值降为九十多万元，较1953年减少四十多万元。水果质量退化的情况也是十分严重的，像有名的“塘栖枇杷”，今年却变得酸而不甜，运到上海后销不出去，广大市民对“塘栖枇杷”大为失望，店家多将“塘栖”二字去掉。
    三、粮食统购统销以后饲料问题未能很好解决，猪肉价格低（收购价格和出售价格差率太高），加之合作社对社员肥料折价太低，农民养猪，养羊的积极性远不如以前，因此，全县猪、羊、鸡、鸭的数量直线下降。仍以1953年和1955年相比为例：1953年家畜、家禽数量为六十六万多头（只），总产量为八万多担，总产值为二百六十多万元；1955年家畜、家禽数量则只有四十多万头（只），总产量为五万多担，总产值降为二百十多万元，较1953年减少五十多万元。
    以上三方面的总产值，1955年比1953年共减少四百八十多万元，而1955年粮食、棉花、麻、茶、油菜、蚕等方面的总产值仅比1953年增加四百五十多万元，两者相抵，全县还要减少收入二十九万多元。
    土特产和农村副业总产值逐年下降的另一个重要原因，是县委在片面追求粮食高额产量的思想指导下，对于改变原有的耕作制度和生产习惯，采取了主观武断的态度，不作调查研究，分析利弊，就强迫群众执行。在1954年拔荸荠苗事件后，1956年春季改变耕作制度中（即将单季稻改双季稻），全县又拔掉一万多亩的春花作物。造成群众严重损失。三墩区有的群众反映：“1954年拔荸荠苗的眼泪还没有干，现在又要拔油菜、拔蚕豆了！”
    在上述错误思想指导下，杭县领导上为了限制土特产生产，还采用了许多错误的措施：
    其一，在政治上扣大帽子，说种荸荠、甘蔗、生姜等收入较多的土特产，就是发展资本主义，不服从国家计划，就要“种什么，吃什么！”
    其二，对种甘蔗、荸荠、西瓜的土地，不供应商品肥料，使这些生产无法维持下去。
    其三，压价增税，使种植土特产的农民无利可得。几年来，水稻、棉、麻的价格都有提高，而甘蔗、生姜、枇杷价格反而降低。1954年时，供销社竟以棉麻的产值、成本和纯收益，推算出甘蔗的价格，限价收购，使甘蔗的收益不得超过络麻；财粮部门还规定每户农民种植甘蔗在一分以上的，都要按累进税率缴纳附加的“甘蔗税”，全县当年有一万六千亩甘蔗，平均每亩征收甘蔗税九十斤稻谷。
    其四，在收购运销方面没有给以有力的支持。
    此外，省委领导方面的主观主义，对杭县情况缺乏系统的调查研究，在粮食问题上扣得过紧，拿对一般县的要求来要求一个向来靠外地供应食粮的县份，造成杭县粮食问题十分紧张的情况，这对于杭县县委在领导生产上所犯的主观主义错误，不能不看成是一个重要的因素。
            ×××
    今年6月间，在全县党员代表大会上，检查和批判了党在过去领导农业生产中所犯的主观主义、强迫命令错误，分析了杭县各种优越的自然条件，初步总结了过去良好的耕作制度，确认这些好的条件，在合作化的新情况下，可以得到进一步的发挥和运用，关键在于克服党的领导工作中的主观主义、官僚主义，加强系统的调查研究工作，从本地实际情况出发，根据杭县农业生产的特点，合理地安排各项生产，以保证粮、棉、麻、土特产和副业生产均衡的发展。会后，县委已派出调查组，深入乡、社，调查和总结各地的耕作制度和发展多种经济的经验，和群众研究制定具体规划的方法。
