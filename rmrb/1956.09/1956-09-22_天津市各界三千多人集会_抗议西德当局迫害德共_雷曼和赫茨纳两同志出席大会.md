Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 21st. Over 3,000 people from all circles in Tianjin held a meeting this morning at the Tianjin First Workers' Cultural Palace to protest the West German authorities' persecution of the German Communist Party. The First Secretary of the German Communist Party, Reimann, and member of the Central Committee of the German Communist Party, Herzner, who came to China to attend the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, were invited to come to Tianjin from Beijing to attend the meeting.

Gu Xiaobo, Chairman of the Tianjin Federation of Trade Unions and chairman of the meeting, said at the meeting: The West German authorities, at a time when international tensions are easing, have violated the will of the West German people and disregarded the opposition of world public opinion, and brazenly declared the German Communist Party illegal. We, the people of Tianjin, like the people of the whole country and the world, express our immense anger and strong protest against this atrocity by the West German authorities. We will strengthen our socialist construction and socialist transformation, and strengthen our practical actions to defend peace, in order to support the struggle of the German Communist Party and the German people.

Professor Zhang Guofan, Vice Chairman of the Tianjin Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for the Defense of World Peace, warned the West German authorities to learn from historical facts. He said that seventeen years ago, the Hitler fascists, under the guise of anti-communism, launched a war of aggression that led to their own destruction. Seventeen years later, militarists have even less chance of succeeding. Before the peace-loving people of the world, militarist adventures are doomed to failure.

Yang Xien, a well-known model worker in Tianjin and shift director of the steelmaking workshop of Tianjin Steel Plant, Wang Ren, representative of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, and Liu Jin, Vice Chairman of the Tianjin Democratic Women's Federation, also spoke at the meeting. They angrily protested against the West German authorities' persecution of the German Communist Party and expressed their active support for the just struggle of the German Communist Party and the German people.

Then, the audience stood up and welcomed the First Secretary of the German Communist Party, Reimann, to speak with thunderous and prolonged applause. Reimann said: "In the Federal Republic, the German Communist Party is fighting to maintain peace, for democracy and social progress, to eliminate militarism and to limit the power of the arms monopoly financial groups, and to fight for the peaceful reunification of Germany on a democratic basis. Therefore, the enemies of the working class and our people have outlawed our party. They want to deprive the people in the Federal Republic of the forces loyal to the people in the great national and social struggles. However, our party cannot be eradicated, it cannot be removed from the life of the working class and the people, because the party has firmly grown in the working class and the people."

Reimann continued: "In the Federal Republic, wherever there is a working class and people fighting for their social and national interests, for peace, freedom and progress, there are communists. In this struggle, the communists will be more firmly united with the working class than in the past, and will extend a brotherly hand to all progressive people, to all German patriots. There is no doubt that the German working class and German patriots will still be the victors in this struggle." When his speech ended, people raised their arms and shouted, "Protest against the West German authorities' persecution of the German Communist Party!" "Resolutely support the just struggle of the German Communist Party and the German people!" "Long live the German Communist Party!" "Long live the friendship between the Chinese and German people!"

Finally, all those present stood up and passed a resolution protesting against the West German authorities' persecution of the German Communist Party with stormy applause.

    天津市各界三千多人集会
    抗议西德当局迫害德共
    雷曼和赫茨纳两同志出席大会
    据新华社天津21日电　天津市三千多各界人士今天上午在天津市第一工人文化宫举行大会，抗议西德当局迫害德国共产党。到中国来参加中国共产党第八次全国代表大会的德国共产党第一书记雷曼和德国共产党中央委员赫茨纳，应邀由北京赶到天津出席大会。
    大会主席、天津市工会联合会主席谷小波在大会上说：西德当局在目前国际紧张局势日趋缓和情况下，违背西德人民的意志，不顾世界正义舆论的反对，悍然宣布德国共产党为非法。我们天津市人民像全国全世界人民一样对西德当局这种暴行，表示无比的愤怒和强烈的抗议。我们要以加强我们的社会主义建设和社会主义改造、加强保卫和平的实际行动，来支持德国共产党和德国人民的斗争。
    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会天津市分会副主席张国藩教授在大会上警告西德当局要从历史事实中取得教训。他说，十七年前希特勒法西斯打着反共的幌子，发动侵略战争的道路是自取灭亡的道路。十七年以后的今天，军国主义者是更没有侥幸的可能了。在全世界爱好和平的人民面前，军国主义的冒险必遭失败。
    天津市著名的劳动模范、天津钢厂炼钢车间值班主任杨锡恩、青年团天津市委员会代表王仁和天津市民主妇女联合会副主席刘金也在大会上相继讲话。他们愤怒地抗议西德当局对德国共产党的迫害，并对德国共产党和德国人民的正义斗争表示积极的支持。
    接着，全场起立以雷鸣般的长时间的鼓掌欢迎德国共产党第一书记雷曼讲话。雷曼说：德国共产党在联邦共和国为了保持和平为了民主和社会的进步，为了消除军国主义和限制军火垄断财阀的权力而斗争，在民主的基础上为和平统一德国而斗争，因此工人阶级的和我们人民的敌人就取缔了我们的党。他们想从联邦共和国内人民那里夺去在伟大的民族和社会斗争中的忠实于人民的力量。然而我们的党是不可能被根绝的，他是不可能从工人阶级和人民的生活中取消的，因为党已经牢固地生长在工人阶级和人民中间。
    雷曼接着说：在联邦共和国只要有工人阶级和人民为了他们的社会和民族的利益，为了和平、自由和进步而进行斗争的地方，那里就有共产党人。在这个斗争中共产党人将比过去更加牢固地同工人阶级团结在一起，并向全体进步人民，全体德国的爱国者伸出兄弟的手，毫无疑问，德国工人阶级、德国爱国者在这个斗争中也仍然是胜利者。当他的讲话结束时人们振臂高呼“抗议西德当局迫害德国共产党！”“坚决支持德国共产党和德国人民的正义斗争！”“德国共产党万岁！”“中德人民的友谊万岁！”
    最后全体到会的人起立，以暴风雨般的掌声通过了抗议西德当局迫害德国共产党的决议。
