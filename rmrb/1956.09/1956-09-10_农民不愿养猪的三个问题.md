    Three Problems with Farmers' Unwillingness to Raise Pigs

    The countryside is now in the busy farming season, with people working hard all day long without rest. Under these circumstances, they should be eating better. However, in rural areas such as Chaoxian County, Anhui, apart from the four liang of sesame oil supplied to each person per month, they cannot even get a bit of pork or lard. Occasionally, a pig or two is slaughtered in a month or so and sold in the towns, and people have to fight to buy it. What is the reason for so few pigs?

    ① The pig tax is slightly heavy or the regulations are unreasonable. Here, regardless of the size or weight of the pig, a tax of 6.5 yuan (equivalent to 13 jin of pork) is levied for each pig slaughtered. In Jinjigang Village, a farmer (member) named Yuan raised a pig and slaughtered it at 55 jin. The pig tax took away 13 jin, and the handling fee took away another 3 jin (plus two packs of cigarettes). He actually only got 39 jin of meat himself. After calculating the cost, it was not worth the cost of feed. In this way, the enthusiasm for raising pigs will naturally not be great.

    ② Those who raise pigs themselves cannot eat pork. In Jinjigang Village, many farming households (several households jointly raise a pig) slaughtered four pigs, but the pig-raising families only got one or two jin of meat. The rest must be given to other families (at a price). This also reduces their enthusiasm for raising pigs.

    ③ Feed is both scarce and expensive. The main feed for pigs here is bran, which costs five jiao per ten jin. It is hard to say whether ten jin of bran can grow one jin of meat. If these problems are not resolved, there will be fewer and fewer pigs. Jiang Bu

    农民不愿养猪的三个问题
    农村现在正处在农忙的季节，整日劳动毫不消闲，在这种情况下，理应吃得比较好一些。可是，安徽巢县等地的农村里，除掉供应每人每月四两香油以外，连一点猪肉猪油也吃不到。偶尔在个把月的时间里杀个把猪，在市镇上卖一下，买的人都要抢得打架。猪这么少原因在哪里呢？
    ①猪税略重或规定得不合理。这里规定不管猪大小轻重，杀一头交税六元五角（合十三斤猪肉）。在金鸡港村有一个姓袁的农民（社员），养一头猪，杀了五十五斤，猪税就去掉十三斤，手续费又去掉三斤（另外还有两包香烟）本人实际只得三十九斤肉，一算账还不值饲料钱。这样一来，养猪的兴头当然就不会大了。
    ②自己养猪自己吃不到猪肉。金鸡港村好多户农民（几户合伙养一头猪）杀了四口猪，养猪的人家只吃到一、二斤肉，其余的一定要匀给别人家（按价给钱），这样也减低了他们养猪的积极性。
    ③饲料既缺又贵。这里猪的主要饲料是糠，每十斤价值五角钱。十斤糠是不是能长一斤肉那还很难说。这些问题不解决，猪就会越来越少了。　江布
