Living Under the New Economic System
Ke Lin

In Hanjiawa Township, Ding County, Hebei Province, many farmers have couplets pasted on their doors like this: "Cooperative production brings everyone energy; Grain output increases year after year." The horizontal inscription is "The cooperative is home" or "A happy future." These are not empty auspicious words like ordinary couplets, but a true description of the current production and living conditions of the people.

The Hanjiawa Township Agricultural Cooperative is an advanced cooperative of 1,135 households established last autumn. Except for a few people living far from the village, everyone in the township has joined the cooperative. There is not much land here, with an average of just over 2.2 mu per person. However, because there is more irrigated land and the soil is good, it is still a relatively wealthy village in Ding County. The situation of this cooperative can represent the few advanced cooperatives in Ding County.

Taking corn, sweet potatoes, and wheat, the staple foods of the people here, the yield has indeed been increasing year by year. After the advanced cooperativization, the output increased even faster. The average yield of corn last year was 240 jin per mu, and this year it can reach 350 jin. The average yield of sweet potatoes last year was 3,000 jin per mu, and this year it can reach 4,500 jin. Some high-yield plots amazed even the old farmers. More than 120 mu of Baima Tooth corn can yield more than 1,000 jin per mu; more than 80 mu of sweet potatoes can yield more than 10,000 jin per mu (when I left, the overflowing river had already flooded more than 400 mu of the cooperative’s land. The autumn grain that was about to be harvested may be reduced). Although the wheat suffered serious losses due to rain during the harvest season, the general yield per mu was still about 20 jin more than last year's bumper wheat harvest.

When I specifically understood how these figures were obtained, I deeply realized how much hard work and struggle each figure contained!

Take technical reform work as an example. When the elementary cooperative was established, reforms in farming techniques were also carried out. However, the conditions at that time could not be compared with the superior conditions of such a large-scale and unified action after advanced cooperativization. After the establishment of the Hanjiawa Advanced Cooperative, the cooperative established a technical organization system including more than 140 people. Each production team has a technical group, and various technical measures for each season are quickly turned into mass action on thousands of acres through this powerful technical organization system. Just take this one thing. The cooperative's technical committee decided to implement artificial pollination of corn. After technical training, pollination activities immediately unfolded in thousands of acres of corn fields. When the pollination tools were not enough, the women used their creativity and pasted several layers of old newspapers to make a batch of pollination tools. Under such unified planning and organized action, artificial pollination was generally carried out on more than 3,000 mu of corn, and some were even pollinated three times. According to reliable experimental statistics, pollination alone can increase corn production by more than 60,000 jin.

Of course, the reform of cultivation techniques was not always so smooth.

Hanjiawa Township has to plant thousands of mu of sweet potatoes every year, and a large number of seedlings have to be cultivated in the spring. Due to the influence of sweet potato black spot disease and other diseases, rot often occurs to varying degrees every year. Some are completely rotten after only one crop of seedlings is pulled. In order to prevent this disease, the technical committee decided that all sweet potato seeds should be soaked in warm water this year. At that time, many farmers could not accept it, and several old farmers resisted the most. When soaking the seeds, these old farmers who were not thinking straight shouted, "It's broken! Just wait to eat cooked sweet potatoes!" They secretly ran to the seedling bed at night to see if they were really cooked. After a few days, tender buds sprouted in clusters, and the seedlings grew "fat-headed and big-eared." One crop after another was pulled, and there was little rot. At this time, the worries of the people "fell into their stomachs." Hanjiawa's sweet potato seedlings became famous, and An Guo and other counties also came from afar to buy them. In addition to their own planting, the sweet potato seedlings were sold for more than 20,000 yuan, which was distributed to the members, and each family received nearly 20 yuan. The members said excitedly: "I didn't expect a small technique to top such a big thing!"

The members have never been so interested in technical reforms as this year. It is true that sometimes a seemingly simple technical measure can make crops grow thousands or tens of thousands of jin more grain. After advanced cooperativization, the farmers in Hanjiawa have fully utilized the superiority of the cooperative in this regard. Various crops have undergone technical reforms in almost every process from planting to harvesting.

In the production upsurge after advanced cooperativization, the most impressive thing for the members was the hot and bustling movement of accumulating and delivering fertilizer in winter. People talk about the lively scene at that time and said: It's a pity you didn't come to see it at that time. Thousands upon thousands of male and female laborers transported thousands upon thousands of carts of fertilizer to the fields in the fertilizer accumulation movement of "turning sludge over and replacing old kang with new ones." At night, lanterns and torches lined up into a brilliant rainbow. The members described the scene at that time: "Looking from a distance, it looks like a big railway station." If there were not enough livestock, people were used to pull carts. In order to complete the fertilizer accumulation and delivery plan on time, the members experienced several sleepless nights. Looking at it now, some actions were not appropriate enough. Some of the fertilizers made in large-scale campaigns were of very poor quality, and there was also some waste of labor and animal power. However, despite these shortcomings, people still talked about those boiling days with interest.

Fertilizer is the "food" of crops; according to the members: some land can be "fed" this year! In the past, wheat was rarely top-dressed here. This year, more than 5,000 mu of wheat was generally top-dressed. Last year, an average of about seven carts of fertilizer were used per mu, and this year it averaged 13 carts. In the past, corn used an average of five carts of fertilizer per mu, and this year the average fertilization was 14 carts, more than doubled. The cooperative used various methods to reward pig raising, and the increase in pen manure was even greater. Now, every household in the cooperative has a pen, and every pen has pigs. Now each household has an average of one and a half pigs, and by the end of the year, it can be increased to two pigs per household. A cooperative cadre said: "To tell a joke, a large part of our increased grain production is pulled (shit) out by pigs!"

★

When I arrived at the village, most of the autumn crops were still growing in the fields, and only the early corn had been harvested. Therefore, I can only understand the partial situation of the summer harvest distribution and the ongoing corn distribution. Although this is not the final summary for the whole year, it can generally show the general situation of the cooperative's production and the lives of the members.

This cooperative's summer wheat production increased by more than 300,000 jin compared to last year. The summer harvest distribution accounted for 33.9% of the total income for various deductions, and the rest was distributed to the members. 96% of the members in the cooperative received more wheat than last year. The following are the distribution figures of wheat and corn that can represent several different farm households in the cooperative: Name Composition Population Labor Wheat Corn
Yu Shenghua Poor peasant 6 Two and a half Last year This year Last year This year
Wang Laojie Poor peasant 4 Less than one 407 782 557 1083
Wang Laocui New middle peasant 4 Two 440 328 640 420
Wang Laoshuang New upper middle peasant 15 Two and a half 273 477 355 569
Wang Laomi Old middle peasant 6 Two 872 1011 1638 1478
Wang Laoming Old upper middle peasant 10 Two and a half 515 770 675 1055
840 880

Remarks: ① Wang Laoming is a new member who joined the cooperative last autumn, and the rest are old members.
② The unit of grain calculation is jin.

From the above simple figures, combined with family visits and conversations with cooperative cadres, I learned about the following aspects and problems:

In the first year after the advanced cooperativization of this cooperative, the production level increased rapidly, and the income of the vast majority of members increased during the summer distribution. In particular, households with more labor force have seen a more significant increase in income. For example, the poor peasant Yu Shenghua in the table above, both wheat and corn have nearly doubled compared to last year. When I went to her house, she told me about her past suffering and the gradual increase in her situation after the land reform. This middle-aged peasant woman is now the captain of the eighth production team. The more she spoke, the more excited she became, and she took my hand and said with a smile: "The advanced cooperative is really a hundred times better for households like us! In terms of family property, we are still not good; in terms of grain, we are rich enough." There are quite a few households in this cooperative like Yu Shenghua whose income has increased significantly, and some have even increased two or three times. In the fourth farming station, there is an old man named An Laogang. His family has nine people and seven male and female laborers. This year, he has a net distribution of more than 2,500 jin of wheat and more than 3,000 jin of corn. After the wheat distribution, he spent more than 160 yuan to buy a brand new "Liberation" brand bicycle. After the autumn harvest, he will be distributed more grain. People say that this family is now the "head of the cooperative." After a member introduced his situation to me, he said with emotion and excitement: "Now the world is exactly the opposite! In the past, whoever had more land was the head household, and now whoever has more labor force is the head household!"

There are also people here who are not in high spirits. They are the wealthy middle peasants who have just joined the cooperative. Although the production level of the cooperative has increased a lot, and it is almost the same as the level of the upper-middle peasants when they worked independently, they always feel that after joining the cooperative, their production and life are not as good as before, not free, and not happy. According to the cooperative cadres, in the past, the elementary cooperative, the first year of the old middle peasants joining the cooperative, generally could not catch up with their income when they were working independently. For example, the old middle peasant Wang Laomi, in the first year of joining the cooperative in 1953, earned more than 200 jin less wheat than when he was working independently. And Wang Laoming, the old upper-middle peasant who produced the best in the village, almost caught up with him in the first year he joined the advanced cooperative. This year, he has a net distribution of 880 jin of wheat; last year, when he was working independently, he harvested more than 1,660 jin of wheat, deducting public grain and production costs, and had a net surplus of more than 840 jin. The distribution this year is almost the same as his income when he was working independently last year. A member said: If Lao Ming hadn't been "emotional," he would have distributed more grain, and his family's labor is very strong!

I really wanted to know what kind of "emotions" Wang Laoming had. On a rainy dusk, I went to his house. After some polite words, Lao Ming's "emotions" slowly revealed themselves.

"Did you join the advanced cooperative voluntarily?"

"Voluntary! There is no coercion here, it's all voluntary."

"Joining the cooperative is good, right?"

"Good! Very good! There is nothing bad about the road pointed out by Chairman Mao! It saves a lot of trouble! We will do whatever is pointed out to us, without having to worry about it ourselves..."

The tone contained sarcasm. Then, Lao Ming talked about how he "voluntarily" joined the cooperative: "The cadres said at the meeting that it is up to you to decide whether to join the cooperative or not; but the tractor will come next year, and the large machine cannot go around the corners and detours, and whoever's land blocks the machine farming will have to be replaced. ...If you are to be pushed aside when people are machine farming, planting that bad land, it is better to join; sooner or later you have to join..." In this way, the old man gritted his teeth, sold the big mule, exchanged it for an old donkey, and joined the cooperative. People say that after he joined the cooperative, he often frowned and did not work hard in the field, and only went to the "private plot" to tend the vegetables.

According to our understanding, households like Lao Ming account for nearly one-tenth of the total households in this village. They all have similar emotions to Lao Ming. These households are almost all so-called "four strong" households with strong people, strong horses, complete farm tools, and fertile land. They joined the cooperative in the upsurge, and the production of the cooperative has not surpassed them for a while. They are very nostalgic for their past days. "However, these people are all good laborers. As long as the production of the cooperative continues to increase, they will not get less in the cooperative, and they will get used to it in one or two years," a cooperative cadre said confidently.

There are also other people who have not increased their income much or even reduced their income. They are households with little labor or weak labor. For example, the poor peasant Wang Laojie, a family of four, only he can work. This old farmer, who was tortured into a "hunchback" by the heavy labor of the old society, actually does not top a full labor force. When the elementary cooperative was established, he relied on his own labor and the dividends of twelve mu of land, and his life was still okay. After the advanced cooperative abolished the land dividends, the burden of the family's life was placed on his own labor income, and his income decreased. For households like this, their lives have been rising from the land reform to the establishment of the elementary cooperative. After switching to the advanced cooperative, their lives have not been improved. I once asked Lao Jie: "The advanced cooperative is not very good for households like you, right?" He quickly said: "Comrade! You can't say that. The method is a good method, just blame our own labor is not good. ..." This old farmer, like other poor farmers who have suffered from the old society, followed the Party to turn over, and has infinite trust in the leadership of the Party; in the new changes in production relations, he encountered new difficulties, but he did not complain. His conversation was touching, and his living conditions made people feel deeply uneasy.

I once studied the problems of such households with the cooperative cadres. They said: There are about 10% of households like Wang Laojie in the cooperative, and some households' income is not lower than in the past, but their lives are not very good. Even a strong laborer, dragging a large group of children, is living tightly. Anyway, no matter how good the system is, it is not good without labor.

This is indeed a realistic problem. These households are not guaranteed by the "five guarantees," and relief is not yet available. In today's abolition of land dividends and labor becoming the only source of livelihood, how to ensure that their lives can also be improved is worthy of attention.

From the perspective of the whole village, the rise in farmers' lives is universal. "Stronger year by year, and even stronger this year," this is almost the unanimous saying of the members. An old member said: "To see if life is improving, first look at clothing and food." Almost all the young girls and daughters-in-law in this village are wearing brightly colored cloth shirts; I also saw two simple lads wearing shirts with flowers like the girls. A cooperative cadre told me: The change in the members' dress is only in the last year or two; in the past, it was big patches and small patches, now it is "Hawaii" and "Peace Shirts," and many female members have new "uniforms" (referring to cadre uniforms, the women here still regard wearing cadre uniforms as the most fashionable dress). After the wheat distribution, the supply and marketing cooperative's mobile team brought calico to the eighth farming station, and sold 72 yuan in a short time. The food is generally much better than in the past. After the wheat harvest, the cooperative exchanged 20,000 jin of rice, which was quickly distributed to the members. In previous years, it was not easy to eat a meal of rice during the holidays, but now eating "gold and silver rice" (rice and millet mixed rice) is not uncommon.

Of course, looking at their entire lives, the traces of poverty are still very obvious. Living conditions have rarely improved. Although there are a few families with new houses with large glass windows, it is not common; in many homes, the pot stove and kang are connected together, making the whole family black; the sanitary conditions of many families are still very bad.... The cooperative cadres said: "We can't take care of these now, come and see in a few years!" The cooperative also made a long-term plan for the improvement of living conditions. I hope to see greater changes in the lives of the people when I go again.

    生活在新的经济制度下
    克林
    在河北省定县韩家洼乡，不少农家的门上都贴着这样对联：“合作生产人人带劲；粮食产量年年增加。”横额是“社就是家”，或是“幸福远景”。这并不是像一般对联那样的空洞的吉庆话，而是现在人民生产和生活状况的真实描述。
    韩家洼乡农业社是去年秋季建成的一千一百三十五户的高级社，全乡除下几户住得离村庄较远的人以外，全都入了社。这里土地不多，每人平均只有二亩二分多地。但是因为水地较多，土质也好，在定县还是比较富的村庄。这个社的情况，可以代表定县为数很少的先进社。
    拿这里人民生活的主要食粮玉米、甘薯、小麦来说，产量的确是年年增加。高级合作化以后，产量提高得更快。玉米去年每亩平均产量二百四十斤，今年可以达到三百五十斤。甘薯去年每亩平均产量三千斤，今年可达到四千五百斤。部分高额丰产地使老农也感到惊讶。有一百二十多亩白马牙玉米每亩产量可以达到千斤以上；有八十多亩甘薯，每亩产量可达万斤以上（当我离开的时候，泛滥的河水已经淹没了社里四百多亩地。即将到手的秋粮，可能要减产了）。小麦虽然在收获时期遇雨，受到严重损失，一般每亩仍比去年丰收的小麦增产二十斤左右。
    当我具体地了解这些数字是怎样得来的时候，我深切地体会到，每一项数字里，包含着多少辛勤的劳动和斗争！
    就拿技术改革工作来说吧。办初级社的时候也进行过耕作技术的改革，但是，那时候的条件和高级合作化以后这样规模巨大、行动统一的优越条件是不能相比的。韩家洼高级社建成后，社里就成立了包括有一百四十多人的技术组织系统。生产队都设有技术小组，每个季节的各种技术措施，经过这个强大有力的技术组织系统，很快就在几千亩的大面积上变成群众的行动。单说这一件事吧。社里技术委员会决定实行玉米人工授粉，经过技术传授，授粉活动立即在千百亩玉米田里展开。授粉器不够用了，妇女们就发挥创造性，把旧报纸糊上几层，做了一批授粉器。在这样统一计划和有组织的行动下，三千多亩玉米普遍实行了人工授粉，部分还授了三次。据可靠的试验统计，仅授粉一项，就可以增产玉米六万斤以上。
    当然，耕作技术的改革也并不都是那样顺利的。
    韩家洼乡每年都要种几千亩甘薯，春季要大量育苗。因为甘薯黑斑病和其他病害的影响，年年总要发生轻重不同的烂床现象。有的只拔一茬秧就全烂了。为了防止这种病害，技术委员会决定今年全部甘薯种都要温汤浸过，当时很多农民不能接受，有几个老农抵抗的最厉害。浸种的时候，这些思想不通的老农嚷着“坏啦！等着吃熟甘薯吧！”他们晚上悄悄跑到育苗床边去偷看，是不是真的煮熟了。没过几天，嫩芽一丛一丛地钻出来了，秧子长得“肥头大耳”的，拔了一茬又一茬，很少烂坏的。这时候，耽心的人“心才算跌到肚里了”。韩家洼的甘薯秧出了名，安国等县也老远来买，甘薯秧子除自种以外前后共卖了二万多元，都分给了社员，一家差不多分到二十多元。社员们兴奋地说：“想不到一件小技术，顶了这样大的事！”
    社员们再没有像今年这样对技术改革感到兴趣了。确实是这样，有时看去很简单的一项技术措施，就能使庄稼多生长出几千几万斤粮食来。高级合作化以后的韩家洼农民，在这一方面充分利用了合作社的优越性。各种作物从种下去到收回来，几乎每个过程都进行了技术改革。
    在高级合作化以后的生产高潮里，社员们印象最深的是冬季开展的热火朝天的积肥送肥运动。人们谈起当时的热闹情景说：可惜那时你没来看看。成千成百的男女劳力，在“污泥翻身，旧炕换新”的积肥运动里，把成千上万车肥料运送到田野里去。入夜，灯笼火把排成一条灿烂的长虹，社员们这样形容当时的景象：“远远看去，就像个大火车站。”牲口不够就用人来拉车。为了按时完成积肥送肥计划，社员们经历过好几个不眠之夜。现在来看，有些行动是不够恰当的，大量突击造下的肥料，有些质量是很差的，劳力畜力也有若干浪费。但是，尽管有这些缺点，人们谈起那些沸腾的日子，仍然充满着兴趣。
    肥料是庄稼的“食粮”；按社员们的说法：有些地今年可“吃饱”了！小麦这里过去很少追肥，今年五千多亩小麦普遍进行了追肥，去年平均每亩约七车肥，今年平均达到十三车。玉米过去每亩平均用肥五车，今年平均施肥十四车，增加了一倍多。社里用各种办法奖励养猪，圈肥增加的更多，全社家家有圈，圈圈有猪。现在每户已经平均有一头半猪，到年底就可以增加到每户两头猪了。一个社干部说：“说句笑话，我们增产的粮食有很大一部分是猪拉（拉屎）出来的呢！”
                ★
    我到村的时候，秋庄稼大部分还长在地里，只有早玉米收摘完毕。因此，只能了解夏收分配和正在进行的玉米分配的部分情况。这虽然还不是全年最后的总结，但大体也可以看出合作社的生产和社员生活的一般情况。
    这个社夏季小麦比去年增产三十多万斤。夏收分配中各项扣除共占总收入的33.9％，其余全部分给社员，全社96％的社员分的小麦都比去年收入多。以下是能代表全社几种不同农户的小麦和玉米的分配数字：姓名　成份　人口　劳动力             小麦　玉米余生华　贫　农　6　二个半        去年　今年　去年　今年王老皆　贫　农　4　不足一个      407　782　557　1083 王老翠　新中农　4　二　个        440　328　640　420王老双　新上中农　15　二个半     273　477　355　569王老米　老中农　6　二　个        872　1011　1638　1478王老名　老上中农　10　二个半     515　770　675　1055
                                 840　880   
    备注：①王老名是去年秋季入社的新社员，其余都是老社员。
      ②粮食计算单位是斤。
    从以上的简单数字，结合家庭访问和社干部的谈话，我了解到以下几方面的情况和问题：
    这个社高级合作化后的第一年，生产水平提高得很快，绝大多数社员夏季分配都增加了收入。特别是劳力多的户，收入增加得更为显著。如上表中的贫农余生华，小麦玉米都比去年增加近一倍。我到她家去的时候，她向我叙述了她过去的苦难经历和土地改革后逐年上升的情况。这个中年农妇，现在是第八生产队的队长。她越说越兴奋，拉起我的手笑着说：“高级社对我们这样户真是一百个好！要说家底，咱还不行；要说粮食，就够富裕了。”这个社里像余生华这样收入显著增加的户很不少，有的甚至增加两三倍。第四耕作站有个安老岗，全家九口人，有七个男女劳动力，今年净分小麦二千五百多斤、玉米三千斤以上。小麦分配以后，他花一百六十多元买了个崭新的“解放”牌自行车。秋收完毕，他将会分到更多的粮食。人们都说这家现在是“全社头一户”。一个社员向我介绍了他的情况后，又感慨又兴奋地说：“现在世界正好反了个过！过去是谁地多谁是头户，现在是谁劳动力多谁就是头户！”
    这里也有情绪不高的人，他们是新入社的富裕中农。合作社的生产水平虽然提高了很多，同上中农单干时候的水平已经相差不多了，他们却总觉得入社以后生产生活都不如过去，不自由，不痛快。据社干部说，过去的初级社，老中农入社第一年，一般赶不上他自己单干的收入。如老中农王老米，1953年第一年入社，光小麦就比单干时少收入二百多斤。而全村生产最好的老上中农王老名，加入高级社的第一年，社的生产差不多就赶上了他。今年他净分小麦八百八十斤；去年他单干时收获小麦一千六百六十多斤，扣除公粮和生产费用等，净余八百四十多斤。今年分的和他去年单干时候的收入差不多。一个社员这样说：老名要不是“闹情绪”，分的粮食还会更多些，他家的劳动可强哩！
    我很想了解王老名有些什么“情绪”。在一个阴雨的黄昏，我到他家去。一番客套话之后，老名的“情绪”慢慢显露了出来。
    “你是自己愿意加入高级社的吗？”
    “自愿！我们这儿就没有强迫的，都是自愿。”
    “入社很好吧？”
    “好！很好！毛主席指的道路还有个不好！多省心！指到哪里咱就干到哪里，不用自己张罗……”
    语气中含着嘲讽。接着，老名谈起他是怎样“自愿”入社的：“干部们开会说，入社不入社听随自便；可是明年就来了拖拉机，大机器可不能转弯抹角绕道走，谁的地挡着机耕都得换。……要叫人家机耕的时候给撩到一边去，种那歹地，还不如入进去；早晚总得入……。”就这样，这老汉才把心一横，把大骡子一卖，换了条老驴，入了社。人们说他入社后经常锁着眉头，下地不大带劲，光去“自留地”里侍弄菜。
    据了解，像老名这样的户，约占这村总农户将近十分之一的样子。他们都有类似老名的情绪。这些户差不多都是人强、马壮、农具齐、土地肥的所谓“四强”户，他们在高潮里入了社，社的生产一时还超不过他们，他们对自己过去的日子，十分留恋。“不过，这些人都是好劳动，只要社的生产不断提高，他们在社里分的也少不了，不要一二年就过惯了。”一个社干部很有自信地这样说。
    这里还有另一种增加收入不多甚至减少了收入的人，他们是劳力少、劳力弱的户。如贫农王老皆，一家四口，就他自己能劳动。这个被旧社会沉重的劳动折磨成了“罗锅腰”的老农，实际上顶不了一个全劳动力。在办初级社的时候，他依靠自己劳动和十二亩地的分红，生活还可以。高级社取消土地分红以后，全家生活的重担，都放在他一个人的劳动收入上，他的收入减少了。像这样的户，从土地改革到办初级社，他们的生活是一直上升的。转入高级社以后，他们的生活却不能有所改善。我曾经问老皆：“高级社对你这样户不大好吧？”他连忙说：“同志！可不能这样说。办法是好办法，就怨咱自己劳动不行。……”这个老农和其他受尽旧社会折磨的贫农一样，他跟随党翻了身，对党的领导有无限的信赖；在生产关系的新变化中，他遇到了新的困难，但并无怨言。他的谈话使人感动，他的生活状况又使人深感不安。
    我曾经和社干部研究这类户的问题。他们说：像王老皆这样户社里约有10％左右，有些户的收入虽然并不低于过去，日子也不大好过。就是一个壮劳力，拖上一大群孩子，生活也是够紧的。反正制度再好，没劳力总是不行。
    这的确是个现实的问题。这些户“五保”保不着他们，救济也还谈不到，在取消土地分红、劳动成为唯一生活来源的今天，怎样使他们的生活也能得到一些改善，是值得注意的。
    从全村看，农民生活的上升是普遍的。“一年比一年强，今年更强”，这差不多是社员们一致的说法。一个老社员说：“生活改善不改善，先看穿衣和吃饭。”这村年轻的姑娘媳妇们，差不多都穿着花色鲜艳的布衬衣；我还看见有两个楞小子也和姑娘们一样穿着有花朵的衬衫。一个社干部告诉我：社员穿戴上的改变，只是近一二年的事；过去是大补钉、小补钉，现在是“夏威夷”、“和平衫”，很多女社员都有了新“制服”（指干部服，这里的妇女仍然把穿干部服作为最时新的装束）。小麦分配以后，供销社的流动小组带着花布到第八耕作站，一会儿就卖了七十二元。吃的一般也比过去强多了。麦收以后，社里换来两万斤大米，很快就被社员分光了。往年过节也不容易吃顿大米，现在吃“金银饭”（大米、小米混合做的饭）不算稀罕。
    当然，从他们的整个生活看，贫困的痕迹还是很明显的。居住条件还很少改善，盖大玻璃窗新房子的虽有几家，但并不普遍；许多家锅灶和炕连在一起，熏得全家乌黑；许多家庭卫生情况还很不好……。社干部说：“现在还顾不上这些哩，过几年你再来看看吧！”居住条件的改善，社里也作了远景规划。我希望再去的时候能看到人民生活更大的改变。
