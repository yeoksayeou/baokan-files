    On the northeast sea off Xiamen Island, there is a small island called Jiaoyu, which is only two kilometers away from Kinmen Island, occupied by Chiang Kai-shek's troops. On calm nights, one can hear the voices of Chiang Kai-shek's officers and soldiers speaking on the front lines of Kinmen Island. It is on this small island that the radio loudspeakers set up by the Chinese People's Liberation Army broadcast day and night to the Chiang Kai-shek officers and soldiers on Kinmen Island, broadcasting the brilliant achievements of the motherland's socialist construction, explaining the policies of the People's Government, exposing the truth about American imperialism's occupation of our territory of Taiwan, and broadcasting family letters from Chiang Kai-shek's family members to their husbands and sons in the Chiang Kai-shek army. During festivals, the announcers also specially introduced to the Chiang Kai-shek officers and soldiers the grand celebrations in mainland cities and the dragon boat races in the southern countryside.
    Since the radio loudspeakers began broadcasting to the Chiang Kai-shek troops on Kinmen Island in March 1953, for more than three years, the announcers have overcome the difficulties of interference and shelling by the Chiang Kai-shek troops, and the call of the motherland and the words of loved ones that they have insisted on broadcasting have lingered in the hearts of the Chiang Kai-shek officers and soldiers day and night, pointing out the path they should take.
    One night, not long after the radio loudspeakers began broadcasting, a reconnaissance team from the Chiang Kai-shek army on Kinmen Island sent a rubber boat to scout the terrain near Jiaoyu Island. At this time, the radio loudspeakers on Jiaoyu Island broadcast to the Chiang Kai-shek troops on Kinmen Island about the preferential treatment given by our army to Wang Weihua, the captured Chiang Kai-shek army captain instructor in the Dongshan Island battle, leaving a deep impression on the Chiang Kai-shek soldiers in the rubber boat. The next night, the Chiang Kai-shek reconnaissance team sent two sappers, Zhou Yajin and Mo Xingpeng, to Jiaoyu to scout, and after they climbed onto Jiaoyu Island, they surrendered to the People's Liberation Army.
    A year later, Zhong Wenlu, a sergeant squad leader, Xia Kangli, a corporal deputy squad leader, and Li Changshi, a signalman, from the Chiang Kai-shek army on Kinmen Island, swam together to surrender to the People's Liberation Army. They said that after listening to the Jiaoyu broadcasts every day, they were able to recite the five guarantees of the People's Liberation Army to the Chiang Kai-shek army personnel. On the night they swam to surrender, it was very dark, and they lost their way while fighting the waves. Just as they were worried about falling back into the hands of the Chiang Kai-shek army, they suddenly heard the sound of the radio loudspeakers on Jiaoyu Island again, and they swam vigorously towards the direction of the sound.
      In order to enable the Chiang Kai-shek officers and soldiers to hear the sound of the motherland's advance in a timely and uninterrupted manner, in addition to broadcasting major political activities and economic construction news of the motherland in a timely manner, the announcers also frequently broadcast the motherland's cultural construction, sports competitions, and new songs created by musicians. Every Saturday and during festivals, they organized a "radio evening" for the Chiang Kai-shek troops on Kinmen Island. In order to make the content of the evening rich and varied, the announcers often took tape recorders to distant places to record operas, folk songs, and hometown operas of the Chiang Kai-shek officers and soldiers. Sometimes, some mothers, wives, brothers, or children of Chiang Kai-shek officers and soldiers came from other places and asked to talk to their fathers, brothers, sons, and husbands in the Chiang Kai-shek army on the radio loudspeakers. The announcers received them with lofty humanitarian spirit every time. These family members of the Chiang Kai-shek soldiers told their family members in the Chiang Kai-shek army about everything at home from the radio loudspeakers, telling them how many pounds of flour they bought for the festival, how many pounds of meat they weighed, which child they bought cloth for to make new clothes, which child entered school, how their academic performance was, and how much the People's Government loaned their family, how many farm tools and fishing gear they added, and how much the family's income increased this year or this season, and so on. Once, the daughter of a Chiang Kai-shek army personnel living on Xiaodeng Island asked her father and brother in the Chiang Kai-shek army sadly in the radio loudspeakers: "During the New Year and festivals, families are together, happily, but why don't you father and brother come back?" When she asked this, she couldn't help but cry sadly. At this time, the announcers immediately comforted her and said, "If your father and brother think of you, they will come back."
    Since July of this year, the announcers have repeatedly broadcast the recording of Premier Zhou Enlai's speech on the peaceful liberation of Taiwan. From this time on, the Chiang Kai-shek army's front-line positions on Kinmen Island set up sentry guns specifically to bombard this radio loudspeaker. Many shells fell on the fortress where the radio loudspeaker was placed, the fortress was destroyed, and the announcers changed the broadcasting time from day to night. They carried heavy loudspeakers, frequently changed the broadcasting location, and stubbornly and continuously continued to broadcast to the Chiang Kai-shek officers and soldiers. The loud sound from this radio loudspeaker eliminated the barriers of the sea and artificial obstacles every night, like a magnet, attracting the hearts of the Chiang Kai-shek officers and soldiers on Kinmen Island back to the embrace of the motherland's mainland and their warm hometowns.

    响彻金门岛上空的祖国之声
    新华社记者　周长宗
    在厦门岛东北的海面上，有一个名叫角屿的小岛，它距离蒋军盘据的金门岛只有二公里，在风平浪静的夜里，在这里可以听到金门岛前沿阵地上蒋军官兵说话的声音。就在这个小岛上，中国人民解放军安设的广播喇叭，日夜不停地向金门岛上蒋军官兵播送着祖国社会主义建设的光辉成就，解说着人民政府的政策，揭露着美帝国主义侵占我国领土台湾的真相，和代播蒋军家属给在蒋军中的丈夫、儿子的家信。逢到节日，广播员们还特地向蒋军官兵介绍大陆城市欢度节日的盛况和南方农村的赛龙舟大会。
    从1953年3月广播喇叭开始向金门岛蒋军播音起，三年多来，广播员们克服了蒋军的干扰和炮击的困难，坚持播出的祖国的号召和亲人的话语，日日夜夜地萦绕着蒋军官兵的心头，为蒋军官兵指引出应走的道路。
    在广播喇叭开始播音不久的一天夜里，金门岛蒋军侦察队开出一只橡皮船，驶近角屿岛侦察地形。这时，角屿岛上的广播喇叭向金门岛蒋军广播东山岛战斗中被俘的蒋军上尉指导员王维华受到我军优待的情形，给橡皮船上的蒋军士兵留下了深刻的印象。第二天夜里，蒋军侦察队派出工兵周亚金、莫兴鹏二人到角屿摸哨，当他们爬上角屿岛后，就向人民解放军投诚了。
    相隔一年以后，金门岛上蒋军中士班长锺文录、下士副班长夏康礼和通信兵李尝时又一起泅水向人民解放军投诚了。他们说：天天听角屿的广播，他们都能够把人民解放军对蒋军人员的五项保证背诵出来。在他们泅水投诚的这天夜晚，天很黑，他们在与海涛搏斗时，迷失了方向，正当他们担心再落入蒋军手里时，忽然又听到了角屿岛上广播喇叭的声音，他们就朝着广播喇叭发出响声的方向奋力游了过来。
      为了使蒋军官兵及时地、不间断地听到祖国前进的脚步声，广播员们除了及时广播祖国的重大政治活动和经济建设消息外，还经常广播祖国的文化建设、体育比赛以及音乐家创作的新歌曲。他们每星期六和逢年过节时，都为金门岛蒋军组织一次“广播晚会”。为了使晚会的内容丰富多采，广播员们往往不辞艰辛的带着录音机到很远的地方去录戏曲、民歌以及蒋军官兵的家乡戏。有时候，有些蒋军官兵的母亲、妻子、兄弟或儿女从外地赶来，要求在广播喇叭上跟他们在蒋军中的父兄、儿子和丈夫谈话。广播员们每次都以崇高的人道主义精神接待了他们。这些蒋军家属从广播喇叭上向他们在蒋军中的家人告诉家中的一切，告诉家里过节买了多少斤面，称了多少斤肉，买布给哪个孩子做了新衣裳，哪个孩子进了学堂，读书成绩怎样，以及人民政府给他们家里贷了多少款，家里添置了多少农具、渔具，这一年或这一季家里的收入增加了多少等等。有一次，家居小嶝岛的一个蒋军人员的女儿，在广播喇叭中向她在蒋军中的爸爸和哥哥谈话时伤心地问道：“别人家过年过节，一家人都在一起，欢欢乐乐，可是爸爸和哥哥你们为什么不回来？”当她这样问的时候不禁伤心的哭起来了。这时广播员们当即安慰她说：“如果你的爸爸和哥哥想到你，就会回来的。”
    今年7月以来，广播员们一次又一次地播送周恩来总理关于和平解放台湾的发言的录音，从这时起，金门岛上蒋军阵地前沿设了值班炮，专门轰击这支广播喇叭。安置这支广播喇叭的堡垒上落了很多炮弹，堡垒被打毁了，广播员们便把广播时间由白天改为夜晚，他们背着沉重的喇叭，经常地变换着广播的地点，顽强地不间断地继续向蒋军官兵播音。这支广播喇叭发出的宏亮的声音，每到夜晚便消除了大海的阻隔和人为的障碍，像磁石般地把金门岛上蒋军官兵的心灵引回祖国大陆的怀抱和他们温暖的故乡。　（新华社福建前线5日电）
