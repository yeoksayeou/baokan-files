    Maintain Roads Well, Let Cars Run Fast
    National Highway Maintenance Conference Determines Current Central Tasks for Road Maintenance

    (Our newspaper dispatch) The National Highway Maintenance Conference concluded in Beijing on August 28th. In response to the current unprecedentedly tight highway transportation situation, the conference determined that the maintenance and repair of road surfaces should be the central task of road maintenance. The conference believes that maintaining a level road surface greatly helps to increase driving speed, accelerate vehicle turnover, and increase transportation capacity, thereby resolving the current tension of insufficient transport capacity and transportation congestion. Based on the 1955 automobile transport capacity, volume, and mileage, if the average driving speed is increased by five kilometers per hour, its value is equivalent to increasing the transportation capacity of two thousand vehicles per day. The conference pointed out that highway maintenance and repair work in the future should rely on the masses, use local materials, focus on maintaining road surfaces, provide comprehensive maintenance, prioritize repairs, improve quality in stages, and gradually improve quality. It also pointed out that in addition to managing and maintaining the existing national and provincial highways, it is also necessary to pay close attention to the management and maintenance of county and township roads. To this end, a method of hierarchical management and maintenance should be gradually implemented, with provincial and regional transportation (highway) departments responsible for the management and maintenance of national and provincial highways, and county people's committees responsible for the management and maintenance of county and township roads. In maintenance, it is necessary to earnestly implement the State Council's instructions and give full play to the power of civilian labor to maintain highways.

    把道路养好，让汽车快跑
    全国公路养护会议确定当前养路中心工作
    本报讯全国公路养护会议8月28日在北京闭幕。会议针对当前公路运输空前紧张情况，确定以路面的养护修理为当前养路的中心工作。会议认为保持路面平正，对提高行车速度，加速车辆周转，增加运输能力，从而解决当前运力不足、运输堵塞的紧张情况，有很大的帮助。以1955年的汽车运力、运量和行驶里程为根据，如果行车时速平均提高五公里，其价值就等于每天增加二千辆汽车的运输能力。会议指出今后公路养护修理工作应该依靠群众、就地取材，以养好路面为中心，全面养护，重点修理，分期改善，逐步提高质量；并指出除管好、养好现有的国、省道外，还必须十分重视县、乡道的管理与养护。为此，要逐步实施分级管理与养护的方法，国、省道由省、区交通（公路）厅负责管理与养护，县、乡道由县人民委员会负责管理与养护。在养护中要切实贯彻国务院的指示，充分发挥民工建勤的力量，养护公路。
