    Correctly Treat Party Members Who Have Made Mistakes
    Bai Ye
    At the Nanjing Municipal Party Congress held in June of this year, the following incident was exposed and criticized: Party member Zheng Jiaxiang, originally the son of a poor peasant, joined the revolutionary army in 1939 at the age of sixteen, serving as a guard, medic, and quartermaster. He was commended three times in battle. After crossing the Yangtze River in 1949, he was transferred to the former Nanjing Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce Joint Sales Office as director due to injury and weakness. At this time, under the attack of "sugar-coated bullets," he accepted bribes from illegal capitalists and embezzled one million yuan (old Renminbi). During the "Three-Anti" campaign in 1952, his mistakes were exposed. He received a disciplinary sanction of being placed on probation within the Party for two years, and administratively he was dismissed from his post (then serving as the secretary of the Xiaguan Branch of the Municipal Taxation Bureau). From then on, it was as if the mark of "mistake-maker" was branded on his forehead, and he was discriminated against and attacked everywhere. When jobs were assigned, many units kicked him around like a football, and he was transferred fourteen times in more than two years. Recently, when the leadership of the Nanjing Department Store discussed promoting cadres, some people thought that Zheng Jiaxiang's conditions were not bad in all aspects and suggested that his position be promoted, but one leader refused outright, saying, "How can this be done! He is a cadre who has made mistakes!"
    Zheng Jiaxiang made his mistake seven years ago. The punishment he received was revoked two years ago. Why is he still regarded as a mistake-maker? We know that the issue of the attitude towards Party members who have made mistakes is an extremely important issue for our Party in handling internal contradictions. However, many of our Party organizations have adopted incorrect attitudes towards Party members who have made mistakes. Zheng Jiaxiang's experience is one example.
    Some of our Party organizations, when implementing Party discipline on certain Party members who have made mistakes, have not implemented the policy of "both strict and cautious." The main manifestation is that they often one-sidedly emphasize the seriousness of implementing discipline when dealing with Party members who have made mistakes, without conducting a comprehensive analysis and research based on the nature of their mistakes and their attitude towards the mistakes. For example, some forcibly link historical mistakes that have been corrected with today's mistakes, emphasizing the consistency of the mistakes in order to deal with them severely; some sever history, emphasizing only the seriousness of today's mistakes, without studying the causes of the mistakes and his consistent performance; some treat general problems as matters of principle, or regard shortcomings in ideological style as political mistakes, and give inappropriate punishments. This bias is more common and serious in rural Party organizations. Some people even mistakenly believe that "it is impossible to solve problems without giving severe punishments to rural Party members." Jinzhong Township in Nantong County has a total of 123 Party members (49 of whom were newly developed last winter and this spring). In the past two years, 14 have been disciplined, including 4 who were expelled from the Party and 2 who had their jobs revoked. The problem is not only that the scope of punishment is too wide, but also that many of the punishments are too severe. As a result, some punished Party members cannot sincerely recognize their mistakes and correct them, which affects the positive effect of implementing Party discipline.
    Some of our Party organizations also do not pay attention to respecting the due rights of punished Party members. One situation is: although they verbally admit that "all those who are not satisfied after being punished may defend themselves and may request reconsideration and appeal to higher-level authorities" (Article 66 of the Party Constitution), when the punished Party member actually raises different opinions, they think he is not honest; some even think that some Party members who appeal to higher-level authorities are deliberately confronting the Party, and instead of conducting a detailed investigation and verifying the facts based on the punished Party member's appeal to make a fair handling, they instead look for "materials" from all aspects to aggravate his punishment. Another situation is: some Party organizations do not actively help some Party members who have accepted punishment to correct their mistakes, and do not revoke the punishment of those Party members who have corrected their mistakes on time. Party member Zhu Congfu, when working in the warehouse of the Tangzha Factory Manager Department of the Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Nantong City in the spring of 1953, caused deterioration of cottonseed and loss of people's property due to lack of strong sense of responsibility in his work, and was placed on probation within the Party for six months. After the expiration of the term, after discussion by the branch general meeting, it was unanimously agreed to cancel the punishment and sent to the Organization Department of the Nantong Municipal Party Committee for approval. However, more than three years have passed since now, and Zhu Congfu's punishment has not been revoked. During this period, he wrote sixteen reports and made many oral inquiries, but the Organization Department of the Nantong Municipal Party Committee has not given any reply. The bureaucratic style of the Organization Department of the Nantong Municipal Party Committee, which is irresponsible to the political life of Party members, is not an isolated case.
    Why do some of our Party organizations have such deviations in treating Party members who have made mistakes? This involves the issue of understanding the mistake itself. Some people always have the view that our Communist Party members are members of the vanguard of the working class and should be people with a high degree of political literacy and class consciousness, so they should not make mistakes. It is of course right to say that Party members should not make mistakes as a requirement. But the actual situation is not the case, because first, our Party does not exist in isolation from society. The ideological influence of the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie is constantly invading the Party, and when Party members are infected with the ideology of the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie, it is inevitable that they will make mistakes; second, because we do not know enough about the complex reality and lack work experience, there will inevitably be contradictions between the subjective and the objective. As long as such contradictions exist, it is inevitable to make mistakes in work. Because of this, Marxism-Leninism theoretically affirms that there can be no saints in the world who do not make any mistakes. Our Party has established a system of criticism and self-criticism to constantly overcome shortcomings and correct mistakes, and established an iron discipline to ensure the unity of thought and action within the Party.
    It is completely right for the Party organization to criticize or punish a Party member who violates Party discipline according to the size of his mistake and the reason for making the mistake. It is even necessary to expel individual people who insist on making mistakes and refuse to correct them despite repeated teachings in order to maintain Party discipline. It is wrong to have unprincipled sympathy and reluctance for Party members who have made mistakes. However, the purpose of criticism or punishment is to help comrades who have made mistakes correct their mistakes, so that they can recognize the cause of the mistakes, find ways to correct the mistakes, and avoid repeating similar mistakes in the future. We have seen from many facts that the vast majority of Party members who have made mistakes are able to actively correct their mistakes after being criticized or punished. Some even further train themselves to become stronger Party members in the lesson of "a fall into the pit, a gain in your wit." This is the active purpose of the Party's criticism and punishment of Party members who have made mistakes. This is why the Party holds the spirit of "learning from past mistakes to avoid future ones, curing the sickness to save the patient" for all Party members who have made mistakes.

    正确地对待犯了错误的党员
    白烨
    在今年6月份举行的南京市党代表大会上，揭发和批评了这样一件事情：党员郑嘉翔，原是一个贫农的儿子，1939年他十六岁的时候，就参加了革命部队，当过警卫员、卫生员、军需员。在战斗中曾立过三次功，1949年渡江后，因负伤体弱转业到前南京市工商联营分销处当主任。这时，他在“糖衣炮弹”的侵袭下，接受了不法资本家的贿赂，贪污了一百万元（旧人民币）。1952年“三反”时，他的错误被揭发了，党内受到留党察看两年的处分，行政上被撤职（当时担任市税务局下关分局秘书股长）。从此在他的额角上就像打上了“犯错误者”的烙印一样，到处受到歧视和打击；分配工作时，很多单位像踢皮球似的把他踢来踢去，在两年多的时间内，他被调动了十四次工作。最近南京市百货公司领导上讨论提拔干部的时候，有人认为郑嘉翔各方面条件不差，建议把他的职务提升一下，但有位领导人员却一口拒绝说：“这怎么行！他是犯过错误的干部呀！”
    郑嘉翔犯错误是七年以前的事情了，他所受的处分，早在两年前就撤销了，为什么至今还把他当做犯错误的人看待呢？我们知道，对待犯了错误的党员的态度问题，是我们党在处理党内的是非矛盾中的一个极端重要的问题。而我们还有不少党组织，对待犯过错误的党员采取了错误的态度。郑嘉翔的遭遇就是一个例子。
    我们有些党组织，对某些犯错误的党员执行党的纪律时，没有贯彻“既严肃又慎重”的方针。主要表现在他们对待犯错误的党员，往往片面地强调执行纪律的严肃性，而不根据他的错误的性质以及他对错误的态度，进行全面的分析研究。如有的把人家已经改正了的历史上的错误，牵强附会地和今天的错误联系在一起，强调错误的一贯性，去从严处理；有的则割断历史，只强调今天错误的严重性，而不去研究犯错误的原因和他的一贯表现，有的则把一般性的问题，当成原则性的问题；或把思想作风上的缺点，当成政治上的错误，给予不适当的处分。这种偏向，在农村党组织中，更为普遍和严重。有些人更错误地认为“对农村党员，不给严重处分不解决问题。”南通县金中乡，共有党员一百二十三人（其中有四十九人是去冬今春才发展的新党员），近两年来，受到党纪处分的有十四名，其中开除党籍的就有四名，撤销工作的两名。问题还不在于处分的面太宽，而且其中有不少处分是偏重的，这样，就不能使某些受处分的党员心悦诚服地认识自己的错误和改正自己的错误，影响了执行党纪的积极作用。
    我们也有些党组织，还不注意尊重被处分的党员的应有权利。一种情况是：他们虽然口头上也承认：“凡被处分后不服者，均可进行辩护，并可要求复议及向上级机关申诉。”（党章第六十六条）但当被处分的党员，真正提出不同意见时，就认为他不老实；甚至有的认为某些向上级机关申诉的党员是有意和党对抗，不仅不根据被处分党员的申诉，详细地进行调查，核对事实，作公正的处理，反而从各方面去找“材料”加重他的处分。另一种情况是：某些党组织对于一些已经接受了处分的党员，没有积极地帮助他们改正错误，并且按时撤销那些已经改正了错误的党员的处分。党员朱从富，1953年春天在南通市省供销合作社唐闸工厂经理部仓库工作时，因为工作责任心不强，造成棉子变质，损失了人民财产，受到留党察看六个月的处分。期满以后，经过支部大会讨论，一致同意取消处分，送到南通市委组织部去批复。可是直到现在三年多了，朱从富的处分还没有撤销。在这期间，他曾写过十六次报告和多次口头询问，南通市委组织部却一直没有片纸只字的答复。类似南通市委组织部这种对党员政治生命不负责任的官僚主义作风，并不是个别的。
    我们的某些党组织，为什么对待犯错误的党员，存在着这么一些偏差呢？这里涉及到一个对犯错误这件事的本身的认识问题。有些人总有这样一种看法：我们共产党员是工人阶级的先锋队的一员，应该是有高度的政治修养和阶级觉悟的人，因此不应该犯错误。党员不应该犯错误，作为一种要求来说，当然是对的。但实际情况并不是如此，因为第一，我们的党不是离开社会而孤立存在的。资产阶级、小资产阶级的思想影响不断侵袭到党内来，而当党员沾染了资产阶级、小资产阶级的思想就难免不犯错犯；第二，由于我们对复杂的现实情况了解不够，工作的经验不足，必然会发生主观和客观的矛盾，只要存在着这样的矛盾，工作上犯错误也是不可避免的。正因为如此，马克思列宁主义才从理论上肯定世界上不可能有不犯任何错误的圣人，在我们党内才建立了不断克服缺点，改正错误的批评和自我批评的制度，建立了保证党内思想行动统一的铁的纪律。
    一个党员违反了党的纪律，党组织根据他的错误的大小及犯错误的原因，给予他批评或处分是完全应该的；对于个别坚持错误屡教不改的人，为了维护党的纪律，直到开除出党都是必要的。对犯错误的党员采取无原则的同情和吝惜是不对的。但是，批评也好，处分也好，它的目的，都是为了帮助犯错误的同志改正错误，使他认识到错误发生的原因，找出改正错误的途径，避免以后再重犯类似的错误。我们从许多事实中看到，绝大多数犯了错误的党员，在受到批评或处分之后，是能够积极地改正错误的。有的甚至在“吃一堑，长一智”的教训中，进一步把自己锻炼成为一个更坚强的党员。这就是党对犯了错误的党员进行批评与处分的积极目的。这就是为什么党对一切犯错误的党员都抱着“惩前毖后，治病救人”的精神的出发点。
