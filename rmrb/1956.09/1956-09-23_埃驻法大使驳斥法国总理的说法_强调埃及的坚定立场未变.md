Xinhua News Agency, Paris, September 22nd: The Egyptian Ambassador to France, Nabi, refuted on the 21st the claim, reportedly made by French Prime Minister Mollet, that Egypt had abandoned its firm stance on the Suez Canal issue.

According to French newspapers, Mollet told his cabinet that the Egyptian government had "retreated" from its "tough" position, allowing ships that had not paid tolls to Cairo to pass through the canal and not retaining non-Egyptian pilots.

Commenting on the newspaper reports, Ambassador Nabi said, "The purpose of the penalties stipulated in the Canal Nationalization Act is to prevent sabotage. The Egyptian government does not intend to deprive these pilots of their freedom."

The ambassador said, "The Egyptian government's approval for them to leave Egypt proves that Egypt can manage without French and British pilots, and it also proves that it is fully capable of ensuring the smooth operation of the canal through its own means."

He said that Egypt allowed ships that refused to pay tolls to pass through "is a demonstration of its spirit of reconciliation, not an abandonment of its rights."

Nabi emphasized: "Far from retreating, Egypt's attitude clearly demonstrates its concern for the needs of the world economy and its respect for international obligations, and emphasizes its willingness to achieve reconciliation within the scope of its dignity and sovereignty."

    埃驻法大使驳斥法国总理的说法
    强调埃及的坚定立场未变
    新华社22日讯　巴黎消息：埃及驻法国大使纳比在21日驳斥了据说是法国总理摩勒所说的埃及在苏伊士运河问题上已经放弃了它的坚定立场的说法。
    据法国报纸报道说，摩勒告诉他的内阁：埃及政府已经从它的“强硬”的立场“退却”，它让没有给开罗付通行费的船只通过运河，也没有把非埃及籍的引水员留下来。
    纳比大使在评论报纸的这项报道时说：“运河国有化法案规定惩罚的目的，是为了防止破坏，埃及政府并没有打算剥夺这些引水员的自由。”
    这位大使说：“埃及政府批准他们离开埃及，这证明了埃及没有法国和英国的引水员也能干下去，也证明了它完全有力量保证能够用它自己的办法使运河顺利地进行工作。”
    他说，埃及允许拒绝交纳通行税的船只通行，“是表现了它的和解精神，而不是放弃它的权利”。
    纳比强调说：“埃及的态度远远不是退却，这个态度清楚地表明它关心于世界经济的需要和它尊重国际义务，并且强调说明了它愿意在它的尊严和主权的范围内实现和解”。
