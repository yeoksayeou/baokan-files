Xinhua News Agency, September 11th -- TASS reports: On September 10th, working people of Moscow held a mass rally in the Pillar Hall of the House of Trade Unions, angrily protesting the ban on the German Communist Party.

The delegation of the German Communist Party, headed by Max Reimann, was invited to attend the rally. When they took their seats on the presidium, the entire hall welcomed them with warm applause.

Krestyaninov, Chairman of the Moscow Regional Trade Union Council, delivered the opening speech, saying, "The working people of Moscow warmly support the statement issued by the CPSU Central Committee regarding the ban on the German Communist Party. The working people of Moscow support the heroic struggle of the German Communist Party for the interests of the German people, for peace, democracy, and the cause of socialism."

Shirochinkov, a fitter at the Transformer Factory, spoke next. He said, "What is happening in West Germany today involves not only the Communists, not only the Germans, but also all those who have personally experienced the German 'New Order.' The people of all countries have learned much from past painful experiences, and they clearly remember that fascist terror followed closely after the ban on the German Communist Party in 1933. This is why we denounce the Adenauer authorities' infringement upon the democratic freedoms of the German people. It is precisely because of this that we are agitated and uneasy about this move by the Bonn militarists.

We Moscow workers firmly believe that the German working class will never yield and will persist in the struggle until this shameful verdict is overturned."

Kosmodemyanskaya, mother of the Soviet heroine Zoya, spoke on behalf of the women of Moscow. Then, the writer Fedin also spoke. They all angrily protested against this sinister action by the West German authorities.

Reimann, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the German Communist Party, spoke at the rally, describing the situation in Germany. He was warmly welcomed by the entire hall.

The assembly passed a resolution condemning the decision of the West German authorities to outlaw the German Communist Party and demanded that the working people of West Germany resolutely resist the attacks of the West German reactionary forces on the German Communist Party.

    莫斯科人民集会抗议取缔德共
    德国共产党代表团在大会上受到热烈欢迎
    新华社11日讯　据塔斯社报道：莫斯科劳动人民9月10日在工会大厦圆柱大厅举行群众大会，愤怒抗议取缔德国共产党。
    以马克斯·雷曼为首的德国共产党代表团应邀参加大会，当他们在主席团席位上就座时，全场热烈鼓掌欢迎。
    莫斯科州工会理事会主席克列斯蒂扬尼诺夫致开会词说：“莫斯科劳动人民热烈支持苏共中央就德国共产党遭到禁止一事发表的声明。莫斯科劳动人民支持德国共产党为德国人民利益、为和平、民主和社会主义事业进行的英勇斗争”。
    变压器工厂装配工希罗钦科夫接着发言。他说：“今天在西德发生的事不仅牵涉到共产党人，不仅牵涉到德国人，而且也牵涉到所有亲身体验过德国‘新秩序’的人们。各国人民从过去的痛苦经验中学到了许多东西，他们清楚的记得，紧跟着1933年取缔德国共产党以后就出现了法西斯恐怖。这就是我们痛斥阿登纳当局侵犯德国人民民主自由的原因。也正是因为这样，波恩军国主义分子的这个作法使我们感到激动和不安。
    我们莫斯科工人坚定地相信，德国工人阶级决不会屈服，一定会把斗争坚持到这一可耻判决被废除的时候为止”。
    苏联英雄卓娅的母亲科斯莫杰米扬斯卡娅代表莫斯科妇女发言。接着，作家费定也发了言。他们都愤怒地抗议西德当局的这一罪恶行动。
    德国共产党中央委员会第一书记雷曼在大会上讲了话，叙述了德国情况。他受到了全场的热烈欢迎。
    大会通过一项决议，谴责西德当局宣布德国共产党非法的决定，并且要求西德劳动人民坚决反击西德反动力量对德国共产党的进攻。
