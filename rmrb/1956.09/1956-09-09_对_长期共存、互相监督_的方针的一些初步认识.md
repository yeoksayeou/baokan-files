    Some Preliminary Understandings of the Policy of "Long-Term Coexistence and Mutual Supervision"
    Xiong Kewu
    The Chinese Communist Party Central Committee's proposal of the policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" between the Communist Party and various democratic parties has not only greatly encouraged the members of the democratic parties but has also attracted the attention and importance of many countries. As Minister Li Weihan pointed out, "This is a major policy." To fully understand the significance of this policy, it is necessary to conduct theoretical research and, more importantly, to experience it in practice. Now, I am just putting forward some preliminary understandings of my own.
        Accepting Leadership and Mutual Supervision
    In his speech at the Third Session of the First National People's Congress, Li Weihan, Minister of the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee, gave a very high evaluation of the role played by the democratic parties over the years. He said: "Years of experience have proved that the democratic parties not only play an important role in uniting and mobilizing all positive forces, but also play an important role in mutual supervision." This is a realistic assessment and an encouragement to us.
    Some people believe that the democratic parties are under the leadership of the Communist Party, and therefore they cannot or should not supervise the Communist Party. This statement is not in line with the facts. As everyone knows, in our country, mutual supervision is mainly carried out through criticism and self-criticism, and the Communist Party welcomes criticism from all sides. We see that in recent years, whether in the organs of power or in the consultative bodies, there has been criticism and self-criticism. In particular, at the Third Session of the First National People's Congress, many representatives, including members of various democratic parties, not only put forward many suggestions on the work of the government, but also made very sharp criticisms of certain deviations and shortcomings in the work. This is a kind of supervision of the government, and also a kind of supervision of the Communist Party. At the symposiums convened by the United Front Work Departments at the central and local levels, the people from the democratic parties who participated in the symposiums also spoke freely and put forward many opinions for improving the work, and they were not limited to opinions on the united front work. These facts all show that the Communist Party sincerely welcomes non-Party members to make criticisms, and also reflects that the democratic parties can play a certain role in supervision of the Communist Party. However, our ability to put forward some positive suggestions and criticisms is of course due to the fact that we have conducted studies, participated in various revolutionary practices, contacted the masses of the people, and also done some necessary investigations and researches under the leadership of the Communist Party. Therefore, the fact that our democratic parties can play a certain role in mutual supervision is primarily inseparable from the Communist Party's many years of close care, help and support for us. It can be said that "accepting leadership" and "mutual supervision" are by no means contradictory.
    If "mutual supervision" is understood as "rivaling each other," it is of course a serious political error; on the other hand, turning "accepting leadership" into "relying on leadership" cannot give full play to the role of the democratic parties. We know that the Communist Party's leadership over the democratic parties is mainly political leadership. It hopes that the democratic parties will give full play to their political freedom and organizational independence within the scope of the rights and obligations conferred by the Constitution. If we do not develop the spirit of independent thinking, delve deeply into and understand the guiding policies of the leading party, and shrink back in our work, doing whatever the United Front Work Department says and doing nothing if it does not say, this kind of thinking of "dependence" and "waiting" is actually a reflection of insufficient political responsibility, and cannot truly play the role of an assistant to the leading party. Especially after the policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" was put forward, the members of our democratic parties need to deeply understand the Communist Party's spirit of respecting the political freedom and organizational independence of the democratic parties. On the one hand, we must earnestly accept the leadership of the Communist Party in politics, and on the other hand, we must strengthen our initiative and creativity in our work, so that we can give full play to the due role of our democratic parties, including the role of mutual supervision.
      Division of Labor and Cooperation and Long-Term Coexistence
    In recent years, under the leadership of the Communist Party, the democratic parties have implemented division of labor and cooperation, and have played a good role in consolidating and expanding the people's democratic united front. The division of labor among the democratic parties in the united front is not subjectively determined by any party or individual, but because each democratic party has its own different historical characteristics and social foundation, and therefore a necessary division of labor is naturally formed in terms of contacting the masses.
    In order to implement the policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision," I believe that the democratic parties not only need to continue to have a division of labor, but also should better concentrate their efforts in the future, go deep into the classes and strata they are connected with, and carry out meticulous work of unity and education. Some people believe that if the democratic parties still have a division of labor, it will be difficult for them to exist for a long time, because the classes and strata they are connected with will soon disappear. Others believe that today the members of the democratic parties and the objects they are connected with are relatively old, and their long-term existence will inevitably be limited by the laws of nature, so they propose that the democratic parties should develop young people. We know that political parties are the product of classes. The reason why there are so many democratic parties in China is because different classes and strata exist in our society. In the future, when socialism is built, although classes will be eliminated, the ideology of non-working classes will still have its influence on many people. To enable the ideological consciousness of many non-working class members to adapt to their changed social status is a long-term and arduous task, and it is a historical task that awaits our democratic parties to continue to work hard to complete. After the Third National Congress of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK), many upper and middle-class people who were scattered in society and had historical relations with the original Kuomintang have taken the initiative to ask the RCCK organizations to establish contact with them. This shows that the RCCK's decision to take the original Kuomintang and the upper and middle-class people who have historical relations with the original Kuomintang as the main objects of unity, education, and transformation is correct and in line with objective needs, based on its own historical characteristics and social relations. If the RCCK does this work well, it will be conducive to the socialist cause. And experience shows that, due to historical and social relations, the RCCK has more convenient conditions for uniting and educating these people than other parties.
        The Key Lies in Doing a Good Job
    Our country's people's democratic united front has a long way to go. Our democratic parties must work with the people of the whole country, under the leadership of the Communist Party, carry forward the fine tradition of division of labor and cooperation, and do our work more, faster, better, and more economically, in order to meet the requirements of mobilizing all positive factors to serve socialism. I personally believe that the key to both long-term coexistence and making people pay more attention to the democratic parties lies in doing a good job. Minister Li Weihan said it well: "We should publicize the policy of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision. This can both help people clarify their doubts about the political role and historical status of the democratic parties, and is enough to encourage the members of the democratic parties to engage in more activities that are beneficial to the people. On the one hand, the understanding and evaluation are clarified, and on the other hand, more beneficial things are done, people's perceptions will further change, the opinions of the democratic parties will be more valued by all parties, and their work and activities will be more supported by all parties." Let us all take practical actions to implement this major policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision"! As for how long long-term coexistence will last, I think it is best to let history answer this question. Since democratic parties are the product of Chinese history and society, it is contrary to the objective laws of historical development to abolish or maintain them by artificial means!

    对“长期共存、互相监督”的方针的一些初步认识
    熊克武
    中共中央提出共产党和各民主党派“长期共存、互相监督”的方针，不但使民主党派的成员受到极大的鼓舞，也引起了许多国家的注意和重视。诚如李维汉部长所指出的：“这是一个重大的方针”，要全面地认识这一方针的意义，必须在理论上进行研究，更需要从实践中去体会，现在只是提出个人一些初步的认识。
        接受领导与互相监督
    中共中央统战部李维汉部长在第一届全国人民代表大会第三次会议上的发言中，对于各民主党派多年来所发生的作用作了极高的评价。他说：“多年来的经验证明，各民主党派不但在团结和动员一切积极力量方面起着重要的作用，而且在互相监督方面也起着重要作用。”这是一个实事求是的估计，也是对我们的一种鼓舞。
    有人认为民主党派是受共产党领导的，因而它不能或者不应该监督共产党。这种说法是不符合事实的。大家知道，在我们的国家里，实行互相监督主要就是通过批评与自我批评，而共产党是欢迎各方面的批评的。我们看，几年来无论在权力机关或协商机关中，都是有批评与自我批评的，特别是在第一届全国人民代表大会第三次会议上，许多代表，包括属于各民主党派成员的代表在内，不但对政府的工作提出了许多建议，同时对于某些工作上的偏差和缺点，也提出了极尖锐的批评，这就是对政府的一种监督，也就是对共产党的一种监督。在中央和各地统战部召集的座谈会上，各民主党派参加座谈的人，也都畅所欲言，提出了许多改进工作的意见，而且不限于对统战工作方面的意见。这些事实都说明共产党是竭诚欢迎党外人士提出批评，也反映民主党派对于共产党是能够起一方面的监督作用的。但是我们能够提出一些积极性的建议和批评，当然由于我们在共产党的领导下，进行了学习，参加了各项革命实践，联系了人民群众，也作了一些必要的调查研究。所以我们民主党派能够在互相监督方面起着一定的作用，首先是和共产党多年来对我们的亲切关怀、帮助和支持分不开的。“接受领导”与“互相监督”可以说绝不矛盾。
    如果把“互相监督”理解为“分庭抗礼”，当然是一个严重的政治错误；另一方面把“接受领导”变为“依赖领导”也不能够充分发挥民主党派的作用。我们知道，共产党对民主党派的领导主要是政治领导，它是希望民主党派在宪法所赋予的权利义务范围内，充分发挥自己的政治自由和组织独立性的。如果我们不发扬独立思考的精神，深入地钻研和体会领导党的方针政策，在工作中缩手缩脚，统战部说一样做一样，不说就不做，这种“依赖”和“等待”的思想，实际上是政治责任感不够的反映，并不能真正起到作为领导党一方面的助手的作用。特别是在“长期共存、互相监督”的方针提出以后，我们民主党派的成员，更需要深刻体会共产党尊重各民主党派政治自由和组织独立的精神，一方面在政治上切实接受共产党的领导，另一方面要在工作中加强主动性和创造性，这样才能充分发挥我们民主党派应有的作用，包括互相监督的作用。
      分工合作与长期共存
    几年来，各民主党派在共产党的领导下，实行分工合作，在巩固与扩大人民民主统一战线方面起了良好的作用。各民主党派在统一战线中有所分工，不是由任何一个党派或个人主观决定的，而是由于各民主党派都有其不同的历史特点和社会基础，因此在联系群众方面就自然形成了一种必要的分工。
    为了贯彻“长期共存、互相监督”的方针，我认为各民主党派不但需要继续有所分工，而且今后应该更好地集中力量，深入所联系的阶级和阶层，进行细致的团结教育的工作。有人认为各民主党派仍然有所分工，就难于长期存在，因为它们所联系的阶级阶层不久的将来就会消亡。也有人认为今天各民主党派成员及所联系的对象年龄都比较大，它们的长期存在就不免要受到自然规律的限制，所以提出民主党派要发展青年的主张。我们知道政党是阶级的产物，中国之所以有这么多的民主党派，是因为我们的社会存在着不同的阶级和阶层。将来社会主义建成，虽然阶级消灭了，可是非工人阶级的思想，对于许多人们仍然将发生它的影响，要使许多非工人阶级分子的思想意识能够同他改变了的社会地位相适应，是一项长期而艰巨的工作，也就是有待于我们民主党派继续努力来完成的一个历史任务。民革第三届全国代表大会以后，许多散处在社会上的原国民党及与原国民党有历史关系的中上层人士都主动地要求民革组织与他们建立联系，这就说明民革根据本身的历史特点和社会关系，决定以原国民党及与原国民党有历史关系的中上层人士为团结、教育、改造的主要对象是正确的，符合客观需要的，民革做好了这一工作，就有利于社会主义事业。而经验表明，由于历史和社会的关系，民革对这些人士进行团结、教育，较其它党派是有着较便利的条件的。
        关键在于做好工作
    我国的人民民主统一战线是任重而道远的，我们民主党派必须和全国人民一道，在共产党的领导下，发扬已有的分工合作的优良传统，把自己的工作做得又多、又快、又好、又省，才符合调动一切积极因素为社会主义服务的要求。我个人认为无论是长期共存或者是使人们更为重视民主党派，关键都在于做好工作。李维汉部长说得好：“我们应当宣传长期共存和互相监督的方针。这既可以帮助人们澄清他们对于民主党派的政治作用和历史地位的怀疑，又足以鼓励各民主党派的成员更多地从事有益于人民的活动。一方面，认识和估计澄清了，另一方面，有益的事情作得多了，人们的观感就会进一步发生变化，民主党派的意见就会更加受到各方面的重视，它们的工作和活动就会更加受到各方面的支持。”让我们大家都以实际行动来贯彻“长期共存、互相监督”这个重大的方针吧！至于长期共存究竟长到什么时候，这个问题我认为最好让历史来回答。民主党派既然是中国历史社会的产物，那么，无论是以人为的方法来取消它或者维系它，都是违反历史发展的客观法则的！
