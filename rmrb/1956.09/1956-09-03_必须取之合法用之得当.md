    Recently, many leading cadres of organs and enterprises have gone deep into the masses to investigate and study, and have solved many problems in the lives of employees from various aspects in response to the demands of the masses, which has been welcomed by the masses. This is a good phenomenon. But there are also bad phenomena. Some organs and enterprises, although they have spent a lot of money exceptionally, seem to be working hard to meet the demands of the masses, but in fact, the money is used improperly, which has aroused dissatisfaction among the masses. The grassroots trade union of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications requested the administration to advance more than 17,000 yuan of public funds to purchase a large number of radios and watches for more than 200 people, which is an example. They are not helping employees with difficulties solve the most pressing problems in their lives, but using public funds to allow employees to purchase high-end consumer goods. This is no longer a matter of solving the difficulties of employees, but a collective misappropriation of public funds.
    Perhaps the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications and the trade union of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications believe that this approach is to seek welfare for the working masses and can strengthen the connection between the trade union and the masses! Yes, the trade union should strive to maximize the satisfaction of the material and cultural needs of the masses. However, when we solve problems, we should solve the most pressing life problems, and we should solve problems within the scope allowed by the national system. Is buying watches and radios the most pressing issue? Obviously not. Many people in the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications itself are asking the government to provide housing, some houses are leaking and there is no money to repair them, some rent private houses and owe dozens of yuan in rent, some themselves and their families are sick and cannot afford medical expenses, and some employees cannot let their children participate in summer camps because they have no money. The trade union is not very enthusiastic about these issues, but is enthusiastic about misappropriating public funds to buy high-end consumer goods. Is buying high-end consumer goods more urgent than these issues?
    Perhaps doing so will strengthen ties with the masses and encourage the masses to work with peace of mind? The fact is not so. Their practice of violating financial discipline has aroused dissatisfaction among many comrades in the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications. Just when the trade union conveyed the notice of organized purchase on credit, many people opposed the misappropriation of public funds, but the trade union did not listen; many comrades with difficult lives asked the trade union to help solve their problems, but the trade union did not vigorously help them unload their burdens; how can the trade union strengthen its connection with the masses?
    The state requires spending less money and doing more things, but the trade union of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications is spending more money and doing wrong things. The task of the trade union is to strengthen communist education, but they are undermining the financial system, giving many people who like to take advantage of the public a chance to exploit loopholes. It is said that almost all the people who "purchase on credit" in a certain division of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications have savings in the bank, including the deputy director, deputy section chief, and section chief. This will not only increase unnecessary personal expenses, but also be detrimental to the country.
    It can be seen from this that this practice is neither in line with the national system nor realistic. When solving the life problems of the masses, we oppose both indifferent bureaucracy and extravagant spending that is merely the icing on the cake.

    必须取之合法用之得当
    满正
    最近，许多机关和企业的领导干部都深入群众，调查研究，针对着群众的要求，从多方面着手解决了职工生活中的不少问题，受到群众欢迎。这是好现象。但是还有不好的现象。有些机关和企业虽然破例花了不少钱，好像在努力满足群众要求，实际上，钱用得不当，反而引起了群众不满。邮电部基层工会向行政要求垫支公款一万七千多元，为两百多人购买大批收音机和手表，就是一个例子。他们不是帮助有困难的职工解决生活中最迫切的问题。而是由公家垫支公款让职工购买高级消费品，这已经不是什么解决职工生活困难的问题，而是集体挪用公款了。
    也许邮电部和邮电部工会认为这种作法是为职工群众谋福利，可以加强工会与群众的联系吧！是的，工会应该去努力争取最大限度地满足群众物质和文化生活的要求，可是，在我们解决问题的时候，应该解决最迫切的生活问题，应该在国家制度所允许的范围内来解决问题。购买手表和收音机是不是最迫切的问题呢？显然不是。邮电部本身还有许多人要求公家给房子住，有的房子漏雨了无钱修理，有的租了私人的房子拖欠下几十元的房租，有的本人和家属生了病还不起药费，也有的职工因为没有钱，不能让孩子去参加夏令营。工会对这些问题不大热心，却热心于挪用公款买高级消费品，难道买高级消费品比这些问题还迫切吗？
    也许这样做会加强同群众的联系，鼓励群众安心工作吧？事实也不是这样。他们这种破坏财政纪律的作法，已引起邮电部许多同志的不满。就在工会向下传达组织赊购的通知时，就有不少人提出反对挪用公款，工会没有倾听；许多生活有困难的同志要求工会帮助解决，工会没有大力帮助去卸包袱；工会同群众的联系又怎样加强呢？
    国家要求少花钱多办事，邮电部工会是多花钱办错事，工会的任务是加强共产主义教育，他们却破坏财政制度，给许多喜欢占公家便宜的人钻了空子。据说邮电部有一个司差不多所有“赊购”的人在银行都有存款。其中包括副司长、副处长和科长。这样做，不仅会增加个人不必要的开支，对国家更是不利的。
    由此可见，这种作法既不合乎国家制度，也不切合实际。我们在解决群众生活问题的时候，既反对漠不关心的官僚主义，也反对锦上添花的胡乱开支的行为。
