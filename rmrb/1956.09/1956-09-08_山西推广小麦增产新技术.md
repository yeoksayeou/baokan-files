Shanxi Promotes New Wheat Yield-Increasing Techniques

    (Our report) To accelerate the increase in wheat yield per unit area, Shanxi Province has decided to vigorously promote new yield-increasing technologies in this year's wheat sowing work, such as soaking seeds in baking soda and alkaline water, and seed fertilization. These advanced yield-increasing technologies have been tested in Shanxi Province, and the general results are very good. The Yuncheng County Agricultural Experiment Station found that wheat soaked in baking soda generally yielded more than wheat not soaked by 16% or more. Agricultural cooperatives in Nanzhongzhuang and Shangzhen, Wenxi County, experimented with wheat soaked in baking soda and increased yields by 23%-27%. Soaking in alkaline water also produced significant yield increases. In terms of wheat seed fertilization, according to experiments conducted by the Huanghua Agricultural Cooperative in Xiangning County, wheat that has been fertilized generally yields more than 20%. This is truly a good method that costs little, increases production significantly, and is simple and easy to implement. In order to implement these new technologies, the Shanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture discussed and arranged them at the provincial wheat conference as early as the end of June, requiring that the area of wheat fields using baking soda and alkali soaking reach 50% of the total winter wheat area in the province, and that seed fertilization should also be vigorously promoted throughout the province. At present, the supply departments in Shanxi Province are actively carrying out the allocation of baking soda and other materials.

    (Another dispatch) In order to do a good job in wheat sowing and lay a solid foundation for increasing production next year, the Shanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture has organized staff to go to Jinan, Changzhi, Yuci and other regions to check the preparation work for wheat sowing. The content of this inspection includes: the area of wheat sowing, the preparation of seeds, the accumulation of fertilizer and the supply of commercial fertilizer, the modification of close planting drills, the supply of ten-row seeders, and the preparation of wheat fields. In addition, the establishment of seed retention plots and yield-increasing demonstration areas, the prevention and control of diseases and insect pests, seed fertilization, baking soda soaking, and the organizational arrangements of agricultural cooperatives' labor and animal power will also be further inspected. This inspection will take the method of listening to reports at each level and going deep into the fields for inspection, from the region to the county, from the county to the township, from the township to the cooperative, and from the cooperative to the team. In the inspection, we must also visit the "wise" and ask about the "bitter", to understand both the local advanced experience and the specific difficulties in promoting advanced experience. The Shanxi Provincial People's Committee has notified all localities to conduct a general inspection of the preparation work for wheat sowing. The Jinan, Yuci, and Changzhi regions will also conduct cross-inspections between regions. Each region will also organize cross-inspections between counties within its own region to achieve the purpose of mutual inspection, mutual learning, and improvement. (Guo Shi)

    山西推广小麦增产新技术
    本报讯　为了加速提高小麦单位面积产量，山西省决定在今年小麦播种工作中大力推广小苏打浸种和碱水浸种、种子肥育等新的增产技术。这些先进增产技术，在山西省经过了试验，一般效果很好。运城县农业试验站，用小苏打浸种的小麦一般比不浸种的小麦增产16％以上。闻喜县南中庄、上镇等农业社试验，用小苏打浸种的小麦增产23％—27％。用碱水浸种增产效果也相当显著。在小麦种子肥育上，据乡宁县黄华农业社试验，经过种子肥育的小麦一般能增产二成以上。这真是花钱少、增产大、又简便易行的好办法。山西省农业厅为了贯彻实施这些新的技术，早在6月底全省小麦会议上就做了讨论和布置，要求全省采用小苏打和碱面浸种的麦田面积达全省冬小麦总面积的50％，种子肥育也要在全省范围内大力推广。目前山西省各供应部门正在积极进行小苏打等物质的调拨工作。
    又讯　为了做好小麦播种工作，给明年增产打好基础，山西省农业厅组织工作人员分赴晋南、长治、榆次等专区，检查小麦播种准备工作。这次检查的内容，包括：小麦播种面积，种子准备情况，积肥情况和商品肥料的供应，密植耧的改制，十行播种机的供应，麦田整地等等。此外，对留种地和增产示范区的建立、病虫防治、种子肥育、小苏打浸种、农业社劳力畜力组织安排等问题，也都要进一步检查。这次检查采取由专到县、由县到乡、由乡到社、由社到队，逐级听取汇报和深入田间检查相结合的方法。在检查中，还要访“贤”问“苦”，既了解当地先进经验，也了解推广先进经验中的具体困难。山西省人民委员会已通知各地，普遍进行一次对小麦播种准备工作的检查，晋南、榆次、长治三专区并举行专区与专区之间进行交叉检查。每个专区也要在本区范围内组织县跟县的交叉检查，以达到互相检查互相学习和提高的目的。　（郭石）
