I fully endorse the political report made by Comrade Liu Shaoqi on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party, and I fully endorse the reports made by Comrade Zhou Enlai and Comrade Deng Xiaoping.

My speech aims to explain: the main situation of the purge campaign in our country and some experiences in implementing the Party's correct line in the purge campaign. I request comrades to examine, criticize, and correct it.

After the founding of the People's Republic of China, a new situation emerged in the struggle between revolution and counter-revolution: on the one hand, the Kuomintang reactionary regime was overthrown, and imperialism was driven out of mainland China; on the other hand, there were still a large number of counter-revolutionary remnants in the country, the Chiang Kai-shek clique was still entrenched in Taiwan, and imperialism was still watching us from the sidelines. At that time, Comrade Mao Zedong had the following assessment of the situation, he said: "The imperialists and domestic reactionaries will never be reconciled to their defeat, and they will still make a final struggle. After the country is pacified, they will still engage in sabotage and disruption in various ways, and they will try to restore China every day and every hour. This is inevitable and beyond doubt. We must not relax our vigilance." The evolution of the situation in our country over the past seven years has proved that Comrade Mao Zedong's assessment is completely correct.

To Consolidate the Victory of the Revolution and Develop National Construction - It Is Necessary to Resolutely Eliminate the Counter-Revolutionary Remnants

As everyone remembers, the domestic counter-revolutionary remnants, with the support of the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek clique and imperialism, once vainly attempted to cooperate from within and without to restore reactionary rule at a time when the victory of the Chinese people had not yet been consolidated. The counter-revolutionary remnants blatantly launched a frenzied attack on the people, organizing counter-revolutionary underground armies and political bandits, carrying out harassment, riots, and various acts of sabotage, and assassinating revolutionary cadres and activists among the masses. The people of our country clearly saw that in order to consolidate and develop the victory of the revolution and build our country, it was necessary to unswervingly and thoroughly eliminate all counter-revolutionary remnants.

Over the past seven years, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, the people of our country have waged a tense and fierce struggle against counter-revolution, which has been concentratedly manifested in two large-scale campaigns to suppress counter-revolution. The first campaign to suppress counter-revolution began in 1950 when our country was carrying out the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, land reform, and the restoration of the national economy. The Party Central Committee issued the famous Double Ten Directive in October 1950, put forward the task of resolutely suppressing counter-revolution, and led the people of the whole country to launch this movement in a big way, focusing on attacking the five aspects of counter-revolutionaries who were still oppressing the people at that time, such as bandits, local tyrants, special agents, backbone members of reactionary parties and groups, and heads of reactionary secret societies, and severely punishing a group of principal culprits who had committed serious crimes against the people and the motherland. The second movement began in 1955 when the high tide of socialist revolution in our country was about to arrive. At that time, the activities of the remaining counter-revolutionaries showed a tendency to rise again. The Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong instructed us: We must systematically, analytically, and realistically give the counter-revolutionaries a few more blows to further weaken the remaining counter-revolutionary forces, so as to ensure the safety of our country's socialist construction. In this movement, a group of hidden counter-revolutionaries were identified in state organs, people's organizations, and inside the Communist Party, various democratic parties; in society, the remaining counter-revolutionaries were dealt another heavy blow.

The campaign to suppress counter-revolution achieved a decisive victory in eliminating the remaining counter-revolutionary forces, greatly weakening the remaining counter-revolutionary forces. They have fallen into a state of extreme isolation and wavering disintegration. Now, it is fundamentally impossible for counter-revolutionaries to restore in China; it is also more difficult for them to engage in sabotage and disruption. Of course, the imperialists will still engage in subversive activities in various ways in the future. They set up huge spy agencies and use huge amounts of special funds for such a sinister purpose. However, as long as we thoroughly eliminate the domestic counter-revolutionary remnants, our struggle against imperialism will be much more advantageous.

The campaign to suppress counter-revolution mobilized hundreds of millions of people across the country. The broad masses of the people rose up to eliminate the remaining counter-revolutionary forces, thoroughly liberating themselves politically, thus greatly raising their patriotism and socialist consciousness, and greatly bringing into play their enthusiasm for revolutionary struggle and various constructions. The campaign to suppress counter-revolution eliminated a group of counter-revolutionaries hidden within the working class and the people, greatly reducing the space for counter-revolutionaries to carry out sabotage activities, consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship in our country, ensuring the completion of the national economic recovery work, and ensuring the smooth progress of socialist construction and socialist transformation.

Main Experiences in the Struggle Against Counter-Revolution

The decisive key to the great victory of the purge campaign in our country lies in the correct leadership of the Party. Our Party has accumulated rich experience in the struggle to build and consolidate revolutionary base areas and in the long-term struggle against counter-revolution. This experience is mainly:

        Studying and Mastering the Laws of Struggle

First, the Party has become familiar with and mastered the laws of the purge campaign in its long-term struggle, thus ensuring correct guidance for the struggle. The purge campaign is a hidden, complex, and sharp struggle. In this struggle, the following situation often occurs: when all the enemy's sabotage and suspicious signs have not occurred, people are always prone to numbness and lack of vigilance, leaving themselves unprepared for counter-revolutionary conspiracies and sabotage. And once counter-revolutionary sabotage occurs, or suspicious signs of counter-revolutionary sabotage have already appeared, because of lack of preparation, it is easy to panic, feeling that there are spies everywhere, and any movement of the grass becomes a soldier, often confusing some ideological errors or work errors similar to reactionary remarks and actions with counter-revolutionary sabotage activities, thus exaggerating the enemy. At the same time, in places where numbness is serious, once the struggle is launched, excessive actions are prone to occur, and after the excessive actions are corrected, numbness is prone to rise again. In mass purge campaigns, this change in conversion is sometimes very rapid.

It is not surprising that such laws appear in the purge campaign. This is because the enemy fighting against us is hidden. They hide in every corner and every aspect, using cunning and despicable double-dealing methods to carry out sabotage activities secretly. This sabotage is often an unexpected attack. It is precisely because of this that we are easily blinded by temporary illusions in our understanding of the enemy situation, and prone to subjectivity and one-sidedness. Sometimes we regard bad people as good people, and sometimes we suspect good people with certain shortcomings and mistakes as bad people. In such a complex struggle, it is indeed difficult to judge the rapidly changing situation in a timely and correct manner, and to immediately distinguish all the good people from the bad people. This is the objective and subjective reason why right-leaning or "left-leaning" deviations are prone to occur in the purge campaign.

It should be stated that although right-leaning or "left-leaning" deviations are prone to occur in the purge campaign, these deviations are not impossible to prevent. If we are familiar with and master the laws of the purge campaign to correctly guide the struggle, then these deviations can be prevented, and even if these deviations occur in some places, they can be corrected in a timely manner. If we do not see such laws and want to guide the struggle, we will inevitably make mistakes. In the early days of the Second Domestic Revolutionary War, several of our revolutionary base areas made mistakes of this nature because they lacked experience, which caused losses to the revolution. The purge campaign in the Yan'an period was conducted better because of past experience and familiarity with the laws of struggle. Although there were some deviations in the middle, they were easily corrected. In the purge campaign of the past seven years, our Party has gained more abundant experience and is more familiar with the laws of struggle. There are fewer deviations, and when there are deviations, they are corrected more promptly. Therefore, we can not only boldly launch large-scale purge campaigns, but also ensure the normal and healthy development of the struggle and achieve victory in the struggle.

Therefore, studying and mastering the laws of the purge campaign is very important. We must constantly improve our consciousness in the struggle, avoid blindness, correctly carry out struggles on two fronts, and take various effective measures to prevent in advance or correct in a timely manner the right-leaning or "left-leaning" deviations that may arise in the struggle. This is the responsibility of the leadership, and it is also the art of leadership.

Adhering to the Policy of Combining Seriousness and Prudence

Second, based on its historical experience and a deep understanding of the laws of the purge campaign, the Party stipulated that the purge campaign must adhere to the policy of combining seriousness and prudence. The so-called seriousness means that as long as there is counter-revolution, we must resolutely carry out the struggle, and we will never give up until the counter-revolution is completely eliminated. The so-called prudence means that in the purge campaign, we must carefully distinguish between right and wrong and the seriousness of the matter, oppose rashness, and resolutely protect good people while attacking counter-revolutionaries.

The Party has taken a series of prudent measures in investigating and handling the issue of counter-revolutionaries. A measure of decisive significance is the strict control over the arrest and killing of counter-revolutionaries. The Party Central Committee has always insisted that the arrest of counter-revolutionaries must be cautious, and the killing of counter-revolutionaries must be especially cautious. During the high tide of the first campaign to suppress counter-revolution in 1951, it was stipulated that: all counter-revolutionaries who could be arrested or not arrested should not be arrested; if they were arrested, it would be a mistake; all counter-revolutionaries who could be killed or not killed should not be killed; if they were killed, it would be a mistake. And after the counter-revolutionaries suffered a serious blow from their frenzied sabotage, the policy of arresting and killing less was immediately insisted upon. The Party Central Committee also made special provisions for the handling of counter-revolutionaries involved in the following ten aspects in the large-scale campaign to suppress counter-revolution, that is: counter-revolutionaries identified in the ten aspects of the Chinese Communist Party, the People's Government system, the People's Liberation Army system, democratic parties, people's organizations, ethnic minorities, the cultural and educational circles, the business community, the religious community, and returned overseas Chinese must be strictly reviewed by the leading organs above the provincial level before a decision can be made on their disposal. For counter-revolutionaries who should be arrested according to law, only a small number of those who must be arrested are arrested according to law. Among the counter-revolutionaries who should be killed according to law, only a very small number of those who have committed heinous crimes, aroused great popular indignation, and are really impossible not to be killed are killed. In the movement to eliminate hidden counter-revolutionaries within the organs, the Party Central Committee implemented a more cautious policy than the campaign to suppress counter-revolution in society, and kept the scope of the struggle to a minimum. In the purge campaign, the Party insisted that full preparations must be made, and that the struggle must not be launched lightly unless preparations have been made, the enemy situation has been investigated clearly, and the policies have been explained clearly. The Party also strictly required that good people and bad people, ideological issues and political issues should be distinguished in the struggle, and that good people with errors and shortcomings, as well as those who only have reactionary ideas but no counter-revolutionary behavior, should not be confused with counter-revolutionaries. Experience has proved that only by adhering to the above-mentioned cautious principles can we ensure that we do not commit or commit fewer major errors, especially errors that are difficult to recover.

In 1955, Comrade Mao Zedong once again pointed out that the following principles should be resolutely followed in the purge campaign at that time: "Raise vigilance, eliminate all special agents; prevent deviations, do not wrong a single good person." This precisely shows that the combination of seriousness and prudence, resolutely eliminating counter-revolutionaries and resolutely protecting good people, is the unified and inseparable policy that our Party has consistently adhered to in leading the purge campaign.

Implementing the Policy of Combining Punishment with Leniency

Third, the Party's policy of combining seriousness and prudence in the purge campaign is reflected in the policy towards counter-revolutionaries, that is, the policy of combining punishment with leniency, the specific content of which is: principal culprits must be punished, accomplices are not questioned, confession is treated leniently, resistance is treated severely, meritorious service is rewarded, and great meritorious service is awarded. Punishment and leniency are closely linked and cannot be abandoned. The formulation of this policy is based on the specific circumstances of the counter-revolutionaries and the great historical mission of our Party to transform society and transform mankind.

The situation of counter-revolutionaries in our country can be roughly divided into three categories. One category is the backbone members of the counter-revolutionaries. They account for a considerable number. These people have committed heinous crimes and aroused great popular indignation, and are the diehards among the remaining counter-revolutionary forces. Even now, there are still a few such counter-revolutionaries who are continuing to carry out sabotage activities. One category is the general members of the counter-revolutionaries. They account for the majority. These people have committed crimes, but they are not very serious; they engage in counter-revolutionary activities, but they are not very determined, and are the wavering members among the remaining counter-revolutionary forces. When our suppression of the rampant activities of the counter-revolutionary backbone members is not strong, they will actively engage in counter-revolutionary activities, even committing more and greater crimes; but when the people rise up and give the resolute counter-revolutionaries a severe blow, they will waver, and as long as we implement the correct policies, a large number of them will be likely to confess and surrender to us. One category is the coerced members of the counter-revolutionaries. They also account for a considerable number. These people were forced to participate in counter-revolutionary organizations, or occasionally participated in certain counter-revolutionary sabotage activities, and their crimes are relatively minor, and they are unwilling or not completely willing to be counter-revolutionaries.

Based on the above situation, we adhere to the principle of punishing the few and transforming the majority when dealing with counter-revolutionaries. That is to say: those counter-revolutionaries who have committed heinous crimes in history, aroused great popular indignation, refuse to confess, or continue to engage in sabotage activities after liberation, especially after being treated leniently, must be punished according to law. Among the counter-revolutionaries who must be punished according to law, except for the very few who have committed heinous crimes and are really impossible not to be sentenced to death, the vast majority of the remaining counter-revolutionaries are sentenced to imprisonment and labor reform. Among the counter-revolutionaries who deserve to be sentenced to death, those who have no blood debts, have not aroused great popular indignation, or have seriously damaged the interests of the state but have not reached the most serious level, are given the policy of "sentencing to death, suspending execution, forcing labor, and observing the effect," giving them the last chance to repent. Those counter-revolutionaries who have only committed general crimes and are not resolutely hostile to the people are not arrested, and are given control or not given control, depending on the specific circumstances. All counter-revolutionaries who confess and surrender themselves, even if they are backbone members of the counter-revolutionaries, are given lenient treatment, those who deserve to be sentenced to death may not be sentenced to death, those who have performed meritorious service may have their sentences reduced or their crimes offset, and those who have performed great meritorious service are awarded.

Our main purpose in implementing the policy of combining punishment with leniency towards counter-revolutionaries is to transform all counter-revolutionaries who can be transformed into people who are useful to society, so as to fundamentally eliminate counter-revolutionary activities. Therefore, we implement labor reform for counter-revolutionary criminals who are sentenced to imprisonment according to law, in accordance with the principle of combining political education with labor production. This work has achieved remarkable results, and has indeed transformed many criminals into people who rely on their own labor to start a new life again. We also work hard to those who have committed minor crimes and do not need to be detained, as well as those who have been released after serving their sentences, and do everything possible to help them find employment, so that they can receive further education and transformation in labor and work. According to Article 5 of the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) proposed by our Party Central Committee in January 1956, we have absorbed the above-mentioned members into agricultural cooperatives as formal members or alternate members, or placed them in cooperatives for controlled production, according to their different situations and different performances. Those members in the cities are also being dealt with appropriately in accordance with this spirit. This method is another important development of our country's policy of transforming counter-revolutionaries.

Implementing the Mass Line of Mobilizing the Whole Party and Mobilizing the Masses

Fourth, the purge campaign must implement the mass line, mobilize the whole Party, mobilize the masses, and mobilize everyone to deal with counter-revolutionaries. The mass line is the Party's fundamental political line and organizational line, which is of course a fundamental issue for the purge campaign and the people's public security organs. It is a question of mobilizing the majority of people to fight against counter-revolutionaries, or only allowing a few people to fight in isolation. The reason why we were able to eliminate a large number of remaining counter-revolutionary forces in a relatively short period of time without making major mistakes in the purge campaign is that our Party boldly mobilized the masses, so that the purge campaign had both the leadership of the Party and the reliance of the masses.

The purge campaign represents the vital interests of the people and reflects the just demands of the people. As long as the Party shows its determination to thoroughly eliminate the remaining counter-revolutionary forces and has correct leadership, the broad masses of the people will surely dare to rise up and fight against counter-revolutionaries. At the same time, any counter-revolutionary hides among the masses, attempting to use the masses' lack of vigilance to carry out sabotage activities. As long as the broad masses of the people, especially the masses in an intermediate and backward state, are mobilized, and their political vigilance and ability to identify counter-revolutionaries are improved, it will be enough to illuminate any dark corner, making it difficult for all counter-revolutionaries to escape the eyes of the masses. The numerous vivid facts in the purge campaign of the past seven years fully demonstrate that the political consciousness and revolutionary vigilance of the broad masses of the people are the most valuable forces among the forces that we use to defeat all counter-revolutionaries.

However, boldly mobilizing the masses does not mean that the Party relaxes its leadership over the struggle, lowers the Party to the level of the ordinary masses, and becomes the tail of the masses. The Party is the commander and organizer of the struggle. At the same time, boldly mobilizing the masses does not mean that the work of special organs can be dispensed with or weakened. Special organs must both rely on the masses and lead the masses, becoming the backbone of the mass struggle. Only when special organs are combined with the broad masses can we eliminate a large number of remaining counter-revolutionary forces and defeat any cunning enemy.

In order to lead the masses and gain the support of the masses, the Party must first let the masses know the significance, purpose, policies, and methods of the purge campaign. To this end, we must widely adopt various forms of publicity, vigorously carry out publicity work, so that the significance of the purge campaign and the Party's policies are deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, and everyone understands them. The seven years of struggle have proved that when the Party's correct guidelines and policies are understood and mastered by the masses, they become an incomparably huge material force. Moreover, the masses who have mastered the policies can, on the one hand, become active implementers of the Party's policies; on the other hand, they can also supervise the people's public security organs and other judicial organs to correctly implement the Party's policies.

In order to widely mobilize the masses, we must resolutely oppose isolationism and mysticism in public security work. Isolationism and mysticism are a remnant influence from the reactionary ruling class. Any reactionary ruling class oppresses the masses, and of course it is afraid of the masses and does not want the masses. Our people's public security organs serve the interests of the people, and should be and have always been trusted by the masses and relied upon by the masses. However, some of our public security personnel often inappropriately exaggerate the certain particularity of the purge campaign, forgetting the masses. They think that the purge campaign can only be done by a few "experts," and that the masses are powerless. This view is, of course, wrong.

Isolationists and mystics often use "keeping secrets" as a shield to avoid implementing the mass line. In fact, keeping secrets is consistent with relying on the masses. As long as we trust the masses, rely on the masses, and the masses' consciousness is raised, it will be more conducive to keeping secrets. Isolationists and mystics are always pretentious, sneaky, and think they are very secretive. In fact, they not only cannot keep secrets, but also arouse the masses' suspicion and become alienated from the masses.

Isolationists and mystics always refuse to implement the mass line on the grounds that they are afraid of the masses' "panic" and afraid of the masses' "excesses." They are often timid and do things in a small way. As a result, the more they dare not boldly mobilize the masses, the more likely it is to cause panic and suspicion among the masses; when the masses rise up, they do not dare to lead them, and it is more likely to cause certain excesses. Only by resolutely abandoning isolationism and mysticism, and only by adhering to the mass line that combines special organs with the broad masses under the leadership of the Party, can these phenomena be completely avoided.

Emphasizing the Style of Investigation and Research and Seeking Truth from Facts

Fifth, the purge campaign must emphasize investigation and research and seek truth from facts. Investigation and research are the basis for the Party to decide policies and carry out all work. Comrade Mao Zedong repeatedly taught us, "Without investigation, there is no right to speak." This truth is important for any work, and it is especially important for the purge campaign. Because the object of the purge campaign is the hidden enemy, in order to correctly judge the situation of the enemy's activities in each period, make appropriate estimates, make the deployment of the purge campaign conform to the objective reality, and base all our measures on a reliable foundation, truly knowing the enemy situation and having a clear purpose, it is necessary to emphasize investigation and research work even more. At the same time, if we do not have investigation and research work, or investigation and research work is not done well, it will not only be difficult to discover the deeply hidden enemy, but even if we discover them, it will be difficult to obtain solid evidence, clarify the nature of the problem, and make appropriate treatment.

Completely opposite to investigation and research and seeking truth from facts is the method of extorting confessions and believing them. This is to arrest people rashly based only on some one-sided and untested materials. After arresting people, they often easily believe the prisoner's confession, and even use torture and disguised torture to extort confessions, believing the confessions extorted, and then arresting people again. This is a subjective and anti-Marxist method, and the result will inevitably exaggerate the enemy's strength. Our Party committed this error in the purge campaign during the Second Domestic Revolutionary War and suffered some losses, but we gained an experience, that is, we must implement full investigation and research and resolutely oppose extorting confessions and believing them.

To oppose extorting confessions and believing them, we must absolutely prohibit torture and all disguised torture. Our Party has always strictly prohibited torture to extract confessions, because torture to extract confessions can only cause us to make mistakes and does not help us defeat the enemy. Our struggle is just and is supported by the broad masses of the people. We have no need to adopt this barbaric and wrong method. Our Party has always emphasized paying attention to evidence rather than relying on confessions lightly, and the evidence must be repeatedly tested to be true and solid, not false evidence. Investigation work must also be repeatedly checked, and the problems reflected must be comprehensive and in line with reality, rather than subjective and one-sided, listening to one side and believing it. This is the scientific attitude of seeking truth from facts. Only in this way are we truly powerful.

Strengthening Party Leadership and Mass Supervision

Sixth, in order to ensure the correct conduct of the purge campaign, the Party's leadership and the supervision of the Party and the masses must be strengthened for the people's public security organs. The people's public security organs are an important tool of the people's democratic dictatorship and a sharp weapon for the Party and the state to oppose domestic and foreign enemies. If this weapon is used well, it can strike at the enemy and defend ourselves; if it is not used well, it will hurt ourselves and the people. Therefore, the Party's leading role in the people's public security organs must be strongly emphasized.

Our Party has learned a lesson on this issue. During the Second Domestic Revolutionary War, the vertical leadership of the independent system of security organs was incorrectly emphasized, which made the security organs at all levels lose the leadership and supervision of the Party committees at all levels, thus making mistakes. Since the Zunyi Conference in 1935, the Party Central Committee has corrected this mistake and insisted on implementing the correct leadership system for the people's public security organs at all levels, that is, placing the public security organs at all levels under the actual leadership of the Party Central Committee and the Party committees at all levels, and placing the security organs of the army under the leadership and supervision of the army's Party committees and political organs. In the national system, a dual leadership system is also implemented instead of a vertical leadership of the public security organs. Within the public security organs at all levels, a system that combines the collective leadership of the Party group and the responsibility of the chief leader is implemented. This has enabled us to avoid repeating past mistakes.

Regarding strengthening the leadership and supervision of the Party over the people's public security organs, the Party Central Committee has made the following provisions for the Party groups of the public security organs: all issues of principle and policy in public security work must be reported to the Party Central Committee for discussion and approval. In addition to regular discussions and inspections, the Central Committee, the Provincial (Municipal) Committee, the Prefectural Committee, and the County Committee should hold special discussions and systematic inspections twice a year on public security work and make corresponding decisions. No matter what the work is, the Party group of the public security organ must not keep secrets from the Party on the pretext of the special nature of the work. Major issues must be reported in advance and reported afterwards. Otherwise, it is an act of being unorganized and undisciplined, and it is an act of independence from the Party. The people's public security organs are a department of the Central People's Government and the people's governments at all levels, and they carry out their work under the leadership and supervision of the Central People's Government and the people's governments at all levels. However, the Party's leadership and supervision of the public security organs is not only not contradictory to the government's leadership and supervision of the public security organs, but also consistent. All important issues in public security work should be brought to the government for discussion and corresponding resolutions, instructions, or the promulgation of corresponding orders. This can effectively strengthen the government's leadership over public security work, and is conducive to mobilizing the masses and organizing people from all walks of life in the people's democratic united front to actively participate in the purge campaign, and is conducive to the supervision of the people and people from all walks of life.

All activities of the people's public security organs must strictly abide by the provisions of the Constitution and laws, establish a correct system of division of labor, mutual responsibility, and mutual restraint with the procuratorial organs and the courts, and conscientiously obey the supervision of the state's legal supervision organs. The people's public security organs should report their work to the people through people's congresses at all levels and various mass meetings, and pay attention to listening to the criticisms and suggestions of the masses at any time, so as to obtain the supervision of the broad masses of the people. The inspection of the purge work by the representatives of the people's congresses has played a powerful supervisory role, and this work should be continued to be strengthened in the future. The people's public security organs should also strengthen supervision from top to bottom and from bottom to top within the organs.

The above-mentioned aspects of supervision have played a role, which is of extremely important significance for ensuring the correct conduct of the purge campaign and public security work. The Party's supervision plays a decisive role in these aspects of supervision.

The above listed are the main experiences that the Party has gained in leading the purge campaign conducted by the people of the whole country. These experiences, when put together, are: the purge campaign is carried out under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and the Party committees at all levels, mobilizing the whole Party, mobilizing the masses, adhering to the policy of combining seriousness and prudence, adhering to the principle of "raising vigilance, eliminating all special agents; preventing deviations, do not wrong a single good person," implementing the policy of combining punishment with leniency, adhering to the method of investigation and research and seeking truth from facts, strictly prohibiting torture to extract confessions, and abiding by the revolutionary legal system. Combining all these is the Party's correct line in leading the purge campaign.

As everyone knows, this systematic and complete correct line of the purge campaign is the development of the Party's purge campaign line during the Yan'an Rectification and Cadre Examination period in 1943. As early as that time, the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong had proposed the famous "Nine Guidelines," which are: the chief leader is responsible, personally take action, combine leading backbone members with the broad masses, combine general appeals with individual guidance, investigate and research and oppose extorting confessions and believing them, distinguish between right and wrong and the seriousness of the matter, win over those who have stumbled, train cadres, and educate the masses. The Nine Guidelines concentratedly summarized the mass creations of the purge campaign at that time, and fully accepted the experiences of the purge campaign in the historical period before the Zunyi Conference, including failed experiences and successful experiences. Therefore, the Nine Guidelines in the Yan'an period had already established a correct line for our Party to lead the purge campaign. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, our Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong have continued to concentrate on many experiences and creations of the purge campaign, making our line more developed and more complete. It can be said with certainty that the victory of the purge campaign in our country is the victory of the Party's leadership, and it is the victory of the Party's correct line in the purge campaign.

Shortcomings and Mistakes in Our Work

However, it should be pointed out that our public security organs have made some shortcomings and mistakes in the actual work of implementing the Party's line, and some of these shortcomings and mistakes are even serious.

In the seven years of the purge campaign, we have shown left-right swaying phenomena in certain periods and in certain links. In the more than half a year before October 1950, the public security organs across the country did not effectively combat the sabotage activities of counter-revolutionaries, and there had been right-leaning errors of "boundless leniency." In the later period of the high tide of the campaign to suppress counter-revolutionaries in 1951, due to the lack of strict leadership control and the impurity of some local grass-roots organizations, there were "leftist" errors of different degrees of roughness and rashness in some places, arresting some people who could have been arrested or not arrested, and even killing a very small number of counter-revolutionaries who could have been killed or not killed, and even wrongly arresting individual good people. After the end of this campaign to suppress counter-revolutionaries, for about a year from the spring of 1954 to the spring of 1955, due to our overestimation of the degree of打击对反革命分子的程度, 对国内反革命残余势力还有相当数量的事实估计不足, there was an underestimation of the number of remaining counter-revolutionary forces in the country, thus we relaxed the打击对残余反革命分子的打击 for a short period, showing a right-leaning conservative thinking that was lagging behind the objective reality. Some shortcomings and mistakes also occurred in the purge campaign that began in the second half of 1955. Some counter-revolutionaries who could have been won over to surrender were arrested in society, and even individual good people were wrongly arrested. Within the organs, some units also had the shortcoming of a too wide a scope of struggle, and struggled against a few people who should not have been struggled against. Some people also overestimated the trend of enemy disintegration and disintegration, and could not see that there were still counter-revolutionaries, and produced new complacency.

These phenomena of left-right swaying mostly occurred at the turning point of the struggle situation, indicating that we did not grasp the situation deeply enough and that we did not implement the central government's guidelines and policies steadily enough. These mistakes are local and temporary in nature. They occurred in the course of implementing the Party's correct line, in specific work. Due to the close leadership of the central government and the Party committees at all levels, they were generally corrected in a timely manner, and some are still being examined and corrected. The Party Central Committee recently decided that for those who were wrongly struggled against, wrongly arrested, wrongly detained, and wrongly judged in the movement, we must conscientiously conduct inspections, do a good job of甄别 and rehabilitate them, and earnestly handle them properly. We must never ignore them just because they are individual or a small number of people.

In the actual work of implementing the Party's policies, the vast majority of public security organs and public security personnel were loyal and active, adhered to the Party's policies, and closely linked themselves with the broad masses of the people. However, there were also a small number of public security organs and some public security personnel who seriously had the old police style of coercion and command and being divorced from the masses, and had made mistakes in violating laws and discipline and undermining policies, and had even committed the illegal act of torture to extract confessions, which caused a very bad influence among the masses. Yang Fan, the former director of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau, and Bu Lu and Chen Kun, the former deputy directors of the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau, abused their powers, shielded special agents, and engaged in many criminal activities behind the backs of the Party and the people, causing even greater losses to the state and the people. Over the past few years, we have continuously launched struggles against such bad people and bad deeds, and we must continue to struggle against these phenomena in the future.

We also have shortcomings in the issue of complying with the legal system. After the promulgation of the Regulations on Arrest and Detention, some places still did not fully comply with the regulations to apply to the People's Procuratorate for approval of arrest within the prescribed time limit, and some did not notify the family members of the criminals in time after arresting them. In the management of criminals, there are also shortcomings in emphasizing production and neglecting education, and even individual places have errors in beating and abusing prisoners.

We also have certain tendencies of formalism and mysticism in侦察, guard and other business work, which have caused an adverse influence of being divorced from the masses in some places.

These shortcomings and mistakes show that our public security organs still have a serious style of subjectivism and bureaucracy. At the same time, some cadres of our public security organs also have extremely dangerous feelings of pride and complacency. They overestimated their achievements in the purge campaign, ignored the leading role of the Party and the government in themselves, ignored the role of close cooperation and mutual assistance among the relevant departments in the struggle against the enemy, and ignored the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of the people.

Eliminating Counter-Revolutionaries Is Still a Long-Term Struggle

We must overcome subjectivism and bureaucracy, strengthen work inspection, go deep into reality, and contact the masses. We must constantly carry out criticism and self-criticism, be humble and prudent, and guard against arrogance and impetuosity. We must improve the theoretical level of Marxism-Leninism and improve the combat ability of public security personnel. In the future struggle, we must better implement the Party's correct line and strive for victory in the struggle.

Comrades! Now the fierce period of class struggle in our country has passed, but the struggle between revolution and counter-revolution has not stopped and will not stop, and it is still a long-term struggle. Our enemies have been greatly weakened after repeated blows, and the number of counter-revolutionaries has been greatly reduced, but they have not been completely eliminated. Whether in society or within the organs, there are still remaining counter-revolutionaries, and there are still sabotage activities by a small number of resolute counter-revolutionaries. Wang Shutian, a residual counter-revolutionary in Beijing, killed worker Sun Ruihua in a murderous attack on June 29 this year; Zhuang Shimin, a hidden counter-revolutionary in the Qitai County Hospital in Xinjiang, killed Comrade Liu Dianying, deputy director of the Xinjiang Forestry Department, and two others in a murderous attack on June 28, injuring 11 others. These are two prominent examples.

    我国肃反斗争的主要情况和若干经验
    罗瑞卿同志的发言
    我完全拥护刘少奇同志代表党中央委员会所做的政治报告，完全拥护周恩来同志和邓小平同志的报告。
    我的发言想说明：我国肃反斗争的主要情况和执行党在肃反斗争中的正确路线的若干经验，请同志们审查、批评和指正。
    中华人民共和国成立以后，革命与反革命之间的斗争出现了新的形势：一方面，国民党反动政权被推翻了，帝国主义从中国大陆上被赶出去了；另一方面，国内还有大量的反革命残余势力，蒋介石集团还盘踞在台湾，帝国主义也还站在旁边窥伺着我们。当时，毛泽东同志对于这个形势有以下的估计，他说：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。在全国平定以后，他们也还会以各种方式从事破坏和捣乱，他们将每日每时企图在中国复辟。这是必然的，毫无疑义的，我们务必不要松懈自己的警惕性。”七年来我国情况的演变，证实了毛泽东同志的估计是完全正确的。
    要巩固革命胜利，发展国家建设  必须坚决肃清反革命残余势力
    大家记得，国内反革命残余势力，在台湾蒋介石集团和帝国主义的支持下，曾经妄图在中国人民的胜利还没有巩固下来的时候，实行里应外合，使反动统治复辟。反革命残余势力明目张胆地向人民疯狂进攻，组织反革命的地下军和政治土匪，进行骚扰暴乱和各种破坏，刺杀革命干部和群众中的积极分子。我国人民清楚地看到，要巩固和发展革命的胜利，建设我们的国家，就必须坚定不移地彻底肃清一切反革命残余势力。
    七年来，我国人民在中国共产党和人民政府的领导下，同反革命展开了紧张的、剧烈的斗争，集中地表现为两次巨大规模的镇压反革命运动。第一次镇压反革命运动，是在一九五○年我国抗美援朝、土地改革和国民经济恢复工作紧张进行的时候开始的。党中央在一九五○年十月发布了著名的双十指示，提出了坚决镇压反革命的任务，领导全国人民大张旗鼓地展开了这一运动，集中地打击了当时还压在人民群众头上的土匪、恶霸、特务、反动党团骨干分子和反动会道门头子等五个方面的反革命分子，严厉惩办了一批对人民、对祖国犯有严重罪行的首恶分子。第二次运动，是在一九五五年我国社会主义革命高潮行将到来的时候开始的。当时，残余反革命分子的活动又有抬头之势。党中央和毛泽东同志指示我们：必须有计划地、有分析地、实事求是地再给反革命几个打击，使残余反革命力量更大地削弱下来，借以保证我国社会主义建设事业的安全。这次运动，在国家机关、人民团体和共产党、各民主党派内部，清查出来了一批暗藏的反革命分子；在社会上，又给了残余的反革命分子一次沉重的打击。
    镇压反革命运动，取得了肃清反革命残余势力的决定性的胜利，使反革命残余势力大大地削弱下来了。他们已经陷于极端孤立和动摇分化的境地。现在，反革命要想在中国复辟，是根本不可能的了；他们要从事破坏和捣乱，也是更加困难了。当然，帝国主义者在今后也还会用各种方式来从事颠复活动的，他们设置庞大的特务机构，使用巨额的特务经费，都是为着这样一个罪恶的目的。但是，只要我们彻底肃清了国内反革命残余势力，我们同帝国主义的斗争就更加有利得多了。
    镇压反革命运动，发动了全国几万万人民群众。广大群众自己起来把反革命残余势力加以扫除，在政治上彻底解放了自己，因而大大提高了爱国主义和社会主义的觉悟，大大发挥了革命斗争和各种建设的积极性。镇压反革命运动，清除了一批暗藏在工人阶级和人民内部的反革命分子，大大缩小了反革命分子破坏活动的空隙，巩固了我国人民民主专政的政权，保证了国民经济恢复工作的完成，保证了社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的顺利前进。
    同反革命进行斗争的主要经验
    我国肃反斗争所以能够取得伟大胜利的决定关键，就是有党的正确领导。我们党在建设和巩固革命根据地的斗争中，在同反革命进行的长期斗争中，积累了丰富的经验。这些经验，主要的就是：
        研究和掌握斗争的规律
    第一、党在长期斗争中，熟悉和掌握了肃反斗争的规律，因而保证了对斗争的正确指导。肃反斗争是一种隐蔽的复杂的尖锐的斗争。在这种斗争中，常常出现这样的情况：当着敌人的一切破坏和可疑征象没有发生的时候，人们总是容易麻木不仁，缺乏警惕，使自己对于反革命的阴谋破坏处于没有准备的状态。而在一旦发生反革命的破坏，或者反革命破坏的可疑征象已经出现的时候，因为没有准备，又容易惊惶失措，感到特务如麻，草木皆兵，往往把某些类似反动言论、行动的思想错误或工作错误，同反革命的破坏活动混同起来，因而夸大了敌人。同时，在麻痹情绪严重的地方，一旦发动了斗争，就容易发生过火行动，而在纠正了过火行动以后，麻痹情绪又容易重新抬头。在群众性的肃反斗争中，这种变化的转换，有时是很快的。
    肃反斗争所以会出现这样的规律，并不奇怪。这是由于同我们做斗争的是暗藏的敌人。他们隐蔽在各个角落和各个方面，用狡猾的卑鄙的两面派的手法，偷偷摸摸地进行破坏活动。这种破坏活动又常常是出人意料的袭击。正是因为这样，就使我们在敌情认识上，容易被一时的假象所蒙蔽，容易发生主观性和片面性。有时把坏人当成了好人，有时又把有某些缺点和错误的好人怀疑成坏人。在这样复杂的斗争中，要及时正确地判断迅速变化着的情况，要立即分清所有的好人和坏人，有时确实是困难的。这就是肃反斗争中所以容易发生右的或“左”的偏向的客观原因和主观原因。
    应该说明，尽管肃反斗争中容易发生右的或“左”的偏向，但是，这种偏向并不是不可防止的。如果我们熟悉和掌握了肃反斗争的规律去正确地指导斗争，那么，这种偏向就是可以防止的，即使在某些地方发生了这种偏向，也能够及时加以纠正。如果看不见这样的规律，要去指导斗争，就必然会犯错误。在第二次国内革命战争初期，我们好几个革命根据地，因为没有经验，都犯过这样性质的错误，使革命受到过损失。延安时期的肃反斗争，因为有了过去的经验，比较熟悉了斗争的规律，因而斗争就进行得较好，在中间虽然出了若干偏向，也就很容易被纠正过来。七年来的肃反斗争，我们党有了更丰富的经验，更熟悉了斗争的规律，偏向更少了，有了偏向，纠正得更加及时了，所以既能够放手发动了大规模的肃反斗争，又能够保证斗争正常健康的发展，取得斗争的胜利。
    因此，研究和掌握肃反斗争的规律，是十分重要的。我们必须不断地提高斗争中的自觉性，避免盲目性，正确地开展两条战线的斗争，并采取各种有效措施，预先防止或者及时纠正斗争中可能产生的右的或“左”的偏向。这就是领导的责任，也是领导的艺术。
    坚持严肃与谨慎相结合的方针
    第二、党根据自己的历史经验，以及对肃反斗争规律的深刻的理解，规定了肃反斗争必须坚持严肃与谨慎相结合的方针。所谓严肃，就是只要还有反革命存在，我们就必须坚决进行斗争，不把反革命彻底肃清，决不罢手。所谓谨慎，就是在肃反斗争中必须仔细分清是非轻重，反对草率从事，在打击反革命分子的同时，要坚决保护好人。
    党在清查、处理反革命分子的问题上，采取了一系列的谨慎的措施。有决定意义的措施，就是对捕杀反革命分子实行了严格的控制。党中央历来坚持，捕反革命分子必须谨慎，杀反革命分子尤其必须谨慎。在一九五一年第一次镇压反革命运动的高潮时期，规定了：凡是可捕可不捕的反革命分子，一律不捕，如果捕了，就是犯错误；凡是可杀可不杀的反革命分子，一律不杀，如果杀了，就是犯错误。而在反革命疯狂破坏遭受严重打击以后，就立即坚持了更要少捕、少杀的方针。党中央对于在大规模镇压反革命运动中牵涉到以下十个方面的反革命分子的处置，还作了特别的规定，就是：在中国共产党内、人民政府系统内、人民解放军系统内、民主党派、人民团体、少数民族、文化教育界、工商界、宗教界和归国华侨等十个方面清查出来的反革命分子，必须经过省以上领导机关严格审查才能做出处置的决定，对于罪该逮捕的反革命分子，只依法逮捕其中少数非捕不可的分子，对其中依法该杀的反革命分子，只杀极少数罪恶很重，民愤很大，实在非杀不可的分子。在机关内部肃清暗藏反革命分子的运动中，党中央实行了比之社会上镇压反革命运动更加谨慎的方针，并且把斗争面控制在最小的范围以内。在肃反斗争中，党坚持必须做好充分的准备，凡是没有准备好，敌情没有调查清楚，政策没有交代明白，就一定不要轻率地发动斗争。党还严格要求在斗争中区别好人和坏人，区别思想问题和政治问题，不要把那些有错误有缺点的好人，以及那些只有反动思想没有反革命行为的人，同反革命分子混同起来。经验证明，只有坚持了上述这些谨慎原则，才可以保证不犯或者少犯重大的错误，特别是难于挽回的错误。
    一九五五年，毛泽东同志对于当时的肃反斗争，再一次指出了应该坚决遵循这样的原则：“提高警惕，肃清一切特务分子；防止偏差，不要冤枉一个好人”。这正是表明了，严肃与谨慎相结合，坚决地肃清反革命和坚决地保护好人，是我们党在领导肃反斗争中一贯坚持的统一的不可分割的方针。
    执行惩办与宽大相结合的政策
    第三、党在肃反斗争中的严肃与谨慎相结合的方针，体现在对待反革命分子的政策上，就是惩办与宽大相结合的政策，它的具体内容就是：首恶必办，胁从不问，坦白从宽，抗拒从严，立功折罪，立大功受奖。惩办与宽大，两者是密切结合不可偏废的。这个政策的制定，是根据反革命分子的各种具体情况而提出的，是根据我党改造社会、改造人类的伟大历史任务而提出的。
    我国反革命分子的情况，大体上可以分为三类。一类是反革命分子中的骨干分子。他们占有相当数目。这类分子的罪恶和民愤很大，是反革命残余势力中的死硬派。直到现在，还有少数这样的反革命分子，在继续进行破坏活动。一类是反革命分子中的一般分子。他们占有多数，这类分子，有罪恶，但不很严重；进行反革命活动，但不很坚决，是反革命残余势力中的动摇派。当着我们对反革命骨干分子的嚣张活动镇压不力的时候，他们就积极地进行反革命活动，以至犯更多更大的罪行；但是当着人民起来，给了坚决反革命分子以严厉打击的时候，他们便动摇起来，只要我们实行正确的政策，他们中间的一大批人，便有可能向我们坦白自首。一类是反革命分子中的胁从分子。他们也占有相当数目。这类分子被迫参加了反革命组织，或者偶尔参加了某些反革命破坏活动，罪恶比较轻微，而且是不愿意或者不完全愿意当反革命的。
    根据上述情况，我们在处理反革命分子的时候，坚持了惩办少数与改造多数的原则。这就是说：对于那些历史上罪恶很大、民愤很大、拒不坦白交代，或者在解放后特别是经过宽大处理后仍然继续进行破坏活动的反革命分子，必须依法惩办。在必须依法惩办的反革命分子中，除了对于极少数罪大恶极非杀不可的分子，依法判处死刑以外，对于其余绝大多类的反革命分子，都实行判处徒刑，劳动改造的政策。在罪该处死的反革命分子中，对于那些没有血债、民愤不大，或者虽然严重损害了国家利益，但是尚未达到最严重程度的反革命分子，实行“判处死刑，缓期执行，强迫劳动，以观后效”的政策，给他们以最后的悔改机会。对于那些仅有一般罪行，不是坚决与人民为敌的反革命分子，就一律不予逮捕，分别具体情节，给予管制或不予管制。对于一切坦白交代、投案自首的反革命分子，即令是反革命分子中的骨干分子，一律给予从宽处置，罪该处死的可以不判死刑，立有功劳的，可以减刑或者折罪，立了大功的，给予奖励。
    我们对于反革命分子实行惩办与宽大相结合的政策，其主要目的，就是要把一切可以改造的反革命分子，都改造成为对社会有用的人，从根本上肃清反革命活动。因此，我们对于依法判处徒刑的反革命罪犯，依照政治教育与劳动生产相结合的原则，实行劳动改造。这项工作已经取得了显著的成效，已经把许多罪犯，确实改造成了依靠自己劳动重新开始了新的生活的人。我们对于那些罪行轻微不需要关押的分子，以及刑满释放的分子，也用心地向他们进行工作，并尽一切可能帮助他们就业，使他们在劳动和工作中得到进一步的教育和改造。根据一九五六年一月，我党中央提出的全国农业发展纲要（草案）第五条的规定，我们对上述分子，按照他们的不同情况，不同表现，分别吸收他们参加了农业合作社做正式社员或者后补社员，或者放入合作社内管制生产。对于城市中的这类分子，也正在按照这样的精神，加以适当处理。这种办法，是我国改造反革命分子政策的又一个重要的发展。
    实行全党动员群众动员的群众路线
    第四、肃反斗争必须实行群众路线，实行全党动员，群众动员，发动大家起来对付反革命。群众路线是党的根本的政治路线和组织路线，这对于肃反斗争和人民公安机关来说，当然也是一个根本性质的问题。就是动员多数人来同反革命做斗争，还是只让少数人孤立地进行斗争的问题。在肃反斗争中，所以能够在较短时间内，扫清了大量反革命残余势力，而没有犯大的错误，就是因为我们党大胆放手地发动了群众，使肃反斗争既有了党的领导，又有了群众依靠。
    肃反斗争代表了人民的切身利益，反映了人民的正义要求，只要党表现了有彻底肃清反革命残余势力的决心，又有正确的领导，广大群众就一定敢于起来同反革命进行斗争。同时，任何反革命分子，都隐藏在群众当中，企图利用群众的不警惕，来进行破坏活动。只要发动了广大群众，特别是发动了处于中间状态和落后状态的群众，提高了他们的政治警惕和识别反革命分子的能力，就足以照亮任何阴暗的角落，使一切反革命分子都难于逃过群众的眼睛。七年来的肃反斗争，无数生动的事实，充分地说明了广大群众的政治觉悟和革命警惕性，是我们战胜一切反革命分子的力量中的最可宝贵的力量。
    但是，放手发动群众，绝不等于党对斗争放松领导，把党降低到普通群众的水平，做群众的尾巴。党是斗争的指挥者和组织者。同时，放手发动群众，绝不等于可以不要或者可以削弱专门机关的工作。专门机关既须依靠群众，也要带领群众，成为群众斗争的骨干。只有专门机关与广大群众相结合，才能够肃清大量的反革命残余势力，战胜任何狡猾的敌人。
    党为了领导群众和取得群众支持，首先就必须让群众知道肃反斗争的意义、目的、政策和办法。为此就必须广泛采取各种宣传方式，大张旗鼓地开展宣传工作，使肃反斗争的意义和党的政策深入人心，做到家喻户晓，人人明白。七年的斗争证明，当着党的正确方针和政策为群众所理解所掌握的时候，它就变成了巨大无比的物质力量。而且，掌握了政策的群众，一方面可以成为党的政策的积极执行者；另一方面，也可以监督人民公安机关和其他司法机关，正确地贯彻党的政策。
    为了要广泛地发动群众，就必须坚决地反对公安工作中的孤立主义和神秘主义。孤立主义、神秘主义是一种来自反动统治阶级的残余的影响，任何反动统治阶级都是压迫群众的，当然也是害怕群众、不要群众的。我们的人民公安机关是为人民的利益服务的，应该是而且历来是相信群众，依靠群众的。但是，我们也有些公安人员往往不适当地夸大了肃反斗争的一定的特殊性，忘记了群众。他们以为肃反斗争似乎只能由少数“专门家”来做，群众是无能为力的。这种观点，当然是错误的。
    孤立主义、神秘主义者往往用“保守秘密”作盾牌，不去实行群众路线。其实保守秘密与依靠群众是一致的。只要我们相信群众，依靠群众，群众觉悟提高了，就更有利于保守秘密。孤立主义、神秘主义者，总是装腔作势，鬼鬼祟祟，自以为很守秘密，其实不但不能保守秘密，反而引起群众怀疑，脱离群众。
    孤立主义、神秘主义者总是借口害怕群众“恐慌”，又害怕群众“过火”来拒绝实行群众路线。他们常常是畏首畏尾，小手小脚。结果，愈是不敢放手发动群众，就愈是容易引起群众的恐慌和怀疑；群众起来了，不敢去加以领导，就反而容易造成某些过火现象。只有坚决抛弃孤立主义、神秘主义，只有在党的领导下，坚持专门机关与广大群众相结合的群众路线，这些现象才可以完全避免。
    强调调查研究实事求是的作风
    第五，肃反斗争必须强调调查研究，实事求是。调查研究，是党决定政策，进行一切工作的基础。毛泽东同志反复教导我们，“没有调查就没有发言权”。这个真理，对任何工作来说都是重要的，对于肃反斗争尤其重要。因为肃反斗争的对象是隐蔽的敌人，要正确地判断每一个时期敌人活动的情况，做出恰当的估计，使肃反斗争的部署符合客观的实际情况，并把我们的一切措施建立在可靠的基础上面，真正做到心中有数，有的放矢，就必须更加强调调查研究工作。同时，如果我们没有调查研究工作，或者调查研究工作做得不好，那就不仅难以发现隐蔽得比较深的敌人，而且即使发现了，也难以获得真凭实据，弄清问题的性质，做出适当的处理。
    同调查研究、实事求是完全相反的是逼供信的方法。这就是只根据一些片面的、没有经过检验的材料，草率捕人。捕人以后，又往往轻信犯人口供，甚至用肉刑和变相肉刑逼供，相信逼出来的口供，再去捕人。这是主观主义的反马克思主义的方法，其结果，必然会把敌人的力量夸大化。我们党在第二次国内革命战争期间，在肃反斗争中曾经犯过这种错误，吃了一些亏，但是，却取得了一条经验，这就是必须实行充分的调查研究，坚决反对逼供信。
    反对逼供信，就必须绝对禁止肉刑和一切变相肉刑。我们党历来是严格禁止刑讯逼供的，因为刑讯逼供它只能促使我们犯错误，而无助于我们战胜敌人。我们的斗争是正义的，是为广大人民所支持的，我们没有任何必要采用这种野蛮的错误的办法。我们党历来强调重证据不轻信口供，证据还要经过反复检验，是真凭实据，而不是假证据。调查工作也要经过反复检查，反映问题要是全面的、合乎实际的，而不是主观片面的、偏听偏信的。这就是实事求是的科学态度。只有这样，我们才是真正有力量的。
    加强党的领导和群众的监督
    第六，为了保证肃反斗争的正确进行，对于人民公安机关，必须加强党的领导，加强党和群众的监督。人民公安机关是人民民主专政的一个重要工具，是党和国家反对内外敌人的锋利武器。这个武器掌握使用得好，可以打击敌人，保卫自己；掌握使用得不好，就会伤害自己，伤害人民。因此，必须十分强调党对人民公安机关的领导作用。
    我们党在这个问题上是有过教训的。在第二次国内革命战争的时候，曾经不正确地强调了保卫机关独立系统的垂直领导，这就使各级保卫机关失去了各级党委的领导和监督，因而犯了错误。从一九三五年遵义会议以后，党中央纠正了这个错误，坚持实行了对各级人民公安机关的正确领导制度，就是把各级公安机关置于党中央和各级党委的实际领导之下，军队的保卫机关，置于军队党委和政治机关的领导监督之下，在国家系统方面也是实行双重领导而不实行公安机关的垂直领导。在各级公安机关内部，实行党组集体领导和首长负责相结合的制度。这就使我们避免了重犯过去的错误。
    党中央关于加强对人民公安机关的领导和监督，对于公安机关的党组，曾经有过以下各项规定：公安工作中一切方针政策性的问题，一律要报请党中央讨论和批准。中央、省（市）委、地委和县委，对于公安工作除了经常性的讨论和检查外，每年应该专门讨论和系统检查两次，并作出相应的决定。不论任何工作，公安机关党组都不得借口工作特殊，向党保守秘密。重大问题必须事先请示，事后报告。否则，就是无组织无纪律的行为，就是向党闹独立性。人民公安机关是中央人民政府和各级人民政府的一个部门，是在中央人民政府和各级人民政府的领导和监督之下进行工作的。但是党对于公安机关的领导和监督，同政府对于公安机关的领导和监督，不仅不相矛盾，而且是一致的。公安工作的一切重要问题，应该提到政府讨论，并作出相应的决议、指示或颁布相应的命令。这样做，就可以切实地加强政府对公安工作的领导，有利于动员群众和组织人民民主统一战线内的各界人士积极参加肃反斗争，有利于人民群众和各界人士的监督。
    人民公安机关的一切活动，必须严格遵守宪法和法律的规定，同检察机关和法院建立分工负责、互相制约的正确制度，认真服从国家法律监督机关的监督。人民公安机关要通过各级人民代表大会，各种群众会议向人民报告工作，随时注意倾听群众的批评和建议，以取得广大群众的监督。人民代表大会代表对于肃反工作的视察，起了有力的监督作用，今后应该继续加强这一工作。人民公安机关内部还应该加强自上而下、自下而上的监督。
    以上这几个方面的监督发挥了作用，对于保证肃反斗争和公安工作的正确进行，有极为重要的意义。党的监督在这几个方面的监督中又是起决定作用的。
    上面列举的，就是党在领导全国人民所进行的肃反斗争中，已经取得的主要经验。这些经验，集中起来，就是：肃反斗争在党中央和各级党委领导之下，实行全党动员，群众动员，坚持严肃与谨慎相结合的方针，坚持“提高警惕，肃清一切特务分子；防止偏差，不要冤枉一个好人”的原则，实行惩办与宽大相结合的政策，坚持调查研究、实事求是的方法，严禁刑讯逼供，遵守革命法制。把所有这些结合起来，就是党在领导肃反斗争中的正确路线。
    大家知道，这一条系统的完整的肃反斗争的正确路线，是一九四三年延安整风审干时期，党的肃反斗争路线的发展。早在那个时候，党中央和毛泽东同志就曾经提出了著名的“九条方针”，这就是：首长负责，亲自动手，领导骨干与广大群众相结合，一般号召与个别指导相结合，调查研究反对逼供信，分清是非轻重，争取失足者，培养干部，教育群众。九条方针集中地总结了当时肃反斗争的群众创造，又充分地接受了党在遵义会议以前的历史时期内肃反斗争的经验，包括失败的经验和成功的经验在内。所以延安时期的九条方针，已经为我党领导肃反斗争建立了一条正确的路线。中华人民共和国成立以来，我党中央和毛泽东同志继续集中了肃反斗争的许多经验和创造，使得我们的这条路线，更加发展、更加完备了。可以肯定地说，我国肃反斗争的胜利，就是党的领导的胜利，就是党在肃反斗争中正确路线的胜利。
    我们工作中的缺点和错误
    但是，应当指出，我们公安机关在执行党的路线的实际工作中，曾经发生过一些缺点和错误，甚至有些缺点和错误是严重的。
    七年来的肃反斗争，我们曾经在一定时期内，在某些环节上，表现有左右摇摆的现象。在一九五○年十月以前的大半年中，全国公安机关对反革命分子的破坏活动，打击不力，曾经发生过“宽大无边”的右倾错误。一九五一年镇压反革命运动高潮的后期，由于领导控制不严和某些地方基层组织不纯，因而在若干地方发生过程度不同的粗糙草率的“左”的错误，捕了一些可捕可不捕的人，也杀了极少数可杀可不杀的反革命分子，甚至错捕了个别好人。在这一次镇压反革命运动结束以后，约在一九五四年春季到一九五五年春季一年左右的时间内，由于我们过高地估计了对反革命分子打击的程度，对国内反革命残余势力还有相当数量的事实估计不足，因而又曾在一个短期间放松了对残余反革命分子的打击，表现了认识落后于客观实际的右倾保守思想。在一九五五年下半年开始的肃反运动中，也发生了一些缺点和错误。在社会上捕了一些本来可以争取投案自首的反革命分子，甚至错捕了个别的好人。在机关内部，某些单位也有斗争面过宽的缺点，斗了少数不该斗的人。也还有些人过高估计了敌人分化瓦解的趋势，看不到还有反革命分子存在，产生了新的麻痹情绪。
    这些左右摇摆的现象，大多是发生在斗争形势转变的关头，说明我们掌握情况不够深入，贯彻执行中央的方针政策不够稳当。这些错误，就其性质来说是局部的、暂时的，是在执行党的正确路线的时候，在具体工作中发生的，由于中央和各级党委的密切领导，一般都及时地得到了纠正，有一些还正在检查纠正中。党中央最近决定：对于运动中错斗、错捕、错关、错判的人，必须认真进行检查，做好甄别、平反工作，切实加以妥善处理，绝不可因为是个别的、少数人的问题，就加以忽视。
    我们在执行党的政策的实际工作中，绝大多数公安机关和公安人员，都是忠实的积极的，坚持了党的政策，密切联系了广大人民群众。但是，也有少数公安机关和某些公安人员严重地存在着强迫命令、脱离群众的旧警察作风，曾经发生过违法乱纪破坏政策的错误，甚至发生过刑讯逼供的犯法行为，在群众中造成了十分恶劣的影响。前上海市公安局长杨帆，前广州市公安局副局长布鲁、陈坤，滥用职权，包庇特务，背着党和人民所进行的许多犯罪活动，给国家和人民造成了更大的损失。几年来，我们对于这种坏人坏事，曾经不断地开展了斗争，今后我们还必须继续同这些现象进行斗争。
    我们在遵守法制的问题上，也还存在着缺点。在逮捕拘留条例公布以后，有些地方捕人，还没有完全做到按照规定的时间向人民检察院办理批准逮捕的手续，有的在捕人后没有及时通知犯罪分子的家属。在对罪犯的管理中，还有偏重生产，忽视教育的缺点，甚至个别地方还有打骂犯人虐待犯人的错误。
    我们在侦察、警卫等项业务工作上，也还存在着某些形式主义、神秘主义的偏向，以致在有些地方造成了脱离群众的不良影响。
    这些缺点和错误，说明我们公安机关还存在着严重的主观主义、官僚主义的作风。同时，我们公安机关的某些干部还有极端危险的骄傲自满情绪。他们过高地估计了自己在肃反斗争中的成绩，忽视党和政府对自己的领导作用，忽视各有关部门在对敌斗争中密切配合互相帮助的作用，忽视广大群众的积极性和创造性。
    肃清反革命分子还是一个长期的斗争
    我们必须克服主观主义、官僚主义，加强工作检查，深入实际，接触群众。经常地开展批评与自我批评，谦虚谨慎，戒骄戒躁。提高马克思列宁主义的理论水平，提高公安人员的战斗能力。在今后斗争中更好地贯彻执行党的正确路线，争取斗争的胜利。
    同志们！现在我国阶级斗争的剧烈时期已成过去，但是，革命同反革命的斗争，还没有停止也不会停止，仍然还是一个长期的斗争。我们的敌人经过历次的打击，已经大大削弱了，反革命分子已经大大减少了，但是他们还没有被彻底肃清。无论在社会上或是机关内部，都还有残存的反革命分子，都还有少数坚决的反革命分子的破坏活动。北京市残余反革命分子王书田，今年六月二十九日行凶杀死工人孙瑞华；新疆奇台县医院的暗藏反革命分子庄世民，六月二十八日行凶砍死新疆林业厅副厅长刘殿英同志等三人，砍伤十一人，就是两个突出的事例。而且由于国内阶级还没有最后消灭，反革命还会有一定的社会基础和思想基础，即使阶级消灭了，他们也还会有一定的活动空隙。加以我国的领土台湾还没有解放，蒋介石集团的特务机关，还在不断地把特务间谍分子派入我国内地来，帝国主义的颠复活动，还在加紧地进行着。今年七月二十三日在福建省霞浦县破获偷渡登陆的台湾情报局“张振伦情报组”案，八月二日在浙江省温州地区破获偷渡登陆的蒋帮“括苍山行动队”案，以及今年五月十日在山东省海阳县破获的美帝国主义派遣特务案，就是证明。因此，我们对于反革命分子可能造成的危害，仍然必须提高警惕。
    今后，全国还有继续肃清社会上残余反革命分子（其中主要的是现行破坏的反革命分子）的任务，还有在机关内部肃清一切暗藏反革命分子的任务，还有很大的改造反革命分子的任务。我们必须按照刘少奇同志报告中所提示的对待反革命分子的新的方针和政策，很好地执行并完成这些任务，为保卫我国伟大的社会主义事业而奋斗。
