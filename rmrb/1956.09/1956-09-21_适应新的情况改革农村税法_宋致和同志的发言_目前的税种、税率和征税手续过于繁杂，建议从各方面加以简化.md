I fully agree with Chairman Mao's opening remarks and the reports of Comrades Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, and Deng Xiaoping, and I am willing to resolutely implement them in future work. Now I would like to offer some suggestions regarding rural industrial and commercial taxation.

The tax policies formulated by the state have played a positive role in the process of realizing the transformation of capitalist industry and commerce. Therefore, past tax policies were correct. However, in the current situation where the socialist economy has achieved an absolute advantage, and after agricultural cooperation, the management methods and distribution methods of farmers' sideline occupations and handicrafts have undergone fundamental changes, the tax exemption limits and collection methods for farmers' industrial and commercial taxes stipulated in the original tax law are no longer fully adapted to this new situation. This is mainly manifested in the fact that the tax categories, tax rates, and tax collection procedures are too complicated, which is not only difficult for farmers to understand and implement, but also difficult for tax officials to master, resulting in frequent occurrences of tax evasion, incorrect assessment, and coercive orders. Tax cadres reflect: "Little tax collected, much scolding received," while farmers say: "Tax on everything, who would actively engage in sideline occupations?" For example, from scrap steel to finished utensils, three different taxes have to be paid in three links, namely, a 10% commodity circulation tax is levied on smelting scrap into ingots, a 7% goods tax is levied on hammering ingots into sheets, and a 2.5% business tax is levied on making utensils from sheets. Secondly, some tax regulations are not reasonable enough. For example, this year's February notice from the Fifth Office of the State Council stipulates that farmers who sell more than 50 jin of grain in the national grain market will be taxed 3% of the total transaction amount as a grain goods tax, which has a certain adverse impact on attracting farmers' surplus grain to the market and organizing urban and rural grain adjustments. Also, the provision for farmers to pay stamp tax on family division is inappropriate, not only are the masses unaccustomed to it, but also the financial significance is not great.

Therefore, it is suggested that under the current circumstances, the current tax law should be reformed based on the principles of benefiting the development of production, promoting the diversified economy of agricultural production cooperatives, and embodying a correct distribution policy that takes into account the interests of the state, the collective, and the individual. The industrial and commercial taxes paid by agricultural production cooperatives for their handicrafts and various sideline productions should be simplified in terms of tax categories, tax rates, and tax payment procedures. All investment-distribution activities should not be taxed; all business-related activities should be taxed. The state should levy the industrial and commercial tax payable by agricultural production cooperatives according to their gross profit income from handicrafts and sideline occupations, using a comprehensive tax rate and implementing a fixed quota (i.e., contracted tax) method that remains unchanged for one year. After the implementation of such a tax system, increased production will not lead to increased taxes. This change in the tax system has three benefits: First, it encourages agricultural cooperatives to actively develop sideline occupations and handicraft production, thereby also opening up tax sources; second, after the contracted tax system is implemented, the tax authorities can be greatly reduced; and third, it is conducive to overcoming and preventing the coercive commanding style of tax cadres. In addition, in order to take care of disaster victims' self-reliance through production, handicraft and sideline production operated by severely affected societies (households) should be completely exempt from taxation, while those operated by lightly affected societies (households) should be taxed at half the rate (operations of a purely commercial nature will not be reduced or exempted). Finally, it is suggested that the tax measures for handicraft production cooperatives should also be considered in this spirit.

    适应新的情况改革农村税法
    宋致和同志的发言
    目前的税种、税率和征税手续过于繁杂，建议从各方面加以简化
    我完全同意毛主席的开幕词和刘少奇同志、周恩来同志、邓小平同志的报告，并且愿意在今后的工作中坚决贯彻执行。现在我就农村工商业税收方面提出一点建议。
    国家所制定的税收政策，在实现对资本主义工商业的改造过程中，发挥了积极的作用。因此，过去的税收政策是正确的。但是，在目前社会主义经济已经取得绝对优势的情况下，在农业合作化以后，农民的副业、手工业的经营方式和分配方法已经发生了根本变化之后，原来的税法中规定的对农民的工商业税征免界限和征收方法，已经不能完全适应这个新的情况。这主要表现在税种、税率和征税手续过于繁杂，不仅是农民不懂和不容易掌握执行，就是税收人员也难于掌握，因而常常出现漏税、错征以及强迫命令的现象。税收干部反映：“征税不多，挨骂不少”，农民则说：“一动就是税，谁还积极搞副业”。例如由废杂钢到制成器皿就得在三个环节上交纳三种不同的税款，即回炉熔炼成锭、块，征收百分之十的商品流通税，锭块捶成板片再征百分之七的货物税，由板片制成器皿再征百分之二点五的营业税。其次，某些税收的规定也不够合理。例如，今年二月国务院第五办公室的通知中规定，农民在国家粮食市场出售粮食超过五十斤者，按其交易总额征收百分之三的粮食货物税，这对于吸引农民的余粮上市和组织城乡粮食调剂有一定的不良影响。又如对农民分家单贴印花的规定也是不妥当的，不仅群众不习惯，而且财政意义也不大。
    因此，建议在目前的情况下，应本着有利于发展生产，促进农业生产合作社的多种经济的发展，体现正确的兼顾国家利益、集体利益和个人利益的分配政策，对现行税法加以改革。农业生产合作社所经营的手工业及各项副业生产，所交纳的工商业税，应一律简化税种、简化税率、简化纳税手续。凡属于投资分配性质的不应计税；凡属营业性质的，则一律计税。农业生产合作社应该交纳的工商业税，国家应按其手工业和副业的毛利收入，以综合税率，实行一年不变的定期定额（即包税）的征收办法。实行这样的税制以后，增产不增税。这样的一种税制的改变，有三个好处：一，鼓励农业合作社积极发展副业、手工业的生产，从而也开辟了税源；二，包税之后，可以大大减少税务机构；三，有利于克服与防止税收干部的强迫命令作风。此外，为了照顾灾民生产自救，对重灾社（户）经营的手工业和副业生产应全部免征，轻灾社（户）减半征收（属于纯商业性质的经营不予减免）。最后建议，对手工业生产合作社的税收办法，也应本此精神予以考虑。
