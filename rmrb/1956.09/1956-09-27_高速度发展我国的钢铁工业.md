Rapidly Develop China's Steel Industry
Speech by Wang Heshou, Director of the State Construction Commission and Minister of Metallurgical Industry

I fully agree with Comrade Mao Zedong's opening speech, the Party Central Committee's political report, the report on amending the Party Constitution, and the report on the proposal for the Second Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy.

In order to build our country into a powerful socialist nation, we need to greatly increase productivity, comprehensively develop the national economy, and transform our country from a backward agricultural country into an advanced industrial country. In the process of industrialization, the development of the steel industry is an important issue. Now I would like to express some opinions on this issue.

The development speed of China's steel industry exceeds that of capitalist countries, but arduous efforts are still needed to catch up with and surpass their production levels.

The history of industrial development proves that the steel industry is the foundation of overall industrial development. The speed of industrial development depends, to a large extent, on the speed of the steel industry's development. The amount of steel production is a major indicator of a country's industrial level. During the First Five-Year Plan, our Party adopted the policy of "concentrating more financial and human resources to build the steel industry, in order to establish the foundation of our country's industrialization in a shorter period of time," and in the Second Five-Year Plan, we continue to adopt the policy of vigorously developing the steel industry. It is precisely because of our Party's correct policy that the development speed of China's steel has been quite fast in the past few years, and will continue to maintain a high speed of development in the future. The First Five-Year Plan stipulates that China's steel production should increase from 1.349 million tons in 1952 to 4.12 million tons in 1957, with an average annual increase of 25 percent. As a result of implementation, it is estimated that it can reach 5.5 million tons in 1957, with an average annual increase of 32.5 percent. In the Party Central Committee's proposal for the Second Five-Year Plan, it is proposed that China's steel production level reach 10.5 million to 12 million tons by 1962. Calculated at 12 million tons, the average annual increase is 16.8 percent, and the average annual increase for ten years is 24.4 percent. This speed will greatly exceed the development speed of the steel industry in capitalist countries.

Now, let me use some figures to illustrate this issue: The most developed capitalist country, the United States, produced 1.25 million tons of steel in 1880 (close to China's level in 1952). It took a total of 75 years, until 1955, to produce 106.17 million tons, with an average annual growth rate of 6.1 percent. The oldest capitalist country, Britain, increased its steel production from 1.38 million tons to 20.11 million tons in the 75 years from 1880 to 1955, with an average annual growth rate of 3.6 percent. The rising capitalist country, Germany, increased its steel production from 660,000 tons to 21.34 million tons in 75 years, with an average annual growth rate of 4.7 percent. Moreover, even in the earlier period (before 1900), if calculated on a ten-year average, their annual growth rate was also below 13 percent. It can be seen from this that the development speed of the steel industry in capitalist countries is generally slow.

However, we cannot only see the slow development speed of the steel industry in capitalist countries. We should also see the other side, that is, the development of the steel industry in capitalist countries is not always in a state of low speed. When they urgently need steel or when producing steel has great profits, the development speed of their steel industry may be relatively fast, or even very fast, within a short period of time. The United States once increased by an average of 17 percent per year in the five years from 1900 to 1905. Britain increased by an average of 19.7 percent per year in the five years from 1932 to 1937. Especially after the Second World War, the recovery of the steel industry in capitalist countries was relatively fast. In some countries (such as West Germany, Italy, Japan, France, Belgium, etc.), the average annual growth rate in the ten years from 1946 to 1955 exceeded 10 percent, some exceeded 15 percent, and some even exceeded 20 percent. From the investment in capital construction in the steel industry in capitalist countries, it can also be seen that they pay close attention to the development of their steel industry. According to data from the American Iron and Steel Institute, the United States invested 7 billion U.S. dollars in the steel industry after World War II, and plans to invest another 3 to 4.5 billion U.S. dollars in the next three years. This year, U.S. steel companies are investing 1.2 billion U.S. dollars in the steel industry. In France and West Germany, the funds invested in the steel industry in recent years have also averaged 200-300 million U.S. dollars per year. Although the capitalist system itself inevitably causes constant industrial fluctuations and various forms of economic crisis, making it impossible for them to maintain this high-speed development for a long time, even short-term high-speed or relatively high-speed development is worthy of our attention. We cannot only have a general concept that the development speed of the steel industry and even the entire industry in capitalist countries must be slower than ours, and therefore think that we do not need to go through any arduous efforts and will naturally catch up with or surpass capitalist countries. On the contrary, we should not relax the development speed of our steel industry in the slightest. Only by consistently maintaining the development speed of our country's steel industry higher than that of capitalist countries can it be possible to catch up with the major capitalist countries in this respect after a certain period of time. Therefore, it is very important for our Party to vigorously develop the steel industry so that it can have a high speed of development. Judging from the development speed stipulated in the First and Second Five-Year Plans, it is entirely possible for us to maintain a higher development speed than the steel industry in capitalist countries.

High-speed development of the steel industry is necessary for our country to build a strong socialist country.

In the process of peaceful competition, making our country's steel production level catch up with the steel production level of major capitalist countries has great political significance. We can use this fact to illustrate that only under the superior socialist system is it possible for a country with a very backward steel industry to reach the level reached by their steel industry in a much shorter time than required by capitalist countries. Therefore, starting from the task of catching up with the steel production level of major capitalist countries in the peaceful competition, it is necessary to maintain the high-speed development of our steel industry. However, this is only one aspect. The main aspect is to maintain the high-speed development of our steel industry from the needs of building our country into a strong socialist country. Our country is the most populous country in the world. To carry out socialist industrialization in a large country with 600 million people, and to build an industrialized country with a complete industrial system, it is necessary to have sufficient steel. Because the amount of steel needed for our country's large-scale capital construction is very large. 100 million yuan of construction and installation work requires an average of 22,000 to 25,000 tons of steel; 1,000 kilometers of railway requires 180,000 to 190,000 tons of steel rails and steel. To build a strong machinery manufacturing industry, we must also have sufficient raw materials, first of all, steel. According to actual data from the past few years, the machinery industry needs an average of about 15,000 tons of steel for every 100 million yuan increase in its total output value. Therefore, the Party Central Committee's proposal on the Second Five-Year Plan pointed out that special attention should be paid to the construction of the machinery manufacturing industry and the metallurgical industry. This is completely correct.

With the expansion of industrial production and the scale of capital construction, the quantity and variety of steel needed every year are huge and numerous. We must ensure that these needs are met in order for our country's industry to develop smoothly. Can we rely on importing steel from abroad to develop our country's industry? This road is unworkable. Not only would it be unreliable to build a strong industry mainly by importing steel from abroad, but it is impossible to import a large amount of steel itself. This can be proven by the following facts: In 1955, the United States produced more than 106 million tons of steel, 95 percent of which was consumed domestically, and only 5 percent of steel was exported (excluding machinery exports); Britain produced 20 million tons of steel, only about 10 percent of which was exported, and mainly to British territories, countries ruled by British capital, and countries with preferential treatment for British oil exploration; West Germany also exported a small amount of steel; only France, Belgium and Luxembourg exported more steel. Looking at the socialist camp: In 1955, the socialist countries produced a total of more than 60 million tons of steel, of which the Soviet Union produced 45 million tons. But whether it is the Soviet Union or other fraternal countries, they all feel that steel is in short supply. It can be seen from this that it is fundamentally impossible to rely on importing a large amount of steel from abroad to solve the needs of our country's industrialization. At the same time, our country is a member of the socialist family. In order to make the entire socialist camp more prosperous, and in order for the socialist camp to have more metal, we must also firmly implement the central government's policy of vigorously developing the steel industry and rapidly improve the production level of our steel industry.

Our country has sufficient conditions to maintain the high-speed development of the steel industry.

Does our country have the specific conditions to maintain the high-speed development of the steel industry? We have these conditions completely.

First, our country is a large country with a large population. A large population means more labor and more technical personnel can be trained. This will ensure that the construction and production of the steel industry can obtain sufficient labor and technical strength, allowing us to carry out many huge construction projects simultaneously, and ensuring that industrial production can continuously obtain reserve forces. At the same time, a large population means a broad market, which will greatly promote the development speed of our country's industry, thereby also promoting the development speed of the steel industry.

Second, our country's resources are very abundant. Recent preliminary explorations have proven that not only are iron resources abundant, but other metals related to the development of the steel industry, such as copper, lead, zinc, tungsten, tin, molybdenum, and various rare metals, are also quite abundant. At the same time, our country's fuel and hydropower resources are also abundant. These resources are sufficient to meet the needs of developing our country's steel industry, providing extremely favorable conditions for the high-speed development of our country's steel industry.

Third, our construction began in an era of new technology. Many new scientific achievements have been applied to the construction and production of the steel industry. In this way, we can build more factories in the same amount of time than in the past; the factories built with the same amount of funds and the same amount of equipment will produce much more than in the past. Taking blast furnaces as an example, based on the technical indicators we have currently achieved, the output of a blast furnace of the same volume is now more than twice that of the output more than 20 years ago.

Fourth, can we solve the required funds if we adopt a high-speed development of the steel industry? Yes, the funds required for the development of the steel industry are very large. A relatively large steel enterprise requires an investment of about 1.5 billion yuan, plus the construction costs of water, electricity, and transportation, the amount of investment will increase. Heavy industry not only requires large investments in construction, but it may also require state subsidies in the early stages of its production. Therefore, the development of the steel industry must take into account the country's financial strength. However, judging from our country's specific situation, the steel industry not only does not need subsidies in production, but also plays a considerable role in accumulating funds in the process of its production and development. This feature tells us that the high-speed development of the steel industry will not bring about serious financial difficulties as imagined. Moreover, the rapid development of the steel industry may increase accumulation for the country in all aspects and promote the development of the entire national economy.

Fifth, the international environment in which our country is located is much more favorable than when the Soviet Union began construction after the October Revolution. The Soviet Union was surrounded by imperialism at that time and could not obtain economic and technical assistance from other countries. Now the situation in the world is different. The Soviet Union has been built into a prosperous socialist country, and many people's democratic countries are also successfully developing their own industries. Therefore, the development of our steel industry, like other industries, can obtain and has obtained huge international assistance. This has a significant impact on our high-speed development of the steel industry.

Sixth, in the past few years, under the care and correct policy guidance of the Party, and with the help of experts from the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries, we have initially gathered and cultivated a construction team capable of carrying out large-scale construction, and gathered and cultivated a design force, which guarantees that we can carry out the construction of many major projects simultaneously.

Improve our work in leadership, organization, production and capital construction to ensure the high-speed development of the steel industry.

The conditions for the high-speed development of China's steel industry are fully available; the key is how to fully utilize these conditions through correct leadership and effective organizational work. We have many mistakes and shortcomings in this regard. For example, in production, in the past few years, the utilization rate of blast furnaces has increased, but we have neither expanded the production of ore, coking, and refractory materials in a timely manner, nor have we expanded the capacity of auxiliary departments in a timely manner. This has resulted in insufficient supply of iron ore, coke, and refractory materials; imbalances in water, electricity, gas, and transportation, which has hindered the more rapid improvement of blast furnace production. The utilization rate of open-hearth steelmaking furnaces has increased rapidly, but the ironmaking in front of it cannot keep up, and the steel rolling behind it cannot keep up, which has also hindered the more rapid improvement of steelmaking capacity. In capital construction, we also often lack comprehensive research and comprehensive balance, resulting in the inability of various links to connect, thereby prolonging the construction time, etc. If we had done better in leadership, the production of steel could have been higher.

We also have many other errors and shortcomings in production and capital construction. One of them is the error of unilaterally emphasizing the "one-chief system" in enterprise management. I used to unilaterally emphasize the "one-chief system." The nature of this error mainly lies in: ideologically neglecting the leading role of the Party in the enterprise; neglecting political work and the mass line in the work line; and as a result, it is easy to form bureaucracy that does not understand the situation and is divorced from the masses. From my personal point of view, the reasons for this error are mainly due to individualism and complacency. The nature of socialist enterprises is public ownership. Our main principle of managing enterprises should be: relying on the leadership of the Party in the enterprise, working together with the trade union, and constantly improving the consciousness of the masses, so that all employees consciously participate in enterprise management as masters; relying on the leadership and supervision of the Party in the enterprise to improve the efficiency of administrative work. Only when the masses care more about the enterprise can the potential of the enterprise be brought into greater play; only when all major issues have been collectively discussed by the Party committee can administrative work avoid or make fewer mistakes, thereby improving the efficiency of administrative work. Therefore, production and administrative work in the enterprise, including administrative orders, must be built on the basis of collective leadership and full political work. Improperly emphasizing administrative power or the power of the factory director will inevitably gradually foster a dictatorial style in the enterprise, foster bureaucracy of purely administrative orders, and bind the creativity of the masses. In the past few years, the Ministry of Heavy Industry has replaced and transferred some factory directors who ignored the leadership of the Party and were divorced from the masses. I don't think these factory directors were originally bad. The main mistake was not in them, but in the leadership. Because emphasizing this incorrect method of enterprise management made it easy for them to embark on an incorrect path. Therefore, I should first review myself in this matter. It was precisely because I was educated by this fact that I was able to correct my erroneous views when the Party Central Committee proposed to correct this error.

Now, factories, mines and capital construction units in the metallurgical sector are correcting the mistakes of enterprise administrative cadres who ignore the leadership of the Party and ignore political work, in accordance with the instructions of the Party Central Committee. It is hoped that the Party committees in various places will strengthen ideological education and leadership for administrative cadres in the metallurgical sector, and help us correct our shortcomings and errors. I believe that under the correct leadership of the Party and through everyone's efforts, our country's steel industry will definitely develop rapidly.

    高速度发展我国的钢铁工业
    国家建设委员会主任兼冶金工业部部长　王鹤寿同志的发言
    我完全同意毛泽东同志的开幕词和党中央的政治报告、修改党的章程的报告、发展国民经济的第二个五年计划的建议的报告。
    为了把我国建成一个强大的社会主义国家，我们需要大大提高生产力，全面发展国民经济，使我国从落后的农业国变成先进的工业国。在工业化的过程中，钢铁工业的发展是一个重要问题。现在我想就这个问题发表一些意见。
    我国钢铁工业发展的速度超过资本主义国家，但要赶上和超过它们的生产水平，还需要进行艰巨的努力
    工业发展的历史证明，钢铁工业是整个工业发展的基础。工业发展的速度，主要条件之一是取决于钢铁工业的发展速度。钢铁生产量的多寡，是衡量国家工业水平高低的一个主要标志。我们党在第一个五年计划期中，采取了“集中较大的财力和人力来建设钢铁工业，以求能够用较短的时间建立起我国工业化的基础”的方针，在第二个五年计划中，仍然采取大力发展钢铁工业的方针。正是由于我们党的这一正确方针，我国钢铁的发展速度，在过去几年是相当快的，而且在今后仍将保持高速度的发展。第一个五年计划中规定，我国钢的产量要从一九五二年的一三四·九万吨，提高到一九五七年的四一二万吨，每年平均增长百分之二十五；执行的结果，到一九五七年预计可以达到五五○万吨，每年平均增长百分之三十二·五。在党中央对第二个五年计划的建议中，提出一九六二年我国钢的生产水平达到一、○五○——一、二○○万吨，以一、二○○万吨计算，平均每年增长百分之一六·八，十年合计平均每年增长百分之二十四·四。这个速度将大大超过资本主义国家钢铁工业发展的速度。
    现在用一些数字来说明这个问题：资本主义最发达的美国，在一八八○年就生产了一二五万吨钢（与我国一九五二年水平相近），直到一九五五年一共用了七十五年的时间，生产到一○、六一七万吨，平均每年增长速度是百分之六·一。最老的资本主义国家英国，从一八八○年到一九五五年的七十五年中，钢的产量从一三八万吨增加到二、○一一万吨，平均每年增长百分之三·六。后起的资本主义的德国，在七十五年中钢的产量从六十六万吨提高到二、一三四万吨，平均每年增长百分之四·七。而且就是在比较早的时期（一九○○年以前），如果以十年平均计算的话，它们每年的增长速度也都在百分之十三以下。从这里可以看出，资本主义国家钢铁工业发展的速度，在总的方面是慢的。
    但是，我们不能只看到资本主义国家钢铁工业发展速度慢这一个方面，我们还应该看到另一方面，这就是资本主义国家钢铁工业的发展，并不是经常处于低速度的状态，在他们急需钢铁或生产钢铁有很大利润的时候，他们钢铁工业发展的速度在一个短的时期内，也可能是比较快的，甚至是很快的。美国就曾在一九○○——一九○五年的五年中，平均每年增长百分之十七。而英国在一九三二——一九三七年的五年中，平均每年增长百分之十九·七。特别是在第二次世界大战以后，资本主义国家钢铁工业的恢复是比较快的，有些国家（如西德、意大利、日本、法国、比利时等）在一九四六——一九五五年的十年中，每年平均上升速度有的超过百分之十，有的超过百分之十五，有的甚至超过百分之二十。从资本主义国家中对钢铁工业的基本建设投资上也可以看出它们很注意发展自己的钢铁工业。根据美国钢铁协会的资料，美国在第二次世界大战以后，向钢铁工业投资了七十亿美元，在今后三年它还准备投资三十——四十五亿美元，今年美国各个钢铁企业投资于钢铁工业的是十二亿美元。在法国和西德最近几年投资于钢铁工业的资金，平均每年也在二——三亿美元。虽然由于资本主义制度本身不可避免地经常造成工业上的波动和各种形式的经济危机，使他们不可能长期保持这种高速度的发展，但即使短时期的高速度或较高速度的发展，也是值得我们注意的。我们不能只有一个笼统的概念，认为资本主义国家的钢铁工业以至整个工业的发展速度一定慢于我们，因而认为我们不需经过什么艰巨的努力，自然会赶上或超过资本主义国家。相反，丝毫也不应该放松我们钢铁工业的发展速度。而且只有经常保持我国钢铁工业的发展速度高于资本主义国家的发展速度，才有可能经过一定时期在这方面赶上主要的资本主义国家。因此，我们党以大力发展钢铁工业，使它能够有高速度的发展，是十分重要的。从第一个和第二个五年计划规定的发展速度来看，我们保持高于资本主义国家钢铁工业发展速度是完全可能的。
    钢铁工业高速度发展，是我国建成强大的社会主义国家所必需
    在和平竞赛的过程中，使我国钢铁的生产水平赶上主要资本主义国家的钢铁生产水平，是有很大政治意义的。我们可以用这个事实来说明，只有在社会主义优越的制度下，才有可能使一个钢铁工业十分落后的国家，用大大短于资本主义国家所需要的时间，达到它们钢铁工业所达到的水平。因此，从在和平竞赛中赶上主要资本主义国家的钢铁生产水平这个任务出发，必须保持我国钢铁工业高速度的发展。但是，这只是一个方面。主要的一个方面，则是从建设我国成为一个强大的社会主义国家的需要出发。更必须保持我国钢铁工业高速度的发展。我国是世界上人口最多的国家，在一个六亿人口的大国里，进行社会主义工业化的建设，而且要建设一个有完整工业体系的工业化国家，就必须要有足够的钢铁。因为我国大规模的基本建设，需要的钢材数量是很大的。一亿元的建筑安装工作量平均需要钢材二·二——二·五万吨；一千公里铁路需要钢轨和钢材十八——十九万吨。我们要建设强大的机械制造工业，也必须要有足够的原料，首先是钢铁。根据过去几年来的实际资料，机械工业每提高一亿元的生产总值，平均需要钢材约一·五万吨左右。因此，党中央关于第二个五年计划的建议中，指出应该特别注意机械制造工业和冶金工业的建设。这是完全正确的。
    随着工业生产和基本建设规模的扩大，每年需要的钢铁数量、种类是庞大和繁多的，必须保证满足这种需要，才能使我国工业顺利发展，我们是否可以依靠从国外进口钢材来发展我国的工业呢？这条道路是行不通的。不仅主要依靠从国外进口钢材就没有把握建设起强大的工业，而且大量进口钢材这件事本身就是不可能的。这一点可以用以下的事实来证明：一九五五年美国生产了一亿零六百多万吨钢，国内消费了百分之九十五，仅有百分之五的钢材出口（不包括机器的出口）；英国生产了二千万吨钢，出口的只有百分之十左右，而且主要是输往英属地、英国资本统治的国家以及英国享有优惠待遇的石油开采国家；西德输出钢材的数量也不多；只有法国、比利时和卢森堡，才输出较多的钢材。再看社会主义阵营：一九五五年社会主义各国总共生产了六千多万吨钢，其中苏联生产了四、五○○万吨。但不管苏联也好，其他兄弟国家也好，都感到钢铁不敷需要。由此可见，要想依靠从国外进口大量钢铁，来解决我国工业化的需要，是根本不可能的。同时，我国是社会主义大家庭中的一员，为了使整个社会主义阵营更加繁荣，为了使社会主义阵营拥有更多的金属，我们也必须坚决地执行中央所提出的大力发展钢铁工业的方针，迅速提高我国钢铁工业的生产水平。
    我国有保持钢铁工业高速度发展的充分条件
    我国有没有保持钢铁工业高速度发展的具体条件呢？完全有这种条件。
    首先，我国是人口众多的大国。人口多，劳动力就多，可以培养出来的技术人员也就多。从而，就可以保证钢铁工业的建设和生产得到充足的劳动力和技术力量，使我们有可能同时进行许多巨大的建设工程；就可以保证工业生产源源不断地得到后备力量。同时，人口众多，市场就广阔，这就必将大大促进我国工业的发展速度，从而也促进钢铁工业的发展速度。
    第二，我国的资源十分丰富。最近几年初步勘探证明，不但铁的资源丰富，其他和发展钢铁工业有关的金属如铜、铅、锌、钨、锡、钼以及各种稀有金属，也都相当丰富。同时，我国的燃料和水力资源，也是丰富的，这些资源足以满足发展我国钢铁工业的需要，为高速度发展我国钢铁工业提供了极有利的条件。
    第三，我们的建设开始于一个新技术的时代，许多新的科学成就已运用到钢铁工业的建设和生产上。这样，我们用同样的时间，可以比过去建设起更多的工厂；用同等的资金、同等数量的设备所建设起来的工厂，所得到的产量要比过去大得多。以高炉为例，就以我们目前所达到的技术指标来说，同样容积的一座高炉，现在的产量就等于二十多年以前的产量两倍以上。
    第四，我们采取高速度发展钢铁工业，是否能解决所需要的资金呢？是的，钢铁工业的发展，所需要的资金是很大的。一个比较大的钢铁企业约需投资十五亿元左右，加上水、电、交通等建设费用，投资的数量还要加大。重工业不仅在建设上需要的投资大，而且通常在它生产的初期，还可能需要国家贴补。因此，钢铁工业的发展，必须考虑到国家的财政力量。但从我国的具体情况来看，钢铁工业在生产上不但不需要贴补，而且在它的生产发展过程中，还起了相当大的积累资金的作用。这一特点告诉我们，钢铁工业高速度的发展，不是如想像那样会带来严重的资金困难。而且钢铁工业的迅速发展还可能为国家从各方面增加积累，促进整个国民经济的发展。
    第五，我国所处的国际环境，比苏联十月革命后开始建设时也有利得多。苏联当时在帝国主义包围下，得不到其他国家经济和技术的援助。现在世界的形势不同了，苏联已经建成一个繁荣的社会主义国家，许多人民民主国家，也都在胜利地发展自己的工业。因此，我们的钢铁工业的发展，像其他工业一样，可以得到而且已经得到巨大的国际援助。这对我们高速度发展钢铁工业有重大的作用。
    第六，几年来，我们在党的关怀和正确的政策指导下，在苏联和其他兄弟国家的专家帮助下，我们已经初步的集结、培养出一支能够进行大规模建设的建筑队伍，集结、培养出一支设计力量，这就保证了我们可以同时进行许多重大工程的建设。
    从领导、组织、生产和基本建设方面改进我们的工作，保证钢铁工业高速度的发展
    高速度发展我国钢铁工业的条件，是完全具备的；问题的关键在于如何通过正确的领导，进行有效的组织工作，来充分利用这些条件。在这方面我们是有很多错误和缺点的。例如在生产上，几年来，高炉的利用率提高了，但是我们既没有及时地相应地扩大矿石、炼焦、耐火材料的生产，又没有及时地相应地扩大辅助部门的能力，这样就发生了铁矿、焦炭和耐火材料的供应不足；发生了水、电、煤气、交通运输的不平衡，这就妨碍了高炉生产更迅速地提高。炼钢平炉的利用率提高的很快，但是它前面的炼铁跟不上，后面的轧钢跟不上，这也就妨碍了炼钢能力更迅速地提高。在基本建设上，我们也常常由于缺乏综合的研究与综合的平衡，而发生各个环节不能衔接，从而拖长了建设时间等等。如果我们在领导上做得好一些的话，钢铁的生产量是可能更高些的。
    我们在生产工作上和基本建设工作上，还有其他方面的许多错误缺点。其中之一是在企业管理上片面强调一长制的错误。我过去就是片面强调一长制的。这一错误的性质，主要的在于：在思想上忽视了企业中党的领导作用；在工作路线上忽视了政治工作和群众路线；最后的结果，就很容易形成不了解情况、脱离群众的官僚主义。从我个人来检查发生这一错误的原因，主要是由于个人主义和骄傲自满。社会主义企业的性质是全民的，我们管理企业的主要原则应该是：依靠企业中党的领导，和工会共同努力，不断地提高群众的觉悟，使全体职工以主人翁的自觉共同参预企业管理；依靠企业中党的领导和监督，以提高行政工作的效率。只有群众更多地关心企业，才能更大地发挥企业的潜力；只有在一切重大问题上经过党委的集体讨论，才能使行政工作不犯错误或少犯错误，从而提高行政工作的效率。因此企业中的生产行政工作，包括行政命令在内，必须建筑在集体领导和充分的政治工作的基础上。不适当地强调行政权力或厂长权力，必然会逐渐在企业中养成独断专行的作风，养成单纯行政命令的官僚主义，束缚群众的创造性。几年来重工业部曾经撤换了和调换了一些忽视党的领导、脱离群众的厂长，我认为并不是这些厂长原来都不好，主要的错误不在他们，而在于领导。因为强调了这种不正确的企业管理方法，就使他们容易走向不正确的道路，因此在这件事情上，我是首先应该检讨的。正是受到了这种事实教育，因而在党中央提出纠正这一错误时，我才能够改正自己的错误观点。
    现在，冶金部门的厂矿和基本建设单位，正在根据党中央的指示纠正企业行政干部忽视党的领导、忽视政治工作的错误。希望各地党委加强对冶金部门行政干部的思想教育和领导，帮助我们改正缺点和错误。我相信在党的正确领导下，经过大家的努力，我国的钢铁工业是一定能够迅速发展起来的。
