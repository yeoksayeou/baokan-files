Comrades of Guangdong Province fully support Comrade Mao Zedong's opening speech, Comrade Liu Shaoqi's political report on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Comrade Zhou Enlai's report on the proposal for the Second Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy, and Comrade Deng Xiaoping's report on the revision of the Party Constitution. Now, I will make a speech on several issues of agricultural production in Guangdong:

During the nation's First Five-Year Plan, Guangdong Province, according to the instructions of the Central Committee, determined the working policy of focusing on agriculture. After four years of implementation, it has achieved results. With the rapid development of national economic construction, especially industrial construction, Guangdong's industrial construction will also have great development. This requires us to use greater strength and a more active attitude to carry out industrial production and construction. However, in the next few years, Guangdong Province will continue to adopt the working policy of focusing on agriculture, and strive to implement this policy more comprehensively and effectively, in order to support national industrialization and improve the lives of the people in the province.

At the beginning of the First Five-Year Plan, that is, in 1953, there were different opinions inside and outside the Party in Guangdong Province on the implementation of the policy of focusing on agriculture. This was mainly due to not proceeding from the specific situation and not understanding the relationship between agriculture and industry, especially the relationship with light industry.

Preparing Conditions for Developing Industry, Mainly Light Industry

Implementing the working policy of focusing on agriculture does not mean neglecting industry, let alone not developing industry in Guangdong. It is only because at that time, the land reform in the province had just ended, agricultural production in most areas was in a backward state, the food problem was also very tense, and the economic crops, which are raw materials for the development of light industry, were in urgent need of restoration and development; at the same time, underground resources were completely unclear, and the state once determined that no industry should be built in the coastal areas. The problem facing the people of the province at that time was: should we focus on developing industry like the major industrial areas in the country, or should we first concentrate our efforts on doing a good job in agriculture, so as to practically create conditions for the development of industry in Guangdong, and be able to truly and rapidly shift to focusing on industry? There is no doubt that Guangdong Province should focus on agriculture as a working policy for a period of time. The facts of the past four years have shown that this should be considered correct, whether from the current interests of the people of Guangdong or from the long-term interests of the country, that is, with a view to making greater support for national industrial construction. Even today, when the Central Committee has determined that Guangdong must also actively carry out some industrial construction, our policy of focusing on agriculture will not only not affect the active progress of Guangdong's industrial construction in the future; on the contrary, it will further promote the development of food production, especially the production of economic crops as industrial raw materials, and prepare better conditions for vigorously developing Guangdong's industry. Because from the perspective of Guangdong's special subtropical geographical conditions and its position as the front line of national defense, the main thing should be to develop light industry; and to develop light industry, if we do not first develop agriculture, especially the development of economic crops as raw materials for light industry, that is impossible.

Guangdong Province can be said to be "Blessed by Nature" for Developing Agricultural Production

In Guangdong, the conditions for developing agricultural production can be said to be "blessed by nature." The province has a warm climate, most areas have no frost period throughout the year, the average temperature is nineteen to twenty-six degrees (the average temperature in winter and spring is about seventeen degrees), and the rainfall is abundant, with an average annual rainfall of about one thousand six hundred millimeters. In addition, most areas have relatively sufficient labor, and many women have the habit of participating in major agricultural labor, so there is a huge potential for developing agricultural production. The problem now is: how to further fully and rationally use these favorable conditions, how to quickly tap the huge potential that is contained, so that Guangdong's agricultural production can be developed more rapidly. According to several years of exploration, we believe that the most important issues are: first, adapt to the characteristics of the subtropical region, and develop more economic crops according to local conditions, so that the land can be used to its full advantage. Second, adapt to the characteristic of no frost period throughout the year and the ability of crops to grow in all four seasons, increase the multiple cropping index, and gradually achieve three crops a year, so as to make full use of the land.

With the Realization of Agricultural Cooperativization, it is Possible to Well Tap the Production Potential

To fully realize the above requirements, of course, agriculture needs to be equipped with machinery, but we must never passively wait until agricultural machinery is well equipped before taking action. Today, with the realization of agricultural cooperativization, it is possible to tap the production potential very well. Last year, the province suffered very serious natural disasters, and the Chaoshan area still saw three "grain thousand-jin counties" with an average annual yield of one thousand jin per mu; although various natural disasters of varying degrees occurred again this year, the plan to increase production by 13 percent can still be completed with certainty. These are all proofs of the great potential of agricultural production. After the end of the land reform, we relied on the enthusiasm for production that emerged from individual farmers after the land reform, and agricultural production improved somewhat, but the strength of the individual small-scale farming economy was ultimately limited and very unstable. It was impossible to greatly increase labor productivity, impossible to carry out slightly major agricultural technical reforms and expanded reproduction, and helpless in the face of major natural disasters. Therefore, before cooperativization, the potential of agricultural production in Guangdong was still very limited. After cooperativization, the situation is very different. For example, in the implementation of increasing the multiple cropping area, the so-called three crops a year, and the technical reform of close planting of rice, before cooperativization, although it was constantly advocated, the winter planting area increased by a total of only 10 million mu in six years; but in the first year of cooperativization, that is, last winter, the winter planting area expanded by 4.5 million mu. Another example is the change from single cropping to double cropping (including the change from two-season intercropping to two-season continuous cropping). Last winter, 4 million mu were changed, while very little had been changed in the previous six years. In 1955, less than 20 percent of the rice fields in the province were closely planted, but this year, the early season reached 75 percent.

Why was the multiple cropping area expanded so much this year, but so little in the past six years? Why is the promotion of close planting of rice so fast this year, but so slow in the past six years? The reason is very simple. Expanding the multiple cropping area and promoting close planting require a lot of labor, and require the two conditions of water conservancy and fertilizer. To build a large number of water conservancy projects and accumulate a large amount of fertilizer requires even more labor, which is impossible for scattered individual farmers, and can only be done after cooperativization. It can be seen that the superiority of cooperativization is first manifested in the great increase in labor efficiency, which is precisely the decisive condition for tapping the potential of agricultural production before agricultural mechanization. However, what still needs to be brought to our attention is that we must have sufficient estimates of the difficulties of agricultural production at any time. If we do not see the difficulties existing in China's agricultural production today, and actively try to overcome them, but think that after cooperativization, from now on, God will change rain into rice, set very high targets, and blindly be optimistic, that is undoubtedly wrong. In the past, the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee made a blindly optimistic mistake in its understanding of the potential of agricultural production. When agricultural production is in a smooth situation, this kind of blindly optimistic thinking may still raise its head in the future, and it is still worth our attention.

On the Basis of Ensuring Increased Grain Production, Actively and Greatly Develop Economic Crops

It is very necessary to make full use of Guangdong's unique natural conditions and actively and greatly develop economic crops. In the past few years, we have also put forward the policy of giving priority to grain in agricultural production, and at the same time actively developing economic crops according to local conditions. However, after the whole country entered socialist planned construction, the grain problem has always been the most acute and tense problem, forcing us to concentrate our efforts on solving the problem of grain production. In the past few years, grain production has indeed increased. Although there were serious natural disasters in 1955, the province's grain harvest still reached the total output of 22 billion jin in 1954. If the plan to increase production can be completed this year, the total grain output can reach 25 billion jin. In addition, the Central Committee has exempted Guangdong from the task of transferring grain out this year, so after the summer harvest, the grain situation in the province has greatly eased compared to the past. Farmers generally retain more food grain than last year, and some cooperatives in areas with more increased production have also retained enough feed grain in addition to retaining enough food grain and completing the purchase and levy of grain. With the easing of the grain situation, many agricultural cooperatives have begun to expand the production of economic crops and develop animal husbandry. However, it should be pointed out that we have not paid enough attention to the development of economic crops in the past. Except for a few relatively concentrated and major crops, such as sugar cane, jute, ramie, and peanuts, which have had considerable development, others have not been given due development. Many scattered and sporadic economic crops, which add up to a considerable quantity, have shrunk instead. This situation is of course difficult to completely avoid when focusing on solving the problem of grain production, but if we take specific measures to strengthen the leadership of the development of economic crops while grasping grain production, some losses can be completely avoided. The failure to develop economic crops in large quantities, or even the shrinking situation, cannot but affect the labor income of farmers. Because the value of economic crops is higher than that of grain, planting more economic crops is a major way to increase the income of farmers in Guangdong, where there are many people and little land. In the past year or two, one of the main reasons why the grain production of many agricultural cooperatives has increased, but the income of members has decreased instead, is the result of the shrinking of the economic crop production of the cooperatives. The Provincial Party Committee has now decided that, in addition to advocating land reclamation and appropriately expanding cultivated land to plant economic crops, it plans to gradually take out 5 million mu of the existing 50 million mu of grain cultivated land to plant economic crops on the premise of increasing the yield per unit area.

Of course, this does not mean that Guangdong's agricultural production in the future will only develop economic crops, and the grain problem does not need to be paid attention to anymore. If only the benefits of planting economic crops in Guangdong are considered, then the more economic crops are planted, the better. It is best to change every mu of land in Guangdong to plant economic crops, and the grain needed by Guangdong will be supplied by other regions. This is of course just a fantasy and is completely unrealistic. According to the national grain production situation, it would be enough if the Central Committee could agree that Guangdong is self-sufficient in grain, and use the light industrial products and raw materials made from economic crops transferred out to replace the grain transferred out. Even so, Guangdong's grain production must still be fully paid attention to. By 1962, we should strive to achieve an average yield of 800 jin per mu for 45 million mu of grain cultivated land. The foundation of agricultural production is grain production, and the development of all other kinds of production must be carried out on this basis. When the grain problem is still in a serious situation and people are worried about not having enough to eat, the development of animal husbandry and economic crops will be difficult. Although the grain problem has eased compared to the past, it is still far from fundamentally solving the problem. After we complete this year's grain production plan, the average amount of grain per person in the province, including miscellaneous grains, is only 650 jin. According to the grain consumption level of people in Guangdong, animal husbandry feed, and other grain consumption, to fundamentally solve the problem, each person must average at least 800 jin. In particular, the population will continue to grow year by year, and grain consumption will increase accordingly. Therefore, the grain problem must not be estimated too optimistically, and must continue to be given great attention. The problem of actively developing economic crops must still be carried out on the basis of ensuring that grain production increases year by year. Therefore, it is one-sided to only pay attention to grain production and not plant as many economic crops as possible according to local conditions, or to only emphasize the development of economic crops and not consider the increasing grain needs of the people. Both will bring losses to the country and the people, and should be avoided and corrected.

A Major Measure for Substantial Increase in Production: Increase the Multiple Cropping Area and Gradually Achieve Three Crops a Year

The current major measure that enables Guangdong's agriculture to substantially increase production is to increase the multiple cropping area and gradually achieve three crops a year. In Guangdong, to tap the production potential, of course, it is necessary to innovate farming techniques, especially to promote close planting of rice (including a series of measures such as selecting fine varieties, selecting seeds with yellow mud water, sparsely sowing and cultivating strong seedlings, small seedlings and single and double seedling close planting, rational fertilization, rational drainage and irrigation, etc.) to increase the yield per unit area; it is also necessary to appropriately reclaim wasteland and expand the cultivated area. However, increasing the multiple cropping area and achieving three crops a year can increase grain production more than relying solely on increasing the yield per unit area, and it saves much more money than reclaiming wasteland. In the Chaoshan area of Guangdong, due to the large population and little land, there has long been a habit of planting a crop of miscellaneous grains or other crops in winter on the land of double-season rice, so it was a relatively high-yielding area in the past. After liberation, we summed up the original experience of the masses, systematically promoted it, and made most of the rice fields achieve three crops a year, so the grain yield increased significantly. For example, in Chaoan County in this area, as a result of expanding the multiple cropping area and taking other yield-increasing measures, the average grain yield per mu increased from 577 jin in 1949 to 1,017 jin in 1955. This experience of increasing grain production by increasing the multiple cropping area has also been greatly promoted in other areas of the province. The province has a current cultivated area of 54 million mu (including 4 million mu of short-term economic crops, but excluding 3 million mu of perennial economic crops). In 1955, the sown area reached 111.37 million mu, and the multiple cropping index was about 200 percent. If all the land that can be replanted is used, the sown area will reach 140 million mu, which is more than 28 million mu more than in 1955, and the multiple cropping index will be close to 260 percent. If we calculate an average increase of 200 jin of grain per mu, we can increase grain production by 5.6 billion jin, which is a considerable amount.

However, it must be pointed out that increasing the multiple cropping area and achieving three crops a year is by no means an easy task, but a major reform of the cropping system, which involves many aspects that need to be resolved. In addition to the need to coordinate well with natural conditions such as winter and spring climate and frost conditions, and considering the adaptability of the soil, to achieve three crops a year, the amount and time of water use have increased. Two seasons of rice and one winter crop, at least 240 cubic meters of water per mu per year must be controlled to be used, which requires vigorous water conservancy; the amount of fertilizer required has also increased, and it is necessary to actively develop pig raising, increase pig manure and urine fertilizer, and accumulate more miscellaneous fertilizer and plant more green manure to ensure sufficient fertilizer supply. At the same time, the old set of farming techniques and farming habits must also be reformed accordingly. What is particularly important is to solve the following two problems: One is to properly arrange crops, and winter crops must be selected appropriately, so that they can be planted after the autumn harvest and mature before the spring plowing of the coming year, so that all three crops a year have enough growing time and do not conflict with each other. According to the experience in Guangdong, the planting area of winter wheat should not be expanded any further, and the planting area of sweet potatoes should also be appropriately controlled. What can be planted in large quantities in winter are leguminous crops, especially red bean peas, which have a short maturity time, do not affect the planting of early rice in the coming year, and can increase the fertility of the land. In addition, we must also pay attention to rational rotation and intercropping, and strengthen the fertility of the land and improve the soil in many ways. The other is to solve the problem of labor. Because three crops a year generally increases the workload by nearly one-third compared to two crops, it is necessary to improve the labor organization, do a good job in the contracting system, reduce idleness and waste, improve work efficiency, and, if possible, actively improve tools and promote new agricultural tools to reduce the burden of labor and overcome the difficulty of insufficient labor caused by the implementation of three crops a year. Whether the above problems can be solved determines whether three crops a year can be achieved. Therefore, when promoting this measure, we must adapt to local conditions, take reliable measures, and gradually promote it. We must not promote it blindly in a one-size-fits-all manner, otherwise we will turn good things into bad things and lose more than we gain. In the past, the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee also had insufficient understanding of this issue. This was mainly because we saw too much of the favorable side, and underestimated the difficult side, so that some places blindly promoted three crops regardless of the conditions, resulting in losses in production. The masses criticized our cadres as "reckless experts" who did not understand production, and this criticism is not excessive.

In short, in the guidance of agricultural production in Guangdong, we have implemented the Central Committee's policy, and have therefore achieved results; but we have also made some mistakes, because we lack a deep understanding of the complexity of agricultural production, and also lack serious investigation and research. In our work, we have not systematically educated cadres to rely on the masses to do things, but often made decisions and measures based on some incomplete materials and experiences that are not typical enough, and forcibly implemented them. This one-sided subjective-idealist ideology and working style will undoubtedly not do things well. To do a good job in Guangdong's agricultural production, on the one hand, we must clarify the guiding policy of agricultural production, and on the more important hand, we must, in actual work, overcome the one-sided subjective-idealist ideology and working style in our leadership. All decisions must first be made after conscientiously doing investigation and research, and all work must resolutely follow the mass line. Only in this way can we guarantee the comprehensive completion of agricultural production tasks.

### 更全面更有效地执行以农业为重点的方针  陶铸同志的发言

    更全面更有效地执行以农业为重点的方针
    陶铸同志的发言
    我们广东省代表完全拥护毛泽东同志的开幕词，刘少奇同志代表党中央委员会所作的政治报告，周恩来同志关于发展国民经济的第二个五年计划的建议的报告和邓小平同志关于修改党章的报告。现在仅就广东农业生产的几个问题作一发言：
    在国家的第一个五年计划期间，广东省根据中央指示确定以农业为重点的工作方针，执行四年来，已经获得成效。随着国家经济建设特别是工业建设的迅速发展，广东的工业建设也将有很大的发展，这就要求我们以更大的力量和更积极的态度，去进行工业的生产建设。但是，在今后的几年内，广东省仍将继续采取以农业为重点的工作方针，努力把这个方针执行得更加全面，更有成效，以利于支援国家工业化和改善本省人民群众的生活。
    在第一个五年计划开始的时候，即在一九五三年，广东省在执行以农业为重点的方针上，党内外都有不同的意见，这主要是不从具体情况出发与不了解农业和工业的关系，特别是和轻工业的关系所致。
    为发展工业，主要是轻工业，准备条件
    执行以农业为重点的工作方针，并不是轻视工业，更不是不要在广东发展工业。只是由于当时全省的土地改革刚刚结束，大多数地区农业生产处于落后状态，粮食问题也很紧张，而作为发展轻工业原料的经济作物又急待恢复与发展；同时，地下资源完全不清楚，国家又一度确定沿海一带不建设工业。当时摆在全省人民面前的问题是：同国内各工业重点区一样以发展工业为重点呢？还是应当首先集中精力来搞好农业，以便切实地为广东发展工业创造条件，能够真正地迅速地转到以工业为重点呢？毫无疑问，在广东省应当以农业为重点来作为一个时期的工作方针。执行四年来的事实说明，这不论从广东人民的目前利益或者从国家的长远利益，即对国家工业建设作更大的支援着眼，都应该认为是正确的。就是在今天中央已经确定广东也必须积极地进行若干工业建设的时候，我们以农业为重点的方针，不仅不会影响广东今后工业建设的积极进行；相反地，它将会更进一步促进粮食生产特别是作为工业原料的经济作物生产的发展，为大力发展广东工业准备更好的条件。因为从广东所具有的亚热带的特殊地理条件和所处的国防前线的地位来看，主要的应当是发展轻工业；而发展轻工业，如果不首先发展农业，特别是发展作为轻工业原料的经济作物，那是不可能的。
    发展农业生产的条件，广东省可说是“得天独厚”
    在广东，发展农业生产的条件可以说是“得天独厚”的。全省气候温暖，绝大部分地区全年无霜期，平均温度是十九——二六度（冬春平均十七度左右），雨量充沛，全年平均雨量有一千六百公厘左右。加以多数地区劳动力比较充足，许多妇女又有参加农业主要劳动的习惯，因而发展农业生产是有极为巨大的潜在力的。现在的问题是：如何进一步充分地和合理地利用这些有利的条件，如何把蕴藏着的巨大潜力，迅速地挖掘出来，使广东农业生产得到更迅速的发展。根据几年来的摸索，我们认为最主要的问题是：第一，适应亚热带地区的特点，因地制宜多发展一些经济作物，使能地尽其利。第二，适应一年无霜期，农作物四季可以生长的特点，增加复种指数，逐步作到一年三熟，以充分利用土地。
    在实现了农业合作化的条件下，已有可能很好地挖掘生产潜力
    要能充分实现上述的要求，当然需要农业获得机械的装备，但是我们决不能消极等待农业机械装备好了以后才去行动。在今天实现了农业合作化的条件下，已有可能很好地来挖掘生产潜力。去年全省自然灾害很严重，在潮汕地区仍然出现三个平均每亩年产量千斤的“粮食千斤县”；今年虽然又发生各种不同程度的自然灾害，但是增产百分之十三的计划，还是有把握可以完成。这些都是农业生产潜力巨大的证明。在土地改革结束以后，我们依靠个体农民在土地改革后所出现的生产积极性，农业生产有所提高，但是个体小农经济的力量终究有限，而且很不稳定，不可能很大地提高劳动生产率，不可能进行稍为重大的农业技术改革与扩大再生产，一遇有较大的自然灾害就无能为力，所以在合作化以前广东的农业生产潜力的发挥，还是极为有限的。在合作化之后，情况就迥然不同了。例如在实行增加复种面积，即所谓一年三熟和水稻密植的技术改革这两项措施上，在合作化之前，虽然不断提倡，在六年之内增加冬种面积一共不过一千万亩；但是在合作化的头一年，即去年冬季，冬种面积就扩大了四百五十万亩。又如实行单造改为双造（包括两季间作改为两季连作），去年一个冬季就改了四百万亩，而前此六年则改得很少。一九五五年全省实行密植的稻田不到百分之二十，但今年上造却达到百分之七十五。
    为什么今年扩大复种面积这样多而过去的六年却那样少？今年推广水稻密植这样快而过去的六年却那样慢呢？原因很简单。扩大复种面积和推广密植需要很多的劳动力，需要具备水利和肥料这两个条件，而大量兴修水利和积集肥料，是需要更为大量的劳动力的，分散经营的个体农户就没有可能办到，只有合作化以后才能办到。由此可见，合作化的优越性首先表现在劳动效能的大大提高上面，而这正是在农业机械化以前所赖以挖掘农业生产潜力的决定性的条件。但是仍然需要引起我们注意的，是对农业生产的困难任何时候都必须要有足够的估计，如果看不到今天中国农业生产所存在的困难，积极设法加以克服，而以为合作化之后，从此天老爷将会变下雨为下谷子，指标定得很高，一味盲目乐观，那无疑地是错误的。广东省委过去对农业生产潜力的认识上，就犯过盲目乐观的错误。当着农业生产处于顺利的情况下，这种盲目乐观思想今后还可能抬头的，仍值得我们予以注意。
    在保证粮食增产的基础上，积极地大量发展经济作物
    充分利用广东的独特的自然条件，积极地大量发展经济作物，是十分必要的。几年来我们也提出了农业生产以粮食为主，同时因地制宜积极发展经济作物的方针。但是当着全国进入社会主义计划建设之后，粮食问题一直是一个最尖锐最紧张的问题，使我们不得不集中力量去解决粮食生产问题。几年以来，粮食生产确实是增产了，虽然一九五五年有着严重的自然灾害，全省粮食收获仍达到一九五四年二百二十亿斤的总产量，今年如果能够完成增产计划，粮食总产量可达二百五十亿斤。再加上中央今年又免除了广东的粮食外调任务，所以夏收后，全省粮食情况已较前大大缓和下来。农民口粮普遍比去年留得多，一部分增产较多的地区的合作社除了留足口粮与完成购粮征粮之外，还留了足够的饲料用粮。随着粮食情况的缓和、许多合作社已开始着手去扩大经济作物生产和发展畜牧业生产了。但是，应该指出，我们过去对经济作物的发展确是注意很不够的，除了比较集中的主要的几种，如甘蔗、黄麻、苎麻、花生等有相当的发展外，其它都没有得到应有的发展，有许多分散的、零星的但加起来数量是相当可观的经济作物反而萎缩了。这种情况当然是在集中解决粮食生产问题的情况下难以完全避免的，但是如果我们在抓紧粮食生产同时，采取具体措施，加强对发展经济作物的领导，有一些损失是完全可以避免的。经济作物没有得到大量发展，甚至萎缩的情况，不能不影响到农民的劳动收入。因为经济作物的价值都高过粮食，多种植经济作物对人多地少的广东说来，是增加农民的收入的一条主要办法。最近一两年来，有不少农业合作社粮食增了产，而社员收入反而减少了的主要原因之一，就是合作社的经济作物生产萎缩的结果。现在省委已经决定，除了提倡开荒，适当扩大耕地，以种植经济作物外，拟从现有五千万亩粮食耕地在提高单位面积产量的前提下，逐步拿出五百万亩改种经济作物。
    当然，这并不是说今后广东的农业生产只是发展经济作物，粮食问题不用再去注意了。如果仅从广东种植经济作物的收益去考虑，那就是经济作物种得愈多愈好，最好在广东的每一亩土地上都改种经济作物，而广东所需要的粮食则由其他地区负责供应。这当然只是一种空想，是完全不切实际的。根据全国粮食生产情况，中央如能答应广东粮食自给，以外调经济作物制成的轻工业品与原料来代替外调粮食就已经是很够了。即使如此，广东的粮食生产仍是必须充分予以注意的问题。到一九六二年应当争取四千五百万亩粮食耕地平均每亩能达到八百斤的产量。农业生产的基础是粮食生产，其他各种生产的发展必须在这一基础上进行，当着粮食问题还处在严重情况，人们担心肚子不饱的情况下，什么畜牧业、经济作物的发展都是困难的。现在粮食问题虽然较过去有了缓和，但是，距离根本解决问题还是很远的。在我们完成了今年的粮食生产计划之后，全省每人包括杂粮在内平均也只有六百五十斤粮食，按着广东人们口粮及畜牧饲料及其他一些粮食消费水平，要根本解决问题，每人至少平均要到八百斤。特别是人口还要年年增长，粮食消费将随之增加起来，因此，粮食问题还决不可估计得过于乐观，还必须继续予以极大的注意。对于积极发展经济作物的问题，依然必须在保证粮食产量逐年增加的基础上去进行。因此，只重视粮食生产，不因地制宜尽量多种些经济作物，或是只强调发展经济作物，不考虑到人们日益增加着的粮食需要，都是片面的，都会给国家、人民带来损失。应当加以避免和纠正。
    大量增产的一项主要措施：增加复种面积，逐步做到一年三熟
    当前使广东农业能够大量增产的一项主要的措施，是增加复种面积，逐步做到一年三熟。在广东，挖掘生产潜力，当然需要革新耕作技术，特别是要推广水稻密植（包括一系列的措施如选用良种，黄泥水选种，疏播育壮秧，小株及单双株密植，合理施肥，合理排灌等）以提高单位面积产量；也需要适当地进行开荒，扩大耕地面积。但是，增加复种面积，做到一年三熟，比之单靠提高单位面积产量能够更多地增产粮食，而比之开荒要省钱得多。在广东的潮汕地区，由于人多地少，很久以前那里就有在双季水稻的土地上冬种一造杂粮或其它作物的习惯，因此，那里在以前就是比较高产的地区。解放以后，我们总结了群众原有的经验，系统地加以推广，使大部分的水稻田都做到了一年三熟，因而粮食产量显著提高。例如这个地区的潮安县，由于扩大复种面积及采取其它一些增产措施的结果，粮食产量每亩平均由一九四九年的五百七十七斤，到一九五五年增加到一千零一十七斤。这种以增加复种面积来增加粮食产量的经验，在全省其它地区也有了很大的推广。全省现有五千四百万亩耕地（包括短期经济作物四百万亩，但不包括三百万亩多年生的经济作物），一九五五年播种面积已达到一亿一千一百三十七万亩，复种指数约为百分之二百。如果把可以复种的全部都利用起来，播种面积将达到一亿四千万亩，即比一九五五年还可增加二千八百多万亩，复种指数则接近百分之二百六十。如以每亩平均增产粮食二百斤计算，就可以增产五十六亿斤粮食，这个数目是相当可观的。
    但是，必须指出，增加复种面积，做到一年三熟，决不是一件轻而易举的事情，而是一项耕作制度的重大改革，它涉及到许多方面的问题需要加以解决。除了要根据冬春气候霜冻情况及考虑到土壤的适应性等自然条件的很好的配合外，要做到一年三熟，用水的数量和时间增加了，两季水稻一造冬种，每亩一年至少要能控制二百四十立方公尺的水量才能够用，这就要大力搞好水利；需用肥料的数量也增加了，必须积极发展养猪，增加猪粪尿肥，以及更多地积集杂肥，多种绿肥，才能保证有足够的肥料供应。同时，旧有的一套耕作技术与耕作习惯，也必须相应地加以改革，特别重要的是要解决以下两个问题：一是适当地安排作物，冬种作物更是要挑选适宜，使之能在秋收后种植，来年春耕前成熟，使一年三造作物都有足够的生长时间，而不致互相冲突。根据广东地区的经验，冬麦种植面积不宜再扩大，蕃薯种植面积也要适当予以控制，可以在冬季大量种植的是豆科作物，特别是红花豌豆，成熟时间短，不影响来年早稻的种植，并且能增加土地的肥力。此外，还必须注意合理进行轮作与间作，从多方面来增强地力，改良土壤。再一条是解决劳动力的问题。因为一年三熟，工作量一般要比两熟增加近三分之一，因此，必须健全劳动组织，搞好包工制，减少窝工浪费，提高工作效率，并且在可能条件下，积极改良工具和推广新式农具，减轻劳动力的负担，以克服由于推行一年三熟而产生的劳动力不足的困难。上述问题能不能解决，决定着能不能做到一年三熟。因此，在推广这项措施的时候，必须因地制宜，采取可靠的措施，逐步推广，决不可千篇一律，盲目地推行，否则必将把好事办成坏事，得不偿失。广东省委过去在这个问题上，也是认识不足的。这主要是过多地看到有利的一方面，而对困难的一方面则估计不足，以致有的地方不看条件如何，盲目推行三熟，结果使生产受到损失。群众批评我们的干部为不懂生产的“蛮干专家”，这个批评并不为过的。
    总之，在广东农业生产的指导上，我们是贯彻了中央的方针的，因而取得了成绩；但是我们也曾经犯过一些错误，这是因为我们对农业生产的复杂性还缺乏深刻的认识，也缺乏认真的调查研究，在工作中又没有系统地教育干部依靠群众办事，而往往依据一些不全面的材料与不够作典型的经验，便作出决定与措施，强行贯彻执行。这种片面的主观主义的思想方法与工作作风，无疑地是不会把事情办好的。要搞好广东的农业生产，一方面要明确农业生产的指导方针，而更重要的一方面，是必须在实际工作中，克服我们领导上片面的主观主义的思想方法与工作作风，一切决定要首先切实做好调查研究，一切工作要坚决走群众路线。只有这样，才能保证全面地完成农业生产任务。
