    Longstanding and Profound Friendship
    —The Friendly Relations Between the Chinese and Indonesian People
    Wu Shihuang
    When Premier Zhou Enlai visited Indonesia last year, he pointed out in a radio address to the Indonesian people: "The friendship between the Chinese people and the Indonesian people can be traced back to the very distant past."
    Indeed, the friendship between the Chinese and Indonesian people has a long and traditional history.
    Indonesian historian Yamin wrote in his book "Six Thousand Years of the Red and White Flag": Indonesian Stone Age culture was influenced by Chinese culture from the Yunnan region. By the first and second centuries BC, the Indonesian people were able to manufacture bronze and ironware, and this development of productive forces was also influenced by Chinese culture.
    The Jakarta Museum displays several huge bronze drums, the bodies and faces of which are all cast in bronze. They date from the first and second centuries BC and are similar in form to the bronze drums of ethnic minorities in southern China. The drums are decorated with exquisite pictures, and some drum faces even have several frogs cast on the edges, croaking towards the sky. Archaeologist Karlen Fuls wrote in the museum's prehistoric exhibition room description: The technology of manufacturing bronze in Indonesia was introduced from southern China (especially Yunnan) and Indochina in the centuries before the Christian era.
    According to the geographical records of the Chinese historical book "Han Shu," as early as two thousand years ago, Han Dynasty merchants had already reached Pizong in the Strait of Malacca and had economic contacts with the Indonesian people. This Pizong, according to the research of Japanese historian Fujita Toyohachi, is considered to be Pisheng Island (meaning Banana Island in Indonesian) between Sumatra and Singapore, which is Kunzong in Zheng He's nautical chart. Archaeologist Flings' research on Chinese Han Dynasty pottery unearthed in Java, Sumatra, and Kalimantan also believes that the Chinese had arrived in Indonesia for trade around the beginning of the Christian era, importing Chinese pottery into Indonesia.
    According to Chinese historical records, the first Indonesian envoy to China was from Java. Volume 6 of the "Hou Han Shu" Benji: In the sixth year of Yongjian (131 AD), "In December, envoys from the Ye Tiao Kingdom and the Shan Kingdom outside Rinan Qiao came" to China. Ye Tiao is Java. Subsequently, the Japo Vata, Holing, and Japo countries of Java successively sent envoys to China to promote trade. Srivijaya of Sumatra (later renamed Sanfoqi, with its center in present-day Palembang) also began sending envoys to China in 670 AD and maintained close ties with China until its demise in 1377. In 1003, the Sanfoqi envoy came to China and said that a temple had been newly built in the country, "wishing to be granted a name and a bell." The Chinese government immediately presented a plaque and a large bell. That temple no longer exists. According to the speculation of Indonesian historian Sanusi Pane, it was probably the Bangsuring Temple. In addition, Bali also sent envoys to China from 517 AD. Some Indonesian envoys came to China at the invitation of the Chinese government. Therefore, Indonesian historian Amin Pane wrote in his book "Indonesia in South Asia": "Since ancient times, China has been harmonious and friendly to the countries of Southeast Asia, and has often invited people from various countries of Southeast Asia to visit China." The Ming Dynasty sent the most envoys to Indonesia in Chinese history. Zheng He visited Indonesia every time he went to "the West" seven times from 1405 to 1433, greatly promoting trade between the two countries. During the three hundred years of the Ming Dynasty, Javanese envoys visited China twenty-five times, reaching the highest record in history.
    In terms of trade exchanges, Chinese merchants had long transported silk to Indonesia, and also taught the Indonesian people how to weave silk. Tows Decker wrote in "An Outline History of Indonesia": "Indeed, our ancestors learned the method of weaving silk with silk from China. Soon, we will weave silk ourselves." Chinese porcelain is a favorite item of the Indonesian people. Ma Huan wrote in "Yingya Shenglan": The Javanese "people like blue and white porcelain the most." Even today, many Indonesians still regard Chinese porcelain as a family heirloom, and porcelain plays a special role in marriage, funeral and sacrificial ceremonies. The Dayak people of Kalimantan especially cherish Chinese dragon jars and colored urns, and regard them as priceless treasures, and use them as "urn coffins" to store corpses. China applied "urn coffins" in very ancient times. The Dayak people’s method of burying with "urn coffins" was passed down from China, which proves once again that Chinese culture had relations with Indonesia in ancient times. In addition to transporting goods, Chinese merchants also brought a large number of copper coins, promoting the development of commodity and monetary relations in Indonesia. When Dutch colonists arrived in Indonesia in the early seventeenth century, they saw Chinese copper coins "circulating throughout Java and the surrounding islands." Currently, this type of copper coin is still circulating in Bali.
    The commodities exchanged between Indonesia and China were mainly spices. These are famous products of Indonesia, and the Moluccas Islands, which produce spices, are known as the "Spice Islands." Among the dozens of spices listed in the "Zhufanzhi" Zhishiwu section, many are specialties of Indonesia, such as "cloves from the Dasik and Java countries," "sandalwood from Java," and "pepper from Java." As is well known, pepper is Indonesia's largest export. Before European colonists came to plunder, almost all of it was shipped to China. Van Leur pointed out in "Ancient Trade in Asia": Chinese merchants were the only buyers of Indonesian pepper in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Indonesia produced about 60,000 bags (2,400 tons) of pepper annually, of which 50,000 bags were shipped to China. Van Leur also pointed out: Apart from pepper, sandalwood was the second largest export, and it was also almost entirely shipped to China. According to his estimate, China purchased 300 to 400 bags (approximately 200 to 300 tons) annually. From this, it can be clearly seen that before European colonists invaded Indonesia, the trade relations between China and Indonesia were very close.
    The mutual influence of our two countries in culture is particularly profound. In the seventh century AD, Buddhism flourished in Srivijaya, Sumatra, and became the center of Buddhist studies in Southeast Asia. More than a thousand scholars from all over came here to study Buddhist scriptures. In 671 AD, Tang Dynasty monk Yijing went to Srivijaya to study Sanskrit and Buddhist scriptures, and then went to India for further studies. When he returned to China, he stayed in Srivijaya for more than ten years, studying and translating Buddhist scriptures. His "A Record of the Buddhist Religion as Practiced in India and the Malay Archipelago," written in Srivijaya, is an important source of information for studying ancient Buddhism in Indonesia today. He advocated that if Chinese monks want to go to India to study Buddhist scriptures, it is best to study in Srivijaya first. He gave a high evaluation to Indonesian culture. Another eminent Tang Dynasty monk, Huining, went to Holing (Java) to study Buddhist scriptures from 664 to 665, staying for three years and co-translating the Agama Sutra in two volumes (recording the event of Tathagata's Nirvana cremation) with the famous Javanese monk Jonabhadra. According to the Biographies of Eminent Monks Who Sought Dharma in the Tang Dynasty, in addition to the aforementioned Yijing and Huining, there were nineteen Tang Dynasty monks who went to Indonesia to study Buddhist scriptures, reaching a peak for a time. Some of these monks also studied the Indonesian language, such as Yunqi, Dajin, and Zhengu. The Chinese people have always valued the Indonesian language, considering it to have beautiful pronunciation and to be a "language of music." Ma Huan said in "Yingya Shenglan" that the Javanese "national language is very beautiful and soft." Chinese historical books also record the Indonesian language, such as the "Song Shi" Volume 489 Java Kingdom: "The vernacular word for pearls is modixialuo, the word for teeth is jialuo, the word for incense is kundunlulin, and the word for rhinoceros is dimi."
    Due to the contact between the Chinese people and the people of Southeast Asia, Chinese farming methods also had a huge impact on the people of Southeast Asia. The plows and rakes used by the Tungku people of Kalimantan were influenced by Chinese culture. Indonesian tea varieties and tea making technology were introduced from China. The "Dutch East Indies Encyclopedia" pointed out: "In 1829, Chinese tea varieties and tea trees were introduced to Java. In 1832 and 1833, Yakuson hired several Chinese tea making technicians from Guangdong to Java." Indonesian linguist Husain Wunaf wrote in the "Indonesian Encyclopedia": "The manufacturing methods of bean paste, tofu, and winter melon candy were introduced to Indonesia from China." In addition, the technology of brewing wine from cane sugar and making soy sauce from soybeans was also introduced from China. The Indonesian people love sweet soy sauce (made by adding sugar to soy sauce), which is an indispensable seasoning for three meals. As is well known, the Indonesian nation is a seafaring nation. As early as two thousand years ago, their sailing ships had sailed to Madagascar on the east coast of Africa. The light sampans that Indonesians drive daily are learned from China, and are also called "sampans" like China. The "Dutch East Indies Encyclopedia" says: "Indonesian music is influenced by China, India, and Arabia." The "Gambang Kromong" popular in Jakarta and Banten uses the Chinese note "gongche" to record tunes, and uses a mixture of instruments from both countries to play, which is a product of cultural exchange between the two countries. Indonesian painter Suryono said: "There is a mosque in Palembang, built in the eighteenth century, which is completely in Chinese style." In 1954, representatives of the Indonesian Education Union reported at a reception for the Chinese teachers' visiting group that Japara, the famous carving center of Java, was developed by a young man named Hadison after he went to China in the sixteenth century to study carving and returned to Indonesia. The Jakarta Museum Guide also points out: "Javanese carvings are greatly influenced by China and India." An Indonesian special issue published by the Indonesian Embassy in China points out: Chinese influences can be clearly seen in Indonesian languages, national costumes, and customs. The special issue also included two pictures, one showing a flower skirt pattern based on Chinese painting clouds, and the other showing a Srivijaya dance costume similar to Beijing opera costumes, specifically illustrating the relationship between Chinese and Indonesian culture.
    After China and Indonesia each established new countries, the friendly relations between the two countries immediately had new developments, and cultural and economic ties are also increasing. First, our two countries resumed normal trade relations, and then the prime ministers of the two countries visited each other, and the friendship between the people of the two countries is increasing day by day. This year, our acrobatic troupe visited Indonesia to perform, and the Indonesian Bali dance troupe also came to our country to perform; this August, Vice Chairman Soong Ching Ling visited Indonesia, and now, President Sukarno will visit our country again. President Sukarno's visit to our country will undoubtedly greatly enhance the long-standing and profound friendship between the people of our two countries!

    悠久深厚的友谊
    ——中国和印度尼西亚人民的友好关系
    吴世璜
    去年周恩来总理访问印度尼西亚时，在向印度尼西亚人民发表的广播演说中曾经指出：“中国人民和印度尼西亚人民之间的友谊，可以追溯到很遥远的过去。”
    的确，中国、印度尼西亚两国人民的友谊是有悠久、传统的历史的。
    印度尼西亚史学家雅明在“红白旗六千年史”一书中写道：印度尼西亚石器时代文化受着来自云南地区的中国文化的影响。到了公元前一、二世纪，印度尼西亚人民已能制造青铜器和铁器，这种生产力的发展，同样也是受着中国文化的影响。
    雅加达博物馆中陈列着几个巨大的青铜鼓，鼓身和鼓面全用青铜铸成，是公元前一、二世纪间的出品，其形式与中国南方少数民族的青铜鼓相似，鼓上有精美的图画，有的鼓面边缘还铸了几只青蛙仰天而鸣。考古学家卡连富尔斯在该馆的史前展览室说明书中写道：印度尼西亚制造青铜器的技术，是公元前数世纪间由中国南部（特别是云南）和印度支那传来的。
    根据中国史书“汉书”地理志的记载，远在二千年前，汉代商人就已到达马六甲海峡的皮宗和印度尼西亚人民发生经济联系了。这皮宗，据日本历史学者藤田丰八的考证，认为是苏门答腊和新加坡之间的皮声岛（印度尼西亚语意为香蕉岛），即郑和航海图中的昆宗。考古学家弗玲斯从爪哇、苏门答腊，和加里曼丹出土的中国汉朝陶器的研究，也认为公元纪元时中国人已到印度尼西亚通商，把中国陶器输入印度尼西亚。
    据我国史册记载，印度尼西亚最早派遣使者来中国的是爪哇，“后汉书”卷六本纪：永建六年（公元一三一年）“十二月日南侥外叶调国、掸国遣使”来中国。叶调即爪哇。接着爪哇的闍婆婆达、呵陵、闍婆等国陆续派遣使者来中国促进贸易。苏门答腊的室利佛逝（后改称三佛齐，中心地在现在的巨港）也于公元670年开始派遣使者来中国，一直到1377年国亡前始终和中国保持着密切的联系。1003年三佛齐使者来中国，称说该国新建一座庙宇，“愿赐名及钟”。中国政府当即赠送一块匾额和一个大钟。那座庙宇今已不存，据印度尼西亚史家沙努西·巴尼的推测，大概是榜苏陵庙。此外婆利（峇厘）亦于517年起派遣使者来中国。印度尼西亚使者前来中国有些是应邀而来的，所以印度尼西亚史家阿明·巴尼在“南亚的印度尼西亚”一书中写道：“自古以来中国对南洋诸国和睦亲善，经常邀请南洋各国人民到中国访问。”中国历朝使者到印度尼西亚访问次数最多的是明朝。郑和在1405年至1433年七下“西洋”，每次都到印度尼西亚访问，大大地促进了两国间的贸易。明朝三百年间，爪哇使者先后到中国二十五次，在历史上达到了最高纪录。
    在贸易交流方面，中国商人早就把丝绸运到印度尼西亚，同时还把织绸的方法教给印度尼西亚人民。陶威斯·德克尔在“印度尼西亚历史纲要”一书中写道：“的确，我们的祖先是向中国学习用蚕丝织绸的方法，不久，我们自己就会织绸了。”中国的磁器是印度尼西亚人民非常喜爱的物品，马欢在“瀛涯胜览”中写道：爪哇“国人最喜青花磁器”，直到今天，还有许多印度尼西亚人把中国磁器作为传家之宝，在婚丧祭祀的仪式上，磁器有着特殊的作用。加里曼丹大雅克族尤其珍爱中国的龙缸彩瓮，视为无价之宝，并把它作为“瓮棺”，储藏尸骸。中国在很古的时代就应用“瓮棺”，大雅克族用“瓮棺”埋葬的方法，是从中国传去的，这又证明中国文化在远古时代就和印度尼西亚发生关系了。中国商人除了运载商品，还带去了大量铜钱，促进印度尼西亚商品、货币关系的发展。十七世纪初荷兰殖民者到印度尼西亚时见中国铜钱“通行于全爪哇及环近岛屿”。目前这种铜钱仍通行于峇厘。
    印度尼西亚方面和中国交流的商品主要是香料，这是印度尼西亚的著名产品，出产香料的摩鹿加群岛向有“香料群岛”之称。“诸蕃志”卷下志物篇所列举的数十种香料，其中有许多是印度尼西亚的特产，如“丁香出大食、闍婆（爪哇）诸国”，“檀香出闍婆”，“胡椒出闍婆”。如所周知，胡椒是印度尼西亚最大宗的输出品，在欧洲殖民者未来掠夺之前，几乎全部运销中国。范里尔在“亚洲古代贸易”一文中指出：十五、六世纪时中国商人是印度尼西亚胡椒的唯一购买者，印度尼西亚每年出产胡椒约六万包（二千四百吨），其中有五万包运销中国。范里尔又指出：胡椒而外，檀香是第二种大宗输出品，也是几乎全部运销中国，据他估计中国每年购买三、四百包（约二、三百吨）。由此可以清楚地看出，在欧洲殖民者尚未入侵印度尼西亚之前，中国和印度尼西亚之间的贸易关系是非常密切的。
    我们两国在文化上的互相影响尤为深厚。公元七世纪时，苏门答腊室利佛逝佛教兴盛，成为东南亚佛学研究的中心，各方学者来此研究佛经的有千余人。公元671年唐高僧义净到室利佛逝学习梵文，研究佛经，然后到印度继续深造，归国时又在室利佛逝居留十余年，研究和翻译佛经。他在室利佛逝写的“南海寄归内法传”，是今天研究印度尼西亚古代佛教的重要资料。他主张中国和尚如果要到印度研究佛经，最好先在室利佛逝学习，他对于印度尼西亚文化是给予很高的评价的。唐朝另一位高僧会宁于664至665年间到呵陵（爪哇）研究佛经，居留三年，和爪哇著名僧人若那跋陀罗合译佛经阿笈摩二卷（记如来涅槃焚身事）。据大唐求法高僧传所载，唐朝和尚到印度尼西亚研究佛经的除上述义净、会宁二人以外，还有十九位，极一时之盛。这些和尚有的还研究印度尼西亚语，例如运期、大津、贞固等。中国人民一向重视印度尼西亚语，认为它发音优美，是“音乐的语言”，马欢在“瀛涯胜览”中说爪哇“国语甚美软”。中国史书上亦有记载印度尼西亚语言的，如“宋史”卷489闍婆国：“方言谓真珠为没爹虾罗，谓牙为家啰，谓香为昆炖卢林，谓犀为低密。”
    由于中国人民和东南亚人民的接触，中国的耕种方法也给予东南亚人民以巨大影响。加里曼丹董坡孛人使用的犁和耙是受了中国文化的影响的。印度尼西亚的茶种和制茶技术是从中国传入的。“荷印大百科全书”指出：“1829年中国茶种及茶树传入爪哇。1832年和1833年耶谷逊从广东聘请数位中国制茶技术人员到爪哇。”印度尼西亚语语言学家胡沙英·巫纳夫在“印度尼西亚百科全书”中写道：“豆酱、豆腐和东瓜糖的制造法是从中国传入印度尼西亚的。”此外用蔗糖酿酒和用大豆制造酱油的技术，也是由中国传入的，印度尼西亚人民喜爱甜酱油（在酱油中加糖调制），是三餐不可缺的调味品。如所周知，印度尼西亚民族是善于航海的民族，远在二千年前他们的帆船就已远航到非洲东岸的马达加斯加。印度尼西亚人日常驾驶的轻便小舟“舢舨”，是向中国学习的，而且也像中国一样称之为“舢舨”。“荷印大百科全书”说：“印度尼西亚音乐受中国、印度和阿拉伯的影响。”流行于雅加达、文登一带的“甘梆·格罗摩”，用中国音符“工尺”记录曲子，用两国乐器混合演奏，是两国文化交流的产物。印度尼西亚画家苏约诺说：“巨港有座清真寺，建于十八世纪，完全是中国式”。1954年印度尼西亚教育工会代表在招待中国教师访问团的会上报告：爪哇著名的雕刻业中心札巴拉，是由一位名叫哈迪森的青年在十六世纪到中国学习雕刻回到印度尼西亚之后发展起来的。雅加达博物馆指南亦指出：“爪哇的雕刻很受中国、印度的影响”。印度尼西亚驻华大使馆出版的印度尼西亚特刊指出：在印度尼西亚语言中、民族服装上以及风俗习惯上都可以很清楚地看到中国的影响。该特刊还附了二张图片，一张是以中国画的云彩为花裙的图案，另一张是类似京戏服装的室利佛逝舞的服装，具体说明了中、印文化的关系。
    在中国和印度尼西亚两国各自建立了新的国家之后，两国的友好关系，立即有了新的发展，文化和经济上的联系也在日益加强。首先我们两国恢复了正常的贸易关系，接着两国总理互相访问，两国人民的友谊日益加强。今年我国杂技团到印度尼西亚访问演出，而印度尼西亚峇厘舞蹈团也来我国表演；今年8月宋庆龄副委员长访问印度尼西亚，现在，苏加诺总统又将到我国访问。苏加诺总统的来访我国，无疑地，将大大地增进我们两国人民悠久深厚的友谊！
