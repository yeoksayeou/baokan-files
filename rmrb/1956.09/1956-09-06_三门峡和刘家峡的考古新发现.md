New Archaeological Discoveries at Sanmenxia and Liujiaxia

The Yellow River Reservoir Archaeological Team, jointly formed by the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China, has completed the preliminary survey work in the Sanmenxia and Liujiaxia reservoir areas, and has gained rich harvests.

In Sanmenxia, 211 ancient human habitation sites were discovered, including the Mesolithic (?) era and the "Shayuan Culture" of the early Neolithic Age, the Yangshao and Longshan cultures of the Neolithic Age, and the sites of the Yin, Zhou, Han, Tang, and Song dynasties, with a total area of ​​70 million square meters. Among them, the more important is the first discovery of microliths in the sand dune areas of Chaoyi and Dali in Shaanxi, including more than 3,000 pieces of a large number of struck microliths, flake tools, and unprocessed flakes, with absolutely no pottery shards coexisting. According to current data, it may belong to a new culture, which we tentatively call "Shayuan Culture." Although the microliths here are similar to the microlithic culture of the north, the flake tools among them have very significant characteristics, especially the pointed tools are very similar to the products of the Paleolithic era, and this type is lacking in general microlithic cultures. Due to the lack of stratigraphic evidence, it is currently not easy to determine the age. This culture is also very different from the Yangshao and Longshan cultures in the vicinity, which are mainly engaged in agricultural production. This is the first time that Mesolithic (?) era and early Neolithic remains have been provided in the Yellow River basin, which is worth studying in detail in the future.

The richest in the Sanmenxia area are the Neolithic remains, especially the Yangshao culture, which accounts for about half of the total area of ​​the Sanmenxia site. The distribution is very dense, the relics are rich and varied, indicating that the Yangshao culture has undergone a long-term and diverse development here. This will definitely make a significant contribution to solving the periodization of the Yangshao culture and its relationship with other cultures, and to clarifying its social organization, production activities, and the development process of material culture.

Another important discovery near Sanmenxia is about some engineering measures taken in ancient times to conquer the natural barrier of Sanmenxia and ensure the transportation of grain from east to west, such as the plank roads of the Han Dynasty, the Kaiyuan New River of the Tang Dynasty, the mountain road on the north bank of the Yellow River, and the granaries east and west of Sanmenxia. The discovery of these great ancient projects to transform nature reveals some specific historical facts about the use of the Yellow River for water transport.

The Liujiaxia Reservoir is one of the central areas of ancient cultural development in our country and occupies an important position in archeology. A total of 176 human sites (including tombs) have been discovered here, with a total area of ​​10 million square meters, including the Gansu Yangshao, Qijia, Xindian, Siwa cultures, and Han Dynasty sites. In addition, a new cultural site has been discovered, tentatively named the "Tangwang Culture" site. The most important gain of this survey is that, according to the layers of underground deposits, the relative chronology of ancient cultures in Gansu has been formulated, correcting the past archaeological workers' division of ancient cultures in the Gansu area into six periods: "Qijia, Banshan, Machang, Xindian, Siwa, Shajing," mistakenly believing that they belonged to one cultural system and were passed down in one continuous line. According to newly discovered evidence, the sequence of cultural alternation here is Gansu Yangshao Culture (Banshan, Machang) - Qijia Culture - Xindian Culture. "Tangwang Culture", Siwa Culture, and Shajing Culture, which is not found here, may be other cultural systems that were contemporaneous with the Xindian Culture. This corrects the erroneous statement of "six periods."

The ancient culture of the Gansu region is relatively complex, and some of these cultures may belong to the early cultures of our fraternal nationalities. We believe that future excavations may provide more new information and be of great help to the periodization of ancient cultures in Gansu.

The archaeological survey of Sanmenxia and Liujiaxia is a large-scale general survey, which is an unprecedented initiative in the history of Chinese archeology. Nearly 400 ancient sites have been discovered in these two reservoir areas, with a total area of ​​80 million square meters, which is rare in the world. Through the archaeological excavation work of these two reservoirs, rich material cultural data will definitely be provided, which will help the study of ancient history in our country.

    三门峡和刘家峡的考古新发现
    中国科学院和中华人民共和国文化部联合组成的黄河水库考古工作队，已经结束了三门峡和刘家峡两个水库区的初步调查工作，获得了丰富的收获。
    在三门峡，发现古人类居住遗址二百十一处，包括中石器（？）时代以及新石器时代初期的“沙苑文化”，新石器时代的仰韶，龙山文化和殷、周、汉、唐、宋代遗址，总面积达七千万平方米。其中比较重要的是在陕西朝邑和大荔的砂丘地带第一次发现了细石器，包括大量打制的细石器、石片石器以及未经加工的石片等三千余件，绝对不见陶片共存。据目前的资料观察，它可能是属于一种新的文化，我们暂且称它为“沙苑文化”。这里的细石器虽与北方的细石器文化相似，但其中的石片石器却具有很显著的特点，特别是尖状器很像旧石器时代的产物，在一般的细石器文化中是缺少这种类型的。因为缺乏地层上的证据，目前还不容易确定时代。这个文化和附近以农业生产为主的仰韶和龙山文化也有很大区别，这是在黄河流域首次提供了中石器（？）时代以及新石器时代初期的遗存，值得今后详细加以研究。
    三门峡区最丰富的是新石器时代的遗存，尤以仰韶文化为最多，约占三门峡遗址总面积的半数。分布非常密集，遗物丰富，富于变化，说明了仰韶文化在这里曾经经过长期多样的发展。这对解决仰韶文化的分期和其他文化的关系、对阐明它的社会组织、生产活动以及物质文化发展过程，一定会有重大贡献。
    在三门峡附近另一重要发现是关于古代为征服三门峡天险保证由东向西运输粮食而采取的一些工程措施，如汉代的栈道、唐代的开元新河、黄河北岸的山路和三门峡东西的仓址。这些古代改造自然的伟大工程的发现，揭示了利用黄河漕运的一些具体史实。
    刘家峡水库是我国远古文化发展的中心地区之一，在考古学上占有重要的地位。这里共发现了人类遗址（包括墓葬）一百七十六处，总面积一千万平方公尺。包括甘肃仰韶、齐家、辛店、寺洼等文化和汉代遗址。此外还发现了一处新的文化遗存，暂名为“唐汪文化”遗址。这次调查的最重要的收获，是根据地下堆积的层次，拟定了甘肃远古文化的相对年代，纠正了过去考古工作者把甘肃一带的远古文化分为“齐家、半山、马厂、辛店、寺洼、沙井”六期，误认为它们是属于一个文化系统，一脉相传。根据新发现的证据，这里文化交替顺序是甘肃仰韶文化（半山、马厂）——齐家文化——辛店文化。“唐汪文化”、寺洼文化、以及这里所没有的沙井文化，都可能是和辛店文化同时的另外系统的文化。这就纠正了“六期”的错误说法。
    甘肃地区远古文化是比较复杂的，其中某些文化可能是属于我国兄弟民族的早期文化。我们相信今后的发掘，可能提供更多的新资料，对甘肃远古文化的分期问题也有很大帮助。
    三门峡和刘家峡的考古调查是一次面积广规模大的普查工作，在中国考古学史上是空前的创举。在这二个水库地区就发现了近四百处古代遗址，总面积达八千万平方公尺，在世界上也是少有的。通过这两个水库的考古发掘工作，一定会提供丰富的物质文化资料，有助于我国古代历史的研究。
