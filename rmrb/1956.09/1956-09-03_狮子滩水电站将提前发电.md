Shizitan Hydropower Station to Generate Electricity Ahead of Schedule

(Xinhua News Agency) Production preparations prior to electricity generation at the Shizitan Hydropower Station in Sichuan are being intensified. Currently, some of the projects related to power generation at the station have been basically completed, and others are nearing completion.

As of August 31, the water storage capacity of the Shizitan Reservoir had already exceeded the minimum height required for power generation. Production dispatch personnel, as well as personnel responsible for communications, relay protection, and power grid management, dispatched by the Chongqing Electric Power Bureau have all arrived at the construction site. The work of operating workers studying blueprints is nearing completion; technicians are compiling operating procedures on-site. The start-up acceptance preparation working group, jointly organized by the Shizitan Hydropower Engineering Bureau, the Electromechanical Installation Company of the Ministry of Electric Power Industry's Hydropower General Bureau, the Chengdu Hydroelectric Investigation and Design Institute, and the Chongqing Electric Power Bureau, has also been established and is preparing for trial operation.

Construction of the Shizitan Hydropower Station began in August 1954 and was originally scheduled to be completed and generate electricity by the end of 1957. Judging from the current progress of the project, the power generation-related projects of this station can be completed and begin generating electricity in September of this year.

    狮子滩水电站将提前发电
    据新华社讯　四川狮子滩水电站发电前的生产准备工作正在加紧进行。现在电站有关发电的工程有的基本完工，有的接近完工。
    到8月31日为止，狮子滩水库的蓄水量已经超过了发电所需要的最低高度。由重庆电业局派出的生产调度人员和通讯、继电保护、电网管理等人员都到达工地。运转工人学习图纸的工作快要结束了；技术人员正在现场编制运行规程。由狮子滩水力发电工程局、电力工业部水电总局机电安装公司、成都水力发电勘测设计院、重庆电业局等单位共同组织的起动验收准备工作小组，也已经成立，正在进行试运转前的准备工作。
    狮子滩水电站在1954年8月开工兴建，原计划在1957年年底建成发电。从目前工程进展情况来看，这个电站的有关发电工程可以在今年9月完工并开始发电。
