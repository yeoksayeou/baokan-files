Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, September 9th – Before the autumn harvest is even complete, agricultural cooperatives in various parts of Jiangsu Province have already made preparations for planting wheat. In the drought-prone areas north of the Yangtze River in Xuhuai, where the season starts earlier, most agricultural cooperatives have begun plowing the land. In Donghai County, seventy-eight agricultural cooperatives have newly purchased over 400 head of draft cattle and over 160 horses and donkeys, preparing to use double-wheeled, double-share plows. Agricultural cooperatives in the Xuzhou Special District have already accumulated twelve dan of fertilizer for each mu of wheat field. Counties such as Tongshan and Fengxian in this special district are preparing to implement dense planting during sowing and are actively modifying seeders. In the rice-growing areas south of the Yangtze River, where the season starts later, many agricultural cooperatives are seizing the gaps in current rice field management work to increase the accumulation of natural fertilizers. In the Taihu area, there are often more than 10,000 farm boats dredging mud and harvesting grass.

Currently, local agricultural leading organs are helping agricultural cooperatives train technicians. Before the autumn planting, more than 30,000 production team leaders and cooperative members will successively enter training classes to study. Insecticides and double-wheeled, double-share plows supplied by the supply and marketing cooperatives are also ready, and some have already been supplied to the cooperative members.

    江苏各地农业社准备种麦
    新华社南京9日电　还没有收秋，江苏省各地农业社已经作好了种麦的准备工作。长江以北的徐淮旱作地区季节较早，大部分农业社开始耕地，东海县七十八个农业社新买四百多头耕牛和一百六十多匹马和驴子，准备使用双轮双铧犁耕地。徐州专区的农业社已为每亩麦田积好十二担肥料。这个专区的铜山、丰县等县准备播种时实行密植，正在积极改装播种器。长江以南稻作地区季节较晚，很多农业社正抓紧目前稻田管理工作的空隙增积自然肥料，太湖地区经常有一万多只农船出动罱泥捞草。
    目前，各地农业领导机关正在帮助农业社训练技术员，秋种前将有三万多个生产队长和社员陆续进训练班学习。由供销社供应的治虫药剂和双轮双铧犁也都准备好了，有的已供应到社员手中。
