    How to Correctly Understand "Equal Pay for Equal Work" for Men and Women

    In rural areas, many people have not truly understood the meaning of "equal pay for equal work" for men and women. Some people think that "equal pay for equal work" can only be achieved if women can do the same work as men. For example, if a man can carry two hundred catties, a woman must also be able to carry two hundred catties; if a man can open mountains and dig cellars, a woman must also be able to open mountains and dig cellars... Some people think that "equal pay for equal work" for men and women means that men and women laborers should receive the same pay for doing the same amount of work. That is to say, no matter what kind of work they do, if a man works for a day, he gets ten work points, and a woman should also get ten work points for working for a day. Are these views correct? Many readers have written asking for answers.

    We believe that both of these views are incorrect.

  The meaning of "equal work" does not mean that men and women should do the same kind of work or work of the same intensity. There are many kinds of jobs in rural production. Some jobs are light, some are heavy, some are rough, and some are delicate. Farmers, whether male or female, have differences in age, strength, and skill. Even among male laborers, Zhang San may be able to carry two hundred catties, but Li Si may not be able to carry two hundred catties. Older people may be able to do some kinds of work well, but younger people may not be able to do them well. Since we cannot force all male laborers to be all-rounders in production and have the same strength, we certainly cannot require women to be all-rounders and have the same strength as men. Due to physiological limitations, women are generally not suitable for heavy work and cannot be compared with strong men, just as weaker men cannot be compared with very strong men in terms of physical strength. The fact that women cannot compare with men in terms of physical strength does not mean that women's work is necessarily worse than men's. Women often do some jobs that are particularly suitable for them better than men. Some jobs require certain skills, and women may not be able to do them today, and are not as good as men with skills, but tomorrow, when they have learned them, they can be as good as men with skills. Some strong and experienced women who participate in production labor can also do heavy work like men and can become all-rounders in agricultural production. In short, "equal work" does not require women to do the same work as men in general. If that were the case, there would be no need to implement division of labor in production management, and there would be no need to assign work according to the specific situation of each laborer.

      "Equal work" does not mean that men and women do the same amount of work in the same amount of time. As mentioned above, farm work is light and heavy, rough and fine, and laborers have differences in strength and skill. In the same amount of time, different laborers doing the same farm work may complete different quantities and achieve different qualities; the same laborer, using the same amount of time to do various different farm jobs, cannot achieve completely consistent labor results. Calculating labor remuneration purely based on the length of working time is inherently unreasonable. The purpose of implementing "equal pay for equal work" for men and women is to realize the principle of "distribution according to work" among male and female laborers. Since it is unreasonable to calculate the labor remuneration of various laborers purely based on the length of labor time, we cannot judge whether "equal pay for equal work" has been achieved for male and female laborers solely based on whether the working time is the same.

    How should we correctly understand "equal pay for equal work" for men and women? The correct understanding should be: Women participating in production labor, no matter what kind of work they do, should be calculated remuneration based on the quantity and quality of their work, just like men. If women do as much work as men and as well, they should receive the same pay as men; if they do more work than men and do it better, they should receive more pay than men; if they do less work than men and do it worse, they should receive less pay than men. We cannot simply assume that women's labor is generally worse than men's and give them lower pay across the board, regardless of how much or how well they do the work; nor can we, in order to take care of women, give them the same pay as men, even if they do the work worse than men.

    To truly achieve "equal pay for equal work" for men and women, agricultural production cooperatives must first make appropriate divisions of labor according to the strength and skill of male and female members and make reasonable arrangements for women's work. At the same time, it is necessary to formulate work quotas and remuneration standards and implement piece-rate wages. Calculating the labor of each member according to work quotas and remuneration standards can accurately achieve "equal pay for equal work."

### 怎样正确理解男女“同工同酬”

    怎样正确理解男女“同工同酬”
    在农村里，男女“同工同酬”的意思许多人还没有真正弄清楚。有人认为：必须男人能干的活妇女也能干，才能够实现“同工同酬”。比如，男的能担二百斤，女的也要能担二百斤；男的能开山、打窖，女的也要能开山、打窖……。有人认为：男女“同工同酬”就是：男女劳动力做同样时间的活，就可以得到同样的报酬。也就是说，不管干什么样的活，男的干一天得十个工分，女的干一天也应该得十个工分。究竟这些看法对不对呢？不少读者来信要求解答。
    我们认为，这两种看法都不对。
  “同工”的意思并不是要男女同做一种活或者同做劳动强度同样大小的活。农村生产的活计是多种多样的。有的活轻，有的活重，有的活粗，有的活细。农民无论男女，都有年青年老、劳力强弱、技术高低的差别。同是男劳动力，张三能担二百斤，李四就不一定也能担二百斤。同一种活，老年人能做好，青年人就不一定能做好。既然不能强求所有的男劳力在生产上都是全把式，都有同样的力气，当然也不能要求妇女也是全把式，也和男人有同样的力气。妇女因为生理条件的限制，一般的不适于干过重的活，不能同身体强壮的男人相比，正像劳力较弱的男人，不能和劳力很强的男人比体力一样。妇女不能和男人比体力，并不是说妇女做活就一定比男人差。有些特别适合妇女做的活，妇女做起来常常比男人做的好。有些需要有某种技术才能干的活，妇女今天不会做，比不上有技术的男人，明天她们学会了，也就可以比上有技术的男人。有些身强力壮、参加生产劳动有了经验的妇女，她们也可以同男人一样干重活，也可以成为农业生产上的全把式。总之，“同工”并不是要求妇女和男人干活一般齐，男的能做什么，女的一定也能做什么。假如要那样，在生产管理上也就不需要实行分工分业，不需要按每个劳动者的具体情况进行分工了。
      “同工”的意思也不是指男女做同样时间的活。上面说过，农活有轻有重，有粗有细，劳动者有劳力强弱、技术高低的差别。在同一个时间内，不同的劳动力干同一样农活，各个人完成的数量，达到的质量不一定相同；同一个劳力，用相同的时间干各种不同的农活，劳动效果也不能完全一致。单纯以干活时间的长短来计算劳动报酬，这种计算方法本身就不合理。实行男女“同工同酬”的目的就是为了在男女劳动者之间实现“按劳取酬”的原则，单纯以劳动时间的长短来计算各种劳动力的劳动报酬既然不合理，那么，对男女劳动者是否做到“同工同酬”，也就不能光从劳动时间是否相同上面去看了。
    对于男女“同工同酬”究竟应该怎样理解才是正确的呢？正确的理解应当是：妇女参加生产劳动，无论干什么活，都应当和男人一样，根据她们所做工作的数量和达到的质量计算报酬。妇女干活和男人同样多同样好，就该和男人得到同样的报酬；比男人干的多、干的好，就应该比男人多得报酬；比男人干的少、干的坏，就应该比男人少得报酬。不能因为妇女的劳力一般的比男人差些，就不问妇女做活多少好坏，报酬一律比男人低些；也不能为了要照顾妇女，就不管妇女做活比男人差，也硬要给予和男人同样的报酬。
    要真正实现男女“同工同酬”，农业生产合作社首先要按照男女社员的劳力强弱、技术高低进行适当的分工，对妇女的工作作合理的安排。同时，要制定工作定额和报酬标准，实行按件计酬。对每个社员的劳动都按工作定额和报酬标准计算，就可以准确地实现“同工同酬”。
