Old Man Baishi Living in a Great Era
    Hu Peheng

    "If Baishi lives to be ninety but becomes blind and his fingers stiff, unable to paint, he will starve to death!"

    This is a heartfelt statement from a letter Old Man Baishi wrote to me thirty years ago (1926). From this sentence, one can see the old society's attitude towards artists, and Old Man Baishi's resentful feelings towards the society at that time.

    After the Xinhai Revolution, in the early years of the Republic of China, it was a time of warlord strife and widespread suffering. Old Man Baishi deeply experienced the hardships of the people in the countryside. In the self-narration of "Baishi's Poetry Drafts," he said:

    "The following year, Wu-wu (note: 1918, when Baishi was fifty-eight years old), a relative lived at the foot of Zijing Mountain, a very remote place with a few thatched houses. Fortunately, we lived separately to eke out a living, still afraid of being discovered. So, I swallowed my voice in the weeds, slept on dewy grass at night, and ate under the shade of green pines in the morning. It was hot, my skin was red with sweat, and green mosquitoes and flies feasted on me. Wild foxes and rats were my neighbors. After a year like this, my bones were as thin as withered firewood. What I had more than withered firewood were my eyes, looking around in fright, my pupils bright and moving."

    At this time, Old Man Baishi settled in Beijing to avoid the chaos. He was very concerned about national affairs, and every time we talked about these issues, he was very passionate and indignant. I remember in 1926, I painted a long scroll of the motherland's landscape and asked him to look at it. Moved by the scene, he inscribed two quatrains:

    "Layers distinct, brushstrokes meticulous, inspiring the mind, showing skill. In future painting circles, three thousand strong, each must remember this old man."

    "Facing your scroll, I feel for those years, a broken golden bowl, how pitiful the world! Under the lamp, weeping again and again, China has no such complete landscape."

    He compared the country to a "golden bowl," and he wept for the fragmentation of the country's mountains and rivers, fully expressing his patriotic thoughts. I was also very moved by his poem at the time, and later I printed this poem in front of my collection of paintings to awaken people's love for the motherland.

    After settling in Beijing, Old Man Baishi made a living by selling paintings and seal carvings. At that time, the old society treated artists with great contempt, and at the same time, they did not understand Old Man Baishi's realistic works, so he was very distressed. At that time, he painted a portrait of a poor laborer and sent it to my home, with the inscription:

    "Having exhausted effort in refining, it finally becomes a grain of cinnabar; in the eyes of ordinary worldly people, it looks like the body of a starving man!"

    He meant that he was a poor laborer, and his art was refined through decades of labor. Unfortunately, the old society not only did not understand him but also looked down on him. This poem fully revealed the old man's resentment towards the old society at that time.

    Old Man Baishi endured such suffering through the eras ruled by several reactionary governments, and finally, he looked forward to the victory of the people's revolution.

    Growing up in this great era has truly made this outstanding people's artist complete, and it is possible for his works to be widely in contact with the people at home and abroad. The people love his realistic works and gave him high honor. In 1953, the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government awarded him an honorary certificate, calling him "an outstanding artist of the Chinese people." Later, he was elected as a representative of the First National People's Congress, and he also received the honorary certificate of Corresponding Academician of the Academy of Arts of the German Democratic Republic. This year, he was awarded the International Peace Prize of 1955 by the World Peace Council, enjoying the highest honor in the world.

    Growing up in this great era, the old man has endless joy. He deeply realized that only in this era can he dedicate his art to the people and contribute to the cause of defending world peace. Therefore, in 1954, he said in his letter to the Northeast Museum: "Old Baishi lives in a prosperous age. The love of people at home and abroad for my paintings should be thanked to Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party for their advocacy and concern for this art."

    Old Man Baishi is ninety-six years old this year. When we look back at the first few sentences of this article, we will better appreciate the happiness of living in this new society today.

    生活在伟大时代的白石老人
    胡佩衡
    “白石倘九十不死，目瞎指硬，不能作画，生计死矣！”
    这是白石老人在三十年前（1926年）给我写的信札中的一句心里话。从这句话里，可以看出旧社会对待艺术家的态度。和白石老人对当时社会愤愤不满的心情。
    辛亥革命以后，民国之初，正是军阀混战，民不聊生的年代，白石老人在农村深深体验到当时人民的疾苦。他在“白石诗草”自叙中说：
      “越明年戊午（注：1918年白石五十八岁），有戚人居紫荆山下，地甚僻，茅屋数间，幸与分居，同为偷活，犹恐人知。遂吞声草莽之中，夜宿露草之上，朝餐苍松之阴。时值炎热，赤肤汗流，绿蚊苍蝇共食，野狐穴鼠为邻。如是一年，骨与枯柴同瘦，所有胜于枯柴者，尚多两目，惊怖四顾，目睛莹然而能动也。”
    这时白石老人为避乱而定居北京。当时老人非常关心国家大事，我们每次谈到这些问题时，他都非常激昂愤慨。记得在1926年我画了一幅祖国山川风景长卷请他看，老人见景生情，并刻题两首绝句：
      “层次分明点画工，启人心事见毫锋。他年画苑三千辈，个个毋忘念此翁。”
      “对君斯册感当年，撞破金瓯世可怜！灯下再三挥泪看，中华无此整山川。”
    他把国家比作“金瓯”，他为国家山河的破碎而流泪，充分地表现了爱国的思想。我当时也很为他的诗所感动，以后我就把这首诗印在我的画集前面，以唤起人们爱祖国的情绪。
    定居北京后，老人以卖画和篆刻为生活，当时旧社会里对待艺术家非常轻视，同时对白石老人现实主义的作品也不了解，因而老人非常苦闷。那时，他曾画一张贫苦劳动者像送给我家，上面题道：
      “尽了功夫烧炼，方成一粒丹砂；人世凡夫眼界，看作饿殍身家！”
    他的意思是说，他是一个贫苦劳动者，他的艺术是经过几十年劳动提炼而成的，可惜旧社会里不但不了解他，并且还轻视他。这首诗里充分流露了老人对当时旧社会的心绪愤愤。
    白石老人就是这样痛苦地熬过了几个反动政府统治的时代，终久盼到了人民革命的胜利。
    生长在这个伟大的时代，才真正成全了这位杰出的人民艺术家，才可能使他的作品广泛地和中外人民接触。人民热爱他的现实主义作品，给了他崇高的荣誉。1953年中央人民政府文化部授给他荣誉奖状，称他为“中国人民杰出的艺术家”，以后，被选为第一届全国人民代表大会的代表，又获得德意志民主共和国艺术科学院通讯院士荣誉状，今年又获得了世界和平理事会授与他1955年度的国际和平奖金，享有世界最高的荣誉。
    生长在这个伟大时代，老人有说不尽的高兴。他深深体会到，只有在这个时代，才可能把艺术供献给人民，才能为保卫世界和平的事业献出力量。因此在1954年他给东北博物馆的信中说：“白石老年，身逢盛世。国内外人士对余画之喜爱，应感谢毛主席与中国共产党对此道之倡导与关怀。”
    白石老人今年已经九十六岁了，我们再回头看看这篇文章开头的那几句话，就会更加体会到我们生在今天这个新社会的幸福。
