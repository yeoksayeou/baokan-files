The Ministry of Railways Takes Measures to Rush Passengers and Goods

    This newspaper reports: In order to alleviate the transportation congestion along the Baoji-Lanzhou Railway, the Ministry of Railways formulated "Emergency Measures to Eliminate Congestion on the Baoji-Lanzhou Line" on September 5th and held a national railway telephone conference on the same day. The measures stipulate that the ongoing reconstruction of the Baoji-Lanzhou Railway will be suspended for fifteen days starting from September 8th. During this period, five additional temporary passenger trains and eight freight trains can be added daily from Baoji, increasing the transportation capacity of the Baoji-Lanzhou Railway by more than one-third.
    To help the Lanzhou Railway Bureau overcome the difficulties caused by the increased volume of traffic and the resulting shortage of manpower and resources, railway departments in various regions are continuously transferring locomotives and crew members to Lanzhou. By September 7th, the Zhengzhou and Beijing Railway Bureaus had transferred seven locomotives and ninety crew members. The Shanghai and Jinzhou Railway Bureaus also transferred large cranes and power generating cars.
    Also reported: In August, due to the congestion on the Baoji-Lanzhou Railway, more than seven thousand passengers were stranded in Shanghai, Dalian, Changchun, Harbin and other places. These passengers were technical workers urgently needed to support the construction of the Northwest, students who graduated this summer, and family members of workers. After the Ministry of Railways took emergency measures, eight long-distance temporary passenger trains were organized from Shanghai, Changchun, Dalian, Harbin and other places starting from August 31st, directly to Lanzhou. By September 5th, all stranded passengers had been transported. (People's Railway News Editorial Department)

Harbin Mobilizes Transportation Capacity to Support Basic Construction

    According to the Harbin Daily: The Harbin City Support Basic Construction Transportation Working Group was established on August 31st. This working group is composed of sixteen cadres drawn from five units, including the Basic Construction Department of the Harbin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Municipal People's Committee, and the Northeast Third Engineering Company of the Ministry of Construction Engineering.
    Due to the impact of flood control, a large amount of construction materials are stockpiled at production units and railway special lines, unable to be transported to construction sites in time. By the end of August, more than 562,000 tons of various construction materials were stockpiled on railway special lines in the city and suburbs, leaving construction sites in a state of suspension awaiting materials.
    Since the establishment of the transportation working group, it will uniformly dispatch the city's transportation capacity to solve the transportation blockage as soon as possible. At present, twenty-seven heavy-duty trucks have been transferred from factories, enterprises, government agencies and schools to construction sites to transport red bricks. It is planned to mobilize more than one thousand vehicles in September to take on the task of transporting construction materials to construction sites. Leading cadres of most units in Harbin City also attach great importance to supporting basic construction work, and have come to the working group to report on the vehicles that their units can transfer. Some units took the initiative to request difficult tasks. The Harbin Cigarette Factory also selected the best heavy-duty trucks to support basic construction.

Chengdu Military Region Provides Automotive Support to the Sichuan-Shaanxi Highway

    Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 8th: In order to assist in the rush transport of passengers delayed on the Sichuan-Shaanxi Highway and accumulated goods awaiting transport, the Chengdu Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army has contacted the Sichuan Provincial Department of Transportation and decided to send one hundred vehicles to participate in this emergency transportation work. The motor transport unit will depart for Baoji on the 10th, first rushing to transport daily necessities and gasoline closely related to the lives of the people of Sichuan and Tibet. The logistics department of the Chengdu Military Region has also sent a group of officers to set up stations along the Sichuan-Shaanxi Highway to guide the smooth progress of the transport mission.
    Prior to this, the Chengdu Military Region Motor Transport Unit had dispatched seventy vehicles to support the Kangding-Tibet Highway transportation department, transporting two hundred tons of materials to Ganzi. These vehicles are currently en route and will be put into the work of supporting the Sichuan-Shaanxi Highway after returning.

Huhhot Cars Implement Two-Shift Transportation

    Xinhua News Agency, Huhhot, 8th: One-third of the trucks in Huhhot City have been operating on two shifts since the 7th. Most of these vehicles were recently allocated from the central government.
    The joint group composed of personnel from the transportation, production, and construction departments of Huhhot City is specifically leading the implementation of the two-shift system for vehicles. They are urging relevant departments to repair the roads at basic construction sites, install night transportation lighting equipment, and specifically arrange the maintenance of vehicles and the training and allocation of new drivers. Now, loading and unloading workers in brick, tile, sand and stone production departments and construction sites have also implemented a two-shift work system to ensure loading and unloading upon arrival to improve transportation turnover rate.
    The scale of construction projects in Huhhot City this year is very large, and a shortage of transportation capacity has been felt for a long time. After one-third of the city's vehicles implement a two-shift system, the problem of insufficient transportation capacity will be basically solved.

    动员各方面力量，解除运输紧张状态
    铁道部采取措施抢运旅客和货物
    本报讯　为了解除宝兰铁路沿线的运输堵塞状态，铁道部在9月5日制定了“消除宝兰线堵塞的紧急措施”，并在当天召开了全国铁路电话会议。这个措施规定，正在进行改建的宝兰铁路将从9月8日起暂停施工十五天，在这个期间，每天就可以从宝鸡增开五列临时旅客列车和八列货物列车，使目前宝兰铁路的运输能力提高三分之一以上。
    为了帮助兰州铁路管理局克服因运量增加而产生人力物力不足的困难，现在各地铁路部门正源源不断地把许多机车和乘务人员等调到兰州去，到9月7日，郑州和北京两个铁路管理局已调去七台机车和九十名乘务人员；上海铁路管理局和锦州铁路管理局也调去了大型吊车和发电车。
    又讯　8月间，因宝兰铁路运输堵塞，滞留在上海、大连、长春、哈尔滨等地的旅客达七千人以上，这些旅客都是急需去兰州支援西北建设的技术工人、今年暑假毕业的学生以及工人家属等。经铁道部采取紧急措施，从8月31日起由上海、长春、大连、哈尔滨等地组织了直达兰州的长途临时旅客列车八列。到9月5日，已把滞留的旅客全部输送完毕。　（人民铁道报编辑部）
    哈市动员运输力量支援基本建设工作
    据哈尔滨日报消息　哈尔滨市支援基本建设运输工作组，已于8月31日成立。这个工作组是由中共哈尔滨市委基本建设部、市人民委员会、建筑工程部东北第三工程公司等五个单位，抽调了十六名干部组成的。
    哈尔滨各基本建设工地，由于受防汛影响，大批建筑材料积压在生产单位和铁路专运线，不能及时运到工地使用。到8月末为止，在市内和市郊各个铁路专运线积压的各种建筑材料，达五十六万二千余吨，使工地处于停工待料状态。
    自从运输工作组成立后，将统一调度全市运输力量，尽快解决运输堵塞问题。目前已从工厂企业、机关学校抽调了二十七辆载重汽车，开到工地运输红砖；计划9月份动员一千余辆汽车到工地担任建筑材料运输任务。哈尔滨市大部分单位的领导干部，对支援基本建设工作也很重视，纷纷到工作组来报告本单位能够抽调的车辆。有的单位主动要求艰巨任务。哈尔滨卷烟厂还挑选了最好的载重汽车支援基本建设。
    成都军区汽车支援川陕公路
    新华社成都8日电　为了协助抢运耽搁在川陕公路上的旅客和积压待运的物资，中国人民解放军成都军区已经同四川省交通厅取得联系，决定派出一百辆汽车参加这一紧急的运输工作。汽车部队将在10日开赴宝鸡，首先抢运和四川、西藏人民生活密切有关的日用必需品和汽油。成都军区后勤部门还派出一批军官在川陕公路沿途设立场站，指导运输任务的顺利进行。
    在这以前，成都军区汽车部队已出动七十辆汽车支援康藏公路运输部门，把二百吨物资运往甘孜。目前这些车辆尚在途中，返回后也将投入支援川陕公路抢运的工作。
    呼和浩特汽车实行两班运输
    新华社呼和浩特8日电　呼和浩特市有三分之一的载重汽车，已经从7日起实行两班运输。这些车辆大部分是新近从中央调拨来的。
    呼和浩特市由运输、生产和建筑部门派人组成的联合小组，正在具体领导车辆两班制的实行。他们督促有关部门修整基本建设施工现场的道路，安装夜间运输照明设备，并且具体安排了车辆的保养和新司机的训练、配备等工作。现在，砖瓦砂石等生产部门和建筑工地的装卸职工，也实行了两班工作的制度，保证随到随装，随卸随收，以提高运输周转率。
    呼和浩特市今年建设工程的规模很大，很早以来就感到运输力量不足，全市三分之一的车辆实行两班制后，运输力不足的问题将基本上得到解决。
