    Experiences in Transforming Capitalist Industry and Commerce and Capitalists
    Speech by Comrade Huang Huoqing, First Secretary of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party
    I fully agree with the reports of Comrades Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, and Deng Xiaoping.
    Now I will only talk about some practical experiences in Tianjin's peaceful transformation of capitalist industry and commerce and capitalists.
    After the liberation of Tianjin, we began to implement the policy of utilization, restriction, and transformation of capitalist industry and commerce as stipulated by the Party Central Committee. First of all, we vigorously implemented the policy of "both public and private benefit" and "both labor and capital benefit," which stabilized many capitalists from wavering, hesitating, and panicking, and enabled them to continue production and management, which was conducive to the restoration of the severely damaged national economy. To this end, in labor-capital relations, we persuaded workers not to demand excessive wages and benefits, adopted many measures to stabilize the turbulent labor-capital relations, and established labor order within private enterprises. In public-private relations, the state provided certain considerations in the purchase of raw materials to help private factories solve difficulties so that production could proceed smoothly and reduce unemployment; provided loans to households with difficulties; and the state purchased important products with poor sales. At the same time, we also began to struggle against the destructive aspects of capitalism. The first was to crack down on the speculative activities of capitalist commerce, especially focusing on cracking down on the speculative activities of grain and yarn merchants. Secondly, state-owned commerce began to control the main materials. In early 1950 alone, yarn, cloth, grain, salt, coal, etc. were all or basically controlled by the state. At the same time, the processing, ordering, and exclusive sales and purchases of capitalist industry began. In 1949, the output value of processing, ordering, exclusive sales, and purchases in Tianjin accounted for 19.76 percent of the total output value of private industry, which increased to 37.23 percent in 1950. Private yarn factories have all been processing for the state, and 98 percent of cloth production is controlled by the state, and 90 percent of the flour industry is also processing for the state. Thirdly, some industries harmful to the national economy and people's livelihood were eliminated, and private banks and money shops specializing in speculative business were banned. Then, all private banks were transformed into joint state-private enterprises, so that banking was completely unified under the leadership of the State Bank. Through the above work, coupled with the fact that the main economic lifelines, such as important factories, mines, power, and transportation, were in the hands of the state, the leading position of the state-owned economy was rapidly established. From then on, the capitalist economy could not be as unrestricted and rampant as it was before national liberation, but had to obey our management and carry out legal activities within the track stipulated by the national economic plan.
    State capitalism forms such as processing, ordering, exclusive sales, and purchases, from 1950 onwards, have gradually become the main forms for us to utilize, restrict, and transform capitalist industry and commerce. But at that time, many capitalists were unwilling to accept this restriction. Their general rule for dealing with processing and ordering is that they are willing to accept processing and ordering only when products are sluggish and raw materials are difficult to obtain; once products sell well and raw materials are not difficult, they hope to get rid of processing and ordering and pursue high profits in the free market. The reasons why they had to accept processing and ordering are: (1) the strength and superiority of the state-owned economy; (2) due to the development of supply and marketing cooperatives, the commercial organizations of the peasants themselves, the activities of private industry and commerce in rural areas were subject to certain restrictions; (3) the main materials were controlled by the state; (4) state-owned industry and commerce had high prestige among the masses, and private industry and commerce had a bad reputation among the masses. Under these conditions, it is difficult for capitalists to operate and develop without contacting the state-owned economy and relying on the leadership and support of the state-owned economy. Obviously, processing and ordering created favorable conditions for the transformation of the capitalist economy.
    The "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements in 1952 gave a concentrated blow to the destructive nature of the bourgeoisie's opposition to restriction and opposition to leadership, banned those parts of capitalist industry and commerce that were harmful and unprofitable or more harmful than beneficial, and protected those parts that were beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood and patriotic and law-abiding. The capitalists realized that developing industry and commerce that is beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood under the management of the People's Government, the leadership of the state-owned economy, and the organized supervision of the working class is their correct path.
    After the general line was announced in 1953, it was more clearly stipulated that capitalist industry and commerce should be transformed through state capitalism. On the one hand, the Party educated capitalists to accept socialist transformation; on the other hand, it planned to expand joint state-private ownership in industry and continued to expand processing and ordering. In commerce, the state gradually controlled almost all wholesale commerce and expanded distribution and agency sales; at the same time, it implemented unified purchase and sales and developed the cooperative movement in rural areas; and urban handicraft laborers were also gradually organized. All this not only strengthened the leading position of the socialist economy, but also severed the links between capitalist industry and commerce, between factories, and between the capitalist economy and the small-scale production economy to a large extent. This prepared favorable conditions for the high tide of socialist transformation.
    By the second half of 1955, we had greatly expanded the socialist front economically. The total output value of joint state-private factories accounted for 44.18 percent of the total output value of the original private industry. In the remaining private industry, the output value of processing, ordering, exclusive sales, and purchases accounted for 87 percent. In private commerce, wholesale commerce has basically been eliminated. State-owned retail commerce accounted for 44 percent, and private commerce accounted for 56 percent. In this part of private commerce, the sales volume of agency sales, distribution, and wholesale purchases accounted for 62 percent. At this time, the enterprises that had already been jointly operated had demonstrated their superiority in production, the capitalists' profits were guaranteed, and jobs were arranged; while the private enterprises that had not embarked on the road of state capitalism had many contradictions that could not be resolved and felt great difficulties. This pointed out a clear direction for the bourgeoisie.
    At this time, a high tide of agricultural cooperativization appeared across the country, and the political consciousness and organization of the working masses in capitalist enterprises were greatly improved. The children of capitalists made great progress under the education of the new society and youth mass organizations. They were ashamed to continue living the life of the exploiting class, and some even refused to accept the stocks or inheritance rights given to them by their parents. This was a great stimulus to the capitalists. The wives of the capitalists also made considerable progress under the education of women's mass organizations. The capitalists themselves, after several years of life practice and political study, also greatly improved their patriotism and political consciousness. Under this situation, the Party proposed to advance the transformation of capitalist industry and commerce to a new stage, that is, from the original stage of mainly processing, ordering, distribution, agency sales, and the implementation of joint state-private ownership in some large enterprises, to the stage of implementing joint state-private ownership and fixed interest in all important industries. This is a decisive stage. The capitalist ownership has undergone a fundamental change. The remaining problems in the future are only to abolish the fixed interest and realize nationalization when conditions are ripe, to transform the capitalists into self-reliant working citizens, and to transform enterprises from the perspective of production. We believe that after persuasion and education to raise the awareness of the capitalists, it is expected that the final elimination of capitalist ownership will be relatively easy. As for the struggle against the residual ideas of the bourgeoisie, it is of course a long-term and arduous task.
    In the process of socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, we combined the transformation of enterprises with the transformation of people. While transforming enterprises, we adopted active educational methods for capitalists, organized them to participate in political theory study, participate in social and political movements, and guided them to conduct criticism and self-criticism within the capitalist class. At the same time, we made proper arrangements for the representative figures among the capitalists in terms of work and political status. Some served as factory directors and managers, some served as people's representatives, and some served as deputy district heads and deputy mayors. However, the process of capitalists accepting education and transformation was not without twists and turns. In the early days of liberation, some people attempted to "divide the court and share the spoils" with us, asking us not to "compete with the people for profit," advocating that we engage in heavy industry and the bourgeoisie engage in light industry. Some also wanted to take the middle road, not recognizing the leadership of our Party and the working class. However, after the three major movements of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, land reform, and suppressing counter-revolutionaries, great political changes took place. At the beginning of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, some people were originally wavering and nervous. However, when they saw the victory of the war and defeated American imperialism, they generally received a profound education and strengthened their patriotic ideology. The "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements politically exposed the ugly nature of the bourgeoisie, drew a clear line between the working class and the bourgeoisie within the working class, further established the political advantage of the working class, and greatly weakened the influence of the bourgeoisie in society. At the same time, due to the vigorous development of the socialist economy and its increasing superiority; the whole country was under construction, and a prosperous atmosphere was everywhere; China's international status was unprecedentedly improved. Most capitalists could not help but feel something in their hearts in the face of this situation. Since then, a group of patriotic and law-abiding elements gradually emerged among them. From 1953 to 1954, we vigorously carried out the propaganda of the general line of the transition period, explaining that socialism is the general trend and the aspiration of the people, and it is impossible not to take this path. At this time, many capitalists saw the future of the country and themselves, actively accepted socialist transformation, and played a leading role, a backbone role, and a bridge role in the business community. Some people said, "It is better to drink a toast than to drink a penalty drink," and some backward elements also became divided. Most bourgeois elements expressed their willingness to make contributions to socialist transformation. Especially under the impetus of the high tide of socialist transformation of agriculture across the country, when joint state-private ownership was implemented in all industries, many people said that they had "lost heart" in capitalism and "made up their minds" about socialism. Therefore, they welcomed the transformation with gongs and drums; worked actively during the asset inventory; and after the joint operation of the entire industry, they were generally able to perform their duties and responsibilities. More than 30,000 people actively participated in the competition, and more than 1,100 people were rated as advanced producers and advanced workers. It can be imagined that as long as we persist in implementing the policy of actively transforming bourgeois elements and adopt a correct attitude, the vast majority of bourgeois elements can be transformed into actively working and self-reliant working citizens in the future.
    In order to correctly implement the policy of utilization, restriction, and transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, we have also carried out many struggles against "left" and right deviations within the Party and the working class in recent years. In the early days of liberation, because most of the cadres came from rural areas, there were "left" leaning emotions that equated the bourgeoisie with the landlord class, as well as the erroneous view of unilaterally seeking welfare for workers without considering production conditions. The anger accumulated by the working masses due to years of oppression often formed spontaneous struggles, demanding excessively high labor treatment and prematurely eliminating capitalist ownership. After the "Five-Anti" movement, some cadres developed a mentality of rather being "left" than right towards the bourgeoisie, emphasizing struggle and ignoring unity. State-owned commerce and cooperative commerce advanced too quickly and violently. The requirements in processing and ordering were too high and too strict. After the general line was announced, the state-owned commerce also had the shortcoming of advancing too quickly. The Party took timely measures to correct these tendencies, and adjusted the relationship between public and private and labor-capital relations several times in the course of advancement, so that capitalist industry and commerce could exist and develop within the scope prescribed by us. Rightist tendencies have also occurred. In the period before the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, our cadres mainly paid attention to encouraging the enthusiasm of the bourgeoisie, developing production, and prospering the economy. They were not vigilant enough about the influence of the bourgeoisie on us, so that a few comrades were corrupted by the bourgeoisie. In 1953, when state-owned commerce unilaterally implemented the economic accounting system, it abandoned its position too much, allowing private wholesale commerce to take advantage of it. These deviations were corrected once discovered under the leadership of the central government. Obviously, without the strong Marxist-Leninist leadership of the Party Central Committee, timely discovery and resolute correction of these "left" and right deviations, our transformation of capitalism would not have achieved such a great victory.
    The above facts show that the Party's determination to eliminate capitalist ownership is unwavering, but the method is peaceful, and the specific struggles in the middle are complex, tortuous, and sharp. Because we have a strong state power, have established a strong state-owned economy in a leading position, and have established a strong and consolidated alliance of workers and peasants, we are fully capable of choosing the most favorable time and using the most favorable method to eliminate capitalist ownership step by step. If we replace policy with emotion and eliminate it prematurely or by simple administrative orders, it will cause economic losses, increase the resistance of bourgeois elements to accept transformation, increase the number of unemployed people in society, and cause social fluctuations. Our method is gradual transition, gradual transformation, unity and struggle, education-oriented, and taking advantage of the situation, so that bourgeois elements have no way out other than accepting peaceful transformation. It can now be affirmed that when nationalization is realized in the future, it can truly be achieved to the point where conditions are ripe and success is assured. For such an exploiting class, we have utilized it and transformed it; we must transform it, and we can also gain its support. After the transformation, we must also make them work actively, turning many possible negative factors into positive factors. This is a creative application of Marxism-Leninism under China's specific conditions. This is a great victory for Marxism-Leninism.

### 对改造资本主义工商业和资本家的体会

    对改造资本主义工商业和资本家的体会
    中共天津市委员会第一书记　黄火青同志的发言
    我完全同意刘少奇、周恩来、邓小平三位同志的报告。
    现在我仅就天津市和平改造资本主义工商业和资本家的问题，讲一些实际体会。
    天津市解放以后，我们对资本主义工商业就开始执行党中央所规定的利用、限制和改造的政策。首先是大力贯彻执行“公私兼顾”和“劳资两利”的政策，把许多资本家从动摇、犹豫、恐慌中安定下来，继续维持生产和经营，以利于恢复遭到严重破坏的国民经济。为此，在劳资关系上，我们说服了工人对工资、福利不要要求过高，采取很多措施稳定了动荡的劳资关系，建立了私营企业内部的劳动秩序。在公私关系上，国家为了帮助私营工厂解决困难，使生产能够顺利进行，使社会减少失业，在购买原料上给以一定的照顾；对困难户给以贷款；对销路不畅的重要产品由国家收购。同时，我们也开始了对资本主义的破坏性方面的斗争。首先是打击资本主义商业的投机活动，特别是着重地打击了粮食和纱布商人的投机活动。其次是国营商业开始掌握了主要物资，仅在一九五○年初，纱、布、粮食、盐、煤等就已全部或基本上控制在国家手中。同时也开始了对资本主义工业的加工、订货和包销收购。一九四九年天津市加工、订货、包销、收购产值占私营工业总产值的百分之十九点七六，一九五○年即增至百分之三十七点二三。私营纱厂已经全部给国家加工，布的产量有百分之九十八控制在国家手上，面粉业也有百分之九十为国家加工。再次是，淘汰了一些对国计民生有害的行业，取缔了专营投机生意的私营银号、钱庄，继而对全部私营银行实行公私合营，使银行事业完全统一在国家银行的领导之下。通过以上这些工作，再加上主要的经济命脉，如重要的厂矿、电力、交通等都掌握在国家手中，国营经济的领导地位迅速地树立了起来。从此资本主义经济就不能像在全国解放以前那样不受限制、任意泛滥，而不得不服从我们的管理，在国家经济计划规定的轨道之内进行合法的活动。
    加工、订货、包销、收购等国家资本主义形式，从一九五○年起，已开始逐渐成为我们利用、限制和改造资本主义工商业的主要形式。但在当时，许多资本家不甘心接受这种限制。他们对付加工订货的一般规律是，在产品滞销和原料来源困难的情况下，他们才愿意接受加工订货；一到产品畅销和原料不困难的时候，他们就希望摆脱加工订货，而去追求自由市场的高额利润。他们之所以不得不接受加工订货，是因为：（1）国营经济的强大及其优越性；（2）由于农民自己的商业组织供销合作社的发展，使私营工商业在农村的活动受到了一定的限制；（3）主要物资控制在国家手上；（4）国营工商业在群众中威信很高，私营工商业在群众中信誉不好。在这些条件下，资本家如果不和国营经济发生联系，不依靠国营经济的领导和支持就很难活动和发展。很明显，加工订货为改造资本主义经济创造了有利的条件。
    一九五二年的“三反”运动和“五反”运动，对资产阶级反限制、反领导的破坏性给了一次集中的打击，取缔了资本主义工商业中那些有害无利或害多利少的部分，保护了那些有利于国计民生和爱国守法的部分。使资本家认识到只有在人民政府的管理、国营经济的领导和工人阶级的有组织的监督下，发展有利于国计民生的工商业，才是他们正确的道路。
    一九五三年总路线公布以后，更明确规定了经过国家资本主义来改造资本主义工商业的方针。党一方面教育资本家接受社会主义改造；一方面在工业上有计划地扩展公私合营，并且继续扩大加工、订货，在商业上，国家逐步地掌握了差不多是全部的批发商业，扩大了经销、代销；同时在农村中实行了统购统销和发展了合作化运动；城市手工业独立劳动者也逐步组织起来。这一切不但加强了社会主义经济的领导地位，而且使资本主义的工业和商业之间，工厂和工厂之间以及资本主义经济和小生产经济之间的联系在很大程度上被割断了。这就为社会主义改造的高潮准备了有利的条件。
    到了一九五五年下半年，我们已经在经济上大大地扩展了社会主义的阵地。公私合营的工厂的生产总值已占到原有私营工业总产值的百分之四十四点一八。在剩下的私营工业中，加工、订货、包销、收购部分的产值已占到百分之八十七。在私营商业中批发商业已基本消灭。零售商业中国营已占百分之四十四，私营占百分之五十六，在这一部分私营商业中，代销、经销、批购的销货额又占到百分之六十二。这时，已经合营的企业在生产上发挥了优越性，资本家的利润有了保证，工作有了安排；而没有走上国家资本主义道路的私营企业则有许多矛盾不能解决，感到很大困难。这就给资产阶级指出了一个明显的方向。
    这时在全国出现了农业合作化的高潮，同时资本主义企业中的工人群众的政治觉悟和组织程度有了极大的提高。资本家的儿女在新社会和青年群众组织的教育下，有很大的进步，他们耻于继续过剥削阶级的生活，有的甚至拒绝接受父母给他们的股票或财产继承权。这对资本家们是一个很大的刺激。资本家的妻子，在妇女群众组织的教育下，也有相当的进步。资本家本身，经过几年的生活实践和政治学习，爱国心和政治觉悟也有了很大的提高。在这种形势下，党提出把对资本主义工商业改造的工作推进到一个新的阶段，即从原来主要是加工、订货、经销、代销和若干大企业实行公私合营的阶段，推进到在一切重要的行业中，实行全行业公私合营和定息的阶段。这是一个具有决定性的阶段，资本主义所有制至此已起了根本的变化。今后剩下的问题，只是在条件成熟的时候取消定息、实现国有化，把资本家改造成为自食其力的劳动公民，以及从生产上改造企业等问题了。我们相信，经过说服教育，提高资本家的觉悟，预料将来最后消灭资本主义所有制就是比较容易的了。至于和资产阶级残余思想作斗争当然还是长期的艰苦的工作。
    我们在对资本主义工商业进行社会主义改造的过程中，是把企业的改造和人的改造工作结合进行的。在企业改造的同时，对资本家采取积极的教育方法，组织他们参加政治理论学习、参加社会政治运动，并且引导资本家内部进行批评和自我批评。同时在工作上、政治地位上对资本家中有代表性的人物给以妥善的安排，有的作了厂长、经理，有的作了人民代表，还有的作了副区长，副市长。但是，资本家接受教育改造的过程，并不是没有曲折的。解放初期，有些人企图和我们“分庭抗礼，平分秋色”，要我们不要
  “与民争利”，主张我们搞重工业，资产阶级搞轻工业。也有的想搞中间路线，不承认我们党和工人阶级的领导。但是在抗美援朝、土地改革、镇压反革命三大运动以后，政治上发生了很大的变化。抗美援朝开始的时候，有些人原来是动摇的，紧张的，及至看到战争胜利，打败了美国帝国主义，一般也都受到了深刻的教育，增强了爱国主义思想。“三反”“五反”运动在政治上揭穿了资产阶级的丑恶本质，在工人阶级内部划清了和资产阶级的界限，进一步树立了工人阶级在政治上的优势，在社会上也极大地削弱了资产阶级的影响。同时，由于社会主义经济蓬勃发展并日益显示其优越性；全国都在建设，到处呈现一片兴旺气象；中国的国际地位空前提高，绝大多数资本家面对着这种情况，内心里也不能不有所感受。自此以后，在他们中间逐渐出现了一批爱国守法的分子。一九五三年到一九五四年，我们大张旗鼓地进行了过渡时期总路线的宣传，说明社会主义是大势所趋，人心所向，不走不行。这时资本家中有许多人看清了国家和自己的前途，积极接受社会主义改造，在工商界中起着带头作用、骨干作用和桥梁作用。有些人则表示“吃罚酒，不如吃敬酒”，一部分落后分子也发生了分化。大多数资产阶级分子纷纷表示愿意在社会主义改造中立功。特别是在全国农业社会主义改造高潮的推动下实行全行业公私合营时，许多人表示对资本主义“死了心了”，对社会主义“定了心了”。因此，他们敲锣打鼓地欢迎改造；在清产核资时，积极工作；在全行业合营以后，一般的都能够守职尽责。有三万多人积极参加了竞赛，并且有一千一百多人被评为先进生产者和先进工作者。可以设想，只要我们对资产阶级分子坚持执行积极改造的方针和采取正确的态度，绝大部分资产阶级分子将来都可以改造成为积极工作的、自食其力的劳动公民。
    为了正确地贯彻执行对资本主义工商业利用、限制和改造的政策，几年来我们在党和工人阶级内部也曾进行了多次的反“左”反右的斗争。在解放初期，因为干部多数是从农村来的，存在着把资产阶级等同于地主阶级的“左”倾情绪，以及不看生产条件，片面地为工人谋福利的错误观点。工人群众由于多年受压榨所积成的愤怒，也往往形成了自发的斗争，要求过高地提高劳动待遇和过早地消灭资本主义所有制。在“五反”运动以后，有些干部对资产阶级又产生了宁
  “左”毋右的情绪，强调斗争，忽视团结。国营商业和合作社商业前进速度过快过猛，加工订货中要求过高过严，在总路线公布以后国营商业前进速度也发生过快的缺点。党及时采取措施纠正了这些倾向，在前进中几次调整公私关系和劳资关系，使资本主义工商业在我们规定的范围内能够存在和发展。右的倾向也是发生过的。在“三反”“五反”运动以前的一段时期中，我们的干部主要注意了鼓励资产阶级的积极性，发展生产，繁荣经济，对资产阶级极力影响我们的一面警惕不够，以致有少数同志受到资产阶级的腐蚀。在一九五三年，国营商业在片面执行经济核算制的时候，又过多地放弃了阵地，使私营批发商业占了便宜。这些偏差，在中央领导下一经发现，即作了纠正。很明显，如果没有党中央的坚强的马克思列宁主义的领导，及时发现和坚决纠正这些“左”的和右的偏向，我们对资本主义的改造就不可能取得这样伟大的胜利。
    以上的事实说明党要消灭资本主义所有制是坚定不渝的，但方法是和平的，中间经过的具体斗争是复杂的，曲折的，尖锐的。由于我们有强大的国家政权、建立了坚强的居于领导地位的国营经济，并且建立了强大的巩固的工人和农民的联盟，我们完全有可能选择最有利的时机，用最有利的方法，一步一步地来消灭资本主义所有制。如果以感情代替政策，过早地或用简单的行政命令的方法予以消灭，就会造成经济上的损失，也将会增加资产阶级分子接受改造的阻力，增加社会上的失业群众，造成社会波动。我们的法办是逐步过渡，逐渐改造，又团结、又斗争，教育为主，因势利导，使资产阶级分子除了接受和平改造外，别无出路。现在已经可以肯定，将来实现国有化的时候，真正可以做到瓜熟蒂落，水到渠成的地步。对于这样一个剥削阶级，我们利用了它，又改造了它；既要改造它，又能获得它的拥护，改造以后还要使他们积极工作。把许多可能产生的消极因素都变成积极因素。这是马克思列宁主义在中国具体条件下创造性的应用，这是马克思列宁主义的伟大胜利。
