Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, September 15th. The entire Shanghai Acrobatic Troupe of China, currently visiting Poland, volunteered to participate in the reconstruction of Warsaw on September 14th, using the free time between their busy performances.

During their performance tour in Poland, the Acrobatic Troupe often added matinee performances to meet the audience's demands. When the performers learned that September was the month of voluntary labor for the reconstruction of Warsaw, they decided to personally participate in this glorious work.

At 10:30 a.m. on the 14th, all the members of the Acrobatic Troupe cheerfully arrived at the Central Cultural Park singing songs. Each person shouldered a shovel and immediately went to the construction site to fill in the trenches. In less than half an hour, they leveled a pile of earth about half a meter high and thirty meters long.

During the labor, more than forty actors were divided into two shifts. While one shift worked hard, the other shift sang songs to motivate them: "Our faces are glowing red, our sweat is dripping down, why?" Then someone would answer: "For the construction of Warsaw!"

After two hours of pleasant labor, everyone wiped away their sweat and returned with renewed vigor to prepare for the evening performance.

    “为了建设华沙”
    上海杂技团参加义务劳动
    新华社华沙15日电　正在波兰访问的中国上海杂技团全体人员，9月14日利用紧张演出中的空隙时间志愿参加了重建华沙的义务劳动。
    杂技团在波兰访问演出中为了满足观众的要求常常加演日场。当演员们听说9月是重建华沙的义务劳动月的时候，就决定亲自参加这个光荣的工作。
    14日上午十时半杂技团全体演员们唱着歌欢乐地来到中央文化公园。每人扛上一把铁锹，立刻走向工地去填平土沟。不到半小时，就把一个约高半公尺、长三十公尺的土堆铲平了。
    在劳动过程中，四十多个演员分作两班，一班在紧张地劳动的时候，另一班就唱歌进行鼓动：“我们的脸上发红光，我们的汗珠往下淌，为什么？”这时有人回答道：“为了建设华沙”。
    两个小时的愉快劳动完毕了，大家抹干汗，精神百倍地回去准备晚上的演出。
