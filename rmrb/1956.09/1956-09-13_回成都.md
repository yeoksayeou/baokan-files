    Returning to Chengdu
    Zhang Yan
    For several years, I have cherished a wish: if I have the chance in the future, I must go and see what Chengdu, where I was born, has become.
    This July, that wish finally became a reality. Moreover, the first train after the Baoji-Chengdu Railway was connected carried me there.
    After crossing the Qinling Mountains and passing through the natural barrier of Jianmen Pass, we slid down to the fertile West Sichuan Plain as if on a slide. The train was like a wild horse that had broken free from its reins, running wildly.
    I could hardly contain my excitement, and memories kept flooding back into my mind.
            Heavy Memories
    I recalled the scene when I left Chengdu for the first time more than twenty years ago. At that time, there wasn't even a direct bus for the 500-kilometer journey from Chengdu to Chongqing. We only took a short ride on a dilapidated long-distance bus before switching to a small wooden boat, which took us a full ten days, and we had to go ashore to rest at the docks every night.
    At that time, although Chengdu was already the capital of Sichuan, it only had narrow streets, and most of them were uneven. If it was raining, you could only hear the heavy footsteps of the sedan carriers walking on the muddy road, with mud splashing several feet away. There were no electric lights at that time, and after nightfall, only the dim light of kerosene lamps with six-sided glass shone on the streets.
    At that time, Chengdu, like the entire Sichuan, was divided and occupied by a group of warlords. The warlords fought each other for many years, and the common people rarely had a peaceful day. Sichuan was the richest province in the country, but the vast majority of farmers suffered unspeakable hardships, enduring shocking exploitation and oppression. In 1931, Liu Xiang had already pre-collected taxes from the farmers for the year 1956, twenty-five years in the future! Chengdu became the fortress and money-sucking den for these warlords, landlords, and usurers to implement feudal rule.
    Ten years ago, not long after the end of the Anti-Japanese War, I returned to Chengdu once. At that time, the rulers of Sichuan had long been replaced by Chiang Kai-shek.
    In the teahouses, there were still so many "idle people" who were full all day long. However, there were additional signs on the pillars and walls that read "Adjust your attire and do not discuss state affairs," shrouded in a cloud of terror. At that time, in addition to the original "thugs" such as the "Guard Company of So-and-So's Mansion" who ran rampant, there were also Kuomintang secret agents of various "Unification" departments, who were even higher up. The market was full of American goods.
    When I left Chengdu again in 1946, to be honest, I left with a somewhat pessimistic and disappointed mood. I was thinking: When will Chengdu ever change?
    In December 1949, Chengdu finally changed, and it changed drastically. Chiang Kai-shek was finally driven out of the mainland at the airport here!
    The conductor's shout woke me up from my heavy memories, and I realized that the train had already slowed down and entered the suburbs of Chengdu. My heart began to beat rapidly, and I opened my eyes wide, expecting the Chengdu of today that was about to appear.
          Chengdu People's Pride
    The first impression Chengdu gave me was that it was brand new. The first thing that greeted us was the magnificent railway station. In Chengdu's more than two thousand years of history, it had only had a railway station for four years. Next to the station platform, there was a patch of green lawn planted with eye-catching flowers and trees. As soon as the passengers got off the train, they had a fresh and pleasant feeling.
    Going into the city from the station is a five-kilometer-long tree-lined avenue. Although the eucalyptus trees on both sides are not tall enough yet, they already have a considerable style. Along the way, newly built red brick buildings are converging from the north and south. In the past, this area outside the North Gate, apart from sparse thatched houses dotted in the rice fields, what else was there?
    I jumped on a public bus and headed for Chunxi Road in the city center. This was the first time I had taken a public bus in Chengdu. I learned from the ticket seller that Chengdu's public bus lines only started to be built in 1952. Now, all major roads are accessible by public bus, and there is also a loop line. The public buses travel on newly built or expanded main roads. It made me, a person returning from afar, unable to avoid getting lost. Fortunately, relying on the original street names and many shops that still maintained their original appearance, I slowly connected them with the old Chengdu.
    However, since I had been away for a long time, and the changes were so great, I had to ask an "old Chengdu" to guide me. The two of us ran around every day, covering all the places I wanted to go, and met many new and old friends.
    I found that as long as you talk about the changes in this city, almost every Chengdu person will show off their new roads to you. Indeed, why shouldn't they be proud? Before liberation, for decades, only Chunxi Road was a flat and spacious asphalt road, and it was still built by the "merchants and residents" themselves by raising funds. But in the short six years or so after liberation, the People's Government has renovated roads with a total length of one hundred kilometers. The main streets are now almost all asphalt or cement roads that are ten to twenty meters wide. Some streets have also added street flower beds and planted rows of phoenix trees or hibiscus trees. The most drastic change is probably the old Imperial City Dam area. It used to be a famous slum, full of broken streets and alleys, full of mud, smelly and dirty. Next to it was a so-called "Coal Hill," which was actually a mountain of garbage accumulated over decades. There was also a filthy and smelly "Imperial River" like a "Dragon Beard Ditch." Now, in front of the Imperial City is a surprisingly wide asphalt road – "Renmin South Road," with "Renmin East Road" and "Renmin West Road," more than twenty meters wide, running horizontally on the left and right. Every International Labor Day and National Day, the people of Chengdu gather and celebrate in this road square. The garbage mountain next to it has now become the "People's Stadium," which can accommodate 30,000 people. The "Imperial River" has also been widened and deepened, flowing with clear water drawn from outside the city. When I first walked to the gate of the old Imperial City, I couldn't believe my eyes for a long, long time.
    When the people of Chengdu show off their new roads to you, they will definitely not forget to tell you about the changes under the roads. Less than two months after liberation, the People's Government began to solve the most urgent problem of the sewage system, which was directly related to hundreds of thousands of citizens. Nearly 100,000 people participated in dredging the Jin River and underground ditches, which often flooded in the southern part of the city, and newly built reinforced concrete sewers for 200,000 residents to drain water. Since then, Chengdu has never suffered from floods again. In the past, as long as it rained for two consecutive days, one-third of the city's streets would be flooded, and you had to cross a "bridge" to go out, and this was the case every year.
            Snacks and Scenic Spots
    Chengdu's cuisine, especially its snacks, has always been famous throughout the country. Since the joint state-private ownership of the entire industry this spring, famous restaurants and snack shops have vigorously maintained and promoted their original characteristics, and their business has been better than before. Famous places like "Long Chao Shou," "Lai Tang Yuan," "Jingcheng Garden," "Shiyou Noodles," and "Lychee Lane Dumplings"... often require a long wait before you can get a taste. At the entrances of the restaurants, I can no longer find beggars begging for food. What I see are many restaurants with red posters of good news, which turned out to be commendations from the Federation of Industry and Commerce for their improved work after the joint state-private ownership. One day, while eating at "Jingcheng Garden," I heard about this incident: This large restaurant has a first-class famous chef, Tang Yongqing, who can make more than a thousand kinds of dishes. A single chicken in his hands can produce eighty or ninety kinds of dishes. In the old society, life was pressing, and he was afraid that "teaching apprentices would starve the master," so he always kept his business secrets to himself. After liberation, this old concept had not been eliminated for a while. He always didn't allow people to watch when he was cooking. However, after "Jingcheng Garden" became a joint state-private enterprise, this master seemed to have changed. He was not only jubilant, but also publicly shared his techniques at the conference and promised to teach three apprentices well within half a year.
    In this ancient city, the predecessors left many scenic spots and historical sites with historical significance and artistic value. In the decades before liberation, some of these places were buried and abandoned, and some were even destroyed by the Kuomintang army. In recent years, thanks to the protection and renovation of the People's Government, all these crystals of the wisdom of the ancient people have been restored to their former glory. The "Wuhou Shrine" – the shrine of Zhuge Liang of the Three Kingdoms period, which was already dilapidated before liberation, has not only been restored to its original state, but has also added a large garden that was previously occupied by warlords, becoming a resort for the general public to visit and rest. The "Wangjiang Tower" on the south bank of the Jin River has also been renovated, and the Chongli Pavilion, Yinshi Tower, and Zhuojin Tower, which have been repainted by folk artists, stand tall in the bamboo forest. Especially attractive is the "Du Fu Thatched Cottage," which has been completely renovated and reopened. Now, in front of the former residence of the great Tang Dynasty poet in Chengdu, the trees are lush and the streams meander. After entering the gate, there are groves of Phoebe and plum trees, which set off the Poetry History Hall and Gongbu Shrine commemorating the poet. Walking through the flower path in the east and leaning on the water railing in the west, it is also dotted with green water and red lotus flowers. Here, you can not only feel as if you are in the scene described in Du Fu's poems, but you can also see thousands of volumes of various versions of Du Fu's poems and research works in the newly established exhibition room, and appreciate dozens of paintings of Du Fu's poetic imagery by contemporary famous painters such as Qi Baishi. Standing in front of Du Fu's memorial statue, I couldn't help but recall his "Song of the Thatched Cottage Broken by Autumn Wind." Listen! "If only I could get tens of millions of mansions, to shelter all the poor scholars in the world and make them happy, as safe as a mountain in the wind and rain! Alas, when will this house suddenly appear before my eyes, and I would be satisfied even if I die of freezing in my broken hut!" A patriotic poet with such aspirations, if he were alive today, I wonder how happy he would be!
    All of this, of course, is only a renovation of the old Chengdu. Only after arriving in the industrial construction area in the suburbs did I truly see the brand new Chengdu that is growing vigorously and its bright future.
          The Future Industrial City
    One afternoon, I took a jeep to the northern suburbs, accompanied by Comrade Wang from the Chengdu Urban Construction Committee. After leaving the city, we drove east along the newly built highway. The crisscrossing new roads divided the verdant fields into many squares. Large trucks carrying construction materials shuttled back and forth on these roads. The driver told me that these roads have not even been named yet.
    Smoking chimneys and water towers, from far to near, from small to large. We deliberately slowed down the car and brushed past them. Most of these are new factories that have only recently started production, including a thermal power plant, a railway locomotive repair plant, and three large-scale mechanized brick and tile factories. From the outside, you can tell that they are all of considerable scale. I was just about to ask why so many brick and tile factories were being built when I heard Comrade Wang say:
    "There is another fourth mechanized brick and tile factory under construction ahead, which is even larger than the previous three, and the second modern cutter factory in the country is also under construction here. We are also going to build a "United Housing Processing Plant" consisting of eight factories to provide a large number of "housing parts." These are all to welcome the truly large-scale capital construction that is about to begin. We are only just beginning now."
    Continuing forward, we entered a group of buildings consisting of red brick and yellow tile buildings.
    Here are the factory office buildings and employee dormitories that have already been built; some are schools that have already started classes, and students are playing ball on the playground. Just this year, there are more than ten schools to be built, including telecommunications engineering and geological surveying.
    Connected to these completed buildings are many construction sites with scaffolding erected. Cranes, like the arms of giants, are swaying, and construction materials are everywhere.
    On these lands, cinemas, clubs, department stores, cooperatives, banks... have already appeared. The prototype of a town is already there. In this emerging industrial area, the People's Government has newly built fourteen kilometers of sewers; and a water plant that can supply 120,000 tons of water per day will soon be completed. The newly built roads leading to factories and schools are constantly extending.
    Coming out of this group of buildings, our car drove towards another group of buildings ahead.
    At this time, I suddenly remembered the huge blueprint for Chengdu's construction plan that I saw in the office of the Urban Construction Committee. In that magnificent vision, these new buildings are too insignificant now. By 1962, factories and schools will almost surround the entire urban area layer by layer. Within a range of one or twenty kilometers on the east, north, and south sides, chimneys and high-rise buildings will be as dense as forests, but a gap will be left on the west side as room for development. At that time, there will be many "workers' towns" with 80,000 to 90,000 people each, protecting this huge socialist industrial city like satellites.

专栏：

    回成都
  　张彦
    几年来，我一直存着一个愿望：将来有机会，我一定要去看看那诞生过我的成都变成什么样了。
    今年7月，这个愿望终于变成了现实。而且，是宝成铁路接轨后的第一辆火车把我载送去的。
    翻越秦岭，穿过了剑门天险后，我们像坐滑梯似地滑到了富饶的川西平原上。彩车像脱了缰的野马，放开了步子狂奔。
    我几乎抑制不住自己的兴奋，往事也不断地涌上心头。
            沉重的回忆
    我回忆起二十多年前我第一次离开成都时的情景。那时候，从成都到重庆五百公里的旅程，连直达汽车都没有。我们只坐了一小段破破烂烂的长途汽车，就改搭小木船下去，足足走了十天，每天晚上还得上岸歇码头。
    那时候的成都，虽然早就是四川的首府，但是还只有一条条狭窄的街道，而且大多数是凹凸不平的。如果是下雨天，就只听见肩上抬着人的轿夫走在泥泞路上的沉重的步伐声，泥浆溅得有几尺远。那时候，还没有电灯，入夜以后，街上只有六方玻璃的清油灯闪着黯淡的光辉。
    那时候，成都和整个四川一样，被一群军阀瓜分割据。军阀之间长年混战，老百姓难得过上一天安宁的日子。四川本是全国最富的省份，可是，占人口绝大多数的农民却苦不堪言，受着惊人的剥削和压迫。1931年时，刘湘就已经从农民身上预征了二十五年后的今年——1956年的捐税了！成都，就成为这些军阀、地主、高利贷者实行封建统治的堡垒和锁金窟。
    十年前，抗日战争结束以后不久，我回过成都一次。那时候，四川的统治者早已换成了蒋介石。
    茶馆里，座上还是那么多饱食终日的“闲人”。只是，柱子上和墙壁上增添了“各照衣冠，休谈国事”的字条，笼罩着一层恐怖的乌云。那时候，横行霸道的除了原有的“某公馆警卫连”之类的“歪人”而外，还有比他们更高一等的国民党各种“统”字号的特务。市面上充满了美国的商品。
    当我1946年再度离开成都的时候，说实在的，我是多少带着悲观失望的情绪离开它的。我心里在想：成都什么时候才能变呵？
    1949年12月，成都终于变了，而且是剧烈地变了。在这里的机场上，蒋介石最后被赶出了大陆！
    列车员的喊声把我从沉重的回忆中唤醒过来，我这才发现火车已经放慢步子进入成都市郊了。我的心开始急剧地跳动，我睁大了眼睛期待着就要出现的今天的成都。
          成都人的骄傲
    成都给我的第一个印象就是崭新的。首先迎接我们的是建筑宏伟的火车站，在成都两千多年的历史上，有火车站也才不过是四年前的事情呵。火车站月台旁边一片绿油油的草坪上，种着夺目的花木，旅客一下火车，就有一种清新愉快的感觉。
    从车站进城去是一条五公里长的林荫大道。虽然两边的幽枷利树现在还不够高大，但是已经气派不小了；沿路一幢幢新建的红砖大楼正在从南北会师。从前，北门外这一带，除了稻田里点缀着稀疏的破草房子而外，那还有什么呢？
    我跳上公共汽车往市中心春熙路奔去。这是我第一次在成都坐公共汽车。从售票员那里知道，成都的公共汽车线路是1952年才开始建设的，现在，所有主要干道都通公共汽车，还有一路环行车。公共汽车走过的都是新建的或在扩建的大马路。弄得我这个远方归来人也不能不迷失方向了。幸而靠原有的街名和许多还是保持原来样子的铺面，我才慢慢地把它们和旧成都的面貌联系起来。
    不过，究竟离开的时间长了，又加上变化这么大，我不得不求助于一个“老成都”来给我作向导。我们俩每天东奔西走，跑遍了我所想到的地方，见到了许多新旧友人。
    我发现，只要一谈起这个城市的变化，每一个成都人差不多无例外地都会向你炫耀一番他们的新马路。的确，怎么不值得他们骄傲呢？解放以前，几十年，只有一条春熙路是平坦宽敞的柏油马路，而且还是沿街“商民”自己集资修的；而解放后才短短的六年多，人民政府已经翻修了总长达一百公里的马路，主要街道现在差不多都是十几公尺至二十公尺宽的柏油路或者水泥路了；有的街道还添上了街心花坛，栽种了成行的梧桐树或芙蓉树。变化最剧烈的恐怕要算旧皇城坝一带了。那里原来是有名的贫民窟，尽是些破街小巷，污泥满地，又臭又脏；旁边有一座所谓“煤山”，实际上是几十年积累下来的一座垃圾山；还有一条“龙须沟”似的污秽恶臭的“御河”。如今，在皇城前面是一条宽阔得惊人的柏油大马路——“人民南路”，左右横贯着二十多公尺宽的“人民东路”和“人民西路”。每逢国际劳动节和国庆节，成都市人民就在这个马路广场上集会庆祝。旁边的那座垃圾山如今也已经变成了可容三万人的“人民体育场”了。“御河”也已拓宽加深，流着从城外引来的清水。当我第一次走到旧皇城门口的时候，许久许久我都不敢相信自己的眼睛。
    当成都人向你炫耀新马路的时候，他一定不会忘记告诉你马路下面的变化。解放后不到两个月，人民政府就着手解决直接关系几十万市民最紧迫的下水道问题。前后将近有十万人参加了疏淘横贯市区南部经常泛滥的金河和暗沟，新修了可供二十万居民排水用的钢筋混凝土下水道。从此，成都就再没有闹过水患了；而过去只要连下两天大雨，全城三分之一的街道都要淹在水里，出门就得过“桥”，而且年年都是如此。
            小吃和名胜
    成都的饮食，特别是小吃，一向驰名全国。自从今年春天全行业公私合营以后，著名的餐馆和小食店都大力保持和发扬了原有特点，生意比前些日子更好了。像有名的“龙抄手”、“赖汤元”、“竟成园”、“师友面”、“荔枝巷水饺”……常常是要等上许久才能吃得上嘴。在饭馆门口，我再也找不到那些要饭的乞丐了。我看到的却是许多馆子大门上都贴有大红纸的喜报，原来是工商联对它们公私合营以后工作改进的表扬。有一天，在“竟成园”吃饭的时候，我听到这么一件事：这家大餐馆有一个第一流的著名厨师汤永清，能做一千多种菜，一只鸡到他手里就能出来八、九十种菜。在旧社会里，生活逼人，他怕“教了徒弟，饿死师傅”，总是保守自己业务的秘密。解放以后，这种旧观念一时也还没有消除。做菜时总不让人去看。但是，在“竟成园”公私合营以后，这位老师傅好像变了一个人，他不仅欢欣鼓舞，而且在大会上公开了自己的技术，保证要在半年内教好三个徒弟。
    在这座古城里，前人留下了许许多多富有历史意义和艺术价值的名胜古迹。解放前的几十年中，这些地方有的被湮没荒废了，有的甚至被国民党军队摧毁了。这几年来，由于人民政府的保护和整顿，所有这些古代人民智慧的结晶都重新放出了光彩。解放前夕已残破不堪的“武侯祠”——三国时诸葛亮的祠堂，如今不仅恢复原状，而且增加了过去为军阀霸占的一大片园林，成为广大人民游览休息的胜地。锦江南岸的“望江楼”也已整修一新，在翠竹林中，耸立着经过民间老艺人重新彩绘过的崇丽阁、吟诗楼和濯锦楼。特别吸引人的是全部整修后重新开放的“杜甫草堂”。现在，这个唐朝伟大诗人流寓成都时的草堂故宅门前，树木葱茏，溪水萦回。入门以后，有成林的楠木和梅花树，掩映着纪念诗人的诗史堂和工部祠。东穿花径，西凭水槛，还点缀着绿水红荷。在这里，不仅可以感到身临当年杜甫诗里的情景，而且还可以在新设的陈列室里看到几千册各种版本的杜诗及其研究论著，欣赏当代名画家齐白石等所作的几十幅杜甫诗意画。站在杜甫纪念像前，我不禁记起他的“茅屋为秋风所破歌”来。听吧！“安得广厦千万间，大庇天下寒士俱欢颜，风雨不动安如山！呜呼，何时眼前突兀见此屋，吾庐独破受冻死亦足！”有着这样怀抱的爱国诗人，要是今天在世的话，不知道他该是怎样的欢欣呵！
    所有这一些当然还只是旧成都的翻新，只有到了郊外工业建设地区以后，我才真正看到了正在茁壮生长的全新的成都和它的灿烂的前程。
          未来的工业城
    一天下午，我乘吉普车往北郊开去，和我同去的还有成都城市建设委员会的王同志。出城以后，我们沿着新修的公路东去。纵横交错的新路，把青翠的田野割成了许多方块。载着建筑器材的大卡车，在这些路上穿梭似地来去。司机同志告诉我，这些路现在连名字都还没有取呢。
    一根根正在冒烟的烟囱和一座座的水塔，由远而近，由小而大。我们故意让车子放慢了脚步，从它们的身边擦过。这些大多是才投入生产不久的新工厂，有火力发电厂，铁路机车修理厂和三个大型机制砖瓦厂，从外面看去，就可以知道它们的规模都不小。我正想问为什么要搞这么多砖瓦厂，就听见王同志说：
     “前面还有一个比前三个厂规模更大的第四个机制砖瓦厂正在施工，还有全国第二座现代化刃具厂也在这里紧张地建设中。我们还要建立一座由八个工厂组成的“房屋联合加工厂”来大量提供“房屋零件”。这些都是为了迎接即将展开的真正大规模的基本建设。现在我们还仅仅是个开始呢。”
    继续前进，我们钻进一片红砖黄瓦大楼构成的建筑群中。
    这里有的是业已建好的工厂办公大楼和职工宿舍；有的是已经开课的学校，学生们正在操场上打球。单是今年要建好的，就有电讯工程、地质勘测等十多个学校。
    和这些已经建成的大楼连接在一起的，是许多高架着脚手架的施工工地。像巨人的手臂似的起重机正在摇摆，到处是建筑器材。
    在这些土地上，已经出现了电影院，俱乐部，百货商店，合作社，银行……。一个市镇的雏形已经有了。在这一带新兴工业地区，人民政府已经新修了十四公里的下水道；一个每天能供应十二万吨水的自来水厂也快要完工了。通往工厂、学校地区的新建马路正在不断地延伸着。
    从这片建筑群中出来，我们的车子又朝着前面另一个建筑群开去。
    这时候，我突然记起在城市建设委员会办公室里看见的那张关于成都建设规划的巨幅蓝图。在那幅壮丽的远景中，现在这些新建筑就太微不足道了。到1962年的时候，工厂和学校差不多会把整个城区一层又一层地包围起来。在东南北三方一、二十公里范围内，烟囱和高楼将密集如森林，只是西边还留着一个缺口作为发展的余地。那时候，二十公里外将有许多个八九万人的“工人镇”，像卫星似的保卫着这座巨大的社会主义工业城市。
