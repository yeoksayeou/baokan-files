The Second Design Institute of the Ministry of Railways has improved the design quality of the southern section of the Neikun Railway. The Neikun Railway, from Yiliang to Rongfeng, is approximately 284 kilometers long and is the section with the most complex terrain and the most arduous engineering work on the entire line. The original design had three double-engine traction sections, separated by intervals, on this section of the line, totaling 153 kilometers in length. Because the double-engine traction was divided into too many sections, and steeply ascended and descended on mountains over 800 meters high, the railway, once completed, would not only affect train operation time and safety, but also increase transportation costs.

After criticizing the design ideology that emphasized "more" and "faster" while neglecting "better" and "more economical," and failing to consider future transportation needs, the Second Design Institute rectified the design quality of this section of the line. In the current design, except for the section from Yiliang to Gela River, which could not change from double-engine traction to single-engine traction due to the passage through a narrow river valley, the remaining two sections have been changed to single-engine traction either along the original line or along other routes. It is estimated that changing to single-engine traction for the Songshuyou to Pogou section alone will save more than one million yuan in freight costs annually. (Xi)

    内昆铁路南段设计质量改善
    铁道部第二设计院改善了内昆铁路南段线路的设计质量。内昆铁路从彝良到榕峰长约二百八十四公里，是全线地形最复杂，工程最艰巨的地段。原来的设计在这段线路上有互相间隔的三段双机牵引地段。全长一百五十三公里。因为双机牵引分段太多，而且在八百多公尺的高山上陡上陡下，铁路建成以后，不仅会影响行车运转时间和安全，也会增加运输费用。
    第二设计院批判了偏重“多、快”忽略“好、省”和不为将来运输着想的设计思想之后，改正了这段线路的设计质量。现在的设计中，除彝良至格拉河一段因为被狭窄的河谷通过，无法把双机牵引改为单机牵引外，其余两段都在原线或走其他线路改成单机牵引了。据估计仅松树油至婆姑一段，改用单机牵引后，每年即可节省运费一百万元以上。　（铣）
