    Another Xinjiang Air Route Successfully Completes Trial Flight

    According to Xinhua News Agency, the Urumqi-Altay air route has successfully completed its trial flight and will soon be officially opened to traffic.

    The trial flight plane took off from Urumqi Airport at 9:07 AM on the 14th, flying over the vast Gurbantunggut Desert, and the lush pastures and farmlands on both sides of the Ulungur River and the Irtysh River. After a total voyage of 438 kilometers and eleven hours and three minutes, it landed safely in Altay City amidst the warm welcome of people of all ethnic groups.

    The Altay region, where Altay is located, is a rich place with a large number of fishery and animal husbandry products, precious medicinal materials, and endless mineral deposits. However, it is almost isolated from the rest of the world by the Gurbantunggut Desert. It takes more than 2,000 li for a car to bypass this desert to Urumqi. After the air transportation line is opened, it will be possible to sell some of the valuable furs, medicinal materials, and fish from here to the farmers and herdsmen all year round, and supply them with medicines, vegetables, and fruits.

    新疆又一条航线试航成功
    据新华社讯　乌鲁木齐—阿勒泰航线试航成功，不久即可正式通航。
    试航飞机在十四日晨九时零七分从乌鲁木齐机场起飞，飞过广漠的古尔班通古特沙漠，和乌伦古河、额尔齐斯河两岸如茵的牧场、农田，共历航程四百三十八公里，用了十一小时零三分钟，在阿勒泰市各族人民热烈欢迎中安全着陆。
    阿勒泰所在的阿尔泰山区是个富饶的地方，有大量的渔牧产品，有名贵的药材，有无尽的矿藏。但是，它却被古尔班通古特沙漠隔绝得几乎成了另一个天地。汽车绕过这片沙漠到乌鲁木齐要行驶两千多华里。空中运输线打开以后，就可以四季无阻地为这里的农牧民销出部分贵重的皮毛、药材和鱼类，供应他们药品、蔬菜和水果。
