    The Yan River Still Flows
    By our reporter Zhu Bo
          Yan'an is Under Construction

    This March, when the Five Provinces (Regions) Youth Afforestation Conference was held in Yan'an, I went to Yan'an with some veteran comrades who had worked in Yan'an in the past. I saw that they were all as excited as if they had returned to their hometown, telling others: That is Du Fu Chuan, that is Phoenix Mountain. They observed every plant and tree in Yan'an with great affection. I saw an old comrade lingering for a long time in the cave dwelling he had lived in; I also saw an old comrade pacing under a poplar tree he had planted with his own hands... Some comrades also patiently searched for the place where they used to perform the Yangko dance for the leading comrades of the Party Central Committee during the Spring Festival... In the evening, listen, the focus of conversations in all the dormitories was only one thing – Yan'an. They were all recalling Yan'an's past, praising Yan'an's present, and imagining Yan'an's future.

    What is Yan'an like now? The Yan River is still flowing as usual! But the face of Mother Yan'an has become even younger. The old city of Yan'an has become unrecognizable. Before many comrades left Yan'an, the city was bombed into rubble by Japanese imperialism, leaving only a few old locust trees swaying in the wind and rain. Especially after the Kuomintang army occupied Yan'an, the destruction was even more severe.

    Now, as the youth representatives attending the Five Provinces (Regions) Youth Afforestation Conference said, Yan'an is to be built into the most beautiful garden. This garden is already taking shape. Look! The neat and wide streets in Yan'an city and the tall buildings standing on both sides; look! The riparian forests planted on both sides of the Yan River – willow trees swaying in the wind and graceful white poplars; and in Zaoyuan, Yangjialing, Wangjiaping, as well as the surrounding Pagoda Mountain, Phoenix Mountain, and Qingliang Mountain, the cave dwellings destroyed by the Kuomintang army have been renewed. Everywhere, trees and flowers from southern China have been planted...

    In the past, in Yangjialing and Zaoyuan, people could not see any precious flowers and trees, but now, planted here are Osmanthus fragrans, snow pine, wintersweet, ginkgo, dawn redwood, and podocarpus nagi from the West Lake... There are no fewer than dozens of kinds of famous flowers and exotic trees. These precious flowers and trees have made Zaoyuan and Yangjialing even more beautiful. However, this is only the beginning, and new flowers and trees are still being cultivated. The Yan'an Forestry Bureau has cultivated more than 680 mu of nurseries, including more than 50 kinds of trees, such as white poplar, mulberry, oil pine, Duli pear, apple, pear, and walnut, planning to launch a larger-scale tree planting and afforestation campaign this autumn. In a few years, Yan'an will become even more beautiful. Whether you stroll along the Yan River or climb Pagoda Mountain or Phoenix Mountain, it will make you feel like you are in a very beautiful garden.

    Every moment we were in Yan'an, we felt that Yan'an was changing! Moving forward! This March, the Yan'an Cinema, which can accommodate more than 1,000 spectators, had not yet started construction, but today, a brand-new cinema has been completed. Yesterday, the drilling machine for the geological exploration of the Yan'an Bridge was still turning on the beach on the bank of the Yan River, but today, the machine has been moved to the center of the Yan River... In particular, industry and transportation are developing faster. Standing on the hillside or on the bank of the Yan River, you can hear the sound of factory machines turning, and you can also see strings of cars speeding by...

    Some old factories of the past have been closed down, while new factories have been established. Some old factories that have not been closed down have now added new equipment. When we came in March of this year, the Yan'an Power Plant was still under construction, but now, it has begun to generate electricity. And new factories, such as tractor repair shops, automobile repair shops, waterworks, chemical fertilizer plants, and food processing plants... some have already begun construction, and some are being planned. Under Qingliang Mountain, in the original Central Printing Plant, the old machine – the one that printed many important works by Chairman Mao and the leading comrades of the Central Committee – has been sent to the Beijing Museum. Now, in addition to some of the original machines, new machines have been added.

        Advanced Cooperative Achieved in One Step

    In early autumn, the sky in Yan'an is so blue, dotted with a few white clouds. The rolling Loess Plateau has become a green ocean, and flocks of white sheep are moving and grazing on the hillsides, like waves in the green ocean. The shepherds still stand on the hills, with white sheepskin towels tied around their heads and red belts around their waists, playing clear and melodious shepherd's flutes. The difference is that these lands are now under the unified management of agricultural cooperatives, and the boundaries between lands have been broken; the flocks of sheep have become larger, and they are the property of the agricultural cooperatives.

    In the rural areas of Yan'an, unlike other regions, it is not necessary to go through primary cooperatives before transitioning to advanced cooperatives. The vast majority of advanced cooperatives here are achieved in "one step." According to statistics, there are 603 agricultural cooperatives in Yan'an, with cooperative households accounting for more than 93% of the total number of households, including 585 advanced cooperatives, with cooperative households accounting for 90.6% of the total number of households. Among the advanced cooperatives, 492 were established directly from mutual aid teams without going through primary cooperatives. The Minister of Mutual Aid and Cooperation of the Yan'an County Party Committee told us that when the high tide of agricultural cooperation came, many farmers proposed when building cooperatives: "Do not pay land remuneration." They said, "Rather walk on the bowstring than on the back of the bow." At that time, the district committee, the county committee, and the Yan'an prefectural committee believed that this situation might not be true, so they successively sent work teams to go deep into the rural areas to conduct investigations. The results of the investigation showed that, except for the five-guarantee households without labor, all firmly stated that they did not want land remuneration. They said, "The land was distributed to us by the Party, why should we pay remuneration?" "We rely on labor to eat, how can we rely on land to exploit?" Some farmers even proposed, "If the land has remuneration, I will not join the cooperative." Only then did the Yan'an prefectural committee ask the Shaanxi provincial committee for approval to begin establishing advanced cooperatives achieved in "one step."

    Why did Yan'an establish advanced cooperatives directly without going through primary cooperatives? Gao Xingde, a member of the Zaoyuan Village Advanced Cooperative in Zaoyuan Township and director of the Zaoyuan Township Credit Cooperative, explained this question to us: That was during the Spring Festival of 1943, when Chairman Mao invited many farmers from Zaoyuan Township to a gathering in Zaoyuan. He was one of the ordinary farmers who was invited. He clearly remembered that Chairman Mao was wearing a gray coarse cloth uniform, smiling and standing at the door of the meeting room, inviting them in one by one and shaking hands with them. Then, he listened very kindly to their reports on problems in agricultural production and exchanged opinions on agricultural production with them. At that gathering, Chairman Mao proposed that they organize themselves, pointing out that only in this way could they improve production and get rid of poverty. Gao Xingde and many farmers understood the principle of "organizing" at that time, so after they returned, they went to connect with other farmers and organized a temporary labor exchange team. That year, they cultivated more than 200 mu of wasteland and harvested more than 300 dan of grain, with each laborer receiving 18 dan of grain. In the winter of that year, many farmers had surplus grain and wore new cotton clothes. During the Spring Festival of 1944, a total of 22 households in the village slaughtered 18 pigs. During this Spring Festival, Gao Xingde and many other farmers reported the achievements of that year's production to Chairman Mao with joy.

    In the spring of 1944, they studied Chairman Mao's speech on "getting organized," and the labor exchange team expanded further, becoming more experienced in collective labor. Even the women of Zaoyuan Village organized weaving groups. That year, there was another bumper harvest. In the spring of 1948, when many farmers from Zaoyuan Village returned from the guerrilla隊 to rebuild their homes, it was the most difficult time. However, they used the method of organizing, forming three mutual aid teams to overcome difficulties and planting crops on all the barren land. Last year, after Chairman Mao's report on the issue of agricultural cooperation was transmitted to Zaoyuan Village, the farmers of Zaoyuan Village scrambled to study this document. They knew that this was the collective farm they had been looking forward to! They unanimously passed a resolution in their studies to establish advanced cooperatives and not primary cooperatives.

    Another reason is that when the issue of land remuneration was mentioned, the farmers of Yan'an thought of the old comrades who had lived in Yan'an in the past. As an old farmer said, "Which piece of land does not have the marks of comrades' hoes and the sweat that flowed!" Gao Xingde took us to see the crops of the Zaoyuan Advanced Cooperative. Pointing to the sturdy rice, he said, "We didn't have even one mu of such paddy land in the past, but today, we have more than 400 mu. Where did the paddy land come from? You will know if you follow the canal. This canal is connected from Zaoyuan. It is a canal that the staff of the Party Central Committee personally built during our great production campaign." His meaning was that such land could not be rewarded.

            Growth of New People

    The biggest change in Yan'an is the change in people. In the new cause, new people who have grown up can be seen everywhere. The cowherds of the past have now grown up and become the directors of agricultural cooperatives; the people who defended Yan'an in the past are now driving tractors back to Yan'an; youths from all over the country, some from the West Lake in Hangzhou, some from prosperous Shanghai, they came to Yan'an with lofty ideals, just like in the early days of the War of Resistance Against Japan, and they have become the builders of Yan'an.

    In the office of the Qiao'ergou Yifeng Advanced Cooperative, the deputy director of the cooperative received us. Who is this young director of the cooperative?

    The students of Lu Xun Academy of Arts probably remember that once, when Chairman Mao was giving you a report (at that time, he was still a very young child), he climbed barefoot on the recording table next to Chairman Mao, staring with his eyes, and always looked at Chairman Mao. Think about it, many of you have given him makeup in the Qiao'ergou Yangko Team, and many comrades have fought water battles with him and were defeated by him while swimming in the Yan River. Because he didn't use water, he used mud. He couldn't beat you with water, so he drove you away with mud. Who is he? This is a cowherd from Qiao'ergou. His academic name is Zhao Lianyue, but at that time, the people of Lu Xun Academy of Arts called him "Little Devil," "Naughty Little Devil." Now, he has grown up and is already married. When he was eighteen years old, he joined the Communist Youth League and joined the Communist Party of China. He served as the secretary of the Youth League branch in the township and has been elected as the deputy director of the agricultural cooperative since 1954. Now, if you see him, you probably won't recognize him.

    In Qiao'ergou, at the school building of Lu Xun Academy of Arts, now is the Yan'an Tractor Station. The tractor drivers are all young men, some from the Northeast, some from Henan, some from Guanzhong, and some of them used to defend Yan'an in the past. Before they came to Yan'an, they had all learned the skills of production and came to Yan'an proudly driving tractors themselves. One of the young tractor drivers, named Liu Huaiwang, joined the army in 1941 and has been defending Yan'an since 1942. When Yan'an was recovered in 1948, fifteen tanks of the Kuomintang army were captured, and he was transferred to learn how to drive tanks. He fought against the enemy in southern Shanxi and also suppressed bandits in the dangerous Qinling Mountains. He began learning to drive a tractor in the spring of this year. In early August of this year, when he heard that the People's Liberation Army was helping the people of Yan'an establish a tractor station, he automatically signed up to work at the Yan'an Tractor Station. He said, in the past I defended the people of Yan'an, today I will help the people of Yan'an build a new life.

    Yan'an is still waving to the youth from all over the country. Many youths have come. Among them are medical personnel, teachers, and technicians... They are all here to build Yan'an. Recently, new schools have begun to be built, including a forestry school and an agricultural school – this is the future Yan'an Agricultural University, located in Yangjialing, and other schools such as the Yan'an Agricultural Cooperative Cadre School and the Yan'an Commercial Cadre School. These schools, like the various schools in Yan'an in the past, are attracting young people from all over the country.

    The Yan River in autumn is particularly energetic. The river water changes constantly, sometimes clear and sometimes turbid, sometimes rapid and sometimes slow. The water flow hits the huge river pebbles, splashing waves, "哗哗..." flowing to the Yellow River, to the sea. The Yan River seems to be laughing and singing, singing about Mother Yan'an, singing about the great motherland.

    延河水在照样流

          延安在建设中
    今年3月，在延安召开五省（区）青年造林大会的时候，我曾和一些过去在延安工作过的老同志到了延安。我看到他们都像回到自己的家乡那样，兴奋地告诉别人：那是杜甫川，那是凤凰山，他们非常亲切地观察着延安的一草一木。我看见一个老同志长时间停留在他住过的窑洞里；也看见一位老同志在他亲手栽种的一棵杨树下徘徊着，……还有的同志非常耐心地寻找着他们过去在春节时给党中央负责同志扭秧歌的地方……到了夜晚，听吧，所有的宿舍里谈话的中心只有一个——延安。他们都在回忆延安的过去，赞美着延安的现在，想像着延安的未来。
    现在的延安怎样呢？延河水在照常流！但是母亲延安的面貌却变得更加年青了。旧的延安城变得使人认不出来了，当很多同志离开延安之前，延安城被日本帝国主义炸成一片瓦砾，只剩几棵老槐树在风雨中摇摆着，特别是国民党军侵占延安之后，被破坏的更加惨重。
    如今，正像出席五省（区）青年造林大会的青年代表们所说的，要把延安建设成最美丽的花园。这个花园已经初具规模了，看！延安城里那整齐而宽广的两条大街和矗立在两旁的高大的楼房；看！延河两岸种起来的护岸林——随风飘动的柳树和亭亭玉立的白杨；而在枣园、杨家岭、王家坪，以及周围的宝塔山、凤凰山和清凉山上，遭到国民党军破坏的窑洞又焕然一新了。到处都种上了从祖国南方运来的树木和花草……
    过去，在杨家岭，在枣园，人们看不到什么名贵的花木，而现在，栽种在这里的，有来自西湖畔的四季桂花、雪松、腊梅、银杏、水杉、竹柏，………名花异木，不下数十种。这些名贵的花木，把枣园和杨家岭打扮的更加秀丽了。然而，这只是开始，新的花木还在培育中。延安林业局培育了六百八十多亩苗圃，包括五十多种树木，有白杨、桑树、油松、杜梨、苹果、梨树、胡桃等，计划在今年秋季就开展更大规模的植树造林运动。再过几年，延安将会变得更加美丽，无
  论你沿着延河散步，无论你爬上宝塔山或凤凰山，都使你好像到了一座非常秀丽的花园一样。
    我们在延安每时每刻都感到延安在变化着！前进着！今年3月，可以容纳一千多观众的延安影剧院还没有动工，而今天，一座崭新的影剧院已经竣工了。昨天，进行延安大桥地质勘探工作的钻探机，还在延河岸上的沙滩上转动着，而今天，机器已经移到延河中心去了……特别是工业、交通运输业，发展的更快，你站在山坡上或者是延河边上，可以听到工厂机器的转动声，也可以看到成串的汽车在奔驶……
    过去的旧工厂，有的撤销了，而新的工厂又建立起来了，有些没有撤销的旧工厂，现在也增添了新的设备。今年3月我们来的时候，延安发电厂还正在修建，现在，已经开始发电了。而新的工厂，像拖拉机修配厂、汽车修配厂、自来水厂、化学肥料厂、食品加工厂……有的已开始修建，有的正在作计划。在清凉山下，原来的中央印刷厂里，旧的机器——就是那部曾印过毛主席以及中央负责同志很多重要著作的机器，已经送到北京博物馆里去了，而现在除了一些原来的机器外，又添了新的机器。
        一步登天的高级社
    初秋，延安的天空是那样蔚蓝蔚蓝的，点缀着几朵白云。那起伏的黄土高原，变成了绿色的海洋，白色的羊群蠕动着在山坡上吃草，好像绿色海洋的浪花一样。牧羊人仍然站在山头上，头扎着白羊肚毛巾，腰下系着红色的腰带，吹着清脆而悦耳的牧笛。不同的是，这些土地已经归农业社统一经营了，地与地之间的界线已经打破了；羊群变大了，它是属于农业社的财产。
    在延安的农村中，不像其他地区那样，要经过初级社，然后才转高级社。这里绝大多数的高级社，都是“一步登天”。据统计：延安共有农业社六百零三个，入社农户占总农户的93％以上，其中有高级社五百八十五个，入社农户占总农户90.6％，在高级社当中有四百九十二个没有经过初级社，而是直接由互助组建立成高级社的。中共延安县委互助合作部长告诉我们说：当农业合作化高潮到来的时候，很多村建社时，农民都提出：“不要土地报酬”。他们说：“宁走弓弦，不走弓背”。当时区委、县委、延安地委认为这个情况未必真实，就先后派出工作组深入农村进行调查。调查的结果，除了没有劳力的五保户外，都坚决表示不要土地报酬，他们说：“土地都是党分给我们的，为啥要报酬呢？”“靠劳动吃饭，还能靠土地剥削”，有的农民甚至提出“如果土地有报酬，我就不入社了”。延安地委这才请示陕西省委批准，开始建立“一步登天”的高级社。
    为什么延安会不经过初级社，直接建立高级社呢？枣园乡枣园村高级社的社务委员、枣园乡信用社主任高兴德，向我们解释了这个问题：那是在1943年的春节里，毛主席邀请了很多枣园乡的农民到延园里开联欢会，他就是被邀的普通农民中的一个。他非常清楚地记得毛主席穿着灰粗布制服，微笑着站在会议室的门口，一个一个请他们进去和他们握手，然后，非常亲切地听取他们汇报农业生产中的问题，并和他们交换农业生产上的意见。在那次联欢会上，毛主席就提出要他们组织起来，指出只有这样，才能搞好生产，摆脱贫困。高兴德和很多农民在那个时候就明白了“组织起来”的道理，所以，他们回去之后，就分头串连其他农民，组织了一个临时的变工队。这一年，他们共开了二百多亩荒地，收了三百多石谷，每个劳动力分到十八石谷。这一年冬天，很多农民都存下余粮了，都穿上了新的棉衣。1944年春节里，全村共有二十二户人家，杀了十八口猪，就在这一年的春节里，高兴德又和很多农民一起，带着喜悦的心情向毛主席汇报这一年生产的成绩。
    1944年春天，他们学习了毛主席“组织起来”的讲话，变工队更扩大了，对集体劳动更有经验了，就连枣园村的妇女们也组织起了织布组。这一年，又丰收了。1948年春天，枣园村很多农民从游击队回来重建家园的时候。那是最困难的时候。但是，他们就用组织起来的方法，组成了三个互助组来战胜困难，把荒芜了的土地都种上了庄稼。去年，当毛主席关于农业合作化问题的报告传到枣园村之后，枣园村的农民，都争着学习这个文件，他们知道这就是他们所盼望的集体农庄啊！他们并在学习中一致通过，要成立高级社，不要初级社的决议。
    还有一个原因，当提到土地报酬的时候，延安农民就想到过去在延安住过的老同志。正像一个老农民所说的：“那一块土地没有同志们的镢头印和流下来的汗哪！”高兴德带着我们看了枣园高级社的庄稼，他指着那茁壮的水稻说：“像这样的水地，过去我们一亩都没有，而今天，我们却有了四百多亩，水地那里来的，你顺着水渠走一趟就知道了。这条水渠是从延园里串过来的，是我们闹大生产时，党中央机关的工作人员亲自动手修成的一条水渠”。他的意思是说像这样的土地是不能要报酬的。
            新人的成长
    延安最大的变化就是人的变化，在新的事业里，到处都看到新成长起来的人们。过去的放牛娃现在成长起来，成了农业社的社主任；过去保卫过延安的人现在又驾驶着拖拉机回到了延安；全国各地青年，有来自杭州西子湖畔、有来自繁华的上海，他（她）们就像抗战初期那样，抱着崇高的理想来到延安，他们成了延安的建设者。
    在桥儿沟艺丰高级社办公室里，社的副主任接见了我们，这个青年的社主任是谁呢？
    鲁艺的同学大概记得，有一次，毛主席给你们作报告的时候（那时他还是个很小的娃娃），他曾光着脚爬在毛主席旁边的记录桌上，瞪着一双眼睛，一直注视着毛主席。想一想看，你们有不少的人在桥儿沟秧歌队里给他化过装，也有不少的同志在延河里游泳时，和他打水仗而被他打败了。因为他用的不是水，他用的是稀泥，用水打不过你们，用稀泥把你们赶跑了。他是谁？这就是桥儿沟的一个放牛娃，他的学名叫赵连玉，不过，那时候鲁艺的人都管他叫“小鬼”，“调皮的小鬼”。现在，他已长大成人了，早就结了婚。在他十八岁的时候，他参加了青年团，加入了中国共产党，他曾担任青年团乡支部书记，从1954年就被选为农业社的副主任。现在，你如果看见他，保险认不出来了。
    在桥儿沟，就在鲁艺的校舍，现在是延安拖拉机站，拖拉机手都是一些年青小伙子，他们有的来自东北，有的来自河南，有的来自关中，其中还有的在过去曾保卫过延安。他们来延安之前，都已学会了生产的本领，自己驾驶着拖拉机，耀武扬威的来到延安的。其中有一个年青的拖拉机手，名叫刘怀旺，1941年参军，从1942年起就一直保卫着延安。在1948年收复延安的时候，缴获了国民党军十五辆坦克，他被调去学习驾驶坦克。他曾在晋南打击敌人，也在险要的秦岭上剿过土匪。从今年春天他开始学习驾驶拖拉机，在今年8月初，听说人民解放军帮助延安人民建立拖拉机站，他就自动报名来延安拖拉机站工作。他说，过去我保卫延安人民，今天就要帮助延安人民建立新的生活。
    延安仍然在向全国各地的青年招手，很多青年来了，他们当中，有医务人员，有教师、有技术人员……他们都是来建设延安的。最近，新的学校又开始修建了，有林业学校、农业学校——这是未来的延安农业大学，校址就在杨家岭，其他还有延安农业合作干部学校，延安商业干部学校。这些学校，也像过去的延安各个学校一样，吸引着各地的青年。
    延河在秋天特别显得有生气，河水变化多端，时清时浊，时喘急时缓慢，水流冲击着巨大的河卵石，飞溅着浪花，“哗哗……”地向黄河、向大海流去。延河好像是在欢笑和歌唱，歌唱着母亲延安，歌唱着伟大的祖国。
