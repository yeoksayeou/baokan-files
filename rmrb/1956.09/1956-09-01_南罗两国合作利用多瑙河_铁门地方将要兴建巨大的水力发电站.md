South and Romania Cooperate to Utilize the Danube River
    A Huge Hydroelectric Power Station Will Be Built in the Iron Gate Area
    (Report from this newspaper) Yugoslavia and Romania will jointly construct a huge hydroelectric power station at the Iron Gate section of the Danube River. The annual power generation of this power station will reach 12 billion kilowatt-hours, more than doubling the generating capacity of all existing hydroelectric power stations on the Danube. The plan to build this hydroelectric power station was decided upon during Yugoslav President Tito's visit to Romania in consultation with the leaders of the Romanian government.
    It is estimated that the construction of this hydroelectric power station will take more than ten years and cost approximately 300 billion dinars (Yugoslav currency), equivalent to about 400 million US dollars. The dam of the Iron Gate Hydroelectric Power Station will form an artificial lake, whose water can be used to irrigate the fields on both sides of the Danube River and will raise the water level of the Danube River, allowing navigation vessels to reach Belgrade, the capital of Yugoslavia.
    After the completion of this hydroelectric power station, it will have very important economic significance for Yugoslavia and Romania, as well as the countries throughout the Danube River basin.

    南罗两国合作利用多瑙河
    铁门地方将要兴建巨大的水力发电站
    本报讯　南斯拉夫和罗马尼亚两国将在多瑙河的铁门地方共同合作建设一个巨大的水力发电站。这个水电站的每年发电量将达到一百二十亿瓩时，比多瑙河上现有的全部水电站的发电能力还要超过一倍。建设这个水电站的计划，是在南斯拉夫总统铁托访问罗马尼亚时和罗马尼亚政府的领导人商议决定的。
    据估计，这个水电站的工程将需要进行十年多的时间，耗资大约三千亿第纳尔（南币），合四亿美元左右。铁门水电站的拦河坝将形成一个人造湖，它的水可以用来灌溉多瑙河两岸的田地，并将提高多瑙河的水位，使航海轮船可以直达南斯拉夫首都贝尔格莱德。
    这个水电站建成以后，对于南斯拉夫和罗马尼亚以及整个多瑙河流域的国家都将有很重要的经济意义。
