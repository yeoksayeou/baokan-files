    Yangtze River Shipping Unified Operation and Management
    Minsheng and Three Other Joint State-Private Shipping Companies Merged into the Yangtze River Shipping Administration
    (Our Hubei dispatch, September 1st) The business operations of the Minsheng, Shanghai, and Chuanjiang joint state-private shipping companies officially merged with the Yangtze River Shipping Administration on September 1st. The Yangtze River Shipping Administration will now uniformly manage all business operations. This marks a new stage in the socialist transformation of these three shipping companies, and the Yangtze River's shipping industry has transitioned from decentralized operation to unified management.
    The businesses of these three shipping companies have all developed to varying degrees after the establishment of joint state-private ownership. Minsheng Company transformed from a loss-making entity in the private sector to generating significant annual surpluses. Its transportation capacity increased by over 37,000 tons and 8,000 horsepower, its freight volume quadrupled, and its labor productivity increased by 150%. The Shanghai Shipping Company, which had a slower rate of development, also saw its freight volume increase by 73% compared to before the joint venture. However, due to decentralized operations along the Yangtze River, there were drawbacks such as overlapping organizations, wasted personnel, dispersed technical resources, and inconsistent systems. These issues led to increased management costs and particularly prevented the full utilization of ship efficiency. For example, the landing crafts of the Yangtze River Shipping Administration and Minsheng Company had a shallow draft and a large towing capacity, each capable of carrying four barges from Hankou to Yichang and then two barges from Yichang to Chongqing, and vice versa. However, due to the abundance of cargo in the upper reaches of the Yangtze and the scarcity in the lower reaches, to ensure that each company could meet its transportation plan, these landing crafts only towed two barges in the Hankou-Yichang section. This allowed the Shanghai Company, which had poorer business performance, to dispatch two additional tugboats to handle the transportation task in the Hankou-Yichang section, resulting in one-third of the landing crafts' efficiency not being utilized. This situation not only failed to adapt to the increasing transportation demands but also posed a risk that the Yangtze River shipping work would not be able to complete the First Five-Year Plan in four and a half years. At the same time, even with these accommodating measures, the profits and losses of the companies still varied greatly. Minsheng Company had a surplus of over 17 million yuan last year, while the Shanghai Company still suffered a loss of more than 400,000 yuan.
    After the arrival of the high tide of socialist transformation, the capitalist representatives and workers of the three shipping companies conducted multiple discussions on this issue. Zhou Xiaohuai, Wu Jinhang, Deng Dongqin, and the directors scattered throughout various locations of Minsheng Company repeatedly studied this issue through letters, phone calls, and telegrams. The Shanghai Company even held a board meeting specifically to discuss it. All agreed that unified operation and management of Yangtze River shipping was necessary to fully unleash transportation potential and meet the needs of socialist construction. Tong Shaosheng, Deputy General Manager of Minsheng Company, Kuan Yanfang, Chairman of Shanghai Company, and Zhou Weixun, Vice Chairman of Chuanjiang Company, all submitted applications to the government separately or jointly at the end of last year, requesting that all business operations of the three companies be merged into the Yangtze River Shipping Administration for unified management. After careful consideration, the State Council and the Ministry of Communications approved the applications of these three companies in late June, deciding to merge their business operations with the Yangtze River Shipping Administration while retaining the companies and board structures and implementing fixed interest rates on shares. The private shares of the three companies will receive fixed interest payments in the future, and the original full-time personnel of the three companies will be appropriately arranged according to their original positions. Tong Shaosheng and Li Zhaoji, capitalist representatives of Minsheng Company, were appointed as Deputy Directors of the Yangtze River Shipping Administration. Xu Yihe, capitalist representative of Shanghai Company, and Deng Xiekang and Huang Ming'an, capitalist representatives of Chuanjiang Company, were also appointed as Deputy Directors of the Shanghai and Chongqing branches of the Yangtze River Shipping Administration, respectively. On September 1st, more than 3,000 workers from the Yangtze River Shipping Administration and Minsheng Company in Hankou held a grand gathering to celebrate the unified operation of Yangtze River shipping work.

    长江航运统一经营管理
    民生等三个公私合营轮船公司并入长江航运管理局
    本报汉口1日电　民生、上海、川江三家公私合营轮船公司的业务机构，于9月1日和长江航运局正式合并，由长江航运局统一经营管理全部业务。这样，这三家轮船公司的社会主义改造已进入了新的阶段，长江的航运事业也由过去分散经营转为统一管理了。
    这三家轮船公司的业务，在公私合营后都有不同程度的发展。民生公司由私营时期亏累不堪转为年年都有很多盈余，运输力量增加了三万七千多吨和八千多马力，货运量也增加了四倍，劳动生产率增长了一倍半。发展较慢的上海轮船公司的货运量也较合营前增加了73％。但是，因为在长江一条航线上分散经营，也就存在着机构重叠，人员浪费，技术力量分散，制度不统一等缺点，以致管理费用增大，特别是船只效能不能充分发挥。举例来说，长江航运局和民生公司的登陆艇吃水浅，拖载量大，每只都能从汉口带四个驳船到宜昌，再由宜昌带两只驳船到重庆，下水也是如此。但因为长江上游货源充足，下游货源少，为了照顾各公司都能完成运输计划，这些登陆艇在汉宜段也只拖两个驳船，让营业情况不好的上海公司另调两只拖轮担负汉宜段的运输任务，以致登陆艇有三分之一的效能没有发挥。这种情况不仅不能适应目前运输任务不断增加的形势，还使长江航运工作有不能在四年半完成第一个五年计划的危险。同时，就是采取这种照顾的办法，各公司的盈亏还是相差很大，民生公司去年盈余一千七百多万元，上海公司仍亏损了四十多万元。
    在社会主义改造的高潮到来以后，三家轮船公司的资方人员和职工群众都对这个问题进行了多次讨论，民生公司董事长周孝怀、吴晋航、邓东琴和分散各地的董事们纷纷通过书信、电话和电报，反复研究这个问题，上海公司还召开董事会进行了专门讨论，都认为长江航运必须统一经营管理，才能充分发挥运输潜力，适应社会主义建设的需要。民生公司副总经理童少生、上海公司董事长蒉延芳和川江公司副董事长周维勋都于去年年底分别或联名向政府提出申请，要求将三家公司的全部业务并入长江航运局统一经营管理。经过慎重研究后，国务院和交通部于6月下旬批准了这三家公司的申请，决定在保留各公司和董事会机构、并实行定股定息的基础上，把业务机构同长江航运局合并。三家公司的私股以后都按定息办法领取固定的利息，三家公司原有的实职人员也按原来职务妥当安排。民生公司资方代表童少生、李肇基被任命为长江航运局副局长，上海公司资方代表徐挹和与川江公司资方代表邓燮康、黄明安也都分别任命为长江航运局上海和重庆分局的副局长。在9月1日这天，长江航运局和民生公司在汉口的三千多名职工举行盛大集会，庆祝长江航运工作的统一经营。
