Xinhua News Agency, September 13th: The Indonesian Parliament Delegation, led by Chairman Kusnan, arrived in Beijing at 4:00 PM today. The delegation is visiting China at the invitation of Liu Shaoqi, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China.

The Indonesian and Chinese national flags fluttered at the airport, and colorful archways displayed slogans welcoming the Indonesian Parliamentary Delegation.

As the Chairman of the Indonesian Parliament Delegation, Kusnan, and the members disembarked, a group of young women rushed forward to present them with flowers. Li Jishen, Li Weihan, and Chen Shutong, Vice-Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Zhang Bojun, Vice-Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Huang Zhen, Chinese Ambassador to Indonesia, and others were present at the aircraft to greet them.

Kusnan delivered a speech at the airport, stating that the Indonesian Parliament Delegation was visiting China with the unanimous approval of the first democratically elected Parliament of Indonesia, in response to Chairman Liu Shaoqi's invitation. He said that the delegation members included parliamentarians from various parties in the parliament, and could therefore be regarded as a miniature parliament. Kusnan said that the delegation hoped their visit would contribute to promoting world peace and friendship between the peoples of China and Indonesia.

At the beginning of his speech, Kusnan expressed his respect by shouting "Independence" in both Indonesian and Chinese. Finally, he ended his speech by shouting "Independence" again. The welcomers responded with prolonged and warm applause, expressing the common feeling of the Chinese and Indonesian people in safeguarding national independence.

Among those present at the airport to welcome the delegation today were members of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Zhang Hanfu, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Hu Yuzhi, Vice President of the China-Indonesia Friendship Association, Xue Zizheng, Vice Mayor of Beijing, and people from all walks of life.

Wiyopranoto, the Indonesian Ambassador to China, was also present at the airport to welcome the delegation.

Xinhua News Agency, September 13th: Liu Shaoqi, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, met with the entire Indonesian Parliament Delegation headed by Chairman Kusnan this evening. Present at the meeting were Li Jishen, Huang Yanpei, Peng Zhen, and Chen Shutong, Vice-Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Zhang Bojun, Vice-Chairman of the National Committee of the CPPCC, and others.

Xinhua News Agency, September 13th: Liu Shaoqi, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China, hosted a banquet this evening in honor of the entire Indonesian Parliament Delegation.

In his welcoming speech at the banquet, Chairman Liu Shaoqi said that our two countries have a shared experience of being subjected to colonial oppression for a long time, and we both have the common desire to safeguard national independence, oppose colonialism, maintain world peace, and oppose the threat of war. Now, both of our countries are engaged in national construction and are striving to protect the integrity of our national territorial sovereignty and the cause of world peace. Therefore, we feel particularly close to our friends from friendly countries.

He said that the Chinese people are very pleased to note that, under the guidance of the Bandung spirit, your great country has not only made encouraging progress in national construction, but also played an increasingly important role in international affairs, especially in promoting friendly cooperation between the peoples of Asia and Africa. Our people sincerely welcome all the achievements of your government and people, and believe that with the united efforts of your entire nation, you will achieve even greater successes.

Chairman Liu Shaoqi raised his glass to wish the friendly relations between the Republic of Indonesia and the People's Republic of China continuous development, to wish the close cooperation between the parliaments of the two countries, and to wish President Sukarno good health.

Kusnan, head of the Indonesian Parliamentary Delegation, expressed his gratitude for Chairman Liu Shaoqi's invitation. He said that the hearts of the Chinese people have been hurt by foreigners, and the Indonesian people have also been ruled by foreigners for three hundred and fifty years. As Chairman Liu Shaoqi said, we have many common problems. For example, improving the people's economy, rebuilding buildings and houses damaged by the war, the Chinese people's recovery of Taiwan, and the Indonesian people's recovery of West Irian, these issues have received great attention from the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China and the Parliament of the Republic of Indonesia.

Kusnan proposed a toast to the continuous development of the friendship between China and the Republic of Indonesia, to the health of Chairman Mao Zedong, and to the close cooperation between the parliaments of the two countries.

Among those present at the banquet tonight were Li Jishen, Huang Yanpei, Peng Zhen, and Chen Shutong, Vice-Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Zhang Bojun, Vice-Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and Zhang Hanfu, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs.

    印度尼西亚国会代表团到达北京
    刘少奇委员长接见并欢宴代表团
    据新华社13日讯　印度尼西亚共和国国会代表团在团长库斯南率领下，今天下午四时到达北京。代表团是应中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会常务委员会委员长刘少奇邀请来中国访问的。
    机场上飘扬着印度尼西亚和中国两国的国旗，彩色牌坊上写着欢迎印度尼西亚国会代表团的标语。
    在印度尼西亚共和国国会代表团团长库斯南和团员们下机时，一群女青年拥上去向他们献花。全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长李济深、李维汉、陈叔通，中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会副主席章伯钧，中国驻印度尼西亚大使黄镇等都到飞机旁边迎接。
    库斯南在机场发表讲话说，印度尼西亚共和国国会代表团是印度尼西亚第一届民选的国会全体一致通过接受刘少奇委员长的邀请而到中国访问的。他说，代表团团员中包括国会各党派的议员，因此也可以说是小型的国会。库斯南说，代表团希望他们的访问有助于促进世界和平，促进中国、印度尼西亚两国人民之间的友谊。
    库斯南在讲话开始时，用印度尼西亚语和中国语高呼“独立”表示敬意。最后，又高呼“独立”结束他的讲话。欢迎者以经久不息的热烈掌声表示中国人民和印度尼西亚人民对于维护民族独立的共同感情。
    今天到机场欢迎的还有：全国人民代表大会常务委员会委员们，外交部副部长章汉夫，中国印度尼西亚友好协会副会长胡愈之，北京市副市长薛子正，以及各界人士。
    印度尼西亚驻中国大使维约普拉诺托也到机场欢迎。
    新华社13日讯　全国人民代表大会常务委员会委员长刘少奇，今晚接见以库斯南团长为首的印度尼西亚共和国国会代表团全体人员。接见时在座的有全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长李济深、黄炎培、彭真、陈叔通，政协全国委员会副主席章伯钧等。
    据新华社13日讯　中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会常务委员会委员长刘少奇，今晚欢宴印度尼西亚共和国国会代表团全体人员。
    刘少奇委员长在宴会上致欢迎词说，我们两国具有长期遭受殖民主义压迫的共同经历，并且都有保卫民族独立、反对殖民主义、维护世界和平、反对战争威胁的共同的愿望。现在我们两国都正在进行国家的建设工作，并且为保卫我们国家领土主权的完整和世界和平事业而奋斗。因此，我们对于来自友邦的各位朋友感到特别的亲切。
    他说，中国人民十分高兴地注意到，在万隆精神的指导下，你们伟大的国家不仅在国家的建设事业中取得了令人鼓舞的进展，而且在国际事务中发挥着越来越重要的作用，特别是在增进亚非各国人民之间的友好合作方面表现了很大的努力。我国人民衷心地欢迎贵国政府和人民的一切成就，并且相信在你们全国人民团结一致的努力之下，将获得更大的成就。
    刘少奇委员长举杯祝印度尼西亚共和国和中华人民共和国两国的友好关系不断发展，祝两国议会的亲密合作，祝苏加诺总统的健康。
    印度尼西亚共和国国会代表团团长库斯南对刘少奇委员长的邀请表示感谢。他说，中国人民的心曾经受到外国人的伤害，印度尼西亚人民也曾经被外国人统治了三百五十年。正如刘少奇委员长说的，我们有着许多共同的问题。例如，改善人民经济，重建因遭受战争破坏的建筑和房屋，中国人民收回台湾和印度尼西亚共和国人民收回西伊里安，这些问题受到中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会常务委员会和印度尼西亚共和国国会很大的注意。
    库斯南提议为中国和印度尼西亚共和国两国的友谊不断发展，为毛泽东主席的健康、为中国和印度尼西亚共和国两国议会的密切合作干杯。
    出席今晚宴会的，有全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长李济深、黄炎培、彭真、陈叔通，中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会副主席章伯钧，外交部副部长章汉夫等。（附图片）
