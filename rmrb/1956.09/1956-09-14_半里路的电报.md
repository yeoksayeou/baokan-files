    A Telegram for Half a Li
    Recently, a person named Huang Qihuang, due to some business, took leave from Shaanxi to return home. When passing through Hankou, he took the opportunity to visit a fellow townsman, Huang Jingming, who works at the Wuhan Metallurgical and Chemical Construction General Company. According to the correspondence address, he knew that Huang Jingming's residence was in the Qingshan Workers' Village, but he could not find his specific residence. So, he ran to the Qingshan Workers' Village Post Office to send a telegram. In fact, Huang's address was less than half a li from the post office.
    Of course, Huang Qihuang's request to send a telegram for half a li is ridiculous, but the Qingshan Workers' Village Post Office did not dissuade him from this action, nor did they direct him, and actually handled the telegram sending procedures.

    半里路的电报
    最近，一个名字叫黄其煌的人，因事从陕西请假回家，路过汉口的时候，顺便去看望一个在武汉冶金化学建设总公司工作的同乡黄镜明。根据通信地址，他知道黄镜明的住区在青山工人村，但找不到他的具体住处。他于是跑到青山工人村邮局发个电报。事实上，黄的住址离邮局不到半华里路程。
    当然，黄其煌要求拍个半里路的电报是可笑的，但是，青山工人村邮局对他的行动却不加劝止，也不为他指引路程，竟承办了发报手续。
