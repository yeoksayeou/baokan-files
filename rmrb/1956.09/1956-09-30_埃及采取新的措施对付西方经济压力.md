Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, September 29th: The Egyptian Ministry of Supply announced on the 28th that Egypt is cracking down on black markets and hoarders of grain as part of a nationwide movement to counter Western economic pressure.

    The Ministry of Supply accused some merchants of deliberately hoarding supplies in an attempt to raise prices, and said that those found hoarding grain and other commodities would be brought to trial.

    At the same time, the Egyptian government also lifted restrictions on currency exchange in order to promote foreign trade. According to a spokesman, Egypt's assets and foreign exchange have increased, and the reserves it holds are sufficient to meet the needs of purchasing supplies from abroad.

    埃及采取新的措施对付西方经济压力
    新华社29日讯　开罗消息：埃及供应部28日宣布，埃及正在扑灭黑市和囤积粮食的投机分子，作为对付西方的经济压力的全国性运动的一部分。
    供应部指责有些商人故意囤积供应品，企图抬高物价，并且说，囤积粮食和其他商品的人被发现后将提交审讯。
    与此同时，埃及政府也取消了对货币汇兑的限制，以促进对外贸易。据一位发言人说，埃及的资产和外汇已有所增加，掌握的准备金已足以应付向外购买供应品的需要。
