Xinhua News Agency, 26th - The Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China unanimously adopted the Constitution of the Communist Party of China today and elected the members of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China by secret ballot.

The Constitution of the Communist Party of China, which was adopted by the Congress, had been discussed and revised many times by the central and local organizations of the Party for a long time in advance. During the preparatory meeting of the Congress, it was discussed and revised by the representatives, and then passed by the Seventh Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party as a draft to be submitted to the Congress. During the Congress, individual wording revisions were made based on the suggestions of the representatives. When the new Constitution was adopted at the Congress today, the audience burst into long and sustained applause.

The election of the Central Committee took place after the speeches at today's Congress. Before the election of the Central Committee, Executive Chairman Li Fuchun explained: Regarding the election of the members of the Central Committee, each delegation fully discussed it during the preparatory meeting of the Congress, and the candidates were freely proposed by each representative. This nomination did not specify the number of members of the Central Committee, nor did it distinguish between formal members and alternate members. On the basis of this preliminary nomination, according to the decision of the previous Central Committee, the previous Political Bureau and the heads and deputy heads of each delegation studied and discussed the list proposed by each delegation, and proposed the candidate list for the first preliminary election, which was given to each delegation for a secret ballot preliminary election. After the Congress opened, the Presidium of the Congress and the heads and deputy heads of each delegation, according to the results of the first preliminary election, determined the number of formal members and alternate members of the Central Committee to be 170, and divided them into 97 formal Central Committee members and 73 alternate Central Committee members, and then handed them over to each delegation for discussion. After all delegations expressed their agreement with this number and list, a second secret ballot preliminary election was conducted within each delegation. The proposed list of candidates for formal Central Committee members and alternate Central Committee members is based on the results of the second preliminary election of each delegation.

According to the agenda of the Congress, the election of the Central Committee will be conducted in two stages. Today, the 97 formal Central Committee members will be elected first. Tomorrow, the 73 alternate Central Committee members will be elected.

At 5:15 pm, the 1,026 representatives attending today's Congress elected the formal members of the Central Committee by secret ballot.

At today's Congress, the representatives warmly welcomed Song Qingling, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, to deliver a speech. When she walked towards the podium, all the representatives stood up and applauded for a long time.

Song Qingling's speech was constantly interrupted by applause. When she finished her speech, the representatives stood up again and applauded enthusiastically for a long time.

After Song Qingling's speech, the Congress continued to discuss the three reports made by the Party Central Committee. The representatives who spoke were Bao Erhan (Deputy Director of the Nationalities Committee of the National People's Congress), Yang Zhihua (Minister of the Women Workers' Department of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions), Wu Yuzhang (Director of the Chinese Language Reform Committee), Wang Heshou (Director of the State Construction Commission and Minister of the Metallurgical Industry), Yu Guangyuan (Director of the Science Department of the Propaganda Department of the CPC Central Committee), Teng Daiyuan (Minister of Railways), Bai Rubing (Director of the Central Handicraft Administration), and Xu Yunbei (Deputy Minister of Health).

After the representatives spoke, Executive Chairman Li Fuchun obtained the consent of the representatives and announced the end of the Congress discussion.

All the representatives who spoke unanimously expressed their complete agreement with the three reports made by Comrades Liu Shaoqi, Deng Xiaoping, and Zhou Enlai on behalf of the Central Committee; and expressed that after the Eighth National Congress of the Party, all comrades of the Party will surely be able to unite the people of the whole country, ensure the realization of the Party's correct line, and implement the resolutions of this Congress.

    据新华社26日讯　中国共产党第八次全国代表大会今天全体一致地通过了中国共产党章程，并且以无记名投票方式选举了中国共产党第八届中央委员会委员。
    大会通过的中国共产党章程，事先曾经过党的中央和地方组织的长时间讨论和多次修改；在代表大会预备会议期间，又经过代表们的讨论和修改，然后才由党的七届七中全会通过，作为草案提到大会；在大会开会期间，又根据代表们的提议，作了个别文字的修改。当新的章程今天在大会上通过的时候，全场响起了历久不息的掌声。
    关于中央委员会的选举是在今天大会发言结束之后举行的。在选举中央委员会之前，执行主席李富春说明：关于中央委员会委员的选举，在代表大会预备会议期间，曾经过各代表团充分地讨论，并且由各代表自由地提出了候选人。这次提名没有规定中央委员会委员的人数，也没有分别正式委员和候补委员。在这次初步提名的基础上，根据上届中央委员会的决定，由上届政治局和各代表团团长、副团长对于各代表团提出的名单作了研究和讨论，提出了第一次预选的候选名单，交给各代表团进行了无记名投票的预选。在代表大会开会之后，大会主席团和各代表团团长、副团长，根据第一次预选的结果，确定了中央委员会正式委员和候补委员的名额为一百七十人，并且分为正式中央委员九十七人，候补中央委员七十三人，再交给各代表团进行讨论。在各代表团都表示同意这个名额和名单之后，又在各代表团内进行了第二次无记名投票的预选。现在提出的正式中央委员和候补中央委员候选名单，就是根据各代表团第二次预选结果提出来的。

    下午五时十五分，出席今天大会的一千零二十六位代表以无记名投票方式选举了中央委员会正式委员。
    在今天的大会上，代表们热烈欢迎全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长宋庆龄致词。当她走向讲台的时候，代表们全体起立，掌声经久不息。
