Enchanting Music and Graceful Dance
	— After Watching the Performance of the Indonesian Bali Art Troupe —
	Ye Ning
The Indonesian Bali Art Troupe has come to our capital for a visit and performance. When the red velvet curtain was gently drawn open, a vividly colored and striking scene came into view: against the backdrop of a cerulean sky, white clouds drifted; lush green coconut groves and towering pagodas set off a magnificent golden temple. In front of this solemn and beautiful temple, musicians sat on the ground on both sides. Through this picture full of national life, the audience was emotionally led into the realm of religious art.

The overture began, and in a short piece of music, I felt the soul-stirring charm of Balinese music! At the beginning, the golden drums sounded together, full of vigor and momentum, as if putting people on the majestic summit of Bali Mountain, hearing the sea breeze roaring, the tide surging, and the hero's spirit crying out! Suddenly, from the harp and the chalon, beautiful and devout melodies were played, as if someone was chanting silently in the sunset and evening drums, pouring out the hearts of the kind Balinese people. I love this poetic Balinese music, and I love the performing arts of the Balinese national band "Gamelan".

After the overture, the musicians remained sitting in their original seats. The music started again, and dancers, following the music, gracefully appeared from the golden temple. It seems that, like our Peking opera, there are certain rules for entering and exiting the stage. Female performers mostly strike a "pose" after standing still, then separate their hands from their chests to express a pious salute, and then gracefully step down the stairs and come to the middle of the band to dance. Dance and music are integrated into one. This reminds me of the performance style of Tang Dynasty music and dance described in the Dunhuang murals, which is very similar to the performance form of Balinese dance performed on the stage in our country today. This performance form with rich oriental traditional colors is perfect and intimate.

Balinese dance appears before our eyes with distinctive national characteristics. Their clever hands and trembling fingers convey subtle emotions in extremely subtle rhythms. Their eyes, when gazing intently during a pose, are like statues of Buddha. The highly harmonious unity of hands, eyes, head, chest, waist, and footwork constitutes a unique style of curvilinear beauty. The main colors of their crowns, belts, and clothing are gold, red, and yellow. Most dancers wear tight waists and narrow skirts, with bare chests and arms. Overall, Balinese dance has a strong Buddhist style, delicate and moving, and unforgettable!

That night, the performance lasted about two hours, with a total of eight dance programs. There were classical court dances in the "Legong" style, folk dances in the "Kebyar" style, as well as sacrificial dances, mask dances, etc. Each program was exquisite and wonderful, difficult to describe in words.

The new creation "Merak Angelo Dance" by the famous Balinese dancer Nyoman Kalér, and another new type of dance "Tumang Mi Lin Dance" created based on the movements of the classical Dramatari dance, both express the loyalty, bravery, and kindness of historical heroes. They are played by women who embody male characters. The actors have smiles on their faces, showing extraordinary heroism. The dancers left us with an unforgettable image of beauty.

"Parawong Dance" is a very beautiful dance, depicting the story of Parawong falling in love with a fairy. Parawong is played by the male actor Ida Bagus Oka, who performs a solo dance of going out hunting with amazing skill. This solo dance is the crouching Kebyar dance (Balinese Kebyar dance has two forms, crouching and standing. Women playing male characters dance "Kebyar" standing, while men dancing Kebyar are mostly crouching). The leg movements are in a half-squatting state from beginning to end. This requires a high degree of skill to master. The actor's performance is very attractive, conveying extremely rich emotions. Then four fairies floated in, and the prince hid. The fairies came to the lake to bathe and play in the water, combing their hair, and straightening their temples. A series of life-like dance postures that the Chinese audience can deeply appreciate. While the fairies were bathing and playing in the water, the prince secretly stole the fairy clothes of a fairy named Ni Sulashi. Ni Sulashi could not escape after bathing, so the prince proposed to her, and the two became married. When the audience saw this segment, they couldn't help but smile knowingly, because it is similar to the story of the famous Chinese folk myth of the Cowherd and the Weaver Girl, and therefore felt particularly intimate. The fairy Ni Sulashi is played by the famous Balinese folk dancer Ni Lu Chawen. Her slender hands, affectionate eyes, and graceful and charming posture truly give a feeling of astonishment like a swan goose and gracefulness like a dragon, making people yearn.

Another folk sacrificial dance with strong local customs, "Gecak Dance", is a very interesting dance. Without any musical accompaniment, a large group of bare-chested young men sit on the ground around a raging fire, singing the original tunes of "Hoo-ya, Hai-ya, Ho-ya, Cough-ya!", similar to the "mo haozi" of Chinese boatmen. Their bodies sway with the rhythm, slowly kneeling up and raising their hands, as if praying. Then, in a noisy and regular chorus, the Moon God and the Sun God step into the mortal world, and they come among the cheering beings. As they lovingly dance with each other, expressing their admiration and teasing, they are suddenly frightened by the appearance of the Rau God and run away. The dance between the Moon God and the Sun God is danced to the accompaniment of noisy human voices. The actors have a strong sense of rhythm, and even without musical accompaniment, they can still dance very absorbedly. Through this dance, we can imagine the interesting religious life of the Balinese people.

"Sun Ta and Uba Sun Ta Dance" is a dance drama with educational significance, depicting a pair of twin brothers who, in order to compete for a beautiful fairy, develop evil thoughts of mutual jealousy. They fight, and in the end, both become ugly images and perish together. The theme of this dance drama is that any mutual killings caused by evil thoughts among human beings only result in mutual harm. This dance drama reflects the firm belief of the Indonesian people in hating killings and loving peace.

It is said that many excellent actors and musicians of the Bali Art Troupe are amateur artists, which cannot but make us feel even more amazed. This shows that the Balinese people have a high level of art. To understand Balinese dance, which has profound Buddhist content and literary traditions, requires long-term and in-depth study from them. Here, I only express a Chinese dancer's heartfelt admiration for Balinese art and thank the Balinese artists for bringing us sincere friendship.

    仙乐妙舞
    ——印度尼西亚峇厘艺术团演出观后——
    叶宁
    印度尼西亚峇厘艺术团来我国首都访问演出了。当红色的丝绒幕轻轻拉开时，映入眼帘的是一幅色彩鲜明的醒目的画面：在蔚蓝色的天幕上，白云缥缈；浓绿的椰林，高耸的佛塔，衬托出一座金璧辉煌的佛庙，就在这庄严美丽的庙宇门前，乐师们席地坐于两旁。透过这一幅富有民族生活色彩的画面，观众在情感上被引入了宗教艺术的领域。
    序曲开始了，在一首短短的乐曲中，使我感受到峇厘音乐具有激荡人心的魅力！一开始金鼓齐鸣，气势激昂，仿佛使人站到了巍峨的峇厘山顶，听到海风呼啸，浪潮澎湃，英雄的神在呼号！忽而从竖琴、刹龙中奏出了优美虔诚的曲调，仿佛有人在夕阳暮鼓中低吟默祷，倾诉着善良的峇厘人民的心声。我喜欢这富有诗意的峇厘音乐，喜欢峇厘民族乐队“佳美銮”的演奏艺术。
    序曲完了，乐师们仍旧坐在原来的席位上。音乐又开始了，舞者随着音乐，从金璧辉煌的佛庙中飘然登场。看起来似乎和我们的京戏一样，上下场都有一定的格律。女性出场多半是站定“亮相”以后，用两手自胸前分开，表示虔诚的行礼，然后婀娜的步下台阶，来到乐队中间起舞。舞与乐融合一体。这使我联想起我国敦煌壁画中所描叙的唐代乐舞的演出方式，和今天在我国舞台上演出的峇厘舞蹈的演出形式是很相似的。这种富有东方传统色彩的演出形式，令人感到完美而亲切。
    峇厘舞蹈以显著的民族特色出现在我们的眼前，他们那一双巧妙的手，颤动的手指，在极其细微的节奏中传达出微妙的情感。他们的眼神，在亮相凝视的时候，宛若雕塑中的佛像。手、眼、头、胸、腰和步法高度的谐和统一，构成了他们所特有的一种曲线美的风格。他们的冠、带、服装的主要颜色是金色、红色和黄色。舞者多半紧腰窄裙，袒胸露臂。整个说来，峇厘舞蹈是具有浓厚的佛教风格的、纤丽动人，令人难忘！
    那一晚，大约演出了两小时光景，一共有八个舞蹈节目。有“勒刚”风格的宫廷古典舞，也有“克披亚”风格的民间舞，还有祭祀舞、面具舞等，每一个节目都很精致美妙，难以用言语来描述。
    峇厘名舞蹈家约曼·卡勒尔的新创作“默尔卡巴蒂舞”，和另一个根据古典德芒舞蹈的动作而创作的新型舞蹈“德芒米林舞”，都是表现历史上的英雄人物的忠勇、善良的性格的。是由女性扮演男性的。演员面含微笑，表现出英勇非凡的神态。舞蹈家给我们留下了一个难忘的美的形象。
    “巴拉王舞”是一个非常优美的舞蹈，描写巴拉王与仙女恋爱的故事。巴拉王由男演员伊达·巴古斯·奥加饰演，他以惊人的技巧表演了出外打猎的一场独舞。这一场独舞是矮身的克披亚舞（峇厘的克披亚舞有矮身和立身两种形式，女性扮演男性跳“克披亚”都是立身的，男性跳克披亚多半是矮身的）。腿部动作自始至终都是在半蹲状态中。这是需要有高度的技巧才能掌握的，演员的表演很有吸引力，传达出极其丰富的情感。然后四个仙女飘然而来了，王子躲藏起来，仙女来到湖边沐浴戏水，梳发，整鬓，一连串模拟生活的舞姿，中国的观众都能深深体会。仙女们正在沐浴戏水时，王子悄悄地偷走了一位名叫尼·苏拉西的仙女的仙服。尼·苏拉西浴罢无法脱身，于是王子向她求爱，两个人结成了姻缘。观众看到这一段情节时，不觉发出会心的微笑，因为这和我国著名的民间神话牛郎织女的情节相类似，因而特别感到亲切。仙女尼·苏拉西是由峇厘民间著名舞蹈家尼·路·查宛饰演的，她那纤细的双手，含情脉脉的眼神，和婀娜妩媚的体态，诚有惊若鸿雁，婉若游龙之感，令人神往。
    另一个具有浓厚的风土情调的民间祭祀舞蹈“格楂克舞”，是一个很有情趣的舞蹈。没有任何乐器伴奏，一大群光着上身的青年男子，席地坐在熊熊的火焰周围，唱着“吁呀，海呀，嗬呀，咳呀！”的原始曲调，仿佛中国船夫的“么号子”。他们的身体随着节奏晃动，慢慢地跪起来举起双手，好像是在祈祷。继而在嘈杂而有规律的人声轮喊中，月亮神和太阳神步入凡尘，他们来到兴高采烈的众生之中。他们亲爱的对舞着，正在表示彼此的爱慕和逗趣时，忽然被拉乌神的出现而惊跑了。月亮神和太阳神的一段对舞，是在嘈杂的人声伴奏中跳的，演员的节奏感很强，尽管没有乐器伴奏，同样能舞得十分入神。通过这个舞蹈，使我们想像到峇厘人民的有趣的宗教生活。
    “顺达和乌巴顺达舞”是一个带有教育意义的舞剧，描写一对双生兄弟，为争夺一个美丽的仙女，产生了互相嫉妒的恶念，他们打起来了，最后两个人都变成了丑恶的形象，并同归于尽。这个舞剧的主题是：人类之间因任何恶念所引起的残杀，其结果只是两败俱伤。这个舞剧反映了印度尼西亚人民痛恨残杀，热爱和平的坚定信念。
    听说峇厘艺术团的许多优秀演员和乐师，都是业余的艺术家，这不能不使我们感到更加惊异。这说明峇厘人民是具有高度的艺术水平的。要懂得具有深奥的佛学内容和文学传统的峇厘舞蹈是需要长期地深入向他们学习的，在这里我只是表示一个中国的舞蹈工作者对峇厘艺术的衷心爱慕，并答谢峇厘的艺术家们给我们带来的挚诚友谊。
