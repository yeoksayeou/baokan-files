    Shandong Expands Production of Granular Fertilizer
    Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: All twenty-five newly built granular fertilizer factories in Shandong Province have now been put into production. Six larger factories located in cities such as Jinan, Qingdao, Yantai, and Zibo have recently purchased a large number of granulators to expand production. Nine of these have been officially put into production, and the rest are being installed and test-run. The Jinan Granular Fertilizer Factory, in its trial run in early September, found that one machine could produce more than 80,000 jin of granular fertilizer every eight hours, while the old hand-cranked tools could only produce more than 2,000 jin.
    Workers in various factories have launched a production increase competition to produce more base fertilizer for farmers before the autumn planting season. The Jinan Granular Fertilizer Factory recently changed its original one-shift production per day to two shifts, day and night, giving full play to the efficiency of the machinery and equipment, and can now produce more than 160,000 jin of fertilizer per day. It is estimated that the province will supply farmers with a total of 20 million jin of granular fertilizer in September, more than three times the amount in August.
    The granular fertilizer produced by the granular fertilizer factories in various places is of good quality, and its yield-increasing effect is equivalent to that of soybean cake, but the price is cheaper than soybean cake, so it is very popular with agricultural cooperatives in various places. At present, the factories have adopted the method of supplying as they produce, and many agricultural cooperatives transport large quantities of granular fertilizer directly from the factories to the countryside every day.

    山东扩大颗粒肥料生产
    新华社讯　到目前为止，山东省新建的二十五个颗粒肥料厂都已先后投入生产。设立在济南、青岛、烟台、淄博等城市的六个较大规模的厂子，为了扩大生产，最近购进了大批制粒机。其中有九部已正式投入生产，其余的正在安装和试车。济南颗粒肥料厂在9月初试车的结果，一部机器每八小时可产颗粒肥料八万多斤，而旧有的手摇工具，只产二千多斤。
    各厂工人为争取在秋种以前给农民生产出更多的基肥，掀起了增产竞赛。济南颗粒肥料厂最近把原来的每天一班生产改为日夜两班生产，充分发挥了机器设备的效能，每天可生产肥料十六万多斤。预计在9月份全省共能供应农民颗粒肥料二千万斤，比8月份增加三倍以上。
    各地颗粒肥料厂所生产的颗粒肥料质量很好，其增产效能与豆饼相等，但价格却比豆饼便宜，因此，很受各地农业社的欢迎。目前，各厂采取了随生产随供应的办法，每天都有许多农业社把大量颗粒肥料直接从厂里运往农村。
