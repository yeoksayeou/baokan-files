Speech by Comrade Bai Rubing, Director of the Central Handicraft Industry Administration Bureau

I fully agree with Comrade Mao Zedong's opening speech, Comrade Liu Shaoqi's political report, the new Party Constitution and Comrade Deng Xiaoping's report, the suggestions for the Second Five-Year Plan and Comrade Zhou Enlai's report. Now I would like to express the following opinions on several issues in the socialist transformation of handicraft industry.

China's handicraft industry has a long history, complex trades, diverse products, a wide distribution, a broad mass base and excellent technical traditions. It occupies a considerable proportion of the national economy. In 1955, the total output value of handicraft industry accounted for about 18% of the total industrial output value. The products range from simple hairpins and buttons to cotton knitwear, iron and wooden farm tools, and even precision instruments and medical equipment, totaling more than 10,000 kinds. China's arts and crafts are even more exquisite, beautiful and rich in color, and are loved by domestic people and foreign customers. The repair and service industries all over the cities and villages, some with fixed storefronts and some traveling through the streets and villages to provide door-to-door service, are extremely closely related to the daily lives of the people, which shows that handicraft industry has a positive role in serving the production, life and export needs of the people.

Since liberation, the cooperative movement of handicraft industry nationwide has developed year by year under the leadership of the Party. By the end of 1955, more than 2 million handicraftsmen had organized more than 68,000 production cooperatives, supply and marketing production cooperatives and production groups. These cooperative organizations have overcome the various difficulties of the original individual production, developed production, and increased income, which cannot but arouse the desire of the vast number of handicraftsmen for the cooperative system. In addition, affected and promoted by the high tide of agricultural cooperation and the acceleration of the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, a high tide of cooperation in handicraft industry also appeared this spring. By the end of June this year, about 90% of the country's handicraftsmen had been organized. After the handicraftsmen were organized, many regions carried out socialist labor competitions, giving play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the vast number of cooperative members, labor productivity has increased day by day, product quality has been improved in many ways, and product costs have also been reduced. The income of most cooperative members has increased to varying degrees.

China is a country with a population of 600 million. With the continuous improvement of the material and cultural life of urban and rural people, their needs for consumer goods are very large and diverse. On the other hand, China is still an underdeveloped industrial country. Industrial products cannot fully meet the needs of urban and rural people for a considerable period of time. Judging from the current market situation, some industrial products and handicraft products are not too many, but too few. In particular, the supply of small farm tools, small commodities, daily furniture, native paper, bricks and tiles, and some exported arts and crafts is very tight. Some repair and service industries such as sewing, hairdressing, photography, bicycle repair, and watch repair cannot meet the needs of the market. This shows that while the state concentrates its main efforts on building heavy industry and developing light industry, handicraft production should also be appropriately developed. Handicraft industry is an assistant to large industry. The relationship between large industry and handicraft industry is like the relationship between the main force and the guerrillas, which needs to be coordinated. With the development of national industrialization, a considerable part of the handicraft industry should gradually realize semi-mechanized and mechanized production according to needs and possibilities; and some industries, such as embroidery, carving, and various weaving, will still use manual operation for a long time in their main production processes. Therefore, when carrying out economic reorganization and technological transformation, special attention must be paid to maintaining the production and management characteristics of different handicraft industries, and maintaining the necessary division of labor between handicraft industry and large industry. We cannot uniformly require the handicraft industry to follow the example of large industry, transform the repair industry into the manufacturing industry, or squeeze out the complex and diverse small products of handicraft industry.

Developing production, adapting to social needs, and increasing the income of cooperative members are the fundamental symbols of running handicraft cooperatives well. In the high tide of the entire socialist revolution, many new problems have emerged in the internal and external relations of the handicraft industry. These problems are concentrated in economic reorganization, supply and marketing arrangements, and the labor income of cooperative members. In order to better carry out the transformation of the handicraft industry and give play to the production potential of the handicraft industry to supplement the shortage of large industrial products to meet the growing and diverse needs of urban and rural people, it is urgent to study and solve these problems.

I. The Problem of Centralized Production and Decentralized Production

Handicraft industry is small and scattered, flexible in operation, and diverse in products. It can adapt to market changes and consumer needs at any time. They have always had the advantages of caring about the quality, variety and market sales of their products. After the organization, in order to adapt to the ever-changing needs of the market, in addition to some industries suitable for centralized production, the scale of the cooperative should generally be smaller. During the high tide, due to our insufficient understanding of these characteristics and our failure to take into account the needs and convenience of consumers, some areas inappropriately established large cooperatives and multi-industry comprehensive cooperatives, blindly centralized production and unified calculation of profits and losses, so that in some industries, the original supply and marketing relations were disrupted, product quality declined, and product variety decreased. In the repair and service industries, some areas inappropriately abolished and merged service points, which not only caused inconvenience to the masses, but also reduced the income of cooperative members. These mistakes and shortcomings should continue to be corrected.

Centralized production and decentralized production, unified accounting of profits and losses and separate accounting of profits and losses are not only organizational forms, but also a major change in the production and management system. Therefore, the reorganization and transformation work should be carried out prudently from the actual situation according to the situation of different regions and different industries. If the production of the cooperatives that are now concentrated in production rises, the quality improves, the variety increases, and the cost is reduced; and the income of the cooperative members increases and can meet the needs of market development, then of course there is no need to change; if the advantages and disadvantages cannot be seen clearly for a while, and adjustments can be made or not, they should also be temporarily left unchanged, and dealt with after the situation is clarified. However, those that have obvious problems after centralized production should be resolutely divided into small cooperatives and groups with preparation and steps, and they should be calculated separately; some households should also be allowed to carry out decentralized production and assume their own profits and losses. Whether it is a large cooperative, a small cooperative, a group, or a decentralized management household under the leadership of the cooperative, as long as there is no exploitation, it should be regarded as socialist in nature.

II. The Supply and Marketing Problem of Handicraft Industry

Handicraft industry is an economy with great local characteristics, and most of the raw materials it needs are obtained locally. About 75% of handicraft products are produced and sold locally, and only about 25% are sold nationwide and abroad. Since the agricultural and handicraft cooperation and the joint state-private ownership of capitalist industry and commerce, the free market has basically been eliminated, and the original habits of handicraftsmen to purchase raw materials and sell their own products have been subject to various restrictions, and even the purchase of bamboo, grass, rattan, willow, and palm silk used for weaving has been greatly affected. The state's unified allocation of materials such as steel has also been excessively compressed for handicraft cooperatives this year, so that many cooperatives in some areas have experienced shutdowns waiting for materials, especially the supply of small farm tools and daily metal appliances is very tight.

In order to enable handicraft cooperatives and individual handicraftsmen to produce more and better products, and to reduce their costs, various local raw materials and waste products should be allowed to purchase and use them by themselves. Commercial departments should provide convenience for their supply of raw materials. The state's unified allocation of materials needed by handicraft cooperatives should be incorporated into the local industrial plan as soon as possible, and balanced and resolved by the provincial, municipal, and county (city) planning commissions. If the products of handicraft cooperatives are produced and sold locally, most of them can be sold by the grassroots cooperatives themselves, or they can directly establish sales relationships with industrial and mining enterprises, agricultural cooperatives, etc., without going through commercial links; those sold far away should be selected and sold by commercial departments on commission or sold by the handicraft cooperatives themselves; those exported should be signed directly by the handicraft cooperatives and foreign trade departments. Products that belong to the state's unified purchase, if conditions permit to change processing to ordering, should be changed to ordering as much as possible. Only in this way can we maintain the operating characteristics of the handicraft industry, increase the variety of designs and colors, and better play the initiative of production of grassroots cooperatives.

III. The Wage Income and Labor Insurance Welfare of Cooperative Members

How to correctly handle the relationship between the collective and the individual in the distribution of income of handicraft cooperative organizations is an important issue in doing a good job in handicraft production. At present, the wage income of cooperative members of handicraft cooperatives and groups is generally still low, and at the same time, the income of about 20% of cooperative members has decreased compared with before joining the cooperative due to the excessive public accumulation of the cooperative and other reasons. The labor insurance and welfare work of cooperative organizations is also relatively poor. The problem of medical treatment for diseases of cooperative members themselves has not yet been solved in general, and many people still have difficulties in their lives. Some cooperative members say: "Workers have labor insurance, farmers have five guarantees, and we have none." This is an issue that should attract our serious attention.

In order to give play to the enthusiasm and creativity of handicraft workers, develop production, and increase income, in addition to adhering to the principle of "running the cooperative diligently and thriftily," where the enthusiasm of cooperative members is affected due to over-concentration of organization and excessive accounting units, production should be appropriately decentralized and profits and losses should be calculated separately; where income is affected due to the abolition and merger of service points, it should be appropriately restored; where the life of cooperative members is affected due to the improper arrangement of family auxiliary labor, appropriate arrangements should be made; where the income of cooperative members is affected due to the shortening of working hours, appropriate adjustments should be made; where the cooperative relationship is disrupted and the unified arrangement is affected, efforts should be made to restore and adjust; where the work-payment fee and the purchase price are too low, requests should be made to adjust them; where raw materials are insufficient and sales are subject to unreasonable restrictions, requests should be made to solve them; where egalitarianism and non-payment for labor exist in wages, they should be evaluated according to the level of technology. The distribution of income of handicraft cooperative organizations should be adjusted quickly according to the principle of "wages first, then medical treatment and relief, and accumulation only if there is a surplus." In short, we must try every means to strive to increase the labor income of 90% of the cooperative members compared with before joining the cooperative; for a small number of cooperatives that are still having difficulties, we must also strive to increase the income of 70% of the cooperative members; the majority of the remaining cooperative members should also strive to achieve no reduction in income. The wages of handicraftsmen should be appropriately adjusted within this year. In the future, the labor insurance and welfare of handicraft cooperative organizations should, according to the specific conditions of the cooperative, extract additional wages equivalent to 5% to 10% of the total wages and include them in the product cost as the general medical expenses of the cooperative members themselves, the subsidized wages for sick leave and maternity leave, and the subsidized expenses for cooperative members' families with serious living difficulties. Among them, a part can be extracted and handed over to the trade union or the higher-level joint cooperative to run unified medical care.

Handicraft industry is a component of local industry. In local industry below the special district and county, the output value of handicraft industry accounts for 80% to 90%, and in provinces (autonomous regions) it generally accounts for 30% to 50%. Comrade Liu Shaoqi instructed us in his political report that "some cooperative organizations will develop into state-owned enterprises or merge into state-owned enterprises under appropriate conditions," so that when the state builds and expands local small and medium-sized industries, it can fully utilize the production potential of handicraft cooperatives, and closely combine handicraft industry with local state-owned industry and joint state-private industry to carry out unified arrangements and overall planning in terms of economic reorganization, production arrangement, basic construction and labor force allocation. Developing local industry on the basis of existing handicraft industry not only requires less investment, yields quick results, and achieves twice the result with half the effort, but also can achieve better coordination between large industry and small industry. This is not only conducive to the development of national industrialization, but also conforms to the vital interests and aspirations of the vast number of handicraft workers.

The relationship between handicraft industry and local industry, agriculture, commerce, etc. is very close. It is difficult or even impossible to do a good job in production by simply managing it by the handicraft industry department. In order to facilitate the timely solution of problems in accordance with local conditions, in addition to re-dividing the scope of handicraft industry transformation that was inappropriately divided in the past, the production and transformation of handicraft industry in the future must rely on the leadership of local party committees. It is required that party committees at all levels effectively strengthen the leadership of the handicraft industry department, regularly inspect their work, and help them solve the difficulties and problems in their work. Only when party committees at all levels directly grasp the work of handicraft industry and plan and arrange it as a component of local industry, can it be convenient to mobilize the positive factors of all relevant parties and quickly and healthily complete the historical task of socialist transformation of handicraft industry.

### 手工业内部和外部关系上的新问题

    手工业内部和外部关系上的新问题
    中央手工业管理局局长　白如冰同志的发言
    毛泽东同志的开幕词、刘少奇同志的政治报告、新的党章和邓小平同志的报告、第二个五年计划的建议和周恩来同志的报告，我完全同意。现在我就手工业社会主义改造工作中的几个问题，发表如下意见。
    我国手工业历史悠久，行业复杂，产品多样，分布面广，具有广泛的群众基础和优秀的技术传统，在国民经济中占有相当的比重，一九五五年全国手工业产值占工业总产值的百分之十八左右。产品从简单的发卡、钮扣到棉针织品、铁木农具以至精密的仪器和医疗器械等，不下万余种。我国的工艺美术品，更是精致美观，丰富多采，为国内人民和国外顾客所喜爱。遍布城乡的修理服务行业，有的设有固定的门面，有的串街游乡，服务上门，与人民日常生活的关系极为密切，这就说明，手工业在为人民生产、生活和出口需要服务等方面，都具有积极的作用。
    解放以来，全国手工业合作化运动，在党的领导下逐年均有发展。到一九五五年底，全国已有二百多万手工业者组织了六万八千多个生产合作社、供销生产社和生产小组。这些合作组织克服了原来个体生产时的各种困难，发展了生产，增加了收入，这就不能不引起广大手工业者对合作制的向往，加上农业合作化的高潮和资本主义工商业社会主义改造加快的影响和推动，手工业今春也出现了合作化的高潮。到今年六月底止，全国组织起来的手工业者约占手工业者总数的百分之九十左右。手工业者组织起来以后，不少地区都开展了社会主义劳动竞赛，发挥了广大社、组员的积极性和创造性，劳动生产率日有提高，产品质量多有改进，产品成本也有所降低，大部分社员的收入有不同程度的增加。
    我国是一个六亿人口的国家，随着城乡人民物质文化生活的不断提高，他们对消费品的需要是很大的，而且是多种多样的；另一方面，我国又是一个工业还不发达的国家，工业产品在一个相当长的时期内，还不能充分满足城乡人民的需要。从目前市场情况看，若干工业产品和手工业产品，不是多了，而是少了。特别是小农具、小百货、日用家具、土纸、砖瓦以及某些出口的工艺美术品等，供应都很紧张。一部分修理服务行业如缝纫、理发、照相、自行车修理、钟表修理等，都不能适应市场的需要。这就说明，国家在集中主要力量建设重工业和发展轻工业的同时，手工业生产也应当适当发展。手工业是大工业的助手，大工业和手工业的关系，正如主力军和游击队的关系一样，需要配合作战。随着国家工业化的发展，手工业中有相当的一部分行业，应该根据需要和可能，逐步实现半机械化和机械化生产；也有一部分行业如刺绣、雕刻、各种编织等，其主要生产过程仍将长时期采用手工操作。因此，在进行经济改组和技术改造的时候，必须特别注意保持手工业不同行业的生产经营特点，保持手工业与大工业之间应有的分工，不能千篇一律地要求手工业向大工业看齐，变修理业为制造业，或者挤掉手工业复杂多样的小产品。
    发展生产，适应社会需要，增加社员收入，是办好手工业合作社的根本标志。在整个社会主义革命高潮中，手工业的内部和外部关系上出现了许多新的问题，这些问题，集中地表现在经济改组、供销安排，以及社员的劳动收入等方面。为了更好地搞好对手工业的改造工作，发挥手工业的生产潜力，补助大工业产品的不足，以适应城乡人民日益增长的多种多样的需要，急需对这些问题加以研究和解决。
    一、集中生产和分散生产问题
    手工业小而分散，经营灵活，产品多种多样，能够随时适应市场变化和消费者的需要，他们历来就有关心自己产品质量、品种花色和市场销路的优点。组织起来以后，为了适应市场千变万化的需要，除了一部分行业适宜于集中生产而外，合作社的建社规模一般宜于小些。高潮中，由于我们对这些特点认识不足，未能很好地考虑消费者的需要和便利，有些地区就出现了不适当地办大社、办多行业的综合社，盲目地集中生产和统一计算盈亏，以致在有些行业中原有的供销关系被打乱了，产品质量下降了，品种花色减少了。在修理服务行业中，有的地区不适当地撤销和合并服务点，既造成群众不便，又使社员收入减少。这些错误和缺点，应该继续加以纠正。
    集中生产和分散生产，统一核算盈亏和分别核算盈亏，不仅是组织形式的问题，而且是生产和经营制度上的一项重大变革。因此，应该根据不同地区和不同行业的情况，从实际出发，稳妥地进行改组改造工作。现在集中生产的合作社，如果产量上升，质量提高，品种增加，成本降低；社员收入增加，又能适应市场发展需要的，当然就不要变动；如果一时利弊还看不清楚，可调整可不调整的，亦应暂时不动，待摸清情况后再作处理。但对那些集中生产以后显然有毛病的，则应该坚决地有准备、有步骤地划为小社、小组，并且应当单独核算；有的户还应当允许其分散生产，自负盈亏。不论是大社、小社、小组，或合作社领导下的分散经营户，只要是没有剥削，都应该看作是社会主义性质的。
    二、手工业的供销问题
    手工业是带有很大地方性的经济，其所需的原材料极大部分都是就地取材。手工业产品中就地生产就地销售的约占百分之七十五左右，销售于全国范围和国外的只占百分之二十五左右。自农业、手工业合作化和资本主义工商业公私合营以后，自由市场已基本消灭，手工业者原来自购原料和自销产品的习惯，随之受到种种限制，甚至连编织所用的竹、草、藤、柳、棕丝的采购，也都受到了很大的影响。国家统一分配的钢铁等材料，今年对手工业合作社的压缩亦过多，以致不少地区的合作社已发生停工待料现象，尤其是小农具和日用金属器具的供应非常紧张。
    为了使手工业合作社和个体手工业者能生产更多更好的产品，并能降低其成本，各种地方原料和废品废料应该允许他们自购自用。商业部门对他们的原材料供应，应该给予便利。手工业合作社所需要的国家统一分配物资，应尽快地纳入地方工业计划之内，由省市、县市计划委员会平衡解决。手工业合作社的产品，如果是就地生产就地销售的，大多数可以由基层社自销，也可以直接与工矿企业、农业合作社等建立销售关系，不必经过商业环节；远销的由商业部门选购、代销或者由手工业合作社自销；出口的由手工业合作社直接和对外贸易部门签订合同。属于国家统购的产品，有条件改加工为订货的，尽可能改为订货。只有这样，才能保持手工业经营的特点，增加花色品种，更好地发挥基层社生产的积极性。
    三、社员工资收入和劳保福利问题
    手工业合作组织在收益分配上如何正确处理集体与个人之间的关系，是搞好手工业生产的一个重要问题。目前手工业合作社、组员的工资收入，一般的还较低，同时约有百分之二十左右社员的收入，因合作社的公共积累偏多以及其他各种原因，比入社前有所减少。合作组织的劳保福利工作也比较差，社、组员本人的疾病医疗问题一般还没有得到解决，不少人的生活尚有困难，有的社、组员说：“工人有劳保，农民有五保，我们无一保”。这是应该引起我们严重注意的问题。
    为了发挥手工业劳动者的积极性、创造性，发展生产，增加收入，除坚持“勤俭办社”的原则外，凡因组织过于集中，核算单位过大而影响社员积极性的，应当适当分散生产，分别计算盈亏；因撤销和合并服务点而影响收益的，应当适当恢复；因家庭辅助劳动力未作妥善安排而影响社员生活的，应给予适当安排；因工作时间缩短了而影响社员收入的，应当适当调整；因协作关系被打断而影响统一安排的，应当设法恢复和调整；工缴费和收购价过低的，要求予以调整；原料不足和销售受到不合理限制的，要求予以解决；工资中存在的平均主义、不按劳付酬的，应当按照技术高低加以评定。手工业合作组织的收益分配，应当根据“先工资、后治病救济，有剩余才积累”的原则，迅速进行调整。总之，要想尽方法争取百分之九十的社员的劳动收入比入社前有所增加；少数目前还有困难的合作社，也要争取百分之七十的社员增加收入；其余社员的大部分，也要争取做到不减少收入。手工业者的工资，在今年内要作适当的调整。手工业合作组织的劳保福利，今后应根据合作社的具体条件，提取相当于工资总额百分之五至十的附加工资，列入产品成本，作为社员本人的一般疾病医疗费用、病假和产假的补助工资以及社员家庭生活严重困难的补助费。其中可提取一部分交工会或上级联社举办统筹医疗。
    手工业是地方工业的组成部分，专区和县以下的地方工业中，手工业的产值占百分之八十至九十，省（自治区）一般也占到百分之三十至五十。刘少奇同志在政治报告中指示我们：“一部分的合作组织在适当的条件下，将要发展成为国营企业或者并入国营企业”，这样在国家新建、扩建地方中小型工业的时候，就能够充分运用手工业合作社的生产潜力，把手工业和地方国营工业及公私合营工业密切结合起来，在经济改组、生产安排、基本建设和劳动力调配等方面，进行统一安排和全面规划。在现有手工业的基础上发展地方工业，不仅投资小、收效快，事半功倍，而且可以取得大工业和小工业的更好配合。这不仅有利于国家工业化的发展，而且也符合广大手工业劳动者的切身利益和愿望。
    手工业和当地工业、农业、商业等方面的关系非常密切，单独由手工业部门一揽子管起来，要把生产搞好，是有困难的，甚至是不可能的。为了便于因地制宜地及时解决问题，除过去对手工业改造范围划分得不适当的，应当重新加以划分外，今后对手工业的生产和改造工作，必须依靠地方党委的领导，要求各级党委切实加强对手工业部门工作的领导，经常地对他们的工作进行检查，帮助他们解决工作中的困难和问题。只有各级党委把手工业工作直接抓起来，把它当作地方工业的一个组成部分来规划和安排，才便于调动各有关方面的积极因素，迅速而健康地彻底完成手工业社会主义改造的历史任务。
