After reading the report "Was it Suicide Out of Fear of Punishment? Or Death Bearing a Wrong?" in the People's Daily on September 8th, I had many thoughts: In this new society that cherishes people and enhances human dignity in every way, there are still such "directors" and "secretaries" who "abuse their power" and "treat human life as worthless"! Indignant, I thought of some ancient people. Everyone knows Kuang Zhong in "Fifteen Strings of Cash," but there were many other good people and deeds that valued human life besides Kuang Zhong. This is not about expressing some "nostalgia for the past," but simply feeling that there are some things we can learn from the ancients.

During the Xianping era of the Song Dynasty, Ouyang Guan, the father of Ouyang Xiu, served as a judicial officer in Sizhou. Whenever he had to judge a death penalty case, he would always frown and walk around the room, trying to find a way to prevent the person from dying. His wife saw him in this state and asked him why he was pacing around so anxiously. Ouyang Guan replied to her, "If I have done my best and really can't find a way to save him from death, then if he dies, neither he nor I will have any regrets. But generally, if you often try to find a way to acquit him, he still ends up dying; how much more so if you don't put your heart into studying the case and easily sentence him to death?"

You see, what a humane person this is, and what humane words he speaks?

Here's another story from the Song Dynasty:

During the Jianyan era of the early Southern Song Dynasty, Jiao Huan went to the capital to take the imperial examinations. On the way, the female owner of the inn where he stayed lost a gold ring, which was picked up by Jiao Huan's servant. When they left the inn, the servant didn't mention picking up the ring; it was only after they had traveled for a few days that he told Jiao Huan about it. Upon hearing this, Jiao Huan immediately wanted to go back and return the ring to the female owner. Someone said to him, "The examination is near, no need to rush back to return it; wouldn't it delay the examination! It's not too late to return it after the examination." But Jiao Huan said, "Hmm?! If this female owner loses the ring, she will surely suspect the poor workers under her, and beat and force them. If pushed too far, those who are forced will jump into the river or hang themselves! This kind of thing is bound to happen! I can't bear to delay someone's life for the sake of 'passing the examination.'"

They hurried back to return the ring to the female owner, and when they hurried to the capital again, the examination period had indeed passed. However, coincidentally, the examination hall caught fire, postponing the original examination date, so he was still able to participate in the examination and even became the top scholar. At the time, people composed two lines of verse saying, "If it weren't for the fire at the examination hall, how could Jiao have become the top scholar?!" (Some people attribute this story to Jiao Hong of the Ming Dynasty.)

This story may have some embellishment, but it is mainly factual. This story shows that Jiao Huan had a kind heart, and his judgment of human affairs was also extremely thorough and accurate. He had a good heart and did a good deed bravely and promptly. Isn't this spirit worth learning from by modern people?

    读了一篇报道之后
    阎简弼
    看了9月8日人民日报上“是畏罪自杀？还是含冤而死？”这篇报道之后，我有很多感想：在这样珍视人、从各方面提高人的尊严的新社会里，竟而还有这种“擅作威福”、“草菅人命”的“主任”、
  “书记”！愤愤之余，我想起一些古人来。“十五贯”里的况钟是大家知道的，而况钟之外的重视人命的好人好事，也不少见。这倒不是发什么“思古之幽情”，无非觉得有些地方向古人也可以学习的。
    欧阳修的父亲欧阳观，在咸平中为泗州推官。凡是要批断一椿死狱的时候，他总是皱着眉头，在屋里走来走去地，想方法看能不能使他不至于死。他的夫人看见他这种情况，就问他为了什么那样儿转磨苦思？欧阳观就对她说：“我要是尽了我最大的努力，实在找不到可以救免他一死的办法时，那他死了，他本人和我都不会觉得有什么遗憾。而一般是：你常常想法去解脱他，还是弄得他不免一死；况说你不用心钻研，而轻易地把他断成死罪？”
    您看，这人是多么有人味儿的人，话又是多么富于人味儿的话？
    还有一件宋朝的事：
    南宋初建炎年间，焦焕到京城去赶考。途中所投的客栈的女店主丢了一个金戒指，被焦焕的仆人拣到了。他们离开客栈时，仆人没有提拣到个戒指的事儿；而走了几天之后，他才向焦焕说了。焦焕听了，立刻就要赶回去把戒指送还女店主。有人就跟他说：“考期就到了，不必忙着去送还；不看误了考试！考完了再送还她去，也不为迟。”焦焕却说：“嗯？！这个女店主丢了戒指，准得怀疑她手下的苦伙计，要捶打追逼他。逼急了，那被逼的会去投河或者上吊的！这种事情是一定要发生的！我不忍为了自己‘中一第’，而耽误了人家一条命。”
    赶他们赶回去把戒指还了女店主，再赶到京城时，考期真的已经过了。可是，碰巧因为考场着了火，把原定考期挪后了，所以他仍然得以参加考试，而且考了个状元。当时人们编了两句词儿说：“不因场屋火，怎得状元焦？！”（这件事也有人归之于明朝的焦竑的。）
    这件事，可能有部分渲染，但主要是事实。这件事说明了：焦焕既然心肠忠厚，而且对人情事理的推断也极为透彻确切。有着好心肠，又勇毅而及时地办了件好事。这种精神难道不值得现代人学习吗？
