Why Guo Junquan Rose and Fell Three Times
Wang Wenxiu

Guo Junquan is an old worker with sixteen years of experience in the forging workshop of Fushun Steel Plant. In the eight years since liberation, he has enjoyed the honor of being an advanced producer, and he has also suffered inexplicable blows. The leadership has sometimes praised him to the skies and sometimes crushed him to the ground. What is the reason for this? No one has ever studied it in the past.

When Fushun was liberated, Guo Junquan was the production team leader in the grinding section of the forging workshop. Because he often found tricks to improve production, everyone elected him as a representative to attend the first Fushun City Industrial Labor Model Conference in 1949. At this time, Guo Junquan was just like the old worker Ma Shouting said: "At that time, Little Guo was very energetic, and Director Jiang of our workshop even wanted to marry his daughter to him!"

Guo Junquan is stubborn and upright. He doesn't know how to flatter, nor does he obey blindly. As long as he sees any shortcomings in the leadership, he will bluntly point them out. For example, at that time, the workshop director's brother-in-law changed from a bricklayer to the forging workshop. He was not skilled, but he was placed in the position of a planner and received the salary of an eighth-grade worker. Guo Junquan said "strange things": "How can these relatives of the emperor be so popular!" This pricked the sore spot of some cadres. So in the eyes of some cadres, Guo Junquan began to become a "difficult" worker.

Of course, Guo Junquan has shortcomings, and some shortcomings are very serious. He believes that he has a good set of skills, so he looks down on others and often says: "Except for Director Wang, I dare to challenge anyone (meaning to compete)." Therefore, in 1951, when he went to the No. 3 hammer as deputy squad leader, he did not get along well with the squad leader Zhao Weidong. For example, once when forging axle steel, the squad leader asked him to use a little less force. Guo Junquan thought, "With so many tasks, how can we complete them if we do it slowly?" So he kept nodding to the hammer operator, signaling him to hit it faster. As a result, because he used too much force, a steel material was made into a waste product. When the workers saw that the axle steel was broken, they gathered around the waste product to find the reason. Guo Junquan thought, "If it's broken, just remember this lesson," and shouted, "What are you looking at? Isn't it waste anyway? Hurry up and work."

The duty director knew about these situations. Without analyzing the specific situation, he thought that Guo Junquan broke the steel and didn't feel sorry for it, and reported the situation to the branch. The branch secretary, Li Yunpeng (who has now been transferred), talked to Guo Junquan and Zhao Weidong, on the one hand, to resolve the opinions between the squad leader and the deputy squad leader, and on the other hand, to study the reason for the scrap axle steel. Li Yunpeng said: "Squad Leader Guo has contributed a lot to us and has been of great help to production..." This roundabout way of Li Yunpeng aroused Guo Junquan's antipathy. He thought: "We were brothers who suffered together during the puppet Manchukuo period. Today, you are the branch secretary and you are talking to me like an official. If you want to criticize, just criticize directly, why bother with this?" So he blurted out: "Don't give me that 'show-off' (meaning don't talk nonsense)." Guo Junquan felt very stuffy about everyone saying that he didn't feel sorry for breaking the material, and thought, "I called for quick work for the sake of production, it's better to keep silent and follow the crowd." Then he said: "From now on, I won't care about anything, I'll just be a donkey in the mill and listen to orders..."

A cadre of the trade union knew about this matter. He listened to one side of the story, did not analyze the reasons well, and wrote an article for the Workers' Daily. The workshop branch secretary and the duty director, holding the attitude of "criticizing him in the newspaper and seeing what else he can do," supported this approach. The Workers' Daily did not delve into the situation and launched a critical discussion in the newspaper under the title "Is Guo Junquan's Work Attitude Correct?" This was indeed a heavy blow to Guo Junquan. His wife said: "At that time, Lao Guo was like he was possessed, restless all day, and didn't say a word. Every time he moved, I followed him worried, fearing that something would go wrong!"

The discussion in the newspaper became more and more heated, and workers from all over the country expressed their opinions on this forum. The Workers' Daily finally sent all these letters to Guo Junquan. These letters were more than two feet thick when stacked, but no workers in the factory participated in the discussion. When the discussion in the newspaper was about to end, the Workers' Daily asked the forging workshop branch for Guo Junquan's self-criticism. Guo Junquan, filled with a belly of grievances, said angrily: "Whoever is the local emperor should make a self-criticism, I won't write!" The then Youth League secretary saw that the discussion in the Workers' Daily could not come to an end, so he wrote a self-criticism on behalf of Guo Junquan, which was considered a task accomplished.

At this time, Guo Junquan's position as deputy squad leader was also removed. Guo Junquan felt that he had "fallen head over heels for no reason." He thought, "Anyway, the leader says who is good, who is good, and who is bad, who is bad," and felt wronged for a long time.

Guo Junquan seemed to have figured out the rules of the leadership. Sure enough, the time for him to be called "good" came. In 1954, the factory's requirements for product quality were raised, and the production situation in the forging workshop was very bad. In order to break through this barrier, the leadership consciously focused on the finished product hammer that had a decisive significance for completing the task—the No. 3 hammer. Therefore, Guo Junquan's team received the care of the leadership again. As Guo Junquan said: "At this time, the leadership really supports us. Lao Liu, the trade union production cadre, often came to my house to chat and inquire about the production situation, and the rationalization proposals we put forward can also be resolved in a timely manner." With the support of the leadership, coupled with Guo Junquan's skilled technology and the efforts of all the workers in the team, they overfulfilled the task by 50% on a certain day in April, creating the highest record for forging. Thus, Guo Junquan, who had once been criticized as a "local emperor," won the honor of creating a new record. The factory knocked on gongs and drums to send good news, issued prizes, and also established Guo Junquan as a banner for the entire factory. They also organized Guo Junquan to record experience on the radio. Happy events make people refreshed. Guo Junquan's heart was really like a flower blooming. Every day after work, he and his wife always had laughter and jokes. Soon, the city's Women's Federation also published the story of how Guo Junquan's wife, Zhang Yuzhen, managed the housework and helped Guo Junquan. Guo Junquan was very happy when he saw it, and joked with his wife: "The stars follow the moon, I am good, and you are also praised." The family was full of a happy atmosphere.

After Guo Junquan's team became an advanced production team, everyone worked very hard. Guo Junquan thought: "We must maintain this honor!" However, in their busy pursuit of production tasks, their team gradually neglected safety. Therefore, one day in October, a major mechanical accident occurred due to violation of operating procedures—the tie rod broke, and then in December, another tie rod broke.

These accidents are inseparable from Guo Junquan's pride and complacency in his thinking. However, during this period, no party organization from the workshop to the factory had conducted beneficial criticism and education for Guo Junquan's team. After the accident, no one went to calmly analyze the cause of the accident, but immediately started counting old scores, even including the tie rod that their team broke in February (before the new record was created). Without distinguishing right from wrong, a punishment notice was issued. When the yellow velvet coat with five big red characters of "New Record Creator" that the factory awarded to Guo Junquan had not yet faded, Guo Junquan was demoted by one grade again. As for the objective factors that caused the accident, such as the lack of fixed specifications for the tie rods manufactured in the workshop at that time, and the old marks on the tie rods due to the three-shift rotation, the leadership did not consider them, as if these were not related to the handling of the accident.

At the beginning of May this year, when the wages for April were issued, Guo Junquan received a notice of wage deduction, but the other two teams were not deducted. What is even more incomprehensible is that the results of the April competition showed that Guo Junquan's team performed better than the other two teams. From the perspective of the ranking of the five production competition conditions (output, quality, cost, attendance rate, and savings amount) of the entire work section, Guo Junquan's team was eleventh; the other two teams were twelfth and fourteenth respectively. The completion of the quality indicators was: Guo Junquan's team completed 99%; the other two teams completed 98.5%, one of which was the same as Guo Junquan's team. This made Guo Junquan feel unfair. After work, he went to the quality supervision station (hereinafter referred to as the supervision station) to inquire about the reason. Zhao Weidong, the head of the supervision station, said: "We only report scrap products to the workshop and do not care about wage deductions." He also found the workshop, but no one paid attention to him here. Guo Junquan had nowhere to appeal, so he said angrily to the cadres: "You only know how to deduct wages, right? Deduct it!" Guo Junquan was angry, and production was inevitably affected. Coincidentally, the next day, as soon as he went to work, he made two "small rulers" (smaller than the standard size) with scars. The inspector asked him to grind the "ratezi" (tool). Guo Junquan thought: "What do you little kid know? Where is the problem? I know better than you with my eyes closed." He believed that the problem was not on the "ratezi," but on the hammer operator's failure to find the right strength, so he signaled the hammer operator to hit it a little less, completely ignoring the inspector's suggestion. Guo Junquan was wrong about this. Although making "small rulers" was the hammer operator's problem, the scars on the steel were indeed caused by the "ratezi." The inspector had no choice but to report to the head of the supervision station. Zhao immediately reported to the workshop by telephone, and the deputy director of the workshop immediately asked the foreman to stop Guo Junquan's work. This incident alarmed Zhang, the deputy chief engineer of the factory. He suggested: "This worker's individualism is too serious and should be announced throughout the factory!" He wanted to make a big show of criticizing him as a typical example, but he did not do so after the suggestion of the working group of the Provincial Party Committee Propaganda Department.

However, the leadership's view of Guo Junquan did not change in the slightest. When Guo Junquan failed to complete the task continuously from January to May this year, he repeatedly raised difficulties to the leadership and suggested not to arbitrarily transfer technical forces. The leadership believed that "Guo Junquan always calls for difficulties and refuses to use his strength." In fact, the failure of the No. 3 hammer to complete the task is closely related to the backward management of the workshop, but the leadership does not consider these. Instead, they came up with a new "measure" to promote Han Guozhi, a sixth-grade worker (Party member), to replace Guo Junquan. They believed that Han Guozhi had high political enthusiasm and organizational ability, and could completely lead everyone to complete the task. This would not only change the current situation that the No. 3 hammer could not complete the task, but also educate Guo Junquan, wouldn't it be killing two birds with one stone? So Guo Junquan was transferred to the No. 4 hammer for no apparent reason. Guo Junquan's mood at this time was just like his wife said: "I don't know why, Lao Guo doesn't like to talk after work anymore. If I ask him about the production situation in the factory, he will hum once if he is happy, and if he is not happy, he will say 'Go away, what do you know!' From then on, I didn't ask him anymore." In this way, Guo Junquan was thrown down again.

Facts speak louder than words. After Han Guozhi arrived at the No. 3 hammer, the production situation did not improve at all. After Guo Junquan was transferred to the No. 4 hammer, due to the better equipment conditions, he was generally able to complete the production task. Especially on a certain day in June, four workers were absent and waited for materials for one hour and twenty-five minutes. As a result, he still overfulfilled the task by 1% while ensuring quality. It can be seen that the problem with the No. 3 hammer is not whether it is led by Guo Junquan or Han Guozhi. Smart leaders should draw useful lessons from this fact, but the leading cadres of the forging workshop still do not have a correct attitude towards Guo Junquan. They do not examine their own shortcomings in their work, but excessively emphasize Guo Junquan's shortcomings. Although Guo Junquan has a more serious sense of pride, he is basically clear about the relationship between personal interests and collective interests, and is willing to do a good job, and generally speaking, he has the ability to do a good job, and he also demands progress politically. This year, in the high tide of national socialist construction, Guo Junquan found the Party branch and submitted an application to join the Party. However, how did the Party branch treat the old worker's request to join the Party? The following is a dialogue between him and the branch organization member.

“I want to join the Communist Party.”
“What do you know about the Communist Party?”
“I think the Communist Party is the vanguard of the working class.”
“Why didn't you think about joining earlier?”
“I was afraid that I didn't meet the requirements, so I'm trying it out now.”
“What are you saying! Trying, — still no determination.”

Guo Junquan couldn't say all the words in his heart that he yearned for the Communist Party. He walked out of the branch office in a state of anxiety, and "trying to apply" became a joke for the branch members to chat about. As for what kind of help they should give Guo Junquan, no one considered it.

Why did Guo Junquan rise and fall three times? Obviously, in addition to his own shortcomings, the Party organization of this factory bears a serious responsibility.

    郭俊全为什么三起三落
    王文秀
    郭俊全是抚顺钢厂锻钢车间一个有十六年工龄的老工人。他在解放以来的八年中，曾享有过先进生产者的荣誉，也曾遭受过莫名其妙的打击。领导上对他真是有时候捧之上天，有时候压之入地。这究竟是因为什么呢？过去是没有人加以研究的。
    抚顺解放时，郭俊全在锻钢车间研磨工段当生产小组长，由于经常找窍门改进生产，1949年大家公推他为代表，参加了抚顺市第一届工业劳动模范会议。这时的郭俊全，正像老工人马守廷说的那样：“那时小郭可带劲了，我们车间姜主任都想把女儿嫁给他呢！”
    郭俊全性格倔强，为人正派，他不会阿谀逢迎，也不会百依百顺，他只要看到领导上有什么缺点，就直言不讳地提出来。比如，当时车间主任的内弟，从瓦工改行到锻钢车间，本来技术不高却安插了个计划员的位置，拿八级工的工资，郭俊全便讲“怪话”：“这些皇亲国舅怎么这么吃得开呢！”这就刺到了某些干部的痛处。于是在某些干部的眼里，郭俊全开始成了“难调理”的工人。
    当然，郭俊全是有缺点的，有些缺点还很严重。他认为自己技术上有一套，便看不起别人，常说：“除了王主任，那个都敢蹓一蹓（较量高低的意思）。”因此在1951年当他到三号锤当副班长时，同班长赵韦栋处得不好。比如一次打车轴钢，班长叫使小点劲打，郭俊全想：“这么多的任务，慢慢干怎么能完成？”便一个劲向开锤工点头示意叫快打，结果因为使劲太大，一根钢材打成了废品。工人们见打废了车轴钢，便围着废品找原因。郭俊全想：“打坏了记住这个教训就得了呗”，便大喊：“你们看着它干啥呢？看，不也是废了吗？还不快干。”
    这些情况被值班主任知道了。他不分析具体情况，便认为郭俊全打坏了钢材又不心疼，把情况反映到支部，支部书记李云鹏（现已调走）找郭俊全和赵韦栋谈话，一方面解决正副班长之间的意见，一方面研究打废车轴钢的原因。李云鹏说：“郭班长在咱这儿没少出力，对生产帮助很大……。”李云鹏这一拐弯抹角，引起了郭俊全的反感。他想：“伪满时期咱都是一块受苦的哥儿们，今天你当了支部书记就和我打开官腔了，要批评就批评，直来直去，何必来这一套？”就顺口说：“你别和我来这份‘骚茄子’（别扯这一套的意思）。”郭俊全对大家说他打坏材料不心疼十分闷气，心想“我叫快干是为了生产，倒不如不吱声随大流的好了”，接着说道：“从今以后我啥也不管了，磨房驴听喝……。”
    这件事被工会一个干事知道了。他听了一面之词，没有很好地分析原因，便给工人日报写了一篇稿子。车间支部书记和值班主任抱着“在报纸上批判批判，看他还有啥蹦达”的态度，支持这种做法。工人日报没有深入了解情况，就以“郭俊全的工作态度对不对？”为题，在报纸上展开了批判讨论。这对郭俊全的确是一个沉重的打击。他爱人说：“那阵，老郭像得了魔症一样，整天坐立不安，一句话也不讲。他前脚一动，我后边就跟着他担心，生怕出啥岔子！”
    报纸上的讨论越来越热烈了，各地职工纷纷在这个论坛上发表自己的见解。工人日报最后把这些信一齐寄给了郭俊全。这些信件叠起来足有二尺多厚，可是厂内的工人却没有一个参加讨论的。当报上的讨论快结束时，工人日报曾向锻钢车间支部要郭俊全的检讨，郭俊全憋了一肚子窝囊气，十分冒火地说：“谁是土皇上谁检讨，我不写！”当时的团支部书记一看，工人日报的讨论下不来台了，就代替郭俊全写了一份检讨书，算是交了差。
    这时，郭俊全的副班长职务也被撤掉了。郭俊全觉得是“不明不白地栽了个跟头”。他想：“反正领导叫谁行，谁就行，叫谁糟谁就糟”，长期间感到委屈。
    郭俊全似乎是摸到了领导的规律，果然，叫他“行”的时候来了。1954年厂部对产品质量的要求提高了，而锻钢车间的生产情况很不好，领导上为了突破这一关，便有意识地抓对完成任务有决定意义的成品锤——三号锤，因此郭俊全班又得到了领导的关怀。正如郭俊全说的：“这时领导上真支持，工会生产干部老刘，经常到我家来串门打听生产情况，我们提出的合理化建议也能及时解决。”有了领导的支持，加上郭俊全的技术熟练和全班工友的努力，在4月的一天超额50％完成任务，创造了锻钢的最高纪录，于是曾一度被当作“土皇上”批判的郭俊全，又获得了首创新纪录的荣誉。厂部敲锣打鼓送来了喜报，发下了奖品，还把郭俊全树立为全厂的旗帜，又组织郭俊全到广播电台录音介绍经验。人逢喜事精神爽，郭俊全的心里真像开了一朵花，每天下班和他爱人总是有说有笑的。不久，市妇联又把他爱人张玉珍如何料理家务、帮助郭俊全的事迹登了报。郭俊全见了很高兴，便和爱人开玩笑说：“星星跟着月亮走，我行了，你也受抬举了。”家里充满着愉快的气氛。
    郭俊全班成为先进生产班后，大家干得非常起劲。郭俊全想：“一定要保持住这个荣誉！”可是，他们班在忙于赶生产任务的情况下，逐渐忽视了安全。因此，在10月里的一天，因违反操作规程发生了重大的机械事故——拉杆折断了，接着12月间又折断了一根拉杆。
    这几次事故，是和郭俊全思想上产生了骄傲自满情绪分不开的。可是在这个期间，从车间到厂的党组织，谁都没有对郭俊全班进行过有益的批评教育。事故发生后，也没有人去冷静地分析事故发生的原因，反而马上算起老账来，甚至把他们班在2月间（创新纪录以前）折断的拉杆也算进去，不分青红皂白，就发下了惩处通知书。当厂部奖给郭俊全的闪耀着“首创新纪录”五个大红字的黄色绒衣还没有褪色的时候，郭俊全又被降薪一级了。至于当时车间制造的拉杆没有一定规格，以及因三班循环作业，拉杆已有旧痕等造成事故的客观因素，领导上却并不去考虑，似乎这都和处理事故问题毫不相干。
    今年5月初，发4月份工薪时，郭俊全接到了扣罚工资的通知单，可是其他两班并没被扣罚；而令人莫解的是，4月份竞赛评比的结果，郭俊全班的成绩比其他两班都好。从全工段五项生产竞赛条件（产量、质量、成本、出勤率、节约额）的顺位来看，郭俊全班是十一位；其他两班一个是十二位，一个是十四位。质量指标完成的情况是：郭俊全班完成99％；其他两班一个完成98.5％，一个和郭俊全班相同。这使郭俊全感到不公平，下班后便到质量监督站（下称监督站）去询问原因，监督站长赵韦栋说：“我们只管向车间报废品，不管扣工资。”他又找到了车间，这里更没有人理睬他。郭俊全有理无处申诉，便赌气对干部说：“你们不就是会扣工资吗？扣吧！”郭俊全心里窝火，在生产上就难免不受影响。可巧第二天，一上班打了两根“小尺”（比标准尺码小），并带有伤痕，检查员叫他磨磨“率子”（工具）。郭俊全心想：“你这小毛孩子懂得啥，毛病在哪里，我闭着眼睛也比你清楚。”他认为毛病不在“率子”上，而在开锤工的劲头没找准，便用头示意开锤工劲打小点，根本没理睬检查员的建议。这一点，郭俊全是想错了，打“小尺”虽是开锤工的毛病，而钢材出伤痕确是“率子”勒的。检查员无法，便去报告监督站长，赵站长立刻用电话报告了车间，车间副主任马上叫工长停止了郭俊全的工作。这个事惊动了厂部张副总工程师，他提议：“这个工人个人主义太严重，应该在全厂宣布！”便要兴师动众地当做典型批判批判，后经省委宣传部工作组建议，才没有这样做。
    可是，领导对郭俊全的看法并没有丝毫改变。郭俊全从今年1至5月份连续完不成任务时，曾几次向领导提出困难，并提议不要随便调动技术力量。领导上却认为“郭俊全总叫困难，有劲不肯使。”实际上，三号锤完不成任务和车间管理落后有很大关系，可是领导上并不去考虑这些，反而想出了新“措施”，提拔六级工韩国志（党员）代替郭俊全。他们认为，韩国志政治积极性高，又有组织能力，完全可以带动大家完成任务，这样既可以改变三号锤完不成任务的现状，又可以教育郭俊全，岂不是一箭双雕？于是郭俊全不明不白地被调到了四号锤。郭俊全这时的情绪正像他爱人说的那样：“不知怎的，老郭下班又不爱说话了，打听他厂子的生产情况，高兴了吱一声，不高兴了就是‘去你的吧，你懂得啥！’从这以后我也不问他了。”就这样，郭俊全又被摔了下来。
    事实胜于雄辩，韩国志到了三号锤以后，生产情况并没有丝毫好转；郭俊全调到四号锤以后，由于设备条件较好，一般情况下都能完成生产任务，特别是6月间的一天，有四个工人欠勤，还待料一小时二十五分钟，结果还在保证质量的情况下超额1％完成了任务。由此可见，三号锤的问题，并不在于是郭俊全领导，还是韩国志领导。聪明的领导者，更应该从这个事实当中得出有益的教训，可是锻钢车间的领导干部，直到现在对待郭俊全仍旧没有一个正确的态度，他们不检讨自己在工作上的缺点，而是过多地强调郭俊全的缺点。郭俊全虽然有较严重的骄傲情绪，可是他对个人利益和集体利益的关系，基本上还是明确的，也是愿意把工作做好的，并且一般说来，是有把工作做好的能力的，在政治上也是要求进步的。今年在全国社会主义建设高潮中，郭俊全找到党支部提出入党申请。可是，党支部怎样对待这位老工人的入党要求呢？下面是他和支部组织委员的对话。
      “我要求参加共产党。”
      “你对共产党有什么认识？”
      “我认为共产党是工人阶级的先锋队。”
      “你在早怎么没有想参加？”
      “我怕不够条件，现在提出来试试看。”
      “这叫什么话！试试，——还是没有决心。”
    郭俊全满肚子向往共产党的话说不出来，心里七上八下地走出了支部办公室，而“提出来试试看”也就成了支部委员们闲谈的笑料。至于他们该给郭俊全怎样的帮助，却没有人去考虑。
    郭俊全为什么三起三落？显然，除了他本身有缺点以外，这个厂的党组织是要负严重责任的。
