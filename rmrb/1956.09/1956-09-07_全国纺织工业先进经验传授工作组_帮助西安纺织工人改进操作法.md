Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, September 6th: The National Textile Industry Advanced Experience Transmission Work Group concluded its transmission work in Xi'an and departed for Chongqing on September 3rd to continue transmitting advanced experience.

The work group arrived in Xi'an on August 20th. During their time in Xi'an, they held an advanced operation experience study class. Ninety-five outstanding textile workers from fifteen textile factories in Shaanxi and Shanxi provinces studied in this class and have already returned to their factories to transmit the various advanced experiences they learned to the textile workers.

In the past, most fine yarn workers in cotton textile factories in Shaanxi Province had many yarn breaks when changing roving bobbins due to shortcomings in their operating methods, which affected the quality of the cotton yarn. The "sequential wrapping and joining roving changing method" transmitted by the work group this time can greatly reduce the occurrence of yarn breaks when changing roving bobbins and can improve the uniformity of the cotton yarn. Liu Zhuochen, a fine yarn worker at the state-owned Northwest Second Cotton Textile Factory, had no yarn breaks when changing one hundred roving bobbins after learning this advanced operating method. Hou Xiumin, a weaving worker at the state-owned Northwest Third Cotton Textile Factory, quickly mastered this method in her operation after learning the experience of "arc-shaped three-stage handling and then checking the fabric surface" from advanced producer Wang Shizhen. Zhu Fenxia, a weaving worker at the Shaanxi First Cotton Textile Factory, used to be very slow in handling basic loom stoppages, which made the loom stoppage time very long. After learning the continuous operation method of handling loom stoppages this time, the time she spent handling stoppages was greatly shortened, so she has increased the number of looms she watches from eighteen to twenty-four.

During their stay in Xi'an, the work group also gave lectures and demonstrations on various advanced operating methods to cadres of relevant units in Shaanxi Province and technicians from various textile factories.

    全国纺织工业先进经验传授工作组
    帮助西安纺织工人改进操作法
    新华社西安6日电　全国纺织工业先进经验传授工作组结束了在西安的传授工作，于9月3日动身去重庆继续传授先进经验。
    这个工作组是在8月20日到达西安的。他们在西安期间，举办了一个先进操作经验学习班。陕西和山西两省十五个纺织工厂的九十五名优秀纺织工人在这个学习班学习后，已经分别回厂向纺织工人传授他们学到的各种先进经验。
    陕西省各棉纺织厂过去大多数细纱值车工换粗纱接头时，由于操作方法有缺点，断头很多，影响棉纱的质量。这次工作组传授的“顺续包接换粗纱方法”，可以使换粗纱时的断头现象大大减少，并且可以提高棉纱的均匀度。国营西北第二棉纺织厂细纱值车工刘濯尘，学习这个先进操作方法以后，换了一百个粗纱都没有断头。国营西北第三棉纺织厂织布工人侯秀民，这次向先进生产者王世珍学习“弧形三段着手后检查布面”的经验后，很快就在操作中掌握了这种方法。陕西第一棉纺织厂织布工人朱粉霞，过去处理布机停台基本操作很慢，使布机停台的时间很长，这次她学会了布机处理停台的连续操作方法以后，处理停台时间大大缩短，因而她已由原来看十八台布机提高到看二十四台。
    这个工作组在西安期间，还先后向陕西省有关单位的干部、各纺织厂的技术人员讲解和表演了各项先进的操作方法。
