    New Developments in the Friendship Between the Soviet Union and Indonesia
    In recent years, a gratifying phenomenon has emerged internationally: the increasing number of mutual visits and direct contacts between leaders of various countries. These visits and contacts have strengthened mutual understanding between countries and created a beneficial atmosphere of peace, which has strongly promoted the easing of the international situation. Indonesian President Sukarno's recent visit to the Soviet Union brilliantly demonstrates this.
    President Sukarno's visit was warmly and solemnly welcomed by the Soviet government and people. It signifies that the friendship between the two peoples is constantly developing. The statement issued after the talks between Chairman Voroshilov and President Sukarno pointed out that the two countries will strengthen their cooperation based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. The communiqué specifically mentioned the Soviet Union's provision of long-term loans to Indonesia, which undoubtedly has significant implications for the economic cooperation between the two countries. In terms of international affairs, the two countries declared their joint implementation of the spirit and principles of the Bandung Conference to maintain world peace and support the struggle against colonialism. The Soviet Union and Indonesia reiterated their consistent stance on the current Suez Canal issue, that is, the need to fully respect Egypt's sovereignty and dignity and resolve it peacefully. All of this embodies the many common ideas and aspirations of the nearly 300 million people of the Soviet Union and Indonesia. These common ideas and aspirations enable the Soviet Union and Indonesia to cooperate more extensively and make greater contributions to the cause of world peace and justice.
    Indonesia is an emerging major Asian country. After shaking off the shackles of colonialism, it is advancing along the path of consolidating national independence and developing the national economy. In recent years, the Indonesian people have achieved great successes in political, economic, and cultural construction. At the same time, it has actively pursued a foreign policy of peace and independence, becoming a powerful factor for peace on the international stage. Indonesia stands in solidarity with Asian and African countries, and plays an increasingly important role in the struggle against colonialism and for the independence and freedom of all countries. These contributions made by Indonesia in international affairs are greatly respected by the Soviet people, which brings the hearts of the two peoples closer together.
    The Soviet people have always expressed the greatest concern, sympathy, and support for the struggle of Eastern countries for independence and freedom. The Soviet Union is willing to provide selfless assistance to newly independent Asian and African countries without any political conditions, in order to develop their national economies and consolidate their independence. Therefore, Asian and African countries can always find true allies and friends in the Soviet Union in their struggle for peace and freedom.
    The Chinese people are very pleased to see the development of friendship between the Soviet Union and Indonesia. At the same time, we deeply thank the joint statement of the Soviet Union and Indonesia for its strong support for China's legitimate status in the United Nations. Now, the Chinese people are eagerly looking forward to President Sukarno's visit to China in the near future. We believe that the friendship between China and Indonesia will also achieve new development.

    苏联和印度尼西亚的友谊的新发展
    近年来在国际间出现一种令人喜悦的现象，这就是各国领袖之间的互相访问和直接接触越来越多了。这些访问和接触加强了各国之间的互相了解，并且创造了一种有益的和平气氛，对国际局势的和缓起了有力的促进作用。最近印度尼西亚总统苏加诺到苏联的访问，就更光辉地证明了这一点。
    苏加诺总统的访问，受到苏联政府和人民的热烈和隆重的欢迎。它标志着两国人民的友谊正在不断向前发展。伏罗希洛夫主席和苏加诺总统会谈后发表的声明指出：两国将以和平共处的五项原则为基础，来加强它们之间的合作。公报特别谈到苏联将向印度尼西亚提供长期贷款的问题，这对于两国的经济合作无疑有着重大的意义。在国际事务方面，两国声明共同执行万隆会议的精神和原则，以维护世界和平，并支持反殖民主义的斗争。苏联和印度尼西亚重申了它们对目前苏彝士运河问题的一致主张，即必须充分尊重埃及的主权和尊严，通过和平方式来解决。所有这些都体现了苏联和印度尼西亚两国近三亿人民的许多共同的思想和愿望。这些共同的思想和愿望使苏联和印度尼西亚能够更广泛地合作，并对世界和平事业和正义事业作出更大的贡献。
    印度尼西亚是一个新兴的亚洲大国。它在摆脱了殖民主义枷锁之后，正沿着巩固民族独立和发展国民经济的道路前进。近些年来，印度尼西亚人民在政治、经济和文化建设方面都获得了很大的成就。同时，它积极地执行了和平和独立的外交政策，成为在国际舞台上一个有力的和平因素。印度尼西亚同亚非国家团结一致，在反对殖民主义和争取各国独立自由的斗争中，也起着日益重大的作用。印度尼西亚在国际事务中所作的这些贡献，受到了苏联人民的极大尊重，它使两国人民的心更紧密地连在一起了。
    苏联人民对于东方各国争取独立自由的斗争始终表示最大的关怀、同情和支持。苏联对于新近独立的亚非国家，愿意提供不带任何政治条件的无私援助，以发展它们的民族经济，巩固它们的独立。因此，亚非国家在争取和平和自由的斗争中，总是可以在苏联那里找到真正的同盟者和朋友。
    中国人民非常高兴看到苏联和印度尼西亚友谊的发展。我们同时深深感谢苏联和印度尼西亚两国联合声明对中国在联合国的合法地位的有力支持。现在，中国人民正在殷切地期待着不久将来苏加诺总统到中国的访问，我们相信，中国和印度尼西亚的友谊也将得到新的发展。
