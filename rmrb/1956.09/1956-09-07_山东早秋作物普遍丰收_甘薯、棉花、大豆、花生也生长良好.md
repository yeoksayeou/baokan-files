    Shandong's Early Autumn Crops Generally Achieve a Bumper Harvest; Sweet Potatoes, Cotton, Soybeans, and Peanuts Are Also Growing Well
    This newspaper reports that autumn harvesting has generally begun in various parts of Shandong. According to preliminary estimates from the Provincial Department of Agriculture, if no particularly severe disasters are encountered, the total grain output (including soybeans) for the entire province will reach over 30 billion jin, exceeding the plan by over 200 million jin, an increase of approximately 3.2 billion jin compared to last year, representing a growth of 12%.
    This year, over 37 million mu of early autumn crops (spring corn, sorghum, millet) across the province have generally achieved a bumper harvest. Among these, spring corn is expected to yield 300 jin per mu, sorghum 180 jin, millet 220 jin, and rice 214 jin, generally increasing by 10% to 50% compared to last year. Many areas have also seen the emergence of large-scale, high-yield examples. For example, the Huang Yongfu Cooperative in Ziyang County, with over 900 mu of millet, is estimated to have an average yield of over 1,000 jin per mu; the Jin'ai No. 1 Cooperative in Cangshan County, with 810 mu of corn, has an average yield of 520 jin per mu.
    The late autumn crops, such as summer corn, sweet potatoes, and soybeans, totaling over 68 million mu across the province, are also mostly growing well. Among them, the 28.32 million mu of soybeans, due to ample rainfall and timely planting, have grown large plants and are now laden with pods, promising a harvest unseen in many years. The soybean yields in the Jining and Heze Special Districts, which are major soybean producers, are generally estimated to reach 200 jin per mu, with good yields reaching 400 jin.
    The province's 12.8 million mu of cotton, due to timely early sowing, promotion of dense planting, and the selection of improved varieties, are generally growing well. Each plant typically has over ten fruiting branches and has already set five to six mature bolls. Statistics show that in fifteen counties, including Qidong, Binxian, Boxing, and Gaotang, the 4.13 million mu of cotton fields are categorized as follows: 44% growing well, 30% growing moderately, and 26% growing poorly, with an average yield of 56 jin of ginned cotton per mu. Although some cotton-growing areas suffered from flooding this year, the substantial increase in production in non-disaster areas is expected to allow the province to still meet the plan of 43 jin per mu and a total output of 5.16 million dan of ginned cotton.
    Oil crops (peanuts) are also growing well. The province's 11.5 million mu of peanuts are estimated to meet the plan of 245.4 jin per mu. Among them, the key production area, Laiyang Special District, with 3.5 million mu of peanuts, is expected to reach an average of 301 jin per mu. (Zhu Yanxun)

    山东早秋作物普遍丰收
    甘薯、棉花、大豆、花生也生长良好
    本报讯　目前山东各地普遍开始秋收。根据省农业厅初步估计，如果不再遭受特大灾害，全省粮食（包括大豆）总产量将能达到三百多亿斤，超额完成计划二亿多斤，比去年约增产三十二亿斤，增长12％。
    今年全省三千七百余万亩早秋作物（春玉米、高粱、谷子）普遍获得丰收。其中春玉米预计每亩可产三百斤，高粱产一百八十斤，谷子产二百二十斤，稻谷产二百一十四斤，一般比去年增产一成到五成。不少地区并涌现出许多大面积高额丰产典型。如滋阳县黄永福社九百余亩谷子，估计每亩平均可产一千斤以上；苍山县金爱一社八百一十亩玉米，每亩平均可产五百二十斤。
    全省六千八百余万亩夏玉米、薯类、大豆等晚秋作物，也大部生长良好，其中二千八百三十二万亩大豆，由于雨水充足，播种及时，棵长得大，现已豆荚累累，可获得多年来未有的丰收。盛产大豆的济宁、菏泽两专区的大豆每亩产量，估计一般可达到二百斤，好的能达到四百斤。
    全省一千二百八十万亩棉花，由于适时早播、推行密植以及选用良种等，普遍生长良好。一般每株有十余个果枝，已坐有五—六个老桃。据统计，齐东、滨县、博兴、高唐等十五个县四百一十三万亩棉田，生长好的占全部棉田的44％，生长一般的占30％，生长较差的占26％，每亩平均产量可达到五十六斤皮棉。虽然今年部分棉区遭受涝灾，但由于非灾区大幅增产，估计全省仍能完成亩产四十三斤，总产五百一十六万担皮棉的计划。
    油料作物（花生）生长也很好。全省一千一百五十万亩花生，估计可以完成每亩二百四十五点四斤的计划。其中重点产区——莱阳专区三百五十万亩花生，每亩平均可达到三百零一斤。（朱言训）
