The "Completeness" of "Comprehensive"
Zhao Tian

Everyone agrees that we should look at things comprehensively. Criticism, naturally, should also not be one-sided. If we seize upon one or two minor flaws and make a comprehensive negation, or take things out of context and arbitrarily distort the criticized party's original meaning, that is a harmful trend and should undoubtedly be opposed. However, the "completeness" of "comprehensive" must have a boundary; otherwise, the "comprehensive" requirement for criticism may correct crude criticism, but it may also have the effect of hindering legitimate criticism. For example, if someone only has a sore on their nose, and someone else says that this person is completely bad, that is naturally not in line with the facts and is considered crude criticism. But if someone only criticizes the nose, saying how bad the sore on the nose is, there is no need to talk about the person's whole body; otherwise, in order to talk about the nose, one would have to talk about the eyes, the ears, starting from the hair and going all the way down to the heels—wouldn't that be too verbose? Situations of the same nature exist in academic criticism and in the lives of some of our organizations. For example, if someone has an opinion on a certain point in a specialist's specialized work and wants to offer criticism, someone will ask: Have you conducted a comprehensive study of this specialized discipline like the expert, and do you have comprehensive knowledge? As a result, this person feels ashamed due to a lack of such "comprehensive" knowledge and does not even dare to raise this point of view. As for the lives of some of our organizations, when some people have shortcomings and are criticized, no matter how accurate the criticism is, they always feel wronged, complaining that the critic did not see their good aspects, believing that this criticism is "not comprehensive," is nitpicking, and therefore also believes that the critic's criticism is crude, etc. Everyone will encounter such phenomena, so there's no need to say more.

Therefore, to talk about completeness, we must clearly recognize what kind of face we're talking about. A nose is a nose, and the whole body is the whole body; we cannot lump together things of different sizes. Otherwise, the connections between everything are very broad, small faces are within large faces, and large faces are encompassed by even larger faces, making it difficult to speak. For example, in the example of the sore on the nose mentioned above, if we confuse the "face" of the whole body with the "face" of the nose, it will be very troublesome to describe the small matter of the sore on the nose.

In short, the requirement for "comprehensiveness" must be appropriate; otherwise, it will have the effect of negating criticism.

### “全面”的“面”

    “全面”的“面”
    赵天
    看事物要全面，这是谁都同意的。批评什么，自然也不应该片面。如果抓住一两点小毛病就作了全面的否定，或者断章取义，任意歪曲被批评者的原意，那是歪风，不用说是应该反对的。但是“全面”的“面”必须有一个界限，否则对批评的“全面”要求，或许能纠正粗暴的批评，但同时也可能产生阻挡正当批评的作用。比如说吧，某甲只是鼻子上长了一颗疮，如果某乙说，这个人全身都坏了，自然不合事实，算是粗暴的批评。但是如果某乙只是批评某甲的鼻子，说是这只鼻子上的疮如何不好，就不必要讲到某甲的全身；否则为了讲鼻子，还要讲到眼睛如何，耳朵如何，从头发讲起，直到脚跟，不是太费话了么？在学术批评方面和在我们的有些机关的生活中，和这性质一样的情况，是存在的。例如有一个人对一位专家的某一专门著作中的某一论点有意见，想要提出批评，有人就问道：你对这一专门学科像某专家一样作了全面的研究，具有全面的知识吗？于是这个人便因缺乏这样的“全面”知识，自觉惭愧，连这一点意见也不敢提了。至于在我们的有些机关的生活中，有的人有了缺点，受到批评，不论批评如何准确，总觉得委屈，埋怨批评者为什么没有看到他的好的方面，认为这种批评“不全面”，是抓小辫子，因而也认为批评者的批评是粗暴的等等，这样的现象大家都会碰得见，就不用多说了。
    因此，要说全面，就必须明确认识什么样的面，鼻子就是鼻子，全身就是全身，不能够大小事物混为一谈。否则，万事万物联系很广，大面包小面，大面又被更大的面所包，说话就很难了。比如上面举的鼻子生疮的例子，把全身的“面”和鼻子的“面”混为一谈，要叙述鼻子生疮这一件小事，就十分麻烦的了。
    总而言之，要求“全面”要要求得适当，否则就会产生取消批评的作用。
