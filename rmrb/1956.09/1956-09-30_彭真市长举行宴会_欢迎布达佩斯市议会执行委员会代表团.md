Xinhua News Agency, September 29th—At the invitation of Beijing Mayor Peng Zhen, the delegation of the Budapest City Council Executive Committee of Hungary arrived in Beijing by plane this afternoon to attend the National Day celebrations and visit China. The head of the delegation is Pongracz, Chairman of the Budapest City Council Executive Committee, and members include Besta Laszlo, Vice Chairman of the City Council Executive Committee, Lanzky Gabor, Member, and Szekacs Jozsefna, Secretary of the Budapest City Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party.

Xinhua News Agency, September 29th—Beijing Mayor Peng Zhen hosted a banquet tonight to entertain the delegation of the Budapest City Council Executive Committee of Hungary. Before the banquet, Peng Zhen met with the delegation members.

In his speech at the banquet, Peng Zhen said that although Budapest and Beijing are geographically far apart and we have never met before, we feel very close at first sight. This is because the ideas of Marxism-Leninism and the common cause of socialism connect us very closely.

Pongracz, head of the delegation and Chairman of the Budapest City Council Executive Committee, said in his speech that we have always regarded the Chinese revolution as our own cause and are very concerned about every victory you achieve. The victory of the Chinese revolution and the achievements made in construction have directly strengthened the power of our camp of peace, democracy, and socialism.

Among those present at the banquet tonight were Beijing Vice Mayors Zhang Youyu, Xue Zizheng, Feng Jiping, Jia Tingsan, and Yue Songsheng, Second Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China Liu Ren, Deputy Secretaries Fan Rusheng and Chen Peng, Chairman of the Beijing Federation of Literary and Art Workers Lao She, Secretary-General of the Beijing Municipal People's Committee, directors and chiefs of various bureaus and departments, and heads of various people's organizations.
