Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, September 22nd: The President of the Japan International Trade Promotion Association, Mr. Shōzō Murata, said today that the normalization of diplomatic relations between China and Japan would lead to the rapid development of Sino-Japanese trade.
    At a celebration marking the third anniversary of the founding of the Japan International Trade Promotion Association, Murata said that Japan's trade with China has increased year by year, thanks to the easing of the international situation and the efforts of the Japanese people. However, the current state of Sino-Japanese trade is still unsatisfactory. He said that the most important issues at present are the abolition of embargo restrictions, the conclusion of the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement, and the success of the Japanese commodity exhibitions to be held in Beijing and Shanghai.

    日本国际贸易促进协会会长认为
    恢复中日邦交将使两国贸易迅速发展
    新华社22日讯　东京消息：日本国际贸易促进协会会长村田省藏今天说，中日两国的邦交正常化会使日中贸易迅速发展。
    村田在纪念日本国际贸易促进协会成立三周年庆祝大会上说，日本对中国的贸易一年比一年增加，这是由于国际局势趋向缓和和日本人民努力的结果。但是，现在的日中贸易情况还是不能令人满意的。他说，当前最重要的问题是撤销禁运限制，缔结第四次日中贸易协定，以及使将在北京和上海举行的日本商品展览会获得成功。
