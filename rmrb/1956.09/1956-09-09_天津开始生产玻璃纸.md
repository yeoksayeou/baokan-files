    Tianjin Begins Production of Cellophane
    Cellophane, used for packaging high-end goods and previously reliant on imports, has officially begun production at the Tianjin No. 1 People's Paper Mill on September 1st.
    The transparency, softness, and uniformity of this cellophane meet international standards. Using this cellophane to wrap precision instruments, candies, tobacco, and medicines can provide dust prevention, anti-corrosion, and moisture protection. Currently, the Tianjin No. 1 People's Paper Mill has included the trial production of cellophane in its plan, with a daily production of fifteen kilograms (i.e., one ream). The output will gradually increase in the future, and it is estimated that a total of seventeen tons will be produced by the end of this year.
