    President Sukarno of the Republic of Indonesia is about to visit our country at the invitation of Chairman Mao Zedong, and the Chinese people are welcoming his arrival with boundless enthusiasm.
    President Sukarno is a heroic fighter for the independence and freedom of his motherland. His outstanding role in the creation of the Republic of Indonesia is universally recognized. President Sukarno was born on June 6, 1901, in Surabaya, East Java. Thirteen years of his life were spent in the colonialists' prisons and in exile.
    Sukarno devoted himself to the cause of national liberation early on. In 1920, he graduated from a secondary school in Surabaya. In 1925, he graduated from the Civil Engineering Department of the Bandung Institute of Technology, earning a Bachelor of Engineering degree. He was twenty-four years old at the time. From his secondary school days, he had close contact with many outstanding national revolutionary leaders of the time and participated in a patriotic organization called "Young Java." At that time, he was already writing editorials and articles for some newspapers and giving enthusiastic speeches at mass rallies denouncing the irrational phenomena under colonial rule. In 1926, Sukarno participated in the founding of the Bandung "Study Club," which belonged to the "non-cooperation" faction.
    In 1927, Sukarno and his friends founded the "Indonesian National League," which practiced "non-cooperation" with the Dutch, and served as the first chairman of the "League." The "Indonesian National League" was later renamed the "Indonesian National Party." Later, he also participated in and founded another political organization, the "Union of Indonesian Political Parties," and served as its chairman.
    In 1929, the Dutch colonial authorities arrested Sukarno on the pretext of "preparing to launch a rebellion" and did not release him until 1932. During his trial in the Bandung District Court, Sukarno delivered his famous defense speech, angrily denouncing the Dutch rulers' cruel acts of oppression and exploitation of the Indonesian people, and expressing the Indonesian people's strong will for independence and freedom. These defenses have been translated into Chinese under the title "Indonesia Accuses." We can read them in the "Collection of Sukarno's Speeches."
    After his release from prison, Sukarno joined the "Indonesian Party." This party was formed from a part of the forces of the self-dissolved "Indonesian National Party." At the first party congress, Sukarno was elected chairman of the party.
    In 1933, the Dutch colonial authorities arrested Sukarno again and banned the "Indonesian Party." The colonial authorities first imprisoned him on the remote island of Flores, and later imprisoned him in South Sumatra. It was not until 1942 that Sukarno had the opportunity to be released from prison.
    After his release from prison, Sukarno continued to engage in political activities. In 1945, on the eve of the surrender of the Japanese invaders, eighteen representatives from various regions of Indonesia organized the "Committee for the Preparation of Indonesian Independence," and Sukarno served as the chairman of the committee.
    On August 17, 1945, Sukarno, on behalf of the Indonesian people, declared the independence of the Republic of Indonesia, opening a new page for Indonesia to embark on the road of national independent development. The next day, Sukarno was elected President of the Republic.
    At this time, the remnants of the Japanese invading army in Indonesia were still advancing on the Republic. Soon after, British troops landed in Indonesia in the capacity of Allied forces. Subsequently, the troops of the Dutch colonialists returned, attempting to restore colonial rule in Indonesia. The newly born Republic of Indonesia faced a difficult situation. The Indonesian people launched a heroic struggle to defend the fruits of the anti-fascist struggle.
    Under the attack of the Dutch colonial army, in December 1948, Yogyakarta, the then capital of the Republic, fell. Sukarno and other political leaders were detained by the Dutch army and exiled to Bangka Island. However, with the unprecedented upsurge of the Indonesian people's fighting spirit and the severe condemnation of international public opinion, the situation gradually changed. On July 6, 1949, after Indonesia and the Netherlands reached an agreement, Sukarno returned to Yogyakarta from Bangka amidst the warm welcome of the masses.
    In December 1949, Sukarno became the first President of the Federal Republic of Indonesia. In August 1950, the unified Republic of Indonesia was re-established, and Sukarno served as President.
    In June 1945, Sukarno proposed the five basic principles (the "Pancasila") for the establishment of Indonesia, which are now recorded in the preamble to the Republic's Provisional Constitution passed in August 1945. Their contents are: 1. Belief in God and respect for all religions; 2. National unity; 3. Humanitarianism; 4. Democracy; 5. Social justice.
    Sukarno is a staunch defender of Indonesia's freedom, independence, and unity. As he said in his speech during his visit to the United States in May this year: "Let me assure you of this: our independence is not yet complete, but we cherish what we already have more than anything. This independence is not for sale, and no amount of money can buy a fraction of it." Sukarno has sharply exposed the imperialists' sinister plot to subvert the Republic of Indonesia and called on the people of the whole country to maintain high vigilance. He pointed out that West Irian is still under Dutch colonial control, and the people of the whole country must continue to work hard to recover West Irian.
    Sukarno has repeatedly issued calls, demanding that patriotic political forces of various political tendencies unite to shatter the imperialists' conspiracy to split the Indonesian nation. He supports the slogan "Long live the cooperation of nationalists, religious believers, and Marxists," believing that this is the only correct slogan that conforms to Indonesia's actual conditions.
    Sukarno deeply sympathizes with and supports the anti-colonial struggles of other nations. He declared: "We unhesitatingly give moral support to any nation struggling for independence." In his speech during his visit to the Soviet Union in September this year, he solemnly declared: "We are not only opposed to imperialism and colonialism in Indonesia, but also opposed to imperialism and colonialism all over the world."
    Sukarno has always supported the principle of peaceful coexistence between countries with different systems, opposed war, and advocated friendly cooperation between the peoples of all countries. On September 5 this year, he emphasized in his speech to the citizens of Tashkent, Soviet Union: "Today, the idea of ​​peaceful coexistence has become common throughout the world." "The idea of ​​peaceful coexistence will continue to develop and will be accepted by more and more countries. I ask men and women all over the world to work together and fight for lasting peace." At the Asian-African Conference held in Bandung in April 1955, Sukarno delivered a passionate opening speech entitled "Let the New Asia and the New Africa Be Born!", powerfully expressing the feelings, hopes, and determination of the newborn Asian and African countries. The great success of the Asian-African Conference is inseparable from the efforts of President Sukarno and the Indonesian government.
    Sukarno has always cherished the friendly relations between Indonesia and China. The Soviet-Indonesian joint statement issued during his visit to the Soviet Union specifically pointed out: "Granting the People's Republic of China its legitimate status in the United Nations is not only a matter of course, but also a concrete contribution to the cause of world peace." Now, President Sukarno has come to China for a visit. The Chinese people warmly welcome him, welcome the good friend of the Chinese people, and hope to learn more from him.

    苏加诺总统——印度尼西亚独立和自由事业的杰出领袖
    印度尼西亚共和国总统苏加诺应毛泽东主席的邀请即将访问我国，中国人民正怀着无限的热情迎接他的到来。
    苏加诺总统是争取祖国独立和自由的英勇的战士。他在印度尼西亚共和国的缔造过程中所起的卓越作用，是举世公认的。苏加诺总统1901年6月6日诞生在东爪哇的泗水，在他的一生中，有十三年的光阴是在殖民者的牢狱和流放生涯中度过的。
    苏加诺很早就投身于民族解放的事业。1920年，他从泗水的一个中学里毕业。1925年，他在万隆的工学院的土木工程系毕业，获得了工学士的学位。那时他是二十四岁。从中学的时代起，他就和当时许多杰出的民族革命领袖密切往来，参加了一个名叫“青年爪哇”的爱国组织。当时，他已经在一些报纸上撰写社论和文章，并在群众集会上发表热烈的演说抨击殖民统治下的不合理现象。1926年，苏加诺参加创立了属于“不合作”派别的万隆“读书会”。
    1927年，苏加诺和他的朋友们又创立了对荷兰实行“不合作”的“印度尼西亚国民联盟”，并且担任“联盟”的第一任主席。“印度尼西亚国民联盟”以后改名为“印度尼西亚国民党”。此后，他又参加和创立了另一个政治组织——“印度尼西亚政党联盟”，并且担任过这个组织的主席。
    荷兰殖民当局在1929年以“准备发动叛乱”为口实，逮捕了苏加诺，直到1932年才把他释放。苏加诺在万隆地方法院被审讯时，发表了他的著名的辩护词，愤怒地控诉了荷兰统治者压迫和榨取印度尼西亚人民的残酷行为，表达了印度尼西亚人民要求独立和自由的坚强意志。这些辩护词在“印度尼西亚控诉”的题目下，已经译成中文。我们可以在“苏加诺演讲集”中读到它们。
    苏加诺出狱后，参加了“印度尼西亚党”。这个党是由自行解散了的“印度尼西亚国民党”的一部分力量组成的。在第一次党代表大会上，苏加诺当选为党的主席。
    荷兰殖民当局在1933年又逮捕了苏加诺，并且取缔了“印度尼西亚党”。殖民当局起先把他囚禁在边远的弗罗里斯岛，以后又把他关在南苏门答腊。一直到1942年，苏加诺才获得出狱的机会。
    出狱以后，苏加诺继续从事政治活动。1945年，在日本侵略者投降的前夕，印度尼西亚各个地区的十八名代表组织了“印度尼西亚独立准备委员会”，苏加诺担任了委员会的主席。
    1945年8月17日，苏加诺代表印度尼西亚人民宣布印度尼西亚共和国独立，揭开了印度尼西亚走上民族独立发展道路的新的一页。第二天，苏加诺当选为共和国总统。
    这时，在印度尼西亚残存的日本侵略军还在向共和国进犯。以后不久，英国军队以盟军的身份在印度尼西亚登陆。接着，荷兰殖民者的军队卷土重来，企图恢复在印度尼西亚的殖民统治。新诞生的印度尼西亚共和国面对着困难的局面。印度尼西亚人民为了保卫在反法西斯斗争中取得的果实而展开了英勇的斗争。
    在荷兰殖民军队的进攻下，1948年12月，共和国当时的首都日惹失陷。苏加诺和其他政治领袖被荷军扣留，并且被放逐到邦加岛。可是，在印度尼西亚人民战斗精神的空前高涨和国际舆论的严厉谴责下，局势渐渐转变了过来。1949年7月6日，印度尼西亚与荷兰达成协定后，苏加诺在群众的热烈欢迎下，从邦加回到日惹。
    1949年12月，苏加诺就任印度尼西亚联邦共和国的第一任总统。1950年8月，再度成立统一的印度尼西亚共和国，苏加诺担任总统。
    1945年6月，苏加诺提出了印度尼西亚建国的五项基本原则（即“五基”），这五项基本原则现在已经记录在1945年8月通过的共和国临时宪法的序言上。它们的内容是：一、信奉真主和尊重一切宗教；二、民族统一；三、人道；四、民主；五、社会公平。
    苏加诺是印度尼西亚的自由、独立和统一的坚决的维护者。正如他在今年5月访问美国的演说中所说的：“让我向你们肯定地讲明白这一点：我们的独立还不是完备的，可是我们珍视我们目前已经有的，甚于珍视一切。这种独立并不是要出售的，任何货币也不能买到它的一分一毫。”苏加诺曾经尖锐地揭露帝国主义者要颠复印度尼西亚共和国的罪恶阴谋，号召全国人民保持高度的警惕。他指出西伊里安还在荷兰的殖民主义控制下，全国人民必须为收复西伊里安而继续努力。
    苏加诺曾经屡次发出号召，要求各种不同政治倾向的爱国政治力量团结起来，粉碎帝国主义者企图分裂印度尼西亚民族的阴谋。他支持“民族主义者、宗教信徒和马克思主义者合作万岁”的口号，认为这是符合印度尼西亚实际情况的唯一的正确口号。
    苏加诺深切地同情和支持其他民族的反殖民主义斗争。他宣布：“我们毫不迟疑地在道义上支持任何为独立而斗争的民族。”他在今年9月访问苏联时的演说中庄严宣告：“我们不仅反对在印度尼西亚的帝国主义和殖民主义，而且反对全世界的帝国主义和殖民主义。”
    苏加诺一贯支持不同制度的各国和平共处的原则，反对战争，主张各国人民互相友好合作。今年9月5日，他对苏联塔什干的市民演讲，强调指出：“今天，和平共处的思想已普遍于全世界。”“和平共处的思想将不断地发展，将为愈来愈多的国家所接受。我要求全世界的男女都来为争取持久和平而共同努力和进行斗争。”1955年4月在万隆召开的亚非会议上，苏加诺以“让新亚洲和新非洲诞生吧！”为题，发表了热情磅礴的开幕词，有力地表达了新生的亚非国家的感情、希望和决心。亚非会议的巨大成就是和苏加诺总统和印度尼西亚政府的努力分不开的。
    苏加诺一向珍视印度尼西亚和中国的友好关系。在他访问苏联期间发表的苏联—印度尼西亚联合声明中特别指出：“给予中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法地位，这不仅是理所当然的事情，而且也是对世界和平事业的具体贡献。”现在，苏加诺总统已经来到中国访问。中国人民热烈地欢迎他，欢迎中国人民的好朋友，并且希望从他那里得到更多的教益。（新华社）（附图片）
