Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 8th - Hong Kong News: The Hong Kong Chinese Reform Association, one of the Hong Kong social groups with a large membership, passed a statement on the evening of the 7th, opposing the unreasonable measures of the Hong Kong British authorities to re-implement entry restrictions.

The statement pointed out that Chinese people entering Hong Kong cannot and should not be treated the same as foreign immigrants, because this is a traditional right of the Chinese people.

The statement said, "Just as we are celebrating the basic agreement reached in the negotiations for the Guangzhou-Kowloon through train, which will make Guangzhou-Kowloon traffic more convenient, we did not expect the Hong Kong British authorities to take unilateral action again and restore entry restrictions. This is very regrettable. This measure will put Hong Kong and the mainland in an extremely difficult transportation situation, causing unnecessary pain and economic losses to travelers, and will inevitably affect the development of trade between Guangdong and Hong Kong, causing a blow to Hong Kong commerce."

The statement said: "Some people think that the reason why the Hong Kong British authorities have taken this measure is entirely because of the overpopulation here. We cannot agree with this. On the contrary, we believe that if the restrictions are lifted and the Guangzhou-Kowloon through train is restored, the number of people returning to the mainland to live will be greater than the number of people coming to Hong Kong to live."

The statement demanded that the Hong Kong British authorities revoke this restriction as soon as possible and restore the Guangzhou-Kowloon through train.

    香港华人革新协会通过声明
    要求英国当局撤销限制入境的措施
    新华社广州8日电　香港消息：会员众多的香港社会团体之一、香港华人革新协会7日晚上通过一项声明，反对香港英国当局再度施行入境限制的无理措施。
    声明指出，中国人民进入香港不能也不应与外国移民一律看待，因为这是中国人民的传统权利。
    声明说，当我们正在为广九直通客车的谈判已基本达成协议，广九交通将较便利而庆贺之际，不料香港英国当局又采取片面行动，恢复入境限制办法，这是十分遗憾的。这一办法将使香港和内地的交通陷于极其困难的境地，造成旅行者不必要的痛苦和经济上的损失，同时也必将影响粤港间贸易的发展，使香港商务遭受打击。
    声明说：有人以为香港英国当局之所以有此措施，完全是因为这里人口过剩的原故，我们对此是不能同意的。相反地，我们相信如果撤销限制，广九直通车予以恢复，返回内地居住的人必较来香港居住的人为多。
    声明要求香港英国当局从速撤销这项限制，并恢复广九直通客车。
