Xinhua News Agency, Prague, September 13th: Paris dispatch: The quadrennial World Volleyball Championships, after fourteen days of intense competition, concluded on the 12th. The Czechoslovakian men's team and the Soviet women's team won the men's and women's titles respectively.

    The match between the Czechoslovakian men's team and the Soviet team on the evening of the 12th was a decisive one. In the last match of the previous men's group, the Czech team lost to the Soviet team 0-3 and finished as runner-up. However, in this year's final group, the Czech team had eight wins and no losses in eight matches, while the defending champion Soviet team had seven wins and one loss in eight matches. Therefore, this first encounter between the two teams on the 12th attracted Parisian fans. Before the game even started, 12,000 spectators had filled the stands. In the first set, the Czech team lost 9-15, but it successively won the second and third sets 15-3 and 15-13. Then, the Soviet team won the fourth set 15-9. However, the Czech team then won the fifth set 15-12. The atmosphere during the match was very tense, and the audience applauded the wonderful plays from time to time.

    The Soviet team, having lost this match and previously lost to the Romanian team, was ranked third despite having the same record as the Romanian team, with Romania taking second place.

    In the women's final, the Soviet team also faced the Czechoslovakian team. The Soviet team defeated the Czech team 3-0 (15:13, 15:8, 15:5) and retained the women's championship.

    This was the first time that the Chinese volleyball team participated in the World Volleyball Championships. In the men's competition with twenty-four national teams participating, the Chinese team finished tenth. In the women's competition with seventeen national teams participating, the Chinese team finished sixth. The Chinese men's and women's teams' players were agile, with infinite tactical variations and sharp attacks, winning the audience's admiration. However, their weakness was that their defense was not tight enough.

    The final results and rankings of the men's teams are: Czechoslovakia, Romania, Soviet Union, Poland, Bulgaria, United States, France, Hungary, Yugoslavia, China. Yugoslavia and China had the same record, but Yugoslavia had more points, so they were ranked ninth.

    世界排球锦标赛结束
    捷苏两国分别获得男女冠军
    新华社布拉格13日电　巴黎消息：四年一度的世界排球锦标赛经过了十四天的紧张竞赛以后，已经在12日结束。捷克斯洛伐克男子队和苏联女子队分别获得了男女冠军。
    捷克斯洛伐克男子队12日晚间同苏联队的比赛是具有决定意义的一场。在上届男子组最后一场比赛时，捷队曾经以○比三输给苏联队而居于亚军。但是，在这一届的决赛组中，捷队八战八胜，上届冠军苏联队八战七胜。因此，这两队在12日的第一次交锋吸引住了巴黎的球迷们。在比赛还没有开始以前，一万二千名观众就把看台挤得满满的。第一局，捷队以9比15失败，但是，它接连以15比3和15比13胜了第二、第三局。接着，苏联队又以15比9胜了第四局。但是，捷队又以15比12取得第五局的胜利。比赛期间空气十分紧张，观众不时对精彩的动作报以掌声。
    输了这一场的苏联队由于在以前曾经输给罗马尼亚队，虽然它的成绩同罗马尼亚队一样，但是被列为第三名，由罗队取得亚军。
    在女子组决赛中，苏联队也是对捷克斯洛伐克队。苏联队以3比0（15∶13，15∶8，15∶5）胜捷队，而蝉联女子冠军。
    中国排球队是第一次参加世界排球锦标赛的。在有二十四个国家的男子队参加的比赛中，中国队获得第十名。在有十七个国家女子队参加的比赛中，中国队得第六名。中国男女两队的队员身材灵活，战术变化无穷而且攻势锐利，获得了观众的赞赏。但是，他们的缺点是防守还不够严密。
    决赛结果，男子组各队的名次是：捷克斯洛伐克、罗马尼亚、苏联、波兰、保加利亚、美国、法国、匈牙利、南斯拉夫、中国。其中南斯拉夫和中国两队的成绩一样，但是南队积分较多，所以名列第九。
    女子组各队的名次是：苏联、罗马尼亚、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、保加利亚、中国、朝鲜、民主德国、美国、荷兰。
