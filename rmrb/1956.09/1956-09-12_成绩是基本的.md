    "Achievements are fundamental..."
    Nanshan

    "Achievements are fundamental..." This was originally a good saying, but now some people have ruined it to the point where it has become a self-deceiving phrase, and some even use it as a magic weapon to resist criticism.

    For example, in the recent "salary assessment and grade evaluation," an important task directly related to the people's lives and the socialist distribution principle, the leaders of some units also drafted plans and arranged discussions. But this discussion seemed to be just a facade. There were many obviously unfair and unreasonable aspects in the original plan, and despite repeated opinions from the masses, no revisions were made. As a result, there was an uproar. But despite the "uproar," some leaders simply finished things hastily and made a conclusion with their eyes closed, saying that although there were "shortcomings" in the work, "achievements are fundamental," and so they were complacent and thought everything was fine.

    If you were not satisfied and went to them to offer your opinion, saying that the "achievements" were not necessarily "fundamental," for example, that so-and-so's "morality, talent, and qualifications" were rated too high or too low, and most of the masses were dissatisfied, they would trot out that already overused, specious "great principle" to lecture you, saying things like "it's impossible to do everything perfectly," "we must consider the problem comprehensively," "this is the instruction of the higher authorities!" and so on. However, this is still considered relatively polite. If you are still not convinced and retort a few words, then they will darken their face and say that you are "making personal emotional outbursts" and are "dissatisfied with the leadership." Afterwards, you will inevitably be taken as a "typical example" and "criticized" at a "certain" meeting, making you feel both ridiculous and unable to speak again.

    Speaking of which, people will of course ask: Why do these people do this? To put it bluntly, it's actually very simple! Sitting in the office making phone calls, listening to reports, giving instructions, and holding meetings, using preconceived notions and prejudices to replace facts, is really much easier than going deep into the lower levels, conducting investigations and research, and doing solid work! However, this "ease" is exchanged for damage to the work and the interests of the masses.

    Therefore, I boldly suggest that you take off your airs as soon as possible, go to the masses to listen to more opinions, see more facts, and then specifically analyze whether the achievements are really "fundamental," what errors and problems there are, correct what should be corrected, persuade those who should be persuaded, and of course, criticize what should be criticized. If this is the case, then you are a leader in the true sense of the word; and the real "achievements" of such leaders in their work cannot be denied by anyone.

### “成绩是基本的……”

    “成绩是基本的……”
    南山
    “成绩是基本的……”，这本来是句好话，但现在有些人把它糟蹋得成为一句自欺欺人的话了，甚至还有人拿它作为抵制批评的法宝。
    例如在最近的“评薪评级”这一直接关系到群众生活和社会主义分配原则的重要工作中，某些单位的领导人也拟订方案，布置讨论。但这讨论好像只是块招牌，原订方案中明明白白有许多不公平、不合理的地方，虽经群众一再提出意见，却始终不作修改，于是众口哗然。但尽管“哗然”，某些领导人则自管草草收场，并闭着眼睛作出结论说：工作里虽然也存在着“缺点”，但“成绩是基本的”云云。于是乎自满自足万事大吉。
    假使你不服气，找上门去提意见，说“成绩”不见得“是基本的”，比如某人某人“德才资”如何如何，提得太高或太低，大多数群众不满意，他就会搬出那套早已用滥了的、似是似非的“大道理”来教训你一顿，说什么“要做得十全十美是不可能的”啊，“要全面考虑问题”啊，“这是上级的指示”啊！等等。不过这还是比较客气的，要是你再不服气，回敬他几句，那他就会把脸一沉，说你“闹个人情绪”“不满领导”；过后还不免被当作“典型例子”在“一定”的会议上进行“批判”，直弄得你啼笑皆非、不敢再说而后已。
    说到这里，人们当然要问：这些人为何要这样做呢？说穿了其实也很简单！坐在办公室里打打电话、听听汇报、作作指示、开开会议，用成见和偏见来代替事实，比之深入下层、调查研究，扎扎实实地做点工作，真不知要轻松多少倍！然而，这“轻松”却是用损害工作和群众利益换来的。
    因此，我斗胆建议，趁早放下架子，到群众里去多听听意见，多看看事实，然后再来具体分析成绩是否真是“基本的”，还有什么错误和问题，该纠正的纠正，该说服的说服，该批判的也当然应该批判。果如是，便是名副其实的“领导人”；而这样的领导人在工作中的真“成绩”是谁也抹煞不了的。
