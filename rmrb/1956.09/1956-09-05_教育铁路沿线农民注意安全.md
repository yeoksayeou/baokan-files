    Educate Farmers Along the Railway Line to Pay Attention to Safety
    Recently, several tragic incidents of trains running over pedestrians have occurred within the area managed by the Hengyang Railway Branch Bureau. On June 21st, farmer Liao Chengguo was struck and killed between Matianxu and Gongpingxu while attempting to cross the tracks as Train No. 62 approached. Farmer Xu Chuanxing, while managing water in his paddy fields at night, felt hot and rested his head on the rail to sleep. Although awakened twice by track patrol workers, he secretly continued to rest his head on the rail, and was subsequently run over and killed by Train No. 1415. Incidents of livestock being struck and killed by trains also occur frequently. According to statistics from the Hengyang Railway Branch Bureau, in May and June of this year alone, 12 pedestrians and one head of cattle were killed.
    Locomotive crew members bear some responsibility for these accidents. Some crew members are not vigilant enough during train operation, failing to observe properly or implement observation procedures, thus preventing some avoidable casualties from being avoided. More importantly, residents along the railway line, especially farmers, lack sufficient awareness of traffic safety, often attempting to cross the tracks as trains approach, walking in the center of the tracks, or grazing cattle near the railway, and are struck and killed by trains when they are unable to avoid them in time. The occurrence of such unfortunate events, in addition to causing huge losses to society and families, will also interrupt railway transportation, affect the timely transport of national construction materials, and may even cause major train derailment accidents, the consequences of which cannot be said to be insignificant.
    In order to prevent the above situations from continuing, in addition to the railway department strengthening the education of locomotive crew members to improve vigilance during operation, it is even more important that local governments at all levels strengthen the education of farmers along the railway line, so that they recognize that crossing the tracks is extremely dangerous. Only when all relevant departments care about this matter together and jointly strengthen publicity work can casualties be effectively avoided.　Sun Yong

### 教育铁路沿线农民注意安全

    教育铁路沿线农民注意安全
    最近在衡阳铁路分局所管线路内，发生了数次列车压死行人的惨痛事件。6月21日，农民廖成国在第六十二次列车驶来时抢越轨道，结果在马田圩至公平圩间被撞伤致死。农民徐传兴晚上在管理秧田放水时，感到天热，把头枕在钢轨上睡着了，虽被巡道工人唤醒两次，仍偷偷地枕在钢轨上睡觉，结果被第一千四百十五次列车压死。至于牲畜被列车撞死的事件也经常发生。据衡阳铁路分局统计，在今年5、6月份就压死行人十二人、耕牛一头。
    铁路机车乘务员对这些事故应负一部分责任，有些乘务员在列车运行中警惕性不高，不注意了望或不执行了望制度，因而使有些可以避免的伤亡事故没有得到避免；更重要的是铁路沿线居民，特别是农民，对行车安全认识不足，往往在列车行驶时抢越轨道，或在铁道中心行走，或在铁路附近牧放耕牛，一时躲避不及，被列车压死。这种不幸事件的发生，除了给社会和家庭造成巨大损失外，还会中断铁路运输，影响国家建设物资的及时运送，有时还可能造成列车颠覆的重大事故，后果不可谓不严重。
    为了避免以上情况继续发生，除了铁路部门应加强对机车乘务员的教育，在行驶时提高警惕外，更重要的是，希望各级地方政府加强对铁路沿线农民的教育，使他们认识抢越轨道等是十分危险的。只有各有关部门共同来关心这件事，共同加强宣传工作，才能切实避免伤亡事故。　孙永
