    Farmer Trade Service Departments Established in Beijing, Henan, and Other Places; Trial Implementation of Product Sales on Behalf of Farmers

    (Our Newspaper News) Beijing, Henan, Guangdong, Hebei, Zhejiang, Liaoning and other places have begun to pilot the consignment business of selling products on behalf of farmers. The consignment business institutions in various places are generally established on the basis of the original private firms. Under the leadership of the supply and marketing cooperatives, and in conjunction with the socialist transformation of private firms, farmer trade service departments have been formed. The products sold on consignment by the service departments are mostly products that are not easily sold locally on the same day (market day) or need to be transported and sold to other places.

    Beijing originally had 91 private fruit firms, which, through the socialist transformation of private commerce, formed three wholesale groups and 17 firms. Under the leadership of the Beijing Non-Staple Food Management Office of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives, they specialized in the business of selling fruit on consignment. In the second quarter of this year alone, the Yongdingmen Outer Market, through firms using letters, verbal messages, and sending people to contact, sold a total of more than 7.9 million yuan worth of dried and fresh fruits on behalf of agricultural cooperatives and farmers. In order to promote this work, the Henan Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative informed all supply and marketing cooperatives in the province about the situation of the Nanxiangdian Farmer Service Department in Guangshan County selling products on behalf of farmers. In the first quarter of this year, the total trade volume of Nanxiangdian farmers was 31,100 yuan, of which the consignment volume was 25,900 yuan, accounting for 83% of the total trade volume. The Guangdong Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative has requested that each county select one or two market towns to pilot consignment sales, and areas that have piloted in the past should be restored and improved immediately. For areas that do not yet have the conditions to establish consignment agencies, it has been decided to organize the original private firms to sell on consignment for farmers. Huailai in Hebei, Yuyao in Zhejiang, and Xiuyan in Liaoning have all established or are preparing to establish consignment agencies. (Zhao Zixian)

    北京河南等地设立农民贸易服务部
    试行为农民代销产品
    本报讯　北京、河南、广东、河北、浙江、辽宁等地，已开始试办替农民代销产品的代销业务。各地代销业务机构，一般是在原有私营行栈的基础上建立起来的。在供销合作社的领导下，结合对私营行栈的社会主义改造，组成了农民贸易服务部。服务部代销的产品，多是当地当日（集）不易卖掉的或需要向外地运销的产品。
    北京市原有私营水果行栈业九十一家，通过私营商业的社会主义改造，组成了三个批发小组和十七家行栈，在全国供销合作总社北京市副食品经营处的领导下，专搞代销水果的业务。仅永定门外市场，在今年第二季度通过行栈用写信、带口信、派人联系等方式，替农业社和农民代销的干鲜果总额即达七百九十多万元。河南省供销合作社为了推动这一工作，将光山县南向店农民服务部替农民代销产品的情况，向全省供销社作了通报。今年第一季度南向店农民贸易总额为三万一千一百多元，其中代销额为两万五千九百多元，占总贸易额的83％。广东省供销合作社已要求各县选择一两个集镇试办代销，过去试办过的地区，应即恢复与健全起来。对目前还没有条件设立代销机构的地区，决定组织原有私营行栈替农民代销。河北怀来、浙江余姚、辽宁岫岩等县，也都已经建立或准备建立代销机构。　（赵自先）
