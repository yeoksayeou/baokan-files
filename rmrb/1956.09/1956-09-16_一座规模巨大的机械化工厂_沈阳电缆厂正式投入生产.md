Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, September 13th: The largest rebuilt cable factory in our country—the Shenyang Cable Factory—was officially put into production on the 12th. At 9:00 a.m. on the 12th, after the ribbon-cutting ceremony for the official handover of production, all the machines in the factory quickly started running. Guests who came to congratulate the factory then entered the spacious and bright factory buildings and visited various new machines and the cable manufacturing process in the main workshops.

The cable factory has a total of thirteen main and auxiliary workshops. More than 1,000 new machines were installed in the factory buildings, and through the dense underground wires, various parts, motors, distribution panels, and control panels of each machine in the factory were connected. The construction of such a large-scale mechanized factory was very arduous. With the successive help of dozens of Soviet experts, the builders transformed a dilapidated factory into a modern factory in just three years.

Most of the new machines in the Shenyang Cable Factory were supplied by the Soviet Union, and some were new products just successfully trial-produced by the Soviet Union. A tall, modern pulping machine is almost two stories high. It can automatically coat pulp on 360 kilometers of copper wire per hour. The smallest machine for drilling wire die holes is as small as a fist and is very precise. The small holes drilled in the wire dies are thinner than a hair, and can only be seen clearly with a magnifying glass.

During the trial production stage, the Shenyang Cable Factory has produced more than 4,700 tons of electric wires to supply various parts of the country. This year, they have signed more than 700 order contracts with more than 300 units. After this large-scale cable factory is officially put into production, it will greatly improve the technical level of China's cable manufacturing industry. At the same time, it will produce new varieties that our country has never been able to produce, which will play an important role in the construction of industry and agriculture in our country and the use of electricity for people's lives.

    一座规模巨大的机械化工厂
    沈阳电缆厂正式投入生产
    新华社沈阳13日讯　我国改建的最大的电缆工厂——沈阳电缆厂12日正式投入生产。12日上午九时，在厂里举行正式移交生产的剪彩仪式后，全厂的机器都迅速转动起来。到厂祝贺的来宾们，随即进入宽敞明亮的厂房。在主要车间里参观了各种新式机器和电缆的制造过程。
    电缆厂的主要车间和辅助车间共十三个。厂房内安装上一千多台新式机器，通过密布在地下的电线，在全厂每台机器上的各个部件和电动机、配电盘、操作台连接起来。这样规模巨大的机械化的工厂，建设是非常艰巨的。建设者们在几十位苏联专家相继帮助下，却只用短短三年时间，由一座破旧不堪的工厂改建成为一座现代化的工厂。
    沈阳电缆厂的新式机器大部分是苏联供应的，有些是苏联刚刚试制成功的新产品。一台高大的现代化的纸浆机差不多有两层楼高。它每小时可在三百六十公里长的铜线上自动涂上纸浆。最小的一台钻线模眼的小机器，小得像个拳头，而且十分精密。它所钻的线模小眼，比头发丝还细，用放大镜才能瞧得清楚。
    沈阳电缆厂在试生产阶段已经生产出四千七百多吨电线供应全国各地。今年他们和三百多个单位签订了七百多份订货合同。这座规模巨大的电缆厂正式投入生产后，将使我国电缆制造工业的技术水平大大提高。同时，它将生产我国从来不能生产的新品种，对我国工业、农业的建设和人民生活用电都将起重要作用。
