Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 11th. While enthusiastically building the motherland, young people also request that the motherland further care for and nurture them. This was the most interesting topic and demand of young people from all ethnic groups at the first Congress of Guangxi Province Youth Representatives, which concluded on the 9th.

The four million young people of Han, Zhuang, Miao, Yao and more than ten other ethnic groups in Guangxi Province are uniting to actively build Guangxi Province. In the past year alone, rural youth have organized nearly eight thousand fertilizer accumulation shock teams to deliver nutrients to fields undergoing large-scale single-crop to double-crop transformations. Forty thousand young people have built more than five thousand water conservancy projects, eliminating the threat of drought to crops in many arid mountain areas and terraced fields. While taking the lead in agricultural technology reform, the vast majority of youth production teams have achieved bumper harvests. During this year's summer harvest, the harvest volume of 115 youth production teams in Yulin County increased by an average of 27% compared to last year. Young people planted half of the saplings on the land in this year's completed afforestation area in the province. In more than two thousand large and small factories and mines throughout the province, young workers are launching a labor competition of "more, faster, better, and more economical." 1.5 million minority youth are working in their mountainous hometowns for ethnic unity and the early realization of modernized agricultural production. Most of the overseas Chinese youth who have returned from abroad are burying themselves in their studies to master rich cultural and scientific knowledge.

However, young people still face many difficulties in their work, study, and life. The vast numbers of rural and urban youth hope that agricultural cooperatives and institutions can give them a certain amount of time off work to ensure their advance towards culture and science. They also need relevant departments to provide them with sufficient books for reference and learning materials. Young people in the industrial and commercial sectors demand more opportunities for political study. Minority youth hope to carry out various activities according to their customs and lively characteristics, and not to rigidly copy the working methods of the Han areas to organize them. Young people in heavy industry factories and mines hope to have rich and colorful recreational activities to replace the bland and lonely Sunday life, and also hope to pay attention to their marriage problems. Youth representatives from deep mountains and pastoral areas hope to have a wide range of pen pals, and they need to know how young people in cities, plains, and coastal areas live. Some young primary and secondary school teachers request that the relevant parties pay attention to their rest conditions in order to maintain their health.

At this Youth Congress, the Guangxi Provincial Democratic Youth Federation was officially established. The chairman and members of the Federation stated that they would immediately study the demands raised by the youth of all ethnic groups at the meeting in order to better care for them.

    据新华社南宁11日讯　青年们在热情地建设祖国的同时，也要求祖国进一步关怀和培育他们。这是9日结束的广西省青年首届代表大会上，各族各界青年最感兴趣的议题和要求。
    广西省四百万汉、僮、苗、瑶等十多个民族的青年，正在团结一起积极建设着广西省。在最近一年内，农村青年就组织了近八千个积肥突击组，为大规模一造变两造的田地输送养料。四十万名小伙子，兴修了五千多处水利，使许多干旱的山区和梯田上的庄稼，消除旱灾威胁。在带头作农业技术改革的同时，绝大部分青年生产队获得丰收。今年夏收时。玉林县一百十五个青年生产队的收获量，平均比去年增产27％。在今年全省完成的造林面积中，有一半土地上的幼树，是由青年们栽种的。全省二千多个大小型工厂、矿山中，青年工人们正在展开“又多、又快、又好、又省”的劳动竞赛。一百五十万少数民族青年正在多山的家乡，为民族团结和早日实现现代化的农业生产努力着。从国外归来的华侨青年，大多在学校里埋头苦学，以掌握丰富的文化科学知识。
    然而，青年们在工作、学习和生活上也还存在许多困难。广大的农村和城市青年，希望农业社和机关能给他们一定工余时间，保证他们向文化科学进军。他们并且需要有关部门能供应他们充足的书本作参考和学习材料。工商界青年要求得到较多的政治学习机会。少数民族青年，希望能按照他们的风习和活跃的特性，展开各种活动，不要死搬汉族地区的工作方法来组织他们。重工业工厂和矿山里的青年希望有丰富多采的文娱活动来代替平淡寂寞的周日生活，还希望能关心他们的婚姻问题。来自深山和牧区的青年代表希望有广泛的通信朋友，他们需要知道在城市、平原、沿海的青年人是怎样生活着。部分年轻的中小学教师们，要求有关方面能注意他们的休息状况，以维护他们的健康。
    在这次青年代表大会上，广西省民主青年联合会宣告正式成立。联合会的主席和委员们表示要立即研究会上各族青年提出的要求，以便更好地关怀他们。
