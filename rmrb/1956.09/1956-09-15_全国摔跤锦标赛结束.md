    National Wrestling Championships Conclude
    (Our newspaper reports) The 1956 National Wrestling Championships concluded on the afternoon of the 14th at Beihai Stadium in the capital.

    The final match between Yang Ziming of Tianjin, who had won nine matches out of nine, and Zhang Fengcai of Liaoning Province, was particularly noteworthy. As soon as the match began, Yang Ziming attacked fiercely, quickly hooking his right foot around the opponent's calf, and taking the opportunity to twist the opponent's upper body with both hands. With a "crack" sound, the opponent fell. At this moment, a storm of applause and shouts resounded around the stadium. As the opponent had not yet found an effective defensive method, Yang Ziming scored three points in a row. The second round entered a stalemate. In the third round, Zhang Fengcai launched a counterattack, attempting to push the opponent down with his hands, but Yang Ziming followed the momentum, pulling with his hand, causing Zhang Fengcai to lose his balance, stumble, and fall again. Then another one, Zhang Fengcai lost two more points. The match continued, and Zhang Fengcai used a quick waist-abdominal throw, trying to throw the opponent down, but was pressed to the ground by Yang Ziming. In the end, Yang Ziming won 6-0. With this victory, Yang Ziming has now won ten matches out of ten, and won the light heavyweight title.

    The competitions for the featherweight and lightweight titles were also very eye-catching. Finally, the conference announced the list of champions for each weight class: Featherweight: Song Baosheng (Shanghai); Lightweight: Qimude (Inner Mongolia); Middleweight: Ma Qingzong (Shandong Province); Light Heavyweight: Yang Ziming (Tianjin); Heavyweight: Sengge (Inner Mongolia).

    全国摔跤锦标赛结束
    本报讯　1956年全国摔跤锦标赛，14日下午在首都北海体育场结束。
    曾经九战九胜的天津市杨子明和辽宁省张凤才的最后一场比赛，特别引人注意。比赛一开始，杨子明就猛烈进攻，用右脚迅速地钩住对方的小腿，双手趁机将对方上身一扭，“叭啦”一声，对方就倒下去了。这时四周响起了暴风雨般的掌声和喊叫声。由于对方还没有找到有效的防守方法，杨子明一连得了三分。第二局进入相持阶段。第三局张凤才进行反攻，他企图用手推倒对方，但是杨子明顺着手势，用手一拉，张凤才重心维持不住，打了一个跟斗，又倒下去了。接着又是一个，张凤才连失两分。比赛继续进行，张凤才使用快速的腰腹摔，想把对方摔倒，可是又被杨子明用力按在地上。最后，杨子明以6∶0取胜。至此杨子明已经是十战十胜，荣获次重量级冠军。
    次轻量级和轻量级的争夺赛，都很引人注目。最后，大会宣布了各级的冠军名单：次轻量级：宋保生（上海）；轻量级：其木德（内蒙古）；中量级：马清宗（山东省）；次重量级：杨子明（天津）；重量级：僧格（内蒙古）。
