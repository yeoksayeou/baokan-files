Xinhua News Agency, September 28th: The two-day summit between the heads of the British and French governments concluded on September 27th. The communiqué issued after the meeting emphasized that Britain and France should maintain "unity" and act in concert on the Suez Canal issue. A French official spokesman, in explaining the meeting communiqué, stated that Britain and France would continue to insist on the "international control" canal plan that infringes upon Egyptian sovereignty and would not abandon the policy of military intimidation.

According to Agence France-Presse, quoting authoritative sources, the common attitude determined by Britain and France after submitting the Suez issue to the United Nations is to secure the broadest possible support for the principle of "international control" of the Suez Canal.

The French Foreign Ministry spokesman also emphasized that Britain and France both believe that the joint military measures they have taken cannot be changed, and this also applies to the presence of French troops in Cyprus.

According to United Press International, Britain and France also studied the issue of "joint action" in the entire Mediterranean region during the talks. Britain is also trying to persuade France to join the Baghdad Pact.

In addition, British Prime Minister Eden and Foreign Secretary Lloyd returned to London by plane on the evening of the 27th after meeting with French Prime Minister Mollet and Foreign Minister Pineau in Paris.
