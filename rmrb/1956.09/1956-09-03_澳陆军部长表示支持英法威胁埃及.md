Xinhua News Agency, Sydney, 2nd dispatch: Australian Army Minister Cramer supported the British and French military intimidation against Egypt on September 1, saying that if troops were to be used on the Suez issue, an Australian, fully equipped battalion was ready.

The Army Minister said: Another battalion could also be mobilized within a very short time after receiving notification, and if necessary, an entire division of 17,000 men could also be mobilized.

He said that the first battalion would include the core organization of Korean War veterans.

He also said that whether Australia would be asked to send troops if war broke out over the canal issue was still an open question.

    澳陆军部长表示支持英法威胁埃及
    新华社2日讯　悉尼消息：澳大利亚陆军部长克雷默9月1日支持英法对埃及的军事恫吓说，如果在苏彝士问题上要使用部队的话，澳大利亚的一个装备齐全的营已经准备好了。
    这个陆军部长说：另一个营也能够在接到通知以后在一个很短时间内动员起来，如果有必要的话，一个有一万七千人的整个师也可以动员起来。
    他说，第一个营里将包括朝鲜战争的老兵的核心组织。
    他又说，如果在运河问题上爆发了战争，是否会要求澳大利亚出兵，也还是一个未决的问题。
