Xinhua News Agency, 1st. September: Notification from the China Organizing Committee for the 16th Olympic Games inviting athletes from Taiwan Province to participate in the national selection trials. The full text is as follows:

To the Sports Organizations and Athletes of Taiwan Province:

The eagerly anticipated 16th Olympic Games will be held in Melbourne, Australia, from November 22nd to December 8th this year. Athletes across China express their utmost interest and concern.

The Chinese Olympic Committee (All-China Sports Federation) has decided to send a team to participate in the athletic, gymnastics, swimming, weightlifting, shooting, basketball, and football events of this Olympic Games. To achieve certain results in the Olympics, sports circles and athletes across the country are sparing no effort in intensifying preparations, and the people of the whole country are giving us their most active support. Our football team has already secured the right to participate in the Olympic finals, our weightlifters have already created the world record for the lightest weight class in the clean and jerk with both hands, and many of our track and field, swimming, weightlifting, and shooting athletes have also achieved or approached world-class levels.

However, to our regret, the sports organizations and athletes of our Taiwan Province have not yet participated in this work. On the other hand, some people are attempting to create a "two Chinas" conspiracy in the 16th Olympic Games, artificially undermining the unity of Chinese athletes. This situation is not in line with the wishes and interests of all Chinese people, including the people of Taiwan.

The Chinese Olympic Committee believes that Taiwan athletes, like athletes from all provinces and cities in the country, have the right to participate in international sports activities; but our China should only have one representative team, so Taiwan athletes should participate in the unified sports delegation of the People's Republic of China. In recent years, due to various difficulties, we have not been able to contact Taiwan's sports organizations and athletes; but in the face of the upcoming 16th Olympic Games, we should start to solve this problem. Therefore, the China Organizing Committee for the 16th Olympic Games formally notifies Taiwan's sports organizations and athletes: You are welcome to come and participate in the national selection trials for the aforementioned seven events in October this year, and please send representatives to Beijing in September to discuss the specific arrangements for participating in the national selection trials. We have obtained the government's guarantee that you can come and go completely freely, and we will provide you with all kinds of convenience and assistance.

Although we also know that you will encounter many difficulties in returning to participate in the national selection trials. However, whenever we recall the scene of Taiwan, which had just been liberated from Japanese imperialism in 1948, sending more than a hundred sports teams to Shanghai to participate in the 7th National Games, we firmly believe that Taiwan's sports community and athletes have the courage and means to break through the current barriers, stand under the banner of patriotism for the unity of the motherland's sports cause and the glory of the motherland, respond to this call, and work together to represent our prosperous and strong new China in the 16th Olympic Games.

    中国参加第十六届奥运会筹委会
    邀请台湾省运动员参加全国选拔赛
    新华社1日讯　中国参加第十六届奥林匹克运动会筹备委员会为邀请台湾省运动员参加全国选拔赛的通知书。全文如下：台湾省的体育组织和运动员们：
    举世向往的第十六届奥林匹克运动会将在今年11月22日到12月8日在澳大利亚的墨尔本举行，全中国的运动员对它表示最大的兴趣和关怀。
    中国奥林匹克委员会（中华全国体育总会）已经决定选派一支队伍参加这一届奥运会的田径、体操、游泳、举重、射击、篮球和足球等项目的比赛。为了在奥运会上取得一定的成绩，全国体育界和运动员都尽一切力量在加紧准备着，全国人民也对我们给予了最积极的支持。我们的足球队已经取得了参加奥运会决赛的权利，我们的举重运动员已经创造了最轻量级双手挺举的世界纪录，我们的田径、游泳、举重和射击运动员中，也有许多人的成绩达到或接近了世界水平。
    但是，使我们感到遗憾的是，直到如今我们台湾省的体育组织和运动员还没有参加到这一工作里来。而另一方面，却有一些人企图在第十六届奥林匹克运动会中制造“两个中国”的阴谋，人为地破坏中国运动员的统一。这种情形是不符合全中国人民包括台湾人民在内的愿望和利益的。
    中国奥林匹克委员会认为台湾运动员和全国各省市运动员一样，有参加国际体育活动的权利；但我们中国只应该有一个代表队，所以台湾的运动员应当参加到统一的中华人民共和国的体育代表队里来。几年来，由于种种困难，我们没有能够和台湾的体育组织和运动员取得联系；但面对着即将举行的第十六届奥林匹克运动会，我们应该来着手解决这一问题了。因此，中国奥林匹克委员会参加第十六届奥林匹克运动会筹备委员会正式通知台湾的体育组织和运动员：欢迎你们在今年10月间前来参加前述七个项目的全国选拔赛，并请你们派代表于9月份来北京商谈参加全国选拔赛的具体办法。我们已经取得政府的保证，你们来去可以完全自由，并将给予你们以各种方便和协助。
    虽然，我们也知道你们要回来参加全国选拔比赛会遇到许多困难。但每当我们想起1948年刚从日本帝国主义统治下解放出来的台湾，就曾派出一百多名的体育队前来上海参加第七届全国运动会的情景时，我们深信台湾体育界和运动员完全有勇气和办法冲破目前的藩篱，站在爱国主义的旗帜下为祖国体育事业的统一和祖国的光荣而响应这一号召，并为代表我们繁荣富强的新中国参加十六届奥林匹克运动会而一致努力。
