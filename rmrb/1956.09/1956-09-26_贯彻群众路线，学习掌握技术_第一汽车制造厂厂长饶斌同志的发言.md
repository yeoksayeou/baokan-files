    I fully support Chairman Mao's opening address and the reports made by Comrades Liu Shaoqi, Deng Xiaoping, and Zhou Enlai on behalf of the Party Central Committee.

    The Party Central Committee's directive to "Strive to complete the construction of the First Automobile Factory in three years" greatly encouraged all the workers and staff involved in the construction. Under the correct leadership of the higher-level Party and government, thanks to the strong support of the people nationwide, the cooperation of various brother factories, and the selfless and comprehensive assistance of the Soviet Union, and relying on the arduous efforts of all the workers and staff, our factory was able to successfully complete the construction task within three years. We also completed the production preparation work ahead of schedule and trial-produced the domestically-made Jiefang (Liberation) brand automobile of qualified quality.

    Our factory was built with advanced, modern technology and equipment with the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union. The technological processes adopted are also the latest achievements in Soviet automobile production. However, our strength in mastering technology is very weak: old technical cadres at the engineer level account for about 5 percent of the total number of technical cadres, the rest are students who have just graduated from universities, specialized schools, and secondary technical schools; old skilled workers account for about 25 percent of the total number of workers, the rest are newly trained young workers; in addition, more than 500 workers and cadres have been sent to the Soviet Union for study and have returned to the factory. Generally speaking, they lack experience in modern automobile manufacturing and organizing mass production. It can be seen that the technical and management levels of our factory's workers and staff are far from meeting the production requirements of a modern automobile manufacturing enterprise. This is the main contradiction within the factory that was revealed when it was officially put into production after its completion. Now I will talk about some opinions on learning and mastering technology to overcome the above-mentioned contradiction.

    In order to solve the above-mentioned contradiction, in accordance with the mass line policy stipulated by the Central Committee, we launched and organized a mass upsurge of learning and mastering technology in the practice of construction and production preparation, and implemented the mass line of learning technology, laying a preliminary foundation for the rapid and comprehensive improvement of the technical and management levels of our factory. Specifically, we have taken the following measures:

    I. Organize mass mutual teaching and learning, learning while producing, to accelerate the speed of learning and mastering technology. Although the technical strength of our entire factory cannot yet meet the needs of production, it has the good conditions for developing technical strength through mass mutual teaching and learning. In addition to assigning special personnel to learn from Soviet experts, we organize returned interns to impart what they know and test what they have learned in combination with the needs of production and management. Among technical cadres, we promoted the chain-teaching method, in which technical cadres systematically impart their strengths to others in production practice. Among skilled workers, we organized the upgrading and learning of apprenticeships, combining the economic interests of workers' upgrading with the interests of national production needs. According to experience, if there are capable masters and the prescribed training methods are followed, the speed at which skilled workers improve their skills in the mass upgrading learning is: only three months of learning are required for a third-grade worker to be promoted to a higher grade; only four months of learning are required for a fourth-grade worker to be promoted to a higher grade; and only about half a year of learning are required for a fifth-grade worker to be promoted to a higher grade. As for how long it will take for sixth and seventh-grade workers to be promoted to a higher grade, we are still experimenting, and it is estimated to be about one year. Through upgrading learning in production, to date, 2,000 people in the factory have improved their technical grades. At this rate, it is expected that the average grade of workers can be improved by three grades within two years, which can not only ensure that our factory's production reaches the designed capacity, but also provide technical strength to brother factories.

    II. Give play to the creativity of the masses, summarize and promote the advanced experience of the masses in learning technology, and comprehensively improve the technical level. The advanced producer movement in our factory takes "learning technology and improving efficiency" as one of its prominent goals. The methods of learning and mastering technology created by the working masses are very rich. Under the influence of Comrade Hu Nianrong's pioneering spirit of creating deep-hole boring tools and increasing efficiency by 36 times, a large number of advanced producers who have mastered new technologies have emerged. This year, we have adopted more than 7,000 rationalization proposals and summarized and promoted 288 advanced experiences in the factory. For example, the youth shock worker Liu Yaozong's innovation of "no accidents in adjusting hundreds of machines," and the female worker Dong Guiqing's creation of using a graduated dial to increase gear grinding efficiency by 10 times, etc. This has greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of all workers and staff in the factory to learn and master technology. Even workers who are not usually active in learning reflect: "The previous process pulls me, and the next process pushes me. Pulling and pushing has also improved my skills." This is the main factor why 50% of the skilled workers in our factory can reach and exceed the Soviet-designed labor quota in a relatively short period of time.

    III. The combination of labor and technology and the painstaking study of technology, and the establishment of close friendly relations of labor-technology cooperation, have a great effect on the growth of technical strength. Technical cadres and skilled workers in our factory deeply feel that their knowledge and experience are insufficient in the face of new technologies and new equipment. Therefore, "the combination of labor and technology, painstaking study" has become the common requirement of technical cadres and skilled workers in learning technology. Moreover, because the technical cadres and skilled workers who have been transferred to the new factory from all directions do not understand each other, this cooperation not only gives full play to the role of technical cadres in guiding skilled workers to master and improve technology, but also strengthens the mass viewpoint of technical cadres and the style of linking with the masses and linking with reality, and correctly establishes the friendly relationship of labor-technology cooperation. There are many examples of this. For example, the gear section of the chassis workshop has nine American-style "Gleason" bevel gear machines. This kind of precision machine tool is known for being difficult to use and adjust, and there are no experts to guide its use. In order to master this machine, we organized a research team, including two college students and a group of skilled workers, under the leadership of an engineer. After more than two years of joint study, painstaking research, and careful trial production, we finally skillfully mastered this machine. The technical level of both technical cadres and workers has been improved, and a close friendly relationship of labor-technology cooperation has been established. Technical cadres from intellectual backgrounds reflected: "This is a practical and effective way to improve and transform technical cadres."

    IV. Give play to and rely on the creativity of the masses, proceed from reality, and conscientiously implement the process. In our work of learning and mastering technology, we should pay special attention to and earnestly learn from the rich process experience and technical crystallization of the Soviet automobile industry over the years. When adjusting production, our factory mobilized and organized all technical cadres and workers to earnestly study the Soviet-designed process data. Therefore, it strengthened the process concept of workers and staff, and provided conditions for correctly implementing the process, improving technology, and producing qualified products. However, in the work of implementing the Soviet-designed process, it must be emphasized that we must proceed from specific conditions and continuously absorb the creations of the masses in order to do a good job in production. For example, the casting workshop of our factory, because the raw materials used did not meet the original design requirements, therefore, the workshop mobilized and organized workers and staff to explore a process suitable for the new conditions in production practice, which played its due role in ensuring product quality and learning technology. That unscientific attitude of mechanically copying without considering the specific conditions, and the bureaucratic attitude of not paying attention to absorbing the creations of the masses, are harmful.

    V. Exercising and improving in production practice must be combined with systematic and regular cultural and technical learning in order to consolidate the mass upsurge of learning technology for a long time. In terms of systematic spare-time education, we have implemented the policy of "establishing a variety of regular spare-time cultural and technical learning organizations according to the different needs of different people and different jobs." In total, more than 11,000 workers and staff in our factory have participated in night universities, secondary technical schools, technical schools, professional classes, and various learning organizations; many of them have persisted in learning for more than two years, and their learning enthusiasm is very high, and they have achieved great results. Persisting in such learning, we expect that within four or five years, we can train 300 engineers with production and technical experience who have graduated from night universities, and can train 800 to 1,000 technicians from worker backgrounds who have graduated from secondary technical schools; and enable the vast majority of transferred leading cadres who are engaged in management work to be familiar with their own business and reach the level of graduating from secondary technical schools.

    In short, because we have paid attention to implementing the mass line in learning and mastering technology, and have strived to learn from the Soviet Union and from Soviet experts, we have been able to trial-produce the first batch of automobiles ahead of schedule, and have begun to be able to fully put into production at a slow speed of producing seven automobiles per day.

    However, there are still many problems in our factory, and there are still serious shortcomings and errors in our work. From the current situation, many problems that occur in production and process currently cannot be solved independently without Soviet experts. The quality of products in the heat treatment and casting workshops and the quality of engines are very unstable; the quality of maintenance of electromechanical equipment and the manufacture of complex tools has not been mastered well; production efficiency is very low; management order is not good; and the scrap rate is high. This series of shortcomings shows that our technical level and management level are far from keeping up with the needs of production, and we must continue to mobilize the masses to work hard to learn technology and quickly strengthen the management of enterprises in order to seek solutions. From the perspective of future tasks, we must also strive to fully achieve the designed capacity in two or three years, and improve automobile design; we must also strive to create newer and more perfect models and processes that are more suitable for China in four or five years, and strive to catch up with the constantly advancing technical level of the world automobile industry. All these are extremely arduous and glorious tasks. We must mobilize and rely on all workers and staff in the factory to ensure the conscientious implementation of the Eighth National Congress resolutions, actively learn from Soviet experts, and complete our factory's first five-year plan ahead of schedule and overfulfill the target, and reach the designed capacity ahead of schedule. Only by long-term diligent and conscientious efforts in learning; further implementing the mass line in learning and mastering technology; striving to correct shortcomings and errors; always remaining modest and prudent; and better implementing the collective leadership of the Party committee and the individual responsibility system, can we guarantee the completion of all the glorious tasks entrusted by the Eighth National Congress.

### 贯彻群众路线，学习掌握技术  第一汽车制造厂厂长饶斌同志的发言

    贯彻群众路线，学习掌握技术
    第一汽车制造厂厂长饶斌同志的发言
    我完全拥护毛主席的开幕词和刘少奇同志、邓小平同志、周恩来同志代表党中央委员会所作的报告。
    党中央关于“力争三年完成第一汽车厂建厂任务”的指示，大大地鼓舞了建厂的全体职工，我们在上级党政的正确领导下，由于全国人民的有力支援，各兄弟厂的协作配合，以及苏联无私的全面援助，并依靠全体职工的艰苦努力，使我厂能在三年的时间内胜利地完成了建厂任务，并提前完成了生产准备工作，试制出质量合格的国产解放牌汽车。
    我厂是在苏联无私的援助下，用先进的、现代化的技术装备起来的；所采用的工艺过程，也是苏联汽车生产中的最新成就。但是我厂掌握技术的力量却是很弱的：工程师级的老技术干部约占技术干部总数的百分之五，其余都是刚从大学、专科学校和中等技术学校毕业的学生；老技工约占工人总数的百分之二十五，其余都是新近培养训练的青年工人；另派往苏联学习回厂的工人与干部有五百多人。一般说来，他们都没有进行现代化汽车制造和组织大量生产的经验，这就可以看出，我厂职工的技术水平与管理水平，远不能适应现代化汽车制造企业的生产要求的严重情况。这也就是我厂建成后，正式投入生产时所显露出来的厂内的主要矛盾。我现在就学习掌握技术克服上述的矛盾，讲些意见。
    我们为了解决上述矛盾，按照中央所规定的群众路线的方针，在建厂与生产准备的实践中，发动与组织了群众性学习、掌握技术的热潮，贯彻实行学习技术的群众路线，为我厂迅速而全面地提高技术水平、管理水平打下初步基础。具体说来，我们采取了以下的措施：
    一、组织群众性的互教互学，边生产边学习，加快了学习、掌握技术的速度。我们全厂的技术力量，虽还不能适应生产需要，但已具备了用群众互教互学办法，生长技术力量的良好条件。我们除了配备专人向苏联专家学习外，组织回国实习生，结合生产与管理上的需要，传授自己所知，考验自己所学。在技术干部中，我们推行了连锁传授法，技术干部将自己所长，有计划地在生产实践中传授给别人。在技工里，组织师傅带徒弟的晋级学习，把工人晋级的经济利益与国家生产需要的利益结合起来。根据经验，如配有得力师傅，按照规定的培养办法，在实行群众性的晋级学习中，技工提高技术的速度是：三级工晋一级只需学习三个月；四级工晋一级只需学习四个月；五级工晋一级也只需学习半年左右。至于六级七级工提升一级需要学习多久，我们还在试验中，估计约一年左右。经过在生产中的晋级学习，到目前为止，全厂已有二千人提高了技术等级。按照这样的速度，预计在二年内，工人等级平均可提高三级，既能保证我厂生产达到设计能力的需要，又可向兄弟厂输送技术力量。
    二、发挥群众的创造性，总结、推广群众中学习技术的先进经验，全面提高技术水平。我厂的先进生产者运动，是以“学习技术、提高效率”为突出的目标之一。工人群众中创造出来的学习掌握技术的方法是很丰富的。在胡年荣同志创造深孔镗刀、提高效率三十六倍的首创精神影响下，涌现出大批掌握新技术的先进生产者。我们今年已采纳了七千多件合理化建议，并在全厂总结与推广了二百八十八项先进经验，例如：青年突击手刘耀宗“百台次调整不出事故”的创举，女工董桂清使用刻度盘、提高磨齿轮效率十倍的创造等。这就大大鼓舞了全厂职工学习与掌握技术的积极性，连平日学习不积极的工人也反映：“上工序拉着我，下工序推着我，拉拉推推也提高了技术”。这就是我厂在较短的时间内，有百分之五十的技工，能达到并超过了苏联设计的劳动定额的主要因素。
    三、实行劳技结合，刻苦钻研技术，建立劳技合作的亲密友谊关系，对生长技术力量，作用很大。我厂技术干部和技工，在新技术新设备面前都深感知识与经验不足。因此“劳技结合、刻苦钻研”就成为技术干部和技工在学习技术上的共同要求。又由于从四面八方调集到新厂来的技术干部和技工，都互不了解，在这种合作中，不仅充分发挥了技术干部在指导技工掌握与提高技术的作用，同时也加强了技术干部的群众观点与联系群众、联系实际的作风，正确地建立起劳技合作的友谊关系。这一方面的事例是很多的。比如底盘车间齿轮工部有九台美式的“格里生”伞齿轮机，这种精密机床是著名难使用难调整的，又无专家指导使用。我们为了要掌握这种机器，曾组织了一个研究小组，包括两名大学生和一批技工，在一位工程师的领导下，经过两年多时间的共同学习，刻苦钻研，细心试产，终于熟练地掌握了这种机器。技术干部与工人的技术水平都提高了，并建立起劳技合作的亲密友谊关系。知识分子出身的技术干部反映：“这是提高、改造技术干部的实际有效的办法。”
    四、发挥与依靠群众的创造性，从实际出发，认真贯彻执行工艺。我们在学习掌握技术的工作中，对于苏联汽车工业多年来的丰富工艺经验和技术结晶，应该特别重视与认真学习。我厂在调整生产时，曾经发动与组织了全厂技术干部与工人，认真学习了苏联设计的工艺资料。因此加强了职工的工艺观念，为正确执行工艺，提高技术，生产合格产品，提供了条件。但是，在执行苏联设计的工艺工作中，也必须强调从具体条件出发，不断吸收群众中的创造，才能搞好生产。例如我厂铸工车间，由于使用的原料不符合原设计上的规定，因此，该车间曾发动与组织职工，在生产实践中摸索出适合新条件的工艺，对保证产品质量，学习技术，起了应有的作用。那种不根据具体条件，生搬硬套的非科学态度，不注意吸收群众创造的官僚主义态度，都是有害的。
    五、在生产实践中锻炼提高，必须与系统的、经常性的文化技术学习相结合，才能长期地巩固群众性学习技术的热潮。在系统的业余教育方面，我们执行了“根据不同的人和不同的工作需要，建立多种多样的经常性的业余文化技术学习组织”的方针。总计我厂职工参加夜大学、中等技术学校、技工学校、专业班以及各种学习组织的，已有一万一千多人；其中不少同志已坚持学习了二年多，学习热情很高，收效较大。坚持这样学习，我们预计在四、五年内，可以培养出三百名有生产、技术经验的、夜大学毕业的工程师，可以培养出八百到一千名工人出身的、中等技术学校毕业的技术员；并且使绝大部分转业的做管理工作的领导干部，熟悉自己的业务，达到中等技术学校毕业的程度。
    总之，由于我们注意执行了在学习和掌握技术上走群众路线，努力向苏联学习，向苏联专家学习，才使得我们能够提前试制出首批汽车，并开始能够以每日出产七辆汽车的缓慢速度，全面投入生产。
    但我厂当前存在的问题还很多，工作中还存在着严重的缺点和错误。从现状来看，目前在生产中、工艺上所发生的许多问题，有些尚不能离开苏联专家而独立解决。热处理、铸工车间的产品和发动机的质量都极不稳定；机电设备的检修及复杂工具制造的质量，尚掌握不好；生产效率很低；管理次序不好；废品率大。这一系列的缺点，都说明我们技术水平、管理水平还远远地跟不上生产的需要，我们必须继续发动群众刻苦地学习技术，迅速加强企业的管理工作，才能求得解决。从今后任务来看，我们还要争取在两三年内，全面达到设计能力，并改进汽车设计；还要争取在四、五年内，能创造更新的与更完善、更适合中国的车型和工艺，努力赶上世界汽车工业不断前进的技术水平。所有这些都是极艰巨而光荣的任务。我们一定要发动与依靠全厂职工，保证认真贯彻执行八大决议，积极向苏联专家学习，提前与超额完成我厂第一个五年计划，提前达到设计能力。我们只有长时期勤勤恳恳的努力学习；进一步贯彻实行在学习掌握技术上走群众路线；努力改正缺点和错误；永远戒骄戒躁；更好的贯彻党委集体领导与个人负责制，才能保证完成八大所授予的一切光荣任务。
