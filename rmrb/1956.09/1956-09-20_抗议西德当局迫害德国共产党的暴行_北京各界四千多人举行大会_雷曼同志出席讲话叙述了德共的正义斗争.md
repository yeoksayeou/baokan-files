Xinhua News Agency, 19th. Beijing - More than 4,000 people from all walks of life in Beijing held a meeting at the Music Hall in Zhongshan Park, Beijing this morning to protest against the atrocities of the West German authorities in persecuting the German Communist Party.

    First Secretary Reimann of the German Communist Party and Central Committee Member Hetzner of the German Communist Party were invited to attend the meeting. When they were escorted onto the rostrum by Zhang Xiruo and others, people stood up and cheered and applauded them for as long as five minutes, expressing their warm welcome.

    Zhang Xiruo, Chairman of the Beijing Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, spoke at the meeting. He said that the Hitler-style atrocity of the West German authorities in banning the German Communist Party is not only a brutal trampling on the basic democratic rights of the West German people but also a frenzied provocation to the cause of peace for the people of the world. The people of Beijing, like the people of the whole of China and the peace-loving people of the world, feel extremely indignant at this atrocity of the West German authorities. We express our firm support and cordial condolences to the German Communist Party and to all those who have been persecuted by this fascist atrocity of the West German authorities.

    Zhang Xiruo said, we believe that the struggle currently being waged by the German Communist Party and the German people is an extremely important part of the struggle of the people of the world for peace and democracy. Preventing West Germany from returning to the path of Hitler is the responsibility of the German people and also the responsibility of the peace-loving people of the world. The people of all circles in Beijing must support the struggle of the German Communist Party and the German people with practical actions to strengthen our socialist construction and socialist transformation, and to strengthen the struggle to defend peace.

    Zhang Xiruo said, we believe that although the West German authorities have announced the banning of the German Communist Party, the German Communist Party will never disappear because of this, and the German people will never be intimidated by this. The West German authorities' brutal suppression of the German Communist Party cannot save the bankruptcy of the Adenauer government's policies, nor can it eliminate the deeply rooted influence of the German Communist Party among the German people. On the contrary, all the reactionary measures of the West German authorities can only arouse an even greater wave of struggle by the German people for peace, freedom, and national reunification. The German Communist Party will surely become more consolidated and developed.

    Zhang Xiruo finally wished the German Communist Party and the German people victory in their struggle.

    After Zhang Xiruo spoke, Wang Jiong, Chairman of the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions, spoke. He said: "Please convey our sentiments to the German Communist Party, the West German working class, and the West German people from Comrade Reimann, who is attending today's meeting. The workers of Beijing, like the 600 million people of the whole of China, will always stand with you and firmly support your struggle. At the same time, we must strengthen our strength to defend world peace with practical actions to accelerate production."

    Wang Jiong said that the workers of Beijing solemnly warn the West German authorities here: The era of fascism's rampant tyranny is gone forever. Hitler was once the flag-bearer of anti-Soviet and anti-communism, but ended up being recorded in history as a historical sinner. Japanese militarists once launched the "Greater East Asia" war of aggression, and as a result, were judged by the people. If the Adenauer clique dares to follow Hitler's path, it will meet the same end as Hitler.

    At the meeting, Zhang Wei, a professor at Tsinghua University, Wang Guang, a worker at Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, and Mao Tengshu, a student at Beijing Medical College, also spoke successively. They all indignantly protested against the atrocities of the West German authorities and expressed their firm support for the struggle of the German Communist Party and the German people.

    When First Secretary Reimann of the German Communist Party spoke, the entire audience stood up, erupting in thunderous applause. Reimann narrated the current struggle being waged by the German Communist Party and the West German people. He said that the German Communist Party cannot be eradicated. A party that works wholeheartedly for the happiness and welfare of all working people cannot be banned. The German Communist Party is still there and will continue to exist there. Because it is flesh and blood related to the German working class and the German people (the full text of the speech will be published separately). Reimann's speech was constantly interrupted by applause. When he finished speaking, people once again stood up and applauded for a long time, and constantly shouted: "Long live the German Communist Party!" "Long live the friendship between the Chinese and German people!"

    The meeting finally passed a resolution protesting against the West German authorities' persecution of the German Communist Party (the full text will be published separately).

    Today's attendees included Li Dequan, Vice Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, Chen Shutong, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, Zhang Youyu, Deputy Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, Shu Sheyu, Vice Chairman of the Beijing Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, and Beijing workers, farmers, intellectuals, and government cadres.

    抗议西德当局迫害德国共产党的暴行
    北京各界四千多人举行大会
    雷曼同志出席讲话叙述了德共的正义斗争
    新华社19日讯　北京市各界人民四千多人今天上午在北京中山公园音乐堂举行大会，抗议西德当局迫害德国共产党的暴行。
    德国共产党第一书记雷曼和德国共产党中央委员赫茨纳应邀出席大会，当他们由张奚若等陪同登上主席台的时候，人们站立起来向他们欢呼、鼓掌达五分钟之久，表示对他们的热烈欢迎。
    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会北京市分会主席张奚若在大会上讲话。他说，西德当局取缔德国共产党的希特勒式的暴行，不仅是对西德人民基本民主权利的粗暴的蹂躏，而且是对全世界人民争取和平事业的一次疯狂的挑衅。北京市人民，同全中国人民、全世界爱好和平的人民一样，对西德当局的这种暴行，感到极大的愤慨。我们对德国共产党、对一切受到西德当局这种法西斯暴行迫害的人，表示坚决的声援和亲切的慰问。
    张奚若说，我们认为德国共产党和德国人民目前所进行的斗争，就是全世界人民争取和平民主事业的斗争的极其重要的一部分。防止西德重新走上希特勒的道路，是德国人民的责任，也是全世界爱好和平人民的责任。我们北京市各界人民要以加强我们的社会主义建设和社会主义改造，加强保卫和平的斗争的实际行动，来支持德国共产党和德国人民的斗争。
    张奚若说，我们相信，虽然西德当局宣布取缔德国共产党，但是德国共产党决不会因此而消失，德国人民也决不会因此就被吓倒。西德当局对德国共产党的野蛮镇压，并不能挽救阿登纳政府政策的破产，并不能消除德国共产党在德国人民中的根深蒂固的影响。相反地，西德当局一切反动措施，只能激起德国人民为和平、自由和国家重新统一而斗争的更加巨大的浪潮。德国共产党必将更加巩固和发展。
    张奚若最后祝德国共产党和德国人民的斗争取得胜利。
    在张奚若讲话后，北京市工会联合会主席王炯讲话。他说：“请出席今天大会的亲爱的雷曼同志，向德国共产党、西德工人阶级和西德人民，转达我们的心意，北京市的工人和全中国六亿人民一样，永远跟你们站在一起，坚决支持你们的斗争。同时，我们要以加紧生产的实际行动，来加强我们保卫世界和平的力量。”
    王炯说，北京市工人在这里庄严地警告西德当局：法西斯主义横行霸道的时代已经一去不复返了。希特勒曾经是反苏反共的旗手，结果却以历史的罪人载入史册。日本军国主义分子，曾经发动“大东亚”侵略战争，结果受到了人民的判决。阿登纳集团如果胆敢沿着希特勒的道路走下去，也就会遭到和希特勒一样的下场。
    大会上，清华大学教授张维、石景山钢铁厂工人王广、北京医学院学生毛腾淑也相继讲话。他们一致激愤地抗议西德当局的暴行，并且表示坚决支持德国共产党和德国人民的斗争。
    当德国共产党第一书记雷曼讲话的时候，全场起立，暴发了雷鸣般的掌声。雷曼叙述了德国共产党和西德人民目前进行的斗争。他说，德国共产党是不可能被根绝的。一个全心全意为了一切劳动者的幸福和福利而工作的党，是不可能被取缔的。德国共产党还在那里，并且在那里存在下去。因为它同德国工人阶级、德国人民是血肉相关的（讲话全文另发）。雷曼的讲话不断为掌声打断。当他讲话结束时，人们又一次起立长久地鼓掌，并且不断高呼：“德国共产党万岁！”“中德人民友谊万岁！”
    大会最后通过了抗议西德当局迫害德国共产党的决议（全文另发）。
    今天出席大会的有中华全国民主妇女联合会副主席李德全，中华全国工商业联合会主任委员陈叔通，中共北京市委副书记张友渔，中国人民保卫世界和平委员会北京市分会副主席舒舍予和北京工人、农民、知识分子以及机关干部等。
