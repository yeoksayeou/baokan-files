Comrades, I extend to you, to the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the fraternal and heartfelt greetings of the Italian কমিউনিস্ট Party, the Italian working class, and the democratic progressive forces of the Italian people.

Today in Italy, there is an unprecedented and growing strong interest in everything concerning the life and activities of the Chinese people. Our people are increasingly aware that the victory of the Chinese revolution is one of the great historical events that has left a deep mark on human history. It has powerfully advanced the progressive forces of the world, strengthened the cause of peace, and brought new inspiration and strength to the struggle of all peoples for freedom, independence, and against the colonial imperialist enslavement. All those who are full of confidence in the new and beautiful future of mankind and struggle for it express sympathy and admiration for you, comrades, for what the Communist Party of China, the main creator of such a great event, has already done and will do for the progress, welfare, and independence of your people. Today, you have presented to your people and to the world a great summary full of achievements and victories. You have forever eradicated the decadent rule of feudalism and capitalist imperialism in a great country; you have ensured freedom and independence for the people; you have opened up a new path of progress and welfare in peace and freedom. You have given new life to a great people and unfolded before them the prospect of a more noble and humane civilization—socialist civilization.

The fact that hundreds of millions of people have become conscious masters of their own destiny and are moving towards a new future with great enthusiasm is clearly one of the most moving aspects of new China. But for us, the political and moral unity established among the Chinese people is even more prominent, when, not long ago, the Chinese people were still divided by some deep contradictions and serious internal struggles. This unity of the people marks the greatness of your victory and the superiority of the People's Republic over any previous system. This national unity is the final verdict on a past of poverty and enslavement that cannot return. From now on, only some ghosts remain—those who dream of an unrealizable restoration and who are destined to become the garbage of history in the end. The Chinese people will never turn back on the road: this is the reality that this Congress reveals to the world.

Following the glorious Soviet revolution, which first opened the road to the future for mankind, the founding of the People's Republic of China is a new and great historical event, which can become a source of useful lessons for people. For us Italians, it is precisely this, providing us with a lesson of great importance that will have a direct impact on the current situation in our country.

In your long and heroic national liberation struggle, you achieved a broad united front from the working class to the national bourgeoisie. This was a natural thing in China, which had to fight to get rid of imperialist colonial enslavement. However, it is something new and of great importance that you have maintained and consolidated unity with the national bourgeoisie even after achieving liberation and completing basic democratic reforms, when you presented to the whole country the prospect of democratic development towards socialism. This unity of the people has certainly been one of the main factors in your achievements and victories. It is precisely because of this unique aspect of your policy that Italian workers and democratic forces have followed your Party's Congress with special attention and strong interest, because we can find in it beneficial factors for carrying out political activities in Italy.

The Italian people have indeed experienced similar experiences to yours, but also opposite experiences. During the War of Liberation, a broad democratic and national united front was also achieved in our country. On the basis of this unity, the fascist rule was overthrown, the dynasty was overthrown, a democratic republic was established, and a new constitution was won that paved the way for profound political, economic, and social reforms in Italian society and for democratic development towards socialism. But afterwards, due to the joint actions of foreign imperialism and domestic conservative and reactionary groups, this united front disintegrated. As a result, the progressive activities of the Italian people have been obstructed: the Constitution has not been implemented, reforms have not been carried out, and even the democratic freedoms that are constantly threatened and undermined must still be maintained by the actions and strength of the masses. In order to move forward again, the unity of the democratic progressive forces in our country must be regained. In Italy, this is possible. Elections in recent years have shown that the majority of our country is increasingly turning to the left. A driving force leading to the unity of the people's forces has emerged from the broad masses to strive for the realization of the current Constitution, the realization of profound economic and social reforms, and the striving for a positive policy of easing tensions and peace. Under the pressure of this situation, the question of "Socialist Party unification" has been raised.

In Italy, there is a strong Socialist Party that cooperates with the Communist Party, and a small Social Democratic Party that cooperates with conservative and anti-communist forces. The two parties have agreed to carry out joint actions and look forward to achieving unification in the future. The Communist Party believes that this initiative is positive if it can strengthen and expand the unity of the working class, maintain and advance the position in the struggle for easing tensions and peace, for freedom, the Constitution, and economic and social reforms and progress; if it can facilitate the unity of the people's democratic forces and thus create conditions for completely changing the situation and political direction. In this case, this initiative can develop exactly in the direction required, promoting the forces of democratic progress.

But this policy also brings some difficulties and serious dangers—the reactionary forces are trying to create new divisions in the working class and push the democratic forces out of their acquired positions. In this case, it would not be a step forward in the situation but a step backward. Of course, the socialist party workers are also well aware of this danger, and they will not abandon the results achieved through many joint actions. The Communist Party is using its own strength—two and a half million adult and young members (5% of the country's population), and six million votes—to serve the common cause and overcome this danger. The Communist Party is and will remain the strongest party of Italian workers, without which it is impossible to achieve any unity of the people's forces. On the other hand, the cooperation between the Communists and the Socialists has reached twenty years, and in the turbulent period of Italian history, solid and far-reaching ties have been established, which cannot be destroyed or eliminated at once.

The question of "Socialist Party unification" will inevitably become the target of debate and political struggle. It is in this struggle that we can use the experience gained from the Communist Party of China and specifically raised by this Congress to deal with our enemies. Some people reject any joint action with the Communists, accusing the Communists of demanding democracy today in order to destroy it tomorrow, and demanding joint action with other parties in order to exclude these parties later and establish their own "one-party dictatorship." To all these people, we can answer them with your experience. Your experience proves the absurdity of such accusations with eloquent facts. In China, even after the victory of the revolution led by the Communist Party, other parties were not only not eliminated, but on the contrary, the Communist Party demanded and encouraged them to become increasingly active members with political and supervisory roles, which is certainly a manifestation of profound democratic spirit. Some people will say that China is not Italy, that's right. But, under different political conditions, the main thing is to look at the direction and principles that guide us in action. And these are the same for all Communists. Comrade Mao Zedong said in his opening speech that we all speak in different forms, but we speak the same language: Marxism-Leninism.

The 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union correctly criticized the mistakes of the past and put forward political and ideological principles, providing the Communist Parties of all countries with a new and broader prospect for the development of the workers' movement. Your Congress has confirmed the correctness of these principles and enriched the international workers' movement with new and unique experiences.

We will convey your experience to the Italian workers, and your experience provides new and valuable lessons for our actions and struggles.

Comrades! Your Congress has strengthened our confidence in the victory of socialism, and around the banner of its victory, the people of the world will unite in a spirit of brotherhood.

Long live the international solidarity of the workers and peoples of all countries against capitalism and imperialism!

Long live the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China!

Long live the victory of peace, freedom, and socialism!

    意大利共产党代表团团长斯科奇马罗同志致词
    同志们，我向你们，向中国共产党第八次代表大会致以意大利共产党、意大利工人阶级和意大利人民的民主进步力量的兄弟般的亲切的敬礼。
    今天在意大利，对于有关中国人民生活和活动的一切事物，都有着前所未有的、日益增长的强烈兴趣。我国人民愈益广泛地意识到中国革命的胜利是伟大的历史事件之一，这一事件在人类历史上留下了深刻的痕迹。它有力地向前推进了全世界进步力量，加强了和平事业；为各国人民争取自由、独立、反对殖民帝国主义奴役的斗争带来了新的激励和力量。所有对于人类新的、美好的将来满怀信心并为之斗争的人们，都对你们，同志们，对曾经是这样一个伟大事件的主要缔造者的中国共产党为了你们人民的进步、福利与独立所已经做的和将要做的事情，表示同情和钦佩。你们今天向你们的人民，向全世界提出了满载成就和胜利的伟大的总结。你们在一个伟大的国家中永远铲除了封建主义和资本帝国主义的腐朽统治；你们为人民确保了自由和独立；你们在和平自由中开辟了一条进步与福利的新的道路。你们使一个伟大的人民获得了新生，并为他们展开了更崇高、更人道的文明——社会主义文明——的远景。
    数亿人民成为自身命运的自觉主人并以巨大的热情迈向新的未来，这显然是新中国的最动人的方面之一。但是对于我们来说，在中国人民中建立起来的政治上和道义上的团结显然更为突出，在不久前，中国人民还被一些深刻的矛盾和严重的国内斗争所分裂。人民的这种团结标志着你们胜利的伟大，标志着人民共和国较之以前任何一种制度都要优越。这种全民的团结是对不能卷土重来的贫困和奴役的过去的最后判决。从此，只是残存下来一些幽灵——那些梦想着无法实现的复辟，而将注定最后成为历史垃圾的人们。中国人民永远不会在路上回头：这就是这次大会向全世界揭示的现实。
    在首先为人类开辟了通向未来的道路的光荣的苏维埃革命之后，中华人民共和国的成立是一次新的伟大的历史性事件，它可以成为人们汲取有益教训的泉源。对于我们意大利人来说，它正是这样的，它为我们提供了一个对我国目前形势会有直接影响的、具有巨大重要性的教训。
    在你们长期的、英勇的民族解放斗争中，你们实现了从工人阶级到民族资产阶级的广泛的统一战线。这在中国必须为摆脱帝国主义殖民奴役而斗争的时期中，曾经是一件自然的事情。但是，在取得了解放并完成了基本的民主改革后，当你们向全国提出了向社会主义民主发展的远景时，你们仍保持并巩固了与民族资产阶级的团结，这却是一件新的、具有巨大重要性的事情。人民的这种团结肯定地曾是你们取得成就和胜利的主要因素之一。正是由于你们政策的这一独特方面，意大利劳动者和民主力量以特别的注意和强烈的兴趣，注视着你们党的这次大会，因为我们从其中可以找到对我们在意大利开展政治活动有益的因素。
    意大利人民确实曾经历了与你们相似的经验，但也有相反的经验。解放战争时，在我国也曾实现过广泛的民主、民族统一战线。在这个团结的基础上，推翻了法西斯统治，打倒了王朝，建立了民主共和国，争取到了一部为在意大利社会中进行深刻的政治、经济、社会革新并为走向社会主义的民主发展开辟道路的新宪法。但是，之后，由于外国帝国主义和国内保守、反动集团的联合行动，这个统一战线瓦解了。于是，意大利人民的进步活动被阻住了：宪法未实现，改革未进行，甚至不断受到威胁和破坏的民主自由仍必须由人民群众的行动和力量来加以维护。为了重新向前挺进，必须重新取得我国民主进步力量的团结。在意大利，这是可能的。近几年来的选举表明我国的多数日益向左转。从广大的群众中产生了一股导向人民力量团结的推动力，以争取实现现宪法，实现深刻的经济、社会改革，争取一个缓和紧张局势及和平的积极政策。在这种形势的压力下，提出了“社会党统一”问题。
    在意大利存在着一个与共产党合作的强大的社会党，和一个与保守、反共势力合作的社会民主小党。这两个党同意开展共同行动并展望以后获致统一。共产党认为这一创议是积极的，如果它能加强和扩大工人阶级的团结，保持和推进在争取缓和局势及和平、争取自由、宪法和经济、社会改革及进步的斗争中的阵地；如果它能便利人民民主力量的团结并因而为彻底改变局势和政治方向创造条件的话。在这种情况下，这一创议就能恰好按所要求的方向发展，推动民主进步的力量。
    但这一政策也带来了一些困难和严重的危险——反动势力企图在工人阶级中造成新的分裂并把民主力量从其已取得的阵地中排挤出去。在这种情况下，就不是局势向前推进一步而是后退一步。当然，社会党员劳动者也是很了解这一危险的，他们不会放弃经过多少次共同行动而取得的成果。共产党正以其本身的力量——二百五十万成年和青年党员（占全国人口5％），和六百万选票——来为共同事业服务，克服这一危险。共产党是并且仍将是意大利劳动者最强大的党，没有它就不可能实现人民力量的任何团结。另方面，共产党人与社会党人之间的合作已达二十年，在意大利历史上动荡的时期中，已建立了牢固和深远的联系，这些联系不是一下子能予摧毁或消除的。
    “社会党统一”问题不可避免地将成为争论和政治斗争的目标。正是在这个斗争中，我们可以把从中国共产党获得来的并且由这次大会特别提出来的经验用来对付我们的敌人。有人排斥与共产党人一起进行的任何共同行动，指控共产党人今天要求民主是为了明天摧毁它，要求与其他党派采取共同行动是为了以后排除这些党派并建立自己的“一党专政”。对所有这些人们，我们可以以你们的经验来回答他们。你们的经验以雄辩的事实证明这类指控的荒谬。在中国，即使在由共产党领导的革命胜利以后，其他党派不但没有被消灭，而且正相反，共产党要求他们并鼓励他们成为有政治作用和监督作用的日益积极的分子，这当然是深刻的民主精神的表现。有人会说中国不是意大利，不错。但是，在不同的政治条件下，主要的是看在行动中指导我们的方针和原则。而这些对所有共产党人都是一样的。毛泽东同志在他的开幕词中说，我们讲话的形式各有不同，但是我们却讲同一种语言：马克思列宁主义。
    苏联共产党第二十次代表大会对过去的错误进行了正确的批判并提出了政治和思想原则，为各国共产党提供了工人运动新的、更广阔的发展的远景。你们的大会证实了这些原则的正确性，并以新的、独特的经验丰富了国际工人运动。
    我们将把你们的经验传达给意大利劳动者，你们的经验为我们的行动和斗争提供了新的和宝贵的教益。
    同志们！你们的大会加强了我们对社会主义胜利的信心，在它的胜利的旗帜的周围，全世界的人民将以兄弟般的精神团结起来。
    各国劳动者和人民反对资本主义和帝国主义的国际团结万岁！
    中国共产党第八次代表大会万岁！
    和平、自由、社会主义的胜利万岁！
