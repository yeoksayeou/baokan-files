Moscow, September 13th (Reported by our newspaper) The Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic has fulfilled this year's national milk procurement plan four months ahead of schedule. The total amount of milk delivered and sold to the state by the republic is 3,234,000 tons, an increase of one million tons compared to last year. Milk delivery is still in progress, and an additional 7,000 tons is expected to be delivered above the plan by the end of the year. The milk production of dairy cows on farms in some states and districts of the republic has reached the planned production level for 1960.

The reason for the republic's early completion of the milk production plan is due to the creative labor of collective farm members and state farm workers, which increased the milk yield of dairy cows. From October 1, 1955, to September 1, 1956, the amount of milk squeezed from collective farm dairy cows increased to 1,526,000 tons, an increase of almost 55% compared to the same period last year. In these eleven months, the average milk yield per dairy cow on collective farms was 1,794 kilograms, which is 510 kilograms more milk per cow than in the same period in previous years. The milk yield of dairy cows on collective farms in the Chervano-Armosk district and the Chaibalozk state has exceeded the planned output for 1960. The Sixth Five-Year Plan stipulates that the planned milk yield per dairy cow at the end of 1960 should be 2,370 kilograms, but in these two districts, the milk yield per dairy cow in the eleven months of this year has reached 2,422 kilograms.

In addition, the rapid increase in milk yield of dairy cows in this republic is due to the increase in corn silage feed. The corn planting area in the entire republic has expanded to seven million hectares this year, an increase of 1.5 million hectares compared to last year. Feeding dairy cows with corn feed has resulted in a rapid increase in milk production.

The republic's milk processing factories have overfulfilled the cream processing plan by 133% during the same period.

    苏联乌克兰今年多生产一百万吨牛奶
    提前四个月完成了国家牛奶采购计划
    本报莫斯科13日电　苏联乌克兰联邦共和国提前四个月完成了今年的国家牛奶采购计划。这共和国上交与出售给国家的牛奶总数为三百二十三万四千吨，比去年增多了一百万吨。目前上交牛奶还在继续中，到年底还可以超计划上交七千吨。共和国部分州、区农庄奶牛产奶量已达到1960年计划生产水平。
    这共和国提前完成牛奶生产计划的原因是由于各地集体农庄庄员与国营农场工人创造性地劳动，提高了奶牛出奶量。1955年10月1日到1956年9月1日集体农庄奶牛挤奶量增加到了一百五十二万六千吨，比去年同一时期差不多增加了55％。这十一个月里集体农庄每条奶牛平均出奶为一千七百九十四公斤。比往年同时期每条奶牛多出牛奶五百一十公斤。共和国的契尔瓦诺阿尔莫斯克区与柴巴洛兹克州的集体农庄奶牛出奶量超过1960年的计划产量。第六个五年计划规定，在1960年计划结束时每条奶牛的产奶量为二千三百七十公斤，但这二个区的农庄在今年十一个月内，每条奶牛的产奶量已达到了二千四百二十二公斤。
    另外，这共和国奶牛出奶量迅速增加是由于增加了玉米青贮饲料。全共和国今年玉米播种面积扩大到了七百万公顷，比去年增多了一百五十万公顷。用玉米饲料喂养奶牛，出奶量迅速增长。
    这共和国的牛奶加工工厂在同时间内超额133％完成了奶油加工。
