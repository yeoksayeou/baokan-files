    A Few Words About Mooncakes
  　Wei Jinzhi
    I've eaten old-fashioned Beijing mooncakes, and frankly, they are not to be recommended. Although the names of Beijing mooncakes are quite elegant, even I, who don't particularly enjoy snacks, was once attracted to them and bought one of each kind. But after trying one after another, despite the different names, the contents were all the same: a mushy, bland filling, far inferior to Cantonese, Ningbo, or Suzhou mooncakes, and even worse than the mooncakes from my hometown. I'm very interested in Beijing, but I just can't bring myself to like the old-fashioned Beijing mooncakes, so I dare not try them again.
    This year's summer in Shanghai was terribly hot, and I hardly read a book or wrote a word during the entire period. Fortunately, summer has passed, and I immediately resumed my nighttime work. After working for a few days, I often felt hungry in the middle of the night, so I thought about preparing some food. Just then, I saw news in the newspaper that mooncakes were on the market, saying they had ham, jujube paste, and fine bean paste fillings, seemingly "all kinds of flavors" and "nothing lacking," so I thought I would buy a few. Coincidentally, I went to Nanjing Road on Sunday, so I ventured into the Shanghai Food Company to buy mooncakes. Looking at their appearance, they were golden and plump, which seemed pretty good, so I bought a few at random. But upon tasting them, the "jujube paste" turned out to be just a symbolic bit of fine bean paste, mainly made of maltose syrup and flour, mushy and bland, exactly like the old-fashioned Beijing mooncakes.
    My memory isn't great, but it's not too bad either. I remember that last year, the mooncakes produced by Shanghai's Xing Hua Lou, were one jiao each for jujube paste and one jiao and a half each for ham. I can't recall the exact weight, but the contents seemed better, at least the filling wasn't as mushy and bland. In terms of form, they also seemed more substantial, not like now—looking swollen-faced and pretending to be fat, so puffed up and yet so empty. So, I can only sigh.
    Hearing my sigh, someone asked me: "Are you shaking your head and sighing for the old-fashioned Beijing mooncakes? Or for Shanghai mooncakes' cutting corners?" I can honestly say that the problem lies in not cutting corners but reducing the ingredients. Looking at the current mooncakes, there's no similarity to Beijing mooncakes in form at all, and they're quite pretty, showing no intention of following Beijing's example. But the content, however, is mushy and bland, exactly the same as the old-fashioned Beijing mooncakes. Why is this? It's simply wanting to hang the signboard of Ningbo or Suzhou mooncakes, while selling genuine old-fashioned Beijing mooncakes!
    However, someone else said: "Now the North is suffering from floods, and the South has typhoons. Other people's lives are in question, and you're leisurely discussing mooncakes. Let me tell you, giving more profits to the state will allow more relief funds to be allocated, so isn't this like eating mooncakes and helping with disaster relief at the same time?" This reasoning seems good, but I don't agree with this view. I advocate that we should help our compatriots who are suffering from disasters, and do so with "regarding others' hunger as our own hunger, others' drowning as our own drowning." This is worthy of our saving on food and clothing, to prepare for unforeseen circumstances and to meet the needs of the country. But it's definitely not necessary to reduce one qian of sugar in mooncakes, a few strands of yarn in shirts, a piece of leather in leather shoes, or to eat moldy and red rotten rice. Because the state has given us standards, which are to be fast, good, plentiful, and economical. The state definitely doesn't want to earn a few extra dollars outside of this, let alone make the people suffer more.
    Besides, in recent years, our country has made progress, both spiritually and even more so materially. But some of our comrades still like to reduce one qian of sugar in mooncakes, a few strands of yarn in shirts, a piece of leather in leather shoes, and even make the people eat moldy rice. If there's any dissatisfaction, they'll slap a big label on you, calling you "not having high socialist enthusiasm," or even not loving the country. As if only those of us who like to sell shoddy goods to the people have high socialist enthusiasm and love the country.
    In terms of motivation, I definitely don't doubt the motivation of these comrades. In any case, the money won't be going into their own pockets. However, we must say that doing so will inevitably damage the credibility of state-owned enterprises. Honestly, as long as everyone frowns when eating mooncakes, it's not a good thing. Don't casually use the country's credibility as your own shield!

    闲话月饼
  　魏金枝
    我吃过北京的老式月饼，老实说，北京的老式月饼是要不得的。尽管北京月饼的名目很文雅，连我这个不大喜欢吃小食的人，也曾经为它们所吸引，每种都买了一个。但吃了一种又一种，名目尽管不同，内容还是一样，馅子是糊稀稀的，淡绰绰的，远不如广式的、宁式的、苏式的，甚至比我们乡下的月饼也差得远。我对北京很有兴趣，但对北京的老式月饼，却无论如何也生不出兴趣来，因此再也不敢请教了。
    今年上海的暑天实在太热，整个暑期的夜间，简直没有看过一本书，写过几个字。幸得暑天过去了，我就马上恢复夜间工作。搞了几天之后，常常觉得夜半肚饿，于是想预备一点吃的。正在这时，在报上看到月饼上市的消息，说有火腿的，枣泥的，细沙的，似乎是“色色俱有”，“无美不备”，我就想去买几个。说来也巧，星期天正好上南京路去，我就闯进上海食品公司去买月饼。看看外貌，黄喷喷的，胖鼓鼓的，倒也不错，就随便买了几个。可是上口一吃，枣泥的原来只是象征性的一点儿细沙，主要的是饧糖和了面粉，糊稀稀的，淡绰绰的，完全和北京的老式月饼一样。
    我的记忆力并不好，但也不太健忘。我记得，去年上海杏花楼出产的月饼，也是枣泥的一角一只，火腿的一角半一只，分量怎样，无从说起了，但内容似乎还要好一些，至少馅子不是这么糊稀稀的，淡绰绰的。论形式，也似乎要实在得多，不像现在这个样子——被打肿面孔而充胖子那么饱鼓鼓的而又虚海海的。于是，我只得慨叹了。
    听了我的慨叹，就有人问我：你这么摇头叹气，到底是为了老式的北京月饼呢？还是为了上海月饼的偷工减料呢？我可以老实说，问题就在于不偷工而减料。照现在的月饼看来，形式上并没有丝毫和北京月饼相似之处，而且是蛮漂亮的，可见决没有向北京看齐的意思；但是内容呢，却是糊稀稀的，淡绰绰的，完全和北京的老式月饼相同。这为什么？无非想挂宁式的苏式的招牌，而出卖实实在在的老式的北京月饼！
    然而又有人说了：“现在北方在闹水灾，南方则有风灾，别人生活还成问题，你倒嫌精论肥地谈起月饼来了。告诉你，给国家多一些上缴，也就可以多拨一些救济费，这不是又吃月饼又赈了灾么？”这个道理好像不错，但是我却并不同意这样的意见。我主张我们应该救济遭灾的同胞，而且做到“人饥如己饥，人溺如己溺”，这就值得我们节衣缩食，以备不时之患，以应国家的需要。但决不须要在月饼里少一钱糖，在汗衫上少几根纱，在皮鞋上少一块皮，在粮食上又是又霉又红的烂米。因为这里有国家给我们规定的标准，是又快又好又多又省，国家决不要在这以外多赚几个钱，更说不上多给人民吃一些亏。
    于此以外，这几年以来，我们的国家是有进步的，精神上如此，物质上更加如此。但是我们的某些同志，却老喜欢在月饼上少一钱糖，在汗衫上少几根纱，在皮鞋上少一块皮，而且还要给人民吃霉烂的米，一有不满，便扣他一顶大帽子，叫做“社会主义热情不高”，甚至于连国也不爱。仿佛只有我们这些喜欢把粗制滥造的货色推销给人民的人，才是社会主义热情很高，也很爱国似的。
    论动机，我决不怀疑这些同志的动机，无论如何，钱总不会是落到他们自己的腰包里去的。然而我们必得说，这么做，必然会损害国营企业的威信。老实说，只要每个人在吃月饼时皱一皱眉毛，就不是一件好事情。不要把国家的威信，随便作为自己的挡箭牌吧！
