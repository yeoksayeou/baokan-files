Xinhua News Agency, Changdu, 10th. In the past month, when driving on the plateau during the rainy season has been difficult, more than one thousand tons of supplies from the interior have been transported to Changdu in eastern Tibet via the Kang-Tibet Highway. These supplies include general merchandise, grain, and building materials.

The large quantities of supplies transported to Changdu are being successively transferred from here to Lhasa and other places. The machinery and equipment for the Lhasa Hydroelectric Power Station, which is under construction, were transported to Lhasa last month. Local and special products such as wool and medicinal materials produced in the Changdu area are also continuously transported to the interior via the Kang-Tibet Highway.

    大批物资运到康藏高原
    新华社昌都10日电　在高原雨季行车困难的最近一个月中，又有一千多吨内地物资经康藏公路运到西藏东部的昌都，这些物资包括日用百货、粮食和建筑器材等。
    运到昌都的大批物资正陆续从这里转运到拉萨等地。正在建设中的拉萨水力发电站的机器设备，就是在上月运到拉萨的。昌都地区出产的羊毛、药材等土产、特产品也不断经康藏公路运往内地。
