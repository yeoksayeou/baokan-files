    Workers' Living Problems Being Solved

    A letter from the Hankou Channel Engineering Zone of the Yangtze River Navigation Administration states: The article "Why Ignore Our Suffering?" published in the People's Daily on July 10 was a correct criticism of us. We have not paid enough attention to the lives of sailors and workers. For example, regarding the sleeping quarters for the crew of the Chain Bucket No. 1 dredger and the water bottles needed by the workers, we had already requested these from higher authorities when formulating the "Safety Technology Labor Protection Measures Plan" this year. However, due to our lack of initiative, these two issues were delayed for a long time without being resolved. Another example is the workers' need for life jackets. Because the originally equipped ones were not suitable for use in the channel, they had to be modified. However, because we only discussed it with higher authorities through official correspondence and lacked specific measures, the problem has been delayed and remains unresolved. We are preparing to take the following measures:

    I. Regarding the problem of sleeping quarters for the crew of the Chain Bucket No. 1 dredger, we are currently planning to rent civilian houses near the construction site to solve this issue.

    II. Regarding the supply of life jackets, we have already ordered 500 kapok vest-style life jackets in Shanghai, and the original 200 life jackets can continue to be used. In this way, all of our district's waterborne staff will be allocated one.

    III. Regarding the construction of station buildings for navigation mark stations and the water bottles for navigation mark operators, except for the station buildings, which are related to the state's basic construction plan and need to be resolved gradually, we are actively negotiating the production of the required water bottles and will soon be able to distribute them comprehensively.

专栏：对批评的反应

    职工生活问题正在解决
    长江航运管理局汉口航道工程区来信说：7月10日人民日报刊载“为什么漠视我们的疾苦”一文，对我们的批评是正确的。我们对船员、工人们的生活是关心不够的。如链斗一号挖泥船船员的睡觉场所和工人所需的饮水瓶，我们在今年制定“安全技术劳动保护措施计划”时，即已向上级提出要求，但是由于我们的主动性不够，这两个问题拖延了很长时间也没有得到解决。又如工人们需要救生衣，因为原来上级配备的不适合在航道内应用，必须改制。但是由于我们只是在公文往返中和上级研究，缺乏具体措施，以致拖延至今迄未解决。我们准备采取下列措施：
    一、关于链斗一号挖泥船船员的睡觉场所问题，现正筹划在工地觅租民房来解决。
    二、关于救生衣的供应问题，已在上海订制木棉背心式救生衣五百件，原配备的救生衣还有二百件可以继续使用。这样，我区全体水上工作人员都可分配到一件。
    三、关于航标站站房的修建和航标员的饮水瓶问题，除站房关系国家基本建设计划，有待逐步解决外，所需饮水瓶现正在积极洽制中，不久即可全面分配。
