Xinhua News Agency, Bangkok, September 4th: The "Universal Daily News" in Thailand published an editorial on August 29th, calling for improved relations between Thailand and China.

The editorial stated, "Thailand and China have had connections since ancient times, but cooperation with the United States against communism has severed the good ties between Thailand and China."

The "Universal Daily News" pointed out that it is not sustainable for the United States and Thailand to restrict themselves from associating with 600 million people. It said that this is very unsatisfactory to the Americans, "and even more unsatisfactory to the Thai people, who have been friendly with the Chinese people since ancient times. Because Thailand's border is close to China, and the overseas Chinese residing in Thailand live in harmony with the Thai people like relatives. It is difficult to prohibit exchanges between neighbors and close relatives."

    泰国“永恒报”要求改善泰中关系
    据新华社4日讯　曼谷消息：“永恒报”8月29日发表社论，要求改善泰国和中国的关系。
    社论说，“泰国同中国自古以来就有着联系，但是由于和美国合作反对共产党，已使得泰国和中国之间的良好联系，遭受割断”。
      “永恒报”指出，美国和泰国自己限制自己不同六亿人结交，这是不能长期维持下去的。它说，这是令人非常不满的，美国人不满，“自古以来就同中国人民友好的泰国人民更加不满。因为泰国国境和中国相接近，居住在泰国的华侨同泰国人民之间就像亲属一样地和睦相处。要禁止邻人和关系密切的亲友之间往来是困难的”。
