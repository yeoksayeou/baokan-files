Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, September 1st: "Indonesian Torch" newspaper said that the government's special committee investigation results show that the August 13th incident had major domestic and international purposes. This is an inseparable part of the effort by colonialist forces to subvert the Indonesian Republic from within.

The August 13th incident refers to the then-Third Military Region Commander Kawilarang ordering the arrest of Indonesian Foreign Minister Abdulgani on charges of corruption on the eve of his departure to attend the London conference. The special committee organized by the government, after investigation, has declared that there is no reason to suspect Abdulgani of illegal behavior.

"East Star Daily" demands an investigation into the background of the August 13th incident. This newspaper said that the commanders of the August 13th incident, under the pretext of fighting corruption, attempted to sabotage the Indonesian nation from within and without.

"Republic Daily" said that the results of the government's special committee investigation confirmed an attempt to overthrow the Indonesian government through non-democratic and non-parliamentary means. This newspaper warned the people not to be incited by those ill-intentioned people who use anti-corruption as a pretext.

"Independent Daily" and "People's Daily" both said that if no action is taken against the illegal actions of certain people in the August 13th incident, then democracy will be jeopardized in the future.

    印度尼西亚报纸指出
    逮捕外长事件是颠复阴谋的一部分
    新华社雅加达1日电　“印度尼西亚火炬报”说，政府特别委员会的调查结果表明，8月13日事件有着很大的国内和国际的目的。这是殖民主义力量企图从内部推翻印度尼西亚共和国所作的努力的不可分离的一部分。
    8月13日事件是在印度尼西亚外交部长阿卜杜加尼动身前往参加伦敦会议前夕，当时的第三军区司令卡维拉朗下令以贪污罪名逮捕他。政府所组织的特别委员会在经过调查后，已经宣布没有理由怀疑阿卜杜加尼有违法行为。
    “东星报”要求调查8月13日事件的背景。这家报纸说，8月13日事件的指挥者以反贪污为借口，企图从内部和外部来破坏印度尼西亚国家。
    “共和国报”说，政府特别委员会的调查结果证实了有一种想通过非民主的和非议会的手段来推翻印度尼西亚政府的企图。这家报纸警告人民不要受到那些以反贪污为借口的不怀好意的人们的煽动。
      “独立报”和“人民日报”都说，如果对某些人在8月13日事件中所做的非法行为不采取行动的话，那么，将来民主就要遭到危害。
