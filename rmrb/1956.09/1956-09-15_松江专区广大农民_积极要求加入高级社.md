Broad Masses of Peasants in Songjiang Prefecture
Actively Demand to Join Advanced Cooperatives

(Reported by this newspaper) After seeing the superiority displayed by the advanced agricultural cooperatives, members of primary agricultural cooperatives and individual peasants in Songjiang Prefecture, Jiangsu Province, are actively requesting to join advanced cooperatives before the autumn harvest and planting.

The 997 advanced agricultural cooperatives established in this prefecture this spring have generally increased production this year. The average yield of wheat per mu in the advanced cooperatives was 201 jin, an increase of 11.68% over last year, and 8.65% higher than the yield of primary cooperatives. The wheat in 24 advanced cooperatives in Baihe District, Qingpu County, increased by an average of 20% compared with 19 primary cooperatives, but the production cost was 20% lower. Wudian Township, Nanhui County, was supplied with 380,000 jin of grain by the state last year. After establishing advanced cooperatives this year, the output of early rice and wheat has increased. This year, not only does it not need the state to supply grain, but it also sells 460,000 jin of grain to the state.

In the summer harvest distribution of the entire prefecture, more than 90% of the cooperative members generally increased their income compared to last year. For example, Gu Linxiang, a member of the Heping Advanced Cooperative in Nanhui County, has a family of four. Last year, when he was in the mutual aid team, he received an average of only 220 jin of grain per person. This year, in addition to the 530 jin of wheat and 220 jin of rice already distributed, according to the trial calculation, he can also receive 10 dan of rice and 6 dan of late autumn miscellaneous grains, with an average of 600 jin of grain per person. Zhou Meifang, a female cooperative member who had been begging for food for eighteen years, had a wooden barrel that could store 350 jin of rice, which had never been filled with grain. This year, her family of five has received 25 dan of grain. In addition to filling this wooden barrel, she also bought new wooden barrels to hold the grain. She said excitedly: "This is the first time in my twenty-eight years of marriage that I have received so much grain!"

Many primary cooperative members said: "Climbing the stairs step by step, it is good to see the advanced cooperative horizontally and vertically. If we don't join now, when will we wait?" Individual peasants said: "Now we have seen things clearly. This autumn, we will 'leap to the sky in one step' (referring to directly joining the advanced cooperative)!" Now, according to statistics from Chuansha, Nanhui, and Jiading counties alone, among 543 primary cooperatives and more than 7,900 individual peasant households, 450 primary cooperatives and more than 4,400 individual peasant households have already proposed requests for transferring to and joining the cooperative. The Songjiang Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China and the county committees of various counties have been actively conducting pilot work for upgrading and merging into advanced cooperatives according to the demands of the masses. It is expected that the entire region will achieve advanced agricultural cooperation before the autumn harvest and planting.

    松江专区广大农民
    积极要求加入高级社
    本报讯　江苏省松江专区初级农业社社员和个体农民，在看到高级农业社所显示的优越性后，积极要求在秋收秋种前加入高级社。
    这个专区今春建立的九百九十七个高级农业社，今年普遍增产，高级社的小麦每亩平均产量二百零一斤，比去年增产11.68％，比初级社产量高8.65％。青浦县白鹤区二十四个高级社的小麦，比十九个初级社平均增产二成，但生产成本却低20％。南汇县邬店乡去年由国家供应粮食三十八万斤，今年办起高级社后，早稻、小麦产量都有提高，今年不但不要国家供应粮食，而且还出卖四十六万斤粮食给国家。
    全专区在夏收分配中有90％以上的社员普遍比去年增加了收入。如南汇县和平高级社社员顾林祥，全家有四口人，去年在互助组时，每人平均只收到二百二十斤粮食；今年除已分到五百三十斤小麦和二百二十斤稻谷外，根据试算还可分到十担稻谷和六担晚秋杂粮，平均每人可分到六百斤粮食。讨了十八年饭的女社员周美芳，有一只可以储藏三百五十斤米的木桶，从来没有放满过粮食，今年她家五口人已分到二十五担粮食，除放满这个木桶外，还添置了新木桶来盛粮食。她激动地说：“分这么多粮食，我结婚二十八年来还是头一回！”
    许多初级社社员说：“脚踏楼梯步步高，横看竖看高级社好，现在不入还等何时？”个体农民说：“这下可把事情看透了，今秋要‘一步登天’（指直接加入高级社）！”现在，仅据川沙、南汇、嘉定三县的统计，在五百四十三个初级社和七千九百多户个体农民中，已经有四百五十个初级社和四千四百多户个体农民提出转社入社的要求。中共松江地委和各县县委已根据群众的要求，积极进行升并高级社的试点工作。预计秋收秋种之前，全区即可实现高级农业合作化。
