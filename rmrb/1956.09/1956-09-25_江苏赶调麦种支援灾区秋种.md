Jiangsu Expedites Seed Wheat Transfer to Support Autumn Planting in Disaster Areas

(Our newspaper, Nanjing, 24th) On the Yangtze River, Huai River, and many inland rivers of northern Jiangsu, and on the highways of the Xuhuai Plain, thousands of ships, junks, and many automobiles and horse-drawn carts are working day and night to transport wheat seeds to support farmers in seed-deficient areas such as Huaiyin and Yangzhou for autumn planting. So far, of the more than 250 million jin of seeds that need to be transferred throughout the province, more than 205 million jin have been transported to the seed-deficient counties and districts. Among them, 140 million jin of wheat seeds transferred from Sichuan, Shaanxi, and other provinces are mostly improved varieties of "2419" and "Bi Ma No. 1," and these seeds have a very high germination rate.

This summer, wheat production in Huaiyin, Yangzhou, and other places was reduced due to waterlogging, resulting in a shortage of wheat seeds for autumn planting. To help farmers in disaster areas overcome the difficulty of seed shortage, under the unified leadership and dispatch of relevant central departments, the province dispatched more than 300 cadres to Sichuan and other provinces, as well as the abundant harvest areas of southern Jiangsu within the province, to transfer wheat seeds.

This year, the quantity and scale of wheat seed transfer throughout the province have exceeded any previous year. The transfer work is being carried out with the close cooperation of the agricultural, grain, and transportation departments. The province alone has more than 42,000 tons of ships and more than 47,000 tons of wooden boats participating in the transfer of seeds. Seed transportation stations have been set up in important locations such as Nanjing and Zhenjiang, and wheat seeds are given priority in transportation under the current heavy transportation tasks, and the "straight-line transportation method" is adopted to transport the seeds to counties and districts.

To enable farmers to become familiar with and master the characteristics of the new wheat seeds transferred from other places, various places are currently training technicians to prepare to teach farmers planting techniques. Before autumn planting, Yangzhou Prefecture plans to help agricultural cooperatives train 30,000 to 50,000 technicians to carry out the work of imparting planting techniques.

### 江苏赶调麦种支援灾区秋种

    江苏赶调麦种支援灾区秋种
    本报南京24日电　在江苏省的长江、淮河和苏北地区的许多内河里，在徐淮平原的公路上，成千上万只轮船、木帆船和很多汽车、马车夜以继日地赶运麦种，支援淮阴、扬州等缺乏种子的地区农民进行秋种。到目前为止，全省需要调拨的二亿五千多万斤种子，已有二亿零五千多斤运到各缺种的县、区。其中由四川、陕西等省调来的一亿四千万斤麦种，大部都是“二四一九”和“碧蚂一号”良种，这些种子发芽率都很高。
    今年夏季淮阴、扬州等地小麦受涝减产，因此，秋播麦种缺乏。为了帮助灾区农民克服缺种困难，在中央有关部门统一领导调度下，全省派出三百多个干部分赴四川等省及省内苏南丰收地区调运麦种。
    今年全省调运麦种的数量、规模都超过以往任何一年。调运工作是在农业、粮食和交通运输部门密切配合下进行的。全省参加调运种子的仅轮船就有四万二千多吨，木船四万七千多吨。南京、镇江等重要地点都设置种子运输站，在目前运输任务繁重的情况下，优先调运麦种，并采用“直线运输法”，把种子接运到县、区。
    为使农民能够熟悉和掌握由外地调来的新麦种的特性，目前各地正在训练技术人员，准备向农民传授播种技术。扬州专区在秋种前计划帮助各农业社训练好三万到五万个技术员来进行传授播种技术的工作。
