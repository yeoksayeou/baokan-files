Reflections on Reading Poetry
Wu Ge

Zheng Xie of the Qing dynasty, also known as Zheng Banqiao, famous for his calligraphy and painting, once worked as a village school teacher and composed a jingle:

	"Teaching is originally a lowly job,
	Spending spring and autumn at others' doors.
	Half-starved, half-cold, a leisurely guest,
	Without yoke or lock, a prisoner free.
	Heavy lessons, yet students are lazy,
	Little achievement, yet grudges from the master.
	From now on, change the shrine,
	With the great water buffalo replacing the deities."

This truly expresses the desolate state of mind of a teacher. In the old society, emphasis was placed on "excelling in learning to become an official," and teaching was seen as the last resort for scholars; not only did they spend their days at others' doors, facing the risk of cold and hunger, but also, in the matters of "heavy lessons" and "little achievement," their plight was similar to that of a newlywed bride, rising early to offend the husband, rising late to offend the parents-in-law. Zheng Banqiao's advocacy for replacing the deities in the shrine with a great water buffalo was precisely to protest against social injustice, to angrily lash out at the "upper class," and to imply "sacrificing oneself for others, willingly enduring hardship." Later generations, failing to understand this, said that the old gentleman also looked down on teachers, which is incorrect.

Using the ox to symbolize a person's loyalty, diligence, and willingness to endure hardship without complaint is well-documented. Ancient gentlemen often said when entrusted with a task, "I dare not fail to serve you like an ox or horse at your disposal," ostensibly self-deprecating, but actually self-aggrandizing, expressing a willingness to take on responsibilities. Lu Xun's poem, "Head bowed, I willingly serve as a child's ox," etc., can also serve as evidence for Mr. Banqiao's "ox." However, some cadres now, though not all have read Banqiao's poem, are indeed still treating teachers as "lowly" people. Some have already developed from looking down on this profession to openly insulting teachers, such as "teachers are not considered cadres" being one example; an official from the Shanghai Municipal Housing Administration Bureau, when responding to an elementary school teacher requesting housing allocation, said, "Even if there are vacant houses, it won't be your turn as an elementary school teacher," is another example (as reported in the People's Daily). Here, we also have district and township cadres casually asking elementary school teachers to deliver meeting notices; calling elementary school teachers to cook meals for large meetings; suspending classes to pull elementary school teachers to help fill out forms, keeping them up for days and nights; even not allowing elementary school teachers to wear cadre uniforms has happened. Just take recent events. When the wage reform regulations were announced, some cadres couldn't help but be shocked and said, "The wage increase target for elementary school teachers reaches more than 30 percent, while cadres only get more than 10 percent, is that reasonable!" Those who say this may not understand the principle of "distribution according to work," and should have long known that elementary school teachers' wages have always been relatively low. Cadres sitting in offices, going on business trips, drafting official documents and summaries, is labor, very hard work; teachers standing on the platform, grading homework, preparing lessons, is labor, also very hard work; cadres must play a model role among the masses, and teachers must also teach by example, each with its own merits. The reason for being angered (or rather, dissatisfied) by the "more than 30 percent" is perhaps truly treating teachers as great water buffalo!

No wonder that every year when teacher colleges recruit students, applicants are not enthusiastic. Even after repeated mobilization by relevant departments, some people still seem unconvinced, and individual students even say things like, "I'd rather go home and herd cattle!" Students are taught by teachers. According to common sense, articles and morality always first praise the goodness of the teacher, but the apprentice hates the master's profession. Is the formation of this contradictory psychology in young people unrelated to the "social atmosphere" created by some people?

Our country has always valued education. Leaving aside other measures, just looking at the fact that the wage increase target for elementary school teachers reaches "more than 30 percent"... isn't it also a powerful correction to those who discriminate against the teaching profession? What's so surprising?

    读诗有感
    吴戈
    清人郑燮、即以书画知名的郑板桥先生早年曾作村塾老师，赋过一首打油诗云：
    “教书原来是下流，傍人门户度春秋，半饥半寒清闲客，无枷无锁自在囚，课繁子弟偏懒惰，功少东家结冤仇，从今改过神龛子，天地君亲大牯牛。”
    这真是说尽作教师的人的苍凉心境。在旧社会，讲究“学而优则仕”，而教书，是被看作读书人的末路的；不惟傍人门户度着时有冻馁之虞的岁月，在“课繁”和“功少”的问题上，其苦况也与旧日的新嫁娘相同，起来早了得罪丈夫，起来迟了得罪公婆。郑板桥主张改神龛子，以大牯牛代替师位，正在于控诉社会的不平，愤怒地鞭挞“上流”人，兼寓“舍己为人，凄苦自甘”之意，后人不察，说他老先生也瞧不起教书匠，非也。
    以牛来喻人的忠实勤苦，劳怨不辞，是有书可考的。古之君子每于受人之托时说道：“仆敢不效牛马以供驱驰”，名为自卑，实则自矜，表示勇于任事；鲁迅的诗：“俯首甘为孺子牛”等等，也可为板桥先生的“牛”作证。然而现在某些干部，虽不全都读过板桥的诗，确确实实还在把教师当“下流”人看待，有的已经由轻视这项职业发展到公开侮慢教师的地步了，如“教师不算干部”就是一例；上海市房管局的干部回答要求调配房屋的小学教师说：“房子就是有空也轮不着你们小学教师”，又是一例（见人民日报载）。我们这里还有区乡干部随便叫小学教师送开会通知；开大会叫小学教师造饭；停课拉小学教师帮填表格，熬几天几夜；甚至不准小学教师穿干部服的事都发生过。就举最近的事吧。工资改革条例公布，有些干部不禁大吃一惊说：“小学教师工资增长指标达百分之三十几，干部才百分之十几，像话么！”说这种话的人，未必不懂“按劳取酬”的原则，早也应该知道小学教师工资一向是偏低的。干部坐办公室、出差、草拟公文总结之类，是劳动，很辛苦；教师上讲台、改作业、备课，是劳动，也很辛苦；干部要在群众中起模范作用，老师教人，也要以身教，都是各有千秋的，其所以被“百分之三十几”所激怒（或者说不满），莫非真的拿教师当大牯牛用！
    难怪每年师范招生，报考者总不踊跃，虽经有关方面一再动员，还有人似通非通，个别学生竟还说出这种话来：“宁可回家放牛！”学生是先生教出来的，揆诸常理，文章道德，总先推崇先生的好，而徒弟却又憎恶师傅的职业，青年人此种矛盾心理的形成，难道和某些人所制造的“社会风气”无关？
    我们国家从来就是重视教育事业的，其他措施不谈，单就小学教师工资增长指标达“百分之三十几”这一点看，……又未尝不是对歧视教师职业的人的一种有力纠正，有什么值得大惊小怪？
