International Notes

    "International Etiquette"
    Recently, the United States Information Service suddenly mentioned the term "international etiquette" in a telegram. This is quite novel, because for many years, the United States has long abandoned "international etiquette" in international affairs.
    The USIS mentioned "international etiquette" this time not because it suddenly remembered the need to talk about "international etiquette," but for a purpose that was far from the point—attempting to use the recent incident of U.S. military aircraft intruding into China's East China coastal islands' airspace to create an absurd excuse to continue obstructing the restoration of China's legitimate seat in the United Nations.
    The USIS selected commentaries from three newspapers, including "The New York Times," from the extensive publicity in American newspapers about this incident, accusing China's serious protest to the United States regarding the U.S. aircraft's intrusion into its airspace as "arrogant," "insulting," and "contemptuous" of the United States. According to them, this violates the "basic etiquette that any country wishing to join the world family must possess." One newspaper even described the U.S. aircraft's flight into Chinese airspace, which both the U.S. State Department and the Department of Defense had effectively acknowledged, as operating in an area it had the "right to enter." They attempted to prove that it was not the United States that was creating tension by sending troops and aircraft thousands of miles away to occupy Chinese territory and invade Chinese airspace, but rather China, which was defending its own territory and airspace, that was "creating" tension.
    According to their view, sending aircraft to another country's territory in the dead of night to carry out nefarious activities is what is called understanding "international etiquette." Doesn't this vividly portray the brazen faces of these American propagandists who talk glibly about "etiquette"?
    In fact, some American newspapers had already made a conclusion regarding the merits of this aircraft incident. For example, an editorial in the American "Star" pointed out: "The important thing on our part is that we should not... disregard the airspace of Communist countries and provoke such actions." An editorial in "The Washington Post" also acknowledged: "If the plane did intrude into Communist territory before being attacked over the high seas, there is no reason to protest." Obviously, the people who planned this unreasonable provocation incident had no way to explain it to the American people, so they had to brazenly act like hooligans, lodging so-called "protests" to China, demanding "compensation," and even irrelevantly involving the issue of "international etiquette" and China's seat in the United Nations. This incident is another good mirror, reflecting the faces and hearts of these people: they do not hesitate to use all means and seize every opportunity to create propaganda hostile to China and maintain their hopeless policy of obstructing China's entry into the United Nations. To this end, they do not hesitate to use the lives of American pilots as bloody capital for provoking China and carrying out rogue propaganda.

### “国际礼节”

专栏：国际札记

    “国际礼节”
    最近，美国新闻处在一则电讯中忽然提及了“国际礼节”这个字眼。这件事倒颇为新鲜，因为多少年来，美国在国际事务中早就把“国际礼节”这回事丢在脑后了的。
    美国新闻处这回谈到“国际礼节”，并不是因为它忽然记起了有讲讲“国际礼节”的必要，而是为了一个离题万里的目的——企图假借最近美国军用飞机侵犯我国华东沿海岛屿领空的事件，制造出一种继续阻挠恢复中国在联合国的合法席位的荒唐口实。
    美国新闻处从美国报纸对这一事件的大量宣传中挑选出“纽约时报”等三家报纸的评论，指责中国就美国飞机侵犯我领空向美国提出的严重抗议是“傲慢”的，是“侮辱”和“轻蔑”了美国。据它们说，这是违反了“凡愿参加世界大家庭的任何国家都必须具备的基本礼节”。其中一家报纸甚至把美国国务院和国防部都在事实上承认了的美国飞机侵入中国领空的飞行，说成是它在有“权进入的地区进行活动”。它们企图证明“不是派遣军队和飞机在万里之外侵占中国领土和侵犯中国领空的美国在制造紧张局势，而倒是保卫自己的领土领空的中国“造成了”紧张局势。
    照它们的意见，半夜三更派遣飞机到别国领土进行不可告人的活动这就叫做懂得“国际礼节”。这不是活画出了这批高谈“礼节”的美国宣传家的一副耍无赖的厚脸孔了吗？
    其实，这次飞机事件的是非曲直，是某些美国报纸也早就作了定论的。例如，美国“明星报”的社论就曾指出：“在我们这方面重要的是，不应该……不顾共产党国家的领空而惹起这种行动。”“华盛顿邮报”的社论也承认：“如果飞机在公海上空遭到攻击之前确实侵入了共产党领土的话，是没有理由提出抗议的”。显然，策划这种无理挑衅事件的人们没有办法向美国人民作出交代，因此，他们只好硬起头皮耍无赖，向中国提所谓“抗议”，要“赔偿”，甚至牛头不对马嘴地牵扯到什么“国际礼节”和中国在联合国席位的问题上去。这个事件倒是又一面很好的镜子，照出了这些人的面目和心肝：他们不惜使用一切手段和利用一切机会来制造敌视中国的宣传和维持他们的阻碍中国进入联合国的前途绝望的政策。为了这个目的，他们不惜拿美国飞行员的生命，当做向中国挑衅和进行无赖宣传的血腥的本钱。
