Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, August 31st. "Dedicate our remaining years to fighting resolutely against wars of aggression and striving for lasting peace. Long live the eternal friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people!" These are the words written on a silk banner presented to the Tianjin branch of the Chinese Red Cross Society by the third group of released Japanese war criminals at a farewell ceremony held last night. All three hundred and fifty-four released Japanese war criminals signed the banner. They also presented silk banners to the Supreme People's Procuratorate of the People's Republic of China, and the Fushun and Taiyuan War Criminals Management Offices.

Kiichi Miwa, representing all the released Japanese war criminals, read a "Farewell and Gratitude Statement," saying, "The Chinese people not only saved our lives but also guided us onto the path of peace. This is a kindness that we will never forget for the rest of our lives." Wu Shifa, Director-General of the Tianjin branch of the Chinese Red Cross Society, said in his speech that he hoped they would work for peace and wished them a safe journey home.

Before the farewell ceremony, the released Japanese war criminals and the Japanese expatriates about to return home held a social gathering with the staff of the Tianjin branch of the Chinese Red Cross Society. The released Japanese war criminals performed more than ten choruses, as well as Chinese and Japanese folk dances. Suzuki Shichiro, a 61-year-old Japanese expatriate who had lived in China for seventeen years, spontaneously went on stage to sing a Japanese folk song. He told Xinhua News Agency reporters, "As a Japanese, I cannot but be grateful to the Chinese people for their lenient treatment of Japanese war criminals. After we return to our country, we will definitely unite and work hard for world peace and Sino-Japanese friendship."

    日本战争犯罪分子向我红十字会告别
    新华社天津31日电　“贡献后半生为坚决反对侵略战争，争取持久和平而斗争，中日两国人民的永远的友谊万岁”。这是第三批被释放的日本战争犯罪分子在昨晚举行的向中国红十字会告别仪式上，献给中国红十字会天津分会的一面锦旗上写的词句。被释放的三百五十四名日本战争犯罪分子都在这面锦旗上签了名，他们还分送给中华人民共和国最高人民检察院、抚顺和太原战犯管理所锦旗各一面。
    三轮敬一代表全体被释放的日本战争犯罪分子宣读“告别感谢文”说：“中国人民不但救了我们的生命，而且引导我们走上和平的道路，这是我们对中国人民一辈子也忘不了的恩德。”中国红十字会天津分会总干事吴士法在致词中希望他们为和平而努力，并祝贺他们在归途中一路平安。
    在举行告别仪式之前，被释放的日本战争犯罪分子和即将回国的日侨同中国红十字会天津分会的工作人员举行了联欢晚会。被释放的日本战争犯罪分子在会上演出了十多个合唱，及中国和日本民间舞蹈等节目。在中国住了十七年的六十一岁的日侨铃木七郎自动地上台唱了一支日本民歌。他对新华社记者说：“作为一个日本人，不能不感谢中国人民对日本战争犯罪分子的宽大处理。我们回国后一定团结起来为世界和平和中日友好而努力。”
