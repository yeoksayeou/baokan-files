Why is Remuneration for Sideline Labor Low?
    Hui Zhi

    Currently, many agricultural producer cooperatives have the phenomenon of low remuneration for sideline labor. There are many ways to suppress sideline labor remuneration in various places, which can be summarized into the following:

    Depressing work points. For example, in the Gutian Agricultural Cooperative in Yudu, Jiangxi, the base work points for bamboo weavers in the cooperative are rated as three levels. First-class bamboo weavers earn eight work points for a day's work in the cooperative, while third-class weavers only earn six work points, which is equivalent to the remuneration of a semi-laborer engaged in agricultural production. In the first cooperative of Zhang Tao Township in Xinyang, Henan, thirty-six able-bodied laborers processing rice earned an average of five and a half work points per person per day, while a thirteen-year-old child earned six and seven work points for cutting grass in a day.

    Increasing quotas. For example, in the second cooperative of the Liangshui Jingwoxi area in Yuanling County, Hunan, the quota for making pottery blanks is twenty-two sets per day, but in reality, only seventeen or eighteen sets can be made.

    More in, less out. For example, in the Seventh Cooperative of Qianjin, Macheng County, Hubei, members who earn one yuan from sideline occupations and turn it over to the cooperative only receive two jiao and six fen during the summer pre-distribution.

    Raising costs. For example, the bamboo in the Jishe Agricultural Cooperative in Zunyi County, Guizhou, originally sold to members for two jiao per pole. When members engaged in more sideline occupations, it immediately rose to four jiao, making it unprofitable for members.

    Agricultural cooperatives with these biases have not completed their sideline production plans well, and members' enthusiasm for production is not high. They reflect: "There is nothing but pot crust, no rice." What's the point of doing it?

    Even so, those who advocate reducing sideline remuneration still seem confident and have their reasons. Some say: Sideline work is light and easy, you don't get hit by the wind or rain. Who can't do it? The remuneration should be lower. Obviously, this reason is untenable. There are quite a few heavy jobs in sideline production, such as carpentry, stonework, ironwork, pushing carts, and oil pressing. Some light work also requires certain skills to do, and not everyone can do it. To learn these skills, you need to spend a lot of learning time in advance.

    When evaluating sideline labor remuneration, if you do not comprehensively consider the labor intensity and technical complexity, and appropriately take care of heavy work, technical work, and complex work, who will be willing to participate in these sideline production activities? Who will be willing to learn techniques?

    The sideline remuneration of the First Cooperative of Yangjia Township in Deyang County, Sichuan, is more reasonable. Those who have physical work and need certain skills (driving mule carts, managing kilns, grinding oilseeds, etc.) are recorded as 1.1 or 1.2 labor days per day; those who spend labor but do not require technology (carrying brick blanks, etc.) or require technology but are not too strenuous (castrating chickens, etc.) are roughly equivalent to the remuneration of general farm work, and are recorded as 0.8 or 1 labor days per day. In this way, members are equally willing to do both agricultural and sideline work, and everyone's enthusiasm for learning technology is encouraged.

    Some people are afraid that more members engaged in sideline occupations will affect agricultural production, so they deliberately use the method of reducing sideline labor remuneration to restrict members from participating in sideline production. In fact, this is a very passive approach. They don't have a clear understanding of the labor force required for agriculture, or the labor force planning is improper, leading to a false "tension," so they are hesitant to move. As long as the situation is clear, the agricultural and sideline industries are unified, the labor force is uniformly allocated, more efforts are used in agriculture during busy farming seasons, more sideline occupations are engaged in during slack farming seasons, and non-seasonal sideline occupations are mostly engaged in during slack farming seasons. This will not only develop sideline occupations but also will not affect agriculture.

    Sideline income accounts for a large proportion of farmers' total income. Fully utilizing labor resources and natural resources, and vigorously developing diversified operations, are the most effective ways to increase production, increase income, and improve people's lives. Those who despise and restrict sideline production, and suppress sideline labor remuneration, if they truly understand the income situation of farmers and understand this fundamental principle, they will immediately feel that the views they hold and the measures they take should have been thrown into the Eastern Ocean long ago.

    副业劳动报酬为何偏低
    慧之
    目前有许多农业生产合作社存在副业劳动报酬偏低的现象。各地压低副业劳动报酬的办法很多，总括起来约有以下几种：
    压低工分。如江西雩都古田农业社，把社内篾工的底分评为三等，一等篾工在社内做工一天记八分，三等的只记六分，相当于一个从事农业生产的半劳动力的报酬。河南信阳张陶乡第一社，加工稻谷的三十六个整劳动力，平均每人每天五分半，而一个十三岁的小孩割草一天还得了六分七。
    提高定额。如湖南沅陵县凉水井窝溪片第二社，作陶器坯子的定额是每天二十二套，实际只能作十七、八套。
    进多出少。如湖北麻城县前进第七社，社员搞副业挣来的钱交社一元，夏季预分中只分到二角六分。
    抬高成本。如贵州遵义县集社农业社的竹子，原来卖给社员是二角一根，社员搞副业多了，马上涨到四角，使社员无利可得。
    凡有这些偏向的农业社，副业生产计划都完成得不好，社员生产情绪不高，他们反映：“除了锅巴没有饭”，这还有什么搞头？
    虽然如此，主张降低副业报酬的人们却还像理直气壮似的，振振有词。有人说：副业是轻快活，风不打头，雨不打脸，谁不能干？报酬应当低些。很明显，这种理由是站不住脚的。副业生产中的繁重活如木、石、铁工，推车，榨油等，并不在少数。有些轻活，做起来也要有一定的技术，并不是任何人都能做的，要学会这些技术，是要预先付出许多学习时间的。
    在评定副业劳动报酬的时候，如果不全面地从劳动轻重和技术繁简程度考虑，适当照顾重活、技术活、复杂活，谁还乐意参加这些副业生产呢？谁还愿意学习技术呢？
    四川德阳县杨嘉乡第一社的副业报酬就规定得比较合理。凡费力和需要一定技术的活（赶骡车、掌窑、磨油坯等）每天记一点一或者一点二个劳动日；花费劳力但不要技术（担砖坯等）或者需要技术但不太费力（阉鸡等）的活，大体相当于一般农活的报酬，每天记零点八或者一个劳动日。这样社员对农副业同样愿意做，并且鼓励了大家学习技术的积极性。
    有些人怕搞副业的社员多了会影响农业生产，因而故意用降低副业劳动报酬的办法来限制社员参加副业生产。其实这是非常消极的办法。他们心中无数，对农业需要的劳动力不摸底，或者劳力规划不当，促成虚假“紧张”，因而缩手缩脚不敢动一动。只要摸清底细，把农副业统一安排，劳动力统一调配，农忙时多用些力量在农业上，农闲时多搞些副业，没有季节性的副业多在农闲时搞。这样既开展了副业，又不会影响到农业。
    副业收入，在农民全部收入中占有很大的比重。充分利用劳力资源和自然资源，大力开展多种经营，是增加生产、增加收入、提高人民生活的最有效的办法。轻视和限制副业生产，压低副业劳动报酬的人们，如果真正深入了解农民的收入情况，弄清这个根本道理，就会立刻感到自己所持的见解和所采取的措施，都是早就该抛之东洋大海的了。
