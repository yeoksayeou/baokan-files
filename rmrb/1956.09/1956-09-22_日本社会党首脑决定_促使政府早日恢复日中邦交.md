Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 21st – News: Leaders of the Japanese Socialist Party decided today to actively launch a national movement to urge the Japanese government to restore diplomatic relations with China at an early date.

　　Chairman Suzuki of the Socialist Party, Director of the International Bureau Sata, Chairman of the Policy Deliberation Council Ito, and ten other senior cadres decided to actively promote the policy previously decided by the Central Executive Committee to conclude a comprehensive treaty on the restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations. They unanimously agreed that the Japanese government should be required to promptly begin negotiations with China to conclude a comprehensive treaty on the restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations.

　　The Socialist Party leaders also decided that, as a preliminary measure for the restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations, the Japanese government should immediately try to lift the embargo restrictions on China and conclude a Sino-Japanese trade agreement. They requested the Japanese government to implement the following measures to expand Sino-Japanese trade: establish trade delegations in each other's countries, and grant government official status to the delegation members; Sino-Japanese foreign exchange banks should conclude foreign exchange agency contracts, and the government should guarantee their implementation; and hold long-term commodity exhibitions. The Socialist Party leaders also demanded that the Japanese government abolish exit and other improper restrictions, normalize exchanges between the peoples of China and Japan, and enhance friendly relations between the two countries.

　　The above-mentioned method for restoring Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations decided by the leaders of the Japanese Socialist Party will be finalized at the meeting of the Central Executive Committee of the Socialist Party on the 27th.

    日本社会党首脑决定
    促使政府早日恢复日中邦交
    新华社21日讯　东京消息：日本社会党首脑们今天决定积极展开国民运动，促使日本政府早日同中国恢复邦交。
    社会党委员长铃木、国际局长佐多、政策审议会会长伊藤等十个高级干部决定要积极推行中央执行委员会以前决定的缔结关于恢复日中邦交的全面条约的方针。他们一致认为，应该要求日本政府迅速地同中国开始举行谈判，以缔结恢复日中邦交的全面条约。
    社会党首脑们还决定，作为恢复日中邦交的预备措施，日本政府应该立即设法撤销对中国的禁运限制，缔结日中贸易协定。他们要求日本政府实现下列扩大日中贸易的措施：互设贸易代表团，并给代表团人员以政府官员的待遇；中日两国外汇银行订立代办外汇的合同，并由政府保证其实行；举行长期性的商品展览会。社会党首脑们并且要求日本政府废除出国和其他不正当的限制，使日中两国人民的来往正常化，以增进日中两国的友好关系。
    日本社会党首脑决定的上述恢复日中邦交的办法，将在27日举行的社会党中央执行委员会会议上作出最后的决定。
