Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, September 5th: As of today, twenty-nine Shanghai seamen with rich navigational experience have applied to work in the Egyptian Suez Canal.

Dai Liren, the captain of the coastal freighter "Zhongxing No. 1", who has sailed on ocean routes for many years, said in his application: "I used to sail through the Suez Canal often, and I am very willing to work there." Shi Junpei, a first-class pilot at the Port of Shanghai, submitted his application on the same day that the advertisement for recruiting Suez Canal pilots was published. He said: "I have more than twenty years of navigational experience, and I think it is possible for me to work in the Suez Canal."

Old seamen in Shanghai's shipping circles, such as Jin Yueshi and Huang Yajun, are nearly sixty years old and no longer meet the application requirements. They said to those who applied, you support the Egyptian people, and we will take on the work you leave behind.

    我海员申请去苏彝士运河工作
    新华社上海5日电　到今天止，上海已经有二十九名具有丰富航海经验的海员申请前往埃及苏彝士运河工作。
    曾经在远洋航线上航行多年、现在是沿海货轮“中兴一号”的船长戴立人，在提出申请书时说：“我过去常常航行经过苏彝士运河，我很乐意到那里去工作”。上海港一级领航员施俊培，在关于招聘苏彝士运河领航员的广告见报的当天，就提出申请。他说：“我有二十多年的航海经验，我想到苏彝士运河去工作是可以的。”
    上海航海界的老前辈金月石和黄亚君等年龄都已经近六十岁，已不符合应聘条件。他们向申请应聘的人说，你们支援埃及人民，留下的工作由我们担当起来。
