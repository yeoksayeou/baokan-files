Xinhua News Agency dispatch:

The Ministry of Education recently convened the presidents, provosts, and research department directors of Beijing Normal University, East China Normal University, and Northeast Normal University for a symposium on graduate student training.

The symposium considered that these three higher normal universities bear a particularly important task in training and improving the faculty of higher normal schools. In recent years, these three universities have achieved certain results and experience in running the two-year graduate programs. This year, excluding a few other normal colleges, the number of two-year graduate students at these three universities alone will be nearly one thousand, and will exceed one thousand including those taking short-term individual advanced studies.

Everyone agreed that schools with training tasks should place graduate student training in an important position and improve and strengthen work in all aspects, including organizational leadership, teacher allocation, library materials, instruments and equipment, learning environment, and living conditions, to ensure the quality of graduate students. To meet the needs of faculty in the development of higher normal education, two-year graduate programs should continue to be held for the next few years.

The meeting exchanged views on the issue of training associate doctoral candidates. Everyone believed that the strength of Chinese experts in national higher normal schools should be fully utilized to train a certain number of associate doctoral candidates in certain specialties for the country. Each school should actively prepare for the admission of associate doctoral candidates next year. Everyone agreed that although there are institutional differences between the training of associate doctoral candidates and the current two-year graduate programs, they are not unrelated. In the future, a few outstanding students from the current two-year graduate students will be absorbed as associate doctoral candidates. At the same time, the enrollment targets for associate doctoral candidates in the higher normal system should widely absorb graduates from higher normal schools or general universities, teaching assistants, outstanding middle school teachers, and education agency cadres with excellent academic performance to participate in the examination.

In addition to instructing these three higher normal universities to actively carry out preparations for the admission of associate doctoral candidates next year, the Ministry of Education also stated at the meeting that it will organize some Chinese experts from other higher normal schools to recruit a certain number of associate doctoral candidates in certain specialties.

    教育部召集三所高等师范大学校长等
    座谈加强培养研究生工作
    新华社讯　教育部最近召集北京、华东、东北师范大学校长、教务长、研究部主任等座谈研究生培养工作。
    座谈会认为，这三所高等师范学校在培养提高高等师范学校师资工作中负有特别重要的任务。几年来，这三校在办理二年制研究生班的工作中，取得了一定的成绩和经验。今年，除其它少数师范学院外，仅这三校的二年制研究生在校人数将近千人，连同短期个别进修的在内将在千人以上。
    大家认为，有培养任务的学校应把培养研究生的工作放到重要的地位，从组织领导、教师配备、图书资料、仪器设备、学习环境以及生活条件等各方面改进和加强工作，以保证研究生的质量。为适应高等师范教育发展中师资的需要，在今后若干年内，二年制研究生班仍应继续举办。
    会上就培养副博士研究生问题交换了意见。大家认为应充分发挥全国高等师范学校中国专家的力量，为国家培养一定专业一定数量的副博士研究生。各校应积极为明年招收副博士研究生作好准备工作。大家认为，培养副博士研究生和目前二年制的研究生班，虽然在制度上有差别，但不是没有联系的。目前二年制的研究生中将来必有少数成绩优秀的人，可吸收为副博士研究生。同时，高等师范系统副博士研究生的招生对象，应该广泛地吸收学业成绩优异的高等师范学校或一般大学毕业生、助教、优秀中学教员、教育机关干部等参加考试。
    教育部在会上除了责成这三所高等师范学校积极进行有关明年招收副博士研究生的准备工作外，并表示将另外再组织部分高等师范学校的中国专家招收一定专业、一定数量的副博士研究生。
