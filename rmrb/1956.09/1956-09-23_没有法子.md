Title: "There's No Other Way"

    "Who doesn't know that coercion and commandism are bad? But sometimes there's really no other way." This is a common argument heard among some cadres (mainly at the grassroots level). I have not only heard this argument but also witnessed this "really no other way" scenario. The location was a village on the north bank of the Huai River, and the time was the spring shortly after land reform was completed in this area.

    The new year's Huai River management project was about to begin, and some cadres thought selecting laborers would be easy. A mobilization meeting, a few calls to action, and a democratic assessment to decide who should go and who shouldn't – wouldn't that be the end of it? Last year everyone was scrambling to go to the Huai River, let alone today, when land reform has been completed and the farmers' political awareness has been greatly enhanced!

    But when the day for assembling the laborers designated by the higher authorities arrived, the "scrambling" phenomenon of the previous year did not appear in this village. A few people even pretended to have headaches and foot pain. One person was just "persuaded" to come out of his house, and another went back home. The district and township cadres, sweating profusely from running around, felt there was "really no other way" and resorted to coercion and commandism: "Is this democracy? This is forgetting your roots, sabotage! If we say you go, you have to go, no ifs, ands, or buts…!" So a few who didn't want to go went reluctantly.

    Look, for these few people, besides coercion and commandism, was there any other "way"?

    To answer this question, we must first analyze the specific situation. At this time last year, everyone had no land to till and no food to eat. Participating in Huai River management not only meant they could eat their fill but also bring their surplus grain back home to support their families. This was an important reason for their "scrambling." This year, however, they had been allocated the landlords' land, farm tools, and surplus grain, and everyone wanted to engage in production at home. You say there are mutual aid teams to cultivate for them? But the mutual aid teams have not yet been organized, and they can't be trusted. Moreover, "political awareness" has indeed increased. If they don't want to go, they don't want to go. Can the cadres tie them up? Hence the "sabotage" situation occurred.

    If the cadres had investigated and researched the actual situation earlier, first grasped the time to organize the mutual aid teams well, and arranged the laborers' production work properly, giving them no "worries," coupled with "political awareness," they might not have pretended to have headaches and foot pain. If the higher-level leading organs, in addition to issuing "assembly" orders, had understood the situation below beforehand and given the district and township cadres some specific guidance, it might not have been impossible to avoid the "really no other way" situation.

    To mobilize the people to do things for their own benefit, there will never be no "way" other than "coercion and commandism." The reason why there is "really no other way" boils down to not frequently going deep to understand the actual situation of the masses, relying only on old "ways," and not thinking of new "ways." What is most harmful is the belief that "coercion and commandism" are useful in some situations. Didn't the few laborers who were ordered to go sneak back from halfway? That's what is truly called "really no other way"!

### “没有法子”

    “没有法子”
    应必正
    “谁不知道强迫命令不好呢？不过有时实在没有法子。”这是在一些干部（主要是基层干部）中时常可以听到的论调。我不但听到过这种论调，而且看到过这种“实在没有法子”的场面。地点是淮河北岸的一个庄子，时间是这一带地方完成了土地改革不久的春天。
    新年度的治淮工程要开工了，有些干部认为选派民工轻而易举。一个动员会，几声号召，通过民主评议决定谁该去，谁不该去，那不是完了？上年大家尚且争先恐后地上淮河，何况完成了土地改革、大大提高了农民的政治觉悟的今天！
    可是到了上级指定的集合民工的日子，这个庄子里并没有出现像上年那样“争先恐后”的现象，少数人甚至装头痛、脚痛。这个刚从家里被“说服”出来，那个又回到家里去了。奔走得满头大汗的区乡干部们“实在没有法子”，只好强迫命令了：“这是民主吗？这是忘本，捣蛋！说去就得去，不去不行……！”于是几个不愿意去的，也勉强去了。
    你瞧，对这几个人来说，除了强迫命令，难道还有别的“法子”吗？
    要解答这个问题，先得分析一下具体情况。上年此时此地，大家没有地种，没有饭吃；参加治淮，非但本人吃得饱饱的，还可以把自己的余粮带回去养家口。这是“争先恐后”的重要原因。今年呢，分到了地主们的土地、农具、余粮，都想在家里搞生产。你说有互助组替他们耕种吗？但互助组还没有组织起来，相信不得。而且“政治觉悟”确实提高了，不去就不去，干部难道能够绑他们吗？于是乎发生“捣蛋”的情况。
    如果干部们早就调查研究了实际情况，首先抓紧时间组织好互助组，把民工们的生产工作安排得好好的，使无“后顾之忧”，再加上“政治觉悟”，他们就未必会装头痛脚痛了。如果上级领导机关除发布“集合”命令外，事前了解一下下情，给区乡干部一些具体指点，也未必不能避免“实在没有法子”的局面。
    要动员人民去做人民自己的事，决不会没有“强迫命令”以外的“法子”的。其所以“实在没有法子”，归根结底，都是因为不经常深入了解群众实际情况，只靠老“法子”，不想新“法子”。最有害的是认为“强迫命令”在某种情况下也有用处。上面说的几个被命令走的民工，不是从半路偷偷溜回来了吗？这才真正叫做“实在没有法子”！
