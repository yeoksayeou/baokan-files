The Drought Resistance Struggle of the People of Hunan
By our reporter Huang Yubai

Just as the farmers of Hunan overcame floods, insect pests, and wind disasters, and won a bumper harvest of 15 million mu of early rice, the middle rice and dryland crops in some areas were again seriously threatened by drought.

At the end of June, the drought-affected area in the province was 4 million mu, which developed to 9 million mu by the end of July, and reached 10 million mu by early August. There are about 30 counties in the province with relatively serious drought conditions, and only the lakeside plains and the upper reaches of the Lishui River are less affected. In some places, such as Wugang and Mayang counties, the drought-affected area has reached more than 70% of the total cultivated land in the county. More than 90% of the townships and agricultural cooperatives in the entire Shaoyang Special Zone have suffered from drought. Some older farmers in the Shaoyang Special Zone reflected: "This year's drought is even worse than the Xinmao year (1915)."

Zhong Shi, Secretary of the Shaoyang Prefectural Committee, made the following analysis of the drought situation in the Shaoyang area: First, this year's drought came early, lasted long, and affected a wide area. Wugang, Dongkou, and other counties have had no rain for sixty to seventy days. Second, more than 40,000 mu of rain-fed land, more than 1 million mu of terraced fields, and some spring-sown fields in the entire special zone are prone to drought due to their low water storage capacity. In addition, some places in Xinning and other counties have reclaimed wasteland and felled trees, resulting in barren mountains and serious soil erosion, and even streams that have never dried up before have dried up. Third, in the beginning, the leadership was ideologically paralyzed and underestimated the rainfall this year. When signs of drought appeared, the agricultural bureau blindly promoted frequent and shallow irrigation, but because the fields stored little water, they could not withstand the drought. Fourth, after the collectivization, some places had not had time to reorganize their water management organizations, and when the drought came, some agricultural cooperatives were caught off guard.

In fact, this is not just the situation in Shaoyang Special Zone; the drought situation in other special zones is similar.

The drought has brought a series of problems. The original production plans of the agricultural cooperatives have been disrupted, and the distribution plans have fallen through. According to preliminary statistics from the Shaoyang Special Zone, more than half of the agricultural cooperatives in the area will have varying degrees of reduced production. According to estimates from Shaodong County in this special zone, agricultural cooperatives with a 50% reduction in production will have a labor day value of only 1 to 2 jiao, and the average is only about 3 or 4 jiao. Because most of the labor force is concentrated on drought resistance, other sideline production has also been adversely affected. Some rivers are dry and shallow, logs cannot be floated, and shipping has also been suspended.

The farmers who have realized cooperation have fought the drought with the greatest efforts. At the height of the drought, statistics from only Shaoyang, Qianyang, Hengyang, and Chenxian Special Zones in the province showed that more than 4 million farmers were engaged in drought resistance activities every day. Various places have universally promoted the method of "overall planning and joint drought resistance." First, irrigation areas are divided by project, based on water volume, watershed, and water use rights, and then mutual adjustments and mutual support are carried out through democratic consultation. According to statistics from 54 townships in Shaodong County, Shaoyang Special Zone, more than 30,000 cooperatives and more than 10,000 individual households were united, more than 1,600 drought resistance units were organized, and more than 4,000 water sources were adjusted, irrigating more than 300,000 mu of rice fields. In the drought resistance efforts, Shaodong County proposed the principles of using water to irrigate fields in the order of saving the living first, then the dead, downstream first, then upstream, nearby first, then distant, and middle rice first, then late rice, making water use more rational and effective.

With the development of the drought, the leadership timely called on farmers to carry out crop replacement and emergency planting. From the county to the township to the cooperative, production plans began to be revised level by level, focusing on planning this year's autumn and winter production. Disaster areas were required to cultivate late rice and existing dryland crops well, actively expand autumn planting, strive for increased late autumn production, and vigorously develop diversified operations and sideline businesses. Statistics from Changde, Shaoyang, and other five special zones show that the planned autumn planting area this year has been expanded to 21 million mu, an increase of more than 8 million mu compared with last year. Many achievements have also been made in diversified operations. More than 6,000 people in the Huitong forest area of Qianyang Special Zone are transporting timber, with an average daily income of 700 to 800 yuan.

The drought resistance, production, and disaster relief work in drought-affected areas have also received strong support from various departments. The Shaoyang Special Zone alone has newly manufactured 10,000 waterwheels, the grain department has supplemented the sale of 15 million jin of grain, 5.3 million yuan has been invested for the purchase of local specialties, banks have issued more than 4 million yuan in living loans, and civil affairs departments and health departments have vigorously provided support.

Since August 20, it has rained successively in various places along the Yuan River, Zi River, and Xiang River, and the drought has been alleviated to some extent. In some places, the disaster situation has stopped developing. Now the farmers' self-rescue through production in the disaster areas is developing in depth and breadth.

    湖南人民的抗旱斗争
    本报记者　黄驭白
    正当湖南农民战胜了水、虫、风灾，赢得了一千五百万亩早稻丰收的时候，部分地区的中稻和旱土作物又受到了干旱的严重威胁。
    6月底，全省受旱面积是四百万亩，7月底就发展到九百万亩，到8月上旬就达到一千万亩。全省旱情比较严重的约有三十个县，只有滨湖平原和澧水上游受旱较轻。有的地方如武岗、麻阳等县受旱面积已达到占全县总田亩的70％以上。整个邵阳专区就有90％以上的乡和农业社遭受到干旱的危害。邵阳专区有些年岁较老的农民都反映：“今年的干旱比辛卯年（1915年）还厉害。”
    邵阳地委书记钟石同志曾经对邵阳地区的受旱情况作过如下的分析：一、今年旱的早，旱的久，旱的面积宽。武岗、洞口等县已经有六十到七十天断雨。二、全专区四万多亩天水田，一百多万亩坎田和部分小春田，因为蓄水力低，历年容易受旱。加上新宁等县有的地方开荒伐木，童山濯濯，水土冲刷严重，连从来没有干过的溪涧也枯底了。三、开始的时候，领导思想麻痹，对今年雨情估计不足。在旱象露头时，农业局还盲目推行勤灌浅灌，由于田地蓄水少，所以就经不起旱。四、合作化以后，有的地方管水组织还没来得及整理，干旱一来，有的农业社就手忙脚乱。
    其实，这不仅是邵阳一个专区的情况，其他专区的旱灾情况，也和这个专区差不多。
    旱灾带来了一系列的问题。农业社原来的生产计划被打乱了，分配方案落空了。据邵阳专区的初步统计，全区有一半以上的农业社要程度不同地减产。据这个专区的邵东县估计，减产一半的农业社，每个劳动日的工值只有一角至二角钱，一般的也只有三、四角左右。由于把绝大部分劳动力集中在抗旱上面，别的副业生产也受到不良影响。有的河干水浅，木排放不下，船运也停滞了。
      实现了合作化的农民，用最大的努力同干旱进行了搏斗。在干旱最严重的时候，全省仅邵阳、黔阳、衡阳、郴县几个专区的统计，每天就有四百万以上的农民从事抗旱活动。各地普遍推行“全面规划，联合抗旱”的方法。首先以工程为单位，根据水量、流域、用水权益划分灌溉区，然后通过民主协商，互相调剂、互相支援。据邵阳专区邵东县五十四个乡的统计，就联合了三万多个社和一万多个单干户，组织了一千六百多个抗旱单位，调剂了四千多处水源，灌溉了三十多万亩稻田，在抗旱中，邵东县提出了先活后死，先下后上，先近后远，先中后晚的用水灌田原则，使用水更加合理有效。
    随着旱情的发展，领导上及时号召农民进行改种、抢种。从县到乡到社，开始逐级修订生产计划，着重规划了今年的秋冬生产。要求灾区培育好晚稻和现有旱田作物，积极扩大秋种，争取晚秋增产，并大力开展多种经营、多搞副业。常德、邵阳等五个专区统计：今年秋种面积计划扩大到二千一百万亩，比去年增加八百多万亩。在多种经营方面也做出不少成绩，黔阳专区的会同林区即有六千多人在流送木材，平均每天可以收入七、八百元。
    受旱地区的抗旱、生产、救灾工作，还得到各个部门的大力支援。仅邵阳专区就新制水车一万部，粮食部门补销粮一千五百万斤，为收购土特产品投放了五百三十万元，银行发放生活贷款四百多万元，民政部门、卫生部门都大力进行了支援。
    八月二十日以来，沅水、资水、湘水各地都相继下雨，旱灾有所减轻，有的地方灾情已经停止发展。现在灾区农民的生产自救，正在深入广泛地向前发展。
