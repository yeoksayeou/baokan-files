    Seize the Time to Prepare for Autumn Planting and Autumn Cultivation
    Reasonably Arrange the Area for Autumn Sowing
    (Our Newspaper) The Songjiang Special District of Jiangsu Province is closely integrating with current production and actively carrying out preparations for autumn sowing.
    How to determine the area for autumn crops this year? It involves the intersection of two crops every four years and two crops every five years, the arrangement of double-cropping rice and rice-wheat rotation, the combination of food crops and cash crops, and also involves how to solve various specific problems such as fertilizer, seeds, and labor. Therefore, the CPC Songjiang District Committee led various counties to study and formulate autumn sowing plans as early as mid-August. Later, the District Committee found that the area for rapeseed planting proposed by various counties was 120,000 mu less than the national plan, and the arrangement of double-cropping rice and rice-wheat rotation was not entirely reasonable. The Songjiang District Committee requested that when formulating autumn sowing area plans, various counties should consider both output and output value under the premise of obeying the national plan, and also consider practical possibilities. The rapeseed planting area cannot be reduced, but various counties can make adjustments within the county; the wheat area can be appropriately expanded, but the green manure area cannot be reduced as a result; the cotton area in low-yield cotton areas can be appropriately reduced. According to the instructions of the District Committee, various counties have revised their autumn sowing plans. Now, discussions and revisions are being carried out from bottom to top. Qingpu County has decided to transfer the rapeseed production tasks in areas with low rapeseed yields to high-yield areas, which will ensure that the rapeseed area is not reduced and the unit yield can be increased. Songjiang, Qingpu, Jinshan and other late rice areas have achieved bumper harvests of wheat this year, and it has been preliminarily decided to expand the wheat fields by more than 200,000 mu.
    At the same time, various counties have also actively carried out technical and material preparations for autumn sowing. Qingpu County held a summer harvest bumper harvest experience exchange meeting on August 24, attended by more than 500 township and commune cadres and bumper harvest representatives, summarizing the summer bumper harvest experience. Jianxin, Minjian and other seven agricultural cooperatives in Beisha Township, Caojing District, Songjiang County, launched a fertilizer accumulation campaign to prepare autumn sowing fertilizer in advance. Various counties generally lack green manure seeds, and the district and county leading organs have sent cadres to Zhejiang, northern Jiangsu and other places to purchase them. The current lack of green manure seeds is still a prominent problem in various counties in the Songjiang area, which needs to be resolved as soon as possible. (Fan Wanjun)
  Check Machinery and Prepare to Go to the Fields
    (Our Newspaper) Fourteen tractor stations in Shaanxi Province are actively preparing for autumn sowing. The ten newly built stations this year will go to the fields for the first time to serve various agricultural cooperatives. The autumn sowing mechanized farming area in the province will expand from ten counties and cities in the first half of the year to twenty-three counties and cities. It is estimated that the autumn sowing area will reach more than 190,000 mu, an increase of eleven times compared with last year; the winter plowing area will be more than 510,000 mu, an increase of more than six times compared with last year. Tractor plowing will appear for the first time in the Hanzhong Basin and the fields near Yan'an, the holy land of the revolution.
    So far, the province has 178 tractors of various types, and 24-row, 28-row, and 48-row grain drills suitable for different soil types and sowing densities.
    The staff of various tractor stations are preparing to launch a large-scale labor competition in autumn sowing.
  Hubei Transfers a Large Batch of Wheat Seeds
    (Our Newspaper) In order to support farmers in the disaster areas of Anhui and Jiangsu provinces to quickly restore production, and to promote improved varieties in Jiangxi and Henan provinces, Hubei Province transferred more than 90 million jin of wheat and barley seeds. Among them, the Nanda 2419 improved variety was transferred to Henan, Jiangxi and Jiangsu provinces; more than 20 million jin of improved varieties were also transferred to Anhui Province.
    In order to supply the seeds to farmers in a timely manner and ensure the good quality of the seeds, Hubei Province has established a seed allocation office, and the Hubei Provincial Department of Agriculture and the Grain Department have sent four working groups to Xiaogan, Jingzhou, Xiangyang, and Huanggang Special Districts to provide technical guidance. The agricultural and grain departments of the special districts and counties also transferred cadres to help inspect the seeds. According to the inspection results, the purity and germination rate of the Nanda 2419 wheat improved variety, which is promoted as an improved variety, are both above 90%; the purity and germination rate of general seeds selected from commercial grain are also above 70%-80%.
    As of August 28, the first batch of more than 30 million jin of Nanda 2419 wheat improved variety and 2.5 million jin of barley seeds have begun to be shipped, and it is expected that all allocation tasks will be completed by the end of September.
  Drainage, Land Preparation, and Expansion of Wheat Fields
    (Our Newspaper) Farmers in Ren County, Hebei Province, who suffered from floods, are actively preparing for wheat planting.
    This county has low-lying terrain and suffers from floods every year. The flood season mostly occurs after the wheat harvest. In order to shorten the disaster period, various agricultural cooperatives plan to plant more wheat in low-lying areas this year. The county's seventy-nine agricultural cooperatives plan to plant more than 310,000 mu of wheat, which exceeds last year's wheat field area by 35%. The sowing time is also planned to be ten days to half a month earlier than in previous years. In order to ensure that the sowing is completed according to plan, all localities have first carried out drainage work, combined with clearing the land, removing weeds, and plowing wheat fields. Most of the 6,000 mu of wheat land in Tiankou Agricultural Cooperative was soaked in water. The cooperative organized its members to dig five drainage ditches. By August 26, more than 1,000 mu of land had been drained and reclaimed. It will take another five days to drain all the accumulated water. In order to quickly drain the accumulated water, Luozhuang Township organized a joint drainage committee of the Dongmengtai, Luozhuang, and Daliuzhuang agricultural cooperatives, and extracted 650 members according to the amount of land and labor of each cooperative to carry out day and night damming and drainage. By August 29, six breaches had been dammed, four water-blocking dams had been cleared, and four spillways had been dug, draining more than 9,880 mu of accumulated water. The agricultural cooperative of Zhangtai Township dug two drainage ditches and drained all 650 mu of accumulated water in the entire cooperative in three days. The members also actively cleaned up the remnants of autumn and plowed the land, picking up and plowing each piece. Currently, 2,600 mu of wheat land have been plowed.
    Due to the impact of this year's floods, the wheat seeds left behind have become moldy and deteriorated, and many farm tools have also been smashed. Agricultural cooperatives in various places are seizing the time to select wheat seeds and repair farm tools. The Luozhuang Agricultural Cooperative mobilized its members to dig out the smashed wheat seeds and select and dry them all. The selected wheat seeds have been dried twice and germination tests have been carried out. The cooperative also organized members who knew carpentry to repair forty-six farm tools such as old seeders and broken harrows.
    As of August 29, the county had drained more than 145,000 mu of land, selected and dried more than 1,467,000 jin of wheat seeds. After the selected wheat seeds were tested for germination, the germination rate reached more than 90%. According to the statistics of seventy-seven cooperatives, more than 13,000 large and small farm tools have been repaired, and 34,000 mu of wheat land drained of water have been plowed once. In the past, most farmers in this county planted wheat after the Autumn Equinox. This year, they plan to start before the Autumn Equinox, and the county's wheat planting work will be roughly completed by the end of September.

    抓紧时间准备秋种秋耕
    合理安排秋播面积
    本报讯　江苏省松江专区正紧密结合当前生产，积极进行秋播准备工作。
    今年秋播作物面积如何确定？它涉及二年四熟和二年五熟的交叉进行，双季稻和稻麦两熟的安排，粮食作物和经济作物的搭配，还涉及如何解决肥料、种籽、劳力等各种具体问题。因此，中共松江地委早于八月中旬就领导各县研究和制定秋播方案。后来，地委发现各县提出的方案中，油菜种植面积比国家计划少了十二万亩，双季稻和稻麦两熟的安排也不尽合理。松江地委要求各县在制定秋播面积计划时，要在服从国家计划的前提下既算产量又算产值，并且考虑到实际可能。油菜种植面积不能减少，但各县可在县内进行调整；麦类面积可以适当扩大，但不能因此而减少绿肥面积；棉花低产地区的棉花可以适当减少。各县根据地委的指示，修订了秋播方案。现在各地正在自下而上的讨论修正，青浦县已决定将菜籽产量低的地区的油菜生产任务移到高产地区去，既保证不减少菜籽面积，又可提高单位产量。松江、青浦、金山等晚稻地区今年麦类取得丰收，现已初步决定扩大麦田二十多万亩。
    和这同时，各县还积极进行了秋播的技术准备和物质准备。青浦县已于8月24日开好有五百多个乡、社干部和丰产代表参加的夏熟作物丰产经验交流会，总结了夏季丰产经验。松江县漕泾区北沙乡建新、民建等七个农业社掀起积肥运动，提早准备秋种肥料。各县普遍缺乏绿肥种籽，专区和县的领导机关已派干部去浙江、苏北等地采购。当前缺乏绿肥种籽仍是松江地区各县存在的一个突出问题，需要及早设法解决。　（范万钧）
  检查机具准备下地
    本报讯　陕西省十四个拖拉机站积极准备秋播。今年新建的十个站，将第一次下地，为各个农业社服务。全省秋播机耕地区，将从上半年的十个县、市扩大到二十三个县、市，预计秋季播种面积将达十九万多亩，比去年增加十一倍；冬耕面积五十一万多亩，比去年增加六倍多。汉中盆地和革命圣地延安附近的田野上，将第一次出现拖拉机耕田。
    到目前为止，全省拥有各种类型的拖拉机一百七十八台，和适宜不同土质及播种密度的二十四行、二十八行和四十八行谷类条播机。
    各拖拉机站的职工，正准备在秋播中开展一次大规模的劳动竞赛。
  湖北调出大批麦种
    本报讯　为支援安徽、江苏两省灾区农民迅速恢复生产，和江西、河南两省推广良种，湖北省调出大、小麦种籽九千多万斤。其中调给河南、江西、江苏三省的都是良种南大二四一九；调给安徽省的也有良种二千多万斤。
    为了及时地将种籽供应到农民手里，并保证种籽质量良好，湖北省特成立了种子调拨办公室，并由湖北省农业厅、粮食厅派出四个工作组前往孝感、荆州、襄阳、黄冈四个专区进行技术指导，专区、县的农业、粮食部门也抽调干部帮助检验种籽。根据检验结果，作为良种推广的南大二四一九小麦良种，纯度、发芽率都在90％以上，从商品粮食中挑选出来的一般种籽，纯度、发芽率也在70％—80％以上。
    到8月28日为止，第一批南大二四一九小麦良种三千多万斤，和大麦种籽二百五十万斤，已开始启运，预计在9月底可完成全部调拨任务。
  排水整地扩大麦田
    本报讯　遭受水灾的河北省任县农民，正在积极进行种麦准备工作。
    这个县地势低洼，每年遭受水灾，受灾时间多在麦收后。各农业社为了缩短灾期，今年都计划在洼地多种一些麦子。全县七十九个农业社计划种麦三十一万多亩，这个数字超过去年麦田面积35％。播种时间也计划比往年提前十天到半月。为了保证按计划完成播种，各地都首先突击进行排水工作，并结合进行清地拔草、翻耕麦田。天口农业社六千亩麦地大部被水泡着，社里组织社员挖了五条排水沟，到8月26日已排水脱地一千多亩，再有五天即可把积水全部排完。骆庄乡为了迅速排除积水，组织东盟台、骆庄、达六庄三个农业社的联合排水委员会，按各社土地、劳力数量、抽出六百五十个社员昼夜不停地进行堵口排水。到8月29日已堵好了六个决口，清除了四个挡水坝、挖泄水口四个，已排除积水九千八百八十多亩。彰台乡农业社挖排水沟两道，三天时间把全社六百五十亩积水全部排完。社员们并积极收拾残秋，耕翻土地，作到拾一块，耕一块，现已耕完麦地两千六百亩。
    由于今年水灾的影响，留的麦种霉烂变质，很多农具也被砸坏，各地农业社都在抓紧拣选麦种，修制农具。骆庄农业社发动社员把被砸毁的麦种挖出来，全部进行了拣选翻晒，拣选好的麦种都晒过两次，并作了发芽试验。社里还组织会作木工的社员修了旧耧破耙等四十六件农具。
    截至8月29日，全县排水脱出土地十四万五千多亩，选晒好麦种一百四十六万七千多斤，拣选的麦种经过试验发芽后，出芽率都达到90％以上。据七十七个社统计，已修制好大小农具一万三千多件，排出水的三万四千多亩麦地已翻耕一次。过去这县农民多数是到秋分以后才种麦，今年都计划在秋分前就下手，9月底即可大体结束全县种麦工作。
