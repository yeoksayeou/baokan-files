    A Scientist's Troubles
    In our scientific research work, we often lack medicines and equipment. Unexpectedly, in order to solve this problem, we have encountered numerous difficulties and have not received any support from any aspect. Here is an example.
    We only need a few dozen kilograms of liquid chlorine per year, but we cannot buy it. We contacted the Beijing Water Company, which uses a relatively large amount of chlorine, and asked them to purchase it on our behalf. We sent three official letters, and after two months of correspondence, the final reply was: "Our company's liquid chlorine has already been ordered and shipped by the Beijing Municipal Materials Supply Bureau, so it is difficult to assist." So we sent an official letter to the Beijing Municipal Materials Supply Bureau, and they replied by phone: "First, the chlorine consumption plan needs to be approved by the Beijing Municipal Planning Commission." We sent the chlorine consumption plan, and waited for a month without any response; the second time we wrote to inquire again, but still no response. We thought that we would be waiting for materials for a long time, and even the work would be abandoned halfway, so we were unwilling to give up. We also contacted the Tianjin Chemical Plant, which produces liquid chlorine, to purchase it, and they replied that we should purchase it from the Jinxi Chemical Plant. However, the Jinxi Chemical Plant replied to us: "Please apply to the Sales Department of the Former Ministry of Heavy Industry for allocation. Our factory will handle the order according to the product allocation notification, otherwise it will not be allocated." We were afraid that writing to the Former Ministry of Heavy Industry would encounter the same fate as writing to the Beijing Municipal Planning Commission, and gradually lost confidence in writing official letters. After that, at a meeting, we met a responsible comrade from the Former Chemical Industry Administration, who promised that we could assist. So we wrote to the Former Chemical Industry Bureau with great hope to put forward our requirements, but it was still like a stone sinking into the sea.
    We have sent nine official letters to six units requesting assistance. Since January 21 this year, we have still not purchased the slightest amount of liquid chlorine we need.
    From this, it can be seen that there are many thorns on the road to marching towards science. Although we have not lost confidence in the Party and the government's call to reach the international level in twelve years, we are indeed filled with emotion.
    We suggest that the government set up a special agency to specifically supply the medicines and equipment needed for scientific research.

    科学家的苦恼
    我们在科学研究工作中，常常缺乏药品和器材。想不到为了解决这一问题，我们遇到了重重困难，得不到任何方面的支援，下面举一个例子。
    我们每年只需要几十公斤的液体氯，竟无法买到。我们同用氯量比较大的北京市自来水公司联系，请他们代办，先后发出了三件公函，公文往返两个月，最后回答说：“我公司液体氯已由北京市物资供应局代订起运，碍难协助”。于是我们又给北京市物资供应局发出了公函，他们回电话说：“首先需经北京市计划委员会批准用氯计划。”我们把用氯计划送去，等了一个月不见回音；第二次我们又去信催问，仍然没有回音。我们想到长期停工待料，甚至工作要半途而废，心里有所不甘，又向生产液氯的天津化工厂洽购，他们回信介绍我们向锦西化工厂购买，而锦西化工厂给我们的答复是：“请你校向前重工业部销售处申请分配，我厂根据产品分配通知单办理订货手续，否则不予分配。”我们恐怕向前重工业部去信会碰到和向北京市计划委员会去信的一样遭遇，对写公函渐渐失去了信心。这以后，在一次会议上，见到前化学工业管理局一位负责同志，他答应我们可以协助，于是我们又怀着极大的希望给前化工局去公函提出我们的要求，可是仍然是石沉大海。
    我们曾经向六个单位发出了九件公函请求协助，自今年1月21日起到目前，仍然没有购到我们所需要的点滴的液体氯。
    由此可见，在向科学进军的道路上，荆棘颇多。我们虽对党和政府所号召的十二年达到国际水平，并不因此而失去信心，但确实是感慨万分。
    我们建议政府能够设置一个专门机构，由它们专门供应科学研究工作需要的药品和器材。
