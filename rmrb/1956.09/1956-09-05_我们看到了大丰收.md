    We Have Seen a Great Harvest
    By Ji Qing, Our Correspondent in the Soviet Union
    Our car has traveled over a thousand kilometers on the roads of the Kustanai Region of Kazakhstan. Sometimes we drove in the early morning mist, when the heavy ears of wheat appeared as robust silhouettes on the hazy land. Sometimes we hurried along in the scorching sun. The endless wheat fields stretched to the edge of the earth. We were bathed in a golden sea of wheat, so high that it obscured the car. Sometimes we sped along as the red sun was setting. The harvested wheat lay in rows in the fields, and the remaining stalks stood neatly, looking like marvelous gold carpets woven with vertical and horizontal patterns. In the night, the clatter of tractors echoed in the wheat fields. Although the lights of the combine harvesters were sometimes blocked by the dense wheat, I knew that the combine harvester operators were harvesting day and night.

    In Kustanai, we witnessed this year's great Soviet harvest. The abundant harvest in Kazakhstan has even surpassed the famous "granary" of Ukraine. Kazakhstan, which previously only delivered 50 to 70 million poods to the state each year, or a little over 100 million poods in a good year, has decided to deliver 1 billion poods of grain to the state this year. Kustanai is a region of the Kazakh Republic. A total of five million hectares of wasteland have been reclaimed here, whereas only several hundred thousand hectares of land existed two years ago. The Xiaodelov District of Kustanai, for example, used to be all wasteland. Now, this district has reclaimed 2,500 hectares of land, and there is not a single piece of idle land left in the entire district. People there excitedly told us that the yield from the new land is particularly good, with nearly 25 to 30 quintals of wheat per hectare, and some places yielding 35 quintals per hectare. This year, the Kustanai Region will deliver 260 million poods of grain to the state. This figure is equal to half of the grain delivered by the entire Ukraine.

    This is the harvest season, and the wheat is all ripe. The fields are a sea of gold. The wheat, almost reaching people's shoulders, is skillfully harvested by combine harvesters. In the wheat fields, there are self-propelled combine harvesters and tractor-pulled harvesters, one or two at a time. The harvesters that tow two at a time can harvest about ten meters wide of wheat at the same time, and can carry out more than 40 hectares of wheat field harvesting work every day. In the wheat fields of the Pavlov State Farm, we met the combine harvester operator Jiemiyev. He and his old partner, tractor driver Peterov, harvested a total of 483 hectares of wheat from August 6th to 25th, averaging 24 hectares per day. The day before we went, the harvesting work of the two of them exceeded the quota by 136%. Their tractor was flying the red banner of excellence, and they said to us with confidence: We will keep the red flag on our machine forever. After talking for a while, they drove the tractor into the wheat field again. The abundant wheat immediately swallowed them, and even the tall tractor only showed its head.

    In the threshing ground of every state farm or collective farm, we saw piles of wheat like golden mountains. The grain cleaning machine cleaned the large grains of wheat and piled them up. The grain cleaning machine blew out the wheat husks from its wide mouth. Several automatic loaders automatically transported the clean wheat to the trucks, and then the grain was sent to the purchasing station. There were not many people working on the ground. Only one or two people were operating the grain cleaning machine, and several people were adding new wheat to the place where the automatic loader was loading the wheat, so that the loader could continuously send the wheat to the truck.

    At the threshing ground of the Communist Youth League State Farm, a group of young men and women surrounded us. They came from various cities in the Soviet Union to help harvest the wheat. Last year, this farm only harvested six or seven quintals of wheat per hectare, while this year the average yield is 20 quintals per hectare. Last year, less than one million poods of grain were delivered to the state, while this year three million poods of grain can be delivered to the state. The great harvest has encouraged thousands of young people to help harvest. Each of them wore a summer shirt, some girls wore sweatpants, and their heads were wrapped in colorful headscarves. They were almost all around twenty years old. Deroyenna, a third-year student at the Makhachkala Agricultural College, told me that she loves her major very much, and the practical training here makes her feel very interested. She would like to work on this farm in the future. At the Xiaodelov State Farm, we saw more than 100 young people from Ukraine who came to help harvest, many of whom were students from Kiev University. When they first came, the farm prepared carriage dormitories for them, and specially sent cooks to them, and set up new canteens. Although they will soon return to school, they have fallen in love with this place. Samami, a third-year student in the Physics Department of Kiev University, wrote a song, and the main sentence of the lyrics is this: If there is an ideal in our hearts, it is to reclaim wasteland in Kazakhstan.

    The great Soviet harvest has also attracted many foreign youths. At the Ulk State Farm, we saw 26 Hungarian youths. The tractors and combine harvesters driven by these guests from afar flew the national flags of the Soviet Union and Hungary. They completed their work excellently every day. Now all the Hungarian combine harvester operators have exceeded their quotas by one time. Tractor driver Genochi harvests 15 to 20 hectares every day. Truck driver Glaskel can transport more than 40 tons of grain every day. The farm leaders installed radios in the carriages where they lived, and they could read the newspapers every day. After the harvest, they also held ball games. They are just like at home in the Soviet Union.

    On the fertile land, I saw the young men and women who came to the wasteland for the first time. They have already settled down here. When they first came, they had nothing. Now many people are married, and many people have their own houses. In their rooms, not only are electric lights and radios installed in every household, but almost all have sewing machines and gramophones. Their windows are decorated with embroidered curtains, and pots of flowers are placed on the window sills. Many of them did not have specialized skills in the past, but now they have learned specialized skills. Alexei Yev, who came from Moscow in 1954, is nineteen years old this year. He used to know nothing, but now he is a skilled combine harvester operator and a famous figure at the Ulk State Farm.

    Anyone who has seen the great harvest in Kustanai can hardly imagine that only two or three years ago, this place was still a desolate grassland. Now, in this boundless sea of wheat, prosperous towns are appearing. There are not only spacious clubs, libraries with at least three or four thousand books, well-equipped seven-year or ten-year schools, and shops displaying exquisite Chinese raincoats and leather shoes, but also power plants and tractor repair stations with the sound of motors and machine tools resounding on the grassland. The Communist Youth League State Farm also has a beautiful hospital with more than one hundred beds. People no longer see the past poverty of this grassland.

    The great harvest brings a more prosperous life to the people. At the Sickle and Hammer Collective Farm, we met Prokheda and Ganijin, both 72-year-old men. Last year, although there was a drought and only 1.5 quintals per hectare were harvested, the farm gave each of them ten kilograms of grain, vegetables, milk, and ten rubles of pocket money for each work day in order to take care of the elderly. Originally, the two of them had not worked for a long time, and each received 150 work days of pension every year. This year's bumper harvest made the old people reluctant to stay at home to retire. They said that they had raised cattle, pigs, chickens, geese, and ducks at home, and everything was enough, and they didn't need anything else, but seeing the bumper harvest, as long as they could move, they would participate in the work. This year, Prokheda and Ganijin can get about 500 work days even with their pensions. One person can get 5,000 kilograms of wheat alone. Not long ago, a notice to pre-order cars was sent to the Communist Youth League State Farm, and more than 100 people immediately ordered "Victory" brand cars, and the number of people requesting to order is constantly increasing. Comrade Chiba, the director of the farm, said to us: Please come and see again in two or three years. I believe that our farm will be built almost like an ordinary city.

    This is the great wish of millions of Soviet youths who have reclaimed wasteland. After we visited Kustanai, we are completely convinced that his words will definitely be realized.

    我们看到了大丰收
    本报驻苏联记者　纪青
    我们的汽车在哈萨克斯坦的库斯坦奈州公路上已经奔驰了一千多公里。有时是在早雾未消的晨光中行走，这时沉甸甸的麦穗在蒙胧的大地上现出茁实的身影。有时是在炽热的阳光下赶路，一望无际的麦田一直伸展到大地的边缘，我们都沐浴在金黄色的麦海中，高高的麦子把汽车也遮盖得看不见了。有时也在红日将落的时候疾驰而过，收割的麦子成行地躺在田野上，截剩下的麦秆整齐地站立着，远远望去好像一幅幅织着横竖花纹的奇妙的金地毯。在黑夜里，麦田里边彻夜响着轧轧的拖拉机的声音，虽然联合收割机的灯光有时被密密的麦子挡住了，但是我知道这是联合收割机手们在昼夜不停地进行收割。
    在库斯坦奈，我们看到了今年苏联的大丰收。丰收的哈萨克斯坦把著名的“谷仓”乌克兰也赶过去了。从前每年只向国家交出五千万到七千万普特，好年成也只有一亿多普特的哈萨克斯坦，今年决定交给国家十亿普特的粮食。库斯坦奈是哈萨克共和国的一个州，在这里一共开垦了五百万公顷荒地，而在两年以前只有几十万公顷土地。像库斯坦奈的晓德洛夫区以前都是荒地，现在这个区已经开垦了二千五百公顷土地，全区已经没有一块闲地了。那里的人们兴奋地告诉我们，新地的收成特别好，差不多每公顷都能打二十五公担到三十公担小麦，有的地方每公顷可打三十五公担。今年库斯坦奈州将交给国家二亿六千万普特粮食。这个数字等于全乌克兰所缴粮食的一半。
    这正是收割的季节，麦子已经全都熟了，田地里一片金色，高得几乎挨着人的肩膀的麦子被联合收割机灵巧地收割下来。行走在麦田里的有自动联合收割机，有拖拉机牵引着的一架或两架收割机。牵引着两架的收割机同时可以收割下宽约十公尺的麦子，每天可以进行四十多公顷麦田的收割工作。我们在巴甫洛夫国营农场的麦田里碰到了联合收割机手捷米也夫，他和他的老同伴拖拉机手彼得洛夫从8月6日到25日一共收割了四百八十三公顷麦子，平均每天收割二十四公顷。在我们去的前一天，他们两个人的收割工作超过定额136％。他们的拖拉机上挂着优胜红旗，他们充满信心地向我们说：我们要使红旗永远插在自己的机器上。谈了一会儿，他们就又驾着拖拉机跑到麦田里去了。丰收的麦子马上吞没了他们，连高大的拖拉机也只露出一个脑袋了。
    在每个国营农场或集体农庄的屯麦场上，我们都看到麦子堆积得像一座一座的金山一样，净谷机把颗粒硕大的麦粒筛干净后堆积起来，净谷机在自己宽大的口里吹出了麦皮。几架自动装运机将干净的麦子自动运到载重汽车上面，然后将粮食送到采购站。场上工作的人不多，他们只有一两个人操纵着净谷机，有几个人在自动装运机装去麦子的地方，添进新的麦子，以便使装运机不断地把麦子送到汽车上。
    在共青团员国营农场的屯麦场上，一群青年男女将我们包围起来，他们是从苏联各城市赶来帮助收割麦子的。这个农场去年一公顷只收六、七公担小麦，而今年平均的收成是每公顷二十公担。去年向国家交纳的粮食不到一百万普特，而今年则可以向国家交纳三百万普特粮食。大丰收鼓舞着成千成万的青年来帮助收割，他们每个人都穿着夏天的汗衫，有的女孩子穿着运动裤，头上扎着各色的头巾，他们差不多都是二十岁左右的年纪。有个在马哈奇卡城农业专科学校三年级学习的德罗仁娜告诉我：她很爱自己的专业，这里的实际锻炼使她感到很大兴趣，她很想将来能到这个农场来工作。在晓德洛夫国营农场，我们看到了从乌克兰来帮助收割的一百多位青年，其中有许多是基辅大学的学生。他们初来的时候，农场为他们准备了车厢宿舍，特别为他们派来了炊事员，安设了新食堂，虽然他们不久就要回到学校去了，但他们已经爱上了这个地方，在基辅大学物理系三年级学习的萨玛米编了一支歌，歌词的主句是这样的：假使我们的心里有个理想，那就是到哈萨克斯坦来开荒。
    苏联的大丰收也吸引了很多外国青年，我们在乌尔?克国营农场见到了二十六个匈牙利的青年，这些远方来客驾驶的拖拉机和联合收割机上飘扬着苏匈两国的国旗，他们每天都出色地完成了自己的工作，现在全体匈牙利的联合收割机手已经超额完成定额的一倍。拖拉机手格诺奇每天收割十五公顷到二十公顷。汽车司机格拉斯可尔每天可载运四十吨以上的粮食。农场的领导上在他们所住的车厢里安上了无线电，他们每天可以读到报纸，在收割后还举行了球赛。他们在苏联就好像在自己家里一样。
    在丰收的土地上我看到了初来荒地的男女青年们，他们都已经在这里安家立业了。刚来的时候，他们什么也没有，现在很多人结了婚，很多人都有了自己的住宅，他们的房间里，不仅家家都装上了电灯和无线电，并且差不多都有缝纫机和留声机，他们家里窗前挂着挑花窗帘，窗台上放着一盆盆的鲜花。他们好多人过去没有专门的技术，但现在都学会了专门的本领。1954年从莫斯科来的阿历克赛也夫，今年十九岁，过去什么也不会，现在他已是联合收割机的能手，是乌尔?克国营农场有名的人物了。
    看到过库斯坦奈大丰收的人，谁也难以想像仅仅在两三年以前，这里还是一片荒芜的大草原。现在，在这无边无际的麦海中，出现着一座座的繁荣的城镇。这里不仅有宽敞的俱乐部，藏书至少有三、四千册的图书馆，设备齐全的七年级或十年级学校，以及摆设着中国讲究的雨衣和皮鞋的商店，而且发电厂和拖拉机修理站也在草原上响起了马达和机床的响声。在共青团员国营农场还有一座漂亮的、有一百多床位的医院，人们再也看不到这草原过去贫穷的面貌了。
    大丰收给人们带来更加富裕的生活。在镰刀和锤子集体农庄，我们遇见了普洛赫达和加尼金，他们都是七十二岁的老人了。去年，虽然是旱灾，一公顷只收了一公担半，农庄为了照顾老人，每个劳动日发给他们十公斤粮食、蔬菜、牛奶和零用的十个卢布。本来他们两人早已不工作了，每年每人领一百五十个劳动日的抚恤金。今年的大丰收使老人家再也不肯呆在家里养老了。他们说，家里都养了牛、猪、鸡、鹅和鸭子，一切都够用的，再也不要什么东西了，可是看见了大丰收，他们只要还能动，就要参加工作。普洛赫达和加尼金今年连抚恤金可以得到约五百个劳动日，单单麦子一项，一个人就可以分到五千公斤。不久之前，可以预订汽车的通知送到了共青团员国营农场，马上就有一百多人订购了“胜利”牌小汽车，请求订购的人还在不断地增加。这个农场场长契巴同志对我们说：过了两三年，请你们再来看看，我相信我们的农场将要建筑得和一个普通的城市差不多了。
    这就是开垦荒地的千百万苏联青年伟大的愿望，当我们访问了库斯坦奈以后，我们完全相信他的话是一定能够实现的。
