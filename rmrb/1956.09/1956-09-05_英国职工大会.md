    British Trades Union Congress

    Britain is the country where the workers' movement began earliest in the world. In the second half of the eighteenth century, the workers' movement began when the British industrial proletariat began to form. However, due to the tradition of trade unionism in the British workers' movement, the development of the British workers' movement was delayed, and the unity of the British working class and the trade union movement was hindered.

    The Trades Union Congress was founded in 1868 and has held an annual meeting every year for more than fifty years. The Trades Union Congress is only a consultative body and does not have more power. The resolutions of the conference have little binding force on its subordinate trade unions. Each member union can act freely. In this way, a group of trade union bureaucratic groups that monopolize the trade union movement has been cultivated invisibly. In 1921, under the influence of the British Communist Party and the pressure of the masses, the Supreme Committee of the Trades Union Congress was established, but it was controlled by the trade union bureaucratic group and became an institution for controlling the trade union movement.

    According to British official figures, at the end of 1954, there were 674 trade unions in the country with 9,495,000 members. There are approximately 24 million wage laborers in the UK, meaning that 60% of employees are not organized.

    A total of 183 trade unions have joined the British Trades Union Congress, with more than 8 million members, accounting for 85% of the total number of trade union members. This includes the vast majority of large and medium-sized trade unions in the UK, as well as many small trade unions. Most of those who have not joined the Trades Union Congress are small trade unions.

    Approximately three-quarters of the total membership of the Trades Union Congress are concentrated in seventeen large trade unions, of which the six largest trade unions are: Transport and General Workers' Union (1.25 million members), National Union of General and Municipal Workers (800,000 members), Amalgamated Engineering Union (750,000 members), National Union of Mineworkers (640,000 members), National Union of Railwaymen (450,000 members), Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers (340,000 members).

    These six large trade unions form the "Big Six Group" in the annual meeting of the British Trades Union Congress. Their right-wing leaders use their representation to manipulate the activities of the British Trades Union Congress, and because the Trades Union Congress is the main social foundation of the Labour Party, they also influence the Labour Party's policies.

    The representatives of the annual meeting of the Trades Union Congress are elected by each member organization on the principle of one representative for every 5,000 members. Therefore, at each annual meeting of the Trades Union Congress, when discussing the report submitted by the Supreme Committee and important international and domestic issues, the struggle between the working masses and the right-wing leaders, the progressive forces and the reactionary forces can be reflected to a considerable extent. At the 87th annual meeting held in 1955, fierce struggles were launched on the rights to strike, wages, and strengthening the unity of international working people. However, because the discussions, votes, and elections at the conference were subject to some undemocratic restrictions, the results of the conference often could not correctly represent the opinions of the broad masses of British workers.

    During discussions, the chairman often uses methods of limiting speaking time to restrict discussions that are not liked by the conference leadership group. When electing the Supreme Committee and voting on important issues, the "representative card voting system" is adopted, that is, the voting results are calculated according to the number of trade union members represented by the representatives. In this way, the "group" of large trade unions that controls the vast majority of votes can determine the election results and resolutions of the conference.

    Although the Supreme Committee has always been controlled by right-wing trade union leaders, so that the opinions of the British working masses cannot be fully reflected, the discussions and resolutions of the annual meetings after the war not only involved trade union affairs, wages, welfare and other issues, but also increasingly involved many political issues. This reflects the increasingly high political sentiment of the British working class and the increasingly close combination of the trade union movement and political struggle. The British working class has a powerful force and is very organized. Therefore, the attitude of the Trades Union Congress will, to a considerable extent, affect the policies of the British government.

    After World War II, due to the increase in the political awareness of the British working class and the strengthening of the British Communist Party's trade union work, the progressive tendencies in the British trade union movement have further developed. The development of this progressive tendency is mainly manifested in the increase in the struggle of the trade union masses against the right-wing leaders' policies that do not conform to the interests of the British working class, and the increasing combination of economic and political struggles.

    In terms of striving for and consolidating the rights of trade unions, due to the pressure of the broad masses of workers, the former Labour government had no choice but to abolish the Trade Disputes and Trade Unions Act promulgated in 1927, which prohibited general strikes, in 1946. Although trade union rights have not exceeded the level before the general strike in 1926, it was a great victory compared to before the war. After 1951, this victory was further consolidated, and after 1953, national general strikes were further developed.

    The increasingly close combination of economic and political struggles is specifically manifested in the fact that at the annual meetings of the Trades Union Congress and the annual meetings of various industrial trade unions after the war, many industrial trade union annual meetings passed resolutions that are conducive to world peace, such as improving East-West relations and developing East-West trade, the five major powers signing a peace treaty, reducing armaments and banning atomic weapons, opposing the rearmament of West Germany, opposing colonial policies, requiring international trade union solidarity, requiring the admission of People's China into the United Nations, and requiring the establishment of friendly relations with Soviet and Chinese trade unions. At the annual meeting of the British Electrical Trade Union held on May 17 this year, a resolution was passed by 336 votes to 14, calling for efforts to unite the workers' movement and requiring the British Labour Party to abolish all its resolutions that were detrimental to workers' unity. On June 14, the National Federation of Vehicle Builders passed a resolution unanimously, calling for the withdrawal of all American troops stationed in the UK. In the proposals submitted by various industrial trade unions for consideration by this year's Trades Union Congress, many proposals called for strengthening international trade union solidarity. The Amalgamated Society of Woodworkers and the Fire Brigades Union have expressed their hope for closer relations between the trade unions of the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union. The Tobacco Workers' Union called on the heads of the four major powers to further arrange negotiations to reach an agreement on disarmament. Some proposals called for a large reduction in British military spending and the withdrawal of British troops from Cyprus. These resolutions and proposals of the annual meetings of various industrial trade unions are more representative of the political demands of the broad masses of workers.

    This progressive tendency of the British trade union movement after the war is also reflected in the fact that the number of votes against the Supreme Committee's policies on some important issues at the annual meeting of the Trades Union Congress has increased. For example, on the issue of international trade union unity, the number of votes requiring strengthening international unity of trade unions was only 1.01 million in 1949, only 1.88 million in 1954, and 3.43 million in the annual meeting in 1955. On the issue of rearming West Germany, 2.6 million votes were against it in 1951, which had retreated to 1.88 million votes in 1952, increased to 3.62 million votes in 1954, and also had 3.21 million votes in 1955. As for the resolution on destroying and banning atomic bombs unanimously passed at the 1955 annual meeting, only 1.97 million votes supported it in 1950.

    This year's 88th annual meeting of the British Trades Union Congress opened on September 3. The broad masses of British workers are demanding to further strengthen the unity of the working people and make greater contributions to the cause of world peace, democracy and social progress.

### 英国职工大会

    英国职工大会
    英国是世界上工人运动开始最早的国家。十八世纪下半世纪，当英国产业无产阶级开始形成的时候就开始了工人运动。但由于英国工人运动中工联主义的传统，迟缓了英国工人运动的发展，阻碍了英国工人阶级的团结与工会运动的统一。
    职工大会成立于1868年，五十多年来每年召开一次年会。职工大会只是一个协商机构，没有更多的权力。大会的决议对其下属工会也很少约束力。各会员工会可以自由行动。这样，无形中培养了一批包办工会运动的大工会的工会官僚集团。1921年，在英国共产党的影响与群众压力之下成立了职工大会的最高委员会，但是被工会官僚集团掌握，成为用来控制工会运动的机构。
    根据英国官方数字，截至1954年年底，全国共有六百七十四个工会，九百四十九万五千名会员。英国全国工资劳动者共约二千四百万人，即尚有60％的职工未组织起来。
    加入英国职工大会的共有一百八十三个工会，八百多万名会员，占工会会员总数的85％。其中包括了英国绝大多数大型及中型工会以及许多小工会。没有加入职工大会的大多数是小工会。
    职工大会的全体会员中大约有四分之三集中在十七个大工会里，其中最大的六个工会是：运输及一般工人工会（一百二十五万会员）、全国一般及市政工人工会（八十万会员）、混合机器工会（七十五万会员）、全国矿工工会（六十四万会员）、全国铁路员工工会（四十五万会员）、店员及售货员工工会（三十四万会员）。
    这六个大工会形成了英国职工大会年会中“六大集团”，它们的右派领袖利用他们的代表权，操纵着英国职工大会的活动，而且，由于职工大会是工党的主要社会基础，也左右着工党的政策。
    职工大会年会的代表是由各会员团体按每五千名会员选一个的原则选举产生的，因此在每次职工大会年会上，在讨论最高委员会提出的报告和国际国内的重要问题时，能够相当地反映出工人群众和右派领袖、进步力量与反动力量之间的斗争。在1955年召开的第八十七届年会上，在对罢工的权利、工资、加强国际劳动人民团结等问题上就展开了激烈的斗争。但是由于大会上的讨论、表决和选举受到一些不民主的限制，因此大会的结果常常并不能正确代表英国广大工人群众的意见。
    在讨论时主席往往用限制发言时间的办法来限制不为大会领导集团所喜欢的讨论。在选举最高委员会和就重要问题进行表决时，采用“代表证表决制”，即按代表所代表的工会会员人数来计算表决结果，这样，控制了绝大部分票的大工会“集团”就能够决定大会的选举结果和决议。
    尽管最高委员会一贯被右翼工会领袖所把持，使英国工人群众的意见不能得到充分的反映，但战后历届年会的讨论和决议不仅涉及工会的业务、工资、福利等问题，而且愈来愈多地涉及到许多政治问题。这反映了英国工人阶级愈来愈高涨的政治情绪与工会运动愈来愈密切地与政治斗争结合。英国工人阶级拥有强大的力量，而且很有组织。因此职工大会的态度在相当程度上是会影响英国政府的政策的。
    第二次世界大战以后，由于英国工人阶级政治觉悟的提高和英国共产党对工会工作的加强，英国工会运动中的进步倾向有了进一步的发展。这种进步倾向的发展主要表现在工会群众对右翼领袖的不符合英国工人阶级利益的政策的斗争增加，以及经济斗争和政治斗争日益结合。
    在争取与巩固工会的权利方面，由于广大工人群众的压力，前工党政府不得不在1946年取消在1927年颁布的禁止总罢工的职工纠纷与工会法案。虽然工会权利还没有超过1926年总罢工以前的水平，但比起战前来却是一次很大的胜利。1951年以后，进一步巩固了这一胜利果实，1953年以后全国性的总罢工有了进一步的发展。
    经济斗争与政治斗争的日益密切结合具体表现在战后职工大会年会及各产业工会的年会中，不少产业工会年会通过了改善东西方关系和发展东西方贸易，五大国签订和平公约，裁减军备和禁止原子武器，反对重新武装西德，反对殖民政策，要求国际工会团结，要求接纳人民中国进入联合国，要求与苏联及中国工会建立友好关系等有利于世界和平的决议。在今年5月17日举行的英国电气工会年会上以三百三十六票对十四票通过了号召争取工人运动团结一致和要求英国工党取消它所实行的一切不利于工人团结的决议。6月14日全国造车工人联合会代表大会一致通过了一项决议：要求驻在英国的全部美军撤出英国。在各产业工会提交今年的职工大会考虑的提案中，很多提案号召加强国际工会团结。细木工人联合会和消防队员工会分别表示希望英国和苏联两国工会建立更密切的关系。烟草工人工会号召四大国首脑进一步安排谈判以便就裁军问题达成协议。有些提案要求大量缩减英国军事开支和把英军撤出塞浦路斯。这些产业工会年会的决议和提案是更能代表广大工人群众的政治要求的。
    战后英国工会运动的这种进步倾向也反映在职工大会年会上在一些重要问题上投票反对最高委员会的政策的票数有了增加。例如，在国际工会统一问题上，要求加强工会的国际团结的在1949年仅有一百零一万票，到1954年还只有一百八十八万票，而在1955年的年会上就有了三百四十三万票。在重新武装西德问题上，1951年反对的是二百六十万票，1952年曾退至一百八十八万票，1954年增加到三百六十二万票，1955年也有三百二十一万票。至于1955年年会一致通过的关于销毁和禁止原子弹的决议，在1950年时支持的还只有一百九十七万票。
    今年英国职工大会第八十八届年会已在9月3日开幕了。英国广大工人群众要求进一步加强劳动人民的团结，为世界和平、民主与社会进步的事业作出更大的贡献。
