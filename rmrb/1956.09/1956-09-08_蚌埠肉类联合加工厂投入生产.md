    Bengbu Meat Processing Plant Goes Into Production

    (Our newspaper reports) The newly built state-owned Bengbu Meat Processing Plant in Bengbu City has recently been put into production, and the machinery is operating well.

    This factory is one of the key construction projects of China's first Five-Year Plan. It was designed by Chinese engineers under the guidance of Soviet experts. Except for the ammonia compressor in the power workshop, which uses Hungarian blueprints, all the machinery and equipment are made domestically. The factory site covers an area of more than 160,000 square meters. The main factory buildings include: slaughtering, by-products, casing, oil and fat, cured meat, cooked food, ice-making, and power workshops, as well as a cold storage. The breeding farm can accommodate 4,000 pigs; the sewage treatment equipment in the factory is also relatively complete.

    According to the architectural design standards, this factory can slaughter 1,000 pigs every eight hours. Currently, due to the start of production, the daily output is 800 heads. The frozen meat products are mainly supplied for export. It is estimated that the annual output of frozen meat can earn the country 60,000 tons of steel, and the casing can be exchanged for 90 tractors. Currently, the oil and fat melting workshop is still in the testing phase; in the future, when the cooked food workshop is put into production, most of the internal organs of the pigs can be processed for export.

    The main pig-producing areas in Anhui Province are the Fuyang and Bengbu regions. In the past, a large portion of the annual pig production had to be transported to Shanghai for slaughter and then transshipped for export, which not only incurred high railway transportation costs, but also led to a high mortality rate for the pigs. Bengbu City is located in the middle reaches of the Huai River, with convenient water and land transportation. Most of the pigs in northern Anhui are gathered and distributed here. The commissioning of this meat processing plant is well placed to undertake this task of slaughtering and processing pigs.

### 蚌埠肉类联合加工厂投入生产

    蚌埠肉类联合加工厂投入生产
    本报讯　蚌埠市新建国营蚌埠肉类联合加工厂，已在最近投入生产，机器运转情况良好。
    这座工厂，是我国第一个五年计划重点建设的大型加工厂之一。它是在苏联专家指导下，由我国工程师自己设计的，除动力车间的氨压缩机采用的是匈牙利图纸外，全部机器设备都是国内制造。厂址占地面积十六万多平方公尺，主要厂房包括：屠宰、副产品、肠衣、油脂、腌腊、熟食品、制冰、动力等车间和一冷藏库。饲养场可容纳四千头生猪；厂内的污水处理设备也较为完善。
    按照建筑设计标准，这个厂每八小时可宰生猪一千头，目前因刚投入生产，日产量为八百头。产品冻肉主要供给出口，估计每年所产冻肉可为国家换回六万吨钢材，肠衣可换回九十台拖拉机。目前油脂融化车间还在试车阶段；将来俟熟食品车间投入生产，猪的内脏部分产品经过加工后，大部分可供出口。
    安徽省主要产猪地区为阜阳、蚌埠两专区，过去年产生猪很大部分都要运经上海宰杀后，再转运出口，不但铁路运输费用大，猪的死亡率也很高。蚌埠市当淮河中游，水陆交通方便，皖北生猪大部分在此集散，这座肉类联合加工厂投入生产后，正好承担了这一生猪宰杀和加工制造的任务。
