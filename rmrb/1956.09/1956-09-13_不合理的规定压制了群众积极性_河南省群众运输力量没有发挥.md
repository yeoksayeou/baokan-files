Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 11th. Henan province has not fully utilized the role of the masses' transportation tools.

From January to the end of August this year, Henan Province’s highway transportation experienced severe monthly backlogs of materials. In August alone, 200,000 tons of materials were backlogged. In addition to road blockages due to rain and the extra addition of flood prevention and disaster relief supplies, the main reason for the material backlogs was the failure to fully utilize the potential of the masses' transportation tools.

According to incomplete statistics, farmers in Henan Province, south of the Yellow River alone, own more than 500,000 iron-wheeled carts, and the province can organize more than 10,000 rubber-tired horse-drawn carts, as well as a large number of handcarts and pack animals. In previous years, they have undertaken more than half of the total highway transportation volume. However, this transportation force is not being fully utilized. After the realization of agricultural collectivization throughout the province this spring, more than 8,000 horse-drawn carts joined agricultural production cooperatives. The transportation departments not only did not actively organize these vehicles to participate in transportation, but also imposed many restrictions on them. For example, in terms of road management and taxation, they indiscriminately stipulated that iron-wheeled vehicles and pack animals were not allowed to travel on the highways, and regardless of the length of time or number of trips involved in transportation, they had to pay license fees and road maintenance fees for a quarter or half a year. Regardless of mountainous or plain areas, horse-drawn transport was uniformly charged at 0.28 yuan per ton-kilometer. Hongxing Agricultural Cooperative in Mi County earned 3,240 yuan from coal transportation from January to June, but paid 1,650 yuan in business tax, road maintenance fees, and handling fees alone. This greatly frustrated the enthusiasm of the masses to participate in transportation. In the first half of this year, more than 5,000 horse-drawn carts in the province stopped participating in transportation, and the turnover of goods transported by horse-drawn carts decreased by three-quarters compared with the same period last year.

Another reason affecting the enthusiasm of the masses to participate in transportation is that since this spring, party and government leaders at all levels have at one time focused on agricultural production and capital construction, while neglecting the leadership of transportation and other sideline occupations. The vast majority of agricultural cooperatives have incorporated most of the labor force that previously participated in transportation and other sideline production into agricultural production teams and invested them in agricultural production and capital construction. A small number of agricultural cooperatives that still maintain transportation activities have also failed to implement the spirit of "more work, more pay" in terms of work points and subsidies for transportation personnel, thus reducing transportation efficiency. Due to the neglect of organizing mass transportation, in addition to directly affecting the completion of transportation plans, the income of farmers has also been greatly affected.

Not long ago, the financial and economic work conference of the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China studied the above problems. Some unreasonable regulations and cumbersome transportation procedures in highway management and taxation have now been revised and simplified. According to the new regulations, license fees and road maintenance fees are generally charged based on the actual situation, and transportation prices have also been adjusted somewhat. Various transportation departments have also proactively signed transportation contracts with agricultural cooperatives. At present, a total of 7,000 horse-drawn carts in the province have signed transportation contracts, and some horse-drawn carts have resumed transportation.

### 不合理的规定压制了群众积极性  河南省群众运输力量没有发挥

    不合理的规定压制了群众积极性
    河南省群众运输力量没有发挥
    新华社郑州11日电　河南省没有充分发挥群众的运输工具的作用。
    从今年1月到8月底，河南省公路交通运输每月物资积压现象都很严重。仅8月份积压的物资就有二十万吨。造成物资积压的原因，除了道路一度因雨阻塞和额外增添了防汛救灾物资以外，主要是没有充分发挥群众手中运输工具的潜在力量。
    据不完全统计，目前河南省仅黄河以南地区农民手中的铁轮大车就有五十多万辆，全省可以组织运输的胶轮汽马车有一万多辆，还有大批架子车、驮兽等。它们历年承担的运输量都占公路运输总量的一半以上。但是目前这部分运输力量却没有得到充分利用。今年春天，全省实现了农业合作化以后，有八千多辆汽马车加入了农业生产合作社。交通部门不但没有积极组织这些车辆参加运输，还对它们提出很多限制，比如在公路管理和税收方面，不加区别地规定不准铁轮车、驮兽在公路上通行，不论参加运输的时间长短、车次多少，都得交纳一季或半年的牌照费、养路费，不分山区、平原马车运输每吨公里一律二角八分等等。密县红星农业社1至6月份运煤收入为三千二百四十元，仅营业税、养路费、手续费等即付出一千六百五十元。这样便大大地挫折了群众参加运输的积极性。今年上半年全省就有五千多辆汽马车停止参加运输，马车承运的物资周转量比去年同期减少了四分之三。
    影响群众参加运输的积极性的另一个原因，是今春以来各级党、政领导，都曾一度偏重于农业生产和基本建设，而忽视了对运输等副业的领导。绝大多数农业社都把过去参加运输和其他副业生产的人力绝大部分编进了农业生产队，投到农业生产和基本建设上去。少数还保持着运输活动的农业社，在从事运输人员的工分、补助等问题上，也没有贯彻“多劳多得”的精神，因此也减低了运输效率。由于忽视组织群众运输，除了直接影响运输计划的完成以外，农民的收入也受到了极大的影响。
    不久以前，中共河南省委员会召开的财经工作会议已经对以上问题进行了研究。公路管理和税收方面存在的一些不合理的规定和繁琐的运输手续，目前已得到修改和简化。按照新的规定，牌照费、养路费一般根据实际情况计收，运价也有些调整。各个运输部门还主动地同农业社签订了运输合同。现在，全省签订了运输合同的马车共达七千辆，有一部分马车已经恢复运输。
