    Distressed
    Ma Tieding

    In my studies, I have distress...

    Perhaps it is because of this distress that I often think of what my best uncle told me when I was a child. He said that when he was my age, his grandfather's pampering and spoiling turned him into the most undisciplined student. His grandfather did not blame him but only blamed the teacher for being incompetent. During the four or five years he attended school, he changed seven private tutors. The third or fourth time he left a private tutor, his grandfather sent him to deliver the tuition fee to the unlucky old-fashioned teacher, with a note attached that read: "Sending my young son to deliver tuition fee of ×× yuan, respectfully thanking you for your efforts in misleading my child."

    The attitude of my uncle when telling the story, which was both sympathetic to the teacher and greatly admiring of his grandfather, made me admire my grandfather's unconventional behavior.

    Even now, this story still has power in my heart. When I accidentally hear something like, "We learn this from foreign countries, and that from foreign countries, aren't we just learning to be bad!" my feeling of admiration arises spontaneously, this style is indeed comparable to my grandfather. When I equally accidentally hear another voice: "What is there to learn from foreign countries? We have plenty of good things of our own!" I excitedly think: Grandfather, you are indeed outdated, because you still believe that there must be a teacher!

    However, my distress has not been conquered. After all, I am older, and "childlike innocence" cannot be maintained for long, and the family's heritage has not been well inherited. Because there is always a naughty child's shadow jumping in front of me, and I fantasize that this shadow is my uncle when he was young. This makes me think about my own studies, and remember how much benefit we have gained from learning from foreign experiences, and remember the great countries that I respect, who serve as our role models. Of course, I also deeply believe that in recent years, we have had problems in learning from foreign experiences. This problem is dogmatism. If we rigidly move immature experiences from other countries, it will naturally cause drawbacks; even if it is the mature and advanced experience of others, if it is not combined with the specific situation of this time and place, it will also cause errors. And we have done this in many places. Since this is the case, then if you learn badly, can you say that the teacher is not good? Dogmatism is like a naughty child, even the best teacher is powerless.

    Therefore, I am distressed by my own shortcomings, and at the same time, I have found a way to eliminate distress.

    苦恼
  　马铁丁
    在学习中，我是有苦恼的……。
    也许就因为有苦恼的原故吧，常想到儿时跟我最要好的叔叔给我讲的话。他说：他像我那么大的时候，祖父对他的娇惯、溺爱，使他变成一个最不务正的学生。祖父却不责备他，只怪先生不行。他上学的四五年间，竟换了七个私塾。在他第三次或是四次离开某私塾的时候，祖父派他为那位倒霉的冬烘先生送束修，附的小条上面写着：“派小儿送束修××元，谨酬误人子弟之劳”。
    叔叔讲故事时那种既对先生有点同情、又对祖父大为惊羡的态度，使我佩服祖父的不同凡俗的举动。
    到如今，这个故事还在我的心中保持着力量。当我偶然听到这样一种话：“这也学外国，那也学外国，还不是学坏了！”我的惊羡的感情就油然而生了，这种气派确可与祖父媲美。等我同样偶然地听到另一种声音：“外国有什么可学的，我们自己的好东西多着呢！”我激动地想：祖父呵，你到底是落伍了，因为你毕竟还相信要有先生！
    然而，我的苦恼还没有被征服。年纪到底大些了，“童心”总是维持不了好久，家传的衣钵竟也没有好自继承。因为，我的面前总还跳动着一个玩皮的儿童的影子，这个影子被我幻想成为幼年的叔叔。于是使我想到我自己的学习，想起我们在向外来的经验的学习中得到了多么巨大的益处，想起我所崇敬的、做为我们的榜样的伟大的国家。当然，我也深信，近年来，我们在学习外来的经验中，也是有毛病的。这毛病，就是教条主义。把人家还不成熟的经验生硬地搬运过来，自然会造成弊端；就是人家已成熟的先进经验，如果不与此时此地的具体情况结合起来，也会造成错误。而我们在许多地方是这样做了。既然如此，那么，如果你学坏了，能说是先生不好吗？教条主义如同玩皮的孩子一样，再好的先生，也是无能为力的。
    于是，我为了自己的这种毛病苦恼了，同时也从这里找到了一个消除苦恼的途径。
