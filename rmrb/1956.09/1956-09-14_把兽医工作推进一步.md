    Further Advance Veterinary Work
    Jian Hong
    During the few days of attending the National Folk Veterinarian Symposium, I learned that these ordinary farmer-looking people are using their labor and skills to protect the healthy growth of thousands upon thousands of draught animals and livestock across the country.
    Gao Guojing, the chief physician of the Changzhi Prefectural Veterinary Station, is an eighth-generation hereditary veterinarian with 46 years of practical experience. When some severely ill livestock cannot be cured by other veterinarians, he can cure them; diseases that others cannot diagnose, he can diagnose. In the Jinzhong area, he is known among the peasant masses as the "Living Horse King." After liberation, he became even more enthusiastic about veterinary work. Since joining the Changzhi Prefectural Veterinary work in 1951, he has greatly developed the veterinary work in the entire prefecture. In the past few years, he and another Western medicine veterinarian have trained and cultivated more than 1,400 apprentices. In addition to his regular training work of imparting skills to others, he also undertakes heavy medical work. In two years, the station has treated more than 17,000 sick livestock, with a cure rate of over 99%, of which about 60% were personally treated by Dr. Gao Guojing. Thanks to his efforts and the efforts of local veterinary personnel, 181 veterinary stations have been established throughout the prefecture, and the work of watching over and protecting livestock has been popularized in all agricultural cooperatives in various counties. Because of the development of these tasks, several major livestock diseases prevalent in the prefecture have been significantly reduced. Foot-and-mouth disease has been basically eliminated, and diseases such as gas gangrene, sheep pox, and Newcastle disease can be quickly eradicated once discovered.
    Folk veterinarians in other regions have also played similar major roles. From 1953 to 1955, Sichuan Province cured 1.5 million cattle and pigs, of which more than 90% were treated by folk veterinarians.
    Mr. Wang Yingbing, a famous veterinarian in Xinjiang Province who is proficient in internal medicine, surgery, acupuncture and other techniques, began running a Chinese veterinary clinic 40 years ago. Even now, farmers bring 60 to 70 or more than 100 draught animals to him for treatment every day, and sick animals within a radius of 100 to 200 li are also brought to him for treatment. The vast majority can be cured.
    The speeches of these representatives also showed that many folk veterinarians, under the leadership of the Party and the government, have fully utilized the valuable experience of the motherland's veterinary medicine and have made creative developments on this basis. For example, Dr. Li Shunru of the Wuming County Veterinary Clinic in Guangxi, after painstaking research in the face of the local swine fever epidemic, created an effective method of treating swine fever with dragonfly liquid. Later, it was discovered that although this agent was effective, it did not last long and would stink after a few days. To this end, he and a Western doctor cooperated and conducted research, and after strict disinfection, the mouth of the bottle was sealed with yellow wax. Dragonfly injection solution treated in this way can be stored for a long time.
    In the speeches of many representatives, it was unanimously believed that the reason why veterinary work has achieved such results is inseparable from the Party's policy of uniting, using, educating, and improving folk veterinarians. In recent years, the agricultural leading organs in many provinces and cities have not only equipped many cadres and allocated a large amount of materials to support the development of veterinary work, but also created many convenient conditions for improving the technology of folk veterinarians. Shaanxi Province has universally organized folk veterinarian associations from the bottom up, and regularly holds veterinarian representative meetings and symposiums to exchange experiences and study techniques. Some provinces hold a provincial folk veterinarian representative meeting every year. In order to facilitate the exchange of experience among folk veterinarians, the Hunan Provincial Department of Agriculture began to sort out and identify herbal medicines throughout the province in 1953. At present, more than 300 kinds of medicinal specimens for treating livestock diseases have been collected and pressed.
    At the symposium, the representatives reflected the most on the unreasonable phenomenon of folk veterinarian remuneration. The representative of the cadres in charge of veterinary work in Shanxi Province said that most of the teachers in many county veterinary stations are well-known local veterinarians. They used to earn 70 to 80 yuan per month, but after entering the station, they only had a fixed salary of 40 yuan per month, and some could not even support their families. Some veterinary personnel often have to travel long distances in treatment and epidemic prevention work, but receive very little or even no remuneration. Some representatives also said that some veterinarians who have joined agricultural cooperatives receive the same points as ordinary laborers, and some are only slightly higher than ordinary laborers, which is not reasonable enough. In addition, everyone also reflected on issues such as the organizational form of veterinary personnel and the lack of training materials and the inability to buy medicines and equipment for livestock. They all hope to further advance veterinary work on the existing basis.

    把兽医工作推进一步
    剑虹
    在参加全国民间兽医座谈会的几天中，我了解到这些普通农民模样的人们，用他们的劳动和技术，保护着全国千千万万只耕畜和家畜健壮的生长。
    长治专署兽医站的主任医师高国景，他是八世祖传的兽医，他本人也有四十六年行医的实际经验。有些患了重病的牲口，别的兽医看不好时，他去就可以治好；别人诊断不清的病，他可以诊出来。晋中一带的农民群众中，称他为“活马王”。解放后，他对兽医工作更热心了，从1951年参加长治专署兽医工作以来，使全专区的兽医工作有了很大的开展。几年来他和另一位西医兽医，共训练培养出了一千四百多个学徒。他除了担任经常的训练工作向别人传授技术外，还担任着繁重的医疗工作。两年间，经这个站医疗的病畜就有一万七千多头，治愈率达99％以上，其中经高国景医师亲自治疗的占60％左右。由于他和当地兽医人员的努力，使全专区建立起了一百八十一个兽医站，看槽保畜工作普及到了各县的各个农业社。正因为这些工作的开展，使流行在这个专区的几种主要畜病，显著减少。口蹄疫已基本消灭，对气肿疽、羊痘、鸡新城疫等疫病，一经发现，很快就可扑灭。
    其他一些地区的民间兽医也发挥了类似的重大作用。四川省1953至1955年治愈的牛和猪达一百五十万头，其中90％以上都是民间兽医治疗的。
    新疆省精通内、外科、针灸等技术的名兽医王应炳老先生，从四十年前就开始办中兽医诊疗所，直到现在，农民每天牵到他那里看病的耕畜有六、七十头至一百多头，一二百里以内的病畜也都牵到他那里去看。绝大部分都可治疗好。
    从这些代表的发言中还说明了，许多民间兽医，在党和政府的领导下充分运用了祖国兽医的宝贵经验，并且在这基础上作了创造性的发挥。例如：广西武鸣县兽医诊疗所的李顺儒医师，在当地猪瘟流行的情况下，经过苦心研究，创造了用蜻蜓液治疗猪瘟的有效办法。后来又发现这种药剂虽然有效，但是放不长久，过几天就要发臭。为此，他和西医合作又进行了研究，经过严密的消毒，用黄腊密封了瓶口，这样处理后的蜻蜓注射液，可以放很长时期。
    在许多代表的发言中，一致认为：兽医工作所以有这样的成绩，是和党对民间兽医团结、使用、教育、提高的政策分不开的。几年来，许多省、市的农业领导机关，不仅配备了许多干部、拨出了大量的物资扶助兽医工作的开展，并且为提高民间兽医的技术创造了许多便利条件。陕西省已自下而上地普遍组织起了民间兽医协会，经常召开兽医代表会、座谈会，交流经验，研究技术。有些省每年都召开一次全省的民间兽医代表会。湖南省农业厅为了便于民间兽医交流经验，从1953年开始了对全省生草药物的整理和鉴定工作。现在，已搜集压制了三百多种治疗畜病的药物标本。
    座谈会上代表们对民间兽医报酬的不合理现象，反映的最多。山西省主管兽医工作的干部代表说，许多县兽医站的老师，大部分是当地较出名的兽医，原来每月可收入七、八十元，入站后每月只有四十元固定薪金，有的连家也养不了。还有些兽医人员在治疗和防疫工作中，常常要跑很多路，报酬很少，甚至没有报酬。还有些代表说：有些入了农业社的兽医，和平常劳动力得一样的分，有的仅比平常劳动力稍高一点，这是不够合理的。此外大家还反映了兽医人员组织形式问题以及缺乏训练教材和买不到畜用的药品、器械等各种问题。他们都希望在现有基础上，把兽医工作再向前推进一步。
