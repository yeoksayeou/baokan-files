Comrade Bao Erhan, Vice Chairman of the National People's Congress Ethnic Affairs Committee, spoke:

    I fully agree with the reports made to the congress by Comrades Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, and Deng Xiaoping on behalf of the Party Central Committee.
    The experience of the Chinese revolution has repeatedly proven that the Party's ethnic policies, united front policy, and religious policy are completely correct. In the years since Xinjiang's liberation, due to the resolute implementation of the ethnic policies, united front policy, and the policy of freedom of religious belief formulated by the Party Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, the religious community, upper-class figures in pastoral areas, and democratic figures from various ethnic groups and circles have been widely united. As a result, the internal unrest instigated by imperialist elements in Xinjiang was successfully quelled shortly after Xinjiang's liberation, enabling Xinjiang to achieve significant accomplishments in politics, economy, culture, education, health, and other areas. The socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce, which began last year, was able to proceed smoothly. Han cadres and the People's Liberation Army stationed in Xinjiang, with a brotherly attitude, sincerely helped the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang with much work and cultivated a large number of ethnic cadres. The people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang expressed their deep gratitude to the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and the sincere help of Han cadres and troops stationed in Xinjiang.
    During our recent visit to the Middle East and Near East Arab countries that believe in Islam, we were warmly welcomed and loved by people from all walks of life. The people of Arab countries have great sympathy and expectations towards the Chinese people who overthrew the reactionary rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism. This visit made me more aware of the enormous influence of the Party's ethnic policies, united front policy, and religious policy abroad. Imperialists had wantonly slandered our country in Islamic countries, falsely claiming that we adopted a "policy of eliminating religion" in an attempt to provoke friendly relations between the people of Arab countries and our people. Since Comrade Zhou Enlai's contact with the heads of government of Arab countries at the Bandung Conference, the friendly relations between our country and Arab countries have been restored. Many people from countries such as Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Sudan, and Pakistan have successively visited our country and relayed the facts of religious freedom and ethnic equality they saw with their own eyes in China to the people of their countries. Our cultural and artistic delegations, trade delegations, and Islamic Hajj delegations once again explained our policy of religious freedom and ethnic equality during their visits to Arab countries. Therefore, the deceptive propaganda of imperialism was powerfully exposed. Our government and people expressed firm support for Egypt's righteous action of exercising national sovereignty by nationalizing the Suez Canal Company, further enhancing the friendly relations between the people of Arab countries and our country. Sheikh Abdullah Kari Kahar, one of the highest religious leaders in Jordan, told us: "The Hajj delegation organized by Chiang Kai-shek originally attempted to spread rumors and slander against you here, but they were severely refuted as soon as they opened their mouths. We answered them, 'We are inclined towards the People's Republic of China because they treat us with friendship and firmly support Egypt in nationalizing the Suez Canal Company, supporting Arab countries against imperialism.'"
    There are approximately 300 million people who believe in Islam worldwide, and most of the countries that believe in Islam are located in Asia and Africa. Except for China, the Soviet Union, and other liberated countries, the people who believe in Islam are still suffering from imperialist oppression. In order to exploit the nations of these countries for a long time, imperialists have used various methods to sow discord among followers of Islam and other religions. However, these imperialist tricks will no longer be easy to play in these countries in the future. During the visit of our country's Islamic Hajj delegation, government officials, religious figures, and other social figures from various countries told us: "The people of the Arab system of countries have now awakened, especially after the Suez Canal issue, which has further promoted the awakening of the people of various countries." As a result of the desperate oppression of these countries by decadent imperialism, the people of various countries who are unwilling to be subjected to imperialist aggression and enslavement have united, regardless of ethnicity, religious belief, political affiliation, or social status, for the common interests of everyone, and are resolutely opposed to imperialist colonial policies. This struggle is rising day by day. I personally saw many elderly religious leaders exposing the crimes of imperialism in mosques and at mass rallies, calling on everyone to resist aggression. This proves that the colonial policies of imperialism have disintegrated in these countries, and it is difficult for imperialism to use the religions of these countries for their own benefit. The great Lenin said that the time will come when hundreds of millions of Asian people will become an active factor in world history and will play their role in determining the destiny of all mankind. This prediction is now being realized.
    During our visit to the Arab countries, we have invited religious figures from Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, and other countries to visit our country separately from November of this year to May of next year. We have also invited the former Prime Minister of Lebanon and the former Prime Minister of Jordan to visit our country this winter and spring. They have long been oppressed by imperialism, and they want to come to China to see for themselves because they have seen the great achievements made by the Chinese people.
    Two Suggestions
    Finally, I have two suggestions:
    First, within the country, we should further implement the ethnic policies, united front policy, and policy of freedom of religious belief put forward by the Party Central Committee, give play to the enthusiasm of people from all ethnic groups and circles, and serve our country's socialist construction cause. We ask Han cadres to continue to help Xinjiang and other provinces' ethnic minorities to carry out their work. This kind of help is not only needed now, but will also be needed in the future. We must guard against Han chauvinism and also guard against local nationalism. We must know that only under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the brotherly help of the Han people can the political, economic, cultural, educational, and health construction undertakings of our various ethnic minorities develop rapidly and the historical inequalities between ethnic groups be completely eliminated.
    Second, we should continue to strengthen international united front work. We should visit foreign countries and invite foreign friends to visit our country. On the basis of equality and mutual benefit, we should send cultural and artistic delegations and trade delegations to visit each other and provide economic assistance to each other as much as possible, so that oppressed countries can gradually get rid of imperialist control, become independent and autonomous, and enhance the friendly relations between our country and the people of all countries. We should establish more contacts with Arab countries in the future and support their revolution. The people of Arab countries need to understand the situation in our country, and we should translate the history of our national liberation movement, the situation of national construction, and other relevant materials into Arabic and recommend them to the Arab people. New Chinese films should be translated into Arabic and shown to the Arab people. Our news should also be translated into Arabic and broadcasted to the outside world. We are currently lacking Arabic translation talents. I propose that young people and university students of all ethnic groups be quickly selected and sent to Egypt, Syria, and other countries to study. The conditions for studying translation there are superior. What takes four years in our country's universities can be done in two years there, and many terms of dialects and national customs can be learned.
    We believe that the united front policy and other policies put forward by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao will continue to play a significant role in domestic and international work. In this great era of vigorous development of the peace and democracy movement, under the leadership of the Party, we must work harder to make it a powerful factor in safeguarding world peace, democracy, and the victory of socialism.

### 党的民族政策、统一战线政策和宗教政策在国内外的胜利

    党的民族政策、统一战线政策和宗教政策在国内外的胜利
    全国人民代表大会民族委员会副主任委员　鲍尔汉同志的发言
    我完全同意刘少奇同志、周恩来同志、邓小平同志代表党中央委员会向大会所作的报告。
    中国革命的经验一再证明，党的民族政策、统一战线政策和宗教政策是完全正确的。新疆解放后几年来，由于坚决执行了以毛泽东同志为首的党中央所制订的民族政策、统一战线政策和宗教信仰自由的政策，广泛地团结了宗教界、牧区上层人士和其他各族各界的民主人士，因而新疆解放不久就顺利地平息了帝国主义分子在新疆煽动起来的内乱，使新疆在政治、经济、文教卫生等各方面取得了重大成就，使从去年开始展开的对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，得以顺利地进行。汉族干部和中国人民解放军驻新疆部队，以兄弟般的态度，诚心诚意地帮助新疆各族人民做了许多工作，又培养出大量的民族干部。新疆各族人民，对党中央的正确领导，对汉族干部以及驻新疆部队的真诚帮助，表示十分感激。
    我们这次在中东和近东各信仰伊斯兰教的阿拉伯国家访问中，受到各界人士的热烈欢迎和爱戴。阿拉伯各国人民对推翻了帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义反动统治的中国人民，寄予很大的同情和期望。经过这次访问，使我更加体会到党的民族政策、统一战线政策和宗教政策，在国外所发生的巨大影响。帝国主义曾在各伊斯兰教国家肆意诬蔑我国对宗教采取“消灭政策”，企图挑拨阿拉伯各国人民与我国人民之间的友好关系。自从周恩来同志在万隆会议上同阿拉伯各国政府首脑接触后，就使我国和阿拉伯各国之间的友好关系重新恢复。埃及、叙利亚、黎巴嫩、苏丹和巴基斯坦等国家的许多人士，先后到我国进行访问，将他们亲眼看到的中国信教自由和民族平等的事实，转告给他们国家的人民；我国文化艺术代表团、贸易代表团和伊斯兰教朝觐团在阿拉伯各国访问中，再次说明我国信教自由和民族平等的政策。因而，有力地揭穿了帝国主义的欺骗宣传。我国政府和人民，对埃及把苏伊士运河公司收归国有的履行国家主权的正义行动，表示坚决支持，使阿拉伯各国人民和我国的友好关系更加增强了。约旦宗教界最高首领之一谢以合——阿卜杜拉·卡里卡勒对我们说：“蒋介石组织的朝觐团本来企图在这里造谣中伤你们，但他们一开口就受到我们的严厉的驳斥，我们回答他们说：‘我们倾向中华人民共和国，因为他们对我们采取友好态度，坚决支持埃及把苏伊士运河公司收归国有，支持阿拉伯国家反对帝国主义。’”
    全世界信仰伊斯兰教的约有三亿多人，信伊斯兰教的国家大多数处在亚非地区。信仰伊斯兰教的人民，除了中国、苏联等已经解放了的国家外，现在还受着帝国主义的压迫。帝国主义为了长期压榨这些国家的民族，曾经利用各种办法，在伊斯兰教和其他宗教信徒中进行挑拨离间。但是帝国主义的这种阴谋手段，今后在这些国家再也不好玩弄了。我国伊斯兰教朝觐团访问期间，各国政府官员、宗教界人士及其他社会人士对我们讲：“阿拉伯系统的各国人民现在已经觉醒了，特别是苏伊士运河问题发生后，更加促进了各国人民的觉悟。”由于腐朽的帝国主义拼命压迫这些国家的结果，不愿再受帝国主义侵略奴役的各国人民，不分民族、宗教信仰、政治派别、社会地位，为了大家共同的利益已经团结起来，坚决反对帝国主义的殖民政策。这种斗争，正在日益高涨起来。我亲眼看见许多年长的宗教领袖在礼拜寺、在群众大会上揭露帝国主义的罪恶，号召大家抵抗侵略。这证明帝国主义的殖民政策在这些国家已经瓦解，帝国主义很难再利用这些国家的宗教为他们牟利了。伟大的列宁说，亿万亚洲人民成为世界历史上的一个积极的因素，而且在决定全人类的命运中，起他们的作用的时候将会到来。这一预言，现在正在实现。
    我们在阿拉伯访问期间，已经邀请埃及、叙利亚、黎巴嫩、约旦等国家的宗教界人士，于今年十一月到明年五月间分别来我国访问；并邀请黎巴嫩前任总理、约旦前任首相在今冬明春也来我国访问。他们长期受着帝国主义的压迫，看到中国人民取得了巨大成就，因而想来中国亲眼看一看。
    两点建议
    最后，我提两点建议：
    第一，在国内应该进一步贯彻执行党中央提出的民族政策、统一战线政策和信教自由政策，发挥各族各界人士的积极性，为我国的社会主义建设事业服务。我们要求汉族干部继续帮助新疆及其他各省少数民族进行工作，这种帮助不仅现在需要，将来也还需要。我们要谨防大汉族主义，同时也要谨防地方民族主义。要知道，只有在中国共产党的领导和汉族兄弟般的帮助下，我们各少数民族的政治、经济、文教卫生等各种建设事业才能迅速发展，才能彻底消除历史上遗留下来的民族间的不平等现象。
    第二，继续加强国际统一战线工作。我们访问外国也请外国朋友们访问我国。在平等互利的原则下，派文化艺术代表团、贸易代表团互相往来，在经济上尽可能互相援助，使被压迫的国家逐步摆脱帝国主义的控制，独立自主起来，并增进我国与各国人民之间的友好关系。我们和阿拉伯各国，今后应该建立更多的联系，支持他们的革命。阿拉伯各国人民需要了解我国情况，应当把我国的民族解放运动历史、国家建设情况和其他方面的有关资料，译成阿拉伯文字，推荐给阿拉伯人民。应该把新中国的电影，译成阿拉伯语言和阿拉伯人民见面。我国的新闻消息也应该译成阿拉伯文字对外广播。我们现在缺少阿拉伯文字的翻译人材，我提议迅速选派各族青年、大学生去埃及、叙利亚等国学习。在那里学习翻译的条件优越，在我国大学需要四年的，在那里两年就行了，并且可以学会方言和民族风俗上许多用语。
    我们相信党中央和毛主席提出的统一战线政策和其他各项政策，将在国内工作和国际工作中，继续发挥其重大作用。我们必须在这和平民主运动蓬勃发展的伟大时代，在党的领导下，更加努力做好我们的工作，使之成为保卫世界和平民主与社会主义胜利的有力因素。
