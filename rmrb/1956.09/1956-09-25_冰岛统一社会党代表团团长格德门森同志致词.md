Dear Comrades,

	On behalf of the Icelandic United Socialist Party, I extend sincere thanks to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China for your kind invitation to attend your Party's Eighth Congress and for the warm reception we have received here in Beijing, the capital of China. The three comrades delegated to undertake this meaningful long journey are very pleased with this unexpected opportunity to learn about your beautiful, rich, and vast country and to personally connect with the people who participated in your liberation struggle and great construction work. We are also delighted by the rare opportunity to meet with comrades from many other countries.

	We three comrades represent a very small nation that has long lived in a remote and distant country. Therefore, I think it is necessary to say a few words about our people and our homeland.

	Far, far away, almost directly opposite China on the other side of the globe, close to the Arctic Circle, lies a mountainous island. On this hilly island, the world's smallest nation has been fighting for its survival for over a thousand years, battling volcanic eruptions, drifting Arctic icebergs, and fierce wind and snow. Our ancestors, fleeing the oppression of an invading tyrant on the mainland, sailed to this remote, uninhabited, and rocky island, seeking a place to live a free and independent family life. They had not lived in this new place for long before they felt the need to establish a republic, enact laws for the residents, and establish Europe's first legislative parliament. For about four hundred years, these few residents maintained their independence and sovereignty. Later, due to internal strife and conflicts within the ruling class, the country's sovereignty fell into the hands of foreign monarchs. The country gradually became a colony for almost seven hundred years until, twelve years ago, it first declared sovereignty to belong to our parliament and was recognized by other countries. In the previous twenty-five years, the national struggle for independence had virtually ceased because the rulers at the time approved a treaty granting us the right to establish a republic when the twenty-five-year term expired.

	After 1918, Iceland's political life took on a form similar to that of other countries at the time. The working people's class consciousness had awakened. Dispersed trade unions united, and their struggle to improve living standards quickly developed into a political class struggle. The first political party of labor was the Social Democratic Party. However, the radical tendency among the workers grew stronger, and the Communist Party was founded in 1930. Seven years later, the Communist Party won three seats in parliament. Subsequently, a considerable number of Social Democrats joined forces with the Communists to establish the "United Socialist Party." This successful new party grew rapidly in influence, winning 20 percent of the vote in the parliamentary elections of 1942, and two ministerial positions in the coalition government two years later.

	During the last World War, Britain occupied our country under the pretext that fascist forces might land in our country. We formally protested this occupation. However, later, our government consulted with the United States, which was still neutral at the time, and allowed American troops to take over the defense. The "United Socialist Party" opposed the ratification of this treaty in parliament, even though the treaty itself guaranteed that American troops would be immediately and completely withdrawn after the end of the war. However, after the end of the war, the United States not only did not withdraw but attempted to immediately demand the establishment of permanent military bases. Thanks to the efforts of the "United Socialist Party," which held ministerial positions in the government at the time, the parliament unanimously passed a resolution refusing to allow these troops to be stationed in our country during peacetime. A year later, new elections were held. At that time, all parties except our party united to conduct a frantic anti-communist campaign, attempting to completely isolate us, while the United States gradually obtained the promises we had previously withdrawn. The new and subsequent coalition governments, despite the constant opposition of the "United Socialist Party," successively agreed to accept "Marshall Aid" and participate in the "North Atlantic Group." In 1951, using the Cold War in Germany and the hot war in Korea as excuses, new American troops landed in our country. A radar network was established in our coastal areas; large-scale base construction projects made the non-productive dollar expenditure in our financial budget excessively large, affecting the lives of our people. Our allies in the Atlantic Alliance were unwilling to open their markets to accommodate our exports, so even a reactionary government had to turn to conduct large-scale trade with the Soviet Union and Eastern European democratic countries.

	As the Cold War eased, the Korean War stopped, and the hope for lasting peace increased year by year due to the great efforts of the Soviet Union, socialist China, and other socialist and peace-loving countries, the people of our country, under the influence of our party's constant propaganda, began to see that establishing bases for a military aggressor country might become a source of insecurity for our future life. The increasing trade with the Soviet Union and democratic countries gave our country new hope for favorable development in terms of exports, and the growing resentment among our people towards living with foreign troops also increased. All of this, coupled with the increasing contradictions, prompted one of the ruling parties to take a public stand against the continued occupation to cope with this spring's new elections. In the past few years, the United Socialist Party has been constantly fighting to mobilize public opinion against the American base policy. Our party has used the rapidly worsening financial instability and high prices to conduct the struggle. In the election campaign, our party further expanded its program and formed an alliance with a faction of the Social Democratic Party. At the last parliamentary session, a proposal by the progressive ruling party was passed, with only the conservatives expressing opposition. Parliament hopes to revise the defense treaty with the United States to completely withdraw foreign troops in peacetime. The election campaign was actually a struggle around the military base issue, which was raised on the conservatives' program. Indeed, all parties except our party united to conduct fierce anti-communist propaganda and frantically scold the so-called bad guys on the other side of the Iron Curtain.

	The results of the election were clear. Revision of the defense treaty is inevitable. Among the parties opposing foreign bases, our party received the most votes. The other two parties, on the one hand, constrained by their campaign platforms and parliamentary resolutions, and on the other hand, obligated to oppose the North Atlantic Group, could not avoid their fate and had to join us in establishing a government against foreign bases. Our party's two ministers manage trade, fisheries, shipping, and social welfare.

	Now, comrades from all countries will ask: What happens next? Our coalition government is built on two major pillars: the withdrawal of foreign troops and maintaining our financial stability. On the Icelandic side, negotiations on revising the joint defense treaty were scheduled to begin on August 1. If no agreement can be reached on revising the treaty before February 1, 1957, the joint defense treaty will automatically expire, and the troops must be withdrawn within one year. However, the date and location for starting negotiations have not yet been decided. At present, the government is carrying out another major task: finding ways to maintain financial and commercial stability so that our exports can develop favorably. Solving this problem is the work of the entire government. But the work of us socialists is also to strive to break free from the imperialists' control over our economic life, because we know that if we can find a way out of the economic problems, it will inevitably make the struggle to expel foreign troops easier. But even if we can find such a way out, we still need to overcome the great hostility of our coalition government allies towards communism.

	Chinese Comrades!

	In your great construction work, you have pointed out the path of cooperation. Now you are cooperating as the stronger party, which was not common before. In the past, we, as the weaker party, had to push things forward gradually through cooperation. Our cooperative efforts often failed. We may fail this time as well. But domestic conditions and the international environment in our country compel us to seize this opportunity. If we succeed, we will make considerable progress on the road to socialism. If we fail, it will undeniably hinder this progress.

	Finally, Chinese Comrades!

	I anticipate that you will ask what kind of contact can be made between this smallest nation and this largest nation in the near future? The long distance and the disparity in production capacity reduce trade opportunities. But I noticed that when Iceland was first settled, China had already invented printing. About two hundred and fifty years later, Icelandic writers began to write books. In the following centuries, ancient Icelandic literature flourished. In recent centuries, we have had valuable and diverse literature. Last year, one of our writers received the Nobel Prize in Literature. The quickest way for our two nations to connect may be through cultural exchange. Many of our best works have translations in languages ​​that Chinese scholars can master. Of course, if Peking University hires an Icelandic language professor, then he will be the most effective translator. On our side, Icelandic students may come here to study Chinese, and in the future, after returning home, they will make us increasingly interested in your culture.

	We, the representatives from the smallest country to attend your Eighth Congress, express our sincere congratulations to you and wish you a victorious advance on the road to socialism. We hope that Iceland and China will have more frequent friendly exchanges in the future.

	We, on behalf of the "Icelandic United Socialist Party," guarantee to do our best to eliminate the influence of imperialism in our country so that free and independent people can build a life in the spirit of peace and socialism in the future.

	Long live the cooperation of peace-loving people in all countries around the world!

### 冰岛统一社会党代表团团长格德门森同志致词

    冰岛统一社会党代表团团长格德门森同志致词亲爱的同志们：
    我代表冰岛统一社会党向中国共产党中央委员会致真诚的谢意，感谢你们友好的邀请，列席你们党的第八次代表大会，并且在这里，中国的首都，受到你们的殷勤的接待。我们一共三个同志，被推派来担任这次有意义的长途旅行的任务，对于这次意外的机会感到非常的高兴，因为我们可以借此了解你们这个美丽、富饶和幅员广大的国家，可以亲自同参加了你们的解放斗争和伟大的建设工作的人们接触。我们也因为能够和其他许多国家的同志们会晤这样难得的机会感到高兴。
    我们这三个同志是一个很小的民族的代表，这个民族过去一直生活在一个偏僻而遥远的国家，因此，我认为需要讲几句关于我国人民和我们家乡的话。
    在很远很远的地方，几乎正好同中国相对地在地球的另一面，在紧靠着北极圈的地方，有一个多山的岛屿。在这个山陵起伏的岛屿上，世界上最小的一个民族，为了争取自己的生存，一千多年以来，一直在和火山的爆发、流动的北极冰山以及狂风暴雪进行斗争。我们的祖先，在大陆上为了逃避一个侵入的暴君的压迫，驾驶着船只，来到这个偏僻的、没有人迹的、岩石累累的岛屿，想找一个地方过自由而独立的家庭生活。他们在这个新的地方没有住多久，就感到需要建立一个共和国，为居民制订法律，建立了欧洲的第一个立法议会。大概有四百年的时间，这些为数不多的居民，一直维持着自己的独立和主权。后来，由于统治阶级内部发生了倾轧和争斗，致使国家的主权落到了外国君主的手里。这个国家于是渐渐成了殖民地，几乎达七百年之久，一直到十二年前，才第一次宣布主权属于我国议会，并得到其他国家的承认。在这以前的二十五年，全国人民争取独立的斗争实际上已经停止，因为当时统治者批准了一个条约，给予我们在二十五年期满时建立共和国的权利。
    一九一八年以后，冰岛的政治生活采取了和当时其他国家相类似的形式。劳动人民的阶级意识已经觉醒。分散的工会联合起来了，它们争取提高生活水平的斗争很快就发展成为政治性的阶级斗争。劳工的第一个政党是社会民主党。但是劳工当中的激进主义倾向越来越强烈，于是在一九三○年成立了共产党。七年以后，共产党在议会中取得了三个席位。此后，相当大一部分社会民主党员同共产党人联合起来，建立了“统一社会党”。这一联合成功的新的政党，影响迅速地增长，在一九四二年就在议会选举中获得了百分之二十的选票，两年以后就在联合政府中占有两个部长的职位。
    在上次世界大战当中，英国借口法西斯军队可能在我国登陆，而在我国驻军。我们对这一占领正式提出了抗议。但是，后来我们的政府同当时仍然是中立的美国协商，允许美国军队接管防务。“统一社会党”在议会中反对批准这一条约，尽管这个条约本身保证在战争结束之后，美国军队立即全部撤退。然而，在战争结束之后，美国不仅没有撤退，反而企图立即要求设立永久的军事基地。由于当时在政府中占有部长职位的
  “统一社会党”的努力，议会一致通过拒绝让这些军队在和平时期驻在我国。一年以后，举行了新的选举。那时，除了我们一个党以外，所有的政党都联合起来，进行疯狂的反共活动，企图使我们完全孤立，同时美国又逐渐地取得了我们过去已经撤回的许诺。新的和后来历届联合政府，不顾“统一社会党”的不断反对，先后同意接受
  “马歇尔援助”，参加“北大西洋集团”，一九五一年，又以在德国的冷战和朝鲜的热战为口实，新的美军部队在我国登陆。在我们的海岸地区建立了雷达网；大规模的基地建设工程，使我们的财政预算中的非生产美元支出过分庞大，影响了我们人民的生活。我们大西洋联盟中的盟国，不愿意开放它们的市场，容纳我们的出口产品，因此甚至一个反动的政府也不得不转而同苏联和东欧民主国家进行大宗的贸易。
    冷战缓和下来，朝鲜战争停下来，持久和平的希望由于苏联、社会主义的中国以及其他社会主义与和平国家的巨大努力，一年比一年增加，这时候，我国人民在我们党不断宣传的影响之下，开始看到，建立基地供一个军事侵略国家使用，可能成为我国未来生活的不安全的根源。同苏联以及各民主国家的贸易往来日益增加，使我国有了新的希望在出口产品方面朝有利的方向发展，同时我国越来越多的人憎恶同外国军队相处的情绪也在日益增长。所有这些，再加上日益增加的各种矛盾，促使执政党之一采取公开反对继续占领的立场来应付今年春天的新选举。过去几年，统一社会党不断地进行斗争来发动舆论反对美国的建立基地的政策。我们党利用迅速加剧的财政不稳的状况和物价高涨来进行斗争。在选举运动中，我们党进一步扩大了自己的纲领，同社会民主党的一派结成联盟。在上一次的议会会议上，进步的执政党的一项建议得到通过，只有保守分子表示反对。议会希望修改同美国订立的防御条约，以便在和平时期完全撤退外国军队。选举运动实际上是环绕着军事基地问题进行斗争的，这个问题是保守分子提到纲领上的。的确，除我们党之外，所有的政党都联合起来进行猛烈的反共宣传，并且疯狂地谩骂所谓铁幕那边的坏人。
    选举的结果很明显。修改防御条约是不可避免的了。在反对外国基地的政党中，我们党所得的选票最多。其他两个政党，一方面由于它们的竞选纲领和议会的决议的约束，另一方面由于它们有反对北大西洋集团的义务，因而不能避免它们的命运，不得不同我们一起来建立一个反对外
  国基地的政府。我们党的两个部长管理贸易、渔业、航运和社会福利事业。
      现在，从各国来的同志们会问：以后怎么办呢？我国联合政府是依靠两大支柱而建立的，那就是撤退外国军队和保持我国财政稳定。在冰岛方面，修改共同防御条约的谈判规定在八月一日开始。如果在一九五七年二月一日之前，对于修改条约还不能取得协议，共同防御条约就自动失效，军队就必须在一年内撤出。但是开始谈判的
  日期和地点还没有决定。在目前，政府正在执行另一项重大的任务，寻找保持财政和商业稳定的办法，使得我国出口商品向有利方面发展。要解决这个问题是整个政府的工作。但是我们社会主义者的工作同样是要努力挣脱帝国主义者对我们经济生活的控制，因为我们深知如果能够找到解决经济问题的出路，就必然使得驱逐外国驻军的斗争比较容易。但是即使我们能够找到这样一个出路，我们仍旧需要克服我们联合政府盟友对共产主义的极大的敌意。
    中国同志们！
    在你们的伟大的建设工作中，你们已经指出了合作的道路。现在你们是作为强大的一方在进行合作，这不是以前所常有的。在过去，我们作为弱小的一方进行合作，不得不把事情逐渐向前推进。我们的合作的努力常常失败。这一次我们或许也会失败。但是我国国内条件和国际环境，使我们不得不抓住这个机会。如果我们成功，就会在走向社会主义道路上有相当的进展。如果失败，不可否认，一定会阻挠这种进展。
    最后，中国同志们！
    我预料你们会问，在最近的将来，在这最小的民族和这最大的民族之间，能够进行怎么样的联系呢？由于距离远，生产能力悬殊，使得贸易的机会减少。但是我注意到，冰岛第一次有移民定居的时候，中国已经发明了印刷术。大约在二百五十年以后，冰岛作家才开始著书。在后来的几个世纪中，古代的冰岛文学繁荣起来。在最近几百年来，我们有了很有价值的多样的文学。去年我们的一个作家得到了诺贝尔文学奖金。我们两个民族进行联系的最快捷的途径可能是文化交流。我们许多最优秀的著作都有中国学者所能掌握的文字的译本。当然，北京大学如果聘请一位冰岛语文教授，那末他将是最有效的通译。在我们一方面，冰岛学生可能到这里来学习中文，将来回国以后将使我们对你们的文化越来越感到兴趣。
    我们，从最小的国家来参加你们第八次代表大会的代表，向你们表达诚挚的祝贺，祝你们在社会主义的道路上胜利地迈进。我们希望冰岛和中国今后将有越来越频繁的友好往来。
    我们代表“冰岛统一社会党”保证要尽我们的力量消除我国国内帝国主义的影响，以便自由和独立的人民将来能够在和平和社会主义的精神下建设生活。
    全世界各国和平人民的合作万岁！（附图片）
