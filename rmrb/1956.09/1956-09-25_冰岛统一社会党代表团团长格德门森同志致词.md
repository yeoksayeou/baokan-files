Dear Comrades,

	On behalf of the Icelandic United Socialist Party, I extend sincere thanks to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China for your kind invitation to attend your Party's Eighth Congress and for the warm reception we have received here in Beijing, the capital of China. The three comrades delegated to undertake this meaningful long journey are very pleased with this unexpected opportunity to learn about your beautiful, rich, and vast country and to personally connect with the people who participated in your liberation struggle and great construction work. We are also delighted by the rare opportunity to meet with comrades from many other countries.

	We three comrades represent a very small nation that has long lived in a remote and distant country. Therefore, I think it is necessary to say a few words about our people and our homeland.

	Far, far away, almost directly opposite China on the other side of the globe, close to the Arctic Circle, lies a mountainous island. On this hilly island, the world's smallest nation has been fighting for its survival for over a thousand years, battling volcanic eruptions, drifting Arctic icebergs, and fierce wind and snow. Our ancestors, fleeing the oppression of an invading tyrant on the mainland, sailed to this remote, uninhabited, and rocky island, seeking a place to live a free and independent family life. They had not lived in this new place for long before they felt the need to establish a republic, enact laws for the residents, and establish Europe's first legislative parliament. For about four hundred years, these few residents maintained their independence and sovereignty. Later, due to internal strife and conflicts within the ruling class, the country's sovereignty fell into the hands of foreign monarchs. The country gradually became a colony for almost seven hundred years until, twelve years ago, it first declared sovereignty to belong to our parliament and was recognized by other countries. In the previous twenty-five years, the national struggle for independence had virtually ceased because the rulers at the time approved a treaty granting us the right to establish a republic when the twenty-five-year term expired.

	After 1918, Iceland's political life took on a form similar to that of other countries at the time. The working people's class consciousness had awakened. Dispersed trade unions united, and their struggle to improve living standards quickly developed into a political class struggle. The first political party of labor was the Social Democratic Party. However, the radical tendency among the workers grew stronger, and the Communist Party was founded in 1930. Seven years later, the Communist Party won three seats in parliament. Subsequently, a considerable number of Social Democrats joined forces with the Communists to establish the "United Socialist Party." This successful new party grew rapidly in influence, winning 20 percent of the vote in the parliamentary elections of 1942, and two ministerial positions in the coalition government two years later.

	During the last World War, Britain occupied our country under the pretext that fascist forces might land in our country. We formally protested this occupation. However, later, our government consulted with the United States, which was still neutral at the time, and allowed American troops to take over the defense. The "United Socialist Party" opposed the ratification of this treaty in parliament, even though the treaty itself guaranteed that American troops would be immediately and completely withdrawn after the end of the war. However, after the end of the war, the United States not only did not withdraw but attempted to immediately demand the establishment of permanent military bases. Thanks to the efforts of the "United Socialist Party," which held ministerial positions in the government at the time, the parliament unanimously passed a resolution refusing to allow these troops to be stationed in our country during peacetime. A year later, new elections were held. At that time, all parties except our party united to conduct a frantic anti-communist campaign, attempting to completely isolate us, while the United States gradually obtained the promises we had previously withdrawn. The new and subsequent coalition governments, despite the constant opposition of the "United Socialist Party," successively agreed to accept "Marshall Aid" and participate in the "North Atlantic Group." In 1951, using the Cold War in Germany and the hot war in Korea as excuses, new American troops landed in our country. A radar network was established in our coastal areas; large-scale base construction projects made the non-productive dollar expenditure in our financial budget excessively large, affecting the lives of our people. Our allies in the Atlantic Alliance were unwilling to open their markets to accommodate our exports, so even a reactionary government had to turn to conduct large-scale trade with the Soviet Union and Eastern European democratic countries.

	As the Cold War eased, the Korean War stopped, and the hope for lasting peace increased year by year due to the great efforts of the Soviet Union, socialist China, and other socialist and peace-loving countries, the people of our country, under the influence of our party's constant propaganda, began to see that establishing bases for a military aggressor country might become a source of insecurity for our future life. The increasing trade with the Soviet Union and democratic countries gave our country new hope for favorable development in terms of exports, and the growing resentment among our people towards living with foreign troops also increased. All of this, coupled with the increasing contradictions, prompted one of the ruling parties to take a public stand against the continued occupation to cope with this spring's new elections. In the past few years, the United Socialist Party has been constantly fighting to mobilize public opinion against the American base policy. Our party has used the rapidly worsening financial instability and high prices to conduct the struggle. In the election campaign, our party further expanded its program and formed an alliance with a faction of the Social Democratic Party. At the last parliamentary session, a proposal by the progressive ruling party was passed, with only the conservatives expressing opposition. Parliament hopes to revise the defense treaty with the United States to completely withdraw foreign troops in peacetime. The election campaign was actually a struggle around the military base issue, which was raised on the conservatives' program. Indeed, all parties except our party united to conduct fierce anti-communist propaganda and frantically scold the so-called bad guys on the other side of the Iron Curtain.

	The results of the election were clear. Revision of the defense treaty is inevitable. Among the parties opposing foreign bases, our party received the most votes. The other two parties, on the one hand, constrained by their campaign platforms and parliamentary resolutions, and on the other hand, obligated to oppose the North Atlantic Group, could not avoid their fate and had to join us in establishing a government against foreign bases. Our party's two ministers manage trade, fisheries, shipping, and social welfare.

	Now, comrades from all countries will ask: What happens next? Our coalition government is built on two major pillars: the withdrawal of foreign troops and maintaining our financial stability. On the Icelandic side, negotiations on revising the joint defense treaty were scheduled to begin on August 1. If no agreement can be reached on revising the treaty before February 1, 1957, the joint defense treaty will automatically expire, and the troops must be withdrawn within one year. However, the date and location for starting negotiations have not yet been decided. At present, the government is carrying out another major task: finding ways to maintain financial and commercial stability so that our exports can develop favorably. Solving this problem is the work of the entire government. But the work of us socialists is also to strive to break free from the imperialists' control over our economic life, because we know that if we can find a way out of the economic problems, it will inevitably make the struggle to expel foreign troops easier. But even if we can find such a way out, we still need to overcome the great hostility of our coalition government allies towards communism.

	Chinese Comrades!

	In your great construction work, you have pointed out the path of cooperation. Now you are cooperating as the stronger party, which was not common before. In the past, we, as the weaker party, had to push things forward gradually through cooperation. Our cooperative efforts often failed. We may fail this time as well. But domestic conditions and the international environment in our country compel us to seize this opportunity. If we succeed, we will make considerable progress on the road to socialism. If we fail, it will undeniably hinder this progress.

	Finally, Chinese Comrades!

	I anticipate that you will ask what kind of contact can be made between this smallest nation and this largest nation in the near future? The long distance and the disparity in production capacity reduce trade opportunities. But I noticed that when Iceland was first settled, China had already invented printing. About two hundred and fifty years later, Icelandic writers began to write books. In the following centuries, ancient Icelandic literature flourished. In recent centuries, we have had valuable and diverse literature. Last year, one of our writers received the Nobel Prize in Literature. The quickest way for our two nations to connect may be through cultural exchange. Many of our best works have translations in languages ‚Äã‚Äãthat Chinese scholars can master. Of course, if Peking University hires an Icelandic language professor, then he will be the most effective translator. On our side, Icelandic students may come here to study Chinese, and in the future, after returning home, they will make us increasingly interested in your culture.

	We, the representatives from the smallest country to attend your Eighth Congress, express our sincere congratulations to you and wish you a victorious advance on the road to socialism. We hope that Iceland and China will have more frequent friendly exchanges in the future.

	We, on behalf of the "Icelandic United Socialist Party," guarantee to do our best to eliminate the influence of imperialism in our country so that free and independent people can build a life in the spirit of peace and socialism in the future.

	Long live the cooperation of peace-loving people in all countries around the world!
