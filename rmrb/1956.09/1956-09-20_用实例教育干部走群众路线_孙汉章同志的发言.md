    Using Examples to Educate Cadres on the Mass Line
    Speech by Comrade Sun Hanzhang

    The Muma Township Branch in Guiding County, Guizhou Province, used concrete examples of one cooperative's cadres caring about the well-being of the masses and another cooperative's cadres not caring about the well-being of the masses to conduct comparative education for the cadres, making them understand that cooperatives should not only lead members in production but also arrange for the members' lives.

    I completely agree with and firmly support the reports by Comrades Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, and Deng Xiaoping. Now, I would like to talk about a township branch's education of Party members on caring about the well-being of the masses.

    There are two agricultural production cooperatives in Muma Township, Guiding County, Guizhou Province. One is the Jinxing Cooperative, whose cadres care about the well-being of the masses. When they see that members have difficulties in their lives, they hold meetings of the cooperative's management committee to discuss and find ways to solve them. Because they have solved the members' difficulties, everyone is very satisfied with them, and production is very energetic. The other is the Hongguang Cooperative. The cadres of this cooperative are the opposite of those of the Jinxing Cooperative and are indifferent to the difficulties of the masses. For example, some members do not even have money to buy salt, and the cooperative does not care. The members have no choice but to burn lime to sell; however, the cooperative's management committee stipulates that the lime must be managed uniformly by the cooperative and members are not allowed to sell it freely. Once, members of the cooperative, such as Yang Renbin and Sun Zhiqi, were found to be selling three loads of lime and the cooperative confiscated them. Therefore, the members have many opinions about the cooperative's management committee. In order to educate Party members to care about the well-being of the masses, the township branch held a Party rectification meeting in late July this year. At the meeting, it praised the Jinxing Agricultural Cooperative's style of caring about the well-being of its members, and also criticized the Hongguang Agricultural Cooperative's style of being indifferent to the difficulties of its members. Moreover, it used the different styles of the cadres of the two cooperatives to conduct comparative education for the Party members, so that the Party members understood what is good and what is not; what is the mass line and what is commandism.

    After the Party rectification meeting, the township branch also organized township and cooperative cadres, spending three days conducting household visits to all 325 member households of the two agricultural cooperatives. During the visits, it was learned that two households lacked clothing, 122 households lacked oil and salt, 53 households lacked food rations, and 36 households had difficulties with women going to work. During the visits, the members put forward many reasonable demands and criticized the cooperative cadres, saying: "In the past, you only told us to go to work, and if we didn't go to work, you would criticize us and deduct points. You don't care that we have no food to eat, no clothes to wear, and no oil and salt to eat." These criticisms profoundly educated the township and cooperative cadres. Township Head Tang Chaozhang (a member of the Party branch committee) said: "In the past, we only criticized the members for not going to work, and we didn't know that the members had so many difficulties. If these difficulties are not solved, how can they actively produce?"

    After the visits, the township branch conducted serious research and found the reasons for the difficulties. The main reason was that the cooperative cadres only cared about the collective and did not care about the individual, which led to the stagnation of sideline production in the members' families, a significant reduction in scattered income, and no money to buy oil, salt, grain, and other daily necessities, while the income of the agricultural cooperative would not be distributed to the members until the end of the year. The branch believed that this phenomenon was serious and extremely unreasonable. They took the following measures to solve this problem:

    First, they advanced a portion of cash and grain to the members according to the number of workdays they had done, in order to solve their daily needs. The cooperative advanced 1,300 yuan to the 122 households lacking oil and salt; the cooperative advanced 2,480 jin of wheat and 180 yuan in cash to the 53 households lacking food rations; the cooperative advanced 10 yuan to the two households lacking clothes, thus solving their difficulties.

    Second, they left the members with appropriate time to engage in household sideline production, increasing the members' income in many ways. They also took care of women's housework and provided care for women who were unable to work due to pregnancy or illness. Because the members' difficulties were concretely solved, their enthusiasm for production was increased. Now the production of these two cooperatives is better than in the past, and the cooperatives are also more united.

    This matter reminds us that after the realization of cooperativization, the responsibility of the cooperative cadres has increased. They must not only manage the cooperative's production well, but also arrange for the members' lives. However, they have not yet learned the skills to manage the cooperative, and they are not good at following the mass line and caring about the well-being of the masses at all times. Therefore, they work hard, but all they get is the complaints of the masses. An important reason for this situation is that there is bureaucracy in the leadership. When deploying work, some of our leading organs often do not proceed from reality, make excessive or hasty demands, or only assign tasks without explaining policies and methods, and always ask for things from below, rarely giving them specific help. How can this situation not lead to a style of commandism? In fact, this situation is not unique to Muma Township, but is a fairly common problem. Therefore, I believe that the experience of the Muma Township branch in educating Party members and cooperative cadres to care about the well-being of the masses and learn to follow the mass line through examples is very good. At present, it is very necessary for us to conduct a widespread, in-depth, and concentrated education on the mass line among township and cooperative cadres, in order to improve the level of township and cooperative cadres, and to earnestly criticize the bureaucracy in the leadership. This will be of great benefit to promoting the current rural work.

    用实例教育干部走群众路线
    孙汉章同志的发言
    贵州省贵定县木马乡支部通过一个合作社的干部关心群众疾苦，另一个合作社的干部不关心群众疾苦的具体事例，对干部作了对比教育，使他们懂得合作社不但要领导社员生产，而且要安排社员的生活。
    我完全同意刘少奇同志、周恩来同志和邓小平同志的报告并坚决贯彻执行。现在，我想说一个乡支部对党员进行关心群众疾苦的教育问题。
    贵州省贵定县的木马乡有两个农业生产合作社。一个是金星社，这个社的干部关心群众的疾苦。他们看到社员生活上有困难，就开社管会商量，想办法解决。由于解决了社员的困难，所以大家对他们很满意，生产很有劲。另一个是红光社，这个社的干部同金星社恰恰相反，对群众的疾苦漠不关心。例如有的社员连买盐巴的钱都没有，社里也不管。社员没法，只好烧石灰去卖；而社的管委会却规定石灰要由社统一经营，不准社员自由出卖。有一次，该社杨仁斌、孙志奇等社员运三挑石灰去卖，被社里查到没收了。因此，社员对社管委会的意见很多。为了教育党员关心群众疾苦，这个乡的党支部在今年七月下旬开了一次整党会议，会上表扬了金星农业社关心社员疾苦的作风，同时也批判了红光农业社对社员的困难漠不关心的作风。并且，用这两个社的干部的不同作风向党员作了对比教育，使党员明白什么是好的，什么是不好的；那种是群众路线，那种是强迫命令。
    在整党会以后，乡支部又组织乡、社干部，花了三天功夫，对这两个农业社的三百二十五户社员逐户地进行了一次家庭访问。在访问中了解到：有两户缺少衣服，一百二十二户缺少油盐，五十三户缺口粮，三十六户的妇女出工有困难。访问时，社员提出了许多合理的要求，并且批评社干部说：“过去光叫我们出工，不出工就批评，还要扣分。我们没有饭吃，没有衣服穿，没有油盐吃，也不管我们”。这些批评都深刻地教育了乡干部和社干部。乡长唐朝章（党支委）说：“过去光批评社员不出工，还不知道社员有这样多的困难，这些困难不解决，他们怎么能积极生产呢？”
    访问以后，乡支部认真地进行了研究，找出了发生困难的原因，主要是社干部只顾集体、不管个人，以致社员家庭副业生产停顿，零星收入显著减少，没有钱买油盐、粮食和其他生活必需品，而农业社的收入又要到年度终了时才分配给社员。支部认为这种现象是严重的，也是极不合理的。他们采取了下面几项措施来解决这个问题：
    第一，按社员做的劳动日的多少，预支给他们一部分现金和粮食，以解决日常生活的需要。对一百二十二户缺油盐的，社里预支给他们一千三百元；对五十三户缺口粮的，社里预支给他们麦子二千四百八十斤，人民币一百八十元；对两户缺衣服穿的，社里预支给他们十元，解决了困难。
    第二，给社员留出适当的时间搞家庭副业生产，从多方面增加社员的收入。并且照顾了妇女的家务劳动，对因为怀孕或有病不能出工的妇女也作了照顾。由于具体地解决了社员的困难，就提高了他们生产的积极性，现在这两个社的生产都比过去搞得好了，社内也团结了。
    这件事提醒我们：在实现了合作化以后，社干部的责任是加重了，他们不但要管理好社里的生产，而且要安排好社员的生活。但是，他们还没有学会管理合作社的本领，还不善于走群众路线，随时关心群众的疾苦。因此，他们辛苦到头，得来的却是群众的抱怨。形成这种状况的重要原因，还在于领导上有官僚主义。我们的某些领导机关，在布置工作时，常常不从实际出发，要求过高、过急，或者只交代任务，不交代政策和办法，并且总是向下面要东西，很少给他们以具体帮助。这种情况，怎么不产生强迫命令的作风呢？其实这种情形不单是木马乡一个地方的问题，而是带有相当普遍性质的问题。因此，我认为木马乡支部通过实例教育，使党员和社干部关心群众的疾苦，学会走群众路线的经验是非常好的。目前，我们很有必要在乡、社干部中，普遍地、深入地、集中地进行一次群众路线的教育，以提高乡、社干部的水平，并且把领导上的官僚主义认真地反一下，这对于推动当前的农村工作是大有好处的。
