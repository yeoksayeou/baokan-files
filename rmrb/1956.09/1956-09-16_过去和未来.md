Past and Future
    Kang Zhuo
    A fierce storm swept through my heart, stirring up memories and ideals of my entire life. This storm occurred in a region of northern China, rare for its green mountains and clear waters, in a corner bordering the Soviet Union and North Korea. This is the area where the Korean ethnic group of China resides, the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture in Jilin Province. There, more than 500,000 Korean people are shaking the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers, shaking the whole of China, with their abundant rice fields and magnificent dances.

    However, the storm in my heart did not arise from the dances or the rice fields, but from a struggle history of creating abundant rice fields and fascinating dances.

    Exactly half a month ago, in the suburbs of Yanji City, the seat of the Yanbian Autonomous Prefecture People's Committee, I visited a well-known middle-aged woman. This woman is named Jin Xinshu, and she lives in a village called Xiaoying Township. Xiaoying Township is backed by hills surrounded by green pines and verdant grass, and in front of it, the boundless basin stretches into a green sea of rice paddies. Farther ahead, there are continuous mountain peaks decorated with green pines and verdant grass. These are the remaining peaks of the famous Changbai Mountain. At the foot of the remaining peaks, the Hailan River and the Burhatong River flow gently, irrigating the rice fields on both banks, helping the Korean girls wash their white short shirts and colorful long skirts, and then flowing forward into the Tumen River. This area has high and steep mountains, vast plains, and narrow rivers; the villages are like scattered stars, and the population is not very dense. Standing at the entrance of Xiaoying Village and looking around, one feels the vastness of the sea and the sky, and the magnificence of the momentum; one feels that the nourishment of nature is truly inexhaustible, no matter how many people draw from it...

    My companions and I crossed the small stone bridge at the entrance of the village and walked into the main road of Xiaoying Township. We didn't meet anyone in the village. When we arrived at Jin Xinshu's house, the owner was not there either. A girl in a short shirt and long skirt went to find her for us, and our footsteps were drawn to the door of a nearby supply and marketing cooperative.

    What a supply and marketing cooperative's store! The new house and the new counters are very spacious, and various daily necessities are divided into seven or eight sales categories. From farm tools to travel toothbrushes, you can buy anything; the colors of the silk fabrics are woven into rainbows in the sky. After a moment of surprise, we calmed down and were about to pick out some souvenirs from the transparent glass counters when suddenly, behind us, there was a burst of rapid, slightly flustered footsteps, and a series of surprised, slightly apologetic laughter... Jin Xinshu arrived...

    There was a slight sheen of sweat on her forehead, the corners of her eyes were creased into fine patterns, and her hands first grabbed the hand of an acquaintance she hadn't seen for many years among us, and then, just as eagerly, shook hands with everyone. I was holding a working hand that was not very fleshy but simple and powerful. I gazed at this forty-seven-year-old Korean compatriot of mine—her complexion was dark yellow, her forehead was broad, and her chin was slightly pointed; although her sighing laughter revealed the shyness of a rural woman, she exuded an indomitable temperament and robust energy. She was wearing a shirt and a light brown woolen striped skirt, and a pair of shallow-cut, pointed-toe, upturned Korean cloth shoes. Like a thirty-year-old woman, she hurried home, cleaned up the heated kang, invited us to take off our shoes and sit on the kang mat, took a fly swatter to guard against occasional fly harassment, and then sat close to us, talking and laughing endlessly.

    "Don't mind my house being unsightly, many domestic comrades and international friends have all sat here."

    Our translator spoke very fluently. Then she relayed Jin Xinshu's words, saying that it was a pity we came a little late—her son and daughter had just left, otherwise, it would be even more lively!

    It turned out that she had three children. The eldest son was twenty-eight years old and studying at Yanbian University; the second daughter was twenty-six years old and had recently returned from the army and was working in medical services; the youngest son, Jin Zhuyu, was a student at Yanji No. 2 Middle School. Her family should be considered prosperous. And her "unsightly" house was very bright and delicate. It was a typical Korean family's two-room dwelling—the inner room was a clean kitchen and bedroom, and the aged kang mat shone with a dark luster; in the outer guest room, the glass wardrobe was crammed with colorful quilts and clothes, and the snow-white walls around the wardrobe were covered with various commemorative photos and award banners. Jin Xinshu smiled peacefully, explaining the photos of the agricultural cooperative to us, explaining the reason why their cooperative received the "Advanced Management Unit" award banner. And she told us that their advanced agricultural cooperative—the Xinguang Agricultural Cooperative—had a total of two hundred and forty-four households; then, as the director of the cooperative, she introduced the situation in the cooperative to us. However, what we were most concerned about was not these things. I looked at the award banner of "Revolutionary Martyr's Family, Active in Socialist Construction" on the wall, and at a framed, old, yellowed half-length portrait of a man next to this award banner—wearing a not-so-stylish suit, his plump face shining with youthful handsomeness and inexhaustible energy. I guessed who the photo was of, and I was thinking about how to cleverly turn our conversation to this photo as quickly as possible.

    One of the comrades jumped ahead of me. He asked:

    "How old is your third son?"

    Jin Xinshu paused silently for a moment before saying:

    "Fourteen years old... ah!" She smiled bitterly with a sense of resignation, clearly understanding our request. "I know, you want to ask about my husband again. My husband had this third son only after he returned from being away for a long time. We gave him the commemorative name 'Jin Zhuyu,' and he is our last commemoration..."

    In an instant, we all held our breath, staring straight at this female director. She, however, with a somewhat bewildered look in her eyes, gazed from the open doorway at the distant, continuous, high mountains. Then, she pointed to the distant mountains and said in a hushed voice:

    "You all know the Hailan River under that mountain, and you know about the Hailan River Massacre here, right!"

    Several of us visitors exchanged glances. Yes, we all knew the Hailan River. I suddenly felt a signal of a historical storm... It was in 1931, when the Yanbian area had already been occupied by Japanese imperialism and divided into something called "Jiandao Province." But the local people still held a fervent Chinese heart. The Chinese Communist Party secretly established the Eastern Jilin Special Committee there, and Korean laborers gathered around the Party's Special Committee, engaged in armed struggle, killed enemies, and resisted all the tyranny of the enemy. It was truly a time of turbulent winds and raging fires, and the red flags on Changbai Mountain obscured the green pines and grass. The rulers exhausted their efforts, and after many failures, they finally took advantage of the reactionary landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries of the local Korean ethnic group around the "September 18th" Incident that occupied our Northeast, and created a great massacre of the working people on both banks of the Hailan River...

    "During that time, every household of our working people had someone sacrificed. The blood of our comrades flowed into the Hailan River, and the clear river water immediately turned into a crimson color, reflecting the crops and hills on both banks into black."

    Jin Xinshu waved the fly swatter in her hand unconsciously, but I seemed to see her fanning up a historical storm. She didn't look at us at all, and was obviously speaking with a heart full of pain.

    "My husband, Jin Xuejun, was an old Party member and had been organizing armed forces and carrying out the revolution in this area for a long time. But it was in that tragic massacre that he was arrested. However, he was not sacrificed at that time." Jin Xinshu suddenly turned her eyes to us and said, "The Japanese wanted to get information about our Party from his mouth, and they took him to Korea and imprisoned him in Seoul Prison. Wasn't that a waste of effort? What could they get from his mouth?"

    Jin Xinshu revealed a bit of reserved smile. I looked at Jin Xuejun's portrait on the wall, and his eyes were also facing the high and boundless mountains and rivers outside the door, revealing a natural and cheerful smile.

    However, Jin Xuejun was subjected to all kinds of beatings in Seoul Prison, and had been tortured in that dark abyss for ten years. In 1942, the Japanese threw him, a dying man who had not given a single confession, out of the iron walls of the prison.

    He came back. How much he missed the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army in the nearby dense mountains, how much he missed his Party! However, his body was disabled and he could not move. Despite Jin Xinshu's meticulous care, she was unable to save him...

    One day in 1943, he suddenly took out paper, pen, and ink, and asked his wife to stand guard outside. His wife guessed what her husband was going to do again, and couldn't help but say softly, "You've been doing it for so many years, and your body has become like this, and the children at home are almost out of food, and you still..." The husband said, "No! The Party will not forget us. In case I... the Party will help you. You, you go stand guard!"

    While his wife was standing guard, Jin Xuejun endured severe heart disease and the excruciating pain of two left ribs that had been broken in prison, leaned his body against the wall on his right side, padded his legs with a quilt, placed a pot upside down on the quilt, and then spread white paper on the pot, using a pen to write with difficulty. He wrote down the names of the twenty-two counter-revolutionary leaders who manufactured the Hailan River Massacre, and noted who was the main culprit and who was the accomplice. He was very familiar with the massacre, and also wrote down the names of some Communist Party members who were sacrificed at that time and the tragic scenes of their heroic deaths in another piece. After writing, he rolled the paper into a scroll, put it in a black beer bottle, plugged it with a willow cork, sealed it with wax, and handed it to Jin Xinshu.

    "He told me at that time," Jin Xinshu told us, "to hand the bottle over to the Party after liberation. And he told me not to rush to hand it over after liberation, but to find the right person and be sure before handing it over. He also advised me not to cry after he died, saying that in less than three or five years, the world would be ours..."

    Sure enough! In less than three years, the Northeast was liberated. Jin Xinshu also did not rush to hand over the beer bottle. Her husband had died a few days after handing her the bottle. She held back her tears and buried the bottle under the warehouse at home. Later, the Japanese often came to the warehouse to grab grain, and she buried it here and hid it there. For several years, she was worried and scared, and even the slightest rustle of grass in the middle of the night made her think about that bottle. And when it was just liberated, the old bastards were still the village chiefs—those counter-revolutionaries had become "supporters" of the Communist Party, and were secretly planning to kill Jin Xinshu! For a time, Jin Xinshu could not find a reliable person to hand over that precious bottle.

    However, she did not wait. While being vigilant against the counter-revolutionaries, she also fought against the bully village chief who oppressed her, and even fought with him. In 1946, when the land reform work team came to the village and talked to her, she carefully examined them. When the work team visited her for the second time and talked to her until late at night, her stubborn heart suddenly softened involuntarily—she had met real relatives. So, she immediately handed over the bottle... And the comrades of the work team all cried as painfully as she did...

    This was a sad cry, but also a joyous cry. When Jin Xinshu talked about this, I suddenly noticed that the weather in mid-August there was already autumn coolness, and noticed the sun shining on the vast mountains and rivers outside the house. At this time, the sunlight was also bright and dark in bursts, which exactly reflected the true emotions of all of us.

    Jin Xinshu was the first to cheer up. She didn't seem to like to recall the past, and quickly changed the subject, telling us that this year the agricultural cooperative's rice fields could harvest one thousand catties per mu, and that the supply and marketing cooperative's store nearby was the model store in this area. She also talked to us about Beijing, about Changchun, the capital of Jilin Province; she was a representative of the National People's Congress and a representative of the Provincial People's Congress, and she was familiar with Beijing and Changchun, and even familiar with many situations in the whole of China. Finally, she said with emotion:

    "It's really not easy! Thinking about the past and looking at the present... It's a pity that my body is not very good now..."

    She has been engaged in agricultural labor all her life, raising children, and helping her husband; later, she ran to Seoul for her husband and suffered beatings and scoldings from the Japanese. Now, silver threads have appeared in the black hair around her temples...

    "But, for everyone, for future generations, for the days to come," Jin Xinshu said again, "I must do any work well. Now I have to be away for five months of the year for meetings; in the seven months at home, I can't be idle for a day. My husband and I are both Communist Party members!"

    Her words were as majestic as the momentum of the Yanbian Basin. Her words also aroused my memories of the past and my confidence in the future, and suddenly reminded me of the Eighth National Congress of our Party that was about to be held... But I still have some questions about the present. I asked Jin Xinshu:

    "Later, the chief culprits of the Hailan River Massacre..."

    "Ah, later I handed over the bottle, and the government arrested a group of chief culprits. Soon, a 'Hailan River Massacre Revenge Conference' with tens of thousands of people was held in Yanji City, and I was the first to go on stage to accuse them. Seven criminals were shot on the spot, and then, the land reform lit up in every village, and eleven more were dealt with. There are still six left, who have now fled to Seoul; but can they escape the future?"

    We, with a sense of victorious excitement, prepared to say goodbye. One of the comrades suddenly asked the host vaguely:

    "Later, you?"

    Jin Xinshu sent us off, and without giving the question any consideration, she answered directly, saying that she participated in the work of the work team during the land reform and also joined the Party. Later, in order to take care of her convenience in returning home, the government moved her home from the original Zhangjia Village to Xiaoying, which was closer to Yanji City. After the land reform ended, the Party called on farmers to establish mutual aid production groups, but the work was not going smoothly. She returned home and took the lead in organizing mutual aid groups for production, from small groups of five or seven households to today's large cooperative...

    Jin Xinshu talked while sending us off. We repeatedly asked her to go back, but she didn't. Finally, she laughed and said:

    "I'm not sending you off! Our township is holding a sports meeting, I was at the stadium when you came, and now I'm going there again. Won't you go and see?"

    We were all happy and immediately hurried to the stadium with her. There were two volleyball games going on there, and a young man had just spiked a beautiful ball. Outside the court, many men in white clothes and women in various colored silk skirts cheered loudly, and we also applauded and cheered with Jin Xinshu. I saw a strand of black hair and a few silver threads fluttering on her face, which suddenly became innocent. I remembered the scene she had just told me about a few years ago when three students who had joined the army visited her. She told them that when she was in her twenties, she had dug holes under the kang to protect Communist Party members; now the world is different, you must overcome all difficulties and fight for the future. She gave each of the three students a notebook and asked them to write to her...

    There are so many meaningful scenes here! But we had to say a final farewell to the host at the vigorously youthful stadium. I walked out of the village and suddenly remembered that I had forgotten one thing—I hadn't asked about the whereabouts of the list written on that paper and the bottle. A comrade who was with me told me that they were all on display at the Revolutionary History Museum in Harbin. Ah! Those two things are still telling people about the past and inspiring the future at all times... I stood on the stone bridge at the entrance of Xiaoying Village, looking at the vast rivers and mountains, looking at the green pines, green grass, and the sea of rice fields, feeling a thousand thoughts running through my mind; I felt that the nourishment of nature here was inexhaustible, and the storm-like energy of the people here was even more endless.
    
    September 5, 1956, in Beijing.

    过去和未来
    康濯
    一阵剧烈的风暴掠过我的心头，激起了我全部生活的记忆和理想。这阵风暴发生在一个北方少有的山青水绿的地区，发生在紧挨着苏联和朝鲜国境的一个角落。那里是中国境内的朝鲜族聚居的地带，是吉林省的延边朝鲜族自治州。那里五十多万朝鲜族人民，正以稻田的丰产和舞蹈的瑰丽震动着长江黄河，震动着整个的中国。
    不过，我心头的风暴却不是从舞蹈中或稻田里出现，而是从创造丰产的稻田和迷人的舞蹈的一段斗争历史中翻卷起来的。
    整整半个月以前，我在延边自治州人民委员会所在地的延吉市郊，访问了一个远近闻名的中年妇女。这个妇女名叫金信淑，她住的村子叫小营乡。小营乡背枕着青松和碧草环布的山坡，前面无边的盆地伸展成一片稻田的绿海。更遥远的前面，同样又是青松和碧草装饰着的连绵不断的山头。这是有名的长白山的余峰。余峰脚下，海兰江和布尔哈通河轻轻喘息地流着，灌浇着两岸的稻地，帮助朝鲜族姑娘洗净她们白白的短衫和彩色的长裙，然后一直向前，流进图们江里。这一带山岭高而陡，平原辽阔，河流不宽；村庄像疏落的星星，人口也不算稠密。站在小营乡村头四望，只觉着海阔天空，气势雄伟；只觉着自然的养料真是凭你多少人也汲取不完……
    我和同行者迈过村头上石砌的小桥，走进小营乡的村中大道。村里面没有碰见什么人。走到金信淑家，主人也不在。一个短衫长裙的姑娘给我们找人去了，我们的脚步被吸引到了附近一个供销合作社的门市部里边。
    好一个供销社的门市部！新房和新柜台都很宽敞，各种日用百货分成了七八个销售的部类。从农家的用具到旅行牙刷你都可以买到，绸料的颜色更织成了天边的彩虹。我们经过一阵惊讶，平静下来，正想要从透明的玻璃货柜中挑买一点纪念品的时候，忽然身后一阵急促的带点儿慌乱的脚步，一连声惊喜的带点儿抱歉的欢笑……金信淑来了……
    她头上透着轻微的汗渍，眼边笑成了细碎的花纹，一双手首先抓住了我们当中一个她多年不见的熟人的手掌，然后，同样热切地和大家握手。我握住的是一只肌肉并不丰满然而朴质有力的劳动的手。我注视着我的这个四十七岁的朝鲜族的同胞——她面色黑黄，宽额头，下巴有点儿尖削；尽管在她带着喘息的惊叹的笑声中透露着农村妇女的腼腆，但她的身上却处处发散着不屈的气质和健壮的精力。她穿着一件衬衫和一条淡咖啡色的毛料的条纹裙子，一双浅口的尖头翘起的朝鲜族便鞋，像个三十岁的女人似的快步跑回家中，收拾好地炕，招呼我们脱了鞋坐在炕席上，拿过一个蝇拍防备偶然的苍蝇骚扰，随后也就紧靠我们坐下，滔滔不绝地又说又笑起来。
    “别看我这个家不像样，许多国内的同志和国际友人来了，就全都是在这里坐的。”
    我们的翻译口语十分流利。接着又转告我们金信淑的话，说是可惜我们晚来了一步——她的儿子和女儿刚走，要不然，那就更热闹啦！
    原来她有三个儿女。大儿子二十八岁，在延边大学念书；二姑娘二十六岁，不久以前从部队复员回来，参加了医务工作；小儿子金珠玉是延吉第二中学的学生。她这个家应该算是人丁兴旺的。而她这个“不像样”的屋子，却是十分敞亮和精致。是普通朝鲜族家庭的里外两间——里间是洁净的厨房和卧室，陈年的炕席透着深色的亮光；外间客室的玻璃衣橱中，花彩的被毯和衣物挤得满满荡荡，衣橱周围的雪白的墙壁，挂满了各种纪念照片和奖旗。金信淑平和地笑着，给我们解释关于农业社的照片，解释他们的社得到“经营管理先进生产单位”奖旗的缘由。并且告诉我们，他们这个全乡的高级社——新光农业社一共二百四十四户；接着就以社长的身份，向我们介绍社里的情形。然而，我们最关心的还不是这些。我看着墙头“革命烈士家属社会主义建设积极分子”的奖旗，看着这幅奖旗旁边一帧陈旧发黄的男人半身像——穿着不太修饰的西服，胖胖的大脸庞上闪发着青年英俊之气和精力不尽的光辉。我猜得着这是谁的照片，我在想着要怎样巧妙地把我们的谈话赶快转到这张照片上头。
    有一个同志抢到了我的前面。他问道：
    “你的三儿子有多大啦？”
    金信淑默默地停了片刻，才说：
    “十四岁……啊！”她带着不得已的神情苦笑了一下，显然是体会到了我们的要求。“我知道，你们又是想要问我爱人的事。我爱人是长期在外回来以后，才有了这第三个儿子的。我们给他取了个纪念的名字‘金珠玉’，他也就是我们夫妇的最后的纪念……”
    刹时间我们都摒住了声息，直望着这个女社长。她却带着点儿迷惘的眼色，从敞开的屋门注视着远处连绵高峻的山头。然后，她手指着远山，噤声低语地说：
    “你们是都知道那山下边的海兰江，知道咱们这里海兰江血案的吧！”
    我们几个访问者互相对望了一眼。是的，我们都知道海兰江。我更突然地感到了一场历史风暴的讯号……那是在1931年，当时延边地区早已被日本帝国主义占领，划成了一个什么“间岛省”。但当地人民却依然怀着一颗中国人的热切的心。中国共产党在那里秘密建立了吉林东部特别委员会，朝鲜族的劳动者齐集到党的特委的周围，搞武装，杀敌人，反抗敌人的一切暴政。那真是风云起伏，大火燎原，长白山上的红旗遮没了青松和绿草。统治者费尽心机，经过了许多失败，最后竟在占领我国东北的“九一八”事变前后，利用当地朝鲜族的反动地主、富农和反革命分子，在海兰江两岸制造了一场对劳动人民的大屠杀……
    “那一阵，我们劳动人民真是家家户户都有人牺牲，我们同志的血流到海兰江，清清的江水立时都变成了一片鲜红，把两岸的庄稼和山坡也给映成了黑色。”
    金信淑无意地挥动着手中的蝇拍，我却好像看见她扇起了一场历史的暴风。她根本不望我们一眼，显然是满怀创痛地说着。
    “我的爱人金学俊是老党员，早就在这一带组织武装，进行革命。可也就是在那个惨案里，他被捕了。不过他当时没有牺牲。”金信淑忽然间转眼对我们望了一下，又说，“日本人想从他的嘴里得到我们党的情况，把他解到朝鲜，关进汉城监狱。那不是白费么？从他的嘴里还能得到什么东西么？”
    金信淑露出了点儿含蓄的笑意。我看了看墙上金学俊的像片，他的眼睛也正对着门外高阔无边的山河，透现着自然的开朗的笑意。
    不过，金学俊当时却在汉城监狱遭尽了毒打，并且一直在那个黑暗的深渊里被折磨了十年。1942年，日本人才把他这个没有一句口供的快死的人扔出了监牢的铁壁。
    他回来了。他多么想念不远处茂林深山中的东北抗日联军，多么想念自己的党！可是，身子成了残废，不能动。尽管金信淑百般细致的照顾，也没有能够挽救他……
    1943年的一天，他忽然拿出了纸笔和墨水，并叫妻子出去放哨。妻子猜到丈夫又是要干什么工作了，不禁心软地说：“你干了那么些年，眼看身子都成了这样，家里孩子们也快要没有吃的，你还……”丈夫说：“不！党不会忘了我们，万一我……党也会帮助你的。你，你站岗去！”
    就在妻子站岗的时候，金学俊忍受着严重的心脏病和在监狱被打坏的两条左肋骨的剧痛，把身子向右靠在墙头，腿上垫了被子，被子上反扣着一个锅盆，然后在锅盆上铺好白纸，用钢笔费劲地写着。他写下了制造海兰江血案的二十二个反革命头子的名字，并且给那些人注明了谁是首恶，谁是胁从。他对那件血案十分了解，同时并在另外的篇幅里写下了当时牺牲的一些共产党员的名字和他们英勇就义的悲壮情景。写好以后，把纸卷成卷儿，装进一个黑色的啤酒瓶中，塞上柳木塞，用蜡封住，交给了金信淑。
    “他那时告诉我，”金信淑对我们说，“等解放以后把瓶子交给党。又告诉我，解放后也不要急着交，要看准了人，有了把握再交。他还劝我，让我在他死后不要哭，说是等不了三五年，天下就会是我们的……”
    果然！不到三年，东北解放。金信淑也果然没有急着交出啤酒瓶。她丈夫是在交给她瓶子以后不几天就去世的。她忍着眼泪，把瓶子埋在家里的仓库底下。后来日本人经常到仓库抢粮，她就这里埋那里藏，几年来提心吊胆，半夜风吹草动，都要眼睁睁想着那只瓶子。而刚刚解放的时候，却依然是过去的坏蛋当了乡长——那些反革命分子竟变成了共产党的“拥护者”，并且还暗中计划要杀害金信淑！她金信淑一时竟找不到交出那只宝贝瓶子的可靠的人。
    不过，她没有等待。她一面警惕着反革命分子，却也同欺压她的恶霸乡长进行过斗争，还动手打过一架。到1946年，土地改革工作队下了乡，找她谈话，她也就细致地考察着人家。工作队第二次访问她，同她谈到深夜，她那颗倔强的心突然间不由自主地一软——她见到了真正的亲人。于是，马上交出了瓶子……而工作队的同志，一个个都跟她一样地痛哭起来……
    这是悲伤的痛哭，也是欢愉的痛哭。当金信淑讲到这里的时候，我忽然注意到那里8月中旬就已是秋凉的天气，注意到屋外那照耀着广阔山河的太阳。太阳光这时候也是一阵明一阵暗，恰恰反映了我们大家的真实的情绪。
    是金信淑最先开朗起来。她好像不大喜欢回忆过去，很快就换了谈话的题目，告诉我们今年这里农业社的稻田每亩可以收获一千斤，而附近那个供销社的门市部是这一带的模范门市部。她并且又同我们谈到北京、谈到吉林的省会长春；她是全国人民代表大会代表和省人民代表大会代表，她熟悉北京和长春，甚至也熟悉全中国的许多情况。终于她又满怀着感慨，说道：
    “真不容易啊！想想过去，看看现在……可惜我现在身体不太好……”
    她一辈子从事农业劳动，养育儿女，帮助丈夫；后来又为丈夫奔跑汉城，遭受日本人的打骂。现在她鬓边的黑发里已经出现了银丝……
    “可是，为了大家，为了后代，为了以后的日子，”金信淑又说，“我是不论什么工作都一定要做好。现在我一年总要在外边开五个月的会；在家里的七个月，我总一天也不能闲着。我和我爱人都是共产党员呀！”
    她的话和延边盆地的气势一样雄伟。她的话也激起了我对于过去的记忆和对于未来的信心，并且还突然地使我想起了我们党就要召开的第八次全国代表大会……但我对现在还有点儿疑问。我问金信淑：
    “后来那些海兰江血案的凶首……”
    “啊，后来我交出了瓶子，政府就抓住了一批凶首。不久，在延吉市召开了一个几万人的“海兰江血案复仇大会”，我头一个上台控诉。当场就枪毙了七个罪犯，跟着，土地改革就在村村点起了火，就又处理了十一个。还剩下六个，现在逃到了汉城；可是，他们能逃得过将来么？”
    我们带着胜利的感奋的心情，准备告别。有一个同志忽然不明不白地问着主人：
    “后来你呢？”
    金信淑送着我们，同时并没对问题加以任何考虑，就径直回答着，说她在土改当中参加了工作队的工作，也参加了党。后来政府为了照顾她回家的方便，把她的家从原来的张家屯搬到了靠近延吉市的小营。土改结束以后，党号召农民成立生产互助组，可是工作进行的并不顺利。她就回到家里带头组织互助组的生产，从五户、七户的小组，直发展到今天的大社……
    金信淑一边说话，一边送我们。我们再三请她回去，她不。最后她才笑道：
    “我不是送你们！我们乡正在开运动会，你们来的时候我就在运动场上，现在我还要上那里去。你们不去看看么？”
    我们都高兴起来，马上同她赶到运动场上。那里正在进行两场排球比赛，有一个小伙子刚刚扣了一个漂亮的球。球场外许多白衣的男人和各种彩色绸裙的妇女大声叫好，我们也和金信淑一同鼓掌叫好。我看见在她那忽然变得天真的脸上，飘动着一绺黑发和几根银丝。我想起了她刚才讲过的几年前三个参军的学生访问她的情景。她告诉人家，说她二十来岁的时候就在炕底下挖洞掩护共产党员；现在天下不同了，你们要克服一切困难，为未来而斗争。她送了三个学生一人一个笔记本，并让他们给她写信……
    这里有着多少意味深长的场面！但是，我们不能不在青春旺盛的运动场上最后告别主人。我走到村外，忽然想起忘了一件事——没有问问那张纸写的名单和那个瓶子的下落。同行的一个同志告诉我，说是那都在哈尔滨的革命历史博物馆陈列着。啊！那两件东西还在时时刻刻向人们讲说着过去，启示着未来……我站在小营乡村头的石桥上，望着广阔的河山，望着青松、绿草和稻田的海，真是千头万绪；我觉着这里自然的养料固然是汲取不尽，而这里人们的风暴一般的精力却更是无穷无尽的。
            1956年9月5日于北京。
