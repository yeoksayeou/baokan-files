    Using Leaves and Weeds as Poison Bait
    Many regions often use grain mixed with pesticide as poison grain or poison bait when controlling underground pests such as mole crickets and cutworms. This is very uneconomical.
    In order to overcome this shortcoming, the Agricultural Technology Extension Station of the vegetable garden area in Tangyin County, Henan Province, used locust or elm leaves instead of grain (four catties of crushed leaves mixed with three taels of 6% BHC powder, plus a little water). They opened ditches along the crops and scattered the mixture in the ground, and the effect of controlling cutworms reached about 80%. In agricultural cooperatives in Shijing, Shishan, and Guanqiao in Fujian, three catties of weeds, vegetable leaves, or pine and cypress branches were mixed with sesame oil (about one or two taels) per mu of land, and then mixed with one catty of 0.5% BHC powder. Before sowing, they were scattered in the ground to lure and kill mole crickets, and the effect was very good. Land that has been treated for underground pests using this method can ensure a full stand of seedlings after sowing.
    Many regions will soon begin autumn sowing. Regions with underground pests may wish to try these methods to control underground pests. Zhao Ji

    用树叶、杂草作毒饵
    许多地区在防治蝼蛄、地老虎等地下害虫的时候，常用粮食拌药作毒谷、毒饵。这样作很不经济。
    为了克服这个缺点，河南汤阴县菜园区农业技术推广站用槐树或榆树叶代替粮食（用四斤碎叶和三两6％六六六粉，加上少许清水拌匀），沿着庄稼附近开沟撒在地里，防治地老虎的效果达到80％左右。福建石井、诗山、官桥等地的农业社，每亩地用三斤杂草、菜叶或松柏枝，先拌上香油（约一两），再合上一斤0.5％六六六粉，在没有播种以前撒在地里，诱杀蝼蛄，效果很好。用这种方法除治过地下害虫的地，在播种后可以保住全苗。
    许多地区快要秋播了。有地下害虫的地区，不妨试用这些办法来防治地下害虫。　赵集
