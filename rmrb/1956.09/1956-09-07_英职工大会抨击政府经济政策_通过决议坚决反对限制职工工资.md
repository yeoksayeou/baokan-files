Xinhua News Agency, Brighton, September 6th: The British Trades Union Congress (TUC), meeting in Brighton, rejected the Conservative government's demands for wage restrictions at its meeting on the 5th, and sharply criticized the government's economic policies. The congress unanimously passed a resolution on the British economic situation amidst cheers. The resolution stated that the congress recognized serious weaknesses in the British national economy and believed that the government was largely responsible for the recent inflationary trends because it failed to maintain and improve export trade. The resolution also condemned the government's laissez-faire economic policies.

The resolution emphasized that workers have the right to negotiate with capitalists on equal terms and have the right to use bargaining power to protect workers from economic imbalances. It rejected the government's proposals to restrict wages.

The resolution criticized the government's "anti-inflation" policies. It warned that relying primarily on financial controls would not only fail to increase production, but would inevitably cause market anomalies and harm large sectors of industry. In such a dangerous situation, technological developments, including automation, would inevitably increase unemployment.

The resolution believes that implementing the "planned economy" advocated by the Labour Party could guarantee employment and maintain workers' living standards, and therefore instructs the TUC General Council to recommend to the government again to re-implement "planned economy" and implement price controls. At the meeting that day, the congress also elected the General Council. All thirty-five members of the previous session were re-elected.

Xinhua News Agency, September 5th: Brighton News: At the meeting on September 4th, over a thousand delegates attending the 88th annual conference of the British Trades Union Congress unanimously passed two resolutions, one resolution demanding a shortening of compulsory military service and urging the government to achieve disarmament through the United Nations, and the other resolution demanding that safeguards be taken to deal with employers' actions to combat labor by using production "automation."

    英职工大会抨击政府经济政策
    通过决议坚决反对限制职工工资
    据新华社布莱顿6日电　在布莱顿召开的英国职工大会在5日会议上拒绝了保守党政府限制工资的要求，同时尖锐地抨击了政府的经济政策。大会在欢呼声中一致通过了关于英国经济情况的决议。这个决议说，大会认识到英国国民经济有严重的弱点，它认为政府在很大程度上应对最近通货膨胀的趋势负责，因为它不能保持和改善出口贸易。决议还谴责政府对经济采取放任政策。
    决议着重指出，工人有权同资本家在平等条件下谈判，并且有权运用讨价还价的力量来保护工人免受经济失调之害。它拒绝了政府关于限制工资的建议。
    决议批评政府的“反通货膨胀”政策。它警告说：把主要的依靠放在金融管制上不但不能增加生产，反而不可避免地要引起市场的反常和使广大工业部门受到损害。在这种危险情况下，包括自动化在内的技术发展一定会使失业人数增加。
    决议认为，实行工党所主张的“计划经济”就可以保证就业和维护工人生活水平，因此责成职工大会最高委员会再次建议政府重新实行“计划经济”，实行物价管制。在这一天的会议上，大会还选出了最高委员会。上届的三十五个委员全部重新当选。
    据新华社5日讯　布莱顿消息：出席英国职工大会八十八届年会的一千多个代表在9月4日的会议上，一致通过了两项决议，一项决议是要求缩短义务兵役期限、敦促政府通过联合国实现裁军，另一项决议要求采取保障措施来对付雇主利用生产“自动化”来打击劳工的行动。
