An Example of Changing Customs
Yi Qin

Recently, a gratifying new atmosphere has emerged in the Qitang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Baise County, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Prefecture. The cooperative has achieved a reasonable division of household labor between male and female members. Now, every day at sunset, after returning from the fields, male members fetch water with buckets and take corn to the mill, while female members start the fire to cook, feed the pigs, and then everyone eats dinner together, rests, and participates in recreational activities or studies. In Zhuzhou Village, all twenty-six households have achieved a division of household labor between men and women.

Perhaps some people think that these are just "trivial household matters," and that they are not worthy of attention. But this is not the case. This practice of men and women reasonably sharing household labor not only enables women to participate more effectively in agricultural labor after reducing their heavy household burdens and protects the health of women and children, but also plays a role in changing customs.

Hasn't the custom of "women doing all the housework" been circulating in China for thousands of years? In rural areas, women have to bear the heavy burden of cooking, washing clothes, chopping firewood, taking care of children, sewing clothes and shoes, grinding grain, cutting pig feed, and tending vegetable gardens. Therefore, some women who have given birth to too many children are often exhausted and suffer from back pain, and some even suffer from lifelong illnesses. What about the men? After returning from the fields, they "don't even bother to pick up an overturned oil bottle." They expect to be fed and clothed, and even want their wives to fetch their "foot-washing water." This is obviously an unreasonable and unfair phenomenon. Although women inevitably have to bear more household labor than men in rural areas, since the family is the basis for the common life of both husband and wife, both men and women should be responsible for all household labor related to daily family life. Especially now, when many women have to participate in agricultural labor and do all the housework, their daily working hours often extend to twelve or even fourteen hours, which not only damages women's health but also affects the education and protection of children. This is all the more unreasonable. The Qitang Agricultural Production Cooperative has changed this custom, demonstrating their bold spirit of innovation.

Since it is a matter of "changing customs," it will inevitably encounter resistance from habitual forces, and there will be a struggle between new and old ideas. Aren't there such opinions in many places now? Some elderly people believe that this is: "Rules passed down from generation to generation cannot be broken," and some young and middle-aged people believe that men doing housework is "being afraid of their wives" and "not glorious." Therefore, to make these people realize that these "rules" should and can be broken, and to realize that it is reasonable and glorious for men to share some household labor, some ideological education work must be done. The Qitang Agricultural Production Cooperative Party Branch, precisely because it recognized this point, first conducted education on the importance of protecting the health of women and children among party members, criticized various incorrect ideas, and then production team leader Su Caisong and others introduced to everyone the benefits of sharing household labor with their wives. This kind of education, which was both reasonable and based on vivid facts, made the male members feel that it was "reasonable," and one by one, they helped the female members share the household labor.

This practice of changing customs is worth promoting.

    移风易俗的一例
    宜勤
    最近，桂西僮族自治州百色县七塘农业生产合作社里，出现了令人可喜的新气象，这个社做到了男女社员合理分担家务劳动。现在，每天夕阳西下，他们从田里回来以后，男社员就纷纷担着水桶去挑水、拿了玉米上磨房，女社员在家起火做饭、喂猪，然后一起吃晚饭、休息、参加文娱活动或学习。竹州屯上二十六户人家，已经户户做到男女分担家务了。
    或许有人认为：这不过是一些“家务琐事”，有什么值得注意的呢？其实不然。这种男女合理分担家务劳动的做法，不但使妇女在减少过重的家务劳动以后，可以更出色地参加农业劳动，使妇女和儿童的身体健康得到保护，而且起了移风易俗的作用。
    中国千百年来不是流传着“女子包做一切家务”的习俗吗？在农村中，妇女得担负做饭、洗衣、砍柴、带孩子、缝补衣鞋、推磨、打猪草、种菜园等等沉重的家务劳动。因此，有些生育过多的妇女，往往累得腰酸背疼，有些人甚至留下了终身的疾病。男人呢？从田里回来后，“油瓶倒了也不扶”，饭来张口，衣来伸手，甚至“洗脚水”也要老婆给打来，这显然是一种很不合理、很不公平的现象。虽然，农村里的家务劳动不可避免地妇女要比男人多负担一些，但是，家庭既然是夫妇双方共同生活的基础，那么和家庭日常生活相连系的一切家务劳动，男女双方都应该负有责任。特别是现在，许多妇女既要参加农业劳动，又要包做一切家务，他们每天的劳动时间，往往长达十二小时甚至十四小时，既损害了妇女健康，也影响了对孩子的教养和保护，这就更加显得不合理了。七塘农业生产合作社改变了这种习俗，表现了他们大胆的革新精神。
    既然是“移风易俗”，就必然会碰到一种习惯势力的阻挠，就会有新旧思想的斗争。现在，有许多地方不就有这样的舆论吗？有的老年人认为这是：“祖祖辈辈传下来的规矩，不能打破”，有的青、壮年认为：男子做家务事是“怕老婆”，“不光荣”。因此，使这些人认识到这种“规矩”是应该和可以打破的，认识到男子分担一些家务劳动是合理的，也是光荣的，就要做一些思想教育工作。七塘农业生产合作社党支部正因为认识了这一点，所以首先在党员中进行了保护妇女和儿童健康的重要性的教育，批判了种种不正确的思想，并且由生产队长苏才松等人向大家介绍了和妻子分担家务劳动的好处。这种既有道理、又有活的事实的教育，才使男社员觉得“言之有理”，一个一个的帮助女社员分担起家务劳动来。
    这种移风易俗的做法，是值得提倡的。
