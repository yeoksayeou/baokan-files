    Pre-Shrinking Fabric Before Garment Production

    Many comrades in our organization have bought uniforms and dresses that shrink significantly after being washed, making them ill-fitting and causing concern. We hope that clothing factories will pre-shrink the fabric before processing and manufacturing garments.

    做衣服先下水后加工
    我们机关很多同志买的制服和连衣裙，下水一洗，就缩了一截，穿起来不合身，让人发愁。希望服装加工厂在做衣服的时候，先把布料下水然后再加工制做。
