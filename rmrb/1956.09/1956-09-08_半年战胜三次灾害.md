    Overcoming Three Disasters in Half a Year
    Lei Yuqing
    In Du'an Yao Autonomous County, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, more than half a year has seen three consecutive wind and flood disasters. Even the eighty-year-olds say, "We have never seen such severe disasters." In the past, such extraordinary disasters would have claimed countless lives. However, this year, people have established advanced cooperatives and conquered natural disasters. The Sanli Township Agricultural Production Cooperative is one of the many cooperatives that have overcome disasters.
    The Sanli Township Agricultural Cooperative in the Bao'an District suffered the most severe disasters. The cooperative planted 2,562 mu of early-maturing and mid-season corn. Because of appropriate close planting, increased fertilization, the corn grew better than in any previous year. However, just as the early-maturing corn was budding and the mid-season corn was flowering, a strong wind with heavy rain struck. Overnight, the well-grown corn was lying in the mud. Simply扶扶the corn up and tamp down the roots was not enough, because it would still fall over with a slight breeze. The Zhou Shangxi production team inserted a bamboo stake under each corn plant and secured it with a rope, which had a good wind-proof effect. But each mu of corn had 3,000 to 3,200 plants, so how many millions of bamboo stakes would be needed for more than 2,500 mu of corn! "Saving the disaster is like fighting a fire." These corn plants had to be扶扶ed up within three or four days, or they would all be lost. Could it be done? The Party branch, cooperative leaders, and production team leaders immediately made arrangements to fight the disaster, assigning strong people and those who knew how to repair bamboo stakes to cut bamboo stakes on nearby mountains, while the rest went to the fields to扶扶the corn. At this time, people no longer cared about work points. Because everyone understood that in the face of such a severe disaster, what good would individual work points be if the cooperative had no harvest! So after one team finished rescuing, they immediately followed the command and went to support the teams that had not finished rescuing, and within just four days they had扶扶ed up all the corn that had been blown down.
    This strong wind also brought floods. However, the drainage ditches that the cooperative built this spring limited the area affected by the flood to about 200 mu. After the disaster, the cooperative immediately mobilized manpower to dig ditches and drain water, quickly rescuing 150 mu. Therefore, the flood did not cause major losses.
    Just five or six days after overcoming the first wind and flood disaster, another disaster struck, this time with rain followed by wind. But because the corn had bamboo stakes to help it, the strong wind could not do anything to it, and the cooperative was able to concentrate its main efforts on digging ditches and draining water, ensuring that the floodwater could not stay in the cornfields. When the early-maturing corn was about to ripen and the mid-season corn was about to grain, the third wind and flood disaster came again, but it was also overcome. So the cooperative members said, "This year we are really fighting for grain with the disaster." The result of the summer harvest was: an average yield of 200 jin per mu, only 80 jin less than the average yield per mu last year. Some cooperative members said, "If it weren't for the advanced cooperative, we wouldn't have harvested anything per mu!" This is absolutely true.
    Although the summer harvest crops were reduced by more than 200,000 jin, it can still be made up for in the autumn. The current second crop of corn can yield at least 200 jin per mu on average, so the total autumn harvest can increase by more than 210,000 jin compared to last year; the cooperative's 1,300 mu of sweet potatoes are growing very well, with an average yield of at least 1,000 jin per mu, which can increase the sweet potato production by 661,000 jin compared to last year; and there are 270 mu of black beans, velvet beans, cassava, sorghum and other miscellaneous grains, which can increase production by at least 7,000 jin. In this way, the second half of the year will be able to increase grain production by more than 382,000 jin (sweet potatoes are calculated at four jin per one jin of grain), which is more than enough to make up for the loss of production in the first half of the year. Last year, this township bought more than 40,000 jin of grain from the state. After calculating this increase in production, the cooperative members said: "We don't need to buy grain from the state anymore." But what if we encounter so many disasters again in the summer? The cooperative members are not relaxing their vigilance on this point. Each team is keeping the bamboo stakes well, and when disaster comes, they will overcome it.
    The cooperative's sideline production is also doing well. The largest item in the farmers' sideline income in this place is making sandpaper. After the transition to the advanced cooperative, collective management has improved technology and increased the quality of sandpaper, resulting in higher selling prices and increased income compared to the past. In the second half of the year, the cooperative can sell at least 50 fat pigs, plus helping the supply and marketing cooperative to carry goods, collect mountain products, burn lime, charcoal, etc., the annual sideline net income can reach more than 12,000 yuan. Two thousand yuan has already been distributed in the first half of the year, and the average household can still receive about 21 yuan in the second half of the year. Seeing these favorable conditions for increased production, the cooperative members are even more enthusiastic about production.
    The Sanli Agricultural Cooperative has made such outstanding achievements in the face of such severe disasters. Who can say that the disaster-stricken cooperatives cannot show their superiority?

    半年战胜三次灾害
    雷玉清
    广西省桂西僮族自治州都安瑶族自治县，半年多以来连续遭受三次风灾和水灾，八十多岁的老人也说：“从来没有见过这样重的灾害。”要是在过去，这样的奇灾不知要吞去多少人的生命。但是，今年人们办起了高级社，就把自然灾害战胜了。三力乡农业生产合作社就是战胜灾害的许多合作社中的一个。
    保安区的三力乡农业社是受灾害最严重的一个社。这个社种有二千五百六十二亩的早熟玉米和中造玉米，因为适当密植，加工加肥，玉米长的比过去哪一年都好。但是，正当早熟玉米刚刚出苞和中造玉米刚刚出花的时候，大风夹着大雨袭来了。一夜之间，长得好好的玉米都倒在烂泥里了。光把玉米扶起来，踏紧根部还不行，因为遇到一阵小风，它们还会倒下去。周尚西生产队在每株玉米根下插上一条竹桩，用绳绑稳，防风效果很好。但是每亩玉米有三千到三千二百株，二千五百多亩玉米该要多少百万条竹桩啊！“救灾如救火”，这些玉米必需在三、四天内扶好，不然就会全部失收。能做到吗？党支部和社的领导干部、生产队长立即作出了向灾害作斗争的部署，每队分派力气大的和会修竹桩的人到附近山上砍竹桩，其余的人都到地里扶玉米。这时人们不计较什么工分了。因为谁都明白，在这样严重的灾害前面，要是社里没有收，个人得工分有什么用！所以这一队抢救完了，马上就听从指挥，去支援没有抢救完的队，仅仅四天内就把吹倒的玉米扶好了。
    这次大风还带来了水灾。但是，今春社里修了排洪沟，使遭受水灾的范围被限制到二百亩左右，遭灾后，合作社马上调动人力在那里开沟排水，很快就抢救了一百五十亩，因此，水灾并没有造成大的损失。
    战胜了第一次的风灾和水灾，只隔了五、六天，灾害又袭来了，这次是先雨后风。但是因为玉米有了竹桩做帮手，大风奈何它不得，合作社得以集中主要力量开沟排水，赶得洪水在玉米地里也不能停留。到早熟玉米快要成熟、中造玉米快要结粒的时候，第三次大风灾和洪水又来了，但也同样被战胜了。所以社员们说：“今年真是和灾害争粮。”夏收的结果是：平均每亩收获量二百斤。比去年平均每亩产量只减少八十斤。有的社员说：“要不是高级社，一亩也不得收啊！”这是千真万确的话。
    虽然夏收作物减产二十多万斤，但是，到秋季还是可以弥补的。现在种的二造玉米，平均每亩起码可收二百斤，到秋共可以比去年增产二十一万多斤；社里的一千三百多亩甘薯长得很好，平均每亩至少能收一千斤，这又可以比去年增产甘薯六十六万一千斤；还有二百七十亩的黑豆、猫豆、木薯、高粱等杂粮，至少可以增产七千斤。这样，下半年将能增产三十八万二千多斤粮食（甘薯按四斤折一斤粮食计算），弥补上半年的减产损失还有余。去年这个乡向国家买了四万多斤粮食，算了这个增产账以后，社员说：我们不用向国家买粮了。但是，要是再遇到夏季那么多的灾害怎么办呢？对于这点，现在社员们并没有放松警惕，每个队都把竹桩保管得好好的，灾害来，就战胜它。
    这个合作社的副业生产也搞得不坏。这个地方农民副业收入中最大的一项是造沙纸。转高级社后，由于集体经营改进了技术，提高了沙纸质量，卖价高，收入将比过去增加。下半年社里至少可卖出五十口肥猪，加上帮供销社挑运货物、采集山货、烧石灰、木炭等等，全年副业纯收入可达到一万二千多元。上半年已经分了二千元，下半年平均每户还可分到二十一元左右。社员们看到这些增产的有利条件，生产积极性更高了。
    三力农业社在这么严重的灾害下面还做出了这等出色的成绩，谁能说受灾的合作社不能显示出优越性？
