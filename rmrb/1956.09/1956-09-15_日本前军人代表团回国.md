Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 14th. The Japanese ex-servicemen delegation of fifteen members, after a month-long visit to major cities including Beijing, Chongqing, Shenyang, Changchun, Nanjing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou, left Guangzhou yesterday via Hong Kong to return home.

On the 12th, Li Dachao, vice chairman of the Guangzhou Red Cross Society, handed over the ashes of ten Japanese war criminals who died of illness or were executed during the Kuomintang rule from 1946 to 1948 to the delegation to take back to Japan. At the ceremony for receiving the ashes, Saburo Endo, former Lieutenant General of the Japanese Army, said that before leaving Japan to come to China, members of the Japanese war criminals' bereaved families organization requested them to bring back the ashes of the deceased. We conveyed this request to Marshal Chen Yi in Beijing, and soon we received their remains. This is a manifestation of the Chinese people's friendship towards the Japanese people, and I believe that the bereaved families of the war criminals will deeply thank you. The warm hospitality of the Chinese people towards us is unforgettable.
