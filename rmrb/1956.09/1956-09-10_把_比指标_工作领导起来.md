    Lead the Work of "Comparing Indicators"

    Since the new upsurge in industrial production, many factories have been striving to learn from advanced factories across the country, sending representatives to other places to collect advanced indicators and learn advanced experiences, which has achieved remarkable results. For example, in March of this year, the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory sent people to farm implement factories in Hunan Province and Kaifeng City to learn advanced experiences and collect sixteen advanced production indicators related to the manufacture of double-wheel double-furrow plows. After the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory announced these indicators internally, the workers actively learned from advanced experiences, and in just over a month, ten indicators caught up with or even surpassed those of brother factories. This example shows that the method of comparing indicators plays a promoting role in popularizing advanced experiences and improving the production technology level of enterprises.

    However, the current work of collecting advanced indicators is still in a spontaneous state and lacks specific organization and leadership. Taking the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory as an example, if you ask them: Which brother factories have more advanced production indicators than you in recent months? They cannot answer, because they have not sent anyone out to contact them recently and do not understand the situation. In fact, both farm implement factories and machine factories have higher-level administrative organs and trade union organizations that directly lead them. These leading departments have a grasp of the situation of various factories across the country. If they can regularly compile and print various advanced production indicators of various factories in various places into materials and send them to various factories and enterprises, or organize regular exchange of information and intelligence between factories in a guided manner, wouldn't it be possible to timely understand the situation, exchange experiences, and reduce the waste of manpower and material resources caused by each factory running around independently?

### 把“比指标”工作领导起来

    把“比指标”工作领导起来
    自从工业生产的新高涨到来以后，很多工厂都争取向全国的先进工厂看齐，纷纷派代表到外地收集先进指标和学习先进经验，收到了显著的效果。例如北京农业机械厂今年3月份曾经派人到湖南省和开封市等地的农具厂去学习先进经验，收集了有关制造双轮双铧犁的十六项先进生产指标。北京农业机械厂将这些指标在厂内公布后，工人积极学习先进经验，在一个多月的时间里，就有十项指标赶上甚至超过了兄弟厂。这个例子说明，比指标的方法，对推广先进经验和提高企业的生产技术水平是起着促进作用的。
    可是，目前收集先进指标的工作还处于自发状态，缺乏具体组织和领导。拿北京农业机械厂来说，如果你要问他们：最近几个月来，又有哪些兄弟厂的生产指标比你们先进了？他们就回答不出来，因为他们最近没有再派人出去联系，对情况就不了解了。其实，农具厂也好，机器厂也好，都有直接领导他们的上级行政机关和工会组织。这些领导部门掌握着全国各地各厂的情况，如果他们能经常把各地各厂的各种先进生产指标编印成资料，发到各工厂企业里去，或者是有领导地组织各工厂之间定期交换资料，互通情报，这样，不是既可以及时了解情况，交流经验，又可以减少各工厂独自奔跑所造成的人力、物力上的浪费吗？　尚元
