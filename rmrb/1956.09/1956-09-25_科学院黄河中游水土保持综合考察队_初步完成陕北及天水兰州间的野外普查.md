    Academy of Sciences' Comprehensive Expedition Team for Soil and Water Conservation in the Middle Reaches of the Yellow River
    Initially Completes Field Survey in Northern Shaanxi and Between Tianshui and Lanzhou

    This newspaper reports that the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Comprehensive Expedition Team for Soil and Water Conservation in the Middle Reaches of the Yellow River has preliminarily completed a field survey of 80,000 square kilometers in areas including northern Shaanxi and between Tianshui and Lanzhou, as well as the comprehensive planning of four key areas. Currently, they are actively engaged in the key planning of the last small area. A large number of specimens collected in the field have been sent to relevant laboratories for classification and research. All fieldwork is expected to be completed by the end of September, and the indoor summary will begin in early October, striving to complete the summary by the end of October.

    This comprehensive expedition team for soil and water conservation consists of more than 200 scientific workers and staff from the Institute of Geology, Institute of Soil Science, Institute of Geography, Institute of Botany, Institute of Economics, Institute of Agricultural Biology, Institute of Geophysics, and related departments of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. In 1955, they completed the survey and key planning work in an area of more than 20,000 square kilometers with severe soil erosion in western Shanxi. From late April to early May this year, they were divided into two teams with more than twenty specialized groups, led and guided by experts in various disciplines and more than twenty senior scientific workers, and transferred to severely eroded areas such as northern Shaanxi and between Tianshui and Lanzhou to conduct surveys and key planning work.

    The area surveyed this time includes approximately 80,000 square kilometers of surveys in the Wuding River basin of northern Shaanxi and the area between Baiyu Mountain and Zhongwei, and the area between Tianshui and Lanzhou. It also includes detailed surveys in Suide, Mizhi, Yulin, the middle and upper reaches of the Dali River in northern Shaanxi, and Longxi, Xiji, Bai'ankou, Longde, Gan Yanchi, Tianshui, Ma'anshan, Xinglong Mountain, and Qin'an in Gansu. Furthermore, it involves comprehensive planning of five key areas: Qingyun Mountain and Zhangjiapan in northern Shaanxi, Shaochagou near Huining in Gansu, Anjiagou in the western suburbs of Dingxi, and Xiaojingou in the western suburbs of Lanzhou. The area is complex and the task is extremely arduous.

    The research projects of this expedition include comprehensive scientific research in geology (Quaternary geology and neo-tectonic movement), geography (geomorphology and economic geography), soil science (soil geography and soil erosion), botany (classification and ecology), economics, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, hydrology and meteorology, field engineering, water conservancy measures, and summary of mass soil and water conservation experiences. The above work, through surveys, detailed investigations, key planning, experimental research and analysis in the field and indoors, and key research on various special topics, aims to clarify the interrelationship between various natural laws and the laws of social and economic development and soil erosion in the area, and provide scientific basis for comprehensive soil and water conservation land rational utilization planning and design.

    科学院黄河中游水土保持综合考察队
    初步完成陕北及天水兰州间的野外普查
    本报讯　中国科学院黄河中游水土保持综合考察队初步完成陕北及天水、兰州间等地区八万平方公里的野外普查和四个重点区的全面规划工作。目前正在积极进行最后一个小区的重点规划，野外采集的大批标本已分别送到各有关实验室进行分类研究，全部野外工作预计9月下旬结束，10月初转入室内总结，并争取在10月底总结完毕。
    这个水土保持综合考察队是由中国科学院地质、土壤、地理、植物、经济、农业生物、地球物理等研究所及有关部门的二百多名科学工作者和工作人员组成的。1955年他们曾在山西西部两万余平方公里水土流失严重地区完成了普查和重点规划工作。在今年4月底5月初，他们又分为两队二十几个专业组，在各科专家和二十几名高级科学工作者的率领、指导下，转入陕北及天水、兰州间等水土流失严重地区进行普查和重点规划工作。
    这次考察的区域：包括陕北无定河流域及白于山至中卫间地区，天水至兰州间等地区约八万平方公里的普查，和陕北绥德、米脂、榆林、大理河中上游及甘肃的陇西、西吉、白庵口、隆德、甘盐池、天水、马鞍山、兴隆山、秦安等地区的详查；以及陕北青云山、张家畔、甘肃会宁附近梢岔沟、定西北郊安家沟、兰州西郊小金沟等五个重点区的全面规划，地区复杂，任务极为艰巨。
    这次考察研究的项目，包括地质（第四组地质和新构造运动）、地理（地貌和经济地理）、土壤（土壤地理及土壤侵蚀）、植物（分类和生态）、经济、农业、林业、畜牧、水文气象、田间工程、水利措施及群众水土保持经验总结等各方面的综合科学研究等。以上工作通过普查、详查、重点规划、野外室内的试验研究分析及各项专题的重点研究，以阐明该区内各种自然规律和社会经济发展的规律与水土流失的相互关系，为全面开展水土保持土地合理利用规划设计提供科学根据。　　　（张国维）
