Comrade Lin Feng, Director of the Second Office of the State Council, Speaks:

I completely agree with the reports made by Comrades Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, and Deng Xiaoping on behalf of the Central Committee.

In their reports, Comrades Liu Shaoqi and Zhou Enlai provided a basic summary of the cultural, educational, scientific, and health work of the past few years and clearly pointed out the future direction and tasks. All comrades in cultural and educational work should work hard to realize the arduous tasks of cultural construction based on these instructions.

Now I would like to talk about the issue of cultivating construction talents in our country.

The basic completion of the socialist transformation and the further liberation of productive forces will enable us to concentrate our efforts on promoting the country's socialist industrialization and the technological transformation of the national economy. One of the main difficulties we are currently facing in our development is technological backwardness and a lack of technical cadres. Our country needs a large number of specialized talents who can master modern and complex science and technology. Therefore, cultivating more and better construction talents for the country, especially scientific and technological talents, is an extremely important task that our Party and the country, especially the cultural and educational departments, shoulder in realizing our country's socialist construction.

A Large Number of Construction Talents Were Cultivated, But There Was Also a Tendency to Neglect Quality

In recent years, thanks to the attention and correct leadership of the Party and the government, the joint efforts of educational departments, professional departments, and various schools, the work of cultivating cadres has made great achievements. From liberation to this year, the number of graduates from universities in our country has reached more than 300,000, which is 43 percent more than the total number of university graduates in the 54 years before liberation. A large number of young cadres are working vigorously in various construction departments of the country. There is no doubt that this is a significant contribution to our country's socialist construction. However, from the perspective of the requirements of national construction, the talents cultivated by universities at present are insufficient in quantity, especially in quality, and are far from meeting the needs.

At present, we not only need a large number of technical cadres, but also cadres of considerable quality. Given our current capacity to cultivate cadres, it is difficult to achieve this, and there is a contradiction between quantity and quality. In order to meet the requirements of national construction, higher education must strive to implement the policy of giving equal importance to quantity and quality in the future. Emphasizing quantity without paying attention to quality, or only paying attention to quality without considering quantity, will not meet the needs of national construction and will be one-sided. We must strive to develop the number of students as much as possible while ensuring a certain level of quality. In recent years, the main deviation in the development of higher education has been the excessive emphasis on quantity and insufficient attention to quality. Various departments that use personnel see that their tasks are large and that there is a shortage of cadres, and they naturally ask the educational departments to cultivate more cadres for them. The educational departments, in view of their responsibilities, are willing to do their best to meet the needs of the departments that use personnel, which is also appropriate. However, the problem is that the various types of construction talents that the country needs us to cultivate must possess a certain quality, that is, they must meet certain specifications in order to play their due role in their jobs. If the quality of university graduates is too low and does not meet the specifications required by the state, it will delay work, cause waste, and fail to solve key technical problems, which is detrimental to the country's construction. This shortcoming was not so obvious during the period of economic recovery, but as economic construction progresses further and the requirements for technology become higher and higher, it will be sharply exposed. We must have sufficient understanding of this point and resolutely overcome the tendency to emphasize quantity and neglect quality.

Formulating Plans Requires Investigation and Research, and Cannot Be Based Solely on Subjective Wishes

In order to make the work of cultivating cadres more planned and to solve the problem of quantity and quality more correctly, we should conduct a comprehensive plan for the work of cultivating cadres based on "grasping the key points and taking care of the others," based on needs and possibilities, and based on current needs and long-term plans. This plan should pay attention to both the development of quantity and the guarantee of quality, and should be both active and reliable. We must correctly handle the supply and demand relationship between various categories and specialties, and we must try to basically align the "calibers." Therefore, when formulating plans, we must conduct in-depth and systematic investigation and research, and oppose the subjective work style of being ignorant and acting solely based on subjective wishes.

Use Various Educational Forces and Teaching Methods to Cultivate Construction Talents

In order to meet the large needs of various construction departments for cadres, the education department should try to give full play to its potential, strive to create conditions, and at the same time, fully utilize various educational forces and various teaching methods to cultivate cadres. Experience has proved that the road to cultivate cadres is very broad, and the methods can be diverse. Regular universities and secondary vocational schools are certainly the main places for cultivating cadres, and factories, mines, and government agencies are also important places for cultivating cadres. They can use spare time, adopt flexible methods based on the principle of voluntariness, and use forms such as night schools, correspondence schools, training classes, and study groups to absorb cadres, technicians, and skilled workers in batches and in stages. This kind of on-site part-time education is more convenient for teaching excellent workers and veteran cadres, and the content of teaching is easier to integrate with practice, so it is a very effective way of learning. At present, many of our party work cadres, military cadres, and government mass organization cadres have been trained and cultivated in actual struggle. In the future, a large number of cadres in the construction industry will also be trained in actual work. We should cultivate them. In the past, we did not pay enough attention to this work, and we should strengthen it in the future. In order to strengthen part-time education, the urgent problems to be solved at present are that industrial departments should, in conjunction with relevant parties, ensure that employees have appropriate study time, and the education department should help solve the difficulty of lacking teachers. The requirements for learning should not be too high or too urgent, and the learning time should not be too tight or too long, so as not to hinder production and the health of employees. In addition, more attention must be paid to secondary vocational education. We must overcome the idea of ​​underestimating secondary technical schools and earnestly strengthen the leadership of secondary technical schools.

Vigorously Improve the Teaching Quality of Schools

In order to cultivate qualified construction talents, we must vigorously improve the teaching quality of schools. This is the central issue of the current work of universities. In recent years, universities across the country have carried out reforms in the school system, curriculum, ideological transformation of teachers, and adjustment of departments, based on the party and the state's education policy, and have made a series of reforms in teaching according to the needs of national construction and learning from the experience of the Soviet Union, establishing a new set of teaching system. In this way, our goal of cultivating cadres has become clearer, planning has been strengthened, and in particular, the leading position of Marxism-Leninism in higher education has been established, and the quality of teaching has been improved. Now, in most universities, this teaching reform work has basically come to an end. The future task is mainly to improve the teaching content, improve ideological work, and improve teaching methods, so as to continuously improve the quality of teaching. The central issue here is how to make higher education work more in line with China's actual situation and more suitable for the needs of China's socialist construction. In order to achieve this goal, we must seriously check the teaching content, system, methods, etc., summarize the experience of higher education work in recent years, carry forward achievements, overcome shortcomings, and correct mistakes. We must carry out this work actively and meticulously, and must not be satisfied with existing achievements or act rashly.

Continue to Learn from Soviet Experience and Critically Accept the Cultural Heritage of the Motherland

The remarkable achievements made in the reform and development of higher education in our country are inseparable from learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. In the future, we should continue to diligently learn from the experience of the Soviet Union, learn from the experience of other people's democratic countries, and also absorb things that are useful to us from capitalist countries. We must learn all the good things from foreign countries. However, learning from foreign experience must be combined with China's actual situation. It is wrong to refuse to learn from foreign experience or to adopt a dogmatic attitude of mechanically copying.

We must also critically accept the cultural heritage of the motherland as an important content of education. This is especially important in history, philosophy, literature, art, medicine, agronomy, and other aspects. For the rich cultural heritage of the motherland, we must use modern scientific knowledge and methods to carefully sort out and study them so that they can directly and indirectly serve our country's current socialist construction. It is wrong to take a dismissive or even completely negate attitude towards the national cultural heritage. This nihilistic attitude toward the nation is the main deviation in dealing with the issue of national cultural heritage today. Of course, it is also wrong to accept the national heritage indiscriminately.

Correctly Implement the Education Policy of All-Round Development

Improving teaching quality must correctly implement the education policy of all-round development. The cadres that the state requires universities to cultivate should be high-level construction talents who have a certain foundation of Marxist-Leninist knowledge, master modern science and technology, are healthy, and wholeheartedly serve socialism. In recent years, universities across the country have basically implemented this policy and have made achievements. But we still have shortcomings in this regard. Some comrades misunderstood "all-round development" as "average development," mechanically demanding that students' grades in all subjects be equally good, overemphasizing collective activities, ignoring the development of students' personalities, and using a model to shape cadres, which are all wrong. True collectivism must be combined with the development of personality. Without the high degree of consciousness, initiative, creativity, and full play of the unique talents of each member of society, collectivism has no foundation. At present, the study and extracurricular activities of university students are generally too burdensome, and the arrangements for students' lives are too rigid and too tight, which is detrimental to the cultivation of students' independent thinking and independent working ability and their health. At present, the enthusiasm of our students for learning is generally very high, which is worth encouraging. While correcting the excessive burden on students, we must also prevent the possible phenomenon of freedom and relaxation, and slackness in learning. Students must be educated that they can only cultivate themselves into builders of socialism who master modern scientific and technological knowledge through their own hard work.

Improving Teaching Quality Must Start from the Existing Foundation of Each School and Cannot Be Forced to Be Uniform

Improving teaching quality must start from the existing foundation of each school, be realistic, and be gradually realized. It cannot be forced to be uniform, nor can it be required to be too urgent. The foundations of each school are unbalanced, and at the same time, the state's requirements for the quality of cadres are also different. Therefore, the state can and must plan to select a group of schools with a better foundation, allocate them as key points, and require them to train higher-quality engineering and technical personnel, scientific research personnel, and teachers, and at the same time, create experience and compile some teaching materials for other universities to refer to and apply, helping and driving the improvement of other universities across the country. The state should require these key schools to approach or catch up with the international advanced level in teaching quality and the development of some scientific departments within a certain period of time. In leadership, it is inappropriate to disregard the differences in existing foundations and conditions and force all schools to be uniform in terms of school system and teaching plans, or to allocate teachers, equipment, etc. in an egalitarian manner. Of course, general schools should also be comprehensively and appropriately taken care of so that all schools can gradually improve on the existing foundation. It is in line with objective reality and is beneficial to the development of higher education and the construction of the entire country to make different demands on schools with different conditions.

Strengthen Scientific Research and Implement the Policy of "Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom, a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend"

In order to solve some scientific and technological problems for the country and to improve the level of teaching, universities must strengthen scientific research work in a planned way in accordance with the country's scientific development plan. In carrying out scientific research work and teaching work in universities, it is necessary to implement the policy of "Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom, a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" and encourage independent thinking and free discussion in academic matters. Teachers should teach the correct theories and knowledge that have been proven by practice according to the teaching syllabus in teaching, and they should also be allowed to introduce various different theories and express their own opinions. Each school must make overall arrangements for teaching work and scientific research work according to its own conditions. Only focusing on teaching and not paying attention to scientific research cannot improve the quality of teaching; one-sidedly emphasizing scientific research and relaxing teaching work cannot fulfill the main responsibilities of teachers. Universities must closely contact, divide labor, and cooperate with the Academy of Sciences and scientific research institutions of relevant departments in carrying out scientific research work.

Effectively Solve the Problem of Teachers in Universities

Effectively and efficiently solving the problem of teachers in universities is the key to improving higher education work at present.

On the one hand, universities should better implement the Party's policy of uniting, educating, and transforming intellectuals, give full play to the enthusiasm of teachers, and give full play to their talents. Party member cadres and Party member teacher in universities should pay special attention to overcoming and preventing sectarian tendencies, should often listen to the opinions of non-Party intellectuals, humbly learn from them, respect their powers, and at the same time, earnestly and effectively help them progress politically. We must further strengthen the unity of new and old teachers. In recent years, the relationship between new and old teachers in schools has generally improved, but in some schools there is still a lack of unity. New and old teachers should respect each other and cooperate closely. Young teachers must humbly learn from old teachers to improve their level; old teachers should also take the cultivation of younger generations as their glorious responsibility.

On the other hand, we must actively supplement the reserve force of teachers. At present, the shortage of teachers in universities is very prominent. Taking higher industrial schools as an example, the number of students enrolled this year increased by 73% compared with last year, while the number of teachers only increased by 33%; at the same time, 68% of the existing teachers are teaching assistants who graduated from school not long ago or graduated early. The burden on teachers is too heavy, which can be imagined. Therefore, it is very necessary to suggest that various business departments, for the long-term plan of cultivating cadres, should endure the pain for a while in the next few years and appropriately reduce the number of graduates they want, leaving a necessary number of teaching assistants and graduate students for schools as a reserve force of teachers. Otherwise, the development of universities and the improvement of teaching quality will be very difficult in the future.

In order to strengthen the training of senior scientific and technological talents and teachers, attention must be paid to the work of sending students to study abroad. In the future, those who are sent to the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries to study abroad should implement the policy of sending more graduate students and fewer senior high school graduates. Excellent graduates, excellent teachers, and scientific research personnel from universities should be selected to study disciplines that our country now lacks or are very weak, and not to study ordinary knowledge that can also be learned in China. It is also necessary to plan to expand the number of students sent to capitalist countries and strive to bring back students who are now in capitalist countries to serve the motherland.

In order to ensure that universities and secondary vocational schools have sufficient and good sources of students, we must pay more attention to developing and running junior high schools and senior high schools well, and strive to gradually reach a ratio of 1:1.5 to 1:2 between the number of university students and the number of senior high school graduates in the next few years; at the same time, we must strive to improve the quality of secondary education.

In order to complete the task of cultivating cadres, we must continue to gradually and realistically improve the material conditions such as the housing and teaching equipment of universities.

Correctly Implement Dual Leadership and Give Play to the Enthusiasm of Various Departments and Localities

In order to strengthen the leadership of universities, the enthusiasm of various departments and localities should be further brought into play, and dual leadership should be correctly implemented. The Ministry of Higher Education mainly directly leads comprehensive universities and various multi-disciplinary colleges related to several departments. Other schools should be gradually handed over to the management of various business departments or localities, and they should be primarily responsible for them. The Ministry of Higher Education focuses on the leadership of policies and teaching, organizes the exchange of experience, and provides necessary teaching materials. In order to give play to the initiative and creativity of schools, to reduce the administrative affairs of the higher-level leading organs, and to strengthen the leadership of important work, the current situation of managing too much and restricting too rigidly in all aspects of the work of universities should be changed, and the authority of universities to handle problems should be appropriately expanded. The Ministry of Higher Education should strengthen inspection, go deep into the lower levels, and strive to overcome the subjective and idealistic style of work. All comrades engaged in education work must respond to the call of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, study science assiduously, delve into their professions, and strive to become experts in their fields as quickly as possible, so as to more effectively complete the task of cultivating cadres.

Actively Carry out Party Building Work Among Intellectuals and Pay Attention to Giving Play to the Role of Democratic Parties

According to the instructions of the Party Central Committee, Party building work should be actively carried out among intellectuals, and people who meet the conditions should be admitted to the Party. This is also an important measure to strengthen the Party's leadership over the work of cultivating cadres. In this work, we must continue to overcome the closed-doorism tendencies of some comrades, and at the same time, prevent the one-sided task view of lowering standards and pursuing quantity. In universities, attention should be paid to giving play to the role of the democratic parties, earnestly implementing the policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision," and cooperating closely with them to do all kinds of work well.

Finally, doing a good job in cultivating talents for the country's construction and strengthening the Party's leadership in this regard is of decisive significance. We must run a university as well as we run a large factory. We know that cultural construction must be based on the development of economic construction and must be closely coordinated with economic construction, but the work of cultivating cadres and scientific research must be made to take a step earlier, in order to provide more effective service to economic construction.

专栏：

    关于我们国家培养建设人材的问题
    国务院第二办公室主任　林枫同志的发言
    我完全同意刘少奇同志、周恩来同志和邓小平同志代表中央委员会所作的报告。
    刘少奇同志和周恩来同志在他们的报告中对于几年来的文化、教育、科学、保健工作作了基本的总结，明确指出了今后的方针和任务。全体文教工作同志应该根据这些指示，为实现文化建设的艰巨任务而努力。
    现在我想讲一讲我们国家的培养建设人材问题。
    社会主义改造的基本完成和生产力的进一步解放，将使我们能够集中全力来推进国家的社会主义工业化和国民经济的技术改造。目前我们在发展中的主要困难之一，就是技术落后和技术干部的缺乏。我们的国家需要有大量的能够掌握现代复杂的科学技术的专门人材。因此，又多又好地为国家培养各项建设人材，特别是科学技术人材，这是我们的党和国家特别是文教部门在实现我国社会主义建设中所担负的一项极其重要的任务。
    培养了大批建设人材也曾发生过忽视质量偏向
    几年来，由于党和政府的重视和正确领导，教育部门、业务部门和各学校的共同努力，培养干部的工作已经有了很大的成绩。从解放到今年，我国高等学校的毕业生已达三十万余人，这比解放以前五十四年间的高等学校毕业生总数还多百分之四十三。大批青年干部正在国家的各个建设部门朝气蓬勃地工作着，没有疑问，这对我国的社会主义建设是一个不小的贡献。但是，从国家建设的要求来看，当前高等学校所培养出来的人材，在数量上，特别在质量上，还十分不够，还远远赶不上需要。
    现在，我们不但需要大量的技术干部，而且需要有相当质量的干部，以现在我们培养干部的力量来讲，要作到这点是存在着困难的，在数量和质量之间的问题上是有矛盾的。为要适应国家建设的要求，今后高等教育必须尽量执行数量和质量兼顾的方针。偏重数量而不注意质量，或者只注意质量而不照顾数量，都将不能适应国家建设的需要，都有片面性。要求在保证一定质量的条件下，尽可能地发展学生的数量。几年来在高等教育的发展问题上的主要偏向是过分强调了数量，对质量注意不够。各个用人部门看到自己的任务大，干部缺，要求教育部门为他们多培养些干部，这是很自然的。教育部门鉴于自己的责任，愿意尽力满足用人部门的需要，这也是应该的。但是，问题在于国家需要我们培养的各类建设人材必须具备一定的质量，即必须合乎一定的规格，才能在工作岗位上发挥应有的作用。如果高等学校的毕业生质量过低，不合乎国家所需要的规格，就会耽误工作，造成浪费，不能解决技术上的关键问题，这对于国家的建设是不利的。这种缺点在经济恢复时期还不那么明显，当经济建设越往前发展，对技术的要求越来越高的时候，便会尖锐地暴露出来。我们对于这一点必须有足够的认识，坚决克服强调数量忽视质量的偏向。
    制定规划要作调查研究不能单凭主观愿望办事
      为使培养干部的工作作得更有计划，并且能够比较正确地解决数量和质量的问题，我们应该根据“掌握重点，照顾其它”，根据需要和可能，根据目前需要和长远打算，对培养干部工作进行全面规划。这种规划要既注意数量的发展，又注意质量的保证，既要积极，又要可靠。必须正确地处理各个门类、各项专业的供求关系，要设法做到基本上对准“口径”。为此，在制定规划的时候，就必须作深入的系统的调查研究，反对心中无数，单凭主观愿望办事的主观主义作风。
    运用各种教育力量和教学方式来培养建设人材
    为适应各建设部门对干部的大量需要，教育部门应当设法充分发挥潜力，努力创造条件，同时还应当充分运用各种教育力量和各种教学方式来培养干部。经验证明，培养干部的道路很宽广，方式可以多种多样。正规的高等学校和中等专业学校固然是培养干部的主要场所，而厂矿、机关也是培养干部的重要场所，它们可以利用业余时间，根据自愿的原则，采取灵活的办法，用夜校、函授学校、训练班、学习小组等形式，分批分期地吸收干部、技术人员和熟练工人学习。这种在现场举办的业余教育，更便于对优秀工人和老干部进行教学，教学的内容更容易结合实际，因此是一种很有效的学习方式。现在我们党的工作干部、军队干部和政府群众团体的干部，很多都是在实际斗争中锻炼和培植出来的，建设事业中的干部将来也会有大批是从实际工作中锻炼出来的，我们应该对他们加以培植，过年我们对这项工作注意不够，今后应该加强。为加强业余教育，当前迫切需要解决的问题是，产业部门应该会同有关方面保证职工有适当的学习时间，教育部门应该帮助解决教师缺乏的困难。对学习的要求不要太高太急，学习时间不要太紧太长，以免妨害生产和职工的健康。此外，对中等专业教育，必须给以更多的注意。要克服轻视中等技术学校的思想，切实加强对中等技术学校的领导。
    大力提高学校的教学质量
    为要培养合格的建设人材，就必须大力提高学校的教学质量。这是当前高等学校工作的中心问题。几年来全国高等学校根据了党和国家的教育方针，进行了学制改革、课程改革、教师的思想改造和院系调整，并且根据国家建设的需要和学习苏联的经验，在教学方面作了一系列的改革，建立起一套新的教学制度。这样，就使我们培养干部的目标更加明确了，计划性加强了，特别是确立了马克思列宁主义思想在高等教育中的领导地位，教学质量有所提高。现在在多数高等学校，这种教学改革工作已经基本上告一段落，今后的任务主要是改进教学内容，提高思想工作，改进教学方法，以继续不断地提高教学质量。这里的中心问题就是怎样使高等教育工作更加切合我国的实际，更加适合我国社会主义建设的需要。为了达到这个目的，必须认真地从教学内容、制度、方法等方面切实进行检查，总结几年来高等教育工作的经验，发扬成绩，克服缺点，改正错误。我们必须积极地细致地进行这一工作，不可满足于已有的成就或草率从事。
    继续学习苏联经验批判地接受祖国文化遗产
    我国高等教育的改革和发展所以取得显著的成绩，是与学习了苏联的先进经验分不开的。今后我们还应该继续勤勤恳恳地学习苏联的经验，同时学习其他人民民主国家的经验，也要吸取资本主义国家的对我们有用的东西。一切外国的好东西，我们都要学。但是，学习外国经验必须结合中国的实际，拒绝学习外国的经验，或者采取教条主义的机械搬用的态度都是错误的。
    我们还必须批判地接受祖国文化遗产，作为教育的重要内容。这在历史、哲学、文学、艺术、医药、农艺等方面尤其重要。对于祖国丰富的文化遗产，我们必须利用现代科学的知识和方法，认真地加以整理和研究，使它们能为我国当前的社会主义建设直接和间接地服务。对民族文化遗产采取轻视甚至一概抹煞的态度是错误的。这种民族虚无主义的态度是今天在对待民族文化遗产问题上的主要偏向。当然，对民族遗产不加选择地全盘接受也是不对的。
    正确地贯彻执行全面发展的教育方针
    提高教学质量必须正确地贯彻全面发展的教育方针。国家要求高等学校培养的干部，应该是具有一定的马克思列宁主义的基础知识，掌握现代科学技术，身体健康，全心全意为社会主义服务的高级建设人材。几年来全国高等学校基本上执行了这一方针，作出了成绩。但是我们在这方面还有缺点。有些同志把“全面发展”误解为“平均发展”，机械地要求学生各科成绩要一样好，过分地强调集体活动，忽视了学生个性的发展，用一个模型来塑造干部都是不对的。真正的集体主义，必须和个性的发展相结合，没有各个社会成员的高度的自觉、主动性、创造性及其独特才能的充分发挥，集体主义便没有基础。现在高等学校学生的学习和课外活动负担一般过重，对学生的生活安排得过死过紧，这样对学生的独立思考和独立工作能力的培养和他们的健康是不利的。现在我们学生的学习的积极性普遍很高，这是值得鼓励的。在纠正学生负担过重的时候，也要防止可能发生的自由散漫、学习松劲的现象。要教育学生必须通过自己的勤劳学习，才能把自己培养成为掌握现代科学技术知识的社会主义的建设者。
    提高教学质量必须从各个学校的现有基础出发，不能强求一律
    提高教学质量必须从各个学校现有的基础出发，实事求是地和逐步地实现，不能强求一律，也不能要求过急。各个学校的基础是不平衡的，同时国家建设对干部质量的要求也是不一样的，因此，国家可以而且必须有计划地选择一批基础较好的学校，作重点的配备，要求它们培养出质量较高的工程技术人员、科学研究人员和师资，同时创造经验，编订一部分教材，供其他高等学校参考应用，帮助和带动全国其他高等学校的提高。国家应该要求这些重点学校在一定的时期内在教学质量上，在若干科学部门的发展上，接近或者赶上国际先进水平。在领导上，如果不顾现有基础和条件的不同，在学制和教学计划方面强求各校一律，或者平均主义地配备师资、设备等都是不妥当的。当然，对一般学校也应当全面地适当地加以照顾，这样才能使所有的学校都能从现有基础上逐步地提高。我们对于不同条件的学校，提出不同的要求，是合乎客观实际的，对高等教育的发展和整个国家的建设都是有利的。
    加强科学研究工作，贯彻“百家争鸣”方针
    为了为国家解决一部分科学技术问题，为了提高教学水平，高等学校必须依照国家的科学发展规划，有计划地加强科学研究工作，在高等学校里开展科学研究工作和进行教学工作，都必须贯彻“百家争鸣”的方针，鼓励学术上的独立思考和自由讨论。教师在教学上应该根据教学大纲讲授已经被实践证明了的正确的学说和知识，也应该允许他们介绍各种不同的学说，发表他们自己的见解。各个学校必须根据自己的条件，对教学工作和科学研究工作作通盘的安排。只管教学，不注意科学研究就不能提高教学的质量；片面强调科学研究，放松教学工作，便不能尽到教师的主要职责。高等学校在开展科学研究工作中必须和科学院和有关部门的科学研究机关密切联系，分工合作。
    切实解决高等学校的师资问题
    切实有效地解决高等学校的师资问题，是当前改进和提高高等教育工作的关键。
    一方面，高等学校要更好地贯彻党的团结、教育和改造知识分子的政策，高度发挥教师的积极性，充分发挥他们的才能。高等学校中的党员干部和党员团员教师应该特别注意克服和防止宗派主义的倾向，要经常倾听党外知识分子的意见，虚心向他们学习，尊重他们的职权，同时在政治上认真和有效地帮助他们进步。我们要进一步加强新老教师的团结。近年来，学校中新老教师的关系一般有了改进，但是在一部分学校里还有不够团结的现象。新老教师应该互相尊重，密切合作。年轻教师必须虚心向老教师学习，以提高自己的水平；老教师也应该以培养后进作为自己的光荣责任。
    另一方面，必须积极地补充师资的后备力量。目前高等学校师资紧张的情况是很突出的。以高等工业学校为例，今年招生数比去年增长百分之七十三，而师资则只增长了百分之三十三；同时现有教师中有百分之六十八是从学校毕业不久或者提前毕业的助教。教师负担过重，可以想见。因此，建议各个业务部门为培养干部的长远打算，在今后几年内，要忍痛一时，适当地少要些毕业生，为学校留下必要数量的助教和研究生，作为师资的后备力量，是很必要的。否则今后高等学校的发展和教学质量的提高都有很大的困难。
    为要加强培养高级科学技术人材和师资，必须注意派遣留学生的工作。今后派到苏联和人民民主国家去留学的，应该贯彻多派研究生少派高级中学毕业生的方针。应该选派高等学校的优秀的毕业生、优秀教师和科学研究人员，去学习我国现在还缺少的或者十分薄弱的学科，不是到国外去学习在国内也可以学到的普通知识。还应该有计划地扩大派遣到资本主义国家去的留学生名额并大力争取现在在资本主义国家的留学生回来为祖国服务。
    为要使高等学校和中等专业学校有足够和良好的学生来源，必须更加注意发展和办好初级中学和高级中学，争取在今后几年内使高等学校招生数与高级中学毕业生之间的比例逐步地达到一比一点五到一比二；同时要努力提高中学教育的质量。
    为要完成培养干部的任务，还必须继续逐步地实事求是地改善高等学校的房舍教学设备等物质条件。
    正确地实行双重领导发挥各部门各地方的积极性
    为了加强对高等学校的领导，应当更加发挥各部门和各地方的积极性，正确地实行双重领导。高等教育部主要地直接领导综合大学以及与几个部门有关的各类多科性学院，其他学校则应当逐步地交给各业务部门或地方管理，并由他们负主要责任，高等教育部着重作方针政策和教学方面的领导，组织经验交流和提供必要的教材资料。为要发挥学校的主动性和创造性，为要减少上级领导机关的行政事务工作，加强对重要工作的领导，应该改变现在对高等学校各方面工作管得太多限制太死的情况，适当地扩大高等学校处理问题的权限。高等教育部要加强检查，深入下层，努力克服主观主义思想作风。所有从事教育工作的同志都必须响应党中央和毛泽东同志的号召，刻苦地学习科学，钻研业务，务必在尽可能短的时间内成为精通业务的专家，以便更有效地完成培养干部的任务。
    在知识分子中积极进行建党工作并注意发挥民主党派的作用
    应该按照党中央的指示，在知识分子中积极地进行建党工作，吸收够条件的人入党。这也是加强党对培养干部工作领导的一项重要措施。在这一工作中，要继续克服某些同志的关门主义偏向，同时也要防止降低标准，追求数量的片面任务观点。在高等学校应该注意发挥各民主党派的作用，认真贯彻“长期共存、互相监督”的方针，和他们密切合作，做好各项工作。
    最后，做好为国家培养建设人材的工作，加强党对于这方面工作的领导是有决定意义的。我们要像办好一个大工厂那样来办好一个大学校。我们知道，文化建设必须在经济建设发展的基础上，必须密切配合经济建设来进行，但是培养干部和科学研究工作又必须设法早走一步，才能对经济建设作更有效的服务。
