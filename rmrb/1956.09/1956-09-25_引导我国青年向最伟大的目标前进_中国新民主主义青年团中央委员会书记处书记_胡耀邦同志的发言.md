I fully endorse the reports made by Comrades Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, and Deng Xiaoping on behalf of the Central Committee. I believe that the Youth League organizations at all levels and the vast number of young people will enthusiastically study these reports, study the rich historical experience of our Party leading the people of the whole country in achieving two great revolutionary victories, and study the theories and policies for building our country into a great socialist state.

The Central Committee's report has given extremely high praise to the youth of our country and has also put forward higher demands on the Youth League. This is a great encouragement to the youth of the country and the League organizations. It has been eight years since the re-establishment of the Youth League organization. Looking back at the past eight years, the youth of the country have indeed done a lot of work, but as far as the leadership of the Youth League is concerned, we have only solved one and a half problems. One problem refers to the fact that we have established a national Youth League, and half a problem refers to the fact that we have only begun to explore some methods of working according to the characteristics of young people.

Adhering to the correct line of building the League: opposing both turning the League into a narrow youth organization and degrading the League into a general mass organization

In the youth movement, our Party has always believed that a core organization should be established that can unite and educate the vast number of young people. In the past, the revolutionary youth organizations led by our Party have attracted a large number of young people and made great contributions to the entire revolutionary cause. However, we have had two different lessons in organizational matters: The Communist Youth League during the domestic revolutionary war only emphasized the advanced aspect and ignored the mass aspect, resulting in closed-doorism and becoming a second party; the Youth Anti-Japanese Corps in the later period of the Anti-Japanese War, due to the lack of an advanced organization as a backbone, became loose and weak. Therefore, the Central Committee of the Party stipulated in the 1949 resolution on building the League that the current Youth League must be a mass organization of advanced young people under the leadership of the Party. For several years, we have always adhered to this correct line of building the League, opposing both turning the Youth League into a narrow youth organization and degrading the Youth League into a general mass organization. The development of the League is healthy, the thinking of the vast majority of League members is progressive, and the work is energetic. By the end of June this year, there were already 20 million male and female League members, accounting for almost 17 percent of the country's youth, with 700,000 grassroots organizations spread across all aspects of rural areas, factories, schools, state organs, and the armed forces. In the past eight years, 2.15 million League members have joined the Communist Party of China. Based on these facts, it is true to say that the Youth League is already a reliable reserve force of our Party and that this League has become a huge force attracting the youth of the country to forge ahead vigorously. On such an ideological and organizational basis, and when our country's socialist transformation has achieved a decisive victory, it is entirely in line with the wishes of the vast number of young people to change the New Democratic Youth League into the Communist Youth League.

At this conference, our Party included the relationship between the Party and the Communist Youth League in the new Party Constitution, which means that the Youth League will receive further care from the Party in terms of ideological and organizational work and in educating young people with communist spirit. This care from the Party will surely inspire all League members to work hard to improve their ideological awareness, participate more actively in socialist construction, and more bravely assist the Party in fighting to eliminate shortcomings and errors in their work.

Using methods suitable for the characteristics of young people to carry out independent activities that are both beneficial to the socialist cause and can give play to the enthusiasm of young people

In the past eight years, our Party has not only established a national Youth League, but also united the vast number of young people through this League to actively participate in the political, economic, and cultural life of the country and society, and at the same time, adopted methods loved by young people to carry out various independent activities. These activities are of two types: one is activities to help young people increase their knowledge and exercise their bodies, such as eliminating illiteracy, conducting communist moral education, organizing spare-time learning, organizing cultural and recreational activities, and organizing sports activities. The other, and also the main one, is the activity of increasing production and practicing thrift. For example, in the autumn and winter of last year and the spring of this year, 120 million young people participated in afforestation, planting more than 37 million mu of various trees, and the survival rate in most areas was higher than in previous years. For another example, last winter and this spring, 70 million rural youth participated in the manure accumulation movement, accumulating more than 800 billion jin of manure. During the same period, more than 100,000 young men and women across the country went to the border areas to participate in construction work, and there were nearly one million young people who applied to the Youth League committees at all levels but were not approved. There are 9,500 advanced youth groups in factories, mines, enterprises, and transportation departments, and 7,500 youth shock teams in basic construction. The male and female team members often exceed the general quotas, some even reaching five or six times. The recycling activities organized by several provinces last year recovered 106,000 tons of scrap steel. Since the launch of the campaign to save building materials this year, from June to September, young people in various places have saved 5,700 tons of steel and 18,000 tons of cement. Through these activities, the socialist enthusiasm of the young people has been enhanced, the relationship between the League and the masses has been strengthened, and the working ability of the Youth League cadres has been enhanced. This fully proves that the Party and Chairman Mao's instruction: "Carry out independent activities according to the characteristics of young people" is completely correct. It has found a way out for the problems that the Youth League has not solved for a long time.

However, in these activities, many problems and shortcomings have also emerged. Because some of our activities have not paid attention to consulting with the relevant departments and obtaining their support, sometimes the pace is not consistent with these departments; because we sometimes put forward demands that are too high and too urgent, and then the tasks are added layer by layer below, some things become unworkable, and even some compulsory phenomena occur; because we sometimes overemphasize the youth's vanguard role, "taking over everything," some young people are overworked, and the relationship between young people and middle-aged and old people is not coordinated. These shortcomings are the half problem that I mentioned above that has not yet been solved. Some of our comrades do not humbly listen to other people's opinions and do not face up to their own shortcomings, which is wrong. Other comrades, upon hearing criticism, regardless of whether it is right or wrong, rush to "withdraw their troops and return to court," conduct closed-door self-criticism, and even come to this "experience," called "do less work, make fewer mistakes," which is equally wrong.

Youth is a part of the entire people, and it is an army on one front of the entire revolutionary movement. Therefore, the youth movement must be consistent with the entire revolutionary movement in terms of direction and policy, which is one aspect. On the other hand, the youth movement is a special part of the entire people's movement. Young people have vigorous energy, have various interests and hobbies, and the youth period is the period with the most contradictions in their thinking. Problems that did not occur in adolescence may occur in them, and problems that adults have already solved, they have not yet solved. Because of this, the Youth League cannot lead young people with generalized methods. It is necessary to create some methods suitable for the characteristics of young people to give play to the socialist enthusiasm of young people, to meet the various progressive demands of young people, and to enable young cadres to increase their talents while doing their work. Carrying out independent activities that are both beneficial to the socialist cause and suitable for the characteristics of young people is completely different from making independence from the Party. Independence of activity must not be confused with making independence, and the vanguard role must not be confused with vanguardism.

Arming young people with the communist spirit, advocating the spirit of collective heroism of being brave in overcoming difficulties and building the country diligently and thriftily, and using persuasive education methods to promote the enthusiasm and initiative of young people

The Central Committee's report proposes to mobilize all positive factors to build our country into a great socialist country. This requires young people to make greater efforts and more contributions in this great struggle. We will hold a broad discussion on this issue at the upcoming Third National Congress of the League. Here, I would like to focus on the ideological education of young people and the issue of young people's spare-time learning.

Our Party regards raising young people's communist consciousness as the primary task of educating young people. In recent years, the Party has continuously educated young people: to love the motherland, to love the common cause of the people, to work diligently for socialism, to resolutely fight against phenomena that harm the interests of the people, to treat people of all ethnic groups like brothers and sisters, to love the international socialist family, and to work closely with the people of the world for the cause of human progress. These educations have promoted the rapid growth of communist ideas and moral ethos among young people in our country. Now, "Everything for socialism," "Where the motherland wants me to go, I will go," and "Fear no difficulties, march toward difficulties" have become the slogans of action for the vast number of young people. The spiritual outlook of young people in our country has undergone fundamental changes. Even foreign bourgeois journalists are surprised. They say, "Communism has found the greatest strength in Chinese youth," "These people have extremely commendable enthusiasm," and "They are full of confidence in themselves, in their motherland, and in the future of the whole world, and they are simply elated." In contrast to the aspiring and enterprising spirit of young people in our country, we see that the situation is different in capitalist countries. For example, according to information revealed by American officials, in their so-called most "civilized" country, two million teenagers under the age of eighteen are arrested each year for theft, robbery, and murder.

Of course, this does not mean that the entire spiritual outlook of young people in our country is perfect, nor does it mean that we have done a perfect job in communist education for young people. No, it is not. Because the ideas of various declining classes are still influencing our youth, and because building socialism is still an arduous struggle, we must continue to arm young people with the communist spirit, vigorously advocate the spirit of collective heroism of being brave in overcoming difficulties and building the country diligently and thriftily among young people, and be good at using persuasive education methods to promote the enthusiasm and initiative of young people. This is the fundamental policy of our Party in conducting ideological education for young people during the transition period. We must implement this policy. However, some of our comrades have not fully understood this policy, and therefore, there are still two main shortcomings in practical work: One is unclear boundaries. Individual interests and hobbies that do not violate collective interests at all are also excluded, and even some of the advantages of young people, such as being energetic, having ideals, liking to ask questions, and being active in thinking, are regarded as dirty water and poured out together with individualism. One is simple methods and eagerness for quick success. When dealing with backward young people, our comrades always hope that they can catch up with the advanced in one morning. If they cannot, they come to the pessimistic conclusion that "backward young people can make progress, and salted fish can swim." In dealing with young people's lives, they often interfere too much, arranging for young people when to play ball, watch movies, sing, and rest. The reason why these comrades do this is out of good intentions, hoping that young people can grow faster, but they do not understand that this approach restricts young people's enthusiasm. We must follow the instructions of the Central Committee of the Party, use more vivid ideological work to overcome this shortcoming of being divorced from the masses, combine discipline and creativity, and cultivate the ability of young people to live independently on the basis of collectivism, and give full play to young people's hobbies, specialties, and initiative.

Through various forms, help young people learn the skills to build socialism and modern culture, science, and technology knowledge

Another important issue in education is to lead young people to learn the skills to build socialism in a practical way, so that young people in our country not only have communist ideas, strong will and character, and strong physique, but also have the level of modern culture, technology, and scientific knowledge.

At present, the number of college and middle school students in our country has developed to more than 6 million, and the number of primary school students has developed to 57 million. This speed is very fast. However, most of the young people in our country have not yet gotten rid of illiteracy; the technical level of young workers is generally one and a half to two and a half levels lower than the production design requirements; and the number of college students is still very small. While expanding school education in a planned way, we must pay special attention to the development of spare-time education.

However, we have not seriously done such an important work as spare-time education. We have not deeply understood that raising the level of cultural and scientific knowledge is the most urgent requirement of young people after the victory of the revolution. The current generation of young people is the backbone of building communism in the future. If a solid foundation of knowledge is not laid now, great difficulties will be encountered at that time. Taking the current 8.5 million on-the-job young workers as an example, after the Central Committee of the Party held a meeting on the issue of intellectuals, their enthusiasm for learning culture and learning science and technology has been further increased, and the trend of humbly learning from experienced, knowledgeable, and skilled adults has also been further developed. These are all good news. However, they also look forward to being able to add necessary books and materials for them, establish spare-time continuing education organizations, and especially help them reduce part-time jobs and meetings and give them more time for continuing education. In the past few years, we have helped them with continuing education and established four effective forms: one is a regular spare-time school, one is a correspondence school, one is a spare-time study class, and one is a study group. Under the current conditions, the first and second forms can only be gradually promoted, but the third and fourth forms must be effectively promoted in order to promote the rapid growth of our country's young scientific and technical forces.

Another major task in spare-time education is to eliminate illiteracy. According to our recent survey, to do this work well, we must not only adopt the principle of adapting to local conditions and adapting to the times, but also add the principle of adapting to people. According to the rural situation, male and female farmers pass the youth stage, form a family, and raise children, and there are more household chores, which cannot but affect learning. Therefore, we must first eliminate the young illiterates who are active in learning and easy to eliminate as soon as possible, and do not force the adults and young people to advance side by side. In this way, most young people first get rid of illiteracy, and eliminating other illiterates can be faster. In addition, it is also necessary to strengthen specific leadership, which is to uniformly arrange time so that production and meetings do not often fight with learning. If this can be done, then it is possible to basically eliminate illiteracy among young people in seven years.

All of this requires the Youth League to improve its combat effectiveness, and the key to improving combat effectiveness is to strengthen our own learning. There are now more than 80,000 full-time cadres in the Youth League, and 80% of them have grown up after the national victory. Although our comrades have enthusiasm, are active in their work, and listen to the Party, they are young, have little experience, and lack experience, and their thinking often has one-sidedness, which is an important reason why our work often produces shortcomings and errors. To get rid of this predicament, we must strive to improve our level of Marxism-Leninism, be familiar with the Party's struggle experience, be familiar with the Party's policies, be familiar with the situation of young people in all aspects, and be familiar with the scientific knowledge related to our profession. At the same time, we also hope that our Party committees at all levels, as in the past, will put forward stricter requirements on us and implement stricter supervision from the perspective of love and cultivation.

Comrades, our Party is facing our great future with full confidence. Cultivating new people of socialism and developing the new economy of socialism are both fundamental tasks of our Party in the transition period, and they are closely related tasks. We believe that the whole Party will pay more attention to our future generation, guide them towards our greatest goals—socialism and communism, and advance victoriously. (Attached picture)

    引导我国青年向最伟大的目标前进
    中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会书记处书记　胡耀邦同志的发言
    我完全拥护刘少奇、周恩来、邓小平同志代表中央委员会所作的各项报告。我相信，青年团的各级组织和广大青年，一定会兴致勃勃地学习这些报告，学习我们党领导全国人民取得两个伟大革命胜利的丰富的历史经验，学习把我国建成一个伟大的社会主义国家的理论和政策。
    党中央的报告，对我国青年作了极高的估价，同时也给青年团提出了更高的要求。这对全国青年和团的组织是一个极大的鼓舞。重新建立青年团的组织已经八年了。回顾过去的八年，全国青年确实做了不少工作，但是就青年团的领导来说，我们还只解决了一个半问题。一个问题是指我们已经建立了一个全国性的青年团，半个问题是指我们才初步摸到了一些按照青年特点进行工作的方法。
    坚持正确的建团路线：既反对把团变为狭隘的青年组织，又反对把团降为一般性的群众团体
    在青年运动上，我们党一直认为应当建立一个能够团结和教育广大青年的核心组织。过去我们党所领导的革命青年组织，都曾经吸引了广大青年，对整个革命事业作了很大的贡献。但是在组织问题上，我们却有过两次不同的教训：国内战争时期的共产主义青年团，只强调先进性的一面，忽视了群众性的一面，结果产生了关门主义，成了第二党；抗日战争后期的青年抗日团体，又因为缺乏先进组织作骨干，结果流于松懈无力。所以党中央在一九四九年建团决议里就规定了，现在的青年团，必须是党领导下的先进青年的群众组织。几年来，我们一直坚持了这个正确的建团路线，既反对把青年团变成狭隘的青年组织，也反对把青年团降为一般性的群众团体，团的发展是健康的，绝大多数团员的思想是进步的，工作是有朝气的。到今年六月底，男女团员已经有二千万，差不多占到全国青年的百分之十七，有七十万个基层组织，遍布在农村、工厂、学校、国家机关和武装部队等各个方面。八年以来，已经有二百一十五万团员加入了中国共产党。根据这些，说青年团已经是我们党的一支可靠的后备队，说这个团已经成为吸引全国青年蓬勃向上的一个巨大的力量，是合乎实际的。在这样的思想基础和组织基础上，并且当着我国社会主义改造已经取得了决定性的胜利的时候，把新民主主义青年团改为共产主义青年团，是完全符合广大青年的愿望的。
    在这次大会上，我们党把党同共产主义青年团的关系写进新的党章，这意味着青年团在思想工作和组织工作方面，在以共产主义精神教育青年方面，都将得到党的进一步的关怀。党的这种关怀，一定会激励全体团员努力提高自己的思想觉悟，更加积极地参加社会主义事业，并且会更加勇敢地协助党为消除工作中的缺点和错误而斗争。
    运用适合青年特点的方法，开展既有益于社会主义事业又能发挥青年积极性的独立活动
    八年以来，我们党不仅建立了一个全国性的青年团，而且通过这个团团结着广大青年，积极地参加了国家的和社会的政治生活、经济生活和文化生活，同时又采取了为青年所喜爱的方法，开展了各种各样的独立活动。这些活动，一种是帮助青年增长知识锻炼身体的活动，例如扫除文盲，进行共产主义道德教育，组织业余学习，组织文化娱乐活动，组织体育活动等。另一种，也是主要的一种，是增产节约的活动。例如，去年秋冬两季和今年春季，就有一亿二千万个青少年参加植树造林，种植了各种树木三千七百多万亩，大部地区的成活率都比往年高。又如去冬今春，全国有七千万农村青年参加了积肥运动，积肥八千多亿斤。在同一时期，全国还有十几万名男女青年到边疆去参加建设工作，而向各级团委申请没有获得批准的，还有近一百万名青年。在工厂矿山企业和交通运输部门有了九千五百个青年先进班组，在基本建设里有了七千五百个青年突击队，男女队员们常常超过一般定额，有的甚至达到五、六倍。去年几个省所组织的回收活动，就收回了十万六千吨废钢铁。今年开展节省建筑材料的活动以后，从六月到九月，各地青年就已节约五千七百吨钢材和一万八千吨水泥。通过这些活动，提高了青年们的社会主义积极性，密切了团和群众的关系，锻炼了青年团干部的工作能力。这就充分证明党和毛主席所指示的：“按照青年特点，开展独立活动”的这个方针，是完全正确的。它给青年团长期以来没有解决的问题，找到了门路。
    但是，在这些活动中，也出现了不少的问题和缺点。由于我们有些活动没有注意同有关部门多加商量，取得它们的支持，有时就和这些部门的步调不够一致；由于我们有时提出的要求过高过急，到了下面又层层附加任务，就使得某些事情不大行得通，甚至发生一些强迫现象；由于我们有时过分强调青年打先锋，“包下来”，就使得一部分青年过分劳累，使得青年和壮年人老年人之间的关系不够协调。这些缺点，也就是我上面所说的还没有解决的半个问题。我们有些同志，不虚心听取别人的意见，不正视自己的缺点，这是不对的。另外一些同志，一听批评，不管对与不对，就赶紧“收兵回朝”，关门检讨，甚至得出这样一条“经验”，叫做“少做工作，少犯错误”，这同样是错误的。
    青年是整个人民群众中的一部分，是整个革命运动的一个方面军。因此，青年运动在方向上和政策方针上，必须同整个革命运动相一致，这是一方面。另一方面，青年运动又是整个人民运动的一个特殊部分，青年有着旺盛的精力，有着多方面的兴趣和爱好，而且青年时期又是思想上矛盾最多的时期，少年没有发生的问题，他们可能发生，成年人已经解决了的问题，他们还没有解决。正因为这样，青年团就不能用一般化的方法去带领青年，就要创造一些适合青年特点的方法，去发挥青年的社会主义积极性，去满足青年的各种进步要求，并且使青年干部在干的当中增长才能。开展既有益于社会主义事业又适合青年特点的独立活动，和向党闹独立性是完全不同的两回事。决不能把独立活动和闹独立性、把先锋作用和先锋主义混淆起来。
    以共产主义精神来武装青年，提倡勇于克服困难、勤俭建国的集体英雄主义精神，用说服教育的方法来发扬青年们的积极性和主动性
    党中央的报告，提出要调动一切积极因素，把我国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义国家。这就要求青年在这个伟大的斗争中，作更大的努力，有更多的贡献。对于这个问题，我们将在不久召开的第三次团的全国代表大会上展开广泛的讨论。这里，我只想着重谈谈青年的思想教育和青年的业余学习问题。
    我们党把提高青年的共产主义觉悟当作是教育青年的首要任务。几年来，党不断地教育青年：热爱祖国，热爱人民的共同事业，为社会主义勤勤恳恳地劳动，坚决地同损害人民利益的现象作斗争，像兄弟手足一样的对待各民族人民，热爱国际社会主义的大家庭，紧紧地同全世界人民一起为人类的进步事业而奋斗。这些教育，促使我国青年的共产主义思想和道德风气的迅速成长。现在，“一切为了社会主义”，“祖国要我到那里就到那里”，“不怕困难，向困难进军”，已经成为广大青年的行动口号。我国青年的精神面貌已经起了根本的变化。就连外国资产阶级记者也感到惊讶，他们说：“共产主义已经在中国青年中找到了最大的力量”，“这些人有着极其可以夸耀的热情”，“他们对自己，对自己的祖国和整个世界的未来充满着自信，简直是得意洋洋”。同我国青年这种奋发有为的积极精神相对照，我们看到，在资本主义国家里，却是另外一种情况。例如，据美国官方所透露的消息，在他们那个所谓最“文明”的国家里，一年就有二百万个十八岁以下的青少年因盗窃、抢劫、谋杀而被捕。
    当然，这并不是说，我国青年的整个精神面貌已经完美无缺，更不是说，我们对青年的共产主义教育已经做得尽善尽美，真的可以“得意洋洋”了。不是的。由于各种没落阶级的思想仍然在影响着我们的青年，由于建设社会主义还是一个艰苦的斗争，我们必须继续以共产主义精神来武装青年，必须在青年中大力提倡勇于克服困难，勤俭建国的集体英雄主义的精神，必须善于用说服教育的方法去发扬青年群众的积极性和主动性。这也就是我们党在过渡时期对青年进行思想教育的根本方针。我们必须贯彻这个方针。但是我们有些同志并没有完全弄清楚这个方针，因而在实际工作中还存在两个主要的缺点：一个是界限不清。把根本不违反集体利益的个人兴趣和个人爱好也加以排斥，甚至把青年的一些优点，例如有朝气，有理想，爱提问题，思想活泼等当作一盆脏水，同个人主义一起泼掉了。一个是方法简单，急于求成。在对待落后青年的问题上，我们的同志总是希望他们在一个早上就能赶上先进，如果不能，就得出悲观的结论说，“落后青年能够进步，咸鱼也能游泳。”在对待青年生活上，往往干涉过多，什么时候打球、看电影、唱歌、休息，都给青年加以安排。这些同志所以这样做，原是出于好心好意，希望青年能够更快地成长，可是没有了解，这种做法反而束缚了青年的积极性。我们必须遵照党中央的指示，用更生动的思想工作去克服这方面脱离群众的缺点，把纪律性和创造性结合起来，在集体主义的基础上，去培养青年独立生活的能力，充分地发挥青年的爱好、特长和主动精神。
    通过多种形式，帮助青年学到建设社会主义的本领和现代的文化、科学、技术知识
    在教育工作上的另一个重要问题，是要带领青年实实在在地学到建设社会主义的本领，使我国青年不单具有共产主义的思想，坚强的意志性格，和强健的体魄，而且具有现代的文化、技术、科学知识的水平。
    目前，我国的大中学生已经发展到六百多万人，小学生已经发展到五千七百万人，这个速度是很快的。但是我国青年大部分人还没有摆脱文盲状态；青年工人的技术水平一般要低于生产设计要求一级半到二级半；大学生的数目还很少。我们必须在有计划地扩大学校教育的同时，特别注意发展业余教育。
    但是对于业余教育这样一件重要的工作，我们还没有认真地做起来。我们还没有深刻了解，提高文化科学水平，是革命胜利以后青年最迫切的要求，现在这一代青年，是将来建设共产主义的中坚力量，如果现在不打下牢固的知识基础，那时便要遇到极大的困难。就拿现在八百五十万个在职青年职工来说，在党中央召开的关于知识分子问题会议以后，他们学习文化、学习科学技术的积极性，有了进一步的高涨，向有经验、有知识、有技术的成年人虚心领教的风气，也有了进一步的开展。这都是好消息。但是他们还盼望能够给他们添设必要的图书资料，建立业余进修组织，特别是帮助他们减少一点兼职和会议，多给他们一点进修的时间。过去几年，我们帮助他们进修，建立了四种有效的形式，一种是正规的业余学校，一种是函授学校，一种是业余学习班，一种是学习小组。在目前条件下，第一第二种形式只能逐步推行，但是第三第四种形式必须切实推广，以便促使我国年轻的科学技术力量迅速地生长起来。
    在业余教育方面另一个重大的任务，是扫除文盲。根据我们最近的调查，要把这件工作做好，不但要采取因地因时制宜的原则，还要加一条因人制宜的原则。按农村情况来说，男女农民过了青年期，成了家，养了儿女，家务事就多了，这就不能不影响到学习，因此必须首先把学习积极的、容易扫除的青年文盲早一些扫掉，而不要硬拉着壮年和青年齐头并进。这样，大部分青年首先脱离了文盲状态，扫除其他文盲就可以更快一些。此外，还必须加强具体领导，这就是要统一安排时间，不让生产、开会同学习经常互相打架。如果能够这样，那么在七年内基本上扫除青年中的文盲，是可以做到的。
    所有这一切，都要求青年团提高自己的战斗力，而提高战斗力的关键是加强我们自己的学习。现在青年团有八万多个专职干部，百分之八十都是全国胜利后生长起来的。我们这些同志虽然有热情，工作积极，也听党的话，但年纪轻，锻炼少，经验缺乏，思想往往存在着片面性，这就是我们工作中经常产生缺点和错误的一个重要原因。要摆脱这个困境，必须努力提高自己的马克思列宁主义水平，熟悉党的斗争经验，熟悉党的政策，熟悉各方面青年的情况，熟悉同本行有关的科学知识。同时也希望我们各级党委像过去一样，从爱护和培养的观点出发，对我们提出更严格的要求，实行更严格的督促。
    同志们，我们党正满怀信心地面对着我们伟大的未来。培养社会主义的新人和发展社会主义的新经济一样，都是我们党在过渡时期中带有根本性质的任务，而且是密切相关的任务。我们相信，全党一定会更好地关注我们未来的一代，引导他们朝着我们最伟大的目标——社会主义和共产主义，胜利前进。（附图片）
