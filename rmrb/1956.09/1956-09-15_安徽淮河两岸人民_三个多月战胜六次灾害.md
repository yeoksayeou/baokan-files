Xinhua News Agency, Hefei (via telegraph). Xinhua News Agency reporter Liang Jinduo reports: The tenacious struggle of the people on both sides of the Huai River in Anhui Province against natural disasters for more than three months has achieved initial victory. Currently, the more than 20 million mu of corn, sorghum, rice, millet, sweet potatoes, buckwheat, and other crops that were drained and replanted on both sides of the Huai River are starting to be harvested in some areas, while the crops in other areas are growing well. The ponds, dams, ditches, and dikes that were destroyed by the floods have also been basically repaired.

This year, the Huai River area of Anhui Province suffered severe waterlogging and typhoon disasters. In the first ten days of June, the Huai River area experienced continuous heavy rainfall. Because the rainfall was excessive and concentrated, the water levels of the main and tributary streams of the Huai River rose sharply, and the water in the inland rivers could not be discharged in time. Most of the farmland in the low-lying areas along the Huai River was flooded to a depth of one to three feet. At this time, more than four million agricultural cooperative members in the Huai River area mobilized more than 100,000 dragon-bone waterwheels, more than 60,000 water buckets, and a large number of pumps, working in shifts day and night. In less than 20 days, more than 90% of the flooded farmland was drained, and more than 35 million mu of wheat was reaped and more than 9 million mu of autumn crops were rushed to be planted.

In early August and late August, the Huai River area was again hit by strong typhoons and heavy rains, and most of the more than 20 million mu of sorghum, corn, rice and other crops that had been rushed to plant and replant were blown down, and more than 6 million mu were flooded again. At that time, the people in the Huai River area braved the wind and rain to carry out rescue operations. The Fuyang Prefecture mobilized more than 1.7 million people and used methods such as hilling, fertilizing and supporting, to straighten 80% of the fallen crops in two or three days.

In this way, the people in the Huai River area have successively overcome the disasters of five heavy rains and one typhoon in more than three months. Finally, crops were planted on most of the low-lying farmland in the Huai River area, and among the more than 20 million mu of autumn crops, more than 7 million mu had been planted two to four times.

The disaster situation in the Huai River area is still serious. At present, more than 4.5 million mu of farmland have not been drained and there will be no harvest in autumn. Therefore, the agricultural cooperatives in the Huai River area are continuing their efforts, busy with accumulating fertilizer, draining water, and transferring seeds, preparing to plant wheat; at the same time, according to the specific conditions of various places, they are organizing cooperative members to develop more than 100 kinds of sideline production for self-salvation through production.

The people in the disaster area along the Huai River have received strong support and care from the Party and the government in their struggle against natural disasters. According to the statistics of the Provincial Production and Disaster Relief Office as of September 10, more than 66 million yuan of relief funds, loans, and advance purchase grain deposits have been issued. The transportation departments mobilized nearly 100,000 workers and cadres to use more than 10,000 wooden boats, ships, and a large number of vehicles to transport large quantities of grain, seeds, coal, fertilizer and other materials to the disaster area in a timely manner.

    安徽淮河两岸人民
    三个多月战胜六次灾害
    据新华社合肥电　新华社记者梁金铎报道：安徽省淮河两岸人民，三个多月来与自然灾害进行的顽强斗争已获得初步胜利。现在，淮河两岸排涝补种的二千多万亩玉米、高粱、水稻、谷子、甘薯、荞麦等庄稼，早的已经开始收割，晚的生长得很好。被大水冲坏的塘坝、沟渠、堤防也已基本修复。
    今年，安徽省沿淮地区遭受了严重的内涝和台风的灾害。6月的头十天，沿淮地区连降暴雨，因为雨量过大和集中，淮河干支流水位猛涨，内河的水一时宣泄不出，沿淮低洼地区的农田大部积水一尺到三尺深。这时候，沿淮地区四百多万农业社社员，动用十万多部龙骨水车、六万多付水桶和大量抽水机，日夜轮番作战，不到二十天，受涝农田90％以上都排出了积水，三千五百多万亩小麦也抢收完毕，并抢种秋季作物九百多万亩。
    8月初和8月下旬，沿淮地区又遭受了强大的台风和暴雨的侵袭，抢种和补种上的两千多万亩高粱、玉米、水稻等作物大部被刮倒，六百多万亩再次受淹。当时，沿淮地区的人民冒着狂风暴雨进行抢救。阜阳专区动员了一百七十多万人，用壅根、培土、搭架等办法，两三天内，就把80％倒伏的庄稼扶直了。
    就是这样，沿淮地区人民在三个多月内，连续战胜了五次暴雨和一次台风的灾害。终于在沿淮地区的大部低洼农田上种上了庄稼，在两千多万亩秋季作物中，种过两次到四次的就有七百多万亩。
    沿淮地区的灾情仍然是严重的。目前，还有四百五十多万亩农田的积水没有排出，秋季无收。因此，沿淮地区的农业社正再接再厉，一面忙着积肥、排水，调运种子，准备种麦；一面根据各地的具体条件，组织社员开展起一百多种副业生产，进行生产自救。
    沿淮灾区人民在与自然灾害斗争中，得到了党和政府的大力支援和关怀。据省生产救灾办公室到9月10日的统计，已发放救济款、贷款、预购粮定金等六千六百多万元。交通运输部门动员起近十万工人和干部运用一万多条木船、轮船和大批车辆，及时地把大批粮食、种子、煤炭、肥料等物资运到了灾区。
