Xinhua News Agency, Xiao Ergou, 10th. The first and second sub-groups of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Delegation (formerly the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Minority Nationalities Delegation) are currently conducting in-depth visits to the Oroqen, Daur and other ethnic groups in the Greater Khingan Mountains region.

    After the first sub-group arrived in the Oroqen Autonomous Banner on August 21st, it divided into two groups to conduct activities deep in the mountains and forests. From August 22nd to September 7th, the film team performed fourteen film screenings for the Oroqen and other ethnic groups, with over 2,500 audience members. Doctors from the delegation provided free health check-ups and medical treatment to 189 Oroqen, Daur and other ethnic groups and cadres in Xiao Ergou and Nomin Nutuk (district), where the Banner People's Committee is located. The delegation's gifts of basketballs, volleyballs, accordions, and illustrated magazines have been presented to schools and organizations in the Oroqen Autonomous Banner. The delegation investigated and researched some issues in the economic development of the Oroqen ethnic group, and solicited opinions and requests on the work in ethnic minority areas at Oroqen forums. The Oroqen people requested that the government help them settle down as soon as possible, and requested the supply of mowing machines and other production tools. The delegation plans to submit these requests and opinions to the relevant departments for resolution. The group that went to Tozamin Nutuk discovered during their visit that the hunter Anzhulie often fell ill, affecting his hunting and causing financial difficulties, and immediately issued grain and money for relief; financial assistance was also decided for four hunter households without horses.

    The Oroqen people expressed their warm welcome and gratitude to the delegation. The old hunter, Guidebu, the head of the Oroqen Autonomous Banner, led a hunter group to kill fat roe deer to entertain the delegation. Guidebu also extended greetings to the delegation on behalf of all the Oroqen people in the banner, saying: "We are very grateful to the Party and the higher-level People's Government for their concern for us."

    The second sub-group is currently深入 to the upper reaches of the Nenjiang River and the lower reaches of the Nomin River to visit the Daur people. The Daur people specially made ancient ethnic food and performed ethnic songs and dances to welcome the delegation.
