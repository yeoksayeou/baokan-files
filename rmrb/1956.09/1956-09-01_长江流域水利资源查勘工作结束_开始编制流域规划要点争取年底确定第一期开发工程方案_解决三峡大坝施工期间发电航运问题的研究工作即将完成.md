Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 31st - The compilation of the key points for the comprehensive utilization and planning of the Yangtze River Basin has begun. Thousands of outstanding water conservancy workers are working intensely under the help and guidance of Soviet experts. They are striving to submit, by the end of this year, a plan for the development of sections of the Yangtze River's main stream and major tributaries, and to determine the first phase of construction projects for the Yangtze River.

The comprehensive utilization and planning work of the Yangtze River Basin began at the end of last year and is being carried out in cooperation with national economic departments such as water conservancy, geology, electricity, and transportation. Many famous engineers familiar with the Yangtze River and experienced technical personnel in hydrology, kinetics, geology, irrigation, and navigation are actively contributing their efforts. So far, the survey work of great significance to the development of water resources in the Yangtze River Basin (including key projects on the main stream and major tributaries, as well as navigation and irrigation aspects) has been completed. Hydrological data over the years in the Yangtze River Basin, from the Jinsha River in the upper reaches to the mouth of the Wusong River, have been compiled into volumes. The calculation of floods and analysis of flood characteristics in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River's main stream and tributaries, as well as the hydrological and hydraulic calculations of several larger key projects, have been preliminarily completed; now the work is turning to expanding hydrological and hydraulic calculations in the middle and lower reaches. For the planning and research of the famous Three Gorges of the Yangtze River and the Chongqing, Yibin and other water conservancy projects in the upper reaches, the staff is gradually narrowing the scope of comparison schemes and conducting in-depth and detailed research and comparison based on technical and economic feasibility and rationality. In order to solve the problems of power generation and navigation during the construction of the Three Gorges Dam in the future, the staff is gradually deepening the research on measures such as "cofferdam power generation" and "temporary ship locks." This extremely valuable research work will soon be completed. The volume of freight, navigation benefits, and land resources in the Yangtze River Basin have all been sorted out and studied. According to the different regions of the Yangtze River Basin, the staff is stepping up the research on different irrigation and drainage measures. The basin planning work of the major tributaries of the Yangtze River—Han River, Yuan River, Zi River, and Min River—is also being carried out intensively. The complex Han River basin planning work will be completed in early September. At present, the designers are selecting and comparing the dam site of the Danjiangkou Reservoir, the first phase of the Han River development project.

The comprehensive utilization and planning work of the Yangtze River Basin is huge in scale and technically complex, far exceeding the Yellow River and Huai River. As early as the early days of liberation, the state planned and prepared a large number of technical personnel. Over the past few years, with the development of water conservancy in the Yangtze River, this technical force has grown several times. At the same time, the state has organized surveying, mapping, geological drilling, hydrological measurement, and economic investigation in the Yangtze River Basin, as well as the sorting out and research of various data collected over the years. In the second half of last year, Soviet experts helping China plan the Yangtze River Basin began work. They and the Chinese staff have inspected the Yangtze River's main stream and many major tributaries several times, gradually becoming familiar with the natural characteristics and socio-economic conditions of the Yangtze River Basin. All of these are a strong guarantee for the smooth progress of the comprehensive utilization and planning of the Yangtze River Basin.

    长江流域水利资源查勘工作结束
    开始编制流域规划要点争取年底确定第一期开发工程方案
    解决三峡大坝施工期间发电航运问题的研究工作即将完成
    新华社武汉31日电　长江综合利用流域规划的要点的编制工作，目前已经陆续开始。成千上万优秀的水利工作者正在苏联专家的帮助和指导下紧张地工作着。他们争取到今年年底首先提出关于开发长江干流和主要支流的河段，以及确定开发长江的第一期工程的方案。
    长江综合利用流域规划工作从去年年底开始，是由水利、地质、电力、交通等国民经济部门配合进行的。许多著名的熟悉长江的工程师，有经验的水文、动能、地质、灌溉和航运等方面的技术人员，都积极贡献出自己的力量。到目前为止，对长江流域水利资源开发具有重大意义的查勘工作（包括长江干流和主要支流的枢纽工程、航运和灌溉等方面）已经结束。上起金沙江、下到吴淞口入海处的长江流域历年水文资料，已经整编成册。长江上游干支流洪水的计算和洪水特性的分析，以及几个较大枢纽的水文水利计算，都已经初步结束；现在正转向中、下游扩大水文水利计算工作。对著名的长江三峡和上游重庆、宜宾等水利枢纽的规划研究，工作人员正在根据技术上、经济上的可能性和合理性，逐步缩小比较方案的范围，作深入而细致的研究比较。为了解决三峡大坝将来施工期间的发电、航运等问题，工作人员正在逐步深入研究“围堰发电”和“临时船闸”等措施。这项极有价值的研究工作不久就要完成。长江流域的货运量、航运效益和土地资源情况，都已经整理研究完毕。根据长江流域不同的地区，工作人员正在加紧研究不同的灌溉和排水的措施。长江主要支流——汉水、沅水、资水和岷江的流域规划工作，也都在加紧进行。复杂的汉水流域规划工作将在9月上旬完成。现在设计人员正在对开发汉水的第一期工程中丹江口水库的坝址加以选择比较。
    长江综合利用流域规划工作规模巨大，技术复杂，大大超过了黄河和淮河。早在解放初期，国家就有计划地准备了大批技术力量。几年来，随着长江水利事业的发展，这支技术力量已经增长了好几倍。同时，国家组织了在长江流域进行查勘、测量、地质钻探、水文测量和经济调查，以及对历年搜集的各项资料的整理和研究工作。去年下半年，帮助中国规划长江流域的苏联专家开始工作。他们和中国的工作人员先后几次查勘了长江干流和许多主要支流，逐渐熟悉了长江流域的自然特征和社会经济条件。所有这些，都是顺利进行长江综合利用流域规划工作的有力保证。
