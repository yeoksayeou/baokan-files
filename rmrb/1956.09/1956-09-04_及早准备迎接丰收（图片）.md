Preparing Early to Welcome the Harvest

One of China's famous rice-producing areas, the western Sichuan Plain, has over six million mu of rice fields, now a golden "sea of rice." It is estimated that this year's production will increase by about 10% compared to last year. This is the seventh consecutive year of abundant harvests in the western Sichuan Plain since liberation.

Currently, agricultural cooperatives, grain management, supply and marketing departments on the western Sichuan Plain are actively preparing for the autumn harvest to welcome the bumper crop.
