    Mr. Lu Xun and Classical Opera
    Xu Gan
    (II)
    In "The Art of the Supporting Clown," Mr. Lu Xun describes the *erchou* (supporting clown) character with such meticulous detail: “Their status is higher than that of the small clown, but their character is worse. … They somewhat resemble the upper class, understand some music, chess, calligraphy, and painting, and can play drinking games and riddles, but they rely on powerful families and despise the common people. When someone is oppressed, they laugh coldly a few times to feel satisfied; when someone is framed, they scare them and shout a few times. However, their attitude is not always like this. Usually, they turn around and point out the shortcomings of their young master to the audience, shaking their heads and making faces, saying: Look at this fellow, he is going to be in trouble this time! This last trick is the specialty of the *erchou*. … This painted-face character is the essence of what the common people see in these people, extracted and formed into a role.”
    These words, of course, are Mr. Lu Xun’s heartfelt remarks, and they are truly insightful. If one did not see people so clearly, and hate this kind of person in the real life of the old society as deeply as Mr. Lu Xun did, one could not say it; if Mr. Lu Xun did not deeply understand opera and deeply love the people and folk artists who created this role, one could not say it either. And the last trick that most vividly portrays the character of the *erchou* is concentratedly expressed in the old Ding in this play "Garden Tour and Beating." When the young master is being whipped, he says to the audience: "Look at this fellow, he's going to be in trouble this time."
    I don’t want to conclude from this that the essay “The Art of the Supporting Clown” originated from the impression that this play made on the eleven- or twelve-year-old author that night. But if we say that Mr. Lu Xun watched a lot of operas in his hometown during his childhood and adolescence, and that this became one of the sources of his many outstanding works, I don't think it's presumptuous. This can make us understand a principle even more clearly: for writers and thinkers, all works of art, especially folk art, provide rich nourishment.
    "Dawn Blossoms Plucked at Dusk"’s "Impermanence" and "Qiejieting Essays" (final compilation)'s "Female Ghost" are both proofs. When Mr. Lu Xun satirized the unsalable publications run by Kuomintang pro-government literati, he also quoted the Shaoxing people's rhyme ridiculing opera troupes that no one wanted to see:
    On stage, the Qunyu Troupe,
    Off stage, everyone scatters…
    Quickly grab it tight,
    Only a wonton noodle stall remains.
    And a more powerful proof is the line of opera that Ah Q had on his lips in "The True Story of Ah Q": "Wielding a steel whip, I will strike you."
    This sentence comes from the opera "Dragon and Tiger Fight." There is also a Beijing opera called "Dragon and Tiger Fight," which is a duet between Zhao Kuangyin and an eleven-year-old child when the child nearly kills Zhao Kuangyin. The Beijing opera that entered the Qing Palace is probably very different from Shaoxing opera. That child was the son of the loyal minister Huyan Shouting, who was killed by Zhao Kuangyin after listening to the slander of the traitor Ouyang Fang, who was in league with foreign countries. He was originally a mute, but after hearing the bad news of his father's murder, he opened his mouth in anger. He was taught by a strange man, and used a bamboo steel whip to beat the founding emperor of the Song Dynasty so badly that he had to beg for mercy in every possible way. The lyrics of the Shaoxing opera are like this—
    Zhao: Young general!
    If you can guarantee that I will return to the court,
    I will divide the country with you four to six!
    Hu: No!
    Zhao: I will divide the country equally with you?
    Hu: No!
    Zhao: Fine, fine, you be the emperor and I will be the minister!
    Hu: No!
    No, no, no, three no's,
    I only want the life of the fatuous emperor!
    Wielding a steel whip, I will strike you,
    Strike the fatuous emperor to avenge my father's life!
    From this, it can be seen that Mr. Lu Xun's choice of this line of opera for Ah Q, who "has long wanted revolution," to hang on his lips was by no means arbitrary.

    鲁迅先生和经典戏
    徐淦
    （二）
    在“二丑艺术”里，鲁迅先生这样细致地描述二丑：“身分比小丑高，而性格却比小丑坏。……他有点上等人模样，也懂些琴棋书画，也来得行令猜谜，但倚靠的是权门，凌蔑的是百姓。有谁被压迫了，他就来冷笑几声，畅快一下；有谁被陷害了，他又去吓唬一下，吆喝几声。不过他的态度又并不常常如此的，大抵一面又回过脸来，向台下的看客指出他公子的缺点，摇着头装起鬼脸道：你看这家伙，这回可要倒楣哩！这最末的一手，是二丑的特色。……这二花脸，乃是小百姓看透了这一种人，提出精华来，制定了的角色。”
    这段话，自然是鲁迅先生有感而发的，说得实在精辟。倘不是看人看得透，对旧社会的实生活里的这一种人深恶痛嫉如鲁迅先生，就说不出；鲁迅先生倘不深懂戏文，深爱塑造了这种角色的人民和民间艺术家，也说不出。而最形象地刻划了二丑性格的那最末一手的，正是集中表现在这折“游园吊打”里的老丁身上，他当公子一下一下吃着马鞭的时候，就是这样向台下看客说：“你看这家伙，这回可倒楣了。”
    我并不想由此得出结论，说“二丑艺术”这篇杂文，就产生自那天夜里这折戏给十一二岁时的作者的印象。但如果说鲁迅先生童年少年时代在故乡看戏看得很多，这也成了他许多杰出的作品的泉源之一，我想是不算武断的。这可以使我们更加明白一个道理：对于文学家和思想家，一切艺术作品，特别是民间的艺术作品，都提供着丰富的养料。
      “朝华夕拾”里的“无常”，“且介亭杂文”（末编）里的“女吊”，都是佐证。鲁迅先生在讽刺国民党御用文人所办毫无销路的刊物时，也引用了绍兴人嘲笑无人要看的戏班子的歌谣：
    台上群玉班，
    台下都走散，……
    连忙扯得牢，
    只剩下一担馄饨担。
    而更有力的一个佐证是“阿Q正传”里阿Q挂在嘴边的一句戏词：“手执钢鞭将你打”。
    这一句，出在“龙虎斗”一戏。“龙虎斗”京戏也有，那是当赵匡胤被一个十一岁的娃娃杀得性命交关的时候，两个人的对唱，进过清宫的京戏恐怕与绍兴戏大不相同。那娃娃，是被赵匡胤听信里通外国的奸臣欧阳方的谗言而杀害的忠臣呼延寿廷的儿子，本来是个哑巴，听到父亲被害的恶耗，一怒开口，他得到异人传授，用竹节钢鞭杀得宋朝开国皇帝只好百般求饶，绍兴戏的唱词是这样的——
    赵：小将啊！
    你若保得寡人还朝转，
    我与你江山四六分！
    呼：不要！
    赵：我与你江山平半分？
    呼：不要！
    赵：罢罢罢，你做君来我做臣！
    呼：不要！
    不要不要三不要，
    只要昏君命一条！
    手执钢鞭将你打，
    打死昏君抵父命！
    由此可见，鲁迅先生选择这一句戏词让“久想革命”的阿Q挂在口边，决不是信手拈来的。
