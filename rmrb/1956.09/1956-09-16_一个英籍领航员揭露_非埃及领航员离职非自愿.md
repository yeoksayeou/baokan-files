Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, September 15th. According to the Indian Press Trust in Cairo: A British navigator told the Indian Press Trust reporter on September 13th that the departure of non-Egyptian navigators from their posts in the Suez Canal was not voluntary, but due to the order of the former Suez Canal Company.

According to this British navigator, most of the departing foreign navigators will not sell their properties in Egypt, but will leave these properties in Egypt. They will wait and see how the situation develops in the future, and then decide how to handle these properties.

He said that since the Suez Canal was nationalized by Egypt seven weeks ago, the canal has been operating as usual, and British and French navigators have been treated very well by the Egyptian authorities.

    一个英籍领航员揭露
    非埃及领航员离职非自愿
    新华社新德里15日电　据印度报业托辣斯开罗消息：一位英国籍领航员9月13日对印度报业托辣斯的记者说，苏彝士运河的非埃及籍领航员离开他们的工作岗位并非出于自愿，而是由于前苏彝士运河公司的命令。
    据这位英国领航员说，大多数离开的外籍领航员都不会出售他们在埃及的财产，而是把这些财产留在埃及。他们将等着瞧今后情况的发展，而后再决定如何处理这些财产。
    他说，自从七星期前苏彝士运河被埃及收归国有以来，运河一直在照常工作，英法籍领港员受到埃及当局很好的待遇。
