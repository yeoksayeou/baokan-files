    I completely agree with the political report of the Central Committee made by Comrade Liu Shaoqi, the report on the proposal for the Second Five-Year Plan for the Development National Economy made by Comrade Chou En-lai, and the report on the revision of the Party Constitution made by Comrade Deng Xiaoping.

    The summary of the work of our Party in the eleven years since the Seventh National Congress is a summary of the victory of the Chinese people. During this period, under the leadership of our Party, the people of our country united, went through arduous and complex struggles, achieved the great victory of the democratic revolution, and then basically achieved the great victory of the socialist revolution, and also achieved the great achievements of the first five-year plan for socialist construction.

    Because of these victories and achievements, the historical direction and social outlook of our country have been fundamentally changed. Our country, on the basis of realizing thorough national liberation, unification, people's democracy, and equality, unity, friendship, and mutual assistance among all nationalities in the country, is advancing vigorously on the road of socialism. Our economic and cultural undertakings have achieved rapid development, and our people are breaking away from extreme poverty and cultural backwardness and gradually obtaining significant improvements in their material and cultural lives year by year.

    Therefore, I believe that our Congress, all comrades of our Party, and the people of the whole country will evaluate the work of the Seventh Central Committee in the past eleven years with satisfaction.

    The political report of the Central Committee points out that the basic task now facing our Party and the people of the whole country is to build our country into a great socialist country.

    For this purpose, on the one hand, we must continue to complete the task of socialist transformation. This is still a huge project. Except for some minority areas including millions of people which will need a longer time, it may take several more years to fully complete the transformation from individual ownership by laborers to socialist collective ownership, and from capitalist ownership to socialist state ownership. In these areas, we need to do a lot of work and must do it very carefully. On the other hand, we must continue to carry out socialist industrialization. This is a more huge and more difficult project. This task requires us to strive to overfulfill the first five-year plan, and then complete the larger-scale second five-year plan. The Central Committee also proposed to basically realize the country's socialist industrialization during the third five-year plan period, and to catch up with the world's most developed capitalist countries in the level of industrial production in several decades. These great goals require us to make great efforts and overcome various difficulties to achieve them.

    Where are the difficulties for us to carry out socialist construction? The most fundamental difficulty lies in our economic and cultural backwardness. Our country was originally exploited very poorly by imperialism, and we are establishing a socialist family business on a very small inheritance.

    But can our task be completed? It can be completed, because we have all the favorable conditions necessary to build a great socialist country.

    **Expanding and Consolidating the Great Unity of the People of the Whole Country**

    Domestically speaking, our most important favorable condition is that we have the great unity of the people of the whole country under the leadership of our Party. This unity is based on the close alliance between workers and peasants. It also includes the national bourgeoisie, the upper petty bourgeoisie and their intellectuals, including the democratic parties and patriotic people without party affiliation, including all ethnic groups in the country and overseas Chinese. The unity of 600 million people is a great force. Relying on the strength of this great people’s unity, we achieved the great victory of the bourgeois democratic revolution. Relying on this people’s great unity, we also achieved the great victory of the socialist revolution. The close alliance between workers and peasants, due to the correctness of the political leadership of the working class realized by our Party and the infinite trust of the broad masses of peasants in the working class and our Party, is the most important reason for the rapid victory of the socialist transformation of agriculture in our country. The rapid victory of the socialist transformation of agriculture has consolidated the worker-peasant alliance on a new basis and provided a reliable guarantee for the socialist cause. At the same time, the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce in our country was carried out under the conditions of continuing to maintain the alliance with the national bourgeoisie and consulting with the national bourgeoisie. In this way, this revolutionary change can achieve victory by peaceful means. Our alliance with the national bourgeoisie can also enable their modern cultural and technical knowledge to serve the socialist cause. This is obviously very beneficial. Now, because the socialist transformation has been basically completed, the great unity of all ethnic groups in our country on the basis of the worker-peasant alliance has become more consolidated, and the scope of unity has been further expanded. Under the leadership of our Party and the people's government, the 600 million people of the country are united and working together with high enthusiasm and creativity to develop productivity. This is the most fundamental favorable condition for us to build a highly industrialized socialist country at a relatively fast pace.

    **Fully Utilizing the Favorable Conditions of Vast Land, Abundant Resources, and a Large Population**

    Our task is to fully utilize this favorable condition, fully utilize all the advantages of the socialist system, so as to strengthen the great unity of our people, develop the enthusiasm and creativity of the people of the whole country, and build socialism. In order to achieve this goal, we must properly handle the relationship between the people within our country, mainly the relationship between the working class and the peasants, the relationship between the working class and the bourgeoisie who are being transformed into laborers, and the relationship between all ethnic groups. We must continue to consolidate and expand our country's people's democratic united front, and closely unite all ethnic groups, people of all strata, democratic parties and non-party democratic people, and overseas Chinese around the Communist Party. We must also transform the people who originally belonged to the reactionary class and turn them from negative factors in building socialism into positive factors. In order to achieve this goal, we must also properly handle the relationship between national interests, cooperative interests and individual interests, the relationship between the central government and local governments, the relationship between industry and agriculture, the relationship between heavy industry and light industry, and the relationship between coastal industry and inland industry, because whether these relationships can be correctly resolved will ultimately affect the unity of the people within the country and the enthusiasm of the people. Finally, for all this, we must continue to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship and further develop the country's democratic life, because this is the most important guarantee for strengthening the great unity of the people and fully developing the enthusiasm and creativity of the people.

    Another important favorable condition for our country to build socialism is its vast land, abundant resources, and large population. Our country's industrial resources are very rich. In terms of heavy industry, the reserves of coal, iron, and various non-ferrous metals are particularly rich; in terms of light industry, the raw materials are relatively sufficient or can be greatly increased, and the market is also broad. In developing a diversified agricultural economy, our country has excellent geographical conditions that are rare in the world, and can plant various tropical, subtropical, and temperate crops, various useful and valuable native products, specialties such as silk, tea, medicinal materials, fruits, and so on. However, we have not yet fully utilized these abundant resources and favorable natural conditions. The large population is our country's largest productive force and our country's most valuable asset. In our country, there is no worry about a lack of labor force.

    Our task is to fully and rationally utilize our country's large number of laborers and semi-laborers to develop our country's rich resources. In order to achieve this goal, the central and local economic construction departments should conduct repeated investigations and studies, and constantly strengthen comprehensive planning; the state should adopt policies that encourage development of production as much as possible, fully mobilize the enthusiasm of various central departments and local levels, mobilize the enthusiasm of agricultural and handicraft production cooperatives, and even the enthusiasm of cooperative members’ families to carry it out. In short, on the basis of fully developing the superiority of the socialist economic system, fully utilizing our country's favorable conditions of vast land, abundant resources, and a large population, and actively developing production, so as to gradually achieve "making the best use of the land," "making the best use of people," and "making the best use of goods," should become a fundamental guideline for our socialist construction.

    **Implement the Principle of Diligence and Thrift in Management**

    We are in a period of establishing a socialist family business. How can we establish our family business? We must rely on hard work and thrift. Diligence and thrift are the inherent virtues of the working people of our country. The motto "Diligence and thrift, establish a family business" should now become a principle that every one of our state workers and economic workers must always remember and implement. The Party Central Committee has always required all comrades in our Party to maintain the fine style of hard struggle, and has repeatedly led the entire Party to carry out movements to practice thrift and oppose waste. Although these movements have achieved great results every time, it is a pity that serious phenomena of extravagant displays, emphasizing ostentation, and arbitrarily squandering the people's money are still found from time to time. We must mobilize the entire Party to resist this bad trend.

    I believe that as long as our Party is good at uniting the strength of the 600 million people of the country, mobilizing all the advantages of the socialist economy, utilizing all other favorable conditions that our country has, and implementing the principle of diligence and thrift in management, then all our difficulties can be overcome, and our goal of building a great socialist country will definitely be achieved.

    We still have the task of liberating our country’s sacred territory of Taiwan in front of us, so as to finally unify the motherland. As pointed out in the political report of the Central Committee, we will strive to liberate Taiwan through peaceful negotiations and as much as possible without using war, because this will be beneficial to the Chinese people (including the people of Taiwan Province) and the military and political personnel in Taiwan. We hope that the military and political personnel in Taiwan will bravely stand on the position of patriotism and return to the embrace of the motherland. As long as this is the case, their future will be bright. No matter what method is used, Taiwan must be liberated. Liberating Taiwan is a completely just cause for the Chinese people to exercise their national sovereignty, and this cause is bound to be victorious.

    **Unite All Peaceful and Democratic Forces in the World**

    In addition to domestic conditions, the current international conditions are also conducive to our socialist construction.

    We can see how huge and profound changes have taken place in the international situation since the last Congress of our Party. In the past eleven years, the broad masses of people in various countries around the world have achieved significant victories in the struggle against imperialism. Socialism has crossed the borders of one country. Socialist countries already have more than 900 million people, and they are geographically connected, forming a friendly and cooperative family headed by the Soviet Union. Due to the great development and victory of national independence movements, the shackles of imperialist colonial oppression have been broken in vast areas of Asia and Africa. The recent heroic move by Egypt to nationalize the Suez Canal Company has received strong support in Asia, Africa and other parts of the world, demonstrating that the huge wave of anti-colonialism is continuing to rise. On the other hand, the American reactionaries, who vainly attempt to dominate the world, are executing war policies that violate the people's desire for peace and interests, and are implementing policies of aggression and expansion against all countries. This has increasingly exposed themselves as the most ferocious enemy of the people of the world, thereby putting themselves in an increasingly isolated position. These circumstances have eased international tensions. Of course, we must not lose our vigilance against the danger of war. However, as long as our socialist countries and all peace-loving countries and peoples in the world continue to strengthen unity and continue to carry out resolute struggles to safeguard world peace and the cause of human justice, then the easing of the international situation that has already occurred may turn into lasting peace.

    **Strengthen the Party's Leadership and the Unity of the Entire Party**

    From everything said above, it can be seen that the current domestic and international conditions are very favorable for our socialist construction cause. The problem now finally boils down to the issue of our Party's leadership and the Party's own unity. As long as our Party can guarantee the correct leadership of Marxism-Leninism without making major mistakes, as long as our Party can maintain its own solid Marxist-Leninist unity, our Party will certainly be able to unite the 600 million people to victoriously realize the great task of socialist construction.

    Comrade Liu Shaoqi has given a detailed explanation in the political report on the question of how our Party can ensure that it makes few mistakes and does not make serious mistakes. I completely agree. We only need to accept the experience and lessons of past mistakes and correcting mistakes, adopt the method of rectification, adhere to the combination of theory and practice, and oppose subjectivism; adhere to the mass line of combining leadership and the masses, and oppose bureaucracy; adhere to the principle of democratic centralism, and the leadership principle of combining collective leadership and individual responsibility, and oppose decentralism and extreme democratization tendencies that violate democratic centralism, and oppose individual autocracy tendencies that violate the collective leadership principle; insist on continuously developing democracy and carrying out criticism and self-criticism within the Party and among the people, and oppose the tendency to suppress democracy and suppress criticism; insist on implementing the policies of "learn from past mistakes to avoid future ones, and cure the sickness to save the patient," "clarify thinking and unite comrades" and "starting from unity, going through criticism and struggle, to achieve unity" in intra-party struggle, oppose the liberal attitude towards intra-party errors, and oppose mechanical, rude, and excessive intra-party struggles; insist on the unity of the entire Party and the people of the whole country, and oppose sectarian tendencies; In short, as long as we can correctly apply the rich experience in party building that we have gained in the past 35 years in the new situation, we can prevent serious errors from occurring, and we can correct the errors that have already occurred in a timely manner, so that small errors do not become big errors, and temporary errors do not become long-term errors, ensuring the correctness of the Party's leadership and the Party's unity.

    In the arduous struggle to build socialism in China in the future, we must constantly strengthen the unity of all comrades in the Party. Because only when all comrades in our Party are firmly united on the basis of Marxism-Leninism can we unite the people of the whole country and fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the people of the whole country. Our enemies are most afraid of our unity, and they are always trying to undermine our unity. Therefore, all revolutionaries who are loyal to the cause of communism must regard maintaining the Party's unity and consolidating the Party's unification as their most important task. It must be pointed out that whether the Party can maintain solid unity is actually a major issue related to the success or failure of the revolution. In order to overcome the negative factors on our road to progress, we must call on everyone to further strengthen unity under the principles of Marxism-Leninism, and fight against all factors that are detrimental to the Party's unity. The new draft Party Constitution stipulates that maintaining the Party's unity and consolidating the Party's unification is the sacred duty of Party members, and is stipulated as an obligation of Party members. This is completely correct. The adoption of the new Party Constitution will greatly help eliminate any phenomena within the Party that harm the Party's unification and unity.

    We must oppose any kind of sectarian sentiment in intra-party relations. Every comrade must learn to unite with other comrades, especially to learn to unite with people who disagree with them. Because, it is not difficult or the key to establish a united relationship with people who often agree with themselves; it is difficult and important to implement unity with those who often disagree with them. Communists should be selfless people. For the greatest interests of the people, we have nothing that cannot be sacrificed. Communists have the weapon of Marxism-Leninism in their hands. We have no right or wrong that cannot be judged in accordance with principles. As long as everyone advocates the spirit of obeying the truth, any controversy can have a reasonable conclusion. Then, what reason do we have that we cannot unite? There are always disputes in work. It is not a bad thing, but it is inevitable in the process of work. Moreover, disputes over different opinions must not become a reason for affecting unity.

    Comrades, our Party is great, correct, and glorious. For 35 years, we have finally united a great Chinese nation that was in a state of division and oppression, and has grasped its own destiny. The eyes of the entire Chinese people are watching us, and the working people of the world are concerned about us. Our responsibility is extremely heavy. We must be conscientious and prudent, and guard against arrogance and rashness. Although our task is arduous, as long as we can strengthen unity within the Party, strengthen unity with the people of the whole country, we will certainly be able to realize the basic tasks of the entire Party at the present time that this Congress will stipulate, unite all forces that can be united at home and abroad, and fully utilize all conditions that are favorable to us, so as to build our country into a great socialist country.

### 加强团结，建设社会主义  朱德同志的发言

专栏：

    加强团结，建设社会主义
    朱德同志的发言
    我完全同意刘少奇同志所作的中央委员会的政治报告，周恩来同志所作的关于发展国民经济的第二个五年计划的建议的报告，和邓小平同志所作的关于修改党章的报告。
    我们党从第七次代表大会以来十一年的工作总结，是中国人民的胜利总结。在这个时期中，我国人民在我们党的领导下，团结起来，经过艰苦和复杂的斗争，取得了伟大的民主革命的胜利，接着，又在基本上取得了伟大的社会主义革命的胜利，并且取得了社会主义建设的第一个五年计划的重大成就。
    由于这些胜利和成就，我国的历史方向和社会面貌已经根本改变了。我国在实现了彻底的民族解放、统一、人民民主和国内各民族平等团结友爱互助的基础上，正在社会主义的道路上生气勃勃地前进。我国的经济和文化事业，获得了日新月异的发展，我国人民正在从极端贫困和文化落后的境地中挣脱出来，而逐年地获得了物质和文化生活的显著的改善。
    因此，我相信，我们的代表大会，我们全党同志和全国人民，将会以满意的心情来评价第七届中央委员会十一年来的工作。
    中央委员会的政治报告指出，现在摆在我们全党和全国人民面前的基本任务，就是要把我国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义国家。
    为了这个目的，一方面，我们要继续完成社会主义改造的任务。这仍然是一个巨大的工程。除开包含几百万人口的若干少数民族地区需要更长的时间以外，大概还要有几年的时间，才能全部完成从劳动者个体所有制到社会主义集体所有制的转变，和从资本家所有制到社会主义国有制的转变。在这些方面，都需要我们做许多的工作，必须很认真地小心谨慎地去做。另一方面，我们要继续进行社会主义工业化的建设。这是更加巨大和更加困难的工程。这个任务要求我们争取超额完成第一个五年计划，进而完成规模更大的第二个五年计划。中央委员会还提出，要在第三个五年计划期内基本上实现国家的社会主义工业化，并且要在几十年内在工业生产的水平上赶上世界工业最发达的资本主义国家。这些伟大的奋斗目标，需要我们作极大的努力，克服种种的困难，才能达到。
    我们进行社会主义建设的困难在哪里呢？最根本的困难，就是在于我们的经济落后和文化落后，我们的国家原来被帝国主义剥削得很穷，我们是在遗产很少的基础上建立社会主义家业的。
    但是我们的任务能不能完成呢？能够完成的，因为我们具备着为建成伟大的社会主义国家所必需的一切有利的条件。
    扩大和巩固全国人民的大团结
    就国内来说，我们最主要的有利条件，在于我们有全国人民在我们党的领导之下的大团结。这个团结，是以工农之间的亲密联盟为主体的，它还包括了民族资产阶级、上层小资产阶级和它们的知识分子，包括了各民主党派和无党派的爱国人士，包括了国内各民族和国外华侨。六亿人民的团结是一个伟大的力量。我们依靠这个人民大团结的力量，取得了资产阶级民主革命的伟大胜利。又依靠了这个人民大团结的力量，取得了社会主义革命的伟大胜利。亲密的工农联盟，由于我们党所实现的工人阶级政治领导的正确，和广大农民对工人阶级、对我们党的无限信任，是我国农业社会主义改造迅速胜利的最主要原因。农业社会主义改造的迅速胜利，使工农联盟在新的基础上巩固下来，使社会主义事业有了可靠的保证。同时，我国对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，是在和民族资产阶级继续保持联盟、在和民族资产阶级协商的条件下进行的。这样，就使得这个革命性的变革，能够以和平的方法取得了胜利。我们和民族资产阶级的联盟，还可以使他们的现代文化技术知识为社会主义事业服务。这显然是有很大好处的。现在，由于社会主义改造已经基本完成，我国各族人民在工农联盟基础上的大团结，已经更加巩固了，而且团结的范围更加扩大了。全国六亿人民在我们党的领导下，在人民政府的领导下，团结一致，以高度的积极性和创造性去发展生产力，这就是我们以比较快的速度来建成高度工业化的社会主义国家的最根本的有利条件。
  充分利用地大物博人多的有利条件
    我们的任务就是要充分地利用这个有利的条件，充分地发挥社会主义制度所具有的一切优越性，以便加强我们全国人民的大团结，发扬全国人民的积极性和创造性，来建设社会主义。为了达到这个目的，我们就要很好地处理我国人民内部的关系，主要是工人阶级和农民之间的关系，工人阶级同正在被改造成为劳动者的资产阶级之间的关系，各族人民之间的关系。就要继续巩固和扩大我国的人民民主统一战线，把国内各民族、各阶层人民、各民主党派和无党派民主人士以及国外华侨，紧紧地团结在共产党的周围，我们还要把原来属于反动阶级的人们改造好，把他们从建设社会主义的消极因素变为积极的因素。为了达到这个目的，我们还要很好地处理国家利益、合作社利益同个人利益之间的关系，中央同地方的关系，工业同农业的关系，重工业同轻工业的关系，沿海工业同内地工业的关系，因为这些关系能否正确地解决，归根结蒂是影响到人民内部的团结，影响到人民群众的积极性的能否充分发扬的。最后，为着这一切，我们就必须继续巩固人民民主专政，进一步发展国家的民主生活，因为这是加强全国人民的大团结，充分发扬全国人民的积极性和创造性的最重要的保证。
    我国建成社会主义的另一个重要的有利的条件，就是地大物博和人口众多。我国的工业资源是很丰富的。就重工业来说，煤、铁和各种有色金属的蕴藏量尤其丰富；就轻工业来说，原料是比较充足的或者是可以大大增产的，市场也是广阔的。在发展多种经营的农业经济方面，我国具有世界上少有的优良的地理条件，可以种植各种热带、亚热带和温带的作物，各种有用的和贵重的土产、特产如丝、茶、药材、水果等等。但是，这些丰富的资源和有利的自然条件，我们还远远没有充分地加以利用。众多的人口，是我国最大的生产力，是我国最宝贵的财产，在我们的国家里，是不愁没有劳动力的。
    我们的任务就是要充分地合理地利用我国众多的劳动力和半劳动力去开发我国的丰富的资源。为了达到这个目的，中央和地方的经济建设部门，应当反复进行调查研究，不断加强全面规划；国家应当采取尽量鼓励发展生产的政策，充分地动员中央各部门和地方各级的积极性、动员农业和手工业生产合作社的积极性以至合作社社员家庭的积极性去进行。总之，在充分地发挥社会主义经济制度的优越性的基础上，充分地利用我国地大物博、人口众多的有利条件，积极地发展生产，以便逐步地做到“地尽其利”、“人尽其力”和“货尽其用”，应当成为我们建设社会主义的一项根本的方针。
    贯彻执行克勤克俭的经营原则
    我们正处在创立社会主义的家业的时期。我们要怎样才能把我们的家业创立起来呢？要靠勤劳，还要靠节俭。勤俭是我国劳动人民固有的美德。“克勤克俭，成家立业”的格言，现在应当成为我们每一个国家工作人员和经济工作人员必须时刻牢记和贯彻执行的原则。党中央一向要求我们全党的同志保持艰苦奋斗的优良作风，并且多次领导全党开展了厉行节约、反对浪费的运动。这些运动，虽然每一次都收到了很大的成效，但遗憾的是，铺张门面、讲究排场、随便挥霍老百姓的金钱的严重现象，仍然时有发现。我们必须动员全党来抵制这种不良的倾向。
    我相信，只要我们党善于团结全国六亿人民的力量，动员社会主义经济所具有的一切优越性，利用我国所具有的一切其他有利条件，并且贯彻执行勤俭经营的原则，那么，我们的一切困难都是可以克服的，我们要建成一个伟大的社会主义国家的目的，一定能够达到。
    我们面前还有解放我国的神圣领土台湾，以便最后地统一祖国的任务。如同中央委员会的政治报告所指出，我们将争取用和平谈判的方式、尽可能地争取不用战争的方式解放台湾，因为这对于中国人民（包括台湾省的人民），和台湾的军政人员，都将是有利的。我们希望台湾的军政人员勇敢地站到爱国主义的立场上来，回到祖国的怀抱中来。只要这样，他们的前途就是光明的。不管是用什么方式，台湾是一定要解放的。解放台湾是中国人民行使自己国家的主权的完全正义的事业，这个事业是必然要获得胜利的。
    团结全世界一切和平民主力量
    除开国内的条件以外，目前的国际条件，对于我们的社会主义建设也是有利的。
    我们可以看到，自从我们党上一次代表大会以来，国际局势发生了多么巨大而深刻的变化。在过去的十一年间，世界各国广大的人民，已经在反对帝国主义的斗争中取得了重大的胜利。社会主义已经越出了一国范围，社会主义国家已经拥有九亿多人口，并且在地理上联成一片，组成了以苏联为首的友好合作的大家庭。由于民族独立运动的巨大发展和胜利，帝国主义的殖民压迫的枷锁，已经在亚洲和非洲的广大的地区内被打破了。最近埃及把苏彝士运河公司收归国有的英勇举动，在亚洲、非洲和世界其它各地获得了有力的支持，说明了规模巨大的反殖民主义斗争的浪潮，正在继续高涨着。另一方面，妄想统治世界的美国反动派，却因为执行违反人民的和平愿望和利益的战争政策，执行针对一切国家的侵略和扩张政策，日益暴露自己是全世界人民最凶恶的敌人，因而使它自己陷入愈来愈孤立的地位。这些情况，就使得国际紧张局势有了和缓。当然，我们不能丧失对于战争危险的警惕性，但是，只要我们社会主义各国和世界上一切爱好和平的国家和人民继续加强团结，并且为维护世界和平和人类正义事业而继续进行坚定的斗争。那么，目前已经出现的国际局势的和缓，就有可能转变为持久的和平。
    加强党的领导和全党的团结
    从上面说过的一切，可以看到：目前的国内条件和国际条件，对于我们的社会主义建设事业是十分有利的。现在的问题就最后地归结到我们党的领导和党本身团结的问题了。只要我们党能够保证马克思列宁主义的正确领导而不犯重大的错误，只要我们党能够保持自己队伍本身的马克思列宁主义的巩固的统一和团结，我们党就一定能够团结六亿人民胜利地实现社会主义建设的伟大任务。
    关于我们党如何能够保证少犯错误和不犯严重错误的问题，刘少奇同志在政治报告中已经作了详细的说明，我都完全同意。我们只要接受过去犯错误和改正错误的经验教训，采取整风的方法，坚持理论和实践相结合，反对主观主义；坚持领导和群众相结合的群众路线，反对官僚主义；坚持民主集中制的原则，和集体领导同个人负责相结合的领导原则，反对违反民主集中制的分散主义和极端民主化的倾向，反对违反集体领导原则的个人专断的倾向；坚持在党内和在人民中不断地发扬民主和开展批评和自我批评，反对压制民主和压制批评的倾向；坚持在党内斗争中实行“惩前毖后，治病救人”、“既要弄清思想，又要团结同志”和“从团结出发，经过批评和斗争，达到团结”的方针，反对对待党内错误的自由主义态度，反对机械的、粗暴的、过火的党内斗争；坚持全党和全国人民的团结，反对宗派主义的倾向；总之，我们只要能够在新的情况下，正确运用我们三十五年来所获得的丰富的建党经验，我们就能够防止发生严重的错误，就能够及时地纠正已经发生的错误，使小错误不致变成大错误，使暂时的错误不致变成长期的错误，保证党的领导的正确和党的统一和团结。
    我们在今后为在中国建成社会主义的艰巨的斗争中，必须不断加强全党同志的团结。因为只有我们全党同志在马克思列宁主义的基础上坚强地团结起来，才能把全国人民团结起来，把全国人民的积极性充分地动员起来。我们的敌人最害怕我们的团结，并且总是处心积虑地想要破坏我们的团结。因此，一切忠于共产主义事业的革命者，必须把维护党的统一和团结，作为自己最重要的一项任务。必须指出，党能否保持巩固的统一和团结，实际上是一个关系到革命成败的大问题。为了克服我们前进道路上的消极因素，我们必须号召大家在马克思列宁主义的原则下进一步加强团结，并且向一切不利于党的统一和团结的因素作斗争。这次新党章草案中，规定维护党的团结、巩固党的统一是党员的神圣职责，并且规定为党员的一项义务。这是完全正确的。新党章的通过，将会大大有助于消除党内的任何损害党的统一和团结的现象。
    我们必须反对在党内关系上任何种类的宗派主义情绪，每个同志都要学会和其他同志团结，特别要学会和自己意见不一致的人团结。因为，对于经常和自己意见一致的人，建立团结的关系并不是困难的，也不是问题的关键；困难和重要的，正是要和那些经常和自己意见不一致的人实行团结。共产主义者应当是没有私心的人，为了人民群众的最大利益，我们没有任何东西不可以牺牲，共产主义者手中有马克思列宁主义的武器，我们没有任何的是非不能得到合乎原则的判断。只要大家都提倡服从真理的精神，任何争论都可以有合理的结论，那么，我们之间还有什么不能团结起来的理由呢？工作中的争论总是有的，它并不是坏事，而是工作前进过程中必然不断发生的。而且，不同意见的争论，决不能成为影响团结的理由。
    同志们，我们的党是伟大的、正确的、光荣的，三十五年来我们终于把一个处在分裂和被压迫状态中的伟大的中华民族团结起来，掌握了自己的命运。全中国人民的眼光注视着我们，全世界劳动人民都关怀着我们，我们的责任是极重大的。我们必须兢兢业业，戒骄戒躁。我们的任务虽然艰巨，只要我们能够加强党内团结，加强和全国人民的团结，我们一定能够实现这次大会将要规定下来的全党现时的基本任务，团结国内外一切可能团结的力量，充分利用一切对我们有利的条件，把我国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义国家。
