    I completely agree with and support Chairman Mao's opening address, and the reports made by Comrades Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, and Deng Xiaoping at this conference. I also guarantee to actively work hard in future practical work to implement the various resolutions of this Party Congress.

    I am a riveter with over 30 years of experience, and the organization has now assigned me to be the deputy head of the technical inspection section of the Dalian 401 Factory.

    When I first took on this job, the Party told me, "To be an excellent technical inspector, you must not only be responsible to the country, but also to the masses. You must adhere to product standards while also paying attention to bringing out the enthusiasm of the masses." For several years, I have been wholeheartedly striving to work in the direction indicated by the Party.

    To be responsible to the country, we must adhere to product quality standards and oppose any shoddy or perfunctory phenomena. To achieve this, I not only work hard to learn, master technology, and become familiar with the structure and performance of products, but also pay attention to understanding the technical level of workers and clarifying which production groups have low skills and are prone to producing defective products, and which workers have relatively backward thinking and may be perfunctory. This gives me a clear understanding, making it easier to inspect and help workers improve their skills.

    To bring out the enthusiasm of the masses is not to lower quality standards to cater to the masses, but to think of all ways to help the masses prevent and reduce the production of defective products. Our technical inspection work is mainly based on prevention, adopting intermediate inspection and process inspection methods. I often take the initiative to go deep into the production process for frequent inspections, promptly pointing out possible errors in the work to the workers, and proposing methods and measures for improvement. This prevents the production of defective products before they occur, avoiding the practice of "only inspecting and finding faults, without preventing or helping" after the defective products have occurred. The workers all agree with this approach and welcome the opinions put forward by the inspectors. They say, "Thanks to the inspector for reminding us, otherwise it would have been bad." This ensures that the country does not suffer losses and the masses are happy.

    Since I started doing technical inspection work, I have always paid attention to helping workers improve their technical skills. I often use the good experiences of groups and individuals with excellent product quality to teach groups and individuals with poorer skills, helping everyone jointly improve product quality, because many rework and defective products are not caused by workers' intentional perfunctory behavior, but some are caused by workers' low technical skills. For example, in the past, the quality of the riveters' workshop's flower hole riveting was very low and always unqualified. Later, I helped them learn the operating experience of the Li Chenglong team and advanced Soviet calculation methods, and the product quality was greatly improved.

    In daily inspection work, I often publicize the importance of improving product quality to the workers. For example, when dealing with a defective product, I not only pay attention to helping workers improve technically, but also pay attention to educating and enlightening workers to raise their awareness, so that they realize the importance of improving product quality.

    Relying on the organization and relying on the masses is the foundation for doing all work well. I often use this ideological style taught by the Party to examine myself. I often report product quality and workers' ideological situation in production to the Party organization to obtain the Party's leadership and supervision; I often solicit the opinions of the masses so that technical inspection work can be supervised and supported by the broad masses of Party members and the masses.

    In my work, I help the masses solve difficult problems in product quality, and the masses have also given me a lot of help in my work. They tell me where there may be loopholes and where strict inspection is needed. I am from a riveting background and am not very proficient in machinery, forging, and casting. When problems arise in the quality of mechanical processing and forged and cast parts, I humbly ask the masses for advice, absorb the wisdom of the masses, and study with veteran workers and technicians. For example, the color quality of the galvanizing work in the foundry workshop was always not up to standard. I remembered that there was an old worker in another workshop who had expertise in this area, so I took the initiative to ask him for advice, and finally solved this quality problem with his help.

    The Party often teaches me: Never be satisfied with existing achievements in order to progress. Under the Party's cultivation and education over the past few years, although I have accumulated some experience in practical work, I am still far from the requirements of the Party and the country. My study of political theory and technical theory is still not enough; my organizational leadership ability is very poor, and I have not fully brought out the enthusiasm of all members of the department; in specific inspection work, there are still problems of not being meticulous and strict enough, so rework and defective products are still constantly produced. These all require me to continue to make unremitting and redoubled efforts in the future.

    Listening to the reports of the responsible comrades of the Party Central Committee at this conference has given me a great education. I am determined to, under the leadership of the Party, work with all Party members and workers of the Dalian 401 Factory to confidently undertake the glorious tasks entrusted to us by the Party and strive to accelerate the socialist industrialization of the motherland!

    Editor's note: Sun Hanzhang, Zeng Xisheng, Li Xian, and Wu Jinghua also spoke at the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China on the 17th. Due to space limitations, their speeches will be postponed to tomorrow. The titles and subheadings of the above representatives' speeches are added by the editor of this newspaper.

### 依靠组织，依靠群众，是做好一切工作的基础  赵成满同志的发言

    依靠组织，依靠群众，是做好一切工作的基础
    赵成满同志的发言
    我完全同意和拥护毛主席的开幕词、刘少奇同志、周恩来同志、邓小平同志在这次大会上所作的报告，并且保证在今后实际工作中积极努力，贯彻实现这次党代表大会的各项决议。
    我是一个有三十多年工龄的铆工工人，现在组织上分配我担任大连401厂技术检查科的副科长。
    在我一开始担任这个工作的时候，党就对我说：“要做一个优秀的技术检查工作者，不仅要对国家负责，同时也要对群众负责。既要坚持产品的标准，同时也要注意发挥群众的积极性”。几年来，我是一心一意地遵循着党所指示的这个方向努力工作的。
    要对国家负责，就要坚持产品的质量标准，反对任何凑付胡弄的现象。为了作到这一点，我不仅努力学习，掌握技术和熟悉产品的结构与性能，同时还注意了解工人的技术水平，弄清楚那些生产组技术低，容易出废品，那些工人思想比较落后，可能凑付胡弄。这样，我心里就有了底，便于检查和帮助工人提高技术。
    要发挥群众的积极性，并不是要降低质量标准去迎合群众，而是要想一切办法帮助群众，防止和减少废品的产生。我们的技术检查工作是以预防为主，采取中间检查和工序检查的方法，我经常主动地深入到生产过程中勤检勤查，及时给工人指出工作中可能发生的差错，并且提出改进的方法和措施，在废品没有产生以前就防止了废品的产生，避免了等到废品发生以后才去检查和那种“光检查挑毛病，不预防不帮助”的做法。工人都赞成这种做法，对检查人员提出的意见也都表示欢迎。他们说“多亏检查员这么一提醒，否则就坏了”。这样就做到国家不受损失，群众也高兴。
    我作技术检查工作以来，经常注意帮助工人提高技术水平，常常拿产品质量优秀的小组和个人的好经验来教给技术较差的小组和个人，帮助大家共同提高产品质量，因为有许多返手活和废品并不是因为工人有意的凑付胡弄，有些则是由于工人的技术水平低造成的。例如过去铆工车间工人上板绞花眼的质量都很低，老是不合格，以后我帮助他们学习了李成隆小组的操作经验和苏联的先进计算方法，产品质量就有了很大的提高。
    在日常检查工作中，我经常向工人宣传提高产品质量的重要性，比如在处理某一件废品的时候，我不仅注意帮助工人在技术上提高，同时也注意教育和启发工人提高觉悟，使他们认识到提高产品质量的重要意义。
    依靠组织，依靠群众，是做好一切工作的基础。我经常以党所教导我的这种思想作风来检查自己。经常向党组织汇报产品质量情况和工人在生产中的思想情况，取得党的领导和监督；经常征求群众的意见，使技术检查工作得到广大党员和群众的监督和支持。
    我在工作中帮助群众解决产品质量上的困难问题，群众在工作中也给了我很多帮助，他们告诉我那些地方可能有漏洞，那些地方需要严格检查。我是铆工出身，对机械、锻造、铸造等方面不太内行，碰到机械加工、锻铸件的质量上出了问题的时候，我就虚心向群众请教，吸取群众的智慧，同老工人、技术人员一块来研究。例如铸工车间镀锌工作的色泽质量老是不合规格，我想起另一个车间有一个老工友对这方面有特长，就主动地向他请教，终于在他的帮助下解决了这个质量上的问题。
    党时常教导我：永远不要满足于既有的成绩才能进步。几年来我在党的培养教育下，虽然在实际工作中积累了一些经验，但离党和国家的要求还差的很远。我对政治理论和技术理论学习还很不够；组织领导能力很差，还没有把全科人员的积极性都充分地发挥起来；在具体检查工作中，有时还存在工作不细致、不严格的毛病，因而返手活和废品还不断产生。这些都还需要我今后继续不懈地加倍努力。
    在这次大会上听了党中央负责同志的各项报告，给了我很大教育。我决心在党的领导下，同大连401厂的全体党员和工人一道，满怀信心地担负起党交给我们的光荣任务，为加速祖国的社会主义工业化而奋斗！
