　　He said that in Munich alone, 30 people join the organization every week. He also said that they are preparing to establish many advisory offices for young people reaching conscription age, and the work of these advisory offices is to discuss the possibility of refusing military service with the young people. So far, advisory offices of this nature have been established in three towns.
　　West German metalworkers, in more than 400 petitions submitted to the Metalworkers' Union Congress, which is scheduled to open in Dortmund on September 10, stated that their greatest demand is to take combative measures to oppose re-militarization and conscription.
　　The Bavarian Teachers' Association also expressed its opposition to any form of military propaganda and preliminary military training in schools in a resolution submitted to the Federal Assembly.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 8th -- According to the "Abendpost" of Frankfurt am Main, West German Federal Assembly Speaker Gerstenmaier (a member of West German Chancellor Adenauer's Christian Democratic Union) disagrees with Adenauer on some issues. He opposes Adenauer's overemphasis on militarization and advocates more consideration of the development of the international situation.
　　The newspaper pointed out that Bonn believes that Gerstenmaier's attitude is "a blow to Adenauer's stubbornly pursued arms policy."
　　Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 8th -- According to a Deutsche Presse-Agentur (DPA) report from Bonn: The West German Ministry of Defense's newspaper announced on September 6 that the West German government is preparing to recruit former Hitler SS officers to participate in the establishment of the West German Defense Forces.
