    Rubber Production and Trade in Southeast Asian Countries
    Cao Kangbo
    The main natural rubber producing region in the world is Southeast Asia, with rubber plantations accounting for 93% of the world's total rubber plantation area. In 1955, the world's total natural rubber production was 1,912,500 tons, of which Indonesia produced 733,786 tons, accounting for 38.37%; Malaya produced 639,128 tons, accounting for 33.42%; Thailand produced 132,000 tons, accounting for 6.9%; and Ceylon produced 93,830 tons, accounting for 4.91%. Adding the output from regions such as Vietnam, Cambodia, India, Burma, Sarawak, and North Borneo, Southeast Asia's natural rubber production accounted for 92% of the world's total. In 1955, the world's synthetic rubber production was 1,085,266 tons, mainly produced in the United States, accounting for about 90%. The largest consumer of rubber in the world is the United States, which consumed 634,800 tons of natural rubber in 1955, accounting for 33.99% of total consumption. The second largest is the United Kingdom, with natural rubber accounting for 13.19% of total consumption. Followed by West Germany, France, Japan, and Canada. The consumption of natural rubber in the above six countries accounted for 69.36% of total consumption.
    The natural rubber producing countries consume very little domestically, and almost all of it needs to be exported. In 1955, Malaya exported a total of 994,176 tons of rubber (including 362,300 tons of re-exports); Indonesia exported 721,786 tons; Thailand exported 130,181 tons; Ceylon exported 97,393 tons; and Vietnam and Cambodia exported 87,234 tons. The total exports from Southeast Asian countries accounted for 95% of the world's total exports.
    The production and trade of natural rubber are of great significance to the national economies of Southeast Asian countries. Taking Malaya as an example, rubber plantation area accounts for 67% of its total cultivated area, rubber output value accounts for 75% of total agricultural output value, rubber provides 40% of national income, and rubber exports account for more than 50% of its total exports (65.9% in 1950, 61.7% in 1951). More than 50% of Malaya's population depends entirely or partially on rubber for a living. The purchasing power of Malayan residents and the government's income largely rely on rubber. A decrease of one Malayan cent in rubber prices reduces the government's annual foreign exchange income by 13 million Malayan dollars (equivalent to over 4 million US dollars). In 1950 and 1951, due to panic buying by the United States, rubber prices rose, and Malaya had a surplus of over a billion Malayan dollars each year. Apart from the monopoly capitalists and some rubber plantation owners, the working people did not benefit from this. Subsequently, due to the United States' implementation of an "embargo" and price suppression policies on natural rubber, rubber prices plummeted, and Malaya went from a surplus to a deficit. In 1952, the deficit was 52,680,344 Malayan dollars, in 1953 it was 316,085,122 Malayan dollars, and in 1954 it was 153,440,000 Malayan dollars, causing countless small producers to go bankrupt and a large number of workers to become unemployed and fall into starvation. The basic situations in other countries such as Indonesia, Thailand, and Ceylon are roughly the same.
    Because the production of natural rubber is highly concentrated, and consumption is also highly concentrated, while producing countries almost need to export all their products, this allows imperialist countries, especially the United States, to control the economic lifeline of Southeast Asian countries to a large extent.
    In addition to controlling the economic lifeline of Southeast Asian countries through trade, Western countries also carry out direct plunder through investment. Most of the large rubber plantations in Southeast Asian countries are controlled by foreign capitalists. More than 75% of the area of ​​large rubber plantations in Malaya is controlled by British capitalists. Before 1942, that is, before Japan invaded Southeast Asia, the total foreign capital investment in Southeast Asian rubber plantations reached 800 million US dollars. Among them, the United Kingdom accounted for 425 million US dollars, mostly invested in Malaya, followed by Indonesia, Ceylon, and Burma; the Netherlands accounted for 267 million US dollars, all concentrated in Indonesia. France's investment was 55 million US dollars, mostly invested in Vietnam. The United States invested about 60 million US dollars. After World War II, monopoly groups in capitalist countries launched fierce struggles to control rubber production. American capital increasingly invaded the Southeast Asian region, especially Indonesia. The three major American rubber concerns—United States Rubber Company, Firestone Tire & Rubber Company, and Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company—all own huge rubber plantations in Sumatra and Java.
    Imperialism has extracted countless sweat and blood from the working people in Southeast Asian countries and seized a large amount of super profits. In 1950, the production cost of large rubber plantations was 285 US dollars per ton, but the selling price was as high as 782 US dollars, with a profit rate of 203%. This exploitation is extremely cruel.
    Natural rubber is regarded as a strategic material by imperialist countries, especially in recent years, they have used the "Cold War" to turn it into a speculative commodity. As a result, the production and trade of rubber are very abnormal, and prices are very unstable. Among all commodities, rubber prices fluctuate most frequently and the amplitude is greatest. The highest price in history was in 1910, reaching 153 pence per pound; the lowest was in 1932, falling to 1.68 pence, a difference of nearly 100 times. After World War II, the average price in 1949 was 11.78 pence. After the outbreak of the American war of aggression in Korea, the price rose sharply, reaching a maximum of 73 pence in February 1951. After that, the price continued to fall to 15.87 pence in 1954. In 1955, the United States created artificial purchasing power through deferred sales, greatly increasing automobile production, resulting in a situation where rubber supply could not meet demand, prompting prices to rise, reaching 43.5 pence in August 1955. In 1956, US automobile production sharply reduced and the production and consumption of synthetic rubber greatly expanded, causing rubber prices to fall step by step, from 35-36 pence at the beginning of the year to 21.25 pence on June 1.
    Because price changes are too frequent and fluctuations are too large, the production and sales of rubber are often in an unstable state, which has an extremely violent destructive effect on the economy of producing countries.
    From 1956, rubber prices frequently fell. The average price per pound in January was 33.35 pence; in February it was 29.74 pence; in March it was 28.15 pence; in April it was 26.35 pence; in May it was 24.11 pence; in June it was 23.80 pence (the lowest on June 1 fell to 21.25 pence). The main reasons: First, due to the substitution effect of synthetic rubber. The history of synthetic rubber development is very short. In 1937, the world's output was only 3,000 tons (excluding the Soviet Union). During the Second World War, production increased rapidly, especially in 1955, when US monopoly capital, in the case of large differences between the prices of synthetic rubber and natural rubber, greatly expanded the production of synthetic rubber in order to obtain high profits and as a weapon to suppress natural rubber prices. The output in 1955 reached 970,468 tons, an increase of 55.8% compared with 1954. The consumption ratio of synthetic rubber to natural rubber in the world has also undergone great changes. In 1954, it was 30 to 70, in 1955 it was 37 to 63, and in the first quarter of 1956 it increased to 44 to 56. In the United States, the consumption ratio of synthetic rubber to natural rubber in 1954 was 52 to 48, and in December 1955 it increased to 62 to 38. In the future, the substitution effect of synthetic rubber will be further strengthened. The United States recently announced that, based on technical reasons, 38% of rubber products are suitable for using synthetic rubber, 27% are suitable for using natural rubber, and the remaining 35% can use both, which is determined by the price ratio of the two.
    The second main reason for the decline in rubber prices in 1956 is the reduction in automobile production and the reduced demand for rubber, followed by a reduction in imports. In 1955, automobile sales in the United States reached 8 million vehicles, a large part of which was sold in advance for the needs of residents in 1956 through deferred payment methods. Due to the expansion of sales volume in 1955, difficulties in promotion this year have been caused. The reduction in US automobile production began in late December 1955. In the first half of this year, only 3.19 million automobiles were produced, a decrease of 25% compared with the same period last year, while inventories increased to 900,000 vehicles, an increase of 50% compared with the same period last year. According to the US "Financial Times" on June 4, the number of unemployed automobile workers in the United States has reached 185,000. Recently, the number of unemployed workers continues to increase. The chairmen of Ford and General Motors predicted in May this year that the sales volume of automobiles in the United States in 1956 will be less than 6 million vehicles, about 5.8 million vehicles. Due to a series of news of automobile production cuts and sales difficulties, as well as the actual reduction in demand for rubber, prices have fallen again and again.
    Due to the strengthening of the substitution effect of synthetic rubber, the sharp reduction in automobile production, and the fact that the United States' military stockpiling of rubber has reached saturation, the sales of natural rubber have been greatly affected. From January to July this year, Malaya's rubber exports were only 547,924 tons, a decrease of 5.9% compared with the same period last year, especially the reduction in exports to the United States and the United Kingdom was even more severe. The quantity shipped to the United States in the first quarter was 44,141 tons, a decrease of 6.9% compared with the same period last year; the quantity shipped in the second quarter was reduced to 35,821 tons, a decrease of 16.7% compared with the same period last year. The quantity shipped to the United Kingdom in the first quarter was 71,431 tons, and in the second quarter it was only 42,153 tons, a decrease of 41%.
    From a time perspective, rubber production is generally higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year, while automobile production is usually a peak season in the spring, but this has not been realized this year. Therefore, in the second half of the year, on the one hand, rubber production will increase, and on the other hand, automobile production will continue to decrease. From the trend, rubber prices are going to fall.
    We oppose the monopolization of rubber in Southeast Asian countries by colonialists. It is completely reasonable for Southeast Asian countries to demand free trade in rubber.
    China is currently undergoing large-scale economic construction, and industries such as automobiles, electrical appliances, chemicals, and construction are developing rapidly, so the need for rubber will definitely increase year by year in the future. Due to the continuous improvement of people's purchasing power, the amount of rubber required in the manufacturing consumer goods industry will also increase. In the past few years, due to the obstruction of the US "blockade" and "embargo" policies, normal and direct trade between China and Singapore and Malaya was once interrupted, which greatly affected rubber trade. This time, the Singapore and Malaya trade delegation came to our country to visit and explore the possibility of future trade between the two sides, which is beneficial to both sides. As long as both sides reach an agreement based on their respective needs and possibilities, and in accordance with the principle of equality and mutual benefit, the rubber trade between China and Singapore and Malaya has broad prospects.

    东南亚国家橡胶的生产和贸易
    曹康伯
    世界天然橡胶主要生产地区是东南亚国家，胶园面积占全世界橡胶园总面积的93％。1955年全世界天然胶产量共计一百九十一万二千五百吨，其中印度尼西亚生产七十三万三千七百八十六吨，占38.37％；马来亚生产六十三万九千一百二十八吨，占33.42％；泰国生产十三万二千吨，占6.9％；锡兰生产九万三千八百三十吨，占4.91％。如加上越南、柬埔寨、印度、缅甸、沙捞越、北婆罗洲等地区的产量，东南亚地区天然胶产量占全世界总产量92％。人造胶1955年全世界产量一百零八万五千二百六十六吨，主要生产国家是美国，占90％左右。世界消费橡胶最大的国家是美国，1955年消费天然胶六十三万四千八百吨，占总消费量33.99％。其次是英国，天然胶占总消费量13.19％。再其次为西德、法国、日本、加拿大。以上六个国家天然胶的消费占总消费量69.36％。
    天然胶的生产国家本国消费数量很少，几乎全部需要向国外输出。1955年马来亚共输出橡胶九十九万四千一百七十六吨（其中有三十六万二千三百吨是转口）；印度尼西亚输出七十二万一千七百八十六吨；泰国输出十三万零一百八十一吨；锡兰输出九万七千三百九十三吨；越南、柬埔寨输出八万七千二百三十四吨。整个东南亚国家出口数量占全世界出口量的95％。
    天然胶的生产同贸易对东南亚国家的国民经济有非常重大的意义。以马来亚为例，橡胶园种植面积占其国内总耕种面积的67％，橡胶产值占农业总产值75％，橡胶提供了国民收入的40％，橡胶出口总值占其全国出口总值50％以上（1950年占65.9％，1951年占61.7％）。马来亚有50％以上人口全部或部分依赖橡胶为生。马来亚居民的购买力和政府的收入很大程度上依靠橡胶，胶价下降一叻分，政府每年的外汇收入就要减少一千三百万叻元（折四百余万美元）。1950年和1951年，由于美国抢购，胶价上涨，马来亚每年出超十几亿叻元，除垄断资本和一些橡胶园主而外，劳动人民并没有从中得到什么好处。其后由于美国实施“禁运”，对天然胶采取压价政策，胶价惨跌，马来亚由出超转为入超。1952年入超五千二百六十八万零三百四十四叻元，1953年入超三亿一千六百零八万五千一百二十二叻元，1954年入超一亿五千三百四十万叻元，造成无数小生产者破产和大批工人失业和陷于饥饿的境地。其他国家如印度尼西亚、泰国、锡兰等，其基本情况亦大致相同。
    由于天然胶的生产非常集中，消费也非常集中，而生产国家几乎需将全部产品输出，这就使帝国主义国家，特别是美国，在很大程度上操纵了东南亚国家的经济命脉。
    西方国家除通过贸易控制着东南亚国家的经济命脉外，并通过投资进行直接掠夺。东南亚各国的大胶园大部分掌握在外国资本家手中。马来亚大胶园75％以上的面积掌握在英国资本家手里。1942年以前，即日本侵占东南亚以前，外国资本在东南亚胶园的投资总共达八亿美元。其中英国占四亿二千五百万美元，大部分投资在马来亚，其次是印度尼西亚、锡兰和缅甸；荷兰占二亿六千七百万美元，全部投资集中在印度尼西亚。法国的投资五千五百万美元，大部分投资在越南。美国投资约六千万美元。第二次大战后，资本主义国家垄断集团间为控制橡胶的生产，展开了尖锐斗争。美国资本越来越多地侵入了东南亚地区，特别是印度尼西亚。美国的三大橡胶康采恩—美国橡胶公司、法斯通车胎及橡胶公司、固特异车胎及橡胶公司在苏门答腊及爪哇均拥有巨大的橡胶园。
    帝国主义从东南亚国家榨取了无数劳动人民的血汗，攫取了大量超额利润。1950年大胶园生产成本每吨橡胶二百八十五美元，但售价高至七百八十二美元，利润率达203％。这种剥削是非常残酷的。
    天然胶被帝国主义国家视作战略物资，特别是近年来，更利用“冷战”把它变为一种投机商品。其结果使橡胶的生产和贸易很不正常，价格很不稳定。各种商品中，橡胶价格的变动最频繁，波动幅度最大。历史上最高价格是1910年，每磅曾达一百五十三便士；最低是1932年，跌落到一点六八便士，相差几达一百倍。第二次世界大战后，1949年平均价为十一点七八便士。美国侵略朝鲜战争爆发后，价格直线上升，1951年2月最高达七十三便士。其后价格一直下跌到1954年的十五点八七便士。1955年美国用赊售的办法创造人为的购买力，大量增加汽车生产，造成橡胶供不应求的局面，促使价格上涨，1955年8月达四十三点五便士。1956年美国汽车剧烈减产并大量扩充人造胶的生产与消费，使胶价又步步下跌，由年初的三十五—三十六便士下跌到6月1日的二十一点二五便士。
    由于价格变动太频繁，波动幅度太大，使橡胶的生产与销路经常处于不稳定状态，对生产国家的经济起着一种极为剧烈的破坏作用。
    1956年起，橡胶价格频频下跌。1月份平均价每磅为三十三点三五便士；2月份二十九点七四便士；3月份二十八点一五便士；4月份二十六点三五便士；5月份二十四点一一便士；6月份二十三点八○便士（6月1日最低曾跌到二十一点二五便士）。主要原因：第一是由于人造胶的代替作用。人造胶发展的历史很短，1937年全世界产量仅三千吨（不包括苏联）。第二次世界大战期间产量增加很快，特别是1955年，美国垄断资本在人造胶和天然胶价格悬殊的情况下，为取得高额利润并作为压低天然胶价格的武器，大量扩充人造胶的生产，1955年产量达九十七万零四百六十八吨，比1954年增加55.8％。全世界人造胶与天然胶的消费比例也发生了很大变化，1954年为三十比七十，1955年为三十七比六十三，1956年第一季度增加为四十四比五十六。美国1954年人造胶与天然胶消费比例是五十二比四十八，1955年12月增加到六十二比三十八。今后趋势，人造胶代替作用将更加强。美国最近发表，根据技术理由，橡胶制品中38％适宜于使用人造橡胶，27％适宜于使用天然橡胶，其余35％两者皆可，由两者的比价来决定。
    1956年橡胶价格下跌的第二个主要原因是汽车减产，橡胶需要量减少，随之进口减少。1955年美国轿车销售量达八百万辆，其中很大一部分是采用赊购的办法将1956年居民的需要提前售出。由于1955年销售数量的膨胀，造成今年推销上的困难。美国汽车减产从1955年12月下旬就已开始，今年上半年仅生产轿车三百十九万辆，较去年同期减少25％，而存货增为九十万辆，比去年同期增加50％。据6月4日美国“金融时报”说，美国失业的汽车工人已达十八万五千人。最近失业工人仍继续增加。福特与通用汽车厂董事长今年5月份发表预测称：美国1956年轿车销售量将在六百万辆以下，约五百八十万辆。由于一连串汽车减产和销售困难消息的刺激，以及实际上对橡胶需求的减少，遂使价格一跌再跌。
    由于人造胶代替作用的加强、汽车的剧烈减产，以及美国军事囤积的橡胶已达饱和，大大影响了天然胶的销路。今年1月到7月马来亚出口橡胶仅五十四万七千九百二十四吨，比去年同期减少5.9％，特别是对美国和英国的输出减少更厉害。第一季度输往美国数量四万四千一百四十一吨，比去年同期减少6.9％；第二季度又减为三万五千八百二十一吨，比去年同期减少16.7％。输往英国数量第一季度为七万一千四百三十一吨，第二季度仅四万二千一百五十三吨，下降达41％。
    从时间因素来看，橡胶生产一般下半年比上半年多，而汽车生产通常春季是一个旺季，可是今年并没有实现，因此下半年一面是橡胶生产增加，一面是汽车将继续减产。从趋势看，橡胶价格是要下跌的。
    我们反对殖民主义者对东南亚国家在橡胶上的垄断。东南亚国家要求橡胶自由贸易，是完全合理的。
    中国目前正进行着大规模的经济建设，汽车、电气、化学、建筑等工业均有很快的发展，对于橡胶的需要，今后肯定会逐年增加。由于人民购买力的不断提高，在制造消费品的工业上所需用的橡胶数量也会增加。几年来由于美国“封锁”“禁运”政策的阻挠，中国与新加坡、马来亚之间正常的和直接的贸易曾一度陷于中断，使橡胶贸易受到很大的影响。这次新加坡、马来亚贸易考察团到我国来访问，探讨今后双方进行贸易可能性，这对双方都是有益的事情。只要双方根据各自的需要与可能，本着平等互利的原则进行协议，中国与新加坡、马来亚的橡胶贸易是有广阔前途的。
