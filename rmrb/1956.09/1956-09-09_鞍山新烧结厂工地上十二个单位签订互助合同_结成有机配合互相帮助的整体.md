The bickering that existed on the construction site of the Anshan Metallurgical Chemical Construction General Company's new sintering plant has been replaced by a spirit of mutual assistance and close cooperation. This new atmosphere emerged after the twelve construction units working on the site signed mutual assistance contracts.

    The new sintering plant is currently the largest newly built sintering plant in China, and it is being constructed by twelve construction units with different specialties. On such a complex construction site, coupled with the vast area of the site, the large amount of work, and the strict technical requirements, these construction units are required to cooperate closely and form a construction whole. However, these construction units did not pay attention to this in the past, bickering with each other, not creating construction conditions for each other, and even delaying the entire construction period.

    In view of this situation, the Party Working Committee of the New Sintering Plant Comprehensive Construction Site launched a campaign in early August, bringing together the twelve construction units working on the site, including the First Mining Engineering Company, the Metal Installation Company, the Mechanical Installation Company, the Electrical Installation Company, and the Pipeline Company, to sign mutual assistance contracts. The contracts stipulated that each construction unit should guarantee to complete its tasks on schedule according to the comprehensive construction site's overall project completion plan; the construction units in the preceding work stage should actively create favorable construction conditions for the construction units in the following work stage; each construction unit should take the initiative to support each other, exchanging materials; and learn from each other's strengths to offset weaknesses, studying advanced experiences.

    Since the implementation of the mutual assistance contracts one month ago, the leading cadres of the construction units no longer complain to each other when they meet, but instead discuss and cooperate with each other. Some responsible persons of the First Mining Engineering Company and the Second Team of the Metal Installation Company can proactively solicit the opinions of the construction units. The Electrical Installation Company took the initiative to cooperate with fraternal construction units, installing electric lights in advance during construction to create conditions for three-shift operations for the construction units, and the units no longer had to invest in temporary lighting. The First Mining Engineering Company, which had the most serious disputes with the various units in the past, often caused dissatisfaction among many units due to its failure to complete the construction plan according to the projects (for example, in July, this company only completed seven of fifty-nine projects, affecting the failure of all units to complete their plans). Since the implementation of the mutual assistance contracts, they have taken the initiative to overcome difficulties, construct according to the projects, and created favorable construction conditions for fraternal units, receiving praise from the comprehensive construction site and fraternal construction units.

    Through mutual assistance contracts, the construction units on this construction site have formed an organically coordinated and mutually supportive whole, and the phenomenon of bickering affecting the progress of the project has been basically eliminated. In August, except for individual projects due to objective reasons such as the equipment not arriving, all plans were completed ahead of schedule or on schedule.

### 鞍山新烧结厂工地上十二个单位签订互助合同  结成有机配合互相帮助的整体

    鞍山新烧结厂工地上十二个单位签订互助合同
    结成有机配合互相帮助的整体
    本报讯　鞍山冶金化学建筑总公司的新烧结厂工地上存在着的扯皮现象，已被互相帮助、密切协作的风气所代替，这是在这个工地上施工的十二个建设单位签订了互助合同后出现的新气象。
    新烧结厂是我国目前最大的一座新建烧结厂，由十二个专业不同的建设单位施工。在这样一个错综复杂的工地上，加上施工现场面积广，工程量大，技术要求严，就要求这些建设单位互相密切配合，形成一个建设整体。但这些施工单位过去都不注意这一点，互相扯皮，互不创造施工条件，甚至拖延了整个工期。
    鉴于这种情况，新烧结厂综合工地党的工作委员会在8月上旬发动了第一矿山工程公司、金属安装公司、机械安装公司、电气安装公司、管道公司等十二个在这个工地上施工的建设单位，签订了互助合同。合同规定每个建设单位都应根据综合工地各项工程全面完成计划，互相保证按期交任务；在上道工序的建设单位要积极为下道工序的建设单位创造施工的有利条件；各建设单位要主动地互相支援，在原材料上互通有无；互相取长补短学习先进经验。
    自从互助合同执行一个月来，各施工单位的领导干部见了面不再是互相埋怨，而是相互商量和配合。第一矿山工程公司、金属安装公司第二队的一些负责人都能主动地征求各施工单位的意见。电气安装公司主动配合各兄弟施工单位，在施工中提前安装好电灯照明，给各施工单位创造了三班作业的条件，各单位也不必再投资安设临时照明了。过去和各单位扯皮最严重的第一矿山工程公司，常因不能按项目完成施工计划而引起许多单位不满（如7月份这个公司五十九项工程只完成七项，影响各单位都未完成计划）。自执行互助合同以来，他们主动克服困难，按项目施工，给兄弟单位创造了有利的施工条件，受到了综合工地和兄弟施工单位的表扬。
    这个工地上的各建设单位，通过互助合同已结成一个有机配合、互相帮助的整体，因扯皮而影响工程进程的现象已基本消除。8月份除有个别项目因设备未到等客观原因外，全部提前或按期完成了计划。
