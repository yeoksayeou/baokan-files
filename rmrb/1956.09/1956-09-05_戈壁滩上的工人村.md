    Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: As the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway construction project rapidly advances west of Yumen, workers' villages have emerged in the once sparsely populated vast Gobi Desert.
    Every evening, when the workers return from their shifts, the quiet workers' village suddenly becomes lively. Pleasant music plays from the loudspeakers, people are actively playing basketball and volleyball on the sports ground, some workers are reading books and newspapers in the library, and some employees are playing chess or cards in the construction site club.
    The workers' village is composed of rows of workshops and tent clusters. The wind and sand are very strong in the Gobi Desert, so most of the buildings here are buried underground, with only the roofs and the upper parts of the houses exposed above ground. When the workers were building the workers' village, they had no water, so they used trucks to transport it from dozens of kilometers away; even the mud used to build the houses had to be transported from afar. The workers used old bamboo poles to make volleyball net frames, and built courts in their spare time. They also built study sheds with mats woven from *Calamagrostis* grass. There were no tables in the spare-time cultural school, so they used old wooden poles to make study boards, placing them on their laps to write and take notes.

    戈壁滩上的工人村
    据新华社讯　随着兰新铁路筑路工程向玉门以西迅速推进，原来人迹罕到的大戈壁上出现了一座座的工人村。
    每当傍晚工人们下班回来，寂静的工人村里就顿时热闹起来。广播器里放送着悦耳的音乐，运动场上活跃着打篮球和排球的人们，有的工人在图书室里阅读书报，有些职工在工地俱乐部里下棋或打扑克。
    工人村是由一排排的工房和帐篷群组成的。戈壁滩上风砂很大，这里的建筑物大部分都埋在地下面，只剩屋顶和房屋的上部露出地面。工人们建设工人村的时候没有水，就用汽车到几十公里以外运来；连建筑房屋用的泥土也要从远处运来。工人们用旧竹杆做排球网架，利用工余时间修起球场。他们还用芨芨草编的席子搭成学习棚。业余文化学校里没有桌子，就用旧木杆做成学习板，放在膝盖上写字、记笔记。
