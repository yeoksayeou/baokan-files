    Let Sailors Reunite with Their Families
    I am a sailor who has worked on ships for over ten years. As far as I know, there is a "shore leave mentality" among some sailors because they stay on board for many years and cannot reunite with their families. For example, ships sailing on the Yangtze River now generally travel between Yichang and Chongqing every five to seven days. They enter the port one night and set sail the next morning, staying in port for only one night, and that is in complete darkness. In reality, after the ship enters the port, the crew must complete their work or find suitable replacements before they can go ashore; after returning home, they have to rush back to the ship before dawn. Currently, although there is a system of public holidays for crew members, in practice, the leadership often emphasizes that the tasks are too heavy and no one can replace them, so this system is not implemented.
    Allowing sailors to live a family life more regularly is an important issue that the shipping department should address, and I hope it will attract attention.

    让海员同家人团聚
    我是一个在船上工作了十多年的水手。据我所知，在一部分海员当中，存在着一种“上岸思想”。因为他们长年留在船上工作，不能同家人团聚。像航行在川江的轮船，现在一般是五天到七天在宜昌和重庆之间往返一次。头天晚上进港，第二天天明开航，在港内停航只有一个晚上，而且还是两头摸黑。实际上船进港以后，船员必须将工作做完或者找到适当人员代替工作，才能上岸；回到家里，又要忙着在天明以前返回船上。目前，虽有船员公休制度，但是实际上，领导方面常常强调任务过重、无人代理工作，不执行这个制度。
    让海员比较经常地过家庭生活，是航运部门应该解决的一个重要问题，希望能引起注意。
