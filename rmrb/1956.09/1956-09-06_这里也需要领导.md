    Leadership is Also Needed Here
    Gao Guangyuan
    Since the 100 advanced drivers nationwide proposed the "Safety, Economy, 100,000 Kilometers Without Major Overhaul Campaign," all eight driving teams under the Second Motor Transport Team of the First Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways responded enthusiastically and launched a vigorous advanced producer movement. Jiang Qingyuan, a Youth League member and driver, created a set of experiences in saving fuel during the movement and attended the National Advanced Producers Conference. During the movement, the team leaders specifically organized two working groups to go to various driving teams to help drivers promote Jiang Qingyuan's fuel-saving experience and Yin Wenjie's safe driving experience, as well as other advanced operating methods. The team's working groups also helped the lagging trucks find the reasons for their backwardness and urged them to quickly catch up with the advanced levels. Driven by the advanced producers, the eight driving teams have now transformed from wasting fuel every month and generally failing to meet fuel consumption quotas to saving fuel every month, with more than 95% of the trucks breaking through the fuel consumption quotas. In terms of completing tasks, all vehicles have generally exceeded various indicators such as daily vehicle kilometers, ton kilometers, and tonnage. This is, of course, very good.
    However, on the other hand, the vehicle attendance rate of this motor transport team has remained at a backward level. According to the needs of construction and transportation and the condition of the vehicles, the Engineering Bureau requires an attendance rate of 70%, but they have never even reached 50%. The main key to completing transportation tasks lies in improving the vehicle attendance rate, and only by improving the attendance rate can we increase production for the country. If we do not firmly grasp this main link, it will not only affect the engineering tasks, but also the other saving measures will be in vain. From an economic value perspective, the team saved a total of 5,554 kilograms of fuel in June, worth 3,810 yuan. If the existing 83 vehicles increase their attendance rate by only 10% per month, they can increase the country's wealth by more than 30,000 yuan per month. It can be seen that while saving fuel, we should also seize the main link of improving the attendance rate, so as not to lose sight of the bigger picture for the sake of small gains!
    The main reason for the low attendance rate of the Second Motor Transport Team is that repairs cannot keep up with driving. The repair tasks are not completed every month, and some vehicles have been in the factory for several months without being repaired; some vehicles have been repaired but cannot even run one-tenth of the prescribed interval mileage, and rework accidents occur frequently. The work of the team's repair shop has formed such a routine: "Busy with disassembly and inspection at the beginning of the month, idle waiting for materials in the middle of the month, and too late to rush to work at the end of the month." The team leaders know that the repair shop is a weak link in production, but they have not organized advanced producer movements in this department for a long time, nor have they helped them summarize and exchange experiences, let alone organized the promotion of advanced experiences from other units. Which group or individual is the most advanced in the entire repair shop? The leaders have no idea, and the employees are also at a loss. Everyone does their own thing, doesn't understand each other, no one can drive anyone, and no one learns from anyone.
    Analyzing the team's reward situation can also reveal that the advanced producer movement is being carried out very unevenly. In the first half of this year, the team had a total of 424 person-times awarded, of which 361 person-times were awarded to drivers and assistants, accounting for 85.14% of the total number of awards; while repair workers and managers, who account for about 44% of the team's total number of people, only received 63 person-times, accounting for only 14.86% of the total number of awards. The repair workers said: Model drivers appear one after another in our team, but we rarely hear of model repair workers.
    The problem is very clear. If the advanced producer movement can also be carried out well in the repair shop, this backward state of repairs not keeping up with driving can be changed, and the vehicle attendance rate can be improved. The reason why the repair shop has been relatively backward in the past is not because the workers' enthusiasm for work is not high, their skills are low, or there are no advanced figures and advanced experiences; in fact, there are also repair workers among them who have not had quality accidents for several years, and they also have repair work experience. The problem is that the leaders do not see this point, and subjectively believe that the weak situation of the repair department is difficult to reverse for a while; but the workers Li Fuxiang and Zhang Taifu said: Our repair shop can completely put forward a resounding slogan: eliminate rework accidents and ensure the completion of repair tasks.
    The leaders of the Second Motor Transport Team cannot focus on the aspect of saving gasoline in the advanced producer movement and abandon the leadership of improving the vehicle attendance rate. Only by quickly promoting the advanced producer movement to the employees of the auto repair department can we improve the attendance rate and adapt to the current very tight transportation situation.

    这里也需要领导
    高光垣
    自从全国一百名先进司机提出了开展“安全、节约、十万公里无大修运动”的倡议后，铁道部第一工程局第二汽车运输队所属八个行车小队一致响应这个倡议，热烈展开先进生产者运动。青年团员、司机姜庆元在运动中创造了一套节约油料的经验，出席了全国先进生产者会议。运动中，队领导上专门组织了两个工作组，分头深入到各个行车小队，具体帮助司机推广姜庆元节约油料的经验和尹文杰安全行车的经验等各种先进操作方法。队工作组还帮助落后的台车找出落后的原因，促使他们迅速赶上先进水平。在先进生产者的带动下，现在八个行车小队已经由月月浪费油料、普遍达不到油料消耗定额，转变为月月节约油料，有95％以上的台车突破了油料消耗定额。在完成任务方面，各车普遍超过了日车公里、吨公里、吨位等各项指标。这当然是很好的。
    但是，在另一方面，这个汽车队的车辆出勤率始终停留在落后的水平上。工程局根据施工运输的需要和车辆状况，要求出勤率达到70％，但是他们连50％都没有达到过。完成运输任务的主要关键在于提高车辆出勤率，只有提高出勤率才能为国家增加生产。如果不紧紧抓住这一主要环节，不仅影响工程任务，而且其它的节约措施也会落空。再从经济价值来看，这个队6月份共节省油料五千五百五十四公斤，价值三千八百一十元，如果现有的八十三辆汽车，每月出勤率仅以提高10％来计算，一个月就可以为国家增产三万多元的财富。由此可见，在节约油料的同时，更应抓紧提高出勤率这一主要环节，才不至于因小失大！
    第二汽车运输队出勤率低落的主要原因是修理赶不上行车。修理任务月月完不成，有的车进了厂几个月修不出去；有的车修出去后连规定间隔里程的十分之一也跑不到，返工事故层出不穷。队上修理所的工作已经形成这样的常规：“月初拆检忙，月中待料闲，月底赶工来不及。”队的领导上明知修理所是生产中的薄弱环节，但在这个部门中却长期没有组织开展先进生产者运动，没有帮助他们总结和交流经验，更没有组织推广外单位的先进经验。全修理所究竟哪个组、哪个人最先进？领导人心中无数，职工们也茫然不知。大家各干各的，互不了解，谁也不能带动谁，谁也没有学习谁。
    再从这个队的奖励情况来分析，也能发现先进生产者运动开展得极不平衡。这个队在今年上半年共有四百二十四人次得奖，其中司机和助手得奖的就有三百六十一人次，占总受奖次数的85.14％；而约占全队人数44％的修理工人和管理人员，受奖者却只有六十三人次，仅占总受奖次数的14.86％。修理工人说：我们队上模范司机接二连三的出现，但很少听到有模范修理工。
    问题很清楚，如果修理所也能把先进生产者运动很好地开展起来，这种修理赶不上行车的落后状态是可以改变的，车辆的出勤率是可以提高的。修理所过去之所以比较落后，并不是工人的劳动热情不高、技术低、没有先进人物和先进经验；事实上，他们之间也有几年没出质量事故的修理工，也有修理工作的经验。问题在于领导上看不到这一点，主观地认为修理部门薄弱的局面一时难以扭转；但工人李福祥、张太富说：我们修理所满可以提出一个响亮的口号：消灭返工事故，保证完成修理任务。
    第二汽车运输队的领导在先进生产者运动中不能偏重节约汽油的一面，而放弃对提高汽车出勤率的领导了。只有迅速把先进生产者运动推广到汽车修理部门的职工中去，才能提高出勤率，适应目前运输工作十分紧张的情况。
