    Today's Helan Mountain Towers
    By our reporter Liu Bang
    Leaving Yinchuan's west gate and passing through the new city, one can see the Helan Mountains in the distance. Regarding the height of the Helan Mountains, the ancients gave an evocative description: "Who mends the northwest sky? This mountain stands as a pillar!" Regarding its size, there are also roughly accurate records: "The Helan Mountains span five hundred li" and "stretch across five counties and cities from north to south." In fact, the Helan Mountains are famous because they were the birthplace of many heroic stories in history: as early as the end of the Jin Dynasty, the Xiongnu chieftain Helian Bobo proclaimed himself the Great Xia Heavenly King here; in the Northern Song Dynasty, the Qiang people's Yuan Hao also established the Western Xia Empire on this mountain; we all remember the Southern Song Dynasty's hero Yue Fei and his passionate oath - "Drive long chariots to smash through the Helan Mountain passes." But today, the Helan Mountains have entered a new era! They are receiving a group of outstanding sons and daughters of all ethnic groups who are developing treasures and building the motherland, and countless new heroic deeds will add the most glorious page to the history of this famous mountain!
    The Helan Mountains, a famous forest area, suffered devastating damage during Ma Hongkui's eighteen-year rule. After liberation, the People's Government established a forest management office here, strictly implemented mountain closure for afforestation, and widely mobilized the masses along the mountains to prevent and protect the forests. In the past five or six years, the people have created a famous fire-free forest area here. Today, the reborn Helan Mountain forest area (excluding the rear mountain), stretches for more than one hundred kilometers from Sanguankou to Weidegou, with an average width of about fifteen kilometers. The total area is one thousand five hundred square kilometers. Starting this year, the Helan Mountain forest area will move from the stage of mountain closure for afforestation to the stage of rational tending, active regeneration, barren mountain afforestation, and comprehensive acceleration of mountain greening; on this basis, the initiative in utilizing existing forests will be brought into play. In the words of the foresters: "The trees of the Helan Mountains must also participate in socialist construction!"
    Diantaizi is said to be the site of the palace of the Western Xia King Yuan Hao. Now, apart from this intriguing place name and the occasional fragment of glazed tile that can be found, there are only the white tents of the forestry workers. These workers are all well-tested young men. Although their clothes are tattered, their hair and beards are long, and their faces are dark due to the long-term life in the forest area! However, from their clear pupils, I saw a blazing flame of youth! It is with this flame of youth that they face the wind, rain, and snow, step on slippery moss, and endure cold and hunger, living in the deep mountains and valleys year after year.
    Actually, I had heard about their living conditions long ago. Take Wu Tiancai, the leader of the foresting team sitting in front of us, for example! Of his twenty-five years, he spent ten in the army. He was only transferred to the Helan Mountains last year, but now one-third of the Helan Mountains has his footprints. Don't underestimate the four-jin-heavy shoes he wears, made inside and out of car tires. He has already worn out several pairs of such shoes. Although he is a demobilized soldier, he has never put down his gun - he relies on it to deal with saboteurs who sneak into the forest area, protect the forests, and defend his comrades! Although he is still holding a gun, he has preliminarily learned a technique that other gun-wielding people have not learned - how to survey forest areas, how to nurture and regenerate them, how to collect seeds...
    On another clear day, I and several other comrades entered the exploration area of the Helan Mountain phosphate mine. Wang Youwen, the captain of the 405 Team of the Resource Exploration Department of the Gansu Provincial Department of Industry, came to receive us. "What a young captain!" One of my companions exclaimed. The twenty-three-year-old Wang Youwen replied enthusiastically and modestly: "Our cause is originally the cause of young people!" The 405 Team only came to the Helan Mountains in March this year. The oldest member of the team is not yet twenty-five years old. They are all young people who have just left school. The area they are exploring is full of ravines and dense forests. The trees range in height from four meters to eight meters. Their task is to survey and map the complex terrain of this forest area at a scale of 1:2000. Conducting measurements in a forest-covered area like this is a new subject for them. They collected a lot of information about measuring in forest areas. After looking at it, there was only one method in the books - to cut through the lines of sight. In layman's terms, this means cutting down all the trees that are in the way. After a preliminary calculation, they would have to cut down 47,000 trees of all sizes. Forty-seven thousand trees! How much blood and sweat of forestry workers would it take to nurture them! Leaving aside this, cutting down trees has at least two disadvantages for the country: first, it takes manpower and money; second, it wastes time. Is there no better way? Difficulties surrounded this group of young people. But the young people also conquered the difficulties. Finally, advanced methods of forest area measurement were created by this group of young people! One of the main items is to use a connecting sleeve to raise the five-meter-high leveling rod to nine meters. In this way, there is no need to cut trees, and the line of sight can be opened.
    The young people's sweat was not shed in vain! Facts have proved that the phosphate reserves in the Helan Mountains are very rich, and the mineral content is all above the mineable grade. The state has decided to invest in building a factory and carry out large-scale mining.
    Visiting the forests and apatite of the Helan Mountains is like only seeing the fur and skin of the Helan Mountains. The real "treasure" of this sky-supporting giant is buried hundreds of meters below, in her vast and profound belly - that is, coal, which is known as the food of industry! Today, Shizuishan on her northeast slope is attracting another group of young men and women who are exploring for "treasure".
    Shizuishan and the Ikezhao League of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are separated only by the mighty Yellow River. In the days when "broad sands were used to search for the traces of border horses," this was an important port for water transport on the Yellow River, and furs from several northwestern provinces were mostly collected and distributed here. Now, when we come here, this ancient ferry has put on a new look of large-scale construction. This small market town is undergoing rapid changes. In the past, this was a wilderness of "snow-covered mountain tops and yellow sand rolling in the wind," but now more than a dozen drilling towers are standing on the wilderness. The red flags waving in the wind at the tips of these steel giants, and the snow on the top of the Helan Mountains, reflect each other, forming a magnificent and dazzling picture. The roar of the diesel engines, which shakes the valleys and pales the mountain wind, is like bursts of spring thunder announcing the beginning of a new century for the Helan Mountains. The area of the Helan Mountain coalfield has not yet been fully ascertained, but according to the information already available, two to four pairs of mine shafts with an annual output of 900,000 to 1.2 million tons can be built here, enough to be mined for eight centuries. Listen, eight centuries, in other words, eight hundred years! Mountains of the motherland! The light and heat that you have slumbered for tens of millions of years will become an immortal torch on the road of socialist construction in the motherland, and a new industrial city will be born at your feet. Our proud mountains! Our proud era! (Attached picture)
    Every summer, the Helan Mountains are full of beautiful scenery, and nearby herdsmen drive their flocks into the mountains to begin summer grazing. The picture shows herdsmen of the Alxa League grazing their flocks in the Helan Mountains. Ule (photographer)

    今日的贺兰山阙
    本报记者　柳梆
    出银川西门，过新城，就可以远远地望见贺兰山。关于贺兰山的高，前人有过形象的描写：“西北天谁补？此山作柱擎！”关于它的大，也有了大体上正确的记载：“贺兰之山五百里”、“南北横跨五县市”。其实，贺兰山之所以有名，还由于历史上她曾经诞生过许多英雄故事：远在晋朝末年，匈奴族赫连勃勃就在这里自称大夏天王；到了北宋，羌人元昊也在这座山上建立了西夏帝国；我们都还记得南宋抗金的英雄岳飞和他那壮怀激烈的誓辞——“驾长车踏破贺兰山阙。”但是今天啊，贺兰山已经跨进了一个新的时代！她正在接待着一群开发宝藏建设祖国的各族人民的优秀儿女，无数新的英雄事迹，将要为这座名山的历史添上最辉煌的一页！
    贺兰山这个著名林区，在马鸿逵统治的十八年中，遭到毁灭性的破坏。解放后，人民政府在这里设立森林管理所，严格实行封山育林，广泛发动沿山群众起来防火护林。五、六年来，人民群众在这里创造一个著名的无火林区。今天新生的贺兰山林区面积（不包括后山），从三关口到嵬德沟，长一百多公里，平均宽约十五公里。总面积是一千五百平方公里。从今年开始，贺兰山林区就要由封山育林阶段走向合理抚育、积极更新、荒山造林，全面加速山区绿化阶段；在这个基础上发挥现有林木利用的积极性。用营林员的话来说：“贺兰山的树也要参加社会主义建设了！”
    殿台子相传是西夏国王元昊的宫阙所在地。现在除了这个耐人寻味的地名和偶然可以找到几块琉璃碎瓦以外，只有林业工作人员白色的帐篷。这些工作人员，都是经过千锤百炼的小伙子。虽说长期的林区生活使他们身上的衣服破破烂烂了，头发和胡子长了，面目也黧黑了！但是，从他们那清澈的瞳孔里，我看到一股炽热的青春的火焰！正是凭着这股青春的火，他们迎着风，淋着雨，顶着雪，踏着溜滑的藓苔，忍受着寒冷饥渴，经年累月地生活在深山巨壑里。
    本来嘛，关于他们的生活情形，我早就听说了。就拿坐在我们面前的这个营林队队长吴天才来说吧！二十五年的岁月，倒有十个寒暑是在部队里度过的。去年才转业到贺兰山，可是现在贺兰山上已经有三分之一的土地留下了他的脚印。别看他穿的是四斤重的里里外外都是用汽车轮胎做成的鞋，这样的鞋已经磨穿了好几双。虽说他是个转业的战士，可他一直就没有放下枪——要靠它来对付混进林区的破坏分子，保护森林，保卫同伴！虽说他还拿着枪，他却初步学会一门其他拿枪的人没有学到的技术——怎样调查森林面积，怎样抚育更新，怎样采集种籽……
    在另一个晴朗的日子，我和其他几位同志一道进入了贺兰山磷矿的勘查区域，甘肃省工业厅资源勘查处四○五小队王友文队长过来接待我们。“好年轻的队长呀！”同伴中有人这样失声赞叹。二十三岁的王友文热情而又含蓄地回答：“我们的事业，本来就是年轻人的事业嘛！”四○五队是今年三月份才到贺兰山来的。队员中最大的年龄还没有超过二十五岁。他们都是刚离开学校不久的青年。他们勘查的这个地区，沟壑纵横，森林稠密。树木高度从四公尺到八公尺不等。他们的任务就是要在这块地形复杂的林区，测制二千分之一的地形地质图。像这样在森林掩盖区域进行测量，对于他们来说还是一门新的课题。他们搜集了许多有关在林区进行测量的资料。看来看去，书本上的办法只有一条——砍通视巷。用外行人的话来说就是把碍事的树统统砍掉。初步算了一笔账，要砍，就得砍大小四万七千株。四万七千株！这需要多少林业工作人员的血和汗才能够灌溉出来呀！这姑且不去想它，砍树最少还有两条对国家不利的：第一，要花人工和费用；第二，要耽误时间。难道就没有更好的办法吗？困难包围了这群年轻人。年轻人也制服了困难。终于，林区测量的先进方法被这群年轻人创造出来了！其中主要的一项是用一种接尺套筒把五公尺高的水准尺提高到九公尺。这样，不必砍树，视巷可通。
    年青人的汗没有白流！事实已经证明贺兰山磷的储藏量十分丰富，矿石含量都在可采品位以上。国家已经决定投资建厂，大量开采。
    参观过贺兰山的森林和磷灰石，就好比是只看到贺兰山的毛和皮。这位擎天巨人真正的“宝”，还埋藏在几百公尺以下她那博大湛深的肚子里——那就是被人称作工业粮食的煤！今天，她的东北麓石咀山，正吸引着另一群探“宝”的青年男女。
    石咀山和内蒙古自治区的伊克昭盟，只隔一条浩荡的黄河。在那“沙阔独寻边马迹”的年代，这里曾经是黄河水运的重要码头，西北数省的皮毛多经此集散。现在，当我们来到这里的时候，这个古渡口已经披上一身大规模建设的新装。这个小小的集镇正在经历着急遽的变化。从前，这里是一片“山头堆白雪，风里卷黄沙”的旷野，如今旷野上正耸立着十几座钻塔。这些钢铁巨人尖端上迎风招展的红旗，和贺兰山头的积雪，交相映辉，构成一幅壮丽夺目的图画。那震荡着山谷、使山风为之失色的柴油机的吼声，像是阵阵春雷在宣告贺兰山新世纪的开始。贺兰山这个煤田的面积到底有多大，还没有最后摸清，但是根据已经掌握的资料，这里可以建设年产九十万吨到一百二十万吨的矿井二对到四对，足够开采八个世纪。听着，八个世纪，换一种说法就是八百年！祖国的名山啊！你的这些沉睡了千万个寒暑的光和热，就要成为祖国社会主义建设大道上一把不灭的火炬，一个新的工业城市就要在你的脚下诞生。我们骄傲的山啊！我们骄傲的时代！（附图片）
    每到夏季，贺兰山便充满了一片秀丽的风光，附近牧民便把羊群赶进山里，开始夏牧。图为阿拉善旗牧民放牧在贺兰山的羊群。　乌
