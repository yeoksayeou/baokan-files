    Two Sisters
    He Wei
    The express train from Hangzhou to Shanghai is about to leave. In this short moment of parting, a thousand words are impossible to express. The two sisters leaned gently against each other, their strikingly similar eyes shimmering with touching, moist light.
    They had been separated for at least ten, or perhaps even fifteen years. It was during the Anti-Japanese War when the whole family moved down the river, but the older sister, because of her stubborn nature, stayed alone in the mountainous area of Xishui, Hubei, settling down in a village of less than two hundred people. At that time, she was only nineteen years old. A nineteen-year-old girl, painted with so much fantasy about life, and pinning so many expectations on the future! But she chose a path that, at the time, seemed almost strange: she quietly married a primary school principal in the countryside. Soon after, she herself became a rural school teacher in the small school converted from a mountain god temple. From then on, her life was decided. Over the years, she became connected to the peasants by blood and became a member of a peasant family. Recalling many years ago, the night of their farewell at the Hankou wharf, the younger sister, who had always regarded her older sister as a mother – a four or five-year-old girl, tugging at her clothes and sobbing softly, choking and feeling bitter for a long time, is a scene that is still difficult to forget.
    This was truly an unexpected reunion! The older sister was selected as a model education worker in the local area and came to Hangzhou for recuperation during the summer vacation. This used to be her old stomping ground twenty years ago, and naturally, she had many feelings. As the hot summer was about to pass, she suddenly felt lonely while floating in the lake scenery of West Lake all day long, and she thought of her alma mater. On the day before her departure, she decided to take a walk alone near the Liuhe Pagoda, in the university town built against the mountain, to relive her memories as a student and touch a tree or a stone in her memory.
    Looking out from the window of the bus, at dusk, the Qiantang River Bridge suddenly appeared before her eyes, like a line drawn between the dissolving river and the vast sky. A train, spouting white smoke, passed on the bridge, one minute, two minutes... She calculated the length of the bridge from the time the train traveled, such a long bridge! This bridge brought her back to twenty years ago, when the river seemed to have only a few short bridge piers.
    Turning a corner, the Liuhe Pagoda, standing by the river, welcomed her with its majestic appearance. Passing under the thirteen-story pagoda and climbing up the mountain, the university town on the mountain has now been converted into a normal college. Every summer vacation, primary or middle school teachers from all over Zhejiang come to the teacher training classes here to further their studies.
    The mountain is quiet, and a stream of spring water under the bamboo forest splashes on the gravel, gurgling, bringing people to a tranquil state. This is often the moment to recall life experiences. Lost in thought, she didn't notice a young girl behind the tree looking at her, watching her for a long time. When she accidentally turned her head, she couldn't help but be slightly shocked, first confused, then stunned. Ah! Could there be such a coincidence? Is this possible? Her lips moved slightly, but she couldn't shout out. Finally, seeing those clear and dreamy eyes, seeing the gesture of tilting her head slightly, seeing that same confused expression... the two long-separated sisters, with tears in their eyes, hugged each other tightly.
    The younger sister is now nineteen years old. She seems to be slightly shorter than her older sister, and what particularly surprised the older sister was that the younger sister had also become a rural school teacher, as if these two sisters, who grew up in the city, had an inextricable bond with rural children! The younger sister said that since last year she had been the head teacher and counselor of the fourth grade at the Cen Port Second Central Primary School. This summer vacation, the school transferred her to the normal college to participate in studies. She told her older sister that there were two hundred and forty-three children in the school, and those children were really lovable...
    The older sister stared at her intently, smiling approvingly and admiringly. The older sister saw the shadow of her past in the younger sister's eyes. She felt proud.
    The two rural female teachers sat side by side on a stone bench under a tree, encouraging and comforting each other. At their feet, the Qiantang River was like a white ribbon, and the twilight stretched a hazy veil across the vast river. What poetic scenery on the river.
     "Our responsibility is really not light, sister!" The younger sister said seriously, sounding a little childish to the older sister: "Educating children is not a simple task, we must put all our energy into it! But sometimes I also have contradictions, don't laugh at me, I can't explain it either. I thought about coming to the province to take the university entrance exam, I wanted to travel somewhere, I wanted to do many, many things, I think – maybe I think too much." She sighed softly.
    They had so many thoughts, so many wishes, so many inner words to pour out. But finally, the moment of parting arrived: if they didn't leave soon, they would miss the train. In the dim twilight, lights flickered across the river. They held hands tightly on the mountain, their eyes filled with tears. Grateful for this happy reunion, they firmly believed that the next reunion would not be too far apart, that was certain.

    两姊妹
    何为
    从杭州到上海的快车一会儿就要走了。这短短的别离时刻，千言万语，无从说起。姊妹两个温柔地相互依偎着，两双极其相像的眼睛里，闪烁着动人的湿润的光辉。
    她们分别了至少有十年，或竟有十五年了。还是在抗日战争时期，当全家沿江而下，姊姊却因为倔强的性格，单身留在湖北浠水的山区，在一个不满二百人的村落里定居下来。那时她还只有十九岁，十九岁的姑娘，对人生涂上了多少幻想的色彩，对未来又寄托了多少期许啊！可是她却选择了一条在当时说来近乎奇怪的道路：默默地和农村里的一个小学校长结了婚。不久，她自己也在这山神庙改成的小学校里，当起乡村女教师来。从此决定了她的一生。年长日久，她在血缘上和农民连在一起，成为农民家庭中的一个成员了。回想许多年前，在汉口码头离别的那一夜，一直把自己姊姊当做母亲一样的妹妹——一个四五岁的小女孩，拉着衣襟低低啜泣，哽哽咽咽，辛酸了好半天的那情景，至今犹难以忘却。
    这真是一次意外的重逢！姊姊被选为当地的模范教育工作者，暑假中来到杭州休养，这里曾是她二十年前的旧游地，她自然有很多感触。盛夏快过去，终日浮泛在西湖的湖光山色中间，她忽然感到寂寞起来，想起她的母校；就在临行前那一天，她决定一个人到六和塔附近，到临山而筑的大学城里去兜一转，重温她在学生时代的记忆，摸一摸记忆中的一棵树或是一块石头。
    从公共汽车的窗口远远望出去，薄暮时分，钱塘江大桥突然呈现在眼前，在溶溶的江水和万里长空之间，如同划了一道线，一辆火车喷着白烟，在桥上过去，一分钟，二分钟……她从火车行驶的时间来计算桥的长度，好长的桥啊！这条大桥把她带到二十年前，那时候江面上好像只不过有矮矮的几个桥墩。
    转了一个弯，屹立在江边的六和塔以它巍峨的风姿迎接着她。从十三层塔下经过，拾级上山，山上的大学城如今改成了师范学院。每年暑假，浙江各地的小学或中学教师，到这里的师资班来进修。
    山中寂寂，竹林下一泓泉水溅在碎石上，潺潺地，把人带到一种恬静的境界里。这往往是回忆人生经历的时刻。她在沉思默想间，没有注意树后有一个年轻的姑娘在打量她，打量她好一会了；当她偶然侧过头去，不由微微一震，始而惶惑，继而楞住。啊！难道就有这样偶然的事么？难道这是可能的么？她微微翕动着嘴唇，可是却喊不出来。最后，看到那明澈而又带着梦幻的大眼睛，看到那微微把头一侧的姿势，看到那同样困惑的表情……两个久别重逢的姊妹，噙着泪水紧紧地抱住了。
    妹妹现在已经十九岁了。看来比姊姊稍稍矮一些，而特别使姊姊惊异的是，妹妹也当了乡村女教师，好像她们这两个从小在城市里长大的姊妹，和农村孩子结了不解之缘似的！妹妹说，从去年起她就在岑港第二中心小学担任四年级班主任兼辅导员，今年暑假，学校调她到师范学院来参加学习。她告诉姊姊，学校里有二百四十三个小朋友，那些孩子们真叫人喜欢呀……
    姊姊目不转睛地望着她，欣赏地赞许地笑着。姊姊从妹妹的眼光中看到自己过去的影子。她感到骄傲。
    两个乡村女教师就这样并肩坐在树下一条石凳上，互相勉励，互相安慰。在她们脚下，钱塘江如同一条白练，暮霭在浩瀚的江面上扯起一道朦胧的薄纱。多么诗意的江上景色啊。
     “我们的责任真不轻呀，姊姊！”妹妹严肃地说，在姊姊听来不免有些稚气：“教育孩子不是一件简单的工作，要我们把毕生的精力都放进去！可我有时也有矛盾，你别笑话我，我也说不上来。我想过要到省里来考大学，我想到什么地方去旅行，我想做许多许多事情，我想——也许我想得太多了。”她轻轻叹了口气。
    她们有多少想头，多少愿望，多少内心的话要倾诉呀。可是终于到了离别的时刻：再不走，火车就要赶不上了。暮色苍茫中，隔江灯火点点。她们在山上紧紧握着手，热泪盈眶。感谢这次幸福的重逢，她们深信下次重逢，相隔一定不会过久，这是一定的。
