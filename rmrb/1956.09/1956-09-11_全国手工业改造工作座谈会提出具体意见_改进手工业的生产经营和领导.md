Xinhua News Agency, 10th. The National Handicraft Transformation Work Symposium, which lasted for twenty-two days, concluded on September 1st. The meeting studied issues such as centralized and decentralized production after the collectivization of handicrafts, improving business management, income and labor insurance benefits for cooperative members, supply and marketing relationships, and strengthening leadership over handicrafts. Participants included directors of handicraft bureaus from various provinces and cities, directors of handicraft production federations, and representatives from relevant central departments, totaling one hundred and ten people. According to reports from various regions, as of the end of July this year, there were 100,435 handicraft cooperatives (groups) organized nationwide, with approximately 4.7 million members, basically achieving the collectivization of handicrafts. The development of the movement is generally normal, handicraft production is generally increasing, and the labor income of most cooperative members has increased compared to before joining the cooperatives. However, due to the rapid development of the upsurge in the handicrafts cooperative movement, significant changes have taken place in the internal and external relations of handicrafts during the transformation process, and many new problems have emerged.

The first issue brought up for discussion at the meeting was the issue of centralized and decentralized production after the collectivization of handicrafts. The meeting analyzed the characteristics of China's handicrafts, believing that some handicrafts could be appropriately concentrated for production, but most handicrafts are small and dispersed, with complex industries and diverse products, possessing great flexibility and the ability to adapt to market changes. It was believed that insufficient research had been done on these characteristics in the past, leading to blind establishment of large cooperatives, mergers of cooperatives, and excessive concentration of production and unified calculation of profits and losses. The result was that the variety and designs of products decreased, the needs and convenience of the people were not met, and unfavorable effects were produced on the development of production and the income of cooperative members.

The meeting required all regions to immediately classify and rank existing cooperatives (groups), affirming those that were correctly concentrated and had no problems with unified accounting; those that were not yet clear and could be adjusted or not could be left temporarily untouched, pending clarification of the situation before handling; and those that were clearly wrongly concentrated should be resolutely and systematically appropriately dispersed into small cooperatives or groups, and individual operations could also be allowed, and unified accounting that was inappropriate should be gradually implemented separately.

In order to enable all regions to correctly handle the issues of centralized and decentralized production, unified calculation of profits and losses, and separate calculation of profits and losses in handicraft cooperatives, the meeting required all regions to thoroughly educate cadres ideologically at all levels, correct one-sided ideas such as only seeking convenience in management, wanting to establish large cooperatives but not small cooperatives or groups, and make it clear to cadres that appropriately dispersing those production cooperatives that are excessively concentrated, and allowing the coexistence of large cooperatives, small cooperatives, groups, and even individual cooperative members engaged in mobile repair services, is precisely in order to better leverage the enthusiasm of handicraftsmen, adapt to the ever-changing needs of the market, increase production, improve service quality, facilitate residents, and increase the income of cooperative members. Whether large cooperatives, small cooperatives, groups, or even individual cooperative members who join cooperatives should all be regarded as socialist in nature.

When dealing with the excessive concentration and inappropriate unified accounting of certain handicraft cooperatives, all regions should distinguish between the importance and urgency of the matter, adhere to the principle of active and steady progress, conduct full discussions among cooperative members, formulate specific plans, and implement them after approval by the local Party committee and government.

Developing production, meeting social needs, and increasing the income of cooperative members are the hallmarks of running handicraft cooperatives well. The main problem of handicrafts at present is that production cannot keep up with the needs of consumption, and the quantity, quality, and variety of products in many cases cannot meet the growing demands of the vast consumers. The meeting called on handicraft cooperatives in all regions to widely carry out advanced producer movements, actively improve technology, rationally adjust labor organization, establish necessary and feasible production management systems, practice strict economy, oppose waste, so as to ensure and continuously improve service quality, and produce products with greater quantity, better quality, and more varieties. The meeting reflected that after the upsurge of handicraft cooperation, the income of a small number of handicraftsmen decreased to varying degrees compared with before the transformation, and the medical treatment problems of many handicraftsmen themselves have not yet been resolved. Based on this situation, the meeting focused on analyzing the various reasons for the reduction of cooperative members' income, and pointed out that increasing the income of cooperative members must be based on the development of production and implement the principle of "distribution according to work, more pay for more work." At the same time, resolutely correct various unfavorable factors and measures affecting the income of production cooperative members, and strive to achieve that the labor income of 90% of cooperative members increases compared to before joining the cooperatives, and those few cooperatives that still have difficulties should also strive to increase the income of 70% of their members. The wages of handicraftsmen should be appropriately adjusted within this year.

How to solve the labor insurance and welfare of handicraftsmen? The meeting believes that all regions can, according to the specific conditions of the handicraft cooperatives, extract 5% to 10% of the additional wages based on the total wages as the general medical expenses for cooperative members, subsidies for sick leave and maternity leave, and subsidies for cooperative members' families with serious financial difficulties. A portion of this can be extracted and handed over to the trade union or the higher-level federation to organize medical pooling.

The meeting also made preliminary studies on several issues related to supply, production, and marketing, and is now consulting with relevant central departments. Regarding the supply of raw materials, which is the most urgent need of handicrafts at present, the meeting hopes that relevant departments in all regions should assist in solving it as quickly as possible.

How to strengthen leadership over handicrafts in the future? The meeting believes that the situation of handicrafts is complex, with great local characteristics, and is an integral part of local industry, closely related to industry, agriculture, commerce, and other aspects. In order to facilitate timely resolution of problems in accordance with local conditions, effectively manage handicrafts well, and develop local industry more, faster, better, and more economically on the basis of handicrafts, further leverage the role of handicrafts in the national economy, and meet social needs, the production and transformation of handicrafts, in accordance with the central government's previous instructions, must be the responsibility of the local Party committees and governments to uniformly plan and strengthen leadership.

During the meeting, a preliminary study was also conducted on many specific issues that occurred in handicrafts after cooperation, and corresponding measures were discussed based on these issues. However, because these issues are important in nature and complex in relationships, further in-depth research is still needed after the meeting before suggestions can be made to the Central Committee and the State Council.

    全国手工业改造工作座谈会提出具体意见
    改进手工业的生产经营和领导
    新华社10日讯　历时二十二天的全国手工业改造工作座谈会，已经在9月1日结束。这次会议研究了手工业合作化以后的集中生产和分散生产、改善经营管理、社员的收入和劳保福利、供销关系以及加强对手工业的领导等问题。参加会议的有各省市手工业管理局长、手工业生产联社主任、中央有关部门的代表等一百一十人。根据各地汇报，到今年7月底止，全国组织起来的手工业合作社（组）有十万零四千三百五十三个，社（组）员约四百七十万人，基本上实现了手工业合作化。运动的发展大体上是正常的，手工业生产一般也是上升的，大部分社员的劳动收入比入社前有所增加。但由于手工业合作化运动的高潮发展得很迅速，在改造过程中，手工业的内部和外部关系已有很大变化，出现了不少新的问题。
    首先提到会议议程上来研究的，是关于手工业合作化以后的集中生产和分散生产问题，会议分析了我国手工业的特点，认为有一部分手工业是可以适当集中生产的，但大多数手工业是小而分散，行业复杂，产品多种多样，有很大的灵活性，能适应市场变化的需要，认为过去对这些特点研究不够，曾发生盲目办大社，并大社，过多地集中生产和统一计算盈亏的现象。其结果是：产品的品种、花色减少，人民的需要和便利得不到满足，对发展生产和社员收入也产生了不利的影响。
    会议要求各地立即对现有社（组）进行分类排队，把集中对了的和统一核算没有问题的肯定下来；目前还看不清楚，可调整可不调整的，暂时不动，等弄清情况再作处理；已经明显可以看出肯定集中错了的，应该坚决有计划地适当分散为小社或小组，个别的也可单独经营，统一核算不适当的，应该逐步实行分别核算。
    为了使各地正确处理手工业合作社的集中生产和分散生产，统一计算盈亏和分别计算盈亏问题，会议要求各地要层层弄通干部思想，纠正只图管理方便、愿办大社不愿办小社或小组等片面思想，使干部明确对那些集中过大的生产合作社适当进行分散，使大社、小社、小组以及某些流动修理服务的个体户共同存在，正是为了更好地发挥手工业者的积极性，适应市场千变万化的需要，提高生产，提高服务质量，便利居民和增加社员收入。不论大社、小社、小组以至加入合作社的个体活动社员都应该看做是社会主义的性质。
    各地在处理某些手工业合作社的过分集中和不适当的统一核算的时候，要分别轻重缓急，掌握积极稳步的方针，经过社员充分讨论，作出具体规划，经过当地党委、政府批准后执行。
    发展生产，适应社会需要，增加社员收入，是办好手工业合作社的标志。当前手工业的主要问题，是生产赶不上消费的需要，产品的数量、质量和品种花色有许多还不能适应广大消费者日益增长的要求。会议号召各地手工业合作社广泛开展先进生产者运动，积极提高技术，合理调整劳动组织，建立必要与可行的生产管理制度，厉行节约，反对浪费，以保证和不断提高服务质量，生产数量更多、质量更好、品种更多样的产品。会议反映，手工业合作化的高潮以后，有少数手工业者的收入较改造前有不同程度的降低，不少手工业者本人的疾病医疗问题，也还没有得到解决。会议根据这一情况，着重分析了造成社员收入减少的种种原因，并指出，增加社员的收入，必须建立在发展生产的基础上，贯彻“按劳取酬、多劳多得”的原则。同时，坚决纠正影响生产社社员收入的各种不利的因素和措施，争取达到90％的社员的劳动收入比入社前有所增加，少数目前还有困难的合作社，也要争取70％的社员增加收入。手工业者的工资在今年内要作适当的调整。
    手工业者的劳保福利如何解决？会议认为：各地可以根据手工业合作社的具体条件，按工资总额提取5％到10％的附加工资，作为社员本人的一般疾病医疗费用、病假和产假的补助工资以及社员家庭生活严重困难的补助费。其中可提取一部分交工会或上级联社举办医疗统筹。
    有关供产销的若干问题，会议也作了初步研究，现在与中央有关部门协商中。手工业当前最迫切需要的原料供应，会议希望各地有关部门应尽可能地迅速协助解决。
    今后如何加强对手工业的领导？会议认为手工业情况复杂，带有很大的地方性，是地方工业的组成部分，同工业、农业、商业等方面的关系密切。为了便于因地制宜地及时解决问题，切实把手工业管好，在手工业的基础上又多、又快、又好、又省地发展地方工业，进一步发挥手工业在国民经济中的作用，适应社会需要，手工业的生产和改造工作，按照中央历次指示，必须由地方党委、政府负责统一规划与加强领导。
    会议中还对手工业在合作化后发生的许多具体问题，进行了初步研究，并根据这些问题讨论了相应的若干措施。但因为这些问题性质重要，关系复杂，还须在会后继续深入研究，才能向中央和国务院提出建议。
