Things Worthy of Deep Thought by Japanese Politicians

The United States has exerted powerful pressure on Japan regarding the Soviet-Japanese negotiations. The overbearing and blatant nature of this pressure has reached a degree rarely seen in the history of modern diplomacy.

On August 28th, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles openly stated at a press conference that if Japan recognizes the Kuril Islands as Soviet territory when signing a peace treaty with the Soviet Union, the United States would permanently occupy the Ryukyu Islands, including the military base on Okinawa. As Japanese public opinion has indignantly pointed out, Dulles's words demonstrate that the United States is attempting to pressure Japan to undermine Soviet-Japanese negotiations and obstruct the normalization of relations between Japan and the Soviet Union. At the same time, this also proves the United States' ambition to invade and occupy the Ryukyu Islands.

The indignation expressed by Japanese public opinion is quite natural. No independent country can tolerate such crude interference in its affairs, such blatant intimidation and threats against it. However, why the United States dares to adopt such an unreasonable attitude towards Japan, a country that once was, and wants to continue to be, an important country in Asia, is something that Japanese politicians should deeply consider.

Soviet-Japanese negotiations have been going on for a long time, and the only thing currently hindering an agreement is Japan's territorial demands on the Soviet Union. The issue of territorial claims should not be involved in the restoration of normal relations between Japan and the Soviet Union in the first place. Japan's raising this issue is clearly due to the encouragement and support of the United States. Some people in the United States have been "warning" Japan to be careful not to be "tricked" in the Soviet-Japanese negotiations. And some people in Japan still say that the United States is "helping" Japan. However, Dulles's remarks should serve as a sobering agent, making Japan see clearly who is tricking it.

It is no exaggeration to say that Japan has been tricked by the United States. What has Japan gained by listening to the United States and raising the territorial issue in the Soviet-Japanese negotiations? Nothing but a stalemate in the negotiations. The United States, on the other hand, has achieved its goal of obstructing the normalization of relations between Japan and the Soviet Union and Japan and China, keeping Japan in the pitiful position of an "orphan of Asia," so that the United States can direct and manipulate it more easily. Japan consults the United States on everything in the Soviet-Japanese negotiations, watching the United States's face. Japanese diplomats and politicians travel to Washington and before Dulles time and time again to request "understanding" and solicit "opinions," completely unlike a independent country conducting diplomacy. The more humble and subservient Japan is, the more the United States looks down on Japan and disregards Japan's dignity. This time, just as Prime Minister Hatoyama was preparing to go to Moscow for negotiations in person at the request of Japanese public opinion, Dulles put on the face of a "master" and raised a big stick over the head of the Japanese Prime Minister in an overbearing manner.

Eleven years have passed since the end of World War II. Major changes have taken place in the world, especially in the East. Many previously unknown and subjugated countries have now embarked on the road of independence and are playing an active role and influence in the Asian-African family of nations. Countries like Cambodia and Laos, although they are small countries, and although they are not comparable to Japan in terms of population and economic development, have gained respect in all aspects because they pursue an independent foreign policy and refuse others to interfere in their internal affairs, and their international status is rising day by day. Even the United States does not dare to openly exert pressure on them in a crude way. Japan, as an important country in Asia, is instead being bullied and reprimanded by the United States at any time and place, and cannot raise its head in front of the United States. How long can the Japanese people with self-respect tolerate this situation? How long can Japanese politicians with self-respect tolerate this position of humility?

Japanese politicians should now seriously review the development of the international situation and the Asian situation, and determine the correct path that Japan should take in this situation. In the face of such crude interference as Dulles's, the time has come for Japanese politicians to pursue an independent policy that puts the interests of the Japanese nation first.

### 值得日本政治家深思的事情

    值得日本政治家深思的事情
    美国在苏日谈判问题上对日本施加了强大的压力，这种压力的蛮横和露骨，达到了近代外交史上极其少见的程度。
    8月28日，美国国务卿杜勒斯在记者招待会上公然表示，如果日本同苏联签订和约的时候承认千岛群岛是苏联的领土，美国就要永久占有包括冲绳岛军事基地在内的琉球群岛。正如日本舆论愤慨地指出的，杜勒斯的话表明，美国企图对日本施加压力，来破坏日苏谈判，阻挠日本同苏联关系的正常化。同时这也证明了美国侵占琉球群岛的野心。
    日本舆论所表示的愤慨情绪，是十分自然的。没有一个独立的国家能够容忍外国这样粗暴地干涉它的事务，这样露骨地对它进行恫吓和威胁。但是，为什么美国竟敢对曾经是、并且也想继续是亚洲的一个重要国家的日本采取这样无理的态度，这有着值得日本政治家们深思的地方。
    日苏谈判已经进行很久了，现在唯一妨碍谈判达成协议的东西，就是日本提出的对于苏联的领土要求。在恢复日苏正常关系的问题上本来就牵扯不到什么领土问题。日本提出这个问题，显然是受了美国的怂恿和支持。美国某些人一直在“警告”日本，叫日本当心在苏日谈判中不要“上当”。而日本的某些人甚至直到现在还说美国是在“帮助”日本。但是，杜勒斯的谈话应该可以起清醒剂的作用，使日本看清楚使它上当的究竟是谁。
    说日本上了美国的当，是一点也不夸大的。日本在苏日谈判中听从美国的话，提出领土问题，得到了什么呢？除了造成谈判的僵局以外什么也没有得到。而美国却因此而达到了阻挠日苏、日中关系正常化的目的，使日本保持“亚洲的孤儿”这种可怜的地位，以便于美国指使操纵。日本在苏日谈判中事事请示美国，看美国的脸色。日本的外交官和政治家一趟又一趟地跑到华盛顿和杜勒斯跟前去请求“谅解”，去征求“意见”，完全不像一个独立国家办外交的样子。日本越是这样卑躬屈节，美国就越是瞧不起日本，不把日本的尊严当一回事。这一次，正当鸠山首相在日本舆论要求下准备亲自到莫斯科去谈判的时候，杜勒斯就摆出了“主子”的面孔，专横地在日本首相头上举起了大棒。
    第二次世界大战结束已经十一年了。在世界上，特别是在东方，已经发生了重大的变化。从前许多没没无闻、受人宰割的国家，现在都走上了独立的道路，在亚非国家大家庭里发挥它们积极的影响和作用。像柬埔寨、老挝这些国家，虽然它们是小国，虽然它们无论在人口、经济发展等方面都比不上日本，但是由于它们执行独立的外交政策，拒绝他人干涉自己的内政，它们却得到了各方面的尊重，它们的国际地位正在日益提高，甚至美国也不敢粗暴地对它们公开施加压力。而作为亚洲重要国家的日本，却反而随时随地受到美国的欺侮和呵责，在美国面前抬不起头来。有自尊心的日本人民能对这种情形忍受到什么时候？有自尊心的日本政治家们能对这种低声下气的地位忍受到什么时候？
    日本的政治家们现在应该认真检讨一下国际局势和亚洲形势的发展，确定日本在这个形势中应该走的正确道路。在杜勒斯这样的粗暴干涉面前，日本政治家奉行把日本民族利益放在第一位的独立政策的时候，应该已经到了。
