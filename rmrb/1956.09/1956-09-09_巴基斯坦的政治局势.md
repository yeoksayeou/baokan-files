    The Political Situation in Pakistan
    Cui Qi

    In recent months, the political situation in Pakistan has often been unstable. The governments of East Pakistan Province and West Pakistan Province, which constitute the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, have successively experienced crises. At present, new changes are also brewing in the central government of Pakistan.

    Originally, East Pakistan Province had been ruled by the United Front since 1954. However, the United Front split last year, and the East Pakistan People's League and the Democratic Party withdrew from the United Front due to dissatisfaction with the policies implemented by the United Front, becoming opposition parties. Since then, the strength of the United Front has been weakening day by day, and it has lost its majority position in the provincial legislative assembly.

    In July of this year, the United Front provincial government's Chief Minister Sarkar ordered two ministers to resign, which triggered the withdrawal of twenty-nine members of parliament from the United Front, resulting in a new major blow to the United Front. After this, the United Front only occupied about 100 seats out of the 300-plus seats in the provincial legislative assembly. On the other hand, the opposition People's League and Democratic Party began to establish a political advantage, demanding the formation of a new provincial government. Although the United Front repeatedly used the method of prolonging the recess of the provincial legislative assembly to prevent the opposition from proposing a vote of no confidence in the government, when the legislative assembly resumed on August 13, two-thirds of the members still passed a resolution demanding the government's resignation. On August 31, the United Front was finally forced to step down. Now, the East Pakistan Provincial Government, headed by Ataur Rahman, leader of the East Pakistan People's League, has announced its inauguration.

    In West Pakistan, the vast majority of seats in the provincial legislative assembly were originally controlled by the Muslim League. However, Sahib Khan, who took office as Chief Minister of the West Pakistan Provincial Government in October last year, was a non-partisan figure. In April of this year, some Muslim League members insisted that Sahib Khan resign. Sahib Khan refused to resign and founded a new party - the Republican Party. As a large number of Muslim League members withdrew from the Muslim League and joined the Republican Party, the Republican Party's strength has rapidly increased, occupying nearly 200 of the 300-plus seats in the provincial legislative assembly. The Muslim League's plan to maintain its dominant position in West Pakistan and gain power was declared a failure.

    The failures of the United Front in East Pakistan and the Muslim League in West Pakistan cannot but affect the stability of the central government, because the Pakistani government, headed by Muhammad Ali, which was established in August 1955, was precisely a joint formation of these two political parties.

    In order to resolve the government crisis, on August 27, Prime Minister Muhammad Ali convened a joint party meeting of the Muslim League and the United Front. Forty-one members of the National Assembly who attended the meeting voted in favor of the proposal put forward by Republican Party leader Sahib Khan, expressing their confidence in Prime Minister Ali. However, eleven important members of the Muslim League led by Prime Minister Ali himself (including two ministers) refused to attend the meeting because they did not agree with Prime Minister Ali's invitation to Republican Party members to attend the meeting. According to the Pakistan News Agency, in this situation, Prime Minister Ali will lead a new government jointly supported by the East Pakistan United Front and the West Pakistan Republican Party.

    However, it is not difficult to see that such a new government is still unstable. First of all, the Muslim League, led by Prime Minister Ali himself, refuses to give support and occupies the position of the opposition party. Secondly, the United Front, which supports the Ali government, has already stepped down in East Pakistan, and the People's League and the Democratic Party, which are currently in power in East Pakistan Province, have not yet joined the central government. As for the eighty seats in the National Assembly, only forty-six support the Ali's new government, and this weak majority determines that the new government will encounter many difficulties.

    From the entire process of changes in the Pakistani political situation, we can see some of the most prominent facts: on the one hand, the strength of the Muslim League, which has been in power for the longest time, and the United Front, which follows the policies of the Muslim League, has been greatly weakened; on the other hand, the strength of the East Pakistan People's League, which withdrew from the United Front, and the Republican Party, which split from the Muslim League, is expanding day by day.

    The Muslim League was originally the ruling party when Pakistan was founded and had a great influence in both East and West Pakistan. However, in the 1954 East Pakistan legislative assembly elections, its seats were reduced from 223 to 10. In June 1955, in the Pakistan Constituent Assembly elections, the Muslim League suffered another defeat, gaining only 32 seats out of 80. Therefore, the Muslim League had to end its one-party rule and formed a coalition government of the Muslim League and the United Front in August 1955. After the Republican Party was established in April of this year, the Muslim League's strength in West Pakistan was greatly weakened. Now, in the National Assembly, the Muslim League's seats have been reduced from 32 to 12.

    The United Front was originally a political party alliance established on the eve of the 1954 East Pakistan elections. At that time, it put forward a progressive twenty-one-point program. However, the United Front abandoned this program after coming to power, and since then its prestige has been greatly reduced.

    The failures of the Muslim League and the United Front are by no means accidental phenomena in Pakistan's political life. Since the Muslim League came to power, it has been following the United States' policy of expanding armaments and preparing for war, and has participated in the Southeast Asia Group and the Baghdad Pact, resulting in Pakistan being in a very isolated and unfavorable position in diplomacy, and at the same time, the domestic economic situation has deteriorated further. After the establishment of the coalition government of the Muslim League and the United Front, although some positive measures were taken, its internal and external policies have not changed, so it has increasingly been met with dissatisfaction and opposition from the broad masses of the Pakistani people.

    In contrast to the Muslim League and the United Front, the East Pakistan People's League has always adhered to a democratic and progressive program, advocating the release of political prisoners and the solution of food shortages and other issues. In terms of diplomacy, it believes that Pakistan should not become a puppet of any foreign country or any group, but should implement a policy of non-alignment to ensure that Pakistan obtains its due position in the international family. These propositions reflect the wishes of the broad masses of the Pakistani people, so the influence of the People's League is expanding day by day.

    As for the Republican Party, although it has not yet announced its political platform, its leaders have also made promises about reforming the land system, holding general elections as soon as possible, and releasing political prisoners. At the same time, the Republican Party itself was built on the ruins of the increasingly disintegrating Muslim League, and many Muslim League members who felt that the Muslim League had no way out turned to the Republican Party, which is an important factor in the Republican Party's rapid expansion. Now, people are paying attention to what kind of political platform the Republican Party will announce and whether it will fulfill its promises.

    Based on the above facts, the long-term turmoil and changes in the Pakistani political situation are superficially caused by internal contradictions within the ruling party and the struggle between the ruling party and the opposition party, but in essence, they reflect the Pakistani people's dissatisfaction with Pakistan's current internal and external policies, and reflect that the influence of the people's strength on Pakistan's political life is growing.

    巴基斯坦的政治局势
    崔奇
    近几个月来，巴基斯坦的政治局势经常处于不稳定状态。组成巴基斯坦伊斯兰共和国的东巴基斯坦省和西巴基斯坦省的政府相继发生危机。目前，巴基斯坦中央政府也在酝酿新的变动。
    本来，从1954年以后，东巴基斯坦省就由联合阵线执政。但是去年联合阵线发生分裂，东巴基斯坦人民联盟和民主党由于不满联合阵线所执行的政策，退出了联合阵线，而成为反对党。从此联合阵线的势力日益削弱，并已失去省立法会议中的多数地位。
    今年7月，由于联合阵线省政府首席部长萨卡尔命令两个部长辞职，又引起了二十九个议员退出联合阵线的事件，从而使联合阵线遭到新的重大打击。在这以后联合阵线在省立法会议的三百多个席位中只占一百个席位左右了。另一方面，反对党人民联盟和民主党则开始树立了政治优势，它们要求组织新的省政府。虽然联合阵线一再利用使省立法会议长期休会的办法，阻止反对党对政府提出不信任案，但在8月13日立法会议复会时，还是有三分之二议员通过了决议，要求政府辞职。8月31日，联合阵线终于被迫下台。现在，以东巴基斯坦人民联盟领袖阿陶尔·拉赫曼为首的东巴基斯坦省政府已经宣布就职。
    在西巴基斯坦，省立法会议的绝大多数议席本来是由穆斯林联盟所控制的。但去年10月就任的西巴基斯坦省政府首席部长萨希布汗却是无党派人士。今年4月，一部分穆斯林联盟盟员坚持要求萨希布汗辞职。萨希布汗拒绝辞职，并且创立了一个新党——共和党。由于大批的穆斯林联盟盟员退出穆斯林联盟而加入了共和党，已使共和党的势力迅速增大，它在省立法会议的三百多个议席中占了近二百个议席。穆斯林联盟想要维持它在西巴基斯坦的优势地位和取得政权的计划，宣告失败。
    联合阵线在东巴基斯坦和穆斯林联盟在西巴基斯坦的失败，不能不影响到中央政府的稳定，因为在1955年8月成立的以穆罕默德·阿里为首的巴基斯坦政府，恰恰就是由这两个政党联合组成的。
    为了解决政府危机，8月27日，穆罕默德·阿里总理召开了穆斯林联盟和联合阵线联合党会议。出席会议的四十一名国民议会议员投票赞成共和党领袖萨希布汗提出的建议，对阿里总理表示信任。但是，阿里总理自己所领导的穆斯林联盟的十一个重要盟员（包括两个部长）却拒绝出席会议，因为他们不同意阿里总理邀请共和党党员参加这次会议。据巴基斯坦通讯社报道，在这种情况下，阿里总理将领导由东巴基斯坦联合阵线和西巴基斯坦共和党联合支持的新政府。
    但是，不难看出，这样的新政府仍然是不稳定的。首先，阿里总理自己领导的穆斯林联盟拒绝给予支持，而居于反对党地位。其次，支持阿里政府的联合阵线已经在东巴基斯坦下台，而目前在东巴基斯坦省执政的人民联盟和民主党还没有参加中央政府。至于在国民议会的八十个议席中，支持阿里新政府的只有四十六席，这个微弱的多数决定了新政府要遇到重重困难。
    从巴基斯坦政局变化的整个过程中，我们可以看到一些最突出的事实：一方面，执政最久的穆斯林联盟和追随穆斯林联盟政策的联合阵线的势力，大为削弱；另一方面，退出联合阵线的东巴基斯坦人民联盟和从穆斯林联盟中分裂出来的共和党的势力，则日益扩大。
    穆斯林联盟原是巴基斯坦立国时的执政党，在东巴基斯坦和西巴基斯坦都有很大影响。但在1954年东巴基斯坦立法议会选举中，它的议席就从二百二十三席减为十席。1955年6月，在巴基斯坦制宪议会选举中，穆斯林联盟又遭到失败，在八十个议席中只得到三十二席。因此，穆斯林联盟不得不结束它的一党执政，而于1955年8月成立了穆斯林联盟和联合阵线的联合政府。今年4月共和党成立后，穆斯林联盟在西巴基斯坦的势力又大为削弱。现在，在国民议会中，穆斯林联盟的议席已从三十二席减为十二席了。
    联合阵线原是1954年东巴基斯坦选举前夕成立的一个政党联盟。当时它曾提出一个进步的二十一点纲领。但是联合阵线上台以后背弃了这个纲领，从此它的威信大大降低。
    穆斯林联盟和联合阵线的失败，决不是巴基斯坦政治生活中的偶然现象。自从穆斯林联盟执政以来，它一直追随美国的扩军备战政策，并参加了东南亚集团和巴格达条约，结果使巴基斯坦在外交上处于十分孤立和不利的地位，同时国内的经济情况也更加恶化了。穆斯林联盟和联合阵线的联合政府成立以后，虽然采取了某些积极措施，但它的内外政策仍然没有改变，因此日益遭到巴基斯坦广大人民的不满和反对。
    同穆斯林联盟和联合阵线相反，东巴基斯坦人民联盟一直坚持民主进步的纲领，主张释放政治犯和解决粮荒等问题。在外交方面，它认为：巴基斯坦不应该成为任何一个外国或任何集团的傀儡，而应该执行一种不参加集团的政策，以保证巴基斯坦在国际大家庭中获得应有的地位。这些主张反映了巴基斯坦广大人民的愿望，因此人民联盟的影响日益扩大。
    至于共和党，虽然它至今还没有宣布它的政纲，但是，它的领袖们也曾经发表过关于改革土地制度、早日举行大选和释放政治犯等等诺言。同时，共和党本身就是在穆斯林联盟日趋瓦解的废墟上建立起来的，许多感到穆斯林联盟没有出路的穆斯林联盟盟员都转到共和党方面来，这是共和党迅速扩大的一个重要因素。现在，人们注意的是，共和党究竟要宣布什么样的政纲，并且是否实现它的诺言。
    根据以上事实来看，巴基斯坦政局的长期动荡和变化，表面上是由于执政党内部矛盾和执政党与反对党的斗争而造成的，但是实质上却反映了巴基斯坦人民对巴基斯坦现行的内外政策的不满，并且反映了人民的力量对巴基斯坦政治生活的影响正在增长。
