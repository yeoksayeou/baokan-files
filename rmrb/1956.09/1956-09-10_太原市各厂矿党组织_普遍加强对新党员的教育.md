Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, September 9th: The Party organizations in factories and mines in Taiyuan City, in response to the urgent desire of a large number of activists emerging from the advanced producer movement to join the Party and to meet the needs of the vast number of new Party members, have universally carried out educational work on Party knowledge. Up to now, more than 10,000 new Party members in the city have completed their studies of the "Party Constitution Textbook" and "On the Cultivation of a Communist Party Member" in spare-time Party schools. Currently, more than 17,000 activists who are seeking to join the Party are also studying the "Eight Conditions for Party Member Standards."

The Party organizations in various factories and mines have carried out various Party class education activities, with the responsible cadres of the Party committee insisting on giving two Party lectures every month to educate new Party members and activists seeking to join the Party on Party knowledge. Twenty-one spare-time Party schools have been established in larger factories and enterprises throughout the city, and smaller units have also consistently maintained a Party class system. The Party organizations of sixteen factories and mines, including Taiyuan Mining Machinery Plant and Shanxi Machine Factory, held Party member training classes during the summer vacation of the workers' spare-time cultural schools, enabling 1,500 new Party members to systematically study the "Party Constitution Textbook." Some activists seeking to join the Party in Jinsheng Textile Factory have even voluntarily organized Party class study groups. In addition, the Party organizations in various factories and mines have also treated senior intellectuals who are seeking to join the Party with enthusiasm, adopting methods such as introducing books and exchanging learning experiences to cultivate and educate them. Currently, 150 senior intellectuals, such as engineers and doctors, are studying under the guidance of the Party organizations in their respective units.

Systematic Party class study has powerfully improved the political consciousness of new Party members and the vast number of activists.

    太原市各厂矿党组织
    普遍加强对新党员的教育
    据新华社太原9日电　中共太原市各厂矿组织，根据先进生产者运动中涌现出的大批积极分子迫切要求入党和广大新党员的需要，普遍开展了有关党的知识的教育工作。截至目前为止，全市已有一万多名新党员在业余党校中学完了
  “党章教材”和“论共产党员的修养”。目前要求入党的一万七千余名积极分子也正在学习“党员标准八项条件”。
    各厂矿党组织开展各种党课教育活动，并由党委负责干部每月坚持讲两次党课，对新党员和要求入党的积极分子进行有关党的知识的教育。全市较大的厂矿和企业共开办了二十一座业余党校，较小的单位也经常坚持了党课制度。太原矿山机器厂、山西机器厂等十六个厂矿的党组织，在职工业余文化学校暑假期间举办了党员训练班，使一千五百名新党员系统地学完了“党章教材”。晋生纺织厂有些要求入党的积极分子，还自愿组织了党课学习小组。此外，各厂矿党组织对要求入党的高级知识分子，也热情相待，采取了介绍书籍和交流学习心得等方式进行培养教育，现在，已有一百五十名工程师、医生等高级知识分子正在他们所在单位的党组织指导下进行学习。
    系统的党课学习，有力地提高了新党员和广大积极分子的政治觉悟。
