    Commentary on New Developments in the Suez Canal Issue
    Gu Si

    In the past month or so, many important changes have taken place in the international situation. The struggle surrounding the Suez Canal issue continues to develop. Japanese Prime Minister Hatoyama has decided to visit the Soviet Union to restore negotiations that have stalled due to Japan's insistence on unreasonable territorial demands. The two major parties in the United States have held their national conventions, and the election has entered a tense stage. While peace and democracy have become the mainstream of current international situation development, a counter-current of anti-peace and anti-democracy has emerged in West Germany. The Adenauer government has announced the banning of the German Communist Party, attempting to suppress the developing peace and democratic forces in West Germany and clear the way for West Germany's re-militarization.

    However, the struggle over the Suez Canal issue remains the central issue in the current international situation. It has become the focal point of the struggle between colonialist and anti-colonialist forces worldwide.

    From the London Conference to the "Five-Nation Committee"

    From August 16 to 23, a conference was held in London to discuss the Suez Canal issue. The United States, Britain, and France decided to convene the London Conference with the aim of coercing Egypt into surrender.

    However, the development of the situation, from the beginning, did not go as the colonialists had subjectively planned. The main party concerned, Egypt, refused to participate. The Soviet Union, India, Indonesia, and other countries insisted on the principle of respecting Egyptian sovereignty and opposed the pre-determined approach of the United States, Britain, and France at the London Conference, which only allowed discussion of "international control." Most of the other invited countries also expressed that the conference should be devoted to seeking peaceful solutions. Under these circumstances, Britain had to announce that participation in the London Conference did not imply any obligation, while also expressing a willingness to seek a peaceful solution. Only then could the conference begin.

    A sharp struggle between colonialism and anti-colonialism unfolded at the conference. As a result of the intense diplomatic activities of the United States, Britain, and France, they barely obtained lukewarm support from a dozen countries (mostly within the Western military bloc) for the "Dulles Plan." On the other hand, the just position adhered to by the Soviet Union, India, and other countries received widespread support from public opinion around the world. The conference finally violated the colonialists' intentions and recognized that Egyptian sovereignty should be respected and that the canal issue should be resolved by peaceful means. At the same time, Western colonial countries were forced to accept the approach of negotiating with Egypt, rather than forcing Egypt to accept the decision of the majority of the conference as they had originally planned.

    The Egyptian people's firm attitude in safeguarding their sovereignty, the close unity of the Arab countries on this issue, the strong support of socialist countries and other independent countries like India for Egypt's just position, and the widespread demand for a peaceful solution in public opinion in various countries, left the colonialists surrounded on all sides, forcing them to retreat from their original positions. The London Conference ended in this situation with the shameful bankruptcy of Western colonialist conspiracies.

    However, Western colonial countries were not resigned to defeat after the London Conference. They sent Australian Prime Minister Menzies, who supported the colonialist position, to lead the "Five-Nation Committee" to Cairo, armed with the mandate of the "majority" of the London Conference, to have the Egyptian government accept the "Dulles Plan" for international control of the Suez Canal. The colonialists simultaneously adopted various methods, from intensifying military deployments to inducing foreign technicians of the Suez Canal Company to resign, in order to support the activities of the "Five-Nation Committee." Echoing these activities of Britain and France, Eisenhower personally came forward to support the mission of the "Five-Nation Committee."

    Egypt's Solemn Position

    Egypt saw through the colonialists' tricks. It agreed to meet with the "Five-Nation Committee" but refused to conduct any negotiations based on the "Dulles Plan," because such negotiations would mean interference in Egypt's internal affairs, because international control of the Suez Canal is fundamentally incompatible with the principle of safeguarding Egyptian sovereignty.

    In order to promote a peaceful resolution of the issue, Egypt sent notes to various governments, suggesting the establishment of a negotiating body that could adequately represent the different views of the countries using the canal to negotiate a solution to the issue of freedom of navigation on the basis of recognizing Egyptian sovereignty. It also guaranteed: freedom of navigation through the canal, development and improvement of waterways, and assurance of technical efficiency, as well as reasonable passage fees. Egypt's attitude of upholding sovereignty and arguing reasonably shattered the propaganda offensive of the colonialists coordinating with the negotiating activities of the "Five-Nation Committee," and refuted the various excuses used by the colonialists to mask their military threats against Egypt.

    At the same time, Egypt also took contingency measures without slackening, actively preparing the technical forces necessary to maintain canal navigation and making military arrangements to protect the sovereignty of the canal zone and deal with aggression. These actions by Egypt received the full support of the Arab countries, leaving the colonialists with no gaps to exploit. During the Cairo talks, public opinion and even officials in many countries generally expressed opposition to the "Five-Nation Committee's" approach of submitting an ultimatum in Cairo and strongly demanded adherence to the method of peaceful consultation to seek a solution to the dispute. Within Britain and France, the voices opposing the government's continued dangerous policy of playing with fire were also exceptionally loud. In this situation, the "Five-Nation Committee," headed by Menzies, had no choice but to sadly fly back to London empty-handed from Cairo on September 10, filled with the pain of failure. The effort of Western colonial countries to coerce Egypt into surrendering its sovereignty once again ended in failure.

    A New Rogue Plan

    The Western colonial countries, which are already completely bankrupt morally, still have no intention of abandoning their policies of blackmail and coercion. On the contrary, they are adopting an even more barbaric and rogue attitude in an attempt to salvage their failure. After tense consultations, the United States, Britain, and France announced their decision to establish a so-called "Suez Canal Users' Association." According to the three-nation plan, this "Association" will hire its own pilots, take responsibility for canal traffic, and collect passage fees from ships passing through the canal. This is an act of blatant contempt for Egyptian sovereignty. And this plan even stipulates that Egypt is responsible for maintaining the canal, and if it refuses this "cooperation," it will be a violation of the 1888 convention, in which case the signatories to this convention can take any action they deem appropriate, which is beautifully termed "protecting rights." Following the orders of the former Suez Canal Company, hundreds of foreign technicians in the canal area resigned en masse on the 14th. At the same time, Western colonial countries concentrated a particularly large number of ships at the mouth of the canal to demand piloting, attempting to create obstacles to canal navigation.

    This rogue plan is to force Egypt to accept the principles of the "Dulles Plan," and at the same time bring together as many countries as possible, so that when Egypt continues to refuse to give up its sovereignty, it can be used as a "basis of international public opinion" for armed aggression. The morally powerless British and French colonialists are now eager to provoke Egypt to take some kind of radical action, so as to turn the aroused mass sentiment against them against Egypt.

    British Labour Party leader Gaitskell also pointed out: This is "an action with great provocation." This step by the United States, Britain, and France has created a rather emergency situation in the Suez Canal region.

    However, this plan did not improve the position of Western countries in the slightest; it only more thoroughly exposed their colonialist robber nature and sinister intentions. Indian Prime Minister Nehru stated bluntly that the three-nation plan was a step "deliberately intended to create great difficulties for the peaceful path." In recent years, there have been few other things internationally that have been met with such widespread and vehement criticism in international public opinion as this plan. Even many of the countries that supported the Dulles Plan at the original London Conference have expressed opposition to the danger of armed intervention contained in this "Users' Association" plan.

    The eighteen-nation conference held in London to discuss this plan was a sign of another failure for the colonialists. Dulles originally wanted to use this conference to show the so-called "unity of the users," but the meeting only showed division and confusion. Although the United States, Britain, and France have been forced to lower their tones, other countries have either "expressed doubt" or "lack of enthusiasm." Pakistan has already rejected the plan, while Sweden and Denmark have reserved their decisions. Japan, Iran, Turkey, Ethiopia, and other countries are still "waiting for clarification." After several meetings and the expenditure of a great deal of effort from the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and France, they still had to "put away their original blueprints" and hand over many divergent proposals to a committee to sort out in order to adjust opinions.

    The Role Played by the United States

    Throughout the Suez Canal incident, the United States is increasingly revealing itself as the main role in the Western colonialist camp. The US involvement in the dispute between Britain, France and Egypt, had ulterior motives from the start. The sharp contradictions between the US, Britain and France, especially between the US and Britain in the Middle East, are no secret. Because the United States has been aggressively seizing the interests of the British Empire in that region in recent years, the British bourgeois newspapers recently openly attacked "dollar imperialism." This time, the dispute between Britain, France and Egypt, was seen by US monopoly capital as a great opportunity to get involved in the strategic Suez Canal area, which had always been under British control.

    As the most greedy colonialist country, the United States naturally does not want to see Egypt regain its sovereignty over the canal and cancel the colonialist forces' control over this important canal. Therefore, it strongly supports the colonialist positions of Britain and France, and participates in forcing Egypt to give up its sovereignty.

    However, US monopoly capital has no direct interests in the Suez Canal Company, while many of its oil fields and bases are distributed in Arab countries, which are extremely vulnerable to destruction in an anti-imperialist war in the Middle East. In addition, the US Republican Party is campaigning this year with the slogan of "peace," so it does not intend to take too much risk for the actions of Britain and France. Due to these considerations, it is not in a hurry to show its hand.

    Britain and France originally wanted to rely on US cooperation to subdue Egypt. But the United States cunningly took advantage of the weaknesses of Britain and France, gradually seized the initiative in Western negotiations, and guided the situation in the direction it wanted. During the London Conference, Dulles was the central figure in the activities of the Western countries. The "international control" plan proposed by the West was his plan. This plan is equivalent to Britain and France acknowledging that the United States has the main say in the Suez Canal Company issue. Then, the "Five-Nation Committee" that was dispatched, although headed by Menzies, was truly led by the US representative Henderson.

    After the failure of the "Five-Nation Committee," Britain and France held an emergency meeting in London to discuss the next steps. The first meeting lasted for several hours without results. Finally, it was "at the direction of the US government" (French Foreign Minister Pineau) that the "Canal Users' Association" plan was proposed. On September 13, when Dulles emphasized at a press conference that if other countries did not participate, the United States was prepared to act alone with Britain and France, it revealed that the United States was the main planner of the "Users' Association" plan. When the eighteen-nation London conference opened, Dulles again took on the role of explainer and recommender of the plan. This conference showed that the United States had taken Britain and France by the nose. However, the British and French government authorities still emphasized again and again as if they had been saved that their actions now had "the full support of the United States." There was even a French spokesman who found "exciting" support from Dulles's "complexion" when he spoke at the meeting. The declining old-fashioned colonialists of Britain and France are really sad enough.

    Washington's Double-Dealing

    The United States has its own wishful thinking, which is to direct Britain and France to charge into battle, while it strategizes behind the scenes, so that it can both reap the benefits of colonialism and avoid the guilt of colonialism and inciting war. Therefore, it adopts a set of double-dealing methods, actively supporting the colonialist positions taken by Britain and France under the banner of maintaining the international use of the canal, while shamelessly pretending to be a mediator and even a well-intentioned protector of Egyptian interests.

    But anyone who thinks that the United States is a true friend of Britain and France or an impartial mediator in the canal incident is falling for Dulles's double-dealing tactics. Behind these double-dealing tactics are extremely sinister intentions. When Dulles made a statement on the so-called "Canal Users' Association" plan, the United States' own colonialist tail was revealed. On the one hand, he emphasized support for this provocative plan, inciting Britain and France to make the situation in the Suez area very tense, until an armed conflict with Egypt occurs, so that it can both suppress the anti-colonialist movements in the Middle East and Africa, and weaken Britain and France, while the United States can reap the benefits. On the other hand, he said that the United States itself does not intend to force its way through the canal, but is prepared to have ships detour around the Cape of Good Hope, and will consider giving dollar loans to Western European countries that need help as a result. The United States expects that if the "Canal Users' Association" plan cannot force Egypt to yield, it can at least cause the canal to be blocked, creating difficulties for Egypt. At the same time, in that situation, the Western countries that will suffer will still be Britain and France, because, as the British "Economist" magazine pointed out, "they can neither find ships to carry large amounts of oil around the Cape of Good Hope, nor maintain the normal state of their economies and prevent them from being damaged in the event of a large reduction in oil supplies." They will have to rely on US aid to obtain oil supplies and transportation conditions, which will require them to pay large amounts of dollars. United Press keenly pointed out that in this situation, "the British treasury will be penniless within a few months." Now Dulles is promising to give them loans. He understands that for Western European countries, which are already very short of dollars, this will mean new dollar nooses, and for Wall Street bosses, this will be huge freight income and oil profits, and it can make Western European countries, which have just begun to show some independence due to some economic recovery in recent years, once again become submissive. Immediately after this plan was announced, there was news that more than a dozen US oil companies had formed a "Middle East Emergency Committee" to supply Western Europe with US oil. In Britain, more sober public opinion, when commenting on the news of Dulles's promise of loans, pointed out this fact: Britain's current debt to the United States will not be paid off until the end of the 20th century. It is these debts that have been a whip waved by Washington over London since the war.

    Facts have once again proved that the US monopoly capitalist group, which fears nothing more than world peace, is the greatest enemy of the peaceful and national independence interests of the people of all countries. It is obvious that without the encouragement and support of the United States, Britain and France would not dare to flaunt their power and act so barbarously and unreasonably as they do now. However, for the British and French government authorities, who are fascinated by colonialism, this practice of Wu Sangui borrowing troops is really foolish.

    The Road of Armed Intervention is Impassable

    Due to open encouragement and support from the United States, the possibility of open armed intervention by Britain and France has increased. However, for Britain and France, the difficulties are still many and are constantly increasing.

    Some relatively sober British comments have frequently sounded alarm bells, emphasizing that this will be a war with huge losses and endless harm for the West. The Egyptian people will completely destroy the last remnants of colonialist interests in Egypt, and the vested oil interests of the colonialists in the Middle East will also be destroyed, and such a war will ultimately not achieve its intended purpose.

    The dangerous provocative actions taken by the British and French governments against Egypt have also deepened the domestic financial and political crises. Eden had to ask the House of Commons for confidence to consolidate his position. Although the Labour Party's impeachment motion was not passed, the most serious split since the war has formed between the government and the opposition on important foreign policy issues. The people of Britain and France have begun to express their strong dissatisfaction with the policies adopted by the government through mass rallies and demonstrations.

    Internationally, the colonialists are already in a very difficult situation. If they dare to launch a military adventure, they will fall into an even more isolated position and be strongly resisted by the vast people of the world.

    The Soviet government has issued a statement pointing out that in the era of the vigorous development of the Eastern peoples and nuclear weapons, armed intervention is impossible. This is a timely warning to the colonialists who are still indulging in threats of force.

    Our government has given a reply to Egypt expressing that the Chinese people firmly oppose armed intervention and fully support the just struggle of the Egyptian people.

    This situation makes it impossible for the British and French governments not to weigh the situation before taking adventurous actions. Therefore, as long as the Egyptian people remain firm and united and do not give the colonialists any excuses, and at the same time make all necessary precautions, it is entirely possible to prevent the colonialists from igniting the flames of war and force them to take the path of peaceful resolution.

    It is precisely because of the strong momentum of the world's people against armed intervention that the colonialists have had to change their tone. Now, there is an attempt to use the banner of the United Nations to mask the colonialists' moral bankruptcy, while seeking some so-called "compromise" plan that still essentially requires Egypt to hand over the sovereignty of the canal in order to deceive Egypt. But the Egyptian people have a long history of fighting colonialism, have had many experiences of being deceived, and now they cherish their national sovereignty very much. They are no longer easily fooled by the colonialists' tricks. President Nasser pointed out in his telegram to the annual meeting of the Arab Student Association in the United States: "We are no longer deceived by imperialist tactics."

    The Egyptian People are Determined to Safeguard Their Territorial Integrity

    After the United States, Britain, and France announced their new provocative plans, Egypt reiterated its determination to safeguard its sovereignty. President Nasser declared on the 15th on behalf of the Egyptian people: "We intend to defend our sovereignty at all costs." This is not just empty talk. Egypt has taken decisive steps to deal with the provocations of Western colonial countries. On the 13th, Egypt issued a new mobilization order. Egyptian pilots have effectively taken on the piloting work of the entire canal. The number of ships piloted in the first batch broke the historical record of the canal. In terms of economy, various preparations have also been made, including expanding trade relations with Asian countries and socialist countries, and opening up foreign markets and sources of goods that do not use pound settlement. The economic sanctions and provocations of Western colonial countries have created some difficulties for Egypt, but Egypt has dealt with these difficulties brilliantly, and its position has not been weakened but strengthened. With the broad support of the people of all countries, the Egyptian people, who have already stood up, have sufficient strength to defeat the new provocations of Western colonial countries.

    述评苏伊士运河问题的新发展
    顾思
    最近一个多月中间，国际局势发生了许多重要的变化。围绕着苏伊士运河问题的斗争，正在继续发展。日本鸠山首相已经决定访苏，以恢复由于日方坚持无理的领土要求而陷于僵局的谈判。美国两党分别举行了全国代表大会，竞选已经进入紧张的阶段。当和平民主已成为目前国际局势发展的主流的时候，在西德出现了一股反和平、反民主的逆流。阿登纳政府宣布取缔德国共产党，企图借此镇压正在发展的西德和平民主势力，为西德的重新军国主义化扫清道路。
    可是，关于苏伊士运河问题的斗争，仍是当前国际形势中的中心问题，它已成为全世界殖民主义势力和反殖民主义势力的斗争的焦点。
    从伦敦会议到“五国委员会”
    从8月16日到23日，在伦敦召开了讨论苏伊士运河问题的会议。美英法三国决定召开伦敦会议，目的是想借此要挟埃及投降。
    可是局势的发展从开始就不像殖民主义者主观盘算的那样如意。主要当事国埃及拒绝参加。苏联、印度、印度尼西亚等国坚持尊重埃及主权的原则，反对美英法事先规定伦敦会议只讨论“国际管制”的作法。其他被邀请国家，也大多表示会议应该致力于寻求和平解决的途径。在这种情况下，英国不得不宣布参加伦敦会议并不意味承担义务，同时表示愿意求得和平解决，这样会议才算开了起来。
    会上展开了殖民主义和反殖民主义两条路线的尖锐斗争。美英法进行了紧张的外交活动的结果，才勉强取得了十几个国家（大部分是西方军事集团里的）对“杜勒斯计划”半心半意的支持。另一方面，苏印等国所坚持维护的正义立场，得到了世界各国舆论的广泛支持。会议终于违反殖民主义者的心意，承认应当尊重埃及主权和以和平方法解决运河问题争端。同时，西方殖民主义国家被迫接受同埃及进行谈判的方式，而不是像它们原来策划那样强使埃及接受会议多数的决定。
    埃及人民在维护主权方面所表现的坚定态度，阿拉伯国家在这个问题上的紧密团结，社会主义国家和印度等其他独立国家对埃及正义立场的有力支持，各国舆论普遍要求和平解决，使得殖民主义者陷于四面楚歌之中，不得不从原先的阵地退却。伦敦会议就在这种形势下以西方殖民主义阴谋的可耻破产而结束。
    但是，西方殖民主义国家并没有因为伦敦会议的失败而死心。它们派支持殖民主义立场的澳大利亚总理孟席斯率领“五国委员会”，带着伦敦会议“多数”的令箭，到开罗去要埃及政府接受“杜勒斯计划”的国际管制苏伊士运河方案。殖民主义者同时采取了各种办法，从加紧军事部署到诱逼苏伊士运河公司外籍技术人员离职，来支持“五国委员会”的活动。和英法这些活动相呼应，艾森豪威尔亲自出面，支持“五国委员会”的使命。
    埃及的严正立场
    埃及看透了殖民主义者鬼花样。它同意接见“五国委员会”，但不同意进行任何以“杜勒斯计划”为基础的谈判，因为这样的谈判就意味着干涉埃及的内政，因为国际管制苏伊士运河，是同维护埃及主权的原则根本不相容的。
    为了促进问题的和平解决，埃及照会各国政府，建议成立一个足以代表使用运河各国的不同意见的谈判机构，在承认埃及主权的基础上，协商解决航行自由问题。它还保证：运河自由通航，发展和改进航道和保证技术效率，规定合理的通行费用。埃及的这种坚持主权、据理而争的态度，击破了殖民主义者配合“五国委员会”谈判活动的宣传攻势，驳倒了殖民主义者用来掩饰他们对埃及进行武力威胁的各种借口。
    同时，埃及也毫不松懈地采取了应变措施，积极准备为保持运河航行所必需的技术力量，并作了保护运河区主权、应付侵略的军事安排。埃及的这些行动得到了阿拉伯各国的全力支持，使得殖民主义者无隙可乘。开罗会谈期间，许多国家的舆论以至官方人士，都普遍表示反对派“五国委员会”到开罗去的那种提交最后通牒的方式，强烈要求坚持以和平协商的办法来求得争端的解决。在英法国内，反对政府继续采取危险的玩火政策的呼声也异常响亮。在这种情况下，以孟席斯为首的“五国委员会”，不得不怀着失败的悲哀，在9月10日垂头丧气地从开罗空手飞回伦敦。西方殖民主义国家胁迫埃及交出主权的努力又一次归于失败。
    一个新的流氓计划
    道义上已经完全破产的西方殖民国家，仍没有打算抛弃讹诈和胁迫政策。相反，它们采取甚至更为横蛮、更为无赖的态度，力图挽回它们的失败。在经过了紧张的磋商之后，美英法三国宣布决定成立一个所谓“运河使用国协会”。按照三国计划，这个“协会”将自行招聘领航员，负起运河交通的责任，并向通过运河的船只征收通行费。这是公然蔑视埃及的主权的行为。而这个计划居然还规定埃及要负责保养运河，如果它拒绝这种“合作”，就是破坏1888年公约，那末这个公约的签字国就可以采取任何它们认为适当的行动，美其名为“维护权利”。遵照前苏伊士运河公司的命令，运河地区几百名外籍技术人员在14日全体辞职。同时，西方殖民国家却集中特别多的船只到运河口要求领航，企图造成运河通航的障碍。
    这个流氓计划是要逼迫埃及接受“杜勒斯计划”的原则，同时纠集尽可能多的国家在一起，以便在埃及继续拒绝放弃主权的时候，作为进行武装侵略的“国际舆论”根据。在道义上完全无力的英法殖民主义者，现在急于想挑起埃及采取某种激烈的行动，以便把反对他们的激昂的群众情绪转过去反对埃及。
    英国工党领袖盖次克尔也指出：这是“一个具有很大挑衅性的行动”。美英法三国的这一步骤，在苏伊士运河地区造成了相当紧急的局势。
    但是，这个计划一点也没有改善西方国家的地位，它只是更彻底地暴露了它们的殖民主义强盗本色和罪恶意图。印度总理尼赫鲁直捷了当地指出，三国计划是“有意要给和平途径造成极大的困难”的步骤。近年来，国际上很少有其他事情，像这个计划立即遭到国际舆论这样广泛和猛烈的抨击。连原来伦敦会议上支持杜勒斯计划的好多国家，也纷纷表示反对这个“使用国协会”计划所包含的武装干涉的危险。
    为讨论这个计划而在伦敦举行的十八国会议，是殖民主义者又一次失败的标志。杜勒斯原意要通过这个会议来显示所谓“使用国的团结”，结果会上只是表现了分歧和混乱。尽管美英法已被迫放低了调子，其他国家还是或则“表示怀疑”，或则“缺乏热情”。巴基斯坦已经拒绝了这个计划，瑞典、丹麦保留了决定。日本、伊朗、土耳其、埃塞俄比亚等国还“等待澄清”。会议开了几次，美英法三国外长费尽了口舌，仍不得不“收起它们原来的蓝图”，把许多分歧的主张交给一个委员会去整理，以便来调整意见。
    美国扮演的角色
    在整个苏伊士运河事件中，美国正日益显露出是西方殖民主义阵营中的主要角色。美国插手到英法和埃及的争执中来，从开始就有其不可告人的目的。美英法特别是美英在中东地区的尖锐矛盾并不是秘密。由于近年来美国在那个地区穷凶极恶地侵夺英帝国的利益，英国资产阶级的报纸不久前还公开地攻击过“美元帝国主义”。这一次英法和埃及发生争执，美国垄断资本看作是一个大好机会，来插足过去一直在英国控制下的苏伊士运河战略地区。
    作为一个最贪婪的殖民主义国家，美国自然不愿意看到埃及恢复它对运河的主权，取消殖民主义势力对这重要运河的控制。所以它大力支持英法的殖民主义立场，参与逼迫埃及放弃主权。
    但是，美国垄断资本在苏伊士运河公司中没有直接的利益，而在阿拉伯国家中却分布着它的许多油田和基地，这些设施在一次中东地区的反帝国主义战争中极易被摧毁。加上美国共和党今年正在以“和平”的口号进行竞选，因此它并不打算为英法的行动冒太大的风险。由于这些考虑，它又并不急于摊牌。
    英法原来是想依靠美国的合作来压服埃及。但是美国却狡猾地利用英法的弱点，把西方谈判的主动权逐步抢到自己手中，引导事态向着它所希望的方向发展。在伦敦会议期间，杜勒斯是西方国家方面活动的中心人物。西方提出的“国际管制”计划就是他的计划。这个计划等于是英法承认美国在苏伊士运河公司问题上有主要的发言权。接着派出的“五国委员会”，虽然以孟席斯为首，但在其中真正起领导作用的却是美国代表汉德逊。
    “五国委员会”失败以后，英法在伦敦举行紧急会谈，商量下一步行动，第一次会议开了好几个小时而没有得到结果，最后还是经“美国政府授意”（法外长比诺语），才提出了“运河使用国协会”计划。9月13日，杜勒斯在记者招待会上强调，如果其他国家不参加，美国准备同英法单独干的时候，就暴露出美国是“使用国协会”计划的主要策划人。十八国伦敦会议开幕，又是杜勒斯担当了这个计划的解释人和推荐人。这次会议表明，美国已经牵住了英法的鼻子。可是，英法政府当局还像得救似地一再强调它们的行动现在得到“美国的完全支持”哩。甚至竟有法国的一个发言人，从杜勒斯在会上发言时的“脸色”找到了“令人兴奋的”支持。没落的英法老牌殖民主义者也真够悲哀的了。
    华盛顿的两面三刀
    美国是有它自己的如意算盘的，就是指使英法去冲阵，自己却运筹帷幄，以便既能收殖民主义之利，又不必背殖民主义和煽动战争的罪名。所以它采取了一套两面三刀的办法，一方面在维护运河的国际使用这个招牌下，积极支持英法所采取的殖民主义立场，另一方面却无耻地装成是和事老甚至是埃及利益的好心肠的袒护人。
    可是谁要是以为美国是英法真正的朋友或者是运河事件公正的调解人，他就是上了杜勒斯的两面手法的大当。在这种两面手法后面，是隐藏着极其阴险的意图的。当杜勒斯就所谓“运河使用国协会”计划发表谈话时，美国自己的殖民主义尾巴就露出来了。他一方面着重支持这个挑衅计划，怂恿英法把苏伊士地区的局势搞得非常紧张，直到同埃及发生武装冲突，这样既可以镇压中东和非洲的反殖民主义运动，又可以使英法受到削弱，而美国就能坐收渔翁之利。另一方面他又说美国自己不打算强行通过运河，而准备使船只绕道好望角，并将考虑给予因此而需要帮助的西欧国家以美元贷款。美国预计到，如果“运河使用国协会”计划还不能逼迫埃及屈服，它至少可以使运河发生阻塞，为埃及造成困难。同时，在那种情况下，西方国家方面吃亏的将仍然是英法，因为，正如英国“经济学家”杂志所指出的，“它们既不能找到船只绕过好望角载运大量的石油，又不能在石油供应大大减少的情况下保持它们经济的正常状态而使其不受到损害。”它们将必须依靠美国的援助来取得石油供应和运输条件，这需要它们付出大量美元。合众社敏锐地指出，在这种情况下，“英国的国库在几个月内就将一文莫名。”现在杜勒斯答应给它们贷款。他懂得，对于本来已经非常缺乏美元的西欧国家来说，这将意味着新的美元套索，而对于华尔街老板们说来，这将是巨大的运费收入和石油利润，并且可以使得近年来刚刚因为经济有些恢复而开始闹些独立性的西欧国家，重新俯首贴耳。在这个计划宣布以后，立即就有消息说，美国十几家石油公司已经成立起一个“中东紧急委员会”，准备供给西欧以美国石油。在英国，比较冷静的舆论在评论杜勒斯答应贷款的消息时，指出了这个事实：英国目前对美国背的债已经要到二十世纪末才能还清。正是这些债权，战后一直是华盛顿在伦敦头上挥舞的一根鞭子。
    事实又一次证明，唯恐天下不乱的美国垄断资本集团，是各国人民和平和民族独立利益的最大的敌人。显而易见，如果没有美国的鼓励和支持，英法就不敢像目前这样耀武扬威，横蛮无理。可是，对于被殖民主义迷住了心窍的英法政府当局说来，这种吴三桂借兵的作法，实在是愚不可及的。
    武装干涉的路走不通
    由于得到美国公开的鼓励和支持，英法进行公开武装干涉的可能性增大了。但是，对于英法来说，困难还是很多，而且正在不断增加。
    英国一些比较冷静的言论已频敲警钟，着重指出这对西方来说将是一次损失巨大和遗害无穷的战争。埃及人民将彻底摧毁殖民主义者在埃及的最后一点残余的利益，而殖民主义者在中东的石油既得利益也将遭到毁灭，而这样一场战争最后仍然达不到预定的目的。
    英法政府对埃及采取危险的挑衅行动，也加深了国内的财政和政治危机。艾登不得不要求下院信任，来巩固他的地位。虽然工党的弹劾案没有得到通过，但是政府和反对党之间在重要的外交政策问题上，已经形成了战后最严重的分裂。英法两国的人民，已开始以群众大会和游行示威来表示他们对政府所采取的政策的强烈不满。
    在国际上，殖民主义者现在的处境已经十分困难，如果它们胆敢发动军事冒险，就将陷于更加孤立的地位，遭到世界广大人民的强烈反击。
    苏联政府已经发表了声明，指出在东方人民蓬勃发展和有核子武器的时代，武装干涉是不行的。这对于仍然沉缅于武力威胁的殖民主义者是一个适时的警告。
    我国政府已经给埃及复照表示中国人民坚决反对武装干涉，并全力支持埃及人民的正义斗争。
    这种形势使得英法政府在采取冒险行动之前都不能不有所权衡。所以只要埃及人民保持坚定和团结，并且不给予殖民主义者以任何借口，同时作好一切必要的防范，完全有可能制止殖民主义者点燃战火，迫使他们走和平解决的道路。
    正是由于全世界人民反对武装干涉的强大声势，殖民主义者不得不改变口气。现在，有着一种企图，想借联合国的旗帜来掩饰殖民主义者道义上的破产，同时正在寻求某种实质上仍然是要埃及交出运河主权的所谓“折衷”方案，来使埃及受骗。但是埃及人民有同殖民主义进行斗争的长久历史，有过不少受骗的经验，现在他们万分珍惜自己民族的主权，他们已不再容易上殖民主义的圈套了。纳赛尔总统在他给在美国的阿拉伯学生会年会的电报中就指出：“我们不再受帝国主义手段的欺骗了。”
    埃及人民决心维护主权完整
    在美英法宣布了它们新的挑衅计划之后，埃及重申了它维护主权的决心，纳赛尔总统在15日代表埃及人民宣布：“我们打算不惜任何代价来保卫我们的主权。”这不是一句空话。埃及已经采取了坚决步骤来应付西方殖民国家的挑衅。13日埃及颁发了新的动员令。埃及自己的领航员已经有效地承担起全运河的领航工作，第一批引领船只的数目就打破了运河历史上的记录。在经济方面，也作了各种准备，包括扩大同亚洲国家和社会主义国家的贸易关系，开辟不用英镑结账的国外市场和货源。西方殖民国家的经济制裁和挑衅，为埃及造成了一些困难，但是埃及已经出色地应付了这些困难，它的地位不是削弱了而是加强了。在各国人民广泛的支持下，已经站起来了的埃及人民，有充分的力量击败西方殖民国家的新挑衅。
