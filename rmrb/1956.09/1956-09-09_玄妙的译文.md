From the Readers

    Mysterious Translation

    The translation of the article "In Memory of A. A. Fadeyev," published in the fifteenth issue of Wenyi Bao (Literary Gazette), is extremely mysterious. When I read sentences like "...the point is that it was precisely we and Seryozha who entered the invincible ideological world of the Bolsheviks, and it was precisely with his eyes that we followed the author as he gradually revealed to himself all the beauty of this world...", I couldn't help but wonder: does the language of our motherland really have such a peculiar structure? This translation not only has a special sentence structure, but also vocabulary that is astonishingly strange. Terms like "strong talent" etc. that no one has ever seen are found everywhere in this translation!

    Readers do not need this kind of mysterious translation that is crudely produced by translators. This kind of mysterious translation not only damages the meaning of the original work, making it impossible to understand, but also damages the beautiful language of the motherland.
                                                                                                Dai Zhixian

    玄妙的译文
    文艺报第十五期上发表的“纪念阿·阿·法捷耶夫”这篇文章，译文非常玄妙。当我读到“……事情还在于恰恰是我们和塞略日一起进入了布尔什维克所向无敌的思想的世界，还在于恰恰是以他的眼睛我们跟随着作者逐渐给自己揭开了这个世界的全部美丽……”等句子的时候，我不禁怀疑起来：我们祖国的语言，竟有如此奇特的结构吗？这篇译文不但句子结构特殊，词汇也古怪得惊人，什么“强烈的天才”等等谁也没见过的用语，在这篇译文中却随处可以见到！
    读者是不需要译者粗制滥造出的这种玄妙的译文的。这种玄妙的译文，不但损害了原著的意思，使人无法读懂，也损害了祖国优美的语言。　　　　　　　　戴知贤
