Title: "Peace and Prosperity"—A Critique of the US Republican Party's Campaign Platform

"Peace and Prosperity" is the slogan that the US Republican Party has long selected for this year's election campaign. The campaign platform adopted by the Republican National Convention this time is built around this slogan. "Peace and Prosperity" is undoubtedly what the American people unanimously demand. The slogan itself is not bad and can move voters.

The problem lies in how to achieve genuine peace and prosperity for the American people. This is also where the Republican Party's difficulty lies.

Since the spring of this year, some relatively serious downward trends in the US economy have not fundamentally improved. The Republican Party is the ruling party, and this autumn and winter are crucial junctures for the economy; overly recent blank checks cannot be casually issued. It can be seen that the Republican Party is very uneasy about "prosperity" in the current economic situation. The platform boasted about the "prosperity" since the Republican Party came to power, but compared to Eisenhower's State of the Union address in January this year, the tone has been significantly lowered. Eisenhower's acceptance speech at the party convention on August 23rd essentially abandoned "prosperity" and focused on "peace," which was a last resort. The entire campaign platform neither clearly pointed out the prospects for "prosperity" nor proposed specific measures to maintain "prosperity." Obviously, the Republican Party has realized that the "prosperity" card is difficult to play effectively.

Indeed, whether from the campaign platform or from Eisenhower's acceptance speech, "peace" has become the main content of the campaign slogan. However, even on the issue of peace, the Republican Party's situation is not enviable. Apart from the Korean armistice, the Republican Party cannot produce any "peace" bill to be reimbursed to voters. The Republican Party has adopted the tactic of distorting facts and fabricating false "peace" accounts to deceive the people. However, false accounts are ultimately false and cannot withstand the test of facts. No wonder the New York "World-Telegram and Sun" editorial also criticized the Republican Party for "calling black white," and the Associated Press reporter called it "deceptive talk."

In its campaign platform, the Republican Party reiterated its continued support for aggressive military alliances, vigorously promoted the policy of "strength," and guaranteed to continue seeking the "liberation" of the people of the people's democratic countries. It also boasted of its achievements in splitting Korea, Vietnam, Germany, and interfering in Guatemala in the past few years. What the Republican Party is actually advocating is the old anti-peace "Cold War" policy. Despite the countless "peace" words used in the platform, it ultimately cannot conceal this essence.

At a time when people all over the world are demanding peaceful coexistence and the international situation is definitely tending towards relaxation, the platform emphasizes threatening and inflammatory words such as "strength," "striking force," "striking capability," and "new weapons and retaliatory power." On August 22, "New York Times" reporter Sulzberger pointed out that these words such as "strike" and "retaliation" were debated and finally deleted in the 1952 Republican campaign platform, but were passed and appeared in this year's platform. This is worth noting. Democratic Senator Rayburn criticized the Republican Party for "valuing the tools of weapons and not the tools of peace." Obviously, the "peace" pursued by the Republican Party with "weapon tools" is not the peace required by the American people at all.

The platform grandly declares: "Looks forward to the ultimate end of colonialism"; but on the other hand, it specifically expresses its intention to maintain bases around the world and to help "friendly countries" maintain local troops as a "first line of defense." The platform avoids mentioning the just demands of the people of Japan, Iceland, the Philippines, and other countries for the United States to withdraw its troops and return its bases. On the Goa issue, the West Irian issue, the Cyprus issue, and the Algerian issue, the United States has adopted a position of supporting colonialism, which the platform also avoids mentioning. Now, on the Suez Canal issue, the United States appears to be the bodyguard of colonialism. Listen to its words and observe its actions. The colonialist position that the US ruling group has consistently implemented in its actions can never be covered up by the empty words of "looking forward to the ultimate end of colonialism."

Regarding the economic status of small businesses, the revision of the Taft-Hartley Act, and the improvement of the agricultural economy, only empty promises are made, and no specific and effective measures are proposed. Even more ironic are some obviously hypocritical promises. The platform mentions eliminating trade barriers, but at the same time opposes free trade between East and West; the platform mentions willingness to expand contacts between countries, but just recently, the Republican government rigidly refused to approve American reporters to come to China for interviews.

As widely pointed out by all parties in the United States, this year's Republican campaign platform is not only essentially no different from the Democratic Party, but also has no difference from the Democratic Party in specific propositions on many issues. This year's Republican campaign strategy seems to be emphasizing Eisenhower's personal role. This shows on the one hand that the Republican Party's outdated slogan of "peace and prosperity" is no longer so able to bewitch people, and on the other hand, it is also because the platforms of the two parties actually have little difference.

Of course, the ruling Republican Party cannot completely ignore the domestic and international pressure for peace. There are also divisions within the Republican Party. In particular, the proposal to change foreign policy and adopt a moderate approach to adapt to peaceful coexistence is also increasingly gaining strong support within the American bourgeoisie and within the Republican Party. In his acceptance speech, Eisenhower said: "Fighting is not only miserable, but also stupid. ... The purpose now must be to ensure that such a war never happens." He also said: "A promising party must be fully committed to peace, and indeed all Americans must do so. Because, without peace, there is no future." Obviously, Eisenhower took into account the American people's demands for peace when he said these words.

However, even some Republicans are worried that using the same old empty slogans of "peace and prosperity" to deceive the people and win elections is not guaranteed. Associated Press reporter James Marlow pointed out that "the Democratic and Republican platforms are a combination of good intentions and pure political deception." If there are genuine good intentions, they cannot be limited to empty promises, but must make sincere efforts to achieve them. In this era, political deception will not last long. The people want to see whether the campaigning parties make sincere efforts and positive contributions to the genuine peace and prosperity they need.

    “和平与繁荣”
    ——评美国共和党竞选纲领
    纪隆
    “和平与繁荣”是美国共和党早已选定作为今年竞选用的口号。这次共和党全国代表大会所通过的竞选纲领就是环绕着这个口号做文章的。“和平与繁荣”毫无疑问是美国人民所一致要求的东西。这个口号并不坏，是可以打动选民的。
    问题在于怎样为美国人民实现真正的和平和繁荣。共和党的困难也就在这里。
    今年春天以来，美国经济方面所出现的某些比较严重的下降趋势，到现在还没有基本好转。共和党是执政党，而今年秋冬正是经济趋向的重要关头；过于近期的空头支票是不能随便开的。可以看出，共和党在当前的经济情况下对于“繁荣”十分心虚。纲领吹嘘了一阵共和党当政以后的“繁荣”，但是比起艾森豪威尔今年1月的国情咨文，语调已有显著的降低。8月23日艾森豪威尔在党代表大会上所发表的接受提名的演说事实上撇开了“繁荣”，专谈“和平”，是有不得已的苦衷的。整个竞选纲领既没有明确指出“繁荣”的前景，也没有提出维持“繁荣”的具体办法。显然共和党已经感觉到“繁荣”这张牌是难以打响了。
    确实，不论从竞选纲领或是从艾森豪威尔接受提名的演说来看，“和平”已经成为竞选口号的主要内容。但是，就是在和平的问题上，共和党的处境也并不令人羡慕。除了朝鲜停战以外，共和党是拿不出一分可以向选民报销的“和平”账单的。共和党采取了歪曲事实，捏造“和平”假账来欺骗人民。然而，假账终究是假的，经不起事实对证的，无怪纽约“世界电讯与太阳报”的社论也斥责共和党是“指黑为白”，美联社记者则称之为“哄人的话”。
    共和党在竞选纲领里重申要继续支持侵略性的军事同盟，竭力推销“实力”政策，并且保证要继续寻求“解放”人民民主国家的人民，还夸耀它在过去几年里分裂朝鲜、越南、德国和干涉危地马拉的成绩。共和党实际上鼓吹的就是那老一套反和平的“冷战”政策。尽管纲领里用了无数的“和平”字样，终究掩盖不了这一实质。
    当全世界人民要求和平共处、国际局势肯定趋向和缓的时候，纲领里却强调了“实力”、“打击力量”、“打击能力”、“新武器和报复力量”等等带有威胁性和火药气味的字眼。8月22日“纽约时报”上记者苏兹贝格指出，这些“打击”、“报复”字眼在1952年共和党竞选纲领中曾经经过争执而最后被删去，但是在今年的纲领里却获得通过而出现了。这是值得注意的。民主党参议员雷朋批评共和党“重视武器工具而不重视和平工具”。显然共和党用“武器工具”所追求的“和平”根本不是美国人民所要求的和平。
    纲领里冠冕堂皇地宣布：“期待着殖民主义的最终结束”；但另一方面却具体表示要维持在世界各地的基地，要帮助“友好国家”维持当地的部队作为“第一道堤防”。对于日本、冰岛、菲律宾等国人民要求美国撤退驻军、交还基地的正义要求，纲领里却避开，只字不提。对于果阿问题、西伊里安问题、塞浦路斯问题、阿尔及利亚问题，美国所采取的正是支持殖民主义的立场，纲领里也都避开不谈。现在，在苏彝士运河问题上，美国俨然是殖民主义的保镳。听其言而观其行，美国统治集团所贯穿于行动中的殖民主义的立场，决不是一句“期待着殖民主义的最终结束”的空话能够遮掩得了的。
    对于小企业的经济地位，对于修改塔夫脱—哈特莱法，对于改善农业经济，都只是作了空洞的诺言，并没有提出具体有效的办法。更有讽刺性的是一些明显的口是心非的诺言。纲领里提到要消除贸易障碍，但同时反对东西方的自由贸易；纲领里提到愿意扩大各国之间的接触，但就在眼前，共和党政府僵硬地拒绝批准美国记者到中国来采访。
    正如美国各方面所广泛指出的，共和党今年的竞选纲领，不仅在实质上同民主党没有什么不同，就是在许多问题上的具体主张也是同民主党没有什么差别的。今年共和党竞选的策略看来是强调艾森豪威尔的个人作用。这一方面说明共和党的“和平与繁荣”的陈旧口号已不再那样能蛊惑人心，另一方面也是由于两党纲领实际上并无多大差别。
    当然，执政的共和党对于国内外要求和平的压力并不是可以完全不加理会的。共和党内部也不是没有分歧的。特别是要求改变对外政策，采取和缓做法以适应和平共处的主张，在美国资产阶级内部和共和党内部也正在日益得到有力的支持。艾森豪威尔在接受提名时发表的演说中说：“战斗不仅是悲惨的，而且是愚蠢的。……现在的目的必须是务使这种战争根本不会发生。”他还说：“一个有前途的政党必须完全致力于和平，而确实一切美国人也必须这样做。因为，没有和平，就没有将来。”显然，艾森豪威尔在说这些话的时候，是估计到美国人民的和平要求的。
    但是，用老一套空洞的“和平与繁荣”的口号，来欺骗人民、赢得选举，连共和党内也有人担心是没有把握的。美联社记者詹姆斯·马劳指出，“民主党和共和党的政纲是良好的意图和纯粹的政治欺骗加起来的东西”。如果真有良好的意图，就不能仅限于空洞的诺言，而必进行真诚的努力去实现它。在这个时代，政治欺骗是混不久的。人民要看竞选的政党是否为他们所需要的真正的和平和繁荣作出真诚的努力和积极的贡献。
