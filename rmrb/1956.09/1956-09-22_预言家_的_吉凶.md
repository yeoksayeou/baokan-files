    The "Fortune" of the "Prophets"
    "A 'Black Friday' is coming soon!" Some "prophets" in London and Paris have recently issued such warnings. It is said that on that terrible day, Egyptian "mobs" will use terror tactics such as robbery, arson, and even massacre to deal with Europeans.
    Amid such "prophecies," the British and French embassies in Egypt have asked British and French expatriates in Egypt to evacuate and return home to "take refuge."
    However, the British and French expatriates in Egypt are unwilling to base their actions on the "fortune" predicted by those "prophets." A piece of news from Agence France-Presse revealed some information about this. The news said: There are an estimated 11,000 French expatriates in Egypt, but so far only a few hundred have agreed to evacuate. Some have even obtained the right to free passage by ship, but are unwilling to leave Egypt. Therefore, the 10,000-ton Italian ship "Aurelia," which the French government specially chartered to evacuate expatriates, has been rendered useless.
    Agence France-Presse reported: "Most of these French citizens were either born in Egypt or have lived here for a long time. Therefore, they are unwilling to leave."
    Obviously, those expatriates are unwilling to evacuate from Egypt, not because they intend to risk "extraordinary disasters," but because they simply do not believe the "prophecies" about a possible "Black Friday" in Egypt. They have long-term life experience in Egypt and know that the Egyptian people are peaceful and also have the ability to distinguish between foreign colonialists and ordinary foreign expatriates.
    So, what do those "prophets" rely on to predict the "fortune" of foreign expatriates in Egypt? They are not fortune-telling charlatans who believe in astrology and divination, but conspirators with ulterior motives. Taking this "prophecy" as a basis, Britain and France are clamoring to "protect" their citizens and property in Egypt, and have sent a large number of troops to Cyprus, brandishing their swords menacingly on the front lines only 250 miles away from the Suez Canal area.
    However, these "prophets" have forgotten to predict their own "fortune." In fact, if they continue like this, their future is truly "more ominous than auspicious," and they will inevitably be burned by a great anti-colonial fire. Only by being more sober, sheathing their swords, and peacefully resolving the Suez Canal dispute on the principle of respecting Egyptian sovereignty can they still "turn bad luck into good."

### “预言家”的“吉凶”

    “预言家”的“吉凶”
    “一个‘黑色的星期五’快要到来了！”伦敦和巴黎有一些“预言家”最近发出了这样的警告。据说，在那个可怕的日子里，埃及的“暴民”将会用抢劫、纵火甚至屠杀等等恐怖手段来对付欧洲人。
    在这样的“预言”声中，英法两国驻埃及大使馆就要求在埃及的英法侨民赶紧撤退，回国去“避难”。
    但是，在埃及的英法侨民们并不愿意根据那些“预言家”所推断的“前途吉凶”来决定自己的行动。关于这一点，法新社的一条消息透露了一些情况。这条消息说：在埃及估计约有一万一千个法国侨民，然而直到现在只有少数几百个人同意撤退。有些人虽然已经得到了免费乘船的权利，但是也不愿意离开埃及。因此，法国政府专门为了撤退侨民而租来的一艘一万吨的意大利船“奥雷利亚”号，只好英雄无用武之地了。
    法新社消息指出：“这些法国公民中的大多数人，不是在埃及出生的，就是已经长期居住在这里。因此他们都不愿意离开。”
    显然，那些侨民不愿意从埃及撤退，并不是打算冒“奇灾大祸”，而是根本不相信关于在埃及可能发生什么“黑色的星期五”的“预言”。他们在埃及有长期的生活经历，知道埃及人民是和平的，也有能力把外国殖民主义者和普通的外国侨民区别开来。
    那末，那些“预言家”是凭什么来为在埃及的外国侨民推断“前途吉凶”的呢？他们倒也不是相信星相巫卜的江湖术士，而是别有用心的阴谋家。就是拿这个“预言”作根据，英法大叫要“保护”它们在埃及的公民和财产，就抽了大批兵将到塞浦路斯，在离开苏伊士运河区只有二百五十英里的阵地上杀气腾腾地挥舞起战刀来了。
    然而，这些“预言家”忘了推断一下自己的“前途吉凶”。其实，他们像现在这样走下去，前途倒真是“凶多吉少”，免不了一场反殖民主义的大火烧身。只有清醒一些，收起军刀，在尊重埃及主权的原则下和平解决苏伊士运河的纠纷，还可以“逢凶化吉”。　（袁）
