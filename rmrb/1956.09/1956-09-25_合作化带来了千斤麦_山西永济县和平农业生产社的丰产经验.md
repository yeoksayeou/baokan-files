Our Heping Advanced Agricultural Production Cooperative planted over 9,654 mu of winter wheat last autumn, and achieved a generally good harvest this year. The average yield per mu was 200 jin, an increase of 33.3% over last year. Among them, 2,185 mu yielded 446 jin per mu. The Third Production Team had more than 5.2 mu of replanted wheat, with an average actual yield of 1,023 jin and 3 liang of dry wheat per mu.

This high-yield land is irrigated land with two crops a year, and the soil quality is similar to that of the local general land. In the past, it only yielded more than 100 jin of wheat per mu. For the past two years, it has been used as a high-yield experimental field to cultivate soil fertility. Last year, each mu yielded more than 400 jin of wheat and 420 jin of corn. This year, the wheat yield exceeded 1,000 jin. The reason for achieving such a high yield, besides the relatively favorable rainfall in the spring, is mainly because the establishment of the advanced agricultural production cooperative, under the specific leadership of the Party and the government, has enabled us to better improve technology and unleash the land's potential for increased production. Our cooperative launched a labor competition this spring, learned scientific technologies and advanced experiences, and appointed experienced people as technicians to be responsible for mastering the technology.

	Forty Hundred Thousand Ears Per Mu

In the past, our wheat fields generally had only more than 100,000 ears of wheat per mu, with each ear bearing 17 or 18 grains. More than 18,000 wheat grains weighed one jin, meaning the average yield per mu was only more than 100 jin. To achieve a good harvest this year, from a technical point of view, the main change was to overcome this situation of few ears, few grains, and small grains.

Our thousand-jin high-yield field has more than 408,500 ears of wheat per mu. The main reason for the increase in wheat ears is the implementation of reasonable close planting. We used to sow only 10 jin of seeds per mu, at most no more than 12 jin. This year's thousand-jin field used 22 jin of seeds per mu, equivalent to more than 330,000 wheat grains. Furthermore, the row spacing was reduced from 7 or 8 cun to 5.5 cun. The narrowing of the row spacing increased the number of rows of wheat, so although the amount of seeds sown increased, the number of seeds within each row did not increase much. The wheat seedlings were not densely packed and could all grow and bear ears well.

In the past, not only were few seeds sown, but many wheat grains often failed to germinate and emerge from the soil because the land was not prepared in time and moisture was not conserved well. Furthermore, due to rough plowing and harrowing, there were many soil clods, the ground was uneven, and the soil was not compacted. Coupled with poor seeder technology, the sowing density was uneven, and the soil cover was of inconsistent depth. As a result, there was often more than 20% of missing seedlings and broken rows. This thousand-jin wheat field, after harvesting corn in the rain at the end of September last year, cleared the stubble roots after the weather cleared up and deep-harrowed it twice. After loosening the soil, it was deep-plowed once with a double-wheel double-furrow plow. After plowing, it was finely harrowed twice to crush the surface soil clods and conserve moisture. Then, basal fertilizer was applied, followed by a deep furrowing with a plow without a moldboard to mix the fertilizer with the soil. After plowing, it was immediately finely harrowed and leveled. Before sowing, it was shallowly furrowed once again with a plow without a moldboard to lift the soil clods beneath the surface, which were then crushed by harrowing, and finely harrowed twice. After such deep plowing and shallow furrowing, and fine harrowing and leveling, the soil clods were finely crushed and evenly mixed, the ground was flat, the soil was loose on top and firm underneath, and sufficient moisture was conserved. When sowing, Liang Wenhua, an experienced technician, operated the seeder to ensure consistent depth and even density, resulting in uniform and orderly seedling emergence. The seedling establishment rate was over 95%, with an average of 1.3 tillers per wheat seedling.

Due to the implementation of reasonable close planting and improved land preparation and sowing techniques, overcoming missing seedlings and broken rows, and having more and neater seedlings, we achieved more plants and more ears.

	One Ear with Thirty-Six Grains

On the basis of having more and neater seedlings, the second step is to enable each wheat seedling to grow strong and healthy, achieving large ears with many grains.

To make wheat seedlings grow well, they must be "well-fed." Our thousand-jin wheat field used an average of 16,200 jin of manure, 47 jin of ammonium sulfate, and 15 jin of superphosphate per mu. The quality of the manure was relatively high, containing 50% livestock manure. The application of fertilizer needs to take into account the variety. In the past, we planted "Red Wheat," and applying too much fertilizer would cause lodging. The thousand-jin field was planted with "Bi Ma No. 1," a well-known high-yielding variety successfully introduced and tested by the Yuncheng Agricultural Experiment Station for several years. This variety has tall stalks, large ears, and many grains, and is relatively resistant to fertilizer and not prone to lodging, so more fertilizer was applied.

Fertilizer must also be applied at the right time. Before cooperation, labor was not well allocated, and summer farming was busy, so we accumulated little manure. We often applied only surface manure for wheat planting, without basal fertilizer. The fertilizer effect was slow to develop, resulting in poor tillering of wheat seedlings before the year and the growth of many "secondary tillers" after the year, some of which formed small ears and some of which did not form ears. This year's thousand-jin field applied 9,000 jin of manure as basal fertilizer, so the tillering was neat and strong. Before winter, another 7,200 jin of manure was spread on each mu to cover the wheat seedlings and protect them from freezing over winter. We call it "warm ditch manure." These fertilizers, combined with spring harrowing after spring, were harrowed into the soil and slowly exerted their fertilizing effect, playing a role in long-term fertilizer supply. Before jointing, 16 jin of ammonium sulfate was applied per mu with a seeder. This fertilizer has a fast fertilizing effect, and watering immediately after application immediately made it work. At this time, the tender wheat ears in the wheat seedlings were elongating, and timely topdressing and watering ensured large ears and many grains. Surveys conducted by the Yuncheng Agricultural Experiment Station this year on large-scale high-yield fields proved that topdressing at this stage resulted in 3.7 to 12.4 more wheat grains per ear compared to not topdressing.

In addition to timely and sufficient supply of fertilizer, attention must also be paid to preventing disasters such as cold, drought, diseases, and insects from harming it. Therefore, we attach great importance to timely sowing. As the saying goes, "Wheat has no second vigorous growth." Sowing too early will lead to vigorous growth before the year, which will be damaged by frost. Sowing too late will result in poor tillering and rooting, and it will also be less resistant to cold. Our thousand-jin field applied more fertilizer, and the wheat seedlings grew quickly. The "Bi Ma No. 1" variety is also prone to vigorous growth before the year. According to the experimental results of the Wanrong County Farm in our neighboring county last year, "Northwest No. 60" wheat sown during the Cold Dew period had a 14.3% reduction in yield compared to sowing during the Autumn Equinox, but "Bi Ma No. 1" had a 46% increase in yield. Therefore, we sowed five days after the Cold Dew last year, which was later than the general planting time, to prevent vigorous growth and frost damage. When it was about to freeze, the wheat field was rolled once to make the soil particles and wheat roots tightly connected, so as to avoid breaking the wheat roots when the ground froze and thawed. According to the experimental results of the Yuncheng Agricultural Experiment Station, winter rolling of wheat increased the number of grain-bearing ears by 30.2% and increased the average number of wheat grains per ear by four compared to not rolling.

Our area suffers from severe spring droughts. In early spring, we harrowed once while the ground was still freezing to prevent the loss of soil moisture after the ground thawed. The experimental results of the Yuncheng Agricultural Experiment Station told us that the soil moisture content below the surface of the wheat field harrowed in early spring was 21.9% after one and a half months, while the moisture content of the unharrowed field was only 19.1%. After the wheat seedlings turned green, we watered once in combination with topdressing. In order to make the watering even and thorough, the number of ridges was increased from seven or eight per fen to twelve, and the amount of watering was controlled to penetrate five cun deep. We hoed and loosened the soil in time after watering and hoed again later to prevent the water in the field from evaporating and to remove weeds, thus preventing spring drought. During this period, wheat stem borers and red spiders were found in the wheat field, and 0.5% of 666 powder was sprayed twice in time. In addition, we used cyanamide powder to mix the seeds before sowing, so there was also very little of the commonly prevalent wheat black powder disease.

Because we supplied the wheat seedlings with the fertilizer they needed in time and prevented the harm of cold, drought, diseases, and insects, the wheat plants grew strong and healthy, with large ears and many grains. The Yuncheng Agricultural Experiment Station and the cadres stationed in the cooperative by the Yongji County Party Committee helped us measure: plant height of 129 cm, stalk thickness of 1.34 cm, ear length of 7.76 cm, an average of 16.9 spikelets per ear, of which 14.6 were grain-bearing spikelets, with an average of about 36 grains per ear, and a maximum of 120 grains.

	Thirteen Thousand Grains to a Jin

After heading, the key to striving for a higher yield is to ensure sufficient grain filling and large and plump grains.

The prerequisite for plump and large wheat grains is the healthy growth of wheat seedlings. Therefore, our efforts in the previous period not only ensured more plants and more ears, and large ears with many grains, but also created conditions for large and plump grains.

We seized the last opportunity to topdress each mu with 16 jin of ammonium sulfate and water once, penetrating six cun deep, when the wheat plants were about to spike. At this time, the wheat ears had grown, and timely supply of fertilizer and water promoted the wheat leaves to produce more nutrients to fill the wheat grains. After flowering, we topdressed with granular fertilizer made of 15 jin of ammonium sulfate and 15 jin of superphosphate, and watered thoroughly once. During the grain-filling period, we watered once again. At this time, the function of the wheat plants to produce nutrients had weakened, and the main task was to transfer the already-produced nutrients from the stems and leaves to the wheat grains. Timely watering promoted this function.

In our area, jaundice disease is very prevalent. Wheat that grows well will produce shriveled and thin grains once it develops jaundice. For example, during the great jaundice epidemic in 1950, the wheat grains were so small that more than 30,000 grains were needed to make one jin. We paid attention to this early on, so we selected the "Bi Ma No. 1" variety. This variety has strong resistance to jaundice. When other varieties are infected with jaundice and full of yellow powder, it still has green stems and leaves and is not harmed at all. In addition, this variety has large grains, and our set of cultivation techniques fully utilized this characteristic. As a result, the grains were all large and plump, and only more than 13,400 grains were needed to make one jin.

	To Further Strive for Mu-Mu Thousand Jin

The emergence of the thousand-jin mu has given us a lot of vivid and practical education on high yield, making us realize the importance of technological reform. However, we still have many shortcomings in technology. For example, according to the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, to obtain an income of 400 jin per mu of wheat, it absorbs 13.3 jin of nitrogen, 4.6 jin of phosphorus, and 10 jin of potassium from the soil. According to the calculation of the Yuncheng Agricultural Experiment Station, the fertilizer we applied was equivalent to more than 48 jin of nitrogen, 21.8 jin of phosphorus, and 51.3 jin of potassium per mu, but the yield was only over 1,000 jin. Obviously, the fertilizer we applied did not fully exert its fertilizing effect. Although the large amount of warm ditch manure we applied played a role in preventing frost and protecting seedlings, a large amount of fertilizer was lost after a winter of sun and wind exposure on the ground. The last application of granular fertilizer was also too late and had little effect. For another example, in the 5-mu thousand-jin field, one plot of 2.07 mu was watered one less time. A comparison of single harvest and single threshing showed that this plot yielded 10% less.

We have a total of more than 9,000 mu of wheat fields, and only more than 5 mu achieved a thousand-jin yield. Therefore, we will never be complacent. We must study harder and work harder, strive for Mu-Mu Thousand Jin, and further improve the yield of the thousand-jin field.

    合作化带来了千斤麦
    山西永济县和平农业生产社的丰产经验
    我们和平高级农业生产合作社，去秋种了九千六百五十四亩多冬小麦，今年普遍得到了丰收。每亩平均产量二百斤，比去年提高了33.3％。其中有二千一百八十五亩，亩产四百四十六斤。第三生产队有五亩二分多回茬小麦，每亩平均实收干麦一千零二十三斤三两。
    这块高额丰产地是一年两熟的水浇地，土质和当地一般土地差不多，过去每亩只收小麦一百多斤。两年来作了丰产试验地，培养了地力，去年每亩收小麦四百多斤，玉米四百二十斤，今年小麦收到千斤以上。为什么达到这样高的产量，除了春季雨水比较调和外，主要是因为在党和政府的具体领导下，组织起了高级农业生产合作社，能够更好地改进技术，发挥了土地的增产潜力。我们社今春曾开展了劳动竞赛，学习科学技术和先进经验，并且确定了有经验的人当技术员，负责掌握技术。
    每亩四十万穗
    在往年，我们的麦田，每亩一般只有十多万个麦穗，每穗结实十七、八粒，每一万八千多颗麦粒才称到一斤，即平均每亩产量只有一百多斤。今年获得丰收，从技术上来看，主要就是改变了这种穗数少、结粒少、籽粒小的情况。
    我们的千斤丰产田，每亩有四十万八千五百多个麦穗，麦穗增多的主要原因是实行了合理密植。我们向来每亩地只下十斤种子，至多不过十二斤。今年的千斤田，每亩下种二十二斤，合三十三万多麦粒。并且把七、八寸的行距缩小到五寸半。行距缩窄，种麦的行数增加了，因而下种量虽然增多，但每一麦行内的种子并没有增加很多，麦苗并不密挤，都能长好生长结穗。
    往年，不但下种少，而且很多麦粒常常因为整地不及时，保墒不好，发不了芽，出不了土。又因为耕耙粗糙，土坷垃多，地面不平整，土壤不踏实，加上摇耧技术不好，下种稀密不匀，盖土深浅不一，结果常常有20％以上的缺苗断垅。这块千斤麦田，去年九月底，雨中抢收了玉米，天晴后随即刨去茬根，深耙了两遍，把土耙松后，就用双轮双铧犁深耕翻了一道，耕后细耙了两遍，耙碎地面土块，把墒保住，然后撒施基肥，接着用不带犁镜的犁深耩了一次，让肥料和土壤混匀，耕后随即耙细耱平。播种前，又用不带犁镜的犁浅串了一道，串起地面下土块，随即耱碎，并细耙了两遍。经过这样深耕浅串，精细耙耱，土块细碎匀和，地面平整，上虚下实，并保蓄了充足的水分，播种时，由有经验的技术员梁文华摇耧，做到深浅一致，稀密均匀，因而出苗均匀整齐，成苗率在95％以上，平均每一麦苗长了一点三个分杈。
    由于实行了合理密植和提高了整地播种技术，克服了缺苗断垅，苗多苗齐，所以做到了株多穗多。
    一穗三十六粒
    在苗多苗齐的基础上，第二步是让每一株麦苗都能生长健壮，达到穗大粒多。
    要麦苗长好，一定得让它“吃饱”。我们的千斤麦田，平均每亩共施用了一万六千二百斤圈粪，四十七斤硫酸铵和十五斤过磷酸钙、圈粪的质量是比较高的，其中含有50％的牲口粪。施用肥料，需要看品种，过去我们种的是“红麦”，多上了粪就会倒伏，千斤田种的是运城农业试验站几年来引种试验成功的著名丰产品种“碧蚂一号”，这个品种秆高、穗大，结粒多，比较耐肥不易倒，所以就较多地施用了肥料。
    肥料还必须施在火候上。在合作化以前，劳力没有得到很好调配，夏季农活忙，积肥少，我们种麦常常只上浮粪，不上基肥，肥劲发得慢，结果麦苗年前分杈不好，年后长出很多“二杈子”，有些结成小的麦穗，有些长不成穗。今年的千斤田，施用了九千斤圈粪作基肥，所以分杈整齐健壮，冬前，每亩地里又撒施了七千二百斤圈粪，复盖麦苗，保护麦苗越冬不受冻，我们管它叫“暖沟粪”。这些肥料，开春后结合春耙，耙入土中，慢慢发挥肥效，起着长期补给肥料的作用。拔节前，每亩地又用耧施用了十六斤硫酸铵，这种肥料肥效快，施用后又紧接着浇了一次水，立刻就使上了劲。这时，麦苗中的幼嫩麦穗正在伸长，及时追肥浇水，保证了穗子大，粒子多。运城农业试验站今年大面积丰产调查证明：这时期追肥比不追的每穗要多结三点七到十二点四颗麦粒。
    除及时足量地供给肥料外，还要注意不让寒、旱、病、虫等灾害来损害它。因此，我们很重视适期播种，俗话说：“麦无二旺”，种早了年前发旺，就会受冻，种晚了分不好杈，扎不好根，也不耐寒。我们的千斤田施肥较多，麦苗长得快，种的“碧蚂一号”品种又容易在年前发旺。据我们邻县万荣县农场去年试验的结果，“西北六○号”小麦在寒露播种的比秋分播种的减产14.3％，但“碧蚂一号”却增产46％。所以我们去年在寒露后五天播种，比一般地种的晚些，防止了发旺受冻。快结冻时，又把麦田压了一次，使土粒和麦根密接起来，免得地一冻一化时抬断麦根。据运城农业试验站试验的结果，冬季压麦比不压的，每亩结实麦穗数目增加了30.2％，每一麦穗平均多结了四个麦粒。
    我们这个地区，春旱很严重，在早春，我们顶凌耙了一次，阻止地解冻后土壤水分的散失。运城农业试验站试验的结果告诉我们，早春耙麦的地，一个半月后，地面下土壤含水量为21.9％，没有耙的只有19.1％。麦苗返青后，结合追肥，浇了一次水，为了使水浇得匀透，由过去每分地七、八个畦增加到十二个畦，并且掌握浇水量透地五寸深。浇后及时锄地松土，后来又锄了一次，不让地里的水蒸发掉，并除去杂草，这样，防止了春旱。这期间，麦田中曾发现了麦芽虫和红蜘蛛，及时用0.5％的六六六药粉喷了二次，另外，在播种前我们曾用赛力散药粉拌了种，所以也很少有当地常常流行的秆黑粉病。
    由于这样及时供应了麦苗所需要的肥料，防止了寒、旱、病、虫的侵害，所以麦株生长健壮，穗大粒多。运城农业试验站和中共永济县委驻社干部帮助我们测定：株高一百二十九厘米，秆粗一点三四厘米，穗长七点七六厘米，每穗平均有一六点九个小穗，其中有一四点六个结实小穗，平均每穗结实三十六粒左右，最多的达到一百二十粒。
    一万三千粒一斤
    抽穗后，争取多收的关键在保证灌浆充足，颗粒壮大饱满。
    麦粒结得壮大饱满的先决条件是麦苗生长健壮。因此，我们前一时期的工夫，不仅保证了株多穗多，穗大粒多，同时，也为粒大粒壮创造了条件。
    我们抓紧最后的机会，在麦株将要吐穗时，每亩地又追施了十六斤硫酸铵，并浇了一次水，透地六寸深。这时，麦穗已长成了，及时供给肥料水分，促使麦叶能制造更多的养料，充实麦粒。扬花后，我们又追施了由十五斤硫酸铵和十五斤过磷酸钙做成的颗粒肥料，并浇了一次透水。到灌浆期间，又浇了一次水，这时，麦株制造养料的作用已减弱，主要是把已造好的养料从茎叶中转送到麦粒中去，及时浇水促进了这个作用。
    我们这个地区，黄疸病很流行，长得好好的麦子，一起了疸，结的麦粒便又瘪又瘦，如1950年黄疸病大流行，麦粒小到要三万多粒才能称到一斤。我们早注意了这一点，所以选用了“碧蚂一号”品种。这个品种抗疸力强，别个品种长了疸满是黄粉时，它还茎叶全绿，一点不受害。加上这一个品种的颗粒大，我们的一套栽培技术，充分发挥了它这个特性，结果粒粒壮大饱满，每一万三千四百多粒就可以称到一斤。
    要进一步争取亩亩千斤
    千斤亩的出现，给我们不少丰产的生动实际的教育，使我们认识到技术改革的重要。但是，我们在技术上还有不少缺点。例如：根据苏联先进经验：小麦要得到每亩四百斤的收入，从土壤中吸收氮十三点三斤，磷四点六斤，钾十斤。我们所施的肥料，据运城农业试验站的测算，每亩折合氮四十八斤多，磷二十一点八斤，钾五十一点三斤，但产量只有一千多斤。显然，我们所施的肥料没有充分发挥肥效。我们所施的大量暖沟粪虽然起了防冻护苗的作用，但露在地面上，经过一冬天的日晒风吹，肥份损失很大。最后施用的一次颗粒肥料，时间上也嫌迟了，作用不大。再如：在五亩多千斤田内，有二亩零七厘的一块少浇了一次水，单收单打比较的结果，这一块地少收了10％。
    我们的麦田一共有九千多亩，得到千斤产量的只有五亩多。所以，我们决不自满，我们要再学习，再努力，争取亩亩千斤，并还要把千斤田的产量再向上提高一步。
