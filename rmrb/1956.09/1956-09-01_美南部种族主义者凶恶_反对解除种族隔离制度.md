Xinhua News Agency, New York, August 31st: As the new school year begins in the southern United States, racists are intensifying their persecution of Black people in an attempt to prevent public schools from implementing the U.S. Supreme Court's decision to end segregation.

On August 29, when twelve Black students in Clinton, Tennessee, entered the formerly segregated Clinton High School, the notorious "White Citizens' Council" gathered a mob to shout abuse and threats at the students, one of whom was beaten. As a result, the twelve students were called out by the principal before they had finished their classes and sent home in a police car dispatched by the police department.

In Bryson City, North Carolina, when the parents of five Black students accompanied their children to Swain County High School on August 30, the school principal blocked them at the school gate and told them that their children had been assigned to the Swain County Black High School.

Governor Stanley of Virginia said that he would rather close all public schools in the state than allow any public school to end segregation.

    美南部种族主义者凶恶
    反对解除种族隔离制度
    据新华社31日讯　纽约消息：美国南部各地的种族主义分子在美国学校新学年开始的时候加紧迫害黑人，企图阻止公立学校执行美国最高法院的决定：解除种族隔离制度。
    8月29日，当田纳西州克林顿城的十二个黑人学生进入本来实行隔离制度的克林顿中学的时候，臭名昭著的“白人公民委员会”纠合了一群暴徒对这些学生吆喝恐吓，其中有一个黑人学生还挨了打。结果，这十二个学生还没有上完课，就被校长叫出来，由警察局派来的警备车把他们送回家。
    在北卡罗来纳州的布里森城，当五个黑人学生的家长8月30日陪他们的子弟进入斯温县立中学的时候，这个学校的校长在校门口拦住了他们，并且对他们说，他们的子弟已经被分配到斯温县立黑人中学去了。
    弗吉尼亚州长斯坦莱说，他宁可关闭这个州的全部公立学校，而绝不让任何一个公立学校解除种族隔离制度。
