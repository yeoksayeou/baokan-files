An Unusual Mastic Asphalt Prefabrication Plant
    ——Notes from a Conversation with Female Lab Technician Wang Keying
    By Our Correspondent Liu Heng

    People Call Me a “Tomboy”
    I am someone who loves to talk, laugh, run, and jump, and many people call me a “tomboy.” They say that girls should be gentle and quiet, and only boys should be “wild” like me.
    In 1953, I went to the Anshan Metallurgical Chemical Construction Company, and they assigned me to the Construction Technology Section, making me spend all day copying and writing at a desk. Our section chief, Gong Baoren, was an old man in his sixties. His grandson was the same age as me, seventeen that year. Every day, when Chief Gong assigned me work, he would always pat my head, as if I weren't his colleague, but his grandson. After patting my head, he would hand me a roll of paper, saying, “Kid, hurry up and copy this, the engineering office needs it this afternoon.”
    When I opened the roll of paper, my eyes immediately glazed over! It was densely packed with numbers. What were these numbers saying? What was the use of copying these numbers? I didn't understand at all. Not understanding, I copied it haphazardly. After much effort, I finished copying and looked up at the clock: Oh, there was only one hour left before getting off work! I quickly threw the copied material on the section chief's desk, mumbled in my throat, “I'm going to the construction site!” and turned to leave.
    I liked going to the construction site. The construction site was tense, lively, and new. I saw that our empty space from yesterday had new foundations laid, I saw the building we were building getting taller and taller every day, standing up, I saw our construction site changing every day. I thought, “This is what it means to build socialism – but, what has my work brought to socialism?”
    Later, I liked going to the construction site also because I liked someone – but don't you dare tell anyone, even the person themselves doesn't know yet. This person was at the construction site. He was an ordinary person, not particularly special in appearance. But, every day, no matter how far I stood, among dozens or hundreds of people wearing the same clothes and working, I could recognize him at a glance, isn't that strange?
    One day, our section called me to a meeting. When I saw everyone's serious faces, I knew it wasn't good. Sure enough, no one said anything nice. They said I was disrupting labor discipline. I said, “Every day, the things you assign me to copy, haven't I copied them all? Every day, the work you assign me to do, haven't I done it all?” They said, “You copied the things assigned to you every day, but you copied several typos! You did the work assigned to you every day, but there's still a lot of work we want to assign you, and we can't find you anywhere!” They said, “Working has a clock. Leaving before the time is up is desertion!” Chief Gong, that Chief Gong who was like a grandfather, also said, “This child is just too playful and wild. It's like there are tigers tied to the desk and thorns on the bench, she can't sit still in the office.”
    That night, I locked myself in the office to write a letter. I wrote:
    “Dear Mom and Dad: I want to go back to Shenyang. They are all talking about me, they don't like me…”
    My eyes, which hadn't cried for a long time, suddenly started crying. Big tears dripped onto the paper, like pebbles.
              I Arrived at the Mastic Asphalt Prefabrication Plant
    This spring, our company wanted to build the Baotou Industrial Base and established a branch company. I followed a group of people from Anshan to Baotou.
    Spring comes very late to Baotou, and at the end of April, I was still wearing a puffy cotton coat to work. I was walking on the road when I suddenly heard a hurried sound of footsteps behind me, getting closer and louder. I turned around and saw technician Zhu Shoufu. It turned out he was chasing me, he wanted to talk to me.
    He asked me, “Little Wang, do you know? They are transferring you to our Mastic Asphalt Prefabrication Plant to be a lab technician!”
    I asked him, “What does the Mastic Asphalt Prefabrication Plant do? I've never heard of it.”
    He laughed, “How would you have heard of it? This is a newly established factory created by our branch company for factory-style construction. It's one of the best in China. The creation of this factory is the result of our humbly learning from advanced Soviet experience.”
    This technician Zhu was a graduate of an industrial vocational school. I had heard people say that when he spoke, he liked to quote from books. Listening to him today, what he said was indeed like what was written in a book. Seeing that I didn't understand, he explained to me in detail:
      “Mastic asphalt is a compound of four raw materials: asphalt, tar, hemp seed oil, and talc. It is an indispensable material in waterproofing projects. Take roof waterproofing projects for example. After the house is built, to avoid leaks, several layers of roofing felt must be laid on the roof. Roofing felt and roofing felt cannot be glued together. Therefore, a layer of mastic asphalt is brushed between them, allowing the mastic asphalt to act as a cementing agent.
      “Previously in Anshan, to produce mastic asphalt, we adopted the method of on-site batching and on-site cooking. That is, setting up several pots on-site and burning fires in the open air. The toxic gas from the asphalt spread everywhere in the air, easily causing poisoning, burns, fires, and other accidents. The construction was very uncivilized. At the same time, because it was freshly batched and freshly cooked, it often could not be done just right. Either too much was produced, or too little. Either the production was too fast, or too slow, and work stoppages frequently occurred. Moreover, various materials for preparing mastic asphalt and wood for burning were often thrown and placed randomly on the site, exposed to the sun and rain, resulting in great losses.
      “Now, with the establishment of the Mastic Asphalt Prefabrication Plant, the mastic asphalt can be pre-mixed and cooked in the factory and allowed to cool and solidify into blocks. Then, the prefabricated blocks are transported to the site. As much as is needed is transported. As much as is brushed is cooked. In this way, the various shortcomings mentioned above can be avoided one by one!”
    I thought, since this factory is so new and so important, I wonder how tall and beautiful it is!
    The next day, I arrived at the Mastic Asphalt Prefabrication Plant. After one look – haha, it was almost enough to make someone die laughing! Where was this a factory? This was a cattle and horse pen left behind by the villagers! The villagers had moved away, taking the cattle and horses with them, dismantling the doors and windows, and taking off the roof, leaving only these four mud walls! On the mud walls, several workers were plastering mud and laying straw to cover the roof. Next to the cattle and horse pen was a small mill house, where several workers were shoveling manure outside – it turned out they were building a bath pond for themselves!
    I looked at the workers' faces and recognized them all at once: Oh! Aren't they Zhou Jiaqun, Li Zizhou, Li Enhua, Liu Xubin...? Their group leader is Shi Wenli! Who didn't know them on the Anshan construction site? They were famous mischief-makers! They often arrived late and left early for work. Sometimes, after the waterproofing work was finished, the foreman would temporarily transfer them to dig earthwork or move bricks. They would say, “Technical workers doing the work of ordinary workers, this is ‘downsizing’! I'm not going!” Sometimes, they would reluctantly go. The foreman would say, “Pile the dug-out earth into a square shape so we can measure the earthwork and calculate the results.” And what did they do? They deliberately piled the dug-out earth into a winding shape like a long snake.
                  The Mischief-Makers Have All Changed
    Our dormitory was four or five li away from the Mastic Asphalt Prefabrication Plant, all on the plains. This place is very interesting – no matter where you stand, you can see very far. When I went to work in the morning, just as I stepped onto a small slope, I saw the construction site. Among a large area of tall red brick and red tile buildings, the mud house of our factory was like a small yellow spot.
    Every day, no matter how early I got up or how fast I walked, I was never the first to arrive at the factory. From far away, I would see several black dots on the yellow spot – someone was already working on the roof. Every day after work, I always couldn't find anyone to go home with me. The workers were laying straw, plastering mud, building walls, and erecting beams, never finishing. Every day, they arrived early and left late, as if they were living in the open air waiting for the house to be built. Once, I suddenly thought, “Waterproofing technicians building a mud house, isn't that also ‘downsizing’?” and couldn't help but burst out laughing. But – after one look, there was no one around me laughing along with me. Because they didn't think there was anything funny about it. No! It turned out that when they were working, their ears and eyes weren't “wandering” at all, they didn't hear my laughter or see my smiling face at all!
    In addition to working, the workers often held meetings, talks, and engaged in inventions and creations.
    Once, I walked up to them and heard Shi Wenli say, “The toxic gas from asphalt is so strong. In the past, we only set up one or two large pots in the open air, and they burned with a roaring sound, suffocating the people next to them. Now, we have to install eight stoves in the house. With eight large pots burning together, how can people stay in the house?”
    Zhu Shoufu said, “We should find a good way to eliminate the toxic gas and ensure safe production. I have already flipped through several Soviet books. But, nothing is written in the books.”
    Shi Wenli said, “If it's not written in the books, then let's all think about it.”
    After a few days, our factory completely changed, becoming a very pleasant and comical sight. Inside the house: eight stoves were neatly lined up. On the stoves, eight bright white iron safety covers were neatly installed (the covers concealed eight invisible pots). On the covers, eight thin and slender chimneys stood up neatly, piercing through the roof. Outside the house: the eight chimneys piercing through the roof of the house were also neatly lined up on the roof, like eight soldiers doing exercises.
    I walked into the factory building and saw Li Enhua and Liu Xubin guarding the pot next to the pot with stirring sticks, cooking mastic asphalt. They kept stirring in the pot to prevent lumps from forming. Their hands were tired and numb, and the sweat on their backs flowed like a small river. In the past, when stirring mastic asphalt in Anshan, the workers were also this tired, this numb, and this sweaty. At that time, they didn't say anything. But, now – they've changed! Li Enhua said, “Establishing a factory should look like a factory, can we always use brute force and suffer hardships like this?” Liu Xubin said, “Let's think of a rationalization proposal…” Soon, they proposed to the leaders: install a stirring rake inside the pot, or install several stirring blades, to replace manual stirring.
    I walked into the courtyard and saw Wang Chengming and several workers using brushes to brush off the mica powder (note) on the roofing felt. The shiny mica powder floated in the air, it was really beautiful. But, if it touched your face, your face would hurt. If it touched your eyes, your eyes would swell. In the past, when brushing mica powder in Anshan, the workers also often got their faces hurt and their eyes swollen. At that time, they didn't say anything. But, now – they've changed! Wang Chengming said, “Establishing a factory should look like a factory…” Soon, he and everyone else researched and developed a cleaning machine to replace manual brushing.
    Every day, someone is making rationalization proposals. Today a mobile pot, tomorrow a combined roofing material laying machine, the day after tomorrow something else…
    I asked Shi Wenli, "Why have all of you changed one by one since coming to Baotou?"
    He smiled and said, "Could we carry the name of 'backward' and sit on the train, sitting all the way to Baotou? This time when we boarded the train in Anshan, how many people saw us off! The leaders shook hands with us one by one, saying: 'The task of the Baotou Industrial Base this year is very large, you one person must be worth three!' 'When you arrive at the Baotou Industrial Base, you must build a new Mastic Asphalt Prefabrication Plant. There is no existing model for this factory. What it will look like is up to you to create.' 'Arriving at a new place and building a new factory, there will definitely be many difficulties. But, I believe in you, the more difficult, the more advanced experience will emerge! We are here waiting for your good news.' When we heard these words, we were so excited that we held a departure mobilization meeting on the train that night."
    After a while, the smile on Shi Wenli's face disappeared, and he put on a serious look, and said:
    "In the past, we often said that after liberation, the workers turned over and became masters. In reality, if we have become the masters of our own factory, does that mean we have become the masters of our own work? That's not necessarily the case! Take us for example, in the past when we cooked mastic asphalt in the open air, we often couldn't be the masters of our own work. When the wind blew, when it rained, when the roof was damp, when the weather was cold, work would have to stop immediately. After we finished working today, we didn't know what we would be doing tomorrow. After we cooked mastic asphalt in the morning, we didn't know if we would be transferred to carry bricks in the afternoon. Often everyone was working listlessly. But, now, we are going to build a Mastic Asphalt Prefabrication Plant, we want to let our work be controlled by ourselves, not affected by natural conditions! Whether this factory can be built, what it will look like when it is built, and whether it can be put into production as soon as possible is also completely decided by ourselves. We have already become the masters of our work, so naturally we must treat our work with the attitude of masters!"
      (Note) When the roofing felt is shipped from the factory in bundles, to prevent them from sticking together when heated, a layer of mica powder is coated on them. After the roofing felt is transported, the mica powder must be brushed off.

    不平常的玛?脂预制厂
    ——记女化验员王克颖的谈话
    本报记者　刘衡
    人们叫我“假小子”
    我是一个爱说爱笑爱跑爱跳的人，好多人都叫我：“假小子”。他们说，做姑娘的应该文文雅雅，安安静静的，只有男孩子才像我这样“野”。
    1953年，我到了鞍山冶金化学建筑公司，他们把我分到施工技术科，成天要我扒在办公桌子上面抄抄写写。我们的科长龚宝仁是个六十多岁的老头儿，他的孙子跟我一般大，那年都是十七岁。每天，龚科长给我分配工作，总要摸一摸我的头，就像我不是他的工作同志，就像我也是他的孙子一样。他摸完我的头，就递给我一卷纸，说：“小孩，赶快抄一抄，工程处下午等着要。”
    我把纸卷一打开，立刻，我的眼都看花了！上边密密麻麻的，尽是些数目字。这些数目字，说的是些什么呀？抄上这些数目字，有些什么用处呀？我一点弄不明白。弄不明白，我就稀里糊涂地抄。好容易抄完了，抬头一看钟：呀，离下班只有一个钟头了！我赶紧把抄好的东西往科长桌子上一丢，在喉咙里一咕噜：“我到工地去！”转身就往外边走。
    我喜欢到工地去。工地紧张、热闹、新鲜。我看见我们昨天的空地又打上了新的基础，我看见我们正在盖的房子一天一天长高，一天一天站起来，我看见我们的工地一天一变样。我想：“这才叫做建设社会主义哩——可是，我的工作给社会主义带来了什么？”
    以后，我喜欢到工地去，还因为我喜欢了一个人——你可千万不要讲呀，连人家本人还不知道呢。这个人就在工地上。他是一个普普通通的人，样子长得一点也不特别。可是，每天，不管我站多远，在几十个几百个穿着同样衣服干活的人当中，我一眼就能把他认出来，你说怪不怪？
    有一天，咱们科里喊我开会。我一看大伙儿都板着脸，就知道没有好事。果然，大伙儿嘴里就没说出好话。他们说我破坏了劳动纪律。我说：“每天，分给我抄的东西，我不是都抄了吗？每天，分给我做的工作，我不是都做了吗？”他们说：“每天分给你抄的东西，你是抄了。可是，抄出了好几个错字！每天分给你做的工作，你是做了。可是，还有好多没有分给你做的工作想分给你做，到处找不到你的影子！”他们说：“干活有钟点，不到钟点走了，就是开小差！”龚科长，那个像爷爷一样的龚科长也说：“这个小孩就是玩性大，心野。就像桌子上拴得有老虎，板凳上有刺，她在办公室里坐不住。”
    晚上，我一人关在办公室里写信。我写：
    “亲爱的爸爸妈妈：我想回沈阳。他们都在说我，他们都不喜欢我……”
    我好久不哭的眼睛突然哭起来了。大颗大颗的眼泪滴答、滴答地掉在纸上，像石头子儿一样。
              我到了玛?脂预制厂
    今年春天，咱们公司要建设包头工业基地，成立了分公司。我跟着一批人从鞍山到了包头。
    包头的春天是来得很迟的，四月底了，我还穿着胖胖的棉衣去上班。我正在路上走，忽然听见后边有一阵急急忙忙的脚步声，越来越近，越来越响。我一回头，就看见了技术员朱守甫。原来他在撵我，他想找我说话哩。
    他问我：“小王，你知道吗？要调你到咱们玛?脂预制厂做化验员啦！”
    我问他：“玛?脂预制厂是干什么的？怎么没有听说过？”
    他笑了：“你怎么会听说过？这是咱们分公司为了进行工厂化施工，新创立的一个工厂，在全中国也是数一数二的。这个工厂的创立，是咱们虚心学习苏联先进经验的结果。”
    这位朱技术员是工业专科学校毕业的学生。我早就听人说过，他一讲话，就爱翻书本。今天一听，他讲的话果然跟书上写的一个样。他见我听不明白，就详细地给我讲：
      “玛?脂是沥青、焦油、麻子油、滑石粉四种原料的化合物，是防水工程中不可缺少的材料。拿屋面防水工程说吧，房子盖好了，要避免漏雨，就要在房顶铺几层油毛毡。油毛毡和油毛毡之间，粘不拢来。因此，就在它们之间刷上一层玛?脂，让玛?脂来起一种胶结作用。
      “以前在鞍山生产玛?脂，我们是采取现场配料，现场熬制的办法。就是在现场安上几口锅，就在露天烧火。沥青的毒气随着空气满天飘散，容易发生中毒、烫伤、着火等事故，施工很不文明。同时，因为是现配料，现熬制，常常不能做到恰到好处。不是生产多了，就是少了。不是生产快了，就是慢了，经常发生停工事故。而且，配制玛?脂的各种材料以及烧火用的木材等等因为在现场乱扔乱放，日晒夜露，也要遭受很大损失。
      “现在，创立了玛?脂预制厂，就可以把玛?脂预先在工厂里配好熬制出来，让它冷却后凝成块状。然后，把预制块运到现场。用多少，就运多少。刷多少，就熬多少。这样，上面说的种种缺点就可以一一避免了！”
    我想，这个工厂既然这样新鲜，这样重要，不知该有多么高大，多么漂亮！
    第二天，我到了玛?脂预制厂。一看——哈哈，简直要把人笑死了！这哪里是个工厂呀？这是老乡丢下的一个牛马圈！老乡搬家把牛马都搬走了，把门窗拆了，把房子盖也揭了，光剩下这四堵泥巴墙！泥巴墙上，有几个工人正在抹泥铺草盖房顶。牛马圈旁边是一个小小的磨房，里头有几个工人正拿着铲子往外边铲马粪——原来他们在给自己修洗澡塘！
    我看了看工人们的脸，一下子就认出来了：咦！他们不是周家群、李子洲、李恩华、刘绪斌……吗？他们的组长叫史文礼！在鞍山工地上，谁不知道他们呀？他们是有名的调皮鬼！他们上工，经常晚来早走。有的时候，防水的活干完了，工长调他们临时去挖挖土方，搬搬砖头。他们说：“技术工人做普通工人的活，这是‘大变小’我不去！”有时勉勉强强去了。工长说：“你们把挖出的土堆个方形，好给你们量土方，计算成绩。”他们呢？故意把挖出的土堆得弯弯曲曲的像条长蛇。
                  调皮鬼都变了
    我们的宿舍离玛?脂预制厂有四、五里，都在平原上面。这个地方是十分有趣的——不管你站在哪里，你一看就能看好远。早晨我去上班，刚刚走上一个小坡，就看见了工地。在一大片红砖红瓦的高大建筑物当中，我们工厂的泥巴房子就像一块黄色的小斑。
    每天，不管我起得多早，走得多快，我总不是第一个到厂。老远老远，我就看见黄斑上有几个黑点——已经有人在房顶上面干活了。每天下班，我老是找不着人跟我一块回家。工人们铺草、抹泥、垒墙、搭梁，老是没有个完。每天他们都是早来晚走，就像是他们自己住在露天等着房子住似的。有一次，我忽然想起：“防水技术工人在盖泥巴房子，不也是‘大变小’吗？”就忍不住哈哈大笑起来。可是——一看，周围没有一个人跟着我笑。因为他们没有觉得这有什么可笑。不！原来他们干起活来，耳朵、眼睛一点也不打“野”，根本没有听见我的笑声，看见我的笑脸！
    工人们除掉干活，还经常在一块开会、谈话、搞发明创造。
    有一次，我走到他们跟前，听见史文礼说：“沥青的毒气这样大，以前在露天只安一两口大锅，还烧得呼呼响，人在旁边熏得不行。现在，要在房子里安八个炉子。八口大锅一起烧，房子里还能呆人吗？”
    朱守甫说：“我们应该找出一个排除毒气、保证安全生产的好法子。我已经翻了好几本苏联书。可是，书上都没有写。”
    史文礼说：“书上没有写，就让我们大伙儿来想一想。”
    过了几天，我们的工厂完全变了，变成一种十分愉快、滑稽的样子。房子里：一溜齐的砌着八个炉子。炉子上，一溜齐的安着八个明晃晃的白铁安全罩（罩子里罩着八个看不见的锅）。罩子上，一溜齐的竖着八根细长细长的烟囱，一直冲破了房顶。房子外边：那八根冲破房子顶的烟囱在房顶上面，也是一溜齐的排着队，就像八个上操的兵。
    我走进厂房，看见李恩华、刘绪斌拿着搅拌棍子守在锅的旁边熬玛?脂。他们不停的在锅里搅，防止锅里结疙瘩。他们的手又累又麻，脊背上的汗淌得像小河一样。以前在鞍山搅拌玛?脂，工人们也是这样累，这样麻，这样淌汗。那时他们没有说什么。可是，现在——他们变了！李恩华说：“建立工厂就应该有个工厂的样儿，还能老是这样出笨力气、受活罪吗？”刘绪斌说：“让我们想个合理化建议……”不久，他们就向领导提出：在锅里边安个搅拌耙子，或者安几片搅拌叶子，代替人工搅拌。
    我走到院子里，看见王成明跟几个工人在用刷子刷油毛毡上的云母粉（注）。亮晶晶的云母粉在空中飘飘真好看。可是，它挨着你的脸，你的脸就疼。它挨着你的眼睛，你的眼睛就肿。以前在鞍山刷云母粉，工人们也是经常弄得脸疼眼肿。那时他们没有说什么。可是，现在——他们变了！王成明说：“建立工厂就应该有个工厂的样儿……”不久，他跟大伙儿一块研究出一种清扫机，代替人工刷刷子。
    每一天，都有人在提合理化建议。今天一个流动锅，明天一个屋面卷材联合铺材机，后天又是一个样……
    我问史文礼：“怎么你们来到包头，一个一个都变了？”
    他笑着说：“还能背着‘落后’的名儿坐火车，一直坐在包头来吗？这次我们在鞍山上火车，有多少人欢送我们！首长们一个一个的跟我们握手。说：‘包头工业基地今年的任务大得很，你们一人要顶三个用！’‘你们到了包头工业基地，要新建一个玛?脂预制厂。这个工厂没有个现存样儿，究竟是个什么样儿，由你们自己去创造。’‘新到一个地方，新建一个工厂，困难一定是很多的。可是，我相信你们，越困难越出先进经验！我们在这儿等待你们的好消息。’我们听了这些话，当时兴奋的呀，连夜就在火车上开了个出发誓师大会。”
    停了一会，史文礼脸上不笑了，变成一付严肃的样儿，又说：
    “过去我们常常说，解放之后，工人翻身作了主人。实际上，我们做了自己工厂的主人，是不是就做了自己工作的主人呢？那倒不一定！就拿我们说吧，以前我们在露天熬玛?脂，常常作不了自己工作的主。刮风了，下雨了，屋面潮了，天气冷了，立刻就要停工。我们干了今天，不知明天要干什么。我们上午熬了玛?脂，不知下午会不会被调去抬砖头。常常干得大家都是有气无力的。可是，现在，我们要建立玛?脂预制厂了，我们要让我们的工作由我们自己来支配，不受自然条件的影响！这个工厂能不能够建立起来，建立起来是个什么样子，能不能够早天投入生产，也完全由我们自己来决定。我们已经做了我们工作的主人，自自然然我们要用主人翁的态度来对待自己的工作了！”
      （注）油毛毡从工厂一捆一捆运出来的时候，怕它们遇热粘在一起，就在上面涂上一层云母粉。油毛毡运到了，就要把云母粉刷掉。
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（未完）
