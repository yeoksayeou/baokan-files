The audience numbered approximately 1,900 people.

The Chinese Art Troupe gave its second performance on September 1st, which was attended by the President of the Uruguayan Council of State, Alberto Zubiría. That evening, Alberto Zubiría received the head of the Chinese Art Troupe, Chu Tunan, the deputy heads, Zhao Feng and Wang Li.

The audience gave the Chinese Art Troupe's performance high praise. They said, "The performance is so good, so wonderful," it is "a spectacle Uruguayans have never seen before," and "we feel as if we have discovered a new world of theater."

The "El Diario," a newspaper with considerable circulation, said on September 1st that the response to the performance was so good not only because we rarely see it and feel fresh about it, but more importantly because of its beauty.

The Red Party's official newspaper, "El Acción," said that Chinese classical drama can be appreciated by anyone. Westerners do not understand Chinese, but can understand Chinese drama well through its wonderful performance movements and stunts.

    我艺术团在蒙得维的亚演出
    乌拉圭国务会议主席接见艺术团领导人
    新华社3日讯　蒙得维的亚消息：中国艺术团8月31日在蒙得维的亚索德雷国家剧院举行了首次演出，受到观众热烈欢迎。出席观看演出的有：红徽党的领导人、前国务会议主席巴特耶—柏莱斯、教育部部长克累门特—鲁希亚、广播事业局（它管理着几个全国性的文化机构）局长马腊里塔—格腊西亚、乌拉圭许多著名社会人士和文化人士以及外交使节们。所有观众大约有一千九百人。
    中国艺术团在9月1日作第二次演出，乌拉圭国务会议主席艾伯托—苏比里亚出席观看了演出。当天晚上，艾伯托—苏比里亚接见了中国艺术团团长楚图南、副团长赵沨和王力。
    观众们对中国艺术团的演出给予很高的评价。他们说，“演出是这样好，这样美妙”，这是“乌拉圭人从来没有见过的奇观”，“我们觉得简直像发现了一个新的舞台世界”。
    一家销路相当广的报纸“日报”在9月1日说，演出反应这样的好，这不仅仅是因为我们很少见到而对它感到新鲜，更重要的是因为它的优美。
    红徽党的机关报“行动报”说，中国的古典戏剧任何人都能够欣赏。西方人不懂中国话，但是可以通过它的绝妙的表演动作和绝技很好地了解中国的戏剧。
