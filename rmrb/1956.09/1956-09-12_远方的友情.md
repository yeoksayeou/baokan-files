    Friendship from Afar
  　Xiao Guang
                First Arrival in Santiago
    On the afternoon of August 16th, the special plane carrying the Chinese Folk Art Troupe landed at Santiago Airport. This was the final stop of the art troupe's 22,000-kilometer aerial journey from Beijing, and also the first city in Latin America where we would perform. Everyone couldn't help but cheer with excitement.
    Hospitable Chileans had been waiting at the airport since early morning. They presented bouquets of flowers to their Chinese friends from afar and constantly greeted them in Beijing dialect: "Ni hao (Hello)." Chilean Senators and members of the House of Representatives Allende, Trigo, Martini Campos, and Lello Raffaelli repeatedly welcomed the arrival of the Chinese art troupe to head of the troupe, Chu Tunan. Renowned poet Neruda, Director of the Drama Department of the University of Chile Oteaza, Director of the Experimental Theater Bara, famous painter Venturini, famous director Leo, and many other well-known figures in Chilean music, drama, and dance warmly shook hands with everyone. Overseas Chinese who had lived abroad for generations also brought their children to meet relatives from their motherland. Many overseas Chinese living in northern Chile made a special trip by plane to Santiago to welcome the art troupe. Spanish, French, English, and Cantonese all became tools for exchanging friendship and homesickness.
    Here, Mrs. Venturini, who had taught at the Beijing Foreign Languages Institute for more than a year, discovered her student among the art troupe's translators. They hugged, kissed, and their eyes were filled with tears of excitement. Chilean writers, doctors, and artists who had visited China asked about every acquaintance in China.
    Like all countries in the Southern Hemisphere, Chile is currently in winter (June, July, and August are winter months), but guests from Beijing in the midst of summer heat did not feel cold at all. The warm friendship of the Chileans was like a warm current, impacting our hearts. Chilean friends said: "The Chilean climate is also welcoming you. This year's spring has come earlier than any other year with the arrival of the Chinese art troupe."
             “Bueno, Chinese Art Troupe”
    The performance of the Chinese Art Troupe became a major event in Santiago. The program was staged at the Municipal Theater, which can accommodate more than 1,500 spectators. Although the highest ticket price reached 4,000 pesos (approximately 16-17 yuan), all tickets were sold out two days before the premiere. A Chilean official who only bought two tickets complained to us: he was in a dilemma, not knowing whether to choose his wife or daughter to watch the play with him.
    On August 20th, at the first public performance, Chilean President Ibáñez, ministers, and ambassadors from various countries to Chile came to watch the play. President Ibáñez received the leaders of the art troupe that day and said: "I am very grateful for your performance. I and my people like to watch your plays. You have finally brought good things." Minister of Education Vidal thanked "the art envoys from Beijing" for giving him an "unforgettable night."
    Newspapers published a large number of pictures, news, and articles about the art troupe every day. "The Horn Newspaper" believed that "the perfect and amazing performance of the Chinese Art Troupe is a precious gift of supreme value that China has given to the Chilean stage." "Last News" wrote: "There are two ways to understand China: traveling and not traveling. The Chilean people are very grateful to the Chinese Art Troupe for providing us with such a valuable opportunity—we can understand China without traveling, just by going to the theater."
    On the streets, trams, and in shops, people could be heard enthusiastically talking about "Bueno (good), Monkey King Sun Wukong," "Bueno, Red Silk Dance." What surprised and moved them the most was that the Chinese actresses could sing the Chilean folk song "Red Copihue" (the national flower of Chile) so "authentically"!
     "Free World Newspaper" said: "The Chinese are lucky, they are welcomed everywhere." This is indeed the case. The Chilean people repaid the performance of the Chinese Art Troupe with boundless enthusiasm.
    Mr. Durham, Speaker of the Chilean House of Representatives, personally hosted the art troupe to visit the Capitol Building and presented us with the most precious gift—a Chilean flag with a silver base.
    Enthusiastic Chilean youths often unexpectedly surrounded Chinese guests, asking for autographs as souvenirs. Many people saw these "strange square characters" for the first time. They carefully cut and pasted the inscription given by Chu Tunan, the head of the troupe, to Chilean newspapers in their notebooks. Chilean old men and women called our actors "Chinitas" (Chinese children nicknames). When they met, they would be affectionate for a long time, saying repeatedly: "I like you so much, Chinitas!"
    Every night after the performance, the audience stayed at the theater entrance for a long time, waiting to greet the actors. Some people kept gesturing, saying, "I really want to give you my heart!" Once, a little boy secretly stuffed his beloved clay doll into the hands of our pianist, insisting that she accept it. A young Chilean female painter, Olia, ran to the theater for several days in a row to draw portraits and sketches of the actors. She said: "These energetic faces are so lovely, I want to faithfully record them on the painting board so that more Chileans can see you."
    Chilean artists enthusiastically introduced Chilean music, drama, and dance to the art troupe... This allowed us to appreciate the famous Chilean ballet "The Green Table" and "Araucanía", the drama "The Mayor of Zalamea", the symphony orchestra's performance, and the "Cueca" folk dance, which is very popular among the people, during our short stay in Santiago. They were very willing to solicit the opinions of their Chinese counterparts, saying it was a "spiritual exchange."
    In the hotel where the art troupe stayed, visitors came in an endless stream every day. Some brought a painting of the cityscape of Santiago they had drawn themselves, and some presented Chilean pottery; others came from afar in the suburbs, just to tell us how much the Chilean people liked the play "Autumn River," and that there were many lovable characters like the old boatman in Chile. Name cards requesting meetings and invitations to be guests flew in like snowflakes every day.
    A Chilean friend once talked about why Chile and China, separated by thousands of mountains and rivers, felt so close to each other. We told them with an old Chinese saying: "A bosom friend afar brings a distant land near." The Chilean friend applauded. Faced with countless moving facts every day, we felt the sincerity of these words more deeply at this moment and in this place.

    远方的友情
  　萧光
                初抵圣地亚哥
    8月16日下午，中国民间艺术团乘坐的专机在圣地亚哥机场降落。这是艺术团从北京出发以来二万二千公里空中旅行的最末一站，也是我们在拉丁美洲进行访问演出的第一座城市。大家禁不住兴奋得欢呼起来。
    热情好客的智利人，从清早起就在机场等候。他们向来自远方的中国朋友捧上一束又一束的鲜花，并且不断用北京话问候：“你好”。智利参、众两院的议员阿伦德、特里高脱、马蒂尼·坎普司和莱约·拉发耶等一再对楚图南团长表示欢迎中国艺术团的来临。著名诗人聂鲁达，智利大学戏剧系主任奥特亚司，实验剧院院长巴拉，著名画家万徒勒里，著名导演李欧以及智利音乐、戏剧、舞蹈界的许多知名人士和大家亲切握手。世代侨居海外的华侨也携儿带女地前来会见祖国来的亲人，许多住在智利北部的华侨特地乘飞机赶来圣地亚哥迎接艺术团。西班牙文、法文、英文、广东话一时都成了相互交流友谊和乡情的工具。
    这里，曾在北京外国语学院执教一年多的万徒勒里夫人，在艺术团的译员中间发现了自己的学生。她们拥抱、亲吻，激动得泪水充满了眼眶。访问过中国的智利作家、医生和艺术家们问起在中国的每一位相识。
    和南半球所有的国家一样，智利现在正是冬天（每年六、七、八三个月是冬天），但是来自盛暑中的北京客人丝毫不觉得冷。智利人的热烈友谊像一股股暖流，冲激着我们的心。智利的朋友都说：“智利的气候也在欢迎你们。今年的春天随着中国艺术团的到达，比哪年来得都早”。
             “布爱诺，中国艺术团”
    中国艺术团的演出成为圣地亚哥的一件大事。节目在可以容纳一千五百多观众的市立剧院上演，虽然最高的票价达到四千比索（约合人民币十六、七元）一张，票子在公演前两天已经全部出售一空。一位只买到了两张戏票的智利官员向我们诉苦：他很为难，不知道在妻子和女儿中间选择哪一个一同看戏好。
    8月20日第一场公演，智利总统伊巴涅斯、部长们和各国驻智利使节都来看戏。伊巴涅斯总统当天接见了艺术团的领导人，他说：“非常感激你们的演出，我和我的人民都喜欢看你们的戏，你们终于把好东西带来了。”教育部长维达尔感谢“北京的艺术使节们”给了他一个“永远难忘的夜晚”。
    报纸每天以大量篇幅刊载有关艺术团的图片、消息和文章。“号角报”认为“中国艺术团完美到惊人程度的演出是中国送给智利舞台的具有无上价值的宝贵礼物”。“最后消息报”写道：“了解中国的方法有两种：旅行和不旅行。智利人十分感谢中国艺术团为我们提供了如此难能可贵的机会——可以不用旅行，只上剧场就能了解中国”。
    在大街小巷，电车上和商店里，到处可以听到人们热烈地谈论“布爱诺（好），猴王孙悟空”，“布爱诺，红绸子舞”。而最使他们惊奇和感动的是中国的女演员竟能把智利民歌“红色的高匹爱”（智利国花）唱得那么“够味”！
     “自由世界报”说：“中国人是幸运的，他们处处受到欢迎”。事实也正是这样，智利人以无限热情答谢中国艺术团的演出。
    智利众议院议长杜拉姆先生亲自招待艺术团参观国会大厦，并且送给我们一件最高贵的礼物——一面带有银座的智利国旗。
    热情的智利青年时常出其不意地包围住中国客人，要求签名留念。许多人还是第一次看见这种“奇怪的方块字”。他们把楚图南团长给智利报刊的题辞仔细地剪贴在自己的小本子上。智利的老先生和老太太管我们的演员叫“乞尼达”（中国孩子昵称），见了面总要亲热半天，连连说：“多喜欢你呀，乞尼达！”
    每晚散场以后，观众久久地守在剧院门口，等着向演员们致意。有人不断地做着手势说，“真愿意把心都掏给你们”！曾经有一个小男孩把自己心爱的泥娃娃悄悄地塞在我们钢琴家的手里，一定要她收下。年轻的智利女画家奥丽雅接连几天跑来剧院为演员们画像和速写。她说：“这些生气勃勃的面孔实在太可爱了，我要忠实地记在画版上，让更多的智利人看到你们”。
    智利的艺术家热心地为艺术团介绍智利的音乐、戏剧、舞蹈……。这使我们在圣地亚哥逗留的短短期间，能够欣赏了智利著名的芭蕾舞剧“绿桌子”和“阿劳蒂亚”、话剧“萨来梅亚的村长”、交响乐队的演奏以及在民间十分流行的“圭加”土风舞。他们非常乐意征求中国同行的意见，说它是一种“心灵上的交流”。
    在艺术团所住的旅馆里，来访者每天络绎不绝，有的带来一张自己画的圣地亚哥市景，有的送上智利土产的陶器；还有的老远从市郊跑来，只为了告诉我们：智利人多么喜欢“秋江”这出戏，像老艄公这种可爱的性格，智利也有的是。要求会见的名片和邀去作客的请柬，每天像雪片似的飞来。
    曾有智利朋友谈起，智利和中国相隔千山万水，何以彼此竟感到如此亲近。我们以中国的一句古话相告：“海内存知己，天涯若比邻”。智利朋友拍手叫绝。每天面对着无数感人的事实的我们，此时此地也更感到这话的真切。　8月25日　圣地亚哥（附图片）
