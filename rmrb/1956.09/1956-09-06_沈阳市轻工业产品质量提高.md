    Shenyang (this newspaper reports) Since the second quarter of this year, the quality of products from local state-owned light industrial factories in Shenyang has significantly improved. Among the fourteen categories and twenty-four types of main products controlled by the Second Industry Bureau, ten categories and seventeen types of products, including enamelware, rubber shoes, book and magazine printing, basketballs and volleyballs, leather shoes, woodwork, and V-belts, have seen significant improvements in quality compared to the first quarter. The various rubber shoes produced by the three joint state-private rubber shoe factories have exceeded the national standards in terms of both qualification rates and physical properties. The basketballs and volleyballs produced by the local state-owned Shenyang Cultural and Educational Supplies Factory used to deform after use. Since learning advanced methods from the Shanghai Jianshe Ball Factory, such as material selection and segmenting, gluing the inner lining, pressing the sheets, using rosin wax to sew, and machine punching, the factory has solved the key quality problems of cold cone leakage and uneven stitch size, ensuring roundness. The retread glue produced by the No. 2 Regenerated Rubber Factory used to be not wear-resistant, and tires retreaded with it would be scrapped before running 10,000 kilometers. Now, its wear resistance has reached the quality level of the best domestic Hongqi brand, and retreaded tires can run more than 20,000 kilometers. After learning advanced experiences from Shanghai, Beijing, and other places, the local state-owned Shenyang Shoe Factory has created novel and beautiful leather shoe styles with sturdy uppers and soles. It was ranked first at the leather shoe exhibition of eight local state-owned shoe factories in Liaoning Province.
    The improvement in the quality of light industrial products is mainly due to the fact that the factories under the Shenyang Second Industry Bureau have attached importance to learning and promoting advanced experiences from top to bottom in the inter-factory competition, and have taken measures such as strengthening technical management. According to incomplete statistics from fifty-nine factories, a total of one hundred and forty-seven advanced experiences and new technologies related to improving product quality were promoted and adopted in the first half of the year. Among them, in addition to some being learned from the Soviet Union and domestic cities such as Shanghai, most were created and summarized by the factories in carrying out the advanced producer movement.

    沈阳市轻工业产品质量提高
    本报讯　今年第二季度以来，沈阳市地方国营轻工业工厂的产品质量有了显著提高。第二工业局控制的十四类二十四种主要产品中，就有搪瓷、胶鞋、书刊印刷、篮排球、皮鞋、木器、三角机带等十类十七种产品质量比第一季度有了显著的改进。三个公私合营胶鞋厂生产的各种胶鞋，合格率和物理性能都超过了国家规定标准。地方国营沈阳市文教用品厂生产的篮排球，过去使用后就走形，自从学习上海建设球厂的选料截片法、沾里布压片法、松香腊打线、机器扎眼等先进方法以后，解决了冷锥漏线，针码不匀的质量关键问题，保证了圆度正圆。再生胶二厂生产的补胎胶，过去不耐磨，用它补好的汽车轮胎，跑不上一万公里，就得报废，现在耐磨力已经达到国内最好的红旗牌的质量水平，补好的胎，可以跑二万公里以上。地方国营沈阳市制鞋厂学习上海、北京等地的先进经验以后，皮鞋式样新颖、美观，帮底坚固，在辽宁省八个地方国营制鞋厂的皮鞋展览会上，被评为第一位。
    轻工业产品质量提高，主要是沈阳市第二工业局所属各厂在厂际竞赛中，从上而下重视了学习和推广先进经验，并采取了加强技术管理等措施。据五十九个工厂的不完全统计，上半年共推广和采用了一百四十七种有关提高产品质量方面的先进经验和新技术。其中除部分是学习苏联和国内上海等地的以外，大部分都是各厂在开展先进生产者运动中创造和总结出来的。
