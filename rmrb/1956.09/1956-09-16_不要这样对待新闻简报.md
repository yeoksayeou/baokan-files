    From the Readers

    Don't Treat Newsreels Like This
    Currently, a situation has emerged: some cinemas, when showing newsreels, firstly, do not completely darken the theater; and secondly, a significant portion of the audience has not yet entered. In the dim light and noisy environment, the audience naturally cannot see the screen clearly or hear the narration!
    Why do cinemas show newsreels under these circumstances? It is understood that they regard showing newsreels as an extra burden, believing that it takes up time and does not increase revenue. Showing newsreels is merely complying with the regulations from higher authorities, so it is no wonder that newsreels are treated as "special advertisements," handled in the same way as general advertising slides. At the same time, some individual cinemas even dare to violate the regulations from higher authorities and do not show newsreels at all. A certain cinema in Sichuan, in addition to not showing them, even posted a notice stating, in essence: This cinema does not show newsreels; please enter the theater on time. The implication is that it is acceptable to be late if newsreels are being shown.
    Newsreels promptly report major events happening domestically and enrich the audience's knowledge in various aspects. The audience enjoys watching newsreels. It is hoped that cinemas will not treat newsreels like this.

### 不要这样对待新闻简报

    不要这样对待新闻简报
    目前，出现了这么一种情况：有些电影院在放映新闻简报的时候，第一，场内不全灭灯；第二，还有相当一部分观众尚未入场。而在光线模糊，人声喧杂之中，观众当然也就看不清银幕，听不清解说词了！
    为什么电影院要在这种情况下放映新闻简报呢？据了解，原来他们把放映新闻简报视为一种额外负担，认为它既占时间又不能增加收入。放映新闻简报只不过是遵守上级规定而已，这就难怪新闻简报被当作“特殊广告”，同一般广告幻灯片一样处理了。同时也有个别电影院居然敢于违反上级规定而不放映新闻简报。四川某一电影院在不映之余还出了一个布告，大意是：本院不映新闻简报，请观众准时入场。言外之意，放映新闻简报就可以迟到了。
    新闻简报及时地报道了国内发生的重大事情，丰富了观众各方面的知识，观众是喜欢看新闻简报的。希望电影院不要这样对待新闻简报。
