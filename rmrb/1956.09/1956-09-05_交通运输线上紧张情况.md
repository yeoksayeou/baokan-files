Xinhua News Agency, September 4th: Xinhua News Agency reporters Li Feng and Lin Yin report: Recently, an unusually tense situation has emerged on the transportation front in some areas of the country, and it has begun to affect industrial and agricultural production and the lives of the people in these areas.

　　Since mid-August, the number of railway passengers nationwide has suddenly increased dramatically, with more than 130,000 more passengers traveling by train each day compared to early August. The Beijing Railway Station used to have a maximum of 28,000 passengers boarding and alighting daily last year, but now it reaches about 60,000 people per day. This situation is unprecedented in previous years, even during the Spring Festival. In order to meet the needs of passengers, the Ministry of Railways added 995 temporary passenger trains nationwide in August; more than 40 temporary passenger trains were also added on the Baoji-Lanzhou section of the railway in August. However, this still cannot meet the needs of passengers. Currently, on the Longhai Railway, east of Zhengzhou to Lanzhou, many people along the line cannot buy tickets to Lanzhou. Many passengers who want to go to Sichuan by bus or train (not yet in operation) from Baoji are delayed in Baoji because they cannot buy tickets. Passengers traveling along the Yangtze River to Chongqing are also very crowded. It is said that each hotel in Hankou can only get two or three boat tickets per day; more than 2,000 passengers traveling westward from Hankou or the lower reaches of the Yangtze River are often stuck in hotels because they cannot buy boat tickets. A small number of passengers have experienced financial difficulties and their lives have been affected due to prolonged delays at intermediate stations and port hotels. Large cities such as Xi'an, Changchun, and Dalian are also more crowded than in the past, and train tickets are also very difficult to obtain.

　　Freight transport on some key transportation lines is also very tight. As of the end of August, over 10,000 tons of goods destined for Sichuan via Shaanxi, just from the Ministry of Commerce, were stockpiled in Baoji and could not be transported. Industrial products such as steel, machinery, petroleum, and chemical raw materials shipped upstream along the Yangtze River are also heavily stockpiled in Hankou. In addition to these goods stockpiled mid-way awaiting transport, the Ministry of Commerce also has tens of thousands of tons of goods for the people of Sichuan to be transported from Baoji and Hankou to Sichuan in September. Therefore, the transportation capacity is even more insufficient. Industrial products and building materials shipped from some large cities to the Northwest cannot be shipped due to overly busy transportation. On the railway line from Zhengzhou to Lanzhou, a large number of materials are being transported to the Northwest, and there are too many trains coming and going, causing more than 1,000 vehicles loaded with materials to be blocked at various stations along the line. Tens of thousands of tons of drilling equipment, steel, cement, timber, and general merchandise supporting the exploration of Karamay and the Qaidam Basin are also delayed en route. The Jinjiang-Mawei railway was restored according to pre-liberation standards, and the quality of the lines and large buildings is extremely poor, and the transportation capacity is weak, resulting in the accumulation of goods destined for Yunnan and Guizhou in Jinjiang and other places.

　　Because large quantities of materials cannot be transported to the supplied areas according to plan, the lives and production of some people in these areas have been affected. Cotton cloth is out of stock in Sichuan Province, and more than 2,000 types of general merchandise and knitwear are out of stock; some commercial grassroots units in the Xichang area have suspended business due to severe shortages of goods; petroleum shortages once caused the suspension of automobile transportation from Chengdu to Ya'an; more than 200 automobiles and more than 7,000 handcarts in Sichuan Province have been out of service due to the inability to purchase accessories. Medicines have been out of stock in the Gansu Province market for more than a month, and the supply of basic construction materials and flour is also tight. Some areas in Henan, Hebei, Shandong, and Anhui are also experiencing shortages of civilian coal due to transportation difficulties caused by floods.

　　This tense transportation situation occurred during the off-season months of July and August, so if measures are not taken quickly, the tense situation may worsen.

    交通运输线上紧张情况
    新华社4日讯　新华社记者李峰、林印报道：最近国内有些地区交通运输战线上出现了异常紧张的情况，并且已经开始影响到这些地区的工、农业生产和人民的生活。
    从8月中旬到现在，全国乘火车的旅客，突然大量增加，每天乘火车的旅客，比8月上旬增加了十三万多人。北京车站每天上下旅客去年最多只有二万八千人，而现在每天达到六万人左右。这种情况，是在历年同期间甚至春节期间所没有过的。铁道部为了满足旅客的需要，8月份在全国增开了九百九十五列临时客车；宝鸡到兰州这段铁路，8月份也增开了四十多列临时客车。但是仍然不能满足旅客的需要。现在在陇海路上，从郑州到兰州以东，沿线有很多人买不到去兰州的车票。许多想由宝鸡乘汽车或火车（未营业）去四川的旅客，因为买不到票耽搁在宝鸡。沿川江到重庆的旅客，也十分拥挤。据说汉口每个旅馆一天只能分到两三张船票；由汉口或长江下游西上的旅客，经常有两千多人因为买不到船票而停留在旅馆里。少数旅客因为长久耽搁在中途车站和港口旅馆，旅费已经发生困难，生活受到影响。西安、长春、大连等大城市，旅客也比过去拥挤，火车票也很难买得到。
    有些交通干线的货运，同样很紧张。经陕西运往四川的物资，到8月底为止，只是商业部就有一万多吨积压在宝鸡不能运走。沿川江上运的钢铁、机器、石油、化工原料等工业品，也大量地积压在汉口。除了这些中途积压待运的物资以外，9月份商业部还有几万吨供应四川人民用的物资，要从宝鸡和汉口运往四川。因此，运输力量更加感到不足。有些大城市运往西北的工业品和建筑材料，也因为运输过于繁忙而不能启运。从郑州到兰州的铁路线上，因为有大量的物资运向西北，来往的列车太多，致使一千多辆装满物资的车辆不能通过，被堵塞在沿线各个车站。各地支援克拉玛依和柴达木盆地的钻探器材、钢材、水泥、木材、百货，共有几万吨也耽搁在中途。金城江到麻尾的铁路是按解放以前的标准恢复的，线路及大型建筑质量异常低劣，运输能力薄弱，以致在金城江等地积压了运往云南和贵州的物资。
    由于大量的物资不能按计划运到被供应的地区，这些地区部分人民的生活和生产已经受到影响。四川省的棉布已经脱销，百货和针织品脱销的已经有两千多种；西昌地区有些商业基层单位，因为商品严重脱销而停止了营业；石油脱销曾经使成都到雅安的汽车运输一度停顿；四川省有两百多辆汽车和七千多辆架子车因为买不到配件而停驶。甘肃省市场上的医药已经脱销了一个多月，基本建设材料、面粉等供应也显得紧张。河南、河北、山东、安徽的某些地区也因为水灾招致的运输困难，使民用煤供应不足。
    这种交通运输紧张的情况，还是在运输淡季的七、八月发生的，因此，如果不迅速采取措施，紧张的情况可能还会加剧。
