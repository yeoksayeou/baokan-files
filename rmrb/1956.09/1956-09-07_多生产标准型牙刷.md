    Produce More Standard Toothbrushes
    Our dentist introduced us to a standard toothbrush with twelve tufts of bristles. They said that using this type of toothbrush is the most hygienic. However, when we went to the streets, we saw that the stores were selling toothbrushes with very dense bristles. Later, although we found some standard ones, the quality was not good. Standard toothbrushes use much less raw material than older-style toothbrushes; they are both hygienic and economical. We hope that the relevant departments will produce more standard toothbrushes and vigorously promote them.

    多生产标准型牙刷
    牙科医生向我们介绍了一种标准型的牙刷，每把十二株毛。他们说，用这种牙刷最卫生。可是，我们到街上一看，店里卖的都是毛很密的牙刷，后来虽说找到了几个标准型的，质量却不好。标准型牙刷比旧型牙刷所用的原料少得多；既合卫生，又能节约。希望有关部门多多生产标准型牙刷，并且大力宣传推广。
