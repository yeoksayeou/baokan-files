Xinhua News Agency, September 29th, New York Dispatch: It is announced that the United Nations Security Council meeting will begin substantive debate on the Suez Canal issue on October 5th.

Reports indicate that the foreign ministers of the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and Egypt will attend the discussions.

Xinhua News Agency, September 29th: According to a report from the Yugoslav News Agency: On the 28th, the Yugoslav State Secretary for Foreign Affairs, Popović, left Belgrade by plane for New York to attend the Security Council meeting.

Before boarding, Popović told Yugoslav journalists that he believed the Security Council would be able to find a way to reach an agreement on resolving the Suez issue. Popović emphasized: "All objective conditions for achieving this are in place, and it is hoped that subjective conditions can also be created."

Popović said that the Yugoslav delegation in the Security Council would very actively support all proposals and initiatives put forward for the peaceful resolution of this issue. Now it is necessary to overcome the disturbing situation through sincerity and a willingness to negotiate and understand. I believe that the representatives of those countries directly involved in this dispute will also be willing to take action in this direction.
