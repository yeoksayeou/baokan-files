Payment According to Labor
Fang Jie

Chinese intellectuals have traditionally been reluctant to openly discuss "profit," which can be considered a kind of "tradition." This "tradition" still has some influence, but the situation is ultimately different. When acquainted writers meet to discuss writing, they often touch upon the principle of "payment according to labor."

When discussing "payment according to labor," we must address certain unreasonable remuneration practices, such as royalties for translated works. Some translators, who are knowledgeable, capable, experienced, and conscientious, truly scrutinize every word and phrase of their translations, revising and polishing them meticulously, without neglecting even a single punctuation mark. The quality of such works naturally surpasses the average level, yet their royalties are similar to, or even the same as, those of some poorly crafted translations. If the former is a "niche" work, while the latter is a "popular" one, then the actual income of the two translators can differ greatly. This violates the principle of "payment according to labor."

This situation not only lets down some diligent translators but also hinders the cultivation of a positive atmosphere in the translation field and the improvement of overall translation quality. Serious translators will certainly not lower the quality of their translations due to unreasonable royalties, but who can guarantee that there are no translators who are "only after profit"? This practice is a bucket of cold water for the former, but encouragement for the latter!

I do not know what the comrades who approve royalties are actually thinking when they write, nor do I want to unfairly label them with terms like "business-minded." I only hope that these comrades who "wield great power" will calmly consider whether they are paying too much attention to whether a translation is "niche" or "popular," and neglecting the quality of the translation and the "labor" of the translator.

"Niche" and "popular" works each have their own merits. From any perspective, we need excellent "popular" works that reflect modern life, and we also need outstanding "niche" works (classical works) that have been tempered and can stand the test of time. The key lies in the quality of the translation, in the "ability" and "labor" of the translator. Shouldn't "niche" translations that require more effort, are of higher quality, but have smaller sales volume at the moment be given higher royalties?

Naturally, it is more troublesome to implement the principle of "payment according to labor" here. The quality of a work cannot be weighed, measured, or tested with any precision instrument. No one should expect to achieve 100% accuracy, but obviously unreasonable phenomena should always be eliminated. We are, after all, living in a new society of "payment according to labor"!

    按劳取酬
    方介
    中国文人向来是不大公然谈“利”的，这也算是一种“传统”。这“传统”至今还有影响，但情况到底不同了。相识的文人们碰在一起谈文的时候，也往往谈到“按劳取酬”的原则了。
    谈起“按劳取酬”，就要接触到某种不合理的稿酬，例如翻译作品的稿酬。有些有学识、有能力、有经验而又认真负责的翻译家，对于自己的译品，真是字斟句酌，推敲而又推敲，修改而又修改，连一个标点都不放松。这样译品的质量自然在一般水平之上，可是稿酬呢，却跟某些粗制滥造的译品相差无几，甚至完全相等。如果前者是“冷门”，而后者是“热货”的话，那么，双方译者的实际收入就有天壤之差了。这就违反了“按劳取酬”的原则。
    这种情况不但有负于某些勤恳的译者，而且不利于翻译界良好风气的培养和一般翻译水平的提高。严肃的译者固然不会因稿酬不合理而降低自己译品的质量，但谁能保证没有“唯利是图”的译者呢？这种作法对于前者是冷水，而对于后者却是鼓励！
    我不知道批稿费的同志们在下笔时的实际想法如何，也不想用“生意眼”一类的帽子硬扣在他们头上。我只希望这些“大权在握”的同志们平心静气地想一想：是不是过多地注意译品的“冷”和“热”，而忽视译品的质量和译者的“劳”呢？
     “冷门”和“热货”各有千秋。不管从哪一方面说，我们需要反映现代生活的优秀的“热货”，也需要千捶百炼、经得起时间考验的杰出的“冷门”（古典作品），关键在于译品的质量，在于译者的“能”和“劳”。对于费力多、质量高，而一时销数又不大的“冷门”译品，难道不应该给以较高的稿酬吗？
    自然，要在这里贯彻“按劳取酬”的原则，那是比较麻烦的。作品的质量不能用秤称，不能用尺量，也不能用任何精密仪器来检验。谁也不应该要求做到百分之百的准确，但显然太不合理的现象总是应该消除的。我们毕竟生活在“按劳取酬”的新社会里！
