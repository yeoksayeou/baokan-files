    Protest Against the Illegal Verdict of the West German Federal Constitutional Court
    Shen Junru, Wu Defeng, Zhang Zhizhang, Mei Ru'ao, Qian Duansheng
    Under the pressure of the Adenauer government, the West German Federal Constitutional Court finally declared the German Communist Party illegal, and immediately arrested a large number of German Communist Party leaders and cadres. Chinese legal workers felt extremely indignant after hearing this news. We express our strong protest against this barbaric act of persecution!
    The German Communist Party has always been a loyal defender of the democratic rights and national interests of Germany. Its efforts to safeguard the people's democratic freedoms and rights that should be guaranteed by the Federal Constitution, and to demand the establishment of an independent, unified, democratic, and peace-loving Germany, are entirely in line with the interests of the German people and all peace-loving people in the world. The German Communist Party should be fully protected by the Federal Constitution.
    However, the Federal Constitutional Court, following the will of the Adenauer government instigated by US imperialism, in order to further promote militarization, push Germany onto the path of revanchist war, and further persecute all peace and democratic forces, has imposed unwarranted charges on the German Communist Party and made a slanderous verdict. This is a repeat of the Reichstag fire of 1933. This is a verdict that distorts facts and reverses black and white. This is an illegal verdict in which the Federal Constitutional Court blatantly tramples on the constitutional rights of the German people and blatantly violates the Potsdam Agreement's provisions for guaranteeing all democratic parties and democratic order in Germany. This action hinders the peaceful reunification of Germany and endangers the national survival of Germany. This action is a serious provocation to the German people and the people of the world who advocate peace and democracy!
    We Chinese legal workers, in order to safeguard human justice, solemnly condemn this verdict and fully support the German people's protests and struggles against the banning of the German Communist Party. Like all honest legal workers in the world, we firmly maintain that: The illegal verdict banning the German Communist Party must be revoked! The constitutional rights of the German Communist Party must be restored!

    抗议西德联邦宪法法院的非法判决
    沈钧儒、吴德峰、张志让、梅汝璈、钱端升
    西德联邦宪法法院在阿登纳政府的压力下，终于宣布德国共产党为非法，并随即拘捕了大批的德国共产党领袖和干部，中国法律工作者听到这个消息后，感到无比的愤慨。我们对于这一蛮横的迫害行为，表示强烈的抗议！
    德国共产党一向是德国民主权利和民族利益的忠诚捍卫者。它一向为维护联邦宪法所应保障的人民的民主、自由、权利，为要求建立独立、统一、民主和爱好和平的德国所作的努力，是完全符合德国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民的利益的。德国共产党理应受到联邦宪法的充分保护。
    但联邦宪法法院竟然遵照美帝国主义指使的阿登纳政府的意志，为了进一步推行军国主义化，把德国推上复仇主义的战争道路，进一步迫害一切和平民主力量，对德国共产党强加上莫须有的罪名，作出了诬陷性的判决。这是1933年国会纵火案故技的重演。这是歪曲事实、颠倒黑白的判决。这是联邦宪法法院公然践踏德国人民的宪法权利，公然违反波茨坦协定所规定的保障德国一切民主政党和民主秩序的非法判决。这种行动阻挠着德国的和平统一，危害着德国的民族生存。这种行动是对主张和平民主的德国人民和全世界人民的严重挑衅！
    我们中国法律工作者为了维护人类正义，严正斥责这个判决，全力支持德国人民反对禁止德国共产党的抗议和斗争。我们同全世界一切正直的法律工作者一样，坚决主张：禁止德国共产党的非法判决必须撤销！德国共产党的宪法权利必须恢复！
