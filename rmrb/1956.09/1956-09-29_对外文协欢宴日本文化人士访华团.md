Xinhua News Agency, 28th. The Japanese Cultural Figures Delegation to China, invited to visit China, attended a welcome banquet held by the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries (ACFC) tonight.

Yang Hansheng, Vice President of the ACFC, presided over the welcome banquet and delivered a speech. He said: When welcoming the Chinese Peking Opera Delegation to Japan, Japanese friends mentioned "a near neighbor is better than a distant relative." Today, when welcoming Japanese friends, we would like to say that China and Japan are not only close neighbors, but also old relatives. Yang Hansheng said that there are many aspects of Japanese culture worth learning from. The delegation visiting China this time are all well-known figures in Japanese literary and art circles, and he is confident that they will make beneficial contributions to cultural exchange between China and Japan.

Naotake Tanabe, the head of the Japanese Cultural Figures Delegation, then spoke. He said that they had felt the tremendous development of New China, and they were willing to take this feeling back as a rare gift and devote themselves to the development of cultural exchange between Japan and China.

Among those present tonight were literary and art figures Tian Han, Ouyang Yuqian, Cao Yu, Zhao Shuli, Ai Qing, Kang Zhuo, Wu Zuoren, Hua Junwu, and Xu Guangping, the head of the Chinese delegation that recently went to Japan to attend the Second World Conference against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, and many others.
