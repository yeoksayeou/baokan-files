Xinhua News Agency, September 4th: Cotton in most cotton fields across the country has begun to bloom and fluff. Shaanxi, Shandong, Shanxi, Henan, Xinjiang, Jiangxi and other regions have already started picking new cotton.

According to Xinhua News Agency reporters learning from the Ministry of Agriculture, except for cotton-growing areas in Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Hebei and other provinces, which have suffered varying degrees of reduced production due to typhoons and floods, cotton growth in other cotton-producing provinces and regions such as Hubei, Shandong, Shaanxi, Jiangxi, Shanxi, Gansu, Xinjiang, and Sichuan is very good, and all will exceed this year's original production targets. According to the current situation, Shaanxi Province has more than 4.7 million mu of cotton fields, and the yield of ginned cotton per mu can be increased by 16 jin compared with the original plan of 44 jin. Shandong Province has more than 6 million mu of cotton fields, and the yield of ginned cotton per mu can reach more than 64 jin. This year's cotton production in Shanxi Province will exceed the highest level in previous years. In Liaoning Province, each cotton plant in more than 3 million mu of cotton fields bears four to five cotton bolls. Although Jiangsu Province's more than 10 million mu of cotton fields have suffered from typhoons and floods, due to the timely soil cultivation and seedling support, 4 million mu can produce 50 jin of ginned cotton per mu, and only 2 million mu are growing poorly. In Hebei, except for some cotton fields that were abandoned due to flooding, the cotton fields in other general disaster areas and lightly affected areas have been strengthened in later-stage management, and there is still a certain harvest. The average yield per mu of 17 million mu of cotton in the province can still reach more than 23 jin.

    全国大部棉田增产有望
    据新华社4日讯　全国大部棉田的棉花开始绽桃吐絮。陕西、山东、山西、河南、新疆、江西等地区已经开始采摘新棉。
    据新华社记者从农业部了解，全国除浙江、江苏、河北等省的棉区因遭受台风和水涝灾害而造成不同程度的减产外，其他如湖北、山东、陕西、江西、山西、甘肃、新疆、四川等产棉省区的棉花生长得都很好，并且都将超过今年原定的生产指标。根据目前情况估计，陕西省有棉田四百七十多万亩，每亩皮棉产量可比原计划的四十四斤增产十六斤。山东省有棉田六百多万亩，每亩可产皮棉六十四斤以上。山西省今年棉花产量将超过历年来的最高水平。辽宁省三百多万亩棉田每株棉花结桃四个到五个。江苏省的一千多万亩棉田虽然遭到台风和水涝，但由于及时进行了培土、扶苗等工作，其中有四百万亩每亩可产皮棉五十斤，只有二百万亩生长得较差。河北除一部分棉田因遭水淹废弃外，其他一般灾区和轻灾区的棉田，由于加强了后期管理，还有一定收成，全省一千七百多万亩棉花每亩平均产量仍可达到二十三斤以上。
