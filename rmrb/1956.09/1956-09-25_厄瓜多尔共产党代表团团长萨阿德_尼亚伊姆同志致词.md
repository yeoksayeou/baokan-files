Comrades:
	On behalf of the Ecuadorian Communist Party, I extend my warmest greetings to the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China. We firmly believe that the resolutions of this congress will make valuable contributions to the socialist transformation of your country and to the cause of striving for world peace and the complete liberation of all mankind.
	Under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese people have carried out a heroic struggle, established a people's democratic regime, and joined the socialist camp with the glorious Soviet Union as its standard-bearer. This has encouraged the people of our countries, which are still under imperialist oppression, to have confidence in winning the victory of the revolutionary struggle.
	The great transformation being carried out in China today shows that this country, which less than ten years ago was still suffering from colonialist oppression, is now advancing towards socialism. This transformation provides a brilliant example for the working class in dependent countries on how to closely ally with the peasants and unite patriots from all walks of life to win victory in the struggle against imperialism. Therefore, the Chinese example is of great significance to the people of Ecuador and other Latin American countries.
	Please allow me to briefly talk about the situation in our country to confirm the correctness of the above words.
	The people of Ecuador, a small country with a population of three and a half million, suffer from the oppression and suffering brought to them by U.S. imperialism and feudal remnants.
	In recent years, Ecuador has become more dependent on U.S. imperialism. When U.S. imperialism suffered defeats in Asia and faced the great liberation struggles that are developing in Africa, it doubled its oppression of Latin America, treating it as a region under its direct control, a source of raw materials, and a military base.
	The entire economy and politics of Ecuador have suffered from the adverse consequences of this situation.
	Ecuador's natural resources, oil, bananas, and international transportation are all controlled by monopoly capital such as Mobil Oil Company and United Fruit Company, which are notoriously known for their predatory policies.
	Imperialism controls our product markets through monetary policies and manipulation of transportation.
	Our originally extremely weak national industry has been severely hit by the tariff system formulated by American technical experts and the policy of dumping products that we can produce ourselves into our country.
	American advisory groups control and manipulate Ecuador's education and health undertakings, and even the army is actually at the beck and call of the advisory groups.
	Ecuador's foreign policy is also subordinate to others. Ecuador's representatives in the United Nations stand on the side of the group that often votes in favor of Washington's aggressive policies and does not recognize the legitimate status of the People's Republic of China.
	We are suffering from the same bad consequences produced by the military treaties that the United States has imposed on other Latin American countries. This military treaty attempts to use our country's land as a military base for aggression and our people as soldiers for carrying out plots that violate human freedom and progress.
	While suffering from imperialist oppression, the people of Ecuador also suffer from the exploitation of a few landlords who maintain a semi-feudal rule.
	Among the total of 120,000 landowners, 240 large feudal landowners occupy 20 percent of the cultivated land, possessing land equivalent to that owned by 90,000 peasants. More than one million Indians live in poverty, with poor working conditions. Most of them earn at most five cents a day, in addition to being able to use a small piece of barren land. Farmers are generally victims of cruel exploitation, they must pay extremely high rents, and they are also exploited by unfair prices for agricultural products.
	All these situations cause general backwardness in the entire country and lower the standard of living. United Nations statistics show that our country is one of the countries with the lowest national income in the world, with an average annual income of no more than fifty US dollars per person in 1950.
	This situation is also manifested in the political aspect. The ruling class has established a government, a government that is ostensibly legitimate, but in reality tramples on the rights of the people, especially the rights of workers; has formulated a tax system that oppresses the masses of the people; and spends 30 percent of the national income mainly on armaments, regardless of the people's urgent needs, health care and education, etc.
	Therefore, our main enemies are the enemies that the Chinese people defeated in their great liberation struggle, namely imperialism and feudalism.
	Our people are fighting to defend their lives and rights, national independence and to seek the path of liberation, and have begun to rise up against these two enemies. Workers and peasants are waging struggles against feudal oppression and imperialist rule in order to strive for a better life and more security. The masses of handicraft workers, who occupy a very important position in the country, have also begun to take action. Students have also risen up to defend their rights, oppose dogmatic education, and strive for national independence. In concrete actions, part of the national bourgeoisie is also opposed to imperialist rule, for example, their resistance to tariff issues and monopoly transportation. The idea of ​​conducting free trade with countries around the world in order to break the capitalist blockade is increasingly popular. Of course, these struggles are still weak, but they show the huge possibility that the people of Ecuador will rapidly develop the struggle for national independence.
	Through these actions, our party is working to establish a great national liberation and democratic front, in which the middle class, handicraftsmen, clerks, intellectuals and national bourgeoisie will also participate together with the working class and peasants. Our party is small and has great shortcomings. We have made serious mistakes, but we will strive to overcome these mistakes. We believe that the revolutionary struggle of our people will surely free us from the shackles that oppress us today.
	We know that we should study the actual situation of our country and seek an appropriate path for our revolution in accordance with the principles of Marxism-Leninism. The experiences of the people of other countries and our fraternal parties will be of invaluable help to us in this great task.
	Therefore, we are here with great enthusiasm to participate in the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China to learn from the great experience in your struggle. Your struggle is a model of creative Marxism, just as the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is an outstanding model of creative Marxism, so we extend our revolutionary gratitude to you.
	Long live the People's Republic of China!
	Long live the Communist Party of China!
	Long live the liberation struggle of the oppressed people!

### 厄瓜多尔共产党代表团团长萨阿德—尼亚伊姆同志致词

专栏：

    厄瓜多尔共产党代表团团长萨阿德—尼亚伊姆同志致词同志们：
    我代表厄瓜多尔共产党向中国共产党第八次代表大会致以最热烈的敬礼。我们深信这次代表大会的决议对你们国家的社会主义改造事业，对争取世界和平和全人类的彻底解放事业将作出宝贵的贡献。
    中国人民在以党中央和毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党的领导下进行了英勇的斗争，建立了人民民主政权，加入到有光荣的苏联为旗手的社会主义阵营。这鼓舞了我们这些还处在帝国主义压迫下的国家的人民取得革命斗争胜利的信心。
    目前在中国进行的伟大的改造事业显示着这个就在不到十年以前还遭受着殖民主义压迫的国家现在正向社会主义迈进。这个改造事业对于附属国的工人阶级应如何紧密地与农民结成联盟、并团结各阶层的爱国人士在反对帝国主义的斗争中取得胜利这方面作出了光辉的榜样。因此，中国的榜样对厄瓜多尔人民和其他拉丁美洲国家人民有着重大的意义。
    请允许我简单的谈谈我国的情况来证实上述的话的正确性。
    厄瓜多尔这个有三百五十万人口的小国的人民，受尽美帝国主义和封建残余带给他们的压迫和苦难。
    最近几年，厄瓜多尔更加依附美帝国主义了。而当美帝国主义在亚洲遭到了失败、在非洲面对着正在发展的伟大的解放斗争的时候，就加倍地压迫拉丁美洲，把它当作自己直接控制的地区、原料供应地和军事基地。
    厄瓜多尔的整个经济和政治遭受到这种形势带来的不良后果。
    厄瓜多尔的自然资源，石油，香蕉，国际运输工具都掌握在像美孚油公司和联合果品公司等素以其掠夺政策闻名的垄断资本手中。
    帝国主义以货币政策和操纵运输来控制我们的产品市场。
    我们原来极其微弱的民族工业又受到美国技术专家所拟订的关税制度以及用我们自己也能生产的产品向我国倾销的政策的严重打击。
    美国的顾问团控制和操纵着厄瓜多尔的教育和卫生事业，甚至于军队实际上也是听命于顾问团的。
    厄瓜多尔的外交政策也是屈从于他人的。厄瓜多尔在联合国的代表站在经常投票拥护华盛顿侵略政策和不承认中华人民共和国的合法地位的集团那边。
    我们遭受着和美国强加在其他拉丁美洲国家身上同样的军事条约所产生的恶果。这个军事条约企图把我国的土地作为进行侵略的军事基地，把我国的人民作为进行违反人类自由和进步的勾当的兵卒。
    厄瓜多尔人民在遭受帝国主义压迫的同时，还遭受着保持半封建统治的少数地主的剥削。
    在总数十二万个土地所有者中间，二百四十个大封建土地所有者占有了耕地的百分之二十，具有相当于九万个农民所有的土地。一百多万个印第安人生活在贫困中，工作条件恶劣。他们中间大部分人除了能使用一小块贫瘠的土地以外，每天所得的工资至多不过五分美元。农民一般都是残酷剥削的牺牲者，他们必须付出极高的地租，还要受到农产品的不公道的价格的剥削。
    所有这些情况使整个国家普遍地落后并使生活水平低落。联合国的统计数字说明，我国是世界上国民收入最低的国家之一，在一九五○年，每人每年平均收入不超过五十美元。
    这种情况也表现在政治方面。统治阶级建立了一个政府，表面上是合法的政府，而实际上却践踏人民的权利，尤其是工人的权利；制定了压榨人民群众的税收制度；并且把国家收入的百分之三十主要用于军备方面，不顾人民的迫切需要、保健事业和教育事业等工作。
    因此我们的主要敌人，就是中国人民在他们伟大的解放斗争中战胜了的敌人，就是帝国主义和封建主义。
    我国人民正在为保卫自己的生命和权利、民族独立和寻求解放的道路而斗争，已经开始起来反抗这两个敌人。工人和农民为争取美好的生活和更多的保障而进行着反抗封建压迫和帝国主义统治的斗争。在全国占极重要地位的手工业工作者群众也开始行动起来。学生们也起来保卫自己的权利，反对教条主义的教育，争取国家的独立。在具体行动方面，部分民族资产阶级也反对帝国主义的统治，例如他们对关税问题和垄断运输的反抗。和世界各国进行自由贸易，以便打破资本主义的封锁的思想，日益受到人们的欢迎。当然这些斗争还是微弱的，但是它们说明了厄瓜多尔人民迅速发展争取民族独立的斗争巨大的可能性。
    通过这些行动，我们的党正为建立一个伟大的民族解放民主战线而努力，中等阶层、手工业者、职员、知识分子和民族资产阶级分子也都将同工人阶级和农民一起参加这个战线。我们的党很小，又有很大的缺点。我们犯了严重的错误，但是我们要努力克服这些错误。我们相信我国人民的革命斗争必将使我们摆脱今天压迫着我们的枷锁。
    我们知道，我们应该依据马克思列宁主义的原则，研究我国的实际情况，寻求我国革命的适当的道路。其他国家的人民和我们的兄弟党的经验，对我们这项伟大任务将有不可估计的帮助。
    因此我们满怀热忱地来参加这次中国共产党第八次全国代表大会，来吸取你们斗争中伟大的经验。你们的斗争是创造性的马克思主义的典范，正如苏联共产党第二十次代表大会是创造性的马克思主义的卓越的典范一样，因此我们向你们致以革命的谢意。
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    被压迫人民的解放斗争万岁！（附图片）
