Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 10th: On the 9th, more than 99% of the six hundred and fifteen male and female athletes who participated in the eight thousand meter and five thousand meter Yangtze River crossing competitions reached the finish line. Only three out of the five hundred and seventy-one men did not reach the finish line; only one of the forty-four women participating in the competition failed to complete the entire course.

The number of people participating in the men's eight thousand meter and women's five thousand meter long-distance swimming competitions this year is more than in any previous year.

The competition started at noon on the 9th. Along the Pearl River, many elderly people from agricultural cooperatives and laughing children gathered. They would occasionally point to the figures of swimming experts from their own cooperative. The finish line of the competition - the Guangzhou Youth Swimming Pool - was even more lively, with countless workers, students, etc. welcoming their partners who reached the finish line.

At noon, the rising tide at the mouth of the Pearl River turned the eastward flowing river water into calm water before the competition began. Midway through the competition, the river water reversed due to the tide, and the athletes swam with the current. Many athletes who have participated in the competition for many years achieved satisfactory results this time. More "newcomers" also had good performances. A swimming "newcomer," Li Xihua, took second place in the men's division with a time of 1 hour, 46 minutes, and 53.8 seconds. The first-place winner, seaman Wang Lianyuan, was only 1 minute and 11 seconds faster than him. The brothers Li Senjie and Li Senbi, returned overseas Chinese who only started learning to swim in June this year, also swam to the finish line. Lu Jiezhen, a 19-year-old who recently won second place in the women's 100-meter and 200-meter breaststroke at the National Aquatic Games, took first place in the women's group this time.

    六百多名运动员参加纵游珠江的比赛
    新华社广州10日电　9日，参加纵游珠江八千公尺和五千公尺比赛的六百一十五名男女运动员，有99％以上都到达终点。在男子五百七十一人中只有三人没有达到终点；女子参加比赛的四十四人中，只有一人没能游完全程。
    今年参加男子八千公尺和女子五千公尺远距离游泳比赛的人，比过去任何一年都多。
    比赛是在9日中午开始的。在珠江沿岸，聚集了许多农业社的老人和欢笑着的孩子们。他们不时指点着自己社里的游泳能手的身影。竞赛的终点——广州市青年游泳场，更是热闹，无数的工人、学生等在那里迎接到达终点的伙伴们。
    中午时分，珠江口的涨潮使东流的江水转入平静后开始比赛，比赛中途，江水因海潮倒流，运动员们就顺水游泳。不少连年参加比赛的运动员，这次获得了满意的成绩。更多的“新手”也有很好的表现。一位游泳“新手”李细华以1小时46分53.8秒得到男子第二名，得到第一名的海员王连元只比他快1分11秒多。今年6月才开始学游泳的归国华侨李森杰、李森碧兄弟，也游到了终点。不久前在全国水上运动会中获得女子一百公尺、二百公尺蛙泳第二名的十九岁的芦洁贞，这次取得了女子组的第一名。
