Beijing Agricultural University Faculty and Students Hold Symposium on Genetics

(Our dispatch) Nearly 400 faculty members and students from Beijing Agricultural University recently held a symposium on genetics.

Professor Li Jingxiong expounded on the material basis of heredity, the environment and heredity, etc., from the perspective of the Morgan school. He also expressed differing views on the theories and work of the Michurin school represented by Lysenko, such as vegetative hybridization and vegetative hybrids, the transformation of winter wheat into spring wheat, the inheritance of acquired characteristics, and directed variation experiments. Professor Wu Zhongxian, based on the chromosome theory of heredity, focused on introducing the development and achievements of biostatistics genetics, and praised some of Michurin's personal work, but also disagreed with some representative research of the Michurin school headed by Lysenko. Professor Lou Chenghou put forward his own views on the material basis of heredity, the inheritance of acquired characteristics, vegetative hybridization, and individual development from the perspective of plant physiology.

Professor Chen Xiufu elaborated on the Michurin school's concept of heredity, focusing on using the achievements of vegetative hybridization to illustrate that acquired characteristics can be inherited and the relationship between environment and heredity, and expressed disagreement with the Morgan theory. Zhou Jiachi, former professor of Beijing Agricultural University and current Deputy Director of the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Health Education of the Ministry of Higher Education, introduced in detail the development of the Morgan theory and the working methods of the Morgan school. At the same time, he pointed out that in terms of ideological line and the way questions are raised, he himself stood on Lysenko's side. Comrade Zhao Shixu, who recently returned from graduating from the Moscow Timiryazev Agricultural Academy, used some examples to prove some of the work of the Michurin school, and raised some questions about the theories of the Morgan school.

Finally, Vice-President Shi Ping supplemented some views on embryology and experimental biology that differed from the previous two schools, and requested the relevant teaching and research sections to continue the discussion in accordance with the principle of letting a hundred schools of thought contend, and to put forward opinions on future genetics teaching and research work. The school's Party organization and administration will do their best to create conditions to meet everyone's requirements. (Jing)

    北京农业大学师生座谈遗传学
    本报讯　北京农业大学的师生近四百人最近举行了关于遗传学问题的座谈会。
    李竞雄教授就遗传的物质基础、环境与遗传等问题以摩尔根学派的观点作了阐述，并对以李森科为代表的米丘林学派的理论和工作，如无性杂交与无性杂种、冬麦春麦互变、获得性的遗传、定向变异等试验提出了不同的看法。吴仲贤教授在染色体遗传学说的基础上着重介绍了生统遗传学的发展和成就，并对米丘林个人的一些工作给以好评，但也不同意以李森科为首的米丘林学派的一些代表性的研究。娄成后教授从植物生理学的观点，对遗传的物质基础、获得性的遗传、无性杂交、个体发育等问题提出了自己的看法。
    陈秀夫教授阐述了米丘林学派对遗传性的概念，着重以无性杂交的成果来说明获得性可以遗传以及环境与遗传的关系，对摩尔根学说提出异议。原北京农业大学教授、现任高等教育部农林卫生教育司副司长周家炽详尽地介绍了摩尔根学说的发展和摩尔根学派的工作方法，同时指出在思想路线上和问题的提法上，他自己是站在李森科一边的。新由莫斯科季米里亚捷夫农学院毕业回国的赵世绪同志用一些事例证明了米丘林学派的一些工作，并对摩尔根学派的理论提出了一些问题。
    最后施平副校长补充了关于胚胎学和实验生物学的不同于前两家的一些见解，并要求有关教研组本着百家争鸣的方针继续讨论，对今后遗传学的教学和研究工作提出意见，学校党组织和行政将尽力创设条件来满足大家的要求。（晶）
