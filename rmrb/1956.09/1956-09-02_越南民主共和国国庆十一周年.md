    Eleventh Anniversary of the National Day of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam
    Yong Wenqian, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam
    September 2nd is a day of great historical significance for Vietnam. Eleven years ago, the Vietnamese people bravely rose up to fight, won the great victory of the August Revolution, and established the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on September 2, 1945. This was the first time in history that our people became masters of their own country. After the establishment of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Vietnamese people went through another eight or nine years of war against the French colonialists and achieved a great victory. Since the restoration of peace, Vietnam has gradually undergone fundamental changes in all aspects of society and economy, creating conditions for the increasingly better life of the people.
    For two years, the Vietnamese people have been continuously fighting for the reunification of their country and have vigorously carried out various restoration and construction works to heal the wounds of war in order to consolidate the North.
    The government and people of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam have consistently and strictly fulfilled the various agreements of Geneva.
    The provisions on ceasefire, regrouping and transfer of troops have been implemented. The North of our country, with a population of over 13 million, the capital Hanoi, and the port of Haiphong have been completely liberated. Since then, the implementation of the Geneva Accords has entered the stage of resolving the relevant political issues, namely, realizing the unification of Vietnam through free general elections.
    On June 6, 1955, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam publicly elaborated its position, that is, from July 20, 1955, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam was ready to consult with the responsible authorities in the South at any time to discuss the organizational work related to the free general elections to be held throughout the country in July 1956.
    Based on the strong desire of the people throughout the country to reunify the motherland and to travel freely, make contact, and find employment between the North and South, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has repeatedly proposed suggestions for both sides to hold consultations and restore normal relations between the North and South. However, the Ngo Dinh Diem regime refused to negotiate under the pretext that "there is no freedom in the North", and tried to undermine the Geneva Accords, carried out bloody suppression of people who supported peace and unification, and stepped up preparations to launch a new war, turning South Vietnam into a military base for US imperialism.
    For two years, despite the cruel fascist suppression policy adopted by the United States and Ngo Dinh Diem in South Vietnam, our compatriots in the South have still persisted in the struggle for the peace and reunification of the motherland. They deeply realize that "the North and South are one family" and "the North and South are blood relatives." Our motherland Vietnam, in terms of geography, history, economy, culture, and ethnicity, was originally a complete country, and no force can divide it. The people of South Vietnam, with their tenacious and courageous fighting spirit, have more than once demanded that the South Vietnamese authorities consult with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and the people of South Vietnam have carried out struggles against unilateral elections, against the fake "National Assembly," and exposing the bloody so-called "accusation against the Communists" campaign by the United States and Ngo Dinh Diem. The people of South Vietnam also demanded security in their lives, demanded solutions to employment problems, and demanded various democratic freedoms and rights. This wave of struggle is spreading and extending from cities to villages. After nine years of extremely arduous resistance war, the compatriots in the South heroically entered a new climax of political struggle. They are infinitely loyal to the cause of independence and unification of the motherland, and have fully demonstrated a strong and unyielding fighting spirit in the face of Ngo Dinh Diem's inhuman and barbaric atrocities, truly worthy of the title of "Copper Wall of the Motherland."
    In September 1955, the Vietnam Fatherland Front was established, which is a new development in the struggle of our people for the unification of the motherland. The program of the Vietnam Fatherland Front is a reasonable and fair action program formulated based on the actual situation in the North and South and the desire for peaceful reunification and democracy of all patriotic people from all walks of life, and it has been warmly welcomed and supported by the people throughout the country.
    At present, the Southern authorities still refuse to hold consultation meetings to discuss issues related to free general elections. On the other hand, the United States is stepping up the import of large quantities of weapons into the South, while the French government is deliberately evading all its responsibilities under the agreement. Our people will encounter many difficulties in the struggle for the unification of the motherland. In this serious situation, in order to be loyal to the principle of resolving all disputes through peaceful negotiations (which is the guiding principle for the signing of the Geneva Accords), we demand that the Geneva Conference, with the participation of the three countries of the International Supervision and Control Commission, be reconvened to discuss issues related to the implementation of the agreement in Indochina.
    Our country, Vietnam, is our own land that our people have diligently built, beautified, maintained and defended with their blood and sweat for centuries. Therefore, Vietnam is a complete country and must be unified. The struggle to achieve the unification of Vietnam peacefully on the basis of independence and democracy will be long and arduous, but it will surely achieve final victory. The Vietnamese people went through eight or nine years of resistance war and finally won victory. In the political struggle, we will also win victory. This is the iron-like unwavering belief of our people.
    In this fierce struggle, the Vietnamese people realize that it is necessary to strengthen construction, heal the wounds of war and restore the national economy in the already liberated North. Consolidating the North in all aspects is an important factor in determining victory.
    Since the restoration of peace two years ago, the hardworking people of the North have devoted their efforts to building their motherland and have achieved great success. The first two-year plan to restore the national economy and initially develop culture is being gradually implemented.
    Our country, which has been ravaged by fifteen years of war, has suffered severe economic destruction. Crops, livestock and farm implements have been severely damaged. Almost all water conservancy projects have been completely breached, and nearly 140,000 hectares of farmland have been abandoned. The people in the occupied areas are becoming increasingly impoverished. However, only two years after the restoration of peace, agricultural production has achieved many good results. 100,300 hectares of wasteland have been replanted with crops; larger water conservancy projects such as the Pei Shang and Tuo Kuang dams have been built, ensuring irrigation for 320,000 hectares of farmland. The summer harvest in 1955 increased by 43% compared to 1954, and the autumn harvest also increased by 17%. This year's early rice harvest is particularly good. The production area has also increased by 15% compared to last year.
    Regarding the restoration and development of industry, after the people's government took over the major cities, it immediately started construction and stepped up the repair of factories that the other side had looted and destroyed before their retreat, such as the Hongji Coal Mine, the Cement Plant, the Nandinh Textile Factory, the Fertilizer Factory, the Haiphong Shipyard, the Gialin Locomotive Repair Factory, and the Hanoi Haiphong Power Plant. While repairing the above-mentioned factories, we also built some new enterprises, such as the Unity Match Factory, the Fushou Tea Factory, and the Fish Cannery.
    Small industries and handicrafts that supply the necessities of people's daily life, such as the blacksmithing industry for manufacturing agricultural implements, the cast iron pot industry, ceramics, woodware, bricks and tiles, face towels, undershirts, socks, cloth shoes, and other production industries, have been encouraged and developed.
    All transportation lines have also received special attention. Railways such as Hanoi-Muc Nam Quan, Hanoi-Lao Cai, and Hanoi-Nam Dinh, totaling more than 500 kilometers in length, have been opened to traffic one after another. The original more than 2,000 kilometers of highways and 82 kilometers of newly paved highways have also been completed.
    Another extremely important central task in construction is the land reform work that has been carried out in the North. Up to now, after five phases of the movement, land reform in the North has been basically completed.
    Due to these fundamental reforms, the lives of the working people in cities and rural areas have gradually improved.
    The Democratic Republic of Vietnam firmly pursues the principle of peaceful coexistence. In the past two years, thanks to the implementation of a correct foreign policy of peace and friendship, our country's international status has greatly improved, our friendship with the people of fraternal countries has been strengthened, and our relations with Southeast Asian countries have also been consolidated and developed.
    The friendship between the Vietnamese people and the people of India, Burma, Indonesia and Egypt is deepening. Vietnam has dispatched consuls general to India and Indonesia, and has also established government representative offices in Burma. Especially with the Kingdoms of Cambodia and Laos, which are closest to Vietnam and geographically adjacent, our relations have shown a scene that will lead to greater friendship and amity.
    The Vietnamese people express their heartfelt gratitude to the Soviet Union, China and other democratic countries for their generous and selfless assistance. In recent years, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has signed many trade and cultural agreements with China. People's organizations and cultural delegations from the two countries have exchanged friendly visits. There is an unbreakable friendship between Vietnam and China. This friendship did not begin today, but is an inherent and long-standing connection that closely links the history of the two countries. The revolutionary struggle and national construction experience of the Chinese people have played an extremely important role in the victory of the Vietnamese revolution. China's economic and technical assistance is invaluable for the restoration of our motherland's construction cause.
    Today, on the occasion of the National Day of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, we would like to extend our cordial greetings to the Chinese people and wish you great achievements in the cause of socialist construction under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese government headed by Mao Zedong.
    Looking back on the eleven years since the birth of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Vietnamese people are full of confidence and firmly maintain the will to fight tenaciously, work hard, and overcome all difficulties and obstacles, and strive to learn from the advanced experience of fraternal countries in building socialism. The Vietnamese people firmly believe that although they will encounter difficulties on the road ahead, with the great unity of the people throughout the country and with the support of the Soviet Union, China and fraternal countries, as well as peace-loving people all over the world, we will surely achieve victory. Vietnam will surely be unified, and our cause of building the motherland will surely succeed. (Special contribution to this newspaper)

    越南民主共和国国庆十一周年
    越南民主共和国外交部副部长　雍文谦
    9月2日是越南一个具有重大历史意义的日子。十一年前，越南人民英勇地起来进行斗争，获得了八月革命的伟大胜利，于1954年9月2日建立了越南民主共和国。这是有史以来，我国人民第一次成为自己国家的主人。越南民主共和国成立后，越南人民又经过了八、九年反对法国殖民主义者的战争，取得了伟大的胜利。和平恢复以来，越南在社会和经济各个方面都逐渐走向根本的变化，为人民日益美好的生活创造了条件。
    两年来，越南人民为争取实现祖国的统一而不断地进行斗争，并为巩固北方而大力地进行了医治战争创伤的各项恢复建设工作。
    越南民主共和国政府和人民始终如一地严格履行日内瓦的各项协议。
    关于停火、集结和转移军队等条款已经得到实施。拥有一千三百余万人口的我国北方、首都河内和海港海防得到了完全解放。自此，履行日内瓦协议便进入解决有关政治问题的条款，即通过自由普选的方式，实现越南的统一。
    1955年6月6日，越南民主共和国政府曾公开阐述了自己的立场，就是从1955年7月20日起，越南民主共和国政府随时准备同南方负责当局进行协商，讨论有关1956年7月在全国范围内进行自由普选问题的组织工作。
    基于全国人民要求祖国统一和在南北两个地区间自由往返、接触和就业的深切愿望，越南民主共和国政府曾屡次提出关于双方进行协商和恢复南北正常关系的建议。但是吴庭艳政权却以“北方没有自由”为借口拒绝协商，力图破坏日内瓦协议，对赞成和平、统一的人士进行血腥的镇压，加紧准备发动新战争，把南越变成美帝国主义的军事基地。
    两年来，尽管美国和吴庭艳在南越采取了残酷的法西斯镇压政策，但是我们南方同胞却仍然坚持为祖国的和平和统一的斗争。他们深刻地认识到“南北是一家”、“南北是血肉相关的”。我们祖国越南，在地理、历史、经济、文化、民族等方面本来是一个完整的国家，任何力量都不能分割。具有顽强和勇敢的斗争精神的南越人民不止一次地要求南越当局同越南民主共和国进行协商，南越人民并进行了反对片面选举、反对伪“国会”、揭露美国和吴庭艳充满血腥的所谓“控诉共产党”战役等斗争。南越人民还要求生活获得保障，要求解决就业问题，要求各项民主自由权利。这一斗争的浪潮，从城市到乡村，正在漫延和伸展着。南方同胞经历了九年极其艰苦的抗战以后，又英勇地进入新的政治斗争高潮。他们无限忠诚于祖国的独立、统一事业，对吴庭艳毫无人道的野蛮暴行，充分表现了坚强的不屈不挠的斗争精神，真不愧为“祖国铜墙”的称号。
    1955年9月，越南祖国战线成立，这是我国人民争取祖国统一的斗争中的新进展。越南祖国战线的纲领是以南北两个地区的实际情况和所有爱国的各阶层人民对和平统一和民主的愿望为出发点而制定的合理合情的行动纲领，它获得了全国人民的热烈欢迎和拥护。
    目前，南方当局仍然拒绝举行讨论有关自由普选问题的协商会议。另一方面，美国却加紧向南方输入大量武器，而法国政府却故意逃避其对协议的一切职责。我国人民在为争取祖国统一的斗争中还会遇到许多困难。在这种严重的情况下，为了忠诚于以和平谈判方式解决一切争端的方针（这是签订日内瓦各项协议的指导路线），我们要求重新召开有国际监督和监察委员会三个国家参加的日内瓦会议，以讨论有关在印度支那实施协议的问题。
    我们的国家越南，是我国人民多少个世纪以来流尽了血汗辛勤地建设、美化、维护和保卫下来的自己的国土。所以，越南是一个完整的国家，必须获得统一。在独立和民主的基础上，通过和平方式实现越南统一的斗争将是长期而艰苦的，但是一定将取得最后的胜利。越南人民经历了八、九年的抗战，终于取得了胜利。在政治斗争中，也将要赢得胜利。这是我国人民钢铁般的不可动摇的信念。
    在这场激烈的斗争中，越南人民意识到必须在已经解放了的北方加强建设、医治战争创伤和恢复国民经济。从各个方面巩固北方，这是决定胜利的重要因素。
    自从和平恢复两年以来，勤劳的北方人民献出了力量、建设自己的祖国，并且已经取得了巨大的成就。恢复国民经济和初步发展文化的第一个两年计划正在逐步实现中。
    经受了十五年战火蹂躏的我国，经济遭到严重的摧残，庄稼耕畜和农具遭受严重毁坏，所有的水利工程几乎全部溃决，差不多十四万公顷的田地荒芜了；沦陷区的人民日趋贫困。但是和平刚恢复两年，农业生产获得了许多良好的成就。十万零三百公顷的荒地已经重新种上了庄稼；较大的水利工程如沛上、托况等水坝已经修建起来，保证了三十二万公顷田地的灌溉。1955年的夏收比1954年增加43％，秋收也多了17％。今年的早稻收成特别好。生产面积也比去年增加15％。
    关于恢复和发展工业方面，在人民政权接管了各大城市以后，对于对方在撤退前劫走和破坏的工厂，如鸿基煤矿、水泥厂、南定纺织厂、肥料制造厂、海防船坞、嘉林机车修理厂和河内海防发电厂等，都马上兴工加紧修建。在修复上述工厂的同时，我们还新建了一些企业，例如统一火柴厂、富寿茶业厂和鱼罐头厂等。
    供应人们日常生活所必需的小工业和手工业，如制造农具的打铁业、铸铁锅业、陶瓷器、木器、砖瓦、面巾、汗衫、袜子、布鞋等生产行业，都得到鼓励和发展。
    各条交通运输线，也都特别受到重视，河内—睦南关，河内—老街，河内—南定等共长五百多公里的铁路已经先后通车了。原有两千多公里的公路和八十二公里新铺的公路也都修筑完工了。
    还有一件在建设中极其重要的中心工作，就是在北方已进行的土地改革工作。直到目前为止，经过五期运动，北方的土地改革已经基本完成了。
    由于这些基本的改革，城市和农村的劳动人民的生活已经逐渐获得改善。
    越南民主共和国坚定地奉行和平共处原则。两年来，由于执行了正确的和平友谊的外交政策，我们国家的国际地位大为提高，我们和各兄弟国家人民的友谊日益加强；我们和东南亚各国的关系也得到了巩固和发展。
    越南人民同印度、缅甸、印度尼西亚和埃及各国人民之间的友谊日益深厚。越南已经派遣驻印度和印度尼西亚的总领事，同时在缅甸设立了政府代表机构。尤其是与越南最接近而地理上毗连的柬埔寨和老挝王国，在我们之间的关系中已经显示出将导致更友好和亲善的景象。
    越南人民对苏联、中国以及各民主国家慷慨和无私的援助表示衷心的感谢。近年来越南民主共和国曾经同中国签订了许多关于贸易和文化的协定。两国人民团体和文化代表团互相进行友好访问。越南和中国之间具有牢不可破的友谊。这种友谊并不是今天才开始的而是固有的悠久的联系把两国的历史紧密地连接起来的。中国人民的革命斗争和建设祖国的经验对于越南革命的胜利已经起了极其巨大的作用。中国的经济和技术的援助对于恢复我们祖国的建设事业是非常宝贵的。
    今天值此越南民主共和国国庆之际，我们谨向中国人民致以亲切的敬礼，祝你们在以毛泽东为首的中国共产党和中国政府的领导下，在社会主义的建设事业中取得伟大的成就。
    回顾自从越南民主共和国诞生到现在十一年的过程，越南人民满怀信心坚决保持着顽强斗争、艰苦奋斗和克服一切困难和障碍的意志，努力学习兄弟国家建设社会主义中的先进经验。越南人民深信，在前进的道路上，虽然还会遇到困难，但是，在全国人民伟大的团结下，在苏联、中国和各兄弟国家以及全世界爱好和平人民的支持下，我们一定取得胜利。越南一定获得统一，我们建设祖国的事业一定获得成功。（本报特约稿）
