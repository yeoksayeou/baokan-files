    Lighter Doesn't Light
    I bought a "101" lighter produced by Shanghai Rongshengchang Hardware Factory with excitement. After using it for three days, it started acting up. With sufficient flint and oil, it wouldn't light, and repairs were ineffective. The screw cap at the end of the lighter wasn't tight either, and it leaked oil constantly. It was a disaster if put in a pocket.
    I hope Rongshengchang Hardware Factory improves product quality and eliminates this problem.

    打火机打不着火
    我怀着兴奋的心情买了一只上海戎生錩五金制造厂生产的“一○一”打火机，用了三天，它就耍起脾气来了。在火石、机油充足的情况下，打不出火来，修理也无效。打火机尾部的丝帽还不紧，上了油，就漏个不住，装到衣袋里就倒楣。
    希望戎生錩五金制造厂提高产品质量，杜绝这种弊病。
