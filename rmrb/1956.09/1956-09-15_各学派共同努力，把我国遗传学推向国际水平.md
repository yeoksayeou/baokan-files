Various Schools Work Together to Advance China's Genetics to International Levels
Zu Deming, Deputy Director of the North China Agricultural Science Research Institute

Genetic research work in our country has not yet been mastered by independent professional institutions. For many years, all genetic research work has been scattered in some scientific research institutions and universities, with little contact with each other, let alone schools with unique insights that surpass other countries.

At the recent genetics symposium, Li Senko's school, Mendel, Morgan's school, etc., were often mentioned. In fact, among genetic researchers in our country, no distinct schools have been formed from their own research work. It is just that due to different school backgrounds, different institutions, different research objects, and different ideological methods, each has different opinions.

Among all the different views, the biggest difference lies in the discussion of what determines the expression of genetic traits. Some scientists believe that it is mainly determined by the action of chromosome genes, and that genes have strong stability, are inherently fixed, and new genes cannot be produced after birth. However, other scientists disagree with this statement. They believe that although the chromosome gene theory can explain some genetic phenomena, it is too far-fetched in many cases. Because when the school that believes in gene theory cannot explain certain quantities of genes, they often add one or more genes to explain, or use some kind of mutual relationship between certain genes to explain, which inevitably makes people feel like they are in a fog of genes. Some scientists have also respectively put forward experimental reports on spring wheat changing to winter wheat, asexual hybrids, multi-father pollination, and embryonic development, etc. They believe that these phenomena are difficult to explain with gene theory, or cannot be explained at all. Secondly, the school that denies the existence of genes believes, based on various studies, that not only the nucleus in the cell is closely related to genetic phenomena, but all substances outside the nucleus are also closely related to genetic phenomena, even if the degree of correlation is different. They also say that if it is admitted that the genetic traits of an organism are formed under certain environmental conditions, then it cannot be denied that genetic traits may not change under changed environmental conditions, even if genetic traits have a certain stability.

Since the various schools have different views on the above issues, there are various divergent opinions when discussing whether acquired traits can be inherited. In the view of the school that believes in gene theory, acquired traits cannot be inherited, because they believe that genes can only mutate under strong abnormal conditions, and are unchanged under normal conditions. They also point out that although genes and chromosomes can mutate, this mutation is non-directional, and may be beneficial to people or may be harmful to people. People can only artificially select after beneficial mutations occur, but the school itself also admits that the appearance rate of beneficial mutations is very rare. In contrast, the school that denies the existence of genes believes that when the body type of an organism changes under changed environmental conditions, its metabolic type will change. If the changes in the metabolic type of the body type are transmitted to the germ cells, it will cause the metabolic type of the species type to change consistently, so that acquired traits can be inherited to future generations. Starting from the belief that acquired traits can be inherited, this school believes that as long as humans reveal the conditions for the formation of genetic traits, they can use and strengthen these conditions to directionally cultivate new types that are beneficial to people. In fact, under natural conditions, in the work of Michurin and his successors, and in the research of microbial genetics, etc., there are many examples of directional variation and directional cultivation, and they have already played a certain role in scientific research and production practice. They also pointed out that the phenomenon of diversity of variant individuals seen in nature or under artificial conditions cannot be regarded as the uncertainty of the origin of variation, because all natural phenomena have causes and effects. The diversity of variant individuals is the result of the inconsistent external conditions in which individuals are located. The clearer humans reveal the conditions for the occurrence of variation, the more confident they will be in leading to the occurrence of directional variation.

The above differences are, in the final analysis, the old problems that have been debated for many years in genetics. In August 1948, the Soviet Academy of Agricultural Sciences launched a fierce debate centered on Lysenko's "On the Current Situation of Biological Science," but the focus of the debate was basically the same as what was said above. The recent genetics symposium held in Qingdao was convened with reference to the experience of the 1948 meeting of the Soviet Academy of Agricultural Sciences, in the spirit of letting a hundred flowers bloom; hoping that through the speeches of scientists, we can clearly know what common views everyone has and what different views they have, so as to find a common foundation among Chinese genetic researchers and formulate goals for future research; neither hoping that the various schools will reconcile with each other, nor hoping that the various schools will discriminate against each other.

At present, there is a common foundation among genetic researchers in our country. First of all, everyone is willing to serve the socialist construction of the motherland, willing to reveal the laws in genetic phenomena to provide methods for controlling nature, and willing to make domestic genetics catch up with international levels within twelve years. This is the basic aspect. In terms of academics, from the content of everyone's speeches at this symposium, it can be seen that various schools in genetics have made considerable progress in research work in recent years. Among them, the views on certain issues have gradually approached each other from the past differences. For example, the Mendel-Morgan school, which believes that chromosome genes are special substances that govern genetic phenomena, has not made any new elaborations on the special role of chromosome genes in recent years. On the contrary, from the research of microbial genetics, cytoplasmic genetics, embryology, physiology, and biochemistry, they have gradually realized the huge role of cytoplasm, especially environmental conditions, on heredity, thereby initially unlocking the shackles of the chromosome gene theory. On the other hand, the Lysenko school, which believes that environmental conditions are important conditions for governing genetic phenomena and underestimates the role of certain stimulating factors in genetic and breeding research work, has gradually recognized the certain effects of applying chemical drugs, radiation and other physical treatments in genetic and breeding research work in recent years, and strengthened the research of cytogenetics. All these approaches are the expansion of the common foundation, and also the sign of genetics moving forward.

Why do different views in science gradually converge? This is because the task of science is to reveal natural laws and make nature serve mankind, and natural laws are objectively existing. The reason why the natural laws recognized by ordinary scientists are not completely consistent is only because the things that scientists come into contact with in their short lives are ultimately limited, and experimental research cannot be done much, so the conclusions and theories established by scientists inevitably have more or less one-sidedness and superficiality, that is, there is still a certain distance between the perceived laws and the objectively existing laws. If scientists are good at analyzing and accepting the scientific heritage of their predecessors and domestic and foreign scientific achievements, and are brave in learning the strengths of the opposing party and correcting their own shortcomings, they will reduce subjective components due to the expansion and deepening of the field of knowledge, and finally unite into objective truth through approximation.

It should be admitted that the theories and methods that the various schools currently firmly believe in cannot be said to have reached the highest peak in science. The emerging school should not abandon the rich scientific facts accumulated by the original school for many years of research simply because they differ from their own views; the original school should not despise the scientific laws revealed by the emerging school simply because they are not rich enough. Michurin once said: "Those who understand my theories and methods are not my good students; those who overthrow my theories and methods are my good students." We should well understand Michurin's words, which are full of great scientific spirit.

However, it is not easy for everyone to switch from one path to another in science. Some scientists often seize on some shortcomings in the experimental design of the opposing party to completely deny or doubt the reliability of the other party's results, and thus fail to deeply analyze its reference value. This is wrong. We believe that if one school doubts the reliability of certain experimental results of another school, it should conduct precise research with reference to the other party's experimental methods to see what happens; if this is not done, it will be detrimental to the development of science.

In this symposium, the participation of embryologists, biochemists, botanists, zoologists, entomologists, and physiologists has greatly enlightened and helped the discussion of many major issues in genetics. It can be clearly seen from this that the revelation of genetic laws cannot be viewed from a single perspective, but must be combined with related disciplines.

Genetics is a basic discipline in biological science, and it is also a relatively young and weak link in our country's natural science. It needs to be strengthened rapidly, comprehensively, and deeply in order to catch up with international levels within twelve years. This requires our genetic researchers to open up the past situation of guarding one side, expand the field of experimental research, and further establish mutual observation, mutual understanding, mutual inspiration, and mutual assistance relationships on the good start of this symposium from contention to unity. I think this is the direction that our genetic researchers should strive for.

    各学派共同努力，把我国遗传学推向国际水平
    华北农业科学研究所副所长  祖德明
    遗传学的研究工作，在我国还没有独立的专业机构来掌握。许多年以来，所有遗传学的研究工作只分散在一部分科学研究机关和高等院校中，彼此很少联系，更谈不上有超乎其他国家的、有独特见解的学派。
    在最近召开的遗传学座谈会上，常常提到李森科学派、孟德尔、摩尔根学派等等，其实，在我国遗传研究工作者之间，还没有从本身的研究工作上形成鲜明的派别，只不过是由于出身学校的不同、所在机关的不同、研究对象的不同、思想方法的不同，各具有不同的见解而已。
    在所有不同的见解中，出入最大的是关于遗传性状的表现决定于什么这一问题的讨论。其中有些科学家认为主要决定于染色体基因的作用，并且认为基因具有强的稳定性，是先天固有的，后天不能产生新的基因。但是另一些科学家不同意这个说法，他们认为用染色体基因学说虽然可以解释一部分遗传现象，但在不少的场合中过于勉强，因为相信基因学说的学派在用某些数量的基因解释不通的时候，往往就加上一个或一个以上的基因来解释，或者用某些基因之间有某种相互关系来解释，这就难免使人感到如处基因的五里雾中。还有些科学家分别提出了有关春麦变冬麦、无性杂种、多父本授精以及胚胎发育等等方面的试验报告，他们认为这些现象用基因学说很难解释，或者根本不能解释。其次，否认基因存在的学派根据多方面的研究，认为在细胞内不仅细胞核同遗传现象有密切的关系，细胞核以外的所有物质同遗传现象也有密切的关系，纵然相关的程度有所不同。他们又说，如果承认生物体的遗传性状是在一定的环境条件下形成的，那就不能否认遗传性状在改变了的环境条件下没有发生改变的可能，纵然遗传性状有一定的稳定性。
    既然在上述问题上各学派有着不同的见解，从而在讨论到获得性能否遗传的问题时，也就有种种分歧的言论。在相信基因学说的学派看来，获得性是不能遗传的，因为他们认为基因只有在强烈的异常的条件下，才有发生变异的可能，在通常的条件下是不变的。他们又指出，基因和染色体虽然能发生突变，但这种突变是不定向的，也可能对人有利，也可能对人不利，人们只有在有利的突变降临以后，才能加以人为的选择，可是该学派自己也承认有利突变的出现率是非常稀少的。和这相反，否认基因存在的学派认为生物体型在改变了的环境条件下，它的新陈代谢类型就会发生变化，体型的新陈代谢类型所发生的变化如果传到生殖细胞，就会使种型的新陈代谢类型发生一致的变化，从而获得性可以向后代遗传。这一学派从获得性可以遗传的信念出发，认为人类只要揭明了遗传性状的形成条件，就可以利用和加强这些条件，定向地培育出对人有利的新的类型。实际上，在自然情况下，在米丘林和他的后继者们的工作中，以及在微生物遗传等等研究上，有不少定向变异和定向培育的实例，并且在科学研究和生产实践上已经起了一定的作用。他们还指出，在自然界或在人为条件下所看到的变异个体的多样性现象，并不能看作起源变异的不定性，因为一切自然现象都有因有果，变异个体的多样性是个体间所处在的外界条件不一致的结果，人类对于变异发生的条件揭发得越清楚，就越会有把握地导致定向变异的发生。
    以上这些分歧，归根到底还是遗传学中多年争论不休的老问题。1948年8月苏联农业科学院曾经以李森科关于“论生物科学现况”为中心展开了激烈的论战，可是争论焦点基本上和上面所说的是一样的。最近在青岛举行的遗传学座谈会是参照苏联农业科学院1948年会议的经验，本着百家争鸣的精神召开的；希望通过科学家们的发言，明确知道大家究竟有哪些共同的见解，有哪些不同的见解，以便找出中国遗传研究工作者间的共同基础，拟定今后钻研的目标；既不希望各学派相互调和，更不希望各学派相互歧视。
    目前我国遗传研究工作者之间有着共同基础。首先，大家都愿意为祖国的社会主义建设服务，都愿意揭发遗传现象中的规律以提供控制自然的方法，都愿意使国内的遗传学在十二年内赶上国际水平，这是基本的一方面；在学术上从这次座谈会上大家的发言内容可以看出，遗传学中的各个学派近年在研究工作上都有不少的发展，其中对某些问题的看法，已经由过去的分歧，逐渐有了相互接近的趋势。例如，相信染色体基因为支配遗传现象的特殊物质的孟德尔、摩尔根学派，在染色体基因的特殊作用上，最近若干年并没有新的阐发，相反地，却从微生物遗传、细胞质遗传、胚胎学、生理学以及生物化学等方面的研究，渐渐察觉到细胞质特别是环境条件对于遗传的巨大作用，从而初步解开了染色体基因学说的束缚。从另一方面说，相信环境条件为支配遗传现象的重要条件而轻视某些刺激因素在遗传和育种研究工作中的作用的李森科学派，几年来已经逐渐承认应用化学药品、放射线和其他物理学处理在遗传以及育种研究工作中的某些效用，并加强了细胞遗传学的研究。所有这些接近就是共同基础的扩大，也是遗传学向前跨进的标志。
    为什么科学上的不同见解会逐渐接近呢？这是因为科学的任务在于揭发自然规律，使自然为人类服务，而自然规律是客观存在的，平常不同科学家所认识的自然规律之所以不完全一致，只是因为科学家们在短短的一生中所接触的事物终究有限，试验研究更不能作得很多，因而科学家们所下的结论和所确立的学说，都不免具有或多或少的片面性和表面性，也就是所觉察到的规律和客观存在的规律之间还有若干距离。假如，科学家们善于分析和接受先代的科学遗产和国内外的科学成就，勇于学习争论对方的长处而修正自己的短处，就会因为知识领域的扩大和深入而减少主观成分，最后由接近而统一到客观真理中。
    应该承认，目前各学派所坚信的理论和方法，都不能说是已达到了科学上的最高峰。新兴的学派对于原有的学派多少年以来经过研究所积累下来的丰富的科学事实，不应该因为他们和自己的观点不同，而一概抛弃；原有的学派对新兴的学派所揭发的科学规律，不能因为它们还不够充实而加以轻视。米丘林曾经说：“懂得我的理论和方法的不算我的好学生，推翻我的理论和方法的才是我的好学生。”对于米丘林这句富有伟大科学精神的话，我们应该很好地领会。
    但是，在科学上从一条路转到另一条路，并不是人人可以轻易作到的事。有的科学家往往抓住争论对方某些试验设计上的一些缺点，就来全盘否定或怀疑对方的结果的可靠性，从而不去深入分析它可供参考的价值。这是不对的。我们认为，假如一个学派怀疑另一学派某些试验结果的可靠性，就应该参照对方的试验方法，进行精密的研究，以观究竟；假如不这样做，对于科学事业的发展是不利的。
    在这次座谈会中，由于有胚胎学家、生物化学家、植物学家、动物学家、昆虫学家和生理学家的参加，对于遗传学中许多重大问题的讨论，有很大的启发和帮助。从这里可清楚地看出，关于遗传学规律的揭发不能单单从一个角度着眼，必须同有关学科结合起来进行。
    遗传学是生物科学中的基础学科，同时又是我国自然科学中比较年青的和薄弱的一环，需要迅速地全面地深入地加强研究工作，以便在十二年内赶上国际水平。这就需要我们遗传研究工作者打开以往各守一方的局面，扩大试验研究工作的领域，在这次座谈会从争鸣达到团结的良好开端上，进一步建立相互观摩、相互了解、相互启发、相互帮助的关系。我想，这就是我们遗传研究工作者所应该努力的方向。
