    Don't Neglect the Personal Interests of Party Members
    Xing Huan
    Some time ago, the newspaper editorial department received a letter from a comrade of the CPC Luzhou Prefectural Committee in Sichuan, reflecting the opinions of some Party members of the Luzhou Prefectural Committee regarding the poor living conditions of general office cadres. At the end of the letter, he raised the following question: Can a Communist Party member express opinions and demands regarding his own life issues? Is this "individualism"?
    Not long ago, the Yangtze Daily also published letters from Communist Party members Zhang Qingshan and Yu Hou'an: these two Party members were working as temporary workers at the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge Engineering Bureau, some for more than a year, and some for more than two years. They have consistently worked actively and performed well, but have not yet been transferred to formal workers. There are also some members of the masses who have similar experiences, and these people hope that they can reflect the opinions and demands of the masses to the relevant Party organizations, but because they are Party members, they dare not reflect, fearing that they will be criticized as "individualistic" if they do so. In the end, they had no choice but to raise the issue with the newspaper.
    Why do these comrades ask such questions and have such concerns? In fact, it is not surprising that they do, because in real life, there are indeed many cases of neglecting the personal interests of Party members or the masses.
    Long Yongxiu, a Communist Party member from Hanchuan County, Hubei Province, married a female teacher from Chengguan Primary School in the county in the autumn of 1955. Less than three months later, the Hanchuan County Bureau of Culture and Education transferred her to the countryside. Although Long Yongxiu repeatedly mobilized and persuaded her, she was still unwilling to go. Later, Long Yongxiu considered that since she was unwilling to go, and the Chengguan Primary School also needed teachers, he asked the leadership whether she could not be transferred. As a result, the person was transferred, and Long Yongxiu was criticized at the Party group meeting, saying that he was "individualistic," "selfish," "hedonistic," etc., and that Party members should not have such demands.
    Tie Zhongxiao, a Communist Party member from Guanchi Township, Dali County, Shaanxi Province, has consistently worked actively and has been selected several times as a model for preferential treatment and public security in the county, and has received four or five awards. He is now a Party representative of the county and the director of the supervisory committee of the agricultural production cooperative. Because he is busy serving the masses all day long, the house he lives in has been leaking for a long time and has not been repaired. This spring, it was really impossible not to repair the house, and his son returned home from demobilization and wanted to marry a wife. Therefore, he decided to repair it. However, his family's life was relatively difficult, and he did not have enough money to repair the house. He applied to the Party branch three times to help him borrow some money from the credit cooperative, but was rejected each time. Branch Secretary Ma Wentang criticized him and said: "A Communist Party member, instead of actively demanding to do work, is doing things for private individuals. There is no such money for you to borrow." He talked to Township Head Wang Yunzhong four times, but it was not resolved. He was forced to borrow money from rich peasants to repair the house.
  There are many similar situations: a Party member requests to leave his post to apply for a university; some female Party members are burdened by their children, which affects their work and health, and request the organization to run childcare facilities... etc., are all regarded as "individualism," "only seeing personal interests, and not obeying the interests of the Party and the country"! Because, in the eyes of the leaders of some Party organizations, Party members should not have personal demands, and making personal demands is undoubtedly "individualism." Under this strange "logic" of the leaders, who would dare to take the risk of "disobeying" to raise personal opinions and demands?
    Should Party members have personal demands? Is it "individualism" to make personal demands? We say that Party members can have personal demands, and they inevitably will have personal demands. And in order to solve the problem, Party members' personal demands can also be raised to the Party organization. Because although Party members are vanguard fighters of the working class and have a higher level of consciousness than the general public, Party members are also people living in a real society, just like the general public! Since they are people, they inevitably have the same personal demands as ordinary people: demanding appropriate work, demanding family reunions, demanding further study, demanding solutions to their clothing, food, housing, and transportation problems, and demanding solutions to the problem of raising children... However, the solution of these problems is often beyond the reach of individual Party members and must rely on the organization to solve. Therefore, it is "a matter of course" for Party members to make their personal demands to the Party organization. It is completely wrong for some Party organizations to indiscriminately label all Party members who make personal demands with the label of "individualism."
    Comrade Liu Shaoqi told us long ago in his book "On the Self-Cultivation of Communists": "Although the general interests of the Party include the personal interests of Party members, they cannot be completely included, and the individuality of Party members cannot and should not be eliminated. Party members still have some private problems that they need to deal with themselves, and they must also develop themselves according to their personality and strengths. Therefore, the Party allows Party members to establish their personal and even family lives and develop their personal personality and strengths within the scope of not violating the interests of the Party. … The Party also takes care of and protects the indispensable interests of Party members under possible conditions—such as giving them opportunities for education and learning, and solving their health and family problems… This is what Party leaders must pay attention to when dealing with the problems of Party members."
    It can be seen from this that the personal interests of those Party members mentioned earlier: temporary workers demanding to be transferred to formal workers; couples demanding to be transferred to work together; female cadres demanding that the organization run childcare facilities... etc., are all legitimate and reasonable, and the Party should pay attention to solving them. Solving these personal interests of Party members well will not only not harm the collective interests of the Party, but, on the contrary, will further consolidate the collective interests of the Party due to the improvement of Party members' enthusiasm. The reason why some leaders of our Party organizations put the label of "individualism" on Party members who make such demands is that some of them do not have a correct understanding of these issues, and some of them use the name of safeguarding "the interests of the Party" to cover up their "bureaucratism" of not caring about the suffering of the masses.
    Of course, if a Party member always puts personal interests first, is preoccupied with personal interests, demands status and treatment from the Party, and endlessly demands that the Party satisfy all his wishes and demands; when personal interests conflict with the interests of the Party, he is unwilling to give up personal interests and obey the interests of the Party... etc. This is of course "individualism." However, as a Party organization, even if we are dealing with the personal demands of such Party members (we do have such Party members today), we should not simply and rudely label them with a hat of "individualism" and be done with it, but should patiently educate and criticize them, so that they can consciously abandon illegitimate personal interests and obey the interests of the Party on the basis of improved understanding.
    In short, at all times, our Party organization can only further promote the enthusiasm of Party members and mobilize all positive factors to serve the cause of the Party if it appropriately takes care of the personal interests of Party members and meets the legitimate demands of Party members under the principle of not hindering the interests of the Party. Neglecting the personal interests of Party members will damage the enthusiasm of Party members, which ultimately harms the interests of the Party.

### 不要漠视党员的个人利益

    不要漠视党员的个人利益
    星环
    前些日子，报纸编辑部接到中共四川泸州地委会一位同志的来信，在信上他反映了泸州地委的一些党员同志对于一般机关干部生活居住条件太差的意见。在信的最后，他提出了这样一个问题：一个共产党员能不能对有关自己的生活问题提出意见和要求？这是不是“个人主义”？
    不久以前，长江日报也发表了共产党员章清山、喻厚安的来信：这两个党员在武汉长江大桥工程处做临时工，有的做了一年多，有的已经两年多了。他们工作一贯积极，表现很好，但到现在还没有转为正式工。和他们有同样遭遇的还有一部分群众，这些群众很希望他们能够向有关党组织反映群众的意见和要求，但是，他们因为是党员不敢反映，害怕反映了以后会被批评为“个人主义”。最后，没有办法只好把问题向报纸提出。
    这些同志为什么会提出这样的问题，会存在这样的顾虑呢？其实，这也难怪他们，因为，在现实生活中，不关心党员或群众个人利益的事情，确实不少。
    湖北汉川县共产党员龙庸修，1955年秋季和本县城关小学的一个女教师结了婚。不到三个月，汉川县文教科就调她到乡下去。虽然经过龙庸修的一再动员说服，她还是不肯去。后来，龙庸修考虑既然她不愿去，而且城关小学也需要教师，就向领导上要求是否可以不调她去。结果是人调走了，龙庸修还在党的小组会上受到了批评，说他是“个人主义”“自私自利”“享乐主义”……等等，并说党员不应该有这种要求。
    陕西大荔县管池乡共产党员帖忠孝，一贯积极工作，曾经几次被评选为县的优抚、治安模范，受过四五次奖励。现在他是县的党代表、农业生产合作社的监察主任。因为他整天忙于为群众办事，他家住的房子早就漏了，一直未修。今年春天房子不修实在不行了，儿子也复员回家要娶媳妇。因此，他决定修一下。但是他家生活比较困难，修建房子钱不够用。他三次向党支部申请帮助他向信用社贷点款，每次都遭到拒绝，支部书记马温堂批评他说：“一个共产党员，不积极要求干工作，却给私人办起事情来了，没这号钱给你贷。”和乡长王允中谈了四次，也不给解决。逼得他没法 只好向富农借钱来修房子。
  类似这样的情况还不少：某个党员要求离职报考高等学校；某些妇女党员因孩子拖累，影响了工作和身体，要求机关举办托儿组织……等等，都被目为“个人主义”“只看到个人利益，不服从党和国家的利益”！因为，在某些党组织的领导者眼中看来，党员就不应该有个人要求，提出个人要求必是“个人主义”无疑。在领导者们的这种奇怪的“逻辑”下，谁还敢甘冒“不韪”去提出个人的意见和要求呢？
    党员究竟应不应该有个人要求？是不是一提出个人要求就是“个人主义”？我们说，党员可以有个人要求，也必然会有个人要求。而且为了求得问题的解决，党员的个人要求也可以向党组织提出来。因为党员虽然是工人阶级的先锋战士，比一般群众的觉悟程度高，但是党员也和一般群众一样，是一个生活在现实社会中的人！既然是人，他就不可避免地要有和一般人一样的个人要求：要求有适当的工作，要求夫妻团聚，要求学习深造，要求解决他的衣、食、住、行的问题，要求解决抚养孩子的问题……。但是，这些问题的解决，往往是党员个人力所不能及的，必须依靠组织才能解决。因此，党员向党组织提出自己的个人要求，是“理所当然”的事。而某些党组织对所有提出个人要求的党员，不分青红皂白，一律扣上“个人主义”的帽子，是十分错误的。
    刘少奇同志在“论共产党员的修养”一书中早就告诉我们：“虽然在党的一般利益中包括着党员个人利益，但总还不能完全包括，还不能也不应消灭党员的个性。党员总还有一部分私人的问题须要自己来处理，并且也还得要根据他的个性与特长来发展他自己。因此，党是允许党员在不违背党的利益之范围内去建立他个人的以至家庭的生活，去发展他个人的个性与特长。……党也在可能条件下顾全与保护党员个人的不可缺少的利益——如给他以教育学习的机会，解决他的疾病与家庭问题……。这是党的负责人在处理党员问题时所必须注意的。”
    由此可见，像前面所说的那些党员的个人利益：临时工要求转成正式工；夫妻要求调在一起工作；妇女干部要求机关举办托儿组织……等等，都是正当合理的，党是应该注意加以解决的。对党员的这些个人利益解决得好，非但不会损害党的集体利益，相反，由于党员积极性的提高，会更加巩固党的集体利益。我们某些党组织的领导者，所以要给提出这种要求的党员扣上一顶“个人主义”的帽子，有的是对这些问题没有正确认识，也有的是借维护“党的利益”之名而掩护自己不关心群众疾苦的“官僚主义”。
    当然，如果一个党员时时刻刻以个人利益为重，斤斤计较于个人的利益，向党闹地位、闹待遇，无休止地要求党满足自己的一切愿望和要求；当个人的利益和党的利益发生矛盾的时候，不愿放弃个人的利益而服从党的利益……等等。这当然是“个人主义”。但是，作为党组织来说，即使对待这样的党员所提出的个人要求（我们今天确实还有这样的党员），也不应该只是简单粗暴地给他戴上一顶“个人主义”的帽子就算了事，而是应该耐心地对他进行教育和批评，使之在认识提高的基础上，自觉地放弃不正当的个人利益而服从党的利益。
    总之，不论何时，我们的党组织，只有在不妨碍党的利益的原则下，适当地照顾了党员的个人利益，满足了党员的正当要求，才能进一步地发挥党员的积极性，调动一切积极因素为党的事业服务。漠视党员个人利益，就会损害党员的积极性，归根结底还是损害了党的利益。
