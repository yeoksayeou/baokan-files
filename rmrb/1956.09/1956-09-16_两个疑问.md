    Two Questions
    Deng Youmei
    Shut up in the office for too long, last year I suddenly plunged into the heat of the struggle and felt deaf and blind. Facing many problems, I couldn't analyze them clearly, so I had to be cautious in my words and actions, and think twice about everything. After more than a year of this, some phenomena have become clearer, and I feel compelled to speak out.
    A used concrete mixer in 80% condition costs only five or six thousand yuan, but renting one from a state rental department costs more than fifteen yuan a day. The rental fee for more than a year is enough to buy one, so who wouldn't want to buy? But the leadership says, "The state has a large number of machines piling up with no one using them, so only renting is allowed, not buying. This is the rule!" Someone suggested, "Since the state has a large number of machines piling up, why not lower the rental price? This would encourage mechanization and prevent the machines from deteriorating." But the leadership says, "This is also the rule. The rule has already been set, and we only have the obligation to obey it, not the need to make suggestions!" As a result, the rule is obeyed, but the production departments have to continue using manual mixing to reduce costs, and large numbers of machines still lie in warehouses, mildewing and rusting! Documents calling for the use of machinery are still being issued constantly.
    What does the word "rule" mean in the minds of some leaders?
    The original design for a certain central government office building called for glazed tile roofs, dougong brackets, palace lanterns… When it was halfway built, it coincided with the high tide of the anti-waste campaign, so the owner's representative had an emergency talk with the site director:
    Owner: "The glazed tile roof is not needed, the dougong brackets are not needed, the palace lanterns are not needed!"
    Site Director: "It won't work. The glazed tiles have been bought, the dougong brackets have been made, the palace lanterns have been bought."
    Owner: "It doesn't matter, we'll pay the same amount, as long as they aren't installed. Isn't this an anti-waste campaign?"
    Now, that building is already full of people, but because of "anti-waste," the roof is still bare, as if it hasn't been completed. As for those glazed tiles, some are used to prop up table legs, some have become bullets for slingshots to shoot birds, and the remaining parts are still piled randomly on the side of the road at the construction site. Apart from the children who want to use them as toys, no one pays attention to such a pile of "waste." Because the owner completed the "anti-waste" task, and the construction site also completed the task of handing over profits.
    What does the phrase "anti-waste" mean in the minds of some leaders?

    两个疑问
    邓友梅
    在机关里关得久了，去年猛然投进火热的斗争中，觉得自己又聋又瞎。面对着许多问题分析不出个所以然来，只好谨言慎行，凡事三思。这样过了一年多，有些现象看得比较清楚，我不得不发言了。
    买一部八成新的混凝土搅拌机不过五六千元，而向国家出租部门租一部，每天的租费却需十五元多。一年多的租费就能买一架，谁不想买？可是领导上说：“国家积压着大批机器没人用，只许租不许买，这是制度！”有人提意见：“既是国家积压着大批机器，干吗不把租价降低些！一来鼓励机械化生产，二来免得机器放坏了。”可是领导上说：“这也是制度，制度已经定了，我们只有遵守的义务，没有提意见的必要！”结果，制度是遵守了，但生产部门为了降低成本只好仍用人工搅拌，大批机器仍旧躺在仓库里发霉、生锈！号召使用机械的文件还不断地往下发。
    “制度”二字在某些领导人的脑子里是什么含义呢？
    某中央机关办公大楼，原设计是琉璃瓦大屋顶、斗拱、宫灯……，盖到一半，正碰上反浪费高潮，业主代表就找工地主任进行了一次紧急谈话：
    业主：“琉璃瓦大屋顶不要了，斗拱不要了，宫灯不要了！”
    工地主任：“不行，琉璃瓦买来了，斗拱作好了，宫灯买来了。”
    业主：“不要紧，我们照样给钱，只要别装上就行，现在不是反浪费吗？”
    现在，那幢大楼早已住满了人，但因“反浪费”，屋顶却仍像没有盖完似的秃着，而那些琉璃瓦等等呢，有的垫了桌子腿，有的变成了用弹弓打鸟的子弹，残余部分还乱堆在工地的马路边上，除去想拿它作玩具的小孩子们，谁也不注意还有这么一堆“废物”。因为业主完成了“反浪费”任务、工地也完成了上交利润的任务。
    “反浪费”三字在某些领导人的脑子里是什么含义呢？
