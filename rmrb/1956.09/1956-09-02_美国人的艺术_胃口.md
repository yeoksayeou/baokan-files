    The American Artistic "Appetite"

    Recently, an American company invited a Thai classical dance troupe to perform in the United States. This company requested that Thailand make some modifications to the form of the classical dance to make it closer to American "art" in order to suit the American "appetite." This presented a difficult problem for Thai artists: what exactly is the American "art" that this American company refers to, and what is the American "appetite"?

    Smart people know they should take a look at the current state of the "art" market in America today.

    American detective novelist Frank Farrell boasted: "I am the author of crime stories and novels, and American radio and television stations constantly broadcast my works." This is a fact. He also said that more than sixty-five of the murder cases he wrote about were "written under the authorization and encouragement of the Federal Bureau of Investigation." Having obtained the authorization and encouragement of intelligence agencies, and the support of large enterprises, his "works" depicting murder became popular in the United States.

    Another commodity with strong sales is the "comic" comic books, which sell one billion copies annually. As American comic book expert Legman said: these comics are full of "scenes of beatings, shootings, strangulations, flying flesh and blood, and torture to death." According to the average national population in America, each person can be allocated six copies a year.

    American singer Bing Crosby's records have recently seen a sharp drop in sales. His strong competitors are a quintet of singers named Trachal, Kimka, Bill, Bass and Dolly. Who are these five "artists"? It turns out that Trachal and Kimka are sheepdogs, Bill and Bass are beagles, and Dolly is a poodle. In the eyes of American bosses, the barking of dogs is more stimulating to people's "appetite" than Bing Crosby's singing. Their business acumen is indeed good; Victory Records sold 500,000 copies of the "dog artists'" records in a few weeks.

    As for nude dances, hysterical music, and movies and television filled with pornography and murder, these are commonplace and need not be listed one by one.

    However, there is another kind of art that is increasingly out of sync with the American "appetite."

    Not long ago, American Democratic Senator Lehman submitted a report to Congress stating: "In large areas of the United States, there is currently no professional theater," "Opera houses are in a deplorable state, and currently only one or two permanent opera companies can maintain substantial performances. None of our country's larger cities have an opera house or a full-time opera company." "Due to the very limited performance opportunities in the United States today, only a handful of outstanding singers can hope to make a living by singing in opera houses." "Many young people with musical talent are currently forced to pursue other occupations." "The number of ballet troupes is also very limited, and these troupes almost always have to tour to survive."...

    Former US Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Kennan, also said this: there is a tendency in the United States to be "indifferent to one's own cultural life." "For example, we spend millions of dollars every year on horse racing and gambling, but our capital does not even have an opera house." Even such a knight of the American "free world" could not help but sigh: "There are very few countries in the world that disrespect artists, writers, composers, or thinkers as much as our country does."

    From this, it can be seen what the monopolistic capital has made of many Americans' "appetite", and to what extent the cause of pure music, dance, drama, and painting has been ruined in the United States.

    The Thai artists are shrewd, and they have touched the "art" market situation in the United States. Cherishing the national art tradition of their motherland, they believe that changing the form of Thai classical dance to suit this American "appetite" would render Thai art meaningless. Therefore, the Thai Department of Art refused the request of the American company and announced the cancellation of the plan to send a dance troupe to perform in the United States. (Fang)

### 美国人的艺术“胃口”

    美国人的艺术“胃口”
    最近，美国一家公司邀请泰国的古装舞蹈团到美国演出，这家公司要求泰国对古装舞蹈的形式作一些修改，使它更接近美国的“艺术”，以便符合美国人的“胃口”。这给泰国的艺术家出了一个难题：究竟什么是这家美国公司所谓的美国的“艺术”，什么是美国人的“胃口”？
    精明的人懂得应该摸一摸美国今天“艺术”市场的行情。
    美国侦探小说作家佛朗克·法瑞士曾自吹自擂地说：“我是犯罪故事和小说的作者，美国电台和电视站不断地转播我的作品。”这是事实。他又说，他所写的凶杀案有六十五件以上是“在联邦调查局的授意和鼓励下写作的”。既得到特务机关的授意和鼓励，又获得大企业的支持，于是他的描写杀人的“作品”就在美国脍炙人口了。
    另一种行情坚挺的货色是每年销行十亿册的“滑稽”连环画刊。如美国连环画专家勒格曼所说：在这些滑稽画里充满了“殴打、放枪、绞杀、血肉横飞、酷刑处死的画面”。这样的画刊，按美国全国人口平均计算，每人一年可分到六册。
    美国歌王平克劳斯贝的唱片近来销路一落千丈。他的劲敌是五重唱歌手，名叫崔查尔，金卡，比尔，巴丝和多利。这五位“艺术家”是谁？原来崔查尔和金卡是牧羊犬，比尔和巴丝是小猎犬，而多利却是只鬈毛犬。在美国大老板们看来，狗的狂吠比起平克劳斯贝的歌声更能够刺激人的“胃口”。他们的生意眼的确不错，胜利唱片公司在几星期内就卖出了五十万张“狗艺术家”们的唱片。
    至于裸体舞、歇斯底里的音乐、充满了色情和凶杀内容的电影和电视等等，这些是家常便饭，就不必一一列举了。
    但是，另外有一种艺术，却愈来愈对不上美国人的“胃口”。
    不久之前，美国民主党参议员利曼向国会提出的一份报告说：“在美国的大片大片地区，目前没有一家专业性的剧院，”“歌剧院正处于可悲的状态，目前只有一两个常设性的歌剧团可以维持相当的演出活动。在我们国家所有较大的城市中都没有歌剧院或者专职性的歌剧团。”“由于目前在美国演出机会非常有限，只有寥寥无几的杰出的歌唱家才可以指望靠着在歌剧院的演唱来维持生活。”“许多有音乐天才的青年人目前都不得不从事其他职业。”“芭蕾舞剧团的数目也很有限，这些剧团差不多要经常作巡回演出以维持生存。”……
    前美国驻苏大使凯南也这样说：在美国有一种“对待自己的文化生活漠不关心”的倾向。“例如，我们每年在赛马和赌博上要花费几百万美元，但是我们的首都却连一所歌剧院都没有。”连这样一位美国“自由世界”的骑士也不免叹息说：“世界上像我国这样不尊重艺术家、作家、作曲家或思想家的国家是很少的。”
    由此可见，垄断资本已经把许多美国人的“胃口”弄成一个什么样子，纯正的音乐、舞蹈、戏剧和绘画的事业在美国已被糟蹋到什么地步。
    泰国的艺术家是精明的，他们摸到了美国的“艺术”行情。怀着珍惜祖国的民族艺术传统的心情，他们认为改变泰国古装舞蹈的形式，以适合美国人的这种“胃口”，将使泰国的艺术失去意义。因此泰国艺术厅拒绝这家美国公司的要求，宣布取消派遣舞蹈团到美国去表演的计划。（芳）
