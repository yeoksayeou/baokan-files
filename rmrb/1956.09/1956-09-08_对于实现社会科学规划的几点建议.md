    Some Suggestions for Implementing Social Science Planning
    Wu Jingchao
    Regarding the long-term plan for social sciences, after the efforts of experts invited by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, a preliminary draft has now been formulated. This draft will certainly be supplemented and revised after discussions by academic circles in various regions. In any case, in the near future, this plan can be finalized, and social science workers across the country will have a long-term goal to strive for. However, like other long-term plans, the formulation of the social science long-term plan is only the beginning of the work. Whether the research atmosphere in China's social science community will become stronger in the future, and whether scientific research works will continue to emerge, still requires continuous efforts from all parties.
    First of all, we need to do some mobilization and organization work to get all social science workers to participate in this great undertaking. It is undeniable that some social science workers wrote many papers before liberation, and some even published monographs, but their names have not been seen in academic journals in recent years. Why have these people now retired? I think: some people have stopped writing for a long time because their Marxist-Leninist cultivation is not high, and they are afraid of making mistakes in writing articles; some people are afraid of being criticized for writing articles, which will damage their reputation. Some people say that after seven years of silence, their voices have become hoarse, and they can no longer take the stage; others say that they have written articles, but they lock them in a drawer after writing them, fearing that they will not be published if they are sent out. These are all concerns, and concerns like these must be eliminated. Relevant parties should vigorously carry out work to dispel concerns and inspire courage. This work is very meticulous, and a few large meetings will not solve the problem. It is hoped that the editorial departments of various newspapers and periodicals will promote this work from all aspects. They can organize and plan to visit these social science workers who have been silent for a long time, explain the policies to them, propose topics for them to study, and provide assistance and supervision in the process of research. After the papers are written, they can also help the authors gather some peer experts to provide opinions on the papers, supplement materials, help the authors improve the quality of the papers, and then publish them. I think that as long as the mobilization and organization work is done well, the enthusiasm and creativity of these old social scientists can still be brought into play. The purpose of doing this is to mobilize all forces that can be mobilized to advance towards social science.
    Secondly, in the field of social sciences, especially in the scope of economic science, there is a difficulty that must be solved in conducting research work, that is, the issue of actual data. Without actual data, scientific research cannot be carried out, just as "a clever woman cannot cook without rice." Without actual data as the basis for analysis and research, dogmatism cannot be eliminated; the pragmatic style of seeking truth from facts cannot be established; and the call for theory to be linked with practice cannot be realized. To solve this difficulty, I suggest starting from two aspects: First, all universities and colleges should systematically enter into mutual assistance contracts with business institutions and enterprises. When business institutions and enterprises encounter difficult problems in their work, whether they are technical or economic problems, they can submit them to universities and colleges for research and resolution; at the same time, universities and colleges can also use business institutions and enterprises as scientific bases to obtain the necessary data for research from them. The Soviet "Pravda" on October 24, 1955, published an advanced experience, that is, the Ural Industrial University cooperates with two hundred enterprises scattered in the Urals, Siberia, and other regions. The Ural Industrial University has forty professors and two hundred and thirty associate doctors, who can help enterprises solve difficult problems in their work, and can also conduct scientific research in these enterprises. This advanced experience is something our universities should learn from. Our universities and enterprise institutions are not without contact, but this kind of contact is not comprehensive enough or frequent enough. If our universities can cooperate with many business institutions and enterprises frequently, then all economic problems can obtain the necessary actual data as the basis for analysis. Moreover, since this kind of research starts from reality, the results of the research can make an effective contribution to our country's socialist construction. For example, in any of our departments, there are advanced enterprises and backward enterprises. If we can summarize the experience of these advanced enterprises and then promote it to the backward enterprises, so that the backward can catch up with the advanced, we can create more wealth for the country. This kind of work is of great significance, so it should be a key focus for social science workers to strive for. Second, universities and colleges can also cooperate with government agencies to conduct scientific research. Now our government agencies themselves are frequently conducting investigation and research work. For example, the State Planning Commission and the State Statistical Bureau, which have business ties with the Department of Economics of Renmin University of China, have long-term scientific research plans and have also put forward many research topics. If universities and colleges can cooperate with them on certain issues, then the issue of actual data will be easily resolved. Our government agencies have accumulated a lot of actual data over the years, which can be used as raw materials for analysis and research. Even if some data have not yet been collected, they can be collected on the spot through the opportunity to check the work. If social science workers in universities and colleges spend a few months each year participating in the work of government agencies, especially participating in the scientific research work of government agencies, I think it will be beneficial to both parties.
    Finally, I would like to talk about the issue of foreign materials. Since liberation, we have attached importance to learning from the Soviet Union, so books and magazines about the Soviet Union are relatively easy for us to see. This is of great help to us in learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. However, in the past few years, we have also become relatively unfamiliar with materials from capitalist countries. I feel that when everyone was carrying out self-transformation, it was necessary to temporarily put aside books and magazines from capitalist countries. However, after several years of studying Marxism-Leninism, we have been able to distinguish between the enemy and ourselves, and distinguish between right and wrong. At this time, when we read publications from capitalist countries again, not only will we not be poisoned, but it will also help our scientific advance. Now, when conducting scientific research, not only in the natural sciences, but also in the social sciences, we need to use materials from capitalist countries as a reference. Only by reading books and magazines from capitalist countries can we know their political and economic development, learn from their strengths in certain areas, and effectively fight against their anti-Marxist-Leninist ideas. However, there are many books and magazines published in capitalist countries. If many agencies and schools subscribe separately, it will not only lead to duplication, but it will also be difficult to have a complete collection. Therefore, the best way is to establish larger social science libraries in several major cities in China, with the state allocating sufficient foreign exchange to subscribe to important books and magazines from important countries in the socialist camp and capitalist countries such as Britain, the United States, France, and West Germany. People who are willing to study international political and economic issues, as well as those who want to do comparative research on a certain social science issue, can obtain the necessary reference materials in this library. After this method is implemented, the current problem of lack of foreign materials can be basically solved.

    对于实现社会科学规划的几点建议
    吴景超
    关于社会科学方面的长期规划，经过中国科学院所邀请的专家的努力，现在初稿已经制定出来了。这个初稿，将来经过各地学术界人士的讨论，一定还会有补充及修正的地方。无论如何，在最近期间内，这个规划就可以定稿，全国的社会科学工作者，从此就有一个长期奋斗的目标了。但是，和其他长期计划一样，社会科学长期规划的制定只是工作的开始。以后中国社会科学界的研究空气是否会浓厚起来；科学研究的作品，是否会不断出现，还需要各方面的不断努力。
    首先，我们还要作一些动员和组织的工作，使所有社会科学工作者，都来参加这一伟大的事业。不容否认，有一些社会科学工作者，在解放之前，是写过许多论文，甚至还有一些专著出版的，但这几年来，学术刊物中，已经看不见他们的名字。为什么这些人现在退隐了？我认为：有些人长久搁笔，是因为自己的马克思列宁主义修养不高，写文章怕犯错误；有些人怕写出文章来受到批评，有损自己的面子。有些人说，七年不鸣，嗓子倒了，现在已经上不了台；还有人说，文章我曾写过，但是写完了就往抽屉中一锁，怕送出去也登不出来。这都是一些顾虑，诸如此类的顾虑，必须加以清除。有关各方面，应当大力进行解除顾虑和激发勇气的工作。这一工作是很细致的，开几次大会，还解决不了问题。希望各报刊编辑部，从各方面来推动这一工作，他们可以有组织、有计划地去访问这些搁笔已久的社会科学工作者，向他们解释政策，提出要他们研究的题目，并在研究工作的进行中，予以资料的协助和督促。在论文写成之后，还可帮助作者约集一些同行的专家，对论文提供意见，补充资料，帮助作者提高论文的质量，然后予以发表。我想，只要动员、组织的工作做得好，这些老社会科学家的积极性和创造性还是可以发挥出来的。这样做，目的在动员一切可以动员的力量，来向社会科学进军。
    其次，在社会科学的园地中，特别是在经济科学的范围内，进行研究工作，有一个困难必须解决，那就是实际资料问题。没有实际资料，就不能进行科学研究，正如“巧妇难为无米之炊”。没有实际资料作为分析研究的根据，教条主义也就不能扫除；实事求是的朴实作风，也就难于树立；理论联系实际的号召，也难于实现。要解决这个困难，我建议从两方面着手：第一，各高等学校，应当有计划、有系统地与事业机关及企业单位订立互助合同。事业机关与企业单位在工作中遇到困难问题时，无论是技术问题或经济问题，都可以提交高等学校研究解决；同时，各高等学校也可以把事业机关与企业单位作为科学基地，从他们那儿获得研究问题所必需的资料。1955年10月24日的苏联“真理报”，登载了一个先进经验，就是乌拉尔工业大学和二百个分散在乌拉尔、西伯利亚以及其他各地区的企业单位进行合作。乌拉尔工业大学有四十位教授，二百三十位副博士，他们可以帮助企业解决工作上疑难的问题，同时也可以在这些企业里，进行科学的研究。这一先进经验，是我们的大学应当学习的。我们的大学和企业机关不是没有联系，但是这种联系还不够全面，不够经常。我们的大学如果经常的能够和很多的事业机关及企业单位合作，那么一切经济问题，都可以取得必需的实际资料，作为分析的根据。而且这种研究既是从实际出发，那么，研究的结果，就可以对我国的社会主义建设，作出有效的贡献。举个例子来说，我们现在任何部门内，都有先进的企业和落后的企业。我们如能把这些先进企业的经验总结出来，再向落后的企业去推广，使落后的赶上先进的，就可以为国家创造更多的财富。这种工作，意义是很大的，所以应该是社会科学工作者必须努力的一个重点。第二，各高等学校还可以和政府机关合作，进行科学研究。现在我们的政府机关，本身就经常进行着调查研究工作，例如与中国人民大学经济系有业务联系的国家计划委员会和国家统计局，就有长期的科学研究规划，也提出了好些研究的题目。如果高等学校，能够在某些问题上和他们进行合作，那么实际资料问题，也就容易解决了。我们的政府机关，历年来已经积累了许多实际资料，可以作为分析研究的原料。即使某些资料，现在还没有搜集起来，也可以通过检查工作的机会，就地搜集。高等学校的社会科学工作者，如果每年有几个月去参加政府机关的工作，特别是去参加政府机关的科学研究工作，我想对于两方面都是有好处的。
    最后，我想谈一下国外资料的问题。解放以来，我们重视学习苏联，因而关于苏联的书籍杂志，我们比较容易看得到。这对于我们学习苏联的先进经验，是有很大帮助的。但是在过去几年内，我们对于资本主义国家的材料，又比较荒疏了。我觉得当大家在进行自我改造的时候，把资本主义国家的书报杂志，暂时抛在一边，是有必要的。但是，经过几年来马克思列宁主义的学习，我们已能分清敌我，辨别是非，此时，我们再去看资本主义国家的刊物，不但不会中毒，而且对于我们的科学进军还有帮助。现在进行科学研究，不但在自然科学方面，就是在社会科学方面，我们也需要利用资本主义国家的材料作参考。我们只有阅读资本主义国家的书报杂志，才可以知道他们的政治经济发展情况，才可以学习到他们在某些方面的长处，才可以同他们的反马克思列宁主义思想进行有效的斗争。不过资本主义国家出版的书报杂志是很多的，如果由许多机关学校分头订阅，不仅会产生重复现象，而且也不易齐备。因此，最好的办法，是在中国的几个大城市中，设立规模较大的社会科学图书馆，由国家拨以充足的外汇，订阅社会主义阵营各重要国家和资本主义国家如英、美、法、西德等国的重要图书杂志。愿意研究国际政治经济问题的人，以及想对于某一社会科学的问题作比较研究的人，都可以在这一图书馆中，获得他们所必需的参考资料。这一办法实行后，目前缺乏国外资料的问题就可基本上解决了。
