Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: A new type of ophthalmic equipment using a sophisticated electric medical device for corneal transplantation is being manufactured by the joint state-private Shanghai Yu Zhenxing Dental Medical Equipment Factory. It was designed by Dr. Zheng Yiren of the Shanghai Railway Central Hospital.

This corneal transplant device is only about the size of a pen-style flashlight, with an internal motor about the size of a person's index finger. Once the motor is started, a small, round splitter head begins to work. The entire corneal transplant operation can be completed in a very short time.

Several other medical equipment factories in Shanghai are also manufacturing medical devices successfully researched by doctors. The fundus camera, successfully researched by Dr. Lu Daoyan of the hospital affiliated with Shanghai Second Medical College and Dr. Fang Chuncai of Southeast Hospital, can clearly photograph the internal structure of the patient's eye for doctors to use for pathological research and to determine the patient's condition. After the first one of these machines was manufactured in May by the joint state-private Shanghai Xin Ya Health Material Factory, the manufacture of the second one has now begun. Prior to this, Xin Ya Health Material Factory also completed the manufacturing of the lightweight corneal microscope designed by Dr. Zheng Yiren.

    几种新的医疗器械
    据新华社讯　用精巧的电动医疗器械移植角膜的一套新式眼科设备，正在公私合营上海裕震兴齿科医疗器械厂制造。这是上海铁路中心医院医生郑一仁设计的。
    这套角膜移植器只有钢笔式手电筒那样大，内部马达，大小和人的食指差不多。马达一开动，圆形的小分头就工作起来。在很短时间里，就能全部完成移植角膜手术。
    上海还有一些医疗器械厂正在制造医生们研究成功的医疗器械。上海第二医学院所属医院医生陆道炎和东南医院医生方椿才研究成功的眼底摄影机，可以清楚地拍出患者眼睛内部的结构，供医生进行病理研究和确定患者的病症。这种机器在今年5月由公私合营上海新亚卫生材料厂造出第一台后，现在又开始了第二台的制造工作。在此以前，新亚卫生材料厂还完成了郑一仁医生设计的轻便角膜显微镜的制造工作。
