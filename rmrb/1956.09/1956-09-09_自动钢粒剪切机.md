    Automatic Steel Grit Shearing Machine
    The Xi'an Mining Machinery Repair Factory recently successfully trial-produced an automatic steel grit shearing machine. Each operator can produce 40 to 50 kilograms of steel grit per day using one machine. The utilization rate of waste drill pipe reaches 95%, and the steel grit produced is uniform and of good quality. The creation of this machine can solve the problem of steel grit supply in geological exploration work. At the same time, because of its small size and relative portability, drilling teams can carry it with them and produce steel grit directly, avoiding the trouble of transporting waste drill pipe to the factory and then transporting the steel grit produced by the factory back to the drilling team.

    In the second half of last year, the Northwest Coalfield Geological Exploration Bureau learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and tried using steel grit instead of iron sand for drilling, which resulted in a 30% to 50% increase in work efficiency. (Li Qian)

    自动钢粒剪切机
    西安矿山机械修配厂最近试制成功一部自动钢粒剪切机。这种机器每天每人操作一部可以产钢粒四十至五十公斤，废钻杆利用率达95％，而且生产的钢粒均匀，质量很好。这种机器制成后，可以解决地质勘探工作中钢粒供应问题。同时，因为它的体积很小，比较轻便、钻探队随身携带，可以直接生产钢粒，能避免把废钻杆运到工厂再由工厂生产钢粒运回钻探队的麻烦。
    去年下半年，西北煤田地质勘探局学习苏联先进经验，试用钢粒代替铁砂钻进，结果提高工作效率30％至50％。　　　　　（李茜）
