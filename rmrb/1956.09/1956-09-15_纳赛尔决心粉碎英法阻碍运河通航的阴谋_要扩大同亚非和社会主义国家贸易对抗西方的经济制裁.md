Xinhua News Agency, September 14th dispatch from London: Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser, in an interview with Hugh Pilcher, a reporter from the British "Daily Herald," said, "We will ensure that the aim of withdrawing foreign pilots is not achieved."

    The "Daily Herald" published this interview on September 13th. Nasser said in the interview, "We can manage the canal. We will manage the canal."

    He said, "On Saturday (September 15th), the canal will remain open and unobstructed, everything as usual, and we will have more pilots."

    "Seventy Egyptian pilots, with the help of those foreigners who do not resign on Friday, will work day and night to allow forty ships to pass through the canal every twenty-four hours."

    Referring to the recent negotiations with the "Five-Nation Committee," he revealed, "Menzies came here and threatened me with economic measures and armed forces in Cyprus, demanding my unconditional surrender."

    Nasser said that Egypt has no plans to discriminate against British ships using the Suez Canal.

    "Eden says the canal is Britain's lifeline, but I will only stop your ships if I decide to wage war against Britain. But why would I decide to wage war against Britain?"

    He asked, "What circumstances might prompt me to decide to declare war on Britain? Why would we threaten your lifeline?"

    Nasser also talked about the Algerian issue. He said that French Foreign Minister Pineau "accused me of not keeping my promise, accusing me of training Algerians in Egypt to fight the French. But Algerians can train themselves."

    "I promised to invite them to negotiate a peaceful solution, so a secret delegation composed of two Frenchmen and two Algerians came here (Cairo) and negotiated for ten days. Then the two Frenchmen went to Paris and never returned."

    Nasser continued, "They want us to keep our mouths shut and not speak out when the Algerian people are being massacred, but we do not agree to do so."

    Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, September 14th: Egyptian President Nasser, in an interview with special reporters from the Polish "People's Tribune" and the Polish Press Agency on September 11th, said that since Egypt nationalized the Suez Canal Company, Western countries have been unwilling to negotiate on the basis that Egypt has the indisputable legal right to nationalize and manage the canal.

    Warsaw newspapers published this interview with President Nasser on September 13th, stating that at the beginning of the Cairo negotiations, he asked Menzies whether the Western proposals took into account Egypt's sovereignty in managing the canal, and what was the legal basis for the Western proposals. Menzies could not answer these questions.

    Nasser emphasized that Egypt considers the 1888 Convention to be the only international agreement on freedom of navigation and is prepared to conclude a similar new international agreement in this regard.

    Nasser stated that Egypt would not object to submitting the Suez Canal issue to the United Nations.

    Regarding the imminent departure of some Western national pilots, the Egyptian President commented that we now rely on our own strength and also on the assistance of those countries that are willing to engage in genuine international cooperation. He said that if necessary, Egypt will negotiate, for example, to request Poland to send the necessary experts to work.

    In response to questions about Western countries imposing economic sanctions on Egypt, Nasser said that for three years, Egypt has been striving to free itself from its one-sided ties with the West. To this end, Egypt has now accumulated more than 60 million Egyptian pounds in gold reserves. In addition, Egypt is expanding its trade relations with Bandung countries and socialist countries. Egypt is also increasingly abolishing the use of pound sterling for settlement in international transactions. To reduce foreign exchange expenditures, Egypt has imposed restrictions on the import of luxury goods. The Egyptian government is drafting current and long-term economic development plans.

    Nasser announced that approximately 50% of the Suez Canal's revenue would be used to build the Aswan Dam. He pointed out that this would ensure that Egypt would not be subject to any political or economic conditions due to accepting foreign aid in the construction of the dam.

    纳赛尔决心粉碎英法阻碍运河通航的阴谋
    要扩大同亚非和社会主义国家贸易对抗西方的经济制裁
    据新华社14日讯　伦敦消息：埃及总统阿卜杜勒·纳赛尔在接见英国“每日先驱报”记者休·皮契尔的时候说，“我们将使撤回外国领航员一举的目的不能达到”。
     “每日先驱报”9月13日刊载了这篇谈话。纳赛尔在谈话中说，“我们能够管理运河。我们要管理运河”。
    他说，“星期六（9月15日），运河仍将畅通无阻，一切如常，而且，我们将会有更多的领航员”。
     “七十个埃及领航员，在星期五不离职的外国人的帮助下，将日夜工作，以使每二十四小时内有四十艘船通过运河。”
    谈到最近同“五国委员会”的谈判时，他揭露“孟席斯来到这里，并且，以经济措施和塞浦路斯的武装力量相威胁，要我无条件投降”。
    纳赛尔说，埃及并没有任何对使用苏彝士运河的英国船只加以歧视的计划。
     “艾登说运河是英国的生命线，但是，只有在我决定对英国作战的时候，我才制止你们的船只。但是，我为什么要决定对英国作战呢？”
    他问道，“什么情况可能促使我决定对英宣战？为什么我们要来威胁你们的生活线呢？”
    纳赛尔还谈到阿尔及利亚问题。他说，法国外交部长比诺“指责我不遵守诺言，指责我在埃及训练阿尔及利亚人来同法国人作战。但是阿尔及利亚人能够训练他们自己。
     “我答应请他们谈判一项和平解决办法，因此由两名法国人和两名阿尔及利亚人组成的秘密代表团来到了这里（开罗），并且商谈了十天。然后这两个法国人去巴黎，并且永远没有回来”。
    纳赛尔继续说，“他们要我们在阿尔及利亚人民遭受屠杀的时候闭起嘴来不说话，但是我们不同意这样做”。
    据新华社华沙14日电　埃及总统纳赛尔在9月11日对波兰“人民论坛报”和波兰通讯社特派记者发表谈话说，从埃及把苏彝士运河公司收归国有的时候起，西方国家就不愿在埃及有无可争辩的合法权利来把运河国有化和管理这条运河的基础上举行谈判。
    华沙报纸在9月13日发表的纳赛尔总统的这篇谈话说，在开罗谈判开始的时候，他曾经问孟席斯，西方的建议是否考虑到了埃及管理运河的主权，西方的建议所依据的法律基础到底是什么。孟席斯都答复不了这些问题。
    纳赛尔着重指出，埃及认为1888年公约是唯一关于通航自由的国际协定，并且准备在这方面缔结一个类似的新的国际协定。
    纳赛尔表示，埃及不会反对把苏彝士运河问题提交联合国。
    埃及总统就一些西方国籍的引水员即将离职一事发表意见说，我们现在依靠我们自己的力量，也依靠愿意进行真正的国际合作的那些国家的援助。他说，如果必要，埃及将进行交涉，例如请波兰派遣必要的专家来工作。
    纳赛尔在回答关于西方国家对埃及实行经济制裁的问题时说，三年来，埃及就在努力争取使自己摆脱对西方的一面倒的联系。为此，埃及现在积存了六千多万埃镑的黄金储备。此外，埃及正在扩大同万隆国家和社会主义国家的贸易关系。埃及也正在愈来愈多地取消用英镑在国际交易中结帐。为了减少外汇，埃及对奢侈品的进口实行了限制。埃及政府正在草拟目前的和长期的经济发展计划。
    纳赛尔宣布，将把50％左右的苏彝士运河的收入用于修建阿斯旺水坝。他指出，这样将使埃及在修建水坝问题上不致由于接受外国援助而受到任何政治或经济条件的约束。
