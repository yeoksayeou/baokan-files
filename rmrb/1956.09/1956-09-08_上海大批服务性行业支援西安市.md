    Xi'an City's joint state-private operated catering service store building has been completed and will open successively in mid-September. This building was constructed for catering service stores relocating from Shanghai to Xi'an. Currently, over 180 employees and their families from twelve enterprises in Shanghai, including the joint state-private operated Dongya Restaurant, Wanguo Barber Shop, Dahua Tailor Shop, and Xianghai Photo Studio, have arrived in Xi'an one after another. Among these employees are famous chefs, barbers, and laundry workers from Shanghai. Shortly after their arrival in Xi'an, they began to work intensively on decorating the business premises and installing various equipment. At the same time, some employees were also selected to go to Xi'an's existing catering, barber, laundry, and clothing stores to exchange experiences and understand the local people's living habits, so that they can better serve the people of Xi'an after the opening.

    上海大批服务性行业支援西安市
    本报讯　西安市公私合营饮食服务商店大楼已经建成，9月中旬即可陆续开业。这个大楼是为由上海迁入西安的饮食服务商店建筑的。目前，上海公私合营东亚大饭店、万国理发馆、大华西服店、香海照像馆等十二个企业的一百八十多名从业人员和他们的家属，已先后到达西安。这批从业人员中，有上海著名的厨师、理发师和洗染师。他们到达西安不久，就开始紧张地布置营业室，安装各种设备，同时，还抽调部分职工到西安市现有的饮食、理发、洗染和服装店交流经验，了解本地人民的生活习惯，以便开业后更好地为西安人民服务。
