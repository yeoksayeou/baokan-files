    Maltsev's Advanced Farming Method Defeats Years of Severe Drought
    Soviet Kurgan Oblast's "Lenin's Legacy" Farm Achieves Another Bumper Harvest
    (Our correspondent from Kurgan, 21st) Although continuous severe drought frequently threatens the land of the Shadrinsk region, the "Lenin's Legacy" Collective Farm in Kurgan Oblast has continued to achieve its fifth year of bumper harvests this year. Thanks to the adoption of the advanced farming methods of the farm's scholar, Maltsev, the farm has maintained a yield of around 20 quintals per hectare for several years. In contrast, other collective farms in Kurgan Oblast, which used old methods, have yields of less than 10 quintals per hectare, and some farms can only harvest three or four quintals per hectare. Currently, Maltsev's advanced farming method has achieved good results in the Urals, Altai, Siberia, Ukraine, and many other parts of the Soviet Union. When the reporter visited the "Lenin's Legacy" Collective Farm, Maltsev, the farm's scholar and Honorary Academician of the All-Union Lenin Academy of Agricultural Sciences, emphasized: "Our method certainly cannot be applied rigidly; but if every place can act according to its specific circumstances and make nature serve itself, we will definitely be able to continuously achieve more bumper harvests!"

    马尔采夫先进耕作法战胜连年苦旱
    苏联库尔干州“列宁遗训”农庄又获丰收
    本报库尔干21日电　虽然是连年的苦旱经常威胁着夏德林斯克区的土地，但是库尔干州“列宁遗训”集体农庄今年还是继续获得了第五年的丰收。这个农庄由于采用了农庄的学者马尔采夫的先进耕作法，几年来每公顷土地的收获量一直保持在二十公担上下，而采用旧办法耕作的库尔干州其他集体农庄每公顷土地的收获量还不到十公担，有的农庄每公顷只能收获三、四公担。目前马尔采夫的先进耕作法已经在乌拉尔、阿尔泰、西伯利亚和乌克兰以及苏联其他许多地方收到了很好的效果。记者在访问“列宁遗训”集体农庄的时候，农庄学者、全苏列宁农业科学院荣誉院士马尔采夫强调说：“我们的方法当然不能生搬硬套；但如果每一个地方都能根据自己的具体情况办事，使自然为自己服务，我们一定就可以连年不断地取得更多的丰收！”
