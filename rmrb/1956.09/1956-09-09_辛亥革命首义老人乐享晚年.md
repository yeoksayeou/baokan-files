It has been more than forty years since the first shot of the Xinhai Revolution rang out in Wuchang. The young people who participated in the Wuchang Uprising are now all over sixty years old.

Many people are very concerned about the later years of these revolutionary elders, especially the current living conditions of the lower-level people among the revolutionary elders. With the same feeling, the reporter specially visited Mr. Hu Lianxi, who is 79 years old. He was an ordinary soldier in the Wuchang Uprising. He retired from the army after being injured in the uprising and is now living at home in his old age.

Residents living near the Wuchang Uprising Park are very familiar with the name of Mr. Hu Lianxi. When asked about his residence, a middle-aged woman pointed us and said: "Have you seen the Wuchang Uprising Memorial Arch? The two red-roofed tile houses to the west of the memorial arch are the old man's home. The old man has a daughter, son-in-law, and grandson, and the family is very harmonious."

We walked into the old man's bedroom. The old man turned over and got up from the bed, asked us to sit down, and asked someone to bring tea. The old man's movements seemed still very steady. He was wearing a neat blue cloth jacket and trousers and wearing a pair of dark glasses. After we explained our intentions, the old man talked about his situation back then.

　　"Look, this hand was lost in a battle of the Xinhai Revolution." He raised his disabled left arm for us to see, and then said: "Before the Xinhai Year, I worked as a shop assistant and had contact with revolutionary secret organizations. During the first uprising, I served as a deputy head (equivalent to the current squad leader) under Huang Xing, the commander-in-chief during the war. In October, we and the Qing soldiers fought for several small hills in the Shiliupu area of Hanyang. I led dozens of brothers to attack the enemy's position. The position was taken, and my left hand was also seriously injured." Speaking of this, the old man took out the "Certificate of Revolutionary Disabled Soldier" specially issued by the People's Government for us to see. It recorded the old man's injury and indicated that the old man was a Second Class B disabled person. The grids for receiving relief money on the certificate of revolutionary disabled soldier have been filled in seven times, indicating that he has received relief money for revolutionary disabled soldiers for three and a half years.

Speaking of the old man's life after his injury, the old man said with emotion: "Participating in the war back then was originally to make the country rich and strong and the people happy. Who knew that I lost my left hand in the war, and our wishes were not realized in the old society. Later, I spent most of my life running around and working hard, but I still lived a life of half-hunger and half-satisfaction. Four children died of illness. I was already disabled, and after decades of hard work, my health has been greatly affected.

When the conversation turned to the People's Government's care for him, he said excitedly: "I didn't expect to have such a comfortable and happy old age. The People's Government takes care of us in every possible way. The People's Government is really thoughtful for me. Not to mention the 190 yuan of relief money I receive every year, even the two public houses I live in are specially treated, and only half the rent is charged. Every winter, the government also sends me a new set of cotton clothes." The old man said that he has never worn old cotton clothes since liberation. During the New Year and festivals, the government also sends New Year and festival subsidies.

Now the old man is very healthy, his eyes are not blurred, his ears are not deaf, he does not need a cane to walk, and his voice is also very clear. He took out his public medical card and said to us: "The government issued this card to me more than three years ago, and I haven't used it even once." Many friends who used to work with the old man often come to visit him. They like to gather in the small teahouse diagonally opposite the old man's residence to drink tea, chat, and play chess. The old man said that the government has solved the problem of life, and his son-in-law and daughter take care of the housework. Except for taking special care of his little grandson, there is nothing else for me to worry about.

The conversation lasted for more than three hours. We were afraid of overworking the old man, so we said goodbye. Before leaving, the old man told us to tell those who care about him about his living conditions. He said: "I am very grateful to the government and those who care about me. I can't do more for the country! But I want to live a few more years and hope to see your young generation build Wuhan, the site of the Xinhai Uprising, into a beautiful garden!"

    辛亥革命首义老人乐享晚年
    新华社记者　徐士杰　孙玉昌
    从辛亥革命在武昌响起了起义的第一枪起，到现在已有四十多年了。当年参加武昌首次起义的年轻人，现在都已经是年过花甲的老人了。
    许多人很关心这些首义老人的晚年生活，特别关心首义老人中的下层人士现在的生活情况。记者怀着同样的心情，特地拜访了七十九岁高龄的胡濂溪老先生，他是武昌首义的一个普通士兵，起义以后负伤退伍，现在家中养老。
    住在武昌首义公园附近的居民都很熟悉胡濂溪老先生的名字。问起他的住处，一个中年妇人向我们指引说：“看见武昌首义纪念坊了么？纪念坊西边的两间红顶瓦屋就是老先生的家。老人有女儿、女婿、外孙，一家人很和睦。”
    我们走进老人的卧室，老人就翻身从床上起来，让我们坐，叫人端茶。老人的举动看来还很稳健，他穿着整洁的青洋布裤褂，带着一副墨色眼镜。听我们说明来意以后，老人就谈起了他当年的情况。
      “看，这支手就是在辛亥革命的一场争夺战中失去的。”他举起残废的左臂叫我们看，接着说：“辛亥年以前，我作店员，曾和革命的秘密组织联系。首义时，我在战时总司令黄兴的部下当副目（相当现在的班长），10月间，我们和清兵争夺汉阳十里铺一带的几个小山头，我率领几十个兄弟攻进敌人的阵地，阵地打下来了，我的左手也负了重伤。”说到这里，老人拿出了人民政府特别发给的“革命残废军人证明书”让我们看，上面记载着老人的负伤情况，并标明老人是二等乙级残废。革命残废军人证明书上领救济金的格子已经填写了七个，说明他领革命残废军人救济金有三年半了。
    提起老人负伤以后的生活，老人感伤地说：“当年参加战争，原来是想使国家富强，人民康乐，谁知在战争中失去了左手，而我们的愿望在旧社会里也没有实现。以后，我的大半生终年奔波劳碌，但是仍然过着半饥半饱的日子。四个孩子都因病死亡了。我本来就残废，经过这几十年的操劳，健康状况受到很大影响。
    当谈话转移到人民政府对他的照顾情况时，他兴奋地说：“我没有想到还有这样安逸幸福的晚年，人民政府对我们的照顾是无微不至的。人民政府替我想得真是周到，不说每年发给我一百九十元救济金，连我住的这两间公房，也特别优待，只按半价收租。每年冬天，政府还送我一套新棉衣。”老人说他从解放以来，没有再穿过破旧的棉衣。逢年过节，政府还送来年节补助费。
    现在老人的身体很健壮，眼不花、耳不聋，走路不扶手杖，说话的声音也非常清晰，他拿出公费医疗证对我们说：“这个证政府发给我三年多了，连一次也没有用过。”许多和老人当年同事的朋友，常来看望他，他们爱聚首在老人住所斜对门的小茶馆里喝茶、谈天、下棋。老人说，生活问题政府给解决了，家务事有女婿和女儿管，除了对小外孙要特别照顾之外，再没有任何事情要我操心了。
    谈话持续了三个多钟头，我们怕过分劳累老人就告辞了。临别时，老人叮咛我们，要把他的生活情况告诉那些关心他的人。他说：“我很感谢政府和关心我的人，我已经不能为国家作更多的事了！但我要多活几年，希望能看到你们年青一代把辛亥首义的地点——武汉建成美丽的花园！”
