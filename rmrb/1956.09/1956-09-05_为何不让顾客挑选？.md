    Why Not Let Customers Choose?
    One day, the weather was exceptionally hot and stuffy. In the department store of the Sanyuan County Department Store in Shaanxi Province, there were three customers who were sweating profusely from walking a long distance. After carefully examining a sewing machine displayed in the department store, they asked the salesperson, "Comrade, are there any more sewing machines?" "Please show us a few so we can choose one." The salesperson impatiently said, "They are all the same, what is there to choose?" He refused the customers' request. One customer repeatedly pleaded, "I don't know much about the goods. I specifically asked two garment workers to help me choose one. Don't make them waste their time for nothing." The salesperson remained unmoved, insisting, "I don't care about your situation. Buy this one if you like it, otherwise forget it." The three customers had no choice but to leave the department store angrily, complaining, "What 'answer all questions patiently, never tire of showing'?!"

    为何不让顾客挑选？
    一天，天气格外闷热。在陕西省三原县百货公司门市部里，有三个因跑了很多路而热得满头大汗的顾客。他们仔细地看过了摆在门市部里的一架缝纫机后就问售货员：“同志，还有缝纫机吗？”“请拿出几架给我们挑选一架。”售货员很不耐烦地说：“都是一样的货，有什么挑头。”不答应顾客的要求。有一位顾客再三恳求说：“我不懂得货，专门请了两位缝衣工人帮我挑一挑，不要害他们也白耽误时间。”那位售货员仍无动于衷，坚持说：“不管你那一套，看上这一架就买，看不上就拉倒。”这三位顾客最后只得很气愤地跑出了门市部，嘴里责备着：“什么百问不烦，百拿不厌。”
