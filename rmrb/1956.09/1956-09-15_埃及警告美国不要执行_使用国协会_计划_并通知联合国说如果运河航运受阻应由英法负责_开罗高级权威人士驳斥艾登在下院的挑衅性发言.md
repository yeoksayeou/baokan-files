Xinhua News Agency, September 14th, Washington: Egyptian Ambassador to the United States, Ahmed Hussein, warned U.S. Secretary of State Dulles on September 13th that if Western countries implement the "Suez Canal Users' Association" plan, it would mean war.

    The Egyptian Embassy issued a statement on the 13th regarding this matter, saying: "Ambassador Ahmed Hussein, under the instructions of the Egyptian government, met with Secretary of State Dulles at a few minutes before eleven o'clock this morning and conveyed the following urgent telegram: The plan that Eden wants to force on Egypt is an open and blatant violation of Egyptian sovereignty, and its implementation means war.
     "If the United States wants war, then it can support this plan, but if it wants to strive for a peaceful solution, then this plan must be abandoned."

Xinhua News Agency, September 14th, Cairo: An Egyptian Foreign Ministry spokesman announced that Egyptian Representative to the United Nations, Omar Lutfi, under the instructions of the Egyptian government, notified the United Nations on September 13th that any obstacles to navigation in the Suez Canal caused by the threatened withdrawal of foreign pilots and technicians should be the responsibility of Britain and France.

    Lutfi notified Secretary-General Hammarskjöld and all United Nations member states of the former Suez Canal Company's order for foreign employees to leave the canal zone on September 15th.

Xinhua News Agency, September 14th, Cairo, TASS: A communique issued by the Egyptian Foreign Ministry in Cairo today stated: "The Egyptian government declares that, regardless of all conspiracies to sabotage the navigation of the Suez Canal, the Egyptian government continues to take measures to ensure the continued navigation of the Suez Canal in the future. However, if the navigation of the canal is interrupted due to reasons beyond the control of the Egyptian government, then the responsibility will fall on those who instigated the matter."

Xinhua News Agency, September 14th, Cairo: A senior Egyptian authority, in a statement on the evening of September 12th, refuted British Prime Minister Eden's speech in the British House of Commons that day, and pointed out that Eden's plan for Britain, France, and the United States to establish a Suez Canal "Users' Association" was a provocative act.

    The senior official denounced Eden's claim that Britain and France faced the threat of military action, and pointed out that it was Britain and France who had dispatched troops to pose a threat.

    He said: "Our response to Eden's statement that Egypt continues to reject a peaceful solution is: Egypt seeks nothing other than peace." He pointed out that Egypt had suggested the establishment of a negotiating body, and said: "Egypt does not reject a peaceful solution, but rejects the forced implementation of a system that takes over the canal for the benefit of certain countries." He challenged Eden to point out the clause that made the former Suez Canal Company a party to the 1888 Constantinople Convention, and said that Article 14 stipulated the continued undertaking of obligations after the expiration of the canal company's concession, which refuted Eden's statement.

    He added that Article 16 of the original concession law stipulated that the former canal company was Egyptian—not international.

    In refuting Eden, he also pointed out that not only the Soviet Union, but also India, Ceylon, and Indonesia had proposed excluding the canal from international control.

    He questioned Eden, asking if the claim that Egypt preventing the so-called "Users' Association" would be a violation of the 1888 Convention, "on what article of the treaty, on what point of international law, does he rely for support"?

    Regarding Eden's statement that foreign personnel were being forced to work, the official replied that Egypt had stated more than once that foreign personnel could leave their jobs according to normal procedures if they did not wish to continue working.

    Regarding the claim of Egypt using force, the official asked if Eden could point to where Egypt had used force to endanger world peace.

    埃及警告美国不要执行“使用国协会”计划
    并通知联合国说如果运河航运受阻应由英法负责
    开罗高级权威人士驳斥艾登在下院的挑衅性发言
    新华社14日讯　华盛顿消息：埃及驻美国大使艾哈迈德·侯赛尼9月13日警告美国国务卿杜勒斯说，如果西方国家执行“苏彝士运河使用国协会”计划，这就意味着战争。
    埃及大使馆13日就这件事发表声明说：“艾哈迈德·侯赛尼大使奉埃及政府之命在今天上午差几分钟到十一时的时候会见了国务卿杜勒斯，并转达了下述紧急的电报：艾登要强迫埃及接受的计划是对埃及主权的公开和露骨的侵犯，它的执行意味着战争。
     “如果美国希望战争，那么它可以支持这个计划，但是，如果它希望为和平解决而努力，那么，这个计划必须放弃”。
    据新华社14日讯　开罗消息：埃及外交部发言人宣布，埃及驻联合国代表欧默尔·劳特菲9月13日奉埃及政府指示通知联合国：由于外国领航员和技术员所威胁要实行的撤退而造成苏彝士运河航行方面的任何障碍，都应当由英国和法国负责。
    劳特菲把前苏彝士运河公司命令外籍职员在9月15日离开运河区工作一事通知了秘书长哈马舍尔德以及各联合国会员国。
    新华社14日讯　塔斯社开罗14日讯：埃及外交部今天在开罗发表的公报说：“埃及政府声明，埃及政府方面不顾一切破坏苏彝士运河通航的阴谋，继续采取措施来保证苏彝士运河今后的通航。但是，如果一旦由于不取决于埃及政府的原因，运河的通航陷于中断，那么责任要落在怂恿此事的人身上。”
    据新华社14日讯　开罗消息：埃及一位高级权威人士9月12日晚发表谈话驳斥了英国首相艾登当天在英国下院的发言，他并且指出，艾登提出的英法美三国建立苏彝士运河“使用国协会”的计划是一种挑衅行为。
    这位高级人士斥责艾登所说的英国和法国面临着武力行动威胁的说法，他指出正是英国和法国调遣了军队进行威胁。
    他说：“我们对艾登所说的埃及继续拒绝和平解决的话的回答是：除了和平之外，埃及不企求任何其他的东西。”他指出，埃及已经建议成立一个谈判机构，他说：“埃及并不拒绝和平解决，但是拒绝强迫实行这样一种制度：为了某些国家的利益而把运河接收过去”。他叫艾登指出把前苏彝士运河公司作为1888年君士坦丁堡公约当事人一方的条款来，他并且说，第十四条规定在运河公司租借权期满后继续承担义务，这就否定了艾登的说法。
    他又说，原租借法第十六条规定，前运河公司是埃及的——不是国际的。
    他在驳斥艾登的时候还指出，不仅苏联，而且还有印度、锡兰和印度尼西亚都提出了排除运河由国际控制的建议。
    他质问艾登，如果埃及阻止所谓“使用国协会”将是违反1888年公约的说法，“是根据条约中那一条，他靠国际法的那一条作为支持”？
    对于艾登说外籍人员被强迫工作这一点，这位人士回答说，埃及不只说过一次，外籍人员可以按照一般手续离职，如果他们不愿意继续工作的话。
    关于埃及使用武力的说法，这位人士问道，艾登可不可以指出埃及在什么地方使用过武力来危害世界和平。
