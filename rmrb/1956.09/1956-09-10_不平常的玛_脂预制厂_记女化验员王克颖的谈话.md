    The Unusual Asphaltum Prefab Factory
    ——A Conversation with Female Lab Technician Wang Keqing
  　Our Correspondent Liu Heng
    (Continued from yesterday)
    I Became a "Youth Shock Worker"
    I suddenly understood: Why wasn't I enthusiastic about my work in the office before? It was because I didn't consider myself the master of my work, and I didn't understand the significance of my work.
    After coming to the asphaltum prefab factory, I also changed day by day.
    Before, I felt dizzy when I saw numbers. Now? For example, when I test the softening point of asphaltum, if I find the softening point is seventy degrees, I immediately think: this number is too small. If the asphaltum melts at seventy degrees, won't the roof leak stinky oil when exposed to the sun in summer? Thus, "seventy degrees" is not just a dry number, but contains important information such as whether the asphaltum is qualified and whether it can be used for construction on the roof. Gradually, my interest in numbers grew, and I also became interested in my laboratory. Comrades are all praising me: "Little Wang is really capable, sitting in the lab all day!" "Little Wang is so careful, she doesn't get a single number wrong!" But my personality – it hasn't changed!
    One day, it was Saturday. We ran out of Anshan asphalt, and the materials department only delivered a batch of Shijingshan asphalt in the afternoon.
    Shijingshan asphalt is different from Anshan asphalt, and the first batch of asphalt that arrives is also different from the later batches. Every time a batch of asphalt arrives, we have to test it to find out the mixing ratio of the asphalt and other raw materials. Therefore, Zhu Shoufu said to me: "Little Wang, we have to work overtime tomorrow..."
    At that moment, my mind went "buzz": "Oh no, isn't the company holding a sports meet tomorrow? I signed up for the race and grenade throwing. And the person I like is also participating in the race, weightlifting, and high jump. I can't miss it."
    Zhu Shoufu seemed to guess my thoughts and said: "I know there is a sports competition tomorrow. But for the sake of work, I have to ask you to sacrifice yourself. Because if we don't find the right mixing ratio tomorrow, the workers will have to stop working the day after tomorrow."
    Immediately, I remembered what Shi Wenli had said. That was when I had just been transferred to this factory. Shi Wenli saw me, reached out his big hand, and grabbed my hand. He said: "Kid, the lab technician is the eye of science. It's great that you're here! Your work is very important to us! We can only mix the materials, get the pot ready, and trial-produce prefab blocks after you've done your tests. Your working hours are within our working hours. Your work contributes to the factory being able to go into production early." At the time, I didn't pay attention to these words, and I thought I had forgotten them all. Who knew that I hadn't forgotten them; they were hidden in a corner of my heart. At this critical moment, it jumped out from that corner of my heart. I said to Zhu Shoufu: "Okay, I'll come tomorrow."
    At night, I lay in bed thinking of tricks. I had been thinking about this trick for several days, but I hadn't tested it yet. That is – the asphaltum is over a hundred degrees after it is cooked. We have to wait one or two hours for the sample to cool down before we can test it. I thought: If we ice the sample with cold water, wouldn't it only take ten minutes or so to cool down? But, would doing this change the softening point of the asphaltum? This question can only be solved by testing.
    The next morning, I went to the factory early. I heated the asphaltum. I took a small piece of sample and iced it in cold water, and took a small piece and put it on the table to let it cool down on its own. The result – it was so exciting, their softening points were both eighty-five degrees!
    By the time Zhu Shoufu arrived with several workers, my experiment had already succeeded. When Zhu Shoufu saw me, he looked like he had found a treasure, and shouted from afar: "Oh, you're here! I've been looking for you everywhere; I thought you weren't coming!"
    Normally, I would have retorted: "You just think you're proactive, and you see everyone else as backward!" But today, I just smiled and didn't say anything, because I had a secret.
    This day, our testing work proceeded especially quickly. However, I still felt it was too slow. Whenever I had free time, I would help the workers stoke the fire, weigh the materials, carry the baskets, watch the furnace, and measure the temperature. I ran in and out, busy as a bee, deliberately not allowing myself any free time. Because I knew that if I had any free time, my heart would run off to the stadium.
    At eleven o'clock, all our testing work was completed. This meant that tomorrow morning, the workers could start production as usual, without having to stop work. I threw down my work clothes, threw down my gloves, and ran off. Zhu Shoufu shouted from behind: "Your pen fell! Your pen fell!" I didn't bother to pick it up. Because I knew that if I didn't pick it up, someone would pick it up for me anyway, and it wouldn't be lost. But what about time? Once you delay, it slips away, and no one can catch it back! I ran, I ran, I ran on the plain, I felt like I wasn't running, but flying! I thought that at this speed, if I participated in the 100-meter race, I would definitely win a prize.
    Afterwards, the comrades elected me as a "Youth Shock Worker."
    The Biggest Rationalization Proposal
    After the asphaltum test was qualified, it was time to trial-produce prefab blocks.
    In the yard, several large iron barrels were lined up in a row. The steaming asphaltum lay inside, like barrels of jet-black paint.
    The workers said: "This is our factory's new product, we have to make the prefab blocks look the best." What would be the best-looking appearance? Everyone had different opinions and had been arguing for days.
    Li Zizhou said: "I want to make it into an iron cake, so that it can spin around on the ground." He found a washbasin and poured the asphaltum into it. Who knew that once the asphaltum cooled, it stuck to the basin and couldn't be poured out. Li Zizhou had to sigh, put the washbasin on the fire, melt the iron cake, and then pour it out.
    Liu Xubin said: "I want to make it majestic and square, so that people will think it's a big iron plate from afar." He found a few wooden sticks and made a large rectangle, with a large piece of tinplate underneath. He poured the asphaltum in, poured in one barrel, not enough, and poured in another barrel to fill the wooden frame. Several hours later, the iron plate was made. It took several people to lift it, and they still couldn't lift it. Everyone shouted: "How can we transport such a bulky thing to the site?" Everyone propped one end of the iron plate on the ground, raised the other end, and pushed it forward. The iron plate somersaulted, fell to the ground, and shattered into pieces.
    Later, everyone decided to find a few small wooden frames to make the asphaltum into small rectangles. However, after the asphaltum was poured in and cooled, it couldn't be demolded. Everyone was sweating profusely.
    The captain, section chief, and branch secretary kept running over to encourage them: "The trial production of new products cannot be successful in one or two attempts, you have to try seven or eight times, ten, dozens of times." "Don't be discouraged, everyone, think again, think again."
    My brain twitched a few times, and I said: "First, apply talcum powder around the wooden frame, and then pour in the asphaltum. Talcum powder is slippery, so once the asphaltum cools, can't it slide out?"
    Everyone tried it, and the prefab blocks slid out. Everyone was extremely happy and prepared to pour another one. Zhu Shoufu rushed over and stopped them: "No, no! The composition of asphaltum is fixed. Now, a layer of talcum powder has been stuck around the prefab blocks. Will its composition change when it is cooked on site later?"
    Suddenly, foreman Liu Yonghui ran over excitedly. He held a dripping wet wooden frame in one hand and a dripping wet prefab block in the other, shouting: "Success! Success! This is water demolding! Water demolding!" People surrounded him.
    After a while, he walked up to me and said: "Little Wang, my water demolding was inspired by your talcum powder. I thought, isn't water also slippery? I put the wooden frame with asphaltum in water, it cools down quickly and demolds immediately."
    I looked around in the crowd for Zhu Shoufu, wanting to tell him what Foreman Liu had said. However, I couldn't find him in the crowd. It turned out that he was writing a manuscript in the laboratory. He wrote:
    "A new type of factory designed and built by the working class themselves – the Asphaltum Prefab Factory – has been established in the Baotou industrial base. The first batch of new products manufactured by this factory – asphaltum prefab blocks – will be transported to various construction sites tomorrow and meet everyone.
      "In the process of building the factory, the workers and technicians of this factory have displayed a high degree of labor enthusiasm and used collective wisdom to propose more than 30 rationalization proposals, ensuring the smooth construction of the factory and putting it into production ahead of schedule. Therefore, it can be said that this factory is a factory built with rationalization proposals.
      "The significance of the establishment of this factory is very important. The fact that this factory has been successfully established itself puts forward the biggest rationalization proposal to the whole country, that is – it is recommended that asphalt production areas across the country also establish asphaltum prefab factories to supply asphaltum prefab blocks to all parts of the country instead of asphalt. Because asphalt is very toxic, and transport workers are prone to asphalt poisoning accidents. After asphalt is made into asphaltum prefab blocks, the toxicity is reduced, which can reduce or even eliminate poisoning accidents for transport workers."
    Half an hour later, the female announcer at the construction site was speaking in a pleasant voice, and the entire construction site could hear about our asphaltum prefab factory.　(The End)

    不平常的玛?脂预制厂
    ——记女化验员王克颖的谈话
  　本报记者　刘衡
    （续昨）
    我变成“青年突击手”
    我突然明白过来了：为什么我以前在办公室里，工作不起劲呢？也是因为我没有作自己工作的主人，我不懂得我工作的意义。
    来到玛?脂预制厂后，我也一天一天在变了。
    以前，我看见数目字，有些头昏眼花。现在呢？比方我试验玛?脂的软化点。我找到软化点是七十度，立刻我就想到：这个数目字太小了，玛?脂到了七十度就要化，夏天被太阳一晒，房顶不是要流臭油吗？于是“七十度”就不是枯燥的数目字，而是包含着玛?脂合不合格、能不能在房顶上施工等重要内容了。慢慢，我对数目字的兴趣越来越大了，也就对我的化验室有兴趣了。同志们都在夸我：“小王真行，在化验室一坐一天！”“小王心真细，数目字一个也弄不错！”可是我的性格呢——并没有变！
    有一天，是星期六。我们把鞍山沥青用光了，材料科才在下午运来了一批石景山沥青。
    石景山沥青跟鞍山沥青是不一样的，头一批来的沥青同后一批来的也不一样。来一批沥青，我们就要化验一次，找出沥青跟其他原料的配合比来。因此，朱守甫对我说：“小王，我们明天要加一天班……”
    当时我脑子里一“嗡”：“哎呀，明天公司里不是要开体育大会吗？我报名参加了赛跑、扔手榴弹。还有那个我喜欢的人也参加了赛跑、举重、跳高，我不能不去看。”
    朱守甫好像猜透了我的心思，说：“我知道明天有体育比赛。可是为了工作，不得不要求你牺牲一下自己。因为如果我们明天不找好配合比，后天工人上班，不得不停工。”
    立刻，我想起史文礼讲的话来了。那还是在我刚刚调进这个工厂的时候。史文礼见了我，伸出大手一把捏住我的手。他说：“小孩，化验员是科学的眼睛，你来得真好！你的工作同我们关系太大了！要等你化验好了，我们才能配料，才能出锅，才能试制预制块。你的工作时间就在我们工作时间之内，我们工厂能够提早投入生产，也有你一份功劳。”当时，我听了这话，毫不注意，我以为我早把这话全都忘记了。谁知道，我并没有忘记它，它就藏在我心的某个角落里。在今天这个紧要关头，它就从我心的那个角落里钻出来了。我对朱守甫说：“好吧，我明天来。”
    晚上，我睡在床上想窍门儿。这个窍门儿我已经想过好几天了，只是没有试验过。就是——玛?脂熬好后，有一百多度。我们取出样品，要等一两个钟头，等它晾冷，才能进行化验。我想：如果我们用凉水把样品冰一冰，不是只要十来分钟，就可以冷了吗？可是，这样做，会不会使玛?脂的软化点发生变化呢？这个问题只有用试验才能解决。
    第二天一大早，我就去工厂了。我把玛?脂烧热。取一小块样品冰在凉水里，取一小块放在桌子上，让它自己变冷。结果——真叫人高兴死啦，它们的软化点都是八十五度！
    等朱守甫带着几个工人赶来，我的试验已经成功了。朱守甫看见我，就像看见什么宝贝一样，老远就叫：“呀，原来你在这里！我到处找你，我以为你不来了！”
    要在平时，我一定要顶他：“你光以为自己积极，把别人都看成落后分子！”可是，今天，我只笑了笑，没有说什么，因为我有秘密。
    这一天，我们的化验工作进行得特别快。可是，我还嫌它太慢。一有空，我就去帮工人烧火、称料、抬筐子、看炉子、测温度。我跑进跑出，忙得团团转，我故意不让我自己有一点闲空儿。因为我知道，要是我有一点闲空儿，我的心就要跑进体育场去了。
    十一点钟，我们的化验工作全部完成了。这就是说，明天一早，工人们可以照常生产，用不着停工了。我扔下我的工作服，扔下我的手套，抬脚就跑。朱守甫在后边叫：‘钢笔掉了！钢笔掉了！”我也顾不上捡。因为我知道，我不捡，总会有人替我捡起来，反正丢不了。可是时间呢？你一耽搁，它就溜过去了，谁也捉不回来！我跑啊，跑啊，在平原上跑啊，我觉得我不是在跑，而是在腾空飞！我想，要照这个速度参加一百公尺赛跑，一定可以得奖。
    以后，同志们选我当了“青年突击手”。
    一个最大的合理化建议
    玛?脂化验合格后，要试制预制块了。
    院子里，一溜齐的摆着几个大铁桶。热腾腾的玛?脂躺在里面，就像一桶桶乌黑乌黑的油漆。
    工人们说：“这是咱们工厂的新出品，咱们要给预制块弄个最好看的样儿。”究竟什么才是个最好看的样儿呢？大伙儿意见不一致，已经吵吵几天了。
    李子洲说：“我要把它弄成个铁饼，让它能够在地上滴溜溜地打转转。”他找来一个脸盆，把玛?脂倒进去。谁知道，玛?脂一冷，粘在盆里倒不出来了。李子洲只好叹口气，把脸盆放在火上，把铁饼烤化，再倒出来。
    刘绪斌说：“我要把它做得威威武武，方方正正的，让人远远一看，以为是块大铁板。”他找来几根木棍子，围成一个大长方形，下边衬上一大块白铁板。他把玛?脂倒进去，倒了一桶，不够，又倒一桶，才把木框填满。几个钟头后，铁板做出来了。好几个人去抬，还抬不动。大伙儿嚷嚷开了：“这么笨的家伙，怎么往现场运？”大伙儿把铁板的一头支在地上，另一头抬高，往前用劲一推，铁板翻个跟斗，掉在地上，跌了个粉碎。
    以后大家决定找几个小小的木头框子，把玛?脂做成个小小的长方形。可是，玛?脂倒进去，变冷后，怎么也不能脱模。大伙儿都急得头上直冒汗。
    队长、段长、支部书记不住的跑来打气：“新产品的试制不是一次、两次就能成功的，要试制七次、八次、十几、几十次。”“大伙儿别泄气，再想一想，想一想。”
    我脑子动了几动，我说：“先在木头框子周围涂上滑石粉，再倒玛?脂。滑石粉有滑性，玛?脂一冷，不是就可以滑出来了吗？”
    大伙儿一试验，果然预制块滑出来了。大伙儿高兴极了，准备再倒一块。朱守甫赶来一把拦住：“不行，不行！玛?脂的成分是有一定的。现在，在预制块的周围又粘上了一层滑石粉。以后在现场熬制，它的成分岂不是会起变化？”
    忽然，工长刘永惠兴冲冲地跑来了。他一手拿了个水淋淋的木头框框，一手拿了个水淋淋的预制块，大喊大叫：“成功了！成功了！这是水脱模！水脱模！”人们都把他围起来了。
    一会儿，他走到我跟前，对我说：“小王，我这个水脱模是受了你那个滑石粉的启发。我想，水不是也有滑性吗？我把木头框子装上玛?脂，泡在水里，它冷得很快，一下子就脱模了。”
    我在人群里到处找朱守甫，想把刘工长讲的话告诉他。可是，人群里怎么也找不到他了。原来他在化验室里写稿子。他写：
    “一个新型的、由工人阶级自己设计、自己建筑的工厂——玛?脂预制厂，已经在包头工业基地建立起来了。这个厂制造的第一批新产品——玛?脂预制块，明天就可以运送到各个建筑工地，和大家见面。
      “在建厂过程中，这个厂的工人们和技术人员们发挥了高度的劳动热情，并且运用了集体的智慧，提出了三十几条合理化建议，保证了工厂的顺利建成，并且提前投入生产。因此，可以说，这个工厂是一个用合理化建议建成的工厂。
      “这个工厂建立的意义是十分重大的。这个工厂建立成功了的事实，本身就向全国提出了一个最大的合理化建议，就是——建议全国各地沥青产地也来建立玛?脂预制厂，以玛?脂预制块代替沥青来供应全国各地。因为沥青的毒性很大，搬运工人容易发生沥青中毒事故。沥青制造成玛?脂预制块后，毒性就小了，就可以减少甚至消灭搬运工人的中毒事故。”
    半个钟头后，工地女广播员用好听的声音在讲话了，整个工地都听见了我们的玛?脂预制厂。　（完）
