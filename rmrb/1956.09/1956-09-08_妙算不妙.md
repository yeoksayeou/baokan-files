Title: Clever Calculation, Not So Clever

Like in the past, Washington has recently launched a round of noise about the Soviet Union testing nuclear weapons.

Washington has always been particularly sensitive to this matter. Before the Soviet Union even had time to announce the test, Washington was already clamoring about it, and the White House was the one releasing the news.

The U.S. Atomic Energy Commission said that this announcement by the U.S. government was the "thirteenth time." Indeed, every such test makes the U.S. atomic maniacs nervous. The Soviet Union's record of these nuclear weapon tests not only shattered the so-called nuclear "superiority" upon which the U.S. government's "position of strength" policy relied, but has also left the United States far behind in this regard.

This time, the Soviet Union's test, due to its advanced technology, has made Washington feel nervous once again. The International News Service alone twice reported on Washington insiders' speculation that the Soviet Union's "new explosive may be an improved hydrogen bomb that can be used as a warhead for missiles crossing the ocean"; one U.S. "atomic authority" even more definitely said: "This Soviet weapon is designed as a warhead for intermediate-range rockets of 1,500 miles," which will "endanger U.S. overseas bases." These manifestations of unease are not accidental. U.S. military strategists know that the Soviet Union has moved ahead of the United States in this new military science, and it is precisely this obvious fact that makes them desperately angry.

However, the advocates of the U.S. "position of strength" policy certainly would not want to do propaganda that "diminishes one's own prestige and enhances the ambition of others." There is an ulterior motive behind their release of this news. According to a Kyodo News Agency correspondent in New York, the White House's clever calculations in announcing the Soviet nuclear weapon test are threefold: first, "anti-Soviet propaganda." The United States has been condemned worldwide for testing nuclear weapons in the Pacific, and this time it wants to "not miss a good opportunity to launch a counterattack"; second, "election tactics." The Democratic presidential candidate has repeatedly used voters' demands to advocate for a halt to nuclear weapon testing, and this position "has deeply penetrated the hearts of the American people"; now the Republican Party, the master of the White House, wants to win back popular support; third, "warning India," because "India and neutral countries in Asia are resentful of the U.S. nuclear weapon tests on Bikini Atoll."

The U.S. President's remarks prove that the White House has indeed placed a bet on this. He wants to prove that the Soviet Union's testing of nuclear weapons seems to contradict the Soviet Union's consistent advocacy of banning nuclear weapons and stopping these weapon tests. If people are naive enough to believe everything Washington says, then Washington's clever calculations will be realized. However, anyone with a minimum of thinking ability will not think that this is a valid logic. One cannot wait to be beaten, this is the simplest truth. The United States surrounds the Soviet Union with its various military blocs and military bases, openly plans atomic war strategies with the Soviet Union as its enemy, and uses more and more money to develop new weapons with huge destructive power. At the same time, it has so far resolutely refused to undertake the obligation to ban nuclear weapons. If the Soviet Union does not want to be beaten because of backwardness, it must also develop atomic weapons, improve them, and test them.

The U.S. government's emphasis that the Soviet Union's nuclear weapon tests are not announced in advance like the United States does not improve the U.S. position in any way. What the public in various countries cares about is when the United States will be willing to accept the Soviet Union's proposal to ban atomic weapons and stop these weapon tests. The United States wants to make them believe that the Soviet Union's proposal to ban atomic weapons is insincere, but people naturally want to ask, since this is the case, why doesn't the United States dare to accept it? Why doesn't the United States even dare to touch the proposal to stop nuclear weapon testing?

The U.S. government argues that the United States is not unwilling to stop nuclear weapon testing, but that there must be international supervision. However, such a defense has long been bankrupt. Scientists have pointed out that modern technical tools can detect nuclear weapon tests anywhere in the world. The fact that the U.S. authorities so accurately described the Soviet Union's nuclear weapon test, even the size of the test, proves that banning nuclear weapon tests does not require any monitoring system at all. The United States emphasizes the need to establish supervision first, but it just wants to use a requirement that is obviously impossible to agree on to resist the requirement to ban nuclear weapon testing. However, the United States' clinging to the so-called supervision issue and using it to resist all demands regarding the prohibition of the use, production, and testing of atomic weapons will never bring it blind followers as Washington has calculated, but will only expose the surprising extent to which U.S. diplomacy has become outdated and rigid. It is futile to try to distort the Soviet Union's position with noise in order to salvage its isolated position.

    妙算不妙
  　非昔
    像在过去一样，最近华盛顿又发动了一阵关于苏联试验核子武器的噪嚷。
    华盛顿对这件事一直是特别敏感的。苏联自己还来不及公布试验的情况，华盛顿就已嚷开了，而且由白宫来公布这些消息。
    美国原子能委员会说，这次美国政府的公布是“第十三次”了。的确，每一次这样的试验，都使美国的原子狂人们神经一阵紧张。苏联这些核子武器试验的记录，不仅粉碎了美国政府“实力地位”政策所依恃的所谓核子“优势”，而且已经在这方面把美国远远地抛在后面了。
    这一次苏联的试验，由于它在技术方面的先进，使华盛顿又一次感到神经紧张。单是国际新闻社就两次报道了华盛顿人士的推测，认为苏联“这一种新的爆炸物可能是一种经过改进的氢弹，可以当作横越大洋的导弹的弹头使用”；美国一位“原子权威人士”甚至更肯定地说：“苏联这种武器是为了作为一千五百英里中射程火箭的弹头”，它将“危及美国海外基地”。这些不安的表现，不是偶然的，美国的军事战略策划人们知道，苏联在这门新的军事科学方面已走在美国的前面，而正是这种明显的事实使他们陷入绝望的恼怒之中。
    但是，美国的“实力地位”政策鼓吹者们当然决不会愿意做“灭自己的威风，长他人的志气”的宣传的。他们公布这种消息别有用心。据共同社驻纽约记者的报道，白宫公布苏联试验核子武器的妙算有三：一、是“反苏宣传”。美国在太平洋试验核子武器受到举世谴责，这次想“不错过良机而转入反攻”；二、是“选举战术”，民主党总统候选人一再利用了选民的要求，主张停止核子武器试验，这个主张“已经深入美国人心”；现在白宫的主人共和党想把人心争取过来；三、“警告印度”，因为“印度和亚洲的中立国家对美国在比基尼岛试验核子武器有反感”。
    美国总统的谈话，证明了白宫的确在这上面押了赌注。他想证明：苏联试验核子武器似乎同苏联一贯主张禁止核子武器和停止这些武器试验是矛盾的。如果人们都天真到相信华盛顿所说的一切，那么华盛顿的妙算就会实现了。但是，只要有起码的思考能力的人，就不会认为这是能够成立的逻辑。一个人不能等着挨打，这是最简单不过的道理。美国以它的各种军事集团和军事基地包围着苏联，直言不讳地以苏联为敌对对象策划着原子战争的战略，并且以愈来愈多的钱用于发展拥有巨大毁灭力的新武器，同时迄今坚决不肯同意承担禁止核子武器的义务，苏联要不准备因为落后而挨打，就不能不也要发展原子武器，改进它和试验它。
    美国政府强调，苏联试验核子武器不像美国那样事先宣布，这丝毫不能使美国的地位得到些什么改善。各国公众所关心的是美国什么时候愿意接受苏联关于禁止原子武器和停止这些武器试验的建议。美国想使他们相信苏联禁止原子武器的建议是没有诚意的，但人们自然地要问，既然如此，为什么美国不敢接受它呢？为什么连停止核子武器试验的建议美国也不敢碰一下呢？
    美国政府申辩说：美国不是不愿停止核子武器试验，而是要有国际监督。但是，这样的辩解也早已破产了。科学家们指出，现代技术工具能够侦察出在世界任何地方的核子武器试验。美国当局如此确切地道出苏联试验核子武器的情况，甚至试验规模的大小，这不是正好证明，禁止试验核子武器，是根本用不着任何监督制度的。美国强调要先建立监督，不过是想用这样一个显然不可能取得协议的要求来抵挡禁止试验核子武器的要求。但是，美国这样死抱住所谓监督问题，用它来抵挡一切关于禁止原子武器的使用、生产和试验的要求，决不可能像华盛顿所盘算的那样给它带来盲目的追随者，而只能暴露出美国外交的过时和僵硬已达到了怎样惊人的程度。想凭噪嚷，歪曲苏联的立场，来解救自己的孤立地位是徒然的。
