    The Fishing Season Arrives
    Our gunboat docked at the pier. From the deck, I saw the sailors' club on shore packed with young men and women, who were busy decorating the club beautifully. I thought it was for a dance or a joint performance. Suddenly, I spotted a red banner in a female comrade's hand, with the clear words: "The fishing season has arrived, strive for a bumper harvest!" More and more sailors gathered on deck, and soon we learned that those young men and women were from the Zhoushan Fisheries Headquarters.
    These days, there were many fishing boats anchored in the harbor. I couldn't immediately distinguish the types, but from a rough observation, there were at least four kinds. Along the naval pier to the right, the sailing boat anchorage was almost completely filled with fishing boats. On the harbor's surface, five or more fishing boats were lined up in straight rows. A large fishing trawler brought by the Fisheries Headquarters was mixed in with the sailing boats and hard to distinguish without paying attention. From a distance, the fishing boats in the harbor looked like dense swarms of ants, forcing any merchant ship entering the harbor to navigate like a snake.
    That night, ×× Port in the Zhoushan Islands was particularly lively. The power plant supplied electricity to the seaside all night, and the fishing boats in the harbor were adorned with electric lights. The sound of machine motors and the creaking of oars from the sailing boats blended together. It turned out that many fishing boats were returning laden with large yellow croakers. Workers at the fish processing plant were busy transferring the large yellow croakers from the boats to the shore; several motorized sailing boats were so loaded with large yellow croakers that their decks were close to the water surface. These boats were heading to Shanghai, Ningbo, and other places.
    As the sailing boats passed our gunboat's port side in formation, I turned on the masthead light on the bridge. The captains realized that our light was specially for them, and while rowing, they waved to us, laughing loudly and saying something. I only heard one sentence: "This is great, thank you, sailor comrades."
    This masthead light, shining brightly all around, did not go out until dawn the next day. That night, the harbor's sea surface was sleepless.
    Forty Days of Escorting Fishing at Sea
    I heard that the main fishing grounds were around Dongfushan and Miaozi Lake. Tens of thousands of fishing boats gathered there in batches. A few days ago, our gunboats had already prepared sufficient fresh water, green vegetables, dried salted vegetables, and food, waiting for the order to sail out to escort the fishing fleet. On this particular evening, as the tide rose, the fishermen busied themselves pushing all the fishing boats stranded on the mudflats into the water, and the groups of fishing boats in the harbor raised their white sails, ready to set out to sea. Our gunboats received the order: set sail with the fishing boats. Countless boats formed neat rows, closely following the gunboats on both sides, and we sailed towards the fishing grounds together.
    Dongfushan is about thirty nautical miles from Shenjiamen, facing the open sea. In the past, piracy was rampant here, and fishing boats were often robbed. Although the pirates have now been eliminated, our gunboats still patrol the dozens of nautical miles around the fishing grounds day and night to ensure safety and prevent any accidents.
    Dongfushan Island is close to the open ocean, and even a slight breeze can cause surprisingly large waves. When the wind reaches force five or six, the waves can rise several meters high. We were often lifted high by the waves and then thrown into the troughs. Several times, our foredecks were submerged in the waves, and the sailors standing lookout on the deck were half-submerged in water. Even so, we continued to brave the wind and waves, patrolling the distant sea.
    Large yellow croaker, ribbonfish...various fishing seasons came one after another. When we passed the fishing boats, the fishermen often greeted us affectionately. We would shout, "Captain, how's the fishing?" They would often raise fresh, live fish and cheer in response. Seeing the fishermen's bountiful harvest, we were unspeakably happy.
    The dried salted vegetables we brought to sea were eaten up, and the fresh water was used up. We should have returned to port long ago to replenish supplies, but in order to complete the task of escorting the fishing fleet during the fishing season, we continued to stay at sea day and night. Sometimes, when the fishermen heard that we sailors had no vegetables to eat, they would row their boats over with all their might and throw large, fresh fish onto our deck. Before we could even pay them, their boats would sail away.
    One day, the gunboat temporarily docked at Liuheng Island. I took a basket ashore to buy vegetables. Most of the island's residents were fishermen's families. As soon as the women saw that we were sailors, without saying a word, they ran home, brought out eggs and vegetables, and filled the basket to the brim. Some even brought out a hen that was laying eggs, insisting that we take it to the boat. It took a lot of talking to get them to accept the money. They continued to see me off to the seaside from a distance.
    When we went to the island to find spring water to drink, the fishermen's families were always eager to find us buckets and carrying poles, helping us carry water to the boat; sometimes they used small sampans to transport water to the boat. The fishermen's enthusiasm strengthened the sense of responsibility of every sailor. Although we had not returned to port for forty days, no one on the boat complained, and our morale remained high and cheerful. On the way back to port at the end of the fishing season, everyone spontaneously began singing our favorite sailor song, "Returning from a Long Voyage."

    海上生活片断
    轮机班长　郑世全
    鱼汛期到了
    我们的炮艇靠码头了，从甲板上，看到岸上的水兵俱乐部里挤满了许多男女青年，他们正在给俱乐部作精彩布置。我以为是举行舞会或者举行联欢演出。突然从一位女同志的手里发现一张红色标语，上面的大字看得很清楚：“鱼汛期到了，为鱼汛丰收而努力！”甲板上，水兵越聚越多，一会儿，我们才知道那些青年男女都是从舟山渔业指挥部来的。
    这几天港口停泊的渔船特别多，我很难一下分清渔船的种类，但粗略观察，起码有四种以上。沿着海军码头向右，只要是帆船停泊区，差不多全挤满了渔船。港口的海面上，渔船都五只以上摆成笔直的队列，渔业指挥部带来的一艘大渔轮，杂在帆船中间，不注意就很难识别出来。远远望去，港口的渔船像密密层层的蚂蚁，任何商船进港，非得像水蛇一样弯弯曲曲开行不可。
    这夜，舟山群岛的××港特别热闹，发电厂整夜向海边供电，港口的渔船上都悬挂了电灯。机器的马达声，帆船的摇橹声响成一片。原来这是许多渔船满载着大黄鱼归来了。渔业加工厂的工人们忙着将船上的大黄鱼转运到岸上；几只机帆船被满载的大黄鱼压得甲板接近水面。这些船只正往上海、宁波等地开去。
    当帆船成队地绕过我们炮艇的左舷时，我打开驾驶台的桅顶灯。船老大们发现我们的灯是特意为他们照明，他们一边摇橹，一边向我们招手，高声笑着、说着些什么，我只听见一句：“这样太好了，谢谢你们，水兵同志。”
    这盏照得四周雪亮的桅顶灯，一直到第二天拂晓才熄灭。这一夜，港口的海面都在不眠中。
    海上护渔四十天
    听说大渔场在东福山和庙子湖一带。成千上万只渔船，一批一批云集到那里去。几天前，我们几只炮艇就已经准备好充足的淡水、青菜、干咸菜、食粮，随时等待着出航护渔的命令。这天晚上涨潮的时候，渔民们忙着把搁在泥滩上的所有渔船推下水，港内成群的渔船也张起了白帆篷准备出海。我们几只炮艇接到命令：和渔船同时出海。数不清的船只排成整齐的队列，紧贴着炮艇的左右，我们同向渔场驶进。
    东福山距沈家门约三十浬，它面对着大海。过去有一个时期这里的海盗很猖獗，渔船常受到抢劫。现在虽然海盗消灭了，但我们的炮艇为了保护渔场安全，仍日夜巡逻在几十浬的渔场周围，以防任何意外。
    东福山岛，靠近外洋，稍有小风，海浪就很惊人。刮到五、六级风，浪涛掀起几丈高，我们经常时而被浪高高抬起，时而又被抛到浪涡里。有几次，我们的前甲板都埋在浪涛里，站在甲板上了望的水兵，半截身子都浸在水里。就这样，我们仍然抗着风浪直奔遥远的海面巡逻。
    大黄鱼、带鱼……各种鱼汛相继而来。当我们经过渔船时，渔民们常常亲昵地和我们招呼，我们高声问：“老大，鱼打得怎样了？”他们常常举起活鲜的大鱼，向我们欢呼作回答。看到渔民丰收，我们有说不出的高兴。
    我们带来海上的干咸菜吃光了，淡水用完了。我们本来早该返航补足给养，但为了完成鱼汛期的护渔任务，我们仍照常日夜在海上。有时渔民们听说我们水兵没有菜吃了，便使劲划船过来，拣又大又鲜的鱼往甲板上掷，我们还来不及给钱，船就开走了。
    有一天，炮艇临时停泊在六横岛。我提着篮子到岸上买菜。岛上住的多是渔民家属，妇女们一看到是水兵，就二话不说，跑回家去，拿出鸡蛋、青菜，把篮子装得满满的。有的把正在下蛋的母鸡也抱来，非让带到艇上去不可。费了很多唇舌，她们才留下钱。她们又远远地一直把我送到海边。
    我们到岛上找泉水吃，渔民家属也总热情地给我们找水桶、扁担，帮我们往艇上担水；有时用小舢舨装水往艇上运。渔民们的热情，更加强了我们每个水兵的责任感。虽然我们四十天没有返航，但艇上没有一个人叫过苦，我们的情绪始终饱满，愉快。在鱼汛结束，我们返航的途中，大家不约而同地唱起我们水兵最喜爱的歌曲“远航归来”。
