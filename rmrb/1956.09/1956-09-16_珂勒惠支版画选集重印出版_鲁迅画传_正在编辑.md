    Käthe Kollwitz Print Collection to be Republished
    "Illustrated Biography of Lu Xun" is Being Edited
    (Our report) The "Selected Prints of Käthe Kollwitz," compiled by Lu Xun before his death, will soon be republished by the People's Fine Arts Publishing House. This album was compiled and printed by Lu Xun at his own expense in 1936. The original edition was a folio, collotype printed on fine Xuan paper, with a very small print run, and has long been out of print. This republication will be done using offset printing on woodfree printing paper. The People's Fine Arts Publishing House plans to systematically republish all the picture albums compiled and printed by Lu Xun during his lifetime, such as "Woodcut Journey," "Collection to Attract Jade," and "Hundred Images of Dead Souls," within the next three years.
    Recently, printmaker Ye Fu has selected seventy-eight works created by Chinese artists over the past twenty years, including portraits of Lu Xun in various art forms, depictions of Lu Xun's life events, scenery of Lu Xun's hometown and former residence, and illustrations from Lu Xun's novels, and compiled them into "Selected Artworks Commemorating Lu Xun." This album, along with "Lu Xun on Art" compiled by Zhang Wang and "Lu Xun on Comic Strips" compiled by Jiang Weipu, will be published on the occasion of the twentieth anniversary of Lu Xun's death. An "Illustrated Biography of Lu Xun," using pictures to introduce the fighting life of Lu Xun, the great master of the Chinese cultural revolution, is also being edited. (Lin)

    珂勒惠支版画选集重印出版
    “鲁迅画传”正在编辑
    本报讯　鲁迅遗编的“凯绥·珂勒惠支版画选集”，最近将由人民美术出版社重印出版。这本画册是鲁迅在1936年自费编印的，原编为六开本，珂罗版，用宣纸精印，印数很少，久已绝版。这次重印，改为影写版，用道林纸印行。人民美术出版社在今后三年内，将有计划地把鲁迅生前编印的“木刻纪程”、“引玉集”、“死魂灵百图”等画册，全部重印出版。
    版画家野夫最近选辑了二十年来中国美术家们创作的各种画种的鲁迅像、鲁迅生平事迹、鲁迅故乡和故居的风景和鲁迅小说的插画等共七十八幅作品，编成“纪念鲁迅美术选集”。这本画册和张望编的“鲁迅论美术”、姜维朴编的“鲁迅论连环画”都将在纪念鲁迅逝世二十周年的日子里出版。用图片来介绍中国文化革命导师鲁迅的战斗的一生的“鲁迅画传”，也正在编辑中。（林）
