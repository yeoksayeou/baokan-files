    For the People's Lives
    Wang Taidong
    From Xiachen to Qiqi in Fenghua County, Zhejiang Province, there is a six- or seven-mile-long pebble road. Standing on this road and looking down at the Lion's Mouth of Xiangshan Port, the sea is as calm as a mirror, with sails dotting the surface. But who knows that on the night of August 1, a typhoon of force twelve struck Xiangshan Port, and the Lion's Mouth roared like thousands of lions. The wind and waves swept over the seawall, attacking the coastal villages of Qiqi, Piaoxi, and Zhanghu. Houses of hundreds of families were destroyed, and people who were sleeping were suddenly surrounded by rapidly rising floodwaters!

    Shi Genshui, a member of the Communist Youth League in the Piaoxi Agricultural Production Cooperative, had been lying at home for three days because his left eye was injured by rice straw while rushing to harvest early rice. That night, he heard the unusual sound of the wind outside and was discussing it with his father and wife when he suddenly heard a faint shout from outside: "Typhoon… families whose houses are not safe, quickly go to other houses to take shelter…." "Isn't this the voice of the cooperative director?" Genshui thought, "In the past, shouldn't this work have been done by me? It's all because of this eye, affecting so much work!"

    Shi Genshui's home was in a temple, with the seawall just outside the door and the Lion's Mouth beyond the wall. Around midnight, the wind grew stronger, and the tiles on the roof were blown off. Dai Yuanshun and Shi Ziting, who lived in the same courtyard, could no longer stay in their houses, so they brought their families (a total of eight people) to Shi Genshui's house for shelter. But soon after they arrived, they heard shouts from outside: "Get up quickly, the tide is already level with the seawall!" This was the voice of fisherman Hong Xin. Shi Genshui's father hurriedly went to open the door for him, but as soon as the door opened, water rushed in. Before long, the water rose to more than a foot, and even the jars inside the room were floating. The children were crying incessantly. Helpless, Shi Genshui helped everyone, young and old, to a relatively high hall nearby for temporary shelter.

    The sky was still pitch black. The howling wind carried fine rain, and the tide roared like tigers and wolves. Soon, the water in the hall rose above their knees. The temple door was destroyed, and the wall and the two stone lions outside the door were also washed down. Small sampans, tables, boxes, rice buckets, broken boat boards… floating on the water, also rushed into the hall with the wind and waves, hitting the people standing in the water. Suddenly, desperate cries for help came continuously from the temple door: "Help, help!"

    "Who is it?"
    "Isn't that Shi Ziyou's wife, A Ju, calling?"

    Shi Ziyou had gone to another village to cut rice a few days ago. He only had his wife in her forties and two daughters at home, the older one named Landi, only fourteen years old, and the younger one named Lanying, only nine years old. How could they not try to save them? But at this moment, Genshui's father remembered that there were still several baskets of grain, boxes, and chickens in his own house that he hadn't brought out, and he wanted Genshui to fetch them. Genshui said to him, "Saving people is more important, or saving things is more important!" After saying that, he took a flashlight and jumped into the chest-deep water. Hong Xin also followed him, swimming against the wind and waves towards the temple door, but he couldn't withstand the onslaught of the waves and soon returned to the temple. Shi Genshui continued to persevere alone. The debris swept in by the wind and waves bumped against his feet, but he couldn't care about the pain. When he reached Shi Ziyou's door, he immediately shouted, "Lanying, don't cry, your great-grandfather is here!"

    (In terms of seniority, Lanying should call Shi Genshui great-grandfather.) As he spoke, he shined the flashlight into the house. The house was nothing like a house, it was worse than a pavilion! The sea and the house were connected, and the water inside was already as deep as their bellies. The mother and three daughters stood on the bed and cried. Shi Genshui felt for the edge of the bed, picked up Lanying with his left hand, hung Landi on his right arm, and told A Ju to cling to his left shoulder and swam back. As soon as they left the house, the stove and table inside floated up and overturned in the water. Soon, the house was washed away by the tide.

    The tide in the hall continued to rise, almost reaching their thighs. The women and children were still crying non-stop. Hong Xin said to Genshui's father, "Great-grandfather, if we wait any longer, we'll lose our lives!" "Climb to the attic over there! I'll find a ladder!" Genshui's father said as he took the flashlight and jumped into the deep water. Suddenly, he fell. People were very nervous. Genshui's wife grabbed Genshui and said, "You're still holding other people's children, your father is drowning!" Suddenly, the old man floated to the surface again, and people felt relieved. The ladder was finally found and set up, and everyone climbed onto the attic one by one.

    At this time, Shi Genshui felt unbearable pain in his feet. He shined the flashlight on them, and both feet were bleeding profusely. Before long, a large pool of blood had formed.

    The water was still rising rapidly. In a moment, the water level was only two or three feet away from the attic. Hong Xin cried and said, "Once the water covers the floorboards, the house will collapse, and we'll still lose our lives!" Just as everyone was at a loss, Genshui's father suddenly pointed to the window on the wall and said, "Outside the window is a high ground. As long as we knock it down, we can climb along the high ground to the village above!" Shi Ziting looked and immediately picked up a stool floating on the water to smash the window. In just two or three blows, the window frames were broken. Shi Genshui climbed out of the window, stood in the chest-deep water, and successively took over three or four children and Dai Yuanshun's mother, and the others jumped out one by one. By this time, more than a dozen people had been rescued, but Shi Genshui's feet were severely injured. To commend Shi Genshui's exemplary deeds, the Ningbo Prefectural Committee of the Communist Youth League decided to award him the honorary title of "Outstanding League Member."

    为了人们的生命
    王泰栋
    从浙江省奉化县的下陈到鲒埼，有一段六、七里长的石子路。站在这条路上向下望象山港的狮子口，海水平静如镜，帆影点点。可是有谁知道，就在8月1日的深夜，十二级的台风冲击着象山港，狮子口像千万个狮子一样发出咆哮。风浪卷过了堤塘，奔袭着鲒埼、飘溪、章湖一带沿海的村子。几百户人家的房子被冲毁了，正在睡梦中的人们也被突然猛涨的洪水包围了！
    飘溪农业生产合作社有一个青年团员叫施根水，他因为在抢收早稻时被稻草刺坏了左眼，已经在家里躺了三天了。这天晚上，他听到了外面不平常的风声，正在和爸爸、爱人谈论着这件事，忽然从外面传来了隐约的喊叫声：“台风……，房子靠不住的人家，快到别家去躲一躲……。”“这不是社主任的声音吗？”根水想：“要是在往日，这个工作不是应该由自己来做吗？就是因为这只眼睛，影响了多少工作呀！”
    施根水的家是在一个庙里，门外就是海塘，塘外便是狮子口。快到十二点，风越来越大，房子上的瓦片都被揭了下来。住在同院的戴元顺和施自听，在屋里实在呆不下去了，他们就带着自己的家属（共八口）到施根水家来躲避。但刚来不久，就听到外面的喊叫声：“你们还不起身，潮水已经和塘一样平了！”这是渔民洪新的声音。施根水的爹急忙去给他开门，但门刚一开，紧跟着水就冲了进来。没多时，水都升到一尺多高，室内的缸也漂浮了起来，孩子们都一个劲地哭。没有办法，施根水就帮助大家扶老携幼，到附近一个地势比较高的大殿里暂时存身。
    天空仍然漆黑一片。狂风夹着细雨，潮水如虎狼一样地咆哮着。很快，大殿上的水就涨到了膝盖以上。庙门被冲毁了，墙和门外的两个石狮子也被冲倒了。浮在水面上的小舢板、桌子、箱子、稻桶、破船板……，也随着风浪冲进了大殿，向站在水中的人们猛撞。突然，庙门那边连续发出了声嘶力竭地叫喊：“救命哪，救命！”
    “是谁？”
    “这不是施自友的妻子阿菊在喊叫吗？”
    施自友前几天到外乡割稻去了。他家中只有一个四十多岁的妻子，还有两个女孩子，大的叫兰娣，才十四岁，小的叫兰英，才九岁。怎么能不想办法去救她们呢？但就在这个时候，根水的父亲记起自己的房子内还有好几箩谷子、箱子和鸡没有带出来，想叫根水去取。根水对他说：“救人要紧，还是救东西要紧！”说完，就拿了一支手电筒，跳进了深及胸部的水中。洪新也跟着他迎着风浪向庙门口泅去，但由于他受不了浪水的袭击，不久就又回到了庙里。施根水一人仍然坚持着。被风浪卷来的杂物在他的脚上乱撞，但也顾不得疼痛。当他摸到了施自友的门口时，立刻喊道：“兰英，别哭，太公来了！”
    （论辈，兰英应该叫施根水太公）他边说边用电筒向屋里照，这房子那里还像房子呀，简直比凉亭还不如！海水和房子连在一起，里边的水已有腹部那么深了。娘儿三个站在床上直哭。施根水摸到床边，左手抱起了兰英，右臂挂了兰娣，叫阿菊攀住他的左肩膀，泅了回来。刚一出门，房内的厨和桌子都浮了起来翻倒在水里，不久，房子就被潮水冲垮了。
    大殿上的潮水继续上涨着，快到大腿深了。妇女和孩子也在不停地哭着。洪新对根水的爹说：“太公，再等下去就要没命了！”“爬到那边阁楼上去！我去找梯子！”根水的爹边说边拿了电筒，就跳入深水中。突然，他倒下去了，人们心情十分紧张。根水的妻子一把拉住根水叫道：“还拉着人家的孩子，爹要淹死了！”忽地，老爹又浮出了水面，人们的心情才轻松下来。梯子终于找到了，也架好了，大家都一个个地爬上了阁楼。
    这时，施根水才感到双足疼痛难忍。用手电筒一照，双足都冒着鲜血。不一会，就流了一大摊。
    水，还在猛涨着。一会儿，水面离阁楼只有二、三尺了。洪新哭着说道：“水一没上楼板，房子就会倒塌，我们还是没命呀！”大家正苦无主意，根水的爹忽然指着墙上的窗子说：“窗外面是一块高地，只要把它敲掉，我们就可以顺着高地爬到上面的村子里！”施自听一看，连忙拿起水上浮着的凳子，去砸窗子。只两三下，窗棂就被砸断。施根水爬出窗口，站在深及胸部的水中，连续接过了三、四个小孩和戴元顺的娘，别的都一个个跳了出去。至此，十几个人都全部脱险了，但施根水的双足却受了重伤。为了表彰施根水的模范事迹，青年团宁波地委会决定授予他“优秀团员”的光荣称号。
