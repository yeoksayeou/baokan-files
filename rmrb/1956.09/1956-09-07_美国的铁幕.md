    The Iron Curtain of the United States
    Song Du
    At a press conference on August 31st, U.S. President Eisenhower said, "There is no one in the world who desires more than I do to send American news reporters... to China." He also said that China "is using the detention of American prisoners to try to make the United States take some action, which is obviously interpreted as meaning that we have accepted this situation and will no longer protest it. As long as these people are still being held as a means of developing relations between our country and the Chinese people, we simply cannot agree to such a thing." Eisenhower's words were very obscure, and there was obviously a difficulty in not being able to speak clearly.

    Since the news of our country's approval of American journalists to come to our country was spread by foreign news agencies, the U.S. government has taken various measures to sabotage and prevent them from coming. Even the routine procedures for our country's approval of American journalists to come to China for interviews have been portrayed as if we were begging the United States for some kind of favor. The U.S. State Department first described the approval of American journalists to enter the country as an "invitation," and said that some of those "invited" had never even thought of going to China. Later, it said that if we wanted American journalists to go to China, then we would have to release American prisoners first. It is not difficult to understand that this is because the U.S. government is publicizing hostility and obliterating our country to such an extent that many American journalists are willing to come to our country to understand the true situation, which makes the U.S. government extremely embarrassed and feels it necessary to distort things a bit, so as not to lose face too much. In fact, the U.S. government should know, and must know, that the American people are not satisfied with only seeing and hearing the so-called news about China produced by the State Department's "Voice of America" and certain offices every day; because they are often self-contradictory and full of loopholes. They cannot explain our country's achievements in international and domestic affairs, and they especially cannot understand why the United States is in an increasingly isolated trend on the China issue.

    Therefore, as far as we know, it is no accident that more than one hundred American journalists representing well-known American newspapers, broadcasting companies, and news agencies have applied to come to our country for interviews in the past few years.

    This time, our country has approved thirty-one representative journalists from major American newspapers to come for interviews, which shows our confidence. We hope to understand others, and we also hope that others will understand us. We hope that through the reports of foreign journalists, the broad masses of people around the world will know how we live and work. We have achieved successes, and we also have our shortcomings and difficulties. We never approve foreign journalists to come in order for them to write poems praising us.

    How foreign news reporters write reports is determined by the journalists' own professional level and professional ethics; and it should also be said that how their reports are published depends on the professional ethics of the newspaper editors. We are no strangers to some foreign professional anti-communist propagandists; we are also familiar with a certain type of person in Hong Kong who specializes in "talking" to those who are about to come or have already visited our country, in order to "influence" them to say things that are hostile to China. But we don't care. In the past two or three years, more than a hundred Western journalists have come to our country for interviews, and our government has never conducted news censorship. From our point of view, no matter how these journalists distort their reports, we believe that it will not harm us. Objective facts will eventually lead objective and conscientious news practitioners to draw conclusions that conform to reality. Most Western journalists who have interviewed in our country have come to just such conclusions.

    But this conclusion is what the U.S. State Department fears most; because its current policy toward our country is a policy of burying its head in the sand like an ostrich. This policy can only be maintained by taking advantage of the American people's ignorance of the actual situation in New China. And how long this policy can be maintained is precisely the inner fear of the U.S. ruling group. Therefore, the U.S. government is pursuing all possible means to block news, fearing that the hatred of China it has created through its policy of fooling the people will be destroyed. Especially in the run-up to the U.S. presidential election this year, in order to win votes, it dares not expose this deception even more. That is why the U.S. government has come out three times in a row within just two weeks to declare that it is prohibiting journalists from coming to China. After causing fierce opposition and protests from broad public opinion in the United States and internationally, it finally brought out President Eisenhower to suppress it; and Eisenhower had to make the reasons that cannot be seen by others appear legitimate, so he could only speak obscurely and vaguely.

    As for linking the arrival of American journalists in China with the American prisoners in China, and saying that the American prisoners were detained by us as a means of developing relations between the United States and the Chinese people, many American journalists have already publicly stated that these two things are completely incomparable. Not only that, such talk is simply absurd. Foreigners who violate the law in their host country and are imprisoned to serve their sentences are entirely within the scope of each country's exercise of sovereignty, and originally there would be no problem. True, imperialism once had so-called "extraterritoriality" in our country, and our territory was once ceded because a foreign missionary was killed; but that era is gone forever.

    Our country's policy toward American prisoners is to impose sentences separately based on the different circumstances of each case, and to grant lenient treatment to those who perform well during their sentences. One case and one method of handling is in line with the judicial principles of all modern countries.

    Today, it is the U.S. government itself that is using its own people as tools and "hostages" for political struggles. The U.S. government openly allocates funds in its budget for espionage activities in people's democratic countries. When its spies are discovered and imprisoned, it then shouts and screams about the imprisonment of these spies to incite hatred, and even goes so far as to distort the agreement it signed at the Geneva Conference to create misunderstandings between the people of China and the United States. Now it is even more simply bringing them out as an excuse to restrict American journalists from coming to our country. The Kyodo News Agency's New York report on August 14th on why the U.S. government does not want Americans to visit our country can be used as a footnote to these actions by the U.S. government. This report said that the U.S. domestic "pro-Chiang faction" is entrenched in the right wing of the Republican Party and is also monitoring the government internally; U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robertson once stated that he hoped that it would not be possible to establish any relationship with our country for a hundred years. The Kyodo News Agency reporter believes that the U.S. government means that contact and mutual understanding with our country is a burden, and quoted the famous saying of the nineteenth-century British writer Charles Lamb to illustrate: "I hate him so much that I don't want to see him, if I see him, maybe I can't hate him anymore." These words are not without reason.

    We express our regret that American journalists cannot come now, we hope that they will be able to come in the future, and we firmly believe that the U.S. State Department's Iron Curtain will ultimately not be able to stop the normal exchanges between the people of China and the United States, and the power of hatred will eventually not be able to defeat the power of friendship.

    美国的铁幕
    宋度
    美国总统艾森豪威尔8月31日在记者招待会上说：“全世界再没有比我更加希望派遣美国新闻记者……到中国去的了。”他又说，中国“利用扣留美国犯人的办法来设法使美国采取某种行动，这种行动显然是被解释成意味着我们已经接受了这一情况，而且也不会再抗议这种情况。只要这些人仍然被当作要发展我国同中国人的关系而扣留着，我们根本无法同意这种事情。”艾森豪威尔讲的话是十分隐晦的，这其中显然有他不能把话说清楚的苦衷。
    自从我国批准美国记者来我国的新闻被外国通讯社传播后，美国政府就采取了各种办法来破坏，阻止他们前来。连我国批准美国记者来华采访的常规手续都被渲染成我们乞求美国恩赐什么似的。美国国务院首先把批准美国记者入境说成是“邀请”，而且说“被邀请”的人有些从未想过要去中国。后来又说，如果我们要美国记者去中国，那么就得先释放美国犯人。不难了解，这是因为在美国政府那样宣传敌视和抹煞我国的时候，有不少美国记者愿意来我国了解真实情况，令美国政府极为难堪，而感到有必要歪曲一下，不致太过于丢脸。其实美国政府应当知道，也一定知道，美国人民是不满意每天只看到和听到国务院“美国之音”和某些办公室制造出来的所谓中国新闻的；因为它们经常是不能自圆其说，矛盾百出。他们不能解释我国在国际和国内的成就，他们尤其不能理解美国在中国问题上为什么处于日益孤立的趋势。
    因此，据我们所知，过去几年以来，已经有一百多起美国记者代表着美国著名的报刊、广播公司、通讯社申请来我国采访，这并不是偶然的。
    这一次我国批准了三十一个具有代表性的美国各大报刊的记者来采访，表现了我们的自信。我们希望了解旁人，也希望旁人了解我们。我们希望通过外国记者的报道，使全世界广大人民知道我们是怎样生活和工作的。我们取得了成就，我们也有我们的缺点和困难。我们批准外国记者来，从来不是为了他们会写赞美我们的诗篇。
    外国新闻记者怎么写报道是由记者自己的业务水平和职业道德决定；而且还应该说，他们的报道怎样被刊登，又有待报刊编辑的职业道德来决定。我们对外国有些职业反共宣传家并非陌生；我们也熟悉在香港有某一种人，专门找那些将要来或已经来过我国访问的人“谈话”，以便“影响”他们说敌视中国的话。但是我们并不在乎。近二、三年来，西方记者来我国采访的人数逾百，我们政府从未进行过新闻检查。从我们的观点来看，不管这些记者怎样歪曲报道，我们相信都是无损于我们的。客观的事实终将使客观的、有良心的新闻从业员得出符合于实际的结论。多数在我国采访过的西方记者得出的正是这样的结论。
    但是这个结论却是美国国务院最害怕的；因为它今天对我国的政策，就是一种埋首沙中的鸵鸟政策。这个政策只有利用美国人民对新中国的实际情况的无知才能维持下去。而这个政策究竟能够维持多久，正是美国统治集团的内心恐惧。因此，美国政府追求的是用尽一切的办法来封锁新闻，惟恐它靠愚民政策制造出来的对中国的仇恨被破坏。尤其是在今年美国总统大选前夕，为了骗取选票，更不敢戳穿这个骗局了。这就是为什么美国政府在短短两个星期之内出来三番五次地声明禁止记者来华的道理。在引起了美国国内和国际上的广大舆论剧烈反对和抗议之后，又终于搬出艾森豪威尔总统来压制；而艾森豪威尔要把不能见人的理由说成光明正大，就只能把话说得隐隐涩涩，十分玄虚了。
    至于把美国记者来华和在华的美犯联在一起，而又说美犯被我们扣留当作要发展美国同中国人的关系，不少美国记者已经公开表示这两桩事是完全不能相提并论的。不仅如此，这样的谈话简直是荒谬绝伦。外国人在所在国犯了法，被监禁服刑，完全是各国行使主权范围内的事，原本不会发生问题。不错，帝国主义在我国曾经有过所谓“治外法权”，在我国曾经因为有个外国传教士被杀而招致我们领土的被割据；但是这个时代已经一去不复返了。
    我国对美犯的政策，是根据各犯所犯不同的案情分别判刑，在服刑期间按其表现良好宽大处理，一个案子一个处理办法，这是合乎一切现代国家的司法的原则的。
    今天把自己的人民当做政治斗争的工具和“人质”正是美国政府自己。美国政府公开在预算中拨款作为在人民民主国家内进行特务工作用。当它的特务被人发现了，监禁了，却又利用这些特务被监禁的事大叫大嚷来煽动仇恨，甚至不惜歪曲宣传它自己在日内瓦会议上签了字的协议，以此来制造中美两国人民的误解。现在更干脆把他们搬出来当作限制美国记者来我国的借口。日本共同社纽约8月14日关于为什么美国政府不希望美国人访问我国的报道，很可以作为美国政府这些行动的注脚。这篇报道说：美国国内“亲蒋派”既盘踞在共和党的右派里，也盘踞在政府内部进行监视；美国助理国务卿罗伯逊就曾经表示过，盼望一百年也不可能实现和我国建立任何关系。共同社记者认为，美国政府的意思是和我国接触、相互理解是一种累赘，并引用了十九世纪英国文学家查鲁斯兰姆的名言来说明：“我因为恨他，所以不想见他，如果见了他，也许就不能再恨他了。”这些话不是没有道理的。
    我们对美国记者现在不能来表示遗憾，我们希望他们将来还是能够来，我们深信美国国务院的铁幕究竟阻挡不了中美两国人民之间的正常来往的，仇恨的力量终于敌不过友谊的力量。
