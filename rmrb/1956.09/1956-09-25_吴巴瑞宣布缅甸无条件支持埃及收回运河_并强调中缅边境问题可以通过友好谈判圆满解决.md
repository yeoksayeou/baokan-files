Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, September 24th: Burmese Prime Minister U Ba Swe said on September 23rd that Egypt's action to nationalize the Suez Canal was legitimate, and therefore the Burmese Federal Government gives it unconditional support.

    Speaking at the second-day meeting of the All-Burma Farmers Association annual conference, U Ba Swe said that Egypt is a free and sovereign country, and it has every right to nationalize the Suez Canal within its legal territory. Egypt has the right to enjoy all the benefits of this canal.

    This is the first statement by the Burmese government on the Suez Canal issue. In this statement, U Ba Swe also believed that Egypt should strictly abide by the principle of free navigation guaranteed by the former Suez Canal Company.

    U Ba Swe said that he believes it would be a good idea to discuss this issue with the Colombo countries. He also believes that these countries can promote a peaceful resolution to the problem.

    U Ba Swe also emphasized that Burma does not want to see any party harmed from the resolution of the canal issue, nor does it want to see this dispute erupt into war.

    When talking about the border issue between Burma and China, U Ba Swe reiterated Burma's policy of maintaining solid friendship with China, and pointed out that the border issue can be resolved satisfactorily through friendly and peaceful negotiations between the Burmese and Chinese governments.

    When talking about domestic issues, U Ba Swe pointed out that the Burmese government is determined to go all out to destroy anti-government forces within two years. He emphasized that the period of achieving peace through negotiations with underground forces is over.

    The following resolutions were passed at the All-Burma Farmers Association meeting that day: to support the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence between countries around the world, to demand the improvement of the economy and education of Burmese farmers, and to strengthen the protection of farmers.

    The meeting also elected U Ba Swe as the Chairman of the All-Burma Farmers Association, Bo Khin Maung Gale as the Vice Chairman, and Tekin Kyaw Dun as the Secretary.

    吴巴瑞宣布缅甸无条件支持埃及收回运河
    并强调中缅边境问题可以通过友好谈判圆满解决
    新华社仰光24日电　缅甸总理吴巴瑞9月23日说，埃及把苏伊士运河收归国有的行动是合法的，因此缅甸联邦政府给以无条件的支持。
    吴巴瑞在全缅农民协会年会第二天会议上讲话时说，埃及是一个自由和有主权的国家，它有充分权利把在它合法领土内的苏伊士运河收归国有。埃及拥有享用这条运河的收益全部利益的权利。
    这是缅甸政府第一次就苏伊士运河问题发表声明。吴巴瑞在这个声明中还认为，埃及应当严格遵守前苏伊士运河公司所保证的自由通航的原则。
    吴巴瑞说，他认为，如果就这个问题同科伦坡国家商量，那将是一个好主意。他还认为这些国家能够促使问题得到和平解决。
    吴巴瑞还强调说，缅甸不希望看到任何一方从运河问题解决中受到损害，它也不希望看到这个争执爆发成为战争。
    吴巴瑞在谈到缅甸和中国之间的边境问题的时候，重新申述了缅甸的同中国保持巩固的友谊的政策，并且指出，边境问题是可以通过缅中两国政府之间的友好和平谈判得到圆满解决的。
    在谈到国内问题的时候，吴巴瑞指出，缅甸政府坚决要在两年内全力以赴地摧毁反政府力量。他着重指出，通过同地下力量之间的谈判来实现和平的时期已经过去了。
    全缅农民协会的这一天会议通过了下列决议：拥护世界各国之间和平共处的五项原则，要求提高缅甸农民的经济和教育，加强对农民的保障。
    会议还选出了吴巴瑞为全缅农民协会主席，波庆貌格礼为副主席，德钦觉顿为秘书。
    全缅农民协会的年会在9月23日下午宣告结束。
