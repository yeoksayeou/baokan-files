Give Sweet Potatoes a Boost in Late Growth
Sun ShuHan

Judging from the situation in many regions, although sweet potatoes are generally growing well this year, some areas with excessive rainfall have experienced excessive vine growth and slow tuber development due to the failure to cultivate and turn the vines in time. Some summer sweet potatoes planted later are also not growing well due to poor land preparation and insufficient base fertilizer.

Sweet potatoes differ from ordinary crops in that they have the habit of continuous growth and can still absorb nutrients until harvest time. Based on this characteristic of sweet potatoes, strengthening field management and providing sufficient nutrients in the period before harvest can greatly increase yields. According to the experience of Shandong Province, a late-stage top dressing of fertilizer on sweet potato fields can generally increase production by about 10%. The fertilizer applied in this way must be quick-acting, such as ammonium sulfate, diluted human urine, and plant ash. However, only phosphorus and potassium fertilizers should be applied to sweet potatoes with excessive vine growth.

Under normal circumstances, once sweet potatoes enter the normal tuber development stage, it is not advisable to turn the vines again, so as not to affect the normal growth of stems and leaves and photosynthesis. However, for sweet potato fields that are wet due to excessive rain this year, it is still possible to lift the vines, cultivate, and sun the ridges. This can promote the evaporation of soil moisture in the sweet potato fields, raise the soil temperature, and is conducive to the later growth and development of sweet potatoes. It also has the effect of inhibiting the growth of above-ground parts and forcing them to switch to tuber development for sweet potatoes with excessive growth.

Generally speaking, there are still two months left before the sweet potato harvest in most areas. Farmers in sweet potato-producing areas should not let go of this opportunity to increase production and ensure a good harvest.

    给甘薯的后期生长加一把劲
    孙叔涵
    根据许多地区情况看，今年各地的甘薯虽然大部生长良好，但是有些雨水过多地区，因为没有及时中耕翻蔓，而有薯蔓徒长、结薯缓慢现象。部分扦插较晚的夏薯，由于整地质量差，基肥不足，生长得也不很好。
    甘薯和一般作物不同，它具有延续生长的习性，直到收获时期仍能吸收养分。根据甘薯的这一特点，如果在收获以前一个阶段中，加强田间管理，给以充足养分，对提高产量是有很大作用的。据山东省经验，对甘薯田进行一次后期追肥，一般可以增产10％左右。这样施用的肥料，必需是速效的，如硫铵、稀释的人尿、草木灰等。但对徒长的甘薯只能施用磷、钾肥料。
    根据一般情况，甘薯进入正常结薯阶段，就不宜再行翻蔓，以免影响茎叶正常生长和光合作用。但是，对于今年雨多地湿的甘薯地，还可以进行一次提蔓和中耕晒垅。这样可以促进薯地土壤水份蒸发，提高地温，有利于甘薯后期的生长发育。对徒长的甘薯还有抑制地上部分生长，迫使转入结薯的作用。
    就大部地区说，目前距甘薯收获期还有两个月的光景，甘薯产区的农民，不要放松这个增产保收的机会。
