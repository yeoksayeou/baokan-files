Can a Bride "Randomly" Speak and Meddle in "Other People's" Affairs?
    Yan Jianbi
     The "Strategies of the Warring States," "Strategies of Wei," contains the following story:

    A man from the State of Wei was marrying a new wife. As soon as the bride got into the bridal carriage, she asked the driver, "Hey! Whose horses are those harnessed to the sides of the shaft?" The driver replied, "They are borrowed." The bride then said to the driver's family member, "Take good care of those horses harnessed to the sides of the shaft, and don't whip our shaft horses! Understand?" As soon as the carriage arrived at the entrance of her husband's house, people helped her down; as soon as her feet touched the ground, she told the accompanying maid, "Remember! You must go and put out the fire in the stove in a little while; don't let it catch fire! Ah?! Be very careful, remember!" As she entered the courtyard, she saw a rice mortar placed in the middle of the path, and she turned her head to instruct the maid again, "Move it to the base of the window, it's obstructing people walking by here!" The husband's family members secretly laughed at her after seeing and hearing her words and actions. -- Why did they laugh at her? They laughed at her for not being like a common, typical bride. They felt that: how could she be so talkative and meddlesome right after arriving? The person who recorded this story commented:

    These three statements of hers were all perfectly proper and good words; however, she was inevitably ridiculed in secret because the timing of her speech was inappropriate, a bit too early, because she was a new bride who had just arrived!

    In the old society, "prudent in speech and cautious in action" was a "motto" for conducting oneself; "don't sweep the snow from another's roof" was an "essential trick" for avoiding trouble and protecting oneself wisely. Especially when a person of low status and humble position goes to a new organization without any "backing," he should "bow more," "speak less," and "interfere less"; he must be like a shy, reticent, and reserved bride, so as not to arouse suspicion or invite ridicule. If one is "unaware of the times," "unclear about the greater good," and insists on "sticking one's neck out," "speaking randomly," and "meddling in other people's affairs," then regardless of whether what you "say" and "manage" is right or wrong, you will be lightly laughed at and heavily attacked; because "a gentleman thinks only about what is within his position," and someone who has just arrived, how dare they open their mouths?!

    The new society is different; it encourages people to "act bravely for a just cause" and "speak out righteously," "always and in everything to adopt the attitude of being the master." However, this is a general "principle"; and in some "specific" places, it sometimes doesn't quite work. If someone really "always and in everything adopts the attitude of being the master" to say what should be said and manage what should be managed, it is often not commended by certain leaders, nor is it welcomed by certain senior members of the organization; because to those mothers-in-law, aunts, grannies, sisters-in-law, and sisters-in-law, who do you, the new bride, "think you are"? How dare you point fingers and comment on everything as soon as you enter the door, what kind of system is that? (The "People's Daily" published such a news item the year before last: a truly active and master-conscious worker who had just arrived at a certain factory, because he was conscientious and responsible, loved to talk and loved to manage affairs, was envied and said to love "speaking randomly" and love "meddling in other people's affairs" and was "rectified"!)

    Recently, the Party Central Committee put forward the slogan of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" with the democratic parties. This is another wise and timely measure of the Party. In the past, we have heard and seen: some things, in the eyes of certain party members with sectarian sentiments, are only the responsibility of "me" and "us" people in the organization, and "me" and "us" are responsible for the good or bad; what are "you" and "you" non-Party members "randomly" sticking your mouths in, wanting to stretch out your hands, and meddling in "other people's" affairs? It seems that only "he" and "they" are the masters of the country, and others can only be guests; "he" and "they" are old members of the family, while others are new brides who have just arrived in this revolutionary big family, without the qualifications to speak or lend a hand.

    Can and should a new bride speak and manage affairs? I think: now is not the Warring States period, new brides can and should speak and manage affairs. Not to mention that what she says is all so-called "perfect words" ("Strategies of Wei" originally wrote "perfect words"), even if what she says is a bit "random" and what she manages is a bit "meddlesome," it seems to be much stronger than the past "don't sweep the snow from another's roof" of "standing idly by" and "letting things be."

    While new brides should strive to "speak" and "manage," certain mothers-in-law, aunts, grannies, sisters-in-law, and sisters-in-law should also stop showing off their seniority and ridiculing "her" "them" "who do you think you are?"!

    新娘子可不可以“乱”说话、管“闲”事？
    阎简弼
     “战国策”“卫策”中有下面一个故事：
    卫国的一个人娶新媳妇儿。这个新娘子上了花车就问赶车的：“喴！边辕上套的马是谁的呀？”赶车的回答说：“那是借来的。”新娘子就对这个赶车的家员说：“好好地看承人家那边辕的马，也别鞭打咱那驾辕的牲口！啊，听见了吗？”车子一到丈夫家的门口儿，人们将她搀扶了下来；脚刚着地，她就告诉陪送她来的伴姆说：“记着！您一会儿可去把那灶膛里的火熄灭掉；不看着了火！啊？！千万当心点儿，记着！”一进院子，瞧见当道儿摆着一个捣米臼，她又回头叮嘱伴姆说：“把它搬到窗根儿底下去，它在这儿妨碍来往走路的人！”婆家的人看了和听了她这些言动，都暗暗地笑话她。——为啥笑话她呐？笑她不像个一般所常见的新娘子。觉着她：怎么新来乍到，就这么爱说话、爱管闲事？！记载这段故事的人发表议论说：
    她这三次发言，说的都是正经八倍的大好话；可是，不免被暗地里讥笑，那是她说话的时间不合适，未免早了些，因为她是个新来乍到的新媳妇哇！
    在旧社会里，“谨言慎行”是持身的“格言”；“莫管他人瓦上霜”是少惹是非、明哲自保的处世“要诀”。尤其一个名低位卑的人到一个没有“靠山”的新机关里去，就更该“多作揖”、“少开口”、“少管事”；要像一个羞羞涩涩、缄口缩手的新娘子，那才不致招猜忌，惹讥议。要是“不识时务”、“不明大义”、硬要“强出头”、“乱说话”、“管闲事”，那就要不管你“说”的“管”的对不对，会弄得轻则被笑，重将见击；因为“君子思不出其位”，新来乍到的，那配张嘴？！
    新社会不同了，它鼓励人“见义勇为”、“仗义执言”，“时时事事都要拿出作主人的态度来”。然而，这是一般的“原则”；而在某些“具体”的地方，有时就并不怎么行的通。有人真要是“时时事事都拿出主人的态度来”对该说的说、该管的管时，常常是并不为某些领导人所嘉勉，也并不为本机关中的某些资格老的成员所欢迎；因为让那些婆婆、婶子、大娘、妯娌、大小姑子们看起来，你这个新媳妇子“算个老几”？竟敢一进门子就指东画西，评南论北，那还成个什么体统？（前年“人民日报”上就登载过一条这样的新闻：一个新到某工厂的真正积极有主人感的工人，因为认真负责，爱说话、爱管事，就被嫉、被说成爱“乱说话”、爱“管闲事”而被“整”了！）
    最近党中央提出了跟民主党派“长期共存、互相监督”的口号。这又是党的一个英明而及时的措施。过去我们听到和看到过：有些事情，在某些有宗派情绪的党团员看来，这只是“我”“我们”在组织里的人所该管的，好坏由“我”“我们”来负责；“你”“你们”非党团人士“乱”插什么嘴，想伸什么手，管什么“闲”事？好像国家只有“他”“他们”才是主人，别人都只能作客；“他”“他们”是家中的老成员，而别人则是这个革命大家庭的新来乍到的新媳妇，没有资格开口伸手。
    新媳妇可不可以、该不该说话、管事呐？我认为：现在不是战国时代了，新媳妇是可以而且应该说话、管事的。不要说她说的都是所谓“至言”（“卫策”原文作“至言”），就是她所说的“乱”些，所管的“闲”些，似乎比过去的“莫管他人瓦上霜”的“袖手旁观”、“好坏由他”强的多。
    新媳妇固然应当争取着“说”与“管”，而某些个婆婆、婶子、大娘、妯娌、大小姑子们可也别再搬那老资格，讥笑“她”“她们”“你算老几？”了！
