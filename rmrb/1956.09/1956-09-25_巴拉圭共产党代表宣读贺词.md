Comrades,

Please allow us, in the name of the Central Committee of the Paraguayan Communist Party, to extend fraternal greetings to the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China. Please also allow us to extend sincere respect to Comrade Mao Zedong, who leads the Marxist-Leninist Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. We also extend warm greetings to the heroic Chinese people who, under the leadership of the long-tested Communist Party of China, have victoriously completed the new democratic revolution, liberated themselves from the shackles of imperialism and feudalism, and are now, inspired by the example of the Soviet Union, building socialism.

The liberation of the Chinese people from the oppression of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, the economic recovery in just a few years, the complete realization of land reform, the establishment of a people's democratic system, and China's victorious advance towards a socialist society are major events of world historical significance.

The experience of the great Chinese revolution shows our people that they too can liberate themselves from the shackles of American imperialism, from the anti-national dictatorial rule of the Stroessner regime, the tool of landlords and big speculators; that Paraguay can become, and will certainly become, a free and sovereign independent country like the great People's Republic of China; and that as long as the people unite their powerful forces in a united front against imperialism and feudalism based on the worker-peasant alliance, and wage unremitting struggles under the leadership of the working class and its revolutionary party, the Paraguayan Communist Party, Paraguay can get rid of poverty and bankruptcy.

The Paraguayan people will never allow American monopoly capitalists to plunder them arbitrarily under the deceptive guise of "aid," and will never tolerate turning our country into a military base and strategic transportation hub for the United States to launch aggressive wars against the Soviet Union, People's China, and other peace-loving peoples. In fact, our people are increasingly resolutely fighting against American interference in our national life, striving to restore the independence of the motherland, striving to lift martial law, implement unconditional amnesty, and abolish the repressive Law No. 294, striving for the immediate release of political prisoners, striving for broad democratic freedoms, striving to improve the poor living conditions of the people, and striving for peace. The Paraguayan Communist Party calls for strengthening the united action of workers, striving to promote a broad national front of all democratic, popular, and patriotic forces, including the national bourgeoisie, to establish a new democratic coalition government, which will convene a free and autonomous national constitutional congress to formulate a democratic constitution for the country and safeguard national independence, and establish trade and diplomatic relations with all countries.

We are confident that the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China will bring a huge new impetus to the development of the national economy, and the result will be a continuous improvement in the material and cultural life of the great Chinese people.

The profound socialist transformations completed in China have further strengthened the powerful socialist world system, the existence of which has become the most important fact of our time. The peaceful, democratic, and socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and People's China is now growing stronger.

We fully believe that the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China will greatly promote the further consolidation of the Five Principles. These principles are peaceful coexistence, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutually beneficial cooperation among all countries, large and small, to transform the relaxation of the international situation into lasting peace. Colonialists and those obsessed with "positions of strength" will suffer new defeats. The victorious Marxist-Leninist theory creatively developed by the historical resolutions of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union will be further enriched by the summary of new experiences.

The people of the whole world, including our people, demand that the People's Republic of China with its 600 million people obtain its due legal status in the United Nations; demand that the Americans withdraw from Taiwan, and Taiwan must be returned to the People's Republic of China.

Comrades, we warmly hope that the Communist Party of China, which is convening this congress, will achieve new and great successes in its heroic struggle to build a socialist society, and in the struggle to win peace, national independence, and security for the people of all countries. We Paraguayan Communists will strive to apply the rich experience of your Eighth National Congress.

Long live the Communist Party of China!

Long live the powerful socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!

Long live the international solidarity of the working people!

Long live peace and friendship between the people of all countries!

Central Committee of the Paraguayan Communist Party

### 巴拉圭共产党代表宣读贺词

专栏：

    巴拉圭共产党代表宣读贺词同志们：
    请允许我们以巴拉圭共产党中央委员会的名义向中国共产党第八次代表大会致以兄弟般的敬意。也请允许我们向领导中国共产党马克思列宁主义的中央委员会的毛泽东同志致以真挚的敬意。我们也向在久经考验的中国共产党的领导下，胜利地完成了新型的民主革命，从帝国主义和封建主义的羁绊下解放了自己，今天在苏联榜样的鼓舞下，正在建设社会主义的英勇的中国人民致以热烈的敬礼。
    中国人民从帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本的压迫下所获得的解放、在短短的几年内的经济恢复、彻底的土地改革的实现、人民民主制度的建立和中国向社会主义社会胜利的迈进，是具有世界历史意义的重大事件。
    伟大的中国革命的经验向我国人民表明了他们也能够从美帝国主义的枷锁下，从地主、大投机商及其统治工具斯特罗埃斯纳反民族的独裁专政下解放出来；表明了巴拉圭也能够成为，而且一定将成为一个像伟大的中华人民共和国那样的自由的和主权独立的国家；也表明了只要人民把他强大的力量团结在以工农联盟为基础的反对帝国主义反对封建主义的统一战线里，在工人阶级及其革命政党巴拉圭共产党的领导下进行不懈的斗争，巴拉圭就可以摆脱贫困和破产的处境。
    巴拉圭人民决不让美国垄断资本家带着“援助”的骗人的假面具任意地掠夺自己，决不容忍把我国变成美国向苏联、人民中国以及其他爱好和平的人民发动侵略战争的军事基地和战略交通的枢纽。实际上，我国人民正在越来越坚决地进行着斗争，反对美国干涉我国国家生活，争取恢复祖国的独立，争取解除戒严状态，实施无例外的大赦和废除二百九十四号镇压法，争取立即释放政治犯，争取广泛的民主自由，争取改善人民穷苦的生活条件，争取和平。巴拉圭共产党号召加强工人的统一行动，努力促成由一切民主的、人民的和爱国的力量、包括民族资产阶级参加的广泛的民族阵线，以成立一个民主联合的新政府，由这新政府召开自由、自主的全国立宪代表大会，为国家制订出一部民主的宪法，并维护民族独立、同所有国家建立贸易关系和外交关系。
    我们确信中国共产党第八次代表大会将给国民经济的发展带来巨大的新的推动力，其结果就会使伟大的中国人民的物质文化生活日益改善。
    在中国完成的各项深刻的社会主义改造，更加加强了强大的社会主义世界体系，这个体系的存在，成为我们时代中的最重要的事实。以苏联和人民中国为首的和平民主社会主义阵营现在正在日益强盛。
    我们完全相信中国共产党第八次代表大会将大大地促使五项原则更为稳固。这些原则就是和平共处，互不侵犯，互不干涉内政，所有大小国家平等和互利合作，使国际形势的缓和转变为持久的和平。殖民主义者和热衷于“实力地位”的家伙们将遭到新的失败。为苏联共产党二十次代表大会历史性决议所创造性地发挥了的胜利的马克思列宁主义理论，将因新经验的总结而更加丰富。
    全世界人民，也包括我国人民，都要求拥有六亿人口的人民中国在联合国取得其应有的合法地位；要求美国人退出台湾，台湾必须归还给中华人民共和国。
    同志们：我们热烈地希望召开这次代表大会的中国共产党在它建设社会主义社会的英勇的斗争中，在为争取各国人民的和平、民族独立和安全的斗争中，获得新的巨大的成就。我们巴拉圭共产党员们将努力运用您们第八次代表大会的丰富经验。
    中国共产党万岁！
    以苏联为首的强大的社会主义阵营万岁！
    劳动者的国际团结万岁！
    各国人民之间的和平和友谊万岁！
              巴拉圭共产党中央委员会
                            一九五六年九月
