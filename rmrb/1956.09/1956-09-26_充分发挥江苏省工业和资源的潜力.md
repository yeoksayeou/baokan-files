    Comrade Liu Shunyuan, Secretary of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee, spoke:
    I fully agree with the reports made by Comrades Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, and Deng Xiaoping.
    I would now like to offer some opinions on the full utilization of Jiangsu's industry.
    At present, most of Jiangsu Province's industries, with the exception of a few such as silk and flour, have recovered to and surpassed their pre-War of Resistance Against Japan levels. The telecommunications industry, heavy chemical industry, and manufacturing of machinery and scientific instruments in the Nanjing area have also seen new developments.
    Jiangsu's industrial resources, especially light industrial resources such as cotton and silkworm cocoons, are relatively abundant, the technical foundation is relatively good, and cooperation between enterprises is also relatively convenient. However, our utilization of these favorable conditions is insufficient. Over the past three years, the state's investment in Jiangsu's local industry has totaled 38 million yuan, only 4.78 percent of the profits and taxes turned over by Jiangsu's local industry. The investment used to replace fixed equipment is not even enough to offset the depreciation of fixed assets during the same period. As a result, various industrial and transportation equipment cannot be updated in a timely manner, and the number of overdue equipment is increasing. The utilization rate of some industries' equipment capacity is low, with the worst, such as matches and cigarettes, being less than 25 percent. The utilization of resource potential is even worse. For example, the province has more than 1,000 li of coastline, but the output of marine products accounts for only 20 percent of the reserves, and only 20 percent of the area of rivers and lakes is utilized. This very insufficient utilization of existing industries and various resource potentials is detrimental to the country's economic construction. At the same time, it does not adequately address the difficulty of labor employment in Jiangsu, which has little land and a large population, and the people's desire to gradually improve their lives.
    During the Second Five-Year Plan period, we must actively tap the potential of industry in accordance with the state's requirements for coastal industries and the characteristics of Jiangsu's industry. The situation in Jiangsu's cotton textile industry, where there is more cotton than spinning capacity and more weaving than spinning capacity, should be gradually changed. Raw silk production has only recovered to 88 percent of the highest annual output before the War of Resistance Against Japan. With the recovery and development of sericulture, Jiangsu's raw silk industry should be actively renovated and expanded. The backwardness of fishery production should also be gradually changed. The machinery industry should carry out appropriate renovations and expansions according to the technical specialties of each factory and the needs of industrial and agricultural production in the province, to serve the technical transformation of the province's industry and the country's large-scale industry, and actively complete various repair and cooperation tasks. The chemical industry has a good foundation, and some products, such as argon and plexiglass, are still rare in the country, so they should continue to be renovated and expanded. Preliminary surveys of the coalfield area near Xuzhou show that it covers 1,450 square kilometers, with reserves of approximately 10 billion tons or more. It is recommended that the state expand new mine shafts on the original basis of the Jiawang Coal Mine and actively utilize them. Jiangsu's current power supply is very tight, and the expansion and construction projects of the Nanjing, Xuzhou, and Xin Hai Lian power plants urgently need to start as soon as possible. The basic construction plan for Jiangsu's power supply during the Second Five-Year Plan should also be determined as soon as possible to adapt to the development of industrial and agricultural power irrigation in the future.
    Hopes for Relevant Central Departments
    We fully support the Party Central Committee's policy of giving priority to the development of heavy industry and the development of new industrial bases. In the past, the state planning agencies and some central departments were concerned about Jiangsu's industry and gave instructions and assistance. However, some measures were not entirely reasonable in terms of plan balancing and handling inter-regional relations, and there were excessive and strict restrictions on investment in basic construction. We hope that this can be improved in the future. Some central departments take more from and give less to old factories and old areas, and take more technical personnel and add very few university and college students. This approach does not utilize the foundation by appropriately strengthening and actively developing it, but actually weakens it. In the future, in the work of training and allocating technical forces, while carrying out basic construction of new factories, most of the cadres and technical workers allocated to the new factories can first be placed in similar old factories for internships. When the new factories are completed, most of the cadres and workers needed can be uniformly allocated in the old factories. Adopting this approach is conducive to the rapid commissioning of new factories.
    Hopes for the Central Shanghai Bureau
    Jiangsu's industry is a component of China's East China industrial base, which is centered on Shanghai. Since liberation, in the relationship between friendly neighbors and between urban and rural areas, mutual support, division of labor, and cooperation have generally been achieved, but in some aspects, there is still insufficient overall consideration. We suggest that under the unified leadership of the Central Government and the unified balance of the state plan, the Central Shanghai Bureau should strengthen its leadership and comprehensively and properly coordinate the relationship between friendly neighbors within the East China industrial base, to rationally utilize the natural resources of various places, tap industrial potential, improve industrial layout, and balance the development of the national economy.
    The Provincial Party Committee's Future Work
    The Provincial Party Committee has shortcomings and errors in its leadership of industry. Jiangsu was established as a province relatively late, and the Provincial Party Committee was a step late in grasping the planning of industry. In our practical work, we considered maintaining and transforming the existing more, and we did not report the situation to the Central Government and put forward positive suggestions enough. In handling the relationship between industry and agriculture, we emphasized the aspect of saving raw materials and improving the output rate of agricultural product processing industries, and neglected the aspect of processing agricultural products locally and keeping by-products as feed for raising pigs and using pig manure to fertilize fields. Therefore, we transferred too many raw materials and concentrated them in urban processing, which not only affected the survival of local small processing workshops, but also affected the supply and marketing of feed and cake fertilizer and the needs of farmers' production and life.
    In the future, the Party organizations at all levels in Jiangsu must earnestly study and resolutely implement the spirit of the various reports of the Eighth National Congress of the Party, strengthen the leadership of agricultural production while earnestly strengthening the leadership of industrial production, adjust the existing industrial layout step by step, actively carry out technical transformation, appropriately restore and develop the processing industry of rural agricultural products, fully utilize the existing industrial base and the various resources of light and heavy industries, actively play the role of local industry, and strive to support the country's key construction, further develop industrial and agricultural production in Jiangsu Province, gradually improve the lives of the people of the province, and build our country into a great socialist industrialized nation.

### 充分发挥江苏省工业和资源的潜力

    充分发挥江苏省工业和资源的潜力
    中共江苏省委书记　刘顺元同志的发言
    我完全同意刘少奇同志、周恩来同志和邓小平同志所作的报告。
    我现在就充分利用江苏工业的问题，发表一些意见。
    目前，江苏省的工业，除蚕丝、面粉等几个产业外，一般的都已经恢复到并且超过了抗日战争以前的水平。南京地区的电讯工业、重化学工业和机器、科学仪器制造业，还有了新的发展。
    江苏的工业资源，尤其是棉花、蚕茧等轻工业资源比较丰富，技术基础比较好，企业间的协作也比较方便。但是，我们对这些有利条件的利用是不充分的。过去三年来，国家对江苏地方工业的投资共三千八百万元，仅为江苏地方工业上缴利润和税收的百分之四点七八，其中用于更换固定设备的投资还抵不上同一时期固定资产的折旧，以致各项工业交通运输的设备，得不到及时的更新，超龄的部分日益增加。有些产业的设备能力的利用率有的偏低，最差的如火柴、卷烟还不足百分之二十五。资源潜力的利用更差，如全省有一千多华里的海岸线，但海产的产量仅占蕴藏量的百分之二十，江河湖泊面积也只利用了百分之二十。这种对原有工业和各种资源潜力利用很不充分的情况，是不利于国家的经济建设的；同时，对于江苏地少人多，劳动就业困难和人民要求逐步改善生活的愿望，也是照顾不够的。
    在第二个五年计划期间，我们必须根据国家对沿海工业的要求和江苏工业的特点，积极地发掘工业的潜力。江苏棉纺织工业中棉多于纺、织大于纺的情况，应当逐步改变过来。缫丝生产现在仅恢复到抗日战争前最高年产量的百分之八十八，随着蚕桑事业的恢复和发展，江苏的缫丝工业应当积极进行改建和扩建。渔业生产的落后情况，也应当有步骤地加以改变。机械工业应当按照各厂的技术专长和本省工农业生产的需要，进行适当的改建和扩建，为本省工业的技术改造和国家的大工业服务，并积极完成各方面的修配协作任务。化学工业基础较好，有些产品如氩气、有机玻璃等，在国内还是不多的，应当继续加以改建和扩建。徐州地区附近煤田面积初步查明的就有一千四百五十平方公里，蕴藏量约在一百亿吨以上，建议国家在贾汪煤矿的原有基础上，扩建新矿井，积极加以利用。江苏目前的电力供应已很紧张，南京、徐州、新海连电厂的扩建新建工程，亟须尽速开工。第二个五年计划中，关于江苏供电的基本建设计划，也要及早确定，才能适应今后工业和农业电力灌溉事业的发展。
    对中央有关部门的希望
    我们完全拥护党中央的优先发展重工业和发展新的工业基地的方针。过去国家计划机关和中央有些部门，对江苏工业是关心的，是给予指示和帮助的，但是，在计划平衡和处理地区之间关系上，有些措施不尽合理，在基本建设投资方面，也限制得过多过严，希望今后能够有所改进。中央有的部门，对老厂、老地区要得多，给得少，对技术人员抽得多，大中学生补充很少，这种做法，不是在适当增强和积极发展的基础上来利用它，而是实际上削弱它。今后，在技术力量的培训调配工作上，在新厂进行基本建设的同时，可以先将配给新厂的大部分干部和技术工人，放到同类型的老厂中去实习，在新厂建成时，需要的干部和工人，就可以大部分在老厂中统一调配。采取这种做法，有利于新厂尽速投入生产。
    对中央上海局的希望
    江苏工业是以上海为中心的我国华东工业基地的一个组成部分。解放以后，在友邻间、城乡间的关系上，一般地是作到了相互支援、分工协作，但在某些方面仍然存在着统筹兼顾不够的地方。我们建议：在中央的统一领导和国家计划的统一平衡下，请中央上海局加强领导，全面而妥善地协调华东工业基地内部友邻间的关系，以便合理地利用各地自然资源，发挥工业潜力，改进工业布局，平衡国民经济的发展。
    省委今后的工作
    省委对工业领导上是有缺点和错误的。江苏建省比较迟，省委对工业的规划又抓迟了一步。我们在实际工作中，从维持改造方面考虑得多，向中央反映情况和提出积极建议也不够。在处理工农业关系上，我们对农产品加工工业，重视了节约原料，提高出品率的一面，忽视了把农产品在本地加工，并把副产品留作饲料养猪，用猪粪肥田的一面，因而过多地调出原料，集中到城市加工，不仅影响到当地小型加工作坊的生存，也影响到饲料、饼肥的供销和农民生产、生活的需要。
    今后，我们江苏党的各级组织一定要认真地学习和坚决地贯彻执行党的八次大会的各项报告的精神，在加强对农业生产的领导的同时，切实加强对工业生产的领导，有步骤地调整现有工业布局，积极进行技术改造，适当恢复与发展乡村的农产品的加工工业，充分利用现有工业基础和轻重工业的各项资源，积极发挥地方工业的作用，为支援国家重点建设，为江苏省的工农业生产的进一步发展，为全省人民生活的逐步改善，为把我国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义工业化的国家而奋斗。
