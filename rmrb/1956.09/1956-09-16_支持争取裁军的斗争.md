    Supporting the Struggle for Disarmament

    The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China has passed a resolution expressing its full support for the appeal of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union to the parliaments of all countries on the issue of disarmament. This is another demonstration of the Chinese people's consistent and strong will to advocate disarmament, the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons, and the strengthening of international peace. If the parliaments of all countries can take corresponding actions, the disarmament stalemate can be broken, and the arms race can be stopped.

    The appeal of the Fifth Session of the Fourth Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union on the issue of disarmament is of great significance for promoting a swift resolution to the disarmament issue. The easing of international tensions and the development of international trust have provided favorable conditions for countries to implement disarmament and prohibit the testing and use of atomic and hydrogen weapons. As long as the major powers, especially the United States, are sincere, the issue of reducing armaments and prohibiting atomic and hydrogen weapons, which the people of all countries desire, will not be difficult to resolve. The Soviet government has not only consistently advocated disarmament but has also set an example in action. The Soviet Union took the lead in reducing its armed forces by 640,000 in 1955 and later decided to reduce them by 1.2 million. This practical action by the Soviet Union has been praised and supported by public opinion in various countries. Other socialist countries, including the German Democratic Republic, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, which are under the threat of division and war preparations by the United States, have taken similar steps. China has also consistently and resolutely advocated that all countries in the world, especially the major powers, should reduce their armaments and prohibit atomic and hydrogen weapons, and in recent years, it has successively reduced its armed forces by more than 2.7 million. It will continue to work in this direction in the future. These facts powerfully demonstrate that the Soviet Union's proposal that countries should voluntarily reduce their armaments without waiting for an international disarmament agreement is practical and feasible, and that taking this measure will promote international trust and pave the way for further comprehensive international disarmament agreements.

    As can be seen from the reactions from all sides, the appeal of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union has won widespread sympathy from public opinion and parliamentarians in various countries. Indian Prime Minister Nehru once pointed out that each stage of gradual disarmament by countries will strengthen trust between people. Even in Western countries, more and more far-sighted politicians have expressed the need to substantially reduce military spending and get rid of the serious economic difficulties caused by the arms race. At present, the only country that stubbornly opposes disarmament and the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons is the United States. It has adopted various obstructionist tactics, so that disarmament negotiations have not been able to reach an agreement so far. It attempts to use empty talk about disarmament and emphasize so-called "new military strategies" to mislead public opinion and cover up its intensified expansion of the atomic arms race. U.S. military appropriations have increased rather than decreased, increasing by more than 3 billion U.S. dollars in the new budget year compared to the previous year. This is proof. However, many sober voices in the United States have recognized that the U.S.'s rigid attitude of obstructing disarmament is increasingly isolating it, and it must find it difficult to continue to force countries to pursue a disastrous arms expansion policy for a long time.

    The struggle of the people of all countries to achieve disarmament and prohibit atomic and hydrogen weapons is unstoppable. The parliaments of all countries, especially the U.S. Congress, which are responsible for the interests and aspirations of the people, should seriously consider the appeal of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union and take corresponding measures to promote the resolution of the most pressing disarmament issue in current international affairs. The Chinese people are willing to work together with all those who advocate disarmament to promote disarmament in all countries and consolidate lasting peace.

    支持争取裁军的斗争
    中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会常务委员会会议通过决议，对于苏联最高苏维埃就裁军问题致各国议会的呼吁书，表示完全的支持。这是中国人民一贯主张裁军、禁止原子武器和氢武器、加强国际和平的坚强意志的又一表现。如果各国议会都能采取相应的行动，就会使裁军问题僵局得以打开，军备竞赛得以停止。
    苏联最高苏维埃第四届第五次会议关于裁军问题的呼吁书，对促成迅速解决裁军问题具有重大的意义。国际局势的缓和，国际信任的发展，已为各国实行裁军、禁止原子武器和氢武器的试验和使用，提供了有利的条件。只要各大国首先是美国具有诚意，各国人民所渴望的裁减军备、禁止原子武器和氢武器的问题，就不难得到解决。苏联政府不但一贯主张实行裁军，而且在行动上，作出了榜样。苏联率先在1955年裁军六十四万人，后来又决定裁军一百二十万人。苏联这一实际行动，得到了各国舆论的赞扬和支持。其他社会主义国家，包括正处在美国所制造的分裂和备战活动的威胁之下的德意志民主共和国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和越南民主共和国在内，都采取了同样的步骤。中国也一向坚决主张世界各国特别是大国应该裁减军备，禁止原子武器和氢武器，并且在近年来也已经陆续裁减了武装部队二百七十多万人，今后还将朝着这个方向继续努力。这些事实有力地说明了苏联提出的各国不必等待国际裁军协议就自行裁减军备的倡议，是切实可行的，而采取这一措施就会促进国际间的信任，为进一步达成全面的国际裁军协议开辟坦途。
    从各方面的反应可以看出，苏联最高苏维埃的呼吁书已博得了各国舆论和议会人士的广泛同情。印度总理尼赫鲁曾指出：各国逐步裁减军备的每一阶段，都将加强人民之间的信任。即使在西方国家中，越来越多的有远见的政治家，也表示有必要大量裁减军费开支，摆脱军备竞赛所造成的严重的经济困难。现在，死硬地反对裁军和禁止原子武器和氢武器的国家，只有一个美国。它采取各种阻挠战术，以致使裁军的谈判，至今不能达成协议。它企图用裁军的空谈，强调所谓“新的军事战略”，来迷惑舆论，掩盖它加紧进行扩大原子军备竞赛。美国军事拨款有增无减，在新预算年度中反比上一年度增加三十几亿美元，这就是证明。但是，美国许多清醒的言论已经认识到，美国阻挠裁军的僵硬态度，正在使它自己日益陷于孤立，它想长此强迫各国继续奉行灾难性的扩充军备政策，不能不感到困难重重了。
    各国人民争取裁军和禁止原子武器和氢武器的斗争，势不可挡。对人民的利益和愿望负有责任的各国议会，特别是美国国会，应该认真考虑苏联最高苏维埃的呼吁书，并采取相应的措施，促成当前国际问题中最迫切的裁军问题的解决。中国人民愿同所有主张裁军的人士一起，为推动各国裁军、巩固持久和平而继续努力。
