Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, September 1st: The preliminary design planning work for the Sanmenxia Water Control Project reservoir area was basically completed at the end of August. This work began preparations in August of last year. After surveys by relevant ministries and departments of the Central Government and the provinces of Henan, Shanxi, and Shaanxi, a preliminary planning comprehensive description was made in June. The Yellow River Planning Commission, based on the data from on-site surveys by various departments, and with the strong support of relevant departments and the guidance of Soviet experts, completed this work victoriously at the end of August after two months of intense effort. The completion of this work provides technical design data for the Sanmenxia Water Control Project.

　　The survey and planning work for the reservoir area includes resident relocation in the reservoir area; the relocation of railways, highways, and telecommunications; the relocation of towns and industrial and commercial enterprises; timber harvesting and clearing; environmental sanitation and excavation and clearing of antiquities in the reservoir area; protection and greening of beaches; and the development of shipping and fisheries, and more than twenty other major projects.

　　In order to actively cooperate with the smooth progress of the Sanmenxia Water Control Project, Henan and Shaanxi provinces began work such as relocating residents from the reservoir area this spring. In order to ensure that the antiquities in the reservoir area are not damaged, the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Ministry of Culture organized an archaeological team and an excavation team for the Sanmenxia Reservoir area. They began excavating in early April this year and have excavated and cleared more than 200 ancient tombs of the Tang, Han and other dynasties by the end of August. Starting in September, excavations on a larger scale will be carried out. Other relevant departments will also actively carry out all clearing work in the reservoir area in accordance with the requirements of the comprehensive design plan.

    三门峡水库区初步设计规划基本完成
    新华社郑州1日电　三门峡水利枢纽水库区的初步设计规划工作，已在8月底基本完成。这一工作，从去年8月开始准备，经过中央有关部、院及河南、山西、陕西三省的勘查，6月底已分别作出了初步规划综合说明书。黄河规划委员会根据各部门实地勘查的资料，在各有关部门的大力支援和苏联专家的指导下，经过两个月的紧张工作，8月底已胜利完成了这一工作。这一工作的完成，为三门峡水利枢纽工程提供了技术设计资料。
    水库区的勘查规划工作，包括水库区的居民迁移；铁路，公路及电讯的改线；城镇及工商业迁移；林木采伐清理；库区的环境卫生及古物的挖掘清理；滩岸的防护和绿化；以及发展航运、渔业等二十多个重大项目。
    为积极配合三门峡水利枢纽工程的顺利进行，河南、陕西两省今年春季就开始了迁移水库区居民等工作。为保证水库区的古物不受损失，中国科学院和文化部组织了三门峡水库区考古队和挖掘队，自今年4月初开始挖掘，到8月底已挖掘清理了唐、汉等朝代的古墓二百多座。9月份起，将进行更大规模的挖掘。其他有关部门也将根据全面设计的规划要求，积极展开水库区的一切清理工作。
