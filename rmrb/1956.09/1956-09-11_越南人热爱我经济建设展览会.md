Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 10th. Over 160,000 Vietnamese people have visited the Exhibition of China's Economic Construction Achievements in the week ending last night. The exhibition opened in Hanoi on September 3rd.

The holding of the exhibition has become a major event in the lives of the people of Hanoi. This is not only due to the huge and beautiful image of the exhibition hall, which has a ground area equivalent to that of the Beijing Department Store, and the more than 3,000 exhibits, but more importantly, as many viewers expressed in their inscriptions, the common saying is: "From today's China, we see tomorrow's Vietnam."

The exhibition hall opens at 9 a.m. every day. But long before the opening, crowds gathered from all directions towards the exhibition hall not far from Tian'guang Lake. Yesterday was Sunday, and nearly 60,000 people visited. Among the visitors were people from all walks of life in Hanoi, soldiers, cadres, Catholic priests in black gowns, Buddhist nuns, and many people who had traveled long distances from Viet Bac, Central Vietnam, and other regions.

People who wanted to write inscriptions after the visit lined up at the message area, including old ladies and elementary school students. The audience was delighted and surprised by the tremendous achievements that China has made in the short few years after liberation. They said that after seeing the exhibition hall, their confidence has increased and their enthusiasm for building the motherland has become even higher.

    越南人热爱我经济建设展览会
    新华社河内10日电　在到昨天晚上为止的一星期中，有十六万以上的越南人民参观了中国经济建设成就展览会。展览会是9月3日在河内开幕的。
    展览会的举行，已经成了目前河内人民生活中的重大事件，这不仅是由于那地基面积相当于北京百货大楼的展览馆的巨大而美观的形象和那三千多件展品，更重要的是，正如许多观众在题字中所表达的一句共同的话，就是：“从今天的中国，我们看到了明天的越南”。
    展览馆每天开馆时间是上午9点。但早在开馆以前人群就从四面八方向距离天光湖不远的展览馆汇集。昨天是星期日，参观的人近六万名。观众中间有河内各阶层人民、军人、干部，也有穿着黑长衫的天主教神甫和佛教的尼姑，还有许多从越北、中越和其他地区远道前来的人。
    参观后要求题字的人们在留言处排成了长队，其中包括有老太太和小学生。观众对中国在解放后的短短几年中所取得的巨大成就感到喜悦和惊讶。他们表示，看了展览馆后，他们的信心更加增长了，建设祖国的热情也更加高涨了。
