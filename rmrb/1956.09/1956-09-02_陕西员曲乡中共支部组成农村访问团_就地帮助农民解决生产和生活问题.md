Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 30th. The Chinese Communist Party branch of Yuanqu Township, Weinan County, Shaanxi Province, recently organized a rural visiting group to understand and help farmers solve problems in production and life, which is deeply welcomed by the farmers.

　　The rural visiting group of Yuanqu Township includes eleven cadres from the Communist Youth League, women's organizations, supply and marketing cooperatives, credit cooperatives, schools, clinics, and other aspects. From August 13th to 17th, they visited farmers in Wangming, Beidong, and Beili villages. After they arrived in the villages and explained their intentions to the farmers, the farmers told them about their difficulties, problems, and opinions. Within five days, the farmers of these three villages raised questions and suggestions to the visiting group regarding the work of agricultural cooperatives such as the summer harvest distribution and the leadership of cooperative cadres, as well as opinions on living difficulties. The visiting group helped solve problems that could be solved immediately. In the summer harvest distribution, Wangming Agricultural Cooperative deducted more than 13,000 catties of grain that should not have been deducted, making the income of the cooperative members only 58% of the total income of the cooperative. After the visiting group discovered this problem, it immediately helped the cooperative recalculate and guided them to implement the principle of deducting less and distributing more, so that the income of the cooperative members accounted for 68.68% of the total income. The cooperative cadres of Beili Agricultural Cooperative had a very serious commandist style, forming disunity among the cadres and making the cooperative members afraid to speak. With the help of the visiting group, the director of the agricultural cooperative realized his mistake and consciously made a self-criticism to the cooperative members. The cooperative cadres and members were very satisfied, and their production enthusiasm immediately increased. Beidong Agricultural Cooperative needed a large cart, three ploughing cattle, and two iron harrows for production. After they raised this to the visiting group, the cadres of the supply and marketing cooperative promised to guarantee the supply. A total of sixteen farmers in these three villages had difficulties in production and life, and the credit cooperative immediately lent them one hundred yuan. The medical staff of the clinic treated twenty-eight patients in these three villages, and the fees were charged according to outpatient rates instead of home visit rates, and free treatment was also provided to poor households. Farmer Dong Wenxuan had three children who were sick and had no money for treatment. The credit cooperative lent him money, solving his difficulties.

    陕西员曲乡中共支部组成农村访问团
    就地帮助农民解决生产和生活问题
    新华社西安30日电　陕西省渭南县员曲乡的中共支部，最近组织农村访问团，了解和帮助农民解决生产和生活问题，深受农民的欢迎。
    员曲乡的农村访问团包括有青年团、妇女组织、供销合作社、信用合作社、学校、诊疗所等方面的十一名干部。他们从8月13日到17日访问了王明、北董、北李三个村的农民。他们到村子向农民说明来意后，农民就向他们谈出自己的困难问题和意见。在五天内，这三个村子的农民向访问团提出关于夏收分配、社干部领导等农业社工作的问题和建议，以及生活困难的意见。访问团对可以解决的问题都当即帮助解决。王明农业社在夏收分配中把一万三千多斤不应扣的粮食扣除了，使社员收入只占全社总收入58％。访问团发现了这个问题后，立即帮助这个社重新核算，指导他们执行少扣多分原则，使社员收入占到总收入的68.68％。北李农业社的社干部，强迫命令作风很严重，形成干部不团结、社员不敢说话。经过访问团帮助，农业社主任认识了错误，自觉地向社员做了检讨，社干部、社员都很满意，生产情绪立刻提高。北董农业社在生产上需要一辆大车、三头耕牛和两个铁耙，他们向访问团提出后，供销合作社干部答应保证供应。这三个村中共有十六户农民在生产、生活上有困难，信用合作社立即贷给他们一百元。诊疗所的医务人员对这三个村的二十八个病人进行了治疗，费用不按出诊而按门诊计收，对贫困户还免费治疗。农民董文轩有三个孩子都生了病，无钱医治，信用合作社贷给他钱，解决了困难。
