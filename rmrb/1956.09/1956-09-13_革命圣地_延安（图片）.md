    A street in Yan'an.
    Panoramic view of Yan'an. All photos in this group are taken by our reporter Zhu Bo.
    This is the cave dwelling where Chairman Mao lived in Zao Yuan. Anyone who comes here will naturally stop and admire the place where Chairman Mao worked and lived.
    The Yan'an Tractor Station is located in Qiao'ergou—the former site of the Lu Xun Academy of Arts. Tractor drivers are inspecting the machines, and male and female members of nearby agricultural cooperatives are visiting.
    Comrade Liu Huaiwang, a tractor driver, used to defend Yan'an, and today he is driving a tractor to build Yan'an.
    Yangjialing—the site of the Party Central Committee. This is the auditorium of the CPC Central Committee, where the Seventh National Congress of the Party was held.
    Comrade Shen Changlin, an alternate delegate to the Seventh National Congress of the Party, who is now the director of an agricultural production cooperative and a member of the Yan'an Prefectural Committee of the CPC, is telling visitors about the past.
