Xinhua News Agency, 12th: In recent years, in order to improve the Marxist-Leninist theoretical level of leading cadres and all party members at all levels of the party, and to meet the needs of the great socialist construction cause, the Communist Party of China has carried out theoretical education for party member cadres and education work for party members throughout the party.

Last year alone, approximately 650,000 cadres across the country received relatively systematic political theory education from party schools at all levels, party member training classes, and various specialized cadre schools.

In recent years, the CPC Central Committee and the provincial, municipal, and autonomous region party committees have successively established 51 senior party schools, intermediate party schools, and primary party schools to train cadres at all levels above the CPC district committee member level. From 1949 to the end of 1955 alone, more than 253,000 cadres graduated from party schools at all levels. This autumn, party schools at all levels will enroll approximately 30,000 cadres to participate in studies, of which the senior and intermediate party schools directly under the CPC Central Committee alone will enroll more than 6,900 students.

Party organizations at all levels also use specialized cadre schools held by various systems of government agencies to train intermediate and primary leading cadres of the party working in government agencies, so that these cadres can complete part of the theoretical courses of intermediate party schools or all the theoretical courses of primary party schools. The CPC Central Committee and the provincial, municipal, and autonomous region party committees attach particular importance to the theoretical education of senior party cadres. The CPC Central Committee stipulates that half of the senior cadres of the party should be trained in rotation at the Senior Party School of the CPC Central Committee, while the remaining senior cadres should adopt self-study methods so that they can complete the courses of the Senior Party School in five to seven years. Since this method began to be implemented in the second half of last year, according to incomplete statistics from the Central Government and 28 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions, more than 2,800 senior cadres have participated in the study. The theoretical study of the vast number of active cadres has also gradually become regular. In recent years, party organizations at all levels have established more than 1,700 spare-time political schools for middle and primary level cadres, and equipped these spare-time political schools with more than 4,500 full-time teaching cadres, so that the vast number of middle and primary level cadres can systematically study Marxist-Leninist theory in accordance with the courses of middle and primary party schools.

In recent years, party member education has also made great progress. Now, a nationwide branch education network has been formed, and various teaching systems have been initially established. Party organizations at all levels generally adopt methods such as running party member training classes, giving party lectures, and rectifying the party to educate all party members on the basic knowledge of communism and the Communist Party, as well as the party's general line during the transition period. Education on the eight conditions for party members is also systematically carried out for probationary party members and new party members. In recent years, more than 4.9 million party members across the country have received this education; of which more than 800,000 are party members working in factories, mines and enterprises, and the rest are rural party members.

Political and theoretical education for party members and party cadres has achieved remarkable results. Many cadres have significantly improved their ideological and cognitive level after completing the party school courses. Party members working in factories, mines, and enterprises, and party members in rural areas have improved their political awareness after studying the basic knowledge of communism and the Communist Party.

    提高党员干部理论水平适应社会主义建设需要
    全党开展理论教育和党员教育工作
    新华社12日讯　中国共产党最近几年来，为了提高全党各级领导干部和全体党员的马克思列宁主义理论水平，以适应伟大的社会主义建设事业的需要，在全党范围内开展了对党员干部的理论教育和党员的教育工作。
    仅去年一年，全国就有六十五万名左右的干部分别从各级党校、党员训练班以及各种专业干部学校中受到了比较系统的政治理论教育。
    几年来，中共中央和各省、市、自治区党委先后开办了五十一所高级党校、中级党校和初级党校，分别轮训中共区委委员以上的各级干部。仅1949年到1955年底，从各级党校毕业的干部就有二十五万三千多人，今年秋季各级党校招收约三万名干部参加学习，其中仅中共中央直属高级党校和中级党校就招收学员六千九百多名。
    各级党组织还通过政府机关各个系统所举办的专业干部学校，轮训在政府机关中工作的党的中级和初级领导干部，使这些干部分别学完中级党校的部分理论课程或初级党校的全部理论课程。中共中央和各省、市、自治区党委特别重视对党的高级干部的理论教育工作。中共中央规定：全党高级干部中的一半入中共中央高级党校轮训，其余的高级干部则采取自修的办法，使他们在五至七年内学完高级党校的课程。这种办法从去年下半年开始实行以来，据中央和二十八个省、市、自治区的不完全统计，已有两千八百多名高级干部参加了学习。广大在职干部的理论学习也已经逐步走上正规。各级党组织几年来为在职的中级和初级干部共举办了一千七百多所业余政治学校，为这些业余政治学校配备了四千五百多名专职教学干部，使广大在职的中级和初级干部也都能够按照中级党校和初级党校的课程系统地学习马克思列宁主义理论。
    几年来，党员教育工作也有了很大发展。现在，一个全国规模的支部教育网已经形成，并初步建立了各种教学制度。党的各级组织一般都采取开办党员训练班、上党课以及整党等方式，对全体党员进行关于共产主义和共产党的基本知识的教育，以及关于党在过渡时期的总路线等教育。对候补党员和新党员还系统地进行关于党员八项条件的教育。几年来，全国有四百九十多万党员受到了这些教育；其中有八十多万是在工厂矿山企业中工作的党员，其余是农村党员。
    对党员和党的干部进行政治理论教育，已经取得了显著成效。许多干部在学完党校课程以后，思想认识水平都有了相当的提高。在工厂、矿山、企业中工作的党员和农村中的党员，在学习了共产主义和共产党的基本知识以后，政治觉悟都有了提高。
