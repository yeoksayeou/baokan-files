Speech by Comrade Zeng Shan, Minister of Commerce

    I endorse the opening address by Comrade Mao Zedong, and I fully agree with the reports by Comrades Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, and Deng Xiaoping. I completely agree with the new Party Constitution and the proposals for the Second Five-Year Plan.

    Since the Zunyi Conference, our Party has continuously achieved great victories over the past twenty-one years. In particular, in the eleven years from the Seventh National Congress to the present, our country has thoroughly completed the bourgeois democratic revolution and basically realized the proletarian socialist revolution. During this period, the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party exposed the conspiratorial activities of the Gao Gang and Rao Shushi anti-Party alliance, greatly enhancing the revolutionary vigilance of the entire Party and strengthening the organizational nature of the entire Party, enabling our Party to advance more effectively on the road to victory. These facts eloquently demonstrate the correctness of our Party's line and policies, the correctness of the leadership of the Party Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, and the ideological and political maturity and unity of our Party.

    Under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and local Party committees, due to the development of industrial and agricultural production and the continuous improvement of people's purchasing power, and due to the efforts of all employees in the commercial sector and the cooperation of all parties, the state-owned commercial tasks stipulated in the First Five-Year Plan can be completed or even overfulfilled. However, commercial work is more complex, and our experience is insufficient. Moreover, the development of our national economy and social situation is very rapid, and various commercial measures often cannot keep up with the development of the objective situation. There are still many errors and shortcomings in our work.

A Serious Problem in Commercial Work

    In recent years, we have met the needs of the people and ensured the stability of prices in terms of the production and distribution of major daily industrial goods. In this regard, the people are basically satisfied with us. However, in recent years, in the production and distribution of general daily industrial goods, there has been a reduction in the variety of some products; the quality of some products has declined, with poor quality and high prices; the supply of certain products has not been timely, with mismatched styles and varieties, leading to stockpiles in some places and shortages in others, failing to meet the people's growing needs. In this regard, the people have raised many opinions and criticisms to us. This is a serious problem in commercial work.

    Why do these phenomena occur in the production and distribution of some daily industrial goods? To explain this issue, it is necessary to briefly review the changes that have taken place in the production and distribution of these commodities over the past seven years.

    In the early days of liberation, capitalist commerce had an advantage in our country, and socialist commerce only accounted for a small part of the commerce at that time. At that time, our market was basically a capitalist free market. In recent years, the main measures taken by socialist commerce to carry out socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce in the field of daily industrial goods are: processing and ordering from industrial departments, unified purchase and guaranteed sales, controlling sources of goods, continuously expanding state-owned wholesale business, and squeezing out capitalist wholesalers; the Ministry of Commerce, in accordance with the purchase and sales plans approved by the state, conducts planned distribution and unified allocation of commodities through the supply meetings of professional company systems, and supplies sources of goods to retail commerce through methods such as wholesale, distribution, and consignment sales. The facts of the past few years have proved that these measures were necessary at that time. They not only played a huge role in restoring and developing industrial and agricultural production, stabilizing market prices, and ensuring the supply of urban and rural people's needs, but also largely cut off the connection between urban capitalist industry and private commerce, strengthened the socialist economy's leadership in the market, and gradually brought capitalist industry and commerce into the track of state capitalism, creating favorable conditions for the implementation of the overall joint state-private ownership of capitalist industry and commerce in early 1956. However, this approach has brought some negative factors to a certain extent, and we have errors and shortcomings in our work, failing to overcome the impact of these negative factors in a timely manner. This is reflected in:

    1. Since all the products of the industrial sector are processed, purchased, and sold by the commercial sector, some factories do not care about the sales of products in the market as much as they did when they sold them themselves, and therefore are not enthusiastic about improving product quality and continuously increasing new styles and varieties that meet the needs of the people. The original diverse styles and varieties have been simplified due to processing and guaranteed sales, becoming mass-produced goods, unable to meet the diverse needs of urban and rural people.

    2. The commercial sector does not have a thorough understanding of production and sales conditions, the quantity and quality of raw materials cannot be strictly guaranteed during processing; the price policy has not been well implemented with high quality and high price, and inferior quality and low price; and necessary promotion and support have not been given to the trial production of new varieties. There are shortcomings in the method of calculating processing fees, and sometimes when the cost of products is reduced, the industrial sector does not receive the increased profits it should have. These errors and shortcomings in work have also affected the enthusiasm of the industrial sector for improving product quality.

    3. Both the industrial and commercial sectors emphasize planning, but some plans are indeed not formulated properly. In fact, there are many types of daily industrial goods, with complex styles and specifications, and people's needs are constantly changing, making it impossible to fully incorporate them into the plan. Sometimes, the plans are too rigid, which not only fails to meet the needs of the people well but also causes products to be out of stock or stockpiled.

    4. The method of allocating and distributing goods from top to bottom within the state-owned commercial system often prevents grassroots units from organizing sources of goods according to the needs of residents, limiting their enthusiasm for operation, resulting in long-term problems such as untimely allocation of goods and mismatched styles and varieties.

    If we could overcome the shortcomings and errors in our work in a timely manner, the role played by these negative factors would be appropriately reduced. If we had not squeezed out private wholesalers, especially small wholesalers, after state-owned commerce had gained an absolute advantage in the industrial commodity wholesale market at the end of 1954, but adopted the method of overall joint state-private ownership for wholesalers, allowing them to continue to undertake the wholesale business of distributing goods under the leadership of state-owned commerce; if we had not overly concentrated many small factories before and after the implementation of overall joint state-private ownership in industry, and had not made their production plans too rigid, allowing them to have direct business contacts with various companies and shops in a decentralized manner, producing flexibly according to market needs; if we could have expanded the scope of self-selection from bottom to top in the commercial sector earlier, so that grassroots stores could appropriately purchase goods according to the needs of the people, then the current situation of declining quality, reducing styles and varieties, and mismatches and delays in daily industrial goods may have been better.

The Guiding Principles and Methods to Be Adopted

    After the implementation of overall joint state-private ownership and fixed interest rates in capitalist industry and commerce, fundamental changes have taken place in the relations of production. We have the conditions to change these situations, and the broad masses of consumers are also eagerly demanding that we comprehensively solve the problems of production and distribution of daily industrial goods. I fully agree with the central political report's proposal to change many of the measures regarding purchase and sales relations adopted during the period of utilizing, restricting, and transforming capitalist industry and commerce, based on the basic completion of the socialist transformation of private commerce, and to allow the existence of some free markets led by the state within a certain range of the unified socialist market. This is a major guiding principle aimed at improving the current situation of daily industrial goods production and distribution in our country. To specifically implement this guiding principle, I believe the following methods should be adopted:

Adopting Different Business Methods

    (1) We can divide daily industrial goods into two major categories according to the nature of the products, supply and demand, and their relationship to people's lives, and adopt different business methods.

    The first category includes large-volume commodities needed by the people, such as sugar, cotton yarn, fabrics, paper, coal, cigarettes, matches, etc. This category accounts for most of the output value of all daily industrial goods. Its characteristics are fewer varieties, simpler styles and specifications, and the quantity and variety can be directly planned, and the specifications and quality can be uniformly regulated. Except for grain, these commodities are the basic forces for stabilizing prices. Therefore, the commercial sector should still use the method of unified purchase or guaranteed sales for the industrial sector for these commodities, but it must change the original processing relationship into a buying and selling relationship. In addition, there are some commodities that are not large-volume commodities but are in short supply. For the purpose of reasonable distribution between regions, the commercial sector should also conduct guaranteed sales. We believe that for factories producing this type of industrial products, the industrial sector should strictly stipulate the quality indicators of the goods. Failure to complete the quality indicators should not be considered a comprehensive completion of the plan; a plan for increasing the production of new varieties should be formulated so that several new varieties appear on the market every year to adapt to the constantly changing needs of the people. The commercial and industrial sectors should, based on quality indicators, negotiate a pricing method of high quality and high price, and inferior quality and low price, and a price system for rewarding the trial production and trial sales of new products. The commercial sector must constantly reflect the needs of the people to the industrial sector, and the industrial sector must produce according to the needs of the people. Both the commercial and industrial sectors should regard meeting the growing needs of the people for daily industrial goods as a noble task in their work, and closely cooperate in their work to prevent and overcome any departmentalism. For varieties in this category that are in short supply, the commercial system should still maintain a top-down distribution relationship in terms of quantity, but the specific styles, varieties, quality, and specifications can be selected from bottom to top through the supply meetings of professional companies or other appropriate forms.

    The second category includes scattered industrial goods with complex styles and varieties, mainly daily necessities, some knitwear, and cultural supplies. There are many types of this kind of commodity, but the output value is not large, only accounting for 20% to 30% of the total value operated by the Ministry of Commerce system. For this type of commodity, the commercial sector can give priority to purchasing from factories according to market needs. That is to say, the products of the factory should be sold to wholesale stations at all levels and even to grassroots stores first. For the remaining commodities selected for purchase, the factory can entrust the commercial sector to sell on consignment, or it can sell them itself. When the commercial sector sells on consignment, it should only charge a lower handling fee. The commercial sector should still be responsible to the market and serve the needs of production and the people, try to select and purchase as much as possible, and actively promote sales, so that the industrial sector is happy to sell through the commercial sector, and should not promote the development of self-sales by the industrial sector, which would affect the specialization of industrial production. For this type of industrial product, there should not be strict plans in terms of production quantity and variety specifications. Only a rough reference number should be specified, allowing factories to change the production plan of varieties, styles, and specifications at any time according to market needs. The state only needs to properly control the allocation of raw materials to prevent blind development. In terms of production organization, a considerable number of small factories should be retained, and they should not be merged and concentrated, so that they can play a flexible role in production under the unified leadership of industrial professional companies to meet market needs. For this type of commodity, the wholesale and all retail units within the commercial system must implement free selection from bottom to top, and hard matching and distribution are prohibited. For the remaining commodities selected for purchase, wholesale departments are allowed to entrust nearby retail departments to sell on consignment or take other measures to organize sales promotion.

    Regarding the ex-factory price of products, whether they are purchased, sold, or selected by the commercial sector, they are determined by the state or negotiated by the industrial and commercial sectors under the principles stipulated by the state. The portion of the current excessive commercial profits should be transferred to the industrial sector; and those that are profitable for industry and loss-making for commerce should also be adjusted reasonably. The commercial sector should only obtain low profits in addition to the necessary expenses, which is conducive to the industrial sector to increase production, improve styles, varieties, and quality specifications, and also conducive to the commercial sector to increase sources of goods and expand new varieties to supply the needs of the people, and further improve its own business management.

Correspondingly Change the System of State-Owned Commerce

    (2) The implementation of the free selection method is a major change in the production, distribution, and industrial and commercial relations of daily industrial goods. In this regard, we still lack more practical experience. Therefore, in terms of implementation steps, we must select several industries and several types of commodities for pilot projects first, and then implement them in batches and in stages with preparation and steps. To implement selection, the system of state-owned commerce must also undergo corresponding changes. We are currently considering the following aspects:

    (1) The current planning system must be changed accordingly; the accounting system must be simplified; and the financial management system, in addition to retaining the provision that cash must be deposited in the state bank, requires the restoration of the original flexible payment methods in our banks to facilitate the circulation of commodities.

    (2) The state-owned commercial system must adjust wholesale stations at all levels accordingly based on the natural and reasonable flow direction of commodities, and plan the respective responsibilities and close combination of wholesale and retail institutions to facilitate the selection work.

    (3) It is recommended that a special price agency be established under the leadership of the State Council and people's committees at all levels to manage commodity prices. If industrial and commercial departments believe that it is necessary to adjust prices, they should submit proposals to the price agency after careful study. The agency managing prices should fully consider the overall situation in mastering price policies, taking into account both national construction and the interests of the people, and strictly control the overall level of prices, stipulate the prices of various standard commodities, and strictly implement the principle of pricing according to quality. From the ex-factory price of commodities to the market price, it should be managed. Commodities that need to be increased or decreased in price should be approved by the central and local price agencies. Damaged and deteriorated commodities can be disposed of at reduced prices by companies and stores in accordance with the methods already stipulated by the Ministry of Commerce.

    (4) The quality of the goods is entirely the responsibility of the industrial sector. The wholesale stations or company stores of the commercial sector only accept the goods according to the contract or agreement signed with the industrial sector. If there are products that do not meet the requirements of the contract, the industrial sector shall be responsible for returning and replacing them. Commodity trademarks are determined by the factory itself, and the commercial sector shall not set its own trademarks.

Strengthening the Leadership of the Commercial Sector

    (3) After the implementation of selection, the negative factors brought about by the current processing and ordering and unified allocation will be greatly improved. However, selection is a major change in the method of commodity distribution, which will inevitably have a certain impact on the market. Currently, we can imagine the following points:

    (1) There must be a certain degree of adjustment in the price difference between regions for selected commodities. Some places will slightly reduce the regional price difference due to changes in transportation routes; some commodities, due to the excessive reduction in regional price differences in the past due to restrictions on capitalist wholesalers' trafficking, will inappropriately expand some, which will hinder free selection. Whether to expand or reduce, the commercial sector should put forward opinions and report to the price management agency of the same level of government for approval before implementation.

    (2) After the implementation of selection based on quality and price, the price difference between commodity qualities will inevitably increase somewhat, which is beneficial to rewarding advanced factories and urging backward factories to improve production. For some factories with backward production, if difficulties arise due to losses, the industrial sector should coordinate and resolve them.

    (3) After the implementation of selection, the situation of retail institutions purchasing goods from other places will be greatly restored and developed, the role of cities as distribution centers will also be restored and strengthened, and the route of commodity circulation will be reorganized to a certain extent according to the natural flow direction, which will all cause certain changes in the market. The commercial sector should still frequently ask for instructions and report to Party committees and governments at all levels, and require Party and government at all levels to strengthen their leadership over commercial work, strengthen the management of prices, and strengthen the responsibility of commercial and industrial departments for stabilizing the market. Wholesale departments cannot reduce their original responsibilities due to selection, and retail departments should realize that the implementation of selection will further increase their responsibility for ensuring the supply of local people's needs and stabilizing prices.

    (4) We should also estimate that people's needs are constantly changing, and the plan arrangements made by the planning department for some products and the products produced by the production department may not fully meet the requirements of the market and the needs of residents; the commercial sector may not fully understand the needs of residents. Therefore, after the implementation of selection, there will still be situations where goods are not matched or timely. However, this situation will inevitably promote the commercial sector to deepen its understanding and research on the needs of residents, and timely select and purchase the right goods to facilitate the supply of people's needs, and at the same time, it can also promote the planning department to improve the planning level and the production department to quickly improve production. Therefore, the situation of mismatched and untimely goods may not be completely eliminated after the implementation of selection, but it will be significantly improved compared to the present.

    改进日用工业品的生产和分配工作
    商业部部长　曾山同志的发言
    我拥护毛泽东同志的开幕词，我完全同意刘少奇、周恩来、邓小平三位同志的报告。完全同意新的党章和第二个五年计划的建议。
    自从遵义会议以来，我们党在二十一年间，不断取得伟大的胜利，特别是从第七次代表大会到现在十一年间，我国彻底地完成了资产阶级民主革命，又在基本上实现了无产阶级社会主义革命。在这个期间，党的七届四中全会揭发了高岗、饶漱石反党联盟的阴谋活动，大大地提高了全党的革命警觉性，加强了全党的组织性，使我们党更能在胜利的道路上前进。这些事实，雄辩地说明了我们党的路线和政策的正确，说明了以毛泽东同志为首的党中央领导的正确，说明了我们党在思想上、政治上的成熟和团结一致。
    在党中央和各地党委的正确领导下，由于工农业生产的发展和人民购买力的不断提高，由于商业部门全体职工的努力和各方面的协作，第一个五年计划所规定的国营商业任务，是可以完成以至超额完成的。但商业工作比较复杂，我们的经验不足，而我国的国民经济和社会情况发展很快，商业上的各种措施，往往赶不上客观形势的发展，我们工作中还存在着很多的错误和缺点。商业工作中的一个严重问题
    几年来，我们在主要日用工业品的生产和分配方面，满足了人民的需要，保证了物价的稳定，在这方面，人民对我们基本上是满意的。但是，近几年来，在一般日用工业品的生产和分配过程中，有部分产品的品种减少；若干产品的质量下降、质次价高；某些产品供应不及时，花色品种不对路，这里积压、那里脱销，不能适应人民日益增长的需要；在这方面，人民对我们提出了不少的意见和批评。这是商业工作中的一个严重问题。
    为什么一部分日用工业品的生产和分配中会发生这些现象？为了说明这个问题，应当简单回顾一下过去七年来在这些商品生产和分配上所发生的变化。
    在解放初期，资本主义商业在我国占有优势，社会主义商业只占当时商业的一个很小部分。那时候，我国的市场，基本上是资本主义的自由市场。几年来，社会主义商业为了对资本主义工商业进行社会主义改造，在日用工业品方面所采取的主要措施，是通过对工业部门的加工定货，统购包销，掌握货源，不断扩展国营批发业务，排挤了资本主义批发商；商业部按照国家批准的购销计划，通过专业公司系统的供应会议，进行商品的有计划分配和统一调拨，通过批售、经销、代销等方式，对零售商业供应货源。几年来的事实证明：这些措施，在当时是必要的，它不仅对恢复和发展工农业生产，稳定市场物价，保证城乡人民需要的供应，起了巨大的作用，而且在很大程度上割断了城市资本主义工业和私营商业的联系，加强了社会主义经济对市场的领导，把资本主义工商业逐步纳入了国家资本主义的轨道，并为一九五六年年初资本主义工商业实行全行业公私合营创造了有利的条件。但是这种做法，在一定程度上带来了一些消极因素，而我们工作上又有错误和缺点，没有能够及时克服这些消极因素的影响，这表现在：
    一、工业部门的产品全部由商业部门加工、统购、包销，就产生了一部分工厂不像自销时候那样关心产品在市场上的销路，因而也并不热心于提高产品质量和不断增加适应人民需要的新的花色品种。原来多种多样的花色品种，由于加工、包销而简单化了，变成了大路货，不能适合城乡人民各种不同的需要。
    二、商业部门对产销情况了解不透，加工时原料供应的数量和质量不能严格保证；在价格政策上没有很好贯彻执行优质优价、次质次价；对试制新品种，没有给以必要的推动和支持；核算工缴费的办法有缺点，有时产品的成本降低了，工业部门没有得到应该增加的利润。这些工作上的错误和缺点，也都影响到工业部门对提高产品质量的积极性。
    三、工业部门和商业部门都各自强调计划性，而某些计划确实订得不恰当。实际上日用工业品种类繁多，花色、规格复杂，人民的需要经常变化，不可能完全纳入计划。有时计划订得过死，不但不能很好满足人民的需要，还会造成产品的脱销与积压。
    四、国营商业内部自上而下调拨、分配商品的办法，常常使基层单位不能根据居民需要来组织货源，限制了他们的经营积极性，以致长期地存在着商品调拨不及时，花色、品种不对路等等情况。
    假如我们能够及时克服工作中的缺点和错误，是会适当缩小这些消极因素所发生的作用的。如果我们在一九五四年年底，国营商业已经取得了工业商品批发阵地的绝对优势以后，就不把私营批发商，特别是小批发商排挤掉，而对批发商采取全行业公私合营的办法，使他们在国营商业领导之下，继续担负着分发商品的批发业务；如果我们在工业实行全行业公私合营前后，不把许多小工厂过于集中起来，不把它们的生产计划订得过死，让它们分散地同各个公司、商店直接发生业务联系，随市场需要，灵活生产；如果我们能够早一些扩大商业部门自下而上选购的范围，使基层商店能够适当地根据人民需要来进货，那末目前这种日用工业品质量下降，花色品种减少，货不对路、不及时，等等情况，可能会好一些。
    应该采取的方针和办法
    在资本主义工商业实行全行业公私合营并定息以后，生产关系起了根本的变化，我们完全有条件改变这些情况，广大消费者也迫切要求我们全面解决日用工业品的生产和分配问题。我完全同意中央政治报告中所提出的：在私营商业的社会主义改造已经基本完成的基础上，改变过去在利用、限制、改造资本主义工商业时期所采取的许多关于购销关系的措施，在统一的社会主义市场的一定范围内，允许国家领导的某些自由市场存在的原则。这是针对着改进我国现有日用工业品生产和分配状况的一项有重大意义的方针。具体贯彻这一方针，我认为应当采取以下办法：
    采取不同的经营办法
    （一）我们可以根据产品的性质、供求情况和对人民生活的关系，把日用工业品分成两大类，采取不同的经营办法。
    第一类，是人民需要的大宗商品，例如食糖、棉纱、布匹、纸张、煤炭、卷烟、火柴等等。这一类商品占全部日用工业品产值的大部分。它的特点是品种少，花色、规格比较简单，数量和品种可以直接计划，规格和质量可以统一规定，除粮食外，这些商品是稳定物价的基本力量。因此，这类商品，商业部门对工业部门仍然应该进行统购或包销的办法，只是必须改变原来的加工关系为买卖关系。此外，还有一些虽然不是大宗商品，但是属于供不应求的商品，为了地区间的合理分配，也应该由商业部门进行包销。我们认为：工业部门对于生产这一类工业品的工厂，应当严格规定商品的质量指标，完不成质量指标的，不能算作全面完成计划；应当订出增产新品种的计划，使每年在市场上出现若干新品种，以适应人民经常变化的需要。商业部门和工业部门应当根据质量指标，商定优质优价、次质次价的作价办法和奖励试制、试销新产品的价格制度。商业部门必须经常向工业部门反映人民需要，工业部门必须根据人民的需要进行生产。商业部门和工业部门都应当把满足人民日益增长的日用工业品的需要，当成自己工作中的崇高的任务，并且在工作中密切配合，防止和克服任何本位主义思想。对于这一类商品中供不应求的品种，商业系统内部在数量上仍然应该保持自上而下的分配关系，但具体的花色品种、质量规格，可通过专业公司的供应会议或其他适当形式，自下而上进行选择。
    第二类，是花色品种复杂的零星工业品，主要是日用百货、一部分针织品和文化用品。这类商品种类很多，但产值不大，只占商业部系统经营总值的百分之二十到三十。这一类商品，可以由商业部门根据市场需要，向工厂优先选购。那就是说，工厂的产品，应该优先出售给各级批发站以至基层商店。选购剩下的商品，工厂可以委托商业部门代销，也可以自销。商业部门代销时，只应收取较低的手续费。商业部门对这一类选购的商品，仍然应该本着对市场负责，为生产、为人民需要服务的精神，尽量选购，积极推销，使工业部门乐于经由商业部门销售，而不应促使工业部门发展自销，影响工业生产的专业化。对于这一类工业品，在生产数量上、品种规格上，不应有严格的计划，只规定一个轮廓的参考数字，允许工厂根据市场的需要，随时变动品种、花色、规格的生产计划，国家仅仅在原料分配上加以适当的掌握，以防止盲目发展；在生产组织上，应当保留相当数量的小工厂，不要合并和集中，使他们在工业专业公司的统一领导下，能够发挥生产上的灵活性，以适应市场的需要。对于这一类商品，商业系统内部的批发和一切零售单位，必须实行自下而上的自由选购，禁止硬性搭配和分派。选购剩余的商品，允许批发部门委托附近的零售部门代销或者采取其他办法组织推销。
    关于产品的出厂价格，不论是由商业部门统购、包销的或者是选购的，都由国家规定或者在国家规定的原则下由工业部门与商业部门商定。目前商业利润过大的部分，应该转移到工业部门去；而工业有利、商业亏本的，也应该合理调整。商业部门除必要的费用外，只应得到低的利润，这样既有利于工业部门增加生产，改进花色品种和质量规格，也有利于商业部门增加货源和扩大新品种，供应人民需要，并进一步改进自己的经营管理。
    相应改变国营商业的制度
    （二）实行自由选购的办法，是日用工业品的生产、分配和工商关系上一个重大的改变。在这方面，我们还缺乏更多的实际经验，因此，在实行步骤上，必须选择若干行业和若干种商品先行试点，然后分批分期地、有准备有步骤地实行。要实行选购，国营商业的制度方面，也必须作相应的改变。我们现在考虑到的，有下列几个方面：
    （1）现行的计划制度要相应地改变；会计制度要简化；财务管理制度，除保留现金必须存入国家银行的规定外，要求恢复我国银行中原有的灵活支付办法，以利商品流通。
    （2）国营商业系统，必须根据商品自然的、合理的流转方向，相应地调整各级批发站，规划批发机构、零售机构各自的职责和密切结合的相互关系，以便利选购工作的进行。
    （3）建议在国务院和各级人民委员会领导下，设立专门的物价机构，来管理商品的价格。工商业部门认为有调整价格必要的，经过慎重研究后，向物价机构提出建议。管理物价的机构，对物价政策的掌握，要全面考虑，既要照顾国家建设，又要照顾人民利益，并要严格掌握物价的总水平，规定各种标准商品的价格，严格实行按质论价的原则。从商品的出厂价格到市场价格，都要加以管理。需要涨价和落价的商品，应该由中央和各级物价机构批准。残损变质商品，可由公司和商店按照商业部已规定的办法，降价处理。
    （4）商品的质量，完全由工业部门负责。商业部门的批发站或公司商店，只根据和工业部门所订的合同或协议规定，验收商品。如果有不符合合同所规定的产品，工业部门要包退包换。商品商标，由工厂自定，商业部门不得另定商标。
    加强商业部门的领导
    （三）在实行选购以后，对现在这种加工订货、统一调拨所带来的消极因素，会得到很大程度的改善。但选购是商品分配方法上一个重大的变革，对市场上必然会有一定程度的影响。目前我们可以设想到有下列几点：
    （1）选购的商品，在地区之间的差价上，要有一定幅度的调整。有些地方将会因运输路线的改变而使地区差价稍有降低；有些商品，由于过去限制资本主义批发商贩运而过多地缩小了地区差价的，不适当扩大一些，会妨碍自由选购。不论扩大或降低，都应由商业部门提出意见，报告同级政府的物价管理机构批准后执行。
    （2）实行按质论价选购以后，商品品质之间的差价难免要扩大一些，这对奖励先进，督促落后工厂改进生产，都是有利的。对有些生产落后的工厂，因亏本而发生困难，应由工业部门调剂解决。
    （3）实行选购之后，零售机构向外地进货的情况会有极大程度的恢复和发展，城市的集散作用也将恢复和加强，商品流通的路线会根据自然流转方向有一定程度的改组，这都会引起市场的一定变化。商业部门仍应经常向各级党委和政府请示报告，并要求各级党政加强对商业工作的领导，加强对物价的管理，加强商业部门和工业部门对稳定市场的责任。批发部门不能因选购而减轻原有的责任，零售部门则更应该认识到实行选购以后，更加重了自己对保证供应当地人民需要和稳定物价的责任。
    （4）我们也应该估计到，人民的需要经常变化，计划部门对某些产品的计划安排和生产部门生产出来的某些产品，不一定完全适合市场的要求和居民的需要；商业部门对居民需要也不一定了解得很透彻。因此，实行选购以后，仍然会有货不对路、不及时等情况。但这种情况，由于实行了自由选购，必然会促使商业部门加深对居民需要的了解和研究，及时选购对路的商品，以利供应人民需要，同时也能促使计划部门提高计划水平和生产部门迅速改进生产。因此，货不对路、不及时等情况，在实行选购以后，虽然不容易完全消灭，但比起现在来，会有很显著的改善。
