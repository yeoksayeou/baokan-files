    Learn From Each Other's Strengths and Improve Together

    In the National Music Week concerts, the performances of some famous singers have improved significantly compared to the past, which is very exciting for us.
    Huang Hong, a folk singer from Yunnan, has more even control of her breath in her voice usage than before. When she sings high notes, she is not as tight as before, but much more relaxed, so her artistic expression has been greatly enhanced. Her singing was more enthusiastically welcomed by the audience. There is also the Miao singer A Pao, whose singing originally had a strong national style and characteristics, and this performance has also improved compared to the past, especially when she sang "Malang Song". This is a love song depicting a pair of lovers talking intimately under the moonlight, with a beautiful melody and lingering emotion. A Pao very naturally and delicately expressed the poetic life of the ethnic minorities, especially her melodious and slight singing, gentle and lingering, and people cannot help but be drawn into a wonderful artistic conception. Their progress in singing shows that in terms of vocal training, they have absorbed some of the advantages of Western singing methods on the basis of their original singing methods, and also enriched artistic expression.
    Similarly, the famous singers Zhou Xiaoyan and Yu Yixuan, who study Western singing methods, were also unanimously satisfied with their improved singing art during this Music Week. They sang folk songs with clearer pronunciation than before, their mastery of the language was more natural, and the emotional expression was more authentic, giving people a sense of intimacy. This also shows that singers who study Western singing methods are working hard to learn from the folk, so that their singing can gradually tend to be nationalized, which is a gratifying thing.
    These specific facts show that in order to develop China's vocal music art, singers who study national singing methods and singers who study Western singing methods should not be mutually opposed and exclusive, but should respect and learn from each other; learn from each other's strengths and make progress together. In particular, singers who study Western singing methods should work hard to learn from national traditions like Zhou and Yu, so that their singing can be more national in character. Only in this way can our vocal music art "let a hundred flowers bloom" and be full of fragrance.

    取长补短，共同提高
  　舒模
    在全国音乐周的音乐会中，有些名歌唱家的演唱，比以前有了显著进步，这是很使我们感到兴奋的。
    云南民歌歌唱家黄虹，在声音运用上，气息的控制比以前更均匀了。她唱高音的时候，也不像以前那样紧涩，松得多了，因此她的艺术表现力大大增强了。她的歌声受到了听众更热烈的欢迎。还有苗族歌唱家阿泡，她的演唱原来就具有浓厚的民族风格和特色，这次的演唱也比过去有了提高，尤其在她演唱“马郎歌”时更显著。这是一首描写一对情人在月光下谈知心话的恋歌，曲调优美，感情缠绵。阿泡非常自然而细腻地表现了兄弟民族的富有诗意的生活情调，特别是她的悠扬而轻微的歌声，婉转缠绵，人们不能不被引入美妙的意境中去。她们演唱上的进步，可以看出是由于在声音训练方面，在原有唱法的基础上吸取了一些西洋唱法的优点，还丰富了艺术表现。
    同样，学习西洋唱法的名歌唱家周小燕、喻宜萱，在这次音乐周中，大家也一致满意地认为她们的演唱艺术也进步了。她们演唱的民歌，吐字比以前更清晰，语言的掌握也较自然，感情表现得真实，使人听来有亲切之感。这也说明学习西洋唱法的歌唱家，是在努力向民间学习，使自己的歌唱能够日渐趋向民族化，这是多么可喜的事。
    这些具体事实说明了，要使我国声乐艺术得到发展，学习民族唱法的和学习西洋唱法的歌唱家，不是相互对立、排斥，而是应该相互尊重、学习；取长补短，求得共同提高。尤其是学习西洋唱法的歌唱家，更要像周、喻两位那样努力地向民族传统学习，使得自己的歌唱更具有民族特色。只有这样，我们声乐艺术才能“百花齐放”，朵朵芬芳。
