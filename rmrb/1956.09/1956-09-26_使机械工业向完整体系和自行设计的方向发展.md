Develop the Machine Industry Towards a Complete System and Self-Designed Direction

Speech by Comrade Huang Jing, Director of the State Technology Commission and Minister of the First Ministry of Machine Building

I fully agree with the three reports of the Central Committee. The Central Committee pointed out that the main requirement of China's socialist industrialization is to basically build a complete industrial system in about three five-year plan periods; and pointed out that the development of the machine industry is one of the main links in building this complete industrial system.

The machinery and equipment needed by various economic sectors in construction are not only large in quantity and diverse in types, but also change rapidly with technological development. For example, the construction of an iron and steel joint enterprise requires hundreds of thousands of tons of equipment of thousands of varieties; at the same time, many enterprises that cooperate with it, such as coal mines, power stations, transportation and urban public facilities, also need a lot of equipment. Our machine industry had a very weak foundation. Although it has developed greatly in the past few years with the assistance of the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries, its scale is still small and there are still many shortcomings, especially large, precise, and complete sets of equipment, most of which cannot be manufactured yet. This is the fundamental reason why our country's machine self-sufficiency rate is still very low. In the last century, Marx said: "Large-scale industry must control its most special means of production, namely the machines themselves; it must use machines to manufacture machines. Only in this way can it have its appropriate technical foundation and its own footing." It can be seen that the machine industry must strive to overcome its own weaknesses and rapidly develop and grow, so that it can supply the main equipment in national construction. Otherwise, it will be impossible to establish a complete industrial system.

In the second five-year plan, the Central Committee proposed that special attention should be paid to the construction of the machine industry and the metallurgical industry, and that the development of the machine industry should focus on the development of large-scale equipment, special machine tools, instruments, and the radio industry. We believe that these are all completely correct.

I would like to offer some opinions on two important issues in the development of China's machine industry: transforming the repair and assembly industry into a manufacturing industry and developing from imitation to self-design.

(1) The Problem of Transforming the Repair and Assembly Industry into a Manufacturing Industry

To transition from repair and assembly to manufacturing, it is necessary to determine the professional production direction of the enterprise; establish the normal production order of the enterprise; establish a set of formal manufacturing methods and systems; and conduct technical transformation of the enterprise.

China's machine industry has developed to a certain extent in the past century. A considerable technical force has grown up, and this technical force is based on veteran workers with generations of technical traditions and experienced technical personnel. However, in old China, the machine industry was basically a colonial and semi-colonial repair and assembly industry. Except for a few factories that could make some ordinary machines, most of them could only make some parts and components, or only do assembly work, and could not manufacture complete machines; the equipment was old and incomplete; the production tasks were messy and there was no fixed profession, whatever came was done; there were only production workshops, no tool workshops and other auxiliary workshops; production was irregular: there were no formal product drawings, no certain quality standards, work depended solely on the workers' own skills, and there were no process regulations; if the parts made were not suitable, they were filed, scraped, hammered, and pieced together. Such production, of course, has poor quality, low efficiency, high cost, and cannot produce complete or complete sets of products. Therefore, after we carried out democratic reforms in the original factories and consolidated the new relations of production, the first problem we encountered was how to transform this irregular repair and assembly machine industry into a regular manufacturing industry.

When we started manufacturing, we did not yet have the ability to design products, so we had to start with imitation. We have the technical assistance of the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries: experts were sent, and new equipment and product drawings and technical materials were provided; the Party Central Committee made overall plans for socialist construction and the leadership of party committees at all levels; and the broad masses of workers were active in socialist construction. These superior conditions enabled us to quickly begin manufacturing new machines.

To transition from repair and assembly to manufacturing, we carried out the following tasks:

First, determine the professional production direction of the enterprise. In 1952, under the direct leadership of the former Central Finance and Economics Committee, a rough division of labor was made for the national state-owned machinery factories. Later, after annual adjustments, most of the state-owned factories now have a professional production direction. This is a prerequisite for changing a repair and assembly factory into a manufacturing factory. Because the problem of what the factory manufactures is solved, all technical and organizational work in production has a basis. This work has not yet been fully completed, and the professional direction of some factories has not been fully determined, or it is not determined properly, and it often changes. In the past few years, we have not arranged the mechanical industry of various ministries, localities, and joint state-private enterprises well enough. In today's new situation of joint state-private ownership of the entire industry, it is necessary to make further proper arrangements for the national mechanical industry. In addition to considering specialization, attention should also be paid to organizing considerable enterprises to undertake the task of manufacturing sporadic products and repairs. This is a very complex task, and we still lack detailed research.

Second, establish the normal production order of the enterprise. To produce a machine composed of thousands of parts qualifiedly, and to make full use of production capacity to achieve more, faster, better, and more economical results, it is impossible without a good production order. To establish production order, we first implemented operation plans to organize the production activities of each workshop; second, we strengthened production preparation, especially the technical preparation of production, so that the work of various departments of the factory could cooperate with the production of the workshop; and then clarified the division of labor of the factory at all levels. In this way, from the production preparation of various departments of the factory to the delivery of finished products, the entire production process can be reasonably organized. Although this work has made great achievements in the past few years, it is still affected by the fact that the current production plan is not stable, there are still shortcomings in production supply and collaboration, and the product development plan has not been done well.

Third, establish a set of formal manufacturing methods and systems. When we first started imitating, the product quality was very poor, and some factories could not produce qualified products for a long time. This was because we had not yet mastered a set of formal manufacturing methods and systems. To manufacture a new product formally, there must be a set of technical documents as the basis, and there must be a set of formal systems to ensure its implementation; and the formulation of these documents must be verified through trial production, such as whether the drawings are correct, what kind of processing method is appropriate, whether the process regulations are practical, etc., all must be confirmed through trial production. We didn't understand these principles at the time, and we didn't point them out to the factories in time. This is the main reason why many factories took detours and caused production chaos. After everyone realized the necessity of formal production, under the leadership of party committees at all levels, through the efforts of the masses of workers, overcoming repair and assembly habits, mastering the methods of formal production, and establishing formal production systems, the situation changed. For example, the Shanghai Steam Turbine Factory mastered the manufacturing technology of relatively complex and precise products like steam turbines through such a process. The work done by each factory in this area is still very unbalanced. Especially in emphasizing formal production and learning from foreign experience, we have not paid enough attention to summarizing the experience created by the masses and how to combine foreign experience with the specific conditions of production. These are the shortcomings that need to be overcome urgently in this work at present.

Fourth, carry out the technical transformation of enterprises. After the enterprise has undergone the above work, although it has initially established a production order and the technical level has been improved, its technical foundation is still very weak. Although the factory has been initially specialized, most of the equipment is still versatile and inefficient, lacking the necessary precision machining and special machines. The degree of mechanization is very low, and there is a lot of manual labor. The layout of the workshop and the arrangement of equipment are unreasonable and not suitable for the requirements of specialized production. Therefore, the consumption of man-hours and materials in production is high, and the quality is not easy to guarantee.

The more prominent problem is the weak technical support. The so-called technical support refers to the auxiliary workshops and the technical institutions of the factory necessary for technical preparation and production guarantee. Design and process work cannot keep up with the requirements of the workshop; the tool workshop is very weak, and the supply of tooling is not available; the mechanical repair workshop has insufficient capacity, and the equipment is often out of repair and cannot maintain accuracy; the material testing, parts and finished product inspection, product and process test research institutions, etc. are not sound; the measurement standards are not unified; and standardization work has not yet been carried out. The backwardness of these works has limited the improvement of production efficiency and technical level.

In response to these situations, a systematic technical transformation of the enterprise must be carried out, including: supplementing the strength of auxiliary workshops such as tools and repairs; establishing testing, measurement, inspection, and other work; strengthening various technical institutions; improving process and production organization, especially organizing production lines according to the manufacturing and assembly process of product parts; repairing and refitting old equipment; adding necessary new and special equipment; and appropriately mechanizing casting, forging workshops and heavy labor. We must correct the past tendency of "only caring about the front and neglecting the rear."

If the enterprise undergoes these transformations, it will be able to gradually change the backward technical situation. Taking the Shenyang Second Machine Tool Factory as an example, in 1955, production was suspended for several months due to poor quality. After a comprehensive technical transformation, the technical level and organizational level of the factory have been greatly improved, and not only the quality has improved, but the production capacity has also increased by one time compared with before the transformation.

We recognized the systematic technical transformation of old factories relatively late and started late. In the past, investment in old factories was reduced too much. It was not until last year that this work began to be carried out more systematically. We plan to gradually carry out the technical transformation of each factory in the next two or three years according to different situations.

(2) The Problem of Developing from Imitation to Self-Design

The initial experience is: we must fully occupy product information at home and abroad; the design process must be connected with reality and the masses; boldly use and train young design forces, rationally use old experts, oppose conservative tendencies, carry out scientific research work, and promote standardization work.

In recent years, the machine industry has greatly improved its manufacturing level by imitating the advanced products of fraternal countries. However, the continuous high growth of the national economy requires the machine industry to develop from imitation to self-design. Many problems have now emerged that cannot be solved by imitation alone. Many machines must be designed according to the country's resources, natural characteristics, and specific conditions of use. For example, the design of large-scale water turbines must be based on the height of the water head and the size of the water volume; the design of agricultural machinery must adapt to the characteristics of China's terrain, soil, climate, and cultivation; the design of transportation equipment and power machinery must be based on the conditions of regions, routes, climate, and power resources. The design of various special-purpose equipment must be based on specific usage purposes. The number of varieties needed is increasing, and it is absolutely impossible to solve all of them by imitation. Moreover, if we do not have the ability to self-design, it will be difficult to plan and arrange the series of product development, so that many places that can be simplified and unified in production cannot be simplified and unified, resulting in unreasonable phenomena in production. In the long run, we need to develop our own design capabilities in order to catch up with the world's advanced level in technology. Therefore, during the second five-year plan period, on the one hand, we must continue to adopt imitation methods to develop a large number of varieties; on the other hand, we must also work hard to cultivate design forces and carry out product design work. In this regard, China's engineering and technical personnel have successfully designed some relatively major products with the help of experts from the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries, and have gained preliminary experience.

The preliminary experience of design work is:

First, we must fully occupy product information at home and abroad. Because any product has its own historical development process. Although design work is a creative work, it cannot be separated from the experience accumulated by predecessors. We must promote the new from the old on the basis of existing achievements. We should pay attention to making the best use of existing structures, combining them with the country's actual conditions and improvement requirements, and fully considering the economic effects in production to synthesize them. In this way, we can design new products with modern levels in the fastest and most economical way.

Second, the design process must be connected with reality and the masses. When designing large freight locomotives, the design staff of Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Plant went to various locomotives to practice, and collected many opinions on improving the structure from drivers and stokers; they also put forward the slogan that design staff should make friends with workers, and often went to the workshop to repeatedly discuss whether the designed structure was suitable for processing with workers; they also sent the design plan to research institutions, schools, and experts from other relevant parties for review. These practices concentrated the wisdom of more people and summarized the practical experience of users, producers, and researchers in many aspects. Therefore, it has made better designs that can better meet the requirements of use and are easy to process and manufacture.

Although we try our best to connect with reality in the design process, it is still something on paper and must be tested by trial production and even operation before we can finally determine its correctness. Therefore, designers must actively participate in trial production and the identification of trial products, and pay attention to the subsequent operation so as to modify the defects in the design and learn from it to improve the design.

Third, we must boldly use and vigorously train young design forces. We lack experienced design personnel, and we can only train them while doing and learning. Many products that need to be designed are relatively new and major products. To design these products, we must boldly use and train young designers under the guidance of experienced experts, encourage and enthusiastically help them, so that they dare to undertake these new and major tasks; those who have achieved success in design should be rewarded, and for mistakes, as long as they are not intentional, we should focus on education and should not criticize too much; we should teach them to accumulate and use data, connect with reality, connect with the masses and other correct design methods; cultivate the ability to think, analyze, and judge independently, and prevent the tendency of copying mechanically or building behind closed doors. At the same time, we should pay attention to the rational use of old experts and the training of designers from staff and workers. Designing and manufacturing new types of products is a key issue in the development of the machine industry. We must strengthen the leadership of design work, oppose conservative tendencies, actively overcome difficulties, and strive to create conditions for carrying out design work, and constantly summarize design experience so that design forces can grow rapidly.

In addition, we should pay attention to combining with the technical forces of the departments that use the machines to design together; and we should attach importance to the important role of technical assistance from the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries.

The design and manufacture of new products must have scientific experimental research work as a foundation. The various levels of experimental research institutions in the machine industry sector must widely contact and cooperate with the Academy of Sciences, universities, and various user departments. In addition to solving the current key design and process problems in production, we must also pay attention to the further development of technology. Design research work should solve the problems of product selection, design calculation basis, structure, performance, and materials; process research work, in addition to participating in the technical transformation of factories, should solve the manufacturing technology of major products, especially the process problems of manufacturing large and precise products; we should study new materials, new technologies, and the mechanization and automation of production processes. In order to grasp the new achievements of world technology in time, we also need to carry out technical intelligence work.

Developing the machine industry towards a complete system and self-design is an important condition for promoting production standardization. There are many types of mechanical products, and there are even more types of parts and materials used in each product. The problem is that we need both variety to meet needs, and simplified design and manufacture to facilitate production. The solution is to promote product serialization and standardization, that is, to classify the various products, parts, raw materials, etc. into series, and then appropriately set unified standards according to their different types, sizes, etc., and stipulate unified manufacturing methods and quality standards. This can greatly simplify design, simplify manufacturing work, and enable the organization of specialized and collaborative production of products and parts. Of course, this is an extremely complex task. We must proceed step by step, distinguishing between urgency and priority: first carry out the standardization and serialization of major products, and the formulation and implementation of basic standards, such as standards for diameter, thread, tolerance fit, etc., to improve the interchangeability of standard parts and mass-produced parts. In sorting out existing products, we should pay attention to maintaining the original excellent varieties and the varieties that are needed by the society and for which there are no better substitutes. We should not blindly eliminate them. Machine industry workers should not regard themselves as key points, they should strictly demand themselves, learn with an open mind, and do their work well.

The success or failure of all work depends entirely on the ideology and work style and the quality of political work. The machine industry is one of the key points of national construction. In the allocation of manpower, material resources, and financial resources, and in the coordination of cooperation, it is often in a priority position. This makes it easy for us to regard ourselves as key points, demand too much from others, and not strictly demand ourselves. Industrial work is a new work, and we are easily prone to use old methods to deal with new problems, or when we learn a little, we think we are great, and we are arrogant and arrogant and disregard others. The task is complicated and it is easy to make us trapped in daily business and not see the political direction clearly. We must be deeply vigilant about these situations. We request party committees at all levels to strengthen the leadership and supervision of machine industry work. We must always remember Comrade Mao Zedong's words: "Modesty helps one to make progress, while conceit makes one lag behind." We must learn with an open mind, rely on the Party and the masses, and do our work well.

    使机械工业向完整体系和自行设计的方向发展
    国家技术委员会主任兼第一机械工业部部长　黄敬同志的发言
    我完全同意中央委员会的三个报告。中央指出，我国社会主义工业化的主要要求，就是要在大约三个五年计划时期内，基本上建成一个完整的工业体系；并且指出，发展机械工业是建成这个完整工业体系的主要环节之一。
    各个经济部门在建设中所需要的机器设备，不仅数量大、种类繁杂，而且随着技术发展也日新月异。例如，建设一个钢铁联合企业，就需要十几万吨、成千上万种的设备；同时还要建设很多和它相配合的企业，如煤矿、电站、交通和城市公用设施等，这些也都需要很多的设备。我们的机械工业原有基础很薄弱。虽然几年来，在苏联及其他兄弟国家的援助下，有了很大的发展，但是规模还小，缺门还多，特别是大型的、精密的、成套的设备，大都还不能制造。这是我国现在机器自给率还很低的根本原因。在上一个世纪马克思就说过：“大工业必须掌握着它的最特别的生产资料，即机器本身；必须用机器制造机器。要这样，它方才有它的适当的技术基础，有它自身的立足点。”由此可见，机械工业必须努力克服它自己的薄弱环节，迅速地发展和壮大起来，使它能够供应国家建设中的主要设备。否则要建立起一个完整的工业体系是不可能的。
    在第二个五年计划任务中，中央提出，要特别注意机械工业和冶金工业的建设，而机械工业的发展，要特别着重大型设备、专用机床、仪表及无线电工业的发展。我们认为这些都是完全正确的。
    我仅就我国机械工业发展中的两个重要问题，即将修配性的工业改造为制造的工业和从仿造向自行设计的方向发展的问题，讲一点意见。
    （一）将修配工业改造为制造工业问题
    从修配转变到制造，必须确定企业的专业生产方向；建立企业的正常生产秩序；建立一套正规的制造方法和制度；对企业进行技术改造。
    中国的机械工业，在近百年来，有了一定程度的发展。已经生长起来了一个不小的技术力量，这个技术力量是以具有几代技术传统的老工人和有经验的技术人员为骨干的。但是在旧中国，机械工业基本上只是一个殖民地、半殖民地的修配性质的工业。除了一部分工厂能作一些普通机器以外，大部分只能做一些零件和部件，或者只能做装配工作，不能制造完整的机器；设备陈旧，而且残缺不全；生产任务杂乱，没有固定的专业，来什么就做什么；只有生产车间，没有工具车间及其他辅助车间；生产不正规：没有正规的产品图纸，没有一定的质量标准，工作单凭工人各自的手艺，也没有什么工艺规程；做出来的零件如果不合适，就锉锉刮刮，敲敲打打，凑合着装配上去。这样的生产，质量当然很差，效率很低，成本很高，而且做不出完整的或成套的产品。所以，我们在原有的工厂进行了民主改革，巩固了新的生产关系之后，首先遇到的问题，就是如何把这个不正规的修配性的机械工业改造成为正规的制造工业。
    开始制造，我们还没有设计产品的能力，因此，必须从仿造入手。我们有苏联和其他兄弟国家给予我们的技术援助：派来了专家，供给新型的设备和产品图纸、技术资料等；有党中央对社会主义建设的全面规划和各级党委的领导；有广大职工在社会主义建设中的积极性，这些优越条件，使得我们能够迅速开始进行新机器的制造。
    从修配转变到制造，我们进行了以下的工作：
    第一、确定企业的专业生产方向。一九五二年，在前中央财政经济委员会直接主持下，对全国的国营机械工厂作了大体的分工。以后，又经过逐年的调整，到现在，大部分国营的工厂都已经有了专业生产方向。这是将修配工厂改变为制造工厂的一个前提。因为把工厂制造什么的问题解决了，生产中的一切技术和组织工作才有根据。这项工作到目前还没有完全做好，有些工厂的专业方向还没有完全确定，或者确定得不恰当，常在变化。过去几年，我们对于各部的、地方的、公私合营的机械工业，安排得尤其不够。在今天全行业公私合营的新情况下，对全国机械工业更需要作进一步的妥善安排。除了要考虑专业化之外，还要注意组织相当的企业，来承担制造零星产品和修理的任务。这是一个很复杂的工作，我们还缺乏细致的研究。
    第二、建立企业的正常的生产秩序。要把成千个零件组成的机器合格地生产出来，而且要充分利用生产能力，达到多、快、好、省，没有良好的生产秩序，是不可能的。为建立生产秩序，我们首先推行了作业计划，把各车间的生产活动组织起来；其次加强生产的准备工作，特别是生产的技术准备工作，使工厂各科的工作能够配合车间的生产；进而明确工厂各级组织的分工。这样，从工厂各科的生产准备开始，一直到成品出厂，整个生产过程就能够合理地组织起来。几年来这项工作虽然有很大成绩，但是，由于目前生产计划还不稳定，生产的供应与协作工作还有缺点，产品的发展规划还没有做好等，都还影响着它进一步的提高。
    第三、建立一套正规的制造方法和制度。开始仿造时，产品质量很坏，甚至有些工厂很长一个时期做不出合格的产品来。这是由于我们还没有掌握一套正规的制造方法和制度的缘故。正规地制造一种新的产品，要有一套技术文件做依据，还要有一套正规制度来保证它的贯彻实行；而且这些文件的制定要通过试制的验证，如图纸是否正确，用什么样的加工方法才恰当，工艺规程是否切合实际等，都要通过试制才能肯定下来。这些道理，我们当时不懂得，没有能够及时地向工厂指出来，这是许多工厂走了弯路，造成生产混乱的主要原因。在大家认识到正规生产的必要以后，在各级党委的领导下，经过职工群众的努力，克服了修配习惯，掌握了正规生产的方法，建立了正规的生产制度以后，情况才改变过来。如上海汽轮机厂，就是经过了这样的过程，才掌握了像汽轮机这样比较复杂而又精密的产品的制造技术。这项工作各厂作的还很不平衡，特别是在强调正规生产和学习国外经验中，我们对总结群众创造的经验，和如何使国外经验和生产的具体条件相结合等方面还注意不够。这些就是这项工作中在目前还急待克服的缺点。
    第四、进行企业的技术改造。企业经过以上各项工作，虽然已经初步建立了生产秩序，技术水平有了提高，可是，它的技术基础还很薄弱。工厂虽然已经初步专业化了，但是设备多半还是万能的、低效率的，缺乏必要的精密加工和专用的机器。机械化的程度很低，手工劳动多。车间布置和设备排列不合理，不适合专业生产的要求。因此，生产中工时和材料都消耗的多，质量也不易保证。
    更突出的问题还在于技术后方薄弱。所谓技术后方，是指进行技术准备和保证生产所必需的辅助车间和工厂的技术机构。设计、工艺工作跟不上车间的要求；工具车间很薄弱，工夹具供应不上；机械修理车间能力不够，设备往往失修，不能保持精度；材料的化验，零件和成品的检验，产品和工艺的试验研究机构等都还很不健全；计量基准还不统一；标准化工作还没有开展等等，这些工作的落后，都限制了生产效率和技术水平的提高。
    针对这些情况，要对企业进行系统的技术改造，包括：补充工具、修理等辅助车间的力量；建立试验、计量、检验等工作；加强各个技术机构；改进工艺与生产组织，特别是要按产品零件的制造和装配过程，组织生产线；修理和改装旧的设备；增添必要的新的和专用的设备；对铸、锻车间及沉重劳动进行适当的机械化等等。要纠正过去“只顾前方，忽视后方”的偏向。
    企业如果经过以上的这些改造，就能够逐步改变技术落后的状况。以沈阳第二机床厂为例，在一九五五年曾经有几个月因为质量太差而停止生产。进行了全面的技术改造以后，工厂的技术水平和组织水平都有很大提高，不但质量改善了，生产能力也比改造前提高了一倍。
    对老厂进行系统的技术改造，我们认识得比较迟，下手较晚，过去对老厂的投资也削减过多，直到去年才开始比较系统地进行这一工作。我们预备在今后两三年内，根据不同的情况，逐步进行各厂的技术改造。
    （二）从仿造向自行设计的方向发展问题
    初步的经验是：必须充分占有国内外的产品资料；设计过程中要联系实际，联系群众；放手使用和培养青年的设计力量，合理使用老专家，反对保守倾向，开展科学研究工作，推行标准化工作。
    几年来，机械工业通过仿造兄弟国家的先进产品，制造水平得到很大提高。但是，国民经济的不断高涨，要求机械工业必须从仿造向自行设计发展。现在已经出现许多问题，光靠仿造是解决不了的。不少机器，必须根据本国资源、自然特点及使用的具体条件等进行设计，如设计大型水轮机，就要根据水头的高低和水量的大小；设计农业机械，要适应我国的地形、土壤、气候、耕作等特点；设计交通运输设备和动力机械，要根据地区、路线、气候、动力资源等条件。设计各种特殊专用设备，必须根据具体使用目的。需要的品种越来越多，也绝不可能全靠仿造来解决。而且，如果自己没有自行设计的本领，就很难有计划地安排产品发展的系列，使生产中许多可以简化和统一的地方，也不能简化、统一，造成生产中的不合理现象。从长远来说，我们在技术上要赶上世界先进水平，更需要发展自己的设计的能力。因此，在第二个五年计划期间，我们一方面仍然要继续采取仿造办法，大量发展品种；另一方面还必须努力培养设计力量，开展产品的设计工作。这方面，我国工程技术人员，在苏联和其他兄弟国家专家的帮助下，已经设计成功一些比较重大的产品，取得了初步的经验。
    设计工作的初步经验是：
    第一、必须充分占有国内外的产品资料。因为任何产品，都有它自己的历史发展过程。设计工作虽然是一种创造性的工作，但是，不能脱离前人积累的经验。必须在已有成就的基础上，推陈出新。要注意尽量利用已有的结构，再结合本国实际和改进的要求，并且充分考虑生产中的经济效果，加以综合。这样，才能最快地最节省地设计出现代化水平的新产品。
    第二、在设计过程中要联系实际，联系群众。大连机车车辆制造厂，在设计大型货运机车的时候，设计人员到各种机车上去见习，向司机、司炉搜集了很多改进结构的意见；他们又提出了设计人员要和工人交朋友的口号，经常下车间和工人反复商量所设计的结构是否适于加工；还把设计方案送给研究机关、学校以及其他有关方面的专家，请他们审查。这些做法，就集中了较多人的智慧，总结了使用者的、生产者的、研究者的多方面的实践经验，因而做出了质量较好的设计，使产品能够更好地适应使用的要求，而且便于加工制造。
    设计过程中，虽然尽量联系实际，但是毕竟还是纸上的东西，必须经过试制以至于运转的考验，才能最后确定它的正确性。因此，设计人员必须积极参加试制和试制品的鉴定工作，并且关心以后的运转情况，以便修改设计中的缺陷，并且从中吸取经验，提高设计。
  第三、要放手使用和大力培养青年的设计力量。我们缺少有经验的设计人员，只有在边做边学中培养。需要设计的产品很多是比较新型和重大的产品。设计这些产品，要在有经验的专家指导下，大胆使用和培养青年设计人员，鼓励并热情地帮助他们，使他们敢于承担这些新的、重大的任务；在设计中有成就的应该奖励，对于过错，只要不是有意的，应该着重教育，不应该过多地责备；要使他们学会积累和运用资料、联系实际、联系群众等正确的设计方法；培养独立思考、分析、判断的能力，防止生搬硬套或闭门造车的偏向。同时，还要注意老专家的合理使用，和从职员和工人中培养设计人员。设计和制造新种类产品，是发展机械工业的一个关键性问题，我们要加强对设计工作的领导，反对缩手缩脚的保守倾向，要积极的克服困难，努力创造条件开展设计工作，并且不断地总结设计经验，使设计力量很快地生长起来。
    此外，还要注意和使用机器的部门的技术力量结合起来，共同设计；而且要重视苏联及其他兄弟国家技术援助的重要作用。
    设计和制造新产品，要有科学实验研究工作作基础。机械工业部门的各级验实研究机构，必须广泛和科学院、高等学校及各使用部门联系合作。除了应该解决当前生产中的设计和工艺关键问题以外，还要注意技术进一步发展的问题。设计研究工作要解决产品的选型、设计计算根据、结构、性能、材料等问题；工艺研究工作，除了要参加工厂的技术改造以外，要解决重大产品的制造技术，特别要研究制造大型和精密产品的工艺问题；要研究新材料，新工艺，以及生产过程的机械化自动化等问题。为了及时掌握世界技术的新成就，还需要开展技术情报的工作。
    机械工业向完整体系和自行设计的方向发展，推行生产标准化是一个重要条件。机械产品的种类很多，每种产品的零件和所使用的材料种类也就更多。问题是既要多种多样以满足需要，又要简化设计和制造以利生产。解决的办法是推行产品的系列化和标准化，就是把多种多样的产品、零件、原材料等分门别类地编排成为系列，再按照它们的不同类型、尺寸等，适当地定出统一的标准，以及规定出统一的制造方法和质量标准，这样就既能大大简化设计，简化制造工作，又能够根据需要按系列发展多种多样的品种。而且使组织产品和零件的生产专业化与协作有了条件。当然，这是个极其复杂的工作。要分别缓急、有步骤地进行：先进行主要产品的标准化和系列化工作，和基本标准的制定与推行工作，如直径、螺纹、公差配合等标准，提高标准件及成批生产的零件的互换性。在整理现有产品中，要注意保持原有的优良的品种和社会上有需要而又没有更好的能够代替它的品种，不应该盲目淘汰。机械工业工作者不要以重点自居，应当严格要求自己，虚心学习，把工作做好。
    一切工作的成败，全都决定于思想作风和政治工作的好坏。机械工业是国家建设的重点之一，在分配人力、物力、财力和解决互相配合协作的时候，常常处在优先的地位。这就很容易使我们以重点自居，过多地要求别人，不严格要求自己。工业工作是一门新的工作，我们很容易用老一套的方法来处理新的问题，或者在学到一点东西的时候，就自以为了不起，而狂妄自大目中无人。工作任务繁杂，又容易使我们陷在日常的业务当中，看不清政治方向。这些情形，我们必须深自警惕。我们请求各级党委加强对于机械工业工作的领导和监督。我们一定要时时记住毛泽东同志的话：“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”。一定要虚心学习，依靠党和群众，把工作做好。
