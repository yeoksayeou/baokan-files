Comrades!
    We, the delegates of the Labour-Progressive Party, on behalf of your friends across the Pacific, the peace-loving people of Canada, salute the Chinese people and their leaders, the Chinese Communist Party, in their construction of a new life.

    We congratulate you on the great success of your Eighth Congress. We are very pleased to attend this congress as your guests. Since arriving in China, we have received the sincere and warm welcome and care of the Chinese people, which we know is also a manifestation of your friendship towards the Canadian people.

    We are paying very close attention to your discussions so that we can tell our party and the Canadian people what work you are doing to build socialist industry and agriculture, and to transform ancient China into a modern industrial country.

    Comrades, your work is rapidly changing the world. Feudal landlordism and imperialist exploitation prevented China from achieving real development for centuries, but under the leadership of your party, China has broken these chains and won national liberation. In the words of Comrade Mao Zedong: The Chinese people have stood up and are no longer an insulted nation.

    Now your great country is advancing towards socialism through the people's democratic dictatorship, with the strength of the proletariat as its steel core.

    We are fully confident that you will overfulfill the first Five-Year Plan, and that in the second and third Five-Year Plans, you will complete the socialist transformation of China. This is a major event in human history.

    The peace camp headed by the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, including the people's democratic countries, now also includes increasingly broad regions, such as India, Indonesia, and Egypt. This peace camp not only guarantees the final defeat of imperialism and colonialism, but also makes the victory of peace and democracy in Western capitalist countries even closer. The great Lenin foresaw this great democratic process very wisely in his last writings.

    In Canada, the government still refuses to diplomatically recognize the People's Government of China, refuses to lift the trade embargo, and refuses to support China's right to a seat in the United Nations. This is a clear violation of the wishes of the Canadian people, because Canada urgently needs to conduct mutually beneficial trade with the Chinese people—our national interests demand this.

    The Communist and Socialist parties in Canada are working to win recognition of your government and to promote trade. Recently, the Canadian Congress of Industrial Unions reiterated this demand. Farmers' organizations have also taken the same position, and a broad section of the banking, industrial, and commercial communities, based on their own interests, also oppose the government's policy, and in this regard, their interests are consistent with those of labor.

    So why does the Canadian government refuse to recognize China and engage in trade? Because it is listening to the orders of Wall Street, not the voices of the Canadian people.

    In our opinion, the Canadian government will soon have to listen to the growing public opinion and change its policy on this issue. That will be a victory for our national democratic cause of defending Canadian independence and abolishing the rule of American imperialism in our country.

    In your long struggle for national liberation, the people of our country have always expressed support for your cause, conducting anti-Japanese aggression and non-interference in China movements, and participating in your struggle for national liberation. The Canadian Communists who are buried in the land of China and the noble Doctor Norman Bethune are not only respected by the Chinese people, but are also a national hero of the Canadian democratic movement. Dr. Bethune symbolizes the sincere feelings of the Canadian people towards the Chinese people.

    We have learned a lot from the work of your Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, from the collective working style of your party, from your use of the weapon of criticism, and from your creative contributions to Marxism-Leninism. Marxism-Leninism is the science of human liberation, which guides the communists of all countries and unites them in a fraternal international family. The paths of various countries towards socialism are different, but the final goal is the same, that is, the people achieve communism under the leadership of the working class and its advanced unit, the Communist Party.

    Your congress is a valuable contribution to strengthening the thinking and practice of all Communist and Workers' Parties. We express our gratitude for these contributions. We will study them very carefully within our party. They will expand our understanding of Marxism-Leninism and strengthen our internationalism.

    May the friendship between the people of China and Canada grow stronger and develop in the common cause of peace, progress, and democracy!

    We sincerely congratulate the Chinese people and their Communist Party for their successful work and new victories!

### 加拿大劳工进步党代表团团长摩里斯同志致词

    加拿大劳工进步党代表团团长摩里斯同志致词同志们！
    我们劳工进步党代表在太平洋彼岸的你们的朋友、加拿大爱好和平的人民，向中国人民和他们在建设新生活中的领导者中国共产党致敬。
    我们祝贺你们的第八次代表大会获得最大的成就。我们很高兴作为你们的来宾出席这次大会。我们在到达中国以后受到了中国人民的真诚的、热烈的欢迎和关怀，我们知道这也是你们对加拿大人民的友谊的表现。
    我们非常仔细地注意着你们的讨论，以便我们将来能够告诉我们的党和加拿大人民，你们正在做些什么工作来建设社会主义的工业和农业，把古老的中国改造为一个现代化的工业国。
    同志们，你们的工作正在迅速地改变着世界。封建地主和帝国主义剥削使中国有好几世纪得不到真正的发展，但是在你们党的领导下，中国已经打破了这锁链，并且赢得了民族解放。用毛泽东同志的话来说：中国人民已经站起来了，不再是一个被侮辱的民族了。
    现在你们的伟大的国家，正在通过以无产阶级的力量为钢铁核心的人民民主专政，向社会主义迈进。
    我们完全相信，你们将超额完成第一个五年计划，而且在第二个和第三个五年计划内，你们将完成中国的社会主义改造。这是人类历史上的一件大事。
    以苏联和中华人民共和国为首的和平阵营，包括各人民民主国家，现在还包括越来越广阔的地区，像印度、印度尼西亚和埃及等国家。这一和平阵营不仅保证最后打败帝国主义殖民主义，而且也使得和平和民主事业在西方资本主义国家的胜利更加临近。伟大的列宁在他最后的著作中非常英明地预见到了这个伟大的民主进程。
    在加拿大，政府至今还拒绝在外交上承认中国的人民政府，拒绝取消贸易禁运，拒绝支持中国在联合国的席位的权利。这是明显地违反加拿大人民的意愿的，因为加拿大迫切需要同中国人民进行互利的贸易——我国的民族利益要求这样做。
    加拿大的共产主义和社会主义政党都在为争取承认你们的政府和进行贸易而努力。最近，加拿大工人统一工会大会重申了这个要求。农民的组织也采取了相同的立场，而且广大的银行界、工业界和商业界人士，从他们自己的利益出发也反对政府的政策，而在这一点上是和劳工的利益一致的。
    那么为什么加拿大政府拒绝承认中国和开展贸易呢？因为它听从的是华尔街的命令，而不是加拿大人民的呼声。
    在我们看来，加拿大政府不久就要不得不听从日益高涨的舆论要求，而改变它在这一问题上的政策。那将是我们保卫加拿大独立和取消美帝国主义在我国的统治的民族民主事业的胜利。
    在你们争取民族解放的长期斗争中，我国人民对你们的事业一直是表示支持的，他们进行了反对日本侵略的不准干涉中国的运动，他们参加你们争取民族解放的斗争。长眠在中国土地上的加拿大共产党人和崇高的医生诺尔曼·白求恩大夫不仅受到中国人民的尊敬，并且是加拿大民主运动的一位民族英雄。白求恩大夫象征着加拿大人民对中国人民的真挚感情。
    我们从你们的中央委员会和毛泽东同志的工作，从你们党的集体工作作风，从你们对批评武器的运用，从你们对马克思列宁主义的创造性的贡献，学到了很多东西。马克思列宁主义是人类获得解放的科学，它指导世界各国共产党人并且把他们团结在一个友爱的国际大家庭中。各国走向社会主义的道路是不同的，但是最后的目标是相同的，那就是人民在工人阶级和它的先进部队共产党的领导下实现共产主义。
    你们的大会对于加强一切共产党和工人党的思想和实践，是宝贵的贡献。我们对这些贡献表示感谢。我们将在我们的党内极为仔细地研究它们，它们将扩大我们对马克思列宁主义的了解，加强我们的国际主义。
    祝中国和加拿大两国人民之间的友谊在和平、进步和民主的共同事业中日益增强和发展！
    我们热诚地祝贺中国人民和他们的共产党工作成功，并取得新的胜利！（附图片）
