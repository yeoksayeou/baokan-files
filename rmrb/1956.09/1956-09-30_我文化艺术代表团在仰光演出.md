Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, 29th: The Chinese Cultural and Artistic Delegation held its premiere in Rangoon on the evening of September 28th, under the auspices of U Nu, Chairman of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League of Burma and former Prime Minister.

The delegation’s performances are at the invitation of U Nu.

The delegation is scheduled to perform three shows here, and all proceeds from the performances will be donated to the Burmese government as a social welfare fund.

Among those who watched the performance were Burmese government ministers, members of parliament, other senior officials, and prominent figures. The theater was filled with more than 2,600 spectators, with approximately 1,000 more watching while standing alongside.

U Nu said in his opening remarks: "These performances will greatly help promote the existing friendly relations between China and Burma. There is a traditional friendship between the peoples of the two countries, which makes frequent exchanges in dance, music, and drama possible. For this reason, the friendly relations between the two countries are being consolidated and developed day by day."

Ma Hanbing, head of the Chinese Cultural and Artistic Delegation, said that cultural exchanges between China and Burma have developed significantly, and we are learning from each other in this cultural exchange. All of this greatly benefits the people of both countries.

    据新华社仰光29日电　中国文化艺术代表团9月28日晚间在缅甸反法西斯人民自由同盟主席、前总理吴努主持下，在仰光举行了首次公演。
