Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 7th: Hong Kong sources report that members of the Hong Kong business community have voiced criticisms of the Hong Kong British authorities' re-implementation of so-called "entry-exit balance" measures.

    Gao Zhuoxiong, Vice-Chairman of the Hong Kong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, said that earlier this year, restrictions on travel between Hong Kong and the mainland were temporarily lifted, which brought a turning point to the Hong Kong market. However, the Hong Kong British authorities suddenly re-imposed restrictions on population entry and exit, which is inconvenient for businessmen to travel for business negotiations, for residents to visit relatives in Hong Kong, and for overseas Chinese to travel abroad via Hong Kong, and it also has an impact on business in the Hong Kong market. He hoped that a solution could be found as soon as possible to avoid damage to business.

    Li Wenqi, Vice-Chairman of the Hong Kong Zhongshan Chamber of Commerce, said that the Hong Kong British authorities have placed an artificial barrier between the mainland and Hong Kong, isolating the normal exchanges between compatriots in the two places. This result will directly affect the smooth flow of related business in Hong Kong. He hoped that the Hong Kong British authorities would fully consider the significant impact of this restriction when implementing it.

    Liang Canhui, Chairman of the Hong Kong North and South Trade Association, said that our North and South Trade Association has extremely close ties with the mainland in terms of business. The two places often need to send business personnel to each other to negotiate business. The implementation of entry restrictions now directly increases the obstacles to the Association's business development.

    Ye Ruolin, Chairman of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Five Trades United Chamber of Commerce, said that the Mid-Autumn Festival and the Double Ninth Festival are approaching, and many family members and relatives of Hong Kong residents are in the mainland and want to come to reunite or sweep tombs. Now they are restricted from coming to Hong Kong, and residents feel very inconvenienced. Free travel should be restored.

    Li Zhigang, a Standing Committee member of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, said in a conversation that as a large commercial port and transportation hub, it is not surprising that Hong Kong's population increases or decreases by tens of thousands in a few months. Moreover, during this period, 300,000 people from Hong Kong went to Guangzhou. Coming and going is normal. The Hong Kong British authorities should lift the restrictions.

    Ma Wenhui, the person in charge of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Residents' General Association, also asked the Hong Kong British authorities to respect the traditional convenience and rights of Chinese people coming and going to Hong Kong for a hundred years and abolish the "entry-exit balance" measures.

    香港工商界指责所谓“出入平衡”措施
    新华社广州7日电　香港消息：香港工商界人士纷纷发表谈话，指责香港英国当局再度实施所谓“出入平衡”的措施。
    香港中华总商会副会长高卓雄说，今年初，香港和内地居民往来曾一度撤销限制，使香港商场有了转机，但是香港英国当局突然又再限制人口出入，这对商人来往接洽商务、居民来港探亲和华侨经港出国都不方便，对香港商场生意也有影响。希望能早日寻求解决，以免商业遭受打击。
    香港中山商会副理事长李文祺说，香港英国当局在内地和香港之间放上了一重人为的障碍，隔绝两地同胞的正常往来，这样的结果将直接影响到香港有关商业的流畅。希望香港英国当局在执行这项限制时，有必要全面考虑它发生的重大影响。
    香港南北行公所理事长梁灿辉说，我们南北行在业务上和内地的关系是极其密切的。两地经常都要互派业务人员往来接洽商务。现在实施了入境限制，就直接增加了本行发展业务的障碍。
    港九五行联合总商会理事长叶若林说，中秋节和重阳节快到了，香港居民不少家人、亲戚在内地要来团聚或扫墓，现在竟被限制来港，居民们都感到很不方便，应该恢复自由往来。
    中华总商会常务会董李志刚在谈话中认为，香港作为一个大商埠和交通孔道，几个月内增减区区几万人不足为奇，何况在这期间香港有三十万人去广州，有来有往是很正常的。香港英国当局应该取消限制。
    港九居民总会的负责人员马文辉也要求香港英国当局尊重百年来中国人来往香港的传统便利和权利，废除“出入平衡”的措施。
