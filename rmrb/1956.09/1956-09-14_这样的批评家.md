Such Critics
    Li Ce
    I used to be a Sichuan Opera enthusiast, but in the past two years, my affection for Sichuan Opera has faded. To be honest, I'm a bit tired of it. Some describe the poverty of the Sichuan Opera repertoire as "Hong Niang never dies, Cui Xiang can't be forgotten, and articles are never finished," and I don't think that's an exaggeration. However, the opera troupes also have unspeakable difficulties; the Sichuan Opera repertoire is very rich, but they are constrained and dare not perform it. There is an opera troupe in Chengdu that can perform more than 300 plays, but only a few are regularly staged. It's not that they are unwilling to let the audience see more and better plays, so where do the concerns come from?
    It is said that there are such critics who proclaim themselves as representatives of the audience's interests, standing on the high ground of the 1950s, and offering a series of "sincere advice" and "suggestions" on the Sichuan Opera repertoire. For example, when performing "Hunting and Fetching Water," some comrades from the cultural and educational departments said that Li San Niang's crying while fetching water is a manifestation of not loving labor, which has a bad influence on the masses; "San Niang Educates Her Son" does not conform to the spirit of labor education. Some comrades from the health department said that Qiao Da Nian cutting flesh to cure illness in "Embroidered Scroll" and Zhao Ju Yao dripping blood to prove chastity in "Four Journeys to Henan" are unscientific. Tragedies cannot be performed because the people live in a happy era; plays with strong legendary elements cannot be performed because they are simply pursuing bizarre scenes; plays with only pleasant aesthetics cannot be performed because such plays lack "positive significance." To put it mildly, they are all "worth considering." As a result, many plays have been banished from the stage and relegated to the cold palace.
    The theater workers also do not specifically analyze the merits of the plays and plots, and take non-performance as the best policy, to avoid trouble. This leads to a "script shortage." Even the plays that are sorted out, because of excessive concerns, fearing dragons and tigers, and then using the framework of "people's nature" and "positive significance," some excellent traditional scripts are also made unrecognizable. Wang Zhaojun's unwillingness to be the emperor's concubine is a sign of not loving wealth and glory; she must be portrayed as "very progressive," and cannot have any bourgeois corrupt and degenerate thoughts. Hua Rong in "Jiangdong Bridge" must show the heroic spirit of a proletarian revolutionary fighter when he dies, in order to be considered "generous in sacrificing oneself for righteousness." Yang Zongbao in "Mu Guiying" cannot have any husband-centered ideas, otherwise, he is not worthy of being a model husband. It is said that these are all positive characters, and there cannot be a speck of dust on their faces. It can be seen how many rules and regulations there are. Is it any wonder that Sichuan Opera troupes cannot stage more and better plays?
    The critics' and theater workers' well-intentioned concern for the audience is welcome. However, we should also trust the masses. As the saying goes, "The eyes of the masses are discerning." As long as the plays do not contain any toxins, there is no harm in giving them a chance to survive, letting them onto the stage, letting the audience see them, and listening to the audience's opinions. When sorting out and adapting those traditional scripts, "hundred schools of thought should contend," and "one voice should not dominate." A play can have several different versions, to see which one is the most popular. This can not only eliminate the current phenomenon of repertoire poverty, but also allow everyone to learn from each other and learn from each other's strengths. It is difficult to wait until the sorting is perfect before allowing it to be staged. In this way, those who do not understand the tradition and characteristics of Sichuan Opera, cannot distinguish between essence and dross, and arbitrarily ruin Sichuan Opera, will also restrain themselves a little.

    这样的批评家
    李策
    我曾是个川剧的爱好者，这两年对川剧的感情越来越淡。老实说，有点看腻了。有人形容川剧演出剧目的贫乏是“打不死的红娘，记不完的翠香，做不尽的文章”，我看并不过火。但，剧团也有说不出来的苦衷，川剧的剧目很丰富，却束手束脚，不敢演出。成都市有家剧团能演三百多个剧目，可是经常上演的剧目只有几个。他们并不是不愿意让观众看到更多更好的戏，那么顾虑从何而来呢？
    据说有这样的批评家，自封为观众利益的代表，站在二十世纪五十年代的时代高峰，对川剧演出的剧目提出一连串的“忠告”和“建议”。如演“打猎汲水”，文教部门有的同志就说，李三娘打水哭哭啼啼，是不爱劳动的表现，对群众的影响不好；“三娘教子”不符合劳动教育的精神。卫生部门的某些同志则说：“绣卷图”的乔大年剜肉疗疾，“四下河南”的赵琚瑶滴血验贞，都是不科学的。悲剧不能演，因为人民生活在幸福时代；传奇性较强的戏不能演，那是单纯追求情景离奇；光有愉快美感的戏也不能演，因为这种戏缺乏“积极意义”。说得客气一点，都“值得考虑”。这样一来，许多剧目就被逐出舞台，打进冷宫了。
    戏剧工作者也不具体分析剧目、剧情的好坏，以不演为上策，省惹麻烦，于是产生“剧本荒”。就是整理出来的剧目，因为顾虑重重，怕龙怕虎，再用“人民性”“积极意义”的框子一套，把一些优良的传统的剧本也弄得面目全非了。王昭君不甘心做皇帝的妃子，是不爱荣华富贵，要刻画得“非常进步”，不能有一点资产阶级腐化堕落的思想；“江东桥”中的花荣临死时一定要表现出无产阶级革命战士的英雄气概，才算是“慷慨成仁”。“穆桂英”中的杨宗保，不能有一点夫权思想，否则，就不配当丈夫模范。据说，这些都是正面人物，脸上不能沾点灰尘。可见清规戒律何其多也。川剧团不能上演更多更好的剧目，还有什么奇怪？
    批评家们和戏剧工作者们对观众善意的关怀，是值得欢迎的。但，也应该相信群众。常言道：“群众的眼睛是雪亮的”。只要剧目没有什么毒素，无妨高抬贵手，给它们开一线生路，让它们走上舞台，叫观众看一看，听听观众的意见。在整理和改编那些传统的剧本的时候，应该允许“百家争鸣”，不要“一家独唱”。一个剧目可以有几种不同的整理本，看那一种最叫座。这样既可以消除目前剧目贫乏的现象，大家也可以互相观摩，截长补短。一定要等整理得十全十美才许上演，事实上是有困难的。这样，那些不了解川剧传统、特点，分不清精华和糟粕，任意糟蹋川剧的人们，也会收敛一点。
