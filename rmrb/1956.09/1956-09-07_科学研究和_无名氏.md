    Scientific Research and "Anonymous"
    The "People's Daily" published a newsletter on July 13th entitled "Important Contributions of Agricultural Science Workers in East China." On July 27th, the news of the successful trial production of a rice transplanter was published.
    Seeing these news and reports is exciting. However, there is a perplexing question: why do these two reports not tell us: who cultivated the long-staple cotton variety? Who successfully trial-produced the rice transplanter?
    Introducing the glorious achievements of scientific research to the people without mentioning the names of the workers, using "Agricultural Science Workers in East China," "they," and "twelve agricultural science research workers" throughout the article instead, is this appropriate? Don't our scientists have their own names?
    Our country respects the achievements of scientific research and also respects the honor of scientific workers, but the above phenomenon is very inconsistent with this. They insist on recording the achievements of scientific workers in a collective account, giving them the title of "anonymous," and allowing the people who the new society should give honor to "hide their names."

### 科学研究和“无名氏”

    科学研究和“无名氏”
    “人民日报”7月13日刊载了一篇“华东农业科学工作者的重要贡献”的通讯。7月27日发表了水稻插秧机试制成功的消息。
    看到这些消息和报道是令人兴奋的。可是，有一个教人不能理解的问题，这两篇报道为什么没有告诉我们：谁培养了长绒棉品种？谁试制成功了水稻插秧机？
    向人们介绍科学研究的荣誉的成果，一字不提工作者的姓名，通篇用“华东农业科学工作者”，“他们”和“十二位农业科学研究工作者”来代替，这难道是妥当的吗？难道我们的科学家没有他们自己的名字吗？
    我们的国家尊重科学研究的成果，也尊敬科学工作者的荣誉，但是上述这种现象却与此很不相称。他们硬把科学工作者的成果记一笔笼统账，给一个“无名氏”的头衔，让新社会应该给以荣誉的人“隐姓埋名”了。　　高里
