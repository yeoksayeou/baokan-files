    Don't Forget to Store Water and Prevent Drought
    In most areas of Hubei Province, the early rice has already been harvested, and the middle rice is turning yellow. Leaders in some areas are only concerned with the harvest and have forgotten to store water and prevent drought, neglecting the management and maintenance of irrigation projects. In Yingcheng County, a section of the Cejia Dayan Reservoir, which benefits thousands of mu, has been damaged, causing a lot of water leakage. Local leaders believe that "water leakage can still ensure a good harvest" and are not organizing repairs. The energy dissipation pool of the large-scale Silong River Reservoir has also been damaged, and no one is taking care of it. In Huangpi County, the Sifang Pond and Xi'ao Pond of the Wuyi Agricultural Cooperative in Ta'er Township have lost a lot of water, and this has not yet been noticed. This phenomenon also exists in other areas.
    Based on the current situation, some areas will have no problem with water needs for autumn crops; however, we cannot ignore water storage and conservation because autumn droughts often occur here. If there is another autumn drought this year, many fields will lack water for winter planting. People will remember that last winter, some areas mobilized all their labor, organized dozens or even hundreds of waterwheels, and crossed mountains to plant crops. We should learn from last year's lesson. Ge Mu

    不要忘了蓄水防旱
    湖北省大部地区早稻已经收割，中稻正在勾头黄熟。有些地区的领导干部只顾丰收而忘了蓄水防旱，放松了灌溉工程的管理养护。应城县受益千亩以上的测家大堰水库剅门坏了一块，蓄水流漏很多，当地领导干部却认为“水漏了也可保收”，不去组织整修。大型工程四龙河水库的消力池冲坏了也没人去管它。黄陂县塔耳乡五一农业社的四方塘和细凹塘的水放走了很多，还没有被发觉。这种现象在别的地区也有。
    根据现在的情况来看，有些地区秋季作物的需水是没有问题的；但是不能因此而忽视蓄水保水；因为这里时常发生秋旱。如果今年再有秋旱，不少田地的冬播用水就会感到缺乏。人们还会记得，去冬有些地区动员了全部劳力、组织了几十甚至上百部水车，翻山越岭，才种上了庄稼。去年的这个教训，我们应该很好地记取。　戈木
