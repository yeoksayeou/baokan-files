    Gloriously Completing the Honorable Task of Military Work – Speech by Comrade Peng Dehuai
    I fully agree with Comrade Shaoqi's political report, Comrade Enlai's report on the proposal for the Second Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy, and Comrade Xiaoping's report on the revision of the Party Constitution. Now, on behalf of the Party Military Commission, I will make a brief speech on military work.
    (I) The Heroic Struggle of the Chinese People's Liberation Army
    The path taken by the Chinese People's Liberation Army is a long and tortuous one, from nothing to something, from small to large, passing through repeated victories and defeats before finally reaching victory.
    After the founding of the Chinese Communist Party, it actively promoted and facilitated the cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and led and participated in the Great Revolution of China from 1924 to 1927. When the revolutionary forces extended into the Yangtze River basin and the worker-peasant movement greatly developed, the Kuomintang reactionaries, representing imperialism and feudal forces, immediately exposed their counter-revolutionary features and launched counter-revolutionary coups in the spring and summer of 1927, attacking the revolutionary forces of the time with unprecedented white terror, and tens of thousands of Communist Party members and revolutionary masses were massacred. However, the Communist Party and the revolutionary people were not subdued, but instead aroused great indignation, and they responded to the reactionaries' white terror with armed uprisings. The most famous of these were the Nanchang Uprising, the Autumn Harvest Uprising, and the Guangzhou Uprising, and in these uprisings, the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army was established.
    In October 1927, part of the Autumn Harvest Uprising troops, under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, first entered the Jinggangshan area on the border of Hunan and Jiangxi, and then part of the Nanchang Uprising troops, under the leadership of Comrade Zhu De, arrived in Jinggangshan and joined forces to establish the Jinggangshan-centered revolutionary base area in the Hunan-Jiangxi border region. Raising the red flag of the sickle and hammer and shouting the slogan of "hitting local tyrants and distributing land," they pointed out a correct path of struggle to the people of the whole country and formed the center of the national revolution at that time. Under the influence of this center, people in many provinces and regions, under the leadership of the Communist Party, established Red Army guerrilla units and revolutionary base areas to carry out land revolution. After several years of fierce anti-“encirclement” struggles, the Red Army guerrilla units in various regions eliminated a large number of Kuomintang troops and landlord armed forces, grew to 300,000 men, and established revolutionary base areas with a population of over ten million. However, from 1931, when the Party was ruled by Wang Ming and Bogu's dogmatic errors, serious "left" leaning opportunist errors were committed in both the political and military lines, resulting in the almost complete loss of the revolutionary base areas that had been painstakingly established with blood for many years, and the almost complete annihilation of the people's army. The Zunyi Conference, of great historical significance, corrected the "left" leaning erroneous leadership and established Comrade Mao Zedong's leadership position in the Central Committee, which reversed this dangerous situation, and the basic combat backbone of the Red Army was preserved. During this period, our Party and our army received great training and accumulated rich experience in political and military struggles, enabling the entire Party and army to basically recognize a correct political and military line, thereby preparing extremely favorable conditions for the War of Resistance Against Japan.
    In 1931, after the Japanese imperialists occupied Northeast China, they continued to invade North China, and by July 7, 1937, they launched a large-scale military offensive against our country. Our Party re-cooperated with the Kuomintang, and the Red Army was reorganized into the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army to carry out the great War of Resistance Against Japan. According to the program and policy decided by the Party Central Committee's Luochuan Conference, our army went to the front lines of North and Central China, launched guerrilla warfare against the enemy, established anti-Japanese base areas and three-thirds system of political power, organized the people's anti-Japanese struggle, helped the people reduce rent and interest, and provide disaster relief, and used the gaps between battles to carry out production to reduce the burden on the people. During the eight years of the War of Resistance, our army, under the severe circumstances of repeated "mopping-up" operations by the Japanese invaders, the implementation of the three-all policy (kill all, burn all, loot all), and the encirclement and suppression by the Kuomintang diehards, always persisted in the anti-Japanese guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines, resisted more than 60 percent of the invading Japanese troops and more than 90 percent of the puppet troops, and became the main force in the War of Resistance Against Japan. By the end of the War of Resistance Against Japan, our army had grown to 1.3 million men, and the population of the anti-Japanese base areas was 160 million, creating an unprecedentedly powerful revolutionary force in Chinese history.
    After the end of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Chinese people, who had suffered greatly from the war, urgently demanded peace and democratic reform. Our Party, representing this demand of the Chinese people, conducted negotiations with the Kuomintang, hoping to achieve China's democratic reform through peaceful means. The Kuomintang reactionaries began to pretend to be peaceful and negotiate with us, attempting to use this to paralyze the people, buy time, gather troops, and eliminate our army; after the troops were gathered, they tore off the mask of peace and, with the support of American imperialism, launched a large-scale offensive against the liberated areas with superior forces more than three times greater than our army, forcing the people to accept war once again. Because our Party Central Committee, while exploring peaceful democratic reform, wisely and timely warned us not to relax our vigilance and not to lay down our weapons, the people and army in the liberated areas were able to calmly rise up and fight back when the Kuomintang counter-revolutionary army launched a full-scale offensive against the liberated areas. Under the guidance of Comrade Mao Zedong's Ten Great Military Principles and with the support of the people of the whole country, our army, after three and a half years of fierce battles, eliminated more than 8 million enemy troops, liberated all the territory except Taiwan Province and a few islands, and won a complete victory in the war.
    After the nationwide victory, in order to protect democratic reforms and support economic recovery, our army cleared out Kuomintang secret agents and bandit armed forces throughout the country, and rapidly carried out large-scale demobilization and transfer to civilian work, participating in various national construction projects.
    It is also necessary to specifically mention that just as the Chinese people were concentrating their efforts on peaceful construction and our army was carrying out large-scale demobilization and transfer to civilian work, the Korean War broke out. American imperialism openly announced the occupation of our country's territory of Taiwan, and blatantly disregarded the serious warnings of our people, usurped the name of the United Nations, gathered the invasion armies of sixteen countries, crossed the 38th parallel in Korea, approached the Yalu River, bombed our Northeast, and directly threatened our country's security. Under these circumstances, in order to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and protect our homes and defend our country, the Chinese people were forced to organize the Chinese People's Volunteers to, together with the Korean People's Army, resist the invasion armies' offensive, and with the support and encouragement of the Chinese and Korean people and international peace forces, after nearly three years of war, drove the invasion armies back to the 38th parallel, forcing them to cease fire with the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers. Thus, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the security of our Northeast were defended; it proved that the number one imperialist army in the world could be defeated; it demonstrated the great strength of the Chinese people, enhanced the national self-confidence of our people, and encouraged the struggle of the people of the whole world to fight for peace and against war.
    As mentioned above, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, from the day of its birth, has faced powerful enemies at home and abroad. However, no matter how powerful the enemies were and how superior their conditions were, the Chinese revolutionary war finally ended with the victory of our army and the defeat of the enemies.
    Why was our army able to survive, develop, and grow in the long and severe wars, under extremely difficult conditions? Why was it able to defeat powerful enemies at home and abroad and achieve victory in the revolutionary war?
      The reason why the Chinese People's Liberation Army was able to win is because it had the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. Considering that China was a semi-colonial and semi-feudal country, long under the cruel oppression and exploitation of imperialism and feudal forces, the living conditions of the Chinese people, especially the workers and peasants, were extremely poor, and the demands for national independence and democratic reform were extremely urgent, our Party put forward the revolutionary program of anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism. Considering that the counter-revolutionary forces at home and abroad possessed strong armed forces as the main means of ruling the people and suppressing the revolution, and the lesson of Chen Duxiu's right-leaning opportunism abandoning armed struggle and suffering defeat, our Party determined that armed struggle was the main form of struggle in the Chinese revolution. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "In China, without armed struggle, there would be no status for the proletariat and the Communist Party, and no revolutionary task could be accomplished." Considering that the counter-revolutionary forces in the cities were strong and the revolutionary forces were difficult to survive and develop, and that the vast rural areas were relatively weakly controlled by the counter-revolution, our Party determined the policy of first implementing armed rural separatism, encircling the cities from the countryside, and then seizing the cities. This made our army clear about the direction of struggle and the path to be taken.
    The Party Central Committee also formulated correct political and military lines according to the actual situation of each period. All of these are concentrated in the resolutions and instructions of the Party Central Committee and the works of Comrade Mao Zedong. Based on the scientific theory of Marxism-Leninism and the specific practice of the Chinese revolution, Comrade Mao Zedong made detailed and brilliant expositions on the Chinese revolution, the Chinese revolutionary war, and the problems of our army building. These works have always been the guide to action and combat program for our army's revolutionary war. History proves that whenever the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong was implemented, the revolutionary war achieved victory; conversely, it resulted in serious defeat. The serious losses brought to our army by the "left" leaning opportunism from 1931 to 1934, as well as the losses brought to our army by Zhang Guotao's escapeism and splittism line and the Southern Anhui Incident later, are all painful historical lessons.
    It is obvious that a revolutionary army must have the correct leadership of the Party and the entire army must unite and resolutely obey the correct leadership of the Party in order to achieve victory and avoid defeat. Otherwise, it is impossible to achieve victory.
    The reason why the Chinese People's Liberation Army was able to win is because it had the support and assistance of the broad masses of the people. Our army's interests and demands are completely consistent with those of the people, and its relationship with the people is as close as fish and water. From their own experience, the broad masses of the people realized that the purpose of our army's fighting was not for anything else, but for the liberation and happiness of the people. The people linked their own destiny with the destiny of our army and affectionately regarded our army as their own "sons and daughters."
    Because of this, the people became the source of troop replenishment for the army. During the war, after sufficient mass work, the people automatically and enthusiastically joined our army.
    Because of this, the people automatically became the suppliers of military supplies and provisions for our army. Every family became our army's factory, warehouse, and hospital, ensuring everything our army needed for clothing, food, housing, and transportation.
    Because of this, the people, under the leadership of our Party, voluntarily formed self-defense forces and militias to cooperate with our army in combat, launch attacks and bombing campaigns, clear out spies, scout enemy situations, transport wounded soldiers and ammunition, and act as guides, giving our army various favorable conditions for combat.
    The reason why the Chinese People's Liberation Army was able to win is because it is the people's army. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "They are not combined and fighting for the private interests of a few or a narrow group, but for the interests of the broad masses of the people and for the interests of the entire nation. Standing closely with the Chinese people and serving the Chinese people wholeheartedly is the sole purpose of this army." Although our army's designation, tasks, and combat targets have changed many times in history, the nature of the people's army and the purpose of serving the people have never been changed or shaken at any time.
    Because our army is the people's army, all members have a high degree of consciousness and enthusiasm, understand for whom they are fighting and why they are fighting, and have noble revolutionary ideals and clear directions of struggle. Therefore, in combat, they can heroically and stubbornly attack the enemy, not only have the courage to advance bravely, but also give full play to their high degree of intelligence, and research many combat methods suitable for the situation. The tunnel warfare in the War of Resistance Against Japan, the blasting warfare in the War of Liberation, and the tunnel warfare in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea were all created by the broad masses of officers and soldiers. Therefore, they all have a high sense of political responsibility. In fierce battles, when officers are killed or wounded, lower-ranking officers and soldiers automatically take over and conduct command. Sometimes, even if only a few people or even one person is left, they still independently persist in the battle and never abandon their combat responsibilities because of the dangerous situation.
    Because our army is the people's army, there is no infighting, no struggle for power and profit, no distinction between this part of the army and that part of the army, no distinction between old troops and new troops, and no distinction between officers and soldiers. They are all united under the goal of serving the people, working together and supporting each other to complete common tasks.
    Because our army is the people's army, it can always consider the interests of the people, care about the suffering of the people; help the people with labor and production as much as possible, help the people overcome difficulties; respect the people's customs and habits, and not infringe upon the people's interests. Therefore, wherever our army goes, it can form a blood-and-flesh connection with the people and fight together for the cause of the people's liberation.
    Because our army is the people's army, it has the spirit to overcome all difficulties. Our army has long fought against superior enemies, with inferior equipment, ammunition shortages, food and clothing shortages, and a severe shortage of medicine, with no salary and no proper rest. The hardships of the Long March were even rare and unheard of. All these difficulties did not overwhelm us. We always overcame the difficulties and achieved victory.
    In summary, resolutely obeying the Party's correct leadership over the army, maintaining close ties with the masses of the people, and forever maintaining the nature of the people's revolutionary army are the fundamental guarantees for our army's victory. Therefore, no comrade in our army has any reason to be proud or complacent. We must diligently and conscientiously overcome shortcomings and strive for progress on the basis of past victories in order to complete our army's historical tasks in the great socialist period.
    (II) Army Tasks and Construction Guidelines
    The founding of the People's Republic of China began a new period of socialist construction and socialist transformation in our country. The task of our army in this new period is to defend the socialist construction of the motherland, defend the country's sovereignty, territorial integrity, and security, be ready to liberate Taiwan at any time, and consolidate domestic peace and order. Although the current international situation is trending towards relaxation, the U.S. imperialist aggressive bloc has not abandoned its military aggression plans, adheres to its policy of hostility towards the people of our country, occupies our country's territory of Taiwan, organizes military aggression blocs near our country, establishes military aggression bases, and is strengthening these bases with new-style weapons. Therefore, defending against imperialist aggression and safeguarding the security of our country's construction has become our army's most important task in the future.
    After the liberation of the mainland, our Party Central Committee and our government clearly pointed out that the Chinese People's Liberation Army should be built into an excellent, modern, revolutionary army on its original basis. The purpose of building such an army is to defend against imperialist aggression and safeguard our country's security. There is no other purpose. Only the American warmongers, in order to cover up their evil purpose of preparing to launch a war of aggression, in order to scare certain countries into pulling chestnuts out of the fire for them, and to further enslave these countries, deliberately portray our army's construction as a threat to other countries. However, rumors cannot cover up the facts. In recent years, the people and leaders of many countries, in their exchanges with our country, have gradually understood the sincere desire of our government and people for peace, seen through the conspiracies of the American warmongers, and therefore, the number of countries willing to coexist peacefully with our country has been increasing day by day. We have never thought of, and will never think of, carrying out aggression against other countries. Because our country is a socialist country led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance, any act of aggression is at any time incompatible with the nature of our country. The socialist nature of our country is the fundamental starting point for determining our peaceful foreign policy, and also the fundamental starting point for determining our army's adoption of a strategic defense policy. We will never invade others, but we will never allow others to invade us either. If the aggressive bloc disregards everything and launches a war of aggression against our country, our military and civilians will inevitably rise up to resist and give the aggressors a resolute blow until they are finally eliminated.
    In the past seven years, we have carried out tremendous work in national defense construction in accordance with the Central Committee's policy.
    According to the needs of the actual situation, 31 divisions and 8 regiments of our army have been collectively transferred to production and construction, and the number of cadres transferred to civilian work and soldiers demobilized has reached 5 million. At present, the total number of our army, including newly recruited soldiers, has been reduced by more than 2.7 million compared with the highest number at the time of the national liberation. Military expenditures have decreased from 48 percent of the total national expenditures in 1951 to 19.98 percent in 1956. We fully agree with the Soviet Union's proposal for international disarmament. As long as an agreement can be reached on this issue, we are still willing to further reduce our army.
    In the past, our army was basically composed of single infantry. Now, on the basis of infantry, we have formed the air force, navy, air defense force, public security force, as well as artillery, armored forces, engineering corps, railway corps, communications corps, and chemical defense corps, and built an army composed of various services and arms, completing a major transformation in our army's history. Infantry has played a very important role in our army's war history and is the basic service of our army. It still maintains the largest proportion in the entire army, and the equipment has undergone basic changes. Artillery and tank forces have been greatly strengthened. The technical equipment of other services and arms has also been greatly improved. The air force and air defense force are important services in modern warfare. Although China's air force is not comparable to the largest air force countries, it is not a very weak air force country either. The air defense force has been built and has fairly new-style technical equipment. The construction of the navy has also been correspondingly developed. Although the modernization of our army has not been long, and the various services and arms have not yet reached a completely modernized level, it has reached an unprecedented scale in our country. With the rapid development of national economic construction, the modernization level of our army will be further improved. Here, I would like to express my gratitude to our great ally, the Soviet Union, because the Soviet Union has made brotherly efforts in supplying military equipment and helping us build our national defense industry.
    While improving the army's technical equipment, the entire army has launched regular training to improve command capabilities and technical operations, and to improve political awareness and scientific and cultural levels. Because after the army has modernized equipment and organizational structure, if there are no strong commanding cadres and skilled technicians, all good equipment will not be able to fully play its role. Therefore, in recent years, officer training and troop training have been the center of our army's regular work. Up to now, the entire army has established various colleges and schools, enabling a large number of cadres who have been tempered by war to receive further education, and their knowledge of the laws of modern warfare and technical knowledge has been greatly improved. The quality of troop training has improved significantly and has shown great results in performing tasks and exercises.
    A regularized military system is an important condition for a modernized army. Especially since our army was in a decentralized environment for a long time, and the military systems of various troops were not completely unified, emphasizing the construction of regularization is of great significance in modernization construction. So-called regularization means unified command, unified organization, unified system, unified training, and unified discipline. At present, the entire army has corresponding regulations, rules, and provisions in this regard, and significant achievements have been made in troop training, work, and life order.
    In order to ensure the implementation of our army's strategic defense policy and resist possible sudden attacks by imperialism, in recent years our army has carried out the construction of modern national defense projects on the national defense front lines and in strategic key points in the depth. If the imperialist aggressive bloc does not abandon its aggression plans for a single day, our national defense projects must be continuously strengthened and improved. We firmly believe that the combination of this national defense project and the people's army that has mastered modern weapons will make it impossible for any enemy to achieve their imagined goals of launching an aggression against our country.
    The battlefield of modern warfare is vast, and the manpower and material resources required are enormous. In order to effectively defend against possible sudden attacks by imperialism, we must seriously solve the combination of standing army and reserve personnel, and the combination of the national economy in peacetime and wartime. In terms of manpower, in addition to the standing army, we must accumulate a strong reserve of reserve officers and soldiers as a reserve. Our country's change from a voluntary military service system to a compulsory military service system, and the start of registration and training of reserve officers and soldiers, and the gradual increase of military training courses in colleges and universities, are for this purpose. In terms of material resources, a certain amount of weapons and materials must be stored as needed in the early stages of the war. The large amount of equipment and materials needed throughout the war must rely on the rapid transition of the national economy from peacetime production to wartime production, and must rely on the necessary military production equipment and technical force stored in the civilian production sector in peacetime. Only by making full preparations in the national economic plan in peacetime can we concentrate financial, material, and human resources on economic construction before the war, and once the war breaks out, we can quickly exert the greatest wartime production capacity to support the national army in combat with a steady stream of materials and ensure victory in the war.
    In short, the people of our country need a long-term peaceful environment for socialist construction, and also need a modern revolutionary army to cope with possible sudden incidents and defend socialist construction. Our responsibility lies in properly unifying these two aspects. Therefore, we must not only focus on the modernization construction of the army, but also adapt to the requirements of national economic construction in the construction of the army, save as much as possible, oppose waste, and all military measures must take care of the people's production interests and living interests, maintain our army's close ties with the people, and carry forward the people's revolutionary army's style of diligence and thrift and hard work and simplicity. In recent years, our army building work has made many achievements. However, due to insufficient experience and insufficient research on the situation, serious shortcomings have also occurred in the work. For example, in the early stage of army reorganization, there was a bias towards demanding excessive and excessive improvements in technical equipment; in the process of army regularization, in the construction of national defense projects, phenomena affecting the unity of officers and soldiers and the unity of the army and the people occurred; in learning the experience of modern army building, some inappropriate training methods and working methods were adopted without taking good care of the specific situation. Some of these shortcomings have been corrected and should be avoided from being repeated, and some have not been corrected and need to be overcome. It is hoped that the local Party committees will regularly give leadership and supervision to the work of the army.
  (III) Several Systems That Must Be Adhered To In Army Building
    In order to complete the task of modernization construction of our army, according to our experience and the actual situation of the troops, the following systems must be adhered to.
      1. The Army's Leadership Work System
      The fundamental system of leadership work of the Chinese People's Liberation Army is the system of division of responsibilities by the chief under the collective leadership of the Party committee. This is a long-term and effective leadership system of our army.
    The committees of the Communist Party at all levels in the army are established in accordance with the Party's democratic centralism. It follows the principles of Marxism-Leninism and implements the Party's collective leadership over the work of the troops. All major issues in the troops, such as important instructions and orders from higher levels, plans and arrangements for military, political, and logistics work, cadre deployment, etc., except in emergency situations where the chief of the troops can handle them decisively according to their authority, should be convened by the Party committee meetings for democratic discussion, concentrating everyone's wisdom to make clear decisions, and then handed over to the military and political chiefs of the troops to be responsible for organizing and implementing them.
    In our army, both the military commander and the political commissar are the chiefs of the troops and are jointly responsible for leading the work of the troops. At the same time, there is a division of labor between them. Regarding orders and instructions from higher levels and decisions of the same-level Party committee, the military commander is responsible for organizing and implementing those related to military work, and the political commissar is responsible for organizing and implementing those related to political work.
    It is necessary to implement the collective leadership of the Party committee in the army, because only in this way can we better ensure the Party's leadership over the army, ensure the implementation of the Party's policies and the country's laws and decrees, and prevent the tendency of purely military viewpoints and individualism among leading cadres. Only in this way can we give play to collective wisdom, make up for the lack of individual abilities, prevent the subjective one-sidedness of individuals in viewing problems, and put all aspects of the army's work, especially combat operations, on a more secure basis after careful consideration. Only in this way can the heads of departments understand the overall situation, unify their understanding, and better ensure the centralized command, unified action, and flexible and correct handling of problems in accordance with the actual situation.
    In order to improve the collective leadership of the Party committee, we must implement the working method of democratic style and mass line in our work, strengthen close ties with the broad masses of cadres and soldiers, regularly go deep into the lower levels to check work, sum up and promote the advanced experience of the masses, and correct the shortcomings and errors in our work by means of criticism and self-criticism, so as to prevent the leading comrades of the Party committee from committing errors of bureaucracy and simple commandism due to being divorced from the masses and divorced from reality. After the Party committee makes a decision on the work, it should let go and hand it over to the heads of the troops to do it, in order to give play to the initiative and creativity of the heads of the troops in personal responsibility. It is wrong for the Party committee to interfere with daily business work and take care of everything.
    It is necessary to implement the system of division of responsibilities by the chief in the army, because our army is a revolutionary armed organization that performs combat missions. If there is no resolute and responsible attitude and strong and timely command from the chief, complex combined arms troops will cause confusion in action in emergency combat situations, and even lead to unfavorable combat; in work, it will also create a phenomenon of delay and no one being responsible. Therefore, the chiefs at all levels must, under the collective leadership of the Party committee, actively and proactively perform their duties in accordance with the division of labor. It is also wrong to think that the collective leadership of the Party committee can reduce the responsibility of the chief.
    The leadership system that combines the collective leadership of the Party committee and the division of responsibilities by the chief has formed a relatively complete leadership system in our army's long-term practice. As long as we can have a comprehensive understanding of this system and correctly apply both the collective leadership and the division of responsibilities in the implementation, without giving undue emphasis to one aspect and neglecting the other, then it will not only not weaken the army's centralization and unity, but will also more powerfully guarantee the army's centralization and unity; it will not only not affect the army's mobility in emergency situations, but will also better guarantee correct mobility. After the modernization of the army, the arms are complex, and it is even more necessary to give play to the good role of this leadership system, rather than weakening it.
      2. The Army's Political Work System
    From the time the Chinese People's Liberation Army was created, the Chinese Communist Party established a political work system in the army. In the long-term war test, relying on the correct leadership of the Party, relying on the efforts of political workers and all comrades in the army, our army's political work has accumulated rich experience and has made great contributions to consolidating internal unity, improving combat effectiveness, mobilizing the broad masses of the people to support and participate in the revolutionary war, disintegrating and winning over the enemy army, and thus guaranteeing victory in the war. Political work has become the lifeline of our army.
    Army political work, in essence, is the Party's work in the army, and the political organs are the Party's work organs. The Party, through the political organs, leads the political and ideological education work of the entire army, establishes the patriotism and communist ideology of all soldiers, overcomes various erroneous ideas and work styles; leads the troops to implement the political line of the Party Central Committee and the laws and decrees of the government; leads the Party's organizations, the Communist Youth League organizations, and the broad masses of officers and soldiers to consciously and resolutely implement the orders and instructions of higher levels and complete various tasks in the army.
    Political work must serve the army's combat and work. The task of army political work can only be stipulated according to the army's basic tasks and various specific tasks. Our army's basic task in the past was to realize the victory of the national democratic revolution. In the future, it will be to defend against imperialist aggression and protect the socialist construction of the motherland. Our army's specific tasks, in addition to combat, are army building centered on training, combat readiness, and various regular work in peacetime. The current specific task of our army's political work is to conduct full political and ideological education for the troops, enlighten the troops' political consciousness, further consolidate the unity within the army and the unity between the army and the people, give play to the work initiative and creativity of all revolutionary soldiers, improve the troops' combat effectiveness, and maintain a high degree of vigilance against possible sudden attacks by imperialism, so as to truly guarantee the implementation of our army's basic tasks and various specific tasks in the future.
    In order to correctly play the role of political work, in our army, there should be no tendency to underestimate or weaken the leading position of political work, and we must also prevent the tendency to inappropriately emphasize the special position and special power of political work. Political work must take the initiative to maintain a harmonious and coordinated relationship with military work, and must be good at organizing all soldiers to participate in political work. Only in this way can political work fully play its role and complete its tasks.
    In the new historical conditions, in addition to continuing to adhere to and carry forward the mass line and democratic style, the style of going deep into reality and contacting the masses, and the style of criticism and self-criticism, our army's political work must also go deep into various military activities in order to adapt to the characteristics of army modernization, concretely understand the business and technical situation of the units, humbly learn the business and technical knowledge necessary for its work, prevent the tendency of subjectivism divorced from reality, and make the army's political work develop vigorously in the new situation.
        3. The Army's Democratic System
      The Chinese People's Liberation Army is an army with strong revolutionary discipline, and it is also an army with a high degree of democratic life. From the beginning of its creation, our army thoroughly destroyed the autocratic system of the warlord army and adopted extensive democratic measures. In the long-term struggle after the Gutian Conference in 1929, it gradually formed a democratic system under centralized leadership. This system is closely linked and inseparable from the Party committee's collective leadership system and the political work system. Without a democratic system, the Party committee's collective leadership and political work will become a formality; without the guarantee of the Party committee's collective leadership and political work, there can be no true democracy under centralized leadership.
    The reason why our army can implement democracy is because our army is a tool for the people to liberate themselves. The fundamental interests of our army's superiors and subordinates, officers and soldiers, and between the army and the people are consistent, the goals of struggle are consistent, and there are no antagonistic class contradictions or private conflicts of interest.
    The reason why our army must implement democracy is because the cause our army is engaged in is the great cause of liberating 600 million people, and the task our army is carrying out is the arduous task of destroying the counter-revolutionary armed forces by war. To complete this great cause is by no means possible with the wisdom of a few people, and we must rely on the high degree of initiative and creativity of all members of the army for the revolutionary cause. To achieve this goal, we must implement a democratic system under centralized leadership. This was the case in the past, and it must be the case in the future.
    In our army, democracy is multifaceted, not only in the Party organization and the Communist Youth League organizational life, but also in daily work and combat. All major tasks, as long as conditions permit, after being decided by the Party committee through collective discussion, will be handed over to the lower-level officers and soldiers for discussion using democratic and mass line methods, and their reasonable suggestions will be adopted. In combat, as long as conditions permit, the combat mission, the conditions and methods for achieving victory will be told to all officers and soldiers, and they will be mobilized to carry out extensive and in-depth discussions, so that the leader's plans and determination become the plans and determination of the masses. After the battle is over, a democratic evaluation will be held to summarize the combat experience and evaluate the merits or demerits of each officer and soldier, so that all officers and soldiers will receive a deep and practical training. In daily work, we have various conference lives, through which we study and summarize the work, commend advanced experience, and criticize shortcomings and errors. In order to do a good job, not only do superiors criticize subordinates, but subordinates can also criticize superiors, and soldiers can also criticize officers. Officers must humbly listen to the opinions of lower-level officers and soldiers and accept correct criticism. There must be no suppression of criticism or attacks on critics. Inappropriate criticisms and opinions can only be explained. Experience has proved that implementing such democracy does not damage the prestige of cadres. On the contrary, the prestige formed by democratic leadership is the truly testable prestige. The maintenance of our army's discipline is also mainly based on democratic methods, not simply relying on superiors to restrain and supervise subordinates, but using the method of mass self-criticism education to improve political awareness, self-restraint, and everyone's restraint. This kind of conscious discipline can be maintained with the supervision of superiors, and it can also be maintained without the supervision of superiors. It can be maintained in peacetime, and it can also be maintained in wartime in the most complex and difficult situations.
    In the past, some comrades in our army did not pay attention to promoting democracy, and we have conducted serious criticism and struggle against this. Now, because our army is carrying out modernization and regularization construction, some comrades have doubts about the democratic system, thinking that modern warfare requires a high degree of centralization in command, and there is no need to emphasize democracy. This understanding is wrong. They do not understand that our army's modernization and regularization have not changed the nature of the people's army, and the true high degree of centralization can only be established on the basis of a high degree of democracy. The centralization established solely by compulsory means is only a false and untested centralization. Therefore, in our modernization and regularization construction, we must oppose the tendency to weaken democracy, and we must further strengthen democracy and promote democracy.

    胜利完成军事工作的光荣任务
    彭德怀同志的发言
    我完全同意少奇同志的政治报告、恩来同志的发展国民经济的第二个五年计划建议的报告和小平同志的修改党章的报告。现在我代表党军委，就军事工作作一简要发言。
    （一）中国人民解放军的英勇奋斗
    中国人民解放军走过的道路，是一条漫长曲折的道路，是从无到有，从小到大，经过反复的胜利和失败而最后走向胜利的。
    中国共产党建立以后，就积极推动和促成了国共合作，领导和参加了我国一九二四年到一九二七年的大革命。当革命势力伸入长江流域，工人农民运动大发展的时候，代表帝国主义和封建势力的国民党反动派，就立刻暴露了反革命面目，于一九二七年春夏之交发动反革命政变，以史无前例的白色恐怖袭击了当时的革命势力，成千成万的共产党员和革命群众被屠杀了。但是共产党和革命人民并没有被压服，相反地激起极大的义愤，纷纷以武装起义回答了反动派的白色恐怖。其中最著名的有南昌起义、秋收起义和广州起义，并且在起义中建立了中国工农红军。
    一九二七年十月，秋收起义部队的一部分在毛泽东同志领导下，首先进到湘、赣边境的井冈山地区，随后朱德同志领导下的南昌起义部队的一部分到达井冈山会合，建立了以井冈山为中心的湘、赣边区革命根据地，举起镰刀锤头的红旗，喊出打土豪分田地的口号，向全国人民指出了一条正确的奋斗道路，形成了当时全国革命的中心。在这个中心影响之下，许多省区人民在共产党领导之下纷纷建立红军游击队和革命根据地，进行土地革命。各地区红军游击队，经过几年反
  “围剿”的激烈斗争，在大量消灭国民党军队和地主武装之后，发展到三十万人，建立了千万人口以上的革命根据地。然而，到了一九三一年党被王明、博古教条主义错误所统治，无论政治路线和军事路线都犯了严重的“左”倾机会主义错误，使多年辛苦流血建立起来的革命根据地几乎全部丧失，人民军队也几乎全部消灭。具有伟大历史意义的遵义会议，纠正了“左”倾错误的领导，确立了毛泽东同志在中央的领导地位，才扭转了这个危险的局势，红军的基本战斗骨干才得以保存下来。这个时期，我党我军受到了极大的锻炼，积累了丰富的政治斗争和军事斗争的经验，使全党全军基本上认识了一条正确的政治路线和军事路线，从而为抗日战争准备了极有利的条件。
    一九三一年日本帝国主义侵占东北后继续向华北进犯，到一九三七年“七七”，即向我国举行大规模的军事进攻。我党与国民党重新合作，红军改编为八路军、新四军，进行伟大的抗日战争。根据党中央洛川会议决定的纲领和方针，我军开赴华北、华中前线，对敌人展开游击战争，建立抗日根据地和三三制政权，组织人民抗日斗争，帮助人民减租减息，救灾度荒，并利用战斗空隙，进行生产，以减轻人民负担。抗战八年中，我军在日寇反复“扫荡”、实行三光政策（杀光、烧光、抢光）和国民党顽固派夹击的严重情况下，始终坚持了敌后抗日游击战争，抗击了侵华日军的百分之六十以上和伪军的百分之九十以上，成为抗日战争的主力军。到抗日战争结束时，我军已发展到一百三十万人，抗日根据地人口有一亿六千万，创造了中国人民历史上空前强大的革命力量。
    抗日战争结束后，饱受战争摧残的中国人民，迫切要求和平，要求民主改革。我党代表中国人民这一要求，曾经与国民党进行谈判，希望通过和平道路，实现中国的民主改革。国民党反动派，开始伪装和平与我谈判，企图以此麻痹人民，争取时间，集结兵力，消灭我军；等到兵力集结完毕，即撕破和平的假面具，用超过我军三倍以上的优势兵力，在美国帝国主义支援下，向解放区大举进攻，迫使人民又一次接受了战争。由于我党中央在试探和平民主改革的同时，就英明而及时地告诫我们，不能放松警惕，不能放下武器。因而当国民党反革命军队向解放区发动全面进攻的时候，解放区的人民和军队乃能从容不迫地起而应战。我军在毛泽东同志的十大军事原则的指导下，在全国人民的支持下，经过三年半的激烈战斗，消灭了敌军八百余万，解放了除台湾省和少数岛屿以外的全部国土，赢得了战争的全面胜利。
    全国胜利以后，我军为了保护民主改革和支援经济恢复工作，在全国各地肃清了国民党特务和土匪武装，并迅速进行大规模的复员和转业，参加国家的各种建设工作。
    这里还需要特别提出，正当我国人民集中力量进行和平建设，我军进行大量复员转业时，朝鲜战争爆发了。美帝国主义公开宣布侵占我国的领土台湾，又悍然不顾我国人民的严重警告，盗用联合国名义，纠合十六国侵略军越过朝鲜三八线，进逼鸭绿江，轰炸我东北，直接威胁我国的安全。在这种情况下，中国人民为了抗美援朝保家卫国，又被迫组织人民志愿军，同朝鲜人民军一起，抵御了侵略军的进攻，在中朝人民和国际和平力量的支持与鼓舞下，经过近三年的战争，把侵略军打回到三八线，迫使他们不得不与朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军停战。从而，保卫了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和我国东北的安全；证明了这个世界上头号的帝国主义军队，是可以被打败的；显示了中国人民的伟大力量，提高了我国人民的民族自信心，鼓舞了全世界人民争取和平反对战争的斗争。
    如上所述，中国人民解放军从诞生的一天起，就面对着国内外的强大敌人。然而，不论敌人多么强大、有多么优越的条件，中国革命战争终于以我军的胜利和敌人的失败而告终。
    我军为什么能够在长期的严重战争中，在极端困难的情况下，生存、发展和壮大呢？为什么能够战胜国内外的强大敌人而取得革命战争胜利
  呢？
      中国人民解放军之所以能够胜利，是由于有中国共产党的正确领导。我党鉴于中国是一个半殖民地半封建的国家，长期处于帝国主义和封建势力的残酷压迫剥削之下，中国人民特别是工人农民的生活状况极端贫困，民族独立民主改革的要求极端迫切，因此就提出了反帝反封建的革命纲领。我党鉴于国内外反革命势力拥有雄厚的武装力量，做为统治人民和镇压革命的主要手段，以及陈独秀右倾机会主义放弃武装斗争而遭到失败的教训，因此确定武装斗争为中国革命的主要斗争形式。毛泽东同志指出：“在中国，离开了武装斗争，就没有无产阶级和共产党的地位，就不能完成任何的革命任务”。我党鉴于城市反革命力量雄厚，革命力量很难生存和发展；农村地区广大，反革命控制比较薄弱。因此确定了首先实行农村武装割据、农村包围城市，然后夺取城市的方针。这就使我军明确了奋斗的方向和应走的道路。
    我党中央还根据各个时期的实际情况，规定了正确的政治路线和军事路线。所有这些都集中表现在党中央的决议、指示和毛泽东同志的著作中。毛泽东同志根据马克思列宁主义的科学理论和中国革命的具体实践，对中国革命、中国革命战争和我军建设问题作了详尽的光辉的阐发。这些著作，一直就是我军进行革命战争的行动指针和战斗纲领。历史证明，凡是执行了党中央和毛泽东同志的正确领导，革命战争就获得胜利，反之就招致严重的失败。一九三一到一九三四年的“左”倾机会主义带给我军的严重损失，以及后来张国焘逃跑主义分裂主义路线和皖南事变所带给我军的损失，都是惨痛的历史教训。
    显而易见，革命军队要取得胜利避免失败，必须有党的正确领导，必须全军上下团结一致地坚决服从党的正确领导。否则，想要取得胜利是不可能的。
    中国人民解放军之所以能够取得胜利，是由于广大人民的拥护和支援。我军同人民的利益和要求完全一致，跟人民的关系就如鱼和水一样密切。广大人民从亲身体验中，认识到我军作战的目的不是为了别的，正是为了人民的解放和幸福。人民把自己的命运同我军的命运联系在一起，亲切地把我军看为自己的“子弟兵”。
    正因为这样，人民就成为军队兵员补充的源泉。在战争时期，经过充分的群众工作后，人民就自动地、踊跃地投入到我军中来。
    正因为这样，人民就自动成为我军军需、粮秣的供给者。每个家庭就成为我军的工厂、仓库和医院，保证了我军的衣、食、住、行所需要的一切。
    正因为这样，人民就在我党的领导之下，自愿地组成自卫队、民兵，配合我军作战，展开袭击、爆炸运动，清除奸细，侦察敌情，运送伤兵粮弹，充当向导，使我军获得了作战的各种有利条件。
    中国人民解放军之所以能够胜利，因为它是人民的军队。毛泽东同志说：“他们不是为着少数人的或狭隘集团的私利，而是为着广大人民群众的利益，为着全民族的利益，而结合，而战斗的。紧紧地和中国人民站在一起，全心全意地为中国人民服务，就是这个军队的唯一的宗旨。”我军历史上虽然番号、任务、作战对象等有过多次的变化，但人民军队的本质和为人民服务的宗旨，在任何时候也没有改变过和动摇过。
    因为我军是人民的军队，所以全体成员都具有高度的自觉性和积极性，都了解自己为谁而战，为什么而战，有着高尚的革命理想和明确的奋斗方向。因此，他们在战斗中就能英勇、顽强地打击敌人，不仅有一往无前的勇气，而且能发挥高度的智慧，研究出许多适合情况的作战方法，抗日战争中的地道战，解放战争中的爆破战，抗美援朝战争中的坑道战，都是广大官兵所创造。因此，他们都具有高度的政治责任感，在激烈战斗中遇有军官阵亡或负伤时，下级军官和士兵即自动代理进行指挥，有时剩下几个人甚至一个人仍独立坚持战斗，决不因情况危急，放弃自己的战斗责任。
    因为我军是人民的军队，所以内部没有互相倾轧，没有争权夺利，不分这一部分部队和那一部分部队，不分老部队和新部队，不分军官和士兵，都在为人民服务的目标下团结起来，齐心合力，互相支援，完成共同的任务。
    因为我军是人民的军队，所以就能处处为人民利益着想，关怀人民痛苦；一有可能，就帮助人民劳动生产，帮助人民克服困难；尊重人民风俗习惯，不侵犯人民利益。因此，我军所到之处就能与人民结成血肉的联系，共同为人民解放事业奋斗。
    因为我军是人民的军队，所以就有克服一切困难的精神。我军长期是和优势之敌作战，装备低劣、弹药困难、衣食不足、医药奇缺，既无薪饷，又得不到适当的休整，长征中的艰苦情况，更是罕见罕闻，所有这些困难，都未难倒我们，总是我们克服了困难，取得了胜利。
    综上所述，坚决服从党对军队的正确领导，密切联系人民群众，永远保持人民革命军队的本质，这就是我军取得胜利的根本保证。因此，我军中任何同志都没有理由骄傲自满，必须勤勤恳恳、兢兢业业地在过去胜利的基础上克服缺点，力求进步，才能完成我军在伟大社会主义时期的历史任务。
    （二）军队任务和建设方针
    中华人民共和国的成立，开始了我国社会主义建设和社会主义改造的新时期，我军在这个新时期的任务就是：保卫祖国的社会主义建设，保卫国家的主权、领土完整和安全，随时准备解放台湾，巩固国内和平秩序。目前的国际形势虽然趋向和缓，但是美帝国主义侵略集团没有放弃军事侵略计划，坚持仇视我国人民的政策，霸占我国的领土台湾，在我国邻近组织军事侵略集团，建立军事侵略基地，并且正在用新式武器加强这些基地，因此，防御帝国主义的侵略，保卫我国建设的安全，就成为我军今后最主要的任务。
    全国大陆解放以后，我党中央和我国政府就明确指出，中国人民解放军要在原有的基础上，建设成为一支优良的现代化革命军队。我们建设这样一支军队的目的，就是为了防御帝国主义侵略、保卫我国安全。除此以外，没有别的目的。只有美国战争贩子，为着掩饰他们准备发动侵略战争的罪恶目的，为着吓唬某些国家替他们火中取栗，并且进一步奴役这些国家，才故意把我军的建设说成是对别国的威胁。但是造谣不能掩盖事实，近几年来，许多国家的人民和领导人在同我国的来往中，逐渐了解了我国政府和人民要求和平的真诚愿望，识破了美国战争贩子的阴谋，因而愿意和我国和平共处的国家就日益增多起来。我们从来没有想过，也永远不会想对别的国家进行侵略。因为我们的国家是工人阶级领导的、工农联盟为基础的社会主义国家，任何时候，任何侵略行动都是同我们国家的本质不相容的。我国的社会主义本质，是决定我们和平外交政策的根本出发点，也是决定我军采取战略防御方针的根本出发点。我们决不侵略别人，但是也决不容许别人侵略我们。如果侵略集团不顾一切对我国发动侵略战争，我国军民必然奋起应战，给侵略者以坚决的打击，直到最后消灭他们为止。
    七年来，我们根据中央的方针，在国防建设方面进行了巨大的工作。
    根据实际情况的需要，我军集体转入生产建设的部队已经有三十一个师另八个团，加上转业的干部和复员的士兵已达五百万人。目前我军员额包括征集的新兵在内，比全国解放时的最高额已经裁减了二百七十余万人。军费开支已由一九五一年占国家总开支的百分之四十八，降到一九五六年的百分之十九·九八。我们完全同意苏联提出的国际裁军的建议，只要在这个问题上能够达成协议，我们仍然愿意进一步裁减我们的军队。
    我军过去基本上是单一步兵组成的军队，现在已经在步兵的基础上组建了空军、海军、防空军、公安军、以及炮兵、装甲兵、工程兵、铁道兵、通信兵和防化学兵等，建成了诸兵种合成的军队，完成了我军有史以来的重大转变。步兵在我军战史上曾经发挥过极大的作用，是我军的基本兵种，目前仍然在全军中保持最大的比例，装备已经有了基本改变；炮兵、坦克兵有了很大的加强；其他兵种技术装备也有了很大的改善。空军和防空军是现代战争中的重要军种，现在我国的空军虽然比不上最大的空军国家，但也已经不是很弱的空军国家了；防空军已经建设起来，并有了相当新式的技术装备。海军的建设也有了相应的发展。虽然由于我军现代化建设为时不久，各军种、兵种还未能达到完全现代化的程度，但是已经达到我国空前未有的规模。随着国家经济建设的迅速发展，我军现代化水平必将进一步获得提高。在这里，我要表示对于我们伟大盟邦苏联的感谢，因为苏联在供应军事装备和帮助我们建设国防工业方面，作了兄弟般的努力。
    在改善军队技术装备同时，全军展开了提高指挥能力和技术操作，提高政治觉悟和科学文化水平的正规训练。因为军队有了现代化的装备和组织编制以后，如果没有坚强的指挥干部和熟练的技术人员，则一切好的装备都将无法充分发挥作用。因此，这几年来，军官训练和部队训练是我军经常工作的中心。到目前为止，全军已经开办了各种学院和学校，使大量经过战争锻炼的干部得到了深造，现代战争规律知识和技术知识有了很大的提高。部队的训练质量有了显著的进步，在执行任务和演习中已经显示了巨大成效。
    正规化的军事制度，是现代化军队的重要条件。特别是我军过去长期处于分散环境，各个部队的军事制度不完全统一，因此，在现代化建设中，强调正规化的建设，具有重要的意义。所谓正规化就是统一指挥、统一编制、统一制度、统一训练和统一纪律，目前全军在这方面，都有了相应的条令、条例和规定，并且在部队训练、工作和生活秩序等方面，已经获得显著的成绩。
    为着保证实现我军战略防御的方针，抵抗帝国主义可能的突然袭击，几年来我军在国防前线和纵深战略要点进行了现代的国防工程建筑。如果帝国主义侵略集团一天不肯放弃侵略计划，我们的国防工程就要不断地加强和改进。我们坚信，这种国防工程与掌握现代武器的人民军队相结合，任何敌人对我国发动的侵略，都不可能达到他们所幻想的目的。
    现代战争的战场是辽阔的，所需的人力物力是巨大的。为着有效地防御帝国主义可能发动的突然袭击，我们必须认真解决常备军队和后备人员的结合问题，解决国民经济平时和战时的结合问题。在人力方面，除了常备军以外，必须积蓄雄厚的预备役军官和士兵作为后备。我国把志愿兵制改为义务兵役制，开始进行预备役军官、士兵的登记和训练，在高等学校中逐步增加军事训练课程，就是为着这个目的。在物力方面，必须储备一定数量的武器和物资作为战争初期的需要，战争整个进程中所需要的大量装备和物资，必须依靠国民经济从平时生产迅速转入战时生产来解决，必须依靠平时民用生产部门储备必要的军事生产设备和技术力量来解决。只有平时在国民经济计划中进行充分的准备，战争未来之前才能集中财力、物力、人力进行经济建设，战争一旦爆发就能迅速发挥最大的战时生产能力，以源源不断的物资，支援全国军队作战，保证战争的胜利。
    总之，我国人民需要一个持久和平的环境，进行社会主义建设，也需要一支现代化的革命军队，应付可能突然发生的事变，保卫社会主义建设。我们的责任就在于把这两方面的需要恰当地统一起来。因而我们既要抓紧军队的现代化建设，又要在军队的建设中，适应国家经济建设的要求，尽量节约，反对浪费，一切军事措施，就要照顾人民的生产利益和生活利益，保持我军同人民的密切联系，发扬人民革命军队克勤克俭、艰苦朴素的作风。几年来，我们的建军工作已经做出很多成绩。但是由于经验不足，研究情况不够，在工作中也发生过严重的缺点，例如在军队整编初期，对于改进技术装备有要求过急过多的偏向；在军队正规化的过程中，在进行国防工程建筑中，曾经发生影响官兵团结和军民团结的现象；在学习现代化建军经验中，曾经没有很好照顾具体情况采取了一些不恰当的训练方法和工作方法等。这些缺点，有些已经纠正，应该避免重犯，有些还没有纠正的，需要注意克服。希望地方党委经常给军队工作以领导和监督。
  （三）建军中必须坚持的几个制度
    为着完成我军现代化建设的任务，根据我们的经验和部队实际情况，必须坚持以下几个制度。
      一、军队的领导工作制度
      中国人民解放军领导工作的根本制度，就是党委集体领导下的首长分工负责制。这是我军长期行之有效的领导制度。
    军队中各级共产党的委员会，是按照党的民主集中制建立起来的。它遵照马克思列宁主义的原则，对于部队工作实施党的集体领导。部队中的一切重大问题，例如上级的重要指示、命令，军事、政治、后勤等工作的规划、安排，干部调配等等，除了在紧急情况下，部队首长可以按照自己的职权机断处置以外，都要召开党委会议进行民主讨论，集中大家的智慧，做出明确的决定，然后交给部队军政首长负责组织执行。
    在我军中，军事指挥员和政治委员都是部队的首长，共同负责领导部队工作。同时，他们之间又有分工，对上级的命令、指示和同级党委的决定，属于军事工作方面的，由军事指挥员负责组织执行，属于政治工作方面的，由政治委员负责组织执行。
    在军队中必须实行党委的集体领导，是因为只有这样，才能更好地保证党对军队的领导，保证党的政策与国家的法令贯彻执行，防止领导干部中的单纯军事观点和个人主义的倾向。只有这样，才能发挥集体智慧，弥补个人能力的不足，防止个人看问题的主观片面性，使军队中的各项工作，特别是作战行动，都放在经过周密思考的较为稳妥的基础上。只有这样，才能使部门首长了解全盘情况，统一认识，更好地保障部队的集中指挥、统一行动和按照实际情况灵活地正确地处理问题。
    为着健全党委集体领导，必须在工作中贯彻民主作风和群众路线的工作方法，加强与广大干部、士兵间的亲密联系，经常深入下层检查工作，总结和推广群众的先进经验，用批评与自我批评的方法纠正工作中的缺点和错误，以防止党委领导同志因脱离群众脱离实际而犯官僚主义和单纯命令主义的错误。党委对于工作做出决定之后，就要放手交给部队首长去作，以发挥首长个人负责的积极性和创造精神，党委干预日常业务工作包办一切的做法是不对的。
    在军队中必须实行首长分工负责制，是因为我军是执行战斗任务的革命武装组织。如果没有首长坚决负责的态度和强有力的及时指挥，复杂的合成军队在紧急的战斗情况中，就会引起行动的混乱，甚至招致战斗的不利；在工作中，也会造成迟缓和无人负责的现象。所以各级首长必须在党委的集体领导下，按照分工，积极主动地履行自己的职责。认为有了党委的集体领导，就可以减轻首长责任的想法和做法，也是不对的。
    党委集体领导与首长分工负责相结合的领导制度，在我军长期实践中，已经形成较为完善的领导制度。只要能对于这一制度作全面的理解，在执行中对于集体领导和分工负责两方面均能正确运用，不予偏重偏废，那么，它不仅不会削弱军队的集中统一，而且能更有力地保证军队的集中统一；不仅不影响军队在紧急情况下的机动，而且更能保证正确的机动。军队现代化以后，兵种复杂，就更加需要发挥这一领导制度的良好作用，而不是削弱它。
      二、军队政治工作制度
    从中国人民解放军创建的时候起，中国共产党就在军队中建立了政治工作制度。在长期战争考验中，依靠党的正确领导，依靠政治工作人员和全军同志的努力，我军政治工作有了丰富的经验，对于巩固内部团结，提高战斗力，动员广大人民群众支援和参加革命战争，瓦解和争取敌军，从而保证战争胜利，作出了重大贡献。政治工作已经成为我军的生命线。
    军队政治工作，在实质上就是军队中党的工作，政治机关就是党的工作机关。党通过政治机关，领导全军的政治思想教育工作，树立全体军人的爱国主义和共产主义思想，克服各种错误的思想和作风；领导部队贯彻执行党中央的政治路线和政府的法律、法令；领导部队党的组织、青年团的组织和广大官兵群众，自觉地坚决地执行上级命令、指示和完成军队中的各项任务。
    政治工作必须为军队的战斗和工作服务。军队政治工作的任务，只能根据军队的基本任务和各项具体任务去规定。我军的基本任务，在过去就是为实现民族民主革命的胜利，在今后，就是防御帝国主义侵略，保卫祖国社会主义建设。我军的具体任务，除了作战以外，在平时就是以训练为中心的军队建设、作战准备和各项经常工作。当前我军政治工作的具体任务，就是要对部队进行充分的政治思想教育，启发部队的政治觉悟，进一步巩固军内团结和军民团结，发挥所有革命军人的工作积极性、创造性，提高部队的战斗力和保持对于帝国主义可能的突然袭击的高度警惕，以确实保证我军今后的基本任务和各项具体任务的贯彻执行。
    为着正确发挥政治工作的作用，在我军中，就不容许有轻视或削弱政治工作领导地位的倾向，也要防止不适当地强调政治工作特殊地位和特殊权力的倾向。政治工作必须主动地与军事工作保持融洽协调的关系，并要善于组织全体军人参加政治工作，只有如此，政治工作才能充分发挥作用，完成自己的任务。
    我军政治工作在新的历史条件下，除了必须继续坚持和发扬工作中的群众路线和民主作风，深入实际和联系群众的作风，批评与自我批评的作风等以外，为了适应军队现代化的特点，还必须深入到各种军事活动中去，具体了解所在单位的业务技术情况，虚心学习为自己工作所必需的业务技术知识，防止脱离实际的主观主义倾向，使军队政治工作在新的情况下，充满活力地向前发展。
        三、军队民主制度
      中国人民解放军是一支有坚强的革命纪律的军队，又是一支有高度民主生活的军队。我军从创建开始，就彻底摧毁了军阀军队的专横制度，采用了广泛的民主措施，在一九二九年古田会议以后的长期斗争中，逐渐形成了在集中领导下的民主制度。这个制度是和党委集体领导制度、政治工作制度密切联系不可分割的。没有民主制度，党委集体领导和政治工作就会成为形式；没有党委集体领导和政治工作的保证，也就不可能有真正集中领导下的民主。
    我军之所以能够实行民主，就是因为我军是人民进行解放自己的斗争工具。我们军队上下级之间、官兵之间以及军民之间，根本利益一致，奋斗目标一致，不存在敌对的阶级矛盾或私人的利害冲突。
    我军之所以必须实行民主，就是因为我军进行的事业是六亿人民解放的伟大事业，我军所执行的任务是用战争方式摧毁反革命武装力量的艰巨任务，要完成这个伟大的事业绝非少数人的智慧所能办到，必须依靠全军成员对于革命事业的高度积极性和创造性。而要达到这个目的，就必须实行集中领导下的民主制度。过去是如此，今后也必须如此。
    在我军中，民主是多方面的，不单是在党的组织和青年团的组织生活中有民主，而且在日常工作中和战斗中也有民主。一切较重大的工作，只要条件许可，经过党委集体讨论决定以后，即运用民主和群众路线的方法，交给下级官兵讨论，采用他们的合理建议。在战斗中，只要条件许可，就把战斗任务、取得胜利的条件和办法，告诉全体官兵，发动他们进行广泛而深入的讨论，使领导者的计划和决心变成群众的计划和决心。战斗结束以后，即举行民主评议，总结战斗经验，评比每个官兵的功绩或过错，使所有官兵受到一次深切的实际训练。在日常工作中，我们有各种会议生活，通过这些会议，研究和总结工作，表扬先进经验，批评缺点错误。为了做好工作，不仅上级批评下级，下级也可以批评上级，士兵也可以批评军官，军官必须虚心倾听下级官兵的意见和接受正确的批评，绝不容许有压制批评、打击批评者的行为，对于不适当的批评和意见只能进行解释。经验证明，实行这样的民主并不损害干部的威信，相反地，用民主领导形成起来的心悦诚服的威信，才是真正经得起考验的威信。我军纪律的维持，也主要是采取民主的办法，不是单纯依靠上级约束和监督下级，而是采用群众的自我批评教育，提高政治觉悟的办法，自己约束自己，大家约束大家。这种自觉纪律，有上级的监督固然可以维持，没有上级的监督同样可以维持。在平时固然可以维持，在战时最复杂最困难的情况下，同样也可以维持。
    我军过去有某些同志不重视发扬民主，我们曾对此进行过严肃的批评和斗争。现在由于我军进行现代化正规化的建设，于是又有某些同志对于民主制度发生怀疑，以为现代战争既要求指挥上的高度集中，强调民主就没有必要了。这种认识是错误的。他们不了解，我军的现代化正规化并未改变人民军队的本质，真正的高度集中只能建立在高度民主的基础上，单纯依靠强制办法建立起来的集中，只是一种虚假的经不起考验的集中。因此，我们在现代化正规化建设中，必须反对削弱民主的倾向，必须进一步加强民主，发扬民主。
      （四）学习问题
    现代化革命军队，不仅必须用现代科学技术装备起来，还必须用马克思列宁主义、现代军事科学武装起来。而现代军事科学是各种科学的集中表现，现代化革命军队的军官必须具备各种各样的科学、文化、技术知识和现代战争规律知识。可是我们在这方面恰恰是很不够的。因此，学习就成为我们压倒一切的中心任务。我们除加强马克思列宁主义和毛泽东著作的学习以外，必须加紧学习现代军事科学技术，学习现代化军队的作战指挥和新的军事制度。如果我们不加紧学好这些东西，就不能掌握和使用最新式的武器和指挥现代化军队作战，因而也就不能把我军建设成为优良的现代化革命军队。
    我军在现代化建设的开始，提出把苏军的一切先进经验完全学到手的要求是正确的，几年来我们的学习成绩是很大的。毫无疑问，苏军的先进经验仍为我军今后学习的主要方向，因为它是最先进的现代化革命军队，它的军事科学是优越的，军事技术是头等的，现代化军队作战的指挥经验是丰富的。我们努力学习苏军的一切先进经验，可以缩短摸索过程，少走弯路，迅速完成我军的现代化建设。当然，我们也应当学习其他兄弟国家军队的先进经验。对于资本主义国家的军事问题我们也应当研究，以便达到知己又知彼的目的。他们的技术科学，只要是对于我们有用的，我们也应当学习。
    我们在学习外国军事经验的时候，必须有虚心的态度。没有虚心的态度，就钻不进去，学不到东西。我们有些同志在学习问题上存在骄傲自满的情绪，以为我们打败过日本军队，打败过帝国主义武装起来的国民党军队，中国人民志愿军又在朝鲜打败过美国军队，以为我们的经验已足够应付现在和将来的一切，因而似乎可以不学习别人的长处了。这种态度是错误的。但这是否说，我们以往的军事经验，今后就完全不适用呢？不是这样，我们以往的许多宝贵经验，今后不但不能抛弃，而且必须继续保持和发扬，例如我军在长期革命战争中形成起来的建军原则和战争指导原则，中国人民志愿军在朝鲜作战的经验，在今后还是极有用的。我们在学习中应该把我军的历史经验和外国的先进军事经验结合起来。
    我们学习外国军事经验的时候，又必须采取分析批判、实事求是的科学态度，不能迷信盲从，机械搬用。因为不论外国或自己的任何具体经验，都有时间、地点和其他各种条件的特点，在外国是正确的经验，而在我国我军的具体情况下，就可能是不正确或不完全正确的，即使我们自己过去的正确经验，在今后因为情况的变化也可能是不正确或不完全正确的，怎么能够不从实际出发进行分析批判就生吞活剥呢？以此来检查我们的学习，虽然有很大成绩，但也有严重缺点。近几年来我军所颁布的条令和制度，所采用的教学方法，基本上是适用的，但是有些地方没有很好照顾我军的历史特点和实际情况，存在着教条主义和形式主义，削弱了我军的优良传统，影响了军内外的团结。因此，我们必须纠正这种错误的学习态度，采用实事求是的科学的学习态度。
    向实际学习，向群众学习，是我们过去的根本学习方法，近几年有些同志把它忘记了，不去深入实际、了解实际和研究实际，对于自己应该熟悉的实际情况，不甚了解，对于广大群众的创造茫然无知，或者熟视无睹。我们应该了解，群众的实践活动是知识的源泉，是检验真理的标准，只有深入实际，才能发现实际中存在的困难和矛盾，才能找到克服困难和解决矛盾的原则和方法。只有深入实际，才能发现条令、制度、命令、指示的正确程度，才能找到修改它们的根据。只有深入实际，才能发现和亲自体会群众所创造的新事物和它的意义，才能把群众的零散的无系统的新创造集中起来，把实际中取得的经验与书本知识结合起来。
    我军有丰富的战争经验和建军经验，只要我们采取虚心和孜孜不倦的学习态度，端正学习的方法，纠正机械搬用、脱离实际、脱离群众的缺点，相信我们就能够把苏联和国际上一切先进军事经验学到手，并把这些经验与我军的历史经验和现代化建设中实践经验结合起来，逐步形成适合我国实际情况的现代军事科学。
    同志们！党的第八次代表大会的任务胜利的完成，将是全国人民走向新胜利的起点。中国人民解放军在大会胜利的鼓舞下，将会更好地执行现代化建设、解放台湾、保卫祖国的光荣任务。只要我们全军同志继续努力，谦虚谨慎，戒骄戒躁，努力学习，克服缺点，在党和政府的领导下，在全国人民和国家强大经济力量的支持下，我们就一定能够完成现代化建设、解放台湾、保卫祖国的光荣任务。我们要永远和伟大的苏联军队站在一起，和各兄弟国家的军队站在一起，和全世界爱好和平的人民站在一起，为保卫世界和平而奋斗。
