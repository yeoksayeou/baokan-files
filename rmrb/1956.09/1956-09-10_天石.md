    "Heavenly Stone"
    Gao Shiqi
    In ancient times, Egyptians called iron "heavenly stone." They already used iron when they built the pyramids.

    At that time, iron was as difficult to find as gold. The iron they used probably came partly from meteorites that fell from the sky.

    Arabs also have this legend. They say, "Iron is produced in the sky. The sky rains gold on the desert, gold turns into silver, and silver turns into black iron." This is a small story about iron.

    Astronomers, when observing celestial bodies, also tell us that all celestial bodies contain iron. In their spectral lines, we can always see the light emitted by iron atoms. On the surface of the sun, we often see iron atoms flowing, and every year, many iron atoms fall onto the earth, which is the source of meteorites.

    However, for a long time, iron has not been widely used because meteorites falling from the sky are ultimately rare.

    Scientists also tell us that the earth's crust itself contains 4.5% iron. Among all the metals around us, iron is the most abundant except for aluminum. However, this kind of iron is buried deep underground and is not easy to excavate. Fortunately, due to complex chemical reactions, a lot of iron ore has accumulated on the surface of our earth.

    People learned to extract iron from iron ore around the year 1000 AD. Initially, they made tools such as plows, hoes, shovels, and axes out of iron. This was the beginning of the Iron Age.

    Many centuries passed before iron was moved out of small-scale iron smelters and into automated blast furnaces for production after the nineteenth century. Then we had the modern iron and steel industry.

    From small screws to large machines, from swords to cannons and tanks, all require iron. Iron is an important raw material for us to manufacture production tools and national defense weapons.

    Iron is not only so important in industry, but also closely related to the biological world.

    It is said that the formation of iron ore is related to microorganisms. When rainwater washes large amounts of iron from various rocks into lakes and swamps, a type of bacteria called iron bacteria becomes active in the lakes and swamps, using iron as nourishment. As a result of the proliferation of iron bacteria, iron turns into pea-sized or larger lumps and sediments down. Over time, iron ore is formed.

    The relationship between iron and living things is not limited to this.

    If they do not get the nourishment of iron, the entire biological world will panic. The flowers of plants will fade and lose their fragrance, the leaves will also wither, and humans and animals will also become anemic.

    With iron, there is chlorophyll. Relying on it, plants can absorb sunlight, turn carbon dioxide and water into starch, and release oxygen.

    With iron, the lives of animals are guaranteed. In the blood of vertebrates, iron is the main component of hemoglobin in red blood cells. In the tissues of invertebrates, it is also indispensable.

    Iron is truly a wonderful "heavenly stone."

    “天石”
    高士其
    古时候，埃及人把铁叫做“天石”。在他们建造金字塔的时候，已经用过铁了。
    那时候，铁和金子一样，很不容易找，他们所用的铁，大约有一部分是来自天上掉下来的陨石。
    阿拉伯人也有这种传说。他们说：“铁是出产在天上的，天把金雨降落在沙漠上，金子变成了银子，银子又变成了黑色的铁。”这是铁的小小故事。
    天文学家在观测天体的时候，也告诉我们：一切天体都含有铁。在它们的光谱线上，随时都可以看到铁原子所发出的光。在太阳的表面，也时常看到铁原子在奔流，每年都有不少铁原子，向地球身上降落，这就是陨石的来源。
    但是，长久以来，铁得不到普遍的应用，因为从天上掉下来的陨石，究竟很少。
    科学家又告诉我们：地壳的本身，就含有4.5％的铁，我们周围的一切金属，除了铝以外，铁要算是最多了。但是，这种铁，埋藏在地下很深，不容易发掘。亏得我们地球的表面，由于复杂的化学反应，还聚集了不少的铁矿石。
    人们学会了从铁矿石里炼出铁来，还是公元后一千年的事。最初，他们用铁制成了犁、锄、铲、斧等工具。这是铁器时代的开始。
    又过了好多世纪，直到了十九世纪以后，铁才从小规模熔铁炉里搬出来，到自动化的高炉里去生产。于是我们才有现代化的钢铁工业。
    从小螺丝钉到大型机器；从刀剑到大炮坦克，都需要铁，铁是我们制造生产工具和国防武器的重要原料。
    铁，不但在工业上是这样重要，它和生物界的关系也很密切。
    据说：铁矿的形成，和微生物有关。当雨水把大量的铁，从各种岩石里冲洗到湖沼里的时候，湖沼里有一种细菌叫做铁菌，就活跃起来，它们以铁为滋养。由于铁菌繁殖的结果，铁就变成豌豆般大小，或者更大的块粒，沉积下来。时间久了，就形成了铁矿。
    铁和生物的关系，还不止这一点。
    如果得不到铁的滋养，全生物界都要发生恐慌。植物的花就要褪色，失去香味，叶子也要枯萎起来，人和动物也要贫血。
    有了铁，才有叶绿素，靠着它，植物才能吸收阳光，把二氧化炭和水制成淀粉，放出氧气。
    有了铁，动物的生命才有保证。在脊椎动物的血液里，铁是红血球里的血色素的主要成分。在无脊椎动物的组织里，也少不了它。
    铁，真是一种奇妙的“天石”。
