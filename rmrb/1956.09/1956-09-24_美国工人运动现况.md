Current Situation of the American Workers' Movement
    Lù Guǒmù
    Rampant Attacks by Monopoly Capital
    In pursuit of maximum profits, American monopoly capital is rampantly attacking the American working class, intensifying cruel exploitation on the one hand and carrying out tyrannical persecution on the other.

    Monopoly enterprises universally adopt the "speed-up system" and "automated operation," greatly increasing the labor intensity of workers. This increases the company's profits. For workers, the result is that many lose their jobs, and some can only find part-time work. Employed workers, in order to earn a decent wage, have to work overtime, resulting in excessive fatigue and serious work-related injuries. According to official statistics, more than 14,000 people died from work-related injuries last year, and about 1.91 million were injured. Although some enterprises have slightly increased wages due to the workers' heroic struggles, the constantly rising cost of living quickly offsets this increase. American monopoly capital also uses the threat of unemployment to force workers to increase labor intensity and depress wages. The "Barron's" weekly of the American monopoly capital group even openly stated: "The only way to urge workers to complete their daily production quotas is to threaten their children with starvation."

    At the same time, American monopoly capital uses government authorities to carry out various persecutions against the working class. In order to further undermine the basic rights of workers, the U.S. Congress has passed more than a dozen pieces of legislation this year that are directly aimed at opposing trade unions. These legislations stipulate that the government has the right to declare any trade union illegal on the grounds of so-called "Communist infiltration," and capitalists have the right to arbitrarily dismiss workers on similar grounds. According to these reactionary legislations, the U.S. Labor Relations Board has declared the International Fur Workers Union of the United States to be "illegal" and exiled the union's vice chairman, Irving Potash. To date, hundreds of progressive trade union leaders in the United States have been interrogated, and they are all victims of these reactionary legislations. In addition, monopoly capital directly dispatches special agents and thugs to sabotage strikes and murder trade union leaders. For example, Charlie Vermillion, an activist of the Coal Miners Union, was murdered in this way by the reactionary authorities of Clay, Kentucky.

    Workers' Class Unyielding Struggle
    Faced with the increasingly rampant attacks of monopoly capital, the heroic American working class is also waging an unyielding struggle.

    Strikes are currently a major form of struggle for American workers against monopoly capital. According to the U.S. Department of Labor statistics, a total of 4,200 strikes occurred in the United States in 1955, with 2.75 million workers participating, including 26 large-scale strikes with more than 100,000 participants. From January to May this year, 1,750 strikes also occurred in the United States, with 730,000 workers participating. On July 1, the United Steelworkers of America began a massive strike involving 650,000 people. After five weeks of struggle, the capitalists were finally forced to agree to increase wages, and the strike ended. These strikes were mainly aimed at increasing wages and improving working conditions, opposing capitalists' increase in labor intensity and mass layoffs of workers.

    Faced with various threats and persecutions from capitalists and the government, workers have demonstrated a tenacious fighting spirit in strikes. For example, the strike of more than 50,000 workers at Westinghouse Electric Company, which began in October 1955, lasted for 156 days. This was the longest strike in the United States in more than 20 years involving tens of thousands of workers. The strike of 3,000 streetcar and bus drivers in Washington last year also lasted for 53 days. The strike of 12,000 textile workers in New England lasted for several months. Even in the South, where the labor movement has a relatively weak foundation, some strikes have lasted for several months.

    New Stage of Labor Unification Movement
    In the actual struggle against the attacks of monopoly capital, the American working class is increasingly aware of the importance of unity and solidarity among workers' organizations. Therefore, in recent years, many trade unions have put forward the demand of "unifying our strength," and individual trade unions and local organizations have actually begun consultations on mergers. This situation has forced the upper-level leaders of the two largest trade unions in the United States to seriously consider the issue of merger.

    In early December last year, the American Federation of Labor and the Congress of Industrial Organizations, which had been split for 20 years, formally announced their merger into a united trade union, named the "American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations," abbreviated as "AFL-CIO." Through this merger, more than 140 national trade unions joined this new trade union organization, which has about 15.54 million members, accounting for about 88% of the total number of workers in the United States who participate in trade union organizations. This is the largest trade union organization in the capitalist world.

    The merger of the AFL and the CIO is a major event of historical significance in the American workers' movement. It ended the state of division between the two major forces within the American workers' movement for 20 years, marking a new stage in the unified movement of the American working class. After the organized strength of the American working class is strengthened in this way, it will inevitably be able to greatly enhance its strength in the struggle against the attacks of monopoly capital.

    At present, there are still many independent trade unions outside the "AFL-CIO," with a total of about 2 million members. These include various railway workers' trade unions led by right-wing or middle-of-the-road figures, the United Mine Workers of America, the International Longshoremen's Association, and more than a dozen trade unions that were expelled from the CIO in 1949-50 and led by progressive forces, such as the International Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers, and the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America. Since the merger of the AFL and the CIO, these independent trade unions have also been considering merging with the "AFL-CIO." For example, in June this year, the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen and the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen negotiated with the leaders of the "AFL-CIO" to join the "AFL-CIO." The International Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers and the United Steelworkers of America, which belongs to the "AFL-CIO," jointly announced in May this year that they were "exploring" the possibility of a merger, beginning to change the situation of confrontation between the two trade unions in the past seven years.

    With the merger of the AFL and the CIO, the solidarity between black and white workers has also been strengthened. Two black labor leaders, Randolph and Thompson, were elected as vice presidents of the "AFL-CIO" Executive Committee, reflecting the development of the black labor movement and the strengthening of solidarity between black and white workers. In the United States, this is the first time that blacks have participated in the leadership of a national trade union federation. At present, there are 2 million organized black workers in the United States, and black workers are playing an increasingly important role in the American workers' movement.

    Strengthening Independent Political Action
    The merger of the AFL and the CIO has also promoted the independent political action of the American working class. At the request of the broad masses of workers, the "AFL-CIO" submitted a series of legislative proposals to Congress in April this year concerning improving workers' welfare and protecting civil rights. Trade union organizations in many industries have sent an unprecedented number of representatives to Washington to conduct vigorous activities to visit members of Congress, demanding that Congress take measures to realize the demands of the broad working people. In addition, many trade unions are launching movements to defend trade union rights. The "AFL-CIO" has also called for a struggle against the McClelland and Smith anti-union laws. The United Automobile Workers, the Building and Construction Trades Department, the International Union of Electrical Workers, and the Railway Labor Executives' Association have all issued statements protesting the U.S. authorities' further restrictions on trade union rights.

    This year is the U.S. presidential election year, and many trade unions are actively acting to play a greater political role in this election year. At the end of last year, the founding conference of the "AFL-CIO" decided to pursue a more active policy of independent political action in the 1956 election campaign, focusing on issues such as abolishing the "Taft-Hartley Act," the "right to work" laws and other anti-labor legislations, reducing high war taxes, and opposing racial discrimination and lynching laws, and carrying out vigorous political activities. This year, the political education committee of the "AFL-CIO" also held a meeting in Washington, calling on local organizations to quickly establish political action committees in congressional districts, states, counties, and cities to mobilize the masses to care about and participate in elections. At present, many local trade unions have launched activities according to these decisions. For example, the local organization of the CIO in Michigan has held many mass meetings in congressional districts and announced the establishment of campaign organizations at the meetings. In April this year, the United Automobile Workers, which has 1.5 million members, held a conference in Washington with 3,000 delegates participating to discuss political issues related to the election. The president of this trade union, Reuther, criticized the Republican government for favoring big business at the meeting and called on the trade union to "collectively" warn the Democratic Party that the trade union will not unconditionally support the Democratic Party this year as it has in the past. American newspapers pointed out that this is the first time in American history that trade unions have participated in election activities on such a large scale.

    Striving for a Grand Alliance of Labor Democracy
    Although the merger of the AFL and the CIO has opened up a situation of reunification of American workers' organizations and strengthened the ranks of organized labor, most of the labor force has not been organized, and some trade unions are still excluded from the "AFL-CIO" organization. The "AFL-CIO" itself also has considerable shortcomings, such as the lack of a progressive program, and the articles of association lack democracy, with the power mainly controlled by a few right-wing leaders of the original AFL, such as President Meany. Their anti-communist prejudice and support for the U.S. government's Cold War policy hinder the progressive role of the American labor movement. Overcoming these shortcomings of the labor movement and the "AFL-CIO," and forming a grand alliance of national labor on the basis of democracy and progress, still requires continued efforts.

    Dennis, General Secretary of the Communist Party of the United States, has pointed out that in the two key areas of striving for peace and opposing racial discrimination, labor's independent political activities are far behind the needs and possibilities of the situation. This is a major weakness of the American labor political movement. The progressive labor forces in the United States believe that changing this situation and closely combining the labor movement with the peace movement and the black movement for equal rights is an important task for the American labor movement at present.

    美国工人运动现况
    陆果木
    垄断资本猖狂进攻
    美国垄断资本为了追求最大限度的利润，正在猖狂地进攻美国工人阶级，一方面加紧残酷的剥削，另一方面肆行横暴的迫害。
    垄断企业普遍采用“赶快制度”和“自动化操作”，大大提高了工人的劳动强度。这增加了公司的利润。对于工人来说，结果却是许多人失掉了职业，有的只能找到部分工作。在业的工人，为要挣得过得去的工资，不得不加班加点，结果造成过度的疲劳，工伤事故十分严重。据官方统计，去年一年因工死亡的有一万四千多人，受伤的约一百九十一万人。虽然某些企业由于工人们英勇地进行了斗争，工资略微有些增加，然而生活费不断高涨，很快地就抵销了这一点增加。美国垄断资本还用失业的威胁来强迫工人增加劳动强度和压低工资。美国垄断资本集团的“巴隆氏”周刊甚至公然说：“督促工人们完成每天生产定额的唯一办法，就是用饥饿来威胁他们的孩子”。
    和这同时，美国垄断资本通过政府当局对工人阶级进行各种迫害。为了进一步摧残工人的基本权利，美国国会今年又一连通过了十多项直接用来反对工会的立法。这些立法都规定了政府有权以所谓“共产党渗入”的借口宣布任何工会非法，资本家有权以类似的借口任意开除工人。根据这些反动立法，美国劳工关系局曾经宣布美国的国际毛皮工人工会为“非法”，并将该工会的副主席伊尔文·鲍达希放逐出国。迄今，美国已有几百个进步的工会领袖受到审讯，他们都是这些反动立法的受害者。此外，垄断资本还直接派遣特务打手来破坏罢工、谋害工会领袖。例如，煤矿工人工会的活动分子查理·维密隆就是被肯塔基州克勒伊镇的反动当局这样杀害的。
    工人阶级顽强斗争
    面对着垄断资本日益猖狂的进攻，英勇的美国工人阶级也正在不屈不挠地进行斗争。
    罢工是目前美国工人反对垄断资本的一个主要斗争形式。根据美国劳工部的统计，1955年美国一共发生了四千二百次罢工，参加罢工的工人有二百七十五万人，其中有二十六次是十万人以上参加的大规模罢工。今年1月至5月，美国也曾发生了一千七百五十次罢工，有七十三万工人参加。7月1日，美国钢铁工人开始了六十五万人参加的大罢工，经过五个星期的斗争，资本家终于被迫答应增加工资，罢工才告结束。这些罢工，主要都是为了增加工资和改善劳动条件，反对资本家增加劳动强度及大批解雇工人。
    面对资本家和政府的种种威胁和迫害，工人们在罢工中都表现了顽强的战斗精神。如1955年10月开始的威斯汀豪斯电气公司五万多工人的罢工，曾坚持了一百五十六天。这是美国二十多年来有数万工人参加的历时最久的一次罢工。去年在华盛顿举行的三千名电车和公共汽车司机的罢工，也曾坚持了五十三天。新英格兰一万两千名纺织工人的罢工坚持了几个月。甚至在工人运动基础比较薄弱的南方，一些罢工也坚持了数月之久。
    劳工统一运动的新阶段
    美国工人阶级在反对垄断资本进攻的实际斗争中，日益认识到工人组织的统一和团结的重要。因而，近年来，许多工会纷纷提出“统一我们的力量”的要求，而且个别工会和地方组织实际上还开始了关于合并的协商。这一情况使得美国两个最大工会的上层领导不得不认真考虑合并问题。
    去年12月初，分裂了二十年的美国劳工联合会和产业工会联合会正式宣布合并为一个联合工会，名为“美国劳工联合会和产业工会联合会”，简称“劳联—产联”。通过这次合并，共有一百四十多个全国性的工会参加到这个新的工会联合组织中来，它拥有约一千五百四十万名会员，占美国全国参加工会组织的工人总数的88％左右。这是资本主义世界里最大的工会组织。
    劳联和产联的合并，乃是美国工人运动的一件具有历史意义的大事。它结束了二十年来美国工人运动内部两大队伍分裂的状态，标志着美国工人阶级统一运动进入了一个新阶段。美国工人阶级有组织的力量在这样加强了统一之后，必然能在反对垄断资本进攻的斗争中，大大增强自己的力量。
    目前，在“劳联—产联”以外，尚有许多独立的工会，他们的会员总共有二百万人左右。包括由右翼或中间分子领导的各铁路工人工会、联合煤矿工人工会及国际码头工人协会和在1949—50年间被产联开除的、由进步力量领导的国际开采、冶炼工人工会、联合电气工人工会等十余个工会。自从劳联和产联合并后，这些独立的工会也纷纷在考虑和“劳联—产联”合并。例如，今年6月间铁路列车员兄弟会和机车司炉、司机兄弟会曾与“劳联—产联”领导人谈判参加“劳联—产联”。国际开采、冶炼工人工会曾在今年5月间与属于“劳联—产联”的美国联合钢铁工人工会联合宣布他们正在“探求”合并的可能性，开始改变过去七年间这两个工会对立的情况。
    随着劳联和产联的合并，黑人和白人工人间的团结也增强了。两个黑人工人领袖——伦道夫和汤德逊当选为“劳联—产联”执行委员会副主席，这反映了黑人劳工运动的发展，也反映了黑白工人群众间团结的加强。在美国，黑人参加全国性工会联合会的领导机构，这还是第一次。目前美国有组织的黑人工人已达二百万名，黑人工人在美国工人运动中愈来愈起重要作用了。
    加强独立的政治行动
    劳联和产联的合并也促进了美国工人阶级独立的政治行动。在广大工人群众的要求下，“劳联—产联”曾于今年4月向国会提出了一系列有关改善工人福利和保障公民权利的立法主张。许多行业的工会组织曾派出人数空前多的代表，到华盛顿进行强有力的访问国会议员的活动，要求国会采取措施，以实现广大劳动人民的要求。此外，许多工会正在发动保卫工会权利的运动。“劳联—产联”也曾号召开展反对麦克利兰和史密斯反工会法的斗争。联合汽车工人工会、建筑工人工会、电气工人工会、铁路工人执行协会都先后发表了声明，抗议美国当局进一步限制工会权利的措施。
    今年是美国总统选举年，许多工会都在积极行动，争取在这个大选年中发挥更大的政治作用。去年年底，“劳联—产联”成立大会上曾经决定，在1956年竞选运动中奉行一种更积极的独立政治行动的政策，围绕着取消“塔夫脱—哈特莱法”、“工作权利法”等反劳工立法、减低高额的战争赋税、反对种族歧视和私刑法律等问题，展开强有力的政治活动。今年“劳联—产联”的政治教育委员会又曾在华盛顿举行会议，号召各地方组织迅速在国会选区、州、县和市成立政治行动委员会，发动群众关心和参加选举。目前许多地方的工会已经根据这些决定展开了活动。例如，产联在密执安州的地方组织，已在国会选区举行了多次群众大会，并在会上宣布成立竞选组织。今年四月，拥有一百五十万会员的联合汽车工人工会曾在华盛顿举行了一个有三千名代表参加的大会，讨论同选举有关的政治问题。这个工会的主席路德在会上抨击共和党政府袒护大企业，并且号召工会“集体”警告民主党：工会今年将不会像过去那样无条件地支持民主党。美国报纸指出：在美国历史上，工会这样大规模地参加选举活动，这是第一次。
    争取劳工民主大联合
    劳联和产联的合并，虽已打开了美国工人组织重新统一的局面，加强了有组织劳工的队伍，但是，还有大多数的劳工没有被组织起来，而且有一些工会迄今仍被排斥在“劳联—产联”组织之外。“劳联—产联”本身也还存在着不小的缺点，如没有一个进步的纲领，组织章程又缺乏民主，大权主要操在主席米尼等少数原劳联的右翼领袖手中，他们的反共成见和对美国政府冷战政策的支持，妨碍美国劳工运动发挥进步的作用。克服劳工运动和
  “劳联—产联”的这些缺点，在民主和进步的基础上，组成全国劳工的大联合，还有待于继续的努力。
    美国共产党总书记丹尼斯已经指出：在争取和平和反对种族歧视这两个关键方面，劳工独立政治活动还远远落后于情况的需要和可能。这是美国劳工政治运动的重大弱点。美国进步的劳工力量认为，改变这种状况，把劳工运动同和平运动和黑人争取平等权利的运动紧密结合起来，是美国劳工运动当前的一项重要任务。
