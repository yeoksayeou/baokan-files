The Ministry of Education and the Chinese Education Union today jointly issued a notice regarding the launch of an advanced worker movement in primary, secondary, and teacher training schools.

The notice stated that in recent months, some regions have launched the advanced worker movement in some schools. In some schools, the movement has been carried out well; in others, the movement has not been carried out well. Schools where the movement has been carried out well have seen positive results in promoting the enthusiasm of teachers and relying on the masses to improve work. Schools where the movement has not been carried out well have experienced tension, chaos, and a tendency towards formalism, hindering the normal progress of educational work.

The notice pointed out that since launching the advanced worker movement in schools is a new endeavor, and there are different opinions in various aspects, careful research is needed, and instructions from the Central Committee should be requested. Before the Central Committee issues instructions, the following measures will be taken temporarily in various regions:

	(1) Schools that have not yet launched the advanced worker movement will temporarily not launch this movement; however, they must adopt the working method of the mass line of relying on the masses to run schools well, and fully promote the socialist enthusiasm that has already risen among educators.

	(2) Schools where the advanced worker movement has been carried out well can continue to proceed; however, they must, in accordance with the characteristics of the school, effectively transform some of the rush activities into regular activities.

	(3) Schools where the advanced worker movement has not been carried out well and has already experienced significant deviations and chaos can stop the movement, correct the deviations that have occurred in the movement, so that the school's work can proceed normally, and so that the enthusiasm of teachers will not suffer setbacks and will be improved.

    教育部、教育工会发出通知
    在中、小学和师范学校开展先进工作者运动
    新华社讯　教育部、中国教育工会今天发出关于在中、小学和师范学校开展先进工作者运动问题的联合通知。
    通知说，近几个月来，某些地区在部分学校中开展了先进工作者运动。有的学校，运动开展得较好；有的学校，运动开展得不好。运动开展得好的学校，在发扬教师的积极性、依靠群众改进工作上，收到了效果；运动开展得不好的学校，发生了紧张、忙乱和形式主义的偏向，妨害正常教育工作的进行。
    通知指出，由于在学校中开展先进工作者运动是一件新的工作，各方面也存在着不同的意见，因此需要作慎重的研究并请示中央决定，在中央未作指示前，各地暂作如下的措施：
    （一）凡未开展先进工作者运动的学校，暂不开展这一运动；但必须采取依靠群众办好学校的群众路线的工作方法，充分发扬教育工作者中间已经高涨起来的社会主义积极性。
    （二）先进工作者运动开展得较好的学校，可以继续进行；但必须按照学校的特点，把一些突击性活动切实转入经常化。
    （三）先进工作者运动开展得不好、已经发生较大偏向和混乱现象的学校，可以停止进行，并纠正运动中已发生的偏向，使学校工作能正常地进行，使教师的积极性不致遭受挫折并得到提高。
