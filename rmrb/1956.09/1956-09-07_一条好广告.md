    A Good Advertisement
    The advertisement for sewing machines in the People's Daily on August 24th was very novel in form. As soon as I saw the title – “Little Bao’s Mother Wants to Buy a Model 15-201 New Sewing Machine” – I was attracted to it. This advertisement, through the dialogue between two people, very naturally introduced the advantages of the new sewing machine. It is a good advertisement with rich content.

    一条好广告
    人民日报8月24日的一条关于缝纫机的广告，形式很新颖。我一看题目——“小宝的妈妈想买一部15—201新型缝纫机”，就被它吸引住了。这条广告，通过两个人的对话，很自然地介绍了新型缝纫机的优点，是一篇内容丰富的好广告。
