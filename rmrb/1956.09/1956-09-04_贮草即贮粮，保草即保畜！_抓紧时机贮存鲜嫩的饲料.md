Gansu Province
	In the Wu都 (Wudu), 天水 (Tianshui), and other prefectures of Gansu Province where autumn crops mature earlier, agricultural production cooperatives are for the first time this year using green corn stalks, potato vines, radish leaves, soybean vines, green oats, etc., to make silage. Many places are also harvesting alfalfa and green grass to make silage. It is estimated that in the coming winter and spring, millions of livestock in Gansu Province will be able to eat fresh, fragrant silage.
Sichuan Province
	Sichuan Province has a mild climate and produces a lot of green fodder every year. Sweet potato vines alone yield more than 40 billion catties a year. However, the production season for green fodder is very uneven, with most of it concentrated in the autumn. In the past, farmers mostly did not have the habit of making silage, and often dried sweet potato vines and other things for preservation, or burned them as firewood. Therefore, pigs and cattle rarely have access to green fodder in winter and between spring and summer. Last year, some agricultural cooperatives tried to store some green fodder in cellars, and the effect was very good. Therefore, the Sichuan Provincial Department of Agriculture decided to promote the silage method throughout the province this autumn.
Shandong Province
	The leading organs in various parts of the Liaocheng area of Shandong Province have learned the lessons from the great difficulties in production caused by the lack of fodder last winter and this spring, and have adopted a positive and proactive attitude towards the work of silage. Even before the spring corn matured, the counties took the initiative to make plans and arrangements. Because silage is a new technical job, all localities have paid special attention to the technical preparations. In order to strengthen the guidance of silage technology in various places, the Liaocheng Prefectural Office also convened a meeting of animal husbandry cadres and some agricultural cooperative directors from all counties in the district in mid-August to conduct a special study.
	According to the plan, the Liaocheng area will silage nearly one billion catties of corn stalks this autumn, which can feed about 700,000 livestock in the area for more than a month. If the silage of sweet potato vines and peanut vines are added, the fodder problem in the coming spring will be largely solved.
Liaoning Province
	In order to solve the difficulty of insufficient livestock fodder next year, agricultural cooperatives in various parts of Liaoning Province are seizing the current opportunity of rampant wild grass to actively carry out silage activities. Recently, according to statistics from Gaiping, Haicheng, Taian, Faku, Xinmin and other counties alone, more than 26 million catties of grass have been harvested. Agricultural cooperatives in various places are also actively preparing for the silage of corn stalks, wild grass, and lime-alkalized straw. Some agricultural cooperatives in Haicheng County have already dug more than 80 silage cellars. According to the plan, agricultural cooperatives throughout the province will dig 100,000 silage cellars and silage 1 billion catties of fodder this year.
	Livestock fodder in Liaoning Province has been insufficient for years. This year, because many agricultural cooperatives have expanded the planting area of high-yield crops, the crops such as millet, which stalks are used as fodder, have been greatly reduced; in addition, the area of reclamation and afforestation has increased, and the source of grass has also been affected. Therefore, the shortage of livestock fodder next year will be more serious. In order to solve this problem, the Provincial Department of Agriculture convened a meeting of animal husbandry cadres from various cities and counties in mid-August to make specific arrangements for the work of harvesting and silage fodder. At present, the activity of storing fodder is being carried out in depth in the rural areas of the province.
Henan Province
	Henan Province had a lot of rain this summer, and the loss of wheat straw and wheat bran that were rained and soaked and then mildewed was quite large in most parts of the province. In this way, the phenomenon of grass shortage for livestock throughout the province is very serious.
	In response to this situation, the Henan Provincial People's Committee issued a notice to all localities on August 25 to seize the current favorable opportunity to carry out a fodder storage campaign. The Provincial Department of Agriculture has specially formulated a plan on vigorously carrying out the work of fodder storage and protection. The agricultural technology promotion stations in various places, in cooperation with the Communist Youth League organizations, have carefully summarized and promoted the old experiences of farmers in various places in storing and protecting fodder. Many regions have also put forward the slogan "Storing grass is storing grain, protecting grass is like protecting livestock".
	Now, the fodder silage campaign has been rapidly launched in many areas. Shangqiu Prefecture has taken measures such as digging cellars and burying them while harvesting early autumn crops, and has ensiled more than 100 million catties of corn stalks. 1,560 youth shock teams and groups in Xixian County, combined with weeding in the fields, had pulled more than 4 million catties of green grass and 1.03 million catties of dried grass by mid-August. Many agricultural cooperatives in Yuanyang County re-stacked, turned, dried, and re-rolled the moldy wheat straw and wheat bran, and properly stored all of them that could be used as feed.
	Farmers in thirteen mountainous townships in Tangyin County, in addition to storing enough livestock fodder for themselves, also plan to store 26,000 catties of fodder for farmers in disaster areas. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

### “贮草即贮粮，保草即保畜！”  抓紧时机贮存鲜嫩的饲料

    “贮草即贮粮，保草即保畜！”
    抓紧时机贮存鲜嫩的饲料
    甘肃省
    甘肃省武都、天水等秋庄稼成熟较早的专区，各农业生产合作社今年首次利用青绿的玉米秆、马铃薯蔓、萝卜叶、黄豆蔓、青燕麦等制作青贮饲料。很多地方还收割苜蓿、青草等用来制作青贮饲料。估计在今冬明春甘肃省将有几百万头牲畜可以吃到鲜嫩、芳香的青贮饲料。
    四川省
    四川省气候温和，每年所产青饲料很多。单是甘薯藤，一年的产量就在四百亿斤以上。但是，青饲料的生产季节很不平衡，大部集中在秋季。过去农民大多没有作青贮饲料的习惯，而往往是把甘薯藤等晒干后保存，或把它们当柴烧了。因此，每到冬季和春、夏之间，猪、牛很少能吃到青饲料。去年有些地方的农业社试着窖藏了一些青饲料，效果很好。因此，四川省农业厅决定今年秋季在全省范围内推广青贮法。
    山东省
    山东聊城地区各地领导机关接受去冬今春因饲料缺乏使生产遭受很大困难的教训，对青贮饲料的工作，都采取了积极主动的态度。还在春玉米成熟之前，各县就主动订出计划，作了安排。由于青贮饲料是一项带有技术性的新工作，各地特别抓紧了技术方面的准备。聊城专署为了加强对各地青贮技术的指导，还在8月中旬召开了全区各县畜牧干部和部分农业社主任会议，专门进行了研究。
    按照计划，聊城全区今秋将青贮玉米秸近十亿斤，可供全区七十万头左右牲口吃一个多月。如果再加上青贮的甘薯秧和花生秧等，就在很大程度上解决了明春的饲料问题。
    辽宁省
    为了解决明年牲畜饲草不足的困难，辽宁省各地农业社正抓紧目前野草丛生的时机，积极开展青贮饲草的活动。最近，仅据盖平、海城、台安、法库、新民等县的统计，就已收割草两千六百多万斤。各地农业社还积极进行青贮玉米秸、野草和稻草石灰碱化的准备工作。海城县部分农业社已经挖好青贮窖八十多个。根据计划，今年全省各地农业社将挖青贮窖十万个，青贮饲草十亿斤。
    辽宁省牲畜饲草历年不足。今年，由于许多农业社扩大了高产作物的种植面积，秸秆要作饲草的谷子等作物大大减少；又加开荒、造林面积增大，草源也受了影响，因此，明年牲畜饲草不足的情况将更加严重。为了解决这个问题，8月中旬，省农业厅召开了各市、县畜牧干部会议，对收割、青贮饲草的工作，又进行了具体的布置。目前，贮备饲草的活动正在全省农村深入展开。
    河南省
    河南省今年夏季多雨，全省大部地区的麦秸、麦糠遭受雨淋、水泡后霉烂变质的损失相当大。这样，全省牲畜缺草的现象就很严重。
    针对这种情况，河南省人民委员会在8月25日已通知各地抓紧当前有利时机，开展储备饲草运动。省农业厅专门制定了关于大力开展贮草保草工作的方案。各地农业技术推广站配合青年团组织，认真总结与推广了各地农民旧有的贮草保草经验。不少地区还提出了“贮草即贮粮，保草如保畜”的行动口号。
    现在，许多地区饲草青贮运动已经迅速开展起来。商丘专区在收割早秋作物的同时，采取挖窖埋藏等办法，已青贮玉米秆一亿多斤。息县全县一千五百六十个青年突击队、组，结合拔除田间杂草，截至8月中旬共拔青草四百多万斤，晒干草一百零三万斤。原阳县许多农业社把发霉了的麦秸、麦糠，重新倒垛、翻晒和重碾，对其中可以用来作饲料的都妥善加以保管。
    汤阴县十三个山区乡的农民，除自己储备了足够的牲畜饲草外，还计划要为灾区的农民储备饲草二万六千斤。　　　　　（据新华社讯）
