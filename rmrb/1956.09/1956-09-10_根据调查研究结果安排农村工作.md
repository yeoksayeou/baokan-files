Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 9th: Xinhua News Agency reporters Ai Yun, Cao Xuehuang, and Chen Yuming report: The Shandong Provincial leading organs are currently starting to overcome the subjectivist work style in their leadership work, based on the spirit of the resolution of the First Congress of the Chinese Communist Party Shandong Provincial Committee, starting with strengthening investigation and research, and studying and arranging the work for the autumn and winter seasons of this year based on the investigation results.
    The cadres dispatched by the Rural Work Department of the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, who have set up six work bases in various places, are currently conducting in-depth investigations into the new situations and changes in rural areas after the realization of cooperation, and studying how to arrange various economic and political tasks in rural areas in the future according to these new situations and changes. Before July, the Party and government leading organs in various places had required the universal merging of large cooperatives in the autumn and winter seasons of this year. After the Rural Work Department conducted in-depth investigation and research through various bases, it was found that most cooperative members and cooperative cadres were unwilling to run large cooperatives. They were worried that it would be difficult to run large cooperatives well and requested to concentrate their efforts on running the existing cooperatives well and improving production. Based on the results of investigation and research, the Rural Work Department believes that before the implementation of mechanized farming, the relations of production and productive forces of the advanced cooperatives with general scale are compatible. They should be stabilized at the current scale for a period of time in order to concentrate all forces on developing agricultural production. Therefore, when the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party deployed the task of cooperation in the autumn and winter seasons of this year, it determined that most advanced cooperatives could remain stable so as to concentrate on completing the task of advancement, and use sufficient time to fully develop production and do a good job in the rectification and consolidation of existing cooperatives.
    In the work of farmland water conservancy construction in the spring of this year, some places in Shandong Province had blindly pursued quantity without proceeding from reality, resulting in the waste of labor and funds of agricultural production cooperatives, and many abandoned wells were dug. Recently, the Shandong Provincial Water Conservancy Department has investigated the water conservancy work of more than 30 agricultural production cooperatives and learned about the conditions of labor and funds that agricultural production cooperatives may use for water conservancy construction in the future. After investigation, it was clarified that in the autumn and winter seasons of this year, the general emphasis should not be on increasing the number of new wells, but should first focus on consolidating and improving the quality of existing wells, giving full play to the effectiveness of the wells, improving irrigation technology, and expanding the irrigated area, and then increasing the necessary number of new wells according to actual needs and quality standards.
    After the conclusion of the Party Congress, the Shandong Provincial Department of Commerce organized three groups led by responsible cadres such as the director, to investigate and study the market characteristics of various regions in grain-producing areas, cotton-producing areas, and peanut-producing areas, and has initially deployed the supply of goods for the peak season after autumn based on the investigation results. The Shandong Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative has also increased the supply plan for household appliances for farmers based on the investigation materials of the purchasing power of 68 agricultural production cooperatives.
    In order to make the work plan practical and reliable and avoid subjectivism, the Shandong Provincial Water Conservancy Department and the Supply and Marketing Cooperative also changed the past method of formulating plans from top to bottom, and adopted the method of first formulating the plan from below, and then having the leading organs review and approve it based on the investigation materials. The Water Conservancy Department is also summarizing the typical experience of how to conduct investigation and research and formulate plans based on reality, in order to guide various places to improve the work of formulating plans.
    In order to improve their political and ideological level and overcome the subjectivist and bureaucratic work styles in their work, cadres above the intermediate level in various provincial-level leading organs in Shandong Province have begun to study five documents from the beginning of September: "Reform Our Study," "Rectify the Party's Style of Work," "Oppose the Party's Eight-Legged Essay," "Resolution on Certain Questions in the History of Our Party," and "On the Historical Experience of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat." Through study, they will combine the examination of these harmful ideological styles existing in practical work and study how to improve their work.

    山东省级领导机关着手克服工作中的主观主义作风
    根据调查研究结果安排农村工作
    听取农业社干部和社员的意见，改变今年秋冬两季普遍并大社的计划；
    了解水利和市场情况后，对打井和物资供应工作作了新的部署。
    新华社济南9日电　新华社记者艾蕴、曹学璜、陈雨明报道：山东省的省级领导机关目前正在根据中共山东省第一次代表大会的决议精神，从加强调查研究着手克服领导工作中的主观主义作风，并根据调查结果研究和安排今年秋冬两季的工作。
    中共山东省委员会农村工作部派出干部在各地设置的六个工作基点，目前正在深入调查农村在实现合作化以后的新情况和新变化，研究怎样根据这些新情况和新变化安排今后农村的各项经济工作和政治工作。在7月份以前，各地的党政领导机关曾要求在今年秋冬两季普遍并大社。农村工作部通过各个基点进行深入调查研究以后，发现多数社员和合作社干部并不愿意办大社，他们担心社大了不容易办好，而要求集中力量办好现有的社，搞好生产。农村工作部根据调查研究的结果，认为在实行机械耕作以前，目前具有一般规模的高级社的生产关系和生产力是相适应的，应当在现有的规模上稳定一个时期，以集中一切力量发展农业生产。因此，中共山东省委员会在部署今年秋冬两季的合作化任务时，便确定大多数高级社可以稳定不动，以便集中精力完成高级化的任务，并用充分的时间全力发展生产和做好现有社的整顿和巩固工作。
    在今年春季兴修农田水利的工作中，山东省有些地方曾经发生不从实际出发、盲目贪多的现象，以致浪费了农业生产合作社的劳力和资金，并且打了许多废井。最近山东省水利厅分别调查了三十多个农业生产合作社开展水利工作的情况，了解了农业生产合作社今后可能用于兴修水利的劳力和资金的条件。经过调查，明确了在今年秋冬两季不应一般地强调增打新井，而应当首先以巩固和提高现有水井质量，充分发挥水井效能，改进灌溉技术，扩大浇地面积为主，然后再根据实际需要，按照质量标准的要求，增打必要数量的新井。
    山东省商业厅在党代表大会结束以后，组织了由厅长等负责干部带领的三个组，分别到粮产区、棉产区和花生产区调查研究了各类不同地区的市场特点，并已根据调查结果初步布置了秋后旺季的物资供应工作。山东省供销合作社也根据六十八个农业生产合作社的购买力情况的调查材料，增订了农户家庭用具的供应计划。
    为了使工作计划订得切实可靠，避免主观主义，山东省水利厅和供销合作社还改变了过去那种自上而下制定计划的方法，而采取先由下面制定，然后由领导机关根据调查材料加以审查核定的方法。水利厅还正在总结如何进行调查研究、从实际出发制定计划的典型经验，以指导各地改进制定计划的工作。
    山东省各个省级领导机关中的中级以上干部，为了提高政治思想水平和克服工作中的主观主义、官僚主义作风，已经从9月初开始学习“改造我们的学习”、“整顿党的作风”、“反对党八股”、“关于若干历史问题的决议”和“关于无产阶级专政的历史经验”等五个文件，并将通过学习，结合检查在实际工作中存在的这些有害的思想作风，和研究改进工作。
