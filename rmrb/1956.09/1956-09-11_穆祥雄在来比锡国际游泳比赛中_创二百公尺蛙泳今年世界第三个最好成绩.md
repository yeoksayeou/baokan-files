Xinhua News Agency, Leipzig, 10th September - Chinese swimmer Mu Xiangxiong, on September 9th at the international swimming competition held here, created this year's third best world record in the 200m breaststroke - 2 minutes 36 seconds.

In the competition, Mu Xiangxiong defeated the famous West German athlete, Kleinschroth, and won first place. His result was 2.6 seconds faster than his previous best Chinese record he created in Warsaw on September 6th, and 6 seconds faster than the official Chinese record.

Mu Xiangxiong's result brings him even closer to the official world record.

The official world record for the men's 200m breaststroke was created by the famous Japanese athlete, Furukawa, last year, with a time of 2 minutes 33.7 seconds. However, this year, Furukawa has created the world's best result in this event twice. This August, during the swimming trials for the Japanese Olympic Games, he achieved a time of 2 minutes 35 seconds. On September 8th, he further surpassed his own official world record by half a second with a time of 2 minutes 33.2 seconds (the swimming pool length was fifty meters) at the Japanese University Swimming Competition.

Mu Xiangxiong's result is still 2.8 seconds behind Furukawa's best result.

The highest Olympic record for this event is 2 minutes 34.4 seconds, created by Australia's Davies in 1952.

    穆祥雄在来比锡国际游泳比赛中
    创二百公尺蛙泳今年世界第三个最好成绩
    据新华社来比锡10日电　中国游泳运动员穆祥雄9月9日在这里举行的国际游泳比赛中，创造了二百公尺蛙泳的今年世界第三个最好的成绩——2分36秒。
    穆祥雄在比赛中战胜西德的著名运动员科来因而获得了第一名。他的成绩比他9月6日在华沙所创造的中国最高成绩缩短了2.6秒，并且比中国正式纪录快了6秒钟。
    穆祥雄的这个成绩进一步接近了正式的世界纪录。
    男子二百公尺蛙泳的世界正式纪录是日本著名运动员古川在去年创造的，成绩是2分33.7秒。但是，今年以来，古川连续两次创造了这项运动的世界最好成绩。今年8月间，他在日本奥林匹克运动会游泳选拔赛时曾经达到了2分35秒的成绩。9月8日，他在日本大学生游泳比赛中又以2分33.2秒（比赛的游泳池长五十公尺）的成绩超过了他本人所保持的正式世界纪录半秒钟。
    穆祥雄的成绩比古川的最高成绩还差2.8秒。
    奥林匹克运动会这一项目的最高纪录是澳大利亚的戴维斯在1952年创造的2分34.4秒。
