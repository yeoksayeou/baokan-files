Xinhua News Agency, 8th Dispatch: Washington News: Due to the failure of the "Five-Nation Committee" representatives in the preliminary talks in Cairo to compel the Egyptian government to accept the "Dulles Plan," U.S. Secretary of State Dulles, on September 7th, held two "highly secret meetings with British and French diplomatic officials stationed in Washington within one day, to discuss the next steps to deal with the ‘delicate’ Suez Canal situation."

International News Service reported that the British Minister Coulson told Dulles during the meeting what actions Britain and France might take if the Cairo negotiations broke down. The news said that these actions might include the following: imposing strict economic sanctions on Egypt; agreeing to submit the issue to the United Nations; insisting on the use of force against Egypt; European navigators might withdraw from the canal.

Associated Press reported that U.S. Secretary of State Dulles was concerned, "but by no means disappointed," that the Cairo talks apparently had not found any solutions. The news also stated that Dulles believed that the Cairo talks had now concluded the first "ascertaining attitudes" stage and further negotiations must be conducted to determine whether the two opposing plans could be compromised.

According to Reuters, the U.S. representative to the Five-Nation Committee, Henderson, and the chairman of the committee, Menzies, separately reported on the situation of the Cairo talks to Dulles. At the same time, Dulles is maintaining close contact with Eisenhower on the matter.

    开罗初步谈判没有结果
    杜勒斯同英法大使密商新步骤
    据新华社8日讯　华盛顿消息：由于“五国委员会”代表在开罗初步会谈中未能迫使埃及政府接受“杜勒斯计划”，美国国务卿杜勒斯在9月7日一天内，同英、法两国驻华盛顿的外交官员举行了两次“非常秘密的会谈，讨论对付‘微妙的’苏彝士运河局势的下一步骤”。
    国际新闻社消息说，英国公使柯尔逊在会谈中告诉了杜勒斯如果开罗谈判破裂英法可能采取的行动。消息说，这些行动可能包括下列几个方面：对埃及实行严格的经济制裁；同意把这个问题提交联合国；坚持对埃及使用武力；欧洲籍领航员可能自运河撤退。
    美联社消息说，美国国务卿杜勒斯对于开罗会谈显然没有找到任何解决办法很关心，“但是决不是失望”。消息又说，杜勒斯认为开罗会谈现在已经结束了第一个“探明态度”的阶段，必须再进行谈判来断定两个敌对的计划是否可以折衷。
    据路透社报道说，参加五国委员会的美国代表汉德逊和这个委员会的主席孟席斯分别就开罗会谈的情况向杜勒斯提出了汇报。同时杜勒斯正在就这个问题同艾森豪威尔保持着密切联系。
