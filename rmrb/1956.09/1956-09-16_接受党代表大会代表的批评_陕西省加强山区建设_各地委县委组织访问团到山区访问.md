Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, September 15th: Shaanxi Province's provincial-level departments, based on the criticisms and suggestions made by delegates at the Second Shaanxi Provincial Party Congress and in accordance with the requirements of the Provincial Party Committee, have re-examined and revised their plans related to mountain area work, strengthening various aspects of construction in mountain areas.

The problem of transportation, which the people in the mountain areas are urgently requesting to be solved, is currently being addressed vigorously. This year, 20 simple highways are under construction or reconstruction in the Ba Mountains, Qin Mountains, and northern Shaanxi, with a total length of 1,500 kilometers. Currently, more than 500 kilometers of newly built or reconstructed simple highways, cart roads, and pack animal trails have been completed in the mountain areas of Shaanxi.

After the Provincial Party Congress concluded, the Provincial Health Department organized more than 700 teachers and students from doctors, nurses, and midwifery schools in the Xi'an area to conduct local disease surveys and health education in the Shangluo Special District in the Qin Mountains. At the same time, venereal disease prevention and treatment teams and traditional Chinese medicine mobile medical teams were organized to provide free treatment in the mountain areas. The Provincial Health Department has also recently formulated a new plan to reduce medical fees, which will be implemented soon.

To meet the demand of the masses in the mountain areas for their children to attend school, 17 new middle schools have been built in southern and northern Shaanxi this year. The work of building more primary schools in the mountain counties is also underway. The number of new students enrolled in these areas this year may increase by more than 200,000. In early September, the relevant leading departments of the province allocated more than one million yuan in additional primary school funding to the mountain counties.

Work on agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, and soil and water conservation is also being improved. After the Provincial Party Congress, the Agriculture Department held a special meeting to study the reasons for low wheat yields in the mountain areas, and formulated regulations for improving wheat cultivation techniques in mountain areas according to the characteristics of different regions. Currently, seven million jin of improved wheat varieties and a large number of pesticides and hillside plows are being transported to the mountain areas. The Agriculture Department also hired nine carpenters with rich experience in making plows to go to Yan'an, Suide, Hanzhong and other special districts to teach local farmers the techniques of making, modifying and using plows. At the same time, a batch of demonstration plows were manufactured and distributed free of charge to farmers in old revolutionary base areas and mountain areas, in order to promote the close planting of wheat in the old revolutionary base areas and mountain areas.

Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, September 15th: Mountain area visiting delegations and work groups organized by the local prefectural and county Party committees of the Chinese Communist Party in the vast mountain areas of Shaanxi Province have successively begun visiting the mountain areas since the beginning of September. Most of these visiting delegations and work groups are led by the prefectural Party committee secretaries or county Party committee secretaries. Twelve county Party committee secretaries and county heads from the seven counties of Shangluo Special District and more than 100 cadres have begun visiting households in twenty-four key townships. The activities of the various district Party committees and township branches in the mountain areas to visit key villages and agricultural cooperatives have also begun simultaneously.

This visit to the mountain areas was carried out in accordance with the instructions of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. After the Second Shaanxi Provincial Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, based on the criticisms and suggestions made by delegates from the vast mountain areas at the Congress, specifically discussed the work in the mountain areas, put forward specific measures to strengthen the construction of the mountain areas, and decided to establish a mountain area construction committee to uniformly guide and plan the work in the mountain areas. In August, the Provincial Party Committee also instructed Party organizations in the mountain areas throughout the province to assign cadres within September, with the cadres personally participating under the responsibility of Party organizations at all levels, to focus on in-depth visits to the mountain areas, and to complete the visits to the mountain areas throughout the province in batches within the year.

After arriving in the mountain areas, the visiting delegations and work groups talked with farmers from door to door, held small-scale discussion meetings to understand the situation and solicit opinions. The farmers sharply criticized the mountain Party organizations and the government for once relaxing their leadership over sideline production in the mountain areas, which reduced the income of the people in the mountain areas, as well as the untimely purchase and unreasonable prices of mountain goods and local products. They also raised many criticisms and suggestions on issues such as excessive fees and complicated procedures of health agencies, and too few schools.

    接受党代表大会代表的批评
    陕西省加强山区建设
    各地委县委组织访问团到山区访问
    据新华社西安15日电　陕西省省级各部门根据中共陕西省第二次代表大会上代表们提出的批评和建议，按照省委要求，已重新审核修订了有关山区工作的计划，加强山区的各项建设。
    山区人民迫切要求解决的交通运输问题，目前正在大力解决中。今年在巴山、秦岭和陕北已动工新建、改建的简易公路有二十条，长一千五百公里。目前，陕西山区新建改建的简易公路、大车道、驮运路已有五百多公里完工。
    省卫生厅在省党代表大会闭幕后，组织西安地区的医生、护士和助产学校的七百多名教师、学生，到秦岭上的商雒专区进行地方病调查和卫生宣传。同时又组织了性病防治队和中医巡回医疗队，赴山区进行免费治疗。省卫生厅最近还制定了降低医疗收费标准的新方案，这个新方案不久就可以实施。
    为满足山区群众子女入学的要求，今年陕南、陕北新建了十七所中学；山区各县增建小学的工作也正在进行。这些地区今年新入学的儿童大约可以增加二十多万名。9月初，省的有关领导部门已经把追加的一百多万元小学经费拨给山区各县。
    农业、林业、水利、水土保持等项工作也在改进中。省党代表大会结束以后，农业厅曾专门召开会议研究山区小麦低产原因，并按照不同地区特点，制定了改进山区小麦栽培技术规程。现在，供应山区的七百万斤小麦良种和大批药剂、山地犁等正在调运中。农业厅并雇请九名富有造耧经验的木工去延安、绥德、汉中等专区向当地农民传授造耧、改耧和使用技术，同时制造了一批示范耧，免费发给老区、山区农民，以推动老区、山区小麦的密植工作。
    新华社西安15日电　陕西省广大山区的中共各地委、县委组织的山区访问团和工作组，从9月初开始已陆续到山区进行访问。这些访问团和工作组大多是由地委书记或县委书记领导的。商雒专区七个县的十二名县委书记、县长和一百多名干部已经在二十四个重点乡内开始逐户访问。山区的各中共区委和乡支部访问重点村庄和农业社的活动，也同时展开。
    这次访问山区的活动是根据中共陕西省委员会指示进行的。中共陕西省委员会在中共陕西省第二次代表大会后，根据代表大会上来自广大山区的代表们提出的批评和建议，专门讨论了山区工作，提出了加强山区建设的具体措施，并决定成立山区建设委员会，统一指导与规划山区工作。8月间，省委又指示全省山区党组织在9月份内抽派干部，由各级党组织负责干部亲自参加，重点深入山区访问，在年内分批完成全省山区的访问工作。
    各地访问团、工作组到达山区后，挨门逐户和农民谈心，召开小型座谈会了解情况和征求意见。农民们对山区党组织和政府一度放松了对山区副业生产的领导，使山区人民减少收入以及对山货土产收购不及时、价格不合理等问题提出了尖锐批评。对卫生机关收费过高、手续繁杂，学校过少等问题也提出了不少批评和建议。
