　　After Two Years Since the Restoration of Peace
　　Great Achievements in Economic and Cultural Construction in Vietnam
　　(Dispatch from Hanoi) Over the past eleven years since the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, especially in the two years since the restoration of peace, great achievements have been made in economic and cultural construction.

　　Rapid Recovery and Development of Industrial Production

　　After the restoration of peace, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam vigorously restored factories and enterprises in the North and built many new factories. Industrial output in 1955 increased sevenfold compared to 1954. In the first half of this year, industrial output increased threefold compared to last year.

　　In terms of transportation, 650 kilometers of the 1,100 kilometers of railways in northern Vietnam that were damaged during the war have been repaired. Almost all highways have been repaired, and new highways have been built.

　　Grain Output Exceeds the Highest Pre-War Level

　　Thanks to the vigorous efforts of farmers in northern Vietnam to reclaim wasteland, build water conservancy projects, cultivate meticulously, and wage a tenacious struggle against various disasters, agricultural production has rapidly recovered. Grain output this summer increased by 40% compared to last year, exceeding the highest pre-war level. The total area planted with cotton in 1955 increased by 32% compared to the average pre-war planting area, and this year's planting area exceeded the area stipulated in the national plan by nearly 30%.

　　Forestry and animal husbandry have also achieved great success. The number of fir trees planted last year was double that of 1939. According to the national plan, the number of fir trees planted this year will increase tenfold compared to 1939. The timber harvested last year reached the normal pre-war level, and the amount of logging in the first half of this year exceeded the original plan by 3%. The total number of yellow cattle and buffalo in 1955 increased by 270,000 heads compared to 1939. By September of this year, the total number of yellow cattle and buffalo will increase by more than 8% compared to last year. The total number of pigs raised in 1955 reached 2.6 million.

　　Leapfrog Development of Cultural and Educational Undertakings

　　During the era of French colonial rule, 95% of the Vietnamese people were illiterate. In 1939, there were fewer than fifteen primary school students per thousand Vietnamese people, twenty-four junior high school students per hundred thousand people, and twenty-three high school students per million people. And the entire Indochina had only one university, which admitted only dozens of students each year. Over the past eleven years since the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, northern Vietnam has achieved a profound cultural revolution. To date, 11 million of the 13 million people in the North have escaped illiteracy. According to the national plan, the capital Hanoi will complete the task of eradicating illiteracy this year, and the entire northern Vietnam will also completely eliminate illiteracy within three years. In the first half of this year, northern Vietnam had a total of 4,100 middle and primary schools with 640,000 students. Compared with the highest year of student enrollment during the French rule, the number of middle school students has increased tenfold, and the number of primary school students has increased threefold. In the new school year starting from the end of September, the number of schools and students will greatly increase again. In the new school year, northern Vietnam will have five universities with 3,000 students, an increase of more than fourfold compared to the 1938-1939 school year.

    和平恢复后两年来
    越南经济文化建设成就巨大
    本报讯　河内消息：越南民主共和国成立十一年来，特别是和平恢复后两年多以来，在经济和文化建设已经获得了巨大的成就。
    工业生产迅速恢复发展
    和平恢复后，越南民主共和国大力地恢复北方的工厂企业，并建设了许多新的工厂。1955年的工业产量比1954年增加了七倍。今年上半年，工业产量又比去年增加了三倍。
    在交通运输方面，越南北方在战时遭到破坏的一千一百公里铁路已经有六百五十公里得到修复。差不多所有的公路都已修复，并且建筑了新的公路。
    谷物产量超过战前最高水平
    由于越南北方农民大力开垦荒地、兴修水利工程、精耕细作，并同各种灾害进行了顽强的斗争，农业生产已经迅速恢复。今年夏季的谷物产量比去年增加了40％，超过了战前的最高水平。1955年植棉的总面积较战前的平均植棉面积增加了32％，而今年植棉面积又超过了国家计划规定的面积的将近30％。
    林业和畜牧业也获得很大的成就。去年种植的枞树的数目等于1939年的两倍。按照国家计划规定，今年种植的枞树将比1939年增加十倍。去年采伐的木材已达到战前的常年水平，今年上半年伐木量已超过原计划的3％。1955年黄牛和水牛的总头数比1939年增加了二十七万头。到今年9月止，黄牛和水牛总头数又将比去年增加8％以上。1955年养猪的总头数达二百六十万头。
    文化教育事业飞跃发展
    在法国殖民者统治时代，95％的越南人民是文盲。在1939年，每一千个越南人中只有不到十五个小学生，每十万人中只有二十四个初中学生，每百万人中只有二十三个高中学生。而整个印度支那只有一所大学，它每年只收数十名学生。越南民主共和国成立十一年来，越南北方已经实现了深刻的文化革命。到目前为止，北方一千三百余万人中已有一千一百万人摆脱了文盲状态。按照国家计划，首都河内在今年要完成扫盲任务，整个越南北方在三年内也要完全扫除文盲。今年上半年越南北方共拥有中、小学四千一百所，学生六十四万人。同法国统治时代学生人数最高年度比较，中学生增加了十倍，小学生增加了三倍。在从9月底开始的新学年中，学校和学生的数目又将大大增加。在新的学年中，越南北方将拥有五所大学，学生人数将达三千名，比1938—1939学年的人数增加四倍以上。
