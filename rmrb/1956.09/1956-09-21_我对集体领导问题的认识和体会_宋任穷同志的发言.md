I fully agree with the political report made by Comrade Liu Shaoqi on behalf of the Party Central Committee, and I agree with the reports of Comrades Zhou Enlai and Deng Xiaoping. Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report is a historically significant document of our Party. It summarizes past experiences and is of extremely great significance for the construction of our country and the building of the Party in the future. In the eleven years from the Seventh National Congress to the Eighth National Congress, our Party, together with the people of the whole country, implemented the line put forward by the Seventh National Congress: "Boldly mobilize the masses, strengthen the people's forces, unite all forces that can be united, defeat the aggressors, and build a new China," overthrowing the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism, and establishing the People's Republic of China. After the nationwide victory, we victoriously carried out socialist construction and socialist transformation. All these great victories are due to our Party's creative application of Marxist-Leninist theory, mobilizing the strength of the people throughout the country, and achieving them through long-term arduous struggle.

Now, I will talk about my understanding of the issue of collective leadership and my experience in practical work.

    **健全党委制，发挥党委全体成员的作用**
    **Strengthening the Party Committee System and Giving Play to the Role of All Members of the Party Committee**

According to the historical materialist viewpoint that the people are the true creators of history, our Party adheres to democratic centralism and affirms the necessity of implementing the mass line in all work. Collective leadership is one of the fundamental issues of democratic centralism, and its essence is the application of the mass line in the Party's leadership work. Collective leadership is the opposite of patriarchal personal leadership. It is the most capable of bringing out the enthusiasm of the Party committee members, and it is also the most conducive to bringing out the enthusiasm of the people, concentrating the wisdom of the masses, and correctly guiding the people to victory. The Constitution of the Communist Party of China stipulates that any Party organization must strictly abide by the principle of collective leadership. The whole Party has always attached importance to this provision and conscientiously implemented it in its work, and has gained rich experience in this regard.

To ensure the Party's collective leadership, it is necessary to strengthen the Party committee system and give play to the role of all members of the Party committee. In September 1948, the Party Central Committee issued a decision on strengthening the Party committee system. In the process of implementing this decision by the Central Committee, the collective leadership of the Party was further strengthened. But it should also be seen that, at present, in some Party committees, especially in some Party committees below the level of the prefectural committee, due to the large number of cadres transferred in the previous period, the secretaries are generally older and the members are newer, and in addition, the democratic style of some leading comrades is insufficient, which easily reflects the past relationship between superiors and subordinates in the collective leadership of the Party committee. At the same time, due to the large number of rush campaigns in the past, the Party committee's tasks are heavy, and it is often entangled in routine affairs, unable to concentrate on seriously considering and discussing major issues, which limits the exertion of collective strength. According to our Party's experience, to strengthen collective leadership, it is necessary to fully promote democracy, strengthen the Party committee system, and give play to the initiative and creativity of each member. For each meeting, especially when solving major problems, thorough preparations must be made in advance, fully deliberated, relevant information must be provided to each other, different views must be exchanged, and full discussions must be held at the meeting. For dissenting opinions, if they are not urgent problems, there is no need to rush to make conclusions, so as to make decisions on the basis of ideological unity. The Party committee secretary has a major responsibility in collective leadership. He must maintain close contact with each member, communicate ideas frequently, be good at organizing everyone to study problems and offer ideas, give play to collective wisdom, and take the lead in promoting democracy and carrying out criticism and self-criticism. Every member of the Party committee should actively participate in collective leadership, care about overall work, exchange information, supplement each other, and put different opinions and problems on the table. In this way, it is possible to achieve unity of thought, unity of language, and joint efforts to do a good job. Just as Comrade Mao Zedong taught us in the conclusion of the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee in 1949, the secretary should be a good "squad leader" and carry out his work as harmoniously as playing the piano.

    **集体领导必须建立在群众路线的基础上**
    **Collective Leadership Must Be Based on the Mass Line**

According to our Party's experience, it is necessary to truly strengthen the Party committee system and strengthen collective leadership on the basis of implementing the mass line. Good collective leadership not only requires a sound collective leadership system, with major issues decided through collective discussion, but also must be good at relying on the masses, following the mass line, fully promoting democracy, and conscientiously reflecting and concentrating the opinions of the masses; not only consulting with the masses before things are decided, but also consulting with the masses during the implementation process, truly combining leadership with the masses, and achieving "from the masses, to the masses." This will ensure the correctness of our Party's leadership and avoid or reduce mistakes. Whenever this is done, the result is always good or relatively good; conversely, the result is always bad, and sometimes even causes errors.

Taking the agricultural cooperation and agricultural production increase movements that we are all familiar with as an example, it fully illustrates that collective leadership and the mass line are inseparable. In 1955, in China's agricultural cooperation movement, the Central Committee thoroughly criticized the right-leaning conservative ideology existing within the Party on this issue, and made the "Resolution on the Issue of Agricultural Cooperation." When implementing the policies and guidelines of the Party Central Committee, Party committees in various places not only conscientiously carried out collective discussions, but also conscientiously conducted investigation and research, understood the demands of the broad masses of peasants and the possibility of developing agricultural cooperatives, and closely combined the instructions of the Central Committee with the specific conditions of various places. This enabled the agricultural cooperation movement throughout the country to quickly form a climax, quickly basically realizing agricultural cooperation in a very short period of time and meeting the demands of the broad masses of peasants. However, in the subsequent agricultural production increase movement, when various places were formulating their own plans or programs based on the production increase targets set by the Central Committee, most areas implemented them relatively well, but there were also many areas that, due to a lack of investigation and research and a pragmatic style, did not humbly listen to the opinions of lower-level cadres and the masses, did not seriously study the conditions necessary for production increase and the measures that must be taken, and, starting from subjective wishes, blindly set excessively high production targets that were impossible to achieve, resulting in the need to revise them repeatedly and causing losses in some areas, making the leadership very passive.

This example shows that the same leadership group, the same leadership members, and the same meetings to discuss and make decisions, resulted in different results, one thing being done better and the other thing being done poorly. People will ask: Why does this phenomenon occur? Where is the key? I believe that the key lies in whether this leadership group has a clear, firm, and unwavering view that the mass line must be implemented in any work; whether it conscientiously conducts investigation and research, humbly listens to and concentrates the opinions of the masses, that is, whether it can truly combine collective leadership with the mass line. When I talked to several prefectural and municipal Party committee secretaries, they said that the agricultural cooperation movement was done relatively well because they conscientiously studied the instructions of the Central Committee, deeply mobilized the masses, and the masses pushed us; in the subsequent agricultural production increase movement, although we also studied the instructions of the Central Committee and held various meetings for discussion, because we did not grasp the actual possibility of increasing production, set the production increase targets too high, and put more effort into "persisting" with the masses in the implementation process and less effort into "concentrating" from the masses, problems arose. This shows that if one only generally pays attention to collective leadership, without paying attention to close integration with the mass line, one will inevitably become detached from reality and the masses. Therefore, it cannot be simply said that having the form of collective leadership can guarantee that the Party's leadership will not make major mistakes, and that having the form of collective leadership will solve all problems. Those leadership groups in our Party's history who made line errors also talked about collective leadership verbally, and major issues were often decided after meeting discussions, but they actually only had subjective collective leadership, not a pragmatic collective leadership based on the mass line, resulting in serious errors. It can be seen that the essence of the problem does not simply lie in whether there is the form of collective leadership, but in whether there is the substance of collective leadership, that is, whether collective leadership is based on the mass line. Collective leadership and the mass line are closely linked and inseparable. Only collective leadership based on the mass line is truly complete and reliable, and can continuously improve work and improve the level of leadership.

    **进行充分酝酿，重视少数人的意见**
    **Conducting Full Deliberation and Attaching Importance to the Opinions of a Minority**

In this regard, the leadership method of the Party Central Committee is worthy of the whole Party's learning. The Party Central Committee, for major national policy issues, as long as the situation permits, always launches as many comrades as possible to fully deliberate in advance. For example: the convening of the Seventh National Congress of the Party in 1945, the resolution on the issue of agricultural cooperation in 1955, the formulation of the "National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) from 1956 to 1967," the main documents of this conference, and many other major issues have all been fully deliberated. This tells us that when the Party committee decides on major issues, it must conduct full deliberation within the Party, fully reflect and concentrate the opinions of the masses, in order to make correct decisions. The simple method of writing a decision in a short period of time, or simply relying on administrative orders, cannot solve the problem.

In the process of deliberation and discussion, we should attach importance to the opinions of a minority. Some heads of Party organizations are often unwilling to listen to and consider the opinions of a minority, and even fear that someone will raise opposing opinions, which is wrong. A county Party committee secretary in Hebei Province told me that they had encountered a minority of people raising different opinions from the opposite side when discussing the purchase of grain and agricultural production increase issues, but the result was that the opinions of the minority were adopted, avoiding mistakes. When they discussed the agricultural production increase targets for 1956, the majority of the county Party committee members advocated increasing production to 600 jin per mu (more than 100% of the 290 jin increase per mu in 1955), only a few comrades disagreed. After repeatedly considering the opinions of the minority and studying typical investigation materials, they determined the production increase target to be 350 jin per mu. It was later proved that this was in line with reality. Such examples will be encountered in practical work. It is undeniable that, in general, the opinions of the majority are correct. But sometimes the opinions of a minority will also be correct. This is because these minority opinions, although seemingly a minority in the Party committee meeting, come from the masses and actually reflect the interests of the majority of the masses. It can be seen that there is nothing wrong with an opposing opinion being raised or retained. Even if this opposing opinion is wrong, it will help the leadership to repeatedly consider the problem from multiple perspectives, so that the Party's decision can avoid one-sidedness and errors to the greatest extent, and at the same time, it can make the Party more united.

    **民主和集中，集体领导和个人负责要结合起来**
    **Democracy and Centralization, Collective Leadership and Individual Responsibility Must Be Combined**

Fully promoting inner-Party democracy does not deny that the Party's leadership needs a high degree of centralization, but to dialectically combine the two, both to let go and promote democracy, but also to highly centralize, promoting democracy is precisely to seek ideological unity and ensure centralization. We must fully implement Lenin's famous provision: Before a problem is decided, freedom of expression and debate are allowed; but after the problem has been decided by the majority and approved by the higher level, it is necessary to fully obey and resolutely implement it. It is necessary to ensure that the democratic life within the Party is conducted in an organized and orderly manner under centralized leadership, and it is necessary to make the promotion of democracy able to enhance the ability and confidence of the Party's leading organs to solve problems and carry out work, rather than weaken this ability and confidence. The Party Constitution stipulates that our Party's organizational principle is democratic centralism, which is "centralization based on democracy and democracy under the guidance of centralization," and neither can be neglected.

True collective leadership must be combined with individual responsibility. Now, people are generally wary of acts that undermine the Party's collective leadership, and the phenomenon of individuals making major decisions in the Party has decreased. However, another deviation has emerged in some places, that is, putting individual responsibility and collective leadership in opposition to each other, turning collective leadership into no one being responsible or being afraid of individual responsibility. No matter how big or small, everything must be discussed at meetings; or being cautious and timid, shirking responsibility from each other, and even not saying what should be said, and not doing what should be done. For example, there is a county where even the location of the native product company's cattle pen must be collectively studied by the county Party committee; in Yunnan Province, there is a county Party committee with five secretaries and deputy secretaries, and everything must be signed jointly by the five people before it can be done. This phenomenon shows that some lower-level Party organizations still have a very incomplete understanding of the principle of collective leadership, and correctly and repeatedly explaining this principle to the Party's organizations at all levels and to all Party members is still an important task at present.

Comrades! On the road of socialist construction in our country, in extremely complex struggles, as long as the Party's leadership resolutely relies on the masses, adheres to the leadership method of "from the masses, to the masses," adheres to the principle of combining a high degree of democracy with a high degree of centralization, and the principle of combining collective leadership with individual responsibility, and struggles against phenomena that violate these principles, we can continuously improve the Party's leadership level and continue to achieve victory.

专栏：

    我对集体领导问题的认识和体会
    宋任穷同志的发言
    我完全同意刘少奇同志代表党中央委员会所作的政治报告，同意周恩来同志和邓小平同志的报告。刘少奇同志的报告，是我们党的具有历史意义的文献。它总结了过去的经验，对于今后我们国家的建设和党的建设有极其重大的意义。从第七次代表大会到第八次代表大会的十一年间，我们党和全国人民一起，执行了第七次代表大会所提出的“放手发动群众，壮大人民力量，团结全国一切可能团结的力量，打败侵略者，建设新中国”的路线，推翻了帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义的统治，建立了中华人民共和国。在全国胜利以后，我们又胜利地进行了社会主义建设和社会主义改造。这一切伟大的胜利，都是由于我们党创造性地运用了马克思列宁主义的理论，动员了全国人民的力量，经过长期的艰苦奋斗取得的。
    现在，我就集体领导问题说一说我的认识和在实际工作中的体会。
    健全党委制，发挥党委全体成员的作用
    根据人民群众是历史的真正创造者这一历史唯物主义的观点，我们党坚持民主集中制，确认在一切工作中贯彻执行群众路线的必要性。集体领导是民主集中制基本问题之一，其实质是群众路线在党的领导工作方面的应用。集体领导与家长式的个人领导相反，最能发挥党委成员的积极性，也最便于发挥人民群众的积极性，集中群众的智慧，正确地指引人民群众走向胜利。中国共产党章程规定：任何党的组织都必须严格遵守集体领导的原则。全党历来就重视并在自己的工作中认真贯彻执行这一规定，而且在这方面已取得了丰富的经验。
    要保证党的集体领导，必须健全党委制，发挥党委全体成员的作用。一九四八年九月党中央发布了关于健全党委制的决定，全党在贯彻执行中央这一决定中，使党的集体领导得到进一步的加强。但是还应该看到，目前有些党委，特别是在地委以下的某些党委中，由于前一个时期抽调的干部较多，一般是书记较老，委员较新，加之某些领导同志民主作风不够，这就很容易把过去的上下级关系反映到党委的集体领导中来。同时由于过去突击性的运动较多，党委任务繁重，常常纠缠在日常事务中，不能集中精力认真考虑和讨论重大问题，这就限制了集体力量的发挥。根据我们党的经验，要加强集体领导，必须充分发扬民主，健全党委制，发挥每个委员的积极性和创造性。每次会议，特别是解决重大问题的时候，事前必须进行周密准备，充分酝酿，互相提供有关情况，交换不同看法，在会上展开充分讨论，对于分歧意见，如非急迫问题，不必忙于作结论，以便在思想一致的基础上作出决定。党委书记在集体领导中有重大的责任，他必须和每个委员保持密切联系，经常沟通思想，善于组织大家钻研问题和出主意，发挥集体智慧，并要以身作则发扬民主，开展批评与自我批评。党委的每一个成员，都要积极参加集体领导，关心全面工作，互通情报，互相补充，把不同意见和问题摆到桌面上来。这样，才能做到思想一致，语言一致，合力搞好工作。正像毛泽东同志在一九四九年七届二中全会的结论中所教导我们的，书记要当好“班长”，要像弹钢琴一样十分和谐地进行自己的工作。
    集体领导必须建立在群众路线的基础上
    根据我们党的经验，必须在贯彻执行群众路线的基础上，才能真正健全党委制和加强集体领导。好的集体领导，不仅需要有健全的集体领导制度，重大问题经过集体讨论决定，还要善于依靠群众，走群众路线，充分地发扬民主，认真反映和集中群众的意见；不但在事情决定之前同群众商量，在执行过程中也要同群众商量，真正地作到领导与群众相结合，作到“从群众中来，到群众中去”。这样就能保证我们党的领导的正确，不犯或少犯错误。凡是这样做的，结果总是好的或较好的；反之，结果总是不好的，有时甚至造成错误。
    就我们大家所熟知的农业合作化和农业增产运动来看，也充分地说明了集体领导与群众路线是密切不可分的。一九五五年我国的农业合作化运动，中央彻底地批判了党内在这个问题上存在的右倾保守主义思想，作出了“关于农业合作化问题的决议”，各地在执行党中央的政策方针的时候，党委不但认真地进行了集体讨论，而且认真地作了调查研究，了解了广大农民的要求和发展农业合作社的可能性，把中央的指示和各地具体情况密切地结合了起来，这就使得全国各地的农业合作化运动迅速的形成了高潮，在很短的时间内很快的基本实现了农业合作化，满足了广大农民群众的要求。但是以后的农业增产运动，各地在根据中央拟定的增产指标制定本地方的规划或计划的时候，大部地区执行得比较好，也有不少地区，由于缺乏调查研究实事求是的作风，没有虚心听取下层干部和群众的意见，没有认真研究增产所必须具备的条件和必须采取的措施，从主观愿望出发，盲目地规定过高的不可能完成的生产指标，结果不得不一再修改，并在某些方面造成损失，使领导非常被动。
    这件事例表明，同样的领导集团，同样的领导成员，同样的开会讨论作出决定，其结果却不一样，一件事情做得较好，另一件事情做得不好。人们会问：为什么会产生这种现象呢？其关键在那里呢？我认为，其关键就在于这个领导集团是否具有明确的、坚定的、进行任何工作都必须贯彻群众路线的观点；是否切实地进行调查研究，虚心倾听和集中群众的意见，也就是说，能不能够真正地把集体领导与群众路线结合起来。我跟几位地委、市委书记交谈时，他们说，农业合作化运动所以搞得比较好，是因为认真地研究了中央的指示，深入地发动了群众，群众又推动了我们；以后的农业增产运动，虽然我们也研究了中央的指示，召开了各种会议进行讨论，但是因为我们没有掌握增加产量的实际可能性，把增产指标定得过高，并且在贯彻过程中向群众“坚持下去”的劲头大，从群众中“集中起来”的劲头小，结果出了毛病。这就说明，如果只是一般地注意了集体领导，而不注意与群众路线紧密结合，还是免不了会脱离实际、脱离群众的。所以决不能简单地说，有了集体领导的形式，就能够保证党的领导不犯重大错误了，有了集体领导的形式，一切问题就都解决了。在我们党的历史上那些犯过路线错误的领导集团，它们口头上也讲集体领导，重大问题也往往是经过会议讨论决定的，但是，它们实际上只有主观主义的集体领导，没有建立在群众路线基础上的实事求是的集体领导，结果是犯了严重错误。可见，问题的本质不简单地在于是否有集体领导的形式，而在于是否有集体领导的实质，也就是说是否把集体领导建立在群众路线的基础上。集体领导和群众路线是紧密联系而不可分割的，只有建立在群众路线基础上的集体领导，才是真正完满的可靠的，才能不断地改进工作和提高领导的水平。
    进行充分酝酿，重视少数人的意见
    在这方面，党中央的领导方法是值得全党学习的。党中央对于全国性的重大政策问题，只要情况许可，都是事先发动尽可能多的同志充分酝酿的。例如：一九四五年党的第七次全国代表大会的召开，一九五五年关于农业合作化问题的解决，“一九五六年到一九六七年全国农业发展纲要（草案）”的制定，这次大会的主要文件，以及其他许许多多的重大事情，都是经过充分酝酿的。这就告诉我们：党委在决定重大问题的时候，必须在党内进行充分的酝酿，充分地反映和集中群众的意见，以便作出正确的决定。那种简单的在短期内写个决定，或者单纯依靠行政命令的办法，是不能解决问题的。
    在进行酝酿和讨论过程中，应当重视少数人的意见，有些党组织的负责人常常不愿意倾听和考虑少数人的意见，甚至害怕有人提出反面意见来，这是不对的。河北省有个县委书记告诉我，他们在讨论购买粮食和农业增产问题的时候，都曾遇到过少数人从反面提出不同的意见，而结果，却是采纳了少数人的意见，避免了错误。他们在讨论一九五六年农业增产指标的时候，大多数县委委员主张每亩增产到六百斤（超过一九五五年产量二百九十斤的百分之一百以上），只有个别同志不赞成，以后再三考虑了少数人的意见，研究了典型调查材料，才把增产指标确定为每亩三百五十斤。事后证明，这是符合实际的。这种事例在实际工作中是会遇到的。不可否认，在一般情况下，多数人的意见是正确的。可是有些时候少数人的意见也会是正确的。这是因为，这些少数人的意见，虽然在党委会上看来是少数，但是他们的意见是从群众中来的，实际上反映着多数群众的利益。可见，一个反面意见提出来或者保留起来，并没有什么坏处，即使这个反面意见是错误的，也有助于领导上从多方面反复地考虑问题，使党的决定能最大限度地避免片面性和错误，同时可以使得党内更加团结。
    民主和集中，集体领导和个人负责要结合起来
    充分发扬党内民主，并不否认党的领导需要有高度的集中，而是要把两者辩证地结合起来，既要放手发扬民主，又要高度集中，发扬民主正是为了求得思想一致，保证集中。必须完全实行列宁这一著名的规定：在问题尚未决定以前，允许自由发表意见，进行辩论；但在问题已经多数决定和上级批准以后，就需要完全服从，坚决执行。必须保障党内的民主生活是在集中领导下有组织、有秩序地进行，必须使发扬民主能够增强党的领导机关解决问题、进行工作的能力和信心，而不是削弱这种能力和信心。党的章程规定我们党的组织原则是民主集中制，就是“在民主基础上的集中和在集中指导下的民主”，两者是不可偏废的。
    真正的集体领导，是一定要同个人负责相结合的。现在，对于破坏党的集体领导的行为一般都有所警惕，党内个人决定重大问题的现象是减少了。但是，有些地方又产生了另一种偏向，就是把个人负责和集体领导对立起来，把集体领导变成无人负责或者是害怕个人负责，不论大小事情，都要开会讨论；或者是谨小慎微，互相推诿责任，甚至应该讲的话也不讲了，应该作的事也不作了。例如，有一个县，连土产公司的牛圈设在那里，也要经过县委集体研究；云南省有一个县委，有正副书记五人，所有事情都要五人共同签字才能够办。这种现象表明，有些下级党的组织对于集体领导这个原则的认识还是很不全面的，向党的各级组织和全体党员正确地反复地阐明这项原则，仍然是当前的一项重要工作。
    同志们！在我国社会主义建设的道路上，在极其复杂的斗争中，只要党的领导坚决贯彻依靠群众，坚持“从群众中来，到群众中去”的领导方法，坚持高度的民主和高度的集中相结合，和集体领导与个人负责相结合的原则，并且同违反这些原则的现象进行斗争，就能不断提高党的领导水平，继续取得胜利。
