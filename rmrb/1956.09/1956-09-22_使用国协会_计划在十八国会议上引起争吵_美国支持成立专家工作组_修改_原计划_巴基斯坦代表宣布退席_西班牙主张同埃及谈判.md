Xinhua News Agency, London, September 21st: The eighteen-nation conference discussing the establishment of a "Canal Users' Association" continued on September 20th. Given the reservations expressed by some countries, the conference decided to establish an "expert working group" to "clarify the opinions already raised at the conference" in order to make the plan appear more acceptable to those countries that still oppose the plan or remain noncommittal.

The suggestion to establish an "expert working group" was put forward by the Turkish representative at the end of the morning session. It was supported by Dulles and adopted by the conference. Dulles explained to other national representatives that the working group was merely a tool to "clarify" the issues involved in the situation, and that participation in the working group did not mean that participants would necessarily agree with its outcome in the future.

However, shortly after the "expert working group" began its work, the Pakistani representative announced his withdrawal. This indicates that Pakistan still opposes the plan.

Meanwhile, the Swedish representative, Foreign Minister Undén, left London by plane on the afternoon of the 20th to return to Stockholm. He handed over the position of head of the Swedish delegation to the Swedish Ambassador to the UK, Hägglöf. Undén said during the morning session on the 20th: "The Swedish government firmly advocates submitting the Suez Canal issue to the United Nations at the current stage. From the speeches I have heard, I can conclude that the governments that invited us to this conference are not prepared to submit this dispute to the United Nations immediately. I deeply regret this position. I believe that submitting the Suez issue to the United Nations is the most important step to take at present."

Several other national representatives also spoke at the morning session. Spanish Foreign Minister Artajo said that he agreed with the proposal to establish a "Users' Association," but that this association should not be an organization that inherits the Suez Canal Company, but rather an agency to conduct new negotiations with Egypt on a broader basis than the proposals of the eighteen-nation conference. The main objective of the new negotiations must be to revise the Constantinople Convention to make it compatible with the current situation.

Artajo summarized the Spanish delegation's views as follows: First, the correct approach is to conduct direct negotiations with Egypt. Second, the time is not yet ripe to appeal to the United Nations. Third, the main purpose of the "Users' Association" is to maintain consistency in goals and actions. Fourth, the "Users' Association" should reach an understanding with the Egyptian authorities on practical steps to maintain the efficiency of the canal's use.

Ethiopian representative Wolde stated at the meeting that his country was unwilling to conflict with Egypt and that he would make detailed comments on Dulles' plan later.

Portuguese Foreign Minister Cunha said that he supported the proposal to establish a "Users' Association," but that this association should be a negotiating body.

The "expert working group" prepared a "working document on the Cooperation Association of Suez Canal Users" on the afternoon of the 20th and submitted it to the conference for discussion. According to various sources, the current strategy of the Western powers is to use the "expert working group" to make some "modifications" to the "overly radical" parts of the original "Users' Association" plan, based on the opinions of other countries, in order to win the support of more countries.

    “使用国协会”计划在十八国会议上引起争吵
    美国支持成立专家工作组“修改”原计划
    巴基斯坦代表宣布退席　西班牙主张同埃及谈判
    据新华社伦敦21日电　讨论建立“运河使用国协会”问题的十八国会议9月20日继续举行。鉴于一些国家采取的保留态度，会上决定成立“专家工作组”来“澄清已经在会议上提出的意见”，以便使计划看来比较能为那些仍然反对计划或者不置可否的国家所接受。
    成立“专家工作组”的建议是土耳其代表在上午会议中最后提出的，它得到杜勒斯的支持，并且为会议所通过。杜勒斯向其他国家代表解释说，工作组只不过是“澄清”局势中所牵涉到的问题的一个工具，参加工作组并不意味着参加者将来都要同意它的结果。
    但是，在“专家工作组”开始进行工作以后不久，巴基斯坦代表就宣布退席。这表明巴基斯坦仍然反对这个计划。
    同时，瑞典代表、外交大臣恩顿在20日下午离开伦敦乘飞机回斯德哥尔摩。他把瑞典代表团团长职务交给瑞典驻英大使哈根洛弗来担任。恩顿在20日上午会议举行的时候发言说：“瑞典政府坚决主张在目前的阶段把苏伊士运河问题提交联合国。我从听到的发言中可以得出这样的结论：邀请我们参加这个会议的政府并不准备立刻把这个争端提交联合国。我对这种立场感到十分遗憾。我认为，把苏伊士问题提交联合国是目前需要采取的最重要步骤。”
    在上午会议上还有好几个国家的代表发了言。西班牙外交部长阿塔霍说，他同意成立“使用国协会”的主张，但是这个协会不应当作为继承苏伊士运河公司的组织，而应该作为在比十八国会议的建议更广泛的基础上同埃及进行新的谈判的机构。进行新的谈判的主要目标必须是修改君士坦丁堡公约，使它合乎当前的情况。
    阿塔霍总结西班牙代表团的意见说：首先，正确的途径就是同埃及进行直接谈判。第二，诉诸联合国的时机尚未成熟。第三，“使用国协会”的主要目的是要保持目标和行动的一致。第四，“使用国协会”应该在保持运河的使用效率的实际措施上同埃及当局达成谅解。
    埃塞俄比亚代表沃耳德在会上表示，他的国家不愿意同埃及冲突，他要在以后对杜勒斯的计划作详细的评论。
    葡萄牙外交部长库纳说，他支持成立“使用国协会”的主张，但是这个协会应该是一个谈判机构。
    “专家工作组”在20日下午已经准备了一份“关于苏伊士运河使用国合作协会的工作文件”，并且提交给会议讨论。据各方面的消息说西方三国目前的策略是，通过“专家工作组”来根据其他国家意见对“使用国协会”原有计划中的“过激”部分作一些“修改”，以便于拉拢较多的国家来支持它。
