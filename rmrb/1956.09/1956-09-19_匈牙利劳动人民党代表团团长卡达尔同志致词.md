Dear Delegates to the Congress! Dear Comrades!

    Please allow me, on behalf of the Hungarian people and the Hungarian Working People's Party, to extend fraternal congratulations to the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China.

    The great achievements made by the Chinese people under the leadership of the Communist Party over the past decade have greatly excited the Hungarian people. China's industrial output has increased by 65 percent in the last three years, and more than 90 percent of farmers have joined cooperatives. At the same time, tremendous achievements have been made in various fields. All this has been recognized and praised by the world.

    In the process of building socialism, the Chinese Communists have consistently and creatively applied Marxist-Leninist theory to China's specific conditions, and have achieved many successes in this regard, providing valuable experience for the Communists of other countries, including Hungary. The Hungarian Working People's Party attaches great importance to all this.

    The Hungarian people also hope that Taiwan, an inseparable part of China's territory, will soon return to the embrace of great China, and that the independent People's Republic of China will soon obtain its legitimate status in the United Nations.

    The Hungarian working people deeply love the Chinese people and their leaders because the People's Republic of China has made great contributions to consolidating peace in the Far East and the world in the process of building a new life.

    What fills us with joy is that the friendly relations between China and Hungary in the political, economic, and cultural fields have developed smoothly in recent years. The visits to our country by the delegation headed by Comrade Zhu De and other Chinese comrades, as well as the performance tour of the Chinese Art Troupe in our country, are outstanding examples of this fraternal cooperation. The Hungarian people welcomed the Chinese guests with sincere feelings from the bottom of their hearts, because such visits can greatly promote the development of good relations between our two peoples. We believe that our important task is to further strengthen the connections between China and Hungary in all aspects.

    Dear Comrades! Under the leadership of its own Communist Party, with the help of the Soviet Union, China, and other fraternal people's democracies, and by applying their experiences, the Hungarian people have achieved great successes in socialist construction. Our industry has overcome the serious consequences of the war, and now industrial production is two and a half times higher than in 1938, and it is progressing year by year. We have also made great achievements in the socialist transformation of agriculture. The socialist component of our agriculture owns one-third of the country's arable land. Our cultural revolution is striding forward. We are proud of the achievements we have made in science, literature and art, and sports.

    The Hungarian Working People's Party has learned from the lessons of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and has examined its own work based on these lessons. In order to eliminate the harmful phenomenon of the personality cult, to consolidate collective leadership, and to strengthen intra-party democracy, the Central Committee of our Party made a significant decision at its July meeting. Important measures have also been taken to consolidate the socialist legal system and to further develop socialist democracy. On this basis, party unity and the connection between the party and the working masses have been further strengthened. Our party and people, together with all friendly countries, are confidently marching towards the final victory of socialism.

    We assure our Chinese comrades that the Hungarian Working People's Party and the Hungarian People's Republic will always be reliable allies and comrades-in-arms to all fraternal parties, to the camp composed of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and all socialist countries, and to the people of all countries fighting for peace, freedom, and independence.

    Dear Comrades! Please allow me to read the congratulatory message brought by our delegation:

    "To the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China

    Dear Comrades!

    On behalf of the Hungarian Working People's Party and the Hungarian working people, we extend warm fraternal congratulations to the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China and to the great Chinese people.

    The Communist Party of China led the heroic Chinese people to achieve the independence of their motherland, to successfully carry out socialist construction, and to win the profound sympathy and love of the people of all countries and the Hungarian people. The great achievements made by People's China in the economic, cultural, and national life guarantee that the People's Republic of China plays an outstanding role in international life. China's peaceful policies promote the consolidation of peace in the Far East and the world.

    Dear Comrades! The Chinese Communists are fighting to further consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, strengthen the unity of all the Chinese people, complete their national economic plans, further develop Marxist-Leninist theory, strive for the final victory of socialism, and consolidate peace in Asia and the world. We sincerely wish your congress to be the starting point for a new victory in this struggle.

        The Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party"

    Finally, to express our love for the Communist Party of China, please allow me to present the flag given by the Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party to the esteemed presidium of the Congress.

    We wish all participants in the Congress and all Chinese Communists good health and more achievements in their future work.

    Long live the great Communist Party of China and the great Chinese people!

    匈牙利劳动人民党代表团团长卡达尔同志致词敬爱的代表大会代表们！亲爱的同志们！
    请允许我代表匈牙利人民和匈牙利劳动人民党，向中国共产党第八次代表大会，致以兄弟的祝贺。　　中国人民在共产党领导下十年来获得的伟大成就，使匈牙利人民感到非常兴奋。三年来中国工业增加了百分之六十五，百分之九十以上的农户已经参加了合作社，同时在各个领域都取得了巨大的成就，这一切受到了全世界的重视和赞扬。
    中国共产党人在建设社会主义的过程中，一贯地和创造性地把马克思列宁主义理论运用于中国的具体条件，并且在这方面获得了许多成绩，给其他国家和匈牙利的共产党人提供了有益的经验。匈牙利劳动人民党对于这一切非常重视。
    匈牙利人民也希望，中国不可分割的领土台湾能够早日回到伟大中国的怀抱里，独立的中华人民共和国能够早日在联合国取得合法的地位。
    匈牙利劳动人民非常热爱中国人民和他们的领导者，因为中华人民共和国在建设新生活的过程中，对巩固远东和世界和平作出了巨大的贡献。
    使我们内心充满愉快的是，中国和匈牙利之间的政治、经济和文化方面的友好关系，在最近几年中得到了顺利的发展。以朱德同志为首的代表团及其他中国同志到我国的访问，和中国艺术团在我国的访问演出，就是这种兄弟合作的突出事件。匈牙利人民用出自内心的真挚的感情欢迎了中国客人，因为这样的访问能够大大促进我们两国人民相互间的良好关系的发展。我们认为，我们重要的任务就是进一步加强中国和匈牙利在各方面的联系。
    亲爱的同志们！匈牙利人民在自己的共产党的领导下，在苏联、中国和兄弟的人民民主国家的帮助下，并由于运用了它们的经验，在社会主义建设中获得了很大的成绩。我们的工业已经克服了战争给它造成的严重后果，现在工业的生产已比一九三八年增加了二倍半，并且在年年向前发展。在农业社会主义改造方面，我们也获得了很大的成绩。我们农业的社会主义成份，拥有全国三分之一的耕地。我国的文化革命，正在大踏步地向前迈进。我们为我们在科学、文艺和体育运动方面所获得的成绩而感到自豪。
    匈牙利劳动人民党吸取了苏联共产党第二十次代表大会的教训，并根据这些教训检查了自己的工作。为了消除个人崇拜的有害现象，为了巩固集体领导，为了加强党内民主，我们党的中央委员会在七月会议上作出了具有重大意义的决定。为了巩固社会主义法制，为了进一步发展社会主义民主，也采取了重要的措施。在这种基础上，党内团结、党同劳动群众的联系进一步加强了。我们的党和人民同各友好国家一起，正在满怀信心地走向社会主义的最后胜利。
    我们向中国同志们保证，匈牙利劳动人民党和匈牙利人民共和国对于各兄弟党，对于由苏联、中华人民共和国和一切社会主义国家组成的阵营，对于为和平、自由、独立而斗争的各国人民，永远是可靠的盟友和战友。
    亲爱的同志们！请允许我宣读我们代表团带来的贺词：
    “致中国共产党第八次代表大会
    亲爱的同志们！
    我们代表匈牙利劳动人民党和匈牙利劳动人民，向中国共产党第八次代表大会，向伟大的中国人民，致以热烈的兄弟的祝贺。
    中国共产党领导英勇的中国人民，争取到了祖国的独立，顺利地进行着社会主义建设，争得了世界各国人民和匈牙利人民的深刻的同情和热爱。人民中国在经济、文化和国家生活方面获得的伟大成就，保证中华人民共和国在国际生活中起着卓越的作用。中国的和平政策促进了远东和世界和平的巩固。
    亲爱的同志们！中国共产党人正在进行斗争，来进一步巩固工农联盟，加强中国全体人民的团结，完成自己的国民经济计划，进一步发展马克思列宁主义理论，争取社会主义事业的最后胜利，巩固亚洲和全世界的和平。我们衷心地祝你们的大会是这一斗争中的新胜利的起点。
        匈牙利劳动人民党中央委员会”
    最后，为了表示对中国共产党的热爱，请允许我把匈牙利劳动人民党中央委员会所赠送的旗帜交代表大会的可敬的主席团。
    我们祝代表大会的全体参加者和中国全体共产党员身体健康，并在今后的工作中取得更多的成就。
    伟大的中国共产党和伟大的中国人民万岁！
