Chen Chu, Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of the Embassy of the People's Republic of China in the Soviet Union, also spoke at the meeting. He said that in the past seven years, thanks to the unity and efforts of the Chinese people, the selfless assistance of the great Soviet Union and other brotherly countries, and the sympathy and support of peace-loving countries and people all over the world, many great changes are taking place on the land of our country. Many long-cherished good wishes in the old China have been or are becoming reality.

Chen Chu said that while celebrating the seventh anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China has just concluded. The Congress of our Party summarized the victorious experience of the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle, expounded the theory and policy of building socialism in our country, and made many important decisions in the construction of the Party and the life of the Party. Therefore, this Congress will surely further prepare ideologically, politically, and organizationally for the complete victory of socialist construction in our country.

While affirming the achievements, the Congress of our Party pointed out that there are still extremely arduous tasks in future construction work, there are shortcomings in our work, our own experience is still very insufficient, and we must strive to overcome difficulties and prevent mistakes. Therefore, the Party calls on us to be good at learning from the people's democratic countries, be good at learning from the fraternal parties of the world, and be good at learning from the people of all countries in the world. What should be specially mentioned here is that consolidating and developing the friendly cooperation between China and the Soviet Union is the lofty task that the Chinese people will never change, and learning from the Soviet Union is an important principle of the Chinese people in revolution and construction. Your selfless assistance is of decisive significance to the socialist construction of our country. You are full of the spirit of internationalism and bring the latest science and technology to our people. The experts you send work selflessly in our country for the happiness of our people with brotherly affection. Therefore, whenever we talk about our achievements in our work, we always put the great friendship and great assistance of the Soviet people in the important position it deserves.

Chen Chu finally said that maintaining world peace and promoting human progress is the firm and unswerving policy of the People's Republic of China in international affairs. Our policy of peaceful coexistence does not exclude any country, and we extend the hand of friendship to the whole world. Our people and our motherland need peace, justice is on our side, and our friends are getting more and more. We must further strengthen the friendly unity between the Chinese and Soviet people, and further expand the friendly ties with the people of the world. As long as the people of all countries in the world unite and persevere in the cause of maintaining peace and opposing war, all the conspiracies of the aggression and war groups are bound to fail.

    我国驻苏联大使馆临时代办陈楚在大会上讲话
    中华人民共和国驻苏联大使馆临时代办陈楚也在会上讲了话。他说，七年以来，由于中国人民的团结和努力，由于伟大苏联和其他兄弟国家的无私援助，由于全世界爱好和平国家和人民的同情和支持，在我们国家的土地上正发生着许多伟大的变化。在旧中国很多梦寐以求的良好愿望已经或者正在变成现实。
    陈楚说，在庆贺中华人民共和国成立七周年的时候，中国共产党的第八次全国代表大会刚刚闭幕。我们党的这次代表大会总结了中国人民革命斗争的胜利经验，阐明了在我国建设社会主义的理论和政策，并且在党的建设和党的生活中作出了许多重大的决定。因此，这次代表大会必将进一步在思想上、政治上、组织上，准备我国社会主义建设的完全胜利。
    我们党的代表大会在肯定成就的同时，指出在今后的建设工作中还有极其繁重的任务，我们的工作还有缺点，自己的经验还很不够，而且还必须努力克服困难和防止错误。因此，党号召我们必须善于向各人民民主国家学习，善于向世界各兄弟党学习，善于向世界各国人民学习。这里应该特别提到的是：巩固和发展中苏两国的友好合作，是中国人民万年不渝的崇高任务，学习苏联是中国人民在革命和建设中的一项重要原则。你们的无私援助，对于我国社会主义的建设有着决定的意义。你们充满着国际主义的精神，把最新的科学技术带给我们的人民。你们派出的专家用兄弟一般的情谊在我国为我们人民的幸福而忘我地工作。因此，我们每当谈到自己工作上的成就的时候，都把苏联人民的伟大的友谊和伟大援助放在应得的重要地位。
    陈楚最后说，维护世界和平和促进人类进步是中华人民共和国在国际事务中坚定不移的方针。我们的和平共处政策不排斥任何国家，我们向全世界都伸出友谊的手。我们的人民，我们的祖国需要和平，正义是在我们这一边，我们的朋友是越来越多了。我们要进一步加强中苏两国人民的友好团结，进一步扩大同全世界人民的友谊联系，只要全世界各国人民在维护和平、反对战争的事业中团结一致坚持奋斗，侵略和战争集团的一切阴谋是一定要失败的。
