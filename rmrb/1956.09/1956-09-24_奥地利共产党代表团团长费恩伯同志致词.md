Comrades!
    Our delegation extends to your Party and to the entire Chinese people the heartfelt, fraternal respect of the Austrian Communists and all progressive forces in Austria.
    Although this is our first visit to China, and we have only spent a few days in your great land, we have already sensed a powerful force emanating from your people's unified desire for freedom, peace, and socialism. China has hundreds of millions of people, but your strength does not rely solely on this number, because you once had hundreds of millions of people, but your country was oppressed by imperialists, and your people were plundered by domestic exploiters and lost their future. The Communist Party awakened your people to their own strength, guided them to victory over domestic and foreign oppressors, and pointed them to the path of peaceful, happy life towards socialism. Today, 600 million Chinese people, together with the socialist Soviet Union, stand at the forefront of the struggle for world peace and progress, and their role and significance has greatly increased. Therefore, it is natural that the Communist Parties of all countries congratulate your Party and your people on their new victories, and congratulate the success of your Eighth Party Congress. We Austrian Communists wholeheartedly join in this congratulation.
    We can say with confidence that your Congress is of great significance to the entire socialist movement. The courage of your Party in seeking new ways to build socialism is admirable. Your Party has found these new paths because it always makes a deep analysis of objective reality when applying Marxism-Leninism. Your working methods have helped other Communist Parties and are an example to them.
    Comrades! Our country is small, and it took ten years to gain autonomy through the state treaty. The American imperialists do not want to leave our country, because we are in an important strategic point in the heart of Europe and border the people's democratic countries. We were able to obtain the state treaty and independence thanks primarily to the peace policy of the Soviet Union.
    Our country has declared permanent neutrality. We Communists want to defend Austria's neutrality, because we know that this is a blow to the imperialist war policy. We want to work for the unity between the working class and our people in order to safeguard our country's independence. At the same time, we are inextricably linked with the communist army headed by the glorious banner of the Soviet Union. Therefore, even if we are a small country and thousands of miles away from you, we, comrades, are fighting together with you.
    Long live the international solidarity of the working class!
    Long live the struggle for a guaranteed peace!
    Long live the Chinese Communist Party and its Eighth Party Congress! (Attached picture)

    奥地利共产党代表团团长费恩伯同志致词同志们！
    我们的代表团向你们的党及全体中国人民转达奥地利共产党人及全奥一切进步力量的衷心的、兄弟般的敬意。
    虽然我们是第一次来到中国，并且在你们伟大的国土上仅仅耽了几天的工夫，但是我们已经觉察到一种从你们人民在要求自由、和平及社会主义的一致愿望中所发出来的强大力量。中国有数亿人口，可是你们的力量并不仅仅依靠在这数字上，因为从前你们也有几亿的人，但是你们的国家曾被帝国主义者压迫，你们的人民曾被国内的剥削者所掠夺而失去前途。共产党使你们的人民觉悟到了自己的力量，引导他们对国内外的压迫者取得胜利，并为他们指出了通往社会主义的和平、幸福的生活大道。今天，六万万的中国人民，和社会主义的苏联一起，站在为全世界的和平和进步而作的斗争的前端，他们的作用和意义大力地增长了。因此，很自然地，各国共产党人都祝贺你们的党及你们的人民获得新的胜利，祝贺你们的第八次党代表大会工作获得成就。我们奥地利共产党人全心全意地参加这一祝贺。
    我们可以满怀信心地说，你们的代表大会对于整个社会主义运动是有很大意义的。你们的党寻找新方法来建设社会主义的那种勇气，是令人敬佩的。你们的党找到了这些新的途径，是因为它在应用马克思列宁主义时，总是对客观现实作了深入的分析。你们的工作方法帮助了其他共产党，而且是它们的榜样。
    同志们！我们的国家很小，化了十年的时间才通过国家条约获得了自主权，美帝国主义者不想离开我们的国家，因为我们是处在欧洲心脏的一个重要战略点，并且又和人民民主国家接壤。我们所以能够获得国家条约及独立，首先要感谢苏联的和平政策。
    我国已宣布了永久中立。我们共产党人要保卫奥地利的中立，因为我们知道，这就是给帝国主义战争政策的一个打击。我们要为工人阶级及我国人民之间的团结而努力，以维护我国的独立。同时，我们也和以苏联的光荣旗帜为首的共产主义大军不可分割地紧结在一起。所以，即使我们是一个小国，并且与你们相距千万里，我们也和你们，同志们，在一起进行着斗争。
    工人阶级的国际团结万岁！
    为争取一个有保证的和平而作的斗争万岁！
    中国共产党和它的第八次党代表大会万岁！（附图片）
