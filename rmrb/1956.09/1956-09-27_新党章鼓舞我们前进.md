    The Party Constitution adopted by our Party's Eighth National Congress is suited to the Party's tasks and conditions in the current period. It systematically absorbs the new and rich experiences that the Party has accumulated in its great struggles since the Seventh National Congress eleven years ago. It is a powerful weapon to encourage and promote the rapid advancement of our Party's organization and cause.
    Why did we revise the Party Constitution? This is because our Party is now fully in a leading position in all aspects of national life. At the same time, we have basically completed the socialist revolution. The Party faces a new and great task, which is to build our country into a great socialist state. Under such circumstances, we must further improve the quality of the Party, better promote the fine tradition of the mass line, expand intra-party democracy, promote the enthusiasm and creativity of party members and party organizations, and consolidate the party's unity and unification. It is based on these conditions and requirements that the Eighth National Congress of the Party revised and adopted the new Party Constitution.
    The new Party Constitution concisely summarizes the Party's political tasks and organizational principles in the General Program. It stipulates that the Party must resolutely strive to mobilize and unite all possible active forces, continue to develop the national economy in a planned way, and at the same time, must continue to pay attention to overcoming capitalist factors and influences from all aspects, in order to win the complete victory of the great socialist cause. In order to guarantee the victory of the socialist cause, the Party must tirelessly consolidate our country's people's democratic dictatorship, develop democratic life, consolidate the worker-peasant alliance and the united front of all patriotic forces, consolidate the long-term cooperative relationship with various democratic parties and non-party democratic personages, and must complete the task of liberating Taiwan. The General Program of the Party Constitution also establishes the Party's consistent foreign policy of safeguarding world peace and advocating peaceful coexistence, and emphasizes the need to educate its members and people with the spirit of proletarian internationalism. The provisions of the General Program of the Party Constitution regarding the Party's organizational principles are fully elaborated in the articles of the Party Constitution.
    The new Party Constitution places higher demands on party members. This can be clearly seen from its provisions regarding the qualifications of party members and the obligations of party members. The new Party Constitution stipulates that party members must be people who engage in labor and do not exploit the labor of others. This is because our socialist revolution has been basically completed. Under such circumstances, the Party should of course make such a clear provision. Such a provision can not only prevent exploiters from mixing into the Party, but also enable Party members to strictly draw a line between labor and exploitation ideologically. In the new Party Constitution, ten articles are stipulated regarding the obligations of party members, among which are maintaining the unity and unification of the Party, actively completing the tasks assigned by the Party, strictly abiding by the Party Constitution and national laws, observing communist morality, practicing criticism and self-criticism, exposing shortcomings and errors in work, being loyal and honest to the Party, and constantly being vigilant against the enemy's conspiracies. These are all more clearly defined than in the previous Party Constitution, or new content has been added. The Party puts forward higher demands on party members than in the past, because our Party has led the national regime and is in a leading position in all aspects. At a time when the revolution has already been victorious, it is inevitable that some opportunists will take the glorious title of Communist Party member as a means to seek personal fame and gain. At the same time, although the level of consciousness of the vast majority of our Party members is relatively high, there are still a few Party members, especially new Party members, whose level of consciousness is not high enough to fully play the role that Party members should play. The new Party Constitution puts forward higher requirements for party members, which can ensure the purity of the Party's ranks and improve the quality of the Party. According to the new situation, the new Party Constitution has also made new provisions for admission procedures and the probationary period.
    According to the provisions of the new Party Constitution, party members enjoy full and extensive democratic rights. Every party member will continuously and rapidly improve their ideological and political level and work ability in the process of exercising their democratic rights. Every party member can freely and unrestrictedly raise discussions on the Party's work and various resolutions if they have different opinions, in accordance with the procedures and methods stipulated in the Party Constitution. Even after the majority has reached a unanimous conclusion, any individual can still reserve different opinions if they have them. No one should force others to obey their own opinions. The new Party Constitution grants party members these rights, which will greatly facilitate the development of party members' independent thinking, make discussions of party theories, policies, and various work issues more adequate, and make intra-party democratic life more active. This kind of democracy is of great benefit to ensuring the correct implementation of the Party's policies and resolutions, giving play to the enthusiasm and sense of responsibility of party members, improving the Party's collective leadership, and enhancing the Party's unity. Because the unity of ideological understanding is the most reliable foundation of the Party's unity; and the strengthening of unity on the basis of ideological unity will make our Party's cause increasingly prosperous. The new Party Constitution also stipulates that any party member and party organization must respect these rights of party members and must not infringe upon them. If there is any disrespect for these rights of party members, criticism and education should be given; if there is any infringement of these rights of party members, it is a violation of Party discipline and disciplinary action should be given. Party organizations at all levels and every party member should strictly abide by these provisions of the Party Constitution and effectively protect these rights of party members. For party members who make suggestions, as long as they are not conspiring to sabotage, and as long as their suggestions are put forward in accordance with the procedures and methods stipulated in the Party Constitution, then, regardless of whether their suggestions are correct or not, they should be given effective protection so that they are not suppressed and hindered, and their suggestions should be carefully studied.
    Democratic centralism is the Party's fundamental organizational principle. Based on the Party's practical experience, the new Party Constitution has made more complete provisions for democratic centralism than the original Party Constitution. The new Party Constitution stipulates that the Party's leading organs at all levels must regularly listen to the opinions of lower-level Party organizations and party members, study their experiences, and promptly solve their problems. This provision is a concrete application of the Party's mass line in Party life. It can not only make the relationship between the Party's upper and lower levels closer; more importantly, it can enable the Party's leading organs to maintain a clear head, make decisions that conform to objective reality, and constantly absorb the experience of lower-level organizations and party members. The new Party Constitution also stipulates that for the Party's policy issues, before the Party's leading organs have made a resolution, the Party's lower-level organizations and members of the Party Committee can put forward their own suggestions to the Party's leading organs based on the actual situation in their locality; for the resolutions of higher-level organizations, if the lower-level organizations believe that they do not conform to the actual situation in their region or department, they can request the higher-level organizations to change the resolution. Of course, if the higher-level organization believes that the resolution should still be implemented, the lower-level organization must implement it unconditionally. The new Party Constitution also appropriately divides the powers of the central and local governments, and issues of a local nature and issues that need to be decided by local governments should be handled by local organizations. These provisions will greatly encourage the lower-level organizations and party members of the Party to have a higher enthusiasm and sense of responsibility for the socialist cause, and will be more able to implement the Party's policies flexibly in accordance with local conditions.
    Our new Party Constitution stipulates the implementation of a permanent system of Party Congresses. The Party Congress is the Party's highest decision-making organ and highest supervisory organ. The implementation of a permanent system of Party Congresses can more fully exert this role of the Party Congress; in peacetime, representatives can also strengthen ties with the masses and supervise the Party's leading organs, which can make the Party's democratic life more vibrant.
    The new Party Constitution stipulates the responsibilities of grass-roots organizations in more detail. The new Party Constitution clearly stipulates that grass-roots organizations in enterprises, rural areas, schools, and the armed forces have the right to lead and supervise the work of their units, and requires all grass-roots organizations to lead the masses to carry out criticism and self-criticism, expose and eliminate shortcomings and errors in work, and fight against all illegal and undisciplined phenomena, corruption and waste, and bureaucratism. In order to carry out these tasks, grass-roots organizations must better strengthen their ties with the masses and more effectively protect and promote the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses inside and outside the Party. The vast majority of our Party's grass-roots organizations have already done so. Whether in the production and construction of industrial and mining enterprises or in the cooperative movement, they have actively organized and supported the creative labor of the masses inside and outside the Party. However, there are also some grass-roots organizations that have not yet played their due role well. This is because the Party's leading organs at all levels lack specific leadership and assistance for them, and therefore, they do not yet understand how to improve and protect the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses and how to carry out their own work. The Party's leading organs at all levels should, in accordance with the provisions of the new Party Constitution, effectively strengthen the leadership of grass-roots organizations, so that the Party's grass-roots organizations can play a greater role in the future.
    The great historical tasks facing our Party urgently require strengthening the Party's leadership over all work. In order to strengthen the Party's leadership, on the one hand, we must fight against all ideas and practices that attempt to weaken the Party's leading role; on the other hand, we must strive to maintain the correctness of the Party's leadership. How to maintain correct leadership? This requires that the resolutions, instructions, and plans made by the leading organs conform to objective reality. To be able to conform to objective reality, we must first go deep into reality and conduct investigation and research. Therefore, the Party's leading organs must adhere to the working method of the mass line of "from the masses, to the masses." Facts have repeatedly proved that whoever adheres to the mass line can overcome various difficulties in work and achieve good results in work; whoever violates the mass line, his work will suffer failure. If we do not investigate and research the actual situation and do not follow the mass line, then the subjective errors in the work will inevitably occur, and one of the main manifestations of subjectivism is the well-known bureaucratism. Those who do not like to go deep into lower-level organizations and the masses of the people, do not like to listen to opinions from all sides, but are willing to sit in the office to formulate plans and issue orders, will inevitably fall into the abyss of subjectivism and bureaucratism, which is not surprising. We must do our best to overcome subjectivism and bureaucratism and do our best to improve leadership work.
    The new Party Constitution will further enhance the enthusiasm and creativity of all party members and party organizations at all levels, and greatly strengthen the Party's ties with the entire people. Our Party is now leading the 600 million people of China to struggle for the cause of socialism. The new Party Constitution embodies the requirements and strong unified will of our Party's organizations at all levels and all party members. It is the criterion for all aspects of our Party's life. It gives us new strength and inspires us to move forward towards new and great goals. We should conduct universal publicity and education on the new Party Constitution throughout the Party and raise the level of our Party's life to a higher level.

### 新党章鼓舞我们前进

    新党章鼓舞我们前进
    我们党的第八次全国代表大会所通过的党的章程，是同党在目前时期的任务和状况相适应的。它系统地吸收了自从党的第七次全国代表大会以来的十一年间党在伟大斗争中所积累的新的丰富经验。它是鼓舞和推动我们党的组织和党的事业迅速前进的有力武器。
    我们为什么要修改党章呢？这是因为现在我们的党在国家生活的一切方面已经完全居于领导地位。同时，我们已经基本上完成了社会主义革命。党面临着新的巨大任务，这就是要把我国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义国家。在这样的情况下面，我们就必须进一步提高党的质量，更好地发扬群众路线的优良传统，扩大党内民主，发扬党员和党组织的积极性和创造性，巩固党的团结和统一。党的第八次全国代表大会正是根据这些条件和要求，修改和通过了新的党章。
    新的党章在总纲中简要地概括了党在新时期的政治任务和组织原则。它规定了党必须坚决努力动员和团结一切可能动员和团结的积极力量，继续有计划地发展国民经济，同时必须继续注意从各方面克服资本主义的因素和影响，以争取伟大的社会主义事业的完全胜利。为了保障社会主义事业的胜利，党必须不倦地巩固我国的人民民主专政，发展民主生活，巩固工农联盟和一切爱国力量的统一战线，巩固同各民主党派和无党派民主人士的长期合作关系，并且必须完成解放台湾的任务。党章的总纲还确定了党一贯维护世界和平、主张和平共处的外交政策，并且强调要以无产阶级国际主义精神教育自己的党员和人民。党章总纲对于党的组织原则所做的规定，在党章的条文中都有了充分的发挥。
    新党章对党员提出了更高的要求。这从它关于党员的条件和党员义务的各项规定中可以看得很清楚。新党章规定党员必须是从事劳动而不剥削他人劳动的人。这是因为，我们的社会主义革命已经基本完成。在这种情况下，党当然应该做这样明确的规定。这样的规定，不但可以防止剥削分子混入党内，而且可以使党员在思想上严格地划清劳动和剥削的界限。在新党章中，关于党员的义务规定了十条，其中关于维护党的团结和统一、积极地完成党所分配的任务、严格遵守党章和国家法律、遵守共产主义道德、实行批评和自我批评、揭露工作中的缺点和错误、对党忠诚老实、时刻警惕敌人的阴谋活动，这些都比过去的党章规定得更加明确或者是增加了新的内容。党对党员提出比过去更高的要求，是因为我们党已经领导了全国政权，在一切方面都已经居于领导地位的缘故。在革命已经胜利的时候，难免会有一些投机分子，把取得共产党员的光荣称号作为猎取个人名利的手段。同时，目前虽然我们党的绝大多数党员的觉悟水平较高，但是，也还有少数党员，特别是新党员的觉悟水平不够高，还不能充分发挥党员应有的作用。新党章对党员提出了更高的要求，就可以保证党的队伍的纯洁，提高党的质量。根据新的情况，新党章对于入党手续和预备期也都作了新的规定。
    按照新党章的规定，党员享有充分广泛的民主权利。每一个党员在行使自己的民主权利的过程中，无论思想政治水平或者工作能力都会不断地迅速提高起来。每一个党员对于党的工作和各种决议，如果有不同的意见都可以自由地无拘束地按照党章规定的程序和方式提出讨论。即便在多数人一致得出结论之后，任何个人如果有不同的意见仍然可以保留。谁都不应该强迫别人服从自己的意见。新党章赋予党员这些权利，就将大大有利于发扬党员的独立思考，使党员对党的理论、政策以及各种工作问题的讨论更加充分，党内的民主生活更加活跃。这种民主对于保证党的政策决议的正确执行、发挥党员的积极性和责任心、健全党的集体领导、增强党的团结都有极大的好处。因为思想认识的一致，乃是党的团结的最可靠的基础；而在思想一致基础上的团结的加强，将使我们党的事业日益兴旺。新党章还规定，任何党员和党的组织对于党员的这些权利必须予以尊重，不许加以侵害。如果有不尊重党员这些权利的，应该给予批评和教育；如果有侵害党员这些权利的，就是违反党的纪律，应当给予纪律处分。各级党的组织和每个党员，都应该严格遵守党章的这些规定，切实保护党员的这些权利。对于提意见的党员，只要他不是阴谋破坏，只要他的意见是按照党章所规定的程序和方式提出的，那么，不管他的意见是否正确，都应该给予切实的保护，使他不受压制和阻难，并且要认真地研究他的意见。
    民主集中制是党的根本的组织原则。新党章根据党的实际经验，对民主集中制作出了比原有的党章更为完备的规定。新党章规定，党的各级领导机关必须经常听取下级党组织和党员的意见，研究他们的经验，及时地解决他们的问题。这一规定，是党的群众路线在党的生活中具体的运用。它不仅可以使党的上下级之间的关系更加密切起来；更重要的，它可以使党的领导机关保持清醒的头脑，做出符合客观情况的决定，并且不断地吸取下级组织和党员的经验。新党章还规定，对于党的政策问题，在党的领导机关没有作出决议以前，党的下级组织和党的委员会的成员，可以根据本地的实际情况，向党的领导机关提出自己的建议；对于上级组织的决议，如果下级组织认为不符合本地区、本部门的实际情况，可以请求上级改变决议。当然，如果上级组织认为仍然应当执行这个决议，下级组织就必须无条件地加以执行。新党章还适当地划分了中央和地方的职权，属于地方性质的问题和需要由地方决定的问题，应由地方组织处理。这些规定，将会大大地鼓舞党的下级组织和党员对社会主义事业的更加高涨的热情和责任心，更加能够因地制宜地灵活地执行党的政策。
    我们的新党章规定实行党代表大会的常任制。党代表大会是党的最高决策机关和最高监督机关，实行党代表大会的常任制，就可以更充分地发挥党代表大会的这种作用；在平时，代表又可以加强同群众的联系，对党的领导机关进行监督，这就可以使党的民主生活更加充满蓬蓬勃勃的朝气。
    新党章对基层组织比较详细地规定了它们的责任。新党章明确规定企业、农村、学校和部队中的基层组织有领导和监督本单位工作的权利，并且要求所有的基层组织，领导群众开展批评和自我批评，揭露和消除工作中的缺点和错误，同一切违法乱纪、贪污浪费和官僚主义的现象进行斗争。基层组织要执行这些任务，就必须更好地加强自己同群众的联系，更加切实有效地保护和发扬党内外群众的积极性和创造性。我们党的绝大部分基层组织已经这样做了，不论在工矿企业的生产和建设中，在合作化运动中，它们都积极地组织和支持党内外群众进行创造性的劳动。但是，也有一部分基层组织还没有很好地发挥它们应有的作用。这是因为党的各级领导机关对它们缺少具体的领导和帮助，因而，它们还不懂得应该怎样去提高和保护群众的积极性和创造性，怎样进行自己的工作。党的各级领导机关应该根据新党章的规定，切实加强对基层组织的领导，使党的基层组织在今后能够发挥更加巨大的作用。
    我们的党所面临的伟大历史任务，迫切地要求加强党对一切工作的领导。为了加强党的领导，我们一方面要同一切企图削弱党的领导作用的想法和作法进行斗争；一方面还要努力保持党的领导的正确。怎样保持正确的领导呢？这就要求领导机关所做的决议、指示和计划，符合于客观实际。要能够符合于客观实际，就要首先深入实际，进行调查研究。因此，党的领导机关必须坚持“从群众中来，到群众中去”的群众路线的工作方法。事实一再证明，谁坚持了群众路线，谁就可以克服工作中的各种困难，使工作获得良好成就；谁违背群众路线，谁的工作就会遭受失败。如果对实际情况不调查研究，不走群众路线，那末，工作中的主观主义毛病就将不可避免地要发生，而主观主义的主要表现之一就是人所共知的官僚主义。那些不大喜欢深入到下级组织和人民群众中去、不大喜欢倾听各方面的意见、而愿意坐在办公室里制定计划、发号施令的人，必然要掉进主观主义和官僚主义的深渊，这是毫不奇怪的。我们必须极力克服主观主义和官僚主义，极力改进领导工作。
    新的党章将进一步提高全体党员和各级党组织的积极性和创造性，大大加强党同全体人民群众的联系。我们的党现在正领导全中国六亿人民为社会主义的事业奋斗。新的党章体现了我们党的各级组织和全体党员的要求和坚强统一的意志。它是我们党的生活的各方面的准则。它给了我们以新的力量，鼓舞我们向着新的伟大的目标前进。我们应该在全党范围内进行关于新党章的普遍宣传教育工作，把我们党的生活提到更高的水平。
