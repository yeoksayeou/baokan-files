Xinhua News Agency, September 6th:

    Chinese Maritime Union representative Wang Pin-san expressed to Egyptian Commercial Representative to China, Faer, full support for Egypt's recruitment of foreign pilots to work in the Suez Canal.

    Wang Pin-san said, "Although China's maritime industry is not well-developed, and there are not many maritime talents, we are willing to do our best to help you. All Chinese sailors fully support the just struggle of the Egyptian people to nationalize the Suez Canal Company." He told Faer that since the recruitment advertisement was published in various newspapers and periodicals, many pilots have applied to go to Egypt.

    Faer asked Wang Pin-san to convey "the most sincere and deep gratitude" to the Chinese sailors. He said that Egypt appreciates the firm and strong support of the Chinese people and government. He felt that this assistance was particularly valuable because China also needs pilot talents in developing its own navigation industry.

    The Egyptian Commercial Representative introduced the main qualifications and procedures for applicants. In response to the question of whether pilots can bring their families, Faer said: "Certainly, because the treatment of pilots is very good."

    我海员工会代表访埃及商务代表
    表示支持埃及招聘领航员
    据新华社6日讯　中国海员工会代表王品三向埃及驻我国商务代表法尔表示全力支持埃及招聘外国领航人员到苏彝士运河去工作。
    王品三说：“中国海运虽然不发达，海运人才也不多，但是我们愿意尽力帮助你们。全国海员完全支持埃及人民将苏彝士运河公司收归国有这一正义斗争。”他对法尔说，自从招聘广告在各报刊载以来，已经有很多领航人员申请去埃及。
    法尔请王品三向中国海员们转达“最诚恳和深切的感谢”，他说，埃及感谢中国人民和政府的坚决和强有力的支持。他感到这种帮助特别可贵，因为中国在发展自己的航海事业中也非常需要领航人才。
    这位埃及商务代表介绍了应聘人的主要条件和手续。在回答关于领航人员是否可以携带家眷这个问题时，法尔说：“肯定可以，因为领航员的待遇很高。”
