    Procrastinating on Contradictions
    Ru Xiang
    Though my understanding of "On Contradiction" is not thorough and my grasp is not deep, I generally know that contradiction is objective and that people should grasp contradictions, analyze them, and resolve them. However, some people do not grasp contradictions in their work, analyze them, and actively seek solutions; instead, they like to procrastinate on contradictions. They procrastinate again and again, without truly holding onto the contradiction; in the end, they let the contradiction drag them down severely.
    How can this be seen? Some comrades have ideological problems, and the organization does not resolve them in a timely manner, but drags on with all sorts of reasons and excuses. As a result, the objectively existing problems continue to develop, and some even reach a point where the organization feels even more difficult to handle.
    The level of teachers is not high, and they cannot meet the needs of teaching. The problem is relatively complex, and it certainly cannot be solved all at once, but efforts should be made to gradually solve it in a more planned way. People with low levels will always be willing to improve themselves further.
    Cadres hope that their unit can provide them with a room to live in. This is not a difficult problem to solve: if it can be given, give it readily; if it is truly impossible to give, explain it properly, as long as it is done fairly and reasonably. However, some leaders prefer to procrastinate.
    Of course, those who like to procrastinate on contradictions may say, "There are too many things to do, I can't take care of them all!" "There are specific difficulties!" Some people may put on a stern face and say, "You can't ask for too much now, you have to be patient!" However, people are not asking to solve all the problems in one morning. But how long will we wait patiently?
    I have also heard such a saying: "The older the problem, the harder it is to solve." May I ask those who hold this view, why has the problem become an old problem? Although the problem is old, it is not necessarily difficult to solve.
    Theory must be linked to practice. Probably few people say that theory should be divorced from practice, and few people are willing to point at themselves and say, "I say one thing and do another." However, there is still a distance from theory to practice. Therefore, to use theory to guide our actions, we must rely on our subjective efforts.

    拖住矛盾
    如翔
    “矛盾论”读得不透，领会不深。但对矛盾的客观性和人们应该抓住矛盾，分析它，解决它，还算大体上是知道了的。然而有一些人，不是在工作中去抓住矛盾，分析它，并且积极地去想办法解决，而是爱拖住矛盾。他们拖来拖去，固然不曾把矛盾真个拖住；到头来，却让矛盾把自己拖得够呛。
    何以见得？有的同志，思想上有了问题，组织上没有及时加以解决，而以种种原因，万般理由拖下去。结果客观上存在的问题依然发展下去，甚至有的居然弄到组织上也觉得更不好处理了。
    师资水平不高，满足不了教学需要，问题比较复杂，固然不能一下子解决，但也应该更有计划地设法逐步解决才好。水平不高的人总不会不愿自己再提高一些。
    干部希望本单位能给一间房子住。这本来也不是怎么难解决的问题：能够给的就痛快地给，真正不可能给的就好好解释，只要做得公平合理就得了。然而有些领导人偏偏喜欢拖下去。
    当然，爱拖住矛盾的人或许会开口道：“事情太多，照顾不过来呀！”“有具体困难呀！”有的人也许板起面孔说：“现在不能要求过多，要耐心一些！”但是，人们并不要求在一个早上把所有的问题都解决。只是耐心等待，到底又等到何时？
    还听到过这样的说法：“越是老问题越不好解决”。试问持这种观点的人，问题为什么会成了老问题？问题虽老，也不见得就不好解决。
    理论必须联系实际。大概很少有人说理论应该脱离实际的，也很少有人愿意指着鼻子自我介绍说：“我，说的是一套，做的是另一套。”但是，从理论到实际究还有距离。因此，用理论来指导自己的行动，就要靠我们主观的努力。
