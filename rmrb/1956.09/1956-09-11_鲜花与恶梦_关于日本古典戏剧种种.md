	Flowers and Nightmares
	——On Various Aspects of Japanese Classical Drama——
	Mǎ Shǎobō

	Japanese classical drama possesses a long tradition and a rich heritage. During my visit to Japan, I watched many performances, and as someone encountering Japanese classical drama for the first time, I found everything fresh, simple, elegant, and unforgettable!

	The classical dramas, music, and dances preserved in Japan today can be roughly divided into several major categories: "Ancient Performing Arts," "Bugaku," "Sarugaku, Ennen, Dengaku," "Noh, Kyogen," "Ningyo Joruri," "Kabuki," "Edo Music," "Local Performing Arts," "Folk Songs," and "Street Performing Arts." The variety of categories and schools is too numerous to list.

	When I was with Japanese friends, they loved to talk about the cultural and historical relationship between the Chinese and Japanese people. Japanese classical drama was greatly influenced by ancient Chinese drama; Chinese modern drama was also influenced by Japanese drama. Japanese friends often say that this is a "historical romance" in the history of artistic exchange between the two countries.

	As early as 693 AD (the tenth year of Emperor Ruizong of Tang, the seventh year of Empress Jito of Japan), Chinese "Tagei dance" began to be introduced into Japan. According to Japanese friends, the Tang Dynasty introduced to Japan the "Daemyeon," "Ta Yao Niang," "Botou" and other classical dance programs that appeared in China during the late Northern and Southern Dynasties. The "Cangjun Opera," which was based on humorous questions and answers to satirize secular politics, was also introduced to Japan during the Tang Dynasty.

	The Japanese people absorbed foreign outstanding culture and quickly formed their own national special style. For example, "Noh" has a history of more than 600 years. It was created by the "Noh" founder Kan'ami and his son by absorbing Chinese "Gigaku" and developing it into "Sangaku," "Sarugaku," "Kagura," and "Dengaku," and integrating "Shirabyoshi" (female dance) and "Kouta" (folk tunes). There are five major schools of "Noh": "Kanze School," "Hosho School," "Kongo School," "Konparu School," and "Kita School" (in addition, there are "Umewaka School" and "Kurokawa School"). The famous actors of the "Kanze School," Kanze Kazuyuki and Kanze Hisao, performed the "Tenko" dance for us; the famous actor of the "Konparu School," Sakurama Yumikawa, and the famous actor of the "Hosho School," Hosho Kuro, performed the "U no Dan"; Kita Rokuheita, the only surviving veteran actor of the Kita School, and Kita Minoru, performed the "Hagoromo" dance. The main characters of "Noh" often wear masks, their movements are slow, and they emphasize deep emotions. The appearance is simple and has a unique Japanese national style.

	Since the early Edo period in Japan, that is, the fourth year of Genna (1618), the Tokugawa shogunate exclusively dedicated "Noh" to the feudal royal family, and it was restricted by the Iemoto system, which gradually solidified and stagnated in art. Young actors of the "Noh" generation, such as Goto Eio, are now committed to new reforms; we also saw the famous "Kyogen" Izumi school actors Nomura Manzo and Nomura Mannojo perform many excellent programs such as "Fukurou Yamabushi" and "Mizukake Muko." "Kyogen" was greatly influenced by the Chinese Tang Dynasty’s Cangjun Opera. When we study the history of ancient Chinese drama, the scripts and performances of Japanese "Noh" and "Kyogen" are important reference materials.

	What made us particularly excited was seeing the Bugaku "Ranryo-o". This program describes the story of Lanling Wang Chang Gong of the Northern and Southern Dynasties, who was brave and beautiful, and the enemy was not afraid of him, so he often wore a mask into battle to defeat the enemy. The Chinese "Lanling Wang" dance is the originator of the ancient Chinese "Daemyeon" dance, which is extremely precious. This time, seeing "Ranryo-o" in Japan allowed us to see the oldest style of "Daemyeon" dance, which is truly a grand event! According to Japanese friends, this dance has largely preserved its original appearance. The posture and hand gestures are simple and powerful, and the skill is very deep, even Li Shaochun found it a bit difficult to learn. The musicians also wore armor and knelt in accompaniment. The musical instruments include the sho, hichiriki, ryūteki, biwa, koto, taiko, kakko, and shoko. The melody is said to be "Tang Music" (the Japanese call ancient Chinese music Tang Music). Famous Bugaku pieces include "Ryoo," "Embu," "Harutoriten," "Kochou," "Manzairaku," "Engiraku," "Taiheiraku," "Seigaiha," "Dakyu-raku," "Genshoraku," "Bato," "Kondo Hassen," "Kotokuraku," "Gojoraku," "Etenraku," "Nasori," "Karyobin," "Ninomai," "Anma," "Bairo," "Hahakko," "Chokeishi," etc. We have heard some of them, and they are extremely beautiful and moving.

	We also saw many Kabuki programs, among which the play "Shunkan," starring Nakamura Ganjiemon of the Zenshinza Theater, was the most moving. This play depicts the story of an old man named Shunkan who was exiled to Kikai Island by the feudal rulers and sacrificed himself to help others. It has high ideological value. Ganjiemon's performance was praised by the whole audience. According to Ganjiemon, he lived in China for several years and seriously studied many strengths of Peking Opera performance techniques. He put a lot of effort into the musicality of the language, the rhythm of the movements, and other artistic means of expressing inner emotions.

	Japanese Kabuki developed from "Noh" and "Kyogen" after 1600 AD, and the founder was the female dancer Izumo no Okuni. Between 1600 and 1750, six major schools were formed: the Ichikawa Danjuro school, the Matsumoto Koshiro school, the Nakamura Utaemon school, the Onoe Kikugoro school, the Kataoka Nizaemon school, and the Ichikawa Sadanji school. Ichikawa Ennosuke is the contemporary master of the Ichikawa school.

	Kabuki plays are mainly divided into "Historical Plays," "Sewa Plays" (Edo period folk legend plays), and "Dance Dramas," each with a rich repertoire.

	There are many schools of dance, including the "Shigayama School," "Mizuki School," "Nishikawa School," "Shinozuka School," "Fujima School," "Ichiyama School," "Yamamura School," "Bando School," "Ichikawa School," "Nakamura School," "Matsumoto School," "Umemoto School," "Inoue School," "Hanayagi School," and "Wakayagi School." Edo music is divided into more than ten categories, including "Classical," "Nagauta," "Tomimoto," "Tokiwazu," "Shin-nai," "Juta," "Sokyoku," and "Shakuhachi." As for local performing arts, folk songs, and street performing arts, they cover a wide range of aspects, and the types and programs are very rich.

	Artistically, it also reflects the Japanese people's intelligent and hardworking creative spirit. Japanese classical drama art is so colorful. However, the Japanese art world, like the Japanese people across the country, is bearing the suffering of the nation. American culture is crawling into the flower garden of Japanese national art like a poisonous snake.

	There are more than 1,000 movie theaters in Tokyo, nearly half of which show American films that promote pornography, gambling, and colonialism, American-style yellow light dramas, operettas, and nude dances are staged in large numbers; while the larger theaters that can stage classical dramas are only the Kabuki-za, Meiji-za, and Shinbashi Enbujo. The flower of Japanese national art is withering day by day. The United States adopted a barbaric policy of suppression against Japanese traditional drama after the war, but recently, it has changed to another face, hypocritically pretending to be willing to protect Japanese classical drama, but what they praise is not the realism and popularity of Japanese classical drama, but the deformed development of its decadent side and superficial beauty, and they try every means to tempt the Japanese traditional drama world to embark on the road of promoting colonialism. Last autumn, the Kabuki play "Nihon Kenjo Ki" won the first prize at the Japan Arts Festival. The content of this play is: the Yamato and Izumo tribes have been fighting all the time. Finally, the Izumo tribe dedicated their land to the Yamato tribe, and there was no more fighting. Why did this play win the award! Conscientious Japanese people feel confused and ashamed.

	Due to the erosion of American culture and various man-made hardships, the Japanese traditional art world is in an extremely difficult situation.

	Under the monopoly and control of large capitalists, the Japanese theater world has been forced to perform a 25-day system and a two-part system day and night every month. Almost all theaters across the country perform two shows day and night. Actors usually have to prepare at 10:00 in the morning to go to the theater, and return home at 12:00 at night. Even famous actors such as Ichikawa Ennosuke, Nakamura Utaemon (VI), and Matsumoto Koshiro (VIII) often perform four shows a day (more than 100 shows a month). In July last year, Ichikawa Ennosuke even performed seven shows in a row in one day. They spend twenty-five days of each month day and night in such a muddled way. The remaining five days are neither for rest nor for rehearsal, because these five days are spent traveling.

	Such intense stage labor every day makes the actors exhausted and exhausted. Where do they have the time and extra energy to consider artistic creation and study! The struggle to abolish the two-part system has lasted for a long time, but to no avail, because the entertainment tax is 100% (the theater has no choice but to charge the audience half the ticket price more per ticket in addition to the stipulated ticket price for tax purposes). It is said that performing an extra show every day is for paying taxes; otherwise, the capitalists want to make money, and if they perform one less show every day, they will usually deduct half of their wages. If an actor is sick, wages are stopped according to the contract, and the actor must pay someone to replace him (major actors cannot be replaced by others). Some male actors who are unemployed go to the streets to become vendors or sell newspapers to maintain their lives, and even sell their own blood to "blood banks"; female actors are even more miserable if they cannot get a job for a while.

	Japanese artists love art and strive for progress. They are constantly worried and anxious about the significant decline in their artistic level. Playwrights and directors often argue with the person in charge to fight for a week of rehearsal time. In fact, even if this week is won, it is in vain, because there are still two performances every day during this week. Therefore, the so-called rehearsal is just a hasty "speaking" in groups of three or five in the rare gaps between the two performances every day. An old playwright sighed: "Many of our actors, due to the pressure of life and the lack of conditions for further study, not to mention the improvement of performance skills and skills, they simply don't even have the strength to speak. The audience can hardly hear the actor's voice when watching the play, and even if they hear it, they don't understand what they are saying, because the play has not been rehearsed well, and the words have not been memorized well, so they have to talk nonsense on stage. The remaining actors cannot improve, there is no successor, the art cannot be developed, it's like a nightmare, Japanese drama has now hit a wall!"

	Japanese drama art is as fragrant as a flower, but its situation is as terrifying as a nightmare; but people firmly believe that this wall in front of Japanese artists will eventually be removed, and there is no nightmare that will not wake up. No country can cut off another country's own national traditions; no country can impose its own culture on others; the culture and art of the people of any country have a glorious past and will inevitably have an even more glorious future.

    鲜花与恶梦
    ——关于日本古典戏剧种种——
    马少波
    日本古典戏剧具有悠久的传统和丰富的遗产。我们这次访日，观赏了许多节目，对于初次接触日本古典戏剧的我说来，一切都觉得十分新鲜，古朴优美，难以忘怀！
    日本现在保存下来的古典戏剧、音乐、舞蹈，大体上可分“古代艺能”、“舞乐”、“猿乐、延年、田乐”、“能乐、能狂言”、“人形净琉璃”、“歌舞伎”、“江户音乐”、“乡土艺能”、“民谣”、“巷间艺能”等几大类，各类名目、流派之丰富，不胜枚举。
    和日本朋友在一起的时候，他们顶喜欢谈起中日两国人民的文化历史关系。日本的古典戏剧受过中国古代戏剧很大的影响；中国近代的话剧也受过日本话剧很大的影响。日本朋友常说这在两国戏剧艺术交流史上真是“千古佳话”。
    远在纪元693年（唐嗣圣十年、日持统女皇七年），中国的“踏歌之技”开始传入日本。据日本朋友谈：唐代传入日本的正是中国南北朝末期出现的“代面”、“踏摇娘”、“拨头”等古典舞蹈节目，而且唐代以滑稽问答为主讽刺世俗朝政的“参军戏”，也在唐朝传入了日本。
    日本人民吸收了外国的优秀文化，很快就形成自己民族的特殊风格。例如“能乐”已有六百多年的历史了，这是“能乐”鼻祖观阿弥父子在吸收了中国“伎乐”发展成“散乐”、“猿乐”、“曲乐”、“田乐”，并综合“白拍子”（女跳）、“小呗”（民间小调）而创成的。“能乐”派系共有“观世流”、“宝生流”、“金刚流”、“金春流”、“喜多流”五个大流派（此外还有“梅若派”和“黑川流”两种）。这次“观世流”著名演员观世华雪、观世寿夫为我们表演了“天鼓”舞；“金春流”著名演员樱间弓川和“宝生流”著名演员宝生九郎为我们表演了“鹈之段”；喜多流硕果仅存的元老演员喜多六平太和喜多实等为我们表演了“羽衣”舞。“能乐”主要角色往往戴面具，动作滞缓，讲究感情深藏，样子很古朴，有独特的日本民族风格。
     “能乐”自从日本江户时代初期，也就是元和四年（1618年）德川幕府把它专为封建皇室供奉，加以受家元制度的束缚，在艺术上日趋凝固，陷于停滞。“能乐”青年一辈的演员如后藤荣夫等人现正致力于新的改革；我们也看到了“狂言”和泉流名演员野村万藏、野村万之亟等为我们演出的“枭山伏”、“水挂聟”等许多优秀节目。“狂言”受中国唐代参军戏的影响很大。我们研究中国古代戏剧史，日本的“能乐”、“狂言”的剧本和表演都是重要的参考资料。
    特别使我们兴奋的是看到了舞乐“兰陵王”。这一节目是描写南北朝兰陵王长恭，勇武貌美，敌人不惧，因而常戴面具入阵破敌的故事。中国的“兰陵王”舞，为我国古代“代面”舞的开山鼻祖，是极珍贵的。这次在日本看到“兰陵王”，使我们看到“代面”舞的最古风范，实在是盛事！据日本朋友说，此舞大体上保存了原样，身段、手式古朴有力，功夫很深，连李少春学起来都有些吃力。乐师们也都着盔甲，跪列伴奏。乐器为笙、筚篥、龙笛、琵琶、筝、太鼓、鞨鼓、钲鼓等，曲调据说也是“唐乐”（日人称中国古乐叫唐乐）。舞乐的曲目著名的有“陵王”、“振鉾”、“春莺啭”、“胡蝶”、“万岁乐”、“延喜乐”、“太平乐”、“青海波”、“打球乐”、“还城乐”、“拨头”、“昆仑八仙”、“胡德乐”、“五常乐”、“越天乐”、“纳苏利”、“迦陵频”、“二之舞”、“安摩”、“陪胪”、“拍桙”、“长庆子”等曲。我们听到过一些，是极优美动听的。
    我们也看到许多歌舞伎的节目，其中以前进座中村玩右卫门主演的“俊宽”一剧最为动人。此剧是描写一个被封建统治者流放在鬼界岛上名叫俊宽的老人，牺牲自己成全别人的故事，思想性很高。玩右卫门的表演得到全场赞赏。据玩右卫门说，他在中国住了几年，认真地学习了京剧表演技巧的许多长处，他对语言的音乐性、动作的节奏感以及其他表现内心感情的艺术手段，很下了一番功夫。
    日本歌舞伎是公元1600年后在“能乐”、“能狂言”的基础上发展起来的，创始人是女舞蹈家出云阿国。在1600——1750年间形成了六大派系：市川团十郎系，松本幸四郎系，中村歌右卫门系，尾上菊五郎系，片冈仁左卫门系，市川左团次系。市川猿之助就是市川系的当代名家。
    歌舞伎剧目主要的分为“历史物”（历史剧）、“世话物”（江户时代民间传说剧）、“舞蹈剧”等类，各类都有丰富的剧目。
    舞踊流派繁多，计有“志贺山流”、“水木流”、“西川流”、“筱冢流”、“藤间流”、“市山流”、“山村流”、“坂东流”、“市川流”、“中村流”、“松本流”、“梅茂都流”、“井上流”、“花柳流”、“若柳流”等各大流派；江户音乐则分“古典”、“长呗”、“富本”、“常磐津”、“新内”、“地呗”、“筝曲”、“尺八”等十余大类。至于乡土艺能、民谣、巷间艺能所包括的方面很广，种类和节目都很丰富。
    从艺术上，同样反映出日本人民聪明勤劳的创造精神，日本古典戏剧艺术是如此的多色多彩。但是现在日本艺术界和日本全国人民一样地承担着民族的苦难，美国文化正像毒蛇一样地爬进了日本民族艺术的花圃。
    东京有一千多个电影院，其中近半数上演诲淫诲盗宣传殖民主义的美国影片、美国式的黄色轻戏剧、轻歌剧、裸体舞大量上演；而可以上演古典剧的较大剧院只有歌舞伎座、明治座、新桥演舞场三处。日本民族艺术之花日见枯萎了。美国在战后曾对日本传统戏剧采取了蛮横的镇压政策，近来，却又换了另外一幅面孔，假惺惺地装成似乎愿意保护日本古典戏剧的样子，但是他们赞美的不是日本古典戏剧的现实主义和人民性，而是畸形地发展它颓废的一面和外表的美，并千方百计地诱惑日本传统戏剧界走上宣扬殖民主义的道路。去年秋天，日本艺术节评选，歌舞伎“日本献上记”一剧竟获一等奖。这剧的内容是：大和族和出云族一直在打架，最后，出云族把国土献给了大和族，从此便无争了。为什么这个剧得奖呢！有良心的日本人都感到惶惑和羞耻。
    由于美国文化的侵蚀以及种种人为的磨难，日本传统艺术界正处于极其困难的境地。
    日本戏剧界在大资本家的垄断和控制下，一直在被迫履行着每月演出二十五天制和每天昼夜两部制。几乎是全国所有的剧团都是昼夜演出两场，演员照例从早十时就要准备到剧场上戏，夜十二时回家，即使是像市川猿之助、中村歌右卫门（六世）、松本幸四郎（八世）等著名演员，也经常每天演出四出（每月要演一百多出戏）。去年7月，有一次市川猿之助在一天之中竟连续演出了七出戏。这样每个月日日夜夜浑浑噩噩地度过二十五天，剩下来五天既不能休息，也不能排戏，因为这五天正奔波在旅途之中。
    每天如此紧张的舞台劳动，使得演员们心枯力竭，疲惫不堪，哪里还有时间和多余的精力去考虑一下艺术的创造和进修！取消二部制的斗争持续了好久，但是毫无结果，因为娱乐税要征百分之百，（剧团无奈在征税的规定票价之外，每张票向观众多收一半票钱）据说每天多演一场是为了缴税；另则资本家要赚钱，每天如果少演一场，照例扣一半工资。演员病了，按合同停发工资，还须演员自己出钱请人代替（主要演员别人还代替不了）。男演员失业了有的上街当小贩、卖报来维持生活，甚至到“血液银行”出卖自己的鲜血；女演员如果一时搭不上班，景况更为凄惨。
    日本艺术家是热爱艺术的，是努力进取的，他们无时不在为自己的艺术水平显著地降低而忧虑，而焦急。剧作家、导演往往为了争取一个星期的排戏时间和管事人发生争吵，其实即使这一周时间争得到，也是一场空，因为这一周中仍然是每天两场演出的。因此，所谓排戏，只是在每天两场演出的稀有的空隙中每三、五人一组草草地“对对说说”而已。有一位老戏剧家这样慨叹：“我们不少的演员由于生活的重压，由于缺乏进修的条件，不要说表演的技巧和功夫提不高了，简直连口劲儿都没有了，观众看戏有时简直听不见演员的声音，即使听见了也不懂说的是什么，因为戏没有排好，词没有背熟，到台上只好乱说。仅存的演员无法提高，后继无人，艺术得不到发展，恶梦一样啊，日本戏现在碰到墙上了！”
    日本的戏剧艺术像花一样的芬芳，处境却像恶梦般的张惶；但是人们坚信：日本艺术家面前的这堵墙终有一天会被移开的，世上哪有不醒的恶梦呢。任何一个国家不可能切断另一个国家自己的民族传统；任何一个国家不可能把自己的文化强加在别人的头上；任何一个国家人民的文化艺术既有它光辉的过去，也必然有它自己更光辉的将来。　1956年9月
