Electronics, as discussed here, is used in a broad sense, encompassing radio technology, electronic physics, and communications technology. Due to its wide scope, this discussion will be limited to the content and characteristics of electronics.

Radio technology and electronic physics were two newly opened scientific fields at the end of the nineteenth century. Initially, they developed independently. In the early twentieth century, they combined, and their relationship has become increasingly close since then. Modern radio technology and telecommunications technology cannot function without various electronic devices, and achievements in electronic physics research and work are impossible without the use of radio technology. Especially in various applications, radio technology and electronics are always combined, so we can regard them as one discipline. It promotes technological innovation in culture, education, national defense, and all aspects of the national economy. Electronics also occupies a very important position in the research and application of atomic energy. That is why we call the present era the era of atomic energy and electronics.

Physicist Maxwell theoretically proved the nature of electromagnetic waves, Hertz experimentally proved their existence, and Popov first used electromagnetic waves for communication. This is the origin of radio. The earliest radio receivers used metal powder detectors, which were neither sensitive nor reliable. Without the application of electronics, radio would never have achieved its current development.

We can regard the research on electrical conductivity in rarefied gases in the 1880s, especially Thomson's research on electrons in the 1890s, as the starting period of electronic physics. Adding an electrode to a light bulb forms a so-called diode. In a diode, electricity can only flow from the electrode to the filament, not in the reverse direction. This was known at the end of the nineteenth century. However, it was not until 1904 that Fleming first suggested using it in radio receivers to replace metal powder detectors. This was the beginning of the combination of electronic physics and radio. In 1907, De Forest added a grid electrode (now called the gate) between the two electrodes mentioned above, forming a triode. The emergence of the triode had an even greater impact on radio. It could be used not only as a detector, replacing the simple diode, but more importantly, it could be used for amplification and many other functions. By 1914, triodes were widely used in long-distance telephone calls, and in 1915, wireless telephone calls using triodes reached 8,000 kilometers away. Subsequent developments have been rapid, and applications are endless.

What is electronics? It is difficult to give a definition. Therefore, we will only talk about what problems are mainly studied in electronics.

In electronic physics, it is necessary to study electron emission, electron motion, gas conduction, semiconductor electronic devices, and various electron tubes.

The situation is simplest and control is easiest when electrons exist in free space. General electron tubes must first obtain free electrons. This is the problem of electron emission. Metals or other substances can be heated to release electrons, or free electrons can be generated by light irradiation, electron or ion bombardment, or an external electric field. In fact, electron emission was a problem studied from the beginning of electronic physics at the end of the nineteenth century, and it has seen considerable development in recent years.

After obtaining free electrons, it is certainly necessary to study their motion in static or changing electric and magnetic fields. During the movement, electrons can either gain energy from the field or give their energy to the field. For example, various accelerators in nuclear physics research are devices that allow electrons or ions to obtain energy in alternating magnetic and electric fields. A special case of electron motion is making electrons into beams. People have found that the motion of electrons in fields is very similar to their motion in various media, so a part of electronics is called electron and ion optics. It has many uses, and the electron microscope is one of them.

Gas discharge is also one of the earliest areas of study in electronics. Due to its complexity, our understanding of it is far less than we would like. It seems that achieving atomic energy from light-mass atoms is likely to require the use of plasma discharge. Therefore, this is a problem that has been vigorously studied recently. The study of gas discharge is also the basis for various ion tubes.

Semiconductor physics studies the movement of electrons in solids. This part also falls within the scope of electronic physics research. Recently, semiconductor physics has developed rapidly and has become a separate discipline. However, electronic devices made of semiconductors, also called transistors, especially semiconductor electronic circuits combined with other components, still need to be studied in electronics, Semiconductor electronic devices will have great development and replace some electron tubes, although currently the frequency they can use is still low and the power is small.

Diodes and triodes have already been mentioned above. The reason why triodes are important and have promoted revolutionary and leap-forward progress in radio is because they have amplification performance, their response is extremely agile, distortion is very small, and sensitivity is very high. Mechanical, optical, and any other form of amplifier cannot be compared with the amplification of electron tubes. Since then, tetrodes, pentodes, and many other types of electron tubes have been developed for different purposes, some smaller than a small finger, some larger than a person, some very energy-saving, and some that can generate megawatts of power. Ion tubes are gas-filled electron tubes. They are good static electrical switches. Their action is very agile, sometimes as fast as a few millionths of a second. The current it can control can also be as high as several thousand amperes. Electron beam tubes are very different in construction from ordinary electron tubes. It uses the principle of electron optics to form electrons into beams and deflect them to hit a fluorescent screen to make the latter emit light. Television, radar, and oscilloscopes all use it. In addition, X-ray tubes, various lighting lamps, photoelectric tubes, television camera tubes, memory tubes used in computers, various high-speed switching tubes, etc., are also studied in electronic physics.

Combining electron tubes with some components, such as resistors, capacitors, coils, transformers, etc., forms electronic circuits. Obviously, there are very many possibilities for this combination. We can classify electronic circuits into the following types according to their functions: amplifiers, oscillators, modulators, keyers, counters, etc. Electron tube amplifiers can amplify tiny direct current currents (a hundred millionth of an ampere) so that they can be read with an ordinary electric meter, and they can also amplify radio waves with frequencies as high as tens of millions of times per second and powers as high as tens of thousands of watts. Electron tube oscillators can generate various waveforms, such as rectangular, sawtooth, pulse, sine, etc., and frequencies ranging from near direct current to hundreds of billions of cycles per second. Making a radio wave change according to another wave is called modulation. For example, the radio wave of a broadcast transmitter must change with the music being broadcast, so the broadcast machine uses a modulator. Keying means an electrical switch. The characteristic of switches made with electronic circuits is that they are fast, up to tens of thousands of times per second. Counters are used a lot in atomic energy and computers.

At very high frequencies, general capacitors and circuits are no longer suitable. At this time, resonant cavities (hollow metal boxes), coaxial transmission lines, etc. can be used instead. The transmission of such high-frequency radio waves cannot use general transmission lines, but must use coaxial lines or waveguides (hollow metal tubes). Generating such high-frequency radio waves (equivalent to wavelengths of centimeters and millimeters) and various electronic circuits formed with waveguides, resonant cavities, etc., and the long-distance transmission of radio waves through waveguides are the focus of modern electronics research.

In addition, electronics must also study how to effectively and directionally transmit electromagnetic waves. This is the research on various antennas. We also need to study how electromagnetic waves propagate along the ground and in the atmosphere, and how the ionosphere or troposphere of the sky attenuates, reflects, or scatters radio waves of various wavelengths.

Various basic circuits with different functions can be combined into ever-changing and wonderfully effective equipment and systems. These systems can be used in many aspects of the national economy, culture, and national defense, such as various wireless communications, multi-channel relay telecommunications, long-distance waveguide multi-channel telecommunications, broadcasting, telex, television, radar, orientation, navigation, automatic control, rocket control, electronic computers, high-frequency heating, various electronic instruments, etc. Due to the development of new wavebands (mainly towards millimeter waves), new materials, new components, and new manufacturing processes, these applications are still rapidly expanding.

The widespread and wonderful use of electronics is due to the characteristics of electronics itself. We will see that these characteristics are beyond the reach of any other method. First, its action is particularly agile. The propagation speed of electromagnetic waves is 300,000 kilometers per second. Electrons in an electron tube can accelerate to 10,000 kilometers per second in one billionth of a second. Second, electromagnetic waves can transcend space. Therefore, there is no need for physical connections between transmitting and receiving stations. For example, only radio can be used to control rockets. Third, it is particularly sensitive. The amplification mentioned above is an example. Fourth, it is very precise. For example, an atomic clock can be accurate to one hundred billionth. Calculated at this accuracy, it would only be one second off in three thousand years. Also, using electronic methods to measure, the distance between two points tens of kilometers apart can be measured, and the error will not exceed tens of centimeters. Fifth, electronic measurement methods are versatile. It is only necessary to convert the physical quantity to be measured into an electrical signal using a transducer, and then the following process is the same as measuring an electrical quantity. Microphones can turn sound into electricity, photoelectric tubes can turn light intensity or color into electricity, piezoelectric wafers can turn pressure into electricity; in addition, temperature, tension, humidity, acidity, and any quantity can be converted into electricity, and then amplified, observed, measured, or used. The amplified information is reversed for automatic control.

From the above main features, it can be known that the application of electronics is endless. We can further say that any research laboratory or any production process that has not yet adopted electronic methods must be backward.

The entire history of electronics is only more than sixty years, but it has become an indispensable thing for modern communications, industry, people's cultural life, national defense, and scientific research. It is still developing rapidly and its applications are increasing day by day. All countries in the world attach great importance to it and vigorously study it. However, this is a very weak discipline for us. Therefore, we must catch up quickly, train talents, develop the radio electronics industry, and strengthen research on electronics.

    标志着现时代的一种技术科学——电子学
    中国科学院技术科学学部委员　孟昭英
    这里要讲的电子学是广义的，它包括无线电技术、电子物理学和通信技术。由于它的范围是比较多方面的，这里只能谈一谈电子学的内容和特性。
    无线电技术和电子物理学是十九世纪末叶新开辟的两个科学园地。最初它们独立地发展着。在二十世纪初年，它们结合在一起，以后这两门学科的关系愈来愈密切。现代的无线电技术和电信技术不可能不使用各式各样的电子器件，而在电子物理学的工作和研究里，如果不用无线电技术也不可能得到成就。特别是在各种应用里，无线电技术和电子学永远是结合在一起的，因此我们可以把它们看作一个学科。它促进了文化、教育、国防和整个国民经济各方面的技术革新。在原子能的研究和应用里，电子学也占很重要的地位。因此我们才称现时代为原子能和电子学时代。
    物理学家麦克士韦从理论上证明了电磁波的性质，赫兹用实验方法证明了它的存在，而波波夫第一次用电磁波进行了通信。这便是无线电的起源。在这最原始的无线电接收机里使用的是金属粉末检波器。它既不灵敏，又很不可靠。假如不应用电子学，无线电绝不可能有今天这样的发展。
    我们可以把十九世纪八十年代关于稀薄气体里的导电现象的研究，特别是把九十年代汤姆孙关于电子的研究工作看成电子物理学的起始时期。在一个电灯泡里再装上一个电极就形成所谓二极管。在二极管里只能从这电极向灯丝通电，不能反向通电。这是在十九世纪末就知道的了。可是一直到1904年夫累铭才第一次建议把它用在无线电接收机里代替金属粉末检波器。这就是电子物理学和无线电结合的开始。1907年德福雷斯在上述两极之间又加了一个栅状电极（现称栅极），就形成了三极管。三极管的出现对于无线电的影响就更大了。它不仅可以用作检波器，代替那简单的二极管，更重要的是能用它来放大和作许多其他的功用。到1914年三极管就大量用在长途电话里，而在1915年用三极管的无线电话就通到八千公里以外了。这以后的发展更是一日千里，而应用也是无穷无尽的。
    电子学是什么？下一个定义是很难的。因此我们这里只谈一谈在电子学里主要是研究一些什么问题。
    在电子物理学里要研究电子发射、电子运动、气体导电、半导体电子器件和各种的电子管等问题。
    当电子在自由空间存在时，情形最简单，控制也最容易。一般的电子管都要首先得到自由电子。这就是电子发射的问题。可以把金属或其他物质加热使它放出电子，也可以靠光的照射、电子或离子的轰击或外加的电场发生自由电子。实际上，电子发射是十九世纪末叶电子物理学起始就研究的问题，近年来又有相当大的发展。
    得到自由电子以后当然还要研究它在静的或变化的电场和磁场里的运动。在运动的过程中，电子既可以从场里得到能量，也可以把它已得的能量给与场。例如核子物理研究里的各种加速器就都是使电子或离子在交变磁场和电场里得到能量的装置。电子运动的一个特殊情形是使电子成束。人们发现电子在场里的运动同先在各种媒质里的运动很相似，因此电子学的一部分就叫电子和离子光学。它的用途很多，电子显微镜是其中的一个。
    气体放电也是电子学最早就研究的。由于它的复杂性，我们对它的了解还远少于我们所希望的。看来实现从轻质量原子得到原子能很可能要利用等离子区放电。所以这是近来大力研究的一个问题。气体放电的研究也是各种离子管的基础。
    半导体物理学中要研究电子在固体里的运动。这一部分也属于电子物理学的研究范围。近来半导体物理发展得很快，已经另外形成了一个单独的学科。不过用半导体做的电子器件，又叫晶体管，特别是同其他元件合在一起组成的半导体电子线路仍要在电子学里研究。半导体电子器件将有很大的发展，并且代替某些电子管。虽然目前它能使用的频率还低，功率也小。
    以上已经提到了二极管和三极管。三极管之所以重要和它促使无线电发生了革命性的飞跃性的前进，是因为它具有放大的性能，它的响应极其敏捷，失真很小而灵敏度非常高。机械的、光的和任何其他形式的放大器都不能同电子管的放大相比。这以后为不同的用途又发展了四极管、五极管和许多其他种的电子管，有的小于一节小手指，有的大得比人还高，有的很省电，有的可以发生兆瓦的功率。离子管是充气的电子管。它是很好的无动件的电的开关。它的动作非常敏捷，有时快到几百万分之一秒。它能控制的电流也可以大到几千安培。电子束管在构造上和普通电子管很不相同。它利用电子光学的原理使电子成束，并使这束受到偏转然后打在萤光幕使后者发光。电视、雷达和示波器里都要用它。此外如爱克司光管、各种照明灯、光电管、摄电视用的析像管、计算机里用的记忆管、各种高速开关管，等等，也都是电子物理学里要研究的。
    把电子管和一些元件，如电阻、电容器、线圈、变压器等，组合在一起就形成电子线路。很显然，这种组合的可能是非常多的。我们可以按照功用把电子线路分为以下的几种：放大器、振荡器、调制器、键控器、计数器等。电子管放大器既可以把微小的直流电流（千万亿分之一安培）放大到用普通电表读出来，也可以放大频率高到每秒几千万次，功率高到几万瓦的电波。电子管振荡器可以发生各种各样的波形，如矩形、锯齿形、脉冲形、正弦形等，和低到近于直流和高到每秒交变几千亿次的频率。使一个电波按照另外一个波发生变化叫调制。例如广播发送机的电波要随着广播的音乐发生变化，所以广播机里要用调制器。键控是电开关的意思。用电子线路作的开关的特点是快，可达每秒几万次。计数器在原子能和计算机里用的很多。
    在非常高的频率，一般的电容器和线路等就不适用了。这时可以用谐振腔（中空的金属盒）、同轴传输线等代替。这样高频率电波的传输也不能用一般的传输线，必须用同轴线或波导（中空的金属管）。发生这样高频率的电波（相当于波长为厘米和毫米）和用波导、谐振腔等形成的各种电子线路和电波经过波导的长距离传输正是现代电子学研究的重点。
    此外，在电子学里还要研究如何有效地和按照一定的方向性把电磁波发射出去。这就是关于各种天线的研究。我们还要研究电磁波如何沿着地面和在大气里传播，天空的电离层或对流层如何对各种波长的电波发生衰减、反射或散射等问题。
    用功用不同的各种基本线路可以组合为千变万化、功效奇妙的各种设备和系统。这些系统可以用于国民经济、文化和国防的许多方面，如各种无线通信、多路接力电信、长途波导多路电信、广播、电传、电视、雷达、定向、导航、自动控制、火箭控制、电子计算机、高频加热、各种电子仪器等。由于新波段（主要是向毫米波）的开发，新材料、新元件和新制造工艺的进展，这些应用还正在迅速地扩大。
    电子学用途这样广泛和奇妙，是由于电子学本身的特征造成的。我们将看出这些特征是任何其他方法所望尘莫及的。第一，它的作用特别敏捷。电磁波的传播速度是每秒三十万公里。电子在电子管里可以在十亿分之一秒里加速到每秒一万公里。第二，电磁波可以超越空间。因此收发站之间不需要实体物质的联系。例如只有利用无线电才能控制火箭。第三，特别灵敏。上面举的放大就是一例。第四，非常精确。例如原子钟可以精确到一千亿分之一。按这精确度计算，要三千年才差一秒。又如用电子学的方法测量，可以把被测的量出相距几十公里的两点间的距离，误差不会超过几十厘米。第五，电子学测量方法是万能的。只需要把待量的物理量用一个变换器变成电的信号后，以下的过程就和测电量相同了。传声器能把声音变成电，光电管可以把光的强度或颜色变成电，压电晶片可以把压强变成电；此外如温度、张力、湿度、酸度以及任何量都可以变换成电，然后放大、观测、量度或再用这放大了的信息反向去进行自动控制。
    从以上的几个主要特点看来，可以知道电子学的应用是无穷无尽的。我们可以进一步说，任何一个研究实验室里或任何一种生产过程里如果还没有采用电子学的方法，它必定是落后的。
    电子学的全部历史不过六十多年，可是它对于现代通信、工业、人民文化生活、国防和科学研究到处成为不能缺少的东西，它仍在迅速地发展而它的应用也是与日俱增。世界各国对它都十分重视和大力加以研究。但是，这却是我们的非常薄弱的一个学科。因此必须急起直追，培养人才，发展无线电电子学工业和加强对电子学的研究。
