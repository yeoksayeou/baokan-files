Yunnan Province, September 11th (report from our newspaper) - Fifty-two counties in Yunnan Province have already begun the autumn harvest. In Simao and Mengzi prefectures, where harvesting started earlier, over 30% has already been harvested. In a few counties within Mengzi, Lincang, and Yuxi prefectures, the autumn harvest will commence fully in mid-to-late September. The entire province will enter a busy harvesting phase from late September to early October.

In response to the characteristics of this year's abundant and early-harvested early rice due to collectivization throughout the province, as well as concentrated maturity and harvesting times, and the resulting shortage of manpower, most areas are currently actively preparing for the autumn harvest and planting in terms of ideology, organization, and materials.

During the autumn harvest, Mengzi and Simao prefectures have established temporary specialized teams based on the amount of work, mainly using labor to carry out various tasks. Jinggu County has created wooden grain winnowing machines, increasing work efficiency by 100%. In Puer County, the Patriotic Agricultural Cooperative is using wooden boats to transport grain instead of people, increasing work efficiency by about tenfold and greatly saving labor. Since the beginning of the autumn harvest, the Liaoyuan Cooperative has created six or seven advanced technologies within half a month, significantly improving work efficiency. Farmers in various regions also emphasize the use of animal power to replace human labor.

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, September 11th - More than 12 million mu of double-cropping late rice are growing well in Hunan Province. In the main double-cropping rice production areas in the Dongting Lake area and the Xiangjiang River basin, most of the fields have been cultivated, weeded once or twice, and more than 8 million mu have been top-dressed with fertilizer. Currently, the late rice seedlings are one or two chi tall and are generally starting to "round their feet" and form buds.

According to the head of the Hunan Provincial Agricultural Department: This year, the planting area of late rice in Hunan has more than doubled compared to last year, and all regions have emphasized field management during this period and have continuously overcome insect and drought disasters. In previous years, the yield of late rice in Hunan was lower than or lost compared to early rice, mainly due to untimely transplanting and insufficient fertilizer. This year's situation is different. Late rice is generally transplanted before the Beginning of Autumn (Liqiu), about half a month earlier than in previous years. Many places have also launched fertilizer accumulation campaigns and increased the application of panicle fertilizer, thus ensuring the growth and early maturity of late rice. Currently, in well-known double-cropping rice producing counties such as Liling, the yield of late rice will be higher than that of early rice; the earlier planted late rice has already begun to head. In the Dongting Lake area, most of the more than 300 mu of late rice in the Qianfeng Agricultural Cooperative of Huarong County have already formed buds and headed.

    云南五十二个县开始秋收
    湖南一千多万亩晚稻长得好
    本报昆明11日电　云南省有五十二个县已经开始秋收。收割较早的思茅、蒙自两专区已收了30％以上；蒙自、临沧、玉溪等专区的少数县，在9月中下旬，秋收即将全面开始。从9月下旬到10月初，全省即进入紧张的收割阶段。
    针对今年全省合作化以后早稻种得多和收得早，成熟和收割时间集中，活计和劳动力紧张等特点，
  目前，大部分地区，正在从思想上、组织上及物质上积极进行秋收秋种的准备。
    在秋收中，蒙自、思茅两专区按活计多少，以劳动力为主成立了临时专业小组，分别进行各项工作。景谷县创造了木制扬谷机，使工作效率提高一倍，普洱县爱国农业社用木船代替人送谷子，提高工作效率十倍左右，大大地节省了劳动力；燎原合作社自秋收开始以来，在半个月内就创造了六、七种先进技术，工作效率有了显著提高。各地农民还重视使用畜力来代替人力进行工作。
    新华社长沙11日电　湖南省一千二百多万亩双季晚稻生长良好。在洞庭湖滨地区和湘江流域一带的双季稻主要产区，大部分已进行过中耕，除过一、两次草，并有八百多万亩施了追肥。现在，晚稻禾苗已有一、两尺高，普遍开始圆脚孕苞。
    据湖南省农业部门的负责人谈：今年湖南晚稻种植面积比去年扩大一倍多，各地在这一时期都重视了田间管理，又连续战胜了虫、旱灾害。往年，湖南晚稻产量比早稻低或失收，主要原因是插秧不及时和肥料不足所致。今年的情况就不同了，晚稻一般都在立秋前就插了秧，比往年要提早半月左右的时间，许多地方还开展了积肥运动，增施穗肥，因此，保证了晚稻的生长和提前成熟。目前，著名的双季稻产区醴陵等县，晚稻产量将要高于早稻产量；种得较早的晚稻，现已开始抽穗。洞庭湖区的华容县前锋农业社三百多亩晚稻，大部分已孕苞抽穗了。
