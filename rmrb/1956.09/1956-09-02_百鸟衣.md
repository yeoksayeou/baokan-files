    “Hundred Birds Garment”
    Zaor

    The Zhuang ethnic youth poet Wei Qilin, in his epic poem "Hundred Birds Garment," wrote the following story: The beautiful maiden Yili was snatched away by a chieftain. The brave Guka shot a hundred birds and sewed them into a dazzling hundred birds garment. He deceived the foolish chieftain and rescued Yili.

    This kind of hundred birds garment, in real life, we have never seen. But another kind of hundred birds garment, we have seen, and quite a few. Here, I am not talking about clothes that can shield the body from the cold, but books.

    Writing books and articles cannot be without necessary citations. But the number of quotations in some treatises is truly astonishing, while the author's own opinions are very few. It seems that there are tricks to writing articles. To write literary theory, one opens "Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin on Literature and Art," "Marxism and Literature and Art." To write articles on socialist industrialization, one opens "Lenin on Industrialization," "Stalin on Industrialization." To write articles on agricultural collectivization, one opens "Lenin on the Path of Socialist Transformation of Agriculture," "Stalin on the Path of Socialist Transformation of Agriculture." Thus, one finds arguments for arguments, and viewpoints for viewpoints. Copying and quoting, cutting and pasting, a majestic work is completed. And one need not worry at all about others' criticisms. For example, there is a book studying Lu Xun and other works. Upon opening it, whether in long lines or short lines, large characters or small characters, from beginning to end, it is full of citations. A treatise of hundreds of thousands of words, a large part of it belongs to others. Again, for example, there is such a book on state capitalism, where quotations are marked with quotation marks, and even those without quotation marks are still quoted from other works and documents. The author's effort is merely to sew the hunted fragments into a hundred birds garment.

    Now, the Party Central Committee is calling for "a hundred schools of thought contend" in academia. Although some books were written or published before this, one cannot help but have such worries: If our scholars only care about weaving "hundred birds garments," dancing in "hundred birds garments," then where can we go to hear the "contending" voices!

    The epic poem "Hundred Birds Garment" says that wearing a hundred birds garment can make an old man as handsome as a young man, and girls will laugh when they see him. However, Guka's hundred birds garment can only deceive a fool like the chieftain. The modern imitators of Guka, trying to deceive the eyes of the broad masses of readers with it, will ultimately fail.

    “百鸟衣”
    早而
    僮族青年诗人韦其麟，在他的长诗“百鸟衣”里，写了这样一个故事：美丽的姑娘依娌被土司抢去了，勇敢的古卡射了一百只鸟，缝成一件亮闪闪的百鸟衣，蒙骗了愚蠢的土司，救走了依娌。
    这种百鸟衣，在现实生活里，我们不曾见过。可是，另外一种百鸟衣，我们是见过的，而且还不少。在这里，我说的不是可以蔽体御寒的衣服，而是书。
    著书写文章，不能没有必要的引证。但是有些论著的引语之多，真是惊人，而作者自己的意见却少得很。看来，写文章也是有窍门可找的。要写文艺理论，便打开“马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林论文艺”，“马克思主义与文艺”。要写社会主义工业化的文章，便打开“列宁论工业化”，“斯大林论工业化”。要写农业合作化的文章，便打开“列宁论农业社会主义改造的道路”，“斯大林论农业社会主义改造的道路”。于是，找论据有论据，找观点有观点，抄抄引引，剪剪贴贴，皇皇大著，就此告成。而且还可以完全不用担心别人的评驳。例如，有一本研究鲁迅及其他作品的书，打开一看，高行低行，大字小字，从头到尾，满是引证。数十万字的一本论著，很大一部分是别人的。又如，有这样一本谈国家资本主义的书，加引号的固然是引证，不加引号的也还是从别的著作和文件中引来的。作者所下的工夫，只不过是把猎获的片麟只羽，缝纳成百鸟衣而已。
    现在，党中央号召在学术上要做到“百家争鸣”。有些书虽然都是在这以前写成或出版的，但仍不能不使人有这样的忧虑：如果我们的学者们只顾编织“百鸟衣”，披着“百鸟衣”跳舞，那么让我们到那里去听“鸣”声呢！
    长诗“百鸟衣”里说，穿了百鸟衣，能使老头变得后生一样俊俏，姑娘见了就欢笑。但是，古卡的百鸟衣，只能骗骗土司那样的呆鸟。现代的古卡的效颦者们，想用它来骗过广大读者的眼睛，终于是不成的。
