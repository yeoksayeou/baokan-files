Comrades,
Respected Comrade Mao Zedong, long-tested leaders of our brother party—the Communist Party of China, brother delegates attending the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, we extend to you the warm congratulations of the Indian people and the Indian Communist Party.

    Our two countries are among the oldest in the world. The connection between our two countries began in ancient times and has never been damaged by any hostility. Historical records prove that our past connections have contributed to the development of the ancient cultures of both countries.

    The imperialists who enslaved the people attempted to isolate the people of our two countries. The emergence and development of the national movements in our two countries still connect us. From the time of Dr. Sun Yat-sen to the time of Chairman Mao Zedong, the Indian national movement has been supported by Chinese patriots. The Chinese national movement has also been supported by the broadest sections of Indian patriots. Today, we recall with deep emotion our dear Comrade Dwarkanath Kotnis, who sacrificed himself while serving in the glorious Eighth Route Army.

    India achieved national independence, the Chinese revolution achieved victory, and the People's Republic of China was proclaimed—thus, the two largest countries in the world stood up—which heralded the demise of the imperialist colonial system.

    The Indian people's heroic tradition of opposing imperialism, their strong demand for Asian solidarity, their long-standing desire for international peace, and their deep brotherly friendship for their close neighbor—the great Chinese people—have all been expressed in the declaration on the Five Principles, in the joint effort to strive for peace in Korea and Vietnam, and in the effort to strive for the success of the Bandung Conference. Our cooperative relationship in the struggle against colonialism and for world peace is continuing to develop.

    The victory of the Chinese revolution also forever buried the fallacy that Marxism-Leninism is a product of the material West and is incompatible with the spiritual East.

    Progressives in India are increasingly aware that the Chinese people have been able to achieve great victories because the Communist Party of China has successfully applied the scientific principles of Marxism-Leninism to China's reality. It is precisely because of this that the Chinese people have been able to defeat the most powerful imperialist country of our time and win a nationwide victory, establish a great people's democratic country in Asia, and complete the socialist transformation in less than ten years.

    In India, our party's policy is to defend and consolidate our country's national independence, enable our country to make a greater contribution to the cause of peace, complete the tasks of the democratic revolution, and open up the road to socialism in our country.

    We know that our problems are difficult and our struggles are arduous. However, we draw new strength and confidence from the growing strength and unity of the people around the world who are fighting for peace and progress, from the great achievements of People's China and the Soviet Union, and from the ever-strengthening cooperation between the people of our two countries and the people of the Soviet Union.

    The great Lenin once predicted that the unity between the Soviet Union, China, and India would be a decisive blow to world imperialism and would be beneficial to world socialism.

    On this solemn platform, in front of the representatives of brother parties from fifty-six countries, we Indian Communists pledge to make our greatest efforts to realize Lenin's legacy.

    Long live the Communist Party of China!
    Chinese and Indians are brothers!
    Long live the fraternal friendship of communism throughout the world!

### 印度共产党代表团团长南布迪里巴德同志致词

    印度共产党代表团团长南布迪里巴德同志致词同志们：
    尊敬的毛泽东同志，我们的兄弟党——中国共产党的久经锻炼的领导人们，参加中国共产党第八次代表大会的兄弟代表们，我们向你们转达印度人民和印度共产党的热烈的祝贺。
    我们两个国家都是世界上最古老的国家。我们两国间的联系开始于久远的古代，并且从来没有因为任何敌意而有所损害。历史的记载证明，我们过去的联系有助于两国古老的文化的发展。
    奴役人民的帝国主义者企图把我们两国人民隔离开来。我们两国民族运动的产生和发展还是把我们联系在一起。从孙逸仙博士的时代到毛泽东主席的时代，印度的民族运动一直受到中国爱国者的支持。中国的民族运动也曾受到最广泛阶层的印度爱国者的支持。今天我们怀着深切的感情来追忆我们亲爱的同志柯棣华大夫，他是在光荣的八路军中服务的时候牺牲的。
    印度取得了民族独立，中国革命取得了胜利，中华人民共和国宣告成立——这样，世界上两个最大的国家站起来了——这预告了帝国主义殖民制度的灭亡。
    印度人民的英勇的反对帝国主义斗争的传统，他们对亚洲团结的强烈要求，他们对国际和平的长期愿望，以及他们对他们的近邻——伟大的中国人民的深厚的兄弟情谊，都已经表现在关于五项原则的声明中，表现在共同争取朝鲜与越南的和平，以及争取万隆会议成功的努力中。我们在反对殖民主义、争取世界和平的斗争中的合作关系正在继续发展。
    中国革命的胜利又永远埋葬了一种谬论，说什么马克思列宁主义是物质的西方的产物，同精神的东方不相容。
    印度国内进步人士越来越深刻地认识到，中国人民之所以能够获得伟大的胜利，是因为中国共产党成功地将马克思列宁主义的科学原理运用于中国的实际。正是由于这一点，中国人民能够打败当代最强大的帝国主义国家而赢得全国性的胜利，建立了亚洲的一个伟大的人民民主国家，并且在不到十年的时光中完成社会主义的改造。
    在印度，我们党的政策是保卫和巩固我国的民族独立，使我国对和平事业作出更大的贡献，完成民主革命的任务，在我国开辟走向社会主义的道路。
    我们知道，我们的问题是困难的，我们的斗争是艰巨的。但是，我们从全世界为和平与进步而斗争的人民的不断增长的力量和团结中，从人民中国和苏联的伟大成就中，从我们两国人民同苏联人民之间的日益加强的合作中，获得了新的力量和信心。
    伟大的列宁曾经预言，苏联、中国和印度三国之间的团结对世界帝国主义将是决定性的打击，而有利于世界社会主义。
    在这个庄严的讲台上，在五十六个国家兄弟党的代表面前，我们印度共产党人保证为实现列宁的遗训而作最大的努力。
    中国共产党万岁！
    中国人和印度人是兄弟！
    全世界共产主义的兄弟友谊万岁！
