    Merchant Philosophy
    Linghu Xuan
    The philosophy of merchants is a "utilitarian" philosophy, advocating profit first and everything subordinate to profit. This idea was popular everywhere in the old society, and it has not completely disappeared among some people in the new society. The only difference is that the current wording is more subtle: that is, in addition to profit, culture is sometimes inevitably involved. If you don't believe it, there is written evidence:
    "We acknowledge the dual role of handicraft exports in terms of economics and culture, but its economic role should be regarded as the primary aspect." Therefore, "the exported commodities should focus on 'selling them out'..." (Guan Junzhe, "Opinions on the Opinions of Artists," "New Observation," 1956, No. 16).
    Speaking of commodities alone, they should naturally be "sold out," whether "primarily" or not. In any case, it is excusable to increase foreign exchange for the country. But the "commodities" we are talking about here are not soap and matches, but handicrafts that are promoted as "having national characteristics." Therefore, we might as well take a look at what kind of goods are being "sold out."
    According to the reports in some newspapers and magazines some time ago, the "Lord Guan" in colored porcelain is a large item among these commodities, and the big-bellied "Maitreya Buddha" is also a large item. Moreover, the author of the text quoted above specifically pointed out that they "have a wide market in the international market." Therefore, the Beijing Special Arts and Crafts Company has simply allowed ivory carving artists to carve "Imperial Portraits" of "Empress Dowager Cixi" of the Qing Dynasty. I don't know whether this kind of "handicraft" will play a "dual role in economics and culture" in the international market, or promote our "national style" to foreign friends?
    In fact, after these commodities arrive abroad, whether it is Lord Guan and Bodhisattva, or Cixi and the like, they always look more "cultural" than the braids and bound feet of the past; but when our kind foreign customers buy these goods as a symbol of our national culture because they like our national culture and art, do our export agencies think that they have played their "dual role," or do they also feel a little "apprehensive" and have a guilty conscience?
    Some comrades in our export agencies have their own logic. The article quoted above is a representative statement of their "sell it out first" theory, meaning that since it is a commodity, it is good to be able to "sell it out." Isn't the business of Lord Guan very prosperous? Bodhisattvas are also becoming popular, and even Cixi is about to "restore," so why bother to criticize their shortcomings and talk about the empty words of "improvement and enhancement"? It's really too unconcerned with "reality." Therefore, the author frankly retorted to the artists: "...artists have not come up with new products that have sales!"
    It is a fact that artists have produced few new designs, but to be fair, even these few designs have been blocked by some comrades in our export agencies using the "merchant's philosophy" as a shield. What "we must first consider its sales problem," "not suitable for sale, only for exhibition," it is really difficult to improve and enhance, more difficult than ascending to heaven. What's more, some comrades in the export agencies have praised Lord Guan and Bodhisattva so highly, which just shows their attitude towards new products. It seems that in their view, the current international market for handicrafts is still a world of gods and Buddhas, and nothing else has a place to stand.
    We should ask ourselves, are we "selling out" genuine "handicrafts with national characteristics," or cheap imitations? As the saying goes, "It's not that you're afraid of not knowing the goods, but that you're afraid of comparing goods." If people buy them back and compare them with the ancient cultural relics with real artistic value printed on our pictures, they may feel a little regretful about the comrades in our export agencies.
    In name, it is called the "dual role" of economy and culture, but in reality, it is enough to be able to "sell it out." This approach is certainly more pleasant to hear than the purely profit-seeking business philosophy of the old society, but we should also pay attention: when our commodities are "selling well" in the international market, don't "sell out" our thousands of years of cultural influence and today's international reputation along with them!

    商人哲学
    令狐弦
    商人的哲学是“唯利主义”的哲学，主张利润第一，一切服从利润。这种说法在旧社会到处风行，在新社会的某些人中也不见得完全消声匿迹，所不同的是现在的提法比较含蓄而已：即除了利润之外，有时还不免涉及到文化。不信，有文为证：
    “我们承认工艺品外销在经济上和文化上所起的双重作用，但是它在经济上所起的作用应被视为主要方面。”因而“其所出口的商品就应以‘销出去’为主……”（“新观察”1956年第十六期关俊哲“对美术家意见的意见”）
    单就商品而论，自然应该“销出去”，不管“为主”与否，反正能替国家增加外汇，是无可厚非的。但我们这里所说的“商品”，并不是指的肥皂和火柴，而是被宣传为“具有民族风格”的工艺品，因此我们就无妨看一看所“销出去”的究竟是一些怎样的货色。
    根据前些时候某些报纸杂志的反映，在这些商品里面，彩瓷的“关圣帝君”是大宗，大肚子“弥勒佛”也是大宗，而且上面所引文字的作者还特意指明“在国际市场上有广泛的销路”。所以最近北京市特种工艺公司就索性让象牙雕刻艺人雕刻起清朝“慈禧皇太后”的“御像”来了。不知道这种“工艺品”是将到国际市场上去起“经济上和文化上的双重作用”呢，还是去向外国朋友宣扬我们的“民族风格”？
    其实，这些商品到了国外之后，无论关公和菩萨，或是慈禧之类，看起来总比当年的辫子和小脚要“文化”得多；但是当我们那些好心的国外顾客为了喜欢我们民族的文化艺术而把这些货色当作我们民族文化的象征买去的时候，我们的出口机关是认为已经起到了它们的“双重作用”了呢，还是也感到有一点“惴惴乎”问心有愧呢？
    我们的出口机关的某些同志是有他们自己的逻辑的，上面所引的文章就是他们那种“销出去为主论”的代表言论，意思是说，既为商品，能“销出去”就好，关公的生意不是很兴隆吗？菩萨也在走红运，连慈禧也要“复辟”，何必还要再去挑剔它们的缺点，讲“改进与提高”的空话？真是太不讲究“实际”了。因此，作者就老实不客气地向着美术家回敬一句：“……美术家并没有拿出有销路的新产品来！”
    美术家拿出新的设计图样少是事实，但平心而论，仅就这些为数不多的图样，被我们的出口机关的某些同志用“商人的哲学”作挡箭牌挡掉的也不在少数。什么“要首先考虑其销路问题”啦，“并不适于销售，只能作展览品”啦，真是改进提高之难，难于上青天。何况出口机关的某些同志把关公和菩萨捧得那样高，这正说明他们对待新产品的态度。好像在他们看来，目前工艺品的国际市场还是神和佛的世界，别的东西是一概无立足之地的。
    我们应该自问，我们“销出去”的究竟是货真价实的“具有民族风格”的工艺美术品呢，还是廉价的冒牌货？俗话说，“不怕不识货，就怕货比货”。如果人家买回去和我们印在图片上的真正有艺术价值的古代文物比一比，说不定就会对我们出口机关的那些同志感到有点儿遗憾了。
    名义上号称经济与文化的“双重作用”，实际上只要能“销出去”就行，这种做法讲起来固然比旧社会的单纯唯利是图的生意经要好听得多，可是也应该注意：当我们的这些商品在国际市场上“畅销”的时候，不要连带把我们几千年来的文化影响和今天的国际声誉也一起“销出去”！
