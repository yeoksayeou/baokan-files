Xinhua News Agency, September 11th Dispatch from London: Following the failure of the "Five-Nation Committee's" mission, British and French government leaders held talks in London on September 10th to discuss what next steps the two countries should take. French Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Chauvel, who participated in the talks, said after the meeting that "no decisions were made." Further talks are to be held on the 11th.

The talks on the 10th lasted more than six hours. The British side was represented by Prime Minister Eden and Foreign Secretary Lloyd, while the French side was represented by Prime Minister Mollet and Foreign Minister Pineau. The chairman of the "Five-Nation Committee," Menzies, also joined the talks later.

Associated Press reported: "Importantly, no American participated in the meeting." The American representative on the "Five-Nation Committee," Henderson, arrived in London from Cairo on the 10th, but returned home without even leaving the airport.

According to Reuters reporter Marche, the following three issues were discussed during the talks: First, whether to submit the Suez Canal issue to the United Nations now; second, under what circumstances should the British and French troops currently assembled in the Mediterranean be used; and third, whether to advise British and French canal pilots to resign again.

Egypt's recently proposed suggestion of establishing a negotiating body representing all canal users to peacefully resolve the canal issue may offer a hope for resolution. However, a British Foreign Office spokesman immediately rejected the proposal, saying that Egypt's proposal "does not provide any basis for negotiation."

Unofficial comments from Whitehall stated that Egypt's new proposal was merely a reiteration of its willingness to negotiate on Nasser's own terms, and did not make the slightest concession to the Western view that Egypt must hand over the management of the canal to an international body.

The British and French military buildup has strengthened the view here that military force remains a factor in the West's consideration of how to determine the next steps in the current situation.

    “五国委员会”在埃及的使命失败后
    英法政府首脑在伦敦商量新计策
    英外交部发言人一口拒绝了埃及的新建议
    据新华社11日讯　伦敦消息：英法政府首脑9月10日在伦敦举行会谈，商量“五国委员会”使命失败后两国应该采取怎样的下一步骤。参加会谈的法国驻英国大使萧维尔在会谈结束后说，会谈“没有作出任何决定”。11日还要举行会谈。
    10日的会谈进行了六个多小时，英国方面参加会谈的有首相艾登和外交大臣劳埃德，法国方面有总理摩勒和外交部长比诺。“五国委员会”主席孟席斯后来也参加了会谈。
    美联社消息指出：“重要的是，这次会谈没有一个美国人参加。”“五国委员会”里的美国代表汉德逊10日从开罗到伦敦后，连飞机场都没有离开，就回国去了。
    据路透社记者马尔希报道，会谈中讨论了下面三个问题：一、现在是否要把苏彝士运河问题提交联合国；二、在什么情况下应该利用现在集结在地中海的英法军队；三、是否要再度劝告运河的英法籍领航员离职。
    埃及最近提出的建立一个代表所有运河使用者的谈判机构来和平解决运河问题的建议可能提供了解决的希望。但是英国外交部发言人立即拒绝了这个建议，他说埃及的建议“并没有提供任何谈判的基础”。
    白厅的非正式评论说，埃及的新建议只是重新表示愿意根据纳赛尔自己的条件进行谈判而已，而对于西方认为埃及必须把运河的管理权交给国际机构的态度没有作出丝毫让步。
    英法的军事行动加强了这里的这种看法：军事力量仍然是西方在目前局势中考虑如何确定下一步骤方面的一个因素。
