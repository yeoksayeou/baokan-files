    How can we improve the quality of light industrial products? According to inspections in fourteen provinces and cities, compared with the third quarter of last year, the quality of 141 major products in the textile, food, and light industries in the first quarter of this year is as follows: About 30% have significantly improved, about 50% are basically stable or slightly improved, and about 20% are still poor or even declining. Generally speaking, the quality of products from state-owned factories is higher, local state-owned and old joint state-private factories are okay, new joint state-private factories are generally worse, large factories are better, and small factories are worse. From a regional perspective, the quality of products from old industrial cities along the coast is better, while the quality in inland areas is worse.

    Why is the quality of some light industrial products still not good, and in some cases even declining? The serious problem is still the idea of neglecting quality at play. For example, when various localities proposed to complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule in 1956, many enterprises only focused on output value and quantity, and relaxed quality control. Some printing and dyeing factories cancelled the "mercerization" process; some silk reeling factories put forward the slogan of "chasing output first, then chasing quality"; some shoe factories had 35% of their workers exceeding the output quota, but the quality declined month by month; some products were in short supply, so product quality was neglected.

    How can we continuously improve the quality of light industrial products? This is a very complex economic and technical issue, involving a wide range of aspects. However, whether the majority of workers value product quality is the primary key to whether product quality can be improved. Facts have proven that the same production worker, under the same production conditions, will produce better product quality when operating carefully, and will produce poor quality when violating operating procedures. In the same factory, under roughly the same conditions, the results are different due to some enterprise leaders paying attention to product quality and others not paying attention to it. How can we enable every enterprise leader and every worker to pay sustained and greater attention to product quality? This requires constantly strengthening political and ideological education, carrying out inter-factory competitions in the same industry and for the same products, and conscientiously summarizing and promoting advanced experiences. At the same time, the interests of the state, the requirements of consumers, and the profits of each enterprise and the income of each employee must be closely integrated. This requires the relevant departments to make necessary improvements to the current management system, especially the wage and reward system, so that enterprises and producers with high product quality can receive due material rewards.

    If the raw materials for light industry are of the same quality, under the same other conditions, products of the same quality can generally be produced. If the quality of raw materials is different, under the same other conditions, good raw materials generally produce good products, and bad raw materials produce bad products. If the supply of raw materials changes frequently, it will cause frequent fluctuations in product quality. For example, the requirements for cotton yarn used in knitwear and yarn used in weaving are different, and failure to allocate according to needs will affect product quality. If the zinc used to manufacture batteries is not refined purely and is not well calendered, it will be difficult to make durable batteries. Other raw materials such as steel sheets for making clocks and watches, fragrances for cosmetics, iridium and plastics for gold pens, key springs for accordions, and black iron sheets for enamel, all have a greater impact on product quality. Therefore, improving the quality of raw materials for light industry, improving the work of processing and grading raw materials, and fixing the supply of raw materials as much as possible according to the needs of light industrial products are important factors in improving the quality of light industrial products.

    The quality of equipment also affects the quality of products. For example, the machine for pressing pencil leads in a pencil factory should ideally be over 100 tons, but we currently only have 20 tons, which makes the pencil lead not hard enough; some factories adopt the method of vitrification to strengthen the hardness of the lead core, which will tear the paper when used. Using iron barrels to transport or store white wine will increase the lead content in the wine. Some small cigarette factories use noodle-pressing machines to press cigarette stems, which will inevitably affect the quality of cigarettes. Some vegetable oil factories do not have refining equipment, so the content of phospholipids in the product is too high and cannot leave the factory. These important pieces of equipment should be gradually improved according to future investment conditions to ensure improved product quality.

    To improve the quality of light industrial products, it is also necessary to strengthen production management, technical management, and scientific research. At present, there are still many products that do not have quality standards and operating procedures, nor inspection systems, or although there are these standards, procedures, and systems, they are very incomplete, making it difficult to distinguish between good and bad products. These standards, procedures, and systems should be formulated or supplemented by factories or industrial management departments according to the situation, resolutely implemented, and continuously supplemented and revised in the process of implementation. In order to improve product quality and trial-produce new products, it is necessary to train technical cadres and strengthen research work; the results of new product trials should be gradually promoted after being reviewed and approved. Since many light industrial products are daily necessities, they must not only be durable but also beautiful, so the art design work of light industrial products is also very important.

    Improving the quality of light industrial products must adapt to the current living standards of the people. Higher requirements are set for export products and certain high-end consumer goods, and the selling price can also be higher, but for products needed by the vast urban and rural people, the method of excessively increasing costs and raising selling prices cannot be generally adopted, and the purchasing power and consumption level of the vast people must be taken into account. This should also be taken into account when comparing the quality of products.

### 怎样提高轻工业品质量

    怎样提高轻工业品质量
    轻工业产品的质量到底改进得怎么样了？根据十四个省市的检查，同去年第三季度比较，今年第一季度纺织工业、食品工业、轻工业的一百四十一种主要产品的质量情况是：有显著提高的约占30％，基本稳定或略有改进的约占50％，仍然不好甚至下降的约占20％。一般地说，国营厂的产品质量较高，地方国营、老公私合营厂还好，新公私合营厂一般较差，大厂较好，小厂较差。从地区来看，沿海老工业城市的产品质量较好，内地较差。
    为什么若干轻工业产品的质量仍然不好，有的甚至还在下降呢？严重的问题仍然是忽视质量的思想作怪。例如：1956年各地在提出要提前完成五年计划的时候，不少企业只注意了产值和产量，放松了质量。有的印染厂取消了“丝光”工序；有的缫丝厂提出“先撵产量，后撵质量”的口号；有的皮鞋厂有35％的工人突破产量定额，但质量却逐月下降；有些产品因为供不应求，就忽视了产品质量。
    怎样才能不断地提高轻工业产品的质量呢？这是一个十分复杂的经济问题和技术问题，牵涉的面很广。但是，广大职工对产品质量的重视与否，是产品质量能不能提高的首要关键。事实证明：同一个生产工人，在生产条件相同的情况下，当他细心操作的时候，产品质量就好；违反操作规程的时候，质量就不好。在同一个工厂中，在各种条件大体相同的情况下，由于企业领导者对产品质量有的重视也有的不重视，结果就不同。如何才能使每一个企业领导人、每一个工人能够持久地、更多地注意产品的质量呢？这就需要经常地加强政治思想教育工作，开展同行业、同产品的厂际竞赛，认真总结和推广先进经验。同时还要使国家的利益、消费者的要求和每一个企业的利润、每一个职工的收入密切地结合起来。这就需要主管部门对目前的若干经营管理制度特别是工资奖励制度作必要的改进，使产品质量高的企业和生产者，得到应有的物质奖励。
    轻工业的原料如果质量相同，在其他条件相同的情况下，一般可以出产相同质量的产品。如果原料的质量不同，在其他条件相同的情况下，大体上是好原料出产好的产品，不好的原料出产不好的产品。原料供应如果经常变化，就会引起产品质量的经常波动。例如针织品所用的棉纱和织布用纱的要求不同，不根据需要调配就会影响产品的质量。制造电池所需要的锌皮，如果锌的提炼不纯，压延不好，就很难做出经久耐用的电池。其他如制造钟表用的钢片、化妆品用的香料、金笔用的铱金和塑料、手风琴用的键簧、搪瓷用的黑铁皮等等，都是对产品质量影响较大的原料。因此，提高轻工业的原料品质，改善原料的加工分级工作，根据轻工业产品的需要，尽可能地固定原料供应，是提高轻工业产品质量的重要因素。
    设备的好坏也会影响到产品的质量。例如：铅笔厂压铅笔芯的机器，最好是用一百多吨的，但我们目前只有二十吨的，以致铅芯硬度不够；有的厂采取瓷化的办法来加强铅芯的硬度，在使用的时候就会划破纸张。白酒用铁桶运输或存储，就会增加酒内含铅量。有的小烟厂用压面条的机器压烟梗，必然要影响卷烟的质量。有的植物油厂没有精炼设备，以致产品内磷脂的含量过高，不能出厂。像这些重要的设备，应当根据今后的投资情况逐步加以改进，才能保证提高产品质量。
    要提高轻工业产品质量，还需要加强生产管理、技术管理和科学研究工作。目前还有不少产品没有质量标准和工艺规程，也没有检验制度，或者是虽然有这些标准、规程和制度，但很不完备，使这些产品好坏难分。应当根据情况，分别由工厂或工业管理部门制定或补充这些标准、规程和制度，坚决贯彻执行，在执行过程中，再不断地补充和修正。为了提高产品质量和试制新产品，必须培养技术干部，加强研究工作；新产品试验结果，应该经过审定合格之后，再逐步推广。由于轻工业产品，很多是日用产品，不仅要求经久耐用，而且还要美观，所以轻工业产品的美术设计工作也是很重要的。
    提高轻工业的产品质量必须适应当前的人民生活水平。对于出口产品和某些高级消费品，要求较高，售价也可以高一些，而对于广大城乡人民需要的产品，一般地不能采取过多地加大成本提高售价的办法，必须照顾到广大人民的购买力和消费水平。在进行产品好坏对比的时候，也应当考虑到这一点。
