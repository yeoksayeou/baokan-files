Xinhua News Agency, September 16th: TASS reports: The Soviet government issued a statement on September 15th regarding the need for a peaceful resolution of the Suez Canal issue.

The Soviet government believes it is necessary to reiterate that freedom of navigation on the Suez Canal should be guaranteed for all countries, and that this guarantee can and should only be achieved through peaceful means, taking into account Egypt's inalienable sovereignty and the interests of all countries using the Suez Canal. There is no other way.

The statement said that people of all circles in the world rightly regard the Western countries' plan to establish a "Suez Canal Users' Association" as a dangerous provocation, which will further exacerbate the situation in the Suez Canal and artificially create incidents as an excuse to take military action against Egypt.

This plan is thoroughly intended to seize the right to manage the canal from Egypt and transfer it to a foreign management organization. It cannot be ignored that to realize this plan, it would be necessary to use force against Egypt. If it were not intended to deliberately exacerbate the situation and create incidents, there would be no reason to establish a foreign association to manage the Egyptian canal owned by the Egyptian state and people.

The British government attempts to justify its war preparations with the reasoning that Egypt's nationalization of the Suez Canal Company seems to be an act of war. But this claim can obviously only fool those who are too naive. It is not Egypt who is sending troops against Britain and France, but on the contrary, the armies of these two countries are gathering near Egypt.

When taking military measures against Egypt, the French government declared that it was doing so to protect French citizens residing in Egypt. However, it is clear to everyone that no one has threatened French citizens residing in Egypt in the past or present.

In the United States, although some people have repeatedly talked about a peaceful resolution, in reality the United States does not object to the gathering of troops and the threat of the use of force, which cannot but embolden those in Britain and France who advocate the use of force against Egypt.

The military preparations taken by Britain and France against Egypt can only be regarded as Britain and France's intention to seize the Suez Canal, which flows through Egyptian territory and is under Egyptian sovereignty. No matter how they justify it, this move can only be regarded as an act of aggression against Egypt. However, they have forgotten that in today's vigorous development of the Eastern people who have embarked on the broad road of independent development and national rejuvenation, and in the current era of destructive weapons such as atomic and hydrogen weapons, threats and displays of force are not acceptable, and things cannot be done as they were during the heyday of colonialism.

The Soviet government believes that the military preparations taken by Britain and France with the support of the United States to exert pressure on Egypt on the Suez issue are a gross violation of the principles of the United Nations. The United Nations cannot but react to the current situation.

In the spirit of promoting a peaceful resolution of the Suez Canal issue, the Soviet government is satisfied to accept the Egyptian government's note of September 10th proposing the convening of a new international conference, and expresses its willingness to participate in the aforementioned conference. At the same time, the Soviet government agrees that the participants in the conference should include representatives of the contracting parties to the 1888 Convention (including the legal successors of the contracting parties to the aforementioned Convention), representatives of Arab countries whose territories are directly adjacent to the canal and who have a vital interest in a peaceful resolution of the issue, and representatives of other countries using the Suez Canal. The Soviet government expresses its willingness to participate in the negotiating body proposed by the Egyptian government, which should include representatives of countries with different views using the canal, and its purpose is to seek a basis for resolving the Suez Canal issue that is acceptable to everyone.

The Soviet government declares that as a major power, the Soviet Union cannot stand idly by on the Suez issue and cannot but be concerned about the situation now caused by the actions of Western countries. This is understandable, because any actions that undermine peace in the Middle East cannot but involve the security interests of the Soviet state.

The Soviet Union will continue to work to take measures to promote a fair resolution of the Suez issue through consultation.

The Soviet government hopes that all those who cherish the interests of peace, all those who are willing to establish relations with other countries in deed rather than in word based on the principles of equality and non-interference in other countries' internal affairs, can take measures to ensure that the Suez Canal issue can be peacefully resolved in accordance with the national interests and rights of Egypt, and in accordance with the interests of consolidating peace and international cooperation.

### 苏联政府发表声明  苏联不能对苏彝士问题袖手旁观将继续努力促进和平解决运河问题

    苏联政府发表声明
    苏联不能对苏彝士问题袖手旁观将继续努力促进和平解决运河问题
    据新华社16日讯　据塔斯社报道：苏联政府9月15日发表了关于必须和平解决苏彝士运河问题的声明。
    苏联政府认为有必要再次声明，苏彝士运河的航行自由对各国都应当有保证，这种情况的保证可以而且只应当通过和平的办法来实现，并且应当考虑到埃及的不可剥夺的主权和使用苏彝士运河的各国的利益。其他的道路是没有的。
    声明说，世界各界人士公正地把西方国家策划建立“苏彝士运河使用国协会”的计划看成是一个危险的挑衅，它会进一步加剧苏彝士运河的局势，人为地制造事件以作为采取武力反对埃及的借口。
    这个计划彻头彻尾是想把运河的管理权从埃及手里夺走，转给外国的管理机构。不能不看到，要实现这一计划，就得采用武力反对埃及。如果不是想故意加剧局势和制造事件，便没有理由需要建立一个外国的协会来管理属于埃及国家和人民所有的埃及的运河。
    英国政府想用这样一个理由来解释自己的备战活动：埃及把苏彝士运河公司收归国有，似乎就是动了武。但是这种说法显然只能哄那些过于天真的人。不是埃及派兵反对英、法，而相反，是这两个国家的军队在向埃及附近集结。
    法国政府采取对付埃及的军事措施的时候声明说，法国政府这样做是为了保护旅居埃及的法国公民。但是，大家清楚地知道过去和现在没有一个人威胁旅居埃及的法国公民。
    在美国，虽然也有人一再高谈和平解决问题，但是实际上美国并不反对集结军队和使用武力的威胁，这不能不助长英法两国主张对埃及使用武力的人的气焰。
    英法两国对埃及所采取的军事准备工作，只能被认为是英法两国打算霸占流过埃及国土并且处在埃及主权之下的苏彝士运河。这种举动，不论他们怎样辩解，只能被认作是对埃及的侵略行为。但是，他们忘记了，在走上了独立发展和民族复兴的康庄大道的东方人民蓬勃发展的今天，在有了像原子武器、氢武器这类破坏性武器的现时代，威胁和炫耀武力是不行的，不能再像殖民主义得势时期那样干了。
    苏联政府认为，英国和法国为了在苏彝士问题上对埃及施加压力而在美国的支持下采取的军事准备，粗暴地违反了联合国的原则。联合国对当前的局势不能不有所反应。
    苏联政府本着促进苏彝士运河问题和平解决的愿望，满意地接受了埃及政府9月10日发出的建议召开一次新的国际会议的照会，并且表示愿意参加上述会议。同时，苏联政府赞成参加会议的应有1888年公约各缔约国的代表（包括上述公约缔约国的法律继承者）、领土直接靠近运河的、对和平解决这个问题有切身利害关系的阿拉伯国家代表、和使用苏彝士运河的其他国家代表。苏联政府表示愿意参加埃及政府提出的主持谈判的机构，这个机构应有使用运河的、观点不同的各国代表参加，它的目的是寻求大家都可以接受的、解决苏彝士运河问题的基础。
    苏联政府宣布，作为一个大国，苏联不能对苏彝士问题袖手旁观，不能不关心现在由于西方国家的行动而造成的局势。这是可以理解的，因为任何破坏中近东地区和平的行动都不能不涉及到苏维埃国家安全的利益。
    苏联将继续努力采取措施，来促进通过协商公正地解决苏彝士问题。
    苏联政府希望，一切珍视和平利益的人，一切不是在口头上而是在行动上愿意根据平等和不干涉他国内政的原则同别国建立关系的人，都能采取措施来使苏彝士运河问题得以按照埃及的民族利益和权利、按照巩固和平和国际合作的利益和平解决。
