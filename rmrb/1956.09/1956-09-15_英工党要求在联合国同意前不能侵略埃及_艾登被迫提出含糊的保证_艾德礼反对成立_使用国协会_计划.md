Xinhua News Agency, London, September 14th. During last night's House of Commons debate, British Prime Minister Eden was pressed hard by opposition members who strongly demanded he guarantee the government would not use force on the Suez issue without UN agreement. Eden was ultimately forced to offer some vague assurances.

    Labour leader Gaitskell asked if the Prime Minister was prepared, like Dulles, to announce on behalf of the government that they would not force their way through the canal. Eden replied: "Regarding what action to take, we are in complete agreement with the US government. The first action is to ask the Egyptian government to cooperate. If they do not cooperate...we should submit the issue to the Security Council."

    Later he said that the opposition party demanded a guarantee that force would never be used unless it was submitted to the Security Council. He said, "If such a guarantee is to be given absolutely, then neither I nor any minister here can provide it." He said, "No one can say what action Colonel Nasser will take in the canal zone or in Egypt."

    But he then said: "Nevertheless, I am willing to give such an answer, and I think such an answer is the maximum that any government can do. If circumstances permit, that is, barring emergency events, we do intend to submit such a matter to the Security Council." Eden indicated that the Menzies delegation's proposal was still valid. He said: the proposal has not been withdrawn, and Egypt can still accept it. In this sense, the plan to establish a Canal Users' Association is not an alternative proposal. It is a temporary plan to cope with the current situation. He said that a meeting will be held in the next few days to decide how to implement the plan.

    Before Eden spoke, Foreign Secretary Lloyd defended the government's policy and countered Gaitskell's speech on September 12. Subsequently, Robens spoke on behalf of the Labour Party, offering a rebuttal.

    Lloyd moved a motion requesting support for the government's policy. When talking about the opposition party's proposed motion to impeach the government, he denied the government refused to submit the dispute to the United Nations. He stated that the government did not intend to immediately submit the issue to the United Nations because the government did not agree that there was no solution to the problem outside the United Nations. When talking about the government's unwillingness to submit the issue to the United Nations, he pointed out: in the Security Council, there is Russia's veto power, and if it is brought to the United Nations General Assembly, the plan to establish an international organization may not be produced. Even if such a plan is indeed produced, it would be produced after weeks of debate and countless amendments that would be enough to make it lose its effect. Lloyd attacked Gaitskell, saying that he was trying to take the opportunity to use the serious international situation, and if the British government's position has been weakened, then this is what weakened it.

    When Alfred Robens began to present the opposition party's arguments, a burst of cheers came from the opposition party. Robens said: "It is the task of the opposition party to try to stop a stupid and stubborn government from dragging our country into war."
    Robens said: If the Foreign Secretary reads the newspaper, he should know that more than half of the country opposes the use of force. He pointed out that the statement of the British Trades Union Congress cannot be ignored. It represents millions of organized workers in our country. He said that the Prime Minister's speech yesterday was equivalent to a threat of force. Talking about the world's reaction to Eden's speech, Robens said: not only India and Ceylon, but also Australia are not only very skeptical about the Canal Users' Association plan, but also very unhappy that they knew nothing about the plan before the Prime Minister announced it. Robens asked: "Is the establishment of this new user organization to promote negotiations, or will its result be a huge act of provocation? If it is said that it is to force negotiations, I cannot understand why such an organization should be organized, because negotiations can be carried out by submitting the issue to the United Nations." He said: None of the things mentioned by the Prime Minister that the User Organization can do can be done unless Egypt agrees. Robens said: "You cannot solve the Suez Canal problem with war. The final lasting solution can only be achieved through agreements reached through free negotiations." "This is not just a dispute about the Suez Canal. It will also determine what kind of world we want to live in - a world of the rule of law or a world of the survival of the fittest." Robens asked the House of Commons to vote in favor of the opposition party's amendment motion, he said: "Voting in favor of the amendment is to support acting soberly in world affairs, and the government's policy will only cause conflict." Former Labour government Defense Minister Shinwell also spoke in the debate on the 13th. He said that the Canal Users' plan contains an American conspiracy. "I am very skeptical of the United States, as far as the Middle East is concerned, and I don't want to see this great country (Britain) become a pawn in American diplomatic strategy." Shinwell said he believed there were elements in the United States who wanted to kick Britain out of the Middle East - in terms of oil. "Perhaps sometimes, they are not opposed to getting us into some trouble, because this is suitable for their plans. I hope my idea is wrong, but I think it is related to the decision to establish the User Association."

    After the debate, the opposition party was dissatisfied with Eden's reply, so they put their impeachment motion to a vote. As a result, the motion was defeated by 321 votes to 271. Then, the House of Commons voted on a vote of confidence in the government's policy by 319 votes to 248.

    Another motion proposed by the opposition party requiring the House of Commons to continue to hold meetings was also rejected.
    Xinhua News Agency, London, September 14th. The British House of Lords continued to debate the Suez Canal issue on September 13, and the opposition party put forward a motion to impeach the government's policy.

    Former Prime Minister Attlee spoke on behalf of the Labour Party, criticizing the plan to establish a "Suez Canal Users' Association." He said that the route taken by the government "is fraught with the most serious dangers to peace, it threatens Britain's position in the world and threatens the position of the entire Commonwealth."

    Attlee said he did not approve of French troops being stationed in Cyprus. He also said that the British government "seems to have inappropriately turned the entire Middle East against us (Britain). We have no friends in the Middle East."

    Attlee said he did not want to say "a word against the United States." At the same time, he believed that the United States' attitude towards the plan to establish a "Suez Canal Users' Association" and Eisenhower's remarks on September 12 about not using force were "somewhat contradictory."

    Attlee called for the Suez Canal issue to be submitted to the United Nations. So as not to "return to the chaos of anarchy and war."

    The House of Lords rejected the impeachment motion by 145 votes to 18. The vote of confidence in the government was not put to a vote, and it was considered passed.

### 英工党要求在联合国同意前不能侵略埃及  艾登被迫提出含糊的保证  艾德礼反对成立“使用国协会”计划

    英工党要求在联合国同意前不能侵略埃及
    艾登被迫提出含糊的保证
    艾德礼反对成立“使用国协会”计划
    新华社伦敦14日讯　在昨天晚上的下院辩论中，英国首相艾登被反对派议员逼得很紧，他们竭力要求他保证政府不经联合国同意不在苏彝士问题上使用武力。艾登最后被迫提出了一些含糊的保证。
    工党领袖盖次克尔问，首相是否准备像杜勒斯一样代表政府宣布他们将不强行通过运河。艾登回答说：“关于采取什么行动，我们同美国政府的意见完全一致。首先采取的行动是要求埃及政府合作。如果他们不合作，……我们就应该把这个问题提交安全理事会。”
    后来他又说，反对党要求保证除非在提交安全理事会以后，绝不使用武力。他说，“如果要绝对地来提出这种保证的话，那么，不论是我还是在这里的任何大臣都不能提供这种东西。”他说，“没有人能说纳赛尔中校在运河区或者在埃及会采取什么行动。”
    但是他接着说：“尽管如此，我还是愿意给予这样一个答复，我想这样一个答复是任何政府所能做到的最大限度。如果情况许可，那就是说除了发生紧急事变以外，我们的确打算把这样一种问题提交安全理事会。”艾登表明孟席斯代表团的建议仍旧有效。他说：这个建议并没有收回，埃及仍旧可以接受。从这种意义上说，成立运河使用国协会的计划并不是一种替代建议。这是为了应付当前的局势而提出的临时计划。他说在今后几天内将举行会议决定如何实行这个计划。
    在艾登发言之前，外交大臣劳埃德为政府政策进行辩解，并且反击了盖次克尔9月12日的发言。随后罗本斯代表工党发言，进行反驳。
    劳埃德提出动议，要求支持政府的政策。他在谈到反对党所提出的弹劾政府的修正动议的时候，否认政府拒绝把这个争端提交联合国处理。他表示了政府不打算立即把这个问题提交联合国，因为政府并不同意在联合国之外已经再没有解决问题的办法。他在谈到政府不愿意向联合国提出这个问题的时候指出：在安全理事会上，有俄国的否决权，而如果提到联合国大会上，成立国际机构的计划也许产生不出来。即使的确产生了这种计划，那它也是经过若干星期的辩论，遭受了足以使它丧失作用的无数的修正以后才产生出来的。劳埃德抨击盖次克尔说，他希图趁机利用严重的国际局势，如果英国政府的地位已经削弱，那末这就是使它削弱的东西。
    当艾尔弗雷德·罗本斯开始提出反对党的论点的时候，反对党方
  面发出了一阵喝采声。罗本斯说：“尽力制止愚蠢而又顽固的政府把我国拖入战争正是反对党的任务。”
  罗本斯说：如果外交大臣看报的话，他应该知道全国有一半以上的人都反对使用武力。他指出英国职工大会的声明是不能忽视的。它代表着我们国家好几百万有组织的工人。他说，首相昨天的讲话等于是武力威胁。谈到全世界对艾登的发言的反应，罗本斯说：不仅是印度和锡兰，而且还有澳大利亚也都不仅对运河使用国协会的计划感到非常怀疑，而且还都因为在首相宣布以前它们一点也不知道这种计划而感到非常不快。罗本斯问道：“设立这个新的使用国组织是为了促进谈判呢，还是说它的结果将是一种巨大的挑衅行为呢？如果说它是为了强迫进行谈判的话，我就不能理解为什么要组织这样一个组织，因为谈判可以通过把问题提交联合国的办法来进行。”他说：首相所提到的使用国组织所做的那些事情中，是一件也做不成的，除非埃及表示同意。罗本斯说：“你不能用战争来解决苏彝士运河问题。最后的持久的解决只有通过经过自由谈判达成的协议才能实现。”“这不仅是关于苏彝士运河的纠纷。这也将决定我们希望生活在哪一种世界里——法治的世界还是弱肉强食的世界。”罗本斯要求下院投票通过反对党的修正动议，他说：“投票赞成修正案就是支持在世界事务中清醒地行事，政府的政策只会引起冲突。”前工党政府国防大臣辛威尔也在13
  日的辩论中发了言。他说，运河使用国计划含有美国的阴谋。“我对美国是非常怀疑的，就中东方面说来是这样的，我并不希望看到这个伟大的国家（英国）成为美国的外交策略中的走卒。”辛威尔说，他相信在美国有一些分子想把英国踢出中东——就石油而言是这样。“也许有时候，他们并不反对使我们卷进一些麻烦中去，因为这是适合他们的计划的。我希望我这种想法是错误的，但是我认为这是同建立使用国协会的这个决定有联系的”。
    辩论结束之后，反对党对艾登的答复感到不满意，于是就把他们的弹劾动议交付表决。表决结果，动议以三百二十一票对二百七十一票被击败。接着，下院又以三百十九票对二百四十八票对政府的政策投了信任票。
    反对党提出的要求下院继续举行会议的另一项动议也被否决了。
    新华社伦敦14日电　英国上院9月13日继续就苏彝士运河问题进行辩论，反对党对政府的政策提出了弹劾案。
    前首相艾德礼代表工党发言，抨击成立“苏彝士运河使用国协会”的计划。他说，政府所采取的路线“充满着对和平的最严重的危险，它威胁到英国在世界上的地位，并且威胁到整个英联邦的地位。”
    艾德礼表示，他不赞成让法国军队进驻塞浦路斯。他还说，英国政府“似乎已经很不恰当地使整个中东起来反对我们（英国）。我们在中东已经没有什么朋友了。”
    艾德礼说，他不想说“一句反对美国的话”。同时，他认为，美国对于设立“苏彝士运河使用国协会”计划的态度和艾森豪威尔9月12日关于不应该使用武力的那番话“有些矛盾”。
    艾德礼要求把苏彝士运河问题提交联合国。以免“回到无政府状态和战争的混乱中去”。
    上院以一百四十五票对十八票否决了这个弹劾案。对政府的信任案没有提付表决，就算通过。
