Xinhua News Agency News: Xinhua News Agency reporters Li Feng and Lin Yin analyzed the reasons for the current tense transportation situation in some areas, saying: The fundamental reason for the tension in railway, highway, and inland river transportation in some areas is the overall upsurge in the national economy. This year, the materials that need to be transferred for national economic construction and market supply have greatly increased compared to last year, and the freight volume has risen sharply. However, China's original transportation equipment is relatively backward, and there are some problems in the business management of enterprises, so the increase in transportation capacity cannot keep up with the increase in freight volume. In addition, some areas suffered from natural disasters such as typhoons and rainstorms this year. Since June, many roads and bridges have been washed away by floods, or the roadbeds have been damaged or paralyzed. After the floods receded, traffic could not be quickly restored for a while. This has made the contradiction between transportation capacity and freight volume more obvious and acute since July and August.

As for the sudden increase in the number of passengers on some railway trunk lines and the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, it is mainly due to the summer vacation, with a large number of students, demobilized military officers returning home for vacation, cadres going for recuperation, senior intellectuals, and workers traveling back and forth. In particular, a large number of workers and their families are going to support the construction of the Northwest and Southwest, and tens of thousands of immigrants have to rush to Gansu before the autumn planting.

Of course, each region and each transportation department has its own different and very complicated reasons.

From the perspective of the railway department, because a large number of materials supporting the construction of various new industrial bases in the Northwest need to pass through North China and be transported to the Northwest, and currently there is only one railway leading to the Northwest, this has formed the situation of extremely tense transportation on the western section of the Longhai Railway, the Zhengtai Railway, and the northern section of the Jinghan Railway; coupled with the poor quality of the Baoji-Lanzhou line on the western section of the Longhai Railway, the transportation capacity is very small, and initial technical transformation is currently underway. For seven or eight hours every day, trains are not running at all, allowing workers to carry out line equipment improvement projects or build double tracks. In this way, a large number of materials are backlogged along the Zhengzhou-Baoji railway line, and many passengers cannot buy tickets. However, if initial technical transformation is not carried out now, this tight transportation situation will become even more serious in the future. Because with the development of the national economy, passenger and freight transport will inevitably increase significantly. If the western section of the Longhai Railway, the Zhengtai Railway, and the northern section of the Jinghan Railway had started initial technical transformation last year or the year before, the current tense transportation situation might have been avoided. Facing the current situation, the Ministry of Railways has put forward a relatively ideal requirement this year: "Transportation and engineering should not be delayed." Now, judging from the actual situation of the Baoji-Lanzhou section of the railway, the result is "transformation has not been completed, and transportation is tight first." Although the Baoji-Chengdu Railway was connected and opened to traffic in early July, it has not yet officially opened for business and cannot transport passengers and goods. However, some people mistakenly believe that direct rail connection means the start of business, and a large number of passengers and goods are attracted to Baoji, Chengdu, Guangyuan, and other places to wait for transportation. According to reporters, the Baoji-Chengdu Railway is still carrying out disease control projects, and it is difficult to predict whether it can officially open for business this year. This is also one of the important reasons for the extreme tension on the Shaanxi-Sichuan highway.

Objectively speaking, the reason for the tension in highway transportation is that the number of cars dedicated to transportation in China is not large, and the transportation capacity in some areas is indeed insufficient. And the Changchun Automobile Manufacturing Plant, which is the only one in China that can manufacture automobiles, has not been mass-produced since it was put into production, and this objective situation is difficult to change for a while. This year, the materials consigned to highway departments by various units increased by 30% compared to last year, while the number of cars only increased by 9%. The situation of insufficient transportation capacity is more serious than in previous years. In particular, the existing cars and the required amount in provinces (regions) such as Xinjiang, Qinghai, Gansu, Sichuan, and Tibet are very different. However, as far as the highway transportation department itself is concerned, the original and recently allocated cars in various parts of the country have not been fully utilized, and there is still great transportation potential that has not been tapped. The average utilization rate of cars in the national highway transportation department is only 69%, which means that more than 30% of the cars are either parked in car repair shops for repair, or are not participating in transportation at all due to a lack of drivers. The transportation efficiency of cars that have participated in transportation is also not high. Until now, the vast majority of car drivers have not implemented a two-shift system. Cars work during the day and rest at night. This is a great waste of national transportation capacity. There are also many problems in the maintenance and use of cars. At present, an average of 25% of highway transportation cars across the country are always parked in repair shops for repair, and some cars have been in the factory for repairs for as long as one or two months.

At the same time, a large number of trucks owned by various agencies and enterprises, although of good quality, mostly only reach a utilization rate of about 30%. In addition to transporting the goods of their own departments, this batch of transportation capacity has not been well organized and utilized to bear a part of the social freight volume. On the other hand, since the upsurge of agricultural cooperation, a large number of horse-drawn carts that originally participated in highway transportation have returned to the countryside to participate in agricultural cooperatives, thus reducing a part of the transportation force. Also, in the upsurge of cooperation, most of the automobile repair shops in many provinces and cities were converted into factories for repairing double-wheeled double-shared plows, which made many automobiles lose their "clinics," which also has a certain impact on the necessary maintenance work in the case of a large number of old cars in our country.

The most busiest inland river transportation, the Sichuan River, is also very tight, mainly because there are few high-horsepower ships that can navigate the Sichuan River, and even if there are ships in other regions, it is difficult to support the Sichuan River transportation. At the same time, the loading and unloading capacity of the port is insufficient, and the throughput capacity of the port is also very limited. On a national scale, railway, highway, and inland river transportation have not yet generally handled intermodal transportation, which has also caused railway and highway, water and land transportation to be unconnected, and the collection and distribution of goods is not timely, which not only affects transportation efficiency but also wastes national transportation power. It is of course an extremely complex and meticulous organizational work to universally implement railway, highway, and inland river intermodal transportation on a national scale, but it is also one of the important ways to unleash the national transportation potential.

    目前某些地区交通运输为什么紧张
    新华社讯　新华社记者李峰、林印分析目前某些地区交通运输紧张的原因说：有些地区铁路、公路、内河运输紧张的根本原因，是由于国民经济的全面高涨。今年国家经济建设和供应市场需要调运的物资比去年大大增多，货运量急骤上涨。而我国原有的各种运输设备相当落后，企业的经营管理上也存在一些问题，所以运输力的增长跟不上运量上涨的速度。另外，今年有些地区遭受了台风暴雨等自然灾害。6月以来，不少公路和桥梁被洪水冲断，或者路基被冲坏或瘫软。洪水退落后，一时尚不能迅速恢复通车。这就使运输能力和运量之间的矛盾，从7、8月以来更明显而尖锐地暴露出来。
    至于有些铁路干线上和长江上游旅客突然大量增加，主要是正逢暑假，有大批学生、休假回家的解放军军官、前往疗养的干部、高级知识分子和职工等旅行往返。特别是有大批职工和工人家属，要前往支援西北和西南的建设，几万移民要在秋种以前赶到甘肃。
    当然，各个地区和各个运输部门，都还有它不同的非常复杂的原因。
    就铁路部门来说，由于全国支援西北各个新工业基地建设的大批物资，要经过华北运向西北，而目前通向西北的又只有一条铁路，就形成了陇海路西段、正太路及京汉路北段这几条干线，运输异常紧张的情况；加上陇海路西段宝鸡到兰州的线路质量不好，运输能力很小，现在正在进行初期的技术改造，每天都有七、八个小时根本不开列车，让工人进行线路设备的改善工程或修建复线。这样，就有大批物资积压在郑州到宝鸡铁路沿线，许多旅客也买不上车票。可是如果现在不进行初期的技术改造，这种运输吃紧的情况今后将会更加严重。因为随着国民经济的发展，客运和货运必然还会大量增加。如果陇海路西段、正太铁路及京汉路北段，在去年或前年动手进行初期的技术改造，目前这种运输紧张的情况，也许可以避免。面对当前的事实，铁道部今年提出了一个比较理想的要求：“运输、工程两不误”。现在从宝鸡、兰州段铁路的实际情况来看，结果却是“改造未成，运输先吃紧”。宝成铁路虽然已在7月初接轨通车，至今并没有正式营业，不能运输旅客和货物。但是有些人却误认为直轨通车就是开始营业，大批旅客和货物被吸引到宝鸡、成都、广元等地待运。据记者了解，宝成铁路由于还在进行解决病害工程，今年内是否能正式营业，尚难预定。这也是造成陕川公路极度紧张的重要原因之一。
    公路运输紧张的原因，从客观上说，我国现有的运输专业用的汽车数量不多，某些地区运输力量的确不足。而我国唯一能制造汽车的长春汽车制造厂，投入生产不久，还没有大批生产，这种客观情况一时还难改变。今年各单位向公路部门托运的物资比去年增长30％，汽车只增加了9％。运输力不足的情况比往年更加严重。特别是新疆、青海、甘肃、四川、西藏等省（区），现有汽车和需要量相差十分悬殊。然而就公路运输部门本身来说，全国各地原有及最近增拨的汽车也还没有充分利用，还有很大运输潜力没有发挥。全国公路运输部门的汽车利用率平均只有69％，就是说还有30％以上的汽车，或是因为停在汽车修理厂里修理，或是因为缺乏司机，根本没有参加运输。已经参加运输的汽车，运输效率也不高。直到现在，绝大部分汽车司机还没有实行两班制。汽车白天工作，晚上休息。这是国家运输力的极大浪费。汽车的保养和使用上也存在很多问题。现在全国公路运输汽车平均经常有25％的汽车都停在修理厂里修理，有的汽车在厂修理的时间竟拖到一两个月之久。
    同时，各机关、企业自有的大量卡车，虽然质量好，但大多数利用率只达30％左右。这批运力除运输本部门的货物以外，未能很好地组织利用起来负担一部分社会运量。另一方面，自从农业合作化高潮到来之后，很大一批原来参加公路运输的马车，回到农村参加了农业社，因此减少了一部分运输力量。还有许多省市的汽车修理厂，在合作化高潮中，大部分改为修理双轮双铧犁的工厂，使许多汽车失去了“诊疗所”，这在我国旧汽车较多的情况下，对经常必要的维修保养工作也有一定的影响。
    内河运输最繁忙的川江，运输情况也很紧张，主要是因为能航行川江的大马力船舶少，其它地区即使有船也难以支援川江运输。同时港口的装卸力量不足，港口的吞吐能力也很有限。就全国范围说，铁路、公路和内河航运还没有普遍办理联运，也造成了铁路与公路、水运与陆运不相衔接，货物集散不及时，既影响运输效率，又浪费国家运输力量。在全国范围内普遍实行铁路、公路和内河联运，当然是件极其复杂而细致的组织工作，但是这也是发挥国家运输潜力的重要办法之一。
