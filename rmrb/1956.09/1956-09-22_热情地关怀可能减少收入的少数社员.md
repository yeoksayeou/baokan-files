    Enthusiastically Caring for the Minority of Cooperative Members Who May Have Reduced Income
    *People's Daily* Commentator
    Agricultural production cooperatives in various regions have made trial calculations of their annual income distribution. Judging from the results of these trials, with the exception of a few areas severely affected by disasters, the vast majority of agricultural cooperatives can increase production compared to the past, and the vast majority of cooperative members are likely to increase their income compared to last year. However, generally, several percent of the cooperatives, and in some cases even more than ten percent, may have members whose income is lower than last year. What measures should be considered for these few cooperative members who may have reduced income?

    Some say: There is no solution; agricultural cooperatives have only recently been established, the foundation is weak, there are many difficulties, and it is good enough to guarantee increased income for 90% of the cooperative members, it is inevitable that a few cooperative members cannot increase their income.

    Others say: Agricultural production cooperatives implement remuneration according to labor, and households with reduced income are due to weak labor or no labor. No matter how much production increases, they will not get much, what solutions can be considered?

    Indeed, the minority of cooperative members who may have reduced income all have special reasons. Some have weak labor or no labor; some families have many people but insufficient labor; some suddenly lost their labor force due to natural disasters or personal misfortunes; some, although they have labor, have difficult family lives and participate less in the cooperative's production; some have more land and more means of production, and after joining the advanced cooperative, land remuneration has been canceled, but the labor force is not large or strong; there are also a few people who are not active in labor and do not participate much in the cooperative's production labor, and so on. It is difficult to avoid the possibility of reduced income for a few cooperative members in the first year of running the cooperative due to the above reasons. Striving to prevent them from reducing their income does indeed have many difficulties. However, if we think there is no solution because it is difficult to avoid and there are difficulties, and adopt an indifferent attitude towards them, that is not right.

    Although some cooperative members may have reduced income for their own special reasons, this is also more or less related to the lack of experience and poor management on the part of the leadership of the agricultural cooperative. For example, many agricultural cooperatives neglect sideline production, especially neglecting to help cooperative members carry out household sideline production, and even restrict cooperative members from running household sideline businesses, which reduces the source of income for some cooperative members who could originally make up for the lack of agricultural income through sideline production. For another example, some agricultural cooperatives do not do a good job in labor planning, and lack comprehensive and long-term production arrangements for some elderly, weak, and disabled cooperative members who have weak labor or can still participate in labor to some extent; some cooperatives lack necessary care and support for some cooperative members who have strong labor but have difficult family lives and cannot often go to work; this prevents some cooperative members from exerting their labor potential, and they do less work than they could have, making it more difficult to increase income. Furthermore, for example, some cooperatives did not handle the means of production properly enough when establishing the cooperative, and absorbed into the cooperative scattered fruit trees, small fish ponds, lotus root ponds, or means of production for running small sideline businesses that could have been operated by individual cooperative members, which also affected the income of the owners.

    Here, it is not to place the responsibility for the possible reduction of income of a few cooperative members entirely on the leaders of agricultural cooperatives. This year is the first year of basically realizing agricultural collectivization on a national scale, and some agricultural production cooperatives have many special difficulties. Some large cooperatives were formed by merging several villages or several cooperatives, and the economic foundations of each village and cooperative are not completely the same. Some cooperatives are built around old cooperatives by absorbing a large number of individual farmers and expanding, and the economic foundations of new and old cooperative members are different. This year, all advanced cooperatives have absorbed the elderly, weak, and disabled households in the township into the cooperative, and the production base is still relatively weak. Under these circumstances, it is already not easy to strive for increased income for 90% of the cooperative members, and it is even more difficult to require increased income for every household. However, facing the fact that a few cooperative members will reduce their income, looking back and examining the past leadership work has many benefits. We can find solutions in the process of studying problems, so as to provide appropriate assistance and arrangements for households with reduced income, and also strengthen the confidence of households with reduced income in striving to increase income.

    More than half a year has passed, the overall situation of agricultural production has been determined, how many solutions can there still be? In fact, as long as the leadership of the agricultural cooperative attaches importance to this issue, there are still many solutions. For agricultural cooperatives in the north, although the autumn harvest is approaching in many areas, and some areas have already begun the autumn harvest, an agricultural year is coming to an end, but the autumn harvest season is the busiest season, there are many types of agricultural work, and the amount of labor required is very large, all kinds of labor can be arranged for production, and it is still possible to strive for households with reduced income to do a few more workdays in the autumn harvest. In most areas of the south, there are still nearly two months before the late rice harvest, and there is still much to be done to strive for increased production, and the possibility of striving for households with reduced income to have more income is even greater. What is particularly important is to help farmers who may have reduced income to operate some household sideline production that requires little capital and yields quick results. In agricultural work, all odd jobs, light jobs, jobs on the field, and jobs in vegetable gardens and orchards can be assigned reasonable quotas and appropriately assigned to them. Households that do not meet the "five guarantees" conditions but have very difficult lives can also be given appropriate care by paying part of the land remuneration. For some upper-middle peasant cooperative members who have more and stronger labor, it is necessary to analyze and study the specific reasons for their reduced income. If the handling of means of production into the cooperative is not appropriate or reasonable enough, it should be adjusted to be appropriate and reasonable. In short, as long as we think of more solutions in all aspects, and strive to maintain the previous year's income level for households that may have reduced income, or reduce the number of households with reduced income, there is still hope.

    Turning possible reduced income into the ability to maintain the previous year's income level, of course, also depends on the cooperative members who may have reduced income actively working and striving hard. Some cooperative members, because they see that they may have reduced income, become depressed, ideologically shaken, and not motivated to work. In addition to giving them more help in production and economy, the leaders of agricultural cooperatives should also enthusiastically care for them, conduct meticulous ideological education work for them, specifically analyze the reasons for their possible reduced income, and explain the development prospects of agricultural cooperatives, so that they understand: the reduced income this year is only a temporary phenomenon; as long as everyone works together to run agricultural cooperatives better, it will be possible to increase income for every household in the future.

    热情地关怀可能减少收入的少数社员
    本报评论员
    各地的农业生产合作社都试算了全年收入分配的账。从试算的结果看来，除了受灾比较严重的少数地区以外，绝大多数农业社都可以比过去增加生产，绝大多数社员都可能比去年增加收入。但是，一般社都有百分之几、有的社甚至有百分之十几的社员可能要比去年减少收入。对于这少数可能减少收入的社员，应该想些什么办法呢？
    有人说：没有办法；农业社建立不久，底子薄，困难多，能保证90％的社员增加收入就算不错了，少数社员不能增加收入是不可避免的事情。
    也有人说：农业生产合作社实行按劳取酬，收入减少的户都是由于劳动力弱或没有劳动力，就是增产再多，他们也分不到多少，有什么办法可想呢？
    的确，可能减少收入的少数社员，都是有特殊原因的。有的劳动力弱或者没有劳动力；有的家庭人口多劳动力不足；有的遇到天灾人祸突然丧失了劳动力；有的虽然有劳动力，但家庭生活困难，参加社里的生产比较少；有的土地多、生产资料多，入了高级社以后土地报酬取消了，但劳动力不多不强；也有少数人劳动不积极，参加社里的生产劳动不多，等等。少数社员由于以上种种原因，在办社的第一年可能减少收入，是难以避免的。争取他们不致减少收入，也确有很多困难。但是，如果因为难以避免、有困难就认为没有办法，而对他们采取漠不关心的态度，那就不对了。
    有些社员可能减少收入虽然有各自的特殊的原因，但这同农业合作社的领导方面经验不足、经营不善也或多或少地有些关系。例如，许多农业社忽视副业生产，特别是忽视帮助社员进行家庭副业生产，甚至限制社员经营家庭副业，这就使一些原来可以由经营副业弥补农业收入之不足的社员减少了收入的来源。又如，有些农业社劳动规划做得不好，对一些劳动力较弱或多少还能参加劳动的老弱残疾社员缺乏全面的长期的生产安排；有些社对一些劳力强但家庭生活困难、不能经常出工的社员缺乏必要的照顾和扶持；这就使一部分社员不能发挥劳动潜力，原可以多做些活却做少了，增加收入也就更困难了。再如，有些社在建社的时候，对生产资料的处理不够恰当，把本来可以由社员个人经营的零星果木、小块鱼塘、藕池或经营小宗副业的生产资料也吸收入社，这也影响了本主的收入。
    在这里，并不是要把少数社员可能减少收入的责任完全加到农业社领导干部身上。今年是全国范围内基本实现农业合作化的第一年，一些农业生产合作社有许多特殊的困难。一部分大社是由几个村、几个社合并建成的，各村、各社经济基础不完全相同。有一部分社是以老社为中心吸收大量单干农民扩大建成的，新老社员的经济基础不一样。今年所有高级社都吸收了本乡的老弱残疾户入社，而生产底子还比较薄。在这种种情况下，争取90％的社员增加收入已经不容易，要求户户增加收入就更不容易。但是，面对着少数社员将会减少收入的事实，回过头来检查一下过去的领导工作，是有很多好处的。可以在研究问题当中找出办法，以便对减收户进行适当的帮助和安排，还可以加强减收户争取增加收入的信心。
    时间已经过去大半年，农业生产大局已定，还能有多少办法呢？其实，只要农业社的领导方面把这个问题重视起来，办法还是不少的。对于北方的农业社来说，虽然许多地区秋收已经迫近，有些地区已经开始秋收，一个农业年度已经快要结束，但秋收季节是最繁忙的季节，农活的门类很多，需要的劳动量很大，各种各样的劳动力都可以安插到生产中去，争取减少收入户在秋收中多做几个劳动日，还是可能的。南方大部地区离晚稻收割还有近两个月时间，争取增产还大有可为，争取减收户多有些收入的可能性更大。特别重要的是帮助可能减少收入的农户经营一些本钱小收效快的家庭副业生产。在农活上，凡是零活、轻活、场上的活、菜园、果园的活都可以规定出合理的定额，适当地分配给他们做。一些不合乎“五保”条件但生活十分困难的户，也可以采取付给部分土地报酬的办法，给以适当照顾。对某些有较多较强的劳动力的上中农社员，要分析研究他们减少收入的具体原因。如果由于生产资料入社处理得不够恰当不够合理，就应该加以调整，做到恰当、合理。总之，只要从各方面多想办法，争取可能减收户保持去年的收入水平，或者把减收户的数量减少，还是有希望的。
    使可能减少收入变成可以保持去年的收入水平，当然还要依靠可能减收的社员本身积极劳动，努力争取。有些社员，因为看到自己可能要减少收入便情绪低落，思想动摇，劳动也不带劲了。农业合作社的领导方面，除了在生产上、经济上给他们更多的帮助以外，还要热情地关怀他们，对他们进行细致的思想教育工作，具体分析他们可能减收的原因，说明农业社的发展前途，使他们了解：今年减收只是暂时的现象；只要大家共同努力把农业合作社办得更好，以后就可以做到户户增加收入。
