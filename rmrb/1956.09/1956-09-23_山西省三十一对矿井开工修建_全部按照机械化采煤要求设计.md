Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, September 22nd:  The new construction, renovation, and restoration projects for thirty-one coal mine shafts in the major coalfields of Shanxi Province have now all commenced.

This year, the investment in mine construction in Shanxi Province is equivalent to the total investment completed in the past three years. Among them, twenty-eight pairs of mine shafts are projects above the quota limit. These mine shafts are distributed in the famous Datong Coalfield, Qinshui Coalfield, and Taiyuan Xishan Coalfield.

This year, the investment in new construction projects in Shanxi's coal mine construction has seen a huge increase. In 1952, the investment in new mine shafts accounted for only 12.5% of the total investment; this year, the investment in new mine shafts accounts for 34% of the mine construction investment. At the same time, all mine shafts newly built, renovated, and restored this year are designed according to the requirements of mechanized coal mining. These mine shafts will all have mechanized transportation equipment and tunneling and coal mining equipment.

Currently, three pairs of mine shafts have been handed over for production, including Huangshiban Pingdong (level adit), Si Kuang Si Chi (Fourth Mine Four Feet) inclined shaft, and Xuan Gang Coal Mine Huangjiabao Pingdong belonging to the Yangquan Mining Bureau. Before the end of this year, Datong Coal Mine's Yugou inclined shaft, Xinzhou Kiln vertical shaft, and Langergou inclined shaft will also be handed over for production.

According to the current construction progress estimates, by 1958, another ten pairs of newly built mine shafts, thirteen pairs of renovated mine shafts, and three pairs of restored mine shafts will all be handed over for production. After these mine shafts are put into production, the supply of coking coal, power coal, and civil coal from Shanxi Province to the whole country will greatly increase.

    山西省三十一对矿井开工修建
    全部按照机械化采煤要求设计
    新华社太原22日电　在山西境内各大煤田上，三十一对煤矿矿井的新建、改建和恢复工程，现在已经全部开工。
    今年，山西境内的矿井建设投资，相当过去三年完成投资的总和。其中二十八对矿井，是属于限额以上的工程。这些矿井分布在著名的大同煤田、沁水煤田和太原西山煤田上。
    今年山西煤矿建设工程中的新建工程的投资，有了巨大的增长。1952年新建矿井的投资只占全部投资的12.5％；今年，新建矿井的投资占到矿井建设投资的34％。同时，所有今年新建、改建和恢复的矿井，都是按照机械化采煤的要求设计的。这些矿井都将有机械化的运输设备和掘进采煤设备。
    现在，已经有三对矿井移交生产，其中有阳泉矿务局所属的黄石板平峒、四矿四尺斜井和轩岗煤矿黄家堡平峒。今年年底以前，还将有大同煤矿的?峪口斜井、忻州窑立井和狼儿沟斜井移交生产。
    根据目前的施工进度估计，到1958年，还将有十对新建矿井、十三对改建矿井、三对恢复矿井全部移交生产。这些矿井投入生产以后，山西境内供应全国的炼焦煤、动力煤和民用煤，将大大增加。
