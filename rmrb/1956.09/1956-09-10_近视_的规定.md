    Regulations on "Nearsightedness"
    It is said that the number of nearsighted students in Xi'an middle schools is increasing. A partial cause has been found. A certain middle school, in order to save electricity, stipulates: First, lights are not allowed to be turned on until it is dark. As a result, when it is about to get dark, students are still reading and doing homework outside the classroom, unable to enter the classroom. There is also a second regulation: one lamp is shared by eight people, and lights are not allowed to be turned on until everyone is present. The person who made such regulations is probably also "nearsighted," otherwise how could he not see what consequences this situation would cause?
    Saving is of course a virtue, but is such "saving" necessary? It seems that some people do not really understand the true meaning of these two words. Jin Ming

    “近视”的规定
    据说西安市中学生里近视眼越来越多。找到了一部分原因。某中学为了节约用电，规定：第一，天不黑不许开灯。于是，在天就要黑了的时候，学生们还在教室外边看书做作业，进不了教室。还有第二条规定：一盏灯八人共用，人到不齐不许开灯。作这样规定的人恐怕也是“近视”的，否则他怎么看不见这种情况会引起怎样的后果？
    节约当然是美德，然而是否需要这样的“节约”呢？看来，有些人其实并不懂得这两个字的真实意义。　金铭
