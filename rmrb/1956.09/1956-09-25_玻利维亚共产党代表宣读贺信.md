Bolivian Communist Party Representative Reads Letter of Congratulations

Dear Comrades of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Dear Delegates:

Please allow me to convey the congratulatory letter of the Bolivian Communist Party to your Eighth National Congress:

On behalf of all Communist Party members, workers and patriots of Bolivia, the Central Committee of the Bolivian Communist Party extends warm congratulations to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, to its outstanding leader Comrade Mao Zedong, and to all Party members attending the Eighth National Congress, expressing their profound admiration and love for the glorious Chinese people, and wishing you new and great achievements in socialist construction.

We regard the victory of the Chinese revolution as our own victory. The Chinese revolution has opened up new paths for the struggle for national liberation, and has once again confirmed that colonial and dependent countries are capable of defeating foreign oppressors and feudal reactionaries. The experience gained by the long-tested leader, the Communist Party of China, is extremely valuable to the Bolivian Communist Party, which is striving to unite the people of the whole country to overcome backward forces and national oppression.

In our country, we are working to break the isolation created by American monopoly capital and struggling to establish trade and cultural exchanges with all countries in the world; the attitude of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China and the people's democratic countries to peacefully resolve international problems, is helpful to our task.

The achievements we have made, as well as the lessons we can draw from the experience accumulated by the mature fraternal parties, will enable us to meet the needs of the Bolivian people.

The convening of your Eighth National Congress has aroused great expectations among the peoples of all countries struggling against imperialist oppression. The Bolivian Communists will watch the work and discussions of the Congress with concern and affection, and enthusiastically await the successful outcome of the Congress.

We congratulate the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, because this is a new victory in building socialism in a vast country of 600 million people, just as we congratulate a new victory for peace, the happiness and progress of all peoples.

Long live the Communist Party of China, the reliable and courageous leader of the Chinese people!

Long live the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China!

Glory belongs to the great Chinese people!

              Central Committee of the Bolivian Communist Party
                      La Paz (Bolivia)

    玻利维亚共产党代表宣读贺信亲爱的中国共产党中央委员会的同志们，亲爱的代表同志们：
    请允许我向你们第八次代表大会转达玻利维亚共产党的贺信：
    玻利维亚共产党中央委员会代表全体共产党员、玻利维亚的工人和爱国人士，向中国共产党中央委员会，向它杰出的领袖毛泽东同志以及全体参加第八次代表大会的党员致以热烈的祝贺，表达他们对光荣的中国人民深刻的钦佩和热爱的心情，并祝你们在社会主义的建设中取得新的巨大的成就。
    我们把中国革命的胜利看作是自己的胜利。中国革命为民族解放斗争打开了新的道路，再一次地证实了殖民地国家和附属国是能够击败外国压迫者和封建反动派的。久经考验的领导者，中国共产党，所取得的经验对于正在努力团结全国人民，以战胜落后势力和民族压迫的玻利维亚共产党是极其宝贵的。
    在我国，我们正在努力打破美国垄断资本所制造的我们的孤立状态，为和世界各国建立贸易和文化交流关系而斗争；苏联、中华人民共和国和各人民民主国家致力于和平解决国际问题，这种值得重视的态度，对于我们这个任务是有帮助的。
    我们所取得的成就，以及我们能够从已经成熟的各兄弟党所积累的经验中吸取的教益，将使我们能够满足玻利维亚人民的需要。
    你们第八次代表大会的召开，在为反对帝国主义的压迫而斗争的各国人民中间激起了巨大的期望。玻利维亚共产党人将关切地和敬爱地注视着大会的工作和讨论，热情地伫候着大会的圆满的结果。
    我们祝贺中国共产党第八次代表大会，因为这是在六亿人口的广大的国家内建设社会主义的一个新的胜利，也正像祝贺对于和平、各国人民的幸福和进步的一个新的胜利一样。
    中国人民的可靠的勇敢的领导者中国共产党万岁！
    中国共产党第八次代表大会万岁！
    光荣属于伟大的中国人民！
              玻利维亚共产党中央委员会
                      拉巴斯（玻利维亚）
                          一九五六年九月七日
