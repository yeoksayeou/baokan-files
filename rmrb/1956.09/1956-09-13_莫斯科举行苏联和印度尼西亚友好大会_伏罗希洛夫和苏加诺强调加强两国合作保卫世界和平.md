Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 12th. On September 11th, 100,000 Muscovites held a Soviet-Indonesian friendship rally at the Lenin Central Stadium. Kliment Voroshilov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, and Indonesian President Sukarno addressed the meeting.

The rally was opened by Zaitsev, First Deputy Chairman of the Moscow City Soviet. The first speaker at the meeting was Bushuyev, a famous lathe operator from the Likhachev Automobile Factory. Following him, Voroshilov addressed the rally.

Voroshilov's Speech

Voroshilov said that the Soviet Union and Indonesia are separated by vast oceans, hot deserts, and towering mountains. However, our dear guests have overcome all these obstacles to come and familiarize themselves with the lives of the Soviet people, and to tell us all that Indonesia, having gained independence from the shackles of colonialism, is willing to live in peace and friendship with our country, and is willing to work with us to consolidate world peace and the happiness of all peoples. The Soviet people understand this noble aspiration of the Indonesian people and their leaders very well. The Soviet people also respond with warm sympathy to our Indonesian friends.

The Soviet Union and Indonesia share a complete consensus on the major contemporary issues of concern to the people of the whole world – the issue of maintaining and consolidating universal peace and security. Both of our countries are actively fighting for peace and opposing military blocs.

Voroshilov continued, saying that it can be said with confidence that the people of all countries now desire peace and friendly coexistence. The people of no country desire war. However, it cannot be ignored that in some countries, there are still influential groups who make fortunes by selling arms, and their concern is to expand armaments and provoke conflicts between countries. They use political power and capital to put together aggressive blocs such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, and the Baghdad Pact. They are increasingly engaging in militaristic propaganda and poisoning people's minds, attempting to stir up hatred among people for the people of other countries.

In modern times, when the latest technology has greatly shortened the distance between countries, the anti-people actions of the enemies of peace are particularly dangerous. Now, the threat of war anywhere is a threat to the people of all countries. Precisely because of this, all people who cherish peace and security should be vigilant, unite their forces more closely, and strive to consolidate peace, stop the arms race, strive for disarmament and reduction of armed forces, and strive to resolve all international disputes through peaceful means.

In this regard, it should be pointed out that peace-loving countries now not only possess enormous moral strength in the struggle for peace, but also possess strong material strength sufficient to block the path of any aggression.

Voroshilov said that the significant achievements made by the forces of peace in recent times are largely due to the close cooperation of peace-loving countries, primarily the People's Republic of China, the Republic of India, the Republic of Indonesia, the Soviet Union, and many other countries. We call on all governments and peoples to contribute to this noble cause.

Voroshilov then spoke about the issue of anti-colonialism. He said that the issue of guaranteeing universal peace is inseparable from the issue of eliminating colonialism and its consequences. Under the impact of the powerful national liberation movement, colonialists have had to withdraw from most countries in Asia and some countries in Africa. However, even now they are not reconciled to admitting that they are powerless to stop the great historical process of people's liberation. Therefore, the people of all countries who have freed themselves from colonial shackles are determined not to stop the anti-colonial struggle until all forms of colonialism and its consequences are completely eliminated. This is entirely understandable.

The Indonesian people have traveled an uneven road in the struggle to establish their independence and freedom. Their struggle for independence is a brilliant and inspiring example of the increased national consciousness of the people of Eastern countries. Our working people sincerely hope that the Indonesian people will achieve further success, so that their beautiful motherland will achieve complete political and economic independence.

Voroshilov concluded by saying that President Sukarno's visit to the Soviet Union is a major and valuable contribution to the development of friendly relations between the Soviet Union and the Republic of Indonesia. The results of the exchange of views on issues of interest to both countries during his visit to Moscow show that the Soviet Union and Indonesia have the possibility and the common desire to develop political, economic, and cultural cooperation between our two countries for the happiness of the two peoples and for the benefit of world peace. President Sukarno's visit to the Soviet Union also has great international significance. It once again shows that what the people of all countries cherish most in contemporary times is not saber-rattling and threats of atomic bombs, but equal and friendly cooperation between the people of all countries, strict respect for their independence and sovereignty, and respect for their national customs and achievements as well as national culture. In international relations, only this path can be welcomed by the people of all countries.

Sukarno's Speech

President Sukarno then addressed the meeting. He first thanked the hosts for their enthusiastic speech and conveyed the respects of the 80 million Indonesian people to the Soviet people.

Sukarno then spoke in detail about the Indonesian people's national liberation struggle and condemned colonialism. He said, "Since 1908, we have launched a 'fervent struggle for national liberation'. We are carrying out our struggle with pride. Because the Indonesian people are fighting for the cause of justice, for the just cause of truth, freedom, and independence. The Indonesian people are deeply grateful to the people of all countries who support them in this struggle. The Indonesian people are also deeply grateful to the Soviet people in this regard.

Sukarno said, "You love freedom, and we Indonesian people also love freedom. You love socialism, and we also love it. You defend peace, and the Indonesian people also defend peace. Therefore, there is a solid and unbreakable spiritual connection between the Soviet and Indonesian peoples."

We have deep love for the people, deep love for the people of the whole world. The basis of this love is humanitarianism. In 1945, we established our republic on the basis of the Pancasila (Five Principles). We hope to coexist peacefully with all nations in the world, so we stubbornly and resolutely oppose any form of imperialism and colonialism. We oppose not only imperialism and colonialism in Indonesia, but also imperialism and colonialism throughout the world. We are always committed to friendship with the people of all countries in the world.

Sukarno continued, "The Republic of Indonesia held a meeting in Bandung with other countries in the spirit of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. Now, more than three-quarters of the world's population has expressed its approval of these five principles and is marching shoulder to shoulder towards the brilliant summit of eternal and lasting world peace."

Sukarno said, "The Soviet Union has long been world-renowned, but there are still some people in the world who do not know what the Soviet Union is all about. Some even say that the Soviet Union is keen on war, that the Soviet people like aggression, and that they want to threaten others. I have spent two weeks in the Soviet Union. I have traveled from north to south, and from south to north. I have met millions of people. Now I can tell the world that the Soviet people do not want war, the Soviet people love peace."

"Friends! I have been to other countries, I have met the people of other countries, and I can say that they also love peace." Two billion people throughout the world advocate peace. Only those who maintain imperialism, only the chieftains of capitalism and fascism, only the defenders of feudalism want war. Therefore, as long as the people of the world unite and unite their strength, the struggle for peace will surely be victorious.

Sukarno emphasized, "I have spent fourteen days in the Soviet Union, and I can say that the Soviet people truly desire peace and are working for peace. This is not because the Soviet Union is weak, but because the Soviet Union truly desires peace and is working for peace."

Sukarno said that the ideals that the Indonesian people are striving for are the same as those you are striving for. The Indonesian people's struggle has not yet been successful politically and economically. The Indonesian people's political struggle has not yet been successful because we are still fighting for West Irian, an indivisible part of the Republic of Indonesia. Economically, this struggle has not yet been successful because we are building a just and prosperous society. But we are moving forward, and we are proud that we have the support and sympathy of people all over the world, including the Soviet people, in our struggle.

"I know and firmly believe that the friendship between the Soviet and Indonesian peoples is a lasting and unbreakable friendship."

"After we return to Indonesia, we will be separated from you by thousands of mountains and rivers, but please believe that our hearts will be with you."

"Our hearts will be with you because we are fighting for the same ideals, because we both love freedom. We both love peace."

Voroshilov's and Sukarno's speeches were constantly interrupted by applause. After Sukarno finished speaking, the people at the meeting held up thousands of Indonesian and Soviet flags high. Motorcycles with the flags of both countries attached sped past the podium. Then, a team of athletes walked over, scattered across the stadium, and formed the words "Merdeka!" (Indonesian for "Freedom").

Also participating in the rally were Kaganovich, Malenkov, Mikoyan, Pervukhin, Saburov, Suslov, Brezhnev, Furtseva, Aristov, Pospelov, as well as Indonesian Foreign Minister Abdulgani and other members of Sukarno's entourage.

Diplomatic envoys from some countries stationed in Moscow and members of some foreign delegations visiting the Soviet Union also attended the rally.

    莫斯科举行苏联和印度尼西亚友好大会
    伏罗希洛夫和苏加诺强调加强两国合作保卫世界和平
    据新华社莫斯科12日电　9月11日，十万莫斯科市民在列宁中央运动场举行了苏联和印度尼西亚友好大会。苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席伏罗希洛夫和印度尼西亚总统苏加诺在会上讲了话。
    大会由莫斯科市苏维埃第一副主席扎伊采夫主持开幕。第一个在会上讲话的是利哈乔夫汽车工厂的著名车工布舒耶夫。接着，伏罗希洛夫向大会讲话。
    伏罗希洛夫的讲话
    伏罗希洛夫说，苏联和印度尼西亚两国之间隔着辽阔的海洋、炎热的荒野和高山峻岭。但是，我们亲爱的客人克服了这一切障碍，前来熟悉苏联人民的生活，并且告诉我们大家：摆脱了殖民主义桎梏而获得独立的印度尼西亚愿意同我国和平、友好相处，愿意同我们一道为巩固的世界和平和各国人民的幸福而奋斗。苏联人民很了解印度尼西亚人民和他们的领导人的这种崇高的愿望。苏联人民也以热烈的同情回答印度尼西亚朋友。
    苏联和印度尼西亚对全世界人民所关心的当代主要问题——维护和巩固普遍和平和安全的问题的看法完全一致。我们两国都为维护和平而积极斗争，都反对军事集团。
    伏罗希洛夫接着说，可以满怀信心地说，现在各国人民都希望和平和友好地相处。没有任何一个国家的人民是希望战争的。但是，不能忽视的是，在某些国家中，还有着靠军火买卖而发财的有势力的集团，他们关心的就是扩充军备和挑拨各国之间的冲突。它们利用政权和资本拼凑成了像北大西洋公约组织、东南亚条约组织和巴格达条约这一类侵略集团。它们越来越大规模地进行军国主义的宣传和毒害人们的思想，企图在人们当中挑起对别的国家人民的仇恨。
    在现代，当最新的技术已经大大缩短了国与国之间的距离的时候，和平的敌人的反人民行动就特别危险。现在，不论在哪儿发生的战争威胁都是对各国人民的威胁。正因为这样，一切珍视和平和安全的人们都应当提高警惕，更紧密地团结自己的力量，竭力争取巩固和平，制止扩充军备，争取裁减军备和武装力量，争取通过和平手段解决一切国际争执问题。
    在这方面应当指出，现在爱好和平的国家，在争取和平的斗争中，不仅掌握巨大的道义力量，并且掌握强有力的物质力量，足以阻挡任何侵略的进路。
    伏罗希洛夫说，近来和平力量之所以能够取得显著的成就，在很大的程度上是由于各爱好和平国家，首先是中华人民共和国、印度共和国、印度尼西亚共和国、苏联和许多别的国家的通力合作。我们呼吁一切政府和人民在这项崇高的事业中作出贡献。
    伏罗希洛夫接着谈到了反对殖民主义的问题。他说，保障普遍和平的问题是同肃清殖民主义及其后果的问题分不开的。在强大的民族解放运动的冲击下，殖民主义者不得不退出亚洲大多数国家和非洲某些国家。可是，直到现在他们还不甘心于承认无力阻挡人民解放的伟大历史进程。因此，摆脱了殖民地束缚的各国人民决心不停止反殖民主义的斗争，直到彻底肃清一切形式的殖民主义及其后果为止。这是完全可以理解的。
    印度尼西亚人在争取确立自己的独立和自由的斗争中走过了不平坦的道路。他们争取独立的斗争是说明东方国家人民民族觉悟提高的光辉和令人鼓舞的榜样。我国劳动人民真诚希望印度尼西亚人民获得进一步的成就，使他们美丽的祖国在政治上和经济上完全获得独立。
    伏罗希洛夫最后说，苏加诺总统这次访问苏联，对发展苏联和印度尼西亚共和国之间的友好联系说来是一个重大的珍贵贡献。在他访问莫斯科期间就两国感兴趣的问题交换意见的结果表明，苏联和印度尼西亚有可能、也有共同的愿望为两国人民的幸福、为世界和平的利益来发展我们两国的政治、经济和文化合作。苏加诺总统这次访问苏联也具有重大的国际意义。它再次表明，当代各国人民所极其珍视的不是耀武扬威和原子弹的威胁，而是各国人民的平等友好合作，严格地尊重他们的独立和主权，尊重他们的民族风俗和成就以及民族文化。在国际关系上，只有这种道路才能得到各国人民的欢迎。
    苏加诺的讲话
    苏加诺总统接着在会上讲了话。他首先感谢主人的热情的讲话，并且转达了八千万印度尼西亚人民对苏联人民的敬意。
    苏加诺随后详细地谈到了印度尼西亚人民的民族解放斗争，谴责了殖民主义。他说，从1908年起我们就展开“争取民族解放的火热斗争。我们是怀着自豪的心情来进行我们的斗争的。因为印度尼西亚人民是为正义的事业、为真理、自由、独立的正义事业而斗争。印度尼西亚人民深深感谢支持他们进行这一斗争的一切国家的人民。印度尼西亚人民在这一点上也深深感谢苏联人民。
    苏加诺说，你们热爱自由，我们印度尼西亚人民也热爱自由。你们热爱社会主义，而我们也热爱它。你们保卫和平，而印度尼西亚人民也保卫和平。因此，在苏联和印度尼西亚人民之间有一种巩固的和牢不可破的精神联系。
    我们对人民怀着深厚的爱，对全世界人民怀着深厚的爱。这种爱的基础是人道主义。1945年，我们以五基为基础建立了我们的共和国。我们希望同全世界各民族友好共处，因此我们顽强地、坚决地反对任何形式的帝国主义和殖民主义。我们不仅反对在印度尼西亚的帝国主义和殖民主义，而且反对全世界的帝国主义和殖民主义。我们永远致力于同世界上一切国家的人民友好。
    苏加诺接着说，印度尼西亚共和国同其他国家本着和平共处五项原则的精神在万隆举行了会议。现在，全世界已经有四分之三以上的人口表示赞同这五项原则，并肩走向永恒、持久的世界和平的灿烂顶峰。
    苏加诺说，“苏联老早已经举世闻名了，但是世界上还有一部分人不知道苏联是怎么回事。甚至有些人说，苏联热衷于战争，苏联人民喜欢侵略，他们想威胁别人。我在苏联已经过了两个星期。我从北到南，又从南到北。我遇到了千千万万的人。现在我可以告诉全世界，苏联人民不希望战争，苏联人民是热爱和平的。”
     “朋友们！我到过其他国家，我见到过其他国家人民，我可以说：他们也是热爱和平的。”全世界二十亿人都主张和平。只有维护帝国主义的人，只有资本主义和法西斯主义的魁首，只有封建主义的维护者才要战争。因此，只要全世界人民联合起来，团结起自己的力量，那么，争取和平的斗争一定会得到胜利。
    苏加诺强调说，“我在苏联过了十四天，我可以说，苏联人民真正希望和平，在为和平而努力。这不是因为苏联力量弱，而是因为苏联真正希望和平，并且为和平而努力。”
    苏加诺说，印度尼西亚人民努力争取的理想是同你们所争取的相同的。印度尼西亚人民的斗争在政治上和经济上都尚未成功。印度尼西亚人民的政治斗争之所以尚未成功，因为我们还在为印度尼西亚共和国不可分割的一部分——西伊里安而斗争。在经济上，这一斗争之所以尚未成功，因为我们正在建立一个正义、繁荣的社会。但是我们在前进，我们引为自豪的是，我们在斗争中得到了包括苏联人民在内全世界人民的支持和同情。
    “我知道并且深信，苏联和印度尼西亚人民之间的友谊是持久的、牢不可破的友谊。”
    “在我们回到印度尼西亚以后，我们和您们之间将相隔千山万水，可是请相信，我们的心将和您们在一起。”
     “我们的心将与您们在一起，因为我们为同一个理想而斗争，因为我们和您们都热爱自由。我们和您们都热爱和平。”
    伏罗希洛夫和苏加诺的讲话不断为掌声所打断。在苏加诺讲完话以后，到会的人们高高举起了成千面印度尼西亚和苏联的国旗。插着两国国旗的摩托车从主席台前疾驰而过。接着，运动员的队伍走了过来，他们散布在运动场上，组成“默迪加！（印度尼西亚语“自由”）的字样。
    参加这次大会的还有卡冈诺维奇、马林科夫、米高扬、别尔乌辛、萨布罗夫、苏斯洛夫、勃列日?夫、福尔采娃、阿里斯托夫、波斯伯洛夫，以及印度尼西亚外交部长阿卜杜加尼和苏加诺的其他随行人员。
    一些国家驻莫斯科的外交使节和正在苏联访问的一些外国代表团人员也参加了大会。
