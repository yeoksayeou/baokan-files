Xinhua News Agency, September 24th: Over nine hundred young people in Beijing attended the "Commemorative Meeting for the 75th Anniversary of Mr. Lu Xun's Birth and the 20th Anniversary of His Death" held by the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League tonight—the eve of the anniversary of Mr. Lu Xun's birth.

    The commemorative meeting was presided over by Hu Keshi, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League. In his speech, he said that Lu Xun will always be the best teacher for the younger generation. We commemorate him, and we must better learn his fighting spirit, his spirit of wholeheartedly serving the people, and the rich literary legacy he left us.

    Invited to participate in the commemorative meeting, Mr. Lu Xun's wife and comrade-in-arms, Xu Guangping, delivered a speech to the young people present, titled "Lu Xun and Youth."

    Xu Guangping said: Lu Xun's relationship with young people was very close. He always enthusiastically taught young people to recognize the truth and bravely participate in the revolutionary struggle, growing up in the storms of the revolutionary struggle. At the conference of the League of Left-Wing Writers, he put forward "creating a large group of new fighters" as a guideline. Especially in his later years, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, he led the youth in fighting the enemy with full confidence. When the enemy wanted to deal with progressive youth with arrests and killings, Lu Xun always tried his best to rescue them. He expressed unparalleled indignation at the reactionary rulers' crimes of killing young people. His articles mourning the sacrificed youth, such as "In Memory of Forgetting," were extremely sad and indignant.

    Xu Guangping said: How should we commemorate Lu Xun? First of all, we must learn Lu Xun's spirit of wholeheartedly serving the people. "Bowing down like a willing ox for the children" is one of his famous sayings. For the benefit of the motherland and the people, he worked sincerely and wholeheartedly all his life, never caring about personal gains or losses. After liberation, the vast majority of young people have understood the principle of serving the people, but this does not mean that all young people have a thorough understanding of this principle. A few young people still have incorrect ideas. Lu Xun was not born a proletarian fighter. It was only after many painful self-struggles and self-transformations that he transformed from a rebellious son and second-rate official of the gentry class into a heroic proletarian fighter. Lu Xun was like this, so can young people who have not undergone much training relax their vigilance over their own thoughts? Young people should constantly change their incorrect thoughts and truly achieve wholeheartedly serving the people.

    Xu Guangping said: To learn Lu Xun's spirit of wholeheartedly serving the people, we must learn his spirit of resolutely fighting against reactionary and backward forces. To protect the interests of the people, we must fight against things that harm the interests of the people. Lu Xun taught us that for the benefit of the motherland and the people, we must not be afraid of any difficulties and resolutely fight against reactionary and backward things. Young people need to greatly strengthen their fighting spirit. Are we still afraid of losing the mistakes and shortcomings in our work and thinking? Can we tolerate the existence of unreasonable phenomena? Lu Xun taught us to think independently. If we follow what others say on every issue, the result will be a lack of clarity between right and wrong, and it will be impossible to do things well. Advocating independent thinking does not mean advocating not learning Marxism-Leninism, because the ultimate goal of independent thinking is to discover objective truth, and Marxism-Leninism is the highest generalization of human production struggle and class struggle, and it is the scientific expression of objective truth.

    Finally, Xu Guangping expressed her hope that young people would learn Lu Xun's tenacious spirit of learning.

    The young people present expressed their gratitude for Xu Guangping's speech with long applause.

    At the end of the commemorative meeting, actors from the China Youth Art Theater recited Lu Xun's work "Clever Men, Fools, and Slaves."

    Hu Yaobang, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, also attended the commemorative meeting.

    团中央举办鲁迅先生诞生和逝世纪念会
    据新华社24日讯　北京九百多个青年在今晚——鲁迅先生诞生纪念日前夕，参加了青年团中央举办的“鲁迅先生诞生七十五周年、逝世二十周年纪念会”。
    纪念会由青年团中央委员会书记处书记胡克实主持。他致词说，鲁迅永远是青年一代最好的导师。我们纪念他，并且要更好地学习他的战斗精神，学习他全心全意为人民服务的精神，学习他留给我们的丰富的文学遗产。
    应邀参加纪念会的鲁迅夫人和战友许广平以“鲁迅和青年”为题，向到会青年讲话。
    许广平说：鲁迅和青年的关系是非常亲密的。他始终热诚地教导青年去认识真理，英勇地参加革命斗争，在革命斗争的风暴中成长起来。他在左翼作家联盟大会上曾把“造成大群的新战士”当作一条纲领提出。特别在后期，他在中国共产党的领导下，满怀信心地领导着青年和敌人斗争。当敌人要用逮捕和屠杀来对付进步青年时，鲁迅总是尽力营救他们，他对反动统治者杀害青年的罪行，表示了无比的愤恨，他为哀悼牺牲了的青年写的文章“为了忘却的纪念”等篇，都悲愤到极点。
    许广平说：怎样来纪念鲁迅呢？首先要学习鲁迅全心全意为人民服务的精神。“俯首甘为孺子牛”是他的一句名言，他为了祖国和人民的利益，诚诚恳恳、全心全意地工作了一辈子，从来没有计较过个人得失。解放后，绝大部分青年都已经懂得了为人民服务的道理，但不等于说所有的青年都对这道理懂得很透，少数青年还存在着不正确的思想。鲁迅并不是一生下来就是无产阶级战士，他是经过许多痛苦的自我斗争和自我改造之后，才从绅士阶级的逆子贰臣转变为无产阶级的英勇战士的。鲁迅尚且如此，没有经过多少锻炼的青年能够对自己的思想放松不管么？青年们应该不断地改变自己不正确的思想，真正做到全心全意为人民服务。
    许广平说：要学习鲁迅全心全意为人民服务的精神，就必须学习他向反动、落后势力坚决斗争的精神。要保护人民利益就必须和危害人民利益的东西作斗争。鲁迅教导我们为了祖国和人民的利益，要不怕任何困难，向反动落后的东西作坚决斗争，青年们需要大大地加强斗争性，难道我们还害怕丢掉自己工作中和思想上的错误和缺点吗？难道能够容忍不合理的现象存在吗？鲁迅教导我们要独立思考。如果对于什么问题，都是人云亦云，结果是非不明，不可能把事情办好。提倡独立思考，并不是主张不学马克思列宁主义，因为独立思考的最终目的是为了发现客观真理，而马克思列宁主义就是人类生产斗争和阶级斗争的最高概括，是客观真理的科学表现。
    最后，许广平希望青年们学习鲁迅顽强的学习精神。
    到会青年用长时间的鼓掌来对许广平的讲话表示谢意。
    纪念会最后由中国青年艺术剧院演员朗诵鲁迅的作品“聪明人和傻子和奴才”。
    青年团中央委员会书记处书记胡耀邦也参加了纪念会。
