    Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, September 17th: The Chairman of the Egyptian Suez Canal Authority, Badawi, said on the evening of September 16th that the piloting work of the Suez Canal, which has been carried out by Egyptian pilots since September 15th, has been "very successful."
    September 16th was the second day that Egyptian pilots were responsible for piloting after a large number of foreign pilots from Britain, France and other countries collectively resigned. On this day, in accordance with the new measures promulgated by the Egyptian government, there were a total of two piloting operations, one northbound and one southbound. The pilots were responsible for guiding ships from one end of the canal to the other. In the past, there were four piloting operations a day, and the pilots would be replaced by another shift of pilots when they guided the ships to the midway station of Ismailia. Like September 15th, although the number of pilots and piloting operations had been reduced, on this day the Egyptian pilots and some Greek pilots who supported Egypt still successfully guided the same number of ships through the Suez Canal as in the past.

    粉碎英法破坏航运阴谋
    埃及领航员顺利执行任务
    据新华社17日讯　开罗消息：埃及苏彝士运河管理委员会主席巴达韦16日晚上说，从9月15日以来由埃及领航员负责的苏彝士运河领航工作是“十分成功的”。
    9月16日是在英、法等大批外国领航员集体辞职后由埃及领航员负责领航的第二天。这一天继续按照埃及政府颁布的新办法，共领航两次，即北行和南行各一次，领航员负责从运河的一端引到另一端。过去是每天领航四次，领航员在把船只引到运河的中途站伊士美利亚时即由另一班领航员接替。同9月15日一样，虽然领航员和领航次数已经减少，埃及领航员和支持埃及的一些希腊领航员在这一天还是把同过去一样多的船只顺利地引过了苏彝士运河。
