    The Party Has Reunited My Family
    Ren Dian

    The "Mid-Autumn Festival" is a festival symbolizing reunion. This year's Mid-Autumn Festival is even happier and more meaningful for me, because on this day I was reunited with my family members who had been separated for more than twenty years.

    I work at the Supply and Marketing Cooperative in the suburbs of Suzhou City, Jiangsu Province. I am twenty-five years old this year, and I was born into a very poor family. When I was eighteen months old, my father, who was a cook, fell ill. My mother sold all the clothes and furniture, but still couldn't make ends meet. Under these desperate circumstances, she hardened her heart and, with tears in her eyes, sent my eldest brother to Jinshan Temple to become a young monk, and gave me away to someone else. Soon after, my father died under the torment of poverty and disease; my mother also left her hometown with her three children and wandered to other places. Our family was thus scattered.

    I grew up with my foster father and foster mother. From the daily conversations of people, although I suspected that I was not their biological child, no one had told me the truth. After liberation, on the eve of my foster father's death, he told me that he was not my biological father, but he did not state my biological father's name or address. From then on, I was determined to find my relatives.

    In April of this year, when I applied to join the Party in my organization, I begged the Party organization to entrust relatives to inquire about the past from my foster mother. Because of the length of time, she had forgotten my father's name, and could only talk about some clues.

    I told the organization and comrades these clues, and asked them to help me find them. Under the care of the organization and comrades, on May 29th of this year, I finally learned that my biological mother, brother, and sister were all in Shanghai, and they were living well. When I heard this news, I was moved to tears!

    Now, our family has been reunited, which is a great joy in my life. In order to thank the Party and Chairman Mao for bringing me happiness, I must work harder in the future and strive to become a member of the Communist Party of China.

    党使我骨肉团圆了
    任玷
    “中秋节”是一个象征团圆的节日，今年的中秋，对我来说，是一个更加幸福、更加有意义的节日，因为在这天我和我的分离二十多年的亲人团聚了。
    我在江苏省苏州市城郊供销合作社工作，今年二十五岁，出身在一个非常贫困的家庭里。当我长到十八个月的时候，做厨师的父亲病倒了，母亲把衣服、家具卖完当光，还是没法维持生活。在这种不得已的情况下，她狠起心肠、含着眼泪把我大哥送到金山寺做小和尚，把我送给了人家。不久，父亲就在穷困和疾病的折磨下死去了；母亲也带着三个孩子离开家乡，流浪到外地。我们一家人就这样的离散了。
    我跟着寄父和寄母长大了，从日常人们的谈话中，我虽然也怀疑我不是他们亲生的孩子，但是也没有谁向我说过事情的真相。解放后，寄父临死的前夕，才向我说他不是我的亲生父亲，但是他没有说明我生父的姓名、地址。从此，我就下定决心，要设法找到我的亲人。
    今年4月份，我在机关里申请入党的时候，就恳求党组织委托亲戚向我寄母询问过去的情况。因为时间太久，她已经将我父亲的姓名忘记了，只能谈出一些线索。
    我把这一点线索告诉组织和同志，请求他们帮我找寻，在组织和同志的关怀下，今年5月29日，我终于知道我亲生母亲和哥哥、姐姐都在上海，他们生活得很好。当听到这个消息的时候，我感动得流下了眼泪！
    现在，我们已经骨肉团聚了，这在我一生中是一件极大的喜事，为了要答谢党和毛主席给我带来的幸福，我一定要在今后工作中加紧努力，争取做一个中国共产党党员。
