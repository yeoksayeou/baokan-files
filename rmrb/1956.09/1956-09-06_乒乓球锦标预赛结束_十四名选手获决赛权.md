Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, September 5th. The preliminary rounds of the 1956 National Table Tennis Championships concluded on the evening of the 4th. Eight male and six female athletes secured their places in the finals, which will begin on the 6th.

On the evening of the 4th, last year's national champion, Jiang Yongning, after a fierce battle in the final preliminary round, defeated Guangzhou's Li Renzu by a score of three to two, securing his place in the finals. Jiang Yongning won five and lost one of his six preliminary matches, earning first place in his group.

The other male players who secured first place in their preliminary groups were Wang Xitian (fourth place last year), Wang Chuanyao (sixth place last year), and Liu Guozhang, who won third place in the 1956 Twelve-City Workers' Table Tennis Championships. The players who secured second place were Zhuang Jiafu of Beijing (eleventh place last year) and Hu Bingquan (thirteenth place last year), Liang Zhitou of Guangzhou (seventh place last year), and Lin Jinyuan (eighth place last year).
