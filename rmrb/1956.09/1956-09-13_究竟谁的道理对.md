    “Whose Reasoning is Right”
    The *Hebei Daily* conducted a discussion on "Whose Reasoning is Right?" continuously from July 25th to August 27th. The matter under discussion was that Wu Zhangzhong, a member of the Wangkuai Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xingtai County, asked the production team leader for leave because he didn't have time to manage his "private plot." His request was denied, but he squeezed out some time to grow vegetables, and was criticized by the production team leader for being "selfish and self-serving" and was fined eight work points. Yao Jingzhen, the director of the cooperative, believed that Wu Zhangzhong's unauthorized leave and disregard of labor discipline, such selfish behavior deserved the criticism and fine. Was Wu Zhangzhong truly selfish and self-serving? Or were the cooperative cadres not concerned about the lives of the members? During the discussion, the newspaper received a total of 266 submissions, and the newspaper finally reached a conclusion.
    Some important ideological questions were raised in this discussion. For example, the article "Is it Because the Members' Awareness is Low?" analyzed whether the conflict between individual interests and collective interests is objectively existent or due to the members' low level of awareness. Some people in the discussion proposed that the conflict between the collective interests of the cooperative and the individual interests of the members is due to the members' low level of awareness. Some cooperatives therefore handled matters based on the members' level of awareness. For example, the cooperative would not allocate "private plots" to cadres and members with high awareness, but only to members with low awareness, in order to temporarily take care of their personal interests. Once their awareness was raised, the "private plots" would be taken back. Others disagreed with this view and practice, arguing that the interests of the cooperative could not yet completely encompass the personal interests of the members, and that the cooperative's development of production and the members' desire to improve their lives could not yet be fully adapted. Therefore, the contradiction between the collective interests of the cooperative and the individual interests of the members objectively exists, and is not a matter of the members' level of awareness. Although the members' level of awareness can narrow or widen this contradiction, it cannot fundamentally eliminate it. The article pointed out that some cooperatives only take care of the personal interests of members with low awareness and not the personal interests of members with high awareness, which is wrong. Treating the members' level of awareness as the root cause of the conflict between individual and collective interests will lead cooperative cadres to unilaterally conduct so-called awareness-raising education for the members, instead of studying the actual problems in the members' lives.
    There were many different opinions in the discussion. For example, some believed that the member Wu Zhangzhong's opinion was correct; some agreed with the director Yao Jingzhen's view; some advocated that members should have "private plots"; some disagreed; some believed that individual interests and collective interests were fundamentally opposed and could not be combined; others believed that they could be well combined.
    After the advanced cooperatives were formed, the phenomenon of rural cadres excessively emphasizing collective interests and neglecting the individual interests of the members was relatively common. The *Hebei Daily* seized on a typical case to conduct a discussion, educating cooperative cadres to care about the lives and hardships of the members, which was very timely and necessary.

### “究竟谁的道理对”

    “究竟谁的道理对”
    河北日报从7月25日至8月27日连续进行了“究竟谁的道理对”的讨论。讨论的事情是邢台县王快村农业生产合作社社员吴章仲因为没有时间经营“自留地”，向生产队长请假不准，自己挤了些时间去种菜，被生产队长批评为“自私自利”，罚了八个工分。该社社主任姚景振认为吴章仲请假不准，随便离开，违反劳动纪律，这样自私自利的行为被批评和罚是应该的。到底是吴章仲自私自利呢？还是社干部不关心社员生活呢？在讨论中，报纸共收到了二百六十六件来稿，报纸最后作了结论。
    这个讨论中提出了一些重要思想问题。如“是因为社员觉悟低吗？”一文中就分析了个人利益与集体利益发生矛盾到底是客观存在的呢？还是社员觉悟低呢？讨论中有人提出社的集体利益与社员个人利益发生矛盾是因为社员觉悟低，有的合作社因此就按社员觉悟高低来办事，比如，社里不分“自留地”给社干部和觉悟高的社员，只分给觉悟低的社员，目的为了暂时照顾他们的个人利益，等他们觉悟提高了，再抽回分给他们的“自留地”。也有人提出不同意这样
  的看法和做法。认为社的利益还不能完全包括社员的个人利益，合作社发展生产与社员提高生活的要求还不能完全适应。因此，社的集体利益与社员个人利益的矛盾在客观上是存在的，不是社员觉悟高低的问题。虽然，社员觉悟高低能够缩小或者扩大这个矛盾，但是不能从根本上消灭这个矛盾。文章指出了有些合作社只照顾觉悟低的社员的个人利益，不照顾觉悟高的社员的个人利益的做法，是不对的。把社员觉悟高低看作个人利益与集体利益发生矛盾的根源，就会使社干部片面地向社员进行所谓提高觉悟的教育，而不去研究社员生活上的实际问题。
    在讨论中有很多不同意见。比如，有的认为社员吴章仲的意见对；有的同意社主任姚景振的看法；有人主张社员应该有“自留地”；有人不同意；有的认为个人利益与集体利益根本对立，无法结合；有的却认为可以很好结合。
    高级合作化后，农村干部过分强调集体利益忽视社员个人利益的现象是比较普遍的。河北日报抓住典型事例，进行讨论，教育社干部关心社员的生活和疾苦，这种作法是很及时和必要的。
