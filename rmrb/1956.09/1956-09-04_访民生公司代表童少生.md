    Interview with Tong Shaosheng, Representative of Minsheng Company
    By our reporter Cao Baoming
    Why did Minsheng Shipping Company apply to merge with the Changjiang Shipping Bureau?  I interviewed Tong Shaosheng, the representative of the private side of the jointly-owned Minsheng Company, who explained this to me in detail.

    Tong Shaosheng first discussed the company's operating situation in the first half of the year. He said, "Since Minsheng Company implemented fixed interest on fixed shares in January this year, our transportation business plan has been integrated with the Changjiang Shipping Bureau. In the past, it was often difficult for Minsheng Company to complete its financial profit plan in the first quarter of each year. This year, the freight rate was also reduced by 25%, so it was estimated that it would be even more difficult to complete the plan. Unexpectedly, in the initial unified operation, Minsheng Company not only exceeded its financial profit plan for the first quarter but also completed its annual financial profit plan in the first six months. On the one hand, this is due to the increase in cargo volume after the upsurge of socialism. On the other hand, it is also because the efficiency of transportation tools has been fully utilized after the initial unified operation. For example, in the past, the Sichuan River was navigated by a tugboat towing one barge, mainly because of the dangers of the Kongling and Xietan rapids, which made it impossible to tow double barges. This year, the plan was to change the Sichuan River to one tug towing double barges, but the river water was particularly dry. The Changjiang Shipping Bureau specially dispatched two tugboats to assist the passing fleets in the dangerous areas, which doubled the efficiency of the Sichuan River tugboats. This is the benefit of unified operation. The Yangtze River has always had more passengers and cargo upstream and less downstream. In the past, there was often a shortage of transportation capacity on the one hand and a surplus on the other. After the initial unified operation, because the business transportation plan is common, the Changjiang Shipping Bureau, in addition to maintaining a part of the direct ships on the Han-Yu line, in order to maximize the performance of the Sichuan River ships, allowed these ships to run exclusively on the Yi-Yu section, and also transferred a part of the ships from the downstream to run exclusively on the Han-Yi section, implementing joint operation. In this way, it not only met the upstream demand for transport capacity, but also made full use of the downstream transport capacity.

    Then he analyzed the characteristics of inland waterway transportation, saying, "Shipping is different from other industries and commerce. Factories and shops can operate independently without interfering with each other, but the four shipping units (including the Changjiang Shipping Bureau) operate separately on the same Yangtze River route. The source of goods is also the same, so the mutual influence is very large. If there is no unified command and dispatch, it will be chaotic. Since 1953, although the Changjiang Shipping Bureau has implemented unified dispatch, unified sources of goods, and unified port operations, solving many problems, because each unit operates separately, and everyone has to complete their own business transportation plan, there are still many contradictions. Disputes often arise over the allocation of goods, ship scheduling, and port utilization. In particular, in order to take care of the completion of the plan by each unit, the efficiency of ships often cannot be fully utilized, and the number of cargo transshipments is also increased, resulting in slow circulation and large losses, which is completely incompatible with the current situation of continuous increase in transportation volume. At the same time, Minsheng Company has business institutions in Chongqing, Yichang, Hankou, and Shanghai, which overlap with the institutions of the Changjiang Shipping Bureau, resulting in a large waste of personnel. Therefore, the merger of Minsheng Company's business institutions with the Changjiang Shipping Bureau is necessary, whether from the perspective of transportation needs or from the experience of the first half of this year. Only in this way can the potential of the Yangtze River shipping be brought into full play and adapt to the situation of socialist construction. " He finally talked about the state's care for the private personnel of the joint state-private transportation industry, expressing his gratitude. He said, "Our board of directors passed a resolution: we firmly support the central government's further socialist transformation of Minsheng Company."

    访民生公司代表童少生
    本报记者　曹葆铭
    民生轮船公司为什么要申请同长江航运局合并经营呢？记者访问了公私合营民生公司资方代表童少生，他向我详细地解答了这个问题。
    童少生首先谈到今年上半年公司经营的情形，他说：“民生公司从今年1月实行定股定息以后，我们的运输营业计划便和长江航运局合在一起。过去，民生公司每年第一季度的财务利润计划往往很难完成，今年又降低了运价25％，估计完成计划更有困难。谁知在初步统一经营中，民生公司不仅第一季度超额完成了财务利润计划，而且在上半年六个月中已完成了全年财务利润计划。这一方面固然是社会主义高潮以后，货源增多了；另一方面也是因为初步统一经营后，运输工具的效能得到了充分发挥。举例来说，往年川江都是由一个拖轮带一个驳船，主要是因为崆岭与泄滩两处水险，没法拖双驳。今年计划川江改为一拖带双驳，可是江水又特别枯竭，长江航运局便专门调了两个拖轮在水险的地方协助过往的船队，使川江拖轮的效能提高了一倍。这就是统一经营的好处。长江一贯是上游客货多，下游少，过去往往是一方面运输力不足，另一方面却有多余。在初步统一经营后，由于营业运输计划是共同的，长江航运局除了保持一部分汉渝线的直航船外，为了尽量发挥川江轮船的性能，让这些船专跑宜渝段，另外再从下游调一部分船专跑汉宜段，实行联营。这样，不仅满足了上游对运力的需要，也充分利用了下游的运力。
    接着他分析内河航运的特点说：“航运跟别的工商业还不一样，工厂、商店都可单独经营互不干扰，但四个航运单位（包括长航局）同在长江一条航线上分散经营，货源也是同一来源，相互影响就很大，如不统一指挥调度就会混乱。从1953年起，虽已由长江航运局实行统一调度，统一货源与统一港湾作业，解决了不少问题；但是因为各单位分散经营，谁都要完成自己的营业运输计划，矛盾仍然很多，时常为货源分配、船舶调度、港湾利用等许多问题发生争论。特别是为了照顾各个单位都完成计划，往往使船舶效能不能充分发挥，货物转口的次数也因此增多，流通慢、损耗大，与目前运量不断增加的形势完全不能适应。同时，民生公司在重庆、宜昌、汉口、上海都设有业务机构，与长江航运局机构重叠，人员浪费很大。所以，民生公司业务机构合并于长江航运局，无论从运输需要或从今年上半年的经验来看，都是必要的。只有这样，才能发挥长江航运的潜力，适应社会主义建设的形势。他最后谈到国家对公私合营运输业资方人员的照顾，表示非常感激。他说：“我们的董事会通过一个决议：坚决拥护中央对民生公司进一步进行社会主义改造。”
