A Good Example of Properly Settling Demobilized Soldiers
    Lian Zhishui, Cheng Wanguo

    From 1954 to the end of 1955, Changzhi People's Hospital in Shanxi Province successively received 29 demobilized soldiers to work in the hospital. These comrades, after being assigned to the hospital, were mentally stable and worked actively. They not only quickly became familiar with their work but also improved rapidly in their actual work. Twelve comrades, including Liu Jinyao and Wang Shizheng, were elected as model workers by all hospital staff (three hospital-wide models and nine department/office models). Why did the demobilized soldiers working at Changzhi People's Hospital progress quickly and achieve outstanding results?

    Proper Settlement

    Changzhi People's Hospital treated the reception of demobilized soldiers as if they were welcoming relatives. Each time demobilized soldiers were received, the Party branch first convened a hospital-wide staff meeting to inspire the staff to love and enthusiastically help the demobilized soldiers. This was followed by specific preparations, such as preparing housing, furniture, etc., for the demobilized soldiers. After the demobilized soldiers arrived, the hospital's Party and government leaders had cordial conversations with them to understand their situations and introduce their work. As a result, the demobilized soldiers felt the same warmth upon entering the hospital as they had in the military.

    Assigning Dedicated Personnel to Help

    In order to enable the demobilized soldiers to quickly become familiar with their work and better delve into their professional skills, the hospital leaders, while assigning work to the demobilized soldiers, also assigned dedicated personnel to help them understand the situation and become familiar with their professional skills. To ensure that teaching and learning could be sustained for a long time, the method of mutually signing contracts, guaranteeing teaching and learning, was also adopted. This method achieved good results in helping demobilized soldiers improve their professional skills. For example, Comrade Hu Shangzhi was originally a "half-baked" pharmacist in the army. After being transferred to Changzhi People's Hospital, he signed a contract guaranteeing teaching and learning with the veteran pharmacist Tan Jingyun. He studied whenever he had time, and in just over half a year, he went from being a "half-baked" pharmacist to a "fully qualified" pharmacist. Comrades, seeing Hu Shangzhi's rapid progress, reflected, "The guaranteed teaching and learning method works wonders. 'Half-baked' Hu Shangzhi became an expert in six months." Du Wanshun, a demobilized soldier working in the ophthalmology department, was a doctor in the army, but his skills were not high enough. After arriving at Changzhi Hospital, he signed a contract guaranteeing teaching and learning with Doctor Luo Jinchang. With Luo Jinchang's enthusiastic help, his skills improved rapidly, and he is now also a relatively skilled doctor in the ophthalmology department.

    Emphasis on Cultivation

    Changzhi People's Hospital also attaches great importance to cultivating and improving cadres, especially the cultivation of demobilized soldiers. Because the hospital leaders were considerate of the fact that demobilized soldiers had fought in numerous battles in the past and did not have enough time to study, they adopted the method of "filling in whatever is lacking, learning whatever is low." In the past two years, more than 20 demobilized soldiers have been successively sent to cadre cultural supplementary schools, provincial Party schools, medical technology schools, spare-time Party schools, and political spare-time schools to study. This has greatly improved the work ability of demobilized soldiers. For example, Comrade Liu Guanghe had a very low level of education when he first came to the hospital after demobilization, and he could not even write ordinary receipts. After studying at the cadre cultural supplementary school for more than a year, he has now reached the level of senior primary school. The difficulties he encounters in his daily work have decreased, and his work efficiency has improved. Zhu Chuntian, deputy chief of the personnel section, used to have a low theoretical level and often ran into obstacles in his work. The leaders sent him to the provincial Party school to continue his studies and improve his theoretical knowledge. Ma Guozhi and four other comrades were intermediate medical officers in the army, but their skills were not as good as those of local medical officers. They studied at the medical advanced training school for half a year and greatly improved their medical skills. They now have the level of intermediate medical officers. In addition, the Party and government leaders of the hospital are also very concerned about the political life of demobilized soldiers. All 29 demobilized soldiers have been introduced to participate in trade union organizations, and Wang Shizheng, Jiang Xuehua, and five others have become Party development and cultivation targets.

    Caring for Their Lives

    Changzhi People's Hospital also pays great attention to solving the practical problems in the lives of demobilized soldiers. In the past two years, they have successively helped ten unmarried comrades, including Yang Jicheng, find like-minded partners; helped nine comrades, including Wu Yongbo, bring their families from other places; and helped eight comrades, including Cui Wenbin, solve the problem of their children's schooling and hiring nannies. In particular, they took out 1,730 yuan in relief funds to solve the life difficulties of twelve comrades, including Wen Chunyuan. Cui Wenbin, a demobilized soldier, had to support a family of six, and in addition to his children and wife being sick, he owed hundreds of yuan in debt that he could not repay. He carried a debt burden in his mind, which affected his work and study. After the leaders discovered this, they promptly conducted investigations and used 300 yuan in relief funds to solve his debt problem. Cui Wenbin said gratefully: "Under the leadership of the Communist Party, there are relatives everywhere. The hospital leaders not only helped me bring my whole family here, but also completely solved my debt problem. I will do my best to do my job well to repay the care of the Party and the government for me."

    Not Relaxing Political and Ideological Work

    Changzhi People's Hospital has also not relaxed its political and ideological work on demobilized soldiers. Holding forums is a good method for the hospital's Party branch to conduct ideological education for demobilized soldiers. At each forum, criticism and self-criticism were carried out, and everyone was called upon to put forward rationalization proposals to improve the hospital's work. For example, at one forum, Liu Jinyao and Liu Zhenwen were praised for their active work and good relations with the masses; at the same time, Hu Shangzhi and Yang Jicheng were criticized for being arrogant and complacent, having a rigid style of work, and being sloppy in their lives. In this way, learning models were established for all demobilized soldiers, and matters that should be paid attention to in the future were pointed out. They said happily: "The local leaders are exactly the same as the army leaders. Merits and demerits are clearly pointed out, and good and bad are clearly distinguished. Only in this way can we make progress faster!" For example, at another forum, demobilized soldiers revealed problems such as the pharmacy's failure to delegate authority to cadres and poor management of the ward's food, and suggested that the leaders formulate and improve the learning system to eliminate medical accidents. The Party and government leaders accepted these criticisms and suggestions, promptly corrected the shortcomings in the pharmacy's work and food management, and formulated specific measures to improve work, such as hospital regulations and learning systems.

    In the past two years, Changzhi Hospital has held eight forums for demobilized soldiers. A total of nine cases of good people and good deeds have been praised, four cases of bad behavior have been criticized, and 42 rationalization proposals have been accepted. This has played a significant role in educating and improving demobilized soldiers and improving the work of the entire hospital.

    妥善安置复员军人的好榜样
    连治水　程万国
    山西长治人民医院，从1954年到1955年底，先后接收了复员军人二十九人到医院工作。这些同志被分配到医院后，思想安定，工作积极。不仅很快地熟悉了业务，而且在实际工作中很快地有了提高。刘进耀、王世正等十二个同志并被全院职工评选为模范工作者（全院模范三名，科、室模范九名）。为什么在长治人民医院工作的复员军人进步快，工作成绩突出呢？
    妥善安置
    长治人民医院是把接收复员军人当做迎亲人一样看待的。每次接收复员军人时，都首先由党支部召开全院职工大会，启发职工群众爱戴和热诚帮助复员军人。接着就进行具体准备工作，如给复员军人准备住房、家具等等。复员军人来到以后，医院的党政负责同志就和他们亲切地交谈，互相了解情况，介绍工作等。因此复员军人一进医院的大门就感到和部队上一样的温暖。
    派专人帮助
    为了使复员军人很快地熟悉工作，更好地钻研业务，医院的领导方面在给复员军人分配工作的同时，就分派专人帮助他们了解情况，熟悉业务。为使教和学能长期坚持，还采用了互订合同，包教保学的办法。这个办法在帮助复员军人提高业务水平上取得了良好的效果。比如，胡尚志同志，原在部队是个“半把手”的司药员。转业到长治人民医院后，和老司药员檀经云订了包教保学合同，有空就学，只半年多的时间，就由一个“半把手”的司药员，变成了个“全把手”的司药员了。同志们看到胡尚志进步快，反映说：“包教保学作用大，‘半把手’的胡尚志，六个月变成了老行家。”在五官科工作的复员军人杜万顺，原在部队时就是医生，但是技术不够高，到长治医院后和医生罗锦昶订了包教保学合同，经罗锦昶的热心帮助，他的技术提高很快，现在也成了五官科的较熟练的医生了。
    重视培养
    长治人民医院也很重视培养提高干部，特别重视对复员军人的培养。因为医院的领导方面体贴到复员军人过去南征北战，没有足够的时间学习，所以对他们采取了“缺啥补啥，啥低学啥”的办法。二年来先后保送二十多名复员军人分别到干部文化补习学校、省委党校、医务技术学校、业余党校、政治业余学校学习。这样大大提高了复员军人的工作能力。比如刘广和同志，刚复员来医院时，文化程度很低，连普通单据都写不来；在干部文化补习学校学习了一年多，现在已达到了高小程度。他在日常工作中遇到的困难少了，工作效率提高了。人事科副科长朱春田，过去理论水平低，在工作中常碰钉子，领导方面就保送他去省委党校继续深造，提高理论知识。马国志等四个同志过去在部队是中级医士，但是技术不如地方上的医士。他们在医务进修学校学习了半年，在医疗技术上大有提高，现在已经具备了中级医士的水平。此外，医院的党政领导上对复员军人的政治生命也非常关心，二十九名复员军人都先后被介绍参加了工会组织，王世正、江雪花等五人已成为党的发展培养对象。
    关心他们的生活
    长治人民医院也非常注意解决复员军人实际生活中问题。两年来先后帮助杨积成等十个没有结婚的同志找上了知心的爱人；帮助吴用波等九个同志从外地接来了家属；帮助崔文斌等八个同志解决了子女上学问题和请保姆问题；特别是拿出了救济款一千七百三十元解决了温春元等十二个同志的生活困难。复员军人崔文斌，负担一家六口人的生活费，再加上子女和爱人闹病，欠了外债好几百元没法偿还，在思想上背上了债务包袱，影响了工作和学习。领导上发觉后，及时进行了解，用三百元的救济款，解决了他的债务问题。崔文斌感激地说：“在共产党的领导下，到处都是亲人，医院领导上不但帮助我接来了全家人口，而且还彻底解决了我的欠债问题，我要以百倍的努力做好工作，来回答党和政府对我的关怀。”
    不放松政治思想工作
    长治人民医院也并没有放松对复员军人进行政治思想工作。召开座谈会就是这个医院党支部对复员军人进行思想教育的良好方法。在每次座谈会上，都开展批评和自我批评，号召大家提合理化建议，改进医院工作。比如在一次座谈会上，表扬了刘进耀、刘振文工作积极，群众关系好；同时批评了胡尚志、杨积成高傲自满，作风生硬，生活散漫。这样，就给全体复员军人树立了学习榜样，指出了今后应注意的事项。他们高兴地说：“地方领导和军队首长一模一样，功过指的明，好坏分的清，只有这样，才能使我们更快的进步！”又如，在一次座谈会上，复员军人揭发出药房使用干部不放手，病房伙食管理不善等问题，并建议领导上制订和改进学习制度，消灭医疗事故。党政领导接受了这些批评和建议，及时纠正了药房工作和伙食管理上的缺点，制订出住院条例、学习制度等改进工作的具体措施。
    两年来长治医院召开了八次复员军人座谈会。共表扬了好人好事九起，批评了不良行为四起，还接受了四十二条合理化建议。这对教育提高复员军人以及改进全院工作都起了很大作用。
