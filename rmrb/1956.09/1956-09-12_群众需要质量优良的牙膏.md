    The masses need high-quality toothpaste
    "Black & White" Toothpaste Should Maintain its Reputation
    "Black & White" toothpaste, which has always been known as a famous brand, has had its quality decline recently. This spring, I bought a tube, and the lead casing broke after only a few days of use. Recently, I bought another tube, and when I opened the box at home, the lead casing already had cracks. After using it for less than ten days, five holes had appeared. At the same time, the "Black & White" toothpaste I bought was too thin, a bit like rice soup. I hope you can quickly find a way to improve it. Zhao Wenzhang
    "Solid Teeth Spirit" Toothpaste is Uneven in Hardness
    Not long ago, I bought a tube of "Solid Teeth Spirit" toothpaste produced by the Shanghai Wanguo Chemical Industry Company. After using about three-quarters of it, it suddenly became like water, flowing straight out when the opening faced down. After using it four or five more times, it became very hard again. What is the reason for this? Ye Shuli
    "Chang Le" Toothpaste Easily Deteriorates
    Recently, I bought two tubes of "Chang Le" brand toothpaste produced by the local state-owned Jilin Daily Chemical Factory at the Hulan County Department Store. After using half of it, the paste turned grayish-black and had a foul odor. I am worried that this toothpaste may be poisonous. I hope the relevant departments will inspect and test this toothpaste and urge this factory to improve product quality.

    "Changbai" Toothpaste Has a Spicy Taste
    "Changbai" toothpaste, produced by the local state-owned Andong Household Chemical Factory, has a major flaw: it has a spicy taste in the mouth. It also has the problem of being too thin. As soon as you move it slightly, the paste flows out like thin porridge.

    What Kind of Toothpaste is Good Toothpaste?
    Recently, the People's Daily has received letters from readers criticizing certain toothpastes for having little foam and no fragrance. These readers believe that toothpastes with more foam and fragrance are good toothpastes. We believe this view is not entirely appropriate.
    According to oral hygiene common sense, the purpose of brushing teeth is mainly to clean the teeth and remove food residue from the gaps between the teeth. Because these residues rot and ferment in the mouth, they have an erosive effect on the teeth and can also cause other oral diseases. At the same time, brushing can also prevent gum inflammation. After the rotten substances in the mouth are removed, it can also prevent the production of odors. Brushing mainly requires the use of a reasonable toothbrush and mastering the correct brushing method. Toothpaste and tooth powder only play an auxiliary role. Without toothpaste or tooth powder, using refined salt and salt water can also achieve these purposes.
    Our requirements for good toothpaste should be: no impurities, fine particles, so as not to wear down the teeth; no chemical effect on the teeth (causing the tooth surface to be rough, discolored, etc.), no irritation to the oral mucosa; and appropriate sterilization and disinfection effects. Some toothpastes have more soap powder, which can certainly produce a lot of foam, but it does not have much effect on cleaning the teeth. On the contrary, too much soap powder may also cause the gums to turn red. As for fragrances, they only play a role in regulating the odor of toothpaste and tooth powder and should not be overemphasized. Beijing Municipal Stomatological Hospital

    群众需要质量优良的牙膏
    黑白牙膏应该保持荣誉
    一向被称为名牌货的黑白牙膏，最近质量不大好。今春我买了一支，使用没有几天，铅皮就破裂了。最近我又买了一支，回家打开纸盒一看，铅皮就有裂口，使用没有十天，就破了五个口子。同时，我买的黑白牙膏膏浆太稀，有点像米汤一样。希望赶快设法改进。 　	赵文章
    固齿灵牙膏软硬不匀
    不久以前，我买了一支上海万国化学工业社出产的固齿灵牙膏。用掉四分之三左右，突然变得像水一样，口朝下就直往外流。再用过四、五次以后，又变得非常坚硬。这究竟是什么原因呢？　叶树立
    长乐牙膏爱变质
    最近，我在呼兰县百货公司买了两支地方国营吉林日用化学工厂生产的长乐牌牙膏。使了一半，膏浆就呈灰黑色，而且有一股臭味。我担心这种牙膏可能有毒。希望有关部门对这种牙膏进行检查、化验，并督促这个厂提高产品质量。

    长白牙膏有辣味
    地方国营安东家用化学厂出品的长白牙膏有个很大的缺点，是放到嘴里有一股辣味道。它还有一个毛病是太稀了。只要用手轻轻地动一下，膏浆就像稀粥一样流出来。

    什么样的牙膏是好牙膏？
    最近，人民日报收到一些读者的来信，批评某些牙膏泡沫少，没有香味。这些读者认为泡沫多、味香的牙膏才是好牙膏。我们认为，这种看法不太恰当。
    按口腔卫生常识来讲，刷牙的目的，主要是要洁净牙齿和清除牙齿间隙的食物残渣。因为这些残渣在口腔中腐烂发酵以后，对牙齿有侵蚀作用，还可以引起其他的口腔病。同时，刷牙还可以避免牙肉发炎。口腔中的腐坏物质清除以后，还可以防止产生臭气。刷牙主要要使用合理的牙刷，掌握正确的刷牙方法，牙膏、牙粉只起辅助作用。不用牙膏、牙粉，用精盐和盐水，也能达到这些目的。
    我们对好牙膏的要求，应该是：没有杂质，颗粒细小，以免磨损牙齿；对牙齿没有化学作用（使牙面粗糙、变色等），对口腔粘膜没有刺激性；有适当的杀菌消毒作用。有些牙膏里，肥皂粉多些，固然能起很多泡沫，但对洁净牙齿作用不太大，相反的，肥皂粉过多，还可能使牙肉发红。至于香料，也只是起些调节牙膏、牙粉异味的作用，不必过于强调。　北京市口腔医院
