The effectiveness of Traditional Chinese Medicine in treating leprosy
Cao Bu

Leprosy has always been considered a dangerous and difficult-to-treat chronic infectious disease. It is caused by prolonged and close direct or indirect contact with patients, leading to the entry of Mycobacterium leprae into the human body. Leprosy is not an incurable disease; it can be treated and cured. In the past, China used chaulmoogra and its oils, and modern drugs such as sulfones and thiourea, which had some effect on early-stage patients.

Since its establishment, the Liaoning Provincial Leprosy Hospital has been using drugs such as sulfones and thiourea to treat leprosy. In May 1955, inpatients reported to the hospital leadership that taking Western medicine was not as effective as taking Chinese medicine before admission and requested the hospital to consider hiring a Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioner for treatment. Because the hospital's leading cadres and medical staff conscientiously studied the Party and government's policies towards Traditional Chinese Medicine and highly valued patients' opinions, in June, they hired Guo Lisheng, an experienced Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioner from Fushun who had experience in treating leprosy. He cooperated with the Western medicine doctors in the hospital and selected twenty different types of leprosy patients for treatment. After two months of clinical trials, it was proven that the use of Traditional Chinese Medicine treatment was indeed very effective. In terms of symptoms, most patients had a significant reduction in facial swelling, nodules gradually flattened, areas that had lost sensation regained sensation, damaged areas of the skin gradually healed and recovered, and the skin color gradually returned to normal. The effect was indeed more significant and faster than taking sulphone drugs. When the patients in the hospital saw the efficacy of Traditional Chinese Medicine in treating leprosy, they all requested the hospital to consider completely switching to Traditional Chinese Medicine treatment. From September 15, 1955, except for a small number of patients who continued to be treated with sulphone drugs due to their significant effect, most patients gradually switched to Traditional Chinese Medicine treatment according to the patient's condition and medical resources. As of mid-March of this year, a total of 309 people had been treated by Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioners, accounting for approximately 90% of all inpatients. According to preliminary observations of the patients' conditions, the effective rate reached 99%, and the effective rates based on bacterial examination and pathological sections also reached 83.5% and 81.5% respectively. Such a high treatment effect is rare.

Among these 309 cases, clinical symptoms showed significant improvement after taking the medicine, as early as five days, as late as three months, generally in about a month. For example, patient Zheng Ziting had suffered from leprosy for more than four years. When he was admitted to the hospital in August 1955, his face was purplish-blue and swollen, with large and small nodules on his face, his eyebrows had fallen out, and patches of infiltrating numbness appeared on his limbs, chest, back, and arms. Smear examination of damaged tissue revealed a large number of leprosy bacilli, indicating verrucous leprosy. After admission, Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioner Guo Lisheng used Chinese medicines such as Xiaofeng San, Zaizao San, Tongfeng San, and Huanji San for treatment based on his condition. After a month, the patient's breathing was smoother than before, the swelling and nodules on his face gradually subsided and flattened, and his condition began to improve. Four months later, the nodules on his face flattened, the swelling subsided, the erythema and damage disappeared, sensation returned to most numb areas, and his skin color approached normal, and his appearance was much better than before. Tissue examination: most of the leprosy bacilli had become fragmented, and pathological examination proved that inflammatory infiltration had significantly improved. Another example is patient Huo Guiying, who had also suffered from leprosy for more than four years. When she was admitted to the hospital in March 1955, large patches of erythema appeared on the outside of her left face, neck, scapula, and both thighs, with numbness and lack of sweating, swelling and paralysis of her lips and left face, inability to straighten her right hand, and many numb patches on her limbs. She also suffered from pain in her left leg and had difficulty walking. Pathological section examination and diagnosis both proved that she had tuberculoid leprosy. After admission, she had taken dapsone orally for five months, and there was no change other than a slight fading of the lesion color. In September, she switched to treatment by Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioner Guo Lisheng. Guo Lisheng used Chinese medicines such as Xiaofeng San, Zaizao San, Huanji San, Mofeng Wan, and Tuifeng San for treatment. After two months, the lesion color significantly faded and subsided, and the numb area gradually regained sensation. Six months later, all symptoms of systemic lesions disappeared except for residual slightly white patches on the skin, the numb area completely regained sensation, the right hand could be straightened, was flexible and strong, and she did not feel tired even after walking more than ten miles. Another example is patient Zhang Chaofu, whose knee joint was bent and could not be straightened, and he had been bedridden for seven years. After taking Chinese medicine for two months, his knee joint flexion improved, and he was able to stand with support from a wall.

Traditional Chinese Medicine has a long history in the treatment of leprosy. There are early records of leprosy in ancient Chinese medical literature. The "Nei Jing" (Inner Canon of Medicine) says in the "Wind Theory" chapter: "If wind and cold stay in the meridians and do not leave, it is called leprosy wind." "Leprosy means that there is abundant 'rong' qi (nutritive qi), and heat swells the qi, which is not clear, so that the nasal pillar is damaged and the color deteriorates, and the skin ulcerates." In the Qing Dynasty's "Yizong Jinjian" (Golden Mirror of Medical Orthodoxy), not only were the causes and symptoms recorded, but also treatment plans were proposed: "Leprosy is caused by the environment of a place, by contagion, or by self-imprudence. At the first sign of this disease, take Wanling Dan to induce sweating, then take Shenying Xiaofeng San, Zhuifeng San, and Mofeng Wan in order. ... If it is in the upper part of the body, take Zuixian San, if it is in the lower part of the body, take Tongtian Zaizao San, and if the bridge of the nose collapses, take Huanji San." The Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioners at the Liaoning Provincial Leprosy Hospital are treating patients according to these prescriptions recorded in these documents and five proven prescriptions such as "Kushen San" based on the treatment principle of "dispersing wind and removing dampness, promoting blood circulation and resolving toxins."

In March of this year, the China Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine sent Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioners to conduct an investigation of this work in conjunction with relevant parties. They preliminarily affirmed that the treatment effect of Traditional Chinese Medicine on leprosy is much better than that of sulphone drugs and thiourea. It is not only faster and shorter in duration of treatment, but also has fewer reactions and no damage to blood cells.

    中医治疗麻风病的效果
    曹步
    麻风病一向被人们认为是一种险恶难治的慢性传染病。它是由于长期、密切地同病人直接或间接接触，致麻风杆菌钻入人体而感染的。麻风病并不是不治之症，它是可以治疗，而且是可以治好的。过去我国使用的大枫子及其油类和现代使用的砜类药，氨硫脲等药物，对初期病人都有一定的效果。
    辽宁省麻风病医院自成立以来一直采用砜类药，氨硫脲等药物治疗麻风病。1955年5月间，住院病人向医院领导方面反映，服用西药，不如入院以前服用中药来得有效，请求医院考虑聘请中医治疗。由于医院的领导干部和医务人员认真学习了党和政府对待中医的政策，非常重视病人的意见，6月间，从抚顺聘来了治疗麻风病有经验的中医师郭利生。他同医院里的西医团结合作，选择了二十个不同类型的麻风病人，进行治疗。经过两个月的临床实验，证明使用中药治疗的效果确实很好。在症状方面，病人大部分脸上的浮肿有了显著的消退，疙瘩也逐渐平复，失去知觉的地方也恢复了知觉，皮肤损害了的部分也逐渐愈合复原，皮肤的颜色也逐渐恢复正常，比服砜类药物的效果确实显著并且快得多。医院里的病人看见中医治疗麻风病有如此的疗效，都要求医院考虑完全改请中医治疗。从1955年9月15日起，除了一小部分病人服用砜类药物效果显著继续用砜类药物进行治疗以外，大部分病人根据病人的情况和医疗力量陆续改请中医治疗。到今年3月中旬为止，共有三百零九人由中医负责进行了治疗，约占全院病人的90％。根据对病人病状的初步观察，有效率达99％，经过细菌检查和病理切片观察，有效率也分别达到83.5％和81.5％。这样高的治疗效果，为历来所少见。
    在这三百零九个病例中，服药后早的五天，迟的三个月，一般在一个月左右，临床症状都有显著的好转。如病人郑子亭，患麻风病已经四年多。1955年8月入院治疗的时候，脸色青紫、浮肿，脸上生有大大小小的疙瘩，眉毛也掉了，四肢、胸和背部、臂部出现一片一片浸润性的麻木斑，下肢浮肿。损害组织涂片检查发现有大量麻风杆菌，是一种疣型麻风病。入院以后，郭利生中医师根据病情用中药消风散、再造散、通风散、换肌散治疗，一个月以后，病人呼吸比过去通畅，脸上的浮肿和疙瘩逐渐消退平复，病情开始好转。四个月以后，脸上的疙瘩平复，肿胀消退，红斑和损害现象消失，多数麻木区知觉恢复，皮肤颜色接近正常，外貌也比过去好看多了。组织检查：麻风杆菌大部分已成断碎状，病理检查证明炎性浸润已有显著好转。又如病人霍桂英，患麻风病也有四年多的历史。1955年3月入院治疗的时候，左侧面颈和肩胛以及两大腿的外部生有大片红斑，麻木、不出汗，嘴唇和左脸浮肿麻痹，右手不能伸直，四肢也生有许多麻木斑，左腿疼痛，走路感到很困难，病理切片检查和诊断都证明是似结核型麻风病。入院以后，曾内服氨苯砜，五个月后，除病灶颜色稍微转淡以外，其它毫无变化。九月改由郭利生中医师治疗。郭利生中医师用中药消风散、再造散、换肌散、磨风丸、退风散治疗，经过两个月，病灶颜色显著转淡消退，麻木区逐渐恢复知觉，六个月以后，全身病灶除残留皮肤微白斑以外，其它症状全部消失，麻木区知觉完全恢复，右手可以伸直，灵活有力，步行十几里也不觉得疲劳。又如病人张朝福因膝关节弯曲不能伸直，卧床不起已七年，服中药两个月以后，膝关节弯曲好转，并且能够扶墙站立。
    中医治疗麻风病已有悠久的历史。在我国古代医学文献上早就有关于麻风病的记载。内经风论篇说：“风寒客于脉而不去，名曰疠风。”“疠者，有荣气，热胕其气不清，故使其鼻柱坏而色败，皮肤疡溃。”在清代“医宗金鉴”中不仅记述了病因、病状，而且提出了治疗方案：“麻风，一因风土所生，一因传染，一因自不调摄。此证初觉，即服万灵丹汗之，次宜神应消风散、追风散、磨风丸次第服之。……在上部则服醉仙散，在下部则服通天再造散，若鼻梁塌坏用换肌散服之。”辽宁省麻风病医院的中医就是根据这些文献所记载的几个处方和“苦参散”等五个验方，根据“疏风祛湿、活血解毒”的治疗原则进行治疗的。
    今年3月，中医研究院曾派中医师协同有关方面对这个工作进行考察，初步肯定了中医对麻风病的治疗效果比砜类药、氨硫脲等药物好得多，它不仅见效快，医疗的时间短，反应也小，对血球也没有损害。
