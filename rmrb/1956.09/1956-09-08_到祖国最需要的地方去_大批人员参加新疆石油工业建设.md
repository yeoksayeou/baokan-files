Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, September 6th (Xinhua Reporter Wang An) - Technical personnel, workers, cadres, and young students from all over the country are continuously arriving at the Kelamayi-Wuerhe oil region and Urumqi and other petroleum industrial construction areas. In the past few days, a fast drilling team, a group of surveyors, and mechanical workers have arrived in Urumqi from Yumen Oilfield, Xi'an, Shanghai, and Jiangxi. A pipeline installation team of several hundred workers and a test production team will also arrive soon. In the previous five months, more than 6,000 people from all over the country and various parts of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region have participated in petroleum industrial construction. By the end of this year, several thousand more employees of all ethnic groups will be added.

In the growing petroleum industrial construction team in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, there are cadres, young students, skilled workers, and truck drivers from geology, petroleum industry, and machinery fields from Beijing, Shanghai, Xi'an, Guangdong, Sichuan, and Northeast China. There are oil testing teams, fast drilling teams, and surveying teams from Yumen Oilfield and Qaidam Basin. There are demobilized officers and soldiers from Hebei and Shandong provinces, and there are young people and students of Uygur and Kazakh ethnicities from rural and pastoral areas of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.

People of all ethnic groups throughout the country have shown great enthusiasm for supporting the construction of the petroleum industry in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. Among the thousands of demobilized officers and soldiers participating in petroleum construction, Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members account for approximately 70%; some of them came immediately to the side of the oil derrick as soon as they were demobilized, while others, after being demobilized and participating in agricultural production cooperatives and establishing their own homes, signed up to participate in petroleum industrial construction. Hundreds of young students from Shanghai and Sichuan resolutely demanded to work in the relatively arduous Kelamayi oil region before leaving their hometowns. In the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, more than 1,600 young people and students of Uygur, Kazakh, Hui, and other ethnic groups have signed up to participate in petroleum industrial construction in the past few months, including hundreds of students equivalent to junior high school level.

    到祖国最需要的地方去
    大批人员参加新疆石油工业建设
    新华社乌鲁木齐6日电　新华社记者王安报道：来自全国各地的技术人员、工人、干部和青年学生，源源不断地到达克拉玛依——乌尔禾油区和乌鲁木齐等地石油工业建设地区。最近几天，从玉门油矿、西安、上海和江西等地陆续到达乌鲁木齐的，有一个快速钻井队、一批测量人员和机械工人；还有一个数百名工人的管线安装队和一个试采队，也将在最近到达。在这以前的五个月中，来自全国各地和新疆维吾尔自治区各地参加石油工业建设的，已经有六千多人。到今年年底，还要增加数千名各族职工。
    在新疆维吾尔自治区日益壮大的石油工业建设队伍中，有来自北京、上海、西安、广东、四川和东北等地的地质、石油工业、机械等方面的干部、青年学生、技术工人和汽车司机，有来自玉门油矿和柴达木盆地的试油队、快速钻井队和测量队，有来自河北和山东等地的复员军官和士兵，有来自新疆维吾尔自治区农村和牧区的维吾尔、哈萨克族的青年和学生。
    全国各地、各族人民对支援新疆维吾尔自治区石油工业建设，表现了极大的热情。参加石油建设的数千名复员官兵中，共产党员和青年团员共约占70％；其中一部分是刚刚复员就立即来到了石油井架的旁边，另外一部分是在复员参加了农业生产合作社、建立了自己的家园以后，又报名参加了石油工业建设。从上海、四川来的数百名青年学生，有的在离开家乡以前就坚决要求一定要到比较坚苦的克拉玛依油区去工作。新疆维吾尔自治区境内的维吾尔、哈萨克、回族等各民族青年、学生，几个月来报名参加石油工业建设的已经有一千六百多名，其中有数百名是相当于初中程度的学生。
