"Testing" and "Being Tested"
    He Pingzhi

In our lives, when a person applies to join the Party or the League, the Party or League organization often first examines their political qualities through their specific actions in work and study, and investigates their loyalty to the Party or League organization and the revolutionary cause. In the process of testing loyalty, the tester (often an organization or leading cadre) examines the tested through review and investigation to achieve the purpose of understanding and education. They are responsible not only to the organization, the country, and the people, but also to the tested. The tested accept the test in order to receive further help and training, and to improve their class consciousness and political level. Therefore, the tested generally accept the test humbly and sincerely. So, whether it is the tester or the tested, their attitude towards the test is loyal, and their goals are consistent. All proceed from the revolutionary interests of the organization, the country, and the people, and such testing is beneficial and necessary.

However, things are not always like this. "Testing" is often used by some organizations or leading cadres today as a synonym for irresponsibility towards those being tested. They do not treat those being tested with a loyal attitude, but often use the excuse of "testing" to ignore the legitimate demands of the masses, thereby frustrating people's political enthusiasm and initiative. The most obvious example of this is the complaint of Lei Daisheng, published in the China Youth Daily on July 26th, about being "tested" beyond the age limit:

Lei Daisheng, starting in March 1953 (when she was only twenty-three years old), submitted her application to join the League three times in three years to the League organization of her work unit (Hubei Provincial Transportation Bureau, now Hubei Provincial Highway Department), not just verbally, but in writing. However, unfortunately, the leading cadres of the League organization only said some irrelevant or evasive words such as "It's good that you submitted the application, you still have to work hard according to your conditions," "I just took over," "I know," etc., without doing any specific work, and put Lei Daisheng's League membership issue aside for a long time without resolving it. It wasn't until February 1956, when Lei Daisheng was transferred to study and requested a resolution again, that the League branch secretary told her the following conclusion: "Lei Daisheng already has the qualifications to join the League and can be absorbed as a member, but this comrade is already twenty-five years old, so the higher League committee instructed the bureau League branch to transfer Lei Daisheng's relevant materials to the Transportation Bureau Party General Branch to allow Lei Daisheng to create conditions under the Party's cultivation." The League branch secretary also told her that she had to accept this "greater test."

The main responsibility for Lei Daisheng's failure to join the League has already been pointed out by the China Youth Daily as "to be borne by the Ninth Branch Committee of the Hubei Provincial Directly Subordinate Organs and the Hubei Highway Department League organization." I don't want to mention any more opinions on this point. However, what needs to be asked here is: According to this League branch secretary, Lei Daisheng's application to join the League, lasting three years, delayed and unresolved, should be a small test, or a not-so-small test, right? But whether it is a small test or a not-so-small test, Lei Daisheng being tested from the age of twenty-three to the age of twenty-five and beyond the age limit, besides permanently shutting Lei Daisheng out of the League's door and cutting off her League political life, what good does it do for the organization, the country, or the people?

In fact, for the League organizations of Hubei Provincial Highway Department and other units, the "test" of Lei Daisheng is rather a "test" of themselves, because from this matter, it is enough to see that the attitude of these League organizations towards those being tested is disloyal. This disloyal attitude is bound to be opposed by people. I hope these League organizations will accept the lessons of this "test"!

    “考验”与“被考验”
    何平治
    在我们生活中，一个人要求入党、入团，党、团组织往往事先要通过这个人的工作、学习等方面的具体行动审查其政治品质，考察其对党、团组织，对革命事业是否忠诚。在忠诚的考验过程中，考验者（往往是组织或者领导干部）对被考验者通过审查考察，以达到了解和教育的目的，他们不但对组织、国家、人民负责，而且对被考验者负责。被考验者接受考验，以获得进一步的帮助与培养，提高阶级觉悟和政治水平。因此，被考验者一般是虚心诚恳的乐于接受考验的。所以说，不论考验者或被考验者，对考验的态度都是忠诚的，目标是一致的。都是从组织、国家和人民的革命利益出发，这样的考验是有益的，也是必要的。
    但是事情并不完全如此。“考验”却也往往被今天一些组织或领导干部用为对待被考验者不负责任的代名词。他们不是以忠诚的态度对待被考验者，而往往借口“考验”为辞，漠视来自群众的正当要求，以致挫折了人们政治上的积极性和进取心。这种情况，最明显的可举7月26日中国青年报上刊载雷岱生被“考验”到超龄的申诉事实为例：
    雷岱生在1953年3月（这时她才二十三岁）起，三年中向所在工作单位（湖北省运输局，现为湖北省公路厅）的团组织，口头不算，书面就递上过入团申请书三次，要求入团，但可惜的是团组织的领导干部只是说了些不着边际或者推托的话“你递了申请书很好，根据你的条件还得努力”“我刚接手”“我知道了”等等，而不做具体工作，就将雷岱生的入团问题长期搁置起来，不作解决。直到1956年2月雷岱生因调出学习，再次提出要求解决时，团支部书记才告诉她一个结论如下：“雷岱生已具备入团条件，可以吸收为团员，但该同志年龄已到二十五岁，因此，上级团委指示局团支部把雷岱生的有关材料转到运输局党总支去，再让雷岱生在党的培养下去创造条件”。团支部书记还告诉她说，要接受这一次“更大的考验”。
    雷岱生一直没能入团的主要责任，中国青年报已经指出，“是要由湖北省直属机关第九分团委和湖北公路厅团组织来负的”。关于这点我不想再提什么意见。不过，在这里还需要问一问的是：照这位团支部书记的说法，雷岱生的申请入团，历时三年，拖延未决，该是一次小考验，或者是不大不小的考验了吧！？但小考验也好，不大不小的考验也好，雷岱生由二十三岁考验到二十五岁超龄，除了永久将雷岱生关在团的大门外面，断送了她的团的政治生命外，对组织、对国家、对人民有点什么好处呢？
    其实，对湖北省公路厅等单位的团的组织来说，对雷岱生的“考验”，毋宁说是对他们自己的“考验”，因为从这件事情足以看出这些团组织对待被考验者的态度是不忠诚的。这种不忠诚的态度，必然遭到人们的反对。希望这些团组织接受这次“考验”的教训吧！
