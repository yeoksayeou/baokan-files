    Actively Mobilize Transportation Resources to Support Disaster Areas
    On September 1st, the Anhui Daily published an editorial entitled "Quickly Send Production and Disaster Relief Materials to Disaster Areas." The editorial stated: Since the beginning of summer, the Huaibei region has suffered from successive instances of waterlogging and typhoon attacks, and the disaster situation is very serious. Although the Anhui Provincial Party and government leading bodies have organized forces to transport large quantities of materials to the disaster areas, the materials that have been transported to the disaster areas are far from meeting the needs. At present, disaster victims urgently need food, coal, medicines, agricultural tools, etc., and the latest time for planting wheat is only a little over a month away. This situation shows that the tasks of the material supply and transportation departments are very heavy.
    The editorial stated: The main problem in the current disaster relief material transportation work is the large task and insufficient transportation capacity. The main way to solve this contradiction is: the transportation department actively mobilizes transportation forces to support the Huaibei region, rapidly restores the highways damaged by floods, and opens up new routes for transporting materials. Shipping, highway, and railway departments should actively improve the turnover rate of vehicles and ships, make full use of modern and folk transportation tools, and strive to ensure that vehicles and ships are connected to ensure that materials are not delayed on the way.
    The editorial also pointed out that the material supply department should strengthen the planning of allocation and transportation work, proceed from the overall interests, and allocate and transport large quantities of wheat seeds, grain, coal, oil, and salt needed by the disaster areas at present, and moderately take into account other materials. At present, some material supply departments one-sidedly emphasize the transportation costs of their own units, and refuse to hand over materials for land transportation when water transportation is crowded and land transportation is idle; some areas ignore the needs of other areas, and there are also phenomena of detaining ships and wasting vehicles. These departmentalist practices should be opposed. In short, in the areas where production and disaster relief materials are shipped, transited, and received, all forces should be mobilized and used according to the principle of serving the needs of the disaster areas, and efforts should be made to deliver the materials to the disaster areas as soon as possible.

    积极调动运输力量支援灾区
    9月1日，安徽日报发表了以“赶快把生产救灾物资送到灾区去”为题的社论。社论说：淮北地区入夏以来，连遭内涝和台风袭击，灾情十分严重。安徽省党政领导机关虽曾组织力量把大批物资运送灾区，但是已经运到灾区的物资还远不能满足需要。目前，灾民急需口粮、煤炭、药品、农具等，而种麦的最晚时间也只有一个多月了。这种情况说明，物资供应和运输部门的任务是十分繁重的。
    社论说：当前救灾物资运输工作的主要问题是任务大、运输力量不足。解决这个矛盾的主要办法是：运输部门积极调动支援沿淮地区的运输力量，迅速恢复遭到洪水冲坏的公路，增辟运输物资的新线路。航运、公路、铁道等部门应该积极提高车船的周转率，充分运用现代化的和民间的运输工具，力求做到车船衔接，保证物资不在中途耽搁。
    社论还指出，物资供应部门要加强调运工作的计划性，要从整体利益出发，把当前灾区需要的麦种、粮食、煤炭、油盐大量地调运出去，其他物资酌量兼顾。现在还有些物资供应部门片面强调本单位的运输成本，在水运拥挤、陆运闲的时候，拒绝把物资交给陆路运出；有些地区不顾其他地区的需要，还有扣留船只和浪费车辆的现象。这些本位主义的做法都该加以反对。总之，在生产救灾物资的起运、中转和接受地区，应该根据服从灾区需要的原则，动员和运用一切力量，争取早日把物资送到灾区。
