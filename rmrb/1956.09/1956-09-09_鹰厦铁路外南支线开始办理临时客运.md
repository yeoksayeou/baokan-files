    Yingtan-Xiamen Railway Wainan Branch Line Begins Temporary Passenger Transport

    (Our newspaper's dispatch) The Nanping Station, the terminal of the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway's Waiyang-Nanping Branch Line, officially began handling temporary passenger transport on September 1st. That afternoon, the first batch of passengers from both sides of the Minjiang River in Fujian Province, heading to other provinces and various stations along the line, continuously made their way to Nanping Station. The passengers were all delighted to have been able to buy tickets for the first train. Yao Ge, an elderly woman from Quanzhou and a relative of an overseas Chinese, said: "I had wanted to visit my eldest son in the navy for many years, but I never made it because transportation was inconvenient. Now it's great, and I should really thank the railway construction troops." Among the first batch of passengers were government staff members going to other places for procurement, young students going to various colleges and universities to register, farmers from mountainous areas, and officers and soldiers visiting their hometowns during the holidays.

    鹰厦铁路外南支线开始办理临时客运
    本报讯　鹰厦铁路外（洋）南（平）支线终点站南平车站于9月1日开始正式办理临时客运。当天下午，到外省和沿线各站的福建省闽江两岸的首批旅客，络续向南平车站进发。旅客们都为能买到首次列车车票而高兴。来自泉州的一位侨眷姚格老大娘说：“我过去早就想到海军部队看看离家多年的大儿子，因为交通不便，始终没有去成。这一回可好了，真应该感谢修路部队。”在首批旅客中，有到外地采购的政府工作人员和到各地高等学校报到的青年学生，有山区的农民，也有在假期探望家乡的军官和士兵。　　　　　　　　　（铁铭）
