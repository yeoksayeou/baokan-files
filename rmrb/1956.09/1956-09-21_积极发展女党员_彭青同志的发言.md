Actively Develop Female Party Members
Comrade Peng Qing's Speech

I completely agree with Chairman Mao's opening address, and the reports made by Comrades Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, and Deng Xiaoping on behalf of the Central Committee. I would like to offer some opinions on the ideological obstacles encountered in Hebei Province regarding the development of female Party members in rural areas, and how to overcome these obstacles.

Hebei Province currently has more than 192,000 female Party members, accounting for 15 percent of the total number of Party members in the province. They have played their due role in uniting women to complete the tasks of the Party in various periods.

Party organizations at all levels in Hebei Province attach importance to the development of female Party members. In the process of developing female Party members in rural areas, various ideological obstacles have been encountered, the main one being the feudal idea of valuing men over women, the belief that "women are useless," and the failure to attach importance to the development of female Party members. Some revealed many incorrect views when developing female Party members, such as not developing young women because they will marry out; not developing middle-aged women because they have children and working is inconvenient; and not developing elderly women because they are old. As a result, women activists are kept outside the door of the Party. This incorrect thinking is also reflected in the allocation of specific work for female Party members, neglecting their active role in the family, and not taking into account the special needs and difficulties of female Party members. Instead, they regard their actual problems, such as taking care of children and managing household chores, as "nagging," "troublesome," and "backward." Therefore, during Party rectification, some Party organizations persuaded so-called "backward" female Party members to withdraw from the Party or even expelled them. In Ningjin County, a female Party member was expelled because she did not participate in Party rectification studies due to childbirth. This erroneous thinking and method not only dampened the enthusiasm of women activists and female Party members, but also greatly affected the Party organization's connection with the broad masses of women.

In response to the above situation, we first educated Party cadres and all Party members to correctly understand the important role of women in the cause of revolution and construction, and the important significance of absorbing advanced women into the Party for the Party to unite, organize, and mobilize women. In addition, it is also necessary to educate Party members to correctly understand the politically active role of women in the family. Women taking care of children and managing household chores are also a kind of labor. And through summarizing and checking the positive actions and exemplary deeds of women in various aspects at that time and locally, education is carried out.

Secondly, it is necessary to take specific measures with planning, steps, the entire Party acting, and dedicated personnel being responsible. In our work, in addition to promoting grassroots organizations to pay attention to cultivating women activists in various tasks, we also stipulated specific plans for developing female Party members. In the provincial Party committee's plan for developing new Party members from 1956 to 1957, it was required that female Party members account for 30 percent of the total number of new Party members, and it was clearly proposed that the main targets for developing new Party members in rural areas are young people and activists among women. Under this requirement, the county and district Party committees helped the branches make specific plans for developing female Party members based on the actual situation, and at the same time assigned dedicated personnel to be responsible. In this way, the work of developing female Party members has been carried out. According to statistics from forty-three counties in the first half of this year, women account for an average of 20 percent of the newly developed Party members, and some branches have reached more than 30 percent.

It also needs to be pointed out that not only should attention be paid to development, but also frequent ideological education should be carried out for female Party members to improve their awareness and strengthen their Party spirit, so that they can play an exemplary role in work and production labor, as well as in managing household chores. And Party organizations should be educated to pay attention to the specific help and appropriate use of female Party members. In the allocation of some specific tasks, they should not be required to be exactly the same as male Party members. It is necessary to appropriately take into account their special problems such as having children and household burdens. For example, when some female Party members have difficulty coming out to meetings at night, the branch will assign someone to convey the Party's instructions and resolutions to them after the meeting, or go to their homes to hold group meetings; for example, caring for and helping them to improve the relationship between mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law, and between husband and wife, in order to enhance family unity. These will encourage female Party members to work actively.

Although we have paid attention to the work of developing female Party members, it is not enough and needs to be worked hard in future work. To develop female Party members, it is impossible without solving the ideological problems of cadres and without paying attention to the characteristics and difficulties of women. This is my suggestion.

### 积极发展女党员  彭青同志的发言

    积极发展女党员
    彭青同志的发言
    我完全同意毛主席的开幕词，刘少奇同志、周恩来同志、邓小平同志代表中央委员会所作的报告。我仅就河北省关于农村发展女党员时遇到的一些思想阻碍和怎样克服这些思想阻碍的问题发表一点意见。
    河北省现在共有女党员十九万二千多名，占全省党员总数的百分之十五。她们在团结妇女完成党的各个时期的任务中发挥了应有的作用。
    河北省各级党组织对发展女党员是重视的。在农村发展女党员的过程中，曾遇到了各种各样的思想障碍，其中主要的是重男轻女的封建思想，认为“妇女不中用”，不重视发展妇女党员。有的在发展女党员时暴露了许多不正确的观点，比如青年妇女要出嫁，不发展；壮年妇女有娃娃，工作不方便，不发展；老年妇女年纪大，也不发展。这样一来，就把妇女积极分子关在党的大门以外。这种不正确的思想，也反映在分配妇女党员的具体工作的问题上，忽视她们在家庭中的积极作用，不照顾女党员的特殊要求与困难，反而把她们照顾孩子、管理家务等实际问题，视为“啰嗦”“麻烦”和“落后”。因此，在整党时有的党组织便将所谓“落后”的女党员劝她出党，甚至开除党籍。宁津县有一个女党员因生孩子没有参加整党学习，也被开除了。这种错误的思想和办法，不仅挫伤了妇女积极分子和女党员的积极性，而且大大地影响了党组织与广大妇女群众的联系。
    我们针对上述情况，首先是教育党的干部和全体党员正确认识妇女在革命和建设事业中的重要作用，以及吸收先进的妇女入党，对于党团结、组织和发动妇女的重要意义。此外，还要教育党员正确地认识妇女在家庭中所起的政治上的积极作用，妇女照管孩子、料理家务，同样也是一种劳动。并且通过总结和检查当时当地妇女在各方面的积极行动和模范事迹，进行教育。
    其次，是必须采取有计划、有步骤、全党动手、专人负责的具体措施。我们在工作中，除推动基层组织注意在各项工作中培养妇女积极分子，同时也规定了发展妇女党员的具体计划。省委一九五六年至一九五七年的发展新党员计划中，要求女党员占新党员总数的百分之三十，并明确提出了在农村发展新党员的主要对象是青年和妇女中的积极分子。在这个要求下，县、区党委帮助支部根据实际情况作出发展女党员的具体计划，同时确定专人负责。这样一来，发展女党员的工作就有了开展。根据今年上半年四十三个县的统计，新发展的党员中，妇女平均占到百分之二十，有一些支部则达到百分之三十以上。
    还需要提出，不仅仅注意发展，而且还要经常对女党员进行思想教育，提高她们的觉悟，增强党性锻炼，使她们在工作和生产劳动中以及管好家务等方面起模范带头作用。并且要教育党组织注意对女党员的具体帮助和恰当的使用，在一些具体工作的分配上，不应当要求她们完全和男党员一样。必须适当照顾她们有孩子与家务负担等特殊问题。比如有的女党员在晚上出来开会有困难时，会后支部就指定专人向她们传达党的指示、决议，或者到她们家里去开小组会；比如关心和帮助她们搞好婆媳、夫妇之间的关系，以便增进家庭团结。这些都会鼓励女党员积极工作。
    我们虽然注意了发展女党员的工作，但是还不够，有待今后工作中努力。要发展女党员，不解决干部的思想问题，不注意妇女的特点和困难，是办不到的。这就是我的一点建议。
