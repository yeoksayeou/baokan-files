    They Have Confidence to Overcome the Disaster
    ——Visiting Gaoyang County, a Heavily Affected Area in Hebei Province
    By Our Correspondent He Li
    Gaoyang is one of the counties in Hebei Province that has been most severely affected by the disaster. On August 24th, I went to Gaoyang for a visit.
    Originally, there was a motor road from Baoding to Gaoyang, but now cars cannot pass, so I had to take a boat from the Fu River. The Fu River is a small river no more than six or seven zhang wide, which did not originally lead to Gaoyang, but a major flood breached the riverbanks, and the land on both sides became a lake, so boats could go everywhere. From Baoding, sailing down the Fu River directly reaches Gaoyang City. The city is surrounded by temporary dikes, which are covered with reeds and soft materials, blocking the flood outside the dikes.
    I found Comrade Guo Minglin, the county party secretary, in the city and asked about the disaster situation and the people's living conditions. He first told me that under the leadership of the Party and with the help of the state, the general mood of the disaster victims is basically stable. Although the whole county has been generally affected by the disaster, there have been very few deaths or injuries, and most of the livestock have been saved. Then, Comrade Guo Minglin told me about the struggle of the people throughout the county against the flood. He said that Gaoyang is prone to floods due to its low-lying terrain, and the Party and the people have experience in flood prevention and disaster relief. When the great flood came, the county party committee, on the one hand, led the people to protect the Qianli (Thousand-Li) dike of the Zhulong River, and on the other hand, arranged for each village to build dikes around the villages. On the morning of the 7th, the water began to surround the villages. The people of many villages were fighting while raising the dikes as the water rose. The dikes built in Datuan Village in the south of the county were as high as eight chi, and finally withstood the flood. Although 97% of the land in the county was flooded this time, half of the villages did not flood. After emergency rescue, the people and livestock in the flooded villages were preserved. Most of the disaster victims have now returned to their villages.
    We talked about how to survive the famine in the future. The county party secretary said with confidence that most of the people in Gaoyang can weave cloth. There are 8,000 iron looms in the county, which weave wide cloth. The craftsmanship is very high, and Gaoyang cloth has been sold throughout the country. Now, as long as the state supplies cotton yarn, one loom can support four people, and 8,000 looms can support 32,000 people. Together with auxiliary workers such as sizing yarn and winding thread, even more people can be supported. In addition, making vermicelli, opening sugar workshops, knitting socks, making pockets, weaving mats, fishing, twisting ropes, making shoes, burning kilns, ginning cotton, making saltpeter, and engaging in transportation can organize more than 48,000 male and female laborers. By the end of this year, they can earn more than 1.38 million yuan; the county can earn an average of more than seven yuan per person.
    Salvaging the remaining autumn crops can also increase some income. According to the county party committee's calculations, more than 65,000 mu of sorghum were planted in the county this year. Because sorghum is more resistant to waterlogging, it is estimated that each mu can still produce 55 jin. More than 40,000 mu of corn, although mostly soaked and damaged, can still yield 25 jin per mu. Together with millet and a few un-flooded crops, a total of about 5.4 million jin of remaining autumn crops can be harvested. Gaoyang County has a population of 184,000, averaging nearly 30 jin per person, enough for one month's food.
    In view of the fact that Gaoyang's low-lying terrain is subject to disasters year after year, the county party committee is considering reforming the farming system, focusing on promoting wheat, potatoes, and sorghum, and reducing other autumn-ripening crops, so as to avoid the rainy season and reduce losses. In addition, in the southern part of the county, there are also 40,000 to 50,000 mu of higher land that is not easily flooded, where high-yield crops such as corn can be grown. In this way, even if there is rain and flooding throughout the county, at least 50 to 60 million jin of grain can be harvested. Coupled with sideline income, the lives of the general public will not be too difficult. If the weather is good and there is no flood, replanting late autumn crops in the wheat and potato fields can also increase some income.

    Under the leadership of the Party, the disaster victims are full of confidence in production for self-salvation. I went to visit the Xihe Xinghuo Agricultural Production Cooperative in Gaoyang. This cooperative was flooded for five years and drought for two years in the past eight years, and only one year was normal. Now, several villages have been isolated by floods, and people rely on boats to travel to and from each other, but thanks to the collective strength of the agricultural production cooperative and the long-term experience in surviving famine, the masses are very stable.
    When I arrived at the village, the disaster victims were busy winding thread, weaving cloth, and fishing. The cooperative has 102 looms, most of which are concentrated for production, like a textile handicraft factory. I walked into a courtyard, the ground was muddy and difficult to walk on. I followed the base of the wall and stepped on a wooden strip into the machine room. The room was densely packed with iron machines, and the "whirring" of the machines made it difficult to hear each other speak. The ground was very damp, and the feet of the iron machines were padded with bricks more than one chi high. The cooperative cadres told me that the houses were full of water a few days ago. People were eager to engage in sideline production, so they set up the machines from the stagnant water and started working.
    The cooperative plans to engage in sixteen kinds of sideline occupations, and all more than 1,300 laborers in the cooperative can be organized into sideline production. The largest is weaving, which accounts for about half of the labor force. Recently, it has also started to organize 300 women to make cloth socks. All the women in the cooperative have handed over more than 10,000 chi of cloth coupons they have saved to the cooperative. It is estimated that 200 pairs of socks can be made every day, with a labor cost of 25 to 27 fen per pair. It is said that these cloth socks can be sold nearby in Anxin (because many women in Anxin weave mats and need to buy cloth socks) and as far away as Zhangjiakou. According to the cooperative's sideline plan, 503 yuan can be earned every day, and the cooperative can earn an average of 19 fen per person per day. According to the general normal life of the masses here, 15 fen a day is enough to eat and drink. As long as this plan can be realized, the famine can be overcome.
    The cooperative cadres talked to me about the major floods in 1917 (i.e., the sixth year of the Republic of China) and 1939. At that time, corpses floated everywhere in the water and no one salvaged them. Many people who escaped were never heard from again. Those who stayed at home had a really hard time. Not to mention anything else, the rise in prices was terrible. Now, every fen earned counts, and the state transports grain in large quantities. As long as there is labor, there is no problem with life.
    When I talked to the masses, I found that one reason why their emotions were stable was that they felt the assistance of the state, and the other reason was that the cooperative had a plan. Before liberation, when they suffered disasters, the state would not care about them. After liberation, during individual management, although there was state support, everything had to be planned by themselves. Now the state is largely responsible, and the cooperative is largely responsible, so although they are in the midst of disaster, they feel very secure.
    I visited several peasant families separately in Xihe. One was a family with strong labor and a solid foundation. The head of the household was Zhang Jianxiong, with a family of six. Jianxiong is a full laborer and is now raising livestock in the cooperative. His wife is also a strong laborer and plans to join the cooperative to knit socks. His father is in his fifties and plans to go fishing. His family's food can be maintained for the time being. As long as sideline occupations can be developed, the whole family can earn at least more than 20 yuan a month, and there is no big problem with life. Another household is Liu Cun, a 77-year-old widow. The cooperative provides her with food, and the state has recently sent relief funds. There is no big problem with eating. The only difficulties are firewood and water. The more difficult ones are families with many people and little labor. These households account for more than 10% of the total cooperative. I visited Lu Jinsheng's family, which has seven people and one laborer. This year's summer harvest yielded 130 jin of wheat and more than 100 jin of potatoes, which were eaten up long ago. Now they rely on loans and salvaging the remaining autumn crops to survive. The cooperative cadres told me that the district is planning to hold a meeting to study how to help these labor-deficient households overcome the famine.
    Livestock breeding in flooded areas is a serious problem. The disaster victims have shown the spirit of mutual help in times of trouble, which has solved this difficulty. For example, in Xingjia South District, the terrain is high in the south and low in the north. The disaster is more serious in the north, and many livestock are soaked in the water. The district committee proposed to hand over the livestock in the north to the agricultural production cooperatives in the south for foster care, and also sell pigs and sheep to the south. Initially, both the south and the north had different opinions. Some cooperative members in the north said: "Who will take care of livestock that is not their own? It is better to sell it and have cash to spend." Cooperative members in the south were afraid of trouble and worried about not feeding them well and being blamed. In view of these situations, the district committee convened the township and cooperative cadres from the north and south sides to conduct collective mutual assistance education. After negotiations between the north and the south, based on the principle of "mutual assistance and mutual benefit without suffering losses," it was decided that 102 livestock from ten cooperatives in three townships, including Xihe, in the northern part, would be transported to the cooperatives in four townships, including Liuhezhuang, in the southern part for foster care. The method is that severely affected cooperatives can send breeders to lead the livestock (one person with five heads) to lightly affected cooperatives. The feed and changing halters for the livestock are provided by the lightly affected cooperatives. The livestock is used by the lightly affected cooperatives without remuneration. The expenses of the breeders are borne by the severely affected cooperatives. If the livestock has diseases or casualties, the lightly affected cooperatives are responsible for the accidents, and both parties are responsible for non-responsibility accidents (such as infectious diseases). Pigs and sheep are uniformly purchased by the lightly affected cooperatives at fair prices and distributed to cooperative members for feeding. The implementation of this method has been very good, and many cooperative members say that this is a good method.

    他们有信心战胜灾荒
    ——访河北省重灾区高阳县
    本报记者　贺笠
    高阳是河北受灾最严重的县份之一。8月24日，我到高阳去访问。
    从保定到高阳原是有汽车路的，现在汽车已不通行，我只好从府河坐船去。府河是一条宽不过六、七丈的小河，原来并不通高阳，但是一场大水把河堤冲决，两岸土地都变成一片湖泊，船只也就到处通航了。从保定沿府河下驶直达高阳城，城的四周都筑有临时堤埝，埝上满铺着苇席和软料，洪水被阻挡在埝的外面。
    我在城里找到了县委书记郭明麟同志，问到灾情和人民的生活状况。他首先告诉我：在党的领导和国家的援助下，一般灾民的思想情绪基本上是稳定的。全县虽然普遍受灾，但死伤极少，牲畜绝大部分都已得救。接着郭明麟同志向我谈了全县人民和水灾斗争的情况。他说：高阳由于地势低洼，常遭水患，党和人民都有防洪度灾的经验。当这次大水到来的时候，县委一方面领导人民防护潴龙河千里堤，一方面布置各村打围村埝。7日早晨水就开始围村。许多村庄的人民都是在水涨埝高的情况下战斗着。县南的大团村所筑堤埝高达八尺，终于抵住了洪水。这次全县虽然有97％的土地被淹，但有一半村庄都没有进水。被淹村庄经紧急抢救，人畜都得以保全。现在大部灾民都已回村。
    我们谈起今后如何度荒的问题。这位县委书记很有信心地说：高阳人民大多数都会织布，全县有八千台铁机，织的都是宽面布，手艺很高，高阳布曾行销全国。现在只要国家供给棉纱，一张机光织布就可以养活四口人，八千台机子可养活三万二千人；连同辅助工如浆纱、络线等，养活的人更多。此外，做粉条、开糖房、织袜子、打口袋、编席、打鱼、扭绳、做鞋、烧窑、轧花、制火硝、搞运输等，光这就可以组织男女劳动力四万八千多人。到今年年底，可以收入一百三十八万多元；全县平均每人可得钱七元多。
    打捞残秋，也可以增加些收入。据县委计算，全县今年种高粱六万五千多亩；因高粱比较耐涝，估计今年每亩还可产五十五斤。四万多亩玉米，虽然大部泡坏，每亩还可捞出二十五斤。加上谷子和少数未涝的作物，总共还可收残秋约五百四十万斤。高阳全县十八万四千人口，每人平均近三十斤，够一个月的吃食。
    根据高阳地势低洼连年遭灾的情况，县委正在考虑从耕作制度上加以改革，着重推广小麦、土豆和高粱，减少其他秋熟作物，这样就可以避开雨季，减少损失。另外，在县的南境还有四、五万亩较高的地，不容易受淹，可以种玉米等高产作物。这样，全县即使雨涝，至少也可以收入五、六千万斤粮食。加上副业收入，一般人民生活不致发生多大困难。如果年景好不遭水灾，麦地和土豆地复种的晚秋，还可增加些收入。
            ×　×　×
    在党的领导下，灾民们对生产自救充满信心。我曾到高阳西河星火农业生产合作社去访问，这个社八年中涝了五年，旱了两年，只有一年是正常年景，现在，几个村庄都被洪水隔离，人们往来都靠船只，但是由于农业生产合作社的集体力量，大家又有长期度荒的经验，群众情绪都很稳定。
    我到村子的时候，灾民们正忙着络线、织布、打鱼，全社有一百零二台织布机，大部集中起来生产，好像一座纺织手工业工场。我走到一座院落里，满地泥泞，难以下脚；我顺着墙根踏着一根木条走进机房，房里密密摆着铁机，“哗哗”的机声使对面说话也难以听清楚。地下的土非常潮湿，铁机的脚下都垫上一尺多高的砖。社干部告诉我：前几天屋里都积满了水，人们急着搞副业生产，就把机子从积水中搭起来干。
    这个社共计划搞十六种副业，全社一千三百多个劳动力都可组织在副业生产中。其中最大的一宗是织布，约占劳动力的一半。最近又开始组织三百个妇女做布袜子。全社妇女把自己节约出来的一万多尺布票全都交给合作社，预计每天可以做袜二百双，每双工价二角五分至二角七分。据说这种布袜近可以销安新（因安新妇女多以织席为业，要买布袜），远可以销张家口，按照社里的副业计划，每天可赚五百零三元，全社每人每天平均收入一角九分。按照这里群众一般正常生活，一天一角五分钱已够吃喝。只要这个计划能够实现，就可以度过灾荒。
    社干部和我谈起1917年（即民国六年）和1939年两次大水灾的情况。那时候水里到处飘浮着尸首无人打捞；许多逃出去的人永远没有消息；留在家里的，日子也真难过。不说别的，就是物价上涨就不得了。现在挣一个是一个，国家把粮食大批运来，只要劳动，生活就没有问题。
    我和群众谈话的时候，发觉他们情绪之所以稳定，一个原因就是他们感到有国家的援助，另一个原因是合作社有计划。在解放以前他们遭了灾难，国家是不会过问的；解放后，在个体经营的时候，虽有国家支持，一切也要自己去打算。现在是大有国家负责，小有合作社负责，所以他们虽然处于灾患之中，心里却非常安稳。
    我在西河分别访问了几个农民家庭，一个是劳力较强底力较厚的人家。户主叫张建雄，全家六口人；建雄是一个全劳动力，现在社里饲养牲口；妻子的劳动力也很强，打算参加社里织袜子；父亲五十多岁，打算去捕鱼。现在他家里粮食暂时还可维持；只要副业能展开，全家每月至少可以收入二十多元，生活没大问题。另一户是七十七岁的孤老婆刘存，社里供给她粮食，最近国家又发来救济款，吃的没大问题。只是烧柴用水有点困难。比较困难的是人口多劳力少的人家。这类户在全社要占10％以上。我去访问过吕金声家，这家七口人，一个劳动力，今年夏收分了一百三十斤麦子、一百多斤土豆，早就吃光了，现在靠贷款和打捞残秋过活。社干部告诉我，区里最近正计划开会研究如何帮助这种缺劳力的人家度荒。
    积水地区的牲口饲养是一个严重的问题。灾民们发挥了患难互助的精神，使这个困难得到了解决。如邢家南区，地势南高北低，北边灾重，许多牲畜都泡在水里。区委提出把北边的牲口交南边农业生产合作社寄养，猪羊也卖到南边。最初，南边和北边都有不同意见。北边有些社员说：“不是自己的牲口，谁会拿它当事呢？不如卖掉，得现钱使着也方便。”南边社的社员却怕麻烦，怕喂不好落埋怨。区委根据这些情况，便把南北两方的乡、社干部召集在一起，进行集体互助教育。经过南北协议，本着“互助互济互不吃亏”的原则，决定：把北部西河等三个乡十个社的一百零二头牲口，运到南部六合庄等四个乡各社寄养。办法是重灾社可以派饲养员牵上牲口（一人带五头）到轻灾社，牲口饲料和换笼头等由轻灾社供给，牲口由轻灾社使用，不给报酬，饲养员的费用由重灾社自己负担。如果牲口有疾病或伤亡，责任事故由轻灾社负责，非责任事故（如传染病等）双方负责。猪、羊由轻灾社按公平价格统一收购，分给社员喂养。这办法实行结果很好，很多社员都说这是好办法。
