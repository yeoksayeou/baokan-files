Xinhua News Agency, September 29th. Marshal Peng Dehuai, Vice Premier of the State Council and Minister of National Defense of the People's Republic of China, hosted a banquet at noon today to welcome the Indian Military Goodwill Delegation to China, headed by Lieutenant General J.N. Chaudhuri.

    Indian Ambassador to China, R.K. Nehru, Military Attaché Brigadier Malik, and military attachés from various countries stationed in China were also invited to the banquet.

    Marshal Peng Dehuai delivered a speech at the banquet, extending a warm welcome on behalf of the Chinese People's Liberation Army to all members of the delegation visiting our country. He said that China and India have historically been friendly and share a deep friendship. Both countries have suffered from long-term oppression and exploitation by imperialism. Now that both countries are independent, the armies of both countries bear the glorious task of safeguarding national independence and peaceful construction, and safeguarding peace in Asia and the world. Therefore, the armies of the two countries need to understand, learn from, and help each other. He went on to say that the friendly cooperation between China and India not only helps to enhance the prosperity of both countries, but is also a tremendous force for preventing war and safeguarding peace. He firmly believes that each visit by the delegation will further strengthen the friendship and ties between the peoples and armies of the two countries.

    Lieutenant General J.N. Chaudhuri then spoke, saying that the traditional friendship between the peoples of China and India in history was once hindered by the intrusion of colonialists. Now that this artificial obstacle has been removed, the historical friendship between the two peoples has been restored and developed. He also said that the armies of China and India share the same tasks and need to help each other and exchange experiences even more.

    At the banquet, the guests repeatedly toasted to the health of the leaders of both countries, to the friendship between the peoples and armies of the two countries, and to the common cause of peace.

    Accompanying Marshal Peng Dehuai at the banquet were senior generals of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, including General Chen Geng, General Wang Shusheng, Naval General Xiao Jingguang, General Xu Guangda, Senior General Li Da, Senior General Li Kenong, Senior General Gan Siqi, Air Force Senior General Liu Yalou, Senior General Chen Shiju, Senior General Yang Chengwu, and Lieutenant General Xiao Xiangrong, among others.

    Before the banquet, Marshal Peng Dehuai and Marshal He Long received all members of the Indian Military Goodwill Delegation to China.
