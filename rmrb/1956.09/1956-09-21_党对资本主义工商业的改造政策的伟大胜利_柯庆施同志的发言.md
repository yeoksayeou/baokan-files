I completely agree with the reports of Comrades Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, and Deng Xiaoping.

The Political Report of the Central Committee comprehensively summarizes the rich historical experiences of the revolution since the Seventh National Congress, including the important experiences of correctly handling relations with the national bourgeoisie and victoriously carrying out the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce.

The transformation of capitalist industry and commerce is a complex process of class struggle and ideological struggle.

Shanghai is the center of capitalist industry and commerce in our country. After liberation, the total capital and industrial output value of capitalist industry and commerce in Shanghai still accounted for half of the country's private industry and commerce. In January of this year, driven by the upsurge of the socialist revolution across the country and on the basis of seven years of work, all 203 industries and 84,331 capitalist industrial and commercial enterprises in Shanghai realized joint state-private ownership.

The great victory of the Party in realizing the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce eloquently proves the correctness of our Party's line and policy. However, taking the path of peace and using education and persuasion to change capitalist ownership and transform bourgeois elements is, after all, an unprecedented event. Shanghai's experience proves that the transformation process of capitalist industry and commerce over the past seven years has been a complex process of class struggle, a process of struggle against various "left" and right-leaning thoughts, and also a huge practical process of Marxist-Leninist education. For the complete victory of the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce, systematically summarizing the experiences of the past seven years and profoundly elucidating the correctness of the Party's peaceful transformation policy to overcome various erroneous ideological tendencies remains a huge task facing the Shanghai Party organization. The comprehensive and profound analysis of the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce in the Political Report of the Party Central Committee has played a great educational role for us.

The reason why our Party's policy of peacefully transforming the bourgeoisie has achieved victory, and the reason why the national bourgeoisie can accept socialist transformation, is not determined by anyone's subjective wishes. The dual nature of China's national bourgeoisie, the long-term united front relationship established between the Chinese working class and the national bourgeoisie, the enormous role played by the increasing consolidation of the people's democratic dictatorship and the growing strength of the socialist economy, and the implementation of the Party's correct policy of redemption and the steps of state capitalism—all of this has formed a general trend that promotes the national bourgeoisie to accept peaceful transformation. Only by deeply understanding the role and influence of the above aspects can we obtain the correct answer to why China's national bourgeoisie was finally willing to accept socialist transformation.

It is necessary to see both the negative side of the national bourgeoisie and to utilize their positive side.

The Chinese national bourgeoisie, which grew up on the semi-colonial and semi-feudal social foundation, not only had a dual nature during the democratic revolution, but also exists with a dual nature during the socialist revolution. On the eve of liberation, Shanghai capitalists were both afraid of communism and hoped for national independence, and the Party's policy of protecting private industry and commerce had a huge impact on them. Therefore, some people who had prepared to leave several times finally stayed, and some who had already left later returned. After liberation, they both harbored a strong desire to develop capitalism and did not approve of socialism, and expressed satisfaction with the rapid recovery and development of industry and commerce and the increasing strength of the motherland. Based on the dual nature of the national bourgeoisie and the needs of China's socio-economic transition period, our Party, on the basis of the worker-peasant alliance, formed a policy of political and economic alliance with the national bourgeoisie, formulated a policy of utilizing, restricting, and transforming capitalist industry and commerce, and gradually realized this policy through both unity and struggle with them.

From the socialist transformation work in Shanghai, we felt that it would be wrong to only see the negative side of the national bourgeoisie without utilizing their positive side. Facts have proved that for the past seven years, the Shanghai national bourgeoisie has participated in various anti-imperialist patriotic movements, such as donating airplanes and artillery during the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, opposing US imperialist aggression, supporting land reform and the struggle to liberate Taiwan, and supporting the Common Program and the Constitution, and has done some politically beneficial things for the country. In terms of economy, Shanghai's private industry and commerce has played a positive role in supporting national construction and meeting the needs of the people in increasing production, assisting the state in ensuring supplies, accumulating funds, maintaining employment, and training technicians and engineering technical personnel for the state. By the end of last year, the annual total output value of Shanghai's private industry had increased from more than 2.6 billion yuan in the early days of liberation to nearly 5.7 billion yuan, maintaining the jobs of nearly 600,000 employees. However, it would also be wrong to only see their positive role without seeing their negative role. The speculative and blind nature of the capitalist economy and the behavior of many capitalists seeking exorbitant profits by any means have seriously harmed the lives of workers and the people and national construction. Over the past seven years, the Shanghai Party organization has waged fierce struggles to restrict the destructive role of the capitalist economy. The anti-speculation struggle from the second half of 1949 to 1950 crushed the price surge stirred up three times by speculators, which was conducive to the state controlling the main raw material market and stabilizing prices. The Three-Anti and Five-Anti movements in 1952 severely cracked down on the bourgeoisie's five evil behaviors, repelled the bourgeoisie's rampant offensive, improved the class consciousness of party cadres, and realized the working class's supervision of private enterprises. Without resolutely carrying out this struggle, we would not have been able to achieve today's victory in the socialist transformation of capitalism.

However, our restriction on capitalist industry and commerce is for the better utilization and transformation of them; our struggle against the bourgeoisie is for uniting and educating them. Therefore, every struggle is also a process of unity and education, so that capitalists can gain useful lessons in the face of facts. Many bourgeois elements have gradually made progress and gradually approached our Party and the People's Government in these struggles. Our struggle has also grasped strict boundaries, only fighting against aspects that violate state laws and regulations and are detrimental to the national economy and people's livelihood, while preventing random struggles and striving to avoid stagnation of production and legitimate business operations. When they encounter difficulties, we also take care of their difficulties, such as providing necessary assistance in terms of raw materials, loans, and markets, and sometimes making reasonable concessions to facilitate the positive role of private industry and commerce. The result of this is that it creates favorable conditions for the national bourgeoisie to gradually accept socialist transformation. In the past seven years of Shanghai's transformation work, there have been some shortcomings and errors. The emergence of these shortcomings and errors, from the root, is due to the lack of deep understanding of the dual nature of the national bourgeoisie and the failure to correctly grasp the Party's policy of utilizing, restricting, uniting, and struggling.

The influence of various practical educations has powerfully promoted the bourgeoisie to accept transformation.

Since liberation, there has been a competition between the two economies, socialist and capitalist. In this competition, the growth of the socialist economy and its increasingly significant superiority have finally made the capitalist economy lose. The sharp contrast between the infinite vitality of the socialist economy and the backwardness of the capitalist economy is vividly placed before the people and also before the capitalists. Among the capitalists in Shanghai, some once predicted that the Communist Party only understands military affairs and politics and does not understand production. What was the result? The product quality, cost, labor productivity, and the material and cultural welfare of employees in state-owned factories generally exceeded those of capitalist enterprises to varying degrees. This comparison of advantages and disadvantages is also prominent in factories that have been transformed into various forms of state capitalism and purely private factories: the same private factory is one way before processing orders, and another way after processing orders; one way before joint state-private ownership, and another way after joint state-private ownership. Especially with the development of large-scale, planned national construction, the socialist economy is becoming stronger and stronger, and the proportion of the capitalist economy in the national economy is becoming weaker and weaker, all of which makes it impossible for their production and operation to continue as before.

Moreover, along with the development of socialist construction and socialist transformation, the entire Chinese society has also undergone profound changes. For example, on the same street, state-owned shops are crowded with customers, while private shops are deserted. Many similar facts, coupled with the long-term and repeated political education conducted by our Party and the People's Government, cannot but have an impact on the bourgeois elements, and cannot but cause a profound differentiation within the bourgeoisie and within their families. A group of activists willing to accept transformation has emerged among the bourgeoisie, and has gradually inclined the middle and backward elements among them to accept transformation. Many capitalists' children refuse to accept property inheritance rights, and even some capitalists' family members, after years of education, agree with and persuade their husbands to accept transformation. They said: The People's Government and the Communist Party have educated their husbands well and harmonized their families. They said: Taking the old road of capitalism has only two futures: making a fortune means marrying a concubine, which is bound to lead to family breakdown; failure means jumping into the Huangpu River, causing a tragic end. Although the bourgeois elements subjectively do not like socialism, they cannot but powerfully promote them to accept transformation due to the influence of these practical educations.

The policy of gradual transformation and gradual redemption has achieved positive results in practical work.

Of course, the reason why the bourgeoisie can accept socialist transformation is also due to our Party's correct adoption of the policy of gradual transformation and gradual redemption. The gradual transformation policy adopted by our Party is: the first step is to transform capitalism into state capitalism, and the second step is to transform state capitalism into socialism. In implementing the first step, we are gradually transforming from the lower forms of state capitalism to the higher forms of state capitalism. Gradual transformation and gradual redemption are related. Before the joint operation of the entire industry, the method of redemption is to allow them to obtain a certain profit; after the joint operation of the entire industry, they are paid a certain dividend within a certain period, and their work and life are reasonably arranged. Such redemption is not only necessary, but also most beneficial to the working class.

From 1950 to 1955, the capitalists in Shanghai received approximately 400 million yuan in net profit (excluding taxes and investments), plus dividends of approximately 60 to 70 million yuan per year in the coming years. This price is certainly not small. But it will be exchanged for the elimination of capitalist ownership; it enables us to avoid destruction, completely take over capitalist enterprises, and fully utilize the role of these enterprises in meeting the needs of the people and the country. Our redemption policy is also a policy of transforming and educating bourgeois elements and giving them a way out. Therefore, it not only stabilizes the people's hearts of the bourgeois elements and encourages the enthusiasm of the bourgeois elements to accept socialist transformation, but also greatly facilitates stabilizing the various strata of people affected by the bourgeoisie, so as to give full play to their technology and talents and mobilize their enthusiasm to participate in the construction of socialism.

The upsurge of the joint operation of the entire industry of capitalist industry and commerce appeared under the mutual promotion of the great role played by the Party's socialist transformation policy of capitalist industry and commerce in the above aspects, especially after the upsurge of agricultural cooperation across the country, under the leading promotion of activists among the bourgeoisie. As everyone knows, this upsurge arrived in a joyful atmosphere of gongs and drums, firecrackers, and Yangko dances. This great victory of the working class is a huge victory of the creative application of Marxism-Leninism by the Party Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong.

Strengthen the Party's ideological leadership and continue to carry out the struggle against "left" and right-leaning thoughts.

The Shanghai Party organization has received profound education and training in the work of implementing the Party's peaceful transformation policy under the direct leadership of the Central Committee over the past few years. However, our task has not been finally completed. After the joint operation of the old capitalist enterprises, there are still many tasks to be carried out, such as enterprise reorganization, technological transformation, and further transformation into nationalization. And the work of transforming bourgeois elements has developed to a new stage. Due to the changes in production relations, capitalists have become staff members of state-owned enterprises and joint enterprises. The relationship between Party members, cadres, and employees in these enterprises and bourgeois elements is in a complex situation of both working together and class relations. Due to the victory of the joint operation of the entire industry, some of our cadres have developed the idea that everything is going well, forgetting the long-term and arduous nature of transforming bourgeois elements. Among more people, the long-standing "left" sentiment is still playing a role. Some bourgeois elements also have a one-sided view that since the entire industry has been jointly operated, there is no need for further transformation. In order to win the victory of transforming bourgeois elements, the Party must greatly strengthen ideological work and continue to carry out the struggle against all "left" and right-leaning thoughts that violate the Party's policy. Some people say that peaceful transformation is not class struggle. They do not understand that in a country led by the working class, all utilization, restriction, and transformation of the capitalist economy and various forms of education for capitalists are actually another manifestation of class struggle, because the purpose of peaceful transformation is to eliminate the bourgeoisie. Therefore, the victory of peaceful transformation is precisely the victory of the working class in class struggle. Some people say that the bourgeoisie's acceptance of transformation with gongs and drums is a scam and that they should be careful not to be fooled. They have not thought that when capitalists hand over all the management rights, property disposal rights, and personnel allocation rights of the enterprise to the state-owned professional company, what exactly have they defrauded? Others say that capitalists can only exploit and have no role, and there is no need to carry this burden. They do not understand that the bourgeoisie is still a relatively cultured class in China today. Many of the hundreds of thousands of capitalists in Shanghai have rich business knowledge and management talents, and seven or eight thousand of them have high levels of production technology. Transforming these people to serve socialism is a wealth of the country, not a burden. Still others say that capitalists cannot be transformed into self-reliant laborers. They should know that after capitalist ownership is eliminated, capitalists have no possibility or conditions to exploit, and they also have the ability to work. We will also make proper arrangements, and even for those who lack skills, we will educate and train them to acquire work ability. Therefore, saying that they cannot be transformed into self-reliant laborers is also not in line with reality. Some people also say that after the joint operation of the entire industry, bourgeois elements no longer have negativity and only have socialist enthusiasm. This argument is also incorrect. After the joint state-private ownership and fixed interest rates of the entire industry, the enthusiasm of most people in the bourgeoisie has increased, but because they have not completely broken away from the status of exploiters, capitalist ideology and work style will still exist for a long time, which is their negative side and needs to be transformed through long-term education.

In order to further transform bourgeois elements, the Party must carry out huge educational work, so that the vast number of cadres and workers can understand how to distinguish between correct and wrong views, and recognize the consistency between giving play to the positive role of capitalists and helping them carry out ideological transformation, reasonably arrange their work, attract them to participate in socialist competition, support them in making achievements, organize them to participate in political studies, and care about their lives. They should be encouraged when they do the right things, and their shortcomings or mistakes should be patiently educated and helped to correct. All their useful knowledge and experience should be humbly learned from them. At the same time, workers should be educated to understand that the powers of capitalists in enterprises today are what they should have as ordinary state workers, not the powers they acquired in the past by relying on capital. Therefore, they must have a good working relationship with them. For the contradictions that still exist between them and the working class, we must be good at using the methods of education and persuasion, and the method of criticism and self-criticism, to help bourgeois elements carry out ideological transformation and gradually overcome them. We believe that the Shanghai Party organization, in completing the future task of dual transformation of the bourgeoisie, will surely achieve a complete victory as long as it unswervingly advances along the path pointed out by the Party Central Committee.

### 党对资本主义工商业的改造政策的伟大胜利  柯庆施同志的发言

    党对资本主义工商业的改造政策的伟大胜利
    柯庆施同志的发言
    我完全同意刘少奇同志、周恩来同志和邓小平同志的报告。
    中央委员会的政治报告，全面地总结了七次代表大会以来丰富的革命历史经验，其中包括了正确地处理同民族资产阶级的关系和胜利地进行资本主义工商业社会主义改造的重要经验。
    对资本主义工商业的改造过程，是一个复杂的阶级斗争和思想斗争的过程
    上海是我国资本主义工商业的中心。解放以后，上海资本主义工商业的资本总额和工业总产值仍占全国私营工商业的一半。今年一月，在全国社会主义革命高潮的推动下，在过去七年工作的基础上，上海全市二百零三个行业，八万四千三百三十一户资本主义工商业，全部实现了公私合营。
    党对资本主义工商业实现社会主义改造的伟大胜利，雄辩地证明了我们党的路线、政策的正确性。但是，采取和平的道路，运用教育说服的方法来变革资本主义所有制和改造资产阶级分子，毕竟是一件史无前例的事情。上海的经验证明：七年来对资本主义工商业的改造过程，是一个复杂的阶级斗争过程，是同各种“左”右倾思想的斗争过程，也是一个巨大的实际的马克思列宁主义的教育过程。为了私营工商业的社会主义改造的彻底胜利，系统地总结七年来的经验，深刻地阐明党的和平改造政策的正确性，以克服各种错误的思想倾向，仍然是摆在上海党组织面前的巨大任务。党中央委员会政治报告中对资本主义工商业实行社会主义改造的全面、深刻的分析，对我们起了极大的教育作用。
    我们党的和平改造资产阶级的政策所以取得胜利，民族资产阶级的所以可能接受社会主义改造，并不决定于任何人的主观愿望。中国民族资产阶级的两重性特点，中国工人阶级同民族资产阶级建立了长期的统一战线关系，人民民主专政政权的日益巩固与社会主义经济的日益壮大所发生的巨大作用，党的正确的赎买政策和国家资本主义步骤的贯彻执行，这一切就形成了一个推动民族资产阶级接受和平改造的总趋势。对于我国民族资产阶级之所以最后愿意接受社会主义改造，只有深刻地理解上述几个方面所起的作用和影响，才能得到正确的解答。
    既要看到民族资产阶级消极的一面，也要利用他们的积极的一面在半殖民地、半封建的社会基础上成长起来的中国民族资产阶级，不仅在民主革命时期有两重性的特点，在社会主义革命时期仍然存在着两重性的特点。解放前夕，上海的资本家一面害怕共产，一面又希望国家的独立，而党的保护私营工商业政策又对他们起了巨大的影响，因此，一些几度准备出走的人，最后还是留下来了，有些已经出走的人，后来还是回来了。解放以后，他们一面怀着发展资本主义的强烈愿望，并不赞成社会主义，一面对工商业的迅速恢复和发展与祖国的日益强盛又表示满意。我们党中央正是根据对于民族资产阶级这种两重性的特点和我国过渡时期社会经济的需要，在工农联盟的基础上，同民族资产阶级结成了政治上、经济上联盟的政策，制定了对资本主义工商业的利用、限制、改造的政策，经过对他们又团结又斗争，逐步地实现了这个政策。
    从上海的社会主义改造工作中，我们感觉到，如果只看到民族资产阶级消极的一面而不去利用他们积极的一面，那是错误的。事实证明：七年来，上海民族资产阶级参加了各项反帝爱国运动，如在抗美援朝时捐献飞机大炮，反对美帝国主义侵略，支持土地改革和解放台湾的斗争，拥护共同纲领和宪法，做了一些政治上有利于国家的事情。在经济上，上海私营工商业在增加生产、协助国家保证供应、积累资金、维持就业、为国家培养技工和工程技术人才等方面，发挥了支援国家建设和满足人民需要的积极作用。截至去年年底止，上海私营工业的每年生产总值已从解放初期的二十六亿多元，增加到近五十七亿元；维持了近六十万职工的工作。但是，如果只看到他们的积极作用，没有看到他们的消极作用，也是错误的。资本主义经济的投机性和盲目性，很多资本家不择手段地追求暴利的行为，都曾经严重地损害了工人和人民的生活和国家建设。七年来，上海党组织为了限制资本主义经济的破坏作用，曾经进行过激烈的斗争。一九四九年下半年到一九五○年进行反投机的斗争，打垮了投机商人三次掀起的物价大涨风，有利于国家控制主要原料市场，稳定了物价。一九五二年进行的三反五反斗争，严重地打击了资产阶级的五毒行为，击退了资产阶级的猖狂进攻，提高了党员干部的阶级觉悟，实现了工人阶级对私营企业的监督。如果没有坚决进行这种斗争，我们就不可能取得今天对资本主义进行社会主义改造的胜利。
    但是我们对资本主义工商业的限制，是为了更好地利用和改造它们；我们对资产阶级的斗争，是为了团结和教育他们。所以每一次斗争的过程，同时也总是团结和教育的过程，使资本家在事实面前，获得有益的教训，许多资产阶级分子就是在这些斗争中，逐渐得到进步，逐步靠拢我们党和人民政府的。我们的斗争又掌握了严格的界限，只斗那些违背国家法令和不利于国计民生的方面，同时防止乱斗，极力避免生产和正当经营的停顿；在他们遇到困难的时候，又照顾他们的困难，如在原料、贷款、市场等方面，我们主动加以必要的帮助，有时并作出合理的让步，以利于发挥私营工商业正当的积极的作用。这样做的结果，就为民族资产阶级逐步接受社会主义改造创造了有利的条件。七年来上海改造的工作中，曾有过一些缺点和错误。这种缺点和错误的产生，从根源来说，都是由于对民族资产阶级两重性缺乏深刻的认识和对党的利用和限制又团结又斗争的政策，没有正确掌握的缘故。
    各种实际教育的影响，有力地推动了资产阶级接受改造
    从解放以来存在了社会主义和资本主义两种经济的比赛。在这种比赛中，社会主义经济的壮大和它的越来越显著的优越性，使资本主义经济终于比输下去了。社会主义经济的无限生命力和资本主义经济的落后的鲜明对比，生动地摆在人民的面前，也摆在资本家的面前。上海的资本家中，曾经有人预言过共产党只懂军事、政治，不懂生产。结果如何呢？国营工厂的产品质量、成本和劳动生产率以及职工的物质文化福利，无论那一方面，一般地都在不同程度上超过了资本主义企业。这种优劣的对比就是在转变为各种国家资本主义形式的工厂和纯粹私营的工厂中也显得突出：同样一个私营工厂，加工订货以前是一个样子，加工订货以后又是一个样子；公私合营以前是一个样子，合营以后又是一个样子。特别是随着国家大规模、有计划建设的发展，社会主义经济越来越强大，资本主义经济在国民经济中的比重越来越削弱，这一切，就使得他们的生产经营已经不可能照老样子维持下去了。
    而且，跟着社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的发展，整个中国社会也起了深刻的变化。例如在同一条街上，国营商店顾客拥挤，私营商店则是冷冷清清。类似这类的许多事实，加以我们党和人民政府对他们长期反复进行的政治教育，不能不在资产阶级分子中发生影响，不能不在资产阶级内部和他们的家庭中间也引起了深刻的分化，资产阶级中出现了一批愿意接受改造的积极分子，并使他们中间的中间分子和落后分子，逐步地倾向接受改造。许多资本家的子女，拒绝接受财产继承权，连一些资本家的家属也在受到多年教育以后，赞成和规劝丈夫接受改造。她们说：人民政府和共产党教育好了她们的丈夫，和睦了他们的家庭。她们说：走资本主义的老路，只有两个前途，发了财是娶小老婆，势必弄得家庭破裂；失败了就只有跳黄浦江，造成悲惨的结局。资产阶级分子主观上尽管不喜欢社会主义，但是，由于这些实际的教育的影响，不能不有力地推动他们走向接受改造。
    逐步改造和逐步赎买的政策，在实际工作中收到了积极的效果
    当然，资产阶级的所以可能接受社会主义改造，还由于我们党正确地采取了逐步改造和逐步赎买的政策。我们党所采取的逐步改造政策就是：第一步是把资本主义转变为国家资本主义，第二步是把国家资本主义转变为社会主义。在实行第一个步骤中，又是从低级形式的国家资本主义逐步转变为高级形式的国家资本主义。逐步改造和逐步赎买是相联系的，在全行业合营以前，赎买的方式是允许他们取得一定的利润；在全行业合营以后，则是在一定时期内支付给他们一定的股息，并且合理地安排他们的工作和生活。这样的赎买，不仅仅是必要的，而且对工人阶级也是最为有利的。
    从一九五零年到一九五五年，上海的资本家大约得到了四亿元的纯利（除纳税投资外），再加上今后几年内每年约计六、七千万元的股息。这笔代价当然是不小的。可是它将换得资本家所有制的消灭；它使我们能够避免破坏，完整地接收了资本主义企业，而又充分利用了这些企业在满足人民和国家需要上的作用。我们的赎买政策，同时也是改造教育民族资产阶级分子并给以出路的政策，因此，它不仅稳定了资产阶级分子的人心，鼓励了资产阶级分子接受社会主义改造的积极性，而且大大有利于安定其它受资产阶级影响的各阶层人民，以利于充分发挥他们的技术和才能，调动他们参加建设社会主义的积极性。
    党对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造政策，在上述各个方面所起的巨大作用的相互推动下，特别是当全国农业合作化高潮出现以后，在资产阶级中的积极分子的带头推动之下，资本主义工商业全行业合营的高潮出现了。大家都知道，这个高潮是在敲锣打鼓、放鞭炮、扭秧歌的欢乐气氛中到来的。工人阶级的这个伟大胜利是以毛泽东同志为首的党中央创造性地运用马克思列宁主义的巨大胜利。
    加强党的思想领导，继续进行反对“左”右倾思想的斗争
    上海党的组织，几年来，在中央直接领导之下，在贯彻执行党的和平改造政策的工作中，得到了深刻的教育和锻炼。但是，我们的任务并没有最后完成，资本主义旧企业在合营以后，还须进行企业改组和技术改革和进一步转变为国有化等许多工作。而改造资产阶级分子的工作又发展到一个新的阶段。由于生产关系的变化，资本家已成为国营企业和合营企业的工作人员，这些企业中的党员干部和职工同资产阶级分子的关系，处于既是共事关系，又是阶级关系的复杂情况之中。由于全行业合营的胜利，在我们的一部分干部中产生了万事大吉的想法，忘记了改造资产阶级分子的长期性和艰苦性。在更多一些人中间，长期存在的“左”的情绪，仍然在起着作用。在一部分资产阶级分子中也存在着以为全行业已经合营，今后再无须进行改造了的片面看法。为了取得改造资产阶级分子的胜利，党必须大大加强思想工作，继续开展与一切违反党的政策的“左”右倾思想的斗争。有人说：和平改造不是阶级斗争，他们不了解在工人阶级领导的国家，一切对资本主义经济的利用、限制、改造和对资本家各种形式的教育，实际上都是阶级斗争的另一种表现形式，因为和平改造的目的是为了消灭资产阶级，所以，和平改造的胜利，正是工人阶级在阶级斗争中的胜利。有人说：资产阶级敲锣打鼓接受改造是一个骗局，要小心上当。他们没有想到：当资本家把企业的经营管理权、财产处理权、和人事调配权全部交给国营专业公司的时候，他们究竟骗得了什么？还有人说：资本家只会剥削，没有任何作用，背这个包袱没有必要。他们不懂得：资产阶级还是今天中国较有文化的阶级，上海十几万资本家中很多人有丰富的业务知识和经营才能，其中有七、八千人具有较高的生产技术水平，把这些人改造过来为社会主义服务，是国家的一笔财富，并不是什么包袱。又有人说：资本家不可能改造成为自食其力的劳动者。他们应该知道：资本主义所有制被消灭以后，资本家已没有可能、没有条件进行剥削，而他们也有工作的能力，我们又加以妥善的安排，就是对于尚缺乏技能的人，我们也加以教育培养，使他们获得工作能力；因此，说他们不能改造成为自食其力的劳动者也是不符合实际的。也有人说：全行业合营以后，资产阶级分子已经没有消极性，只有社会主义的积极性了，这种论调也是不对的。在全行业公私合营和定息以后，资产阶级中的大多数人的积极性是增加了，但是由于他们还没有完全脱离剥削者的地位，资本主义的思想意识和工作作风也还会长期存在，这就是他们的消极的一面，需要经过长期的教育，才能得到改造。
    为了进一步对资产阶级分子进行改造，党必须进行巨大的教育工作，使广大干部和工人群众懂得辨别正确的看法和错误的看法，并且认识发挥资本家的积极作用和帮助他们进行思想改造的一致性，合理地安排他们的工作，吸引他们参加社会主义竞赛，支持他们做出成绩，组织他们参加政治学习，关心他们的生活。他们做得对的，要加以鼓励，他们的缺点或错误，要耐心地教育帮助纠正，他们一切有用的知识和经验，应当虚心向他们学习。同时要教育工人群众懂得：资本家今天在企业中的职权，是他们作为普通的国家工作人员所应该有的，并不是过去那种依靠资本所取得的权力，所以，必须同他们搞好共事关系。对于他们同工人阶级之间还存在着的矛盾，我们要善于用教育说服的方法，批评自我批评的方法，帮助资产阶级分子进行思想改造，逐步地加以克服。我们相信，上海党的组织，在完成今后对资产阶级的双重改造的任务中，只要坚持不懈地按照党中央所指引的道路前进，我们一定会取得彻底的胜利。
