Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 11th—Thirty-three state-owned and jointly state-private heavy industrial factories in Shanghai have now reached the 1957 production value level ahead of schedule. These factories account for about two-thirds of the total number of state-owned and jointly state-private heavy industrial factories in Shanghai with Five-Year Plan targets.

These thirty-three factories are the main factories in Shanghai that manufacture important products such as steam turbines, machine tools, diesel engines, boilers, ships, wires, batteries, switches, and electricity meters. Among them, the Shanghai Steam Turbine Factory, the Shanghai Diesel Engine Factory, and others have comprehensively completed the five main indicators of the 1957 First Five-Year Plan, and the Shanghai Second Textile Machinery Factory has completed the cumulative production value figures of the First Five-Year Plan.

In the first three years or so of the First Five-Year Plan, the production capacity and technical level of these factories have improved rapidly. The Shanghai Machine Tool Factory has successfully trial-produced twenty-one types of Soviet-style surface and cylindrical grinding machines, as well as special grinding machines for ball bearings, crankshafts, splines, etc. The Shanghai Steam Turbine Factory has mastered the technology of manufacturing 6,000 kW steam turbines, so this year it has also trial-produced 12,000 kW steam turbines, which were not originally included in the First Five-Year Plan, and is striving to complete the trial production of this major new product before the end of this year.

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 11th—By the end of August, the total output value of fifteen large factories and mines in Chongqing had reached the 1957 level ahead of schedule. This is the first batch of large factories and mines in Chongqing to reach the production value level of the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. The output of twelve major products, including open-hearth steel, electric furnace steel, cement, electricity, raw coal, coke, potassium chlorate, transformers, mulberry silk, paper, worsted woolen fabrics, and spun silk, from fourteen factories and mines has also reached the 1957 planned targets.

Since the beginning of this year, factories and mines in Chongqing have taken measures in various aspects to improve the production level of major products. Chongqing Iron and Steel Company expanded a large open-hearth furnace this year, added hot charging equipment for the open-hearth furnace, and further promoted the advanced experience of rapid steelmaking. From January to August this year, the company's steel output increased by 57% compared with the same period last year, equivalent to 90% of the planned output for 1957. This year, Chongqing Cement Plant promoted advanced experience such as long-term safe operation, and put a newly built cement mill into production ahead of schedule. The output in the first eight months of this year was close to the level of the whole of last year. The cement output of this factory exceeded the 1957 level by 3.1%. According to the rapid growth of electricity consumption in Chongqing, Chongqing Power Plant has given full play to the production capacity of the equipment. Under the same equipment conditions, the power generation from January to August this year also increased by more than 30% compared with the same period last year.

    上海三十三个重工业工厂、重庆十五个大厂矿
    提前达到1957年生产总值水平
    新华社上海11日电　上海现在已经有三十三个国营和中央公私合营重工业工厂，提前达到1957年的生产总值水平，这些厂约占上海有五年计划指标的国营和中央公私合营重工业工厂总数的三分之二。
    这三十三个工厂是上海制造汽轮机、机床、柴油机、锅炉、船舶、电线、电池、开关、电表等重要产品的主要工厂。其中，上海汽轮机厂、上海柴油机厂等已经全面完成了第一个五年计划的1957年的五项主要指标，上海第二纺织机械厂已经完成了第一个五年计划的生产总值累计数字。
    在第一个五年计划的前三年多里，这些工厂的生产能力和技术水平都提高得很快。上海机床厂已经试制成功了二十一种苏联式平面、外圆磨床，以及滚珠、曲轴、花键等专用磨床。上海汽轮机厂已经掌握了制造六千瓩汽轮机的技术，因此今年又提前试制原来没有列入第一个五年计划的一万二千瓩汽轮机，并且争取在今年年底以前完成这项重大新产品的试制任务。
    新华社重庆11日电　到8月底止，重庆市有十五个大型厂矿的生产总值提前达到了1957年的水平。这是重庆市第一批提前达到五年计划生产总值水平的大型厂矿。有十四个厂矿的平炉钢、电炉钢、水泥、电力、原煤、焦炭、氯酸钾、变压器、家蚕丝、纸张、精纺毛织品、绢丝等十二种主要产品的产量，也达到了1957年的计划指标。
    今年以来，重庆市各厂矿从各方面采取措施，提高主要产品的生产水平。重庆钢铁公司今年扩建了大型平炉。增加了平炉热装设备，并且进一步推广了快速炼钢的先进经验。今年1至8月份，这个公司钢的产量比去年同期提高57％，相当于1957年计划产量的90％。重庆水泥厂今年推广了长期安全运转等先进经验，并将一座新建的水泥磨提前投入生产，今年八个月来的产量接近去年全年的水平。这个工厂的水泥产量超过了1957年水平的3.1％。重庆发电厂根据重庆市用电量迅速增长的情况，充分发挥了设备的生产能力，在同样设备条件下，今年1至8月份的发电量也比去年同期增长了30％以上。
