Xinhua News Agency, Yangon, 8th: The "People's Daily" of Mandalay said in an editorial that the Burmese people support the government's statement expressing a willingness to resolve the border issues between Burma and China in a friendly and peaceful manner.

The editorial said, "We firmly believe that this issue can be resolved through face-to-face discussions between the two relevant countries."

The editorial pointed out that rumors about the border situation are all fabricated by imperialists who are trying to restore the old situation and undermine friendly relations between Asian countries in order to exploit them.

The editorial said, "We hope to let the imperialists understand that despite their attempts, the Burmese people will never harm their existing friendship with China for the benefit of the imperialists."

Xinhua News Agency, 8th: According to Western news agencies' reports from Bangkok, Thai Prime Minister Phibun made successive speeches on September 6th and 7th, slandering China with "aggressive" actions against Burma. He said that his so-called Chinese "aggression" had been confirmed by the Thai intelligence service. He also said: "If the United Nations decides to take action against the Communists, Thailand will participate in such action."

A United Press dispatch from Bangkok on September 6th pointed out that Phibun's current attitude is significantly different from his attitude a month ago. United Press said: "When the initial news of the Communist invasion of Burma reached here (Bangkok), Phibun said at a press conference that the news was exaggerated and the problem was not serious."

Phibun's sudden outcry of Chinese "aggression" was made when the advisory meeting of the Manila military group was being held in Baguio, Philippines. The meeting decided to establish the military staff headquarters of this US-controlled aggressive group in Bangkok, and Phibun welcomed the decision. However, Thai newspapers are worried that this will only make Thailand a "colony of a major power in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization."

    缅甸“人民报”发表社论
    希望和平友好解决边界问题
    銮披汶污蔑我国对缅甸有“侵略”行动
    新华社仰光8日电　曼德勒“人民报”在一篇社论中说，缅甸人民支持政府表示以友好和和平的方式解决缅甸和中国之间的边界问题的声明。
    社论说，“我们深信，这个问题可以由这两个有关国家当面讨论解决”。
    社论指出，关于边界局势的谣传都是帝国主义者所捏造出来的，他们企图恢复旧局势，破坏亚洲国家间的友好关系，以便他们剥削亚洲国家。
    社论说，“我们希望让帝国主义者了解，尽管他们有这种企图，缅甸人民无论怎样都不会为帝国主义者的利益而损害和中国的现有友谊”。
    新华社8日讯　据西方通讯社从曼谷报道，泰国总理銮披汶在9月6日和7日连续发表谈话，污蔑中国对缅甸有“侵略”行动。他说，他所谓的中国“侵略”行动已经得到泰国情报处的证实。他还说：“如果联合国决定对共产党人采取行动，泰国将参加这种行动”。
    合众社9月6日从曼谷发出的一条消息指出，銮披汶目前的态度同他一个月前的态度有显著的不同。合众社说：“当这里（曼谷）最初得到关于共产党侵入缅甸的消息的时候，銮披汶在一次记者招待会上说，这种消息是过分夸大了，这个问题并不严重”。
    銮披汶突然叫嚷中国“侵略”的谈话是发表在马尼拉军事集团的顾问会议正在菲律宾的碧瑶开会的时候。这次会议决定把这个美国操纵下的侵略集团的军事参谋总部设在曼谷，銮披汶对这个决定表示欢迎。但是，泰国报纸却担心这只会使泰国成为“东南亚条约组织的大国的一个殖民地”。
