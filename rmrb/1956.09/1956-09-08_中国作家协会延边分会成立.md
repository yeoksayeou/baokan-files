    Yanbian Branch of the Chinese Writers Association Established

    (Our report) The Yanbian Branch of the Chinese Writers Association was officially established on August 15th. This is the first branch of the Writers Association established in a minority nationality area in our country.

    Literary work in the Yanbian area has greatly developed in recent years. The current ratio of the population to publications in the region is such that each person can read an average of two and a half new books per year. The veteran writer Cui Jingyuan has continuously produced new works in recent years, which are very popular with readers. The veteran poets Li Xu and Xu Xian have recently written new poems. The novels of Li Hongkui and Jin Xuetie and the plays of Huang Fenglong have a wide impact in this area. The one-act short plays written by Huang Fenglong are frequently performed in rural areas, and his new work "What Happened in Spring" (a three-act play) has also been well received. In addition, the novels of Li Genquan and Jin Dongjiu, the poems of Zhu Shanyu and Ren Hao, the essays of Cui Xianshu (female), and the folk tales compiled by Zheng Jiyun have all achieved certain accomplishments.

    At the inaugural meeting of the branch, Cui Cai was elected as chairman, and Pei Ke, Jin Chunji, Zheng Jiyun, and Cui Jingyuan were elected as vice chairmen; Li Hongkui, Huang Fenglong, and ten others were elected as directors. The branch currently has 39 members. The Korean nationality has the most members, but there are also Han and Hui nationalities.

    The main tasks of the branch in the future are: to actively mobilize creative forces and improve the level of creation in accordance with the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend"; to promote excellent national traditions and sort out the rich national heritage; to strengthen the translation work of various national literatures and exchange experiences in literary work among various nationalities.

    分会成立大会上选出崔彩为主席，裴克、金淳基、郑吉云、崔静渊为副主席；李弘奎、黄凤龙等十二人为理事。现在分会共有会员三十九人。会员中朝鲜族最多，也有汉族和回族。
