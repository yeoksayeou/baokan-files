    An Autumn Night's Talk of Mars
    Lǐ Yuán
    In the cool and clear autumn night, bright and red Mars adds a lot of brilliance and interest to the starry sky for us. Recently, after eight o'clock every night, Mars rises from the southeastern horizon. It is brighter than any other star in the nearby sky, and it is easy to find no matter where you are.
    What makes Mars so big and bright, so eye-catching? Because it is close to the Earth. On September 7 this year, its distance from us is only 56 million kilometers, which is the closest Mars has been to Earth. This happens on average every fifteen or seventeen years.
    Now, Mars is about to visit the closest place to Earth, and those who will receive and visit this distant guest will not only be some scientists, astronomers, and journalists, but also all of us. Because this planet, which has long been regarded as "mysterious," has aroused many people's suspicions and fantasies. Does life exist on Mars? Are there humans? These questions are of particular interest, and everyone is eager for science to reveal the secrets of Mars to us.
    Since people observed Mars with telescopes, they have discovered various changes in the shapes and colors of the Martian surface.
    In a large telescope, you can see the white caps at the two poles of Mars, called polar caps. The size and shape of the polar caps change with the seasons. They become larger in winter and smaller in summer. They are likely to be a thin layer of ice and snow gathered at the poles of Mars.
    Most of the surface of Mars is orange. It is speculated that most of the surface of Mars is composed of deserts. But there are also some dark green spots on the orange surface of Mars, which people once called "seas," but there is no sea water there. These dark green parts also change with the seasons. When spring comes, the ice and snow of the polar caps are melting, and these green "seas" receive precious water, and under the sunlight, they begin to regenerate. Just like forests and grasslands on Earth, they change their colors.
    Some astronomical observers have also discovered many intersecting thin lines and stripes on the surface of Mars, which they once called "canals." Some people believe that these "canals" were dug by "Martians" with high intelligence, and they even said that they sent telegrams to earthlings! This statement was once popular. Novelist Wells even wrote a book called "The War of the Worlds" based on this theme. An American radio station once based its broadcast on this novel, adding real place names, and carried out a broadcast of "Martians" attacking the Earth. As a result, thousands of American residents believed it to be true, and suddenly panicked, even saying that they had smelled the poison gas released by the "Martians." In reality, of course, this did not happen, and it is also one of the boring American lifestyles.
    Regarding the ice and snow at the poles of Mars, the green "seas," the huge "canals," and even the telegrams from "Martians" mentioned above, are these fascinating things really true? Can it be proved that there is indeed life on Mars, or even humans? Even the most experienced astronomers do not know more about these questions than ordinary people. If you ask an astronomer about the things mentioned above, you are likely to get a very humble answer: those things may all exist on Mars, but no definitive scientific evidence has been obtained. Maybe he will add some of his own views on this matter. He believes that Mars is a cold world, where the air is thinner than the air on the highest mountains on Earth, and water vapor and oxygen are even scarcer; it is mainly a cold and dry desert, definitely not an ideal paradise for life to exist.
    For life, the conditions on Mars are too harsh, but the tenacity and adaptability of life are also very high. Therefore, as the Soviet expert on Mars research, the founder of astrobotany, Tikhov, pointed out, the existence of some lower plants on Mars is still very possible.
    Until now, Mars still has many "secrets" that have not been revealed to us. Scientists cherish every opportunity for Mars to be closest to Earth in order to explore the truth about Mars. Since the last time Mars approached Earth in 1939, the world's largest 200-inch telescope has been built, and radio, radar, television, and other technologies have been applied to scientific work in exploring the universe. Therefore, when Mars is closest to Earth this year, "Earthlings" have more powerful scientific weapons to explore Mars. We look forward to obtaining more new knowledge from Mars.
    Of course, to completely uncover the secrets of Mars, we still need to have direct contact with Mars. A Soviet scientist recently expressed his view: when Mars approaches Earth again in 1971, mankind may have already established interstellar travel tools to directly visit our neighbor Mars.

    秋夜谈火星
    李杬
    凉爽清明的秋夜里，明亮而发红的火星在星空中为我们增添了不少的光彩和趣味。近来每晚八点钟以后，火星就从东南方的地平线升起。它比附近天空中的任何一个星星都亮，不论你在那里，都很容易找到它。
    是什么原因使火星变得又大又亮，十分引人注目呢？因为它靠近了地球。今年9月7日，它和我们的距离只有五千六百万公里，这是火星离地球最近的时候。平均每隔十五年或十七年就发生一次。
    现在，火星将要到同地球最接近的地方来作客了，接待和访问这位远客的，将不只是一些科学家、天文学家和新闻记者们，而且还有我们大家在内。因为，很久以来被视为“神秘”的行星，曾引起了人们许多的猜疑和幻想。火星上到底有没有生命？有没有人类？这些问题是特别使人感到兴趣的，大家渴望着科学来给我们揭开火星的秘密。
    人们自从用望远镜观测了火星之后，就发现火星表面的种种形状和色彩的变化。
    在大望远镜里，可以看到火星两极的白色帽子，叫做极冠。极冠的大小和形状是随着季节而变化的。冬季变大，夏季缩小。它们很可能是聚集在火星两极的一层薄的冰和雪。
    火星表面的大部分都是橙色的，据推想，火星表面大部分是由沙漠组成的。但在火星的橙色表面上，也有一些暗绿色斑点的存在，人们曾经把它叫做“海”，其实那里是没有海水的。这些暗绿色的部分，也是随着季节而变化的。当春天到来的时候，极冠的冰雪正在溶化，而这些绿色的“海”得到了宝贵的水份以后，在太阳光下，它们开始了新生。就像地球上的森林和草原一样，改变着自己的颜色。
    有些天文观测家，还发现火星表面有许多互相交错的细线和条纹，曾经把它叫做“运河”，有人认为这些“运河”是由有很高智慧的“火星人”开凿的，并且说他们还给地球人来过电报！这种说法居然也曾风行一时。小说家威尔斯还以此为体裁写了一本“星球间的战争”。美国的一家电台有一次就依据了这本小说，加上实在地名，进行了“火星人”进攻地球的广播，结果有几千个美国居民信以为真，突然地惊慌起来，甚至说已经闻到了“火星人”所放的毒气。实际上自然没有这会事，这也是无聊的美国生活方式之一。
    关于上面说到的那些火星两极的冰雪、绿色的“海”、巨大的“运河”、以至于“火星人”来的电报等等这些令人神往的东西，到底是不是真有？是否可以从而证明火星上确实有生命，甚至有人类存在呢？这些问题，即使是最有经验的天文学家也并不比普通人懂得更多。假如你向一位天文学家问到上面所说的那些东西，你很可能得到一个很谦虚的答复：那一些，火星上也许都有，但是还没有得到确切的科学证据。也许他再加上一些自己对于这件事情的看法。他认为火星是一个寒冷的世界，那里的空气比地球上最高的山上的空气还要稀薄，水蒸气和氧气更是少得可怜；那里主要是一片严寒而干燥的沙漠，决不是一个生命存在的理想乐园。
    对生命说来，火星上的条件未免是太苛刻了一些，但是生命的顽强性和适应性也是很高的。所以正如苏联研究火星的专家、天文植物学的创始人奇霍夫所指出的那样，在火星上有某些低等植物的存在，还是非常可能的事。
    直到现在，火星依然有很多“秘密”没有为我们揭开。科学家们十分珍惜每一次火星最接近地球的机会，以探测火星的真象。从上次1939年火星接近地球以来，世界最大的二百吋望远镜建立起来了，无线电、雷达、电视等等都应用到探测宇宙的科学工作中了，因此当今年火星最接近地球的时候，“地球人”拥有了更有力的科学武器来探测火星。我们期望着得到更多从火星上来的新知识。
    当然，想要彻底揭开火星的秘密，还有待于我们与火星的直接联系，一位苏联科学家最近曾发表了他的看法：当1971年火星再一次最近地球的时候，人类很可能已经建立起星际航行的工具，直接去访问我们的邻居火星了。（附图片）
