The steel enterprises under the Steel Bureau of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry have promoted some important advanced Soviet experiences in ironmaking and steelmaking. Over the past six months, they have achieved considerable results. For example, the advanced experience of rapid combustion in hot blast stoves has been implemented in blast furnaces, and the air temperature of each plant has increased to varying degrees. The advanced experience of self-fluxing sintered ore in blast furnaces has also been promoted relatively well, and each plant has basically met the requirements of the Bureau. In the first half of the year, the utilization coefficient of effective volume of blast furnaces in the whole bureau decreased by 5.9% compared with 1955. In terms of open-hearth steelmaking, advanced experience in rapid steelmaking has been fully implemented, and the smelting time in each plant has been further shortened. In the first half of the year, it was shortened by 9.2% compared with the fourth quarter of 1955. Tianjin Steel Plant and Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant shortened it by about twenty to thirty minutes.

This newspaper also reports that from January to July this year, the ordinary steel plants under the Steel Bureau of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry put forward a total of 23,484 rationalization proposals, more than double the number of last year. More than 42% of these suggestions have been adopted. Among them, more than 5,400 have been implemented in production, and the value that can be calculated alone has increased the country's wealth by more than 3 million yuan. The implementation of some of the more important proposals has played a significant role in improving production, improving product quality, and reducing costs. For example, when a certain furnace in the open-hearth furnace workshop of Tianjin Steel Plant was overhauled in the first quarter of this year, the workers put forward 139 rationalization proposals in response to the problems in past dismantling and repairs, and 82 were adopted, making the overhaul time the highest record of 67.42 minutes and 53.20 minutes for cold repairs in medium-sized open-hearth furnaces in the country. The rolling mill workers of the fourth branch of this plant jointly studied and put forward a suggestion to increase the efficiency of rolling steel production by 2.52%, which can create a wealth of more than 279,000 yuan for the country throughout the year. The rolling mill workers and technicians of the rolling mills of Shanghai Iron and Steel Company studied and improved the rolling technology to ensure the quality of round steel. Lin Shanfu, a comrade from the Tenth Steel Plant of this company, designed and modified the "universal rolling mill" to ensure the supply of channel-shaped agricultural tool steel for double-wheeled ploughs, and created favorable conditions for increasing new varieties of steel in the future.

    钢铁局所属企业积极推行主要的先进经验
    生铁产量增加炼钢速度加快
    本报讯　冶金工业部钢铁工业管理局所属企业，在炼铁和炼钢方面推广一些重要的苏联先进经验，半年多来，已获得了较大成绩，如高炉推行热风炉快速燃烧先进经验，各厂风温均有不同程度的提高。高炉自熔性烧结矿先进经验的推广工作进行得也比较好，各厂基本上都已达到管理局的要求。在上半年，全局高炉有效容积利用系数比1955年降低了5.9％。在平炉炼钢方面，全面推行了快速炼钢的先进经验，各厂的冶炼时间进一步缩短了，上半年比1955年第四季度缩短了9.2％，天津钢厂和上海第一钢厂缩短了约二十到三十分钟左右。
    本报讯　冶金工业部钢铁工业管理局所属各普通钢厂今年1至7月份共提出合理化建议二万三千四百八十四件，比去年增加了一倍多。这些建议有42％以上都被采纳了。其中已在生产中实现的即有五千四百多件，仅就能计算的价值就给国家增加了三百多万元的财富。一些比较重大的建议实行以后，对改进生产、提高产品质量和降低成本起了很大的作用。如天津钢厂平炉车间今年第一季度某号炉进行中修时，工人群众针对过去拆修中的问题，提出一百三十九项合理化建议，采纳了八十二项，使这次中修时间创造了全国中型平炉中冷修六十七点四十二分和五十三点二十分的最高纪录。这个厂的四分厂轧钢工人共同研究，提出一项建议，使轧钢生产效率提高2.52％，全年可给国家创造财富二十七万九千多元。上海钢铁公司的各轧钢厂的轧钢工人和技术人员，研究改进轧制技术，使元钢的质量得到保证。这个公司的第十钢厂林善福同志，设计和改装了“万能式轧钢机”保证了双轮带铧犁用的槽形农具钢的供应，并对今后增加钢材新品种创造了有利条件。
