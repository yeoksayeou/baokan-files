Xinhua News Agency report: Yunnan University's History Department has added courses this semester such as "Overview of Yunnan Ethnic History," "History of the Dai People," and "Historical Materials of Yunnan Ethnic History," which began on the 10th.

The History Department began offering specialized courses in Yunnan ethnic history last year. Professors in the department, including Fang Guoyu (Naxi), Yang Kun, and Jiang Yingliang, have respectively compiled lecture notes on the History of the Dai People, History of the Bai People, Marxist-Leninist Theory on Ethnic Issues, and China's Ethnic Policies. They are also preparing to write manuscripts on topics such as Yi society, the Tusi system in Yunnan's history, specific analyses of ethnic wars in Yunnan's history, and methods of ethnographic investigation and research during the teaching period, in order to prepare for courses next semester.

In conjunction with teaching work, the professors in the History Department who study ethnic history will carry out scientific research focused on the history of Yunnan's ethnic groups. Within twelve years, they will gradually research and write specialized works on the History of the Yi People, History of the Dai People, History of Nanzhao, History of Han Chinese Immigration to Yunnan, and theories and policies related to ethnic issues. To this end, the History Department has also established a dedicated reading room to collect, copy, translate, and excavate historical materials and ancient artifacts of ethnic minorities within Yunnan.

    培养少数民族历史科学研究人才
    云南大学增设少数民族专门课程
    据新华社讯　云南大学历史系这学期增设的“云南民族史概述”、“傣族史”、“云南民族史史料学”等课程，从10日起陆续上课。
    历史系从去年起就开设了云南民族史专门化课程。现在这个系的教授方国瑜（纳西族）、杨堃、江应梁等人已分别编写了傣族史、白族史、马克思列宁主义关于民族问题理论及中国民族政策等讲义。他们还准备在教学期间编写关于彝族社会、云南历代的土司制度、云南历史上民族战争的具体分析、民族学调查研究方法等讲稿，为下学期开课作好准备。
    结合教学工作，历史系研究民族史的教授，将开展以云南民族历史为中心的科学研究工作。在十二年内，他们将逐步研究和编写出彝族史、傣族史、南诏史、汉族移民云南史以及有关民族问题的理论和政策等专题。历史系为此还专门成立了资料室，搜集、汇抄、翻译和发掘云南境内少数民族的历史资料和古代文物。
