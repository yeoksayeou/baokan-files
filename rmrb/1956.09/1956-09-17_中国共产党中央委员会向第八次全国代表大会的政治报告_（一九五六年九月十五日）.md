Comrades!

Eleven years have passed since the Seventh National Congress of our Party. During this period, our motherland has experienced two great historical events of world significance. In 1949, our Party led the people to overthrow the reactionary rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism and established the People's Republic of China. In the latter half of last year and the first half of this year, our Party again led the people to achieve decisive victories in the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce. Due to these two victories, the internal and external relations of our country have undergone a series of fundamental changes.

Except for Taiwan, which is still occupied by American aggressors, the imperialist forces that have been riding on the heads of the Chinese people for nearly a century have been driven out. China has become a great independent and autonomous country.

The foreign imperialists' tool—the bureaucratic comprador bourgeoisie—has been eliminated on the mainland of China.

The landlord class, except in a few isolated areas, has also been eliminated. The rich peasant class is also in the process of being eliminated. Former exploiters of the peasants, the landlords, and rich peasants are being transformed into self-reliant new people.

Members of the national bourgeoisie are in the process of transitioning from exploiters to laborers.

The vast majority of peasants and other individual laborers have become collective laborers for socialism.

The working class has become the leading class of the state. Its ranks have expanded, and its level of consciousness and cultural and technical standards have greatly improved.

The intellectual community has also changed its original face and has become a force serving socialism.

The various nationalities within the country have formed a united and friendly national family.

The united front of the people, led by the Communist Party, has been further expanded and consolidated.

Our country has joined the socialist camp led by the Soviet Union, which is striving for lasting peace and human progress, and has established unbreakable friendly and cooperative relations with the great Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries. Our people, in the victorious War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, stopped the aggression of the imperialist aggressors. Our country adheres to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence in international relations. Our international status has been elevated.

All these changes not only arouse the unprecedented revolutionary enthusiasm of the 600 million people of China but also have a great attraction in the world and among all oppressed nations and all exploited peoples.

The current task of our Party is to rely on the hundreds of millions of people who have been liberated and organized, to unite all possible forces at home and abroad, to fully utilize all favorable conditions, and to build our country into a great socialist country as quickly as possible.

To accomplish this enormous task, we must correctly summarize our experiences in the past period, continue to complete the socialist transformation of our country, further strengthen our socialist construction, further improve our political life, correctly handle international affairs, and further consolidate our Party. The discussions and decisions of our Congress on all these issues will promote our Party and the people of our country to achieve new and greater victories on the basis of the victories already achieved.

**(1) The General Line for the Transition Period**

Eleven years ago, the Seventh National Congress of our Party proposed to the whole Party the task of "mobilizing the masses to the fullest extent, expanding the strength of the people, uniting all possible forces in the country, defeating the aggressors, and building a new China." This task has been accomplished in 1949.

Reactionaries often choose the path to their own destruction. The policy of the Seventh National Congress of our Party was to urge the Kuomintang to form a coalition government with the democratic forces of the whole country. As early as the initial period of the War of Resistance Against Japan, our Party had reached an agreement with the Kuomintang to form a united front against Japan. Later, especially after the end of the War of Resistance Against Japan, our Party had repeatedly engaged in peaceful negotiations with the Kuomintang to avoid civil war and to try to achieve China's social and political reforms through peaceful means. In 1946, we and several democratic parties reached an agreement with the Kuomintang on peaceful national construction. However, the Kuomintang reactionaries, with the support of American imperialism, launched a nationwide civil war, attempting to eliminate the forces representing the Chinese people—the Communist Party of China and all other progressive democratic forces. They were wrong. When we were striving for peaceful reform, we did not let down our guard and did not disarm the people. Our policy was: if the Kuomintang was willing to make peace and was willing to carry out reforms under peaceful conditions, this would be beneficial to the people and something we would strive for. However, we knew that the realization of the desire for peace did not depend on us but on the then ruling class. If the Kuomintang reactionaries insisted on imposing war on the people, then we were fully prepared to mobilize the strength of the people to defeat them and make the war instigators suffer the consequences. History has made this conclusion. Those who wanted to eliminate the people's forces were themselves eliminated by the people's forces.

In contrast to the reactionaries, the people are not warlike. Even during the war, in places where peaceful liberation was possible, such as Beijing, Suiyuan, Changsha, Kunming, western Sichuan, Xinjiang, and Tibet, we did peace negotiations and achieved peaceful liberation. However, when the people were forced to take up arms, it was completely correct for the people to do so. To oppose the people doing this and to demand that the people surrender to the attacking enemy is the opportunist line. Here, the question of whether to adopt the revolutionary line or the opportunist line is a major issue concerning whether the 600 million people should seize power when the time is ripe. Our Party adopted the revolutionary line, and therefore we have the People's Republic of China today.

After the founding of the People's Republic of China, due to the fact that the working class, in alliance with hundreds of millions of peasants, had gained ruling power on a national scale, the working class's party, the Communist Party of China, became the leading party of the national government, and the people's democratic dictatorship had essentially become a form of proletarian dictatorship. This made it possible for our country's bourgeois democratic revolution to directly transition to a proletarian socialist revolution through a peaceful path. Therefore, the founding of the People's Republic of China marked the basic end of the stage of the bourgeois democratic revolution in our country and the beginning of the stage of the proletarian socialist revolution, marking the beginning of the transition period from capitalism to socialism in our country.

What are the basic characteristics of our country's transition period?

First, our country is an industrially backward country. To build a socialist society, we must develop socialist industry, primarily heavy industry, to transform our country from a backward agricultural country into an advanced industrial country, and this will take a considerable amount of time.

Second, in our country, the allies of the working class are not only peasants and urban petty bourgeoisie but also the national bourgeoisie. Therefore, to transform the old economy, not only do we need to adopt peaceful transformation methods for agriculture and handicrafts, but we also need to adopt peaceful transformation methods for capitalist industry and commerce, and this needs to be done gradually and will take time.

The Central Committee of the Party, based on the specific situation of our country, formulated the general line of our Party for the transition period, which is: to gradually realize socialist industrialization and gradually complete the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce over a relatively long period. The Party's general line was proposed at the end of the period of economic recovery in 1952 and was accepted by the National People's Congress in 1954 as the state's general task for the transition period and was recorded in the Constitution of the People's Republic of China.

The general line of the Party for the transition period is the beacon that guides all our work. All work that deviates from it will result in right or "left" errors. In the past few years, the main tendency to deviate from the Party's general line from the right has been to be satisfied with the achievements of the bourgeois democratic revolution, to demand that the revolution be halted, to not acknowledge the necessity of our revolution transitioning to socialism, to be unwilling to adopt appropriate restrictive policies towards cities and the countryside, to not believe that the Party can lead the peasants to socialism, and to not believe that the Party can lead the people of the whole country to build socialism. The main tendency to deviate from the Party's general line from the "left" has been to demand that socialism be realized "overnight," to demand that the national bourgeoisie be eliminated in our country through expropriation, or to drive capitalist industry and commerce to bankruptcy through exclusion, to not acknowledge that the transition to socialism should be done gradually, and to not believe that we can achieve the goal of the socialist revolution through peaceful means. Our Party has resolutely rejected and criticized these two erroneous tendencies. It is clear that if our Party accepts any of these views, we will not be able to build socialism or build socialism as smoothly as we do today.

According to the general line for the transition period, our country began the first Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy in 1953. The Central Committee of the Party originally estimated that it would take approximately three five-year plans to complete the general tasks of the transition period. The practice of the first Five-Year Plan has proven that to complete the industrialization of the state, three five-year plans are necessary, or even a little more time. However, the task of socialist transformation has been basically completed during the first Five-Year Plan, and it will be completely completed during the second Five-Year Plan, except in a few isolated areas.

**(2) Socialist Transformation**

The socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce in our country has now achieved decisive victories.

According to statistics from June this year, out of 120 million rural households nationwide, 110 million households have joined agricultural producers' cooperatives, accounting for 91.7% of the total number of households. Among these, 35 million households have joined primary cooperatives, and 75 million households, or the majority, have joined advanced cooperatives. The mutual aid and cooperative movement in animal husbandry has also developed.

All individual handicraft workers have joined various forms of production cooperatives. Those who have joined industrial production cooperatives, production teams, or supply and marketing cooperatives account for 90% of the total number of individual handicraft workers. Individual fishermen, salt workers, and individual laborers in the transportation industry have also basically achieved cooperation.

The capitalist industry and commerce in the country have basically achieved full industry public-private joint operations. Individual small commerce has also basically achieved cooperation, performing the business of state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce.

These achievements were mainly achieved in the high tide of the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce in our country, which began in the second half of 1955.

The appearance of this high tide of socialist transformation was not accidental but was the inevitable result of the maturation of various social conditions in our country since 1949.

After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the people's government expropriated all the enterprises of bureaucratic capital that controlled the lifelines of the national economy, including those taken over by the Kuomintang government after the victory of the War of Resistance, such as the enterprises of Japan, Germany, and Italy in China, and turned them into state-owned socialist enterprises. This laid the foundation for the superior position of socialist economy in our country.

The people's government then made great efforts to develop state-owned industry, transportation, and other state-owned enterprises. The output value of state-owned industry, which accounted for only 26.3% of the total industrial output value in 1949, increased to 41.5% in 1952 and to 51.3% in 1955.

The people's government then transformed all private banks and money shops into unified public-private joint banks under the leadership of the state bank, centralized the operation of bank credit, insurance business, and the trading of gold, silver, and foreign currency by the state. The people's government established foreign trade control and managed foreign exchange. The people's government also established a strong unified state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce nationwide, controlled the main industrial raw materials and sources of goods, gradually realized the nationalization of wholesale commerce, and consolidated the leading position of socialist commerce in the national market.

The development of a powerful socialist economy enabled us to obtain the material foundation for carrying out the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce. However, to complete the task of socialist transformation, we must also adopt policies and steps that suit our country's situation, so that the vast majority of peasants and handicraft workers in our country will be willing to join the collective economy, and the national bourgeoisie will not be too reluctant to accept the socialist transformation.

What policies and steps have we adopted? Now, we will briefly explain the transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce separately.

First, we will explain the socialist transformation of agriculture.

The agricultural cooperation movement in our country was carried out on the basis of the thorough completion of land reform. Our Party did not adopt the method of relying solely on administrative orders and "granting" land to peasants to carry out land reform. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, we spent three whole years using the mass line method of thoroughly mobilizing the peasant masses, fully arousing the class consciousness of the peasants, especially the poor peasants, and through the struggle of the peasants themselves, completing this task. We spent so much time, was it necessary? We believe it was completely necessary. Because we adopted this method, the vast majority of peasants stood up, organized, and firmly grasped the political power and weapons of the countryside, closely following the Communist Party and the people's government. Therefore, land reform not only eliminated the landlord class economically and greatly weakened the rich peasants but also thoroughly defeated the landlord class politically and isolated the rich peasants. The vast majority of awakened peasants regarded the exploitative behavior of both landlords and rich peasants as shameful. This created favorable conditions for the subsequent socialist transformation of agriculture and greatly shortened the time needed for agricultural cooperation.

In the rural population of old China, 60% to 70% were poor peasants and hired laborers, who were semi-proletarians and proletarians in the countryside, and who were easily led by the working class. They not only had great enthusiasm in the bourgeois democratic revolution but also had great enthusiasm in the socialist revolution. After land reform, the economic status of the vast majority of peasants improved, and many poor peasants and hired laborers rose to become middle peasants. However, due to the scarcity of land in our rural areas, the average per capita land area in the country is only 3 mu (approximately one-fifth of a hectare), and in many places in the south, each person has only 1 mu of land or only a few fractions of a mu, so in the countryside, 60% to 70% of the poor peasants and lower-middle peasants still exist. Under the condition of continuing individual operation, it is uncertain whether they can live a prosperous life. This made the majority of poor peasants and non-rich peasants in the countryside actively respond to our Party's call and were willing to take the path of cooperation.

After land reform, we immediately established mutual aid organizations with socialist germs among the peasants on a large scale. This is a collective labor organization of peasants. Because mutual aid is superior to "single farming," by 1952, 40% of the total number of rural households in the country had joined mutual aid organizations, and by 1954, this number increased to nearly 58%. On the basis of mutual aid organizations, the Central Committee of the Party began to plan the development of semi-socialist agricultural producers' cooperatives in 1952. These are cooperatives with land as shares, unified management, but still retaining private ownership of land and major means of production. This type of cooperative, which was only a few hundred in number at the end of 1951, had developed to 670,000 by the first half of 1955, with approximately 17 million households participating. From the second half of 1955 onwards, as everyone knows, due to the Central Committee of the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong correcting the rightist conservative thoughts that suppressed the peasants' enthusiasm for cooperation, agricultural producers' cooperatives began to develop particularly rapidly. Subsequently, primary cooperatives began to be transformed en masse into advanced cooperatives that could more effectively organize production. In these cooperatives, land and other major means of production changed from private ownership to collective ownership. The facts have proven that our Party's adoption of this gradual approach is appropriate. Because this made the peasants continuously benefit from the cooperation movement, gradually adapt to the collective production method, and naturally and smoothly shed the private ownership of land and other major means of production, accepting collective ownership, thus avoiding or greatly reducing the various losses that might be caused by sudden changes.

In the agricultural cooperation movement, the Party's class policy is to establish the leadership advantage of poor peasants and lower-middle peasants who rose from poor peasants after land reform within the cooperative, while firmly uniting the middle peasants. Although wealthy and relatively wealthy middle peasants are in the minority in rural areas, they still have an important influence on lower-middle peasants and even poor peasants. These wealthy middle peasants generally support the Communist Party and the people's government, and many of them have "turned over" in land reform, but they inevitably have doubts about taking the path of cooperation. To consolidate the unity with middle peasants, the key here is to insist on the policy of voluntarism and mutual benefit in the cooperation movement. The policy of voluntarism and mutual benefit applies to everyone, but it is more important for middle peasants. The Party not only prohibits forcing middle peasants to join cooperatives but also stipulates that in the initial stage of cooperation development, the first to be attracted to join the cooperative are poor peasants and lower-middle peasants, and generally, relatively wealthy middle peasants are not attracted to join the cooperative. The Party also stipulates that before and after middle peasants join the cooperative, especially when handling the means of production when joining the cooperative, it is not allowed to harm their interests or take advantage of them; of course, it is not allowed for middle peasants to harm the interests of poor peasants or take advantage of them. The state's correct policy on grain issues also had a beneficial effect on middle peasants. Starting in 1953, the state implemented unified procurement and marketing for grain and other major agricultural products and set reasonable prices in the unified procurement and marketing, which basically eliminated the capitalist speculation of grain and other major agricultural products in the market. In 1955, the state also stipulated to limit the amount of grain purchased to a certain level, correcting the error of purchasing 70 billion jin of grain too much in the previous year, thus eliminating the farmers' concerns about the government purchasing too much. Due to the Party's unwavering implementation of the policy of uniting with middle peasants, and due to the middle peasants seeing the hopelessness of taking the capitalist path and the increasingly obvious advantages of cooperative production, the vast majority of middle peasants finally stopped wavering and actively sought to join the cooperative in the high tide of cooperation.

As for the original landlord elements and rich peasant elements, the Party has paid consistent attention in the past few years to leading the peasants to prevent and resist their sabotage activities in the cooperation movement and prohibiting them from joining cooperatives in the initial stage of cooperation. Only after the cooperation movement achieved victory did the Party decide to allow them to engage in equal-pay labor in the cooperative with different identities, according to their specific situations, to transform them into new people.

Due to the implementation of the above policies, we were able to basically complete the socialist transformation of agriculture nationwide in less than four years after the completion of land reform, organizing 110 million rural households into approximately 1 million advanced and primary agricultural producers' cooperatives of various sizes.

Next, we will explain the socialist transformation of handicrafts and other individual economies.

The vast majority of individual handicraft laborers in our country, except in a very small range, can produce and sell by themselves, and they all depend on state-owned commerce, supply and marketing cooperatives, and capitalist enterprises to supply raw materials, sell finished products, and lend funds. Most of them live in difficulty, and there is no insurance for illness and injury. Their production technology is mostly backward and has the possibility of being eliminated by modern machine production. Therefore, they hope to unite and overcome these difficulties under the leadership of the state economy. From the perspective of the overall interests of the national economy, many handicraft productions must be continued and developed, not only to meet the broad needs of the domestic market but also partly to meet the needs of export trade. China's individual fishermen, salt workers, small merchants, peddlers, and individual laborers in the transportation industry also have a large number, and their situation is similar to that of handicraft workers.

For the socialist transformation of handicrafts, fisheries, salt industry, and transportation, the general approach is to adopt the form of cooperation. The cooperation movement in these areas has developed to some extent over the past few years. By 1955, the number of people joining handicraft production cooperatives accounted for 29% of the total number of handicraft workers. The large-scale development of handicrafts and other individual economies' cooperation was in the first half of this year. Newly established cooperatives, some of which developed through the transitional form of production teams, were mostly organized directly in the cooperation high tide this year. In addition, a small part of handicrafts and a small part of capitalistically operated wooden sailboats and animal-drawn carts were jointly operated with capitalist industry and commerce.

Small merchants and peddlers are individual commercial laborers. In the socialist transformation, except for a part that was jointly operated with capitalist commerce, they generally also took the path of cooperation, forming cooperative stores or cooperative groups. The cooperative groups organized by small merchants and peddlers perform the business of state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce, while still adopting the convenient and mobile operating methods that meet the needs of consumers, and still retaining their original operating characteristics that meet social needs.

Finally, we will explain the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce.

In our country, the large bourgeoisie that once held the dominant position was mainly the bureaucratic comprador bourgeoisie, which, as mentioned earlier, has been eliminated by the revolution. In old China, the national bourgeoisie had contradictions with imperialism, feudal forces, and bureaucratic capital. They had two sides in the bourgeois democratic revolution: on the one hand, they were willing to participate in the struggle against imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionary rule under certain conditions; on the other hand, they often showed vacillation and compromise in the struggle. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, they expressed support for the people's democratic dictatorship, the Common Program, and the Constitution, expressed their willingness to continue to oppose imperialism, and supported land reform; however, they also had a strong desire to develop capitalism. Therefore, our policy towards the national bourgeoisie, as in the past, is still a policy of both unity and struggle, seeking unity through struggle. That is to say, on the basis of the worker-peasant alliance, the working class still maintains a political alliance with the national bourgeoisie. In the economy, capitalist industry and commerce have two aspects: on the one hand, they have a beneficial effect on the national economy and the people's livelihood; on the other hand, they have a detrimental effect on the national economy and the people's livelihood. Therefore, the state adopts a policy of utilizing, restricting, and transforming capitalist industry and commerce. According to this policy, the working class has established an economic alliance with the national bourgeoisie and, within this alliance, achieved the leadership of the state economy over the capitalist economy, gradually transforming capitalist private ownership into socialist public ownership through various forms of state capitalism.

The state must adopt a policy of utilization for capitalist industry and commerce, not only because the national bourgeoisie has the possibility of accepting this policy but also because in the transition period, we have the necessity of utilizing capitalist industry and commerce in the economy. In the early days of national liberation, the national economy suffered serious damage from imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionary rule, and we faced the major task of restoring the national economy; at the same time, due to the backwardness of our economy and the dominance of small-scale production, we had to utilize all available economic forces to help with the work of restoring and building the national economy. Over the past few years, we have implemented the policy of "balancing public and private interests and benefiting both labor and capital" under the condition of prioritizing the development of state-owned economy, and in the allocation of raw materials and other issues, we have basically given "equal treatment" to the private economy. This has enabled private factory workers to avoid unemployment and also allowed capitalists to have a certain amount of profit. Due to this policy, capitalist industry and commerce that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood have been maintained and even developed to some extent. The facts have proven that capitalist industry and commerce have played an auxiliary role in many aspects in the period of national economic recovery and construction. The policy of utilization for capitalist industry and commerce has enabled the state to obtain more industrial products to exchange for farmers' grain, industrial raw materials, and other agricultural products, enabling the state to have a relatively sufficient supply of materials in the market, which is beneficial to the stability of prices. Of course, this policy of utilization is not to allow capitalism to develop freely. The state must adopt a policy of restriction for the aspects of capitalist industry and commerce that are detrimental to the national economy and the people's livelihood. This policy of restriction is inseparable from the policy of utilization.

The state's restriction of capitalist industry and commerce is in conflict with the narrow class interests of the bourgeoisie, so there are always many people in the bourgeoisie who express opposition or violate this restriction. The struggle between restriction and anti-restriction is the main form of class struggle within our country in recent years, reflecting the main class contradictions within our country—the contradictions between the working class and the bourgeoisie. Since the founding of the People's Republic, the state and capitalism have repeatedly and continuously struggled in terms of the scope of activities, taxation, market prices, and conditions for processing orders, unified procurement and marketing, and commission sales, and the working conditions of workers. Among these, the main ones are the struggle to stabilize prices and oppose speculative activities in the spring of 1950, and the "Five Anti" struggle in 1952 against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state assets, shoddy work, and theft of state economic intelligence. These struggles were carried out because many bourgeois elements engaged in illegal activities harmful to the national economy and the people's livelihood and had to be firmly stopped. In the process of these struggles, we paid attention to preventing and correcting the errors of over-restricting and over-rigidly restricting the capitalist economy. The basic policy of the Party and the state is to use these struggles to make those few bourgeois elements who insist on illegal behavior isolated in the people's masses and also within the bourgeoisie, while uniting the majority of bourgeois elements who are willing to obey state laws.

The state's implementation of the policy of utilization and restriction of capitalist industry and commerce is aimed at achieving the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce. This transformation is divided into two steps: the first step is to transform capitalism into state capitalism, and the second step is to transform state capitalism into socialism. What is state capitalism under the leadership of the proletarian state? As Lenin said: "This is a kind of capitalism that we can restrict and determine its scope." We use state capitalism as a transitional form to allow the national bourgeoisie to have a necessary period to gradually accept the transformation under the leadership of the state and the working class. In industry, due to the state's control of most industrial raw materials, starting in 1950, we adopted the methods of supplying raw materials, processing orders, and unified procurement and marketing for private industry, thereby initially bringing private industry into the orbit of state capitalism. By 1954, we further planned to use the method of public-private joint operations to transform capitalist industry, making most of the major private industrial enterprises transform into public-private joint enterprises. In commerce, due to the state's control of all important agricultural and industrial products through state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce, it is possible to supply goods to private commerce according to the conditions stipulated by the state, making private commerce perform the business of commission sales. In 1954, this initial form of state capitalist commerce had already developed on a large scale. With these preparations, by the autumn and winter of 1955, the high tide of agricultural cooperation finally cut off the path of capitalist development in rural areas, fundamentally changing the balance of class forces within the country, and the conditions for the public-private joint operation of the entire industry of capitalist industry and commerce were completely mature. This public-private joint operation of the entire industry is the highest form of state capitalism in our country, a decisive step in transforming capitalist ownership into socialist public ownership.

To achieve the goal of socialism through the peaceful transitional method of state capitalism, we adopted the policy of gradual expropriation for the nationalization of private means of production by the bourgeoisie. Before the public-private joint operation of the entire industry, the form of expropriation was the distribution of profits, that is, distributing a certain amount of profit (e.g., one-quarter) to the capitalists according to the surplus of the enterprise; after the public-private joint operation of the entire industry, the form of expropriation was the system of fixed interest, that is, the state, through specialized companies, pays a certain amount of interest to the capitalists over a certain period. In addition, all personnel of the capital side who can work are assigned jobs by relevant state departments, and those who cannot work are also appropriately arranged or given relief, ensuring their livelihood. This is also a necessary method of expropriation. Marx and Lenin have both said that under certain historical conditions, it is permissible for the proletariat to adopt a policy of purchase towards the bourgeoisie, and it is beneficial. This has been proven in our revolutionary practice.

In the process of achieving the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, we combined the transformation of enterprises with the transformation of people. That is, while transforming enterprises, we must pay attention to using educational methods to gradually transform capitalists, making them change from exploiters to self-reliant laborers. Our policy towards the national bourgeoisie is to educate them mainly. The restriction of the capitalist economy and the struggle against the illegal behavior of the bourgeoisie are important practical educations. Several adjustments, comprehensive planning, and full arrangements, making them each have their place, are also important practical educations. Those who take an active attitude in the socialist transformation, we welcome; those who take a skeptical attitude, we educate and express waiting; those who take a resistant attitude, we carry out necessary struggles, but the purpose is still to transform them. This policy of differentiated treatment is also important practical education. In addition, we also adopt methods such as lectures, symposiums, study classes, organizing capitalists and their families to study, and guiding capitalists to conduct criticism and self-criticism within themselves to educate them and solve their ideological problems. The purpose of these educations is to raise their original progressive elements, that is, those who support the socialist transformation, to make the intermediate elements and backward elements gradually change their attitudes to align with the progressive elements, and to split the stubborn elements. In a word, unite the majority, weaken the resistance, and facilitate the socialist transformation.

The policy of utilization, restriction, and transformation of capitalist industry and commerce adopted by the state, as well as each step taken according to this policy, was not decided arbitrarily according to subjective wishes but was determined by studying the actual situation and conditions on all sides and according to the urgent needs of the national economy and the people's livelihood. This policy and these steps not only have the support of the broad masses but also the capitalists cannot find any reasonable grounds to reject or oppose. Now it can be determined that, except for a few stubborn elements who still want to resist, the vast majority of national bourgeoisie can accept the socialist transformation in the economy and gradually transform into genuine laborers.

In the process of socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce, our work is not without flaws and errors, and our policies are not mature from the beginning. In the execution of policies, there have also been local deviations. However, the extremely complex and difficult historical task of changing the private ownership of means of production into socialist public ownership has now been basically completed in our country. The question of who will win between socialism and capitalism in our country has now been solved.

This does not mean that our tasks in socialist transformation have been completely completed. There are still many urgent and major issues before us. What are our future tasks?

In the aspect of agricultural cooperation, we still need to continue to strive to attract the remaining few households that have not joined the cooperative according to the policy of voluntarism and mutual benefit, and lead those primary cooperatives to transform into advanced cooperatives. However, we must adopt an attitude of patient waiting and not allow any coercion. The most urgent problem to be solved at present is to ensure that the approximately 1 million cooperatives that have been established can increase production and increase the income of members as much as possible. Some cooperatives were established relatively hastily and still need to quickly handle many outstanding issues or adjust the existing organizational forms. Most cooperatives still lack experience in leading dozens or hundreds of farmers to engage in collective production. The Party must help the cadres of the cooperatives to quickly gain this experience. Many cooperatives overly emphasize collective interests and collective management, neglecting the personal interests, personal freedom, and family sideline production of members, which is a mistake that must be quickly corrected. To effectively mobilize the production enthusiasm of members, consolidate the organization of cooperatives, we must insist on the principles of thrift and democracy in running cooperatives and continuously strengthen the ideological education of socialism and collectivism for members. The former individual farmers have now become members of cooperatives, which is a great change in the lives of hundreds of millions of farmers. The cadres of cooperatives must fully recognize this change, carefully undertake the important leadership responsibilities entrusted to them by the masses, and wholeheartedly serve the interests of members. They should understand that only when members feel that they are indeed the masters of the cooperative and when the income of members can increase every year, can such a cooperative be consolidated.

In the aspect of the transformation of handicrafts and other original individual economies, we must adopt different forms according to the characteristics of each industry and solve the specific problems of various cooperative organizations in their development. Here, it is wrong to adopt a uniform form regardless of specific conditions. Some cooperative organizations will develop into state-owned enterprises or be merged into state-owned enterprises under appropriate conditions; some cooperative organizations will maintain the collective ownership of means of production for a long period; while other cooperative organizations will maintain the profit-and-loss accounting method of operation under the management of socialist enterprises. All kinds of cooperative organizations must pay attention to maintaining and developing the excellent traditions of the original individual economy in production and operation. After cooperation, the quality of handicraft products must not be reduced but improved, and the variety must not be reduced but increased.

In the aspect of the transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, we should also solve their specific problems in development according to the characteristics of each industry and the multifaceted needs of the social economy, and not handle them lightly in a uniform manner to avoid losses. For the personnel in enterprises, we should continue to carry out systematic education and organizational work, making them fully understand and execute their tasks in enterprise transformation, production, and uniting and educating personnel of the capital side, and select outstanding personnel from among the workers to participate in enterprise management. For the personnel of the capital side, we should arrange their work and life, establish a good relationship of joint work between the public and private sides, and continue to strengthen their political education and that of their families. Many personnel of the capital side are experienced in management and technical knowledge, understand the specific needs of consumers, are familiar with market conditions, and are good at careful calculation. Therefore, in addition to educating them, our staff must seriously learn from them and inherit their beneficial experience and knowledge as a social heritage. The transformation of capitalist industry and commerce has now only reached the stage of public-private joint operation of the entire industry. We must be prepared to transform these enterprises into completely socialist state-owned enterprises at an appropriate time in the future.

Only after completing the above-mentioned tasks in all aspects can we thoroughly solve the problem of socialist transformation in our country. We believe that our Party will definitely continue to work with the people of the whole country to complete these tasks in a short period of time and provide the most favorable conditions for the development of socialist construction in our country.

**(3) The Execution of the First Five-Year Plan for Socialist Construction and the Preparation for the Second Five-Year Plan**

Our country's first Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy has been implemented for three years and eight and a half months. By next year, our country will complete the first Five-Year Plan and compile the second Five-Year Plan from 1958 to 1962. The current central task of our Party and the people of the whole country is to strive to overfulfill the first Five-Year Plan and actively prepare for the second Five-Year Plan.

The execution of the first Five-Year Plan has achieved tremendous success, even our enemies cannot deny this success.

We have vigorously developed the basic construction of industry. In the past few years, we have expanded the Northeastern iron and steel industrial base, started the construction of two new iron and steel industrial bases in Inner Mongolia and Central China, and built and expanded a series of power stations, coal mines, oil wells, a series of non-ferrous metal plants, chemical plants, building material plants, a series of machine manufacturing plants, and a series of light industry plants. The first Five-Year Plan stipulates that 694 industrial construction projects above the specified limit should be constructed, 455 of which should be completed. In fact, the number of projects under construction will reach about 800, and the number of projects that can be completed will be close to 500. Of the total investment in basic construction of 42.7 billion yuan stipulated in the plan for five years, the amount completed in the first three years and the amount planned to be completed this year has reached 35.5 billion yuan, accounting for 83% of the planned amount.

The first Five-Year Plan stipulates that the total industrial output value should increase by 90.3% in five years, and this stipulation will be overfulfilled. The total industrial output value of this year's annual plan has already reached the 1957 target of the original plan, and the planned output of steel, steel products, metal cutting machine tools, cement, automobile tires, cotton yarn, cotton cloth, paper, and other items this year have all exceeded the 1957 target of the original plan. Due to the development of heavy industry, our country has now begun to produce heavy-duty trucks, jet aircraft, 6,000 to 12,000 kilowatt power generation equipment, and so on. By 1957, 60% of the machinery and equipment needed for our country's economic construction will be self-sufficient.

The agriculture of our country, in terms of total output value and major grain crops and economic crops, will also be able to overfulfill the first Five-Year Plan. The total output value of agriculture and sideline production is planned to increase by 23.3% in 1957 compared to 1952. In 1953 and 1954, due to severe natural disasters, the increase was very small, but in 1955, it increased by 14.8% compared to 1952. This year, although our country has suffered relatively severe floods, droughts, and wind disasters, grain production is still expected to reach the 1957 level of the original plan on the basis of cooperation.

In the field of water conservancy, our country has carried out a series of constructions in the Huai River basin, the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, and many other rivers in the past three years. The preparatory work for the construction of the Sanmenxia water conservancy hub on the Yellow River has been completed. In addition, a large number of small-scale water conservancy projects have been built in rural areas across the country.

In the field of transportation, the first Five-Year Plan stipulates the construction of 4,000 kilometers of new railways, which will be overfulfilled this year. The plan stipulates the construction of 10,000 kilometers of new trunk roads, which will also be overfulfilled this year.

In the fields of domestic trade and foreign trade, as well as cultural education and health, there have also been rapid developments.

The living conditions of workers have improved to some extent. It is estimated that this year, the average wage of workers nationwide will increase by 33.5% compared to 1952. The state and enterprises actually spend about 13% of the total wage every year on labor insurance, medical care for workers, education for workers, and welfare for workers, totaling about 4.4 billion yuan in four years. The state has built and plans to build 50 million square meters of workers' dormitories in the past three years and this year.

It should be pointed out that some indicators in the first Five-Year Plan, such as the output of crude oil, edible vegetable oil, and cigarettes, will not be completed due to objective limitations. However, overall, the first Five-Year Plan can be overfulfilled.

The total investment in basic construction and engineering projects of our first Five-Year Plan, although it is possible to overfulfill, some major construction units will still need to concentrate the necessary financial and material resources to complete the predetermined tasks. For other projects above the specified limit, we should also strive to complete the predetermined plan as much as possible.

Each heavy industry department has already overfulfilled the production tasks, but to ensure that the basic construction plan can be better completed, we must strive to produce more steel, machinery and equipment, and building materials, and correspondingly increase the production of coal, electricity, oil, non-ferrous metals, and chemical products, etc. At the same time, we should also correspondingly solve the problems of transportation and urban construction.

In the field of agriculture, we must make serious efforts. Grain and cotton must strive to continue to increase production. Oil crops, pigs, and other livestock, and some sideline products have not increased significantly in the past few years, and some have even declined. We must take effective measures to promote their rapid increase.

After completing the first Five-Year Plan, we will immediately implement the second Five-Year Plan. Therefore, at this Congress, we will discuss and adopt our Party's suggestions on the second Five-Year Plan. Regarding this suggestion, Comrade Zhou Enlai will make a special report on behalf of the Central Committee of the Party.

What is the basic task of the second Five-Year Plan?

The Central Committee of the Party believes that to meet the needs of the expanded reproduction of our socialist society, to complete the task of socialist industrialization, to strengthen international cooperation among socialist countries, and to promote the common prosperity of socialist countries, based on the conditions of our country's large population and rich resources, we should basically build a complete industrial system in the period of three five-year plans. According to this direction, the basic task of the second Five-Year Plan, simply put, is: (1) to continue to carry out industrial construction with heavy industry as the center, promote the technological transformation of the national economy, and establish a solid foundation for the socialist industrialization of our country; (2) to continue to complete the socialist transformation, consolidate and expand collective ownership and public ownership; (3) on the basis of developing basic construction and continuing to complete the socialist transformation, to further develop the production of industry, agriculture, and handicrafts, and correspondingly develop transportation and commerce; (4) to strive to cultivate construction talents, strengthen scientific research work, and adapt to the needs of socialist economic and cultural development; (5) on the basis of the development of industrial and agricultural production, to strengthen national defense, and improve the material and cultural living standards of the people.

During the first Five-Year Plan period, we generally could not produce heavy and precise machinery ourselves, so we could not supply many key projects with the necessary equipment. The steel produced in our country is not only insufficient in quantity but also in variety, and many kinds of high-alloy steel cannot be produced. The products of non-ferrous metal industry are few in variety, and the radio industry is still weak. The organic synthetic chemical industry is almost non-existent. In the second Five-Year Plan, we should strive to build the above-mentioned weak and lacking projects, and strive to make 70% of the machinery and equipment needed for our country's economic construction self-sufficient by 1962, including some heavy and precise machinery. In terms of fuel, the production of oil is particularly lagging behind the needs, and we must gradually improve this situation.

During the second Five-Year Plan period, we need to carry out geological exploration on a larger scale to discover more varieties and quantities of underground resources, and to carry out basic construction on a larger scale. In the second Five-Year Plan, the investment in basic construction will be increased by about one-fold compared to the first Five-Year Plan. In addition to continuing the construction of the iron and steel industrial bases in Northeast China, Central China, and Inner Mongolia, we will build new industrial bases in the Sanmenxia area, Gansu-Qinghai area, Xinjiang area, and Southwest China. After the completion of the basic construction plan of the second Five-Year Plan, many machine manufacturing plants, metallurgical plants, power stations, coal mines, oil enterprises, chemical plants, and building material plants across the country will be equipped with modern advanced technology.

The production of various departments of heavy industry needs to be greatly increased. By 1962, the production of steel is expected to increase from the original planned amount of 412 million tons in 1957 to 1,050 to 1,200 million tons, the production of coal is expected to increase from 1.13 billion tons to 1.9 to 2.1 billion tons, and the production of electricity is expected to increase from 15.9 billion kilowatt-hours to 400 to 430 billion kilowatt-hours.

Light industry also needs to develop at a relatively fast pace. By 1962, it is expected that cotton yarn will increase from the original planned amount of 500 million pieces in 1957 to 800 to 900 million pieces, edible vegetable oil will increase from 179 million tons to 310 to 320 million tons, sugar will increase from 110 million tons to 240 to 250 million tons, and machine-made paper will increase from 65 million tons to 150 to 160 million tons.

To adapt to the needs of the entire national economy, the second Five-Year Plan should, according to the direction indicated in the draft outline of the national agricultural development for 1956 to 1967, raise agriculture to a higher level. By 1962, it is expected to produce 500 billion jin of grain, 480 million dan of cotton, and it is expected to strive to exceed these two indicators. Pig farming is expected to reach 250 million, and soybeans, oil crops, sugar crops, other economic crops, and sideline products must also be actively developed.

Railways, highways, water transportation, and telecommunications must also continue to develop. For the existing lines, necessary technical transformations should be carried out step by step, and transportation should be organized rationally to fully tap the potential of existing transportation equipment. The current railway transportation is already showing signs of tension in some places and must be actively improved. In the second Five-Year Plan, it is expected to build 8,000 to 9,000 kilometers of new railways, extending the Lanxin Railway to the Sino-Soviet border, and connecting the provinces of Northwest and Southwest China with railway trunk lines.

To increase the variety of materials and equipment, we must fully mobilize the technical strength of our country, strive to strengthen the design and research of products, and produce new products. It is wrong to belittle our own technical strength and not actively use and cultivate it.

According to preliminary calculations, it is expected that the national income at the end of the second Five-Year Plan period will increase by about 50% compared to the end of the first Five-Year Plan period. In addition to increasing the state's accumulation, the living standards of the people will be significantly improved. In five years, the number of workers will increase by 6 to 7 million, the average wage of workers will increase by 25% to 30%, and the total income of farmers will also increase by 25% to 30%. The supply of grain, cotton cloth, and other important consumer goods such as edible oil, sugar, kerosene, and coal will also increase.

From the above simple outline, it can be seen that the Party's suggestion on the second Five-Year Plan heralds the great and rapid progress of our national economy. According to this suggestion, the realization of the second Five-Year Plan will prepare the necessary conditions for our country to basically complete the general tasks of the transition period in the third Five-Year Plan period.

The development speed proposed by the Central Committee of the Party for the second Five-Year Plan is active and at the same time reliable. The development speed must be active to avoid missing opportunities and falling into conservatism; it must also be reliable to avoid deviating from the correct proportion of economic development, making the people's burden too heavy, or causing different departments to be disconnected, making the plan unfulfilled, and causing unnecessary waste, which is adventurism.

It is clear that the second Five-Year Plan requires greater investment than the first Five-Year Plan. Our national economy has developed, and our financial situation has also improved. However, it must be seen that our funds are still limited, and we must use the funds most effectively and economically. An important method to increase construction costs is to further reduce military and political expenses. The Central Committee of the Party has already determined this policy in 1950, but due to the outbreak of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, this policy could not be implemented early. Although our country has made efforts to reduce military and political expenses in recent years, in the first Five-Year Plan, it is estimated that defense expenses and administrative expenses will still account for 32% of the state's financial expenditure, and economic and cultural construction expenditure will account for about 56%. In the second Five-Year Plan, the proportion of military and political expenses must be reduced to about 20%, and the proportion of economic and cultural construction expenditure must be increased to 60% to 70%. In economic and cultural construction, resources must also be concentrated appropriately. Therefore, the technological transformation of the national economy must be concentrated in heavy industry, especially in machinery manufacturing and metallurgy, in the second Five-Year Plan. At the same time, in all enterprises, in all state organs, and in the entire social life, we must continue to advocate thrift and overcome waste. Waste at any time hinders the development of production and the improvement of living standards. Our construction is just beginning, and we should strive even more to accumulate every yuan of construction funds and use them most effectively. Some of our consumer goods must be exported to exchange for the machinery and equipment needed for industrial construction. For future happiness, we must temporarily endure some difficulties in life. Thrift in national construction, thrift in enterprise management, thrift in cooperative management, and thrift in all undertakings are the long-term policies of our Party in building socialism, and they are also the policies that must be followed in formulating and implementing the second Five-Year Plan.

Below, we will briefly discuss some of the experiences we have gained in the past few years in the fields of industry, agriculture, commerce, and culture and education.

**Industry**

In the field of industry, here we will only discuss a few relatively important issues, namely the relationship between heavy industry and light industry, the layout of industry, the quality of products and projects, the living conditions of workers, and the leadership of enterprises.

The industrialization of our country is based on the development of the production of heavy industry, that is, the production of means of production. In old China, the proportion of the output value of the means of production industry in the total industrial output value was very low, accounting for only 26.6% in 1949. This is a sign of the backwardness of China's productive forces. The socialist industrialization policy implemented by our Party requires fundamentally changing this situation and ensuring the priority development of the production of means of production. In 1952, the output value of the means of production industry accounted for approximately 35.6% of the total industrial output value of our country, and by the end of the first Five-Year Plan period, this proportion may rise to over 40%.

To develop the national economy in a planned manner, we must continue to implement the policy of prioritizing the development of heavy industry in the future. Some comrades want to reduce the speed of developing heavy industry, which is a wrong idea. Let us ask: if we do not quickly establish our necessary machinery manufacturing industry, metallurgical industry, and other related heavy industries, what will we use to equip light industry, transportation, construction, and agriculture? We will not be able to obtain the necessary machinery, steel, and cement, electricity, and fuel. Our national economy will remain in a backward state for a long time. It is clear that we cannot do this.

However, there are also comrades who emphasize the significance of developing heavy industry one-sidedly. They want to reduce the speed of developing light industry and other economic sectors, which is also a wrong idea. They do not understand: first, the demand for consumer goods by the people is increasing day by day. If light industry is not developed accordingly, there may be a shortage of goods, which will affect the stability of prices and the market. Especially in rural areas, if there are not enough industrial products to exchange for agricultural products at stable and reasonable prices, it may hinder the consolidation of the worker-peasant alliance and may also affect the development of agricultural production. Second, light industry requires less investment, the construction period of enterprises is shorter, and the turnover of funds is faster, so the accumulation of funds is also faster, and the funds accumulated by light industry can also be used to help the development of heavy industry. It can be seen that, within the range allowed by funds, raw materials, and the market, appropriately paying attention to the development of light industry is not only harmless but also beneficial to the construction of heavy industry.

In the layout of industry, the current need is to coordinate the coastal and inland areas, large enterprises and medium and small enterprises, and central state-owned enterprises and local state-owned enterprises.

To reasonably allocate productive forces, make industrial enterprises close to natural resources, and make industry and the entire national economy develop in a balanced manner, our country has gradually moved the industrial focus to the inland during the first Five-Year Plan period, changing the abnormal phenomenon before liberation where more than 70% of industry was concentrated in the coastal provinces. However, this does not mean that we can deny or ignore the role of industry in the coastal provinces. We should make full use of the favorable conditions of the coastal provinces, continue to develop industry there appropriately, to help the development of inland industry, and accelerate national industrialization. During the first Five-Year Plan period, industrial areas such as Liaoning, Shanghai, and Tianjin have played a significant role. In the second Five-Year Plan, in addition to making full use of the industrial bases in Northeast China and East China, we must also reasonably play the role of Hebei, Shandong, and South China in the development of industry.

In the second Five-Year Plan, to coordinate the construction and production of large enterprises, to accelerate the development of industry, to strengthen industrial cooperation, to increase the variety of products, and to make full use of resources and existing enterprises, especially a large number of public-private joint enterprises, we must build and renovate medium and small enterprises in a planned manner while building large enterprises.

We must correctly combine the enthusiasm of the various economic departments under the Central Committee with the enthusiasm of local economic organizations. In the past, on the one hand, some central departments did not pay enough attention to the development and unified arrangement of local industry, resulting in local industry not being able to reasonably tap its potential; on the other hand, some local leadership organs also blindly built and expanded some industries without considering whether the national production equipment was sufficient and without considering the local resource conditions and other economic conditions, thus also causing losses to the state. These two tendencies must be corrected.

To complete the state's production plan, whether it is light industry or heavy industry, whether it is local state-owned enterprises or central state-owned enterprises, we must strive to improve the quality of products. Similarly, to complete the state's construction plan, the quality of projects in industry, transportation, and other departments must also be improved. This is one of the most urgent issues in our socialist construction.

The superiority of socialism is not only reflected in the quantity and progress of our economic achievements but also in its quality. We have already produced many high-quality heavy industrial products and light industrial products and built many high-quality projects. However, due to the backward equipment and low technical level of some enterprises, the lack of product standards and process regulations in some enterprises, the lack of strict quality inspection and technical supervision systems in some enterprises, and especially the lack of sufficient attention to ensuring the quality of products and projects by some enterprise leadership organs, which only emphasize ensuring quantity and progress, many products and projects have poor quality, and some products do not meet the specifications and become substandard goods. The negative effects and shortcomings of the unified procurement and marketing system in the commercial sector, as well as some chaotic phenomena that occurred in the transformation of private industry and commerce, have also reduced the sense of responsibility for product quality in many light industrial enterprises and even caused many products to have serious quality degradation. These situations have already caused losses to the state and the people and must be quickly reversed. All enterprises with low technical level and backward equipment must take effective measures to quickly master the relevant technology and gradually improve the situation of backward equipment. All enterprises must establish reasonable product standards and process regulations. All factories and construction sites with loose inspection systems must quickly establish quality inspection and technical supervision institutions and systems. Appropriate treatment methods should be established for products that do not meet the standards and projects that do not meet the specifications, and the quality and supply of raw materials should be actively improved. For light industrial products, the policy of grading and pricing according to quality should be strictly implemented, and the selection and purchase system should be gradually promoted in some products. Most importantly, we must conduct ideological education on ensuring and improving quality among all relevant workers and staff, and thoroughly correct the erroneous views that are not responsible for quality.

On the basis of developing production, gradually improving the living conditions of workers has a significant role in mobilizing the enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers. To improve the living conditions of workers, what problems need to be solved? First, we must ensure that the wage income of workers gradually increases on the basis of production development and continue to implement the principle of distribution according to work, improve the wage system and reward system. Second, we must strengthen the safety measures for production and labor protection work. Third, we must ensure and improve the supply of subsidiary food. Fourth, we must gradually increase the welfare facilities for workers and actively find ways to solve the urgent needs of workers for housing and other difficulties. Fifth, we must ensure that workers have time to take care of their family life and get the rest they deserve.

Many difficulties faced by the masses of workers cannot be solved in a short time and can only be solved after the development of socialist construction. We still need to work hard and should not only care about personal interests and current interests but also neglect the interests of the whole country and the long-term interests. This must be explained to the masses of workers. However, on the other hand, emphasizing the interests of the whole country and the long-term interests while neglecting the personal interests and current interests of workers is also wrong. Some problems in the current living conditions of workers must be solved and can be solved, but they have not been solved simply because the leaders of enterprises, trade unions, and relevant departments have not made active efforts. We must resolutely oppose this bureaucratic attitude that does not care about the concerns of the masses.

The above principles for handling the living conditions of workers apply to all workers in enterprises and civil servants in state organs.

The enthusiasm of the masses of workers can be mobilized to a great extent, which depends on whether the leadership system and leadership work of enterprises are sound. What should the sound leadership of enterprises be?

In enterprises, we should establish a leadership system that combines collective leadership with individual responsibility with the Party as the core. All major issues should be discussed and decided collectively, and all daily work should be divided among specialists to be responsible for. The leaders of enterprises, the Party organizations, administrative organizations, trade union organizations, and Youth League organizations in enterprises should all be good at explaining the current tasks of the enterprise to the masses, good at mobilizing the masses to carry out socialist competitions and advanced producer movements, and propose rationalization suggestions, continuously improve work. The leading cadres in all aspects of the enterprise should all be good at going deep into the masses, blending with the masses, understanding the emotions and demands of the masses, and actively helping the masses to solve difficulties.

The improvement of enterprise leadership work not only requires the efforts of the enterprises themselves but also requires the efforts of higher state organs. Here, it is necessary to point out such a fact: that is, higher state organs often interfere too much and too rigidly with enterprises, hindering the initiative and flexibility that enterprises should have, causing unnecessary losses to work. We should ensure that enterprises have appropriate self-government rights in national unified leadership and unified planning, in plan management, financial management, cadre management, worker allocation, and welfare facilities, etc. This is not to say that the leadership of higher state organs needs to be weakened. On the contrary, many higher organs have not truly gone deep into enterprises, and their leadership of enterprises is often untimely and not specific. Our economic departments' leadership organs must seriously manage the things that should be managed and not go to manage the things that can be left alone or should not be managed. Only when the strong leadership of higher state organs is combined with the initiative of enterprises themselves can we quickly promote our cause.

**Agriculture**

The suggestion for the second Five-Year Plan proposes huge tasks in the growth of agricultural production and the increase of farmers' income. How should we complete these tasks?

We have achieved agricultural cooperation under the condition of no agricultural machinery. The agriculture of our country can only gradually realize mechanization according to the different cultivation conditions of different regions, along with the industrialization of the state. By the end of the second Five-Year Plan period, the area of mechanized farming is expected to account for only one-tenth of the total cultivated land area in the country. The increased cultivated land area, like the first Five-Year Plan, can only reach tens of millions of mu, which is close to one-twentieth of the original cultivated land area in the country. The production of chemical fertilizers, by 1962, will still be less than three jin per mu of sown area on average. Therefore, in the second Five-Year Plan, the main method for increasing agricultural production is still to rely on agricultural cooperatives and farmers to adopt measures such as water conservancy construction, increased fertilization, soil improvement, variety improvement, promotion of new agricultural tools, increase of multiple cropping index, improvement of cultivation methods, and prevention and treatment of pest and disease disasters to increase the yield per unit area.

It should be seen that relying on these measures, the potential for achieving agricultural increase is enormous. For example, in the field of water conservancy, the current irrigated area accounts for only one-third of the total cultivated land area in the country, and in the remaining two-thirds of the cultivated land, there are many places where water sources can be found for irrigation. In the field of fertilizers, natural fertilizers such as human and animal manure and green manure are abundant and have high efficiency, and there are still many places that have not fully utilized these fertilizer sources. Our rural areas have abundant labor, and they have been organized on the basis of agricultural cooperation. As long as the above measures are correctly and persistently promoted, it is completely possible to achieve the increase targets of the second Five-Year Plan suggested.

In the second Five-Year Plan, ensuring the increase of grain and cotton is still a very important task. At the same time, ensuring the increase of other economic crops, animal husbandry, and sideline products is also an important task. According to statistics, excluding self-sufficient sideline production, the output value of various economic crops, livestock products, and sideline products accounts for about 50% of the total agricultural output value in the country, which is close to or even exceeds the proportion of grain, and is therefore of great importance to farmers' income. These economic crops, livestock products, and sideline products are also of great significance to the supply of light industry, people's sideline food, and export trade. Taking pig farming as an example, we require the number of pigs in the second Five-Year Plan to increase from the planned number of 1.38 billion in 1957 to about 2.5 billion in 1962, because pig farming is related to the meat supply of cities and rural areas, the fertilizer for crops, and the export of pork and bristles, and it must be vigorously developed. Therefore, the Party organizations, governments, and their agricultural departments in various places must strengthen the leadership of economic crops, animal husbandry, and sideline production. According to the needs of the locality and the country, under the guidance of the central and local plans, they should help each agricultural producers' cooperative to formulate a comprehensive plan for the development of grain production, economic crop production, animal husbandry production, and sideline production that suits their own situation. In the development of sideline production, it is necessary to consider the necessary division of labor between the collective operation of the cooperative and the family operation of members, so that the enthusiasm of both sides can be reasonably mobilized. At present, many cooperatives pay little attention to or even unreasonably restrict members' family sideline operations, and this tendency should be corrected.

To promote the development of economic crops, animal husbandry, and sideline production, it is necessary to implement a correct price policy. Since the founding of the People's Republic, our price policy has generally been appropriate and has taken into account the interests of farmers, but there have also been some errors in its implementation. In recent years, the development of some economic crops, pig farming, and other sideline production has been slow or reduced, partly because the purchase prices of these products are somewhat low. These low purchase prices should be appropriately adjusted after investigation and research.

An important issue in ensuring the development of agricultural production is to ensure that farmers can increase their income under the condition of production development. The Central Committee of the Party requires that all cooperatives in the country strive to increase the income of 90% of members in the first few years of establishment, and in normal years, and that in the future, on the basis of production development, the income of general members can increase year by year. For this, not only does the state need a correct tax policy and price policy, but the cooperative also needs to correctly determine the proportion of public accumulation and members' personal income. The cooperative should not arbitrarily increase the amount of production expenses, management expenses, public accumulation funds, and public welfare funds; the state's taxation should also be maintained at an appropriate proportion. We should insist on the policy of distributing national interests, collective interests, and personal interests.

**Commerce**

In line with the development of industry and agriculture, domestic trade and foreign trade have achieved remarkable achievements in the first Five-Year Plan period. In the field of domestic trade, the total retail sales of social commodities are expected to increase by 66.3% compared to 1952 according to this year's plan. In the past few years, we have maintained price stability, developed the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, and met the needs of the people. In the field of foreign trade, the total import and export value this year will increase by 65% compared to 1952. Before national liberation, the imported commodities of our country were mainly living materials; since 1950, production materials have accounted for more than 90% of the imported commodities. Our foreign trade has guaranteed the needs of production materials and equipment for the construction of the state and has developed economic cooperation and friendly relations with the Soviet Union, various people's democratic countries, and other countries.

During the second Five-Year Plan period, based on the further development of the national economy, according to preliminary estimates, the total retail sales of social commodities in 1962 will increase by about 50% compared to 1957, and the total import and export value of foreign trade will also increase significantly.

Due to the basic completion of the socialist transformation of private commerce, a unified socialist market has been formed, and socialist commerce now plays an extremely important role in the entire national economy. Consumer goods and part of the production materials in industrial products, and the commodity part of agricultural products, all need to be distributed to industrial production departments, agricultural producers' cooperatives, and the broad masses of consumers through socialist commerce. Due to the increase in people's purchasing power, the increase in people's demand for consumer goods, especially sideline food, the rapid development of agricultural cooperation and industrial construction, and the increasing demand for export materials in foreign trade, the tasks of our commercial work will be even more arduous in the future. The commercial sector must, according to the needs of the masses and foreign exports, use price policies and procurement measures to promote industry and agriculture to increase production and improve quality; must further develop the commercial network, expand the circulation of goods, strengthen the procurement and supply of industrial products and agricultural products, and make the arrangement of the commercial network adapt to the needs of commodity procurement and the convenience of the masses' purchases.

The further development of commerce, especially the need to seriously improve the purchase and sales relationship at present, correctly grasp the price policy, and appropriately adjust the prices of some commodities.

In the period of utilizing, restricting, and transforming capitalist enterprises, many measures taken regarding the purchase and sales relationship must now be changed and replaced with measures that suit the current economic situation. Before the implementation of the public-private joint operation of the entire industry of capitalist industry and commerce, our state-owned commerce had implemented processing orders and unified procurement and marketing for the products of capitalist industry; for agricultural products, except for grain, cotton, and oil crops, which were unified by the state, most of the rest were either entrusted to the supply and marketing cooperatives for unified purchase or directly purchased by state-owned commerce; for the markets in cities and towns, strict management was implemented, unified commodity prices were agreed upon, and the scope of activities of some private merchants was restricted. These measures were necessary at that time and achieved results. However, the implementation of these measures also produced some negative effects, which is the previous mention of the reduction in quality and variety of some industrial products, the reduction in production of some agricultural products and sideline products, and the obstruction of some material exchanges. Now these shortcomings must be overcome. We should improve the current market management methods, cancel overly strict and rigid restrictions; and we should, within the scope of a unified socialist market, allow the existence and certain development of a free market under state leadership to a certain extent, as a supplement to the state market.

Before national liberation, our country experienced twelve years of severe inflation, and prices often fluctuated. After liberation, in response to this situation, the basic policy of the Party was to stabilize prices. That is to say, regardless of whether some prices were reasonable at that time, first stabilize the prices of various commodities at their current levels, and then, after stabilization, make some adjustments to some particularly unreasonable prices. The Party's basic policy is correct, and the execution of this policy has been successful, which has played a beneficial role in promoting the development of industrial and agricultural production in our country. However, we have also made many errors and shortcomings in the execution of price policy. The commercial sector should summarize the past experiences and, under the continued implementation of the policy of stabilizing prices, formulate a relatively complete price policy and price plan that suits the current specific situation and is beneficial to industrial and agricultural production. The regulation of purchase prices must achieve the goal of promoting increased production, which is an important principle of our price policy. To improve the quality of industrial and agricultural products, both purchase and sales must implement the policy of grading and pricing according to quality. For commodities with large price differences between local purchase and local sales, the price difference should be appropriately narrowed; while for low-value small commodities, the price difference between wholesale and retail should be appropriately widened. In addition, it is necessary to strictly prohibit behaviors that violate the state's price policy and seek improper commercial profits.

The enormous tasks of commerce require the commercial workers of the whole country to further learn to do business. We must seriously summarize all the useful experiences accumulated by our commerce, must train commercial workers and experts in a planned manner, and raise our socialist commerce to a higher level.

**Culture and Education**

The field of culture and education occupies an important position in the entire socialist construction. Our country's cultural and educational undertakings have made tremendous progress in the past few years. Compared to 1949, the number of students in institutions of higher learning has increased from 116,000 to 380,000, the number of students in secondary schools has increased from 1,268,800 to 5,860,000, and the number of primary school students has increased from 24,390,000 to 57,700,000. The number of books published has increased from over 100 million copies in the early days of liberation to 1.6 billion copies this year. The number of beds in medical institutions has increased from 106,000 in the early days of liberation to 339,000 this year.

Title: The Second Five-Year Plan and the General Line for Socialist Construction
Author:
Date: 1956-09-28
Page: 1

The second five-year plan requires an increase of about one-third in the number of students in institutions of higher learning, and a corresponding increase in the number of students in secondary specialized schools, senior high schools, and junior high schools. The second five-year plan also requires a special emphasis on the training of specialized personnel and the development of scientific research to actively grasp the latest scientific achievements of all countries. Our scientists have already drafted a preliminary plan for scientific development from 1956 to 1967. This plan requires that some of China's scientific and technological departments, which are crucial to the national economy, should approach the world's advanced level within approximately twelve years. We must resolutely support all scientific research institutions and institutions of higher learning to work together to achieve this goal.

To flourish China's science and art and make them serve socialist construction, the Central Committee of the Party has put forward the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend." Truth in science is made clearer through debate, and artistic styles must be inclusive. The Party should not rely on administrative orders to implement its leadership in academic and artistic matters but should advocate free discussion and free competition to promote the development of science and art. To achieve China's cultural revolution, we must make great efforts to gradually eliminate illiteracy and, within the scope of financial capacity, gradually expand primary education to achieve compulsory primary education in stages and regions within twelve years. At the same time, cultural and technical education for workers and a portion of low-cultured officials must be continuously strengthened. For ethnic minorities without a written language, we should help them create one.

We must arm intellectuals and the masses with socialist and Marxist-Leninist thought, and criticize feudal and capitalist thought. In the past few years, we have done a lot of work in this regard, which has played a great role in the victory of China's socialist transformation. However, everyone knows that transforming old ideology is more difficult than transforming old production relations and requires more time. We must continue to strengthen ideological work. When we criticize the feudal and capitalist ideological systems, we must carefully inherit the beneficial cultural heritage of the old times for the people.

To complete the tasks of cultural education in all aspects, we must further expand and strengthen the ranks of intellectuals. We must, through school education and in-service training of cadres, cultivate a large number of new intellectuals, especially those from the working class. At the same time, we must utilize the strength of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois intellectuals to build socialism and learn from them. However, we should not allow the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideology they bring to infiltrate the proletarian ranks. Instead, we must do our utmost to help them transform into new intellectuals closely linked with the laboring people. Due to the long-term and systematic work done by our Party, the basic ranks of China's intellectuals have already formed a close alliance with workers and peasants, and a considerable number of intellectuals have become communists and joined our Party. In the future, our task is to continue to implement the policy of uniting, educating, and transforming intellectuals, improve the use of intellectuals, and make them serve the great cause of building our country more effectively.

The fundamental issue of revolution is the issue of power. Why have we been able to fundamentally change the face of our motherland in just seven years and achieve such great successes in socialist transformation and socialist construction? Is this not because we have led the working class and the broad masses of the people to seize national power? Is this not because our power is a completely new type of power—the power of people's democratic dictatorship?

To greatly develop China's already begun socialist construction and thoroughly complete socialist transformation, we must continue to strengthen people's democratic dictatorship and continue to improve state work.

The state we have established, like all other socialist states, is the most democratic, most efficient, and most solid state in human history. The founding of the People's Republic of China has elevated several hundred million oppressed and humiliated people from slaves to masters, ensuring their lives and freedom, honoring labor, and granting women equal status. A large number of outstanding workers, peasants, women, and youth have participated in state administration, building our state organs into diligent, clean, and people-serving state organs. Our country has achieved unprecedented unity. Due to the thorough completion of democratic reforms and the victory over counter-revolutionaries, due to the achievements of socialist transformation and the development of socialist construction, and due to other series of measures taken by the people's government, unprecedented stability has emerged in our society.

All states in the world are essentially class dictatorships, the question being which class dictates which class. All landlord and bourgeois states are states where a minority rules the majority, where exploiters rule the laboring people. The great achievement of the October Revolution was that it first reversed this situation, making the state a tool for the majority to rule the minority, for the laboring people to rule the exploiters. Although our revolution has its own characteristics, Chinese communists regard their cause as a continuation of the great October Revolution. Our people's democratic dictatorship is the dictatorship of the people, led by the working class, over the reactionary classes, reactionaries, and those who resist the socialist revolution. Our democracy is not the democracy of a minority but the democracy of the vast majority, the democracy of workers, peasants, and all other laboring people, as well as all those who support socialism and patriotism.

China's people's democratic dictatorship has gone through two periods: the period of the bourgeois democratic revolution and the period of the socialist revolution. Before the victory of the bourgeois democratic revolution nationwide, people's democratic dictatorship had already been established in the revolutionary base areas. This dictatorship was to solve the tasks of the bourgeois democratic revolution because it only implemented changes to the feudal land system, did not change the private ownership of production materials by the national bourgeoisie, and did not change the individual ownership of peasants. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, people's democratic dictatorship began to undertake the task of transitioning from capitalism to socialism, that is, to change the private ownership of production materials by the bourgeoisie and petty producers into socialist public ownership, and to thoroughly eliminate the system of man exploiting man. Such power can only be proletarian dictatorship. Only the proletariat, through its vanguard, the Communist Party of China, can use the weapon of power without obstruction, unite all laboring people and other forces that can accept socialism closely around itself, and jointly implement the policies and lines of the proletariat. On the one hand, it organizes the transition of economic and cultural life to socialism, and on the other hand, it suppresses the resistance of the reactionary classes and reactionaries and defends against the interference of foreign imperialism, thus being able to accomplish such a serious and complex task.

It is clear: if, in the stage of the bourgeois democratic revolution, China's peasants and national bourgeoisie had not followed the leadership of the proletariat, they would not have been able to achieve victory. Then, in the stage of the socialist revolution, apart from the proletariat, what other social force could take on such a leadership responsibility? If there were no firm, far-sighted, and selfless leadership of the proletariat, even the impoverished peasants would not be able to walk the true path of socialism, let alone the bourgeoisie, whose nature is completely opposite to socialism. The fact that China's bourgeoisie has enthusiastically accepted socialist transformation is a miracle that shows the great power of the correct leadership of the proletariat and the absolute necessity of proletarian dictatorship.

People may ask: since the people's democratic dictatorship in China's current stage is essentially a form of proletarian dictatorship, why do other classes, other parties, and non-party democrats participate in the government? Why does China's people's democratic united front still need to continue to exist?

It must be known: proletarian dictatorship not only needs the firm leadership of the proletariat over state organs but also needs the active participation of the broad masses of the people in state organs. Both are indispensable. The proletariat can only form the dictatorship of the majority over the reactionary classes by uniting with the broad masses that can accept socialism, thus realizing socialism. This is not a very clear principle? Lenin said: "Proletarian dictatorship is the alliance of the proletariat, that is, the vanguard of the laborers, with the numerous non-proletarian laboring classes (petty bourgeoisie, small proprietors, peasants, intelligentsia, etc.), or with the majority of laborers, ... an alliance for the final construction and consolidation of socialism." The range of the class alliance mentioned by Lenin can be different under different historical conditions, but it is undeniable that proletarian dictatorship is always a certain form of class alliance.

The worker-peasant alliance is the foundation of our people's democratic dictatorship and people's democratic united front. Peasants make up more than 80% of China's population. Without the alliance with peasants, it is impossible to realize socialism. Our Party has established a close bond with peasants through long-term revolutionary struggles. Since the founding of the People's Republic, in land reform, mutual aid and cooperation, leadership in agricultural production and rural economic and cultural undertakings, in the formulation and implementation of tax policies, grain policies, and price policies, we have paid attention to continuing to strengthen this bond. Peasants occupy an important position in China's political life. In the state organs of vast rural areas across the country, almost all are peasants. However, it must be said that there are still many shortcomings in our work in not paying enough attention to the specific interests of peasants. After the agricultural cooperativization, the worker-peasant alliance has entered a new, higher stage. However, at the same time, many Party organizations and state organs, due to overestimating the current economic capabilities of agricultural cooperatives and abusing the convenience brought by cooperativization, have seen a new development of commandism tendencies in rural work. To continue to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, we must resolutely overcome these shortcomings.

The policy towards peasants is also applicable to other individuals who have recently joined various cooperative organizations, such as handicraftsmen, small traders, and other individual laborers. They are also an important social stratum in China. Due to their scattered residences and economic activities, our work among them has been relatively weak in the past. Now they have organized, and they need to solve many urgent problems. We must take effective measures to strengthen our ties with them, making their economic and political interests receive due attention.

In China's people's democratic dictatorship and people's democratic united front, the national bourgeoisie occupies a special position. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the government organs in the revolutionary base areas had already absorbed some representatives of the national bourgeoisie. However, this was in the stage of the bourgeois democratic revolution, so it was relatively easy to understand. After the founding of the People's Republic, more representatives of the national bourgeoisie and their parties have participated in China's state organs of proletarian dictatorship nature and continued to maintain political alliances with the working class and the Communist Party in the cause of socialism. Why is this? What is the significance of this alliance in today's socialist transformation, which has already achieved basic victory? Isn't this a burden?

Indeed, China's national bourgeoisie, including large, medium, and small capitalists and bourgeois intellectuals, is the class with the smallest number of people in China, apart from the bureaucratic bourgeoisie, and has great weakness in politics and economics. However, whether in the past or now, this class has had a great influence and role in Chinese society. This is because they developed modern industry in history, led the old democratic revolution, participated to a certain extent in the new democratic revolution, and after the founding of the People's Republic of China, expressed their willingness to accept the leadership of the working class and the Communist Party and gradually accepted socialist transformation. This is because they were among the first to master modern culture and also mastered some modern enterprise technology and management knowledge; until now, they are still a class in China with relatively rich modern cultural knowledge, possessing a relatively large number of intellectuals and experts. In the past few years, the national bourgeoisie has participated in the recovery of the national economy and has participated in or supported the land reform, suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and the struggle to aid Korea and resist America. This has greatly isolated the enemy and strengthened the revolutionary forces. In the process of socialist transformation, the alliance between the working class and the national bourgeoisie has played an active role in educating and transforming bourgeois elements; in the future, we can continue to carry out the work of uniting, educating, and transforming them through this alliance, making them use their knowledge to serve socialist construction. It can be seen that viewing this alliance as a mere burden is wrong.

Most of the national bourgeoisie have undergone profound changes in socialist transformation in recent years. Our task is to continue and improve cooperation with them, giving them ample opportunities to display their abilities and expertise, and to carry out further self-transformation. As in the past, this cooperation will still be one of unity and struggle. In the period before the completion of socialist transformation, class struggle will continue to exist. After the completion of socialist transformation, the struggle between socialist and capitalist positions, viewpoints, and methods will continue for a long time. The main method of our struggle is the method of persuasion and education. Only for those who adopt a hostile attitude towards socialism and violate state laws, necessary coercive transformation methods should be taken according to the situation.

China's democratic parties were mainly formed during the War of Resistance Against Japan and have had a cooperative relationship with our Party since then. They participated in the people's government at the founding of the People's Republic of China and gradually supported the cause of socialism. In the future, we believe that we should adopt the policy of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision between the Communist Party and various democratic parties. The social base of China's various democratic parties is the national bourgeoisie, the upper petty bourgeoisie, and their intellectuals. After the completion of socialist transformation, members of the national bourgeoisie and the upper petty bourgeoisie will become part of the socialist laborers. Various democratic parties will become the parties of this part of the laborers. Since there will still be a long residue of bourgeois ideology in this part of the laborers, various democratic parties will need to continue to link with them, represent them, and help them transform for a long time. At the same time, various democratic parties coexisting with the Communist Party for a long time can also play a role in mutual supervision among the parties. Our Party is a party that serves the people wholeheartedly and does not seek personal gain. However, we still have shortcomings and will definitely have shortcomings in the future and cannot avoid making mistakes. We must first strengthen self-criticism within the Party and rely on the supervision of the broad masses of laborers to eliminate these shortcomings and mistakes; at the same time, we should also be good at obtaining help from the supervision and criticism of various democratic parties and non-party democrats.

Representatives of various democratic parties and non-party democrats hold important positions in many of our state organs. In our government organs, schools, enterprises, and armed forces, there are also many non-Party workers. This requires our Party members to establish good cooperative working relationships with non-Party workers. This issue must be raised because even now, some Communist Party members hold a "pure" view, unwilling to have non-Party members participate in the work of state organs or not consult with non-Party members on matters, and do not respect the authority of non-Party members. This view is a sectarian view. Communist Party members are always a minority among the people, so Communist Party members must always cooperate with non-Party members at any time. The Party must educate those Party members who are not good at cooperating with non-Party members to quickly overcome their shortcomings. This is an important task for consolidating the people's democratic united front at present.

As China's socialist cause develops successfully, the scope of our people's democratic united front will become increasingly broad. We should continue to firmly maintain unity with the upper-class people of ethnic minorities, patriotic figures in religious circles, and other influential patriotic figures. Overseas Chinese in various places are also part of the united front. We must continue to unite them. In short, our task is to mobilize all positive factors and make them contribute to the cause of building socialism.

Thus, the most extensive united front and the most extensive patriotic unity not only do not harm our proletarian dictatorship but are beneficial to the consolidation and development of proletarian dictatorship.

Our state system is a high degree of democracy and a high degree of centralization. This system has shown its superiority in China's history over the past few years. Of course, this does not mean that our state work is already completely sound. Many of our state organs and workers often deviate from the correct principles of our state system in their work, not only failing to but also hindering the vitality of our state system. Of course, it also does not mean that our state system is already perfect in every way. It still needs a considerable amount of time to gradually mature and perfect itself.

What is the main task of improving state work at present?

To adapt to the new situation of socialist transformation and socialist construction, an important task in state work at present is to further expand democratic life and launch a struggle against bureaucratism.

In many of our state organs, there are phenomena of bureaucratism, such as being high above, not understanding the opinions of subordinates and the masses, suppressing the opinions of subordinates and the masses, and being indifferent to the lives of the masses. This bureaucratism, which is detached from the masses and reality, seriously hinders the development of democratic life in the state, hinders the full play of the initiative of the broad masses, and hinders the progress of the socialist cause. We must seriously and systematically improve state organs, streamline their organizational structures, clearly define the responsibilities of each worker, help them change the style of only attending meetings and signing documents without approaching the masses and studying situations and policies, and formulate specific measures for the heads of central-level and provincial/municipal-level state organs to regularly go to the lower levels, understand the situation, inspect work, listen to opinions, and supervise them to strictly implement these measures.

The struggle against bureaucratism is a long-term struggle. However, we are fully confident that we can gradually eliminate the harm of bureaucratism under our people's democratic system. Because our state, unlike the states where a minority oppresses the vast majority of the exploiting classes, is a state that opposes bureaucratism rather than protects it. To effectively struggle against bureaucratism, we must simultaneously strengthen supervision over state work from several aspects. First, we must strengthen the Party's leadership and supervision over state organs. In addition to the Party's committees at all levels regularly inspecting the work of Party organizations in governments at all levels, the working departments of Party committees should be responsible for establishing regular supervision over Party organizations and Party members in relevant government working departments. Second, we must strengthen the supervision of the National People's Congress and its Standing Committee over central-level government organs and the supervision of local people's congresses at all levels over local government organs at all levels. For this purpose, we should strengthen the inspection work of people's representatives to widely collect the opinions of the masses and strengthen the inspection, criticism, and discussion of government work by people's congresses at all levels. Third, we must strengthen the supervision of government organs from top to bottom and from bottom to top. In the struggle against bureaucratism, the state's supervisory organs should fully play their due role. Fourth, we must strengthen the supervision of the masses and lower-level workers in the organs over state organs. We must encourage and support criticism and exposure from the bottom up; those who suppress or retaliate against critics must be given appropriate punishment.

Another important issue in state work at present is that we must appropriately adjust the administrative management powers of the central and local governments. This is also in line with the requirements of expanding democratic life and overcoming bureaucratism.

After the founding of the People's Republic of China, to achieve and consolidate national unity, we opposed decentralization and concentrated many matters that should be managed by the central government into the hands of the central government, which was completely necessary. However, in recent years, some central departments have taken too many matters into their own hands, restricted the local governments too much and too rigidly, and did not consult with the local governments on matters that should be consulted with the local governments; some departments also issued many formalistic documents and forms, putting great pressure on the local governments. This not only harms the work of the local governments but also diverts the energy of the central government and develops bureaucratism. It is impossible to imagine that in our country, the central government can take over all the affairs of the state and do everything well. It is completely necessary to delegate some administrative management powers to the local governments. Many of the state's work, such as agriculture, small and medium-sized industries, local transportation, local commerce, primary and secondary education, local health care, and local finance, should only be proposed by the central government with general policies and plans, and the specific work should be delegated to the local governments to deploy and handle according to local conditions and time, and some of the central government's cadres should also be sent to work in the local governments. Provinces, municipalities, counties, and townships should all have a certain range of administrative management powers. Based on this policy, the central government is currently working with local governments to study and draft specific plans and prepare to gradually implement them. In this way, both the central government organs and the local governments can be active, and both the central and local governments can have the necessary flexibility, while also implementing mutual supervision. This is of great significance for promoting the universal upsurge of China's socialist construction.

Properly handling the issue of ethnic minorities is a major task in our state work. We must make greater efforts to help various ethnic minorities progress in economy and culture, making various ethnic minorities fully play an active role in China's socialist construction.

The situation of ethnic minorities has undergone great changes in the past few years. Democratic reforms and socialist transformations in ethnic minority areas have achieved decisive victories in most regions. Of the domestic population of over 35 million ethnic minorities, basic socialist transformation has been completed in areas with a population of 28 million, and socialist transformation is underway in areas with a population of 22 million, democratic reforms are underway in areas with a population of nearly 2 million, and only areas with a population of over 3 million have not yet undergone democratic reforms. When carrying out democratic reforms and socialist transformations in these areas, we must still adopt the prudent policy that we have consistently adopted, that is, the various ethnic minorities' people and public leaders should consider and handle matters according to their own wishes. In reforms, we must adhere to peaceful methods and not adopt methods of violent struggle. For the upper-class people of ethnic minorities, after they give up exploiting and oppressing the laboring people, the state should adopt appropriate measures to ensure that their political treatment and living standards do not decline, and persuade the masses to cooperate with them for a long time. For the issue of religious beliefs in ethnic minority areas, we must long-term adhere to the policy of freedom of religious belief and not interfere in social reforms; for the living difficulties of religious professionals, we should help them obtain appropriate solutions.

Various ethnic minorities must develop into modern nations. Apart from carrying out social reforms, the most fundamental key is to develop modern industry in their regions. The state has established some new industrial bases and undertaken some large-scale modern industries and transportation in some ethnic minority regions during the first five-year plan, and will continue to do so during the second five-year plan. This is in the common interest and fundamental interest of all nationalities' people. The Han people and ethnic minorities' people should all strive to fully realize the state's plan. At the same time, to meet the special needs of ethnic minorities' people, the central departments and the governments of provinces and autonomous regions should, based on objective feasibility and economic rationality, gradually undertake some local industries in ethnic minority regions. All industries in ethnic minority regions, whether they are centrally owned or locally owned, must pay attention to helping ethnic minorities form their own working class, cultivate their own scientific and technological cadres and enterprise management cadres. Only in this way can ethnic minorities' development in all aspects quickly reach a modern level.

Due to historical conditions, social reforms and economic and cultural construction in ethnic minorities all need the great assistance of the Han people, so it is particularly important to improve the relationship between the Han people and ethnic minorities, and between Han cadres and ethnic minority cadres. At present, to improve this relationship, the main problem is to overcome Han chauvinism.

In recent years, we have had many Han cadres working in various ethnic minority regions, and most of them have correctly implemented the Party's ethnic policies and completed the tasks assigned by the Party, receiving the welcome of ethnic minorities. However, some Han cadres do not respect the authority and opinions of ethnic minority cadres, do not actively and patiently help ethnic minorities to take charge, but instead take charge and act on their behalf. These shortcomings and errors are related to the Han chauvinist tendencies in the minds of some comrades.

The various nationalities in China have jointly created China's history and culture, and in the future, various nationalities will also jointly build our great socialist motherland. The development levels of various ethnic minorities in China are not the same, but it is not that all ethnic minorities are backward in all aspects. Some nationalities' development levels are the same as or similar to the Han nationality, and some nationalities are even higher than the Han nationality in certain aspects, worthy of learning from the Han people. Every nationality has its own strengths. The view that ethnic minorities have no strengths and are inferior to the Han nationality in all aspects is a Han chauvinist view.

Ignoring the important role of various ethnic minorities in China's socialist construction is also a manifestation of Han chauvinism. Various ethnic minorities, although they account for only 6% of the total population of the country, occupy about 60% of the total area of the country, and many of these places are rich in various industrial resources. If it is thought that without the joint efforts and active participation of ethnic minorities, the Han people's efforts alone can build China into a great socialist country, this is obviously a wrong idea.

All the above Han chauvinist tendencies and views must be corrected in earnest. Only by resolutely overcoming any small manifestation of Han chauvinism can the local ethnic nationalism sentiments in ethnic minorities be overcome smoothly, and the various brotherly nationalities in our people's democratic family can be more closely united.

To consolidate our people's democratic dictatorship, to safeguard the order of socialist construction and guarantee the democratic rights of the people, and to punish counter-revolutionaries and other criminals, one of the urgent tasks in our state work at present is to systematically formulate a relatively complete legal system and improve our state's legal system.

In the period of revolutionary war and the early days of national liberation, to eliminate the remaining enemies, suppress all counter-revolutionary resistance, destroy the reactionary order, and establish a revolutionary order, we could only formulate some temporary and guiding laws based on the policies of the Party and the people's government. In this period, the main task of the struggle was to liberate the people from the oppression of the reactionary regime and liberate social productive forces from the constraints of old production relations, and the main method of the struggle was the direct action of the masses. Therefore, those guiding laws were suitable for the needs of the time. Now, the period of revolutionary storm has passed, and new production relations have been established. The task of the struggle has changed to protecting the smooth development of social productive forces, so the method of the struggle must also change, and a complete legal system is completely necessary. For the normal life of society and the interests of social production, it is necessary to make everyone in the country understand and believe that as long as they do not violate the law, their citizen rights are guaranteed and they will not be invaded by any organ or any person; if someone invades them illegally, the state will necessarily intervene. All our state organs must strictly abide by the law, and our public security organs, procuratorial organs, and courts must implement the system of division of responsibilities and mutual restraint in the legal field.

Counter-revolutionaries are those who want to destroy our state, destroy our construction, and endanger the safety of the people, so our state organs must suppress and eliminate counter-revolutionaries. We led a nationwide campaign to suppress counter-revolutionaries in 1950, dealing a severe blow to the activities of counter-revolutionaries. In 1955, we again carried out a campaign to suppress counter-revolutionaries in society and conducted a purge of hidden counter-revolutionaries in all organs across the country. These large-scale mass struggles have greatly consolidated social order and strengthened state security.

We have consistently implemented the policy of combining punishment with leniency towards counter-revolutionaries and other criminals. Those who confess, repent, and perform meritorious deeds are all given lenient treatment. Everyone knows that this policy has achieved great results. Since the second half of last year, due to the influence of the policy of combining punishment with leniency and the influence of the high tide of socialist transformation, due to the improvement of the awareness and organization of the masses, the activities of counter-revolutionaries have become increasingly difficult, and there has been a fierce split among counter-revolutionaries, with batches of counter-revolutionaries surrendering to the government. This fact shows that, on the one hand, counter-revolutionaries do exist, and the idea of relaxing vigilance is completely wrong; on the other hand, as long as our policy is correct, counter-revolutionaries can be eliminated, and the idea that counter-revolutionary activities will become more serious is also groundless.

In the future, our public security organs, procuratorial organs, and courts must still resolutely struggle against counter-revolutionaries and other criminals. However, as mentioned above, this struggle must strictly abide by the legal system and should, based on the new situation at present, further implement the policy of leniency. The Central Committee of the Party believes that, except for a few criminals who, due to their extreme crimes, have caused public outrage and must be sentenced to death, all other criminals should not be sentenced to death, and they should be given completely humanitarian treatment during their imprisonment. All cases that need to be sentenced to death should be unanimously decided or approved by the Supreme People's Court. In this way, we can gradually achieve the goal of completely abolishing the death penalty, which is beneficial to our socialist construction.

To defend our motherland, we must continue to strengthen our national defense and continue to strengthen our national defense army—the glorious People's Liberation Army. Our army must strive to improve its combat effectiveness, vigilantly guard our borders and coastlines, and defend the integrity of our territory.

Our motherland's territory of Taiwan is still occupied by American imperialism, which is the greatest threat to our security. The issue of liberating Taiwan is completely an internal affair of our country. We are willing to use peaceful negotiations to make Taiwan return to the embrace of the motherland and avoid the use of force. If force is inevitably used, it is only when peaceful negotiations lose the possibility or fail. No matter which method is used, the just cause of liberating Taiwan will definitely achieve final victory.

To build our country into a great socialist country, we not only need to unite all possible forces within the country but also need to strive for all favorable international conditions and unite all possible international forces.

What is the current international environment in which our country is located?

Generally speaking, the current international situation is favorable for our socialist construction. This is because, after the Second World War, the forces of socialism, national independence, democracy, and peace have developed unprecedentedly, while the policy of the imperialist aggression group to actively expand, oppose peaceful coexistence, and prepare for a new world war has become increasingly unpopular. Under such circumstances, the world situation cannot but tend to ease, and the possibility of lasting world peace has begun to emerge.

After the October Revolution, when the Soviet people carried out socialist construction, there was no second socialist country in the world. However, when our people carry out socialist construction, the situation has fundamentally changed. After the Second World War, not only has the Soviet Union become stronger, but many new socialist countries have also emerged in Europe and Asia. Now, including China, socialist countries have already accounted for one-third of the world's population of over 900 million and are geographically connected, forming a friendly family of socialist countries led by the Soviet Union. Our brotherly friendship and mutual cooperation are constantly developing and consolidating. The Soviet Union and other socialist countries have restored friendly relations with the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia. Our country has also established diplomatic relations with the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia and developed friendly exchanges.

Now, the socialist countries are mobilizing all the forces of their people to engage in peaceful socialist construction, and industrial and agricultural production is developing at a speed that capitalist countries find difficult to match. In our foreign relations, we have consistently implemented a firm policy of peace, advocating peaceful coexistence and friendly cooperation between all countries. We believe in the superiority of the socialist system and are not afraid to compete peacefully with capitalist countries. Our policy is in line with the interests of all people in the world. All forces that love peace, seek national independence, and strive for social progress will receive our sympathy and support. The prestige of socialist countries among all people in the world is increasing, and their influence on the development of the international situation is expanding. The socialist countries led by the Soviet Union have become a strong bastion for the struggle for lasting world peace.

The 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union held this February is a major political event of global significance. It not only formulated the grand sixth five-year plan, decided on many major policies and guidelines for further developing the socialist cause, criticized the phenomenon of personality cult that had caused serious consequences within the Party, but also proposed to further promote peaceful coexistence and international cooperation, making a significant contribution to the easing of global tensions.

The strength and unity of socialist countries are the most favorable international conditions for our country to carry out socialist construction.

Another great historical development after the Second World War is the broad victory of the national independence movement. In addition to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and the People's Republic of China, which have embarked on the path of socialism, in Asia and Africa, there are other series of nationalist countries that have broken free from colonial rule. These nationalist countries, including our great neighbor India, have a total population of over 600 million, accounting for one-quarter of the world's population. The vast majority of these countries are implementing a policy of peaceful neutrality in foreign affairs. They are playing an increasingly important role in international affairs. The success of the Asian-African Conference held in Bandung, the new developments in the national independence movements of many Asian and African countries, and especially the recent event of Egypt nationalizing the Suez Canal Company, which shocked the world, prove that the national independence movement has become a great world force. In the past, the majority of Asian and African countries were once colonies and semi-colonies of imperialism, serving as their rear bases for preparing and waging wars, but now they have become forces opposing imperialism, opposing war, and supporting peaceful coexistence. At the same time, in the countries of Latin America, the struggle against imperialism is also developing. Imperialists are trying to block the tide of the national independence movement, but this tide is unstoppable. It will eventually sweep across the entire Asia, Africa, and Latin America, thus permanently ending the rule of imperialism.

Undoubtedly, the existence of socialist countries, the sympathy and support of socialist countries for the national independence movement, have greatly facilitated the development and victory of this movement. At the same time, the rise of the national independence movement has weakened the aggressive forces of imperialism, which is beneficial to the cause of world peace and thus beneficial to the peaceful construction of socialist countries. Therefore, the friendly cooperation between socialist countries and nationalist countries is not only in line with their common interests but also in line with the interests of world peace.

These great historical changes are contrary to the wishes of imperialism, especially American imperialism. American monopolistic capital, taking advantage of its favorable position after making a fortune in the Second World War, has been carrying out frenzied expansion activities after the war, first controlling defeated countries like Germany and Japan, seizing the spheres of influence of countries like Britain and France in Asia and Africa, and attempting to establish world hegemony. It has organized military alliances, established military bases, created tense situations, and prepared for a new war. American imperialism has called all these activities "defense against communist aggression." However, lies cannot cover up the facts. Socialism and aggression are fundamentally incompatible. In socialist countries, since the class that makes a fortune through aggression and makes a fortune through colonies and foreign markets has been eliminated, the social roots of external aggression have also been eliminated. In imperialist countries, the class that makes a fortune through aggression will never stop aggression voluntarily. The people of the world see clearly: the Soviet Union, China, and other socialist countries actively advocate peaceful coexistence, develop economic and cultural relations between the East and the West, and have taken the lead in reducing their armed forces and cutting their military expenditures. In contrast, American imperialism is still expanding its military forces, opposing the development of East-West relations, and fearing peaceful coexistence as if it were the end of the world; its armed forces are still occupying our Taiwan, thousands of kilometers away from its borders, and are rampant in the territories of Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, and Western European countries.

Using the slogans of "anti-communism" and "anti-communist" as a smokescreen to cover up the attempt of a country to rule the world has been prevalent since before the Second World War. Imperialists, of course, deeply hate socialist countries. However, they also know that strong and united socialist countries are unshakable. Therefore, the main activities of American imperialism at present are actually, under the guise of "anti-communism," to suppress its own people and control and interfere with the vast intermediate zone between socialist countries and the United States as much as possible.

The activities of American imperialism are increasingly provoking resistance from all sides and deepening all inherent contradictions within the capitalist system. Now, countries and peoples who have suffered or are suffering from the disasters of imperialism increasingly recognize that American imperialism is the greatest and most greedy imperialist at present. In the Asian and African regions, more and more nationalist countries are adopting a policy of peaceful neutrality, rejecting participation in American aggressive military alliances, and effectively limiting the colonial expansion of American imperialism. In Western countries, there are also more and more countries gradually seeing through the true harm of American expansion policies to themselves and rejecting being harnessed to America's war chariot, while the trend of supporting peaceful coexistence with socialist countries is also increasingly developing. The main allies of the United States, Britain and France, have once tried to maintain their vested interests by relying on American power. However, in fact, following America's policy of military expansion is only opening the door for American forces to invade, while the heavy burden of military expenditures is increasingly hindering the development of their national economies. This has strengthened the dissatisfaction and resistance of America's main allies to American monopoly and control, especially deepened the contradictions between Britain and America. At the same time, the people of Western countries are increasingly launching extensive peace and democracy movements, opposing America's policy of military expansion. The American people have also gradually realized that this policy brings them heavy burdens and the danger of war. Even within the American ruling class, there are some people with clearer minds who gradually realize that the policy of war may not be beneficial to America.

The foreign policies of the British and French ruling classes are in a state of contradiction and chaos. Britain and France, under the influence of the current overall international situation, have expressed a certain degree of willingness for peaceful coexistence, but they still do not want to give up the policy of military threats due to their attempt to maintain colonial privileges. This situation is particularly evident in the developments after the Egyptian government nationalized the Suez Canal Company. The British and French governments tried to use the method of military intervention to destroy Egypt's sovereignty and regain the Suez Canal. The United States, on the one hand, supported the aggressive behavior of Britain and France, and on the other hand, tried to seize their interests in the Middle East. The struggle between imperialist aggression policies and the anti-imperialist movements of nationalist countries is intensifying in the Middle East. The broadest sympathy in the world is on the side of Egypt, and the broadest public opinion in the world advocates a peaceful resolution of the Suez Canal dispute. If Britain and France do not follow the path of peaceful resolution but carry out military intervention, they will not only face the brave resistance of the Egyptian people and the Arab countries but will also certainly face the resolute opposition of the entire socialist camp, Asia and Africa, Latin America, and the broad masses of people in Western countries, and will also face the resolute opposition of the broad masses of people in Britain and France. The world is moving towards peace; adopting a policy of military intervention in the Suez Canal issue and other issues of the national independence movement will only lead to complete failure.

Undoubtedly, imperialists will continue to create tense situations, continue to oppress all people they can oppress, and the danger of war still exists. On this issue, if we lose vigilance, we will make mistakes. The struggle of mankind for peace and progress will inevitably go through many twists and turns. However, the overall trend of the world is bright. As long as the socialist countries and all peace-loving and democratic forces in the world unite and strive together, the cause of lasting world peace and human progress will ultimately achieve victory.

Our unshakable policy in international affairs is to strive for the cause of world peace and human progress. In the past few years, we have made achievements in this regard.

The Chinese people, in their revolutionary struggles, have received the support of the peace-loving and democratic socialist camp led by the Soviet Union. Soon after the founding of the People's Republic of China, we signed a Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance with the great Soviet Union. The past few years have proven that the great Sino-Soviet alliance is an important pillar of peace in the Far East and the world. The Soviet Union has provided great assistance to our socialist construction; the people's democratic countries in Europe and Asia have also provided various forms of assistance. The fraternal assistance of brother countries is something that the Chinese people will never forget. This assistance, whether in the past, present, or future, is indispensable to us. The unity and friendship between China and the great Soviet Union and other socialist countries, established on the basis of common goals and mutual assistance, is unbreakable and eternal. Continuing to consolidate and strengthen this unity and friendship is our highest international duty and the basis of our foreign policy.

China has suffered from the disasters of imperialism, and the territory of Taiwan is still under American control. The Chinese people deeply sympathize with and actively support the struggles of all oppressed nationalities and countries invaded by imperialism to oppose imperialism and maintain national independence. Every victory in this struggle, whether it occurs in Asia, Africa, or Latin America, will further strengthen the forces of peace.

China and other newly independent Asian and African countries have many common experiences, situations, and aspirations. In our general international relations, especially in our mutual relations, we all have the requirements of mutual respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty, non-aggression, non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence. The five principles proposed by China and India first embody these common requirements. We have already established friendly cooperative relations with many Asian and African countries based on these principles, promoting peace in this region.

We strive to establish good-neighborly relations with all our neighboring countries based on the five principles. We have deep traditional friendships with these countries and have no insurmountable disputes. Between us and some neighboring countries, there are some problems left over from history. Imperialists try to use this situation to disrupt and obstruct the development and establishment of friendly relations between us and neighboring countries. However, this attempt is doomed to fail. All problems between us and neighboring countries can be solved based on the five principles through peaceful negotiations. Developing and establishing friendly relations with neighboring countries is in the interests of our country and also in the interests of our neighboring countries.

Our country has already established normal relations with some Western European countries.

Our country is ready to establish normal diplomatic relations with all countries that have not yet established diplomatic relations with us. Establishing such relations is beneficial to both sides.

Our policy of peaceful coexistence based on the five principles does not exclude any country. We also have the same wish for peaceful coexistence with the United States. However, the United States has consistently been hostile to us, occupying our Taiwan, sending spies to carry out subversive activities against us, imposing an embargo on us, and trying to exclude us from international affairs and arbitrarily depriving us of our legal status in the United Nations. Despite this, our government has continued to try to resolve disputes with the United States through peaceful negotiations. We have repeatedly proposed holding a meeting of foreign ministers of China and the United States to resolve and ease the tense situation in the Taiwan region. Our efforts are only to ease international tensions and are not in any sense an acknowledgment of aggression. The whole world knows that the Chinese people are not afraid to pay the price to defend the independence and security of their motherland. However, the attitude of the American government towards us is still far from being realistic and reasonable. What is the result? Despite the various evil means used by American imperialism to destroy our country and attempt to isolate us, the great new China stands firm in the world. Justice is on our side, and the broadest sympathy in the world is on our side. The one that is isolated in the world is not our country but precisely American imperialism. If American imperialism does not want to continue to fail, its only way out is to adopt a realistic and reasonable attitude towards us. This situation is no longer a secret to the American people.

The Chinese people and the people of all countries need peace and need to increase economic and cultural relations and friendly exchanges. In the past few years, we have actively participated in various international activities beneficial to world peace and actively developed economic and cultural exchanges with the people of various countries, developing exchanges with people's organizations and various social figures. Although we have encountered many man-made obstacles in these aspects, our international friends are becoming more and more numerous. It is proven that the iron curtain is not on our side. Our door is open to everyone.

The above are the basic policies we use to handle international affairs. We will continue to implement these policies in the future.

During the period from the Seventh National Congress to the Eighth National Congress of the Party, with the victory of the revolution and the changes in the state situation, the situation of the Party itself has also undergone great changes. The Party has become the party leading the national power and has high prestige among the masses. The Party's organization has grown stronger. Now the Party has 1,073,000 members, of which 14% are workers, 69% are peasants, and 12% are intellectuals. The Party's organization has spread throughout the country and to all ethnic groups. The vast majority of Party members have been tempered by the great revolutionary struggle. Even the more than 60% of new Party members who joined after 1949 are basically advanced and active elements who have emerged from the mass revolutionary struggles and socialist labor in the past few years. Overall, the Party's ties with the masses have become closer, the Party's work experience has become richer and more comprehensive, and the Party's unity is stronger than ever before.

We have said that in our country's socialist cause, there must be proletarian dictatorship, and proletarian dictatorship is realized through the leadership of the proletariat's party—the Communist Party. The strength of the leadership of the Communist Party of China lies in its Marxist-Leninist ideological weapons, its correct political and organizational lines, its rich experience in struggle and work, its ability to concentrate the wisdom of the entire people, and its ability to express this wisdom as a unified will and disciplined action. Not only in the past but also in the future, to ensure that our country can effectively handle the complex domestic and international affairs, we must have such a party's leadership. This is acknowledged by all classes of people and all democratic parties based on actual life.

However, in the work of socialist construction, there have been a few comrades who have attempted to weaken the leadership of the Party. They confuse the Party's leadership of the policy and guidelines for various aspects of work with purely technical issues, thinking that the Party is an outsider in these technical and professional matters and therefore should not lead these matters, while they can act arbitrarily. We have criticized this wrong view. The Party should and can lead in ideology, politics, and policy guidelines for all work. Of course, this does not mean that the Party should take over everything and interfere in everything; nor does it mean that for things it does not understand, it can be content with being an outsider. The Party requires our cadres and Party members to undergo arduous study to learn the things they do not understand in their work. The more we learn, the better we will lead.

As we have said before, the line of our Party since the Seventh National Congress has been correct, which is proven by the facts. However, it must be admitted that our Party, in undertaking the increasingly heavy tasks at present, is not without difficulties and is not without the possibility of making mistakes. In socialist transformation, socialist construction, and state political life, we have made temporary and partial mistakes. In the handling of international affairs, there are also no shortcomings and mistakes. Therefore, one of the tasks of the Party's leadership is to study and analyze the mistakes made in the past, draw lessons from them, and strive to make fewer mistakes in future work, avoid repeating the mistakes already made, and avoid turning small mistakes into big ones.

To ensure that our Party continues to maintain correct and healthy leadership in the future, the fundamental issue is to strive to reduce the mistakes in the ideological understanding of Party organizations and Party members. In our Party, there is a struggle between correct and incorrect ideologies, correct and incorrect lines, which is a reflection of class struggle and various social phenomena. Our country was originally a country where the petty bourgeoisie was in the majority, and this class's sentiments constantly influence us, constantly putting pressure on us. The bourgeoisie also constantly influences us from various aspects. The Party must constantly carry out ideological education within the Party and not allow bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideologies to harm the political purity of our Party. However, our mistakes not only have social roots but also have roots in cognition. If a person does not understand that correct opinions can only be a comprehensive and objective reflection of actual things and insists on acting according to their subjective and one-sided ideas, then, even if they have all good intentions, they will still make big or small mistakes. Therefore, to avoid making mistakes, one must correctly understand objective reality and correctly distinguish right from wrong.

Given that currently 90% of our Party members are those who joined after the Seventh National Congress, it is not without practical significance to briefly review how the correct line in the history of our Party has effectively overcome the wrong line. The basic experience of this is as follows:

In the thirty-five years of our Party's history, we have made four serious line mistakes, namely, the right-opportunist line of Chen Duxiu in the first half of 1927 and the three "left"-opportunist line mistakes that occurred one after another in the following seven years. However, since the Zunyi Conference of the Central Committee of the Party in January 1935, under the leadership of the Central Committee led by Comrade Mao Zedong, our Party has not made any line mistakes in the following twenty-one years. How should this historical change be explained? It is clear that this cannot be explained merely by the length of the Party's history and the amount of experience. Because the mistakes made by the Party from 1931 to 1934 were even more serious than the previous two "left" mistakes; nor can it be explained merely by the personal situation of the Party's leader in a certain period. Because most of the leaders who made mistakes later did good work for the Party. From the history of our Party, we can draw the following conclusion: the amount of experience of the Party and the selection of the Party's leaders are important to whether the Party makes mistakes, but what is more important is whether the broad Party members, especially the high-level cadres in each period, are good at using the Marxist-Leninist standpoint, viewpoint, and method to summarize the experience of struggle, uphold the truth, and correct mistakes. This is the main marker of the level of Marxist-Leninist consciousness of Party cadres. The higher the level of Marxist-Leninist consciousness of Party cadres, the higher their ability to distinguish correct opinions from incorrect opinions, good leaders from bad leaders, and the higher their work ability.

Before 1934, although the Party had accumulated rich experience, the Party's leading organs did not give it serious research; although several wrong lines had been negated, in fact, only the leaders who made mistakes were punished, and the wrong lines and the ideological roots of those mistakes were not correctly analyzed, so it was impossible to help Party cadres improve their consciousness. Especially from 1931 to 1934, the period when the "left"-opportunist line led by Comrade Wang Ming and Bo Gu dominated the entire Party, not only did they not accept the lessons of the previous wrong lines, but due to their dogmatic thinking and arbitrary style, they developed the errors of subjectivism and sectarianism to an unprecedented degree in the history of the Party. They completely ignored the actual situation of various classes in the country at that time, ignored the objective situation of the balance of power between the enemy and us, and adopted extremely adventurous policies in politics and military affairs, and in Party life, they completely destroyed the democratic system within the Party, developing excessive intra-Party struggles. Their wrong leadership led to serious failures in the revolutionary struggle, causing the revolutionary base areas and the Red Army to lose 90%, and the Party organizations and revolutionary organizations led by the Party in the Kuomintang-controlled areas to lose almost 100%.

However, after 1935, things were different. The basic change in the Party in 1935 was the result of the majority of high-level cadres gaining experience from failure and improving their consciousness. After that, the Central Committee of the Party did not give serious punishment to the comrades who made mistakes but still assigned them appropriate leadership positions and patiently waited for and helped them to truly recognize their mistakes in their minds. At the same time, the Central Committee of the Party systematically helped the entire Party to gradually understand the principle of combining Marxist-Leninist theory with practice, understand the principle that our subjective cognition must conform to objective reality. Due to the significant improvement in the Party's ideological work and organizational work, the Party's cause developed rapidly. To help all Party cadres, including those who made mistakes, seriously study the historical experience of the Party, learn the correct methods of thinking and working, and reduce mistakes in work, the Central Committee of the Party launched the famous "Rectification Movement" to oppose subjectivism, sectarianism, and Party jargon seven years after the Zunyi Conference, organizing all Party cadres to check their thoughts and work in detail according to the Marxist-Leninist standpoint, viewpoint, and method, check the leadership of the Party in ideology, politics, and organization, and carry out in-depth criticism and self-criticism. In this way, the Marxist-Leninist consciousness and the ability to distinguish right from wrong within the Party of a large number of cadres were truly improved. A large number of cadres recognized the errors of dogmatism that were detached from reality, also recognized the errors of empiricism that were detached from theory, and cultivated the style of linking with the masses, conducting investigations, and seeking truth from facts. Their work inside and outside the Party became more in line with objective reality, and major mistakes in work were reduced.

The above-mentioned historical experience of our Party fully illustrates that overcoming subjectivism in ideological understanding is the key to ensuring the smooth development of the Party's work and avoiding major mistakes.

The errors of subjectivism still seriously exist in the thoughts and work of many of our cadres at present, causing our work to suffer many unnecessary losses. We now face new conditions and new tasks, and we must solve many more complex and unfamiliar problems. Under such circumstances, if we do not strive to improve the level of Marxist-Leninist consciousness, do not strive to learn new knowledge, and study new businesses, but are satisfied with the praise of victory, the errors of subjectivism will inevitably develop. At the same time, a large number of new Party members who have joined our Party have not received sufficient Marxist-Leninist tempering and are also easily become a market for subjectivism and dogmatism.

To effectively oppose subjectivism, we must make systematic efforts to improve the level of Marxist-Leninist consciousness of our Party. First, we must seriously strengthen the systematic Marxist-Leninist study of cadres, especially high-level cadres, making them good at using the Marxist-Leninist standpoint, viewpoint, and method to observe and solve practical problems in life, improving their ability to judge direction and distinguish right from wrong in complex situations, and learning to use Marxist-Leninist theory to study and organize their work experience, finding the law of development of specific things in experience. Second, we must strengthen the education of theory and practice unity among the broad new Party members, making them gradually understand the Marxist-Leninist standpoint, viewpoint, and method, obtaining basic knowledge of Marxist-Leninist general principles, the history of the Party, and the current situation of China's socialist cause, recognizing the harm of subjectivism—including dogmatism and empiricism—and especially in new intellectual Party members, emphasizing the recognition of the harm of dogmatism. Third, we must strengthen the theoretical work of the Party. We should quickly concentrate the necessary Marxist-Leninist scientific research forces within and outside the Party to study the major issues and basic experiences of China's socialist transformation and socialist construction, study current international issues, study Marxist-Leninist basic theory and scientific fields closely related to Marxist-Leninism, making this series of studies meet the urgent needs of the current Party's practical work and the urgent needs of conducting Marxist-Leninist education of theory and practice unity for the broad Party members and the broad youth.

To effectively oppose subjectivism, the leading organs of the Party at all levels must greatly strengthen the work of investigating and studying actual situations. In the Party's work in the past few years, the mistakes of right conservatism, impetuous advancement, and compulsory orders that have been made are all due to the failure to seriously and correctly study actual situations and concentrate the experience of the masses. Many Party workers, like some state organ workers mentioned earlier, have begun to show arrogant and self-satisfied sentiments, preferring to sit in the office, replacing investigation with empty talk, determining policies based on personal feelings, and not willing to go deep into the grassroots, listen to the voices from below, check the implementation of Party resolutions, and verify the correctness of Party resolutions through practice, diligently study new things, and correctly support the development of new things. The Party must educate them to deeply realize the harm caused by their subjectivism in work, must help them learn to conduct investigations and studies among the masses with an honest attitude, help them learn the "from the masses, to the masses" working method, and make them understand that this is a necessary condition for them to continue to undertake the leadership work of the Party.

To strive for the Party's leadership work to conform to objective reality, facilitate the concentration of the experience and opinions of the masses, and reduce the opportunity for mistakes, it is necessary to implement the principle of collective leadership and expand Party democracy in all Party organizations without exception. All major decisions must be made in an appropriate collective after full discussion, allowing unrestrained debate of different opinions, so that the opinions of Party members and non-Party members inside and outside the Party can be more fully reflected, that is, the various aspects of the development process of objective things can be more fully reflected. Each leader must be good at patiently listening to and calmly considering opposing opinions, resolutely accepting reasonable opposing opinions or the reasonable parts of opposing opinions; for any comrade who proposes any opposing opinions with correct motives and in normal procedures, they must continue to work harmoniously without adopting an exclusionary attitude. Only in this way can there be true rather than formal collective leadership, true rather than formal Party unity, and the organization and cause of the Party will be more prosperous.

Regarding the implementation of the principle of collective leadership of the Party and the expansion of Party democracy, the new draft of the Constitution of the Communist Party of China proposed by the Central Committee of the Party has paid full attention. Deng Xiaoping will give a detailed explanation of this draft, so I do not need to say more here. The draft constitution has made some new regulations on the rights of Party members and the rights of lower-level organizations of the Party. The draft stipulates that Party members have the right to fully exert their creativity in their work, and when they disagree with the resolutions of the Party, in addition to unconditionally executing them, they have the right to reserve their opinions and submit their opinions to the leading organs of the Party. The draft stipulates that all issues of a local nature and issues that need to be decided by local authorities should be handled by local organizations to facilitate local conditions; it also stipulates that if the lower-level organizations of the Party believe that the resolutions of the upper-level organizations do not conform to the actual situation of the region or department, they should request the upper-level organizations to change these resolutions. The draft constitution also stipulates that the Party congresses at the county level and above are changed to a permanent system, convening once a year. All of these will promote the high tide of activism in the organizations and all Party members of our Party.

Of course, the expansion of democratic life in our Party is not weakening but precisely strengthening the centralized system of our Party. The promotion of creativity by Party members of our Party is not weakening but precisely strengthening the discipline of our Party. Similarly, the principle of collective leadership of our Party is not denying the necessity of personal responsibility and the important role of leaders; on the contrary, it is a guarantee for leaders to fully and most effectively exert their personal role. Everyone knows that the reason why Comrade Mao Zedong, the leader of our Party, has played a great role as the helmsman in our revolutionary cause and enjoys high prestige among the entire Party and the people of the whole country is not only because he is good at combining the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the specific practice of the Chinese revolution but also because he firmly trusts the strength and wisdom of the masses, advocates the mass line in the work of the Party, and adheres to the democratic principles and the principles of collective leadership of the Party.

Taking the correct attitude towards comrades who make mistakes is a necessary condition for the correct leadership of the Party.

Giving severe punishment to comrades who make mistakes, even expelling them from the Party, is very easy. However, if the ideological issue of why the mistake was made is not solved, then severe punishment not only cannot guarantee that the Party will not repeat the same mistake but may even cause greater mistakes. In the period when the "left"-opportunist line dominated our Party, the method of "ruthless struggle and merciless blows" implemented in intra-Party struggles only created a situation of unclear right and wrong and stagnation within the Party, causing the vital forces within the Party to be damaged, and causing the Party's cause to suffer great losses.

After the Central Committee of the Party, led by Comrade Mao Zedong, corrected the opportunist line of Comrade Wang Ming and Bo Gu, it also thoroughly changed the wrong method of intra-Party struggle.

In intra-Party struggles, the Party first strictly distinguished the boundary between the issue of right and wrong within the Party and the issue of counter-revolutionary elements, degenerate elements, and other bad elements who infiltrated the Party and carried out disruptive activities within the Party. For counter-revolutionary elements who infiltrated the Party and carried out disruptive activities within the Party, class alien elements who firmly carried out disruptive activities within the Party, and other incorrigible degenerate elements, the Party adopted a resolute attitude and expelled them. In our ranks, there are indeed some counter-revolutionary elements and other bad elements, and we have already cleaned out some and will continue to pay attention to prevention and cleaning in the future. However, it is proven that such people are only a very small number. After the Party took over state power, phenomena of corruption, lawlessness, and moral degeneration have developed to a certain extent within the Party, and this serious phenomenon must be resolutely stopped. In the past, we carried out mass struggles against corruption, waste, and lawlessness, and later smashed the anti-Party alliance of Gao Gang and Rao Shushi, which attempted to seize the leadership of the Party and the state by conspiratorial means. In the future, we must continue to carry out ideological and organizational struggles against the phenomenon of corruption and degeneration, and continue to expel incorrigible degenerate elements from the Party.

However, for any comrade who makes mistakes in work due to mistakes in understanding, the Party has consistently implemented the principle of "punishing the past to educate the future, curing the sickness to save the person," "clearing up thoughts and uniting comrades," emphasizing ideological education and not easily taking disciplinary action. For the erroneous thoughts of these comrades, we must criticize them in a factual manner and specifically analyze the root causes of the errors. The purpose of doing this is to help them and continue to unite them to work together. For comrades who have made serious mistakes in work, although they need to be given appropriate disciplinary action or appropriately transferred to other work, they must still be helped with a comradely attitude to recognize and correct their mistakes to achieve the goal of unity. In short, for comrades who make mistakes, as long as the mistakes can be corrected within the Party and the person is willing to correct them, they must be allowed to stay in the Party to correct them, and they should not abuse organizational power to give inappropriate punishment. On the contrary, if simple and brutal methods are used to correct mistakes of an ideological nature, then not only will the ideological problem not be solved, but mistakes will be repeated, and the necessary harmony within the Party will inevitably be harmed, and even ordinary differences of opinion may develop into organizational splits.

The Party has improved its Marxist-Leninist consciousness, strengthened the work of investigating and studying actual situations, expanded Party democracy, and adopted the correct approach to mistakes in work. In this way, the unity and solidarity of the Party will necessarily be increasingly consolidated. The unity and solidarity of the Party, of course, are not only in the interests of the Party itself but also in the interests of the entire working class and the people of the whole country, because the Party is the leading core of the entire working class and the people of the whole country.

We must firmly unite the entire Party to consolidate the unity of the entire working class and the people of the whole country. The source of all our strength lies in our ability to closely rely on the working class and the people.

To build our country into a great socialist country, we must make every effort to continue to strengthen the unity of the Party and the masses.

The broadest masses in our country have already been organized. Various mass organizations are necessary links for our Party to connect with the masses. In addition to the farmers' cooperatives mentioned earlier, the most important mass organizations are trade union organizations, youth league organizations, and women's organizations.

Our trade union organizations now have 12 million members and have played a major role in national construction. The Party should strengthen its leadership of trade union work and, through trade union work, cultivate China's working class into an organized, conscious, and culturally and technically skilled class, making the broad masses of workers closely unite around the Party. Trade union organizations, in the cause of socialist construction, on the one hand, should use the method of persuasion and education to attract the masses of workers and, through socialist competition and the movement of advanced producers, strive to continuously improve labor productivity; on the other hand, they should also closely care for the lives of the masses and play the role of supervision of the masses, bravely fighting against all phenomena of lawlessness, infringement of the interests of the masses, and indifference to the lives of the masses in all enterprises. Any tendency to neglect either of these two tasks is wrong and should be corrected.

The Chinese New Democratic Youth League, which has 20 million members, will soon be renamed the Communist Youth League of China. Due to the effective efforts of the Youth League in the past few years, among the vigorous young workers, young peasants, young scientific and technical personnel, and other young intellectuals in our country, a continuous stream of shock forces for the socialist cause is growing, and a large number of new Party members are being sent to the Party. The Youth League should, under the leadership of the Party, carry out more lively ideological and organizational work among its members and the broad masses of young people, overcoming the shortcomings of some youth organizations that do not pay attention to adopting work methods suitable for young people and do not use methods of persuasion and education to promote the enthusiasm and initiative of the young masses.

Our Party has consistently cared for and supported the women's liberation movement, regarding the thorough liberation of women as one of the important goals of our cause. The women's masses in our country are now playing an increasingly important role in agricultural and industrial labor and other many social sectors. Female cadres on various work posts are growing rapidly. The Party should continue to inspire the progressive spirit of the women's masses, help them overcome certain unique difficulties in participating in work, help them improve their proficiency in work, correct all erroneous thoughts of discriminating against women within and outside the Party, and pay attention to establishing new moral customs of gender equality and protecting women and children in social life and family life. The Democratic Women's Federation, which has been established in all parts of the country, is a mass organization of the broad masses of women. The Party should care for and help its work and, through it, strengthen the connection between the Party and the women's masses.

To consolidate the close ties between our Party and the masses, we must continue to strengthen our work among the masses in all aspects, especially we must repeatedly carry out education on wholeheartedly serving the people among all cadres and Party members. An excellent Party member and an excellent leader is characterized by being familiar with the living and working conditions of the people, caring for the joys and sorrows of the people, understanding the hearts of the people; they insist on a frugal and plain style, sharing weal and woe with the people, and are willing to accept the criticism and supervision of the people without putting on any airs before the people; they consult with the people on matters, and the people are also willing to talk to them. As long as our Party is composed of such Party members, we will have inexhaustible and unconquerable strength.

Just as our Party relies on the support of the people of our country at home, we rely on the support of the working class of all countries and the support of the people of all countries abroad. Without the great internationalism of the working class of all countries, without the support of international revolutionary forces, our socialist cause cannot be victorious, and even if it is victorious, it cannot be consolidated.

We must continue to strengthen our unity with the brother parties of all countries, the workers' parties, and must continue to learn from the revolutionary experience and construction experience of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and other countries. Towards any brother party, we must adopt an enthusiastic and modest attitude and resolutely oppose any danger of great-power chauvinism and bourgeois nationalism.

The Chinese revolution is part of the international proletarian revolutionary cause. Our achievements contain the fruits of the struggles of the working class and laboring people of all countries. The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party hereby expresses its heartfelt thanks and respect to the brother parties of all countries and, through them, to the working class and laboring people of all countries, and guarantees to stand with them in unity forever.

Let all comrades of our Party always be united! Let us always be united with the people of the whole country, always be united with the working class of all countries and the people of the whole world! Our great socialist cause will definitely be victorious, and no force in the world can stop our victory!

    中国共产党中央委员会向第八次全国代表大会的政治报告
    （一九五六年九月十五日）
    刘少奇同志们！
    从我们党的第七次代表大会以来，十一年已经过去了。我们的祖国在这十一年内经历了两次有世界意义的伟大历史事变。在一九四九年，我们党领导人民推翻了帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义的反动统治，建立了中华人民共和国。在去年下半年和今年上半年，我们党又领导人民取得了农业、手工业、资本主义工商业的社会主义改造的全面的决定性的胜利。由于这两次胜利，我们国家的内外关系发生了一系列的根本变化。
    除开台湾还被美国侵略者侵占以外，近百年来骑在中国人民头上的外国帝国主义势力已经被赶走了。中国已经成为伟大的独立自主的国家。
    外国帝国主义的工具——官僚买办资产阶级已经在中国大陆上消灭了。
    封建地主阶级，除开个别地区以外，也已经消灭了。富农阶级也正在消灭中。原来剥削农民的地主和富农，正在被改造成为自食其力的新人。
    民族资产阶级分子正处在由剥削者变为劳动者的转变过程中。
    广大的农民和其他个体劳动者，已经变为社会主义的集体劳动者。
    工人阶级已经成为国家的领导阶级。它的队伍扩大了，它的觉悟程度和文化技术水平大大提高了。
    知识界也已经改变了原来的面貌，组成了一支为社会主义服务的队伍。
    国内各民族已经组成为一个团结友好的民族大家庭。
    以共产党为领导的人民民主统一战线，更加扩大和巩固了。
    我们的国家参加了以苏联为首的争取持久和平和人类进步的社会主义阵营，同伟大的苏联和各人民民主国家建立了牢不可破的友好合作关系。我国人民在胜利的抗美援朝战争中制止了帝国主义侵略者的凶焰。我国在国际关系中坚持和平共处的五项原则。我国的国际地位提高了。
    所有这些变化，不但唤起了中国六亿人民的空前未有的革命积极性，而且在世界生活中，在一切被压迫的民族和一切被剥削的人民中，不能不发生伟大的吸引力。
    我们党现时的任务，就是要依靠已经获得解放和已经组织起来的几亿劳动人民，团结国内外一切可能团结的力量，充分利用一切对我们有利的条件，尽可能迅速地把我国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义国家。
    为了完成这个巨大的任务，我们应当正确地总结我们在过去时期的斗争经验，继续完成我国的社会主义改造，进一步加强我国的社会主义建设，进一步健全我国的政治生活，正确地处理国际事务，进一步巩固我们党。我们的大会对于这一切问题的讨论和决定，将促进我们党和我国人民在已有的胜利的基础上，取得新的更大的胜利。（一）党在过渡时期的总路线
    在十一年前，党的第七次代表大会向全党提出的任务，是“放手发动群众，壮大人民力量，团结全国一切可能团结的力量，打败侵略者，建设新中国”。这个任务，已经在一九四九年实现了。
    反动派常常自己选择走向灭亡的道路。我们党的第七次代表大会的方针是要求国民党同全国民主力量成立联合政府。还在抗日战争初期，我们党就曾经同国民党成立了联合抗日的协议。在以后，特别是在抗日战争结束以后，我们党又曾经多次同国民党进行和平谈判，以图避免内战，并且试图经过和平的道路实现中国的社会政治改革。在一九四六年，我们和几个民主党派曾经同国民党达成了一个和平建国的协议。但是接着国民党反动派却在美帝国主义的支持下发动了全国的大内战，企图消灭代表中国人民的力量——中国共产党和其他一切进步民主力量。他们想错了。我们党在争取和平改革的时候并没有放弃警惕，没有放弃人民的武装。我们的政策是：如果国民党愿意和平，并且愿意在和平的条件下进行改革，这是有利于人民的，是我们所力争的。但是我们知道，和平的愿望能否实现，却不取决于我们，而取决于当时的统治阶级。如果国民党反动派一定要把战争强加在人民头上，那么，我们也作了充分的准备，能够动员人民的力量击败他们，使战争的发动者自食其果。历史所作的结论正是这样。想要消灭人民力量的人们，自己被人民的力量消灭了。
    同反动派相反，人民不是好战的。即使在战争期间，凡能和平解放的地方，例如北京、绥远、长沙、昆明、四川西部、新疆和西藏，我们都做了争取、接洽和谈判的工作，实现了和平解放。但是当着人民被迫而不能不拿起武器的时候，人民拿起武器来是完全正确的。反对人民这样做，要求人民向进攻的敌人屈服，这就是机会主义的路线。在这里，究竟采取革命的路线，还是采取机会主义的路线，这是关系到六亿人民在时机成熟的时候是否应当取得政权的大问题。我们党采取了革命的路线，因而有了今天的中华人民共和国。
    在中华人民共和国成立以后，由于工人阶级在同几亿农民建立了坚固同盟的条件下取得了全国范围的统治权力，工人阶级的政党中国共产党成为领导全国政权的政党，人民民主专政实质上已经成为无产阶级专政的一种形式。这就使我国的资产阶级民主性质的革命有可能经过和平的道路，直接地转变为无产阶级社会主义性质的革命。因此，中华人民共和国的成立，标志着我国资产阶级民主革命阶段的基本结束和无产阶级社会主义革命阶段的开始，标志着我国由资本主义到社会主义的过渡时期的开始。
    我国过渡时期的基本特点是什么呢？
    第一，我们的国家是一个工业落后的国家。为了建设社会主义社会，必须发展社会主义的工业，首先是重工业，使我们的国家由落后的农业国变为先进的工业国，而这是需要一个相当长的时间的。
    第二，在我们的国家里，工人阶级的同盟者不但有农民和城市小资产阶级，而且有民族资产阶级。因此，为了改造旧经济，不但对于农业和手工业需要采取和平改造的方法，而且对于资本主义工商业，也需要采取和平改造的方法，而这就需要逐步进行，需要时间。
    党中央委员会根据我国的具体情况，规定了我们党在过渡时期的总路线，这就是：在一个相当长的时间内，逐步实现社会主义的工业化，逐步完成对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造。党的这个总路线是在一九五二年国民经济恢复阶段终结的时候提出的，在一九五四年已经为全国人民代表大会所接受，作为国家在过渡时期的总任务，记载在中华人民共和国宪法里面。
    党在过渡时期的总路线是照耀我们各项工作的灯塔。各项工作离开它，就要犯右倾或者“左”倾的错误。在过去几年中，从右面离开党的总路线的倾向，主要地是仅仅满足于资产阶级民主革命的既得成就，要求把革命停顿下来，不承认我们的革命有向社会主义过渡的必要，不愿意对城市和农村的资本主义采取适当的限制政策，不相信党能够领导农民走向社会主义，不相信党能够领导全国人民建成社会主义。从“左”面离开党的总路线的倾向，主要地是要求在“一个早上”就实现社会主义，要求在我国用没收的方法消灭民族资产阶级，或者用排挤的方法使资本主义工商业破产，不承认过渡到社会主义应当采取逐步前进的步骤，不相信我们可以经过和平的道路达到社会主义革命的目的。我们党坚决地拒绝和批判了这两种错误的倾向。很明显，如果我们党接受这些意见的任何一种，我们就将不能建设社会主义，或者不能如同今天这样顺利地建设社会主义。
    按照过渡时期的总路线，我国已经在一九五三年开始了发展国民经济的第一个五年计划。党中央委员会原来预计，完成过渡时期的总任务，将需要大约三个五年计划的时间。第一个五年计划的实践证明，为了完成国家的工业化，三个五年计划的时间是必要的，或者还需要更多一点时间。但是社会主义改造的任务，在第一个五年计划期间就已经基本上完成，而在第二个五年计划期间，除开个别地区以外，就可以全部完成。
    （二）社会主义改造
    我国的农业、手工业、资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，现在已经取得了决定性的胜利。
    根据今年六月的统计，全国一亿二千万农户中，加入农业生产合作社的，已经有一亿一千万户，占农户总数的百分之九十一点七。其中，有三千五百万户加入了初级合作社；有七千五百万户，即大多数，加入了高级合作社。畜牧业中的互助合作运动，也已经有了发展。
    全国个体手工业者参加了各种不同形式的生产合作组织。加入工业生产合作社、生产小组或者供销生产合作社的，已经占个体手工业从业人员总数的百分之九十。个体渔民、个体盐民和运输业中的个体劳动者，现在也基本上实现了合作化。
    全国资本主义工商业已经基本上实现了全行业的公私合营。个体小商业也已经基本上实现了合作化，为国营商业和合作社商业执行代销代购的业务。
    这些成就，主要地是在一九五五年下半年开始的我国农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造运动的高潮中达到的。
    这个社会主义改造运动高潮的出现，不是偶然的，而是一九四九年以来我国各种社会条件发展成熟的必然结果。
    中华人民共和国成立以后，人民政府没收了控制国家经济命脉的全部官僚资本的企业，包括由国民党政府在抗战胜利以后接收的日、德、意各国在中国的企业，把它们变为国营的社会主义企业，使国家掌握了最大的银行，几乎全部的铁路，绝大多数的钢铁工业，其他重工业的主要部分，以及轻工业的某些重要部分。这就为我国社会主义经济的优越地位奠定了基础。
    人民政府接着用极大的努力发展了国营工业、国营运输业和其他国营企业。国营工业产值在一九四九年还只占全部工业总产值的百分之二十六点三，到一九五二年就已经占百分之四十一点五，而到一九五五年，就已经占百分之五十一点三了。
    人民政府把全部私营银行和钱庄改造为在国家银行领导下的统一的公私合营银行，由国家集中经营银行信贷、保险业务和黄金、白银、外国货币的交易。人民政府建立了对外贸易的管制，实行了外汇的管理。人民政府又建立了全国统一的强大的国营商业和供销合作社商业，掌握了主要的工业原料和主要的货源，逐步地实现了批发商业的国有化，巩固了社会主义商业在全国市场上的领导地位。
    强大的社会主义经济的发展，使我们取得了对于农业、手工业、资本主义工商业进行社会主义改造的物质基础。但是为了完成社会主义改造的任务，还必须采取适合我国情况的政策和步骤，才能使我国广大的农民和手工业者乐于参加集体经济，使我国的民族资产阶级不太勉强地接受社会主义改造。
    我们采取了那些政策和步骤呢？现在，我们就农业、手工业、资本主义工商业的改造分别地作一些简单的说明。
    首先，我们要说明的是农业的社会主义改造。
    我国的农业合作化运动是在彻底完成了土地改革的基础上进行的。我们党没有采取单纯依靠行政命令、“恩赐”农民土地的办法，去进行土地改革。在中华人民共和国成立以后，我们花了整整三年的时间，用彻底发动农民群众的群众路线的方法，充分地启发农民特别是贫农的阶级觉悟，经过农民自己的斗争，完成了这一任务。我们花了这样多的时间是否需要呢？我们认为这是完全需要的。由于我们采取了这样的方法，广大的农民就站立起来，组织起来，紧紧地跟了共产党和人民政府走，牢固地掌握了乡村的政权和武装。因此，土地改革不但在经济上消灭了地主阶级和大大地削弱了富农，也在政治上彻底地打倒了地主阶级和孤立了富农。广大的觉悟的农民认为，无论是地主或者富农的剥削行为都是可耻的。这就为后来的农业的社会主义改造创造了有利的条件，大大地缩短了农业合作化所需要的时间。
    在旧中国的农村人口中，有百分之六十到七十的贫农和雇农群众，他们是农村中的半无产阶级和无产阶级，他们容易接受工人阶级的领导，不只是在资产阶级民主革命中有很大的积极性，就是在社会主义革命中也有很大的积极性。在土地改革以后，广大农民群众的经济地位是改善了，很多贫农雇农上升为中农。但是由于我国农村地少人多，全国农民平均每人只有三亩耕地（约等于五分之一公顷），南方许多地方每人只有一亩田或者只有几分田，所以在农村中仍然有百分之六十到七十的贫农和下中农。在继续个体经营的条件下，他们要想过富裕的生活是毫无把握的。这就使占农村人口大多数的贫农和不富裕的农民积极地响应我们党的号召，愿意走合作化的道路。
    在土地改革以后，我们随即在农民中广泛地建立了带有社会主义萌芽的农业生产互助组织。这是农民的一种集体劳动组织。由于互助比“单干”优越，在一九五二年参加互助组织的农户已经占全国农户总数的百分之四十，在一九五四年又增加到将近百分之五十八。在互助组织的基础上，党中央在一九五二年开始有计划地发展半社会主义的农业生产合作社，这是以土地入股、统一经营、但仍然保持土地和主要生产资料私有的一种初级合作社。这种合作社在一九五一年底还只有三百多个；由于它又比互助组织优越得多，到一九五五年上半年已经发展到六十七万个，参加的农户约一千七百万户。从一九五五年下半年以后，像大家所知道的，由于党中央和毛泽东同志纠正了党内抑制农民的合作化积极性的右倾保守思想，农业生产合作社开始了特别迅速的发展。随后，初级合作社又开始大批地改组成能够更有效地组织生产的社会主义的高级合作社，在这种合作社里，土地和其他主要生产资料都由私有变成了集体所有。事实证明，我们党采取这种逐步前进的办法是适当的。因为这使得农民在合作化运动中不断地得到好处，逐渐地习惯于集体生产的方式，可以比较自然地、比较顺利地脱离土地和其他主要生产资料的私人所有制，接受集体所有制，从而避免了或者大大减少了由于突然变化而可能引起的种种损。
    在农业合作化运动中，党的阶级政策是，树立贫农和土地改革以后由贫农上升的下中农在合作社内部的领导优势，同时巩固地联合中农。富裕的和比较富裕的中农在农村中虽然居于少数，但是他们对于下中农以至贫农仍然有重要的影响。这些富裕中农一般地是拥护共产党和人民政府的，他们中间的许多人还是在土地改革中“翻身”的，但是他们对于走合作化的道路却不可避免地要发生动摇。为了巩固同中农的联合，这里的关键是必须在合作化运动中坚持自愿和互利的政策。自愿和互利的政策是适用于一切人的，对于中农更有重要的意义。党不但禁止勉强中农加入合作社，而且规定在合作化初发展的时候，首先吸收贫农和下中农入社，一般地不吸收比较富裕的中农入社。党又规定，在中农入社以前和以后，特别是在处理入社的生产资料的时候，都不允许损害他们的利益，占他们的便宜；当然也不让中农损害贫农的利益，占贫农的便宜。国家在粮食问题上的正确政策，也对于中农发生了有益的影响。从一九五三年开始，国家对于粮食和其他主要农产品实行了统购统销，并且在统购统销中规定了合理的价格，这就基本上消灭了市场上的粮食和其他主要农产品的资本主义投机活动。在一九五五年，国家又规定把购粮数量限制在一定的水平上，改正了前一年不适当地多购七十亿斤粮食的错误，这就消除了农民担心政府收购过多的疑虑。由于党坚定不移地执行了联合中农的方针，由于中农看到了走资本主义道路的无望，看到了合作社生产的日益显著的优越性，广大的中农在合作化的高潮中终于停止了动摇，积极地要求入社了。
    对于原来的地主分子和富农分子，党在过去几年中一贯地注意了领导农民防止和反对他们在合作化运动中的破坏活动，在合作化初期禁止他们加入合作社。只是在合作化运动取得胜利以后，党才决定分别地根据他们的具体情况，允许他们以不同的身份到合作社里进行同工同酬的劳动，以便把他们改造成为新人。
    由于实行了以上的政策，我们就能在全国范围的土地改革完成以后不到四年的时间内，基本上完成了农业的社会主义改造，把全国的一亿一千万农户组织成为一百万个左右大小不等的、高级的和初级的农业生产合作社。
    其次，我们要说明的是手工业和其他个体经济的社会主义改造。
    我国广大的手工业个体劳动者除开在极小范围内能够自产自销以外，都要依靠国营商业、供销合作社和资本主义企业供给原料、推销成品和借给资金。他们中间的多数人生活困难，疾病伤亡没有保险。他们的生产技术多数是落后的，有被现代机器生产淘汰的可能。因此，他们希望联合起来，在国营经济的领导下克服这些困难。而从整个国民经济的利益来说，很多的手工业生产是必须继续保存和发展的，这不但是为了满足国内市场的广大需要，而且部分地是为了供应出口贸易的需要。中国的个体渔民、盐民、小商小贩和运输业中的个体劳动者，也有很大的数量，他们的情况同手工业者大体相近。
    对于手工业、渔业、盐业和运输业的社会主义改造，一般地是采取合作化的形式。这些方面的合作化运动，在过去几年内陆续有所发展。到一九五五年，加入手工业生产合作组织的人数占手工业从业人员总数的百分之二十九。手工业和其他个体经济合作化的大发展，是在今年上半年。新成立的合作社，有些是经过生产小组的过渡形式发展起来的，大部分是在今年的合作化高潮中直接组织的。此外，有一小部分手工业和一小部分属于资本主义经营方式的木帆船、兽力车，同资本主义工商业一起实行了公私合营。
    小商小贩是个体的商业劳动者。他们在社会主义改造中，除了一部分随着资本主义商业实行公私合营以外，一般地也走上了合作化的道路，组成合作商店或者合作小组。小商小贩所组织的合作小组，为国营商业和供销合作社代销代购，而照旧采取便利消费者的分散流动的经营方式，照旧保存它们原有的符合社会需要的经营特点。
    最后，我们要说明的是资本主义工商业的社会主义改造。
    在我国曾经占统治地位的大资产阶级主要是官僚买办资产阶级，这个阶级如前面所说，早已被革命消灭了。在旧中国，民族资产阶级是同帝国主义、封建势力和官僚资本有矛盾的。他们在资产阶级民主革命中具有两面性：一方面，他们在一定条件下愿意参加反对帝国主义反对国民党反动统治的斗争；另一方面，他们在斗争中又常常表现有一种动摇性和妥协性。在中华人民共和国成立以后，他们表示拥护人民民主专政，拥护共同纲领和宪法，表示愿意继续反对帝国主义，赞成土地改革；但是，他们又有发展资本主义的强烈愿望。因此，我们对待民族资产阶级的政策，同过去一样，仍然是又团结、又斗争、以斗争求团结的政策。这就是说，在工农联盟的基础上，工人阶级还保持着同民族资产阶级在政治上的联盟。在经济上，资本主义工商业具有两方面的作用：一方面具有有利于国计民生的作用，另一方面具有不利于国计民生的作用。因此，国家对于资本主义工商业采取了利用、限制和改造的政策。按照这样的政策，工人阶级又同民族资产阶级建立了经济上的联盟，并且在这种联盟中实现了国营经济对于资本主义经济的领导，使资本主义私有制逐步地经过各种形式的国家资本主义转变为社会主义的全民所有制。
    国家对于资本主义工商业所以必须采取利用的政策，不仅是由于民族资产阶级有接受这个政策的可能性，而且还由于在过渡时期我们在经济上有利用资本主义工商业的必要性。全国解放初期，国民经济遭受了帝国主义和国民党反动统治的严重破坏，我们面对着恢复国民经济的重大任务；同时又由于我国经济很落后，小生产占优势，我们有必要利用一切可以利用的经济力量，以利于国民经济的恢复工作和建设工作。几年来，我们在优先发展国营经济的条件下，实行“公私兼顾、劳资两利”的政策，在原料分配和其他一些问题上对于私营经济基本上给予“一视同仁”的待遇，这就使得私营工厂工人免于失业，同时也使得资本家有一定的利润可得。由于这个政策，对于国计民生有利的资本主义工商业都能维持下来，并且有一些发展。事实证明，资本主义工商业在国民经济的恢复时期和建设时期，对于国营经济在许多方面都起了辅助的作用。对于资本主义工商业实行利用政策，使国家能够取得更多的工业品去换取农民的粮食、工业原料和其他农产品，使国家能够在市场上经常有相当充足的物资，有利于物价的稳定。当然，这种利用政策绝不是让资本主义自由发展。对于资本主义工商业的不利于国计民生的作用，国家必须实行限制的政策，这种限制政策是和利用政策分不开的。
    国家对于资本主义工商业的限制，是同资产阶级一个阶级的狭隘利益冲突的，因此资产阶级中总是有许多人表示反对，或者违反这种限制。限制和反限制的斗争是近几年来我国内部阶级斗争的主要形式，它反映着我国国内主要的阶级矛盾——工人阶级和资产阶级之间的矛盾。从人民共和国成立以来，国家同资本主义的经济，在活动范围方面，在税收方面，在市场价格和加工订货、统购包销、经销代销的条件方面，在工人的劳动条件方面，经常地反复地进行限制和反限制的斗争。其中主要的是一九五○年春天为了稳定物价而反对投机活动的斗争，和一九五二年反对行贿、偷税漏税、盗窃国家资财、偷工减料、盗窃国家经济情报的“五反”斗争。进行这些斗争，是因为有许多资产阶级分子进行了有害于国计民生的非法活动，不能不坚决地加以制止。在进行这些斗争中，我们注意防止和纠正了对于资本主义经济的限制过多过死的错误。党和国家的基本方针，是通过这些斗争使那些坚持不法行为的少数资产阶级分子在人民群众中，同时也在资产阶级队伍内陷于完全的孤立，而把那些愿意服从国家法令的大多数资产阶级分子团结起来。
    国家实行利用政策和限制政策的目的，都是为了对于资本主义工商业实现社会主义的改造。这种改造分为两个步骤：第一步是把资本主义转变为国家资本主义，第二步是把国家资本主义转变为社会主义。在无产阶级执政的国家领导下的国家资本主义是什么呢？正如列宁所说的：“这就是我们能够加以限制，我们能够规定它的界限的一种资本主义。”我们通过国家资本主义这种过渡形式，使民族资产阶级在国家和工人阶级的领导下，有一个必要的时间来逐步地接受改造。在工业方面，由于国家掌握了大部分工业原料，从一九五○年开始对于私营工业采取了供给原料、加工订货和统购包销的办法，从而初步地把私营工业纳入国家资本主义的轨道。到了一九五四年，又进一步地有计划地用公私合营的方式来改造资本主义工业，使主要的大型私营工业企业多数转变为公私合营企业。在商业方面，由于国家经过国营商业和合作社商业掌握了一切重要的农产品和工业品的货源，就有可能按照国家规定的条件把货品批发给私营商业，使私营商业执行经销代销的业务。在一九五四年，这种经销代销的初级形式的国家资本主义商业已经大量地发展起来。有了这些准备以后，到一九五五年秋冬之间，农业合作化的高潮最后地断绝了资本主义在农村发展的道路，从根本上改变了国内阶级力量的对比，资本主义工商业全行业公私合营的条件就完全成熟了。这种全行业公私合营，是我国国家资本主义的最高形式，是使资本主义所有制转变为社会主义公有制的具有决定意义的重大步骤。
    为了通过国家资本主义这种和平过渡的办法来达到社会主义的目的，我们对于资产阶级私有的生产资料的国有化，采取了逐步赎买的政策。在全行业公私合营以前，赎买的形式采取分配利润的制度，即按企业盈余多少，分配一定利润（例如四分之一）给资本家；在全行业公私合营以后，赎买的形式采取定息的制度，即在一定时期内，由国家经过专业公司支付资本家以一定的利息。此外，资方人员凡能工作的都由国家有关部门分配工作，不能工作的也酌量给以安置，或者予以救济，保障他们的生活。这也是一种必要的赎买的办法。马克思和列宁都说过，在一定的历史条件下，无产阶级对于资产阶级采取购买政策是允许的，并且是有利的。这已经在我国的革命实践中得到了证明。
    我们在对资本主义工商业实现社会主义改造的过程中，是把企业的改造和人的改造结合进行的。这就是在企业改造的同时，必须注意采取教育的方法，逐步地改造资本家，使他们由剥削者改造成为自食其力的劳动者。我们对于民族资产阶级采取又团结、又斗争、以斗争求团结的政策，主要是教育他们。对于资本主义经济的限制和对于资产阶级的不法行为的斗争是一种重要的实际的教育。几次调整，统筹兼顾，全面安排，使他们各得其所，这又是一种重要的实际的教育。他们在社会主义改造中采取积极态度的，我们表示欢迎；采取怀疑态度的，我们进行教育并且表示等待；采取反抗态度的，我们进行必要的斗争，而目的还是为了改造他们。这种分别对待的政策，也都是重要的实际的教育。此外，我们还采取演讲、座谈会、学习班、组织资本家和他们的家属进行学习、以及引导资本家内部进行批评和自我批评等等方法，向他们进行教育，解决他们的思想问题。我们这些教育的目的，是要提高他们原来的进步分子，即拥护社会主义改造的分子，使中间分子和落后分子逐步地改变态度向进步分子看齐，分化顽固分子。一句话，团结多数，削弱反抗，以利于社会主义改造。
    国家对于资本主义工商业所实行的利用、限制和改造的政策，以及根据这个政策所采取的每一个步骤，并不是凭主观愿望任意决定的，而是研究了各方面的实际情况和条件，针对国计民生的迫切需要而确定的。这个政策和这些步骤，不但得到了广大群众的拥护，而且资本家也找不出任何一个站得住脚的理由来拒绝或者反对。现在已经可以断定，除开个别的顽固分子还想反抗以外，在经济上接受社会主义改造，并且逐步转变为名副其实的劳动者，是绝大多数民族资产阶级分子能够作到的。
    在农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造过程中，我们的工作并不是没有缺点和错误的，我们的政策并不是一开始就成熟的，在政策的执行中也出现过局部的偏差。但是，改变生产资料私有制为社会主义公有制这个极其复杂和困难的历史任务，现在在我国已经基本上完成了。我国社会主义和资本主义谁战胜谁的问题，现在已经解决了。
    这不是说，我们在社会主义改造方面的任务已经全部完成。在我们的面前还摆着许多迫切的重大的问题。什么是我们今后的任务呢？
    在农业合作化方面，我们还需要继续按照自愿和互利的政策，争取还没有加入合作社的少数农户入社，并且领导那些初级合作社转为高级合作社。但是我们要采取耐心等待的态度，而不允许有任何的强迫命令。目前最急需解决的问题是必须保证现有的一百万个左右合作社尽可能增加生产和增加社员收入。有一部分合作社的成立是比较急促的，还需要迅速处理许多遗留问题，或者还需要调整现有的组织形式。多数合作社还缺少领导几十户、几百户农民进行集体生产的经验，党必须帮助合作社的干部尽可能迅速地取得这种经验。许多合作社过分地强调集体利益和集体经营，错误地忽视了社员个人利益、个人自由和家庭副业，这种错误必须迅速地纠正。为了有效地发扬社员的生产积极性，巩固合作社的组织，必须坚持勤俭办社和民主办社的方针，并且不断地加强对社员的社会主义和集体主义的思想教育。不久以前的个体农民，现在变成了合作社的社员，这是几亿农民生活史上的一个绝大的变化。合作社的干部必须充分认识这个变化，谨慎地担负起社员群众所委托给他们的重大领导职务，全心全意地为社员的利益服务。他们应当了解：只有使社员感觉到自己确实是合作社的主人翁，而且使社员的收入能够每年有所增加，这样的合作社才能够巩固。
    在手工业和其他原来的个体经济的改造工作方面，必须根据各行各业的特点，采取不同的形式，分别地解决各种合作组织在发展中的具体问题。在这里，不顾具体情况，采取千篇一律的形式，是错误的。一部分的合作组织在适当的条件下，将要发展成为国营企业或者并入国营企业；一部分的合作组织将在长时期内保持生产资料的集体所有制；而另一部分的合作组织，则将在社会主义企业的管理下保持各负盈亏的经营方式。各种合作组织都必须注意保持和发展原来的个体经济在生产上和经营上的优良传统。合作化以后，手工业产品的质量必须不降低而要提高，品种必须不减少而要增多。
    在资本主义工商业的改造工作方面，同样地应当按照各行各业的特点和社会经济的多方面的需要，分别地解决它们发展中的具体问题，而不要轻率地作千篇一律的处理，以免造成损失。对于企业中的职工，应当继续进行有系统的教育工作和组织工作，使他们充分了解并执行自己在企业改造方面、生产方面和团结教育资方人员方面的任务，并且选拔职工中间的优秀分子参加企业的管理工作。对于资方人员，应当进行工作上和生活上的安排，建立公私双方人员共同工作的良好关系，并且继续加强对于他们和他们的家属的政治教育。资方人员很多是富有管理经验和技术知识的，他们了解消费者的具体需要，熟悉市场情况，善于精打细算。因此，我们的工作人员除开向他们进行教育以外，还必须认真地向他们学习，把他们的有益的经验和知识当作一份社会遗产继承下来。资本主义工商业的改造，目前还只达到全行业公私合营的阶段。我们必须准备在将来的适当时机，把这些企业变为完全社会主义的国营企业。
    只有在完成以上所说的各方面的任务以后，我们才彻底地解决了我国的社会主义改造问题。我们相信，我们党一定能够继续同全国人民一起，在不长的时间内胜利地完成这些任务，使我国的社会主义建设得到最有利的发展条件。（三）社会主义建设第一个五年计划的执行情况和第二个五年计划的准备
    我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划，已经实行了三年又八个半月。到明年，我国将完成第一个五年计划，并且编制一九五八年到一九六二年的第二个五年计划。我们党和全国人民当前的中心任务，就是争取超额完成第一个五年计划和积极准备第二个五年计划。
    第一个五年计划的执行已经得到了巨大的成就，甚至我们的敌人也不能否认这种成就了。
    我们大力发展了工业的基本建设工作。在过去几年内，我们已经扩建了东北钢铁工业基地，开始了内蒙古、华中两个新的钢铁工业基地的建设，新建和扩建了一系列的电站、煤矿、油井，一系列的有色金属厂矿、化学工厂、建筑材料工厂，一系列的机器制造厂，一系列的轻工业工厂。第一个五年计划规定限额以上的工业建设项目，施工六百九十四个，完工四百五十五个。实际上，施工的项目将达到八百个左右，而可以完工的项目则将接近五百个。在计划规定的五年基本建设投资总额四百二十七亿元中，前三年所完成的和今年计划完成的已经达到三百五十五亿元，占计划数百分之八十三。
    第一个五年计划规定，工业总产值在五年内增长百分之九十点三，这个规定将超额完成。今年年度计划中的工业总产值，已经达到了原计划的一九五七年的指标，而钢、钢材、金属切削机床、水泥、汽车轮胎、棉纱、棉布、纸张等项，今年的计划产量，都已经超过了原计划的一九五七年的指标。由于重工业的发展，我国现在已经开始制造载重汽车、喷气式飞机、六千瓩至一万二千瓩的发电设备等等。我国经济建设所需要的机器设备，到一九五七年将有百分之六十左右可以自给。
    我国的农业，在总产值方面和主要的粮食作物、经济作物方面，也有可能超额完成第一个五年计划。农业和副业的总产值，计划规定一九五七年比一九五二年增长百分之二十三点三。在一九五三和一九五四两年都因为严重的自然灾害，增长很少，但是在一九五五年已经比一九五二年增长百分之十四点八。今年我国虽然又有比较严重的水灾、旱灾和风灾，但是，在合作化的基础上，粮食产量还是可能达到原计划一九五七年的水平。
    在水利方面，我国过去三年内，在淮河流域、长江中游和其他许多河流上进行了一系列的建设。黄河的三门峡水利枢纽工程，已经进行了施工前一系列的准备工作。此外，各地农村还兴修了大量的小型水利工程。
    在运输方面，第一个五年计划规定建设铁路新线四千余公里，今年将超额完成。计划规定新建公路干线一万公里，今年也可以超额完成。
    在国内贸易和对外贸易方面，在文化教育卫生事业方面，也都有迅速的发展。
    职工的生活有了初步的改善。预计今年，全国职工的平均工资将比一九五二年增长百分之三十三点五。国家和企业每年实际开支的劳动保险费、职工医疗费、职工文教费和职工福利费，共约占每年工资总额的百分之十三左右，四年总计约四十四亿元。国家在过去三年中修建的和今年计划修建的职工宿舍共达五千几百万平方公尺。
    应当指出，第一个五年计划中有个别的指标，例如石油原油、食用植物油、卷烟的产量，由于客观情况的限制，将不能完成计划。但是整个说来，第一个五年计划可以超额完成。
    我们第一个五年计划的基本建设的投资总额和工程项目，虽然有可能超额完成，但是某些重大建设单位的部分工程，要完成预定的任务，却还必须适当地集中必要的财力和物力，作紧张的努力。对于其他限额以上的工程也要争取尽量地完成预定计划。
    各个重工业部门虽然已经超额完成了生产任务，但是为了保证基本建设计划能够更好地完成，我们必须努力生产更多的钢铁、机器设备和建筑材料，必须相应地增多煤、电、石油、有色金属和化学制品等等的生产。同时，还应当相应地解决运输和城市建设等问题。
    在农业方面，必须进行严重的努力。粮食、棉花必须力求继续增产。油料作物、猪和其他牲畜、有些副业产品在过去几年中增产不快，有的甚至一度下降，必须由农业和商业部门采取有效措施，促进它们的尽速增产。
    我们完成第一个五年计划以后，就将紧接着执行第二个五年计划。因此，在这次大会上，我们要讨论和通过我们党关于第二个五年计划的建议。关于这个建议，周恩来同志将代表党中央委员会作专门的报告。
    什么是第二个五年计划的基本任务呢？
    党中央委员会认为，为了满足我国社会主义扩大再生产的需要，完成社会主义工业化的任务，为了加强社会主义阵营各国之间的国际协作，促进社会主义各国经济的共同高涨，根据我国人口众多、资源丰富的条件，我们应当在三个五年计划的时期内，基本上建成一个完整的工业体系。按照这个方向，第二个五年计划的基本任务，简单地说来，就是：（1）继续进行以重工业为中心的工业建设，推进国民经济的技术改造，建立我国社会主义工业化的巩固基础；（2）继续完成社会主义改造，巩固和扩大集体所有制和全民所有制；（3）在发展基本建设和继续完成社会主义改造的基础上，进一步地发展工业、农业、手工业的生产，相应地发展运输业和商业；（4）努力培养建设人材，加强科学研究工作，以适应社会主义经济文化发展的需要；（5）在工业农业生产发展的基础上增强国防力量，提高人民的物质生活和文化生活的水平。
    在第一个五年计划期间，我们一般地还不能够自己制造重型的和精密的机器，因而自己不能供给很多重点工程的主要设备。我国生产的钢材在数量上和品种上也不能满足需要，许多种高级合金钢还不能制造，有色金属工业的产品种类很少，无线电工业还很薄弱，有机合成化学工业还几乎没有。在第二个五年内，我们应当努力建设上述薄弱的和缺少的项目，争取在一九六二年我国经济建设所需要的机器设备可以有百分之七十左右能够自给，其中将有部分重型的和精密的机器。在燃料方面，石油的产量特别落后于需要，我们必须逐步改善这种情况。
    在第二个五年计划期间，需要以更大的规模进行地质勘探工作，来发现种类更多和数量更多的地下资源，并且以更大的规模进行基本建设工作。在第二个五年内，基本建设的投资额将比第一个五年增加一倍左右。除开继续建设东北、华中、内蒙古的钢铁工业基地以外，将在三门峡周围地区、甘肃青海地区、新疆地区、西南地区建设新的工业基地。在第二个五年的基本建设计划完成以后，全国很多的机器制造工厂、冶金工厂、电站、煤矿、石油企业、化学工厂、建筑材料工厂，将拥有现代先进技术的装备。
    重工业各部门的生产需要大大提高。在一九六二年，需要把钢的产量由一九五七年的原定计划数四百一十二万吨增加到一千零五十万至一千二百万吨，煤的产量由一亿一千三百万吨增加到一亿九千万至二亿一千万吨，电的产量由一百五十九亿度增加到四百至四百三十亿度。
    轻工业也需要有比较快的发展。在一九六二年，要求棉纱由一九五七年的原定计划数五百万件增加到八百至九百万件，食用植物油由一百七十九万吨增加到三百一十至三百二十万吨，糖由一百一十万吨增加到二百四十至二百五十万吨，机制纸由六十五万吨增加到一百五十至一百六十万吨。
    为了适应整个国民经济的需要，第二个五年计划应当按照一九五六年到一九六七年全国农业发展纲要（草案）所指出的方向，把农业提到更高的水平。在一九六二年，要求生产粮食五千亿斤左右，棉花四千八百万担左右，并且应当力争超过这两个指标。养猪要求达到二亿五千万只左右。大豆、油料、糖料、其他经济作物和副业产品，也必须积极发展。
    铁路、公路、水运等项运输事业以及电讯事业都需要继续发展。对于原有线路应当逐步地进行必要的技术改造，继续合理地组织运输，充分发挥现有运输设备的潜力。现在的铁路运输已经在某些地方呈现紧张情况，必须积极改善。在第二个五年内，要求新建铁路八千至九千公里，把兰新铁路修到中苏边境，把西北、西南各省用铁路干线联接起来。
    为了增加材料和设备的新品种，应当充分动员我国的技术力量，努力加强产品的设计和研究的工作，进行新产品的生产。轻视自己的技术力量，不去积极使用它和培养它，是不对的。
    按照初步的计算，要求第二个五年计划期末国民收入要比第一个五年计划期末增长百分之五十左右。除了增加国家的积累以外，人民的生活将得到相当的改善。五年内，职工人数将增加六百万人至七百万人左右；工人职员的平均工资将增加百分之二十五至三十；农民的全部收入也将增加百分之二十五至三十；粮食、棉布和其他重要消费品如食油、食糖、煤油、煤炭等的供应，都将有所增长。
    从以上所说的简单轮廓可以看出，党关于第二个五年计划的建议，预示着我国国民经济的巨大而迅速的进展。按照这个建议，第二个五年计划的实现，将为我国在第三个五年计划期间基本上完成过渡时期总任务准备好必要的条件。
    党中央委员会所建议的第二个五年计划的发展速度是积极的，同时又是稳妥可靠的。发展速度必须是积极的，以免丧失时机，陷入保守主义的错误；又必须是稳妥可靠的，以免脱离经济发展的正确比例，使人民的负担过重，或者使不同的部门互相脱节，使计划不能完成，徒然造成浪费，那就是冒险主义的错误。
    很明显，第二个五年计划要求比第一个五年计划有更大的投资。我国的国民经济发展了，我国的财政状况也随着有了改进。但是必须看到，我们的资金仍然是有限的，我们必须最有效、最节约地使用资金。增加建设费用的一个重要方法就是进一步节减军政费用。党中央在一九五○年已经确定了这个方针，但是由于抗美援朝战争的发生，这个方针没有能够早日实现。虽然近年我国已经努力节减军政费用，但是，在第一个五年国家财政支出中，估计国防费用和行政费用仍将占国家财政支出的百分之三十二，经济文化建设支出共约占百分之五十六。在第二个五年中，必须使军政费用的比重下降到百分之二十左右，使经济文化建设支出的比重提高到百分之六十至七十。在经济文化建设中，也必须适当地集中使用资金。因此，国民经济的技术改造，在第二个五年内必须首先集中在重工业特别是机器制造工业和冶金工业方面。同时，在一切企业中，在一切国家机关中，在整个社会生活中，都必须继续提倡节约，克服浪费。浪费在任何时候都是妨碍生产的发展和生活的改善的。我们的建设还在开始，我们更应当为积累每一元的建设资金并且加以最有效的使用而奋斗。我们的一部分消费物资必须出口，以便换来工业建设所需要的机器装备。为了将来的幸福，我们不能不暂时忍受一些生活上的困难。勤俭建国、勤俭办企业、勤俭办合作社、勤俭办一切事业，这是我们党建设社会主义的长远方针，这也是拟定和执行第二个五年计划所必须遵循的方针。
    以下，我们将就工业、农业、商业、文化教育四个方面，概括地讨论一下我们在过去几年中所取得的一些经验。
                工　业
    在工业方面，这里只讲几个比较重要的问题，就是重工业和轻工业的关系问题，工业的布局问题，产品和工程的质量问题，职工生活问题，企业领导问题。
    我国的工业化事业是以发展重工业的生产，即生产资料工业的生产为基础的。在旧中国，生产资料工业的产值在全部工业产值中所占的比重很低，在一九四九年，只占百分之二十六点六。这是中国生产力落后的标志。我们党所实行的社会主义工业化的政策，要求根本改变这种状况，保证优先发展生产资料工业的生产。在一九五二年，生产资料工业的产值约占我国全部工业产值的百分之三十五点六，而到了第一个五年计划期末，这个比例有可能上升到百分之四十以上。
    为了有计划地发展国民经济，我们在今后必须继续贯彻执行优先发展重工业的政策。有些同志想把重工业发展的速度降低，这种想法是错误的。试问：如果我们不很快地建立起自己的必要的机器制造工业、冶金工业以及其他有关的重工业，我们用什么东西去装备轻工业、运输业、建筑业和农业呢？我们就将得不到必要的各种机器，得不到必要的钢材和水泥，得不到必要的电力和燃料，我们的国民经济就将长时期陷于落后的境地。很明显，我们决不能那样办。
    但是也有这样的同志，他们片面地强调发展重工业的意义，他们想降低轻工业和其他经济部门的发展速度，这种想法也是错误的。他们不了解：第一，人民对于消费品的需要既然日益增长，如果不相应地发展轻工业，就可能出现商品不足的情况，就将影响物价和市场的稳定。特别是在农村中，如果没有足够数量的工业产品以稳定的合理的价格去交换农产品，就可能妨碍工农联盟的巩固，并且可能影响农业生产的发展。第二，轻工业需要的投资比较少，企业建设的时间比较短，资金的周转比较快，所以资金的积累也比较快，而轻工业所积累起来的资金也正可以用来帮助重工业的发展。由此可见，在资金、原料、市场所允许的范围内，适当地注意发展轻工业，对于建设重工业不但无害，而且有利。
    在工业的布局问题上，目前需要注意的是沿海和内地的配合，大型企业和中小型企业的配合，中央国营企业和地方国营企业的配合。
    为了合理地布置生产力，使工业企业接近自然资源，使工业和整个国民经济得到平衡的发展，我国在第一个五年计划期间已经把工业重点逐步移向内地，正在改变着解放前百分之七十以上的工业集中在沿海各省的畸形现象。但是这决不是说可以否认或者忽视沿海各省工业的作用。我们应当充分利用沿海各省的有利条件，继续适当地发展那里的工业，以帮助内地工业的发展，加速全国的工业化。在第一个五年计划期间，辽宁、上海、天津等工业区已经发挥了显著的作用。在第二个五年内，除开充分利用东北和华东的工业基地以外，还必须合理地发挥河北、山东地区和华南地区在发展工业上的作用。
    在第二个五年内，为了配合大型企业的建设和生产，为了加速工业的发展，加强工业的协作，增加产品的品种，为了便于充分利用资源，充分利用原有企业，特别是大量的公私合营企业，必须在建设大型企业的同时，有计划地新建和改建中小型企业。
    必须注意把中央各经济部门的积极性和地方经济组织的积极性正确地结合起来。在过去，一方面，有些中央部门对于地方工业的发展和统一安排注意得不够，以致地方工业不能够合理地发挥潜在力量；另一方面，有些地方领导机关也曾经不顾全国生产设备是否有余，不顾当地的资源条件和其他经济条件，盲目地新建和扩建一些工业，因而也造成了国家的损失。这两种偏向都必须纠正。
    为了完成国家的生产计划，无论轻工业或者重工业，无论地方国营企业或者中央国营企业，都必须努力提高产品的质量。同样，为了完成国家的建设计划，工业、运输业以及其他一切部门的基本建设单位，都必须努力提高工程的质量。这是我国社会主义建设事业中最迫切的问题之一。
    社会主义的优越性，不但要表现在我们的经济成就的数量和进度上面，还必须表现在它的质量上面。我们已经生产了许多质量优良的重工业产品和轻工业产品，建成了许多质量优良的工程。但是由于一部分企业的设备落后和技术水平不高，一部分企业缺乏产品标准和工艺规程，一部分企业没有建立严格的质量检查和技术监督的制度，特别是一部分企业的领导机关没有充分地重视保证产品和工程的质量，只是片面地重视保证数量和进度，所以有许多产品和工程的质量是不好的，某些产品不合规格，成为次货。商业方面统购包销制度所产生的副作用和执行这个制度所发生的缺点，以及在私营工商业改造过程中曾经一度发生的某些混乱现象，也降低了许多轻工业企业对于产品质量的责任心，甚至造成了许多产品质量下降的严重情况。这些情况已经给国家和人民带来损失，必须迅速地加以扭转。一切技术水平不高和设备落后的企业必须采取有效措施，争取在短期内熟练地掌握有关的技术，并且逐步地改善设备落后的状况。一切企业都要定出合理的产品标准和工艺规程。一切检查制度不严的厂矿和工地，必须迅速建立质量检查和技术监督的机构和制度。对于不合标准的产品和不合规格的工程应当定出适当的处理办法，应当积极地改善原料、材料的质量和原料、材料的供应工作。对于轻工业产品，应当严格地执行按质分等论价的政策，并且在一部分产品中逐步地推行选购制度。尤其重要的，必须在一切有关的工人和职员中进行关于保证质量、提高质量的思想教育，彻底地纠正那些对于质量不负责任的错误观点。
    在发展生产的基础上逐步地改善职工生活，对于提高广大职工群众的积极性，具有重大的作用。为了改善职工生活，需要解决那些问题呢？首先，应当保证职工的工资收入在生产发展的基础上逐步增加，并且继续贯彻执行按劳取酬的原则，改进工资制度和奖励制度。第二，应当切实加强对于生产的安全措施和劳动保护工作。第三，应当努力保证和改善副食品的供应工作。第四，应当逐步增加职工的福利设施，积极设法解决职工急需的住宅和其他的困难。第五，应当保证职工有时间料理家庭的生活，得到应有的休息。
    职工群众有许多困难不是短时间内可以解决的，只有在社会主义建设得到更大的发展以后才能解决。我们还需要艰苦奋斗，不应当只管个人利益和目前利益，而忽视全国的和长远的利益。这一点必须向职工群众说明。但是，在另一方面，片面地强调全国的和长远的利益，而忽视职工的个人利益和目前利益，也是不对的。目前职工生活中的有些问题是必须解决而且是可能解决的，其所以没有解决，只是因为企业的领导者、工会组织和有关主管部门没有积极努力。我们必须坚决反对这种不关心群众痛痒的官僚主义态度。
    处理职工生活问题的上述原则，适用于一切企业的职工和国家机关的公务人员。
    职工群众的积极性能不能发扬，在很大程度上决定于企业的领导制度和领导工作是不是健全。企业的健全的领导应当是怎样的呢？
    在企业中，应当建立以党为核心的集体领导和个人负责相结合的领导制度。凡是重大的问题都应当经过集体讨论和共同决定，凡是日常的工作都应当由专人分工负责。企业的领导者，企业中的党组织、行政组织、工会组织和青年团组织，都应当善于把企业的当前任务向群众解释清楚，善于发动群众开展社会主义竞赛和先进生产者运动，提出合理化建议，不断地改进工作。企业中各方面的领导骨干，都应当善于深入群众，同群众打成一片，了解群众的情绪和要求，积极帮助群众解决困难。
    企业领导工作的改进，不仅需要企业本身的努力，而且需要上级国家机关的努力。在这里，有必要指出这样一个事实，就是上级国家机关往往对于企业管得过多、过死，妨碍了企业应有的主动性和机动性，使工作受到不应有的损失。应当保证企业在国家的统一领导和统一计划下，在计划管理、财务管理、干部管理、职工调配、福利设施等方面，有适当的自治权利。这并不是说，上级国家机关的领导需要减弱。恰恰相反，许多上级机关并没有真正深入企业，它们对于企业的领导往往是不及时和不具体的。我们的经济部门的领导机关必须认真把该管的事管好，而不要去管那些可以不管或者不该管的事。只有上级国家机关的强有力的领导同企业本身的积极性互相结合，才能把我们的事业迅速地推向前进。
                农　业
    第二个五年计划的建议，在农业生产的增长和农民收入的增加方面提出了巨大的任务。应当怎样完成这些任务呢？
    我们是在没有农业机器的条件下实现农业合作化的。我国的农业，只能随着国家工业化的发展，根据不同地区的不同耕作条件，适当地逐步地实现农业机械化。在第二个五年计划期末，机耕面积，预计只占全国耕地面积的十分之一。计划增加的耕地面积，同第一个五年一样，只能达到几千万亩，即近于全国原有耕地面积的二十分之一。化学肥料的产量，到一九六二年，每亩播种面积平均还摊不到三斤。因此，在第二个五年内，农业增产的主要方法，仍然是依靠农业合作社和农民群众采用兴修水利、增施肥料、改良土壤、改良品种、推广新式农具、提高复种指数、改进耕作方法、防治病虫灾害等项措施，来提高单位面积产量。
    应当看到，依靠这些措施，实现农业增产的潜力是巨大的。例如在水利方面，现有的灌溉面积只占全国耕地面积三分之一，在其余三分之二的耕地中，有许多是可以找到水源灌溉的。在肥料方面，人畜粪尿和绿肥等自然肥料，来源很丰富，肥效也高，现在还有不少地方是没有充分利用这些肥源的。我国农村有丰富的人力，而且在农业合作化的基础上组织起来了。只要正确地坚持不懈地推行上述措施，完成建议中的第二个五年的增产指标是完全可能的。
    在第二个五年内，保证粮食和棉花的增产，仍然是一项非常重要的任务。同时，保证其他经济作物、畜牧业和副业产品的增产，也是一项重要的任务。根据统计，除去自给性的副业不计外，各种经济作物、畜产品和副业产品的产值，在全国农业产值中约占百分之五十左右，接近甚至超过粮食所占的比重，因而对于农民收入有极大的重要性。而这些经济作物、畜产品和副业产品，对于轻工业、人民副食品和出口贸易的供应，又有极大的意义。拿养猪来说，我们在第二个五年内要求把养猪的数字从一九五七年的计划数一亿三千八百万只增加到一九六二年的二亿五千万只左右，就是因为养猪关系到全国城乡的肉食、农作物的肥料、猪肉猪鬃的出口，非大力发展不可。因此，各个地方的党组织、政府和它的农业部门必须切实加强对于经济作物、畜牧业和副业的领导。应当按照本地方和国家的需要，在中央和地方的计划指导之下，帮助每个农业生产合作社制定适合于自己情况的发展粮食生产、经济作物生产、畜牧业生产、副业生产的全面计划。在发展副业生产的问题上，应当照顾到合作社集体经营和社员家庭经营的必要的分工，使两方面的积极性都得到合理的发挥。目前，有许多合作社比较忽视甚至不合理地限制社员经营家庭副业，这种偏向应当纠正。
    为了促进经济作物、畜牧业和副业的发展，必须实行正确的价格政策。从人民共和国成立以来，我们的价格政策，一般地是适当的，是照顾到农民的利益的，但是，在执行中也犯了一些错误。几年来，某些经济作物、养猪业和其他副业的发展不快或者减产，部分地就是由于这些产品的收购价格有些偏低。这些偏低的收购价格，应当在经过调查研究以后及时地加以适当的调整。
    保证农业生产发展的一个重大问题，是必须保证农民在生产发展的条件下能够增加收入。党中央要求全国的合作社，在初办的几年内，在正常年景的情况下，争取百分之九十的社员增加收入，而以后，在发展生产的基础上，一般社员都可以逐年增加收入。为此，不但需要国家有正确的税收政策和价格政策，而且需要合作社正确地规定公共积累和社员个人收入的比例。合作社不应当任意增加生产费用、管理费用、公积金、公益金的数量；国家的税收也应当保持在一个适当的比例上。我们应当坚持兼顾国家利益、集体利益和个人利益的分配政策。
                商　业
    同工业和农业的发展相适应，国内贸易和对外贸易在第一个五年计划期间得到了显著的成就。在国内贸易方面，社会商品零售额按今年的计划将比一九五二年增长百分之六十六点三。在过去几年中，我们保持了物价的稳定，发展了城乡的物资交流，供应了人民的需要。在对外贸易方面，今年的进出口总值将比一九五二年增长百分之六十五。在全国解放以前，我国的进口商品是以生活资料为主的；一九五○年以来，在进口商品中生产资料已占百分之九十以上。我国的对外贸易保证了国家建设事业对设备和器材的需要，并且发展了我国同苏联、各人民民主国家以及其他国家的经济合作和友好关系。
    第二个五年计划期间，在国民经济进一步发展的基础上，按照初步的估算，国内社会商品零售额一九六二年将比一九五七年增长百分之五十左右，对外贸易进出口总值也将有很大的增长。
    由于私营商业的社会主义改造已经在基本上完成，统一的社会主义的市场已经形成，社会主义商业现在在整个国民经济中起着极其重要的作用。工业产品中的消费品和一部分生产资料，农业产品中的商品部分，都要经过社会主义商业分配给工业生产部门、农业生产合作社和广大的消费群众。由于人民购买力的增长，由于人民对消费品特别是副食品的需要的增长，由于农业合作化和工业建设的迅速发展，由于对外贸易对于出口物资的要求愈来愈多，今后我国商业工作的任务将更加繁重。商业部门必须根据人民群众和对外出口的需要，通过价格政策和采购措施来推动工业和农业增加产量，改善质量；必须进一步发展商业网，扩大商品流通，加强对于工业品、农产品的采购和供应，并且使商业网的安排，适应于商品采购的需要和群众购买的方便。
    商业的进一步发展，特别要求在目前认真地改进购销关系，正确地掌握物价政策和适当地调整某些商品的价格。
    在利用、限制、改造资本主义企业时期所采取的许多关于购销关系的措施，现在必须改变，代之以适合于目前经济情况的措施。在资本主义工商业实行全行业公私合营以前，我们的国营商业曾经对于资本主义工业的产品实行加工定货、统购包销；对于农产品，除开粮食、棉花、油料由国家实行统购以外，其余的大部分或者委托供销合作社统一收购，或者由国营商业直接收购；对于城市和集镇的市场，实行了严格的管理，统一议定商品价格，并且限制了某些私商贩运活动的范围。这些措施在当时是必要的，收到了成效的。但是这些措施的执行，也产生了某些副作用，这就是前面说的，一部分工业品质量下降，品种减少，一部分农产品和副业产品减产，一部分物资交流受到了妨碍。现在必须克服这些缺点。我们应当改进现行的市场管理办法，取消过严过死的限制；并且应当在统一的社会主义市场的一定范围内，允许国家领导下的自由市场的存在和一定程度的发展，作为国家市场的补充。
    全国解放以前，我国经过了十二年严重的通货膨胀，物价经常波动。解放以后，针对这种情况，党的基本方针是稳定物价。这就是说，不管当时某些物价是否合理，首先使各种物价在当时的水平上稳定下来，而在稳定以后，再对某些十分不合理的价格进行若干调整。党的这个基本方针是正确的，执行这个方针的结果是成功的，它对我国工业农业生产的发展起了有益的促进作用。但是我们在物价政策的执行方面也有不少的错误和缺点。商业部门应当总结过去的经验，在继续执行稳定物价的方针下，拟出一套适合于目前具体情况而有利于工农业生产的比较完整的价格政策和价格方案。收购价格的规定，必须达到有利于增产的目的，这是我们物价政策的一个重要原则。为了提高工农业产品的质量，在收购和销售两方面，都必须实行按质分等论价的政策。对于当地收购、当地销售的商品，收销差价过大的，应当适当地缩小；而对于低值的小商品的批零差价，应当适当地扩大。此外，还必须严格禁止违反国家的物价政策而寻求不应有的商业利润的行为。
    商业工作的巨大的任务，要求全国的商业工作人员进一步学会做生意。我们必须认真地总结我国商业所积累的一切有用的经验，必须有计划地培养商业工作的干部和专家，把我国的社会主义商业提到更高的水平。
            文化教育
    文化教育事业在整个社会主义建设事业中占有重要的地位。我国的文化教育事业在过去几年中已经有了巨大的进步。拿一九四九年同今年计划相比，高等学校的学生数从十一万六千人增加到三十八万人，中等学校的学生数从一百二十六万八千人增加到五百八十六万人，小学生数从二千四百三十九万人增加到五千七百七十几万人。图书出版数已经由解放初期的一亿多册增加到今年的十六亿册。医疗机构的床位数已经从解放初期的十万○六千张增加到今年的三十三万九千张。
    第二个五年计划要求高等学校学生增加一倍左右，中等专业学校、高级中学和初级中学的学生也有相应的增加。第二个五年计划要求特别加强专门人才的培养和科学研究的发展，以便积极掌握世界各国的最新科学成就。我国的科学家们已经初步拟定了一个一九五六年至一九六七年的科学发展规划，这个规划要求我国的一些对国民经济关系重要的科学技术部门，在十二年左右接近世界的先进水平。我们应当坚决支持各个科学研究机关和高等学校同心协力地实现这个愿望。
    为了繁荣我国的科学和艺术，使它们为社会主义建设服务，党中央提出了“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针。科学上的真理是愈辩愈明的，艺术上的风格是必须兼容并包的。党对于学术性质和艺术性质的问题，不应当依靠行政命令来实现自己的领导，而要提倡自由讨论和自由竞赛来推动科学和艺术的发展。为了实现我国的文化革命，必须用极大的努力逐步扫除文盲，并且在财政力量许可的范围内，逐步地扩大小学教育，以求在十二年内分区分期地普及小学义务教育。同时，对于职工的文化教育和技术教育，对于一部分文化程度很低的机关工作人员的文化教育，也必须继续加强。对于没有文字的少数民族，应当帮助他们创造文字。
    我们要用社会主义的、马克思列宁主义的思想去武装知识分子和人民群众，对封建主义的、资本主义的思想进行批判。在过去几年中，我们已经在这一方面进行了大规模的工作，这一工作对于我国社会主义改造事业的胜利起了伟大的作用。但是大家知道，改造旧的思想意识比改造旧的生产关系更困难些，更需要时间。我们必须继续加强思想战线上的工作。在我们对于封建主义和资本主义的思想体系进行批判的时候，我们对于旧时代有益于人民的文化遗产，必须谨慎地加以继承。
    要完成文化教育工作各方面的任务，必须进一步扩大和加强知识分子的队伍。我们必须经过学校教育和在职干部的业余教育，大量培养新的知识分子，特别是从劳动阶级出身的知识分子。同时，我们必须运用资产阶级和小资产阶级的知识分子的力量来建设社会主义，并且要向他们学习。但是，我们不应当让他们所带来的资产阶级思想和小资产阶级思想侵蚀无产阶级的队伍，相反，我们要尽一切努力帮助他们转变为同劳动人民密切结合的新知识分子。由于我们党做了长期的有系统的工作，我国知识分子的基本队伍已经同工人农民结成了亲密的联盟，并且有相当数量的知识分子变成了共产主义者，加入了我们的党。在今后，我们的任务就是要继续贯彻执行团结、教育、改造知识分子的政策，改善对于知识分子的使用，使他们更有效地为祖国的伟大建设事业服务。
    （四）国家的政治生活
    革命的根本问题是政权问题。我们为什么能够在仅仅七年的时间内根本改变我们祖国的面貌，在社会主义改造和社会主义建设方面获得如此巨大的成就呢？这难道不是因为我们领导工人阶级和广大的人民群众取得了全国的政权的原故吗？这难道不是因为我们的政权是一种完全新式的政权——人民民主专政的政权的原故吗？
    为了大大地发展我国的已经开始的社会主义建设，并且彻底完成社会主义改造，我们必须继续加强人民民主专政，继续改进国家工作。
    我们所建立的国家，同一切其他的社会主义国家一样，是人类历史上最民主、最有效率、最巩固的国家。中华人民共和国的成立，使几亿被侮辱被损害的饥寒交迫的奴隶升到了主人翁的地位，使他们的生活和自由得到保障，使劳动得到光荣，使妇女得到平等的地位。大批优秀的工人、农民、妇女、青年参加了国家管理工作，把我们的国家机关建设成为勤勉的、廉洁的、为人民服务的国家机关。我们的国家实现了空前未有的统一。由于民主改革的彻底完成和镇压反革命的胜利，由于社会主义改造的成就和社会主义建设的发展，还由于人民政府的其他一系列的措施，在我们的社会上出现了空前未有的安定。
    世界上一切国家的实质都是阶级的专政，问题只是什么阶级对什么阶级专政。一切地主阶级、资产阶级的国家都是少数人统治多数人、剥削者统治劳动人民的工具。俄国十月革命的伟大功绩，就是它首先把这种情况颠倒过来，使国家成为多数人统治少数人、劳动人民统治剥削者的工具。尽管我国的革命有自己的许多特点，可是中国共产党人把自己所干的事业看成是伟大的十月革命的继续。我们的人民民主专政就是以工人阶级为首的人民大众对于反动阶级、反动派和反抗社会主义革命的剥削者的专政。我们的民主不是属于少数人的，而是属于绝大多数人的，是属于工人、农民和其他一切劳动人民以及一切拥护社会主义和爱国的人民的。
    我国的人民民主专政经历了资产阶级民主革命和社会主义革命两个时期。当资产阶级民主革命在全国胜利以前，在革命根据地已经建立了人民民主专政，这种专政是解决资产阶级民主革命任务的，因为它只是实行了对于封建土地制度的变革，并不改变民族资产阶级的生产资料所有制，也不改变农民的个体所有制。在中华人民共和国成立以后，人民民主专政开始担负由资本主义过渡到社会主义的任务，就是说，要把资产阶级和小生产者的生产资料的私有制改变为社会主义的公有制，彻底消灭人剥削人的制度。这样的政权实质上只能是无产阶级专政。只有无产阶级经过自己的先锋队中国共产党，毫无阻碍地运用政权这个武器，把全体劳动人民和其他可以接受社会主义的力量紧密地团结在自己的周围，共同执行无产阶级的政策路线，一方面，组织向社会主义过渡的经济文化生活，另一方面，镇压反动阶级和反动派的反抗，防御外国帝国主义的干涉，才能够实现这样严重复杂的任务。
    事情很明显：如果在资产阶级民主革命的阶段，我国的农民和民族资产阶级离开了无产阶级的领导尚且不能够取得胜利，那么，在社会主义革命阶段，除开无产阶级以外，还有别的什么社会力量能够负起这种领导责任呢？要是没有无产阶级的坚定的、有远见的和大公无私的领导，就是贫苦的农民也不可能走上真正社会主义的道路，更不必说本性同社会主义完全相反的资产阶级了。我国资产阶级能够锣鼓喧天地接受社会主义改造，这个奇迹正是说明了无产阶级的正确领导的伟大力量，正是说明了无产阶级专政的绝对必要。
    人们会问：既然我国现阶段的人民民主专政实质上是无产阶级专政的一种形式，那么，为什么又有其他阶级、其他党派和无党派民主人士参加政权呢？我国的人民民主统一战线为什么还要继续存在呢？
    要知道：无产阶级专政不但需要无产阶级对于国家机关的坚强领导，而且需要最广大的人民群众对于国家机关的积极参加，二者缺一不可。无产阶级只有同广大的可以接受社会主义的群众结成联盟，才能形成最大多数人对于反动阶级的专政，才能实现社会主义，这难道不是异常清楚的道理吗？列宁说：“无产阶级专政，是无产阶级，即劳动者先锋队与人数众多的非无产者劳动阶层（小资产阶级，小业主，农民，知识界等等），或与大多数劳动者建立的特式阶级联盟，……是为最终建成并巩固社会主义而建立的联盟。”列宁所说的阶级联盟的范围，在不同的历史条件下是可以不一样的，但是，无产阶级专政总是一定形式的阶级联盟，这一点是无可怀疑的。
    工农联盟是我们的人民民主专政和人民民主统一战线的基础。农民占我国人口的百分之八十以上，离开了同农民的联盟就谈不到实现社会主义。我们党在长期的革命斗争中已经同农民建立了血肉般的联系。从人民共和国成立以来，无论在土地改革工作中，在互助合作运动中，在农业生产和农村经济文化事业的领导中，在税收政策、粮食政策、物价政策的制定和执行中，我们都注意了继续加强这种联系。农民在我国政治生活中占着应有的重要地位。在全国广大农村的国家机关中工作的，几乎全部是农民。但是应当说，在我们的工作中，对于农民的具体利益重视不够的缺点还是不少的。在农业合作化以后，工农联盟进到了一个新的更高的阶段。但是在同时，许多党组织和国家机关由于过高地估计目前农业合作社的经济能力和滥用合作化所产生的“便利”，在农村工作中的命令主义倾向又有了新的发展。为了继续巩固工农联盟，我们必须坚决克服这些缺点。
    对于农民的政策，同样适用于其他的新近参加了各种合作组织的手工业者、小商小贩和其他个体劳动者。他们在我国也是一个重要的社会阶层，由于他们的居住和经济活动都比较分散，我们过去在他们中间的工作也比较薄弱。现在他们组织起来了，他们需要解决许多迫切的问题。我们必须采取有效的办法加强同他们的联系，使他们的经济利益和政治利益得到应有的重视。
    在我国的人民民主专政和人民民主统一战线中，民族资产阶级具有一种特殊的地位。在抗日战争期间，革命根据地的政权机关已经吸收民族资产阶级的某些代表人物参加。但是那是在资产阶级民主革命阶段，因而是比较容易了解的。在人民共和国成立以后，民族资产阶级和它的党派有更多的代表人物参加了我国的无产阶级专政性质的国家机关，并且同工人阶级和共产党在社会主义事业中继续保持政治上的联盟。这是为什么呢？这种联盟在社会主义改造已经取得基本胜利的今天还有什么意义呢？这一切难道不是一种负担吗？
    诚然，我国的民族资产阶级，包括大中小资本家和资产阶级的知识分子在内，是我国社会上除了官僚资产阶级以外人数最少的一个阶级，并且在政治上和经济上都有很大的软弱性。但是不论在过去和现在，这个阶级在我国社会上都有很大的影响和作用。这是因为他们在历史上发展了近代工业，领导过旧民主主义革命，在一定程度上参加了新民主主义革命，并且在中华人民共和国成立以后的具体条件下，表示愿意接受工人阶级和共产党的领导，又逐步地愿意接受社会主义改造。这是因为他们比较早地掌握了现代的文化，并且掌握了一些现代企业的技术知识和管理知识；直到现在，他们仍然是我国具有比较丰富的现代文化知识、拥有比较多的知识分子和专家的一个阶级。在过去几年内，民族资产阶级参加了国民经济的恢复工作，还参加了或者支持了土地改革、镇压反革命、抗美援朝的斗争，从而使我们最大限度地孤立了敌人，并且增强了革命的力量。在社会主义改造过程中，工人阶级同民族资产阶级的联盟，对于教育和改造资产阶级分子起了积极的作用；在今后，我们还可以通过这种联盟对他们继续进行团结、教育和改造的工作，使他们利用自己的知识来为社会主义建设服务。由此可见，把这种联盟看作一种徒然的负担，是错误的。
    民族资产阶级的大多数人，近年来正在经历着社会主义改造的深刻变化。我们的任务是要继续和改进同他们的合作关系，使他们有充分的机会发挥能力和专长，并且进行进一步的自我改造。同过去一样，这种合作仍然是有团结又有斗争的。在社会主义改造完成以前，阶级斗争仍然继续存在。在社会主义改造完成以后，社会主义和资本主义的立场、观点和方法之间的斗争，还会继续一个很长的时间。我们进行这种斗争的主要方法是说服教育的方法，只是对于那些对社会主义采取敌对态度并且违抗国家法律的个别的人，才必须分别情况采取必要的强制改造方法。
    我国的民主党派主要是在抗日战争时期形成的，并且同我们党早就发生了合作的关系。它们在中华人民共和国成立的时候，参加了人民政府，随后又逐步地支持了社会主义的事业。在今后，我们认为，应当采取共产党和各民主党派长期共存、互相监督的方针。中国各民主党派的社会基础是民族资产阶级、上层小资产阶级和它们的知识分子。在社会主义改造完成以后，民族资产阶级和上层小资产阶级的成员将变成社会主义的劳动者的一部分。各民主党派就将变成这部分劳动者的政党。由于在这部分劳动者中，资产阶级思想的残余还会拖得很长，各民主党派还需要在一个很长的时间内继续联系他们，代表他们，并且帮助他们改造。同时，各民主党派同共产党一道长期存在，在各党派之间也能够起互相监督的作用。我们的党是一个不为私利而全心全意为人民服务的政党。但是我们现在还有缺点，将来也一定还有缺点，并且不可能没有错误。我们当然首先要加强党内的自我批评和依靠广大劳动人民的监督来消除这些缺点和错误；同时，我们也应当善于从各民主党派和无党派民主人士的监督和批评中得到帮助。
    各民主党派的代表人物和无党派民主人士在我们的许多国家机关中担任着重要的职务。在我们的政府机关、学校、企业和武装部队中，还有广大的党外工作人员。这就要求我们的党员必须同党外工作人员建立良好的合作共事关系。这个问题之所以必须提出，是因为至今还有一部分共产党员抱着一种“清一色”的观点，他们不愿意党外人士参加国家机关的工作，或者有事不同党外人士商量，不尊重党外人士的职权。这种观点是一种宗派主义观点。共产党员在任何时候在人民中都是少数，因此共产党员在任何时候都有义务同党外的人合作。党必须教育那些不善于同党外的人合作的党员迅速地克服自己的缺点，这是目前巩固人民民主统一战线的重要任务之一。
    随着我国社会主义事业的胜利发展，我们的人民民主统一战线的范围将愈来愈广泛。对于少数民族的上层人士、宗教界的爱国人士和其他有各种社会影响的爱国人士，我们都应当继续坚持同他们的团结。海外各地的爱国华侨也是统一战线的组成部分，我们必须继续团结他们。总之，我们的任务就是使一切积极因素都能够动员起来，使他们对于建设社会主义的事业都能贡献一份力量。
    由此可见，最广泛的统一战线和最广泛的爱国主义团结，不但没有损害我们的无产阶级专政，而且有利于无产阶级专政的巩固和发展。
    我们的国家制度是高度的民主和高度的集中的结合。这个制度已经在我国过去几年的历史中表现了它的优越性。这当然不是说，我们的国家工作就是完全健全的了。我们的许多国家机关和工作人员在工作中常常脱离我们的国家制度的正确原则，不是发挥了而是妨碍了我们的国家制度的生动力量。当然也不是说，我们的国家制度已经一切都已完备了。它还需要相当的时间使自己逐步地成熟和完善起来。
    什么是我们目前改进国家工作的主要任务呢？
    为了适应社会主义改造和社会主义建设的新形势，目前在国家工作中的一个重要任务，是进一步扩大民主生活，开展反对官僚主义的斗争。
    在我们的许多国家机关中，存在着高高在上、不了解下级和群众的意见、对于下级和群众的意见加以压制、对于群众生活漠不关心的官僚主义现象。这种脱离群众、脱离实际的官僚主义，严重地妨碍着国家的民主生活的发展，妨碍着广大群众的积极性的发挥，妨碍着社会主义事业的前进。我们必须认真地、有系统地改善国家机关，精简它们的组织机构，明确规定每个工作人员的责任，帮助他们改变那种只是忙于开会、签公文而不接近群众、不研究情况和政策的作风，定出中央一级和省、市一级的国家机关各部门负责人经常深入下层、了解下情、检查工作、倾听意见的具体办法，督促他们严格地加以执行。
    反对官僚主义是一个长期的斗争。但是，我们完全有信心可以在我们的人民民主制度下逐步消除官僚主义的病害。因为我们的国家同那些少数人压迫绝大多数人的剥削阶级的国家相反，我们的制度是反对官僚主义而不是保护官僚主义的。为了同官僚主义作有效的斗争，我们必须同时从几个方面加强对于国家工作的监督。第一，必须加强党对于国家机关的领导和监督。除了党的各级委员会必须经常检查各级政府中党组织的工作以外，党委的各个工作部门应当负责建立起对于有关的政府工作部门中党组织和党员的经常的监督。第二，必须加强全国人民代表大会和它的常务委员会对中央一级政府机关的监督和地方各级人民代表大会对地方各级政府机关的监督。为了这个目的，应当加强人民代表的视察工作，以便广泛地收集人民群众的意见，并且加强各级人民代表大会对于政府工作的检查、批评和讨论。第三，必须加强各级政府机关的由上而下的监督和由下而上的监督。在反对官僚主义的斗争中，国家的监察机关应当充分地发挥它的应有作用。第四，必须加强人民群众和机关中的下级工作人员对于国家机关的监督。必须鼓励和支持由下而上的批评和揭露；凡是对批评者实行压制和报复的人，必须受到应得的处分。
    目前国家工作中另一个重要问题，是必须适当地调整中央和地方的行政管理职权。这也是符合于扩大民主生活、克服官僚主义的要求的。
    在中华人民共和国成立以后，为了实现和巩固国家的统一，我们反对了分散主义，把许多应当由中央管理的事务集中到中央手里，这是完全必要的。但是，近几年来中央有些部门把过多的事务抓到自己手里，对地方限制得过多过死，忽视地方的特殊情况和特殊条件，应当同地方商量的事也不同地方商量；有些部门还发出许多形式主义的公文和表格，给地方压力很大。这样，既不利于地方的工作，也分散了中央的精力，发展了官僚主义。不可能设想：在我们这样大的国家中，中央能够把国家的各种事务都包揽起来，而且样样办好。把一部分行政管理职权分给地方，是完全必要的。国家的很多工作，例如农业、小型和中型的工业、地方的运输事业、地方的商业、中小学教育、地方的卫生事业和地方的财政等等，中央只应当提出一般的方针政策和大体的规划，具体工作应当交由地方因地制宜、因时制宜地去部署办理，并且应当把中央机关的干部分一部分到地方去工作。省、市、县、乡都应当有一定范围的行政管理职权。根据这样的方针，现在中央正在同地方共同研究和拟定具体方案，准备逐步地加以实行。这样，既能够发挥中央机关的积极性，也能够发挥地方的积极性，使中央和地方都有必要的机动性，同时又能够实行互相监督。这对于促进我国社会主义建设的普遍高涨具有重要的意义。
    正确地处理少数民族问题，是我们的国家工作中一项重大的任务。我们必须用更大的努力来帮助各少数民族在经济和文化上的进步，使各少数民族在我国社会主义建设事业中充分地发挥积极作用。
    少数民族的状况在过去几年中已经发生了很大的变化。少数民族中的民主改革和社会主义改造已经在大多数地区取得了决定性的胜利。在国内三千五百多万少数民族人口中，已经有二千八百万人口的地区基本上完成了社会主义改造，另有二百二十万人口的地区正在进行社会主义改造，有近二百万人口的地区正在进行民主改革，只有三百多万人口的地区还没有进行民主改革。在这些地区进行民主改革和社会主义改造的时候，我们仍然必须采取我们所一贯采取的慎重方针，这就是说，必须由各少数民族的人民和公众领袖从容考虑，协商处理，按照各民族自己的意愿办事。在改革中应当坚持和平的方式，而不要采取强力斗争的方式。对于少数民族的上层人士，在他们放弃对于劳动人民的剥削和压迫以后，国家要采取适当的办法，使他们的政治待遇和生活水平不致降低，并且说服人民群众同他们长期合作。对于少数民族地区的宗教信仰问题，我们必须长期坚持地执行宗教信仰自由的政策，决不可以在社会改革中加以干涉；对于宗教职业者的生活困难，应当帮助他们得到适当的解决。
    各少数民族要发展成为现代民族，除开要进行社会改革以外，最根本的关键是要在他们的地区发展现代工业。国家在第一个五年计划期间，已经在一些少数民族地区，建立了一些新的工业基地，举办了一些大型的现代工业和运输业，在第二个五年计划期间还将继续这样做。这是全国各民族人民的共同利益和根本利益。汉族人民和少数民族人民都应当为完满地实现国家的这个计划而共同奋斗。同时，为了满足少数民族人民的特殊需要，中央各部门和各省、自治区政府，还应当根据客观上可能和经济上合理的原则，在少数民族地区逐步地举办一些地方工业。凡是在少数民族地区的工业，无论是中央国营工业或者是地方工业，都必须注意帮助少数民族形成自己的工人阶级，培养自己的科学技术干部和企业管理干部。只有这样，少数民族在各方面的发展才能比较快地达到现代的水平。
    由于历史形成的现实条件，少数民族中的社会改革和经济文化建设，都需要汉族人民的大力援助，所以，继续改进汉族人民和少数民族人民、汉族干部和少数民族干部之间的关系，就有特别重要的意义。在目前，为了改进这种关系，主要的问题是要克服大汉族主义。
    几年来，我们有很多的汉族干部在各少数民族地区工作，他们的大多数正确地执行了党的民族政策，完成了党给他们的任务，受到了少数民族的欢迎。但是也有一部分汉族干部，不尊重少数民族干部的职权和意见，不积极地耐心地帮助少数民族当家作主，而是由自己在那里包办代替。这些缺点和错误，同某些同志的思想中存在着轻视少数民族的大汉族主义倾向是有关的。
    中国各民族共同地创造了我国的历史和文化，今后各民族也一定要共同地建设我们伟大的社会主义祖国。国内各少数民族的发展水平是不一样的，但是绝对不是所有的少数民族在所有的方面都是落后的。有一些民族的发展水平同汉族一样或者差不多，还有一些民族在某些方面的发展比汉族高，值得汉族人民向他们学习。每一个民族都有自己的长处。认为少数民族一无长处、样样不如汉族的观点，就是一种大汉族主义的观点。
    忽视各少数民族在我国社会主义建设中的重要作用，也是大汉族主义的一种表现。各少数民族的人口虽然只占全国总人口的百分之六，但是他们居住的地区，却占全国总面积的百分之六十左右，其中许多地方富有各种工业资源。如果认为不要少数民族的共同努力和积极参加，单凭汉族人民的努力，就可以把我国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义国家，这显然是一种错误的想法。
    所有上述大汉族主义的倾向和观点，都必须切实改正。只有坚决地克服了大汉族主义的任何一种细小的表现，少数民族中的地方民族主义情绪才能顺利地克服，而国内各兄弟民族才能在我们的人民民主的大家庭里面更加亲密地团结起来。
    为了巩固我们的人民民主专政，为了保卫社会主义建设的秩序和保障人民的民主权利，为了惩治反革命分子和其他犯罪分子，我们目前在国家工作中的迫切任务之一，是着手系统地制定比较完备的法律，健全我们国家的法制。
    我们在革命战争时期和全国解放初期，为了肃清残余的敌人，镇压一切反革命分子的反抗，破坏反动的秩序，建立革命的秩序，只能根据党和人民政府的政策，规定一些临时的纲领性的法律。在这个时期，斗争的主要任务是从反动统治下解放人民，从旧的生产关系的束缚下解放社会生产力，斗争的主要方法是人民群众的直接行动。因此，那些纲领性的法律是适合于当时的需要的。现在，革命的暴风雨时期已经过去了，新的生产关系已经建立起来，斗争的任务已经变为保护社会生产力的顺利发展，因此，斗争的方法也就必须跟着改变，完备的法制就是完全必要的了。为了正常的社会生活和社会生产的利益，必须使全国每一个人都明了并且确信，只要他没有违反法律，他的公民权利就是有保障的，他就不会受到任何机关和任何人的侵犯；如果有人非法地侵犯他，国家就必然出来加以干涉。我们的一切国家机关都必须严格地遵守法律，而我们的公安机关、检察机关和法院，必须贯彻执行法制方面的分工负责和互相制约的制度。
    反革命分子是要破坏我们的国家、破坏我们的建设、危害人民的安全的，因此我们的国家机关必须镇压和肃清反革命分子。我们在一九五○年领导了全国范围的镇压反革命的斗争，给了反革命分子的活动以严重的打击。在一九五五年，我们又在社会上进行了镇压反革命的斗争，在全国的机关中对于暗藏的反革命分子进行了清查。这些大规模的群众斗争，大大地巩固了社会的秩序，加强了国家的安全。
    我们对反革命分子和其他犯罪分子一贯地实行惩办和宽大相结合的政策，凡是坦白的、悔过的、立功的，一律给以宽大的处置。大家知道，这个政策已经收到了巨大的成效。从去年下半年以来，由于惩办和宽大相结合的政策的影响，由于社会主义改造高潮的影响，由于人民群众的觉悟程度和组织程度的提高，反革命分子的活动愈来愈感到困难，因而在反革命分子中发生了激烈的分化，成批的反革命分子向政府投案自首。这个事实说明，一方面，反革命分子确是存在着，认为可以放松警惕性的想法是完全错误的；另一方面，只要我们的政策正确，反革命分子是可以肃清的，认为反革命活动会愈来愈严重的想法也是没有根据的。
    在今后，我们的公安机关、检察机关和法院仍然必须同反革命分子和其他犯罪分子进行坚决的斗争。但是如上所说，这一斗争必须严格地遵守法制，并且应当根据目前的新情况，进一步实行宽大政策。党中央委员会认为，除了极少数的罪犯由于罪大恶极，造成人民的公愤，因而不能不处死刑的以外，对于其余一切罪犯都应当不处死刑，并且应当在他们服徒刑的期间给以完全人道主义的待遇。凡属需要处死刑的案件，应当一律归最高人民法院判决或者核准。这样，我们就可以逐步地达到完全废除死刑的目的，而这是有利于我们的社会主义建设的。
    为了保卫我们的祖国，我们还必须继续加强我们的国防，继续加强我们的国防军——光荣的中国人民解放军。我们的军队必须努力提高自己的战斗力，警惕地守卫我们的边境和海岸线，保卫我国领土的完整。
    我们祖国的领土台湾还被美帝国主义所霸占，这是对于我国安全的一个最大的威胁。解放台湾的问题完全是我国的内政问题。我们愿意用和平谈判的方式，使台湾重新回到祖国的怀抱，而避免使用武力。如果不得已而使用武力，那是在和平谈判丧失了可能性，或者是在和平谈判失败以后。不管采用什么方法，解放台湾的正义事业一定能够取得最后的胜利。
    （五）国际关系
    为了把我国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义国家，我们不但要团结国内一切可能团结的力量，而且要争取国际上的一切有利条件，团结国际上一切可能团结的力量。
    我国现在所处的国际环境是怎样的呢？
    总的说来，目前的国际形势对于我们的社会主义建设是有利的。这是由于社会主义的、民族独立的、民主的、和平的势力，在第二次世界大战以后，有了空前的发展，而帝国主义侵略集团的积极进行扩张、反对和平共处、准备新的世界战争的政策，愈来愈不得人心。在这种情况下，世界局势不能不趋向于和缓，世界的持久和平已经开始有了实现的可能。
    在十月革命以后，苏联人民进行社会主义建设的时候，世界上还没有第二个社会主义国家。但是，在我国人民进行社会主义建设的时候，情况就已经根本不同了。第二次世界大战以后，不但苏联变得更加强大，而且在欧亚两洲出现了许多新的社会主义国家。现在，包括中国在内，社会主义国家已经拥有占人类总数三分之一的九亿多人口，并且在地理上连成一片，组成了以苏联为首的社会主义国家的友好的大家庭。我们之间的这种兄弟般的友谊和互助合作的关系，正在不断地发展和巩固。苏联和其他社会主义国家同南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国，已经恢复了友好的关系。我国同南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国也已经建立了外交关系，发展了友好的来往。
    现在，社会主义各国正动员国内人民的一切力量，从事社会主义的和平建设，工农业生产以资本主义国家所难以比拟的速度向前发展着。我们在对外关系中一贯执行着坚定的和平政策，主张一切国家间的和平共处和友好合作。我们相信社会主义制度的优越性，不怕同资本主义国家进行和平竞赛。我们的政策符合于全世界人民的利益。一切爱好和平、要求民族独立和争取社会进步的力量都会得到我们的同情和支持。社会主义国家在全世界人民中的声望日益增长，对于国际形势发展的影响日益扩大。以苏联为首的社会主义国家已经成为争取世界持久和平的坚强堡垒。
    今年二月举行的苏联共产党的第二十次代表大会是具有世界意义的重大政治事件。它不仅制定了规模宏伟的第六个五年计划，决定了进一步发展社会主义事业的许多重大的政策方针，批判了在党内曾经造成严重后果的个人崇拜现象，而且提出了进一步促进和平共处和国际合作的主张，对于世界紧张局势的和缓作出了显著的贡献。
    社会主义国家的强大和团结一致，是我国进行社会主义建设的最有利的国际条件。
    第二次世界大战后另一个有伟大历史意义的发展，是民族独立运动的广泛胜利。除了越南民主共和国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、中华人民共和国已经走上了社会主义的道路以外，在亚洲和非洲，摆脱了殖民主义束缚的，还有其他一系列的民族独立国家。这些民族独立国家，包括我们的伟大邻邦印度在内，共有六亿几千万人口，占人类总数的四分之一。这些国家的绝大多数都在执行着和平中立的外交政策。它们在国际事务中起着愈来愈大的作用。在万隆召开的亚非会议的成功，许多亚非国家独立运动的新发展，特别是最近埃及把苏彝士运河公司收归国有的震动世界的事件，证明了民族独立运动已经形成为一种巨大的世界力量。在过去，亚非大多数国家都曾经是帝国主义的殖民地和半殖民地，是他们准备和进行战争的后方，但是现在却变成反对殖民主义、反对战争和支持和平共处的力量了。同时，在拉丁美洲的国家中，反殖民主义的斗争也在发展。帝国主义者正在竭力阻挡民族独立运动的潮流，但是这个潮流是阻挡不住的。它最后必将席卷整个亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲，从而永远结束殖民主义的统治。
    毫无疑问，社会主义国家的存在，社会主义国家对于民族独立运动的同情和支持，大大地便利了这一运动的发展和胜利。同时，民族独立运动的高涨又削弱了帝国主义的侵略势力，有利于世界和平的事业，因而也有利于社会主义国家的和平建设。因此，社会主义国家和民族独立国家的友好合作，既符合于彼此的共同利益，也符合于世界和平的利益。
    这一些伟大的历史变化，是同帝国主义的、特别是美帝国主义的愿望背道而驰的。美国垄断资本利用它在第二次世界大战中发了横财的有利地位，在战后进行疯狂的扩张活动，首先是控制德日等战败国，夺取英法等国在亚洲和非洲的势力范围，力图树立世界霸权。它组织军事集团，建立军事基地，制造紧张局势，准备新的战争。美帝国主义把它的这一切活动说成是为了“防御共产主义侵略”。但是，谎话究竟不能掩盖事实。社会主义同侵略是根本不能相容的。在社会主义国家里，既然消灭了依靠侵略发财、依靠殖民地和国外市场发财的阶级，也就消灭了对外侵略的社会根源。而在帝国主义国家里，依靠侵略发财的集团是永远不会自愿地停止侵略的。世界人民看得很清楚：苏联、中国和其他社会主义国家积极主张和平共处，发展东西方的经济文化关系，并且带头裁减了自己的武装部队，削减了自己的军费。相反，美帝国主义却仍然在扩张军备，反对发展东西方的关系，害怕和平共处好像害怕世界末日一样；它的武装力量至今还在远离自己的国界几千公里以外霸占着我国的台湾，在日本、南朝鲜、菲律宾和西欧各国的领土上横行霸道。
    把“防共”和“反共”的口号当作烟幕来掩盖一个国家统治世界的企图，在第二次世界大战以前就早已流行过了。帝国主义者当然十分仇恨社会主义国家。但是，他们也知道，强大和团结一致的社会主义国家是碰不倒的。因此，美帝国主义目前的主要活动，实际上是假借“反共”之名，以便压制本国的人民，尽可能地控制和干涉处于社会主义国家和美国之间的广大中间地带。
    美帝国主义的这些活动日益引起各方面的反抗，日益加深资本主义体系内部一切固有的矛盾。现在，受过和正在受着殖民主义灾害的国家和人民已经愈来愈认识到，美帝国主义是当前最大、最贪婪的殖民主义者。在亚非地区，愈来愈多的民族独立国家采取了和平中立政策，拒绝参加美国的侵略性军事集团，有力地限制了美帝国主义的殖民扩张。在西方国家中，也有愈来愈多的国家逐渐识破了美国扩张政策对它们危害的真象，而拒绝把自己套在美国的战车上、赞成同社会主义国家和平共处的中立趋势，也已经日益发展。美国的主要盟国英法两国，曾经企图凭借美国的力量来维持自己的既得利益。但是，事实上，追随美国的扩军备战政策只是为美国势力的入侵开辟了道路，而沉重的军费负担日益严重地妨碍着它们国家经济的发展。这就加强了美国的主要盟国对于美国的垄断和控制的不满和反抗，特别是加深了英美之间的矛盾。同时，西方各国的人民群众正在日益展开广泛的和平民主运动，反对美国的扩军备战政策。美国人民也已经逐渐地体会到这种政策为他们带来沉重的负担和战争的危险。就是在美国统治集团内部，也有一些头脑比较清醒的人逐渐认识到战争政策未必对美国有利。
    英法统治集团的外交政策正处在矛盾和混乱之中。英法两国在目前整个国际局势的影响下，虽然表示了一定程度的和平共处的愿望，但是它们由于企图保持殖民主义的特权，对于民族独立运动却不愿意放弃武力威胁的政策。这种状况，在埃及政府收回苏彝士运河公司以后的发展中，特别明显地表现出来了。英法政府想用武力干涉的方法，破坏埃及的神圣主权，重新夺取苏彝士运河。美国一方面支持英法的侵略行为，另一方面企图乘机夺取它们在中东的利益。帝国主义的侵略政策和民族独立国家的反侵略运动之间的斗争，在中东正在尖锐化。全世界的最广泛的同情是在埃及方面，全世界最广泛的舆论都主张和平解决苏彝士运河的争端。英法如果不遵循和平解决的途径，而实行武力干涉，那就不但会受到埃及人民和阿拉伯各国人民的英勇抗击，而且必将引起整个社会主义阵营、亚非两洲、拉丁美洲以及西方国家的广大人民的坚决反对，也将引起英法两国广大人民的坚决反对。世界是要走向和平的；在苏彝士运河问题上和其他民族独立运动的问题上，采取武力干涉政策只能招致彻底的失败。
    毫无疑问，帝国主义者还会继续制造紧张局势，还要压迫一切他们可能压迫的人民，战争的危险仍然存在。在这个问题上，如果我们丧失警惕性，那就会犯错误。人类争取和平和进步的斗争必然还要经历许多迂回曲折的过程。但是，世界的总的趋势是光明的。只要社会主义各国和世界上一切和平民主力量团结一致，共同努力，世界的持久和平和人类进步的事业就终将取得胜利。
    我们在国际事务中坚定不移的方针，是为世界和平和人类进步的事业而努力。在过去几年中，我们在这方面的工作是有成绩的。
    中国人民在革命斗争中，得到了以苏联为首的和平民主社会主义阵营的支持。中华人民共和国在成立以后不久，就同伟大的苏联签订了友好同盟互助条约。几年来的事实证明，伟大的中苏同盟是远东和世界和平的重要支柱。对于我国的社会主义建设，苏联给了巨大的援助；欧洲和亚洲的人民民主国家也给了种种的援助。兄弟国家的这种同志式的援助，是中国人民永远不能忘记的。这种援助，无论在过去、现在和将来，都是我们所不可缺少的。中国同伟大的苏联和其他社会主义国家，在共同目标和相互援助的基础上建立起来的团结和友谊，是牢不可破的，是永恒的。继续巩固和加强这种团结和友谊，是我们最高的国际义务，是我国对外政策的基础。
    中国身受过殖民主义的灾害，而且中国的领土台湾到现在还处于美国的控制之下。中国人民深切地同情并且积极支持一切被压迫民族和被侵略的国家反对殖民主义和维护民族独立的斗争。这个斗争的每一个胜利，不论它出现在亚洲、非洲或者是拉丁美洲，都将会进一步加强和平的力量。
    中国同刚刚从殖民主义统治下解放出来的其他亚非国家有许多共同的经历、处境和愿望。我们在一般的国际关系中，首先在相互关系中，都有相互尊重领土完整和主权、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利和和平共处的要求。中国同印度首先倡议的五项原则，体现了这些共同要求。我们已经根据这些原则同许多亚非国家建立了友好合作关系，促进了这个地区的和平。
    我们争取在五项原则的基础上首先同我们的所有邻国建立睦邻关系。我们同这些国家有深厚的传统友谊，而没有不可解决的争端。在我们同某些邻国之间，存在着一些历史上遗留下来的问题。帝国主义者力图利用这种情况来破坏和阻挠我们同邻国发展和建立友好关系。但是，这种企图是注定要失败的。我们同邻国之间的一切问题，都可以根据五项原则，通过和平协商的途径，求得解决。我们同邻国发展和建立友好关系，既符合我国的利益，也符合我们邻国的利益。
    我国同欧洲的一些西方国家，已经建立了正常关系。
    我国准备同一切尚未同我国建交的国家建立正常的外交关系。建立这种关系是对于双方都有利的。
    我们以五项原则为基础的和平共处政策不排斥任何国家。对于美国，我们也同样具有同它和平共处的愿望。但是，美国一贯地敌视我国，侵占我国的台湾，派遣特务对我国进行颠复活动，对我国实行禁运，并且竭力在国际事务中排斥我国，蛮横地剥夺我国在联合国的合法地位。虽然如此，我国政府仍然努力通过和平协商的方法解决同美国的争端。我们曾经一再建议举行中美外长会议，来解决和缓与消除台湾地区紧张局势的问题。我国的这种努力，只是为了和缓国际紧张局势，而不是在任何意义上承认侵略。全世界都知道，我国人民对于保卫祖国的独立和安全是不怕付出代价的。但是美国政府对于我国的态度至今还远不是现实的和合理的。结果怎样呢？尽管美帝国主义采取一切罪恶的手段来破坏我国，企图孤立我国，但是，伟大的新中国在世界上屹立着。正义是在我们方面，世界的广大的同情是在我们方面。在世界上被孤立的，并不是我国，而恰恰是美帝国主义。如果美帝国主义不愿继续失败下去，它的出路，只能是对于我国采取现实的合理的态度。这种情况，对于美国人也已经不是什么秘密了。
    中国人民和世界各国人民都需要和平，都需要增进相互间的经济文化关系和友好来往。我国人民在过去几年中积极地参加了有益于世界和平的各种国际活动，并且积极地发展了同各国人民的经济文化的交流，发展了同各国人民团体和各方面社会人士的交往。虽然我们在这些方面遇到了许多人为的障碍，我们的国际友人还是愈来愈多。事实证明，铁幕不在我们这一边。我们的门是对一切人敞开的。
    以上这些，就是我们处理国际事务的基本政策。我们今后仍将继续贯彻执行这些政策。
    （六）党的领导
    在党的第七次代表大会到第八次代表大会期间，随着革命的胜利和国家状况的变化，党本身的状况也有了很大的变化。党已经成为领导全国政权的党，在人民群众中具有很高的威信。党的组织壮大了。现在党已经有一千○七十三万党员，其中工人党员占百分之十四，农民党员占百分之六十九，知识分子党员占百分之十二。党的组织已经分布到全国，并且分布到各个民族。绝大多数的党员都受了伟大的革命斗争的锻炼。就是占百分之六十以上的一九四九年以后入党的新党员，基本上也都是过去几年的群众革命斗争和社会主义劳动中涌现出来的先进积极分子。整个说来，党同人民群众的联系是更加密切了，党的工作经验是更加丰富和全面了，党的团结比过去任何时候都更加巩固了。
    我们已经说过，在我们国家的社会主义事业中不可能没有无产阶级专政，而无产阶级专政是经过无产阶级的政党——共产党的领导来实现的。中国共产党的领导的力量，在于它有马克思列宁主义的思想武器，有正确的政治路线和组织路线，有丰富的斗争经验和工作经验，善于把全国人民的智慧集中起来，并且把这种智慧表现为统一的意志和有纪律的行动。不但在过去，而且在今后，为了保证我们的国家能够有效地处理国内和国际的复杂事务，都必须有这样的一个党的领导。这是全国各阶层人民和各民主党派根据实际生活所共同承认的。
    但是，在社会主义建设的工作中，也有极少数同志曾经企图削弱党的领导作用。他们把党对于国家各方面工作的政策方针的领导问题同单纯技术方面的问题混淆起来，他们认为党对于这些工作的技术业务还是外行，因而就不应当领导这些工作，而他们则可以独断专行。我们批判了这种错误的观点。党应当而且可以在思想上、政治上、方针政策上对于一切工作起领导作用。当然，这不是说，党应当把一切都包办起来，对一切都进行干涉；也不是说，对于自己所不懂的事情，可以安于做外行。党要求我们的干部和党员进行艰苦的学习来学会自己工作中所不懂的事情。我们学习得愈多，就会领导得愈好。
    像我们在前面所说，党从第七次代表大会以来的路线是正确的，这是事实所已经证明了的。但是应当承认，我们党在担负目前的日益繁重的任务方面，并不是没有困难了，并不是不会犯错误了。我们在社会主义改造方面，社会主义建设方面，国家政治生活方面，都犯过暂时的、局部的错误。在国际事务的处理上，也不是毫无缺点和错误的。因此，党的领导的任务之一就是要研究和分析过去所犯的错误，取得教训，从而求得在今后的工作中少犯错误，尽量不重复已经犯过的错误，并且尽量不使小错误变为大错误。
    要使我们党今后继续保持正确的、健全的领导，根本的问题是在于努力减少党组织和党员在思想认识上的错误。在我们党内有正确思想和错误思想、正确路线和错误路线的斗争，这种斗争是阶级斗争和各种社会现象的反映。我国原来是小资产阶级占多数的国家，这个阶级的情绪经常影响我们，不断地给我们压力，资产阶级也经常从各方面来影响我们。党必须经常进行党内教育，不让资产阶级和小资产阶级的思想损害我们党在政治上的纯洁。但是我们的错误不但有社会的根源，而且有认识上的根源。一个人如果不懂得正确的意见只能是对于实际事物的客观的全面的反映，而坚持要按自己的主观的片面的想法去办事，那末，即使他有一切善良的动机，也还是会犯或大或小的错误。因此，为了避免犯错误，必须正确地认识客观实际，正确地辨明是非。
    鉴于目前我们的党员十分之九都是第七次代表大会以后入党的，在这里简单地回顾一下在党的历史上正确的路线怎样有效地克服错误路线的基本经验，我们认为并不是没有现实意义的。
    我们党在三十五年的历史中，曾经犯过四次严重的路线错误，这就是一九二七年上半年的陈独秀右倾机会主义路线和以后七年间先后发生的三次“左”倾机会主义路线的错误。而从一九三五年一月党中央的遵义会议以来的二十一年中，我们党在以毛泽东同志为首的中央的领导下，却没有犯过路线错误。这个历史的变化究竟应当怎样解释呢？很明显，这不能仅仅用党的历史长短、经验多少去解释，因为党在一九三一年至一九三四年间所犯的错误反而比以前两次的“左”倾错误更为严重；也不能仅仅用某个时期党的领导者个人情况如何去解释，因为大多数犯过错误的领导者在后来也为党作了很好的工作。从我们党的历史可以得出这样的结论：党的经验多少和党的领导人选对于党是否犯错误有重要的关系，但是关系更重要的，是各个时期广大党员首先是党的高级干部是否善于用马克思列宁主义的立场、观点和方法去总结斗争中的经验，坚持真理，修正错误。这是考验党的干部的马克思列宁主义觉悟水平高低的主要标志。党的干部的马克思列宁主义的觉悟水平愈高，他们识别正确的意见和错误的意见、识别好的领导者和坏的领导者的能力也就愈高，他们的工作能力也就愈高。
    党在一九三四年以前，虽然积累了丰富的经验，但是当时党的领导机关并没有给以认真的研究；虽然否定过几次错误路线，但是实际上只是处分了犯错误的领导者，并没有正确地分析那些错误和那些错误在思想认识上的根源，因而就不可能帮助党的干部提高觉悟水平。特别是在一九三一年到一九三四年期间统治全党的以王明、博古等同志为首的“左”倾机会主义者，不但没有接受过去几次错误路线的教训，而且由于他们的教条主义的思想方法和横蛮武断的作风，把主观主义和宗派主义的错误发展到了党的历史上空前未有的地步。他们完全不顾当时国内社会各阶级的实际状况，不顾敌我力量对比的客观形势，在政治上和军事上都采取了极端冒险的政策，在党内生活上也完全破坏了党内的民主制度，发展了过火的党内斗争。他们的错误领导，使革命斗争遭到严重的失败，使当时的革命根据地和工农红军损失了百分之九十，国民党统治区的党组织和党领导下的革命组织几乎损失了百分之百。
    但是在一九三五年以后就不同了。党在一九三五年的转变，基本上就是党的高级干部的多数从失败中得到了经验、提高了觉悟的结果。在这以后，党中央并没有给犯错误的同志以严重的惩办，仍然分配他们以适当的领导职务，耐心地等待和帮助他们从思想上真正地认识自己的错误。同时党中央又系统地帮助全党干部逐步地了解马克思列宁主义的理论和实际相结合的原理，了解我们的主观认识必须符合于客观实际的原理。由于党的思想工作和组织工作有了重大的改进，党的事业就得到了迅速的发展。为了帮助全党干部，包括犯过错误的同志在内，认真地研究党的历史经验，学会正确的思想方法和工作方法，以求减少在工作中的错误，党中央曾经在遵义会议的七年以后，在全党发动了反对主观主义、宗派主义和党八股的著名的“整风运动”，组织全党干部在这个运动中，按照马克思列宁主义的立场、观点、方法详细地检查自己的思想和工作，检查党在思想上、政治上和组织上的领导，展开深刻的批评和自我批评。这样，就真正地提高了大批干部的马克思列宁主义的觉悟水平和对于党内是非的辨别能力。大批干部认识了同实际脱节的教条主义的错误，也认识了同理论脱节的经验主义的错误，养成了联系群众、调查研究和实事求是的作风。他们在党内外所进行的工作，就变得比较符合客观实际了，工作中的重大错误就减少了。
    以上所说的我们党的历史经验，充分地说明了克服思想认识上的主观主义，是保证党的工作顺利发展、避免重大错误的根本关键。
    主观主义的错误在目前我们许多干部的思想上和工作中仍然严重地存在着，使我们的工作受到许多不应有的损失。我们现在面对着新的条件和新的任务，我们必须解决许多比过去更为复杂的和不熟悉的问题。在这种情况下，如果我们不努力提高马克思列宁主义的觉悟水平，不努力学习新的知识，钻研新的业务，而满足于对胜利的一片赞扬，主观主义的错误就必然会发展起来。同时，涌入我们党的大批新党员，还没有受到足够的马克思列宁主义的锻炼，也很容易成为主观主义、教条主义的市场。
    为了有效地反对主观主义，必须进行有系统的努力来提高我们党的马克思列宁主义的水平。首先，我们必须认真地加强干部的首先是高级干部的系统的马克思列宁主义的学习，使他们善于用马克思列宁主义的立场、观点、方法去观察和解决实际生活中的问题，提高自己在复杂情况中判断方向、辨明是非的能力，并且学会用马克思列宁主义的理论去研究和整理自己的工作经验，在经验中找出具体事物发展的规律性。第二，必须加强在广大的新党员中理论和实际统一的教育，使他们逐步懂得马克思列宁主义的立场、观点和方法，获得关于马克思列宁主义的一般原理、党的历史和我国社会主义事业现状的基本知识，认识主观主义——包括教条主义和经验主义——的危害，而在知识分子新党员中，则要特别着重认识教条主义的危害。第三，必须加强党的理论工作。我们应当迅速地集中必要的党内外马克思列宁主义的科学工作力量，从事我国社会主义改造和社会主义建设的重大问题和基本经验的研究，从事当前国际问题的研究，从事马克思列宁主义基本理论以及同马克思列宁主义有密切关系的科学部门的研究，使这一系列研究适合于当前党的实际工作的迫切需要，适合于向广大党员和广大青年进行理论和实际统一的马克思列宁主义教育的迫切需要。
    为了有效地反对主观主义，党的各级领导机关都应当大大加强对于实际情况的调查研究工作。在过去几年的党的工作中所曾犯过的右倾保守、急躁冒进和强迫命令的错误，都是由于没有认真地、正确地研究实际情况和集中群众经验的结果。不少党的工作人员，也同前面说过的某些国家机关的工作人员一样，开始表现出骄傲自满的情绪，宁愿坐在机关里，用空谈代替调查，由感想定出政策，而不愿意深入下层，倾听下情，检查党的决议的执行情况并且从实践中检验党的决议是否正确，刻苦地研究新鲜事物并且正确地支持新鲜事物的发展。党必须教育他们深刻地认识他们的这种主观主义在工作中造成的损害，必须帮助他们学会用老老实实的态度在群众中进行调查研究，帮助他们学会“从群众中来，到群众中去”的工作方法，并且使他们懂得，这是他们能够继续担负党的领导工作的必要条件。
    为了力求党的领导工作符合于客观实际，便利于集中群众的经验和意见，减少犯错误的机会，必须在党的各级组织中无例外地贯彻执行党的集体领导原则和扩大党内民主。一切重大问题的决定都要在适当的集体中经过充分的讨论，容许不同观点的无拘束的争论，以便比较全面地反映党内外群众的各种意见，也就是比较全面地反映客观事物发展过程中的各个侧面。每个领导者都必须善于耐心地听取和从容地考虑反对的意见，坚决地接受合理的反对意见或者反对意见中的合理部分；对于由正确动机、按正常程序提出任何反对意见的任何同志，必须继续和睦无间地共事，绝不要采取排斥的态度。只有这样，才会有真正的而不是形式的集体领导，才会有真正的而不是形式的党内团结，党的组织和事业也才会更加兴旺。
    关于贯彻党的集体领导原则和扩大党内民主的问题，在党中央委员会所提出的新的中国共产党章程草案中受到了充分的注意。对于这个草案，邓小平同志将作详细的说明，因此我不需要在这里多说了。党章草案关于党员的权利和党的下级组织的权利作了一些新的规定。草案规定，党员有在工作中充分发挥创造性的权利，并且在对于党的决议不同意的时候，除了无条件地执行以外，有保留和向党的领导机关提出自己的意见的权利。草案规定，凡属地方性质的问题和需要由地方决定的问题，应当由地方组织处理，以利于因地制宜；又规定党的下级组织如果认为上级组织的决议不符合本地区、本部门的实际情况，应当向上级组织请求改变这个决议。党章草案还规定，县一级以上各级的党代表大会改为常任制，每年召开一次。所有这些，必将促进我们党的各级组织和全体党员的积极性的高涨。
    当然，我们党的民主生活的扩大决不是减弱了而恰恰是加强了党的集中制，我们党的党员的创造性的发扬决不是减弱了而恰恰是加强了党的纪律性。同样，我们党的集体领导原则决不是否认了个人负责的必要和领导者的重要作用；相反，它是使领导者能够充分正确地和最有效地发挥个人作用的保证。大家知道，我们党的领袖毛泽东同志所以在我们的革命事业中起了伟大的舵手作用，所以在全党和全国人民中享有崇高的威信，不但是因为他善于把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理和中国革命的具体实践结合起来，而且是因为他坚决地信任群众的力量和智慧，倡导党的工作中的群众路线，坚持党的民主原则和集体领导原则。
    对于犯错误的同志采取正确的态度，是党的正确领导的必要条件之一。
    对于犯错误的同志给以严厉的处罚，以至把他们驱逐出党，这是很容易的。但是如果没有解决为什么造成错误的思想问题，那末，严厉的处罚不但不能保证党不再重犯同样的错误，甚至还会造成更大的错误。在“左”倾机会主义路线统治我们党的时期，在党内斗争中所实行的“残酷斗争，无情打击”的办法，只是造成了党内是非不明、死气沉沉的状况，使党内的有生力量受到了摧残，使党的事业受到了重大的损失。
    以毛泽东同志为首的党中央在纠正了王明、博古等同志的机会主义路线的错误以后，也彻底地改变了错误的党内斗争方式。
    在党内斗争中，党首先严格地区别了党内的是非问题同混入党内的反革命分子、蜕化分子和其他坏分子的问题的界限。
    对于混进党内的反革命分子，在党内坚持进行分裂破坏活动的阶级异己分子和其他不可救药的腐化堕落分子，党采取了坚决态度，把他们清除出去。在我们的队伍中确是混入了一些反革命分子和其他坏分子，我们已经清洗了一些，以后也还要继续注意防范和清洗。但是事实证明，这样的人只是极少数。在党领导了国家政权以后，党内贪污腐化、违法乱纪、道德堕落的现象有了某种程度的发展，这种严重现象必须坚决制止。过去我们进行了反对贪污浪费和违法乱纪的群众斗争，以后又粉碎了以阴谋手段夺取党和国家领导权的高饶反党联盟。在今后，我们还必须经常从思想上和组织上进行反对腐化堕落现象的斗争，经常把不可救药的腐化堕落分子清除出党。
    但是，对于任何由于认识上有错误而在工作上犯错误的同志，党都坚决地执行了“惩前毖后，治病救人”，“既要弄清思想，又要团结同志”的原则，着重思想的教育，而不轻易采取纪律处分。对于这些同志的错误思想，一定要实事求是地进行批评，并且具体地分析错误的根源。这样做的目的，是为了帮助他们，继续团结他们在一起工作。对于在工作上犯了严重错误的同志，虽然需要给以恰当的纪律处分，或者适当地调动工作，但是仍然必须用同志的态度耐心地帮助他们认识和改正错误，以达到团结的目的。总之，对于犯了错误的同志，只要所犯的错误可以在党内改正，并且本人愿意改正，就必须让他留在党内改正，并且不应当滥用组织权力，给以不适当的处分。反之，如果用简单的粗暴的方法去纠正思想性质的错误，那末，不但思想问题不会解决，错误还会重犯，而且必然伤害党内应有的和睦，甚至会把普通的意见分歧发展成为组织的分裂。
    党提高了马克思列宁主义的觉悟，加强了对于实际情况的调查研究工作，扩大了党内民主，并且对于工作中的错误采取了正确的方针，这样，党的团结和统一就必然日益巩固。而党的团结和统一，当然不但是我们党本身的利益，而且是整个工人阶级和全国人民的利益，因为党是整个工人阶级和全国人民群众的领导核心。
    我们要巩固地团结全党，目的正是为了巩固地团结整个工人阶级和全国人民群众。我们的全部力量的源泉在于我们能够密切地依靠工人阶级和人民群众。为了把我国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义国家，我们必须用最大的努力继续加强党和群众的团结。
    我国最广大的群众已经组织起来。各种群众组织是我们党联系群众的必要的纽带。除开前面已经说过的农民所组织的合作社以外，最重要的群众组织就是工会组织、青年团组织和妇女组织。
    我国工会组织现在已经拥有一千二百万会员，它在国家建设中发挥了重大的作用。党应当加强对工会工作的领导，通过工会工作把我国工人阶级培养成为一个有组织的、有觉悟的、有文化技术的阶级，使广大的工人群众紧密地团结在党的周围。工会组织在社会主义建设事业中，一方面，应当用说服教育的方法吸引工人群众，通过社会主义竞赛和先进生产者运动为不断提高劳动生产率而斗争；另一方面，还应当密切关心群众的生活，发挥群众的监督作用，向一切企业中违法乱纪、侵害群众利益、不关心群众生活的官僚主义现象进行勇敢的斗争。忽视这两种任务的任何一方面的倾向，都是错误的，都应当纠正。
    已经拥有二千万团员的中国新民主主义青年团，最近即将改名为中国共产主义青年团。由于青年团在过去几年中的有成效的努力，在我国生气勃勃的青年职工、青年农民、青年科学技术人员和其他青年知识分子中，正在源源不绝地生长着社会主义事业的突击力量，并且向党输送着大批的新党员。青年团应当在党的领导下，在团员和广大青年群众中开展更加生动的思想工作和组织工作，克服某些团组织不注意采取适合青年特点的工作方式，不用说服教育方法去发扬青年群众的积极性和主动性的缺点。
    我们党一贯地关怀和支持妇女解放运动，把妇女的彻底解放看做我们事业的重要目标之一。我国妇女群众现在在工农业劳动中和其他许多社会职业部门中，正在占有日益重要的地位。各种工作岗位上的女干部正在迅速地成长。党应当继续鼓舞妇女群众的上进心，帮助她们克服参加工作的某些特有的困难，帮助她们提高工作的熟练程度，纠正党内外一切歧视妇女的错误思想，并且注意在社会生活和家庭生活中树立男女平等和保护妇女儿童的新的道德风尚。已经在全国各地建立了组织的民主妇女联合会是广大妇女的群众组织，党应当关心和帮助它的工作，通过它来加强党和妇女群众的联系。
    为了巩固我们党同人民群众的亲密联系，必须继续加强我们在各方面群众中的工作，尤其是必须在全体干部和党员中反复地进行全心全意为人民服务的教育。一个好党员、一个好领导者的重要标志，在于他熟悉人民的生活状况和劳动状况，关心人民的痛痒，懂得人民的心；他坚持艰苦朴素的作风，同人民同甘苦共患难，能够接受人民的批评监督而不在人民面前摆任何架子；他有事找群众商量，群众有话也愿意同他说。只要我们的党是由这样的党员组成的，我们就永远有无穷无尽的、不可征服的力量。
    如同我们党在国内依靠着我国人民群众的支持一样，在国际上，我们依靠着各国无产阶级的支持，依靠着各国人民的支持。如果没有各国无产阶级的伟大的国际主义的团结，如果没有国际革命力量的支持，我们的社会主义事业是不能胜利的，胜利了，要巩固，也是不可能的。
    我们必须继续加强同各国共产党、工人党的兄弟团结，必须继续向苏联共产党和其他一切国家的共产党学习他们的革命经验和建设经验。对待任何兄弟党，都必须采取热情的和谦虚的态度，必须坚决反对任何大国主义和资产阶级民族主义的危险倾向。
    中国革命是国际无产阶级革命事业的一部分。在我们的成就里面，包含着各国工人阶级和劳动人民的奋斗的成果。中国共产党中央委员会在此谨向各国兄弟党，并且经过他们向各国工人阶级和劳动人民，致以衷心的感谢和敬意，并且保证同他们永远团结一致。
    让我们全党同志永远团结在一起！让我们永远同全国人民群众团结在一起，永远同各国工人阶级和全世界人民团结在一起！我们的伟大的社会主义事业一定要胜利，世界上没有任何力量可以阻止我们的胜利！
