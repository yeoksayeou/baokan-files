Xinhua News Agency, Manila, September 2nd: According to the "Manila Chronicle," news that the United States insisted on retaining extraterritorial rights in the negotiations to amend the US-Philippines Military Base Agreement has aroused strong reactions in Philippine political circles. Many members of Congress issued statements on August 28 criticizing the US stance and questioning the US-promoted idea of a "special relationship" between the US and the Philippines.

Senator Conleon said that sharing jurisdiction with the United States would be "creating another republic within a republic."

He said that Americans come to the Philippines only as "special guests," and they should not "dictate to us what should be done in our country."

Philippine Senate Finance Committee Chairman, Senator Puyat, said that the issue of jurisdiction is the most important. If the Philippines gives up this right, "it would be another sacrifice of national dignity, succumbing to US pressure."

Another Senator, Sabido, said that the attitude expressed by the Philippine representatives on the issue of jurisdiction represents the opinion of all Filipinos.

Senator Lorenzo Sumulong said that if the US negotiators want to eliminate obstacles to understanding between the Philippines and the United States, they should unhesitatingly withdraw all demands regarding jurisdiction and recognize that jurisdiction is the sole prerogative of the Philippine government. He believes that the US cannot abuse the concept of a "special relationship" between the US and the Philippines and regard Filipinos as inferior.

Arturo Tolentino, Chairman of the Special Committee of the Philippine House of Representatives responsible for re-examining Philippine-US relations, said: "We cannot accept that our special relationship with the United States means that the Philippines must be treated as a semi-dependent country."

Tolentino said that the United States has clearly stated that it recognizes Philippine sovereignty, but unless it allows the Philippines to exercise its jurisdiction, "this so-called recognition (of sovereignty) will only be a mockery."

Representative Castañeda, a majority member of the Special Committee headed by Tolentino, believes that it would be better for the Philippines if there were no such "special relationship" and the Philippines could discuss issues with the United States on an equal footing commensurate with two sovereign states.

Representative Marcos, a minority member of this special committee, also called on the United States in his speech to show that it allows the Philippines to fully exercise its sovereignty.

Another congressman who advocates re-examining US-Philippine relations, Roses, said: "From the US point of view, it seems that this so-called special relationship is a one-sided affair, and the United States always plays the role of big brother and protector."

The "Manila Chronicle" published an editorial on August 28, saying: "The United States' insistence on its demand for extraterritorial rights exposes the hypocrisy of its own statement of respecting Philippine sovereignty."

    菲议员不满美国蔑视菲主权
    指责美国坚持享有治外权是把菲律宾当作半附属国
    据新华社2日讯　马尼拉消息：据“马尼拉纪事报”报道，美国在修改美菲军事基地协定的谈判中坚持要保有治外法权的消息，在菲律宾政界中引起了强烈的反应。许多国会议员在8月28日发表谈话指责美国方面所持的态度，并且对美国所宣传的美国和菲律宾存在“特别关系”的说法提出了质问。
    参议员康莱昂说，同美国共享裁判权将是“在一个共和国里制造另一个共和国”。
    他说，美国人到菲律宾来只是作为“特别的客人”，他们不应该“下命令告诉我们在我们的国家里应该作什么”。
    菲律宾参议院财政委员会主席、参议员普雅特发表谈话说，裁判权问题是最重要的问题，菲律宾如果放弃这个权利，“那就是再一次牺牲国家的尊严，屈服于美国压力之下”。
    另一个参议员萨比多说，菲律宾代表在裁判权问题上所表示的态度，表达了全体菲律宾人民的意见。
    参议员洛伦佐·苏木朗说，如果要消除菲律宾和美国之间取得谅解的障碍的话，美国的谈判代表应该毫不犹豫地撤消关于裁判权的一切要求，并且承认裁判权是菲律宾政府所独有的。他认为美国不能滥用美国和菲律宾之间存在“特别关系”这个概念，把菲律宾人看成是低一等的。
    菲律宾众议院负责重新审查菲律宾和美国关系的特别委员会的主席阿图罗·托伦蒂诺说：“我们不能够承认：我国和美国的特别关系是意味着必须把菲律宾当作一个半附属国。”
    托伦蒂诺说，美国是明白表示过它承认菲律宾主权的，但是除非它让菲律宾行使它的裁判权，“不然，这种所谓（对主权的）承认将仅仅是一种嘲弄”。
    参加以托伦蒂诺为首的特别委员会的多数派委员、众议员卡斯塔尼达认为，如果没有这种“特别关系”菲律宾就能够和美国在同两个主权国家相称的平等基础上来讨论问题的话，那对菲律宾会好一些。
    这个特别委员会的少数派委员、众议员马尔科斯在谈话中也要求美国表明它让菲律宾充分行使它的主权。
    另一个主张重新审查美菲关系的众议员罗赛斯说：“从美国的观点看来，似乎这种所谓特别关系是单方面的事情，而美国总是扮演老大哥和保护人的角色”。
    “马尼拉纪事报”8月28日发表社论说：“美国坚持它的治外法权的要求，这就揭穿了它自己表示要尊重菲律宾主权的话的虚伪性”。
