Xinhua News Agency, Jilin, 12th. (Xinhua News Agency reporter Kang Guozhi report): The major projects of the Fengman Hydroelectric Station reconstruction project, the largest hydroelectric station in China, during the First Five-Year Plan period have now been completed. After a thorough reconstruction, the Fengman Hydroelectric Station, equipped with new-style automated giant hydraulic turbine generators and increased installed capacity, has become a modern large-scale hydroelectric power station.

　　Now, the reconstructed Fengman Hydroelectric Station dam stands majestically between two high mountains on the banks of the Songhua River, holding a large amount of power generation "raw material" - nearly 10 billion cubic meters of river water, forming a calm reservoir. The head of the reservoir is in Fengman, and the tail extends along the main stream of the Songhua River to Huadian County, about 200 kilometers long, with an area of more than 480 square kilometers. During the flood season, opening the dam spillway gates, the man-made waterfall flying down from a height of dozens of meters, the water flow jumps up dozens of meters high after passing through the "leaping sill", showing a stream of parabolic jet flow and a splash of water, rippling waves on the river, wisps of mist rising in the air, showing countless rainbows in the sun, which is magnificent.

　　The Fengman Hydroelectric Station gravity dam, which relies on its own weight to hold the river water, was not fully completed when the Japanese imperialists operated this hydroelectric station, and the quality of the project was very poor. The dam body was also destroyed by the Kuomintang reactionaries. Leakage and seepage in the dam body and dam foundation were serious, and it was even more dangerous in the event of a major flood. The reconstruction of the Fengman Hydroelectric Station dam began before the implementation of China's First Five-Year Plan and has been fully completed this year. In the past few years, more than 200,000 cubic meters of concrete have been poured into the damaged and weak parts of the dam body, and the original block-shaped dam body has been firmly connected into a whole with thick and long round steel bars, enhancing the firmness of the dam; a large amount of cement slurry has been drilled and poured into the dam body and dam foundation, and the cement slurry has spread inside, forming a "anti-seepage curtain" after solidification, preventing the penetration and erosion of river water. After the test of the extraordinary floods this year and in 1953, the reservoir water level approached and reached the design height several times. According to instrument measurements and scientific calculations, it was concluded not long ago: the dam is firm and stable, and the original danger has been eliminated.

　　From one side of the plant under the dam, there are eddies of turbulence surging against the turbines. The tall and bright plant emits a large amount of electricity every minute. The automated giant hydraulic turbine generators stipulated to be installed during the First Five-Year Plan period have all been installed by August this year. The original old hydraulic turbine generators will also soon be fully converted into automated units. These electrically automatically controlled hydraulic turbine generators do not require manual operation. Each shift only has five duty operators who directly manage all the hydraulic turbine generators. Before the reconstruction, although there were fewer machines than now, because the equipment was mostly operated manually, there were 20 duty personnel in each shift.

　　In the recent year or two, the Fengman Hydroelectric Station has also absorbed many new technologies in the power industry to further improve the degree of automation and has added some safety protection devices.

　　According to the needs of industrial development in Northeast China, the reconstruction of the Fengman Hydroelectric Station is being accelerated with the comprehensive assistance of the Soviet Union. The installed capacity this year has increased by about three times compared with 1952, and corresponding power transmission and transformation equipment has been installed. By the end of this year, after the completion of some scattered projects, the projects of the First Five-Year Plan period for the reconstruction of the Fengman Hydroelectric Station will be fully completed according to plan.

　　After another giant hydraulic turbine generator is installed and a contact substation is built, the Fengman Hydroelectric Station will complete all reconstruction tasks, and the power generation capacity will reach 567,000 kilowatts.

    建丰满水电站加速进行改
    第一个五年计划期间改建的主要工程已全部完成
    新华社吉林12日电  新华社记者康国志报道：我国目前最大的水电站——丰满水电站改建工程中第一个五年计划时期的主要工程项目，现在已经完成了。经过彻底改建的丰满水电站，安装了新式自动化巨型水轮发电机，增加了装机容量，成为一座现代化的大型水力发电站。
    现在经过改建的丰满水电站拦河坝，雄踞松花江畔两座高山之间，拦蓄着大量的发电“原料”——近百亿立方公尺江水，形成一个平静的大水库。水库的头部在丰满，尾部沿着松花江干流延伸到桦甸县城，长约二百公里，面积四百八十多平方公里。洪汛时期，启开拦河坝溢流门，从几十公尺高空飞腾下降的人造瀑布，水流经过“跃水槛”就跃起几十公尺高，出现一股股抛弧线形射流和一片水花，江面上掀起涟涟浪波，空中升起缕缕气雾，在阳光下显现出无数彩虹，壮丽异常。
    依靠自身重量拦蓄江水的丰满水电站重力式拦河坝，在日本帝国主义者经营这个水电站时没有全部建成，工程质量很坏，坝体还遭受到国民党反动派的破坏。坝内、坝基漏水、渗水严重，逢遇特大洪水更是危险万状。丰满水电站拦河坝的改建，在我国第一个五年计划施行以前就着手进行了，今年已经全部完成。几年来，坝身残缺的薄弱部分浇灌了二十多万立方公尺混凝土，并把原来分成块状的坝身用粗长的圆钢牢固地联结成为一体，增强了拦河坝的坚固性；坝体和坝基钻孔灌入大量水泥浆，水泥浆在其内部扩散开来，凝固后形成了“防渗帷幕”，防止江水的渗透和侵蚀。经过今年和1953年特大洪水的考验，水库水位曾几度接近和达到设计高度，根据仪器的测量和科学的计算，不久前已经做出结论：拦河坝坚固、稳定，原来的危险消除了。
    由拦河坝下厂房的一侧，翻腾着一股股冲动涡轮的漩涡。高大明亮的厂房内分秒不停地发出大量的电力。第一个五年计划时期规定安装的自动化巨型水轮发电机，到今年8月已经全部安装完成了。原有的旧式水轮发电机也快要全部改装成为自动化的机组。这些电气自动控制的水轮发电机，不用人工操作。每班直接管理全部水轮发电机的值班运行人员，只有五人。改建前，虽然机器比现在少得多，但是由于设备多用人工操作，每班值班人员却有二十人。
    最近一、二年内，丰满水电站还吸取电力工业方面的许多新技术，进一步提高了自动化程度，并且增设了一些安全保护装置。
    根据东北地区工业发展的需要，丰满水电站在苏联全面援助下加速进行改建。今年比1952年装机容量增加约有三倍，相应地装设了变电和送电设备。到今年年底一些零星工程完成后，改建丰满水电站的第一个五年计划时期的工程将全部按计划完成。
    以后再安装一台巨型水轮发电机和建设一座联络变电所，丰满水电站将完成全部改建任务，发电能力将达到五十六万七千瓩。
