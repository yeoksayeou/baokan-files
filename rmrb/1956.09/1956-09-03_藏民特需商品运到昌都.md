Xinhua News Agency, Qamdo, September 1st. These days, the state-owned Qamdo Trading Company's store is bustling with customers. The glass display cases are crowded all day with farmers, herders, and city residents purchasing pots, copper-plated water ladles, prayer beads, tobacco, and other goods that have recently arrived. The styles, colors, and materials of these goods are all in line with the habits and preferences of the Tibetan people. Recently, the Qamdo Trading Company also wholesaled a batch of such goods to Tibetan merchants, allowing them to take them to rural areas and pastures for sale.

The company will continue to expand the supply of special goods needed by the Tibetan people. Throughout the year, a batch of milk pots, stir-fried highland barley pots, butter tea kettles, silk waistbands, and other items that have already been ordered in the interior will be shipped successively.

    藏民特需商品运到昌都
    新华社昌都1日电　这几天，在国营昌都贸易公司门市部里，顾客盈门，玻璃橱柜前整天挤满了购买最近陆续运到的锅、镀铜水瓢、念珠、烟草等商品的农、牧民和市民。这些商品的式样、花色、原料都符合西藏人民的习惯和喜爱。昌都贸易公司最近还把一批这样的商品批发给藏族商人，让他们带到农村和牧场去销售。
    这个公司今后还要不断地扩大西藏人民特需商品的供应。年内将陆续运到一批已经在内地订制的奶锅、炒青稞锅、酥油茶壶、丝织腰带等。
