Xinhua News Agency, Karamay, 3rd - The Karamay Mining Bureau was officially established here on September 1st. The Mining Bureau has five departments including drilling, pilot production, and derrick installation, and seventeen sections including a planning section, geology section, and laboratory. In addition, the bureau is affiliated with units such as a mechanical repair factory and a hospital.

Qian Ping, Deputy Director of the Xinjiang Petroleum Administration, pointed out in a report at the inaugural meeting that since the first exploration well was drilled in the Karamay Oilfield in July of last year, the proven recoverable reserves of the oilfield have greatly exceeded the figures required for the entire Xinjiang region in the state's First Five-Year Plan. Next year, the scale of exploration and capital construction tasks in the Karamay Oilfield will greatly exceed this year. The original Karamay Drilling Office could no longer adapt to the development of the oilfield. The establishment of the Mining Bureau will better undertake the task of exploration and construction of this petroleum industrial base.

The Karamay Mining Area Committee of the Communist Party of China was also established on the same day.

People's Daily Karamay, 3rd - The Karamay Mining Bureau is taking emergency measures to accelerate winter protection and warmth preservation work.

Karamay is located on the northwestern edge of the Junggar Basin, where winter temperatures often reach around minus 40 degrees Celsius. There are only two months left before the freezing period. In order to ensure that employees can safely survive the winter and not affect winter production, the Karamay Mining Bureau, with the support of the whole country and the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, is stepping up its winter protection and warmth preservation work.

At present, the boilers and steam pipes needed for drilling have been continuously transported from the Northeast and abroad to Dushanzi. The industrial water for developing the oil area has been determined to be diverted from the Manas River to Karamay. The more than 40-kilometer-long water pipeline has been surveyed and is being designed. The water pipes are being continuously transported to the Manas River, and large trenching machines have also been installed. Installation workers from the Yumen Oil Mine will arrive at the construction site in the next few days to install the water pipes. The construction of more than 100 employee dormitories, offices, and houses needed for trade companies, post and telecommunications bureaus, the People's Bank of China, and Xinhua Bookstore planned to be built in Karamay and Ulho this year was once affected by a shortage of water, timber, and transportation vehicles. Recently, the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps and the Autonomous Region Transportation Bureau decided to transfer another batch of vehicles to support Karamay. The vehicles transferred by the Production and Construction Corps will be responsible for transporting timber from Anjihai on the northern foothills of the Tianshan Mountains. The highway from Dushanzi to Karamay will be fully opened to traffic in early September. After the full opening of this highway, the efficiency of car travel will be greatly improved. In the past, the bricks needed for building houses were affected by the slow progress of adobe making due to the lack of water in the Karamay area, and there was no time to dig wells. Recently, it was prepared to make adobe near the Manas River and then transport the dry adobe to Karamay. Now, the employees of Karamay are urgently mobilizing to accelerate winter protection and warmth preservation work.

    克拉玛依矿务局成立
    冬季防护保暖工作加速进行
    新华社克拉玛依3日电　克拉玛依矿务局9月1日在此间正式成立。矿务局下设有钻井、试采、井架安装等五个处和计划科、地质科、化验室等十七个科室。此外，这个局还附设有机械修理厂、医院等单位。
    新疆石油管理局副局长钱萍在成立大会上所作的报告中指出，克拉玛依油田从去年7月第一口探井开钻到今年8月底一年多以来，探明了的油田可采储量，已经大大超过了国家第一个五年计划中对全新疆地区所要求的数字。明年克拉玛依油田的勘探规模和基本建设任务，将大大超过今年。原来的克拉玛依钻探处已经不能与油田的发展情况相适应。矿务局的成立，将更好地负担起勘探与建设这一石油工业基地的任务。
    中国共产党克拉玛依矿区委员会，也在同日成立。
    本报克拉玛依3日电　克拉玛依矿务局正在采取紧急措施，加速冬季防护保暖工作。
    克拉玛依位于准噶尔盆地的西北边缘，冬季气温经常在摄氏零下四十度左右。目前距离封冻时期仅两个月，为了让职工能够安全过冬和不影响冬季生产，克拉玛依矿务局在全国和新疆维吾尔自治区支援下，正加紧进行冬季防护保暖工作。
    目前，钻井方面所需要的锅炉和蒸汽管等已经由东北和国外源源地运到独山子。开发油区的工业用水已经确定从玛纳斯河引到克拉玛依，这条长达四十多公里的水管线已测量完毕，正在设计。输水管正在陆续地运到玛纳斯河边，大型挖沟机也安装好了。玉门油矿的安装工人，最近几天内就可到达工地安装水管。计划今年在克拉玛依和乌尔禾等地修建的一百多幢职工宿舍、办公室以及贸易公司、邮电局、人民银行、新华书店所需要的房屋一度曾因缺水、缺乏木料和运输车辆影响了工程的进度，最近，新疆生产建设兵团和自治区运输局决定再抽调一批车辆来支援克拉玛依。生产建设兵团调拨的车辆将担任由天山北麓的安集海运输木料。从独山子到克拉玛依的公路，将在9月上旬全线通车，这条公路全线通车后，汽车的行车效率将大大提高。建筑房屋所需要的砖块，过去因为克拉玛依地区缺水，影响到打土坯的进度，也来不及开凿水井，最近准备在玛纳斯河附近打土坯，然后将干的土坯运到克拉玛依。现在，克拉玛依的职工们正紧急动员起来，加速进行冬季防护保暖工作。
