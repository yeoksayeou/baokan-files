According to the Shanghai Labor Daily, the sample-making team of the steam bubble workshop at the Shanghai Boiler Factory has saved 156 tons of steel in the first eight months of this year. The steel saved is enough to make approximately 1,900 double-wheeled, double-furrow plows.

The work of the sample-making team is the first process in the workshop's production. After the material is taken from the warehouse, they make the sample and draw lines before cutting the material. Therefore, the workers' soapstone pencils (the main tool for making samples) are like a tailor's scissors; carelessness will waste steel. Therefore, in their work, the workers conscientiously master the operational methods of "calculating accurately and using skillfully," carefully calculating the material, and repeatedly arranging and nesting the cuts to reduce residual material, so as to give full play to the utilization rate of the steel. If they find that modifying the drawing can save steel plate without affecting quality, they take the initiative to contact the material warehouse and the technical team to make modifications. Once, when sample-maker Gu Xigen was drawing lines for a steam bubble, considering that if he followed the drawing, the utilization rate of the entire steel plate would only be 70%, and the remaining steel could only be used as residual material, he discussed it with the design department and adopted the method of splicing whole pieces of material, ensuring quality while achieving a steel plate utilization rate of 95%.

Now, the steel plate utilization rate of this team has increased from 75% to 80% in the past to 90% to 95%. The workers are determined to exceed the target of "saving 200 tons of steel throughout the year" that they set at the beginning of the year.

    算得精用得巧提高钢板利用率
    据上海劳动报消息　上海锅炉厂汽泡车间的出样小组，在今年八个月中，已经节约了一百五十六吨钢材。这些节约的钢材，大约可以用来制造一千九百台双轮双铧犁。
    出样小组的工作是车间生产的第一道工序。材料出库，先由他们出样、划线，然后再落料加工，所以工人的石笔（出样时的主要工具）就好像裁缝师傅的一把剪刀，一不小心就会浪费钢材。因此，工人们在工作中，认真掌握“算得精、用得巧”的操作方法，仔细核算材料，划线时，反复拼排、套裁，减少余料，以充分发挥钢材利用率。如发现修改图样后可以节约钢板，而又不影响质量，他们就主动和材料库、技术组联系修改。有一次，出样工顾喜根做汽泡划线时，考虑到如果照图样做，整块钢板利用率只有70％，剩下的钢材只能作余料，他就和设计部门研究，在保证质量的前提下，采用整料拼接，使钢板利用率达到95％。
    现在，这个小组的钢板利用率已从过去的75％到80％，提高到90％到95％。工人们保证要突破他们在年初提出的“全年节约二百吨钢材”的指标。
