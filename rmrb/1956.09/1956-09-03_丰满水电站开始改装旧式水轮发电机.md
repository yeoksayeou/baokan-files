    Xinhua News Agency, Jilin, September 2nd – The oldest hydraulic turbine generator, No. 1, at the Fengman Hydropower Station began its retrofitting on the 1st and is expected to be completed in October.
    The No. 1 hydraulic turbine generator was obtained by the Japanese rulers of the puppet Manchukuo, who exchanged it for soybeans from the Northeast with the United States and Switzerland. This hydraulic turbine generator was the first unit to generate electricity at the Fengman Hydropower Station. The semi-automatic and semi-manual old-style No. 1 hydraulic turbine generator has many unreasonable or imperfect devices. After being retrofitted with technology, it will be basically the same as the new Soviet-style hydraulic turbine generators installed in recent years, becoming a new type of electrical control unit. When the duty personnel turn on the main switch, many parts of the unit will automatically open and generate electricity. In the fastest time, the power can be transmitted to the user in one or two minutes; while the old-style unit takes more than fifteen minutes. Because many manual operations have been replaced by electrical automatic control, accidents can also be avoided to the greatest extent.

    丰满水电站开始改装旧式水轮发电机
    据新华社吉林2日电　丰满水电站最老的一号水轮发电机，从一日开始进行改装，预计在10月份改装完成。
    一号水轮发电机，是伪满时期日本统治者用东北的大豆从美国和瑞士换取来的。这一台水轮发电机是丰满水电站最先发电的一部机组。半自动半手动旧式的一号水轮发电机，有许多装置不合理或不完善。采用技术进行改装以后，将和最近几年来安装的苏联新式水轮发电机基本相同，成为电气控制的新式机组。值班人员开动总开关，机组的许多环节就自动开启、发电，最快的时候在一两分钟以内，就能把电力输送到用户那里；而旧式机组，却要十五分钟以上。由于许多人工手动操作改为电气自动控制，还能最大限度地避免发生事故。
