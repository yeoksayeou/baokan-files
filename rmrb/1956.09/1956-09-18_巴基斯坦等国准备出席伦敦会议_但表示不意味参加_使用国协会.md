Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, September 17th: Pakistani Foreign Minister Malik Firoz Khan Noon issued a statement on the 16th saying that Pakistan's participation in the Western-sponsored London conference of the "Suez Canal Users' Association" does not mean joining the association.

The Pakistani Foreign Minister said, "Under no circumstances can we participate in actions involving the use of force, or support any solution imposed on Egypt against its wishes."

Noon's statement also said that Pakistan has also agreed to attend the international conference of canal-using nations proposed by Egypt to establish a negotiating body, "if the majority of countries receiving the same invitation agree to participate."

Xinhua News Agency, September 17th dispatch from Tehran: Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Ardalan said on September 16th that Iran had accepted the British invitation and decided to participate in the so-called Suez Canal Users' Association meeting to be held in London on September 19th. However, Iran will oppose any proposals for the use of force put forward at the London conference.

Ardalan said that Iran believes in the possibility of a peaceful solution to the Suez Canal issue. Iran's acceptance of the invitation to participate in the London conference "does not in any way mean that Iran fully adopts the views of the three Western powers, nor does it mean that Iran is bound by any obligations to them."

Xinhua News Agency, September 17th dispatch from Stockholm: After a meeting in Stockholm on the 16th, the foreign ministers of Sweden, Norway, and Denmark issued a joint communique stating that the three governments "are not prepared to make any prior decisions on their attitude towards the proposed plan to establish a 'Canal Users' Association'. However, because they are willing to contribute to studying all possibilities for reaching a peaceful settlement of the dispute, the ministers are prepared to recommend that their governments accept the invitation to attend the meeting (regarding the establishment of a 'Canal Users' Association' to be held in London on the 19th)."

The communique also stated: "The ministers unanimously agreed that the Suez issue has now reached the stage where it would be best to submit it to the United Nations."

    巴基斯坦等国准备出席伦敦会议  但表示不意味参加“使用国协会”
    新华社喀喇蚩17日电　巴基斯坦外交部长马利克·菲罗兹汗·努恩16日发表声明说，巴基斯坦参加西方召开的“运河使用国协会”伦敦会议绝不意味着参加这个协会。
    这位巴基斯坦外交部长说：“无论如何我们不能参加使用武力的行动，或者支持违反埃及愿望而强加在它身上的任何解决的办法”。
    努恩的声明还说，巴基斯坦同时也已经同意出席埃及建议召开的成立谈判机构的各运河使用国的国际会议，“倘若大多数得到同样邀请的国家表示同意参加的话”。
    据新华社17日讯　德黑兰消息：伊朗外交大臣阿里·阿达兰9月16日说，伊朗接受英国的邀请，决定参加9月19日在伦敦举行的所谓苏彝士运河使用国协会会议。但是，伊朗将要反对在伦敦会议上所提出的任何使用武力的建议。
    阿达兰说，伊朗相信苏彝士运河问题和平解决的可能性。伊朗接受关于参加伦敦会议的邀请，“无论如何并不意味着伊朗完全采取西方三国的观点，也不意味着伊朗同对它们的任何义务有关”。
    据新华社17日讯　斯德哥尔摩消息：瑞典、挪威、丹麦三国外交大臣16日在斯德哥尔摩举行会议后，发表联合公报说：三国政府“不准备事先就它们对建议中成立‘运河使用国协会’计划的态度作出任何决定。但是，由于他们愿意对研究一切达成和平解决纠纷的可能性作出贡献，大臣们准备建议政府接受出席（19日在伦敦举行的关于成立‘运河使用国协会’的）会议的邀请”。　　　
    公报还说：“大臣们一致同意，苏彝士问题在目前已经到了最好是把它提交联合国的阶段”。
