    Sichuan Literary and Art Circles Discuss Sichuan Opera Music Reform
    Xinhua News Agency News: The question of how to reform Sichuan Opera music has recently sparked heated debate among literary and art circles and opera enthusiasts in Chengdu and Chongqing. Many people have published articles in newspapers and periodicals, and cultural and drama circles in Chengdu and Chongqing have held symposiums.
    The focus of the debate is on whether or not music accompaniment should be added to Sichuan Opera Gaoqiang. Traditionally, Sichuan Opera Gaoqiang operas have no musical accompaniment in their arias. In the past two years, many musicians and drama workers have added musical accompaniment to some Gaoqiang operas. However, some people have different opinions on this. They believe that adding musical accompaniment to Sichuan Opera Gaoqiang, especially adding Western musical instrument accompaniment, can easily destroy the traditional characteristics of Gaoqiang's emotional exuberance, free rhythm, singing with speaking, and speaking with singing, hinder the creativity of the actors, and restrict the arias, easily producing the shortcoming of "one tune for everyone."
    The opinion of another group of people is: adding accompaniment to Gaoqiang can make Gaoqiang more musical. Adding accompaniment will not hinder the actor's free creation. Because when actors sing, each aria represents the thoughts and feelings of the characters in the play, they will not "improvise a song" on the spot, but will creatively create the aria in the process of creating the role, according to the prescribed tune. If the accompaniment is well added, the traditional characteristics of Gaoqiang will not be lost. They advocate that if accompaniment is to be added, all arias should be added. They also believe that Western musical instruments are not unusable, because musical instruments cannot absolutely determine the style, and the melody mainly determines the style.
    There is also a group of people who believe that adding accompaniment to Gaoqiang is possible, and that there have been certain achievements in the past, which have also been welcomed by many audiences. However, it should be decided which parts to add accompaniment and which parts not to add according to the development of the plot, specific characters or arias. This group of people believes that the style of Sichuan Opera music is not allowed to be destroyed. Similarly, the style of Sichuan Opera music is not allowed to be regarded as eternally不变的. They cite the history of the development of Sichuan Opera Gaoqiang music to illustrate that Sichuan Opera Gaoqiang music has developed. They believe that Western musical instruments can be used, but mainly ethnic musical instruments should be used.
    Now, the debate is still continuing. Everyone agrees that more experimental reforms should be carried out in the future to avoid premature promotion. Some people suggest in-depth research on the characteristics of Gaoqiang, and convene a special symposium to continue to explore these issues.

### 四川文艺界讨论川剧音乐改革

    四川文艺界讨论川剧音乐改革
    新华社讯川剧音乐应该怎样改革的问题，最近在成都、重庆的文艺界和戏剧爱好者中引起了热烈的争论。许多人在报刊上发表文章，成都、重庆文化、戏剧界都举行了座谈会。
    争论的焦点集中在川剧高腔应不应加音乐伴奏的问题上。传统的川剧高腔戏在唱腔中是没有音乐伴奏的。近两年来，许多音乐工作者、戏剧工作者在一些高腔戏中加上了音乐伴奏。但是，一部分人对此有了不同的意见。他们认为，川剧高腔加上音乐伴奏，特别是加上西洋乐器伴奏，就容易破坏高腔情感奔放、节奏自由、唱中有说、说中有唱等传统特色，妨碍演员的创造性，使唱腔受到束缚，容易产生“千人一腔”的缺点。
    另一部分人的意见是：高腔加伴奏可以使高腔更富于音乐性。加伴奏不会妨碍演员的自由创造。因为演员唱戏，每一腔都代表剧中人物的思想感情，他不会临时“信口作歌”，而是在创造角色的过程中，按照剧本指定的曲牌，融会地创造唱腔。伴奏加得好，也不会失去高腔的传统特点。他们主张，要加伴奏就需要全部唱腔都加。他们还认为西洋乐器并不是不能用，因为乐器并不能绝对决定风格，主要是曲调决定风格。
    还有一部分人认为：高腔加伴奏是可以的，而且过去作的有一定的成绩，也受到许多观众的欢迎。但是应该根据剧情的发展、具体的人物或唱腔，来决定哪些地方加伴奏，哪些地方不加。这部分人认为：川剧音乐的风格，不允许破坏。同样，也不允许把川剧音乐的风格看成永恒不变的。他们列举川剧高腔音乐发展的历史，来说明川剧高腔音乐是有发展的。他们认为西洋乐器可以用，但主要应该用民族乐器。
    现在，争论还在继续展开中。大家都同意今后应多做试验性改革，避免过早地推广。有些人建议深入研究高腔特点，专门召开座谈会，继续探讨这些问题。
