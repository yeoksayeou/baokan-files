Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, September 26th: According to the Indian Press Trust, Prime Minister Nehru of India held a two-hour meeting with King Saud of Saudi Arabia on September 25th. They discussed Saudi Arabia's economic development and international issues, including the Suez Canal issue.

Upon arrival, Nehru, accompanied by Prince Faisal, traveled by car to the royal palace, where he had a brief conversation with King Saud. Sources said that the King and Faisal conveyed to Nehru the strong sentiments of the Arab countries on the Suez issue.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, September 26th: According to the Indian Press Trust, Indian Prime Minister Nehru said in Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia, on September 25th, "I believe that if Egypt's full rights to the Suez Canal are recognized, and the right of the Suez Canal to be treated as an international waterway is also recognized, then there will be no difficulty in seeking a peaceful, friendly and cooperative solution."

Nehru said at a public welcoming rally, "There is no doubt, and everyone agrees, that the Suez Canal is an inseparable part of Egypt. Everyone agrees that the Suez Canal is an international waterway and that it should be open to ships of all countries. If these are agreed upon, then I don't understand why there is so much talk and debate."

    尼赫鲁总理和沙特国王会谈
    讨论沙特阿拉伯经济发展和苏伊士问题
    新华社新德里26日电　据印度报业托辣斯利雅得消息：印度总理尼赫鲁在9月25日同沙特阿拉伯国王沙特举行了两小时会谈。他们讨论了沙特阿拉伯的经济发展问题和国际问题，包括苏伊士运河问题。
    尼赫鲁是在前一天晚上乘飞机到达沙特阿拉伯的首都利雅得进行为期三天的访问。他在机场受到了沙特阿拉伯首相费萨尔亲王和成千上万的人的热烈欢迎。
    尼赫鲁对欢迎的人说：“我是作为一个和平的朝香客来到你们这个著名的国土的”。
    在到达后，尼赫鲁在费萨尔亲王的陪同下乘汽车到王宫，在那里他同沙特国王作了简短的谈话。消息说，国王和费萨尔把阿拉伯国家在苏伊士问题上的强烈情绪告诉了尼赫鲁。
    新华社新德里26日电　据印度报业托辣斯报道，印度总理尼赫鲁9月25日在沙特阿拉伯首都利雅得说，“我认为，承认了埃及对苏伊士运河的充分权利，而且也承认了苏伊士运河被作为国际水道对待的权利，那么寻求和平、友好和合作的解决办法就将没有困难”。
    尼赫鲁在一个公众欢迎会上说，“毫无疑问，而且每个人都同意，苏伊士运河是埃及不可分割的一部分。每个人都同意苏伊士运河是一条国际水道，它应该向所有国家的船只开放。如果这些都同意了，那么我就不了解为什么还有那么多议论和争辩。”
    尼赫鲁在9月25日同沙特阿拉伯国王沙特和首相费萨尔分别举行会谈。当天他还参观了沙特阿拉伯的新成立的军事学院和名胜古迹。
