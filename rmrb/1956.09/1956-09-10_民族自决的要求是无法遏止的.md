"Island of Love" - this is what the ancient Greeks called Cyprus. According to Greek mythology, Aphrodite, the goddess of love and beauty, came to this island on golden sea waves.

Today, this beautiful and picturesque island in the eastern Mediterranean is filled with the smell of gunpowder. Batch after batch of planes and ships have brought in large numbers of fully armed British Royal soldiers. With the consent of Britain, French troops have also recently begun to arrive here in succession. The British and French colonialists are using the birthplace of the goddess of love and beauty as a military base, attempting to force Egypt to accept the "internationalization" plan for the Suez Canal.

While menacing Egypt with military blackmail, the British colonialists have become even more ferocious on the Cyprus issue. They have brazenly stifled the hope for a peaceful resolution to the Cyprus issue that recently emerged.

As everyone knows, the British government’s brutal exile of Archbishop Makarios of Cyprus and other leaders of the Cypriot national liberation movement in March of this year led to the interruption of negotiations for a peaceful resolution of the Cyprus issue. The British colonialists then deployed troops and intensified their armed suppression of the Cypriot people who demanded to get rid of British colonial rule. While implementing a reign of terror, they attempted to blame the armed struggle of the Cypriot people against colonial repression. They cursed the Cypriot patriots as "terrorists" and emphasized that negotiations could only resume after "the restoration of law and order."

On August 16, the Cypriot patriotic organization "EOKA" (National Organization of Cypriot Fighters) announced a temporary cessation of all armed anti-British activities, demanding that the British authorities take corresponding steps to restart negotiations for a peaceful resolution of the Cyprus issue. However, Britain still refused to open the door to resuming negotiations.

"Surrender now!" Marshal Harding, the British Governor of Cyprus, issued an "ultimatum." This "ultimatum" demanded that all Cypriot patriots engaged in armed resistance lay down their arms and surrender to the British authorities before September 12. "Surrenderers" had two paths to choose: either exile for life or imprisonment.

Immediately afterwards, the British authorities began new suppression operations. At the end of August, the residence of the Mayor of Nicosia, Cyprus, was searched by British military police, and Anthimos, the leader of the Church Committee, was placed under house arrest by the British authorities. On September 5, Nikos Kranidiotis, the Director-General of the Church Committee, was also arrested by the British authorities.

Thus, people saw the logic of Downing Street: if the Cypriot people engage in armed resistance against the colonialist reign of terror, that is using violence, and Britain cannot agree to negotiate the issue of self-determination; if the Cypriot people are willing to stop the armed struggle and start peaceful negotiations, then they should surrender before talking about self-determination. In any case, the Cypriot people must succumb and obediently submit to the dictates of the British colonialists.

What strange logic! But it is simple to explain: in the eyes of the colonialists, the right to national self-determination of the colonial people is nothing, and only their colonial interests are paramount. British Prime Minister Sir Anthony Eden has publicly stated more than once that occupying Cyprus is absolutely necessary to "defend" British oil interests in the Middle East. Not long ago, a booklet distributed by the British authorities to British soldiers stationed in Cyprus stated more specifically: Cyprus is the "nerve center of Britain's Middle East strategy" and a "stepping stone for any military and air operations that Britain may take in the Middle East." There is not the slightest place for the right to national self-determination of the Cypriot people in this. In the eyes of British colonialists, Cyprus is an important strategic base for supporting the colonial empire and suppressing national independence movements in the Middle East. The fact that Britain and France are currently assembling troops in Cyprus to carry out military threats against Egypt most powerfully proves this point.

However, the Cypriot people are unwilling to let the colonialists arrange their destiny. Among the residents of Cyprus, those of Greek descent account for 80%. For a long time, they have been demanding to get rid of colonial rule. Even the London "Times" admitted: "This demand is as old as British rule, and even older." Especially in recent years, under the impact of the torrent of national liberation movements, the Cypriot people have actively launched a struggle for the right to self-determination. Their slogan is: "Enosis" - return to the embrace of Greece.

The British colonial rulers have stationed tens of thousands of armed military police on this island, using martial law, searches, fines, imprisonment, and even the terror of "shoot to kill" to deal with the peaceful residents of the island. However, bloody armed suppression cannot frighten the Cypriot people. While carrying out bloody suppression of the Cypriot people, the British colonialists have boasted about formulating a "constitution" to promote counterfeit "autonomy." This clumsy trick cannot deceive the Cypriot people either. The Cypriot people's struggle against colonial rule has become increasingly powerful.

This time, the British government's unreasonable attitude of refusing to resume negotiations has further strengthened the Cypriot people's will to fight. Harding's proposed "surrender conditions" have been unanimously protested by the Cypriot people; in the village of Kalogria, residents also held demonstrations. Despite the new suppression actions taken by the British authorities, the activities of the underground organization "EOKA" have increased. On September 2, a huge slogan of this organization appeared on a house near a square in Nicosia, reading: "Harding says that 'EOKA' will be finished in six months. But 'EOKA' is still strong." At the same time, the organization's message to the audience was broadcast in an open-air cinema. A newly established underground organization, the "EOKA Political Committee," is constantly carrying out activities. In leaflets distributed by this organization, it warned the British colonial authorities that the Cypriot people are all participating in the struggle against slavery and for freedom, and if Harding intends to arrest and imprison the members of "EOKA," then he must imprison all Cypriots.

The Cypriot people's struggle against colonial repression has received widespread support from world public opinion. In particular, the Greek people are giving full support to the self-determination demands of their Cypriot compatriots. When the British colonial authorities brutally hanged two Cypriot youths in May, all of Greece lowered its flags to half-mast for three days as a "powerful silent protest" against Britain. At a NATO air base on the island of Crete, two thousand Greek workers went on strike to protest the atrocities of the British authorities. This time, Britain's refusal to negotiate has aroused even more indignation among the Greek people. At the end of August, the Greek representative to the United Nations sent a letter to the UN Secretary-General, severely condemning Harding's "shameful ultimatum" and stating that "Greece is more determined than ever to demand that the UN General Assembly discuss the Cyprus issue." Even in Britain, the British government's unreasonable attitude has been universally opposed by public opinion. Not long ago, the British "News Chronicle" pointed out: "If the government has any sanity, it must know that its policy is becoming increasingly unpopular in this country and in Cyprus." When the British Parliament met in July, Labor members criticized the government's policy in Cyprus. Recently, the British Liberal Party issued a communique demanding the rapid resumption of negotiations.

The bloody struggle in Cyprus continues. The future is clear: if Britain stubbornly refuses to recognize the Cypriot people's right to self-determination and insists on acting arbitrarily, it will only make its situation more and more embarrassing; and the Cypriot people will surely achieve victory and realize their national aspirations. There have been many precedents for this, and this trend is now more unstoppable than ever.

    民族自决的要求是无法遏止的
    袁先禄
    “爱之岛”——这是古代希腊人民对塞浦路斯的称呼。因为，根据希腊神话，爱与美的女神厄茀萝达蒂就是乘着黄金色的海浪来到这个岛屿上的。
    今天，地中海东部这个风光绮丽、景色如画的海岛，却弥漫着一片火药气味。一批批的飞机和船只，运来了大量全副武装的英国皇家子弟兵。在英国的同意下，法国军队在最近也开始陆续开到了这里。英法的殖民主义者把爱与美的女神的降生地作为军事基地，企图逼迫埃及接受苏彝士运河“国际化”的计划。
    在向埃及人民剑拔弩张地进行军事讹诈的同时，英国殖民主义者在塞浦路斯问题上也更加凶相毕露了。他们悍然扼杀了最近出现的和平解决塞浦路斯问题的希望。
    大家知道，由于英国政府在今年3月横蛮地放逐了塞浦路斯马卡里奥斯大主教和塞浦路斯民族解放运动的其他领袖，就使得和平解决塞浦路斯问题的谈判中断了。英国殖民主义者接着就调兵遣将，对要求摆脱英国殖民统治的塞浦路斯人民加紧武力镇压。他们在实施恐怖统治的时候，却企图把责任归之于塞浦路斯人民反抗殖民镇压的武装斗争。他们骂塞浦路斯的爱国者是“恐怖分子”，并且强调只有在“恢复法治和秩序”以后才有可能恢复谈判。
    8月16日，塞浦路斯爱国者的组织“为塞浦路斯而斗争”宣布暂时停止一切武装反英活动，要求英国当局采取相应的步骤，重新开始和平解决塞浦路斯问题的谈判。但是，英国却仍然拒绝打开恢复谈判的大门。
      “现在投降吧！”塞浦路斯英国总督哈定元帅发出了一个“最后通牒”。这个“最后通牒”要求一切从事武装反抗的塞浦路斯爱国者在9月12日以前放下武器向英国当局投降。“投降者”有两条道路可以选择：一条是终生流亡，另一条是监禁。
    紧接着，英国当局又开始了新的镇压行动。8月底，塞浦路斯尼科西亚市长的住宅受到英国军警的搜查，教会委员会领袖安戴莫斯被英国当局所软禁。9月5日，教会委员会的总干事尼科斯·克拉尼迪奥蒂斯又被英国当局逮捕了。
    于是，人们看到了唐宁街的逻辑：如果塞浦路斯人民对殖民主义的恐怖统治进行武装反抗，那是使用暴力，英国不能同意谈判自决的问题；如果塞浦路斯人民愿意停止武装斗争，开始和平谈判，那就应该投降，然后再谈自决问题。左右逢源，总之塞浦路斯人民必须屈服，温顺地听英国殖民主义者摆布。
    多末奇怪的逻辑呀！但是说穿了也很简单：在殖民主义者的心目中，殖民地人民的民族自决权利根本算不了什么，只有他们的殖民利益才是至高无上的东西。英国首相艾登爵士就曾经不止一次地公开说，为了“保卫”英国在中东的石油利益，占领塞浦路斯是绝对必要的。不久以前英国当局向驻在塞浦路斯的英国士兵散发的一种小册子里说得更具体：塞浦路斯是英国“中东战略的神经中枢”，是英国“可能在中东采取任何军事行动和空中行动的跳板”，这中间没有塞浦路斯人民民族自决权利的丝毫地位。在英国殖民主义者看来，塞浦路斯是支撑殖民帝国、镇压中东民族独立运动的一块重要战略基地。目前英法在塞浦路斯集结军队，对埃及实行武力威胁，最有力地证明了这一点。
    然而，塞浦路斯人民不愿意让殖民主义者来安排他们的命运。在塞浦路斯居民中，希腊血统的占80％。他们长期以来一直要求摆脱殖民统治。连伦敦“泰晤士报”也承认：“这种要求和英国的统治一样由来已久，甚至还要久一些。”特别是近年来，在各个民族解放运动的洪流的冲击下，塞浦路斯人民积极展开了争取自决权利的斗争。他们的口号是：“意诺西斯”——回到希腊的怀抱。
    英国殖民统治者在这个岛上驻扎了数万武装军警，用戒严、搜捕、罚款、监禁以至“格杀勿论”的恐怖手段来对付岛上的和平居民。但是，血腥的武装镇压吓不倒塞浦路斯人民。英国殖民者在对塞浦路斯人民进行血腥镇压的同时，大吹大擂要制定什么“宪法”，来推销冒牌货的“自治”。这种拙劣的遮眼手法也骗不过塞浦路斯人民。塞浦路斯人民反对殖民统治的斗争力量已经越来越强大了。
    这一次，英国政府拒绝恢复谈判的无理态度，更加强了塞浦路斯人民斗争的意志。哈定提出的“投降条件”，已经受到塞浦路斯人民的一致抗议；在卡洛格里亚村，居民们还举行了示威游行。尽管英国当局采取了新的镇压行动，“为塞浦路斯而斗争”地下组织的活动却有增无已。9月2日，尼科西亚一个广场附近的房子上出现了这个组织的巨幅标语，上面写道：“哈定说，‘为塞浦路斯而斗争’组织在六个月内就要完蛋。但是，‘为塞浦路斯而斗争’组织仍然是强大的。”与此同时，在一个露天电影院里也传出了这个组织向观众宣传的声音。一个新成立的地下组织“为塞浦路斯而斗争政治委员会”在不断进行着活动。这个组织在散发的传单中警告英国殖民当局说：塞浦路斯人民都参加反对奴役、争取自由的斗争，如果哈定打算逮捕和监禁“为塞浦路斯而斗争”组织的成员，那末他就必须监禁全体塞浦路斯人。
    塞浦路斯人民反对殖民镇压的斗争，受到了世界舆论的广泛支持。特别是希腊人民更是全力支持他们塞浦路斯同胞的自决要求。当英国殖民当局在5月份横暴地绞死两个塞浦路斯青年的时候，希腊各地下半旗致哀三天，作为对英国的“有力的沉默抗议”。在克里特岛一个北大西洋公约组织的空军基地，二千名希腊工人举行了罢工，来抗议英国当局的暴行。这次英国拒绝进行谈判，更引起了希腊人民的愤慨。8月底，希腊驻联合国代表在给联合国秘书长的信里严正地谴责了哈定的“可耻的最后通牒”，并且表示目前“希腊比以往任何时候更坚决要求联合国大会讨论塞浦路斯问题”。就是在英国国内，英国政府的无理态度受到舆论的普遍反对。不久以前英国“新闻纪事报”曾经指出：“如果政府还有一点清醒，它一定知道，它的政策在这个国家以及在塞浦路斯是越来越不得人心了。”在7月份英国议会开会的时候，工党的议员们指责了政府在塞浦路斯的政策。最近，英国自由党发表公报，要求迅速恢复谈判。
    塞浦路斯的流血斗争还在继续着。前途是很明显的：如果英国还是顽固地拒绝承认塞浦路斯人民的自决权利，决意孤行蛮干下去，它只会使自己的处境越来越狼狈；而塞浦路斯人民一定会得到胜利，实现他们的民族愿望。这样的事情已经有了许多前例，这种趋势现在是较以往任何时期更加无法遏止了。
