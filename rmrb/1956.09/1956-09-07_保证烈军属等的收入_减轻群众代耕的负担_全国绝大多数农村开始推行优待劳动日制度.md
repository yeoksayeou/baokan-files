Xinhua News Agency, 6th Dispatch: A new preferential treatment system to protect the lives of families of martyrs, families of soldiers, and revolutionary disabled soldiers—the system of preferential labor days—is beginning to be implemented in the vast majority of provinces (regions) and cities in rural areas across the country. According to incomplete statistics, currently, in ten provinces and cities including Shanxi, Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, Henan, Heilongjiang, Liaoning, Zhejiang, Beijing, and Tianjin, 60% to 90% or more of the townships have assessed the number of labor days that families of martyrs and soldiers should enjoy with preferential treatment down to the household level. In many other provinces (regions) and cities, with the exception of a few provinces, arrangements have been made for preferential labor days or evaluations have already been conducted in some areas. It is expected that the system can be basically implemented in townships and cooperatives around the autumn harvest.

The implementation of the preferential labor day system for families of martyrs, families of soldiers, and revolutionary disabled soldiers is to adapt to the new situation in rural areas after agricultural cooperation. After agricultural cooperation, the situation of private ownership of the means of production in rural areas has changed, and the old "substitute farming" system is no longer applicable. Because agricultural production cooperatives implement remuneration based on labor, the lives of families of martyrs and soldiers (including some revolutionary disabled soldiers) who have no or little labor power are relatively difficult. The preferential labor day system uses the number of labor days distributed to each person in the agricultural production cooperative each year as a standard. After deducting the labor days that families of martyrs and soldiers can obtain themselves, the agricultural production cooperative subsidizes the insufficient part to guarantee the lives of families of martyrs and soldiers. In Yuncheng County, Shandong Province, the 1,438 households of families of martyrs and soldiers who enjoyed preferential labor days this year generally reached the income that ordinary cooperative members received in the preliminary distribution during the wheat harvest. In Gaocheng County, Hebei Province, over 90% of the families of martyrs and soldiers who were cooperative members in 1,970 agricultural cooperatives and enjoyed preferential labor days had increased their income. After Yu Shufang, a martyr's family member in the Taiyanghong Agricultural Cooperative in Changshan Township, Laiyang County, Shandong Province, enjoyed preferential labor days, she received 1,003 jin of wheat and 148 jin of peas during the summer harvest, which was 450 jin more grain than when she enjoyed substitute farming before joining the cooperative last year. She happily told everyone she met: "The government and the cooperative really care about the families of martyrs and soldiers. From now on, my family will have no more difficulties in life."

Since the burden of substitute farming, which was previously borne by a few male laborers, has been changed to preferential labor days borne by all male and female cooperative members, the burden on the masses is also more reasonable. At present, due to the preferential labor day system and the fact that families of officers no longer need to enjoy preferential treatment after officers' salaries were changed to a fixed wage system, the burden on cooperative members is generally lighter than during substitute farming. According to statistics from 55 counties in Jin County, Ding County, Xingtai, Shulu, and Ji County in Hebei Province, the number of preferential labor days this year decreased by about 30% compared to the number of substitute farming workdays last year. In Luan County, there were a total of 553,330 substitute farming workdays last year, and this year there were 503,223 preferential labor days, a decrease of more than 50,000 workdays compared to last year, and is therefore welcomed by the broad masses of cooperative members.

### 保证烈军属等的收入　减轻群众代耕的负担  全国绝大多数农村开始推行优待劳动日制度

    保证烈军属等的收入　减轻群众代耕的负担
    全国绝大多数农村开始推行优待劳动日制度
    新华社6日讯　一种保障烈属、军属和革命残废军人生活的新的优抚制度——优待劳动日制度，正在全国绝大多数省（区）、市的农村中开始推行。据不完全统计，目前山西、河北、山东、江苏、河南、黑龙江、辽宁、浙江和北京、天津等十个省、市，已经有60％到90％以上的乡把烈属、军属应该享受优待的劳动日评定到户。其他许多省（区）、市，除个别省外，对优待劳动日也都作了布置或已经在部分地区进行评议，预计秋收前后基本上可以贯彻到乡、社。
    对烈属、军属和革命残废军人实行优待劳动日制度，是为了适应农业合作化后农村的新情况。农业合作化后，农村生产资料私有制的情况已有改变，旧的“代耕”制度已经不适用。由于农业生产合作社实行按劳取酬，无劳动力或缺乏劳动力的烈属、军属（包括一部分革命残废军人）的生活就比较困难。优待劳动日就是以农业生产合作社中每人每年所分得的劳动日数为标准，除去烈属、军属自己能得到的劳动日外，不足的部分由农业生产合作社补助，以保证烈属、军属的生活。山东省郓城县今年享受优待劳动日的一千四百三十八户烈属、军属，在麦收时，普遍达到了一般社员在预先分配中所得到的收入。河北省藁城县一千九百七十个农业社中享受优待劳动日的烈属、军属社员，90％以上都增加了收入。山东省莱阳县昌山乡太阳红农业社烈属于淑芳享受优待劳动日后，夏收时分到小麦一千零三斤、豌豆一百四十八斤，比去年入社前享受代耕时，多收入粮食四百五十斤。她高兴得逢人就说：“政府、合作社对烈军属真关心，从今以后，俺家生活再也没有困难了。”
    由于把过去少数男劳动力负担代耕改为全体男女社员负担优待劳动日，群众负担也更加合理。目前，由于优待劳动日制度和军官改为薪给制后家属不必再享受优待等原因，社员的负担比代耕时一般都有了减轻。据河北省晋县、定县、邢台、束鹿、蓟县等五十五个县的统计，今年优待劳动日数比去年代耕工减少了30％左右。滦县去年代耕工共五十五万三千三百三十个，今年优待劳动日为五十万三千二百二十三个，比去年减少了五万多个工，因而受到广大社员的欢迎。
