Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 8th - The latest issue of the "Blitz" weekly reports: President Gamal Abdel Nasser, when receiving "Blitz" weekly reporter Sharma, who recently visited him in Cairo, said: Egypt considers the Western countries' threat of using force if negotiations with the Menzies delegation fail as a "real threat, therefore, we are taking all necessary precautions."

Nasser said: "We will defend our country and our rights, and will fight to the death until our last drop of blood is shed. We will never agree to the 'internationalization of the Suez Canal.'"

In answering questions, he said that Dulles' proposal is "another form of international colonialism. I have said this in the past, and I still say it now. We will never allow this form of international colonialism."

Nasser expressed his gratitude to India and Prime Minister Nehru for their efforts to seek a peaceful resolution. He believes that Menon's plan provides hope for peace.

Nasser expressed his hope to hold another Asian-African conference immediately. He said: "As long as we hold such a conference immediately, it doesn't matter where it is held."

Nasser said: "Egypt wants peace. We believe in peaceful coexistence."

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo: It is announced that the talks between representatives of the "Five-Nation Suez Canal Committee" and Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser are adjourned for two days on September 6th and 7th, and the time of the next meeting has not yet been determined.

Xinhua News Agency, September 8th, Cairo: A spokesman for the "Five-Nation Suez Canal Committee," led by Menzies, said today that the committee has requested to hold another meeting with President Nasser. He said: "I want to state specifically that the talks have not reached the final stage, but are still continuing." The spokesman made this statement after the committee held a two-hour meeting this morning. The previous evening, the committee's spokesman had said that the talks between the Menzies delegation and Nasser "have completely ended" and may return to London on the 9th.

According to Reuters' report on the evening of the 7th, citing the views of most diplomatic circles in Cairo: The "Five-Nation Committee," after consulting with the British and American governments, is still trying to find a compromise solution. However, diplomats pointed out that even if a compromise solution can be reached, it will not be an agreement on major issues, but only leaving room for agreement so that Menzies can report to London and then carry out activities and hold possible further talks.

According to the well-known Egyptian journalist Muhammad Heikal in today's Al-Ahram weekly, although Nasser agreed on several issues during his talks with the "Five-Nation Committee," they still disagreed on the international management of the canal. Heikal cited several points of agreement:

One, the seriousness of the situation. Heikal said that Nasser explained that he could not be held responsible for this. The particular seriousness of the situation is the result of military mobilization against Egypt.

Two, the desire to seek a peaceful solution. Heikal said that Nasser had told the committee that he unreservedly advocated seeking a peaceful solution.

Three, the necessity of respecting Egyptian sovereignty.

Four, the necessity of maintaining complete freedom of navigation at all times for all ships of all countries, in accordance with the 1888 Convention.

Heikal talked about the differing opinions of the two sides and said: "Egypt does not agree with a proposal put forward by the (Five-Nation) Committee, which calls for the establishment of an administrative body to control the canal, with representatives from Egypt and other countries to be determined later participating. However, even on this issue, Egypt is not simply saying no. It has stated its views not only after considering its sovereignty but also after considering the actual situation of freedom of navigation on the canal."

    纳赛尔重申反对苏彝士运河国际化
    埃及正在采取一切措施预防英法的武力威胁
    “五国委员会”要求再同纳赛尔举行会谈
    新华社新德里8日电　最近一期的“闪电”周报报道：阿卜杜勒·纳赛尔总统接见最近在开罗访问他的“闪电”周报记者夏尔马的时候说：埃及认为西方国家表示在一旦它同孟席斯代表团的谈判失败时就要使用武力的威胁是“真正的威胁，因此，我们正在采取一切必要的预防措施”。
    纳赛尔说：“我们将保卫我们的国家和我们的权利，并且将作殊死斗争直到流尽我们的最后一滴血。我们决不同意“苏彝士运河的国际化。”
    他在答复问题的时候说：杜勒斯的建议是“国际殖民主义的另一种形式。我过去这样说过，现在还是这样说。我们决不容许这种形式的国际殖民主义”。
    纳赛尔对印度和印度总理尼赫鲁为谋求和平解决所作的努力表示感谢。他认为梅农提出的方案提供了和平的希望。
    纳赛尔表示希望立即再举行一次亚非会议。他说：“只要我们马上举行这种会议，不论在哪里举行都没有关系”。
    纳赛尔说：“埃及希望和平。我们相信和平共处。”
    据新华社讯　开罗消息：据宣布，“五国苏彝士运河委员会”的代表同埃及总统阿卜杜勒·纳赛尔的会谈在9月6日和7日休会两天，下次会议的时间还没有确定。
    新华社8日讯　开罗消息：以孟席斯为首的“五国苏彝士运河委员会”发言人今天说：委员会已经要求再和纳赛尔总统举行一次会谈。他说：“我要特别声明一下，会谈还没有达到最后阶段，而是仍然在继续。”发言人是在委员会今天早晨举行了两小时的会议后发表这一谈话的。在前一天的晚上，委员会的发言人曾经说，孟席斯代表团和纳赛尔的会谈“已经完全结束”，并且可能在9日回伦敦。
    据路透社7日晚援引开罗外交界大多数人士的看法说：“五国委员会”在同英、美两国政府商议后，仍在设法取得一个折衷办法。不过外交人士指出，即使能够达成折衷办法的话，也不是在重大问题上达成协议，而不过是为协议留下余地以便孟席斯向伦敦报告后再进行活动和举行可能的进一步会谈。
    据埃及著名的记者穆罕默德·黑卡尔在今天的今日消息周刊上说，纳赛尔在同“五国委员会”的会谈中虽然在若干问题上意见一致，但是在运河的国际管理上仍然是意见分歧的。黑卡尔举出意见一致的几点是：
    一、形势的严重性。黑卡尔说，纳赛尔说明了这不能由他负责。形势的特别严重是针对埃及的军事集结的结果。
    二、寻求和平解决的愿望。黑卡尔说，纳赛尔已经告诉委员会，他无保留地主张寻求和平解决。
    三、尊重埃及主权的必要性。
    四、根据1888年公约保持一切国家的一切船只，在一切时候的完全通航自由的必要性。
    黑卡尔谈到双方分歧的意见说：“埃及不同意（五国）委员会提出的一项建议，这项建议要求设立一个控制运河的行政机构，由埃及和以后再确定的其他一些国家派代表参加。但是，即使在这个问题上，埃及也不是单单说一个不字。它不仅在考虑了它的主权而且还考虑了运河航行自由的实际情况之后，已经说明了它的意见。
