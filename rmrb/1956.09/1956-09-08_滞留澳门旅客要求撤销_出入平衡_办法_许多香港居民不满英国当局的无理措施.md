Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, September 7th: Hong Kong News: Since the Hong Kong British authorities re-implemented the so-called "entry-exit balance" measure, nearly a hundred mainland travelers who passed through Macau to Hong Kong have been anxiously stranded in Macau.

    An elderly woman named Fan Chunke came from Shiqi via Macau, intending to visit her young granddaughter in Hong Kong. However, because the Hong Kong British authorities implemented the unreasonable "entry-exit balance" regulation on the 3rd, the Macau shipping company refused to sell her a ticket.

    Fan Chunke had already spent all her travel expenses, and had no relatives or friends in Macau. She was so anxious that she cried loudly outside the pier. A traveler named Liang Yuanlian from Enping told people in Macau that his relatives abroad had remitted him a sum of US dollars, and he needed to go to Hong Kong to collect it in person. Because of this entry restriction, he not only couldn't receive the remittance, but he almost ran out of travel expenses. A woman named Guo Guiying, who wanted to go to Hong Kong to collect her husband's life insurance money, was also stranded in Macau. She was very anxious, worried that she would miss the deadline and lose the money. The mainland travelers stranded in Macau all hope that the Hong Kong British authorities will revoke the "entry-exit balance" measure so that they can smoothly go to Hong Kong to meet their relatives or handle urgent matters.

    Hong Kong and Macau shipping industry insiders say that the passenger transport on the Hong Kong-Macau route has been affected due to the Hong Kong British authorities' restrictions on mainland travelers entering Hong Kong.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, September 7th: Hong Kong News: Since the Hong Kong British authorities began implementing the so-called "entry-exit balance" passenger entry restrictions on September 3rd, many Hong Kong residents have been crowding the Kowloon Tsim Sha Tsui and railway stations every day, waiting for their relatives and friends to enter Hong Kong. However, most of them had to leave the station with disappointment after waiting until the last train from Lo Wu arrived.

    In order to wait for relatives and friends who were blocked outside the border by the Hong Kong British authorities, some people have been waiting here for several days. They all expressed dissatisfaction with this unreasonable restriction by the Hong Kong British authorities. An elderly woman surnamed Lan went to the railway station to pick up her sister from Xinhui Township, Guangdong, but had not received her for three consecutive days. She said angrily: "My sister and I are both ninety years old, and there are not many days left for the old sisters to meet. Is it necessary to restrict everyone from meeting at this time!" A businessman surnamed Chen had been waiting here for several days but had not seen his wife and three children who arrived in Shenzhen on September 3rd. He believes that this restriction that prevents his wife and children from reuniting is too inhuman and has no reason at all. A shop employee surnamed Lin said: "I have already taken four days off to pick up my mother, and I still don't know when I will be able to see her. This unreasonable restriction has caused great losses to my spirit, time and money."

    滞留澳门旅客要求撤销“出入平衡”办法
    许多香港居民不满英国当局的无理措施
    新华社广州7日电　香港消息：从香港英国当局再次执行所谓“出入平衡”办法以来，已有近百个经过澳门前往香港的内地旅客焦灼不安地滞留在澳门。
    有一个名叫范春克的老妇人从石岐经澳门，准备到香港探望小孙女。但是由于香港英国当局在3日实施了“出入平衡”的无理规定，澳门轮船公司不卖船票给她。
    范春克身边带的旅费已经用光了，澳门又举目无亲，她急得在码头外放声大哭。有一位来自恩平的名叫梁远廉的旅客在澳门对人诉说，在国外的亲戚汇给他一笔美金，要他到香港亲自领取。碰着这个入境限制，他不但收不到汇款，几乎连旅费也没有着落。还有一个想到香港去领取丈夫的人寿保险金的妇女郭桂英也被滞留在澳门。她十分焦急，担心过了时间这笔钱就会落空。被滞留在澳门的内地旅客都希望香港英国当局撤销“出入平衡”办法，让他们能够顺利地到香港去会见亲人或者办理急要的事务。
    香港和澳门的航业界人士说，由于香港英国当局限制内地旅客入境，港澳线的客运航务已经受到影响。
    新华社广州7日电　香港消息：香港英国当局从9月3日开始实行所谓“出入平衡”的旅客入境限制以来，九龙尖沙和火车站每天都拥挤着许多正在等待着亲友入境的香港居民。但是其中绝大部分人等候到最后一班从罗湖开来的火车抵站后，又不得不带着失望的心情离开车站。
    为了等候被香港英国当局阻挡在境外的亲友，有些人已经在这里苦候了好几天，他们对香港英国当局的这种无理限制都表示不满。一位姓蓝的老太太到火车站去接她从广东新会乡下来的妹妹，但是一连三天没有接到，她愤慨地说：“我和我妹妹都是九十岁的人了，老姊妹见面的时日已经不多，难道这个时候大家见一面也要受限制！”一位姓陈的商人在这里等了几天也没有见到在9月3日就到了深圳的他的妻子和三个儿女。他认为这种使他夫妻儿女不能相聚的限制太不近人情，也没有一点道理。一个姓林的商店职员说：“为了来接我母亲，我已经请了四天假，现在还不晓得要什么时候才能见到她。这种无理限制使我的精神、时间和金钱都受到很大损失。”
