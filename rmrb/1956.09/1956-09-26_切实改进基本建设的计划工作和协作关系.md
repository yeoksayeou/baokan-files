Speech by Comrade Tang Dihua, Director of the Design Division of the Ministry of Chemical Industry
It is hoped that the various leading organs will conduct thorough investigations and research before compiling and revising plans, and establish some necessary systems; it is hoped that the State Planning Commission will effectively arrange the collaborative tasks of relevant departments when determining each basic construction project, and promptly organize consultations and make decisions when disputes occur; it is hoped that all departments will earnestly guarantee the completion of such collaborative tasks.

Under the correct leadership of the Party, China's basic construction cause has achieved significant accomplishments; however, we still have many shortcomings in our actual work. I would now like to offer some opinions on the planning work and collaboration issues of basic construction from the perspective of the Chemical Industry Design Institute, hoping that the Party will strengthen its specific leadership over basic construction work.

Since its establishment in 1953, the Chemical Industry Design Institute has done some work for the country's construction cause, but it has also taken many detours. In the past few years, in addition to cooperating with foreign designs, we have independently designed a total of 68 industrial projects of various sizes, of which more than 60 percent were cancelled or reworked due to plan changes. Some preliminary designs had been completed, and some even had technical designs completed before being cancelled. The consequences, without even mentioning the impact on the construction units and construction projects, solely for the design institute, according to incomplete statistics from 1954 and 1955, a total of 85,000 workdays of surveying and design manpower were wasted, equivalent to 280 people not working for a year, equivalent to about 14 percent of the total surveying and design manpower of the entire institute being wasted each year. This has caused some surveying and design personnel to not see the results of their labor for a long time, which has reduced their confidence in their work. At present, our country's technical strength is extremely lacking, and it is far from meeting the needs of work development. This situation cannot be said to be serious.

Of course, there are many objective difficulties in planning work, and it is impossible to require that specific plans remain completely unchanged. However, it should also be admitted that we are not cautious enough in the formulation and modification of the state's basic construction plan. We often decide on plans without the necessary basis, having projects and schedules but uncertain product plans, factory locations, and regions, making it impossible to start the design work. For plans that have been affirmed, we often easily change tasks and factory locations. The Sichuan Fertilizer Plant moving its factory site four times in three years and the Changshou Chemical Plant changing its tasks five times in more than a year are typical examples. For example, the Nanjing Phosphate Fertilizer Plant, due to the high tide of agricultural cooperativization, the leadership requested early construction. Thus, without regard for procedures and equipment data and other conditions, the design was rushed out. Later, due to problems with materials and equipment, it failed to be constructed as scheduled. By mid-August, only 17.8 percent of the original basic construction plan had been completed. The paint spraying workshop of the Dalian Paint Factory was an important task proposed by the outside, and the design and construction were completed, but this year's production task is less than a quarter of the designed capacity. Couldn't this have been considered more carefully beforehand and done more steadily? In the design of the Shanxi Phosphate Fertilizer Plant, the design institute obtained the director's agreement and added a precipitated calcium phosphate workshop. However, when the Planning Division formally assigned the task, the Technology Division pointed out that this was uneconomical, cancelled the task of the institute's experiment with precipitated calcium phosphate, and the design institute also stopped the design. This shows that we lack necessary systems for changing tasks, lack collective research and mutual contact, and have phenomena of simply and one-sidedly deciding issues. It often happens that the leadership discovers a new situation, or experts put forward a suggestion, and as long as there is no large-scale construction, the original plan is easily overturned. From the State Planning Commission and the State Construction Commission to the various relevant ministries, down to the divisions, bureaus, and design institute directors, anyone can put forward opinions at any time and insist on changing the original plan. In this way, "planning is not as good as change" is, of course, unavoidable. We often unconsciously compromise to the established situation and are overly critical of new undertakings. This trend will prevent new things from growing. A large basic construction project often takes two or three years from the decision of the plan to the completion of the design and the commencement of large-scale construction. During this period, situations will always develop, and understandings will always change. If the plan is always changing with it, without relative stability, then basic construction cannot proceed.

Secondly, in the process of implementing the plan, there are many contradictions in the cooperation and coordination of various departments, and often no one is responsible for resolving them in a timely manner. For example, the Sichuan Fertilizer Plant has encountered many obstacles and taken many detours in determining the factory site and industrial zone planning over the years. The person in charge of the design expressed his complaints, saying that he had spent almost all his energy running around for the factory site and external conditions in the past three years, learning "how to run around to various agencies and communicate through official documents." He said that "those who are responsible for completing the task have no right to solve the problem, and the agencies that have the right to solve the problem are not responsible. How can things be done well?" In fact, this is not only his personal opinion, but many design leaders have the same feeling. Not long ago, the design department of the Ministry of Power Industry wanted to overturn the Jintang factory site, which was the fourth site of the fertilizer plant, for some reason, and the urban design institute also had reasons to want to greatly change the already determined industrial zone planning of Jintang. This time, because the State Construction Commission insisted that the factory site remain unchanged and that changes in urban planning should not affect the construction of the Sichuan Fertilizer Plant, the problem was quickly resolved. It can be seen that the problems that were delayed for so long before were not all impossible to solve. The construction of a large-scale factory must have the cooperation and coordination of all aspects and departments. In a planned economy, this mutual influence and mutual restraint are even more significant. If they hold each other back, the consequences will be far more than wasting some design power and postponing the construction of a certain project!

The situation is much better for projects entrusted to foreign designs. In the chemical industry, the seven old foreign designs have not moved their factory sites in the past few years; the variety and quantity of a few products have changed somewhat, but they have all been carefully considered; and the cooperation of all aspects has been relatively good. There is no other reason for this, only because these are major projects designed by foreign countries, and leaders at all levels attach importance to them, take a serious attitude towards the established plans, and earnestly solve problems.

To change this abnormal situation, in addition to the relevant state leading organs grasping long-term plans and regional planning to solve fundamental problems, it is also necessary to effectively improve the planning work and collaborative relationships of basic construction.

First, it is required that the various leading organs conduct thorough investigations and research before compiling and revising plans in order to obtain a certain reliable basis. They should not decide on issues rashly based solely on needs and wishes. They should consider various factors for completing the plan, such as resources, equipment, technical conditions, human and financial resources, and cooperation conditions, and give appropriate guarantees. In particular, when the situation changes, requiring new demands or when the outside puts forward urgent and important tasks, more careful and calm consideration should be given from all aspects. At the same time, some necessary systems should be established to overcome the existing chaotic phenomenon.

Second, it is required that the State Planning Commission effectively arrange the collaborative tasks of relevant departments when determining each basic construction project. Each department should also regard this collaborative task as its own responsibility and earnestly guarantee it. It is required that the State Construction Commission not only promptly organize consultations for disputes that occur between departments during the design process, but also earnestly clarify the situation and make decisions to ensure the on-schedule completion of the basic construction plan.

It should be pointed out that our design institute itself has many serious shortcomings. Although the working comrades are very enthusiastic, due to the low ideological level of the leadership, weak organizational ability, improper internal planning arrangements, unreasonable labor organization, poor technical management, and failure to fully utilize the role of technical backbones; as a result, the design level has not improved quickly, the quality of design products is not high, and there are phenomena of formalism and waste, etc. In the future, we must redouble our efforts to resolutely overcome these shortcomings under the correct leadership of the Party.

### 切实改进基本建设的计划工作和协作关系

    切实改进基本建设的计划工作和协作关系
    化学工业部设计司司长　唐棣华同志的发言
    希望各领导机关在编制和修订计划之先进行充分的调查研究，并建立一些必要的制度；希望计委在确定每一个基本建设项目时，把有关各部门的协作任务切实安排好，在发生争执时及时组织协商，作出决定；希望各部门认真保证这种协作任务的完成。
    在党的正确领导下，我国的基本建设事业已经获得了重大的成就；但是，我们在实际工作中的缺点还是很多的。我现在仅从化工设计院的角度对基本建设的计划工作和协作问题提出一点意见，希望党加强对基本建设工作的具体领导。
    化工设计院自一九五三年成立以来，为国家建设事业做了一些工作，但也走了不少冤枉路。几年来，我们除配合国外设计以外，自己设计的工业项目大小共六十八项，其中因计划变更取消和返工的项目就占总数百分之六十以上。有的初步设计已经做完有的甚至技术设计都已做完又取消了。其后果，且不谈对于施工单位和建设工程的影响，单就设计院来说，根据一九五四、一九五五两年不完全统计，共浪费勘测设计力量八万五千个工作日，相当于二百八十人一年没有做工作，相当于每年浪费全院勘测设计力量总数的百分之十四左右。使一部分勘测设计人员长期看不见自己劳动的结果，以致降低了工作的信心。目前，我国的技术力量极其缺乏，远远不能适应工作发展的需要，这种情况不能不说是严重的。
    当然，计划工作在客观上是有很多困难，要求具体计划完全不变是不可能的。但是也应当承认，我们对国家基本建设计划的编制和修改是不够慎重的。往往没有必要的根据就决定计划，有项目有进度但产品方案厂址区域不定，使设计工作无从着手。而对已经肯定了的计划，又往往轻易的变更任务变更厂址。像四川肥料厂三年来四迁厂址，长寿化工厂一年多五改任务，都是典型的例子。像南京磷肥厂因农业合作化高潮到来，领导要求提前建设，于是不顾程序和设备资料等条件赶出设计，以后又因为材料、设备都有问题，未能如期施工，到八月中旬才完成原订基本建设计划百分之十七点八。像大连油漆厂的喷漆车间是外部提出的重要任务，设计施工都已完毕，而今年的生产任务却不到设计能力的四分之一，难道事先不可以考虑得更周到一点，搞得更稳当一点吗？在山西磷肥厂的设计中，设计院取得局长同意，增加了沉淀磷酸钙车间。但是，当计划司正式布置任务的时候，技术司却指出这样做不经济，取消了研究所试验沉淀磷酸钙的任务，设计院也因而停止了设计，这说明我们变更任务缺乏必要的制度，缺乏集体研究和相互联系，有简单片面决定问题的现象。常有这样的事情，领导上发现了一个新情况，或者专家提出了一个建议，只要没有大规模施工，就轻易推翻原来的计划；上自国家计划委员会和国家建设委员会，各个有关部，下至司、局、设计院长，都可以随时提出意见并坚持改变原定计划。如此，“计划不如变化”当然就不可避免了。我们常常不自觉的对已成的局面委曲迁就，对新建的事业求全责备，这种风气是会使新事物成长不起来的。一个较大的基本建设工程，从决定计划到设计完毕进入大规模施工，往往需要两三年的时间。在这期间，情况总会有发展，认识总会有变化，如果计划也总是跟着变，没有相对的稳定性，那么，基本建设就无法进行了。
    其次，执行计划的过程中，各部门在协作配合上矛盾很多，常常无人负责及时解决。例如，四川肥料厂，几年来在确定厂址和工业区规划的过程中，不知碰了多少钉子，走了多少弯路。设计总负责人牢骚满腹，说是三年来几乎全部精力都用来跑厂址、跑外部条件了；学到的是“如何奔走各机关，上下行文打交道”。说是“有责任完成任务的人无权解决问题，有权解决问题的机关又无人负责，事情如何办得好”。其实这不仅是他个人的意见，许多设计负责人都有同感。不久以前，电力工业部设计部门又因某种理由要推翻肥料厂四迁后的金堂厂址，城市设计院也有理由想大改金堂已定的工业区规划；这一次由于国家建设委员会坚持厂址不变，城市规划变更不得影响四川肥料厂建设，问题就迅速解决了。可见以前那些拖延不决的问题，并不都是无法解决的。建设一个大规模的工厂，必须有各方面各部门的配合协作。在计划经济中这种相互影响、相互制约更为显著。如果彼此扯腿，则其后果决不止于浪费一部分设计力量，推迟某一项工程的建设而已！
    委托国外设计的项目情况就好得多，化工方面老的七项国外设计，几年来厂址未动；少数产品的品种数量有些变动也都经过比较慎重的考虑；各方面的配合也都比较好。这没有别的缘故，只因为是国外设计的重大项目，各级领导重视，对已定的计划态度严肃，认真解决问题罢了。
    要改变这种不正常的情况，除了国家有关的领导机关抓紧长远计划和区域规划，解决根本问题外，还需要切实改进基本建设的计划工作和协作配合关系。
    第一、要求各领导机关在编制和修订计划之先要有充分的调查研究，以取得一定可靠的依据，不可单从需要和愿望出发，草率的决定问题，要考虑完成计划的各种因素，如资源设备技术条件、人力财力协作条件等，并给以适当的保证；特别当形势变化，需要提出新的要求或当外部提出紧急重要任务时，更应该从各方面作慎重冷静的考虑。同时还要建立一些必要的制度，克服现存的混乱现象。
    第二、要求国家计划委员会在确定每一个基本建设项目时，同时把有关各部门的协作任务切实安排好。各部门也要把这种协作任务当作自己的责任，而认真地予以保证。要求国家建设委员会在设计进行的过程中，对于各部门发生的争执不仅要及时组织协商，而且要切实弄清情况作出决定，以保证基本建设计划的按期完成。
    应该指出，我们设计院本身存在着许多严重缺点。虽然工作同志们积极性很高，但由于领导思想水平低，组织能力弱，内部计划安排不尽妥当，劳动组织不够合理，技术管理不好，技术骨干未能充分发挥作用；以致设计水平提高不快，设计成品质量不高，有形式主义和浪费现象等等。今后我们一定要加倍努力在党的正确领导下，坚决地克服这些缺点。
