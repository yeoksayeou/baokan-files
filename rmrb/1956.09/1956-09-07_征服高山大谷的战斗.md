    The Battle to Conquer High Mountains and Great Valleys
    Li Naiyin
    After passing Yong'an County, the jeep sped southeast at forty kilometers per hour. The southern hot wind rushed towards us, and the wooden houses in the villages along the road quickly moved behind us. We were driving alongside the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway line, and the already built roadbed was hidden behind a patch of green crops. But after a short distance, the old road came to its end, and the jeep suddenly jumped onto a newly opened, rugged mountain road. Ahead was a mountain range with towering peaks and deep, dangerous valleys. The speedometer's needle quickly trembled and dropped, twenty kilometers, ten kilometers, seven kilometers..., the engine roared, panting as it climbed ridge after ridge, drilling into the mountains and forests. On both sides of the newly opened road, there were warning signs everywhere: "Attention, Dangerous Road, Drive Slowly!" "Sharp Turn, Honk Horn!"
    A burst of whistle blasts and the rumble of engines came, and the road suddenly became crowded. Large convoys of transport trucks passed shoulder to shoulder, loaded with steel bars, cement, wood, and fine sand needed for the railway construction site. The drivers raised their right hands to greet us, raising a cloud of dust as they drove forward.
    The adjacent roadbed suddenly disappeared behind a patch of mountains and ridges. When we saw it again, it had risen to the mountainside, and people could only look up at its yellow edge. From that mid-air, came the roaring sound of blowers and the "tat-tat" sound of pneumatic drills. A cloud of smoke rose from behind the mountain, and the rolling thunder of the large explosion echoed in the deep mountains, and the ground under people's feet was shaking.
    We had reached the famous key construction area of the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway line -- the Minnan (Southern Fujian) and Minbei (Northern Fujian) watershed construction area. The famous Daiyun Mountain range in Fujian extended its vast and dangerous waist here, blocking the railway's southward path. The peaks of Qitou Mountain, Mahuagan Mountain, and Daliang Mountain, which are 1,076 to 1,241 meters above sea level, overlooked this line and laid down deep valleys, large ridges, and streams in front of it. The heroic railway soldiers were launching a powerful offensive in this deep mountain and valley area. The soldiers' slogan was: Fill the valleys, split open the cliffs, and complete the railway to Xiamen ahead of schedule!
    Before arriving at this construction area, we had met with Colonel Liu Ke, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Railway Corps. In his office, which was covered with route maps and construction plans, Colonel Liu Ke introduced us to the general situation of this arduous project. Thus, a battle scene of our army and people conquering high mountains and great valleys with extraordinary perseverance and outstanding labor unfolded before us. A black line extended southeast from Yingtan Station on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi line in Jiangxi Province. The line crossed the hills around Zixi and entered the famous Wuyi Mountain area, the watershed between Fujian and Jiangxi. This was the first key construction area on the Yingxia line. The construction troops dug through Dahe Mountain and Xiaohe Mountain, allowing the line to break through the Wuyi Mountain watershed and enter Fujian Province. It is entirely appropriate to describe the mountainous area of northern Fujian as "no three feet of level ground." The line spiraled and extended through thousands of mountains, penetrating many ridges, crossing countless streams and rivers, passing Yong'an County, and entering the Daiyun Mountains.
      The construction troops encountered enormous difficulties in this mountainous area. Within the 49-kilometer line from Zhusheyang to Chengkou, there were 13 tunnels, 12 bridges, and a large number of high-filling and deep-cut projects. Particularly difficult was the 8.8-kilometer section from Chitouban to Kezhoukeng. Tunnels, bridges, large cuts, and large fills followed one after another, and the line spiraled high on the mountainside. The average total earth and stone volume per kilometer was as high as 170,000 cubic meters. If it were arranged into a levee one meter high and one meter wide, it would be 170 kilometers long.
    Colonel Liu Ke said: "This is the second key project on the Yingxia line. Now the eyes of the entire line are focused here, and the entire army is transferring all possible manpower and material resources to support the construction here. Thousands of military and civilian laborers are working here day and night in shifts. Whether the entire line can be opened to traffic ahead of schedule depends on whether the construction task here can be completed according to plan!"
    Now, we have arrived at this famous construction area. A winding mountain road spiraled through the mountains, guiding us to Kezhoukeng. The jeep stopped on a high mountain ridge. Looking around, we could only see deep valleys, and many low ridges were under our feet. The assistant of a certain regiment who accompanied us to the construction site told us: "We're here, this is the Kezhoukeng Dala Gou (Big Gully)!"
    In the center of the mountain ridge in front of us, a huge gully appeared, more than a mile long. The leveled gully walls exposed blue and yellow rocks. At the bottom of the deep gully, several tracks extended out of the gully, and iron hopper cars full of earth and stone were speeding by with a rumble. From the gully, came bursts of clanging sound of chiseling stone and labor chants. Railway soldiers in military uniforms and civilian laborers wearing straw hats were working hard to remove the last stone cliff in the gully.
    Climbing up the 50-meter-high gully cliff and looking down, we could only see that the gully walls were as steep as if they had been cut with a knife. Even though we held tightly to the wooden stakes along the gully edge, we still felt a little dizzy. At this time, the brave slope brushers were hanging on ropes, stepping on the cliff walls, clearing away loose stones that might collapse.
    The large slogan on the gully wall expressed the heroic aspirations and heroic volunteers of the builders of this great project: "Dedicate all strength to the motherland, build a road of happiness for the people!"
    Walking out of the Dala Gou and turning a small bend, we entered the Xiaola Gou (Small Gully). Although it is called Xiaola Gou, the project here is not small, just because it is slightly shorter than the Dala Gou.
    Even before we were far from the mouth of the gully, we heard the dense "tat-tat" sound of pneumatic drills inside the gully. The mountains around this gully were like they had been swept by thunder, many large trees were uprooted, and the mountain slopes covered with gray stone powder and yellow dust were strewn with branches of tall fir trees that had been cut and split. Occasionally, a surviving tree stood naked on the bare hillside, with all its branches cut off.
    Lieutenant Dan Shide, political instructor of the Fifth Company, which was responsible for the construction task of Xiaola Gou, told me: This is the "achievement" of large-scale blasting! He said: "In the construction of Xiaola Gou, we adopted the advanced experience of Soviet large-scale blasting, using explosives to replace manual labor. This allowed projects that would have taken many people many days to complete in one blast, greatly speeding up the progress of the project. In this work, we have cultivated and trained a large number of excellent pneumatic drill operators and blasters, who have become famous figures on the construction site. Even the civilian laborers who worked with us have learned this technique." He pointed to a soldier who was holding a pneumatic drill and attacking the rock and said: "His name is Jiang Shuangyuan, and he is not our top pneumatic drill operator, but his work efficiency far exceeds the quota."
    Lieutenant Dan Shide told us about a recent large-scale blasting operation. They drilled six well holes, each 1.2 square meters in size and 14 to 18 meters deep, into this hard stone mountain made of granite, and filled them with 49 tons of explosives. After everyone moved away from the construction site, the medicine chamber was lit. Immediately, like a volcanic eruption, a deep thunder rolled across the mountain ridge, and the earth also trembled. In the smoke, a huge deep gully split open in the mountain ridge. This blasting completely lifted away 15,000 cubic meters of mountain rock, completing a quarter of the total project stone. Dan Shide said with a smile: "That was simply a landslide! Huge stones flew across the sky, and the forest on the hillside was flattened at once! Now, our blasters can not only blast away rocks, but also direct the direction in which the stones fly out, so that the blasted stones fly exactly to the gullies and pits that need to be filled, greatly increasing the efficiency of large-scale blasting. ..."
    Our conversation was not over when the whistle sounded. A soldier waved a red flag and ordered people to leave. Dan Shide pulled us and said: "Let's go, they're blasting! Let's go to the command post to hide." The so-called command post was just a shed built with multiple layers of horizontal wood behind the mountain. It was filled with dynamite boxes, detonators, and various tools. We had just sat down when the pneumatic drill operators rushed over, wiping sweat from their faces. They put down their pneumatic drills and hurried out again. When they ran back again, they were followed by a string of artillery fire. Gray mist rose in the mountain gully, and flying stones whistled overhead like a rain of bullets, hitting the roof of the shed with a "ping-pong" sound.
    We calculated that this blasting fired more than 100 shots in total, lasting more than ten minutes. A large stone cliff that had originally blocked the center of the gully had changed its appearance after the artillery fire.
    A tall, strong, and slightly dark-faced soldier walked into the work shed. "Chen Xianrong, the deputy squad leader of the Youth Assault Squad." Dan Shide introduced to us: "This is one of the two best pneumatic drill operators in our entire company. These two pneumatic drill operators are both from Guangdong." Chen Xianrong sat down and talked to us in Mandarin mixed with many Guangdong dialects: "In the well-drilling work of that large-scale blasting, we were swinging eight-pound hammers and steel chisels. In one day, we could only drill 0.9 meters. How could that work? At this speed, the project would be delayed for many days. So our group discussed how to improve the operation and speed up the work, and finally found the trick, and in a few days, we increased the daily work efficiency to 3.85 meters. Now we are using pneumatic drills to make holes, and I have drilled 300 meters without breaking a hollow tube once. Our pneumatic drill operators are launching a labor competition for 500 meters without accidents." Dan Shide interrupted at this time and said: "Chen Xianrong's current achievement is 15.2 meters, exceeding the technical quota by 6 meters and one and a half times."
    When we talked about the track-laying team advancing here and whether the mountains blocking the way could be leveled, Chen Xianrong said firmly: "Don't worry, we will never block the train from passing here! Although the task is arduous, we are fully confident of completing it on schedule."
    When we inspected the construction sites north and south of the watershed, we heard the heroic words of the soldiers and civilian laborers more than once: "We will never block the train from passing here!" When the track-laying team led the train here with an inspiring speed, this slogan was so loud and powerful. Whether it was the commanders of regiments and companies, or the squad and platoon soldiers who were responsible for a specific task, they would tell you that their section of the project was guaranteed to be completed ahead of schedule. Completing the Yingxia Railway ahead of schedule was no longer a general slogan, but was being realized by the specific actions of countless soldiers and civilian laborers. A soldier said it well: "Think about it, the track-laying team has arrived, the other people's sections have been completed, but only your section of the project has not been completed, the track-laying team is stopped here, the train is stopped here, the task of opening the entire line to traffic is delayed because of your small section of the project, and the people of the whole country are anxious for your small section of the project, how can you have the face to see people? This is a disgrace!"
    Yes, it is precisely this kind of consciousness and high sense of responsibility that is driving the soldiers to carry out selfless labor in the Daiyun Mountains, driving the surging labor competition movement on various construction sites. All wisdom, thoughts, and strength are concentrated on completing the railway ahead of schedule, and huge difficulties are being overcome. The veteran soldiers gave up their vacations: "Let's rest after the railway is completed!" The families of the officers also went to the construction site: "Every bit of strength must shine in this great project!" The office cadres also left the office: "Go to the construction site!" On various tunnel, bridge, excavation, and filling construction sites, people braved the hot southern weather to launch a general offensive against the high mountains and ridges.
    Turning over a large ridge covered by primitive forest, we came to the Gongziwan construction site. Large-scale mechanized construction was underway here. Bulldozers, scrapers, graders, and rollers were rumbling and running back and forth on the flat construction site on the mountainside. Only machines were moving on the wide, long construction site, but there was no noisy crowd. A mountain top as high as 46 meters had been leveled by 38 meters; the earth and stone shoveled from the mountain had filled a valley pit dozens of meters deep. Only 70,000 cubic meters of the total project's 610,000 cubic meters of excavation and filling tasks remained. Tractor drivers were launching a heated labor competition to complete the construction faster. The No. 36 scraper was particularly active on the construction site. The driver was driver Li Renfeng. Li Mingtang, the captain of the mechanized company, told us that in the past few days, Li Renfeng increased the number of earth scraped and transported from 83 trips in eight hours to 103 trips, setting a company record. But only one night later, Xu Chuanlin, the driver of another tractor, surpassed him with 113 trips. Now they are competing to break this number. The drivers of the No. 28 and No. 11 bulldozers were also competing. Captain Li Mingtang said with a smile: "In just the past few days, the drivers of seven tractors have won bonuses!"
    Walking through many construction sites, we could see Fujian civilian laborers who were enthusiastically participating in the railway construction project with socialist construction enthusiasm. The soldiers gave a thumbs up and praised: "The Fujian civilian laborers are really good!" On the Yingxia line, wherever there are railway soldiers, there are teams of civilian laborers. Tens of thousands of Fujian civilian laborers were responsible for most of the earth and stone work on the railway construction site. Many people learned the techniques of pneumatic drills, blasting, and stone masonry. They and the soldiers braved the wind, cold, heat, and attacked the barren mountains and hard rocks. Seventy percent of the 182 civilian laborers in Ninghua County learned the technique of loading explosives, and 17 people learned to detonate. They had never seen pneumatic drills before, but now there are 17 skilled pneumatic drill operators. Ma Guirong, who is twenty years old, just started learning to use pneumatic drills. He said to me proudly: "I must learn this technique, and in the future we will build railways in Fujian ourselves!"
    It is particularly touching that large numbers of young Fujian women and girls can be seen participating in the railway construction project on many construction sites. In the majestic labor chants, mixed with high-pitched female voices, they participated in various tasks like male civilian laborers, and were not weaker than men at all. At the No. 1 large cut construction site in Chitouban, we visited the Zhangpu County civilian labor team. There were 27 young female civilian laborers in this team. Their ages ranged from 18 to 24 years old. Cai Benhua and Chen Miao, both 20-year-old young women, were known as the team's bulldozing experts, and their workload exceeded that of many men. When I raised my camera to photograph their heroic labor姿姿, many people on the construction site shouted: "Come on! Learn from Xiao Cai! We also want to be on the newspaper!"…
    We inspected many construction sites and returned to the construction area command post. At this time, it was already dusk, and the construction site was lit up. Huge searchlights illuminated the area, loudspeakers broadcast majestic marches, the rumbling sound of machines, rhythmic labor songs, and the constantly transmitted sound of blasting broke the silence of the night and echoed among the mountains, inspiring people's hearts. There is no nighttime in Daiyun Mountain! When the people in towns and villages across the country were already asleep, hundreds of thousands of people on the steep peaks of Daiyun Mountain were working selflessly for the construction of the motherland. It reminded me of a saying by a commander of the Railway Corps: Some people describe the construction of the Yingxia Railway as a project of "moving mountains and filling seas," which is true. On Xiamen Island, we filled the bay and built roadbeds. In the Daiyun Mountains, we literally split open or moved some mountain ridges. Completing this mountain railway in a short period of time is rare in the history of engineering. Our people are creating miracles!
    A team of heavy-duty trucks, like a string of shooting stars, drove by our window with their headlights on; the telephone in the headquarters next door rang crisply, transmitting the orders for the night battle. There is no night in Daiyun Mountain! When the people in towns and villages across the country were already asleep, hundreds of thousands of people on the steep peaks of Daiyun Mountain were working selflessly for the construction of the motherland. It reminded me of a saying by a commander of the Railway Corps: Some people describe the construction of the Yingxia Railway as a project of "moving mountains and filling seas," which is true. On Xiamen Island, we filled the bay and built roadbeds. In the Daiyun Mountains, we literally split open or moved some mountain ridges. Completing this mountain railway in a short period of time is rare in the history of engineering. Our people are creating miracles!

    征服高山大谷的战斗
    李耐因
    越过永安县城以后，吉普车以每小时四十公里的速度向东南飞驰。南方的热风迎面扑来，路边村落的木板房飞快地向身后移去。我们是傍着鹰潭—厦门铁路线行驶的，已经筑好的路基隐现在一片葱绿的庄稼后面。但是行没多久，旧的道路到了它的尽头，吉普车猛然跳上新辟的崎岖山道。迎面是一片群峰兀立、谷深崖险的大山。计速器的指针迅速地抖动着低垂下来，二十公里、十公里、七公里……，马达吼叫着，喘息着爬上一座座岭崖，钻进山林。新辟的道路两旁，到处是“注意，险路慢行！”“急转弯，鸣笛！”的警告牌。
    一阵汽笛的喧叫和马达的隆隆声传来，道路突然拥挤起来。大队大队的运输卡车擦肩而过，车上载满了筑路工地上所需用的钢筋、水泥、木材和细沙。司机们举起右手向我们打个招呼，扬起一片尘雾向前驶去。
    傍行的路基这时突然消失在一片山林和岭岗后面，当我们重新看到它时，它已经升高到半山腰，人们只能仰望到它黄色的边缘。从那半空中，传来鼓风机的隆隆叫声和风枪的达达声。一阵烟尘从山后升起，大爆破的滚雷炮声在深山中回响着，人们脚下的土地也在晃动。
    我们已经达到了鹰潭—厦门铁路线上著名的重点工区——闽南、闽北分水岭筑路工区。福建境内有名的戴云山脉，把它庞大险峻的腰身伸展到这里，挡住了铁路南通的道路。海拔一千零七十六至一千二百四十一公尺高的旗头山、马花干山、大晾山的群峰，俯瞰着这条线路，并在它面前布下一道道深谷、大岭和溪流。英雄的铁道兵的战士们，就在这一片深山大谷中展开了强大的攻势。战士们的口号是：填平山谷，劈开山崖，提前把铁路修通到厦门！
    还在到达这一工区之前，我们曾会见了铁道兵技术副司令刘克大校。刘克大校在他挂满线路图、施工计划图的办公室内，向我们介绍了这段艰巨工程的概况。于是，一幅我国军队和人民以超绝的毅力和卓越的劳动征服高山大谷的战斗图景，在我们面前展开。一条墨线以江西境内浙赣线上的鹰潭车站为起点，向东南伸延。线路越过资溪一带丘岭，进入了著名的闽赣分水岭武夷山区。这是鹰厦线上第一个重点工程区。筑路部队挖通了大、小禾山，使线路突破武夷山分水岭进入福建境内。用“地无三尺平”来形容闽北山区，是完全恰当的。线路在万山丛中盘旋伸延，穿透许多山岭，跨过无数溪流河道，越过永安县城，进入戴云山中。
      筑路部队在这一片山地内，遭遇到了巨大的
  困难。自猪舌洋到城口的四十九公里线路内，集中有隧道十三座，桥梁十二座和大量的高填深挖工程。特别艰巨的是自赤头板到柯周坑的八点八公里地段，隧道、桥梁、大劈方、大填方一个接一个，线路高高地在半山腰中盘转。平均每公里土石方总量高达十七万方以上，如果把它排成一公尺高一公尺宽的堤坝，就有一百七十公里长。
    刘克大校说：“这是鹰厦线上第二个关键工程。现在全线的眼睛都注视着这里，全军都抽调可能的人力、物力支援这里的施工，成千上万的军工和民工正在这里日夜轮班动工。全线能否提前通车，就看这里能不能按计划完成施工任务！”
    现在，我们已经到达了这一著名工区。一条蜿蜒的山路在山间盘转着，引导我们到柯周坑去。吉普车停在一座高大的山岭上面，四面望去只见一道道深谷，许多低岭都在脚下。陪同我们到工地去的某团助理员告诉我们：“到了，这里就是柯周坑大拉沟！”
    在我们面前的山岭中心，出现了一道巨大的足有一里多路长的深沟。被削平的沟壁，裸露着青色和黄色的岩石。在深深的沟底，好几道轨道向沟外伸出去，一辆辆载满土石的铁斗车，正隆隆的飞驶着。沟里传出一阵阵叮叮当当的凿石声和劳动号子声，穿着军装的铁道兵战士和戴着斗笠的民工们，正在为铲除沟内最后一道石崖而紧张劳动着。
    攀登上高达五十公尺的沟崖，向下望去，只见沟壁像刀切一样陡直，尽管我们紧抓住沟沿的木桩，仍然觉得有些眩晕。而这时，勇敢的刷坡工们却垂吊在绳索上，脚蹬着崖壁，清除可能坍下的松石。
    沟壁上斗大的标语字，道出了这一伟大工程的修建者的豪壮胸怀和英雄志愿“为祖国贡献一切力量，给人民修通幸福之路！”
    走出大拉沟拐一个小弯就进入了小拉沟。虽然是叫小拉沟，可是这里的工程却不小，仅仅因为它比大拉沟稍短些而已。
    还离着沟口很远，就听到了沟内风枪的密集的达达声。这座沟周围的山岭上，像曾被暴雷扫过的一样，许多大树连根拔起，盖满灰色石粉和黄尘的山坡上，横陈着被斩断劈裂的高大杉树的枝枝杈杈。偶尔有一棵幸存的大树，枝杈都被斩光，赤裸裸地竖立在光秃的山坡上。
    担任小拉沟施工任务的第五连指导员单世德中尉告诉我：这是大爆破的“成绩”！他说：“在小拉沟的施工中，我们采用了苏联大爆破的先进经验，让炸药代替人工作。这使要许多人工作很多天的工程，在一声炮响中就完成了，大大加快了工程进展速度。在这一工作中，我们培养锻练出大批优秀的风枪手、爆破手，他们成了工地上有名的人物。连和我们一块工作的民工，也学会了这一技术。”他指着一个正抱着风枪向岩石进攻的战士说：“他的名字叫蒋双圆，并不是我们顶出色的风枪手，但是他的工效也远远超过了定额。”
    单世德中尉向我们讲述了不久前进行的一次大爆破的情形。他们在这座花岗岩构成的硬石山上，凿挖了一点二平方公尺大、十四至十八公尺深的六个井洞，里面填装了四十九吨炸药。在所有的人远离工地后，点燃了药室。立刻像火山爆发一样，一阵沉雷滚过山岗，大地也抖动起来，在烟雾中山岭裂开了一个巨大的深沟。这次爆破整整掀走了一万五千立方山石，完成了全部工程石方的四分之一。单世德笑着说：“那简直是山崩地裂！斗大的石头满天横飞，山坡的森林被一下削平！现在，我们的爆破手们不只能炸飞岩石，而且能指挥石头飞出的方向。使炸出的石头，正好飞到须要填平的沟坑，大大增加了大爆破的工效。……”
    我们的谈话还没有结束，哨子声便传来。一个战士挥动着红旗命令人们离开。单世德拉着我们说：“走吧，放炮了！到指挥所去躲一躲。”所谓指挥所，只不过是在山背后用多层横木搭起的棚子。里面堆满了炸药箱、雷管和各种工具。我们刚刚坐下，风枪手们便擦着满脸汗水赶来，他们把风枪放下，又匆忙地跑出去。当他们再次跑回来时，跟在他们身后的是一阵连珠炮声。山沟里升起灰色的雾，飞石像弹雨一样啸叫着从上空飞过，棚子的顶上被打得乒乒乓乓响。
    我们计算着，这一次爆破一共响了一百多炮，持续了十多分钟。原先横挡在沟中央的一个大石崖，在炮声过后已经改变了面貌。
    一个高大、健壮、面庞微黑的战士走进工棚来。“青年突击班下士副班长陈先荣。”单世德给我们介绍说：“这是我们全连最优秀的两个风枪手中的一个。这两个风枪手都是广东人。”陈先荣坐下来，操着夹杂着许多广东土音的普通话和我们谈起来：“在那次大爆破的凿井工作中，我们是抡着八磅锤和钢钎干的。干一天，只能打进零点九公尺。这怎么行呢？靠这样的速度，工程要耽搁许多天。于是我们小组就讨论怎样改进操作、加快速度，终于找出了窍门，几天的工夫就把每天的工作效率提高到三点八五公尺。现在我们是用风枪打眼，我已经打了三百公尺没有断过一次空心管。我们风枪手们正展开五百公尺无事故的劳动竞赛。”单世德这时插进来说：“陈先荣现在的成绩是十五点二公尺，超过技术定额六公尺一倍半。
    当我们谈到铺轨队正在向这里推进，拦路的山是否能开平的时候，陈先荣坚定地说：“放心吧，在我们这里绝不会挡住火车通行！虽然任务艰巨，我们完全有把握按期完成。”
    在我们巡视分水岭南北工地的时候，我们不只一次地听到战士们和民工们的豪语：“在我们这里绝不会挡住火车通行！”当铺轨队以令人振奋地速度引导着火车向这里开来的时候，这个口号是那么响亮、有力。不论是团、连的指挥员，还是负担某项具体任务的班排战士，他们都会告诉你，他们的工段保证能提前完成。提前修通鹰厦铁路已经不是笼统的口号，它正在为无数战士和民工的具体行动所实现着。一个战士说得好：“你想想看，铺轨队赶来了，别人的工段已经完成了，而唯独你这段工程没有完，铺轨队停在这里，火车停在这里，全线通车的任务为你搁耽着，全国人民都为你这小段工程着急，你怎么有脸见人啊？这是耻辱！”
    是的，正是这样一种自觉和高度的责任心，推动着战士们在戴云山重重大岭中展开忘我的劳动，推动着各工地上汹涌澎湃的劳动竞赛运动。一切智慧、心思、力量都集中在提前修通铁路上，巨大的困难被克服着。老战士们把休假放弃了：“修通铁路再休息吧！”军官们的家属也上了工地：“每一份力量都要在这伟大工程中放放光！”机关干部也离开了办公室：“到工地去！”在各个隧道、桥梁和挖、填方工地上，人们冒着南方酷热的天气向高山大岭展开总攻。
    翻过一座为原始森林覆盖着的大岭，我们走到宫子湾工地。这里正在进行大规模的机械化施工。隆隆鸣叫着的推土机、铲运机、平路机、压路机，正往返奔驰在半山腰平坦的工地上。宽阔、漫长的工地只有机器在移动，却看不到喧闹的人群。高达四十六公尺的一座山头，已经被削平了三十八公尺；从山上铲下来的土石已经把几十公尺深的谷坑填平。全部工程六十一万方的挖填任务，只剩下了七万方的尾巴。拖拉机司机们正在为更快地完成施工而展开热烈的劳动竞赛。在工地上特别活跃的是三十六号铲运机。驾驶它的是司机长李仁凤。机械连连长李明堂上尉告诉我们，在最近几天内李仁凤铲运土由八小时八十三趟提高到一百零三趟，创造了全连纪录。但是只隔了一夜，另一台拖拉机的司机徐川林就以一百一十三趟超过了他。现在他们间正在为突破这一数字竞赛。二十八号和十一号推土机的司机们，也在进行竞赛。李明堂上尉笑着说：“单只最近一些日子里，就已经有七台拖拉机的司机获得了奖金！”
    走过许多工地，都可以看到满怀着社会主义建设热情紧张参加筑路工程的福建民工。战士们竖起大拇手指夸赞着：“福建民工真是好样的！”在鹰厦线上，哪里有铁道兵，哪里就有民工的队伍。数以万计的福建民工负担着筑路工地上大部分土石方的工程，许多人并学会了风枪、爆破、砌石的技术，他们和战士们一起冒着风寒暑热向荒山坚石进攻。宁化县一百八十二名民工中百分之七十学会了装填炸药的技术，十七个人学会了放炮。从前他们根本没有见过风枪，现在也已出现了十七个熟练的风枪手。二十岁的马贵荣刚刚开始学习使用风枪，他向我自豪地说：“我一定要把这门技术学会，将来我们要自己来修建福建境内的铁路！”
    特别动人的是，在许多工地上可以看到大批福建青年妇女和姑娘参加筑路工程。在雄壮的劳动号子中，夹杂着高昂的女声，她们像男民工一样参加各项工作，而且完全不比男人弱。在赤头板一号大劈方工地上，我们访问了漳浦县民工队。这个队中有二十七名女青年民工。她们的年龄是十八到二十四岁。二十岁的女青年蔡本华和陈妙，被称为全队推土能手，她们的工作量超过了许多男人。当我举起照像机拍摄她们劳动英姿的时候，工地上许多人都喊着：“加油呀！向小蔡学习啊！我们也上报啊！”………
    我们巡行了许多工地返回了工区指挥所，这时候天色已经傍晚，工地上一片灯火。巨大的探照灯照射着，扩音器放送着雄壮的进行曲，隆隆的机器声、有节奏的劳动歌声和不断传来的炸破声，冲破了黑夜的宁静在群峰间回响着，振奋着人们的心弦。戴云山夜间的战斗开始了！
    一队队载重卡车，像一串串流星一样，开着大灯从我们窗外公路上隆隆驰过；隔壁司令部的电话机铃铃地响着，传送着夜间战斗的号令。戴云山是没有夜间的！当全国城镇、乡村的人民已经安睡的时候，戴云山险峻的峰岭上成千上万的人正在紧张地为建设祖国而忘我劳动着。它使我记起铁道兵一位指挥员说的一句话：有人把鹰厦铁路修建形容为“移山填海”的工程，一点不假。在厦门岛我们把海湾填平筑起路基，在戴云山区硬是把一些山岭劈开或移走。在短促时间内修通这条山区铁路，这在工程史上也是不多见的。我们的人民正在创造奇迹！
