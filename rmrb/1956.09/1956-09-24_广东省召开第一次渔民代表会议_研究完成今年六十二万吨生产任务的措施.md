Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, September 22nd: The first Fishermen Representative Meeting of Guangdong Province was held in Guangzhou from the 14th to the 20th. The meeting reviewed the implementation of various related policies and proposed various measures to complete this year's fishery production task of reaching 620,000 tons.

According to the meeting, more than 60% of fishing households in the province have now joined fishery production cooperatives. With the strong support of the state, fisheries have achieved bumper harvests year after year. The output in 1955 reached 520,000 tons, an increase of more than 50% compared to 1949. The lives of fishermen have also gradually improved and increased. This year's fishery production task is 620,000 tons, an increase of approximately 100,000 tons compared to last year, and the lives of fishermen will be further improved as a result. However, there are also many errors in the work: In the fishery cooperativization movement from last winter to this spring, due to the leadership's lack of investigation and research, and insufficient listening to the opinions of the masses, some areas violated the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit, resulting in the pursuit of quantity, expanding and merging cooperatives without the permission of conditions, thereby harming the interests of the fishermen masses. In terms of developing fishery production, only the development of deep-sea operations was emphasized (this policy is correct), but the leadership of small boat production, which accounts for 66% of the province's fishery labor force, was neglected, resulting in slow growth in small boat production and slower improvement in the lives of shallow-sea fishermen. Some fishery areas unilaterally determined the leadership policy of focusing on the development of agricultural production, which reduced fishery production and fishermen's income in these areas. In terms of prices, the purchase price of fish products is too low, and there are phenomena of price suppression and grade reduction; while the price of fishery supplies has been increasing year by year. These have caused great dissatisfaction among fishermen.

In order to improve future work, the meeting decided that it is currently necessary to stop expanding and merging cooperatives and not transition to advanced cooperatives, in order to concentrate on doing a good job in autumn fishing production and strive to increase the income of 90% of the members. At the same time, the state is also required to strengthen the leadership of shallow-sea fishery production in terms of loans and technical guidance; the key fishery counties of Zhuhai, Nan'ao, and Leidong should determine the leadership policy of focusing on the development of fishery production. The purchase price of fish products should be maintained at the 1955 level, price suppression and grade reduction should be strictly prohibited, and the price of fishery supplies should be appropriately reduced.

    广东省召开第一次渔民代表会议
    研究完成今年六十二万吨生产任务的措施
    新华社广州22日电　广东省第一次渔民代表会议自14日到20日在广州举行。会议检查了有关各项政策的贯彻执行情况，并且提出了为完成今年渔业增产任务达到六十二万吨的各项措施。
    根据会议反映，目前全省已有60％以上的渔户参加了渔业生产合作社，在国家的大力帮助下，渔业连年丰收，1955年的产量达到五十二万吨，比1949年增长了50％以上。渔民的生活也逐渐得到改善和提高。今年的渔业生产任务是六十二万吨，比去年增加约十万吨，渔民的生活将因此而进一步得到改善。但在工作中也存在不少错误：在去冬今春的渔业合作化运动中，由于领导上缺乏调查研究，和听取群众意见不够，有些地区违背了自愿与互利的原则，出现了追求数量、不按条件许可就扩社、并社，因而损害了渔民群众的利益。在发展渔业生产方面，只注重发展深海作业（这一方针是对的），但是却忽视了占全省渔业劳动力66％的小船生产的领导，使得小船的生产增长不快，浅海渔民的生活改善较慢。有些渔业地区片面的确定以发展农业生产为主的领导方针，使得这些地区的渔业生产和渔民收入减少。在价格方面，鱼货的收购价格偏低，而且有压价压级的现象；而渔需品的价格却逐年上涨。这些都引起了渔民很大的不满。
    为了改进今后工作，会议决定目前必须停止扩社、并社，不转入高级社，以便集中精力搞好秋汛生产，争取90％的社员增加收入。同时还要求国家从贷款、技术指导等方面来加强对浅海渔业生产的领导；珠海、南澳、雷东等渔业重点县确定以发展渔业生产为主的领导方针。鱼货的收购价格要保持在1955年的水平，严禁压价压级，同时适当降低渔需品的价格。
