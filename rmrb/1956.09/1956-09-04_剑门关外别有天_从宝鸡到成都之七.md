    Beyond Jianmen Pass Lies Another World
    ——From Baoji to Chengdu, Part 7
  　By Our Correspondent　Ji Xichen
    The Shu Road is No Longer Difficult
    After passing the majestic Jianmen Mountain, where "a single pass stands high amidst ten thousand peaks, startling travelers with the difficulty of the Shu Road," the terrain gradually opens up before one's eyes. Small hills covered with pines and cypresses, layer upon layer, resemble green city walls, stretching all the way to the horizon. Among the mountains, in the exquisite and verdant basins, terraced paddy fields, like millions of shimmering mirrors, are arranged on the hillsides. These typical basin landscapes tell people that the train has begun to enter the heartland of Sichuan.
    For several days, I traveled along towering mountains, crossed the towering Qinling Mountains, passed through sparsely populated earthquake zones, crossed rivers winding a thousand times, and traversed the long and arduous Daba Mountains. Now, as I arrive once again in the fertile "Land of Abundance," a feeling of joy and surprise makes me feel as if I have entered another world. Ah! Rich Sichuan, your grain output accounts for more than one-tenth of the country's total grain output, and the seven hundred kinds of local specialties you harbor are sold well in many places both at home and abroad. However, in the past, despite the rich products and treasures you nurtured, fierce mountains blocked you, and treacherous waters cut you off. Grain could not be transported out, and local specialties could not be sold. In your embrace, grain rotted, medicinal materials were burned as firewood, and mines were abandoned. When people heartbreakingly trampled on the fallen fruit, how much they longed for a railway to connect Sichuan with the outside world!
    Now, the wish has become a reality. The train rushes day and night in your embrace. Even Qinglian Township in Zhangming County, the hometown of the great poet Li Bai, who lamented "The difficulty of the Shu Road is greater than ascending to the blue sky," is now accessible by train. What a gratifying and joyous event! The completed Chengdu-Chongqing and Baoji-Chengdu railways, the Sichuan-Guizhou, Chengdu-Kunming, and Neijiang-Kunming railways under construction, and the extensive network of highways and inland river transportation in the province have fundamentally changed the face of the Shu Road. If Li Bai were to revisit Sichuan today, he would find that the people have changed his poems in couplets:
      The people sit on the mountains and rivers, and the Yellow River will have a day of clarity;
      The railway connects Sichuan and Shaanxi, and the Shu Road will no longer be difficult.
      Visiting Li Bai's Former Residence
    After passing through Zhangming, I visited Li Bai's hometown.
    Crossing the clear Fu River, from afar, one can see a dazzling red wall in a green forest on the opposite bank of the river. Two children pointed to the red wall and told me:
    "Look! That is Li Bai's ancestral hall!"
    Although the poet left his hometown more than 1,230 years ago, almost every man, woman, and child here knows Li Bai's life and name. To commemorate him, the farmers living at the foot of Tianbao Mountain have for generations referred to their villages as "Taibai" and his sister "Yueyuan." Taibai Village and Yueyuan Village, surrounded by bamboo forests and green rice paddies, are like a beautiful garden, located on the plain on the left bank of the Fu River. The poet Li Bai spent his youth in this area of green hills and clear waters.
    The stone wall in front of Li Bai's former residence, "Longxi Courtyard," is engraved with three couplets: "The tombs of siblings remain, do not say that the immortal's traces are empty; The autumn writings can be examined, this place has always been the former residence," "Dahua directly connects to the Qinglian residence, and Tianbao remotely looks at the Fenghua Pavilion," "The former dwelling place of the banished immortal is hidden, as if hearing the sound of reading in the past." Li Yueyuan's tomb is located next to the "Longxi Courtyard." The remains of her Fenghua Pavilion, where she dressed every day, and Li Bai's stone tomb of clothes and hats, are both in Qinglian Town. On the Da Xiao Kuang Mountains, thirty miles west of Zhangming County, is the famous "Li Bai Reading Platform." In this beautiful landscape of "isolated peaks standing tall, like writing brushes," the poet wrote "Visiting Taoist Dai Tianshan Without Meeting," "Returning to the Old Mountain in Winter," and the popular "The Difficulty of the Shu Road." Unfortunately, these fascinating historical sites have all been destroyed beyond recognition. The local people and travelers are looking forward to the government restoring them.
    Speaking of "The Difficulty of the Shu Road," the white-haired old man Lin Shaogui told me a legend about Li Bai riding a bamboo horse: The place where Li Bai studied was high in the mountains and the road was dangerous. The poet personally experienced the hardship of "The Difficulty of the Shu Road," so he made a bamboo horse. Riding the bamboo horse, he traveled dozens of miles every day, fetching water from the Feihua Well in Qinglian Township to grind ink and go to the Da Xiao Kuang Mountains to study.
    Now, in the poet's hometown, iron horses have replaced bamboo horses. Trains shuttle under Tianbao Mountain. The many red and white survey markers and flags erected in the green mountains and plains symbolize a greater prosperity in the future.
          A Sea of Green
    Further south lies the ancient city of Mianyang, located at the confluence of the middle reaches of the Fu River and its tributary, the Anchang River. Here, roads and waterways lead downstream to Santai, Suining, Hejiang, and Chongqing, and upstream to Jiangyou and Guangyuan, entering Shaanxi and Gansu. Since ancient times, it has been an important transportation hub in northern Sichuan. There are still many ancient historical monuments here, such as the nationally rare carved statue "Han Que," the Tang Dynasty stone carvings of the Dafo Temple in Weicheng, the "Ziyun Pavilion" and "Jade Girl Spring" where the famous Western Han scholar Yang Xiong studied, and the "Fule Temple" and "Taoyuan Cave" where Liu Bei met with Liu Zhang when he entered Shu.
    The products of this area are also very rich. This year, in the Mianyang area, in addition to grain, more than 35,000 dan of dried black fungus, taro slices, mai dong, and fu pian were purchased alone, along with more than 400 kinds of dang shen, gastrodia, and medicinal materials. In order to cooperate with the railway to gather and distribute materials and activate urban and rural exchanges, the entire area will build 260 kilometers of simple roads and 630 kilometers of rural roads this year. The newly built silk reeling factory, oil pressing factory, and other factories here are rapidly changing Mianyang's economic landscape.
    The train passes through intermittent shallow hills. When it reaches Baima Pass in Luojiang, someone points to a small green hillside and says: Look, that is Luofeng Slope, where Pang Tong, the Shu Prime Minister of the Three Kingdoms, died in battle. Not far from Pang Tong's tomb, surrounded by ancient cypresses, is a horse changing ditch, which is said to be the place where Liu Bei and Pang Tong exchanged horses.
    After Luojiang, a vast and boundless plain of green appears before one's eyes. Seeing the vast, beautiful, and fertile scenery, many passengers can't help but cheer. No wonder the poet Du Fu, after experiencing hardships and entering the western Sichuan Plain from Gansu, wrote such a majestic poem: "Lutou, how lofty it stands, satisfying hunger and thirst on this day; The mountains to the southwest are cut off, overlooking a thousand miles of openness. The traveler leaves the capital, Jianmen cannot be crossed, and now that the dangers are gone, I rejoice at the vastness of the plains."
    Looking out the window, one sees that the endless waist-deep rice on both sides of the railway, like green rivers and oceans, surge and flow on the fertile land. This is a river of grain, a sea of grain, the granary of our great motherland! The rivers running vertically and horizontally are like millions of silver snakes, shimmering in the sunlight. The villages surrounded by bamboo forests are like a constellation of islands, standing on the green rice sea. The fields are filled with the scenes of harvest everywhere. "Green bamboo shoots emerge to greet the boat, and river fish come to the table every day," Du Fu once described the scenery of Shu in this way.
    In this place "where water and drought follow people's will, and famine is unknown," known as the "land ocean," it is green all year round, and each mu of land produces an average of more than 1,200 or 1,300 jin of grain. The Wenjiang area, most of which belongs to the Dujiangyan irrigation area, produces 4 billion jin of grain annually, of which rice alone accounts for 3 billion jin.
    Not far from the railway line, one can also see ancient stone memorial arches in the fields, which are the remains of ancient post roads. Guihu Lake and Baoguang Temple in Xindu, and Dujiangyan and Qingcheng Mountain in Guanxian are all places where tourists gather. Tianhui Town, where Emperor Xuanzong of Tang took refuge from the rebellion, and Mimo Town, where Zhuge Liang is said to have practiced the Eight Trigrams Formation, are both on the railway line.
            Arriving in Chengdu
    At eight o'clock in the evening, when the train finished the Baoji-Chengdu Railway and arrived at its terminal station, Chengdu, amidst music and the noise of people, the train attendants politely bid farewell to the passengers.
    In the wide station yard, porters were busy loading and unloading seamless steel pipes, drilling rigs, local specialties, and grain. Four years ago, I witnessed the first groundbreaking of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway here, and now I have returned to the original place along the fully repaired railway. On July 1, 1952, the square where the celebration of the opening of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway and the groundbreaking ceremony of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway was held has now been replaced by a row of brand-new buildings and warehouses.
    Chengdu, a famous city with a history of more than 2,200 years, is now the capital of Sichuan Province, with a population of more than 700,000. The more than ten highways and railways connected here can lead to the heart of the motherland and distant borders. On the wide streets, rows of plane trees and courtyards with flourishing flowers and fruits can be seen everywhere. The rivers surrounding the city, amidst the green trees and bamboo groves, set off the city as particularly beautiful and quiet. People's Park, Du Fu Thatched Cottage, Wangjiang Tower, Wuhou Temple, Wenshu Monastery and many other picturesque scenic spots are even more attractive to tourists.
    Since the Han Dynasty, Chengdu has had huge academies. Famous Han Dynasty literati such as Sima Xiangru and Yang Xiong grew up and studied here. Now the city has more than ten universities and colleges. The newly built Chengdu Institute of Radio Engineering, the Geological Exploration College, the Sichuan Normal College and more than 20 professional technical schools will cultivate more talents for the country.
    Vigorous industrial construction has made Chengdu even younger. In the suburbs, from morning to evening, busy scenes of labor can be seen everywhere. A constant stream of trucks and carts transports bricks, wood, sand, and stones. In the past few years, Chengdu has built a large number of factories, schools, and residences every year, and this year's capital construction is more than 39% more than the sum of the previous three years. The largest mechanized brick and tile factory in the southwest, the meat joint processing factory, the modern Chengdu Cutting Tool Factory, and other huge factories will successively appear on the vast plains.
    As the mayor of Chengdu said: "Chengdu is moving from a consumer city to an industrial city. You see, in the near future, it will become a huge industrial center in the interior of the motherland."

    剑门关外别有天
    ——从宝鸡到成都之七
  　本报记者　纪希晨
    蜀道不再难
    过了雄伟的“一关高峙万峰盘，远客初惊蜀道难”的剑门山，眼前地势渐渐开阔起来。长满了松柏杉木的小山丘，重重叠叠，像绿色的城雉，一直延伸到天边。群山之间，玲珑蓊翠的盆地里，一阶阶的水梯田，像千万块闪灼发光的镜子，摆布在山丘的上面。这些典型的盆地景色告诉人们：火车已经开始进入四川的腹心地带了。
    几天来，我沿着崇峻的高山，翻过高耸入云的秦岭，穿过人烟稀少的地震地带，渡过千折万转的江流，跨过迢迢千里的大巴山，如今，当又来到沃野千里的“天府之国”的时候，一种喜出望外的心情，使我仿佛感觉自己进入了另一个天地。啊！富饶的四川，你的粮食产量占全国粮食总产量的十分之一以上，你怀中的七百种土特产畅销国内外许多地方；然而，在过去，尽管你孕育着丰富的物产和宝藏，可是凶山阻隔着你，恶水横断着你，粮食运不出去，土特产卖不出去。在你的怀抱里，粮食沤坏了，药材当柴烧了，矿山荒废了。当人们痛心地践踏着落在地下的水果的时候，他们是多么渴望能有一条沟通四川内外的铁路啊！
    如今，愿望变成了现实，火车日夜在你的怀中奔忙；就连感叹“蜀道之难，难于上青天”的伟大诗人李白的故乡——彰明县青莲乡也通火车了。这是多么叫人快心的喜事啊！已经建成的成渝，宝成铁路，正在赶修的川黔、成昆、内昆铁路，和省内四通八达的公路及内河航运，已经根本改变了昔日的蜀道面貌。假若李白今日重游四川，他将会发现：人民已在对联里改变了他的诗篇：
      人民坐江山，黄河也有澄清日；
      铁路联川陕，蜀道从此不再难。
      访李白故居
    车过彰明，我访问了李白的故乡。
    渡过清澈的涪江，老远就可以看见江对面一片翠林里，有一道耀眼的红墙；两个小孩指着红墙告诉我说：
    “看！那就是李白的祠堂！”
    诗人离开他的故乡，距今虽然已有一千二百三十多年了，可是这里的妇孺老幼，几乎没有一个不晓得李白的生平和名字的。为着纪念他，住在天宝山脚的农民，世世代代就以“太白”和他的妹妹“月圆”，来称呼他们的村庄。竹林环抱、绿稻如茵的太白村和月圆村，像一座秀丽的花园，座落在涪江左岸的平原上面。诗人李白，就在这一带的青山绿水间，度过了他的青年时代。
    李白故居“陇西院”门前石壁上刻着：“弟妹墓犹存，莫谓仙人空浪迹；秋文志可考，由来此地是故居”、“大华直接青莲宅，天宝遥看粉竹楼”、“旧日谪仙楼隐处，恍闻昔日读书声”等三首对联。李月圆的坟墓位于“陇西院”的旁侧。她每日梳妆的粉竹楼和李白的衣冠石墓的遗迹，都在青莲镇内。彰明县西三十里的大小匡山上，有著名的“李白读书台”。在这“孤峰秀拔，宛如文笔”的美丽的山水间，诗人写出了“访戴天山道士不遇”、“冬日归旧山”，和脍炙人口的“蜀道难”等诗篇。可惜，这些令人向往的古迹，全被破坏得面目皆非了。当地人民和旅人，期待政府把它修复起来。
    谈到“蜀道难”，白发苍苍的老人林绍贵，对我谈了一个李白骑竹马的传说：李白读书的地方，山高路险，诗人亲历“蜀道难”之苦，便制造了一匹竹马，骑着竹马，他每日往返数十里，从青莲乡沸花井打水研墨，到大小匡山去读书。
    如今，在诗人的家乡，铁马代替了竹马，火车穿梭在天宝山下，绿色的山野平原上，插起的许多勘察石油的红白标杆和旗帜，象征着未来这里将会有更大的繁荣。
          绿色的海洋
    再往南，就到了位于涪江中游和支流安昌江会合口上的古城绵阳。这儿有公路和航运下可通三台、遂宁、合江、重庆，上可达江油、广元入陕西、甘肃，自古即是四川北部的交通要道。这里至今还遗留有不少古代历史的纪念物。如全国罕有的雕刻造像“汉厥”，魏城大佛寺的唐代石刻，西汉著名学者杨雄读书的“子云亭”、“玉女泉”、刘备入蜀时与刘璋会见处的“富乐寺”、“桃园洞”等。
    这一带的物产也很丰富。今年，在绵阳专区除粮食外，单收购的木耳、芋片、麦冬、伏片就有三万五千多担，当参、天麻、药材四百多种。为着配合铁路集散物资，活跃城乡交流，今年全区将兴修二百六十公里简易公路，和六百三十公里乡村大路。这儿新建的缫丝厂、榨油厂及其他一些工厂，正迅速改变着绵阳的经济面貌。
    火车穿过时断时续的浅丘陵，到达罗江白马关时，有人指着一座绿色的小山坡说：看，那就是落凤坡，是三国蜀相庞统战死的地方。距古柏环抱的庞统坟不远，有一个换马沟，相传就是刘备和庞统换马的地点。
    过罗江后，眼前出现了绿茫茫的一片无边无际的大平原。看见那浩阔、美丽、富饶的景色，许多旅客都情不自禁的欢呼起来。无怪诗人杜甫，当历尽艰险，从甘肃进入川西平原的时候，写出那样气魄磅礴的诗篇：“鹿头何亭亭，是日慰饥渴；连山西南断，俯见千里豁。游子出京华，剑门不可越，及兹险阻尽，始喜原野阔”。
    举目窗外，只见铁路两旁一望无际的齐腰深的稻子，像绿色的河流和海洋，汹涌澎湃，滚滚奔流在富饶的大地上。这是粮食的河，是粮食的海，是我们伟大祖国的粮仓！左右纵横的河流，像千万条银蛇，在阳光下荡漾发光。竹林环绕的村庄，好似星罗棋布的群岛，矗立在绿茫茫的稻海上。田野里，到处都充溢着丰收的景象。“青青竹笋迎船出，日日江鱼入馔来”，杜甫曾这样描述过蜀中的风光。
    在这“水旱从人，不知饥馑”，被人称为“陆地海洋”的地方，一年四季都披着绿装，每亩土地平均产粮一千二、三百斤以上。大部属于都江堰灌区的温江专区，每年产粮四十亿斤，其中单水稻即三十亿斤。
    距铁路线不远，在田野里还可看到一座座古石碑坊，那是古代驿道的遗迹。新都的桂湖、宝光寺，灌县的都江堰、青城山都是游人云集的地方。唐玄宗入蜀避乱的天回镇、传说中诸葛亮修八阵图练兵的弥牟镇，都在铁路边上。
            到达成都
    黄昏八点钟，当火车走尽了宝成铁路，到达它的终点车站成都的时候，在音乐和人声喧嚷中，列车员客气地向旅客们告别问好。
    宽阔的站场里，搬运工人正忙着上下搬卸无缝钢管、钻探机、土特产和粮食。四年前，在这儿，我目击了宝成铁路第一次破土，如今又沿着全线修好的铁路，回到了原来的地方。1952年7月1日，那曾经举行过庆祝成渝铁路通车和宝成铁路开工典礼的广场，如今已盖起了一排崭新的楼房和货仓。
    成都，这座有二千二百多年历史的名城，现在是四川省的首府，有七十多万人口。连接在这里的十多条公路和铁路，可以通向祖国的心脏和遥远的边疆。宽阔的街道上，到处可见成行的梧桐和花果繁茂的庭院。环绕城周的河流，在绿树竹丛中，把城市衬托得分外秀丽和幽静。人民公园、杜甫草堂、望江楼、武侯祠、文殊院等许多美丽如画的名胜古迹，更是吸引游人的地方。
    从汉代起，成都就有了巨大的书院，汉朝著名文人司马相如、杨雄等生长、攻读在这里。现在全市有十多所大专学校，新建的成都电讯工程学院、地质勘探学院、四川师范学院和二十多所专业技术学校，将为国家培养更多的人材。
    蓬勃的工业建设，把成都变得更加年青了。在郊外，从清晨到傍晚，到处都能看到紧张劳动的场面，川流不息的卡车、板车、往来运送着砖木砂石。过去几年，成都每年都要建设大批的厂房、学校和住宅，而今年的基本建设比前三年的总和还多39％以上。西南最大的机制砖瓦厂、肉类联合加工厂、现代化的成都刃具厂和其他巨大的工厂，都将陆续出现在辽阔的平原上。
    正如成都市长所说：“成都正由一个消费城市向工业城市前进着。你看吧，不久的将来，它就要成为祖国内地的一个巨大工业中心了。”
