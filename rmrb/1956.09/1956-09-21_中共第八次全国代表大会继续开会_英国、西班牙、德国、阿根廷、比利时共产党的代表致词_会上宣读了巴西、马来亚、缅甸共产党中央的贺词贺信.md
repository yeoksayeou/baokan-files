Xinhua News Agency, September 20th—The Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China continued its session at 2:00 PM this afternoon.

    Chen Yun (Secretary of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee, Vice Premier of the State Council) spoke at today's meeting, discussing the idea that within the socialist unified market, the state market should be the main body, with a certain range of free markets under state leadership attached. This sparked great interest among the delegates and foreign guests present. Chen Yun said that this kind of free market under state leadership is suitable for our country's conditions and the needs of the people. Its emergence is a result of changing the measures taken in the past to restrict capitalist industry and commerce and effectively correcting some local and temporary errors that occurred in the process of socialist transformation. Chen Yun also put forward some measures that should be taken to correct these shortcomings and errors.

    The first speaker at today's meeting was Liu Ren (Second Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the CPC). He focused on expressing his opinions on the socialist transformation and construction issues in the capital.

    All delegates warmly welcomed the representatives of the fraternal parties to deliver their speeches. The representatives of the fraternal parties stepped onto the podium one after another amidst the applause of the entire audience. When they finished their speeches, the whole audience stood up again and applauded warmly for their speeches filled with proletarian international friendship.

    Comrade Pollitt, head of the British Communist Party delegation, said in his speech that the victory of the Chinese people is one of the greatest events of the twentieth century. The British working people have always held warm friendly feelings towards the Chinese people. The vast majority of the British people support the People's Republic of China's entry into the United Nations.

    Comrade Pollitt pointed out that the moment will eventually come when the British people will make the decision to end the rule of capitalists and landlords and take the road to socialism in the British way. Pollitt said, "We believe that such a day is not far away." Thunderous applause rang through the audience.

    The speech of Comrade Ibarruri, head of the Spanish Communist Party delegation, was constantly interrupted by the delegates' applause. She said that today China is laying the foundation of a socialist society, while the Spanish people are continuing their struggle against fascism and their struggle for Spanish democracy. When she said in a loud voice, "We are sure that in the near future, our streets will also hold celebrations," the whole audience burst into long-lasting applause.

    The representative of the Brazilian Communist Party delegation read a congratulatory message from the Central Committee of the Brazilian Communist Party, signed by General Secretary Prestes. When he read, "In our struggle to lead our people to fight for freedom, independence, and the progress of Brazil, we deeply feel that the victory of the Chinese people's revolution and the construction of the new China are playing a progressive role in the lives of all oppressed nations," warm applause broke out throughout the audience. Comrade Lehmann, head of the German Communist Party delegation, expressed strong confidence when speaking about countering the Adenauer government's persecution of the German Communist Party in his speech. He said, "The whole world can see that we are not isolated in carrying out our struggle in West Germany. And at the same time, it is made very clear to the reactionary forces that the era of pushing forward their aggressive policies at home and abroad with impunity is gone forever." All the delegates repeatedly applauded warmly, expressing their respect for the heroic struggle of the German communists and the German people.

    Zhang Guohua (Deputy Secretary of the Tibet Work Committee of the CPC) then spoke, talking about the achievements of the work in Tibet over the past six years and the tasks after the establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region.

    Ke Qingshi (Secretary of the Shanghai Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, First Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the CPC) spoke at the meeting. He talked about the achievements and experiences gained by Shanghai in implementing the Party's policy of socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce.

    Song Renqiong (Deputy Secretary-General of the CPC Central Committee) focused on the issue of the Party's collective leadership in his speech. He used the agricultural cooperativization and agricultural production increase movement as examples to illustrate the close and inseparable relationship between collective leadership and the mass line.

    Comrade Alvarez, head of the Argentine Communist Party delegation, said that the resolutions of the Eighth National Congress of the CPC will not only help consolidate the socialist camp but will also greatly promote the greatest and broadest friendship among the people of all countries. All this will be a huge support for the peace movement and for the movement of men and women all over the world to avoid the horrors of war and strive for disarmament and peaceful understanding among the people of all countries. He said that the "working class and people of Argentina want to live a life of freedom, independence, progress, and peace, and are fighting for it." At this moment, warm applause rang through the audience.

    Lai Ruoyu, the executive chairman of the conference, read a congratulatory letter from the Central Committee of the Malayan Communist Party signed by Chairman Ahmed and General Secretary Chen Ping. The congratulatory letter said that the achievements of the Chinese people have encouraged the people of all countries to move forward more firmly along their own paths. The people of all ethnic groups in Malaya are continuing to wage an unyielding struggle to restore domestic peace. They eagerly hope that the people of all countries will provide sympathy and support in restoring peace in Malaya. They also welcome all kinds of international good-faith mediation that is beneficial to restoring peace in Malaya. The congratulatory letter pointed out that if peace in Malaya can be restored, it will not only be a blessing for the people of all ethnic groups in Malaya, but also a major contribution to peace in Asia and the world. The delegates responded to these words with warm applause.

    Comrade Van Moerkerke, head of the Belgian Communist Party delegation, said that New China enjoys great prestige in Belgium, not only because New China has a vast territory and a population of 600 million, but more importantly because of the achievements it has made in new economic construction and its unwavering implementation of a policy of peace and easing international tensions. His words were welcomed by the delegates' applause.

    Executive Chairman Lai Ruoyu read the congratulatory letter from the Central Committee of the Burmese Communist Party. The congratulatory letter said, "Burma and China have been close and friendly neighbors since ancient times, and the formulation of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence has made the relationship between the people of China and Burma even closer." When Lai Ruoyu read, "This congress will take a step forward in completing China's socialist construction and will continue to develop and consolidate world peace," warm applause rang through the audience.

    Tao Zhu (First Secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the CPC) spoke on several issues of agricultural production in Guangdong Province. He talked about the effectiveness of implementing the policy of focusing on agriculture in Guangdong Province over the past four years and the measures for increasing agricultural production and developing cash crops in the future.

    Peng Qing (Director of the Hebei Provincial Women's Federation), Zhou Guanwu (Director of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant), Tang Lin (Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the CPC), and Song Zhihe (Minister of Finance and Trade Department of the Henan Provincial Committee of the CPC) expressed their opinions on the development of female party members, the development of the steel industry, opposing bureaucracy, and improving rural industrial and commercial taxation, respectively.
