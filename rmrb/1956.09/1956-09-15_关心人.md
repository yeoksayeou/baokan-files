Caring Person
　　Fang Ji

    (Continued from yesterday)

    Looking at his distressed appearance, I wanted to comfort him, but it was impossible. I could only say:
     “Go on, Comrade Li Wenguang.”
    Perhaps my voice revealed the sympathy in my heart, he raised his eyes, looked at me with what seemed like some emotion, swallowed, and continued.
     “Last April, I fell ill. I left work two hours early on the first day, and asked for two days of leave with a note on the second day. But when I went to work on the fourth day, the shift leader marked me down for three days of absenteeism, and even put up a blackboard bulletin, saying I was an ‘absentee king,’ an old habit not changed, and demanded that I make a self-criticism in the group…"
    As he spoke, his voice became somewhat low. I explained:
     “Then you just explain it and it’s over.”
     “Yes!” He suddenly raised his voice again. “I couldn't write the self-criticism, and in anger, I took the lamp and went home. The shift leader wanted me to suspend work and reflect on my mistakes, so I didn’t go to work or reflect, but just lay at home sleeping! The chairman of the trade union talked to me, and I said: If they don't remove the dismissal, I won't reflect or go to work! So the mine manager issued an order, dismissing me from my position as group leader, and not issuing my field allowance.”
    At this point, I really wanted to rebuke him for this unreasonable behavior. But I couldn't bring myself to say it. Because when he talked about these things, he was neither angry nor sad; instead, there was a bitter smile on his face. Like someone who has seen through something, understood it thoroughly, and made up their mind about it. So, I felt that the matter was serious. When a person's self-esteem is damaged, this is often the case!
    We were silent together, for a long time, no one spoke. There were other people sitting in the room, and they were the same.
    Finally, I had to speak first, but it was no longer asking questions, but more like persuading:
     “Go on, finish it, Comrade Li Wenguang.”
     “It’s finished.” he said. His voice carried a tone of helpless mockery. “After that, they assigned me to the preparation team. As an assistant, pushing slag, carrying timber, driving a cart, boiling water, cooking…just like what's written in the summary material, the entire mine, three mining areas, four types of work, eight units, sixty-two groups, I've done it all!”
    Having said that, he laughed.
     “Happy to do it?” I asked.
    He didn’t answer.
     “Any opinions?”
    He still didn’t answer.
     “Want to go home?”
    He still didn’t answer. But suddenly, I saw, from his eyes, two very large, bright tears fell, with a 'plop' sound, onto the newspaper in front of him. He seemed startled, and immediately wiped his wide palm across the newspaper, as if to wipe away the tears; at the same time, a smile appeared on his face, and he sighed, saying:
     “At the time, I thought: Li Wenguang, Li Wenguang, you are so young, will you end up like this? Of those who came up the mountain together, some became Party members, some became League members, and you yourself, will soon not even be a trade union member!"
    He said pensively, with his head lowered. The whole room was quiet, and no one interrupted him.
     “Yes,” he continued. “I had thought about going home. But, in this state, who would look up to me back home?
     “At first, I wasn't used to it, I wasn't at peace, I wanted to go home. But after doing it for these few years, I couldn't bear to leave. Even later, when things got to this stage, I still couldn't bear to leave this mine!
     “Besides, there are always two people on this mountain who look up to me...”
    At this moment, someone pushed the door open and came in, interrupting his words. However, this person, walked in quietly. Perhaps it was because the atmosphere in the room seemed too serious at this moment, or perhaps this person was originally so modest. Gently pushing open the door, gently walking in, gently sitting down next to Li Wenguang.
    Before anyone could introduce him, everyone eagerly waited for Li Wenguang to finish this paragraph. That person didn't speak, but Li Wenguang nodded to him and continued:
     “One is him, Chen Xingqi.”
    Immediately, everyone turned their attention to him. The way they looked at him, was like looking at a hero just back from the battlefield. Because it seemed that he was the one who had saved Li Wenguang. But this made him very uneasy! His face turned red, and he didn't know where to put his hands; he could only lower his head and rub his knees vigorously with both hands.
    At this moment, I turned to Li Wenguang again:
     “Who is the other one?”
     “What?” He seemed to have forgotten what he had just said, and like everyone else, stared at Chen Xingqi.
     “The person who looks up to you.”
    He turned his head, smiled, became embarrassed, and said softly:
     “Myself.”
    (III)

    According to the title, this article should mainly be about Chen Xingqi. Because the person who cared for Li Wenguang, was concerned about him, looked up to him, and helped him progress, was precisely Chen Xingqi. But he arrived late. And he simply couldn't speak. About how he helped Li Wenguang, he couldn't say anything. It seemed that he really felt that there was nothing worth saying about it. Isn’t caring for people the duty of people? It’s self-evident, what is there to say?
    He sat there silently. As if he himself, his appearance, his modesty and simplicity, had already proven this point.
    We asked him, how did you help Li Wenguang? He didn't talk about himself, but instead started talking about Li Wenguang.
     “A young man, with energy and strength, and not confused, why would he be willing to lag behind? The more people look down on him, the less motivated he is to work. When work is arranged well, and everyone works together, they will compete with each other to do better. If it's done well, it belongs to everyone; if it's not done well, everyone doesn't complain - if the work isn't done well, he himself won't feel good, if you complain and criticize him again, he'll have no reason, but he'll have reason instead…”
    He spoke very softly, slowly and methodically, just like the way he walked in just now. Before he finished speaking, Li Wenguang impatiently interjected.
     “In Old Chen’s group, no one has ever criticized me. Even Lian Shunzhang, who has never helped anyone in his life, helped me.”
     “At first,” Chen Xingqi continued. “When Li Wenguang came, some comrades in the group were also unhappy. So I explained these principles to them…”
     “What about Li Wenguang, what did you say to Li Wenguang?” I seized the opportunity and quickly asked, wanting to find a set of "advanced experiences in helping those who lag behind" from him.
    But to my surprise, he stopped talking. He slowly smoked his cigarette, but sweat was breaking out on his face.
     “You have to know, this set of experiences of yours is valuable!” I continued to “enlighten” him, and especially emphasized the word “valuable”!
     “It’s nothing more than,” he wiped his sweat, had to say something, and then he said one sentence, then another sentence. “Talking about things in life… when he’s sick, I often go to see him – a person, when he's sick, always wants people to visit. Also, when he can't figure things out, I enlighten him…”
     “Is that all?” I seemed a little disappointed, and even stopped taking notes.
     “What else is there?” He didn’t notice my dissatisfaction, and was seriously thinking.
     “Also talking about the unity of personal interests and national interests." Li Wenguang couldn’t help but interject again. He now seemed completely relaxed and happy, trying his best to help his friend out of a tight spot. "He also told me to keep up with society…”
     “These grand principles, I heard in reports, I can’t explain them completely myself…”
     “Oh, Old Chen!” Li Wenguang then continued, this time speaking to Chen Xingqi. “You look up to me, and want me to come to your group, that's enough, what else can I say? When a person gets to the point where no one wants him, everyone looks down on him, and then someone says: Come on, let's work together! Isn't that enough? So when I went, I thought: Others are people, I am also a person; others look up to me, I can't drag down other people's advanced group!”
    “You've been doing pretty well lately?” Old Chen verified.
    “It's still because of your good leadership." Li Wenguang said, they started pushing each other. "Old Chen is good at this point: he handles things practically. If there are achievements, he doesn't hide them at all; if there are shortcomings, he corrects them immediately, and doesn't hold them in his heart. Once, I was sick for three days, and didn't ask for leave, and he didn't mark me down as absent. That's what you call handling things practically…”
    He spoke earnestly and enthusiastically. I, however, was a little annoyed that Li Wenguang was talking too much. At this time, I wanted to listen to Old Chen, but he was talking non-stop. So, I interrupted him impolitely:
    “Old Chen, why don't you talk about it yourself!”
    He raised his head, thought for a while, and said:
    “That’s all. Little Li is right: When I first came up the mountain, wasn't I also uneasy? Comparing oneself to others, one can understand their difficulties. For example, me, my father died when I was four years old, and my family didn't have anything! I helped people herd cattle when I was seven years old, and became a hired worker when I was twelve years old, working hard from morning till night, who ever asked about me? Now the leadership cares about the workers, shouldn't I care about others? A person, raised by their parents, no matter what they do, they have to be like a person. When you write a letter home, your old mother will be happy when she sees it. The leadership is the same, like an old mother…”
    This time he spoke a little more smoothly, his voice was not loud, but every sentence entered the ear. I secretly punched myself on the thigh, closed my notebook, and stopped digging for any experience! It turned out that caring for people is like this - comparing hearts to hearts, and then you understand!
    At this time, I couldn’t raise any more questions, I just silently looked at Li Wenguang, and then looked at Chen Xingqi, and my mind was filled with the entire life of our era – isn’t it because of this that we are united and victorious?
    At this moment, the whistle for starting work sounded outside the window. The whistle on this three or four thousand meter mine, loudly and joyfully roared. It seemed that even the clouds wrapped around the mountainside were startled, and quickly dodged away with the wind. The whistle didn't stop, the roar went straight into the clouds, as if wanting the whole world to hear, in this border area of the motherland, on the mine in the depths of the white clouds, people, laboring, are developing the resources of the motherland; and also developing the resources of people's sincere hearts, with unlimited friendship and love…(The End)

    关心人
  　方纪
    （续昨）
    望着他那难过的样子，我想安慰他几句，但却不可能。只好说：
     “说下去吧！李文广同志。”
    也许我的声音透露了我心里的同情，他抬起眼睛，似乎有些感动地望着我，咽了口唾沫，又说下去。
     “去年4月，我病了。头一天早下班两个钟头，第二天打条子请了两天假。但到第四天去上班的时候，值班长却给我打了三个旷工，还出了黑板报，说我‘旷工大王’，旧性不改，要我在小组里作检讨。……”
    他说着，声音有些低沉。我解释说：
     “那你说明一下就完了。”
     “是呵！”他忽然又提高了声音。“检讨不来，一生气，提起灯回家了。值班长要我停职反省，我就不上班，也不反省，躺在家里睡大觉！工会主席找我谈话，我就说：不撤职，我就不反省，也不上班！于是矿长下令，撤了我的小组长，野外津贴也没有发。”
    这时，我可真想责备他的这种无理胡闹。但是又说不出口来。因为他说这些事的时候，既不生气，也不难过；反而脸上带着一丝苦笑。就像一个人，对某种事情看透了，看穿了，下了决心时的那样。于是，我感觉到事情严重了。当一个人的自尊心被损害了的时候，便往往如此！
    我们一起沉默着，好久，谁也不做声。屋子里还坐了其他的人，也都一样。
    最后，还只得我先开口，但已经不是发问题，而像是在劝解：
     “说吧，说完吧，李文广同志。”
     “完了。”他说。声音里带着一种无可奈何的嘲笑的口气。“以后，又编了我预备班。当助手，推渣子，扛木料，赶马车，烧水，做饭……就像总结材料上所写的，整个矿山，三个矿区，四个工种，八个单位，六十二个小组，我都做过了！”
    说完，他笑起来。
     “高兴做吗？”我问。
    他不作声。
     “有意见？”
    他也不作声。
     “想回家了？”
    他仍然不作声。可是忽然，我看见，从他的眼睛里，掉下两颗挺大挺大的放光的眼泪，扑搭一声，落在他眼前的报纸上。他像是被吓了一跳，立刻把他那宽大的手掌在报纸上一抹，像是要把眼泪抹掉；同时脸上浮起一个微笑，叹一口气说：
     “当时，我想：李文广，李文广，年纪青青，你就这样完了吗？一同上山来的，有的成了党员，有的成了团员，你自己，快连个工会会员都当不成了！”
    他沉思般地说，低着头。满屋里静悄悄的，谁也不再打断他。
     “是的，”他继续说下去。“回家，也想到过。可是，就这样子，回到家里，会有谁看得起呢？
     “起初，我不习惯，不安心，想回家。可是干了这几年，却舍不得了。就是后来，弄到这步天地，我也舍不得这座矿山了！
     “何况，这山上，总还有两个人看得起我。……”
    这时，一个人，推门进来，打断了他的话。但是，这个人，轻轻的走进来。也许是此刻室里的空气显得太严肃，也许这个人原来就是这样谦虚。轻轻地推开门，轻轻地走进来，轻轻地，坐在了李文广旁边。
    大家来不及介绍，都急切地等李文广把这一段话说完。那人也不开口，李文广却把头向他一点，接着说：
     “一个，就是他，陈兴启。”
    立刻，大家都把目光转向他。那样子，像看待一个刚从战场上下来的英雄。因为好像是他，才挽救了李文广。但这却弄得他十分局促不安！脸也红了，手不知放在哪里好；只得低下头去，双手用力地擦着他的?膝盖。
    这时，我又转向李文广：
     “还有一个呢？”
     “什么？”他像是忘记了自己方才说的话，也像大家一样，把眼睛注视着陈兴启。
     “看得起你的人。”
    他转过头来，笑了笑，不好意思起来，轻轻说：
     “我自己。”
        （三）
    按照题目，这篇文章主要应该是写陈兴启的。因为关心人，关心李文广，看得起他，并帮助他进步的，正是陈兴启。但是，他来迟了。而且他简直不会说话。关于他怎样帮助李文广的，什么也说不出。看起来，他真是觉得这没有什么值得说的。人关心人，这不是人的义务么？天经地义，有什么值得说的呢？
    他默默地坐在那里。仿佛他本身，他那副样子，他的谦虚和朴素，就已经证明了这一点。
    我们问他，怎样帮助李文广的？他不说自己，却倒说起李文广来了。
     “一个年青人，有气有力，又不糊涂，为什么愿意落后呢？大家越看不起他，他干活就越没有劲。工作安排好了，大伙一起干，就会一个赛一个。干好了，是大家的；干不好，大家也不埋怨——活没有干好，他自己心里就不会痛快，你再埋怨，打击，他没有理，倒会有理了。……”
    他说话很轻，慢条斯理，就像他刚才走路一样。话没有完，李文广却性急地插进来了。
     “在老陈组里，可没有谁打击过我。连顺章，一辈子没有帮助过谁，也帮助了我。”
     “起初，”陈兴启接着说下去。“李文广来，组里同志也有不乐意的。我就把这些道理讲给他们听。……”
     “对李文广呢，对李文广你讲些什么？”我瞅准机会，赶快发问，想要从他身上找一套“先进帮助落后的经验”。
    那知这一问，他倒不说了。慢条斯理地抽着烟，脸上却直冒汗。
     “要知道，你这套经验，可是宝贵呢！”我继续“启发”他，还特别强调了“宝贵”二字！
     “无非是，”他擦擦汗，不得不说了，便想一句，讲一句。“讲些生活中的事情。……他病了，常常看看——一个人嘛，生了病，总愿意人去看看。再有，他想不开的时候，开导开导。……”
     “就这些吗？”我似乎有点失望，连笔记也停止了。
     “还有什么呢？”“他没有察觉我的不满足，认真地在想。
     “也讲个人利益和国家利益一致。”李文广又耐不住地插进来。他现在完全轻松愉快似的，尽力想来替他的朋友解围。“还叫我跟上社会。……”
     “这些大道理，都是听报告听来的，自己也讲不全。……”
     “唉，老陈！”李文广又接下去，这回是对着陈兴启。“你看得起我，要我到你们组里，这就够了，我还能说什么呢？一个人，弄得到处没人要，人人看不起，这时有一个人说：来吧，咱们一块干！这不就行了？因此我一去就想：人家是人，我也是人；人家看得起我，咱不能把人家的先进组扯垮！”
    “这一阵，你是干得不坏？”老陈证实说。
    “还是你领导的好。”李文广说，他们倒互相推让起来了。“老陈就是这点好：按实际办事。有成绩，一点也不隐瞒；有缺点，随说随过，不记在心里。有一次，我还不是病了三天，没有打条子请假，也没有给我打旷工。这叫按实际办事。……”
    他说得认真而且热烈。我呢，却有点怪李文广多话。这时，我是想听老陈的，他却说起来没有完了。于是，我便不客气地打断他：
    “老陈，还是你自己说说吧！”
    他抬起头来，想了想，说：
    “就这些。小李说得对：起初上山，自己也不是不安心过？将己比人，就能了解人的难处。比方我，四岁死了父亲，家里一样没有！七岁帮人放牛，十二岁就当雇工，一天累到晚，有谁问过？现在领导关心工人，自己能不关心别人？一个人，父母养一场，无论干什么，要得像个人。写封信回家，老娘看了也欢喜。领导也一样，就像个老母亲。……”
    他这回说得顺当一点，声音不高，却句句入耳。我暗暗在大腿上捶了自己一拳头，合上笔记本，再也不挖什么经验了！原来，人关心人，就是这样——将心比心，也就懂得了！
    这时，我再提不出什么问题了，只是默默地，看看李文广，又看看陈兴启，脑子里翻起了我们这个时代的整个的生活——我们之所以团结，胜利，不就是因为这样吗？
    这时窗外响起上工的汽笛。汽笛在这三四千公尺的矿山，大声地，快乐地吼叫着。像是连绕在半山上的云也吃了一惊，随着风，赶紧躲开去。汽笛却没有停，吼声直上云霄，像是要全世界都听见，在这祖国的边疆，白云深处的矿山上，人们，劳动着，在开发祖国的富源；同时也开发着人的真诚的、有着无限友谊和爱的心灵的富源。……（完）
