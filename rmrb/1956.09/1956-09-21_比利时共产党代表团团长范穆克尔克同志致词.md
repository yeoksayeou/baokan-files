Comrades,

    Please allow me, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Belgian Communist Party, to extend fraternal congratulations to your Eighth National Congress from the Belgian Communists and all peace-loving and progressive people in our country.
    Belgium is a small country, and although it cannot play a decisive role in international affairs, it does have a certain importance.
    Belgium, through its colony in the Congo, possesses almost all of the capitalist world's uranium production.
    The heads of our government – the great capitalists – are determined to use this uranium for the needs of war preparations. With the collusion of previous governments, Belgian financiers have handed over this wealth to the American warmongers. They are using uranium to make atomic and hydrogen bombs, which they are stockpiling to use against all of humanity.
    Of course, this established policy of our government leaders is contrary to the will of the working people of our country. The Belgian Communist Party and progressive people's constant struggle to use uranium for the peaceful endeavors of all mankind is a manifestation of the will of our working people. It should be pointed out that the Soviet Union's proposals regarding atomic energy have aroused a huge response in our country.
    Our government has been forced to make some modifications to the treaties concluded between Belgium and the United States, just as in the past the government was forced, under pressure from the masses, to reduce the term of military service from twenty-four months to eighteen months.
    However, these modifications are not decisive. The control of the United States over Belgium is so strong, and some leading figures are so obsequious to international financiers, that extensive activity is still needed to adapt Belgium to the easing of international tensions. The Belgian Communist Party will certainly fulfill this task entrusted to them by all of humanity.
    Comrades! New China enjoys great prestige in Belgium, not only because New China has a vast territory and a population of 600 million, but more importantly because of its achievements in new economic construction and its unwavering implementation of a policy of peace and easing international tensions.
    Therefore, the official recognition of the People's Republic of China by Belgium has become the demand of the vast majority of people in all walks of life in Belgium. The National Congress of the Belgian Socialist Party, which holds a majority position in the current government, has twice unanimously adopted motions demanding the establishment of diplomatic relations with People's China. This motion embodies the deep aspirations of the Belgian working class. Some leading figures of Belgian financial and financial groups, driven by increasingly pressing economic needs, also support the recognition of New China. Our Speaker of the House of Representatives, Camille Huysmans, an old fighter in the Belgian and international workers' movement, will soon visit China. We are convinced that after the parliamentary delegation he leads returns home, it will make the greatest effort to develop friendly relations between our two countries and recognize People's China.
    Dear delegates! In any case, you can believe that a responsible government, most of whose members need to obtain the support of the Belgian working class, will soon end the situation of turning a deaf ear to the urgent demand to recognize a country that plays a huge and decisive role in international affairs, even if American imperialists oppose it.
    Comrade Delegates! I wish you success in your work and great victories in building a socialist society and in the struggle for peace!
    Long live the Chinese Communist Party and its ten million members, and the Party Central Committee, led by Comrade Mao Zedong and composed of long-tested Marxist-Leninists!
    Long live the unity of the Communist and Workers' Parties of the world, which share the common goal of realizing human happiness and freedom!
    Long live socialism! (Attached picture)

### 比利时共产党代表团团长范穆克尔克同志致词

    比利时共产党代表团团长范穆克尔克同志致词亲爱的同志们：
    请允许我代表比利时共产党中央委员会向你们第八次全国党代表大会致以比利时共产党人和我国所有热爱和平和进步的人们的兄弟般的祝贺。
    比利时是一个小国，虽然它在国际事务中并不能起决定性的作用，但是它却具有一定的重要性影响。
    比利时借它在刚果的殖民地，占有了资本主义世界中几乎全部铀产量。
    我国政府的首脑们——大富豪们，决意把这些铀用作备战的需要，比利时的大金融家在同前几届政府的合谋下，已把这笔财富交给了美国的战争贩子们。他们用铀来制造原子弹和氢弹，他们储存这些炸弹就是为了反对全人类。
    当然，我国政府首脑们的这种既定政策是与我国劳动人民的意志相抵触的。比利时共产党和进步人士为使铀用于全人类和平事业所作的不断的斗争，就是我国劳动人民意志的表现。应该指出：苏联提出的有关原子能方面的建议在我国已引起巨大的反应。
    我国政府已被迫对比利时和美国所缔结的条约作了若干修改，就像过去在群众的压力下政府曾被迫将兵役期限由二十四个月减至十八个月所作的一样。
    但是这些修改并不起决定性的作用，美国对比利时的控制是如此之强，某些首脑人物对国际金融家是如此卑躬屈膝，要使比利时适应国际紧张局势的缓和，尚须进行广泛的活动。比利时共产党一定会完成全人类所交给他们的这一任务。
    同志们！新中国在比利时享有很大的威望，这不仅由于新中国有辽阔的疆土和六亿人口，更重要的是在于它在新的经济建设方面所取得的成就和它坚定不移地执行了和平与缓和国际紧张局势的政策。
    因此，比利时正式承认中华人民共和国已成为比利时各阶层广大人民的要求了。在现政府中占有多数地位的比利时社会党的全国代表大会曾两次一致通过要求和人民中国建立外交关系的动议，这一动议体现了比利时工人阶级的深切愿望。比利时的一些财政和金融集团的首脑人物，在经济方面日益迫切的需要的推动下，也赞成承认新中国。我们的众议院议长、比利时和国际工人运动的老战士卡米尔·欧斯曼斯即将来中国访问，我们深信，他所率领的议会代表团回国以后，一定会在发展我们两国之间的友好关系和承认人民中国方面作最大的努力。
    亲爱的代表同志们！无论如何，你们可以相信：一个负责的政府而其中大多数的成员要取得比利时工人阶级的支持，对迫切要求承认一个在国际事务中起极大决定作用的国家这件事情竟充耳不闻，这种情况是很快就会结束的，那怕美帝国主义者从中加以反对。
    代表同志们！祝你们工作顺利，祝你们在建设社会主义社会和争取和平的斗争中取得伟大的胜利！
    中国共产党和它的一千万名党员以及以毛泽东同志为典范的由久经考验的马克思列宁主义者所组成的党中央万岁！
    以实现人类幸福和自由为共同目的的全世界共产党和工人党的团结万岁！
    社会主义万岁！（附图片）
