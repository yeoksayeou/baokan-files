　　Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 21st. The Lesser Khingan Mountains Geological Team of the Heilongjiang River Basin Comprehensive Survey Team has discovered extremely valuable non-ferrous metal mineral outcrops and fairly widespread mineralization phenomena in the vast area of the southern Lesser Khingan Mountains.
　　The Chinese and Soviet geological experts of the survey team established two geological teams for the Greater and Lesser Khingan Mountains in late July this year to conduct in-depth geological surveys in the mountainous areas. In two months, they traveled thousands of miles, surveyed the vast areas along the Heilongjiang River such as Luobei County, and along the Sui-Jia, Mu-Jia, and Ha-Mu three railways. They discovered and collected dozens of boxes of extremely valuable ores and rocks, and conducted exploration and research on the newly discovered graphite, iron, and other mineral deposits.

    新华社哈尔滨21日电　黑龙江流域综合考察队的小兴安岭地质队，在小兴安岭南部广大地区，发现了极有价值的有色金属矿苗和相当普遍的矿化现象。
    考察队的中、苏两国地质专家在今年7月下旬建立了大、小兴安岭两个地质队，深入山区进行地质调查。他们在二个月中，跋涉了几千里，勘查了沿黑龙江的萝北等县和绥佳、牡佳、哈牡等三条铁路沿线的广大地区，发现和采集了极有价值的矿石、岩石数十箱，并对新近发现的石墨、铁等矿藏进行了勘查和研究。
