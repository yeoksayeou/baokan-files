    People Change Year After Year
    Liu Guojun, Representative of the National People's Congress, Manager of Changzhou Textile Printing and Dyeing Industrial Company
    On April 15, 1956, I departed from Changzhou to inspect Jingjiang, Subei, a journey that lasted ten days. Due to time constraints, the inspection area was limited to Jingjiang County. In addition to individual meetings with local leaders, local figures, agricultural cooperative chairmen, and factory directors, I participated in three general meetings and four discussion sessions, mainly listening to reports from various parties. As a native of Jingjiang, I should say I am not entirely unfamiliar with the situation in my hometown, but almost everything I saw and heard made me feel excited and exceeded my expectations. Therefore, this inspection was also a real-world education for me personally.
          The Situation Before Liberation
    The situation in Jingjiang in the past was as follows: the county had a population of over 400,000, while the land, including house foundations and grave sites that did not produce anything, was only over 600,000 mu, averaging less than 1.5 mu per person. In reality, the truly laboring peasants did not even have this much, as most of the land was concentrated in the hands of a small number of landlords and rich peasants. In terms of production, only the "sand fields" along the river could grow rice, with relatively high yields. However, the majority of the land had very low yields. Therefore, most peasants lived in thatched huts and drank thin gruel; only a few landlords and rich peasants could afford to eat rice regularly.
    Jingjiang had no industry in the past, and even small handicrafts were underdeveloped. Agricultural production was also so low, that people were naturally impoverished, commerce was out of the question, and education could not develop.
    The hometown I knew was isolated and impoverished, and especially after enemy destruction and the long-term oppression of reactionary rule, it was full of devastation, showing a scene of decline and decay. In my previous impression, the single word "miserable" summed up everything.
    Now, relying on the leadership of the Party and government, production has increased, and the entire county and towns have changed.
    The hometown I came into contact with this time is truly like the ancients said: "The city walls remain the same, but the people are all different." This "people are all different" needs a new explanation. It is not to say that all the people have been replaced, but that the fathers, elders, and brothers I saw have changed from appearance to inner expression. Their clothes are neatly worn, and their faces are radiant. The old no longer sigh, the young are busy with work, and the young have the opportunity to study. Their luck is much better than in my childhood. I carefully observed that although there were no major changes in the streets, many things had been added. Jingjiang City and Shengci Town both have electric lights, People's Banks, and Xinhua Bookstores. Although the other existing shops still have old signs, their content is different. They have supplies from department stores and their goods are abundant. They understand the principle of serving consumers and organize door-to-door delivery to the countryside. Even traditional Chinese medicine shops are like this. An old medicine shop I knew in Shengci, when they found that a prescription was missing an ingredient, was willing to go to a fellow shop three miles away to complete it, and then deliver it to the patient's home. I asked about this prescription, and it was worth only 28 cents, but they traveled 18 li (9km) back and forth to borrow and deliver the medicine. I asked him if he wasn't losing money by being busy for most of the day for this small transaction. He said: Being able to provide a complete prescription and serve the patient in a timely manner is very gratifying. I had never seen this kind of situation before liberation.
    Before liberation, Jingjiang County had only 25,000 primary school students. After liberation, the number increased year by year, reaching 42,500 in 1955, doubling the number. There was originally one junior high school, from over two hundred students to around four hundred. Now there are three junior high schools with over 2,300 students.
    It is also worth mentioning that a teacher, Mr. Sheng Yingbei, in Tuanjie Township, Gushan District, outside the east gate of Jingjiang, ran a junior high school tutoring class in this township, with excellent results. The masses requested that he add another class, but there were no classrooms. According to his estimate, only 400 yuan would solve the problem. I asked him why it was so cheap. He said: To build this thatched house, the masses provided labor and some materials for free, so including adding a kitchen, it would cost a total of 500 yuan. The teacher is semi-voluntary, the tuition is very low, and the poor are free. With 500 yuan, this class can be added. I think this method is very good. Students in small towns far from the city can both supplement their education and participate in local labor, and it is easy to popularize, and it is worth promoting and praising.
        The Budding Era of Industry
    There are many people from Jingjiang who work as textile workers in the Changzhou and Wuxi areas. They all regret that their hometown does not have a factory. The Yulun Yarn Factory here was only opened in 1944. Initially, it only had 1,048 old spindles, which increased to 1,688 spindles in 1945. However, due to poor equipment, incomplete machinery, and the disconnection of front and back spinning, the yarn pulled per spindle was only 0.6 pounds, resulting in high costs and large expenditures. In the old society, this industrial prototype was difficult to maintain. After liberation, with the help of the government, it gradually expanded. It leased steel wire cars, roving frames, and 408 fine spinning spindles from the Dacheng Textile Factory, which I manage, bringing the total to 2,096, balancing the front and back spinning equipment. At the same time, it obtained conversion funds and added power equipment. After the public-private partnership in 1954, under the direct leadership of the public representative, the quality of cotton yarn rose from Grade D to Grade B, the unit output per spindle rose to 1.2 to 1.3 pounds, and the amount of cotton used has been reduced to around 383 jin. This achievement can be regarded as unprecedented in small factories using old machines. After this visit, I felt very satisfied. At the same time, I believe that Jingjiang now has 150,000 mu of cotton fields, and there are conditions for developing the textile industry locally. Of course, Jingjiang's industrial production can be said to be still in a budding state. The government is advocating setting up factories in raw material producing areas. In the future, on this basis, it will definitely be greatly developed. This is also the beginning of developing local industry, and I hope the government will strengthen cultivation.
      New Atmosphere After Agricultural Cooperativization
    This time, I mainly inspected the countryside and visited cooperative societies in many townships. The members all said in unison that the peasants have clearly understood that the elementary cooperatives are better than mutual aid teams, and the advanced cooperatives are better than the elementary cooperatives. Everyone is willing to abandon the land dividend system and strive to become advanced cooperatives. Even the very old mothers said this, and the facts have also proven this point. Farmers participating in advanced agricultural cooperatives already account for more than 93% of the total number of farmers in the county, elementary cooperatives account for only 5%, and individual households account for only a little over 1%.
    Everyone says that agricultural cooperatives are good. Where exactly are they good? In 1950, the total grain output was 187.95 million jin. In 1955, it increased to 249.29 million jin, an increase of 33% compared to 1950. They said that in the past, Jingjiang's per mu yield was at most over 400 jin per year, and generally 2-300 jin. In the event of a disaster, it would be reduced even more. Things are very different after cooperativization. The production targets set by the peasant masses are mostly 800 jin per mu per year, and they want to strive for 1,000 jin. In the past, each mu of cotton field only yielded 30-40 jin of ginned cotton, but now they want to harvest 70-80 jin, and they want to strive for 100 jin. The land is still so big, but the yield can generally be increased by more than doubled. The year before last was a major flood, and everyone weathered it steadily. Last year was a bumper harvest, and the effect of increased production has already been received.
    The peasants all have such confidence that with two years of hard work, they can generally accumulate a year's surplus grain. With enough surplus grain, they can have enough food and clothing, and everything will be easy to handle. This wish can be achieved.
    While increasing production, the political awareness of the peasants has been raised. They generally understand that increasing production is for themselves and for socialism. Socialism is their only beautiful vision and happy future.
    The development of the rural literacy campaign is also amazing. Taking the Bawei District as an example, there are a total of 2,662 illiterate and semi-literate people between the ages of fifteen and fifty in the entire district, and 2,423 have enrolled, reaching over 90%.
        Some Insights After the Inspection
    I should also talk about some of my experiences after the inspection. I would like to borrow two sentences from the ancients: "Year after year the flowers are similar, year after year the people are different." Indeed, all the changes are due to the fact that the "people" are different. To put it more bluntly, it is not that the people are different, but that the people's ideological consciousness is different. What I saw and heard, from the county to the township level cadres, their spirit of hard work, perseverance, and sincere service to the people is consistent. Therefore, the masses are also different. Taking the industrial and commercial circles as an example, their running around to transport goods to the countryside is not only to open up business for themselves, but mainly to meet rural needs, and more importantly, to save farmers time to go to market, so that they can increase labor productivity. As for the peasants, they participate in cooperative societies, and they are willing to give up the land dividend system and transition from elementary cooperatives to advanced cooperatives. Of course, this is because the facts have proven that agricultural production after cooperativization has been greatly improved, material life is guaranteed, and they can have enough food and clothing. At the same time, they also realize that increased production is not only good for themselves, but also good for the country and the masses. They understand that socialism is good for everyone, even for future generations, so their awareness is higher. In particular, Jingjiang used to be too bitter, so now it seems even better. As for teachers, they not only target school-age children, but also regard literacy as their responsibility. All of this shows that everyone's vision has been broadened, so the entire place is no longer the closed hometown of the past, which powerfully proves the greatness of the Communist Party. Before the inspection, I always thought that the ancient system of small-scale peasant economy was not easy to transform, that it was scattered and backward, that there were many people, that it was not easy to educate, that literacy was even more difficult to achieve quickly, and that the transformation of the industrial and commercial circles in counties and towns must be worse and slower than in big cities. I now know that this estimate is completely wrong, and I only feel that I am lagging behind them, and I have come to realize that our practice is not enough after all, and conservative thinking is still at work.
    After the end of my inspection, I have only one concern: a small number of farm households, mostly old, mostly young, and mostly weak, lack labor force in their families. Although the outline for agricultural development has already stipulated special care measures, in the system of distribution according to work, they will ultimately get less if they work less. I still think that there should be appropriate measures tailored to local conditions to clearly stipulate how to solve the lives of such farm households.

    岁岁年年人不同
    全国人民代表大会代表常州纺织印染工业公司经理  刘国钧
    我在1956年4月15日由常州出发赴苏北靖江视察，共历时十日。视察地区，因时间关系，只限于靖江县范围。所到之地，除同地方首长和地方人士、农业社社长、工厂厂长等个别接触之外，总共参加了三次大会和四次座谈会，主要的是倾听各方面的汇报。我是靖江人，对于故乡情况，应该说是不十分生疏的，可是这次所看到和听到的，几乎无一不使我感到兴奋，出乎我意想之外。因此，这次视察，对我个人来说，也是受了一次现实的教育。
          解放前的情况
    靖江过去的情况是这样的：全县人口有四十多万，而土地连屋基坟基不生产的在内只有六十余万亩，平均每人不到一亩半地，事实上真正劳动农民连这一点也没有的，大部分土地集中在少数地主、富农的手里。以生产量来说，只有沿江的“沙田”，可以插水稻，生产量较高。而大部分土地产量很低。所以一般农民住的是草屋，喝的是麦糊，除少数地主、富农之外，大米饭是很少能吃得起的。
    靖江以前一向没有工业，连小手工业也不发达，农业生产又这样低落，人民当然困苦，商业也就谈不上，教育就不可能发展。
    我所知道的故乡，是闭塞和贫困的，而特别是在经过敌人破坏和反动统治长期压榨之后，满眼的疮痍，显出衰零败落景象，在我以前的印象中，只有一个“惨”字，概括了一切。
    现在依靠了党政的领导，生产增加，整个县镇都变了样。
    这次我所接触到的故乡，真像古人所说：“城郭依然，人事皆非”，这人事皆非，是要作新的解释，并不是说都换了一批人，而是所见到的父老兄弟从外貌到内心的表现，都换了一个样。衣服都穿得整齐了，面上也透露着红光了。年老的不再唉声叹气，年壮的都急急忙忙地赶工作，年小的都有机会就学。他们的幸运比我幼年时好多了，我仔细看街道上虽没有什么大更改，却添了不少东西，靖江城和生祠镇都有了电灯，有了人民银行，有了新华书店，其他旧有商店虽还是几张老招牌，但是内容不同了，他们有了百货公司的供应而货物充足了，他们懂得为消费者服务的道理，组织送货下乡。连中药铺也是这样。我所认识的生祠堂一家古老药店，碰到一张药方缺少了一味药材，情愿赶到三里路外的同业中去配齐，再送到病人家里，我问了这张药方，价值只有两角八分，而借药送药却来回赶了十八里路。我问他为了这笔小买卖，忙了大半天，不是得不偿失吗？他说：能够配合齐全，及时为病家服务，是十分感得愉快的。这种情况，在解放前我是从来没有看到过。
    靖江全县解放前小学学额只有二万五千人，解放后逐年增加，到1955年已有四万二千五百人，增加了一倍。初中原有一所，从二百多名学生到四百人左右，现在有了三个初中，已有二千三百多名学生了。
    这里还值得提到一件事，靖江东门外孤山区团结乡一位教师，盛应北先生，他在这个乡里办了一个初中补习班，成绩很好，群众要求他添办一班，可是没有课室，照他预计只需四百元就可解决问题。我问他何以这样便宜，他说：造这个草房子，群众出劳动又出了一部分材料不要钱，所以连添造一个厨房，共需要五百元。教师是半义务，学费收得很少，贫者免费，有五百元这个班次就可添设起来了。我认为这种方法很好，离市较远的小乡镇学生，一面可以补习文化，一面也可以参加当地的劳动，而且容易普及，是值得提倡和表扬的。
        萌芽时代的工业
    靖江人在常州无锡一带，做纺织工人的特别多，他们都以自己家乡没有一个工厂引为憾事。这里的裕纶纱厂是在1944年才开办，初时只有一千零四十八枚旧锭，至1945年始增至一千六百八十八锭，但因设备差，机器不全，前后纺脱节，锭扯出数只有零点六磅，因而成本高，开支大，在旧社会里，这一个工业雏形，也是很难维持的。解放后，得到政府的帮助，逐渐扩展，向我主持的大成纺织厂租用了钢丝车、粗纱车和细纱锭四百零八枚，连前共有了二千零九十六枚，平衡了前后纺设备，同时获得了转业资金，添置了原动设备，1954年公私合营后，在公方代表的直接领导下，棉纱质量由丁级升到乙级，单位产量锭扯已经升到一磅二、三，用棉量已降到三百八十三斤左右。这个成绩，在利用旧机器的小型厂中，可算得是空前的了。我这次参观之后，觉得很满意，同时我认为靖江现在已有十五万亩棉田，就地发展纺织业，是有条件的。当然，靖江的工业生产，可以说还处在萌芽状态，政府正倡导在原料产地设厂，将来在这个基础上，必定可以大大发展，这也是发展地方工业的一个开始，希望政府加强培养。
      农业合作化后的新气象
    我这次主要是视察农村，访问了很多乡的合作社，社员们都异口同声说，农民们已经明确了初级社比互助组好，高级社又比初级社好，大家愿意放弃土地分红制，争取转成高级社。虽是老态龙钟的老妈妈也都这样说，而事实也证明了这一点，参加高级合作社的农民已经占全县农民总数的93％以上，初级合作社只占5％，单干户只有百分之一点多了。
    大家说农业合作社好，究竟好在什么地方呢？1950年粮食总产量一万八千七百九十五万斤，1955年增加到二万四千九百二十九万斤，比1950年增加了33％。他们说靖江以前每亩田全年收获至多在四百斤以上，一般是二、三百斤，如遇灾害，就更要减少。合作化后就大大不同了。农民群众所订的生产指标，全年多是每亩八百斤，且要争取一千斤。棉田以前每亩皮棉只收三、四十斤，现在要收七、八十斤，而且要争取一百斤。土地还是这么大，而产量普遍可能增加一倍以上。前年是大水灾，大家也稳度过了。去年是丰收，已经收到了增产的效果。
    农民们都抱着这样的信心，两年努力，可以普遍积存一年余粮，有了足够的余粮，就可以丰衣足食，一切都好办了。这个愿望是能够达到的。
    在增产的同时，农民政治觉悟提高了，他们普遍懂得增产为了自己，也为了社会主义，社会主义是他们唯一的美丽远景和幸福的前途。
    农村扫盲运动的开展，也是惊人的。以八圩区一个地方为例，全区十五岁到五十岁的文盲和半文盲共有二千六百六十二人，入学的就有二千四百二十三人，达90％以上。
        视察后的一点体会
    还应该谈一点我视察后的体会。我想借古人两句话：“年年岁岁花相似，岁岁年年人不同”。的确，一切的改变，是由于“人”是不同了，说得更透彻一些，不是人不同，而是人的思想意识不同了。我所看到和听到的，从县到乡各级干部，他们刻苦耐劳、真心实意地为人民服务的精神是一贯的。因而群众也就不同了。以工商界来说，他们东奔西走，运货下乡已不仅是为了自己业务打开出路，而主要是为满足农村需要，更主要是为农民节约上市的时间，让他们增加劳动生产力。以农民来说，他们参加合作社，愿意放弃土地分红制，由低级社转为高级社，固然由于事实证明合作化后的农业生产就大大提高，物质生活有保障，可以丰衣足食；同时，他们也认识到提高了生产，不仅仅对自己有好处，而且对国家对大众都有好处，懂得社会主义是大家好，连后代子孙都好，因而觉悟更高了。特别是靖江原来是太苦，现在就显得更好。以教师来说，不仅以学龄儿童为对象，而且把扫盲也作为自己的责任，这一切一切说明了每个人的眼光都放大了，因而整个地方也不是过去闭塞的故乡了，这就有力的证明了共产党的伟大。我在未视察之前，总以为小农经济的古老制度是不易改造，分散落后，人口众多，是不易教育的，扫盲更是难见速效，就是县镇上的工商界改造也一定要比大城市差些，进步慢些，那知道这种估计是完全错误，只感觉我自己反而跟不上他们，从而体会到我们的实践究竟不够，保守思想还是在作祟。
    我视察结束之后，思想只有一点顾虑：少数农户，老的多、小的多、弱的多，一家之中劳动力缺少，虽然农业发展纲要里已经规定有特别照顾的办法，但是在按劳取酬的制度里，终究是少劳少得，对于这种农户的生活如何解决，我还以为应该有因地制宜的适当办法来明确规定。
