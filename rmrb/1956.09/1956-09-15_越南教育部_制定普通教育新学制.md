    Vietnam's Ministry of Education
    Formulates a New General Education System
    Hanoi News: The Ministry of Education of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has formulated a new general education system, which will be implemented in northern Vietnam starting from the new academic year on September 20th this year. The main contents of the new system are as follows: (1) General education will implement a continuous ten-year system, including three stages: The first stage is from first grade to fourth grade (excluding kindergarten), equivalent to primary school. The second stage is from fifth grade to seventh grade, equivalent to junior high school. The third stage is from eighth grade to tenth grade, equivalent to senior high school.
  (2) Each academic year is nine months long, starting in September and ending at the end of May of the following year. The summer vacation is three months long. Each academic year of nine months is divided into four semesters. At the beginning of each autumn semester, students can take ten days off to participate in autumn harvest work. (3) Because the curriculum for each grade level is designed according to the general psychological and physiological development of students, the new system also stipulates the age of admission for students. Students in the first grade must be no younger than seven years old or older than eleven years old. However, the admission age for female students can be extended by one year, and the admission age for ethnic minority students can be extended by two years.
    During the French rule, the Vietnamese education system divided schools into three stages that were not interconnected: elementary primary schools, advanced primary schools, and secondary schools. From 1950 onwards, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam implemented educational system reforms in the liberated areas, changing the original system to a three-stage, nine-year continuous general education system. The first stage was four years, equivalent to advanced primary school; the second stage was three years, equivalent to junior high school; and the third stage was two years, equivalent to senior high school. In the two years since the restoration of peace, in addition to this general education system, the old education system also existed simultaneously in the newly liberated areas. This educational system reform will unify these two systems and extend the length of general education by one year, while also improving the teaching content. The purpose of doing so is to improve the quality of teaching so that the talents cultivated can better adapt to the needs of national construction.

    越南教育部
    制定普通教育新学制
    本报讯：河内消息：越南民主共和国教育部已经制定了一个普通教育新学制，这个学制将从今年9月20日开始的新学年起在越南北部予以执行。新学制的主要内容有以下几点：（一）普通教育实行十年一贯制，包括三个阶段：第一阶段从一年级到四年级（不包括幼儿班），相当于小学。第二阶段从五年级到七年级，相当于初中。第三阶段从八年级到十年级，相当于高中。
  （二）每一学年共九个月，九月间开学，第二年五月底放假。暑假期共三个月。在每学年的九个月中又分为四个学期。每年秋季开始时，学生可以请假十天，以便参加秋收工作。（三）由于每一年级的课程都是根据学生的心理和生理发展的一般状况而设立的，新学制对于学生入学的年龄也作了规定。一年级的学生不得小于七岁或大于十一岁。但是女学生的入学年龄可以延长一年，少数民族学生可以延长两年。
    在法国统治时代，越南的教育制度是把学校分为互不联贯的初级小学、高级小学和中学三个阶段。从1950年起，越南民主共和国政府在解放区实行了学制改革，将原来的学制改为三阶段、九年一贯制的普通教育学制。即第一阶段四年，相当于高级小学；第二阶段三年，相当于初级中学；第三阶段二年，相当于高级中学。和平恢复后的两年来，除了这个普通教育体系外，在新解放区还同时存在着旧的教育体系。这次学制改革将把这两种体系统一起来，同时还将普通教育的年限延长了一年，教学内容也有改进。这样做的目的是为了提高教学的质量，以便培养出来的人材更能适应国家建设的需要。
