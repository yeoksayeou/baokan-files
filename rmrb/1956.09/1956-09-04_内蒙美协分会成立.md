    Inner Mongolia Artists Association Branch Established
    (Our newspaper dispatch) The Inner Mongolia Branch of the Chinese Artists Association has been established. In the past few years, art work in Inner Mongolia has developed rapidly. There are more than one hundred painters and art workers from Mongolian, Han, Manchu, Solon, and Daur ethnic groups, who have created many excellent works. The establishment of the Inner Mongolia Artists Association Branch will play a significant role in expanding the ranks of art workers in Inner Mongolia, strengthening unity within the art community, and promoting artistic creation.
