Xinhua News Agency, 4th. Xinhua News Agency reporter interviewed the person in charge of the State Council's Sixth Office on September 3rd, regarding how to solve the problem of transportation tension in some areas. The person in charge, when meeting with the reporter, expressed deep concern for the people in some areas whose lives have been affected by the transportation tension.

The person in charge said that on August 31st, the Sixth Office of the State Council had already issued a notice to the transportation and other relevant departments. The notice pointed out that the transportation departments should not only pay sufficient attention to the current transportation tension but also anticipate that the Mid-Autumn Festival and National Day are approaching, and the supply of festival goods and passenger transport will inevitably be busier. Therefore, the transportation departments and relevant material transportation departments, as well as the relevant provinces and cities, should jointly consult and quickly take effective measures to try their best to solve the problem.

According to the reporter's understanding from the Ministry of Railways and the Ministry of Communications, the Ministry of Railways is taking emergency measures to solve the transportation congestion in the western section of the Longhai Railway. On September 1st and September 3rd, the Ministry of Railways has already invited the heads of transportation in Gansu, Xinjiang, and Qinghai provinces and related units to a meeting to study and determine to temporarily stop the technical transformation project between Baoji and Lanzhou on the Longhai Railway recently, and add several temporary passenger trains and freight trains every day, so as to transport passengers stranded along the line and goods accumulated along the line to Lanzhou in the short term. On other lines, some temporary passenger trains will also be added recently, first transporting passengers such as students about to start school, technicians and workers' families, and immigrants, and rushing to transport important materials. The Ministry of Railways has also formulated technical measures to strengthen the passing capacity of lines and stations and strengthen unloading, and sent work teams to difficult areas to mobilize employees to implement these measures.

The Ministry of Communications has sent a working group to Shanghai, Hankou and other ports to inspect work, and issued instructions to its subordinate shipping administrations, requiring them to take active measures to remove and strictly prevent the accumulation of materials in ports, add stevedores in various ports, strengthen the throughput capacity of major ports, and add some barges. The Highway Administration of the Ministry of Communications is preparing to take three major reforms in business management recently: First, to run driver training classes to train a large number of automobile drivers in order to promote two-shift or three-shift systems in various places. Second, if the supply of steel allows, it is planned to manufacture a batch of automobile trailers. A car with a trailer can carry several more tons of cargo. If most cars can tow trailers, a lot more cargo can be carried. Third, reduce the car repair rate and shorten the car repair time.

In addition to taking various emergency measures, the relevant departments will further study solutions to fundamentally reverse the tense transportation situation.

    铁道部和交通部等有关部门采取紧急措施
    改进内地运输堵塞情况
    新华社4日讯　新华社记者就如何解决某些地区交通运输紧张的问题，九月三日访问了国务院第六办公室负责人。这位负责人在接见记者的时候，对于某些地区因为交通紧张而使生活受影响的人民，表示十分关切。
    这位负责人说，8月31日，国务院第六办公室已经向交通运输和其他有关部门发出通知。通知中指出，交通运输部门不仅要对当前运输紧张的情况应该引起足够的重视，而且还应当预见到：中秋节和国庆节快到了，过节供应的物资和旅客运输，都势必更加繁忙。因此，交通运输部门和有关的物资运输部门，以及有关的省、市，应当共同协商，迅速采取有效措施，尽力设法解决。
    据记者从铁道部和交通部方面了解，铁道部正在采取紧急措施解决陇海路西段运输堵塞问题。9月1日和9月3日，铁道部已经邀请了甘肃、新疆、青海省交通运输方面的负责人和各有关单位开会研究，确定准备在最近暂时停止陇海路宝鸡到兰州间的技术改造工程，每天加开若干列临时旅客列车和货物列车，以便在短期内先把阻滞在沿线的旅客和积压在沿线的货物运往兰州。在其他线路上，最近也要多加开一些临时旅客列车，首先输送即将开学的学生、技术工人和工人家属，以及移民等旅客，并且抢运重要物资。铁道部还拟定了加强线路和车站通过能力及加强卸车的技术措施，并且派工作团到困难地区动员职工实现这些措施。
    交通部已经派出工作组往上海、汉口等港检查工作，并且向所属各航运管理局发出指示，要求采取积极措施，解除和严防港口积压物资，增添各港口的装卸工人，加强主要港口吞吐能力，并且添置一部分驳船。交通部公路总局最近准备在经营管理方面采取三项重大改革：一、开办司机训练班，培养大批汽车司机，以便在各地推行两班制或三班制。二、如果钢材供应情况允许，准备制造一批汽车拖斗。汽车带一个拖斗，可以多拉几吨货物。如果大多数汽车都能拖带拖斗，就可以多拉不少货物。三、降低汽车修理率，缩短汽车修理时间。
    各有关部门除了采取各种紧急措施以外，还将进一步研究从根本上扭转运输紧张局面的方案。
