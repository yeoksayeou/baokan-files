    Yakutsk's Diamonds
    In the boundless forests of the Yakut Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic in eastern Soviet Union, several small villages have emerged. Emerald green forests surround rows of small wooden houses, the residences of Soviet geologists who have discovered very rich diamond mines in this area.
    When diamonds are mentioned, people are accustomed to viewing them as exceptionally luxurious ornaments, readily conjuring up images of beautiful diamond rings and the like, which are extraordinarily expensive. In fact, diamonds also have a very wide range of applications in industrial technology, from cutting glass to metal processing, drilling hard rock, and grinding hard materials into finished products. They are also indispensable in the manufacture of the most precise instruments and chronometers.
    Diamonds are a rare mineral. In 1954, the year with the highest global diamond production, only a little over four tons were mined worldwide, of which 82% were used in industrial technology. The place with the most diamond production is Africa, accounting for 98% of the world's output (excluding the Soviet Union), followed by Brazil, Australia, and India. In the past, many people believed that this mineral was only found in the tropics. However, the short list of diamond-producing regions has now added the Yakut Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic in the Soviet Union.
    The discovery of Yakutsk's diamond deposits was neither accidental nor easy. Soviet geologists determined based on geological structure that this region in eastern Siberia must have diamonds. However, arduous exploration work went on for a long time. The footprints of geologists could be found almost everywhere, from the coast of the Arctic Ocean along the uninhabited rivers, in the vast areas covered with forests. They did not miss a single small river, and in order to find a few small diamond crystals, they often had to wash tens or hundreds of cubic meters of gravel, and sometimes they could not even find a single small diamond!
    However, scientific foresight and perseverance finally triumphed. In 1949, a team in the exploration party found the first diamond in Yakutsk. Some time later, they discovered a "partner" of Yakutsk diamonds – deep red pyrope garnet. These small red stones were mixed with the diamond ore, but were tens of thousands of times more abundant than diamonds. This discovery was almost as important as finding diamonds, because these small red stones acted like guide lights, indicating the direction of diamonds. So the geologists followed the small red stones and traveled between valleys with streams and springs… Finally, in the autumn of 1954, they discovered the Soviet Union's first diamond mine. Subsequently, in 1955, dozens of diamond-producing areas were discovered one after another.
    Nature hid the diamonds deep in the forest, hundreds of kilometers away from the nearest settlement. The exploration team had to frequent the deserted forests. How excited these people who were searching for treasure in the mountains were when they found diamonds! An interesting "story" happened when a small exploration team found the first diamond. The diameter of this diamond was only three millimeters and weighed twenty milligrams, but what joy this small first gemstone brought to people! People crowded into a small room to admire this dazzling gemstone. Suddenly, the person holding the small diamond dropped it, and it could not be found no matter what. There was no other way, and they finally decided to burn down the small house, then sift through the ashes and soil to find this first treasured gemstone. So, people carefully shook their clothes again, took off their shoes to check, so as not to bring the diamond outside, because even if they burned down the house, they would not be able to find it. After searching for another hour, a joyous shout suddenly came from the crowd. It turned out that the small diamond had somehow fallen into a geologist's rubber shoe.
    Yakutsk's diamond mines are constantly being discovered under people's enthusiastic efforts. The mineral deposits are very rich and distributed over a vast area of ​​thousands of square kilometers. The mining volume in the next few years can greatly exceed the domestic demand of the Soviet Union. In the future, in addition to diamonds required for industrial technology, diamonds for jewelry will also be mined in Yakutsk. The Sixth Five-Year Plan has decided to prepare for the establishment of a large diamond mining industry in Yakutsk. The first residential areas appearing in the virgin forests, although temporarily just tents and small prefabricated houses, will soon be replaced by tall buildings, docks will be built on the riverbanks, roads will run through the forests, and airports and power plants will be built… In short, this will become a large industrial area in the Soviet Union with the reputation of a "diamond capital."

    雅库特的金刚石
    在苏联东部雅库特自治共和国的无边无际的大森林里，出现了几个不大的村庄，碧绿色的森林围绕着一排排的小木房子，这是苏联地质工作者居住的地方，他们在这一带发现了非常富饶的金刚石矿。
    提起金刚石，人们总是习惯于把它看做是一种异常豪华的装饰品，很容易想起那贵得惊人的美丽的钻石戒指等等。其实，金刚石在工业技术上的应用也是非常广泛的，从切玻璃开始，一直到金属加工、钻探坚硬的岩石、研磨坚硬材料的制成品，都用得着它，在制造最精密的仪器和计时表时，也是缺不了金刚石的。
    金刚石是一种稀有的矿物，1954年全世界金刚石的开采量是最多的一年，也只有四吨多，其中82％都用在了工业技术上。产金刚石最多的地方是非洲，它的产量占全世界产量的98％（苏联不算在内），其次是巴西、澳大利亚和印度等地。过去许多人认为这种矿石只是热带的产物，可是现在，这个不长的金刚石产地名单上又添上了苏联的雅库特自治共和国。
    雅库特金刚石矿藏的发现并不是偶然的，也不是容易的。苏联地质学家根据地质结构断定西伯利亚东部的这个地区一定有金刚石。可是艰苦的勘探工作进行了很久。差不多在从北冰洋海岸起沿着那漫无人烟的一条条河流，在那布满了森林的广大地区，都找得到地质工作者的足迹。他们没有放过一条小河，为了找到几小颗金刚石结晶体，常常要淘洗几十或几百立方公尺的沙砾，而且有时还连一小颗金刚石都找不到！
    但是，科学的预见和坚持精神终于胜利了。1949年，勘探队中的一支队伍在雅库特找到了第一颗金刚石。又过了一些时候，发现了雅库特金刚石有一个“伙伴”——深红色的镁铝榴石。这种小红石和金刚石矿混在一起，可是比金刚石多好几万倍，这个发现简直不亚于找到金刚石，因为这些小红石就像指路的小灯一样，指出了金刚石的动向。于是地质工作者们就跟着小红石辗转在有小溪和泉水流过的山谷之间……最后，终于在1954年秋天发现了苏联第一个金刚石矿。随后，1955年又相继发现了几十个金刚石矿产地。
    大自然把金刚石藏在大森林的深处，离最近的居民点也有几百公里，勘探队不得不经常出没在渺无人迹的大森林里。这些在深山探宝的人们，每当找到金刚石时是多么兴奋啊！有一支小勘探队在找到了第一颗金刚石时，曾发生了这样一个有趣的“故事”。这颗金刚石的直径不过只有三毫米，重二十毫克，可是这小小的第一颗宝石给人们带来了怎样的喜悦啊！人们挤到一间小屋里来欣赏这枚光彩夺目的宝石。忽然那个拿着小金刚石的人一失手把它丢掉了，无论如何再也找不到了。大家没有办法，最后决定要把这间小屋烧掉，然后淘选灰烬和土，一定要把这第一颗珍爱的宝石找出来。于是人们再一次仔细地抖一抖衣服，脱掉鞋子看一看，免得把金刚石带到屋外去，因为那样即使把屋子烧掉也找不到它了。又寻找了一小时的样子，人群中突然发出了愉快的喊声，原来这颗小金刚石不知怎么竟掉到一个地质工作者的胶皮鞋中了。
    雅库特的金刚石矿就这样在人们的热情努力下不断得到新的发现。矿藏是很丰富的，它分布在面积达数千平方公里的广大土地上。最近几年内的开采量就可以大大超过苏联本国的需求。将来，除去工业技术必须的金刚石外，在雅库特也要开采做首饰用的钻石。第六个五年计划已决定在雅库特为建立庞大的金刚石开采工业做好准备工作。原始大森林中出现的第一批居住区，虽然暂时还是一些帐篷和不大的装配式房屋，但是不久这儿就会盖起高大的房屋，河岸上会建起码头，大森林里会有汽车路穿过，飞机场和发电厂也要建筑起来……一句话，这儿要成为苏联一个有“金刚石之都”的声誉的大工业区。
