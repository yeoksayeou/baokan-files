    Unrealistic Pig Raising Plan

    In order to develop pig farming, Zhangjiakou Prefecture, Hebei Province, held a meeting in July to make arrangements. The special commissioner's office assigned the task of raising pigs to Kangbao County, which was to have every three households raise a sow capable of breeding piglets. The county implemented the commissioner's office plan in the same way. This is where the problem arises. The county has more than 32,000 households, and if every three households are to raise one sow, a total of more than 10,600 sows would need to be raised; if each sow is planned to have two litters of piglets per year, with each litter having ten piglets, more than 212,000 piglets would be born. Including the sows, each household would have to raise seven pigs per year. How can such a plan be completed? Currently, the entire county only has more than 2,800 sows! To raise so many pigs, the problems of feed shortage and insufficient equipment are also difficult to solve. This is truly a subjectivist plan! Huangshan

    没法实现的养猪计划
    河北省张家口地区为了发展饲猪业，在七月份开会作了布置。专署分配给康保县的养猪任务是每三户养一口可以繁殖小猪的母猪。专署的计划县里是照样向下布置的。这样，问题就来了。全县三万二千余户，每三户要养一只母猪，共计要养一万零六百余只；每只母猪每年计划生二窝小猪，每窝按十只计算，要生二十一万二千多只小猪，连母猪计算在内，每户全年要养七只猪。这样的计划怎么能完成呢？现在全县才有二千八百多只母猪啊！要养这么多猪，饲料缺乏、设备不够的问题也不好解决。这真是个主观主义的计划！　荒山
