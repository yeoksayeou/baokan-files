    Exploring the Water Source Deep in the Cave
    Chénxī
    During the drought resistance struggle in Hengshan County, Hunan Province, the following story has been widely circulated:
    Since the beginning of summer, the First Agricultural Cooperative of Yuantou Township, Hengshan County, has suffered a severe drought. The cooperative's more than 1,200 mu of rice paddies relied solely on 41 ponds, 9 dams, and small springs for irrigation. By July 2nd, the water in the dams and ponds was almost exhausted. About 700 mu of rice seedlings were withering, and some had already died. The cooperative members searched for water sources everywhere, but without success. People were becoming pessimistic. An elderly member, Tan Jinyun, said, "I think we should pray to the Water God!" The young leader of the drought resistance shock team, Tan Qiugou, thought: Pessimism, despair, praying to the Water God – isn't that just waiting for the rice fields to dry up? He held a meeting with the team members to discuss ways to fight the drought and find water. But the members sighed and groaned. Some said they had searched everywhere, asking if they were supposed to look to the sky. At that moment, Tan Qiugou suddenly had an idea, saying, "There's a legend that a dragon used to come out of Yuhu Rock. I wonder if there's any water inside?" This sparked everyone's interest. After much discussion, they decided to go into Yuhu Rock to find water.
    Everyone knew about Yuhu Rock. It was in Yuantou Village, connected to the mountains. This huge rock formation looked like a large teapot, so it was called Yuhu Rock (Jade Teapot Rock). There was a sloping cave on the mountainside that no one had ever entered, with tales of a dragon inside, or a snake spirit, and many other frightening legends. But the young drought resistance shock team members were not intimidated by these superstitious stories. On a scorching hot morning, Tan Qiugou and several Youth League members put on cotton clothes, lit torches, and set off into the cave. As soon as they entered the cave entrance, a damp, eerie chill struck them. As they went deeper, it was pitch black, winding, uneven, and full of pits and bumps. They were constantly stubbing their toes and hitting their heads. The further they went, the thinner the air became, and the dimmer the light. After about forty meters, they still hadn't found water. Some hesitated, not wanting to go any further. Tan Qiugou, who was at the front, thought: This isn't the end. If we haven't found water, how can we go back? The withered rice seedlings in the fields appeared before his eyes... So he shouted, "Keep going!" and led everyone deeper into the darkness. There was no light at all, and the ground was getting slipperier and slipperier, like walking on melon rinds. About 200 meters from the cave entrance, some people wavered, asking, "Can we keep going?" Tan Qiugou replied from the front, "To the end!" As they approached another cave, they saw a white expanse in front of them. It turned out there was water there! Everyone was so happy they wanted to jump for joy. How much water was in this large cave? They couldn't tell with flashlights and torches. Tan Qiugou took off his clothes and went into the bone-chilling water to explore. Even just at the edge, it was about five feet deep.
    When the cooperative members heard the good news, they cheered. The next day, the cooperative sent fifty laborers to dig a more than half-li long channel in the cave. On the third day, they installed eighteen water wheels. People lit carbide lamps and kerosene lamps to draw water into the fields. The cooperative members sang as they treaded the water wheels. When the gushing spring water flowed out of the cave, a burst of cheers echoed outside the cave. People from eight or nine li around came to see. A 78-year-old cooperative member, Hu Fuqing, said, "Since the beginning of time, I've never heard of getting water from here. Now, with the leadership of the Communist Party, anything is possible!"

    山洞深处探水源
    晨曦
    在湖南衡山县的抗旱斗争中，到处流传着这样一个故事：
    入夏以后，衡山县源头乡第一农业社遭受了严重的旱灾。全社一千二百多亩水稻只靠四十一口塘、九座坝和小股泉水灌溉。7月2日，坝水塘水快被车干了，眼看七百亩稻田的禾苗枯黄了，有些已经枯死了。社员们东奔西走找水源，总也没有找到。人们都有些悲观了。老年社员谭金云说：“我看还是求求水仙老爷吧！”青年抗旱突击队长谭秋苟心里想：悲观失望，求水仙，这不是眼睁睁地等着稻田枯干吗？他就和队员们开会，研究抗旱找水源的办法。但是，队员们都长吁短叹，有的说都找遍了，莫非还要上天去找不成？这时，谭秋苟忽然灵机一动说：“有个传说，说玉壶岩原先出过一条龙，不知里面是否有水？”这样一说，把大家提醒了。你一言我一语，议论纷纷，他们最后决定进玉壶岩去找水源。
    提起玉壶岩，这里没人不知道。它在群山相联的源头村，这座巨大的山岩，形状很像一把大茶壶，所以被称为玉壶岩。山腰有个倾斜的大山洞，从来没有人进去过，说是里面有条龙，又说是蛇精，还有不少别的令人可怕的传说。青年抗旱突击队员们可没有被这些迷信的传说所吓倒。谭秋苟带上了几个青年团员在热得火辣辣的一天上午，披上棉衣，打上火把就朝洞内出发了。刚进洞口，迎面扑来一阵阴森森的潮气。再往里走，黑洞洞的，弯弯曲曲、坑坑凹凹、不是踢痛了脚趾，就是碰着了头。越往里走，空气越稀薄，光线越暗淡。他们走到约有四十公尺深的地方，还是没有水。大家有些犹豫，不想再前进了。走在最前面的谭秋苟想：这里又不是尽头，没找到水，怎能往回走呢？田里枯干的禾苗又在他眼前出现了……于是他喊了声“继续前进！”就带着大家又向里面摸索着走去了。光线完全没有了，脚下越走越滑，像踩在瓜皮上一样。走到离洞口二百公尺深的地方，有人动摇了，问：“还能走吗？”谭秋苟在前边回答说：“走到尽头！”当他们快接近另一个岩洞时，看到前边白茫茫的一片，原来这里有水！大家高兴得真想跳起来。这个大洞里究竟有多少水呢？用手电筒和火把照，是照不出来的。谭秋苟脱下衣服，下到刺骨的冷水里一探，仅仅边缘地方大概就有五尺多深。
    社员们听到喜讯，都欢腾起来了。第二天，合作社派了五十个劳动力，在山洞里挖了一条半里多长的渠道，第三天，安上了十八部水车，人们打着汽灯，煤油灯，把水引到田里来。社员们一边车水一边唱。当滚滚的泉水从岩洞里涌出来的时候，洞口外面响起一阵欢呼，周围八、九里的人都来参观。一个七十八岁的老社员胡伏清说：“自从盘古开天辟地，从没听说从这还能取出水来；如今有了共产党的领导，什么也能办到！”
