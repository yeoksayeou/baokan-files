Welcome Athletes from Hong Kong and Macau to Beijing to Participate in the Selection Trials
Dong Shouyi
Member of the International Olympic Committee
Vice Chairman of the Chinese Olympic Committee

The 16th Olympic Games, which the world is watching with interest and the people of the whole country are deeply concerned about, will be held in Melbourne, Australia in late November this year. China will send a sports team composed of about one hundred outstanding male and female athletes to participate. At present, China's sports circles and athletes are doing everything possible to step up preparations in an effort to achieve good results at the Olympic Games. The Preparatory Committee for China's Participation in the 16th Olympic Games, in order to concentrate the most outstanding athletes in the country, decided to hold the selection trials for the Chinese Olympic Team in Beijing from October 7 to 16, and notified outstanding athletes from Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau to come to participate. This will be a grand review of China's sports teams.

Recently, someone asked me: The Hong Kong Olympic Committee is already a unit recognized by the International Olympic Committee and can send a team to participate in the International Olympic Games independently. Now we are notifying Chinese athletes from Hong Kong to come to Beijing to participate in the selection trials. Is this in line with the principles of the Olympic Charter? For those who are not familiar with the Olympic Charter and past related situations, this is indeed a question. Therefore, it is necessary to discuss this issue and related situations.

Article 38 of the Olympic Charter stipulates: "Athletes representing a country in the Olympic Games must be nationals of that country." This clearly shows that Chinese athletes living in Hong Kong, as long as they have not represented Hong Kong in the Olympic Games, are qualified, have the right, and are free to represent their motherland in the Olympic Games. Therefore, the Preparatory Committee for China's Participation in the 16th Olympic Games' notification to Hong Kong athletes to come to participate in the selection is fully in line with the spirit of the Olympic Charter.

Looking at the historical facts, Chinese athletes in Hong Kong have always been an integral part of our country's sports teams. They have participated in previous National Games and have been selected as members of the Chinese delegation to participate in the Far Eastern Games and the Olympic Games.

As early as 1910, at the First National Games held in Nanjing, Hong Kong athletes participated as representatives of South China and won the football championship trophy. At the same time, Hong Kong sports representatives Zhong Rongguang and others served on the organizing committee of the Games. At the Second National Games held in Beijing in 1914, Hong Kong sent tennis players to participate and won the men's singles championship and doubles runner-up. At the Third National Games held in Wuchang in 1924, Hong Kong also sent a delegation to participate and recommended Liu Fuzi as a consultant to the Games. At the Fourth National Games held in Hangzhou in 1930 (Note: Since the Fourth National Games, provinces, cities, and overseas Chinese have been used as units), Hong Kong, as a unit, selected a team of 65 male and female athletes to participate and won the baseball and swimming championships. At the Fifth National Games held in Nanjing in 1933, Hong Kong selected a team of more than 60 people to participate and won the swimming championship. At the Sixth National Games held in Shanghai in 1935, Hong Kong sent 79 male and female athletes to participate and won the football championship. At the Seventh National Games held in Shanghai in 1948, Hong Kong sent a large team of 105 male and female athletes to participate in many competitions, including men's track and field, swimming, football, volleyball, tennis, water polo, badminton, table tennis, and women's swimming, badminton, and table tennis. It can be seen that Chinese athletes in Hong Kong have always maintained close ties with the motherland's sports.

In addition, I remember that during the Far Eastern Games held from 1913 to 1934 (Note: The Far Eastern Games were held in China, Japan, and the Philippines in rotation for a total of ten sessions during this period), Hong Kong sent athletes to participate in the national selection trials each time. At that time, most of the football, volleyball, swimming, and tennis players were from Hong Kong. Li Luobo from Hong Kong participated in the Far Eastern Games twice as a member of the Chinese delegation and won four first places in swimming at the Second Far Eastern Games in 1915. Tennis player Wu Shiguang participated in the Far Eastern Games four times as a member of the Chinese delegation.

Chinese athletes in Hong Kong have also represented China in the Olympic Games many times. Before liberation, China participated in the Olympic Games three times, and the Chinese delegation to the Olympic Games included outstanding Hong Kong athletes. I remember very clearly that at the 11th Olympic Games held in Berlin in 1936, most of the football players in the Chinese delegation were from Hong Kong. Chinese athletes in Hong Kong have always had the sacred and glorious right to represent their motherland in international competitions; facts have proved that in many past international competitions, they have indeed won honor for the motherland.

Not long ago, the Preparatory Committee for China's Participation in the 16th Olympic Games received letters from Chinese athletes in Hong Kong and Macau, requesting to participate in the selection of the motherland's Olympic team. This ardent patriotic desire is entirely understandable. Now, the Preparatory Committee for China's Participation in the 16th Olympic Games is notifying them to come to participate in the selection trials for the Chinese Olympic team, which is in line with their wishes and meets their requirements.

I sincerely hope that athletes from Hong Kong and Macau will enthusiastically sign up to participate in the selection competitions for the Chinese Olympic team in order to strengthen the motherland's sports teams and win glory for the country. Finally, I would like to extend a warm welcome to the athletes from Hong Kong and Macau who are about to come to Beijing to participate in the selection trials! I express my respect for their spirit of loving the motherland!

    欢迎港、澳运动员来京参加选拔赛
    国际奥林匹克委员会委员
    中国奥林匹克委员会副主席  董守义
    举世瞩目和全国人民热切关怀的第十六届奥林匹克运动会，今年11月下旬将在澳大利亚的墨尔本举行。中国将派出一个由一百名左右的男、女优秀运动员所组成的运动队伍，前往参加。目前，我国体育界和运动员们正尽一切力量在加紧准备着，争取在奥林匹克运动会上获得良好成绩。我国参加第十六届奥林匹克运动会筹备委员会，为了集中全国最优秀的运动选手，决定从10月7日到16日，在北京举行中国奥林匹克运动队的选拔赛，并通知台湾和香港、澳门的优秀运动员前来参加，这将是一次我国体育运动队伍的盛大检阅。
    最近有人问我：香港奥林匹克委员会已是国际奥林匹克委员会所承认的一个单位，它可以单独派队参加国际奥林匹克运动会，现在我们通知香港的中国运动员来北京参加选拔赛，是不是符合奥林匹克运动会宪章的原则呢？对于不熟悉奥林匹克运动会宪章和过去的有关情况的人，这确是一个问题。所以，就有必要把这个问题和有关情况谈一谈。
    奥林匹克运动会宪章第三十八条规定：“代表一国参加奥林匹克运动会的选手必须为该国国民”。这就可以清楚地看出，住在香港的中国运动员，只要没有代表香港参加过奥林匹克运动会，就有资格、有权利、有自由代表祖国参加奥林匹克运动会。因此，中国参加第十六届奥林匹克运动会筹备委员会通知香港运动员前来参加选拔，是完全符合奥林匹克运动会宪章的精神的。
    再从过去的历史事实来看，在香港的中国运动员，从来就是我国运动员队伍的组成部分之一。他们曾参加了历届的全国运动会，也曾被选拔为中国代表队的成员，参加过远东运动会和奥林匹克运动会。
    远在1910年，在南京举行的第一届全国运动会上，香港运动员曾作为华南区的代表参加了这次大会，并获得了足球冠军锦标，同时，香港体育界代表钟荣光等四人还担任了大会的筹备委员会的工作；1914年在北京举行的第二届全国运动会上，香港又派了网球运动员参加，获得了网球单打冠军和双打亚军；1924年在武昌举行的第三届全国运动会上，香港也派了代表队参加，并推举刘福基为大会顾问；1930年在杭州举行的第四届全国运动会（注：从第四届全国运动会起，就以省、市、华侨为单位），香港就作为一个单位，选派了一支包括男、女六十五名运动员的队伍前来参加，获得大会的棒球和游泳锦标；1933年在南京举行的第五届全国运动会上，香港选派了一支六十多人的队伍参加，获得了游泳锦标；1935年在上海举行的第六届全国运动会上，香港派了七十九名男、女运动员参加，获得了大会的足球锦标；1948年在上海举行的第七届全国运动会上，香港曾选派了一支包括一百零五名男、女运动员的庞大队伍参加了男子田径、游泳、足球、排球、网球、水球、羽毛球、乒乓球和女子游泳、羽毛球、乒乓球等许多项目的竞赛。可以看出，香港的中国运动员，从来就同祖国的体育运动保持着密切的联系。
    另外，记得在1913年至1934年间举行的远东运动会（注：远东运动会在这段时间内，轮流在中国、日本和菲律宾等地共举行了十届），香港每次都选派了运动员队伍参加全国的选拔赛。当时足球、排球、游泳、网球的选手，大部分都是来自香港的运动员。香港的李罗伯就两次参加中国代表队出席了远东运动会，并在1915年的第二届远东运动会上，获得了游泳项目的四个第一名；网球运动员吴仕光曾四次参加中国代表队出席了远东运动会。
    在香港的中国运动员也曾多次代表中国参加过奥林匹克运动会。解放前，我国曾经参加过三次奥林匹克运动会，在奥林匹克运动会的中国代表队中都包括着优秀的香港运动员，我记得特别清楚的是1936年在柏林举行的第十一届奥林匹克运动会上，中国代表队中的足球运动员，大部分都是香港选手。香港的中国运动员，从来就有神圣而光荣的权利代表祖国参加国际竞赛；事实证明：在过去许多国际竞赛中，他们确实也为祖国争得了荣誉。
    不久以前，中国参加十六届奥林匹克运动会筹备委员会接到了在港、澳的中国运动员的来信，他们要求参加祖国奥林匹克运动会运动队的选拔，这种殷切的爱国主义的意愿，是完全可以理解的。现在，中国参加第十六届奥林匹克运动会筹备委员会通知他们前来参加中国奥林匹克运动会运动队的选拔赛，正是符合了他们的愿望，满足了他们的要求。
    我衷心地希望港、澳的运动员们能踊跃地报名参加中国奥林匹克运动会运动队的选拔比赛，以壮大祖国的运动队伍，为国家争光。最后，向即将前来北京参加选拔赛的港、澳运动员们，表示热烈的欢迎！对于他们热爱祖国的精神，表示敬意！
