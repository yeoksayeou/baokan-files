Xinhua News Agency report: A high-yielding spring wheat variety, "Labulengde," has been discovered in Ma'erkang County, Aba Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Sichuan Province. According to a survey conducted by the Autonomous Prefecture's Agricultural and Animal Husbandry Department in early August, a plot of land planted with this variety by the Adiqiu First Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xisuo Township yielded an average of 600 to 700 jin per mu. Local Tibetan farmers said that in previous years, this type of wheat generally yielded 300 to 400 jin per mu, which is more than 50% higher than the local wheat yield.

"Labulengde" (local Tibetan name) is a branching wheat. This wheat has many small ears branching out from the main ear on each stalk, generally around ten, with the highest reaching eighteen.

Ten years ago, local Tibetans brought the seeds of "Labulengde" wheat back from Gansu. This wheat has a high degree of adaptability to local natural conditions, and can grow in river valleys, mid-mountains, and high mountains at altitudes of 2,000 to 3,000 meters above sea level. It is not picky about clay or sandy soil, is not susceptible to black穗 disease, and has strong resistance to rust.

    四川发现高产春小麦品种
    据新华社讯　四川省阿坝藏族自治州马尔康县发现了一种高产的春小麦品种——“拉卜楞得”。据自治州农牧处8月上旬调查，西梭乡阿地秋第一农业生产合作社一块种植这种品种的小麦地，平均每亩产量可达六百到七百斤。当地藏族农民谈，他们往年种植的这种小麦，每亩一般都能收到三百斤到四百斤，高出当地小麦产量50％以上。
      “拉卜楞得”（当地藏名）是一种分枝小麦。这种小麦在每枝的主穗旁又分出许多小穗，一般十个左右，最高的有十八个。
    十年前当地藏民从甘肃方面带回了“拉卜楞得”小麦种子。这种小麦对当地的自然条件有高度的适应性，在拔海二千公尺到三千公尺的河谷、半山、高山上都能生长，也不择粘土或砂地，不感染黑穗病，对锈病的抵抗力也很强。
