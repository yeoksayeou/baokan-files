The antagonistic contradiction between the working class and the bourgeoisie (referring to the national bourgeoisie, same below) in our country, is it an antagonistic contradiction or a non-antagonistic contradiction? If it is an antagonistic contradiction, then after the full-industry public-private partnership and fixed interest, is this contradiction still antagonistic? Or has it been transformed into a non-antagonistic contradiction? Or is it in the process of transforming into a non-antagonistic contradiction? These questions are not only valued by the people and theoretical circles of our country, but also concern the national industrialists and businessmen. Judging from the articles that have been published, to answer these questions correctly, it is necessary to first clarify a theoretical question, namely:
    What is an antagonistic contradiction?
    Some comrades believe that an antagonistic contradiction is a contradiction that is in an antagonistic form of struggle, a contradiction that is in a state of external conflict, and that the antagonistic nature of a contradiction is the same as the antagonistic form of the struggle of a contradiction. Starting from this theoretical premise, they assert that the nature of the contradiction between the working class and the bourgeoisie in our country is constantly transforming. Lin Diffei's article in the Dagong Bao on August 3rd can be regarded as a representative of this view. He believes that during the period of the New Democratic Revolution, this contradiction was antagonistic after the failure of the Great Revolution in 1927, and non-antagonistic at other times. During the "Five-Anti" movement, it "developed into an antagonistic contradiction," and after the "Five-Anti" movement, it "began to transform towards non-antagonism." There is a correct aspect to this view, which is that it emphasizes the close connection between the nature of a contradiction and its manifestations, and opposes talking about the nature of a hollow, abstract contradiction detached from the manifestations of the contradiction. However, this view ignores the difference between the nature of a contradiction and the form of a contradiction. Distinguishing between the antagonistic nature of a contradiction and the antagonistic form of the struggle of a contradiction has its basis in real life, and therefore can better and more accurately explain real life.
    What exactly is an antagonistic contradiction? In terms of its significance in society, an antagonistic contradiction is a contradiction in which the fundamental interests of the two sides of the contradiction cannot be reconciled. To put it more clearly, it is a contradiction in which class interests are fundamentally opposed. All antagonistic contradictions originate from class opposition. Slave owners and slaves, feudal lords and peasants, and the bourgeoisie and the working class are three basic antagonistic contradictions. Other antagonistic contradictions are generated on the basis of these contradictions, such as the contradiction between urban and rural areas in capitalist society, the contradiction between productive forces and relations of production in class society, and the contradiction between manual labor and mental labor. (A non-antagonistic contradiction is a contradiction in which the fundamental interests of the two sides are consistent.) The contradiction between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie is one of the typical examples of an antagonistic contradiction. It may be used as an example to illustrate several characteristics of an antagonistic contradiction. First, the opposition of the fundamental interests of the two sides of an antagonistic contradiction is often manifested as opposition in all aspects, and this opposition in basic antagonistic contradictions usually leads to external conflict. External conflict is an antagonistic form, but not all antagonistic forms. For example, the capitalist's economic exploitation and political oppression of workers, and armed suppression, and the workers' strikes, demonstrations, and armed uprisings against the capitalists, are all antagonism, all antagonistic external manifestations. Second, saying that fundamental interests are opposed means that there is not necessarily opposition in all interests under all conditions. In fact, antagonistic contradictions may be consistent in interests under certain conditions and in certain aspects, and a certain aspect of interest may even be the greatest common interest of the two at that time. For example, during the bourgeois revolution, the greatest common interest of the bourgeoisie and the working class was to overthrow feudal rule. Also, in countries like Egypt today, opposing colonialism is the greatest common interest of the bourgeoisie and the working class. This consistency of interests becomes the basis for the unity of the two sides of the contradiction under certain historical conditions. But even at this time, it does not mean that there is no opposition in interests between the bourgeoisie and the working class, let alone that they are consistent in fundamental interests. Third, antagonistic contradictions can be transformed into non-antagonistic contradictions, but not all antagonistic contradictions can be transformed. Basic antagonistic contradictions can only be eliminated, not transformed. The contradiction between urban and rural areas can be transformed. After the transformation, the antagonism of this antagonistic contradiction is eliminated, but the contradiction exists. The contradiction between the bourgeoisie and the working class cannot be transformed, because in this antagonistic contradiction, only by eliminating the contradiction can the antagonism be eliminated. Therefore, as far as this contradiction is concerned, when the antagonism is eliminated, it is also when the contradiction is eliminated. Fourth, saying that a contradiction is antagonistic refers to the fundamental nature of the contradiction; saying that a contradiction is in antagonism refers to its form of struggle. Therefore, we cannot say that a certain contradiction has both antagonistic and non-antagonistic natures, but can only say that the manifestations of a certain antagonistic contradiction are antagonistic under certain conditions, and also united, even with unity being the main thing, but in terms of its fundamental nature, it can only be antagonistic or non-antagonistic. (A typical example of a non-antagonistic contradiction is the contradiction between workers and peasants. Although there are some contradictions of interest between them, they are completely consistent in building socialism, and achieving socialism is the fundamental interest of workers and peasants.)
    From these situations, distinguishing between the antagonistic nature of a contradiction and the antagonistic form of the struggle of a contradiction can explain the complex situation of the contradiction more profoundly and more meticulously. (Distinguishing between the antagonistic and non-antagonistic nature of a contradiction can also explain the complex situation of the contradiction more profoundly, such as explaining the difference between the two types of socialist transformation in our country.)
    So, if the antagonistic nature of a contradiction is equated with the antagonistic form of the struggle of a contradiction, what are the disadvantages? There are at least the following shortcomings: First, this would simplify the relationship between the essence of things and their manifestations, grasping their consistency and ignoring their difference, which is contrary to the spirit of Marxist dialectics. Second, it cannot explain why the contradiction between urban and rural areas is antagonistic in capitalist society, because urban and rural areas are not always in external conflict, and it cannot even be said that the contradiction between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat is antagonistic under the conditions of bourgeois dictatorship, because they are not always in external conflict under the conditions of bourgeois dictatorship. Third, the concepts of antagonistic society, antagonistic relations of production, and antagonistic foundations should all be abolished, and Lenin's words "Under socialism, antagonism is eliminated, and contradictions exist" will also lose their meaning. Fourth, the contradiction between workers and peasants and the contradiction between labor and capital will be no different in nature, and antagonistic society and non-antagonistic society will be no different in nature. Obviously, this is of course difficult to reflect the reality truthfully, but can only simplify the reality.
    If these views can still stand, we can then further examine:
    Is the contradiction between the working class and the bourgeoisie in our country antagonistic?
    There is no doubt that the Chinese bourgeoisie is very special. Since the working class of our country established a united front with the bourgeoisie during the First Revolutionary Civil War, this united front has not been broken except during the Second Revolutionary Civil War. What is particularly special is that the bourgeoisie in our country has shown a high degree of enthusiasm and initiative in the socialist transformation of industry and commerce, and welcomed the socialist transformation with gongs and drums in the high tide of socialist transformation. After the full-industry public-private partnership, most of the industrialists and businessmen have adopted a cooperative attitude towards the public representatives, and have shown their support for the socialist cause with practical actions. Today, many industrialists and businessmen have participated in the recent discussion in the Dagong Bao on this issue, and have used a rational attitude to consider whether the contradiction between themselves and the working class is antagonistic or non-antagonistic, which also shows the special nature of the bourgeoisie in our country. These are all facts, which are rare in foreign countries. There is no doubt that, with the exception of a very few, they will all become real laborers in the future. But is the bourgeoisie in our country so special that its contradiction with the working class is not antagonistic? That it has no common ground with the bourgeoisie in foreign countries? That it inherently has a socialist tendency in its nature?
    Let us first examine the situation before the full-industry public-private partnership.
    Before the founding of the People's Republic of China, our country was in the period of the national democratic revolution, and opposition to imperialism and feudalism was the common interest of the people of our country at that time. This period is also the period when the revolutionary bourgeoisie appeared in the history of various countries, and the period when the bourgeoisie could cooperate with the working class. In fact, during this period, the bourgeoisie and the working class in our country were mostly in a united front. However, the fundamental nature of the contradiction between the bourgeoisie and the working class during this period was still antagonistic. This not only meant that the bourgeoisie was still exploiting the working class, but also referred to a series of oppositions arising from the basis of exploitation. The bourgeoisie did not become more polite to the working class in economic terms because it was in the same united front with the working class, and the working class never gave up the struggle to win its own rights. In politics, although there was unity, it did not mean that there was no antagonism. At the time of the failure of the First Revolutionary Civil War, the bourgeoisie betrayed the alliance with the working class and turned to the camp of the big landlords, big compradors, and imperialism. This was by no means accidental, and it was by no means without its roots in the nature of the bourgeoisie. Later, the political alliance between the working class and the bourgeoisie gradually recovered and became increasingly consolidated, which was inseparable from the establishment and consolidation of the worker-peasant alliance, the consolidation of the base areas, the growth of the People's Liberation Army, and the correct implementation of the united front policy of the Communist Party of China (of course, this also had its reasons on the bourgeoisie's side), and this alliance based on the national democratic revolution was not permanent, and did not cancel the opposition in the fundamental interests of the bourgeoisie and the working class. This conflict in fundamental interests arises from the nature of this contradiction and will sooner or later become a prominent aspect.
    However, after the victory of the New Democratic Revolution, because no bourgeois dictatorship was established, the antagonism between the bourgeoisie and the working class was not fully developed, and did not reach the extreme as in capitalist countries. Capitalism and the bourgeoisie in our country were born at the wrong time, and never had their golden age. When they were liberated from feudalism and imperialist rule, it was also when they were gradually tending to be eliminated. This is the most important reason why the alliance between the bourgeoisie and the working class has not been broken. Under this situation, this alliance gradually became a socialist alliance, and became a form of eliminating capitalism and transforming bourgeois elements. Due to many reasons (these reasons have been analyzed by many comrades, which will be omitted here), the bourgeoisie, violating the requirements of its nature, took the initiative to actively and willingly transform itself and move towards socialism. During this period, the contradiction between the bourgeoisie and the working class was still antagonistic in terms of its fundamental nature. This not only meant that the bourgeoisie was still exploiting the working class, but also referred to a series of oppositions arising from the basis of exploitation. The "Five-Anti" movement was the most prominent antagonistic action. Before the "Five-Anti" movement, the bourgeoisie, starting from its nature, launched a frenzied attack on the working class and the people's democratic regime. In the "Five-Anti" movement, the working class used a strong regime to give a major counterattack to the bourgeoisie's attack. This counterattack was successfully effective, which ensured that the alliance would not be broken. This struggle was a struggle within the united front, but it was also a struggle that determined the future of our country. This struggle was the first and last decisive battle carried out by the working class and the bourgeoisie in our country starting from their nature. The victory of this decisive battle determined the socialist future of our country. However, this does not mean that there was no antagonism between the working class and the bourgeoisie after the "Five-Anti" movement. No, because the bourgeoisie still controlled the enterprise, it still had the basis for antagonism. For example, capitalists are willing to process orders in the off-season, but not in the peak season; that is, in processing orders, the processing fee is calculated based on the capitalist's cost and profit. In order to obtain as much profit as possible, the capitalist is unwilling to reduce costs and save raw materials. These all show that since the founding of the People's Republic of China, although the alliance between the working class and the bourgeoisie has always been maintained, in essence, this contradiction is still antagonistic, and antagonism is also manifested in many aspects.
    As in any country, realizing socialism is not the fundamental interest of the bourgeoisie in our country, but is contrary to its nature. The fact that the bourgeoisie in our country accepts socialism is entirely the result of the education of the working class and the result of the education of real life. A bourgeoisie with an inherently socialist nature has never existed in the world, nor can it exist. This is different from the situation of peasants. Socialism is the fundamental interest of peasants. Although peasants alone will not have socialism, socialism has its roots in the nature of peasants (peasants are laborers). For capitalists, accepting socialism means not being a capitalist, and means giving up their private property; for peasants, accepting socialism, although it means giving up the status of small private owners, is not simply giving up their private property, but becoming members of collective owners on an expanded basis. Saying that socialism is contrary to the nature of the bourgeoisie does not mean that capitalists are not willingly accepting socialism. Marxism has never denied that members of the bourgeoisie can voluntarily give up their bourgeois status and accept socialism. Under the special conditions in our country, because they recognize their bright future, and are willing to control their own destiny, most members of the bourgeoisie can do this. This is what is special about the bourgeoisie in our country.
    In summary, the reason why the bourgeoisie in our country can accept socialism is that on the one hand, there are external reasons (the people's democratic regime, the socialist economy, etc.), and on the other hand, there are internal reasons (the history of alliance with the working class, opposition to imperialism, weakness, etc.), but the external reasons are the main ones. However, there is no basis in its nature. Therefore, we should not seek the roots of its ability to accept socialism in the nature of the bourgeoisie, and we should not say that the fundamental nature of this contradiction between the bourgeoisie and the working class is non-antagonistic, or has both antagonistic and non-antagonistic natures.
    Having examined the situation before the full-industry public-private partnership, we can now go further to examine:
    Is the contradiction between the bourgeoisie and the working class after the full-industry public-private partnership and fixed interest antagonistic?
    To answer this question, we must first explain the great significance of the full-industry public-private partnership and fixed interest in the historical development of our country.
    The full-industry public-private partnership and fixed interest are the turning point in the existence and elimination of capitalism and the bourgeoisie in our country, the fundamental change in capitalist relations of production, the decisive step in eliminating the antagonistic contradiction between the bourgeoisie and the working class in our country, and the future cancellation of fixed interest will be the completion of this step, and the complete elimination of antagonistic contradiction. Why do we say this? Because after the full-industry public-private partnership, capitalist enterprises are no longer the enterprises of a capitalist, but have been integrated into the joint venture enterprises, so the capitalist has lost the right to control it. The role it plays in the national economy is no different from that of state-owned enterprises. The set of management and operating methods for state-owned enterprises can be fully applied to past private enterprises. Of course, it still produces some profits for the capitalists, but after the fixed interest, the profits obtained by the capitalists are fixed within a limit, and will not increase with the increase of the overall profits. Correspondingly, the capitalist no longer plays a role in the enterprise as a capitalist, but as a staff member, but the capitalist is still a capitalist, the identity of the capitalist has not disappeared, and the bourgeoisie has not been eliminated. In short, the full-industry public-private partnership and fixed interest have brought profound and fundamental changes to capitalism and the bourgeoisie, although this change has not yet been completed. After the full-industry public-private partnership and fixed interest, socialism has basically replaced capitalism.
    At this time, it is of course inappropriate to simply say that the contradiction between the bourgeoisie and the working class is still antagonistic, because the bourgeoisie no longer controls the enterprise, and has lost the basis for antagonism. What does it use to antagonize? Individual capitalists have antagonism, but he is no longer antagonizing as a capitalist, but as a staff member with bourgeois ideas and capitalist identity. This antagonism (including ideological and action antagonism) will exist after the cancellation of fixed interest and after the capitalists have obtained the identity of complete laborers. Therefore, it is difficult for us to say that the capitalists are still antagonizing the working class as a class at this time. In this discussion, most comrades believe that this contradiction is still antagonistic at present. I think this statement has shortcomings, because this statement makes people feel that this contradiction and its fundamental nature have not changed, and are the same as before the public-private partnership and fixed interest, which is not in line with the facts.
    If so, can we say that the contradiction between the bourgeoisie and the working class has been or is being transformed into a non-antagonistic contradiction? It is also inappropriate to say this. Here we should distinguish between the bourgeoisie and bourgeois elements. Of course, the bourgeoisie in our country is composed of many bourgeois elements. But the two are still different, and the difference is the same as the difference between capitalism and capitalist enterprises.
    Bourgeois elements and capitalist enterprises are concrete things, while the bourgeoisie and capitalism are the essential characteristics of these concrete things. To transform bourgeois elements and capitalist enterprises is to eliminate their essential characteristics and give them another essential characteristic; bourgeois elements lose their bourgeois essential characteristics and gain the essential characteristics of laborers, and capitalist enterprises lose their capitalist essential characteristics and gain the socialist essential characteristics. This is the transformation of bourgeois elements and capitalist enterprises. Therefore, the bourgeoisie can only be eliminated and cannot be transformed, and capitalism can only be eliminated and cannot be transformed. Usually, the transformation of the bourgeoisie and capitalism that we talk about is used in the sense of transforming bourgeois elements and capitalist enterprises.
    If the above understanding is correct, then can we say that the contradiction between the bourgeoisie and the working class has been or is being transformed into a non-antagonistic contradiction? No, if the bourgeoisie becomes something that is not antagonistic to the working class, it is not the bourgeoisie. But it can be said that the bourgeois elements in our country are currently being transformed into people who are not antagonistic to the working class, or more strictly, the bourgeois elements have taken a decisive step in the process of being transformed into people who are not antagonistic to the working class, and this process has not yet ended because they still retain the identity of capitalists. At present, a new relationship has emerged between bourgeois elements and workers in public-private joint venture enterprises, that is, the relationship of working together. Therefore, bourgeois elements have two identities, that is, the identity of capitalist and the identity of laborer (please note that this dual identity of bourgeois elements is different from the dual nature of the bourgeoisie in our country that we generally talk about), but the identity of capitalist cannot play a leading role because there is no enterprise under his control, while the identity of worker plays a leading role in his activities (as for whether he is a good worker or a bad worker, that is another matter). It can be said that after the full-industry public-private partnership and fixed interest, the capitalists in our country have taken a decisive step in the process of transforming themselves into laborers. As long as they continue to develop their aspect as workers (this is certain), it will not be difficult to become a pure worker. It can be predicted that after these people have completely obtained the identity of laborers, due to their special origins, they may form a special class in the working class. There will still be contradictions between this class and other classes, and the contradictions at that time will of course be non-antagonistic, because it is no longer the contradiction between the working class and the bourgeoisie, but the contradiction between classes within the working class. Socialism has become their common fundamental interest.
    People who believe that the contradiction between the bourgeoisie and the working class has basically been transformed into a non-antagonistic one often cannot justify themselves. The article by Gu Ming and Tian Fang published in the People's Daily on September 7 can be used as an example to illustrate this problem. They believe that after the full-industry public-private partnership and fixed interest, "the antagonistic contradiction between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in our country during the transition period has basically been transformed into a non-antagonistic contradiction." From here, it should be logically concluded that after the cancellation of the fixed interest, this contradiction will be completely transformed into a non-antagonistic contradiction, the contradiction still exists, but the nature is completely different. However, they also said: At that time, "the remnants of the antagonistic contradiction between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie will also finally and completely disappear from the root along with the elimination of the bourgeoisie." Here it is said not only that the antagonism completely disappears, but also that the contradiction completely disappears. Obviously, this is self-contradictory.
    Can it be considered that the contradiction between the bourgeoisie and the working class in our country at the present stage has both antagonistic and non-antagonistic natures? From the above discussion, it can be known that bourgeois elements have two identities, because the nature of their contradiction with the working class has both antagonistic and non-antagonistic natures. As for the bourgeoisie, it can only be the bourgeoisie, and the bourgeoisie does not have two identities, so its contradiction with the working class does not have two natures.
    Since the several views put forward above are not completely correct, then what answer can more accurately reflect the actual situation? I think the correct answer should be what my topic points out: The antagonistic contradiction between the bourgeoisie and the working class in our country is being eliminated; in the process of elimination, it has passed a decisive step, but has not been completely eliminated. Saying that it has not been completely eliminated, because exploitation still exists; saying that in the process of elimination, it has passed a decisive step, because this exploitation has been restricted to an extremely narrow field, and the capitalists can no longer use it to antagonize the working class. Therefore, I agree with the statement that the antagonism of the contradiction between the bourgeoisie and the working class has been greatly weakened, but it should be added that the process of weakening antagonism is also the process of eliminating the contradiction. Here, what we see is the elimination of the contradiction, not just the elimination of antagonism; it is a contradiction transforming into another contradiction, not the transformation of the nature of the contradiction.

    我国工人阶级和资产阶级对抗性矛盾正在消灭中
    黄枬森
    我国工人阶级和资产阶级（指民族资产阶级，下同）的矛盾是对抗性矛盾还是非对抗性矛盾？如果是对抗性矛盾，那么这一矛盾在全行业公私合营和定息之后还是对抗性的吗？或者它已经转化成非对抗性矛盾？或者它正在向非对抗性矛盾转化的过程中？这些问题目前不但为我国人民和理论界所重视，而且为全国工商业者所关心。从已经发表的文章看来，要正确回答这些问题，有必要首先弄清楚一个理论问题，即：
            什么是对抗性矛盾？
    有的同志认为对抗性矛盾就是处于对抗的斗争形式中的矛盾、处于外部冲突状态中的矛盾，矛盾的对抗性质和矛盾斗争的对抗形式是一回事。他们从这个理论前提出发，断言我国工人阶级和资产阶级的矛盾的性质经常都在转化。8月3日大公报上林涤非的文章可以作为这种意见的代表，他认为在新民主主义革命时期这一矛盾在1927年大革命失败后是对抗性的，其余时间是非对抗性的，在“五反”运动时，又“发展成为对抗性的矛盾”，而“五反”运动之后则“开始向着非对抗性转化”。这种意见有其正确的一方面，那就是它强调了矛盾的性质和矛盾的表现形式之间的密切联系，反对脱离矛盾的表现形式来谈一种空洞抽象的矛盾的性质。但是这种意见忽略了矛盾的性质和矛盾形式之间的差别。区别矛盾的对抗性和矛盾斗争的对抗形式，在现实生活中是有其根据的，因而也就能更好地更确切地说明现实生活。
    究竟什么是对抗性矛盾？就其在社会中的意义来讲，对抗性矛盾就是矛盾双方的根本利益不能调和的矛盾。说得更明白些，就是阶级利益根本对立的矛盾。一切对抗性矛盾都来源于阶级的对立。奴隶主和奴隶，封建主和农民，资产阶级和工人阶级是三个基本的对抗性矛盾，其他对抗性矛盾都是在这些矛盾的基础上产生的，如资本主义社会中的城市与乡村、阶级社会中的生产力和生产关系、体力劳动和脑力劳动。（非对抗性矛盾就是矛盾双方根本利益一致的矛盾。）无产阶级和资产阶级的矛盾是对抗性矛盾的典型例子之一，不妨以它为例来说明对抗性矛盾的若干特点。第一，对抗性矛盾的双方的根本利益的对立，经常表现为各个方面的对立，这种对立在基本的对抗性矛盾中通常都会导致外部冲突。外部冲突是一种对抗形式而不是一切对抗形式。如资本家对工人经济上的压榨、政治上的压迫、武装的镇压，工人对资本家的罢工、示威、武装起义，都是对抗，都是对抗性的外部表现。第二，说根本利益对立，就意味着不一定在一切条件下一切利益上的对立，事实上，对抗性矛盾在某些条件下、在某些方面在利益上可能是一致的，而且某一方面的利益还可能是当时二者共同的最大利益。如资产阶级革命时期，资产阶级和工人阶级的最大的共同利益就是推翻封建统治，又如目前在埃及这种国家中，反对殖民主义就是资产阶级和工人阶级的最大的共同利益。这种利益上的一致，成为矛盾双方在一定历史条件下联合的基础。但是就是在这种时候也并不意味资产阶级和工人阶级之间就没有利益上的对立，更不意味它们在根本利益上的一致。第三，对抗性矛盾可以转化为非对抗性矛盾，但不是任何对抗性矛盾都可以转化，基本的对抗性矛盾只能消灭，不能转化。城乡矛盾可以转化，转化过后，这个对抗性矛盾的对抗性消灭了，但矛盾存在着。资产阶级和工人阶级的矛盾不能转化，因为在这个对抗性矛盾中只有消灭了矛盾才能消灭对抗性，所以就这一矛盾来说，在对抗性消灭的时候，也就是矛盾消灭的时候。第四，说矛盾是对抗性的，是就矛盾的根本性质说的；说矛盾是处于对抗中，是就其斗争形式说的。因此，我们就不能说某一矛盾兼具对抗性和非对抗性，只能说某一对抗性矛盾的表现形式在一定条件下是对抗的，也是联合的，甚至联合是主要的，但是就其根本性质来说，它只能是对抗的或非对抗的。（非对抗性矛盾的典型例子就是工人和农民的矛盾，尽管它们之间存在着一些利益上的矛盾，但它们在建设社会主义上是完全一致的，实现社会主义就是工人和农民的根本利益。）
    从这些情况看来，区别矛盾的对抗性质和矛盾斗争的对抗形式，能够更深刻地更细致地说明矛盾的复杂情况。（区别矛盾的对抗性和非对抗性，也能更深刻地说明矛盾的复杂情况，如说明我国两种社会主义改造的差别。）
    那么，如果把矛盾的对抗性质和矛盾斗争的对抗形式等同起来，有什么坏处呢？至少有这样几个缺点：第一，这就会把事物的本性及其表现形式之间的关系简单化，抓住它们之间的一致性而忽略其差别性，这和马克思主义辩证法的精神是违背的。第二，不能解释在资本主义社会中为什么城乡矛盾是对抗性的，因为城乡并不是任何时候都处在外部冲突中，甚至也不能说在资产阶级专政条件下资产阶级和无产阶级的矛盾是对抗性的，因为它们在资产阶级专政条件下也不是任何时候都处在外部冲突中。第三，对抗性社会，对抗性生产关系，对抗性基础这些概念都应该取消，列宁的话“在社会主义下，对抗消灭了，矛盾存在着。”也将失去意义。第四，工农矛盾和劳资矛盾在本性上会没有什么区别，对抗性社会和非对抗性社会在本性上也会没有什么区别。显然，这当然很难如实地反映实际，而只能把实际简单化。
    如果这些看法还能成立的话，我们就可进而考察：
    我国工人阶级和资产阶级的矛盾是不是对抗性的呢？
    毫无疑问，中国资产阶级是十分特殊的。自从我国工人阶级同资产阶级在第一次国内革命战争时期建立了统一战线之后，除了第二次国内革命战争时期以外，这个统一战线就没有破裂过。尤其特殊的是我国资产阶级在工商业的社会主义改造中表现了很高的积极性、主动性，在社会主义改造高潮
  中敲锣打鼓地欢迎社会主义改造。在全行业公私合营之后，大部分工商业者对公方代表都采取了合作态度，用实际行动表现了对社会主义事业的拥护。今天许多工商业者参加了最近在大公报上展开关于这个问题的讨论，用理智的态度来考虑自己同工人阶级的矛盾是对抗性的还是非对抗性的，也表现了我国资产阶级的特殊之处。这些都是事实，都是外国少有的。毫无疑问，除了极少数以外，他们将来都会成为真正的劳动者。但是我国资产阶级是不是特殊到这一地步，以致它和工人阶级的矛盾不是对抗性的呢？以致和外国的资产阶级没有任何共同点呢？以致在它的本性中就先天地具有社会主义的倾向呢？
    我们先考察全行业公私合营以前的情况。
    在中华人民共和国成立之前，我国处在民族民主革命时期，反对帝国主义和封建主义是我国当时全民的利益所在。这种时期，在各国历史上也正是出现革命的资产阶级的时期，资产阶级可以同工人阶级合作的时期。事实上在这个时期中我国资产阶级和工人阶级大部分时间也处在统一战线中。虽然如此，在这个时期中资产阶级和工人阶级的矛盾的根本性质仍然是对抗的。这不仅意味着资产阶级仍然在剥削着工人阶级，而且还指在剥削基础上产生的一系列的对立。资产阶级并不因为它和工人阶级同处在统一战线之内而在经济上对工人阶级客气些，工人阶级也决不放弃争取自己权利的斗争。在政治上，虽然存在着统一，也并不是不存在对抗。在第一次国内革命战争失败的时候，资产阶级便背叛过同工人阶级的联盟，投向大地主大买办帝国主义的阵营。这决不是偶然的，决不是在资产阶级本性中没有其根源的。后来，工人阶级同资产阶级在政治上的联盟又渐渐恢复起来，而且日趋巩固，这同工农联盟的建立和巩固、根据地的巩固、人民解放军的壮大以及中国共产党统一战线政策的正确实施是完全分不开的（当然这在资产阶级方面也有其原因），而且这种建立在民族民主革命基础上的联盟并不是永久性的，并没有取消资产阶级和工人阶级根本利益上的对立。这种根本利益上的冲突，是从这一矛盾的本性中产生出来的，迟早会成为突出的方面。
    但是，在新民主主义革命胜利之后，由于没有建立起资产阶级专政，资产阶级与工人阶级的对抗性并没有充分发挥出来，没有像在资本主义国家中那样发挥到极致。我国资本主义和资产阶级生不逢时，不曾有过它的黄金时代，当它从封建主义和帝国主义统治下解放出来的时候，也是它要逐渐趋于消灭的时候。这是资产阶级和工人阶级联盟没有破裂的最主要的原因。在这种情况下，这一联盟逐渐成为社会主义的联盟，成为消灭资本主义、改造资产阶级分子的一种形式。由于许多方面的原因（这些原因，许多同志已作了分析，这里从略），资产阶级违反着它的本性的要求，主动地积极地愿意改造自己，走向社会主义。在这段时期，资产阶级和工人阶级的矛盾按其根本性质来说，仍然是对抗性的。这不仅仅意味着资产阶级还剥削着工人阶级，而且还指在剥削基础上产生的一系列的对立。其中“五反”运动是最突出的一次对抗行动。在“五反”运动之前，资产阶级从其本性出发，对工人阶级和人民民主政权展开了猖狂的进攻，在“五反”运动中，工人阶级运用强有力的政权给资产阶级的进攻以重大的反击。这一反击顺利地收到了成效，才保证联盟不致于破裂。这一次斗争是统一战线内部的斗争，然而也是决定我国前途的一次斗争。这次斗争就是我国工人阶级和资产阶级从其本性出发所进行的第一次也是最后一次的决战，这次决战的胜利决定了我国的社会主义前途。但是，这并不是说，在“五反”运动之后，工人阶级和资产阶级之间就没有对抗了，不是的，由于资产阶级还掌握着企业，它就还有对抗的基础。譬如，在淡季中资本家就愿意加工订货，在旺季中就不愿意；即在加工订货中，加工费是按照资本家的成本来计算利润的，资本家为了获得尽可能多的利润，就不愿意降低成本和节约原料。这些都说明，在中华人民共和国成立以来，尽管工人阶级和资产阶级的联盟始终保持着，按其本质说来，这一矛盾仍然是对抗性的，而且对抗性也在许多方面表现出来。
    同任何国家的情形一样，实现社会主义并不是我国资产阶级的根本利益，而是违反其本性的，我国资产阶级之所以接受社会主义完全是工人阶级教育的结果，是现实生活教育的结果。先天地具有社会主义本性的资产阶级，全世界都不曾有过，也不可能有。这同农民的情况是不同的，社会主义是农民的根本利益，虽然单是农民不会有社会主义，但社会主义在农民本性中有其根源（农民是劳动者）。对于资本家来说，接受社会主义就意味着不作资本家，意味着放弃自己的私产；对于农民来说，接受社会主义虽然意味着放弃小私有主的地位，但并不是单纯放弃其私产，而是成为在扩大基础上的集体所有者的成员。说社会主义是违背资产阶级的本性的，并不意味资本家们不是心甘情愿地接受社会主义，马克思主义从来没有否认过资产阶级中的成员有可能自愿地放弃资产阶级地位、接受社会主义，而在我国特殊条件下，由于认清了自己的光明前途所在，愿意掌握自己的命运，资产阶级的大部分成员都能作到这点，这就是我国资产阶级特殊之处。
    总起来说，我国资产阶级之所以能够接受社会主义，一方面有其外部原因（人民民主政权、社会主义经济等），另一方面也有其内部原因（与工人阶级联盟的历史、反对帝国主义、软弱等），而在这里外因是主要的，但在其本性中并没有根据，因而我们不应该在资产阶级本性中去寻求它能够接受社会主义的根源，不应该把资产阶级和工人阶级这一矛盾的根本性质说成是非对抗性的，或兼具对抗性和非对抗性。
    既已考察了全行业合营以前的情况，现在我们可以更进一步来考察：
    全行业合营和定息以后的资产阶级和工人阶级的矛盾是不是对抗性的？
    要回答这个问题，必须先说明全行业合营和定息在我国历史发展中的重大意义。
    全行业合营和定息是我国资本主义、资产阶级从存在到消灭的转折点，是资本主义生产关系的根本变化，是消灭我国资产阶级和工人阶级的对抗性矛盾的决定性步骤，而将来定息的取消则是这一步骤的完成，是对抗性矛盾的完全消灭。为什么这样说呢？因为经过全行业合营之后，资本主义企业已不复是一个资本家的企业，它已经融合到合营企业中，因而资本家已失去了对它的支配权利，它在国民经济中所起的作用与国营企业没有什么区别，对国营企业的一套管理经营方法可以完全适用于过去的私人企业。当然它还为资本家生产一些利润，但是定息之后，资本家所获得的利润就固定在一个限度上，不会随整个利润的增加而增加。资本家相应地已不是作为一个资本家在企业内起作用，而是作为一个工作人员来起作用，但是资本家还是资本家，资本家的身份并没有消失，资产阶级还未消灭。总之，全行业合营和定息，给资本主义和资产阶级所带来的变化是深刻的、根本性的，虽然这个变化还未完成。经过全行业合营和定息之后，社会主义也就在基本上代替了资本主义。
    在这个时候，如果简单地说，资产阶级和工人阶级的矛盾还是对抗性的，当然是不妥当的，因为资产阶级已不掌握企业，已经失去了对抗的基础，它拿什么来对抗呢？个别资本家有对抗的，但他已不是作为资本家来对抗而是作为一个具有资产阶级思想和资本家身份的工作人员来对抗，这种对抗（包括思想上的和行动上的对抗），在定息取消之后，在资本家取得完全劳动者身份之后，也会有的。因此，我们就很难讲资本家们这时还作为一个阶级在同工人阶级对抗。在这次讨论中，多数同志都认为这一矛盾在目前仍然是对抗性的，我认为这种说法有缺点，因为这种说法使人觉得这一矛盾及其根本性质还没有起变化，还和公私合营和定息以前一样，这是不符合事实的。
    既然如此，可不可以说资产阶级和工人阶级的矛盾已经或正在转化成非对抗性矛盾了呢？这样讲也是不妥当的。这里应该区别资产阶级和资产阶级分子。当然，我国资产阶级是由许多资产阶级分子所组成的。但是二者还是有所区别，其区别正如资本主义和资本主义企业的区别一样。
    资产阶级分子和资本主义企业都是具体的东西，而资产阶级和资本主义则是这些具体东西的本质特征。改造资产阶级分子和资本主义企业，就是消灭其本质特征，使之获得另一种本质特征；资产阶级分子丧失其资产阶级的本质特征而获得劳动者的本质特征，资本主义企业丧失其资本主义的本质特征而获得社会主义的本质特征。这就是资产阶级分子和资本主义企业的转化。因此，对资产阶级只能消灭而不能改造，对资本主义也只能消灭而不能改造。通常我们讲的改造资产阶级和资本主义，是在改造资产阶级分子和资本主义企业的意义下来使用的。
    如果上述理解是不错的话，那么，能不能说资产阶级和工人阶级的矛盾已经或正在转化成非对抗性矛盾呢？不能，资产阶级如果变成和工人阶级不对抗的东西，它就不是资产阶级了。但是可以说我国资产阶级分子在目前正在转化成和工人阶级不对抗的人，或者更严格一点说，资产阶级分子在转化成和工人阶级不对抗的人的过程中，已经走了决定性的一步，由于他还保有资本家的身份，这一过程还未终结。在目前，公私合营企业中的资产阶级分子和工人之间已经出现了一种新的关系，即共同工作的关系，因而资产阶级分子有两重身份，即资本家的身份和劳动者的身份（请注意，资产阶级分子的这种两重身份，并不同于我们一般所讲的我国资产阶级的两重性），但是资本家的身份由于没有企业归他支配，已不能起主导的作用，而工作者的身份则在他的活动中起着主导的作用（至于他是一个好的工作者，还是一个坏的工作者，那是另一问题）。可以说，在全行业公私合营和定息以后，我国的资本家已在把自己改造为劳动者的步骤中迈了决定性的一步，只要他继续发挥他工作者这一方面（这是一定会的），变成一个纯粹的工作者就不是什么困难的问题了。可以预料，这些人在完全取得了劳动者身份之后，由于他们的特殊的出身，他们可能形成为工人阶级中的一个特殊阶层，这个阶层和其他阶层之间还会存在矛盾，那时的矛盾当然是非对抗性的，因为那时它已不是工人阶级和资产阶级的矛盾，而是工人阶级内部阶层之间的矛盾了，社会主义已经成为它们的共同的根本利益了。
    认为资产阶级和工人阶级的矛盾已经基本上转化成非对抗性的人，常常不能自圆其说。以9月7日人民日报上发表的顾明和田方的文章为例可以说明这个问题。他们认为在全行业公私合营和定息之后，“我国过渡时期无产阶级和资产阶级的对抗性矛盾便基本上转化为非对抗性矛盾了。”从这里应该逻辑地得出结论：在定息取消之后，这一矛盾就会完全转化成非对抗性矛盾，矛盾还存在，但性质完全不同了。但是，他们又说：在那个时候，“无产阶级和资产阶级的对抗性矛盾的残余，也将随着资产阶级的消灭而最后从根本上完全消失。”这里说的不仅是对抗性的完全消失，而且是矛盾的完全消失。显然，这是自相矛盾。
    能不能认为现阶段我国资产阶级和工人阶级的矛盾是兼具对抗和非对抗两重性质呢？从上面的论述可以知道，资产阶级分子具有两重身份，因为他们和工人阶级的矛盾的性质是兼具对抗和非对抗，至于资产阶级只能是资产阶级，资产阶级并没有两重身份，因而它和工人阶级的矛盾就不具有两重性。
    既然前面提出的几种看法，都不是完全正确的，那么，什么回答能更精确地反映实际情况呢？我认为正确的回答应该是我的题目所指出的：我国资产阶级和工人阶级这一对抗性矛盾正在消灭中；在消灭过程中，它已迈过了决定性的一步，但还没有完全消灭。说没有完全消灭，因为剥削还存在；说在消灭过程中，已迈过决定性的一步，因为这个剥削已被限制到极其狭隘的领域，资本家已不能用它来同工人阶级对抗。因此，我同意资产阶级和工人阶级的矛盾的对抗性已大大削弱的说法，但是，应该补充一句，对抗性削弱的过程也就是矛盾消灭的过程。这里，我们看见的是矛盾的消灭，而不仅仅是对抗性的消灭；是一个矛盾转化为另一个矛盾，而不是矛盾的性质的转化。
