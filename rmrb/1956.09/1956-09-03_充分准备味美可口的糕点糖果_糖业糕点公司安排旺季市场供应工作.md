Xinhua News Agency report:
    The first National Manager Conference of the China Sugar and Pastry Company, which concluded on August 28th, spent half a month studying and arranging market supply and purchasing work for the peak season, and determined the business management policy and organizational structure plan.

    After analyzing the changes and characteristics of this year's peak season market, the conference determined that the main tasks for the second half of this year are: to accelerate the establishment and improvement of institutions, vigorously promote sales, ensure market supply during the peak season, do a good job in the purchase, allocation, and supply of sugar production for the year, and strengthen the operation of commodities such as candies, pastries, dairy products, and canned goods. The conference particularly emphasized the need to closely integrate with other relevant fraternal specialized companies and supply and marketing cooperatives, and organize and lead joint state-private shops and small vendors to expand sugar sales. It also called for a planned increase in brown sugar production to meet the needs of the broad masses of the people, especially farmers. In the supply of canned goods and milk powder, it is necessary to not only do a good job in supplying cities and industrial and mining areas, but also ensure the supply of special needs such as exploration teams, remote areas, and infants.

    The conference required that in business operations, the seasonality of commodities and the laws of production and sales, especially the laws of holiday supply, should be grasped. It is necessary to maintain and promote the special flavor of high-quality products, continuously increase varieties, and strive for the hygiene, deliciousness, and palatability of commodities. Deteriorated or unclean goods must be strictly prohibited from being sold. At the same time, attention should be paid to the beauty and practicality of packaging, and respect should be given to the eating habits of ethnic minorities.

    The conference believes that at present, there are more than 70,000 candy and pastry businesses above the town level across the country, with more than 100,000 employees. It is necessary to strengthen organizational leadership over them and further implement socialist transformation. It requires all regions to quickly establish and improve institutions to bring work onto a regular track.
