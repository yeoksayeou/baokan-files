Correcting Subjectivism and Commandism
Sanyuan County's Agricultural Cooperatives Conduct Democratic Inspections

(Our dispatch) Xi'an—Sanyuan County, Shaanxi Province, is conducting democratic inspections within all agricultural cooperatives in the county to correct bureaucratic and commandist work styles.

As early as late June, at a county and township cadres meeting convened by the county party committee, it was discovered that some cooperatives had commandist work styles. For example, Zhang Songbai, a member of the Fengshou Agricultural Cooperative in Duli Township, was not assigned work by the production team one time, so he automatically joined a production group to work. As a result, the production team leader criticized him for being "undisciplined and unorganized" and decided not to give Zhang Songbai work points. Sun Shijing, a member of the Jieli Cooperative in Xinzhuang Township, was somewhat careless in his work. When production team leader Sun Zhenhai criticized him, he did not accept it, so the cooperative discussed and decided to place Sun Shijing under the production team's supervision for three months. Based on these situations, the CCP Sanyuan County Committee sent cadres to conduct in-depth investigations in various agricultural cooperatives and found that varying degrees of commandist work styles existed in most agricultural cooperatives. Based on this situation, the county party committee decided to universally mobilize members in all agricultural cooperatives in the county to carry out democratic inspections.

During this inspection, it was discovered that some cooperative cadres used methods such as arbitrarily deducting work points, not assigning work, labeling, production control, and penal labor to force members to follow their opinions; some cooperatives did not consult with the masses on matters and acted arbitrarily. After the inspection, the cadres of various agricultural cooperatives generally humbly accepted the criticism from the members and conscientiously conducted self-criticism at the members' congress. During the major inspection, the members also raised many suggestions for improvement and rationalization of some unreasonable regulations and systems in the cooperative in the past.

Through this democratic inspection, the members felt that they were truly masters of their own affairs, and the cooperative cadres also felt that the cooperative's work would be easier to do in the future. They said that this democratic inspection was truly a brain-washing for them.

While mobilizing members to conduct inspections, the county party committee also conducted inspections of the subjective thinking work style of the leadership, because the commandist work style of the cooperative cadres was somewhat inseparable from the subjective thinking of the county leadership. For example, when digging wells last winter and spring, the county party committee vigorously praised women for digging wells, encouraging each woman to work one hundred and forty labor days, resulting in many women having miscarriages, fainting, and other phenomena. Members had raised many opinions about this, but the county party committee did not pay attention to improving it, but instead criticized those who raised opinions for being unwilling to work, thus also supporting the commandist work style of the cooperative cadres. After this inspection, the county party committee recognized the harm of the subjective thinking work style.

During this democratic inspection, good cooperative cadres and good cooperative management experiences were also promptly commended.

Currently, more than two hundred agricultural cooperatives in the county have carried out democratic inspections, and new atmospheres have emerged in the cooperatives that have undergone democratic inspections. However, this is only the beginning of democratic cooperative management. How to consolidate the achievements of this democratic inspection and continue to implement the spirit of democratic cooperative management, the county party committee still needs to study some specific and feasible methods.

### 纠正主观主义和强迫命令作风  三原县各农业社开展民主大检查

    纠正主观主义和强迫命令作风
    三原县各农业社开展民主大检查
    本报讯  陕西省三原县在全县各农业社内开展民主大检查，纠正工作中的官僚主义、强迫命令作风。
    早在6月下旬，在县委召开的县、乡干部会议上，就发现在有些社存在着强迫命令的作风。如独李乡丰收农业社社员张松柏，有一次生产队没有给他派活，他就自动参加到一个生产组去工作，结果，生产队长批评他是“无组织无纪律”，并决定不给张松柏记工分。新庄乡解理社社员孙士敬干活有些粗糙，生产队长孙振海批评他他不接受，社内就讨论决定把孙士敬交生产队管制三个月。中共三原县委根据这些情况，曾派出干部深入各农业社进行调查，发现在大部分农业社里，都存在着程度不同的强迫命令作风。根据这种情况县委就决定在全县各个农业社里，普遍发动社员开展民主大检查。
    这次检查中，发现有些社干部用乱扣工分、不派活、扣帽子、管制生产、罚劳役等办法来强制社员听从自己的意见；有些社有事不和群众商量，独断专行，经过检查，各农业社干部，一般都虚心接受了社员的批评，并在社员大会上认真地进行检讨。在大检查中，社员还对社内过去一些不合理的规定和制度提出很多改进意见和合理化建议。
    经过这次民主大检查，社员们感到自己真正当家作主了，社干部也都感到今后社的工作好做了。他们说，这次民主大检查真是给自己洗了一次脑筋。
    在发动社员检查的同时，县委对领导思想上的主观主义思想作风也进行了检查，因为社干部的强迫命令作风有些是和县领导上的主观主义思想分不开的。例如去冬今春打井的时候，县委大力表扬妇女打井，鼓励每个妇女做到一百四十个劳动日，结果造成很多妇女流产、昏倒等现象。社员为此曾提出很多意见，但是县委并没有注意改进，反而批评那些提意见的人是不愿意劳动，因此，也支持了社干部的强迫命令作风。经过这次检查，县委认识了主观主义思想作风的危害。
    这次民主大检查，对那些好的社干部和好的办社经验，也及时地进行了表扬。
    目前，全县已有二百多个农业社开展了民主检查，经过民主检查的社都出现了新的气象。但是，这只是民主办社的开始，如何把这次民主检查的成果巩固下来，继续贯彻民主办社的精神，县委还要研究一些具体可行的办法。
