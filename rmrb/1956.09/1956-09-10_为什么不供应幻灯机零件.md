    Why are Projector Parts Not Supplied?
    At the end of last year, the lens glass of the projector in our Yifeng County Cultural Center in Jiangxi Province broke. At that time, we wrote to the Shanghai Projector Parts Manufacturing Factory to purchase it, but they returned the money, saying that they could not supply it. We thought it was out of stock, so we waited for a while. Recently, we sent the money to the Shanghai Sales Office of Shanghai Film Projector Parts Manufacturing Factory again, but the reply was still "cannot be supplied." I don't understand why the projector factory sells projectors but doesn't supply parts? There is no projector repair shop at present. Does it mean that if the projector is slightly damaged, we have to buy a new one? I hope the projector factory will supply projector parts so that we can repair and assemble projectors ourselves.　Chun Wu

### 为什么不供应幻灯机零件

    为什么不供应幻灯机零件
    去年年底，我们江西省宜丰县文化馆的幻灯机的镜头玻璃坏了，当时就写信到上海幻灯机件制造厂去购买，结果他们把钱退了回来，说是不能供应。我们以为是缺货，就等了一阵，最近又把钱寄到上海电影幻灯机件制造厂上海营业所去，不料回信仍是“不能供应”。我不明白，为什么幻灯厂卖幻灯机却不供应零件？目前又没有幻灯修理厂，难道幻灯机坏了一点点，就必须重新买个新的吗？希望幻灯厂供应幻灯零件，好让我们自己修配幻灯。　纯武
