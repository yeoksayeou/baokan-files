Xinhua News Agency, Xining, September 10th: Thirteen newly built weather stations in resource exploration areas such as the Qaidam Basin and the Tanggula Mountains in Qinghai Province have recently begun sending weather information and accumulating meteorological data.

Thanks to the establishment of these new weather stations, the Qinghai Provincial Meteorological Bureau can now have a more comprehensive grasp of climate change throughout the province. The Xining Meteorological Observatory has started forecasting the daily weather since last month, which is welcomed by the exploration personnel, transportation personnel, and agricultural cooperative members working in the field.

Qinghai Province is located in the northeastern corner of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and many climate changes often begin here and affect the climate of various provinces to its east and southeast. The development of Qinghai's meteorological work is of great significance for the whole country, especially the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River provinces, to grasp the climate change situation.

    青海省资源勘探地区
    新建气象站开始预报气候
    据新华社西宁10日电　青海省柴达木盆地和小唐古拉山等资源勘探地区新建的十三个气象站，最近开始发气象情报和积累气象资料。
    由于新建立这些气象站，青海省气象局能够比较全面地掌握全省气候变化情况。西宁气象台已经从上月开始预报每天的天气，在野外工作的勘探人员、运输人员和农业社社员都很欢迎。
    青海省处在青藏高原的东北角，许多气候变化常常从这里开始，并且影响到它东部和东南部各省的气候。青海省气象事业的发展，对全国尤其是黄河中下游各省掌握气候变化情况有很重要意义。
