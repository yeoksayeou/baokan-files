Xinhua News Agency, September 16th, Cairo Dispatch: Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser condemned the so-called "Suez Canal Users' Association" organized by Western countries on September 15th as an organization actually established for the purpose of declaring war.

The Egyptian President said that we must resist any aggression and fight against those who attempt to infringe upon our sovereignty. If attacked, Egypt will wage an organized war, a comprehensive war, and a guerrilla war. Those who attack Egypt will soon realize that they will bring disaster upon themselves. Whoever attacks Egypt attacks the entire Arab world. He also warned: Anyone who attacks Egypt should know that their interests and resources in the Middle East will be gone forever—"I repeat, gone forever."

Nasser delivered the speech at a graduation ceremony of the Egyptian Air Force Academy. He emphasized that Egypt will show the world that when small and weak countries have full determination to defend their rights and maintain their dignity, they can undoubtedly achieve their goals.

While the Egyptian President was speaking, warm applause, cheers, and laughter repeatedly resounded among the attendees.

Nasser said that we hear the sound of Britain and France brandishing their swords, and the purpose of these major powers is to infringe upon our sovereignty. He said, in the name of the Egyptian people who have successfully defeated foreign rule, aggression, and feudalism in the past, I declare that we intend to defend our sovereignty at any cost.

Nasser criticized the attitude of the United States, saying, "The US President once said that he hoped for peace. Then, the Secretary of State put forward a plan that would ultimately lead to war."

The Egyptian President said that Western countries announced the establishment of a "Users' Association" with the aim of snatching the canal from Egypt and depriving Egypt of the right to collect tolls. This action violates the Constantinople Convention of 1888. It is not feasible for two institutions to organize the navigation of the canal.

He said that it is also unacceptable to establish an institution outside Egypt to continue collecting canal tolls.

Nasser said that if such a thing were permissible, we could also establish a London Port Users' Association, which would create a situation that would cause international chaos and put an end to international law and international relations.

Nasser denounced the recent series of conspiracies by Britain, France, and the United States to infringe upon Egypt's sovereignty through monetary bribery or the threat of force. He also exposed the Western countries' arrogant plan to occupy Egypt within forty-eight hours.

He accused Britain and France of putting pressure on foreign employees of the Suez Canal Company to leave their jobs.

He then said, but I declare that the canal will continue to operate smoothly as it has in the past. Seventy Egyptian and Greek pilots refused to succumb to coercion and inducement.

Nasser then announced in the name of the Egyptian people that medals would be awarded to these pilots to commend their loyalty and contribution.

He said, do you know how decadent the West has become? Yesterday, a large number of ships sailed to Port Said and Suez requesting to pass through the canal. According to a pre-planned conspiracy to disrupt canal navigation, fifty ships—the largest number in many years—were gathered at these two ports. However, with the help of seventy Egyptian and Greek pilots who refused to accept bribes and preferred to continue working, we safely guided these ships through.

    纳赛尔警告帝国主义不要黩武
    埃及将不惜任何代价保卫国家主权
    “使用国协会”计划是个会导向战争的方案
    新华社16日讯　开罗消息：埃及总统加麦尔·阿卜杜勒·纳赛尔9月15日谴责西方国家的所谓“运河使用国协会”的组织实际上是一个为了宣战而建立的组织。
    埃及总统说，我们一定抵抗任何侵略，并且对那些企图侵犯我们的主权的人进行战斗。如果受到进攻，埃及将进行有组织的战争、全面的战争和游击战争。那些进攻埃及的将会很快认识到，他们将因此给自己带来灾难。谁进攻埃及，谁就是进攻整个阿拉伯世界。他还警告说：任何进攻埃及的人都应当知道，他们在中东的利益和资源将永远完蛋——“我重复一遍，是永远完蛋。”
    纳赛尔是在埃及空军学校的一个毕业典礼上发表演说。他强调说，埃及将向世界显示，当弱小国家有充分的决心来保卫它们的权利和维护它们的尊严的时候，它们无疑地是能够达到它们的目的的。
    在埃及总统讲话的时候，到会者一再响起了热烈的掌声、欢呼声和欢笑声。
    纳赛尔说，我们听到英国和法国正在挥舞它们的刀剑的声音，这些大国的目的在于侵犯我们的主权。他说，我以在过去成功地战胜了外国统治、侵略和封建主义的埃及人民的名义宣布，我们打算不惜任何代价来保卫我们的主权。
    纳赛尔指责美国的态度说，“美国总统曾说过他希望和平。接着，国务卿提出了最后将会导向战争的方案。”
    埃及总统说，西方国家宣布要成立“使用国协会”，它的目的是要从埃及抢夺运河并剥夺埃及收通行费的权利，这种行动违反了1888年君士坦丁堡公约。由两个机构来组织运河的航行是不可行的。
    他说，同样地在埃及国外设立一个机构来继续收运河通行费也是不能容许的。
    纳赛尔说，如果这样的事情可以容许的话，我们也可以成立一个伦敦港使用者协会，这样就会产生一个引起国际上的混乱和使国际法和国际关系完结的局面。
    纳赛尔斥责了英、法、美三国最近一系列企图以金钱收买或者用武力威胁来侵害埃及主权的阴谋。他还揭露了西方国家有一个四十八小时之内占领埃及的狂妄计划。
    他指责英国和法国对苏彝士运河公司的外籍雇员施加压力要他们离开工作。
    他接着说，但是，我宣布，运河将会像过去那样继续畅行无阻。有七十个埃及领航员和希腊领航员拒绝对威逼利诱屈服。
    纳赛尔接着以埃及人民的名义宣布，奖给这些领航员勋章，表扬他们的忠诚和贡献。
    他说，你们知道西方堕落到了什么地步吗？昨天，大量的船只开到了塞得港和苏彝士要求通过运河。按照一个预先策划好的破坏运河航运的阴谋，有五十条船——这是许多年数量最大的一次——被集结到这两个港口。但是，靠了七十个拒绝接受贿赂、宁愿继续工作下去的埃及和希腊籍领航员的帮助，我们安全地把这些船只引导过去了。
