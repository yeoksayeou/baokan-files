    Welcoming the Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Nepal to Visit Our Country
    The Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Nepal, Tanka Prasad Acharya, who is visiting our country at the invitation of our government, will arrive in Beijing today. The Chinese people wholeheartedly welcome the arrival of our distinguished guest.
    Prime Minister Acharya's visit to our country marks a new stage in the traditional friendly relations between the people of China and Nepal. For more than a thousand years, the exchanges between the people of China and Nepal have been very close. Now that a new page has been turned in the history of Asia, the friendly relations between China and Nepal have new content and new significance. Prime Minister Acharya's visit to China and his personal contact with Chinese government leaders and people from all walks of life will undoubtedly further promote understanding, trust, and cooperation between our two countries.
    The friendly relations between our country and Nepal are based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. In recent years, the governments and people of both countries have followed the Five Principles and made joint efforts to establish and develop good-neighborly and friendly relations between China and Nepal, and have achieved significant achievements. Recently, the Chinese government delegation and the Nepalese government delegation signed the "Agreement between the People's Republic of China and the Kingdom of Nepal on Maintaining Friendly Relations and on Trade and Transportation between the Tibet Region of China and Nepal" after friendly negotiations, and also exchanged notes on specific issues in the relations between the two countries. The friendly relations between China and Nepal will thus develop and consolidate day by day.
    Our government and people have always attached great importance to and highly praised the wise policies pursued by the Nepalese government in international relations. The Nepalese government advocates peace and neutrality, opposes colonialism, does not participate in Western military blocs, and promotes friendly cooperation between countries. This policy is not only conducive to the peaceful development of Nepal and the smooth implementation of its first five-year plan, but also has played a good role in maintaining peace in Asia and expanding the area of peace. Facts have proved that Nepal's active policy of maintaining peace and neutrality not only conforms to the interests and aspirations of the Nepalese people, but is also completely consistent with the common interests and aspirations of many countries in Asia.
    Our people have always cherished the friendship and cooperation with the Nepalese people. From the day it was founded, our government has actively pursued a peaceful foreign policy, willing to coexist peacefully and cooperate friendly with all countries, especially its neighbors, and advocates treating all countries equally, regardless of size. The friendly relations between our country and many countries in Asia have been established in this spirit. The Chinese people have high expectations for the visit of the Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Nepal, Acharya, to our country at our invitation; the Chinese people sincerely hope that Prime Minister Acharya's friendly visit to our country will further promote mutual understanding and trust between China and Nepal, further strengthen the friendly relations between the two countries, and further develop the friendship between our two countries.

    欢迎尼泊尔王国首相访问我国
    应我国政府邀请前来我国访问的尼泊尔王国首相坦卡·普拉萨德·阿查里雅，将在今天到达北京。中国人民衷心地欢迎我国的贵宾的到来。
    阿查里雅首相这次到我国来访问，标志着中、尼两国人民之间的传统的友好关系已经进入了一个新的阶段。一千多年以来，中、尼两国人民之间的往还，一向就是十分密切的。现在，亚洲的历史已经展开了新的一页，中国和尼泊尔之间的友好关系也就有了新的内容和新的意义。阿查里雅首相访问中国，亲自同中国的政府领袖和各界人士进行接触，无疑将更加促进我们两国之间的了解、信任和合作。
    我国和尼泊尔之间的友好关系，是建立在和平共处五项原则的基础之上的。这几年来，两国政府和人民遵循着五项原则，对建立和发展中尼两国之间的睦邻友好关系，共同进行了努力，并且已经取得了重大成就。最近我国政府代表团和尼泊尔王国政府代表团经过友好的谈判，签订了“中华人民共和国和尼泊尔王国保持友好关系以及关于中国西藏地方和尼泊尔之间的通商和交通的协定”，同时就两国关系中的若干具体事项交换了照会。中尼两国友好关系从此将日益发展和巩固。
    我国政府和人民对尼泊尔政府在国际关系中所执行的明智的政策，一向非常重视，并且予以崇高的评价。尼泊尔政府主张和平中立、反对殖民主义、不参加西方军事集团、促进各国之间友好合作，这种政策不但有利于尼泊尔的和平发展，有利于它第一个五年计划的顺利执行，而且对于维护亚洲的和平和扩大和平地区，已经起了良好的推动作用。事实已经证明，尼泊尔这种维护和平和中立的积极政策，不但符合于尼泊尔人民的利益和愿望，而且是同亚洲许多国家的普遍利益和愿望完全一致的。
    我国人民素来珍视同尼泊尔人民之间的友谊和合作。我国政府从成立的那天起，就积极地奉行和平外交政策，愿意同所有国家、特别是自己的邻邦和平共处，友好合作，并且主张不论国家大小，一视同仁。我国同亚洲许多国家之间的友好关系，就是本着这种精神建立起来的。中国人民对尼泊尔王国首相阿查里雅应邀访问我国，寄以热烈的期待；中国人民诚挚地希望，阿查里雅首相到我国的友好访问，将更加促进中尼两国的互相了解和信任，将更加加强两国之间的友好关系，使我们两国之间的友谊得到进一步的发展。
