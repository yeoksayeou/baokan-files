    Wuxi is to build a large shipyard. It is estimated that by the time the factory is fully completed in 1959, it will be able to manufacture 100 large iron barges of 100 tons each, 30 steam tugboats of 100 horsepower each, and 15 new-type iron-hulled passenger ships capable of accommodating 150 to 200 passengers each year. Wuxi has excellent water transport connections, so the factory will also undertake the repair of large ships in Wuxi, Changzhou, Suzhou, Jiangyin and other places.
    This shipyard will be a mechanized and semi-mechanized factory, divided into more than ten large workshops such as metalworking, woodworking, sand casting, electric welding, and sheet metal work. This year, the metalworking and sand casting workshops, as well as 600 square meters of dormitories, will be built. In order to facilitate the launching of ships, the 100-meter-long river section near the factory building will also be widened and deepened.

    无锡将建船舶修造厂
    本报讯　无锡将要兴建一座规模较大的船舶修造厂。这个工厂预计到1959年全部建成后，每年能制造一百吨大型铁质驳船一百艘，一百匹马力蒸汽拖轮三十艘，可容纳一百五十到二百个客位的新型铁壳客轮十五艘。无锡市水路交通四通八达，所以这个工厂还担负了无锡、常州、苏州、江阴等地大型船舶的修理任务。
    这个船舶修造厂是一个机械化和半机械化的工厂，共分金工、木工、翻砂、电焊、冷作等十多个大型车间。今年要兴建的有金工、翻砂等车间和六百平方公尺的宿舍。为了便于船舶下水，还准备把靠近厂房的长达一百公尺的河道拓宽加深。
