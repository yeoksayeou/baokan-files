    Making Things Convenient for People
    Zhou Changxiang
    I often travel on business and have been to many places throughout the country, using various means of transportation. I would like to write about some of the good, convenient practices I have seen during my travels for the reference of transportation departments and service industries in various regions.
    Buying tickets at Shanghai Station　When traveling from Shanghai to Hangzhou, buying tickets at the station is very crowded, but it is possible to buy tickets quickly. The reason is that there is a staff member responsible for maintaining order and answering questions who also sells tickets; he only sells one type of ticket, which is for Shanghai to Hangzhou. This allows about half of the people to buy their tickets from him; and since he only sells one type of ticket, it is not too much trouble. In addition, he hands out the tickets to the passengers in order, so the queuing order is not disrupted at all.
    Good food on ships　On ships traveling between Shanghai and Chongqing on the Yangtze River, the food is inexpensive and of good quality. Breakfast costs one dime per person, Type A lunch costs 35 cents per person, and Type B costs 25 cents per person. The meals are very rich and tasty. Spending 60 to 80 cents a day can provide very good meals. This is much better than the 70-80 cent set meals on trains. Of course, ships have better conditions, but trains should not be too far behind.
    Attentive service on small trains　The small trains running on the Kunming-Zhanjiang Railway have far inferior equipment and conditions compared to other railways in the country, but the train attendants are attentive and provide a comfortable ride. There are no loudspeakers on the train, so the train attendants directly address passengers about various precautions. They are proactive in providing books and tea. What is particularly satisfying is that the train also provides food for passengers. There is no dedicated dining car on this train, only a place for cooking. The train attendants use this space to cook meals and noodles for passengers, costing 20-30 cents per meal, and the quality is very good. At the same time, the train attendants deliver the food to the seats of the passengers who want to eat, without waiting or crowding, to the delight of the passengers.
    Combined bus and train tickets　Traveling from Kunming to Jinchengjiang requires taking two types of transportation; from Kunming to Zhanyi is by train, and from Zhanyi onwards is by bus. However, tickets can be purchased at once in Kunming, so passengers are spared the trouble of buying tickets in Zhanyi. This method also exists in other places, such as buying boat tickets from Tianjin to the sea in Beijing. It is suggested that combined tickets be vigorously promoted, such as Shenyang being able to sell boat tickets to Shanghai, Qingdao and other places via Dalian.
    Lunch outside the station　There is no dining car on the train from Jinchengjiang to Liuzhou. At noon, the train stops for 30 minutes at a large station along the way, and passengers can leave the station to eat by showing their tickets. There are many vendors outside the station selling all kinds of food at very cheap prices. I think this is a very good method, as it solves the lunch problem for passengers, and some local people can also increase their income, while the railway can also reduce the number of employees it needs.
    Hotels sell train tickets　Hotels in Shanghai, Hangzhou, and the surrounding areas generally sell train tickets for passengers without charging any handling fees. The procedure is very simple, and any service staff can handle it. This adds a lot of convenience to some out-of-town visitors who are unfamiliar with the area.

    给人方便

    我经常出差，走过全国许多地方，使用过一些不同的交通工具。特将自己在旅途中所看到的一些好的、给人方便的地方写出来，供各地交通运输部门和服务性行业参考。
    上海站买票　从上海去杭州，在车站买票，人很多，但却很快能买到。原因是有一个负责维持秩序和解答问题的工作人员在代卖车票；他手上只有一种票，就是上海去杭州的。这样就有一半左右的人在他手上就把票买好；而他只卖一种票，也并不太麻烦。另外，他是依次将票送到旅客手上来的，排队秩序一点不乱。
    轮船上的伙食好　长江中上海到重庆间的轮船上，伙食价廉物美，早餐每客一角，中午甲种餐每客三角五，乙种每客二角五，饭菜都很丰富，味道也好。一天花六角到八角钱，可以吃得很好。这比在火车上一餐七、八角的客饭要好得多，当然轮船上有它较好的条件，但是火车也不应该差得太远呵。
    小火车上服务周到　昆沾铁路上行驶的小火车，设备条件比全国其他铁路相差甚远，但是列车员服务周到，坐起来反觉舒服。车上没有扩音器，列车员就当面向旅客讲各种注意事项。在供应图书、茶水方面都很主动。尤其令人满意的是，车上还供给旅客饮食。这种车上没有专门的餐车，仅有一个作饭作菜的地方。列车员就利用这点地方给旅客做菜饭和面食，二、三角钱一餐，质量很好。同时，由列车员将饮食送到要用饭的旅客的座位上，不等，不挤，旅客皆大欢喜。
    汽车火车联运票　从昆明到金城江要坐两种车，其中昆明到沾益是火车，沾益以后是汽车。但是在昆明就可以一次把票买好，旅客到沾益不再受买票之苦。这种方法其他地方也有。如北京可以买天津出海的船票等。建议大力推广联运票，如沈阳就可以卖经大连去上海、青岛等地的船票。
    出站午餐　从金城江到柳州的火车上，没有餐车。中午，车到中途大站，停车三十分钟，乘客可以凭票出站吃饭。站外有许多卖各式各样吃食的，价钱也很便宜。我认为，这个办法很好，为旅客解决了午餐问题，当地的一些人也可以增加一些收入，铁路上也可以少占用一些员工。
    旅馆代买车票　上海、杭州一带的旅馆，一般都代旅客买火车票，而且不收任何手续费。手续很简单，找任何一个服务员办理都行。这为一些人地生疏的远道来客增加了不少方便。
