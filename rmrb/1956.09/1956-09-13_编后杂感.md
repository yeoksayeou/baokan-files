Editor's Musings

The transportation tools in the hands of the masses are a transportation force that cannot be ignored. Our country has a vast territory, and the development of transportation cannot currently keep up with the needs of the people. Materials scattered in the vast countryside need to be transported to the main transportation lines by the transportation tools of the masses, and then transported outwards; daily necessities concentrated on the transportation lines also need to be transported to consumers by the transportation tools of the masses. Therefore, it is extremely important to give full play to the transportation power of the masses and to promote the transportation enthusiasm of the masses.

However, some places still lack understanding of the role of mass transportation tools. The transportation management and taxation departments of Henan Province have formulated many unreasonable regulations and cumbersome procedures for mass transportation, which resulted in more than 5,000 motorized vehicles stopping participating in transportation in the first half of this year, causing a very tense transportation situation. This incident powerfully illustrates that ignoring the transportation power of the masses will inevitably lead to adverse consequences.

Some people believe that the transportation tools in the hands of the masses are backward things that will be eliminated sooner or later. They have forgotten the reality: before modern transportation tools replace backward tools, not only should the transportation tools of the masses not be artificially restricted or banned, but they should also be cherished and helped. Therefore, the correct approach should be to adopt active methods in taxation and management policies to encourage the transportation enthusiasm of the masses, provide technical assistance in tool improvement, and allow them to fully exert their potential power.

    编后杂感
    群众手里的运输工具是一支不可忽视的运输力量。我国地区辽阔，交通运输的发展目前还赶不上人民的需要。分散在广大农村的物资需要靠群众的运输工具把它运到主要的交通干线上去，然后再向外运；集中在交通干线上的生活日用品，也需要群众的运输工具把它运送到消费者手里。因此，充分发挥群众的运输力量，发扬群众的运输积极性是一件极其重要的事。
    但是，有些地方对于群众运输工具的作用，还缺乏认识。河南省交通管理部门和税收部门，对于群众运输制定了许多不合理的规定和繁琐的手续，使得全省有五千多辆汽马车在今年上半年停止参加运输，造成运输十分紧张的情况。这件事情有力地说明了忽视群众的运输力量就必然会造成不良的后果。
    有些人认为群众手里的运输工具是落后的东西，迟早总是要淘汰的。他们忘记了现实的情况：在现代化的交通工具没有代替落后的工具以前，不仅不能人为地限制或取缔群众的运输工具，而且应该加以爱护和帮助。因此，正确的做法应该是在税收和管理政策上要采取积极的办法，鼓励群众的运输热情，在工具改进方面给予技术帮助，让他们充分发挥潜在力量。
