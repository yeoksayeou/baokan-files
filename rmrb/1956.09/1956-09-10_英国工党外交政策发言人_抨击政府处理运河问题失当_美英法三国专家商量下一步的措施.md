Xinhua News Agency, September 9th, London dispatch: British Labour Party's foreign policy spokesman, Robens, criticized the Conservative government's mishandling of the Suez Canal issue on September 8th.

Robens said that if the news from Cairo regarding the failure to reach an agreement with Nasser is true, then Eden would have to resign.

Robens warned that the use of force to resolve the Suez issue would "violate the United Nations Charter," "drive India and Ceylon out of the Commonwealth, and unite the entire Arab world and the Asian world against us."

Robens said, "The Labour Party's policy is very clear. British and French troops must not go to war with Egypt to implement the internationalization of the Suez Canal. The whole issue should be submitted to the United Nations, and in fact, this issue should have been submitted to the United Nations from the very beginning."

Xinhua News Agency, September 9th dispatch: Middle East issue experts from the United States, Britain, and France began consultations in Washington on September 8th to discuss how to determine the West's next steps in the event that Egypt refuses to accept the Dulles Plan.

According to a United Press report, the Eden government currently has no intention of abandoning the basic principle of internationalizing the canal as outlined in the Dulles Plan. Sources in London say that one of the measures being considered by British officials is to intensify "economic sanctions" against Egypt.

There are indications that Britain is also changing its mind and considering submitting the Suez Canal issue to the United Nations.

A London dispatch published in the "New York Times" on September 8th stated that this change in the British government is influenced by four factors. These four factors are: inconsistencies between Britain and the United States; the British Labour Party's opposition to coercive measures against Egypt; the failure of the Menzies mission and the British government's indecision on the next steps; and the realization that the military buildup of Britain and France is insufficient to guarantee a "quick military victory."

    抨击政府处理运河问题失当
    美英法三国专家商量下一步的措施
    据新华社9日讯　伦敦消息：英国工党外交政策发言人罗本斯9月8日抨击保守党政府处理苏彝士运河问题失当。
    罗本斯说，如果来自开罗的关于同纳赛尔举行的会谈未能达成协议的消息属实，那么艾登只好辞职。
    罗本斯警告说，如果使用武力来解决苏彝士问题，这就将“违反联合国宪章”，“使印度和锡兰脱离英联邦，并且使整个阿拉伯世界和亚洲世界团结起来反对我们”。
    罗本斯说，“工党的政策是非常清楚的。英法军队决不可以和埃及开战以实行苏彝士运河的国际化。整个问题应该提交给联合国，而且事实上这个问题应该在一开始的时候就提交到联合国。”
    据新华社9日讯　美、英、法三国中东问题专家9月8日在华盛顿开始会商，讨论在埃及拒绝接受杜勒斯计划的情况下如何确定西方的下一个步骤的问题。
    据合众社消息说，艾登政府目前无意放弃杜勒斯计划中关于使运河国际化的基本原则。伦敦人士传说，英国官方正在考虑的措施之一是加紧对埃及的“经济制裁”。
    有迹象表明，英国还正在改变主意，考虑把苏彝士运河问题提交联合国。
    9月8日“纽约时报”刊载的伦敦电讯说，英国政府的这种改变是受着四个因素的影响。这四个因素是：英国和美国步调不一致；英国工党反对对埃及的强制性的做法；孟席斯使命的失败和英国政府在下一个步骤上举棋不定；认识到英法两国的军事集结不足以保证“迅速的军事决胜”。
