Xinhua News Agency, September 9th, Moscow dispatch from TASS on September 8th: Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Gromyko received the Ambassador of the Federal Republic of Germany to the Soviet Union, Haas, on September 7th. Haas presented Gromyko with a note stating the views of the government of the Federal Republic of Germany on the restoration of German reunification, as well as a memorandum on the matter.

In accepting the aforementioned note, Gromyko stated that the Soviet Union has consistently advocated for the restoration of German national unity, making it a peaceful and democratic nation. The Soviet government's view is that, given the existence of two independent states in Germany at present, there is no realistic path to restoring German unity other than direct negotiations between the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany. This issue cannot be resolved without an agreement between the governments of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany.

Recently, the Federal Republic of Germany has taken measures to militarize the country and undermine the democratic rights and freedoms of the German people, which are guaranteed by the Potsdam Agreement, with the aim of making the restoration of German unity on a peaceful and democratic basis impossible. This cannot be ignored when studying the West German government's note.

Gromyko stated that the Soviet government will respond to the note and memorandum of the government of the Federal Republic of Germany.

    葛罗米柯接见西德大使并发表声明说

    认为西德摧残人民权利旨在使德国的统一成为不可能
    新华社9日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科8日讯：苏联外交部第一副部长葛罗米柯9月7日接见了德意志联邦共和国驻苏联大使哈斯。哈斯把一件陈述德意志联邦共和国政府对恢复德国统一的看法的照会，以及关于这一问题的一份备忘录交给葛罗米柯。
    葛罗米柯在接受上述照会时发表声明说，苏联一贯主张恢复德国的民族统一，使它成为和平和民主的国家。苏联政府的观点是：在目前德国存在有两个自主的国家的情况下，要恢复德国的统一，除了德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国直接谈判之外，没有别的现实的道路。不经德意志民主共和国政府和德意志联邦共和国政府取得协议，这个问题就不可能解决。
    最近在德意志联邦共和国采取了一些措施来使国家军国主义化，摧残受到波茨坦协定保障的德国人民的民主权利和自由，其目的在于使在和平民主基础上恢复德国统一成为不可能。在研究西德政府的照会时也不能不注意到这一点。
    葛罗米柯表示，苏联政府将答复德意志联邦共和国政府的照会和备忘录。
