Xinhua News Agency, 10th, Cairo News: President Nasser's letter of September 9th to Menzies, Chairman of the "Five-Nation Committee," regarding the meetings between Egypt and the Committee on the Suez issue, representing the governments of the eighteen nations participating in the London Conference, is as follows:

Your Excellency,

I have received Your Excellency's letter of September 7, 1956, concerning the meetings we held with the Committee, led by Your Excellency, representing the governments of the eighteen nations participating in the London Conference on the Suez Canal issue.

Your Excellency may recall that during these meetings, I raised several fundamental questions and elaborated on them. Your Excellency mentioned that the eighteen nations represent more than 90% of the canal's users.

Aside from the obvious statistical exaggeration, our understanding of the term "canal users" also includes countries that, while not having ships pass through the canal, use it for the majority of their foreign trade. Examples include Australia, Thailand, Indonesia, India, Pakistan, Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Ethiopia, and Sudan.

Moreover, the principles of sovereignty, ownership, and national dignity are deeply related to this issue. At least on the surface, the starting point of the current crisis was July 26, 1956, when the Egyptian government exercised one of its prerogatives by nationalizing the company known as the "International Suez Canal Company." The Egyptian government has every right to nationalize this Egyptian company, which cannot be seriously contested. When nationalizing this company, the Egyptian government explicitly stated that it considered itself bound by the 1888 Convention guaranteeing freedom of navigation in the Suez Canal and that it was prepared to pay full and fair compensation to the shareholders. Furthermore, on August 12, the Egyptian government announced its willingness to convene a conference with the governments of the signatory nations of the 1888 Constantinople Convention, inviting governments of other nations whose ships pass through the Suez Canal, to review the Constantinople Convention and consider concluding an agreement between all these governments, reaffirming and guaranteeing the freedom of navigation in the Suez Canal.

At the same time, nowhere and at no time can it be found that the Egyptian government has violated any of its international obligations regarding the Suez Canal. Meanwhile, for nearly fifty days, despite the difficulties caused by France, the United Kingdom, and some personnel of the former Suez Canal Company, canal traffic has been normal and efficient.

Therefore, the crisis and the so-called "serious situation" were artificially created by the aforementioned parties. This evidence includes:

	A. Statements containing threats of force,

	B. Mobilization and deployment of troops by France and the United Kingdom,

	C. Incitement by France, the United Kingdom, and certain employees of the former Suez Canal Company for employees and pilots working in the Suez Canal to suddenly abandon their work,

	D. Hostile economic measures against Egypt.

While all these actions were taking place, we repeatedly heard arguments about "peaceful solutions" and "free negotiations" to achieve such a solution. Is it necessary to emphasize the contradiction between the living reality and the openly declared objectives? If there is any blatant violation and disregard for the letter and spirit of the United Nations Charter, it is actions such as attempts at intimidation, economic pressure, and incitement to sabotage.

In stark contrast, the Egyptian government has declared that it is fully willing to negotiate a peaceful solution that conforms to this purpose and the principles of the United Nations Charter. This remains the policy and intention of the Egyptian government.

We have most carefully studied all the proposals made on this issue at and outside the London Conference, including the eighteen-nation proposal made by the Committee. We agree with the aspects affirmed by the eighteen nations, namely that the solution must:

	A. Respect Egyptian sovereignty,

	B. Guarantee freedom of navigation in the Suez Canal according to the October 29, 1888 Convention concerning the Suez Canal,

	C. Respect Egyptian ownership,

	D. Guarantee efficient and reliable navigation, maintenance, and development of the canal.

However, when we consider the methods proposed by the Committee to achieve these objectives, we find that these methods are doomed to failure and lead to results contrary to the original objectives. The "definite system" proposed by the Committee actually means "taking over the operation of the canal," a point that was circulated among the invited governments by the initiating country shortly before the conference and has been consistently insisted upon in substance, albeit with different wording.

The Egyptian people cannot but regard this proposed system as hostile and infringing upon their rights and their sovereignty, all of which hinder genuine cooperation. Moreover, one can also ask, was it the Suez Canal Company that guaranteed the free navigation of the canal? Was it not the Egyptian government that has guaranteed it in the past and continues to guarantee it now? Will the proposed Suez Canal Board guarantee this freedom, or can it actually guarantee this freedom? Is it not to be expected that this Board will be a source of misunderstandings and disputes rather than a source of comfort and benefit?

In short, we constantly remember the extreme importance of genuine international cooperation, which is different from the rule of any one country, whether it is the individual rule that Egypt has just emerged from or the collective rule that the system proposed by this Committee will inevitably be seen as. Attempting to impose such a system will indeed be a signal for inestimable quarrels and will throw the Suez Canal into political turmoil instead of isolating it from politics as the Committee's statement hopes. Whatever the system for operating the canal, it will rely on the close, full, and voluntary cooperation of the Egyptian people, in whose country the canal passes. Obviously, if the people consider the operating organization to be hostile and in violation of their sovereignty, their rights, and their dignity, this indispensable cooperation will be impossible to obtain.

Strangely enough, those who pretend to advocate "isolating" the Suez Canal from politics are precisely those who take many actions that run completely counter to this openly declared objective. What exactly are actions such as internationalizing the Suez Canal, convening a London Conference on the Suez Canal with a mostly selectively invited group of countries, sending a Five-Nation Committee, making threats, deploying armed forces, and taking economic measures—what are all these actions if not political? You mentioned that representatives of any country represented on the proposed Suez Canal Board should not have any obligation to comply with political orders. However, they are still nationals of their respective countries and people of their respective governments, and it is extremely unlikely that they will be unaffected by this relationship. The analogy of international banks and international courts that you have put forward is, in our opinion, both untenable and unconvincing. We believe that the best guarantee for truly isolating the Suez Canal from politics is to make a solemn and internationally binding promise by reaffirming or revising the 1888 Convention. We have said that reaffirming or revising the 1888 Convention is acceptable to us.

It has been insisted that the Egyptian government is attempting to discriminate against one of the countries you represent—namely, the United Kingdom—and that one of the Egyptian government's goals is to undermine the British economy and sever the United Kingdom's trade and supply lines through the Suez Canal.

The undeniably obvious fact is that nothing could be further from the truth than this statement, and no one can present any tenable reason why, or for what beneficial purpose, the Egyptian government would adopt such a policy.

You also mentioned international trust. In this regard, I have drawn your attention to the fact that trust is a two-way street, and although the trust of other countries is important, the trust of the Egyptian people is at least of equal importance in this regard. If the Egyptian people are forced by certain actions and policies to doubt the existence of international justice and lose confidence in the rule of law in international relations, then this trust cannot be obtained.

If the real goal is to guarantee freedom of navigation in the Suez Canal, then the answer is already there: the canal's navigation has always been and continues to be free. The only danger to this freedom of navigation comes from threats involving the deployment of armed forces, inciting workers to sabotage the canal's operation, and taking economic measures against Egypt.

If, on the other hand, as seems to be the case, the goal is to separate a major part of Egypt from Egypt itself, to deprive Egypt of a part of its indivisible territory, then we should be told this goal.

It should now be quite obvious that, by the nature of things, Egypt is not only extremely eager to maintain peace and security around the Suez Canal, but also extremely eager to maintain peace and security in the entire region in which it is located and throughout the world.

It is equally obvious that, even for the sake of self-interest alone, Egypt will resolutely guarantee freedom of navigation through the canal and will be equally resolute in realizing effective, enlightened, and continuously improved operation of the canal, without any discrimination or any concept of exploitation. Regarding this last point, I would like to mention here that I have mentioned to the Committee that the Egyptian government is willing to reach a binding arrangement on the issue of determining fair and reasonable tolls and charges.

As for the future development of the Suez Canal that you mentioned, I would like to reiterate that the Egyptian government is determined to take all possible measures in this regard, and the Egyptian government has announced its intention to implement the development plans that the former canal company had planned to carry out, as well as other plans that are much larger and longer in scale and duration.

It is our publicly declared policy that the Suez Canal Authority should be an independent institution with an independent budget and possessing all necessary powers unrestricted by government regulations and systems. We have also announced that we intend to allocate a substantial portion of the canal's revenue for the canal's future development, and that any revenue needed for this development will not be diverted to other uses. Whether in terms of the canal's development or its management, the Egyptian government is willing and will always be willing to utilize the knowledge and experience of outstanding experts from around the world.

We believe that the crux of the current problem lies in the fact that the purpose of the proposed system itself and the methods attached to it and involved in it is to have some countries that use the canal take over the canal, thereby placing it under their control. A document that was distributed to the countries invited to attend the London Conference shortly before the conference opened, and which seems to date to indicate the goal that the conference's initiating countries still adhere to, reads:

“Regarding the proposal to establish an International Suez Canal Management Agency.

One, France, the United Kingdom, and the United States agree that a draft resolution should be presented at the conference to establish an International Suez Canal Management Agency based on the following principles.

Two, the purpose and authority of the International Management Agency should be:

	(1) To take over the operation of the canal;

	(2) To ensure that it effectively plays its role as a free, open, and secure international waterway in accordance with the 1888 Suez Canal Convention;

Three, to arrange fair compensation for the Suez Canal Company;

Four, to ensure that Egypt receives fair remuneration, taking into account all of Egypt's legitimate rights and interests when paying this remuneration. If an agreement cannot be reached with the Suez Canal Company or Egypt on any of the above last two points, then the matter should be submitted to a three-person arbitration committee appointed by the International Court of Justice.

The constituent bodies of the International Management Agency will include: (1) an Administrative Committee, whose members should be appointed by countries that are mainly involved in the canal's navigation and maritime trade through the canal; (2) necessary technical and administrative bodies.

The powers of the International Management Agency will specifically include: (1) carrying out various necessary works; (2) determining tolls and other charges on a fair and reasonable basis; (3) various financial matters; (4) general administrative and management powers.”

We are convinced that people, after conducting an unbiased study of this document, will only arrive at one view: that its purpose is to take the Suez Canal from Egypt and give it to others. It is difficult to imagine a greater provocation to the Egyptian people than this action. Actions of this nature are not only self-defeating but also of a nature to cause conflict, misunderstanding, and constant disputes. In other words, this will not be the end of the dispute, but the beginning of the dispute.

On the other hand, I would like to reiterate that my government's policy remains: (a) to guarantee freedom of navigation in the Suez Canal, without discrimination, for its safe use; (b) to develop the Suez Canal to meet future navigation needs; (c) to prescribe fair and reasonable tolls and charges; (d) to ensure the technical efficiency of the Suez Canal.

We believe that in this way, the Suez Canal can be detached from politics, no longer a source of conflict, but once again a link of cooperation, mutual benefit, and better understanding between countries on earth. Furthermore, we are deeply convinced that Egypt, by implementing this policy and expressing its goodwill to all parties, will be best able to contribute to the welfare and happiness of the world and to the happiness and welfare of Egypt itself.

### 埃及总统纳赛尔给五国委员会复信

    埃及总统纳赛尔给五国委员会复信
    新华社10日讯　开罗消息：纳赛尔总统9月9日写给“五国委员会”主席孟席斯关于埃及和这个委员会就苏彝士问题举行的会议的复信全文如下：
    阁下：
    我已经收到了阁下1956年9月7日关于我们同以阁下为首的、代表参加讨论苏彝士运河问题的伦敦会议的十八国政府的委员会举行会议的信件。
    阁下的委员会可以想起，在这些会议中，我提出了各项基本问题，并对它们进行了阐释。阁下曾经提到十八国是代表90％以上的运河使用者的。
    撇开这明显的统计方面的夸大不谈，我们对“运河使用者”这个名词的理解是：还包括那些虽然没有船只通过运河，但是却使用运河来进行大部分对外贸易的国家。可以说明这一点的有澳大利亚、泰国、印度尼西亚、印度、巴基斯坦、伊朗、伊拉克、沙特阿拉伯、埃塞俄比亚和苏丹等这些国家。
    而且，主权原则、所有权和国家的尊严都和这个问题有很深的关系。至少从表面上看来，目前危机的起点是1956年7月26日，在那一天，埃及政府行使了它的特权之一，把名为“国际苏彝士运河公司”的公司收归国有。埃及政府完全有权把这个埃及公司收归国有，这是不可能认真提出争论的。埃及政府在把这家公司收归国有的时候曾经明确地说明，它认为它自己是遵守保证苏彝士运河航行自由的1888年公约的，它准备给股东提付充分的和公平的赔偿。而且在8月12日，埃及政府曾经宣布它愿意和1888年君士坦丁堡公约签字国的政府一同召集一次会议，邀请其他有船只通过苏彝士运河的国家的政府参加，以便审查君士坦丁堡公约，并且考虑所有这些国家的政府缔结一个协定，重申和保证苏彝士运河的航行自由的问题。
    和这同时，在任何地方和任何时候都不能找出埃及政府曾经在什么地方或者什么时候违反了它的有关苏彝士运河的任何国际义务。同时，在将近五十天的期间，尽管发生了由法国、联合王国和由前苏彝士运河公司的部分人员所造成的困难，运河的交通一直是正常的和有效率的。
    因此，危机和所谓“严重局势”都是由上述各方面人为地制造出来的，这些证据包括有：
    甲、包含武力威胁的声明，
    乙、法国和联合王国动员和调动军队，
    丙、法国、联合王国以及前苏彝士运河公司的某些职员煽动在苏彝士运河工作的雇员和领航员突然丢下他们的工作，
    丁、对埃及采取敌对的经济措施。
    在所有这些行动都在进行的同时，却一再让我们听取关于“和平解决”以及为了取得这样一种解决的“自由谈判”的种种论调。难道还需要强调活生生的现实和公开宣布的目的之间的矛盾吗？如果有公然违反和蔑视联合国宪章的文字和精神的任何事情的话，那就是像企图恫吓、实行经济压力和煽动进行破坏这一类行动了。
    和这成为鲜明对照的是，埃及政府已经宣布，它完全愿意谈判一个符合这个目的和联合国宪章原则的和平解决办法。现在这仍然是埃及政府的政策和意图。
    我们最仔细地研究了在伦敦会议上和会议外所提出的关于这问题的所有建议，包括这个委员会提出的十八国建议。我们同意十八国所申明的这些方面，即解决的办法必须：
    甲、尊重埃及主权，
    乙、根据1888年10月29日的关于苏彝士运河的公约保证苏彝士运河的通航自由，
    丙、尊重埃及的所有权，
    丁、保证运河有效率的和可靠的通航、保养和发展。
    但是当我们来考虑委员会所建议的达到这些目的的方法时，我们发现这些方法本身就注定了失败，它们引向同原来目的相反的结果。委员会提出的“确定的制度”实际上意味着“接管运河的经营”，这一点在会议前不久由发起国家在被邀请的政府中间传开，并且在实质上始终坚持着，尽管措词有所不同。
    埃及人民不得不把这个建议中的制度看作是敌对的和侵害他们的权利和他们的主权的，而所有这些都是妨碍真正合作的。而且还可以问，难道是苏彝士运河公司保证了运河的自由通航吗？难道不正是埃及政府过去保障了，现在仍然在保障自由通航吗？将由拟议中的苏彝士运河委员会来保障这种自由或者实际上它能够保障这种自由吗？这个委员会将不是快慰和裨益的源泉而是误会和纠纷的源泉，这难道不是意料中的事情吗？
    总之，我们经常记住，真正的国际合作的极端重要性和任何一国的统治是不同的，不管是像埃及刚刚摆脱了的单独的统治也好，还是像这个委员会所建议的制度必然会被看成是集体的统治也好。企图强加这种制度将的确是无法估计的争吵的一种信号，并且将会把苏彝士运河投进政治纷乱中，而不是像这个委员会的声明所希望的那样使它和政治隔绝。不管经营运河的制度将是怎样的，它将要依靠运河通过他们的国家的埃及人民的密切的、充分的和自愿的合作。显然，如果人民认为这个经营组织是敌对的和违反他们的主权、他们的权利和他们的尊严的话，这种不可缺少的合作是不可能得到的。
    奇怪得很，那些假装主张使苏彝士运河同政治“隔绝”的人们，正是采取同这种公开宣布的目的完全背道而驰的许多行动的人。像要把苏彝士运河国际化，召开大部分是经过巧妙选择的被邀请国家参加的关于苏彝士运河的伦敦会议，派遣五国委员会，进行威胁，调遣武装部队，采取经济措施等这些行动到底是什么——所有这些行动如果不是政治又是什么呢？你曾经提到，在建议中的苏彝士运河委员会中派有代表的任何国家的代表不应该有遵守政治命令的任何义务。然而他们毕竟仍然是他们各自国家的国民和他们各自的政府的人民，要他们不受这种关系的影响，那是极端不可能的。你所提出的国际银行和国际法院的比喻，按照我们的意见来看是既站不住脚而且又没有说服力的。我们认为使苏彝士运河同政治真正隔绝的最好的保证，就是通过重申或重新修订1888年公约的方式来作出一种庄严的、在国际上有约束力的诺言。我们已经说过，重申或者重新修订1888年的公约都是我们可以接受的。
    有人硬说埃及政府企图对你们所代表的国家之一——即联合王国实行歧视，又说埃及政府的目的之一是要瓦解英国的经济和切断联合王国通过苏彝士运河的贸易线和供应线。
    无可指摘的明显事实是，没有任何事情比这种说法更加不符合事实的了，也没有任何人能够提出任何站得住的理由来说明埃及政府究竟为什么，究竟为了什么有益的目的会采取这样的政策。
    你也提到了国际信任。在这方面，我已经提请你注意这一点：信任是一种双方面的事，虽然其他国家的信任是重要的，但是埃及人民的信任在这方面至少也具有同等的重要性，如果由于某种行动和政策而使埃及人民被迫对国际公义的存在和国际关系中的法治产生了怀疑并且失去了信心，那么就不可能得到这种信任了。
    如果真正的目的是要保证苏彝士运河的自由通航，那么答案就已经有了，这就是：运河的通航一向是并且继续是自由的。这种通航自由所遭受的唯一危险，是由于以调遣武装部队来进行威胁、煽动职工破坏运河的工作并且对埃及采取经济措施而产生的。
    如果是另外一种情况，看来是这样，目的在于把埃及的主要部分之一从埃及本身割裂开来，目的在于剥夺埃及的不可分割的领土的一部分，那么就应该把这种目的告诉我们。
    现在应该已经十分明显的是，从事情的本质说来，埃及不仅是极其希望维持苏彝士运河周围的和平和安全，而且也是极其希望维持有它所处在的整个地区以及全世界的和平和安全的。
    同样明显的是，即使仅仅为了自我的利益，埃及也会坚决保障通过运河的航行自由，并且也会同样坚决地对运河实现有效、开明和不断进行改进的经营，而不实行任何歧视或任何剥削的这种概念。关于最后一点，我想在这里提一下，我曾经向委员会提到：埃及政府愿意就确定公平合理的通行费和费用的问题达成一项具有约束力的安排。
    至于你们提到的苏彝士运河将来的发展问题，我愿意重申：埃及政府决心要在这方面采取一切可能的办法，并且埃及政府已经宣布过它打算执行前运河公司计划要进行的发展计划，以及规模和期限都要巨大和长远得多的其他计划。
    苏彝士运河管理机构应当是一个具备有独立预算的独立的机构，并且拥有不受政府规定和制度的限制的一切必要的权力，这是我们公开宣布了的政策。我们也已经宣布过，我们打算拨出运河收入中的相当一部分供运河将来发展之用，为进行这种发展所需要的任何收入都不会改用到其他方面去。不论是在运河的发展方面还是运河的管理方面，埃及政府都愿意、而且将永远愿意利用来自全世界各地的优秀专家的知识和经验。
    我们认为，目前问题的症结在于，拟议中的这种制度本身以及它所附带的和它所牵涉的办法的目的都是在于使一部分使用运河的国家接管运河，从而使它受它们的控制。在伦敦会议开会以前不久分发给应邀参加伦敦会议的各国、而看来到目前为止一直是表明着会议发起国目前仍然坚持的目标的那份文件中写道：
    “关于成立苏彝士运河国际管理机构的建议。
    一、法国、联合王国和美国同意，应该提出根据以下几点原则成立苏彝士运河国际管理机构的会议决议草案。
    二、国际管理机构的目的和职权应该是：
    （一）接管运河的经营工作；
    （二）保证它根据1888年苏彝士运河公约有效地发挥它作为一条自由开放和安全的国际水道的作用；
    三、安排给予苏彝士运河公司公平的补偿；
    四、保证使埃及获得公平的报酬，在付给这种报酬的时候，应该考虑到埃及的全部合法权利和利益。如果不能同苏彝士运河公司或者埃及就上述最后两点中任何一点达成协议，那末就应该把问题提交由国际法院任命的三人仲裁委员会。
    国际管理机构的组成机构将有：（一）行政委员会，这个委员会的委员应由同运河的航行和通过运河的海上贸易主要有关国家委任；（二）必要的技术工作机构和行政机构。
    国际管理机构的权力将特别包括：（一）进行各种必要的工作；（二）在公平合理的基础上决定通行费和其他费用；（三）各种财政问题；（四）行政和管理的一般权力。”
    我们确信，人们在对这个文件作毫无偏见的研究以后，只会得到一个看法，那就是：它的目的是要从埃及手中夺走苏彝士运河，而把它交给别人。很难想像有比这个行动更大的对埃及人民的挑衅了。这种性质的行动不仅是自取失败的，同时也是具有引起冲突、误解和不断纠纷的性质的行动。换句话说，这将不是纠纷的结束，而是纠纷的开始。
    另一方面，我愿意重申，我国政府的政策仍然是：（甲）保证苏彝士运河航行自由，对它的安全使用不加歧视；（乙）发展苏彝士运河以满足将来的通航需要；（丙）规定公平合理的通行费和费用；（丁）保证苏彝士运河的技术效率。
    我们相信，这样，苏彝士运河就可以脱离政治，不再是冲突的根源，而再次成为地球上各国之间的合作、互利和更好的了解的一个环节。此外，我们深信，埃及实行这种政策，并向各个方面表示它的善意，将最能够为世界的福利和幸福以及为埃及本国的幸福和福利作出贡献。
