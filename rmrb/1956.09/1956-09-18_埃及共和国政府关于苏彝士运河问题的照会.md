Government of the Republic of Egypt's Note on the Suez Canal Issue

	1. On July 26, 1956, the Egyptian government nationalized the Suez Canal Shipping Company. Egypt took this action entirely in the exercise of its sovereignty, without denying or infringing the rights of any other country.
	At the same time as announcing the nationalization, the Egyptian government also announced its determination to continue to guarantee freedom of navigation in the canal and expressed its willingness to compensate the company's shareholders for the full value of their shares.
	2. Nevertheless, the nationalization action was met with declarations of armed threats from the British and French governments and their measures to mobilize and deploy troops. Hostile economic measures were also adopted against Egypt.
	3. Representatives of France, Britain, and the United States then held meetings in London and issued a joint statement stating that steps should be taken to establish a management arrangement under an international system. To this end, invitations were extended to the governments of twenty-one other countries, including the government of Egypt, to attend a meeting in London on August 16.
	The Egyptian government explained why it was abnormal to attempt to discuss the future of an indivisible part of Egypt without notifying or consulting with Egypt before convening the meeting, and why Egypt could not accept such an invitation.
	4. The records of the meeting held in London from August 16 to August 23, 1956, were submitted to the Egyptian government.
	5. The suggestions made by the Indian government at the meeting on August 24, 1956, were delivered to the Egyptian government by the Indian Embassy in Cairo.
	These suggestions emphasized the need for consultations with Egypt's participation and considered this necessary.
	Later, the governments of Ceylon, Indonesia, and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics notified the Egyptian government of their support for the Indian suggestions. The suggestions themselves were explained by Mr. Menon, Minister of the Indian government, on behalf of the Indian government.
	6. The suggestions made by the United States, Pakistan, Turkey, Iran, and Ethiopia at the London conference, and supported by the governments of thirteen other countries, were delivered to the Egyptian government on September 3, 1956, by a five-nation committee headed by Australian Prime Minister Menzies. Prime Minister Menzies also explained the views of the governments supporting these suggestions.
	The main content of these suggestions was to establish an international, rather than Egyptian, management of the Suez Canal and provided for sanctions.
	The Spanish government's suggestions at the conference were also delivered to the Egyptian government on September 8, 1956.
	7. In addition to the suggestions and explanations mentioned above, the Egyptian government also noted the various other opinions expressed at any time outside the London conference. It is noteworthy that up to now, there has been no direct negotiation with Egypt.
	8. The Egyptian government believes it is necessary to recall that on August 12, 1956, it expressed its willingness to convene a meeting with the governments of other countries that signed the 1888 Constantinople Convention to review the convention and consider concluding an agreement to reaffirm and guarantee freedom of navigation.
	9. It is now willing to declare that it believes ways can be found to resolve the following issues without prejudice to Egypt's sovereignty and dignity:
		A. Freedom and security of navigation in the canal;
		B. Developing the canal to meet future navigation needs;
		C. Setting reasonable and fair tolls and fees.
	It is generally recognized that these issues are of concern to all countries using the Suez Canal, and Egypt, as the sovereign state concerned, naturally shares at least the same concerns.
	The Egyptian government believes that the above issues can and should be resolved through peaceful negotiations.
	10. To this end, the Egyptian government suggests that steps be taken immediately to organize a negotiating body representing the different views of the countries using the Suez Canal, and that discussions should begin immediately to resolve the membership, location, and date of meetings of such a body. This organization could also undertake the task of revising the 1888 Constantinople Convention.
	11. The Egyptian government regrets that some countries are conducting military exercises against Egypt and attempting to induce the canal's technical personnel to leave their jobs in an attempt to obstruct navigation on the Suez Canal.
	Nevertheless, the Egyptian government and people have maintained patience and composure and are determined to keep the canal open.
	12. In stating its belief that solutions can be found and suggesting that these solutions be negotiated, the Egyptian government wishes to state that it is not seeking territory, is not infringing the sovereignty of other countries, is not engaging in discrimination, and points out that it has not engaged in any action with aggressive intent or in violation of treaties, nor has it adopted such a posture.
	The Egyptian government wishes to state its determination to continue its efforts within the letter and spirit of the United Nations Charter to resolve this issue through negotiation.

    埃及共和国政府关于苏彝士运河问题的照会
    1、1956年7月26日，埃及政府对苏彝士运河航运公司实行了国有化。埃及采取这个行动完全是行使它的主权，而没有否认或侵害任何别国的权利。
    埃及政府在宣布国有化的同时，也宣布它决心继续保证运河的通航自由，并表示愿意偿还公司股票持有者的全部股金。
    2、尽管如此，国有化的行动还是遇到了英法两国政府进行武力威胁的声明和它们动员和调动军队的措施。敌视的经济措施也被采用来反对埃及。
    3、法国、英国和美国的代表接着在伦敦举行了会议，并且发表了一项联合声明，声明中说应该采取步骤，建立在国际制度下的一种经营安排，为此，对包括埃及政府在内的，另外二十一个国家的政府发出邀请，请它们参加8月16日在伦敦举行的会议。
    埃及政府对为什么企图讨论埃及不可分割的一个部分的前途，而在召开之前，既没有通知埃及，也没有同埃及商量过的会议是不正常的，以及为什么埃及不能接受这种邀请作了解释。
    4、这个于1956年8月16日到8月23日在伦敦举行的会议的记录曾被提交给了埃及政府。
    5、于1956年8月24日印度政府在会上提出的建议由印度驻开罗大使馆交给埃及政府。
    这些建议强调应该有埃及参加的协商，并且认为这是必要的。
    后来，锡兰、印度尼西亚和苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟等国政府通知埃及政府，它们支持印度的建议。建议本身曾由印度政府的部长梅农先生阁下代表印度政府作了解释。
    6、在伦敦会议上，美国、巴基斯坦、土耳其、伊朗和埃塞俄比亚提出的，并得到其他十三国政府支持的建议已于1956年9月3日由以澳大利亚总理孟席斯阁下为首的五国委员会交给了埃及政府。孟席斯总理并对支持这些建议的各政府的观点作了解释。
    这些建议的主要内容在于对苏彝士运河建立一种国际的、而非埃及的管理并且规定了制裁办法。
    西班牙政府在会议上的建议也已在1956年9月8日送交给埃及政府。
    7、除了以上所述的建议和说明外，埃及政府也注意到了在伦敦会议以外随时表示的其他各种意见。值得注意的是直到现在为止，还没有过同埃及的直接谈判。
    8、埃及政府认为有必要提起在1956年8月12日它表示愿意同签订1888年君士坦丁堡公约的其他国家的政府一道召开一个会议来审查公约和考虑缔结一项协定来重申和保证航行自由。
    9、它现在愿意宣布它认为，可以在不损害埃及的主权和尊严的情况下，找到办法来解决下列问题：
    甲、运河的航行自由和安全；
    乙、发展运河以满足将来航行的需要；
    丙、规定合理和公平的通行税和费用。
    大家公认这些问题是所有使用苏彝士运河的国家都关心的，埃及作为有关的主权国家，自然，至少同样的关心这些问题。
    埃及政府认为可以而且应该设法用和平谈判的办法来解决上述问题。
    10、为了达到这个目的，埃及政府建议立即采取步骤组织一个是以代表使用苏彝士运河的各国的不同意见的谈判机构，而且，应该立即进行讨论来解决这种机构会议的成员、地点和日期问题。这个组织还可以负起修订1888年君士坦丁堡公约的任务。
    11、埃及政府感到遗憾的是某些国家竟举行军事演习来对付埃及，并且力图诱使运河的技术人员离开他们的工作岗位以图阻挠苏彝士运河的通航。
    尽管如此，埃及政府和人民还是保持了耐心和镇定，并且决心使运河畅通无阻。
    12、埃及政府在说明它认为可以找到解决办法的信念，并且建议商谈这些解决办法之时，希望说明：它并不寻求领土，并不侵犯别国的主权，并不进行歧视，并且指出它并没有从事任何有着侵略意图或违反条约的行动，也没有采取这方面的姿态。
    埃及政府希望说明它决心要在联合国宪章的文字和精神的范围内来继续努力，以便用谈判的办法来解决这个问题。
                          1956年9月10日
