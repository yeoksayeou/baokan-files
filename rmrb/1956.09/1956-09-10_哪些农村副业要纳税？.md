    Which Rural Sideline Occupations Should Be Taxed?
    I have something I'm unclear about, which is whether agricultural cooperatives should pay taxes on their sideline occupations. For example, the bricks and tiles fired by agricultural cooperatives, whether used for their own purposes or sold, are subject to an 8% sales tax after leaving the kiln. I don't understand whether agricultural cooperatives should pay tax on operating brick and tile kilns. Even if they should, I'm afraid it shouldn't be that much. Agricultural cooperatives have already paid agricultural tax on the land. Our kiln of bricks and tiles only sells for about 320 yuan, and after deducting the waste products, it's only 280 yuan. If we pay 8% tax, the profit for the agricultural cooperative isn't much. Especially when agricultural cooperatives use it for their own purposes and still have to pay tax, it's incomprehensible. The agricultural cooperative contributes labor, tools, and livestock to process tofu for the People's Liberation Army, handing over 240 jin of tofu for every 100 jin of beans, with no processing fees and no firewood provided. The agricultural cooperative only gets some bean dregs to feed the pigs. But the tax bureau still comes to collect taxes. When we asked them for the tax regulations, they said there are no explicit regulations regarding rural sideline occupations. We want to ask: if there are no explicit regulations, why do you come asking for money?
    I believe that the relevant departments should clarify which sideline occupations run by agricultural cooperatives should be taxed and which should be tax-exempt, and separate sideline occupation tax from commercial tax. In particular, the rural sideline occupation tax rate should be separated from the urban commercial and handicraft tax rates. Otherwise, it will harm the enthusiasm for developing sideline occupations.

### 哪些农村副业要纳税？

    哪些农村副业要纳税？
    我有一件弄不清楚的事情，就是农业社搞副业该不该交税。例如农业社烧的砖瓦，出窑后不管是自用或出卖都得交纳8％的货物税。我不了解农业社经营砖瓦窑是不是该交税。就是该交的话恐怕也不该交那么多。农业社的土地已经交了农业税；我们一窑砖瓦只卖三百二十元左右，除了废品只有二百八十元，如果交8％的税，农业社所得利润没有多少了。特别是农业社自用也交税，那就令人想不通了。农业社出劳力、工具、牲口，为解放军加工豆腐，每百斤豆子交二百四十斤豆腐，没有加工费，也不给柴火，农业社就落点豆渣喂猪。但税务局也要来抽税。我们向他们要纳税条例来看，他们说关于农村副业没有明文规定。我们要问：既没有明文规定，为什么又来伸手要钱呢？
    我认为有关部门应该划清农业社经营的副业哪些该征税，哪些该免税，并把副业税和商业税分别开来，特别是要把农村副业税率和城市商业、手工业税率分开来。不然的话，就会伤害开展副业的积极性。
