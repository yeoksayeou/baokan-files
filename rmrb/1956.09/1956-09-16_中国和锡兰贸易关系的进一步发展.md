Further Development of Trade Relations Between China and Ceylon
Shi Yi

The negotiations between the Ceylonese government delegation headed by K. Corea and the Chinese government delegation on the issue of establishing diplomatic relations have reached an agreement. At the same time, the Ceylonese government has invited a Chinese government trade delegation to visit Ceylon soon to discuss trade matters between the two countries. We can expect new developments in the friendly and trade relations between China and Ceylon.

As early as 1952, China and Ceylon established friendly trade relations. In that year, Ceylon's rubber sales faced difficulties due to American price cuts, and Ceylon urgently needed rice but had difficulty finding sellers. At the same time, China needed rubber. Therefore, based on the principle of mutual benefit, the two governments signed the Sino-Ceylon General Trade Agreement on October 4, 1952, and also signed a five-year rubber-rice exchange agreement in the same year, stipulating that China would supply Ceylon with 270,000 tons of rice annually, and Ceylon would supply China with 50,000 tons of rubber annually within five years.

The signing of the five-year rice-rubber agreement is a good example of economic cooperation between Asian and African countries. The reason why this agreement could be signed and has been successfully implemented for four years is that it was signed based on the principle of equality and mutual benefit, and it is beneficial to the economies of both China and Ceylon. For Ceylon, Ceylon's rubber has obtained a stable market. In the past four years, due to the implementation of the Sino-Ceylon rice-rubber agreement, the Ceylon government has obtained benefits of more than 200 million Ceylon rupees. The Ceylon government used part of the profit as a rubber rejuvenation fund to improve the planting of rubber plantations and increase production, and also used part of the profit to stabilize the domestic rubber price, which has greatly helped Ceylon's rubber production. In addition, Ceylon's economy has also benefited greatly from the guaranteed food supply, which has stabilized people's lives. For China, China obtained a supply of rubber when the United States pressured other countries to implement an "embargo" against China, and China's rubber industry did not encounter difficulties due to a lack of raw materials. At the same time, due to the rice-rubber agreement, China could use rice to exchange for rubber, reducing foreign exchange payments, which is also beneficial to China. Because this agreement is beneficial to the people of both China and Ceylon, it has been supported by the people of both countries.

However, the cause beneficial to the people of China and Ceylon has been met with dissatisfaction from certain third parties. Rubber was considered a strategic material subject to the "embargo" by the United States at that time, and it wanted to force other countries to implement its "embargo" policy. Ceylon, with a population of more than eight million, ignored the artificial obstacles created by the United States for the benefit of its own country and supplied rubber to China for a long time. This was a serious blow to the US "embargo" policy. In a fit of anger, the United States exerted a lot of pressure on Ceylon, threatening and intimidating it in various ways. But it did not scare the people of Ceylon. The Sino-Ceylon rice-rubber agreement has been implemented smoothly. Now that the rubber "embargo" has failed, the US "embargo" policy is collapsing. The people of Ceylon can be even more proud of their victory.

In recent years, the development of trade relations between China and Ceylon has been rapid. Before the founding of the People's Republic of China, Sino-Ceylon trade was almost zero, but today the volume of import and export trade between China and Ceylon ranks second among China's trade with Asian and African countries, second only to Japan. In Ceylon's foreign trade, trade with China ranks third, second only to Britain and India. Therefore, trade between China and Ceylon is very important to the economies of both countries, and it is deeply concerned by the people of both countries.

In the past, Sino-Ceylon trade has developed, but it has been limited to rice and rubber and some other commodities. In fact, Ceylon's abundant coconut oil and spices are all needed by China. China can supply Ceylon with not only rice, but also many light industrial products, local products, food, machinery, etc. The reason why the trade between the two countries has not been able to achieve the greatest possible development is that the two countries have not established diplomatic relations in the past, and China and Ceylon do not have business institutions in each other's countries to manage trade affairs between the two countries. The exchanges between business people from the two countries are also not very frequent. Now we are very pleased to see that Ceylon and China have decided to establish diplomatic relations. This brings a brighter and broader prospect for the development of trade relations between China and Ceylon. In the future, with the joint efforts of the governments and people of the two countries, the friendly and trade relations between China and Ceylon will surely be further developed.

    中国和锡兰贸易关系的进一步发展
    史毅
    以克·科里亚为首的锡兰政府代表团与中国政府代表团关于建交问题的谈判已经达成协议。同时锡兰政府已经邀请中国政府贸易代表团于最近去锡兰商谈两国贸易事宜。我们可以预期中锡两国的友好关系和贸易关系一定会有新的发展。
    中锡两国早在1952年就建立了友好的贸易关系。那一年锡兰的橡胶由于美国的压价，销路感到困难，同时锡兰急需大米又难找到卖主，而中国那时又需要橡胶，因此根据互利的原则，两国政府就在1952年10月4日签订了中锡一般贸易协定，并在同年签订了五年橡胶大米换货协定，规定在五年之内中国每年供应锡兰二十七万吨大米，锡兰每年供应中国五万吨橡胶。
    五年大米橡胶协定的签订，是亚非国家之间经济合作的一个很好的范例。这个协定之所以能够签订，而且四年来能圆满地执行，原因就是它是根据平等互利的原则来签订的，它对中锡两国的经济都是有利的。对锡兰来说，锡兰的橡胶得到了一个稳定的市场。在过去四年，由于执行中锡大米橡胶协定，锡兰政府获得二亿多锡兰卢比的利益。锡兰政府利用一部分利润作为橡胶复兴基金，改善了胶园的种植，增加了产量，另外利用一部分利润来稳定国内橡胶的价格，对锡兰的橡胶生产是有很大的帮助的。此外锡兰由于得到粮食供应的保证，人民的生活得以稳定，对锡兰的经济也有很大好处。对中国来说，在美国压迫其他国家对中国实施“禁运”的时候中国得到了橡胶供应，中国的橡胶工业没有遭到缺乏原料的困难。同时由于大米橡胶协定，中国可以用大米去换取橡胶，减少外汇的支付，对中国也是有利的。正因为这个协定对中锡两国人民都是有利的，所以就得到两国人民的拥护。
    但是，有利于中锡两国人民的事业却遭到某些第三者的不满。橡胶是美国当时认为“禁运”的战略物资，它要强使别的国家执行它的“禁运”政策。八百多万人口的锡兰，为了它本国的利益没有理会美国制造的人为障碍，把橡胶长期地供给中国。这对美国的“禁运”政策是一记严重的打击。美国在恼羞成怒的情绪下，对锡兰施加了不少压力，多方地进行威胁和恐吓。但是它没有吓倒锡兰人民。中锡大米橡胶协定一直顺利地执行着。现在橡胶“禁运”已经破产了，美国“禁运”政策正在瓦解中。锡兰人民更可以为自己的胜利而自豪。
    这几年来，中国和锡兰贸易关系的发展是很快的。中华人民共和国成立以前，中锡贸易几乎等于零，但是今天中国和锡兰的进出口贸易额已经占中国对亚非国家贸易的第二位，仅次于日本。在锡兰的对外贸易中，同中国的贸易额已经占到第三位，仅次于英国和印度。因此，中锡两国的贸易对两国的经济都是很重要的，它受到两国人民深切关怀。
    中锡贸易过去有了发展，但是还是局限于大米和橡胶及其他一些少数商品上。其实锡兰盛产的椰子油和香料等，都是中国所需要的。中国可以供应锡兰的商品不仅有大米，还有很多轻工业品、土产、食品、机器等。两国的贸易没有能得到最大可能的发展，原因是两国过去没有建立外交关系，中国和锡兰在对方都没有商务机构经管两国的贸易事务。两国工商业人士的来往也不是很频繁。现在我们很高兴地看到锡兰和中国已经决定建交了。这给中锡两国的贸易关系的发展带来更光明更广阔的前景。今后在两国政府和人民的共同努力下，中国和锡兰的友好关系和贸易关系一定会得到进一步的发展。
