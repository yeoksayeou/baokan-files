Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, September 1st: Tianjin's state-owned cotton textile industry has completed its first Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. As of August 31st, the total output value, cotton yarn, and cotton cloth production have all reached the 1957 production levels. Labor productivity has already exceeded the 1957 targets. The cumulative cost reduction rate of comparable products reached the 1957 target as early as July.

During the implementation of the Five-Year Plan, the quality of cotton yarn and cotton cloth in Tianjin's state-owned cotton textile industry has significantly improved. In this year's competition focused on improving product quality and trial-manufacturing new products, the first-grade yarn produced by these cotton textile factories, on average, exceeded the national standards. From January to July this year, the percentage of superior and first-class cotton cloth reached 99.41%, exceeding the national plan by 1.16%.

To continuously meet consumer needs, various textile factories have also successively trial-produced many new products. In the first half of this year alone, they produced and trial-manufactured 28 new varieties, such as checkered yarn, crepe, and herringbone twill. In 1953, these state-owned cotton textile factories could only produce seven types of cotton cloth woven with medium-count yarn. Now, 60-count high-grade yarn, which has not been produced since liberation, is also being produced in large quantities.

    天津市国营棉纺织工业
    一等纱超过了国家规定指标
    新华社天津1日电　天津的国营棉纺织工业提前完成了第一个五年计划。截至8月31日止，总产值、棉纱和棉布产量都达到1957年的生产水平；劳动生产率已经超过了1957年的指标；可比产品的累计成本降低率，早在7月份就达到1957年的指标。
    在执行五年计划期间，天津市国营棉纺织工业的棉纱和棉布质量都有了显著提高。在今年的提高产品质量和试制新产品为中心的竞赛中，这些棉纺织厂生产的一等一级纱，平均超过了国家规定的指标。从今年1月份到7月份，棉布的上等品和一等品率达到99.41％，超过国家计划1.16％。
    为了不断满足消费者的需要，各纺织厂还先后试制了许多新产品，其中只在今年上半年，就生产和试制了方格纱、皱纹呢、人字呢等二十八种新品种。而在1953年，这些国营棉纺织厂还只能生产七种用中支纱织成的棉布。现在，解放以来从没有生产过的六十支高级纱，也在大量生产了。
