Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The first 1-5-1 large freight locomotive designed and manufactured in our country has been successfully trial-produced at the Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Plant.

On the 18th, the locomotive departed from the factory and gradually increased its speed from 15 kilometers per hour to 70 kilometers per hour, traveling back and forth 140 kilometers along the Dalian-Beijing line. The locomotive's designers, engineers, and the workers who personally manufactured the locomotive carefully inspected and studied each part they designed and manufactured during the journey. According to the inspection results, the locomotive ran very well, and no abnormal phenomena were found in any part of the locomotive when it reached 70 kilometers per hour.

The traction force of this new type of locomotive is 80% greater than that of the 冖ㄎ1 type freight locomotive commonly used on our country's railways. It can travel at 39 kilometers per hour on a 4‰ gradient while carrying 2,800 tons (the 冖ㄎ1 type locomotive can only travel at 20 kilometers per hour with the same load). The new locomotive saves 12% of coal per 10,000 ton-kilometers; the metal consumption per horsepower is reduced by 28.5%.

The new locomotive widely uses mechanized equipment to replace heavy manual labor. The stoker of this locomotive only needs to watch the instrument and lightly move the automatic coal feeding device, and the coal can be evenly fed into the furnace. The new locomotive also has automatic oilers, pneumatic rocking machines, and other new equipment. The driver's cab is very spacious, well-lit, and has insulation and warming devices.

The design of this new type of locomotive began in January of last year. Under the guidance of Soviet experts, the designers, engineers, and workers of the new locomotive spent only one year and eight months from design to completion of manufacturing.

Workers from more than a dozen factories, including the No. 3 Steel Plant of the Shanghai Iron and Steel Company, the Seamless Steel Pipe Plant of Anshan Iron and Steel, and the Tianjin Vehicle Spring Factory, manufactured high-quality parts for this new type of locomotive.

### 我国设计的新型机车试制成功  这种机车采用机械化设备，牵引力大，速度快

    我国设计的新型机车试制成功
    这种机车采用机械化设备，牵引力大，速度快
    新华社讯　我国设计和制造的第一辆1—5—1大型货运机车，在大连机车车辆制造工厂试制成功。
    18日上午，这辆机车从工厂开出，用每小时十五公里的慢速逐渐加大到七十公里的速度，沿着大连到北京的线路往返运行了一百四十公里。这辆机车的设计师、工程技术人员和亲手制造这台机车的工人们，在行驶途中都对自己设计和制造的部件，一一做了仔细检查和研究。根据检查结果，这辆机车行驶情况很好，在每小时达到七十公里的时候，机车的各个部分都没有发现不正常的现象。
    这辆新型机车，比我国目前铁路上普遍使用的冖ㄎ1型货运机车的牵引力大80％。它在千分之四的坡道上载重两千八百吨，每小时可以行驶三十九公里（冖ㄎ1型机车载重同样的数量，每小时只能走二十公里）。新机车每万吨公里省煤12％；每马力的金属消耗量，减少28.5％。
    在新机车上普遍采用了机械化设备，代替了繁重的体力劳动。这个机车的司炉工人只要看着仪表，手轻轻地拨动自动加煤装置，煤就可以均衡地被送入炉膛。新机车上还有自动加油机、风动摇炉机等多种新设备。司机室十分宽敞，光线很好，并且有保暖保温装置。
    这辆新型机车是去年1月开始设计的。新机车的设计师、工程师和工人们在苏联专家的指导下，从设计到制造完成，一共只用了一年零八个多月的时间。
    上海钢铁公司第三钢厂、鞍钢无缝钢管厂、天津车辆弹簧厂等十几个工厂的工人，都为这个新型机车制造了质量优良的部件。
