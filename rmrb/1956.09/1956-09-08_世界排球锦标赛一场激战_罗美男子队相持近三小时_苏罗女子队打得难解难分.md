Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 7th: Paris dispatch: In the World Volleyball Championship finals held on the 6th, the Romanian men's team defeated the American team. Their match was the longest, taking two hours and forty-eight minutes to determine the winner.

    In the first game, the Romanian team won 15-12. The American team then won the next two games 15-10 and 15-13. The Romanian team won the fourth game 15-8. At this point, each side had won two games, so the fifth game was very tense, going all the way to 21-19 before the Romanian team won. This score is the highest record so far in volleyball matches.

    In the women's group finals, the match between the Soviet team and the Romanian team was equally hard-fought. The Romanian team has been improving in each match. In the first two games, their spikes were wonderful, their counterattacks and attacks were well-arranged, and their defense was tight. Therefore, despite all the efforts of the defending champion Soviet team, they were in a difficult situation. The scores of these two games were 15-12 and 15-11, with the Romanian team taking the lead. The situation changed in the third game. The Soviet team did not give the somewhat chaotic Romanian team a chance to breathe, and played all the way to 13-2, finally winning the third game 15-6. In the fourth game, the Soviet team led 4-0 and 9-2, but the Romanian team played with great courage to tie the score at nine, and even took a 10-9 lead at one point. However, due to lack of physical strength, the Soviet team won the fourth game 15-12. Later, the Soviet team won the fifth game 15-8.

    In the men's group finals, the Polish team defeated the Hungarian team 3-0, the Soviet team defeated the Yugoslav team 3-0, the Czechoslovak team defeated the French team 3-0, and the Bulgarian team defeated the Chinese team 3-0.

    In the women's group finals, the Polish team defeated the American team 3-0, the East German team defeated the Dutch team 3-1, the Bulgarian team defeated the Korean team 3-0, and the Czechoslovak team defeated the Chinese team 3-0.

    世界排球锦标赛一场激战
    罗美男子队相持近三小时
    苏罗女子队打得难解难分
    新华社布拉格7日电　巴黎消息：在6日的世界排球锦标赛各组决赛中，罗马尼亚男子队战胜了美国队。他们比赛的时间最长，花了二小时四十八分钟才分出胜负。
    比赛第一局，罗马尼亚队以15∶12胜。美国队接着以15∶10和15∶13连胜两局。第四局罗马尼亚队又以15∶8获胜。这时双方各胜两局，因此，第五局比赛进行得十分紧张，一直打到21∶19罗马尼亚队才获胜。这个比数是排球赛开始到现在为止最高的纪录。
    在女子组决赛中，苏联队对罗马尼亚队的比赛同样处于难解难分的状态。罗马尼亚队在每次比赛中都有进步，在头两局中，她们扣球很精彩，反击和进攻也都安排得很好，防守得又严密，因此，尽管上届冠军苏联队尽了一切努力，还是陷于困难的境地。这两局的比数是15∶12和15∶11，罗马尼亚队占先。第三局局势起了变化，苏联队不让显得有些混乱的罗马尼亚队有喘息的机会，一直打到13∶2，最后以15∶6赢得第三局。第四局苏联队以4∶0，9∶2领先，但是罗马尼亚队以极大的勇气打到九平，而且一度以10∶9领先，但是，由于体力不济，被苏联队以15∶12胜第四局。后来，苏联队又以15∶8胜第五局。
    在男子组的决赛中，波兰队以3∶0胜匈牙利队，苏联队以3∶0胜南斯拉夫队，捷克斯洛伐克队以3∶0胜法国队，保加利亚队以3∶0胜中国队。
    在女子组决赛中，波兰队以3∶0胜美国队，民主德国队以3∶1胜荷兰队，保加利亚队以3∶0胜朝鲜队。捷克斯洛伐克队以3∶0胜中国队。
