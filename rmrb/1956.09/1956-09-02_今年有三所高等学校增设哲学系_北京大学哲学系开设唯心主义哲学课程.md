Three Universities Establish Philosophy Departments This Year; Peking University Philosophy Department Offers Courses on Idealist Philosophy

(Reported by our newspaper) Renmin University of China, Wuhan University, and Fudan University in Shanghai have all established philosophy departments starting from the first semester of this academic year.

The Philosophy Department of Renmin University of China was established on the basis of the original philosophy teaching and research section. The Philosophy Department is divided into four teaching and research sections: Dialectical Materialism, History of Philosophy, Logic, and Foundations of Natural Science. This year, a philosophy major is temporarily set up. The first academic year will cover courses such as Political Economy, Dialectical Materialism, Logic, World History, and Foundations of Natural Science. The department also plans to recruit ten postgraduate students this year.

The newly established Philosophy Department of Wuhan University is headed by Li Da, the president of Wuhan University, concurrently. This year, a philosophy major will be established first, teaching courses such as Dialectical Materialism, Logic, Foundations of Natural Science, and World General History.

The Philosophy Department of Fudan University was expanded from the school's original Dialectical Materialism and Historical Materialism teaching and research group. Most of the teachers are original, and some teachers are supported by brother schools. This year, the department has three teaching and research sections: Dialectical Materialism and Historical Materialism, and History of Philosophy—Logic. (Ai Jing)

In other news, the Foreign Philosophy History Teaching and Research Section of the Philosophy Department of Peking University has decided to add a special course on idealism starting this academic year: The first semester will feature "Russell's Philosophy," taught by Professor Jin Yuelin; the second semester will feature "Hegel's Philosophy," taught by Professor He Lin. In addition, Professor Zheng Xin, the head of the department, has accepted an invitation from Renmin University and will teach "Kant's Philosophy" to the faculty of the university's Philosophy Department next semester. The Foreign Philosophy History Teaching and Research Section of Peking University is also preparing to add courses on "Aristotle's Philosophy," "Kant's Philosophy," and courses related to positivism and neo-positivism after the summer vacation next year.

The offering of specialized courses on idealism in universities is a concrete manifestation of implementing the "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom" policy. In the past, teachers often did not dare to explain the content of idealist philosophy when lecturing, and the criticisms were also very general. Students had to memorize some comments and conclusions. This was not only unfavorable to cultivating students' ability to fight against idealism, but also failed to give full play to the expertise of teachers. Adding specialized courses on idealism will provide a systematic and detailed introduction to the content of idealist philosophy itself. This will undoubtedly help improve students' critical abilities and cultivate their ability to fight against idealism. (Zhang Shiying)

    今年有三所高等学校增设哲学系
    北京大学哲学系开设唯心主义哲学课程
    本报讯　中国人民大学、武汉大学和上海复旦大学，从今年度第一学期开始增设了哲学系。
    中国人民大学哲学系是在原来的哲学教研室的基础上建立的。哲学系分设辩证唯物主义、哲学史、逻辑学、自然科学基础等四个教研室。今年暂设一个哲学专业。第一学年将讲授政治经济学、辩证唯物主义、逻辑、世界史、自然科学基础等课程。该系今年并拟招收副博士研究生十人。
    新成立的武汉大学哲学系，由武汉大学校长李达兼任系主任。今年先设哲学专业，讲授辩证唯物主义、逻辑学、自然科学基础、世界通史等课程。
    复旦大学哲学系是由该校原辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义教研组扩建而成，绝大部分教师是原有的，部分师资由兄弟学校支援。该系今年设辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义、哲学史—逻辑学等三个教研室。

    又讯　北京大学哲学系外国哲学史教研室决定从本学年起增设关于唯心主义的专门课程：第一学期将开“罗素哲学”，由金岳霖教授讲授；第二学期将开“黑格尔哲学”，由贺麟教授讲授。此外，系主任郑昕教授已应人民大学之请，将于下学期为该校哲学系教师讲授“康德哲学”。北大外国哲学史教研室并预备在明年暑期以后增开
  “亚里斯多德哲学”、“康德哲学”以及有关实证论与新实证论方面的课程。
    在高等学校中开设关于唯心主义的专门课程，这是贯彻“百家争鸣”方针的一个具体表现。过去，教师们在讲课时对于唯心主义哲学往往不敢讲明它的内容，批判也很一般化，学生只好死记一些评语结论。这不但不利于培养学生同唯心主义作斗争的能力，而且也不能充分发挥教师的专长。增设关于唯心主义的专门课程，将对唯心主义哲学的内容本身作系统、详细的介绍，这样，对于提高学生批判能力，培养学生与唯心主义作斗争的本领，无疑是有帮助的。　（张世英）
