Xinhua News Agency, September 13th, Cairo dispatch: The Director-General of the Egyptian Suez Canal Authority, Younis, said on September 12 that no matter how many foreign pilots and employees resign, Egypt will still keep the navigation of the canal open.

    The former Suez Canal Company has issued a notice requesting, and using money to induce, non-Egyptian pilots and staff working in the Suez Canal to resign before the 15th.

    Younis said that Egypt has made arrangements to deal with this contingency.

    Younis said: "Egypt will abide by its promise when nationalizing the Suez Canal - navigation will never be hindered. We are prepared not only to deal with the resignation of foreign pilots and employees, but also to deal with the worst possible scenarios."

    Younis said: "Anyone who wants to resign is free to leave, and no legal action will be taken to prevent them from leaving."

    According to the Associated Press, there are an estimated one hundred and forty-six people currently working on the canal, and about one hundred are planning to resign. These one hundred and forty-six people guide an average of forty to forty-six ships through the canal each day in three teams.

    The Middle East News Agency reported that "Egyptian officials said that this action by pilots and employees was instigated by the British and French governments with the aim of hindering navigation of the Suez Canal, and therefore this action should be considered a violation of the convention signed in 1888."

    Egyptian officials said: "This action shows that although Egypt respects international agreements, Britain and France do not respect them."

    埃及不怕英法引诱非埃籍领航员离职  决心应付一切可能发生的最糟的情况
    据新华社13日讯　开罗消息：埃及苏彝士运河管理局总经理尤尼斯9月12日说，不管有多少外国领航员和雇员离职，埃及仍然要使运河的航行畅通。
    前苏彝士运河公司已经发出通知要求，并且用金钱引诱在苏彝士运河工作的非埃及籍的领航员和职员在15日以前离职。
    尤尼斯说，埃及已经作了应付这种万一情况的安排。
    尤尼斯说：“埃及将遵守它在把苏彝士运河收归国有时所许的诺言——航行将永远不会遭到阻拦。我们准备不仅要应付外国领航员和雇员的离职，并且还要应付一切可能发生的最糟的情况”。
    尤尼斯说：“任何想要离职的人都有离开的自由，将不会采取任何阻止他们离职的法律行动”。
    据美联社报道，目前在运河上工作的估计有一百四十六人，而计划离职的约有一百人。这一百四十六人每天分三队引导平均四十到四十六只船通过运河。
    中东通讯社报道，“埃及的负责人士说，领航员和雇员的这种行动是英法政府鼓动的，目的是要阻挠苏彝士运河的航行，因此应该认为这种行动违反了1888年签订的公约”。
    埃及官方人士说：“这个行动表明，尽管埃及尊重国际协定，但是英国和法国却不尊重”。
