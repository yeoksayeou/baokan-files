    Pay Attention to the Production of Mountain Walking Plows
    I am a staff member of the Production Materials Wholesale Station of the Pingwu County Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Sichuan. After the agricultural cooperative movement entered its climax, I often heard farmers in mountainous areas requesting the supply of new agricultural tools. However, our supply and marketing cooperatives can generally only supply new agricultural tools such as double-wheeled double-furrow plows and double-wheeled single-furrow plows. These agricultural tools are not very suitable for use in mountainous areas. According to statistics, our county alone needs more than 5,000 mountain walking plows, but we cannot find a source of supply. I hope that relevant departments will pay attention to the manufacturing of mountain walking plows. 　　　　　　Wu Boxun

    注意生产山地步犁
    我是四川平武县供销合作社生产资料批发站的一个工作人员。农业合作化运动进入高潮以后，我经常听到山区农民要求供应新式农具。但是，我们供销合作社一般只能供应双轮双铧犁、双轮一铧犁等新式农具。这些农具在山区使用不太合适。据统计，我们县就需要五千多部山地步犁，但是我们找不到货源。希望有关部门重视山地步犁的制造工作。　　　　　　吴伯勋
