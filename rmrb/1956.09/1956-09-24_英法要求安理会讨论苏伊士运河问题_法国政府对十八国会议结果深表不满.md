Xinhua News Agency, September 23rd dispatch from Paris: The French Foreign Ministry announced on September 23rd that the British and French governments have written to the President of the United Nations Security Council, requesting that a Security Council meeting be convened on September 26th to discuss the Suez Canal issue.

Xinhua News Agency, September 23rd dispatch from Paris: The French government, which insists on "not accepting any compromise," is deeply dissatisfied with the outcome of the eighteen-nation London conference and calls the "Users' Association" established by the conference's decision a "Users' Club."

A communiqué issued after a special meeting of the French cabinet on September 22nd stated that the French cabinet is "determined to respect the principles of international management of the canal as determined at the first London conference and will not accept any compromise on this issue. It is with this clear reservation that France will express its support for the Users' Club."

The communiqué said, "The French government regrets that some countries in this club have reserved for themselves freedoms that are difficult to reconcile with the principle of solidarity determined by the eighteen nations." The communiqué stated: "The French government considers it necessary to declare that, in this situation, France intends to retain its freedom of action and refuse to assist in the implementation of any measures it may deem contrary to its fundamental interests and contrary to the objectives previously determined by the eighteen nations."

Numerous reports indicate that the French government's dissatisfaction with the outcome of the eighteen-nation London conference stems from its belief that the conference did not stipulate clear obligations to be undertaken by the participating countries. French Foreign Minister Pineau mentioned on the 21st that establishing a "Users' Association" according to the conference declaration had certain "disadvantages" for France. He believed that the conference gave member countries of the association too much freedom, especially in terms of paying canal tolls.

Xinhua News Agency, September 23rd dispatch from Washington: US Secretary of State Dulles issued a statement on September 22nd after returning to Washington from the eighteen-nation London conference.

In his statement, Dulles boasted about the "cooperation" of the eighteen nations at the meeting and the "very good partnership spirit" among them, insisting that the eighteen-nation conference "achieved solid results."

Dulles once again rejected Egypt's proposal to hold an expanded international conference.

Dulles deliberately expressed optimism about the future, saying: "The door to a peaceful and just solution to the problem is open, provided that the Egyptian government chooses this path."

    英法要求安理会讨论苏伊士运河问题
    法国政府对十八国会议结果深表不满
    据新华社23日讯　巴黎消息：法国外交部9月23日宣布，英法两国政府已经写信给联合国安全理事会主席，要求在9月26日召开安全理事会会议讨论苏伊士运河问题。
    据新华社23日讯　巴黎消息：坚持“不接受任何折衷办法”的法国政府对十八国伦敦会议的结果深表不满，并且把这个会议决定建立的“使用国协会”叫做“使用国俱乐部”。
    法国内阁在9月22日举行特别会议以后发表公报说，法国内阁“决心尊重在第一次伦敦会议上所确定的国际管理运河的原则和在这个问题上不接受任何折衷办法。正是在这种明显的保留态度下，法国将对使用国俱乐部表示支持。”
    公报说，“法国政府对某些国家竟然在这个俱乐部内为自己保留很难同十八国所确定的团结一致原则相调和的自由，表示遗憾”。公报说：“法国政府认为有必要声明：在这种情况下，法国打算保留它的行动自由和拒绝协助实行任何它可能认为违反它的基本利益和违反十八国以前所确定的目标的措施。”
    许多消息说明，法国政府所以对伦敦十八国会议的结果感到不满，是因为它认为会议没有规定与会国需要承担的明确义务。法国外交部长比诺21日就曾经谈到按照会议宣言建立“使用国协会”，对法国的某些“不利的地方”。他认为这次会议给协会成员国过多的自由，特别是在缴纳运河通行费方面。
    据新华社23日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务卿杜勒斯9月22日从伦敦回到华盛顿后就十八国伦敦会议发表声明。
    杜勒斯在声明中吹嘘十八国在会上的“合作”和它们之间的“非常好的伙伴精神”，硬说十八国会议“取得了稳固的成就”。
    杜勒斯再次表示拒绝埃及关于举行扩大的国际会议的建议。
    杜勒斯故意对前途表示乐观，他说：“和平而公正地解决问题的大门是敞开着的，只要埃及政府选择这条道路。”
