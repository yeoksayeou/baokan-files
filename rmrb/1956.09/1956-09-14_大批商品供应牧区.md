　　Xinhua News Agency, Qabqa, 8th. The peak trading season has arrived in the pastoral areas of Qinghai Province. In the past two months, more than 500 tons of goods have been transported to Qabqa, the largest grassland market in the Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Qinghai Province. In addition to grain, tea, cloth, food, and various daily necessities, this batch of goods also includes Tibetan boots, Tibetan hats, pulu, hada, ivory bracelets, coral necklaces, cow dung stoves, silver butter lamps, and other goods popular among the Tibetan people.
　　This year, the trading companies and supply and marketing cooperatives in Qabqa have attached importance to the supply of goods specially needed by ethnic minorities, and the variety of goods managed has nearly doubled compared with previous years. Trading companies and supply and marketing cooperatives often pay attention to collecting new requirements for goods from Tibetan customers in the stores, and use the opportunity of ethnic minority cadres going to the countryside and returning home to visit relatives to collect new styles of 20 or 30 kinds of ethnic products. At the same time, they have also increased the number of Tibetan purchasers sent to Xining to purchase goods.

    大批商品供应牧区
    新华社恰卜恰8日电青海省牧业区已进入贸易旺季。最近两个月来，有五百多吨货物运到了青海省海南藏族自治州最大的草原市场——恰卜恰。这批货物中除了粮食、茶叶、布匹、食品和各种日用品以外，还有藏族人民喜爱的藏靴、藏帽、氆氇、哈达、象牙手镯、珊瑚珠项圈、牛粪炉灶、银质酥油灯等商品。
    今年，恰卜恰的贸易公司和供销社重视了对少数民族特需商品的供应工作，经营品种比往年增加了将近一倍。贸易公司和供销社经常注意从门市上搜集藏族顾客对商品的新要求，并利用民族干部下乡和回家省亲的机会，搜集了二、三十种民族用品的新式样，同时还增派了到西宁办货的藏族采购员。
