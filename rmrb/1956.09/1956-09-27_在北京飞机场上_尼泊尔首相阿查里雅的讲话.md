At Beijing Airport
Speech by Nepalese Prime Minister Acharya

Your Excellency, Ladies and Gentlemen:

I have heard before that the Chinese people are world-renowned for their hospitality. The grand reception I received today, the warm welcome expressed on the faces of the people around me, and the hospitality I have received since arriving in China, have not only concretely confirmed everything I had heard before, but have also deeply moved me. I find it difficult to express in words my feelings for this undoubted friendship, affection and respect you have shown me. Therefore, I can only say to you: Thank you.

The Chinese revolution of our time has attracted worldwide attention. But it is the rise of China and the awakening of the Chinese people that has had a profound impact on the people of Asia. Therefore, I have come to your country to see for myself what I have heard from friends and other sources about all that new China has done in the way of great national construction and the great achievements in national development in just a few years.

The historical friendship between our two countries, China and Nepal, can be traced back to ancient times. If we put aside some myths or other less scientific, that is, less reliable stories, and only talk about written historical records, we will see that our friendship has lasted for one thousand five hundred years or more. We must thank Sakyamuni for the continuation and development of such a noble tradition of friendship over such a long period. The people of both our countries regard Sakyamuni as the angel of peace. At the same time, we should also thank Xuanzang and Faxian, as well as Manjushri and Araniko, who helped their countries to absorb the noblest and best things from each other in terms of religion, art and culture.

Like other things of human value, friendship, goodwill, cultural exchange and economic cooperation must be cultivated in a way that is appropriate to the spirit of the times, from generation to generation, so that their development can be as free and unhindered as the flags of our two countries flying peacefully side by side in the clear blue autumn sky before us. Our ancestors have completed their tasks, and the precious friendship they have left us is a silent but eloquent testimony. The task of our generation is to continue their unfinished work, to consolidate and strengthen our mutual traditional care and love, and our expectations of mutual friendly help and cooperation.

Nepal has always been a peace-loving country, and sincerely hopes that its neighbors will enjoy well-being and prosperity. I have mentioned the efforts made by Sakyamuni through his sermons on non-violence and kindness to all living beings. Speaking of modern times, I especially remember the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence mentioned in the Sino-Nepalese Friendship Agreement and other similar efforts made by Nepal to ease international tensions. I believe that China and Nepal can work together to promote world peace by increasing better mutual understanding between countries. Because both of our countries are engaged in large-scale national construction, both of our countries realize that national construction of any scale is impossible unless there is a world peace environment, and only through international mutual understanding can world peace be promoted, and only in a peaceful environment can countries exchange what they have in economic and cultural aspects.

The friendship between China and Nepal, two sovereign states, not only contributes to the prosperity of our two countries, is not only mutually beneficial in terms of politics, economy, art and culture, but also has a broader significance, that is, it helps to maintain world peace, and it is also a step to bring the ideal of world peace closer to complete realization.

On this happy and solemn occasion, as old friends reunite, let us pledge, or rather, let us rededicate ourselves to the cause of friendship and goodwill between our two countries, as part of the friendship and goodwill of all countries in the world. Let us work together continuously so that in countless years to come, this spirit will always be a living reality.

Long live Sino-Nepalese friendship!

### 在北京飞机场上  尼泊尔首相阿查里雅的讲话

专栏：

    在北京飞机场上
    尼泊尔首相阿查里雅的讲话阁下，女士们，先生们：
    我以前听说过中国人以好客闻名于世界。今天对我这样盛大的接待，在我周围人们脸上所表示的热烈欢迎，以及我一到中国就受到的款待，除了具体地证实了我以前所听到的一切以外，也同时使我深深的感动。对于你们向我表达的这种无可怀疑的友谊、爱戴和敬意，我很难用语言来表达出我的感情。因此，我只能向你们说：谢谢。
    我们这个时代的中国革命吸引了全世界的注意力。但是，给亚洲人民很深的影响的是中国的兴起和中国人民的觉醒。因此，我来到了贵国，亲自看看我从朋友们和其他来源所听到的关于新中国在短短几年中，在巨大的国家建设上所作的一切和国家发展方面的巨大的成就。
    存在于我们中尼两国的历史的友谊可以追溯到很古的年代。如果我们不谈一些神话或其他一些不大科学、也就是说不大可靠的故事，而只谈有成文的历史的记载，我们就会看到我们的友谊已经有一千五百年或更长一些。我们这样高贵的传统友谊在这样长时间内得以继续和发展，在这一点上我们要感谢释迦牟尼。我们两国人民都认为释迦牟尼是和平的天使。同时，我们也要感谢玄奘和法显，以及文殊和阿尼哥，他们曾经帮助自己的国家在宗教、艺术和文化各方面从对方吸取最高贵和最好的东西。
    正如其他具有人类价值的东西一样，友谊、善意、文化交流和经济合作必须按照一种适合于时代精神的方式加以培养，从一个世代到一个世代，以便它们的发展能够像我们两国的国旗在我们面前紧靠在一起和平地在秋天蓝色的明朗的天空中飘舞一样的自由和不受阻挠。我们的祖先已经完成了他们的任务，他们给我们遗留下来的宝贵友谊是一个无声的但是雄辩的证明。我们这一代的任务就是重新继续他们未完的工作，来巩固并加强我们相互的传统的关怀和友爱，以及对互相友好帮助和合作的期望。
    尼泊尔向来是一个爱好和平的国家，它诚恳地希望它的各个邻国享有福利和繁荣。我已经提到过释迦牟尼通过他关于不使用暴力和仁慈对待一切生灵的布道所作的努力。谈到现代，我特别想起中国和尼泊尔的友好协定中所提到的和平共处五项原则和尼泊尔为了缓和国际紧张局势所作的其他类似的努力。我相信中国和尼泊尔能够一起通过增进国家之间的更好的互相了解来促进世界和平。因为我们两国都在从事大规模的国家建设，我们两国都体会到除非在世界和平的环境下，任何规模的国家建设都是不可能的，而只有通过国际间的相互了解才能促进世界和平，也只有在和平的环境中才能在国家之间在经济和文化方面互通有无。
    中国和尼泊尔两个主权国家间的友谊不仅有助于我们两国的繁荣，不仅是在政治、经济、艺术和文化方面互相有利，而且还有更广泛的意义，即它有助于维护世界和平，它也是一个使世界和平的理想更接近于完全实现的一个步骤。
    在这个愉快而庄严的场合，在老朋友们重新相聚在一起的时候，让我们保证、或更进一步让我们重新献身于作为世界各国的友好和善意的一部分的我们两国之间的友好和善意的事业。让我们一起不断地努力，以便在今后的无数年代里，这种精神将永远成为一种活生生的现实。
    中尼友好万岁！（附图片）
