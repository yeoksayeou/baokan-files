    The Most Important Way to Overcome Natural Disasters
    Starting from the end of May this year, some areas have successively experienced severe floods, typhoons, and droughts. From a national perspective, this year's disaster situation is not as severe as the 1954 floods, and it is estimated that the total grain output can still increase compared to last year. However, the severity of the disaster in provinces such as Hebei and Henan has exceeded that of 1954, and the floods in Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces are also more severe than the worst disaster since the liberation of the Northeast in 1953. Crops in the disaster areas will be reduced to varying degrees.
    After the disasters occurred, the people and staff in the affected areas made their best efforts and carried out rescue work bravely and intensively, greatly reducing the losses. Many places, after successfully completing the emergency rescue work, launched regular and planned production self-rescue activities and made considerable achievements. They put forward the slogan of "reducing production but not reducing income," striving to "make up" for the losses suffered in the disaster, and "find back" what was lost from the fields, from the water, and from the mountains, full of confidence in overcoming the disaster.
    It is undeniable that among some staff and farmers in the disaster areas, there is currently a mentality of simply relying on external assistance and depending on state relief. Under the influence of this thinking, the specific work of organizing and leading the people in the disaster areas to engage in production for self-rescue is naturally relaxed.
    Indeed, the state is doing its utmost to support the people in the disaster areas. This year, the state's material and financial resources for disaster relief are more than in any previous year. In the future, the state will definitely continue to provide support to the disaster areas, which is beyond doubt. However, to completely overcome the disaster, it is not feasible to passively rely on state relief. This year, crops in the vast non-disaster areas are growing very well and are expected to have a good harvest. This is a good condition for overcoming the disaster. However, it should not be assumed that the lives of the disaster victims in several provinces can be borne by the people in non-disaster areas. At the same time, for the long-term and huge interests of the people of the whole country, our country is concentrating its efforts on socialist economic construction, and the state cannot provide unlimited funds for disaster relief. If the cost of disaster relief exceeds a certain limit, it will inevitably disrupt the state's economic construction plans and steps, which is detrimental to the people of the whole country, including the people in the disaster areas.
    It should be believed that actively organizing disaster victims to engage in production for self-rescue is the most important way to overcome natural disasters. In the past, when the individual farmer economy dominated, organizing disaster victims to engage in production for self-rescue has achieved great victories many times. Now, with the collectively managed agricultural production cooperatives as a reliance, we will surely be able to achieve greater victories on the production and disaster relief front. Fully leveraging the collective strength of the cooperatives, coupled with the rational use of the state's huge assistance, are the two major conditions necessary for overcoming natural disasters, and the former condition is of decisive significance. Farmers in Xijunshibao Village, Handan County, Hebei, which was surrounded by water on three sides, said: "With the Communist Party and the cooperatives, the greatest difficulties can be overcome! Whoever leaves the cooperative is like a tree without roots, and no matter what method you think of, it won't work." The broad masses of farmers have deeply understood this truth.
    The manpower, material resources, financial resources, and all possible manpower, material resources, and financial resources needed by the disaster-stricken areas should be carefully calculated to implement comprehensive planning. A realistic investigation and study should be conducted on the scope and severity of the disaster. How long can the existing material resources in the region (including the income of the masses and the state's disaster relief funds, and the support from various relevant departments) last, how many problems can be solved, how will the future days be spent, what is still lacking, what practical and reliable production paths can be found, and what measures can be taken to ensure that disaster victims obtain a steady stream of income – all of this requires careful calculation.
    In comprehensive planning, production for disaster relief should be the focus. Those who are not paying enough attention to production should immediately tighten their grip. The first thing to do is to make appropriate overall arrangements for the strength of various agricultural cooperatives and handicraft cooperatives in the region. On the one hand, the enthusiasm of each cooperative and each member to open up production avenues from all aspects should not be restricted; on the other hand, unified leadership should not be abandoned to avoid the occurrence of cooperatives and members blindly going out to find work, competing for raw materials, reducing quality, decoupling production and sales, only caring about agriculture and not paying attention to sideline occupations, or only caring about sideline occupations and neglecting agriculture, so that limited manpower, material resources, and financial resources can be fully utilized.
    Of course, different work priorities should be determined in different regions in the overall plan, neither neglecting the difficult cooperatives and households in lightly affected areas and non-disaster areas, nor neglecting the full use of the strength of non-disaster areas or semi-disaster areas to support disaster areas or severely affected areas. Friendly assistance that is mutually beneficial between these regions should be organized as much as possible.
    In production self-rescue activities, sideline production is particularly important. Past experience has proven that actively and flexibly developing diverse sideline production in disaster areas can not only support farmers in successfully overcoming disasters but also secure a certain foundation for spring plowing production in the coming year. Of course, developing sideline production in disaster areas requires adapting to the specific conditions of the disaster areas and striving to overcome some special difficulties. For example, in terms of labor allocation, many disaster areas often need to drain water and remove mud, salvage the remaining autumn crops, block breaches and restore embankments, rush to plant wheat, and develop sideline production at the same time, which creates a shortage of labor. In this case, it is particularly necessary to uniformly plan various tasks, rationally arrange labor, correctly stipulate labor remuneration, and fully tap the labor potential of rural areas to ensure that the restoration of water conservancy projects, agricultural production, and sideline production are not neglected.
    Now the organization and awareness of the broad masses of farmers in our country have been unprecedentedly improved, and the country's economic strength has also become stronger. Under such conditions, in the process of fighting against natural disasters, as long as we grasp the central link, strengthen organization and leadership, and rely on the strength of the masses themselves, we will surely be victorious.

    战胜灾荒的最重要办法
    今年从5月底开始，有一些地区先后发生了严重的水灾、风灾和旱灾。从全国范围看来，今年的灾情没有1954年水灾那样严重，估计粮食总产量仍然可以比去年有所增加；但是，河北、河南等省的灾情严重程度超过了1954年，吉林、黑龙江两省的水灾也重于东北解放以来灾情最重的1953年，受灾地区的农作物将有不同程度的减产。
    在灾害发生以后，受灾地区的人民群众和工作人员尽了最大的努力，英勇地紧张地进行了抢救工作，大大地减少了损失。不少地方在胜利完成了突击性的抢救工作以后，又展开了经常性的、有计划的生产自救活动，做出了不少成绩。他们提出“减产不减收”的口号，要把在灾害中遭到的损失“补起来”，要把地里丢掉的从水里、山上“找回来”，充满了战胜灾荒的信心。
    不可否认，在灾区的一部分工作人员和农民群众中间，目前也产生了单纯依靠外援、依赖国家救济的思想。在这种思想支配下，就自然放松了组织和领导灾区人民生产自救的具体工作。
    的确，国家正在尽最大可能支援灾区人民。今年国家用于救灾的物力、财力，比以往任何一年都多。今后，国家一定还会继续对灾区给予支援，这是没有问题的。但是，要彻底战胜灾害，消极地依赖国家救济是 不行的。今年广大非灾区农作物大都长得很好，可望丰收。这是战胜灾害的好条件。然而，决不能设想，几个省的灾民的生活，都可以让非灾区人民负担起来。同时，为了全国人民长远的巨大的利益，我们的国家正在集中力量进行社会主义经济建设，国家在救灾方面也不可能无限制地拨款救济。救灾的费用超过了一定限度，势必打乱国家经济建设的计划和步骤，而这对于全国人民，包括灾区人民在内，都是不利的。
    应当相信，积极组织灾民生产自救，是战胜灾荒的最重要办法。过去在个体农民经济占优势的时候，组织灾民生产自救曾经多次取得了巨大的胜利；现在有了集体经营的农业生产合作社作为依靠，我们在生产救灾战线上就一定能够取得更大的胜利。充分发挥合作社的集体的力量，再加上合理地运用国家的巨大援助，这是战胜灾荒所必需的两大条件，而前一个条件是有决定意义的。河北邯郸县三面被水困住的西军师堡的农民说：“有共产党，有合作社，天大的困难也能战胜！谁离开社，谁就像树离开了根，想什么法子也不行。”农民群众已经深刻地懂得了这个道理。
    受灾的地区所需要的人力、物力、财力和一切可能调动的人力、物力、财力应该有一番精密的计算，从而实行全面的规划。对于受灾的范围和轻重程度要实事求是地调查研究。本地区现有的物资力量（包括群众的收入和国家的救灾款、各有关部门的支援）能够维持多久，能够解决多少问题，以后的日子怎么过，还缺少些什么，可以找到哪些切实可靠的生产门路，可能采取哪些措施保证灾民源源取得收入，这一切，都需要精打细算。
    在全面规划中，要以生产救灾为中心。目前有的对生产抓得还不够紧的，应该马上抓紧。首先是要对于本地区各个农业合作社、手工业合作社的力量，加以适当的统筹安排。一方面不可限制各个社和每个社员从各方面开辟生产门路的积极性；一方面也不可放弃统一的领导，以免发生各社和社员盲目外出找工作、争夺原料、降低质量、产销脱节、只顾农业不顾副业或只顾副业放松农业等等现象，以使有限的人力、物力、财力充分地发挥作用。
    当然，在全面规划中应当确定不同地区不同的工作重点，既不要忽视轻灾区和非灾区的困难社和困难户；也不要忽视充分运用非灾区或半灾区的力量支持灾区或重灾区。要尽可能组织这些地区之间互利的友谊的支援。
    在生产自救活动中，特别重要的是副业生产。过去的经验证明：在灾区积极地、灵活地开展多种多样的副业生产，不但能支持农民胜利渡过灾荒，而且可以给来年的春耕生产争取到一定的底垫。当然，在灾区开展副业生产，需要适应灾区的具体情况，努力克服一些特殊的困难。比如在劳动力支配方面，许多灾区往往既要排水脱地，打捞残秋，堵口复堤，抢种小麦，又要开展副业生产，这就发生了劳动力不足的困难。在这种情况下，特别需要统一筹划各项工作，合理安排劳动力，正确规定劳动报酬，充分发掘农村的劳动潜力，作到修复水利工程、农业生产、副业生产三不误。
    现在我国广大农民的组织程度和觉悟程度空前提高了，国家的经济力量也更加强大了。在这样的条件下，我们在同自然灾害进行斗争的过程中，只要抓紧中心环节，加强组织领导，依靠群众自己的力量，就一定会胜利。
