Moscow, September 2nd (By our correspondent) – The great harvest in the Soviet Union has now entered a tense final stage. State farms and collective farms across the country have successively fulfilled state procurement plans ahead of schedule. In the Kazakh Republic, the harvested area has reached three-quarters of the total sown area.

	In the six days from August 25th to September 1st, the Kazakh Republic delivered 176 million poods of grain to the state. Adding to the grain previously delivered, the total is 467.4 million poods; this amount will reach one-half of the total grain plan that the republic should deliver. The largest grain-producing region in northern Kazakhstan, Kustanai Oblast, has delivered 118.5 million poods to the state, and Akmolinsk Oblast has delivered 85.7 million poods. South Kazakhstan Oblast was the first to complete the state grain procurement plan ahead of schedule.

	As of September 1st, the Russian Federal Republic had delivered 1 billion poods of grain to the state, reaching half of the original planned delivery. In the Stavropol Territory, Rostov Oblast, and the Chuvash Autonomous Republic in southern Soviet Union, etc., the state grain procurement plans have been overfulfilled ahead of schedule.

    许多国营农场和农庄提前完成国家采购计划
    本报莫斯科2日电　苏联的大丰收目前已进入紧张的结束阶段。全国各地国营农场和集体农庄已纷纷提前完成国家采购计划。哈萨克共和国完成的收割面积已达全部播种面积的四分之三。
    在8月25日到9月1日的六天内，哈萨克共和国上交给国家的粮食就达一亿七千六百万普特。加上以前所交的粮食一共是四亿六千七百四十万普特；这个数目将达全共和国应该上交的粮食计划二分之一。哈萨克北部最大产粮区库斯坦奈州已交给国家一亿一千八百五十万普特，阿克木林州达八千五百七十万普特。南哈萨克州第一个领先完成了国家粮食采购计划。
    俄罗斯联邦共和国于9月1日已上交给国家十亿普特粮食，将达原定上交计划的一半。苏联南部的斯达维罗保边疆、罗斯托夫州、楚瓦什共和国的楚瓦什州等地已超额提前完成了国家粮食采购计划。
