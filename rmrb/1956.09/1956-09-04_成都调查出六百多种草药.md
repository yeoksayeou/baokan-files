Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 1st. The Chengdu Municipal Health Bureau, through the efforts of herbal medicine practitioners throughout the city, has recently compiled and surveyed over six hundred types of herbal medicine. The survey's main content includes the names, alternative names, harvesting seasons, growth locations, main therapeutic effects, usage and dosage, contraindications, and medicinal parts of the plants.

The survey discovered many herbal medicines with relatively good therapeutic effects. For example, the surveyed "Three Needle" and "Water Coptis" have effects in many aspects equivalent to Coptis chinensis. The "Six Ear Lung-Clearing Decoction," made from five herbal medicines – Five-bark Herb, Frog Herb, Lung Meridian Herb, Rabbit-ear Wind, and June Cold – has considerable therapeutic effect in treating whooping cough. The Sichuan Medical College is conducting further clinical research on these herbal medicines.

Many of the ninety-one herbal medicine practitioners in Chengdu have been in the business for many years, and some are experienced herbal medicine doctors. However, they rarely contact the health departments, and some herbal medicines have six or seven names, while the therapeutic effects of some herbal medicines are only known to a few elderly doctors. Since June, the Municipal Health Bureau, the Health Workers Association, and elderly gentlemen within the Provincial Museum of Culture and History who understand traditional Chinese medicine have jointly formed a survey team and started this survey work.

    成都调查出六百多种草药
    新华社成都1日电　成都市卫生局最近通过全市草药业的从业人员，整理调查了六百多种草药。调查的主要内容包括名称、别名、采撷季节、生长地点、主要疗效、用法用量、禁忌、药用部分等。
    调查中发现了许多有比较好的疗效的草药。例如调查出的三颗针、水黄连，它们的功效在许多方面相当于黄连。五皮草、青蛙草、肺经草、兔耳风、六月寒等五味草药制成的六耳清肺汤，治疗百日咳有相当好的疗效。四川医学院对这些草药正在作进一步的临床研究。
    成都市九十一户草药业的从业人员，有许多已经营多年，有的还是有经验的草药医生。但是他们很少和卫生部门联系，有些草药有六、七种名称，有些草药的疗效只有个别老医生知道。从6月份起，市卫生局、卫生工作者协会和省文史馆内懂得中医、中药的老先生共同组成调查组，开始了这一调查工作。
