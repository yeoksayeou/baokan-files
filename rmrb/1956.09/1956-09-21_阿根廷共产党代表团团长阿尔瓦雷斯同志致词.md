At this historically significant congress, on behalf of the Central Committee of our Party and the Argentine communists, we extend our warmest and heartfelt respect to the great Chinese Communist Party, its beloved leaders, the friends attending the congress, and the representatives of all fraternal parties.

As the National Day of the People's Republic of China approaches, we pay tribute to it and its heroic and friendly people. Under the guidance and leadership of the glorious Communist Party, the Chinese people have found a path of united front that can unite all patriotic forces. In the period of historically significant revolutionary struggle, they have thoroughly destroyed the dark rule of imperialism and feudalism, won liberation, and established a new system of people's democracy that is constantly progressing. Today, the Chinese people are advancing victoriously along the road of socialist transformation.

The victorious road taken by the People's Republic of China is undoubtedly the victory and result of the correct application of the glorious Marxist-Leninist line in the specific conditions of China. For us Argentine communists, it is a valuable example, that is, your party has the leadership of the collective wisdom of the Central Committee, and at the same time is good at absorbing the rich experience of the great socialist revolution of the glorious Soviet Union. All this has opened up new avenues for national progress and the happiness of the people.

We dare to say that this congress will mark an important period in the life of your republic. The congress's valuable resolutions will not only help consolidate the socialist camp, but will also greatly promote the greatest and broadest friendship among the people of all countries. All this will be a huge support for the peace movement, for the movement of men and women all over the world who are struggling to avoid the horrors of war and to strive for disarmament and peaceful understanding among the peoples of all countries.

We, the comrades of the Argentine fraternal delegation, are deeply pleased to be able to participate in your meeting, and we express our gratitude. We will strive to understand and absorb the important experience of the meeting.

The experience you have gained in your epoch-making victorious struggle against imperialism and feudalism and for national independence and liberation has inspired and strengthened the confidence of the people of colonial, semi-colonial, and dependent countries, like our people, who are struggling for national and social liberation.

In the current domestic political situation, our party faces a great patriotic task: to unite all progressive forces within a broad national democratic united front in order to defeat imperialism, reactionary big capital, and the landlord oligarchic government—they maintain our country's backwardness, deprive us of democratic rights, and impoverish the lives of the working masses. But we can say with certainty that the sentiment of resisting this anti-national policy is growing among the masses of the people. Our working class and people want to live a life of freedom, independence, progress, and peace, and are fighting for it.

As the standard-bearer of these aspirations, our party, under the guidance of Marxist-Leninist science and inheriting the fine legacy of our national heroes, is advancing and organizing this liberation struggle, and is striving to find ways to promote mutual understanding among various political and social forces, in order to establish a democratic coalition government with progressive social content. Our current urgent task is to resolutely stop the constant coups and counter-coups currently instigated by the reactionary oligarchic government and imperialist groups, because they attempt to establish puppet surrender governments, while hoping to block the democratic and popular path sought by the working masses.

However, the development of the current international situation and the actual situation in our country prove that the analysis of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is correct: the colonial system is collapsing and the people's struggle against the oppression of imperialism and oligarchic regimes is unfolding all over the world—including Latin America.

We Argentine communists adhere to these struggles and believe that as long as we learn from the important and rich experience of fraternal parties in various countries, rely on the working class, develop the worker-peasant alliance, organize the people's struggle for rights, and strengthen our party building work among the broad masses, we will surely achieve great success in our work.

In this sense, dear comrades of the Chinese Communist Party, we believe that your congress will be a huge and invaluable help to our party and the Argentine working class.

We also believe that when we wish your meeting and your work plan complete success in the name of our country's working class, peasants, and progressive masses, we are expressing their thoughts, because your meeting and work plan are the foundation of the country's strength and the happiness of the heroic Chinese people.

Long live the great fraternal Chinese Communist Party and its Central Committee!
Long live the People's Republic of China!
Long live the leader of progressive mankind, the glorious Soviet Union!
Long live the friendship of the peoples of all countries! Long live peace!
Long live the fraternal friendship of the communist parties of all countries!
Long live the scientific theory of Marxism-Leninism!
Long live the friendship between the Chinese and Argentine people! (Attached picture)

    阿根廷共产党代表团团长阿尔瓦雷斯同志致词
    在这次具有历史意义的代表大会上，我们谨代表我们的党中央委员会和阿根廷的共产党人，向伟大的中国共产党、向它的亲爱的领袖们、向出席大会的朋友们及各兄弟党的代表同志们，表示我们最热忱的衷心的敬意。
    在中华人民共和国国庆日即将到来的时候，我们谨向它和它英勇友好的人民致敬。中国人民在光荣的共产党的指引和领导下，找到了一条能团结一切爱国力量的统一战线的道路，在具有历史意义的革命斗争的时期里，彻底地摧毁了帝国主义和封建的黑暗统治，获得了解放，并且建立了一个不断进步的人民民主的新制度。今天，中国人民正在沿着社会主义改造道路胜利地前进。
    中华人民共和国所走的胜利的道路，无疑就是光辉的马克思列宁主义路线在中国具体情况下正确运用的胜利和结果，它对我们阿根廷的共产党人来说，是一个宝贵的榜样，这就是，你们的党有着中央委员会集体智慧的领导，同时又善于吸取了光荣苏联的伟大社会主义革命的丰富经验。所有这一切都为国家的进步和人民的幸福开辟了新的道路。
    我们敢说，这次代表大会将在你们共和国的生活中，标志一个重要的时期，大会宝贵的决议不仅将有助于社会主义阵营的巩固，也将又一次大大地推进各国人民间最大最广泛的友谊。这一切对于和平运动，对于全世界男男女女为避免战争的恐怖并争取裁减军备和各国人民间的和平谅解而斗争的运动将是一个巨大的支援。
    我们阿根廷兄弟代表团的同志们能够参加你们的会议，深深地感到欣幸，我们表示感谢。我们将努力体会和吸取会议的重大经验。
    在你们反对帝国主义和封建主义，并争取民族独立和解放的划时代的胜利斗争中所取得的经验，鼓舞并加强了像我国人民一样的那些在为民族和社会解放而斗争着的殖民地、半殖民地及附属国人民的信心。
    在目前国内的政治情况下，我们的党面临着一个伟大的爱国任务：把一切进步力量团结在一个广泛的全国民主统一战线内，以便战胜帝国主义、反动大资本和地主寡头政府——他们保持着我国的落后状态，剥夺了民主权利，使劳动群众生活贫困。但是我们可以肯定地说，抵抗这种反民族的政策的情绪正在人民群众中增长着，我国的工人阶级和人民要过自由、独立、进步与和平的生活，并且正在为它而斗争着。
    作为这些抱负的旗手的我们的党，在马克思列宁主义科学的指导下，并继承了我们民族英雄们的优良遗产，正推进和组织这一解放斗争，并且正为觅致能促进各种不同的政治和社会力量间相互了解的道路而努力，以便建立一个具有进步的社会内容的民主联合政府。我们目前提出的迫切任务就是：要坚决制止目前由反动寡头政府和帝国主义集团唆使的不断的政变和反政变，因为它们企图建立傀儡投降政府，同时希望堵塞劳动群众争取的民主和人民的出路。
    但是，当前国际形势的发展和我们本国的实际情况，证明了苏联共产党第二十次代表大会分析是正确的：殖民体系正在崩溃而人民反对帝国主义和寡头政权压迫的斗争在全世界各地——包括拉丁美洲在内——展开着。
    我们阿根廷的共产党人坚持着这些斗争，并且相信，只要我们吸取各国兄弟党重大丰富的经验，依靠工人阶级，发展工农联盟和组织人民争取权利的斗争，加强我们在广大群众中的建党工作，我们一定也能在工作中取得巨大的成就。
    在这意义上，亲爱的中国共产党的同志们，我们相信，你们的代表大会对我们的党和阿根廷的工人阶级来说，将是个巨大的、无可估计的帮助。
    我们也相信，当我们以我国工人阶级、农人和进步群众的名义预祝你们的会议和你们的工作计划圆满成功的时候，我们是表达了他们的思想的，因为你们的会议和工作计划是国家的强大和英勇的中国人民的幸福的基础。
    伟大的兄弟党中国共产党和它的中央委员会万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    进步人类的领袖、光荣的苏联万岁！
    各国人民的友谊万岁！和平万岁！
    各国共产党兄弟般的友谊万岁！
    马克思列宁主义的科学理论万岁！
    中国—阿根廷人民的友谊万岁！（附图片）
