	“Taking Advantage” of an Inspection Flight
	In late July, the Shandong Provincial Department of Agriculture, in order to help Xiajin County, a key cotton-producing area of the province, control late-stage cotton pests, specifically rented an aircraft from the Civil Aviation Administration of China to spray insecticide over the cotton fields of Xiajin County. Secretary Chen of the County Party Committee (who was also the director of the county's pest control headquarters) happened to be returning from a provincial Party Congress in Qingdao. Having been away from the county for a long time, and thus not understanding the cotton growth and pest situation, he drew up a route and boarded the plane alone for an aerial "inspection." After Secretary Chen got off the plane, Deputy Secretary Li also went up for an "inspection." In fact, before the two secretaries went up, Section Chief Zhao of the County People's Committee had already "inspected" twice on the plane.
	This aircraft was meant to spray insecticide, and therefore should not have been used to transport people casually. Obstructing the spraying of insecticide is tantamount to hindering the eradication of pests. The two secretaries and Section Chief Zhao should have understood this principle, but they forgot to use this principle to restrain themselves. Were they really inspecting the pest situation? This is also worth questioning, because even a "cursory glance" is insufficient for detailed "flower viewing," and with the plane flying so high and so fast, how could they "inspect" pests from above! People who use work as an excuse to satisfy their own desires are not limited to these three people, nor to this one incident. Everyone should learn a lesson from this.

    “乘机”视察
    7月下旬，山东省农业厅为了帮助省的重点产棉区夏津县防治棉花后期害虫，特地租用了中国民用航空公司的一架飞机，到夏津县的棉田上空喷撒药剂。县委陈书记（也是县的治虫指挥部主任）恰巧由青岛开完省的党代表大会回来，因为离县日子长了，不了解棉花生长情况和虫害情况，就画上路线坐上飞机独自一人在空中“视察”了一番。陈书记下机以后，李副书记也上去“视察”了一遍。其实，在他们两人上去以前，县人民委员会的赵科长就已随机“视察”过二遍。
    这架飞机既是用来喷撒药剂，那么就不应随便坐人。因为妨碍了喷撒药剂，也就是妨碍了根治害虫。两位书记和赵科长都应当明白这个道理，可是他们忘了用这个道理约束自己。他们是不是真的为了“视察”虫害情况呢？这也值得怀疑，因为“走马”尚且不能仔细“观花”，飞机飞得那么高，那么快，又怎样能够在上面“视察”虫害！像这样用工作作借口来满足自己欲望的人，不只是这样三个人，也不只是这样一件事，大家都应该从这里得到教训。
