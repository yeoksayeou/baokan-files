    Rapidly Determine the Expansion Plan for the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant
    Comrade Zhou Guanwu's Speech
    Expanding the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant into an iron and steel complex with an annual output of one million tons can shorten the time by half and save 30% of the investment compared to building a new one of the same scale, and all investment can be recovered in four years.
    I fully agree with the three reports of the Central Committee. I fully agree with the draft Party Constitution and the proposals for the Second Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy. I would now like to express some opinions on the development of the iron and steel industry. I believe that in the Second Five-Year Plan, in addition to accelerating the construction of the three major iron and steel bases in Anshan, Baotou, and Wuhan, as well as other new bases, we should also carefully summarize the experience of the First Five-Year Plan and pay full attention to utilizing the existing iron and steel industrial base, so that the output of steel can be rapidly increased to meet the country's growing urgent need for steel, and effectively support the construction of new industrial bases in the interior.
    The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant has many favorable conditions and is one of the iron and steel industrial bases that should be fully utilized. It already has a considerable scale. Its site conditions are very good, the industrial water supply has been resolved, and it is not far from the coking coal production areas of North China and the Longyan Iron Mine. Moreover, the Longyan Iron Mine has abundant reserves, enough to supply the needs of a large iron and steel enterprise. Shijingshan and Longyan are already a good foundation for an iron and steel complex. Expanding on this basis can achieve greater results with less investment and in a shorter period of time.
    According to our preliminary research, building a new iron and steel base with an annual output of one million tons requires a large amount of investment and eight or nine years. That is to say, from the start of construction in 1957 to around 1964 or 1965, it can be fully put into production. Utilizing the existing foundation of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant and the Longyan Iron Mine, expanding it into a modern iron and steel complex of the same scale, the time can be shortened by half, and the investment can be saved by about 30%. The investment saved can be used to build several cotton textile mills with 100,000 spindles. In particular, during the expansion process, the output of steel can be continuously increased every year, which can rapidly and without missing the opportunity strengthen our country's economic power.
    After the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant is completed and put into production, the total sum of profits, taxes, and basic depreciation turned over to the state each year, according to preliminary estimates, is equivalent to about one-fourth of the total fixed assets after expansion. The state can recover the entire investment in about four years. Compared with building a new iron and steel plant of the same scale at the same time, when the new plant is completed, the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant will have already recovered its entire investment and produced a large amount of steel, and will have cultivated a complete set of technical forces and management cadres. In addition, after the expansion of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, the coke oven gas can also meet the needs of scientific research institutions, universities, and hundreds of thousands of residents in the capital.
    Therefore, I suggest that the Central Committee quickly determine the expansion plan for the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, so that it can be carried out rapidly during the Second Five-Year Plan period. We guarantee that under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and the central competent departments, and with the full support of the people of the capital, we will complete the glorious task of expanding the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant in a good, fast, and economical manner.

    迅速确定石景山钢铁厂的扩建计划
    周冠五同志的发言
    把石景山钢铁厂扩建成年产一百万吨的钢铁联合企业，比新建一个同样规模的，时间可缩短一半，投资可节约百分之三十，而且四年可收回全部投资。
    我完全同意中央委员会的三个报告。完全同意党的章程草案和关于发展国民经济的第二个五年计划的建议。我现在只就钢铁工业的发展问题，发表一些意见。我认为，在第二个五年计划中，除了必须加紧鞍山、包头、武汉三大钢铁基地以及其他新基地的建设以外，同时还应该很好地总结第一个五年计划的经验，充分注意利用原有的钢铁工业基础，使钢铁的产量迅速增长，以适应国家对钢铁日益增长的迫切需要，并有效地支援内地的新的工业基地的建设。
    石景山钢铁厂具有许多有利的条件，是应该加以充分利用的钢铁工业基础之一。已具备相当的规模。它的厂址条件很好，工业用水已经解决，它和华北炼焦煤的产地和龙烟铁矿都相距不远，而且龙烟铁矿蕴藏量丰富，足以供应一个大的钢铁企业的需要。石景山和龙烟已经是一个钢铁联合企业的良好的基础，在这个基础上进行扩建，就能够用较少的资金、较短的时间，取得较大的效果。
    据我们初步研究，新建一个年产一百万吨的钢铁基地，需要大量的投资和八、九年的时间。这就是说，从一九五七年开始建设到一九六四年或一九六五年左右才能全部投入生产。而利用石景山钢铁厂和龙烟铁矿现有的基础，把它扩建成为同样规模的现代化的钢铁联合企业，时间可以缩短一半，投资可以节省百分之三十左右，这部分节省下来的投资，就可以新建几个十万锭的棉纺织厂。特别是它在扩建的过程中，每年都可以不断地增加钢铁的产量，可以迅速地、不丧失时机地增强我国的经济力量。
    石景山钢铁厂建成投入生产以后，每年向国家上缴的利润、税金和基本折旧的总和，据初步估算，就相当于扩建后全部固定资产的四分之一左右。大约四年时间，国家就可以收回全部投资。如果和同时新建一个同样规模的钢铁厂比较起来，则新厂建成时，石景山钢铁厂已经收回了它的全部投资，并且早已生产出大量的钢铁，又能培养出成套的技术力量和管理干部。另外，石景山钢铁厂扩建后，焦炉煤气还可解决首都科学研究机关、高等学校和数十万居民的需要。
    因此，我建议中央迅速确定石景山钢铁厂的扩建计划，以便在第二个五年计划期间迅速进行。我们保证，在党中央和中央主管部门的正确领导下，在首都人民的全力支持下，一定会又好、又快、又省地完成扩建石景山钢铁厂的光荣任务。
