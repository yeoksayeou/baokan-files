Underwater Torchlight
By our reporter Cao Baoming

When one mentions divers, images of them wearing copper helmets and rubber suits, diving into the deep blue to explore or salvage sunken ships – scenes from movies – naturally come to mind. But the work of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge divers is much more complex than that. They not only unscrewed bolts, sawed steel bars, and detonated pile tips underwater, but they also used high-pressure electric arcs to burn and cut thick channel steel and angle iron underwater.

On land, electric welding is a fascinating specialized technique, but what about underwater cutting? I interviewed three divers at the foot of Yellow Crane Tower, Xu Xianye, Tan Yunbiao, and Hu Hailin. Xu Xianye was a burly man with bulging chest and arm muscles, a weightlifting athlete; Tan Yunbiao was a short man but very sturdy; Hu Hailin, of medium build, was thin but of iron constitution. All three of them switched careers to learn diving after 1952. At the beginning of last year, upon hearing that the bridge required underwater cutting, they all took the time to learn electric welding on land in advance, eager to master this special technique of underwater cutting.

However, things didn't go smoothly. When they gathered at the foot of Yellow Crane Tower in early June last year to learn this special skill, the leadership consistently didn't provide them with welding machines for practice. It wasn't until September, when the No. 8 pier's second caisson sinking required "underwater cutting," that the leaders of the Second Bridge Team transferred a welding machine, requiring them to learn this technique and participate in the work within three or four days. Despite this unreasonable requirement and the tight schedule, everyone was still excited to take turns diving into the water to practice.

Tan Yunbiao, who transferred from being a fitter, had truly nimble hands. He struck the arc on his first dive. A red light immediately pierced the underwater darkness, and many blue bubbles floated to the surface. At this time, looking out from the copper helmet's faceplate, the white arc light that stung the eyes on land was just a dim red glow in the water. His hands were numb and painful as if burned, and he smelled a coppery odor, which was very uncomfortable. But it was so difficult to get this opportunity to practice! He still insisted on burning several welding rods underwater, estimating that the iron plate had been burned through, before floating to the surface. Upon coming up, his hands were fine, without any damage; but the iron plate, less than seven millimeters thick, only had a two-cun-long groove with some small pinhole-like openings, not completely burned through.

While everyone was pondering why they couldn't burn through the iron plate, the resourceful Hu Hailin was the first to find the reason and the solution. It turned out that the flowing water made it difficult to hold the hand steady in one place, and everyone was not proficient in electric welding, so it was naturally difficult to burn through the iron plate. He devised a wooden frame so that the welding rod could be burned along the edge of the wooden frame, concentrating the heat. Xu Xianye and a worker named Chen worked with Hu Hailin to create a hollow wooden groove, placing the welding rod in the groove to burn, making it even less likely to shake.

Initially, some people didn't believe this method would work, so Hu Hailin took the wooden groove underwater. At this time, everyone quietly watched the water's surface. After a while, many bubbles rushed out of the water, indicating he had begun cutting. After four or five minutes, everyone couldn't help but surround the telephone operator and shout, "How is it? Ask Lao Hu, how is it?" The telephone operator, afraid of distracting Lao Hu in the water, waved his hands anxiously, telling everyone not to make noise. Just then, the telephone operator suddenly smiled, and everyone asked anxiously, "How is it?" "He said the angle iron is cut." Everyone immediately squeezed to the side of the water ladder, grabbing the angle iron to pass around. One said, "It's really like being cut with a knife, so smooth." Another said, "It's done, there's a way for underwater cutting." Everyone was busy for a while before realizing they hadn't taken off Hu Hailin's copper helmet yet. He stood there blankly, unable to interject, and everyone laughed again. After the copper helmet was removed, Hu Hailin said, "It only took half a welding rod to cut it open."

It only took four or five minutes, and only half a welding rod, to cut a piece of angle iron! In the past, they had sawn steel bars a few millimeters thick on the Jianghan Bridge, breaking countless saw blades and spending countless weeks before finally sawing through one in just over an hour. This was such an exciting thing!

However, after they practiced for two days, just when they were starting to get the hang of it, the No. 8 pier's caisson no longer needed underwater cutting, and the Second Bridge Team took the welding machine away again. At this time, everyone was very angry, urging the team leader Lao Meng to appeal to the captain and the bureau chief, but the leaders still refused to allocate a welding machine to them.

By February of this year, while working, they were still thinking about that fascinating underwater cutting. One day, Hu Hailin, who had temporarily gone out to help the power plant, came back with good news: "The steel sheet piles of No. 2 pier at the foot of Turtle Mountain on the opposite bank cannot be pulled out, and the holes on the steel sheet piles have been damaged. Now they need to re-burn the holes in the water and then pull them out. The Shanghai divers temporarily hired by the power plant have all been invited." Everyone was anxious when they heard this: "Why invite divers from outside and not let us do it?" That night, they decided to send Lao Meng and Tan Yunbiao across the river to investigate.

As soon as the two of them crossed the river, they saw many people standing by the river as they walked to the machinery rental station. Soviet expert Plekhanov was also there watching, and someone was testing underwater cutting in the shallows. They inquired carefully and learned that the No. 2 pier project was very urgent, and since they couldn't find anyone who knew this technique, the leaders decided to let land-based welders learn underwater cutting. Tan Yunbiao didn't think much of it when he heard this: "Even if the welders learn it, they don't know how to dive and can't go into deep water, right?" But he didn't say anything, just stood beside them, watching angrily, seeing some people able to burn a few pinholes, and some unable to burn even pinholes. The expert saw the two of them standing still and asked them to go into the water to try it out.

Tan Yunbiao went into the water, and Lao Meng controlled the machine switch on the boat. At this time, Tan Yunbiao was in the water, recalling the situation of his past practice, while trying to steady his hands and prevent the welding rod from shaking. He burned a crescent-shaped opening on his first try, burning it thoroughly and neatly. Tan Yunbiao was very happy about this. Some people saw that he had succeeded and rushed to try again, but he didn't compete with others, handing over the welding handle. However, the expert disagreed with this and wanted him to burn again. As a result, he continued to burn a semi-circular opening.

At this time, the Soviet expert personally turned off the power and asked them how many people knew this technique. Tan Yunbiao, who was in high spirits, immediately said, "There are many more." The expert wanted them to provide a list so they could start working tomorrow. Lao Meng thought carefully, there were quite a few people who had practiced last time, but not many who were proficient. People like Hu Hailin were temporarily away on business, so he only wrote down the names of himself, Tan Yunbiao, and Xu Xianye.

The next day, the Second Bridge Team emphasized that they were busy and wouldn't let Xu Xianye leave, only allowing Lao Meng and Tan Yunbiao to report for duty. The expert was excited when he saw them: "You're all here? I want to shake hands with each of you and wish you success in your work." After shaking hands, he realized that one person was missing, and Lao Meng had to tell the truth. After the expert made a suggestion, a special boat was immediately sent with the order of the Engineering Bureau to bring Xu Xianye over. The three of them and the Shanghai workers who were temporarily hired were divided into two shifts to work.

Tan Yunbiao was the first to sink into the water two meters to the place where the holes needed to be burned. His head and feet were all in the water, and the steel sheet piles were straight, with no place to stand, making it impossible to exert force. He came up and requested scaffolding. The Soviet expert immediately drew a diagram himself. The political commissar of the bridge team also instructed the canteen to provide them with good food and meals to ensure they had enough nutrition. Seeing that the experts and leaders were so supportive, they were both happy and nervous, afraid that they would not be able to complete the task and delay the construction period.

Indeed, the time spent underwater in past experiments was very short, but now in formal work, they had to work continuously in the water for three or four hours at a time. Their hands were numb as if they had been burned off, and the coppery smell was very irritating. Lao Meng, who was in poor physical condition, couldn't hold on for long after going underwater. In his panic, he didn't notice that the oxygen was used up, and the white-hot welding rod molten liquid wasn't blown away, flowing down and burning his hand. Tan Yunbiao and Xu Xianye took turns diving more times to catch up with Lao Meng's lagging work.

The two of them were determined to get the steel sheet piles of No. 2 pier pulled out quickly, enduring the physical pain, and finally found a way to improve efficiency. Initially, they burned the welding rod east and west in the circle, which was time-consuming and used a lot of welding rods. Later, they moved the welding rod little by little along the circle. The first welding rod burned around the perimeter, and the second welding rod rechecked the unburned areas, and a hole was quickly burned. Once the work had a knack, the physical pain disappeared, and they were completely immersed in the joy of working. In this way, the first shift burned eight holes, and then gradually increased, reaching a maximum of a dozen holes. Later, the Shanghai workers also caught up. The underwater cutting task of the No. 2 pier's steel sheet piles was completed within a few days.

Then, the flood came. The No. 7 pier in the mainstream of the Yangtze River was being heavily impacted by the flood and needed to quickly burn and cut off the damaged "outer guide ring" and the submerged "berthing bracket" (a steel frame for berthing ships) in order to speed up construction. Cutting in the rapids made people sweat, and the steel ring had a spring force when it was cut off. If you weren't careful, you could be bounced into the mainstream and washed away, which was very dangerous. Xu Xianye, who was temporarily acting as team leader, discussed with Hu Hailin and Tan Yunbiao and changed the original plan of cutting each ring into two sections to three sections to reduce the spring force of the steel ring. At the same time, he asked everyone to observe the water's force before diving, standing in places where the flow was not rapid to prevent being washed away. As a result, the three of them took turns diving and quickly completed the task of burning and cutting the "outer guide ring." During the second burning and cutting of the "berthing bracket," the water rose very quickly. Every minute and every second was precious to the No. 7 pier. Who knew that after everyone cut the angle iron of the "berthing bracket" and went ashore to eat, the "berthing bracket" still couldn't be lifted. At this time, Xu Xianye was so anxious that he didn't even bother to eat, and immediately sank into the river to investigate. After he found out that there were still two pieces of angle iron that hadn't been cut, he took the welding handle and welding rod underwater to cut them, and the "berthing bracket" was immediately lifted. Underwater cutting saved time for the repair of No. 7 pier.

When I interviewed them, all three of them had been rated as advanced producers. The fascinating work of underwater cutting still attracted them, and they said happily, "After the bridge piers are completed, there are still many angle iron and channel steel that need to be removed underwater. Underwater cutting is very useful. Now, wherever there are obstacles, we go to burn and cut, which is fast and good!"

The underwater torchlight cleared various obstacles in the water; and the torchlight in their hearts burned away the bureaucracy in their work, helping them quickly learn this technique, so that the underwater torchlight could exert its power!

    水底的火光
    本报记者　曹葆铭
    一提起潜水工，他们头戴铜盔，身穿橡皮衣潜入蓝色的深水探消息或捞沉船的景象——那在电影里见过的景象，便很自然地出现在我们眼前。武汉长江大桥潜水工的工作却比这还复杂得多。他们不仅在水底卸过螺丝，锯过钢条，炸过桩尖，他们还在水底用高压的电弧去烧割过粗大的槽钢、角铁。
    陆上的电焊是桩引人入迷的专门技术，那么水下切割又是怎么回事呢？我在黄鹤楼下访问了三个潜水工，他们叫徐贤业、谈云彪、胡海林。徐贤业身材魁伟，胸脯和胳臂的肌肉都鼓的很高，是个举重健将；谈云彪是个矮个子，但也很坚实；中等身材的胡海林却很瘦，是个铁骨人。他们三个都是1952年后才转业学潜水的，去年年初听说大桥需要进行水下切割，都事先抽空在陆上学习电焊，一心想学会水下切割这项特别的技术。
    但是，事情并不顺利。去年6月初，他们集中到黄鹤楼下来学这门特别的技术的时候，领导上始终不给电焊机让他们实习。拖到9月里，八号墩第二次下沉围囹需要“水下切割”，第二桥梁队领导上才调来一部电焊机，要他们在三、四天内学会这门技术参加工作。尽管这个规定并不合理，时间也很紧迫，大家仍然兴冲冲地轮流下水去实习。
    由钳工转业的谈云彪，一双手真是灵巧，他头次下水就搭上了火。一股红光立即划破了水下的黑暗，水面上也浮起许多蓝色的气泡。这时，他从铜盔的镜面望出去，那在陆上刺得人眼睛疼痛的白色电弧光，在水里只是团暗淡的红光，他的两手被电麻得像烫伤了似的疼痛，并且闻到一股铜锈味儿，很难受。但是好容易才盼到这个实习的机会啊！他仍然坚持着在水下烧了几根焊条，估计铁板已经烧穿了，才浮出水面来。上来一看，两手好端端的，没有丝毫损伤；那不到七公厘厚的铁板上却只烧了一道两公寸长的槽子，槽子里有些麻点似的小洞，并没有完全烧穿。
    大家正在琢磨为什么不能把铁板烧穿，机智的胡海林首先找出了原因，找出了办法。原来是流水将手冲动得不能固定地在一个地方烧，大家对电焊又不熟练，自然很难将铁板烧穿。他想法作了个木框子，让焊条沿着木框边缘烧，火力就集中了。徐贤业和一个姓陈的工人又同胡海林一起研究，索性作了个木头的空心槽子，将焊条搁在槽子里烧，就更不容易晃动了。
    最初，有人还不相信这办法能行，胡海林便带着木头槽子下水去了。这时，大家都静静地望着水面。一会儿水里冲出许多气泡，他开始烧割了。过了四、五分钟，大家又忍不住，都围着电话员喊叫：“怎么样了？你问问老胡，怎么样了？”电话员怕分散水里老胡的注意力，急的直摇手，要大家莫吵。正在这时，电话员忽然笑了，大家急问道：“怎么样了？”“他说角铁割开了。”大家马上又挤到水梯旁边去，等胡海林一上来，就抢过角铁去传看。这个说：“真是跟刀切的一样，这么平整。”那个说：“行了，水下切割有办法了。”大家忙乱了一阵子，才发现还没有替胡海林卸开头上的铜盔，他呆呆地站在一旁没法插嘴，大家又乐起来了。等卸下铜盔以后，胡海林才说：“只烧了半根焊条就割开了。”
    只用四、五分钟，只用半根焊条，就割断了一根角铁！他们过去在江汉桥锯几公厘粗的钢筋，不知弄断了多少锯条，费了多少周析，最后才做到一点多钟锯断一根。这是多么令人兴奋的事啊！
    但是，当他们实习了两天，刚学的有点头绪的时候，八号墩围囹不需要水下切割了，第二桥梁队又将电焊机调走了。这时，大家很恼火，要领队的老孟去找队长申诉，找局长申诉，但领导上还是不肯抽一部电焊机给他们。
    到了今年2月，他们一边工作，一边还在思念那迷人的水下切割。一天，临时出外帮助电厂工作的胡海林回来报告了个好消息：“对岸龟山脚下的二号墩钢板桩拔不动，把钢板桩上的眼子都拔坏了，现在要在水中重烧眼子再拔，把电厂临时雇的上海潜水工都请去了。”大家一听，就急了：“为什么去请外边的潜水工，也不让我们作呢？”当天夜里，他们就决定让老孟和谈云彪过江去探听消息。
    他两人一过江去，刚走到机械经租站，就看见江边站着许多人，苏联专家普列赫罗夫也在那里观看，有人在浅水处试验水下切割呢。他们仔细打听，才知道二号墩工程很紧急，一下子又找不到会这门技术的人，领导上便决定让陆上的电焊工来学水下切割。谈云彪一听就不以为然：“电焊工学会了，又不会潜水，也下不了深水啊？”但是他没说话，只气鼓鼓地站在旁边观看，看见有的能烧出几个麻点来，有的连麻点也烧不出。专家见他两人站着没动，叫他们也下水去试验试验。
    谈云彪下水去了，老孟在船上掌握机器开关。谈云彪这时在水中一边回忆过去实习的情形，一边省着力将手掌稳，不让焊条晃动。他第一次就烧出了个月牙形的口子来，烧的满透满整齐。谈云彪这下可高兴了。有的人见他成功了，也抢着要去再试，他也不同别人争，把电焊刀把交出去了，但是专家不同意这样作，要他再烧。结果，他又继续烧成了一个半圆形的口子。
    这时，苏联专家亲自去关了电门，问他们还有多少人会这项技术，正在兴头上的谈云彪马上就说：“还有很多。”专家又要他们开出名单来，明天就来参加工作。老孟仔细一想，上次实习的人倒不少，但会的人并不多，像胡海林这样的人，又临时出差了，便只写下他二人和徐贤业的名字。
    第二天，第二桥梁队强调工作忙不放徐贤业走，只让老孟和谈云彪去报到。专家一见他们就兴冲冲地讲：“都来了？我要同你们每个人握握手，预祝你们工作成功。”一握手就发现短了一个人，老孟只好实说。经专家提出意见，马上派了个专轮带着工程局的命令去将徐贤业接过江来了。由他们三人同临时聘请的上海工人分成两班工作。
    谈云彪首先沉到水里两公尺需要烧眼子的地方去试了试，头上脚下都是水，钢板桩也是笔直的，没个落脚处，使不上劲，便上来要求作个脚手架。苏联专家马上亲自绘了图。桥队的政治委员也指示食堂供应他们好菜好饭，保证他们有足够的营养。一见专家和领导上都这样支持，他们又高兴，又紧张，害怕自己完不成任务，延误工期。
    果然，过去试验每次下水的时间都很短，而现在正式工作一次得连续在水里工作三、四个小时，双手都麻的就像烫掉了似的，铜锈味也刺得人很难受。体质较差的老孟下水不久就顶不住了，慌忙中没有注意氧气烧完了，白热的焊条熔液没有吹散，淌下来烧坏了自己的手。谈云彪和徐贤业便轮流多下几趟水，赶老孟拉下的工作。
    他们两人一心想让二号墩钢板桩赶快拔起来，忍受着身体的痛苦，终于找出了提高效率的办法。最初，他们将焊条在圆圈内东烧一下，西烧一下，费时间，也费焊条。后来他们把焊条沿着圆圈一点一点地移动，头根焊条把周围烧一圈，第二根便复查没烧穿的地方，一个眼子很快便烧成了。工作一有了窍门，身体的痛苦也没有了，他们完全沉浸在工作的欢乐中了。这样一来，头一班便烧成了八个眼子，接着又逐步上升，最高达到十几个眼子。后来，上海来的工人也追上来了。二号墩钢板桩的水下切割任务，几天之内便完成了。
    接着，洪水来了。正当长江主流的七号墩被洪水冲的很厉害，需要赶快将冲坏了的“外导环”和淹没了的“靠把”（靠船用的钢铁架）烧割掉，才好加紧施工。在急水里去烧割，人累的直淌汗，而钢环烧断时还有股弹力，稍不注意，人就会被弹到主流中冲走，非常危险。临时代理领队的徐贤业便找胡海林、谈云彪研究，把原来每道环烧割成两段的计划改为割成三段，减少钢环的弹力，同时要大家在下水之前看清水势，站在流水不急的地方，防止被冲走。结果，他们三人轮流下水去，很快便完成了烧割“外导环”的任务。在第二次烧割“靠把”时，水涨的很急，一分钟、一秒钟的时间，对七号墩都很宝贵。谁知大家切割了“靠把”的角铁上岸吃饭去后，“靠把”还吊不起来。这时，徐贤业急的饭也顾不上吃了，马上沉到江中去摸情况。他弄清还有两根角铁没有割断后，又带着电焊刀把和焊条下水去切割，“靠把”也就马上吊起来了。水下切割为抢修七号墩赢得了时间。
    我去访问他们的时候，他们三人都已被评为先进生产者了。水底切割的迷人的工作，还是吸引着他们，他们兴高彩烈地说：“大桥桥墩修成后，水下还有很多角铁、槽钢需要清除，水下切割的用处可大啦。我们现在是哪里有障碍，便到哪里去烧割，又快，又好！”
    水底的火光扫除了水中的各种障碍；而他们心上的火光烧掉了工作中的官僚主义，帮助他们迅速学会了这项技术，才使水底的火光能施展出威力来！
