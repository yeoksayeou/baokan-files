Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, September 25th: Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Mononutu told reporters today that Indonesian Prime Minister Ali Sastroamidjojo has sent telegrams to the government leaders of the countries that participated in last year's Bandung Conference, expressing the hope that these countries will make joint efforts to strive for a peaceful resolution of the Suez Canal issue.

Sastroamidjojo was the chairman of last year's Asian-African Conference.

Mononutu said that the sending of these telegrams is related to the tense international situation of last week that brought the world to the "brink of a new war." He said that the Indonesian government's wish is based in particular on the second and third of the ten principles of the Bandung Conference. The second principle is: "Respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all nations"; the third principle is: "Recognition of the equality of all races and the equality of all nations, large and small."

He said, "The Indonesian government believes that in the special circumstances that may endanger world peace, it has an obligation to strive to keep the spirit of the Bandung Conference alive and not to let it become a dead concept."

Mononutu also revealed that in order to strive for a peaceful resolution of the Suez Canal issue, similar contacts have also been made with Western countries using the Suez Canal, such as the United States, Britain, and France.

    印度尼西亚总理致电万隆会议国家
    希望共同努力解决苏伊士问题
    新华社雅加达25日电　印度尼西亚外交部发言人莫诺努图今天对报界说，印度尼西亚总理阿里·沙斯特罗阿米佐约已经打电报给参加去年万隆会议的国家的政府领袖，表示希望这些国家为争取和平解决苏伊士运河问题作共同的努力。
    沙斯特罗阿米佐约是去年亚非会议的主席。
    莫诺努图说，发出这些电报是同上星期的把世界带到“新战争边缘”的紧张国际局势有关。他说，印度尼西亚政府的这种愿望特别是根据万隆会议的十项原则中的第二项和第三项。第二项原则是：“尊重一切国家的主权和领土完整”；第三项原则是：“承认一切种族的平等、承认一切大小国家的平等。”
    他说，“印度尼西亚政府认为在可能危害世界和平的特殊情况下，有义务争取使万隆会议的精神继续生气勃勃，而不变为死的概念”。
    莫诺努图还透露，为了争取和平解决苏伊士运河问题，同使用苏伊士运河的西方国家如美国、英国和法国等也进行了同样的接触。
