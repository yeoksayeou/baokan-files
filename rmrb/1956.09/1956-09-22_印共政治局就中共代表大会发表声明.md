Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, September 21st: The Politburo of the Communist Party of India issued a statement on September 19th regarding the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China. The full text is as follows:

    We salute the historically significant Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, which is currently being held in Beijing. This is the first Party Congress held since the epoch-making victory of the glorious Chinese Revolution.

    Inspired by the Great October Revolution, the advanced and revolutionary forces of Chinese society embarked on the path illuminated by the world's first proletarian revolution. Thirty-five years ago, in 1921, the First National Congress of the Communist Party of China was held. This congress, representing only fifty-odd party members, was a small but historically significant beginning, containing revolutionary potential that few could have foreseen at the time.

    In the subsequent thirty-five years, the great Chinese people, under the correct leadership of their beloved Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, waged arduous struggles and achieved great victories.

    The Chinese Communists, under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism, fought with unparalleled heroism and self-sacrifice, and they were the most valiant pioneers of the entire Chinese nation. In the flames of these struggles, the Communist Party of China has been tempered into an invincible force and has formed its great revolutionary spirit. The victory of the Chinese People's Revolution seven years ago marked the end of an entire chapter of the Chinese people's persistent struggle and sacrifices for freedom and independence and against the rule of foreign imperialism and feudal reaction, and opened a new chapter—a chapter of transition to socialism.

    After overthrowing the corrupt Chiang Kai-shek regime and shattering all the chains of imperialist enslavement and feudal oppression, the liberated Chinese people are today engaged in large-scale construction work to transform their great motherland with the help of the great Soviet Union. Under the invincible banner of Marxism-Leninism, the Chinese people have now resolutely embarked on the road to socialism, and they are advancing forward with majestic steps.

    In industry and agriculture, in art and science, and indeed in all other aspects of Chinese life, one can see a tremendous upsurge of creative activity. The Chinese people have become the true masters of their country; it is for this reason that they can perform all kinds of miracles of creative labor.

    The Communist Party of China is the guiding force of this unprecedented upsurge, and it is the main organizer of all the magnificent creative activities of the great Chinese people.

    The Communist Party of China is loyal to the people and their cause. The leadership of the Communist Party of China over the affairs of the country and the national economy has resulted in the continuous improvement of the material and cultural conditions of the working people. Today, the people are enjoying the fruits of their labor. Due to the rapid realization of socialist transformation in industry and agriculture, the phenomenon of exploitation of man by man is about to become a thing of the past. In recent months, new and decisive victories have been achieved in socialist transformation.

    From their experience of life and struggle, the Chinese people understand that only socialism based on the power of the people's democratic state guarantees the realization of continuous progress and increasing prosperity in our era.

    In international affairs, the Chinese revolution and the emergence of the people's democratic state are events of profound historical significance. Such events mean a fatal blow to world imperialism and have greatly changed the balance of power in favor of colonial liberation.

    Under the influence of this evolution of profound world historical significance, the struggle for national liberation has gained irresistible speed and strength. Those countries that imperialism attempts to continue to control in changed political forms have been able to exercise their sovereignty and gain the status of independent nations.

    The rejuvenation of Asia would be unimaginable without the Chinese revolution and the role it plays today.

    The People's Republic of China has proven itself to be a great defender of world peace. In the short period of seven years, the People's Republic of China has made sublime contributions to the cause of peace, and this contribution has been praised by all progressive humanity. The growing friendship between the Chinese and Indian peoples based on Panchsheel and mutual benefit and cooperation is of historical significance.

    The People's Democratic Republic of China, led by the Communist Party of China, is thus strengthening the cause of peace and freedom, and strengthening the cause of Asian solidarity and friendship among the peoples of all countries.

    These are the great achievements made at home and abroad by the great Chinese people organized and led by the Communist Party of China. The Communist Party of China has inexhaustible strength because it firmly adheres to the principles of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, and because it is closely linked to the masses and loyal to the cause of the masses.

    Today, the Communist Party of China, representing 10.7 million party members and leading a country with a population of more than 600 million, is holding its Eighth National Congress after achieving such achievements and victories, in order to plan the future course of serving the Chinese people and all mankind.

    Once again, we salute this congress of victors, this congress held by the dearest friends of our great people, and wish them even more magnificent success in the cause of safeguarding peace, freedom, and human happiness.

    印共政治局就中共代表大会发表声明
    新华社新德里21日电　印度共产党政治局在9月19日就中国共产党第八次代表大会发表声明，全文如下：
    我们向现在正在北京举行会议的具有历史意义的中国共产党第八次代表大会致敬。这是光荣的中国革命取得划时代的胜利以来所举行的第一次党代表大会。
    在伟大的十月革命的鼓舞下，中国社会上先进的、革命的力量走上了世界上第一个无产阶级革命所照亮的道路。三十五年以前，在1921年举行了中国共产党第一次全国代表大会。这次仅仅代表着五十多个党员的代表大会是一个小小的然而具有历史意义的开端，它蕴藏着当时很少有人能够预见得到的革命潜力。
    在后来的三十五年中，伟大的中国人民在他们以毛泽东同志为首的敬爱的共产党的正确领导下进行了顽强的斗争，取得了伟大的胜利。
    中国共产党人在马克思列宁主义的指导下以无比的英雄气概和自我牺牲精神进行斗争，他们是整个中华民族最英勇的先驱。在这些斗争的烈火中，中国共产党已经百炼成钢，成为不可战胜的力量，并且形成了它那种伟大的革命气魄。七年以前中国人民革命的胜利，使得中国人民群众为了争取自由独立、反对外国帝国主义和封建反动势力的统治而进行坚持不懈的斗争和作出牺牲的整整一章宣告结束，同时又打开了新的一章——向社会主义过渡的一章。
    在推翻腐朽的蒋介石政权和粉碎帝国主义奴役和封建压迫的一切锁链以后，解放了的中国人民今天正在伟大苏联的帮助下从事改造他们伟大祖国的规模宏大的建设工作。中国人民在不可战胜的马克思列宁主义旗帜下，现在已经坚决地走上社会主义的道路，他们正踏着雄壮的步伐向前迈进。
    在工业和农业方面，在艺术和科学方面，实际上在中国生活的一切其他方面，人们都能看到创造性活动的巨大高潮。中国人民已经成为他们国家的真正的主人；正是由于这个原因，他们才能做出各种创造性劳动的奇迹。
    中国共产党是这种前所未有的高潮的指导力量，它是伟大中国人民一切宏伟的创造性活动的主要组织者。
    中国共产党忠于人民和他们的事业，中国共产党对国家的事务和国家的经济的领导使得劳动人民的物质和文化条件日益改善。今天是人民在享受自己的劳动果实。由于在工业和农业中迅速地实现了社会主义改造，人剥削人的现象快要成为过去。最近几个月内，在社会主义改造方面又取得了新的具有决定意义的胜利。
    中国人民从他们的生活和斗争的经验中了解，只有建立在人民民主国家权力的基础上的社会主义，才保证能够在我们这一个时代中实现不断的进步和日益兴旺的繁荣。
    在国际事务方面，中国的革命和人民民主国家的出现，是具有深刻历史意义的事件。这种事件意味着对于世界帝国主义的致命的打击，并且大大地改变了力量的对比而使它有利于殖民地的解放。
    在这种具有深刻世界历史意义的演变的影响下，争取民族解放的斗争就取得了不可抗拒的速度和力量。帝国主义企图以改变了的政治形式继续控制的那些国家，已经有可能行使自己的主权并且获得独立国家的地位了。
    如果没有中国的革命以及中国革命在今天所发挥的作用，亚洲的复兴是不能想像的。
    中华人民共和国已经证明自己是世界和平的伟大的捍卫者。在短短的七年期间内，中华人民共和国就对和平事业作出了崇高的贡献，这种贡献受到了全体进步人类的称赞。以潘查希拉和互利合作为基础的中印两国人民的日益增长的友谊是具有历史意义的。
    中国共产党所领导的人民民主国家，就是这样在加强和平和自由的事业，加强亚洲团结和各国人民友好的事业的。
    这就是由中国共产党组织起来并且在它的领导下的伟大的中国人民在国内和国外所取得的伟大的成就。中国共产党所以有无尽的力量，是由于它坚定地遵守马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义的原则，由于它密切地联系群众和忠于群众的事业。
    今天，代表着一千零七十万党员并且领导着一个拥有六亿多人口的国家的中国共产党，就是在取得了这样一些成就和胜利之后来举行第八次代表大会来策划今后为中国人民和全人类服务的路线的。
    我们再一次向这一次胜利者的代表大会，向伟大的我国人民的最亲爱的朋友们所举行的这一次代表大会致敬，同时预祝他们在维护和平、自由和人类幸福的事业中取得更加宏伟的成功。
