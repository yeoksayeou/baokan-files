Xinhua News Agency, 26th. Huang Gangcun, a Chiang army personnel who had served in the Kuomintang army for nineteen years and rose from soldier to Air Force Major, drove an airplane to revolt and return from Taiwan. Tonight in Beijing, he was warmly welcomed by more than 900 representatives from all walks of life. At the meeting, the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army awarded him a bonus of 8,000 yuan.

Huang Gangcun was a Major instructor at the Taiwan Chiang Army Air Force Military Academy. On August 15th, he drove an AT-6 advanced trainer aircraft from Gangshan Airport in Taiwan, revolted and flew back to the mainland of the motherland, landing safely in a certain area of Fujian Province. After Huang Gangcun's uprising and return, he visited Fuzhou, Shanghai and other places. He arrived in Beijing a week ago. Huang Gangcun joined the Kuomintang army as a soldier in 1937. In 1944, he was sent to the United States for one year of air force training. He went to Taiwan on the eve of the national mainland liberation in 1949. In the nineteen years before this uprising and return, he never left the Kuomintang army.

At the welcome rally, the Kuomintang Air Force Major who revolted and returned said that from Fujian to Beijing, for more than a month, he had been warmly welcomed and received by the people of the motherland in various parts of the country. His grateful feelings cannot be expressed in words. He said that in July this year, he saw fragments of the People's Government's call for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan between the lines of Taiwanese newspapers, which made him realize that the government and people of the motherland had not forgotten this group of people who had taken the wrong path, and that the Kuomintang army personnel living a humiliating life under American control also needed the understanding and love of the motherland. Therefore, despite having a wife and children in Taiwan, he still endured the pain of temporary separation from his wife and children and resolutely risked flying back to the mainland of the motherland. At the meeting, Huang Gangcun angrily denounced the rampant arrogance of American soldiers in Taiwan, citing many facts of American troops insulting Taiwanese women and humiliating the wives and daughters of Chiang army officers, which aroused the indignation of the people present.

The welcome rally was presided over by Major General Zhang Zizhen, representative of the General Political Department. Zhang Zizhen said at the meeting that we have held many such welcome meetings this year in Beijing, Guangzhou, Fujian, and Yunnan. Some of the returning Chiang army officers and soldiers drove airplanes, opened steamers, and even swam back with wooden basins, car tires, basketballs, wooden stakes, etc. Some returned from the United States via Japan, Hong Kong, and other places. People from the Chiang army's army, navy, and air force have returned to the mainland, reunited with their families, and have been properly resettled. Zhang Zizhen said, we believe that there are many patriots in the Kuomintang army personnel in Taiwan. In the future, we will continue to adhere to the principle of "patriotism as one family" and "patriotism regardless of order," and welcome Kuomintang army personnel to return individually or collectively. The government will properly resettle them and give them due rewards according to the differences in their contributions.

Zheng Dongguo, a member of the National Defense Commission, won warm applause for his speech at the meeting. He said that he hoped to meet some of his classmates and friends who are still in Taiwan in the capital soon. Zheng Dongguo said that do not think that the peaceful liberation of Taiwan is only beneficial to the mainland. In fact, the method of peaceful liberation is beneficial to the people of Taiwan and to the Kuomintang army personnel. The treatment Huang Gangcun and other uprising personnel have received is a good example. Hou Jingru, representative of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, said at the meeting that he hoped that the military and political personnel in Taiwan would respond to the call issued by the motherland, act in the spirit of patriotism as one family, and make contributions to the peaceful liberation of Taiwan and the completion of the great cause of reunification of the motherland. The motherland will warmly welcome their patriotic actions.

Guan Shixiong, vice chairman of the Beijing Municipal Democratic Youth Federation, and Huang Gangcun's brother, Huang Fengcun, both spoke at the meeting.

Huang Gangcun's father and younger brother, who came to Beijing from his hometown of Xiajin County, Shandong Province, attended the welcome rally. Huang Tiejun, a friend of Huang Gangcun from Taiwan and a former Chiang army air force personnel who had revolted and returned, also attended the meeting.

    北京各界代表九百多人举行欢迎大会
    欢迎蒋军空军少校黄纲存驾机起义归来
    中国人民解放军总政治部发给他奖金八千元
    新华社26日讯　在国民党军队中一直干了十九年，由士兵升到空军少校的蒋军人员黄纲存，驾驶飞机由台湾起义归来，今天晚上在北京受到各界代表九百多人的热烈欢迎。会上，中国人民解放军总政治部发给他八千元奖金。
    黄纲存是台湾蒋军空军军官学校的少校教官，他在8月15日由台湾冈山机场驾驶AT—6型高级教练机起义飞回祖国大陆，在福建省某地安全降落。黄纲存起义归来后，曾先后到福州、上海等地参观游览，一个星期前到达了北京。黄纲存在1937年就到国民党军队里当兵，1944年曾被送往美国受一年的空军训练，1949年全国大陆解放前夕去了台湾。在这次起义归来前的十九年中，他一直没有离开过国民党军队。
    在欢迎大会上，这位起义归来的国民党空军少校说，从福建到北京，一个多月来，他在祖国各地都受到祖国人民的热情欢迎和接待，他感激的心情不是言语所能表达的。他说，今年七月间，他在台湾报纸的字里行间看到了人民政府关于和平解放台湾的号召的片断，使他知道祖国政府和人民都没有忘记他们这一群走错了路的人，而在美国控制下过着屈辱生活的国民党军队人员，也需要祖国的谅解和爱护。因此他尽管有妻子儿女在台湾，但仍忍受着与妻儿暂时分别的痛苦，毅然冒险飞回祖国大陆。黄纲存在会上愤怒地控诉美国军人在台湾横行霸道，列举了许多美军侮辱台湾妇女和凌辱蒋军军官妻女的事实，激起了到会人们的愤慨。
    欢迎大会由总政治部代表张梓桢少将主持。张梓桢在会上说，在北京、广州、福建、云南，今年我们举行过不少这样的欢迎会。归来的蒋军官兵有的是驾飞机、开汽船甚至扶着木盆、汽车胎、篮球、木桩等游水归来的，也有从美国经过日本、香港等地回来的。蒋军陆、海、空军都有人回到大陆来，他们都已和家人团聚，并且获得了妥善的安置。张梓桢说，我们相信，在台湾的国民党军队人员中不乏爱国人士。今后我们仍本“爱国一家”、“爱国不分先后”的原则，一律欢迎国民党军队人员个别或集体归来，政府将予以妥善安置，并且按照贡献的不同给以应得的奖励。
    国防委员会委员郑洞国在会上的讲话博得了热烈的掌声。他说，他希望很快地能和现在尚留在台湾的某些同学们、朋友们在首都相见。郑洞国说，不要以为和平解放台湾只是对大陆上有利，其实和平解放的方式对台湾人民和对国民党军队人员都是有利的，黄纲存和其他起义人员受到的待遇就是很好的例子。中国国民党革命委员会代表侯镜如在会上说，希望在台湾的军政人员响应祖国发出的号召，本着爱国一家的精神，为和平解放台湾、完成祖国的统一大业作出贡献，祖国将热烈欢迎他们的爱国行动。
    北京市民主青年联合会副主席关世雄和黄纲存的哥哥黄俸存都在会上讲了话。
    从山东省夏津县故乡赶到北京的黄纲存的父亲、弟弟等都参加了欢迎大会。黄纲存在台湾时的朋友、以前起义归来的蒋军空军人员黄铁骏也参加了大会。
