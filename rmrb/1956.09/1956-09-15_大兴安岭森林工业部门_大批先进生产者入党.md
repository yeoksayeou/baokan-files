Xinhua News Agency, Yakutsk, September 13th. From January to August this year, more than 580 employees of various ethnic groups in the Greater Khingan Range forest industry sector joined the Communist Party of China.

Many of the forest industry workers who joined the Communist Party are advanced producers. According to statistics from the Party committees of the Tu Li River, Xiniqi, and Kuduer Forest Industry Bureaus, more than 50% of the 271 new party members developed in the first half of this year were advanced producers. Zhu Cheng, a young loading worker at the North Storage Yard of the Tu Li River Forest Industry Bureau, formulated a progressive plan for 1956 to 1957 in the socialist labor competition. Thanks to the constant education of the Party branch and his own efforts, his political consciousness has been greatly improved. Moreover, he worked hard and created the "string-head counter-bending loading method," which increased the loading capacity of each train car from 32 cubic meters to 37.3 cubic meters, saving the country 30 train car loads in April. He has been repeatedly selected as an advanced producer and joined the Communist Party of China on June 27.

    大兴安岭森林工业部门
    大批先进生产者入党
    新华社牙克石13日电　今年1月到8月份，大兴安岭的森林工业部门，有五百八十多名各族职工加入了中国共产党。
    参加共产党的森林工业职工中有很多是先进生产者。据中共图里河、西尼气、库都尔三个森林工业局党委的统计，今年上半年在新发展的二百七十一名党员中，50％以上是先进生产者。图里河森林工业局北贮木场的青年装车工人朱诚，在社会主义劳动竞赛中订立了1956年到1957年的进步计划，由于党支部的经常教育和他自己的努力，他的政治觉悟有了很大提高，而且苦心钻研，创造了“串头对弯装车法”，使每节火车皮的装载量由三十二立方公尺提高到三十七点三立方公尺，在4月份便给国家节约了三十个车皮的装载量。他曾连续被选为先进生产者，并且在6月27日加入了中国共产党。
