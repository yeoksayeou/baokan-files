The Story of a Pine Tree
　　——A Folk Tale
　　Dong Junlun, Jiang Yuan
　　
　　Once upon a time, in an unknown place, there was a high mountain covered in strange rocks. At the top of the mountain, there was a dark cave. Inside lived a spotted tiger, with piercing eyes and a white forehead, incredibly strong, and when it got angry, its roar would shake the mountains. At the foot of the mountain was a large, deep pool, the water of which was a dark, murky green. Inside lived a large turtle, and when it got angry, just lifting its shell could stir up waves, and stretching its head would make it more than ten feet long. On the mountainside, there was an ancient pine tree, its trunk twisted and crooked, at least several dozen feet tall. It strained to spread its branches, fearing that smaller trees would grow up beside it.

　　The tiger on the mountain and the turtle in the pool had been good friends for many years. They were so close that they missed each other after only a few days apart, and would visit each other once or twice every three days. Each time they visited, whether the tiger came down the mountain or the turtle went up, they would always pause slightly under the pine tree on the mountainside to say hello. The pine tree would always mumble a response, but in its heart, it was very jealous. It was not happy that the tiger was strong, not happy that the turtle was powerful, and even less happy that the two were so friendly. It was always secretly scheming: how to harm them, how to turn them into enemies. The old pine tree racked its brains and came up with a plan. But it overexerted itself thinking about this, and half of its trunk withered and turned black, and the pine needles also turned yellow.

　　One day, the turtle went up the mountain again to see the tiger. When it reached the pine tree, before it could even say hello, the pine tree spoke first: "Brother Turtle, where are you going?" The turtle said: "I'm going to see Brother Tiger." The pine tree suddenly sighed heavily. The turtle was surprised and suspicious: "Brother Pine Tree, why are you sighing?" The pine tree sighed again before saying: "If you ask me, you shouldn't go to see it." The turtle was even more puzzled: "Why shouldn't I go to see it?" The pine tree lowered its voice and said: "You don't know, but the tiger was scolding you on the mountain yesterday. The things it said about you were simply unbearable." The turtle quickly asked: "What did it say about me?" The pine tree said mysteriously: "But don't get angry when you hear this, it called you a turtle brat, and said that when you go up the mountain again, it will crack open your shell and drink your marrow." As soon as the turtle heard this, it immediately turned around angrily, stretching its head back to the pool.

　　The tiger waited and waited in its cave, muttering to itself: "Why hasn't my turtle brother come yet?" It walked out of the cave and looked again and again, but still didn't see the turtle's shadow. "Maybe I should go to see it." After making this decision, the tiger leaped and bounded down the mountain. The pine tree stopped it and said: "Brother Tiger, where are you going?" The tiger said: "Today, my turtle brother said he would come to see me, but I don't know why he didn't come, so I thought I'd go and see him." The pine tree sighed heavily again. The tiger was also surprised and suspicious: "Brother Pine Tree, why are you sighing?" The pine tree sighed again before saying: "If you ask me, you shouldn't go to see it." The tiger was even more puzzled: "Why shouldn't I go to see it?" The pine tree said in a low voice: "You don't know, but it was just here scolding you just now, and the things it said about you were simply unbearable." The tiger quickly asked: "What did it say about me?" The pine tree said even more mysteriously: "It called you a tiger brat, saying that when you go to its place, it will bite your claws, pull your legs, drag you into the water, and drown you." As soon as the tiger heard this, it also turned around angrily, flicked its tail, and leaped back up to the mountain top.

　　From then on, many days passed, and the tiger and the turtle no longer interacted. But the tiger had a fiery temper, and the more it thought about it, the angrier it became, and finally couldn't hold back anymore. It leaped out of its cave and went straight to the big pool.

　　The pine tree was so happy that it almost laughed out loud.

　　Before the tiger even reached the edge of the pool, it started cursing: "You turtle brat, why do you want to bite my claws, pull my legs, and drag me into the pool to drown me?"

　　The turtle also stuck its head out of the water and cursed: "You tiger brat, why do you want to bite my shell and drink my marrow?"

　　The two cursed more and more fiercely, without even thinking of clarifying the facts, and started fighting. After two or three rounds, the turtle bit the tiger's claws and dragged it into the pool; the tiger also bit the turtle's shell and held on with all its might. Before long, the turtle was bitten to death, and the tiger also drowned.

　　The next morning, the dead tiger and the dead turtle both floated to the surface of the water. A young man was passing by and gathered many people, who fished them out and carried them home. The group discussed: "It will take a lot of firewood to cook such a big tiger and turtle." When the young man heard this, he led several people, carrying saws and axes, up the mountain.

　　When they reached the mountainside, the young man stopped and looked at the ancient pine tree, saying to his companions: "This old pine tree is already half withered, and it won't grow any more if we leave it. On the contrary, it's suppressing the other small trees. Cutting it down will be enough to burn." So everyone immediately set to work and felled the big pine tree.

　　This is the story of a pine tree.

    一棵松树的故事
    ——民间故事
    董均伦　江源
    从前，不知在什么地方有一座怪石重叠的高山。山顶上，有一个黑漆漆的山洞。里面住着一只斑毛大虎，长得吊睛白额，力大无比，暴躁起来，叫一声，山动地摇。山脚下有一个很大的深潭，潭里的水是墨绿墨绿的。里面住着一只大鳖，它生起气来，盖一掀就能搅起浪头，头一伸就有一丈多长。山半坡上，有一棵千年老松树，树干弯弯曲曲，少说也有几十丈高，它拼着老力伸展着树枝，生怕小树在它身旁长起来。
    山上的老虎和潭里的大鳖，已经是多年的好朋友了。两个好得几天不见面就想得慌，不过三天就要互相看望一次两次。每次看望，无论是老虎下山，或是大鳖上山，在必定走过山半坡的松树底下时，总要略略逗留，向松树问个好。松树每次唔唔啊啊地答应着，心里却很嫉妒。它不高兴老虎有力气，不高兴大鳖有劲，更不高兴它们两个那么和好。它老是暗暗算计着：怎样害它两个，怎样使它两个变成仇敌。老松树费尽心血，想出了办法。可是它为这事用心过度，树干有一半枯朽变黑了，松针也变黄了。
    这一天，大鳖又到山顶去看老虎。走到松树底下，它还没来得及向松树问好，松树就先说话了：“鳖大哥，你到哪里去呀？”大鳖说：“我去看老虎哥呀。”松树忽然用力地叹了一口气。大鳖惊疑起来：“松树大哥，你为什么叹气呀？”松树又长叹了一口气才开口道：
  “依我说，你就不去看它吧。”大鳖更加奇怪了：“我为什么不去看它呢？”松树压低声音说：“你是不知道呀，老虎昨天在山顶上骂你呢，它骂你的话，简直没法听啦。”大鳖连忙追问：“它都骂我些什么？”松树很神秘地说：“可是你听了不要生气呀，它骂你是鳖羔子，等你再上山去，它就要啃破你的盖，喝了你的黄。”大鳖一听，气得立刻掉转身子，头一伸一伸地回潭里去了。
    老虎在山洞里，等了又等，自言自语说道：“我那个鳖兄弟怎么还没来呢。”它走出洞来，看了又看，还是不见大鳖的影子。“还是我去看它去吧。”老虎决定后就一蹿一跳地向山下跑去。松树叫住它说：“虎大哥，你往哪里去呀？”老虎说：“今天，我那鳖兄弟说去看我，不知为什么没去，我想还是我去看看它吧。”松树又用力叹了一口气。老虎也惊疑起来：“松树哥，你为什么叹气呀？”松树还是长叹了一口气才开口道：“依我说，你就不去看它吧。”老虎也更奇怪了：“我为什么不去看它呢？”松树低声说道：“你是不知道呀，刚才它还在这里骂你哪，它骂你的那些话，简直没法听啊。”老虎也连忙追问：“它骂我些什么呀？”松树更是神秘地说：“骂你是虎羔子，说等你去它那里，就要咬你的爪，拉你的腿，拖你到水里，把你淹死。”老虎一听，也气得立刻掉转身子，尾巴一撅，就向山顶蹿去了。
    从这以后，好多日子过去了，老虎和大鳖没再来往。但是老虎火性大，越寻思越生气，再也憋不住了，就一跃蹿出了洞，扑大潭那里去了。
    松树乐得差点笑出声来。
    老虎还没到潭边就骂开了：“我把你这鳖羔子，你为什么要咬我的爪，拉我的腿，把我拖进潭里淹死？”
    大鳖也从水里伸出头来骂：“我把你这虎羔子，你为什么要咬我的盖，喝我的黄？”
    两个越骂越激烈，也没想到弄清事实，就斗起来了。三斗两斗，大鳖咬着老虎的爪，把它坠到潭里去了；老虎也咬住大鳖的盖，死劲不放。没多一会，大鳖被咬死了，老虎也淹死了。
    第二天早晨，死老虎和死大鳖都浮到了水面上。有一个小伙子从这里路过，找来了许多人，把它们捞起来抬回家去了。大伙商议道：“煮这么大的虎、鳖，可得许多柴火呀。”小伙子一听，领着好几个人，拿着锯呀、斧子的上了山。
    到了山半腰，小伙子站住打量了一下那棵千年老松树，对伙伴们说道：“这棵老松树已经枯干了一半啦，留着它也不能长了，反倒把别的小树压住，砍了它就够烧的了。”于是大伙立刻动手，把那大松树砍倒了。
    这就是一棵松树的故事。
