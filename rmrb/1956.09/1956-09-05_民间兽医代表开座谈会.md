A symposium for representatives of folk veterinarians, organized by the Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Bureau of the Ministry of Agriculture, began in Beijing on September 3rd. The representatives attending included famous veterinarians from various provinces and cities (such as Gao Guojin from Shanxi, Li Shunru from Guangxi, Pan Junsheng from Liaoning, Chang Bingyi from Gansu, etc.), personnel leading veterinary work, and personnel from veterinary science research institutes. Among the folk veterinarian representatives present, more than half were over fifty years old, and there were also three elderly people in their seventies. They all felt that they could contribute their many years of experience to the socialist cause and that they were indescribably excited to be able to attend a meeting in Beijing.

During the symposium on the afternoon of September 3rd, the speeches of two representatives were particularly noteworthy. Huang Shuren, the station chief (and technical advisor) of the animal protection station in Mixian County, Henan, said: "My grandfather was originally a good veterinarian; by my father's generation, he would rather carry a small load than do this profession. They often told me: when you grow up, no matter what you do, don't be a veterinarian; if you do this profession, everyone will look down on you, and your children and grandchildren will not be successful; the family of a veterinarian cannot marry into a good family, and cannot enter the examination hall... It was not until after liberation that veterinarians had a glorious position in society." Yang Yuehe, a famous veterinarian who treats wry neck, bloat, and glanders, said: "My family has been veterinarians for three generations. When my father taught me the special acupuncture methods and secret prescriptions for treating these diseases, he said: having these few techniques is enough for you to live on for the rest of your life. In the past, I was very unwilling to tell others about these techniques. Now, the People's Government thinks so highly of veterinarians, letting me attend meetings in the county, attend meetings in the province, and now come to Beijing for meetings, I am really happy! I have already dedicated the secret prescription passed down from my ancestors in the province, and I will also have a good exchange of experiences with other representatives here."

    民间兽医代表开座谈会
    本报讯　农业部畜牧兽医总局召开的全国民间兽医座谈会，9月3日在北京开始举行。到会代表有各省市的名兽医（如山西的高国晋、广西的李顺儒、辽宁的潘骏声、甘肃的常丙彝等等）、领导兽医工作的工作人员、兽医科学研究所的人员。在到会的民间兽医代表中间，五十岁以上的占一半以上，还有三位七十多岁的老人。他们都感到：能把多年的经验贡献给社会主义事业，能到北京开会，有说不出的兴奋。
    9月3日下午的座谈会上，有两位代表的发言最引人注意：河南密县保畜站的站长（兼技术指导）黄寿任说：“我祖父原是一个好兽医；到父亲一代宁肯担小挑也不干这一行了。他们常嘱咐我：长大以后，无论干什么，也不要当兽医；干了这一行，谁都瞧不起，儿孙后代也都成不了器；兽医家的人不能和好户结亲，并且不能进考场……直到解放以后，兽医才在社会上有了光荣的地位。”治疗转头疯、气鼓、鼻疽的名兽医杨月合说：“我家是祖传三代兽医。父亲传授我治这几种病的特效针灸法和秘方的时候说：有这几样技术，够你一辈子活了。我过去很不愿意把这些技术告诉别人。现在，人民政府对兽医看得这样高，让我到县里开会，到省里开会，又来北京开会，心里真高兴！我在省里已经献出了祖传的秘方，在这里还要好好和别的代表交流经验。”
