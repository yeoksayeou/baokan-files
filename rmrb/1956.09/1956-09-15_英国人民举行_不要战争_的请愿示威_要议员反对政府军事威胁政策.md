Xinhua News Agency, London, September 13th: As Parliament began to debate the Suez Canal issue, the British people launched a large-scale "No War" petition movement to Parliament.

Starting at 2:00 PM on September 12th, representatives of British working people from all over the country began to gather in the square in front of the Houses of Parliament in London. They met with members of parliament in the parliamentary lounge, unanimously demanding that parliamentarians oppose the British government's policy of military threats in Parliament.

That evening, the British Peace Committee and the "Suez Canal Emergency Committee" held a demonstration and rally. Demonstrators shouted: "We don't want war!" "We advocate consultation!" The demonstrators also demanded Eden's resignation and further negotiations with Egypt to resolve the Suez Canal issue.

At the same time, protest movements are also being widely launched throughout Britain to oppose Western countries' attempts to use force to resolve the Suez Canal issue.
