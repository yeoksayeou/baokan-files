    Do a Better Job in Old Revolutionary Base Areas
    Speech by Comrade Jiang Yizhen, Secretary of the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China
    I would now like to talk about the work in the old revolutionary base areas of Fujian. The old areas of Fujian have a population of three million, accounting for about a quarter of the province's population. Most of them were originally the Central Soviet Area, and areas with more than one million people underwent land reform. After the main force of the Red Army went north to fight against Japan, the Party in Fujian adhered to Comrade Mao Zedong's correct line. Encouraged by the ever-developing national revolutionary situation, it closely united and relied on the masses, overcame various difficulties, and persisted in armed struggle until the victory of the whole country. It realized the glorious wish of the people in the old areas to "keep the red flag flying" and "persist until dawn." In the more than twenty years of struggle, the people in the old areas of Fujian suffered severe devastation from the enemy. In the Minxi area alone, 90,000 revolutionary people died directly under the enemy's knives, and thousands of villages were reduced to ruins. The counter-revolutionaries' brutality caused many difficulties for the production and life of the people in the old areas.
    Promote Revolutionary Traditions and Strive for Greater Glory
    In 1949, when the People's Liberation Army marched south, the people in the old areas of Fujian welcomed them like long-separated relatives, with enthusiastic welcomes everywhere saying, "You are back." They used all their strength to support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Fujian and liberating the whole country. In the years after liberation, the people in the old areas responded to Chairman Mao's call to "promote revolutionary traditions and strive for greater glory," and continued to carry forward the glorious revolutionary traditions of the past, actively taking the lead in both the struggle against the enemy and in production and construction. In the struggles to suppress bandits, implement land reform, and suppress counter-revolutionaries, the people in the old areas were particularly brave, tenacious, and active. In the work of restoring production, rebuilding homes, and socialist transformation of agriculture, they had many difficulties, but they encouraged each other in this way: "The difficult days of the past are over, what is this difficulty now?" Thanks to the efforts of the people in the old areas, and also to the enthusiastic support of the masses in the new areas and the necessary assistance from the state in many aspects, production in most of the old areas has now been restored. Thousands of villages that were destroyed by the enemy have been rebuilt, the population is also increasing year by year, and the material and cultural lives of the masses have also been improved. After the launch of the agricultural socialist transformation movement, the masses in the old areas were even more excited. Many elderly farmers and young activists who had participated in the farming teams in the past took the lead in setting up cooperatives. Now the degree of cooperativization in the old areas has reached more than 90 percent. In recent years, the political awareness of the people in the old areas has been increasing day by day. A large number of old revolutionary comrades and activists have been promoted to various leadership positions. In addition, the Party membership of some old Party members who had lost contact with the Party was restored based on conditions. Through these efforts, the unity between the Party and the people in the old areas has been consolidated and strengthened, and the political enthusiasm of the people in the old areas has been further brought into play.
    Help Old Revolutionary Base Areas Solve Difficulties in All Aspects
    Now, the various construction undertakings in the old areas, together with the general areas, are gradually realizing the "National Agricultural Development Program" (draft), building a prosperous new socialist countryside to meet the long-standing expectations of the people in the old areas.
    However, because the economy of the old areas was severely damaged, the economy of a small number of old base villages has not yet recovered, and the production and life of the masses are still facing some difficulties. To solve these problems, first of all, we must rely on the strength of organization to vigorously develop production, especially the development of diversified economic production. Most of the old areas are mountainous areas, with many kinds of local and special products. Developing local and special products is a major way for the people in the old areas to increase their income, and more attention should be paid to this in the future. Secondly, attention should be paid to increasing the labor force in the old areas. This mainly involves continuing to strengthen the construction of health services in the old areas, gradually eliminating those diseases that are prevalent in the mountainous areas, and enhancing the physical strength of the people in the old areas. At the same time, according to old habits and the principle of voluntary mutual benefit, organize the surplus labor force in the plains areas to participate in seasonal production in the mountainous areas; organize the surplus labor force in the plains areas to immigrate to the old areas on a voluntary basis to increase the labor force in the old areas. Thirdly, in terms of economy, we must continue to support the people in the old areas from various aspects. The economic, cultural, and educational departments of the provincial, prefectural, and county governments should give more support to the old areas in economic and cultural construction. The old areas also need more investment in the restoration and development of local and special product production. The state can provide loans with a longer period of time to assist them, and give preferential treatment in the purchase price. The state should continue to help the small number of old base villages whose economies have not yet recovered, so that they can quickly catch up with the general old areas. There are more widowed, orphaned, and solitary family members of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers in the old areas. In the future, the state should continue to provide long-term relief to them in general, so as to avoid overburdening the "five guarantees" of the agricultural cooperatives in the old areas. In addition, we can also promote the exchange of materials between new and old areas, and between plains and mountainous areas, by establishing mountain markets and gradually improving traffic and transportation conditions in the mountainous areas, so as to increase the income of the people in the old areas.
    Strengthen Ideological and Organizational Leadership Over Work in the Old Areas
    The masses in the old areas have been tested by long-term struggles. A group of old Party members and activists who survived the long and cruel struggles are the reliable backbone for us to build the old areas. However, some of our comrades who work in the old areas one-sidedly exaggerate some of the complexities of the old areas, and underestimate the most basic glorious revolutionary traditions of the masses in the old areas. They only recognize the old revolutionary comrades who went north to fight against Japan and those who have sacrificed as "hard bones" (resolutely revolutionary), and indiscriminately regard the old revolutionary activists who still remain in the local area as "soft bones" (wavering elements) or "bad bones" (rebellious elements). This erroneous attitude has affected the correct handling of the political problems of some old revolutionary comrades, and has also affected the full mobilization of the enthusiasm of the old revolutionary masses. In response to the above problems, the Provincial Party Committee has strengthened ideological and organizational leadership over work in the old areas: first, it has strengthened the education of cadres from other places who work in the old areas, so that they can understand the role of the old areas in revolutionary history, understand the principle of "when drinking water, think of its source," thereby improving their understanding, unifying policies and ideas, and establishing the concept of relying on the cadres and masses in the old areas to build the old areas. Second, it has strengthened the training and education of old revolutionary comrades, and continued to select a group of outstanding people to participate in the party and government leadership work of local counties, districts, and townships. At the same time, according to the characteristics of the old revolutionary comrades and activists in the old areas who have a lower level of cultural theory, a long-term plan has been formulated to educate them. Third, some organizational problems left over from the long-term struggle in the old areas will continue to be dealt with in accordance with the principle of being active and cautious. For those comrades who have consistently persisted in the struggle and actively worked after liberation, their Party membership will be restored if they lost their organizational relationship in the past due to certain objective reasons. As for the phenomenon of individual organizations in the old areas being impure, they are being rectified separately according to specific circumstances.
    We believe that, based on the Party Central Committee's policies and guidelines, and closely relying on the masses in the old areas, after further properly handling the above-mentioned problems, we will certainly be able to more fully mobilize the socialist enthusiasm of the masses in the old areas and do a good job in the construction of the old areas.

    把老革命根据地的工作作得更好
    中共福建省委员会书记　江一真同志的发言
    我现在谈一谈福建老根据地工作问题。福建老区有三百万人口，约占全省人口四分之一。其中大部分为原来的中央苏区，有一百多万人口的地区经过土地革命。红军主力北上抗日后，福建的党坚持了毛泽东同志的正确路线，在日益发展的全国革命形势的鼓舞下，紧密地团结和依靠群众，战胜了各种困难，坚持武装斗争到全国胜利。实现了老区人民“红旗不倒”、“坚持到天亮”的光荣愿望。福建老区人民在这二十多年的斗争中，遭受了敌人严重的摧残，仅闽西地区，直接死于敌人屠刀下的革命群众有九万人，数千个村庄化为废墟。反革命的残暴，给老区人民的生产、生活造成了很多困难。
    发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣
    一九四九年解放军向南进军，福建老区人民像欢迎久别的亲人一样地迎接他们，到处是“你们回来了”的热情欢迎。以全部力量，来支援解放军解放福建、解放全国的斗争。解放后几年来，老区人民响应毛主席“发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣”的号召，无论在对敌斗争中或是在生产建设中，都继续发扬了过去的光荣革命传统，积极地走在前头。在剿匪、土地改革、镇压反革命等斗争中，老区人民特别英勇、顽强、积极。在恢复生产、重建家园和农业社会主义改造工作中，他们是有许多困难的，但他们都这样地互相勉励：“从前那样困难的日子都过去了，现在这点困难算什么”。由于老区人民的努力，还由于新区群众的热情支援和国家从多方面的给以必要的扶助。现在，大部分老区的生产恢复了，数千个遭受敌人毁灭性摧残的村庄已重建起来，人口亦在逐年上升，群众物质生活和文化生活也都有了改善。在农业社会主义改造运动展开后，老区群众更加兴奋，许多从前参加过耕田队的老年农民和青年积极分子一起带头办社。现在老区合作化的程度，已经达到百分之九十以上。几年来老区人民的政治觉悟日益提高，许多老革命同志和积极分子，已大批的被提拔到各种领导工作岗位上来。此外，还根据条件，恢复了一些失去党关系的老党员的党籍。通过这些工作，巩固和加强了党与老区人民的团结，进一步发挥了老区人民的政治积极性。
    从各方面帮助老革命根据地解决困难
    现在，老区的各项建设事业，正和一般地区一起，逐步地实现“全国农业发展纲要”（草案）建设繁荣的社会主义新农村，以满足老区人民多年来的期望。
    但是，因老区经济遭受严重破坏，少数老基点村经济尚未恢复，群众生产、生活都还有一些困难。要解决这些问题，首先，必须依靠组织起来的力量，大力发展生产，特别是发展多种经济生产。老区大部是山区，土特产种类很多，发展土特产，是使老区人民增加收入的一个主要方面，今后要予以更多的注意。其次，要注意增加老区的劳力。这主要是继续加强老区的卫生事业的建设，逐渐消灭那些在山区流行的疾病，增强老区人民的体力。同时根据旧有习惯和自愿互利原则，组织平原地区的剩余劳动力参加山区季节性的生产；组织平原地区剩余劳力，在自愿原则下向老区移民，以增加老区的劳力。再次，在经济方面，要继续从多方面来支援老区人民。省、专、县三级政府的经济和文教等部门，在经济文化建设中，要予老区以较多的支持；老区在恢复和发展土特产生产当中，还需要有较大的投资，国家可给以时间较长的贷款，加以扶助，并在收购价格上予以照顾；对少数经济尚未恢复的老基点村，国家继续给予帮助，使之迅速赶上一般老区；老区鳏、寡、孤、独的烈军属较多，今后一般仍须由国家予以长期救济，以免老区农业社的“五保”负担过重。此外，还可通过建立山区市场，逐渐改善山区交通运输条件，来促进新区与老区、平原与山区的物资交流，增加老区人民的收入。
    加强了对老区工作的思想领导和组织领导
    老区群众经过长期斗争考验，在长期残酷斗争中保存下来的一批老党员和老积极分子，他们是我们建设老区可靠的骨干。但是，我们有些在老区工作的同志，片面地夸大老区的某些复杂性，而对老区群众的最基本的光荣革命传统估计不足。他们只把北上抗日和已经牺牲的老革命同志认作“硬骨头”（坚决革命），而把仍留在当地的老革命积极分子不加区别的一律看作是“软骨头”（动摇分子）或“坏骨头”（叛变分子）。这种错误态度，曾影响到对一些老革命同志的政治问题的正确处理，也影响到对老革命群众积极性的充分调动。针对上述问题，省委已加强了对老区工作的思想领导和组织领导：首先加强了对在老区工作的外地干部的教育，使他们认识老区在革命历史中的作用，懂得“饮水思源”的道理，从而提高认识，统一政策思想，确立依靠老区干部和群众建设老区的观念。第二，加强了对老革命同志的培养教育，继续选拔一批优秀分子参加当地县、区、乡的党政领导工作。同时根据老区的老革命同志和积极分子文化理论水平较低的特点，制订长期规划，予以教育。第三，老区在长期斗争中，遗留下来的若干组织问题，还要根据积极慎重的方针，继续进行处理。对于那些一贯坚持斗争，解放后又积极工作的同志，过去因为某些客观原因失去组织关系的，恢复他们的党籍；至于老区个别组织不纯的现象，正分别具体情况进行整顿。
    我们相信，我们依据党中央的方针政策，紧紧地依靠老区群众，在进一步妥善处理上述问题之后，一定可以更充分地把老区群众的社会主义积极性调动起来，把老区建设工作做好。
