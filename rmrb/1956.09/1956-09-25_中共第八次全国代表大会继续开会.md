Xinhua News Agency, September 24th: The Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China continued this afternoon.

	Cai Chang (First Secretary of the Women's Work Committee of the CPC Central Committee) spoke first, expressing her views on the cultivation and promotion of female cadres, and giving full play to their enthusiasm and creativity.
	Jia Tuofu (Director of the Fourth Office of the State Council) expressed his views on several issues related to the development of light industry.
	Li Fuchun (Vice Premier of the State Council and Director of the State Planning Commission) pointed out some issues that must be paid attention to in order to improve the level of planning work, based on the experience and lessons learned from the past national economic planning work in his speech.
	Li Xuefeng (Minister of the Industrial and Transportation Work Department of the CPC Central Committee) expressed his views on the work of the Party in state-owned industrial enterprises.
	Hu Yaobang (Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League) expressed his views on the work of the Youth League, the ideological education of young people, and vocational studies in his speech.

	Representatives from the fraternal parties of Algeria, Mexico, Denmark, Paraguay, Ecuador, Bolivia, Uruguay, and Iceland successively delivered speeches or read congratulatory letters at the congress. When they stepped onto the podium to deliver their speeches or finish reading their congratulatory letters, all the representatives stood up, and the warm applause lasted for a long time.

	Comrade Bouhali said in his speech that the Algerian people's guerrilla activities against the French colonial army have never been as frequent and lethal as in the past three months. This is because the National Liberation Army has been greatly strengthened in combat, and almost all the Algerian people are supporting this army in various forms. When Comrade Bouhali said that regardless of the French government's attitude, the Algerian people have no doubt about the victory of their just cause, thunderous applause erupted from the audience.

	Comrade Terrazas said in his speech that, like the people of all Latin American countries, the Mexican people will not succumb to imperialist conspiracies. Their struggle for national independence and liberation has begun, and this struggle is growing and developing day by day.

	Comrade Terrazas said in a loud and firm voice, "Nothing can stop this historical progress, and the struggle for national independence and liberation is bound to be victorious, just as the great Chinese revolution has already achieved victory." At this moment, warm applause rang out throughout the hall.

	Comrade Martin Nielsen said that the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people are one of the most decisive forces in the struggle for peace, democracy, and socialism in modern history, and the audience responded with warm applause. Comrade Nielsen said that delegations representing all strata of Danish society have visited China over the years, and they returned to Denmark with praise for the ancient culture of the Chinese people and their efforts to build a socialist future.

	All the representatives applauded warmly to praise the Paraguayan Communist Party representative for expressing the Paraguayan people's strong will to fight for freedom and liberation in reading the congratulatory message from the Central Committee of the Paraguayan Communist Party. The congratulatory message said that the experience of the Chinese revolution has shown the Paraguayan people that they can also liberate themselves from the shackles of US imperialism, from the anti-national dictatorship of the landlords, big speculators, and their ruling tool Stroessner; and will certainly become a free and sovereign independent country like the great People's Republic of China.

	Comrade Saad-Nyaim used the internal situation in Ecuador in his speech to confirm that the example of the victory of the Chinese revolution has great significance for the people of Ecuador and other Latin American countries. When he said that the revolutionary struggle of the Ecuadorian people will surely destroy the shackles that oppress them, the audience applauded warmly.

	The congratulatory letter from the Central Committee of the Bolivian Communist Party, read by the Bolivian Communist Party representative, said that the Chinese revolution has opened up new paths for the national liberation struggle and once again confirmed that colonial countries and dependent countries are capable of defeating foreign aggressors and feudal reactionaries. In Bolivia, we are fighting to break the isolation imposed on us by American monopoly capital and to establish trade and cultural exchanges with countries around the world. His remarks were warmly applauded by the representatives.

	Comrade Suarez said that the workers and people of Uruguay attach great importance to China's contribution to the cause of peace and friendship among the people of all countries. Recently, the Uruguayan people warmly welcomed the outstanding artists of the Chinese Art Troupe. Our trade unions and people from all walks of life are working hard to ensure that the proposal of the President of the People's Bank of China to the Bank of the Republic of Uruguay to conclude an exchange agreement between the two countries is adopted. He said that this is how the workers and people of Uruguay express their desire to strengthen the friendly relations between the people of China and Uruguay. All the representatives responded with warm applause.

	The speech by Comrade Gedmensen from Iceland, far away and close to the Arctic Circle, was warmly applauded by all the representatives. Comrade Gedmensen said that the quickest way for Iceland and China to make contact may be cultural exchange. They hope that Iceland and China will have increasingly frequent friendly exchanges in the future. After Comrade Gedmensen's speech, he presented a gift to the congress on behalf of the Icelandic Socialist Unity Party amidst warm applause.

	Executive Chairman Lai Ruoyu read the congratulatory telegrams from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Venezuela, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Luxembourg, and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Trieste. These fraternal parties expressed their concern for the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China and their friendship with the Chinese people. When these congratulatory telegrams were read, all the representatives expressed their welcome and gratitude with warm applause.

	Also speaking at the meeting today were: Jiang Hua (First Secretary of the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the CPC) and Jia Jun (Secretary of the Changzhi Prefectural Committee of the CPC in Shanxi Province).

	In his speech, Jiang Hua talked about the experiences and lessons of the Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee in leading the agricultural cooperativization movement, regarding committing right-leaning conservative errors and correcting errors. Jia Jun introduced the situation of transforming landlords and rich peasants in the old liberated area of Changzhi Prefecture, Shanxi Province.

	In their speeches today, seven representatives unanimously agreed with the three reports made by the Central Committee of the Party to the congress.
