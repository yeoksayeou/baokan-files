    Repeated Changes in Leadership Intentions Lead to Repeated Changes in Design Plans
    A Large Amount of Labor in the Chemical Design Institute is Wasted
    Insufficient design capabilities, with design lagging behind construction, is an old problem. It stands to reason that design capabilities should be especially cherished. However, the design capabilities of our Ministry of Chemical Industry's Chemical Design Institute are being wasted on a large scale. It's not that there is overstaffing or a lack of work here, but rather that there are many tasks, and comrades are all very busy, but due to the frequent changes in plans, little progress is made. Many nights of hard work are wasted by the ever-changing orders to revise designs.
    Since its establishment in 1954, the Chemical Design Institute has gathered a considerable number of design talents. However, in the past two years, in addition to completing the design of some smaller projects, only one relatively large engineering design has been completed. The design of many projects has been abandoned halfway, either after a portion was completed or after a considerable amount of time had been spent. For example, the engineering design for a certain chemical plant in Jilin was initially planned to be large, then it was scaled down, and finally, it disappeared altogether, rendering the previous efforts futile. The design for a certain chemical plant in Taiyuan was similar. Due to the inconsistent and ever-changing ideas of the leadership, nothing was ultimately accomplished.
    The situation of the expansion project of the Changshou Chemical Plant in Sichuan is even more absurd.
    The expansion project of the Changshou Chemical Plant in Sichuan was investigated by a specialist from the Chemical Design Institute in October 1955. It was determined by the former Chemical Industry Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry and approved by the State Council. The original plan was to start construction in June 1956, complete the expansion task in 1957, and put it into production. Later, it was changed to start construction in September 1956, complete the expansion task in 1957, and put it into production. In order to deliver the drawings for this expansion project on schedule, the Chemical Design Institute, lacking manpower, specially transferred a group of cadres from the Changshou Chemical Plant to participate in the design work of this project. Starting in February of this year, after nearly three months of intense work, we finally lived up to the expectations of the country and completed the preliminary design tasks of this phase of the project before May, on schedule. However, just as we were rejoicing in our labor achievements—the design drawings were about to participate in the construction of the motherland—and as we were about to enter the second stage of work—the design of construction drawings—unexpected news came that, supposedly because "the factory site is located in the southwest mountainous area, transportation is inconvenient, and it is not suitable for expanding a large factory," the design work was stopped. The design staff's labor achievements were locked into the archives.
    Not long after, new leadership intentions came, instructing us to redesign according to a quarter of the size of the original plan. The task was assigned, and although the design staff felt uncomfortable that their labor had been wasted, they were not discouraged. We thought: How can there be no shortcomings in work? The leadership always sees further, and changing the plan must have been carefully considered. In order to make up for the time lost due to the design changes, and in order to catch up with the construction requirements, we intensified the design work.
    Unexpectedly, when this design task was about to be completed, we suddenly received an instruction: "Various parties have different opinions on the expansion of the Changshou Chemical Plant, and the output cannot be determined." The design work was stopped again.
    A month later, we received the project task book for the third time. This time, the requirement was: design according to seven and three-quarters of the size of the second plan. Thus, the design work for the expansion project of the Changshou Chemical Plant began for the third time. After working non-stop for more than twenty days, we suddenly received a notice: "In order to speed up the design progress, the design work for the expansion project of the Changshou Chemical Plant will be handled by the factory itself according to technical measures." This time, the expansion scale was changed to one-tenth of the original plan. The expansion plan changed again, and our labor was, of course, wasted again.
    The extent of the loss caused by the "changes" in this expansion project is currently impossible to estimate. The design of the alkali-making section alone wasted more than seven hundred workdays. As for the waste and losses caused by the engineering company's idling, the ordering of equipment and steel according to the first design, etc., it is even more difficult to calculate.
    Changes in design tasks are, of course, often due to objective reasons. However, if things were considered more carefully in advance, how could there be "morning orders, evening changes"?
    We firmly oppose this work style of acting rashly and arbitrarily wasting design capabilities. We hope that the relevant leadership departments will quickly check these shortcomings and take practical and effective measures to prevent similar incidents from happening again.　Lù Défāng　Zhāng Guìhuá

### 领导意图反复无常，设计计划一变再变  化工设计院大量劳动尽付东流

    领导意图反复无常，设计计划一变再变
    化工设计院大量劳动尽付东流
    设计力量不足，设计赶不上施工，是老问题了。按说，设计力量应该特别被珍惜，然而，我们化学工业部化工设计院的设计力量却被大量地浪费着。倒不是这里人浮于事，没有活儿干，而是事情很多，同志们都很忙，但是由于方案多变，很少忙出什么名堂来。许多昼夜的辛勤劳动，都被反复无常的变更设计的命令白白浪费掉了。
    化工设计院从1954年成立以后，集中了不少的设计人才。但是两年多来，我们除完成了一些较小工程的设计以外，比较大的工程设计只完成了一项。有很多工程的设计都是做了一部分，或做了相当长时间以后，就半途而废了。例如吉林某化工厂的工程设计，先是计划很大，后来由大改小，最后竟由小变无，于是前功尽弃。给太原某化工厂作的设计也是如此。由于领导人员的主张不一，变化多端，最后是一无所成。
    四川长寿化工厂扩建工程的情况，更叫人啼笑皆非。
    四川长寿化工厂的扩建工程，是1955年10月份由化工设计院派专人到长寿调查过，经前重工业部化学工业管理局确定，并报请国务院批准的。原计划是1956年6月份施工，1957年完成扩建任务，投入生产。后来改为1956年9月份施工，1957年完成扩建任务，投入生产。为了按期交出这项扩建工程的图纸，化工设计院人力不足，还特地从长寿化工厂调来一批干部，参加了这个工程的设计工作。从今年2月份起开始设计，经过近三个月的紧张劳动，总算没辜负国家的企望，在5月份以前，按期完成了这期工程的初步设计任务。可是，当我们正在庆幸自己的劳动成果——设计图纸将要参加到祖国建设事业中去的时候，当我们就要进入第二阶段工作——施工图纸设计的时候，却传出一个出人意料的消息，据说是因为“厂址处于西南山区，运输不便，不宜扩建大厂”，便让设计工作停止进行。设计人员的劳动成果，就锁入了档案柜。
    事隔不久，来了新的领导意图，让按第一次计划规模的四分之一，重新设计。任务下来了，设计人员虽然曾为自己的劳动白白浪费掉感到不舒服，但还没有泄气。我们想：工作中怎么能没有缺点呢？领导上总是看得远，变更方案一定是慎重考虑过的。我们为了弥补由于变动设计在时间上造成的损失，为了赶上施工要求，就加紧进行设计工作。
    不料，当这一次的设计任务快要完成的时候，忽然又接到一道指示：“各方面对长寿化工厂的扩建意见不一致，产量无法肯定。”设计工作便又一次停止了。
    隔了一个月，我们第三次接到了这项工程的计划任务书。这次的要求是：按照第二次计划规模的八分之七点七五设计。于是长寿化工厂扩建工程的设计工作，又第三次开始了。一连忙了二十多天，忽然又接到一个通知：“为了赶设计进度，把长寿化工厂扩建工程的设计工作，按技术措施，交由厂里自己处理。”这一次的变动，扩建规模已改为第一次计划的十分之一。扩建计划又变了，我们的劳动当然又白费了。
    这项扩建工程的“变化”，究竟造成多大损失，暂且无法估计。仅制碱科的设计，就浪费了七百多个工作日。至于工程公司窝工，设备、钢材已按第一次设计订货等等所造成的浪费、损失，那就更难计算了。
    设计任务的变更，当然常常有客观原因。但是，如果事先考虑周密一点，又何至于“朝令夕改”呢？
    我们坚决反对这种草率从事、任意糟蹋设计力量的工作作风。希望有关领导部门迅速检查这些缺点，并且采取切实有效的措施，防止类似事情继续发生。　陆德芳　张桂华
