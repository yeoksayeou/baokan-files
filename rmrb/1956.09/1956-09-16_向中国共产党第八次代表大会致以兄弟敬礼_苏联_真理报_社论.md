    Brotherly Greetings to the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China
    Soviet "Pravda" Editorial

    The Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China opens in Beijing today. The convening of the Congress is a major event for the Communist Party of China and the entire Chinese people. At the same time, the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China is also of great significance to the international communist and workers' movement.

    The Communist Party of China, born thirty-five years ago, has gone through a glorious and heroic path. The Communist Party of China has grown from a small group of Marxist believers inspired by the ideas of the Great October Revolution into a strong team of over ten million members that steadfastly leads its people toward socialism.

    The Communist Party of China experienced many difficulties before leading the people to achieve great victories. However, these difficulties did not discourage the Communists. They tenaciously and persistently organized the national liberation struggle. In this struggle, they attracted all patriotic and democratic forces to their side and united these forces into a united front under the banner of anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolution. The Communist Party of China achieved a great victory over the reactionary forces and ended the national liberation struggle with the proclamation of the People's Republic of China. The victory of the Chinese revolution dealt a devastating blow to the imperialist system in half the world. This historically significant victory injected new strength into the ranks of the peace, democracy, and socialism camp and changed the balance of power on the international stage in favor of the socialist camp countries.

    The Communist Party of China is convening this congress for the first time since the national liberation. The period between the Seventh and Eighth National Congresses of the Communist Party of China is a period full of significant historical changes and a whole era full of great achievements. Eleven years ago, the Seventh Party Congress was held in the small city of Yan'an, when Japanese occupiers were trampling on Chinese soil, and the country was shrouded in Kuomintang terror. China did not have a developed industry, and agriculture was in a state of disrepair. Urban and rural workers suffered from hunger and poverty.

    The Eighth National Congress is being convened in a completely different environment. The rule of feudalism, imperialism, and bureaucratic capital has been eliminated in the country. On the ruins of the old society, a people's democratic state led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance has been established. The people's democratic dictatorship is effectively performing the functions of the proletarian dictatorship. The Chinese people are advancing confidently and resolutely along the road to socialism.

    The Chinese people have made tremendous achievements in the country's socialist industrialization. Inspired by the idea of socialist construction, the Chinese working people are working with unprecedented enthusiasm, striving to complete the first five-year plan for the development of the national economy ahead of schedule.

    The Communist Party of China has achieved brilliant victories in the socialist transformation of agriculture. The plan formulated by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to transfer the peasant masses to collective labor has been basically completed. This plan creatively applies Lenin's ideas on agricultural collectivization, taking into account the characteristics of the Chinese countryside. The vast majority of Chinese peasants have now joined various types of cooperatives and are building a new life.

    The people's regime is gradually transforming private capitalist enterprises into socialist enterprises. China is able to eliminate capitalist exploitation by peaceful means because the state power led by the working class is consolidated, the socialist economy is constantly developing, the people's democratic united front based on the worker-peasant alliance with the participation of the national bourgeoisie is strengthened, and also because there are favorable factors such as the existence of a strong international socialist camp.

    The People's Republic of China is a powerful factor in consolidating world peace. Together with the peace-loving people of all countries, it is unyieldingly and consistently striving to ease international tensions and peacefully resolve all international issues.

    There are still many difficulties on the road of socialist builders in China, but their difficulties have been reduced because the glorious Communist Party of China has accumulated experience in economic and cultural construction, and there is rich experience in building socialism from the Soviet Union and other socialist countries.

    The Communist Party of China is loyal to the ideas of proletarian internationalism, and it has firmly formed a fraternal friendship and comradely cooperation with the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, with the communist and workers' parties of all countries in the world. Common goals and common ideals make the Communists of China closely connected with the Communists of the Soviet Union and other countries. The attempts of imperialists to alienate the relations between the brother parties and create disputes between them are so pathetic and futile, like an ant trying to shake a big tree.

    The Communist Party of China has been and is loyal to the great and invincible banner of Marxism-Leninism. Throughout its entire path, the Communist Party of China has always defended the purity of Marxist-Leninist thought, resolutely opposed dogmatism, subjectivism, and formalism, and resolutely creatively studied revolutionary theory in accordance with China's specific conditions.

    At the time of the convening of the Eighth National Congress, the Communist Party of China is united, and the whole party is united around the Central Committee of the Party. The enemies of the Party have repeatedly attempted to undermine the unity of the Party's ranks, and this attempt has been completely shattered. The Party's iron unity has been further consolidated. The Chinese Communists have united their ranks more closely around the fighting Central Committee.

    The strength of the Chinese Communists lies in their close ties with the masses of the people, who have unlimited trust in their party. The Party constantly teaches its members to care about the needs and interests of the masses, not to be divorced from the masses, and to deeply study and summarize the experience of the workers and peasants. "From the masses, to the masses," the Party's line has proven to be completely correct at all stages of the struggle for national liberation and the construction of socialism. The Party constantly strengthens its ties with the masses. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "We Communists, no matter what issue we are dealing with, must be able to combine with the masses. If our party members sit in their houses all their lives without going out, without experiencing wind and rain, without seeing the world, what good are these party members to the Chinese people? There is no good at all. We don't need such people as party members. We Communists should experience wind and rain and see the world; this wind and rain is the great wind and rain of mass struggle, and this world is the great world of mass struggle."

    The Communist Party of China believes that strengthening the people's democratic united front is of particular importance and regards it as a positive factor in building socialism. Taking full account of its own characteristics, the Communist Party of China strives to give fuller play to the initiative of all people participating in the united front and to use their creative power, and therefore proposes the policy of long-term coexistence, mutual assistance, mutual supervision, and mutual criticism between the Communist Party and the democratic parties.

    The Party's Eighth National Congress is being held under the circumstances of unprecedentedly high political enthusiasm and labor enthusiasm of the Chinese people. The Chinese people regard the Communist Party as their recognized leader and guide.

    The Eighth National Congress of the CPC is a congress of victors who have overcome reactionary forces and a congress of builders of a new socialist society.

    The Congress will summarize the Party's effective work since the Seventh National Congress and will comprehensively discuss some extremely important issues in the country's socialist construction.

    Very grand prospects are unfolding before the people of China. There is no doubt that the great Chinese people, who have mastered their own destiny, will victoriously complete the historical tasks facing them under the leadership of the long-tested Communist Party. To realize these historical tasks, great efforts must be made, and many difficulties must be overcome, and the resistance of imperialist reactionary groups and all kinds of enemies who oppose socialist construction must be crushed.

    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 15th: The Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the entire Soviet people warmly welcome the opening of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China and wish the participants of the Congress a victorious and fruitful work for the Chinese people, for the entire international communist movement and workers' movement, and for the consolidation of world peace.

    向中国共产党第八次代表大会致以兄弟敬礼
    苏联“真理报”社论
    中国共产党第八次代表大会今天在北京开幕了。代表大会的召开是中国共产党和全体中国人民的一件大事。同时，中国共产党第八次代表大会对国际共产主义运动和工人运动也有巨大的意义。
    三十五年前诞生的中国共产党已经经历了一段光荣的英雄的道路。中国共产党从一个受伟大十月革命思想所鼓舞的人数不多的马克思主义信仰者小组而壮大成为一支坚定不移地领导本国人民走向社会主义有一千多万党员的强大队伍。
    中国共产党在领导人民取得伟大胜利以前，曾经经历了许许多多困难。但是，这些困难并没有使中国共产党人丧失勇气。他们顽强地、坚持不懈地组织民族解放斗争。在这一斗争中，他们把全国一切爱国力量和民主力量吸引到自己一边，并且在反帝反封建的革命旗帜下把这些力量团结成一个统一战线。中国共产党取得了对反动势力的巨大胜利，并且以中华人民共和国的宣告成立结束了民族解放斗争。中国革命的胜利给半个世界的帝国主义体系以毁灭性的打击。这个具有历史意义的胜利给和平、民主和社会主义阵营的队伍注入了新的力量，使国际舞台上的力量对比改变得有利于社会主义阵营国家。
    中国共产党在全国解放后第一次召开这次代表大会。中国共产党第七次代表大会和第八次代表大会之间的这一段时期是一个充满重大历史变化的时期，是一个充满伟大成就的整个时代。十一年前在不大的城市延安召开了党第七次代表大会，那时日本占领者践踏着中国的土地，国内笼罩着国民党的恐怖。中国没有发达的工业，农业处于荒废状态。城乡劳动者遭受着饥饿和贫困。
    第八次代表大会是在完全不同的环境中召开的。封建主义、帝国主义和官僚资本的势力在国内的统治已经被消灭。在旧社会的废墟上建立了一个由工人阶级领导的、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主国家。人民民主专政在有效地执行无产阶级专政的职能。中国人民满怀信心地和坚决地沿着走向社会主义的道路前进。
    中国人民在国家的社会主义工业化方面取得了巨大的成就。为社会主义建设的思想所鼓舞着的中国劳动人民以空前未有的热情工作着，争取提前完成发展国民经济的第一个五年计划。
    中国共产党在农业的社会主义改造中取得了辉煌的胜利。中国共产党中央委员会所制订的关于使农民群众转到集体劳动的计划基本上已经完成，这一计划创造性地运用了列宁的关于农业集体化的思想，考虑到了中国农村的特点。绝大多数的中国农民群众现在都已经加入各种类型的合作社，在建设新的生活。
    人民政权在逐渐把私人资本主义企业改造为社会主义企业。中国之所以能够使用和平方法消灭资本主义剥削，是因为工人阶级领导的国家政权得到巩固，社会主义经济不断发展，以工农联盟为基础的、有民族资产阶级参加的人民民主统一战线获得加强，还因为具备有像存在强大的国际社会主义阵营的这种有利的因素。
    中华人民共和国是巩固世界和平的有力因素。它同各国爱好和平的人民一起，不屈不挠地、始终不渝地争取缓和国际紧张局势，争取和平解决一切国际问题。
    在中国社会主义建设者的道路上还有不少困难，但是由于光荣的中国共产党在经济和文化建设上已经积累了经验，并且有苏联和其他社会主义国家建设社会主义的丰富经验，他们的困难也就减轻了。
    中国共产党忠于无产阶级国际主义的思想，同苏联共产党、同世界各国的共产党和工人党巩固地结成了兄弟友谊和同志式的合作，一致的目标和共同的理想使中国共产党人同苏联和其他国家的共产党人亲密无间。帝国主义者企图离间兄弟党之间的关系和在它们之间制造纠纷的企图是这样的可怜和徒劳无益，不过像蚍蜉撼大树而已。
    中国共产党过去和现在都是忠实于马克思列宁主义的伟大的战无不胜的旗帜，中国共产党在自己所经历的整个道路上，始终不渝地捍卫着马克思列宁主义的思想的纯洁性，坚决反对教条主义、主观主义和形式主义，坚决地按照中国的具体情况创造性地研究革命的理论。
    在召开第八次代表大会的时候，中国共产党是团结一致的，全党都团结在党中央委员会的周围。党的敌人屡次企图破坏党的队伍的团结，这种企图已经被彻底粉碎。党的钢铁般的团结更加巩固了。中国共产党人把自己的队伍更加紧密地团结在战斗的中央委员会的周围。
    中国共产党人的力量在于他们同人民大众保持着紧密的联系，人民大众对自己的党怀着无限的信任。党经常教导党员要关心群众的需要和利益，不要脱离群众，深刻地研究和总结工农大众的经验。“从群众中来，到群众中去”，党的这个路线在争取民族解放和建设社会主义的斗争的一切阶段中都被证明是完全正确的。党不断地加强自己同群众的联系，毛泽东同志说：“我们共产党员，无论在什么问题上，一定要能够同群众相结合。如果我们的党员，一生一世坐在房子里不出去，不经风雨，不见世面，这种党员，对于中国人民究竟有什么好处没有呢？一点好处也没有的，我们不需要这样的人做党员。我们共产党员应该经风雨，见世面；这个风雨，就是群众斗争的大风雨，这个世面，就是群众斗争的大世面。”
    中国共产党认为，加强人民民主统一战线有特别重要的意义，把它看成是建设社会主义的积极因素。中国共产党充分考虑到本国的特点，力求更加充分发挥参加统一 战线的一切人士的主动性和利用他们的创造力量，因而提出了共产党同各民主党派长期共存、互相帮助、互相监督、互相批评的方针。
    党第八次代表大会是在中国人民群众的政治热情和劳动热情空前高涨的情况下举行的。中国人民群众把共产党看成是自己的公认的领袖和指导者。
    中共第八次代表大会是战胜反动势力的胜利者的代表大会，是社会主义新社会的建设者的代表大会。
    代表大会将对第七次代表大会以来的党的卓有成效的工作进行总结，将对国家的社会主义建设中的一些极重要的问题进行全面的讨论。
    在人民中国的面前展开了十分宏伟的远景。毫无疑问，掌握了自己命运的伟大中国人民，在久经锻炼的共产党的领导下，一定会胜利地完成他们面临的历史任务。要实现这些历史任务，就要作极大的努力，要克服不少的困难和粉碎帝国主义反动集团以及一切形形色色的反对社会主义建设的敌人的反抗。
    苏联共产党和全体苏联人民热烈欢迎中国共产党第八次代表大会的开幕，并祝大会参加者为中国人民、为整个国际共产主义运动和工人运动、为巩固世界和平进行胜利的卓有成效的工作。（新华社据塔斯社莫斯科15日电）
