    Annoying Difficulties
    By Our Correspondent Liu Heng
    
    (I)
    
    The workers of the Third Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways encountered many difficulties after moving from the Ji-Er Line to Baotou to build the railway.
    
    When discussing some of these difficulties, the workers would become excited, their eyebrows dancing, as if they were talking about thrilling and interesting stories:
    
     “That night was so dangerous! There was no moon in the sky, not a single star, it was pitch black everywhere, couldn't see a thing. Suddenly, a flash flood erupted! People ran with flashlights, shouting as they went, all crowding to the side of the riverbank. This was a newly built riverbank, how could it withstand such fierce waves! We could only hear 'plop' 'plop' sounds, large chunks of the bank falling into the river, and it looked as if the riverbank was about to collapse. At that critical moment, the crowd surged forward with a 'whoosh'. Everyone cut down willow trees, carried stones, filled baskets with mud, and used raincoats to wrap sand, blocking the waves. There were about a hundred of us, just these hundred people, forming a long line along the bank, standing as a thick human wall, afraid of your river acting fierce? In the end, the river was indeed obediently tamed."
    
    However, when discussing other difficulties, the workers' faces would immediately change. The more they talked, the angrier they became, the more annoyed, their hearts almost burning.
    
    Among these annoying difficulties, one was building temporary sheds.
    
    Originally, the workers of the Third Engineering Bureau built railways and never had a fixed place to live. They moved wherever the railway was being built. If they wanted to live somewhere, they had to build a house. Building a solid and sturdy one was not easy to do quickly. At the same time, the workers would only live there for a year and a half, or three to five months, and then they would leave, which was not economically sound. Therefore, everyone would get some mud and grass and build many thatched sheds, just to make do temporarily. When it was time to move, they would dismantle the beams, purlins, mats, nails, and wood from the temporary sheds, and then load them onto vehicles and transport them away.
    
    In January of this year, it was cold weather. When the workers arrived in Baotou, they unloaded the beams, purlins, mats, nails, and wood from the trains one by one, and then transported them to the construction site by trucks, ox carts, horse carts, and so on.
    
    The railway had to pass through several sandy areas, and many temporary sheds had to be built on top of these sandy areas. Mud plaster wouldn't stick to the sand, but there was no mud nearby, and they had to travel three or five miles to find it. When they finally found it, they would dig with a hoe, only to hear "clang clang clang" sounds, and not see any mud move, because the mud was frozen as hard as iron! Everyone would then bring over a lot of firewood and burn it on the ground, thawing the frozen soil before transporting it to the construction site.
    
    At the construction site, several large piles of fire were also burning, and boiling water was used to mix the mud. The steaming mud would freeze as soon as it was put on the roof. Could they make a fire on the sheds? No! So, they couldn't build sheds? No! Everyone had to just make do and build many sheds in a makeshift manner.
    
    When spring arrived, the thaw came, and the sheds dripped and leaked, water and mud everywhere.
    
    Usually, whenever there was thunder and lightning, the workers' minds would immediately fly away from their work. When it was windy and rainy, the temporary sheds would shake and move around, raining outside and muddy inside. At night, the workers would hold their quilts and run around to hide. Some hid under desks to sleep, others camped outside with umbrellas. The section chiefs and site directors were so scared that they ran around in the rain all night, afraid to go home to sleep. Because if a shed collapsed and killed or injured someone, they would be responsible! On the Ji-Er Line, there had been a bloody lesson: once, a shed collapsed, killing three people, and four responsible cadres were punished with demotion, warnings, and demerits.
    
    (II)
    
    One day, I went to the Second Engineering Section of the Third Engineering Bureau to find Section Chief Ding Wanchen. As if he had taken some bitter medicine, as soon as Section Chief Ding heard me mention the temporary sheds, his smiling face immediately turned into a look of indignation.
    
    I asked him, "Building temporary sheds is so difficult, why don't you think of a better way?"
    
    He said, "Actually, a better way has been around for a long time! This better way was not thought up by us, but by the herders. The herders, based on thousands of years of experience, know that it is good to live in yurts. We railway builders are also constantly moving around, why can't we live in yurts or tents?"
    
     "Then why didn't you bring this up?"
    
     "Who said I didn't bring it up? Which meeting haven't I brought it up at? I've brought it up so many times that I don't even want to open my mouth anymore! I've brought it up all the way to the Ministry of Railways! The Ministry of Railways said: Tents - especially cotton tents and felt tents - are too expensive to invest in, there isn't that much money."
    
     "Indeed, that needs to be calculated."
    
     "We calculated this a long time ago! Roughly calculated, cotton tents are many times more expensive than temporary sheds, the investment is indeed too large. However, calculations must be detailed, right? Calculations cannot only be for the present, they must be for the long term! Calculations cannot only be for one type of account, they must be for all kinds of accounts! For example, we are always moving, so we must carefully calculate the cost of moving! When moving, a large truck can carry four tents. But, one temporary shed? It takes three trucks to carry it! Besides trucks, there are also trains, ox carts, horse carts, etc., shouldn't this transportation cost be calculated? Also, tents have very few parts, and the parts are right on the tent, so they are not easily lost. But, what about the small nails and small pieces of wood on the temporary sheds? Countless! They are either lost or broken during the move, and this loss rate is even clearly stipulated by the higher authorities as reasonable and unavoidable. Also, moving causes delays in work, doesn't it? Dismantling sheds, transporting sheds, building sheds, how much work is lost? Just building a shed takes one workday per square meter! After the shed is built, you have to constantly plaster mud on it, and you have to plaster mud every time it rains. Not to mention the workers worrying and being unable to concentrate on their work, the work lost just from plastering mud is simply incalculable! If we had tents, wouldn't all this work be completely used for building railways? Shouldn't the benefits this brings to the country also be calculated?"
    
     "Tents are certainly good, maybe the country can't come up with that much money right now?"
    
     "That's what I think too! But I said, it doesn't matter if the country can't come up with that much money right now! We can make a long-term plan to gradually change our temporary sheds into tents. However, after this suggestion was made, no one even paid attention to it! They didn't say it was good, and they didn't say it was bad. In reality, not saying anything is just rejecting the suggestion, isn't it?"
    
     "I think the leadership will not fail to pay attention to this suggestion. Let us write an article in the People's Daily to appeal."
    
    Section Chief Ding agreed with my suggestion, so the above article was written. I think: our workers are people who are not afraid of difficulties and are brave in overcoming them. However, when they encounter some difficulties that they cannot overcome themselves and need the leadership to solve, but the leadership does not provide a solution, these difficulties become terrible and annoying! We should not allow these terrible and annoying difficulties to continue to exist.

    令人恼火的困难
    本报记者　刘衡
    （一）
    铁道部第三工程局的职工们，从集二线搬到包头来修铁路之后，碰到了许多许多困难。
    对有些困难，职工们谈起来，一个个兴高采烈，眉飞色舞，就像在谈什么惊险有趣的故事：
     “那天夜里好险哪！天上没有月亮，也没有一颗星，到处黑漆漆一团，找不到个缝。突然，山洪暴发了！人们打着手电，一边跑，一边喊，一齐拥到河堤旁边。这是刚砌的河堤呀，怎么抗得住这么凶猛的波浪呀！只听见‘扑通’‘扑通’响，堤身一大片一大片往河里掉，眼看着河堤要决口了。就在这紧急关头，人群‘呼啦’一下拥过来了。大伙儿砍倒柳树，搬来石头，用篮子装满泥巴，用雨衣包着砂子，挡住浪头。咱们有一百来人哪，光这一百来人，在堤边摆起长蛇阵，就站成一道厚厚的人墙，还怕你河水逞凶吗？到后来，河水果然乖乖地给治服了。”
    可是，对有些困难，职工们一提起来，脸色立刻就变了。越谈越气大，越谈越恼火，心都要烧起来了。
    在这些令人恼火的困难中，有一个是盖临时工棚。
    原来第三工程局的职工们是修铁路的，从来没有个一定的住处。铁路修到哪里，他们就搬到哪里去住。要住就要盖房子。盖个坚固结实点的吧，一时不容易盖起来。同时，职工们住个一年半载，三月五月，就要走啦，在经济上很不合算。因此，大家弄些泥巴、草，盖许多茅棚子，临时凑合凑合。等到搬家的时候，把临时工棚上的梁呀，檩呀，席呀，钉子、木料呀，一个个拆下来，再一个个装车运走。
    今年1月，正是冷天。职工们来到包头，就把运来的那些梁呀，檩呀，席呀，钉子、木料呀，一个一个从火车上搬下来，又用汽车、牛车、马车等等运到工地上去。
    铁路要通过好几段沙窝子，许多临时工棚就得盖在沙窝子上面。用沙子抹房抹不住，可是，周围又没有泥巴，要跑出三里、五里路去找。好容易找到了，用镢头一挖，只听见“噹噹噹”响，看不见泥巴动弹，原来泥巴已经冻得跟铁一样硬了！大伙儿就抱来好些柴禾，放在地上烧。把冻土烤化后，再往工地上运。
    工地上，也是烧着几大堆火，用烧开的水和泥巴。冒着热气的泥巴，一拿到房顶上，立刻冻得抹不开了。你能在工棚上烧火吗？不能！那就不盖工棚了吧？不行！大伙儿只好凑凑合合，马马虎虎的盖上许多间。
    春天到了，解冻了，工棚里稀里哗啦，下开了雨，滴的到处是水，是泥。
    平常，一有个打雷闪，职工们干活的心立刻就飞了。碰到刮风下雨天，临时工棚就乱晃乱动，棚外下雨，棚里下泥。夜里，职工们抱着被子到处乱躲。有的躲在办公桌子底下睡觉，有的打着雨伞就在外边露营。那些段长们、工地主任们吓得连夜在雨地里到处跑，到处看，不敢回家睡觉。因为要是工棚垮下来，砸死砸伤了人，这个责任可负不起！在集二线上，就有过血的教训：有次，有座工棚垮了，砸死了三个人，有四个负责干部受到了撤职、警告、记过等处分。（二）
    有一天，我到第三工程局第二工程段去找段长丁万臣。就像吃了什么苦药一样，丁段长一听见我提起临时工棚，带笑的脸立刻不笑了，变成愤愤不平的样儿。
    我问他：“盖临时工棚的困难这样大，你们为什么不想个别的好法子？”
    他说：“其实，别的好法子早就有了！这个好法子不是我们自己想出来的，是人家牧民们想出来的。人家牧民根据几千几百年来的经验，都知道住蒙古包好。咱们修铁路的人也是到处流动，为什么不可以住住蒙古包，或者是帐篷？”
     “那你为什么不把这个意见提上去？”
     “谁说我没有提上去？我哪次会上没提？提得我都不想再张嘴啦！我早就提上去了，一直提到铁道部啦！铁道部说：帐篷——特别是棉帐篷、毡帐篷的投资太大了，没有这么多钱。”
     “的确，这个账也得算一算。”
     “这个账咱们早就算过啦！粗粗一算，棉帐篷比临时工棚要贵好些倍，投资的确太大了。可是，算账得算细账，是不是？算账不能光算眼前，要算得更长远！算账不能光算一种账，要算各种各样的账！比方，咱们老是搬来搬去，就得好好算算这个搬家的账！搬起家来，一辆大卡车可以装四个帐篷。可是，一座临时工棚呢？得用三辆汽车来装！除掉汽车，还有火车、牛车、马车等等，这个运费该算不该算？还有，帐篷上的零件很少，而且零件就在帐篷上面，不容易丢失。可是，临时工棚上的小钉子、小木头呢？数都数不清！不是搬丢了，就是搬断了，这个损耗率呀，连上级都有明文规定，认为是合理合法，少不了的。还有，搬家得误工是不是？拆工棚，运工棚，盖工棚，得误多少工呀？光盖工棚，一平方公尺就要花一个工！盖起工棚之后，还要不住地在上边抹泥，下一场雨就得抹一次泥。不说职工们担心受怕、无法安心工作啦，光这个抹泥的工误得简直就没法算！要是有了帐篷，这些工不就完全可以用到修铁路上去了吗？这给国家带来的好处，不也应该算一算账吗？”
     “帐篷固然是好，也许是国家一时拿不出这么多钱来吧？”
     “我也是这样想呀！但是我说，国家一时拿不出这么些钱来，不要紧！可以订个长远规划，慢慢把我们住的临时工棚改成帐篷。可是，这个意见提上去后，人家连理也没有理！不说好，也不说不好。实际上，不做声，不就是把意见给顶回来了吗？”
     “我想，这个意见，领导部门是不会不重视的。让我们写个稿子在人民日报上呼吁呼吁。”
    丁段长同意了我的意见，于是就写成了上面这篇稿子。我想：我们的职工都是一些不怕困难、勇于克服困难的人。可是，当他们碰到一些自己无法克服、需要领导来解决的困难，而领导并不给予解决的时候，这种困难就变成可怕的，而且恼火的了！我们不应该让这些可怕的令人恼火的困难继续存在下去。
