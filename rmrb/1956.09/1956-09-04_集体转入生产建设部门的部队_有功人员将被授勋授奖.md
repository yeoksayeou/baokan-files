Troops Collectively Transferred to Production and Construction Departments;
    Meritorious Personnel to be Awarded Medals and Prizes
    (From Our Newspaper) The Organization Department of the CPC Central Committee, the State Council Personnel Bureau, the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and the General Cadre Department jointly convened a meeting from August 27th to 31st regarding the awarding of medals and prizes to troops collectively transferred to production and construction departments in the past few years. Representatives from various divisions of the troops collectively transferred to production and construction departments attended the meeting. Gan Weihan, Deputy Director of the General Cadre Department, pointed out in his speech: The main purpose of this meeting is to study and discuss how to better carry out the work of awarding medals and prizes to troops collectively transferred to production and construction, so that those serving in production and construction posts who have made meritorious contributions in past revolutionary wars can receive the honor given by the people, just like those still serving in the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and use this to encourage them to carry forward their glory in their respective posts and contribute even more to the socialist construction of the motherland. Wang Dikang, Deputy Director of the Military Rank and Award Department of the General Cadre Department, explained the steps to be taken in carrying out this work. Afterwards, representatives of the troops collectively transferred to production and construction, based on the above reports and explanations and combined with the specific circumstances of their respective units, conducted group discussions. The meeting finally determined that this work will begin in the second half of this year and end in the first half of next year. At the same time, after the work of awarding medals and prizes has been basically completed in most of the troops collectively transferred to production and construction departments, this work will continue in batches among all demobilized and transferred military personnel in the past few years.
