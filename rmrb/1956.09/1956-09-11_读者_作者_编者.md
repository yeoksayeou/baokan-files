Readers, Authors, and Editors

    We are Studying This Editorial
    Guo Yongfu from the Fourth Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways writes: The editorial in the People's Daily on September 1st, entitled "Don't Be Reckless," has aroused great interest here. This editorial criticized the reckless work style in the construction of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway—blindly rushing to complete the work, resulting in frequent accidents and poor engineering quality. Our engineering bureau is responsible for the construction of the final section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway—the Baoji-Lueyang middle section (from Fengxian to Huangsha River). Now, the political department of the engineering bureau has notified all units to organize the study of this editorial and to check their own work in light of it.
    The letter believes that this editorial was published a bit late. If the newspaper had raised this issue two months earlier, the tendency of blindly rushing to complete the work that had already occurred in the construction could have been corrected in time, and many losses could have been avoided as a result.

    The Quality of Heavy Industrial Products Also Needs to Be Evaluated
    The People's Daily has been relatively concerned about the quality of light industrial products recently, frequently publishing evaluations of the quality of these products and readers' opinions. However, I believe that it is also necessary to evaluate the quality of some heavy industrial products. At present, the quality of many heavy industrial products is unsatisfactory. Through newspaper evaluations, we can also urge relevant factories to actively find ways to improve the quality of these products. Feng Wenbing

    Retailing Newspapers for Hospital Patients
    Patients hospitalized at Tiantan Hospital are very eager to read newspapers. Although the hospital subscribes to newspapers, it cannot meet the needs of the patients. There is a retail store here (Chongwen District Third Retail Store) with a sign at the door saying "This store retails newspapers," but it does not retail newspapers. I have asked them five times why they do not sell newspapers, and the answers I received were all different. Finally, they simply took down the "This store retails newspapers" sign.
    This retail store can completely subscribe to and retail newspapers for patients through the hospital's nurses, or it can relay this suggestion to the Tianqiao Post Office, allowing the post office to send a newspaper delivery worker to sell newspapers in the wards every day. I estimate that selling dozens of newspapers a day in this hospital would not be a problem. Li Qingfang

    Don't Write Headline Characters Too Cursively
    Recently, some headlines in newspapers and periodicals have used handwritten fonts, but some characters are written too cursively, making it difficult for readers to recognize them. For example, the character "Lan" in the headline "Settling Down at the Foot of Helan Mountain for a Year" on the third page of the People's Daily, and the characters "Wen" and "Zhan" in the headline "Old News and New Stories About Zhanjiang" on the second page, are all written too cursively. If I were to only look at the headlines, I would not be able to recognize these characters. I hope that the headline characters are not written too cursively, so as not to cause reading difficulties for readers.

    Welcome Articles That Combine Theory with Practice
    The article "The Dialectical Relationship Between Knowledge and Practice" (see page seven of this newspaper on August 17) is easy to understand, well-organized, and particularly helpful to readers because it is combined with China's actual situation. I suggest that newspapers publish more theoretical articles on philosophy and political economy.

    我们正在学习这篇社论
    铁道部第四工程局郭永福来信：9月1日人民日报的一篇题为“不要蛮干”的社论，在我们这里引起了很大兴趣。这篇社论批评了宝成铁路建设中的蛮干作风——盲目地突击赶工，以致事故累累工程质量低劣，而我们这个工程局正是担负宝成路最后一段工程——宝略中段（从凤县到黄沙河）的施工任务。现在，工程局政治部已经通知各单位组织学习这篇社论，并且联系检查自己的工作。
    来信认为：这篇社论发表得迟了一些，如果报纸能在两个月以前就提出这个问题，那末，施工中已经发生的盲目突击赶工的偏向，将可能及时地得到纠正，很多损失也因此可以避免。
    也需要评介重工业产品的质量
    人民日报最近对于轻工业产品质量是比较关心的，经常发表这些产品质量的评介以及读者的意见。但是，我认为对一些重工业产品质量的评介也是必要的。目前，许多重工业产品的质量不能令人满意，通过报纸的评介，也可以督促有关的工厂积极设法提高这些产品的质量。　封文炳
    为医院的病人零售报纸
    在天坛医院住院的病人，都很想看报。医院虽订有报纸，但不能满足病员的需要。这里有一个零售商店（崇文区第三零售店），门口挂着“本店零售报纸”的牌子，可是并不零售报纸。我曾五次问过他们为什么不卖报纸，得到的回答都不一样；最后，他们索性把“本店零售报纸”的牌子也摘下来了。
    这个零售商店完全可以通过医院的护士同志为病员订阅零售报纸，或者可以把这个意见转告天桥邮局，让邮局派一个送报工人每天到病房卖报。我估计，在这个医院里，一天销几十份报纸是没有问题的。　李庆方
    标题字不要写得太草
    近来，报刊上有些标题采用了笔写的字体，但是，有些字写得太草，使读者不易认识。比如人民日报第三版“贺兰山下安家一年”标题中的“兰”字，第二版“旧闻新事话湛江”标题中的“闻”字和“湛”字，都写得太草，要是叫我只看标题，是认不得这些字的。我希望标题字不要写得太草，以免给读者造成阅读的困难。

    欢迎这种理论结合实际的文章
    “认识和实践的辩证关系”一文（见八月十七日本报第七版），通俗易懂，条理分明，特别是结合了我国的实际情况，对读者帮助很大。我建议报纸多登载一些有关哲学和政治经济学的理论文章。
