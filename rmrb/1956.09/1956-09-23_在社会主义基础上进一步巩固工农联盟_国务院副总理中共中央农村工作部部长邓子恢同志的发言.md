I completely agree with the Central Committee's political report, the report on revising the Party Constitution, and the report on the proposals for the Second Five-Year Plan. I believe that the political and organizational lines of the Central Committee, headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, have been completely correct since the Seventh National Congress of the Party. These reports systematically and brilliantly summarize the experiences and lessons of our Party since the Seventh National Congress and correctly put forward the guidelines, tasks, and principles for building the country and building the Party in the future. I would now like to express some opinions on the peasant movement and the worker-peasant alliance.

**The Fundamental Guarantee for Building Socialism**

Old China was a semi-feudal, semi-colonial, backward agricultural country, and also a country with a vast territory and a large population. Peasants accounted for the vast majority of the national population, most of whom were poor peasants and semi-proletarians, possessing a high degree of revolutionary spirit and a history of armed struggle. Under these specific circumstances, the Chinese working class and the Communist Party had to rely on the peasants as the main force of the revolution in order to complete the revolutionary task. In socialist construction after the victory of the revolution, agriculture is the foundation of industrial development. In the process of realizing industrialization, 500 million peasants still occupy an extremely important position. This is the most fundamental characteristic of the Chinese revolution. Therefore, correctly understanding the great role of peasants and correctly handling the worker-peasant alliance is not only the fundamental guarantee for the success of the Chinese revolution, but also the fundamental guarantee for the victory of socialist construction in the future.

In the stage of democratic revolution, all "left" and right-leaning opportunists made mistakes on the peasant question. They did not understand the characteristics of the Chinese revolution, did not understand the great revolutionary role of Chinese peasants, and were unwilling to rely on the peasants or regard them as the main force of the revolution. This is the main common point of all "left" and right-leaning opportunist errors, and it is also their fundamental point of divergence from Marxists and Leninists on the issue of the worker-peasant alliance. Only the correct leadership represented by Comrade Mao Zedong truly recognized the characteristics of the Chinese revolution, recognized the great revolutionary role of peasants, determined the basic line of relying on peasants under the leadership of the Party to carry out the revolution, thereby correctly handling the worker-peasant alliance, and stipulated that the Chinese revolution should not take the path of urban workers' uprisings to seize power, but rely on peasants to first establish revolutionary base areas in the countryside, develop revolutionary armed forces, strengthen revolutionary forces, create a situation in which the countryside surrounds the cities, and then liberate the cities and liberate all of China. This correctly solved the specific path of development for the Chinese revolution. In particular, after the rectification study since 1942 and the Seventh National Congress of the Party, the mistakes of "left" and right-leaning opportunism were thoroughly criticized ideologically, and the ideological level of the vast number of Party members and cadres was improved. Therefore, after the Seventh National Congress, the revolutionary base areas more fully mobilized the peasant masses and accumulated huge revolutionary forces. This is the most fundamental factor why we were able to quickly win the victory of the Liberation War.

In the stage of socialist revolution, the Party criticized the right-leaning tendency to be content with the status quo of the small-peasant economy, pointed out the situation of the struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism in the rural areas, and pointed out that only by realizing cooperation can the worker-peasant alliance be further consolidated. Especially a year ago, when the upsurge of cooperation was about to arrive, Comrade Mao Zedong and the Sixth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party made a systematic criticism of the right-leaning thoughts on the issue of agricultural cooperation, thereby setting off an upsurge of the cooperative movement throughout the country, basically realizing agricultural cooperation in a short period of time, and promoting the socialist transformation of private industry, commerce, and handicrafts to simultaneously enter a high tide. This has enabled our country's socialist revolution to achieve a decisive victory.

**Three Main Experiences**

Through the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution, our Party has accumulated rich experience in the peasant movement for more than 30 years and in the continuous consolidation of the worker-peasant alliance. Among them, the most important, I think, are the following three points:

First, we must resolutely represent the fundamental interests of the peasants and be good at adapting to the peasants' current demands for their own immediate interests.

In the stage of democratic revolution, the fundamental interest of the peasants was to obtain land. If we cannot correctly put forward the anti-feudal land program, and if we do not seriously struggle to realize this program, the working class cannot establish a revolutionary alliance with the peasants, and we cannot mobilize the peasants, rely on the active support of the peasants, and win the victory of the revolutionary war. In the stage of socialist revolution, the fundamental demands of the peasants are to increase production, increase income, and improve their lives step by step, and this demand of the peasants is only possible under the conditions of realizing cooperation and resolutely embarking on the socialist road. Therefore, if we do not put forward the general line of socialist transformation in a timely manner, and if we do not lead the peasants to embark on the road of cooperation, we cannot guide the peasants to get rid of exploitation and poverty forever, and we cannot consolidate the worker-peasant alliance in the new historical period.

However, the peasants do not all have the determination to fight for their fundamental interests from the beginning. We must seize the urgent demands of the peasants in each period, mobilize the peasants to rise up and fight for their current interests, and gradually improve their class consciousness and confidence in victory through the peasants' own personal experience in the struggle. In this way, we can gradually guide the peasants from low to high to higher struggles, and finally realize their fundamental demands. Precisely because of this, in the land reform we did not go to confiscate and distribute land from the beginning, but seized the peasants' most urgent demand at that time to oppose the local tyrant's power, first launched the "suppression of bandits and anti-hegemony" struggle, followed by the "rent reduction and interest reduction" struggle, and then turned to the final stage of confiscating and distributing the landlords' land property. This was not only the case after the liberation of the whole country, but also the land revolution in the civil war period and the land reform in the newly liberated areas after the surrender of Japan similarly went through the struggles of "opposing exorbitant taxes and levies," "overthrowing local tyrants and evil gentry," "anti-traitors and liquidation," and "rent reduction and interest reduction." In the agricultural cooperative movement, we did not go to organize advanced cooperatives all at once, but adopted several roundabout transitional forms: first, seizing the peasants' urgent demand for mutual assistance in production after the land reform, mobilizing the peasants to organize various types of mutual aid groups; then, on the basis of the peasants seeing the superiority of collective labor with their own eyes and demanding further development of production, organize primary cooperatives with unified land management but still maintaining profit sharing according to the proportion of land and labor, which are of a semi-socialist nature; and finally, transition to advanced cooperatives of a fully socialist nature where remuneration is completely based on labor. This gradual deepening, gradual improvement, and gradual transition practice has proven to be completely in line with the development law of the peasant movement, completely necessary, and very successful.

Second, we must resolutely rely on the poor peasants and consolidate the unity of the middle peasants.

When there are still differences between poor peasants and middle peasants among the peasants, the Party must adopt the policy of resolutely relying on the poor peasants and consolidating the unity of the middle peasants. Only in this way can there be a truly consolidated worker-peasant alliance. In the land reform, if we did not resolutely rely on the poor peasants, if we did not organize the poor peasants first and then the middle peasants, if we did not cultivate the poor peasants to become the backbone of the movement, then the middle peasants would not closely rely on us, the enemies would not submit, and the movement would become weak and powerless, or even abandon halfway. After the land reform, many poor peasants rose to become new middle peasants, but except for a few upper-middle peasants, their economy was still unstable, and they politically actively supported our Party. Therefore, they are still a force that can be relied upon, just like the poor peasants. Therefore, the Party's policy during this period is to resolutely rely on the poor peasants and lower-middle peasants, consolidate the unity of the upper-middle peasants, absorb the poor peasants and lower-middle peasants into the cooperative first, and then absorb the upper-middle peasants into the cooperative, to establish the leading advantage of the poor peasants and lower-middle peasants. The right-leaning conservative errors committed by me and some rural work comrades on the eve of the high tide of socialist revolution were essentially underestimating the cooperative enthusiasm of the poor peasants and lower-middle peasants, being frightened by the wavering of the upper-middle peasants, and not daring to resolutely rely on the poor peasants and lower-middle peasants to continue moving forward by leaps and bounds.

However, if we only pay attention to relying on the poor peasants and do not pay attention to uniting the middle peasants, if we do not strictly protect the interests of the middle peasants in the land reform, if we do not adhere to the policy of voluntary mutual benefit in the cooperative movement, if we do not patiently wait for the awakening of the middle peasants but force them, if we do not take care of the interests of the middle peasants economically but infringe upon them, if we do not pay attention to absorbing the representatives of the middle peasants to participate in the leadership of the farmers' associations and cooperatives, then our Party and the poor peasants will be in an isolated position, and it will not be possible to form a consolidated worker-peasant alliance.

In addition to resolutely relying on the poor peasants and consolidating the unity of the middle peasants, the Party's class policy in the rural areas must also adopt a policy of differentiated treatment towards landlords and rich peasants: in the land reform, the property of the landlord class was confiscated without compensation, but they were still left with their due share; resolutely strike at the evil landlords and resistance saboteurs, but adopt a more lenient attitude towards general small and medium landlords; adopt a protection policy towards small land renters; only levy taxes on the rented portion of the rich peasants' land, abolish their usury, and leave all other property untouched, striving for the rich peasants to remain neutral in the land reform. In the early stages of the cooperative movement, we resolutely prohibited landlords and rich peasants from joining the cooperative, but after the arrival of the high tide of cooperation, we allowed landlords and rich peasant elements to join the cooperative as members, probationary members, or participate in labor within the cooperative. Now it seems that this policy of differentiated treatment is completely correct and has achieved remarkable results. Those "left" methods that do not differentiate, "fight everything," and "overthrow everything" actually not only cannot disintegrate the enemy, but will detach from their own masses, making the masses feel that we have gone too far, but sympathize with the enemy, thereby increasing the enemy's resistance. Obviously, this over-left approach is wrong and violates the Party's policy.

Third, we must adhere to the working method of the mass line from beginning to end.

The Party is the vanguard of the working people and also the servant of the working people, not the superior of the people, nor a philanthropist. Revolution cannot be realized by command or alms. History is created by the people, and the people have always relied on themselves to liberate themselves. The task of the Party in the peasant movement is to enlighten the peasants' class consciousness, so that they can act on their own and control their own destiny. The viewpoint of monopolizing and giving favors will stifle the peasants' consciousness and initiative, which is extremely harmful.

The historical experience of our Party's peasant movement for more than 30 years proves that if the peasant masses are not fully mobilized, cannot consciously organize and act, cannot establish their own political advantage in the rural areas, and rely on their own strength to defeat the enemy and liberate themselves, but rely on external forces, using administrative orders, monopolizing, or giving alms, then the peasants cannot be liberated. Even if they temporarily gain some benefits, it is unreliable. The worker-peasant alliance established under this circumstance can only be formal, cannot withstand storms, and is therefore not consolidated.

So how can we mobilize the peasant masses, so that they can consciously and voluntarily act, and form their own advantages in the rural areas? Historical experience proves that: we must combine the peasants' actual life experience and carry out arduous, in-depth, and vivid ideological education work among the peasants; we must go deep into the masses, use the organizational method of "rooting and connecting," to discover and cultivate the activists of hired peasants and poor peasants, and through them to contact the masses and lead the masses; we must adopt the method of "from point to area" and "point and area combination" to promote the development of the peasant movement; we must protect the enthusiasm of the masses in correcting deviations, and rely on their own consciousness to overcome the shortcomings that are unavoidable in the movement. Historical experience proves that whenever this is done, the peasant masses can definitely be fully mobilized, forming a great political force, thereby forming a consolidated worker-peasant alliance. If we adopt the opposite approach: do not carry out ideological education work among the peasants, or adopt empty preaching that is divorced from reality; do not carry out organizational work of "rooting and connecting" among the peasants, but only adopt the organizational method of opening a meeting to register members; in the development steps of the movement, it is not "from point to area" and "point and area combination," but adopt the so-called "lighting fires in every village, smoke billowing from every household," and "a rush of activity"; in correcting deviations, it is not through persuasion, through the masses consciously correcting, but adopt the method of "pouring cold water" and frustrating the enthusiasm of the masses; then the peasant masses will definitely not be mobilized, even if they are mobilized, they will "rush up in a swarm" and "disperse in a swarm." In this way, there can be no real peasant movement, no consolidated worker-peasant alliance, and no establishment of the Party's leading prestige among the peasants.

**Measures to Further Consolidate the Worker-Peasant Alliance**

At present, agricultural cooperation has basically been realized, and the worker-peasant alliance has entered a new historical stage. It is of great significance to apply these valuable historical experiences in light of the new situation and continue to maintain and strengthen the close relationship between the Party and the peasants for further consolidating the worker-peasant alliance on a socialist basis. After the realization of agricultural cooperation, many comrades often have an illusion: thinking that since the peasants have become socialist collective peasants, it seems that the issue of the worker-peasant alliance is insignificant, the interests of the peasants can be ignored, and the convenient condition that the peasants have been organized can be used to adopt administrative command working methods, without having to work among the peasants using the mass line again. All these views are very harmful. It must be understood that: although individual peasants have been cooperatized, the rural relations of production have undergone fundamental changes, the old contradictions have been resolved, and the old problems have passed, new contradictions are emerging, and new problems still need to be addressed. If we ignore this situation, thinking that everything is fine after cooperation, that the interests of the peasants can be ignored, and that we don't have to care so much about the lives of the masses, thereby developing subjectivism and commandism in peasant work, and being indifferent to the lives of the masses, then the worker-peasant alliance cannot be consolidated, and even has the danger of being destroyed. In order to further improve peasant work and further consolidate the worker-peasant alliance on the basis of consolidating the existing cooperatives under the new conditions, I think that in addition to implementing the instructions of the Party Central Committee and the State Council on strengthening the production leadership and organizational construction of agricultural cooperatives issued on September 12 this year, we must also correctly handle the following five issues:

First, we must maintain the compatibility of industrial and agricultural development in the process of realizing industrialization.

In the new historical period, gradually realizing the modernization of agriculture with the development of industrialization is the new economic foundation of the worker-peasant alliance. Obviously, without the development of heavy industry, it is impossible to fundamentally transform our agricultural technology, impossible to achieve agricultural modernization, impossible to greatly improve agricultural productivity, and impossible to make peasants prosperous and get rid of poverty forever. Without the development of light industry, it is impossible to meet the peasants' growing needs for industrial products in production and life. From this, it can be seen that realizing national industrialization is the fundamental interest of the people of the whole country, and also the fundamental interest of 500 million peasants. Without grasping this basic link, it is impossible to continue to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance.

However, the development of industry requires the development of agriculture to be compatible with it. If agricultural production cannot keep up with the requirements of industrial development, cannot meet the needs of industrial development for grain, raw materials, capital accumulation, and markets, the result will only be to force the pace of industrialization to slow down, or to make the relationship between the worker-peasant alliance tense. We can recall that due to the extraordinary flood in 1954, agricultural production suffered a greater loss, which affected the speed of industrial development in 1955, and even caused a tense situation in the grain problem in the spring of 1955. Therefore, it is necessary to correctly formulate plans, pay corresponding investment, and make great efforts to enable the relatively backward agricultural production to maintain a compatible development with industry. Without grasping this point, it is impossible to continue to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance.

From this, it can be seen that maintaining the compatibility of industrial and agricultural development is of decisive significance for continuing to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance. The first Five-Year Plan of our country's socialist construction and the proposals of the Party Central Committee on the second Five-Year Plan and Comrade Zhou Enlai's report all correctly handled this issue. We should continue to move forward along this correct direction.

Second, we must take effective measures to vigorously develop agricultural production.

Developing agricultural production is not only conducive to the interests of industrialization and in line with the long-term interests of the peasants, but also in line with the current urgent demands of the peasants. We must be able to help peasants develop production and improve their lives in order to consolidate the existing cooperatives, consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, and lead the peasants to move forward together to complete socialist construction.

Due to the limitations of our industrial conditions and the country's economic capabilities, we will not be able to have a large number of agricultural machines and chemical fertilizers in a short period of time, and it is impossible to reclaim wasteland on a large scale to expand the cultivated land area. Therefore, the main way for our current agricultural production to increase production can only be to take various production increase measures on existing land to expand the multiple cropping index and increase the yield per unit area, and at the same time, try to reclaim some wasteland as much as possible under possible conditions to expand the cultivated land area. This is the basic direction of our current agricultural production increase. On the other hand, we have superior natural conditions, abundant human resources, traditional experience in intensive cultivation, and basically realized agricultural cooperation. With these superior conditions, we can rely on the labor enthusiasm and creativity of the vast number of peasants on the basis of cooperation, use the superior natural conditions, to fully tap the huge potential power of the existing land. As long as we really make great efforts to build water conservancy, prevent floods, develop fertilizer sources, improve the soil, and carry out the selection of good seeds, promote new agricultural tools, prevent and control diseases and insect pests, improve cultivation techniques, and change the cultivation system and other production increase measures, relying on these measures, we will definitely be able to increase the multiple cropping index and increase the yield per unit area on the existing land to achieve the purpose of agricultural production increase. This has also been clearly pointed out in the reports of Comrades Liu Shaoqi and Zhou Enlai, and we should adopt a positive policy to promote these measures according to this direction. It is wrong to be passive and conservative; but at the same time, we must adapt to local conditions, take steady steps, and resolutely overcome the phenomenon of subjectivism and coercion. According to the experience of the past few years, as long as we do the above work well, we will definitely be able to complete or exceed the agricultural production increase task required by the second Five-Year Plan.

Shaoqi and Enlai's reports pointed out that another aspect of developing agricultural production is to develop diversified operations. Our country's peasants have always had the habit of diversified operations. Due to the lack of cultivated land in our country, peasants in many places cannot maintain their lives by simply cultivating fields, and therefore they have to find ways to make a living in all aspects. Therefore, our agricultural production must focus on increasing the production of grain and cotton, but at the same time, we must develop animal husbandry, forestry, fishery, horticulture, transportation, handicrafts and other sideline production in accordance with local conditions. These productions and agricultural production are mutually dependent and mutually supportive. It is not conducive to emphasize one aspect and ignore the other. In addition, it is necessary to properly arrange the production of grain and cash crops. Now it seems that the phenomenon of grain and cash crops competing for land and insufficient feed is worthy of attention. Our country's grain is not very abundant. The average grain yield per capita in some areas such as the provinces of the North China Plain is the lowest compared with the whole country, while several major cash crops such as cotton, peanuts, and soybeans are mainly concentrated in these areas. Other areas also have similar phenomena. Whether to have grain or cash crops has become a very prominent contradiction among the peasants in these areas. In order to solve the grain problem in these areas, in order to ensure that cash crops can develop according to plan, in addition to taking the above measures to double our efforts to increase grain production, I think it is absolutely necessary for the state to appropriately increase a part of agricultural investment in order to develop more water conservancy construction in these areas, eradicate water damage, expand irrigation, and reclaim some wasteland as much as possible under possible conditions.

In order to comprehensively develop agricultural and sideline production, we also need to have a correct price policy and do a good job in the purchase of agricultural products to cooperate. Reasonable prices will stimulate the production of agriculture and sideline occupations. Unreasonable prices, if the peasants have no profits to gain, will have a negative effect on production. At present, the purchase prices of general agricultural and sideline products are reasonable, and the purchase work is generally done well, but there are still some products with unreasonable purchase prices, some products with overly complicated purchase procedures, and the attitude of the purchasers is not good. This has had a certain negative effect on agricultural and sideline production. In order to develop agricultural and sideline production, it is necessary to appropriately adjust these unreasonable prices and simplify the purchase procedures, so that the cooperatives and peasants can have profits to gain and convenient purchases and sales, so as to stimulate their production enthusiasm. Of course, when adjusting prices, we must also pay attention to maintaining a reasonable ratio between various commodity prices, so as to avoid the problem of price increases in turn.

Third, we must correctly handle the relationship between the state and the peasants, mainly correctly handle the relationship between state capital accumulation and peasant personal consumption.

For the great socialist construction, it is necessary to obtain a certain capital accumulation from the agricultural sector. This accumulation is to create greater happiness for the peasants and all working people, which is in line with the fundamental interests of the peasants. However, if this capital is accumulated too much and too quickly, so that the living standards of the peasants cannot be improved year by year with the development of production, or even decrease, it will cause dissatisfaction among the peasants, and it will hinder the worker-peasant alliance and hinder the smooth progress of the national construction cause. Of course, the state's capital accumulation cannot be too little, otherwise it will postpone industrialization, which is also not conducive to the consolidation of the worker-peasant alliance.

From this, it can be seen that correctly handling this relationship, so that there is a correct proportion between state accumulation and personal consumption, is an important aspect of consolidating the worker-peasant alliance under the new historical conditions. For this reason, the state should always pay attention to maintaining this correct proportion in terms of agricultural and sideline taxes and the prices of industrial and agricultural products. In terms of requisitioning peasant land and calling up civilian workers, it is also necessary to appropriately take care of the interests of the peasants. One-sided national concepts and one-sided mass viewpoints are not right.

Another aspect of the relationship between the state and the peasants is to correctly handle the state's planned guidance relationship with the cooperatives. That is, on the one hand, the main production of the cooperatives should be included in the state's planned guidance, and on the other hand, the independence of the cooperatives' production and operation should be maintained. Since our country is very large, and there are too many agricultural and sideline products, and it is too limited by geographical and natural conditions, the state's agricultural production plan cannot be too detailed and inflexible, and there should be a certain degree of flexibility and maneuverability. We should gradually change the current system of the state stipulating production targets to the future state stipulating only the allocation targets for each province, the provinces and counties stipulating only the procurement targets for each cooperative, and the state economic departments signing procurement contracts with the cooperatives. The cooperatives have the right to formulate their own production plans according to the needs and possibilities of the members and in accordance with local conditions and in a timely manner, in addition to completing the state's procurement targets and fulfilling the contract obligations of the economic departments. The surplus products in addition to completing the procurement tasks and fulfilling the contract obligations can also be freely disposed of, and the state should not interfere in everything. Doing so can greatly stimulate the enthusiasm of the peasants, and it is not harmful to the state.

Fourth, in agricultural cooperatives, we must correctly handle the relationship between the cooperative and the individual members, so as to mobilize the enthusiasm of the vast number of members.

After the realization of agricultural cooperation, solving the basic contradiction between the small-peasant economy and the socialist economy, the relationship between personal interests and collective interests has become the most prominent issue within the cooperative. Correctly handling this issue is an important key to consolidating the cooperative, and it is also an important factor in consolidating the worker-peasant alliance. This requires:

In terms of the distribution of cooperative products, we should adopt the policy of "deducting less and distributing more," that is, the policy of "ensuring the needs of collective production and taking care of the needs of the members' lives." The central instructions: 60% to 70% of the total income of the cooperative should be allocated to the members, striving for 90% of the members to be able to increase their income, which is the specific policy boundary for realizing this policy at present. After the practice of summer harvest distribution this year, it has been proven that the central instructions are completely correct. In future distribution work, we must continue to implement these instructions. As production increases year by year, more and more members should be able to increase their personal income.

In terms of the cooperative's production and operation, we should adopt the policy of "large concentration and small decentralization." Under the current conditions, the cooperative should concentrate its efforts on doing a good job in the main agricultural production and the major sideline production that must be centrally operated, and hand over other sideline occupations and family handicrafts that are conducive to decentralized operation to the members for decentralized operation. In this way, on the one hand, it is convenient for the members to increase their income and give play to their enthusiasm, and on the other hand, it is convenient for the cooperative to concentrate its efforts on doing a good job in the main production. This rational division of labor is in line with the actual production and living needs of the cooperative and its members. Therefore, in addition to the members completing the production tasks and the prescribed labor days stipulated by the cooperative according to the plan, the members should be allowed to have a certain amount of labor time at their own disposal to operate family sideline occupations and the production of private plots, and should not restrict them. Now some cooperatives restrict members from engaging in sideline occupations, and even restrict members from growing vegetables, raising pigs, and raising chickens and ducks, which has aroused dissatisfaction among the members and caused certain losses. This mistake should be quickly corrected.

In terms of the handling of means of production, we should adopt the method of "mainly public ownership, secondarily private ownership." According to the cooperative's charter, the main means of production such as the members' land, draught animals, and large agricultural tools must be collectively owned by the cooperative, and the small agricultural tools, small tools, scattered trees, and livestock and poultry needed by the members to operate family sideline production are privately owned by the members. This regulation is reasonable and necessary for the development of production, because it can help the members solve their daily production and living needs, and avoid the cooperative being unable to meet their daily needs and causing dissatisfaction and complaints against the cooperative, thereby helping to unite them; for the peasants who have not joined the cooperative, it can also dispel their ideological concerns and attract them to actively participate in the cooperative.

In terms of handling the relationship between members, we must adopt the policy of "taking care of both sides," that is, the policy of "taking care of the interests of poor peasant members and taking care of the interests of middle peasant members." After agricultural cooperation, the relationship between poor peasants and middle peasants based on common rise and common prosperity is more united than in the past, and with the public ownership of the main means of production, the boundary between poor peasants and middle peasants will gradually disappear. However, in a certain period of time after the establishment of the cooperative, there will still be some different economic interests between them, and there will be certain differences in ideology for a considerable period of time. Therefore, the Party's class policy in the rural areas should still implement the policy of relying on the poor peasants and consolidating the unity of the middle peasants, and should take care of both the opinions of the poor peasants and the opinions of the middle peasants in handling some economic problems left over from the transfer of cooperatives and the merger of cooperatives, as well as in terms of income distribution and cooperative management, so as to make them better united and do a good job in production.

In terms of cooperative organizational leadership, we must implement the principle of "combining democracy and centralism" to achieve "democratic management of the cooperative." Being able to implement centralism is one of the advantages of advanced cooperatives. However, centralism must be built on the basis of promoting democracy. All production plans, production increase measures, distribution plans, etc. should come from the masses and go back to the masses. Without democracy, centralism will become subjectivism, monopolization, and arbitrary decision-making. Like a cooperative with a large collective economy that includes hundreds, hundreds, or thousands of households, if democracy is not fully promoted among the members, the working style of the mass line is not continued, so as to give play to the enthusiasm of all members and rely on the collective wisdom and strength to run the cooperative, but only a few cooperative cadres, technicians, or cadres stationed in the cooperative sent by the higher authorities monopolize everything, then the cooperative will definitely not be run well. In this regard, the main problems that currently exist are: too much centralism and too little democracy, and subjectivism and commandism are not isolated phenomena. Many comrades only unilaterally use the centralized aspect to carry out work, but do not pay attention to the other aspect, promoting democracy and mobilizing the masses to carry out work. This situation must be quickly changed.

Fifth, we must continue to strengthen the Party's political leadership and ideological education work for the peasants.

After the peasants join the cooperative, it is more convenient for the Party to conduct political work and ideological education work for the peasants through the cooperative. At the same time, after cooperation, it is even more necessary for the Party to strengthen its leadership over the cooperative, because: In the era of individual economy, the production and life of the peasants were arranged by themselves. After cooperation, the responsibility for leading production has shifted to the cooperative. In order to enable the cooperative cadres to truly assume this responsibility and live up to the peasants' hopes for it, the Party needs to help the cooperative from all aspects such as politics, economy, and organization. It should be understood that: although the peasants have joined the cooperative, their original ideological viewpoints and traditional habits cannot be completely changed in a short period of time. In order to prevent these ideological viewpoints and traditional habits from harming the collective cause, the Party must continue to strengthen their ideological education work. In particular, we must strengthen the ideological education of cadres and Party members to prevent all possible corruption and detachment from the masses. For this reason, the Party committees at all levels must continue to strengthen the leadership work of the cooperative in accordance with the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee; in particular, it is necessary to strengthen the organizational work of the grassroots Party, so that the branch truly becomes the core of leading the cooperative and uniting the vast number of members. At present, the phenomenon of weakening the leadership of the branch due to the withdrawal of districts and the merger of townships and the transfer of cadres at all levels must be overcome. We should be good at using the socialist school of the cooperative, strengthen the socialist and collectivist education of the peasants from the daily production and life of the peasants, so that the peasants can further consolidate the alliance with the working class politically, economically, and ideologically, and advance victoriously under the leadership of the Party and the working class.

    在社会主义基础上进一步巩固工农联盟
    国务院副总理中共中央农村工作部部长邓子恢同志的发言
    我完全同意中央委员会的政治报告、关于修改党的章程的报告，和关于第二个五年计划的建议的报告，我认为自党的第七次全国代表大会以来以毛泽东同志为首的中央委员会的政治路线和组织路线是完全正确的，这些报告系统地精辟地总结了我们党自七大以来的经验教训，正确地提出了今后建设国家建设党的方针、任务和准则。我现在仅就农民运动和工农联盟问题发表一些意见。
    建设社会主义的根本保证
    旧中国是一个半封建半殖民地落后的农业国家，又是一个幅员广大，人口众多的国家，农民占全国人口的绝大多数，其中大部分又是贫农、半无产者，具有高度的革命性，并有武装斗争的历史传统。在这种具体情况下，中国工人阶级和共产党要完成革命任务，就必须以农民为革命的主力；在革命胜利以后的社会主义建设中，农业又是工业发展的基础，在实现工业化的过程中五亿农民仍然处于极端重要的地位，这就是中国革命最根本的特点。因此正确地认识农民的伟大作用，正确地处理工农联盟问题，不仅是中国革命成功的根本保证，而且也是今后社会主义建设胜利的根本保证。
    在民主革命阶段，一切“左”、右倾机会主义者都在农民问题上犯了错误，他们不了解中国革命的特点，不了解中国农民伟大的革命作用，不愿意去依靠农民，不把农民当作革命的主力，这就是一切“左”、右倾机会主义错误的主要共同点，也就是他们在工农联盟问题上与马克思列宁主义者的基本分歧点。只有毛泽东同志为代表的正确领导才真正认识了中国革命的特点，认识了农民的伟大的革命作用，确定了在党的领导下依靠农民进行革命的基本路线，从而正确地处理了工农联盟问题，并且规定了中国革命不是走城市工人起义夺取政权的道路，而是依靠农民先在乡村建立革命根据地，来发展革命武装，壮大革命力量，造成乡村包围城市的形势，而后解放城市，解放全中国，这就正确地解决了中国革命发展的具体道路问题。特别是经过一九四二年以来的整风学习和党的第七次全国代表大会，从思想上彻底批判了“左”右倾机会主义的错误，提高了广大党员干部的思想水平。因而，在第七次全国代表大会以后，各个革命根据地就更加充分地发动了农民群众，积蓄了巨大的革命力量，这就是我们所以能够迅速赢得解放战争胜利的一个最根本因素。
    在社会主义革命阶段，党批判了安于小农经济现状的右的倾向，指出了农村阵地社会主义不去占领、资本主义必去占领的两条道路斗争的形势，指出了必须实现合作化才能够继续巩固工农联盟的道理。特别是一年以前，当合作化高潮即将到来的时候，毛泽东同志和党的七届六中全会对农业合作化问题上的右倾思想做了系统的批判，从而在全国范围内掀起了合作化运动的高潮，在短时期内基本上实现了农业合作化，并且推动了私人工商业和手工业的社会主义改造同时进入高潮，这就使我国的社会主义革命取得了决定性的胜利。
    三点主要经验
    经过民主革命和社会主义革命，我们党在三十多年的农民运动中，在不断地巩固工农联盟中，积累了丰富的经验。其中最重要的，我认为有以下三点：
    第一、必须坚决代表农民的根本利益，又必须善于适应农民当前的切身利益要求
    在民主革命阶段，农民的根本利益是获得土地。如果我们不能正确地提出反封建的土地纲领，如果我们不认真地为实现这种纲领而奋斗，工人阶级就不可能和农民建立起革命联盟，我们也就不能够发动农民，依靠农民的积极支持，而赢得革命战争的胜利。在社会主义革命阶段，农民的根本要求是增加生产，增加收入，一步一步地改善自己的生活，而农民的这种要求，只有在实现合作化，坚决走上社会主义道路的条件下才有可能。因此，如果我们不及时地提出社会主义改造的总路线，如果我们不领导农民走上合作化的道路，我们就不能够引导农民永远摆脱剥削和贫困，也就不能够在新的历史时期巩固工农联盟。
    但是，农民并不是一开始就都有决心为自己的根本利益而斗争的，我们必须抓住农民每一个时期的迫切要求，发动农民起来为当前利益而斗争，在斗争中经过农民自己的亲身体验，逐步提高他们的阶级觉悟与胜利信心。这样，才能一步一步地由低到高地引导农民走向更高的斗争，而最后去实现他们的根本要求。正因为如此，所以在土地改革中我们并不是一开始就去没收和分配土地，而是抓住农民当时反对地主当权派的最迫切要求，先发动“剿匪反霸”斗争，紧接着又进行“减租减息”斗争，以后才转入没收和分配地主的土地财产的最后阶段。这不仅在全国解放以后是如此，就在内战时期的土地革命和日本投降后新解放区的土地改革也同样经过了“反对苛捐杂税”，“打倒土豪劣绅”，“反奸清算”，“减租减息”等斗争过程。在农业合作化运动中我们也不是一下子就去组织高级合作社，而是采取了若干迂回曲折的过渡形式：先抓住农民在土地改革以后生产上尚有困难需要互助的迫切要求，发动农民组织各种类型的互助组；然后在农民亲眼看到了集体劳动的优越性，要求进一步发展生产的基础上，再组织土地统一经营，但仍然保持土地劳力比例分红的半社会主义性质的初级合作社；最后才转到完全按劳取酬的全社会主义性质的高级合作社。这种逐步深入，逐步提高，逐步过渡的做法，事实证明是完全符合于农民运动的发展规律的，是完全必要的，也是非常成功的。
    第二、必须坚决依靠贫农，巩固地团结中农
    在农民中还存在着贫农和中农差别的时候，党就必须采取坚决依靠贫农，又巩固地团结中农的政策，只有如此，才能有真正巩固的工农联盟。在土地改革中如果我们不是坚决依靠贫农，不是先组织贫农而后组织中农，如果不去培养贫农成为运动的中坚，那中农就不会紧密地靠拢我们，敌人就不会屈服，运动也就会变得软弱无力，甚至于半途而废。经过了土地改革，有许多贫农上升为新中农，但是，他们当中除了少数上中农而外，经济上仍然是不稳定的，政治上是积极拥护我们党的，因此他们仍然同贫农一样是可以依靠的力量。所以这个时期党的政策就是坚决依靠贫农和下中农，巩固地团结上中农，就是先吸收贫农、下中农入社，而后吸收上中农入社，就是要树立贫农和下中农的领导优势。在社会主义革命高潮前夕，我和一些农村工作同志所犯的右倾保守错误，其实质就是对贫农和下中农的合作积极性估计不足，被上中农的动摇所吓倒，而不敢坚决依靠贫农和下中农大踏步地继续前进。
    但是，如果我们只注意依靠贫农，而不注意团结中农，如果我们不在土地改革中严格保护中农的利益，不在合作化运动中坚持自愿互利政策，不是耐心地等待中农的觉悟而是加以强迫，不在经济上照顾中农利益而是加以侵犯，如果我们不注意吸收中农的代表人物参加农会和合作社的领导，那么我们党和贫农就会陷于孤立的地位，也就不可能形成巩固的工农联盟。
    党在农村中的阶级政策，除了坚决依靠贫农，巩固地团结中农之外，还必须对地主富农采取区别对待的政策：在土地改革中，对地主阶级的财产是无偿没收，但仍然留下他们应得的一份；对恶霸地主和抵抗破坏分子坚决打击，但对一般中小地主则采取比较宽大的态度；对小土地出租者则采取保护政策；对富农只征收其出租部分的土地，取消其高利贷，其他财产一律不动，争取富农在土地改革中守中立。在合作化运动初期，我们坚决禁止地主富农入社，但在合作化高潮到来之后，则又允许地主富农分子分别入社为社员、候补社员，或参加社内劳动。现在看来，这种区别对待的政策是完全正确的，也收到了显著的效果。那些不加区别，“一切皆斗”、“打倒一切”的“左”的办法，实际上不仅不能分化敌人，反而会脱离自己的群众，使群众感觉到我们做得太过火，反而同情敌人，从而增加敌人的抵抗。显然这种过左的作法是错误的，是违反党的政策的。
    第三、必须自始至终坚持群众路线的工作方法
    党是劳动人民的先锋队，也是劳动人民的勤务员，不是人民的上司，也不是慈善家，革命不是用命令或者施舍的方法可以实现的。历史是人民创造的，人民历来是依靠自己解放自己。党在农民运动中的任务就在于启发农民的阶级觉悟，使他们自己行动起来，掌握自己的命运，包办代替和恩赐观点，是会窒息农民的自觉性和自动性，是极端有害的。
    我们党三十多年农民运动的历史经验证明，如果农民群众没有充分发动，不能自觉地组织起来和行动起来，不能在农村中确立自己的政治优势，依靠自己的力量去战胜敌人，解放自己，而是靠外来力量，用行政命令、包办代替或者恩赐施舍的做法，这样农民是不可能得到解放的，即使暂时得到了一些利益，也是靠不住的。在这种情况下建立起来的工农联盟只能是形式的，经不起风浪的，从而也就是不巩固的。
    那么如何才能发动农民群众，使他们自觉自愿地行动起来，在农村中形成自己的优势呢？历史经验证明：必须结合农民实际的生活经验在农民中进行艰苦的深入的生动的思想教育工作；必须深入群众，用“扎根串连”的组织方法，去发现与培养雇农和贫农的积极分子，并通过他们去联系群众，带动群众；必须采取“由点到面”、“点面结合”的方式，去推进农民运动的发展；必须在纠正偏向中保护群众的积极性，依靠他们自己的觉悟去克服运动中所不可避免的缺点。历史经验证明，凡是这样做的，农民群众就一定可以充分发动起来，形成一个伟大的政治力量，从而形成巩固的工农联盟。如果采取相反的做法：不在农民中进行思想教育工作，或者采取脱离实际的空洞说教；不在农民中进行“扎根串连”的组织工作，而只采取开大会报名入会的组织方式；在运动发展步骤上不是“由点到面”、“点面结合”，而是采取所谓“村村点火、户户冒烟”、“一轰而起”的作法；在纠偏中不是经过说服，经过群众自觉纠正，而是采取“泼冷水”的挫折群众积极性的办法；那么农民群众是肯定地发动不起来，就是发动起来也会“一哄而起”、“一哄而散”。这样，就不可能有真正的农民运动，不可能有巩固的工农联盟，也就不可能在农民中树立党的领导威信。
    进一步巩固工农联盟的措施
    目前农业合作化已经基本上实现了，工农联盟已经进入了一个新的历史阶段。根据新的情况来运用这些宝贵的历史经验，继续保持和加强党与农民的密切关系，对于在社会主义基础上进一步巩固工农联盟，是具有重大意义的。在实现了农业合作化以后，许多同志往往产生一种错觉：以为农民既然成了社会主义的集体农民，仿佛工农联盟问题就无足重轻了，农民的利益就可以不加重视了，就可以利用农民已经组织起来这个便利条件，采取行政命令的工作方法，而不必再用群众路线在农民中去进行工作了，这种种看法都是非常有害的。必须了解：尽管个体农民已经合作化，农村生产关系已经发生了根本变化，旧的矛盾虽已解决，旧的问题已经过去，但新的矛盾又在产生，新的问题仍要出现，如果我们忽视这种情况，以为合作化以后万事大吉，以为农民利益可以忽视，群众生活可以不必那样关心了，从而在农民工作中发展了主观主义和命令主义，对群众生活漠不关心，这样，工农联盟就同样是不能巩固的，甚至有被破坏的危险。为了在新的条件下，进一步做好农民工作，在巩固现有合作社的基础上进一步巩固工农联盟，我认为除了按照今年九月十二日党中央和国务院关于加强对农业合作社的生产领导和组织建设的指示贯彻执行外，还必须正确地处理以下五个问题：
    第一、必须在实现工业化的过程中，保持工农业发展相适应
    在新的历史时期，随着工业化的发展，逐步实现农业的现代化，乃是工农联盟的新的经济基础。显然，如果没有重工业的发展，就不可能从根本上改造我们的农业技术，就不可能达到农业现代化，就不可能大大提高农业的生产力，也就不可能使农民富裕起来，永远摆脱贫困。如果没有轻工业的发展，也不能满足农民在生产、生活上对工业品日益增长的需要。从此可见，实现国家工业化是全国人民的根本利益，也是五亿农民的根本利益。不抓住这个基本环节，就不可能继续巩固工农联盟。
    但是，工业的发展需要农业发展与之相适应。如果农业生产赶不上工业发展的要求，不能满足工业发展对于粮食、原料、资金积累和市场的需要，结果就只有使工业化的速度被迫降低，或者使工农联盟的关系紧张起来。我们可以回忆一下，由于一九五四年有了特大水灾，农业生产遭到了较大的损失，就影响了一九五五年工业发展的速度，而且在一九五五年春天还一度引起了粮食问题的紧张局势。因此，必须正确地拟订计划，付出相应的投资，并且作出巨大的努力，使比较落后的农业生产能够和工业保持相适应的发展。不抓住这一点，也就不能继续巩固工农联盟。
    由此可见，保持工农业发展相适应，对于继续巩固工农联盟，具有决定的意义。我国社会主义建设的第一个五年计划和党中央关于第二个五年计划的建议和周恩来同志的报告，都正确地处理了这个问题，我们应当遵循着这个正确方向继续前进。
    第二、必须采取有效措施，大力发展农业生产
    发展农业生产不仅有利于工业化的利益，符合于农民的长远利益，也符合于农民当前的迫切要求。我们要能够帮助农民发展生产，改善生活，才能够巩固现有合作社、巩固工农联盟，才能够领导农民共同前进来完成社会主义建设。
    由于我们的工业条件和国家的经济能力所限，在短时期内我们还不可能有大批的农业机器和化学肥料，不可能大规模垦荒来扩大耕地面积。因此我们目前农业增产的主要途径，只能在现有土地上采取各种增产措施来扩大复种指数，提高单位面积产量，同时在可能条件下尽可能开垦一些荒地，以扩大耕地面积，这就是当前我们农业增产的基本方向。另一方面，我们有优厚的自然条件，充沛的人力资源、精耕细作的传统经验，而又基本上实现了农业合作化。有了这些优越条件，我们就可以在合作化基础上依靠广大农民的劳动积极性和创造性，利用优厚的自然条件，来充分挖掘现有土地的巨大的潜在力量。只要我们真正用大力去兴修水利，防止水患，开发肥源，改良土壤，并进行选用良种，推广新式农具，防治病虫害，改进耕作技术，改变耕作制度等增产措施，依靠这些措施我们也就一定能够在现有土地上增加复种指数，提高单位面积产量，来达到农业增产的目的。这在刘少奇、周恩来同志的报告中也已经明确地指出来了，我们应该按照这个方向采取积极的方针来推行这些措施，消极保守是不对的；但同时又必须因地制宜、采取稳进的步骤，而坚决克服主观主义和强迫命令的现象。根据几年来的经验，只要做好上述这些工作，我们是一定可以完成或超额完成第二个五年计划所要求的农业增产的任务的。
    少奇、恩来同志报告中指出发展农业生产的另一方面，必须发展多种经营。我国农民历来都有多种经营的习惯，由于我国耕地不足，许多地方农民光靠耕田种地就不可能维持生活，从而也就不能不从各方面找活路。因此，我们的农业生产必须以增产粮棉为重点，但同时必须因地制宜地发展畜牧业、林业、渔业、园艺业、运输业、手工业及其他副业生产。这些生产和农业生产都是互相依赖而又互相支援的，只强调一面而忽视另一面都是不利的。此外，还必须妥善安排粮食与经济作物的生产。现在看来，粮食与经济作物争地和饲料不足的现象是值得注意的。我国粮食并不是很充裕的，某些地区如华北平原各省每人平均的粮食产量，在全国比较起来是最低的，而几种大宗经济作物如棉花、花生、大豆等又主要集中在这些地区。其他有些地区也有类似现象。要粮食还是要经济作物，就成为这些地区农民中很突出的矛盾，为了解决这些地区的粮食问题，以便保证经济作物能按计划发展，除了采取上述措施加倍努力来增产粮食之外，我认为国家适当地增加一部分农业投资，以便在这些地区多发展一些水利建设，根治水害，扩大灌溉，并在可能条件下多开垦一些荒地，是十分必要的。
    为了全面地发展农业和副业生产，还需要有正确的价格政策和做好农产品的收购工作来配合。价格合理，就会对农业和副业起刺激生产的作用，价格不合理，使农民无利可图，就会起不利于生产的反作用。目前一般农业和副业产品的收购价格是合理的，收购工作一般也是做得好的，但是仍然有某些产品的收购价格不合理，某些产品的收购手续过于繁琐，收购人员的态度不好，这对农业和副业生产是起了一定的反作用。为了发展农业和副业生产，就必须适当调整这些不合理价格，并简化收购手续，务使合作社和农民有利可图，购销方便，以便刺激他们的生产积极性。当然在调整价格时，也要注意使各种物价之间，保持一个合理比价，以免造成轮番提价的毛病。
    第三、必须正确地处理国家和农民之间的关系，主要是正确处理国家资金积累和农民个人消费之间的关系
    为了伟大的社会主义建设，必须从农业方面取得一定的资金积累。这种积累，是为了给农民和所有劳动人民创造更大的幸福，这是符合农民的根本利益的。但是，如果这种资金积累得过多过快，使农民的生活水平不能随着生产发展而逐年有所提高，甚至反而降低了，那就会引起农民的不满，也就会妨碍工农联盟，妨碍国家建设事业的顺利前进。当然，国家资金积累也不能过少，否则就会推迟工业化，这也同样不利于工农联盟的巩固。
    从此可见，正确处理这个关系，使国家积累和个人消费之间，有一个正确的比例，乃是在新的历史条件下巩固工农联盟的一个重要方面。为此，国家在农业和副业税收和工业农业产品的价格方面，应该经常注意保持这种正确的比例，在征用农民土地和调用民工等方面，也要适当照顾农民的利益，片面的国家观念和片面的群众观点都是不对的。
    国家与农民关系的另一方面，还要正确处理国家对合作社的计划指导关系。这就是一方面要把合作社的主要生产纳入国家的计划指导之下，另一方面又要保持合作社生产经营的独立性。由于我们国家很大，农业和副业产品太多，受地域性与自然条件的限制又太大，因此，国家对农业生产计划不能订得太细太死，应该有一定的灵活性机动性。应该逐步改变现在由国家规定生产指标的制度过渡到将来国家只规定各省的调拨指标，各省、县只规定各社的征购指标，国家经济部门则同合作社订立采购合同。合作社在完成国家的征购指标和履行经济部门的合同义务以外，有权根据社员的需要和可能因地制宜、因时制宜来制定自己的生产计划。除了完成征购任务及履行合同义务以外的多余产品也可以自由支配，国家不要样样去干涉他们。这样做可以大大发挥农民的积极性，而对国家又并无害处。
    第四、在农业合作社中，必须正确地处理社与社员个人之间的关系，以调动广大社员的积极性
    在实现了农业合作化，解决了小农经济与社会主义经济之间的基本矛盾以后，个人利益与集体利益之间的关系，就成为合作社内部一个最突出的问题。正确处理这个问题，是巩固合作社的一个重要关键，也是巩固工农联盟的一个重要因素。这就要求：
    在合作社的产品分配方面，要采取“少扣多分”的方针，就是要“既保证集体生产需要、又照顾社员生活需要”的方针。中央指示：要把合作社总收入的百分之六十到七十分配给社员，争取百分之九十的社员能够增加收入，正是当前实现这条方针的具体的政策界限。经过今年夏收分配的实践，证明中央的指示是完全正确的。今后在分配工作中，必须继续贯彻执行这个指示。随着生产一年年的增加，应该做到越来越多的社员都能够增加个人收入。
    在合作社的生产经营方面，应该采取“大的集中、小的分散”的方针。在目前条件下，合作社应该集中力量搞好主要的农业生产和必须集中经营的大宗副业生产，而把其他利于分散经营的副业和家庭手工业都交给社员去分散经营。这样，一方面便于社员增加收入，发挥他们的积极性，另一方面又便于合作社集中精力搞好主要生产。这种合理分工是符合于社和社员实际生产和生活的需要的。因此，在社员按计划完成社所规定的生产任务和规定的劳动日以外，应该允许社员有一定的劳动时间由他们自己支配，去经营家庭副业和自留地的生产，而不应该去限制他们。现在有些合作社限制社员搞副业，甚至限制社员种菜、喂猪、养鸡鸭，已引起社员不满，并造成了一定损失，这种错误应该迅速纠正。
    在生产资料处理方面，应该采取“主要公有，次要私有”的办法。按照社章规定，社员的土地、耕畜与大农具等主要生产资料必须归社集体所有，社员经营家庭副业生产所需要的小农具、小工具、零星树木和家畜、家禽等都归社员私有。这种规定是合情合理的，对发展生产也是非常必要的，因为这样既可以帮助社员解决日常生产生活需要，而避免由于社不能满足他们日常需要而对社发生不满与埋怨情绪，从而有利于团结他们；对未入社的农民，又可以解除他们的思想顾虑，吸引他们积极地参加到合作社中来。
    在处理社员相互间的关系方面，必须采取“双方兼顾”的政策，就是“既照顾贫农社员利益，又照顾中农社员利益”的政策。农业合作化以后，建立在共同上升、共同富裕基础上的贫农和中农之间的关系，是比过去更加团结了，而且随着主要生产资料的公有化，贫农和中农之间的界限，也将逐渐消失。但是在建社后的一定时期内，他们之间还将存在着若干不同的经济利益，思想上更会在相当长的时间内存在着一定的差别。因此，目前党在农村中的阶级政策，仍然应该贯彻执行依靠贫农、巩固地团结中农的政策，在处理转社并社时所遗留下来的一些经济问题以及在收益分配、社务管理等方面，都应该既照顾贫农的意见，又照顾中农的意见，以便使他们更好地团结一致，把生产工作做好。
    在合作社组织领导方面，必须实行“民主与集中相结合”的原则，实现“民主办社”。能够实行集中，正是高级合作社的优越性之一。但是集中必须是建立在发扬民主的基础之上，一切生产计划、增产措施、分配方案等决议，应该从群众中来，再到群众中去。没有民主，集中就会变成主观主义、包办代替和独断专行。像合作社这样包括百把户几百户千把户的大型集体经济，如果不在社员中充分发扬民主，继续坚持群众路线的工作作风，以便发挥所有社员的积极性，依靠集体的智慧与力量来办社，而只是由少数社干部、技术员、或上级派来的驻社干部包办一切，那么社就一定办不好。在这方面，目前存在的主要问题是：集中太多，而民主太少，主观主义与命令主义并不是个别现象。许多同志只片面地利用集中的一面去进行工作，而不注意另一方面，发扬民主、动员群众来进行工作，这种情况必须迅速改变。
    第五、必须继续加强党对农民的政治领导与思想教育工作
    农民参加合作社之后，就更便于党通过合作社去向农民进行政治工作和思想教育工作。同时，在合作化之后，也就更需要党加强对合作社的领导，因为：在个体经济时代，农民的生产和生活是由他们自己负责安排的，在合作化之后，领导生产的责任重心就转移到合作社方面来了。为了使社干部真正负起这种责任，不辜负农民对它的希望，就需要党从政治、经济、组织等各方面去帮助合作社。应该了解：农民虽然已经参加了合作社，但是他们原来的思想观点和传统习惯在短时期内还不可能完全改变过来，为使这些思想观点和传统习惯不致损害集体事业，党就必须继续加强对他们的思想教育工作。特别要加强对干部和党员的思想教育，防止一切可能产生的贪污腐化和脱离群众的现象。为此，各级党委，还必须按照七届六中全会的精神，继续加强对合作社的领导工作；尤其要加强基层党的组织工作，使支部真正成为领导合作社与团结广大社员的核心。目前有些地区由于撤区并乡，干部层层上调，削弱支部领导的现象必须加以克服。应该善于利用合作社这所社会主义的学校，从农民日常生产和生活中加强对农民的社会主义与集体主义教育，使农民从政治上、经济上和思想上进一步巩固同工人阶级的联盟，在党和工人阶级的领导下，胜利前进。
