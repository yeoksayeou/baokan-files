    Since the beginning of this year, the transportation situation in Sichuan Province has been very tense. Initially, it was more prominent on the Sichuan-Tibet and Sichuan-Shaanxi routes. Since June, it has formed an unprecedented comprehensive tension. Whether it is from outside the province or inside, long-distance or short-distance transportation, and urban handling, the contradiction between transportation volume and transportation capacity is very prominent, and serious congestion and backlog of passenger and freight transportation have occurred. In August, the materials backlog in Yichang, Hubei, and Baoji, Shaanxi, reached more than 30,000 tons; the materials backlog at various ports in Sichuan Province also amounted to tens of thousands of tons. In Chongqing and Chengdu, due to insufficient handling and loading and unloading capacity, a large number of materials were also backlog at stations and docks. In Chengdu, only 42% of the materials backlog in July and August were loaded, unloaded, and transported away.
    The massive congestion and backlog of various materials have seriously affected Sichuan Province's industrial and agricultural production and people's lives. Many factories and mines have been unable to complete their national plans due to the inability to transport raw materials in and products out. The thousands of tons of pig iron and ore backlog in Yichang directly threatened the open-hearth steelmaking of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company, and 12,000 tons of various steels produced in Chongqing could not be shipped out in time, affecting the steel supply of dozens of factories and mines across the country. Some basic construction projects have also been suspended and waiting for materials due to the inability to transport materials in time, delaying the progress of the projects. More than 59,000 sprayers transported to Baoji have been backlog since June, preventing millions of mu of cotton fields in the province from being treated for pests in a timely manner. Due to the inability to supply various seasonal commodities in time, commodity shortages have occurred in the vast urban and rural markets. In Chongqing, Chengdu, Zigong, Wanxian, Fuling, and other cities, more than 2,000 kinds of cotton cloth, general merchandise, cultural supplies, and hardware equipment were out of stock. Under the tense transportation situation, hundreds and thousands of passengers were stranded on their journeys, and more than 20,000 students could not arrive at school on time. Some schools have started, but a large number of textbooks and lecture notes have not been transported from other places in time, which has affected the teaching plan.
    Why is the transportation in Sichuan Province particularly tense this year? The most fundamental reason is that, under the comprehensive high tide of the national economy, the transportation volume has increased sharply compared with previous years, but the transportation capacity has not adapted to this new situation and has not increased accordingly in a planned and proportional manner, which has led to an imbalance between social transportation volume and transportation capacity. In addition, the flood season came earlier this year, and the road damage was more serious, and the Baoji-Chengdu Railway failed to open to traffic as scheduled... The contradiction between transportation volume and transportation capacity became more acute. In August this year, the province's automobile freight volume reached more than 236,000 tons, an increase of nearly two times compared with the average monthly transportation volume in 1955; the monthly volume of goods transported from Yichang in the second quarter reached 100,000 to 120,000 tons, an increase of 70% to 100% compared with the average monthly volume last year; this year, the materials supporting the construction of Tibet increased more than twenty times compared with last year. However, the province's transportation capacity has not increased, but has decreased compared with last year. According to the current transportation volume, the province is still short of more than 2,000 automobiles.
    The transportation potential of existing vehicles has not been fully utilized. In addition to being sent to factories for repairs and the lack of drivers, 200 automobiles and 7,000 carts in the province cannot participate in transportation due to insufficient fuel and accessories. The automobiles currently participating in transportation also waste three or four hours of transportation time every day due to the mechanical working hours and complicated procedures of many freight units. In this way, Chengdu Railway Station alone wastes more than 3,000 ton-kilometers of automobile transportation capacity every day. Many units do not handle transportation procedures on Sundays, and most automobiles have not implemented a two-shift system, resulting in a great waste of transportation capacity. In addition, due to insufficient maintenance work and a lack of repair technicians, 23% of the automobiles in the province are often parked in factories for repairs, and Chengdu Transportation Company often provides only 60% of the good vehicles.
    The failure to fully utilize the civilian transportation force is also one of the reasons for the transportation tension. The chicken carts in western Sichuan, the yaks on the Sichuan-Tibet Plateau, the packhorses in northern and southern Sichuan, and the manual carrying in mountainous areas have been important transportation forces for connecting urban and rural material exchanges for many years. However, in recent years, especially after the upsurge of agricultural cooperation, these civilian transportation forces have rarely participated in transportation due to various restrictions. In the past, the three sulfur mines and Xihe Coal Mine in Fengjie County, eastern Sichuan, mainly relied on the surplus labor force in local rural areas to transport products; this year, due to the restrictions on farmers participating in sideline transportation by agricultural cooperatives, more than 2,000 tons of products from the four mines have been forced to be backlog and cannot be transported out. In fact, there is a surplus of labor in rural areas. According to the investigation by the working group of the Fengjie County Committee of the Communist Party of China, there are 95 surplus laborers in only three agricultural cooperatives such as Paizhuang, who can be drawn out to participate in factory and mine transportation regularly.
    Doing a good job in transportation is the central issue for invigorating Sichuan's national economic life. In order to quickly change the tense situation of transportation, the State Council and the Sichuan Provincial People's Committee are actively taking various emergency measures to mobilize all possible transportation forces to rush to transport materials inside and outside the province. At present, they are working in five areas.
    1. Strengthen the transportation capacity of the Yangtze River in Sichuan. The People's Navy has drawn out five large and medium-sized landing craft to support the Yangtze River in Sichuan to rush to transport work. Chongqing Shipping Administration has also transferred six fleets to concentrate its efforts on transferring materials entering Sichuan. The shipping department has also actively promoted the method of transporting long and heavy steel parts by rail barges to tap the transportation potential of barges.
    2. Concentrate the main automobile force and make a breakthrough in trunk line transportation. In the past, due to the fact that many automobiles were scattered on various branch lines, the automobile transportation force on the trunk line was weakened. In order to change this situation of "dividing troops to guard the passes," more than 1,100 automobiles have now been drawn from various places and concentrated on the Sichuan-Shaanxi, Sichuan-Tibet, and Sichuan-Yunnan highways to first rush to transport gasoline, daily necessities, and materials supporting Tibet and Liangshan, which are closely related to production and people's lives. In addition to transferring a part of the materials urgently needed to be transported from Baoji from the north and south sections of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, the province has also concentrated 350 automobiles to rush to transport them, and it is expected that 10,000 tons of materials can be transported in August and September. The 100 automobiles sent by the Chengdu Military Region of the People's Liberation Army have also participated in the rush to transport.
    3. Organize the civilian transportation force. Wenjiang Prefecture mobilized 10,000 human-powered chicken carts to transport grain, and quickly completed the task of transporting 9,100 tons of grain for disaster relief. In order to develop mass transportation, the province plans to develop a large number of horse-drawn carts, carts, and flatbed trucks, and allocate 150 tons of steel and a large number of rubber strips to manufacture human-powered freight vehicles.
    4. Make full use of wooden boats to develop inland river shipping. Sichuan has a dense river network, and more than 90 of the province's 192 counties have access to wooden boats, of which long-distance wooden boats alone reach 300,000 tons. However, wooden boats have not been fully utilized in some areas. For example, Dazhou County currently has more than 10,000 tons of wooden boat transportation capacity. If the 4,000 tons of wheat seeds originally transported by automobiles in Dazhou and Qu County are changed to be transported by wooden boats, it can not only overcome the surplus of wooden boat transportation capacity, but also transfer automobiles to places in urgent need.
    5. Strengthen transportation scheduling and organization work, improve loading and unloading operations, increase the automobile load factor, and give full play to the efficiency of self-owned trucks of organs and enterprises. After Chengdu Transportation Company implemented a day and night two-shift system, one vehicle can exert the effect of 1.7 vehicles. The 30 automobiles of various organs participating in transportation in Chengdu can complete a transportation task of 540,000 ton-kilometers in the fourth quarter alone.
    Although the above measures can solve most of the current transportation tension, the overall situation in the province is still insufficient transportation capacity. Especially after a large number of basic construction projects start next year, the volume of material transportation will inevitably increase sharply, and the tense situation of insufficient transportation capacity will become more prominent. For long-term consideration, the relevant authorities should also find ways to purchase various transportation tools as soon as possible and improve the loading and unloading equipment at stations and ports. Various prefectures and autonomous prefectures should also establish transportation management agencies and develop transportation tools suitable for local roads.

    四川积极解决运输堵塞问题
    本报记者  纪希晨
    今年以来，四川省的交通运输情况很紧张。最初，只在川藏、川陕两条路线上比较突出，从6月以来，就形成了历年未有的全面紧张。无论省外进出方面，省内长短途运输和城市搬运方面，运输量大于运输力的矛盾都十分突出，客货运输发生了严重的阻塞和积压现象。8月份，积压在湖北宜昌和陕西宝鸡两地的入川物资即达三万多吨；四川省内各口岸积压的物资也有好几万吨。重庆、成都两地因为搬运装卸力量不足，也有大批物资积压在车站、码头上。成都市七、八月份积压的物资，只装卸运走了42％。
    各种物资的大量阻塞和积压，严重影响了四川省的工农业生产和人民的生活。不少厂矿企业由于原料运不进来，产品运不出去，完不成国家计划。积压在宜昌的数千吨生铁、矿砂，直接使重庆钢铁公司的平炉炼钢受到威胁，重庆出产的各种钢材一万二千吨，也由于不能及时外运，影响了全国数十个厂矿的钢材供应。一些基本建设工程也因为材料不能及时运到，停工待料，延迟了工程进度。运到宝鸡的五万九千多部喷雾器，从6月一直积压到现在，使全省几百万亩棉田不能适时除治害虫。由于各种时令商品不能及时供应，广大城乡市场发生了商品脱销的现象。重庆、成都、自贡、万县、涪陵等城市，脱销的棉布、百货、文化用品和五金器材等达二千多种。在运输紧张的情况下，成百成千的旅客被阻在旅途中，两万多学生不能如期到校。有的学校虽然开学了，可是大批课本、讲义没有及时从外地运到，使教学计划受到了影响。
    今年四川省的交通运输为什么会特别紧张呢？最根本的原因，是在国民经济全面高涨的情况下，运输量比往年急剧增长，但是交通运输力量却没有适应这种新形势，有计划按比例地相应增长，这就使社会运输量和运输力之间失去了平衡。加以今年洪水期提前，道路损坏的情况比较严重，宝成铁路未能如期通车营业……运输量和运输力之间的矛盾便更加尖锐化。今年8月，全省汽车货运物资达二十三万六千多吨，比1955年每月平均运量增加将近两倍；第二季度由宜昌上运物资每月达十万到十二万吨，比去年每月平均增长70％到100％；今年支援西藏建设的物资比去年增加了二十倍以上。但是，全省的运输力量不但没有增长，反而比去年减少了。按照目前的运输量计算，全省尚缺两千多部汽车。
    现有车辆的运输潜力也没有充分发挥。除了因为进厂修理和缺乏司机外，仅因油料和配件不够，全省就有二百辆汽车和七千辆架子车不能参加运输。现在参加运输的汽车，也因许多运货单位工作时间机械，手续繁杂，每天有三、四小时不能运输。这样，仅成都火车站每天就浪费三千多吨公里的汽车运力。许多单位星期天不办理运输手续，绝大部分汽车还都没有实行两班制，运输力浪费很大。另外，由于保修工作做得不够，缺乏修理技术人员，全省有23％的汽车经常停在厂里修理，成都运输公司经常提供的完好车辆只有60％。
    民间运输力没有充分利用，也是造成运输紧张的原因之一。川西的鸡公车，川康高原的牦牛，川北、川南的驮马，高山地区的人挑人背，多年来，一直是沟通城乡物资交流的重要运输力量。可是近年来，特别是农业合作化高潮到来以后，这些民间运输力量由于种种限制，就很少参加运输了。往年川东奉节县三个硫磺矿和翕合煤矿，主要靠当地农村剩余劳动力运输产品；今年由于农业合作社限制农民参加搬运副业，四个矿有两千多吨产品被迫积压起来，无法外运。实际上，农村的劳动力是有剩余的，据中共奉节县委工作组调查，仅拍庄等三个农业合作社就有九十五个剩余劳动力，可以抽出经常参加厂矿运输。
    搞好交通运输是当前活跃四川国民经济生活的中心问题。为着迅速改变交通运输的紧张情况，国务院和四川省人民委员会正在积极采取各种紧急措施，动员一切可以动员的运输力量，抢运省内外的物资。目前，他们正从五方面进行工作。
    一、加强川江的运输力量。人民海军已经抽出五艘大、中型登陆艇，支援川江抢运工作。重庆航运管理局也抽调了六个船队，集中力量转运进川的物资。航运部门还积极推行铁驳装运长重钢件法，挖掘驳船运输潜力。
    二、集中汽车主力，突击干线运输。过去由于许多汽车分散在各条支线上，干线汽车运输力量便被削弱了。为了改变这种“分兵把口”的情况，现在已经从各地抽出一千一百多辆汽车，集中到川陕、川藏、川滇公路上，首先抢运同生产和人民生活关系密切的汽油、日用品和支援西藏、凉山的物资。从宝鸡急待运进的物资，除从宝成铁路南北段转运一部分外，全省还集中了三百五十辆汽车进行抢运，预计八、九两月可争取运进一万吨物资。人民解放军成都军区派出支援的一百部汽车也参加了抢运。
    三、组织民间运输力量。温江专区动员一万部人力鸡公车运粮，很快就完成了运粮九千一百吨的救灾任务。为了发展群众运输，全省计划发展大批马车、架子车、板车，并且拨出一百五十吨钢材和大批胶条，制造人力货车。
    四、充分利用木船，发展内河航运。四川河网密布，全省一百九十二个县就有九十多个县通航木船，其中仅长航木船即达三十万吨。但是，有些地区木船没有充分利用。例如达县，现有一万多吨木船运力。如将达县、渠县原交汽车运输的四千吨麦种，改由木船运输，既可克服木船运力的剩余现象，又可以把汽车抽调到急需的地方去。
    五、加强运输调度组织工作，改进装卸作业，提高汽车载重率，发挥机关企业自用货车的效率。成都运输公司推行日夜双班制以后，一辆车可以发挥一点七辆车的效力。各机关参加成都市内运输的三十辆汽车，仅第四季度就可以完成五十四万吨公里的运输任务。
    采取以上措施，虽然可以解决当前运输紧张的大部分问题，但是全省总的情况还是运输力不足。特别是明年基本建设工程大量开工以后，物资运输量必将激增，运力不足的紧张情况将会更加突出。为了长远打算，有关机关还应该尽早设法，增购各种运输工具，改善车站、港口装卸设备。各专区、自治州也应该建立运输管理机构，发展适合于当地道路的运输工具。
