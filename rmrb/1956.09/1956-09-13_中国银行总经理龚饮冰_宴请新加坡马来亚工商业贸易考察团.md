Xinhua News Agency, 12th: Gong Yinbing, General Manager of the Bank of China, hosted a banquet at the Overseas Chinese Hotel tonight for all members of the Singapore Industrial and Commercial Trade Delegation and the Federation of Malaya Industrial and Commercial Trade Delegation.

The host of the banquet, Gong Yinbing, said in his speech: "On behalf of the Bank of China, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to all the gentlemen of the two delegations from Singapore and the Federation of Malaya, and through the delegations, I would like to express my gratitude to people from all walks of life in Singapore and the Federation of Malaya who care for and help the Bank of China." He said that China and Singapore and the Federation of Malaya have a long and traditional trade relationship. The Bank of China has established branches and sub-branches in Singapore, Kuala Lumpur and Penang. After the liberation of China, the business of these branches has developed rapidly, which is inseparable from the care, help and support of people from all walks of life in Singapore and the Federation of Malaya for the Bank of China.

Goh Teck Phuat, head of the Singapore Industrial and Commercial Trade Delegation, and Li Yannian, head of the Federation of Malaya Industrial and Commercial Trade Delegation, both expressed their deep gratitude to the host of the banquet. Goh Teck Phuat said that this trade negotiation has opened up new trade routes for Singapore and Malaya. So far, the trade negotiations have achieved initial success. Rubber is the lifeline of Singapore and Malaya, and it would be a great loss to us if we did not sell it to China. Today is the first time in five years since the lifting of the embargo that a contract has been signed with China, and all members of the delegation are very excited.

Among those invited to attend were Chen Shutong, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, Sha Qianli, Secretary-General, Cao Juru, President of the People's Bank of China, and more than 180 people in total.

    中国银行总经理龚饮冰
    宴请新加坡马来亚工商业贸易考察团
    新华社12日讯　中国银行总经理龚饮冰，今晚在新侨饭店宴请新加坡工商业贸易考察团和马来亚联合邦工商业贸易考察团全体人员。
    宴会主人龚饮冰致词说：“我代表中国银行向新加坡、马来亚联合邦两个考察团的诸位先生表示衷心的感谢，并且通过考察团，向新加坡和马来亚联合邦关心和帮助中国银行的各界人士表示感谢。”他说，中国和新加坡、马来亚联合邦有着悠久传统的贸易关系。中国银行曾在新加坡、吉隆坡和槟榔屿设立了分行、支行。中国解放后，这些分支行的业务，都得到迅速发展，这是同新加坡、马来亚联合邦的各界人士对中国银行的关心、帮助和支持分不开的。
    新加坡工商业贸易考察团团长高德根和马来亚联合邦工商业贸易考察团团长李延年都向宴会主人表示深切的感谢。高德根说，这次的贸易会谈为新加坡和马来亚开辟了贸易的新路线。到今天为止，贸易会谈已获得了初步的成功。树胶是新加坡和马来亚的生命线，如果不卖给中国对我们损失很大。今天是五年来禁运解除后第一次和中国签订了合同，全体团员都非常兴奋。
    应邀出席作陪的，有中华全国工商业联合会主任委员陈叔通、秘书长沙千里，中国人民银行行长曹菊如等共一百八十多人。
