    Studying Lu Xun, Learning from Lu Xun
    — Opening Speech at the Commemorative Meeting for the Twentieth Anniversary of Lu Xun's Death
    Mao Dun
    October 19th this year marks the twentieth anniversary of Mr. Lu Xun's death, and there will be a grand commemoration at that time. To coincide with this commemoration, the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles is specially holding several mass report meetings, with different people invited to give lectures. Today is the first one. We hope that these report meetings will be helpful for studying Lu Xun and learning from Lu Xun.
    Speaking of studying Lu Xun, we will think of a number of research works on Lu Xun. These works each have their strengths and weaknesses, but we believe that the atmosphere of research should be as strong as possible. We must launch a free discussion of "Letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," so that we can further deepen the research work. It is neither appropriate nor possible to hastily demand a conclusion. Lu Xun's writings during his lifetime are not only numerous, but also cover a wide range. No individual (so far) can conduct a comprehensive study of Lu Xun. It is necessary for experts in various fields to cooperate and divide the work in order to do this work well.
    Speaking of learning from Lu Xun, frankly speaking, we should admit that our learning is not very good. To give one example: On the one hand, Lu Xun advocated that the task of literature and art is to "change people's spirits," but at the same time, he also emphasized that literary and artistic works must first be literature and art, and carry out ideological education through artistic images. At that time, he opposed dry sermons and opposed sticking a bright tail on works; that is to say, he opposed formalism and conceptualization. In March 1930, when he spoke at the founding meeting of the League of Left-Wing Writers, he pointed out that writers must come into contact with the actual social struggle. It is not feasible to simply stay in a glass window to write articles and study problems. He pointed out that revolutionary writers must at least share life with the revolution or deeply feel the pulse of the revolution. He said this more than twenty years ago, but we still have to vigorously overcome the formalism and conceptualization of works today, which shows that our learning is not good enough.
    To give another example. Lu Xun emphasized learning from foreign advanced literature, art, and scholarship, but he also emphasized that learning from foreign countries is not about swallowing everything whole, not about abandoning oneself to follow others, but about melting and absorbing them to enrich and improve oneself. He opposed wholesale Westernization and also opposed ideological and academic isolationism. He repeatedly elaborated on this view in his essays. This was also more than twenty years ago. But it seems that we have not learned this very well either, to the extent that there are still deviations and disputes in various practical issues in the literary and art departments today.
    Finally, I plan to say one more thing. Lu Xun was the first to notice the necessity of ideological remolding for literary and art workers, and he recognized the long-term and arduous nature of ideological remolding. He ridiculed some intellectuals at the time who had only read a few books on Marxism-Leninism and thought that their ideology had become 100% proletarian. He warned that such "suddenly changed" "heroes" could not stand the test. He taught us that we must temper ourselves in struggle and gradually complete the real ideological remolding. He himself often said, "Old habits are hard to forget." He strictly demanded himself, saying: I often dissect others, but I dissect myself even more often and more ruthlessly. I am afraid that we have not learned this spirit completely or well either?
    Today's admission ticket for the report meeting is printed with a quote from Lu Xun: "The light of the future will prove that we are not only preservers of literary and artistic heritage, but also pioneers and builders." The "light of the future" that Lu Xun spoke of at that time is now a reality. Please allow me to use Lu Xun's words to congratulate all comrades present here on greater and more successes in their work, and to be pioneers and builders in the new era of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend!

    研究鲁迅，学习鲁迅
    ——鲁迅逝世二十周年纪念报告会开幕词
    茅盾
    今年10月19日是鲁迅先生逝世二十周年，届时将有盛大的纪念；为了配合这个纪念，中国文联特地举办几次群众性的报告会，分别请人主讲，今天是第一次。我们盼望：这些报告会对于研究鲁迅和学习鲁迅，将有所帮助。
    讲到研究鲁迅，我们就会想到若干对于鲁迅的研究著作。这些著作各有短长，然而我们以为研究空气总是愈浓愈好；必须展开“百家争鸣”的自由讨论，然后能够把研究工作进一步深入。性急地要求定论，是不适宜的，也是不可能的。鲁迅生平的著作，不但数量多，而涉及的范围也很广博，任何个人（到现在为止）还不可能对鲁迅作全面的研究，须要各方面的专家，分工合作，才能把这工作做好。
    再讲到学习鲁迅，坦白地说，我们应当承认，我们的学习是并不太好的。试举一事为例：鲁迅一方面主张文艺的任务是在于“改变人的精神”，但同时他也强调文艺作品必须首先是文艺，通过艺术形象来进行思想教育。他在当时就反对干巴巴的说教，反对在作品上硬扎一条光明的尾巴；也就是说，他反对公式化概念化。1930年3月，他在左翼作家联盟成立大会上讲了话，他就指出：作家必须和实际的社会斗争接触。单关在玻璃窗内做文章、研究问题，那是不行的。他指出：革命文学家至少是必须和革命共同着生命，或深切地感受着革命的脉搏。他说这番话，在二十多年前，可是我们至今还不断地要大力克服作品的公式化、概念化，可见我们的学习是不够好的。
    再举一事。鲁迅强调学习外国的先进的文艺和学术，但也强调指出，学习外国，不是生吞活剥，不是舍己从人，而是要溶化吸收，来丰富自己，提高自己。他反对全盘欧化，也反对思想上学术上的闭关主义。他这主张，在他的杂文中曾经反复加以申论。这也是二十多年前的事了。可是在这一点上，好像我们也并没学习得很好，以至今天还在文艺部门的各种实际问题上发生了偏差和争论。
    最后，我打算再说一点，鲁迅是最早注意到文艺工作者思想改造的必要，而且认识到思想改造的长期性和艰苦性的。他嘲笑了当时的一些仅仅读了几本马克思列宁主义的书籍，就自以为自己的思想意识已经是百分之百无产阶级化了的知识分子。他提出警告道：这样，“突变”了的“英雄”是经不起考验的。他教导我们：必须在斗争中锻炼自己，逐渐完成真正的思想改造。他自己常说“积习难忘”；他严格地要求自己，他说：我经常地解剖别人，但更经常更无情地解剖自己。他这种精神，恐怕我们也未见得学得全，学得好罢？
    今天的报告会的入场证上印着鲁迅的一句话：“将来的光明，必将证明我们不但是文艺上的遗产的保存者，而且也是开拓者和建设者”。鲁迅在那时所说的“将来的光明”，在今天已是现实。请容许我用鲁迅这句话来祝贺今天在座各位同志工作上更大更多的成功，在百花齐放、百家争鸣的新时代作开拓者和建设者！　（9月16日北京）
