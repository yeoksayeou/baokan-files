Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 15th. Party leadership organs at all levels in Gansu Province are gradually establishing a working style of going deep into the masses and deep into reality to conduct investigation and research.

Since the Second Congress of the Communist Party of China Gansu Provincial Committee in late June, party leadership organs at all levels have taken strengthening investigation and research as a major measure to improve leadership style, in accordance with the spirit of the congress's resolutions. The CPC Gansu Provincial Committee and its subordinate departments have successively dispatched dozens of professional work groups related to industry, transportation, construction, agriculture, commerce, handicrafts, and ethnic groups to conduct special investigations and research in key areas, and are starting to comprehensively arrange work. Local committees have organized more than a dozen various professional work groups with major leading cadres participating, to go deep into districts, townships, or agricultural production cooperatives. Through investigation and research, they are resolving practical problems existing in current work. After earnestly examining the leadership style of the county committee, the CPC Zhang County Committee stipulated that the county committee members should spend most of their time going deep into the masses. In the past two months, fourteen of the fifteen members of the CPC Zhang County Committee have adopted the method of "on-site office work," going deep into townships and agricultural cooperatives, greatly changing the previous style of working in the county office, holding meetings, and issuing instructions without in-depth understanding.

In order to change the previous shortcomings of the party's leading organs, such as holding meetings and issuing documents and instructions without investigation and research, the party organizations at all levels in Gansu Province have generally conducted investigations and research beforehand when convening meetings and issuing documents and instructions recently. After discovering that some areas had a tendency to blindly adopt advanced experiences from other places without considering local conditions in promoting agricultural production increase, the Rural Work Department of the CPC Gansu Provincial Committee specifically organized a work group to investigate the serious situation of grain production reduction caused by the blind adoption of experiences from other places in changing summer fields to autumn fields and irrigating spring water in Majiasiang Township, Yuzhong County, thereby correctly guiding various localities to correct and prevent the tendency of blindly adopting advanced experiences. In the past, party organizations in some mountainous areas were often unable to make demands according to the characteristics of the mountainous areas when deploying work because they were unaware of the situation. Recently, these areas have also planned to send a large number of cadres to conduct key investigations in mountainous areas to listen to the opinions and demands of the people in mountainous areas. Based on the results of investigations and research on the mountainous economy, the CPC Pingliang Prefectural Committee recently required all counties to establish Mountainous Production Planning Offices, and to propose specific measures and long-term plans to improve the lives of people in mountainous areas through key investigations and research in mountainous townships. The cadres and masses of Yongning County were recently worried about the lack of fertilizer sources for next year. The CPC Yongning County Committee sent cadres to the masses to understand the sources of fertilizer and the situation of accumulating fertilizer, and found that there were still many sources of fertilizer in rural areas. Subsequently, based on this investigation, the county party committee studied the issue of fertilizer accumulation throughout the county at a meeting of township party secretaries and township heads, and timely found a solution to the fertilizer needed for the whole county next year.

Xinhua News Agency, Jiamusi, 16th. The CPC Jiamusi Municipal Committee took the lead in changing the leadership style, promoting leading cadres of major factories and construction sites in the city to go deep into reality, and improving the level of enterprise management.

In the past, responsible cadres of the CPC Jiamusi Municipal Committee went to factories and construction sites in person to understand and study the situation less often, but held meetings upstairs to listen to reports, learn about the situation, and make resolutions more often. Therefore, they did not have a deep understanding of the city's advanced producer movement and the situation of major factories and construction sites. The secretary of the CPC Jiamusi Municipal Committee, who was responsible for contacting the key project—Jiamusi Comprehensive Paper Mill, only went to the construction site once a month on average due to the large number of daily meetings and affairs.

In early September, the municipal party committee held an enlarged meeting, earnestly examined and made a resolution to change the leadership style. In addition to the municipal party committee secretary-general being responsible for handling daily affairs, the municipal party committee secretaries and municipal party committee members responsible for industry, infrastructure construction, finance and trade and other departments all extracted half of their working time to go deep into major factories and construction sites to conduct research and inspection, and timely helped enterprises improve their leadership level.

Under the supervision and inspection of the municipal party committee, the leading cadres of major factories and construction sites quickly changed their leadership style. From January to June, Jiamusi Textile Factory exceeded the state-stipulated raw cotton consumption target every month. Workshop cadres reported to the factory that it was caused by the poor quality of raw cotton, and the factory leaders echoed the claim without in-depth inspection. Now, after conducting in-depth inspection, it was found that it was not due to the low quality of raw cotton, but due to poor production management, uneven yarn thickness, and uneven mixing of good and inferior cotton. Recently, the leading cadres of this factory personally organized the promotion of advanced experiences such as the return twisting knot method, which increased the quantity of first-grade yarn in the factory from 56.6% to 90.86%. In the past, the leading cadres of Jiamusi Sugar Factory were accustomed to solving problems with meetings. There were many meetings, but the effect was not great. The leading cadres were exhausted from the meetings and relaxed the specific leadership of the factory. Since September, the factory has reduced two-thirds of the meetings, and the meetings that must be held are prepared in advance. Now, the leading cadres of the factory have time to study and research the instructions from superiors, and have gone deep into the site to timely discover and solve more than 100 problems related to factory production, expansion, and workers' lives, which has been praised by the workers. For example, the scrap rate of castings in the machine repair workshop of this factory reached 50%, and the workshop cadres believed it was an insurmountable problem. After the factory leaders discovered this problem, they specifically organized workers to learn from the casting experience of Jiamusi Electric Motor Factory, so that the scrap rate of castings was reduced by half compared to the past.

    甘肃省各级党组织改进领导作风
    中共佳木斯市委改进工作作风带动各企业提高领导水平
    新华社兰州15日电　甘肃省各级党的领导机关正逐渐树立起深入群众，深入实际的调查研究的工作作风。
    从今年6月底举行的中共甘肃省第二次代表大会以后，各级党的领导机关都根据党代会的决议精神把加强调查研究工作作为改进领导作风的主要措施。中共甘肃省委员会及所属各部已经先后派出数十个有关工业、交通、建筑、农业、商业、手工业、民族等方面的专业工作组，分别深入到各重点地区进行专题调查研究，着手全面安排工作。各地委会都组织了十几个有主要领导干部参加的各种专业工作组，深入到区、乡或农业生产合作社，通过调查研究，解决目前工作中存在的实际问题。各县委会在认真检查了县委会的领导作风以后，规定县委会的委员要以大部分时间深入到群众中去。中共漳县县委会十五个委员中有十四人在最近两个月内采取了“到现场办公”的办法，深入到乡和农业社去，大大改变了以往忙于在县里坐办公室、开会、发指示的不深入的工作作风。
    为了改变以往党的领导机关缺乏调查研究便召开会议和发公文指示的缺点，最近甘肃省的各级党组织一般在召开会议和发公文指示时，事先都进行了调查研究。中共甘肃省委农村工作部最近发现有些地区在推广农业增产经验中发生了不根据当地具体条件盲目搬用别地先进经验的偏向以后，便专门组织了一个工作组，调查了?兰县麻家寺乡在把夏田改种秋田和涝灌春水
  中盲目搬用别地经验而造成粮食减产的严重情况，从而正确地指导各地纠正和防止盲目搬用先进经验的偏向。有些山区的党组织，过去在布置工作的时候，因为心中无数，往往不能根据山区的特点提出要求，最近这些地区也有计划地抽出大批干部深入山区重点调查，听取山区人民的意见和要求。中共平凉地委会最近根据对山区经济进行调查研究的结果，要求各县成立山区生产规划办公室，通过对山区乡的重点调查研究，提出目前改善山区人民生活的具体措施和长远规划。永宁县的干部和群众最近为明年的肥料没有来源发愁，中共永宁县委会就派干部深入到群众中去了解肥源和积肥情况，发现农村中肥源仍然很多，随后根据这一调查，在乡支书、乡长会议上研究了全县积肥问题，及时找出了解决明年全县所需肥料的办法。
    新华社佳木斯16日电　中共佳木斯市委员会带头转变领导作风，推动了全市主要工厂、工地的领导干部深入实际，提高了企业管理水平。
    过去，中共佳木斯市委的负责干部亲自下工厂、工地了解研究情况少，而在上边开会听汇报，兜情况、作决议多。因此对全市的先进生产者运动和主要工厂、工地的情况都了解得不够深透。负责联系重点工程——佳木斯综合造纸厂的中共佳木斯市委书记，由于日常会议和事务繁多，平均每月只到工地去一次。
    9月初，市委召开了扩大会议，
  认真检查和作出了转变领导作风的决议，除市委秘书长负责处理日常事务外，分工负责工业、基建、财贸等部门的市委书记和市委委员都抽出一半的工作时间深入主要工厂、工地进行研究和检查，及时帮助企业提高领导水平。
    各主要工厂、工地的领导干部在市委的督促和检查下，迅速地转变了他们的领导作风。佳木斯纺织厂一月到六月份月月超过国家规定的原棉消耗指标，车间干部向工厂反映是原棉质量不好而造成的，工厂的领导不深入检查也随声附和。现在进行深入检查，发现并不是原棉质量低，却是由于生产管理不善，纺出的线粗细不一，好次棉又搭配不匀。这个厂的领导干部最近亲自组织推广了回捻结头法等先进经验，使全厂纱的一级品数量从56.6％提高到90.86％。佳木斯糖厂的领导干部过去惯于用会议解决问题，会议很多，效果不大，领导干部疲于开会，放松了工厂的具体领导。9月份以来，这个厂减去了三分之二的会议，必须召开的会，都在事先做好准备工作。现在，这个厂的领导干部有时间学习研究上级的指示文件，并深入现场及时发现和解决了一百多项有关工厂生产、扩建和工人生活方面的问题，受到了职工们的赞扬。如这个厂机修车间的铸件废品率达到50％，车间干部认为是不可克服的问题，工厂领导发现了这个问题以后，具体组织职工学习佳木斯电机厂铸工方面的经验，使铸件的废品率比过去降低了一半。
