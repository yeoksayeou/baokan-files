World Science and Technology Briefs
	Jet Helicopter
	A Dutch company has trial-produced a helicopter with jet engines at the tips of its two blades. This helicopter, called "Kolibrie," weighs two hundred kilograms and costs two-thirds less to manufacture than a regular helicopter of the same horsepower. It can carry two people and some cargo for a short distance at a speed of 100 kilometers per hour.
	West Germany has manufactured another helicopter called "Libera." It has three blades with jet engines, and its frame is made of bamboo. The aircraft weighs only fifty kilograms and can fly at a maximum speed of 105 kilometers per hour.
	Glass Steel
	Soviet scientists Brov and Andreyevskaya have recently invented a "glass steel" made of fiberglass and synthetic resin. This new material has the properties of steel and is also elastic. It can be used to manufacture the outer shells of trains, automobiles, and light boats, oil pipes, and prefabricated house components, furniture, suitcases, and other utensils, as reinforcement for high-strength concrete, and as a high-voltage insulating material.
	The raw materials for manufacturing glass steel are sand, rock, clay, and various silicate compounds. The Soviet Union has planned to mass-produce this new product.
	Jointless Railway
	After more than a year of testing, the Czechoslovakian railway department is now laying jointless railways on railway lines throughout the country. These jointless railways have shown in winter and summer tests that the length of the rails does not change regardless of temperature variations.
	The process of laying this type of railway is as follows: first, the rails are welded into 50-meter-long sections at the installation station, then the rails are nailed to high-quality concrete sleepers and welded together again at a specific temperature. A special rubber pad is placed between the rails and the sleepers to reduce the impact of the vehicles on the gauge.
	"Flying Train"
	A light and fast "flying train" is now running on American railways. This train is powered by a diesel locomotive and made of light alloy, making it several times lighter than ordinary trains.
	Another characteristic of this train is its low center of gravity, allowing it to maintain its speed almost without reduction when turning. Its average speed exceeds 160 kilometers per hour. (Xinhua News Agency)

    世界科学技术简讯
      喷气直升飞机
    荷兰试制了一种直升飞机，它的两个桨叶的末端装有喷气发动机。这种称为“科利布里”的直升飞机重两百公斤，造价比普通同样马力的直升飞机低三分之二。它能够以每小时一百公里的速度载两个人和一些货物飞一段不长的距离。
    西德制造了另一种叫“利贝拉”的直升飞机。它有三个装有喷气发动机的桨叶，而且它的骨架是用竹子作的，飞机只重五十公斤，最快每小时可以飞行一百零五公里。
      玻　璃　钢
    苏联科学家布罗夫和安德列耶夫斯卡娅最近发明了一种用玻璃丝和合成树脂制成的“玻璃钢”，这种新物质具有钢铁的性质，而且富有弹性，它可以用来制造列车、汽车和轻型船只的外壳、油管和预制房屋的构件，制造家具、皮箱等用具，用作强度混凝土的筋骨，而且还可以当作高压绝缘材料使用。
    制造玻璃钢的原料是砂、岩石、粘土和各种矽酸盐化合物。苏联已经计划大量生产这种新产品。
    无　轨　缝　铁　路
    捷克斯洛伐克铁道部门经过一年多的试验以后，现在已经在全国各铁路线上铺设无轨缝铁路。这种无轨缝铁路在冬季和夏季的试验中表明，无论温度怎样变化，它的铁轨的长度都不会变化。
    铺设这种铁路的过程是这样的：先在安装站把铁轨焊接成各长五十公尺的铁轨，然后把铁轨钉在优质的混凝土轨枕上，并且在一种特定的温度下再把它们焊接起来。在铁轨和轨枕之间安置一种特制的橡皮垫，以便减少车辆对轨距的影响。
     “飞行列车”
    美国铁路上现在行驶着一种结构轻和速度快的“飞行列车”。这种列车由内燃机车牵引，用轻合金制成，它的重量比一般的火车要轻几倍。
    这种列车的另一个特点是重心低，转弯的时候几乎可以不降低行车的速度。它的平均速度每小时超过一百六十公里。（新华社）
