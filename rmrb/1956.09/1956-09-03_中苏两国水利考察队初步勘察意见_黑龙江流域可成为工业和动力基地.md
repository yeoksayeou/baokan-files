Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 2nd: According to "Labor News," the Sino-Soviet joint water conservancy survey team for the comprehensive utilization of the Heilongjiang River Basin arrived in Khabarovsk on a Chinese ship on August 30.

The survey team traveled more than 3,000 kilometers along the Ergun River and the Heilongjiang River. Based on preliminary survey findings, scientists believe that the Heilongjiang River Basin could become a massive industrial and power base for China and the Soviet Union in the near future.

One of the important tasks of the survey team is to explore the hydro potential for constructing a cascade of hydroelectric power stations on the Ergun River, Shilka River, Zeya River, Bureya River, and Heilongjiang River. Currently, along the areas surveyed by the team, in the Dzhalinda region of the upper reaches of the Heilongjiang River, survey work for a hydropower project has already begun. The first hydroelectric power station and a reservoir in the Heilongjiang cascade will be built here, with a power capacity of one million kilowatts.

Currently, the issue of waterway regulation has been resolved. To eliminate annual flooding, the survey team also studied ways to potentially connect the Heilongjiang River to the Sea of Japan.

The geological team of the survey team conducted investigations in the middle reaches of the Heilongjiang River and the Greater and Lesser Khingan Mountains. According to current estimates, these areas are rich in mineral resources. Identifying wasteland in the Heilongjiang River Basin is also a major task of the survey team, in order to establish new, massive grain bases in the Far East. Scientists will also investigate pastures in Inner Mongolia.

Xinhua News Agency dispatch: According to TASS, experts from two water conservancy design and research institutes in Leningrad and Beijing held a joint meeting in Blagoveshchensk on August 25.

Scientists and engineers from both countries discussed plans for conducting surveys and fieldwork on both sides of the Heilongjiang and Ergun Rivers bordering the two countries. Experts from both countries introduced existing materials on the natural conditions in the upper reaches of the Heilongjiang River, as well as the initial drafts of construction plans. According to this draft, a cascade of hydroelectric power stations will be built in this area, and the huge regulating dams will be able to block 70% of the floods in the upper reaches of the Heilongjiang River, which will greatly reduce flood disasters in the middle and lower reaches of the Heilongjiang River.

The heads of the Chinese and Soviet survey teams reported on the organization and planned workload of the survey teams at the meeting.

    中苏两国水利考察队初步勘察意见
    黑龙江流域可成为工业和动力基地
    新华社莫斯科2日电　据“劳动报”报道：中苏综合利用黑龙江流域水利考察队，乘一只中国轮船在8月30日到达伯力。
    考察队在额尔古纳河和黑龙江行经了三千多公里的路程。根据初步的勘察情况，科学家们认为黑龙江流域在最近的将来就可能成为中苏两国一个巨大的工业和动力基地。
    考察队的重要任务之一，就是勘察在额尔古纳河、西尔卡河、泽雅河、布利雅河和黑龙江这些河流上建设水电站阶梯的水力条件。现在，沿着考察队经过的地方，在黑龙江上游的德热林达地区，水力设计的考察工作已经开始。这里将建立起黑龙江阶梯的第一个水电站和一个水库，这个水电站的电力将达一百万瓩。
    现在，调整水路的问题已经得到解决。为了消灭每年的洪水泛滥，考察队还研究了使黑龙江同日本海可能沟通的办法。
    考察队的地质小组在黑龙江中游、大小兴安岭地区进行了考察。根据目前的推测，这些地区蕴藏有极丰富的矿产。查明黑龙江流域的荒地也是考察队的重大任务，以便在远东建立新的巨大的粮食基地。科学家们还要考察内蒙古的牧场。
    据新华社讯　据塔斯社报道：列宁格勒和北京的两个水利设计勘察研究机关的专家们8月25日在海兰泡举行了联席会议。
    两国的科学家和工程师商讨了在两国交界的黑龙江和额尔古纳河两岸进行勘察和野外工作的计划。两国的专家彼此介绍了关于黑龙江上游地区自然情况的现有材料以及建筑计划草案的初稿。根据这个草案。在这个地区将建筑一个水力发电站阶梯，巨大的调节坝将能够拦阻黑龙江上游的洪水70％，黑龙江中、下游的洪水灾害将大大减轻。
    中国和苏联的考察队队长在会上报告了考察队的组织和预定的工作量。
