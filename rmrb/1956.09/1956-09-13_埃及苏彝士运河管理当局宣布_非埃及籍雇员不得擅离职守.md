Xinhua News Agency, September 12th dispatch from Cairo: The Egyptian Suez Canal Authority condemned the former Suez Canal Company's decision on September 11th to withdraw non-Egyptian staff from the canal, saying the decision has no legal effect.

According to a United Press International correspondent in Cairo, Younis, General Manager of the Egyptian Suez Canal Authority, said on September 11th that the former company "has no authority to issue instructions to anyone."

He added that if foreign employees leave their posts without permission, the Egyptian "judicial authorities will apply the law."

Helmy Bahgat Badawi, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Egyptian Suez Canal Authority, pointed out on the same day that if foreign employees leave their posts without notice or formal permission, it would be equivalent to "sabotage."

Xinhua News Agency, September 12th dispatch from Paris: The former Suez Canal Company, headquartered in Paris, issued a notice letter to non-Egyptian staff of the Suez Canal on September 11th, instructing them to stop working and leave their original positions before September 15th.

The letter stated that the company had asked them to temporarily continue working in their original positions during the London Conference and the "Five-Nation Committee" negotiations in Cairo. Now that the conference and negotiations have ended, the original deadline "has expired," and "all non-Egyptian personnel can stop working on September 14th or 15th, depending on the circumstances."

After the former Suez Canal Company's decision was announced, a British Foreign Office spokesman said that the British government "agrees with the company."

According to the former Suez Canal Company headquarters, the non-Egyptian staff of the canal include 53 French pilots and 61 British pilots. There are a total of 205 pilots working in the canal.

    埃及苏彝士运河管理当局宣布
    非埃及籍雇员不得擅离职守
    新华社12日讯　开罗消息：埃及苏彝士运河管理当局谴责前苏彝士运河公司9月11日关于撤退运河的非埃及工作人员的决定，说这个决定是没有法律效力的。
    据合众社驻开罗记者报道，埃及苏彝士运河管理局总经理尤尼斯9月11日说，前公司“没有权力向任何人发布指示”。
    他又说，如果外国雇员擅离职守，埃及“司法当局将会应用法律”。
    埃及苏彝士运河管理局董事会主席赫勒米·巴哈加特·巴达韦同一天指出说，外国雇员在没有得到通知和正式许可以前就离职的话，就等于进行“怠工”。
    据新华社12日讯　巴黎消息：总部设在巴黎的前苏彝士运河公司9月11日向苏彝士运河的非埃及工作人员发出通知信，指使他们在9月15日以前停止工作，离开原来的职位。
    这封信表示，公司曾经要他们在伦敦会议期间和“五国委员会”在开罗谈判期间暂时在原岗位上继续工作，现在会议和谈判已经结束，原定的期限“已经到期了”，“一切非埃及人员可以根据情况在9月14日或15日停止工作”。
    在前苏彝士运河公司的决定公布以后，英国外交部的一个发言人说，英国政府同公司的“意见一致”。
    据前苏彝士运河公司总部说，运河的非埃及工作人员中包括法籍领航员五十三人和英籍领航员六十一人。在运河工作的领航员一共有二百零五人。
