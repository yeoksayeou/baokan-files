Some Suggestions on Cooperation Between Party Members and Non-Party Members in China
Zhao Zimao, Member of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference

Consolidating and expanding the united front, uniting people from all classes, nationalities, parties, and patriotic individuals from all fields around the Chinese Communist Party, and striving together for socialist construction is a consistent policy of the Chinese Communist Party and an important condition for the success of the Chinese revolution. Recently, the CPC Central Committee and Chairman Mao emphasized the policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" between the Chinese Communist Party and various democratic parties. Minister Li Weihan of the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee further clearly instructed at the Third Session of the First National People's Congress: it is necessary to properly manage the cooperative relationship between Party members and non-Party members in organs, schools, and enterprises. This is truly the most brilliant and greatest policy and measure.

I have worked in a united front organization, the Hebei Provincial Committee of the CPPCC, for many years, and I know how the United Front Work Department of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the CPC correctly and vigorously implements this policy and this principle. On August 4th, it held a symposium on this issue, humbly soliciting everyone's opinions, which is so exciting, pleasant, and admirable! Indeed, this is necessary in order to better tap the potential of non-Party members, to better发挥 the enthusiasm and creativity of non-Party members, and to enable the united front to play the greatest role in the socialist revolution and socialist construction.

The Party (including the Communist Party) will eventually disappear. At that time, "when the skin is gone, what can the hair attach to?" and there will be no so-called "mutual supervision." However, people are becoming increasingly prosperous, developing into "all under heaven are one family," and highly cooperative. Now we are talking about the cooperative relationship between Party members and non-Party members, but in the future, we can say that we will always talk about the cooperative relationship between you and me, this person and that person. So now I will only talk about the cooperative relationship between Party members and non-Party members in organs, schools, and enterprises.

First of all, it must be stated that this issue has gradually been resolved to a considerable extent in recent years, especially in the past year, there has been significant progress. However, in order to seek perfection and to do our best, we must further identify what problems still exist. No matter whether it is an individual or a minor problem, we must seek a thorough solution. So, what problems still exist? According to perhaps incorrect reflections from various sources and my one-sided and immature understanding, there are probably the following situations:

	One, the so-called situation of "having a title but no power." Of course, since there is "no power," there is no public affairs to handle, nothing to do, and naturally there is no good cooperative relationship to speak of. Therefore, this issue is the most attention-grabbing, the most frequently mentioned, and the most focused on resolving by all parties. Two or three months ago, the United Front Work Department of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the CPC and the Hebei Provincial Committee of the CPPCC vigorously resolved the long-standing problem of "having a title but no power" of a non-Party head in a provincial-level organ. Now the cooperative relationship between the Party and non-Party members in this organ is very good. This shows that as long as the parties concerned make efforts, this problem can be solved.

	Two, the so-called situation of "excessive politeness, insufficient criticism and assistance." This means that the Party regards democrats, that is, non-Party members, as people who "enjoy personal pleasures" and "love vanity." However, in the Mao Zedong era of "labor is sacred," "labor is glorious," and everything is for the construction of socialism, everyone will realize that being such a person is the most shameful. If Party members treat non-Party members in this way, non-Party members will naturally feel that you look down on them and shame them. How can they have a good cooperative relationship?! Party members and non-Party members must be frank with each other, express their opinions, and criticize any shortcomings they see. Only in this way can they help each other, and mutual supervision can achieve the goal of unity.

	Three, the situation of "unconscious discrimination." According to the system and regulations, some staff members, including Party members and non-Party members, do not need to participate in discussions or do not need to know about a certain work measure due to the nature or scope of their work (of course, not internal Party matters, let alone Party secrets), which is correct. However, there is often this situation: some Party members participate in discussions or know the details, while non-Party members whose work nature, scope, and positions are equivalent to these Party members do not participate in discussions or know the details, which makes non-Party members feel that they are not valued or even discriminated against on these issues. This makes Party members appear somewhat special on issues that do not belong to the Party at all, which will also affect the cooperative relationship between Party members and non-Party members. Since the issue does not belong to the Party and is not confidential, if Party members are allowed to participate in discussions and know about it, it would be harmless to allow non-Party members to also participate in discussions or know about it. Otherwise, even Party members and non-Party members should not be allowed to participate in discussions or know about it. In short, everyone should be treated equally and become one family.

	Four, the situation of "not being able to integrate into daily life." Even if Party members and non-Party members are treated equally at work, their cooperative relationship will be affected if they cannot integrate into daily life. For example, there is such a not uncommon situation: several Party members are gathering together and chatting happily, and a non-Party member walks in, and immediately there is an atmosphere of "a bird enters the forest, and a hundred birds suppress their voices," and they no longer talk and laugh, which is really a great disappointment. Even if they are polite to this non-Party member, speak politely, stand up, offer a seat, etc., after a while, one person walks out, and then another person walks out, and even everyone walks out, leaving only this one non-Party member, making him feel very "alienated." Doesn't this affect the cooperative relationship?! Therefore, Party members and non-Party members must not only be treated equally at work, but also integrate into daily life in order to truly have a good cooperative relationship.

Finally, in order to ensure a good cooperative relationship between Party members and non-Party members, I suggest that this issue be regarded as an important condition for performance evaluation and ranking. Party members who have a good cooperative relationship with non-Party members will receive good performance evaluation and ranking, otherwise, they will receive bad performance evaluation and ranking. Non-Party members who believe that Party members have violated this relationship should boldly and conscientiously put forward their opinions and criticisms and will receive good performance evaluation and ranking. Otherwise, if they hold grievances without expressing them, or even say "second words" behind their backs, they will receive bad performance evaluation and ranking. In this way, we can encourage and ensure that Party members and non-Party members work together to have a good cooperative relationship between Party members and non-Party members.

I hereby submit these suggestions for your reference and look forward to your criticism.

    关于党与非党合作共事的几点建议中国
    人民政治协商会议河北省委员会委员　赵子懋
    巩固和扩大统一战线，把各阶层、各民族、各党派，以及各方面的爱国人士团结在中国共产党的周围，一致为建设社会主义而奋斗，这是中国共产党一贯的政策，也是中国革命成功的一个重要条件。最近，中共中央、毛主席又着重提出中国共产党与各民主党派“长期共存，互相监督”的方针，中共中央统战部李维汉部长在第一届全国人民代表大会第三次会议上更明确地指示：要搞好机关、学校、企业里党与非党的合作共事关系，这真是最英明最伟大的方针和措施。
    我在一个统战组织——政协河北省委员会工作多年了，我知道中共河北省委统战部是怎样正确地大力地在贯彻执行这个政策这个方针的。8月4日它召开关于这个问题的座谈会，虚怀若谷地征求大家的意见，这是多么令人兴奋、愉快和佩服的事呀！的确，必须这样，才能更好地发掘非党员的潜力，才能更好地发挥非党员的积极性和创造性，才能使统一战线在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中起到最大的作用。
    党（包括共产党）将来是要消亡的，到那个时候，“皮之不存，毛将焉附”，就无所谓“互相监督”了。可是人是日益兴旺，要发展为“天下一家”，和高度的合作共事。现在我们谈党员与非党员的合作共事关系，将来也可以说永远要谈你与我，这人与那人的合作共事关系。所以我现在只谈一谈机关、学校、企业里党与非党的合作共事关系吧。
    首先须要说明，这个问题，近几年来，已经逐渐得到相当的解决，尤其最近一年来，更是有显著的进步。但是为了求全，为了作的尽善尽美，我们还是更进一步地找出还存在着哪些问题，不管它是个别的或者是微小的问题，也必须求得彻底解决。那么，究竟还存在着什么问题呢？根据各方面的也许是不正确的反映和我片面的不成熟的认识，大概有以下几种情况：
    一、所谓“有职无权”的情况，当然，既是“无权”，就无公可办，无事可作，自然也就没有好的合作共事关系之可言了。所以这一个问题是各方面所最注意的，是各方面经常说起的，也是各方面集中力量来进行解决的。两、三个月以前，中共河北省委统战部和政协河北省委员会就曾大力解决了一个省直机关的多年存在的非党首长“有职无权”的问题，现在这个机关党与非党的合作共事关系搞的很好。这说明只要有关方面努力，这个问题是可以解决的。
    二、所谓“客气有余，批评帮助不足”的情况，这意味着党把民主人士也就是把非党员看成是“喜欢个人享受”，“爱好虚荣”的人；可是在“劳工神圣”，
  “劳动光荣”，一切为了建设社会主义的毛泽东时代，人人都会觉悟到，作这样一个人是最可耻的。如果党员要这样对待非党人士，非党人士就很自然地会感到你是看不起他，羞耻他，怎么还会搞好合作共事关系呢？！党员与非党员，必须开诚相见，有什么意见就讲，看到什么缺点就批评，这样作才能互相帮助，互相监督也才能达到团结一致的目的。
    三、“无意识的歧视”的情况。按照制度规章，一部分工作人员，包括党员与非党员，因为工作性质或者工作范围的关系，不需要参加商讨或者不需要知道某一项工作措施（当然不是党内问题，更不是党内秘密），这是对的，可是往往有这种情形，即一部分党员参加了商讨，或者知道了详情，而和这部分党员工作性质，范围和职务相当的非党员却没有参加商讨，不知道详情，也就使得非党员在这些问题上有不被重视甚至被歧视的感觉。这就显得党员在完全不属于党的问题上有些特殊，这也会影响党员与非党员的合作共事关系。既然不属于党内的问题，又不是保密性质的事，既然让党员参加商讨了知道了，也无妨让非党员也参加商讨或者知道，否则就连党员与非党员都不让参加商讨和知道。总之，要一视同仁，要成为一家人才好。
    四、“生活不能打成一片”的情况。即使在工作中，党员与非党员一视同仁了，但是，在日常生活中不能打成一片，也会影响他们的合作共事关系。例如有这样并不鲜见的情况：好几位党员正在一起聚首言欢，一位非党员走进来了，立刻出现“一鸟入林，百鸟压声”的气氛，再也不谈笑了，真是大煞风景；纵然对这位非党员有礼貌，讲客气，站起来，让坐位等等，可是一会儿走出去一个人，一会儿走出去一个人，甚至都走光了，只留下这一个非党员，使他大有“异己”之感，这岂不影响合作共事关系？！所以党员与非党员不仅在工作中须要一视同仁，就是在日常生活中也须要打成一片，才能真正搞好合作共事关系。
    最后，为了保证搞好党与非党的合作共事关系，我建议把这一问题作为考绩评级的一个重要条件，党员搞好了与非党员的合作共事关系，就得到好的考绩和评级，否则就得到不好的考绩和评级，非党员认为党员违反了这种关系的时候就大胆地认真地提出意见和批评，就得到好的考绩和评级，否则心怀不满而不提出来，甚至在背后说“二话”，就得到不好的考绩和评级。这样，就可以鼓励并保证党员与非党员共同努力来搞好党与非党的合作共事关系。
    我谨提出这几点意见，供作参考，并盼批评。
