Xinhua News Agency, Yumen, 20th - The Yumen Oil Mine Drilling Company transferred two more drilling teams to work in the Qaidam Basin on September 19th. To date, the drilling company has transferred fourteen drilling teams this year to support the drilling work in oil exploration areas such as Karamay and the Qaidam Basin.

The transferred drilling teams are equipped with captains, technicians, drillers, assistant drillers, diesel drivers, and drilling workers. After practical training at the Yumen Oil Mine, they all possess a certain level of technical expertise. Some teams are even advanced drilling teams. For example, one team transferred to Karamay in late August was rated as an advanced drilling team in both the first and second quarters of this year. One team transferred to the Qaidam Basin also has rich experience in drilling deep wells. Before their departure, they drilled an oil exploration well with a depth of over 3,000 meters in a new exploration area in the Jiuquan Basin.

In order to support the drilling work in oil exploration areas nationwide, the Yumen Oil Mine Drilling Company plans to train 116 drilling teams from April of this year to the end of March next year. As of the beginning of September, the drilling company had trained 33 drilling teams. In addition to a portion remaining to work at the Yumen Oil Mine, the rest are being successively transferred to oil exploration areas such as Karamay and the Qaidam Basin.

    支援克拉玛依和柴达木盆地
    玉门油矿培养大批钻井人员
    新华社玉门20日电　玉门油矿钻井公司在9月19日又调出两个钻井队前往柴达木盆地工作。至此，钻井公司今年已经有十四个钻井队先后调出，去支援克拉玛依和柴达木盆地等石油探区的钻探工作。
    被调出的这些钻井队，都配有队长、技术员、司钻、副司钻、柴油司机和钻井工人，他们经过在玉门油矿的实际锻炼以后，都具有一定的技术水平，有些队还是先进钻井队。如8月下旬调往克拉玛依的一个队，曾经在今年第一、第二两季度，都被评为先进钻井队；调往柴达木盆地的一个队还具有钻探深井的丰富经验，出发以前，他们曾经在酒泉盆地的一个新探区钻成了一口深达三千公尺以上的石油探井。
    玉门油矿钻井公司为了支援全国石油探区的钻探工作，计划从今年4月到明年3月底，要培养训练出一百一十六个钻井队。到9月初为止，钻井公司已经培养训练出三十三个钻井队。这些钻井队除了一部分留在玉门油矿工作以外，其余正在陆续调往克拉玛依和柴达木盆地等石油探区去。
