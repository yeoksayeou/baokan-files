Speech by Comrade Tan Qilong, Secretary of the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

Increasing grain production has always been one of the major issues facing the Shandong Party organization. This autumn and winter, we will complete the socialist cooperativization of agriculture throughout the province; earnestly solve the problems of water conservancy and fertilizer to increase yields per unit area; and properly arrange the proportion of land devoted to grain and cash crops.

I fully agree with the reports made to the Congress by Comrades Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, and Deng Xiaoping on behalf of the Central Committee. Now I would like to express some views on the major issues in developing agricultural production in Shandong.

In recent years, Shandong, like the rest of the country, has made great achievements in restoring and developing agricultural production. In 1955, grain production reached 27 billion catties, and cotton production reached 4.2 million dan. However, at present, the province still only has an average of 520 catties of grain per person per year (including 120 catties of grain converted from potatoes), with only about 360 catties of rations per capita after deducting seeds and feed, which is lower than the national average. Therefore, increasing grain production has always been a major issue facing the Shandong Party. At the same time, in recent years, in order to support national industrial construction and ensure the adequate supply of industrial raw materials, we have vigorously developed cash crops such as cotton, oilseeds, and tobacco, relatively reducing the planting area of grain crops. Therefore, realizing the task of developing agricultural production put forward by the Central Committee of the Party is particularly arduous in Shandong. In order to solve this prominent problem, we are prepared to continue our efforts in the following aspects based on our existing experience.

　　First, further complete agricultural cooperativization and run the cooperatives well. At present, 93 percent of the province's farmers have joined cooperatives, of which 66 percent have joined fully socialist cooperatives. Due to the rapid development of cooperativization, the productive forces in rural areas have been fundamentally liberated, and the speed of agricultural production increase has accelerated. According to the statistics of 33,158 elementary cooperatives in 44 counties in 1955, grain production increased by 30 percent compared with 1954. This year, the unit area yield of wheat in the province increased by 18 percent compared with last year. Although nearly 10 million mu of autumn crops have been affected by wind, floods, and other disasters, it is estimated that the province's total grain output may still reach 30 billion catties, an increase of 3 billion catties compared with last year; cotton may reach 5 million dan, an increase of 800,000 dan compared with last year. Both grain and cotton can exceed the increase targets for 1957 stipulated in the Five-Year Plan. However, in this regard, we still have many shortcomings and mistakes. The main ones are that we had right-leaning conservative ideas before the autumn of 1955, and this year, we demanded too much and too quickly in some measures to increase agricultural production, causing great waste and loss of manpower and materials; at one time, we neglected the leadership of sideline production, which affected the increase in income of cooperative members; at the same time, about 15 percent of the cooperatives in the province are still not well managed and cannot guarantee increased production. Therefore, in addition to completing the province's fully socialist cooperativization this autumn and winter according to the planned plan, we must also earnestly strengthen the leadership of the cooperatives, improve the quality of the cooperatives, and pay special attention to rectifying those cooperatives that are not well managed, so that all the cooperatives in the province can meet the requirements of increasing production and increasing the income of cooperative members.

　　Second, increase the yield per unit area. The yield per mu of grain in Shandong Province was 124 catties in 1949 and has been increased to 241 catties in 1955, but this yield is still very low, and there is still great potential for increasing production. At present, in addition to general agricultural technology reforms, the main key to increasing the yield per unit area is to solve the problems of water conservancy and fertilizer. Existing experience has proved that all those who have solved these two problems have achieved significant increases in production. For example, in 1955, the yield per unit area of grain in Huang County reached 500 catties, the Lijiazhai Township in Junan Mountainous Area reached 549 catties, and the Chenjiazhuang Cooperative in Qufu County reached 450 catties. At present, although the area of irrigated land in the province has increased from 8 million mu last year to 33 million mu, it is less than 30 percent of the province's cultivated land area. Although the number of pigs in the province has increased from 2.9 million last year to 4.72 million, there is only one pig for every 29 mu of land. This cannot but affect the further development of agricultural production. In order to solve these two problems, in addition to vigorously promoting the production increase experience of the above-mentioned advanced units, mobilizing the masses to continue to build farmland water conservancy projects, expanding the area of irrigated land, and comprehensively planning and managing the Weiyun River, Jian River, Shu River, and Wanfu River and other major rivers to solve flood disasters; vigorously promoting the pig raising and fertilizer accumulation experience of the Song Changsheng Cooperative to expand fertilizer sources, we also hope that the central water conservancy department will provide us with support in the overall planning of the above-mentioned major rivers involving inter-provincial matters, as well as in technology, investment, and other issues. In terms of fertilizer, we believe that appropriate consideration should be given when determining grain procurement tasks to solve the difficulty of pig feed. We also suggest appropriately increasing the purchase price of live pigs (currently 0.28 yuan per catty for live pigs, which is too low) to make it profitable for farmers.

　　Third, properly arrange the proportion of planting area for grain crops and cash crops to solve the contradiction between expanding cash crops and increasing grain production. We believe that it is not appropriate to expand the planting area of cash crops too much or too quickly at present, but we should actively start from increasing the yield per unit area. We have not grasped this aspect well enough in the past. Facts have proved that the yield per unit area of farmland can be increased, and there is still great potential. In 1955, many cooperatives had soybean yields of more than 200 catties per mu, which was twice the average yield of the province, while individual cooperatives had as high as 600 catties. Cotton in Gaomi County, despite being affected by insect and drought disasters, still reached 50 catties per mu, exceeding the provincial average (37 catties). Therefore, we hope that the relevant departments of the Central Government will not restrict the planting plan too rigidly, so that we can make reasonable arrangements based on the needs of the country and the specific conditions of the local area.

　　We believe that as long as these measures are taken, the agricultural production tasks stipulated by the Central Government can be fully completed; the grain problem in Shandong can also be completely solved.

    山东发展农业生产上的主要问题
    中共山东省委员会书记　谭启龙同志的发言
    增产粮食一直是山东党组织面临的重大问题之一。我们要在今年秋冬完成全省农业的社会主义合作化；认真解决水利和肥料问题，提高单位面积产量；妥善安排粮食和经济作物种植面积的比例。
    我完全同意刘少奇、周恩来、邓小平同志代表中央委员会向大会所作的报告。现在我仅就山东发展农业生产的主要问题发表一些意见。
    几年来，山东在恢复和发展农业生产上，和全国一样已取得了很大的成绩。一九五五年粮食产量已经达到二百七十亿斤，棉花产量已经达到四百二十万担。但现在全省每人每年平均仍只有五百二十斤粮食（其中尚有薯类折粮一百二十斤在内），除去种子、饲料，每人口粮仅有三百六十斤左右，低于全国平均水平。所以增产粮食一直是山东党面临的重大问题之一。同时近年来为了支援国家工业化建设，保证工业原料的充分供应，大力发展了棉花、油料、烟叶等经济作物，相对地缩小了粮食作物的播种面积。因此，在山东实现党中央委员会所提出的发展农业生产的任务，就显得特别艰巨。为了解决这个突出的问题，我们根据已有经验，准备从下列几个方面继续努力。
      第一，进一步完成农业合作化，办好合作社。目前全省参加合作社的农户已占总农户的百分之九十三，其中参加完全社会主义性质的合作社的农户占总农户的百分之六十六。由于合作化的迅速发展，从根本上解放了农村的生产力，农业增产的速度已经较前加快，据一九五五年四十四个县三三、一五八个初级社的统计，粮食产量比一九五四年增加了百分之三十。今年全省小麦单位面积产量比去年增长了百分之十八。秋季作物虽然有近千万亩受到风涝等灾害，但预计全省粮食产量仍可能达到三百亿斤，较去年增产三十亿斤；棉花可能达到五百万担，较去年增产八十万担。粮棉都可超过五年计划规定的一九五七年的增产指标。但是，在这一方面我们还存有不少缺点和错误，主要是一九五五年秋前犯有右倾保守思想，今年在农业增产的某些措施上又要求过高过急，造成人力物力的很大浪费和损失；并一度忽视了副业生产的领导，影响了社员收入的增加；同时，全省尚有百分之十五左右的合作社还办得不好，不能保证增产。因此，我们除了按照预定计划，在今年秋冬完成全省完全社会主义的合作化以外，还必须切实加强对合作社的领导，提高合作社的质量，特别注意整顿那些还办得不好的合作社，使全省所有的合作社都能达到增加生产和增加社员收入的要求。
    第二，提高单位面积产量。山东全省粮食每亩的单位面积产量一九四九年是一百二十四斤，一九五五年已提高到二百四十一斤，但这个产量仍然是很低的，增产的潜力还是很大的。当前提高单位面积产量，除了一般的农业技术改革以外，主要的关键是解决水利和肥料问题。已有的经验证明，凡是解决了这两个问题的，都获得了显著的增产，如一九五五年黄县全县粮食每亩单位面积产量已达五百斤，莒南山区厉家寨乡全乡已达五百四十九斤，曲阜县陈家庄合作社已达四百五十斤。目前全省水浇地虽然已从去年的八百万亩增加到三千三百万亩，但不到全省耕地面积的百分之三十。全省毛猪虽然已从去年的二百九十万头增加到四百七十二万头，但是平均二十九亩地才有一头猪。这就不能不影响农业生产的进一步发展。为了解决这两个问题，我们除大力推广上述各先进单位的增产经验，发动群众继续兴修农田水利，扩大水浇面积，全面规划治理卫运河、涧河、沭河、万福河等主要河流，解决涝灾；大力推广宋长生合作社养猪积肥经验，扩大肥源以外，同时希望中央水利部门对治理以上几条主要河流有关省与省间的统盘规划，以及在技术、投资等问题上给我们以支援。在肥料方面，我们认为，在确定粮食收购任务时，应予适当照顾，以解决养猪饲料的困难。并建议适当提高生猪收购价格（现在毛猪每斤为零点二八元，太低），使农民有利可得。
    第三，妥善地安排粮食作物和经济作物的种植面积的比例，以解决扩大经济作物与增产粮食的矛盾。我们认为，目前不宜过多过猛地扩大经济作物的种植面积，而应积极从提高单位面积产量着手。在这方面，过去我们掌握的是不够好的。事实证明，农田单位面积产量是可以提高的，潜力还是很大的。一九五五年有不少社的大豆每亩产量二百余斤，为全省平均产量的一倍，而个别社有高达六百斤的。高密县的棉花，在受到虫旱灾害的情况下，每亩仍达五十斤，超过全省平均产量（三十七斤）。因此，希望中央有关部门在规定种植计划时，不要限制过死，使我们能够根据国家需要与当地的具体情况，进行合理的安排。
    我们认为，只要采取这些措施，中央规定的农业生产的任务，是完全能够完成的；山东的粮食问题，也是完全可以解决的。
