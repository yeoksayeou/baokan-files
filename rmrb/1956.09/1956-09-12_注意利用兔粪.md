    Pay Attention to Utilizing Rabbit Manure
    Raising rabbits is gradually becoming a sideline in rural areas, and how to utilize rabbit manure is worth paying attention to.
    Currently, some farmers in some areas discard most of the rabbit manure as waste, which is a great pity. Rabbit manure is quite rich in fertilizer and is an excellent quick-acting fertilizer. Rabbit manure can also be used as agricultural insecticide. Applying it to vegetable gardens and flower beds can eradicate certain pests; applying it to mulberry fields can prevent mulberry tree blight.
    There are currently about 80,000 rabbits raised in Jiangsu Province. Each rabbit can excrete an average of 20 *jin* of manure per month, so there are nearly 16 million *jin* of rabbit manure per month, which can fertilize 400,000 *mu* of wheat fields. From this, it can be seen that rabbit manure is also a significant source of fertilizer.　Fu Zhimin

    注意利用兔粪
    养兔子逐渐成为农村的一种副业，如何利用兔粪是值得注意的事。
    目前有些地区的农民把绝大部分的兔粪当作废料抛弃了，这是非常可惜的。兔粪中的肥分相当丰富，是优良的速效性肥料。兔粪还可以充农药用，施用在菜园、花坛中，可以使若干害虫灭迹；施用在桑园，可以防止桑树的萎缩病。
    江苏全省目前饲养的兔子约有八万只，每只兔子每月平均可以排泄粪尿二十市斤，这样，每月就有兔粪尿近一千六百万市斤，可肥麦田四十万亩。由此可见，兔粪也是一项不小肥源。　傅志敏
