 	Our Premier Zhou Enlai of the State Council delivered a report to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on September 20 regarding the Suez Canal issue. Premier Zhou Enlai pointed out in his report that Egypt's recovery of the Suez Canal Company is completely legal, and at the same time exposed the conspiracy of the United Kingdom, France, and the United States to plunder the Suez Canal. Premier Zhou Enlai stated that the Chinese people firmly support the legitimate action of the Egyptian government in recovering the Suez Canal Company. The Chinese people stand firmly on the side of Egypt together with peace-loving people all over the world. He announced that the Egyptian people can count on the full support of the Chinese people in their great struggle to safeguard national independence and state sovereignty.

 	At the same time, proceeding from maintaining international peace and security and observing the resolutions of the Bandung Asian-African Conference, Premier Zhou Enlai warned those who attempt to play with war that the Chinese people cannot remain indifferent to any attempt to infringe upon Egyptian sovereignty or to carry out armed intervention against Egypt. Premier Zhou Enlai reiterated that the Chinese government firmly advocates resolving the issue of freedom of navigation in the Suez Canal through peaceful consultation on the basis of respecting Egypt's sovereignty and dignity.

 	These words of Premier Zhou Enlai express the thoughts, emotions, will, and aspirations of all our Chinese people. The Chinese people, like the Egyptian people, have suffered long-term colonial oppression, so we can fully appreciate the Egyptian people's enthusiasm and determination to strive for independence and safeguard sovereignty even at the cost of sacrifice. The common memory of past suffering and the common hope for a bright future create a brotherly feeling between us and the Egyptian people. The joy and pain of the Egyptian people are also our joy and pain. We must never allow the Egyptian people to be slaughtered by the imperialists again. At the same time, the Chinese people who have stood up have fully realized their position in the international community and their responsibility in maintaining peace in Asia and the world. We must not allow the imperialists to arbitrarily threaten and undermine peace in Asia and the world.

 	The warning issued by Premier Zhou Enlai on behalf of the Chinese people to the imperialists is very timely. On September 15, the Soviet government, in its statement on the need for a peaceful solution to the Suez Canal issue, also warned that the Soviet Union, as a major power, cannot stand idly by on the Suez Canal issue and cannot but be concerned about the situation caused by the actions of Western countries. Indian Prime Minister Nehru also pointed out on September 13 that the steps currently taken by Western countries contain a serious danger of causing conflict. The United Kingdom, France, and the United States, who are planning the so-called "Users' Association" in London, clearly cannot ignore the warnings issued by these three major countries, which account for nearly half of the world's population.

 	Now, even many people who previously supported the plans of the United Kingdom, France, and the United States have realized that the Suez Canal issue can only be resolved through peaceful consultation, and there is no other way. The chaotic situation that emerged at the London conference discussing the "Users' Association" plan, and the difficulties encountered by the United Kingdom, France, and the United States in trying to win over other countries to support this provocative plan, fully prove this point. However, as Premier Zhou Enlai pointed out, those countries that were invited to participate in the London conference must still be wary of falling into the trap set by the cunning United Kingdom, France, and the United States for armed intervention in Egypt.

 	Those countries participating in the London conference that are unwilling to support the provocative plans of the United Kingdom, France, and the United States should now unite their forces and, together with peace-loving people all over the world, force the United Kingdom, France, and the United States to abandon their plans for armed intervention and return to the path of peaceful consultation. The door to this road is still open. The proposal put forward by Egypt to organize a negotiating body that adequately represents the different views of the countries using the canal has been supported by more than twenty countries. Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Bulganin has now put forward a new proposal, advocating that a summit conference of the heads of government of the United States, the United Kingdom, France, the Soviet Union, India, and Egypt be held in Geneva to discuss the Suez Canal issue. We support this proposal from the Soviet Union because it has opened up a new path for the peaceful resolution of the Suez Canal issue. If the governments of the United Kingdom, France, and the United States do not want to isolate themselves from Asia and Africa and peace-loving people all over the world, if they do not want to gamble their own fate, they must pull back from the brink and begin realistic negotiations.

### 全力支持埃及人民的正义斗争

    全力支持埃及人民的正义斗争
    我国国务院总理周恩来在9月20日向全国人民代表大会常务委员会作了关于苏彝士运河问题的报告。周恩来总理在报告中指出埃及收回苏彝士运河公司是完全合法的，同时揭露了英、法、美三国劫夺苏彝士运河的阴谋。周恩来总理表示，中国人民坚决支持埃及政府收回苏彝士运河公司的合法行动。中国人民同全世界爱好和平的人民一起，坚决地站在埃及这一边。他宣布，埃及人民在维护民族独立和国家主权的伟大斗争中，可以指望中国人民的全力支持。
    同时，从维护国际和平和安全、遵守万隆亚非会议的决议出发，周恩来总理警告那些企图玩弄战火的人说，任何侵犯埃及主权和对于埃及实行武装干涉的企图，中国人民都不能置若罔闻。周恩来总理重申，中国政府坚决主张在尊重埃及主权和尊严的基础上，通过和平协商解决苏彝士运河航行自由问题。
    周恩来总理的这些话，表达了我们全体中国人民的思想、情绪、意志和愿望。中国人民同埃及人民一样，曾经遭受过长期的殖民压迫，因此我们完全能够体会埃及人民宁愿牺牲也要争取独立、维护主权的热情和决心。对于过去的苦难的共同的记忆和对于美好的将来的共同的希望，使我们同埃及人民之间有着兄弟般的感情。埃及人民的欢乐和痛苦，也就是我们的欢乐和痛苦。我们决不能听任埃及人民再受帝国主义者的宰割。同时，站起来了的中国人民已经完全认识到了自己在国际大家庭中的地位和在维护亚洲和世界和平中的责任。我们决不能听任帝国主义者任意威胁和破坏亚洲和世界的和平。
    周恩来总理代表中国人民向帝国主义者发出的警告，是非常及时的。9月15日，苏联政府在关于必须和平解决苏彝士运河问题的声明中，也曾经警告说，苏联作为一个大国，不能对苏彝士运河问题袖手旁观，不能不关心由于西方国家的行动而造成的局势。印度尼赫鲁总理在9月13日也指出，西方国家目前采取的步骤包含着引起冲突的严重危险。对于占世界近一半人口的这三个大国所提出的警告，正在伦敦策划所谓“使用国协会”的英、法、美三国，显然决不能当作耳边风而不加理会。
    现在，甚至从前支持英、法、美计划的许多人也已经认识到，苏彝士运河问题只能通过和平协商来解决，其他的道路是没有的。在讨论“使用国协会”计划的伦敦会议上出现的混乱局面，英、法、美在拉拢其他国家支持这个挑衅计划中所遭遇到的困难，充分证明了这一点。但是，正如周恩来总理所指出的，那些应邀参加伦敦会议的国家，仍然要严防掉进诡计多端的英、法、美三国所布置的对埃及进行武装干涉的陷阱里面去。
    参加伦敦会议的那些不愿意支持英、法、美挑衅计划的国家，现在应当团结它们的力量，同全世界爱好和平的人民一起，迫使英、法、美放弃它们武装干涉的打算，改走到和平协商的道路上来。通到这条道路的门还是敞开着的。埃及提出的组织一个足以代表使用运河各国的不同意见的谈判机构的建议，已经得到了二十多个国家的支持。苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁现在又提出了一个新的建议，主张在日内瓦召开美、英、法、苏、印度、埃及六国政府首脑会议，讨论苏彝士运河问题。我们支持苏联的这个建议，因为它给和平解决苏彝士运河问题又开辟了一条新的道路。英、法、美三国政府如果不想自绝于亚非两洲和全世界爱好和平的人民，如果不想拿自己的命运孤注一掷，它们就必须悬崖勒马，开始进行实事求是的谈判。
