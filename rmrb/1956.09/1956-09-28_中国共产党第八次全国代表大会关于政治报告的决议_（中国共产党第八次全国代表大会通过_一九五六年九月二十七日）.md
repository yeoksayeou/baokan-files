    I.
    After discussing the political report delivered by Comrade Liu Shaoqi on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China considers the political line adopted by the Central Committee since the Seventh National Congress to be correct and decides to approve this report.
    Our Party has led the Chinese people, completed the bourgeois democratic revolution, and basically achieved victory in the socialist revolution. This has brought about a completely new social landscape in our country. The main contradiction of the old Chinese society, namely the contradiction between the Chinese people and the rule of imperialism, feudal-ism, and bureaucratic capitalism, has been resolved due to the victory of the bourgeois democratic revolution. After resolving this contradiction, the main contradiction in our country, apart from the external contradiction with imperialism, is the contradiction between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, which is the contradiction that the socialist revolution seeks to resolve. Our socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce is aimed at changing bourgeois ownership and the small private ownership that is the root of capitalism. Now that this socialist transformation has achieved a decisive victory, it indicates that the contradiction between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in our country has been basically resolved, the history of the class exploitation system for thousands of years has basically ended, and the socialist system has been basically established in our country.
    In the past century, the economic and cultural development of our country has lagged far behind the advanced levels of the world, and the broad masses of conscious and patriotic people have always demanded that our country be transformed from a backward agricultural country into an advanced industrial country. Our Party has long pointed out that, in order to achieve this goal, it is necessary first to overthrow the semi-feudal and semi-colonial political and economic systems that fetter the social productive forces, and pointed out that, under the conditions of modern China, only the establishment of a socialist system can truly solve the problem of industrialization in our country. Thanks-to the victory of the bourgeois democratic revolution and the socialist revolution, the obstacles to the development of productive forces have been basically removed. There is no doubt that our people must continue to fight for the liberation of Taiwan, for the complete fulfillment of the socialist transformation, for the final elimination of the system of exploitation, and for the continued elimination of the remaining counter-revolutionary forces. It is absolutely impermissible not to resolutely carry out these struggles. However, the main contradiction in our country is already the one between the people's demand for building an advanced industrial country and the reality of a-backward agricultural country, and between the people's need for rapid economic and cultural development and the current situation in which the economy and culture cannot meet the needs of the people. The essence of this contradiction, under the condition that the socialist system has been established in our country, is the contradiction between the advanced socialist system and the backward social productive forces. The current main task of the Party and the people of the whole country is to concentrate our efforts on resolving this contradiction and transforming our country from a backward agricultural country into an advanced industrial country as soon as possible. This task is very arduous, and we must adopt correct policies in the economic, political, and cultural fields, unite all forces that can be united at home and abroad, and utilize all favorable conditions to accomplish this great task.
    II.
    In order to transform our country from a backward agricultural country into an advanced socialist industrial country, we must build a basically complete industrial system within three five-year plans or a little more time, so that industrial production occupies a major position in social production, heavy industrial production occupies a significant advantage in the entire industrial production, and the machine-building industry and metallurgical industry can guarantee the needs of socialist expanded reproduction, and the technological transformation of the national economy can obtain the necessary material basis. The construction of such an industrial system is not only of great significance for promoting the comprehensive development of our national economy, but also of great significance for strengthening the cooperation between socialist countries and promoting the common upsurge of the economies of socialist countries.
    In the process of realizing socialist industrialization, the following series of economic policy issues should be clearly resolved:
    First, it is necessary to continue to adhere to the policy of giving priority to the development of heavy industry, actively expand the construction of the metallurgical industry, machine-building industry, power industry, coal industry, petroleum industry, chemical industry, and building materials industry, and actively establish and develop the parts of our heavy industry that are currently lacking or weak and most urgently needed, such as the smelting of high-grade alloy steel and rare metals, the manufacture of heavy machinery, special machine tools and instruments, the construction of organic synthetic chemical industry, radio industry and atomic energy industry, etc. There should be no neglect of the basic construction policy of giving priority to the development of heavy industry. The tendency to demand that all construction undertakings advance simultaneously regardless of their importance and urgency is wrong.
    Second, while giving priority to the development of heavy industry, we must actively develop light industry based on the availability of raw materials, capital, and market needs. Only by adopting this policy can we have more consumer goods to supply the people's growing living needs and continue to maintain price stability; can we have more daily-use industrial products to exchange for agricultural products and consolidate the worker-peasant alliance economically; can we accumulate funds faster to help the development of heavy industry. Unilaterally emphasizing the development of heavy industry while neglecting the development of light industry will, in the end, weaken heavy industry instead.
    Third, agriculture has extremely significant and multifaceted impacts on the cause of industrialization. The development of agriculture not only directly affects the people's living standards and the speed of light industry development, but also affects the speed of heavy industry development. At present, agricultural production in our country cannot meet the growing needs, and greater efforts must be made to develop agriculture in the future. However, in the near future, our country cannot have a large agricultural machinery industry and chemical fertilizer industry, cannot carry out large-scale land reclamation, and cannot quickly eradicate waterlogging and drought disasters. Therefore, the main way to increase agricultural production at present is to fully utilize the superior condition that agricultural cooperation has been basically realized, rely on the collective strength of the cooperatives and the support of the government, and take measures such as building water conservancy projects, increasing fertilizer application, improving soil, improving varieties, promoting new agricultural tools, increasing multiple cropping index, improving farming methods, and preventing and controlling diseases and pests, to increase yield per unit area. In addition, wasteland should be actively reclaimed and the cultivated land area expanded according to possible conditions. Grain production is the foundation of the agricultural economy and must be given priority; at the same time, the production of cotton and other various cash crops must be developed in appropriate proportions, as well as animal husbandry and sideline production, and the diversified economy of agriculture. In order to promote the production enthusiasm of farmers, in addition to the state's implementation of correct taxation policies, grain policies, and price policies, agricultural production cooperatives must adhere to the principles of running the cooperatives diligently and thriftily and democratically, correctly handle the relationship between the collective and the individual within the cooperatives, and further consolidate the collective ownership system.
    Fourth, in order to develop industry and agriculture, it is necessary to develop the transportation and commerce industries accordingly. In terms of the transportation industry, the transportation forces should be rationally organized, the construction of new lines should continue, necessary technical modifications should be made to the original lines (first and foremost, the sections of the railway that are under heavy transport pressure), and folk transport tools should be fully utilized. In terms of commerce, due to the basic completion of the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce, a unified socialist market has been formed in our country. In order to adapt to the new economic situation and the needs of the people, this unified socialist market should be dominated by the state market, supplemented by a free market under state leadership within a certain scope, as a supplement to the state market. To this end, corresponding measures must be taken to improve the purchase and sales relationships and market management methods, and prices must be adjusted reasonably to facilitate the expansion of commodity circulation and the development of industrial and agricultural production.
    Fifth, the superiority of socialism must not only be manifested in the quantity and speed of economic achievements, but also in its quality. At present, the quality of many products and projects is not high, and the quality of some daily-use industrial products and handicrafts has even declined compared to before, causing losses to the state and the people. This phenomenon must be resolutely changed. We must overcome the tendency to unilaterally pursue quantity while neglecting quality in all enterprises, cultivate a climate of attaching importance to quality, and formulate reasonable product standards and technological regulations according to needs and possibilities. Factories, mines, and construction sites where the inspection system is not strict must quickly establish quality inspection and technical supervision organizations and systems. In the process of improving quality, we must also pay attention to reducing costs and strive to comprehensively fulfill the state plan.
    Sixth, in order to build a basically complete industrial system and promote the technological transformation of the national economy, it is necessary to gather and strengthen the forces for designing new products in the heavy industry sector, enhance manufacturing capabilities, and gradually promote production standardization, strengthen professional and collaborative cooperation, so as to improve our country's technical level. In the coming period, for major industrial products, especially technical equipment necessary for national construction and the technological transformation of the national economy, we should gradually achieve the goal of being able to independently design and manufacture them through imitation. In this process, on the one hand, we need to widely absorb the latest scientific and technological achievements of the Soviet Union, other people's democratic countries, and other countries in the world; on the other hand, we need to closely combine our country's natural and economic conditions, design and produce new products that are suitable for our country's specific needs. Only by relying on these major efforts and the technical support of socialist countries can we gradually complete the arduous task of technologically transforming our national economy.
    Seventh, in order to promote the common development of the national economy throughout the country, we must correctly solve the problem of the layout of industry and other economic undertakings. In the relationship between inland and coastal areas, we must continue to rationally shift the industrial focus to the inland and develop economic undertakings in the inland, and at the same time, we must fully utilize and rationally develop the economic undertakings in the coastal areas, especially to fully utilize the original industrial bases in the coastal areas to rapidly promote the construction of new industrial bases in the inland. In the relationship between the central government and the local governments, we must give play to the initiative of the central economic departments and the initiative of the local governments; we must correct the tendency of blind development in local economic undertakings, and also correct the tendency of insufficient attention and excessive restrictions on local economic undertakings. In the relationship between large-scale industry and medium and small-scale industry, we must strive to build large-scale industrial enterprises that play a backbone role, and also plan to build new and renovate medium and small-scale industrial enterprises that play a supporting role or are suitable for smaller-scale operations.
    Eighth, with the victory of socialist transformation, the main part of the national industrial and agricultural products will be included in the state plan, and production units will carry out production according to the plan. However, in order to meet the diverse needs of society, a part of the products will not be included in the state plan within the scope permitted by the state plan, and production units will directly carry out production according to the raw materials and market conditions, as a supplement to planned production. The state only regulates the production of this part of the products from the perspective of supply and marketing relationships, or only stipulates reference indicators. If this part of the products is forcibly included in the state plan, or the reference indicators are regarded as formal planning indicators, and unnecessary restrictions are placed on the production of these products, it will not be in line with the needs of economic development and people's lives. Similarly, the main body of the socialist economy is centralized management, but there also needs to be a certain range of decentralized management as a supplement. When carrying out economic restructuring of jointly owned public-private industrial and commercial enterprises and cooperative handicrafts, small businesses, and rural sideline industries, we must correctly solve the problem of centralized management or decentralized management according to the specific circumstances of various industries. If we forcibly merge those that should be managed in a decentralized manner and concentrate them for management, it will also not be in line with the needs of economic development and people's lives.
    Ninth, we must appropriately combine state construction and the improvement of people's lives, that is, correctly handle the proportional relationship between accumulation and consumption in national income. In order to realize socialist industrialization, the people of the whole country must subordinate current interests and individual interests to long-term interests and collective interests, work hard and diligently and thriftily, and increase the state's capital accumulation on the basis of developing production and improving labor productivity; at the same time, the government must practice strict economy and conscientiously reduce the expenditure on defense and administrative expenses. However, if the proportion of accumulation in national income is set too high, and attention is not paid to appropriately improving the people's lives on the basis of improving labor productivity, and attention is not paid to the current interests and individual interests of the people, it will damage the enthusiasm of the people in building socialism and harm the interests of socialism. Our taxation policies, price policies, wage policies, and policies for the distribution of cooperative organizations' income should be able to guarantee the capital accumulation needed for socialist construction and also guarantee the gradual improvement of people's lives.
    Tenth, because our productive forces have been liberated, because our country has abundant human and material resources, has the broadest domestic market, and has the support of socialist countries headed by the great Soviet Union, as long as we can correctly handle the above-mentioned aspects of the problem and give play to the enthusiasm of the people of the whole country, it is possible to develop our country's productive forces at a high speed. If we underestimate this possibility, or fail to strive to turn this possibility into reality, it is a mistake of conservatism. However, we must also estimate the current objective limitations in economic, financial, and technical strength, and estimate the necessity of maintaining reserve forces, and should not deviate from the correct proportions of economic development. If we do not estimate these situations and stipulate an excessively high speed, the result will be to hinder economic development and the completion of the plan, which is a mistake of adventurism. The task of the Party is to pay attention to preventing and correcting right-leaning conservative or "left"-leaning adventurous tendencies at any time, and to actively and steadily promote the development of the national economy.
    III.
    In order to meet the needs of national industrialization, we must vigorously develop cultural, educational, and health undertakings, especially scientific undertakings, higher education, and secondary education. Higher education in our country has developed rapidly in the past few years, but there has also been a tendency to emphasize quantity and neglect quality. In the future, we should continue to increase the number of students as much as possible while ensuring a certain quality. In terms of scientific undertakings, the Party and the government must vigorously help the Academy of Sciences and the scientific research institutions of government departments, universities, and major enterprises, so that scientists across the country have the necessary conditions to realize the twelve-year plan for scientific development and strive to bring many of the most important scientific and technological sectors closer to the advanced levels of the world as soon as possible.
    In order to ensure the prosperity of science and art, we must adhere to the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend." It is wrong to use administrative methods to enforce compulsion and despotism in science and art. We must continue to criticize feudalist and capitalist ideas. However, we must inherit and absorb all useful cultural knowledge of China and foreign countries, and we must use modern scientific culture to sort out our excellent cultural heritage and strive to create a new socialist national culture.
    In order to realize our country's cultural revolution, we must make great efforts to systematically and gradually eliminate illiteracy and popularize compulsory primary education, and carry out cultural education and technical and professional education suitable for the needs of workers and staff members. On this issue, both rashness and impatience and passive conservatism are wrong.
    IV.
    In order to effectively undertake the great task of economic and cultural construction, we must continue to strengthen our country's people's democratic dictatorship. The people's democratic dictatorship after the nationwide victory of the bourgeois democratic revolution is essentially the dictatorship of the proletariat. Its task is to unite the broadest masses of people across the country to jointly build socialism and to fight against the enemies of socialism.
    After our country entered the period of socialist construction, it is of urgent and important significance to further expand the country's democratic life and launch a struggle against bureaucratism. We must use the method of strengthening the Party's leadership and supervision of state organs, the method of strengthening the supervision of the people's congresses at all levels over the state organs at all levels, the method of strengthening the top-down and bottom-up supervision of state organs at all levels, and the method of strengthening the criticism and supervision of the people and the lower-level staff in the organs over the state organs, to wage a persistent struggle against bureaucratic phenomena that are divorced from the masses and reality.
    In order to overcome the bureaucratism of the central and higher-level state organs, and to extensively give play to the enthusiasm and flexibility of local and lower-level state organs, so as to promote the general upsurge of socialist construction in our country, it is necessary to appropriately adjust the administrative management powers of the central and local governments, and the upper and lower levels of local governments, on the basis of the unified concentration that the state has already established.
    Continuing to consolidate the people's democratic united front based on the worker-peasant alliance is a necessary condition for strengthening the people's democratic dictatorship. In order to consolidate the people's democratic united front, we must continue to implement the policy of uniting, educating, and transforming intellectuals, so that the broad masses of intellectuals can form a close unity with workers and peasants in the socialist cause. We must continue to strengthen the work on the national bourgeoisie, give them appropriate arrangements in work and life, so that the vast majority of them can gradually transform into genuine workers under the education of socialist ideology, and contribute their useful knowledge and experience in production and management to the motherland. We continue to unite all patriots among all ethnic groups in the country, and continue to unite overseas Chinese from all over the world. We must continue to strengthen cooperation with all democratic parties and non-party democratic personages in accordance with the policy of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision, and give full play to the role of the People's Political Consultative Conference and consultative bodies at all levels. In all government agencies, schools, enterprises, and armed forces, Communist Party members must be responsible for establishing good cooperative working relationships with non-Party staff.
    Strengthening the unity of all ethnic groups in the country and promoting the common progress of all ethnic groups is a major task in our country's work. We must fully guarantee the rights of ethnic equality and the rights of regional autonomy of the minority ethnic groups living in concentrated communities, and we must pay close attention to the nationalization of ethnic autonomous organs and the work of training minority ethnic cadres. The Han staff working in the minority areas must overcome any great Han chauvinist erroneous views and actively and patiently help the minority nationalities to be the masters of their own affairs, while in the minority staff, attention should also be paid to prevent and correct local nationalist tendencies. All democratic reforms and socialist transformations that have yet to be carried out in minority areas must be considered and handled calmly and after consultation by the people and public leaders of the minority ethnic groups, and must adhere to the method of peaceful means. The relevant departments of governments at all levels must actively develop economic and cultural work in minority areas, and pay attention to gradually developing industry in minority areas and training minority ethnic groups' own working class and industrial cadres.
    Because the socialist revolution has been basically completed and the state's main task has shifted to protecting and developing productive forces from liberating productive forces, we must further strengthen the people' democratic legal system to consolidate the order of socialist construction. The state must gradually and systematically formulate complete laws according to needs. All state organs and state personnel must strictly abide by state laws, so that the democratic rights of the people are fully protected by the state.
    The mass movements to suppress counter-revolutionaries that have been carried out in the past few years have achieved a decisive victory. In the future, we must continue to wage a resolute struggle against the remaining counter-revolutionary forces. But because the counter-revolutionary forces have become increasingly smaller and fragmented, we should further implement a lenient policy toward counter-revolutionaries. With the exception of a very small number of criminals who have committed heinous crimes and aroused public outrage, all other criminals should be exempted from the death penalty, given humane treatment, and educated to become good workers as much as possible. Cases requiring the death penalty should be uniformly judged or approved by the Supreme People's Court.
    In order to safeguard our country's security, we must strengthen our national defense forces.
    Our government should strive to liberate our country's territory of Taiwan by peaceful means, but must also be prepared to adopt other methods to achieve the goal of liberating Taiwan when a peaceful resolution is impossible.
    V.
    In the great cause of building a new socialist industrialized China, in addition to uniting all possible forces at home, we must also unite all possible forces abroad and strive for lasting world peace.
    After World War II, a series of new socialist countries emerged in Europe and Asia, forming a powerful socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and the strength of the socialist movement has also undergone major development in other countries. At the same time, a series of nationally independent countries have also emerged in Asia and Africa, and these countries have formed an important world force; among the nations that are still suffering from colonial oppression, the national independence movement is also developing day by day. This situation has been fully demonstrated in the international struggle caused by Egypt's recovery of the Suez Canal Company. The forces of the socialist movement and the forces of the national independence movement both advocate peace and oppose war. In addition, social forces advocating peace and opposing war are also gradually growing in Western capitalist countries; the governments of some countries, under the pressure of the expansionist policies and war preparation policies of US imperialism, have begun to show a tendency towards peaceful neutrality. Due to the rise of the strength of socialist countries and socialist movements in various countries, the rise of the strength of the national independence movement and the world peace forces, and the deepening of internal contradictions of imperialism, especially the contradictions between Britain and the United States, the US aggressive bloc which insists on expanding its arms race is increasingly isolated and encounters insurmountable difficulties. Under these circumstances, the world situation is tending towards moderation, and the lasting world peace has begun to have the possibility of realization.
    However, imperialists will continue to carry out aggression, continue to create tense situations, continue to oppress all the people they can oppress, the danger of war still exists, and we must not relax our vigilance.
    Our country's policy in international affairs should be: (1) continue to consolidate and strengthen the eternal and unbreakable brotherly friendship with the great Soviet Union and all the people's democratic countries; (2) establish and develop friendly relations with Asian, African, and other countries that support the "Five Principles"; (3) establish and develop normal diplomatic and economic and cultural relations with all countries willing to establish diplomatic relations and economic and cultural relations with our country; (4) continue to oppose the use of force and the policy of threatening force in international affairs, and oppose the policy of preparing for new wars; (5) support the world people's peace movement and develop friendly exchanges with the people of various countries; (6) oppose colonialism and support all anti-colonialist struggles and struggles to defend national sovereignty in Asia, Africa, and Latin America; (7) support the socialist movements of the working class and laboring people of all countries, and strengthen the internationalist unity of the proletariat of all countries; (8) in exchanges with all foreign countries and foreign people, educate our staff to adopt a truly equal attitude, and strictly oppose great-power chauvinism.
    VI.
    Whether all our tasks can be victoriously completed ultimately depends on whether the Party's leadership is correct. That is to say, it depends on whether the Party's leadership can be realistic and integrate the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the practice of the Chinese revolution. Our Party has achieved great victories, the Party's ideological level of Marxism-Leninism has improved, the Party's ranks have become stronger, and the Party's unity has become more consolidated. But there are still many shortcomings in our work. The most fundamental of these shortcomings is that many cadres of the Party have not yet freed themselves from subjectivism in their thinking and work. Subjectivism once caused serious losses to our Party in the revolutionary struggle, and it has also caused some losses in the construction undertakings of the past few years. In the future, in our social life, the ideas of the bourgeoisie and the petty bourgeoisie will continue to exist for a long time, and in socialist construction, we will often face many new problems and tasks that are completely unfamiliar to us. If we are influenced by non-proletarian ideas, if we are complacent and self-righteous, and do not humbly learn, then we will still not be able to avoid the harm of subjectivism. In order to maintain correct and sound leadership, and to overcome the subjective and one-sided nature of the thinking of Party cadres, our Party must constantly improve the ideological level of Marxism-Leninism, especially the ideological level of Marxism-Leninism of senior cadres, and constantly struggle against the ideological tendencies of the bourgeoisie and the petty bourgeoisie; we must adhere to the Marxist-Leninist attitude of seeking truth from facts to guide our work and put all our work on a reliable basis. Only in this way can we make fewer mistakes and not make serious mistakes.
    In order to enable leadership work to be realistic, it is necessary to promote the Party's tradition of the mass line, it is necessary to implement the principle of collective leadership and intra-Party democracy, and it is necessary to overcome bureaucratism and sectarianism. The leading organs of our Party must be good at learning from the masses of the people, good at listening to the criticisms and suggestions of the masses of the people, and testing our leadership in the practice of the masses of the people and correcting our mistakes. Within the Party, we must be good at learning from the broad masses of Party members and cadres, good at listening to different opinions from the same level and lower levels, good at organizing free and practical discussions on policy issues at Party meetings and in Party newspapers and periodicals, allowing a few people to retain their opinions within the limits permitted by discipline, and allowing lower levels to raise objections to higher levels. Only in this way can we have a lively Party life, and our leadership will not make mistakes and be unable to correct them in time. The method of being divorced from the masses, divorced from the collective, unable to listen to dissenting opinions, and using mechanical obedience to maintain leadership authority can only hinder the development of our cause.
    Maintaining the Party's unity and solidarity is the duty of Party members, because the Party's unity and solidarity is the life of the Party and the source of the Party's strength. In the past few years, our Party has smashed the anti-Party alliance of Gao Gang and Rao Shushi, which attempted to split and usurp our Party by conspiracy, which is incompatible with the Party's solidarity. After smashing this anti-Party alliance, the Party's solidarity has become more consolidated. We must also expel anti-revolutionary elements, incorrigible corrupt elements, and other bad elements who have infiltrated the Party. However, for all comrades who make mistakes in the revolutionary struggle, the Party should adhere to the principles of "learning from past mistakes to avoid future ones, and curing diseases to save people" and "clarifying thoughts and uniting comrades," patiently helping them to correct their mistakes, and continuing to unite them to work together.
    We will continue to consolidate the unity of our Party, rely on this unity to unite the working people of the whole country, and unite all forces at home and abroad that should be united and can be united. In this way, we will certainly be able to build our country into a great socialist country as quickly as possible.

    中国共产党第八次全国代表大会关于政治报告的决议
    （中国共产党第八次全国代表大会通过——一九五六年九月二十七日）
    一
    中国共产党第八次全国代表大会在讨论了刘少奇同志代表中国共产党中央委员会所作的政治报告以后，认为中央委员会从第七次全国代表大会以来所采取的政治路线是正确的，决定批准这个报告。
    我们党领导中国人民，已经完成了资产阶级民主革命，并且基本上取得了社会主义革命的胜利。这就使我国出现了一种完全新的社会面貌。在旧中国社会中的主要矛盾，即中国人民同帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义的统治的矛盾，由于资产阶级民主革命的胜利而解决了。在解决了这种矛盾以后，我国除了对外还有同帝国主义的矛盾以外，在国内的主要矛盾是无产阶级同资产阶级之间的矛盾，这是社会主义革命所要解决的矛盾。我们对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，就是要变革资产阶级所有制，变革产生资本主义的根源的小私有制。现在这种社会主义改造已经取得决定性的胜利，这就表明，我国的无产阶级同资产阶级之间的矛盾已经基本上解决，几千年来的阶级剥削制度的历史已经基本上结束，社会主义的社会制度在我国已经基本上建立起来了。
    我国在近百年间，经济和文化的发展远落在世界先进水平之后，广大的觉悟的爱国人民一直要求把我国从落后的农业国变为先进的工业国。我们党早就指出，为了达到这个目的，必须首先推翻束缚社会生产力的半封建半殖民地的政治制度和经济制度，并且指出，在现代中国的条件下，只有建立社会主义制度，才能真正解决我国的工业化问题。由于资产阶级民主革命和社会主义革命的胜利，生产力发展的障碍基本上已经扫除了。毫无疑问，我国人民还必须为解放台湾而斗争，还必须为彻底完成社会主义改造、最后消灭剥削制度而斗争，还必须为继续肃清反革命残余势力而斗争。不坚决进行这些斗争，是决不许可的。但是，我们国内的主要矛盾，已经是人民对于建立先进的工业国的要求同落后的农业国的现实之间的矛盾，已经是人民对于经济文化迅速发展的需要同当前经济文化不能满足人民需要的状况之间的矛盾。这一矛盾的实质，在我国社会主义制度已经建立的情况下，也就是先进的社会主义制度同落后的社会生产力之间的矛盾。党和全国人民的当前的主要任务，就是要集中力量来解决这个矛盾，把我国尽快地从落后的农业国变为先进的工业国。这个任务是很艰巨的，我们必须在经济、政治、文化等方面采取正确的政策，团结国内外一切可能团结的力量，利用一切有利的条件，来完成这个伟大的任务。
    二
    为了把我国由落后的农业国变为先进的社会主义工业国，我们必须在三个五年计划或者再多一点的时间内，建成一个基本上完整的工业体系，使工业生产在社会生产中占主要地位，使重工业生产在整个工业生产中占显著的优势，使机器制造工业和冶金工业能够保证社会主义扩大再生产的需要，使国民经济的技术改造获得必要的物质基础。建成这样一个工业体系，不但对于促进我国国民经济的全面发展有重大的意义，而且对于加强社会主义阵营各国之间的协作，促进社会主义各国经济的共同高涨，也有重大的意义。
    在实现社会主义工业化这个任务的过程中，应当明确地解决以下一系列的经济政策问题：
    第一，必须继续坚持优先发展重工业的方针，积极扩大冶金工业、机器制造工业、电力工业、煤炭工业、石油工业、化学工业和建筑材料工业的建设，积极建立和发展我国重工业中目前还缺乏的或者薄弱的而又是最急需的部分，例如高级合金钢和稀有金属的冶炼，重型机器、专用机床和仪表的制造，有机合成化学工业、无线电工业和原子能工业的建设等等。对于优先发展重工业这一基本建设方针不能有任何的忽视。要求各项建设事业不分轻重缓急地齐头并进的倾向，是错误的。
    第二，在优先发展重工业的同时，我们必须根据原料、资金的可能和市场的需要，积极发展轻工业。采取这个政策，才能够有更多的消费品来供应人民日益增长的生活需要，继续保持物价的稳定；才能够有更多的日用工业品去交换农产品，在经济上巩固工农联盟；才能够更快地积累资金，来帮助重工业的发展。片面地强调重工业的发展而忽视轻工业的发展，结果将反而会削弱重工业。
    第三，农业对于工业化事业有多方面的极其重大的影响。农业的发展不仅直接地影响着人民生活的水平和轻工业发展的速度，而且也影响着重工业发展的速度。我国目前农业生产还不能适应日益增长的需要，今后必须用更大的力量发展农业。但是，在最近的将来我国还不能有很大的农业机械工业和化学肥料工业，还不能进行很大规模的垦荒，水旱灾害也还不能迅速根治。因此，目前农业增产的主要途径，就是要充分发挥农业已经基本上实现合作化这个优越条件，依靠合作社的集体力量和政府的支援，采取兴修水利、增施肥料、改良土壤、改良品种、推广新式农具、提高复种指数、改进耕作方法、防治病虫灾害等项措施，来增加单位面积产量。此外，还应当根据可能条件，积极开垦荒地，扩大耕地面积。粮食生产是农业经济的基础，必须优先发展；同时也必须按照适当的比例发展棉花和其他各种经济作物的生产，并且发展畜牧业和副业生产，发展农业的多种经济。为了发扬农民的生产积极性，除了国家必须实行正确的税收政策、粮食政策和物价政策以外，农业生产合作社必须坚持勤俭办社和民主办社的方针，正确地处理合作社内部集体和个人的关系，进一步巩固集体所有制。
    第四，为了发展工业和农业，必须相应地发展运输业和商业。在运输业方面，应当合理地组织运输力量，继续进行新的线路的建设，对原有的线路（首先是铁路上运输紧张的地段）进行必要的技术改造，并且充分地利用民间的运输工具。在商业方面，由于私营工商业的社会主义改造已经基本完成，在我国已经形成了社会主义的统一市场。为了适合于新的经济情况和人民的需要，这种社会主义的统一市场应当以国家市场为主体，同时附有在一定范围内的国家领导下的自由市场，作为国家市场的补充。为此，必须采取相应的措施，改进购销关系和市场管理办法，并且合理地调整物价，以利于商品流通的扩大和工农业生产的发展。
    第五，社会主义的优越性，不但要表现在经济成就的数量和进度上面，还必须表现在它的质量上面。目前许多产品和工程的质量不高，一部分日用的工业品和手工业品的质量甚至比以前降低，对于国家和人民都造成了损失，这种现象必须坚决地改变。应当在一切企业中克服片面地追求数量而忽视质量的倾向，养成重视质量的风气，并且按照需要和可能定出合理的产品标准和工艺规程。一切检查制度不严的厂矿和工地，都必须迅速建立质量检查和技术监督的机构和制度。在提高质量的过程中，必须同时注意降低成本，为全面地完成国家计划而斗争。
    第六，为了建成一个基本上完整的工业体系和推进国民经济的技术改造，在重工业部门中，必须集结和壮大设计新产品的力量，增强制造能力，并且逐步地推行生产标准化，加强专业和协作的配合，以提高我国的技术水平。在今后一个时期内，对于主要工业产品，特别是国家建设和国民经济技术改造所必需的技术设备，应当通过仿造的办法，逐步达到能够自行设计和制造的目的。在这个过程中，一方面需要广泛地吸收苏联、各人民民主国家和世界上其他国家最新的科学技术成就，另一方面又需要密切地结合我国的自然条件和经济条件，设计和生产适合于我国具体需要的新产品。只有依靠这些重大的努力，并且依靠社会主义各国的技术支援，我们才有可能逐步地完成我国国民经济技术改造的艰巨任务。
    第七，为了促进国民经济在全国范围内的普遍发展，必须正确地解决工业和其他经济事业的布局问题。在内地和近海地区的关系上，既须继续把工业重点合理地移向内地，发展内地的经济事业，又须充分利用和合理发展近海地区的经济事业，特别是应当充分利用近海原有的工业基地来迅速推进内地新的工业基地的建设。在中央和地方的关系上，既须发挥中央各经济部门的积极性，又须发挥地方的积极性；既须纠正地方经济事业中盲目发展的偏向，又须纠正对地方经济事业注意不够和限制过多的偏向。在大型工业和中、小型工业的关系上，既须努力建设那些起骨干作用的大型工业企业，又须有计划地新建和改建那些起配合作用的或者适合于较小规模经营的中、小型工业企业。
    第八，随着社会主义改造的胜利，全国工农业产品的主要部分都将列入国家计划，由生产单位按照计划进行生产。但是为了适应社会的多方面需要，在国家计划许可的范围内，有一部分产品将不列入国家计划，由生产单位直接按照原料和市场的情况进行生产，作为计划生产的补充。国家对于这一部分产品的生产只从供销关系上加以调节，或者只规定参考性的指标。如果把这一部分产品勉强列入国家计划，或者把参考性的指标当作正式计划的指标，对这些产品的生产作不必要的限制，那就不合于经济发展和人民生活的需要。同样，社会主义经济的主体是实行集中经营的，但是也需要有一定范围的分散经营作为补充。在对于公私合营的工商业和合作化了的手工业、小商业、农村副业进行经济改组的时候，必须根据各行各业的具体情况，正确地解决集中经营或者分散经营的问题。如果把应当分散经营的勉强地合并起来集中经营，那也就不合于经济发展和人民生活的需要。
    第九，必须使国家建设和人民生活改善这两个方面得到适当的结合，也就是使国民收入中积累和消费的比例关系得到正确的处理。为了实现社会主义工业化，全国人民必须使当前利益和个人利益服从长远利益和集体利益，艰苦奋斗，克勤克俭，在发展生产和提高劳动生产率的基础上增加国家的资金积累；同时，政府必须厉行节约，认真节减国防费用和行政费用的支出。但是如果过高地规定国民收入中积累的比重，不注意在劳动生产率提高的基础上适当地改善人民的生活，不注意人民群众当前利益和个人利益，就会损害人民群众建设社会主义的积极性，损害社会主义的利益。我们的税收政策、物价政策、工资政策和合作社组织收益的分配政策，应当既能够保证社会主义建设所需要的资金积累，又能够保证人民生活的逐步改善。
    第十，由于我国生产力获得了解放，由于我国有丰富的人力和物力的资源，有最广阔的国内市场，有以伟大的苏联为首的社会主义各国的支援，只要我们能够正确地处理上述各方面的问题，发扬全国人民的积极性，就有可能高速度地发展我国的生产力。如果对于这种可能性估计不足，或者不努力把这种可能性变为现实性，那就是保守主义的错误。但是，我们也必须估计到当前的经济上、财政上和技术力量上的客观限制，估计到保持后备力量的必要，而不应当脱离经济发展的正确比例。如果不估计到这些情况而规定一种过高的速度，结果就会反而妨碍经济的发展和计划的完成，那就是冒险主义的错误。党的任务，就是要随时注意防止和纠正右倾保守的或“左”倾冒险的倾向，积极地而又稳妥可靠地推进国民经济的发展。
    三
    为了适应国家工业化的需要，必须大力地发展文化教育卫生事业，特别是科学事业、高等教育和中等教育事业。我国高等教育在过去几年中有了迅速的发展，但是也发生了强调数量、忽视质量的倾向。今后，应当在保证一定质量的条件下，尽可能地继续增加学生的数量。在科学事业方面，党和政府必须大力帮助科学院和政府各部、各高等学校、各大企业的科学研究机关，使全国的科学家有必要的条件实现科学发展的十二年规划，争取许多最重要的科学和技术部门尽快地接近世界先进水平。
    为了保证科学和艺术的繁荣，必须坚持“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针。用行政的方法对于科学和艺术实行强制和专断，是错误的。对于封建主义和资本主义的思想，必须继续进行批判。但是，对于中国过去的和外国的一切有益的文化知识，必须加以继承和吸收，并且必须利用现代的科学文化来整理我国优秀的文化遗产，努力创造社会主义的民族的新文化。
    为了实现我国的文化革命，必须用极大的努力有计划地、逐步地扫除文盲和普及小学义务教育，并且在职工和机关工作人员中进行适合需要的文化教育和技术、业务教育。在这个问题上，急躁冒进或者消极保守都是错误的。
    四
    为了有效地担负起伟大的经济文化建设任务，必须继续加强我国的人民民主专政。在资产阶级民主革命取得全国胜利以后的人民民主专政，实质上就是无产阶级专政。它的任务就是团结全国最广大的人民来共同建设社会主义，并且同社会主义的敌人作斗争。
    在我国进入社会主义建设时期以后，进一步地扩大国家的民主生活，开展反对官僚主义的斗争，有迫切的、重要的意义。必须用加强党对于国家机关的领导和监督的方法，用加强各级人民代表大会对于各级国家机关的监督的方法，用加强各级国家机关的由上而下和由下而上的监督的方法，用加强人民群众和机关中的下级工作人员对于国家机关的批评和监督的方法，来同脱离群众、脱离实际的官僚主义现象作坚持不懈的斗争。
    为了克服中央和上级国家机关的官僚主义，为了广泛地发挥地方和下级国家机关的积极性、机动性，以促进我国社会主义建设的普遍高涨，必须在国家所已经建立的统一集中的基础上，适当地调整中央和地方、上级地方和下级地方的行政管理职权。
    继续巩固以工农联盟为基础的人民民主统一战线，是加强人民民主专政的必要条件。为了巩固人民民主统一战线，必须继续贯彻执行团结、教育、改造知识分子的政策，使广大的知识分子在社会主义事业中同工人农民形成亲密的团结。必须继续加强对于民族资产阶级的工作，给以工作上和生活上的适当安排，使他们中间的绝大多数人在社会主义思想的教育下逐步改造成为名副其实的劳动者，把他们在生产上、经营上有用的知识和经验贡献给祖国。必须继续团结国内各民族中的一切爱国人士，继续团结国外各地的华侨。必须按照长期共存、互相监督的方针，继续加强同各民主党派和无党派民主人士的合作，并且充分发挥人民政治协商会议和各级协商机构的作用。在一切政府机关、学校、企业和武装部队中，共产党员都必须负责建立起同党外工作人员合作共事的良好关系。
    加强国内各民族的团结，促进各民族的共同进步，是我们国家工作中的一项重大的任务。必须充分保障民族平等的权利和聚居的少数民族的区域自治的权利，必须切实注意民族自治机关的民族化和培养少数民族干部的工作。在少数民族地区的汉族工作人员必须克服任何大汉族主义的错误观点，积极地耐心地帮助少数民族当家作主，而在少数民族工作人员中，也应当注意防止和纠正地方民族主义的倾向。凡属少数民族地区尚待进行的民主改革和社会主义改造，必须由少数民族的人民和公众领袖从容考虑，协商处理，并且坚持用和平的方式进行。各级政府的有关部门必须积极发展少数民族地区的经济和文化工作，并且注意在少数民族地区逐步地发展工业，培养少数民族自己的工人阶级和工业干部。
    由于社会主义革命已经基本上完成，国家的主要任务已经由解放生产力变为保护和发展生产力，我们必须进一步加强人民民主的法制，巩固社会主义建设的秩序。国家必须根据需要，逐步地系统地制定完备的法律。一切国家机关和国家工作人员必须严格遵守国家的法律，使人民的民主权利充分地受到国家的保护。
    过去几年进行的镇压反革命的群众运动，已经取得了决定性的胜利。今后对于反革命残余势力还必须继续进行坚决的斗争。但是因为反革命力量已经日益缩小和分化，对于反革命分子应当进一步实行宽大政策。除极少数罪大恶极、引起人民公愤的罪犯不能不处死刑以外，其余罪犯应当一律免处死刑，并且给以人道的待遇，尽可能把他们教育成为善良的劳动者。需要处死刑的案件，应当一律归最高人民法院判决或者核准。
    为了保卫我国的安全，必须加强国防力量。
    我国政府应当争取用和平方式解放我国的领土台湾，但是也要准备在不能和平解决的时候，采取其他的方式达到解放台湾的目的。
    五
    在建设社会主义的工业化的新中国的伟大事业中，除了必须团结国内一切可能团结的力量以外，还必须团结国外一切可能团结的力量，努力争取世界的持久和平。
    在第二次世界大战以后，在欧洲和亚洲出现了一系列新的社会主义国家，组成了以苏联为首的强大的社会主义阵营，而在其他国家中，社会主义运动的力量也有了重大的发展。同时，在亚洲和非洲还出现了一系列的民族独立国家，这些国家形成了一种重要的世界力量；在还受着殖民主义压迫的民族中，民族独立运动也正在日益发展。这一形势，在埃及收回苏伊士运河公司所引起的国际斗争中，充分地显示出来了。社会主义运动的力量和民族独立运动的力量都是主张和平、反对战争的。此外，在西方资本主义国家中，主张和平、反对战争的社会力量也在逐渐增长；某些国家的政府由于身受美帝国主义扩张政策和备战政策的压迫，已经开始表现了和平中立的趋势。由于社会主义国家和各国社会主义运动的力量的高涨，由于民族独立运动的力量和世界和平力量的高涨，由于帝国主义内部矛盾特别是英美矛盾的加深，坚持扩军备战政策的美国侵略集团日益陷于孤立，日益遇到不可克服的困难。在这种情况下，世界局势正在趋向和缓，世界的持久和平已经开始有了实现的可能。
    但是帝国主义者还会继续进行侵略，继续制造紧张局势，还要压迫一切他们可能压迫的人民，战争的危险仍然存在，我们决不可以放松警惕。
    我国在国际事务中的方针应当是：（一）继续巩固和加强同伟大的苏联和各人民民主国家的永恒的、牢不可破的兄弟友谊；（二）同赞成“五项原则”的亚洲、非洲国家和其他国家建立和发展友好关系；（三）同一切愿意同我国建立外交关系和经济文化关系的国家建立和发展正常的外交关系和经济文化关系；（四）继续反对在国际事务中使用武力和武力威胁政策，反对准备新战争的政策；（五）支持世界人民的和平运动，发展同各国人民的友好往来；（六）反对殖民主义，支持亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的一切反殖民主义和保卫民族主权的斗争；（七）支持各国工人阶级和劳动人民的社会主义运动，加强各国无产阶级的国际主义团结；（八）在同一切外国和外国人民的交往中，教育自己的工作人员采取真正平等对待的态度，严格反对大国主义。
    六
    我们的一切任务能否胜利地完成，归根结底，是决定于党的领导是否正确。也就是说，决定于党的领导能否实事求是，能否将马克思列宁主义的普遍真理同中国革命的实践密切结合起来。我们的党已经取得了巨大的胜利，党的马克思列宁主义思想水平是提高了，党的队伍是更加壮大了，党的团结是更加巩固了。但是我们的工作还有许多缺点。这些缺点中最根本的，就是在党的许多干部的思想和工作中，还没有摆脱主观主义。主观主义曾经使我们的党在革命斗争中受过严重的损失，在过去几年的建设事业中也已经造成过一些损失。今后在我们的社会生活中，资产阶级、小资产阶级的思想仍将长期残存着，而且在社会主义建设中，我们将经常面对着许多对于我们完全生疏的新的问题和工作。如果我们沾染了非无产阶级思想的影响，如果我们骄傲自满，自以为是，而不虚心学习，那么我们就仍然不能避免主观主义的危害。为了保持正确的、健全的领导，克服党内干部的思想上的主观性和片面性，我们党必须不断地提高马克思列宁主义的思想水平，特别是提高高级干部的马克思列宁主义的思想水平，不断地同资产阶级、小资产阶级的思想倾向进行斗争；必须坚持用马克思列宁主义的实事求是的态度来指导工作，把我们的一切工作放在确实可靠的基础上。只有这样，我们才能够少犯错误和不犯严重的错误。
    为了使领导工作能够做到实事求是，就必须发扬党的群众路线的传统，就必须贯彻执行集体领导和党内民主的原则，就必须克服官僚主义和宗派主义。我们党的领导机关必须善于向人民群众学习，善于倾听人民群众的批评和建议，在人民群众的实践中检验我们的领导，修正我们的错误。在党内，必须善于向广大的党员和干部学习，善于听取同级的和下级的不同意见，善于在党的会议上和党的报刊上组织关于政策问题的自由、切实的讨论，在纪律许可的范围内允许少数人保留自己的意见，允许下级向上级提出异议。只有这样，我们才能有生动活泼的党的生活，我们的领导才不致犯了错误而不能及时地改正。那种脱离群众、脱离集体、听不得反对意见、用机械的服从来维持领导威信的办法，只能妨害我们的事业的发展。
    维护党的统一和团结是党员的义务，因为党的统一和团结是党的生命，是党的力量所在。我们党在过去几年中粉碎了高岗、饶漱石的反党联盟，这个反党联盟用阴谋手段企图分裂和篡夺我们党，这是同党的团结不相容的。在粉碎了这个反党联盟以后，党的团结是更加巩固了。我们也必须把混入党内的反革命分子、不可救药的腐化分子和其他坏分子驱逐出党。但是对于一切在革命斗争中犯错误的同志，党都应当坚持“惩前毖后，治病救人”、“既要弄清思想，又要团结同志”的原则，耐心地帮助他们改正错误，继续团结他们在一起工作。
    我们将继续巩固我们党的团结，依靠这个团结来团结全国劳动人民，团结国内外一切应当团结、可以团结的力量。这样，我们就一定可以尽可能迅速地把我们的国家建设成为一个伟大的社会主义国家。
