Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, September 2nd. On September 1st, workers at the Shanghai State No. 2 Cotton Mill successfully spun 120-count high-grade cotton yarn using domestic cotton for the first time. Inspection results proved that the quality of this 120-count yarn meets the first-class, grade-one yarn standard stipulated by the Ministry of Textile Industry.

Spinning 120-count high-grade cotton yarn with domestic cotton is a first in our country. This extra-fine cotton yarn can be used to weave high-grade poplin, light and cool knitted undershirts, and special industrial products. The domestic cotton used this time is a type of long-staple cotton specially cultivated by the Ministry of Agriculture's experimental farm.

From January to August this year, the State No. 2 Cotton Mill has spun a total of ninety-eight types of yarn, ranging from the coarsest 10-count yarn to the finest 100-count yarn. However, in the past, foreign cotton had to be used to spin high-grade cotton yarn above 60-count.

    上海国棉二厂用国产棉
    纺成一二○支高级棉纱
    新华社上海2日电　9月1日，上海国棉二厂职工第一次用国产棉花纺成功一百二十支高级棉纱。检验结果证明，这批一百二十支纱品质合乎纺织工业部规定的一等一级纱标准。
    用国产棉花纺一百二十支高级棉纱，在我国国内还是第一次。这种特细的棉纱可以用来织造高级府绸、轻薄凉爽的针织汗衫和特种工业用品。这次用的国产棉，是农业部实验农场专门培养的一种长绒棉。
    国棉二厂在今年1到8月份，曾经纺制了从最粗的十支纱到最细的一百支纱共九十八种。但是，以往纺六十支以上的高级棉纱，就得用外国棉花。
