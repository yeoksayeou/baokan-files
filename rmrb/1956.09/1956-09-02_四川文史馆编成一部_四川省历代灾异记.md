Xinhua News Agency Report: The veteran researchers at the Sichuan Provincial Cultural and Historical Research Institute have recently compiled a "Record of Disasters and Anomalies in Sichuan Province Through the Ages." This record details the earthquakes, floods, droughts, hailstorms, landslides, land subsidence, and river course changes that have occurred in 143 counties in Sichuan throughout history.

The compilation of this book began in 1953. At that time, some of the veteran scholars at the Cultural and Historical Research Institute helped the Sichuan Provincial Library to sort out the local chronicles of various counties and some classical books. Mr. Ding Zhuochao, who was in his sixties, began to extract the records of disasters contained in the books. From this year, the historical data group of the Cultural and Historical Research Institute also specially established a team to help complete this work together.

The materials for this book are mainly compiled and edited from the local chronicles of various counties, supplemented by various ancient anecdotes and records from modern newspapers. The earliest recorded event is the earthquake that occurred in Guan County in the first month of the second year of Emperor Hui of the Western Han Dynasty (193 BC). The most recent events are the floods, droughts, and earthquakes before and after liberation. Some of the situations included in this book are not recorded in the local chronicles but were personally experienced by the veteran researchers. For example, on the 2nd day of the 7th lunar month of 1933, a ground fissure occurred along the Minjiang River, sixty miles north of Maoxian County in the Aba Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, and the entire town (Diexi) subsided, turning into several large lakes. This event was not recorded in the local chronicles of Maoxian County, Guan County, and other places, but Mr. Ding Zhuochao personally experienced it that year.

### 四川文史馆编成一部“四川省历代灾异记”

    四川文史馆编成一部“四川省历代灾异记”
    据新华社讯　四川省文史馆的老研究员们，最近编成一部“四川省历代灾异记”。这部灾异记记述了四川一百四十三个县历代发生的地震、水灾、旱灾、冰雹、山崩、地沉、河道变迁等情况。
    这部书的编纂是从1953年开始的。当时一部分文史馆老先生帮助四川省图书馆整理各县地方志和一些古典书籍，六十多岁的丁卓超老先生就开始摘录各书中所载的灾害纪录。从今年起，文史馆历史资料组又专门成立了小组，共同帮助完成这一工作。
    这部书的材料主要是从各县的地方志、再加上古代各种杂记、近代报纸的记载整理编辑出来的。记述中，时代最早的是西汉惠帝二年正月（公元前193年）灌县发生地震的情况。最近的为解放前后的水、旱、地震等。这部书收录的有些情况地方志上没有记载，是老研究员们亲身经历过的。例如1933年旧历7月初2日，阿坝藏族自治州茂县以北六十里沿岷江发生地裂，城镇（叠溪）整个下陷，变成几个大湖。这件事在茂县、灌县等地的地方志上都未载有，丁卓超老先生当年曾亲身经历过。
