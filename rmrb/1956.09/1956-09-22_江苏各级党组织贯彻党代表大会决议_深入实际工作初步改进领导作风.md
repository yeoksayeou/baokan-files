Jiangsu Party Organizations at All Levels Implement Resolutions of the Party Congress, Deepen Practical Work, and Initially Improve Leadership Style

(Our dispatch) Jiangsu Province's Party organizations at all levels are actively implementing the resolutions of the Third Congress of the Communist Party of China in Jiangsu Province, delving into grassroots organizations, conducting investigations and research, and have initially improved their leadership over current central tasks. According to recent incomplete statistics, since the Provincial Party Congress, forty-three prefectural, municipal, and county Party committees have submitted more than seventy investigation reports and experience summaries on various specific issues to the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee, including topics such as high-yield experience, sideline production, experiences in developing the cooperative movement in backward areas, relations between towns and industries and businesses, and the lives and welfare of workers.

These specialized investigation and research summaries are generally written around current work tasks, and therefore have shown initial effectiveness in overcoming general leadership and realistically solving problems in current work. Leaders of the Jingjiang County Party Committee did not adequately understand the lower levels in the past, and the county committee's instructions and resolutions were often generalized. Recently, the county committee selected four types of different regions to conduct investigations and research on how to ensure that more than 90% of the cooperatives increased their income, summarized the experiences of all cooperatives that increased their income, analyzed the reasons for decreased income, and consulted with the masses to find solutions. During the plenary meeting of the county committee in mid-August, when discussing this central issue, they quickly made practical resolutions. Dai Shuren, Minister of Production Cooperation of the Huaiyin Prefectural Party Committee, found that in Chengji District, Lianshui County, "only weeds were seen, no seedlings" in peanut and cotton fields when he went to investigate. He then went deep into the agricultural cooperatives to investigate and found out the reasons for the low production enthusiasm of the members. Then, he helped the agricultural cooperative cadres hold meetings, pointed out the measures that should be taken to address the problems in the cooperative, and promptly issued livelihood loans to relieve households in difficulty. As a result, the weed infestation was eliminated in a few days.

Specialized investigations have also promoted the municipal Party committees to improve their leadership over industrial production and the advanced producer movement. In the development of the advanced producer movement in various factories and mines in Suzhou, the Suzhou Municipal Party Committee organized leaders of factories and mines in heavy industry, light industry, silk weaving, and textile industries to universally carry out activities to summarize and exchange experiences, emphasizing the need to be realistic and summarize even small improvements. In this way, many valuable experiences were discovered, including experiences in factory and mine political work, improving enterprise management, promoting advanced experience, and supporting advanced elements and helping backward ones. On the basis of summarizing experience, advanced workers among factory and mine enterprise leaders were also selected. As a result, not only was the enthusiasm of factory and mine enterprise leaders encouraged, but also a way was found to further deepen the advanced producer movement through experience exchange.

This good style of work of leading organs above the county level has also begun to influence cadres at the district and township grassroots levels to pay attention to improving their work style. When the Dagang District of Yancheng County held a cadre and party member meeting, in addition to conveying the resolutions of the Provincial Party Congress, the district party committee secretary introduced a typical investigation material on the experience of changing dry land to paddy fields in the region at the meeting, which greatly enlightened the cadres attending the meeting and made them feel that the meeting was very informative.

At present, from the perspective of the entire province, strengthening investigation and research and making special summaries to improve the style of the leading organs of the Party at all levels is only a beginning, and the far-reaching impact on the Party's entire work remains to be continuously worked on in the future. At present, attention is being paid to preventing deviations such as investigating for the sake of investigation, investigating without research, and topics not being specific, so that investigation and research are closely integrated with effectively solving current central work problems.

### 江苏各级党组织贯彻党代表大会决议  深入实际工作初步改进领导作风

    江苏各级党组织贯彻党代表大会决议
    深入实际工作初步改进领导作风
    本报讯　江苏省各级党组织，积极贯彻中共江苏省第三次代表大会决议，深入基层组织，进行调查研究，初步改进了对当前中心工作的领导。根据最近不完全统计，省党代表大会后已有四十三个地委、市委、县委给中共江苏省委写了七十多份各种专门问题的调查报告和经验总结，包括的内容有丰产经验、副业生产、落后地区开展合作化运动经验和市镇工商关系、工人生活福利等问题。
    这些调查研究专题总结，一般都是围绕着当前工作任务写出的，因而对于克服领导一般化、实事求是地解决当前工作中的问题，已显示出初步成效。中共靖江县委的领导干部，过去了解下层不够，县委的指示决议往往一般化。最近县委选择四种类型不同的地区，对如何保证90％以上的社增加收入进行了调查研究，总结了全部增加收入的社的经验，分析了减少收入的原因，并和群众商量了解决办法。8月中旬县委全体委员会议上，讨论这一中心问题时，就很快地做出了切合实际的决议。中共淮阴地委生产合作部长戴淑仁等到涟水县成集区去调查时，发现朱前乡的花生、棉花田里“只见荒草不见苗”，就深入到农业社进行调查，找出了社员生产情绪不高的原因，然后帮助农业社干部召开会议，针对社里存在的问题指出了应该采取的措施，及时发放生活贷款救济了困难户，结果，几天中就消灭了草荒。
    专题调查也推动了各城市党委改进对工业生产和先进生产者运动的领导。在苏州市各厂矿先进生产者运动的发展中，中共苏州市委组织了重工、轻工、丝织、纺织等产业部门的厂矿企业领导者，普遍展开总结交流经验的活动，强调提出要实事求是，有一点好的就总结一点，这样许多宝贵的经验都被发掘出来。其中包括厂矿政治工作、改进企业管理、推广先进经验、支持先进帮助落后等各方面的经验。在总结经验的基础上，又评选出厂矿企业领导者中间的先进工作者。这样做的结果，不仅鼓舞了厂矿企业领导者的积极性，而且从经验交流中，找到了进一步深入开展先进生产者运动的门路。
    县级以上领导机关的这种良好风气，也开始影响到区乡基层干部注意改进工作作风。盐城县大岗区召开干部党员大会时，除传达省党代表大会的决议外，区委书记在会上介绍了本地区旱地改水田经验的典型调查材料，使到会干部得到很大启发，觉得会议开得很有内容。
    目前从全省情况来看，加强调查研究，专题总结，以改进各级党的领导机关的作风，还只是开始，对于党的整个工作的深远影响还有待于今后继续努力。目前正注意防止为调查而调查，调查不研究，专题不专等偏向，使调查研究与切实解决当前中心工作问题紧密结合起来。
