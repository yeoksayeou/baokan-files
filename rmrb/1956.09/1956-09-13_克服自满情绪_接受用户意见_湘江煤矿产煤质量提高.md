Xinhua News Agency report:

Overcoming complacency and accepting user feedback, the leaders of the joint state-private Xiangjiang Coal Mine have adopted various measures to improve the quality of coal produced. Since August, the amount of gangue (waste rock) in lump coal has decreased, and the pure coal content per vehicle has increased from 30% to 70%. The ash content ratios of various grades of coal are also below the national standards.

After winning second place in the Hunan Province coal mine competition in the first quarter of this year, the coal mine began to develop a sense of pride and complacency. From the second quarter onwards, although the leading cadres discovered that the ash content of their second-grade coal exceeded the national standards month by month, they did not take the necessary measures to improve it. They also did not humbly listen to users' criticisms of the poor coal quality. They had not seriously implemented the "Trial Regulations for Quality Management of Raw Coal at the Pithead" issued by the Ministry of Coal Industry, and the pithead acceptance system was also relaxed. Sometimes they would transport gangue as lump coal and coal with 40% ash content as first-grade coal, all the way to the users.

The coal mine received more and more letters from users criticizing the poor coal quality. In early July, the state-owned Liling Electric Porcelain Factory sent the coal mine a very interesting "gift," which was a piece of gray gangue weighing more than 30 kilograms that the coal mine had once transported to them as lump coal.

In mid-July, a small exhibition was held in the mining area, displaying the users' letters and the returned gangue. At the same time, the coal mine leaders held a meeting to improve coal quality, criticized the complacency of some cadres, and studied specific measures to improve quality. After the meeting, they resolutely implemented the "Four-Part Coal Quality Method" to prevent mixing and affecting quality. At the same time, it was decided not to extract lump coal from the working faces with lower coal quality, and to strengthen the manual selection of lump coal and the removal of gangue. In the production areas with too much fine coal, 50 mm sieves were installed on the dark wells, so that the coal could pass through the sieves, and the problem of too much fine coal in the lump coal was solved.

### 克服自满情绪　接受用户意见  湘江煤矿产煤质量提高

    克服自满情绪　接受用户意见
    湘江煤矿产煤质量提高
    据新华社讯　公私合营湘江煤矿领导上克服自满情绪，接受用户意见，采取各种措施提高了煤的质量。8月份以来，块煤中含矸石减少了，每车块煤的含纯率由过去30％提高到70％；各种等级煤含灰分的比率也都低于国家规定指标。
    这个煤矿在今年第一季度获得湖南省煤矿矿际竞赛第二名以后，开始滋长骄傲自满情绪，从今年第二季度起，领导干部虽已发现他们生产的次一号煤的灰分月月超过国家规定的指标，但都没有采取必要的措施，加以改进。对用户提出的煤质不好的批评，也不虚心听取。中央煤炭工业部颁发的“井口原煤质量管理试行规程”，他们一直没有认真执行，井口验收制度也放松了，有时候就把矸石当作块煤，把含40％灰分的煤当作一号煤运出井，一直运到用户手里。
    煤矿接到用户批评煤质低劣的来信越来越多。7月上旬，国营醴陵电瓷厂给煤矿寄来一箱很有趣的“礼物”，就是这个煤矿曾当作块煤运给他们的一块重三十多公斤的灰色矸石。
    7月中旬，在矿区里开了一个小型展览会，将用户来信和退回的矸石展览出来。同时煤矿领导上召开了提高煤的质量的会议，批判了某些干部的自满情绪，研究了提高质量的具体措施。会后，坚决贯彻执行“煤质四分法”的制度，防止混杂，影响质量。同时决定在煤质较低的工作面，不提块煤，并加强用手提选块煤和拣矸石工作。在末煤太多的生产区，在暗井上安装了五十公厘筛子，使煤通过筛子，煤块中末煤太多的问题也就解决了。
