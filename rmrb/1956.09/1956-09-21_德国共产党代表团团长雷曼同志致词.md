Comrades!
    The delegation of the Central Committee of the German Communist Party extends brotherly and fighting greetings to the glorious Congress of the Chinese Communist Party.

    Through you, dear comrades, we salute the working class and the peasantry, and all the Chinese people building socialism under the leadership of the Communist Party.

    Less than ten years have passed since the brutal Second World War waged by German imperialism and fascism to seize world hegemony, and they are already preparing for a new war of revenge. The German militarists have been chosen by American imperialism to act as gendarmes against European democracy, progress, and socialism.

    Therefore, German militarists and fascist officers are once again being armed, and German youth are once again to be cannon fodder. In the process of rearmament, the people's few democratic rights are constantly shrinking, public opinion is being suppressed, and fighters for peace, democracy, and international friendship are being threatened and arrested. The banning of the German Communist Party is a further step in the plan to establish a military dictatorship in the Federal Republic.

    German imperialists, following Hitler's example, are preparing for war by using frantic chauvinistic persecution, by persecuting Marxism, and by waving the dirty anti-communist banner.

    German imperialists openly advocate occupying the German Democratic Republic with small-scale wars, because, as they say, small-scale wars do not necessarily immediately lead to world wars. Not long ago, a fascist General Heusinger said: "As soon as we have twelve divisions of troops, we will speak differently to the French." Similarly, they are increasingly demanding the restoration of the 1937 borders.

    Comrades! The German imperialists and their Adenauer government are gradually establishing a military dictatorship in the Federal Republic and pursuing a provocative foreign policy, which shows that the dangerous threat to European peace comes from these German imperialists.

    However, the German people have not forgotten the painful experience of the fascist dictatorship and the painful lessons of the Second World War. Therefore, rearmament, especially the implementation of compulsory military service, and the banning of the German Communist Party have been rejected and protested by the working class and even the broad masses of citizens. Young people are widely refusing to implement compulsory military service. Many trade union members have declared their opposition to compulsory military service in their trade union resolutions. Broad masses of young people are preparing to resist military service.

    The idea of peaceful reunification of Germany is increasingly accepted by the people of the Federal Republic. People, especially workers, demand reconciliation with the German Democratic Republic, and the establishment of peaceful relations with all neighboring countries, with the Soviet Union, and with the Chinese people.

    We Communists have a major responsibility to our people and to the people of all other countries. We must better promote and explain the German imperialists' heinous plans to harm the German people and the people of other countries among workers, among working people, and among intellectuals, so that our people know their great responsibility in the struggle for peace, democracy, and progress.

    The German Communist Party, firmly based on Marxism-Leninism, is fighting for its legal existence in the Federal Republic, for the defense of peace, democracy, and social progress, for the abolition of militarism and the restraint of the power of the arms monopoly capitalists and large landowners, and for the end of Adenauer's rule. The Communist Party supports the peaceful reunification of Germany and a democratic German state. To achieve these goals, our party is striving to win the unity of the working class, to unite with the Social Democratic comrades, and to unite all patriots.

    The German militarists and their Adenauer government fear this great popular movement, therefore, the enemies of our people have banned our party.

    However, a party that has deep-rooted foundations in the working class and among the people cannot be extinguished, such a party cannot be taken away from the life of the working class and the nation. Just as German imperialism cannot eliminate the German working class and the German people, it cannot eliminate the German Communist Party. The German Communist Party lives and fights together with the working class and the people. German imperialism has repeatedly attempted to defeat the socialist movement, but history has proven that it is always the imperialists who are defeated on this battlefield, while the working-class party grows stronger and stronger, and thus socialism grows stronger and stronger. Now, Mr. Adenauer and his fascist generals, just like Hitler in the past who did not achieve the goal of eliminating the Communist Party despite using bloody terror, will not achieve their goal.

    In the struggle against German imperialism and militarism, we are not isolated. Our brothers and sisters in the German Democratic Republic, under the leadership of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, are building socialism. They will never let go of the worker-peasant regime. No matter how the reactionaries persecute and slander, the glory of their construction shines on the people of the Federal Republic.

    Each of us feels and sees every day that socialism is definitely superior to capitalism in the world, and is constantly moving forward to new victories. The socialist world system, headed by the Soviet Union, which seeks happiness for mankind, must grow stronger and stronger.

    Dear comrades! We have obtained extremely meaningful teachings for our work at your congress, and we must convey these teachings to our party, to the working class, to the peasants, to the intellectuals, and to all peace-loving people.

    Comrades! In the event of the banning of our party, we have received outstanding evidence of proletarian internationalism. The Chinese people have also expressed their indignation. The statement of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party is a great assistance to the West German working class and our party in the struggle against German militarism, for democracy, and for the legal existence of our party.

    The whole world can see that we are not isolated in carrying out our struggle in West Germany. And at the same time, it clearly shows the reactionary forces that the era of pursuing their aggressive policies at home and abroad with impunity is gone forever.

    Long live the Chinese Communist Party and its Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong! Long live the Chinese working class and peasants, long live the Chinese people!

    Long live the friendship between the Chinese and German people!

    Long live the great Lenin's party, the example of all Communist and Workers' Parties, the glorious Communist Party of the Soviet Union!

    Long live the struggle of the world's working class and the world's people for peace, democracy, and socialism! (Attached picture)

### 德国共产党代表团团长雷曼同志致词

专栏：

    德国共产党代表团团长雷曼同志致词亲爱的同志们！
    德国共产党中央委员会代表团，向光荣的中国共产党代表大会，致以兄弟般的战斗的敬礼。
    我们通过你们，亲爱的同志们，向工人阶级和农民致敬，向在共产党领导下的建设社会主义的全体中国人民致敬。
    德国帝国主义和法西斯主义为夺取世界霸权而进行的残酷的第二次世界大战过去不到十年，他们又来准备新的复仇战争。德国的军国主义分子被美国帝国主义选中来充当反对欧洲民主、进步和社会主义的宪兵。
    因此，德国的军国主义者和法西斯军官们又获得武器，德国的青年们又要当炮灰。在重新武装的过程中，人民仅有的一点民主权利不断缩小，舆论备受压制，和平、民主和国际友谊的斗士遭到威胁和逮捕。禁止德国共产党，更是在联邦共和国计划建立军事独裁政权的又一步骤。
    德国帝国主义者效法希特勒的榜样，用疯狂的沙文主义的迫害手段，用对于马克思主义的迫害手段，打着肮脏的反共旗子，以准备战争。
    德国帝国主义者公开宣传用小型战争占领德意志民主共和国，因为如他们所说，小型战争不一定马上就是世界大战。不久以前一个法西斯将军豪辛格说：“我们一有十二个师的军队，我们就要同法国人说另一样的话了。”同样，他们日益强烈地要求恢复一九三七年的国界。
    同志们！德国帝国主义分子及其阿登纳政府逐步在联邦共和国建立军事独裁政权，并推行挑衅的外交政策，这就说明对欧洲和平的危险的威胁是来自这些德国帝国主义分子。
    但是，德国人民并没有忘记法西斯独裁的痛苦经验和第二次世界大战的惨痛教训。因此，重新武装，首先是实行义务兵役制，禁止德国共产党，都遭到工人阶级以至广大市民阶层的拒绝和抗议。青年广泛地拒绝实行义务兵役制。有很多工会会员在他们的工会决议中声明反对义务兵役制。广大的青年准备抗拒服兵役。
    和平统一德国的思想，日益为联邦共和国人民所接受。人们，首先是工人，要求同德意志民主共和国和解，同一切邻邦，同苏联，同中国人民建立和平关系。
    我们共产党员，对我国人民以及对一切其他国家的人民，负有重大的责任。我们一定要更好地在工人中，在劳动人民中，在知识分子中，宣传解释德国帝国主义危害德国人民及其他国家人民的罪恶计划，使我国人民知道他们自己在和平、民主和进步斗争中的重大责任。
    德国共产党坚定不移地以马克思列宁主义为基础，为争取自己在联邦共和国的合法存在，为维护和平、民主和社会进步，为取消军国主义和约束军火垄断资本家和大地主政权，为结束阿登纳的统治而斗争。共产党拥护德国的和平统一，拥护一个民主的德意志国家。为达到这些目的，我们党为争取工人阶级的团结一致，为争取同社会民主党同志联合行动并团结一切爱国人士而奋斗。
    德国军国主义分子及其阿登纳政府害怕这个伟大的人民运动，因此，我们人民的敌人禁止了我们的党。
    但是，一个在工人阶级中和人民中有着根深蒂固的基础的政党是不可能扑灭的，这样的党是不可能从工人阶级和民族的生命中夺去的。德国帝国主义就像不能消灭德国工人阶级和德国人民一样，它不能消灭德国共产党。德国共产党同工人阶级和人民一起生活着，一起战斗着。德国帝国主义曾经多次企图击败社会主义运动，但是历史证明，在这战场上被击败的总是帝国主义者，而工人阶级政党则日益壮大，从而社会主义日益壮大。现在，阿登纳先生和他的法西斯将军们，就像过去希特勒尽管用血腥恐怖手段也没有达到消灭共产党的目的一样，也不会达到目的。
    在反对德国帝国主义和军国主义的斗争中，我们并不是孤立的。我们德意志民主共和国的兄弟姊妹们，在德国统一社会党的领导下，正在建设社会主义。他们决不会撒手丢开工农政权。不管反动分子怎样进行迫害和诽谤，他们的建设事业的光辉照耀着联邦共和国的人们。
    我们每一个人天天都感到和看到世界上社会主义确定不移地比资本主义优越，并且不断地向新的胜利前进。以苏联为首的、为人类谋幸福的社会主义的世界体系一定日益壮大。
    亲爱的同志们！我们在你们的代表大会上已经获得了对于我们的工作极有意义的教导，我们一定要把这些教导传达给我们党，传达给工人阶级、农民、知识分子和一切爱好和平的人们。
    同志们！在禁止我们党的事件上，我们得到了关于无产阶级国际主义的卓越的证据。中国人民也表示了他们的义愤。中国共产党中央的声明，对西德工人阶级和我们党在反对德国军国主义、争取民主、争取我党的合法存在的斗争中，是一个巨大的援助。
    全世界都看得见，我们在西德进行我们的斗争并不是孤立的。并且同时也对反动势力显示得清清楚楚，不受惩罚地在国内国外推行其侵略政策的时代已一去不复返了。
    中国共产党及其以毛泽东同志为首的中央委员会万岁！中国工人阶级、农民、中国人民万岁！
    中德人民的友谊万岁！
    伟大的列宁的党、一切共产党和工人党的榜样、光荣的苏联共产党万岁！
    世界工人阶级和世界人民争取和平、民主和社会主义的斗争万岁！（附图片）
