    Supporting the Construction of the Karamay Oil Region
    260 Vehicles and Trailers Gather in Xianyang
    Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, August 31st. Recently, the Xinjiang Petroleum Administration dispatched a group of automobile drivers from Urumqi to Xianyang, Shaanxi, to receive 200 new vehicles and 60 trailers assembled there. This batch of vehicles and trailers was allocated by the Ministry of Petroleum Industry to support the construction of the Karamay Oilfield.
    The construction and development of the Karamay Oilfield is very rapid. Although it has received strong support from the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, the current automotive transportation capacity is still insufficient. This allocation of 260 vehicles and trailers from the Ministry of Petroleum Industry to support the oil region will play a significant role in resolving the transportation difficulties of the Karamay Oilfield.

    支援克拉玛依油区建设
    二百六十辆汽车和拖车集结咸阳
    新华社乌鲁木齐31日电　最近新疆石油管理局派出一批汽车驾驶员，由乌鲁木齐前去陕西咸阳，接运集结在那里的二百辆新型汽车和六十辆拖车。这批汽车和拖车是石油工业部调拨支援克拉玛依油田建设的。
    克拉玛依油田建设发展十分迅速，虽然得到新疆维吾尔自治区的大力支援，当前汽车运输力量还是很不足。这次石油工业部调拨来支援油区的二百六十辆汽车和拖车，对于解决克拉玛依油田的运输困难，将起很大的作用。
