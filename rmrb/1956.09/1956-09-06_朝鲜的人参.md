In the history of Korea, many legends and myths about collecting ginseng have been circulated. Ginseng is a specialty of Korea, and Korean ginseng has always been world-renowned. Because of its special effects in nourishing the body and treating diseases, people have called ginseng "divine herb" since ancient times.

Many people have taken or seen Korean ginseng (also called Koryo ginseng) made into medicinal materials, but they may not have seen the full picture of ginseng. Korean ginseng is a perennial herb with a straight stem about fifty to sixty centimeters high. The stem has four to five palmate leaves with five lobes, and at the top are small rose-red flowers clustered in an umbrella shape. The root of this plant is very thick, reaching fifteen to twenty centimeters in length and three to eight centimeters in thickness. The root of ginseng is steamed and dried to become a precious medicine.

Like a spoiled girl, ginseng can only grow under special soil and climate conditions. It is both afraid of cold and heat, and can only grow in cold temperate zones. It is afraid of the sun's rough embrace, but it needs the gentle caress of sunlight, so it must grow in a place where the sun shines obliquely. At the same time, the soil in which it grows must be very dry, and no rainwater is allowed to stagnate. Because Korea has these conditions, it has become a place of wild ginseng production. In addition to Korea, ginseng is only produced in Northeast China, North America and other places in the world.

As early as more than two hundred years ago, the Korean people began to cultivate ginseng artificially. Especially in the past ten years, due to the increasing scarcity of wild ginseng, artificial cultivation has become particularly developed. Between 1931 and 1937, the average annual ginseng output in Korea reached 580,000 kilograms. In Korea, ginseng is grown in almost every province. The Kaesong area has the largest plantation. In addition, ginseng is also grown in P'yongsan, Kŭmch'ŏn, Sohŭng, Pongsan, Ŭn'nyul, Sin'gye, Kŭmsan, Pungsan, Munsan and Kimhwa.

The cultivation of ginseng is a very delicate and arduous cultivation industry. Ginseng can only be grown on the best dry land on gentle slopes and near the foothills. The plantations are called "sampo," and are surrounded by fences, and the fields are divided into many plots. To avoid moisture, the plots are built very high, and to prevent the plants from being exposed to direct sunlight, people build low awnings on the plots with branches and mats. The awnings must be opened and closed at any time depending on the presence or absence of sunlight. Ginseng is sown at the end of March or the beginning of April, and can only be harvested after six years. During these long years, growers must pay attention to nursing every day and every hour. If they are not careful, diseases or insect pests will occur in the ginseng field, and hundreds of plots of ginseng will be completely destroyed overnight, and years of hard work will be in vain.

In the era of the feudal dynasty and the colonial rule of Japanese imperialism, Korean ginseng, a special product of Korea, was an important item for feudal lords and colonialists to plunder and exploit, while the lives of the Korean working people who grew ginseng were very painful. After the liberation of Korea on August 15, the ginseng cultivation industry in Korea also entered a new era. In particular, the liberation of Kaesong area, the main ginseng plantation, has led to the rapid development of ginseng cultivation in Korea. Korean agricultural and botanical workers are actively carrying out ginseng research work, and have made great achievements in preventing and treating ginseng diseases and insect pests and improving cultivation techniques. Thanks to the improvement of technology and the hard work of ginseng workers, the output and quality of Korean ginseng are constantly improving. After the armistice, a ginseng processing factory with modern equipment was also established in Kaesong City. People believe that Korean ginseng will make greater contributions to human health and welfare. (Mei)

    朝鲜的人参
    在朝鲜的历史上，流传着许多关于采掘人参的传说和神话。人参是朝鲜的特产，朝鲜的人参一向闻名于世。由于它在滋补人体和医疗疾病上的特殊功效，自古以来人们曾经把人参称为“神草”。
    很多人服用过或看见过制成了药材的朝鲜人参（也叫高丽参），但是却不一定见过人参的全貌。朝鲜人参是多年生草本植物，它有笔直的茎，高约五十至六十公分。茎上有四至五瓣五裂片的叶子，顶端有集成伞状的玫瑰红的小花朵。这种植物的根非常粗大，长达十五至二十公分，粗达三至八公分。将人参的根蒸后晒干，便成为珍贵的药品了。
    就像一个娇生惯养的姑娘一样，人参要在特殊的土地和气候的条件下才能生长。它既怕冷，又怕热，只能生在温带的寒地上。它害怕太阳粗暴地拥抱它，但又需要阳光温柔的抚摩，因此它要生长在阳光斜照的地方，同时，它生长的土地中必须十分干燥，决不容许有雨水沉滞。朝鲜因为具有这些条件，所以成为野生人参的产地。除了朝鲜以外，世界上只有我国的东北地区和北美洲等地出产人参。
    早在二百多年以前，朝鲜人民便开始用人工方法栽培人参。特别是近十年来，由于野生人参日益稀少，人工栽植更特别发达。在1931至1937年间，朝鲜每年人参产量平均达到五十八万公斤。在朝鲜，几乎各道都种植人参。开城地区拥有最大的种植场。此外，平山、金川、瑞兴、凤山、延白、新溪、锦山、丰山、汶山和金化等地种植的人参也很多。
    人参的栽培是一种很细致、很艰苦的种植业。只有平缓的斜坡上和山麓附近最好的干燥土地上才能种植人参。种植场称为参圃，都用篱笆围着，场内分成许多坪。为避免潮湿，坪筑得很高，为使植物不受到直接的阳光，人们在坪上用树枝和席子搭成低的天棚。随着阳光的有无，天棚要随时开闭。人参的播种时间是3月末或4月初，经过六年以后才能采掘。在这悠长的岁月中，种植者须要每日每时注意护理，稍一不慎，人参圃内发生病害或虫害，仅在一夜之间，就会把数百坪的人参完全毁掉，使数年的辛苦化为泡影。
    在封建王朝时代和日本帝国主义殖民统治的年代中，朝鲜的特产人参是封建主和殖民者掠夺和剥削的重要物品，而种植人参的朝鲜劳动人民生活却十分痛苦。“八一五”朝鲜解放后，朝鲜人参的种植业也进入了一个新的时代。特别是主要参圃——开城地区的解放，朝鲜的人参种植业更获得迅速的发展。朝鲜的农业和植物学工作者积极地进行着人参研究工作，在预防和医治人参的病虫害和改进栽培技术方面都取得了巨大的成效。由于技术的改进和种参劳动者辛勤的努力，朝鲜人参的产量和质量正在不断地提高。停战以后，在开城市还建立了拥有现代化设备的制参工厂。人们相信，朝鲜人参将要对人类的保健福利事业作出更大的贡献。　（梅）
