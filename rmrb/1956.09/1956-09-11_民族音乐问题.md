    National Music Problems
    He Luting

    I
    Folk songs and folk music are the collective creations of working people of all nationalities. Each folk song has been modified or processed by countless people of all generations according to their own preferences. It has a tenacious vitality and strong characteristics unique to its own nation. It is the crystallization of life impressions felt by the working people of all nationalities in struggle, labor, and daily life. Every nation forms different national characteristics due to differences in climate, geography, customs, habits, economy, politics, and so on. These characteristics are also vividly expressed in their national music, making it the richest source of creation for all great realist composers.

    Our China is a multi-ethnic country with thousands of years of history, 600 million people, and a vast territory. Therefore, the richness of folk music hidden in various parts of the country is unmatched by any other country in the world.

    Our national music heritage is mainly in two aspects: one is folk songs and ballads from all over the country, and the other is local operas, including quyi (a traditional Chinese form of performance art). In addition, there are folk orchestras and instrumental solos, including the guqin and zheng.

    In the ocean of folk music of our motherland, there are endless pearl-like folk songs. They have tenacious vitality, passed down from generation to generation, and will always live in the hearts and mouths of the people. They express the deep thoughts buried in the hearts of the people, revealing the pure and true feelings of the people. People can get comfort, encouragement, and happiness from folk songs. Therefore, people love them from the bottom of their hearts and constantly refine them, making them more and more brilliant, so that the works of any great composer cannot compare with folk songs. On the contrary, they must learn from folk songs to achieve something. No wonder Glinka said that the real creator is the people, and the composer only did some adaptation work.

    I think everyone is also familiar with foreign folk songs such as "Auld Lang Syne" and "The Last Rose of Summer," but no foreign folk song has ever moved me as deeply as our own folk songs. Folk songs not only remind us of the mountains and rivers of our motherland, but also of the distant ancient times. During this music week, the singing of Mongolian singer Khazabu reminded people of the boundless Mongolian grasslands. From the tunes of the "Hua'er" of Gansu, we seem to truly experience the life and natural scenery of the people in the upper reaches of the Yellow River, which has a long history. Yunnan folk songs remind us of the beautiful southwest mountain country. A charming Sichuan folk song, "The River Rises and the Sand Waves," aroused my infinite nostalgia and fantasy. I seemed to see with my own eyes the lives of the people on both sides of the Jialing River valley for thousands of years, the steep green hills, the clear rapids, and even the fish and sandbars at the bottom of the water. Comparing these beautiful folk songs with some formulaic original songs is simply like comparing a fairy to a toad. This should attract the attention of all our composers.

    The composer's source of creation comes from the folk, but his creative processing is more complicated and cannot replace folk creation. The folk have their own long tradition and may not be able to quickly accept the composer's works unless his works can truly maintain the simplicity, beauty, and emotional authenticity that are unique to folk songs. Like the works of the Soviet Zakharov, the farmers regard his songs as their own folk songs.

    At present, many people are talking about rescuing national music. I think a lot of work has been done in collecting and sorting out national music, and it should be strengthened even more; but more importantly, it is how to find ways to make these folk songs, which still live in the hearts and mouths of the people, continue to live and develop, so that the flowers of the folk can bloom more luxuriantly. This first requires the attention and enthusiastic promotion of local district and township cadres and those in charge of cultural and educational work in provinces, counties, and villages. In many places, singing folk songs and playing folk musical instruments are considered to hinder production, and orders are issued to prohibit them. Folk artists are considered second-class citizens. Many people hide their musical instruments and stop playing, especially blind artists who are in a worse situation. A few years ago, a blind man, A Bing, was discovered, and recordings and scores were made for him, but he died, and everyone felt very sorry. Little do they know that in the vast rural areas of China, there are countless living blind A Bings living in hardship, with no one to care about, and many folk music treasures buried in their memories are also submerged.

    Rural life is much better now than before. Farmers naturally need cultural entertainment. As long as cultural and educational cadres at all levels of local governments pay attention to promoting and caring for these folk artists, care about their lives, and regularly hold folk song competitions or small folk music performances, it can not only enrich the lives of the people, but also preserve and develop existing folk songs and folk music.

    The types of local operas range from four or five in each province to two or three. Their differences are mainly in their music. The music of each opera has its unique style and strong local color. Local operas, including quyi, are also the result of the processing and refinement of countless unnamed musicians over many eras. The difference between them and folk songs is that they are a more professional collective performance form. Local opera is also a treasure in our rich national music heritage. I have not seen any country in the world with such many and such rich folk art performance forms that combine drama and music. Music in exerting dramatic effects, depicting character, the combination of music and language, as well as singing and playing, etc., has reached a high level in terms of both skill and artistry.

    Marxism believes that humans are social animals, and that nothing in the world exists in isolation, but is always interconnected and mutually influenced. The so-called "nation" is not a race, but a community of people formed by a long history. The elements that constitute a nation are a common territory, a common language, common economic relations, and a common psychological quality, that is, national characteristics. This characteristic is expressed in music as the national musical style unique to the nation.

    National music, like the nation itself, is also formed by a long history. But it does not develop in isolation. Since there has been culture in the world, there must be exchanges. In the past three or four hundred years, European musical and cultural exchanges have been very frequent, and they have promoted each other. If divided by era, the so-called Early Classical School, Classical School, Romantic School, Impressionist School, etc., their influence has never been limited to a certain country. But this has not eliminated the national characteristics of various countries, and the more it develops later, the more national music develops. The so-called masters of national music, such as the Russian Five, Norway's Grieg, Poland's Chopin, France's Debussy, Czechoslovakia's Smetana and Dvorak, etc., are all great figures of the late nineteenth century.

    During the Sui and Tang Dynasties in China, a large amount of foreign music was introduced into China, which had a great impact on China.

    Mr. Yang Yinliu's "Outline of Chinese Music History," Section 253, says: "The Yan music of the Tang Dynasty is a kind of original music between Qing music and Hu music. It is Qing music containing Hu music components, and Hu music containing Qing music components." Unexpectedly, there was also the problem of "mixing Chinese and Western" at that time.

    During the Tang Dynasty, Chinese music was not only influenced by foreign countries, but also influenced foreign countries. To this day, Japan still preserves a part of Chinese music from the Tang Dynasty very preciously, but whether it has changed its appearance is another matter.

    Speaking of this, some people who are enthusiastic about national music already have enough reason to conclude that He Luting is a nihilist of national music. "He Luting believes that national music is produced by exchanges, and there is no national music without exchanges!"

    It should be admitted that the above are all historical facts, not fabrications. Anything in the world is always interconnected and mutually influenced, and national music cannot develop in isolation for a long time without any external influence. However, the formation of a national culture is not a one-day achievement, but a long-term process that began in the primitive tribal period. I also talked about the formation process of folk songs earlier, and the same is true for local operas. They are all collective creations of the people over many eras, and from the beginning, they have been inseparable from the local people's language, customs, habits, natural environment, economic life, etc. For many years, they have been connected to the thoughts and feelings of the people of the nation, thus forming a special national style unique to the local nation. This special style continues to develop and improve with the forward development of the people's economic and cultural life. At the same time, it may also be influenced by foreign cultures through cultural exchanges with other nations, thus adding some foreign elements to its own national style; however, the music of its own nation will still inevitably occupy a dominant position, and will inevitably continue to live very tenaciously and persistently. People may also accept foreign folk music completely, but just like their own folk songs, in the long historical process, people will inevitably constantly modify or develop it according to their own preferences. A foreign folk song often becomes unrecognizable after many years.

    When foreign music and one's own national music first come into contact, contradictions will inevitably arise. This is an inevitable phenomenon, and it is natural that crude and immature works will be produced. However, after a certain period of time, foreign elements will inevitably be digested and dissolved, and finally merged into the river of national music, disappearing its foreign influence. Now it is impossible to tell which are foreign and which are originally our own in our local national music. Even in terms of musical instruments such as the huqin, pipa, and suona, although they still retain foreign names, people have long regarded them as their own musical instruments. Even the musical instruments themselves have undergone countless processing and modifications to suit the needs of their own nation, so that they have become truly authentic Chinese national musical instruments that no other country has.

    III

    In the past hundreds of years, in Europe, in the process of moving from feudal society to capitalist society, there has been an unprecedented leap forward in science and culture, thus forming a huge force and expanding to other backward regions of the world. At that time, the Qing Dynasty in China was still arrogant and closed off; but after the Eight-Power Allied Forces, it had to kowtow to foreign countries and seek peace, and cede its sovereignty and humiliate the country. This is the painful lesson of our history in adhering to backwardness. After liberation, under the call of the Party, the people of the whole country marched towards science. Coupled with the superior conditions at home and abroad, our speed of progress and achievements are astonishing; but the overall cultural level is still not high. We certainly cannot underestimate ourselves, but we cannot be arrogant and complacent either. If we get a little proud, we will become hotheaded, and it will be ourselves who suffer.

    In terms of music and art, European music has achieved a high level in the past hundreds of years with the development of capitalist society. European music has also poured into China like the tide with other modern cultures, thus inevitably producing mutual exchanges and mutual influences, and also producing mutual contradictions. Therefore, our Chinese music and art are currently entering a huge turbulent era that has never been seen in history. On the one hand, we have the vast and rich musical and cultural heritage of our motherland accumulated over thousands of years, with its own high artistic level of creation and performance, and its own unique national style. At the same time, foreign modern European music, its scientific achievements and artistic creations, are completely new things, thus creating sharp contradictions and intense long-term debates. Such as the debate between foreign and indigenous, the debate between science and backwardness, etc., from professional to amateur to non-musical people have been involved in this debate.

    In the debate, there is no one who completely denies their own national music, at least not verbally, but do all people truly understand and truly love their own national music in their hearts? It should be admitted that there are such people who have specialized in Western music since childhood, and do not come into contact with or understand their own national music, so they think that China has no music, and what they have are all backward things. If they do not understand their own national music at all, then there is even less to talk about feelings.

    But on the other hand, there are also some enthusiastic and narrow-minded national exclusionists who are repulsed by anything foreign. Now is the time to promote national music, and no matter how you scold the foreign, no one dares to fight back anyway, but for our own national music, regardless of whether it is good or bad, it is all said to be scientific, and no one dares to stand up and argue. Some people say: "Those in power now are some Western musicians. They all talk about national music verbally, but in fact, they are using the guise of enriching national music to eliminate national music." "They are eliminating national music under the guise of improving and promoting it." Others say: "How many percent of this music week is foreign and how many percent is indigenous?" What is called national? Only those who use "local voices" and "national musical instruments" can be considered national. Everything else is foreign. Therefore, some people think that this music week is a case of foreign overpowering indigenous, which is a matter of principle. In fact, the officially performed programs are all original works by Chinese people. Although there are many immature works, everyone is subjectively striving to pursue national style. Therefore, I would like to advise comrades who are enthusiastic about the cause of national music to speak with moderation. Unrealistic remarks will hurt the enthusiasm of all music workers.

    We really lack cultivated theorists and cultivated composers, and I myself feel deeply ashamed. At present, everyone seems to be accustomed to half-knowledge, jumping into action, talking endlessly, and reaching no consensus. Even if someone comes out and says something reasonable, they may be shot down in a hail of bullets. Therefore, even some more cultivated theorists have to protect themselves and keep their mouths shut. As a result, theoretical work has long remained in a backward state.

    In terms of composition, it can be seen in this music week that there are many excellent works, and at the same time, many talented young composers have emerged. We should give full encouragement and cultivation to these new forces. This is a good thing. On the other hand, we have many comrades who have a certain understanding of Western modern composition techniques, but do not study their own national music enough, and are not deeply infected by the life atmosphere of the new Chinese people. In particular, they do not have enough time and enthusiasm for creation on weekdays, so their creations have certain limitations. At the same time, there are also comrades who have a good understanding of national music, but have a poor grasp of modern Western composition techniques, and may not have worked hard in this area themselves, so it is difficult to fully exert their creative talents. Of course, there may also be another type of comrade who does not have deep contact with national music, and only touches the edge of composition techniques, but works very hard in creation. Inevitably, there will be some half-baked products. Two half-bottles of vinegar combined are still one bottle of vinegar. They rigidly move some foreign dogmas to piece together, no wonder people scold us for being neither Chinese nor Western, and for mixing Chinese and Western. But then again, we cannot cultivate a large number of cultivated composers overnight. Therefore, although we do not study enough, we must create and learn at the same time. The question is whether we can learn more humbly from the folk and consider our own works more carefully. In this music week, some phenomena are worthy of our attention. Some folk songs adapted into choruses are not as good as the original folk songs, and some folk songs adapted by music workers are not as good as those adapted by the folk themselves. What is the reason? The problem is that we take the adaptation of folk songs too lightly. We have not deeply understood the special style of each folk song, grasped its material and development laws, and its flesh-and-blood connection with the lives of the people. It is impossible to adapt it to be more in line with the taste of the people. As a result, not only will it not strengthen its effect, but it will destroy its original style. Of course, it is impossible for the adapted folk songs to be exactly the same as the original folk songs. There must be some changes and developments. Our goal should be to make the adapted folk songs more beautiful than the original folk songs, not more devoid of folk song flavor. This requires higher skills and a deeper understanding of folk songs, and then it is possible to exert the composer's higher creative talents and create excellent works.

    In the past hundreds of years, European music has developed from simple folk tunes and religious hymns into art songs, various choruses, and even large choruses and grand operas. In terms of instrumental music, it has also developed into various forms of solo, ensemble, chamber music, and even large-scale and complex symphonies. Many great composers have emerged, creating many great works. At the same time, in composition theory, a series of composition technique theories have been formed from the analysis of the works of great composers, such as harmony, counterpoint, form, instrumentation, etc. In terms of musical instrument manufacturing, it has also developed from simple folk instruments into various complex orchestral instruments, with various different and rich timbre changes, beautiful sound quality, and able to meet the expressive requirements of various different volume changes, and able to overcome various complex performance technique changes. All this is due to the huge development of European science and culture in the past hundreds of years. Due to our long-term stagnation in feudal society and later in semi-feudal and semi-colonial social and economic conditions, science and culture are very backward. In terms of music, although we have a rich national music heritage that cannot be compared by any country in the world, we have not produced great composers like Mozart, Beethoven, Tchaikovsky, Chopin, etc., nor do we have our own complete theoretical system of composition, nor do we have our own educational system and professional schools for training professional musical talents, and even the notation method is extremely inaccurate. In terms of musical instruments, although we also have various different and rich timbre changes, they are generally the original folk instruments, and have not been processed and improved by many musical instrument manufacturing experts like modern European instruments. Our musical instruments are generally inaccurate in sound, narrow in range, and lack low-pitched instruments. All these are our backward areas. If we do not admit our backwardness in this regard and refuse to learn from others, it will be ourselves who suffer.

    In recent decades, especially since the May Fourth Movement, after learning Western musical science and technology, we have made some preliminary attempts and achievements in the creation of new national music that expresses modern ideas, especially in the past few years after liberation, there has been rapid development, but there are shortcomings in learning, the purpose is not clear, and the learning is still very insufficient, and most music workers are groping on their own without strict training. Due to the above reasons, it is impossible not to make mistakes in the work.

    The purpose of learning Western musical science and technology is to develop our own modern musical culture. Therefore, we must first consider the Sinicization of Western musical science and technology. Some things, such as notation, we can completely adopt; all Western musical instruments can play Chinese music, so we can completely adopt them; and we can refer to the performance of these instruments to transform our own national musical instruments. Regarding the theoretical techniques of composition such as harmony and counterpoint, some have commonality in principle, but when it comes to the part of national style, we must find our own way; the Sinicization of techniques such as harmony and counterpoint is a very important scientific research work for Chinese composers and music theorists, and some people are already conducting research, which is good. I think this is also a long-term exploration work, which cannot be completely successful in one or two years. In terms of form, the general principles are roughly the same, such as our "beginning, development, transition, and conclusion" is exactly the same as "A, A, B, A". They have developed from a simple ternary form into complex forms such as fugues and sonatas. "Form" is a kind of material in musical structure, like the quatrains and regulated verses of Tang poetry, and the chapter-back novels. The same sonata and fugue material can be used to write works of various national styles. Some of us have also tried to write Chinese-style fugues and sonatas. I think we can also study the structure and development laws of forms in our own national music, and refer to other people's principles to create new structural forms suitable for our own needs.

    Our purpose of learning from the West is to learn from their achievements in musical science and technology, refer to their experience and laws to explore our own laws, build our own theoretical system, create our own modern musical culture, and promote the national style unique to our nation, rather than deliberately imitating them, or rigidly moving some foreign dogmas to transform our national music, so as to lose or destroy the characteristics of our own nation. Or replace our own style of music with foreign music. If our learning leads to such a result, then it is the failure of our learning.

    But national music is developing, not static, especially after we have learned some new composition techniques and created some new national-style musical works, played with new instruments, although the style is completely Chinese, it must be completely different from the original folk instruments.

    In our national tunes, there are many good things that are still useful now, but there are also some things that are no longer applicable and are rigid. We must make choices. At the same time, since the May Fourth Movement, in the revolutionary struggles in our country in various periods, we need songs that can inspire the revolutionary struggle emotions of the military and civilians. This is not easy to find in the original music tunes. If we examine the revolutionary songs of the Jiangxi Soviet area, we can find that the sources of these songs are mainly local folk songs, Japanese military songs, and Soviet revolutionary songs, among which there are also original revolutionary songs similar to foreign styles. After the Anti-Japanese War, the singing movement rose, and anti-Japanese songs sprung up like mushrooms. These songs also have a completely national style, but most of them have a march form, and the tunes have some foreign modern elements. "The March of the Volunteers" is an example. If we analyze the songs of the above periods, pure folk songs such as "Sending Lang to Join the Red Army" are very intimate to sing, and there are also some very light, lively, and cheerful songs. But in our experience, except for a few Shaanxi folk songs, it is not enough to use folk songs to encourage the fighting emotions of soldiers. The Internationale, the Young Pioneers, or other Soviet revolutionary songs are different. Therefore, I think that in the great socialist revolution period in our country, it is natural that many revolutionary songs entered the Chinese mainland with revolutionary ideas and were loved by the vast revolutionary youth, and it is also natural that these tonal elements more or less appeared in our creations and were loved by people. I think the emergence of these few foreign elements only adds some new colors to our national music, and it is impossible to affect our own original national music. This situation is similar to the Sui and Tang Dynasties in our history.

    IV

    There are also many debates about the issue of national orchestras and symphony orchestras. Some people say "Chinese and Western coexist, with national as the main," as if that means Chinese and Western orchestras can coexist, and national orchestras should be the main. In terms of popularization, I think we should pay special attention to the organization and cultivation of national orchestras. Because national musical instruments are mostly simple, easy to master, and familiar to the people; they are cheap and easy to buy, so it is not difficult to organize such orchestras. Generally, factories, rural areas, and schools have the conditions to organize amateur orchestras. We should call on many composers to write songs for such orchestras, but it should still be based on the original instrumental music, and the adaptation of the music should not be too complicated, especially to maintain the original style. I think the Ministry of Light Industry should organize some experts to investigate and study all national orchestral instruments, first of all, to be able to standardize the specifications, determine the fixed pitch of various national musical instruments, and manufacture various national wind instruments with accurate pronunciation. First, we must solve the above problems before we can talk about the improvement of other instruments.

    The Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries are all working hard to organize their own national orchestras and are constantly improving their instruments. The national orchestra of the Uzbek Republic of the Soviet Union not only plays its own national music, but also can play complex symphony orchestra music such as Grieg's Peer Gynt Suite. It is conceivable that their national musical instrument performance and playing skills have developed to a considerable level. At present, we also have some professional national orchestras, but our instrument improvement work has just begun, and the limitations in instrument performance are very large. Therefore, it will be very difficult to play slightly more complex music. Our national musical instruments have many changes in timbre and can be developed into national orchestras that not only have a high level of performance, but also maintain the various timbres unique to our national musical instruments. But this is not a one-day achievement, and there must be a group of people who are determined to bury themselves in instrument reform, instrument playing skills, instrument arrangement, music adaptation and processing, etc., and work hard to study in order to achieve something. We still have the conditions for this work and should actively do it.

    At present, all countries have their own national musical instruments and national orchestras, but pianos, violins, and symphony orchestras are available in any civilized country. These instruments are also developed from national musical instruments. They are a collection of the best musical instruments of various nations, which have been refined and improved through long-term and precise research, becoming the most excellent orchestral bands with international characteristics. This orchestral instrument formation also includes gongs and cymbals from China. In addition to some percussion instruments, each instrument has its extremely complex skills, and the performer must undergo long-term professional training. It has an extremely high level of performance and can play any difficult music, and can also play music of any national style. Because modern musical instruments have developed to a very high level, then there are conditions to create various solo, ensemble, chamber music, symphony, large chorus, grand opera and other large-scale musical works, creating the richest and most valuable musical art wealth for all mankind, and can use musical images to highly concentrate and profoundly express human thoughts and feelings. Therefore, the main works of any of the greatest national music masters in Europe are played by the most advanced modern instruments such as symphony orchestras, pianos, and violins.

    From the above facts, it can be seen that, as far as the current situation is concerned, the difference in musical performance ability between symphony orchestras and our own current national orchestras is very large. Orchestral bands can not only play foreign works, but also pure Chinese-style works. The national-style works we create with this orchestral form can be performed not only in China, but also all over the world. Therefore, the symphony orchestra is one of the directions we are working hard to develop. It has an extremely important role in the development of our own national music culture. We cannot reject it because it is foreign. At the same time, due to the above-mentioned favorable conditions of the national orchestra, we must also actively promote its improvement. Symphony orchestras and national orchestras are two different types of orchestras, and they cannot and should not squeeze each other out. Because the conditions required for symphony orchestras are very high in all aspects, it is impossible to develop them quickly, so national orchestras cannot be affected by the development of symphony orchestras. We must not only have outstanding professional national orchestral bands, but also cultivate outstanding national musical instrument solo experts.

    V

    There are many types of local operas, and the history, skills, level, etc. of each opera are very different, but it is not a simple matter to form an opera and maintain its certain style. When a music worker arrives at the troupe, seeing that many of them are illiterate and have no culture, and that they can do anything in any aspect, they often easily develop the idea of ​​despising them, without considering how much stuff they have and how much ability they have. And each of the other party has been working for ten to dozens of years, with hundreds or thousands of years of tradition, and how many audiences support them. For music workers to reform opera, they should regard their work as extremely serious work. Many music workers do not have enough modern music knowledge and composition techniques. Moreover, modern Western composition techniques and local opera music are two things that have never met, and if you are not careful, you will make the mistake of subjectivism, either rigidly moving dogmas or completely negating everything. Music workers do not have deep contact with national music. When it comes to music cultivation in this area, they are far worse than opera performers. Therefore, when participating in this work, they should first humbly learn from the artists, fully familiarize themselves with and master its laws and style, analyze its advantages and disadvantages, and then it is possible to consider improvement work in close cooperation with the artists. A truly competent opera reform music worker, in addition to deeply studying local opera music, must constantly work hard to learn business and constantly exercise and improve their technical level in combination with opera music work. Local opera is a comprehensive art, so music workers must have the necessary basic cultivation in literature, drama, dance, art, politics, etc.

    It is right for music workers to humbly learn from artists and cooperate with them, but the problem is two-sided, and they should learn from each other and respect each other. If there are no achievements in opera reform work, sometimes you cannot blame the music workers entirely. If the director or opera actor is complacent, arrogant, and looks down on the music workers, the work cannot be done. We must prevent crude phenomena from occurring in opera reform work, but we must also oppose conservatism. We must cherish even the slightest achievements in our opera reform work. The work of opera music reformers is also difficult, and they also need to be encouraged and helped. Excessive criticism and accusations will lose their confidence and enthusiasm.

    Local opera performers were oppressed in the old society, and the old society made them have no opportunity to learn culture, but now they are artists respected by the people. They should work hard to improve culture and learn general modern music knowledge, at least be able to read music. This will not only more effectively sort out their own national music, but also play a greater role in reforming local opera and creating new folk song and dance dramas.

    Regarding the issue of training opera actors, there are many good methods for training and training actors in the past opera classes, which should be retained; but the bad, physiological, or superstitious methods should also be criticized. They should be trained with the standard of cultivating artists with a modern ideological level and a high level of artistic cultivation. In terms of music, in addition to inheriting their own national music and acquiring high skills, they must also master general modern music knowledge. Using modern music knowledge and training methods can master the original national music more quickly. For example, training and improving the ability to read music and listen to sounds, etc. If the training of opera actors is done in the same old way without paying attention to these progressive measures, then it is just as Comrade Sha Mei said: "It is to cultivate the second generation of opera reform objects." This should be paid special attention to by comrades in charge of training the second generation of opera actors.

    VI

    We lack cultivated music theorists and composers too much. Therefore, I naturally think of Mr. Lu Xun again. I read his "The True Story of Ah Q" once twenty years ago, but it seems that the impression is still very fresh until now. I remember that there were many new novels at that time, although they were written about Chinese things, they looked like reading translated novels, and even the sentences were Westernized. But from "The True Story of Ah Q," not only do we have a deep impression of Ah Q's character and the background of the times, but we also seem to be in the scene, seeing with our own eyes Ah Q fighting with others, and a curved shadow shining on the wall. "The True Story of Ah Q" is a genuine Chinese novel. In the novel, people smell the strong smell of Chinese soil. But it is neither the same as any foreign novel nor the same as "Dream of the Red Chamber" and "Water Margin". Why can he write so deeply? The only reason is that he has a very high level of cultivation in both his own national literature and foreign literature. Knowing more, the vision will be wider, and seeing problems and observing things will be more thorough. The writing will naturally be extraordinary.

    Why do we always argue about some simple problems and can't figure them out? Why haven't we seen works with the level of "The True Story of Ah Q" in music creation? We lack cultivated theorists too much, and we lack cultivated composers too much! We must work together to improve the academic research atmosphere in our music circles and cultivate more truly cultivated music theorists and composers. How can we better sort out and promote our national music heritage? It also depends on more and more cultivated music theorists. Chairman Mao said that the new literature and art should be national, scientific, and popular, but we often think of the popular and forget the scientific, and think of the scientific and forget the national. Our thoughts are always very one-sided. What is the reason? It's just that we don't have knowledge and our vision is too narrow.

    民族音乐问题

    一
    民歌和民间音乐是各民族劳动人民的集体创作，每一首民歌都曾经过历代无数的人民根据他们自己的喜爱而修改或加工过的。它有顽强的生命力，它有自己民族所特有的强烈的特色，它是各民族的劳动人民在斗争、劳动和日常生活中所感受到的生活印象的结晶。每一个民族，由于气候、地理、风俗、习惯、经济、政治等等情况的不同而形成不同的民族特性。这种特性也生动地表现在它们的民族音乐中，而成为所有伟大的现实主义作曲家最丰富的创作源泉。
    我们中国是多民族的国家，有数千年历史，六亿人口，幅员广大，因之在全国各地民间所蕴藏的民间音乐之丰富，世界上没有任何国家可以和它相比拟。
    我们民族音乐遗产主要是在两方面：一方面是各地的民歌民谣，另一方面是地方戏曲，包括曲艺在内。此外还有民间乐队及乐器独奏乐曲，包括古琴及筝在内。
    在我们祖国民间音乐的海洋里蕴藏着无尽的珍珠宝贝一样的民歌，它们有顽强的生命力，一代一代留传下来，永远活在人民的心里和口头上，它抒写着深深地埋在人民心底的心事，流露着人民纯洁而真实的感情，人民可以从民歌里得到安慰，得到鼓励和快乐。因之人民从心底里爱它，不断地磨炼它，愈磨愈光彩，以致任何大作曲家的作品都不能和民歌相比拟，相反地他们必须向民歌学习，才能有所成就。难怪格林卡说，真正创作的是人民，作曲家不过作了一些改编工作。
    我想大家也熟悉像“很久很久以前”，“最后之玫瑰”等外国民歌，但是从来没有一首外国民歌像我们自己的民歌那样深刻地感动过我。从民歌里不但可以使我们想起祖国的山河，并且想到遥远的古代。这次音乐周中蒙古族歌手哈扎布的歌声使人想起无边的蒙古草原。从甘肃的“花儿”的音调中我们仿佛真的体会到有悠久历史的黄河上游人民的生活和自然景色。云南民歌使我们想起美丽的西南山国。一首迷人的四川民歌“大河涨水沙浪沙”，引起我无限的怀念和幻想，我仿佛亲眼看见了嘉陵江河谷两岸千年来人民的生活，那陡峭的青山，清彻的激流，甚至水底的鱼群和沙汀。把这些优美的民歌和有些公式化的创作歌曲比起来，简直是天仙比癞蛤蟆。这一点应该引起我们所有作曲家的注意。
    作曲家的创作源泉来自民间，但他的创作加工比较多，复杂一些，不可能代替民间的创作。民间有他自己悠久的传统，也不一定能很快地接受作曲家的作品，除非他的作品真正能保持民歌所特有的朴素、优美、感情真实等优点。像苏联查哈罗夫的作品，农民把它的歌就算作了自己的民歌。
    目前有许多人谈抢救民族音乐问题，我认为民族音乐的收集整理工作作得不少，也还应该更加强；但更重要的还是如何设法使这些仍旧活在人民的心上和口头的民歌能继续活下去，发展下去，使民间自己的花朵开得更加茂盛。这首先要依靠各地的区乡干部和省县及乡村文教工作负责同志们注意和热心提倡。有许多地方认为唱民歌及演奏民间乐器是妨碍生产，下令禁止。民间艺人被认为是二流子，有许多人把乐器藏起来不干了，特别是盲艺人处境更不好。几年以前，发现了一个瞎子阿丙，为他录了音、记了谱，但是人死了，大家觉得很可惜。殊不知在中国广大农村中不知有多少活的瞎子阿丙，在过着困苦的生活，无人过问，埋藏在他们记忆里的许多民间音乐珍宝也被湮没了。
    农村生活现在比从前好得多了。农民很自然地需要文化娱乐，只要各级地方政府文教干部注意提倡，爱护这些民间艺人，关心他们的生活，经常举行民歌竞赛晚会或民间音乐小型的会演，不但可以丰富人民的生活，而且也可以使已有的民歌及民间音乐得到保存和发展。
    地方戏曲的种类，每省多则四五种，少则二三种。它们的差别主要是在它们的音乐，每一个剧种的音乐都有它的独特风格和强烈的地方色彩。地方戏曲包括曲艺在内，也都是经过多少年代，多少无名的音乐家加工磨炼的结果，它和民歌不同的地方是在于它是一种更专业化的集体表演形式。地方戏曲也是我们丰富的民族音乐遗产中的珍宝，还没有看见世界上任何国家有这样多这样丰富的戏剧和音乐相结合的民间艺术表演形式。音乐在发挥戏剧效果，描绘人物性格，音乐和语言的结合以及演唱和演奏等等方面，无论在技巧上和艺术上的成就都达到了很高的水平。
    二
    马克思主义认为人是社会的动物，认为世界上任何事物都不是孤立地存在的，从来就是互相关连，互相影响的。所谓“民族”，并不是种族，而是由长期历史所形成的人们的共同体。构成一个民族的要素是共同的地域，共同的语言，共同的经济关系，共同的心理素质，即民族特性，这种特性表现在音乐中就是为该民族所特有的民族音乐风格。
    民族音乐和民族本身一样，也是长期历史所形成的。但它并不是孤立地发展的。世界上自从有了文化，必然有交流。近三四百年来，欧洲音乐文化交流很频繁，发生了相互促进的作用，假如从时代划分的话，所谓前期古典派、古典派、浪漫派、印象派等等，其影响从来就不是限于某一国家。但是并未因此而消灭了各国的民族特性，并且愈到后来民族音乐愈发展，所谓民族音乐的大师们，如俄罗斯的五人团，挪威的格里格，波兰的萧邦，法国的德比西，捷克斯洛伐克的斯美塔那、德沃夏克等等都是十九世纪后期的伟大人物。
    我国隋唐时代，大量外族音乐传入中国，在中国起了很大的影响。
    杨荫浏先生的“中国音乐史纲”第二五三节说：“唐人的燕乐，是清乐与胡乐之间的一种创作音乐，是含有胡乐成份的清乐，含有清乐成份的胡乐”。想不到当时也有“中西混杂”的问题。
    唐代中国音乐不但受了外国的影响，也影响外国，至今日本还很珍贵地保存了一部分唐代中国的音乐，不过是否变了样那又是另一问题。
    讲到这里，某些热心于民族音乐的人们已经有足够的理由可以断定贺绿汀是一个民族音乐的虚无主义者，“贺绿汀认为民族音乐是交流产生的，没有交流就没有民族音乐！”
    应该承认上面所举的都是一些历史上的事实，并不是捏造的。世界上的任何事物从来就是互相关连互相影响的，民族音乐也不可能不受任何外在的影响而孤立地长期发展。但是一个民族文化的形成不是一朝一夕之功，而是在原始部落时期就已经开始了的长期的过程。前面我也谈过民歌形成的过程，地方戏曲也是一样，都是多少年代的人民的集体创作，从开始起就和当地人民的语言、风俗、习惯、自然环境、经济生活等等分不开的。多少年来就和本民族人民的思想感情血肉相连，因而形成具有当地民族所独有的特殊民族风格。这种特殊风格随着人民的经济文化生活的向前发展也不断地得到发展和改善。同时也可能和其他民族的文化交流而受到外来的影响，因而在自己民族风格中增加一些外来的因素；但是自己本民族的音乐仍旧必然地占统治地位，必然地仍旧十分顽强而持久地活下去。人民也有可能把外来的民间音乐源源本本地接受过来，但是也好像对自己的民歌一样，在长期的历史过程中，人民必然会根据他们自己的爱好，不断地加以修改或发展，一首外来的民歌，经过若干年之后往往可能成为面目全非。
    外来音乐和自己民族音乐开始接触时必定会产生矛盾，这是不可免的现象，因而产生出生硬的不成熟的作品也是当然的。但是经过一定的时间，外来的因素必然会被消化被溶解，最后汇合在民族音乐的河流中而消失其外来的影响。现在在我们各地的民族音乐中已分不出哪些是外来的，哪些是自己原来的，甚至在乐器方面如胡琴、琵琶、唢呐等等，虽然至今尚保持外来的名字，但是人们久已把它们当作自己的乐器了。连乐器本身，为了适合自己民族的要求，也不知经过多少的加工和修改，以致成为任何别的国家都没有的真正地道的中国民族乐器了。
    三
    近数百年来，在欧洲从封建社会走进资本主义社会的过程中，在科学文化方面有着空前巨大的跃进，因而形成巨大的力量，向世界其他的落后地区扩张。而中国当时的清皇朝，还在妄自尊大，闭关自守；但是到了八国联军之后，又不得不媚外求和，丧权辱国，这是我们历史上坚持落后的惨痛教训。解放以后，全国人民在党的号召下向科学进军，再加上国内外优越的条件，我们进展的速度和成就之大是惊人的；可是整个文化水平还是不高的。我们固然不能妄自菲薄，但也不能骄傲自满，稍一得志，头脑就发起热来，吃亏的还是我们自己。
    在音乐艺术方面，欧洲音乐近数百年来随着资本主义社会的发展，已有了很高的成就。欧洲音乐也随着其他的现代文化潮水似的涌进中国来了，因而必然会产生互相交流，互相影响，也要产生互相矛盾的现象。因此我们中国音乐艺术目前是走进了一个历史上从来没有过的巨大的动乱时代。一方面有我们数千年积累下来的浩如湮海的丰富的祖国的音乐文化遗产，有它自己高度的艺术水平的创作和表演，有它自己独特民族风格。同时外来的现代欧洲音乐，它在科学上的成就和艺术创造，又完全是个新的东西，于是就产生了尖锐的矛盾，产生了激烈的长期的争论。如洋土的争论，科学和落后的争论等等，从专业的业余的一直到非音乐界人士都卷入了这场争论。
    在争论中，完全否定自己民族音乐的人，至少在口头上没有，但是是不是所有的人在内心里都真正了解、真正喜爱自己的民族音乐呢？应该承认有这样的人，从小就专门学习西洋音乐，对自己民族音乐不接触不了解，于是就认为中国没有音乐，有的都是些落后的东西。对于自己的民族音乐根本不了解，那就更谈不上感情了。
    但是在另一方面，也有那么一些热心的狭隘的民族排外主义者，一听见洋的就反感。现在是提倡民族音乐的时候，骂洋的无论如何骂法反正没有人敢回手，而对自己的民族音乐则不分青红皂白一律说是科学的，也没有人敢于起来争辩。有人说：“现在当权的都是一些洋音乐家，他们口头上都谈民族音乐，实际上是在丰富民族音乐的幌子下来使民族音乐消灭”，“在提高和推广之下消灭民族音乐”。又有人说：“这次音乐周几分之几是洋的，几分之几是土的”，什么叫民族的呢？凡属用“土嗓子”用“民族乐器”的，才能算是民族的，此外都是洋的，因此有人认为此次音乐周是洋的压倒土的，是原则问题。其实正式演出的节目都是中国人自己的创作，虽然也有很多不成熟的作品，但是大家在主观上都是努力在追求民族风格。因此我想奉劝热心于民族音乐事业的同志们，讲话最好还是要有分寸，不切实际的言辞会伤害所有音乐工作者的积极性的。
    我们实在太缺少有修养的理论家和有修养的作曲家，我自己也深深感到惭愧。目前大家好像都习惯于一知半解，走马上阵，侃侃而谈，莫衷一是，纵或有人出来讲些有道理的话，也可能被乱枪杀得落花流水，因此虽然有些较有修养的理论家，也就只好明哲保身，守口如瓶。于是理论工作就长期停留在落后状态。
    作曲方面，在这一次音乐周上可以看出，有不少优秀的作品，同时出现了不少有才能的年青的作曲家，我们对这些新生的力量应该给以充分的鼓励和培养。这是好的方面。在另一方面，我们有不少对西洋现代作曲技巧有一定修养的同志，对自己民族音乐钻研得不够，对新中国人民的生活气息的感染也不够深，特别是平日创作的时间和积极性都不够，因而表现在创作上有一定的局限性。同时也有对民族音乐很有修养的同志，但是对现代西洋作曲技巧掌握得太差，自己在这方面可能也没有努力过，因而也就很难充分发挥他的创作才能。当然可能还有另一种同志，对民族音乐接触不深，对作曲技巧也只摸了个边，但是创作倒是很努力，就不免有些夹生饭，两个半瓶醋合起来还是一瓶醋，很生硬地搬用一些外国教条来拼拼凑凑，难怪人家要骂我们不中不西，中西混杂。不过话又说回来，我们不可能在一个晚上就培养出一大批有修养的作曲家来，因之虽然学习得不够，我们还必须边创作边学习，问题是在于我们是否能够更虚心地向民间学习，更小心谨慎地考虑自己的作品。在这次音乐周中，有些现象是值得我们注意的。某些改编成合唱的民歌不如原来的民歌好，某些音乐工作者改编的民歌不如民间自己改编的民歌好。什么原因呢？问题是在于我们把民歌改编工作看得太容易了，我们没有更深入地体会每一首民歌的特殊风格，掌握它的体材和发展的规律，以及它同人民生活的血肉连系，就不可能把它改编得更合人民的口胃。结果就会不但没有加强它的效果，反而破坏了它原来的风格。当然改编民歌不可能同原来的民歌一模一样，必然要有所改变，有所发展，我们的目的应该是改编以后比原来的民歌更优美，而不是更没有民歌味道了。这就需要有更高度的技巧和更深入的对民歌的体会，然后才有可能发挥作曲家更高度的创作才能，创作出出色的作品来。
    欧洲音乐在近数百年来从单纯的民间曲调和宗教圣歌发展成为艺术歌曲，各种合唱曲以至大合唱，大歌剧，在器乐曲方面也已发展成为各种形式的独奏、合奏、室内乐、乃至规模巨大内容复杂的交响乐。出现了许多伟大的作曲家，创作了许多伟大的作品，同时在作曲理论上也从大作曲家们的作品分析中，形成了一系列的作曲技法理论体系，如和声学、对位学、曲体学、乐器学等等。在乐器制造方面也已从简单的民间乐器发展成为各种复杂的管弦乐器，有各种不同的丰富的音色变化，音质优美，能达到各种不同音量变化的表情上的要求，能克服各种复杂的演奏技巧上的变化。这一切都是由于近数百年来欧洲科学文化巨大发展的结果。我们由于长期停留在封建社会及后来的半封建半殖民地的社会经济状况中，科学文化很落后，在音乐方面我们虽然有世界上任何国家都不能比拟的丰富的民族音乐遗产，但是我们没有产生像莫扎特、贝多芬、柴可夫斯基、肖邦等那样伟大作曲家，也没有自己一套完整作曲的理论体系，没有自己的培养音乐专业人材的教育制度和专业学校，连记谱法都是极不准确的。在乐器方面，我们虽然也有各种不同的丰富的音色变化，但是一般都是原来的民间乐器，并没有像欧洲现代乐器那样曾经经过许多乐器制造专家加工改良。我们的乐器一般都是声音不准确，音域很仄，没有低音乐器，这一切都是我们落后的地方，在这方面不承认自己的落后，拒绝向人家学习，吃亏的还是我们自己。
    近数十年来，特别是五四以来，我们在学习西洋音乐科学技术以后，在表现现代思想的新的民族音乐创作方面，都有了些初步的尝试和成就，特别在解放以后数年中有飞跃的发展，但是在学习上有缺点，目的不明确，学习得也还很不够，而且大部分音乐工作者都是自己摸索，没有经过严格训练，由于以上的原因，就不可能在工作中不发生错误。
    学习西洋音乐科学技术的目的，是为了发展我们自己的现代音乐文化，因之首先要考虑西洋音乐科学技术中国化的问题。有些东西，如记谱法，我们完全可以采用；全部西洋乐器都可以演奏中国音乐，因此我们完全可以采用；并且可以参考这些乐器的性能来改造我们自己的民族乐器。关于和声、对位等作曲技术理论，有些在原则上有共通性，但涉及到民族风格的部分就必须我们自己想办法；和声、对位等技术的中国化问题，是中国作曲家、音乐理论家很重要的一门科学研究工作，已经有人在进行研究，这是好的。我想这也是长期的摸索探讨工作，不是一两年可以完全成功的。在曲体学方面，一般原则大致相同，如我们的“起、承、转、合”同“A、A、B、A”完全一样。他们已从简单的三段体发展成为赋格曲、奏鸣曲等复杂形式了，“曲体”是乐曲结构上的一种体材，好像唐诗的绝句和律诗，小说中的章回体等，同是奏鸣曲、赋格曲体材可以写出各种民族风格的作品来。我们也有人尝试写作中国风格的赋格曲和奏鸣曲。我想我们还可以研究我们自己民族音乐中曲体结构和发展的规律，参考别人的原则创造新的适合我们自己需要的各种曲体结构上的形式。
    我们学习西洋的目的是学习他们在音乐科学技术上的成就，参考他们的经验和规律来摸索我们自己的规律，建设我们自己的理论体系，创造我们自己的现代音乐文化，发扬我们民族所特有的民族风格，而不是去刻意模仿他们，或者硬搬一些外国的教条去改造我们的民族音乐，以致丧失或破坏了我们自己民族的特性。或者以外国音乐代替了我们自己风格的音乐。假如我们的学习得到这样的结果的话，那就是我们学习的失败。
    但是民族音乐是发展的，不是一成不变的，特别是我们学习了一些新的作曲技巧，创作出一些新的民族风格的音乐作品，用新的乐器演奏，虽然风格完全是中国的，但一定和原来的民间乐器演奏的完全不相同。
    在我们民族音调中有许多很好的现在还有用的东西，但也有些不适用了的、僵化了的东西。我们必须有所选择。同时，五四以来，我国在各时期的革命斗争中，我们需要鼓舞军民革命斗争情绪的歌曲，这在原有音乐音调中是不容易找到的，假如我们检查江西苏区时代的革命歌曲，我们可以发现这些歌曲的来源主要是当地民歌，日本军歌和苏联革命歌曲，其中也有类似外来风格的创作革命歌曲。抗日战争以后，歌咏运动兴起，抗日歌曲如雨后春笋，这些歌曲也有完全民族风格的，但是大部分都带有进行曲形式，音调上多少带了一些外来的现代因素，“义勇军进行曲”就是一个例子。假如我们分析一下以上各时期的歌曲的话，纯粹的民歌如“送郎当红军”等唱起来很亲切，也还有些很轻松、活泼、愉快的歌曲。但是在我们的经验中，除了少数的陕北民歌以外，用民歌来鼓励士兵的战斗情绪还嫌不够。像国际歌，少年先锋队或其他苏联革命歌曲就有所不同。因此我认为在我国伟大的社会主义革命时期，许多革命歌曲随着革命思想进入中国大陆，为广大的革命青年所喜爱也是很自然的，因而这些音调因素或多或少地出现在我们的创作中而为人们所喜爱也是很自然的。我认为这些少数的外来因素的出现，只是使我们民族音乐中增加一些新的色彩，决不可能使我们自己原来民族音乐受到影响。这情况也和我们历史上隋唐时代有相类似的地方。
    四
    关于民族乐队和交响乐队问题也有许多的争论，有人说“中西并存，民族为主”，仿佛那意思就是中西乐队都可以并存，民族乐队应该是为主。在普及的意义上来讲，我认为应该特别重视民族乐队的组织和培养。因为民族乐器大都比较简单，容易掌握，为人民所熟悉；价钱便宜容易买到，因此要组织这样的乐队不很难，一般工厂农村学校都有条件可以组织业余乐队；应该号召许多作曲家为这样的乐队写曲子，但还是应该以原来的器乐曲为主，乐曲改编也不能过于复杂，特别是要保持原来的风格。我认为轻工业部应该组织一些专家，调查研究所有的民族管弦乐器，首先能够把规格统一起来，确定各种民族乐器的固定音高，制造出发音准确的各种民族管乐器。首先要解决以上问题，然后才能谈其他的乐器的改进工作。
    苏联及人民民主国家都在努力组织自己的民族乐队，并且不断地在改良他们的乐器。苏联乌兹别克共和国的民族乐队不但演奏自己民族乐曲，而且可以演奏像挪威作曲家格里格的皮尔金特组曲那样复杂的交响乐队的乐曲，可以想见他们的民族乐器性能和演奏技巧都已经发展到相当高度的水平了。目前我们也有一些专业的民族乐队，但是我们的乐器改良工作刚才开始，乐器演奏性能方面局限性很大，因而要演奏稍微复杂一点的乐曲就会感到很大的困难。我们的民族乐器在音色上有许多变化，可以发展成为既有高度的演奏水平，又能保持我们民族乐器所特有的各种音色的民族乐队，但这也不是一朝一夕之功，必须有那么一批有心人在乐器改革，乐器演奏技巧，乐器编配，乐曲的改编加工等等方面，长期埋头下功夫去钻研才能有所成就。这方面的工作我们还有条件，而且应该积极去作。
    目前各国都有自己的民族乐器，民族乐队，但是像钢琴、提琴以及交响乐队则任何文明国家都有。这些乐器也是从民族乐器发展起来的，它集合各民族最优秀的乐器加以长期的、精密的研究和改良而成为现在这样带国际性的最优秀的管弦乐队，这种乐队乐器编制中也有来自中国的锣和钗。除一部分打击乐器外，每一种乐器都有它极其复杂的技巧，演奏者必须经过长期的专业训练。它有极高度的演奏水平，能演奏任何艰深的乐曲，也可以演奏任何民族风格的乐曲，由于近代乐器发展到了很高的水平，然后才有条件创作出各种独奏，合奏，室内乐，交响乐，大合唱，大歌剧等等大型音乐作品，为全人类创造最丰富最宝贵的音乐艺术的财富，能够用音乐形象高度集中而又深刻地发抒人类思想感情。因之欧洲任何最伟大的民族音乐大师，主要的作品都是用交响乐队，钢琴、提琴等最进步的现代乐器演奏的。
    从以上事实可以看出，就目前情况看，交响乐队比我们自己现在的民族乐队在音乐演奏能力上差别很大，管弦乐队不但能演奏外国作品，也能演奏纯粹中国风格的作品，我们用这种乐队形式创作出来的民族风格的作品，不但中国能演，而且全世界都能演。因之交响乐队是我们努力发展的方向之一，它对于发展我们自己民族音乐的文化有极其重要的作用，我们不能因为它是外来的而拒之于门外。同时民族乐队由于上述有利的条件，我们也要积极的推广改良，交响乐队和民族乐队是两种不同性质的乐队，不可能也不应该互相排挤。交响乐队由于各方面的条件要求很高，不可能很快地发展起来，所以民族乐队不可能因为交响乐队的发展而受到影响。我们不但要有特出的专业的民族管弦乐队，而且要培养特出的民族乐器独奏专家。
    五
    地方戏曲的种类很多，各剧种的历史久暂、功夫深浅、水平高低等等都有很大的差别，但是形成一种剧种并能保持它一定的风格，那就不是一件简单的事情。音乐工作者一到剧团，看见他们有许多人不识谱又没有文化，而自己在哪方面都能行，往往就很容易产生轻视他们的思想，没有考虑到自己有多少货色，多大本领。而对方每人都是十年到几十年的功夫，几百年上千年的传统，有多少观众拥护他们。对戏曲改革音乐工作者来讲，应该把自己的工作当成极其严肃的工作。许多音乐工作者对现代音乐知识、作曲技术，锻炼不够。况且现代西洋作曲技巧和地方戏曲音乐是两个从来没有碰过头的东西，一不当心就会犯主观主义的毛病，不是硬搬教条就是全盘否定。音乐工作者对民族音乐接触不深，讲起这方面的音乐修养来，自己比戏曲艺人差得远，因之参加这个工作时首先应该虚心向艺人学习，充分熟悉并掌握了它的规律、它的风格，分析它的优点缺点，然后才有可能在和艺人紧密合作之下考虑改进工作。一个真正能胜任的戏曲改革音乐工作者，除了深刻研究地方戏曲音乐以外，必须不断努力学习业务并结合戏曲音乐工作不断地锻炼和提高自己的技术水平。地方戏曲是一种综合的艺术，所以音乐工作者必须在文学、戏剧、舞蹈、美术、政治等等方面都要有必要的基础修养。
    音乐工作者虚心向艺人学习，同他们合作是应该的，但问题是双方面的，应该互相学习，互相尊重。戏曲改革工作没有成绩的话，有时也不能全部怪音乐工作者。导演或戏曲演员假如故步自封、骄傲自满，看不起音乐工作者，工作也就作不下去。我们要防止戏曲改革工作中发生粗暴的现象，但是也要反对保守。要珍惜我们在戏曲改革工作中那怕是最微小的成就。戏曲音乐改革工作者的工作也是艰苦的，他们也需要得到鼓励和帮助。过分的批评和指责就会丧失他们的信心和积极性的。
    地方戏曲艺人在旧社会里是受压迫的，旧社会使他们没有机会学习文化，但现在已经是一个为人民所尊重的艺术家了，应该努力提高文化，学习现代一般音乐知识，起码自己能识谱。这样不但可以更有效地整理自己的民族音乐，而且对改革地方戏曲和创造新的民间歌舞剧也将起更巨大的作用。
    对戏曲演员的培养问题，过去的科班中，有许多很好的培养和训练演员的方法，应该保留下来；但也应该批判其中不好的，违反生理的或带迷信的办法。应该以培养有现代思想水平的，有高度艺术修养的艺术家为标准来培养他们。在音乐方面，除了他们必须继承自己民族音乐，获得高度的技巧以外，还必须掌握现代音乐一般知识，利用现代的音乐知识和训练方法可以更快地掌握原来的民族音乐。譬如训练和提高读谱以及听音的能力等等。训练戏曲演员，如果一成不变地照老法办事，而不去注意以上这些进步的措施的话，那就正如沙梅同志所说的：“是在培养第二代戏改对象”。这一点应该引起培养第二代戏曲演员的负责同志特别注意的。
    六
    我们太缺少有修养的音乐理论家和作曲家了。因此很自然又想起了鲁迅先生，他的“阿Q正传”，我在二十年以前看过一遍，但是一直到现在，仿佛印象还是很新鲜。记得当时有许多新小说，虽然写的是中国的事情，看起来好像是读翻译小说，连句子都是洋化的。但是从“阿Q正传”中，不但使我们对阿Q的人物性格和时代背景有个很深的印象，而且我们仿佛身临其境，亲眼看见阿Q和人家打架，在墙上照起一条弯弯的影子。“阿Q正传”是地道的中国小说，在小说里使人闻到强烈的中国泥土气味。但是他既不同于任何外国小说，也不同于红楼梦、水浒传。为甚么他能够写得如此深刻呢？惟一的原因就是他无论对自己本国文学，对外国文学都有很高的修养。知道得多，眼界就宽了，看问题观察事物就会更加透彻，下起笔来自然就会不同凡响。
    为甚么一些很简单的问题我们总是争来争去闹不清楚呢？我们为甚么在音乐创作上没有出现像文学上的“阿Q正传”那样水平的作品呢？我们太缺少有修养的理论家了，太缺少有修养的作曲家了！我们要共同努力提高我们音乐界的学术研究空气，多培养出一些真正有修养的音乐理论家和作曲家来。如何才能更好地整理和发扬我们的民族音乐遗产呢？也是有赖于更多更有修养的音乐理论家。毛主席说，新的文艺应该是民族的、科学的、大众的，但是我们往往想到大众的忘了科学的，想到了科学的又忘了民族的，我们的思想老是很片面，什么原因呢？只怪我们没有学问，眼光太仄狭了。
