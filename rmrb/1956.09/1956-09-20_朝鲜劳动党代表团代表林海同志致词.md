Dear Comrades,

Entrusted by the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party, I extend warm congratulations to the glorious Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, and through the Congress, to all members of the Communist Party of China and the fraternal Chinese people!

During the period from the Seventh to the Eighth National Congress, the Communist Party of China, guided by Marxism-Leninism, under the leadership of the Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, has achieved brilliant victories in completing the people's democratic revolution, carrying out socialist economic construction, and safeguarding world peace.

Under the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China, 600 million Chinese people have established the People's Republic of China. This is not only a great event in the history of the Chinese people in creating a new life, but also a major international event that has greatly strengthened the power of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. Now, the People's Republic of China has become a powerful fortress in the struggle for peace and democracy in Asia.

Under the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people have fully demonstrated their political enthusiasm, labor enthusiasm, and creativity in the great cause of socialist construction and socialist transformation, achieving brilliant successes in all aspects of the first five-year plan, and continuously improving the material and cultural living standards of the working people; and have developed science, culture, and the arts. This not only demonstrates the face of the new society, but also confirms the superiority of the socialist system.

Under the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China, the international status and prestige of the People's Republic of China have been increasing day by day, due to its efforts to promote the realization of the armistice in Korea and Indochina, and its commitment to establishing peaceful diplomatic relations based on the Five Principles. The role it plays in easing international tensions and maintaining world peace is, like that of the Soviet Union, very significant.

The rapid development of the People's Republic of China makes the true friends of the Chinese people—the people of socialist countries and peace-loving people all over the world—infinitely happy.

The Korean people are proud to have such a strong neighbor as the People's Republic of China, and rejoice in the victories achieved by the Chinese people in building a prosperous motherland as their own victories.

The people of Korea and China have forged a deep friendship in history.

The patriotic people of Korea and China fought side by side in the common struggle against Japanese imperialism. Especially during the Fatherland Liberation War when the Korean people resisted the armed aggression of the American imperialists and the traitorous Syngman Rhee clique, the Chinese people, holding high the banner of resisting American aggression and aiding Korea, sent the Chinese People's Volunteers to the Korean front to fight alongside the Korean People's Army, sharing weal and woe with the Korean people, and directly aided us with their blood.

This has truly set a new example of proletarian internationalism in international friendly relations, and further consolidated and developed the fighting friendship between the Korean and Chinese peoples.

The fighting friendship and unity between the Korean and Chinese peoples ensured the victory of the war against aggression and made a great contribution to the cause of safeguarding the security of Korea and China and consolidating peace in Asia and the world.

Since the armistice, the Chinese people have continued to provide the Korean people with enormous economic and technical assistance in the struggle to restore and develop the national economy.

The brave warriors of the Chinese People's Volunteers and many Chinese technicians directly participated in the work of restoring and building our national economy, demonstrating a high degree of labor enthusiasm.

The sincere internationalist assistance given to the Korean people by the fraternal Chinese people, together with the valuable assistance given to us by the people of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, has become a reliable guarantee for the Korean people to strive for the prosperity and strength of our country, and for the great cause of the peaceful reunification of the motherland.

On behalf of all members of the Korean Workers' Party and all Korean people, I express my deep gratitude to the Communist Party of China, the government of the People's Republic of China, and all the Chinese people, through this Congress, for the sincere assistance of the fraternal Chinese people!

Now, the Korean people, in accordance with the resolutions of the Third Congress of the Korean Workers' Party, are achieving more new successes in the struggle for the peaceful reunification of the motherland and in socialist construction in the northern half of the Republic.

The Korean people have overfulfilled the production tasks of state-owned industry and cooperative industry stipulated in the three-year plan for restoring and developing the national economy by four and a half months ahead of schedule. The total output value of state-owned industry and cooperative industry increased by 96% compared with the production level in 1949 and by 159% compared with 1953.

Our work of rapidly developing agriculture and carrying out the socialist transformation of agriculture is progressing smoothly. The number of peasant households participating in agricultural production cooperatives has reached 70.6% of the total number of peasant households in the northern half of the Republic.

The Fatherland United Front, based on the worker-peasant alliance and including all strata of patriotic democratic forces, has been further expanded. The material and cultural life of the people has also been gradually improved and raised.

All these achievements gained in the northern half of the Republic—the democratic base—are a reliable guarantee for the peaceful reunification of the motherland, and are also a great encouragement to the people in the southern half who are fighting against American imperialism and its running dogs, the Syngman Rhee gang.

However, our motherland is still divided into two parts and has not yet been unified. The people in the southern half of the Republic are still groaning under colonial rule.

The American imperialists and their running dogs, the Syngman Rhee gang, are not reconciled to accepting the lesson of their disastrous defeat in the Korean War, and continue to violate the armistice agreement, and unreasonably reject the fair and reasonable plan for peaceful reunification proposed by the Korean Workers' Party and the Republic government, clamoring for a "northward march war," and frantically plotting to launch another war, exacerbating the tense situation in our country and Asia.

However, the development of the current international and domestic situation is definitely in our favor.

In particular, the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has brought about a new upsurge in the international communist movement and the workers' movement.

The unity and solidarity of the international working class is increasingly strengthened, and the peace movement against warmongers is unfolding in a magnificent way.

Any conspiracy of the enemy that ignores this reality cannot stop the progress of the good people all over the world, nor can it subdue the awakened people of the oppressed countries.

The Korean people are closely united with the people of the strong socialist peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union and China; the Korean people are also consolidated in their political and ideological unity, and they will overcome all difficulties and continue to advance victoriously.

The rich experience of the Chinese revolution summarized by the Eighth National Congress of your Party will become a valuable lesson for our future work.

Finally, I am convinced that the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China will make a great contribution to the further development and consolidation of your Party, to the prosperity and strength of the People's Republic of China, and to the cause of striving for lasting world peace.

Now please allow me to convey the congratulatory message from the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party to your Congress:
Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China:

On behalf of all our members and all the Korean people, the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party extends warm congratulations to the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China.

The Communist Party of China, guided by Marxism-Leninism, has a glorious revolutionary tradition of victoriously leading the arduous and long-term Chinese revolution.

Since the Seventh National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the great Chinese people, under the correct leadership of the Communist Party, have victoriously completed the people's democratic revolution, established the People's Republic of China, and achieved great achievements in socialist construction, while making brilliant contributions in safeguarding peace in Asia and the world.

The growth of the People's Republic of China and the historical victory achieved by the Chinese people demonstrate the great living power and creative spirit of the Chinese people, which has given a decisive blow to the imperialist colonial policy in the East, encouraged the liberation struggle of the oppressed people, and become a great force in the cause of striving for lasting world peace.

Since long ago, the Korean and Chinese people have had traditional friendship; especially during the Korean people's just Fatherland Liberation War, the friendship and unity between the two peoples forged with blood was more consolidated than before. After the armistice, the Chinese people continued to provide the Korean people with material, technical, and spiritual assistance, which has become one of the important guarantees for our victory.

At present, American imperialism occupies South Korea and Taiwan. Although they attempt to create tension in Asia and launch another war, they are doomed to fail in the face of the united force of the Korean and Chinese peoples supported by the people of the strong socialist peace and democracy camp headed by the great Soviet Union.

The Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party wishes the Communist Party of China to further develop and consolidate through this Congress, and to achieve greater achievements in China's socialist construction and the struggle for lasting peace in Asia and the world.

Long live the leading force of the great Chinese people—the Communist Party of China and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China headed by Comrade Mao Zedong!

Long live the unbreakable friendship and unity of the Korean and Chinese people!

Long live the friendship and unity among the people of the socialist camp headed by the great Soviet Union and China!

Korean Workers' Party Central Committee

专栏：

    朝鲜劳动党代表团代表林海同志致词亲爱的同志们：
    我受朝鲜劳动党中央委员会的委托，向光荣的中国共产党第八次代表大会，并通过大会，向中国共产党全体党员和兄弟般的中国人民，致以热烈的祝贺！
    在七大到八大期间，以马克思列宁主义作为自己活动的指南的中国共产党，在毛泽东同志为首的中央委员会的领导下，在完成人民民主革命、进行社会主义经济建设和保卫世界和平的事业中，取得了辉煌的胜利。
    六万万中国人民在中国共产党的正确领导下，建立了中华人民共和国。这不仅是中国人民在创造新生活的历史上的一件伟大的事情，而且也是大大加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营力量的国际大事。现在，中华人民共和国在争取亚洲和平与民主的斗争中已成为强大的堡垒。
    中国人民在中国共产党的正确领导下，进行社会主义建设和社会主义改造的伟大事业中，充分发挥了政治积极性，发挥了劳动热情和创造性，在第一个五年计划的各个方面取得了光辉的成就，不断地提高了劳动人民的物质文化生活水平；并且发展了科学、文化艺术事业。还不仅显示了新社会的面貌，而且证实了社会主义制度的优越性。
    在中国共产党的正确领导下，中华人民共和国由于努力促使朝鲜和印度支那停战的实现，并根据五项原则致力于建立和平外交关系等事业，因而中华人民共和国的国际地位和威望日益提高，在缓和国际紧张局势和维护世界和平的事业中所起的作用，同苏联一样，是非常巨大的。
    中华人民共和国的飞跃发展，使中国人民的真正朋友——社会主义阵营的各国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民无限喜悦。
    朝鲜人民因为有中华人民共和国这样强大的邻邦而感到骄傲，并把中国人民在建设繁荣的祖国方面所取得的胜利当作自己的胜利而欢欣鼓舞。
    朝中两国人民在历史上结成了深厚的友谊。
    朝中两国的爱国志士在反对日本帝国主义的共同斗争中，曾并肩作战，特别是在过去朝鲜人民抗击美帝国主义者和李承晚卖国匪帮武装侵略的祖国解放战争时期，中国人民高举着抗美援朝的旗帜，派中国人民志愿军到朝鲜前线与朝鲜人民军共同作战，与朝鲜人民同甘苦共患难，直接用鲜血援助了我们。
    这在国际友好关系上真正树立了无产阶级国际主义的新的榜样，进一步巩固和发展了朝中人民的战斗友谊。
    朝中两国人民战斗的友谊和团结，保证了反侵略的战争的胜利，并对保卫朝中两国的安全和巩固亚洲和世界和平的事业作出了巨大的贡献。
    在停战以后，中国人民又继续给予朝鲜人民为恢复和发展国民经济的斗争以经济的、技术的巨大援助。
    中国人民志愿军的勇士和许多中国技术人员，直接参加了恢复和建设我国国民经济的工作，发挥了高度的劳动热情。
    兄弟般的中国人民给予朝鲜人民的真诚的国际主义援助，同以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国人民给予我们的宝贵援助一起，对于朝鲜人民争取我国的繁荣和富强，争取祖国和平统一的伟大事业，已成为可靠的保证。
    对于兄弟般的中国人民的真诚援助，我以朝鲜劳动党全体党员和全体朝鲜人民的名义，通过这次大会，向中国共产党、向中华人民共和国政府以及全体中国人民致以深切的谢意！
    现在，朝鲜人民遵照朝鲜劳动党第三次代表大会的决议，在争取祖国和平统一，和在共和国北半部的社会主义建设中，正在取得更多的新的成就。
    朝鲜人民提前四个半月超额完成了恢复和发展国民经济的三年计划中所规定的国营工业和合作社工业的生产任务。国营工业和合作社工业的生产总值，比1949年生产水平增长了96％，比1953年增长了159％。
    我国迅速发展农业和对农业进行社会主义改造的工作正在顺利地进行着，参加农业生产合作社的农户已达共和国北半部农户总数的70.6％。
    以工农联盟为基础的包括各阶层爱国民主力量的祖国统一战线，得到了进一步的扩大。人民的物质文化生活也逐步得到改善和提高。
    在共和国北半部——民主基地所获得的这一切成就，是使祖国走向和平统一的可靠的保证，并且对于为反对美帝国主义及其走狗李承晚匪帮而斗争的南半部人民来说也是巨大的鼓舞。
    但是，我们的祖国仍然被分裂为两部分，目前仍未得到统一，共和国南半部人民仍在殖民统治下呻吟。
    美帝国主义及其走狗李承晚匪帮不甘心接受在朝鲜战争中遭到惨败的教训，继续违反停战协定，并且无理地拒绝朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府提出的公平合理的和平统一的方案，叫嚣“北进战争”，疯狂地阴谋再一次发动战争，加剧了我国和亚洲的紧张局势。
    然而，今天的国际、国内形势的发展，肯定是对我们有利的。
    特别是苏联共产党第二十次代表大会，使国际共产主义运动和工人运动有了新的高涨。
    国际工人阶级的统一和团结日益加强，反对战争贩子的和平运动正在波澜壮阔地展开着。
    无视这一现实的敌人的任何阴谋诡计，也不能阻止全世界善良人民前进，也不能使已经觉醒的被压迫国家人民屈服。
    朝鲜人民同以苏联、中国为首的强大的和平民主社会主义阵营各国人民紧密地团结在一起；朝鲜人民在政治上、思想上也巩固地团结起来了，他们将会克服一切困难，继续胜利前进。
    这次贵党第八次全国代表大会所总结的中国革命的丰富经验，将成为我们今后工作中宝贵的教训。
    最后，我深信，中国共产党第八次代表大会对贵党的进一步发展和巩固，对中华人民共和国的繁荣和富强，以及对争取世界持久和平的事业，将做出巨大的贡献。
    现在请允许我向你们转达朝鲜劳动党中央委员会致贵大会的贺词：中国共产党第八次代表大会：
    朝鲜劳动党中央委员会以我们全体党员和全体朝鲜人民的名义，向中国共产党第八次代表大会致以热烈的祝贺。
    以马克思列宁主义作为自己的行动指南的，中国共产党具有着胜利地领导艰苦而长期的中国革命的光辉的革命传统。
    中国共产党第七次代表大会以来，伟大的中国人民在共产党的正确的领导下，胜利地完成了人民民主革命，建立了中华人民共和国，在社会主义建设中获得了巨大的成就，同时在维护亚洲及世界和平的事业中作出了辉煌的贡献。
    中华人民共和国的成长以及中国人民取得的历史性的胜利，显示了中国人民的伟大的生活力量和创造精神，这在东方给帝国主义的殖民政策以决定性的打击，鼓励了被压迫人民的解放斗争，并且成为争取世界持久和平的事业中的巨大的力量。
    很早以来，朝中人民有着传统的友谊；特别是在朝鲜人民的正义的祖国解放战争时期，两国人民之间以鲜血结成的友谊和团结，比以前更加巩固了。停战以后，中国人民继续给予朝鲜人民的物质、技术及精神的援助，成为我们胜利的重要保证之一。
    目前，美帝国主义霸占着南朝鲜和台湾。尽管它们企图制造亚洲的紧张局势，再次发动战争，但是在受到了以伟大的苏联为首的强大的社会主义和平民主阵营人民所支持的朝中人民的团结力量面前，是注定要失败的。
    朝鲜劳动党中央委员会预祝中国共产党通过这次代表大会更加发展和巩固，并且在中国的社会主义建设和争取亚洲及世界持久和平的斗争中获得更大的成就。
    伟大的中国人民的领导力量——中国共产党和以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党中央委员会万岁！
    朝鲜人民和中国人民的牢不可破的友谊和团结万岁！
    以伟大的苏联和中国为首的社会主义阵营的各国人民之间的友谊和团结万岁！
                朝鲜劳动党中央委员会
                一九五六年九月十六日
