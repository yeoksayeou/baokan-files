Cherish the Time of Engineering and Technical Personnel
Yao Fu

The Reader's Department received a letter from Tangshan saying: "My brother is an engineer at the Kailuan Coal Mine. One day at noon, I brought him a set of fishhooks and fishing line from Beijing. He looked at them and said with a smile: 'I'll use this when I'm sixty and retired!' Why did he say that? It turns out my gift selection was too subjective. My brother goes to work at 5:30 every morning and doesn't return until 12:30 in the afternoon. He goes back to work at 2:30 in the afternoon and doesn't get home until 10:30 at night. He's really out before dawn and home after dark, so much so that he doesn't even have time to watch movies, and he often works overtime on Sundays. Where would he find time to fish!"

People as busy as this engineer are not isolated cases. At an engineer conference held by the Shenyang Bureau of the Ministry of Coal Industry in July this year, it was reported that it is common for key engineering and technical personnel to work twelve or thirteen hours a day. The chief engineer of a mine at the Fuxin Mining Bureau said that in addition to working twelve or thirteen hours a day, he has to work a 24-hour shift once a month and a night shift once a week. He doesn't rest after the night shift and still works the next morning as usual. Sometimes he receives a phone call at his dormitory at night and has to rush to the construction site. A deputy chief engineer at the Fushun Mining Bureau said with emotion: "If this continues, I'll collapse in three to five years; although the country has reserves, it's still a loss!"

It is undeniable that China's socialist economic construction tasks are very heavy, and the burden on engineering and technical personnel is heavy, especially the burden on chief engineers. Many tasks require their participation or even decision-making. Engineering and technical personnel are also happy to do more. However, is the current phenomenon of excessively long working hours for engineering and technical personnel completely reasonable and completely unavoidable? No. Many engineering and technical personnel report that the excessive working hours are largely due to unclear responsibilities. Many things that could be handled without going through them are pushed onto them. The deputy chief engineer of the Fushun Mining Bureau holds eighteen positions, and many meetings from the province and city to the administrative and trade union organizations in the mining area cannot be without him. Moreover, a meeting takes at least half a day, and often several days. He often lives a meeting life and has difficulty managing his own time. Although the Cai Tun Coal Mine of the Benxi Mining Bureau has three or four deputy chief engineers, the chief engineer sometimes can't go home for a month due to being so busy. Some mines also report that receiving inspectors from higher authorities, welcoming intern students, and answering reporters' interviews all require the chief engineer's involvement. Some even look for the chief engineer to get a car to transport materials. Therefore, some people say: "The chief engineer takes on so much work, he's like Wang Xifeng in *Dream of the Red Chamber*."

Key engineering and technical personnel cannot independently control their time and are too busy, so they don't have time to sit down and consider major issues, don't have time to go deep into the field to discover problems, don't have time to collect materials and conduct in-depth research to come up with something worthwhile. They call this situation: "Can't sit down, can't go down, can't collect, can't produce."

The busyness of technical personnel is also related to the incomplete staffing and unreasonable job transfers. Many units do not have a chief mechanical engineer in addition to the chief engineer, and production management and technical management are not unified, so a technical core force cannot be formed. After technical personnel are transferred from some units, the personnel department does not promptly find replacements. Some technical personnel are transferred frequently, sometimes even four times a year, and are transferred again before they even get the hang of a new job. As for grassroots technicians, many do not have a clear responsibility, and the direction of the march towards science is unclear. Some enterprises want to buy some scientific reference books, but the enterprise unit does not have this budget.

The above situation fully shows that the time problem of engineering and technical personnel is a problem that urgently needs to be solved, and it is also a problem that affects all aspects. This is not only the case for engineering and technical personnel in the coal industry system, but also similar phenomena in other departments. For the long-term interests of the country, the Party organizations in various localities, departments, and enterprises need to further understand the suffering of engineering and technical personnel, actively take measures to streamline their meetings, reduce their concurrent positions, and provide them with necessary assistants. In a word: we must cherish their time and energy so that they can strengthen technical leadership and play a greater role in production.

### 珍惜工程技术人员的时间

    珍惜工程技术人员的时间
    药夫
    读者部?从唐山来信说：“我哥哥是开滦煤矿的工程师。一天中午，我把由北京带来的一副鱼钩和鱼线送给他。他看了看笑着说：‘这个东西等我六十岁以后，养老的时候再用吧！’他为什么这样说呢？原来我的礼物选择得太主观了。哥哥每天早晨五时半就上班，中午十二时半才回来，下午二时半又上班，一直到晚十时半才回家。真是披星戴月，弄得他连看电影的时间也没有，星期日也常加班，那有时间钓鱼啊！”
    像这位工程师一样忙乱不堪的人并不是个别的。今年7月煤炭工业部沈阳管理局召开的工程师会议上，据反映，主要负责的工程技术人员每天工作十二、三小时是比较普遍的现象。阜新矿务局有一个矿的总工程师说，他除了每天工作十二、三小时之外，每月要值一次连续二十四小时的班，每星期值一次夜班；值了夜班不休息，第二天上午还照样工作，有时夜间在宿舍里接到电话，也要赶到工地上去。抚顺矿务局一位副总工程师感慨地说：“像这样下去，再有三五年就垮了；虽然国家有后备力量，毕竟是一个损失！”
    不可否认，我国社会主义经济建设的任务非常繁重，工程技术人员的担子很重，特别是总工程师的担子更重，许多工作非他们参加甚至决定不可。工程技术人员们也是乐于做更多的事情的。可是，现在工程技术人员工作时间过长的现象是不是完全合理，完全不可避免的呢？不，许多工程技术人员反映，目前工作时间过长，在相当大的程度上是因为职责不清，许多本来可以不经过他们就可以办的事情，也推到他们头上来，抚顺矿务局副总工程师身兼十八个职务，上到省里市里，下到矿区的行政和工会，许多会都少不了他，而且一开会少则半天，多则几天，经常过着会议生活，难以自由支配时间。本溪矿务局彩屯煤矿虽然有三、四个副总工程师，但是由于忙乱，有时总工程师一个月不能回一次家。还有的矿反映，接待上级检查人员、欢迎实习的学生、答复记者的访问，都要经过总工程师，有的为着要一辆汽车拉材料，也找总工程师。所以有的人说：“总工程师揽事之多，好像红楼梦中的王熙凤。”
    主要工程技术人员对时间的支配不能自主，工作忙乱，就没有时间坐下来考虑重大问题，没有时间深入现场发现问题，没有时间搜集材料，深入研究，拿出一点像样的东西来。他们把这种情况叫作：“坐不下，下不去，搜不来，拿不出。”
    技术人员的忙乱，也和人员配备不全和工作调动的不尽合理有关。许多单位除了总工程师之外，没有总机械师，再加生产管理和技术管理不统一，所以，技术核心力量不能形成。有些单位的技术人员调走以后，人事部门没有及时找人接替，也有些技术人员调动频繁，甚至有的一年调动四次，接了一个新工作还没有摸头就又调走了。至于基层技术员，很多没有一定责任，对向科学进军的方向不明确。有的企业想买些科学参考书，但是企业单位没有这笔预算。
    上述情况充分说明，工程技术人员的时间问题是一个急待解决的问题，同时也是牵动到各个方面的问题。不只煤炭工业系统的工程技术人员是如此，其他部门也有类似现象。为了国家的长远利益，各地、各部门和各个企业的党组织有必要进一步体谅工程技术人员的苦恼，积极采取措施，精简他们的会议，减少他们的兼职，同时要为他们配备必要的助手。一句话：要珍惜他们的时间和精力，以便使他们有可能加强技术领导，在生产上发挥更大的作用。
