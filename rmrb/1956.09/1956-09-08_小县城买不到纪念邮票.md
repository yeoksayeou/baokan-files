    Commemorative Stamps Unavailable in Small County Towns
    I am a stamp collecting enthusiast. I heard that the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications was issuing Capital Scenery Commemorative Stamps nationwide from June 15th, so I excitedly went to the Fengning County Post Office in Hebei to purchase them, but the post office said they didn't have any. At the time, I thought it might be due to inconvenient transportation, and they just hadn't arrived yet. However, when I inquired again three weeks later, they still didn't have them; the comrades at the post office said apologetically, "They probably won't be sent here." This really disappointed me. Why is it that every time commemorative stamps are issued, the newspapers always say they are being issued simultaneously in post offices across the country, but small county towns often don't have them?　Xia Jiahuai

    小县城买不到纪念邮票
    我是一个集邮爱好者。听说邮电部从6月15日起在全国各地发行首都风景纪念邮票，便兴匆匆地跑到河北丰宁县邮局购买，邮局却说没有。我当时以为，可能是因为交通不便，一时发不来。但是，过了三个星期以后再去询问，还是没有；邮局的同志很抱歉地说：“可能不会发来了。”这真使我失望。为什么每次发行纪念邮票，报上总是登载全国各地邮局同时发行，而小县城却往往没有呢？　夏家骅
