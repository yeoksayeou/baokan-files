    Handan Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative of Hebei Province
    Supports Disaster Victims' Production and Self-Help Through Barter

    (Our Newspaper News) This year's disaster situation in Handan Special District, Hebei Province, is severe. In order to do a good job in supplying materials and purchasing local and special products in the disaster areas, the supply and marketing cooperatives in various counties have extensively organized mobile trade teams and adopted a barter trade method to vigorously support disaster victims in production and self-help. All fourteen counties in the special district (except Wu'an County) have organized 235 mobile teams. According to statistics from 36 grassroots cooperatives in JiZe, Yongnian, Qiu County, and Qu Zhou counties on August 20, the supply and marketing cooperatives exchanged daily necessities for more than 36,800 jin of pig iron, more than 13,000 jin of cottonseed, 70 jin of saltpeter, as well as medicinal materials, rags, waste rubber, etc., with a total value of 27,000 yuan.

    JiZe County is rich in medicinal materials. The supply and marketing cooperative of this county printed the varieties, prices, and locations of medicinal materials to be purchased into advertisements and posted them in various villages. At the same time, samples were sent to grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives to facilitate the purchase by each cooperative and the collection by farmers. The Chengguan District Supply and Marketing Cooperative has exchanged necessities such as edible salt, matches, cooking oil, and kerosene for medicinal materials, pig iron, hair, rags, and other items. The eight grassroots cooperatives in Feixiang County organized thirteen mobile teams, carrying a large number of daily necessities needed by the masses, and exchanged them for local and special products with a total value of more than 1,800 yuan.

    These positive measures taken by the supply and marketing cooperatives have strongly supported the production and self-help activities of the people in the disaster areas, which has been welcomed by the people in the disaster areas and inspired their confidence in fighting against the disaster.

    河北省邯郸专区供销合作社
    以换货方式支持灾民生产自救
    本报讯　河北省邯郸专区今年灾情严重。各县供销合作社，为了做好灾区物资供应和收购土特产品的工作，广泛地组织了流动贸易小组，采取换货的贸易方式，大力支持灾民生产自救。全专区十四个县（除武安县以外）已经组织了二百三十五个流动小组。根据鸡泽、永年、丘县、曲周四个县三十六个基层社8月20日统计，供销社用日用品换回生铁三万六千八百多斤、棉籽一万三千多斤、火硝七十斤，还有药材、破布、废胶等，总值二万七千元。
    鸡泽县盛产药材，这个县的供销合作社就把要收购药材的品种、价格、地点印成广告张贴各村，同时把样品发到基层供销社，以便各社收购和农民采集。城关区供销社已用食盐、火柴、食油、煤油等必需品，换回了药材、生铁、头发、破布等等东西。肥乡县的八个基层社组织了十三个流动小组，携带大批群众所需的日用品，换回了总值一千八百多元的土特产。
    供销合作社的这些积极措施，大力支持了灾区人民的生产自救活动，受到了灾区人民的欢迎，鼓舞了他们向灾害斗争的信心。
