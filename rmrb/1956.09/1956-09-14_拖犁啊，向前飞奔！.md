    Sleigh, Rush Forward!
    Gu Gong
    Eight horseshoes kick up snow,
    Pulling the sleigh rushing forward,
    Five Kazakh girls sit on the sleigh,
    Hurrying to the agricultural college to learn new courses.
    They slid down from the Tianshan Mountains,
    They wound their way out of the forests,
    Their home is behind the Junggar Basin!
    They emerged from the tents.
    From childhood, they were companions with cattle and sheep,
    At nine, they drew bows to shoot eagles,
    But lived to sixteen without ever touching a book,
    Only seeing the Bai's [1] children flipping through dictionaries.
    Until the first Communist Party member,
    Moved the desk to their grassland,
    Only then did they learn to solve four arithmetic problems,
    Only then did they understand how society evolves.
    They began to taste,
    A life sweeter than grapes;
    They began to understand,
    A tomorrow more beautiful than Anjihai [2].
    They hope on their pasture,
    To establish insemination stations for cattle and sheep;
    They hope in every livestock shed,
    To hear the "baa baa" sound of the spring shears.
    Eight horseshoes kick up snow,
    Pulling the sleigh rushing forward,
    Five Kazakh girls sit on the sleigh,
    Hurrying to the agricultural college to learn new courses.

    [1] "Bai" means rich man, landlord, or herdboss.
    [2] "Anjihai" is a beautiful lake on the Junggar grassland.

    拖犁啊，向前飞奔！
    顾工
    八个马蹄踢起雪块，
    拖着爬犁向前飞奔，
    爬犁上坐着五位哈族姑娘，
    赶到农学院去学习新的课程。
    她们是从天山上面滑下来的，
    她们是从森林里面绕出来的，
    准噶尔草原后面有他们的家啊！
    她们是从帐篷里面钻出来的。
    她们从小就和牛羊结伴，
    九岁就拉开了射鹰的弓箭，
    但是活到十六岁还没有摸过书本，
    只看见巴依〔一〕的孩子翻着字典。
    直等到第一个共产党员，
    把书桌搬到她们的草原，
    才使她们学会分解四则难题，
    才使她们懂得社会怎样演变。
    她们开始尝到，
    比葡萄还甜的生活；
    她们开始懂得，
    比安极海〔二〕还美的明天。
    她们希望自己的牧场上，
    给牛羊设立授精站；
    她们希望每个畜棚里，
    响着“啊啊”声的弹簧剪。
    八个马蹄踢起雪块，
    拖着爬犁向前飞奔，
    爬犁上坐着五位哈族姑娘，
    赶到农学院去学习新的课程。
    〔一〕“巴依”即财主、地主、或牧主。
    〔二〕“安极海”是准噶尔草原上一个美丽的湖泊。
