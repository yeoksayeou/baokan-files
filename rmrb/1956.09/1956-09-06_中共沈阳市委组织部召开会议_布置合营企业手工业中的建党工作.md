    The CPC Shenyang Municipal Committee Organization Department Holds Meeting to Deploy Party Building Work in Jointly-Operated Enterprises and Handicraft Industries

    (Our Newspaper News) In late August, the CPC Shenyang Municipal Committee Organization Department convened a city-wide meeting on Party building in joint state-private industrial and commercial enterprises and handicraft production cooperatives, summarizing and deploying future Party building work. At the meeting, the person in charge of the Municipal Committee Organization Department delivered a report on "The Situation and Future Opinions on Party Building in Joint State-Private Industrial and Commercial Enterprises and Handicraft Production Cooperatives in Shenyang City," and group discussions were held.

    Since the high tide of the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce and handicraft industry, by the end of June this year, Shenyang City had admitted more than 1,000 outstanding individuals into the Party from joint state-private industrial and commercial enterprises and handicraft production cooperatives. Due to the strengthening of the Party's strength, the smooth completion of work and production tasks in various periods of joint state-private industrial and commercial enterprises and handicraft production cooperatives has been further guaranteed.

    However, the completion of Party building plans in joint ventures and handicrafts in Shenyang is uneven; in some units, there have been phenomena of rushing and lowering the requirements for Party members; there are also shortcomings in the education of new Party members, resulting in many new Party members not receiving the improvement they deserve after joining the Party. The occurrence of these phenomena is because many Party organizations have not fully recognized the importance and urgency of actively doing a good job in Party building in these departments, and have placed Party building work in opposition to the actual struggle of transforming enterprises and doing a good job in production. At the same time, many grassroots branch cadres and Party members lack knowledge of Party building business, and have not fully mobilized the entire Party to do Party building work, and the Municipal Committee Organization Department lacks timely guidance on Party building work in these departments, and the supervision and inspection are not thorough enough.

    The meeting pointed out that the task of Party building in the second half of this year is arduous. Actively and cautiously doing a good job in developing the Party in joint state-private industrial and commercial enterprises and handicraft production cooperatives, establishing grassroots Party organizations, improving organizational forms, and further strengthening the Party's leadership over joint state-private industrial and commercial enterprises and handicraft production cooperatives are important tasks of Party organizations in joint state-private industrial and commercial enterprises and handicraft production cooperatives. Therefore, Party committee organization departments must strengthen specific leadership over Party building work in these departments; formulate specific and feasible Party building plans; actively train Party building backbones to improve their professional level in Party building work; combine with various central tasks, mobilize the entire Party to do the work of cultivating and examining non-Party activists; strengthen the education of probationary Party members, so that the probationary period of probationary Party members truly becomes a strict period of testing, rather than an empty formality.

    At the meeting, the branches of the Liancheng Screw Factory, Dongyuan Dyeing and Weaving Factory, and the Fourth Sewing Production Cooperative in Nanshi, Beiguan, and Shenhe districts also introduced their experiences.

### 中共沈阳市委组织部召开会议  布置合营企业手工业中的建党工作

    中共沈阳市委组织部召开会议
    布置合营企业手工业中的建党工作
    本报讯　8月下旬，中共沈阳市委组织部召开了全市公私合营工商业和手工业生产合作社建党工作会议，总结、布置了今后的建党工作。会上，由市委组织部负责同志做了“沈阳市公私合营工商业与手工业生产社中建党工作的情况与今后意见”的报告，并分组进行了讨论。
    从资本主义工商业和手工业社会主义改造高潮到来以后，到今年6月底，沈阳市在公私合营工商业和手工业生产合作社中，共接收了一千多名优秀分子入党。由于党的力量的加强，进一步保证了合营工商业和手工业生产合作社各个时期的工作和生产任务的顺利完成。
    但是，沈阳市合营企业和手工业中的建党计划完成的情况是不平衡的；在一些单位中还发生了拉夫凑数、降低党员条件的现象；对新党员的教育工作也有缺点，致使许多新党员入党后没有得到应有的提高。这些现象的发生，是由于不少党组织没有充分认识到当前在这些部门中积极做好建党工作的重要性和迫切性，把建党工作同改造企业的实际斗争和搞好生产对立起来。同时，不少基层支部干部和党员还缺少建党业务知识，没有充分发动全党动手做建党工作，而市委组织部对这些部门的建党工作又缺乏及时的指导，督促检查不够深入。
    会议指出，今年下半年的建党工作任务是繁重的。积极慎重地在公私合营工商业和手工业生产合作社中做好发展党的工作，建立党的基层组织，改进组织形式，进一步加强党对合营工商业和手工业生产社的领导，是合营工商业和手工业生产社中党组织的重要任务。因此，党委组织部门要加强对这些部门建党工作的具体领导；订出具体可行的建党计划；积极地训练建党骨干，提高他们的建党工作业务水平；结合各项中心工作，发动全党动手，做好培养、考察非党积极分子的工作；加强对候补党员的教育，使候补党员的候补期真正成为严格的考验时期，而不是一种空洞的形式。
    会上，还由南市、北关、沈河区的公私合营联成螺钉厂、东源染织厂和第四缝纫生产合作社支部介绍了经验。
