    The Female Director Problem
    Ben Bo
    
    At a meeting, someone suddenly brought up the issue of promoting women to be directors of agricultural production cooperatives, which sparked a round of discussion:

    One comrade said first: "That, how can that work? A cooperative is such a large undertaking, how can women lead it?"

      "Yes!" another comrade chimed in with a heavy voice: "A cooperative has hundreds of families, tens of thousands of mu of land. Letting women be the director is not reassuring!"

    At this moment, a rough voice, as if having made a new discovery, whispered into people's ears: "Look! Women wanting to be directors is all the doing of the Women's Federation. The Women's Federation fabricated a report and sent it to the Provincial Party Committee, which approved it and forwarded it to all counties. As a result, our county's Women's Federation has something to rely on. They use this to question us: why don't we promote women to be full directors? Think about it, how can that be the Provincial Party Committee's idea?"

    Of course, there were also people at the meeting who suggested cultivating women. One comrade said sincerely and seriously: "It's still possible for us to find one or two women in a county to be cooperative directors! In the past, some female cooperative cadres were very capable, but everyone looked down on them. You'd stab her with a word, he'd stab her with a word, and she'd be knocked down. In one cooperative in our county, the higher-ups appointed a woman as deputy director. The comrades of the cooperative management committee told her: let's divide the work like this! We'll take care of production matters, and you go take care of the nursery. Sure enough, this female cooperative director went to the nursery every day to take care of the children, effectively becoming a nanny. But since she was the deputy director, she had to be called to cooperative meetings. When this female director came to the meeting, the children would be left unattended, and if she took care of the children, she couldn't come to the meeting. The parents of the nursery said she didn't manage well, and the cooperative also said she wasn't doing her job. This way, with all the back and forth, a female cadre was ruined."

    This comrade's opinion did indeed gain the sympathy of many people, but he didn't please everyone. A comrade sitting against the wall pursed his lips and said indignantly: "Cultivate them! They'll run away once they're almost ready. We cultivated a female cooperative cadre in our area and sent her to senior primary school, but after graduating from senior primary school, she didn't return to the cooperative. No matter what, she wouldn't do it and went to take the middle school entrance exam!"

    However, no matter how they discussed it, since the Women's Federation had the Provincial Party Committee's backing, it was hard to disobey. So everyone came to this conclusion: appoint more deputy directors. Even if they want to be full directors, we can set up more full directors, such as First Director and Second Director, and let women be the Second Director.

    I felt deeply subtle upon hearing this conclusion. Without specifically analyzing specific people, just frowning upon hearing about women being cooperative directors, what is the reason for this? For some female cadres whose cooperative management abilities are not yet strong enough, it is not unreasonable to let them serve in more deputy positions; but I fear that this kind of promotion out of helplessness will lead to this situation: nominally a cooperative director, but actually a nanny.

    女主任问题
    笨伯
    在一个会议上，忽然有人提出要提拔妇女当农业生产合作社的主任问题，由此引起了一番议论：
    一个同志首先说：“那，那怎么行呢？合作社那样大一个摊子，妇女怎么能领导呢？”
      “是呀！”一个同志接上拖着沉重的声音说：“合作社几百家人，上万亩地，让妇女去当主任是不放心的！”
    这时，一个粗嗓子，好像有什么新发现似的，挨到人们的耳根说：“那里哟！妇女要当主任，都是妇联会搞的，妇联会在那里胡弄了一个报告送给省委，省委一批，转发给各县，于是我们县里的妇联会就有把凭了。她们拿着这个把凭来质问我们：为什么不提拔妇女当正主任，你想，这那里是省委的意见哩？”
    当然，会上也还有人提出要培养妇女的问题，有一个同志诚挚而严肃地说：“我们一个县要找一两个妇女当社主任还是可以的！过去有些女社干部本来很能干，但是大家对她瞧不起，你刺她一句，他刺她一句，就把她打下去了。我们县里有一个社，上级指定了一个妇女当副主任，社管理委员会的同志和她说：我们这样分工吧！我们管生产上的事，你去管托儿所。果然这个女社主任每天就到托儿所去管孩子，实际上是当了一名媬姆，但是既然她是副主任，社里开会总还要叫她，这个女主任来开会，孩子就无人管，管了孩子就不能来开会。托儿所的家长说她管得不好，社里也说她不尽职，这样东折西磨，就把一个女干部毁了。”
    这位同志的意见的确也得到很多人的同情，但是他没有得到每个人的欢喜。靠墙坐着的一位同志噘着嘴，愤愤地说：“培养吧！培养到差不离就跑了。我们那里培养了一个女社干部，让她上高小，但是高小一毕业就不回社，怎么也不干，就考中学去了！”
    但是，不管怎样议论，究竟妇联会拿着省委的把柄，不好违拗，于是大家得出这样的结论：多安副主任，即使要当正主任，可以多设正主任，如第一主任、第二主任，让妇女当第二主任。
    我听了这个结论深感微妙。不具体分析具体的人，只要听到妇女当社主任，就皱眉头，这到底是什么道理？对于一些办社能力还不够强的女干部，让她们多任副职，原是无可非议的；但这种出于无可奈何的提拔，我怕又会出现这样的情况：名义上是社主任，实际上是媬姆。
