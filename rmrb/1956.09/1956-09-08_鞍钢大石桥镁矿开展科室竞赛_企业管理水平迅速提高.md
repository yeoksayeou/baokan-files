Xinhua News Agency reporter Xu Fang reports: After Anshan Iron and Steel's Dashiqiao Magnesium Mine launched a department competition, it changed the situation where administrative management work lagged behind the advanced producer movement and rapidly improved the level of enterprise management.

This spring, an advanced producer movement flourished in the magnesium mine workshops of Dashiqiao. One advanced experience after another emerged, and the workshops continuously raised a series of new issues requiring departments to solve the supply of raw materials and tools, improve process regulations, and improve labor organization. However, the work of the departments did not keep up in time, and advanced experiences were difficult to promote.

A person in charge of the magnesium mine recalled the situation at the time to the reporter, saying: In April, the advanced experience of the "crushed stone chute furnace" was to be fully promoted. If all sintering furnaces adopted this new operating method, nearly 10,000 tons of magnesium products could be produced annually, worth 780,000 yuan. However, due to the failure to supply a large amount of crushed stone, this experience could not be promoted. The production technology department was questioned by workers every day: Why not find a way to solve the problem of crushed stone? The mining workshop wanted to promote the advanced experience of "large deep-hole drilling," and the drill bit had to be enlarged and the drill rod lengthened. The workshop asked the supply department for new tools. However, the supply department had to act in accordance with the company's regulations. The supply plan must submit a budget in the previous month before the required tools can be received in the second month. In this way, the experience of "large deep-hole drilling" had to be delayed for two months before it could be promoted.

Under this circumstance, the leadership of Dashiqiao Magnesium Mine launched a socialist competition in all twenty-two departments of the mine, with the main content being to help workshops solve key problems in promoting advanced experiences. Department staff went deep into the workshops. The production technology department sent people to work with the sintering workshop technicians to research and successfully develop a type of screening funnel, which greatly increased the output of crushed stone, thereby solving the problem of crushed stone supply. The supply department also sent people out to order large hard alloy drill bits, and sent the collected old drill bits and short drill rods to the factory for processing and repair.

Within a week, the tools needed to promote "large deep-hole drilling" were all available. Subsequently, the mining workshop proposed merging the two types of work, mining and transportation, so that mining workers could learn transportation and transportation workers could learn mining, and labor productivity could be increased by 5%. However, to merge these two types of work, it was necessary to re-formulate process regulations, change labor organization, and adjust wages. The formulation of this process regulation originally required dozens of days, but in the department competition, the process regulation for merging mining and transportation was formulated within a week. Cost and financial statements used to take until the 12th of the following month to be completed, but now they are calculated on the 3rd of the following month. Accountant You Xiangge used to be able to calculate the wages of only 900 people per month, but now he can calculate the wages of 1,700 people.

After the department competition was launched, the relationship between departments, and between departments and workshops, became closer. For example, in the past, accounting staff rarely went to the workshops; when they did, it was to urge the reporting of statements. After the competition began, accountants went deep into the workshops and helped the workshop economic accounting staff simplify the five types of statements into three types, which accelerated the speed of economic accounting.

Dashiqiao Magnesium Mine has fully completed the national plan for eight consecutive months this year, and has become one of the best units in the advanced producer movement of Anshan Iron and Steel. Starting in September, the Anshan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party organized leaders of various factories of Anshan Iron and Steel to go to Dashiqiao Magnesium Mine in batches to learn from the experience of leading the advanced producer movement.

### 鞍钢大石桥镁矿开展科室竞赛  企业管理水平迅速提高

    鞍钢大石桥镁矿开展科室竞赛
    企业管理水平迅速提高
    据新华社记者徐放报道：鞍钢大石桥镁矿开展科室竞赛后，改变了行政管理工作落后于先进生产者运动的情况，迅速提高了企业管理的水平。
    今年春天，大石桥的镁矿车间里蓬勃地开展起先进生产者运动，先进经验一件又一件地涌现出来，车间里不断提出要求科室解决原料、工具的供应和改进工艺规程、劳动组织等一连串的新问题。但是，科室工作没有及时赶上去，先进经验很难推广。
    镁矿的一位负责人向记者追述当时的情景说：4月份要全面推广“碎石溜炉”的先进经验。如果所有的烧结炉都采用这个新的操作方法，每年可以增产将近一万吨镁产品，价值七十八万元。可是由于大批碎石供应不上，这项经验就无法推广。生产技术科天天受到工人的责问：为什么不设法解决碎石问题？采矿车间要推广“大孔深眼”先进经验，必须把钎头改大，钎子杆改长。车间向供应科要新工具。供应科却要按公司的规定办事。供应计划一定要在前一个月提出预算，第二个月才能领到所要的工具。这样，“大孔深眼”的经验，就得拖延两个月才能推广。
    在这种情况下，大石桥镁矿领导方面，就在全矿二十二个科室中开展了以帮助车间解决推广先进经验中的关键问题为主要内容的社会主义竞赛。科室工作人员深入车间了。生产技术科派人和烧结车间技术员研究成功了一种分筛漏斗，使碎石的产量大量增加，从而解决了碎石的供应问题。供应科还派人出去订购大型的硬质合金钎头，并且将搜集的旧钎头和短钎子送到工厂去加工修理。
    在一个星期以内，推广“大孔深眼”所要的工具齐备了。接着，采矿车间提出要把采矿和搬运两个工种合并，采矿工人学会搬运，搬运工人学会采矿，劳动生产率就能提高5％。可是这两种工种要合并，就必须重新制订工艺规程，改变劳动组织，调整工资等。这项工艺规程的制订本来需要好几十天，但是在科室竞赛中，一个星期之内就把采运合并的工艺规程订了出来。成本和财务报表过去要在下月12日才能做好，现在下月3日就算出来了。会计员游翔阁过去每月只能算九百个人的工资，现在能计算一千七百人的工资了。
    科室竞赛开展以后，科室和科室、科室和车间之间的关系密切了。如过去会计人员无事不下车间；下车间就是催报表。竞赛开始以后，会计员深入车间，帮助车间经济核算员把五种报表简化为三种报表，经济核算的速度就加快了。
    大石桥镁矿今年连续八个月都全面完成了国家计划，并且已经成为鞍钢先进生产者运动中最好的一个单位。9月份开始，中共鞍山市委组织鞍钢各厂领导人员，分批到大石桥镁矿学习领导先进生产者运动的经验。
