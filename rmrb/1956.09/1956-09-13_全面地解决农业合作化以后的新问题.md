    For the past six months, the vast rural areas of our country have been engaged in production under conditions where agricultural cooperativization has been basically realized. With the fundamental change in production relations, many new situations and new problems have emerged. In the past six months, in response to some of the new problems that have arisen in the new rural situation, the CPC Central Committee and the State Council have jointly or separately issued important instructions on running cooperatives diligently and frugally, on summer harvest distribution, etc., promptly proposing specific methods for solving the new problems that arose at the time and the direction for improving work, which has played a significant role in the healthy growth of agricultural cooperatives and the activation of rural economic life.
    At present, the tremendous changes caused by agricultural cooperativization have involved all aspects of social, political, and economic life. Therefore, more complete regulations are urgently needed regarding the work of agricultural production cooperatives, the relationship between agricultural cooperatives and other economic organizations, and so on. After more than half a year of practice, we have gained many valuable experiences and lessons on how to lead the economic and organizational work after the basic realization of agricultural cooperativization throughout the country, and these should be summarized in a timely manner. Now, the "Instructions on Strengthening Production Leadership and Organizational Construction of Agricultural Production Cooperatives" issued by the CPC Central Committee and the State Council are the result of investigating and studying new situations and summarizing new experiences. It proposes the correct guidelines and specific methods for solving the new problems and new contradictions currently emerging in rural areas.
    It correctly resolves the relationship between increasing grain and cotton production and diversified operations. After cooperativization, there are better conditions for implementing the division of labor and developing diversified economies. As long as rural work leaders follow the methods proposed in the instructions and overcome the current tendency of production specialization, agricultural cooperatives will not only be able to continue to increase grain and cotton production, but will also be able to comprehensively develop agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and other sideline occupations.
    It points out the correct way to resolve the contradiction between the subjective requirements of production planning and production reform and objective reality: when formulating plans, a combination of top-down and bottom-up methods should be adopted, and central and local authorities should manage them at different levels. The central government should gradually transition to only stipulating agricultural product procurement and allocation plans. For various technological reforms, they should be tested locally to ensure effectiveness, and then gradually promoted in several steps. This can correct and prevent problems that are divorced from reality.
    It also stipulates the guidelines for resolving the relationship between the collective and the individual. In cooperatives, the contradiction between the collective and the individual is originally not antagonistic; however, the demands of some cooperative leaders or members are often one-sided, which must be adjusted to take care of all aspects. Attention should be paid both to the necessary accumulation in the cooperative and to increasing the distribution to members; both to developing the collective production of the cooperative and to organizing the sideline occupations of members' families; and members should also be left with appropriate private plots, and the depreciation of livestock and farm implements should be reasonable. Under current conditions, sideline occupations that are conducive to decentralized management should be managed by member families as much as possible. When dealing with various specific issues related to the relationship between the cooperative and its members, the mass line should be fully followed, and implemented only after obtaining the consent of the members.
    It also stipulates that the organizational form of cooperatives should be adapted to natural conditions, technical conditions, management levels, and production content. Generally speaking, under the same technical conditions, large-scale production is always superior to small-scale production. However, if one blindly pursues large scale, regardless of needs and possibilities, and becomes too large to suit the specific conditions, it will be detrimental to production. Because when the cooperative becomes too large, the production team also becomes too large or has too many levels. It is also difficult to maintain internal unity in a large cooperative that includes several villages with disparate economic and work foundations. Existing large cooperatives that can be run well should strive to be run well; if they really cannot be run well and the masses firmly demand separation, they can be appropriately separated.
    The instruction also proposes to focus on resolving the relationship between agricultural cooperatives and other economic organizations, especially the relationship with commercial and supply and marketing agencies. Agricultural cooperativization originally provided favorable conditions for the combination of agriculture and commerce; however, these favorable conditions have been abused in some places. Some abnormal phenomena should now be overcome. For example, in the purchase of agricultural and sideline products, the quantity of assigned purchases should not exceed the actual production situation, and the price should not be too low; in terms of supply, the phenomena of forced sales and excessive price differences should be corrected; agricultural product processing should not be excessively concentrated in cities, so that rural areas also have a considerable part of the processing industry to appropriately meet farmers' needs for feed and fertilizer. The instruction proposes to "gradually establish a free market under the leadership of the socialist economy," which is essential for activating rural economic life and beneficial to the entire socialist construction. The economic relationship between agricultural cooperatives and handicraft cooperatives is very close, and there are many problems between them. We must solve their division of labor and collaboration problems so that abnormal phenomena such as competing for markets, competing for raw materials, and competing for members no longer occur.
    The relationship between party organizations, government organs, and agricultural cooperatives should be kept normal. Currently, there are many places where chaotic phenomena have occurred in these relationships, which must be prevented in a timely manner. The activities of rural grassroots party organizations should be more active after cooperativization; cooperative cadres should not replace many administrative tasks of the township people's committees, and resident cadres should not take over many tasks of the cadres within the cooperative. The principle of combining collective leadership and individual responsibility should be used to correctly handle the relationship between the party, government, and cooperative, in order to strengthen the party's leadership and further bring into play the enthusiasm of grassroots organizations.
    The "Instructions on Strengthening Production Leadership and Organizational Construction of Agricultural Production Cooperatives" issued by the CPC Central Committee and the State Council are an important guideline for building a new socialist countryside after the basic realization of agricultural cooperativization in our country. Every method of solving problems proposed in the instructions is for consolidating victory and continuing to advance. As the instruction says: "Solving these problems will surely mobilize all positive factors, further consolidate the cooperatives, and further promote the high tide of agricultural production."

### 全面地解决农业合作化以后的新问题

    全面地解决农业合作化以后的新问题
    我国的广大农村在基本上实现了农业合作化的情况下进行生产，已经大半年了。随着生产关系的根本变化，出现了许多新情况和新问题。半年来，针对着农村新形势下发生的一些新问题，中共中央和国务院已经陆续地联合发布或分别发布了关于勤俭办社、关于夏收分配等重要的指示，及时地提出了解决当时发生的新问题的具体办法和改进工作的方向，对于农业社的健康成长和农村经济生活的活跃起了很大作用。
    目前，农业合作化引起的巨大变化，已经牵涉到了社会政治经济生活的各个方面。因此，对于有关农业生产合作社的工作、农业社和别的经济组织的关系等等，迫切需要作出更完整的规定。经过大半年的实践，对于如何领导全国基本上实现农业合作化以后的经济工作和组织工作，已经有了不少宝贵的经验和教训，也应该及时地加以总结。现在，中共中央和国务院发布的“关于加强农业生产合作社的生产领导和组织建设的指示”，就是调查研究了新情况和总结了新经验的结果。它提出了解决目前农村中出现的新问题和新矛盾的正确方针和具体办法。
    它正确地解决了增产粮棉和多种经营之间的关系问题。合作化以后有更好的条件实行分工分业，发展多种经济。只要农村工作领导人员按照指示中提出的办法，克服目前生产单一化的偏向，农业社就不但能够继续增产粮食和棉花，并且一定能够使农、林、牧及其他副业得到全面的发展。
    它指出了解决生产计划、生产改革的主观要求和客观实际的矛盾的正确途径：在制定计划时要采取从上而下和从下而上相结合的方法，并且由中央和地方分级管理，中央要逐步过渡到只规定农产品采购计划和调拨计划。对于各项技术改革，要经过本地试验确有成效，然后分几个步骤逐渐推广。这样就可以纠正和防止脱离实际的毛病。
    它还规定了解决集体和个人之间的关系问题的方针。在合作社里，集体和个人的矛盾本来不是对抗性的；但是，有些合作社领导上的要求或社员的要求往往有片面性，这就必须加以调整，照顾全面。既要注意社里有必要的积累，又要注意增加给社员的分配；既要发展社里的集体生产，又要组织社员的家庭副业；还应该留给社员以适当的自用地，对牲畜农具的折价也要合理。在目前条件下，利于分散经营的副业应当尽可能多让社员家庭经营。在处理合作社和社员关系的各种具体问题的时候，都应该充分走群众路线，取得社员的同意然后实行。
    它还规定了要使合作社的组织形式同自然条件、技术条件、管理水平以及生产内容相适应。一般地说，在相同的技术条件下，大规模的生产总比小规模的生产有更大的优越性。可是，如果一味贪大，不顾需要和可能，大到不适合具体条件，就反而不利于生产。因为社大了，生产队也就过大或者层次过多。一个包括经济基础和工作基础悬殊的若干村子的大社，内部团结也很难搞好。现有的大社能办好的要努力办好；实在办不好的，群众坚决要求分开，就可以适当分开。
    这个指示还提出了要着重解决农业社和别的经济组织之间的关系，特别是同商业和供销机构之间的关系问题。农业合作化本来为农业和商业的结合提供了有利的条件；但是，这种有利条件在某些地方被滥用了。现在应该克服一些不正常的现象。比如，在收购农副产品方面，派购数量不可超过实际生产状况，价格不可偏低；在供应方面，强迫推销和差价过大的现象应该纠正；农产品加工不宜过分集中于城市，以便农村中也有相当部分的加工业，适当满足农民对饲料和肥料的要求。指示中提出要“逐步建立在社会主义经济领导下的自由市场”，这对于活跃农村经济生活是十分必要的，对于整个社会主义建设也是有利的。农业合作社同手工业合作社的经济关系很密切，它们之间发生的问题也很多，必须解决它们的分工协作问题，使互争市场、互争原料、互争社员等不正常的现象不再发生。
    党组织、政权机关和农业社之间的关系应当保持正常。目前有不少地方，在这些关系方面发生了混乱现象，必须及时防止。农村基层党组织的活动在合作化以后应该更加活跃；合作社干部不要去代替乡人民委员会的许多行政工作，驻社干部也不要包办社内干部的许多工作。要以集体领导和个人负责相结合的原则，正确地处理党、政、社的关系，以达到加强党的领导、进一步发挥基层组织积极性的目的。
    中共中央和国务院“关于加强农业生产合作社的生产领导和组织建设的指示”，是我国农业合作化基本实现以后建设社会主义新农村的重要指针。指示中提出的解决问题的每一项办法，都是为了巩固胜利，继续前进。正如指示中所说的：“这些问题解决了，就一定会调动一切积极因素，进一步巩固合作社，进一步促进农业生产的高涨。”
