    Introduction to Shenyang Cable Factory
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter Gu Tie Feng

    From submarine cables as thick as bowls to special wires finer than hair, these will be manufactured at the Shenyang Cable Factory, which is already in production. This factory, renovated with Soviet assistance, is a modern comprehensive factory for manufacturing cables and wires. The start of production at this factory, equipped with advanced technology, marks a new stage in China's cable manufacturing.

    Old China was very backward in cable manufacturing, only able to make ordinary wires such as rubber wires, yarn-wrapped wires, and bare copper wires, and even then on a very small scale. After liberation, although China began to manufacture a small amount of power cables and telephone cables, it still lagged far behind the needs of large-scale economic construction.

    After the Shenyang Cable Factory goes into production, it will produce dozens of models and more than 10,000 specifications of cables and wires, many of which China has never been able to manufacture before. In the past, China could only manufacture 10,000-volt high-voltage power cables. Now, this factory can manufacture 35,000-volt high-voltage power cables and will trial-produce 110,000-volt and 220,000-volt ultra-high-voltage cables. It can also manufacture copper-core aluminum stranded wires for ultra-high-voltage overhead lines, oil exploration cables, and long-distance telephone cables. Lacquer wire used in automobiles, which is cold-resistant, heat-resistant, and oil-proof, will also be manufactured in this factory. Steel-core aluminum stranded wires produced during the trial production stage of this factory have already been used in reservoirs such as Guanting, Foziling, Meishan, and Dahuoquan. Industrial construction units in Baotou, Wuhan, Lanzhou, Urumqi, Anshan, Changchun, and Shenyang, such as iron and steel, petroleum, machinery, and electrical appliances, have also successively received supplies from this factory.

    It is not easy to make various cables and wires from copper blocks and aluminum ingots. The Shenyang Cable Factory uses precision machines for production. After smelting and casting, the heated copper ingots are rolled into small finger-thick copper bars in a complete set of rolling mills. These copper bars are automatically sent to the bare wire workshop for further processing. The copper bars are drawn into copper wires of different thicknesses through continuous drawing machines of different sizes. In the bare wire workshop, some copper wires and aluminum wires are made into copper electric wires, aluminum electric wires, and copper-core aluminum stranded wires for power transmission; the other copper wires and aluminum wires are sent to three workshops: rubber-insulated cables, paper-insulated cables, and enameled wires, where insulating materials are coated by machines to make various power cables, telephone cables, and enameled wires. There are also various insulating materials, including rubber, paper, yarn, paint, glass silk, and asbestos. Taking submarine telephone cables as an example, paper is used as the insulating material. Sixty copper wires pass through a paper pulp machine, automatically coated with paper pulp, then wrapped with cable paper, and many wires are twisted together to form a thick cable. This thick cable is wrapped with lead sheathing by a lead press, and the lead sheathing is wrapped with nine layers of paper, three layers of asphalt, and one layer of hemp rope, and finally wrapped with a layer of copper wire. In this way, the thick and heavy telephone cable can provide up to 2,400 telephones for simultaneous calls. When it is submerged on the seabed, it is impermeable and unbreakable.

    The Shenyang Cable Factory has a complete central laboratory with highly precise physical, chemical, electrical, metal, and complete sets of process testing equipment. This is a specialized testing and research institution that will research and test various raw materials and new products of cables and wires, so that China's technical level in manufacturing cables and wires will continue to improve.

    Outside the connected factory buildings of the Shenyang Cable Factory, flowers are in full bloom and green trees are lined up. Inside the tall factory buildings, it is clean and bright, with a suitable temperature. In such an environment, the labor of the workers will become a pleasant activity.

    The steel beam erection project on the Wuchang bank of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge will start about twenty days ahead of the original schedule. The approach bridge project has now been basically completed. The picture shows masons making bridge powder lines on the approach bridge to prepare for the beam erection project.

    沈阳电缆厂介绍
    新华社记者　顾铁凤
    从像碗口一般粗的海底电缆到比头发还细的特种电线将在已经投入生产的沈阳电缆厂制造出来。这个由苏联帮助改建成的工厂，是一座现代化的制造电缆和电线的综合工厂。这座用先进技术装备起来的工厂开始生产，标志着中国在制造电缆方面走上了新的阶段。
    旧中国在电缆制造方面是非常落后的，只能做些像皮线、纱包线和裸铜线等普通电线，而且规模极小。解放以后，中国虽然开始制造少量的电力电缆和电话电缆，但是仍然远远落后于大规模经济建设的需要。
    沈阳电缆厂投入生产以后，它将生产几十种型号、一万多种规格的电缆和电线，其中许多是国内从来不能制造的。过去中国只能制造一万伏的高压电力电缆，现在这个厂能够制造三万五千伏的高压电力电缆，并且将试制十一万伏、二十二万伏的超高压电缆。它还可以制造超高压架空线路用的铜芯铝绞线、石油勘探电缆和长途电话电缆等。制造汽车所用的能耐寒、耐高热、防油的腊克线，也将在这个工厂制造出来。官厅、佛子岭、梅山、大伙房等水库，现在已经用上了这个工厂试生产阶段生产的钢芯铝绞线。在包头、武汉、兰州、乌鲁木齐、鞍山、长春和沈阳等地的钢铁、石油、机械、电器等工业建设单位，也都相继得到这个厂产品的供应。
    从铜块、铝锭制成各种各样的电缆、电线是很不容易的，沈阳电缆厂是利用精密的机器进行生产的。经过熔炼、铸锭以后又加热的铜锭，在成套的压延机里轧成小手指粗的铜条。这些铜条被自动送到裸线车间，再进行加工。铜条通过大小不同的连续式拉线机，被拉成一根根粗细不一的铜线。在裸线车间里，一部分铜线、铝线制成输电用的铜电线、铝电线和铜芯铝绞线；另一部分铜线，铝线分别送到橡皮绝缘电缆、纸绝缘电缆和电磁线等三个车间，用机器包涂绝缘物，制成各种电力电缆，电话电缆和电磁线。绝缘物也是多种多样的，有橡皮、纸、纱、漆、玻璃丝和石棉。以海底电话电缆来说，是用纸做绝缘物的。六十根铜线穿过纸浆机，自动涂上了纸浆，再包上电缆纸，把许多根线绞在一起制成了一根很粗的电缆。这根很粗的电缆用压铅机包上铅皮，铅皮外面再包上九层纸、三层沥青和一层麻绳，最后绕上一层铜丝。这样，又粗又沉的电话电缆最多就可以供给两千四百架电话机同时通话，沉在海底里，浸不透，也冲不断。
    沈阳电缆厂有一座完善的中央试验室，它有高度精密的物理、化学、电气、金属和整套的工艺试验设备。这是一所专门的试验、研究机构，它将研究、试验各种原材料和电缆、电线的新产品，使中国制造电缆、电线的技术水平不断提高。
    在沈阳电缆厂一片毗连着的厂房外面，鲜花盛开，绿树成行。高大的厂房内，清洁明亮，温度适宜。在这样的环境里，工人们的劳动将成为一种愉快的活动。
    武汉长江大桥武昌岸的钢梁架设工程，将比原计划提前二十天左右动工。现在引桥工程已基本完工。图为泥工们在引桥上做桥粉线，为架梁工程作好准备。　李季春摄（湖北日报社稿）
