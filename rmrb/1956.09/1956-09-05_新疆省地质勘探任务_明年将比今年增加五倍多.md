    Xinjiang Province's Geological Exploration Tasks
    To Increase More Than Fivefold Next Year
    According to the Xinjiang Daily, the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Geological Bureau is stepping up preparations to meet next year's tasks. According to the preliminary estimates of the Planning Department of the Geological Bureau, next year's geological exploration tasks will increase more than fivefold compared to this year, equivalent to the sum of all tasks completed by the Geological Bureau in the past. In accordance with the needs of the increased tasks, the total number of employees in the Bureau will need to increase more than fourfold next year. The Geological Bureau has recently promoted a group of engineers from among the technical personnel, and also promoted a group of section chiefs and division chiefs. The existing drilling worker training class will also be expanded into a drilling technician school, and this year each drilling rig in each exploration team is training cadres for next year's work. They proposed that one drilling rig should train a full set of personnel needed for three drilling rigs next year. In terms of material equipment, a large number of winter protection equipment, laboratory reagents, auto parts, hardware tools, etc. need to be prepared, and these issues need the assistance of relevant departments of the Autonomous Region to resolve.

    新疆省地质勘探任务
    明年将比今年增加五倍多
    据新疆日报讯　新疆维吾尔自治区地质局正在加紧准备迎接明年的任务。据地质局计划处初步估计，明年的地质勘探任务将比今年增加五倍多，相当于历年来地质局所完成任务的总和。按照任务增加的需要，明年全局的职工需增加四倍以上。地质局最近已经在技术人员中提拔了一批工程师，并且提拔了一批科长、处长级干部。现有的钻探工人训练班也将扩大为钻探技工学校，今年各勘探队每一台钻机都在为明年的工作培养干部。他们提出，一台钻机要为明年培养三台钻机所需的全套人员。在物质设备方面，需要准备大批冬防设备，化验药品、汽车零件、五金工具等，这些问题都需要自治区有关部门协助解决。
