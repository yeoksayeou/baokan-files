Discussion on the Issue of Subsidies for Agricultural Cooperative Cadres
Zhang Ziyi

In his article "How to Calculate Subsidies for Agricultural Cooperative Cadres Rationally" (see page 3 of the People's Daily, August 15th), Comrade Jin Mingqiao listed the subsidy calculation methods of two agricultural cooperatives and proposed a calculation method of "the number of subsidy workdays for a staff member is equal to the average annual workdays made by each person of that labor grade, multiplied by the percentage of necessary missed work of the individual" (hereinafter referred to as the percentage calculation method). The calculation method adopted by the Deli Temple Collective Farm in Fuxian County is indeed unscientific and unfair; I agree with Comrade Jin on this point. As for whether the method of "fixed subsidy, fixed work production, and year-end bonus combined" (hereinafter referred to as the fixed subsidy method) adopted by the Xijing'an Agricultural Cooperative in Xingtai County is truly unreasonable, and whether the percentage calculation method proposed by Comrade Jin is reasonable, it is worth further study.

Comrade Jin Mingqiao believes that the fixed subsidy method causes the labor remuneration of the top-grade labor force and the director of the cooperative to always be inversely proportional, which may lead the management personnel of the cooperative to try to reduce the number of workdays that should be earned for completing each work quota, so that the number of workdays made by everyone is reduced, thereby increasing the remuneration of the management personnel. This is inconsistent with the current actual situation.

At present, many agricultural cooperatives have implemented the "contract work and output" system. In agricultural cooperatives that have implemented the "contract work and output" system, the number of workdays required per mu for various crops is calculated based on the stipulated work quotas and remuneration standards, and then the number of workdays for all crops in each production team is calculated, plus a certain number of odd jobs and mobile work, which is used as the contract work number for each production team. It is also stipulated that the contract work number remains fixed, except when encountering major changes in natural conditions that may increase or decrease the production team's contract work number. Since the contract work number is fixed, the total actual workdays of the entire cooperative throughout the year will generally not be more or less than the expected workdays. Therefore, the bias in the fixed subsidy calculation method pointed out by Comrade Jin does not exist in these cooperatives.

Among the agricultural cooperatives that have not implemented the "contract work and output" system, many cooperatives have also stipulated work quotas and graded remuneration standards. The estimated and actual calculation of the number of workdays that should be earned for completing each work quota are based on the same standard. The management personnel of the agricultural cooperative have no need and no possibility to reduce the number of workdays that should be earned for completing each work quota.

In addition, there are many agricultural cooperatives that have neither implemented the "contract work and output" system nor stipulated work quotas. The total actual workdays of these cooperatives throughout the year may be more or less than the expected workdays, and the management personnel within the cooperative may reduce the number of workdays that should be earned for completing each work quota. Therefore, only in these cooperatives is the percentage calculation method more reasonable. It is not in line with the actual situation to negate the fixed subsidy method without analyzing the situation.

Secondly, we should further study whether the fixed subsidy method or the percentage method is better in agricultural cooperatives that have implemented the "contract work and output" system, or those that have not implemented the "contract work and output" system but have stipulated work quotas.

The so-called fixed subsidy method and percentage subsidy method are essentially within the scope of the "fixed subsidy, fixed work production" method. However, the former stipulates the "fixed subsidy" of how many workdays with an absolute number (fixed number); the latter stipulates the "fixed subsidy" of what percentage of workdays with a relative number (percentage). To be more specific: the fixed subsidy method is calculated based on the estimated number, and future increases or decreases in the actual number will no longer be adjusted accordingly; the percentage method is calculated based on the actual number, and the percentage only plays a trial calculation role when estimating remuneration, and the number of subsidy workdays is not calculated based on the estimated number.

It can be seen from this that the question of whether the fixed subsidy method is better or the percentage method is better is essentially the question of whether it is better to calculate the fixed subsidy based on the estimated number or the actual number. Now let's analyze this issue:

1. In agricultural cooperatives that have implemented the "contract work and output" system, although generally speaking, the total actual workdays of the entire cooperative throughout the year and the estimated workdays will not have a difference; however, differences may occur between labor grades. Suppose: the top-grade labor force misses more work (due to personal matters or illness), the middle-grade and lower-grade labor forces will inevitably have to do more work. Then, the average actual workdays of the top-grade labor force throughout the year will inevitably be less than the estimated number, while the middle-grade and lower-grade labor forces will be more than the estimated number. If the fixed subsidy is calculated based on the actual number, the following two unreasonable situations will arise: 1. For the top-grade labor force who misses more work, it is reasonable to earn fewer workdays for doing less work; but for the staff (such as the director of the cooperative) who calculate the subsidy by comparing with the average actual workdays of the top-grade labor force throughout the year, he does not do less work just because the top-grade labor force does less work; the actual situation may be the opposite, he actively and responsibly does more work, but he is forced to "lower his boat as the water recedes," wouldn't that be unfair! 2. For the middle-grade and lower-grade labor forces who do more work, the phenomenon of labor shortage in the cooperative occurs due to the excessive missed work of the top-grade labor force, and they must do extra work to compensate; it is reasonable for the laborers to get the extra workdays earned from this extra work. However, for the staff who calculate the subsidy by comparing with the average actual workdays of the middle-grade labor force, he does not necessarily do extra work just because the middle-grade and lower-grade labor forces do extra work; if he also rises "as the tide rises," it is obviously unreasonable.

2. When encountering major changes in natural conditions, agricultural cooperatives generally need to mobilize all forces; cadres should take the lead, how can they stand by and watch! This means that the cadres also do more work, and the cadres exceed the production quota, and they get more for more work. If calculated based on the actual number, the following phenomenon will occur: on the one hand, the cadres do more work and get an extra share; on the other hand, the number of workdays made by the members increases, and the subsidy part increases accordingly. Is this double income situation reasonable?

It can be seen that in agricultural cooperatives that have implemented the "contract work and output" system, or those that have not implemented the "contract work and output" system but have stipulated work quotas, the subsidies for cadres cannot be compared with the average actual number, but should be compared with the estimated number. Affirming that it is reasonable to compare with the estimated number, then using an absolute number to fix the number of subsidized workdays is not only more reasonable, but also clearer, and it is more convenient to calculate. On the contrary, the method of calculating the percentage by comparing with the actual number has many unreasonable aspects.

### 对农业社干部补贴问题的商讨

    对农业社干部补贴问题的商讨
    张子伊
    金明桥同志在“农业社干部的补贴怎样计算才合理”一文（见人民日报8月15日第三版）中，列举了两个农业社的干部补贴计算办法，并提出了“某一工作人员的补贴劳动日数，等于该等劳力每人平均全年所作的劳动日数，乘本人必要的误工百分数”的计算办法（以下简称百分数计算办法）。复县得利寺集体农庄所采用的计算办法，的确是欠科学、欠公平合理的；在这一点上，我同意金同志的意见。至于邢台县西静庵农业社所采用的“定额补贴，定工生产，和年终奖励相结合”的办法（以下简称固定补贴办法）是否真正不合理，金同志提出的按百分数计算的办法是不是就算合理，还值得研究。
    金明桥同志认为固定补贴的办法使上等劳动力与社主任的劳动报酬，总是成反比例，因而可能引起社的管理人员尽量压低完成每个工作定额应得的劳动日数，使大家所作的劳动日数都减少，从而提高管理人员的报酬。这是同当前实际情况不符合的。
    目前，许多农业社已经实行“包工包产”制。在已经实行“包工包产”制的农业社里，是根据规定好的工作定额和报酬标准，计算出各种作物每亩的需工数，然后计算出各生产队全部作物的用工数，再附加一定数量的零杂工和机动工，即做为各生产队的包工数。并且规定除遇到较大的自然条件的变化可以增加或减少生产队的包工数以外，包工数固定不变。既然包工数固定不变，那么，全社全年总共实际所作的劳动日数一般说来并不会多于也不会少于预计的劳动日数。因此，金同志所指出的关于固定补贴的计算办法的偏向，在这些社内是不存在的。
    未实行“包工包产”制的农业社中间，也有很多社已经规定了工作定额和分级的报酬标准。按定额和报酬标准预计和实际计算完成每个工作定额应得的劳动日数，都是根据同一个标准。农业社的管理人员，没有必要也没有可能去压低完成每个工作定额应得的劳动日数。
    此外，还有不少既未实行“包工包产”制，又未规定工作定额的农业社，这些社全年总共实际所作的劳动日可能会多于或少于预计的劳动日数，并且社内管理人员有可能去压低完成每个工作定额应得的劳动日数，因此，只有在这些社内，采用百分数的计算办法是比较合理的。如果不分析情况，一概否定了固定补贴的办法，是不符实际情况的。
    其次，我们还应该进一步研究，在已实行“包工包产”制或虽未实行“包工包产”制，但已规定了工作定额的农业社里，采用固定补贴的办法好呢，还是采用百分数的办法好呢？
    所谓固定补贴的办法和按百分数补贴的办法，实质全是属于“定额补贴，定工生产”办法的范围之内，不过，前者以绝对数（固定数）规定“定额补贴”多少劳动日；后者以相对数（百分数）规定“定额补贴”百分之几的劳动日。再具体一点说：固定补贴的办法，是按预计数计算的，将来实际数的增加或减少，不再随着调整；百分数的方法，是按实际数计算的，百分数在预计报酬的时候只起试算作用，并不以预计数计算应补贴的劳动日数。
    由此可见，采用固定补贴办法好还是采用百分数办法好的问题，实质上就是以预计数来计算定额补贴好还是以实际数来计算定额补贴好的问题。现在我们就这个问题来分析一下：
    一、在已实行“包工包产”制的农业社里，虽然一般说来全年全社总共实际所作的劳动日数和预计的劳动日数不会发生差额；但是，各等劳力之间却可能发生差额。假定：上等劳力误工多了（因事或因病），中等和下等劳力势必要多干些活，则全年平均上等劳力实际所作劳动日数必然要比预计的少些，而中等和下等劳力要比预计的多些。如果以实际数来计算定额补贴，便会产生如下两种不合理的情况：1、在误工多的上等劳力本人来说，少干了活少得劳动日，是合理的；但在比照上等劳力全年平均实际所作劳动日数计算补贴的工作人员（如社主任）来说，并不因为上等劳力少干了活，他也少干活；可能实际情况恰恰相反，他积极负责多干了活，硬要他随着“水降船落”，岂不冤枉！2、在多干活的中等和下等劳力来说，由于上等劳力误工过多而发生社内劳动力缺乏的现象，必须额外多干些活来弥补；这种额外多干的活多得的劳动日归劳动者所得是合理的。但是，对比照中等劳动力全年平均实际所作劳动日数计算补贴的工作人员来说，并不因为中等和下等劳力额外多干了活，他也一定额外多干了活；如果他也随着“水涨船高”，显然也是不合理的。
    二、在遇到比较大的自然条件的变化的时候，农业社一般要总动员；干部应当带头，岂能袖手旁观！这就是说，干部也多干了活，干部超过了生产定工，多劳多得。如果按实际数计算，就会发生这种现象：干部一方面自己多干活多得一份；另一方面，社员所作劳动日数增加，补贴部分再相应增加。这种双重收入的情况是合理的吗？
    可见，在已实行“包工包产”制的农业社或虽未实行“包工包产”制，但已规定工作定额的农业社，干部的补贴都不能按平均实际数作比，而应当同预计数作比。肯定了以预计数作比合理，那么，用绝对数固定补贴的劳动日数不仅比较合理，而且明确，计算起来也方便。相反，以实际数作比按百分数计算的办法，反而有很多不合理的地方。
