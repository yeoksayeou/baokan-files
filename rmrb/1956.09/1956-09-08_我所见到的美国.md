What I Saw in America
    Xie Jialin
    (Continued)
    Racial Discrimination
    The United States has many social problems, and racial discrimination is becoming increasingly serious. The population in the United States, especially in the big cities, is very diverse. Among these different races, people of color are subjected to varying degrees of discrimination. Among those who are discriminated against, Black people are at the very bottom, suffering the most humiliation. As Black people's efforts to fight for their dignity and equality increase, this problem is almost at the point of explosion. Some Americans believe that "discrimination against Black people is America's greatest shame." Anyone who has seen the Black neighborhoods in New York, Chicago, and other places would agree with this statement. The situation in the South is, of course, even worse. The windows of the houses where Black people live are usually replaced with newspapers or boards. Large families often live in only one or two rooms. The buildings are usually the oldest and most dilapidated in the city, but the rent is surprisingly expensive. I once saw a Black family (a couple and two children) living in a broken-down car because they couldn't afford rent. When white people hire Black people to work, if something is lost or something happens in the house, the police will first torture the Black person, as if he were a born thief. Their various experiences are too numerous to mention. After recounting some of the discrimination they had suffered, a Black man said to me sadly, "What crime have we (Black people) committed to deserve this torment?" Black people generally have a lower level of education because they simply don't get the opportunity to receive higher education. Many universities used to openly refuse to admit Black people. Recently, they only admit a few Black people to appear enlightened. Especially in medical schools, the number of Black and Jewish students is strictly within a limited "quota."
    Besides Black people, Asians are also discriminated against. Chinese people who have lived in the United States have rarely not experienced unpleasantness when looking for housing. Even though the newspaper clearly advertises vacant rooms for rent, when the landlord opens the door and sees a Chinese person, the room is often already "just rented out." A professorship is a respected title in the United States, but a Chinese professor has considerable difficulty living in a better residential area.
        "Free Development"
    Because American politics is manipulated behind the scenes by capitalists, and any economic planning and restrictions will always affect the interests of some capitalist groups, "free development" has become a characteristic of American society, even though this "freedom" sometimes "develops" to bizarre extremes. One example I saw myself was in 1953, when I was responsible for the design and manufacture of a special accelerator in Chicago. This was being done for a private medical research institute. Even though the effectiveness of this accelerator was not entirely certain at the time, and it would cost nearly a million dollars, at the same time, the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission hired several professors at the University of Chicago to begin the same work. If the experiment was very successful, then these two expensive accelerators, which were the only ones of their kind in the United States, should not be concentrated in one city. If it was unsuccessful, there was even less reason to waste money. In the United States, however, this kind of thinking is generally absent. Free competition is a matter of course. Private individuals compete with private individuals, private organizations compete with government agencies, and government departments compete with each other. This creates many chaotic phenomena in American society. The economic chaos under this social system cannot be compared with the superiority of planned economy under the socialist system.
    The research work of American universities is mostly commissioned by government departments or industrial units, mainly on topics with practical purposes. Therefore, the ratio of "applied research" to "basic research" in American science is greatly unbalanced. This problem has been repeatedly raised by far-sighted scientists, but under the premise of "free development," it is difficult to find a solution. This can be said to be a dark cloud over the future of American science. Another darker fact about American science is the lack of scientific talent. The rate at which the United States trains graduates in science and engineering has been surpassed by the Soviet Union, which is well known. With the lure of dollars, the United States has plundered some accomplished scientists from other capitalist countries. However, since the number is limited, it has also deeply aroused the dissatisfaction of scientists in other countries. The cost of studying and living in the United States is extremely high. Students with ordinary economic conditions need considerable perseverance and struggle to complete their graduate education. This is especially true for married graduate students. When I was teaching in the physics department at the University of Oregon, one of my very good graduate students, who was doing his doctoral dissertation with me, finally gave up his research work due to economic difficulties.
          Loyalty Oath
    The U.S. government not only fails to give sufficient attention and support to science education, but also persecutes scientists who are relatively progressive or enlightened. The famous physicist Oppenheimer was dismissed by the Atomic Energy Commission because his wife and brother were Communists and because he once opposed the research of hydrogen bombs. The director of the Bureau of Standards, physicist Condon, also left his post because he offended politicians. Professor Pauling of the California Institute of Technology was not allowed to go to Europe to attend conferences or give lectures. If Einstein were not a world authority, and the reactionaries had some scruples, he would have been labeled a "red" by the Un-American Activities Committee long ago, based on his opposition to the "loyalty oath." The implementation of the "loyalty oath" can be said to be the greatest irony of America's hypocrisy about "freedom." The Constitution clearly stipulates that people have political freedom, but if you work in government agencies in some states, you must sign a "loyalty oath" stating that you are not a Communist. If you are a Communist, of course you will lose your job. Even ordinary people who insist on the principle of political freedom and refuse to sign will also be dismissed. If you do not reveal your identity as a party member, then if it is found out, you will be severely punished for the crime of perjury. Due to refusing to sign this "loyalty oath" that deprives people of political freedom, many professors working in state universities lost their jobs.
    In fact, not only are scientists being persecuted now, but the American capitalist social system has long changed from promoting science in the early stage of capitalism to hindering it. Although color television in the United States has not yet been researched to perfection, it could have been "launched" long ago. The reason why factory owners have been slow to produce it in large quantities is that their investment in black and white television has not yet been fully recovered. They want to wait until more people have bought black and white televisions before they promote color televisions, so that they can force people to replace their machines again, so that they can make more money. With the development of electronics, the automation of industrial production, which the United States originally had the conditions to vigorously promote, has made little progress to this day. The reason can be seen from discussions in newspapers and magazines: "After automation, how can the unemployment problem be avoided? Will overproduction cause economic panic?" As mentioned earlier, American capitalism is an economically extremely unstable system, and now the progress of science has reached a point where it is incompatible with that system.
      The American People Love Peace
    After staying in the United States for eight years, summarizing the impressions gained over these years, I feel that under the control of capitalists, American society not only deprives people of political freedom and economic security, but even more seriously, the propaganda organs controlled by capitalists are anesthetizing and poisoning their minds, causing them to seek stimulation like the end of the world and blindly pursue enjoyment. However, despite these shortcomings in American society, I cannot but admit many good qualities of the American people. In my personal experience, the American people strongly love peace. In these eight years, I have not met an American who did not express extreme aversion when talking about war. The American people are also enthusiastic and compassionate humanitarians. I remember that in 1949, a poor worker's child in the West fell into a very deep abandoned mine shaft. At that time, the child was still groaning and calling for help at the bottom of the shaft. Not only did the nearby residents come to participate in the excavation and rescue work, but after learning the news from newspapers and radio, some mining experts and engineers also brought bulldozers and other equipment from other cities to participate in the work spontaneously, excavating day and night. From the spontaneous and selfless labor of these people to save people, we can very clearly see their humanitarian spirit. In addition, a characteristic of Americans is that they work quickly and efficiently, which is manifested in various forms and aspects. The example that I personally experienced most deeply was when I was working on the accelerator in Chicago. Urgently needed equipment that could not be bought locally could often be transported from warehouses or factories on the East and West Coasts and delivered the next day, as long as the factory's sales agent was notified the day before. General business can be resolved by telephone, and "official documents" are reduced to a minimum. At the same time, because they have a lot of contact with electrical appliances, machinery, etc. in their daily lives, young American scientific workers seem to be more creative and have the ability to work independently and solve problems on their own.
    The Forces of Democracy Are Growing
    Finally, I would like to point out that the American people have a glorious tradition of fighting for democracy. Although the current ruling group in the United States has used various methods to blind the eyes of the people and paralyze their judgment, the forces of democracy and peace are still growing in the United States. The movement of Black people to fight for their due rights, the birth of the Progressive Party, the opposition of the American people to the war of aggression against Korea, and the response to the signature campaign for the World Peace Congress all clearly show that the awareness of the American people is increasing day by day. Conversely, the current ruling group is encountering rebuffs everywhere on international issues and is caught in a dilemma in domestic contradictions, struggling to cope. We have every reason to believe that the emergence of a truly democratic and free America will not be too distant. (Attached picture)

    我所见到的美国
    谢家麟
    （下）
    种族歧视
    美国的社会问题很多，而其中种族歧视已是发展到愈来愈严重的程度。美国，尤其是在几个大城市里，人种是十分复杂的。在这些不同的人种之间，有色人种受着不同程度的歧视，在这被歧视的阶层中，黑人是压在最下面，最受凌辱的了。由于黑人争取自己的尊严与平等的努力日益增大，这个问题已经差不多到了要爆发的程度。有些美国人认为：“对黑人的歧视，是美国最大的耻辱”。看过纽约、芝加哥等地黑人区的人，谁能不同意这句话呢？南方的情形当然更不用说了，黑人居住的房子，窗玻璃照例是用报纸或木板代替的。一大家人，往往只住在一两间房子里。建筑物照例是市区中最陈旧古老的，而房租却又出奇地昂贵。我曾经看到过一家黑人（夫妻和两个小孩）因为租不起房子，全家住在一辆破汽车里。白人雇用黑人做工，如果家里丢了东西或出了什么事，警察首先便要折磨这个黑人，就像他是天生的贼骨头似的。他们的种种遭遇，真是说不胜说。一位黑人在申诉他们所受的一些歧视之后，曾沉痛地向我说：“我们（黑人）做了什么罪恶应该受这个折磨呢？”黑人的文化水平一般较低，因为他们根本得不到受高等教育的机会。许多大学在以前是公开不收黑人的，近来也不过收几个黑人表示开明而已。尤其是医学院，黑人与犹太学生的人数，是严格地在有限的“定额”之内的。
    除了黑人以外，东方人便算是被歧视的对象了。在美国住过的中国人，很少没有经历过找房子时遇到的不快。明明报上登着空房招租的广告，但当房东开门看到中国人时，往往这房子是已经“方才租出去”了。教授在美国是受尊敬的头衔，但是一个中国教授想住在较好的住宅区也有相当大的困难。
        “自由发展”
    由于美国政治是被资本家在幕后操纵，而任何经济上的计划与限制，总会影响到某一些资本集团的利益，因此，“自由发展”便成了美国社会的一个特征，虽然这个“自由”有时“发展”到离奇古怪的程度。我自己见到的一个例子，就是在1953年我在芝加哥负责一件特殊的加速器的设计与制造工作，这是为一民间医学研究机构做的。尽管这种加速器的成效在当时还不能十分肯定，而且要用到将近百万美元的费用，然而在这同时，美国原子能委员会却在芝加哥大学请了几位教授开始了同样的工作。如果这个试验的效果很成功，那么这两个费用庞大而且是美国仅有的这种加速器是不应该集中在一个城市的。如果不成功，更没有理由浪费。在美国一般却是没有这种想法的，自由竞争是天经地义的事，私人和私人在竞争，民间团体和政府机构在竞争，政府各部门也在彼此竞争，这就造成了美国社会的许多混乱现象。这种社会制度下经济的混乱情况与社会主义制度下计划经济的优越性，是很显然不能相比的。
    美国大学的研究工作，绝大多数是受政府部门或工业单位委托进行的，主要是一些具有实用目的的题目。因此，美国科学的“实用研究”与“基础研究”的比例，便大大失了平衡。这个问题曾为有远见的科学家们一再地提起，然而在“自由发展”的前提下，也难有解决的办法。这可以说是美国科学远景的一朵乌云。另一件对美国科学更为暗淡的事实，就是科学人材的缺乏。美国培养理工科系毕业生的速率已被苏联超过，这是大家所熟知的事。以美元的诱惑，美国曾从其他资本主义国家掠夺了一些有造诣的科学家。然而数量既然有限，同时也深深引起别国科学工作者的不满。美国读书与生活费用极高，一般经济条件的学生要坚持受完研究院的教育，是需要相当的毅力与挣扎的。这情形尤以结了婚的研究生为甚。我在奥勒冈大学物理系教书的时候，随我做博士论文的一个成绩很好的研究生，就因为经济困难，最后终于放弃了研究工作。
          忠诚宣誓
    美国政府不仅对科学教育不给予足够的注意与支持，而且对比较前进或开明的科学家加以迫害。著名的物理学家奥本海姆就因为太太与兄弟是共产党员同时他在某时期一度不赞成氢弹的研究而被原子能委员会辞退了。标准局局长、物理学家康顿，也因为得罪了政客而离职。加利福尼亚州理工学院的鲍令教授，是不许到欧洲去开会或讲学的。爱因斯坦若不是世界的权威，反动派有所顾忌，按他对“忠诚宣誓”所发表的反对的意见，也早该被非美活动委员会戴上“红帽子”了。“忠诚宣誓”的实施可以说是对美国挂羊头卖狗肉的“自由”的最大讽刺。宪法上明明规定人民有政治的自由，但是你若在某些州的政府机关工作，就必须在“忠诚宣誓”上签字声明不是共产党员。是共产党当然要丢掉工作，即或是坚持政治自由的原则而拒绝签字的一般人民也是同样地要被解职。若不暴露党员的身份，则一旦查出来又要被加以严重的宣“假誓”的罪。由于拒绝在这个剥夺人民政治自由的“忠诚宣誓”上签名，许多在州立大学工作的教授们失掉了饭碗。
    其实，不但科学家现在受到迫害，就是对科学本身，美国的资本主义社会制度也早已从资本主义发展初期对科学的推进变为阻碍。五彩电视在美国虽然还没有研究到十分完善，然而是已经早可以“问世”了。工厂老板迟迟不大量生产的原因，是他们在黑白电视方面的投资还没有完全收回，要等到更多的人们买了黑白电视机之后，他们再推销五彩电视机，那时候可以强迫人民再换一次机器，这样他们可以多赚一笔钱。工业生产的自动化，随着电子学的发展，美国原也有条件大力推广的，迄今举步不前的原因，由报纸杂志上的讨论可以看出，是发生了“自动化以后，失业问题怎能避免？生产过剩会不会引起经济恐慌？”这类的问题。如前面所说，美国资本主义是一个经济上极不稳定的制度，现在科学的进步已到了与那个制度不相容的时候了。
      美国人民爱好和平
    在美国羁留了八年，总结一下这些年所得的印象，就是觉得美国社会在资本家控制之下，不但人民在政治上没有自由，经济上没有保障，而更甚的是即便在思想上也受着资本家掌握的宣传机构的麻醉与毒害，因而像末日来临似地找寻着刺激，盲目地追求着享受。然而，尽管美国社会存在着这些缺点，我却不能不承认美国人民的许多好处。按个人的体会，美国人民是强烈地爱好和平的，在这八年里我还没有碰到一个美国人谈起战争不表示极端厌恶的。美国人民也是富于热情与同情心的人道主义者。记得在1949年西部曾发生一个穷工人的孩儿滑到了很深的废弃的矿坑里的事。当时小孩还在坑底呻吟呼救，于是，不但附近居民都来参加了挖掘营救的工作，而且从报纸与无线电得知这个消息后，一些挖矿专家，工程师带着挖土机等也都自动地从外埠赶来参加工作，日夜不断地挖掘。从这些人为了救人的自发的忘我的劳动，很可以看出他们的人道主义精神。另外，美国人的一个特征就是做起事来速度快，效率高，这是以各种形式表现在各种方面的。我个人体会最深的例子，就是在芝加哥做加速器工作时，当地买不到的急需器材，只要头一天通知工厂的售货代理人，往往在第二天就可以从东西海岸的仓库或工厂里运来交货。一般业务都可用电话解决，“公文”是被减少到最低的限度了。同时，由于日常生活对电器、机械等接触很多，美国年青的科学工作者似乎较富于创造性，并有独立工作的能力和自己动手解决问题的本领。
    民主的力量在生长中
    最后，我愿意指出，美国人民是具有争取民主斗争的光荣传统的，尽管目前美国的统治集团，用了种种方法，蒙蔽了人民的眼睛，麻醉了人民的判断，但是民主和平的力量，在美国仍是在不断地生长之中。黑人争取自己应有的权利的运动、进步党的诞生，美国人民对侵朝战争的反对，对世界保卫和平大会签名运动的响应等，都明白地表示美国人民的觉悟正在日益提高。而相反地，现在的统治集团正在国际的问题上，到处遭受白眼，在国内的矛盾上，捉襟见肘，穷于应付，我们有充分的理由相信，真正民主自由的美国的出现，不会是太遥远的事。（附图片）
