Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 4th -- The Taihu Lake water network region of Jiangsu Province, which has reaped a bumper harvest of early rice, is now seeing bustling activity in state-owned companies, supply and marketing cooperatives, joint state-private stores, and cooperative stores. After selling their new rice, farmers are purchasing agricultural tools, cotton cloth, and daily necessities. According to statistics from fourteen counties including Wujiang, Wuxian, and Zhenze, the sales volume of daily necessities such as sugar, socks, bed sheets, and woolen yarn in August increased by 30% to 150% compared to July. Sales of autumn and winter goods are still rising.

The farmers in the Taihu Lake water network region not only need more goods this year than in previous years, but also have new requirements for colors, varieties, and quality. Last year, farmers in this area only wanted ordinary coarse yarn towels, yarn-soled socks, and two or three jiao toothbrushes. This year, however, many people are buying higher-quality colored stripe towels, thread-soled socks, and four or five jiao toothbrushes. High-end printed bed sheets, pillowcases, and woolen yarn, which did not sell well in the past, are now also seeing increased sales. Female members of agricultural production cooperatives such as Hongguang and Hongxing in Wuxi County have also requested that the Wuxi State-Owned Department Store supply brightly colored snowflake cotton sweaters for women. Middle-aged and elderly members have reported that the sleeves of the open-front health shirts they like to wear are too short and the waist is too large, making them not warm enough, and have suggested that the production departments improve them.

Currently, the state-owned commercial departments in the Taihu Lake water network region are stepping up the processing and purchasing of autumn and winter goods to welcome the arrival of an even more prosperous season for commodity sales.

    早稻丰收后的太湖地区
    市场出现繁荣景象
    新华社南京4日电　获得早稻丰收的江苏省太湖水网地区，现在国营公司、供销合作社、公私合营商店和合作商店里顾客来来往往，农民出售新稻以后，购买农具、棉布和日用百货。据吴江、吴县和震泽等十四个县统计，8月份食糖、袜子、被单和绒线等日用百货的销售量比7月份增加30％到150％。目前秋冬商品销售量仍在上升。
    太湖水网地区农民今年需要的商品不仅数量上比往年增多，对花色、品种和质量方面也有了新的要求。这个地区的农民去年只要普通的粗纱毛巾、纱夹底袜和两三角钱一支的牙刷，今年却有不少人购买质量较高的彩条毛巾、线夹底袜和四五角钱一支的牙刷。往年销路不大的高档印花被单、枕套和绒线等，现在销售量也增加了。无锡县红光、红星等农业生产合作社的女社员，还要求无锡市国营百货公司供应色泽鲜艳的雪花女棉毛衫，中年和老年社员反映他们爱穿的开襟卫生衫袖子太短，腰身太大，不保暖，建议生产部门改进。
    目前太湖水网地区的国营商业部门，正在加紧加工采购秋冬商品，以迎接商品销售更旺的季节到来。
