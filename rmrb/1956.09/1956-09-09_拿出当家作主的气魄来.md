　　Show the Spirit of Being Masters of Our Own House

　　On September 7th, the Japanese Cabinet decided to agree to Japanese Prime Minister Ichiro Hatoyama's visit to the Soviet Union in order to break the deadlock in Soviet-Japanese negotiations and enable the issue of normalizing Soviet-Japanese relations to be resolved.

　　From the reaction of Japanese public opinion, it can be seen that all levels of Japanese society are very concerned about the issue of Soviet-Japanese negotiations, because the restoration of normal relations between Japan and the Soviet Union has a great impact on the practical interests of the Japanese people, on Japan's position in international affairs, and on the easing of the situation in the Far East. However, the Soviet-Japanese negotiations that the Japanese people have been eagerly anticipating have been full of twists and turns and have been interrupted repeatedly.

　　What is the crux of these twists and turns? Past facts have proved that the Soviet side sought to reach an agreement with an attitude of reconciliation and respect for the interests of both sides, and it made significant concessions on many issues. In the final stage of the Moscow negotiations, the Japanese negotiators also publicly stated that they had reached the point where a treaty could be signed. However, the Japanese government was constrained by foreign pressure and factional struggles within the ruling party, and it hesitated and could not make up its mind. As a result, the Soviet-Japanese negotiations fell into a deadlock, and the disputes within Japan intensified. The United States took advantage of this situation to exert increasingly rude pressure and interference on Japan. The recent chaotic phenomena in Japanese politics surrounding the Soviet-Japanese negotiations are really not a decent thing for a modern country.

　　Prime Minister Hatoyama's decision to visit the Soviet Union shows that most politicians in Japan have realized the need to respect Japanese public opinion and follow the development of the situation. However, whether the deadlock in Soviet-Japanese negotiations can be quickly broken in the future and whether normal relations between Japan and the Soviet Union can be quickly restored still depends on whether the Japanese government is determined to reach an agreement with the Soviet Union. If the Japanese ruling figures can indeed disregard foreign interference, not be influenced by those who value the interests of factional struggles above all else, and independently and autonomously adopt propositions that conform to the requirements of the broad masses of the Japanese people and the development direction of the current international situation, and act decisively, the negotiations between Japan and the Soviet Union will obviously not be difficult to reach an agreement under conditions that are beneficial to both sides. However, people have also noticed that just as the Japanese Cabinet meeting decided to agree to Hatoyama's visit to the Soviet Union, some people within the Japanese Liberal Democratic Party are still continuing to carry out activities to obstruct and sabotage it, and some people also advocate that Hatoyama's actions should be decided only after "seeking the opinions of friendly countries," and this friendly country clearly refers to the United States. Many signs indicate that the United States is currently preparing to take new measures to further complicate the Soviet-Japanese negotiations. Faced with these factors, this makes the courage of Japanese ruling figures even more necessary. There is an old Chinese saying: "If you are timid and indecisive, how much of your body will be left!" For the sake of Japan's future, it is necessary for Japan to get rid of this very unfavorable predicament.

　　The Chinese people are very understanding and sympathetic to the current situation of the Japanese people. We sincerely hope that the Japanese government can make up its mind, show the spirit of being masters of its own house, establish peaceful coexistence and friendly cooperation relations with all its neighbors, and play a role in safeguarding peace in the Far East.

    拿出当家作主的气魄来
    本月7日，日本内阁决定同意日本首相鸠山一郎访问苏联，以便打破苏日谈判的僵局，使日苏关系正常化的问题能够得到解决。
    从日本的舆论反应中可以看出，日本各个阶层对于苏日谈判问题都是十分关切的，因为日本和苏联恢复正常关系，对于日本国民的实际利益，对于日本在国际事务中的地位和远东局势的缓和，都有很大的影响。但是，日本人民引领而望的苏日谈判，却是历经周折，一再中断。
    造成这些周折的症结何在呢？过去的事实证明：苏联方面是以和解的、尊重双方利益的态度谋求达成协议的，它在许多问题上作了重大让步。在莫斯科谈判的最后阶段，日本方面的谈判代表也公开表示，已经达到可以签订和约的地步了。可是，日本政府却受到国外压力和执政党内部派系斗争的牵掣，徘徊犹豫，拿不定主意。结果苏日谈判陷于僵局，日本国内的意见纷争也更加剧烈。美国又借助于这种情势，对日本施加越来越粗暴的压力和干涉。日本政局中最近围绕苏日谈判问题出现的混乱现象，对于一个现代国家来说，实在不是什么体面的事情。
    鸠山首相决定访问苏联，这表明日本的大部分政界人士已经认识到有必要尊重日本舆论，顺应形势的发展。但是，日苏谈判的僵局今后能否迅速打开，日苏的正常关系能否迅速恢复，关键问题仍然在于日本政府是否下定了和苏联达成协议的决心。如果日本的执政人士果然能够不顾外来的干涉，不受那些把派系斗争利益看得高于一切的人的影响，独立自主地采取符合于日本广大人民的要求、符合当前国际形势发展方向的主张，毅然行事，日、苏之间的谈判显然是不难在有利于双方的条件下达成协议的。但是，人们也注意到，正当日本内阁会议决定同意鸠山访苏的时候，日本自由民主党内却还有一些人在继续进行阻挠破坏的活动，也有人主张要“征求友邦的意见”之后才决定鸠山的行止，而这个友邦显然指的是美国，许多迹象显示目前美国正在准备向日本采取使苏日谈判更加复杂化的新措施。面对这些因素，这就更加需要日本执政人士的魄力。中国有句古话说：“畏首畏尾，身其余几！”为日本的前途着想，日本有必要摆脱这种对自己十分不利的窘境。
    中国人民对于日本人民目前的处境是十分理解而且同情的。我们诚恳地希望日本政府能够打定主意，拿出当家作主的气魄来，同它的所有邻国建立和平共处、友好合作的关系，在维护远东和平的事业中发挥作用。
