Xinhua News Agency report: The more than 28,000 mu of nurseries established by agricultural cooperatives in Shanxi Province using scattered plots of land are neatly planted in rows and ridges, with full and even seedlings. Most nurseries can produce over 10,000 seedlings per mu in the autumn. This year, Ruicheng County has 51 cooperatives, each cultivating an average of 6.7 mu of seedlings, which will not only supply seedlings for the entire county but also support neighboring counties. Young people and women throughout the province have cultivated 360,000 pots of seedlings at home. Dong Tiezhu, an activist from Beichen Township, Gaoping County, who attended the Yan'an Five Provinces (Regions) Youth Afforestation Conference, helped 63 young people establish a 7-mu public nursery and also cultivate an average of 13 pots of seedlings per person on scattered plots.

Experience in Shanxi Province over the past few years has shown that planting seedlings results in a higher survival rate than sowing tree seeds. Therefore, forestry departments at all levels are generally assisting and relying on agricultural cooperatives in the plains areas to carry out seedling cultivation work. The Provincial Forestry Department recently formulated "Implementation Measures (Draft) for Civil-Operated and Publicly Assisted Seedling Cultivation Work" to subsidize agricultural cooperatives in widespread seedling cultivation.

    山西农业社栽培树苗
    据新华社讯　山西省农业社利用零星土地建立的二万八千多亩苗圃，横顺成行，垅满苗齐，多数苗圃在秋季每亩可以出圃苗木一万株以上。芮城县今年有五十一个社每社平均育苗六亩七分，不但可供给全县以种苗，还可支援邻县一部分。全省青年和妇女在家中培育了三十六万盆树苗。高平县北陈乡出席延安五省（区）青年造林会议的积极分子董铁柱帮助六十三个青年除建立了七亩公共苗圃外，每人还平均零星育苗十三盆。
    山西省几年来的经验证明，栽植树苗比播种树籽成活率高。因此，各级林业部门普遍协助和依靠平原地区农业社开展育苗工作。省林业厅最近又制定出“民营公助育苗工作实施办法（草案）”资助农业社普遍育苗。
