    The Great Bulgarian Writer Ivan Vazov
    —Commemorating the 35th Anniversary of Ivan Vazov's Death
    Yang Tieying
    September 22nd of this year marks the 35th anniversary of the death of the great Bulgarian writer Ivan Vazov. Vazov was a meritorious builder of Bulgarian national literature, and is the glory and pride of the Bulgarian people. From the very first moment he consciously used literature as a weapon for combat, he made his creations serve the overall task of the national liberation movement. Almost every major event in Bulgarian history that Vazov encountered in his glorious life is reflected in his works. Vazov's vast body of work not only had a tremendous impact on the development of Bulgarian literature, but also continues to inspire and educate the Bulgarian people. His works greatly enriched the Bulgarian language. Professor Romansky, Academician of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, said: "Ivan Vazov's vocabulary is the richest, both in quantity and meaning; totaling 45,000 different words. He very successfully utilized their many subtle differences."
    Although the complex social conditions of the time led Vazov to fail to understand the historical mission of the Bulgarian working class that emerged at the end of the 19th century, and even revealed unhealthy political views in some of his later works; this cannot affect the central position he should occupy in the history of Bulgarian literature. The Bulgarian People's Government and the Bulgarian Communist Party give Vazov a very high evaluation and cherish his literary legacy.
    Vazov was born on July 9, 1850, in the small town of Sopot on the southern slopes of the Stara Planina Mountains. His father was a merchant dealing in furs and tobacco, and his mother was very gentle and the most literate woman in the town. When Vazov was seven years old, he was sent to the local primary school. A teacher educated in Russia taught him Russian. After graduating from primary school, his father sent him to the town of Karlovo. Life in this small city, famous for being the birthplace of the great poet and revolutionary Hristo Botev, was decisive in Vazov's glorious life. In Karlovo, he worked as an assistant to a primary school principal, teaching children to read. The school had a large library containing many Russian books. Here, Vazov avidly read the works of Pushkin, Lermontov, Gogol, Belinsky, and Grigorovich. Vazov once said: "This library played a major role in my growth, without it, I would have achieved nothing. ... My new tastes arose from Russian literature."
    In Bulgarian literature, the patriotic poems and novels of excellent poets and writers such as Vasily Drumev, Georgi Rakovski, and Petko Slaveykov had a profound impact on the young Vazov's mind. Later, Vazov learned French at the Plovdiv High School and read the works of Hugo, Béranger, Lamartine, and Molière. After graduating from high school in 1868, Vazov was called back to his hometown by his father to help in the family store. However, this future writer and poet clearly lacked the temperament and talent of a merchant, and in more than two years, he did not learn the skills of doing business, but wrote many poems. This was his first collection of poems, "May Flowers" (1868-1870). However, this collection was not the beginning of his history as a national poet. Because during this period, his uninhibited talent had not yet found its path, and the tide of the people's revolutionary struggle had not yet impacted him. The passion of first love made this collection sentimental.
    In the spring of 1870, Vazov was sent to his uncle in Romania. His uncle was his father's store agent. Vazov's father hoped that he would educate Ivan to be his good assistant and successor. But this hope was dashed again. However, the two years Vazov spent living in Romania were a major turning point in his glorious life. At that time, many Bulgarian revolutionary exiles gathered in Bucharest, Galați, and Brăila in Romania. Vazov traveled back and forth between these cities and met many Bulgarian revolutionaries, especially his acquaintance with the outstanding revolutionary leader Vasil Levski, and the great revolutionary, genius poet Hristo Botev. All this had an undeniable and significant impact on the growth of Vazov's political and aesthetic ideas.
    In Romania, Vazov published many poems in newspapers and periodicals founded by Bulgarian revolutionary exiles. His famous "Pine Tree" (later included in the collection "Flag and Lyre") was written during this period. In the poem, he expressed his infinite concern and deep love for the motherland by lamenting an old pine tree blown down by a storm. This poem earned him great prestige. And Vazov also believed that this poem was the true beginning of his literary life.
    In 1872, Vazov returned to his homeland and worked as a teacher in a primary school in Svilengrad for a period. Among the youth, he actively spread patriotic ideas and prepared for armed uprisings. Soon, the Turkish police discovered this dangerous teacher and began investigating and monitoring his actions. Vazov was forced to leave Svilengrad and return to his hometown of Sopot. Soon, he ran to Bernik (now Dimitrovgrad) and worked as a French translator on the railway.
    In the revolutionary history of the Bulgarian people, 1873 was a painful year. On February 7 of this year, the brutal Turkish oppressors strangled Vasil Levski, the outstanding son of the Bulgarian people. The bloody suppression did not frustrate the revolutionary will of the masses. On the contrary, this heavy loss further strengthened the determination of the masses to fight for national liberation.
    In the autumn of 1874, Vazov returned to Sopot. The tide of revolution also impacted the residents of this small town: preparations for the uprising were carried out secretly. Vazov wholeheartedly devoted himself to the preparations for the uprising. During this period, he wrote many patriotic poems reflecting the emotions, will, and aspirations of the people (most of which were also included in the collection "Flag and Lyre"). Vazov actively participated in the work of the secret revolutionary committee led by Todor Kableshkov, a comrade-in-arms of Vasil Levski. He used passionate poems to inspire the people's resentment and encourage them to dedicate themselves to the struggle for national liberation. Due to the persecution of the Turkish oppressors, he fled to Romania again in 1875.
    After fleeing to Romania, Vazov published the collection of poems "Flag and Lyre" in Bucharest in 1876. In this collection, the poet described the miserable life of the Bulgarian people under the oppression of feudal Turkish rule, called on the people to win precious freedom through resolute struggle, praised the heroic spirit of the Bulgarian people fighting bravely to get rid of their enslaved fate ("The Insurgents of Panagyurishte", "Volunteers", "Avengers", "Freedom or Death", etc.), and lamented the failure of the people's uprising. The poet also vowed that when his people were still groaning and crying under the iron heel of foreign invaders, he would only sing for justice and freedom. The defeat of the famous April Uprising in Bulgarian history in 1876 gave Vazov a great shock. Sorrow for the suffering people, hatred for the feudal Turkish oppressors, and belief in the beautiful future of the motherland all condensed into many moving poems. These poems were published in 1877 under the title "Bulgarian Sorrows." In this collection, Vazov also angrily exposed the accomplice policies and corrupt morals of the European bourgeois governments ("Politics", "To Europe", etc.). In the spring of 1877, Russia declared war on Turkey and defeated Turkey in 1878, liberating Bulgaria. The Bulgarian people's love and gratitude for the Russian people who helped them get rid of the 500 years of oppression of the Turkish feudal empire is fully reflected in Vazov's collection of poems "Salvation" published in 1878. "Flag and Lyre," "Bulgarian Sorrows," and "Salvation," these three consecutive collections of poems, can be said to be a portrayal of the life, struggle, emotions, and aspirations of the Bulgarian people in the late period of Turkish rule and the years when it was overthrown.
    In 1879, Vazov served as the president of the local court in the city of Berkovitsa in northwestern Bulgaria. Here, he wrote a beautiful and charming narrative poem "Stone Hill." Using the love story of the poor youth Kamen and the daughter of the wealthy peasant Tsena as a clue, he not only praised the people's deep hatred for the Turkish oppressors, but also described the struggle of the poor people in the countryside against the landlords. In 1880, Vazov went to Plovdiv and served as a representative of the Eastern Rumelia Regional Assembly. In Plovdiv, Vazov and several others initiated the organization of a literary group called "Science" and published a magazine of the same name. This was one of the major events in the development history of modern Bulgarian literature. Vazov was elected as the editor-in-chief of the "Science" magazine. Many of his famous works were first published in "Science," such as the novella "Mitrophan and Taurmidolsky" (1881, then titled "Mitrophan") and "Exiles" (1883), etc. The former is a satirical novel that criticizes the greed, incompetence, and inability of the bourgeois regime after Bulgaria gained its freedom. The latter describes the real life of Bulgarian political exiles in Romania at the end of Turkish rule.
    The series of poems "Epic of the Forgotten" (included in the 1881 collection "Lyre") occupies an important position in the history of modern Bulgarian literature. In the poem, Vazov praised those famous and unknown heroes who sacrificed their lives for national liberation, and condemned the bourgeois elements who enriched themselves and exploited the masses after gaining power.
    In early 1885, the "Science" magazine was forced to cease publication due to the government's cessation of funding. However, Vazov quickly founded the "Dawn" magazine in March of the same year and continued to work hard to build Bulgarian critical realism literature.
    In the autumn of 1885, the Eastern Rumelia Autonomous Region and the Principality of Bulgaria were unified. But at this time, King Milan of Serbia launched a war of aggression against Bulgaria, which had fought alongside Serbia against their common enemy, the Turkish feudal empire. Fierce fighting took place in the village of Slivnitsa near Sofia. Vazov visited this battlefield and published the famous epic "Slivnitsa." During this period, he also wrote many moving short stories. For example, "Velko in the War," "Has He Come?" and so on. The basic ideas and emotions intertwined in Vazov's works during this period are fervent patriotism and noble humanitarianism. In his poems and novels, while praising the bravery of the Bulgarian people who rose up to defend their motherland, Vazov also pointed out the fratricidal nature of this war with deep melancholy, and showed noble humanitarianism to the Serbian people.
    In the autumn of 1886, an armed coup took place in Bulgaria under the instigation of foreign imperialism. With the establishment of the Stambolov bourgeois dictatorship, Bulgaria began a frantic persecution of all people who advocated democracy and favored friendship with Russia. Vazov was forced to flee to Russia in 1887, where he lived for nearly two years. Here, Vazov felt "the sorrow and pain of losing his motherland," and thus, "the vigorous life of the motherland during the April Uprising era" was revived in his memory. This resulted in "Under the Yoke." The great significance of this world-famous novel lies not only in the fact that it is an unprecedented masterpiece in Bulgarian literature, nor only in the fact that it has earned Bulgarian literature international status, but also in the fact that the author profoundly educated the Bulgarian people: only well-organized armed struggle in all aspects can guarantee victory, and it set a model for Bulgarian writers to be loyal to life.
    Short stories occupy a very important position in Vazov's literary legacy. He wrote many short stories after returning to China in 1889. "'La Traviata'" (1895) is an angry protest against the Stambolov dictatorship. "A Bulgarian Woman" (1899) describes an ordinary peasant woman risking her life to help Botev's guerrillas. "Grandpa Yotso Watches" (1901) describes the joy of a blind old man when he "saw" the freedom of his motherland. These are his famous short stories.
    During the two Balkan Wars of 1912-1913 and World War I, Vazov was unable to quickly see the differences in the nature and purpose of these wars, and therefore, nationalist tendencies were expressed in his works during this period.
    In addition to poems and novels, Vazov also wrote many plays, such as "Towards the Abyss" and "Borislav" (both in 1901). Although plays do not occupy an important position in Vazov's rich literary legacy, they have also left an indelible mark in the history of Bulgarian drama.
    Vazov is not unfamiliar to the Chinese people. The Chinese people will always feel honored and proud that it was our great thinker and revolutionary writer Lu Xun who first introduced Vazov to Chinese readers as early as 1921. Vazov's works are particularly亲切 to the Chinese people, because they have also suffered from the oppression and enslavement of foreign imperialism and have undergone a long period of armed struggle. Vazov's works have confirmed to the Chinese people that the fate of all oppressed and enslaved people is similar, and their hearts are connected. Vazov's works have also educated the Chinese people: the victory won by the people has been paid for at a great price, and the sacred responsibility of defending victory should be borne on the shoulders of those who die later.

    伟大的保加利亚作家伊万·瓦佐夫
    ——纪念伊万·瓦佐夫逝世三十五周年
    杨铁婴
    今年9月22日是伟大的保加利亚作家伊万·瓦佐夫逝世三十五周年纪念日。瓦佐夫是保加利亚民族文学的功绩卓著的建设者，是保加利亚人民的光荣和骄傲。他从开始自觉地以文学为武器而进行战斗的最初时刻起，便使自己的创作服务于民族解放运动的总任务。瓦佐夫在他光辉的一生中所遇到的保加利亚历史上的重大事件，几乎没有一件不反映在他的作品中。瓦佐夫的浩瀚的创作，不仅对保加利亚文学的发展具有巨大影响，而且至今依然在激励着、教育着保加利亚人民。他的作品，大大丰富了保加利亚语。保加利亚科学院院士罗曼斯基教授说：“伊万·瓦佐夫的词汇，无论在数量上，或是在涵义上都是最丰富的；总计有四万五千个不同的词。他十分成功地利用了它们的许许多多微妙的差别。”
    尽管由于当时的社会条件十分错综复杂，致使瓦佐夫未能理解诞生于十九世纪末叶的保加利亚工人阶级的历史使命，甚至在晚年的某些作品中流露了不健康的政治观点；但是，这毕竟不能影响他在保加利亚文学史上应分占有的中心地位。保加利亚人民政府和保加利亚共产党对瓦佐夫给予极高的评价，十分珍视他的文学遗产。
    瓦佐夫1850年7月9日诞生于斯塔拉·普拉尼那山南麓的小镇索波特。父亲是经营毛皮和烟草的商人，母亲十分温淑，是全镇中识字最多的女人。瓦佐夫七岁的时候，被送进本镇的小学校去读书。一位在俄国受过教育的老师教他学会了俄文。他在小学毕业以后，父亲把他送到卡洛费尔城。在这座因为生了伟大的诗人和革命者赫利斯多·保泰夫而有名的小城市中的生活，在瓦佐夫光辉的一生中是有决定意义的。他在卡洛费尔给一位小学校长当助手，教孩子们识字。学校里有一个很大的图书馆，藏有很多俄文书。瓦佐夫在这里贪婪地读了普希金、莱蒙托夫、果戈理、别林斯基和戈利果洛维奇的著作。瓦佐夫曾经说过：“这个图书馆对于我的成长起了重大的作用，假如没有它，我就会一事无成。……我之产生了新的口味，是由于俄国文学。”
    在保加利亚文学中，给少年瓦佐夫的心灵以深刻影响的，是瓦西里·德鲁迈夫、格奥尔基·拉柯夫斯基、彼得科·斯拉维伊柯夫等优秀的诗人和作家的爱国主义的诗歌和小说。后来，瓦佐夫在普罗夫迪夫中学学会了法文，读了雨果、贝朗热、拉玛尔丁和莫理哀的著作。1868年中学毕业以后，瓦佐夫被父亲叫回故乡，在父亲的店里帮助干活。但是，这位未来的作家和诗人，显然缺少商人的气质和经商的才干，两年多的时光，他并没有学得做生意的本领，却写了许多诗。这就是他的最初的诗集“五月的花”（1868——1870）。不过，这本诗集还不是他作为民族诗人的历史的开端。因为这一时期，他的不羁的才华还没有找到自己的道路，人民革命斗争的浪潮也还没有冲击到他的身边。而初恋的激情却使得这本诗集带有感伤情调。
    1870年春，瓦佐夫被送到住在罗马尼亚的叔父那里。叔父是父亲的商店的代理人。瓦佐夫的父亲希望他把伊万教育成自己的好助手和接班人。但是这个希望又落空了。不过在罗马尼亚生活的两年，对瓦佐夫来说，却是他光辉的一生中一个重要转捩点。当时，保加利亚的很多革命流亡者都聚集在罗马尼亚的布加勒斯特、加拉兹和布莱兹。瓦佐夫往返于这几个城市之间，认识了很多保加利亚的革命者，值得特别提出的，是他和杰出的革命领袖瓦西里·列夫斯基，和伟大的革命家、天才诗人赫利斯多·保泰夫的相识。这一切对瓦佐夫的政治思想和美学思想的成长是有着无可置疑的重大影响的。
    在罗马尼亚，瓦佐夫在保加利亚革命流亡者创办的报刊上发表了许多诗。他那首著名的“松树”（后来收在诗集“旗与琴”中）就是这个时期写的。他在诗中借着对一棵被暴风刮倒的老松树的哀伤，抒发自己对祖国的无限关怀和深厚的爱。这首诗使他赢得了很大的声望。而瓦佐夫也认为这首诗才是自己的文学生命的真正开端。
    1872年，瓦佐夫返回祖国，在斯维连格勒的一个小学校里当了一个时期的教员。他在青年中间积极地传播爱国思想，进行着武装起义的准备工作。不久，土耳其警察发觉了这位危险的教师，开始对他的行动进行调查和监视。瓦佐夫被迫离开斯维连格勒，回到故乡索波特。不久，又跑到贝尔尼克（即现在的季米特洛夫城），在铁路上当法语翻译员。
    在保加利亚人民革命史上，1873年是一个沉痛的年份。这一年的2月7日，残暴的土耳其压迫者绞死了保加利亚人民的优秀的儿子瓦西里·列夫斯基。血腥的镇压并没有挫折了人民群众的革命意志。相反，这个沉重的损失更加坚定了人民群众争取民族解放的决心。
    1874年秋，瓦佐夫回到索波特。革命的浪潮也冲击了这个小镇的居民：秘密地进行着起义的准备。瓦佐夫全身心地投入了起义的准备工作。这一时期，他写了很多反映人民的情绪、意志和愿望的爱国诗篇（其中大部分也都收进了诗集“旗与琴”之中）。瓦佐夫积极地参加由瓦西里·列夫斯基的战友托多尔·卡布列什柯夫所领导的秘密革命委员会的工作。他用热情的诗歌去激励人民的敌忾心，鼓舞人民踊跃地献身于民族解放的斗争。由于土耳其压迫者的迫害，他于1875年又逃往罗马尼亚。
    瓦佐夫逃到罗马尼亚以后，于1876年在布加勒斯特出版了诗集“旗与琴”。在这个诗集里，诗人描述着保加利亚人民在封建的土耳其统治压迫下的悲惨生活，号召人民用坚决的斗争去赢得宝贵的自由，歌颂保加利亚人民为摆脱被奴役的命运而奋勇战斗的英雄气概（“巴纳葛优尔的起义者”“志愿军”“复仇者”“不自由毋宁死”等），惋叹人民起义的失败。诗人并且宣誓，当他的人民依然呻吟、哭泣在外国侵略者的铁蹄之下的时候，他将只为正义和自由而歌唱。1876年保加利亚历史上著名的四月起义的挫败，给了瓦佐夫以极大的震动。对苦难的人民的哀伤、对封建土耳其压迫者的仇恨，对祖国的美好将来的信念，这一切凝成了许多动人的诗篇。这些诗，于1877年结集出版，名为“保加利亚的悲哀”。在这个集子里，瓦佐夫还愤怒地揭露了欧洲资产阶级政府的帮凶政策和败坏的道德（“政治”“致欧洲”等）。1877年春，俄国对土耳其宣战，并于1878年打败了土耳其，解放了保加利亚。保加利亚人民对帮助他们摆脱了土耳其封建帝国五百年压迫的俄罗斯人民的热爱和感激，充分地反映在瓦佐夫1878年出版的诗集“拯救”中。“旗与琴”“保加利亚的悲哀”和“拯救”这三个带有连续性的诗集，可以说是保加利亚人民在土耳其统治末期及其被推翻的年代中的生活、斗争、情感和愿望的写照。
    1879年，瓦佐夫在保加利亚公国西北部的贝尔柯维察城任地方法院院长。在这里，他写了一篇优美迷人的故事诗“石丘”。他以贫苦青年卡缅和富农女儿采纳恋爱的故事为线索，不仅歌颂了人民对土耳其压迫者的深切仇恨，还描述了农村中贫苦的人们对地主豪绅的斗争。1880年，瓦佐夫转赴普罗夫迪夫任东鲁米利亚自治区代表会议的代表。在普罗夫迪夫，瓦佐夫和其他几个人发起组织了名叫“科学”的文学团体，并出版了同名的杂志。这是保加利亚现代文学发展史中的重大事件之一。瓦佐夫被推选为“科学”杂志的主编。他的很多著名作品都曾经首先在“科学”上刊出，如中篇小说“米特洛芬和陶尔米道尔斯基”（1881年，当时题作“米特洛芬”）和“流亡者”（1883年）等。前者是针砭时弊的讽刺小说，讽刺在保加利亚获得自由以后的资产阶级政权的贪婪、昏庸和无能。后者，则是描写土耳其统治末期保加利亚政治流亡者在罗马尼亚的真实生活。
    组诗“被忘却者的史诗”（收在1881年的诗集“琴”中）在保加利亚现代文学史上占有重要的地位。瓦佐夫在诗中歌颂了那些为民族解放献出了生命的有名的和无名的英雄们，谴责了在取得政权后就肥私利己、剥削群众的资产阶级分子。
    1885年初，由于政府停止资助，“科学”杂志被迫停刊了。但是，瓦佐夫很快地就在同年三月又创办了“曙光”杂志，继续为建设保加利亚的批判现实主义文学而努力。
    1885年秋，东鲁米利亚自治区和保加利亚公国统一了。但是就在这个时候，塞尔维亚国王米兰却对曾经和塞尔维亚并肩抗击共同敌人——土耳其封建帝国的保加利亚，发动了侵略战争。在索非亚附近的斯利夫尼查村发生了激战。瓦佐夫访问了这个战场，并发表了著名的史诗“斯利夫尼查”。这一时期，他又写了不少动人心魄的短篇小说。例如“战争中的威尔珂”“他来了吗？”等等。交织在瓦佐夫这一时期的作品中的基本思想和情感，是热烈的爱国主义思想和崇高的人道主义思想。瓦佐夫在诗和小说中，在歌颂奋起保卫祖国的保加利亚人民的英勇的同时，也怀着深切的忧郁指出这次战争的自相残杀性质，而对塞尔维亚人民表现了崇高的人道主义。
    1886年秋，在外国帝国主义的策动下，保加利亚国内发生了武装政变。随着斯坦布洛夫资产阶级独裁政权的建立，保加利亚境内开始了对一切主张民主和赞成与俄罗斯友好的人们的疯狂迫害。瓦佐夫被迫于1887年逃到俄国，住了将近两年。瓦佐夫在这里感到了“失去祖国的悲哀和痛苦”，这样，“四月起义时代祖国的蓬勃生活”又在他的记忆中复活起来了。于是产生了“轭下”。这部举世闻名的长篇小说的重大意义，不仅因为它是保加利亚文学中空前的杰作，也不仅因为它使保加利亚文学赢得了国际地位，它的重大意义还在于作者深刻地教育了保加利亚人民：只有各方面都组织得好的武装斗争才能保证胜利，并且，它为保加利亚作家们树立了忠于生活的典范。
    短篇小说在瓦佐夫的文学遗产中占有极重要的地位。他在1889年回国后写了许多短篇小说。“‘茶花女’”（1895年）是一篇对斯坦布洛夫独裁政府的愤怒的抗议。“一个保加利亚女人”（1899年）描写一个普通的农妇冒着生命的危险，帮助保泰夫游击队员的故事。“约佐爷爷望着”（1901年）描写一个瞎眼的老头儿“看到了”祖国自由时的喜悦。这些都是他的有名的短篇小说。
    在1912年——1913年的两次巴尔干战争和第一次世界大战期间，瓦佐夫没有能够很快地看出这几次战争的性质和目的的区别，因此，在这一时期的作品中，表现了民族主义的倾向。
    瓦佐夫除了诗和小说以外，还写了不少剧本，如“走向深渊”和“鲍里斯拉夫”（均1901年）等。虽然在瓦佐夫的丰富的文学遗产中，剧本并不占有重要地位，但是，它们却也在保加利亚戏剧发展史上留下了不可磨灭的印迹。
    对于中国人民说来，瓦佐夫并不是陌生的。中国人民永远感到光荣和骄傲的，是早在1921年第一个把瓦佐夫介绍给中国读者的，乃是我们伟大的思想家和革命作家鲁迅。瓦佐夫的作品特别使中国人民感到亲切，因为他们也曾经遭受过外国帝国主义的压迫和奴役，进行过长期的武装斗争。瓦佐夫的作品为中国人民证实了：一切被压迫、被奴役的人民的命运是相似的，他们的心是相连的。瓦佐夫的作品也教育了中国人民：人民所赢得的胜利是付出了巨大的代价的，而保卫胜利的神圣责任应该担在后死者的肩上。
