What to Do When Building Machinery Spare Parts Are Insufficient
    Feng Shiming

    The Seriousness of the Spare Parts Problem

    In recent years, key construction departments have received large quantities of building machinery equipment from the state every year. Apart from some light machinery manufactured domestically, most of the heavy-duty construction machinery is imported. These imported machines are characterized by many models, high efficiency, complex specifications, and very high precision of parts. Looking at the nearly five hundred heavy-duty construction machines currently owned by the Anshan Metallurgical Construction Corporation, they are divided into fifty-eight types, and more than 98% of the machines are imported from seven countries.

    These high-efficiency machines play a significant role in accelerating China's socialist industrial construction. However, precisely because these machines come from abroad, cannot yet be produced in large quantities domestically, and lack corresponding spare parts manufacturing plants, the supply of spare parts for building machinery faces serious difficulties. In the first half of this year, four out of eleven large bulldozers of the Anshan Metallurgical Construction Corporation were out of service for a long time due to a lack of spare parts, one of which had been out of service for eight months. Last year, a Soviet-made single-bucket excavator was out of service for half a year due to the lack of a high-pressure oil pump. As a result, this excavator only worked for three months throughout the year, completing only 60% of the annual production quota. The phenomenon of "long construction periods and low quality" in repair work is one of the reasons for the low utilization rate of machinery, but the important reason for the "long construction periods and low quality" is precisely the insufficient supply of spare parts. Often, as soon as a machine enters the factory and is disassembled, it starts waiting for spare parts, and it is only repaired when they are purchased. A Czechoslovakian-made single-bucket excavator that entered the factory for repairs in April of this year has not yet left the factory due to waiting for cylinder heads, piston rings, and high-pressure oil pumps, exceeding the state-stipulated construction period by ninety days, equivalent to digging 40,000 cubic meters less of earthwork.

    From the current point of view, there are three ways to solve the spare parts supply problem. One is ordering from abroad, one is ordering domestically, and the other is manufacturing by the building machinery management department itself. The Anshan Metallurgical Construction Corporation has tried every means in these three aspects to solve this problem. In the first half of the year, their purchasing agents traveled to twenty-eight cities, from Shanghai in the east to Lanzhou in the west, from Fularji in the north to Wuhan in the south. However, the situation is still not very good. In terms of ordering from abroad, six hundred and eleven spare parts orders were placed as early as June 1955, but so far, only one hundred and fifteen types have been ordered, and there are still nearly five hundred types of spare parts that are not known when they will arrive. From the perspective of domestic ordering, the situation is also unsatisfactory. At the beginning of the year, it was planned to order six hundred and ninety-four types, but only two hundred and forty types were ordered, and only fifty-six types have arrived so far.

    Boldly Trial-Produce, Rely on Our Own Efforts

    So, where is the way out to solve the spare parts problem? Some people say, "The machinery comes from abroad, and it is not produced domestically, so it can only be solved by waiting for foreign spare parts orders to arrive." Of course, under the current circumstances, relying on foreign orders is one way to solve the source of spare parts. In the future, when the state purchases machinery from abroad, it should bring some spare parts with it; it is also necessary to order a certain number of spare parts from abroad every year that cannot be manufactured domestically. However, simply relying on foreign orders is not feasible. Because, first, the state must spend a considerable amount of foreign exchange to purchase some spare parts from abroad; second, foreign orders generally take a very long time (at least one to two years), which cannot meet the time requirements; third, the original foreign machinery manufacturers cannot supply all the spare parts for all exported machinery.

    The only reliable method is to rely on our own efforts and fully utilize the potential of our own domestic machinery industry. In the first half of this year, the building machinery repair factory of the Anshan Metallurgical Construction Corporation has trial-produced fifteen types of heavy-duty machinery spare parts, including more precise parts such as excavator, tractor, and tank crane four-row chains, high-pressure oil pumps, pistons, and piston rings. Now, the Anshan Metallurgical Construction Corporation has established a special spare parts production workshop. In addition to preparing to continue trial-producing thirty-seven new spare parts in the second half of the year, batch production of building machinery parts that have been successfully trial-produced and can be self-made has already begun.

    Fully Utilize Domestic Potential, Establish Spare Parts Manufacturing Plants

    However, relying solely on small-scale machinery processing plants like Anshan to manufacture them is impossible to solve all the problems. Due to limitations in equipment, technology, and other conditions, at most, only 30% of the spare parts sources can be solved; moreover, other construction enterprises may not have the same conditions as Anshan. Therefore, another way to solve the spare parts problem is to fully utilize the potential of the existing domestic machinery industry.

    Currently, many cities in China have a considerable number of small machinery processing plants. Although these factories are small in scale, some are only cooperative groups, but many have high levels of technical expertise. Many parts that cannot be processed in the Anshan machinery repair factory can be manufactured in these small processing plants with rudimentary equipment. Before the upsurge of socialist transformation on a national scale, there was a small machinery processing plant in Shenyang. In terms of equipment, it only had two broken machine tools, and in terms of workers, it only had a husband and wife. However, it could manufacture pistons and piston rings for building machinery. Now, the Anshan Metallurgical Construction Corporation has established contractual relationships with more than fifty machinery processing factories across the country to order building machinery parts from them. However, this kind of connection is still in a spontaneous state. These small processing plants serve many objects, including industry and agriculture, and whether or not an order can be placed often depends on the situation at the time. Now that these small machinery processing industries have all implemented joint state-private ownership, it is hoped that the State Planning Commission will organize the production of these medium and small-sized machinery processing plants through planned orders, so that they can better produce spare parts for building machinery.

    In addition, in order to fix the production of building machinery spare parts and facilitate the improvement of technology, it is also hoped that the State Construction Commission will quickly rebuild or build a batch of more regular spare parts manufacturing plants with more complete equipment in certain areas.

        The Revival of Parts

    Another practical and effective way to solve the building machinery spare parts problem is to repair building machinery parts. Many building machinery parts that have been worn out can be restored to their original strength and quality after repair and technical treatment. The most commonly used methods for restoration are welding, metal spraying, electroplating, etc. For example, worn mechanical bearings can be used as usual after spraying and processing. However, such an effective saving method has not attracted enough attention from building machinery management departments. Many parts that can be repaired and used are still treated as waste products. In May, June, and July of this year, the building machinery repair factory of the Anshan Metallurgical Construction Corporation has repaired more than six hundred and seventy building machinery parts, worth 36,000 yuan, which not only reduced repair costs, but more importantly, solved the current difficulty in spare parts supply. However, what the Anshan Metallurgical Construction Corporation is currently doing is only a small part of what should be done. 90% of the old parts that can be revived have not been repaired, some are treated as waste products, and some have become rusty iron due to lack of collection and management. Therefore, if all construction enterprises across the country universally attach importance to parts repair work, it goes without saying that it will greatly save investment and greatly help solve the current difficulties in spare parts supply.

        "Early" and "Sufficient"

    The experience of the Anshan Metallurgical Construction Corporation proves that to do a good job in spare parts supply, attention must be paid to two things: one is "early," and the other is "sufficient." "Early" means advance storage, and "sufficient" requires sufficient storage of spare parts. Anshan has suffered many losses on the issue of "early." For example, in the past, when ordering machinery from abroad, spare parts were not ordered; only when the machinery broke down were they purchased, causing the machinery to be out of service for a long time. Obviously, this "grasp at the last minute" approach is not good. Under the current circumstances of extremely difficult spare parts supply, it is even more important to achieve advance storage. Therefore, a storage quota should be formulated based on the actual wear of the parts and the expected maintenance needs, and they should be prepared in advance, so that when a machine part breaks down, it can be replaced immediately. This will ensure that the machine works normally during construction.

    Closely related to "early" is "sufficient," which means that sufficient storage of spare parts must be achieved, and the meaning of "spare parts backlog" should be correctly understood. The so-called "spare parts" are parts that are prepared for use and cannot be equated with general consumables. Some people say: "No matter what, it is not right to store a large number of spare parts that are not currently in use." This statement is one-sided. We would rather let a part be "backlogged" in the warehouse for a year than let an excavator be out of service for three months due to the lack of a part. Of course, when determining the spare parts storage amount, we should try our best to consider accelerating capital turnover. As far as the current situation is concerned, it is generally not too much storage, but too little.

    Strengthen Daily Maintenance

    It must be pointed out that in order to improve the machinery utilization coefficient, overcome the phenomenon of "long construction periods and low quality" in repair work, and ensure the normal operation of machinery, it is not right to rely solely on spare parts supply work. What is more important is to strengthen the daily maintenance and correct operation of building machinery, reduce the wear of parts, and reduce machinery accidents. However, many building machinery managers have overlooked this point. They often attribute the low utilization rate of machinery to the backward spare parts supply (of course, this is also an important reason), but they have not seen that the current tight spare parts supply is closely related to the large number of machinery accidents and large-scale damage. You must know that if the daily maintenance work of the machinery is not done well and accidents occur frequently, even if enough spare parts are stored, it will still not be possible to supply them. Currently, the Anshan Metallurgical Construction Corporation still has serious shortcomings in this regard. According to statistics from the local mechanization company under its jurisdiction from January to July this year, there were one hundred and fourteen machinery accidents. According to regulations, a single-bucket excavator should be used for 11,520 hours for each major repair, but it can only be used for 3,544 hours in actual use before it can no longer continue to work.

    建筑机械备件不足怎么办
    冯世明
    备件问题的严重性
    近几年来，各重点建设部门每年都从国家手里获得大批建筑机械装备。这些建筑机械除了一部分轻型的由国内制造外，大部分重型建筑机械都是进口的。这些进口机械的特点是型号多、效率高、规格复杂，零件精密度很高。从鞍山冶金建筑总公司现有的近五百台重型建筑机械来看，按种类分就有五十八种，占98％以上的机械是从七个国家进口的。
    这些高效率的机械，一方面在加速我国社会主义工业建设上起着重大作用；但在另一方面，正由于这些机械来自国外，在国内还不能大批生产，又没有相应的备件制造厂，也给建筑机械备件供应工作带来严重的困难。今年上半年，鞍山冶金建筑总公司十一台大型推土机，有四台由于缺备件而长期停工，其中一台已停工八个月。去年有一台苏联出品的单斗挖土机，因缺一个高压油泵，就停工半年，结果这台挖土机全年只工作了三个月，只完成年产定额的60％。修理工作中“工期长、质量低”的现象是机械利用率低的原因之一，但造成“工期长、质量低”的重要原因，正是备件供应不足。往往机械进厂一拆开，就开始待备件，什么时候买到，什么时候修复。今年4月进厂修理的一台捷克斯洛伐克出品的单斗挖土机，由于等汽顶、涨圈、高压油泵，直到现在尚未出厂，已超过国家规定工期九十天，相当于少挖四万立方公尺的土方。
    解决备件供应来源，从目前看来，有三种办法。一个是国外订货，一个是国内订购，另一个是建筑机械管理部门自己制造。鞍山冶金建筑总公司，为了解决这个问题，曾经在这三方面想尽了很多办法，上半年他们的采购员跑遍了二十八个城市，东到上海、西到兰州、北到富拉尔基、南到武汉，都有采购员的足迹。但是情况仍然很不好。国外订货方面，早在1955年6月就提出去了六百一十一项备件订货，但直到现在为止，只订到一百一十五种，还有近五百种备件不知何年何月才能到货。从国内订货情况来看，也是不能令人满意的。年初计划订货有六百九十四种，订到货的只有二百四十种，而现在已经到货的才仅有五十六种。
    大胆试制，自力更生
    那么，解决备件问题的出路何在呢？有人说“机械是国外来的，国内又不生产，只有等国外备件订货到来才能解决”。当然，在目前情况下，依靠国外订货是解决备件来源的一个方法，今后国家在国外订购机械时，应该随带一部分备件；也有必要每年在国外订购一定数量的在国内实在不能制造的备件。但是，单纯依靠国外订货却是行不通的。因为，第一、国家为了购进国外一部分备件，就必须用去一笔不小的外汇；第二、国外订货一般的时间都拖得很长（至少一年到二年），不能满足时间上的要求；第三、国外的原机械制造厂，也不可能全部供应所有出口机械的备件。
    唯一可靠的办法是自力更生，充分利用国内自己的机械工业的潜力。今年上半年鞍山冶金建筑总公司的建筑机械修理厂，已经试制成十五种重型机械备件，其中有挖土机、拖拉机、坦克吊车的四排链子、高压油泵、活塞、涨圈等较为精密的零件。现在，鞍山冶金建筑总公司已成立了专门的备件制作车间，除了准备在下半年继续再试制三十七项新备件外，已经试制成功和可以自制的建筑机械零件，已经开始成批生产。
    充分运用国内潜力，建立备件制造厂
    但是，仅仅依靠像鞍山这样规模不大的小机械加工厂自制，是不可能解决全部问题的，由于设备、技术等条件的限制，最多只能解决备件来源的30％；而且，其他建筑企业也不一定都有鞍山这样的条件。因此，解决备件问题的另一方法，是充分地运用国内现有机械工业的潜力。
    目前国内许多城市里，都有为数不小的小型机械加工厂。这些工厂规模虽然很小，有的仅仅是一种合作小组性质，但却有许多是技术水平很高的。许多在鞍山机械修理厂不能加工的零件，在这些设备简陋的小型加工场，却能制造。在全国规模的社会主义改造高潮到来以前，沈阳有一个小机械加工场，论设备只有两部破机床，论工人只有夫妇两个，但却能制造建筑机械的活塞和涨圈。现在鞍山冶金建筑总公司已经和全国五十多个机械加工工厂建立合同关系，向他们订配建筑机械零件。但这种联系还处于自发状态中。这些小加工场服务对象很多，有工业，也有农业，能否订到货往往取决于当时的情况。现在，这些小型机械加工工业都实行了公私合营，希望国家计划委员会通过计划订货把这些中、小型机械加工厂的生产组织起来，使它们更好地为建筑机械生产备件。
    另外，为了固定建筑机械备件生产，便于提高技术，也希望国家建设委员会迅速在一定地区改建或新建一批较为正规、设备较为健全的备件制造厂。
        零件的复活
    解决建筑机械备件问题另一个切实有效的办法，是修复建筑机械零件。许多建筑机械已经磨损了的零件，经过修理和技术处理，都可以恢复到原来的强度和质量。恢复的方法，最常用的有焊补、金属喷镀、电镀等。如磨损了的机械轴承，经过喷镀和加工以后，就可以照常使用。但是，这样一个有效的节约方法，还没有引起建筑机械管理部门足够的重视，许多可以修理后使用的零件，还被当作废品处理。鞍山冶金建筑总公司的建筑机械修理厂今年五、六、七三个月中，已经修复了建筑机械零件六百七十多件，价值三万六千元，不仅降低了修理成本，更重要的是解决了当前备件供应上的困难。但鞍山冶金建筑总公司目前作的，还只是应该作的一小部分而已，占90％的可以复活的旧零件尚未修复，有的当作废品处理了，有的由于无人收集管理已成锈铁。因此，假若全国各建筑企业普遍重视零件修复工作，不用说，将会大大地节省投资，大大有利于解决当前备件供应上的困难。
        “早”和“足”
    鞍山冶金建筑总公司的经验证明，要想作好备件供应工作，必须注意两件事：一是“早”，另一件是“足”。“早”就是事先储备的意思，“足”是要求作到备件的充分储备。在“早”的问题上，鞍山曾经吃过许多亏，比如过去往国外订机械都不订备件；待机械一坏，才去订购，造成机械长期停工。显然，这种“临时抱佛脚”的办法是不好的。在目前备件供应十分困难的情况下，作到事先储备更具有十分重要的意义。因此，应该根据零件磨损的实际情况和预期检修需要，制订储备定额，事先就准备好，等机械零件一坏，立即换上。这样就能保证机械在施工过程中正常工作。
    和“早”有密切联系的是“足”，这就是说，要作到备件充分储备，并应正确理解“备件积压”的含义。所谓“备件”就是准备用的零件，同一般消耗材料是不能等量同观的。有人说：“不管怎样，大量储备现在不用的备件是不对的”。这种说法是片面的。我们宁肯让一个零件在库内“积压”一年，不能让一台挖土机由于缺一个零件而停工三个月。当然，在核定备件储备量时，应当尽量考虑到加速资金周转。至于从当前情况来看，一般还不是储备太多，而是太少。
    加强日常的维护工作
    必须指出，要想提高机械利用系数，克服修理工作中“工期长、质量低”的现象，保证机械正常工作，单纯地依赖备件供应工作是不对的。更重要的是加强建筑机械的日常维护和正确的操作，减少零件的磨损和机械事故。但是，许多建筑机械管理人员却忽视了这一点，他们往往把机械利用率低的原因，归结于备件供应落后（当然，这也是一个重要原因），而没有看到目前备件供应紧张同机械事故多和大批损坏有密切关系。要知道，假若机械日常维护工作作得不好，事故频繁，即使储备了足够的备件还是不可能供上的。现在鞍山冶金建筑总公司，恰恰在这方面还存在严重缺点，据所属的地方机械化公司今年1至7月的统计，发生的机械事故就有一百一十四件。单斗挖土机每进行一次大修，按规定应使用一万一千五百二十台时，但实际使用只有三千五百四十四台时，就不能继续工作了。
