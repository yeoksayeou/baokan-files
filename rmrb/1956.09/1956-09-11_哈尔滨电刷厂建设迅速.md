Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, September 10th: (Xinhua News Agency reporter Tao Suqi reports:) The prototype of another newly built modern factory is standing tall in Harbin. This is the Harbin Electric Brush Factory, which manufactures carbon products such as electric brushes, vacuum tube telegrams, and arc light rods. Since construction started in March this year, the main factory building, auxiliary factory buildings, dormitories, warehouses, and other buildings have been completed or are nearing completion. The woodworking workshop, boiler room, pump room, substation, and other projects began equipment installation in August. The woodworking workshop, pump room, and other projects, originally scheduled to go into production in January next year, will now go into production in September this year. The machine repair and tool workshops, originally scheduled to go into production in March next year, will also go into production in January next year.

This new factory is now stepping up its production preparation work; the newly established technical school is actively training skilled workers; and some of the jigs and fixtures for production have been entrusted to other factories for manufacturing. Dozens of engineering and technical personnel are currently compiling process regulations and production technical data.

    哈尔滨电刷厂建设迅速
    新华社哈尔滨10日电　新华社记者陶肃奇报道：又一座新建现代化工厂的雏形在哈尔滨市矗立起来了。这座制造电刷、真空管电报、弧光棒等炭素制品的哈尔滨电刷厂。从今年3月开工以来，主厂房、辅助厂房、宿舍、仓库等建筑物，都已经完工或接近完工了；木工车间、锅炉房、水泵房、变电所等工程，都在8月份开始了设备安装。原订在明年一月投入生产的木工车间、水泵房等工程，都将提前在今年9月份投入生产；原计划在明年3月投入生产的机修、工具车间，也将提前在明年1月投入生产。
    这个新工厂，现在在加紧进行生产准备工作；新成立的技工学校，正在积极培训技术工人；生产用的部分工卡具，已经委托别的厂制造了。数十个工程技术人员，现正编制工艺规程和生产技术资料。
