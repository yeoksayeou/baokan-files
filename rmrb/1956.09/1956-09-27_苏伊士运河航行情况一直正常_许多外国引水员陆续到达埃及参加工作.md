    Xinhua News Agency, September 26th dispatch from Cairo: Mahmoud Younis, the head of the Suez Canal Authority, told reporters from the Cairo "Al-Akhbar" on September 24th that the canal situation had returned to normal and that no pilots are currently overworked. He also said that the canal management authority continues to receive applications from sailors of many different nationalities requesting to work as Suez Canal pilots.

    According to Cairo newspapers, although the Suez Canal Authority is still lacking pilots and other professional personnel, no delays have occurred in piloting work during the entire navigation period of the canal.

    Foreign pilots who volunteered to participate in the work on the Suez Canal in response to the Egyptian government's recruitment efforts are arriving in Egypt one after another. Among them, seven from Yugoslavia and twelve from Poland arrived in Port Said on the 23rd. Of the fifteen Italian pilots who applied to the canal authority, two have already started working. In addition, two new pilots from West Germany and several from Greece have also started working.

    Fifteen Soviet pilots working on the Suez Canal are successfully completing their internships. They have already served as deputy pilots for several piloting assignments.

    苏伊士运河航行情况一直正常
    许多外国引水员陆续到达埃及参加工作
    据新华社26日讯　开罗消息：苏伊士运河管理局负责人马哈茂德·尤尼斯9月24日对开罗“消息报”的记者说，运河情况已经恢复正常，目前没有任何引水员是工作过度的。他还说，运河的管理当局继续收到许多不同国籍的海员们要求担任苏伊士运河引水员工作的申请书。
    据开罗报纸消息，尽管苏伊士运河管理委员会还很缺少引水员和其他专业人材，但是在运河整个通航期间，在领航工作中，还不曾发生过任何拖延的情况。
    应埃及政府招聘志愿参加苏伊士运河工作的外国引水员正陆续到达埃及，其中南斯拉夫七名和波兰十二名已在23日到达塞得港。向运河当局申请的十五名意大利引水员中已有两名参加工作。另外，西德两名和希腊若干名新的引水员也参加了工作。
    在苏伊士运河工作的十五名苏联引水员正在成功地进行实习。他们都已经作为副引水员担任了几次领航引导工作。
