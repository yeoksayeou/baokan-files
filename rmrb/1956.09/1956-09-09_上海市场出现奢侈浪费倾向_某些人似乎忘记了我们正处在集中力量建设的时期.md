Xinhua News Agency Report by Xinhua News Agency reporters Zhang Jiachi and Ye Shitao: This year's consumer market in Shanghai is unprecedentedly prosperous. The enormous growth in industrial production has given workers a large increase in income. Recently, state organs implemented wage reforms, cadres received back pay, jointly-owned public-private enterprises distributed back wages to employees, and private shareholders received dividends amounting to more than 25 million yuan. Factories and mines across the country are sending streams of purchasing agents to Shanghai to procure various materials. This enormous purchasing power makes the shops here crowded, the hotels full every night, and the entertainment venues swarming with visitors. However, behind this prosperous scene, some undesirable tendencies of luxury and waste are beginning to emerge.

In the past month or so, many of the city's famous high-end restaurants and hotels have suddenly reversed the usual sluggish business of the summer, and banquets are being held every day. By five or six o'clock every evening, there are no seats left. Recently, due to typhoon impacts and the approaching off-season for non-staple food production, the supply of meat and vegetables in Shanghai's small markets is insufficient. Although commercial departments have dispatched personnel to travel as far as Northeast China and Inner Mongolia to purchase supplies with great effort, housewives still have to queue to buy them. However, in these restaurants and hotels, people are eating and drinking extravagantly. Restaurants and eateries, large and small, along Nanjing Road and Fuzhou Road, throw away more than 2,000 kilograms of leftover food every day. There are still more than twenty days until National Day, but hotels and restaurants in this area have already booked more than 1,000 tables for holiday banquets.

The sales of various expensive and even luxurious goods have also suddenly increased recently. Jewelry stores have sold large quantities of jewelry and diamonds, and even diamond rings costing nearly 8,000 yuan have been purchased. Radio sets costing more than 1,300 yuan are out of stock. The supply of high-priced carpets, refrigerators, cameras, and high-quality furniture is also tight. Various government organs and factories and mines are ordering expensive furniture made of imported teak in Shanghai, and have bought sets of leather and velvet sofas costing hundreds of yuan.

These trends of luxury and waste will increase unnecessary burdens on the state and society. For example, the domestic consumption growth of certain consumer goods may force a reduction in exports, which will affect the import of construction equipment.

Judging from the current situation in Shanghai, it seems that some people have forgotten that we are in an era of concentrating all our efforts on building basic industries.

### 上海市场出现奢侈浪费倾向  某些人似乎忘记了我们正处在集中力量建设的时期

    上海市场出现奢侈浪费倾向
    某些人似乎忘记了我们正处在集中力量建设的时期
    据新华社讯　新华社记者张家炽、叶世涛报道：今年上海消费市场盛况空前。工业生产的巨大增长，使工人们增加了一笔很大的收入。最近国家机关实行工资改革，干部们拿到了补发的工资，公私合营企业发放了职工的欠薪，私方人员也拿到了为数达二千五百多万元的股息。全国各地工矿企业川流不息的派出成千的采购人员到上海采购各种物资。这些巨大的购买力使这里的商店门庭若市，旅馆夜夜客满，娱乐场所游客如云。但是在这种繁荣的景象后面，也开始透露出一些奢侈浪费的不好倾向。
    最近一个多月来，全市许多著名的高级饭店、酒楼，忽然一反夏季营业清淡的惯例，天天有人请客宴会。每天黄昏五、六点钟，已经席无虚坐。上海近来因为台风影响和面临副食品生产淡季，小菜场上荤素菜供应不足，商业部门虽然派出专人，不辞辛苦远至东北、内蒙古去采购，家庭主妇还要排队购买。可是，这些饭店、酒楼里却有人在大吃大喝，像南京路、福州路一带大小酒菜馆每天倒掉的剩饭剩菜就有二千多斤。现在离国庆节还有二十多天，这一带的饭店、酒楼已经定出节期的酒席一千多桌。
    各种高贵的、甚至奢侈性的商品，最近销路也突然增加起来。珠宝店卖出了大批珠宝钻石，甚至近八千元一颗的钻戒也有人购买。一千三百多元一架的收音机发生脱销。高价的地毯、电冰箱、照相机和上等家具供应也很紧张。各地机关和厂矿企业在上海订购进口柚木做的高贵家具，买去了几百元一套的皮沙发和丝绒沙发。
    这一些奢侈浪费的趋势，将会加重国家和社会不必要的负担。譬如有一些消费品，就可能因为国内消费增长的压力而不得不减少一些出口，因而也就要影响建设器材的进口。
    从目前上海反映的情况看，似乎某些人已经忘记了我们正处在一个集中一切力量建设基本工业的时代。
