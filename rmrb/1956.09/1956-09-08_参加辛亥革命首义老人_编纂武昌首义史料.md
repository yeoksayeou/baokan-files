Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 7th. A group of elderly participants of the Wuchang Uprising from the Xinhai Revolution in Wuhan are currently compiling "A Collection of Historical Materials on the Wuchang Uprising of the Xinhai Revolution," a book documenting the historical facts of the Wuchang Uprising.

The first and second collections of this compilation contain articles from twenty-eight elderly people, totaling more than 500,000 words. The elderly people have written articles about their personal experiences or the historical facts they witnessed at the time, introducing the actual situation before and after the uprising. Mr. Xiong Bingkun, who fired the first shot during the uprising, wrote an article entitled "Overview of the Outbreak of the 8th Battalion of the Engineering Corps during the Xinhai Revolution" for the first collection. Mr. Li Chunxuan, the Minister of Finance of the Hubei Military Government (the leading organ of the Xinhai Revolution) at the time, wrote an article entitled "A Complete Account of the Wuchang Uprising of the Xinhai Revolution," which is more than 100,000 words long and is included in the second collection. In the article, he described in detail the struggles of the Xinhai Revolution in four stages: preparation, launch, North-South peace talks, and anti-Yuan (Shikai).

As early as last autumn, the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference organized the elderly participants of the uprising to form a "Historical Materials Collection Group for the Xinhai Uprising," responsible for collecting historical materials from the elderly and preparing to compile them into a book. Now, the first and second collections of this compilation are about to be published by the Hubei People's Publishing House, and will soon be available to readers. The third collection is currently being collected and compiled.

    参加辛亥革命首义老人
    编纂武昌首义史料
    新华社武汉7日电　武昌市参加辛亥革命的一批首义老人，正在编纂一部记载武昌首义史实的“辛亥革命武昌首义资料汇编”。
    收集在这部资料汇编的第一、二集内的二十八位老人的文章，共约五十多万字。老人们分别把当时的亲身经历或耳闻目见的历史事实写成文章，介绍了首义前后的实际情况。在起义时放了第一枪的熊秉坤老先生为第一集写了一篇“辛亥革命工程第八营发难概况”的文章。当时湖北军政府（辛亥革命领导机关）的财政部长李春萱老先生写的“辛亥革命首义纪事的本末”一文约有十多万字，编在第二集内，他在文章里详尽地叙述了辛亥革命在酝酿、发动、南北议和及反袁（世凯）等四个阶段的斗争情况。
    早在去年秋季，政协湖北省委员会就组织首义老人成立了“征集辛亥首义史料小组”，负责向首义老人征集史料文稿，准备汇编成册，现在这部资料汇编的第一、二集即将交湖北人民出版社出版，不久就可以和读者见面。第三集正在征集、编纂中。
