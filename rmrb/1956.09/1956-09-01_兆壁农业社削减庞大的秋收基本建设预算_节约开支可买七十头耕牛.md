Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 29th -- After democratic discussions among its members, the Zhaobi Agricultural Cooperative in Liuhe County, Jiangsu Province, reduced its huge autumn harvest capital construction budget, saving expenses equivalent to the price of seventy oxen or one thousand piglets.

    The Zhaobi Agricultural Cooperative was established last winter. Due to water conservancy construction and changes in the farming system, this year the cooperative planted more than 5,500 mu of rice, more than double the amount planted by the nine smaller cooperatives operating separately last year. With the selection of improved varieties and increased fertilization, the cooperative's 10,000 mu of paddy and dry land are currently showing signs of a bumper harvest. Although more than 5,000 mu of wheat suffered from disasters and reduced production by 84% in the spring, a large-scale autumn harvest is expected, and it is estimated that the total annual grain output can still increase by about 30% compared with last year, that is, an increase of more than 600,000 jin.

    As the cooperative excitedly prepares for the autumn harvest, each production team has prepared a "large-scale" harvest capital construction budget. The cooperative plans to build new warehouses and buy new tools, requiring a total of 12,000 yuan. The cooperative management committee took the budget to the members for discussion, and most of the cooperative cadres and members disagreed with this approach. They actively put forward rationalization proposals to revise the budget. The original budget was to build eighty-four large warehouses at a cost of more than 6,700 yuan. The members proposed that there was no need to build any new warehouses, as they could harvest, thresh, dry, hand over public grain, and sell surplus grain simultaneously. For temporary use in case of rainy weather, cooperative members with more houses voluntarily offered twenty-four empty rooms to the cooperative, and experienced members designed and built fifteen simple and practical thatched houses, which would only cost 300 yuan, including labor. The original budget was to spend more than 2,000 yuan to buy 780 new grain bin discs. Now, in addition to stacking earthen walls and covering the grain with grass to replace some of the grain bin discs, cooperative members have taken out more than 600 old grain bin discs from their homes for the cooperative to repair and borrow, and it will be enough to buy 140 new grain bin discs for 400 yuan. Other utensils that were to be added in the original budget, such as hundreds of rice baskets and winnowing fans, have also been settled under the principle of spending less or no money.

    The revised autumn harvest capital construction budget requires less than 2,000 yuan, saving 10,000 yuan compared to the original budget. If this money were distributed to the cooperative members, the average household of the cooperative's 507 households could receive nearly 20 yuan more. If used for production, it could buy seventy oxen worth 150 yuan each, or one thousand piglets weighing 20 jin each.

### 兆壁农业社削减庞大的秋收基本建设预算  节约开支可买七十头耕牛

    兆壁农业社削减庞大的秋收基本建设预算
    节约开支可买七十头耕牛
    新华社南京29日电　经过社员们的民主讨论，江苏省六合县兆壁农业社削减了庞大的秋收基本建设预算，节约了相当于七十头耕牛或一千头小猪价款的开支。
    兆壁农业社是在去年冬季建立的。由于兴修水利和改变耕作制度，今年这个社栽种水稻五千五百多亩，比去年九个小社分散经营时增加一倍多。全社一万亩水、旱田，在选用良种、增加施肥量等情况下，目前呈现出一片丰收景象。虽然春季五千多亩小麦受灾减产84％，但是秋季大面积丰收在望，估计全年粮食产量仍可以比去年增加三成左右，即增加六十多万斤。
    全社在兴奋地准备秋收中，各生产队纷纷编制“大规模”收割的基本建设预算。全社准备盖新仓房，买新工具，共计需款一万二千元。社务管理委员会把预算拿到社员中间去讨论，大部分社干部和社员都不同意这样做。他们积极提出合理化建议，修改预算。原预算用六千七百多元建造八十四间大仓房，社员们提出收获时边收、边打、边晒、边交公粮和卖余粮，就用不到再盖什么新仓房。为防备雨天临时用途，房子多的社员自愿腾出二十四间空屋借给社里，再由有经验的社员设计盖十五间简单实用的草房，连人工在内只需三百元就行了。原预算花两千多元买七百八十盘新囤折，现在除了叠土墙和在粮食上盖草，代替一部分囤折以外，社员家里有六百多盘旧囤折都拿出来由社里修理借用，再用四百元买一百四十盘新囤折就够了。原预算中所要添置的其他用具，如成百的稻箩、簸箕等，也在少花或不花钱的原则下有了着落。
    修改后的秋收基本建设预算，用钱不到二千元，比原预算节省一万元。如果把这笔钱分给社员，全社五百零七户平均每户就可以多分近二十元。如果用来投入生产，就可以买每头值一百五十元的耕牛七十头，或是买二十斤重的小猪一千头。
