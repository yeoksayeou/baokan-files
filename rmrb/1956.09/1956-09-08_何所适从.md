    What to Do

    This year, the Jilin Railway Administration decided to build a cultural palace. At the beginning of construction, the capital construction department, in order to save cement, believed that using No. 10 mortar for the foundation masonry could save the state more than 40 tons of cement, according to the appendix of the Ministry of Railways Order No. 86 of 1954. However, the design unit, based on the book "Brick and Stone Structures for Civil and Industrial Buildings," insisted on using No. 25 mortar for the sake of project insurance. The two sides were deadlocked, so the capital construction department inquired with the Technology Division of the Design General Bureau of the Ministry of Railways on July 14. The reply was: using No. 10 mortar is perfectly adequate. The design office was not convinced and, a day later, also inquired with the Technology Division of the Design General Bureau. The Technology Division then replied that using No. 25 mortar would be more appropriate. Since both sides had replies from higher authorities as their basis, they each stuck to their own views, and the dispute went all the way to the Chief Engineer's Office. To solve this problem carefully, the Chief Engineer inquired with the Design General Bureau again, requesting a definite answer. Who knew that this time the Design General Bureau changed its tune and said, "You should inquire with the Engineering General Bureau!" The reply from the New Railway Construction Engineering General Bureau was: "The appendix in Order No. 86 was copied from the Soviet Union, and we have not researched it. You'd better ask the Design General Bureau!"

    The superior leading organs are irresponsible in answering questions and shirk responsibility to each other, which makes it difficult for comrades who do concrete work below. Who is right and who is wrong? It leaves people at a loss as to what to do!　Ning Jing

    何所适从
    吉林铁路管理局今年决定修建一座文化宫。开工之初，基本建设部门为了节约水泥，根据铁道部1954年第八十六号部令的附件规定，认为砌筑基础的混合砂浆如果采用十号砂浆，可以为国家节约四十多吨水泥。然而设计单位根据“民用与工业房屋砖石结构”一书的规定，为了使工程保险起见，坚持采用二十五号砂浆。双方相持不下，基本建设部门就在7月14日向铁道部设计总局技术处询问，答复是：采用十号砂浆就满可以了；设计事务所不服气，隔了一天也向设计总局技术处询问，技术处却又答复说，采用二十五号砂浆较为合适。双方既然都有上级的答复作根据，更是各执己见，官司一直打到总工程师室。总工程师为了慎重解决这个问题，又再次向设计总局询问，要求有个肯定的答复。那知道这一回设计总局又换了口气说：“你们向工程总局打听一下吧！”新建铁路工程总局的答复却是：“八十六号部令中的附件是从苏联抄来的，我们也没有什么研究，你们最好还是问问设计总局吧！”
    上级领导机关答复问题不负责任，而且互相推诿，这就苦了下面做具体工作的同志。究竟谁是谁非，叫人何所适从啊？　宁静
