Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, September 15th. The full text of the statement made by Indian Prime Minister Nehru in the People's House on September 13th regarding the Suez Canal issue is as follows:

    I would like to say a few words about the recent developments in the Suez Canal issue. Originally, I intended to make a statement in a day or two when we had more complete information. At present, we have seen newspaper reports about the speech made by British Prime Minister Eden in the British House of Commons yesterday.

    However, since Parliament will adjourn tonight and I will not have the opportunity to make any statement for some time, I will speak now.

    The People's House knows that we have made serious efforts to promote a negotiated solution to the Suez Canal issue. We saw very clearly that any other approach to this problem, or any attempt to impose a decision, would not only fail to achieve the desired results, but could also lead to much more serious consequences, the severity of which could not be foreseen. At the London conference, we did everything in our power to urge steps to achieve negotiations and put forward some general suggestions. Ceylon, Indonesia, and the Soviet Union supported these suggestions. However, the majority of countries attending the meeting adopted a different approach, as is well known.

    From the newspaper reports about Sir Anthony Eden's speech yesterday, it is impossible to fully estimate the meaning and implications of the actions reportedly being considered by the governments of the United Kingdom, France, and the United States. We cannot estimate this until we receive more detailed reports through official sources.

    The actions that the three governments intend to take, allegedly for the benefit of the canal users and to maintain the freedom of use of the canal, are, to say the least, surprising, and the consequences that may arise from this are likely to be very serious. One thing is clear: the intended action is not the result of agreement, cooperation, and consent, but is to be taken unilaterally, and therefore has the nature of being imposed and decided.

    The Indian government deeply regrets this development, which is very unusual and will make a peaceful solution more difficult to achieve. It is not designed to enable user countries to use the canal peacefully and safely, which should be, and indeed is, what user countries and the international community demand.

    The Menzies delegation, which recently visited Cairo, had requested the Egyptian government to accept international control over the operation and management of the canal and to establish an international company to replace the Egyptian national company. Egypt refused to accept these proposals because they violated its sovereignty and were irrelevant to the purposes of the 1888 Convention and the interests of the user countries, namely: freedom of passage through the canal, tolls, and maintenance, etc., which only the Egyptian government can guarantee.

    The Egyptian government's response has opened the way for negotiations. The Indian government believes that such negotiations could have led to a solution that would meet all the needs of user countries and the international community without harming or depriving Egypt of its sovereignty and its national rights over the canal, which is recognized as an integral part of Egypt.

    I have already notified the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and the President of the United States in the past few days that the situation that emerged after the end of the Menzies delegation's mission and the Egyptian government's statement accepting all international obligations and demanding negotiations opened the way to a solution. We urged the United Kingdom and the United States to consider all this and allow negotiations that would lead to a solution to develop. We hope that, despite everything that has happened and has caused tension, everyone will take the path of peace. There is no question of condoning one side or the other here, because what is being sought, and what we believe can be achieved, is a solution that is satisfactory and honorable to all parties concerned.

    The Indian government sincerely hopes that our appeal will not fall on deaf ears. Throughout this development, the government has used its influence on all parties to urge restraint, negotiation, and a peaceful solution.

    Attempting to impose a solution by force or the threat of force disregards the rights of nations, just as it disregards international treaties and obligations.

    The Indian government also regrets to learn from newspaper reports that pilots of British, French, Italian, and other nationalities are being withdrawn. This action is not intended to promote the use of the canal and is therefore not in the interests of the user countries.

    The Indian government hopes that none of its statements will hinder efforts to ease tensions and open the way for negotiations.

    But the Indian government cannot but point out that the step announced of managing the canal without the consent and cooperation of the Egyptian government is intended to create great difficulties for peaceful avenues, and this step also contains a serious danger of causing conflict.

    I want to say that I was surprised and regretful when I read the news of Sir Anthony Eden's speech, because it seemed to close the door to further negotiations. The actions contemplated are fraught with dangerous possibilities and far-reaching consequences. I sincerely believe that even now, it is not too late to pull back from the brink, not to take any such action, and to give more consideration to seeking a solution through peaceful negotiations. Only a solution sought through peaceful negotiations can achieve the desired goal: to enable the Suez Canal to operate normally for the benefit of all countries concerned and to help maintain friendly relations in the Middle East and throughout Asia. As I pointed out earlier, the normal operation of the Suez Canal is of vital interest to India. But we believe that to achieve this goal, only a solution achieved through peaceful negotiations can guarantee not only the rights of Egypt, but also the rights of all user countries.

### 印度总理尼赫鲁  关于苏彝士运河问题的声明——9月13日在印度人民院发表——

    印度总理尼赫鲁
    关于苏彝士运河问题的声明
    ——9月13日在印度人民院发表——
    新华社新德里15日电　印度总理尼赫鲁9月13日在人民院发表的关于苏彝士运河问题的声明，全文如下：
    我想对苏彝士运河问题最近的事态发展说几句话。本来我是想在一两天以后我们掌握了更充分的情报的时候才发表声明的。目前，我们已经看到了关于联合王国首相艾登昨天在英国下院发表的演说的报纸消息。
    但是，由于议会将在今天晚上休会，我在一段时间内将没有机会发表任何声明，因此我就在现在讲几句话。
    人民院知道我们作了认真的努力来促使苏彝士运河问题通过谈判得到解决。我们看得很清楚，对待这个问题的任何其他途径，或者强加一种决定的任何企图，不仅不会带来所期望的结果，而且可能引起严重得多的后果，这种后果的严重程度是不可能预见的。在伦敦举行的会议上，我们尽我们所有力量要求采取步骤来实现谈判并且提出了某些一般的建议。锡兰、印度尼西亚和苏联支持我们的这些建议。但是，出席会议的大多数国家采取了一种大家所知道的不同的方针。
    从关于昨天艾登爵士的演说的报纸消息中，不可能充分估计据说联合王国、法国和美国政府考虑采取的行动的意义和含意，在我们通过官方来源得到更详细的报告以前我们还不能估计。
    三国政府打算采取的据称是为了运河使用者的利益和维持运河的使用自由的行动至少可以说是令人吃惊的，而可能由此所产生的后果很可能是非常严重的。有一件事是很清楚的，那就是打算采取的行动不是协议、合作和同意的结果，而是要片面地采取的，因此具有强加的，决定的性质。
    印度政府对这种发展深为遗憾，这种发展很不平常，并且将使和平解决更难于实现。它不是为了要使用国能够和平而安全地使用运河，而这应当是，并且的确是使用国和国际社会所要求的。
    最近访问了开罗的孟席斯代表团曾要求埃及政府接受对运河的经营和管理进行国际管制，并且设立一个国际公司来代替埃及的国家公司。埃及拒绝接受这些建议，因为它们是违反它的主权的，是同1888年公约的目的和使用国的利益无关的，这些目的和利益是：运河的通行自由、通行税和保养等等，而这些是只有埃及政府能够保证的。
    埃及政府的答复已打开了谈判的道路。印度政府认为，这种谈判本可以导致一种解决，这种解决既能满足使用国和国际社会的一切需要而又不损害或剥夺埃及的主权和它对公认是埃及的不可分割的一部分的运河的民族权利。
    我在前几天已经把我们的看法通知了联合王国首相和美利坚合众国总统：在孟席斯代表团的使命结束和埃及政府发表了接受一切国际义务和要求进行谈判的声明以后所出现的局势，打开了求得解决的道路。我们吁请联合王国和美国考虑这一切并且使得将会导致解决的谈判能够得到发展。我们希望，尽管发生了已经发生的一切情况并且已经引起了紧张局势，大家还是走和平的道路。在这里，谈不上姑息一方或另一方的问题，因为要寻求的和我们认为能够获得的，是一种对于一切有关方面都是满意的和光荣的解决。
    印度政府诚恳地希望我们提出的呼吁不致落空。政府在这一发展的整个过程中利用他们对各方的影响来要求克制、谈判和和平的解决。
    企图凭借武力或以武力相威胁来强加一种解决，是不顾各国的权利，正如不遵守国际条约和义务一样。
    印度政府还遗憾地从报纸消息中知道英、法、意及其他国籍的引水员正在被撤回。这种行动不是打算促进运河的使用的，因此是不符合使用国家的利益的。
    印度政府希望，它的任何声明都不会妨碍缓和紧张局势和为谈判打开道路的努力。
    但是印度政府不能不指出，所宣布的那种不得埃及政府的同意和合作就对运河实行管理的步骤是有意要给和平途径造成极大的困难，并且这种步骤还包含着引起冲突的严重危险。
    我要说的是：我读到艾登爵士的演说消息时感到惊奇和遗憾，因为它似乎关闭了进一步谈判的大门。其中考虑到的行动充满着危险的可能性和影响深远的后果。我真诚地相信，即使在现在，悬崖勒马、不采取任何这类行动而更多地考虑用和平谈判的办法求得解决，为时还不太晚。只有通过和平谈判求得解决的办法才能够达到预期的这样一个目的：使苏彝士运河能正常工作以造福于有关的一切国家并有助于在中东地区以及整个亚洲地区维持友好的关系。正如我以前所指出的，苏彝士运河的正常工作对于印度有切身的利害关系。但是我们相信，要达到这一目的，只有通过和平谈判取得的不仅保证埃及的、同时也保证所有使用国的权利的解决办法。
