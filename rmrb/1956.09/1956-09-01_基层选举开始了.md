    Basic-Level Elections Begin
    Like celebrating a festival
    Before I even reached Caishikou, I could see from afar that the shops were adorned with bright red banners and huge slogans. The banners read: "Warmly Welcome the 1956 Basic-Level Elections." Xuanwu District is focusing on conducting pilot work for basic-level elections here.
    This is truly a major event. These days, the entire district feels like it's celebrating a festival. The walls of streets and alleys are covered with red voter lists, and large golden "happiness" characters are pasted on the voter lists. The blackboards in the hutongs are also filled with information about the elections. After six o'clock in the afternoon, the streets become even more lively. Over seventy or eighty loudspeakers throughout the district are broadcasting about the elections.
    The cadres of the Xuanwu District Election Committee and various working groups have been extremely busy these days. Various parties and organizations have consulted and discussed the candidates, and then widely conveyed the consultation process to the voters.
    A preliminary list of representative candidates is now available. To understand the candidates, voter representatives have begun to conduct individual interviews. This has made the agencies where the candidates work extremely busy. The visiting voter representatives ask questions very carefully, afraid of missing even a small detail, so they can report back to the voters. The Xuanwu District People's Committee has assigned three cadres to specifically receive visitors and provide detailed information about the candidates' work performance. These three cadres talk from morning till night and are still having trouble keeping up.
    Some cadres haven't had a good night's sleep for days. During the day, the cadres in the office are busy going to various electoral districts to understand the situation, and at night they seize the time to study how to guide the work. The cadres of the working groups have to participate in voter group leader meetings, mass meetings, and street activist meetings day and night, trying various ways to understand the masses' opinions on the preliminary list of candidates.
    The masses also meet each other and inquire: How is this candidate? Is that one good? They say: Electing representatives is not a joke, we must conscientiously elect people who are enthusiastic about serving the people to the People's Congress! (Zheng)

    In a Meeting
    Just after breakfast, more than twenty people gathered in the meeting room of the 60th Middle School. These people are representatives from various agencies, factories, schools, and strata in the Baizhifang electoral district of Xuanwu District. Today they are going to complete an important task - put forward preliminary opinions on candidates for district people's representatives in this electoral district, providing reference for joint nominations by various parties and organizations in the district through consultation.
    Everyone was talking about the results of yesterday's group deliberation of the list when the chairman announced the start of the meeting. The young chairman, Ding Qiwen, told everyone that the quota of representatives produced by this electoral district is eleven. Yesterday, everyone put forward twenty-three candidates at the meeting. After group research, most of them have reached a consensus, but there are still inconsistent opinions on five of the six street-level candidates. He hoped that everyone would carefully study them again today; if there are more suitable candidates, everyone can also put them forward.
    Some of the street-level candidates participated in this meeting; therefore, someone suggested that when discussing their opinions, they should be asked to recuse themselves so that everyone can express their opinions without any concerns. Then, everyone launched a lively discussion. Zhao Wenting, a vegetable farmer from Nancaoyuan, can represent the opinions of farmers, and he is also the original representative. Everyone preliminarily agreed that he should be a candidate. The other five are all street activists, and they have all achieved certain results in serving the residents, and each has its own strengths and weaknesses. How to compare them? This is indeed a very difficult thing. At this time, someone thought that in addition to considering the representative's ability to serve the people, it is also necessary to take into account regional balance and the ability to represent the opinions of all parties. Subsequently, someone proposed Xu Shumin from Nancaoyuan, a housewife who has outstanding achievements in security and family work. Someone suggested He Shiying, a worker's family member, is patient in her work, so she can also be a candidate, but she is from Nancaoyuan. After repeated discussions, everyone finally agreed that Xu Shumin should be a candidate and He Shiying should be an alternate candidate. Finally, everyone present signed the list of candidates to express their agreement. (Dian Yi)

### 基层选举开始了

    基层选举开始了
    像过年过节一样
    还没有走到菜市口，老远就看见商店门口挂着鲜红的幛子和巨大的标语牌，牌上写着：“热烈迎接1956年的基层选举”，宣武区正在这里进行基层选举的重点试办工作。
    这可真是件大事。这些天全区简直像过年过节一样，大街小巷的墙上贴着红色的选民榜，选民榜上又贴了老大的金色喜字。胡同里的黑板报上也写的都是有关选举的事。下午六点多钟以后，街上更热闹了。全区七、八十个大喇叭都在广播关于选举的事情。
    宣武区选举委员会和各个工作组的干部们，这些天一个个忙得十分紧张。各党派、团体协商和讨论了候选人，接着就普遍向选民传达协商的经过。
    代表候选人的初步名单现在是有了，为了了解候选人，选民代表开始进行个别访问。这一下，候选人所在的机关忙起来了，来访的选民代表问得仔细极了，生怕漏掉一点，回去没法向选民交代。宣武区人民委员会派了三个干部专门接待来访者，详细介绍候选人的工作表现。这三个干部从早说到晚，还有点儿接应不过来。
    这几天有的干部连着几天没好好睡过一觉。办公室的干部白天忙着到各选区了解情况，晚上还抓紧时间，研究如何指导工作。工作组的干部，白天晚上都要参加选民小组长会、群众会、街道积极分子会，想各种办法了解群众对候选人初步名单的意见。
    群众见面也是互相打听：这个候选人怎么样？那个好不好？他们说：选代表可不是闹着玩的，咱们要认真地把热心为大伙办事的人选到人民代表大会里去！　（正）
    在一次会议上
    刚吃过早饭，就有二十几个人聚集到六十中学的会议室，这些人都是宣武区白纸坊选区各机关、工厂、学校和各阶层的代表人物。今天他们要完成一项重要的任务——提出本选区区人民代表候选人的初步意见，提供区里各党派、团体协商联合提名时参考。
    大家正在交谈昨天分组酝酿名单的情况，主席宣布开会了。年轻的主席丁启文告诉大家，这个选区产生代表的名额是十一个人，昨天大家在会上提出了二十三位候选人，分组研究的结果，大部分已经取得一致意见，只是在六位街道方面的候选人当中，对其中五人的意见还不一致，希望今天再仔细研究一下；如果有更合适的人选，大家还可以提出来。
    街道方面的候选人，有的参加了这次会；因此有人提议，在讨论对他们意见的时候，请他们回避一下，以便大家能毫无顾虑地发表意见。接着，大家展开了热烈的讨论。南菜园菜农赵文亭能够代表农民意见，而且他还是原来的代表，大家初步同意他作候选人。其他五个人都是街道的积极分子，为居民办事都有一定的成绩，而且各有长短，怎么比呢？这却是件很为难的事。这时有人想到除了考虑代表为人民办事的能力以外，还要照顾到地区平衡和能够代表各方面的意见。随着，有人提出了南菜园的徐淑敏，是家庭妇女，作治安工作和家属工作有较突出的成绩。有人提出工人家属何世英，工作耐心，因此她也可以做候选人，但是她是南菜园的。这些意见经过反复讨论，最后一致同意徐淑敏做候选人，何世英做候补候选人。最后每个到会的人都在候选人名单上签了字，表示同意。　（甸义）
