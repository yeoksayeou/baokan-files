Xinhua News Agency dispatch: A large number of researchers from the Institute of Geology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences set off in April this year to conduct geological surveys in the field.

    Scientists from the Institute of Geology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and professors from the Beijing Institute of Geology are conducting geological surveys in the Qilian Mountains. Under the guidance of Soviet advisors, they led groups of young geological scientists and have successfully completed mountain crossing missions on four routes.

    Researchers conducting geological surveys in the Qaidam Basin this year will be working in the center of the basin and around the Altyn Mountains, Qilian Mountains, and Kunlun Mountains surrounding the basin. Through the study of the basin's strata and geological structures, they will propose scientific basis for the petroleum prospect evaluation and exploration work in the area.

    Some geologists, along with Soviet advisors, are conducting geological surveys in South China, Southwest China, Northwest China, and parts of the Tibetan Plateau, understanding the geotectonic structures of these areas and their metallogenic relationship with endogenic and exogenic deposits.

    The Xiaoxinganling Geological Team, participating in the Sino-Soviet joint comprehensive survey of the Heilongjiang River basin, is currently working along the Heilongjiang River.

    Also departing for fieldwork are the Quaternary Geology Team participating in the comprehensive survey of soil and water conservation in the middle reaches of the Yellow River, the Geological Survey Team for sedimentary deposits, the Sedimentary Chemistry Research Team, the Rare Element Mineral and Deposit Research Team, and the Stratigraphy Research Team. In coordination with relevant departments, geological surveys and research are being conducted on the ultramafic rocks and chromite in Inner Mongolia, earthquake geology, and the karst topography of the Three Gorges of the Yangtze River.

    The work carried out by the Institute of Geology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences this year is in close cooperation with relevant industrial departments and universities, and has received strong support and assistance from local Party committees and government departments.

    地质研究所大批研究人员
    在各地进行地质调查工作
    据新华社讯　中国科学院地质研究所的研究人员，今年4月份，陆续出发野外进行地质调查工作。
    在祁连山进行地质调查工作的，有中国科学院地质研究所的科学家和北京地质学院的教授。他们在苏联顾问指导下，分头带领了一批青年地质科学工作者，已经胜利完成了四条路线的穿山任务。
    在柴达木盆地进行地质调查的研究人员，今年将分别在盆地中心和围绕盆地的阿尔金山、祁连山和昆仑山进行工作。通过对盆地地层和地质构造的研究，提出本区石油远景评价和勘探工作的科学根据。
    一部分地质学家则同苏联顾问在华南、西南、西北等地区及西藏高原的一部分地区进行地质考察，了解了这些地区的大地构造及其与内生矿床和外生矿床的成矿关系。
    参加中苏合作的黑龙江流域综合考察队的小兴安岭地质队，现正在黑龙江沿岸进行工作。
    先后出发野外的，还有参加黄河中游水土保持综合考察队的第四纪地质队、研究沉积矿床的地质调查队、沉积化学研究队、稀有元素矿物及矿床研究队、地层研究队等。与有关部门配合进行地质调查和研究的，还有内蒙古超基性岩及铬铁矿的调查、地震地质的调查，长江三峡喀斯特地形的研究。
    中国科学院地质研究所今年所进行的这些工作，都和有关的产业部门以及高等学校取得密切合作，并得到地方党委和政府部门的大力支持和协助。
