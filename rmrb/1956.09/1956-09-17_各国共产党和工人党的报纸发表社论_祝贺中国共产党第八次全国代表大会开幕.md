    Communist and Workers' Parties' Newspapers Publish Editorials
    Congratulating the Opening of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China
    "People's Tribune" of Poland
    The Polish "People's Tribune" published an editorial on September 15 stating that the strength of the Chinese Communist Party and the important role of the People's Republic of China on the international stage will make the Eighth National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party a major political event.
    The organ of the Polish United Workers' Party emphasized that the source of the Chinese Communist Party's victory, along with its vitality and creative ideological theory, lies in the Party's close connection with the broad masses of the people through its general policies and working methods. This close connection between the Chinese Communist Party and the masses of the people is primarily manifested in the fact that all the Party's measures are adapted to its own unique social circumstances, traditions, and specific conditions.
    The editorial listed the achievements of the Chinese Communist Party in industrial construction, agricultural transformation, and the transformation of private industry and commerce. The editorial stated that the democratic manifestation of the Chinese Party is its effort to strengthen close unity with non-Party members. The Party is strengthening the democratic united front and expressing long-term coexistence and cooperation with other democratic parties. The Chinese Communist Party states that it advocates free thought in literature, art, and scientific research, advocates free discussion and creative labor, and advocates the free expression of opinions and the maintenance of one's views when debating issues.
    The editorial concluded by pointing out that this congress will make the Chinese Communist Party stronger, enrich the Party's thinking, and enable the Chinese people to achieve greater achievements in building socialism and strengthening the People's Republic of China.
    "Spark" of Romania
    The Romanian Workers' Party's organ "Spark" wrote that the international significance of the Eighth National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party lies in the fact that the Chinese Communist Party is the leading force guiding the great people of China to advance rapidly along the road of socialism. It is of great importance for consolidating the entire socialist family and consolidating the world's forces for peace and progress.
    Romanian Communists and the entire people wish the Chinese Communists and the entire people, armed with the decisions of the congress, greater victories in the struggle to build socialism and defend peace.
    "Unity" of Albania
    The Albanian "Unity" published an editorial on September 15, congratulating the opening of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China.
    The editorial said: The heroic Chinese Communist Party is the inspirer, organizer, and leader of the Chinese people in the struggle for liberation and the struggle to build a socialist country.
    Sincere and fraternal relations have been established between the Albanian Labor Party and the Chinese Communist Party. The friendly relations between the Albanian people and the fraternal Chinese people are growing stronger and more consolidated.
    The newspaper concluded by saying that on the occasion of the opening of the Eighth National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, the Albanian people extend their warmest congratulations to the fraternal Chinese people.
    "People's Daily" of Vietnam
    The Vietnamese "People's Daily" published an editorial on the 16th entitled "Warmly Congratulating the Glorious Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China," saying that the road of struggle of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people is long and arduous, but also an incomparably glorious road of struggle. The vigorously rising high tide of the Chinese socialist revolution makes all the Vietnamese people extremely excited and further encourages them to strive for a peaceful, unified, independent, democratic, and prosperous Vietnam. The generous and selfless assistance of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people to the Vietnamese people is a noble manifestation of the friendship between the people of our two countries and the profound internationalist solidarity between our two parties.
    After the 20th Congress of the CPSU, the convening of the Eighth National Congress of the CPC will certainly play a huge role in the socialist movement and the cause of world peace.
    The editorial concluded by congratulating the success of the congress.
    "Labor News" of Korea
    The Korean "Labor News" published an editorial on September 15, congratulating the opening of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China.
    The editorial stated that the Eighth National Congress of the CPC is an event of great significance in the lives of the Chinese people and in the international workers' movement. The victory of the Chinese revolution and the epoch-making achievements in the cause of socialist construction after the victory show the great creativity displayed by the Chinese people under the strong and wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. This once again proves the eternally victorious and invincible power of Marxism-Leninism.
    The editorial pointed out that the Chinese Communist Party has closely combined Marxist-Leninist theory with the practice of the Chinese revolution, and has set an excellent example in creatively applying Marxism-Leninism based on China's specific conditions. The glorious struggle history of the great Soviet Communist Party and the rich experience accumulated by the Chinese Communist Party have great practical and theoretical significance for the development of the socialist cause throughout the world.
    The editorial stated that the Korean Labor Party, from the first day of its establishment, has often used the struggle experience of the Soviet Communist Party and the Chinese Communist Party as a mirror. The Korean people believe that the eternal friendship and unity with the fraternal Chinese people is one of the reliable guarantees for achieving final victory in their struggle.
