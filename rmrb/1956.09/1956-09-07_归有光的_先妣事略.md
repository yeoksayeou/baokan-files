Gui Youguang's "Zhenchuan Collection" contains a very good lyrical essay called "A Brief Biography of My Late Mother." The author lists the trivial matters of his mother, showing her perfect personality, thereby expressing his admiration. Before liberation, this article was often selected into Chinese textbooks for middle school students to read as a model essay. Today, I am not going to talk about how well-written and moving this article is; I will only discuss the facts listed in the first paragraph of the article, in conjunction with the current situation, as questions to be raised.

The article begins by saying: "My late mother, née Zhou, was born on the eleventh day of the second month of the Hongzhi first year (1488). She came to our family at the age of sixteen. The following year, she gave birth to a daughter, Shujing—Shujing was my eldest sister. A year later, Youguang was born. Another year later, a daughter and a son were born: one died young, and one was infertile after a year. Another year later, Youshang was born, after a twelve-month pregnancy. Another year later, Shushun was born. A year later, Yougong was born. When Yougong was born, Madam Zhou was healthier than when she nursed her other children. However, she often frowned and said to the maids, 'I suffer from having too many children.' An old woman brought two snails in a cup of water and said, 'Drink this, and you will not conceive so often.' Madam Zhou drank it all, and was immediately unable to speak. On the twenty-third day of the fifth month of the eighth year of Zhengde (1513), Madam Zhou died."

It first tells us that in feudal times, the landlord class generally married early in order to have many children and grandchildren. Gui Youguang's mother married at the age of sixteen, actually not even sixteen yet, because Chinese people have always calculated age without counting the incomplete year. Gui Youguang's mother had six pregnancies in the ten years from her marriage to her death, one of which was twins. This tells us that excessive childbearing by women has long been a problem. At present, the problem of early marriage has been solved, because the Marriage Law stipulates that "men must be twenty years old and women must be eighteen years old before they can marry." However, the problem of women having too many children is even more serious than before, because today's women are different from women in feudal society; they participate in various construction works like men, and excessive childbearing not only affects their health but also affects their work.

As a result, all kinds of contraception methods have been publicly promoted. Among them, there are also folk remedies. When Mr. Shao Lizi spoke at the National People's Congress two months ago, he introduced a folk remedy that was said to be "effective, reliable, and inexpensive": "Use tadpoles produced in the spring, wash them clean in cold boiled water, and swallow fourteen live ones three or four days after menstruation, and then swallow ten more the next day, which can prevent pregnancy for five years. If you still want to prevent pregnancy in the future, continue to swallow twice, and you can be permanently infertile." This made me think of the contraceptive folk remedy introduced to Madam Gui by the "old woman" in the Gui household: swallowing two live snails. "Two snails in a cup of water," and you can "drink it all" (swallow it in one gulp). The two snails were certainly without shells, and may have been "washed clean" with water. As for whether cold boiled water was used, we don't know. That folk remedy must have been very popular among the people at that time, so the "old woman" was very confident in telling Madam Gui, "Drink this, and you will not conceive so often." But what was the result of swallowing it? "She was immediately unable to speak," and died from then on! How the kind-hearted "old woman" expressed herself at that time was not written in Gui Youguang's article, but it can be imagined that she must have been full of remorse.

In my opinion, these two contraceptive folk remedies are of the same origin but different prescriptions, because snails and tadpoles are both aquatic animals, and according to the traditional Chinese medicine saying, both animals are "cold." Of course, Mr. Shao Lizi introduced this contraceptive folk remedy much more cautiously than the "old woman" in the Gui household. He explained that this folk remedy was told to him by Mr. Ye Xichun, an advanced practitioner of traditional Chinese medicine; and he also warned us that "some folk secret prescriptions" "are still inevitably dangerous and should not be tried casually"; he hoped that the Ministry of Health would study them and "announce the results of the research as soon as possible." He did not imitate the "old woman" by putting fourteen live tadpoles in a cup of water and gently saying to the parturient woman, "Drink this, and you will not conceive so often." But Mr. Shao did not think that if the Ministry of Health uses experimental methods to conduct research, it will have to wait five years before announcing the results of the research. Who can guarantee that women comrades who "suffer from having too many children" will be able to patiently wait for five years without "trying it casually"? If this folk remedy is "inevitably dangerous" like the folk remedy of swallowing two live snails, and someone "tries it casually" and has a "dangerous" experience like Madam Gui, wouldn't Mr. Shao also be full of remorse? In the past few years, Mr. Shao has spared no effort in promoting various contraceptive methods in order to solve the problem of "suffering from having too many children" for women comrades. Such a kind heart will move anyone. However, if an accident occurs because of choosing a method in a hurry, then a kind heart will not get good results. – The lesson is not far away, that is, the "old woman" in the Gui household in Kunshan County, Jiangsu in the 1510s.

    归有光的“先妣事略”
    宋云彬
    归有光的“震川集”里有一篇很好的抒情文叫“先妣事略”。作者列叙母亲的琐事，显出她的完美的人格，从而抒写他的爱慕的情怀。解放以前，这篇文章常常被选入国文课本，给中学生当范文读。我今天并不是要谈这篇文章写得怎么好，怎么动人；只就文章第一段所列叙的事实，配合当前某些情况，作为问题提出来谈谈。
    文章开头说：“先妣周孺人，弘治元年（1488）二月十一日生。年十六，来归。逾年，生女淑静——淑静者，大姊也。期而生有光。又期而生女、子：殇一人，期而不育者一人。又逾年，生有尚，妊十二月。逾年，生淑顺。一岁，又生有功。有功之生也，孺人比乳他子加健。然数颦蹙顾诸婢曰：‘吾为多子苦。’老妪以杯水盛二螺进，曰：‘饮此后妊不数矣。’孺人举之尽，暗不能言。正德八年（1513 ）五月二十三日，孺人卒”。
    它首先告诉我们在封建时代，地主阶级为要子孙满堂，大都是早婚的。归有光的母亲十六岁出嫁，实际还不满十六岁，因为我们中国人一向算年龄是不算足岁的。归有光的母亲从出嫁到死整整十年当中做了六次产，其中一次而且是双胞胎。这就告诉我们，妇女的生育过多早已成为问题了。在目前，早婚问题已经解决，因为婚姻法规定“男二十岁，女十八岁，始得结婚”。但是妇女生育过多的问题倒比以前更加严重，因为现在的妇女跟封建社会时代的妇女不同，她们跟男子一样参加各项建设工作，生育过多不但影响健康，而且影响工作。
    于是乎，种种避孕的方法都拿出来作公开宣传了。其中也有单方。邵力子先生两个月前在全国人民代表大会会议上发言的时候，就介绍了一个据说是“灵验，稳当，又不费钱”的单方：“用春天产生的蝌蚪虫，在冷开水中冲洗干净，行经后三四日活吞十四条，次日再吞十条，可以避孕五年之久，以后倘仍要避孕，续吞二次，可以永久不受孕”。这就使我联想到归府上的“老妪”向归太太介绍的那个避孕单方：活吞两个田螺。“以杯水盛二螺”，而又可以“举之尽”（一口吞下去）。那两个田螺当然是不带壳的，而且也可能用水“冲洗干净”了的，至于是不是用的冷开水，那我们就不知道了。那个单方当时一定在民间很流行，所以那“老妪”才很有把握地告诉归太太说，“饮此后妊不数矣”。但是吞下去的结果怎么样呢？“喑不能言”，而且从此一命呜呼了！那个好心肠的“老妪”当时怎么样表示，归有光的文章里没有写出来，但可以想像得到，一定是悔恨万状的。
    据我的看法，这两个避孕单方是同源异方，因为田螺跟蝌蚪同是水生动物，而且照中医的传统说法，这两种动物都是属于“寒凉”的。当然邵力子先生介绍这个避孕单方要比归府上的那位“老妪”慎重得多。他说明这个单方是中医先进者叶熙春代表告诉他的；又告诫我们，“民间秘方”“有的还难免危险，不好随便尝试”；他希望卫生部加以研究，并且“早日公布研究的结果”。他并不模仿那“老妪”，以杯水盛十四条活的蝌蚪，送到产妇嘴边，轻轻地说，“饮此后妊不数矣”。但是邵先生没有想到，卫生部如果用实验方法来作研究，要等到五年以后才能公布研究的结果。谁能担保
  “为多子苦”的妇女同志们都能够耐心等待五年，而不去“随便尝试”呢？假如这个单方跟那活吞两个田螺的单方一样“难免危险”的话，有人“随便尝试”而发生了类如归太太那样的“危险”，邵先生不是也要悔恨万状吗？邵先生这几年来为要给妇女同志们解决“多子苦”的问题，宣传各种避孕方法真可谓不遗余力，这样的一付好心肠谁也会感动。但是，如果因为急不择方而居然发生了意外，那么好心肠倒反得不到好结果了。——殷鉴不远，就是十六世纪十年代江苏昆山县归府上的那个“老妪”。
