Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, September 3rd: According to the Press Trust of India in Kathmandu, Nepalese Prime Minister Tanka Prasad Acharya said on September 2nd that his planned visit to China in September would not affect Nepal's neutrality in the slightest.

He said that the purpose of his visit was to bring the friendship and goodwill of the people on this side of the Himalayas to the people on the other side of the Himalayas. "I will visit the neighbor who shares the great Himalayas with us and lives across the mountains from us. It is only natural for the two neighboring countries to strengthen their ties."

Acharya said that Nepal is located between its two major neighbors, India and China. "Both countries are also our great friends. Nepal should always be a reliable link between the two countries."

The Nepalese Prime Minister explained his statement that he was not seeking any material benefits in China, saying, "We have friends, and friends are willing to help us. We will definitely accept all sincere help from our neighbors, as well as help from friends afar, as long as accepting it does not harm our dignity."

A reporter asked Acharya what kind of neutrality he hoped Nepal would pursue – Swiss-style or some other form.

The Nepalese Prime Minister replied, "I don't know how many kinds of neutrality there are. But we are willing to develop neutrality in this way: under this neutrality, Nepal will be able to dedicate itself to the cause of peace and express sympathy for the oppressed. We do not want a group system in human relations. We hope to establish open and honest relations between neighbors and countries on the basis of common cooperation and co-existence."

    尼泊尔首相月内访问我国
    新华社新德里3日电　据印度报业托辣斯加德满都消息，尼泊尔首相坦卡·普拉萨德·阿查里雅9月2日说，他预定在9月间前往中国进行的访问丝毫不会影响尼泊尔的中立。
    他说，他访问的目的是把喜马拉雅山这边人民的友谊和亲善之意带给喜马拉雅山那一边的人民。“我将去访问和我们共有伟大的喜马拉雅山、和我们隔山而居的邻邦。两个邻邦加强它们的联系是很自然的事。”
    阿查里雅说，尼泊尔位于两大邻邦印度和中国之间。“两国也都是我们伟大的朋友。尼泊尔应当永远是两国之间的可靠的环节”。
    尼泊尔首相解释他所说他到中国不是为了寻求任何物质利益的这句话说，“我们有朋友，朋友们是愿意帮助我们的。我们肯定要接受邻邦的一切真诚的帮助，同样接受远方朋友的帮助，只要接受并不损害我们的尊严。”
    有记者问阿查里雅，他希望尼泊尔奉行什么样的中立——瑞士式的还是其他形式的。
    尼泊尔首相回答说，“我不知道中立有多少种。但是我们愿意这样发展中立：在这种中立下，尼泊尔将能够献身于和平事业，对被压迫者表示同情。我们不希望在人类关系中有集团制度。我们希望在共同合作共处的基础上在邻邦和各国之间建立开诚布公的关系。”
