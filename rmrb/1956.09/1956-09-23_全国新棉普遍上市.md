New Cotton Universally Available Across the Country

    This newspaper reports that since the beginning of September, new cotton has been universally available across the country. Currently, agricultural production cooperatives in Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Hubei, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Xinjiang, Sichuan, Yunnan, Hunan, Jiangxi, Liaoning, Zhejiang, and other regions are actively drying, picking, and cleaning the harvested cotton to sell to the state.

    According to preliminary statistics from the Department of Agricultural Product Procurement, over 4.2 million jin of ginned cotton and over 25 million jin of seed cotton have been purchased nationwide. Hubei, Henan, Hebei, and Shandong provinces have purchased the largest quantities of cotton. As of September 5th, Hubei Province had collected over 5.83 million jin of seed cotton. The amount of new cotton on the market is gradually increasing in other regions such as Jiangxi, Hunan, Liaoning, and Shanxi provinces. Shandong Province currently has the highest cotton collection volume, with the province's daily seed cotton collection reaching over 2.4 million jin.

    The quality of this year's new cotton is generally good. The first-picked cotton acquired in Hebei Province is mostly graded at level five. Compared to the initial cotton quality last year, this year's cotton quality has not been reduced by the flood disaster. The majority of the Dai-character cotton in Shandong Province is of excellent quality, with bright color, long fiber, and a high ginning output. Due to the improvement in cotton quality, cotton farmers can earn two to three yuan more for every 100 jin of seed cotton sold compared to last year, greatly increasing cotton farmers' planting income.

    In order to assist agricultural production cooperatives in doing a good job in cotton picking, storage, ginning, and sales, ensuring cotton quality, and avoiding adulteration and mixing, this year, before the new cotton went on the market, agricultural product procurement departments in most regions universally conducted cotton grading technology training for agricultural cooperative cadres. Jianyang County, Sichuan Province, helped agricultural cooperatives train 109 cotton grading personnel, which will play a certain role in further implementing the policy of "high quality cotton, high price," and increasing cotton farmers' income. After the members of the eighth production team of the Ge Village Agricultural Cooperative in Shahe County, Hebei Province, adopted the method of separate picking and separate selling of cotton last year, they sold 1,320 jin of seed cotton and earned fifteen yuan more because the grades were not mixed and the quality was improved. In addition, in terms of cotton collection methods, cotton purchasing stations in many regions have adopted organized and planned purchasing methods, such as dividing areas, designating locations, and scheduling sales, which has basically improved and overcome the chaotic phenomenon of cotton farmers queuing and crowding to sell cotton in the past.

### 全国新棉普遍上市

    全国新棉普遍上市
    本报讯　自9月上旬以来，全国新棉已普遍上市。目前河北、山东、河南、湖北、陕西、山西、新疆、四川、云南、湖南、江西、辽宁、浙江等地的农业生产合作社，正积极地把已收摘的棉花，晒干拣净卖给国家。
    据农产品采购部的初步统计，全国已收购皮棉四百二十余万斤，籽棉二千五百万斤以上。其中以湖北、河南、河北、山东等省收购的棉花数量为最多。湖北省到9月5日止，已收籽棉达五百八十三万多斤。其他地区如江西、湖南、辽宁、山西等省新棉上市数量正日渐增多。目前收棉数量最多的是山东省，全省日收籽棉量已达二百四十万斤以上。
    今年新棉品质一般良好。河北省已收购的头喷棉花，等级大部为五级。同去年初期棉花品质相比较，今年棉花的质量，并未因洪水灾害而降低。山东省的大部岱字棉，品质优良，色泽光润，绒长衣分大。由于棉花质量的提高，今年棉农每售籽棉一百斤，就可比去年多卖棉款两三元，棉农植棉收益因而大大增加。
    为了帮助农业生产合作社做好棉花的分摘、分存、分轧，分售工作，保证棉花质量，不掺不混，今年大部地区的农产品采购部门，在新棉上市前，普遍地向农业社干部进行了棉花验级技术的传授工作。四川省简阳县帮助农业社训练了棉花分级人员一百零九名，这对进一步贯彻优棉优价政策，增加棉农收益，都会起到一定作用。河北省沙河县葛村农业社第八生产队的社员，去年采用了分摘分售棉花的方法后，因等级不混，质量提高，出售籽棉一千三百二十斤，就多卖了棉款十五元。此外在收棉方法上，今年不少地区的棉花采购站，由于采取了有组织有计划，划片，定点、约时出售的采购方法，像过去那种棉农售棉排队拥挤的混乱现象，已基本得到改善和克服。
