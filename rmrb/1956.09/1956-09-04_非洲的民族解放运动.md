	The National Liberation Movement in Africa
	By Derek Kartun, England
	Africa is a vast continent. The people of Africa speak seven hundred languages and represent a variety of cultures. Africa has abundant natural resources, most of which are untapped. However, despite Africa's endless riches, hunger is a common phenomenon. Millions have nothing but rags to cover their bodies.
	Africa has long been a piece of meat for old-line imperialist countries - Britain, France, Belgium, Portugal, Spain - to plunder. After the liberation of most of Asia, Africa's significance as a source of profit, a producer of cheap raw materials, and an important strategic base has become unparalleled for capitalist countries. Africa not only has various beneficial minerals, great potential for agricultural development, and cheap labor, but has also become the southern bastion of a chain of offensive bases established by imperialist countries to oppose the socialist world. There are huge armories in British East Africa. Morocco has the largest U.S. overseas air base, and Libya has a huge Anglo-American base. The industrial capacity of the Union of South Africa can be quickly converted to arms production. It produces strategic raw materials: copper, chromium, diamonds, gold, iron ore, manganese, tin, uranium...
	It is clear that Africa's significance to imperialist countries and even the entire capitalist world is immeasurable.
	There is no doubt that Africa is rising up. Almost the entire continent has begun to seethe. This is one of the greatest events in human history, and it has immeasurable significance for Africans and people of other continents.
	The famous American journalist and writer John Gunther wrote in his book about Africa: "Most of Africa is much like pre-war Asia - Asia yearning for liberation. And this is perfectly legitimate. No matter what people's skin color is, they cannot be deprived of their right to yearn for freedom. Africa is, after all, a continent for Africans."
	The famous scholar, African-American Dr. Du Bois, emphasized: "Now that the West has lost the possibility of plundering Asia, it is turning its attention to the richest El Dorado that has been opened up by the industrial revolution, and that is the new Africa, the Africa of the twentieth century... However, due to the ever-increasing and more and more profitable exploitation of miserable labor, the whole of Africa is now in dire straits... At present, Africa possesses 98% of the world's diamond mining volume, 80% of cobalt, 75% of sisal production, 70% of palm oil, 70% of cocoa and chocolate, 60% of gold mining volume, 35% of phosphorus, 30% of chromium and manganese, 20% of copper, and 15% of coffee production. And it must be remembered that the continent's riches are only beginning to be utilized. Africa is a tempting object of plunder coveted by the capitalist world. But this cannot but arouse resistance, and today, from Tunis to Cape Town, the whole of Africa is ablaze."

		  Historical Situation
	By the mid-1890s, Africa had in fact been completely divided up by the imperialist powers, and at the same time, with a few exceptions, African resistance had been suppressed by cruel wars. But it was not until the advent of railways that the exploitation of the continent's natural resources truly began. First, there was the mining of gold and diamonds in the south and copper in the center, as well as various agricultural productions in the east and west. Large numbers of white colonists immigrated to southern, eastern, and central Africa, where the climate was relatively mild and free of tsetse flies. There is a saying in West Africa: "Tsetse flies are our soldiers, they do not allow white people to come here."
	The emergence of the African proletariat in mines and light industrial enterprises is a necessary result of Africa's economic development. In order to meet the needs of the increasing number of white residents, light industry developed rapidly in the south. At the same time, this also promoted the disintegration of the tribal system in African society. In the west, there emerged a large number of small farmers and agricultural workers. Africans began to receive limited education necessary for operating machine tools, driving cars, and completing basic social production tasks. In areas where the number of white residents was small, they received a more extensive education in order to train African officials.
	This is how the local bourgeoisie was produced. But this situation only occurred in a few countries.
	For example, in Kenya, where there are many white people, obstacles to the development of Africans have been deliberately created, and there is still no functional local bourgeoisie there. On the other hand, in the Gold Coast (West Africa), there is a prominent local bourgeoisie, and the imperialists are very willing to cooperate with them. In the Union of South Africa, the Strijdom fascist government is attempting to turn back the clock with the notorious Bantu "Education" Act. This act restricts the scope of education for Africans, strictly stipulating that they can only obtain the minimum amount of knowledge necessary for manual labor.
	Of course, the nature of the national liberation movement, its strength and maturity, are determined to a large extent by the above-mentioned circumstances.
	After World War II, the national liberation movement in Africa strengthened. Millions of Africans played a significant role in defeating fascism. They understood that this was a war against violence and for freedom, and they quickly concluded that Africans also have the right to freedom. By the end of the war, a completely new mood had emerged in Africa. For millions of people, concepts such as freedom, democracy, and national independence had become intimate and real. The desire for education and improved material conditions for many years began to be linked in their consciousness with broader demands. The political organizations and trade union organizations that arose throughout the continent after 1945 reflected this mood.
	The Nigerian railway workers' strike in 1942, the establishment of the National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons in 1944, and the political activation of Kenya - all these were the initial signs of the great awakening that had already appeared during the war. In 1945, there were large-scale strikes and demonstrations in Uganda, as well as an unprecedented general strike in Nigeria. In 1946, 60,000 gold miners in South Africa went on strike, the Kenya African Union became a mass organization, the Democratic Rally was established in French West Africa, and many other major events occurred in various parts of Africa.
	This was only the beginning. The African national liberation movement is expanding and maturing day by day. It has reached a particularly high level in the three countries of French North Africa - Morocco, Tunisia, and Algeria. During this period, four new independent countries emerged - Libya, Sudan, Morocco, and Tunisia. Finally, the Bandung Conference powerfully promoted the continued development of the African national liberation movement.
	It will be beneficial to talk about the national liberation movements of several of the most important and typical countries. First, it must be emphasized that information (I am talking about reliable information) is very scarce. Major mass events are often silent for months on end. However, the African national movement is so magnificent that it is no longer possible to completely conceal its true face from the world.

		  Union of South Africa
	At present, the most important mass actions are developing in three areas: the struggle against racial discrimination legislation - the Bantu Education Act, the struggle against the apartheid laws, and the movement to collect one million signatures for the "Freedom Charter."
	This movement is particularly important because it most clearly reflects the increasing solidarity of all progressive elements in the country, and the unity of Africans and Indians in the struggle against racial discrimination and for democracy. This charter was adopted at the South African People's Congress last summer, attended by 2,844 elected representatives. This congress was the result of joint actions by the African National Congress, the South African Indian Congress, the South African Colored People’s Organisation, and the Congress of Democrats (an organization of progressive Europeans).
	The charter describes the basic demands of the people of South Africa in terms of education, guaranteeing normal living conditions, democracy, and freedom.
	Simultaneous with the signature collection movement, there have been significant large-scale actions against some of the Strijdom government's recent persecutory legislation.
	The "Bantu Education Act" is one of the most barbaric legislations in the history of national administration. According to this legislation, teachers teaching in schools for African children must, in addition to all other work, make "Bantu children aware of their status as members of a special community." The purpose of this legislation is to artificially prevent the progress of the African people. This is of course an illusion!
	On the day the new teaching act took effect, there were many women's marches and demonstrations in the Union of South Africa, with the slogan "Down with the Bantu Education Act!" The authorities carried out arrests. However, the struggle continues.
	The "Apartheid Act" stipulates that African residents must be segregated and forced to move to unsanitary residential areas consisting of simple shacks. Africans are often forced to leave their homes. In many districts of the Union of South Africa, there have been multiple large-scale demonstrations protesting this legislation.

	Bechuanaland, Basutoland, Swaziland
	The people's movement in these three territories is constantly expanding and growing. In Basutoland, this movement is manifested in the people's opposition to the administrative zoning changes proposed by the British government last year. At a gathering of the African Congress in Basutoland, pamphlets on these proposals were burned in public. These proposals are criticized mainly because they do not even consider the demand to establish a legislative council in Basutoland.
	In Bechuanaland, the people's movement is being carried out under the slogan of "Let Seretse Khama return home." Seretse Khama is the leader of the Bamangwato tribe. Four years ago, after the government of the Union of South Africa prohibited him from marrying a British woman, the British authorities prohibited him from entering the country. Seretse now lives in London. Repeated attempts to force the Bamangwato tribe to accept another leader have been repeatedly rejected.
	Seretse has become a symbol of the struggle for racial equality and freedom.

	Central Africa
	In 1951, the question of establishing a federation of Northern Rhodesia, Southern Rhodesia, and Nyasaland was raised. A year later, the federation was forcibly established in these three regions, despite the wishes of the Africans, and one of the main reasons for establishing the federation was the struggle of the Africans. The colonialists who ruled and exploited this region began to fear the rapid growth of the African people's national consciousness and their yearning for democracy. The intensified mining of copper in Northern Rhodesia has led to the emergence of a militant and well-organized African proletariat. The development of industry in Southern Rhodesia has also led to the same result. As expected, the establishment of the federation expanded the strict racial laws originally implemented in Southern Rhodesia to Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland. In addition, it can also be foreseen that with the establishment of this larger and more "stable" country, foreign investment will also increase.
	From the moment the federation was established, the struggle of the Africans has also strengthened. Currently, the African trade unions in the copper mining areas are fighting for equal pay for equal work with white workers. In Nyasaland, the people's movement to secede from the federation is becoming increasingly strong.
	It is also very illustrative that some things that would never have caused organized protests if they had happened a few years ago are now causing outbreaks of public dissatisfaction. For example, last year, a white farmer killed an African and was only sentenced to one year in prison, which caused widespread public protests. African leaders and organizations also protested to the Prime Minister. Africans are no longer willing to tolerate Europeans treating them like animals.

	Kenya
	In Kenya, a real war is being waged against the Kikuyu tribe and other races. As reported, within the three years of the "state of emergency," more than 10,000 Africans have been killed in combat alone. Africans themselves claim that 90,000 people have died in the war, in prisons, and from starvation due to migration. According to materials from "The Times," nearly 67,000 Africans have been imprisoned.
	But has the national liberation movement been suppressed? Before answering this question, it must first be emphasized that Africans have no other way out except to wage guerrilla warfare. The "state of emergency" was established by white colonialists who feared that the strength of the "African Trade Unions" and the "Kenya African Union" would become stronger. These African organizations demanded higher wages, improved education systems, land, and democracy. The colonialists drove thousands of Africans into the forests, and then sent troops, police, planes, and tanks after them.
	The land issue is a major issue in Kenya. 30,000 white immigrants (only 3,000 of whom are farmers) occupy half of the country's arable land, even though they only cultivate one-tenth of these lands. 5.5 million Africans cannot obtain suitable land for cultivation and are forced to cultivate on European-owned land or struggle on their own small, barren land. In Kenya, the demand for land has long been raised, and all other demands of the people are linked to this demand.
	Regarding the "state of emergency," it has been declared more than once that this state has been lifted, but it actually still exists.
	Africans have established effective military and administrative organizations in the forests. For more than three years, they have successfully resisted the attacks of 13,000 well-trained troops and thousands of police. Africans have an organization system for conscription, they collect taxes, establish appropriate supply systems, and have hospitals, transportation, intelligence agencies, and local courts. Under the leadership of Prime Minister Dedan Kimathi, the Kenyan parliament was established in the forests. Kenyan newspapers reported that the resistance movement has expanded to some new areas, and some previously uninvolved groups have also joined the movement.
	Due to the unpopularity of the crisis and war in Kenya in Britain, local authorities have had to try to find a political prescription to help resolve the current situation. While throwing the most democratic and beloved African leaders into prison, killing, or exiling them, the British authorities have also lifted the previously announced ban on all political organizations. As a result, the "Kenya African National Congress" was immediately established at a conference in Nairobi attended by 1,000 people. Such conferences were also held in Nyanza and Nakuru provinces. Three days later, the panicked government authorities re-banned the establishment of this conference!
	In order to confuse African public opinion, the British authorities have proposed new proposals to give Africans the right to vote. But this is just a mockery of democracy, because according to the new proposals, the majority of Africans will not be able to vote, while some "reliable" elements can vote three times at a time. These proposals have not received any support from Africans.

		  Nigeria
	The situation in Nigeria is fundamentally different from that in Kenya. Only a small number of white immigrants live here - some administrative officials and merchants. Therefore, unlike Kenya, the land issue is not the main issue in Nigeria. A more general and fundamental issue there is the desire for Nigeria's independence under the leadership of the newly emerging bourgeoisie (at the present stage).
	Nigeria, with its abundant natural resources and 30 million residents, is one of the most heavily exploited territories in Africa. The British administrative authorities are attempting to reach an agreement with the newly emerging local bourgeoisie, according to which Nigeria can be granted superficial independence at an appropriate time, but at the same time, the activities of British monopoly capital on its territory will not be hindered.
	However, even these insignificant concessions cannot be achieved without the mass movement of the people, especially the organized working class movement. Organized workers have repeatedly used strikes, marches, and other political mobilizations to show their demand to end foreign rule.
	In order to stop the national liberation movement, Nigeria was divided into three regions in 1947, each with its own national council. This measure was scheduled to continue for twelve years, but it failed after four years, and a new constitution was adopted in 1951. However, this constitution also went bankrupt after two years, and emergency changes were implemented in 1954. This August, Nigeria will hold a new constitutional drafting conference.
	Now the national liberation movement in Nigeria is led by the bourgeoisie. The working class movement is growing, and the trade unions have quickly recovered after their failure at the end of 1950. There are Marxists in the country, but they are scattered and extremely lacking an organized Marxist party. The colonial authorities are able to take advantage of the division of Nigerian political parties, limiting themselves to allowing only some incomplete autonomy on a regional basis at the constitutional drafting conference. However, even in this case, this is only a delay in the day when the Nigerian people will fight for true independence.

		  Gold Coast
	Although the Prime Minister of the Gold Coast is African, imperialism still rules the country, causing its economy to develop abnormally and preventing the people from breaking free from poverty. Here we see a typical example: imperialism allied with a part of the local bourgeoisie, granting the local certain limited forms of autonomy, so that the other party would assume the obligation: not to hinder their continued exploitation of the country.
	But even this concession is the result of a very powerful and well-organized national liberation movement, which is reflected in the complete victory of the People's Convention Party in the 1951 parliamentary elections. At that time, Kwame Nkrumah, the leader of the People's Convention Party, was still in prison. After his release, the government he led apparently made concessions to imperialism. Now the struggle for independence is being carried out by some individuals and groups - proletarian, peasant, and bourgeois groups - whose interests are opposed to those of the imperialists. The United Opposition, although diverse in its composition, is a considerable force.

		  Sierra Leone
	In recent months, in the small territory of Sierra Leone, located on the west coast of Africa, the people's movement has mainly taken the form of demonstrations protesting the non-payment of certain taxes. Thousands of people petitioned the Governor, arousing his anger. Police shot at demonstrators, killing seventeen people and injuring many. Under the pressure of the people, the tax increase was suspended and certain taxes were allowed to be reviewed.

			Uganda
	After being forced to live abroad for two years, the Kabaka of Uganda (the title of the Ugandan king) recently returned home. More than 100,000 people welcomed him. An arch in the Ugandan National Assembly read "We demand immediate autonomy!" To this, "The Times" admitted: "Africa is boiling, and any event in Uganda, located between Kenya and Sudan, will affect the rest of Africa."
	At that time, the people themselves punished the tribal leaders who cooperated with the British ruling group when the Kabaka was away. Their livestock was confiscated, their houses were burned, and in some cases, some of them were forced to give up power. Marches and demonstrations were held in many parts of the country, with thousands of Africans participating.

	Conclusion
	These are some of the most important manifestations of the rising African national liberation movement. This movement is amazing in its diversity of forms. But what is surprising first of all is that these movements almost all have a common feature: it is now difficult to find a region on the African continent, whether it is a pastoral area, an agricultural area, or an industrial area, that has not been involved in the national liberation movement. This is much bigger than imperialism expected. Moreover, from a long-term perspective, this movement is unstoppable.
	The Soviet Union has always supported and sympathized with the struggles of the people of African countries. Therefore, millions of people in Africa consider the Soviet Union to be their friend and regard the Soviet Union as an example of what can be achieved after the people control their own destiny. At the same time, the people of African countries are turning their eyes to the democratic movements in capitalist countries and reasonably expect their assistance, because the struggle of the people of African countries and the struggle of the working class and all progressive forces in capitalist countries for peace, true democracy, and socialism are the same struggle.
	The people of South Africa have declared the slogan: "Africa should gain freedom in the lives of this generation!" We also repeat this slogan.

    非洲的民族解放运动
    英国  德莱克·卡东
    非洲是一个辽阔的大陆。非洲各族人民操着七百种语言，他们是各种文化的代表。非洲有丰富的、大半未经利用的自然资源。但是，虽然非洲有无尽的富藏，饥饿仍然是一种寻常的现象。千百万人除一身蔽体的破烂衣衫以外一无所有。
    非洲很早以来就是老牌帝国主义国家——英国、法国、比利时、葡萄牙、西班牙——掠夺的一块肥肉。在亚洲大部分地区解放以后，对于资本主义国家说来，非洲作为利润的来源，廉价的原料产地以及重要的战略基地，它的意义是无比地提高了。非洲不仅有各种有益矿藏，发展农业的巨大潜力和廉价的劳动力，并且变成了帝国主义国家为反对社会主义世界而建立的进攻基地锁链的南部堡垒。英属东非有巨大的军火库。摩洛哥有最大的美国海外空军基地，利比亚有一个巨大的英美基地。南非联邦的工业可以很快地转入军火生产。这里出产战略原料：铜、铬、金刚石、金、铁矿、锰、锡、铀……
    由此可见，对帝国主义国家以至整个资本主义世界说来，非洲的意义是难以估量的。
    毫无疑问，非洲正在伸起腰来。差不多整个大陆都已开始沸腾起来了。这是人类历史上最伟大的事件之一，它对非洲人以及其他各洲人民都有不可估量的意义。
    著名的美国记者和作家约翰·根室在他关于非洲的一本书中写道：“非洲的大部分很像战前的亚洲——渴望解放的亚洲。而这是完全合乎规律的。无论人们的肤色如何，都不能剥夺他们渴望自由的权利。非洲毕竟是非洲人的大陆。”
    有名的学者、美国黑人杜布瓦博士强调说：“西方既已失掉掠夺亚洲的可能，现在就把注意力转向那个曾被工业革命打开的最富饶的黄金国，这就是新非洲，二十世纪的非洲……但是，由于对悲惨的劳动的日益加重的、越来越有利的剥削，使整个非洲现在处在水深火热之中……目前非洲拥有全世界金刚石开采量的98％，钴的80％，龙舌兰产量的75％，棕榈油的70％，可可和巧克力的70％，采金量的60％，磷的35％，铬和锰的30％，铜的20％，咖啡产量的15％。而且必须记住，这个大陆的富藏还只是开始利用。非洲是资本主义世界所垂涎的诱人的掠夺对象。但是，这不能不引起反抗，而在今天，从突尼斯到开普敦，整个非洲都燃烧起来了。”
          历史情况
    到十九世纪九十年代中期，非洲实际上已经被帝国主义列强瓜分完毕，同时，除了个别的例外，非洲人的抵抗已被用残酷的战争镇压下去。但是直到有了铁路以后，对大陆的天然富源的开发才真正开始。首先是南部的金、金刚石和中部的铜矿的开采，以及东部和西部的各种农业生产。白种殖民者大量移民到非洲南部、东部和中部，这些地区气候比较温和，没有毒蝇肆虐。非洲西部有句俗话：“毒蝇是我们的士兵，它们不放白人到我们这里来。”
    非洲无产阶级在矿山和轻工业企业的出现，是非洲经济开发的必然结果。为了满足日益增多的白种居民的需要，轻工业在南部迅速发展起来。同时这也促成了非洲社会的部落制度的瓦解。在西部出现了为数众多的小农场主和农业工人。非洲人开始受到有限的，为操使机床、驾驶汽车、完成基本的社会生产工作所必需的教育。在那些白种居民人数不多的地区，他们受到比较广泛的教育，为的是培养非洲人的官吏。
    本地资产阶级就是这样产生的。但是，这种情况只发生在几个国家。
    例如在怯尼亚，白种人很多，对非洲人发展的障碍是有意制造出来的，直到现在那里还没有能起作用的本地资产阶级。而另一方面，在黄金海岸（西非）却有显赫的本地资产阶级，帝国主义者是很愿意同他们合作的。在南非联邦，斯揣敦法西斯政府企图借助臭名昭彰的班图族“教育”法案扭转历史车轮。这个法案限制非洲人受教育的范围，严格规定只能得到仅为体力劳动所必需的最低限度的知识。
    当然，民族解放运动的性质，它的力量和成熟性，在颇大程度上是由上述各种情况决定的。
    第二次世界大战以后，非洲的民族解放运动加强了。千百万非洲人在粉碎法西斯主义方面起了显著作用。他们懂得，这是反对强暴、争取自由的战争，并且很快就得出结论：非洲人也有自由的权利。到战争结束时，非洲出现了完全新的情绪。对于千百万人说来，自由、民主和民族独立等概念，已经是亲切而现实的了。许多年来对于受教育和改善物质状况的渴望，在他们的意识中开始同更广泛的要求联系起来。1945年以后在整个大陆兴起的政治组织和工会组织，就反映了这种情绪。
    1942年尼日利亚铁路工人的罢工，1944年尼日利亚和喀麦隆国民议会的成立，怯尼亚的政治积极化——所有这些都是还在战争时期就已出现的伟大觉醒的初步征象。1945年发生了乌干达的大罢工和示威游行，以及尼日利亚史无先例的总罢工。1946年，南非有六万名金矿工人举行了罢工，怯尼亚的非洲人联盟变成了一个群众性的组织，民主同盟在法属西非成立了，非洲的各部分还发生了其他许多重大事件。
    这还只是开始。非洲的民族解放运动在一天比一天扩大和成熟起来。它在法属北非的三个国家——摩洛哥、突尼斯和阿尔及利亚——达到了特别高的水平。在这个时期内出现了四个新的独立国家——利比亚、苏丹、摩洛哥和突尼斯。最后，万隆会议有力地推动了非洲民族解放运动的继续发展。
    谈谈几个最重要的和有典型意义的国家的民族解放运动，将是有益的。首先必须强调说明，消息（我说的可靠消息）非常贫乏。带有群众性的重大事件，常常是整月整月地无声无息。可是，非洲的民族运动是如此波澜壮阔，要完全向世人掩盖它的真象已经是办不到的了。
          南非联邦
    目前，最重要的群众性行动是在三个方面发展：反对种族歧视的立法—班图族教育法案的斗争，反对种族隔离法案以及为“自由宪章”征求一百万人签名的运动。
    这个运动之所以特别重要，是因为它最明显地反映了国内一切进步因素的日益加强的团结，以及非洲人和印度人在反对种族歧视、争取民主斗争中的团结。这个宪章是在去年夏天的南非人民代表大会上通过的，参加这次大会的有二千八百四十四名被推选出来的代表。这次代表大会是非洲人国民大会、南非印度人大会、南非有色人组织和民主人士大会（进步的欧洲人的组织）联合行动的结果。
    宪章叙述了南非各族人民在教育、保证正常生活条件、民主和自由方面的基本要求。
    在征集签名运动的同时，还进行了反对斯揣敦政府最近的一些迫害性立法的有重要意义的大规模行动。
    “班图族教育法案”是国家管理史上最野蛮的立法之一。按照这项立法，在为非洲儿童设的学校中教书的教员除了一切其他工作以外，还要使“班图族的儿童们认识到他们作为一个特别社团的成员所处的地位”。这个立法所追求的目的是：用人为的手段阻止非洲各国人民的进步。这当然是一种幻想！
    在新的教学法案生效的那一天，在南非联邦曾发生了许多起妇女游行示威，游行者的口号是“打倒班图族教育法案！”当局曾进行了逮捕。但是，斗争仍在继续。
    “种族隔离法案”规定要把非洲居民隔离开来，这些居民被迫移居到不卫生的、由简陋的茅舍组成的居住区里去。非洲人经常被迫离开自己的家园。在南非联邦的很多区里发生了抗议这项立法的多次大规模游行示威。
    贝专纳、巴苏陀兰、斯威士兰
    在这三个领地中人民的运动正在不断地扩大和增长。在巴苏陀兰，这个运动表现为人民反对英国政府去年所提的行政区划的变更。在巴苏陀兰的非洲人大会集会上，这些建议的小册子曾被当众焚毁。这些建议之所以受到责难，主要是因为它们甚至不考虑在巴苏陀兰建立立法会议的要求。
    在贝专纳，人民运动是在“让塞列兹·哈马回国”的口号下开展起来的。塞列兹·哈马是巴曼格瓦特族的领袖。四年前，当南非联邦政府禁止他同英国人结婚以后，英国当局就禁止他入境。现在塞列兹住在伦敦。强使巴曼格瓦特族接受另外一个领袖的屡次尝试都不断遭到拒绝。
    塞列兹成了为争取种族平等和自由而斗争的标志。
    中非
    1951年，提出了建立北罗得西亚、南罗得西亚和尼亚萨兰联邦的问题。一年以后，不顾非洲人的意愿，在这三个地区强行建立了联邦，而建立联邦的主要原因之一就是非洲人的斗争。统治并剥削这个地区的殖民主义者开始害怕非洲人民族自觉的迅速增长和他们对民主的向往。北罗得西亚铜矿的加紧开采，促成了富于战斗性的、组织良好的非洲无产阶级的出现。南罗得西亚工业的发展也导致了同样的结果。正如所预料，联邦的建立，使原来在南罗得西亚实行的那些严格的种族法扩大到了北罗得西亚和尼亚萨兰。此外，还可以预料到，随着这个范围比较大和比较“稳定”的国家的建立，外国的投资也将增多起来。
    从建立联邦的时刻起，非洲人的斗争也加强了。目前铜矿区的非洲人工会正在为争取同白种工人同工同酬而斗争。在尼亚萨兰，争取脱离联邦的人民运动越来越强烈起来。
    有一些事，倘在几年以前发生绝不会引起有组织的抗议，而现在却引起了公众不满的爆发，这也很具有说明性。例如在去年，一个白种人的农场主打死了一个非洲人，只被判了一年徒刑，公众为此曾纷纷提出抗议。非洲人的领袖和组织也向总理提出抗议。非洲人已不愿再容忍欧洲人把他们当畜牲看待。
    怯尼亚
    在怯尼亚正在进行着对吉库犹族以及其他种族的真正的战争。正如所报道的，在“紧急状态”的三年内，仅在战斗中被打死的非洲人就在一万名以上。非洲人自己宣称，死于战争以及死于监狱和因迁移而饿死的，已达九万人。根据“泰晤士报”的材料，被囚禁的非洲人近六万七千名。
    但是，民族解放运动是否被镇压下去了呢？在回答这个问题前必须首先强调指出，除了进行游击战以外，非洲人并没有其他出路。“紧急状态”是白种殖民主义者所建立的，他们害怕“非洲人工会”和“怯尼亚非洲人联盟”的力量会强大起来。这些非洲人组织要求提高工资、改进教育制度、土地和民主制度。殖民主义者把成千的非洲人驱入森林，接着还在他们后面派去了军队、警察、飞机和坦克。
    土地问题是怯尼亚的一个主要问题。三万名白种移民（他们中只有三千人务农）占据了这个国家耕地的一半，虽则他们耕种的只有这些土地的十分之一。五百五十万非洲人得不到适于耕种的土地，而被迫在属于欧洲人的土地上耕作，或者在自己的一小片贫瘠的土地上拼命耕作。在怯尼亚，对土地的要求早已提出，而人民的所有其他要求都是同这个要求联系着的。
    关于“紧急状态”曾经不止一次地声明说，这种状态已经撤消，但是它实际上却仍然存在着。
    非洲人在森林中建立了有效的军事和行政组织。三年多来，他们胜利地抵抗住了一万三千名受过良好训练的军队和数千名警察的进攻。非洲人拥有一个征兵的组织系统，他们征税，建立了适当的供应系统，并有医院、运输、情报处和地方法庭。在总理台丹·基马悌的领导下，在森林中建立了怯尼亚的国会。怯尼亚的报纸报道说，抵抗运动扩大到了一些新的地区，一些前此未卷入的集团也加入了这个运动。
    由于怯尼亚所发生的危机和战争在英国的不得人心，地方当局不得不设法寻觅有助于解决目前局势的一种政治药方。英国当局一方面把最民主和最受人爱戴的非洲领袖投入狱中、杀死或流放，同时又撤消了以前所公布的对一切政治组织的禁令。于是在内罗毕的有一千人参加的大会上立刻成立了“怯尼亚非洲人国民大会”。在尼雅萨和纳库鲁省也举行了这样的大会。三天以后，惊慌失措的政府当局又重新禁止这个大会的成立！
    英国当局为了迷惑非洲的社会舆论，提出了给非洲人以选举权的新建议。但是这不过是对民主的一种嘲弄而已，因为按照新的建议，大多数的非洲人都得不到投票权，而一些“可靠”分子却可以一次投三张票。这些建议没有得到非洲人的任何支持。
            尼日利亚
    尼日利亚的情况根本不同于怯尼亚。这里只居住着不多的白种移民——一些行政机关的官吏和商人。因此，不像怯尼亚，土地问题不是尼日利亚的主要问题。那里一个更普遍的基本问题是：在新生的资产阶级的领导下（在现阶段）对尼日利亚的独立的渴望。
    拥有丰富的自然资源和三千万居民的尼日利亚是非洲受剥削最厉害的领地之一。英国行政当局企图同当地新生的资产阶级达成协议，根据这个协议在适当的时候可以赋予尼日利亚表面上的独立性，但同时不使英国垄断资本在它领土上的活动受到障碍。
    但是，如果不是人民群众运动，首先是有组织的工人阶级运动，甚至于这些微不足道的让步也是不能达到的。有组织的工人不止一次地用罢工、游行和其他政治发动来表明他们要求结束外国的统治。
    为了制止民族解放运动，在1947年把尼日利亚分为三个区域，每一个区域都有自己的国民会议。预定这一措施要继续十二年，但是，这个措施过了四年就失败了，1951年采用了新宪法。但是，这个宪法过了两年也破产了，在1954年实行了紧急的改变。今年8月，尼日利亚要举行新的制定宪法的代表会议。
    现在尼日利亚的民族解放运动是由资产阶级领导的。工人阶级运动在增长，而工会在1950年底失败以后，已经很快地恢复过来。国内有马克思主义者，但是他们是分散的，极其感到缺少一个有组织的马克思主义政党。殖民地当局能够利用尼日利亚各政党的分散，局限于在制宪会议上只允许在地区性的基础上给予某种残缺不全的自治。然而，即使是在这样情况下，这也只是对尼日利亚人民争取真正独立的日子的某些延迟。
          黄金海岸
    尽管黄金海岸的总理是非洲人，但是帝国主义仍然统治着这个国家，使它的经济畸形发展，并且不让人民挣脱贫困。这里我们看到这样一个典型：帝国主义同当地的一部分资产阶级结盟，赋予当地某些有限制的自治形式，以便使对方承担义务：不来阻挠它们继续剥削这个国家。
    但是，即使是这种让步，也是非常有力，而且组织良好的民族解放运动的结果，这个运动在1951年议会选举的人民大会党的彻底胜利上反映出来。当时，人民大会党的领袖恩克鲁玛还在监狱里。在获释以后，他领导的政府显然是对帝国主义让步了。现在争取独立的斗争是由一些个别人士和团体——无产阶级的、农民的和资产阶级的团体——来进行，他们的利益是同帝国主义者的利益相对立的。联合反对派，虽然按其成份说是各种各样的，但却是一个不小的力量。
          塞拉勒窝内
    在最近几个月中，位于非洲西部海岸的塞拉勒窝内的不大领土上，人民的运动主要是采取了一种抗缴某些捐税的示威性质。几千人向总督请愿，引起他的愤怒。警察射击示威者，十七个人死亡，许多人受伤。在人民的压力下，曾停止提高并允许审查某些捐税。
            乌干达
    在迫不得已侨居国外两年以后，乌干达的卡巴卡（乌干达土王的衔名）不久以前回国了。有十万以上的人欢迎他。在乌干达国民议会的一个凯旋门上写着“我们要求立刻自治！”对此，“泰晤士报”承认：“非洲在沸腾，位于怯尼亚和苏丹之间的乌干达的任何一个事件，都会对整个非洲的其余部分发生影响。”
    就在那个时候，人民自己惩办了那些当卡巴卡不在时同英国统治集团合作的部落领袖。没收了他们的牲畜，烧光了他们的房子，而在某些情况下还逼着他们中的一部分人放弃政权。在国内很多地区举行了游行示威，有几千名非洲人参加。
    结论
    这就是非洲民族解放运动高涨的某些最重要的表现。这种运动以它的形式的多种多样性而使人惊讶。但是，首先使人惊奇的是这些运动几乎都具有一个共同特点：现在在非洲大陆不论是畜牧区、农业区或工业区，很难找到一个没有被卷入到民族解放运动中来的地区。这比帝国主义所意料的大得多。而且，从远景来看，这个运动是不可遏止的。
    苏联一贯支持和同情非洲各国人民斗争，因此，非洲千百万人民认为苏联是自己的朋友，并且把苏联看做是当人民掌握了自己的命运之后所能得到的成就的范例。同时，非洲各国人民正在把自己的视线转向资本主义国家的民主运动，并十分合理地期待着它们的援助，因为非洲各国人民的斗争，和资本主义国家的工人阶级和一切进步力量争取和平、真正民主和社会主义的斗争，乃是同一个斗争。
    南非各国人民宣布了这样一个口号：“非洲应当在这一代人的生活中获得自由！”我们也重复这个口号。
