Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 9th September: Shanxi province's more than 50 million mu of autumn crops, including grain, cotton, and oil-bearing crops, are expected to have a bumper harvest. According to a recent inspection by the Shanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture, the average yield of grain crops across the province is expected to reach over 145 jin per mu (including the yield of summer wheat), an increase of 23.6% compared to last year. The 5.57 million mu of cotton is expected to produce an average of 44 jin of ginned cotton per mu, an increase of 15.5% compared to last year. The total yield of oil crops such as peanuts and sunflowers is also expected to increase compared to previous years.

Some of Shanxi province's autumn crops suffered continuous attacks from natural disasters such as hail, wind, and floods during July and August. Agricultural cooperative members in various regions waged a tenacious struggle against these natural disasters. Now, except for some areas that were severely affected, where farmers are replanting and changing to late-autumn crops, the remaining areas are showing signs of a bumper harvest. The main grain crop, sorghum, has generally turned red, with full grains. Corn cobs are large and dense, and most have reached the dough stage. Millet ears have also turned yellow. As the major autumn crops in the north and central regions are about to be harvested, the cotton in the Jinan Basin, the main cotton-producing area, is in full bloom. White cotton fibers are blossoming across the mountains and fields, and groups of farmers are beginning to go to the fields to pick new cotton.

    山西粮棉油料丰收在望
    晋南盆地棉花盛开成群农妇开始摘新棉
    新华社太原9日电　山西省五千多万亩粮食、棉花和油料等秋季作物可望丰收。据山西省农业厅最近检查后估计，全省粮食作物每亩平均产量可达到一百四十五斤以上（包括夏季小麦的产量），比去年增产23.6％。五百五十七万亩棉花，平均每亩可产皮棉四十四斤，比去年增加15.5％。花生、向日葵等油料作物的总产量也可比往年增加。
    山西省的部分秋季作物，在七、八月间曾连续遭受雹、风、洪水等自然灾害的袭击，各地农业社社员们和自然灾害进行了顽强的斗争。现在，除部分地区遭灾较重，农民们正在补种和改种晚秋作物以外，其余地区都呈现出丰收景象。主要粮食作物高粱已普遍晒红米，颗粒饱满。玉米穗大粒密，大部已定浆。谷子穗儿也已发黄。当北部、中部大秋作物即将收割的时候，主要产棉区晋南盆地的棉花已经盛开。漫山遍野吐露出白皑皑的棉絮，成群农妇开始下地采摘新棉。
