Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 12th – Trial work on establishing advanced co-ops in every township in Sichuan Province has basically concluded in most areas, and a few areas have begun the work of upgrading from elementary to advanced co-ops. Yibin Prefecture has developed relatively quickly, with the number of peasant households joining advanced co-ops accounting for over 49% of the total number of peasant households. Currently, there are more than 6,500 advanced co-ops in the province, with peasant households joining accounting for 12% of the province's total number of peasant households.

After Sichuan Province basically achieved elementary forms of cooperativization in January of this year, the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party actively led the elementary co-ops in doing a good job in spring plowing and production, and carried out rectification and consolidation work on the elementary co-ops through production, creating conditions for upgrading to advanced co-ops. After June, activities to upgrade to advanced co-ops began in various places. Various localities trained more than 100,000 co-op cadres, key personnel, and accountants, taking the county as the unit, and expanded the scope of elementary co-ops and organized joint elementary co-ops according to the needs of running advanced co-ops. According to incomplete statistics, more than 60,000 joint co-ops were organized in the province.

At present, the vast majority of co-op members in Sichuan Province are demanding to upgrade to advanced co-ops, while a small number of co-op members still have concerns. Most of the elementary co-ops that want to transfer to advanced co-ops have established advanced co-op establishment committees. It is expected that the work of upgrading to advanced co-ops will be fully launched throughout the province in late September and early October, and advanced forms of agricultural cooperativization can be achieved throughout the province before the end of this year.

    四川开始进行转社工作
    年底前全省可实现高级合作化
    新华社成都12日电　四川省每乡试办高级社工作在大部分地区已经基本结束，少数地区开展了由初级社升高级社工作。宜宾专区发展较快，加入高级社的农户约占农户的49％以上。目前，全省现有高级社六千五百多个，入社农户占全省农户总数12％。
    今年1月，四川省基本上实现初级形式的合作化后，中共四川省委积极领导初级社搞好春耕生产，并通过生产对初级社进行整顿和巩固工作，为升高级社创造条件。6月以后，各地开始了升高级社的活动。各地以县为单位训练了十万多办社干部、骨干和会计，并且根据办高级社的需要，扩大了初级社的范围，组织了初级社的联社，据不完全统计，全省就组织了六万多个联社。
    现在，四川省绝大多数社员都要求升高级社，少数社员还有顾虑。要求转高级社的初级社，大部分成立了建立高级社委员会。预计，全省在9月下旬和10月初，升高级社工作就能全面展开，到今年年前全省就可以实现高级形式的农业合作化。
