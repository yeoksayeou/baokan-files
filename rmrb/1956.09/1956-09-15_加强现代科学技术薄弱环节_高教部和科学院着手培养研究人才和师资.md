Xinhua News Agency Report: To strengthen the weak links in modern science and technology, the Ministry of Higher Education and the Chinese Academy of Sciences are taking active measures to cultivate university students and technical personnel to become scientific research talent and university teachers in areas such as semiconductor physics, computer technology, production process automation, and engineering mechanics.

A semiconductor physics specialization jointly established by five universities—Peking University, Northeast People's University, Xiamen University, Fudan University, and Nanjing University—began classes at Peking University on September 6. This marks the beginning of large-scale cultivation of specialized talent in semiconductor physics. This year's new students were all drawn from the third-year physics departments of various comprehensive universities. Scientists engaged in semiconductor physics research, such as Huang Kun, Hong Chaosheng, and Xie Xide, will teach relevant courses for this specialization.

The computer technology training class, comprising electronic computers and computational mathematics, will cultivate the first batch of specialized talent in computer technology for the country. The two parts will begin classes in mid-September and early October, respectively. Some graduating students in mathematics and radio engineering from some universities, teachers and third-year students in mathematics and radio engineering from related schools, and related technical personnel from business departments and the Chinese Academy of Sciences will become students in this training class.

The engineering mechanics research class and the production process automation training class are being actively prepared.

    加强现代科学技术薄弱环节
    高教部和科学院着手培养研究人才和师资
    新华社讯一批大学生和技术人员将要被培养成为半导体物理、计算技术、生产过程自动化、工程力学等方面的科学研究人才和高等学校的师资。这是高等教育部、中国科学院为加强现代科学技术的薄弱环节所采取的一项积极措施。
    由北京大学、东北人民大学、厦门大学、复旦大学和南京大学五校联合开设的一个半导体物理专门化，9月6日已经在北京大学开课。这是成批培养半导体物理专门人才的开始。今年的新生都是各综合大学物理系三年级抽调来的。研究半导体物理的科学家黄昆、洪朝生、谢希德等人都要讲授这个专门化有关课程。
    计算技术进修班包括电子计算机和计算数学两个部分，将为国家培养第一批计算技术的专门人才。两个部分将分别在9月中旬和10月初开学。一部分高等学校数学和无线电专业的应届毕业生，有关学校数学和无线电专业的教师和三年级学生，业务部门和中国科学院的有关技术人员即将成为这个进修班的学员。
    工程力学研究班和生产过程自动化进修班正在积极筹备中。
