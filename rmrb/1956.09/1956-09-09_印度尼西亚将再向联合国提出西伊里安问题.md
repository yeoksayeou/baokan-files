Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 8th - It was learned from authoritative sources by the Indonesian News Agency yesterday that it is now certain that Indonesia will once again raise the West Irian issue at the United Nations General Assembly.

It is reported that these individuals said that, because Indonesia has unilaterally abolished the Round Table Conference Agreement signed with the Netherlands in 1949, Indonesia will raise its demand for the recovery of this territory in accordance with Indonesia's Declaration of Independence of 1945.

    印度尼西亚将再向联合国提出西伊里安问题
    新华社雅加达8日电　据印度尼西亚新闻社昨天从权威方面获悉，现在可以肯定，印度尼西亚将再一次向联合国大会提出西伊里安问题。
    据报道，这些人士说，由于印度尼西亚已经单方面地废除了1949年同荷兰签订的圆桌会议协定，印度尼西亚将根据1945年印度尼西亚的独立宣言来提出收回这块领土的要求。
