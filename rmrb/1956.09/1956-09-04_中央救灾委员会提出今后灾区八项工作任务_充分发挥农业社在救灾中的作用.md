Xinhua News Agency, September 3rd: The head of the Central Disaster Relief Committee told our reporter that although this year's disaster situation is serious, it is lighter than in 1954. At the same time, there are more favorable conditions for overcoming disasters this year.

Favorable Conditions for Overcoming Disasters

This year, disaster areas have suffered heavy losses, and grain and cotton production have been reduced to varying degrees. However, this year, crops in most non-disaster areas are growing well, and increased production is expected. It is estimated that the total grain output of the country can still increase compared with last year. In particular, the strong support from the state to the disaster areas and the positive role played by agricultural producers' cooperatives in the fight against disasters have provided the people in the disaster areas with extremely favorable conditions for overcoming the disaster.

The person in charge said that the CPC Central Committee and the State Council are extremely concerned about the people in the disaster areas. In early August, the State Council promptly issued instructions requiring all localities to do a good job in rescue and follow-up work. At the same time, the various demands raised by the disaster-stricken areas were resolved as quickly as possible within the greatest possible limits.

Since August, the State Council has allocated a total of 170.3 million yuan in relief funds. If the relief funds allocated in the first half of the year are included, the total amount of relief funds alone is 220.5 million yuan. At the same time, an additional 150 million yuan in agricultural loans was allocated to the disaster areas. In addition, 720 million catties of grain, more than 40,000 tons of chemical fertilizers, and more than 5,000 tons of pesticides were transferred from various provinces to support the disaster areas. Timber, steel, cement and other building materials needed in the disaster areas were fully met and given priority as much as possible. The state is also preparing to continue to transport grain, fertilizer and building materials. During flood control and rescue of disaster victims, the central government repeatedly sent a large number of planes to villages in Hebei, Henan, and Shandong provinces where transportation was cut off, airdropping a large number of rubber boats, life jackets, tires, and grain to rescue disaster victims trapped by the floods. At the same time, the State Council organized six working groups to go to the affected provinces to understand the situation and assist in the work.

The person in charge said: The follow-up work in the disaster-stricken areas is also being actively carried out in various places to help the disaster victims rebuild their homes and restore production. The houses blown down by the wind in Jiangsu Province have been basically repaired, and 20-30% of the houses that were blown down have also been repaired. More than half of the houses that collapsed in Anhui Province have been repaired. In Anyang Prefecture, Henan Province, which was the most severely affected by the disaster, more than 230,000 of the 250,000 disaster victims who had been moved out have returned to their hometowns for production. The work of replanting late autumn crops and developing sideline production in various disaster areas is also being actively carried out.

The person in charge went on to say that this year's disaster is serious. But from a national perspective, it is not as serious as the 1954 flood; in some local areas, such as Hebei, Henan, Heilongjiang and other provinces, it is more serious than in 1954. At the same time, there are many differences between this year's disaster situation and the disaster situation in 1954: First, this year, the main problem was breaches and overflows of medium-sized and small rivers. There were no problems with major rivers such as the Yangtze River and the Huai River, so there were fewer casualties to people and livestock and fewer houses collapsed than in 1954; Second, this year, the main areas affected were north of the Huai River, with less reduction in rice production, and more reduction in crops such as wheat, miscellaneous grains, and cotton than in 1954; Third, this year's floods came earlier, and many areas suffered from both the wheat and autumn seasons, while the disasters in 1954 occurred later, and the masses harvested a season of wheat. Therefore, the difficulties of the masses in these areas are greater than in 1954; Fourth, this year, rural areas have basically achieved cooperativization, and the disaster resistance force has been greatly enhanced compared with 1954. In addition, the water conservancy construction over the years has made great achievements. This is the most important factor in overcoming disasters.

The Status of this Year's Disaster Situation

The person in charge then analyzed the situation of this year's disaster in our country. He said: In late May and early June, floods occurred in Anhui, Henan, and Jiangsu provinces in the Huai River Basin, and summer-harvested crops such as wheat suffered heavy losses. In early August, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and Anhui provinces were hit by strong typhoons. A total of 62 counties and cities in Zhejiang Province suffered typhoon disasters, of which 25 counties and cities were more severely affected. In the coastal areas of Jiangsu Province and the areas south of the Huai River in Anhui Province, many houses collapsed, people and livestock were killed or injured, and crops were damaged by the wind. At the same time as the typhoon struck, extraordinarily large floods occurred in Hebei, Henan, Heilongjiang, Jilin and other provinces, and serious waterlogging disasters occurred in riverside and low-lying areas. Hebei Province was more severely affected, with a disaster area of more than 42 million mu. At the same time, severe droughts occurred in some areas of Hunan, Fujian, Jiangxi and other provinces.

The Rescue Work is Satisfactory

The person in charge expressed great satisfaction with this year's rescue work in various disaster-stricken areas. The person in charge said that when the disaster came, under the unified leadership of the Party and the government, relying on the people who have experience in fighting against disasters, and relying on the strong collective strength of the agricultural cooperatives, all localities actively launched disaster resistance and rescue activities, greatly reducing the harm of various disasters. Jiangsu Province carried out reinforcement projects on the dikes along the coast, along the river, and along the lake in advance. When the typhoon came, they strengthened their defense, so that no breaches occurred in the dikes throughout the province. Shanghai suffered very little loss due to good preparation. Before and during the typhoon, the vast agricultural cooperatives in Anhui Province actively organized their members to harvest 2.34 million mu of early rice. Many places also took wind prevention measures such as fencing, bundling, soil accumulation, and soil cultivation, so that crops suffered less damage. After the flood situation began to become tense, Hebei, Henan, Heilongjiang, Jilin and other provinces seized the time to prevent floods and carry out rescue operations. Millions of flood prevention personnel were working day and night to "raise the dikes as the water rises" and "dredge the water back to the channels." The 300,000 flood prevention personnel in Harbin persisted in their struggle and finally defeated the flood, ensuring the safety of the entire city. People who were hit by disasters were taken care of in many ways in various places. Those who did not have food were given emergency relief, those whose houses collapsed were helped to repair them, those who were sick or injured were treated, and the dead were buried, so that the various difficulties in the lives of the disaster victims were initially resolved.

The person in charge said that in the process of disaster relief, the People's Liberation Army and the people in non-disaster areas showed great enthusiasm to support the people in the disaster areas. Many dikes were completely guarded by the army, and some dangerous sections were rescued by the army. As for the people in the non-disaster areas near the disaster areas, they also organized the masses, supplied materials to the disaster areas, and resettled the disaster victims. This spirit is moving.

When the reporter asked about the current disaster situation, the person in charge said that the flood season has not yet passed. It is estimated that disasters such as rain, snow, frost, and freezing may still occur. The weather in northern Jiangsu and other places has been阴凉 (yin liang - cold and shady) these days, which is very unfavorable to crop growth. On the evening of the 3rd, the center of the typhoon landed near Fuzhou, Fujian again. Therefore, we must be vigilant, continue to fight against disasters, prevent new disasters, and further improve disaster relief work.

Future Tasks for Disaster Areas

Regarding the future tasks in the disaster areas, the person in charge pointed out that the main thing is to rely on and mobilize the masses to carry out the production self-rescue movement. That is:

1.  Give full play to the role of agricultural cooperatives in production disaster relief. All work unrelated to production and disaster relief should be stopped or slowed down, and concentrate all efforts to lead the people in the disaster areas to overcome natural disasters.

2.  Production disaster relief is both a blitz-like task and a regular task. It is a common task for relevant departments in disaster areas to both produce and provide relief. Every department should assume certain responsibilities. It is best for all localities to set up special production disaster relief agencies to be responsible for regular work, and at the same time formulate a comprehensive plan for production disaster relief for the entire disaster period.

3.  Quickly lead agricultural cooperatives to carry out production in disaster areas. As long as the production season can be caught up, we should try to replant and re-cultivate crops. Plant whatever we can plant, and do not give up any possible opportunities. The biggest problem in the disaster area is to rush to plant wheat. All localities must make every effort to drain water and plant wheat. Protecting draught animals is a major issue. All localities must vigorously solve the problem of feed supply, or move some draught animals to non-disaster areas for foster care, and be sure to save the draught animals. Sideline production is an important reliance for disaster victims to survive the famine. It should be vigorously carried out, and we must start early and act quickly. Sideline production in disaster areas is different from that in non-disaster areas. We should focus on developing sideline production with small investment and quick returns.

4.  Distribute and use relief funds rationally and effectively. These funds should be used well to help disaster victims restore their homes, settle the lives of the disaster-stricken people as soon as possible, and support them to carry out production and survive the entire disaster period.

5.  Do a good job in economic work in disaster areas. Commercial, supply and marketing cooperatives, banks and other economic departments in the affected provinces, on the one hand, must adapt to the supply and demand situation in the rural areas after the disaster, do a good job in supply work, and ensure that the necessities needed by the disaster victims in their lives and production are supplied without shortage. On the other hand, we must adapt to the needs of disaster victims for production self-rescue, do a good job in product procurement and open up sales channels.

6.  Use the method of work-for-relief to organize disaster victims to participate in water conservancy and transportation construction projects.

7.  Attach importance to and strengthen medical and health work in disaster areas. It is necessary to quickly organize Chinese and Western medical personnel to go to the disaster areas to carry out fixed or mobile medical work. At the same time, we must help the masses to clean up the environment and prevent epidemics.

8.  Quickly stop the phenomenon of disaster victims fleeing famine. All localities must take effective measures to stop this situation. For the few who do have relatives and friends to rely on and can support themselves, they should also be allowed to seek refuge with relatives and friends; those who have already fled should be helped to solve their temporary difficulties or sent back to their hometowns.

    中央救灾委员会提出今后灾区八项工作任务
    充分发挥农业社在救灾中的作用
　　新华社3日讯　中央救灾委员会负责人对本社记者说，今年灾情虽然严重，但比1954年要轻一些，同时，今年战胜灾害的有利条件要多。
    战胜灾荒的有利条件
　　今年灾区损失较重，粮食、棉花受到不同程度的减产，但是今年广大非灾区农作物生长都很好，增产有望，估计全国的粮食总产量仍能比去年增加。特别是国家对灾区的大力支援，农业生产合作社在抗灾中所起的积极作用，使灾区人民具备了战胜灾荒极为有利的条件。
　　负责人说，中共中央和国务院对灾区人民极为关怀。8月初，国务院及时发出指示，要求各地做好抢救及善后工作。同时，对遭灾地区提出来的各项要求，都在最大可能限度内，以最快的时间给予解决。
　　国务院8月以来共拨救济款一亿七千零三十万元。如果把上半年拨出的救济款包括在内，仅救济款一项共计有两亿二千零五十万元。同时还增拨灾区农贷一亿五千万元。除此之外，还从各省调拨了七亿二千万斤粮食，调拨了四万多吨化学肥料，五千多吨农药支援灾区。对于灾区需要的木材、钢材、水泥等建筑器材，都如数满足要求和尽力优先供给。国家还准备继续调运粮食、肥料和建筑器材。在防汛和抢救灾民时，中央曾多次派出大批飞机到河北、河南、山东三省交通断绝的村庄，空投大批橡皮船、救生衣、汽轮胎及粮食，解救被水围困的灾民。同时国务院组织了六个工作组分赴受灾各省了解情况，协助工作。
    负责人说：受灾地区的善后工作各地也正在积极进行，以帮助灾民重建家园，恢复生产。江苏省被风吹坏的房屋已基本修复，吹倒的也修复了20—30％。安徽省倒塌的房屋已修好一半以上。河南省灾情最重的安阳专区移出的二十五万灾民，已有二十三万多人返乡生产。有灾各地的补种晚秋和开展副业生产的工作，也正在积极进行。
    负责人接着说，今年的灾情是严重的。但是就全国来说，没有1954年水灾灾害重；就局部地区来说，如河北、河南、黑龙江等省，却又比1954年重。同时，今年与1954年灾情比较，还有许多不同之点：一、今年主要是中、小河流决口、漫溢，长江、淮河等大江大河没有出问题，故人畜伤亡、房屋倒塌的比1954年少；二、今年受灾的主要是淮河以北地区，稻米减产少，小麦、杂粮、棉花等作物减产比1954年多；三、今年水灾来得早，不少地区麦、秋两季遭灾，而1954年遭灾较晚，群众收了一季麦子，因此，这类地区群众的困难要比1954年大；四、今年农村中已经基本上合作化，抗灾力量比1954年大大增强，加以历年水利建设有很大成绩，这是战胜灾害最重要的因素。
        今年灾情的状况
    负责人接着就分析了今年我国灾情的状况。他说：5月底6月初，淮河流域的安徽、河南、江苏三省发生水涝灾，小麦等夏收作物损失很大。8月上旬，浙江、江苏、安徽三省遭到了强台风的侵袭。浙江省遭受台风灾害的共有六十二个县、市，其中受灾较重的有二十五个县、市。江苏省沿海地区和安徽省淮河以南地区，也有不少房屋倒塌、人畜伤亡、农作物被风刮坏。与台风侵袭同时，河北、河南、黑龙江、吉林等省发生特大洪水，沿河和低洼地区发生了严重的内涝灾害，其中河北省受灾较重，受灾面积达四千二百多万亩。同时，湖南、福建、江西等省部分地区发生了严重的旱灾。
      抢救工作令人满意
    负责人对今年有灾各地的抢救工作甚表满意。负责人说，当灾害到来时，各地在党和政府统一领导下，依靠同灾害斗争有经验的人民，依靠农业社强大的集体力量，积极展开抗灾和抢救活动，大大减轻了各种灾害的危害。江苏省对沿海、沿江、沿湖的塘堤提前进行了加固工程，台风到来时，又加强了防守，使全省塘堤都没有发生溃决。上海市由于准备工作做得好，损失很小。安徽省广大的农业社在台风前和台风期间，积极组织社员抢收了二百三十四万亩早稻，很多地方还进行了围绳、扎把、壅根、培土等防风措施，使农作物减少了损失。河北、河南、黑龙江、吉林等省，从水情开始紧张以后，就抓紧了防汛抢险。数百万防汛人员，夜以继日地进行着“水涨堤高”“疏水归道”的斗争。哈尔滨市三十万防汛人员坚持不懈地斗争，终于战胜了洪水，确保了全市的安全。对于遭到灾害的人民，各地都多方面加以照顾。没有吃的给予急救，房屋倒塌的帮助修复，病伤的加以治疗，死亡的进行埋葬，使灾民生活上的各种困难，初步得到了解决。
    负责人说，在救灾工作的过程中，人民军队和非灾区人民都表现了高度热情来支援灾区人民。有许多堤防是完全由军队负责守护的，有些险工地段都是由军队开去抢救的。至于灾区附近非灾区人民也曾组织群众、供应物资给灾区，并对灾民进行安置。这种精神是令人感动的。
    记者问到当前灾害的情况，负责人说，目前汛期还未过去，估计雨、雪、霜、冻等灾害还有发生的可能，这几天苏北等地天气阴凉，对农作物生长很不利，3日晚间台风中心又在福建福州附近登陆。因此，我们要提高警惕，继续和灾害作斗争，预防新灾，并进一步做好救灾工作。
      灾区今后工作任务
    关于灾区今后工作任务，负责人指出主要是依靠与发动群众开展生产自救运动。这就是：
    一、要充分发挥农业社在生产救灾中的作用。凡与生产救灾无关的各项工作，该停的停，该缓的缓，集中全力领导灾区人民战胜自然灾害。
    二、生产救灾是突击性的工作，也是经常性的工作，既要生产，又要救济，这是灾区有关部门共同的任务，每一个部门都应负起一定的责任。各地最好设立生产救灾专门机构负责经常工作，同时要制订整个灾期的生产救灾的全面规划。
    三、迅速领导农业社开展灾区的生产。只要生产季节赶得上，就应该设法补种、改种农作物，能种什么就种什么，不要放弃任何可能的机会。灾区最大的问题是抢种小麦，各地必须尽一切努力排水种麦。保护耕畜是个大问题，各地必须大力解决饲料供应问题，或移出一部耕畜到非灾区寄养，一定要把耕畜保存下来。副业生产是灾民度荒的重要依靠，要大力进行，并且动手要早，行动要快。灾区副业不同于非灾区，要着重开展投资小，收益快的副业。
    四、要合理而有效地发放和使用救济款。这些款应当很好地帮助灾民恢复家园，使受灾人民的生活及早安顿下来，并支持他们开展生产，度过整个灾期。
    五、做好灾区的经济工作。受灾各省的商业、供销社、银行及其他经济部门，一方面要适应灾后农村的供求情况，做好供应工作，使灾民生活上、生产上所需的必需品做到供应无缺。另一方面，要适应灾民生产自救的需要，做好产品收购和开辟销路的工作。
    六、用以工代赈的办法组织灾民参加水利、交通修建工程。
    七、重视并加强灾区的医疗卫生工作。要迅速组织中西医务人员到灾区进行固定的或巡回的医疗工作。同时，要帮助群众清理环境卫生，防止疫病。
    八、迅速制止灾民逃荒现象。各地对这一情况必须采取有效措施，加以制止。对于少数确有亲友可投，能自谋生路的，也应允许他们投奔亲友；对已经逃出的，应帮助他们解决临时困难，或遣送回乡。
