Silage

Silage is made by tightly burying juicy, green fodder, such as green grass, green corn stalks and leaves after harvesting, and sweet potato vines after digging up sweet potatoes, in cellars while they are still fresh and green. Silage can be preserved for a long time and retains the advantages of being green and juicy. Silage is a good way to solve the problem of the lack of green fodder in winter and spring.

Silage has many benefits. It reduces nutrient loss during feed processing. Silage retains about twice as many nutrients as sun-dried grass; it also has a pleasant aroma, which can promote livestock appetite and digestion. Various coarse stalks and vines, such as green corn stalks, sweet potato vines, and sunflower stalks and leaves, can all have their utilization rate improved after being ensiled. In rainy seasons and areas with a lot of rain, it is difficult to dry and preserve hay. Using silage can solve the problem of fodder storage.

In recent years, many places have promoted silage, which has been generally welcomed by farmers. In 1955, Shanxi Province made more than 530 million catties of silage, which provided coarse feed for 400,000 head of livestock to survive the winter. The potential for silage in various places is very high. One mu of sweet potatoes can produce 1,500 catties of vines, which, when made into silage, is enough coarse feed for one pig for half a year; silage made from two mu of corn stalks is enough fodder for one large cow for half a year. If all the corn stalks and sweet potato vines in the country this year are made into silage, it can basically solve the problem of fodder for livestock across the country this winter and next spring.

Pay attention to the following points when making silage:

First of all, pay attention to the moisture content of the silage raw materials, which is most suitable between 65% and 75%. If there is not enough moisture, add some water; if there is too much moisture, dry it a little. Second, the stalks and vines should be chopped as short as possible (no more than one inch), which makes it easier to compress. Third, when putting it into the cellar, fill and press it in layers, and it must be pressed tightly. Fourth, the cellar should be dug in a relatively high and dry place, the soil should be firm, and the bottom and walls of the cellar should be patted smooth; when there are many livestock, a rectangular underground cellar can be dug, with a cellar bottom width of eight or nine feet, a top width of one zhang, and a cellar depth of seven or eight feet, the length of the cellar can be determined by the amount of silage (each cubic foot can hold 30 catties of silage), and the four corners of the cellar should be made into rounded arcs. If there are few livestock, a round barrel-shaped cellar can be dug. A cellar with a diameter of six feet and a depth of nine feet can store about 10,000 catties. Fifth, the cellar must be sealed tightly. After the cellar is filled with silage, cover it with another layer of green grass; this not only makes it easier to compress, but also prevents the silage from being contaminated by mud. Cover the top with two feet of soil and press it tightly. If any subsidence is found later, it should be repaired immediately to prevent air leakage and water leakage. Drainage ditches should also be dug around the cellar. Silage can be taken out and used one month after ensiling. Well-preserved silage will not spoil even after several years.

Livestock that have not eaten silage before may not be willing to eat it at first. You can mix the silage with other feeds and feed it to them, and they will gradually get used to it. Do not feed silage to pregnant female animals in the late stages of pregnancy. If the silage is frozen, wait until the ice melts before feeding it to livestock.

This year, the wheat straw in many places has been moldy due to rain, and there will be a shortage of fodder after autumn. Therefore, now is the time to seize the opportunity to store as much silage as possible for winter and spring fodder. (Hu Xingzong)

    青贮饲料
    青贮饲料就是把多汁的青绿的饲料，如青草、玉米收获后青绿的茎叶、刚挖收甘薯后的藤蔓等等，趁着新鲜青绿的时候，紧实地埋在地窖里。青贮饲料能保存很久，并能保持青绿多汁的优点。饲料青贮是解决冬春缺乏青绿饲料问题的一个好办法。
    青贮饲料的好处很多。它能减少饲料处理过程中养料的损失。青贮的青草约比晒干的青草多一倍的养分；而且有香气，可以促进牲畜的食欲和消化。各种比较粗硬的秸蔓，如玉米的青秸、甘薯蔓和向日葵秸叶等等，经过青贮后都可以提高利用率。在雨季和雨水多的地方，不易晒制和保存干草，采用青贮方法，可解决饲草的贮存问题。
    几年来，不少地方推广了青贮饲料，普遍受到农民的欢迎。1955年山西全省做了五亿三千多万斤青贮饲料，就使四十万头牲畜有了过冬的粗饲料。各地青贮饲料的潜力都很大。一亩甘薯可产蔓一千五百斤，做成青贮饲料后就够一头猪半年的粗饲料；二亩地的玉米秸作成青贮饲料，就够一头大牛半年的饲草。要是把今年全国的玉米青秸和甘薯蔓都作青贮饲料，就可基本解决全国耕畜今冬明春的饲草问题。
    制作青贮饲料要注意几点：
    首先要注意青贮原料的含水量，大致在65％—75％之间最合适。水分不足的要加一些水，水分多了要晒一晒。第二、秸蔓要铡得愈短愈好（不可超过一寸），这样便于压紧。第三、入窖的时候要分层填压，必须压紧。第四、窖要挖在比较高而干燥的地方，土质要坚实，要把窖底窖壁拍打光平；牲畜多时，可挖成长方形地下窖，窖底宽八、九尺，上宽一丈，窖深七、八尺，窖的长度可随青贮饲料多少决定，（每一立方尺可装三十斤青贮饲料）窖的四角应做成圆弧形。如果牲口少，可挖成圆桶形窖，直径六尺、深九尺的窖约可贮一万斤左右。第五、封窖要严密。窖内装满青贮饲料后，上面再盖一层青草；这样不但容易压紧，又可防止青贮饲料被泥染污。最上面培土二尺来厚，也要压紧。以后如果发现塌陷，应当立即修补，防止透气漏水。窖的四周还应掘排水沟。青贮后一个月，就可以开窖取用。保存得好的青贮饲料，经过几年也不会变坏。
    没有吃过青贮饲料的牲畜，起先可能不大愿意吃，可以把青贮饲料同别的饲料掺合着喂，慢慢就习惯了。对怀孕后期的母畜，不要喂青贮饲料。若是青贮饲料结了冰，应当等冰融化以后再喂给牲畜。
    今年，很多地方的小麦秸秆受雨霉坏，秋后就会感到饲草不足。因此，现在应当抓紧时机把能够青贮的饲料尽量贮存起来，留作冬春饲草。　　　　　　　　（胡兴宗）
