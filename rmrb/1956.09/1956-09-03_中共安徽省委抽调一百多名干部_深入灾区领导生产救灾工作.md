Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, August 31st: The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) Anhui Provincial Committee has dispatched 166 cadres from its directly affiliated organs, who left yesterday for various counties in the Huaibei, Fuyang, and Bengbu Special Districts to strengthen leadership in production and disaster relief work.

At a mobilization meeting the day before their departure, these cadres listened to instructions from Gui Linqi, Secretary of the Secretariat of the CCP Anhui Provincial Committee, regarding production and disaster relief work. After analyzing the disaster situation in the Huaibei flood-stricken areas this year, Gui Linqi called on the cadres going to the countryside this time to seize the time to do the following five tasks well: First, it is necessary to organize and lead farmers to actively engage in production for self-salvation. Strengthen field management of mid-autumn and late-autumn crops, accelerate weeding, topdressing, and protect seedlings to ensure harvests and strive for increased production. At the same time, mobilize farmers to plant large quantities of vegetables and collect and dry vegetables to supplement food rations and save to prevent famine. In particular, preparations for wheat planting must be done well, seeds must be transferred, and fertilizers must be accumulated in order to sow in a timely manner. Second, organize disaster victims to develop sideline production according to local conditions and time, and develop both large and small sideline occupations within the agricultural cooperatives and household sideline occupations of the members. Supply and marketing cooperatives and other departments should vigorously support sideline production in terms of supplying raw materials and purchasing products. Third, assist local health departments in maintaining joint clinics to provide medical treatment for the masses in disaster areas. Fourth, protect draught animals and mobilize farmers to cut green grass and store winter feed for draught animals. Fifth, do a good job in disaster relief work in the disaster areas, distribute relief funds fairly and reasonably, and support disaster victims in production for self-salvation.
