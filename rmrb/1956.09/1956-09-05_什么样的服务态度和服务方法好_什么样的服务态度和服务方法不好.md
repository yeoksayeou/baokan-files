    Jinan's Newly Opened Sundries and Grain Store is Popular

    Recently, Jinan City Grain and Sundries Company opened two stores specializing in various sundries and grains. On the shelves of the stores, various weights of bagged coarse grains and flour are arranged. Underneath the glass of the counter, samples of the coarse grains are displayed, along with cards explaining their origin and how to eat them. Among these coarse grains are Qufu's fragrant rice, Jiangnan's glutinous rice flour, and Shandong's Southwest Plain wheat kernels and barley kernels. One day, a customer who bought wheat kernels here happily said, "Wheat kernels cooked with pumpkin may not be as fragrant as eating white flour and pork, but they have a unique flavor." Two customers with southern accents were satisfied to buy red beans they hadn't eaten for more than three years. Since the sundries and grain stores opened, they have sold an average of about 10,000 jin of coarse grains every day. In order to better meet the needs of the people, the company's staff not only went deep into various parts of Shandong to investigate the sources of minor grains and famous reproductions, but also specially transferred glutinous rice, japonica rice, broad beans, chicken macaroni, and cream macaroni from other places such as Jiangsu, Anhui, and Tianjin. They also plan to send people to Beijing, Northeast China, and other places to purchase some nationally famous coarse grains and food to supply the market. (Zhang Baoyi)

    济南新开杂品粮食商店受人欢迎
    最近，济南市粮食杂品公司，开设了两个专售各种杂品粮食的门市部。在门市部的货架上，排列着各种重量不同用袋子装好的杂粮和面粉。柜台的玻璃下面，陈列着杂粮的样品，并附有说明产地、吃法的卡片。在这些杂粮中，有曲阜的香稻米，江南的江米面、鲁西南平原的小麦仁、大麦仁等。一天，一个顾客在这里买到麦仁，便喜笑颜开地说：“麦仁煮南瓜，虽然不如吃白面猪肉香，但是别有风味。”二位操着南方口音的顾客满意地买到了三年多没吃过的赤豆。杂品粮食门市部自开始营业以来，每天平均售出杂粮约一万斤。为了更好地满足人民需要，这个公司的工作人员，不仅深入山东各地调查小杂粮和著名复制品的来源，还特地从江苏、安徽、天津等外地，调来江米、上粳米、蚕豆、鸡子通心粉和奶油通心粉等粮食。他们还准备派人到北京、东北等地购进一些全国著名杂粮和食品来供应市场。（张保义）
