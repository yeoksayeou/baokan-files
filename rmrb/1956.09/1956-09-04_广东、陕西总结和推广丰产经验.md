Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, September 2nd: The Guangdong Provincial Department of Agriculture recently sent cadres to the Pearl River Delta, the Leizhou Peninsula plains, and the mountainous areas of northern Guangdong to summarize the experiences in increasing early rice production, focusing on changes in farming systems and technological reforms. These experiences will serve as an important basis for guiding rice production throughout the province.

The summarized experiences prove that in these areas, changing double-cropping inter-season rice to double-cropping continuous rice, single-season broadcasting to double-season transplanting, and single-season to double-season rice cultivation can significantly increase production due to the expansion of actual cultivated area. This year, Zhongshan County converted 950,000 mu of double-cropping inter-season rice fields to double-cropping continuous rice, effectively more than doubling the transplanting area compared to the original. Simultaneously, through extensive plowing and winter sunning, the application of large amounts of river mud, and the improvement of irrigation and drainage systems, early rice production increased by nearly 100 million jin. Liannan County in the mountainous area of northern Guangdong, traditionally known for "high mountains and cool water," increased the area of single-season converted to double-season rice fields from 60,000 mu to over 90,000 mu this year. With the addition of technological reforms, it harvested more than 15 million jin of rice, more than doubling production compared to last year.

In addition, the summarized experiences also prove that implementing advanced technologies such as single-seedling close planting and small-clump close planting in these areas has played an important role in increasing production. Early sowing, dry sowing with aquatic cultivation, and early transplanting are certainly important measures for increasing production in areas where conditions permit.

Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an: The Shaanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture, the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the New Democratic Youth League, and the Shaanxi People's Broadcasting Station jointly held a broadcast conference on August 30th for rural youth to learn and promote wheat high-yield experiences. On that day, more than 100,000 young people in wheat-producing areas across the province listened to the broadcast.

At the broadcast conference, Liu Kuanyu, leader of the Liujiawan Youth Planting Group of the Qianjin Second Agricultural Production Cooperative in Wugong County, Shaanxi Province, reported on the experience of their group's youth wheat dryland experimental plot in achieving a high yield of 1,012 jin of wheat per mu this year. This high-yield record is nearly three times higher than the average wheat yield per mu in Wugong County. Liu Kuanyu said that this youth wheat dryland experimental plot achieved a high yield mainly because it fully implemented scientific cultivation techniques for dryland wheat. Wu Zhiliang, leader of the Youth Production Team of the Maojiacan Agricultural Production Cooperative in Caotan District, Xi'an City, and Li Yincheng, deputy director of the Wuyi Agricultural Production Cooperative in Nanwan Township, Huanglong County, also introduced the high-yield experiences of 1,116.5 jin per mu for paddy field replanted wheat and 905 jin per mu for mountain wheat, respectively.

This year, youth wheat experimental plots of youth production teams or planting groups in rural Shaanxi Province have generally achieved high yields. According to statistics, there are already 21 youth wheat experimental plots in the QinChuan area that have achieved a yield of more than 1,000 jin of wheat per mu, totaling 46.69 mu. The yields of these youth wheat experimental plots are generally more than twice as high as the yields of other fields in the local area. These youth production teams and planting groups have accumulated a lot of wheat high-yield experience in the process of conducting experiments. Therefore, the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Youth League and the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture decided to hold a broadcast conference before this autumn's wheat sowing to mobilize young people throughout the province to carry out a movement to learn and promote wheat high-yield experiences. They will also organize young people throughout the province to study and discuss these wheat high-yield experiences. At the same time, they require Youth League organizations and agricultural departments at all levels to use all effective forms, especially through technical transfer contracts and high-yield experience training courses, to widely impart wheat high-yield technology to young people.

    广东、陕西总结和推广丰产经验
    新华社广州2日电　广东省农业厅最近派出干部到珠江三角洲、雷州半岛平原和粤北山区等地，总结了以改变耕作制度和技术改革为中心内容的早稻增产经验。这些经验将用作指导全省水稻生产的重要根据。
    总结出来的经验证明：在这些地区，把双季间作稻改为双季连作稻、单季撒播改为双季插秧和单季改种双季稻，由于实际耕作面积扩大，因此都能显著增产。中山县今年把九十五万亩双季间作稻田改种双季连作后，插秧面积实际比原来增加一倍多，同时经过广泛犁田晒冬、大量施河泥和改善排灌系统，早稻增产近一亿斤。素来“山高水凉”的粤北山区连山县，今年单季改种双季稻田面积由六万亩增加到九万多亩，加上进行了技术改革，也比去年多收一千五百万斤稻谷，增产一倍多。
    此外，总结出来的经验也证明：在这些地区实行单株密植、小棵密植等先进技术，对增产也起了重要的作用。在具备条件的地区进行早播、旱播水育和提早插秧，也肯定是增产的重要措施。
    据新华社西安电　陕西省农业厅、新民主主义青年团陕西省委员会和陕西省人民广播电台在8月30日联合举办了一次农村青年学习和推广小麦丰产经验广播大会。当天，全省产麦区有十万多青年收听了广播。
    在广播大会上，陕西省武功县前进第二农业生产合作社刘家洼青年种植小组组长刘宽裕，报告了他们小组的青年小麦旱地试验田今年获得每亩产麦一千零十二斤的丰产经验。这个丰产纪录高出武功县全县小麦平均每亩产量近三倍。刘宽裕说，这块青年小麦旱地试验田获得高额丰收，主要是因为全面贯彻了旱地小麦科学栽培技术。西安市草滩区帽?冢农业生产合作社青年生产队队长吴志良和黄龙县南湾乡五一农业生产合作社副主任李印成也分别介绍了水田回槎小麦每亩产一千一百一十六斤半和山地小麦每亩产九百零五斤的高额丰产经验。
    今年陕西省农村青年生产队或种植小组的青年小麦试验田都普遍获得丰收。据统计，秦川地区获得每亩产麦千斤以上的青年小麦试验田，已有二十一块，共四十六点六九亩。这些青年小麦试验田产量比当地其它田地产量普遍高出两倍以上。这些青年生产队和种植小组在进行试验过程中，已积累了不少小麦丰产经验。因此，青年团陕西省委员会和陕西省农业厅决定在今年秋天小麦播种前，举办广播大会动员全省青年开展学习和推广小麦丰产经验的运动。并将组织全省青年学习和讨论这些小麦丰产经验，同时还要求各级团组织和各级农业部门运用一切有效形式，特别是通过技术传授合同和举办高额丰产经验训练班等向青年广泛地传授小麦丰产技术。
