    Cannot buy 2B pencil leads
    We are students of Tsinghua University and often need to use 2B pencil leads for drafting. However, we can't find these pencil leads anywhere in Beijing. In the past academic year, we have been painfully splitting whole 2B pencils and processing them for use. We hope that the pencil factory can produce 2B pencil leads of suitable thickness for drafting.

    Some towels are too flimsy
    On July 16th, I bought a "414" brand "Fu Zhong" towel for 8 jiao and 1 fen at the Second Sales Department of the Hanzhong City Branch of the China Department Store, Shaanxi Province. After using it for four or five days, two holes appeared on the edge of the towel. It continued to rot and, in less than ten days, the towel turned into a rotten rag.
    Then, I went to the Second Sales Department to buy another towel. Thinking that the previous towel rotted quickly possibly because I didn't spend enough money, this time I spent 1 yuan and 1 fen to buy a "63" brand "Queen" towel. This towel was large, thick, and pure white, with bright flowers and plants printed on both ends, so I was very satisfied. However, unexpectedly, this towel, finely made by the Jinle Weaving Factory, also developed holes after only six or seven days. What's even more embarrassing is that it shed lint when used, covering my face and hands with colorful fuzz.
    Why are the lifespans of these two towels so short? I hope the factories that produce these two towels can answer this question.　　　Liu Xiaolin

    Singlets and vests could be shorter
    Currently, the singlets and vests sold on the market are generally quite long. Whether they are for adults or children, they are often the right size in terms of width, but too long. None of the singlets and vests we several people have bought are any different. Such long singlets, tucked into trousers, make people feel uncomfortable. It is suggested that the knitting department appropriately shorten the length of singlets and vests. On the one hand, this can save raw materials and reduce costs; on the other hand, it can reduce the selling price and ease the burden on consumers.

    买不到2B铅笔芯
    我们是清华大学的学生，经常要用2B铅笔芯制图。可是，跑遍整个北京市，也买不到这种铅笔芯。在最近一学年中，我们都是忍痛把整枝的2B铅笔剖开，加工后再用。希望铅笔厂给我们生产适合制图用的粗细合适的2B铅笔芯。

    有些毛巾太不耐用
    7月16日，我在中国百货公司陕西省分公司汉中市支公司第二门市部用八角一分钱买了一条“414”副钟牌毛巾。用了四、五天，毛巾上边就烂了两个洞，以后越烂越厉害，不到十天，这条毛巾就变成烂抹布了。
    接着，我又到第二门市部去另买了一条毛巾。因为想到前次那条毛巾烂的快，可能是由于钱出的太少，这次便花了一元零一分买了一条“63”皇后牌的。这条毛巾又大、又厚，颜色洁白，两头还印着鲜艳的花草，所以我很满意。可是，不料这条锦乐织造厂精制的毛巾，也只用了六、七天就出了窟窿。更使人难堪的，是用起来掉毛，把脸上、手上都粘满了五颜六色的毛絮。
    这两条毛巾的寿命究竟为啥这样短呢？希望生产这两条毛巾的工厂回答一下。　　　刘小林
    汗衫背心可以短些
    现在，市场上卖的汗衫、背心，一般都比较长，不管大人、小孩穿的，往往都是粗细合适，长度有余。我们几个人买的汗衫、背心，没有一件不是这样。这样长的汗衫，扎在裤子里面，使人感到不舒服。建议针织部门适当缩短汗衫、背心的长度。这样一方面可以节省原材料，降低成本；另一方面可以减低售价，减轻消费者的负担。
