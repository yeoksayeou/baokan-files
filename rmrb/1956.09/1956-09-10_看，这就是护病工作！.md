Look, This Is Nursing!
　　Wang Shuze

　　A major surgery is underway. The anesthetized patient is breathing quietly. The surgical experts and their assistants are concentrating on performing various complex procedures. At this moment, a person is standing next to the surgical instrument table. She is constantly watching the surgical process, always holding the instruments that are needed. When the surgical expert says something softly, or turns his head, she promptly hands over the instrument that is needed. Her preparation is so accurate, and her delivery is so timely, that the entire surgical process proceeds without any interruption. Who is she? She is the skilled nurse in the operating room. Without her, the surgery cannot proceed smoothly.

　　It is late at night. The post-operative patient is lying in bed, sometimes asleep, sometimes awake. He feels very tired and wants to change position. At this moment, a person is standing next to the bed. She carefully observes the patient's complexion and breathing, sometimes feeling the patient's pulse. When the patient wakes up, she knows from the patient's expression where he is uncomfortable again, so she helps the patient raise his head a little higher, or raise his knees a little higher. She fully understands what might happen to the patient after which surgery, and what method she can use to relieve the patient's pain. Who is she? She is the skilled nurse in the surgical ward. Without her, the surgery will not achieve the desired effect.

　　In the infectious disease ward, there is a typhoid patient with a high fever, whose mind is no longer very clear, and sometimes speaks deliriously. At this moment, a person is standing next to the bed. She knows how to take care of the patient so that the patient can remain calm. Typhoid patients often refuse to drink water and eat, but drinking water and eating are very important for typhoid patients. She has a way to make the patient drink the water and eat the food. She knows what to give the patient so as not to cause intestinal bleeding and intestinal perforation. She knows how to feed water and food so as not to cause the patient to accidentally swallow water and food into the throat and trachea. Who is she? She is the skilled nurse in the infectious disease ward. Without her, the patient may develop various complications, or even die unexpectedly.

　　Is being a good nurse really as simple and easy as some people think?

　　Without deep sympathy for the patient, one cannot become a good nurse.

　　Without a cautious and meticulous work ethic, one cannot become a good nurse.

　　Without a flexible mind and skillful hands, one cannot become a good nurse.

　　Without familiarity with the science of life and understanding of the art of living, one cannot become a good nurse.

　　Without being able to do health education work, one cannot become a good nurse.

　　Medicine is for the service of human health. Who directly applies this science to the patient's entire life? It is the nurse.

　　The characteristics of nursing work can be summarized in eight words: "attentive and meticulous, exquisite and comprehensive." The nurse must observe the patient's every breath and every movement; the nurse must arrange the patient's life appropriately; the nurse must be meticulous in all preparations for examinations and treatments; the nurse must use all methods to implement the necessary treatment on the patient. To achieve such attentiveness, meticulousness, exquisiteness, and comprehensiveness, it is impossible without a wholehearted dedication to serving the patient. However, enthusiasm alone is not enough; one must have knowledge, experience, and skills.

　　A long time ago, nursing work was only undertaken by people who did not understand medicine. Later, with the development of medicine, nursing became a specialized science and technology.

　　Since nursing work has been transferred to the hands of specialized nursing technicians, patients have been able to receive comprehensive treatment, and the cure rate of diseases has also increased accordingly.

　　In the old society, people regarded detachment from practical life as noble. Because nursing work involves the most minute details of the patient's life, nursing work was despised in the old society.

　　However, even today, there are still people who look down on nurses, look down on nursing work, or only "appreciate" the nurse's spirit of service, but look down on the profession of nursing, only "sympathize" with nurses, but do not value nursing work. We cannot but say that the old ways still retain considerable influence among some people.

    看，这就是护病工作！
    王书泽
    一个大的手术正在进行。已经麻醉了的病人在安静地呼吸着。外科专家和他的助手们在聚精会神地做着各种复杂的手术。这时候，在手术器械台旁边站着一个人。她始终注视着手术的过程，随时把该用的器械拿在手里。当外科专家低声说一句什么，或者把头转动一下的时候，她就及时地把该用的器械递了过去。她准备得那样准确，递送得那样及时，以至整个手术过程一点没有发生停顿。她是什么人呢？她是手术室的熟练护士。没有她，手术不能顺利进行。
    夜深了。手术后的病人躺在病床上，时而睡着，时而醒来。他感到很疲劳，总想变变体位。这时候，在病床旁边站着一个人。她仔细观察着病人的脸色和呼吸，有时摸摸病人的脉搏。当病人醒来的时候，她从病人的表情上就知道他什么地方又不舒服了，于是她帮助病人把头部放高一点，或者把膝窝垫高一点。她完全懂得在什么手术之后，病人会发生什么情况，她用什么方法就可以解除病人的痛苦。她是什么人呢？她是外科病房的熟练护士。没有她，手术就不会收到应有的效果。
    在传染病房里，有一个伤寒病人，体温很高，神智已经不太清楚，有时说着谵语。这时候，在病床旁边站着一个人。她懂得怎样照管病人，可以使病人保持安静。伤寒病人常常拒绝喝水进食，但是喝水进食对伤寒病人又非常需要。她有办法使病人把水喝下去，把饭吃下去。她知道应该给病人吃什么，才不至引起肠出血和肠穿孔。她知道怎样喂水喂饭，才不会使病人把水、饭误咽到喉咙气管里去。她是什么人呢？她是传染病房的熟练护士。没有她，病人可能发生各种合并症，甚至发生意外的死亡。
    做一个好护士，真像有人想得那么简单，那么容易吗？
    没有对病人的深切同情心，不能成为好护士。
    没有谨慎从事，丝毫不苟的工作精神，不能成为好护士。
    没有灵活的头脑，没有灵巧的手，不能成为好护士。
    不熟悉生命的科学，不懂得生活的艺术，不能成为好护士。
    不会做卫生宣传工作，不能成为好护士。
    医学是为人的健康服务的。是谁把这一门科学直接用之于病人的全部生活呢？是护士。
    护士工作的特点，可以“体贴入微，精巧备至”八个字包括。护士要观察病人的一呼一吸，一举一动；护士要安排病人的生活，恰到好处；护士进行一切检查和治疗的准备工作，要丝毫不苟；护士要运用一切方法，把应有的治疗贯彻在病人身上。做到这样的体贴入微，精巧备至，没有全心全意为病人服务的热情是不行的。然而光有热情也不行，必须有学问，有经验，有技术。
    很久以前，护病工作只由不懂医学的人来承担。后来随着医学的发展，护病才成为一种专门的科学技术。
    自从护病工作转入专门护病技术人员之手，病人才能得到全面性的治疗，疾病的治愈率也即随之提高。
    在旧社会，人们以脱离实际生活为高尚。因为护士工作接触到病人生活的至微至细之处；所以，护士工作在旧社会被人轻视。
    然而，至今还有人，瞧不起护士，瞧不起护士工作，或者，只“赞许”护士的服务精神，而瞧不起护病这一门职业，只“同情”护士，而不重视护士工作。我们不能不说，旧的风气在有些人中间还保留着相当的影响。
