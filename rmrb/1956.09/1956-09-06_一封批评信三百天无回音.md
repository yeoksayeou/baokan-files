    A Letter of Criticism Unanswered for Three Hundred Days
    To the Editor:
    On July 9th of last year, my six-year-old daughter, Meiyu, suffered burns to half of her body. We took her to Changzhou People's Hospital for treatment. However, during the course of treatment, several medical accidents occurred in succession – maggots appeared on the patient's body twice, causing the child to develop a high fever and nearly die. As a result of the treatment, the child's arm became fused to her body, leaving her disabled.
    I wrote a detailed letter to Xinhua Daily on September 11th of last year exposing these situations. On September 22nd, I received a reply from the newspaper stating that it had been forwarded to the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Health for investigation and handling. On April 10th of this year, I wrote to Xinhua Daily again to inquire about the matter, and also informed them of my new work address, but this time I didn't even receive a reply. In addition, on October 2nd of last year, I also wrote a letter to Comrade Yu Chunkai, the Mayor of Changzhou, requesting an investigation and handling of the matter. Who knew that it would also disappear like a stone sinking into the sea, with no response for over three hundred days now. May I ask these organs or individuals who serve the people, where is your demonstration of valuing the people's letters?

### 一封批评信三百天无回音

    一封批评信三百天无回音编辑同志：
    去年7月9日，我六岁的女儿美玉烫伤了半个身躯。我们把她送到常州市人民医院治疗。可是在治疗过程中一连发生了几次医疗事故——病人身上生了两次蛆，孩子因此发高热，几乎死去。医治结果，孩子的胳膊又和身躯连在一起，成了残废人。
    以上这些情况，我在去年9月11日详细地写信向新华日报作了揭发。9月22日接到报社的复信，说是已转给江苏省卫生厅调查处理。今年4月10日我又写信给新华日报催问，同时告诉我新工作岗位的地址，可是这回连回信也没有了。另外，去年10月2日，我也写过一封信给常州市市长于春开同志，要求调查处理。谁知也像石沉大海，至今三百多天没有回音。试问这些为人民服务的机关或个人，你们重视人民来信的表现何在？
