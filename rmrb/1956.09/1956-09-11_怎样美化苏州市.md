    How to Beautify Suzhou
    Yu Pingbo

    Suzhou is a beautiful city with many historical sites. Beautifying the city is very meaningful and has sufficient conditions. First, the architectural art of the gardens inherits the traditions of the Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties. For example, Canglang Pavilion and Wangshi Garden are from the Song Dynasty, Lion Grove Garden is from the Yuan Dynasty, Humble Administrator's Garden is from the Ming Dynasty, and Lingering Garden is from the Qing Dynasty. Although they cannot be exactly the same as before, they still preserve a considerable scale. Now several major famous gardens have been renovated, preserving the traditional style, which can be said to be well and economically repaired. However, there are still some important ones that have not been repaired due to limited funding. For example, Wangshi Garden has been abandoned. The rockery of Huanxiu Villa is still there, but there are very few houses left. Huiyin Garden is located in a school, and its rockery and water features are not easily seen by the public. According to people from the Suzhou Municipal Cultural Relics Preservation Committee, there are about a hundred large and small gardens in the city. Its shortcoming lies in its dispersion. In the future, if they are gradually repaired and connected by shaded flower and tree paths, the whole city can become a large garden.

    Secondly, the construction of the city walls and the original urban planning are not only "ancient" but also very good. The construction of Suzhou City dates back to the Kingdom of Wu in the Spring and Autumn period, 2,500 years ago. Later, the earthen city was rebuilt into a brick city, but the specifications were roughly the same as before. To this day, the so-called "six city gates," such as Chang Gate and Xu Gate, still follow the names of the Spring and Autumn period. In the national scope, there are not many such cities. The streets are arranged in a grid pattern, intersecting perpendicularly. The waterways are also like this, with the main city river, the so-called "three horizontal and four vertical." The city is surrounded by city rivers like belts, both inside and outside the city circle. This is the same pattern as Beijing. It is very obvious that it is not a question of who imitated whom, but that they come from the same source. This is the excellent tradition of ancient Chinese city planning and construction.

    Now local people want to modernize Suzhou, which is good. Regarding the demolition of city walls and filling of rivers, I have some immature opinions. Speaking of demolishing the city walls, if it is for the convenience of transportation, then the function is not much. It is surrounded by two city rivers, inside and outside (the outer city river is the Grand Canal Xujiang River, which cannot be filled, and the inner city river is currently being dredged by the municipal government), and transportation mainly relies on bridges. It is the same whether it is not demolished or demolished. To make traffic inside and outside the city more convenient, it is enough to open more "gaps" and build some flat bridges. From another perspective, although the city walls have lost their military defense value, they are also one of the ancient architectural arts. If the city walls are properly preserved, with the surrounding rivers inside and out, flowers and willows planted on the rivers, and the ancient pagodas of North Temple and Ruiguang Temple embellished, it would not cost much manpower, and everywhere would be parks. Demolishing the city will result in a considerable loss in terms of historical sites and scenic spots, and it will be a case of losing more than one gains.

    The situation of filling rivers is slightly different and also similar. For the health of residents, it is right to appropriately fill in some shallow and silted small streams lacking water sources, like Suzhou's current plan. But in general, the characteristics of a water network city should be preserved. As the ancients said, "Households hide in misty shores, and all furniture is boats." Although the situation is very different now, the scene of "small bridges, flowing water, and houses" can often be seen in Suzhou City. Like Panjia Lane and Niujia Lane, that side of the river house faces the water, this side is trees along the river, and over there is a narrow road, with houses on the side of the road. Between the two banks, many small bridges span across. Such alleys show the scenery of the water country, which is very beautiful. Water and trees, in the city, are like a pair of beautiful eyes of a beauty. Some people may think that the city river is very dirty, which is also true. But I think the cleanliness and dirtiness of water is not a problem in itself, but depends on whether people pollute the water. Dredging the waterways and keeping them clean regularly will beautify the city and not hinder environmental hygiene. This seems better than simply filling them up. In the future, if flowers, plants and trees are planted next to the river, Suzhou's city appearance can be even more beautiful. We should not only plan for the present, but also have a long-term plan.

    怎样美化苏州市
    俞平伯
    苏州是个美丽的城市，历史的古迹亦很多。美化市容是很有意义的，且有足够的条件的。第一，园林的建筑艺术继承宋、元、明、清四代的传统。如沧浪亭、网师园都是宋，狮子林是元，拙政园是明，留园等等是清。虽已不能完全跟原来相同，却总保存了相当的规模。现在几个主要的名园都修整了，保存了传统的风格，可谓修得又好又省。却还有一些重要的，以限于经费尚未修缮。如网师园已荒废了。环秀山庄假山还在，房屋已很少。惠荫园在一个学校里，它的假山水，公众不容易看到。据苏州市文物保管委员会人说，全市大小园林约有百余处。它的缺点就在于分散。将来逐步修建，用花木的荫道连结起来，则全城可成为一个大花园。
    其次，城池的建筑，原来城区的规划，不但是“古”，而且很好。苏州城建自春秋吴国，距今二千五百年，后来将土城改筑砖城，而规范大致如昔。至今所谓“六城门”，如阊门、胥门等，还沿袭春秋时的名称。在全国范围，这样的城就不多。街道纵横平行相交，作棋盘式。水道也是这样，主要的城河，所谓“三横四直”。城圈以内以外都有城河如带地环绕着。这跟北京是一个格局。很显明，不是谁因袭谁，乃同出一源。这是中国古代城池建筑规划的优良传统。
    现在本地人士要现代化苏州市，这本是好的。对于拆城填河，个人有些不成熟的意见。就拆城说，若为交通方便起见，则功用并不多。它以里外两条城河环着（外城河是运河胥江，不能填塞，内城河现市府已在疏浚），交通主要靠桥梁，不拆是这样，拆了也还是这样。要使城内外交通便利，多开些“豁口”造些平桥也就可以了。若从另一方面想，城垣现虽失掉军事防御的价值，但它本身亦是古代建筑艺术之一。如适当地保存城垣，配着里里外外的河水，河上种了花柳，更有北寺、瑞光等古塔点缀着，并不费多少人力，而处处都是公园。拆了城，在古迹名胜方面却有不小的损失，而且是得不偿失的。
    填河情形稍有不同，亦复类似。为了居民的卫生，适当填平一部分缺少水源淤浅的小浜，像苏市目前这样的计划也是对的。但大体上还该保存水网城市的特色。古人所谓“户藏烟浦，家具尽船”。今昔情形虽很不同，但“小桥流水人家”这种光景，苏州城里往往可以看到。像?葭巷、钮家巷，那一面河房临水，这一面靠河是树木，过来是窄窄的一条路，道旁又有人家。两岸之间，好些小桥横跨着。这样的巷陌表现了水国的风光，非常秀美。水和树木，在都市里，仿佛美人的一双眼睛。有人或者觉得城河很脏，这也是事实。但我以为水的洁净污秽不是本身的问题，在乎人们把不把水来弄脏。疏浚水道，经常保持清洁，一面美化城市，一面并不妨碍环境的卫生。这比一味地填塞，似乎要好一点。将来河道旁边种上花草树木，这苏州的市容更可以美丽了。我们不仅应为目前打算，并且应该有远景的规划。
