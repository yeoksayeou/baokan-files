Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, September 9th. The technical design documents for the railway electrification section of China's first electrified railway, the Baoji-Fengxian section of the Baocheng Railway, were recently assessed by the Ministry of Railways and deemed to be of qualified quality and suitable for practical use. This was designed by Chinese technicians themselves.

The railway from Baoji to Fengxian is 90.4 kilometers long and has already been laid with tracks, but to run electric locomotives, it is necessary to build a set of electrification equipment. The completed railway electrification technical design includes the entire design of the contact network, traction substations, power supply section, and electric locomotive depot on this section. After the railway is electrified, electric locomotives can be used. Electric locomotives have greater traction and higher speed, and their transportation capacity is twice that of steam locomotives, so the freight cost is also lower than that of steam locomotives. At the same time, because electric locomotives do not produce smoke, the health of passengers and drivers will not be affected when traveling on the Baocheng Railway, which has many tunnels.

    使宝凤段铁路电气化
    我国技术员完成部分技术设计
    新华社兰州9日电　我国第一条电气化铁路——宝成铁路宝（鸡）凤（县）段的铁道电气化部分技术设计文件，最近经铁道部鉴定以后，认为质量合格，能够符合实用。这是由我国技术人员自己设计的。
    从宝鸡至凤县段的铁路长九十点四公里，已经铺好轨道，但是要行驶电气机车，还需要建设一套电气化的设备。现在已经完成的铁道电气化技术设计，就是包括这段线上的接触线网、牵引变电所、供电段、电气机车库等整套设计。铁道电气化以后可以行驶电气机车。电气机车牵引力大、速度高，运输能力比蒸气机车高一倍，因此运费也较蒸气机车低廉。同时因为电气机车没有煤烟，在隧道连绵的宝成铁路上行驶时，旅客和司机的健康都不会受影响。
