    Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, September 1st - The "People's Daily" today reported that the General Secretary of the Indonesian Communist Party, D.N. Aidit, strongly protested the West German authorities' declaration of the German Communist Party as illegal.
    In a telegram to Adenauer, he said that more than one million Indonesian communists and all progressive people here strongly protest the West German authorities' despicable action of declaring the German Communist Party illegal. Since its establishment, the German Communist Party has always stood at the forefront of defending German civilization and striving for a bright future for the German people. The telegram demanded that the West German authorities revoke this action, which is a replica of Hitler's policies.
    Xinhua News Agency, September 1st, Copenhagen dispatch: Danish trade union leader Espersen said at a mass meeting on August 29, commemorating the thirteenth anniversary of the Danish government's severing relations with the Hitler government, that Adenauer's policy of engaging in an arms race and persecuting communists and progressive people "resembles the Nazi movement of the 1930s in many ways."
    Espersen said: We know that such actions were the preliminary steps taken by Hitler before banning the Social Democratic Party and persecuting the trade union movement. Subsequently, the arms race accelerated, and the terror against people with different political views spread to other countries, including Denmark, during World War II.
    Espersen demanded that the Danish government: not be involved in West Germany's banning of the Communist Party, and remind West Germany's "allies" to pay attention to the fact that such banning actions have nothing in common with democracy.

    印度尼西亚共产党总书记
    严重抗议西德当局取缔德共
    丹麦工会领袖指出禁止德共是迫害工会的先声
    新华社雅加达1日电　“人民日报”今天报道，印度尼西亚共产党总书记艾地对西德当局宣布德国共产党非法提出严重抗议。
    他在给阿登纳的电文中说，这里的一百多万印度尼西亚共产党员以及所有进步人士，严重抗议西德当局宣布德国共产党非法的卑鄙行动。德国共产党自成立以来一直站在保卫德国文明和争取德国人民美好的前途的最前列。电文要求西德当局撤销这种希特勒政策的翻版的行动。
    新华社1日讯　哥本哈根消息：丹麦工会领袖埃斯珀森8月29日在纪念丹麦政府同希特勒政府断绝关系十三周年的群众大会上说，阿登纳进行军备竞赛、迫害共产党人和进步人士的政策“在许多方面都像三十年代的纳粹运动”。
    埃斯珀森说：我们知道，这样的一些行动是希特勒在取缔社会民主党和迫害工会运动之前所采取的初步步骤。接着，军备竞赛加快了，对待有不同政治见解的人士实行的恐怖在第二次世界大战期间蔓延到包括丹麦在内的其他国家。
    埃斯珀森要求丹麦政府：不要同西德取缔共产党一事发生关系，并且提醒西德的“盟国”注意这样的事情：这种取缔行动同民主是丝毫没有共同之处的。
