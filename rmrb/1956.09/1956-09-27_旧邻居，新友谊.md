Old Neighbors, New Friendship
By our staff reporter

In distant times, our ancestors, who believed in Buddhism, often told their children: to our west, beyond the highest mountains, lies a solemn Pure Land, a peaceful country. There, the great founder of Buddhism, Shakyamuni, was born. This country is Nepal. Today, friendly envoys from this country steeped in ancient legends – the Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Nepal, Tanka Prasad Acharya, and his senior accompanying officials, have arrived in Beijing.

As the silver special plane carrying the Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Nepal circled in the sky, the traditional friendship existing between China and Nepal also seemed to soar in the sky. More than a thousand years ago, it accompanied Xuanzang and Faxian across deserts, over mountains, and along the roads of China, Nepal, and India. It also hovered over the Buddhist scriptures translated by the eminent Nepalese monk Buddhabhadra and the Chinese high priest Faxian. It also flies above the White Pagoda in Beihai Park, which stands under the blue sky of Beijing. That is the crystallization of the wisdom and skill of the outstanding Nepalese craftsman Araniko six hundred years ago. Today, with the arrival of Prime Minister Acharya, a new page has been added to this history of friendship.

The plane taxied smoothly on the runway, the cabin door opened, and Prime Minister Acharya stepped down the ramp. Premier Zhou Enlai walked forward with a smile. They shook hands firmly. This is the handshake of two ancient yet young countries. This is the handshake of two old neighbors for a new friendship. For many years, despite the world's highest mountains standing between us, they have never hindered the friendly exchanges between our two peoples. The emergence and development of this traditional and noble friendship, as Prime Minister Acharya said in his speech at the airport, must be credited to some hard-working pioneers on the road of cultural exchange between China and Nepal.

There were seven thousand people welcoming at the airport, smiling and cheering in the golden sunlight. As Premier Zhou Enlai accompanied Prime Minister Acharya towards the crowd, countless youthful smiling faces turned to them, and countless bouquets of flowers were presented to the Prime Minister and his wife. Young voices crisply shouted "Long live peace!" A girl from Tibet studying in Beijing, Quesangmu, blushed and presented a bouquet of flowers to the Prime Minister, her smiling eyes seemed to say: "Nepal is closest to my hometown!" Another Peking University student, Wang Pinliang, carefully pinned a small ruby ​​ornament on the Prime Minister's chest, using this kind gift to welcome the neighbor visiting from the other side of the great Himalayas!

Yes, we are old neighbors, but our new friendship will far exceed our past friendship.

    旧邻居，新友谊
    本报记者
    在久远的年代里，我们的信仰佛教的祖辈们常常告诉孩子们：在我们的西方，极高极高的山的那边，有一块庄严的净土，一个和平的国家。那里，诞生了伟大的佛教始祖释迦牟尼。这个国家就是尼泊尔。今天，从这个充满了古老传说的国家来的友好的使者——尼泊尔王国首相坦卡·普拉萨德·阿查里雅和他的高级随行官员来到了北京。
    当载着尼泊尔王国首相的银色专机在天空盘旋的时候，那存在于中国和尼泊尔之间的传统的友谊似乎也在天空翱翔。一千多年以前，它就伴随着玄奘和法显越过沙漠，翻过重山，跋涉在中国、尼泊尔和印度的道路上。它也曾经盘旋在尼泊尔的名僧佛驮跋陀罗和中国的高僧法显合作翻译的佛经上。它也还飞翔在矗立在北京的蓝天下的北海白塔上。那是六百年前尼泊尔杰出的工艺大师阿尼哥的智慧和技术的结晶。今天，随着阿查里雅首相的到来，这部友谊的历史上又增加了新的一页。
    飞机在跑道上轻快地滑行着，舱门打开了，阿查里雅首相走下扶梯。周恩来总理笑容满面地走上前去。他们紧紧握手。这是两个古老而又年轻的国家的握手。这是两个旧邻居在为了新的友谊而握手。多少年来，尽管世界上最高的高山横亘在我们中间，从没有阻挡住我们两国人民之间的友好来往。这种传统的高贵的友谊的产生和发展，正如阿查里雅首相在机场演说时所说的，不能不感谢在中国、尼泊尔文化交流道路上的一些辛苦的先驱者。
    机场上有七千欢迎的群众，他们在金色的阳光下笑着、欢呼着。当周恩来总理陪同阿查里雅首相走向人群的时候，无数青春焕发的笑脸转向他们，数不清的一束束鲜花献给首相和他的夫人，年青的声音清脆地高呼着“和平万岁”！一位从西藏到北京来学习的少女却桑姆红着脸送上一束鲜花给首相，她的微笑的眼神似乎在说：“尼泊尔离我的家乡最近！”另一个北京大学的女学生王品靓细心地在首相胸前佩戴上一个红宝石的小小的珍饰，她用这亲切的礼物来欢迎从伟大的喜马拉雅山的那边过来访问的邻居！
    是的，我们是旧邻居，但是我们的新友谊将远远超过我们往日的友谊。
