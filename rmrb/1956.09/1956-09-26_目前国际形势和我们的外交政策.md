    Current International Situation and Our Diplomatic Policy
    Speech by Vice Premier of the State Council Comrade Chen Yi
    I completely agree with Comrade Mao Zedong's opening speech and the reports made by Comrades Liu Shaoqi, Deng Xiaoping, and Zhou Enlai on behalf of the Party Central Committee.
    Our entire party and the people of the whole country are concentrating all their efforts on building our country into a prosperous, strong, and highly industrialized socialist state. To achieve this great task, it is necessary to strive for a relatively long-term peaceful international environment, which is the foundation that determines our foreign policy. Now, I would like to offer some opinions on the current international situation and our diplomatic policy.
    The Current International Situation
    The characteristic of the current international situation is that the forces striving for and safeguarding peace in the world are constantly developing and growing stronger, while the international reactionary forces pursuing policies of aggression and war are in an increasingly weakened and isolated position. This change in the balance of power is definitely leading the international situation toward relaxation.
    The American monopoly groups, which did not suffer much damage in World War II but instead made a fortune, tried their best to seize world hegemony after the war, and therefore carried out frenzied military, political, and economic expansion activities. The American monopoly groups not only militarized the national economy in their own country, but also forced countries that followed them to do the same, forced many countries to accept enslaving agreements, pieced together many aggressive military blocs, widely established military bases overseas, rearmed West Germany and Japan, constantly created tense situations, and openly threatened with atomic war. These aggressive and expansionist activities of the American monopoly groups were carried out under the banner of anti-communism. No one denies that the American monopoly groups hate the socialist countries and have never stopped thinking about eliminating them. However, the banner of anti-communism has been very conveniently used to cover up the political and economic expansion carried out by the United States in many countries outside the socialist countries, interfering in the internal affairs of these countries, infringing upon their sovereignty and national interests, suppressing their democratic movements and national independence movements, and carrying out struggles for markets. This so-called "cold war" and "strength" policy of the American monopoly groups is actually a policy of intimidation and blackmail through the threat of war.
    The American monopoly groups have tried everything, including military encirclement, trade embargoes, subversive activities, and even armed intervention, to contain the development of socialist countries, vainly attempting to restore the capitalist system in socialist countries. However, it is one thing for the American monopoly groups to attempt to do so, and quite another whether this attempt can actually be realized. The growth and unity of the socialist countries have definitely proved that this attempt is impossible to realize.
    Unprecedented Growth and Unity of Socialist Countries
    Today, socialism has gone beyond the scope of one country and has developed into a powerful world system accounting for more than one-third of the world's population and more than one-quarter of the world's land. The rapid progress in the construction of all socialist countries has proven the indisputable superiority of the socialist system. The great Soviet Union has victoriously entered its sixth Five-Year Plan. The Soviet people are working confidently to complete their basic economic task in the shortest historical period, that is, to catch up with and surpass the most developed capitalist countries in terms of per capita output. China and other people's democratic countries are also developing their respective national economies at a great speed.
    Great and unbreakable fraternal friendship has been formed between socialist countries. The relationship between our countries is an equal and mutually beneficial cooperative relationship, a relationship of mutual respect, mutual assistance, and common progress. Our countries all take Marxism-Leninism as our guiding ideology, and all have the common ideal and goal of communism. Our countries have full conditions for economic cooperation, exchange of technical experience, ensuring the most effective use of resources in each country, and the common rise of the economies of each country. Our countries all follow a peaceful foreign policy, support each other in the cause of defending world peace, and move forward side by side. All this is the foundation that makes our socialist countries consolidate their unity and possess invincible strength.
    The strength and consolidation of socialist countries have very important international significance. The increasingly strong and united socialist countries provide a strong guarantee for world peace and create unprecedentedly favorable historical conditions for the development and victory of national independence movements.
    The Struggle Against Colonialism is Flourishing
    Another development of world historical significance since the end of World War II is the vigorous upsurge and continuous great victories of the struggle of the people of colonial and semi-colonial countries against colonialism and for national independence. In World War II, the victory of the anti-fascist war with the Soviet Union as the main force was an important factor in inspiring this struggle. The victory of the Chinese revolution dealt a heavy blow to the imperialist colonial system. Now, not only are the people of Asia and Africa constantly winning new victories in the struggle against colonialism, but also the broad masses of people in Latin American countries are joining the anti-colonialist struggle. In the ten years since the war, more than 1.2 billion people, that is, nearly half of the world's population, have gotten rid of the status of colonies or semi-colonies. Even those countries that are still in a colonial and semi-colonial status, or are still economically dependent on imperialism, are no longer completely the "most reliable" and "inexhaustible" reserve forces of imperialism. The imperialist colonial system has collapsed irretrievably.
    As early as November 1919, Lenin pointed out in his report at the Second All-Russia Congress of Communist Organizations of the Peoples of the East: "After the period of awakening in the East, the modern revolution has arrived, in which all the peoples of the East participate in solving the fate of the world, no longer as mere objects of enrichment. The eastern nations are awakening, and they are taking practical action, and each nation must solve the problem of the fate of all mankind." Lenin's great prediction is now being realized.
    For a long time, the oppressed nations of the East, which account for the majority of the world's population, were regarded as backward and in a position to be manipulated and slaughtered by others, and therefore had no say in world affairs. This situation has fundamentally changed. Now, as Lenin predicted, the oppressed nations of the East have awakened and are taking practical action. They have found reliable sympathy and support from socialist countries. They are no longer the great rear of imperialism. On the contrary, they have increasingly become a positive force in promoting human progress. Some countries that were originally colonies and semi-colonies have embarked on the road of socialism under the leadership of communists, and some have achieved national independence under the leadership of nationalists. However, no matter how different the process of striving for freedom and independence is, countries that have taken control of their own destiny are united in safeguarding their sovereignty and independence. Special mention should be made here of Egypt's just action in nationalizing the Suez Canal Company. This just struggle of the Egyptian people has inspired the people of all countries opposing colonialism and has received the full support of the people of Asian and African countries and all peace-loving and just countries and people in the world. The era in which Western colonialist powers arbitrarily manipulate the fate of Eastern nations has definitely passed. Some leading figures in Western countries are unwilling to face up to the reality of the awakening of the East, and are unwilling to face up to the reality of the awakening of Asia and Africa. They have made serious mistakes, and if they do not correct their prejudices, they will make even more serious mistakes. In order to open their eyes, it is beneficial for me to repeatedly mention this point emphatically here!
    Countries that have just gained independence from colonial rule also deeply realize the importance of maintaining world peace and international cooperation in order to eliminate the economic and cultural backwardness caused by long-term colonial rule. Therefore, they are constantly striving to achieve this noble goal and have made important contributions. We all remember how actively the five Colombo countries of India, Burma, Indonesia, Ceylon, and Pakistan played in promoting the Geneva Conference to reach an agreement on the restoration of peace in Indochina. We should also mention the outstanding contribution made by our great neighbor, India, as a world power, in striving for peace and promoting friendship among the people of all countries. The first Asian-African Conference in history held in Bandung in 1955 even more convincingly proved that the people of Asian and African countries are not only constantly strengthening their unity in the common struggle against colonialism and for national independence, but also are increasingly becoming a new and powerful political force on the international stage in defending world peace and promoting peaceful coexistence among countries. Now, many major international issues, especially those directly related to Asian and African countries, cannot be resolved without the participation of the relevant Asian and African countries, or by disregarding the will of these countries.
    The colonialists are unwilling to see the increasingly rapid disintegration of the colonial system. The American monopoly groups, the largest and most greedy colonialists in the world today, are not only trying their best to support the collapsing colonial system, but also attempting to expand their colonial rule through new forms of colonial enslavement. However, no matter how new the methods of colonial enslavement carried out by American monopoly groups are, they cannot deceive the people of all countries who have suffered from the disaster of colonialism for a long time. In the Asian and African regions, more and more nationally independent countries have adopted a policy of peaceful neutrality, powerfully resisting the conspiracies of the American monopoly groups. They refuse to participate in aggressive military blocs, and do not allow themselves to be used as bases and tools for carrying out aggressive wars; they refuse to accept so-called aid with conditions attached, and do not allow colonialists to re-control and enslave them through this "aid." They oppose the American monopoly groups creating divisions and antagonism among Asian and African countries; they strive to promote peaceful coexistence and friendly cooperation among countries.
    The American monopoly groups are carrying out colonial expansion under the banner of anti-communism. However, the people who have suffered and are suffering from the disaster of colonialism know from their own experience that socialist countries support the struggle of all oppressed nations and resolutely oppose any form of colonialism. In contrast to imperialist countries, socialist countries adopt a policy of peaceful coexistence and friendly cooperation toward those countries that have gotten rid of colonial rule. The Five Principles initiated by China together with India and Burma are the embodiment of this policy. In order to establish an independent national economy and improve the living standards of their people, newly independent countries no longer need to beg their former oppressors, but can expect unconditional assistance from socialist countries in terms of modern equipment and technical experience. The friendship and cooperation between nationally independent countries and socialist countries are growing and strengthening day by day. The anti-colonialist struggle has been closely linked with the struggle for peace.
    The Movement to Defend Peace is Widely Launched
    At the same time, in all capitalist countries, the masses of the people have launched a widespread movement against war and to defend peace. Participating in this movement are not only the broad masses of workers, peasants, and intellectuals, but also an increasing number of bourgeois figures. They are increasingly seeing through the anti-communist smokescreen of the American monopoly groups. They clearly see that it is not the Soviet Union, not the new China, nor any other socialist country that threatens their interests, but the war policy of the American monopoly groups. It is precisely the war policy of the American monopoly groups that has brought them heavy military burdens and the danger of war. They support the socialist countries' proposal for universal disarmament, complete prohibition of atomic and thermonuclear weapons, and immediate cessation of the testing and experimental explosion of such weapons. They welcome the actual actions of socialist countries in reducing armed forces, cutting military spending, and many other measures taken to strive for peace. They know that in order to ensure the security and peace of Europe and Asia, socialist countries have proposed replacing the existing hostile military blocs with a system of collective security and collective peace that does not exclude any country. They also see that in order to ease international tensions, socialist countries have consistently advocated the peaceful settlement of international disputes, the peaceful coexistence of countries with different social systems, and the implementation of economic and cultural cooperation. Now, the struggle of the masses of the people in capitalist countries to improve living conditions, oppose the expansion of armaments, strive for peace, and oppose war is increasingly becoming an important factor in defending world peace.
    The opposition of the broad masses of the people in various capitalist countries to the aggressive and war plans of the American monopoly groups cannot but affect the foreign policies of these countries. In addition to the countries that have recently achieved national independence, more and more countries, including some Nordic countries, are unwilling to become objects of American power expansion, and are unwilling to be involved in military adventures and the vortex of expanding armaments. They refuse to participate in the military blocs organized by the United States and adopt a neutral policy of peaceful coexistence with socialist countries. Even in defeated countries such as West Germany and Japan, which are still occupied by the United States, there are more and more people who demand to get rid of American control and advocate adopting a peaceful and neutral policy. The American monopoly groups call this neutral policy "immoral." In fact, it is not the neutral policy that is immoral, but the war policy of the American monopoly groups themselves. Facts have proven that the neutral policy adopted by capitalist countries against the war policy of the United States is completely in line with their own national interests, and is also conducive to maintaining world peace. In current international affairs, the neutral trend of these countries is a growing trend, playing an increasingly important role.
    Sharp Contradictions within the Imperialist Camp
    The situation within the imperialist camp has also undergone great changes. Due to the certain degree of recovery and development of the economies of countries such as Britain and France, the monopoly position that the United States once had after World War II has been shaken. This has made the contradictions within the imperialist camp, especially the contradictions between the United States and Britain, more acute. The main European allies of the United States once tried to ensure their high profits by following the American monopoly groups in expanding armaments and preparing for war, and also hoped to maintain their vested interests with the help of their alliance with the United States. However, both of these assumptions have fallen through. The main European allies of the United States have found that the heavy military burden has become a serious obstacle to the development of their own economies, while the United States has taken advantage of its alliance with them to seize their vested interests and infringe upon their national sovereignty. On the other hand, the policy of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries to develop trade and economic cooperation with all countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, their active reduction of armed forces and military spending, and many other measures taken to strive for peace cannot but have a huge impact on the main European allies of the United States. This year, the trend in favor of peaceful coexistence has developed somewhat in the main European allies of the United States, which is by no means accidental. However, these countries, especially Britain and France, often do not adopt a realistic and era-appropriate attitude towards the national independence movements in Asia and Africa. Recently, on the Suez Canal issue, Britain and France, relying on the support of the United States, threatened Egypt with force, and even attempted to use a risky war provocation plan to seize Egypt's sovereignty over the Suez Canal, which is a clear example. In the 1950s, the "gunboat policy" can definitely no longer be used by imperialists to maintain colonial interests. If Britain and France continue to implement this policy, they will not only encounter resistance from the people who are striving for and defending national independence and opposition from all peace-loving and just people in the world, and will inevitably fail in the end; but also will lose the opportunity to establish equal, mutually beneficial, and friendly relations with Eastern countries on a new basis. If Britain and France rely on the strength of the United States to implement this policy, they will only be subjected to more blackmail from the United States in creating tensions and hindering peaceful coexistence among countries, in addition to having everything they still have now seized by the United States at the opportunity.
    War Policy Causes Widespread Dissatisfaction in the United States
    In the United States itself, the war policy of the monopoly groups has also caused widespread dissatisfaction and opposition. The policy of expanding armaments and preparing for war puts a heavy military burden on the broad masses of working people and small businesses, but brings unprecedented huge profits to the monopoly groups. The production and testing of weapons of mass destruction have also made the American people realize how huge a disaster the war policy of the American monopoly groups will bring to them. Therefore, the American people are constantly fighting to protect their vital interests and strive for peace. In the election campaign currently underway in the United States, both bourgeois parties have had to put forward the slogan of peace. Some of the more sober-minded people in the American ruling group have also begun to realize that continuing to implement the policy of expanding armaments and preparing for war will not only make the United States increasingly isolated, but also bring serious consequences to the American economy itself. Recently, some people in the American ruling group have also begun to advocate reducing armed forces, lifting the embargo, and adopting a more realistic attitude towards international affairs, demanding a "painful re-evaluation" of American foreign policy. Although these propositions are very incomplete, and although these propositions have not yet achieved a dominant position in the American ruling group, this phenomenon itself shows the predicament faced by the war policy of the monopoly groups.
    Now, all the peace-loving forces in the world are forming a torrent under the common goal of striving for peace and opposing war. The current international situation is conducive to world peace and unfavorable to the war plans of the monopoly groups to establish world hegemony. There is no doubt that the possibility of striving for peace and preventing war has greatly increased.
    Continue to Be Vigilant Against War Conspiracies
    However, the American aggressor groups will never voluntarily give up their plans for war and aggression. The struggle between international peace forces and war forces will still be a long-term and repeated struggle. In this struggle, it would be extremely wrong to lose vigilance against the danger of war. In order to strive for a consolidated and lasting peace, we must continue to make greater efforts unremittingly together with all peace-loving countries and people.
    Our Diplomatic Policy
    The People's Republic of China, from the time of its founding, has appeared on the international stage as a force for maintaining and consolidating world peace.
    All the efforts of the Chinese people now are to build our country into a prosperous and happy socialist industrial country. We need a peaceful international environment to carry out this peaceful labor. This fundamental fact determines our peaceful policy in diplomacy. As stipulated in the preamble to the Constitution of the People's Republic of China: "In international affairs, our country's firm and unwavering policy is to strive for the lofty goal of world peace and human progress."
    For seven years, the Chinese people, in accordance with such principles and policies, have defended the independence and security of their motherland, combated the destroyers of peace, and made important contributions in easing international tensions and promoting friendly cooperation among nations.
    Strengthen Unity and Cooperation among Socialist Countries
    The development, strengthening, and unity of the socialist system is the foundation for ensuring world peace. The Chinese people regard consolidating and developing our unity and cooperation with the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries as our top priority. Shortly after the founding of the People's Republic of China, it signed the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance with the great Soviet Union, and the powerful alliance between China and the Soviet Union formed a strong guarantee for maintaining peace in the Far East and the world. China has established permanent and unbreakable fraternal friendship with the Soviet Union and all other socialist countries. The imperialists have exhausted all their efforts to sow discord among us, attempting to undermine our friendship and unity. However, all these despicable tricks have ended in shameful failure. In a spirit of humility and mutual respect, strictly guarding against any great-power chauvinism and nationalism tendencies that may exist within ourselves, China's close cooperation and unity with other socialist countries has become more and more consolidated and developed day by day. Continuing to consolidate and develop this friendship and unity is our primary task.
    Support the Struggle for National Independence
    The Chinese people have suffered from the disaster of long-term colonialism. Therefore, the Chinese people naturally deeply sympathize with all struggles against colonialism and for national independence. At the Asian-African Conference, China, together with other Asian and African countries, solemnly declared that colonialism in all its manifestations is an evil that should be eradicated quickly. Whether on the issue of India's recovery of Goa, or Indonesia's recovery of West Irian, or Egypt's nationalization of the Suez Canal Company, or any other anti-colonialist and national independence issue, China has always stood firmly on the side of the oppressed nations and the invaded countries. The people of Egypt and the people of other Arab countries are on the western front in the struggle against colonialism, and the Chinese people fully support their heroic struggle. The struggle for national independence anywhere in the world is an important part of the struggle to defend world peace. We will continue to resolutely support all struggles for national independence.
    The Five Principles are the Basic Guidelines of Our Foreign Relations
    China firmly believes that countries with different social systems should coexist peacefully. China, together with India and Burma, jointly initiated the Five Principles of mutual respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence. China has strictly adhered to these Five Principles in international relations. For China, these Five Principles are by no means a temporary and expedient tactic, but the basic guidelines in our foreign relations. We have suffered from the oppression of imperialism for a long time, and we have gained our independence after a thousand hardships. We resolutely demand that other countries respect our territorial integrity and sovereignty, and we absolutely respect the territorial integrity and sovereignty of other countries. We grew up from the struggle against aggression and oppression. We deeply know the pain of being invaded, and we are still suffering from the harm of American aggression. However, we also deeply know that the aggressor will inevitably fail, and we will never invade others. We have gone through a long struggle to obtain the right to choose our own social system. We firmly believe that revolution cannot be exported, and we will never interfere in the internal affairs of other countries. We have long been subjected to discrimination from imperialism and bound by unequal treaties. In the long struggle for national independence, we have accumulated experience in uniting with the nations of the world that treat us equally to fight together. We are willing to establish economic and cultural ties and cooperation with all countries and people on the basis of equality, mutual benefit, and without any conditions attached. We have long been forced to live in continuous war disasters. We deeply know the preciousness of peace. Therefore, we not only demand a peaceful international environment now to carry out socialist construction, but even after we build socialism in the future, we will do our best to maintain world peace.
    Continue to Strengthen Friendly Exchanges Among Countries
    We cannot deny that for China, a newly emerging country, some countries and some foreigners still have some misunderstandings, or even some fears. In particular, because the imperialists are afraid of the widespread influence caused by the victory of the Chinese revolution, and are afraid of the powerful force that will inevitably be formed by the unity of 600 million Chinese people with other countries and people, they have fabricated many slanders against new China, and have carried out rumors and provocations between China and other countries. However, experience has proven that these rumors and provocations cannot stand the test of facts, and mutual barriers and misunderstandings can also be eliminated. In this regard, the extensive contacts and friendly exchanges between China and other countries have played a great role. The contacts between leaders of China and other countries have increased mutual understanding between countries and improved their relations. We have also welcomed people from all walks of life from different countries to visit China, and have sent many delegations to visit foreign countries. Through these friendly exchanges, our country has established ties with other countries, increased trust, eliminated misunderstandings, and developed friendship. We must continue to strengthen our work in this area in the future.
    Further Improve and Develop Relations with Other Countries
    At the time of the founding of the People's Republic of China, Chairman Mao, on behalf of the Chinese government, declared to the world: "The present government is willing to establish diplomatic relations with any foreign government that is willing to observe the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect for territorial sovereignty." Now, our country has established diplomatic relations with 28 countries with a population of more than one billion, and has established economic and cultural ties with more countries and broader peoples. China has established friendly and cooperative relations with many Asian and African countries on the basis of the Five Principles. China has also established normal relations with the Nordic countries and some other European countries. Although normal international trade is still hindered by the embargo, and international cultural exchanges are also subject to artificial obstacles from individual countries, China's trade and cultural ties with other countries have still made great progress in recent years. Now, there are some countries that, due to external pressure, cannot temporarily establish normal diplomatic relations with us. We believe that this situation will not last long. There are also some countries that ignore reality and attempt to exclude new China in international affairs. However, this attitude can only make them increasingly opposed at home and abroad, and make themselves isolated. There are also other countries that vainly attempt to create "two Chinas," saying that our territory Taiwan is another China, or an independently existing country. This conspiracy to infringe upon China's sovereignty and interfere in China's internal affairs is resolutely opposed by the Chinese people, and can never succeed.
    China is willing to coexist peacefully with all countries. In order to improve and further develop our relations with other countries, we need to continue to make unremitting efforts. We must actively develop our friendly relations with Asian and African countries, especially with countries neighboring China. We must also continue to gradually seek solutions to some practical problems left over from the old China between us and these countries through peaceful consultations in accordance with the Five Principles, and prevent imperialists from using these problems to sow discord. We must also strive to improve and develop our relations with Western countries. Our policy of peaceful coexistence does not exclude any country. We do not exclude even the United States.
    Oppose the U.S. Occupation of Taiwan and Interference in Our Internal Affairs
    The United States has always adopted a hostile attitude towards the People's Republic of China. The People's Republic of China was established under the circumstances of the failure of American armed intervention. Not long after the establishment of the People's Republic of China, the United States threatened and invaded China from Korea, Indochina, and Taiwan, the so-called "three fronts." Even now, the United States is still occupying our territory Taiwan and interfering with our liberation of the coastal islands.
    China has carried out resolute resistance against the United States' armed intervention and aggression. Because we know that only by resolutely resisting aggression can we defend peace. Experience has proven that only if we resolutely defend our national independence and national security will the aggressor be more sober and resolve international disputes through peaceful consultations. At the same time, we have not given up any possibility of easing tensions. China has contributed towards the Korean armistice and the restoration of peace in Indochina. Even for the dispute between China and the United States in the Taiwan area, China has proposed specific suggestions for holding a Sino-American foreign ministers' meeting for peaceful consultations.
    Now, the United States' actions of occupying Taiwan and interfering in our internal affairs have been opposed by more and more countries and the broad masses of the world's people. The United States' penetration and control of Taiwan in political, military, economic, and cultural aspects have aroused increasingly strong dissatisfaction and resistance from the Taiwan compatriots, including the Kuomintang military and government personnel. Our great motherland has become increasingly stronger. The possibility of peacefully liberating Taiwan is also greatly increasing. However, no matter what means are adopted to liberate Taiwan, Taiwan will inevitably return to the embrace of the motherland. The Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan cannot be prevented. If the United States does not give up its policy of occupying Taiwan and interfering in China's internal affairs, it will only sink deeper and deeper into the quagmire and will not be able to extricate itself.
    Comrades, the international situation is conducive to our socialist construction and conducive to our completion of the task of liberating Taiwan. Our country and people's efforts to strive for a peaceful international environment have also been successful. For the sake of world peace and human progress, we must strengthen the unity of all peace-loving forces in the world and continue to struggle. We firmly believe that under the strong and correct leadership of our Party, the Chinese people will achieve greater accomplishments and achieve more brilliant victories, both in the great domestic socialist construction and in the noble cause of safeguarding world peace.

专栏：

    目前国际形势和我们的外交政策
    国务院副总理　陈毅同志的发言
    我完全同意毛泽东同志的开幕词和刘少奇、邓小平、周恩来三同志代表党的中央委员会所作的报告。
    我们全党和全国人民正在集中一切力量把我国建设成为一个繁荣富强、高度工业化的社会主义国家。为了实现这个伟大的任务，就有必要争取一个相当长期的和平的国际环境，这正是决定我们对外政策的基础。现在，我就目前的国际形势和我们的外交政策，提供一些意见。
    目前的国际形势
    目前国际形势的特点是：世界上争取和维护和平的力量不断地发展壮大，执行侵略和战争政策的国际反动势力处于日益削弱和孤立的地位。这种力量对比的变化，使国际局势肯定地趋向和缓。
    在第二次世界大战中没有受到多大损失、反而发了横财的美国垄断集团，在战争结束后竭力企图夺取世界霸权，因而进行了疯狂的军事、政治、经济的扩张活动。美国垄断集团不仅在自己国内，而且迫使追随它的国家实行国民经济的军事化，强迫许多国家接受奴役性的协定，拚凑许多侵略性的军事集团，广泛地在美国国外建立军事基地，重新武装西德和日本，不断地制造紧张局势，并且公开地进行原子战争的威胁。美国垄断集团的这一侵略和扩张的活动，是打着反共的旗帜进行的。谁也不否认，美国垄断集团仇恨社会主义国家是实在的，而且未尝不想消灭社会主义国家。但是，反共的旗帜却很便当地被用来掩盖美国在社会主义国家以外的许多国家中，进行政治和经济的扩张，干涉这些国家的内政，侵犯这些国家的主权和民族利益，镇压这些国家的民主运动和民族独立运动，和进行争夺市场的斗争。美国垄断集团的这种所谓“冷战”和“实力”政策，实际上也就是以战争进行恐吓和讹诈的政策。
    美国垄断集团想尽一切办法，包括军事包围、贸易禁运、颠复活动以至武装干涉，来遏制社会主义国家的发展，妄图在社会主义国家中使资本主义制度复辟。但是，美国垄断集团企图这样做是一回事，这种企图在实际上能否实现却完全是另外一回事。社会主义国家的壮大和团结，已经肯定地证明了这种企图是不可能实现的。
    社会主义国家空前壮大和团结
    今天，社会主义已经越出了一个国家的范围，发展成为占全世界人口三分之一以上、占全世界土地四分之一以上的一个强大的世界体系。所有社会主义国家在各方面建设中的突飞猛进，证明了社会主义制度无可争辩的优越性。伟大的苏联已经胜利地进入了第六个五年计划。苏联人民正满怀信心地努力在最短的历史时期内完成他们的基本经济任务，那就是，要在按人口计算的产量方面赶上和超过最发达的资本主义国家。中国和其他人民民主国家也正在以极大的速度发展着各自的国民经济。
    社会主义国家之间结成了伟大的、牢不可破的兄弟友谊。我们各国的关系是平等互利的合作关系，是相互尊重、相互帮助、求得共同进步的关系。我们各国都以马克思列宁主义为指导思想，都有实现共产主义的共同理想和奋斗目标。我们各国有充分的条件进行国民经济的协作，交流技术经验，保证各国资源的最有效的利用和各国经济的共同高涨。我们各国都遵循和平外交政策，在保卫世界和平的事业中互相支持，并肩前进。这一切，就是使我们社会主义国家巩固地团结和具有不可战胜的力量的基础。
    社会主义国家的强大和巩固，具有非常重大的国际意义。日益壮大和团结一致的社会主义国家为世界和平提供了有力的保障，为民族独立运动的发展和胜利创造了空前有利的历史条件。
    反对殖民主义的斗争蓬勃高涨
    第二次世界大战结束以来，具有世界历史意义的另一个发展，是殖民地和半殖民地的人民反对殖民主义、争取民族独立的斗争蓬勃高涨，并且不断地取得伟大的胜利。在第二次世界大战中，以苏联为主力的反法西斯战争的胜利，曾经是鼓舞这一斗争的一个重要因素。中国革命的胜利，又沉重地打击了帝国主义殖民体系。现在，不仅是亚非人民不断在反对殖民主义的斗争中取得新的胜利，而且拉丁美洲各国的广大人民群众也正在投入反殖民主义的斗争。战后十年来，已经有十二亿以上的人民，也就是说将近全世界一半的人口，摆脱了殖民地或半殖民地的地位。即使是那些仍然处于殖民地和半殖民地地位的国家，或者是在经济上仍然是帝国主义的附庸的国家，现在也已经不再完全是帝国主义的“最可靠的”和“取之不尽”的后备力量了。帝国主义的殖民体系已经无可挽回地瓦解了。
    早在一九一九年十一月，列宁在东方各族人民共产主义组织第二次全俄代表大会的报告中就曾经指出：“在东方觉醒时期之后，在现代革命中就到来了所有东方各族人民参加解决全世界命运、不再只作发财对象的时期了。东方各民族正在觉醒，要实际行动起来，每族人民都要解决关于全人类命运的问题。”列宁的伟大预见，现在已经在实现中了。
    长时期以来，占有世界大多数人口的东方被压迫民族曾经被看作是落后的、处于任凭旁人摆布和宰割的地位，因而在世界事务中是没有发言权的。这种情况已经根本改变了。现在，正如列宁所预见到的，东方被压迫民族觉醒了，而且实际行动了起来。他们从社会主义国家那里，找到了可靠的同情和支持。他们已经不再是帝国主义的大后方，相反地，他们已经日益成为促进人类进步的积极力量。原来是殖民地和半殖民地的一些国家，有的在共产主义者的领导下走上了社会主义的道路，有的在民族主义者的领导下取得了民族独立。但是，不论争取自由和独立的过程如何不同，掌握了自己命运的国家，在维护自己的主权和独立方面是一致的。这里应该特别提到埃及把苏伊士运河公司收归国有的正义行动。埃及人民的这一正义斗争，鼓舞了反对殖民主义的各国人民，并且得到亚非各国人民和世界上一切爱好和平和正义的国家和人民的全力支持。西方殖民主义强国任意摆布东方民族的命运的时代，肯定地已经过去了。西方国家的某些领导上层人士，不愿意正视东方觉醒的现实，不愿意正视亚非两洲觉醒的现实，他们已经犯了严重的错误，如果再不改正自己的偏见，将要犯更严重的错误。为了打开他们的眼界，我在这里着重地反复地提到这一点，对他们是有好处的！
    刚从殖民主义统治下得到独立的国家，为了消除长期殖民统治所造成的经济和文化的落后状态，也都深刻地体会到维护世界和平和国际合作的重要。因此，他们不断为实现这个崇高的目标而努力，并且已经作出了重要的贡献。我们都还记得，印度、缅甸、印度尼西亚、锡兰和巴基斯坦这五个科伦坡国家，在推动日内瓦会议对恢复印度支那和平达成协议方面，起了多么积极的作用。我们也应该提到，我们的伟大邻邦印度，作为一个世界大国，在争取和平和促进各国人民友好方面，所作出的卓越贡献。一九五五年，在万隆召开的有史以来的第一次亚非会议更令人信服地证明，亚非各国人民不仅在反对殖民主义和争取民族独立的共同斗争中不断加强团结，而且在保卫世界和平和促进各国和平共处方面，也日益成为国际舞台上一支新的强大的政治力量。现在，许多国际重大问题，特别是直接有关亚非国家的问题，如果没有有关的亚非国家参加，或者漠视这些国家的意志，那是不可能得到解决的。
    殖民主义者不甘心看到殖民体系日益迅速的瓦解。美国垄断集团，这个目前全世界最大和最贪婪的殖民主义者，不仅竭力支持正在崩溃的殖民体系，而且企图用新的殖民奴役的方式来扩大自己的殖民统治。但是，不论美国垄断集团进行殖民奴役的方式怎样翻新，都欺骗不了长期身受殖民主义灾害的各国人民。在亚非地区，越来越多的民族独立国家采取了和平中立政策，有力地抗拒着美国垄断集团的阴谋活动。他们拒绝参加侵略性的军事集团，不容许他们自己被利用为进行侵略战争的基地和工具；他们拒绝接受附有条件的所谓援助，不容许殖民主义者通过这种“援助”重新对他们进行控制和奴役。他们反对美国垄断集团在亚非国家之间制造分裂和对立；他们努力促进各国之间的和平共处，友好合作。
    美国垄断集团是打着反共的旗帜进行殖民扩张的。但是，曾经受过和正在受着殖民主义灾难的人民根据自己的经验知道，社会主义国家是支持一切被压迫民族的斗争，坚决反对任何形式的殖民主义的。同帝国主义国家相反，社会主义国家对于那些已经摆脱殖民统治的国家，采取和平共处和友好合作的政策。中国同印度和缅甸一起倡议的五项原则，就是这种政策的体现。新独立的国家为了建立独立的国民经济和提高本国人民的生活水平，现在也用不着去向他们以前的压迫者乞求，而在现代化的装备和技术经验方面，可以指望社会主义国家的不附加任何条件的援助。民族独立国家和社会主义国家之间的友谊和合作，正在日益增长和加强。反殖民主义的斗争已经同争取和平的斗争紧密地联系在一起了。
    保卫和平的运动广泛展开
    同时，在所有资本主义国家里，人民群众展开了广泛的反对战争、保卫和平的运动。参加这一运动的，不仅有广大的工人、农民和知识分子，而且还有越来越多的资产阶级人士。他们越来越识破了美国垄断集团的反共烟幕。他们清楚地看到，威胁着他们的利益的不是苏联，不是新中国，也不是任何其他社会主义国家，而是美国垄断集团的战争政策。正是美国垄断集团的战争政策，给他们带来了沉重的军费负担和战争的危险。他们支持社会主义国家关于普遍裁减军备、完全禁止原子武器和热核子武器、立即停止这种武器的试验和实验性爆炸的主张。他们欢迎社会主义国家裁减武装部队、削减军备和军费的实际行动。他们知道，为了保证欧洲和亚洲的安全和和平，社会主义国家已经提出了用不排斥任何国家的集体安全和集体和平的体系来代替目前存在着的敌对性军事集团的建议。他们也看到，为了和缓国际紧张局势，社会主义国家一贯主张和平解决国际争端，一贯主张社会制度不同的国家和平共处，实行经济和文化的合作。现在，资本主义世界各国的人民群众争取改善生活条件、反对扩张军备、争取和平、反对战争的斗争，正在日益成为保卫世界和平的一个重要因素。
    各资本主义国家广大人民对美国垄断集团的侵略和战争计划的反对，也不能不影响着这些国家的对外政策。除了新近取得民族独立的国家以外，越来越多的国家，包括一些北欧国家在内，都不愿意成为美国势力扩张的对象，不愿意把自己卷入军事冒险和扩充军备的漩涡。他们拒绝参加美国所组织的军事集团，采取了同社会主义国家和平共处的中立政策。就是在已经参加美国所组织的军事集团的国家中，也出现了越来越多的趋向和平中立的迹象。甚至在被美国继续占领的西德、日本等战败国，要求摆脱美国的控制，主张采取和平中立政策的人也越来越多。美国垄断集团把这种中立政策说成是“不道德的”。其实，不道德的并不是中立政策，而是美国垄断集团自己的战争政策。事实证明，针对着美国的战争政策，资本主义国家所采取的中立政策是完全符合于他们本国的利益的，而且也是有利于维护世界和平的。在当前国际事务中，这些国家的中立趋势是一个日益扩大的潮流，正起着越来越重要的影响。
    帝国主义阵营内部矛盾尖锐
    在帝国主义阵营内部，情况也发生了很大的变化。由于英法等国的经济有了一定程度的恢复和发展，美国在第二次世界大战后一度具有的独占地位动摇了。这就使帝国主义阵营内部的矛盾，特别是美英之间的矛盾，更加尖锐化了。美国的主要欧洲盟国曾经企图用追随美国垄断集团扩军备战的办法来保证自己的高额利润，又希望借助同美国的同盟关系来保持自己的既得利益。但是，这两种设想都落空了。美国的主要欧洲盟国发现，沉重的军费负担已经成为他们本国经济发展的严重障碍，而美国却正是利用了同他们的同盟关系，来夺取他们的既得利益，侵犯他们的国家主权。另一方面，苏联和其他社会主义国家在平等互利的基础上同一切国家开展贸易和进行经济合作的政策，他们主动裁减武装部队和军费的行动和其他许多为争取和平而采取的措施，对于美国的主要欧洲盟国也不能不产生巨大的影响。今年以来，赞成和平共处的趋势在美国的主要欧洲盟国中有了一些发展，这决不是偶然的。但是，这些国家，特别是英法，对于亚非国家的民族独立运动，常常不是采取现实的和合乎时代要求的态度。最近，在苏伊士运河问题上，英法两国依靠美国的支持，对埃及进行武力威胁，甚至企图用冒险的战争挑衅计划，来夺取埃及对苏伊士运河的主权，就是一个明显的事例。在二十世纪的五十年代，“炮舰政策”肯定地已经无法为帝国主义者保持住殖民利益。如果英法继续执行这种政策，他们就不仅会遭到争取和维护民族独立的人民的反抗和全世界一切爱好和平正义的人民的反对，最后必然归于失败；而且也会丧失机会在新的基础上同东方国家建立平等互利的友好关系。英法两国依靠美国的力量来执行这种政策，除了使他们自己现在还有的一切被美国乘机夺取以外，也只能在制造紧张局势和阻挠各国和平共处方面受到美国更多的要挟。
    战争政策在美国引起广泛不满
    在美国国内，垄断集团的战争政策也引起了广泛的不满和反对。扩军备战的政策把沉重的军费负担压在广大的劳动人民和小企业的身上，但是却为垄断集团带来了空前的巨大利润。大规模毁灭性武器的生产和试验，也使得美国人民了解到，美国垄断集团的战争政策将会为他们带来多么巨大的灾难。因此，美国人民正在不断地为保护切身利益和争取和平而斗争。最近正在美国进行的竞选运动中，两个资产阶级政党都不得不提出了和平的口号。美国统治集团中一部分头脑比较清醒的人也开始认识到，继续执行扩军备战的政策，将不仅使美国愈来愈加孤立，而且就是对于美国本身的经济也将带来严重的后果。最近，美国统治集团中也有一部分人开始主张裁减武装部队解除禁运，对国际事务采取比较现实的态度，要求对美国的外交政策进行“痛苦的重新估计”。尽管这些主张是十分不彻底的，尽管这些主张在美国的统治集团中还并没有取得主导的地位，但是这种现象本身就表现出垄断集团战争政策所处的窘境。
    现在，全世界各种爱好和平的力量在争取和平和反对战争的共同目标下，正在形成一支洪流。当前的国际形势是有利于世界和平、不利于垄断集团建立世界霸权的战争计划的。毫无疑问，争取和平和防止战争的可能性已经大大地增长了。
    继续警惕战争阴谋
    但是，美国侵略集团决不会主动放弃他们的战争和侵略的计划。国际和平力量和战争势力的斗争还将是一个长期的、反复的斗争。在这个斗争中，如果对战争危险丧失了警惕性，那将是极端错误的。为了争取巩固和持久的和平，我们还要同一切爱好和平的国家和人民坚持不懈地作出更大的努力。
    我们的外交政策
    中华人民共和国从成立的时候起，就作为维护和巩固世界和平的力量出现在国际舞台上。
    中国人民现在的一切努力都是为了把我们的国家建设成为一个繁荣幸福的社会主义的工业国家。我们需要一个和平的国际环境来进行这种和平的劳动。这个根本的事实就决定了我国在外交上的和平政策。正如中华人民共和国宪法在序言中所规定：“在国际事务中，我国坚定不移的方针是为世界和平和人类进步的崇高目的而努力。”
    七年来，中国人民根据这样的方针和政策，捍卫了祖国的独立和安全，打击了和平的破坏者，并且在和缓国际紧张局势和促进国际间的友好合作方面，作出了重要的贡献。
    加强社会主义国家之间的团结和合作
    社会主义体系各国的发展壮大和团结一致，是保障世界和平的基础。中国人民把巩固和发展我们同苏联和各人民民主国家之间的团结和合作，看作是自己的头等重要的任务。中华人民共和国建国后不久，就同伟大的苏联签订了中苏友好同盟互助条约，中苏两国的强大同盟形成了维护远东和世界和平的坚强保证。中国同苏联和所有其他社会主义国家建立了永久的、牢不可破的兄弟友谊。帝国主义者曾经用尽一切心机在我们之间进行挑拨，企图破坏我们之间的友谊和团结。但是，这一切卑鄙的伎俩都归于可耻的失败。本着谦逊和互相尊重的作风，严格警戒我们自己所可能存在的任何大国主义和民族主义的倾向，中国同其他社会主义国家的亲密合作和团结一天比一天地更加巩固和发展了。继续巩固和发展这种友谊和团结是我们首要的任务。
    支持争取和维护民族独立的斗争
    中国人民身受过长期的殖民主义的灾害，因此，中国人民很自然地深切同情一切反对殖民主义和维护民族独立的斗争。在亚非会议中，中国同其他的亚非国家一起，庄严地宣布，殖民主义在其一切表现中都是一种应当迅速予以根除的祸害，不论是在印度收复果阿问题上，或是印度尼西亚收复西伊里安的问题上，或是埃及把苏伊士运河公司收归国有的问题上，或者是任何其他反殖民主义和维护民族独立的问题上，中国都始终坚定不移地站在被压迫的民族和被侵略的国家的一边。埃及人民和其他阿拉伯国家的人民正处在同殖民主义进行斗争的西方前线，中国人民全力支持他们的英勇斗争。世界上任何地方争取和维护民族独立的斗争都是保卫世界和平的斗争的一个重要组成部分。我们将继续坚决支持一切争取和维护民族独立的斗争。
    五项原则是我国对外关系的基本方针
    中国坚信，社会制度不同的国家应该和平共处。中国同印度和缅甸共同倡导了互相尊重领土完整和主权、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利、和平共处的五项原则。中国在国际关系中严格地遵守了这五项原则。这五项原则，对于中国来说，决不是一个暂时的、权宜的策略，而是我国对外关系中的基本方针。我们长期受过帝国主义的宰割，经过千辛万苦才获得了自己的独立，我们坚决要求别国尊重我们的领土完整和主权，我们也绝对尊重别国的领土完整和主权。我们是从反抗侵略和压迫的斗争中生长起来的，我们深知被侵略的痛苦，我们至今还遭受着美国侵略的危害。但是，我们也深知侵略者必然失败，我们决不会去侵略别人。我们经过了长期奋斗才取得了选择自己的社会制度的权利，我们深信革命不能输出，也决不会去干涉别国的内政。我们长期受到帝国主义的歧视和不平等条约的束缚，在长期争取民族独立的斗争中积累了联合世界上以平等待我之民族共同奋斗的经验。我们愿意在平等互利而不附加任何条件的基础上，同一切国家和人民建立经济和文化的联系和合作。我们曾经长期被迫在连绵的战争灾难中生活，我们深知和平的可贵。因此，我们不仅在现在要求一个和平的国际环境来进行社会主义的建设，而且就是在将来我们建成社会主义以后，也将尽我们的一切努力来维护世界和平。
    继续加强各国的友好往来
    我们不能否认，对于中国这样的一个新兴的国家，有些国家和一些外国人士也还有些不了解，或者甚至于有一些疑惧。特别是由于帝国主义者害怕中国革命的胜利所引起的广大影响，害怕六万万中国人民同其他国家和人民团结起来所必然形成的强大力量，因此制造了许多污蔑新中国的谰言，在中国同其他国家之间进行造谣和挑拨。但是，经验证明，这种造谣和挑拨是经不起事实的考验的，相互间的隔阂和不了解也是可以消除的。在这方面，中国同其他国家之间的广泛接触和友好往来起了很大的作用。中国和其他国家的领导人员之间的接触增进了国家之间相互的了解，改善了彼此的关系。我们也欢迎了不同国家的各阶层人士来中国访问，并且派遣了许多代表团到外国访问。通过这些友好往来，我国同别国建立了联系，增进了信任，消除了误解，发展了友谊。我们今后还必须继续加强这方面的工作。
    进一步改善和发展同其他国家的关系
    在中华人民共和国建国的时候，毛主席就曾经代表中国政府向全世界宣告：“凡愿遵守平等、互利及互相尊重领土主权等项原则的任何外国政府，本政府均愿与之建立外交关系。”现在，我国已经同拥有十亿以上人口的二十八个国家建立了外交关系，并且同更多的国家和更广大的人民建立了经济和文化的联系。中国同许多亚非国家在五项原则的基础上建立了友好合作的关系。中国同北欧和其他一些欧洲国家也建立了正常的关系。尽管国际间的正常贸易仍旧受到禁运的阻挠，国际间的文化交流也遭到了个别国家的人为的障碍，中国同其他国家的贸易和文化联系在近年来仍旧有了很大的发展。现在，有一些国家，由于外来的压力，暂时还不能同我们建立正常的外交关系，我们相信，这种情况是不会长久的。有一些国家无视现实，企图在国际事务中排斥新中国，但是，这种态度只能使他们日益遭到国内外的反对，使他们自己陷于孤立。另外还有一些国家妄想制造“两个中国”，把我国的领土台湾说成是另外一个中国，或者说成是独立存在的一个国家。这种侵犯中国主权和干涉中国内政的阴谋，是中国人民坚决反对的，而且也决不可能得逞。
    中国愿意同一切国家和平共处。为了改善和进一步发展我们同其他国家的关系，还需要我们继续不断地努力。我们必须积极发展我们同亚非国家之间的友好关系，特别是同中国邻近的国家的关系。对于旧中国所遗留下来的在我们同这些国家之间的一些实际问题，我们也必须继续根据五项原则同这些国家经过和平协商逐步地求得解决，而防止帝国主义者利用这些问题进行挑拨。我们还必须努力改善和发展我们同西方国家的关系。我们的和平共处政策并不排斥任何国家。就是对于美国，我们也并不除外。
    反对美国侵占台湾干涉我国内政
    美国对于中华人民共和国始终采取了敌视的态度。中华人民共和国就是在美国武装干涉失败的情况下建立起来的。中华人民共和国建立以后不久，美国就从朝鲜、印度支那、台湾，这所谓“三条战线”上，对中国进行威胁和侵略。一直到现在，美国还侵占着我们的领土台湾，干涉我们解放沿海岛屿。
    中国对美国的武装干涉和侵略行动，进行了坚决的反抗。因为我们知道，只有坚决反抗侵略，才能保卫和平。经验证明，只有我们坚决保卫自己的民族独立和国家安全，侵略者才会比较清醒，才会通过和平协商解决国际争端。同时，我们也没有放弃任何和缓紧张局势的可能，中国对朝鲜停战和印度支那和平的恢复，作出了贡献。就是对于中美两国之间在台湾地区的争端，中国也提出了举行中美外长会议进行和平协商的具体建议。
    现在，美国侵占台湾和干涉我国内政的行动，已经遭到了越来越多的国家和广大的世界人民的反对。美国在政治、军事、经济、文化等各方面对台湾的渗透和控制更引起了台湾同胞、包括国民党军政人员的愈来愈强烈的不满和反抗。我们伟大的祖国已经日益壮大了起来。和平解放台湾的可能性也正在大大地增长。但是，不论台湾的解放将会采取怎样的方式，台湾必然要回到祖国的怀抱。中国人民解放台湾是不能阻止的。如果美国不放弃它那侵占台湾和干涉中国内政的政策，那将只能使它自己愈来愈深地陷入泥坑而不能自拔。
    同志们，国际形势是有利于我们社会主义的建设、有利于我们完成解放台湾的任务的。我们的国家和人民为争取一个和平的国际环境而作的努力，也是有成绩的。为了世界和平和人类进步，我们还必须加强团结世界上一切爱好和平的力量，继续奋斗。我们深信，在我们的党的坚强和正确的领导下，中国人民不论是在国内伟大社会主义建设中，或者在维护世界和平的崇高事业中，都将会获得更大的成就，取得更辉煌的胜利。
