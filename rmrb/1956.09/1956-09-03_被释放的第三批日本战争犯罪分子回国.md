Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, September 2nd: The third group of 354 released Japanese war criminals returned to Japan last night aboard the "Xing'an Maru" ship. The 56 family members of Japanese war criminals who had come to China in two previous groups to visit the convicted also returned home on the same ship.

Before the ship set sail, Ni Feijun and Ji Feng, representatives of the Chinese Red Cross, Wu Shifa, Secretary-General of the Tianjin Branch of the Chinese Red Cross, and Wu Haoran and Wang Zhendong, staff members of the war criminal management offices in Fushun and Taiyuan, visited the ship. The released Japanese war criminals gathered on the deck welcomed them with warm applause, and the family members of the Japanese war criminals also rushed out of the cabins to shake hands with them. Fujita Kiyoko, the wife of Fujita Shigeru, a Japanese war criminal who is still serving his sentence, embraced Ni Feijun as soon as she saw her and expressed her heartfelt gratitude. She said, "I will definitely work for Sino-Japanese friendship when I return. I saw my husband, and he is in good health."

As the ship was about to depart, Miwa Keiichi, the representative of the released Japanese war criminals, disembarked to thank the representatives of the Chinese Red Cross and read a farewell speech to the Chinese people.

In the farewell speech read by Miwa Keiichi, he said: We stand on the shore with infinite gratitude and bid you farewell. We will leave behind the heroic spirits of the 12 million Chinese martyrs and their families who were killed by Japanese imperialism and us in the past, and return to our homeland healthy and happy to embrace and reunite with our waiting families. However, those people we killed are sleeping underground forever and can never return. The heinous crimes committed by Japanese imperialism and us, and the grief and hatred of the martyrs' families will never be forgotten. We will deeply engrave the lessons of the first half of our lives in our hearts and never repeat the mistakes of the past. We will always remember the noble feelings and deep concern you have shown us. We will dedicate the second half of our lives to the struggle for the defense of peace, against wars of aggression, for the true independence of our homeland Japan, and for Sino-Japanese friendship.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, September 2nd: Representatives of the Japanese Red Cross Society, the Japan-China Friendship Association, and the Japan Peace Liaison Association, who came to China to escort the third group of released Japanese war criminals back to their country, returned to Japan last night on the "Xing'an Maru" ship. The representatives of these three groups transported 58 boxes of ashes of Japanese people who died in China, which were found by the Chinese Red Cross at the former site of the Japanese "Honganji" in Shanghai, back to Japan on the ship.

All members of the sixth "China Martyrs' Ashes Escort Group" and seven representatives of the Tokyo Overseas Chinese Association who escorted overseas Chinese back to Japan also returned to Japan on the same ship.

The thirteen Japanese journalists who came to China with the three groups also returned home on the "Xing'an Maru."

    被释放的第三批日本战争犯罪分子回国
    据新华社天津2日电　第三批被释放的三百五十四名日本战争犯罪分子在昨晚乘“兴安丸”轮船回日本。先后两批到中国来探望被判刑的日本战争犯罪分子的五十六名家属也同船回国。
    轮船启碇前，中国红十字会代表倪斐君、纪锋、中国红十字会天津市分会总干事吴士法以及抚顺和太原的战犯管理所工作人员吴浩然和王振东，曾到轮船上探望。聚集在甲板上的被释放的日本战争犯罪分子用热烈的掌声欢迎他们，日本战争犯罪分子的家属也纷纷跑出船舱争着和他们握手。正在服刑的日本战争犯罪分子藤田茂的妻子藤田喜代子一见到倪斐君就和她拥抱起来，向她表示衷心的感谢。她说：“我回去一定要为中日友好而努力，我看到了我的丈夫，他的身体很健康。”
    在将要开船的时候，被释放的日本战争犯罪分子的代表三轮敬一下船向中国红十字会代表致谢，并向中国人民宣读告别词。
    三轮敬一宣读的告别词中说：我们怀着无限感激的心情，站在海岸上向你们告别，我们将离开过去被日本帝国主义和我们杀害的一千二百万中国烈士的英灵和他们的家属而健康愉快地回祖国去、和等待着我们的家人拥抱团聚。然而被我们杀害的那些人们却长眠地下，永远也不能回来。日本帝国主义和我们所犯下的滔天罪行与烈士家属的悲哀和憎恨是永远也不会令人忘怀的。我们把前半生的教训深深地刻在心里，决不重犯过去的错误。我们把各位对我们的崇高的心情和深切的关怀永远记在心里。我们将贡献出后半生为保卫和平、反对侵略战争和祖国日本的真正独立以及中日友好而斗争。
