Premier Zhou Enlai's Speech at the Banquet Welcoming Prime Minister Acharya

Respected Prime Minister Tanka Prasad Acharya, Ladies and Gentlemen:

Tonight, we are holding a banquet here to welcome Prime Minister Acharya, representing the government of the Kingdom of Nepal, and other friends from Nepal, who have come to visit our country. On behalf of the Chinese government and people, I extend a warm welcome to you and express our sincere respect to the government and people of Nepal through you.

Prime Minister, you must have seen the enthusiasm shown by the Chinese people towards you and other distinguished Nepalese guests. This is very natural, because you represent a neighboring country that has had friendly relations with China for more than a thousand years. For the past century or so, the normal relations between our two peoples have been undermined and obstructed by the scourge of colonialism. After China and Nepal successively achieved independence, representatives of our two countries had friendly contacts at the Bandung Conference in 1955. In the same year, China and Nepal officially established diplomatic relations and determined the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence as the basic principles guiding relations between the two countries. Thus, a new page was turned in Sino-Nepalese relations. We are very pleased to see that since then, our friendly relations have been further developed on the original basis. Our mutual understanding has increased. Long-interrupted exchanges have also become more frequent. In May this year, Vice Premier Ulanhu of our country went to Kathmandu as China's special envoy to attend the coronation ceremony of His Majesty King Mahendra of your country. Two months ago, a cultural delegation from your country headed by Mr. Sharma visited China, leaving a deep and beautiful impression on the Chinese people.

Prime Minister, your friendly visit to China this time comes at a time when we are celebrating the signing of the "Agreement Between the People's Republic of China and the Kingdom of Nepal on Maintaining Friendly Relations and on Trade and Traffic Between the Tibet Region of China and Nepal" by the governments of China and Nepal. This agreement is a new milestone in Sino-Nepalese friendship. This agreement shows that between China and Nepal, just as between China and India, a friendly and close good-neighborly relationship has been established based on the Five Principles first initiated by China and India. According to the newly signed agreement between China and Nepal, Nepal has abolished the treaties that made Sino-Nepalese relations not completely normal in the past. We are very grateful for this friendly gesture from Nepal. As far as China is concerned, our socialist system fundamentally excludes the possibility of China carrying out aggression against any country. In the future, in our relations with Nepal, we will use practical actions to prove that we strictly abide by the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

The people of China and Nepal are peace-loving and freedom-loving people. In the past, we sympathized with each other in the struggle against imperialism, and today we need to cooperate with each other even more in order to step up construction in a peaceful environment. The Chinese people are working hard for the prosperity and strength of their motherland; as friends, we express our sympathy and admiration for the enthusiasm and efforts of the Nepalese government and people to build the country. We believe that in our respective construction work, we can definitely learn from each other and help each other in many aspects. Precisely because of this, Sino-Nepalese friendly relations have broad prospects for development.

The Chinese people highly respect and welcome the policy of peace and neutrality adopted by the government of the Kingdom of Nepal in international relations and the policy of promoting friendship and unity with all countries, especially Asian countries. Although some people are still trying their best to maintain colonial rule in Asia and Africa, the countries of Asia and Africa are constantly strengthening their unity in the common cause of opposing colonialism. The era when the destiny of Asian and African countries was at the mercy of others has definitely passed. I firmly believe that this friendly visit by the Prime Minister and other friends from Nepal will not only further enhance understanding and friendship between our two countries, strengthen ties and cooperation between the two countries in all aspects, but will also contribute to the unity of Asian countries and world peace.

Before I conclude my speech, please allow me to propose a toast:

To the further development of friendly relations between China and Nepal,
To the friendly unity between Asian countries,
To peace in Asia and the world,
To the prosperity of the Kingdom of Nepal,
To the health of His Majesty King Mahendra of Nepal,

Cheers!

    在欢迎阿查里雅首相的宴会上
    周恩来总理的讲话尊敬的坦卡·普拉萨德·阿查里雅首相阁下，女士们、先生们：
    今天晚上我们在这里举行宴会欢迎代表尼泊尔王国政府前来我国访问的阿查里雅首相阁下和来自尼泊尔的其他朋友们。我代表中国政府和人民热烈地欢迎你们，并且通过你们向尼泊尔政府和人民表示诚挚的敬意。
    首相阁下，你一定已经看到中国人民对你和对其他的尼泊尔贵宾们所表现的热情。这是很自然的，因为你们代表一个同中国具有一千多年友好关系的邻邦。近一百多年来，我们两国人民之间的正常关系由于殖民主义的祸害而遭受了破坏和阻挠。中尼两国先后取得独立以后，我们两国的代表曾经在1955年万隆会议上进行了友好的接触。同年，中尼正式建立外交关系，并且确定以和平共处的五项原则作为指导两国关系的基本原则。这样，中尼关系就开始了新的一页。我们十分欣慰地看到，从那时起，我们的友好关系在原有的基础上有了进一步的发展。我们相互的了解增进了。中断很久的往来接触也日渐频繁。今年5月，我国的乌兰夫副总理作为中国的特使前往加德满都参加了贵国马亨德拉国王陛下的加冕盛典。两个月前，以夏尔马先生为首的贵国文化代表团访问了中国，给中国人民留下了深刻而美好的印象。
    首相阁下，这次你到中国来进行友好访问，正是当我们在庆贺中尼两国政府签订“中华人民共和国和尼泊尔王国保持友好关系以及关于中国西藏地方和尼泊尔之间的通商和交通的协定”的时候。这个协定是中尼友谊的新的里程碑。这个协定说明，在中国和尼泊尔之间，正像在中国和印度之间一样，已经根据中国和印度首先倡议的五项原则，建立起友好和亲密的睦邻关系。根据中尼新签订的协定，尼泊尔废除了过去使中尼关系不完全正常的条约。我们十分感谢尼泊尔的这一友好表示。就中国来说，我们的社会主义制度根本排除了中国对任何国家进行侵略的可能性。今后，在我们同尼泊尔的关系中，我们将会用实际行动来证明，我们是严格遵守和平共处的五项原则的。
    中尼两国人民是爱好和平和自由的人民。过去我们在反对帝国主义的斗争中曾经互相同情，今天我们为了在和平的环境里加紧建设，更需要互相合作。中国人民正在为自己祖国的繁荣富强而努力工作；作为朋友，我们对尼泊尔政府和人民要建设国家的热情和努力，表示同情和钦佩。我们设想，在我们各自的建设工作中，一定可以在许多方面互相学习，互相帮助。正因为这样，中尼的友好关系是有广阔的发展前途的。
    中国人民十分尊重和欢迎尼泊尔王国政府在国际关系中所采取的和平中立政策和促进同一切国家、特别是亚洲国家友好团结的政策。尽管还有人竭力企图在亚洲和非洲维持殖民统治，但是，亚洲和非洲的国家在反对殖民主义的共同事业中正在不断地加强团结。亚非国家的命运受别人摆布的时代肯定地已经过去了。我深信，首相阁下和来自尼泊尔的其他朋友们的这次友好访问，不但将进一步增进我们两国间的了解和友谊，加强两国在各方面的联系和合作，同时也会有助于亚洲各国的团结和世界的和平。
    在我结束讲话之前，请允许我提议：
    为中尼两国友好关系的进一步发展，
    为亚洲各国之间的友好团结，
    为亚洲和世界的和平，
    为尼泊尔王国的繁荣，
    为尼泊尔国王马亨德拉陛下的健康，
    干杯！
