In recent years, the increase in rapeseed production nationwide has not kept pace with the needs of the people. There are many reasons for this, and the low price is an important one.

Currently, the national average purchase price for every 100 jin of rapeseed is approximately equivalent to 135 jin of wheat. This ratio is slightly higher than the pre-war level. However, because the increase in rapeseed yield per unit area has been slower than that of wheat in recent years, and production is very unstable and prone to disasters, the income from growing rapeseed is relatively low compared to the income from growing wheat. This does not stimulate farmers' interest in increasing rapeseed production. Consequently, the current rapeseed planting area is still far from reaching pre-war levels, which is also largely related to the low purchase price.

Therefore, raising the purchase price of rapeseed to stimulate farmers' interest in growing rapeseed and greatly developing rapeseed production is a pressing issue that needs to be resolved. The State Council has now decided to appropriately raise the purchase price of rapeseed. After the price increase, the average purchase price ratio of rapeseed to wheat in major rapeseed producing areas such as Sichuan, Guizhou, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Jiangsu, Yunnan, Hubei, and Hunan will be at a level equivalent to 200 jin to 230 jin of wheat per 100 jin of rapeseed. The specific increase in rapeseed purchase prices in the aforementioned major producing areas and other scattered producing areas will be determined by the Ministry of Food, based on its authority over price controls, and specific plans will be formulated and implemented.

It must be pointed out that, in addition to taking measures on prices, all localities should also pay close attention to solving various technical problems in production to greatly increase rapeseed production. For example, localities can vigorously promote the planting of superior rapeseed varieties such as Shengli rapeseed, based on local conditions, and quickly and effectively solve various practical problems related to the promotion of superior varieties.

The rapeseed planting season is approaching, and all localities should immediately announce the State Council's decision to raise rapeseed purchase prices to agricultural production cooperatives and farmers, actively lead farmers to expand the planting area of rapeseed as much as possible, especially superior rapeseed varieties, and strive to increase rapeseed production for the country in large quantities next year.

### 国务院关于提高油菜籽的收购价格的指示

    国务院关于提高油菜籽的收购价格的指示
    近几年来，全国油菜籽的增产，还赶不上人民的需要，其中原因很多，价格偏低是一个重要原因。
    现在全国平均每一百斤油菜籽的收购价格大约相当于一百三十五斤小麦。这一比价略高于战前的比价水平。但是由于几年来油菜籽单位面积产量的增长比小麦慢，生产很不稳定，容易遭灾，这样农民种植油菜籽的收益同种植小麦的收益比较起来，就显得偏低，不能刺激农民增产油菜籽的兴趣。因而目前油菜籽的播种面积还远没有达到战前水平，这与收购价格偏低也有很大的关系。
    因此，提高油菜籽的收购价格，以刺激农民种植油菜籽的兴趣，大量发展油菜籽的生产，是当前迫切需要解决的一个问题。国务院现在决定将油菜籽的收购价格适当提高。提价后，四川、贵州、浙江、安徽、江西、江苏、云南、湖北、湖南等油菜籽主要产区的油菜籽同小麦的收购比价，平均为每一百斤油菜籽相等于二百斤到二百三十斤小麦的水平。上述主要产区及其它分散产区的油菜籽收购价格提高的具体幅度，另由粮食部根据物价掌握的权限，制定具体方案，下达执行。
    必须指出，除了从价格上采取措施以外，各地还应当十分注意从生产上解决大量增产油菜籽的各种技术问题。比如各地可以根据当地情况大力推广优良品种的油菜籽如胜利油菜籽等品种的种植，并且迅速有效地解决有关推广优良品种的各项实际问题。
    油菜籽播种季节即将到来，各地应当即刻向农业生产合作社和农民宣布国务院提高油菜籽收购价格的决定，积极领导农民尽可能地扩大油菜籽、特别是优良品种油菜籽的播种面积，力求明年为国家增产大量的油菜籽。
