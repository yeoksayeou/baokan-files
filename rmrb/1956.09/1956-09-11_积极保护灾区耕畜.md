Collectively graze, individually foster.
Hebei Province's flood-stricken areas are taking measures to protect various draught animals, so that there will be no difficulties in animal power needed for wheat planting after the autumn harvest and for production next year.

In protecting draught animals, various disaster areas are adopting different methods based on local conditions. For example, collective grazing, individual foster care, or purchase by supply and marketing cooperatives for transfer to non-disaster areas for raising. According to statistics from three counties, including Anxin and Xushui, more than 2,500 draught animals have been driven to non-disaster mountainous areas for grazing. In addition, for draught animals in severely affected areas that are truly unable to maintain them, local supply and marketing cooperatives purchase them at reasonable prices. Currently, the supply and marketing cooperatives in four counties of Baoding Prefecture alone have purchased and transferred more than 2,000 draught animals to non-disaster areas.

To solve the problem of draught animal feed in the coming winter and spring, a grass cutting and weeding campaign is currently underway throughout the province. Many agricultural cooperatives have also specially organized grass cutting teams, and many agricultural cooperatives have also salvaged the stalks of flooded crops, washed away the mud and prepared them as feed. In order to facilitate the purchase of surplus forage from agricultural cooperatives in non-disaster areas, the Baoding Prefecture Supply and Marketing Cooperative is establishing hay purchasing stations in counties that have not been affected by disasters, so that the purchased hay can be supplied to disaster areas in a timely manner.

In addition, most disaster-stricken counties have transferred a certain number of veterinarians from veterinary stations to pastures or agricultural cooperatives to regularly check the health of draught animals and prevent diseases.
Veterinarians Treat Draught Animals by Region

According to statistics from 49 counties in Henan Province, there are now more than 9,000 rural traditional Chinese veterinarians who are adopting the method of contracting by region, touring various disaster-stricken areas to treat draught animals. Since June, more than 180,000 draught animals in the flood-stricken areas of this province have suffered from diseases such as gastroenteritis due to poor feeding management. After treatment by veterinarians, the vast majority of draught animals have recovered their health. At the same time, the Henan Provincial People's Committee has also allocated vaccines worth 110,000 yuan to supply to various disaster areas for universal injection of draught animals.

In order to protect draught animals in disaster areas to survive the winter smoothly, various places are actively taking measures to assist farmers in disaster areas to solve the problems of livestock sheds and feed. Ji County allocated 15 bundles of cattle hair felt and more than 3,000 enclosure mats to help farmers in disaster areas build draught animal sheds, solving the difficulty of more than 2,000 draught animals not having livestock sheds.

Currently, agricultural production cooperatives in many areas have formulated plans to reserve feed. Shangqiu Prefecture, in conjunction with the autumn harvest, has reserved more than 100 million jin of corn stalks. The 526 agricultural cooperatives in Xuchang Prefecture, in conjunction with autumn weeding and fertilizer accumulation, have already reserved more than 240 million jin of dried green grass. The leading organs of Anyang Prefecture organized Lin County, Hua County, Changyuan County and other counties to transport 12.4 million jin of forage to severely affected areas such as Neihuang and Tangyin. Many agricultural cooperatives in non-disaster areas near the mountains have voluntarily given the surplus mountain wasteland to nearby farmers in disaster areas to cut grass for draught animals to survive the winter.
Rush to Cut Green Grass and Store Feed

Bengbu Prefecture in Anhui Province is actively taking various measures to protect draught animals in disaster areas. Many agricultural production cooperatives in all 16 counties of the prefecture have formulated plans to rush to cut green grass. Members of agricultural cooperatives, in conjunction with the field management of late autumn crops, are rushing to cut green grass in the wild, on the edges of fields, and along roads. The Bengbu Prefectural Commissioner's Office has issued loans of 700,000 yuan to support agricultural cooperatives in purchasing green forage for draught animals.

Currently, it is the season when green grass is lush, and the work of rushing to cut green grass is progressing rapidly. Fengyang and Binghui counties have harvested more than 12 million jin of green grass. Lingbi County, which started earlier, has been feeding most of the county's more than 70,000 draught cattle with green grass since August 7, and has stored more than 11 million jin of dried green grass, which can supply the county's draught cattle for 71 days. Farmers in Chuxian, Dingyuan, Fengyang and Jiashan counties, which have many mountains and lush grass, are preparing to solve the difficulty of grass shortage for local draught animals, and are also preparing to support severely affected areas. While rushing to cut green grass, all counties are also universally mobilizing agricultural cooperatives to make silage.

Huaiyuan and Wuhe counties, which suffered severe waterlogging along the Huai River, have decided to transfer more than 7,900 draught cattle to the lush mountainous areas of Fengyang and Jiashan counties for grazing using the method of "moving cattle to grass" without affecting the autumn planting due to the special lack of feed. Agricultural cooperatives that are far away and close to the Tianjin-Pukou Railway are using trains to transport cattle outward with the help of the government. The government also helps solve the rations for the employees who go out with the cattle. Special personnel and veterinarians take care of the outward-bound cattle during the transfer and after arriving at the grazing location.

Agricultural cooperatives in various counties also pay special attention to strengthening the feeding management of young livestock, weak livestock, and sick livestock. For example, Lingguang Agricultural Cooperative in Lingbi County vacated four empty rooms and concentrated 42 young livestock, with six experienced employees responsible for feeding them, avoiding the phenomenon of large livestock and young livestock feeding in the same trough, where young livestock cannot squeeze in and cannot eat enough.

    积极保护灾区耕畜
    集体放牧个别寄养
    河北省水灾地区正采取措施保护各种耕畜，使秋后种麦和明年生产需要畜力时不致发生困难。
    在保护耕畜工作中，各灾区根据当地具体情况分别采取各种不同办法。例如，集体放牧，个别寄养，或者由供销社收购后调到非灾区饲养。据安新、徐水等三个县的统计，已有二千五百多头耕畜赶到非灾的山区放牧。另外，对于重灾区实在无力量保养的耕畜，各地供销社用合理的价格收购。现在，仅保定专区四个县的供销社就收购和调剂到非灾区的耕畜有二千多头。
    为解决今冬明春的耕畜草料问题，目前已在全省范围内开展了一个打草、锄草运动。很多农业社还专门组织了打草小组，许多农业社还将被淹的农作物的秸秆打捞出来，洗去污泥备作饲草。为了便于收购非灾区农业社多余草料，保定专区供销社正在没有受灾的县份设立干草收购站，以便把收购到的干草及时供应灾区。
    此外，大部分受灾县都从兽医站抽调了一定数量的兽医，到牧场或农业社定期检查耕畜的健康情况，防止耕畜疾病。
    兽医分片治疗耕畜
    据河南省四十九个县统计，现在有九千多名农村中的中兽医，正在采取分片包干的办法，在各受灾区巡回给耕畜治病。6月以来，这个省的水灾地区，曾经有十八万多头耕畜因为饲养管理不善，患肠胃炎等病。经过兽医的治疗，现在绝大部分耕畜，都已恢复健康。同时，河南省人民委员会还拨出价值十一万元的疫苗，供给各灾区对耕畜进行普遍注射。
    为了保护灾区耕畜顺利过冬，各地都正积极采取措施，协助灾区农民解决畜舍和饲草问题。汲县调拨了十五捆牛毛毡和三千多条围席，供给灾区农民搭盖耕畜棚，解决了二千多头耕畜没有畜舍的困难。
    目前，许多地区的农业生产合作社制定了储备饲草的计划。商丘专区结合秋收，已储备玉米秆一亿多斤。许昌专区的五百二十六个农业社，结合秋季锄草沤肥，已经储备晒干的青草二亿四千多万斤。安阳专区领导机关组织林县、滑县、长垣等县向内黄、汤阴等重灾地区调运了一千二百四十万斤草料。许多靠近山边的非灾区农业社，都主动地把多余的山荒，让给附近灾区的农民来割草供给耕畜过冬。
    抢割青草储备饲料
    安徽省蚌埠专区积极采取各种措施保护灾区的耕畜。全专区十六个县的许多农业生产合作社已订出抢割青草的计划。农业社社员们，结合晚秋作物的田间管理，正在野地里、田埂上和道路旁抢割青草。蚌埠专署已发放了七十万元贷款，支援农业社收购耕畜青草饲料。
    目前正是青草茂盛时期，抢割青草的工作进展很快。凤阳、炳辉两县已收割青草一千二百多万斤。动手较早的灵璧县，全县七万多头耕牛从8月7日起就已大部分以青草喂养，并已储存了晒干的青草一千一百多万斤，可供全县耕牛吃七十一天。山多草茂的滁县、定远、凤阳和嘉山四县农民，除了准备解决本地耕畜缺草的困难以外，还准备支援重灾区。在抢割青草同时，各县还普遍发动农业社做青贮饲料。
    沿淮河遭受严重内涝的怀远、五河两县，由于饲料特别缺乏，已决定在不影响秋种的情况下，用“移牛就草”的办法把七千九百多头耕牛转移到凤阳、嘉山两县牧草茂盛的山地放养。路途较远而靠近津浦铁路的农业社，在政府的帮助下，外移耕牛都用火车转运。随牛外出社员的口粮，也由政府帮助解决。外移耕牛在转移途中和到达放牧地点后，都有专人和兽医照顾。
    各县农业社还特别注意加强对幼畜、弱畜和病畜的饲养管理工作。如灵璧县灵光农业社腾出四间空屋，集中四十二头幼畜，由六个有经验的社员负责喂养，避免了大畜、幼畜同槽喂养，幼畜挤不上、吃不饱的现象。（据新华社讯）
