Xinhua News Agency, Da Qaidan, 5th. Another main highway line traversing the northern part of the Qaidam Basin in Qinghai Province—the trunk line from Da'erbote to Mangnai via Lenghu and the branch line from Lenghu to Shanbaodi—was completed and opened to traffic at the end of August according to design standards.

The northern trunk line and the Lenghu branch line are 506 kilometers long. They connect the major petroleum exploration bases in the Qaidam Basin with the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway through the Qinghai-Xinjiang, Chaka-Gansen, and Dunhuang-Golmud highways. Now, the equipment and materials needed by many petroleum exploration bases in the basin are being continuously transported from these two highways.

Before last year, there was not a single highway passable by cars in the Qaidam Basin. Now, thousands of kilometers of highways have been built in the basin, basically forming a highway network.

    柴达木盆地修成几千公里公路
    新华社大柴旦5日电　横贯青海省柴达木盆地北部的又一条公路干线——大俄博图经冷湖到茫崖的干线和冷湖到山包地的支线，已经在8月底按设计标准修成通车。
    北干线和冷湖支线共长五百零六公里，它们通过青新、茶（卡）甘（森）和敦（煌）噶（尔木）等公路，把柴达木盆地的各主要石油勘探基地和兰新铁路联接了起来。现在，盆地上很多石油勘探基地所需要的器材物资，正在从这两条公路源源运来。
    去年以前，柴达木盆地还没有一条可以通行汽车的公路。现在，盆地上已经修成了数千公里的公路，基本上形成了一个公路网。
