Xinhua News Agency report: The China Political Science and Law Society invited legal experts on the 29th to discuss how to implement the "Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" policy in the legal field.

Nearly forty legal experts and professors, including Zhang Zhirang and Wu Defeng, attended the symposium.

Wu Defeng, Vice President of the China Political Science and Law Society, spoke at the meeting about the current situation and problems in the legal field, as well as future work. He said that jurisprudence had a considerable development in Chinese history. However, in modern times, jurisprudence has been a backward and also a newly emerging science. There was no legal research institution in old China, and the Chinese legal research team has only been formed in recent years.

He said that the most urgent task at present is to study and summarize the rich experience of the people's regime and revolutionary legal system work over the past two decades, especially in recent years; legal scholars should also assist the state in its legislative work. The rich historical materials related to law in Chinese history remain to be sorted out; some important issues, such as the origin of the Chinese state and the historical stages of development of the state and law, need to be painstakingly studied. To accomplish these arduous tasks, it is necessary to implement the policy of "Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend." He pointed out that in the past, the legal field lacked an atmosphere of analysis, research, debate, and criticism, resulting in a dull state.

In their speeches, everyone believed that mobilizing all the forces in the legal field is an important aspect of launching the contention. Some people suggested that the situation where some legal experts have been detached from their profession for a long time must be changed. Some people criticized the current disrespect for senior legal scholars. Many people believe that the training of new forces should be strengthened in the future, and the China Political Science and Law Society should strengthen its organization, unite legal experts and young legal workers, study together, and change the current situation of mutual isolation.

    法学专家座谈怎样在法学界展开百家争鸣
    据新华社讯　中国政治法律学会29日邀请法学专家座谈在法学界如何贯彻百家争鸣方针。
    出席这次座谈会的有张志让、吴德峰等法学专家、教授近四十人。
    中国政治法律学会副会长吴德峰在会上就法学界的近况和问题，以及今后的工作等作了发言。他说，法学在中国历史上曾有过相当的发展。但是，在近代，法学却是一门落后的，也是新生的科学。旧中国没有一个法学研究机构，中国的法学研究队伍是近几年才形成的。
    他说，当前最迫切的是要研究总结二十多年来特别是近年来的人民政权和革命法制工作的丰富经验；法学家们还要协助国家进行立法工作。中国历史上丰富的有关法学的资料还有待整理；一些重要的问题，如关于中国的国家起源以及国家与法的历史发展阶段等问题，需要进行艰苦的研究。要完成这些艰巨的任务必须贯彻百家争鸣方针。他指出，过去法学界缺乏分析、研究、争论和批判的空气，以致呈现出一种沉闷的状态。
    大家在发言中认为，动员法学界的一切力量，是展开争鸣的一个重要方面。有人提出，有些法学专家长期脱离专业的情况必须改变。有人对目前某些不尊重法学界老前辈的情况提出批评。很多人都认为今后应该加强培养新生力量，中国政治法律学会应加强组织，团结法学专家和青年法学工作者，互相研究，改变目前互不通气的情况。
