    Artificially Creating "Everyone Advanced"
    Sun Guang
    When the advanced producer movement is carried out well, the enthusiasm of the masses for production continuously increases, advanced experiences are grasped by more people, production targets are thus completed well, and the ranks of advanced producers constantly expand. This is a universal law and an inevitable result of the movement's development. Therefore, honestly doing more work, deeply carrying out the advanced producer movement, completing production tasks is certainly not a problem, and expanding the ranks of advanced producers is also nothing to worry about.
    However, some people are not first concerned about how well the advanced producer movement is being carried out or how well the plan is being completed, but instead meticulously haggle over the number of advanced producers, racking their brains to allow more people to obtain the title of advanced producer. Thus, they make a big fuss about the standards for evaluating advanced producers.
    It is understood that in the textile industry system alone, there have been four kinds of standards for evaluating advanced producers. Originally, it was stipulated that completing the task comprehensively for three consecutive months would qualify one as an advanced producer. The leaders of some factories felt that this standard was too strict, so they changed "three consecutive months" to "an average of three months." The difference between the words "consecutive" and "average" resulted in a large number of additional advanced producers. This was still not enough, and some factories also felt that the "conditions were too high" and wanted to change three months to one month. But whether it was three months or one month, one still had to comprehensively complete the production task to be considered an advanced producer, which was still not "readily available." The Shijiazhuang Textile Factory then put their minds to work and formulated an "advantage-first" evaluation condition: as long as one had one strength, one indicator was completed well, regardless of how other indicators were completed, one could become an advanced producer.
    From "three consecutive months" to "an average of three months," from "one month" to "advantage-first," the evaluation conditions are gradually loosened, and the number of advanced producers naturally increases step by step. Thus, it seems as if the advanced producer movement is being carried out very deeply. Look, isn't the rank of advanced producers "constantly expanding"? Of course, the expansion of the advanced producer rank is a sign of how well the advanced producer movement is being carried out, but it is not the most important sign; the most important thing is how well the plan is completed. Adopting the method of lowering evaluation conditions can certainly "expand the ranks of advanced producers," but it does not help to complete the state plan. This is the case with the Shanghai Pharmaceutical Company. The number of advanced producers in this company in the second quarter increased by a factor of one compared to the first quarter, which seems not bad, but the production task was only 80% completed.
    If the evaluation standard for advanced producers is set too high, deviating from the current technical level, it will certainly dampen the enthusiasm of the masses and should be revised. However, if the conditions for advanced producers are lowered and the "ranks of advanced producers are expanded" artificially, even if "everyone is advanced," but the state plan is not completed, what is the benefit!

    人为的“人人先进”
    孙光
    先进生产者运动开展得好，群众生产积极性不断提高，先进经验被更多的人掌握起来，生产指标也就完成得好，先进生产者的队伍也就不断地扩大。这是普遍规律，是运动发展的必然结果。因此，老老实实地多做些工作，把先进生产者运动深入开展起来，完成生产任务固然不成问题，扩大先进生产者队伍也是不用发愁的。
    可是，有些人不是首先关心先进生产者运动开展得如何，计划完成得好坏，却首先斤斤计较先进生产者的数量多少，挖空心思要让更多的人得到先进生产者的称号，于是就在评定先进生产者的标准上大作起文章来了。
    据了解，仅仅纺织工业系统，就有过四种评比先进生产者的标准。本来规定连续三个月全面完成任务，就可以评为先进生产者。某些工厂的领导人员觉得这个标准太严，把“连续三个月”改成了“平均三个月”。“连续”同“平均”两字之差，就多出了大批先进生产者。这还不够，有的厂还觉得“条件太高”，想把三个月改成一个月。但三个月也好，一个月也好，总要全面完成生产任务，才评得上先进生产者，这还不是“唾手可得”的。石家庄纺织厂就来开动脑筋，订了个“一着先”的评比条件，只要有一手长处，有一个指标完成得好，不管别的指标完成得怎样，都可以当上先进生产者。
    从“连续三个月”到“平均三个月”，从“一个月”到“一着先”，评比条件是步步松，先进生产者数字自然是步步升了。于是，倒好像是先进生产者运动开展得怪深入的。你瞧，先进生产者的队伍不是在“不断扩大”吗？当然，先进生产者队伍的扩大，是先进生产者运动开展得好坏的标志，但并不是最主要的标志；最主要的还是计划完成得好坏。采用降低评比条件的办法，固然可以“扩大先进生产者的队伍”，但并不能有助于完成国家计划。上海市医药公司就是如此。这个公司第二季度先进生产者的人数比第一季度增加了一倍，看来不坏，可是生产任务只完成80％。
    先进生产者的评选标准，如果订得太高，脱离了当前的技术水平，当然会打击群众的热情，应该修订。但是，降低了先进生产者的条件，人为地“扩大先进生产者队伍”，即使“人人先进”了，国家计划却完不成，又有什么好处呢！
