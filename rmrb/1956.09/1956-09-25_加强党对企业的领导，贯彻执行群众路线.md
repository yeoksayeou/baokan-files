Comrade Li Xuefeng, Minister of the Industrial and Transportation Work Department of the CPC Central Committee, spoke as follows:

    I fully agree with the reports made by Comrades Liu Shaoqi, Deng Xiaoping, and Zhou Enlai. I would now like to express some opinions on the work of the Party in state-owned industrial enterprises.

    Under the correct leadership of the Party, state-owned industrial enterprises in our country have achieved great successes in the past few years. However, because the large-scale management of modernized industrial enterprises only began after the victory of the revolution, many shortcomings and errors have arisen. Among them, a noteworthy and serious issue is the growth of a tendency to disregard Party leadership and a subjective and bureaucratic style of being divorced from reality and the masses in state-owned industrial enterprises. Therefore, strengthening Party leadership in enterprises and implementing the Party's mass line in enterprise work have become extremely important tasks for improving the work of industrial enterprises.

    Implementing the System of Factory Director (Manager) Responsibility Under the Leadership of the Party Committee

    Regarding the issue of strengthening Party leadership in state-owned industrial enterprises, the Central Committee has decided to implement the system of factory director (manager) responsibility under the leadership of the Party committee, which is a leadership system that combines the collective leadership of the Party with individual responsibility. This leadership system was determined after summarizing the experiences and lessons learned from the Party's work in various aspects of enterprises over the past few years. During the economic recovery period in our country, the restoration of production and democratic reform in state-owned industrial enterprises were generally carried out under the unified leadership of local Party committees. At that time, the leadership of enterprises basically adopted a system that combined the collective leadership of the Party with individual responsibility. Although this system also experienced deviations in implementation, such as the Party committee taking over administrative work and causing some confusion in production management, from an overall perspective, it still brought into play the Party's leadership role in enterprises and ensured the successful completion of various tasks at that time. Since the implementation of the First Five-Year Plan in 1953, various regions and industrial departments have successively promoted the "one-chief system" in order to rectify the production order of enterprises and improve their management. The promotion of this "one-chief system" has had some success in overcoming the phenomenon of no one being responsible for production management and in establishing a responsibility system. However, due to the erroneous emphasis on the administrative head of the enterprise as the enterprise's leader with full authority, with the Party organization's responsibility for production and administrative work being limited to ensuring and supervising, and with the enterprise's administrative leaders being able to refuse to implement the Party organization's resolutions on production and administrative work when disagreements arose with the Party committee, the administrative leadership of the enterprise was in practice placed in opposition to the Party leadership, negating the Party organization's leadership over the enterprise's production and administrative work and placing the Party organization in a subordinate position. All enterprises that implemented this "one-chief system" blurred, to varying degrees, the understanding of Party members and the masses regarding the Party's leadership role, eroded the Party spirit of cadres, especially some cadres in charge of administrative leadership work, greatly raised the level of bureaucracy and commandism, and fostered capitalist management thinking, leading to increasing arrogance, complacency, and dictatorial work styles. The phenomena of buck-passing, estrangement, and disunity among leading cadres, between cadres and the masses, and among enterprises also increased. Naturally, under these circumstances, these enterprises could not do good work. However, on the other hand, even during this period of promoting the so-called "one-chief system," many enterprises, due to their leading cadres maintaining the fine traditions developed by our Party in the long revolutionary struggle and adhering to the principle of combining the Party's collective leadership with individual responsibility in their actual work, managed their enterprises relatively well and created some good experiences in how the Party should lead enterprises. The effective experiences of these enterprises were that major issues in the enterprise, including production and administrative work, were fully discussed at Party committee meetings, relying on collective experience and wisdom to make decisions, and then the enterprise's administrative leaders were responsible for organizing and implementing them in accordance with the principle of individual responsibility. As for routine administrative affairs and technical work, the enterprise's administrative leaders were solely responsible for handling them independently, and the Party organization not only did not interfere but also provided support in all aspects. Urgent issues that needed to be decided quickly were also handled by the enterprise's leading comrades, with the Party committee providing support. In these enterprises, because the Party's leadership role was brought into play relatively correctly, it was possible to combine individual experience and wisdom with collective experience and wisdom, thus ensuring that enterprise leaders made few or no mistakes when making major decisions, and even if mistakes were made, they were relatively easy to correct. At the same time, because the Party's political work among the masses was able to turn the Party's decisions into the conscious actions of the masses, the orders of the enterprise's administrative leaders could be implemented relatively smoothly, and they had relatively high prestige among the masses, which better realized centralized command in production management and established efficient production management work.

    Since the so-called "one-chief system" has already produced serious consequences in our industrial enterprises, and adhering to the principle of combining the Party's collective leadership with individual responsibility has already achieved good results, why are some comrades still insisting on the "one-chief system"? The main reason is that these comrades have not summarized the experience of enterprise leadership in a realistic manner, have not comprehensively studied the actual situation in enterprises, but have one-sidedly emphasized the characteristics of industrial production requiring centralized management, mechanically believing that if the factory director is to be responsible, the factory director must have "full authority" and can disobey the decisions of the Party committee, and that if the Party committee's collective leadership is implemented, it will inevitably fall into "all-inclusive leadership" and undermine individual responsibility. This is to oppose collective leadership to individual responsibility, and to confuse individual responsibility with individual dictatorship. At the same time, these comrades have also ignored the effective historical experiences of our Party in leading all aspects of work, especially failing to fully consider the successful experience of the system of division of labor and responsibility under the leadership of the Party committee implemented by our Party in the army. From the perspective of ideology and methodology, this is a mistake of subjectivism – mainly dogmatism. I believe that reviewing the path our Party has taken in learning to manage modernized industrial enterprises and explaining to the vast number of cadres the experiences and lessons learned by the Party in determining the enterprise leadership system is very necessary for correctly implementing the system of factory director responsibility under the leadership of the Party committee.

    The Leadership of the Enterprise Party Committee Must Be Built on the Foundation of the Mass Line

    The collective leadership of the Party committee must be built on the foundation of the mass line; it must combine the experience and wisdom of the leading personnel with the experience and wisdom of the broad masses. If we deviate from the mass line, we cannot maintain correct leadership, and we cannot overcome subjectivism and bureaucracy. Therefore, while implementing the system of factory director responsibility under the leadership of the Party committee, we must pay special attention to promoting the tradition of the Party's mass line and criticizing and correcting subjective and bureaucratic work styles.

    The issue of implementing the mass line in industrial enterprises is a fundamental issue related to mobilizing all positive factors in the enterprise, promoting the enthusiasm and creativity of the workers, and ensuring the comprehensive completion of the state plan. Our enterprise Party organizations and all enterprise leading cadres must establish the viewpoint of believing in and relying on the masses in all enterprise work; they must clarify the idea that being responsible to the state and being responsible to the masses are consistent; they must care about the lives and thoughts of the masses, be good at guiding the masses to care about their own initiatives and production results; they must be good at unifying the viewpoint of educating the masses and learning from the masses, and be good at concentrating the correct opinions and advanced experiences of the masses and returning them to the masses to universally improve the production practice of all workers. Only in this way can we cultivate the workers into a fighting force with political awareness and production knowledge, and without such a force, it is impossible to smoothly achieve the country's socialist industrialization.

    Many enterprise leading comrades have already explored some experiences in implementing the mass line, but many cadres have, to varying degrees, blurred or violated the Party's mass line and fostered a bureaucratic work style. They one-sidedly emphasize top-down management, one-sidedly emphasize administrative orders, and do not attach importance to relying on the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, and do not attach importance to the criticisms and suggestions of the workers on production management work. The enterprise's production plans are concocted behind closed doors by only a few people, without in-depth investigation and research, and without the participation of the workers, resulting in being either too conservative or too rash. The implementation of the plan is also purely reliant on administrative orders, without paying attention to carrying out political and ideological work among the masses. The rationalization proposals and advanced experiences of workers in production technology are not valued, not supported, and not helped to be organized for implementation and promotion, and some even stipulate many tedious procedures to restrict them. Workers' congresses and workers' representative conferences are originally the best forms for promoting democracy in enterprises, but they often become meetings where leaders assign tasks and the masses make guarantees. Enterprise leaders rarely engage in self-criticism at such meetings, and even less attention is paid to mobilizing the masses to carry out bottom-up criticism. Workers describe such meetings as "factory director reports, Party committee instructs, trade union calls, and the masses guarantee." Some enterprise leaders do not rely on the method of combining persuasion and education with strict administrative discipline to mobilize workers to consciously execute orders and abide by discipline, but often simply use punishment to maintain discipline, and even wrongly establish penalties and arbitrarily formulate regulations. Some responsible cadres of enterprise Party organizations and trade unions also adopt various coercive or disguised coercive methods to force workers to participate in various amateur activities. What is even more serious is that many enterprise leading cadres do not approach the masses, do not care about the pain and needs of the workers, and do not pay attention to solving the urgent problems in the lives of the workers that can be solved, which has seriously affected the relationship between the Party and the masses, and has affected the production enthusiasm and the improvement of the cultural and technical level of the workers. All of this cannot but arouse the serious vigilance of our Party.

    Our comrades are originally familiar with the Party's mass line leadership method, so why can't they conscientiously implement it in enterprise leadership work, but instead develop bureaucracy? I think that, in addition to various objective reasons, in most cases, it is mainly because these comrades lack a clear and comprehensive understanding of the relatively complex new thing of enterprise management, or their understanding is biased or wrong. We know that the management principle of socialist enterprises is the opposite of capitalism; it must be to establish highly centralized management on the basis of a high degree of democracy. Because only a high degree of democracy can bring into play the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, and only on the basis of gathering wisdom and fully mobilizing the enthusiasm of the masses can we achieve a high degree of centralization. But some of our comrades only see that modern industrial enterprises are highly precise production organizations, only emphasizing the aspect that highly centralized management must be implemented, while neglecting the equally important aspect of democratization in enterprise management, and thus do not pay attention to the leadership method of the mass line. Socialist enterprises must not only rely on all the achievements of science and technology, and conscientiously implement practical technical regulations and management systems, but also attach importance to all the beneficial initiatives put forward by workers from production practice to improve production technology and labor organization. Science and technology and rules and regulations are used to guide and organize the production activities of the masses, but in the final analysis, they are the result of summarizing, concentrating, and improving the production practice of the masses; the production experience of the masses is precisely the most important source of continuously improving technology, improving management, and exploring production potential. Some of our comrades attach importance to science and technology and rules and regulations, which is completely correct, but if this develops into not attaching importance to the experience and initiatives of the workers, then it is wrong. Socialist enterprises require people to cherish machines, give full play to the potential of machinery and equipment, and ensure the completion of state production tasks. But at the same time, they also require a high degree of concern for the people who use and master machines for production, require great attention to giving play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the workers who have become masters of the country, and require the unification of these two aspects. But some of our comrades only value production tasks and machines, and do not value or do not fully value the workers who are engaged in selfless labor to produce material wealth, and do not care about or do not fully care about the material lives of the masses and their cultural and technical learning, so the enterprise's production tasks are not completed well, and the work becomes increasingly passive. All of this is a kind of subjectivism and one-sidedness.

    In our industrial enterprises, not only have there already been successful experiences in combining the Party's collective leadership with individual responsibility, but there have also been successful experiences in the leadership method of the mass line. For example, in terms of compiling production plans, enterprises with better work all go through a process of repeated study with the masses before the leadership discusses and decides on a plan. Generally speaking, the leadership first analyzes and studies existing materials, estimates production potential, finds weak links in production, and proposes preliminary economic and technical indicators and specific measures as a draft plan, which is then handed over to the workers to organize serious discussions, so that research and comprehensive balance is carried out from top to bottom and from bottom to top, level by level, before the plan is finally determined. That is to say, the formulation of the plan is based on the control figures issued by the state, but it also comes from reality and from the masses. Many facts have proved that plans formulated in this way are always more advanced and more reliable. As for adopting the mass line method in the implementation of the plan, turning the plan into the actual actions of the masses through meticulous mass work, and ensuring the comprehensive completion and overfulfillment of the plan, many vivid examples can be cited in the advanced producer movement currently unfolding in enterprises across the country. Many examples prove that if the mass line method is not adopted, the plan cannot be completed, and even if it is barely completed temporarily, it is impossible to maintain it regularly and stably. Let's take the enterprise's technical work as an example. On the surface, it seems that the leadership method of the mass line is not easy to apply. However, in reality, it is not so. All enterprises that have done relatively good production technology work pay great attention to: on the one hand, carrying out a rationalization proposal movement among the workers, discovering and summarizing the advanced experiences of the workers, in order to improve production technology; on the other hand, mobilizing technical personnel to carry out scientific research work, learning and promoting the advanced experiences of the Soviet Union, and organizing technical personnel and workers to maintain close contact, learn from each other, and improve together, relying on everyone to use their hands and brains to solve various technical problems in production. In these enterprises, not only is full ideological and political work carried out when implementing the rules and regulations of production technology work, so that the workers can consciously and willingly abide by them, but also, when formulating and revising the rules and regulations, attention is paid to relying on the cooperation of technical personnel and workers, concentrating the excellent experiences of the workers in actual operation, and incorporating them into the rules and regulations. It can be seen from this that it is entirely possible and absolutely necessary to follow the mass line in planning and technical work. It is completely wrong to think that the Party's mass line cannot be implemented because of the special conditions of modern industrial enterprises.

    Improving the Enterprise's Democratic System

    To overcome the subjective and bureaucratic work style in enterprise leadership and implement the Party's mass line, we must not only continuously summarize the experience in leadership methods and work methods, but also take appropriate improvement measures in the enterprise's current democratic system. I think that we can consider changing the current enterprise workers' representative conference, which is chaired by the trade union, into a workers' representative assembly, adopting a fixed representative system, re-elected once a year, with the representatives being responsible to the workers who elected them. At the regularly convened enterprise workers' congresses and workers' representative assemblies, workers should be guaranteed the necessary time and other conditions to carry out unreserved criticism of all aspects of the enterprise's work and actively put forward various suggestions, in order to bring into play the workers' supervisory role over the enterprise's leadership and guide the workers to actively participate in the enterprise's management. The resolutions passed by the workers' congress and the workers' representative assembly that need to be executed by the administrative leaders should be adopted and executed without reservation by the administrative leaders, as long as they do not conflict with the orders and instructions of the higher leading organs. If there are indeed difficulties in implementation, a responsible explanation should be given to all workers or the workers' representative assembly, and the higher leading organs should be reported; if problems are found in the orders and instructions of the higher levels that are not in line with reality, the higher levels should also be reported and requested to correct them. For administrative leaders who consistently disregard the opinions of the workers, do not implement the resolutions of the assembly, and violate the collective contract, the workers' congress or the workers' representative assembly has the right to suggest that the higher leading organs take appropriate action, up to suggesting the revocation of their positions.

    Whether it is possible to guarantee the full promotion of democracy and the implementation of the Party's mass line in all aspects of the enterprise's work depends on strengthening the leadership of the enterprise Party committee and bringing into play the role of all Party members in the enterprise's work. In order to achieve this goal, we must strengthen the Party's ideological work and intra-Party education, and, in accordance with the Central Committee's instructions on adjusting enterprise leading cadres, make appropriate adjustments to some unqualified full-time Party affairs cadres. At the same time, we must invigorate intra-Party democratic life, conscientiously carry out criticism and self-criticism, in order to strengthen the sense of responsibility of Party members and the masses for the enterprise's work, and improve their enthusiasm for uniting and educating the workers. At present, the number of Party members in enterprises has generally reached 10% to 20% of the total number of workers, and most of the cadres are Party members. According to the system determined by the Central Committee, the Party organization is responsible for leading all aspects of the enterprise's work. Under these conditions, if intra-Party democratic life is invigorated and intra-Party education and the Party's contact with the masses are strengthened, it will be easier to overcome or reduce the subjective and bureaucratic work style in enterprise leadership.

    Improving the Leadership Work of National Industrial Management Departments and Local Party Committees Over Enterprises

    The various errors and shortcomings in enterprise leadership mentioned above are clearly inseparable from the errors and shortcomings of our higher Party and government leading organs. To improve enterprise leadership, we must improve and strengthen the leadership work of the national industrial management departments and local Party committees over enterprises. Here, I only want to talk about the issue of higher Party and government leading organs facing enterprises. Our industrial enterprises are in the front line of the struggle to realize national industrialization. It is not easy to truly manage a complex enterprise well and to make our enterprise leading cadres truly master the art of leadership. We must not simply blame them, but should look for reasons more from the shortcomings of our leadership work. Under the circumstances that our country's current planning work and various systems are not yet perfect, they often encounter various difficulties in their work, some of which cannot be solved without the timely assistance of higher leading organs, but our higher Party and government leading organs have in the past done very untimely and very insufficient work in helping enterprises solve specific difficulties. Higher Party and government leading organs should clearly establish the viewpoint of serving enterprises, and adopt more methods of "going down to the lower levels, officials becoming soldiers" and "individual guidance, promoting the general," giving enterprises specific guidance and help, breaking the current situation of generalized leadership, numerous meetings, impractical orders and instructions, and some rules and regulations hindering work; in particular, it is necessary to quickly overcome the work style of unclear responsibilities of leading organs, mutual shirking of responsibility, and procrastination in handling affairs. Some comrades below have become unbearable of this work style, for example, they describe the situation when asking the higher national industrial organs for instructions: "Entering the office building takes three hours, going around and around, but still no result!" This profoundly reflects their distress in their work and is also a sharp criticism of the leading organs. Whether it is the national industrial departments or the local Party committees, they should all take this as a warning, take effective steps to earnestly improve their leadership work, and work together with all working comrades in the enterprise to strive to raise the work of our country's industrial enterprises to a new level in the next few years.

    加强党对企业的领导，贯彻执行群众路线
    中共中央工业交通工作部部长　李雪峰同志的发言
    我完全同意刘少奇同志、邓小平同志和周恩来同志所作的报告。我现在就党在国营工业企业中的工作问题发表一些意见。
    我国国营工业企业的工作，在党的正确领导下，几年来取得了很大的成绩。但是，由于大规模的管理现代化的工业企业是在革命胜利以后才开始的一项新的工作，因而也产生过许多缺点和犯过一些错误。其中，值得严重注意的是在国营工业企业中，滋长了一种忽视党的领导的倾向和脱离实际、脱离群众的主观主义和官僚主义作风。因此加强党对企业的领导和在企业工作中贯彻执行党的群众路线就成为当前改善工业企业工作的一项十分重要的任务。
    实行党委领导下的厂长负责制
    关于加强党对国营工业企业的领导问题，中央已经决定在企业中实行党委领导下的厂长（经理）负责制，也就是党的集体领导和个人负责相结合的领导制度。这个领导制度，是总结了几年来党在企业各方面工作中的经验教训才确定下来的。在我国经济恢复时期，国营工业企业的恢复生产和民主改革工作，一般是在地方党委的统一领导下进行的。当时对企业的领导，基本上采取了党的集体领导和个人负责相结合的制度。这种制度，虽然在执行中也曾经发生过党委包办代替行政工作的偏差，在生产管理上造成了一些混乱现象，但从总的方面来看，还是发挥了党在企业中的领导作用，保证了当时各项工作任务的胜利完成的。从一九五三年执行第一个五年计划开始，各地区和各工业部门，为了整顿企业的生产秩序，改进企业的管理工作，先后推行了一长制。这种一长制的推行，就其克服生产管理上无人负责现象，建立责任制度方面来说，是有一定的成效的；但是由于错误地强调了企业行政负责人是企业的全权领导者，企业党组织对生产行政工作的职责只能是保证和监督，企业行政领导者在和党委发生意见分歧的时候可以不执行党组织关于生产行政工作所做的决议，因而就在实际上把企业的行政领导与党的领导对立起来，否定了企业党组织对于企业生产行政工作的领导，使党组织处于从属的地位。凡是实行这种一长制的企业，都程度不同地模糊了党员和群众对党的领导作用的认识，侵蚀了干部特别是某些负责行政领导工作的干部的党性，使官僚主义和命令主义大大抬头，资本主义经营思想随着滋长起来，骄傲自满情绪和独断专行的作风也日益发展，而领导干部之间，干部和群众之间，企业相互之间，扯皮、隔阂和不团结的现象也增多起来了。自然在这种情况下，这些企业的工作是做不好的。但是，另一方面，就在推行所谓一长制的这个期间，也有不少企业，由于领导干部保持了我们党在长期革命斗争中发展起来的优良传统，在实际工作中坚持了党的集体领导和个人负责相结合的原则，就把企业办得比较好，也创造出了党如何领导企业的一些良好经验。这些企业行之有效的经验是，企业中的重大问题，包括生产行政工作在内，都在党委会上进行充分的讨论，依靠集体的经验和智慧，做出决定，然后，由企业行政领导同志按照个人负责的原则，负责组织执行。至于日常行政事务和技术工作，则一概由企业行政领导同志独立负责处理，党组织不仅不加干涉，并且从各方面给以支持。紧急的问题需要当机立断，迅速处理的，也由企业领导同志负责处理，党委给以支持。在这些企业中由于比较正确地发挥了党的领导作用，能够把个人的经验智慧同集体的经验智慧结合起来，因而就保证了企业领导者在决定重大问题的时候不犯或者少犯错误，即或犯了错误，也比较容易纠正。同时，又由于党在群众中的政治工作，能够把党的决定变为群众的自觉行动，所以企业行政领导者的命令就能比较顺利地执行，他们在群众中也比较有威信，这样就更好的实现了生产管理上的集中指挥，建立了有效率的生产管理工作。
    既然所谓一长制的做法在我们的工业企业中已经产生了严重的后果，而坚持党的集体领导与个人负责相结合的原则又已经取得良好的经验，为什么还有些同志总是坚持一长制的主张呢？主要的是由于这些同志没有实事求是地总结企业领导的经验，没有全面地研究企业中的实际情况，而是片面地强调工业生产要求集中管理这一方面的特点，机械地认为既要厂长负责，厂长就必须要有“全权”，就可以不服从党委的决定，如果实行党委集体领导，就必然陷于“一揽子领导”，而破坏个人负责。这是把集体领导与个人负责对立起来，而又把个人负责同个人独裁混同起来了。同时，这些同志也忽视了我们党在领导各方面工作中行之有效的历史经验，特别是没有充分考虑我们党在军队中所实行的党委集体领导下的首长分工负责制的成功的经验。从思想方法上说来，这是一种主观主义——主要的是教条主义的错误。我认为，回顾一下我们党学习管理现代化工业企业所走过的道路，向广大干部说明党在确定企业领导制度过程中所取得的经验教训，对于正确贯彻党委领导下的厂长负责制是很有必要的。
    企业党委的领导必须建筑在群众路线的基础上
    党委的集体领导必须建筑在群众路线的基础上，必须把领导人员的经验和智慧同广大群众的经验和智慧结合起来。如果离开了群众路线，就不能保持正确的领导，就不能克服主观主义和官僚主义。因此在贯彻执行党委领导下的厂长负责制的同时，必须特别注意发扬党的群众路线的传统，批判和纠正主观主义、官僚主义作风。
    在工业企业中贯彻执行群众路线的问题，是有关调动企业中一切积极因素，发扬职工群众的积极性和创造性，保证全面完成国家计划的一个根本性的问题。我们企业的党组织和所有企业领导干部必须在全部企业工作中确立相信群众和依靠群众的观点；必须把对国家负责和对群众负责是一致的这种思想明确起来；必须关怀群众的生活和思想，善于引导群众关心他们自己的创议和生产成果；必须善于把教育群众和向群众学习的观点统一起来，善于把群众的正确意见和先进经验集中起来，又返回到群众中去普遍提高全体职工群众的生产实践。只有这样，我们才能把职工群众培养成为一支具有政治觉悟和生产知识的战斗队伍，而没有这样的队伍，要顺利实现国家的社会主义工业化是不可能的。
    我们已经有许多企业领导同志，摸索到执行群众路线的一些经验，但是也有不少的干部在不同程度上模糊了或者违背了党的群众路线而滋长了官僚主义的作风。他们片面强调自上而下的管理，片面强调行政命令，不重视依靠群众的积极性和创造性，不重视职工群众对生产管理工作的批评和建议。企业的生产计划，只依靠少数人闭门编造，不深入进行调查研究，不吸收职工群众参加，结果不是偏于保守，就是流于冒进。计划的执行，也是单纯地依靠行政命令，不注意在群众中进行政治思想工作。对职工在生产技术方面的合理化建议和先进经验，不重视，不支持，不去帮助组织实现和推广，有的甚至规定许多烦琐的手续，加以限制。职工大会和职工代表会议，本来是企业中发扬民主最好的形式，但是往往变成领导布置任务、群众提出保证的会议，企业领导者很少在这样的会议上进行自我批评，更不注意发动群众开展自下而上的批评。职工群众形容这样的会议是“厂长报告、党委指示、工会号召、群众保证”。有些企业领导者，不是依靠说服教育和严肃行政纪律相结合的办法，发动职工群众自觉地执行命令和遵守纪律，而往往是单纯地用处分的办法维护纪律，甚至错误地擅立罚规，乱订章程。有些企业的党组织和工会的负责干部，也采用各种强迫的或者变相强迫的办法，迫使职工群众参加各种业余活动。更严重的是不少企业领导干部，不去接近群众，不关怀职工群众的痛痒，不注意解决职工群众生活中迫切需要解决而又可能解决的问题，以致严重地影响了党和群众的关系，影响了职工群众的生产积极性和文化技术水平的提高。所有这些，不能不引起我们党的严重警惕。
    党的群众路线的领导方法，我们的同志本来是熟悉的，为什么在企业领导工作中不能认真执行反而发展了官僚主义呢？我以为，除了种种客观原因以外，在大多数情况下，主要地是因为这些同志对企业管理这样比较复杂的新事物缺乏清楚的全面的认识，或者是认识上有偏差、有错误。我们知道，社会主义企业的管理原则与资本主义相反，必须是把高度集中的管理建立在高度的民主的基础上。因为只有高度的民主才能把群众的积极性和创造性发扬起来，才能在集思广益和充分发动群众积极性的基础上，达到高度的集中。但是我们有些同志只看到现代化工业企业是一个高度严密的生产组织，只强调必须实行高度集中管理的这一方面，而忽视在企业管理上同样重要的民主化的另一方面，因而就不注意群众路线的领导方法了。社会主义的企业，不但必须依靠科学技术的一切成果，认真推行切合实际的技术规程和管理制度，而且必须重视职工群众从生产实践中所提出来的改进生产技术和劳动组织的一切有益倡议。科学技术和规章制度是用来指导和组织群众的生产活动的，可是归根结蒂说来，它又是总结、集中和提高群众生产实践的结果；群众的生产经验，正是不断提高技术，改进管理，发掘生产潜力的最重要的源泉。我们有些同志重视科学技术和规章制度，这是完全正确的，但是由此发展到不重视职工群众的经验和倡议，那就是错误的了。社会主义企业，要求人们爱护机器，充分发挥机器设备的潜力，保证国家生产任务的完成。但是同时，也要求高度关怀使用和掌握机器来进行生产的人，要求十分注意发挥做了国家主人翁的职工群众的积极性和创造性，要求把这两方面统一起来。而我们有些同志却只是重视生产任务，重视机器，而不重视或者不十分重视为生产物质财富而进行忘我劳动的职工群众，不关心或者不十分关心群众的物质生活和他们的文化技术学习，因而企业的生产任务也完成得不好，工作越来越被动。所有这些，都是一种主观主义、片面性的错误。
    在我们的工业企业中，不仅已经有了成功的党的集体领导和个人负责相结合的成功的经验，而且也有了群众路线的领导方法的成功的经验。例如：拿编制生产计划来说，凡是工作比较好的企业，在领导上讨论定案以前，都要经过一个和群众一起反复研究的过程。大体上是先经过领导上就已有材料进行分析研究，估计生产潜力，寻找生产中的薄弱环节，提出初步的经济技术指标和具体措施，作为计划初稿，然后交给职工群众组织认真的讨论，做到从上至下又从下至上、层层研究和综合平衡，最后才确定下来。这就是说，计划的制定固然是依据国家颁发的控制数字，但同时也是从实际中来和从群众中来的。许多事实证明，这样制定出来的计划，总是比较先进的和比较可靠的。至于在执行计划中采取群众路线的方法，通过细致的群众工作，将计划变为群众的实际行动，保证计划的全面完成和超额完成，这在目前全国各企业中所展开的先进生产者运动里，可以举出许多生动的事例，许多事例证明，如果不采取群众路线方法，计划就不可能完成，即使勉强一时完成了也不可能保持经常稳定的。再拿企业的技术工作来说吧，表面看来，群众路线的领导方法似乎是不容易适用的。但是，实际上也并不如此。凡是生产技术工作做得比较好的企业，他们都十分注意：一方面在职工群众中开展合理化建议运动，发现和总结工人群众中的先进经验，借以改进生产技术；一方面发动技术人员开展科学研究工作，学习和推广苏联的先进经验，并且组织技术人员和工人密切联系，互相学习，共同提高，依靠大家动手动脑来解决生产中的各种技术问题。在这些企业中不仅在贯彻执行生产技术工作的规程和制度的时候，注意进行充分的思想政治工作，做到职工群众能够自觉自愿地遵守，而且在制定和修改规程和制度的时候，也都注意依靠技术人员和工人群众的合作，集中工人群众实际操作中的优良经验，把它们吸收到规程和制度里边去。由此可见，在计划工作和技术工作中走群众路线，也完全是可能的而且是绝对必要的。如果认为由于现代化工业企业的特殊条件就可以不贯彻执行党的群众路线，那是完全错误的。
    改进企业的民主制度
    要克服企业领导上的主观主义和官僚主义作风，贯彻执行党的群众路线，不但必须不断地总结领导方法、工作方法方面的经验，而且还应该在企业现行的民主制度方面，采取适当的改进措施。我觉得，可以考虑将现行的由工会主持的企业职工代表会议改为职工代表大会，采取固定代表制，一年改选一次，代表向选举他们的职工负责。在定期召开的企业职工大会和职工代表大会上，应该保证职工有必要的时间和其他条件，来对企业各方面工作进行无顾虑的批评和积极地提出各种建议，以发挥职工群众对企业领导的监督作用，引导职工积极参加企业的管理。职工大会和职工代表大会所通过的、需要由行政领导者执行的决议，只要和上级领导机关的命令指示不相抵触，行政领导者应当无保留地采纳执行。如果执行确有困难，应当向全体职工或职工代表大会作负责的交代，并且报告上级领导机关；如果发现上级的命令指示有不合实际的问题。也应当报告上级请求改正。对于一贯漠视职工群众意见，不执行大会决议和违反集体合同的行政领导者，职工大会或职工代表大会有权建议上级领导机关加以适当的处理，直至建议撤销他的职务。
    能否在企业的各方面工作中保证充分地发扬民主，贯彻执行党的群众路线，决定的环节是加强企业党委的领导和发挥全体党员在企业工作中的作用。为了达到这个目的，必须加强党的思想工作和党内教育，并且根据中央关于调整企业领导干部的指示，将一部分不称职的专职党务干部做适当的调整。同时必须活跃党内民主生活，认真开展批评和自我批评，以加强党员群众对企业工作的责任感，和提高他们团结教育职工群众的积极性。目前企业中党员数量一般已达到职工总数的百分之十至百分之二十，大部分干部都是党员，按照中央确定的制度，党组织又负担着领导企业各方面工作的责任，在这样条件下，如果党内民主生活活跃起来，党内教育和党与群众的联系加强了，则克服或者减少企业领导上的主观主义、官僚主义作风，就比较容易一些了。
    改善国家工业管理部门和地方党委对企业的领导工作
    前面说到的企业领导工作上的各种错误和缺点，很明显，有许多都是和我们上级党政领导机关的错误和缺点分不开的。要改进企业领导，就必须改善和加强国家工业管理部门和地方党委对于企业的领导工作。这里，我只想讲讲上级党政领导机关应该面向企业的问题。我们的工业企业在实现国家工业化的斗争中处于第一线的地位。要把一个复杂的企业真正管好和使我们的企业领导干部真正掌握领导艺术是不容易的，我们决不能简单地责备他们，而应该更多地从我们领导工作的缺点上找原因。在我国目前计划工作和各种制度还不够完善的情况下，他们在工作中经常碰到各种各样的困难，其中有些不靠上级领导机关的及时帮助，就不能解决，而我们上级党政领导机关，过去在帮助企业解决具体困难上，却是做得很不及时和很不够的。上级党政领导机关应当明确树立为企业服务的观点，更多地采取“上就下，官就兵”和“个别指导，推动一般”的办法，给企业以具体指导和帮助，打破现在领导一般化、会议繁多、命令指示不切实际和部分规章制度妨碍工作的状况；特别是要迅速克服领导机关责任不明，互相推诿，办事拖延不决的作风。对于这种作风，下边同志有些已经到了不可忍耐的地步，例如他们形容到上级国家工业机关请示事情时候的情形说：“进了办公楼，就得三个钟头，转来转去，还是没有头！”这深刻地反映了他们工作中的苦恼，同时也是对领导机关的尖锐批评。不论国家工业部门或者地方党委都应当引为鉴戒，采取有效步骤，切实改善自己的领导工作，并且和企业里一切工作同志在一起，争取在今后几年内能够把我国的工业企业的工作，提高到一个新的水平。
