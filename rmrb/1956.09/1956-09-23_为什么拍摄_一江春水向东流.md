    Why We Filmed "The Spring River Flows East"
    Zheng Junli
    The film "The Spring River Flows East" is meeting audiences again.
    This film was made in 1947; if we count from the day Comrade Cai Chusheng began writing the script (summer of 1946), it has been exactly ten years. Ten years is not too long, but today, when we look back at the suffering people endured at that time through the film, I feel as if life has passed through several generations!
    This film tells the tragedy of a family's evolution twenty years ago – around the time of the War of Resistance Against Japan.
    The great War of Resistance Against Japan brought about earth-shattering changes in the lives of people across the country, but people's experiences differed in different regions: the people in the occupied areas and the Kuomintang-controlled areas lived like beasts of burden under the oppression of the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang reactionaries; the people in the liberated areas, under the leadership of the Communist Party, became masters of their own destiny. The people in the occupied areas desperately hoped for victory, hoped for "daybreak" in the abyss of despair! After a long eight years, "daybreak" finally came, but what awaited them was the disaster of "victory": "Receiving officials" flew in like locusts, clamoring for "five-item success" (gold bars, foreign houses, women, cars, fabrics); traitors transformed themselves into "underground workers" and continued to ride on the backs of the people; American soldiers replaced the Japanese invaders, running rampant, raping and pillaging; finally, the Kuomintang reactionaries simply tore off their masks and launched a full-scale offensive against the liberated areas! The hope for peace that the people of the whole country had held for ten years was completely shattered! At that time, a few folk songs were popular in Shanghai:
    Waiting for dawn,
    Waiting for dawn,
    Dawn has arrived –
    Even more suffering!
    These sixteen short words express the disappointment of the people in the Kuomintang-controlled areas at that time.
    In this atmosphere, we wrote "The Spring River Flows East" with a burning hatred for the Chiang regime.
    In the Kuomintang-controlled areas at that time, it was not without difficulties to make a film with some realistic significance. The first hurdle was the political persecution and film censorship by the reactionaries; secondly, the film had to have a "business eye," otherwise the company would not be able to pay salaries. These problems first weighed on the shoulders of the screenwriters and directors. Therefore, when making this film, we often had to cover up serious content with various protective colors; however, sometimes due to our improper control, some impure impurities or side effects were brought about; sometimes we backfired, making the true meaning obscured by the "false appearance," thus causing confusion and misunderstanding among the audience.
    The Hong Kong "Hua Shang Bao" published a film review entitled "Raging Waves in the Rolling River" (authored by Zi Fu and six others) which touched on this issue:
    "The evaluation of works of art, for the general audience, is often based on concrete images, so the author often suffers for others due to 'unspeakable concealment.' This is the unavoidable pain of conscientious artists at this time and place. In 'The Spring River Flows East,' the most obvious manifestations are as follows: Pang Haogong, as the representative of bureaucratic capital, had to be written as a 'businessman' without roots, making it difficult to see what huge impact he has on the plot of the play; certain agencies full of corruption and bureaucracy had to be written as 'Daxing Trading Company'; Wang Lizhen, a woman who can conjure wind and rain, is sophisticated, and colludes with special missions, had to be written as a demon-like shrewish 'social butterfly', which aroused criticism of 'women causing disasters'; Zhang Zhongmin and his group of comrades, as the progressive and bright side, had to be explained in dark scenes; and after the victory, this group of young people could not appear in the play once. If our guesses are correct, then all these debatable places should not be regarded as the author's distortion or unclear point of view, but should be blamed on the evil of the era in which the author was located, making the author blind and mute. … If the current environment in China releases a little light, then this film will tell us more truth…"
    After "The Spring River Flows East" was screened, there were some debates in the media about what the theme of the film actually expressed. These opinions are helpful in clarifying our creative intentions.
    Some people, considering that this film uses the method of "chronicles" to describe the various aspects of life in several cities and rural areas in the Yangtze River Basin at that time, believe that the author attempted to reflect the entire War of Resistance era. This view is inconsistent with reality. Although there are some fragments in the film that more or less reflect some of the contradictions and struggles in the society at that time, they fail to reflect the whole picture and development of the most important struggles; because it is impossible to reflect these struggles from the protagonists we selected, Zhang Zhongliang (a petty bourgeoisie who defected) and Su Fen (a kind and not very combative urban poor), while the group of Zhang Zhongmin who could undertake this task was forced to retreat to the background of the film. Leaving the main vein of history, we cannot correctly reflect the times.
    Some people believe that the theme of the film is to criticize an intellectual for surrendering and defecting to the environment, and criticize the author for completely attributing Zhang Zhongliang's defection to the environment, while ignoring his own weak side. Others believe that Zhang Zhongliang is an intellectual with a sense of justice, and it is not very based to write him as a traitor later. We had considered these issues before we started writing. We believed that explaining the defection of Zhang Zhongliang, who was originally kind-hearted, as being corrupted by the bad environment in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, could ignite the fire of hatred in millions of viewers at this time and place to attack the current social system. Although the whole play takes Zhongliang's defection as the action thread, it is not the highest task. (To be continued)

    为什么拍摄“一江春水向东流”
    郑君里
    影片“一江春水向东流”又同观众见面了。
    这部影片摄制于1947年；如果从蔡楚生同志动笔写剧本的日子（1946年夏天）算起，到现在恰好整整十年。十年不算太长，可是今天当我们从影片中回顾一下当时人们遭遇的苦难，我觉得生活好像迈过了好几个世代！
    这部影片叙述了二十年前——抗日战争前后一个家庭演变的悲剧。
    伟大的抗日战争在全国人民的生活中掀起了翻天覆地的变化，但在不同的地区里，人们的遭遇却是不同的：沦陷区和国民党统治区的人民在日寇和国民党反动派的压榨下，过着牛马一样的生活；解放区的人民在共产党的领导下翻身作了主人。沦陷区的人们在绝望的深渊中眼巴巴地盼望胜利，盼望“天亮”！经过悠长的八年，好容易“天亮”了，可是等待他们的却是“胜利”的灾难：“接收大员”像蝗虫似地满天飞来，到处闹“五子登科”（金条子、洋房子、女子、车子、衣料子）；汉奸们摇身一变为“地下工作者”，依旧骑在人民头上；美国兵代替了日寇，横行霸道，奸淫掳掠；最后，国民党反动派索性扯下假面具，向解放区发动全面进攻！全国人民十年来抱着的一线不绝如缕的争取和平的希望，到此全归幻灭！当时上海曾流行过几句民谣：
    左等天亮，
    右等天亮，
    天亮到了——
    更加遭殃！
    这简短的十六个字道出了当时国民党统治区人民失望的心情。
    在这种气氛之下，我们怀着对蒋政权烈火一般的仇恨，写下了“一江春水向东流”。
    在当时的国民党统治区里，要摄制一部带有若干现实意义的影片，不是没有困难的。首先横在面前的第一关就是反动派的政治迫害和影片检查；其次，片子必须有“生意眼”，否则公司就发不出薪水。这些难题首先压在编导的肩上。因此在摄制本片时，我们往往只能把严肃的内容用各种保护色掩护起来；但是，有时也由于我们掌握不当，带来了一些不纯的杂质或副作用；有时又弄巧成拙，使真意为“假相”所蔽，因而使观众发生错觉和误解。
    当时香港“华商报”发表的“滚滚江流起怒涛”这篇影评中（作者：梓甫等七人）接触到这个问题：
    “艺术作品的评价，在一般观众来说，往往依据具体形象的，因此作者往往会因‘难言之隐’而代人受过。这是此时此地的有良心的艺术家无可或免的痛苦。在‘一江春水向东流’中，表现得最明显的有如下几点：作为官僚资本的代表人的庞浩公，不得不写成为无根无底的一个‘商人’，似乎很难使人看出他对剧中情节有若何巨大的影响；腐败、官僚气十足的某些机关，不得不写为‘大兴贸易公司’；呼风唤雨、八面玲珑、与特殊任务勾结的女人王丽珍，不得不写成一个妖精泼妇般的‘交际花’，而引起了‘女人祸水论’的批评；作为进步与光明面的张忠民和他的一群战友，不得不用暗场交代；以及在胜利以后，这一群青年无法在剧里出面一次。假如我们的猜测是不错的话，那么这一切可疵议的地方，与其视为作者的歪曲或观点不清，不如归罪于作者所处的时代环境的罪恶，使作者盲和喑了。……假如中国目前的环境放出一点光明，那么这片子一定会告诉我们更多的真实……”。
    “一江春水向东流”映出之后，舆论界对于影片主题究竟表现什么的问题，有过一些争论。这些意见对阐明我们的创作意图是有帮助的。
    有人鉴于本片用“编年史”的方式叙述了当时长江流域几个城市和农村的各种生活面，便认为作者企图反映整个抗战时代。这个看法是与实际不符的。影片中虽有若干片断多多少少反映了当时社会的一些矛盾和斗争，但却未能反映出最主要的斗争的全貌和发展；因为从我们所挑选的主角张忠良（变节的小资产阶级）和素芬（善良而战斗性不强的城市贫民）的身上，不可能反映出这些斗争，而可能承担这一任务的张忠民这一群，却被迫退到影片的后景里去。离开历史的主脉，我们就无法正确地反映时代。
    有一部分人认为影片的主题是批评一个知识分子向环境投降变节，并指摘作者把张忠良的变节完全委过于环境，而忽略他本身软弱的一面。又有人认为张忠良是个有正义感的知识分子，写他后来变成叛徒，并不是太有根据的。对这些问题我们在下笔之前不是没有考虑过。我们以为把原来秉性善良的张忠良的变节，解释为受了国民党统治区的恶劣环境所腐蚀，可以在此时此地燃烧起千百万观众的仇恨之火，去进攻当前的社会制度。全剧虽以忠良变节为动作贯串线，但它并不是最高任务。　（未完）
