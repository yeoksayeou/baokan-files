In many places, the actual situation of agricultural production currently differs greatly from the production plans formulated this spring. How should we treat this actual situation? How should we treat the original production plans?

Some people have adopted the "countermeasure" of simply setting the production plans aside and ignoring them. They believe that since the plan is unrealistic, let it be scrapped!

Some people are in a state of distress. They feel that they had already made big claims, especially after publishing the plans in the newspaper and making grand promises to the commune members. How can they change their words? How can they break their promises? They want to "treat a dead horse as if it were alive" even if the plan is clearly impossible to complete. Therefore, on the one hand, they ask the state for "special" support, and on the other hand, they desperately increase the labor intensity of the commune members and restrict their economic life.

Some people complain about the higher authorities: they shouldn't have vehemently opposed right-leaning conservatism; they shouldn't have failed to allocate "sufficient" machinery, fertilizers, and loans. Some people blame the lower levels: they shouldn't have increased production targets at each level.

How should we view this issue?

Calmly think back. Before this spring, did conservative thinking not exist in agricultural production? The facts in many places now can also prove that conservative thinking did exist at that time; this can be seen by comparing the production targets set by some places at that time with the actual summer harvest this year.

Many production plans that now seem too high were carefully calculated and appeared to be "well-founded" when they were initially formulated. The problem is that it is not very simple or easy to accurately grasp the "basis." At that time, unprecedented prosperity and "miracles" did appear in production activities and many other aspects. Conventions had been broken, and people felt that a new situation had emerged. Due to the lack of new experience under the new circumstances and the lack of scientific knowledge, the "basis" found by some regions was not entirely true and reliable. Therefore, the formulated production plans failed to guide production; in many places, they even played some negative roles: in order to pursue high-yield "miracles," some not-entirely-correct technical measures were prescribed, resulting in some losses; the labor intensity of commune members was excessively increased, affecting their physical health and family life, and more importantly, a lot of sideline production was abandoned, resulting in more harm than good.

However, no one can deny that the plans of many agricultural production cooperatives were well-formulated and played a significant role. Encouraged by the production plans, unprecedented achievements were made in accumulating fertilizer and building water conservancy projects (although there were also many shortcomings in these areas). Although many agricultural cooperatives did not complete their production plans, they did increase production compared to previous years, and some agricultural production cooperatives greatly increased the yield of some crops.

After more than half a year of practice, many cadres and farmers have gained a lot of knowledge, and their abilities, experience, and knowledge are much richer than in the past. Now, when formulating production plans again, they will definitely be much more realistic.

The question facing people is how to deal with the unrealistic plans of the past.

Do not easily abandon the plan. We should quickly check the actual production situation and compare it with the original plan. As long as the harvest has not yet taken place, as long as the measures prescribed in the plan are still feasible, they should be done well. If the plan does not specify concrete measures for the later management of crops, a plan to strengthen later field management should be supplemented according to the possible conditions and crop growth. In many areas in the south, we can revise or supplement the autumn and winter production plans in a practical way. Disaster-stricken areas should develop self-help plans based on the new situation after the disaster. For crops that are about to be harvested soon, we should also formulate autumn harvest plans (plans for allocating labor, animal power, farm tools, and careful harvesting). The yield plan should also be revised realistically after checking the production situation.

What is the use of setting yield targets now? It is useful. First, it lets commune members know how much more they can harvest by strengthening later management and careful harvesting, by exerting their efforts, compared to not doing so. Second, it is necessary to develop a more realistic distribution plan based on the yield plan. Third, with a more accurate yield plan, we can revise the production contract scheme and implement the overproduction reward system more correctly. These three aspects are closely related to improving the enthusiasm of commune members.

The revision and supplementation of the sideline production part of the production plan is even more important. The main defect of the production plans formulated by many agricultural production cooperatives this spring was the neglect of sideline production plans. Recently, many cooperatives have paid attention to sideline production, but the sideline production of some cooperatives is still blind and lacks comprehensive planning. Therefore, human, material, and financial resources still cannot be used correctly, and the situation of operating sideline businesses at a loss and relaxing agricultural production has occurred in some places. To avoid this, a comprehensive production plan must be formulated.

In revising the production plan, what cannot be achieved must be removed, what can be done must be insisted on, and what can be increased must be added. After the test of practice, it is inevitable that the plan needs to be modified. The main purpose of making a plan is to guide production activities, and it can also inspire production enthusiasm.

One of the important reasons why past plans were unrealistic was that a few cadres made them behind closed doors, without mobilizing the masses to participate in the planning activities. In the process of revising or supplementing the plan, of course, this mistake cannot be repeated. Only by treating the process of revising or supplementing the production plan as a process of mobilizing the masses to check production and promote mass wisdom can the revised or supplemented plan play its due role.

Should the long-term plan be revised? If, based on one year of practice, it can be judged that some of the long-term plan is unrealistic, it should of course be revised. However, in order to concentrate efforts on current production activities, the revision of the long-term plan can be postponed until agricultural activities are less tight.

### 还要不要计划

    还要不要计划
    在很多地方，目前农业生产的实际情况同今年春天制定的生产计划有许多出入。怎样对待这个实际情况呢？怎样对待原定的生产计划呢？
    有些人采取的“对策”是：把生产计划干脆摆在一边，不再理会它。他们认为：计划既然不切实际，就让它作废吧！
    有些人陷入一种苦恼的境地。他们觉得：当初已经说了大话，特别是已经把计划登了报，对社员们也许下了宏愿，怎好改口？怎好失信？明明已经不可能完成的计划，他们还要“死马当做活马医”。因此，他们一方面要求国家对他们“特别”支援，一方面拚命加强社员的劳动强度，限制社员的经济生活。
    有些人埋怨上级：不该一股劲地反对右倾保守主义；不该不拨给“足够的”机械、肥料、贷款。有些人责怪下级：不该一级比一级加大生产指标。
    究竟应该怎样看待这个问题？
    平心静气地回想一下，今年春天以前，在农业生产方面，难道没有存在过保守思想吗？现在许多地方的事实也可以证明，保守思想在当时的的确确是存在的；把那时候有些地方规定的生产指标同今年夏季收获的实际情况比较一下，就可以知道了。
    许多现在看来过高的生产计划，在当初制定的时候是经过反复计算，看起来“有根有据”的。问题在于，要确确实实地掌握住“根据”，并不是十分简单容易的事。当时，在生产活动上以至别的许多方面，的确出现了空前未有的盛况和“奇迹”。常规已经被打破了，人们都感觉到新的局面出现了。由于缺乏新情况下的新经验，缺乏科学知识，有些地区找到的“根据”并不是完全真正可以作为根据的。因此，制定出来的生产计划未能起指导生产的作用；在不少地方，它还起了一些不好的作用：为了追求高产量的“奇迹”，规定了一些不完全正确的技术措施，反而造成了一些损失；过分提高了社员的劳动强度，影响了社员的身体健康和家常生活，更重要的是丢掉了不少副业生产，得不偿失。
    但是，谁也不能否认，有许多农业生产合作社的计划却订得很好，起了很大作用。在生产计划的鼓舞下，积肥料和修水利做出了空前的成绩（虽然在这些方面也有不少缺点）。不少农业社的生产计划虽然没有完成，但比起往年来的确是增产了，有些农业生产合作社的有些作物大大增产了。
    经过大半年的实践，许多干部和农民群众长了不少见识，他们的能力、经验、知识已经比过去丰富得多了。现在，再来制定生产计划，就一定会切实得多。
    摆在人们面前的问题是究竟怎样对待过去订的不切实际的计划。
    不要把计划轻易放弃。应该赶快检查一下生产的实际情况，同原定的计划对照一下看看。只要还没有收割，只要计划中规定的措施还有可行的，就该把它做好。计划中对农作物的后期管理没有规定具体措施的，应当根据可能的条件和作物生长的情况，补订加强后期田间管理的计划。南方许多地区，更可以切实地修订或补订秋冬生产计划。受灾地区更应该根据灾后的新情况制定生产自救计划。对于很快就要收获的作物，也要订出秋收计划（调配劳力、畜力、农具和精收细打的计划）。产量计划也应该在检查生产情况以后实事求是地加以修订。
    现在订产量计划还有什么用处呢？有用处。第一，可以让社员们知道，经过加强后期管理和精收细打，尽了力量，比不在这些方面尽力还能多收获多少；第二，需要根据产量计划拟定比较切实的分配方案；第三，有了比较准确的产量计划才可以比较正确地修订包产方案、执行超产奖励制度。这三方面，同提高社员的劳动积极性又都是有密切关系的。
    生产计划中的副业生产部分的修订和补订更加重要。今春各地许多农业生产合作社制定的生产计划的最主要的缺陷就是忽略了副业生产计划。近来不少合作社已经注意了副业生产，可是有些合作社的副业生产仍然是盲目的，仍然缺乏全面规划。因此，人力、物力、财力仍然不能正确地使用，经营副业亏本和放松农业生产的情况在一些地方已经发生。要避免发生这种情况，就不能不把全面的生产计划订好。
    在修订生产计划中，不可能实现的一定要去掉，可能做到的一定要坚持，可能增加的一定要加上。经过实践的考验，计划需要修改，这是难免的事。订计划的主要目的是指导生产活动，它也可以鼓舞生产热情。
    过去计划订得不切实际，重要原因之一是少数干部关门订的，没有发动群众参加订计划的活动。在修订或补订计划当中，当然不可再重复这个错误了。只有把修订或补订生产计划的过程当作发动群众检查生产和发扬群众智慧的过程，才能使修订或补订的计划起它应有的作用。
    长期的规划要不要修订？如果根据一年的实践已经可以判断长期的规划中有些不切实际，当然就要修订。不过，为了集中力量在当前的生产活动上，长期的规划的修订可以等到农事活动不太紧的时候再说。
