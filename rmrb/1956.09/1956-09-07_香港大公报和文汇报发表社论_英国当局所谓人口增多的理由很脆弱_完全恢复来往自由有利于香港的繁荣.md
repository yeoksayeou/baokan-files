Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, September 6th. Hong Kong's "Ta Kung Pao" and "Wen Wei Po" today published editorials on the issue of the so-called "inflow-outflow balance" implemented by the British authorities in Hong Kong. This is the second time these two newspapers have commented on this issue.

    The Ta Kung Pao editorial pointed out that the so-called "population increase" reason put forward by the Hong Kong British authorities when implementing the "inflow-outflow balance" restriction is very weak. Since February, as many as 300,000 people have returned from Hong Kong to the mainland. These people travel back and forth in batches, and some of them often stay in the mainland. In other words, while Hong Kong has increased some of its population from the mainland, some of its original population has also left Hong Kong. The actual population pressure on Hong Kong is therefore very limited. As for the problems of "water" and "housing," these are long-standing social problems in Hong Kong and should not be blamed on mainland residents coming to Hong Kong. This is an extremely simple principle. The editorial calls on the Hong Kong British authorities to immediately abolish this restriction, engage in consultations, and achieve direct train service to facilitate Hong Kong residents and promote relations between the two places.

    The Wen Wei Po editorial said that the number of people traveling between Hong Kong and the mainland is affected by seasonal factors, and it should not and cannot be forced to balance. If more people from the mainland enter Hong Kong for a time, it is also a temporary phenomenon, and this phenomenon is precisely the result of the Hong Kong British authorities' long-term restriction on the freedom of Chinese people to enter and leave Hong Kong. If that unreasonable entry restriction is permanently abolished, then the temporary abnormal situation will not occur. The editorial hopes that the Hong Kong British authorities will respect the traditional rights of the Chinese people to enter and leave Hong Kong for hundreds of years, fully restore freedom of movement, and enable the early realization of direct passenger train service between Guangzhou and Kowloon. This will not only facilitate the travel of compatriots in the mainland and Hong Kong, but also benefit Hong Kong's prosperity.

    香港大公报和文汇报发表社论
    英国当局所谓人口增多的理由很脆弱  完全恢复来往自由有利于香港的繁荣
    新华社广州6日电　香港“大公报”和“文汇报”今天分别就香港英国当局实施所谓“出入平衡”问题发表社论，这是这两家报纸第二次就这个问题发表评论。
    大公报的社论指出，香港英国当局在实施“出入平衡”限制时提出的所谓“人口增多”的理由是很脆弱的。自2月以来，由香港返内地的人达三十万之多，这些人分批往来，经常有一部分停留在内地。换言之，当香港增加了一些由内地来的人口的同时，也有一部分原有人口离开了香港，实际加于香港的人口压力就有限得很。至于“食水”、“居住”等问题，是香港久已存在的社会问题，决不应由内地来港者代负其责，这是极为浅显的道理。社论要求香港英国当局立刻撤销这种限制，从事协商，实现直接通车，以便利香港居民，促进两地的关系。
    文汇报的社论说，香港和内地来往人数的多少是受到季节性的影响的，不应也不可能强求其平衡。如果内地人民进入香港一时显得较多，也是一种临时的现象，而这种现象正是香港英国当局长期限制中国人自由进出香港的结果。假如永远取消那种不合理的入境限制，那么暂时的不正常情况就不会出现。社论希望香港英国当局尊重中国人民百年来进出香港的传统权益，完全恢复来往自由，并且使广九直接通客车早日实现，这样，不仅使内地和香港同胞来往便利，也有利于香港的繁荣。
