Xinhua News Agency, 8th: Kuala Lumpur Dispatch: The Chief Minister of the Federation of Malaya, Rahman, said on September 3rd, "The Federation government cannot defeat the Malayan Communist Party with real guns and bullets."

Rahman, while giving a report to a "civic training class" composed of people from various new villages in Cameron Highlands, also said, "I don't understand why the Emergency continues to drag on. It should have ended long ago, but there is still no sign of it ending. Its continued existence will cost the Federation money that could be used to improve the lives of the people."

However, Rahman also believes that the "Emergency" can only end if residents stop supplying food to the Malayan Communist Party-led National Liberation Army. He asked the villagers of the new villages to "assist" the government and not provide food to the National Liberation Army.

    马来亚首席部长承认无法打败马共
    新华社8日讯　吉隆坡消息：马来亚联合邦首席部长拉赫曼9月3日说：“联合邦政府无法用真枪实弹的战争打败马来亚共产党”。
    拉赫曼在一个由来自金马仑各新村的人组成的“公民训练班”上作报告时还说，“我不明白为什么紧急状态竟会继续拖下去。它老早就应该结束，但是目前仍无结束的迹象。它的继续存在将花费联合邦可以用来改善人民生活的金钱”。
    但是，拉赫曼又认为，只要居民停止向马来亚共产党领导的民族解放军供应粮食，“紧急状态”才可能结束。他要求新村村民“协助”政府，不要以粮食接济民族解放军。
