Xinhua News Agency, 11th - Tokyo dispatch: More than 1,000 citizens of all classes in Tokyo held a meeting yesterday, demanding that the Japan-Soviet negotiations reach an agreement immediately.

Representatives from various circles, including Heino Yoshitaro, Secretary-General of the Japan Peace Committee, Yasui Iku, Secretary-General of the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, Inamura Akemi, Vice-Chairman of the Tokyo Regional Council of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, and Majima Takeshi, Secretary-General of the National Council for the Restoration of Japan-China and Japan-Soviet Diplomatic Relations, addressed the masses at the meeting, unanimously emphasizing that the Japan-Soviet negotiations must succeed immediately.

Sata Tadataka, Director of the International Bureau of the Japan Socialist Party, said: The Socialist Party believes that the immediate restoration of diplomatic relations between Japan and the Soviet Union is the most important thing, and this is the best opportunity for Japan to break away from leaning towards the United States and to gain autonomy and independence. Sata also said: All Japanese people, including the government, various parties, and people of all classes, should work together to realize the restoration of diplomatic relations between Japan and the Soviet Union.

Xinhua News Agency, 10th - Tokyo dispatch: U.S. Ambassador to Japan, Allison, warned Japan today to be "careful" in its negotiations with the Soviet Union.

Allison visited Japanese Foreign Minister Shigemitsu Aoi this afternoon, expressing the U.S. government's attitude towards the Japan-Soviet negotiations to him.

According to Kyodo News, Allison also suggested that "the Japan-Soviet negotiations should take more time." He pointed out that no matter what method is finally adopted to restore normal relations between Japan and the Soviet Union, the Japanese side needs to "carefully study" it.

Shigemitsu held a press conference after meeting with Allison. Shigemitsu revealed that Allison indicated that the United States supports Japan's territorial claims. Allison also used the words "the Soviet Union may change its attitude in the process of continuing negotiations" to instigate Japan to insist on the territorial claims that have already created obstacles to the negotiations.

Asanuma Inejiro, Secretary-General of the Japan Socialist Party, issued a statement today in response to Allison's activities, accusing the U.S. government of interfering in Japan's internal affairs. He believes that the United States clearly does not welcome the restoration of diplomatic relations between Japan and the Soviet Union. He said that the Japan-Soviet negotiations have reached this stage, and the Hatoyama government should move forward with a firm attitude to bring the negotiations to a victorious conclusion.

    东京各阶层市民举行大会
    要求日苏谈判立即达成协议
    美驻日大使访重光公开阻挠日苏谈判
    新华社11日讯　东京消息：东京各阶层市民一千多人昨天举行大会，要求立即使日苏谈判达成协议。
    日本和平委员会书记长平野义太郎、日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会事务总长安井郁、日本工会总评议会东京地方评议会副议长稻村明善和日本恢复日中日苏邦交国民会议事务总长马岛僴等各界代表在会上向群众演讲，一致强调必须立即使日苏谈判获得成功。
    日本社会党国际局长佐多忠隆说：社会党认为立即恢复日苏两国邦交是最重要的事，这是日本脱离向美国一边倒的状态和获得自主独立的一个最好的机会。佐多还说：全日本国民，包括政府、各党派、各阶层人民，应该一致为实现恢复日苏邦交而努力。
    新华社10日讯　东京消息：美国驻日本大使艾利逊今天警告日本在同苏联谈判中要“小心”。
    艾利逊在今天下午访问了日本外务相重光葵，向他表明了美国政府对日苏谈判的态度。
    据共同社报道，艾利逊同时也建议，“日苏谈判应该多费些时间来进行”。他指出，不管最后采取甚么方式恢复日苏正常关系，日本方面都需要“慎重研究”。
    重光在同艾利逊会谈后举行了记者招待会。重光透露，艾利逊表明美国支持日本的领土要求。艾利逊并且用“在继续谈判的过程中苏联可能改变态度”这样的话，来唆使日本坚持已经对谈判造成障碍的领土要求。
    日本社会党总书记浅沼稻次郎今天针对艾利逊的活动发表谈话，指责美国政府干涉日本内政。他相信，美国显然不欢迎日本和苏联恢复外交关系。他说，日苏谈判已经达到现在这个阶段，鸠山政府应该以坚定的态度前进，使谈判胜利结束。
