    Where Can Adenauer Not Encounter "Terrible Things"?
　  Shu Wu
    I remember when Adenauer was in Moscow conducting diplomatic negotiations with Soviet state leaders, the Soviet state leaders accused Hitler's fascist troops of many bloody crimes committed on Soviet territory. Adenauer immediately counterattacked, saying that when the Soviet army destroyed Hitler's lair, "many terrible things also happened." This shameless slander was immediately and sternly refuted. Soviet state leaders clearly told him that this was a slander against the honor of the great Soviet army. In his embarrassment, he stated that he did not say the Soviet army, but only that "many terrible things" did indeed "happen" at that time.
    This scene is very interesting. To fabricate rumors to someone's face and be caught red-handed on the spot, why is it that as soon as he makes a speech, people either expect or worry about him making a fool of himself? This can be seen from here.
    However, the fabrication of rumors itself is often precisely a revelation of some true feelings. This time, Adenauer is determined to advance towards Nuremberg, the first step being to illegally declare the German Communist Party "illegal." Therefore, we should admit that when the Soviet army destroyed Hitler's lair, many things that were very terrible for Adenauer and his ilk did indeed happen. Isn't that so? At that time, the German Communist Party acquired open and legal status to carry out its struggle. This was a major event that made Adenauer and his ilk tremble with fear and unease day and night, so he was so frightened that he brought out this desperate and retrogressive trick today.
    Hitler's pre-death wedding in the underground bunker, Himmler's potassium cyanide, the gallows of Nuremberg... further back, there's the corpse of the black-shirted prime minister hanging upside down from a lamppost on a street in Milan. All of this cannot but be "terrible things" for Adenauer and his ilk.
    The statement of the Central Committee of the CPSU on the banning of the German Communist Party points out: "The people of all countries have learned a great deal from the painful experience of the Second World War. The socialist world system has become a powerful and invincible force. The first worker-peasant state in German history—the German Democratic Republic—has been consolidated and is developing victoriously, and is now building socialism." All of this cannot but be "terrible things" for Adenauer and his ilk from the very beginning.
    That's why he said: "Many."
    But that small group of people, living in the land that produced Marx and Engels, Liebknecht and Luxemburg, Goethe and Schiller, Kant and Hegel... living in the world that produced these figures, for them, the whole thing is simply a "terrible thing." What they fear is the whole of Germany, the entire human world. It cannot be said that they are not aware of this. Look, aren't they running forward, their target pointing to the place where their predecessor Hitler has been buried for eleven years? They know that only when they reach that place will they no longer encounter any "terrible things."

    阿登纳在那里才遇不到“可怕的事情”？
　  舒芜
    记得阿登纳在莫斯科同苏联国家领导人进行外交谈判的时候，苏联国家领导人指责了希特勒法西斯军队在苏联国土上所犯的许多血腥的罪恶，阿登纳立刻反攻，说是苏联军队摧毁希特勒巢穴的时候，“也发生了很多可怕的事情”。无耻的诽谤，立刻遭到严正的驳斥，苏联国家领导人明白地告诉了他，这是对于伟大的苏联军队的荣誉的诬蔑。他狼狈之下，声明道：他并没有说苏军，只是说，当时确实“发生了很多可怕的事情”。
    这一幕很有意思。当面造谣，当场出丑，为什么他一演说，听的人就或者期待或者担心他闹笑话，从这里也可见一般了。
    但是，造谣本身，往往正好是某种真情的流露。阿登纳这回决心向纽伦堡前进，第一步是非法地宣布德国共产党为“非法”，于是，我们倒应该承认，苏军摧毁希特勒巢穴的时候，的的确确是发生了许多对于阿登纳之流非常可怕的事情。不是么？当时，德国共产党取得公开合法地位来进行斗争了，这就是使阿登纳之流一直胆战心惊、日夜不安的一件大事，所以吓得他到今天拿出这日暮途穷、倒行逆施的一手来。
    希特勒地下防空洞中的死前婚礼，希姆莱口中的氰化钾，纽伦堡的绞架，……远一点还有米兰街头电线杆上倒吊着的黑衫首相的遗体，这一切，对于阿登纳之流，不能不是“可怕的事情”。
    苏共中央关于德共遭到禁止一事的声明中指出：“各国人民在第二次世界大战的痛苦经验中已经学到了许多东西。社会主义世界体系已经变成一支强大的不可战胜的力量。德国历史上第一次出现的工农国家——德意志民主共和国已经巩固，并且在胜利地发展，现在它正在建设社会主义。”这一切，对于阿登纳之流，更不能不一开始就是“可怕的事情”。
    所以他说：“很多”。
    但是，他们那一小撮人，生活在产生了马克思和恩格斯、李卜克内西和卢森堡、歌德和席勒、康德和黑格尔……的国土上，他们生活在产生了这些人物的世界上，对他们来说，根本整个儿就是一件“可怕的事情”。他们怕的是整个德国，整个人类世界。不能说他们对这一点没有自知。请看，他们不正在跑步前进，目标指向他们的前辈希特勒已经葬身十一年的那个地方么？他们知道，只有到了那个地方，才不会再遇到任何“可怕的事情”。
