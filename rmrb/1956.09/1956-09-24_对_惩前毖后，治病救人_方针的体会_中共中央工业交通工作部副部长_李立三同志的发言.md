A major development in the construction of a Marxist-Leninist party is the "curing the sickness to save the patient" policy adopted by our Party in correcting the mistakes of Party members—the petty-bourgeoisie's inherent weaknesses are the root of all mistakes—the poison of subjectivism and sectarianism—the great historical significance of the Yan'an Rectification Movement—only by not "shying away from medical treatment" and honestly examining one's mistakes, can one raise one's understanding of Marxism-Leninism and correct those mistakes.

From the Seventh National Congress to the Eighth National Congress, our Party led the people of the whole country in completely accomplishing the democratic revolution and basically realizing the socialist revolution, achieving a great victory of historical significance in the world communist movement. This is because, after the Zunyi Conference in 1935, our Party, under the leadership of the Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, established a correct political line in the continuous struggle to overcome "left" and right opportunism, and established a correct organizational line in the continuous struggle to overcome various forms of sectarianism, thereby uniting the whole Party and the people of the whole country to advance from victory to victory. The ideological foundation of this correct political and organizational line is the principle that the Central Committee has always adhered to: combining the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolutionary struggle. As Comrade Liu Shaoqi said in his political report: "The Party Central Committee has also systematically helped cadres throughout the Party to gradually understand the principle of combining Marxist-Leninist theory with practice, and to understand the principle that our subjective understanding must conform to objective reality." To this end, "Seven years after the Zunyi Conference, the Party Central Committee launched the famous 'Rectification Movement' throughout the Party against subjectivism, sectarianism, and stereotyped Party writing, organizing cadres throughout the Party to examine their thoughts and work in detail from the standpoint, viewpoint, and method of Marxism-Leninism, to examine the Party's ideological, political, and organizational leadership, and to conduct profound criticism and self-criticism." At the same time, "For any comrades who made mistakes in their work due to errors in understanding, the Party resolutely implemented the principles of 'learning from past mistakes to avoid future ones, curing the sickness to save the patient' and 'clarifying thinking and uniting comrades'."

From the lessons of my own mistakes, I deeply realize the correctness and greatness of our Party's policy. As everyone knows, I was the person in charge of the Second "Left" opportunist line—the Li Lisan line—and an active participant in the First "Left" opportunist line. The Sixth National Congress of the Party explicitly criticized the errors of the First "Left" opportunism, pointing out that blind actionism, military adventurism, and commandism were the most major dangers within the Party. Why did I relapse into these errors not long after the Sixth National Congress, and develop them to a more serious degree? The most important reason here is that, although I verbally admitted the errors of blind actionism at the time, I did not carry out any ideological liquidation. I only negated some obvious manifestations of error, but I did not and did not know how to use the Marxist-Leninist standpoint, viewpoint, and method to deeply analyze the essence and ideological roots of the error. As a result, the inherent weaknesses of the petty-bourgeoisie, which were deeply rooted in me, and the subjectivist way of thinking that stemmed from them, which was detached from reality and detached from the masses, did not change in the slightest. When this petty-bourgeois inferiority met with an improved revolutionary environment, it once again erupted into a more severe "revolutionary" mania. At the same time, the subjective thinking that was not based on seeking truth from facts but was self-righteous became even more rampant.

This rampant subjectivism manifested itself politically in blindly relying on momentary enthusiasm, treating subjective fantasies as reality, issuing orders arbitrarily without any forethought or humility. Looking back at the reckless, desperate approach at that time, regardless of the circumstances, regardless of the conditions, in the cities where the enemy's white terror rule was strongest, instead of carrying out arduous mass work to accumulate revolutionary strength little by little, we constantly called for strikes and demonstrations, and constantly organized riots; in the countryside, instead of using all our strength to launch the land revolution struggle and guerrilla warfare of the peasant masses and gradually establish revolutionary base areas, we ordered the revolutionary army, which was still very young at the time, to constantly attack the central cities; and after repeatedly hitting our heads against the wall, we still did not know how to turn back, but desperately continued to work hard, causing great losses to the revolutionary forces. The virus of subjectivism made people so foolish to such an unimaginable degree.

This rampant subjectivism manifested itself organizationally as a strong sectarianism, which not only failed to listen to others' opinions with a calm head, but also arbitrarily labeled comrades with different opinions as opportunists and conciliators, and excluded and attacked them, creating an extremely abnormal state within the Party, and even causing some excellent cadres to suffer sacrifice. For example, the sacrifice of Comrade Yun Daiying makes me feel very sad every time I think about it. Comrade Yun Daiying was working in the Central Propaganda Department at the time, and because he had repeatedly expressed his disagreement with the adventurist approach at the time, he was labeled with the idea of conciliationism, transferred him out of the central organs, and sent him to be the secretary of the Hudong District Committee. He was one of the targets of the enemy's search and arrest, was not familiar with the situation in Hudong, and was very near-sighted. When the police raided the area, he was caught and imprisoned, and later betrayed and sacrificed. This shows that this sectarian cadre policy is not only a serious political error, but also a criminal act against the revolution.

I just want to give one or two examples here to illustrate the poisonous development of subjectivism and sectarianism during the Li Lisan line period, not to elaborate on the many practices that actually harmed the revolution during the Li Lisan line period, nor to explain the absurd so-called "viewpoints" and "theories" of the Li Lisan line, because this is familiar to many comrades. As for the ideological, historical, and social roots of the errors of the Li Lisan line, the "Resolution on Certain Historical Issues" adopted by the Seventh Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee of the Party in 1945 made a very clear analysis and criticism, and I completely agree with and support this resolution. This is a document that summarizes the historical experience of our Party and makes a significant contribution to the Marxist-Leninist treasure house. It is the crystallization of the great Marxist-Leninist ideological movement of the Yan'an Rectification. I was unable to participate in the Yan'an Rectification Movement and the Seventh National Congress of the Party, and I still dare not say that I have a truly deep understanding and appreciation of this document, and I still need to study it carefully.

I began to admit the errors I realized at the time at the Third Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee in June 1930, and I did indeed make up my mind to correct the errors at that time. However, almost twenty years later, in the work of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions in 1950, I repeated the serious errors of a subjectivist nature. The main reason here is that I had not conducted in-depth and arduous ideological liquidation for a long time. Although I had read some Marxist-Leninist books, I did not know how to connect them with my own errors and the lessons learned from my work, so my ideological understanding did not improve at all. However, I should say that during the Wang Ming line period, the vicious sectarianism and patriarchal system, which adopted the method of "cruel struggle" and "ruthless blow" against comrades who made mistakes, not only could not help comrades who made mistakes to truly recognize and correct their mistakes, but also made these comrades often feel spiritually oppressed and unable to breathe. Not to mention, under the Wang Ming line, which was "more resolute, more 'theoretical,' more arrogant, and more complete in form than the 'Left' leaning of the Li Lisan line" (see "Resolution on Certain Historical Issues"), it was of course impossible to help me liquidate the ideological roots of the Li Lisan line errors. I worked under the direct leadership of Comrade Wang Ming for seven years, as if I had lived the life of a young daughter-in-law for seven years, being frightened and cautious all day long to avoid offending him, but I was still often reprimanded. Under these circumstances, I exposed another weakness of my petty-bourgeoisie—weakness. At that time, I disagreed with many of Comrade Wang Ming's erroneous remarks and behaviors. Although I did not go so far as to blindly obey and echo him, I also showed a serious weakness in not daring to firmly resist and defend the interests of the Party even on major principled issues.

In the years that followed, after greater difficulties, at the end of 1945, I suddenly received a notice saying that I had been elected as a member of the Central Committee. This completely unexpected event, of course, gave me great encouragement, but I had no idea what was going on? It was not until I returned to Harbin in early 1946 that I first read the "Resolution on Certain Historical Issues," first read the documents of the Yan'an Rectification, and first read some of Comrade Mao Zedong's important works. For me, who had been away from the practical struggle of the Chinese revolution for fifteen years, this was truly a Marxist-Leninist enlightenment education. It was only at this time that I first saw the term "the principle of combining the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolutionary struggle," and I realized that Comrade Mao Zedong had created and stipulated a complete set of political, economic, and military strategies and tactics for our Party to lead the Chinese revolution based on this principle, and I realized that during the Yan'an Rectification period, Comrade Mao Zedong had profoundly and sharply criticized the poison of subjectivism and sectarianism based on this principle, and stipulated a complete set of guidelines and lines for opposing erroneous tendencies within the Party, such as "learning from past mistakes to avoid future ones, curing the sickness to save the patient" and "clarifying thinking and uniting comrades." Especially when I heard that Comrade Mao Zedong had put forward "Nine Guidelines" during the Yan'an cadre review period, and compared them with my own experiences, I deeply felt how important the role of the helmsman was in the giant wave of the revolutionary movement, and how important the role of the leader was. All of this, for comrades, has been deeply experienced from the practice of revolutionary struggle; for me, it is like a "country bumpkin entering the city," only feeling "a dazzling array of beautiful things." However, it is impossible to deeply understand the meaning of beauty and the truth of beauty all at once. Therefore, a party member like me, in terms of party seniority, can be said to be "old qualifications," but in terms of revolutionary thought, knowledge, and experience, I am really very naive. After reading these documents and works, I knew that the root of my mistake was subjectivism. At that time, I also made up my mind to eradicate this problem and strive to study the spirit of "proceeding from reality in everything" and "seeking truth from facts" to carry out my work. However, subjectivism, that is, the monster of idealistic methodology, cannot be eliminated by swearing to eradicate it, nor can it be driven away by issuing a ban or drawing a talisman. When you have not invited a good doctor to inject you with enough antitoxin, when your understanding of Marxism-Leninism has not been raised to a sufficient level, this problem of subjectivism will recur when it encounters appropriate conditions.

The errors I made in the work of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions were precisely the recurrence of this problem of subjectivism. I cannot but thank the Party for performing a good operation on me. When the Central Committee discovered my mistake, it carried out timely exposure, sharp criticism, and raised it to the height of Marxist-Leninist principles to expose the essence of the mistake and criticize its harmfulness. Such a loud shout, "You are sick!" helped me to wake up more quickly and not fall into deeper demonic diseases. More importantly, precisely because of this, comrades throughout the Party learned about the seriousness of this mistake, raised their understanding, and resolutely fought against the influence of the mistake, making it easier to stop the development of the mistake's influence and prevent the cause of the Party from suffering more harm. In the process of examining my own mistakes and after reviewing my mistakes, the Central Committee and many responsible comrades cared for me like doctors caring for patients, and gave me the opportunity to correct my mistakes in my work. Many comrades I came into contact with not only did not discriminate against me, but also gave me a lot of comradely help, comfort, and encouragement. I deeply felt the warmth of this comradeship. Such care and warmth is just like tonic after illness, enabling me to recover my health and working ability more quickly. This mistake of mine made me make up for the lesson of the Yan'an Rectification, which was very beneficial to me. Later, in the struggle against the Gao-Rao anti-Party alliance at the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee in 1954, I received another profound education. However, I dare not say that the root of my illness has been completely eliminated, let alone that I have completely corrected my mistakes and will not make any more mistakes in the future. If I am not vigilant, not humble and cautious, not diligently striving to learn, and not earnestly abandoning the habit of self-righteousness, arrogance, and complacency, and truly learn the style of seeking truth from facts, especially if there is no constant supervision and education from the Party, it is entirely possible to repeat mistakes. Because this petty-bourgeois inferiority is really like wild grass, "wildfires cannot burn it out, the spring breeze blows it back to life." I hope that comrades will give me strict supervision and more help in my future work at any time. From the lessons of my own mistakes, I have gained a basic understanding that if I do not honestly examine my mistakes, they will become an ideological burden and I may fall into greater and deeper mistakes. At the same time, after making mistakes, I have not lost the confidence that a communist party member should have—confidence in the cause of communism—and therefore I have been able to maintain my enthusiasm for working for the Party. This may be one of the reasons why I have not been discouraged, pessimistic, or unwilling to seek medical treatment after making several serious mistakes, and why I have been able to earnestly examine my own mistakes and strive to correct them. I am willing to continue to work and study hard under the guidance of the Party, under the supervision and help of comrades, learn from comrades, learn from the masses, overcome my long-standing serious weaknesses of being detached from the masses and detached from reality, overcome my petty-bourgeois inferiority, and strive to finally correct my mistakes in practice, not just in words. From the lessons of my own mistakes, I have deeply realized that the complete set of "curing the sickness to save the patient" methods adopted by our Party in correcting errors within the Party, from performing surgery to appropriate post-operative care, enables our Party to not only constantly overcome various errors, large and small, but also to timely rescue comrades who have made mistakes (if the comrades who have made mistakes do not "shy away from medical treatment"), to not only constantly overcome internal contradictions, but also not to harm the unity of the Party, and to further enhance the unity of the Party. This is a major development of Marxism-Leninism in the construction of the Party.
    
I fully agree with Comrade Mao Zedong's opening speech, Comrade Liu Shaoqi's political report, Comrade Deng Xiaoping's report on revising the Party Constitution, and Comrade Zhou Enlai's report on the proposal for the Second Five-Year Plan. I believe that by implementing the guidelines, lines, and practices put forward in the opening speech and reports, our Party will be able to better unite its own ranks, unite the working class, unite the people of the whole country, and unite all forces that can be united internationally to complete the historical task of building a great socialist China.

    对“惩前毖后，治病救人”方针的体会
    中共中央工业交通工作部副部长　李立三同志的发言
    党在纠正党员的错误方面所采取的“治病救人”的方针是在马克思列宁主义党的建设问题上的一个重大的发展——小资产阶级的劣根性是一切错误的根源——主观主义和宗派主义的毒害——延安整风运动的伟大历史意义——只有不“讳疾忌医”，老实检查自己的错误，提高对马克思列宁主义的认识，才能改正错误。
    在第七次代表大会到第八次代表大会期间，我们党领导全国人民彻底完成了民主革命，又在基本上实现了社会主义革命，取得了在世界共产主义运动中有历史意义的伟大胜利。这是由于我们党在一九三五年的遵义会议以后，在以毛泽东同志为首的中央领导下，在不断克服“左”的和右的机会主义斗争中确立了一条正确的政治路线，在不断克服各种各样的宗派主义斗争中确立了一条正确的组织路线，因而能够团结全党，团结全国人民，从胜利走向胜利。这个正确的政治路线和正确的组织路线的思想基础，就是中央始终坚持的马克思列宁主义的普遍真理和中国革命斗争的具体实践相结合的原则。正如刘少奇同志的政治报告中所说：“党中央又系统地帮助全党干部逐步地了解马克思列宁主义的理论和实际相结合的原理，了解我们的主观认识必须符合于客观实际的原理。”为此，“党中央曾经在遵义会议的七年以后，在全党发动了反对主观主义、宗派主义和党八股的著名的‘整风运动’，组织全党干部在这个运动中，按照马克思列宁主义的立场、观点、方法详细地检查自己的思想和工作，检查党在思想上、政治上和组织上的领导，展开深刻的批评和自我批评。”同时，“对于任何由于认识上有错误而在工作上犯错误的同志，党都坚决地执行了‘惩前毖后，治病救人’，‘既要弄清思想，又要团结同志’的原则”。
    我从自己所犯错误的教训中，深深体会到我们党的这个方针的正确和伟大。大家知道，我是第二次“左”倾机会主义路线——立三路线错误的负责人，并且是第一次“左”倾机会主义路线的积极参加者。党的六次大会明确批判了第一次“左”倾机会主义的错误，指出了盲动主义、军事冒险主义和命令主义是党内最主要的危险，为什么我在六次大会以后不久又重犯这些错误，并把它发展到更加严重的地步呢？这里最主要的原因，在于当时虽然口头上承认了盲动主义错误，但是，没有进行任何思想清算，只是否定了一些显而易见的错误的表现，并没有而且也不懂得用马克思列宁主义的立场、观点和方法去深刻地分析错误的本质和思想根源，因而在我身上根深蒂固地存在的那种小资产阶级劣根性和由此而来的脱离实际、脱离群众的主观主义的思想方法，没有丝毫改变。这种小资产阶级的劣根性遇到了革命环境好转的时候，就又一次暴发为更厉害的“革命”的狂热病。同时，那种不是实事求是而是自以为是的主观主义思想也就更加猖狂起来了。
    这种猖狂的主观主义表现在政治上，就是单凭一时狂热，把主观的幻想当成现实，毫不思前顾后，毫不谦虚谨慎，就任意发号施令起来。回想当时那种盲目莽撞的拚命主义作法，不管情况如何，不问条件怎样，在敌人白色恐怖统治最强固的城市中，不进行艰苦的群众工作去一点一滴地积聚革命力量，反而不断号召罢工、示威，不断组织暴动；在农村中不用全部力量去开展农民群众的土地革命斗争、游击战争，逐步建立革命根据地，反而命令当时还很幼小的革命军队不断进攻中心城市；并且在一次一次碰得头破血流之后，还不懂得回头，还要拚命地硬干下去，使革命力量受到了很大的损失。主观主义的病毒，竟把人弄得愚蠢到这样不可想像的地步。
    这种猖狂的主观主义表现在组织上，就成为强烈的宗派主义，不仅不能用冷静的头脑倾听别人的意见，而且对于有不同意见的同志，任意扣上机会主义、调和主义的帽子，加以排斥打击，造成了党内极不正常的状态，甚至使一些优秀干部因此遭受牺牲。例如，恽代英同志的牺牲，使我至今每一想起就感觉非常痛心。恽代英同志当时在中央宣传部工作，因为他几次表示不同意当时这种冒险主义的作法，便给他扣上了调和主义思想的帽子，把他调出中央机关，派他作沪东区委书记。他当时是敌人搜捕对象之一，既不熟悉沪东情况，眼睛又非常近视，在巡捕抄把子的时候，被抓住入狱，后来被叛徒告密牺牲了。这表明这种宗派主义的干部政策的作法，不仅是一种严重的政治错误，而且造成了对革命的犯罪行为。
    我这里只是想举一两个例子来说明立三路线时期那种主观主义和宗派主义发展的毒害，不来详细叙述立三路线时期许许多多在事实上危害革命的作法，也不来说明立三路线那种荒谬绝伦的所谓“观点”、“理论”，因为这是许多同志所熟悉的。至于立三路线错误的思想根源、历史根源和社会根源问题，一九四五年党的六届七次中央全会所通过的“关于若干历史问题的决议”作了非常明确的分析和批判，我完全同意和拥护这个决议。这是一个总结我党历史经验，对马克思列宁主义宝库有重大贡献的文件，这是延安整风这个伟大的马克思列宁主义思想运动的结晶。我没有能够参加延安整风运动和党的七次代表大会，至今还不敢说对于这个文件有了真正深刻的了解和体会，还需要好好学习。
    我在一九三○年六届三中全会上已经开始承认了当时所认识到的错误，并且的确当时就下了决心要改正错误。可是，在差不多过了二十年以后，在一九五○年全国总工会工作中又重犯了主观主义性质的严重错误。这里主要的原因，就是自己在长时期中没有进行过深入的、刻苦的思想清算工作。虽然也看过一些马克思列宁主义书籍，却不会联系自己的错误、自己工作中的经验教训来加以思考，因而在思想认识上并没有提高一步。但是，我应当说，在王明路线时期，那种恶劣的宗派主义和家长制，对犯错误的同志一味采取“残酷斗争”、“无情打击”的办法，不仅不能帮助犯错误的同志来真正认识错误，改正错误，而且使这些同志经常感到精神上的压迫，简直舒不过气来。更不用说，在王明路线那种“比立三路线的  ‘左’倾更坚决，更‘有理论’，气焰更盛，形态也更完备”（见“关于若干历史问题的决议”）的情况下，当然无法帮助我来清算立三路线错误的思想根源了。我在王明同志的直接领导下工作了七年，好像是过了七年小媳妇的生活，终日提心吊胆，谨小慎微，以免触怒，但还是不免经常受到斥责。我在这种情况下，又暴露了自己小资产阶级的另一种弱点——软弱性。我当时对王明同志的不少错误的言论和行为是不同意的，虽然没有走到对他完全盲目服从、随声附和的地步，但是也表现了甚至在重大原则问题上也不敢坚决抗争来维护党的利益的严重弱点。
    往后几年，经过更大困难之后，在一九四五年底，忽然接到通知说，我当选做了中央委员。这种完全出乎意外的事情，当然给了我莫大的振奋，但是，完全不知道究竟是怎么一回事？直到一九四六年初回到哈尔滨以后，我才初次读到“关于若干历史问题的决议”，初次读到延安整风文件，初次读到毛泽东同志的一些重要著作。对于我这个离开中国革命实际斗争十五年之久的人来说，这真正是一次马克思列宁主义的启蒙教育。我这时才第一次看到“马克思列宁主义的普遍真理与中国革命斗争的具体实践相结合的原则”这个术语，才知道毛泽东同志根据这个原则创造了并规定了我们党领导中国革命的一整套政治上、经济上、军事上的战略和战术，才知道在延安整风时期，毛泽东同志根据这个原则如何深刻尖锐地批判了主观主义和宗派主义的毒害，并且规定了“惩前毖后，治病救人”，“既要弄清思想，又要团结同志”一整套反对党内错误倾向的方针路线。特别是当我听见说延安审干时期，毛泽东同志提出了“九条方针”以后，拿来和我自己经过的事情一比较，使我深刻感觉到在革命运动的巨潮中掌舵人的作用何等重要，领袖的作用何等重要。所有这一切，对于同志们来说，都是从革命斗争的实践中深切体会到了的；对于我来说，就好像“乡下人进城”一样，只觉得“琳琅满目，美不胜收”。但是，究竟美的意义，美的道理怎样，一下子是无法深刻体会的。所以像我这样一个党员，按党龄来说，可以说是“老资格”了， 但是就革命的思想、知识和经验说，实在幼稚得很。当我读过这些文件和著作以后，知道了我犯错误的根本毛病是主观主义。当时也就下了决心要根绝这个毛病，要努力学习“一切从实际出发”，“实事求是”的精神去进行工作。但是，主观主义，也就是唯心主义思想方法这个怪物，毕竟不是那一个人赌咒发誓根绝它就可以清除得了的，也不是那一个人下一道禁令，或者画一道符籙，可以驱除得了的。当你还没有请到良医给你注射足够的抗毒素的时候，当你对马克思列宁主义的认识还没有提高到足够的程度的时候，这种主观主义的毛病一遇到适当的条件，又会重新发作起来。
    我在全国总工会工作中犯的错误，正是这种主观主义毛病的重新发作。我不能不感谢党给我施了一次良好的手术。当中央发现了我的错误的时候，就进行了及时的揭发，尖锐的批评，提到马克思列宁主义原则高度上来揭发错误的实质，批判错误的危害性，这样大喝一声：“你有病呀”，才帮助我能够较快地觉悟过来，没有陷入到更深的病魔中去。更重要的，正是由于这样，就使全党同志都了解到这个错误的严重性，提高了认识，坚决与错误的影响作斗争，就比较容易地制止了错误影响的发展，使党的事业没有受到更多的危害。在我检查自己错误的过程中及检讨了错误以后，中央和许多负责同志，又像医生护理病人一样地关怀我，并给我以在工作中改正错误的机会。我所接触的许多同志，不但不对我歧视，而且给我以不少的同志的帮助、安慰和鼓励。我是深深感到了这种同志的温暖的。这样的关怀和温暖，正好像病后补药一样，使我能够较快一些恢复健康和工作能力。我的这次错误，使我补上了延安整风的一课，对我是非常有益的。后来在一九五四年七届四中全会反对高、饶反党联盟的斗争中，我又受到了一次深刻的教育。但是，我决不敢说，我的病根已经完全?掉了，更不敢说已经完全改正了错误，以后不会再犯错误了，如果自己不警惕，不谦虚谨慎，不兢兢业业地努力学习，不切实抛弃自以为是，骄傲自满的习气，真正学会实事求是的作风，特别是如果没有党的经常的监督和教育，是完全可能重犯错误的。因为这种小资产阶级的劣根性真好像野草一样，“野火烧不尽，春风吹又生”。希望同志们对我的今后工作随时给以严格的监督和更多的帮助。我从自己犯错误的教训中得到了一点起码的认识，就是如果不老实检查自己的错误，便会成为思想包袱，便有可能陷入到更大更深的错误中去。同时，我在犯过了错误之后，还没有丧失一个共产党员应有的信心——对共产主义事业的信心，因而还能够保持为党工作的积极性，这也许可以说是我在犯了几次严重错误之后，还没有垂头丧气，悲观失望，还能不讳疾忌医，切实检讨自己错误并且力求改正错误的原因之一吧。我愿意在党的教导下，在同志们的监督和帮助下，继续努力工作和学习，向同志们学习，向群众学习，克服自己长期存在的脱离群众、脱离实际的严重弱点，克服自己的小资产阶级的劣根性，求得终于能够在实践中，而不只是在口头上改正自己的错误。我从自己犯错误的教训中，深深体会到我们党在纠正党内错误问题上所采用的从施手术到病后的适当护理这一整套“治病救人”的办法，使我们党既能不断克服各种大大小小的错误，又能及时挽救犯错误的同志（如果犯错误的同志不“讳疾忌医”的话），既能不断克服内部矛盾，又能不损害党的团结，并且更加增强了党的团结，这是马克思列宁主义在党的建设问题上的一个重大的发展。
    我完全同意毛泽东同志的开幕词，刘少奇同志的政治报告，邓小平同志关于修改党的章程的报告，周恩来同志关于第二个五年计划的建议的报告。我相信，贯彻执行开幕词和报告中提出的方针、路线和作法，我们党必能更好地团结自己的队伍，团结工人阶级，团结全国人民，团结国际上一切可能团结的力量，来完成建设一个伟大的社会主义中国的历史任务。
