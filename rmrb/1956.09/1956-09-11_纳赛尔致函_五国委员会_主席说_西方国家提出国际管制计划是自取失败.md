Xinhua News Agency, September 10th dispatch from London: Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser, in a letter to Robert Menzies, chairman of the "Five-Nation Suez Committee," on September 9th, stated that the aim of the international administration plan for the Suez Canal proposed by Western countries is to take the canal away from Egypt. “It is difficult to imagine a greater provocation to the Egyptian people.”

The Australian High Commission in the United Kingdom released Nasser's letter on the evening of September 9th. It released a total of four documents exchanged between Nasser and Menzies in Cairo during their recent talks: a memorandum from the Five-Nation Committee to Nasser on September 3rd, proposing the eighteen-nation plan from the London Conference; a short letter from Menzies to Nasser on September 7th, urging attention to the Spanish proposal at the London Conference; and a long letter from Menzies to Nasser on September 9th, explaining the eighteen-nation plan in detail.

In his lengthy, two-thousand-word letter to Menzies, Nasser pointed out that the system of international administration of the Suez Canal proposed by Western countries "will certainly be regarded by the Egyptian people as hostile and detrimental to their rights and sovereignty." This system would be "collective rule." He said: "Any attempt to forcibly implement such a system will surely be a signal for unpredictable disputes—and will throw the Suez Canal (issue) into political turmoil, never to be divorced from politics as the (Menzies) Committee suggests."

The letter stated that actions of this nature are self-defeating and are of a nature to cause friction, misunderstanding, and constant disputes. In other words, this will not be the end of the dispute, but the beginning.

Nasser said that the Egyptian government has every right to nationalize the Suez Canal Company, and this cannot be seriously disputed. He pointed out that for nearly fifty days, despite the difficulties created by Britain and France and certain elements of the former Suez Canal Company, canal navigation has continued normally and efficiently. Therefore, the crisis and so-called "serious situation" were artificially created by the above-mentioned parties, including issuing statements of military threats, British and French mobilization and troop movements, instigating pilots and other employees to suddenly cease work, and taking hostile economic measures against Egypt.

The letter stated that the Egyptian government has declared its willingness to achieve a peaceful resolution through negotiations based on the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter. Nasser pointed out that Egypt agrees with the eighteen-nation plan's view that resolving the Suez Canal issue must respect Egypt's sovereignty, guarantee freedom of navigation in the canal in accordance with the provisions of the Constantinople Convention, respect Egypt's ownership, and ensure the efficient and reliable operation of the canal, as well as its maintenance and development. Nasser said: "However, when we come to consider the methods recommended by the (Five-Nation) Committee to achieve these goals, we find that these methods are themselves doomed to failure, and they lead to results that are contrary to the original goals."

He said that no matter what the management system of the canal will be, it will always rely on the close, full, and voluntary cooperation of the Egyptian people, because the canal passes through them, through their country. If the Egyptian people consider the administrative body to be hostile, opposed to their sovereignty, their rights, and their dignity, then this indispensable cooperation cannot be obtained.

Nasser said: "I would like to reiterate that the policy of our government remains:

(1) To guarantee freedom of navigation in the Suez Canal and to guarantee the safe use of this canal without any discrimination. (2) To develop the Suez Canal to meet future navigation needs.

(3) To stipulate fair and reasonable tolls and fees. (4) To guarantee the technical efficiency of the Suez Canal."

Nasser's letter concludes by saying that we believe the Suez Canal will therefore be divorced from politics, it will not become a source of war, but will once again become a bond of cooperation, mutual benefit, and further understanding between countries in the world. We believe that if Egypt implements this policy and demonstrates sincerity in all aspects, then it will make the greatest contribution to the welfare and happiness of the world, as well as to the welfare and happiness of Egypt itself.

Menzies said in his letter to Nasser on September 7th that his talks with Nasser "revealed differences in formulation and principle, and it is clear that these differences cannot be changed even with further debate."

In its memorandum to Nasser on September 3rd, the Five-Nation Committee emphasized that the Suez Canal "should be free from political influence" and "there should be a clear system for the operation, maintenance, and development of this canal, which, while recognizing Egypt's sovereignty, simultaneously serves the clear interests of not only Egypt but also all users of this most important waterway for a long period of time to come."

### 纳赛尔致函“五国委员会”主席说  西方国家提出国际管制计划是自取失败

    纳赛尔致函“五国委员会”主席说
    西方国家提出国际管制计划是自取失败
    据新华社10日讯　伦敦消息：埃及总统阿卜杜勒·纳赛尔在9月9日给“五国苏彝士委员会”主席孟席斯的一封信中说，西方国家提出的国际管理苏彝士运河的计划的目的是要把这条运河从埃及手中夺走。“很难想像有比这更大的对埃及人民的挑衅了”。
    澳大利亚驻英国高级专员公署在9月9日晚上公布了纳赛尔的这封信。它一共公布了最近纳赛尔同孟席斯在开罗举行会谈期间交换的四个文件，其他三个文件是：五国委员会在9月3日向纳赛尔提出伦敦会议上的十八国计划的备忘录，孟席斯在9月7日给纳赛尔的促请注意伦敦会议上的西班牙建议的一封短信，以及孟席斯在9月9日给纳赛尔的详细解释十八国计划的一封长信。
    纳赛尔在给孟席斯的长达两千字的信中指出，西方国家提出来的国际管理苏彝士运河的一套制度
  “一定会被埃及人民认为是充满着敌意的，是有损于他们的权利和他们的主权的”。这一制度将是“集体统治”。他说：“硬要实行这样一种制度的任何企图，肯定将成为难以预料的纷争的信号——并将把苏彝士运河（问题）投入到政治的纠纷中去，绝不会像（孟席斯）委员会所说的那样，同政治断绝关系”。
    这封信说，这种性质的行为是自取失败的，同时也是具有引起摩擦、误解和不断纠纷的性质的行动。换句话说，这将不是纠纷的结束，而是纠纷的开始。
    纳赛尔说，埃及政府完全有权把苏彝士运河公司收为国有，这是不可能认真提出争论的。他指出，差不多五十天以来，尽管有英法两国和前苏彝士运河公司某些分子造成的困难，运河的通航一直照常并且有效率。因此危机和所谓“严重情况”是上述各方面人为地制造出来的，这种行为包括发表实行武力威胁的声明，英法动员和调动军队，煽动领航员和其他雇员突然停止工作，对埃及采取敌对的经济措施等。
    这封信说，埃及政府已经宣布愿意根据联合国宪章的宗旨和原则，通过谈判取得和平解决。纳赛尔指出，埃及同意十八国计划中的这种看法：解决苏彝士运河问题，必须尊重埃及的主权，保证符合君士坦丁堡公约规定的运河通航自由，尊重埃及的所有权，并且保证运河的有效的、可靠的经营，以及运河的保养和发展。纳赛尔说：“但是，当我们来考虑（五国）委员会所建议的达到这些目的的方法时，我们发现这些方法，本身就注定了失败，它们引向同原来目的相反的结果”。
    他说，不管管理运河的管理制度将会怎样，它总是要依靠埃及人民的紧密的、充分的和自愿的合作，因为运河是在他们中间、在他们的国家里通过的。假使埃及人民认为管理机构是有敌意的，是同他们的主权、他们的权利和他们的尊严敌对的，那末这种不可或缺的合作就不能得到了。
    纳赛尔说：“我愿意重申：我国政府的政策仍然是：
    （一）保证苏彝士运河的通航自由，保证这条运河的安全使用，而不加任何歧视。（二）发展苏彝士运河以满足将来通航的需要。
  （三）规定公平合理的通行税和费用。（四）保证苏彝士运河的技术效率。”
    纳赛尔的信最后说，我们相信，苏彝士运河将因而同政治断绝关系，它不会成为战争的来源，而再度成为世界上各国之间合作、互惠和进一步了解的纽带。我们相信，如果埃及实行这个政策并在各方面显示诚意的话，那末它就既对世界的福利和幸福、也对埃及本身的福利和幸福作出最大的贡献。
    孟席斯在9月7日给纳赛尔的信中说，他和纳赛尔的会谈“显示了提法上和原则上的分歧，而显然这种分歧即使再来一次辩论也是不能改变的”。
    五国委员会在9月3日致纳赛尔的备忘录中强调苏彝士运河“应该不受政治的影响”，并且“应该有一种关于经营、保养和发展这条运河的明确的制度，这种制度一方面承认埃及的主权，同时在未来长时期内不仅为埃及、而且还为这条最重要的水道的所有的使用者的明显的利益服务”。
