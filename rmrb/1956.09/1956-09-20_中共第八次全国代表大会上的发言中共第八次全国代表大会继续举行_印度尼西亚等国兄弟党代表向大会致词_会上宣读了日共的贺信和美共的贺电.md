The congress continued to discuss the political report made by the Central Committee of the Party to the congress, the report on the revision of the Party Constitution, and the report on the proposal for the Second Five-Year Plan. All the representatives who spoke at today's meeting unanimously endorsed these three reports.

The representatives present warmly welcomed the addresses delivered at the congress today by Lukman, head of the delegation of the Communist Party of Indonesia, Nambudiripad, head of the delegation of the Communist Party of India, Lin Hai, member of the delegation of the Workers' Party of Korea, Hoang Quoc Viet, head of the delegation of the Vietnam Workers' Party, and Vesselinov, head of the delegation of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, and warmly welcomed the message of greetings from the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party and the telegram of greetings from the National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States read at today's meeting. Whenever representatives of fraternal parties began their addresses, finished their addresses, or when the messages of greetings and telegrams of greetings were read, the representatives all stood up and burst into storms of prolonged applause.

Ulanhu (Vice Premier of the State Council, Secretary of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Party Committee) explained in his speech today the work done by the Party in resolving domestic ethnic issues and the shortcomings existing in the current ethnic work.

Comrade Lukman then delivered his speech. He said that the inexhaustible source of strength and creativity of the Chinese Communists lies in trusting the people and trusting the Party. When he said that this understanding also strengthened the confidence of the Communist Party of Indonesia and the Indonesian people, and that they would also achieve new victories in the struggle for complete national independence, democracy and peace, the representatives responded with thunderous applause. Comrade Lukman read to the congress a letter of greetings from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Indonesia signed by Comrade Aidit.

Next, Executive Chairman Huang Jing read to the congress a letter of greetings from the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party. The letter expressed the growing friendship of the Japanese Communist Party and the Japanese people towards the Chinese people, which cannot be stopped by any reactionary force. When the letter stated that the Japanese Communist Party, with the support of the increasingly high tide of mass struggle for national independence and peaceful democracy, had resumed its public activities since last year and was advancing at a new pace, the representatives expressed their respect with warm applause. The letter also expressed the desire of the Japanese people to establish normal diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union and China.

Comrade Nambudiripad said in his speech that the great Lenin once predicted that the unity between the Soviet Union, China and India would be a decisive blow to world imperialism and would be beneficial to world socialism. He expressed that the Indian Communists would make the greatest efforts to realize this legacy of Lenin. The representatives present responded with warm applause.

After his speech, Comrade Nambudiripad presented to the congress a stone carving and a precious Tanjore plate.

Dong Biwu (Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee) delivered a speech on several issues in the Party's leadership of the people's democratic legal system.

Ouyang Qin (First Secretary of the Heilongjiang Provincial Party Committee of the CPC) criticized, in his speech, based on the situation in Heilongjiang Province, the tendency of some units to unilaterally emphasize administrative power and neglect and weaken the leading role of the Party, and analyzed in detail the social roots and causes of this tendency.

Luo Ruiqing (Minister of Public Security) introduced in his speech the main situation of the anti-espionage struggle in our country, and listed facts to illustrate the main experiences gained by the Party in leading the people of the whole country in carrying out the anti-espionage struggle.

Comrade Lin Hai delivered a speech and read the letter of greetings from the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party to the congress. His words, full of the fighting friendship between the people of China and Korea, were interrupted by warm applause many times.

The representatives welcomed Comrade Hoang Quoc Viet's speech and the letter of greetings from the Central Executive Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party signed by Comrade Ho Chi Minh with repeated warm applause. Comrade Hoang Quoc Viet handed over to the presidium of the congress the pennant and gifts presented to the congress by the Central Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party. The pennant read: "Warmly salute the Communist Party of China for achieving greater success in leading the Chinese people in the cause of socialist construction." When the pennant was presented, all the representatives stood up, and prolonged applause resounded once again in the hall.

Comrade Vesselinov said in his speech that the relations between Yugoslavia and China and the relations between the two parties will continue to develop and strengthen. He said that the Yugoslav communists and the various nationalities of Yugoslavia will be delighted by every future achievement of the Communist Party of China, because this will strengthen peace, democracy and socialism in the world. His words were constantly greeted by warm applause from the audience.

Executive Chairman of the Congress, Huang Jing, read out the telegram of greetings from the National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States, jointly signed by Foster and Dennis. The telegram expressed deep regret that the Communist Party of the United States could not send its own delegation to attend this congress due to the Iron Curtain in the United States. The telegram said that despite Wall Street's aggressive policy in the Far East, there is a growing sentiment among the American people for taking steps to ease tensions in the Far East and establish normal relations with the People's Republic of China.

Also speaking at the meeting today were Xu Ming (Chairman of the Tianjin Women's Federation), Zhang Desheng (First Secretary of the Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee of the CPC), and Zashi Wangxu (Vice Governor of Qinghai Province).

Xu Ming talked about the work of Tianjin in dealing with the families of capitalists, explaining that major changes have taken place among bourgeois women.

Zhang Desheng said that in order to improve the thinking of cadres and solve the new problems raised in the agricultural cooperation movement, the Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee is organizing cadres to study the five documents stipulated by the Party Central Committee, such as "Remodeling Our Study", so as to continuously overcome the tendencies of subjectivism, bureaucratism and sectarianism.

Zashi Wangxu talked about the facts and experiences of how the Party's adherence to the policy of striving for, uniting and resettling has stabilized the long-scattered Kazakh tribes, allowing them to live a free and happy life.

Today's meeting ended at 7:10 p.m. The meeting will continue tomorrow.
