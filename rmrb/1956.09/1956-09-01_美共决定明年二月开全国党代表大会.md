Xinhua News Agency, New York, August 30th (TASS dispatch): According to a published announcement, the National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States has decided to hold a National Convention from February 9th to 12th, 1957. The last convention was held in 1950. The announcement stated: "The reason for the long interval between conventions is that many party leaders were arrested under the Smith Act, and party members were subjected to political persecution."

The National Committee also said that a national representative meeting with representatives from various state committees will be held on September 29th and 30th to discuss the tasks facing the party in the election campaign, the issue of Marxist newspapers, and preparations for the convention.

    美共决定明年二月开全国党代表大会
    据新华社31日讯　塔斯社纽约30日讯：据已发表的通告说，美国共产党全国委员会决定在1957年2月9日至12日举行全国党代表大会。上一次代表大会是在1950年举行的。通告中说：“代表大会之所以间隔了这许多年，是由于党的许多领导人被根据史密斯法加以逮捕，由于党员遭到政治迫害。”
    全国委员会还说，在9月29日和30日要举行有各州委员会代表参加的全国代表会议，以讨论党在选举运动中所面临的任务、马克思主义的报刊的问题和筹备代表大会的问题。
