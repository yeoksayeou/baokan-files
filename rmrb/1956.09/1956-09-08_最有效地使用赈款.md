    Using Relief Funds Most Effectively
    He Li
    At the Hebei Province production and disaster relief meeting, some cadres showed a lack of understanding of the power of disaster-stricken people to help themselves through production, and a tendency to rely on the state for everything. In the group discussions of several special districts, this situation could be seen: When many county cadres talked about disaster relief plans, they didn't first say how much grain their county had to support them for how long, what methods they could think of to solve how many problems, and then ask for state assistance. They opened their mouths and said how terrible the situation was, wanting this much and that much. One county was located in an area with developed transportation and many avenues for sideline production, but the cadres of this county said they had "no way out." They planned a disaster relief expenditure of more than 5 million yuan, but only came up with two or three sideline production items with an income of only 300,000 to 400,000 yuan. Some comrades proposed plans at the production and disaster relief meeting that did not look like plans for weathering the famine. They calculated the daily living expenses of each disaster victim according to normal times, and all the collapsed houses had to be rebuilt, requiring the state to subsidize 50 to 60 yuan per house. This is very unrealistic.
    Our country has allocated huge sums of money for emergency relief since the beginning of the floods, and then continuously allocated funds to help people settle down and produce. This shows how deeply the people's country cares about the suffering of the people. However, the leading comrades in the disaster areas should never simply rely on state aid and relax their leadership in helping the disaster victims to help themselves through production. After the flood, everything needs to be rebuilt, and everything needs money. Cadres and the masses should carefully calculate and practice strict economy. When repairing houses, old bricks and waste materials can be used as much as possible, and there is no need to hire too many craftsmen. As long as the masses are mobilized to help each other, many problems can be solved. Some households with few laborers and lonely elderly people have few people and can temporarily not build houses, and temporarily arrange for them to live in houses with more people. In short, everything must be handled simply, in order to make full use of the funds distributed by the state for production and strive to get through the famine as soon as possible.

    最有效地使用赈款
  　贺笠
    在河北省生产救灾会议上，有一些干部表现了对灾民生产自救的力量认识不足，事事都想依靠国家的倾向。在几个专区的小组讨论会上都可以看到这样的情况：许多县的干部谈救灾计划，总不是先说本县现有多少粮食可支持多长时间，自己想些什么办法能够解决多少问题，然后再要求国家援助。他们一开口就说如何不得了，要这个多少，要那个多少。有一个县本来是处在交通发达的地区，副业生产门路很多，而这个县的干部却说“毫无办法”。他自己计划了五百多万元的救灾开支，而只想出了收入只有三几十万元的两三宗副业生产。有些同志在生产救灾会议上提出的计划很不像度荒计划。他们对灾民每人每日的生活费用都是按照正常时候计算，所有倒塌的房屋都要重新修盖，要求国家每间房屋补助五十元至六十元。这是很不实际的。
    我们国家从水灾一开始发生的时候就已拨出巨款进行急赈，随后又陆续拨款帮助人民安家生产。这正表现了人民的国家是多么深切地关心人民的疾苦。但是，灾区的领导同志，决不该单纯依赖国家的援助，而放松领导灾民生产自救。大水之后，百废待举，样样都需要钱。干部和群众都应当精打细算，厉行节约。修房补屋，可以尽量利用旧砖废料，也不必多请工匠，只要发动群众互助，就可以解决不少问题。有些缺乏劳动力的孤寡户，人口少，可以暂不盖房，把他们权且安置到房屋多的人家寄住。总之，一切都要从简办理，为的是充分运用国家发放的资金进行生产，争取早日度过灾荒。
