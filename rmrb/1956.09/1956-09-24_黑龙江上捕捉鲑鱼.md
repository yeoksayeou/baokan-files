Xinhua News Agency, Harbin — On the Heilongjiang and Ussuri Rivers, nearly a thousand fishing boats from fishery production cooperatives are catching salmon day and night. The Jiaojiepai Fishery in Fuyuan caught more than 1,400 fish, totaling over 10,000 jin, in just two days. Large quantities of salmon are sent to processing plants daily, and the work at the processing plants is also very busy.

The first batch of fresh fish that has been packed is being transported to Beijing. This is the first trial transport of fresh salmon since liberation.

Salmon is a valuable fish. In addition to eating the meat, the roe can also be eaten. The roe is shaped like transparent agate beads, as large as soybeans, and has very high nutritional value.

    黑龙江上捕捉鲑鱼
    据新华社哈尔滨讯　黑龙江，乌苏里江江面上，近千只渔业生产合作社的渔船昼夜不停地捕捉鲑鱼。抚远交界牌渔场在两天中就捕了一千四百多尾，计一万多斤。每天都有大量的鲑鱼送往加工场，加工场的工作也很忙碌。
    已装好的第一批鲜鱼，正运往北京，这是解放以后第一次试运鲜鲑鱼。
    鲑鱼是珍贵鱼类，除食肉外，还可食鱼卵，卵形如透明的玛瑙珠子，大如黄豆，营养价值很高。
