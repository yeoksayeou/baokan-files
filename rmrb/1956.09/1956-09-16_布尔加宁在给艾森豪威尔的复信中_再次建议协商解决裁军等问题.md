Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 15th: TASS reported from Moscow on September 14th: On September 11th, the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Bulganin, once again sent a letter to U.S. President Eisenhower regarding issues such as the reduction of armaments, the prohibition of the use and testing of atomic and thermonuclear weapons, and the reunification of Germany. This letter was delivered by the Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Zarubin, to U.S. Secretary of State Dulles on September 13th, requesting him to forward it to the U.S. President.

Bulganin's letter is a response to a letter written to him by Eisenhower on August 4th. In that letter, Eisenhower rejected the suggestions made by Bulganin in his letter of June 6th, namely, that the U.S. government should also contribute to the reduction of armaments, as the Soviet Union had done, without waiting for the signing of an international disarmament agreement. He doubted that such measures "would effectively eliminate fear and the enormous expenditures caused by maintaining national armed forces." He still believes that only the implementation of the U.S.-proposed "aerial inspection" and "exchange of military information" surveillance programs can promote large-scale disarmament.

Regarding Bulganin's proposal to reduce the troop presence of both sides in Germany, Eisenhower said that this issue cannot be viewed in isolation. In this regard, he believes that the issue of restoring German reunification through "free elections," as agreed upon by the four governments present at the Geneva Conference, has not been resolved. Furthermore, he had heard some statements from the Soviet side that "intend to maintain the division of Germany indefinitely." In addition, he once again requested Bulganin to consider another proposal he made in his letter of March 1st this year, namely, to determine a mutually agreed-upon date after which fissionable material should not be used anywhere in the world to manufacture nuclear weapons.

Regarding these issues, Bulganin stated in his reply to Eisenhower that the Soviet government still believes that, under the current international situation, measures taken by individual countries to reduce their own armed forces before countries reach a consensus agreement on the reduction of armaments and armed forces will be of great significance in strengthening international trust. If other countries take similar steps, it will also help countries establish friendly relations and alleviate the doubts and fears that the people of all countries have not yet been able to dispel.

Referring to the "aerial inspection plan" proposed by the United States, Bulganin pointed out that the issue of aerial inspection and aerial photography is unrelated to disarmament. Moreover, if acceptance of the proposal on aerial photography is made a condition for taking any measures in disarmament, then negotiations on disarmament will be deadlocked. Aerial inspection and aerial photography mean that materials concerning the territory of relevant countries, as well as their industrial and other resources, will fall into the hands of other countries. Under the current international situation, this will only increase mutual fear of the danger of surprise attacks and will cause war hysteria.

Bulganin then discussed the issue of disarmament. He said, "I cannot but point out that the Soviet Union has made efforts more than once during the negotiation process, hoping to reach an agreement with Western countries. However, the situation in disarmament negotiations in the United Nations bodies and other international conferences shows that whenever the Soviet Union makes concessions to other negotiating participants and accepts their suggestions in order to reach an agreement on disarmament, these countries will definitely abandon their original suggestions, thereby preventing an agreement on disarmament." The same is true on the issue of banning atomic and hydrogen weapons.

Regarding the issue of banning the manufacture of nuclear weapons, Bulganin said that the Soviet Union has pointed out that banning the manufacture of atomic weapons without prohibiting the use of such weapons or removing them from national armaments can never solve the problem of eliminating the danger of atomic war. Moreover, this approach would actually mean legitimizing these weapons of mass destruction, which hundreds of millions of people are increasingly resolutely demanding to be unconditionally banned.

Bulganin hoped that Eisenhower would pay attention to the issue of stopping the testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons. He said that current scientific and technological conditions have made it possible to detect any explosion of an atomic or hydrogen bomb. Therefore, stopping the testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons does not require any international agreement on surveillance. Due to this situation, it is now possible to separate this issue from the overall issue of disarmament and address it separately. Reaching an agreement on this issue among countries would be an important first step towards the unconditional prohibition of this type of weapon of mass destruction.

Bulganin pointed out that recently, some people in the disarmament talks have once again proposed resolving the German issue and other unresolved international issues as preconditions for reaching a disarmament agreement. He said that this is actually equivalent to refusing to reach a disarmament agreement and creating new difficulties for reaching a disarmament agreement.

Referring to the issue of German reunification, Bulganin pointed out that the Soviet government has always advocated restoring German reunification in accordance with the national interests of the German people and the interests of European security. At the same time, the Soviet government has urged the U.S. government and the governments of other countries to pay attention to the fact that militarist forces are now being restored in West Germany. Obviously, this would make it impossible to establish a unified Germany that is peace-loving and democratic. Therefore, after soberly assessing the situation that has already formed in East and West Germany, one cannot but draw the conclusion that the issue of German reunification today should primarily be the issue of changing the foreign policy direction currently pursued by the government of the Federal Republic of Germany, which is making West Germany a dangerous hotbed of war in Europe.

Bulganin finally addressed the issue mentioned in Eisenhower's letter regarding the development of contacts and friendship between the people of the Soviet Union and the United States. He refuted Eisenhower's claim that the reason for the unsuccessful resolution of this issue and other international issues seemed to stem from the "harm" from the Soviet Union. He said that the Soviet Union is definitely not the one creating obstacles in this issue. For example, the Soviet government once proposed to the U.S. government to conclude a treaty of friendship and cooperation, but this proposal did not receive the support of the U.S. government. In addition, the Soviet government has provided the necessary conditions for American citizens to visit the Soviet Union, based on the corresponding agreements reached in Geneva. However, the U.S. government has not yet created such conditions for Soviet citizens to visit the United States to this day. Regarding Eisenhower's claim of "harm from the Soviet side," Bulganin said that the facts prove that the real and serious harm comes from the policies pursued by those who attempt to restore the "Cold War" and use the policy of strength as the basis for dealing with other countries.

Bulganin finally expressed his hope that the exchange of views between them would help in seeking correct ways to resolve outstanding international issues.

### 布尔加宁在给艾森豪威尔的复信中  再次建议协商解决裁军等问题

    布尔加宁在给艾森豪威尔的复信中
    再次建议协商解决裁军等问题
    新华社15日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科14日讯：苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁11日就裁减军备、禁止使用和试验原子武器和热核子武器、德国统一等问题再次给美国总统艾森豪威尔一封信。这封信已经由苏联驻美国大使查鲁宾在13日交给美国国务卿杜勒斯，请他转交给美国总统。
    布尔加宁的这封信是对艾森豪威尔8月4日写给他的一封信的答复。在这封信中，艾森豪威尔拒绝了布尔加宁在6月6日写给他的信中提出的建议。即希望美国政府也能像苏联一样在裁减军备方面作出贡献，而不必等待签订国际裁军协定。他怀疑这种措施“会有成效地消除恐惧和由于维持国家武装部队所引起的巨额开支”。他仍然认为，只有实行美国所提出的“空中视察”和“交换军事情报”等监督计划，才能促使大规模裁减军备。
    在谈到布尔加宁提出的裁减双方在德国的驻军的问题的时候，艾森豪威尔说，这个问题不能看作一个孤立的问题。在这方面，他认为，在日内瓦会议上为与会的四国政府同意的通过“自由选举”恢复德国统一的问题并没有解决。而且他还听说，苏联方面发表了一些“打算无限期地保持德国的分裂局面”的声明。此外，他还再次请求布尔加宁考虑他在今年3月1日的信中提出的另一项建议，即，确定出双方同意的日期，在这以后世界各地都不应当把分裂物质用来制造核子武器。
    关于这些问题，布尔加宁在他给艾森豪威尔的回信中说，苏联政府仍然认为，在目前的国际局势下，在各国就裁减军备和武装部队达成一致的协议之前，各国单独裁减自己的武装部队的措施会对加强国际信任有很大意义。其他国家如果采取类似步骤，也将会有助于各国建立友好关系，缓和各国人民至今仍然未能消释的疑虑和恐惧。
    在谈到美国提出的“空中视察计划”的时候，布尔加宁指出，空中视察和空中摄影问题同裁军是没有关系的。而且，如果把接受关于空中摄影的建议作为在裁军方面采取任何措施的条件，那末裁军问题的谈判就会陷于僵局。空中视察和空中摄影意味着，有关国家领土的材料以及它们的工业和其他资源的材料落到其他国家的手里。在目前的国际局势下，这只会增加彼此对突然袭击危险的恐惧，并且会引起战争歇斯底里亚。
    布尔加宁接着谈到裁军问题。他说，我不能不指出，苏联在谈判过程中，不止一次地采取努力，希望同西方国家达成协议。但是，在联合国机构中和在其他国际会议上的关于裁军谈判的情况说明，每当苏联为了就裁军问题达成协议而迁就其他谈判参加国和接受它们的建议的时候，这些国家就一定会放弃它们原来的建议，从而使裁军问题不能达成协议。在禁止原子武器和氢武器的问题上，也有同样的情况。
    关于禁止制造核子武器问题，布尔加宁说，苏联已经指出，禁止制造原子武器而不禁止使用这种武器，也不把这种武器从国家军备中清除出去，是决不能解决关于消除原子战争的危险的问题的。不但如此，这种办法实际上将意味着使亿万人民日益坚决地要求无条件禁止的这种大规模毁灭性武器合法化。
    布尔加宁希望艾森豪威尔注意关于停止试验原子武器和氢武器的问题。他说，目前的科学和技术条件已经有可能测知原子弹或者氢弹的任何一次爆炸，因此，停止试验原子武器和氢武器，这是不需要任何关于监督的国际协议的。由于这种情况，目前就有可能把这个问题同总的裁军问题分开来，单独地加以解决。各国就这个问题达成协议，将会成为走向无条件禁止这种型式的大规模毁灭性武器的第一个重要步骤。
    布尔加宁指出，最近在裁军会谈中又有人提出把解决德国问题和其他未决的国际问题作为就裁军问题达成协议的先决条件。他说这实际上就等于是拒绝达成裁军协议，并且给达成裁军协议造成新的困难。
    在谈到德国统一问题的时候，布尔加宁指出，苏联政府一直主张根据德国人民的民族利益和欧洲安全的利益恢复德国的统一。同时，苏联政府已经促请美国政府和其他国家的政府注意军国主义势力现在正在西德恢复起来的事实。很显然，这会使建立一个作为爱好和平和民主的、统一的德国成为不可能。因此，在清醒地估计东德和西德境内已经形成的局势之后，人们就不能不得出这样的结论：德国统一的问题今天首先应该是改变德意志联邦共和国政府现在所奉行的使西德成为欧洲危险的战争温床的外交政策方针的问题。
    布尔加宁最后谈到了艾森豪威尔来信中所提到的关于发展苏美两国人民之间的接触和友谊的问题。他反驳了艾森豪威尔把这个问题和其他国际问题的不能顺利解决的原因说成似乎是来自苏联的“祸害”的说法。他说，在这个问题上，制造障碍的绝不是苏联。例如，苏联政府曾经向美国政府建议缔结一项友好合作条约，可是，这项建议并没有得到美国政府的支持。此外，苏联政府根据在日内瓦达成的相应的协议，已为美国公民访问苏联提供了必要的条件。可是，美国政府一直到今天还没有给苏联公民访问美国创造这样的条件。关于艾森豪威尔的所谓“来自苏联方面的祸害”的说法，布尔加宁说，事实证明，真正的、严重的祸害是来自下列人士所奉行的政策，这些人企图恢复“冷战”和以实力地位政策作为他们与其他国家打交道的基础。
    布尔加宁最后表示希望，他们之间的意见交换会有助于寻求正确的途径来解决未决的国际问题。
