    Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, September 1st. The more than 50 million mu of major autumn crops in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are showing a scene of a bumper harvest. The sorghum grains are already full, the corn cobs have grown to a foot long, and the large-eared millet and other crops have begun to ripen and yellow. In just over twenty days, they can be universally harvested.

    According to the Autonomous Region's Department of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry's estimation based on the current growth of crops throughout the region, a bumper harvest this year is already a certainty. Barring unforeseen major disasters, the region's grain output can reach and exceed the original production plan.

    Currently, farmers are carrying out late-stage field management work such as weeding and tending the crops. Preparations for the autumn harvest are also being intensified. To prevent accidental disasters, especially frost and wind disasters, the weather forecasting work has been strengthened. Many banners and counties' villages have established specialized autumn protection committees, and agricultural production cooperatives have established autumn protection groups. Large quantities of autumn harvesting tools, such as sickles, wooden shovels, winnowing baskets, and winnowing machines, supplied to rural areas by supply and marketing cooperatives, have been delivered to the farmers.

    内蒙古迎接丰收
    大批收秋农具已送到农村
    新华社呼和浩特1日电　内蒙古自治区五千多万亩大秋作物呈现出一片丰收景象。高粱颗粒已饱满，玉米棒子已长到尺把长，穗大的谷子和其他作物已开始黄熟，再过二十多天就可以普遍收割。
    自治区农牧厅根据全区目前庄稼生长情况估计，今年丰收已成定局，如无意外特大灾害，全区粮食产量可以达到并超过原订生产计划。
    现在，农民们正进行放秋拢和拔草等后期田间管理工作。秋收的准备工作也正在加紧进行。为了防止意外灾害，特别是凌灾和风灾，天气预报的工作已经加强。很多旗、县的乡村里成立了专门的护秋委员会，农业生产合作社里建立了护秋小组。供销合作社供应农村的大批镰刀、木锨、簸箕、扇车等秋收农具，已送到农民手中。
