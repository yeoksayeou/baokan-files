Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 3rd. The Hong Kong British authorities have restored the "balanced" entry-exit measures, turning the short Shenzhen bridge into a bridge that separates hundreds of families from reuniting between Hong Kong and the mainland in just one morning. Today, the number of people, both adults and children, allowed to enter Hong Kong was only about one hundred. More than two hundred people, supporting the old and carrying the young, were forced to stay in Shenzhen. On the other side of the Shenzhen bridge, an equal number of people were anxiously sighing, unable to meet the relatives they had specifically come to welcome.

Today, among those stranded in Shenzhen and unable to enter Hong Kong, women and children accounted for the vast majority. Apart from a small number of people who were going abroad via Hong Kong, most were going to Hong Kong due to urgent family matters. A young woman, Ye Meilan, was rushing to Hong Kong because she received news that her husband, who works in Hong Kong, had appendicitis. An old lady, Yao Wanjun, who is sixty-six years old, was going to Hong Kong to host the wedding for her son, who teaches at Pui To Middle School in Hong Kong. Among those stranded and unable to enter Hong Kong was also an eighty-eight-year-old Wu old lady, whose children all live in Hong Kong. Recently, because one of her sons, who lives far away in the Americas, came to Hong Kong, she wanted to go to Hong Kong to seek a family reunion, regardless of the arduous journey. However, when she hobbled to the Shenzhen bridge, she was turned back by the police of the Hong Kong British authorities. All the others were also going to Hong Kong for similar reasons. However, their desire for this "thousand-mile human sentiment" was blocked by the Hong Kong British authorities' sudden restoration of the so-called "balanced entry-exit measures."

All the compatriots who were forced to stay in Shenzhen were sent to the Overseas Chinese Building tonight for accommodation. Some people who did not have enough money with them also received care. Shenzhen relevant authorities have established a special organization to settle and entertain people who may continue to be stranded due to difficulties in crossing the border, and have already started working.

All the compatriots who were forced to stay in Shenzhen expressed satisfaction with the government's proper arrangements and expressed deep indignation at the Hong Kong British authorities' unreasonable restrictions on the exchanges between Hong Kong and mainland compatriots.

    香港英国当局恢复平衡出入境办法第一个早上
    阻隔了香港和内地几百家亲人团聚
    新华社广州3日电　香港英国当局重新恢复平衡出入境办法，使几丈长的深圳桥在一个早上变成隔断了香港和内地几百家亲人团聚的天桥。今天，被允许进入香港的连大带小为数只有一百人左右。有二百多人扶老携幼地被迫滞留在深圳。在深圳桥的彼岸则有同样多的人在焦灼慨叹，会不到他们特地来迎候的亲人。
    今天在被滞留深圳进入香港的人当中，妇女和小孩占绝大多数，除少数是要经由香港出国的人之外，大都是因为有紧要的家事去香港的。青年妇女叶美兰是因为接到在香港做工的丈夫患了盲肠炎的消息而要赶去香港的。六十六岁的老太婆姚婉君，要到香港去替在香港培道中学教书的儿子主持婚礼。在被滞留不能进港的人当中还有一个八十八岁的吴老太太，她的儿女全都住在香港。最近因为她的一个远居美洲的儿子因事到了香港，她为了求得一次全家团聚，而不辞跋涉要到香港去。但是，当她一步一拐地跑到深圳桥边时却被香港英国当局的警察挡回了头。其他所有的人也因为类似的原因要去香港。但是，他们这种“千里人情”的愿望，却被香港英国当局突然恢复所谓“平衡出入境的办法”所阻挡住了。
    所有被迫滞留深圳的同胞今天晚上被送到华侨大厦里住宿，一些身边带钱不够的人也得到了照顾，深圳有关机关为了安顿和招待可能继续因过境困难而滞留的人已经成立了专门机构，并且已开始工作。
    所有被迫滞留深圳的同胞，对于得到政府的适当安顿，都表示满意，而对于香港英国当局的无理限制香港和内地同胞的往来都深表愤慨。
