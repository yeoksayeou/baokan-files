    At Daye Iron Mine
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter Feng Jian, Yao Changgan
    A Rich Iron Storehouse
    Some say, "Daye Iron Mine is a rich iron storehouse." You can hardly understand the true meaning of this sentence until you visit the iron mine.
    Walking into the Daye Iron Mine area, whether on the wide gravel roads or the winding paths, you can always see small pieces of ore mixed among the various colored pebbles. The clear streams are also dyed the color of iron sand. In the villages at the foot of Jianshan and Shizishan (Lion Mountain), farmers use stones to build courtyard walls and house foundations, and there are also large pieces of ore inside. When we visited the iron mine, we stayed in a small building at the foot of Luxiang Mountain. The owner told us that although this place is not designated as a mining area, there is also iron ore near the foot of the mountain, containing about 40% iron.
    Standing in the distance and looking out, the peaks of the iron mine are staggered. From Jianshan in the east, extending to Jianlin Mountain and Longdong in the west, the distance is only a few kilometers. It is said that such a concentration of ore bodies is rare. Jianshan and Shizishan, where mining stripping projects are underway, will become open-pit mines once the grass on the mountains is removed and millions of cubic meters of rock are uncovered. Next to an old mine pit at the foot of Shizishan, we saw that the steep and high cliffs were the exposed ore bodies.
    To truly know the richness of the iron mine, you must also look back at its history.
    Friends from the iron mine enthusiastically provided us with two volumes of information.
    The information recorded: According to legend, since the 3rd century – 227 AD – our ancestors began mining here, casting knives, guns and weapons to resist invaders. In 1890, China's first modern iron and steel joint enterprise – Hanyeping Coal and Iron Company – borrowed money from Germany, installed machines, and built mining area railways. The following year, it began to use mechanical open-pit mining in the mining area. Over the course of forty years, Hanyeping Company mined a total of more than 12 million tons of ore here, which was sent to the ironmaking blast furnaces of Hanyang Iron and Steel Plant and Daye Steel Plant. The ore here is of excellent quality and can be used for ironmaking without ore dressing.
    Imperialist countries also coveted this rich iron mine. For nearly a hundred years, American, Japanese, British, German, and French imperialists have spared no effort in sending geologists and "missionaries" to investigate the iron mine. After the establishment of Hanyeping Company, Japanese imperialism used the means of "advance payment" to sign a contract with Hanyeping Company, stipulating that it would steal 15 million tons of first-class ore and 5 million tons of pig iron from here within forty years,妄想 to cut off the throat of China's then-young iron and steel industry. Later, the traitor Yuan Shikai handed over the entire mining of the iron mine to Japan as a so-called "Sino-Japanese cooperative undertaking." During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the iron mine fell, and Japanese bandits carried out even more frantic looting here. According to existing records, from 1939 to 1945, the bandits stole a total of more than 4.84 million tons of ore from the iron mine.
    Seventeen hundred years have passed. After generations of mining and the frantic looting by Japanese bandits, today, the iron mine is still one of the richest iron storehouses in the motherland. Three years ago, geological exploration teams found new ore bodies here that had never been discovered by predecessors, proving that the reserves are far beyond past estimates. According to friends from the iron mine, the iron mine is enough for us to mine for decades, and in the future, our maximum annual mining volume will be several times higher than the highest annual mining volume in history.
    In the mining area, we heard a folk song praising the iron mine: "The iron mine is full of treasures, even gods cannot pull them away, nor can they be moved." For many years, people have been eager to use the rich resources of the iron mine to benefit the people of the motherland. Today, the iron mine opens its arms and welcomes mine builders from all over the country. They are using their hardworking and intelligent hands to begin to realize people's long-standing ideals.
        Today's Jianshan
    A steep mountain road, like a cloud ladder, hangs down from the top of Jianshan. Workers call it "Hero Slope." People have to bend their backs to climb up the "Hero Slope" to the top of Jianshan, more than 200 meters above sea level.
    Few people climb this "Hero Slope" now. This spring, the mine successively built two mountain roads, like belts circling around the waist of Jianshan and Shizishan, directly to the top. Since then, heavy electric shovels weighing one hundred and several tens of tons, dump trucks with carrying capacities of seven and a half tons, ten tons, and twenty-five tons, as well as huge drilling machines and air compressors, have all gone up to the top of the mountain, one after another. Workers are also picked up and dropped off by car.
    Simple offices have been built on the top of the mountain with reed mats and straw. Most of the iron mine staff work on the mountain. There is also a mechanical repair shop on the mountain.
    Li Guochi, a staff member of the iron mine, led us to visit the exciting mechanized construction scene on the top of Jianshan.
    No. 1 electric shovel is busy. It was the first electric shovel to climb Jianshan. At that time, the withered grass on the mountain had just sprouted, and spring had just arrived at the top. There was no road on the mountain, and Ai Yuanwei, an excellent young driver, drove this rock-digging giant, shoveling one bucket and filling one bucket, opening the road while advancing, and finally reached the highest peak of Jianshan. Listen! Now the electric shovel is roaring, emitting a loud noise as the machine runs at high speed. It swings its huge bucket, and five sharp teeth gnaw at the blasted rocks, removing three cubic meters at a time, enough to fill an ordinary truck with room to spare.
    A giant dump truck with a carrying capacity of 25 tons is parked at the rear of the No. 1 electric shovel, waiting to transport the rocks that the electric shovel puts down.
    Near and far, from Jianshan to Shizishan, dozens of dump trucks are shuttling back and forth, and seven heavy electric shovels strip several thousand cubic meters of rock from the mountain every day. Drilling machines are breathing and digging rock holes, wind drills are bouncing and making dada dada sounds, and blasters are digging vertical shafts more than ten meters deep.... People send packages of explosives into rock holes and vertical shafts. With the dull roar of a series of cannons, large swaths of mountain rock crack and fall.
    Li Guochi said: "Now you can't see the grass on top of the mountain. Over the past year, we have shoveled off three peaks of Jianshan, leveling the top of the mountain by more than 20 meters. You see, this used to be a majestic and steep peak, but now it has become an open working face. Over there, we have also cut away a large piece of the peak of Shizishan." Six months ago, people who had just arrived at the iron mine always liked to climb to the top of Jianshan, breathe the cool morning breeze, and enjoy the wonders of dawn and sunrise on the mountain through the blue mist. Now, Jianshan has dropped by more than 20 meters, and it is no longer possible to see the sunrise first on the top of the mountain.
    The nights at the iron mine are charming. Whenever night falls, the town at the foot of the mountain is already sound asleep, but the top of the mountain is like a sleepless city. Various mechanical noises form a symphony, shaking the quiet valley, faintly audible several miles away. The brilliant lights on the mountain and the stars in the night sky reflect each other. Mine builders are working day and night in order to build the mine as soon as possible and provide high-quality ore for the blast furnaces of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Joint Enterprise.
        Electrified Railway
    I heard that the electrification railway project in the mining area is as difficult as the Baoji-Chengdu Railway. With great interest, we entered the office of Deputy Mine Director Liu of the iron mine.
    Deputy Mine Director Liu spread out a blueprint of the project and asked us with a smile:
     "Do you want me to compare it with the Baoji-Chengdu Railway? The terrain in the area where the road is being built is indeed very rugged and complex.
     "You see," Deputy Mine Director Liu pointed to a mountain on the map with dense lines, "This is the most difficult section of the road construction project. Thirteen layers of railway lines will be built on this steep slope in the future. It is not easy. These thirteen lines are stacked one on top of the other. If there is a slight negligence during road construction, if one line slides, it can affect the other twelve lines. You see, aren't these lines all curved in "zigzags"? In the future, electric locomotives will climb to the top of the mountain along these "zigzag" lines. The difference in height between the lowest and highest points of the line here is 120 meters. Steam locomotives cannot climb such a slope."
    He picked up a red pencil and calculated on the paper, then said:
     "The first phase of the electrified railway, which goes to Shizishan, is now under construction. It is estimated that the electric locomotive will be able to go up the mountain in the spring of next year, or a little later. The second phase of the project is to Jianshan; the third phase is to the granodiorite stockpile and the ore stockpile. These three phases of the project have a total railway length of 58 kilometers, of which 10 kilometers will move with the working face on the mountain in the future. Let's calculate based on 48 kilometers. A total of more than 5 million cubic meters of stone must be excavated. On average, for every kilometer advanced, 100,000 cubic meters of rock must be dug. In addition, the filling project is not small. In the deepest places, stones must be filled as high as four or five stories."
    From Deputy Mine Director Liu, we once again saw the perseverance and firm self-confidence of the mine builders in overcoming difficulties. In the future, electric locomotives will run up and down the mountain, transporting the rocks stripped from the mountain. On average, a train loaded with ore will leave for the ironmaking area of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Joint Enterprise every few minutes. At that time, people will gratefully remember the hard work of today's builders.
    Leaving the office, we walked towards the road construction area. The white marble blasted by the builders from the mountainside shone crystal clear in the sun. Looking out from here, a large number of migrant workers are shouting and building another roadbed in the distance, which is the Wuhan-Daye Railway under construction. The electrified railway in the mining area will be connected to the Wuhan-Daye Railway in the future, connecting the mining area with Wuhan and Huangshi City.
      New Town at the Foot of the Mountain
    The car we were riding in stopped at the newly opened People's Square at the foot of the iron mine. It was 1:45 pm. The scorching sun made people's lips dry. Getting out of the car, we immediately heard the loud shouts of "Popsicle! Popsicle!" The mining area is less than 30 kilometers away from Huangshi City, and there are six buses going back and forth every day. Small vendors bring popsicles from Huangshi City to the mountain.
    We walked into the state-owned commercial joint store with a wide variety of commodities, drank two bottles of soda, and hurried out to tour the city appearance of this emerging town of the iron mine.
    The brand-new Iron Mine Cinema is located opposite the joint store. The cinema does not seem to be much smaller than the Zhongyuan Cinema in Wuhan City, but there are no balconies. Out-of-town Peking Opera troupes are performing for the workers here, and the film has been moved to a temporary outdoor screening venue.
    Five main traffic roads have been newly built here. A row of shops has been newly built next to the widest Iron Mine Avenue. Shoemakers, tinsmiths, and letter carvers are lined up one after another. Sewing machines are humming and sewing floral cloth dresses. The cabinets of the joint state-private restaurant are filled with various dishes for drinking and eating. The female clerk enthusiastically entertains customers. A small shop selling bread, cigarettes, alcohol, and groceries is said to be able to sell 200 to 300 yuan a day.
    Walking along the mine road, we came to the workers' residential area. The mine builders only moved into the new houses with an area of 10,000 square meters that were completed at the end of last year a few months ago. Here, a large area of buildings is rising from the ground again. Scaffolding is dense, about a dozen buildings. Turning back from the mine road, we came to the iron mine's kindergarten. Children were playing on the newly painted slides, and sunshades were built above the slides. The Iron Mine People's Hospital has also been completed on the hillside in front of the nursery....
    In the past year, the population here has increased from more than 9,000 to more than 18,000. Last year, the People's Government invested more than 200,000 yuan to build this mining town, and this year, it invested nearly 300,000 yuan. The Workers' Cultural Palace, the Iron Mine Middle School buildings, and the grain depot have all started construction, and the dairy farm will soon be open for business. In the near future, state-owned canteens, vegetable markets, and bathhouses will also be built for the workers....
    We thought that we would come to the iron mine again after some time and spend a weekend here no matter what. At that time, we can not only dance and watch movies with the builders, and cheer for their games, but perhaps the Workers' Cultural Palace under Luxiang Mountain has also been completed, and the beautiful recreation rooms, social rooms, and reading rooms will all open their doors to welcome us.

    在大冶铁山
    新华社记者　冯健　姚昌淦
    富饶的铁库
    有人说：“大冶铁山是个富饶的铁库。”不到铁山，你就难以理解这句话的真正含义。
    走进铁山矿区，无论在宽阔的碎石马路上，或是曲折的羊肠小道上，你随时都能看到有小块矿石，间杂在各色石子中间；清澈的溪流，也染上了铁砂的颜色；尖山和狮子山脚下的村庄里，农民用石头砌成院墙、屋基，里边也有大块的矿石。我们在铁山访问的时候，住在鹿樟山下一栋小楼里。主人告诉我们：这里没有划入采矿区，但是在近处山下，也有铁矿石，其中还含有40％左右的铁呢。
    站在远处眺望，铁山群峰交错。从东部的尖山，连绵到西部的尖林山、龙洞，相去不过几公里路。据说，矿体这样集中，是不多见的。正在进行采矿剥离工程的尖山和狮子山，只等铲去山上的青草，再揭开几百万方岩石，就成了一个开阔的露天采矿场。我们在狮子山下一个旧矿坑旁边看到，那又陡又高的悬崖峭壁，就是袒露出来的矿体。
    要想真正知道铁山的富饶，还必须翻一翻铁山的历史。
    铁矿的朋友们，热情地给我们拿出了两本资料。
    资料里记载：相传从第三世纪——公元227年起，我们的祖先就开始在这里采矿，铸成刀枪武器，抵御侵略者。1890年，我国第一个现代化钢铁联合企业——汉冶萍煤铁有限公司，向德国贷款，装置机器，修筑矿区铁路，第二年开始在矿区使用机械露天采矿。汉冶萍公司先后四十年，在这里一共开采了一千二百多万吨矿石，送进汉阳钢铁厂和大冶钢厂的炼铁高炉。这里的矿石品质优良，不经过选矿，就能炼铁。
    帝国主义国家，也曾经十分垂涎这个富饶的铁山。近百年来，美、日、英、德、法帝国主义者都曾费尽心机，派地质学家、“传教士”来铁山调查。在汉冶萍公司成立以后，日本帝国主义曾用“预付价款”的手段和汉冶萍公司签定合同，规定在四十年内从这里窃取一千五百万吨头等矿石和五百万吨生铁，妄想借此掐断当时我国幼小的钢铁工业的喉咙。后来，窃国大盗袁世凯又把整个铁山的开采，作为所谓“中日合作事业”送给了日本。抗日战争期间，铁山沦陷，日本强盗在这里乱开乱采，进行更加疯狂的掠夺。据现有资料记载，从1939年到1945年，强盗们一共从铁山抢走了四百八十四万多吨矿石。
    一千七百多年过去了。经过了历代开采，遭受过日本强盗的疯狂抢劫，但是今天，铁山仍然是祖国富饶的铁库之一。三年前，地质勘探队伍在这里找到了前人从未发现过的新矿体，证明蕴藏量的丰富，远远超过了过去的估量。据铁矿的朋友们谈，铁山够我们开采几十年，而且将来我们每年最高采矿量，比历史上最高一年的采矿量多好几倍。
    在矿区，我们听到一首赞美铁山的歌谣：“铁山遍地宝，不出神仙拉不动，搬不倒。”多少年来，人们一直渴望用铁山富饶的资源为祖国人民造福。今天，铁山敞开了她的胸怀，接待着来自全国各地的矿山建设者。他们，正用自己勤劳、智慧的双手，开始实现人们多年的理想。
        今日尖山
    一条陡山道，像云梯一样，从尖山顶悬垂下来。工人们管他叫“好汉坡”。人们要躬起脊背，才能沿着这条“好汉坡”，爬上拔海二百多公尺高的尖山山顶。
    这条“好汉坡”，现在已经很少再有人爬上爬下了。今年春天，矿上先后修筑了两条登山公路，像带子一样在尖山、狮子山山腰里环绕盘旋，直上顶峰。从此，一百几十吨重的重型电铲，载重七吨半、十吨、二十五吨的自卸卡车，以及巨大的穿孔机、空气压缩机等，一台一台都上了山顶。工人们上下山也都有汽车接送了。
    山顶上，用芦席、稻草搭盖了简易的办公室，铁矿的大部分工作人员都到山上办公。山上还有机械修理场。
    铁矿一位工作人员黎国墀同志，引我们参观了尖山顶上令人兴奋的机械化施工场景。
    一号电铲正忙着。它是最先登上尖山的电铲。那时候，满山上的枯草刚刚抽出嫩芽，春天才飞临山顶。山上没有路，优秀的青年司机艾元维，驾驶着这台掘石巨人，铲一斗，填一斗，一边开路，一边前进，终于登上了尖山的最高峰。听！现在电铲怒吼着，发出机器快速运转时的巨响。它挥动巨大的铲斗，五颗尖利的牙齿啃啮着爆破下来的岩石，一次就铲去了三立方，足足够装满一辆普通载重汽车还有余。
    一辆载重二十五吨的巨型自卸卡车，停在一号电铲的尾部，等着把电铲铲斗里放下来的岩石运走。
    近处，远处，从尖山到狮子山，几十辆自卸汽车往返奔驰着，七部重型电铲每天要从山上剥下来好几千方岩石。穿孔机喘着气开凿岩洞，风钻暴跳着，达达达地叫着，爆破手们凿开了一个个十多公尺深的竖井……。人们把成包的炸药送进岩洞、竖井，随着连珠炮般沉闷的轰响，大片大片的山岩崩裂下来了。
    黎国墀说：“现在你们看不见盖在山顶上的青草了。一年来，我们铲掉了尖山的三个山顶，把山头铲平了二十多公尺。你看，原来这里是雄峙尖峭的山峰，现在变成开阔的掌子面了。那边，狮子山的山峰，我们也已经削去了它一大片。”半年以前，刚到铁山的人，总爱爬到尖山顶上，呼吸着清凉的晨风，透过青色的薄雾，欣赏山上的黎明和日出的奇景。现在，尖山下降了二十多公尺，在山顶上已经不能最先看见日出了。
    铁山的夜晚是迷人的。每当夜幕低垂，山脚下的市镇已经酣睡，山顶上还像一座不眠之市，各种机械声响组成交响乐曲，震荡着静静的山谷，几里以外隐约可闻；山上灿烂的电灯和夜空的繁星交相辉映。矿山建设者们夜以继日地劳动着，是为了早日把矿山建成，及时给武汉钢铁联合企业的高炉生产优良的矿石。
        电气化铁路
    听说矿区的电气化铁路工程像宝成铁路一样艰巨。我们怀着极大的兴趣，走进铁矿刘副矿长的办公室。
    刘副矿长摊开一张晒制好的工程示意蓝图，笑着问我们：
     “你们要我和宝成路比一比吗？这里筑路地区的地形，的确是十分崎岖复杂的。
     “你们来看，”刘副矿长指着图上一个线路密集的山地说，“这里就是筑路工程中最艰难的一段，在这个陡峭的山坡上，将来要层层叠叠修筑十三层铁路线。可不容易呵，这十三条线路，一条压着一条，筑路时稍有疏忽，若是一条滑了坡，就能牵动其他十二条。你们看这些线路不都是曲里拐弯儿的“之”字形吗，将来的电气机车，就要沿着这“之”字的线路爬上山顶。这里的线路，从低处到高处，相差一百二十公尺高哩。这样的坡度，蒸汽机车是爬不上来的。”
    他拿起红铅笔在纸上计算了一下，接着说：
     “现在开工的是电气化铁路的第一期工程，通上狮子山的。估计到明年春暖花开的时候，或者稍迟一点，电气机车就能上山了。第二期工程是通上尖山的；第三期是通到闪长岩堆置场和矿石堆置场的。这三期工程，铁路总长五十八公里，其中有十公里是随着将来矿山上的工作面移动的。就按四十八公里算吧，一共要开凿五百多万方石头。平均每前进一公里，就得挖上十万方的岩石。还有，填方工程也不小，最深的地方，要用石头填筑四、五层楼那样高。”
    从刘副矿长那里，我们再一次看到矿山建设者们克服困难的毅力和坚定的自信心。将来，电气机车在矿山上下奔驰，运送山上剥下来的岩石；平均几分钟就有一列满载矿石的列车，开往武汉钢铁联合企业的炼铁区。那时候，人们就会感激地怀念起今天建设者们辛勤的劳动。
    出了办公室，我们走向筑路区。建设者们从山腰里爆破下来的洁白的大理岩，在太阳下晶莹闪光。从这里居高远眺，远处有大批民工，正吆喝着修筑另外一条路基，那是建设中的武（昌）大（冶）铁路。矿区这条电气化铁路，将来就和武冶铁路接轨，把矿区和武昌、黄石市连接起来。
      山脚下的新镇
    我们坐的汽车在铁山山脚下新辟的人民广场停下来。那是下午一点三刻。骄阳晒得人唇焦舌干。走下车，我们迎面就听到响亮的“冰棒！冰棒！”的叫卖声。矿区离黄石市不足三十公里，一天有六趟汽车往返，小商贩们把冰棒从黄石市运到山里来了。
    我们走进商品琳琅满目的国营商业联合门市部，喝了两瓶汽水，就急忙忙走出来，巡礼铁山这个新兴市镇的市容。
    崭新的铁山电影院就座落在联合门市部的对面，电影院看来不比武汉市的中原电影院小多少，只是没有楼座。外地来的京剧团，正在这里为工人演出，电影移到一个临时的露天放映场去了。
    这里已经新修了五条交通干道。在最宽的铁山大道一旁，新盖了一排店铺。做皮鞋的，打白铁的，刻字的，一家连着一家。缝纫机达达响着，正在缝花布连衣裙哩。公私合营餐馆橱柜里，摆着各种下酒咽饭的菜肴，女营业员热情地应酬顾客。一家卖面包、烟酒、杂货的小铺子，听说一天能卖上二、三百元钱。
    顺着矿山路往前走，是工人住宅区。矿山建设者们，几个月前才搬进了去年年底落成的一万平方公尺的新住宅；这里，一大片楼房住宅又从平地上升起来了。脚手架密密麻麻的，约模有十好几栋。从矿山路折回来，是铁矿的幼儿园，孩子们正在新油漆好的滑梯上嬉戏着，滑梯上面搭着遮阳凉棚。托儿所前边山坡上，铁山人民医院也已落成……。
    过去一年，这里的人口从九千来人增加到了一万八千多。去年，人民政府投资了二十来万元，建设这个矿区市镇，今年投资近三十万元。工人文化宫、铁山中学校舍、粮食仓库，都动工了，奶牛场也快营业了。不久的将来，还要为工人们建设国营食堂、菜场、浴池……。
    我们想，过一些时候再来铁山，无论如何要在这里度过一个周末。那时候，我们不仅可以和建设者们在一起跳舞，看电影，为他们的球赛助威，也许鹿樟山下的工人文化宫也已落成，漂亮的游艺室、交谊室、阅览室都会敞开大门欢迎我们了。
