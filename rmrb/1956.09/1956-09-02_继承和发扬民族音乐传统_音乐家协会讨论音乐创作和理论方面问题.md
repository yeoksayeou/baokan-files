Xinhua News Agency, September 1st: The Second Enlarged Council Meeting of the Chinese Musicians Association, held immediately after the First National Music Week, concluded on the 31st after three days.

    In accordance with the spirit of "Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom," the meeting discussed some of the main issues in music creation and theory, in connection with the various programs performed during Music Week.

    The meeting focused on the issue of further inheriting and developing national musical traditions.

    Since liberation, the music community has done a great deal of work in collecting and arranging national musical heritage. However, the tendency to belittle national heritage still exists seriously. Some people inappropriately emphasize that national music is "backward" and "unscientific," and adopt a uncritical and dogmatic attitude towards learning foreign music. In the work of collecting and sorting out national music, some people also take a rude attitude, forcibly transplanting foreign things into national art, rather than making organic combinations, thereby destroying the original style and characteristics.

    The meeting pointed out that our national musical heritage is infinitely rich, its forms are extremely beautiful, and it has always been loved and heard by the broad masses of the people. Music workers should absorb and use advanced foreign musical theories, techniques, and methods on the basis of inheriting national traditions to create works with national characteristics.

    The meeting gave due evaluation to the contributions of outstanding musicians Huang Zi, Xiao Youmei, Liu Tianhua, Li Jinhui, and the deceased revolutionary musicians Zhang Shu and Ren Guang, among others besides Nie Er and Xian Xinghai, since the May Fourth Movement. It was particularly pointed out that their works are a new musical tradition that is inseparable from our classical and folk music traditions and should be well inherited.

    The meeting studied the issues of promoting musical creation and cultivating a new generation of musical talent.

    The meeting called on all music workers to continue to study various issues in music theory, carry out academic free debate, and promote the healthier development of music work.

    Zhou Yang, Deputy Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, also attended the meeting and spoke. He hoped that the music community would strengthen unity, attach greater importance to, study and develop national traditions, while absorbing all valuable achievements in world musical culture, especially studying the special laws of national musical art, developing its characteristics, and creating new music with distinct national characteristics, so that it shines in the field of world musical art.

    继承和发扬民族音乐传统
    音乐家协会讨论音乐创作和理论方面问题
    据新华社1日讯　紧接在第一届全国音乐周之后举行的中国音乐家协会第二次理事会扩大会议，历时三天，已经在31日结束。
    会议根据“百家争鸣”的精神，联系音乐周演出的各种节目，对音乐创作和音乐理论方面的一些主要问题进行了讨论。
    会议着重讨论了进一步继承和发扬民族音乐传统的问题。
    解放以来音乐界在搜集、整理民族音乐遗产方面作了许多工作。但是轻视民族遗产的倾向还是严重存在。有些人不适当地强调民族音乐“落后”、“不科学”，对学习外国音乐，采取无批判的教条主义态度。在搜集和整理民族音乐工作中也有些人采取粗暴态度，把外国东西硬搬到民族艺术里头，而不是作有机的结合，以致破坏了原有的风格和特色。
    会议指出，我们的民族音乐遗产是无限丰富的，其形式是极其优美的，一直被广大人民所喜见乐闻。音乐工作者应该在继承民族传统的基础之上，吸收和运用外国先进的音乐理论、技巧和方法，创造具有民族风格的作品。
    会议对“五四”以来，聂耳、冼星海之外的优秀音乐家黄自、萧友梅、刘天华、黎锦晖，以及已故革命音乐家张曙、任光等人的贡献，给予应有的评价。并且特别指出，他们的作品是和我国古典、民间音乐传统不可割裂的新音乐传统，应该很好地加以继承。
    会议对繁荣音乐创作和培养青年一代音乐人才的问题作了研究。
    会议要求全体音乐工作者对音乐理论方面的各项问题，继续进行研究，开展学术性的自由论争，促使音乐工作更加健康地向前发展。
    中共中央宣传部副部长周扬也到会讲话。他希望音乐界加强团结，更好地重视、研究和发扬民族传统，同时吸收世界音乐文化中一切有价值的成果，特别要研究民族音乐艺术的特殊规律，发扬其特点，创造具有鲜明民族风格的新音乐，使它在世界音乐艺术领域中放出异彩。
