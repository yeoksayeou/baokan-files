    Opinions on Scientific and Technological Exchange
    I am an engineering technician. I would like to talk about my opinions on scientific and technological exchange in our country.
    Our country's current level of science and technology is quite backward, and we must catch up. However, on the road to advancing towards science, I feel that there are man-made obstacles, namely, the principle-less maintenance of secrecy. State secrets, we must keep. But we often encounter some problems that have already been published publicly in magazines and are not secrets in other countries, but within our internal workings, we must maintain "secrecy" from each other. It is necessary to request information from each other through organizations and complete certain procedures. However, after organizational review, assistance should be given to solve the other party's problems as much as possible, and the other party should not be rejected on the pretext of "secrecy." I believe that relevant departments should properly grasp the principles of secrecy so that technical exchanges can proceed normally.
    In addition, I suggest establishing a national scientific and technological exchange center station to master domestic and foreign information. Scientific and technological workers should report their scientific research experiences and conclusions, as well as advanced technical experiences, to the exchange center station. In this way, if a unit has problems in its work, it can consult the exchange center station; if a unit finds that the work it is doing has already been concluded, then there is no need to waste time and manpower to do it again. With such an exchange center station, we can avoid the phenomenon of scientists and technicians shutting themselves at home and groping blindly, wasting manpower. I believe that this institution should be presided over by the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Although this institution will be relatively large, it is worthwhile for relevant departments to seriously consider it in order to save the national scientific and technological strength.

### 对科学技术交流的意见

    对科学技术交流的意见
    我是一个工程技术人员。我想谈一下我对我国科学技术交流的一点意见。
    我国现有的科学技术水平是相当落后的，我们必需迎头赶上。但是，在向科学进军的道路上，我感到有着人为的障碍，即无原则的保密。国家的机密，我们是必须保守的。但是常会遇到一些问题是杂志上早就公开发表过的，在别的国家并不是机密的东西，而在我们内部却要互相“保密”。互相索取资料，通过组织，办理一定的手续是必要的。但是经过组织审查以后，就应该给于协助，尽可能解决对方的问题，而不应该以“保密”为借口就把对方拒于千里之外。我认为有关部门应该好好地掌握保密的原则，使技术交流能够正常地进行。
    另外我建议建立一个全国性的科学技术交流中心站，掌握国内外的资料。科学技术工作者们都把自己的科学研究经验和结论，以及技术上的先进经验，向交流中心站汇报。这样，一个单位在工作中有问题，就可以向交流中心站查询；如果一个单位发现自己所进行的工作已经有了结论，那就不需要再浪费时间、人力去搞。有了这样的交流中心站，就可以避免科学技术者们闷在家里瞎摸、浪费人力的现象。我认为这个机构应当由中国科学院主持，虽然这个机构会比较庞大，但是对节省全国的科学技术力量来讲，却是值得有关部门认真考虑的。
