Comrade Tao Lujia, First Secretary of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, spoke:
    I fully agree with Comrade Liu Shaoqi's political report, Comrade Deng Xiaoping's report on revising the Party Constitution, and Comrade Zhou Enlai's report on the proposal for the Second Five-Year Plan. Now, based on the situation in Shanxi Province, I would like to share some opinions on the relationship between industry and agriculture.
    Shanxi has favorable conditions for developing industry. It has abundant underground resources. According to the data from the geological department, 54 kinds of mineral resources have been discovered, among which the coal reserve is about 400 billion tons. It already has a certain foundation of modern industry; its geographical location is between the Baotou iron and steel base and the Sanmenxia hydroelectric power station. This determines that Shanxi will inevitably develop into an industrial base mainly focusing on heavy industry, and all our work must revolve around the central link of industrial construction, especially heavy industry construction.
    To develop industry, agriculture must be developed accordingly. And Shanxi also has good conditions for developing agriculture. First of all, the socialist transformation of agriculture has been successfully completed. This eliminates the contradiction between socialist industrialization and the small-scale peasant economy from the perspective of production relations. Secondly, agricultural resources are also very rich. In addition to a variety of food crops, there are also a large number of cash crops such as cotton, hemp, flue-cured tobacco, and oil crops, as well as continuously growing fur, silk, dried fruits, fruits, medicinal materials, timber, and other mountain products. At the same time, after the realization of agricultural cooperativization, the socialist enthusiasm of farmers is unprecedentedly high. With unprecedented creative labor, they are carrying out production and construction undertakings such as soil and water conservation, afforestation, small-scale water conservancy construction, improvement of agricultural production technology, and the development of animal husbandry, and beginning to show the broad prospects of comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline occupations.
    However, looking ahead, due to the high-speed development of industry, the contradiction between the ever-increasing demand for commodity grain and industrial raw materials and the current low level of agricultural production will continue to exist in the next few years. Therefore, as Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in the article "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation," "We must never separate or isolate industry and agriculture, socialist industrialization and socialist agricultural transformation. We must never emphasize only one aspect and weaken the other."
    In order to meet the needs of agricultural technical reform, local industries should actively and gradually develop small and medium-sized machinery factories and fertilizer factories.
    Our agricultural transformation has two historical tasks: social reform and technical reform. To complete the latter task is more long-term and arduous than cooperativization. This is because heavy industry cannot supply agriculture with modern technical equipment in large quantities, not only at present but also in the next few years. So, how should we view the issue of agricultural technical reform in the coming period? Some comrades believe that under the current conditions, we can only wait for the arrival of a large number of tractors and do not need to propose a policy for agricultural technical reform. We believe that agricultural technical reform should include two aspects: the modernization of production tools and the adoption of scientific achievements in production methods (including the good and useful experiences left by our ancestors). Therefore, it cannot be simply regarded as a tractor problem. Under the current conditions, emphasizing agricultural mechanization is certainly not realistic. However, agricultural technical reform is by no means something that cannot be done at present, but there are many things that can be done. Taking a passive waiting attitude is wrong. We believe that agricultural technical reform should also adopt a method of gradual advancement from low to high, and there should be a sufficient preparatory step before large-scale technical reform arrives. The various agricultural technical measures pointed out in Comrade Shaoqi's report are important contents of our current agricultural technical reform. In fact, after cooperativization, farmers' past conservative habits in technology have changed greatly. They are increasingly actively demanding that industry provide technical assistance to agriculture, especially in terms of tool improvement, chemical fertilizers, and water conservancy construction. Now, what kind of technical assistance can our industry provide to agriculture? As far as Shanxi's local industry is concerned, not long ago, we made a preliminary plan for the next seven years. According to this plan, a system of factories for repairing and manufacturing new agricultural tools and small machinery for farmland water conservancy will be gradually established throughout the province; two small steel plants will be expanded and newly built using窩子 iron ore to supply the steel needed by local industries; utilizing the province's resources, 88 small and medium-sized phosphorus fertilizer, bone fertilizer, peat fertilizer, black alum, and calcium sulfate fertilizer factories will be built, with an annual fertilizer output of about 800,000 tons; the annual output of pesticide manufacturing can reach more than 30,000 tons; using local materials, two small and medium-sized cement plants will be established to meet the needs of agricultural water conservancy construction. Two small hydropower stations have already been built in rural areas, and they will gradually increase year by year in the future. All of these will undoubtedly promote the improvement of agricultural technology, the growth of new technical talents, and the rapid development of agricultural productive forces. These industrial enterprises are generally small in scale, quick to build, require less investment, and yield significant results. In the past three years, our local state-owned industries have invested only 2 percent of the total investment in this area. Obviously, this is a shortcoming. In the future, investment in this area should be appropriately and plannedly increased.
    The development of local industry and agriculture should be planned in combination in order to give play to the mutually promoting roles of light industry and agriculture.
    In order to promote the development of agriculture, and at the same time, to accumulate more funds for heavy industry construction, the role of light industry must also be sufficiently estimated. Our local industries have many favorable conditions in developing light industry. In the past, our understanding of the role of light industry was not clear enough, and the plans for industry and agriculture were separated from each other, and we did not pay enough attention to their mutual connection. In the first three years of the First Five-Year Plan, the investment of local state-owned industries in the development of light industry only accounted for 35 percent of the total investment, while the investment in the development of agricultural and sideline product processing industries only accounted for 0.6 percent. As a result, last year, a large number of fruits, mountain products, medicinal materials, etc., were not purchased due to the lack of processing industries, which made farmers very dissatisfied. Recently, after investigation and analysis, we learned that there are the following three different situations in the province's local industry and agricultural resources: the first is that raw materials are abundant, such as fruits and dried fruits, but there are few or no processing or manufacturing factories; the second is that the existing factories have large equipment capacity, such as flour mills, but there are insufficient raw materials; the third is that the existing raw materials are not many, but the quality is very good and has development prospects, such as the flax and sugar beets in Yanbei, and there are no corresponding factories now. Based on this, we have made appropriate arrangements for the development of light industry in the plan for developing local industry in the next seven years. It is estimated that the output value of light industry will increase threefold compared to 1955 in seven years. In this way, the development of the cotton textile industry will promote the rapid upsurge of agricultural production in the cotton-producing areas of southern and central Shanxi. At the same time, the development of light industries such as flax textile, silk reeling, wool textile, leather, paper making, fruit processing, starch, brewing, and oil extraction will also promote the ability of 70 percent of the mountainous areas in the province to expand the reproduction of the agricultural economy, thereby gradually changing the poor and backward situation in the mountainous areas. In particular, because industry and agriculture are planned in combination, the thinking of rural work cadres has jumped out of the narrow circle of only paying attention to agriculture and neglecting industrial development.
    In developing light industry, we must also pay attention to the relationship between coastal areas and inland areas. In order to reasonably solve this problem, we believe that with the development of production and the continuous improvement of people's purchasing power, the following three methods can be adopted: 1. The light industry in coastal cities focuses on producing products needed nationwide and relatively high-end daily consumer goods, while the light industry in inland areas focuses on using local materials and processing or manufacturing locally, focusing on producing products needed by the local working masses; 2. For similar light industrial products, when selling, implement high-quality high-price and low-quality low-price; 3. For certain products that are in oversupply, the state will conduct national balance and make necessary controls. Of course, when developing light industry in inland areas, attention should be paid to the needs of light industry in coastal cities in terms of raw materials; in terms of technology, learn from light industry in coastal cities to overcome the existing backward state.
    In order to regulate and promote the development of industry and agriculture, the business methods of commercial work should be changed. The shortcomings of industrial and agricultural production and certain contradictions between them often sensitively reflect in the commodity circulation process. Here, if the commercial work is done well, it can regulate and promote the development of industry and agriculture. If it is the opposite, it will fuel the development of contradictions between industry and agriculture. Therefore, commercial work must be strengthened to facilitate the economic consolidation of the worker-peasant alliance.
    In recent years, socialist commerce has played an important role in stabilizing prices, ensuring needs, and the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce. This should be affirmed. However, under the current situation where social reform has achieved a decisive victory, many of the methods used in the past to restrict capitalism are no longer applicable. Facts have proved that the commercial sector's excessive centralization of regulations, excessively strict market management, excessively detailed and rigid compartmentalization of responsibilities, excessively broad scope of contract purchase and sales, excessive regulations and restrictions, and blind distribution of goods from top to bottom have already produced many malpractices in commodity circulation, and the masses have many opinions on this. Now it is time to quickly change this.
    In the past four months, we have conducted a typical experiment on commercial system reform in Taigu County. We have learned that the most important thing at present is to make all commercial workers good at adapting to the new environment and earnestly learn how to do business; to organize necessary free markets under the unified leadership of state-owned commerce; to appropriately expand the autonomous rights of county and city-run commerce, and to implement a profit-sharing and excess reward system on the basis of economic accounting. Based on this, we established a new type of rural primary market in Taigu County, activating the trade in which farmers exchange what they have for what they need; allowed commercial personnel and small traders and vendors from public-private joint ventures in county towns to go to the countryside to engage in both purchasing and sales activities, breaking the situation in which supply and marketing cooperatives divided and monopolized the rural market; systematically implemented a purchasing and ordering system from bottom to top, and allowed goods to be purchased regardless of regional boundaries; allowed county-run, public-private joint venture industrial enterprises and handicraft production cooperatives to have the right to sell their own products, except for those purchased by the commercial sector; appropriately increased the purchase price of certain agricultural products without raising the selling price; adopted a method of grading and pricing according to quality, and appropriately lowered the price of certain products of poor quality; reasonably adjusted the regional price differences between mountainous areas and plains. The above measures have been warmly welcomed by urban and rural masses; the "official" style of state-owned and cooperative-run commerce, where there was only one store and no branch stores, and the subjective style of commercial personnel who only paid attention to completing the sales quota and purchase volume assigned by superiors without paying attention to investigating the market and people's needs, has been initially reversed. Since the implementation of this commercial system reform, the enthusiasm of commercial personnel for learning how to do business has increased; the county party committee's leadership over commercial work has also been greatly strengthened; the business volume of various commercial sectors in urban and rural areas has grown rapidly; the state's profits and taxes have also increased accordingly. The most important gain is that this not only meets the needs of the urban and rural masses, but also effectively promotes the development of county-run industry, handicrafts, and agricultural and sideline occupations.
    Emphasize investigation and research, strengthen planning work, and avoid both conservative and rash tendencies.
    In summary, in order to correctly handle the relationship between industry and agriculture to promote the common upsurge of industry and agriculture, the task of the local party committee is to strengthen the overall leadership of the planned economy under the unified leadership of the central government, and effectively organize and give play to the mutually promoting and mutually restraining roles of various economic sectors such as industry, agriculture, and commerce. To this end, it is necessary to maintain a correct proportion between the development of heavy industry and light industry, and between industry and agriculture. In the past, we understood this in principle, but in actual work, we lacked serious investigation and research, so we often had no idea in our minds. When the central government advocated frugality last year, we and some economic departments unilaterally emphasized the mutually restraining role between various economic sectors, which produced a right-leaning conservative tendency. Conversely, in the first half of this year, after the central government proposed opposing right-leaning conservative thinking, we unilaterally emphasized the mutually promoting role between various economic sectors, without paying attention to the development ratio between heavy industry, light industry, and agriculture, and without paying attention to the fact that this ratio contains a series of complex relationships such as local and overall, central and local, urban and rural, coastal and inland, so that in industrial production, especially in capital construction, there was a blind rash advance tendency. As a result, an artificial state of tension was formed between superiors and subordinates, left and right, and neighbors, and finally, we had to change the plan midway. We feel from this that in production and construction undertakings, in order to avoid the two tendencies of conservatism and rashness, local areas, like the central government, must strengthen planning work based on the requirements of the proportionate development of the national economy. At the same time, whether it is the local party committee or various economic departments, we must emphasize thorough investigation and research; emphasize starting from reality, oppose subjectivism and bureaucracy; emphasize that the part is subordinate to the whole, and that the local area is subordinate to the central government, and oppose departmentalism and localism. Only in this way can we comply with the objective laws of industrial and agricultural development and effectively promote the common upsurge of industry and agriculture.

    正确处理工农业关系，促进工农业共同高涨
    中共山西省委员会第一书记　陶鲁笳同志的发言
    我完全同意刘少奇同志的政治报告、邓小平同志关于修改党章的报告和周恩来同志关于第二个五年计划的建议的报告。现在，我就山西省的情况，对工业和农业的关系问题讲一点意见。
      山西有着发展工业的有利条件。它有丰富的地下资源，据地质部门的资料，已经发现的矿产资源有五十四种之多，其中煤的蕴藏量就有四千亿吨左右；它现在已经有一定的现代工业的基础；它的地理位置又处在包头钢铁基地和三门峡水电站之间。这就决定了，山西必将发展成为一个以重工业为主的工业基地，我们的一切工作必须围绕着工业建设特别是重工业建设这一中心环节去进行。
    要发展工业必须相应地发展农业。而在山西发展农业也有着良好的条件。首先，农业的社会主义改造已经胜利地完成了。这就从生产关系上，消除了社会主义工业化和小农经济之间存在着的矛盾。其次，农业资源也是很丰富的，除开多种多样的粮食作物以外，还有大宗的棉花、麻类、烤烟、油料等经济作物和不断增长着的皮毛、蚕丝、干果、水果、药材、木材以及其它各种山货等。同时，在实现了农业合作化之后，农民的社会主义积极性是空前高涨的，他们以史无前例的创造性劳动，进行着水土保持、植树造林、兴修小型水利、改进农业生产技术、发展畜牧业等生产建设事业，开始展示出了农、林、牧、副全面发展的远大前景。
    然而，向前看，由于工业正在高速度地发展，年年增长的商品粮食和工业原料的需要同现时还很低的农业生产水平之间的矛盾，在今后若干年内还是会继续存在的。因此，正如毛泽东同志在“关于农业合作化问题”一文中所指出的，“我们对于工业和农业、社会主义的工业化和社会主义的农业改造这样两件事，决不可以分割起来和互相孤立起来去看，决不可以只强调一方面，减弱另一方面。”
    为了适应农业技术改革的需要，地方工业应该积极地逐步地发展中小型的机械工厂和肥料工厂
    我们的农业改造，有着社会改革和技术改革的两方面的历史任务。要完成后一个任务比之合作化是更为长期和艰巨的。这是因为重工业不但在目前而且在今后若干年内还不可能大量地供给农业以现代化的技术装备。那么，在今后一个时期内，我们应该怎样去看待农业的技术改革问题呢？有的同志认为，在目前的条件下，我们只能等待大量拖拉机的到来，而无需提出农业技术改革的方针。我们认为，农业的技术改革应该包含两个方面的内容，即生产工具的现代化和生产方法的科学成就的采用（包括我们祖先遗留下来的好的有用的经验）。因此，不能简单地把它看作是一个拖拉机的问题。在目前的条件下，强调农业机械化，固然是不现实的。但是，农业的技术改革在目前决不是无事可做，而是有许多事情可做的，采取消极等待的态度是不对的。我们认为，农业的技术改革，也应该采取由低到高、逐步前进的办法，并且在大规模的技术改革到来之前，应该有一个充分的准备步骤。少奇同志的报告中所指出的各项农业技术措施，正是我们目前农业技术改革的重要内容。事实上，在合作化之后，农民过去的那种技术上的守旧习惯，已经有了很大的改变。他们越来越积极地要求工业给农业以技术援助，特别是在工具改良、化学肥料和水利建设等方面。现在，我们的工业能够给农业以怎样的技术援助呢？就山西的地方工业来说，不久以前，我们作了一个今后七年的初步规划。依照这个规划，将在全省各地逐步地建立起修配、制造新式农具和供农田水利使用的小型机械的工厂的体系；利用窝子铁矿，扩建和新建两个小型的钢铁厂，以供地方工业需用的钢铁；利用本省的资源，建成中小型的磷肥、骨肥、泥炭肥料、黑矾、硫酸钙肥料等八十八个厂，年产肥料可达到八十万吨左右；农药制造年产量可达到三万吨以上；就地取材，建立两个中小型水泥厂，以供农业水利建设的需要。现在农村小型水力发电站已经建成了两个，今后将逐年有所增加。所有这些，无疑地将促进农业技术水平的提高，新的技术人才的生长，和农业生产力的迅速发展。这些工业企业，一般是规模小，建设快，投资少，收效大，过去三年，我们地方国营工业用于这方面的投资只占总投资的百分之二，显然，这是一个缺点。今后，应该适当地有计划地增加对这方面的投资。
    要把地方工业和农业的发展结合起来进行规划，以便发挥轻工业和农业相互促进的作用
    为了促进农业的发展，同时，为了给重工业建设积累更多的资金，还必须足够估计到轻工业的作用。我们的地方工业在发展轻工业方面，是有着很多的便利条件的。过去，我们对于轻工业的作用认识不够明确，把对工业和农业的规划互相分割开来，而没有足够地注意它们相互间的联系；在第一个五年计划的前三年内，地方国营工业用于发展轻工业的投资只占总投资的百分之三十五，而用于发展农副业产品加工工业的投资仅占百分之○点六。结果，去年大量的水果、山货、药材等，由于没有加工工业而发生了无人收购的情况，致使农民很不满意。最近，我们经过调查分析，了解到全省的地方工业和农业资源有以下三种不同的情况：第一种是，原料充足，如水果、干果等，但加工或制造的工厂很少或者没有；第二种是，现有的工厂的设备能力大，如面粉厂，但原料不足；第三种是，现有的原料不多，但质量很好，有发展前途，如雁北的亚麻和糖萝卜，现在也没有相应的工厂。据此，我们在制定今后七年发展地方工业的规划中，对轻工业的发展作了适当的安排。预计在七年内轻工业的产值将比一九五五年增长三倍。这样，由于棉纺织工业的发展，将促进晋南、晋中产棉区的农业生产迅速高涨。同时由于亚麻纺织、缫丝、毛织、皮革、造纸、果品加工、淀粉、酿造、榨油等轻工业的发展，也将促进全省百分之七十的山区的农业经济扩大再生产的能力，从而得以逐步地改变山区的贫困落后的现状。特别是由于把工业和农业结合起来进行了规划，就使农村工作干部的思想跳出了过去那种只注意农业而忽视工业发展的狭小圈子。
    在发展轻工业上，还必须注意近海地区和内地的关系问题。为了合理地解决这个问题，我们认为，随着生产的发展和人民购买力的不断提高，可以采取下列的三条办法：一、近海城市的轻工业着重生产全国性需要的产品和较为高级的日用消费品，内地的轻工业则就地取材，就地加工或制造，着重生产为满足本地劳动群众所需要的产品；二、同类的轻工业产品，在出售的时候，实行优质优价，次质次价；三、对某些供过于求的产品，由国家进行全国平衡，加以必要的控制。当然，内地在发展轻工业的时候，在原料上应该注意近海城市的轻工业的需要；在技术上要向近海城市的轻工业学习，借以克服存在着的落后状态。
    为了调节和促进工农业的发展，应该改变商业工作的经营办法工农业生产的缺点和它们相互间的某些矛盾现象，常常会很敏感地反映到商品流通过程中来。在这里，如果商业工作做得好，就可以调节和促进工农业的发展。如果相反，就会助长工农业间矛盾的发展。因此，必须加强商业工作，以利于从经济上来巩固工农联盟。
    几年来，社会主义商业在稳定物价、保证需要和对私营工商业的社会主义改造等方面，都起到了重要的作用。这是应该肯定的。但在目前社会改革已经取得决定性的胜利的情况下，过去用于限制资本主义的许多办法就不再适用了。事实证明，商业部门那种条条集中过多，市场管理过严，归口分工过细过死，包购包销的范围过广，清规戒律过多，以及由上而下盲目地分配商品等作法，已经在商品流通中产生了很多弊病，群众对此意见很多，现在是到了必须迅速加以改变的时候了。
    最近四个月我们在太谷县进行了商业体制改革的典型试验。我们体会到，当前最重要的事情，是要使所有的商业工作人员善于适应新的环境，认真地学会做生意；要在国营商业的统一领导下，组织必要的自由市场；要适当地扩大县、市营商业的自治权利，并且要在经济核算的基础上实行利润分成和超额奖励的制度。据此，我们在太谷县：建立起新型的农村初级市场，活跃农民间互通有无的贸易；允许县城里的公私合营商业人员和小商小贩下乡进行又购又销的商业活动，打破供销合作社分割与独占农村市场的局面；有步骤地实行由下而上的选购和要货制度，并且允许打破地区的界限购进货物；允许县营、公私合营工业企业和手工业生产合作社对于自己的产品，除开商业部门收购的以外，都有自销的权利；在不提高出售价的前提下，适当提高某些农产品的收购价；采取按质分等论价的办法，适当降低某些质量较差的产品的价格；合理地调整山区和平川的地区差价。以上种种措施，受到了城乡群众的热烈欢迎；初步扭转了过去国营、合作社营商业只此一家别无分店的“官字号”作风，以及过去商业人员只注意为完成上级所给的卖钱额和收购量的任务，而不注意调查市场和人民需要的主观主义作风。自从实行这种商业体制改革以来，商业人员学习做生意的积极性提高了；县委对商业工作的领导也大大加强了；城乡各种商业的经营额都迅速地增长了；国家的利润和税收也随着增加了。而最重要的收获，还在于这样做，既满足了城乡群众的需要，又有效地促进着县营工业、手工业和农副业的发展。
    强调调查研究，加强计划工作，避免保守和冒进的两种偏向
    综上所述，为了正确地处理工农业之间的关系，以促进工农业的共同高涨，地方党委的任务是要在中央的统一领导下，加强对计划经济的全面领导，有效地组织和发挥工业、农业、商业等各个经济部门的相互促进和相互制约的作用。为此，就必须使重工业和轻工业、工业和农业的发展保持正确的比例。过去我们对于这一点，在道理上是懂得的，但在实际工作中，却缺乏认真的调查研究，因而常常是心中无数。我们和有些经济部门，当去年中央提倡节约的时候，曾片面地强调了各个经济部门之间的相互制约的作用，而产生了右的保守主义的偏向；相反，今年上半年，当中央提出了反对右倾保守思想之后，又曾片面地强调了各个经济部门之间的相互促进的作用，没有注意到重工业、轻工业和农业之间的发展比例，而且也没有注意到这个比例包含着局部和整体、中央和地方、城市和乡村、近海地区和内地等一系列的复杂关系，以致在工业生产中，特别是在基本建设工作中，又产生了盲目冒进的偏向。结果，上下左右四邻之间形成了人为的紧张状态，终于不得不中途变更计划。我们由此感到，在生产建设事业中，为了避免时而保守、时而冒进的两种偏向，地方和中央一样也必须根据国民经济按比例发展的要求来加强计划工作。同时无论地方党委或各个经济部门，都要强调周密的调查研究；强调从实际出发，反对主观主义和官僚主义；强调局部服从整体，强调地方服从中央，反对本位主义和地方主义。只有这样，才符合工农业发展的客观规律，才能有效地促进工农业的共同高涨。
