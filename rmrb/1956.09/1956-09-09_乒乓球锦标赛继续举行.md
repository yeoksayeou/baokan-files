Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 8th. Wang Chuanyao, a player known for his sharp smashes and sixth place finisher in last year's national men's singles table tennis competition, unexpectedly defeated last year's national champion, Jiang Yongning, by a score of three to two in the second day of the finals of the 1956 National Table Tennis Championships on the 7th. This victory brought a new mystery to the Wuhan audience trying to predict who will win the national championship this year.

Jiang Yongning adopted a frequent attacking strategy in the first game on the evening of the 7th, and once defeated the inexperienced Zhuang Jiafu by three to zero (21 to 12, 20 to 8, 21 to 9). However, in the second game, he was subjected to Wang Chuanyao's fierce attack.

Wang Chuanyao also played two games on the evening of the 7th. In the first game, he defeated Guangzhou player Liang Zhitao by three to zero.

As of the 7th, the situation was as follows: In the seven finals, Jiang Yongning had played four games (three wins, one loss); Wang Chuanyao had played three games, winning all three. The other four players competing for the national championship, Wang Xitian (fourth place last year), Lin Jinyuan from Guangzhou, Liu Guozhang from Shanghai, and Hu Bingquan from Beijing, failed to maintain an undefeated record.

In the women's competition, Sun Meiying, who was unable to participate in the national competition last year due to illness, became the most promising player to win the national championship in the women's group after defeating last year's national champion, Qiu Zhonghui, by three to zero on the evening of the 7th. Qiu Zhonghui, who is only twenty years old, has clearly improved her table tennis skills compared to last year, and Sun Meiying, who is good at fierce smashes, did not win easily. The scores of the three games were very close: 22 to 20, 21 to 18, 21 to 17.

In the women's group, Ye Peiqiong, the fifth-place finisher in the national competition last year, unexpectedly defeated last year's national runner-up, Zhang Baodi, by a score of three to two on the evening of the 6th, and then defeated Wang Qi, a female player from Harbin, by three to zero on the evening of the 7th, becoming a strong rival to Sun Meiying in the competition for the national championship.

### 乒乓球锦标赛继续举行

    乒乓球锦标赛继续举行
    据新华社武汉8日电　以急劲抽杀著称的去年全国乒乓球男子单打第六名选手王传耀，7日在1956年全国乒乓球锦标赛决赛第二天的比赛中，出人意料地以三比二击败了去年的全国冠军姜永宁，给预测谁将获得这次锦标赛全国冠军的武汉市观众带来新的谜。
    姜永宁7日晚在第一场比赛中采取频繁的攻击，曾经以三比零（二十一比十二、二十比八、二十一比九）战胜了缺乏经验的庄家富。但是在第二场比赛中，他却受到了王传耀的猛烈攻击。
    王传耀7日晚也进行了两场比赛。第一场他以三比零击败了广州市选手梁志滔。
    到7日止的情况是这样的：在七场决赛中姜永宁已经赛了四场（胜三场、败一场）；王传耀赛了三场，胜三场。其他四名争夺全国冠军的选手王锡添（去年的第四名）和广州市选手林金源、上海市选手刘国璋、北京市选手胡柄权都没能保持不败的纪录。
    在女子组的比赛中，去年因病没能参加全国比赛的孙梅英，7日晚以三比零战胜了去年的全国冠军丘钟惠以后，成为女子组最有希望获得全国冠军的选手。年仅二十岁的丘钟惠的乒乓球技术显然比去年有了提高，善于猛烈抽杀的孙梅英赢她并不是很顺利的。三局的比数都很接近：二十二比二十、二十一比十八、二十一比十七。
    在女子组中，去年全国第五名选手叶佩琼在6日晚出人意料地以三比二战胜了去年全国亚军章宝娣，7日晚又以三比零击败了哈尔滨的女选手汪奇，成为同孙梅英争夺全国冠军的劲敌。
