Statement by Comrade Wang Shoudao, Director of the Sixth Office of the State Council

The Central Committee's political report, the proposal for the Second Five-Year Plan, and the report on amending the Party Constitution summarize our Party's extremely rich experience in politics, economy, culture, and Party building. These have great historical significance for China's socialist construction and the world's peaceful, democratic, and socialist cause. In the reports by Comrades Liu Shaoqi and Zhou Enlai, the execution of the First Five-Year Plan for transportation and postal services was mentioned, and the tasks of the Second Five-Year Plan were pointed out. I fully agree with these.

In the past few years, transportation and postal work has basically adapted to the needs of developing the national economy. However, a contradiction has already emerged between transportation capacity and freight volume. During the Second Five-Year Plan, freight volume will increase even more, and this contradiction may become more acute. If effective measures are not taken promptly, the transportation industry may become a weak link in the development of the national economy. In postal services, there are also situations and problems in some areas where communication capacity does not meet the needs.

At present, a tense situation has already appeared on the transportation front. The throughput capacity of some sections of the Beijing-Hankou, Longhai, and Shijiazhuang-Taiyuan railways has reached saturation. Some have used up all their reserve capacity and still cannot meet the needs. On the Yangtze River and coastal Bohai Sea routes, the tonnage of ships is insufficient, and the handling capacity of Shanghai Port and major ports along the Yangtze River is inadequate. Many provinces, especially in the Northwest and Southwest regions, have few operating vehicles, and road conditions are poor, resulting in the accumulation of large quantities of goods and passengers being unable to buy train or boat tickets. Many passengers stranded at stations and ports lament "the difficulty of travel." The reasons for this tense transportation situation are: On the one hand, the rapid growth of freight volume. For example, the freight volume expected to be completed this year by railways, operating vehicles, and civil aviation will approach or exceed the level stipulated for 1957 in the First Five-Year Plan. On the other hand, the original transportation lines and equipment in our country are few in number, technically backward, and extremely unevenly distributed. The newly added transportation lines and equipment cannot keep up with the rate of increase in freight volume. The arrangement of new construction and renovation projects and their progress is not well integrated with transportation needs. The originally planned technical transformation of operating railways has not been completed. At the same time, the comprehensive utilization of various modes of transportation is not well organized, and unreasonable transportation phenomena such as duplication, counterflow, excessive distances, and detours still exist. In addition, there are still many shortcomings in business management, which further increases the tension in transportation.

How to solve the contradiction between transportation capacity and the ever-increasing freight volume?

Actively expand the transportation network and improve engineering quality

According to the requirements of the planned (proportionate) development of the socialist economy, it is necessary to develop the transportation industry correspondingly while focusing on the development of heavy industry. This is because modern large-scale production cannot proceed smoothly without corresponding transportation conditions. The guiding principle for developing China's transportation industry is to gradually adopt advanced technology, expand the construction of the transportation network, and technically transform the original technically backward transportation equipment through several Five-Year Plans, based on the needs and possible conditions of the country. The aim is to gradually build China's transportation industry into a modern transportation network with railways as the backbone, linking waterways, highways, and civil aviation.

The existing transportation lines and equipment in our country, whether in terms of line length or equipment quantity, are still unable to meet objective needs. Therefore, it is necessary to actively expand the transportation network, mainly by building new railway lines. At the same time, special attention should be paid to transportation construction in ethnic minority areas. At present, poor engineering quality in capital construction is still a very serious problem. Newly built railways have serious defects, some equipment is incomplete, or related operational projects are too backward to be delivered for use in a timely manner. Some of the roads built are of poor quality, which affects the driving of vehicles. Therefore, in future capital construction work, it is necessary to overcome the tendency to unilaterally pursue quantity and ignore quality, strengthen overall planning, and conduct comprehensive arrangements from surveying and design to construction and delivery for use.

Strengthen the technical transformation of existing lines and equipment

The construction of new industrial bases in the interior of our country mainly relies on the support of the original industrial bases in the coastal areas. In the next few years, a large amount of material transportation will still be concentrated on the existing transportation lines. Moreover, with the further upsurge of the national economy, the freight volume undertaken by the existing transportation lines will become even heavier. In order to further tap the potential of existing transportation lines and equipment, it is not enough to rely solely on organizational measures and increased labor intensity. Therefore, the technical transformation of existing transportation lines and equipment must be strengthened. Any idea or practice that neglects or relaxes the technical transformation of existing transportation lines and equipment is unfavorable. It should be pointed out that in the past few years, the transportation department has not grasped the technical transformation of existing transportation lines and equipment tightly enough. For example, the investment in the technical transformation of operating railways stipulated in the First Five-Year Plan, plus the amount expected to be completed in the first three years and this year, is only 50% to 60%. When conducting technical transformation of the transportation industry, it must be based on China's resource situation, economic and technological development level, and international cooperation conditions. It is one-sided and unrealistic to deviate from these conditions, to demand large-scale transformation while neglecting small-scale transformation, and to demand too much increase in new equipment while neglecting the use of existing equipment. Therefore, when formulating the overall plan for technical transformation and the phased annual implementation plan, it is necessary to consider both the requirements for developing the transportation industry and the actual possible conditions, and to maintain balanced development in all internal links of the transportation industry. At the same time, various modes of transportation should be connected to each other, such as increasing the construction of water-land combined transportation terminals and building water-land amphibious containers (boxes for concentrating loose goods).

During the Second Five-Year Plan, the main contents of technical transformation are:

In terms of railways: First, the issue of power transformation. Under the current conditions, electric locomotives and internal combustion locomotives cannot be used in large quantities; they can only be used in small quantities in certain sections with large slopes, large freight volume, or water shortages. Steam locomotives should still be the main power source at present. For example, the use of 1-5-1 type steam locomotives on lines like Beijing to Shanhaiguan can haul 4,040 tons, which is about 1,300 tons more per train than the Mikha-1 type locomotive. Second, build double tracks on the main trunk lines. The throughput capacity of double tracks can be increased by 100% to 150% compared to single tracks. There are very few double tracks on China's railways. During the Second Five-Year Plan, the sections of the railway from Harbin via Shenyang, Beijing, Hankou to Hengyang that are currently single tracks will all be built into double tracks, and most sections of the Beijing-Baotou and Shijiazhuang-Taiyuan lines will also be built into double tracks. Third, accelerate the construction of hub stations, and extend and increase the number of station tracks. At present, some hub stations on China's railways are often congested due to insufficient lines and capacity. During the Second Five-Year Plan, mechanized hump marshalling yards should be built in hub stations with national significance; non-mechanized hump or small hump marshalling yards should be built in other large hub stations. With the increase in the traction weight of trains, the station lines should also be increased and extended accordingly. Fourth, continue to install automatic and semi-automatic train blocking devices on certain trunk lines. This device can increase the line throughput capacity by 20% on single tracks and more than 100% on double tracks. Fifth, rebuild lines and tunnels, improve the load-bearing capacity of bridges, increase passenger cars, large freight cars, and special vehicles, and improve various equipment for passenger service and freight transportation.

In terms of water transportation: First, strengthen the technical transformation of ports, improve handling capacity, and gradually add loading and unloading machinery and equipment; focus on the construction of water-land combined transportation terminals; major coastal ports should gradually add radio and radar navigation equipment; small inland river ports should increase cargo holds, trestle bridges, and other berthing equipment. Second, except for oil tankers, ocean-going vessels, and some passenger-cargo vessels, newly built vessels should generally still use improved steam engines as the main power source for coastal and inland river vessels; actively adopt various advanced technologies to transform existing vessels; and gradually simplify ship types. Third, extend the navigable channels for tugboats, blast reefs, dredge shallows, add navigation marks, and actively improve navigation conditions.

In terms of highways: Local materials should be used, such as using gravel and weathered stone to improve road surfaces, improve the load-bearing capacity of bridges, add traffic signs, and improve station equipment; modify and manufacture trailers and alternative fuel vehicles.

In addition, technical improvements should also be actively carried out on folk transportation tools such as wooden sailing boats and animal-drawn vehicles, so as to better combine them with modern transportation tools and exert greater transportation efficiency.

In terms of civil aviation: Add new types of fast transport aircraft with excellent high-altitude performance, and gradually build a national system of navigation networks based on trunk lines to ensure safe day and night flight.

All these technical transformation projects and progress must be combined with long-term plans. Furthermore, scientific research work should be strengthened accordingly, and technical cadres should be vigorously trained.

Promote rational transportation and reasonably utilize various transportation tools

Reasonably utilizing various transportation tools and promoting rational transportation are important sources for improving transportation capacity. According to the rational flow of materials, combined with the distribution of transportation tools, the transportation of major materials should be able to use various transportation tools more rationally through national transportation plans and freight rate regulations. The experience of the rationally transported coal, grain, and regional production and sales balance system and the unified delivery system of coal, wood, and cement that have been implemented proves that the rational transportation system and the unified delivery system can not only save national transportation capacity and transportation costs, but also have an important promoting effect on the comprehensive integration of production, transportation, and sales. In the future, production and sales departments should establish transportation agencies and sales agencies, and gradually implement a rational transportation system and a unified delivery system in the transportation of major materials.

In order to adapt to the rapid development of the rural economy and expand the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, local transportation undertakings should be vigorously developed, and special attention should be paid to giving full play to the role of folk transportation tools such as wooden sailing boats and animal-drawn vehicles.

Maintaining a certain transportation reserve force is extremely important, whether from the perspective of completing urgent and concentrated transportation tasks, coping with possible unexpected difficulties, or from the perspective of national defense needs. Relevant departments must deeply understand the importance of this issue, realistically calculate the capacity and reserve force of each transportation line, and strictly maintain the prescribed reserve force.

Plan the development of postal and telecommunications construction and give full play to the effectiveness of existing communication equipment

I would also like to offer some opinions on postal and telecommunications.

At present, the main problems existing in postal and telecommunications communications are that long-distance calls between important cities and local calls in many cities cannot meet objective needs. For example, major trunk lines such as Beijing-Hankou, Beijing-Shanghai, and Beijing-Shenyang are congested, calls are slow, and waiting times are too long; communication capacity within provinces is also very weak; the demand for local calls in many large and medium-sized cities exceeds supply, and "busy signals" and "lines occupied" are often encountered; new industrial bases lack communication equipment. The reasons for the tense communication situation are mainly that communication construction lags behind the development of the national economy, the existing communication network is unreasonably organized, the technical equipment is outdated and inferior, and the capacity is insufficient. Also, some cities and new industrial bases have failed to incorporate communication construction into the overall plan. Often, communication construction requirements are only raised after factory buildings are completed and roads are repaired, thus creating a contradiction between communication capacity and communication needs.

In order to adapt to the ever-increasing communication needs, first, a national postal and telecommunications network plan must be formulated, new technologies must be gradually adopted, and necessary technical transformations must be carried out. During the Second Five-Year Plan, underground cables should be laid on major long-distance trunk lines, multi-channel carrier machines should be used as a priority, microwave relay communication equipment should be newly built, automatic or semi-automatic switching equipment for telegrams and telephones should be installed in communication center cities; the number of local telephones in large and medium-sized cities should be appropriately increased; and the transmission capacity of radio should be enhanced. Second, attention must be paid to giving full play to the effectiveness of existing communication equipment, making full use of wireless communication equipment; small exchanges provided by users themselves should be widely used for local telephones. Third, rural telephones should be gradually constructed according to local financial resources, equipment supply, and technical conditions. Fourth, the construction of cities and new industrial bases must incorporate postal and telecommunications construction into the overall plan to avoid mutual disconnection.

The transportation industry and the postal and telecommunications industry are the links connecting industry and agriculture, cities and villages, production and consumption. They are pioneer enterprises for the development of the national economy. They undertake huge transportation and communication tasks. I fully believe that under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and the care of the entire Party, relying on the efforts of all staff and workers in the transportation and postal sectors, the transportation and postal departments will definitely be able to quickly overcome the shortcomings in their work, further develop and transform China's transportation and postal undertakings, and better promote the development of China's great socialist construction cause.

    发展和改造我国的运输业和邮电业
    国务院第六办公室主任　王首道同志的发言
    中央委员会的政治报告、第二个五年计划的建议的报告和修改党的章程的报告，总结了我党在政治、经济、文化和党的建设等方面极为丰富的工作经验，这对我国社会主义建设和世界和平民主社会主义事业都有着伟大的历史意义。在刘少奇同志和周恩来同志的报告中，都提到了运输和邮电第一个五年计划的执行情况，并指出了第二个五年计划的任务，这些，我都完全同意。
    过去几年来，运输和邮电工作，基本上适应了发展国民经济的需要。但是，目前已经出现了运输能力与运量之间不相适应的矛盾，在第二个五年计划期间，运量还将有更大的增长，这个矛盾还有可能更加尖锐，如果不及早采取有效措施，那么，运输业就可能成为国民经济发展中的薄弱环节。在邮电方面，某些地区也有通信能力与需要不相适应的情况和问题。
    目前，在运输战线上已经出现了紧张局面。京汉、陇海、石太等铁路的某些区段的通过能力，有的已达饱和程度，有的虽然用掉了全部后备力量，还是不能适应需要；长江和沿海北洋航线上，船舶吨位不够，上海港和长江各主要港口的吞吐能力已经不足；许多省份特别是西北、西南地区，营业汽车少，公路的路况不良；以致大批物资积压，旅客买不到车票、船票，许多耽搁在车站和港口的旅客们感叹“行路难”。形成这种运输紧张局面的原因，一方面，是由于运量的急剧增长，如铁路、营业汽车和民用航空，今年预计完成的货运量，将接近或超过第一个五年计划规定的一九五七年的水平。另一方面，主要是由于我国原有运输线路和设备数量少，技术装备落后、分布又极不平衡；新增的运输线路和设备跟不上运量上涨的速度，新建改建的项目和进度的安排，与运输需要结合得还不够好，营业铁路原定的技术改造计划没有完成；同时，各种运输工具的综合利用组织得还不好，重复、对流、过远、迂回等不合理运输的现象仍然存在，以及经营管理工作中还存在着不少的缺点，这就更增加了运输的紧张程度。
    如何解决运输能力与日益增长的运量之间不相适应的矛盾呢？
    积极扩大运输网，提高工程质量
    按照社会主义经济有计划（按比例）发展的要求，必须在以发展重工业为中心的同时，相应地发展运输业。这是因为，近代化的大生产，如果没有相适应的交通运输条件，生产就不能顺利进行。发展我国运输业的方针，就是要根据国家的需要和可能条件，通过几个五年计划，有步骤地采用先进技术，扩大运输网的建设和对原有技术落后的运输设备进行技术改造，把我国的运输业，逐步建成为一个以铁路为主干的联结水路、公路和民用航空的现代化的运输网。
    我国现有的运输线路和设备，无论在线路长度或在设备数量方面，都还不能满足客观需要。因此，必须积极地扩大运输网，主要是修筑新的铁路线。同时，应特别注意少数民族地区的交通建设。目前，在基本建设工作中，工程质量不好，仍然是很严重的问题：新建的铁路，有的病害严重，有的设备不全或有关运营的工程过于落后，不能及时交付使用；修建的公路，有的质量低劣，影响车辆行驶。因此，在今后基本建设工作中，必须克服片面追求数量、忽视质量的偏向，加强总体规划，并从勘测设计、施工到交付使用，进行全面的统筹安排。
    加强对现有线路和设备的技术改造
    我国内地新工业基地的建设，主要还是依靠近海地区原有工业基地来支援，在今后若干年内，大量的物资运输仍将集中在现有运输线路上。而且，随着国民经济进一步的高涨，现有运输线路所承担的运量，会更加繁重起来。为了进一步发挥现有运输线路和设备的潜力，单凭组织措施、提高劳动强度，已经是不够的了。因此，必须加强对现有运输线路和设备的技术改造。任何忽视或放松对现有运输线路和设备，进行技术改造的想法和做法，都是不利的。应该指出：几年来，运输部门对现有运输线路和设备的技术改造是抓得不够紧的，如第一个五年计划规定的营业铁路技术改造投资额，前三年加上今年预计完成的数目，只有百分之五十至百分之六十。在对运输业进行技术改造时，必须根据我国的资源情况、经济和技术发展水平，以及国际协作等条件来进行，脱离这些条件，要求大改造而忽视小改造，过多地要求增加新式装备而忽视利用原有设备的想法和做法，都是片面的和不现实的。因此，在制定技术改造的总体规划和分期分年实施方案时，既要根据发展运输业的要求，又要考虑实际的可能条件，并使运输业的内部各个环节，保持均衡地发展，同时，应使各种运输工具相互衔接，如增建水陆联运码头、建造水陆两用的集装箱（集中盛放零散货物的箱子）等。
    在第二个五年计划期内，进行技术改造的主要内容：
    在铁路方面：首先，是动力的改造问题。在目前的条件下，电气机车、内燃机车还不可能大量采用；只能在某些坡度大、运量大或缺水的区段上，少量地分别采用，蒸汽机车仍应是目前主要的动力。例如采用1—5—1型蒸汽机车，在像北京到山海关这样的线路上，可以牵引四千零四十吨，比米卡一型机车，每列车可多拉一千三百吨左右。其次，在主要的干线上修建复线。复线的通过能力可比单线增加一倍到一倍半。我国铁路的复线很少，在第二个五年计划期内，将把从哈尔滨经沈阳、北京、汉口到衡阳的铁路中目前还是单线的线路，全部建成复线，京包、石太等线的大部分区段也将修成复线。第三，加速枢纽站的建设，延长和增加车站股道。现在我国铁路上的某些枢纽站，由于线路不足，能力不够，经常发生堵塞现象。第二个五年计划期内，应在具有全国意义的枢纽站，修建机械化驼峰调车场；在其他大的枢纽站，分别建设非机械化驼峰或小型驼峰调车场。随着列车牵引重量的提高，还应分别增加和延长站线。第四，在某些干线上，继续装设自动和半自动的行车闭塞装置。这种装置，在单线上可提高线路通过能力百分之二十，复线上可提高一倍以上。第五，改建线路和隧道，提高桥梁的负荷能力，增加客车、大型货车和特种车辆，改善为旅客服务和货物运输的各种设备。
    在水运方面：首先，要加强港口的技术改造，提高吞吐能力，逐步增添装卸机械设备；有重点地建设水、陆联运码头；沿海大港应逐步增设无线电、雷达导航设备；内河小港要增加囤船、栈桥等靠船设备。其次，新建船舶除油轮、远洋海轮和部分客货轮外，沿海和内河船舶，一般仍应以采用改良的蒸汽机为主；对现有船舶，应积极采用各种先进技术加以改造；并逐步简化船型。第三，延长通行轮驳船的航道，炸除礁石，疏浚浅滩，增设航标，积极改善航行条件。
    在公路方面：应就地取材，如采用砂砾、风化石等材料改善路面，提高桥梁负荷能力，添设行车标志，改善车站设备；改装和制造挂车和代燃车。
    此外，对木帆船、兽力车等民间运输工具，也应积极进行技术改良，以便更好地和近代运输工具相结合，发挥更大的运输效能。
    在民用航空方面：增添新型的并具有优良高空性能的快速运输机，逐步建成以干线为主的全国系统的导航网，保证日夜安全飞行。
    所有这些技术改造的项目和进度，必须与远景规划相结合。并且，还要相应地加强科学研究工作和大力培养技术干部。
    推行合理运输，合理地利用各种运输工具
    合理地利用各种运输工具，推行合理运输，是提高运输能力的重要源泉。必须按照物资的合理流向，结合运输工具的分布情况，通过国家运输计划和运价规定等，使主要物资的运输，能够更合理地使用各种运输工具。根据已推行的煤炭、粮食分区产销平衡合理运输制度和煤炭、木材、水泥统一送货制度的经验证明：合理运输制度和统一送货制度，不仅可节省国家运输力和运输费用，而且对产、运、销的全面结合具有重要的促进作用。今后，产销部门应建立运输机构和销售机构，在主要物资的运输中，逐步推行合理运输制度和统一送货制度。
    为了适应农村经济的迅速发展和扩大城乡物资交流的需要，应大力发展地方运输事业，特别应注意充分发挥木帆船、兽力车等民间运输工具的作用。
    经常保持一定的运输后备力量，无论从完成紧急的集中的运输任务、应付可能发生的意外困难，无论从国防需要上着眼，都是一个极关重要的问题。有关部门必须深刻认识这个问题的重要性，切实计算每一条运输线路的能力和后备力量，并严格保持所规定的后备力量。
    有计划地发展邮电建设，充分发挥原有通信设备效能
    在邮电方面，我也讲一点意见。
    目前，邮电通信中存在的主要问题是，重要城市之间的长途电话和许多城市的市内电话已不能满足客观需要。例如：京汉、京沪、京沈等主要干线，电路拥塞，通话迟缓，等候时间过长；省内通信能力也很薄弱；许多大中城市的市内电话，供不应求，时常碰到“忙音”“占线”，新建工业基地则缺少通信设备。造成通信紧张的原因，主要是由于通信建设落后于国民经济的发展，现有通信网路组织不合理，技术设备陈旧低劣，容量不足，还由于某些城市和新工业基地，未能把通信建设纳入总体规划内，往往是在厂房建成、马路修好后，才提出通信建设的要求，因而产生了通信能力与通信需要之间不相适应的矛盾。
    为了适应日益增长的通信需要，首先，必须制定全国邮电通信网路的规划，逐步采用新技术，进行必要的技术改造。在第二个五年计划期间，在主要长途干线上敷设地下电缆，重点采用多路载波机，开始新建微波接力通信设备，在通信中心城市装设电报电话的自动或半自动接转设备；适当增加各大、中城市的市内电话；增强无线电的发射能力。其次，必须注意发挥原有通信设备的效能，充分利用无线通信设备；市内电话应广泛采用用户自备的小交换机。第三，乡村电话应根据地方财力、器材供应、技术条件，逐步进行建设。第四，城市和新工业基地的建设，必须把邮电建设纳入总体规划内，以免相互脱节。
    运输业和邮电业是联结工业和农业、城市和乡村、生产和消费的纽带，它是发展国民经济的先行企业，它担负着巨大的运输任务和通信任务，我完全相信：在党中央的正确领导和全党的关怀下，依靠运输和邮电部门全体职工的努力，运输和邮电部门，定能迅速地克服工作中的缺点，进一步发展和改造我国的运输和邮电事业，更好地促进我国伟大的社会主义建设事业的发展。
