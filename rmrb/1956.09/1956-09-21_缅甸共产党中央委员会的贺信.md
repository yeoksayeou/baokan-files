To the dear Comrades:
    We extend our respectful congratulations to the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China!
    The Communist Party of China is a party that has contributed to the treasure house of Marxism-Leninism. The Communist Party of China creatively applied Marxism-Leninism and liberated the entire China, the most populous country in the world, from the rule of imperialism and its puppets. The liberation of China is the greatest victory of the people after the October Socialist Revolution, and it is a very helpful example for colonial and semi-colonial countries that have not yet been liberated.
    The Communist Party of China is also creatively applying Marxism-Leninism according to its own conditions, and peacefully transitioning to socialism, which is also an example for those countries that have not yet built socialism.
    Today, despite the fact that some imperialist countries do not recognize the People's Republic of China led by the Communist Party of China, the situation has developed to such an extent that the cause of world peace cannot proceed without China's participation.
    Burma and China have been close and friendly neighbors since ancient times, and the formulation of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence has further strengthened the relationship between the Burmese and Chinese peoples. On this issue, we express our full support for the Burmese government's agreement to declare friendly relations with the People's Republic of China.
    Currently, the Burmese civil war has entered its ninth year. Although the Communist Party of Burma has made many efforts to stop the civil war and achieve domestic peace, the civil war that the people absolutely do not want is still going on. We firmly believe that Burma can stop the civil war and rebuild domestic peace. With this confidence, the Communist Party of Burma will work tirelessly with the masses of the people.
    We deeply believe that this congress will further advance the completion of China's socialist construction and will continue to develop and consolidate world peace.
    We wish the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China success!
    Long live the Communist Party of China!
    Long live the friendship and unity between Burma and China!
                    Central Committee of the Communist Party of Burma

### 缅甸共产党中央委员会的贺信

    缅甸共产党中央委员会的贺信亲爱的同志们：
    我们向中国共产党第八次代表大会致以尊敬的祝贺！
    中国共产党是一个对马克思列宁主义宝库作了贡献的党。中国共产党创造性地运用了马克思列宁主义，从帝国主义及其傀儡的统治下解放了世界上人口最多的整个中国。中国的解放，是继十月社会主义革命后最大的一次人民胜利，对于还没有得到解放的殖民地和半殖民地国家来说，是一个很有帮助的榜样。
    中国共产党还正在创造性地，按照自己的情况运用马克思列宁主义，和平地向社会主义过渡，这对于那些还没有建成社会主义的国家来说，也是一个榜样。
    今天，尽管有某些帝国主义国家不承认中国共产党领导的中华人民共和国，但是，形势已经发展到这样的程度：世界和平事业没有中国的参加是不行的。
    缅甸和中国从古以来就是亲密友善的邻邦，而和平共处的五项原则的制定使中缅人民的关系更加密切起来。在这个问题上，我们对同意宣布和中华人民共和国友好相处的缅甸政府表示完全支持。
    目前，缅甸内战已经进入了第九个年头。虽然缅甸共产党为了停止内战和实现国内和平作了多次努力，但是，人民所绝不愿意的内战还在继续进行着。我们完全相信，缅甸能够停止内战和重建国内和平。本此信心，缅甸共产党将和人民群众一道，百折不挠地奋斗下去。
    我们深深相信，这次大会将为完成中国社会主义建设向前推进一步，并将继续发展和巩固世界和平。
    祝中国共产党第八次代表大会成功！
    中国共产党万岁！
    缅中友谊、团结万岁！
                    缅甸共产党中央委员会
