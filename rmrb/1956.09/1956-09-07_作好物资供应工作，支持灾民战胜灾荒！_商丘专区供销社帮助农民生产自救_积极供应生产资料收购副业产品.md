    Do a Good Job in Material Supply and Support Disaster Victims to Overcome Natural Disasters!
    The Shangqiu Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative Helps Farmers Help Themselves Through Production, Actively Supplies Production Materials and Purchases Sideline Products
    (Our report) The supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels in Shangqiu Special District, Henan Province, have actively carried out supply and marketing businesses and helped the people in the disaster areas overcome natural disasters in many ways.
    In order to help farmers rescue local crops, the supply and marketing cooperatives of Xiangcheng, Shenqiu, Dancheng, Huaiyang, Luyi, Yongcheng, Xiayi, Taikang and other counties actively supplied and sold on credit a large number of chemical fertilizers and cake fertilizers, and adjusted and supplied more than 200,000 jin of various seeds. Fifteen grass-roots supply and marketing cooperatives transferred 2.25 million jin of cattle grass and more than 4,000 jin of sweet potato seedlings. The timely supply of these fertilizers and seeds greatly encouraged the production enthusiasm of the disaster victims. Wang Zizhu, a member of the Tianqimiao Township Agricultural Cooperative in Yongcheng County, said: "If it weren't for the supply and marketing cooperative selling fertilizer on credit, where would we have the money to buy it! Don't think the crops are flooded, they can still increase production with fertilizer!"
    In order to help the disaster victims build houses and sheds and rebuild their homes, the supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels actively supplied building materials such as wood, bamboo poles, reed mats, bricks, tiles, and lime. In order to facilitate the purchase of disaster victims, the cadres and vendors of the supply and marketing cooperatives jointly proposed: "Contract by area, and reach every village." They went to the disaster areas to deliver goods, supplying some daily necessities and cooking utensils urgently needed by the disaster victims. The Fourth District Supply and Marketing Cooperative of Xiangcheng organized 22 vendors to deliver goods 44 times in two days, passing through more than 200 villages. They also combined purchasing and barter trade to purchase eggs, pig iron, almonds, and waste products. Zhang Shucheng and Liu Guoqing, cadres of the Fourth District Supply and Marketing Cooperative, in order to deliver goods to the other side, tied ropes to the trees on both sides, and then borrowed a wooden beam. Each of them carried more than 30 kilograms of goods, rode on the beam, pulled the rope and crossed to the other side, so that the disaster victims surrounded by water could buy the things they urgently needed.
    In addition to actively supplying commodities, the supply and marketing cooperatives of various counties and districts also helped the disaster victims develop sideline businesses and purchased sideline products. The Third District of Xiangcheng convened a meeting of 19 senior cooperative directors and organized weaving groups, basket weaving groups, and wood industry groups. According to preliminary statistics in this county, 36 processing contracts have been signed with disaster victims for mats, baskets, wood goods, etc., with a total value of more than 14,000 yuan.
    In order to facilitate the masses and strive for more purchases, each grass-roots cooperative has increased the variety of purchases and expanded the purchasing power. Many grass-roots cooperatives also printed leaflets and promoted the products to be purchased by the supply and marketing cooperatives to the disaster victims at markets and meetings. After the Seventh District of Xiangcheng County launched the publicity campaign, a mass movement to collect medicinal materials was formed. Old lady Jiang Wangshi collected 24 jin of tribulus and 8 jin of fresh cattail flowers in two days. Up to now, the total value of medicinal materials purchased for disaster relief in the Chancheng District of Yongcheng County has reached more than 300,000 yuan. The Baoyuan Agricultural Cooperative in the Sixth District of Xiangcheng used more than 100 yuan of sideline income to buy 850 jin of sweet potato seedlings and planted 20 mu of land. Cooperative member Li Xiu said: "Wheat production has decreased. If it weren't for sideline business, let alone buying sweet potato seedlings, we wouldn't even have money to buy matches!"

    作好物资供应工作，支持灾民战胜灾荒！
    商丘专区供销社帮助农民生产自救
    积极供应生产资料收购副业产品
    本报讯　河南省商丘专区各级供销社积极开展了供销业务，从多方面帮助灾区人民战胜灾荒。
    项城、沈丘、郸城、淮阳、鹿邑、永城、夏邑、太康等县供销社，为了帮助农民抢救当地农作物，积极供应和赊销了大批化学肥料、饼肥，调剂和供应了各种种籽二十多万斤。十五个基层供销社调剂牛草二百二十五万斤，甘薯秧四千多斤。这些肥料和种籽的及时供应，大大鼓舞了灾民的生产情绪。永城县天齐庙乡农业社社员王自柱说：“要不是供销社赊销肥料，咱哪有钱买呢！不要看庄稼受水，有了肥料还能增产！”
    为帮助灾民盖房、搭棚，重建家园，各级供销社积极供应了木料、竹杆、苇席、砖、瓦和石灰等建筑器材。为了灾民购买方便，供销社的干部和商贩们一齐提出：“分片包干，村村都到。”他们分头涉水深入灾区送货，供应了灾民急需的一些日用百货和炊事用具等。项城四区供销社，组织商贩二十二人，两天涉水送货四十四次，经过村庄二百多个。他们还结合收购和以货换货的办法，收购了鸡蛋、生铁、杏仁和废品等。四区供销社干部张书成、刘国清，为了送货到对岸，将绳拴在两岸的树上，然后又借了一根木梁，每人扛着三十多斤重的货物骑在梁上拉着绳子渡到对岸，使被水围困的灾民买到了急需的东西。
    各县区供销社，除积极供应商品外，还帮助灾民开展副业，收购副业产品。项城三区召开了十九个高级社长会议，组织了编席组、编筐组、木业组等。据这个县初步统计，已同灾民签定席、筐、木货等加工合同三十六份，金额达一万四千多元。
    为方便群众，争取多收购，各基层社都增加了收购品种，扩大了收购力量。许多基层社还印发了传单，逢集、开会便向灾民宣传供销社要收购的产品。项城县七区开展宣传以后，形成了群众性的采集药材运动。老大娘蒋王氏，两天就采集蒺藜二十四斤，鲜莆花八斤。永城县酇城区到目前为止，因救灾收购的药材总值已达三十多万元。项城六区鲍园农业社，用副业收入一百多元，买了八百五十斤甘薯秧，栽地二十亩。社员李秀说：“麦子减产了，要不是搞副业，别说买红薯秧子，就是买火柴也没钱！”　　（王羡荣）
