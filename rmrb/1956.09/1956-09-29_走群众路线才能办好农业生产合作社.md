Comrade Jiang Weiqing, First Secretary of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, spoke as follows:

I fully endorse Comrade Mao Zedong's opening address and fully agree with the reports made by Comrades Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, and Deng Xiaoping on behalf of the Party Central Committee at the Eighth National Congress of the Party.

In the eleven years from the Seventh National Congress of the Party to the present, we have thoroughly completed the great bourgeois democratic revolution and have basically realized the great proletarian socialist revolution. The victory of these two great revolutions is the result of the entire Party correctly implementing the Party's political line, and it is also the result of the entire Party correctly implementing the Party's mass line. There is no doubt that in the future, in order to achieve new and greater victories in the Party's cause, it is necessary to continuously promote the tradition of the mass line in the Party's work under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong.

I would now like to talk about the issue of "democratic operation of cooperatives," which is to say, implementing the Party's mass line in agricultural producer cooperatives.

Currently, the number of farming households in Jiangsu province that have joined agricultural producer cooperatives accounts for 95.28 percent of the total number of farming households, of which 77.74 percent are participating in advanced cooperatives. After the rectification of cooperatives in the first half of this year, the vast majority have been consolidated, and productive forces have been further developed. In this year's summer harvest pre-distribution, although wheat suffered from torrential rains and production was lower than originally planned, 75 to 80 percent of the members still increased their income, while the other 20 to 25 percent did not increase their income or saw a decrease. Recently, we have been making every effort to improve the production work of the cooperatives, striving for a comprehensive and greater increase in autumn production to make up for the losses of the summer harvest, so that more than 90 percent of the members can increase their income, and the remaining members do not see a decrease, thus consolidating the victory already achieved and thoroughly completing the task of socialist transformation of agriculture this winter and next spring.

The Two Conditions for Consolidating Cooperatives

After the basic realization of agricultural cooperativization throughout the province, with the changes in the system of ownership and agricultural management methods, rural work has entered a new period. Under this new situation, the main tasks of rural work at present are, on the one hand, to economically help and lead the cooperatives, and on the basis of developing production, correctly implement the distribution policy that takes into account the interests of the state, the collective, and the individual, so that more than 90 percent of the members can increase their income; on the other hand, it is also necessary to politically and ideologically educate grassroots cadres to rely on the masses and learn to manage their own affairs, and to educate the masses to consolidate the collective and love the cooperative as their own home. These two aspects are indispensable. Without either aspect, it is impossible to truly consolidate the cooperatives. We believe that in order to give full play to the enthusiasm of the vast number of grassroots cadres and cooperative members, to run the existing cooperatives well, and to successfully complete future tasks, "democratic operation of cooperatives" is a fundamental issue, which is to say, adhering to the Party's mass line in agricultural cooperatives.

Under the leadership and education of the Party, grassroots cadres understand the importance of implementing the Party's mass line. The vast majority of them are from poor and lower-middle peasant backgrounds and have undergone the test of various revolutionary struggles for a considerable period of time, maintaining close ties with the broad masses of peasants. They work tirelessly year after year, rain or shine, and enthusiastically serve the masses, gaining their trust and love. In their work, they have relied on the wisdom and strength of the masses to complete the tasks assigned by the Party in each period, and have also accumulated considerable experience, possessing a certain level of political understanding. Precisely because of this, they have been able to lead more than 30 million working peasants in the province to organize a large number of cooperatives so quickly and in an orderly manner in the past year, and have established the production order of the cooperatives and launched a large-scale agricultural production increase campaign. Since this summer, they have continuously suffered from torrential rains and strong typhoons, and they have worked with the masses to carry out a victorious struggle against natural disasters, reducing losses to crops. Although they failed to complete the original summer harvest production increase plan, the output was still slightly higher than last year's summer harvest.

The Reasons for the Emergence of Commandism

However, after rural work entered a new period, many grassroots cadres did not have a sufficient understanding of this new situation, and therefore, some mistakes of commandism occurred in their work. When carrying out certain tasks, they lacked sufficient political and ideological work and often used administrative orders to apportion tasks. They lacked due attention and concern for some of the production and livelihood difficulties raised by the members. In their leadership work, when the masses did not understand and were unwilling to accept their proposals, instead of carrying out patient persuasion and education, they labeled the masses with "capitalist ideas" or "undermining collectivism"; sometimes, in management work, they inappropriately adopted methods such as deducting work points or suspending labor to treat the members. In cooperatives where these problems existed, the relationship between cadres and the masses was not close enough, and production work was affected to varying degrees.

How did these commandist work styles arise? The reasons are:

Grassroots cadres only had experience in managing individual economies, mutual aid groups, or primary cooperatives in the past. Now they must immediately manage large-scale advanced cooperatives with hundreds or thousands of households, a large number of people, and complex operations, which means they lack experience. In the past, they were also good at using a set of mass line working methods such as "individual connections" and "delivering services to the door" to solve problems. Now that the cooperatives have established a set of management institutions, which is originally necessary, it has also led to an increase in some top-down working methods such as "calling production team leader meetings" and "assigning tasks by area." They are no longer as deeply involved on the ground or in contact with the masses as they used to be. In addition, the cooperatives are in the early stages of establishment, and some members do not abide by labor discipline, do not pay attention to quality in their work, and do not cherish public property. Many complex new problems have indeed occurred in the work. Under these circumstances, cadres are not good at relying on the strength of the masses to overcome difficulties, not good at patiently educating and waiting for a few relatively backward members, and have developed impatience and a commandist work style. Some cadres have developed arrogance and complacency in the face of the victorious situation of agricultural socialist transformation. They believe that "after collectivization, we have the members' weaknesses in our hands, and things will be easy to handle in the future." They cannot see the enthusiasm of the masses to be masters of their own affairs, as if the members do not care about or want to ask about anything in the cooperative except for earning work points. They believe that as long as the cadres are doing good things for the masses, they do not need to consult with the masses too much. If they consult too much, "the people have a hundred different ideas," and it will be difficult to handle things. If things go wrong, "too many cooks spoil the broth." In this way, under the erroneous idea of so-called "thousands of people eat, one person manages the house," they often act arbitrarily and do not discuss problems properly with the masses, and commandism arises as a result. They originally wanted to do good things, but often ended up with bad results.

The commandist errors of grassroots cadres are also closely related to the subjective and bureaucratic work style of the leading organs. During this period, the party and government leading organs at all levels in Jiangsu Province once experienced a more serious tendency towards rash advance. For example, production plans were set too high, the reform of the farming system was demanded too urgently, and the promotion of double-wheeled double-share plows, the elimination of illiteracy, and the sale of certain overstocked commodities did not proceed from the actual needs and possibilities of the masses. The leading organs placed many tasks on the cooperatives and lacked specific guidance and assistance to the cadres; at the same time, political work was not sufficiently combined with economic work, and ideological education for cadres, especially education on implementing the mass line, was very insufficient, and the collectiveist education for the masses was also very insufficient. In this way, it largely directly promoted or indirectly contributed to the commandist errors of grassroots cadres. Some cadres said, "We know that commandism is not good, but the tasks are tight, the time is urgent, and there are few methods. When we get anxious, we can only be a little bit commanding."

Launching a Large-Scale Discussion on the Issue of "Democratic Operation of Cooperatives"

Not long ago, an incident occurred in the Gangzi Village Cooperative in Jurong County in which a poor peasant member, Zhou Dejin, committed suicide. Zhou Dejin was honest and active in production. Because the work points recorded for him by the cadres were unfair; after he was injured at work, the cadres did not assign him light work and did not provide money for him to seek medical treatment; and they groundlessly said that he was a "bad element" and "standing on the same line as the rich peasants." In this way, he committed suicide with grievances. This incident made us even more alert. We seized upon this matter, which had universal educational significance for grassroots cadres, and asked everyone to conduct a discussion on the issue of "democratic operation of cooperatives." Currently, this discussion is gradually unfolding in the grassroots party organizations and agricultural producer cooperatives throughout the province, and training courses organized by some county party committees are also using this issue as one of the teaching contents. The provincial party committee's newspaper, Xinhua Daily, has also opened up a special section to promote and guide this discussion.

In the discussion, we adhere to the policy of uniting, educating, and caring for grassroots cadres, adopt the educational method of the mass line, and do not want to "have everyone pass the test and everyone make a self-criticism," but rather organize everyone to freely discuss, enlighten everyone to start from their own personal experiences, and through criticism and self-criticism, affirm achievements, expose shortcomings, improve understanding, and improve work. For cadres who have made mistakes, as long as they recognize their mistakes and are determined to correct them, they are generally not punished. In the discussion, we guide grassroots cadres in various ways to improve their consciousness, strengthen their mass concept, and implement the mass line, so that they can more clearly understand that the tradition of our Party's mass line is to concentrate ideas from the masses in doing any work, and then persist in it among the masses. We must neither lag behind the level of consciousness of the masses, violate the principle of leading the masses to move forward, and therefore commit the error of tailism; nor can we exceed the level of consciousness of the masses, violate the principle of voluntary participation of the masses, and therefore commit the error of commandism. In leading the work of the cooperatives, it is not easy to learn how to manage this big family well; only by consulting with the masses on everything, giving full play to everyone's enthusiasm, and constantly carrying out education on "consolidating the collective and taking care of the individual" to the masses can we do a good job in the affairs of the cooperatives.

Educated Grassroots Cadres and Party and Government Leading Organs at All Levels

Through this discussion, all cooperatives that have done well have basically achieved happy cadres, satisfied masses, and vigorous production, and have seen more new atmospheres of democracy, unity, and active production. For example, cadres of the Gangzi Village Cooperative proposed to "meet with the members with five hearts," namely: treat the members with enthusiasm, persuade and educate them with patience, handle cooperative affairs carefully, be determined to overcome shortcomings, and serve the members wholeheartedly. The members reflected, "The cadres' voices have become softer, as if a new director has been changed." The members of the Tangcheng Township United First Cooperative put forward many suggestions for improving production and practicing economy, which were all adopted by the cadres, such as reducing the area of ​​drought-resistant grain by 300 mu and expanding the planting of rice, which can increase production by nearly 60,000 jin of grain, and adopting 14 manure accumulation methods, which can make 4,131 mu of rice generally fertilized once. The cooperative recently conducted an autumn distribution budget, and 96 percent of the members of the cooperative can increase their income. Facts have proved that this method of free discussion for education has significant results. Because this discussion helps to resolve the relationship between cadres and members, and between party members and the masses, it has moved the work of the cooperative forward. However, in cooperatives that are not doing well, the principles are not explained thoroughly, the methods are simpler, and some negative factors have also been produced. For example, some cadres misunderstood the discussion of "democratic operation of cooperatives" as "overthrowing the cadres" and felt that they had no prestige and things were difficult to handle; some members did not listen to the cadres anymore; and even in some cooperatives, a few former landlords and rich peasant elements took the opportunity to carry out provocative activities. Of course, this must also be paid attention to and corrected.

Through this discussion, on the one hand, the erroneous practice of "randomly labeling and arbitrarily deducting work points" by cadres was corrected, and on the other hand, members who did not abide by labor discipline were educated. This approach both overcame the commandist errors of cadres and did not frustrate the enthusiasm of cadres; it both promoted the enthusiasm of the masses to be masters of their own affairs, and educated the masses to love the cooperative as their own home, develop production, abide by labor discipline, and cherish the public property of the cooperative. On the basis of democracy and unity, some cooperatives have already begun to establish various democratic management systems such as collective leadership and member congresses and member representative congresses in accordance with the provisions of the model regulations of advanced agricultural producer cooperatives in our country, as an organizational guarantee for the implementation of democratic operation of cooperatives. Through this discussion, the grassroots party organizations in rural areas were rectified, the relationship between party members and the masses was further strengthened, the combat effectiveness of the party was strengthened, thereby further mobilizing the masses, and making progress in women's work and youth work.

Through this discussion, it also profoundly educated the leading organs and leading cadres at all levels in Jiangsu Province that they must adhere to and carry forward the tradition of the Party's mass line and overcome the subjective and bureaucratic work style of detaching themselves from the people and from real life in their leadership work. Only in this way can they help and influence grassroots cadres to change various erroneous ideological styles, help them learn to do their jobs well in a not too long time, run all the cooperatives well, and strive to fulfill the tasks stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) and build a new socialist countryside.

At this Eighth National Congress of the Party, the reports of Comrades Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping summarized the experience of our Party's mass line, which gave us great inspiration and education. We will resolutely and better implement this fundamental and long-tested line of the Party in all aspects of future work, so as to further unite the entire Party and the people of Jiangsu Province, give full play to all positive factors, and serve the great socialist construction cause of our country.

### 走群众路线才能办好农业生产合作社

    走群众路线才能办好农业生产合作社
    中共江苏省委员会第一书记　江渭清同志的发言
    我完全拥护毛泽东同志的开幕词、完全同意刘少奇同志、周恩来同志、邓小平同志代表党中央委员会在党的第八次全国代表大会上所作的报告。
    从党的第七次全国代表大会到现在的十一年间，我们彻底完成了伟大的资产阶级民主革命，又在基本上实现了伟大的无产阶级社会主义革命。这两次大革命的胜利，是全党正确地实行党的政治路线的结果，也是全党正确地实行党的群众路线的结果。毫无疑问，今后为了使党的事业取得新的、更大的胜利，必须在党中央和毛泽东同志的正确的领导下，不断地在党的工作中发扬群众路线的传统。
    我现在来谈谈“民主办社”的问题，也就是在农业生产合作社中实行党的群众路线的问题。
    现在，江苏全省加入农业生产合作社的农户，已经占总农户的百分之九十五点二八，其中参加高级合作社的农户占总农户的百分之七十七点七四。今年上半年，合作社经过了整顿之后，极大多数都已经巩固下来，生产力得到了新的发展。在今年夏收预分中，虽然小麦遭到暴雨，比原计划减产，还是有百分之七十五到百分之八十的社员增加了收入，其他百分之二十到百分之二十五的社员没有增加收入或者减少了收入。最近，我们正在尽一切的努力，搞好合作社的生产工作，争取秋季全面地、更多地增产，来弥补夏收的损失，使百分之九十以上的社员增加收入，其余的社员不减少收入，这样来巩固已经取得的胜利，并且在今冬明春彻底完成农业的社会主义改造任务。
    使合作社得以巩固的两个条件
    全省基本上实现农业合作化之后，随着所有制和农业经营方式的改变，农村工作进入了一个新的时期。在这种新的情况下，农村工作当前的主要任务，一方面是要从经济上帮助和领导合作社，在发展生产的基础上，正确地按照兼顾国家利益、集体利益和个人利益的分配政策，使百分之九十以上的社员都可以增加收入；另一方面又必须从政治上思想上教育基层干部依靠群众，学会当家，教育社员群众巩固集体、爱社如家。这两个方面是缺一不可的。缺少了任何一个方面，要使合作社真正得到巩固，是不可能的。我们认为：为了发挥广大的基层干部和社员群众的积极性，办好现有的合作社，胜利地完成今后的任务，“民主办社”是一个根本问题，也就是在农业合作社中坚持党的群众路线的问题。
    基层干部在党的领导和教育下，是懂得执行党的群众路线的。他们中间极大多数人出身于贫雇农，经历了相当长期的各种革命斗争的考验，与广大农民群众保持着密切的联系；他们成年累月风里来、雨里去，热心地为群众办事，取得了群众的信任和爱戴；他们在工作中，依靠了群众的智慧和力量，完成了党在每个时期的任务，也积累了相当丰富的工作经验，具有一定的政治水平。正由于这样，他们才能够在最近一年来带领全省三千多万劳动农民，那样迅速地、有秩序地把大批合作社组织起来，并且建立了合作社的生产秩序，展开了大规模的农业增产竞赛运动。今年夏季以来，连续遭受到暴雨、强台风的袭击，他们又与群众在一起，顽强地同自然灾害进行了胜利的斗争，使农作物减少了损失，虽然未能完成原定的夏收增产计划，但是比去年夏收的产量仍然略有增加。
    但是，在农村工作进入了一个新的时期以后，不少基层干部对这种新的情况认识不足，因此，在工作中发生了一些强迫命令的错误。他们在执行某些任务的时候，缺乏充分的政治思想工作，往往用行政命令的方法摊派任务。他们对有些社员提出的生产和生活上的困难问题，缺乏应有的重视和关怀。在领导工作中，当群众思想不通，不乐意接受他们的主张的时候，他们不是进行耐心的说服教育，反而给群众戴上什么“资本主义思想”“破坏集体主义”等帽子；有时在管理工作中，不适当地采取了扣工分、停止劳动等办法对待社员。存在这些问题的合作社，干部和社员群众的关系就不够密切了，生产工作也受到了不同程度的影响。
    强迫命令作风产生的原因
    这些强迫命令作风是怎样产生的呢？原因是：
    基层干部过去只有管理个体经济的、互助组的、或者初级社的经验，现在马上要管理成百户、成千户的规模庞大、人数众多、经营复杂的高级社，是缺少经验的。他们过去还善于用“个别串连”、“送上门去”等一套群众路线的工作方法去解决问题，现在合作社建立了一套管理机构，这本来是必要的，但是，因此也使“召开生产队长会议”、“划片交代任务”等一些由上而下的工作方法多起来了，他们就不像过去那样深入现场、接触群众了。加上合作社正处在初建时期，部分社员不遵守劳动纪律、干活不注意质量、不爱护公共财物，工作中确实发生了许多复杂的新问题，在这种情况下，干部不善于依靠群众的力量来克服困难，不善于耐心地教育和等待少数比较落后的社员，而产生了急躁情绪和强迫命令的作风。有些干部在农业社会主义改造的胜利形势面前，滋长了骄傲自满情绪，他们认为：“集体化了，社员的小辫子抓在我们手里，今后的事情好办了。”他们看不清社员群众要求当家作主的积极性，好像社员除了挣工分外，对社里的任何事情都不加关心、不要求过问似的。他们认为只要干部为群众办的是好事，可以不必多同群众商量，如果多商量了，“百姓百条心”，反而难办事情，弄得不好，“老大多了要翻船”。这样，他们在所谓
  “千人吃饭，一人当家”的错误思想下，因而有些问题就独断专行、不同群众好好地商量了，强迫命令也随之而产生了。他们原来一心想办好事，常常落得个坏结果。
    基层干部的强迫命令错误，又是与领导机关的主观主义、官僚主义的作风密切相关的。在这个时期内，江苏省的各级党、政领导机关，曾经一度发生过较为严重的急躁冒进偏向。例如：生产计划订得偏高，耕作制度改革要求过急，推广双轮双铧犁、扫除文盲、推销某些积压的商品等工作，不从群众的实际需要与可能出发。领导机关把许多任务压在合作社的头上，对干部又缺少具体的指导和帮助；同时，政治工作同经济工作结合得不够，对干部的思想教育，特别是执行群众路线的教育很不充分，对社员群众的集体主义教育也很不充分。这样，就在很大程度上直接地促成了或者间接地助长了基层干部强迫命令的错误。有些干部说：“我们知道强迫命令不好，但是任务紧，时间急，办法又少，心里一急，就只有带一点强迫了。”
    发起“民主办社”问题的大讨论
    不久以前，在句容县的岗子村合作社，发生了一个贫农社员周德金自杀的事件。周德金为人老实，生产积极。因为干部给他记的工分不公平；劳动负伤后干部不分配他轻活做，又不支钱给他治病；并且毫无根据地说他是“坏分子”、“同富农站在一条线上”。这样，他就含冤抱屈而自杀了。这一件事情使我们更加警觉起来。我们就抓住了这一件对基层干部具有普遍教育意义的事情，要求大家进行关于“民主办社”问题的讨论。现在，这个讨论正在全省党的农村基层组织和农业生产合作社中逐渐展开，部分县委举办的训练班，也以这个问题作为教学内容之一。省委的机关报——新华日报，也辟出了专门的篇幅来推动和指导这个讨论。
    在讨论中，我们对基层干部坚持团结、教育、爱护的方针，采取群众路线的教育方法，不是要“人人过关，个个检讨”，而是组织大家自由讨论，启发大家从自己亲身的体验出发，通过批评和自我批评，肯定成绩，揭露缺点，提高认识，改进工作。对有错误的干部，只要他们认识了错误，决心改正错误，一般的不加处分。在讨论中，我们多方诱导基层干部提高自觉性，加强群众观念，执行群众路线，使他们更清楚地认识到：我们党的群众路线的传统，就是做任何工作，都要从群众中集中起来，再到群众中坚持下去，既不能落后于群众的觉悟程度，违反领导群众前进一步的原则，因而犯尾巴主义的错误；也不能超过群众的觉悟程度，违反群众的自愿原则，因而犯命令主义的错误。在领导合作社的工作中，要学会当好这个大家是不容易的；只有遇事同群众商量，发挥大家的积极性，经常向群众进行“巩固集体、照顾个人”的教育，才能够把合作社的事情办好。
    教育了基层干部和各级党政领导机关
    通过这个讨论，凡是做得好的合作社，都基本上做到干部愉快，群众满意，生产起劲，出现了更多的民主、团结和积极生产的新气象。例如：岗子村合作社的干部提出同社员“五心相见”，即：热心对待社员、耐心说服教育、细心处理社务、决心克服缺点、全心全意为社员服务。社员反映：“干部的喉咙变细了，像换了一个新社长了。”唐城乡联合一社的社员提出了许多改进生产，厉行节约的建议，干部都采纳了，例如缩小三百亩旱谷扩种水稻，可增产近六万斤粮食，采用十四项积肥办法，可使四千一百三十一亩水稻普遍施肥一遍。这个社最近进行了秋季分配预算，全社百分之九十六的社员可以增加收入。事实证明，采取这种自由讨论的方法进行教育是有显著效果的。由于这个讨论有助于解决干部与社员、党员与群众的关系，因此，把合作社的工作向前推进了一步。但是，在做得不好的合作社，道理讲得不透彻，办法简单了一些，也产生了一些消极因素。如有的干部把“民主办社”的讨论，误解为“倒干”，感到没有威信了，事情不好办了；有些社员也不听干部的话了；甚至在有的合作社里，少数原来的地主、富农分子，乘机进行挑拨活动，当然，这也是必须注意纠正的。
    通过这个讨论，一方面改正了干部“乱戴帽子、滥扣工分”的错误做法，另一方面又对确实是不遵守劳动纪律的社员进行了教育。这样做，既克服了干部的强迫命令错误，又不挫折干部的积极性；既发扬了社员群众当家作主的积极性，又对社员群众进行了爱社如家，发展生产，遵守劳动纪律，爱护合作社的公共财物的教育。在民主、团结的基础上，有些合作社已经开始按照我国高级农业生产合作社示范章程的规定，建立了集体领导和社员大会、社员代表大会等各项民主管理制度，作为执行民主办社的组织保证。通过这个讨论，整顿了党的农村基层组织，使党员与群众的关系进一步密切了，党的战斗力加强了，从而又进一步发动了群众，并且使妇女工作和青年工作也有了进步。
    通过这个讨论，也深刻地教育了江苏省的各级领导机关和领导干部，必须坚持发扬党的群众路线的传统，克服领导工作中脱离人民群众、脱离实际生活的主观主义和官僚主义的作风。只有这样，才能够帮助和影响基层干部改变各种错误的思想作风，帮助他们在一个不太长的时间内，学会做好自己的工作，办好所有的合作社，为实现全国农业发展纲要（草案）所规定的任务，建设社会主义的新农村而奋斗。
    在这次党的第八次全国代表大会上，刘少奇同志和邓小平同志的报告中，总结了我们党的群众路线的经验，给了我们极大的启示和教育。我们一定坚决地把党的这一条根本的久经考验的路线，更好地贯彻到今后各方面的工作中去，从而进一步团结江苏全党和全省人民，发挥一切积极因素，为我国伟大的社会主义建设事业服务。
