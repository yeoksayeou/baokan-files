Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 8th - The broad cadres, staff, and workers in state administrative organs, organizations, and industrial and mining enterprises above the special district level in Hebei Province are actively donating winter clothing and cash to support farmers in disaster areas to overcome the famine.

After the launch of the winter clothing donation campaign in late August among the cadres, staff, and workers of organizations directly under Hebei Province, it has basically concluded by early September. According to incomplete statistics from forty units, 32,109 items of cotton quilts, mattresses, cotton-padded clothing, single-layer clothing, lined clothing, shoes, hats, and socks have been donated, along with 5,995 yuan in cash. Seventy-five employees of the Hebei Provincial Construction Bank donated 437 items of winter clothing in one day. During the donation, units such as the Hebei Provincial Hospital and the Hebei Provincial Public Security Bureau also cleared their inventories and donated some unused old quilts and cotton-padded clothing. Cadres, staff, workers, and their families in many organizations also organized sewing and washing groups, using their spare time to dismantle and wash the donated clothing, ensuring that shoes were paired, socks were matched, and clothes were clean, so that disaster victims could wear them as soon as they received them.

Party and trade union organizations in various cities also conducted education on the worker-peasant alliance among the workers, mobilizing them to conserve and donate. By August 29th, the city of Fengfeng had seen workers across the city donate more than 7,000 items of winter clothing and more than 1,600 yuan in cash to support disaster victims. Workers from units such as the Yaohua Glass Factory, the Power Plant, commercial and industrial departments, and educational institutions in Qinhuangdao City donated a total of 5,430 items of clothing.

    为灾民捐寒衣
    新华社保定8日电　河北省专区以上国家行政机关、团体、工矿企业的广大干部、职员、工人积极捐助寒衣和现款，支援灾区农民渡荒。
    河北省直属机关干部职工，从8月下旬开展捐献寒衣运动后，至9月初已基本结束。据四十个单位不完全统计，已捐出棉被、褥子、棉衣裤、单衣、夹衣、鞋帽袜等三万两千一百零九件，现款五千九百九十五元。河北省建设银行七十五名职工，一天之内就捐出四百三十七件寒衣。在捐助当中，河北省医院、河北省公安厅等单位还清理库存，捐出了一些用不着的旧被褥、棉衣裤等。很多机关的干部职工和家属还组织了缝洗组，利用休息时间拆洗捐献的衣物，作到鞋成对，袜成双，衣服干干净净，使灾民拿到手就可以穿。
    各城市的党和工会组织也向职工进行工农联盟的教育，发动职工节约捐助。峰峰市在8月29日止，全市职工支援灾民捐献的寒衣共七千多件，现款一千六百多元。秦皇岛市耀华玻璃厂、发电厂和工商业部门、教育机关等单位的职工共捐出五千四百三十件衣服。耀华玻璃厂在四天内就捐出了三百五十四件寒衣。张家口市各单位职工也都纷纷发起捐献。
