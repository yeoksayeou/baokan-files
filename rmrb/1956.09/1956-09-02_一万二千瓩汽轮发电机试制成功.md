Xinhua News Agency report: Workers at the state-owned Shanghai Electric Machinery Plant successfully trial-produced China's first 12,000-kilowatt steam turbine generator one month ahead of schedule.

This thermal power generator was trial-produced according to Soviet drawings. The actual processing time was only four months, even shorter than the time it took to trial-produce the 6,000-kilowatt generator the year before last. According to the test results conducted under Soviet national standards, all parts of this generator meet the standards. The rotor, which is five meters long and weighs more than nine tons, had a front and rear vibration of only two silk meters during the heat overspeed test with the coil heated to 130 degrees Celsius; the Soviet standard is no more than five silk meters.

While technicians and workers were conducting the final few test checks, Zhou Minghui, Deputy Director of Technology of the Steam Turbine Generator Workshop, spoke with reporters. He said that the 12,000-kilowatt steam turbine generator was not originally included in the first Five-Year Plan. Because we successfully manufactured the 6,000-kilowatt generator, it was included in the plan this year. At the beginning of the year, the employees originally planned to complete the trial production before the end of September and dedicate it to National Day. Before the plant's Party member congress in early June, the workshop's Party branch secretary and responsible Party cadres inspected the production preparation work for the 12,000-kilowatt generator and studied the possibility of completing the 12,000-kilowatt generator ahead of schedule. At the branch meeting held in the workshop, the branch secretary proposed completing the trial production task one month earlier. After the Party members discussed the new processing schedule in detail, they believed it could be achieved. Therefore, the Steam Turbine Workshop Branch Congress made a resolution and put forward this proposal at the plant-wide Party member congress.

All relevant departments and workshops throughout the plant responded enthusiastically to their proposal. Yang Lingen, the model worker who finely machined the rotor, and two other eighth-grade lathe operators used a double-knife turning method to complete the work of 160 quota hours in 100 hours. Yin Xinggen, the old technician who completed the rotor finishing as scheduled, solemnly escorted the electric crane hoisting the rotor to the assembly section and demanded that they also complete the winding work as scheduled. The employees earnestly carried out various trial production tasks according to the new schedule. There was no rework of any parts during the processing, and all of them were completed on time and with quality.

Zhou Minghui said that in the trial production process, the Party organization of the workshop played a role in collective leadership. All possible technical problems were pre-organized by technicians and experienced workers to conduct process analysis and absorb advanced experience from all aspects to determine the most reliable processing methods. In the final period of construction, the Party organization also organized six professional groups to study in advance based on thirteen important production key points, and was responsible for mastering them during the construction process. Therefore, not only was the quality of the generator guaranteed, but also the tight construction schedule was achieved.

### 一万二千瓩汽轮发电机试制成功

    一万二千瓩汽轮发电机试制成功
    据新华社讯　国营上海电机厂职工提前一个月把我国第一台一万二千瓩汽轮发电机试制成功。
    这台火力发电机是按照苏联的图纸试制的，实际加工时间只有四个月，比前年试制六千瓩发电机的时间还短。按照苏联的国家标准进行试车检查的结果，这部发电机的各部分都符合标准。长达五公尺、重九吨多的转子，在线圈加热到摄氏一百三十度进行热超速试验的时候，前后震动只有二公丝；苏联标准是不超过五公丝。
    当技术人员和工人们正在进行最后几项试车检查的时候，汽轮发电机车间技术副主任周明辉与记者进行了谈话。他说，一万二千瓩汽轮发电机原来没有列入第一个五年计划，因为我们成功的造出了六千瓩发电机，今年就列入了计划。在年初时候，职工们原定把它提前在9月底试制完成，献给国庆节。6月初，本厂召开党员大会之前，车间的党支部书记和党员负责干部检查了一万二千瓩发电机的生产准备工作，研究了提前完成一万二千瓩发电机的可能性。在车间召开的支部大会上，支部书记提议再提前一个月完成发电机的试制任务。党员们详细讨论了新的加工进度表以后，认为可以实现。于是汽轮机车间支部大会作出了决议，在全厂党员大会上提出了这个倡议。
    全厂有关科室和车间都热烈地响应了他们的倡议。精车转子的劳动模范杨林根和另两个八级车工用双刀车削的方法，定额一百六十小时的工作在一百小时内完成了。如期完成了转子精加工的老技师殷兴根郑重的护送吊着转子的电动起重车走到装配工段，要求他们同样能如期完成嵌线工作。职工们认真地按照新的进度表进行各项试制工作，各种零件在加工过程中没有返工现象，都能按期按质的完成。
    周明辉说，在试制过程中，车间的党组织发挥了集体领导的作用，所有可能发生的技术问题，都预先组织技术人员、老师傅进行工艺分析和吸收各方面的先进经验，确定最可靠的加工方法。在施工的最后时期，党组织还根据十三个重要的生产关键，组织了六个专业小组事先研究，并在施工过程中负责掌握。因此不但保证了发电机的质量，而且实现了紧迫的施工进度。
