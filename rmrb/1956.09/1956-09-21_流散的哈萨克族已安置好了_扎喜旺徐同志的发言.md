    The Kazakhs Who Fled Have Been Properly Resettled
    Comrade Zha Xi Wang Xu's Speech

    Before liberation, some Kazakhs originally residing in Xinjiang, unable to bear the oppression and massacres by Kuomintang's Sheng Shicai, fled to the border areas of Gansu, Qinghai, and Xinjiang provinces. They had to live a nomadic life for a long time and were forced to rely on robbery to survive. In the years after liberation, we did a lot of work to win them over and unite with them, and finally enabled them to settle down and helped them establish autonomous organs. Now, together with the Mongolian and Tibetan people, they are contributing their strength to the development of the Qaidam Basin.

    I fully support the three reports made by Comrades Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, and Deng Xiaoping on behalf of the Central Committee and am determined to strive to realize the various resolutions to be adopted at this conference.

    Qinghai is a multi-ethnic region. In the seven years since liberation, due to our firm implementation of the Party's policies of ethnic equality and unity, the establishment of ethnic regional autonomy in areas inhabited by ethnic minorities, and the realization of the rights of all ethnic groups to be masters of their own affairs, the unity between and within ethnic groups has been strengthened, agricultural and pastoral production has developed, and the lives of all ethnic groups have improved. Now I will only talk about the issues of winning over, uniting, and resettling the scattered Kazakh tribes in Qinghai.

    Like other ethnic groups, the Kazakhs are a diligent and courageous people who originally lived in Xinjiang. Starting in 1935, some of them fled to the border areas of Gansu, Qinghai, and Xinjiang provinces, one after another, because they could not bear the oppression and massacres of the Kuomintang's Sheng Shicai. During their migration, they helped the old and the young and suffered greatly from the pursuit and blockade of Sheng Shicai's army. After arriving in the border areas of Gansu, Qinghai, and Xinjiang, they were repeatedly encircled and suppressed by Ma Bufang's troops, forcing them to run around without a place to settle, and almost all of them were wiped out. In total, about 40,000 people from Kazakh tribes fled to the border areas of the three provinces, but only 2,400 remained by the time of liberation in 1949. Some of the rest returned to Xinjiang, some drifted abroad via Tibet, and most died under the knives of the Kuomintang reactionaries. Their fate was extremely tragic. In order to survive, these Kazakh tribes had to remain nomadic for a long time and were forced to rely on robbery to maintain a minimum standard of living, which made their relationship with the local Mongolian, Tibetan, and other ethnic groups very bad. Under the instigation and propaganda of the Kuomintang reactionaries, the local people regarded them as "bandits."

    In the early days of liberation, because they did not understand the policies of our Party and the People's Government, coupled with the instigation of counter-revolutionary elements, they continued to live a nomadic and robbery life, and once engaged in armed confrontation with the People's Government, which caused extreme chaos in the local social order and seriously affected the production and life of the local people of all ethnic groups.

    From 1950 onwards, we carried out many efforts to win over these Kazakhs. However, because they had many doubts and concerns, fearing that the government would pursue their past, eliminate religion, and fear retaliation from the local people, it was not easy to win them over for a while. At the same time, some comrades within our Party lacked a comprehensive historical understanding of the problem of the scattered Kazakhs and mistakenly regarded them as "bandits," believing that the problem could not be solved without fighting, which hindered the smooth progress of the winning-over work.

    In the summer of 1952, under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee, the erroneous thinking on the Kazakh issue existing within the Party was strictly criticized, and a comprehensive effort to win over, unite, and resettle the scattered Kazakh tribes was launched. The Party basically adopted two methods to deal with the problem of the scattered Kazakhs. One was to win them over and unite them politically, and the other was to properly resettle them in terms of life and production. First, Kazakh upper-class people and cadres of their own nationality who had contact with the scattered Kazakhs were dispatched to publicize the policies, eliminate doubts, and bring materials to help them solve their immediate livelihood difficulties. Then, in the spring of 1953, a joint meeting of Kazakh headmen and a unity conference of all ethnic groups in the border areas of Gansu, Qinghai, and Xinjiang provinces was held in Lanzhou, inviting representatives from the local Kazakhs, Mongolians, Tibetans, and other ethnic groups to participate and jointly discuss the issue of resettling the scattered Kazakh tribes. After twelve days of repeated consultation, an agreement was reached on the resettlement of the Kazakhs, determining that Haizi in Dunhuang, Gansu, and Garmu in Dulan, Qinghai, two areas with abundant water and grass, would be used as grazing grounds for the Kazakhs' livestock, and a batch of funds would be allocated to help them purchase production and living materials such as cattle, sheep, and tents. From clothing to food, the government adopted a temporary package policy (for a period of two years). At the same time, it was decided to help them establish autonomous organs so that they could manage their own internal affairs; and to help them establish primary schools to develop culture and education. This initially stabilized the long-scattered Kazakh tribes. However, their doubts and concerns were not completely eliminated, and they also lacked understanding of the various construction undertakings in the motherland. Therefore, after the joint meeting, the then Northwest Administrative Committee specially organized a delegation to express condolences. Then, their representatives were organized to visit the capital of the motherland and other places. At the same time, a Party working committee was established in the area where they lived and grazed to specifically lead and help them build their homes and businesses. After more than three years of efforts, this part of the long-scattered Kazakhs has finally settled down and is living a free and happy life. Now, the Kazakh tribes residing in Qinghai have increased in population from the original 900 people to 1,017 people, their livestock has grown from more than 10,000 heads to more than 28,000 heads, and they have established agricultural production cooperatives and pastoral production mutual aid groups, as well as primary schools, shops, and medical and health institutions. They have also trained some cadres of their own nationality in their work. All these facts have deeply moved the Kazakh people, inspired their patriotic enthusiasm and socialist initiative, and have also strengthened the relationship between the Kazakhs and other ethnic groups, stabilized the social order in the border areas of the three provinces, and created favorable conditions for various tasks in the area. The local Mongolian, Tibetan, and other ethnic groups are very satisfied with this solution to the Kazakh problem, and it has also prompted them to further lean towards the Party and the government. In recent years, the Kazakh people in these areas have united with the Mongolian, Tibetan, and other ethnic groups to actively support the transportation to Tibet and the development of the Qaidam Basin, making many beneficial contributions. More than 40 people who were conducting surveys in the Qaidam Basin were trapped in the deep mountains and heavy snow due to getting lost. They were rescued by the local Kazakh, Mongolian, and Tibetan people and escaped from danger. Now, these Kazakh people are united with other ethnic groups, under the leadership of the Party, and are striving with full confidence to further build their new life and support the socialist construction of the motherland. An old Kazakh man said: "I have lived for eighty-five years and have gone through the Qing Dynasty, the Kuomintang, and the three eras led by Chairman Mao. Only now are the days better. I used to think about dying, but now I not only don't want to die, but I want to live a few more years." These words reflect the general sentiment of the Kazakh people.

    From the fact of winning over, uniting, and resettling the scattered Kazakh tribes, we deeply realize the greatness and correctness of the Party's policies of ethnic equality and unity. The Kazakhs have historically been an oppressed nation, and for many years they have suffered from national oppression. The reason why the scattered Kazakh tribes engaged in robbery was also caused by long-term national oppression. The problem of the scattered Kazakhs is a national problem, not a "bandit" problem. If they are treated as bandits and fought against, it will not only fail to solve the problem, but will increase ethnic estrangement and arouse their resolute resistance. At the same time, the lives of the scattered Kazakh people are extremely poor. If their livelihood and production problems are not properly solved, it will be impossible to completely stabilize them and to consolidate their unity. The Party, based on this situation, adhered to the policies of winning over, uniting, and resettling them, and the facts have proved that it is completely correct.

    Now, the problem of resettling the scattered Kazakhs has been satisfactorily resolved, but the experiences and lessons learned from solving this problem are still worth paying attention to and absorbing in our future work.

    The issue of ethnic minorities in our country is a very important issue in the entire national life. We must adopt a more serious, active, and enthusiastic attitude towards all ethnic minorities, and provide as much help as possible to all ethnic minorities, overcoming any small manifestation of Han chauvinism. Then we will be able to unite all ethnic groups in the country more closely, more easily overcome local nationalism among ethnic minorities, and thus fully mobilize the positive factors of all ethnic groups in the country to carry out the socialist construction of our country.

    流散的哈萨克族已安置好了
    扎喜旺徐同志的发言
    解放前，原住新疆的一部分哈萨克族人，不堪国民党盛世才的压迫屠杀，先后逃往甘、青、新三省边界地区。他们不得不长期流动，被迫靠抢劫来维持生活。解放后这几年，我们对他们做了许多争取和团结的工作，终于使他们定居下来，并且帮助他们成立自治机关。现在，他们和蒙古族、藏族人民一起正把自己的力量贡献给开发柴达木盆地的事业。
    我完全拥护刘少奇同志、周恩来同志和邓小平同志代表中央委员会所作的三个报告，并决心为实现这次大会即将通过的各项决议而奋斗。
    青海是一个多民族地区，解放后七年来，由于我们坚决贯彻执行了党的民族平等、团结政策，在各少数民族聚居地区建立了民族区域自治，实现了各族人民当家作主的权利，因而增强了民族间与民族内部的团结，发展了农、牧业生产，改善了各族人民的生活。现在我只讲一下关于争取、团结和安置在青海的哈萨克族流散部落问题。
    哈萨克族和其他各族人民一样，是一个勤劳勇敢的民族，原来居住在新疆，因为不堪忍受国民党盛世才的压迫屠杀，一部分人从一九三五年开始，先后陆续逃往甘肃、青海和新疆三省的边境地区。他们在移动途中扶老携幼，曾受到盛世才军队的追剿、堵击，牺牲很大。到达甘、青、新边境地区后，又遭到马步芳部队的多次围剿，迫使他们东奔西跑，没有安身之地，几乎全部被消灭。总计哈萨克族部落先后逃到三省边境地区的约四万人，到一九四九年解放时只剩了二、四○○余人。其余一部分人返回新疆，有些人经过西藏流落国外，绝大部分的人则死于国民党反动派的屠刀之下，命运是十分悲惨的。这些哈萨克族部落为了生存下去，不得不长期流动，被迫靠抢劫来维持最低限度的生活，致使他们与当地蒙古族、藏族等各族人民的关系十分恶劣。在国民党反动派的挑拨宣传之下，当地各族群众都把他们当做“土匪”。
    解放初期，由于他们对我党和人民政府的政策不了解，加上反革命分子的挑拨煽动，仍然继续过着流动抢劫的生活，并曾经与人民政府一度武装对抗，致使当地社会秩序极端混乱，严重地影响了当地各族人民的生产和生活。
    从一九五○年起我们即对这部分哈萨克人进行了多次的争取工作。但由于他们的怀疑顾虑很多，怕政府追究既往、怕消灭宗教、怕当地各族人民报复，一时不容易争取过来；同时在我们党内也有一些同志对于流散的哈萨克族的问题，缺乏历史的全面的了解，错误地把他们当做“土匪”，认为不打不能解决问题，妨碍了争取工作的顺利进行。
    一九五二年夏在党中央的正确领导下，严格地批判了党内存在的对哈萨克族问题的错误思想，全面展开了对哈萨克族流散部落的争取团结和安置工作。党对流散的哈萨克族问题的处理，基本上采取了两条办法。一条是从政治上争取和团结他们；一条是在生活和生产上妥善地安置他们。首先派遣和流散的哈萨克族有联系的哈萨克族上层人士和本民族干部前往宣传政策，消除疑虑，并且携带了物资，帮助他们解决眼前的生活困难。接着又于一九五三年春天在兰州召开了甘、青、新三省边境地区哈萨克族头人联谊会及各族团结会议，邀请当地哈萨克族和蒙古族、藏族等各族代表人士参加，共同协商安置哈萨克族流散部落的问题。经过十二天的反复协商，达成了安置哈萨克族的协议，确定分别以甘肃敦煌的海子和青海都兰的噶尔穆两个水草丰美的地区为哈萨克族的牲畜放牧场所，并且拨出一批款项帮助他们购买牛、羊、帐房等生产资料和生活资料，从穿衣到吃饭，政府都采取暂时包下来的政策（为期两年）。同时，并确定帮助他们建立自治机关，让他们自己管理自己内部的事务；帮助他们建立小学，发展文化教育。这样就使长期流散的哈萨克族部落初步安定了下来。但是他们的怀疑顾虑仍然没有最后消除，对祖国内地各项建设事业也缺乏了解。于是在联谊会后，当时的西北行政委员会又特地组织了慰问团前往慰问。接着又组织他们的代表人士出来到祖国首都和其他各地参观。同时，又在他们居住放牧的地区，成立了党的工委，具体领导和帮助他们建家立业。经过三年多的努力，这一部分长期流散的哈萨克人，已经最后安定下来，过着自由幸福的生活。现在居住在青海的哈萨克族部落，人口由原来的九百人增加到一千零十七人，牲畜由一万余头发展到二万八千多头，并且办起了农业生产合作社和牧业生产互助组，建立了小学校、商店和医疗卫生机构，也在工作中培养了一些本民族的干部。所有这些事实，都使哈萨克族人民非常感动，激发了他们的爱国主义热情和社会主义积极性，并且密切了哈萨克族和其他各民族之间的关系，安定了三省边境地区的社会秩序，给当地的各项工作创造了有利条件。当地蒙古族、藏族等各族人民对这样解决哈萨克族问题，都很满意，并且促使他们也进一步靠拢了党和政府。几年来，这些地区的哈萨克族人民和蒙古族、藏族等各族人民一起积极支援西藏运输和柴达木盆地的开发工作，做了许多有益的贡献。曾经有四十多名在柴达木盆地进行勘察的人员，因为迷失方向被困在深山大雪中，冻饿交加，经过当地哈萨克族、蒙古族、藏族各族人民的营救才得脱险。现在这些哈萨克族人民正和其他各族人民团结一致，在党的领导下，满怀信心地为进一步建设自己的新生活和支援祖国的社会主义建设而努力。一个哈萨克族老人说：“我活了八十五岁了，经过了清朝、国民党和毛主席领导的三个时代，只有现在的日子才好过了。过去我常想死，现在不但不想死，还要多活几年。”这些话反映了哈萨克族人民的普遍心情。
    从争取、团结和安置哈萨克族流散部落的这一事实中，我们深深地体会到党的民族平等、团结政策的伟大和正确。哈萨克族在历史上是一个受压迫的民族，多年来它吃尽了民族压迫的苦头。哈萨克族流散部落之所以进行抢劫，也是长期的民族压迫所造成的。流散的哈萨克族的问题是一个民族问题，绝不是“土匪”问题。如果当作土匪去打他们，不仅不能解决问题，反而会增加民族隔阂，激起他们的坚决反抗。同时，流散的哈萨克族人民的生活极端贫苦，如果不妥善地解决他们的生活和生产问题，就不可能使他们完全安定下来，也就不可能巩固地团结他们。党根据这种情况，对他们坚持了争取、团结和安置的政策，事实证明是完全正确的。
    现在，安置流散的哈萨克族的问题是圆满地解决了，但解决这一问题的经验教训还是值得我们在今后工作中继续注意吸取的。
    我们国内的少数民族问题，是整个国家生活中一个十分重要的问题。我们要采取更加认真的、积极的和热情的态度去对待各少数民族，尽可能地给各少数民族以帮助，克服大汉族主义的任何一种细小的表现，那我们就能够使国内各兄弟民族更加亲密地团结起来，更容易克服少数民族中的地方民族主义情绪，因而就能够充分调动国内一切民族的积极因素来进行我国的社会主义建设。
