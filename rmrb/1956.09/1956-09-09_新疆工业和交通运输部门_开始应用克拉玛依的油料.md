Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, 8th. Reporter Yi Xiao reports: Gasoline, diesel, and other fuels refined from crude oil produced in Karamay by the Dushanzi Refinery of the Xinjiang Petroleum Administration have begun to be used in industry and transportation in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region.

The Dushanzi Refinery test-refined 200 tons of Karamay crude oil in April of this year. Based on the characteristics of Karamay crude oil, they formulated new operating procedures. From June onwards, the plant successively began large-scale refining in the distillation, cracking, coking, and asphalt workshops.

Workers of all ethnic groups at the Dushanzi Refinery refined the Karamay crude oil with extreme excitement. In the past, due to insufficient crude oil supply, some of the refinery's equipment had been idle. The coking workshop and asphalt workshop, after their completion last year, had been unable to conduct regular production for a long time until the Karamay crude oil arrived. Now, due to the supply of Karamay crude oil, the distillation workshop has already begun to feel that its equipment capacity is insufficient, the cracking workshop operated more days in August than in any previous month, and the coking workshop and asphalt workshop have also formally commenced production. In order to refine Karamay crude oil, the Dushanzi Refinery workers overhauled all the equipment and launched a socialist competition. In the process of formulating and implementing new operating procedures, the workers also put forward many rationalization proposals.

The output of crude oil from Karamay during trial oil production and trial runs will continue to increase as the scale of exploration expands. Therefore, the Dushanzi Refinery is also preparing to expand.

    新疆工业和交通运输部门
    开始应用克拉玛依的油料
    新华社乌鲁木齐8日电　新华社记者伊晓报道：新疆石油管理局独山子炼油厂用克拉玛依所产原油炼制成的汽油、柴油等，已经在新疆维吾尔自治区的工业和交通运输上应用。
    独山子炼油厂曾经在今年4月份试炼了二百吨克拉玛依原油。他们根据克拉玛依原油的特点，制定了新的操作规程。从6月份起，这个厂就陆续在蒸溜、裂化、焦化和沥青等车间开始了大量炼制。
    独山子炼油厂的各族工人以极其兴奋的心情炼制克拉玛依的原油。过去，这个炼油厂由于原油供应不足，部分设备曾经闲置起来。焦化车间和沥青车间从去年建成以后，直到克拉玛依原油运来之前，长期不能进行正规生产。现在，由于克拉玛依原油的供应，蒸溜车间已经开始感到设备能力不足，裂化车间在8月份进行生产的天数比过去任何一个月都多，焦化车间和沥青车间也正式投入生产了。独山子炼油厂职工为了炼制克拉玛依的原油，检修了全部设备，并且展开了社会主义竞赛。在制定和执行新操作规程当中，职工们还提出了许多合理化建议。
    克拉玛依在试油和试车中所产的原油，随着勘探规模的扩大，产量还将不断增加，因此，独山子炼油厂还准备扩建。
