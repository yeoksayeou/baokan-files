Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, September 4th. Chongqing city's relevant departments are taking measures to clear goods backlogged at harbors, docks, and stations.

    The Jiulongpo Wharf, located on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River in Chongqing, allows ships to dock directly and has mechanized loading and unloading equipment and wharf warehouses available. However, in the past, because its location was not ideal, it was only used for loading and unloading heavy items, and it was often idle. Since August, the Chongqing Port Authority has been transporting some non-heavy goods here for loading and unloading, which can reduce the need for the currently insufficient pontoons and barges. Chongqing Iron and Steel Company is the largest cargo owner of the transportation department and has its own loading and unloading capabilities within the factory. The Chongqing Port Authority borrowed large tugboats from the Yangtze River Shipping Department to tow barges to the Iron and Steel Company's wharf, where they loaded and unloaded themselves, reducing the workload at the port.

    The Chongqing Transportation Company also organized a group of social laborers, including residents' production teams, porters' family members, and suburban farmers, to participate in the work of transporting goods. In the second quarter of this year, they completed the equivalent of 44.5% of the tasks completed by the transportation company's workers. This company also organized vehicles owned by government agencies and enterprises to participate in urban transportation. Two thousand farmers from the Fuling Special Zone have been participating in the transportation work since August, and some vehicles have also begun night transportation.

    Currently, the Jiulongpo Wharf in Chongqing is being rebuilt and additional equipment is being added. After the completion of this wharf, it will become a large wharf capable of unloading one-fifth of imported goods. The Caiyuanba Wharf near the Chongqing Railway Station, which has two thousand porters, will also set up two thousand meters of light rails after the river recedes to reduce the need for manpower.

    The Chongqing Municipal Transportation Units Joint Office has decided to organize forces from September onwards to verify the consignment plans of various units, organize the balance and coordination of various transportation capacities, to further eliminate the current backlog of materials.

    Chongqing is the largest water and land transportation hub in the Southwest. Since the beginning of this year, the volume of water and land freight has increased month by month and quarter by quarter, but the equipment and manpower for handling and loading and unloading have not only not increased accordingly, but have actually decreased. Taking Yangtze River transportation as an example, the transportation volume of export goods in the first quarter of this year increased by 56.2% compared with the same period last year, and the second quarter increased by 41.95% compared with the first quarter. The planned transportation volume in the third quarter is 16.1% more than the actual completion volume in the second quarter. The growth of imported goods on the Yangtze River is even greater, with the transportation volume in March of this year being twice that of the same period last year, and the volume in July of this year increasing by 30% compared with March. The increase in urban transportation is even greater. The reason is that new characteristics have emerged in Yangtze River shipping and railway transportation this year. Not only has the export of goods from the Yangtze River increased, but the import of goods from the Yangtze River has increased even faster; not only has the upward flow of goods on the railway increased, but the downward flow of goods to Chongqing has increased even more sharply. The previous situation where harbors, docks, and stations could only load but not unload, only enter but not exit, has changed. This has created a new situation in which urban transportation must both enter and exit, and harbors and stations must both load and unload. However, the loading and unloading capacity of the harbors actually decreased by 13.78% at the beginning of the year. Under these circumstances, Chongqing experienced a tense situation of goods being backlogged at docks and stations for the first time. The berthing time of ships in Chongqing Port has increased from about ten hours in the past to seventeen hours now due to untimely loading and unloading. During the continuous rainy days in mid-August, the Chongqing Railway Station experienced congestion where trains could not enter the station due to excessive accumulation of goods at the station. Furthermore, the rush to transport more goods has made the loading, unloading, and handling forces feel even more insufficient.

### 重庆市调动一切运输力量  清除积压在港湾码头和车站的物资

    重庆市调动一切运输力量
    清除积压在港湾码头和车站的物资
    新华社重庆4日电　重庆市各有关部门，正在采取措施清除积压在港湾、码头、车站的物资。
    位于重庆市长江上游的九龙坡码头，船舶可以直接靠岸，有机械化起卸设备和码头仓库可以利用。但是过去因为地位不够适中，仅仅用来起卸重件，空闲的时候很多。从8月份起，重庆港务局将一部分不是重件的物资运到这里起卸，这样可以减少目前深感不足的趸船和驳船的需要量。重庆钢铁公司是运输部门最大的货主，厂内本身有装卸力量。重庆港务局便向长江航运部门借来大拖轮，把驳船拖到钢铁公司的码头，由他们自行装卸，减轻在港装卸的工作量。
    重庆市的运输公司也组织一批社会劳动力，包括居民生产组、搬运工人家属和郊区农民，参加搬运物资的工作。今年第二季度，他们完成了相当于搬运公司工人完成的44.5％的任务。这个公司还组织了机关、企业的自备车辆参加市内运输。来自涪陵专区的二千农民，从8月份起陆续参加搬运工作，部分汽车也已开始夜间运输。
    目前，重庆市的九龙坡码头正在进行改建和增添设备。这个码头建成后，将成为能起卸五分之一进口货物的大码头。拥有二千搬运工人的重庆火车站附近的菜园坝码头，等江水退落后也将设置二千公尺的轻便铁轨，以减少人力的需要。
    重庆市运输单位联合办公室，决定从9月份起，组织力量核实各单位的托运计划，组织各种运力的平衡和衔接工作，以进一步消除目前物资积压的现象。
    重庆市是西南最大的水陆联运枢纽。今年以来，水、陆货运量逐月逐季增加，但是搬运、装卸的设备和力量不仅没有相应增加，反而有所减少。以长江运输为例，出口物资今年第一季度的运输量比去年同期增长56.2％，第二季度又比第一季度增加41.95％，第三季度的计划运输量比第二季度实际完成量还要多16.1％。长江进口物资增长更大，今年3月的运量为去年同期的二倍，今年7月又比3月份增加了30％。市内运输增长的幅度更大。原因是今年长江航运和铁路运输都出现新的特点。不但长江出口物资增加了，长江进口物资增加更快；不但铁路上行物资增加，下行到重庆的物资增加更猛。以往港湾、码头、车站可以只装不卸，只进不出的情况已发生变化。这就形成了市内搬运必须既进又出，港湾、车站必须既装又卸的新局面。但是港湾的装卸力量，在年初反而减少了13.78％。在这种情况下，重庆市第一次出现了物资积压在码头、车站的紧张情况。重庆港轮船留港时间因为装卸不及时，已经由过去的十小时左右增加到现在的十七小时。重庆火车站在8月中旬阴雨连绵的日子，因车站物资积存过多，更出现了列车不能进站的堵塞现象。再加以突击抢运多，装卸、搬运的力量更感到不足。
