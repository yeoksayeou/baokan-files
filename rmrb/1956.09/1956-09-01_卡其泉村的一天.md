    A Day in Kachi Spring Village
    Zhang Pei
    One morning in late May, we set off for Kachice Village, about fifty kilometers west of Prague. It probably rained last night, and the air was particularly fresh. The car passed through clusters of cherry and apple blossoms, and then entered the shade of linden trees. Traveling on the flat roads of Czechoslovakia was already a pleasure, especially in this late spring of May.
    In less than an hour, the car stopped in front of the office of the "New Life" Agricultural Production Cooperative in Kachice Village. Mr. Stafávek, the tall deputy chairman of the cooperative, wearing long rubber boots, came out to greet us. We entered a very large room with a long table in the middle, probably a place for meetings. Next to it were two desks, and a typewriter was ticking away. A brown-haired girl of about twenty was working intently, and I guessed she might be the cooperative's accountant.
    We sat down, and Comrade Stafávek began to introduce the general situation of the cooperative. He first described that the cooperative was formed in 1953 by merging three small cooperatives. These three small cooperatives were established successively in 1951 and 1952. At that time, they only had eighty hectares of land. Now, the three production teams of the cooperative have a total of one thousand hectares of land, fifty-six farm households (family members of workers who participate in the cooperative are not included in the farm households), and one hundred and eighty-five laborers, two-thirds of whom are women. The first production team of Kachice Village is the largest, with 517 hectares of land, and 90% of the farmers in the village have joined the cooperative.
    Stafávek then brought a pile of various forms, explaining that the cooperative's production is also planned. These forms contain detailed schedules for planting and harvesting, fertilizer application plans, plans for applying new farming methods to certain lands, etc. Then he mentioned that the cooperative has 690 head of cattle, of which 300 are dairy cows and the rest are beef cattle; more than 700 pigs, and more than 10,000 chickens and ducks, including 2,500 laying hens. Last year, the entire cooperative made a total of 100,000 workdays, and each workday earned 26 crowns in cash, plus one kilogram of barley, one kilogram of wheat, half a kilogram of oats, and two kilograms of potatoes, totaling about 30 crowns. Male laborers can do 500 to 600 workdays a year, earning 15,000 to 18,000 crowns, equivalent to the income of a mid-level skilled worker.
    This was our first visit to an agricultural cooperative in Czechoslovakia, and we were very happy to hear that the cooperative had so much land, livestock, and poultry, and that the income of the members was quite substantial. However, some things were not entirely clear in my mind at once. For example, how could more than one hundred laborers manage so much land and livestock? Why are two-thirds of the cooperative members women? Kachice Village has nearly a thousand people, but the cooperative only has fifty-six households in total. Why is it said that 90% of the farmers have joined the cooperative?
      "Now, please come and see our cooperative!" Stafávek stood up and said. We left the office and walked along the village street. Like other villages in Czechoslovakia, the street had small shops, two-story houses with beautiful curtains and flower pots in the windows, and children playing on the street with small bicycles. Probably this was the first time Chinese people had come to the village, and men and women all ran out to see us and greet us.
    Comrade Stafávek first led us to see the electric incubator of the poultry group (which has fourteen people). The machine was very new, and could hatch 10,000 chicks at a time. The cooperative often had tens of thousands of chicks and ducklings for sale successively. A middle-aged woman in charge of the electric incubator enthusiastically explained the process of electric incubation to us.
    From the electric incubator, we had to walk a distance to see the cooperative's greenhouse. On the way, we passed the cooperative's dairy farm, and several trucks were loading milk. Taking advantage of the walk, I chatted with Stafávek again, wanting to get answers to some of the questions I had from the conversation in the office. After his explanation, I understood that a considerable part of the cooperative's 1,000 hectares of land was used to grow feed for livestock, because from the cooperative's income perspective, livestock and poultry were the main source (later, when we talked with the Ministry of Agriculture, we learned specifically that livestock accounted for almost half of the cooperative's income, while crops only accounted for one-third). It took less labor to manage feed than to grow grain. At the same time, the village's agricultural machinery station had thirteen tractors, and there were many other combine harvesters and new square planters for planting potatoes, so there was very little manual labor in the fields, and the labor force was generally sufficient. Kachice Village is close to the Kladno coal mining area, so many of the village's thousand people were miners and other service personnel, as well as teachers, etc., and there were not many farmers. Later, we encountered this situation in other places as well: rural residents were not all farmers, and some villages were mainly industrial workers rather than farmers. Why were two-thirds of the laborers women? This was because some of the miners' family members also participated in the cooperative's production.
    Then we spent two hours visiting the cooperative's greenhouse, chicken coops, and places where calves lived. Part of the greenhouse was used to grow vegetables in winter, and part was used to grow flowers. All Czechoslovakian families love flowers and grow flowers, and it wouldn't do for a cooperative not to have a flower room. The old man in charge of the flower room, with his gray hair, was especially happy to see us and gave each of us a bouquet of large white flowers, which he said were transplanted from India. It turned out that his nephew was a technician who was currently helping us with construction in China, so he was particularly affectionate when he saw Chinese people. The chicken coops were set up on a hillside, in a long row of neat little houses. Stafávek said that the place was windy and a bit cold, and they were planning to move the chickens. The most interesting thing was the place where the calves lived. There were probably dozens of calves that had just been born gathered together, and each calf had its own beautiful name. Stafávek said that this was a new Soviet method of raising calves, and the effect was very good. The method was to separate the calf from its mother a few days after it was born, feed it milk and feed, and let it live alone, so that it would grow quickly, gaining a kilogram of meat every day.
    It was almost one o'clock in the afternoon. We were originally scheduled to have lunch at the cooperative's office, but Comrade Stan, who was accompanying us from the "Red Rights Newspaper," suddenly thought that time was precious, so why not take the opportunity to visit a member's family during lunch? We certainly agreed with this suggestion.
    So we temporarily broke into the home of a farmer whose husband was a driver for the cooperative and whose wife was a feeder for the cooperative.
    The husband was out working, and only the wife, Grachinova, was at home. She settled us in the guest room upstairs, which had a bedroom and a room for the three children. The style of the house was, as we call it, a Western-style house, painted very beautifully. The equipment in the room was also very good, with linoleum on the floor. Against the wall on the right was a sofa that could be used as a bed, a large shortwave radio, and on the left was a new-style electric stove with three electric burners. Seeing that the host lived in such a good house, we asked about her living situation. She said that the lives of cooperative members were similar to hers. Last year, she and her husband together had a labor income of 36,000 crowns. They couldn't spend all the money, so they ordered a car. In addition, seventeen other farmers also pre-ordered cars. Because there were too many people buying cars, it was almost always necessary to pre-order the year before. As we were talking, her fourteen-year-old and twelve-year-old daughters returned from school one after another, quietly sitting beside us listening to us talk.
    While eating lunch, I thought to myself, this is a very good agricultural cooperative, but how was it run so well? What difficulties are there now? I raised my thoughts and asked Stafávek if he could talk to me about this. He immediately agreed, but said that he originally had a meeting at two o'clock and now had to go back and tell the others that he wouldn't be attending. This made me very embarrassed, so I immediately said to him: "I can't delay your meeting, let's reschedule!" Stafávek replied very frankly: "If I went to China for a visit and encountered such a situation, I think you would also sacrifice the meeting to talk to me, right?"
      Ten minutes later, Stafávek returned, and we
  began our second conversation. The hostess, Grachinova, poured each of us a glass of wine, and Stafávek answered my questions calmly, as before:
      "It's really not easy to run a cooperative well. In the beginning, not many people believed in the benefits of the cooperative. Plus, the former rich peasants, mill owners, and landlords secretly spread bad influences, which was very difficult at the time. You know that some farmers here had already used machines to cultivate the land before the war, so tractors alone could not attract farmers to join the cooperative. In addition, some people are religious, and they only believe that God will give them happiness, and they don't believe in the cooperative.
      "In the beginning, only a few advanced elements in the village took the lead, promoting the benefits of cooperative large-scale production, promoting that more labor would definitely lead to more rewards, and also promoting the bright future of cooperativization. So more and more people joined, with forty people and eighty hectares of land. This was in 1951. But it was really difficult to get the farmers to eliminate the boundaries of the land from their minds, plus we ourselves made the mistake of being too hasty and forced some farmers, which resulted in the stagnation of the cooperative's development. Later, the Party corrected this mistake, making the Party members realize that they could only adopt the method of persuasion and education towards the farmers. By 1953, the cooperative had developed greatly, because the farmers had personally seen the benefits of the cooperative: individual farmers could only harvest an average of sixty kilograms of beef per hectare per year, while the cooperative could harvest an average of one hundred and thirty kilograms of beef per hectare per year. Because the cooperative's economy had been rising, and the members' income had increased, everyone was convinced.
    "The country's help has a lot to do with the success of our cooperative. The state lent us two million crowns as production funds, which were repaid in installments with very low interest. In addition, the state machinery station helped us use machines to cultivate the land, which was much cheaper than using horses ourselves. Plowing one hectare of land only cost twenty-three crowns, and we didn't have to pay cash, only agricultural products or livestock products, such as eggs, which were calculated at market prices, so it was very beneficial to the members. In addition, the workers helped us a lot, doing voluntary labor for us and giving us agricultural tools.
      "Of course, the most important thing is the leadership of the Communist Party. It was the Party that pointed out the great future of cooperativization. When we encountered difficulties, it was the Party that came up with various ways to help us solve them. Now each production team is divided into several operation areas, and each operation area has a Party propagandist, who is also the Party's group leader. The cooperative has a total of eighty Party members.
      "Although the cooperative has developed well now, and the members can buy cars one after another, we can't say that every farmer has thoroughly recognized the bright path of the cooperative. Not long ago, two farmers asked to withdraw from the cooperative. We followed their wishes and didn't make it difficult for them at all, letting them take another look outside the cooperative. It always takes a process to educate a person!"
    Talking about this, I felt that Stafávek was a comrade who understood the Party's policies and was very capable of analyzing problems. Finally, Comrade Stafávek also talked about China. He said: "I have liked geography and history since I was a child. I know that the Chinese people used to be very bitter. When you drove Chiang Kai-shek away, we were extremely happy. I know that your current construction and technology are developing very quickly. You have gone through bloody struggles, and every machine you add makes people feel powerful. Your country is so big, and its resources are so abundant, so the future development is really amazing."
    Comrade Stafávek ended his conversation with these heartfelt and friendly words, and raised his glass to toast our friendly meeting.
    It was already past four o'clock. We originally wanted to visit the cooperative's kindergarten, but it was too late. After expressing our sincere gratitude to Comrade Stafávek, we said goodbye to Kachice Village and the "New Life" Agricultural Cooperative and embarked on our journey home.
    In the car, I thought that China and Czechoslovakia have many different situations, but the ideal of socialism is common. Although various conservative, backward, and reactionary factors often come to hinder us, the people will ultimately take the bright path of socialism. The example of Stafávek and the "New Life" Agricultural Cooperative tells us that it is not far off to strive for the decisive advantage of socialist components in Czechoslovakian agriculture.

    卡其泉村的一天
    张沛
    五月末的一个早晨，我们出发到布拉格西边五十多公里的卡其采村去。大概昨晚落了一阵雨，空气特别新鲜，车子在樱桃树和苹果树的花丛中穿过，又进入菩提树的林荫中，在捷克斯洛伐克的平坦公路上旅行已经是一件快事，何况又在这晚春的五月。
    不到一个小时，车子在卡其采村“新生活”农业生产合作社的办公处门口停下来。身材高大穿着长筒胶靴的合作社副主席斯塔伐克出来接待我们。我们进了一间很宽大的屋子，中间放着一张长桌，大概是开会的地方，旁边放着两张办公桌，打字机滴答滴答的响着，一个二十岁左右棕色头发的姑娘正在紧张地工作着，我猜想她也许是合作社的会计员。
    我们坐下来，斯塔伐克同志开始介绍这个合作社的一般情况。他首先叙述了合作社是1953年把三个小合作社合并成立的，这三个小社是1951、52年先后办起的，当时只有八十公顷土地，现在变为合作社的三个生产队，共有一千公顷的土地，五十六个农户（工人家属参加合作社的，不列入农户里面），一百八十五个劳动力，其中三分之二是妇女。卡其采村的第一生产队是最大的，拥有五百一十七公顷土地，本村90％的农民都已参加合作社。
    斯塔伐克接着抱来一堆各种各样的表格，说明合作社的生产也是按计划办事的。这些表里有详细的种植与收割的时间表、施肥的计划表、在哪些土地上运用新耕作方法的计划表等等。接着他又讲到合作社有六百九十头牛，其中三百头是奶牛，其余是肉食牛；七百多头猪，一万多只鸡、鸭，其中有二千五百只下蛋的母鸡。去年全社一共作了十万个劳动日，每个劳动日得现金二十六个克朗，另外有一公斤大麦、一公斤小麦、半公斤燕麦、两公斤土豆，总共约合三十个克朗。男劳动力每年可作五百到六百个工作日，可得一万五千到一万八千个克朗。相当于一个中等技术工人的收入。
    我们是第一次在捷克斯洛伐克访问农业合作社，很高兴听他讲到合作社有这样多的土地、牲畜和家禽，而社员们的收入是相当丰富的。可是对有些情况，在我脑子里一下子还不完全清楚，比如，一百多个劳动力怎样伺弄得了这么多的土地和牲畜？为什么合作社社员中三分之二是妇女？卡其采村有将近一千人口，而合作社总共只有五十六户，为什么说90％的农民都已参加合作社？
      “现在请你们去看看我们的合作社！”斯塔伐克站了起来说。我们出了办公处，沿着村子的街道走了一截路，像捷克斯洛伐克的其它村子一样，街道两旁有小商店，有挂着漂亮窗帘、窗口放着花盆的二层楼的住宅，孩子们在街上骑着小自行车玩耍。大概这个村子第一次有中国人来，男男女女都跑出来看我们，向我们问好。
    斯塔伐克同志首先领我们去看家禽组
  （有十四个人）的电孵场，机器很新式，每次可以孵出一万个小鸡，合作社经常拥有几万只小鸡小鸭陆续出售。管理这个电孵场的一个中年妇女热情地给我们讲了电孵的过程。
    从电孵场出来，要走一段路去看合作社的暖房，路上经过合作社的牛奶场，几辆载重汽车正在装运牛奶。乘着走路的空闲，我又和斯塔伐克攀谈起来，我是想把刚才在办公处谈话中的一些问题求得解答。经过了他的说明，我才明白了，原来这个合作社的一千公顷的土地，有相当大的一部分是种牲畜的饲料，因为从合作社的收入来看，牲畜、家禽是主要的（以后我们在农业部谈话时，具体了解了牲畜几乎占合作社收入的一半，而农作物只占三分之一），饲料的伺弄比种粮食要省工些，同时本村的农业机器站有十三部拖拉机，其它联合收割机、种土豆的新式方形播种机等还有很多，田间的人工劳动已经很少，所以劳动力一般是够用的。卡其采村靠近克拉得诺煤矿区，因此村子里的一千人口中，很多是矿工和其它服务性的人口以及教师等等，农民反而不多。以后我们在其它地方也遇到这种情形，乡村居民并不都是农民，甚至有的村子主要不是农民而是产业工人。为什么三分之二的劳动力是妇女？这是因为有一些矿工的家属也参加了合作社的生产。
    接着我们用了两个小时的时间，参观了合作社暖房、鸡舍、小牛住的地方。暖房一部分是冬天种蔬菜用的，一部分是种花的，这里种着各种各样的花。捷克斯洛伐克人家家户户都爱花、养花，合作社没有个花房是不行的。管理花房的是一个头发花白的老头，见了我们特别高兴，给我们每人送了一把据说是印度移植过来的大白花。原来他的侄子是一个技术人员，现在正在中国帮助我们建设，所以见了中国人特别亲热。鸡舍是设在靠山坡的地方，是一长列整齐的小房子。斯塔伐克说，这地方风大有些冷，还准备给鸡搬家呢。最有意思是小牛住的地方，大概总有几十条刚刚生下不久的小牛集中在一起，每条牛都有自己漂亮的名字。斯塔伐克说，这是苏联养小牛的新方法，效果很好。办法是小牛生下以后几天，就让它和母亲分别，喂给牛奶、饲料，单独生活，这样长得快，每天能长一公斤的肉。
    已经快到下午一点钟了。本来安排我们在合作社办公处吃午饭，陪我们的“红色权利报”的斯丹让同志忽然想起时间很宝贵，为什么不乘吃饭的时间，去拜访一个社员的家庭呢？这个提议我们当然非常赞同。
    于是我们临时闯进了一个丈夫是合作社的运输员、妻子是合作社的饲养员的农民家庭。
    丈夫外出工作了，只有妻子格拉奇诺娃在家。她把我们安置在楼上的客房里，里面有一间是卧房，还有一间是三个小孩住的。房子的样式按照我们的叫法是西式洋房，粉刷得很漂亮。房间里的设备也很好，地板上还铺着漆布，靠右首的墙壁放着一张可以当床睡的沙发、一只很大的短波收音机，左边有个装着三只电炉的新式电灶。看了主人住着这样好的房子，我们就问起她的生活情况。她说合作社社员的生活都和她差不多。去年她和她丈夫一起，劳动收入有三万六千克朗，钱花不完，所以现在订购了一辆汽车。另外有十七户农民，也预订了汽车。因为买汽车的人太多，所以差不多总要在前一年预订。正在说话时，她的十四岁和十二岁的两个女儿先后放学回来了，很安静地坐在旁边听我们讲话。
    在吃午饭的时候，我独自想着，这是一个很好的农业合作社，可是它是怎样办好的？现在还有些什么困难？我把我的想法提出来，问斯塔伐克能不能给我谈谈这方面的情况。他马上答应了，不过他说他本来在两点钟要开一个会，现在要回去通知另外的人说他不参加了。这使我很不好意思，于是马上对他说：“不能耽误你们开会，我们改期再谈吧！”斯塔伐克很爽直地回答：“如果我到中国去访问，遇到这样的情况，我想你一定也会牺牲开会来和我谈话的吧？”
      过了十分钟，斯塔伐克回来了，我们
  开始了第二次的谈话。女主人格拉奇诺娃给我们每人面前倒了一杯葡萄酒，斯塔伐克像前次一样不慌不忙地来回答我的问题：
      “办好一个合作社，真不是一件很容易的事。在开始的时候可真没有多少人相信合作社的好处，加上过去的富农、磨坊主、地主在暗中散布坏影响，当时是很困难的。你知道在我们这儿有些农民在战前就已经用机器种地，所以光是拖拉机还不能吸引农民来参加合作社。加上有些人信教，他们只相信上帝会给他们幸福，而不相信合作社。
      “开始时村子里只有几个先进分子打先锋，宣传合作社大生产的好处，宣传劳动得多报酬一定多，还宣传合作化的美好远景。于是参加的人慢慢地多了，有了四十个人、八十公顷土地。这是在1951年。但是要农民从思想上把地界取消，真是一件难事，加上我们自己犯了急性病，对农民有些强迫，结果合作社的发展反而停滞了。以后党纠正了这个错误，使党员们认识到对农民只能采取说服教育的办法。到1953年合作社大大发展了，因为农民亲眼看到了合作社的好处：个体农民平均每公顷土地每年只能收获六十公斤牛肉，而合作社每公顷土地平均每年能收获一百三十公斤牛肉。因为合作社的经济一直上升，社员的收入增加了，大家才信服了。
    “我们的合作社能办好，国家的帮助有很大的关系。国家贷给我们二百万克朗，作为生产资金，分期还清，利息很低。另外，国家机器站帮助我们用机器种地，比我们自己用马种地便宜得多，犁一公顷地只要二十三个克朗，不给现钱，只给农产品或者畜产品，比如给鸡蛋，又是按照市场价格计算，所以对社员很有利。此外，工人对我们的帮助很大，为我们进行义务劳动，送给我们农具。
      “当然，最重要的还是共产党的领导，是党指出合作化的远大前途，在我们遇到困难的时候，是党想各种办法来帮助我们解决。现在每个生产队分成几个作业区，每个作业区有一个党的宣传员，同时也是党的小组长。合作社一共有八十个党员。
      “虽然现在合作社已经发展得不错了，社员们能纷纷买汽车了，但是还不能说每一个农民都彻底认识了合作社这条光明大道。不久以前，有两户农民要求退社，我们按照他们的自愿，一点没有留难，让他们在社外再看一看。教育一个人总得有个过程呢！”
    谈到这里，我感觉斯塔伐克是一个懂得党的政策很能分析问题的同志。最后，斯塔伐克同志还谈到了中国。他说：“我从小就喜欢地理和历史，我知道中国人民过去非常苦。当你们把蒋介石赶跑时，我们高兴极了。我知道你们现在的建设和技术发展得很快，你们经过血的斗争，你们每增加一部机器都使人感到力量。你们的国家那样大，资源那样丰富，将来发展的前途真不得了。”
    斯塔伐克同志用这些衷心的友好的话语，结束了自己的谈话，并举起酒杯来，为我们这次友好的会见干杯。
    已经四点多钟了，本来还想去参观合作社的幼儿园，已经来不及，我们向斯塔伐克同志恳切地道谢以后就告别了卡其采村和“新生活”农业合作社，踏上了归途。
    在汽车里，我想着，中国和捷克斯洛伐克存在着很多不同的情况，但是社会主义的理想是共同的，尽管有各种保守的、落后的、反动的因素常常来妨碍我们，但是人民最终还是要走社会主义这条光明大道。斯塔伐克和“新生活”农业合作社的例子告诉我们，争取社会主义成份在捷克斯洛伐克农业中达到决定性的优势，已经不是很远的事了。
