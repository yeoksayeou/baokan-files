    National Table Tennis Tournament Anecdotes
     Father and Son
    Wang Chuanyao, who came from Beijing to Wuhan to participate in the National Table Tennis Championships, met his forty-eight-year-old father, veteran table tennis player Wang Huizhang, at the Wuhan Gymnasium. Wang Huizhang works at the Shanghai Post Office and was invited here to serve as a referee.
    Wang Huizhang, who started practicing table tennis at the age of nineteen, often practiced with Wang Chuanyao when Wang Chuanyao was young. Wang Huizhang first taught his son to practice defense and master the technique of chopping the ball, and then taught Wang Chuanyao to learn to attack. After Liberation, Wang Chuanyao's table tennis skills improved rapidly. When Wang Chuanyao defeated Jiang Yongning this time, Wang Huizhang said that Jiang Yongning had many things worth learning from for Wang Chuanyao.
      A Newly Married Couple
    The two famous table tennis players Sun Meiying and Jiang Yongning were only married on July 7th of this year. During the competition, this newly married couple cared for each other very much. On the evening of the 7th, after Jiang Yongning was defeated by Wang Chuanyao, Sun Meiying pointed out his shortcomings in this match to Jiang Yongning. Jiang Yongning was not discouraged by his failure at all, and Sun Meiying was also very happy to see him like this. Sun Meiying said: "If you can't beat others, you should humbly learn from them."
    Jiang Yongning is good at defense, while Sun Meiying is good at attack. Sun Meiying said: "When I play, I just want to defeat my opponent, while Jiang Yongning only wants to wait for his opponent to make mistakes. We both go to extremes and should reconcile a bit."
     "Who wants to play a few rounds with me?"
    There is a strong coach in the Beijing team named Fu Qifang. In last year's National Table Tennis Championships, he came in second only to Jiang Yongning. This time he was unable to participate in the competition due to illness. However, the enthusiastic and intense competition made the famous table tennis player unable to calm down. When he saw others practicing, he often asked others: "Who wants to play a few rounds with me?"
    Fu Qifang's enthusiasm for playing touched the doctor's heart. The doctor supervising him sometimes made an exception to let him play a few rounds, but he was only allowed to move his hands, not his feet, and could only play for five minutes.

    全国乒乓球比赛花絮
     父子俩
    从北京来武汉参加全国乒乓球锦标赛的王传耀，同他四十八岁的父亲、乒乓球老将王惠章在武汉体育馆会面了。王惠章在上海邮局工作，是应邀来这里担任裁判的。
    从十九岁就开始练习打乒乓球的王惠章，在王传耀小的时候就经常同王传耀在一起练习打乒乓球。王惠章先教儿子练守球和掌握削球的技术，然后才教王传耀学攻球。解放以后，王传耀的乒乓球技术提高得很快。当王传耀这次击败姜永宁以后，王惠章说姜永宁有许多值得王传耀学习的地方。
      一对新婚夫妇
    两个著名的乒乓球选手孙梅英和姜永宁是今年7月7日才结婚的。在比赛中，这一对新婚夫妇彼此都很关心。7日晚上，当姜永宁被王传耀打败后，孙梅英就向姜永宁指出他在这场比赛中的缺点。姜永宁对于自己的失败丝毫没有气馁，孙梅英见他这样也很高兴。孙梅英说：“打不过别人就要虚心向别人学习。”
    姜永宁善于防守，而孙梅英擅长攻击。孙梅英说：“我打球只想击败对手，姜永宁只想等对手自己失误，各走极端，应该调和一下。”
     “谁来跟我打两下”
    北京队有一名身材健壮的指导，名叫傅其芳。在去年全国乒乓球冠军赛中，他仅次于姜永宁得到第二名。这次他因为患病没能参加比赛。但是，热烈紧张的比赛使这个著名乒乓球运动员的心情无法平静下来。他在看别人练球时，常向别人请求说：“谁来跟我打两下”。
    傅其芳要求打球的热情，打动了医生的心。监督他的医生有时破例地让他打两下，但是，只许手动，不许脚动，而且只能打五分钟。
