Xinhua News Agency, Karamay, 12th - The Karamay Mining Bureau has recently taken measures to strengthen the oil testing and trial production of petroleum exploration wells in order to prepare data for the future development and design of the oil field here.

Since the completion of the first exploration well in late October last year, the Karamay Oilfield has completed a total of twenty-six exploration wells to date. After the completion of these exploration wells, oil testing work was carried out separately, and individual wells were also put into trial production. In the process of oil testing and trial production, in addition to training some skilled workers, certain data were obtained from each well. However, due to the incomplete oil testing and trial production equipment and the weak technical force, these tasks were not carried out formally and systematically enough, and the quality of the data obtained was not good enough. In particular, it is far from meeting the needs for the development and design of a large-scale oil field.

Recently, the Karamay Mining Bureau has formulated some specific measures to strengthen oil testing and trial production. In terms of oil testing, they first analyzed the situation of the existing twenty-six exploration wells in detail, and combined with the requirements of geological work, selected twelve representative exploration wells and divided them into two groups for oil testing. In terms of trial production, some representative exploration wells were also selected for work, and based on the existing data and problems existing in the work, relevant systems for oil nozzle use, gas measurement, pressure gauge inspection, oil measurement, and oil well management were formulated. The geological and engineering departments of the Mining Bureau have also appointed special personnel to be responsible for organizing and leading the oil testing and trial production work.

    克拉玛依矿务局加强试油和试采工作
    新华社克拉玛依12日电克拉玛依矿务局最近采取措施加强石油探井的试油和试采工作，为将来开发设计这里的油田准备资料。
    克拉玛依油田，从去年十月底钻完第一口探井以来，截至目前为止已经钻完二十六口探井。这些探井在钻完以后，都分别进行了试油工作，个别井还进行了试采工作。在试油和试采过程中，除培养了一些技术工人外，从每一口井里都取得了一定的资料。但是，由于试油、试采的设备不齐全，技术力量过于薄弱，这些工作进行的不够正规和系统，已取得的资料质量都不够好，尤其对开发设计一个大规模油田来说，还远远不能满足需要。
    最近，克拉玛依矿务局制定了一些加强试油、试采工作的具体措施。在试油方面，他们首先对现有的二十六口探井的情况进行具体分析，并且结合地质工作的要求，选择了十二口有代表性的探井，分成两组进行试油。在试采方面，也选择了一些有代表性的探井进行工作，并且根据已有的资料和工作中存在的问题，制定出有关油咀使用、气体测量、压力表检查、量油和油井管理等制度。矿务局的地质和工程部门，还指定专人负责组织领导试油和试采工作。
