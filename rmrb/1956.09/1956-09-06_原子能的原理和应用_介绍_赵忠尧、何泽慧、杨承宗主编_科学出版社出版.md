Introduction to "Principles and Applications of Atomic Energy"
Zhao Zhongyao, He Zehui, Yang Chengzong (Editors) Science Press.

    Recently, articles about atomic energy and tracer atoms have frequently appeared in newspapers and magazines, and there are also many popular booklets. Not long ago, the Soviet Exhibition of Science and Technology for Peaceful Use of Atomic Energy was held in Beijing. These are all new phenomena after the emergence of a new era in science.

    "Principles and Applications of Atomic Energy" is also a popular science book, but it has a significant difference compared to some similar books and short articles in newspapers and magazines. It introduces knowledge about atomic energy more systematically, completely, and specifically. I bought this book after visiting the Soviet Exhibition of Science and Technology for Peaceful Use of Atomic Energy in Beijing. I watched some of the exhibits in the Soviet exhibition hall two or three times, and I also listened to the guides, but because the utilization of atomic energy involves many aspects of science and technology, I couldn't immediately understand some of the issues. After reading this book, I felt that it played the role of an excellent guide, helping me solve many problems.

    The first part of this book introduces the principles of atomic energy; from the structure of matter to atoms, atomic nuclei, and nuclear reactions, followed by an introduction to the instruments and equipment used in studying nuclear reactions and utilizing atomic energy. Without this knowledge, the use of atomic energy is impossible. The next part introduces the applications of atomic energy in power, radioactive isotopes in industry, physics, chemistry, geology, agricultural science, medicine, and biochemistry, etc. The utilization of atomic energy is very broad, so the introduction in the book is also multifaceted. The entire book has 234 pages, with each part taking up half of the content.

    In terms of writing methods, the entire book is divided into ten chapters and one hundred and one sections, which can be said to be quite detailed; at the same time, the editors are very serious and responsible when defining and explaining a concept. These factors make this book somewhat like a textbook. System, completeness, rigor, and faithfulness to science are its advantages; however, monotonous and unlively narration and some inflexible expressions are its shortcomings. Nevertheless, I feel that this does not diminish the scientific value of this book, but rather limits its readership. The editors say in the preface that the target audience of this book is readers with a high school education. This can only be said to be a requirement for readers, but not everyone with a high school education likes to read it. If this book is compared with Ilyin's "What Is It?", then it is much inferior. Ilyin's book is written interestingly, it attracts people with stories, so it can inspire readers to love science. However, "Principles and Applications of Atomic Energy" is less effective in this regard. It mainly imparts new scientific knowledge and occasionally cites some popular examples. This book attracts people with new knowledge. Unlike textbooks, it achieves colloquialization, adopts scientific conclusions, and explains and illustrates them without the formulas, calculations, and experimental techniques found in textbooks. The entire book is strung together by raising questions, answering questions, and explaining problems.

    The illustrations in the book are as clear as the explanations in the text, and some schematic diagrams are very suitable for teaching. For example, the alpha particle scattering experiment diagram, the Rutherford nuclear reaction experiment diagram, the cloud chamber schematic diagram, and the schematic diagrams of the structure of atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs are all very inspiring and make the profound science of atomic energy easy to accept. This can also be said to be a great advantage of this book. Due to the above advantages, this book can be used as reference material for chemistry and physics teachers when lecturing, making lectures more accessible and easier for students to accept. For students, this book is equivalent to an in-depth and easy-to-understand lecture by a teacher. For some technical personnel, it is like a crash course book, providing everyone with general knowledge of atomic energy utilization, so that everyone has a preliminary preparation and full enthusiasm to welcome the many upcoming technological reforms.

    “原子能的原理和应用”介绍
    赵忠尧、何泽慧、杨承宗主编　科学出版社出版
    乐秀毓
    近来报刊上关于原子能和标记原子的文字常有所见，通俗的小册子也不少，不久以前在北京苏联展览馆又举行了苏联和平利用原子能科学技术展览会。这些都是科学上出现了一个新时代后的新气象。
      “原子能的原理和应用”也是一本通俗的科学著作，但是它同某些同类书籍和报刊上的短篇文字比较起来，有一个显著的不同。它较系统地、完整地、具体地介绍了有关原子能的知识。我在参观了苏联和平利用原子能科学技术展览会后买了这本书。在苏联展览馆内有些展出部分我看了两三遍，也听了说明员介绍，但是，由于原子能的利用涉及到多方面的科学技术，有些问题我还无法一下领会。读了这本书以后，我感到它起了一个优秀的说明员的作用，帮我解决了不少问题。
    这本书第一部分介绍原子能的原理；从物质结构说到原子、原子核、核反应，接着介绍研究核反应以及利用原子能时所用的仪器和设备等。没有这些知识，利用原子能是不可能的。下一部分介绍原子能在动力方面，放射性同位素在工业、物理、化学、地质学、农业科学、医学和生物化学等等方面的应用。原子能的利用是很广泛的，因此，书中所作的介绍也是多方面的。全书计二百三十四页，上下部的内容各占一半。
    在编写方法上，全书分成十章一百零一节，可说是分得相当细致的；同时，编者在下定义和说明一个概念时，也是很认真负责的，这些因素使得这本书有些像教科书。系统、完整、严密、忠于科学是它的优点；但是叙述单调、不生动、表达方式有些不灵活，却是它的缺陷。虽然如此，我觉得这并没有降低这本书的科学价值，只是限制了它的读者群。编者在序言中说，这本书的对象是具有高中文化程度的读者。这只能说是对读者的一种要求，但是有高中文化程度的不一定爱读。如果把这本书同伊林的“十万个为什么？”等相比，那么它就要逊色多了。伊林的书写得有趣，它用故事吸引人，所以它能激发读者爱科学。但是“原子能的原理和应用”在这方面的作用是较差的。它主要的是传授新的科学知识，偶而举些通俗的例子。这本书是以新的知识吸引人的，同教科书不同的是它做到了口语化，对有些问题只是采用了科学上的结论，加以解释和说明，没有教科书中列公式、演算、实验技术等的那一套。全书是以提出问题、解答问题、说明问题等等方式贯穿起来的。
    书中的插图同本文的说明一样清晰，有些示意图很适宜用于教学。例如甲种粒子的散射实验图、卢瑟福核反应实验图、云雾室示意图、原子弹和氢弹构造的示意图等，都很能启发人想像，使高深的关于原子能的科学变得容易接受。这也可说是这本书的一个很大优点。由于上述种种优点，所以这本书可作为化学和物理教师讲课时的参考材料，使讲课更通俗更容易被学生接受。对学生说来，这本书相当于教师深入浅出的一个讲座。对某些技术人员说来，它像是一本速成书，提供大家利用原子能的一般知识，使大家有一个初步准备和充分的热情来迎接即将到来的许多技术改革。
