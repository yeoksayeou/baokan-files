    No More of This "Fatherly Style"
    Wang Kelang
    I have four children. The oldest is seventeen this year and is in his third year of high school. In recent years, due to work, I haven't been home often and rarely pay attention to my children's lives and studies; "I can't manage my children's education." I often feel distressed.
    Recently, I returned home and saw that my eldest child had a straight chest. I was very happy and asked him:
    "Your body is very good. How did you train?"
    "Swimming."
    "When did you learn?"
    "I started learning in fifth grade of elementary school."
    "Fifth grade?" I was almost shocked. He was only ten years old then. "You rascal, learning to swim at such a young age without telling your father!"
    The child smiled: "If I told you, I'm afraid you wouldn't let me go swimming for the rest of my life."
    The child is right, no, he is simply protesting against my outdated "fatherly style." For more than ten years, I thought I was loving and caring for my children. I wanted to guard them all day long, tying them to my belt, watching them eat, sleep, dress, and walk. When they played with mud and sand, I said they were getting their hands and feet dirty; when they went out to jump and run, I worried that they would break their knees; almost none of the things they spontaneously and proudly did could make me nod happily without interference. As a result, some of them became timid, trembling at the sight of an ant; some lied, afraid to tell the truth when they made mistakes; some became withdrawn, like little old men when they saw strangers. Only this eldest child, only on the matter of learning to swim, did he find a loophole and wasn't controlled. His body was surprisingly trained to have a straight chest. From the child's personal experience, how could he not protest?
    My incorrect "fatherly style" is certainly not a good example. However, the problem doesn't stop there.
    My child also said that in school, some teachers probably have a "fatherly style" similar to mine, from the classroom to the playground, from formal learning to day-and-a-half field trips, they follow the students like shepherds herding ducks, even on two- or three-day holidays, various collective activities are arranged densely, without a minute of free time...
    I can understand this, it's out of good intentions to care for the students, fearing that if they blink, the students will run wild like runaway horses. But what is the effect? My child said it well:
    "Teachers always think the tighter they control, the better. But we are not clay Buddhas, of course we can't stand it. Sometimes it even makes the teachers frown and worry, why bother! Once, our whole school set off on a suburban trip in separate classes, each class had a teacher taking care of them, but in our class, the teacher happened to be sick and couldn't take care of us. Hehe, we handled everything very well ourselves, and the school even praised us when we returned."
    Of course, we cannot conclude from this, "Okay, let the children do whatever they want, fathers and teachers should turn a deaf ear and close their eyes."
    No, my child doesn't mean that. What he is protesting against is just that my "fatherly style" and that of some teachers similar to me are undesirable, reminding those with this incorrect "style" not to cultivate the younger generation into clay Buddhas.

### 不要这样的“爸爸作风”

    不要这样的“爸爸作风”
    王克浪
    我有四个孩子。大的今年十七岁，现在高中三年级读书。近几年，我因工作关系，不常在家，对孩子们的生活、学习，很少过问；“对孩子们的教育没法管了。”我常感到苦恼。
    最近，我回到家里，看到大孩子的胸脯笔挺，我很高兴，便问他：
    “你的身体很不错了，怎么锻炼的？”
    “游泳。”
    “几时学会的？”
    “在小学五年级，就开始学了。”
    “五年级？”我几乎吓一跳，那时他才十岁零一点哩。“顽皮鬼，那么小的年纪学游泳，也不告诉爸爸啊。”
    孩子笑笑：“要是告诉你，只怕一辈子也不会让我去游泳。”
    孩子说的没错，不，简直是在抗议我的背时“爸爸作风”。十多年来，我自以为是爱孩子，关心孩子，他们吃饭、睡觉、穿衣、走路，我恨不得成天守护着，把他们绑在裤腰带上。他们玩玩泥沙，我说弄脏手脚；他们出去蹦蹦跳跳，我担心他们跌破膝头；凡是他们自动自发自以为得意的玩意儿，几乎没有一椿可以叫我不加干预地欣然点头。于是他们有的胆怯了，踩着只蚂蚁就打抖；有的说谎了，真正犯了错误不敢讲；有的孤僻起来了，见了生人就像个小老头。只有这个大孩子，只在学游泳这一件事上，给他钻了空子，没管着，他的身体竟然锻炼得胸脯笔挺。从孩子的切身体会说，怎能叫他不提抗议呢。
    我的不正确的“爸爸作风”当然不足为训。然而问题还不止此。
    也是我的孩子说的，在学校里，有的老师大概也有点类乎我的“爸爸作风”，从教室到操场，从正规学习到一天半天的野外旅行，都要牧鸭似地跟在学生屁股后面赶，甚至三天两天的节日假期，各色各样的集体活动安排得密密麻麻的，一分钟的空隙也没有……
    这样作，我是能够理解的，那就是出于关心学生的好心眼，惟恐一眨眼，学生就会脱缰野马似地闯乱子。然而效果怎样呢，还是我的孩子说的对：
    “老师们总以为管的越紧越好，其实我们又不是一尊泥菩萨，当然受不了，有时甚至弄得老师竖起眉毛苦恼，何苦啊！有一次，我们全校分班出发郊区旅行，班班都有老师照管着，惟独我们这个班，老师不巧病了，没法管，嘿嘿，我们自己处理得一切满好，回来以后学校还表扬哩。”
    这么说，自然不能据以得出结论说：“好，一切听任孩子去，爸爸、老师们装聋卖哑闭紧眼睛算了。”
    不，我的孩子不是这个意思。他所抗议的，只不过是我的以及类乎我的某些老师们的“爸爸作风”要不得，提醒有着这种不正确的“作风”的人，不要把年青一代培养成泥菩萨。
