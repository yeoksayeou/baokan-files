Travels in Egypt

(XIV) The Great Ancient City of Thebes

    The sun set behind the pyramids. Around six o'clock in the evening, we took a train south from Cairo. Looking out the train window, we saw a lovely green field, with donkeys, camels, and cattle and sheep walking in the fields. Sugarcane and wheat were already ripe, and some sugarcane fields and wheat fields had already been harvested.

    We spent a night on the train. The next morning at nine o'clock, the train brought us to a corner of the ancient Egyptian capital, Thebes—Luxor.

    At the end of the 16th century BC, the Egyptians victoriously resisted the invasion of the Hyksos, laying the foundation for the prosperity and flourishing of Thebes. For nearly a thousand years, glorious Thebes was one of the golden ages in Egyptian history. From the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea, from tropical Africa and the oases of the Sahara, people transported treasures and wealth to Thebes. The great Greek poet Homer once described Thebes this way: "Only the fine grains of sand can measure the wealth hidden in Thebes and its hundred gates."

    Long ago, all the palaces and houses of Thebes had been destroyed. What remains now are many magnificent temples, towering obelisks, and huge stone statues.

    Today's Luxor and its nearby village of Karnak are part of the destroyed city of Thebes. We took a horse-drawn carriage around the city. The rumble of the carriage and the rhythmic clip-clop of the horses' hooves made us feel as if we were living in a world from centuries ago.

    Walking into the ancient ruins of Luxor and Karnak felt like walking into a forest of stones. It's hard to imagine how the Egyptians of the distant past were able to organize these tall stones according to ingenious designs.

    In the Temple of Amun (god of harvest) in Karnak, we saw an ocean of stones. Inside the main gate, there was a long row of stone-carved rams, surrounded by stacks of stone walls. Crossing the gate of a wall, we saw the magnificent Temple of Amun. This was built by King Ramses III of ancient Egypt around the twelfth year BC. There was a time in Egyptian history when every king had to build temples, stone pillars, or statues for the god Amun.

    Near the temple, there were many statues of Ramses III. He held a royal whip, with his hands crossed, imitating the posture of an immortal god. We also saw a hall composed of more than one hundred and thirty thick stone pillars. Each pillar was about twenty meters high and more than five meters in diameter. It would take eight people with outstretched arms to embrace it. The pillars were carved with ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs.

    In another place near the temple, there was a large area of ​​scattered rubble. An obelisk about forty meters high stood tall in the rubble. This obelisk was built more than three thousand four hundred years ago by the famous Egyptian Queen Hatshepsut, and it was carved from a complete piece of stone. As we visited, we curiously discussed how this obelisk could have been erected in ancient times.

    Not far from the Queen's obelisk, there were piles of stone bricks, with hieroglyphs carved on them. These stone bricks were recently excavated from underground. According to archaeologists, there was a temple here around 1300 BC, and the Egyptians are now trying to piece these stone bricks together as they were, to restore this historical site.

    An Egyptian archaeologist from Luxor accompanied us on our visit. He said to us, "In the past, there were dozens of tall obelisks here, but they were all stolen and transported to New York, London, and Paris, while we Egyptians ourselves lost them." He continued, "Therefore, after the founding of the Republic of Egypt, a decree was issued prohibiting anyone from taking even a piece of rubble from the ancient ruins of Luxor." When you arrive in Luxor, don't look down on those scattered rubble stones, because every piece of rubble here is a cultural heritage treasured by the Egyptian people.

    埃及纪游

    （十四）伟大的古城底比斯
    太阳落到了金字塔的后方，傍晚六点钟光景，我们搭火车离开罗南行。从车窗眺望出去，一片可爱的绿野，及在田野上走着驴子、骆驼和牛羊，甘蔗和小麦都已经成熟，有些甘蔗田和麦田已经收割完毕了。
    在火车上度过了一个夜晚。第二天上午九点钟，列车把我们带到了古代埃及伟大的京城底比斯的一角——拉克索。
    纪元前十六世纪末叶，埃及人胜利地抗击了海克索斯人的入侵，奠定了底比斯的昌盛和繁荣的基础。将近一千年期间，光荣的底比斯成为埃及历史上的黄金时代之一。从波斯湾和红海，从热带非洲和撒哈拉的绿洲上，人们把珍宝和财富都运到底比斯来。古希腊的伟大诗人荷马曾经这样描写过底比斯：“只有沙土的细粒才能够斗量蕴藏在底比斯和它的一百个城门里的财富。”
    很久以前，底比斯的所有的宫殿和房屋建筑就已经被毁了。现在还剩下的是许多宏伟的寺庙、高耸的尖标和巨大的石雕像。
    今天的拉克索和它的附近的克尔纳克村就是被毁的底比斯城的一部分。我们乘着马车逛游市区，辚辚的车声和有节奏的马蹄嗒嗒声，使我们感到仿佛是生活在好多世纪以前的世界里。
    走进了拉克索和卡尔纳克的古迹区，犹如走进了石头的森林。简直很难捉摸，在那遥远的过去，埃及人是用什么办法把这些高大的石头按照巧妙的设计组织起来的。
    在卡尔纳克的阿蒙（丰收之神）神庙，我们看到了石头的海洋。在正门里面，有一长列石头雕塑的公羊，四周是一垛一垛石头的围墙。跨过一道围墙的大门，就看到了规模宏大的阿蒙神的寺庙。这是纪元前十二年左右古埃及白王帝拉美西三世建立的。曾经在埃及的历史上有一个时期，每一代国王都要为阿蒙神建立庙宇，石柱或塑像。
    在神庙附近，树立着许多拉美西三世的塑像。他手执皇鞭，双手交叉，模仿永生神的姿态。还能见到由一百三十多根粗大的石柱组成的大厅。每根石柱高约二十多公尺，直径在五公尺以上，八个人伸直双臂，才能围抱住它。石柱上雕刻着古埃及的象形文字。
    在神庙附近的另一个地方，出现了一大片散乱的颓石。在乱石中耸立着一个高约四十公尺的尖标。这个标石是在三千四百多年以前由埃及著名的女王赫切普舒塔建立的，用一块完整的石块雕琢而成。我们一边参观，一边好奇地讨论着这一块尖标在古代是怎样才能够树立起来的。
    离开这座女王的尖标不远，有一堆一堆的石砖，石砖上刻着象形文字。这些石砖都是最近在地下才挖掘出来的。根据考古学家的研究，这里在纪元前一千三百年左右有一座庙，埃及人现在正设法要把这些石砖按照原样拼起来，恢复这个古迹。
    拉克索当地的一位埃及考古学家陪同我们一起参观。他对我们说：“从前，这里有几十座高大的尖标，但是都被盗运到纽约、伦敦和巴黎去了，而我们埃及自己却失去了它们。”他接着说：“所以，埃及共和国诞生以后便颁布了一项法令，禁止任何人在拉克索古迹区拿走那怕是一块乱石。”到了拉克索，你千万别瞧不起那些散乱的颓石呵，因为在这里的每一块乱石都是埃及人民所珍惜的文化遗产。
