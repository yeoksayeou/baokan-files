    Plugging Wall Holes
    One day, as soon as the members' meeting of the Dapeng Agricultural Cooperative in Cenbei Township, Xiangyin County, Hunan Province, ended, member Zhang Qiuquan hurried home. Seeing him like this, the members started to discuss: "Why is Zhang Qiuquan walking so fast today? If he could work like that, it would be great!" A few young men, out of curiosity, followed Zhang Qiuquan on tiptoe. Peeking into the house, they found Zhang Qiuquan holding a piece of mud, furiously plastering it on the wall. He was plastering and cursing: "I will block you to death!" Everyone felt very strange. After inquiring, Old Zhang finally revealed the truth:
    It turned out that Zhang Qiuquan was a bachelor. When it came to work, he was a master of all trades. After joining the agricultural cooperative last year, he was rated a full ten points for his basic work. Logically speaking, he should earn more work points than others. However, after joining the cooperative, he saw that some families of five or six had only one or two laborers; he was also considered one laborer on his own. Furthermore, during the pre-distribution of spring harvest crops, the cooperative prioritized households in difficulty. Therefore, he never listened when the cooperative promoted "more work, more gain." He often said: "Why be so active? After the autumn harvest, it will still be distributed evenly!"
    After spring plowing began, he dug a small hole in the wall near the head of his bed. Every morning when he woke up, he would look at the fields through the hole. If he saw no one in the fields, he would turn over and sleep again, until all the other members had arrived. Then he would slowly get up, cook, and only go to the fields in the late morning to start work. After working for a short while, he would rest again. Each day, he could only earn five or six work points at most. In more than half a year, he had not even earned five hundred work points, while other members had generally earned one thousand work points, and some even more. At first, he didn't care. It wasn't until the cooperative announced the pre-distribution plan on July 9th, that each laborer would receive eighty or ninety yuan in advance, while he would only receive thirty yuan. Only then did he regret it, and angrily ran home to block the wall hole.
    Now, Zhang Qiuquan no longer peeks through the wall hole. He has arranged to eat with his neighbors and goes to the fields early every morning, now able to earn eleven or twelve work points a day. The members say: Zhang Qiuquan is truly a different person before and after the pre-distribution.

    农村新事
    堵墙眼
    一天，湖南省湘阴县岑北乡大鹏农业社的社员大会刚一收场，社员张秋泉就急急忙忙地往家跑。社员们看到他这个样子，就纷纷议论开了：“张秋泉今天走起路来为什么像开车一样快？做工夫能这样就好啰！”有几个小伙子因为好奇，他们一邀合，就蹑手蹑脚跟在张秋泉的屁股后面。偷偷往屋里一看，发现张秋泉正捧着一块烂泥巴，气冲冲地往壁上乱糊。他一边糊、一边骂：“老子非堵死你不可！”大家感到很奇怪，过后一打听，老张才吐露了真情：
    原来张秋泉是个单身汉，论做工夫他是个全把式，去年参加农业社后，底分就评了整整十分。照理说，他做的工分应该比别人多得多。可是他入社后，看到别人一家五、六口人只有个把劳动力；自家一个人也是一个劳动力；春收作物预支时，社里又重点照顾了困难户，所以他每当社里宣传“多劳多得”时，总是听不进去。他常说：“何必那样积极，秋收后还不是打乱平分！”
    春耕开始后，他在住房的床档头的壁上挖了一个小孔，每天早晨醒来时，总要对着小孔望望田里，看到田里没人，就翻转身来再睡一觉，一直睡到别的社员都来齐了，他才慢腾腾地起床，煮饭吃，到前半晌才下田生产。到田后，做不了一阵子活，就又是休息，每天最多只能做五、六分工。多半年的时间，他一共还没有做到五百分工，别的社员一般都做到了一千分工，有的更多。他起初还不在意，直到7月9日社里预分方案公布后，每个劳动力都是预分八十元或九十元，他却只能分到三十多元。这时，他才后悔起来，一气跑回家去堵壁孔。
    现在，张秋泉不再从墙孔张望了。他把伙食搭到邻居家里，每天早早就下地，一天能做到十一、二分工。社员们说：张秋泉在预分前后真是两个样。
