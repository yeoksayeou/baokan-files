Comrade Wang Enmao, First Secretary of the CPC Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region Committee, spoke:
I fully agree with and support Comrade Mao Zedong's opening speech and the reports of Comrades Liu Shaoqi, Deng Xiaoping, and Zhou Enlai.
Since the Seventh National Congress, under the guidance of the correct political line of the Party Central Committee, our country's ethnic work, like other aspects of work, has achieved tremendous accomplishments. The Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, one of the major areas of minority nationalities in our country, has also made remarkable achievements in the Party's work in this region.
Under the victorious situation of the national revolutionary war, Xinjiang achieved peaceful liberation in 1949. The Chinese People's Liberation Army entered Xinjiang and joined forces with the national army that persisted in the national revolution in the three districts (Ili, Tacheng, Altay), thereby overthrowing the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang throughout Xinjiang, politically ending national oppression, and realizing national equality.
Since the liberation of Xinjiang, the Party has carried out a great deal of work in this region over the past seven years, mainly:
Completed land reform in agricultural areas, distributing more than 7.3 million mu of land to landless and land-poor peasants, and eliminating feudal forces.
In accordance with the policy of national regional autonomy, national regional autonomy was completed.
Socialist transformation has been carried out on agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce and decisive victories have been achieved. The socialist transformation of animal husbandry has also basically completed preparatory work and is about to begin.
Economic and cultural construction has been developed: after liberation, modern industries with considerable scale have been established - iron and steel, non-ferrous and rare metals, petroleum, electricity, coal, cement, agricultural machinery manufacturing, automobile repair and assembly, tractor repair and assembly, textile, printing and dyeing, silk reeling and other factories and mines. The total value of industrial production in 1955 reached 200.27 million yuan, an increase of nearly 35 times compared with 1949; agriculture has been developed, and grain output in 1955 reached 3.8 billion jin, an increase of 88 percent compared with 1949, and cotton output reached 52.22 million jin, an increase of more than four times compared with 1949; animal husbandry has been developed, with more than 18.75 million head of livestock in 1955, an increase of 56 percent compared with 1949 (weak); transportation has been developed, with a highway mileage of 8,939 kilometers in 1955, an increase of 183 percent compared with 1949, and a cargo volume of 5,295,266 tons in 1955, an increase of more than 27 times compared with 1950; state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce have been developed, with a turnover of 450.297 million yuan in 1955, an increase of nearly 17 times compared with 1950; culture and education have been developed, with a total of more than 540,000 students in higher, secondary and primary schools in 1956, an increase of 150 percent compared with 1949. This has greatly improved the material and cultural life of the people of all ethnic groups in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, and at the same time has created certain conditions for the further development of economic and cultural construction in this region in the future.
Party organizations have been established and developed among all ethnic groups. The Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region currently has 62,479 party members (excluding military party members), of which 27,833 are party members from local ethnic groups. Party committees at all levels have local ethnic cadres participating and holding important leading positions.
Local ethnic cadres have been trained. The Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region currently has 92,008 cadres, of which 51,106 are local ethnic cadres. Governments at all levels are led by local ethnic cadres who use their own ethnic languages and scripts to exercise their rights as masters of their own affairs.
The peaceful liberation of the Xinjiang region and the series of ethnic work that our party has carried out in this region over the past seven years have united all ethnic groups in Xinjiang more closely than ever before. Now it is impossible for any imperialists and counter-revolutionaries to provoke ethnic divisions and undermine the unity of the motherland.
The Party has carried out a lot of work in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region and has also gained many useful experiences. Now I will only talk about a few issues related to democratic reform, socialist transformation and socialist construction.
In minority areas, democratic reforms and socialist transformations must be carried out in different ways according to the specific circumstances, otherwise it will be impossible to build socialism.
The people of all ethnic groups in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region have a very high degree of awareness and enthusiasm for democratic reform and socialist transformation, which is a favorable condition for the Party to carry out democratic reform and socialist transformation in this region. However, Xinjiang is a multi-ethnic region, the vast majority of ethnic groups believe in religion, and the influence of ethnic divisions caused by the reactionary ruling class in the past is very serious. Counter-revolutionaries can easily use ethnic and religious issues to resist democratic reform and socialist transformation. This is the difficult situation in carrying out democratic reform and socialist transformation in this region. In response to this situation, we emphasized ethnic unity from the beginning of our work, adhered to the freedom of religious belief, and attached importance to doing a good job in the united front, especially doing a good job in the united front work of ethnic upper-class figures, tribal leaders in pastoral areas, and religious figures, arranging their status politically, maintaining long-term unity and cooperation with them, and taking care of their interests economically, maintaining their original living standards, so that they supported the democratic reform and socialist transformation, and so that counter-revolutionaries had no chance to take advantage of, thus ensuring the smooth progress and victory of various tasks.
The Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region has vast agricultural and pastoral areas. The situations in these two regions are different. We did not adopt the method of the land reform movement in agricultural areas to carry out democratic reform in pastoral areas. Instead, we adopted a longer period of time to implement a policy of no struggle, no division, no class division, benefiting both herdsmen and owners, and developing animal husbandry, including the economy of herd owners; while consolidating social order, transforming the old regime, strengthening the people's regime, establishing Party organizations in pastoral areas, training cadres in pastoral areas, developing mutual aid and cooperation organizations in animal husbandry, experimenting with animal husbandry production cooperatives, establishing state-owned ranches, and developing animal husbandry, agriculture, commerce, transportation, culture, education and health in pastoral areas, etc. Many of these tasks actually have the nature of democratic reform, implemented democratic reform in many aspects, and at the same time prepared conditions for the socialist transformation of animal husbandry. As for certain democratic reform tasks that have not yet been completed, they are planned to be completed simultaneously in the process of completing the socialist transformation. Experience has proven that this can smoothly complete the tasks of democratic reform and socialist transformation in pastoral areas, and ensure that animal husbandry is not damaged and can be further developed.
In carrying out democratic reform and socialist transformation in minority areas, it must be emphasized to adhere to the principle of prudence and steady progress, and to make full preparations, especially to use a relatively long period of time to do a good job in the publicity and education of the Party's policies, training cadres, and conducting experiments.
In carrying out democratic reform and socialist transformation in minority areas, a certain number of experienced and capable Han cadres are needed to help, but the most important thing is to rely on training local ethnic cadres to carry it out. Only by training a large number of local ethnic cadres can we do a good job in democratic reform and socialist transformation. The idea that local ethnic cadres cannot do a good job in democratic reform and socialist transformation has no basis.
In our democratic reform and socialist transformation in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, we opposed both the right-leaning deviation of underestimating the degree of awareness and enthusiasm of minority nationalities and not daring to actively carry out democratic reform and socialist transformation; on the other hand, we opposed the "left"-leaning deviation of underestimating the difficulties of carrying out democratic reform and socialist transformation in minority areas and thus being impatient and rash. This is an important condition for ensuring the victory of democratic reform and socialist transformation. Our experience has proven that it is necessary to pay special attention to preventing and overcoming "left"-leaning deviations in this region. The problems that currently exist in the socialist transformation of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region are mainly subjectivism, coercion, disregarding ethnic characteristics, not consulting with the masses, not accepting the opinions of the masses, not patiently conducting persuasion and education, and not caring about the personal interests of the masses. And the bureaucracy of our leadership is an important reason why these phenomena are so serious. Therefore, we must oppose bureaucracy, go deep among the masses, go deep into reality, and discover and resolutely overcome these phenomena in a timely manner. Otherwise, it will hinder us from consolidating the achievements of the socialist transformation.
The people of all ethnic groups in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, who have been politically liberated and have improved their level of awareness, have a very strong desire to change the serious economic and cultural backwardness left to them by history, to build socialism, and to develop the economy and culture of their own ethnic groups in order to catch up with the level of advanced ethnic groups. Our Party must do everything possible to lead and help them realize this desire. This is the long-term central task of our Party's work in minority areas. Only by realizing this task can we finally solve the national problem. But to realize this task in a relatively short period of time and at a relatively fast speed, in addition to mainly relying on the efforts of the people of all ethnic groups themselves, we must also have strong support from the state and fraternal ethnic groups, especially the Han people. In the past seven years, the state has given great support to the people of all ethnic groups in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. This is an extremely important reason why the economic and cultural construction of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region has been able to achieve great development in a short period of time. However, from the perspective of the economic and cultural development needs of the people of all ethnic groups in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, the state should give greater support to this region in the future.
The production and construction corps of the Xinjiang Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army has played a great role in overcoming financial difficulties and carrying out economic construction in the past, and will play a greater role in future economic construction. We request that the state solve the problems of this unit as a matter of supporting the economic construction of minority nationalities, and give them greater attention and necessary investment.
Helping minority nationalities develop their economy and culture so that they can quickly catch up with the level of advanced nationalities is the glorious historical and political task of our Party and state, and the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region accounts for one-sixth of the country's area, with fertile land and abundant resources, especially rich in oil, non-ferrous metals, and rare metals. Developing the economy and culture there is of utmost importance to the construction of our country into a great socialist country. However, since the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region is located in a remote area, transportation is inconvenient, and the original economic and cultural foundation is weak, especially the industrial foundation is very weak, there are currently many difficulties in carrying out economic and cultural construction there, and the investment is also relatively large. Therefore, we must not be afraid of difficulties and not hesitate to make larger investments in order to develop the economy and culture there. If we are concerned about the many difficulties and large investments, and do not take a positive attitude towards developing the economy and culture there, it is not correct. At present, the democratic reform in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region has long been completed, and the socialist transformation has achieved a decisive victory. Agricultural and animal husbandry production and other economic construction have been developed, and the Lanzhou-Urumqi-Aktogay railway will soon enter Xinjiang. What is particularly exciting is that both Comrade Liu Shaoqi's political report and Comrade Zhou Enlai's report on the proposal for the Second Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy at this conference mentioned that the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region is designated as one of China's new industrial bases, which shows that the conditions for large-scale industrial construction in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region have begun to take shape. Under this circumstance, we must mobilize all forces and speed up the completion of all preparatory work to meet the task of large-scale industrial construction that is about to come. However, it should be admitted that our preparations for welcoming large-scale industrial construction are very inadequate. At present, our geological exploration forces, basic construction forces, transportation forces, commercial forces, cadre forces, etc. are all very insufficient, and even the development of agriculture and animal husbandry is still very insufficient. A series of problems urgently need to be solved by us as soon as possible. To this end, we must currently focus on completing the socialist transformation and further developing agricultural and animal husbandry production, while actively running a number of local industries that can be run, strengthening geological exploration, expanding basic construction forces, striving to support railway construction, developing transportation, commerce, and culture and education, and doing a good job in training cadres, especially local ethnic cadres. Otherwise, our work will not be able to adapt to the requirements of large-scale industrial construction.
The Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region will encounter difficulties on the road to industrial construction, but we believe that with the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee, the efforts of the five million people of all ethnic groups in the entire autonomous region, and the support of the people of all ethnic groups across the country and the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries, difficulties can be overcome and the victory of industrial construction can be achieved.
Finally, we believe that the line determined by the "Eighth National Congress" is a completely correct line. Under the guidance of this line, the people of all ethnic groups in our country will surely achieve the victory of socialist construction, and the people of all ethnic groups in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region will surely transition together with the people of all ethnic groups across the country to a prosperous and happy socialist society.

    为新疆维吾尔自治区各族人民和全国各族人民共同过渡到社会主义而奋斗
    中共新疆维吾尔自治区委员会第一书记王恩茂同志的发言
    我完全同意和拥护毛泽东同志的开幕词、刘少奇同志、邓小平同志和周恩来同志的报告。
    “七大”以来，在党中央的正确政治路线指导下，我国的民族工作和其它各方面工作一样获得了巨大成就。新疆维吾尔自治区，是我国少数民族主要地区之一，党在这一地区的工作，也同样获得了显著的成绩。
    在全国革命战争胜利的形势下，一九四九年新疆实现了和平解放，中国人民解放军进入新疆和坚持三区（伊犁、塔城、阿勒泰）民族革命的民族军会师，从而在全疆范围内推翻了国民党反动统治，在政治上结束了民族压迫，实现了民族平等。
    新疆解放后，七年来党在这一地区进行了许多工作，主要的是：
    完成了农业区的土地改革，分配了七百三十余万亩土地给无地和少地的农民，消灭了封建势力。
    按照民族区域自治的政策，完成了民族区域自治。
    对农业、手工业、资本主义工商业实行了社会主义改造并取得了决定性的胜利。对畜牧业的社会主义改造，目前也基本上完成了准备工作，并即将开始进行。
    发展了经济、文化建设事业：解放后建立了具有相当规模的近代工业——钢铁、有色金属和稀有金属、石油、电力、煤炭、水泥、农具制造、汽车修配、拖拉机修配、纺织、印染、缫丝等厂矿。一九五五年工业生产总值达二亿零二十七万元，比一九四九年增长近三十五倍；发展了农业，一九五五年粮食产量达三十八亿斤，比一九四九年增长百分之八十八，棉花产量达五千二百二十万斤，比一九四九年增长四倍多；发展了畜牧业，一九五五年牲畜达一千八百七十五万余头，比一九四九年增长百分之五十六（弱）；发展了交通运输事业，一九五五年公路通车里程达八千九百三十九公里，比一九四九年增长百分之一百八十三，一九五五年汽车货运量达五百二十九万五千二百六十六吨，比一九五○年增长二十七倍多；发展了国营商业和合作社商业，一九五五年营业额达四亿五千二百九十七万元，比一九五○年增长近十七倍；发展了文化教育事业，一九五六年高等、中等和小学学生共达五十四万多名，比一九四九年增长百分之一百五十。这就使新疆维吾尔自治区各族人民的物质和文化生活得到了很大改善，同时也为这一地区今后经济、文化建设事业的进一步发展创造了一定的条件。
    在各民族中建立和发展了党的组织，新疆维吾尔自治区现有党员六万二千四百七十九名（除军队党员在外），其中有本地各民族的党员二万七千八百三十三名。各级党委都有本地民族干部参加，并且担任着重要的领导工作。
    培养了本地各民族干部，新疆维吾尔自治区现有干部九万二千零八名，其中本地民族干部五万一千一百零六名。各级政府都是本地民族干部担任主要的领导职务，使用本民族的文字语言，行使自己当家作主的权利。
    新疆地区的和平解放和七年来我们党在这一地区所进行的这一系列的民族工作，使新疆各民族空前未有地亲密地团结起来。现在任何帝国主义和反革命分子要想挑拨民族团结和破坏祖国统
  一都是不可能了。
    党在新疆维吾尔自治区进行了许多工作，也获得了许多有益的经验，现在我只讲一下其中有关民主改革、社会主义改造和社会主义建设的几个问题。
    在少数民族地区，必须根据具体情况采用不同方式进行民主改革和社会主义改造，否则，要建设社会主义是不可能的。
    新疆维吾尔自治区各族人民要求民主改革和社会主义改造的觉悟程度和积极性是很高的，这是党在这一地区进行民主改革和社会主义改造的有利条件。但是，新疆是一个多民族地区，极大多数民族信仰宗教，过去反动统治阶级造成的民族隔阂所遗留下来的影响是很严重的，反革命分子容易利用民族问题和宗教问题来反抗民主改革和社会主义改造。这是在这一地区进行民主改革和社会主义改造的困难情况。针对这一情况，我们工作开始就强调了民族团结，坚持了宗教信仰自由，重视了做好统一战线工作特别是做好民族上层人士、牧区部落头目和宗教人士的统一战线工作，在政治上安排他们的地位，保持同他们长期团结和合作，在经济上照顾他们的利益，保持他们原有的生活水平，这样就取得了他们对民主改革和社会主义改造的拥护，并使得反革命分子无隙可乘，从而保证了各项工作的顺利进行和取得胜利。
    新疆维吾尔自治区有广大的农业区和畜牧业区。这两种地区的情况是不同的。我们没有采取像农业区土地改革运动的办法，在畜牧业区进行民主改革，而是以比较长的时间，在这种地区一面实行不斗不分，不划阶级，牧工牧主两利，发展包括牧主经济在内的畜牧业的政策；一面巩固社会治安，改造旧政权，加强人民政权，建立牧区党的组织，培养牧区干部，发展畜牧业互助合作组织，试办畜牧业生产合作社，建立国营牧场，发展畜牧业区的牧业、农业、商业、交通运输业、文化、教育和卫生事业等，其中许多工作，实际上带有民主改革的性质，在很多方面实行了民主改革，同时为畜牧业社会主义改造准备了条件。至于某些尚未完成的民主改革任务，则准备在完成社会主义改造中去同时完成。经验证明：这样做既能顺利完成畜牧业区民主改革和社会主义改造的任务，又保证了畜牧业不受破坏而能得到进一步的发展。
    在少数民族地区进行民主改革和社会主义改造，必须强调坚持慎重稳进方针，充分地做好准备工作，特别是要用比较长的时间，做好党的政策的宣传教育、训练干部、试办等工作。
    在少数民族地区进行民主改革和社会主义改造，需要有一定数量有经验有能力的汉族干部的帮助，但最主要的是要依靠培养本地民族干部去进行。只有大量培养本地民族干部，才能做好民主改革和社会主义改造工作。那种不相信本地民族干部能够做好民主改革和社会主义改造工作的想法，是没有任何根据的。
    我们在新疆维吾尔自治区的民主改革和社会主义改造事业中，一方面反对了对少数民族的觉悟程度和积极性估计不足，不敢积极进行民主改革和社会主义改造的右倾偏向；另一方面，反对了对少数民族地区进行民主改革和社会主义改造的困难估计不足因而急躁冒进的“左”倾偏向。这是保证取得民主改革和社会主义改造胜利的重要条件。我们的经验证明，在这种地区必须特别注意防止和克服的是“左”倾偏向。现在新疆维吾尔自治区社会主义改造中所存在的问题，主要是主观主义，强迫命令，不照顾民族特点，不和群众商量，不接受群众意见，不耐心进行说服教育，不关心群众个人利益等现象。而我们领导上的官僚主义，则是这些现象所以严重的重要原因。因此，我们必须反对官僚主义，深入群众，深入实际，及时发现并坚决克服这些现象。否则，它就将妨碍我们巩固社会主义改造胜利的成果。
    在政治上获得了解放并且提高了觉悟水平的新疆维吾尔自治区各族人民，对于改变历史上遗留给他们的经济、文化落后的严重状况，建设社会主义，发展本民族的经济和文化，以求赶上先进民族的水平具有十分强烈的愿望，我们党必须尽一切努力来领导和帮助他们实现这一愿望，这是我们党在少数民族地区工作的长期的中心任务，只有实现了这一任务，才能最后地解决民族问题。但要在比较短的时间内以比较快的速度来实现这一任务，除了主要的要依靠各族人民自己的努力之外，还必须要有国家和兄弟民族特别是汉族人民的大力支援。过去七年中，国家对新疆维吾尔自治区各族人民给了很大的支援。这是新疆维吾尔自治区的经济和文化建设事业所以能够在短期内获得很大发展的极为重要的原因。但是，从新疆维吾尔自治区各族人民的经济、文化发展的需要来说，国家今后还应该对这个地区给予更大的支援。
    中国人民解放军新疆军区的生产建设部队，过去在克服财政困难和进行经济建设的事业中已经起到了很大的作用，在今后的经济建设事业中还将起到更大的作用。我们要求国家把这支部队的问题，当作是支援少数民族经济建设的问题来加以解决，对他们给予更大的重视和必需的投资。
    帮助少数民族发展经济和文化使之迅速赶上先进民族的水平是我们党和国家光荣的历史政治任务，而新疆维吾尔自治区的面积占全国六分之一，土地肥沃，资源丰富，特别是石油、有色金属、稀有金属蕴藏丰富，发展那里的经济和文化建设事业，对于我国建设成为伟大的社会主义国家具有极为重要的意义。但是由于新疆维吾尔自治区地处边远，交通不便，原有经济、文化基础薄弱，特别是工业基础很薄弱，目前在那里进行经济、文化建设事业，困难较多，投资也要较大。因此，必须不怕困难和不惜较大投资才能发展那里的经济、文化建设事业。如果顾虑困难多、投资大，对于发展那里的经济和文化建设事业不采取积极的态度是不正确的。目前新疆维吾尔自治区民主改革早已完成，社会主义改造业已取得了决定性的胜利。农、牧业生产和其它经济建设事业有了发展，兰州——乌鲁木齐——阿克斗卡铁路，不久就要进入新疆，特别令人兴奋的是此次大会刘少奇同志的政治报告和周恩来同志关于发展国民经济的第二个五年计划的建议的报告，都说到确定新疆维吾尔自治区为我国新的工业基地之一，这表明新疆维吾尔自治区大规模工业建设的条件已经开始形成。在这种情况下，我们必须动员一切力量，加紧完成一切准备工作，以迎接就要到来的大规模工业建设的任务。但是，应当承认，我们对于迎接大规模工业建设的准备工作，是做得很不充分的。目前我们的地质勘察力量、基本建设力量、交通运输力量、商业力量、干部力量等等都十分不够，就是农业、畜牧业的发展也还很不够。这一系列的问题亟需我们及早地加以解决。为此，目前我们必须以完成社会主义改造和进一步发展农牧业生产为中心，同时积极兴办可能兴办的若干地方工业，加强地质勘察工作，扩大基本建设力量，努力支援铁路建筑，发展交通运输、商业和文化教育，做好培养干部特别是本地民族干部的工作。否则，我们的工作就将不能适应大规模工业建设的要求。
    新疆维吾尔自治区在工业建设的道路上，是会遇到困难的，但是我们相信有党中央的正确领导，有全自治区五百万各民族人民的努力，有全国各民族人民和苏联及各兄弟国家的支援，困难是可以克服的，工业建设的胜利是可以获得的。
    最后，我们相信“八大”决定的路线是完全正确的路线，在这一路线的指导下，我国各民族人民一定能取得社会主义建设的胜利，新疆维吾尔自治区各民族人民也一定能和全国各民族人民共同过渡到繁荣、幸福的社会主义社会。
