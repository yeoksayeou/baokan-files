Xinhua News Agency, September 21st: According to TASS, Cairo, September 20th: Egyptian newspapers attach great importance to the reply of the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Bulganin, to the questions raised by Kingsbury Smith. All newspapers published the full text of Bulganin's reply under headline banners.

The "Al-Gomhuria," "Al Shaab," "Al Akhbar," "Egyptian Gazette," and "Egyptian Progress" used such colorful headlines as: "Bulganin Advocates Convening a Six-Nation Conference on the Suez Canal Issue," "Russia Proposes Holding a Six-Nation Conference in Geneva," etc.

An editorial in the "Egyptian Gazette" emphasized that Bulganin's statement that the Soviet government was prepared to participate in six-nation talks on the Suez issue had attracted the attention of world opinion. The newspaper wrote that his words opened the way to easing the current tensions and resolving the Suez issue as soon as possible.

"Al Shaab" welcomed the proposal for a meeting of the heads of government of the Soviet Union, Egypt, India, France, Britain, and the United States.

Xinhua News Agency, September 21st: According to TASS reports: British, French, and American newspapers are paying close attention to Bulganin's reply to Kingsbury Smith, Vice President of the International News Service, on the Suez Canal issue.

In Britain, the "Daily Worker," "The Times," and the "Daily Telegraph and Morning Post" published the full text of the questions and answers. The bourgeois newspapers believe that this proposal may hinder the actions of Western countries.

The diplomatic correspondent of the "Evening Standard" said: "Countries that oppose the three major powers' plan to establish an association of Suez Canal user nations may see the proposal to convene a six-nation conference as a new way to resolve the Suez Canal crisis."

The French "Liberation" pointed out that a six-nation summit would lead to a peaceful resolution of the Suez Canal issue. However, right-wing newspapers in Paris opposed convening this meeting. The newspaper said that French "authorities" considered the proposal to convene the meeting "unacceptable."

In the United States, the "New York Times" published a report from its Moscow correspondent on Bulganin's reply to Kingsbury Smith in the first column. The "New York Herald Tribune" also published the full text of the reply. Other newspapers also published relevant news in prominent positions.

U.S. State Department spokesman White and White House Press Secretary Hagerty both declined to comment on Bulganin's reply. However, according to Reuters, quoting "well-informed sources," the foreign ministers of Britain, France, and the United States held a special meeting on the morning of the 20th to discuss Bulganin's reply to the reporter's questions.

    埃报热烈欢迎布尔加宁的新建议
    认为打开了尽速解决苏伊士运河问题的道路
    英法美报纸也很重视　华盛顿当局拒绝评论
    据新华社21日讯　据塔斯社开罗20日讯：埃及报纸十分重视苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁对金斯伯里·史密斯提出的问题的答复。所有的报纸以头条大标题刊载了布尔加宁答复的全文。
    “共和国报”、“人民报”、“消息报”、“埃及日报”和“埃及进步报”用了这样一些彩色标题：“布尔加宁主张召开苏伊士运河问题六国会议”，“俄国建议在日内瓦举行六国会议”等。
    “埃及日报”的社论着重指出，布尔加宁所说的苏联政府准备参加苏伊士问题六国会谈的话，引起了整个世界舆论的注意。这家报纸写道，他的话为缓和目前的紧张局势和尽速解决苏伊士问题打开了道路。
    “人民报”欢迎苏联、埃及、印度、法国、英国和美国的政府首脑举行会谈的主张。
    据新华社21日讯　据塔斯社报道：英、法、美三国报纸都很注意布尔加宁就苏伊士运河问题对国际新闻社副社长金斯伯里·史密斯的答复。
    在英国，“工人日报”、“泰晤士报”和“每日电讯与农邮报”发表了问答的全文。资产阶级的报纸认为，这个建议可能妨碍西方国家的行动。
    “旗帜晚报”的外交评论员说：“反对三大国关于建立苏伊士运河使用国协会的计划的国家，可能把召开六国会议的主张看成是解决苏伊士运河问题危机的新途径。”
    法国“解放报”指出，六国首脑会议会导致苏伊士运河问题的和平解决。但是巴黎右派报纸反对召开这个会议。报纸说，法国的“权威人士”认为，召开会议的建议是“不能接受的”。
    在美国，“纽约时报”在第一栏登载了它的驻莫斯科特派记者报道布尔加宁答金斯伯里·史密斯问的消息。“纽约先驱论坛报”还登载了答复的全文。其他一些报纸也以显著地位刊登了有关消息。
    美国国务院发言人怀特和白宫新闻秘书哈格蒂都拒绝评论布尔加宁的答复。但是，据路透社引用“消息灵通人士”的话说，英、法、美三国外长20日上午举行专门会谈，讨论了布尔加宁的答记者问。
