Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 12th - From January to August this year, textile and dyeing factories in Shanghai successfully trial-produced 127 kinds of special textiles. Twelve factories with outstanding achievements in trial production were awarded banners by the East China Textile Administration Bureau on the 10th, and four of these factories received bonuses ranging from 800 to 2,500 yuan.

These special textiles are urgently needed by heavy industry and the defense industry. Among them are cord fabrics for manufacturing heavy-duty vehicles and aircraft tires, which can withstand high heat and strong tensile forces; yellow wax cloth for use in electrical wire factories; special fabrics that are waterproof, mildew-proof, and corrosion-resistant, which can protect packaged items from deterioration for several years; and bolting cloth used by flour mills to sift flour and by paper mills to filter high-quality pulp. Fireproof cloth, which was only recently successfully trial-produced, will not immediately burn or spread when exposed to fire.

All of these special textiles are of high quality. For example, No. 49 bolting cloth has more than 10,000 holes per square inch, and looks like silk to the naked eye. The holes can only be seen when magnified fifty to one hundred times. Not a single small knot is allowed on these holes.

    上海试制成功一百多种特种纺织品
    新华社上海12日电　今年1月到8月份，上海纺织、印染工厂试制成功一百二十七种特种纺织品。试制有特殊成绩的十二家工厂，10日受到华东纺织管理局颁给的奖旗，其中四家工厂得到八百元到二千五百元的奖金。
    这些特种纺织品，都是重工业和国防工业上极需要的产品。其中有制载重汽车和飞机轮胎用的子帘布，这种布能耐高热，又经得起较强的拉力；有供电线厂用的黄蜡布；有能防水、防霉和防腐的特种布，用这种布包裹的物件，几年不会变质；有面粉厂用来筛面粉、造纸厂用来过滤高级纸浆的筛绢。不久以前才试制成功的防火布，遇火不会马上燃烧或蔓延。
    所有的特种纺织品，质量都很高。例如四十九号筛绢，在一个平方英寸内有一万多个眼孔，粗看上去和绸子一样，要放大五十倍到一百倍，才能看出它的眼孔。在这些眼孔上面不允许有一个细小的结头。
