    This News Headline Is Inaccurate

    The news item on page 7 of this newspaper on September 4, "The Ministry of Education and the Education Trade Union Issue a Notice on Launching an Advanced Worker Movement in Primary, Secondary, and Normal Schools," had a headline that was inconsistent with its content. The news said that there were different opinions on launching the advanced worker movement in schools, and careful research was needed. Before the central government issued instructions, three temporary measures were to be taken, depending on the specific circumstances. However, the headline of this news item did not accurately express this meaning. Many readers have written to point out this error. We hereby issue a correction.

    这条新闻标题是不确切的
    本报9月4日第七版“教育部、教育工会发出通知，在中、小学和师范学校开展先进工作者运动”，这条新闻题文不符。这新闻说，各方面对在学校中开展先进工作者运动有不同的意见，需要作慎重的研究，在中央未作指示前，分别不同的情况，采取三种暂时措施。但是，这则新闻的标题却没有把这个意思正确地表达出来。不少读者来信指出了这个错误，特此更正。
