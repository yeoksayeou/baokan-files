Xinhua News Agency, September 27th (Singapore dispatch): Eighteen warships from five countries of the Manila Treaty Organization began large-scale exercises in the South China Sea on September 26th. This exercise is one of a series of military exercises decided upon by the military advisors of the Manila Treaty Organization in early September.

According to a communiqué from the joint fleet, the exercises will last for a month. The countries participating in the first phase of the exercises are the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and Pakistan. Ships from the Philippines and Thailand will participate in later stages of the exercises. France is only sending observers to the exercises.

The report said that the purpose of this exercise is to train the navies of the Manila Treaty Organization countries to operate as a single force. Almost every aspect of naval and naval-air joint operations is included in the exercise schedule. The exercises will be held off the coast of Thailand and on the route between Bangkok and Hong Kong.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, September 26th: Indonesian political figures have expressed outrage at the military exercises that the Manila Treaty Organization countries began conducting on September 26th in areas close to Indonesia.

Dahlan, chairman of the Indonesian Islamic Teachers Association, said that the Indonesian government should lodge a strong protest against foreign warships using the Java Sea for exercises.

Manuaba, Secretary-General of the Indonesian Nationalist Party, said that this matter could be considered an act of infringing upon Indonesia's territorial integrity and sovereignty.

When asked about the matter, Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Mononutu said, "The Indonesian government will give full consideration to this matter."

    马尼拉集团在南海举行海军演习
    印度尼西亚政界表示强烈反对
    新华社27日讯　新加坡消息：马尼拉条约组织五个国家的十八艘军舰，9月26日开始在南中国海海面举行大规模的演习。这个演习是马尼拉条约组织军事顾问9月初决定要举行的一系列军事演习之一。
    据这个联合舰队的公报说，演习将持续一个月，参加第一阶段演习的国家有美国、英国、澳大利亚、新西兰和巴基斯坦。菲律宾和泰国的船只将参加以后阶段的演习。法国只派观察员参加这次演习。
    消息说，这次演习的目的是为了训练马尼拉条约组织国家的海军作为一支单一的部队进行活动。几乎海军和海空军联合作战的每一方面都包括在演习日程之内。演习将在泰国沿海以及曼谷和香港之间的航线上举行。
    据新华社雅加达26日电　印度尼西亚政界人士对于马尼拉条约组织国家9月26日开始在靠近印度尼西亚地区举行军事演习表示愤慨。
    印度尼西亚伊斯兰教师联合会主席达兰说，印度尼西亚政府对于外国军舰利用爪哇海举行演习应该提出强烈的抗议。
    印度尼西亚国民党总书记马努阿巴说，这件事可以被认为是侵犯印度尼西亚领土完整和主权的行动。
    印度尼西亚外交部发言人莫诺努图在被问到这件事时说，“印度尼西亚政府将充分考虑这件事”。
