    India's Words of Wisdom
    The so-called "Users' Association" plan, jointly concocted by the United States, Britain, and France to rob the Suez Canal, has aroused serious concern and strong opposition from world public opinion. Indian Prime Minister Nehru's speech in the People's Assembly on September 13 is a good illustration of this.

    Prime Minister Nehru pointed out that the actions of the United States, Britain, and France are contrary to the path of peacefully resolving the Suez Canal issue based on respect for Egyptian sovereignty. Its nature is a unilateral, forceful attempt to make Egypt accept a plan that damages its sovereignty and disregards the interests of the canal's user countries. Prime Minister Nehru warned that this approach by the United States, Britain, and France closes the door to further peaceful negotiations and contains a serious danger of war.

    As a peace-loving country, India's grave concern for the current Middle East situation is completely understandable. India has consistently advocated resolving international issues through peaceful consultations in international affairs. Because, like the vast majority of countries in the world, India knows that world peace is indivisible. Today, if the United States, Britain, and France ignite the flames of war in the Middle East, there is a danger of it spreading to other regions, which will undoubtedly seriously affect India's peaceful development.

    Nehru's speech proves that if Britain and France, with the support of the United States, dare to launch a war against Egypt, they will fall into unprecedented isolation. They will inevitably encounter strong opposition from peace-loving people all over the world, and it will be difficult to find any support even within the British Commonwealth. Since the Suez Canal issue arose, the world's sympathy and support have been on the side of the Egyptian people. Many countries in the British Commonwealth have also spoken out righteously, resolutely opposing the crude attempts by the United States, Britain, and France to carry out armed intervention. Many British newspapers are worried that the attempts by Britain and France to launch armed intervention will lead to the disintegration of the British Commonwealth, and this is not without foundation. Because, if Britain completely disregards the interests of peace and India's opinion, and launches a war in the Middle East regardless of everything, it is tantamount to cutting itself off from the peace-loving Indian people and the people of all countries.

    At the same time, India is one of the user countries of the Suez Canal. Today, India clearly sees that the real threat to the freedom of navigation in the Suez Canal does not come from Egypt, but precisely from the crude interference of the United States, Britain, and France in Egyptian sovereignty. Prime Minister Nehru pointed out that the current actions of Britain, France, and other countries in withdrawing non-Egyptian pilots in order to create excuses for armed intervention are not intended to promote the use of the canal, and "therefore are not in the interests of the user countries." Everyone can see that today, under Egyptian management, the shipping of the Suez Canal is unimpeded; but once war breaks out due to the provocations of Britain and France, the navigation of the Suez Canal is likely to be immediately interrupted, which would greatly damage the interests of the canal's user countries.

    Today, hundreds of millions of people in Asian and African countries are closely watching the development of the situation in the Middle East. The Asian and African countries will never agree to the armed intervention of Western colonial countries in Egypt, and the unprecedentedly awakened Asian and African people will resolutely support the just struggle of the Egyptian people to safeguard national independence and state sovereignty. It can be said that Indian Prime Minister Nehru's statement not only reflects the will of the Indian people, but also reflects the will of the broad public in Asian and African countries.

    Nehru's statement is a very calm warning to the United States, Britain, and France. Nehru pointed out that the armed intervention plan of the United States, Britain, and France will bring serious consequences to themselves, and it is not too late to "pull back from the brink" and return to the path of peaceful negotiations. These are India's words of wisdom, and now is the time for the ruling groups of the United States, Britain, and France to seriously consider them.

### 印度的金石良言

    印度的金石良言
    美、英、法三国合伙劫夺苏彝士运河的所谓“使用国协会”计划，已经引起了世界舆论的严重不安和强烈的反对。印度总理尼赫鲁9月13日在人民院的发言，就是很好的说明。
    尼赫鲁总理指出，美、英、法三国的这一行动，是和在尊重埃及主权的基础上和平解决苏彝士运河的途径背道而驰的，它的性质乃是片面地以武力强制埃及接受损害其主权的方案和无视运河各使用国家的利益。尼赫鲁总理警告说，美、英、法三国的这种作法，关闭了进一步和平谈判的大门，包含着严重的战争危机。
    作为一个爱好和平的国家，印度严重地关怀着目前的中东形势，这是完全可以理解的。印度在国际事务中一贯主张经由和平协商的道路来解决国际问题。因为，和世界上绝大多数的国家一样，印度知道，世界的和平是不能分割的。今天，如果美、英、法在中东地区点起了战火，就有延烧到其他地区的危险，这无疑将同样严重地影响到印度的和平发展。
    尼赫鲁的发言证明，如果英、法在美国的支持下敢于向埃及发动战争，它们就会陷于空前孤立的地位，他们必然要遭到全世界爱好和平人民的强烈反对，甚至在英联邦内部也很难找到什么支持。自从苏彝士运河问题发生以来，世界的同情和支持都在埃及人民一方面，英联邦的不少国家也仗义执言，坚决反对美、英、法三国企图武装干涉的粗暴行为。英国许多报纸耽心英、法发动武装干涉的企图会使英联邦陷于分裂，这并不是没有根据的。因为，英国如果根本无视和平的利益，无视印度的意见，而不顾一切地在中东发动战争，就等于是自绝于爱好和平的印度人民和世界各国人民。
    同时，印度是苏彝士运河的使用国之一。今天印度清楚地看到，对于苏彝士运河航行自由的真正威胁并不是来自埃及，而正是来自美、英、法对埃及主权的粗暴干涉。尼赫鲁总理指出，目前英法等国为了替武装干涉制造借口而撤回非埃及籍领航员的行动，不是打算促进运河的使用，“因此是不符合使用国家利益的。”谁都能够看出，今天，在埃及的管理下，苏彝士运河的航运是通行无阻的；可是一旦战争因英法的挑衅而爆发了，苏彝士运河的航行完全有可能立即中断，这就会大大地损害运河使用国的利益。
    今天，亚非国家的亿万人民正密切地注视着中东形势的发展。亚非各国绝不会同意西方殖民国家对埃及的武装干涉，而空前觉醒了的亚非人民将坚决支持埃及人民维护民族独立和国家主权的正义斗争。可以说，印度总理尼赫鲁的声明不但反映了印度人民的意志，而且也反映了目前亚非国家广大公众的意志。
    尼赫鲁的声明是对于美、英、法三国的一个十分冷静的警告。尼赫鲁指出，美、英、法的武装干涉计划将给它们自己带来严重的后果，而现在“悬崖勒马”，回过头来走和平谈判的道路，为时还不太晚。这是印度的金石良言，现在应该是美、英、法统治集团严正考虑的时候了。
