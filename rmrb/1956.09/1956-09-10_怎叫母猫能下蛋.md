　　There is a fable that goes like this: One day, a rooster and a hen were discussing household affairs, and they felt that their work in the world was too busy and their tasks too heavy. The rooster had to crow, and the hen had to lay eggs, so they didn't have a moment of peace. So they called the cat over.

　　"Cat, oh cat, all you ever do is catch mice, and you don't do anything else. Why don't you learn more skills so you can share the housework with us?" As soon as the rooster finished speaking, the hen continued, "Yes, if all the male cats could crow and all the female cats could lay eggs, wouldn't your talents be more comprehensive? This way, everyone can share the housework together, so the busy ones won't be too busy, and the idle ones won't be too idle."

　　Once, a group of college graduates were sent to a state agency in charge of construction to be assigned work. After they arrived, one who had originally studied hydraulic engineering was assigned to build railways; one who had originally studied railway engineering was assigned to carry out building construction projects. So they ran to ask the office director, "What is the reason for this?"

　　"The reason is very simple," the director said, "For example, a hydraulic engineer can only build hydraulic projects, and a railway engineer is skilled in railway engineering but not in building construction. This is to cultivate you into well-rounded individuals!"

　　Such things are like what the fable says. There are some leaders in work departments who only care about their own convenience and do not respect other people's expertise at all. That is: forcing male cats to crow and forcing female cats to lay eggs.

    怎叫母猫能下蛋
  　周容
    有一个寓言这样说，一天，公鸡和母鸡在一起谈家务，它们觉得它们在世间的工作太忙，任务太重，公鸡要打鸣，母鸡要下蛋，日子过得一点也不安闲。于是它们就把猫叫到了跟前。
    “猫呀猫，你们成天就只会捉耗子，此外什么事情也不干，为什么你们不多学些本领，好和我们一起分担家务事？”公鸡刚说完，母鸡接着就说：“是的呀，如果你们只只公猫也都能打鸣，只只母猫也都能下蛋，你们的才能岂不是更全面？这样大家一起把家务分担起来，忙的就不会太忙，闲的也才不会太闲。”
    有一次，一批高等学校毕业的学生被送到一个掌管建设事业的国家机关去分配工作。他们到了那里以后，一个本来是学水利工程的，却被分配去修筑铁道；一个本来是学铁道工程的，却被分配去进行房屋的建筑工程。于是他们就跑去问办公室主任：“这是什么道理？”
    “道理很简单，”主任说，“譬如一个水利工程师就只会建筑水利工程，一个铁道工程师在铁道工程上是能手，在房屋建筑工程上就吃不开了。这是为了把你们培养成为全面发展的人呵！”
    这样的事情同那个寓言所说的一样，有这样一些工作部门的领导者，他们只顾自己的方便，却毫不尊重别人的专长。这就是：硬叫公猫去打鸣，硬叫母猫来下蛋。
