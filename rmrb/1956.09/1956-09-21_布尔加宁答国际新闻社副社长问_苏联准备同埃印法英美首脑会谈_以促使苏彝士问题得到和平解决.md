Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 20th: TASS reports that Soviet Premier Bulganin told Kingsbury Smith, Vice President and General Manager of the American "International News Service," that the Soviet government has already expressed its support for a just and peaceful resolution of the Suez issue through negotiations. To facilitate such a resolution, the Soviet government is prepared to participate in a meeting of the heads of government of Egypt, India, France, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union.

Bulganin's remarks were in response to a question posed by Smith, who asked: "In order to prevent the threat of war in the Middle East, is the Soviet government prepared to immediately participate in talks at the level of heads of state with the governments of Egypt, India, France, Britain, and the United States?"

In a telegram sent to Bulganin, Smith also asked if he believed that a meeting of the aforementioned national leaders could find a peaceful solution to the Suez issue that would both safeguard Egyptian sovereignty and guarantee freedom of navigation on the Suez Canal for all ships in the world.

Bulganin said, "There is no doubt that a peaceful solution to the Suez issue can be found. As everyone knows, the Egyptian government has already expressed its willingness to re-examine the 1888 Constantinople Convention with other relevant countries and to conclude an agreement on the freedom of navigation in the canal. This proposal from Egypt opens the way for a peaceful resolution of the Suez issue."

Bulganin said, "A corresponding agreement on the freedom of navigation in the canal should ultimately be reached through discussions on this issue at a broad international conference with the participation of all relevant countries."

Smith also asked, "If the leaders of the aforementioned countries can reach an agreement on the resolution of the Suez Canal issue, is the Soviet government willing to submit this agreement to the United Nations for approval?"

Bulganin said, "The Soviet government does not object to submitting this agreement to the United Nations."

Regarding the timing and location of the meeting, Bulganin replied that the Soviet government is prepared to participate in such talks at any time and in any appropriate location that the participants deem suitable, provided that the remaining participants mentioned above agree to hold such talks. He said, "The venue could be, for example, Geneva, of course, with the consent of the Swiss government."

    布尔加宁答国际新闻社副社长问
    苏联准备同埃印法英美首脑会谈
    以促使苏彝士问题得到和平解决
    新华社20日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科19日讯：苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁对美国“国际新闻社”副社长兼总经理金斯伯里·史密斯说，苏联政府已经表示主张通过谈判的方式，公正、和平地解决苏彝士问题。为了促使这个问题得到这样的解决，苏联政府准备参加埃及、印度、法国、英国、美国和苏联的政府首脑会议。
    布尔加宁的这番话是他对史密斯所提的一个问题的答复。史密斯的这个问题是：“为了防止中东的战争威胁，苏联政府是否准备立刻参加同埃及、印度、法国、英国和美国政府的国家首脑一级的会谈？”
    史密斯在一封拍给布尔加宁的电报中还问他，他认为上述国家领导人举行会议是否能够找到和平解决苏彝士问题的办法，这种解决办法既要能维护埃及的主权，又要能保证世界上一切船只在苏彝士运河上的航行自由？
    布尔加宁说：“毫无疑问，苏彝士问题的和平解决办法是能够找到的。大家知道，埃及政府已经表示准备同其他有关国家一起重新审查1888年君士坦丁堡公约和缔结关于运河航行自由的协定。埃及的这个建议打开了和平解决苏彝士问题的道路。”
    布尔加宁说，“有关运河航行自由的相应协定，终究应该在一切有关国家参加的广泛的国际会议上，通过对这一问题进行的讨论来达成”。
    史密斯还问：“如果上述国家的领导人能够就解决苏彝士运河问题达成协定，苏联政府是否愿意把这一协定提交联合国批准？”
    布尔加宁说，“苏联政府不反对把这一协定提交联合国。”
    对于举行会议的时间和地点的问题，布尔加宁回答说，苏联政府准备在与会者认为适合的任何时候和任何适当的地点参加这种会谈，只要上述其余各参加者同意举行上述会谈。他说，“会址可以是，例如，日内瓦，当然这得要瑞士政府的赞同”。
