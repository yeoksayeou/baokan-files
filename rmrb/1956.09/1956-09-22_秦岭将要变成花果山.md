    Qinling Mountains Will Become a Fruit and Flower Mountain
    (Our newspaper reports) The vast area on the northern foot of the Qinling Mountains possesses abundant fruit tree resources and will become one of China's important fruit production areas. This was confirmed by Shaanxi Province after conducting a survey of land suitable for orchards on the northern foot of the Qinling Mountains. The Qinling Northern Foothill Orchard Land Survey Team, organized by the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture, completed its work in early August after 120 days of activity, starting in late March this year. Members of the survey team included representatives from six units: the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture, the Northwest Agricultural Science Institute, the Northwest Agricultural College, the Yellow River Engineering Bureau, the Hanzhong Horticultural Station, and the Shaanxi Provincial Agricultural Survey and Design Team. The survey team conducted orchard land surveys in thirteen counties and cities along the northern foot of the Qinling Mountains, from Xiyu in Tongguan in the east to Chaoyu in Baoji in the west, covering an area of approximately 6,195 square li.
    This survey provided an understanding of the natural conditions, fruit tree growth, and distribution on the northern foot of the Qinling Mountains. According to meteorological data, the fruit tree growing season in these areas is 210 to 220 days, which is more favorable than the conditions in the Guanzhong Plain and very suitable for developing fruit trees. Fruit tree survey data proves that the northern foot of the Qinling Mountains has extremely rich fruit tree resources. There are a total of 231 varieties of fruit trees. There are apricot trees here that are 150 years old and still in their prime production period, and persimmon and chestnut trees over 100 years old are very common. Generally, mature crabapple trees produce 200 to 500 jin of fruit per tree; a single grape vine trellis can produce 200 jin, with a yield of approximately 3,500 jin per mu. Many farmers in these areas have rich experience in cultivating fruit trees and can master fruit tree grafting techniques and various land planting conditions.
    Based on the terrain, soil, and other natural conditions on the northern foot of the Qinling Mountains, the survey team proposed that the area suitable for developing orchards is more than 810,000 mu.
    After completing the survey work, the survey team invited professors and experts from the Northwest Agricultural College and the Northwest Agricultural Science Institute for a discussion. Wu Gengmin, a famous Chinese horticulturist and director of the Horticulture Department of Zhejiang University, also participated in the symposium. Everyone unanimously agreed that the northern foot of the Qinling Mountains is a very suitable area for developing apples. The survey team is now formulating a plan for developing fruit trees on the northern foot of the Qinling Mountains based on survey data and opinions from relevant agencies.
    The Shaanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture has already begun to cultivate fruit seedlings, and it is expected that during the second five-year plan period, the transformation of the Qinling Mountains into a fruit and flower mountain can begin.

    秦岭将要变成花果山
    本报讯  秦岭北麓的广大地区拥有大量的果树资源，这里将成我国重要的果品产区之一。这是陕西省在进行秦岭北麓宜园地勘察后肯定的。陕西省农业厅组织的秦岭北麓宜园地勘察队，从今年3月下旬起经过一百二十天的活动，已于8月初完成。参加勘察队的成员有，陕西省农业厅、西北农业科学研究所、西北农学院、黄河工程局、汉中园艺站、陕西省农业勘察设计队等六个单位的代表。勘察队进行了东起潼关的西峪，西至宝鸡晁峪，沿秦岭北麓的潼关、华阴、宝鸡等十三个县市的果树园地勘察，勘察的地区范围约有六千一百九十五平方华里。
    这次勘察，对秦岭北麓的自然情况、果树生长和分布情况进行了了解。从气象资料看来，这些地区的果树生长季节有二百一十至二百二十天。比关中腹地条件优越，对发展果树很适宜。果树调查资料证明：秦岭北麓现有果树资源极其丰富。果树品种共有二百三十一种。这里有一百五十年生的杏树仍在盛产期，百年以上的柿、栗很普遍，一般成龄的沙果树每株产果达二百到五百斤；葡萄单株棚架产量可达二百市斤，亩产约三千五百斤。这些地区不少农民对培育果树有丰富的经验，多能掌握果树嫁接技术，和各类土地栽植条件。
    勘察队根据秦岭北麓的地势、土壤等自然条件提出，秦岭北麓适宜发展果园的面积有八十一万多亩。
    勘察队在结束勘察工作后，曾邀请西北农学院、西北农业科学研究所的教授、专家座谈，我国著名的园艺学家浙江大学园艺系主任吴耕民教授也参加了这个座谈会。大家一致认为秦岭北麓发展苹果是很适宜的地区。现在勘察队正根据勘察资料和有关机关提出的意见，制定秦岭北麓发展果树的方案。
    陕西省农业厅已经开始培育果苗，预计到第二个五年计划期间，就可开始变秦岭为花果山。
