    A Traveler’s “Entertainment”
    On August 19, several Americans traveled to the Middle East. Throughout their journey, they never stopped their gambling entertainment. Even in the waiting room in London, they were adept at seizing the time, fiddling with their poker cards and banknotes every minute. It is said that gambling is one of the most common "entertainments" for American travelers.

    日本少年的“漫游”
    近来，东京车站出现六百多名少年，他们面容憔悴，无家可归，就徘徊在火车站里不走。据官方说，这些少年是由于煤矿业的萧条而无工作可做，所以才到东京来“漫游”。
