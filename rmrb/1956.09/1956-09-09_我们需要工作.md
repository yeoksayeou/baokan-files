The phenomenon of long-term backlog of cadres in the First Branch of the Design Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building is very serious. Take our own experiences as an example. Most of us graduated in 1953, some even earlier. After graduation, we were assigned to the First Ministry of Machine Building Design Bureau, and later transferred to the First Branch. Our task was to translate foreign designs and materials needed by Soviet experts. The current First Branch was formed by the merger of the original First Branch, Taiyuan Design Office, and East China Civil Engineering Company in March 1955. Therefore, we can only give a comprehensive description of the translation work of these three units before the merger. From July 1953 to March 1955, the original East China Civil Engineering Company had no translation tasks. The original First Branch and the original Taiyuan Design Office translated the preliminary designs of five foreign factories and the preliminary designs of two factories (Chinese to Russian). On average, it would take one person a year to complete the translation work for each factory, which is more than enough. So, the work for seven factories would only require seven people working for one year. However, there were not seven translators in these three units, but more than forty. Calculated in this way, the number of people who completed the above-mentioned translation work only accounted for one-sixth of the total number of people. Of course, in addition to the above main work, there were some odd jobs. Let's assume it took three people one year to complete them, which is not a small amount, right? In addition, in the past, because there was often no work, we sometimes went to support others. In this regard, let's assume that ten people were on business trips for the whole year, which should be enough! Adding all this up, it would only amount to twenty people working for one year. However, from July 1953 to March 1955, we spent a full year and eight months. During one year, only half of the people were working, while half of the people were completely idle; and during the remaining eight months, everyone was "unemployed."

The situation after the merger is also unsatisfactory. With the merger of the three units, the translation team expanded, and the number of people increased to more than sixty. But how much work is there at this time? Let's calculate it again. In the first half of 1955, eighteen people were supporting other units, so there seemed to be fewer people at home. It seemed that we should be busy at this time, right? But in fact, it was still the same, with nothing to do. It was not until the second half of the year that we were really busy for a while. We translated the foreign technical designs of five factories and the materials for going abroad for four factories. But unfortunately, this "prosperity" in work was fleeting, and it was immediately followed by "depression." Even in this half-year that had "prosperity" in work, it only satisfied 50% of the annual workload of translation, which means that half of the time was wasted.

In 1956, the situation deteriorated further, because there were no foreign designs at all at this time. Since there were no foreign designs and no other translation tasks, the phenomenon of idling became even more prominent. So, these written translation staff were dispersed to various sections and assigned to experts. In this way, it seemed that there should be some work, right? No, the serious problem of idling cannot be solved by this simple measure. Because there are very few written translation materials in each section, some sections have almost none, and one oral interpreter is enough for the expert's work, and there is no need for written translation "coordination" at all. Isn't this what happened? When the translators were assigned to various sections, the expert work section kept eight people for themselves. Later, because there was nothing to do in the section, three translators were introduced to the technical section, but the technical section already had five translators. As a result, because there were too many people and not enough work, they were unwilling to keep them. Not long after, the economic budget section wanted to borrow a translator from the technical section, but the comrade in charge of the technical section said, "We don't lend temporarily, or we'll just give you one." Look, to what extent has the translation staff become surplus?! Some sections, seeing that the translators were really idle and uncomfortable, would find some materials that could be translated or not translated for the translators to translate. Some materials were translated but not read, suffering the same fate as the people who translated them, and were "backlogged."

In addition to the First Branch, the translation tasks of the other branches under the bureau are also not many. For example, the Third Branch has more than thirty translators, and they have had no tasks since July of last year.

From the above facts, we can clearly see that here, it is not that there are few people and many things, but that there are many people and few things. However, the leaders of the Design Bureau dare not face this point squarely. They have always emphasized that "the translation work in the future will be very heavy." "The existing number of translators is not enough," and they are unwilling to adjust our work. It is said that the higher authorities once asked the bureau for twenty translators, but the bureau refused to let them go, fearing that they would not be able to get them back after they were released. Therefore, the higher authorities had to ask the Dalian Russian College for twenty students who had not yet graduated. We really don't understand, since there is no work to do here, why are they unwilling to let us go? Other places need people very much, but we are accumulating them here in large numbers. Our motherland is in a high tide of construction, and everyone hopes to do more work, but we are wasting our youth here. We can no longer endure it. We hope that the relevant leading departments will pay attention to this issue and solve it well. Those who should be transferred should be transferred, and those who remain should also be properly arranged so that everyone can have normal work, rather than frequent "unemployment."

    我们需要工作
    晓衡  梦懿
    第一机械工业部设计总局第一分局长期积压干部的现象非常严重，就拿我们自己的遭遇来说吧。我们多半是1953年毕业的，有的还早一些。毕业后被分配到第一机械工业部设计总局，后转第一分局。我们的任务是翻译国外设计和苏联专家需要的资料。现在的一分局是由原一分局、太原设计处和华东土建公司于1955年3月合并起来的。因此，我们对合并前这三个单位的翻译工作只好作综合的叙述。从1953年7月至1955年3月，原华东土建公司无翻译任务，原一分局和原太原设计处共翻译了五个厂的国外初步设计，两个厂的初步设计（中译俄）。每个厂的翻译工作平均一个人花一年的时间足足够了，那么七个厂也只不过用七个人工作一年就够了。但是，这三个单位的翻译不是七个，而是四十多个。这样算来，完成上述几个厂翻译工作的人数，只占全体人数的六分之一。当然，除了上述主要工作外，还有一些零碎的工作，我们算它三个人用一年的时间来完成，这不算少吧？另外，过去因为经常没有工作，所以有时就去支援别人，对此，我们算他十个人整年出差，这也足够了吧！这样总合起来，也不过是二十人只工作了一年。但是由1953年7月到1955年3月，我们整整过了一年零八个月，其中的一年，只有二分之一的人在工作，而二分之一的人完全闲着；而其余的八个月期间，是全体“失业”。
    合并后的情况同样不能令人满意，随着三个单位的合并，翻译的队伍扩大了，人数增加到六十多，但是，这时的工作究竟有多少呢？再让我们来算一算吧。1955年的上半年，有十八个人在外支援其它单位，家里的人也就显得少了一些，这时好像应该忙一下吧？其实不然，照样是无事可作，到了下半年，才算真正忙了一阵，我们翻译了五个厂的国外技术设计和四个厂的出国资料。但可惜的是，这种工作上的“繁荣”，转眼即逝，紧接着又呈现了“萧条”。就在这曾经有过工作“繁荣”的半年里，也只不过满足了翻译全年工作量的50％，也就是说，还有一半的时间是白白地度过的。
    到了1956年，情况就更加恶化了，因为这时根本就没有国外设计。既然没有国外设计，又没有其他翻译任务，这就使窝工现象变得更加突出。于是就把这些笔译翻译分散至各科，配给专家，这样一来，似乎应该有点工作了吧，不，严重的窝工问题决不是用这种简单的措施可以解决的。因为各科的笔译资料很少，有的科几乎没有，而专家工作有一个口译人员也就足够了，根本不需要笔译的“配合”。不就发生这样的事吗？在把翻译分到各科的时候，专家工作科自己留下八人，后因科内无事，有三个翻译介绍到技术科，而技术科已有翻译五人，结果也因人多事少，不愿留用。此后不久，经济预算科想向技术科借用一个翻译，技术科的负责同志却说：“临时借不干，要不，就给你们一个”。请看，翻译人员已过剩到何等地步？！有的科看翻译着实闲得难受，就无事找事地给翻译弄些可译可不译的资料来，有些资料译而不看，跟翻译它的人遭受同样的命运，被“积压”起来了。
    除了第一分局以外，总局所属的其他几个分局的翻译任务也是不多的，如第三分局有三十多个翻译，从去年7月份起，就一直没有任务。
    从上述事实，我们很清楚地可以看出，在我们这里，不是人少事多，而是人多事少。但是，设计总局领导上不敢正视这一点，他们一直强调“今后的翻译工作很重”。“现有翻译人数还不够”，不肯把我们的工作调整一下。据说：上级曾向总局要二十个翻译，总局不放，怕放了以后要不回来，因此上级只好向大连俄专要二十名未毕业的学生。我们真不懂，这里既然没有工作给做，为什么又不肯放呢？别的地方很需要人，而我们这里却在大量积压，我们祖国正处在建设的高潮，每一个人都希望做更多的工作，而我们却在这里浪费青春。我们再也不能忍受了，我们希望有关领导部门重视这一问题，并能很好地加以解决，应该调的就调，留下的也要加以适当的安排，使我们每个人都能有正常的工作，而不是经常的“失业”。
