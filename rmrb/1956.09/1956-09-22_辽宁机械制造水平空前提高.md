Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang Electric Dispatch: Liaoning Province's state-owned machinery industry, in the first three years and eight months of the first five-year plan, produced metal-cutting machine tools equivalent to twenty-three years of production before liberation (calculated using the highest annual output in 1944). If the highest annual output in the past is taken as 100, the output in 1953 was more than 750%, and this year it will be increased to more than 1000%.

In the past, most of the machine tool manufacturing factories in Liaoning Province were limited to repair and assembly, and a few could only manufacture some heavy, ordinary lathes. After several years of transformation, these factories have broken away from backwardness. Not only has the speed of machine tool manufacturing increased unprecedentedly, but also the types of new machine tools have become more and more diverse.

At present, there are fourteen types and twenty-eight specifications of new, high-efficiency machine tools being mass-produced in Liaoning Province. Among them are semi-automatic lathes with automatic feed, retraction, and stopping, multi-tool semi-automatic lathes that can perform pattern cutting and conical cutting, universal milling machines with a maximum speed of 1,500 revolutions controlled by advanced electrical equipment, boring machines with a workbench that can rotate 360 degrees and process workpieces at any angle, mobile radial drilling machines suitable for assembly work, as well as new types of 1Д65 lathes and 1К36 lathes. The 1Д65 lathe manufactured by the Shenyang First Machine Tool Plant is a large-scale automated lathe, weighing seven and a half tons and eighteen feet long. This lathe can be used to cut workpieces that are ten feet long and three feet thick.

Liaoning Province is one of China's important bases for machinery manufacturing. At present, the machine tool manufacturing factories in this province have not only mastered the production technology of various modern machine tools, but also, in recent months, some factories have begun to design new types of machine tools. The Dalian Machine Tool Plant has completed the design of an automated special-purpose combined machine tool. This machine tool has twenty-four spindles and twenty-four tools that can work simultaneously, and its production efficiency far exceeds that of universal boring machines.

The emergence of a large number of new machine tools has provided material and technical conditions for the technical transformation of various industrial sectors. The 1A62 lathe produced by the Shenyang First Machine Tool Plant has supported the technical transformation of 192 units across the country. Many factories in Shanghai, Chongqing, Wuhan and other places have also installed various new machine tools produced by state-owned machine tool manufacturing plants in Liaoning Province.

    辽宁机械制造水平空前提高
    三年又八个月生产的金属切削机床相当解放前最高产量年二十三年产量
    新华社沈阳电　辽宁省国营机械工业，在第一个五年计划的头三年八个月里生产的金属切削机床，相当于解放前二十三年的产量（以1944年最高年产量计算）。如果以过去最高年产量为一百，1953年产量为750％以上，今年更将提高到1000％以上。
    辽宁省过去有的机床制造工厂多限于修配性质，少数只能制造一些笨重的普通车床。这些工厂经过几年的改造，摆脱了落后状态，不仅制造机床的速度空前提高，新型机床的品种也越来越多。
    目前，辽宁省大批生产的新型的高效率的机床就有十四种、二十八个规格。其中有自动进刀、退刀和停车的半自动车床，有可以进行花样切削和锥形切削的多刀半自动车床，有最高转数达一千五百转的用高级电器装置来控制的万能铣床，有工作台可以回转三百六十度的、能加工任何角度工作物的镗床，有适用于装配工作的移动式的摇臂钻床，还有新型的一Д六五车床和一Ｋ三六车床等。沈阳第一机床厂制造的一Д六五车床是一种大型的自动化车床，自重七吨半、长一丈八尺。这种车床可以用来切削一丈长、三尺粗的工作物。
    辽宁省是中国机械制造业重要基地之一。目前，这个省的机床制造工厂不仅掌握了多种近代化机床的生产技术，近几个月来，一些工厂已经开始设计新型机床。大连机床厂已经完成了一种自动化专用组合机床的设计。这种机床有二十四个主轴，二十四把刀可以同时工作，生产效能远远超过万能镗床。
    大批新式机床的产生为各工业部门的技术改造提供了物质技术条件。沈阳第一机床厂生产的一Ａ六二车床就支援了全国一百九十二个单位的技术改造。在上海、重庆和武汉等地的许多工厂也都安装了辽宁省国营机床制造厂生产的各种新型机床。
