Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, September 1st. (Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhou Junqian) reported: Soil and water conservation work in the five provinces (regions) of Shaanxi, Gansu, Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, and Henan in the middle reaches of the Yellow River has greatly developed. The controlled area completed in the first half of this year exceeded the total controlled area completed in the past five years; soil and water conservation work in these areas has shifted from key demonstrations in the past to a stage of comprehensive promotion.

    All five provinces (regions) have carried out large-scale soil and water conservation work in the first half of this year. According to incomplete statistics, the completed projects such as afforestation, silt dam construction, terracing, gully dams, reservoirs, and fish-scale pits can control a total of 37,959 square kilometers (some of which do not belong to the Yellow River basin), which is 72% more than the total controlled area completed in the past five years. These projects have reduced the large amount of sediment flowing into the Yellow River, developed agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry in these areas, and improved people's lives. In areas of Gansu Province that have promoted the Longzhong farming method, the amount of soil and water loss per mu of farmland has been reduced from 24,000 jin before the implementation of this farming method to 4,050 jin; farmland in the upper reaches of the Jing River, a tributary of the Yellow River in the eastern Loess Plateau of Gansu Province, where soil and water conservation field projects have been carried out, can increase grain production by about 100 million jin. The gully dams built in the Wuding River and Yan River basins, tributaries of the Yellow River in northern Shaanxi Province, can reduce the amount of sediment flowing into the Yellow River by 24 million cubic meters annually. The soil berms, terraces, and silt dams built in fifty counties including Baode, Hequ, and Qinyuan in Shanxi Province in the spring have increased the amount of moist land by nearly 420,000 mu.

    The soil and water conservation work carried out at an unprecedented speed and on a grand scale in these areas in the first half of this year has formed a mass movement to conquer nature with great momentum. This upsurge of soil and water conservation was launched under the upsurge of agricultural cooperation and production. It was also generated on the basis of the experience of soil and water conservation work in the past few years and the masses' conscious enthusiasm for supporting the construction of the Yellow River. The arrival of this upsurge has shifted soil and water conservation work from key demonstrations in the past to a stage of comprehensive promotion. At most, 1.5 million male and female farmers in Gansu Province directly participated in soil and water conservation and farmland water conservancy work. Under the slogan of "Men and women work together, no one is idle in every household," half of the women in Suide Special District of Shaanxi Province participated in projects such as repairing terraces and building dams. 100,000 people in Lishan County, Shanxi Province, invested in this movement. In the first half of this year, field projects alone completed in Gansu Province reached 9.7 million mu, which is 154% of the total completed in the past five years; Shaanxi Province afforested 2.16 million mu, which is equal to 188% of the total afforestation in the past five years; Inner Mongolia's annual soil and water conservation task is to control 1,000 square kilometers, and in the first half of the year it overfulfilled the task by reaching 1,267 square kilometers.

    These areas are continuing to strive towards the direction of terracing slopes, canalizing gullies into plains, irrigating plains, and greening barren hills and slopes, in order to realize the plan of conserving soil and water and building mountainous areas, and strive to basically control soil and water loss in the middle reaches of the Yellow River within seven years.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, September 1st. The five-province (region) afforestation inspection meeting of Shaanxi, Gansu, Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, and Henan was held in Taiyuan City for seven days and ended on August 31st. Combining the inspection of spring afforestation, this meeting focused on discussing the specific problems of agricultural cooperatives in afforestation work, and exchanged opinions on continuing to carry out a large-scale autumn afforestation campaign.

    The attendees from various regions believed that agricultural cooperatives should also include forestry in their production plans. The remuneration and labor organization forms for afforestation can be handled according to the principles of rationality and benefit to production. The comprehensive opinion of the meeting on solving the problem of insufficient seeds is that areas with sufficient seed sources should widely mobilize the masses to collect seeds; areas lacking seeds should collect any trees available, try to achieve self-sufficiency from nearby sources; in areas without seeds, the Youth League and forestry departments can organize youth expedition teams to solve the problem in a planned way. The experience of Shanxi Province in relying on and mobilizing agricultural cooperatives to establish nurseries and carry out mass seedling cultivation in ridges and flower pots attracted the attention of the meeting, and the meeting believed that this experience can be widely promoted.

    The meeting discussed the controversial issues of compulsory labor, youth shock brigades, and youth expedition afforestation in the current rural afforestation work. After analyzing the new situation of agricultural cooperatives' development, the participants in the speech proposed that it is not appropriate to organize too much compulsory afforestation in the future. Most people advocated that youth shock afforestation is a better form of afforestation work, and in the future it should be organized under the unified leadership of agricultural cooperatives, with the commune or team as the unit. However, attention should be paid to health, safety and needs, and blind shock should not be carried out. The method of youth expedition teams is not suitable for large-scale organization at present, and the method of gradually greening from near mountains to far mountains, from mountain gullies to mountain tops, and from shady slopes to sunny slopes in Gansu Province should be adopted. The meeting believed that the method of agricultural cooperatives in Zhongning County, Gansu Province, sending expedition teams to the mountains for afforestation and practicing agroforestry is a good experience.

    The meeting studied the autumn afforestation work. It was determined that because the Loess Plateau has more rain in autumn and a higher survival rate, the afforestation work should be carried out on a large scale again on the basis of spring afforestation.

### 争取在七年内将水土基本上控制起来  黄河中游全面推广水土保持工作  秋季造林运动将在黄土高原地区大规模展开

    争取在七年内将水土基本上控制起来
    黄河中游全面推广水土保持工作
    秋季造林运动将在黄土高原地区大规模展开
    新华社郑州1日电　新华社记者周君谦报道：黄河中游地区陕西、甘肃、山西、内蒙、河南五省（区）的水土保持工作已经有很大发展。今年上半年完成的控制面积超过了过去五年完成的控制面积的总和；这些地区的水土保持工作已经由过去的重点示范转上全面推广阶段。
    这五个省（区）在今年上半年都开展了大规模的水土保持工作。已完成的造林、淤地坝、梯田、谷坊、蓄水池、鱼鳞坑等项工程，据不完整的统计，共可控制三万七千九百五十九平方公里（其中有一部分属于非黄河流域），比过去五年完成的控制面积总和还多72％。这些工程，减少了流入黄河的大量泥沙，也发展了这些地区的农业、林业和畜牧业，改善了人民的生活。甘肃省推广了陇作区田耕作法的地区，每亩农田的水土流失量已经由没有实行这种耕作法前的二万四千斤减少到四千零五十斤；甘肃省东部黄土高原黄河支流泾河上游地区做了水土保持田间工程的农田，可以增产粮食一亿斤左右。陕西省北部黄河支流无定河、延河流域兴建的沟壑土坝，使流入黄河的泥沙每年可以减少二千四百万公方。山西省保德、河曲、沁源等五十个县在春季做的土梗、梯田、淤地坝等工程，增加墒地近四十二万亩。
    这些地区今年上半年都以空前速度和壮阔的规模展开的水土保持工作形成声势浩大的向自然进军的群众性运动。这样的水土保持高潮，是在农业合作化高潮、生产高潮下展开的。也是在过去几年水土保持工作经验基础上和群众自觉地支援黄河建设的热情中产生的。这一高潮的到来，使水土保持工作由过去的重点示范转上了全面推广阶段。甘肃省直接参加水土保持及农田水利工作的男女农民最多时达一百五十万人。陕西绥德专区在“男女齐动手，家家无闲人”的口号下，有一半妇女参加了修梯田、打坝埝等工程。山西省离山县投入这一运动的达十万人。今年上半年，甘肃省完成的各项工程中，仅田间工程即达九百七十万亩，为过去五年完成总数的154％；陕西省造林二百一十六万亩，等于过去五年造林总数的188％；内蒙全年水土保持任务是控制一千平方公里，上半年即超额完成到一千二百六十七平方公里。
    这些地区，正继续向坡地梯田化、沟地川台化，川地水利化，荒山荒坡绿化方向努力，以实现保持水土，建设山区的计划，争取在七年内将黄河中游地区的水土基本上控制起来。
    新华社太原1日电　陕西、甘肃、山西、内蒙古、河南五省（区）造林检查会议在太原市进行了七天，8月31日结束。这次会议结合检查春季造林情况，着重讨论了农业社在造林工作中的具体问题，并且交换了继续开展大规模秋季造林运动的意见。
    到会的各地人员认为农业社应该把林业也纳入生产规划中。对造林的报酬和劳动组织形式，可根据合理和对生产有利的原则处理。解决种籽不足的办法，会议的综合意见是种源充足地区广泛发动群众采种；缺种地区应有啥树采啥树，先近后远尽量做到自给；没有种籽的地区，青年团和林业部门可以有计划地组织青年远征队解决。山西省依靠和发动农业社建立苗圃，开展群众性的畦地和花盆育苗的经验引起会议注意，会议认为可以普遍推广这项经验。
    会议讨论了有关当前农村造林工作中争论多端的义务劳动、青年突击队和青年远征造林问题。与会人员在发言中分析了目前农业社发展的新情况后，提出今后不宜过多组织义务造林。多数人主张青年突击造林是造林工作的较好形式，今后应该在农业社统一领导下，以社或队为单位组织。但要照顾到健康安全和需要，不要盲目突击。青年远征队的办法目前还不宜大量组织，应采用甘肃省由近山到远山、由山沟到山头、由阴坡到阳坡逐步绿化的办法。会议认为，甘肃省中宁县由农业社派远征队上山造林，实行农林间作的办法是个好经验。
    会议研究了秋季的造林工作。认定由于黄土高原秋季雨水多、成活率高，应该在春季造林的基础上再次把造林工作大规模地展开。
