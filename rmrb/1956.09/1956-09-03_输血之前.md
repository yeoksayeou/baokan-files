　　The news came from the clinic at lunchtime that the second-year student majoring in metallography, who had been sent to the hospital in the morning, had excessive stomach bleeding. The hospital called, requesting someone be sent immediately to donate blood. The Communist Youth League secretary left the cafeteria and headed straight for the second-year students’ dormitory, still holding the notebook he had taken to the morning meeting.

　　Entering the dormitory, the corridor was silent. At the far end of the corridor, two or three students were discussing something nervously, and one or two others were walking back and forth in a hurry. The secretary, panting, told them the news he had just heard, hoping that someone could go to the clinic immediately to have their blood tested, so that they could find several people with compatible blood types to donate blood to the student. But these students didn't seem to listen to him and were still discussing their own matters in low voices. He looked into a few more rooms but couldn’t find a single person. When he looked back, the three people who had been discussing something were gone. "What should I do?" the secretary was troubled. "This kind of thing can't be forced. What's needed is blood, not something else." The secretary looked around at both ends of the corridor again and ran helplessly to the clinic: "Maybe my own blood is suitable for transfusion?"

　　As he approached the clinic, he saw groups of college students also running in that direction. The secretary's mind started racing again: "Are they all here to have their blood types tested? Or has something else happened?" He quickened his pace.

　　The clinic corridor was crowded with college students. Although he couldn't name them all, the secretary recognized familiar faces, including not only those majoring in metallography but also those from other majors and departments, not only those in the second year but also those in other years. After finally squeezing through the corridor to enter the laboratory, the secretary smiled with relief. From the quiet conversations, the secretary learned that the college students had come for the same purpose as him: "To donate their blood to the student with excessive bleeding."

　　The lab technician told the secretary that the blood testing would take a long time, and only a few people needed to wait here to have their blood tested. Otherwise, everyone would be waiting here in vain, which would not only hinder the work of the clinic but also affect the students' lunch break. The secretary came out and told the students this, but unexpectedly, he encountered another difficulty: no matter how he explained it, it had no effect, and not a single student was willing to leave.

　　The secretary stared blankly at this group of "stubborn" young people, wondering how to persuade them to go back. At the same time, he recalled his own student days before liberation. A faint smile appeared on his tightly furrowed brow.

    输血之前
  　高学熔
    午饭时从卫生室里传来了消息，说上午被送到医院去的金相专业二年级的那个同学，胃部出血过多，医院里打电话叫立刻派人去给她输血。团委书记走出了食堂直向二年级同学的宿舍跑去，手里还拿着上午开会时拿的一本笔记本。
    走进宿舍，走廊里一片寂静。走廊的那一头，有两三个同学紧张地商量着什么，还有一两个匆忙地来回走着。书记气喘吁吁地把刚才听到的消息告诉他们，希望有人能马上去卫生室验血，以便找几个血型合宜的去给那个同学输血。可是这些同学好像都没听他的话，仍在低声商量着自己的事情。他再向几个房间里看看，竟没有一个人。回过头看时，那三个原在商谈什么的人也没有了。“怎么办呢？”书记为难起来，“这样的事又勉强不得。要输的是血，又不是别的东西。”书记又向走廊两头张望一下，无可奈何地跑向卫生室去了：“也许我自己的血是可以输的呢？”
    快走到卫生室的时候，看见三三两两的大学生们也向这个方向跑来，书记心里又打起转来：“他们也都是来验血型的吗？还是又出了别的什么事了呢？”他更加快了脚步。
    卫生室的走廊里挤满了大学生，虽不能全说出他们的姓名，可是从熟悉的面孔上，书记认出他们不仅有金相专业的，还有其他专业和科系的，不仅有二年级的，还有其他年级的。好容易穿过走廊，要走进化验室的时候，书记轻松地笑了。从那些悄悄的谈话中，书记知道了大学生是为了和他同样的目的而来的：“要把自己的血送给那个出血过多的同学。”
    化验员告诉书记说：化验工作很慢，只要有几个人在这儿等着验血就可以了，不然大家都白白地等在这里，既妨碍卫生室的工作，又影响同学们午休。书记走出来把这个情况告诉同学们，没想到又遇到了难事：这样解释，那样解释，都没有效果，没有一个同学愿意离开。
    书记一面呆看着这群“固执”的青年，心里盘算着如何把他们劝回去；一面回忆着解放前自己做学生的那个时代，在他那紧锁着眉头的面孔上，出现了微微的笑容。
