Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 10th – The CCP grassroots organizations in rural areas of Shanxi Province have grown and consolidated as a result of their development during the cooperative movement and the recent two party rectifications. Currently, the CCP grassroots organizations in rural areas throughout the province have more than 300,000 party members.

Based on the strong desire of a large number of peasant activists who emerged during the upsurge of cooperativization in the winter of last year to join the Party, Party organizations in various regions have universally strengthened Party building work. Many regional Party organizations paid attention to selecting and cultivating development targets during the cooperative movement. After the movement, they systematically conducted education on Party knowledge, and paid special attention to carrying out Party building work in townships and cooperatives with weak foundations, as well as among intellectuals, handicraft workers, and employees of private industrial and commercial stores in the countryside. As a result, the Party organization has developed rapidly this year and the quality is relatively good. According to the Organization Department of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, among the approximately 10,000 new party members developed in the first half of the year, 70% to 80% were leading backbones of agricultural cooperatives or various advanced elements.

While actively and cautiously developing new party members, party organizations in various places also carried out two to three organizational and ideological rectifications. During the rectification process, the original party organizations were adjusted, changing from village-based units to township-based general branches and agricultural cooperative-based branches. At the same time, the Party's leadership over agricultural cooperatives was also focused on inspecting and improving. In the ideological rectification, the focus was on criticizing the complacency and relaxation of leadership over agricultural cooperatives that emerged among some party members and cadres after the realization of advanced cooperativization. After the rectification, leading cadres of party organizations were re-elected, and the systems of collective leadership and inner-party democracy were improved, making the party organizations purer and more consolidated.

After more than half a year of development and comprehensive rectification, the rural Party organizations in Shanxi Province have gradually formed a strong leading core in the countryside. Most of the province's 16,700-plus branches, except for those with fewer party members, have been established in agricultural cooperatives, gradually strengthening the Party's leadership over cooperative production. Many of the more than 300,000 party members scattered throughout the province's rural areas have served as leading cadres of agricultural cooperatives, and they have played a leading and exemplary role in the cooperative movement; in subsequent rectification and development activities, they have been selected by members as models of active labor and care for public property.

    经过合作化运动中的发展和两次整党
    山西农村党组织成为坚强领导核心
    新华社太原10日电　山西省各地农村中的中共基层组织，经过在合作化运动中的发展和最近两次整党，日益壮大和巩固了。目前全省农村中的中共基层组织已拥有三十多万名党员。
    各地党组织根据去年冬季合作化大发展运动中涌现的大批农民积极分子迫切要求入党的情况，普遍加强了建党工作。许多地区党组织在合作化运动中注意选择和培养发展对象，运动结束后，又系统地进行了有关党的知识的教育，并且特别注意在基础薄弱的乡、社和在乡知识分子、手工业工人，以及私营工商业店员中进行建党工作。因此，使今年党组织发展进度快，质量较好。据中共山西省委组织部统计，全省在上半年发展的约一万名新党员中，有70％到80％是农业社领导骨干或各种先进分子。
    在积极慎重发展新党员的同时，各地党组织还进行了两次到三次的组织和思想整顿。在整顿过程中，把原来党组织作了调整，由以村为单位改为以乡为单位建立总支、以农业社为单位建立分支，同时还着重检查和改进了党对农业社的领导。在思想整顿中，集中批判了某些党员干部在实现高级合作化以后产生的自满情绪和放松对农业社领导的错误作法。整顿结束后，还改选了党组织的领导干部，健全了集体领导和党内民主制度，使党组织更加纯洁和巩固。
    经过半年多来的发展和全面整顿，山西省农村党组织已逐渐形成农村中坚强的领导核心。全省一万六千七百多个支部中除党员较少的以外，全部分别建立在农业社，逐步加强了党对合作社的生产领导。散布在全省农村中的三十多万名党员，很多担任了农业社领导干部，他们在合作化运动中起了带头和示范作用；在以后的整社和发展生产活动中又被社员选为积极劳动、爱护公共财产的模范。
