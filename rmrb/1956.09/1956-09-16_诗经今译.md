The Book of Songs in Modern Translation

Wall With Thorns (Yong Feng)

    This is a satirical poem. Legend says that after Duke Xuan of Wei died, his son Duke Hui succeeded him. Duke Hui was young, and Duke Xuan's illegitimate son, Gongzi Wan, had an affair with Duke Hui's mother, Xuan Jiang, and had five children, three sons and two daughters. These aristocratic lords spoke of the principles of ethics and morality, but their actions were like those of beasts. The people of Wei could not stand it, so they composed this song to satirize them.

    Thorns grow on the wall,
    You can't sweep them away;
    Words in the private chamber,
    You can't speak them out;
    If you speak them out,
    They are truly ugly.
    Thorns grow on the wall,
    You can't remove them all;
    Words in the private chamber,
    You can't explain them in detail;
    If you explain them in detail,
    The story is long.
    Thorns grow on the wall,
    You can't get rid of them;
    Words in the private chamber,
    You can't shout them out;
    If you shout them out,
    It's truly shameful.

Original Text: 墙有茨，不可埽也。中冓之言，不可道也。所可道也，言之丑也。墙有茨，不可襄也。中冓之言，不可详也。所可详也，言之长也。墙有茨，不可束也。中冓之言，不可读也。所可读也，言之辱也。

    “中冓” (zhong gou), the meaning is not clear. Old interpretations take it to mean palace, boudoir, or midnight. In any case, "words in the private chamber" means private or hidden words. The "long" in "言之长也" (yan zhi chang ye) was interpreted in the old style as "the ugliness is long," so this sentence can also be translated as: "Speaking of it is truly dirty!" But translating it literally, the semantic meaning before and after is also coherent, or perhaps even more appropriate.

Following the Main Road (Zheng Feng)

    A song sung by a woman when a man goes out and is about to travel far away. It is very similar to the "Walking to the West" folk song of modern times, but it seems simpler, purer, more sincere, and deeper than "Walking to the West."

    Looking ahead along the main road,
    I grab hold of your robe,
    Don't be disgusted with me,
    Old affection can't be broken.
    Looking ahead along the main road,
    I grab hold of your hand,
    Don't dislike me for being ugly,
    Love can't be lost.

Original Text: 遵大路兮，掺执子之袪兮，无我恶兮，不寁故也。遵大路兮，掺执子之手兮，无我魗兮，不寁好也。

Climbing Mount Gu (Wei Feng)

    Climbing that bare mountain,
    Gazing afar at my father,
    My father says: "Alas!
    My son is on duty,
    Never resting day and night;
    You must be careful!
    Be sure to come back, don't stay away."
    Climbing that grassy mountain,
    Gazing afar at my mother,
    My mother says: "Alas!
    My youngest son is on duty,
    Never getting sleep day and night;
    You must be careful!
    Be sure to come back, don't be left behind."
    Climbing that mountain ridge,
    Gazing afar at my older brother,
    My older brother says: "Alas!
    My younger brother is on duty,
    Always keeping up with the team day and night;
    You must be careful!
    Be sure to come back, don't die away from home."

Original Text: 陟彼岵兮，瞻望父兮，父曰：“嗟！予子行役，夙夜无已；上慎旃哉！犹来无止。”陟彼岵兮，瞻望母兮，母曰：“嗟！予季行役，夙夜无寐；上慎旃哉！犹来无弃。”陟彼冈兮，瞻望兄兮，兄曰：“嗟！予弟行役，夙夜必偕；上慎旃哉，犹来无死。”

    墙有茨（鄘风）
    这是一首讽刺诗。相传卫宣公死后，其子惠公继位。惠公年幼，宣公庶子公子顽与惠公之母宣姜相通，生子五人，三男二女。这些贵族领主，口讲纲常伦理，实际行同禽兽。卫国人民看不过去，所以编了这么一个歌来讽刺他们。
    墙头上长蒺藜，
    扫也扫不走呀；
    私房里的话，
    说也说不出口呀，
    要是说出口呀，
    说起来实在丑呀。
    墙头上长蒺藜，
    除也除不光呀；
    私房里的话，
    不能讲端详呀，
    要是讲端详呀，
    讲起来话儿长呀。
    墙头上的蒺藜，
    去也去不掉呀；
    私房里的话，
    不能乱嚷叫呀，
    要是乱嚷叫呀，
    嚷出去真害臊呀。原文：墙有茨，不可埽也。中冓之言，不可道也。所可道也，言之丑也。墙有茨，不可襄也。中冓之言，不可详也。所可详也，言之长也。墙有茨，不可束也。中冓之言，不可读也。所可读也，言之辱也。
    “中冓”，义不详，旧法解作宫中、闺中或中夜，总之，“中冓之言”就是阴私之言的意思。“言之长也”的“长”旧法解作：“恶长也”，所以这一句也可以译作：“讲起来实在脏呀！”而照字面直译，前后语义亦通，甚或是更恰当些。
    遵大路（郑风）
    男子外出，将有远行，女子送别时唱的歌。很像近代“走西口”一类小调，但比“走西口”似更单纯，醇朴，真挚，深厚。
    顺着大路往前看啊，
    一把拉住郎衣衫啊，
    不要把我厌啊，
    旧情不能断呀。
    顺着大路往前瞅啊，
    一把拉住郎的手啊，
    不要嫌我丑啊，
    恩爱不能丢呀。原文：遵大路兮，掺执子之袪兮，无我恶兮，不寁故也。遵大路兮，掺执子之手兮，无我魗兮，不寁好也。
    陟　岵（魏风）
    登到那秃山上呵，
    遥把父亲望呵，
    父亲说：“咳！
    我的儿子出劳役，
    早晚没休息；
    千万要小心呀！
    务必回来可别留在外地。”
    登到那草山上呵，
    遥把母亲望呵，
    母亲说：“咳！
    我的小三出劳役，
    早晚不得睡；
    千万要小心呀，
    务必回来可别扔在外地。”
    登到那山岗上呵，
    遥把哥哥望呵，
    哥哥说：“咳！
    我的弟弟出劳役，
    早晚要跟上队；
    千万要小心呀，
    务必回来可别死在外地。”原文：陟彼岵兮，瞻望父兮，父曰：“嗟！予子行役，夙夜无已；上慎旃哉！犹来无止。”陟彼岵兮，瞻望母兮，母曰：“嗟！予季行役，夙夜无寐；上慎旃哉！犹来无弃。”陟彼冈兮，瞻望兄兮，兄曰：“嗟！予弟行役，夙夜必偕；上慎旃哉，犹来无死。”
