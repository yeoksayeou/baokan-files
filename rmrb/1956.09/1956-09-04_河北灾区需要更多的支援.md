Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, September 2nd. Hebei Province’s production and disaster relief has received much support from other areas. After some counties in the Tianjin and Tongxian Special Zones were flooded, Beijing and Tianjin promptly transferred large quantities of grain to supply the disaster-stricken people. The two cities and the Beijing Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army also organized comfort groups and medical teams, carrying large amounts of food, relief funds, and medicines, to visit the disaster areas in Hebei Province, express their condolences to the victims, and treat their illnesses. Units in Wuhan, Xi'an, Baotou, Datong, and Heilongjiang Province also sold more than 12 million catties of bran, rice sugar, and other substitute foods and feed to the Baoding Special Zone of Hebei Province. Baotou also signed a batch of sideline product sales contracts with the special zone to help disaster-stricken people in Hebei sell sideline products.

At present, various production and self-help activities in the disaster areas of Hebei Province have gradually begun. The central government has provided strong support for raw materials such as cotton and flax needed by disaster victims for textile, mat weaving, fishing, vermicelli and other sideline production. However, due to the severity of the disaster, the large affected area, and the limited purchasing power of the people in the province, there are still many difficulties in selling sideline products in the disaster area. At the same time, due to the excessive flooding, the raw materials used for some sideline businesses, such as reeds, have also suffered reduced harvests due to the disaster. Therefore, there are still many difficulties in the province's production and disaster relief work.

The leading organs of production and disaster relief in Hebei Province have comprehensively studied these difficult problems at the recent provincial production and disaster relief and autumn harvest distribution meeting, and have studied solutions based on the spirit of self-reliance. However, due to the particularly severe disaster, some difficulties cannot be completely resolved by ourselves. Therefore, the commercial and labor departments of Hebei Province are planning to send cadres to relevant provinces and cities to contact and negotiate in order to obtain more support from various provinces and cities.

    河北灾区需要更多的支援
    新华社保定2日电　河北省的生产救灾得到了外地许多支援。天津和通县专区有些县洪水成灾后，北京、天津两市曾及时调运大批粮食供应灾区人民吃用。这两个市和中国人民解放军北京军区，还先后组织慰问团、医疗队，携带大批食物、慰问款和医药品，深入河北省各个灾区向灾民进行慰问，并给灾民治疗疾病。武汉、西安、包头、大同及黑龙江省的一些单位，也卖给了河北省保定专区一千二百多万斤麸子、米糖等代食品和饲料。包头市还与这个专区签订了一批副业产品销售合同，帮助河北灾民推销副业产品。
    现在，河北省灾区的各种生产自救活动已经逐步展开。灾民进行纺织、织席、捕鱼、粉条等副业生产所需用的棉花、棉纱、麻等原料，中央已给予大力支援。但是，由于灾情严重，受灾面大，本省人民购买力有限，灾区副业产品销售还有许多困难。同时由于洪水过大，一些开展副业所用的原料如芦苇等也因灾减收，因此，这个省的生产救灾工作，还有许多的困难。
    河北省生产救灾的领导机关，已将这些困难问题在最近召开的全省生产救灾、秋收分配会议上作了通盘研究，并且根据自力更生的精神，研究了解决的办法。但是由于灾情特别严重，有些困难自己还不能完全解决，因此河北省商业、劳动等部门，正计划派出干部到有关省、市联系协商，以取得各省、市更多的支援。
