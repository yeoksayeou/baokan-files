Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, September 5th: Yu Jie, Deputy Governor of Heilongjiang Province and Director of the Rural Work Department of the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, told Xinhua reporters: "This year, although one-tenth of Heilongjiang Province's farmland has suffered from floods, if there are no early frost disasters in the twenty-odd days before the autumn harvest, the total grain output may reach about nine million tons, which will exceed last year by about 800,000 tons."

Yu Jie's estimate was made at a meeting of rural work directors of various cities and counties convened by the Provincial Party Committee's Rural Work Department, based on reports from various counties.

Of the approximately 700,000 hectares of farmland in Heilongjiang Province that suffered from floods, 400,000 hectares still have varying degrees of harvest after farmers' rescue and strengthened field management. In non-disaster areas, the crops in most areas are growing better than last year. The famous Heilongjiang soybeans are already bearing pods, and rice, a new crop in Heilongjiang Province, is already filling and about to mature, and a bumper harvest is expected. Only potatoes and other vegetables have a poorer harvest than last year due to excessive water.

Heilongjiang Province will be able to obtain such a good harvest under severe flood conditions mainly because, after the realization of advanced agricultural cooperation, farmers' enthusiasm for production has been unprecedentedly high, and all agricultural cooperatives have strengthened field management work. Various measures to increase production have also been taken. For example, the area of fertilization has increased by 10% compared to last year; the area of flat-sown grains using new-style animal-powered farm tools, which play a significant role in increasing production, has doubled compared to last year, and more than 400,000 hectares of new wasteland have been reclaimed and planted this year, and more than 120,000 hectares of rice fields have been expanded.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, September 4th: Late autumn crops are growing well in various parts of Zhejiang Province. Currently, more than 17 million mu of late rice is in the peak period of development. Among them, more than 6 million mu of continuous cropping late rice, most of which was transplanted around the time of the typhoon on August 2nd, is now developing tillers and showing a new green color; only a small portion of paddy fields that were affected by the typhoon or drought and transplanted after the beginning of autumn are just beginning to turn green. In addition, about 810,000 mu of continuous cropping rice fields have been or are being converted to autumn miscellaneous grains or feed crops, and about 230,000 mu of rice fields cannot be planted this year due to seawater erosion.

The province's ramie has now grown to more than a person's height. The more than 600,000 mu of ramie that had been hit by the typhoon is still growing normally after being supported, and can be harvested in about a week; only a very small number of ramie fields have suffered relatively large losses due to typhoons and floods, and have been replanted with other crops.

The province's cotton is in the budding season, and some areas in eastern Zhejiang have already begun to harvest.

According to estimates by Zhejiang Province's agricultural departments, although the province's late autumn crops have been affected by natural disasters such as water, drought, and typhoons, there are still many favorable conditions that can be used to strive for increased late-season production. Especially this year, spring flowers have already achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest, and the total output of early rice has increased by more than double compared to last year. Even if there are some small disasters in the autumn, the total annual grain output can still increase compared to last year. In order to strive for increased late-season production, agricultural cooperative members throughout Zhejiang Province are currently strengthening field management work.

Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, September 3rd: The countryside of Yunnan Province is showing a scene of bumper harvest, and it is expected that grain crops can increase by 20% compared to last year. Now, farmers of all ethnic groups are actively preparing for the harvest. According to recent surveys: the average rice yield can increase by more than 20% compared to last year, and the Wenshan Special District, which has the largest increase in production, is expected to increase by 31%. Miscellaneous grains can also generally increase in production, and in the Zhaotong Special District, the main producing area of miscellaneous grains, corn can increase by 21% compared to last year. Currently, rice has begun to be harvested in some areas.

The main reasons for this year's bumper grain harvest are: after the basic cooperation of the province, the enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers for production has been unprecedentedly high. Large-scale agricultural infrastructure construction has been carried out, a large number of farmland water conservancy projects have been built, the area of rice has been expanded, more than 2 million mu of wasteland have been reclaimed, fertilizers have been increased, and advanced experiences and advanced cultivation techniques have been promoted in accordance with local conditions and time. It is because of these measures that the increase in grain crop production has been guaranteed.

### 黑龙江和浙江灾后加强田间管理工作  粮食总产量仍可超过去年  云南省粮食作物将比去年增产二成

    黑龙江和浙江灾后加强田间管理工作
    粮食总产量仍可超过去年
    云南省粮食作物将比去年增产二成
    新华社哈尔滨5日电　黑龙江省副省长、中共黑龙江省委员会农村工作部部长于杰对新华社记者说：“今年，黑龙江省的农田虽然有十分之一遭受了水灾，但是，如果在秋收前的二十多天中没有早霜冻灾，粮食总产量可能达到九百万吨左右，将要超过去年八十万吨。”
    于杰的这个估计是在省委农村工作部召开的各市、县农村工作部长会议上，根据各县的汇报作出的。
    黑龙江省遭受水灾的七十万左右公顷农田，经农民抢救和加强田间管理，有四十万公顷还有程度不同的收成。在非灾区，绝大多数地区的农作物比去年长的好。著名的黑龙江省大豆，已经结荚累累，在黑龙江省还是新兴的作物——水稻，已经灌浆即将成熟，可望丰收。只有马铃薯和其他菜类，因水多，收成不如去年。
    黑龙江省在严重的水灾情况下，将能获得这样好的收成，主要是实现了高级农业合作化以后，农民生产情绪空前高涨，各个农业社都加强了田间管理工作。并且采取了多种增产措施。比如施肥面积就比去年增加了10％；对增产有重大作用的用新式畜力农具，平播的谷物面积比去年增加了一倍，今年新开荒扩大播种面积四十多万公顷，扩大稻田十二多万公顷。
    据新华社杭州4日电　浙江省各地晚秋作物生长情况良好。目前，一千七百多万亩晚稻正当发育旺期。其中六百多万亩连作晚稻，大部是在8月2日台风侵袭前后插秧的，现在已经发棵分蘖，泛出一片新绿；只有小部分受台风或天旱影响延至立秋以后插秧的稻田，目前才开始转青。另外，约有八十一万亩连作稻田已经或正在改种秋季杂粮或饲料作物，约有二十三万亩左右稻田今年由于海水冲蚀不能种植作物。
    全省络麻现在已长到一人多高了，曾遭受台风侵袭的六十多万亩络麻在扶植起来后生长仍较正常，大约再过一星期左右就可开始收割；只有极少数络麻田因为受台风和洪水侵害损失较大，已改种其他作物。
    全省棉花正当长蕾季节，浙东有些地区已经开始收摘。
    据浙江省农业部门估计，今年全省各地晚秋作物虽然受到水、旱、台风等自然灾害的影响，但仍有很多有利条件可以争取晚造增产。特别是在今年春花已经获得空前丰收，早稻总产量比去年增产一倍以上的情况下，即使秋季再有一些小的灾害，全年粮食总产量仍可比去年增加。为争取晚造增产，目前浙江全省农业社社员正在加强田间管理工作。
    新华社昆明3日电　云南省农村呈现着一片丰收景象，预计粮食作物能比去年增产二成。现在，各族农民积极准备收获。根据最近的调查：稻谷平均能比去年增产二成以上，增产最多的文山专区预计可增产31％。杂粮也能普遍增产，杂粮主要产地昭通专区，玉米能比去年增产21％。目前部分地区的水稻已开始收割。
    今年粮食获得丰收的主要原因是：全省基本合作化之后，广大农民生产积极性空前高涨。进行了大规模的农业基本建设，兴修了大量的农田水利，扩大了水稻面积，开垦了二百多万亩荒地，增施了肥料，因地制宜、因时制宜地推广了先进经验和先进耕作技术。由于采取了这些措施，才保证了粮食作物的增产。
