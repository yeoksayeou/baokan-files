    New Developments in Photosynthesis Research
    Yin Hongzhang

    Photosynthesis is one of the most fundamental problems in biology. Green plants use the power of sunlight to transform inhaled carbon dioxide and water into complex organic matter, which is used to supply their own nutrition and growth; these organic substances can also be used as food for all animals (including humans). As far as humans are concerned, not only does food come directly or indirectly from plants, but the power used is also a product of past plants, all of which has been accumulated through photosynthesis.

    Great achievements have been made in determining the chemical steps of photosynthesis, due to the use of tracer atoms. Soviet scientists have proved that carbon dioxide can be absorbed by the roots and then transported to the leaves; moreover, photosynthesis not only produces sugars, but also proteins and fats. American scientists have thoroughly analyzed the intermediate products of photosynthesis, how carbon dioxide is fixed, how it is transformed, and how it is reduced. By now, a series of very complex changes in photosynthesis have been almost clarified, and the related enzyme systems have been gradually separated, and each step can be simulated separately in vitro. The relationship between photosynthesis, respiration, and other metabolic processes has also gradually become clear.

    Another achievement is the performance of in vitro photosynthesis. In 1940, the British scientist Hill discovered that chloroplasts taken out of cells could also perform some photochemical reactions. This reaction is called the Hill reaction. After research by many scientists, it is now possible to link this reaction with the reduction of carbon dioxide, so that the entire photosynthesis can be carried out in vitro using chloroplasts. Recent studies have shown that not only whole chloroplasts, but even ground chloroplast fragments, can perform the Hill reaction to a certain extent. However, so far we have not been able to use extracted pure chlorophyll, plus appropriate cofactors and enzymes, to carry out photosynthesis. It is expected that in the near future, it may be possible to use preparations of some pure compounds entirely in vitro to carry out artificial photosynthesis.

    Performing artificial photosynthesis in vitro will be a great achievement in science. But this does not mean that we will not cultivate plants, and we can simply build some photosynthesis factories to supply us with all the food and raw materials we need. Because although artificial photosynthesis can be carried out in the laboratory, it costs a lot and the quantity is very small, far less economical than plants. What's more, the plant products we want are diverse, and we don't yet know their synthesis processes.

    Before mass-producing artificial photosynthesis, there is another way worth considering: that is, using some lower plants to replace some crops. From the perspective of photosynthesis, the efficiency of higher plants in utilizing solar energy is very low. Although we cultivate new varieties, improve cultivation methods, and prevent diseases and insect pests, these are all external tasks, which only increase the area for absorbing sunlight, and do not touch on photosynthesis itself or improve its efficiency. Over the past few decades, scientific research has discovered that not only higher plants can use sunlight to produce organic matter, but also many microorganisms, such as algae and bacteria, also have photosynthesis, and the efficiency is higher, because they grow quickly, and the whole can carry out photosynthesis, unlike higher plants which only have it in the green parts, and the roots, stems, etc. cannot produce. Therefore, in recent years, many countries have conducted research on the mass cultivation of micro-plants, especially Chlorella. Compared with higher plants, microorganisms have several advantages: First, they grow quickly. If the environment is suitable, they can grow forever, unlike higher plants which have a certain period. In the early stage, the leaves are few and cannot fully utilize sunlight to accumulate food; second, their nutritional components are similar to those of higher plant products, and it is easy to use environmental changes to control their content ratio to increase or decrease proteins and fats; third, they grow in water, are easy to manage, and can avoid the impact of natural disasters. In the future, if we can use atomic energy to replace sunlight, and the entire production is carried out in factories, and we no longer "rely on the sky for food," it is not absolutely impossible.

    光合作用研究的新发展
    殷宏章
    光合作用是生物学中最基本的问题之一。绿色植物利用太阳光的能力，把吸进去的二氧化碳和水转化成复杂的有机物，用来供给自身的营养和生长；这些有机物也可充作一切动物（包括人类）的食料。就人类来说，不仅食物直接或间接来自植物，所用的动力也是过去植物的产物，这些都是靠着光合作用积累起来的。
    在光合作用的化学步骤的测定上，由于利用了示踪原子，得到很大的成绩。苏联的科学家证明了二氧化碳可以由根部吸入，而后再输送到叶中去；而且光合作用不仅产生醣类，还产生蛋白质和脂肪。美国的科学工作者详尽地分析了光合作用的中间产物，二氧化碳如何固定，如何转变，如何还原。到现在，光合作用中的一系列很复杂的变化，差不多已经都搞清楚了，有关的酶系统也逐渐地分离出来，各个步骤都可以在体外分别模仿进行。光合作用和呼吸作用及其它的代谢过程的关系，也都逐渐明白了。
    另一方面的成就，是在细胞外进行离体光合作用。1940年英国人希尔发现了从细胞中取出来的叶绿体，也可以进行一些光化学反应。这个反应，叫作希尔反应。经过许多科学家的研究，现在已经可以把这个反应和二氧化碳的还原作用联接起来，使整个的光合作用可以在体外用叶绿体来进行。近年来的研究证明，不仅是整个的叶绿体，即使是磨碎的叶绿体碎片，在一定限度内也可以进行希尔反应。不过，到现在我们还不能够用提取出来的纯粹的叶绿素，加上适当的辅助物和酶来进行光合作用。预料不久将来，可能完全在体外用一些纯化合物的制剂，来进行人工光合作用。
    在植物体外进行人工光合作用，在科学上将是一个很大的成就。但这并不是说，我们不去培育植物，只要建立一些光合作用工厂，就可以供给我们所需要的一切食物和原料。因为尽管在试验室里能进行人工光合作用，但是花费极大，数量很少，远不如植物经济。何况我们所要的植物产物是多种多样的，它们的合成过程，我们还不知道。
    在大量进行人工光合作用以前，还有一个途径值得我们考虑：这就是利用一些低等植物，代替一部分农作物。从光合作用的角度看来，高等植物利用太阳光能的效率是很低的，尽管我们培育新品种，改进栽培方法，防止病害，但都还是外面的工作，只是增加了吸收阳光的面积，并没有接触到光合作用本身，提高它的效率。几十年来科学研究发现了不只是高等植物能用阳光产生有机物，很多的微生物，如水藻细菌也有光合作用，而且效率较高，因为他们生长得快，并且整体全可以进行光合作用，不像高等植物只是绿色部分才有，根、干等部分并不能生产，因此近几年来很多的国家，对于大量培养微生植物，特别是小球藻进行了研究。比起高等植物来，微生物有几种好处：一、它们生长得快，如果环境适宜，可以永远生长，不像高等植物有一定时期，初期叶子少不能充分利用阳光来累积食物；二、它们的营养成份和高等植物产品差不多，而且容易利用环境变化，控制它们的含量比例，使蛋白质式脂肪增加或减少；三、它们生长在水里，容易管理，可以避免天然灾害的影响。将来如果再能利用原子能代替阳光，整个生产在工厂里进行，不再“靠天吃饭”，并不是绝对不可能的事了。
