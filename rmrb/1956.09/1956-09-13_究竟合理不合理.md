    Is it Really Reasonable?
　　Xielin
    The China Silk Company has a system: "All employees who borrow furniture or need housing are primarily considered based on the male employee's situation, completely disregarding the female employee." Many people have pointed out: "This system is unreasonable." However, Jiang Bin, the former administrative section chief of the company, said: "It is reasonable" because "male employees have higher positions than female employees," therefore, "prioritizing the male employee" is perfectly justified.

    This system has caused many inconveniences for the female comrades in the company, especially those whose spouses do not work at the company, making their situations even more difficult. Last year, a female comrade in the company was about to give birth and requested housing allocation from Jiang Bin, but Jiang Bin said: "Your spouse is not here, and we cannot break the system," and therefore refused to allocate housing to her.

    The Constitution of the People's Republic of China stipulates: "Women in the People's Republic of China enjoy equal rights with men in all spheres of political, economic, cultural, social and family life." However, why does the China Silk Company create this artificial inequality between male and female employees? Moreover, after formulating this system that openly discriminates against female comrades, they use "the system" as an excuse to refuse to solve all the special difficulties of female comrades. "Is this really reasonable?" Readers will naturally understand in their hearts.

    究竟合理不合理
　　谢林
    中国丝绸公司有这样一个制度：“凡职工借家具，要房子，一律以男方为主，对女方一概不管”，许多人提出：“这个制度不合理”，但是，该公司前行政处处长江滨同志却说：“合理”，因为“男职工比女职工职位高”，所以，“以男方为主”，是天经地义的。
    这个制度给该公司女同志带来许多不便，尤其那些爱人不在本公司工作的女同志更加狼狈。去年，该公司有一位女同志要生孩子，也是向这位江滨同志要求分配房子，但是，江滨同志说：“你爱人不在这里，不能破坏制度”，因而，拒绝分配房子给她。
    中华人民共和国宪法中规定：“中华人民共和国妇女在政治的、经济的、文化的、社会的和家庭的生活各方面享有同男子平等的权利”，但是，中国丝绸公司为什么要在男女职工中制造这种人为的不平等？而且在制定了这种公开歧视女同志的制度以后，又借口“制度”拒绝解决女同志的一切特殊困难，“这究竟合理不合理”？读者同志心里自然明白。
