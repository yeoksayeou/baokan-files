Xinhua News Agency, September 29th: Beijing workers held a rally tonight to welcome the workers' delegation from Arab countries who are visiting our country at invitation.

When the head of the Arab countries' workers delegation, Sobi Ghattas, deputy head Fathi Kamel, and other sixteen members entered the venue, all two thousand plus workers stood up and applauded to welcome them.

Wang Jiong, chairman of the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions, paid tribute to the Arab people who are engaged in the anti-colonialist struggle when he delivered a welcome speech on behalf of all the workers in Beijing. He said that all the workers in Beijing, together with the entire Chinese people, fully support the Egyptian people's just struggle to nationalize the Suez Canal Company.

Lai Ruoyu, chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, welcomed the arrival of the Arab workers' representatives on behalf of the national workers at the meeting. He said: "We Chinese workers have always regarded the workers of Arab countries as dear brothers. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions has always advocated the establishment and development of friendly relations with trade unions of other countries on the basis of equality, voluntariness and mutual respect. Today, the arrival of the delegation of trade unions from Arab countries will greatly promote the friendly ties between the Chinese trade unions and Arab trade unions."

The deputy head of the Arab countries' workers delegation, Secretary-General of the Arab Trade Union Federation, and Secretary-General of the Egyptian Trade Union Congress, Fathi Kamel, said in his speech that the Arab people have long been watching the victory of the Chinese people's liberation struggle. We believe that the liberation of the Chinese people is a precursor to the liberation of Arab countries and the weak nations of the world. The Arab people thank the Chinese workers, people and government for their support of Egypt's struggle to recover the Suez Canal Company. We hope that the friendship between the Arab people and the Chinese people will continue to be consolidated and developed.

The China Railway Art Troupe performed songs, dances and acrobatics for the guests.
