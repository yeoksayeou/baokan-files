Title: The "Qualifications" for Criticism

    Criticism needs "qualifications"? It is said that it does.
    For example, someone who has been criticized, even though they have already corrected their mistakes, or are working hard to correct them, if they criticize others, some people will disapprove and say: "Hey! He's criticizing others now, doesn't he think about his own mistakes?" This means that someone who has made mistakes and been criticized has lost the "qualification" to criticize others. If someone who has not been criticized criticizes others, some people will also disapprove and say: "Hey! He likes to criticize others so much, as if he will never make mistakes." This means that someone who might make mistakes in the future also doesn't have the "qualification" to criticize others. Such arguments often come first from those being criticized, but also affect some people who think they will inevitably make mistakes in the future, and also influence some people who are thinking of criticizing others.
    Although these are simply two "qualifications," probably no one can fully possess them. Because people who don't make mistakes are rare, it can even be said that they are impossible.
    However, in fact, "qualifications" are by no means limited to these two. For example, if young comrades who have just started working criticize some work or measures in their unit, or if unknown new forces criticize academic authorities, some people will immediately say angrily: "Oh! He also wants to criticize others. Doesn't he first ask himself how much millet he has eaten, how many years he has worked, and how many years he has studied!" Here, "millet," "work," "books," etc., are all the "qualifications" for criticism! Also, for example, the same criticism, if it comes from a subordinate, the person being criticized will be furious; if it comes from a superior, the person being criticized will be submissive. This distinction between "superior" and "subordinate" is also where the "qualifications" for criticism lie.
    Naturally, it is unacceptable for a bureaucrat to not admit their mistakes, but to turn around and criticize others for being bureaucratic, or to do something wrong and push the responsibility onto others, and then turn around and criticize others.
    Those being criticized should consider the criticism itself, not the "qualifications" for criticism, and even less should they use this as a reason to resist criticism. Those who advocate that criticism should have "qualifications" do not consider whether the criticism itself is correct at all. The more "qualifications" for criticism, the less criticism there will be. To demand "qualifications" for criticism is to only do so at the cost of completely eliminating the qualification for criticism itself to exist. Perhaps this is precisely the wish of those who hold this view!

### 批评的“资格”
凡人

    批评的“资格”
    凡人
    批评还要“资格”吗？据说是要的。
    比如曾经受过批评的人，虽然他早已改正了错误、或者正在努力改正，但如果批评别人，就会有人不以为然地说：“嘿！他也批评起别人了，不去想想自己的错误。”这就是说，犯过错误、受过批评的人就失去了批评别人的“资格”。没有受过批评的人批评别人，也会有人不以为然地说：“嘿！他这样爱批评别人，好像自己永远不会犯错误。”这就是说，将来可能犯错误的人也没有批评别人的“资格”。这样的主张往往首先来自被批评的人，但也波及到一些自以为将来难免不犯错误的人，还影响了一些正想批评别人的人。
    这虽然是简简单单的两项“资格”，恐怕还没有人能够完全具备。因为不犯错误的人是少有的，简直可以说是不可能有的。
    可是，事实上“资格”又何尝只此两项。比如年轻的，刚参加工作的同志批评了自己单位中一些工作或者措施，不为人知的新生力量批评了学术界的权威，就立刻会有人气愤地说：“好啊！他也要批评别人。不先问问自己究竟吃了多少小米，做过几年工作，读过几年书！”在这里，“小米”“工作”“书”等等都是批评的“资格”！又比如同样一个批评，来自下级，被批评者就勃然大怒；来自上级，被批评者就唯唯诺诺。这“上”“下”之分，也是批评的“资格”所在。
    自然，一个官僚主义者，不承认自己的错误，还要反过来批评别人是官僚主义，或者自己做错了事，把责任推给别人，翻过来再批评别人，这样的批评，是要不得的。
    被批评者要考虑的是批评本身，不是批评的“资格”，更不能因此来抵制批评。而主张批评应有“资格”的人，却根本不考虑批评本身是不是正确。批评的“资格”越多，批评就越少。要批评的“资格”，就只有以完全取消批评本身存在的资格为代价。这或许正是抱有这种主意的人的心愿吧！
