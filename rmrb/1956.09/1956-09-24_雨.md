    Rain
    Huang Qingjiang
    A day of rain.

    Before I even got out of bed in the morning, I heard the pitter-patter of raindrops like scattered beans. Soon, the eaves were gurgling with water. The east-facing window was battered by the wind, spraying a windowful of fine, fragmented rain.

    At noon, the sky was full of sorrowful clouds, and the silent rain fell steadily and densely. Sometimes the rain was as fine as hemp thread; if you didn't look, you might think it had stopped, but when you looked closely, it was still falling…

    At dusk, the wind was urgent and the rain slanted. The willow trees could not help but bend low, their strands swaying like a head of hair washed in water.

    Some six or seven-year-old children had been playing in the water in the field since early morning, grinning at passersby. Later, fourteen or fifteen-year-old children returned from the fields, barefooted, their trousers soaked, carrying several eel baskets. They went to Youxi's house, placed a large basin in the courtyard, opened one end of the eel basket, pulled out a stopper made of lotus leaves, and tipped it downwards. An eel slid into the basin, causing a commotion. Then another, and another… Big and small children gathered around to watch, jumping happily. When the last eel was poured into the basin, Youxi covered the basin with a piece of reed mat, turned around, and pointed at a child with a runny nose, saying, "Look at you, soaked like a water duck!" A child next to him looked up at the sky; raindrops kept hitting them. It was as if no one felt they were in the rain. Children never tire of rainy days, even the most depressing ones; they still find joy everywhere!

    A young female teacher appeared next door to Youxi's house. She looked up at the sky at the gate, paused in silence, and put on a pair of rubber shoes already covered in mud. The landlady said beside her:
    "The road is muddy; let us take you."
    She shook her head with a smile.
    "Let me give you something to help you walk."
    The old lady gave her a bamboo pole, not too short, not too long, reaching to her eyebrows.
    "Hmm, a bamboo from Jiangnan," she laughed, revealing a Jiangnan accent.
    "Don't you remember?" the old lady said again, "The first year you came to our village, you fell twice on the muddy road!"
    "That was when I just arrived in the countryside!" Her face flushed slightly. But she didn't take the bamboo pole and hurriedly left in the heavy rain.

    All afternoon, no one was seen passing through the village until, later, an old man with a head of white hair, wearing a wet, old raincoat, came here to rest. It turned out he was Zhu Shundi, from the township post office.
    "In this weather, which family are you delivering mail to?" the old lady asked.
    "To the accountant's house."
    "Where else are you going?"
    "Jiulizhuang, Waimuqiao, Caojiadu… and there's also Hongmiaozi, Grandma."
    "The road is hard to walk!"
    "I'm used to walking it." The old man stroked his beard, then complained to the heavens, "Hoping for it to rain, it doesn't; not hoping for it to rain, it insists on raining!"

    A gust of wind brought slanting rain to the door. "It's getting late!" The old man touched his mailbag and rushed into the rain.
    How can one say that no one dislikes rainy days? The difficulties it creates for the mailman make it truly an unpleasant rain, a detestable rain!

    Near dusk, the commune leader returned. Rain dripped from his forehead, and his blue cloth jacket and trousers were splattered with mud. He walked behind the door and placed the large shovel he was carrying to one side.

    On every such rainy day, the commune leader always makes a tour of the various cultivated areas.
    Youxi's mother brought out the supper. She said:
    "How are things in the fields?"
    "Water has been released into the upper paddy fields; I'll need to check on them again tonight."
    He was silently thinking about something. Every morning he goes out full of excitement, and every night he reflects with worries in his heart. I don't know, does he have more worries on sunny days? Or more worries on rainy days?

    Then, lanterns are lit, doors are closed, and the dense rain descends with the dusk, weaving a bottomless black net that envelops the surroundings…

    雨
    黄清江
    一天的雨。
    早上还没有起身，但听见雨点像撤豆似的滴滴拉拉响起来，随后，屋檐口一片水声。朝东的窗户，风冲击着，喷进一窗细碎的雨沫。
    中午满天愁云，无声的雨，绵绵密密。有时雨如同麻线一样细，不看时仿佛不在下了，细看时却还在下……
    黄昏时分，风急雨斜，柳树的腰杆禁不住俯仰低弯，丝条像一头水洗过的乱发一样摆动。
    有些六、七岁的孩子，一大早就在场上玩水。嘻皮笑脸地对过路人看着。后来，十四、五岁的孩子们从地里回来了，赤着脚，一裤子水，捧着几条鳝鱼篓子。他们走到有喜的家里，在天井当中，放了一只大水盆，把鳝鱼篓子的一头打开，扯出来一包荷叶做成的塞头，往下一倒，一条鳝鱼滑进水盆里了，于是水盆里一阵混乱。接着，又是一条，一条，……。大小孩子都围过来看，快活地跳跃着。最后一条鳝鱼倒进水盆，有喜把一片芦席朝水盆上一盖，回过头来指着一个鼻子上淌水的孩子说：“看你呀，淋得像水鸭子！”旁边一个孩子抬头望望天，雨点不停地打在他们身上。仿佛谁也不觉得自己是在雨中似的。孩子们从来不曾厌烦过雨天，那怕是最沉闷的雨天，他们仍然无处不是欢乐呀！
    有喜家隔壁出现一个年青的女教师。她在大门边望了望天色，沉默一回，穿起一双已经涂满了烂泥巴的胶鞋。房东老太在旁边说：
    “路上烂泥，我们送你去吧。”
    她微笑地摇摇头。
    “给你点什么东西拄拄脚。”
    老太拿给她一根竹子，不短不长，齐她的眉梢。
    “嗯，一根江南的竹子”她出声地一笑，而且显露出江南人的口音。
    “你不记得吗？”老太又说：“你头年到我们乡里，烂泥路上连跌了两跤呀！”
    “那是才到乡下呀！”她的脸一红。但并不拿起那根竹子，就匆匆地冒着急雨走了。
    一下午不见有人过庄，直到后来，才见一个花白胡子的老人，披着一件湿淋淋的旧雨衣，走到这里来歇脚。原来他是乡邮站的朱顺爹。
    “这天气，到那家送信呀？”老太问。
    “会计家里。”
    “还往那里走呀！”
    “九里庄、外木桥、曹家渡……还有个红庙子呢，奶奶。”
    “这路难走呀！”
    “走是也走惯了的。”老爹摸了摸胡子，然后埋怨老天说：“望它下，不下，不望它下，偏下呀！”
    一股风带着斜雨扑到门前。“不早啦！”老爹摸了摸信袋，一股劲冲进雨里去了。
    怎能说雨天没有人厌烦它呢，给送信人的阻难，真是不愉快的雨，讨厌的雨！
    近黄昏，社长回来了。额头上雨水淋淋，青布褂裤上都溅满了泥花，走到门背后，把手里那柄大锹搁在一边。
    每一个这样的雨天，社长总是要在各个耕作区巡回一转。
    有喜妈拿出了晚饭菜来。说：
    “地里怎样？”
    “上节田都放水了，夜里还要去望望。”
    他沉默地在那里想些什么了。每一天的早上他都是兴奋地出去，每一天的夜晚他都带着心事默想。我不知道，倒底他是晴天多心事呢？还是雨天多心事？
    随后，掌灯火、闭门户，密雨随着暮色同时降临，织成一张无底的黑色的大网笼罩着周围。……
