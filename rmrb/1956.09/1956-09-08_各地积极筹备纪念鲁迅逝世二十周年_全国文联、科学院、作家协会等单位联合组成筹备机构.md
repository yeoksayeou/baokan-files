Xinhua News Agency, 6th. This year, October 19th, marks the 20th anniversary of the death of Mr. Lu Xun, China's great revolutionary, thinker, and writer. Various regions across the country are actively preparing for commemorative activities.

    The preparatory organization for the "Commemorative Meeting for the 20th Anniversary of Mr. Lu Xun's Death" in the capital has been jointly formed by the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Chinese Writers Association, the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, the Chinese Artists Association, the China Education Trade Union, and the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries. Major cities will also hold commemorative meetings separately. From mid-September to the end of October, the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Writers Association will hold multiple report meetings for the people in Beijing and Shanghai to introduce Lu Xun's life and his works.

    The new Lu Xun tomb, currently under construction in Hongkou Park, Shanghai, is scheduled to be completed in early October. A grand ceremony will then be held to move Lu Xun's coffin from the International Cemetery to the new tomb. The exhibition hall project of the Beijing Lu Xun Museum is also nearing completion and is scheduled to open officially on October 19th. The Sanwei Study and Hundred Herbs Garden in Lu Xun's former residence in Shaoxing were damaged by typhoons this year and are now being actively repaired.

    Many writers in various regions are writing articles to commemorate Lu Xun. Some writers are writing academic papers on Lu Xun's thoughts and works, preparing to participate in academic report meetings held in the capital. Many artists are creating artistic works to commemorate Lu Xun or drawing illustrations for his posthumous works. The Chinese Musicians Association is also organizing musicians to compose songs commemorating Lu Xun. The documentary film "Lu Xun's Life" and the color film "Blessing," adapted from Lu Xun's novel of the same name, are nearing completion and will be released to the audience in October.

    The newly compiled and annotated "Complete Works of Lu Xun," published by the People's Literature Publishing House, consists of ten volumes, the first two of which will be published in October. This publishing house will also publish a book titled "Remembering Lu Xun," which includes twenty-six articles written by Mao Dun, Ba Jin, and others recalling Lu Xun. The Foreign Languages Press will also publish the first volume of the English version of "Selected Works of Lu Xun" in late September. "Wenyi Bao" and "Wenyi Yuebao" and other publications will have special issues commemorating Lu Xun.

    Writers from more than twenty countries will come to Beijing to participate in the capital's commemorative meeting.
