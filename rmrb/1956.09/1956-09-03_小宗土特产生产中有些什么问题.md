What are the Problems in the Production of Minor Native and Special Products?
The Rural Work Department of the Fengjie County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

Fengjie County, Sichuan Province, is a mountainous area with a wide variety of minor native and special products, totaling over 520 types according to surveys. It is rich in medicinal materials, wild animal hides, fruits, and miscellaneous goods, and also produces some tea. Among the 520 types, there are more than ten kinds of valuable industrial raw materials such as raw lacquer and red root, as well as Huangyang wood and fine combs that are sold far and wide in Tibet and the Jiangsu-Zhejiang area. These minor native and special products occupy an important position in agricultural and sideline production. According to 1955 statistics, the annual output value accounted for 15.44% of the total agricultural and sideline income of farmers in the county; in some major producing areas, it accounted for more than 30%, and the proportion was even greater in high-altitude areas.

In the past few years, we have done some work on the production of native and special products, and things that were worthless in the past can now be sold for money. For example, green oak (qing gang zi) was worthless in the past, but now the purchase price is five yuan per dan (approximately 50 kg). The prices of many products have also increased to varying degrees. In the past, one jin (approximately 0.5 kg) of tree ear (wood ear) could only be exchanged for five jin of salt, but now it can be exchanged for fifteen jin. This has played a certain role in promoting agricultural production and improving the lives of people in mountainous areas.

However, there are still many problems in developing the production of minor native and special products:

		“Holding a Golden Bowl Begging for Food”

First of all, we have insufficient understanding of leading the development of native and special products in mountainous areas, and we haven't grasped it tightly enough. We have not proceeded based on the characteristics of mountainous areas, such as "relying on the mountains for sustenance and planting what grows there." We often grasped one aspect and lost others. In the development of native and special products, we only focused on the large-scale ones and ignored the small-scale ones, thinking that "minor native and special products are not valuable" and not paying attention to them. This has made district and township cadres not pay attention to the development of minor native and special products, letting them develop on their own. Some cadres believe that "failure to complete the grain and cotton production plan will result in criticism, but failure to complete other production plans doesn't matter," and some even mistakenly believe that developing native and special products is developing capitalism. This erroneous practice seriously hinders the development of minor native and special products. For example, in terms of silkworm production, a sericulture bureau was established in the late Qing Dynasty, and sericulture schools were established, which were prosperous for a time. Before the war, more than 40,000 taels of raw silk were transferred out each year; but now the county's annual output is only more than 6,000 taels. The total output of Codonopsis pilosula (dang shen), one of the export medicinal materials, was only more than 170,000 jin last year, while the annual output of Junzi Township before the war reached 240,000 jin. We surveyed the main 63 kinds of minor native and special products. In 1955, the output of 27 kinds decreased compared with 1954, including 9 kinds of more valuable industrial raw materials. In the past, we simply focused our energy on grain and cotton production and did not pay enough attention to the production of minor native and special products. We have not conducted a more systematic survey of the distribution, output, value, and sales channels of various products, so we are not clear about the situation. For example, red root and elephant bowl (xiang wan) are raw materials for making roasted glue. Last year, only 5,400 dan were purchased, while the annual output can reach more than 50,000 dan. Due to insufficient understanding of the huge potential of mountainous areas and the failure to utilize abundant resources, the production of minor native and special products has not been developed as it should be. The masses say that we are "gold and silver have swelled and broken the mountains, and we are holding a golden bowl begging for food."

		Failure to Properly Implement the Mutually Beneficial Policy

In the agricultural cooperativization, some co-ops did not handle the tools and medicinal mountains of sideline production reasonably. For example, when Jinzhu Village in Xinglong District established a co-op, the medicinal land was incorporated into the co-op without compensation. The farmers behind the mountain said, "It's the same sooner or later, why bother!" and uprooted the medicinal seedlings. In some cases, there was insufficient publicity of specific policies during the cooperative movement, especially during the transition to advanced co-ops, and the masses had concerns. For example, Tang Yunzhong, a member of the Chuanbian Co-op in Xinglong District, dug up Codonopsis pilosula seedlings and sold them for more than 300 yuan. He said, "Dig one basket now is what you get, in the future the copper coins will be lost in the water, and you won’t even see a bubble."

		Lack of Unified Arrangement within the Cooperative

In many places, the co-op's sideline production plan has not been well implemented, and there is a lack of necessary help and encouragement for co-op members' household sideline occupations. The labor time of each member is controlled too strictly, leaving them no time to engage in household sideline occupations. For example, Chen Bensan, a member of the Shiru Co-op in Xinglong Township, was familiar with wild medicinal materials and repeatedly asked someone to guarantee him to go to the mountains to collect medicinal materials, but the co-op did not allow it. Fewer people are weaving straw hats and straw sandals. There are also fewer people hunting and collecting wild animals and plants.

In addition, the labor points for sideline occupations collectively operated by agricultural co-ops are set too low, and the principle of more work, more pay is not implemented, which also affects the enthusiasm of farmers to engage in minor native and special products. For example, collecting medicinal materials on the mountain, a laborer only gets ten points a day, but in general, collecting medicinal materials on the mountain is more difficult than working in the field, clothes and utensils are easily damaged, and work can be missed due to wind and rain. Therefore, people generally prefer to do farm work than collect medicinal materials.

		Low Purchase Price

There are still some problems in the implementation of price policies. The main problem is that the purchase price of some products is too low. For example, it takes six and a half workdays to collect one dan of elephant bowl (xiang wan), which is only worth five jiao (0.5 yuan), and each workday is only worth more than seven fen (0.07 yuan) on average, which is not enough to buy a pair of straw shoes. Someone said, "I would rather count stones in the river ditch than do this business." The purchase price of each dan of dry sunflower seeds is five yuan, which is two-thirds lower than the historical price in the past. As a result, the county's total output value in 1955 decreased by 60% compared with 1954. The unreasonable price, in addition to some objective reasons such as excessive transportation costs, is mainly due to some commercial departments adding "profits" at each level. The Fengping Supply and Marketing Cooperative purchases saposhnikovia divaricata (fang feng) for 19 fen per jin, and can make a net profit of 1 jiao if it is sold locally. When inspecting the grade, the idea of "rather low than high" is also held, and the policy of "superior goods, superior price, grading and pricing" cannot be implemented. In this way, the price policy cannot play a role in stimulating and guiding farmers to develop native and special products.

		Lack of Cooperation between Departments

After the supply and marketing cooperative system was divided with state-owned companies, the bulk native products were handed over to state-owned companies, and the purchasing business of the supply and marketing cooperative turned to minor native and special products. As a result, negative emotions appeared among the cadres, who believed that "minor native products have no big prospects and not much profit." When purchasing, they pay attention to large prices and dislike the trouble of sporadic and scattered minor native and special products. For example, the Junzi Township distribution store gives priority to the inspection, weighing, and payment of high-priced commodities such as codonopsis pilosula; while low-priced commodities such as akebia trifoliata are queued later and the grade and price are suppressed. Because cadres despise minor native and special products, their publicity and organization work in this area is very poor, and they have not tried to purchase everything that can be purchased. In some places, insufficient attention is paid to the balance of production, purchase, and sales, resulting in blind appeals. For example, the director of the Caotang District Supply and Marketing Cooperative promoted to the members' representatives: "Sparrows, mice, and grass snakes are all accepted." Some supply and marketing cooperatives mobilized the masses to collect prunella vulgaris, but then they didn't want them after the masses collected them. A farmer in the Zhuyuan District burned the prunella vulgaris he collected in the stove of the supply and marketing cooperative. The competent authorities mechanically stipulated that rural handicraft workers must organize specialized cooperatives separately, and emphasized the collective in everything, causing the handicraft production operated by individual farmers to stagnate. Some handicraft production that can be operated by agricultural co-ops is restricted too tightly. Various business departments have not properly helped solve the difficulties encountered by farmers in developing the production of minor native and special products in terms of materials, technology, and funds. Raising rabbits lacks mothers, feeding ducks lacks eggs, and planting medicine lacks seeds. According to a survey in Chaoyang Township, there is a shortage of more than 6,000 jin of fritillaria thunbergii seeds alone. In terms of technology, tapping lacquer kills trees, and the lacquer output rate is not high; digging medicine digs up the roots and damages the forest; hunting is not done according to the season, and wild animal hides are of low quality. There are also some poor farmers who want to engage in minor native and special products but lack capital. These problems are shirked by various departments, and no one is responsible, which has caused considerable difficulties in the development of minor native and special products.

		Solving Problems and Formulating Plans

In order to vigorously develop the production of minor native and special products, the county has now made a plan to strive for an 87% increase in the total output value of minor native and special products this year compared with last year, on the premise of comprehensively completing the agricultural and sideline production increase plan.

The county party committee has established a sideline production office. Under the unified leadership of the party committee, various business departments are specifically divided into work, and everything from production technology guidance to product acquisition is managed from top to bottom, correcting the phenomenon of mutual lack of cooperation and disconnection in business in the past. In June, we have dispatched 122 people and organized 19 working groups to go to various places to conduct a bottom-up survey of the purchase, production, and sales of minor native and special products with emphasis. On this basis, we will mobilize farmers to vigorously produce those that already have sales channels, especially important industrial raw materials, and collect samples, conduct tests, and trial-produce and trial-sell those that do not have clear sales channels to open up sales channels. At the same time, we will publicize the significance of developing sideline production to the farmers, and help agricultural co-ops make overall arrangements for agricultural and sideline occupations and uniformly allocate labor. Resolve the contradictions between agriculture and sideline occupations, and between co-ops and members.

In order to combine the sideline production of agricultural co-ops with the needs of the state, the county has established a three-person office for the combined contract system, responsible for guiding and promoting the combined contract system between supply and marketing co-ops and agricultural co-ops, combining the product purchasing work with the farmers' production plan, and signing corresponding contracts with handicraft workers and small vendors to connect the product purchasing and sales.

    小宗土特产生产中有些什么问题
    中共奉节县委农村工作部
    四川省奉节县是一个山区，小宗土特产品的品种繁多，据调查达五百二十多种。盛产药材、野兽皮张、瓜果，杂品也比较丰富，还出产一些茶叶。在五百二十个品种内，有生漆、红根等十多种贵重的工业原料，有远销西藏、江浙一带的黄阳木、细梳。这些小土特产在农副业生产中占有重要的地位。据1955年统计，年产总值占全县农民农副业总收入的15.44％；在一些主产区，占30％以上，高山区的比重更大。
    几年来，我们对土特产的生产进行了一些工作，过去不值钱的东西现在也能变卖成钱。如青杠子过去一文不值，现在每担收购价为五元。许多产品价格也有程度不同的提高。过去一斤木耳只能换五斤盐巴，现在能换十五斤。这对促进农业生产、改善山区人民的生活起了一定作用。
    但是，在发展小土特产的生产方面，还有很多问题：
        “端着金碗讨饭”
    首先，我们对领导山区发展土特产认识不足，抓得不紧。没有根据“靠山吃山、出啥种啥”的山区特点出发。往往抓了一面，丢了其他。在发展土特产上也只抓了大宗，丢了小宗，认为“小土特产价值不大”，看不上眼。这就使得区乡干部对发展小土特产的生产也不重视，任其自流。有的干部认为“粮棉生产完不成计划要检讨，其他生产完不成计划没有关系”，有的更错误地认为发展土特产就是发展资本主义。这种错误的作法，严重阻碍小土特产的发展。例如：蚕桑生产方面，清末曾设蚕桑局，举办蚕桑学校，繁荣一时，战前每年外调生丝也达四万多两；而现在全县年产仅有六千多两。出口药材中的党参，去年全县总产才十七万多斤，而君子乡战前年产即达二十四万多斤。我们调查了主要的六十三种小土特产，1955年产量比1954年下降的有二十七种，其中有九种是较贵重的工业原料。由于过去单纯把精力放在粮棉生产上，对小土特产的生产注意不够，没有对各种产品的分布、产量、价值和销路等情况，作一次较系统的调查，因此，心中无数。例如，红根、象碗是制烤胶的原料，去年只收购五千四百担，而年产可达五万多担。由于对山区巨大潜力认识不足，丰富资源未被利用，使小土特产的生产不能得到应有的发展。群众说，我们是“金银涨破了山，端起金碗讨饭”。
    没有很好地执行互利政策
    在农业合作化中，有的社对副业生产的工具、药山等处理不合理。如兴隆区金竹村建社时，药地无偿入社；山后的农民说：“早晚一个样，何必再搞！”把药苗连根拔掉了。也有的是在合作化运动中，特别是在转高级社过程中，对具体政策宣传不够，群众产生顾虑。如兴隆区川边社社员唐云仲挖掉党参幼苗，卖了三百多元。他说：“现在挖一兜算一兜，将来铜钱丢在水里，泡泡都见不到一个。”
      社内缺乏统一安排
    许多地方，社里的副业生产计划没有很好地贯彻执行，对社员家庭副业也缺乏应有的帮助和鼓励，把每个社员的劳动时间控制得过严过死，使他们没有时间去经营家庭副业。如兴隆乡石乳社社员陈本三熟悉野生药材，曾三番五次请人担保，要求上山采药，社里也不放行。编织草帽、草鞋的人少了。狩猎、采集野生动植物的也少了。
    此外，农业社集体经营的副业，劳动工分订得偏低，没有贯彻多劳多得的原则，也影响了农民经营小土特产的积极性。例如上山采药，一个劳动力，在山上一天，只评给十分，但一般在山上采药比在地里干活苦，衣服、用具又容易损坏，加上遇到风雨还会误工。因此，一般宁肯做农活，不愿采药。
        收购价格偏低
    在执行价格政策方面，还有一些问题。主要是某些产品收购价格偏低，如象碗要六个半工才能采摘一担，仅值五角钱，每个工平均只有七分多，买不到一双草鞋。有人说：“我情愿到河沟数石头，也不愿做这个买卖。”向日葵每担干货收购价为五元，较过去历史价格降低三分之二，结果全县总产值1955年比1954年减少60％。价格不合理，除运费过高等某些客观原因外，主要是部分商业部门层层加“利润”。冯平供销社，收购防风每斤一角九分，若就地出售，即可净赚一角。验级时也抱着宁低勿高的思想，“优货优价，分等论价”的政策不能执行。这样，价格政策就不能起到刺激和指导农民发展土特产的作用。
        各部门互不协作
    供销合作社系统，在同国营公司分工之后，大宗土产交给国营公司经营，供销社采购业务转向小土特产，于是干部中出现了消极情绪，认为“小土产搞头不大，油水不多”。在采购的时候，重视价大的，对零星、分散的小土特产就嫌麻烦。例如君子乡分销店，对党参等价大的商品，就优先验级，优先过称、付款；对木通等价小的商品，则排队在后，并压级压价。由于干部轻视小土特产，对这方面的宣传、组织工作就很差，没有想办法把一切可以收购的东西收购起来。还有些地方，对产、购、销的平衡注意不够，产生盲目号召的现象。如草堂区供销社主任向社员代表宣传：“麻雀、老鼠、菜花蛇一律都收。”有的供销社动员群众采集夏枯草，群众采来以后又不要了。竹圆区一个农民把采来的夏枯草放到供销社的灶里烧掉。主管单位机械规定农村手工业工人必须单独组织专业合作社，事事强调集体，致使农民个人经营的手工业生产陷于停顿。有些可以由农业社经营的手工业生产限制得太紧。各业务部门对农民发展小土特产生产，在物质上、技术上、资金上遇到的困难，没有妥善帮助解决。养兔缺母，喂鸭缺卵，种药缺种。据朝阳乡调查，光贝母种就缺六千多斤。技术方面，割漆割死树，出漆率不高；挖药挖掉根，并破坏了林木；狩猎不按季节，野生皮张低劣等。还有一些贫苦农民想经营小土特产，但缺乏本钱。这些问题，各部门相互推诿，无人负责，给发展小土特产造成了相当大的困难。
      解决问题，订出规划
    为了大力发展小土特产品的生产，现在全县已作出规划，在全面完成农副业增产计划的条件下，争取小宗土特产品今年总产值比去年增加87％。
    县委成立副业生产办公室，在党委统一领导下，各业务部门具体分工，从上到下，从生产技术指导到产品收购，全部管起来，纠正过去业务上互不协作、互相脱节的现象。在6月份，我们已经抽调了一百二十二人，组织了十九个工作组，分赴各地，有重点地对小宗土特产的购、产、销作了摸底排队。在这基础上，对已有销路的，特别是重要的工业原料，动员农民大力生产，对不明销路的先做样品搜集、化验和试制、试销等工作，开辟销路。同时向农民群众宣传发展副业生产的意义，并帮助农业社对农副业加以全盘安排，统一调配劳力。解决农业与副业、社与社员的矛盾。
    为了把农业社的副业生产同国家需要结合起来，县里建立了结合合同制三人办公室，负责指导推行供销社与农业社的结合合同制，把产品的采购工作和农民生产的计划结合起来，同手工业者、小商小贩也签订相应的合同，把产品的采购、销售衔接起来。
