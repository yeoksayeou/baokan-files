    Xinhua News Agency: The autumn fishing season in Guangdong has begun, and fishing boats in coastal ports are setting sail more than ten days earlier than in previous years. In the Shantou and Weizhou fishing grounds, where the fishing season started earlier, more than 1,000 large and medium-sized fishing boats from distant Hainan, Zhanjiang, Foshan and local fishing ports have begun production. And they have caught a large amount of seafood in the early days of the fishing season. The autumn fishing season production headquarters or working groups set up in various fishing ports have been equipped with personnel to specifically lead the autumn fishing season production. Purchasing stations in the fishing ports have been prepared to ensure that fish catches are purchased as soon as they arrive, and can be purchased at night. As of now, nearly 800 new boats and more than 1,000 old boats that have been repaired have been put into production by local fishery supply and marketing cooperatives responsible for material supply.
