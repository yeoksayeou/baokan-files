Vehicle-Centric

Spitting is not allowed on buses and trolleybuses. Some passengers genuinely abide by this rule, but they stick their heads out of the window and spit a large mouthful of phlegm outside. Some people are far from the window, and if they stretch their necks and use all their strength, the "ptui" sound indicates they are spitting. This situation is extremely common. It neither violates the rules of the bus nor goes against public morality on the bus, so people on the bus see this and just blink and let it go. Conductors never care.

As for passengers eating melon seeds, conductors often shout responsibly, "Comrades eating honeydew melon, please throw the seeds outside!"

This is a very small matter, but it is clearly and unmistakably a manifestation of departmentalism.　Zhang Wenzhu

    车本位
    公共汽车和电车上都是不准吐痰的，有些乘客真的遵守了这条规则，可是却把头伸到车窗去，一大口一大口地把痰吐到车外去了。有人离车窗远，如果伸长了脖子，用尽了力量，“呸”地一声的时候，准是在吐痰。这种情形极为普遍，既不违犯乘车规则，也不违背车上的公共道德，所以车上的人看见这种情况，眨眨眼睛就算完事。售票员从来不管。
    对于吃瓜果的乘客，售票员还常常认真负责地喊：“吃香瓜的同志，请你把瓜子摔到外边吧！”
    这是极小的事，但这分明是不折不扣的本位主义。　张文铸
