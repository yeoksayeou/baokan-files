    "Good Times Don't Last"
    Jing Shan
    Distributions of dividends from joint ventures for the first half of the year have been successively made across various regions, which should be a joyous occasion for industrialists and businessmen. The vast majority of capitalist personnel are elated. However, with so many people, unanimity of thought is impossible. There are still quite a few who harbor feelings of nostalgia and regret for the past! They say: "A fixed interest rate of five percent is certainly good, but it's a pity that it won't last long." Others say, "Although the fixed interest is high, the capital is gone forever." In short, the sentiment is that "good times don't last."
    The sentiments of these people are not difficult to understand. Standing on their original positions, wearing tinted glasses, they see a bleak and dark future.
    What these people call "good times" is nothing more than: free markets, unearned income. To preserve these "good times" for a minority, the circumstances of the majority would be dire; inevitably, this would be opposed by the majority. Would this kind of "scene" really be "good" for the capitalist personnel themselves?
    The real good times lie ahead, and they will not only last forever but will also get better and better. The question is: Should one stand tall and stride forward, or turn around and look back with endless sorrow? To ensure truly lasting good times, there is only one way: quickly turn around, stand in the ranks of the hundreds of millions of great people marching towards socialism, and contribute your strength to creating a truly beautiful scene – building the motherland into a socialist garden. The door to this great garden is open, and the Chinese working people do not exclude bourgeois elements from socialist construction. The road to socialism is so broad! Strive to learn new principles and new knowledge, and fully utilize your experience in managing enterprises. Your fate is in your own hands, as long as you work together to run joint public-private enterprises well, and truly transform yourselves into self-reliant laborers. At that time, you will be like other laborers, masters of the good times of socialism.

    “好景不常”
    荆山
    各地陆续发放合营企业的上半年股息了，对工商业者来说，这该是一件大喜事。绝大多数资方人员都是兴高采烈。但毕竟是人多心不齐，认识也不可能一致。带有留恋和惋惜过去的情感的也还不乏其人哩！他们说：“定息五厘固然不错，可惜拿的时间不长了。”又说“定息虽高，但从此本钱没有了。”总之一句话是“好景不常”。
    这些人的心情是不难理解的。他们站在原来的立场，戴着茶墨的眼镜，看起来眼前一片黄黑。
    这些人的所谓“好景”，不外乎是：自由市场，不劳而获。要保留这少数人的“好景”，多数人的景况就不妙了；这样，势必遭到多数人的反对；这种“景”，对于资方人员个人来说，也未必甚“好”吧？
    真正的好景就在前边，它不但会永远长在，而且会越来越好。问题就在于：是挺起胸膛迈开大步向前走呢？还是回转头去无限悲伤地向后瞧呢？要想永保真正的好景，就只有一个办法：赶快掉转头来，站在奔向社会主义的几万万伟大的人民的行列里，为创造真正的美景——把祖国建设成社会主义的大花园，贡献出来自己的力量。走向这个大花园的大门是敞开着的，中国的劳动人民并不把资产阶级分子排除在社会主义建设事业之外。社会主义的路是多么宽广啊！努力学习新道理新知识吧，把管理企业的经验充分地运用出来吧。你们的命运掌握在你们自己的手里，只要在共同办好公私合营企业，真正把自己改造成为自食其力的劳动者，那时候，你们也就同别的劳动者一样，成为社会主义的好景的主人。
