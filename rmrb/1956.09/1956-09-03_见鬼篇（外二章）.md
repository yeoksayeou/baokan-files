    Ghost Story (With Two Other Chapters)
  　Wen Huaisha
    A man lost his axe. He suspected that one of his neighbor's children had stolen it, so he thought: this child walks like a thief, this child's face also looks like a thief... In short, he felt that this child's every move, every word and smile, was full of thieving mannerisms and a guilty conscience. He believed that his "bold observation" and "careful research" already confirmed that the axe must have been stolen by this child.

    Just then, he suddenly found that his axe had not been lost after all. He looked at the child again and felt that the child didn't walk like a thief, and the child's face didn't look like a thief... In short, he felt that the child's every move, every word, and smile had no trace of thievery and were all very natural.

    So the man spat and said, "What the hell, it's like seeing a ghost!"

    Recommending the Virtuous and Capable
    Duke Ping of Jin asked his minister Qi Huangyang, "Now there is a vacancy for an official in Nanyang. Who do you think is suitable to take the position?"
      "Please send Xie Hu. He will certainly be able to handle it."
      "Huh? Isn't Xie Hu your personal enemy?" Duke Ping asked in surprise and with a smile.
      "That's right!" Qi Huangyang replied seriously, "This man does have some personal grudges with me. But you asked who could take that position. I believe that Xie Hu's talent and virtue are sufficient to take on the responsibility, so I recommend him. This is a matter of national importance and has nothing to do with my personal hatred."
    So Duke Ping appointed Xie Hu. The people were very satisfied.

    Another time, Duke Ping of Jin asked Qi Huangyang, "I want to choose a general. Who do you think is suitable?"
    "Qi Wu is not bad."
    "Qi Wu? Isn't he your son?"
    "Yes, Qi Wu is indeed my son."
    "Aren't you afraid that others will say you have a selfish motive? Why do you recommend your son so openly without avoiding suspicion?"
    Qi Huangyang said very seriously, "What you asked was who could be a general. I know that Qi Wu is capable. Although he is my son, what I consider is the country. If I were to avoid suspicion and not speak, what good would it do for the country? I ask myself, I am not ashamed of the country or the people. I am an upright person. Why should I avoid suspicion, and why should I be afraid of what others say?"
    So Duke Ping appointed Qi Wu as general.

    The people praised this decision as correct.

    This realistic and fair attitude is commendable. It is called: "Recommending others without avoiding enemies; recommending relatives without avoiding family."

    Using Wine as Water
    King Gong of Chu and Duke Li of Jin fought a great battle in Yanling. The Chu army was defeated, and the King of Chu was shot in the eye.

    During the battle, Sima Zifan, the commander of Chu, was thirsty and asked his subordinates for some water. His trusted servant, Shu Yanggu, saw that his superior was so thirsty and couldn't bear it, so he wanted to be considerate. Therefore, he specially brought a jar of wine to Zifan, because he knew that his superior usually loved to drink. Zifan smelled the wine, shook his head and refused, and loudly rebuked, "Take it away! I don't want wine!"
    "This is not wine, it is water!" Shu Yanggu knew his superior well and cared for him.
      "Take it away quickly!" Zifan hurriedly stepped back and shouted.
      "This is indeed water, not wine!" Shu Yanggu insisted.
    Zifan knew it was wine, but since the other party repeatedly said it wasn't, he thought that the surrounding officers and soldiers would not discover the secret; at the same time, he really couldn't resist the temptation of the wine. He finally used wine as water and drank it all. The wine was gone, and he was drunk.

    The war temporarily came to a halt. The King of Chu attempted to arrange another battle and specially sent someone to summon Zifan to plan together. However, Zifan excused himself, saying that he had a stomach ailment and could not come. The King of Chu was very anxious and came to see Zifan in person. As soon as he entered the tent, he smelled a strong smell of alcohol. He saw Zifan snoring drunkenly. The King of Chu understood and said to the crowd, "Since I am injured, I can no longer command the army, and I can only rely on Zifan. But he, as the commander, is actually drinking heavily before the battle, not only forgetting the rise and fall of the Chu Kingdom, but also being too unconcerned about the lives and deaths of our officers and soldiers. What battle can we fight?"

    The King of Chu killed Zifan and returned to the country.

    见鬼篇（外二章）
  　文怀沙
    有个人把斧子丢了。他怀疑是邻居的一个孩子偷去的，于是他觉得：这孩子走路的样子像贼，这孩子的脸色也像贼，……。总之，他觉得这孩子的一举一动、一言一笑，全是贼腔贼调、贼胆心虚的模样。他认为他这种“大胆的观察”和“细心的研究”，已经可以肯定斧子一定是这孩子偷的了。
    正在这时，他忽然发现他的斧子原来并没有丢。他再看这孩子，觉得这孩子走路的样子不像贼，这孩子的脸色也不像贼，……。总之他觉得这孩子的一举一动、一言一笑，并无丝毫贼意，全很自然。
    于是这个人啐了一声说：“真它妈的见鬼！”

    举贤与能
    晋平公问大臣祁黄羊：“如今南阳地方缺一个官，你看谁去担任比较合适呢？”
      “请派解狐去，他一定能胜任的。”
      “咦，解狐不是和你有些私仇吗？”平公惊讶而微笑地问。
      “不错！”祁黄羊严肃地回答：“这人确和我个人有点私仇。但您问的是谁可以担任那个职务，我认为解狐的才、德都足以担当，所以我推举他。这是国家大事，和我的私人仇恨不相干。”
    于是平公就任用了解狐。老百姓都很满意。
    又一次，晋平公问祁黄羊：“我想选一个做将军的人，你看谁比较合适呢？”
    “祁午还不错。”
    “祁午？他不是你的儿子么？”
    “是的，祁午确是我的儿子。”
    “那你不怕别人说你有私心吗？为什么你竟这样不避嫌疑，公然推举你的儿子？”
    祁黄羊十分严肃地说：“你所问的是什么人可以做这个将领，我了解祁午可以胜任。虽然他是我的儿子，但我考虑的是国家。如果我要避嫌疑不说，对国家有什么好处？我自问于国于人，无所亏愧；为人光明磊落，为什么要避嫌疑，更何必怕别人说闲话？”
    平公也就任用了祁午为将军。
    老百姓又赞誉这件事做得对。
    这种实事求是的公正态度是值得称道的。这叫做：“外举不避仇；内举不避亲”。

    以酒为水
    楚龚王和晋厉公在鄢陵地方大战。楚兵吃了败仗，楚王还被射伤了一只眼睛。
    战斗中，楚国的统帅司马子反渴了，叫部下给他点水喝。他素来亲信的竖阳谷，看到长官这般渴相，心中不忍，想体贴一下，所以特地把一罐子酒送到子反的面前，因为他知道长官平日嗜酒。子反嗅到酒味，摇手拒绝，并且大声怒斥：“拿开！我不要酒！”
    “这不是酒，这是水啊！”竖阳谷是熟知长官，爱护长官的。
      “快快拿走！”子反急忙退后一步嚷叫起来。
      “这确实是水，不是酒！”竖阳谷坚持着。
    子反明知是酒，但对方既然再三说不是，想来四周的官兵们不会发现这个秘密；同时自己实在已经无法拒绝这酒味的诱惑。他终于以酒为水，一饮而尽。酒尽了，人也醉了。
    战争暂时告一段落。楚王企图布置另一次战斗，特地派人召子反共同筹划。可是子反托辞心胃有病，不能应召。楚王很着急，亲自来看子反。一走进帐幕，就嗅到一股浓烈的酒臭，只见子反醉醺醺地鼾睡着。楚王明白了，对众人说：“我既受伤，不能再指挥军队了，只有依靠子反。而他身为主帅，竟临阵酗酒，不独忘了楚国的兴亡，也太不关心我们官兵们的死活了。还打什么仗呢？”
    楚王就杀了子反，班师回国了。
