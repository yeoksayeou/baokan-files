    People from All Circles in Beijing Protest Against West German Authorities' Persecution of the German Communist Party Congress Resolution
    We, the people from all circles in Beijing, unanimously express our great indignation at the fascist atrocities committed by the West German authorities in persecuting the German Communist Party. People from all circles in Beijing protest against the West German authorities' persecution of the German Communist Party Congress resolution: We lodge a serious protest and moral condemnation against the West German authorities; we extend our cordial greetings to the German Communist Party and all West German people who have been subjected to fascist persecution; and we firmly support the German Communist Party and the West German people in their heroic struggle against West German militarism, to defend democratic rights, and to strive for the peaceful reunification of their motherland.
    The West German authorities' act of banning the German Communist Party proves that the Adenauer reactionary group is following a dangerous path taken by Hitler – the path of fascist rule and preparation for war; it also shows that international war forces are unwilling to accept the trend of international easing and are trying to actively support West German militarism in Europe, deepen the division of the German nation, create tension in Europe, and undermine peace and security in Europe and the world. Therefore, resisting this anti-democratic and anti-peace current of the West German authorities is not only the responsibility of the West German people, but also the responsibility of all peace-loving and progress-cherishing people in the world.
    Today, eleven years after the world's people achieved the great victory in the anti-fascist war, to allow the revival of fascist forces in West Germany and to allow West Germany to be cultivated as a hotbed for launching wars is the greatest crime against progressive humanity. We, the people from all circles in Beijing, vow to stand with the entire Chinese people and the people of the world to firmly support the heroic struggle of the German Communist Party and the West German people against fascist tyranny, and we are willing to make great efforts to promote the cause of world peace and human progress.
    The struggle of the German people is not isolated. The West German authorities' insistence on implementing its anti-democratic and anti-peace policies can only lead to its own demise. We firmly believe that the German Communist Party will continue to exist and will surely lead the West German people to overcome all obstacles and achieve the final victory in the cause of striving for peace, democracy, and the reunification of the German nation.

    北京市各界人民抗议西德当局
    迫害德国共产党大会决议
    我们北京市各界人民对西德当局迫害德国共产党的法西斯暴行，一致表示极大的义愤。北京市各界人民抗议西德当局迫害德国共产党大会决议：对西德当局提出严重的抗议和道义上的谴责；对德国共产党和一切受到法西斯迫害的西德人民，致以亲切的慰问；并坚决支援德国共产党和西德人民反对西德军国主义、保卫民主权利和争取自己祖国的和平统一的英勇斗争。
    西德当局禁止德国共产党的行动，证明阿登纳反动集团是正在走着一条希特勒走过的危险道路——法西斯统治和准备战争的道路；同时也说明国际战争势力不甘心于国际局势的趋向和缓，而力图在欧洲积极扶植西德军国主义，加深德国民族的分裂，制造欧洲紧张形势，破坏欧洲和全世界的和平和安全。因此，抗击西德当局这种反民主、反和平的逆流，不仅是西德人民的责任，也是全世界一切爱好和平、珍视人类进步的人民的责任。
    在世界人民取得反法西斯战争的伟大胜利已有十一年的今天，听任法西斯势力在西德的复活，容许把西德培植成为发动战争的温床，就是对于进步人类的最大的犯罪。我们北京市各界人民誓和全中国人民一道，和全世界人民一道，坚决支持德国共产党和西德人民反抗法西斯暴政的英勇斗争，并愿以极大的努力促进争取世界和平和人类进步的事业。
    德国人民的斗争不是孤立的，西德当局坚持执行其反民主、反和平的政策只能得到使自己走上绝路的结果。我们坚决相信，德国共产党必将继续存在下去，并且一定会领导西德人民冲破一切障碍，在争取和平、民主和德国民族重新统一的事业中，获得最后的胜利。
