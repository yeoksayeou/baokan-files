Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, August 31st: The People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic held its 15th session on the 30th and passed the first readings of two draft laws concerning the further expansion of democracy. One is the draft law on the rights and obligations of the People's Chamber to local people's representative bodies, and the other is the draft law on local state power organs.

The deputies listened to and discussed a report on these two draft laws given by People's Chamber Vice-Chairman Matern. Matern pointed out that these two draft laws summarize hundreds of suggestions from the broad working people, various parties, and organizations of the German Democratic Republic regarding the further expansion of democracy. Matern said that in implementing the principle of democratic centralism, we have now reached the point where we should correct excessive centralization in order to fully exert the rights of local people's representative bodies. The expansion of the powers of local state organs will lead to the full development of democratic centralism, removing the obstacles to initiative and creativity caused by excessive centralization.

After explaining the contents of the two draft laws in detail, Matern pointed out that these two draft laws were drafted with the broad participation of people from all walks of life, and their importance will be second only to the Constitution.

The deputies held heated discussions on Matern's report and passed the first readings of the two draft laws. The People's Chamber decided to hand over these two draft laws to the relevant committees for further discussion and revision before submitting them to the People's Chamber for a second reading.

    民主德国人民议院根据广大劳动人民建议
    决定扩大民主发挥地方的主动性
    新华社柏林31日电　德意志民主共和国人民议院30日举行第十五次会议，一读通过了两项有关进一步扩大民主的法律草案。一项是人民议院对地方人民代表机构的权利和义务法草案，一项是地方国家权力机构法草案。
    议员们听取和讨论了人民议院副主席马特恩就这两项法律草案所作的报告。马特恩指出：这两项法律草案总结了民主德国的广大劳动人民，各党派和团体所提出的几百件有关进一步扩大民主的建议。马特恩说：在贯彻民主集中制原则的过程中，我们现在已经发展到了应该纠正过分的集中现象的地步，以便充分发挥地方人民代表机构的权利。地方国家机构职权的扩大将导致民主集中制的充分发展，扫除由于过分的集中而造成的对于发挥主动性和创造性的障碍。
    马特恩在对两项法律草案的内容作了详细的说明以后指出，这两项法律草案是在各阶层人民的广泛参与下草拟的，它们的重要性将仅次于宪法。
    议员们就马特恩的报告进行了热烈的讨论，并且一读通过了这两项法律草案。人民议院决定把这两项法律草案交给有关的委员会继续进行讨论和修正，然后再提交人民议院二读通过。
