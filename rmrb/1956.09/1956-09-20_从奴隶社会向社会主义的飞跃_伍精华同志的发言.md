    The Leap from Slave Society to Socialism
    Speech by Comrade Wu Jinghua

    I completely agree with the reports of Comrades Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, and Deng Xiaoping.

    The Yi people in the Liangshan area of Sichuan Province were basically still in a slave society not long ago. With the urgent demands of the vast slave masses, democratic reforms began in early this year throughout the region, which has a population of 970,000. By the end of August, this work had been completed in areas accounting for two-thirds of the population. Now, I would like to address the conference on the question of how the Yi people in the Liangshan area can directly transition to socialism after the abolition of slavery.
          Four Conditions

    After the abolition of slavery and the completion of democratic reforms in the Yi areas, the policy of vigorously developing mutual aid and cooperative organizations and directly transitioning to socialism was adopted in order to change the extremely backward economic and cultural state of the Yi areas as quickly as possible. This was decided based on the following characteristics and conditions: First, although the slave masses obtained some land and other means of production and livelihood after being liberated by the completion of democratic reform, they still could not solve their serious difficulties in production and life. For example, a relatively common situation was that they lacked three-fifths of seeds, half of the cattle and farm tools, and more than one-third of food grain, and also lacked housing and utensils. Especially because slaves did not have the right to marry, "going it alone" encountered many insurmountable difficulties, and only by taking the road of cooperativization could these difficulties be overcome more quickly. Second, the vast slave masses had a habit of collective labor in the past, and their concept of private ownership of the means of production was relatively weak, so they could easily accept the idea of collective forms of agricultural cooperativization. Third, under the influence of the decisive victory already achieved in the socialist transformation of the whole country, especially the realization of agricultural cooperativization in the Han areas surrounding Liangshan, the liberated slave masses were prompted to demand to participate in agricultural cooperatives as soon as possible. Fourth, in the course of several years of work and democratic reform, a large number of activists emerged, a large number of ethnic minority cadres were trained, and a number of Party and Communist Youth League organizations were developed. Finally, the state has provided and will continue to provide assistance in various aspects to the extent possible. These are the main bases on which we have adopted the above-mentioned policy. The establishment and growth of one cooperative can illustrate that the above-mentioned policy is correct and can be realized.
          A Banner

    The Nanping Agricultural Production Cooperative in Chengnan Township, Zhaojue County, is a higher-level form of cooperative directly established on the basis of the victorious completion of democratic reform on March 20th this year, bypassing mutual aid teams and primary cooperatives. The entire cooperative has 36 households and 95 people, including 18 households and 30 people of Guozhuang (slaves without personal freedom), 6 households and 23 people of Anjia (slaves with only a little freedom), and 12 households and 42 people of poor Quno (serfs who have not completely escaped the oppression and exploitation of slave owners). Among them, there is 1 Party member, 5 Communist Youth League members, and 17 activists. During the reform, they were allocated more than 110 mu of field and more than 130 mu of land (including their own field and land, they now have a total of 372 mu), 3 cattle (including their own cattle, they have a total of 8 cattle), and more than 8,000 jin of grain, and their enthusiasm for production has generally increased. After publicizing the benefits of running agricultural cooperatives to them, they generally said happily: "It is really a double blessing that cooperatives are run after the democratic reform." "Combining two steps into one, we can walk directly to socialist society in one step, how great is that!" "The land of each household is about the same, so there is no need for land compensation." "Payment according to labor encourages the working people and saves a lot of trouble in accounting."

    After the establishment of the cooperative, the first thing was to solve the difficulties of the members in production and life: the state gave various loans of more than 1,000 yuan, purchased more than 3,000 jin of seeds, 5 cattle, and more than 4,500 jin of food grain, and distributed more than 80 pieces of farm tools free of charge, helped them repair 5 houses, and bought necessary utensils. After discussion by the members, the target of increasing the yield of spring crops by 26% was set, and the two key points of increasing production by vigorously accumulating fertilizer and improving farming techniques were found. Based on the residential situation and the principle of facilitating leadership and farming, three production teams and three farming areas were divided, and simple and easy-to-implement methods were adopted to arrange tasks and evaluate work points, which changed the chaos in the initial stage. In this way, the members' morale became increasingly full and their labor efficiency was very high, about twice as high as when they were working for slave owners in the past. Within 23 days after the establishment of the cooperative, 484 loads of fertilizer were accumulated, and various tasks in the cooperative were completed 5 to 7 days earlier than outside the cooperative. This year, the crops of the cooperative were not only cultivated in a timely manner, but also improved some farming techniques, and the production income greatly exceeded that of previous years. The total income of the cooperative is about 85,000 jin of raw grain and more than 400 yuan of sideline income. The average income of each member is more than 900 jin of grain. Compared with last year, the yield per unit area increased by about 30%, and the members received about 37% more grain than farmers outside the cooperative. At the same time, the close collective farming among the members not only increased production but also further strengthened national unity. Therefore, the Nanping Cooperative has a very high prestige among the nearby farmers. In the natural village where the cooperative is located, with 120 households, all have participated in mutual aid teams, and more and more poor working people are asking to join the cooperative, while some of the nearby primary cooperatives are also asking to be transformed into advanced cooperatives as soon as possible. The Nanping Cooperative has formed a banner for uniting the masses and taking the socialist road.

    Judging from the example of the Nanping Cooperative, it is necessary and possible to run high-level cooperatives directly among the liberated slave masses, but there are also many difficulties. The main difficulty is that the Yi culture is very backward, the writing is still being created, and a relatively complete management system cannot be established in a short period of time. Therefore, when running cooperatives in the Yi areas, it is necessary to proceed from the requirements and conditions of the local masses. On the one hand, it is necessary to actively organize them to participate in agricultural cooperatives based on the characteristics that the liberated slaves cannot go it alone and are suitable for collective production. On the other hand, simple and easy-to-implement systems and methods for establishing and running cooperatives should be adopted. For a considerable period of time, cooperatives should be small rather than large, and the cooperative rules should be simple rather than complicated, and special help should be given to them to solve the difficulties of cultural backwardness, so as to gradually improve and enhance them. We believe that with the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and the brilliant achievements of the socialist construction of our great motherland, our country is fully capable of giving strong assistance in political, economic, cultural, and technical aspects according to the social conditions and needs of the Liangshan Yi people, so that the poor and backward Yi society can directly transition to socialist society through the road of cooperativization, bypassing the two historical stages of feudal society and capitalist society, and catch up with the level of advanced ethnic groups as soon as possible.

    从奴隶社会向社会主义的飞跃
    伍精华同志的发言
    我完全同意刘少奇同志、周恩来同志、邓小平同志的报告。
    我们四川省凉山地区的彝族在不久以前基本上还处于奴隶社会阶段，全区九十七万人，在广大奴隶群众的迫切要求下，今年初开始实行民主改革，到八月底止已经有三分之二人口的地区完成了这一工作。现在我仅就凉山地区的彝族在废除奴隶制度后就能够直接向社会主义过渡的问题向大会作一发言。
          四个条件
    在彝族地区废除奴隶制度，完成了民主改革后，为了尽快地改变彝族地区经济文化十分落后的状态，紧接着采取大力发展互助合作组织，直接向社会主义过渡的方针。这是根据下列的特点和条件所决定的：第一、奴隶群众在完成民主改革获得解放后，虽然取得一些土地和其他生产生活资料，但仍然不能解决他们在生产、生活方面的严重困难，比如较为普遍的情况是种子缺五分之三，耕牛、农具缺一半，口粮缺三分之一以上，住房、用具也很缺乏，特别是因为奴隶没有婚配，“单干”遇到许多不可克服的困难，只有走合作化的道路，才能更快地来克服这些困难。第二、广大奴隶群众过去都有集体劳动的习惯，生产资料的私有观念也比较薄弱，因而也容易接受集体形式的农业合作化的主张。第三、在全国社会主义改造已经取得决定性的胜利，特别是凉山周围汉族地区实现了农业合作化的影响下，促使解放了的奴隶群众要求尽快的参加到农业合作社中来。第四、在几年来的工作过程中和民主改革中，涌现了大批积极分子，培养了大批民族干部，发展了一批党、团组织。最后，国家又在可能条件下给了并且还将继续给以各方面的支援。这些，都是我们采取上述方针的主要根据。从一个合作社的建立和生长情况就可以说明上述方针是正确的、是能够实现的。
          一面旗帜
    昭觉县城南乡南坪农业生产合作社，是今年三月二十日在民主改革胜利完成的基础上，越过互助组和初级社直接建立的一个高级形式的合作社。全社共三十六户，九十五人，计锅庄（没有人身自由的奴隶）十八户，三十人，安家（仅有稍许自由的奴隶）六户，二十三人，贫苦曲诺（尚未完全摆脱奴隶主压迫剥削的农奴）十二户，四十二人，其中有党员一人，团员五人，积极分子十七人，他们在改革中分得了田一百一十余亩，地一百三十余亩（连自有田地现共有三百七十二亩）耕牛三头（连自有耕牛共八头），粮食八千余斤，生产积极性普遍提高。在向他们宣传了办农业合作社的好处后，他们普遍兴高采烈地说：“民主改革之后又办合作社，真是喜上加喜，双喜临门。”“两步合做一步，一步就可以走到社会主义社会，这多好啦！”“各家土地差不多，不要土地报酬也可以。”“按劳取酬，鼓励了劳动人民，又省了许多算账的麻烦。”
    建社后，首先解决了社员生产、生活上的困难：由国家给予各种贷款一千余元，共购买种子三千余斤，耕牛五头，口粮四千五百余斤，并无偿发放农具八十余件，帮助他们修了五间住房，买了必要的用具。经过社员讨论，拟定了大春作物增产百分之二十六的指标，找出了大力积肥和改进耕作技术这两个增产关键；并参照居住情况，便于领导和耕作的原则，划分了三个生产队，三个耕作区，采取了简单易行的办法，来安排活路和评工计分，改变了初期的混乱现象。这样，社员情绪日益饱满，劳动效率很高，比过去为奴隶主劳动约提高了一倍左右。建社后的二十三天内，积肥四百八十四挑，社内各项活路均较社外提前五至七天完成。今年合作社的庄稼不仅耕作及时，而且改进了某些耕作技术，生产收入大大超过了往年。全社约共可收入原粮八万五千余斤，副业收入四百余元，社员平均每人可收入粮食九百余斤，同去年相较，单位面积增产为百分之三十左右，社员较社外农民多收粮食约百分之三十七。同时，社员间密切的集体耕作，不仅增加了生产，而且还更进一步地加强了民族团结。因此，南坪社在附近农民中威信很高。该社所在的一百二十户人的自然村内，已全部参加了互助组，越来越多的贫苦劳动人民要求入社，而附近的初级社有的亦要求早日转高级社。南坪社已形成了团结群众走社会主义道路的旗帜。
    从南坪社的实例看，在解放了的奴隶群众中直接办高级形式的合作社是需要的，也是可能的，但是困难也是不少的。主要的困难是彝族文化很落后，文字也还在创造中，较完备的经营管理制度不容易在短时期内建立起来。因此，在彝区办社，必须从当地群众的要求和条件出发，一方面要根据解放后的奴隶无法单干、适宜于集体生产的特点，积极组织他们参加到农业合作社内来；另一方面，应当采取简便易行的建社、办社的制度和办法，在相当时期内合作社宜小不宜大，社规宜简不宜繁，并且特别要帮助他们解决文化落后的困难，这样来逐步地加以改进和提高。我们相信有了党中央的正确领导，又有了伟大祖国社会主义建设事业的辉煌成就，我们国家完全有条件根据凉山彝族的社会情况和需要，在政治、经济、文化和技术等方面给予大力帮助，使贫困落后的彝族社会通过合作化道路，越过封建社会和资本主义社会两个历史阶段直接过渡到社会主义社会，尽快地赶上先进民族的水平。
