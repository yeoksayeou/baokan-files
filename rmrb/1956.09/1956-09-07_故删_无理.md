    Unreasonable "Deliberate Deletion"
    Haimo
    In the newly published "Four Journeys" by the Shanghai Classical Literature Publishing House, the publisher's note states: "…In the 'Four Journeys,' there are several sections at the end regarding 'offerings,' 'abstinence,'... and 'Exhortations to Recite the Holy Name of the Xuan Emperor,' which are entirely Taoist methods of self-cultivation and incantations, unrelated to the main story. We have deleted them."

      The example of "deleted because it's unrelated to the main story" is not limited to this; this has become a very legitimate and popular viewpoint. In editorial reply letters, in opinions on film scripts, and in meetings discussing works, this view is always asserted confidently. According to this viewpoint, if "Dream of the Red Chamber" were written today, then the family banquets, weddings, funerals, dowries, gift lists, etc., within it would all have to be deleted. If the requirements were stricter, the long passage at the beginning describing the Land of Illusion would also have to be deleted. If stricter still, Jia Yucun and Zhen Shiyin would also be "unrelated to the main story" and should be deleted. After deleting to the end, the summary of the book could be written like this: "The author clearly exposes the evils of feudal families..."

    Apart from the reasons of the writers themselves, this popular viewpoint in recent demands on literature is an important reason why many works have been revised to be dry and simple.

    Fortunately, "Dream of the Red Chamber" has been preserved by the people, fortunately those descriptions unrelated to the main story were not deleted, so we can see the entire Chinese feudal society from this work, see a comprehensive picture of society, and see descriptions of people's customs, era characteristics, and other aspects that cannot be found in history books. The reason Marx praised Balzac's works was precisely because he could see the living history of France from his works.

    Returning to the revision work of "Four Journeys," aren't these "offerings" and "abstinence" precisely reflecting the once popular Taoist life in that society? Can't people today learn from this how the Taoists of the past in China lived? Where is the reason for such "deliberate deletion"?

### “故删”无理

    “故删”无理
    海默
    上海古典文学出版社新出版的四游记中，出版说明上有这样的话：“……四游记后面有好几段‘设供’、‘忌食’……及‘玄帝圣号劝文’，完全是道家的修真方法和咒语，与正文故事没有关系，我们把它删去了。”
      “与正文故事没有关系，故删”的例子并不止于此，这已经是个很合法的流行观点了。在编辑部的复信中，在对电影剧本的意见中，在讨论作品的会议上，这种看法总是理直气壮的。依照这种观点，假若红楼梦是在今天写作的，那么其中的家宴、婚、丧、嫁、娶、礼品单等等都必须删去；要求严格些，作品开始的那一大段太虚幻境的描写也应删去；再严格一些，贾雨村、甄士隐也“与正文故事无关”，应该删去。删到最后，在书的内容提要上就可以这样写了：“作者明确地揭露了封建家庭的罪恶……”
    除了作家本身的原因之外，近年对文学的要求上这种流行的观点，是使很多作品改得枯燥简单的重要原因。
    幸而红楼梦被人民保存下来了，幸而没有删掉那些与正文故事没有关系的描写，所以我们才能从这部作品中看见整个的中国封建社会，看见一幅包罗无遗的社会图画，看见在史书中所找不到的有关人民习俗、时代特征等等各方面的描写。马克思所以称赞巴尔扎克的作品，正是因为可以从他的作品中看见活的法国历史。
    回到四游记的删改工作上，难道这些“设供”、“忌食”，不是恰恰可以反映在那个社会中盛行一时的道家生活吗？今天的人，不是可以从这里知道过去中国的道家是怎样生活的吗？这样“故删”的理由在哪里？
