Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 7th: On the morning of September 2nd, in a shady, flower-filled spot in the People's Park of Zhangjiakou City, sat an old man wearing sunglasses, with a ruddy complexion and a nearly foot-long silver beard.

    A People's Liberation Army officer asked him:

  "Old man, how old are you this year?" The old man was about to answer when a Young Pioneer, about eleven or twelve years old, sitting beside him, looked at the old man's kind face and whispered: "Grandpa is 119 years old this year, but he insists on saying he is 118, he's superstitious!" Unfortunately, the old man heard everything.

  "I'm old superstitious, you're young superstitious," the old man said with a smile as he hugged the Young Pioneer.

    The old man's name is Zhang Quan. He is still very healthy. The little friend wearing the red scarf said, "Grandpa walks very fast, if he really let loose, I would have to jog to keep up." The old man also has a good memory and eyesight. He can still recite some of the books he read a hundred years ago.

    The old man was born in Da Wangcheng, Wei County, Hebei Province, in the eighteenth year of the Daoguang reign of the Qing Dynasty. To make a living, he left his hometown at the age of seventeen and wandered alone on the grasslands of Inner Mongolia for a hundred years. Because he was old and had no relatives, the Zhangjiakou Municipal People's Committee took him in in 1953 and settled him in the quiet environment of the People's Park, providing him with all his living expenses so that he could spend his happy old age. Recently, the Municipal People's Committee also fitted him with dentures and provided him with eye-glasses.

    一百一十九岁老人的幸福晚年
    新华社保定7日电　9月2日上午，在张家口市人民公园里的一个绿树成荫、百花齐放的地方，坐着一位戴着墨镜、面色红润，颚下留有近尺长银须的老人。
    一位人民解放军军官问他：
  “老大爷，你今年多大年纪啦！”老人刚要回答，坐在他身边的一个十一、二岁的少先队员，望着老人慈祥的面孔低声说：“老爷爷今年一百一十九岁了，他偏偏要说一百一十八岁，还迷信呢！”不巧，这些话全被老人听到了。
  “我是老迷信，你是小迷信。”老人一面说着，一面笑呵呵的把这位少先队员搂在怀里。
    这位老人叫张全。现在身体还很健康。带红领巾的小朋友说：“老爷爷走起路来可快啦，如果放开步走，我还得小跑才能跟上。”这位老人的记忆力和视力也很好。一百年以前读过的书，他现在还能背诵出一些。
    老人是清朝道光十八年出生在河北省蔚县大王城的。为了生活，他十七岁就离开家乡，在内蒙古的草原上孤身奔波了百来年。因为他年老又没有亲人，张家口市人民委员会在1953年把他接来安置在人民公园这个幽静的环境里，供给他全部生活费用，让他度过幸福的晚年。最近，市人民委员会还为他镶牙，配养目眼镜。
