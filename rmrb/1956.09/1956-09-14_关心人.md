　　As soon as we arrived at the mine, we heard the story of Li Wenguang. Just as he himself said, "The tiger doesn't eat people, but his reputation precedes him."

　　In the entire 301 Team, Li Wenguang's backwardness was well-known. Since 1953, he had been transferred to three mining areas, four types of work, eight units, and sixty-two groups. In a word, in a mine spanning dozens of miles and an exploration team of several thousand people, he had been everywhere except the leading organs. However, no place wanted him, and he couldn't stay in any place for long. In the end, it came down to taking a salary without working. He didn't meet the conditions for being fired, and he didn't want to go home. It dragged on like this until April of this year, when the entire mine launched an advanced producer movement.

　　In the Second Mining Area, at Tianbao Mountain, there was an advanced production group led by Chen Xingqi. In March, a representative assembly of pit exploration workers was held, calling for a comprehensive socialist labor competition. His group didn't have enough people, so he went to the sub-team headquarters to ask for some.

　　"We do have people," the personnel section cadre told him, "but I'm afraid you won't want them."

　　"Who is it?" Chen Xingqi asked.

　　"Li Wenguang!"

　　"Li Wenguang?" Chen Xingqi pondered. The image of this young man immediately surfaced in his mind. He looked like a young, strong, and capable young man, not like a lazy or muddled person. But he was backward! The famous "King of Absentees"; some people simply called him "Chief Absentee Li!" No one wanted him; those who had taken him couldn't get rid of him. And I'm supposed to be an advanced group now...

　　The personnel section cadre, watching Chen Xingqi's thoughtful expression, knew he was in a dilemma: take him, and he was really worried; don't take him, and there was no one else. So he honestly explained:

　　"What can we do? He's the only one left! We in personnel work, we don't have enough good people, and no one wants the bad ones! He's just occupying a position here. Don't worry about affecting your advanced group, just take him!"

　　Chen Xingqi didn't answer immediately. After thinking for a while, he said:

　　"Alright, we'll take him."

　　To the personnel section cadre's surprise, Chen Xingqi actually agreed to take him.

　　"People," he continued, "aren't enemies. Can anyone really be hopelessly backward?"

　　"But you're an advanced group, Old Chen!" the personnel section cadre exclaimed. Maybe he was afraid of affecting his advanced group; maybe he was afraid he would go back on his word and come looking for trouble again.

　　"If we're really advanced," Chen Xingqi smiled and said, "we should be leading the backward ones!"

　　And so it was decided. The next day, the personnel section notified Li Wenguang to report to Chen Xingqi's group at Tianbao Mountain.

　　(II)
　　However, when I met Li Wenguang in the Second Sub-team Party General Branch office, he had already been transferred away from Chen Xingqi's group, but this time not because he was backward, but to become the production group leader in another group, and had even become an advanced producer.

　　According to the person in charge of the Second Sub-team, their sub-team had been lagging behind for two years. They had been unable to complete their tasks, burdened by backwardness, unable to breathe. According to statistics, the "backwardness" at the time accounted for 84.6% of all workers in the sub-team! The cadres didn't dare to take responsibility, thinking, "We're not afraid of failing to complete the task, we're afraid of accidents!" Some people even prepared "preparatory war records," recording the daily progress, quality, and accidents in detail, just in case something happened, so they could "explain" themselves. Many people lost confidence and requested to be transferred to other sub-teams. And the leading cadres thought this was "serious individualism and insufficient socialist enthusiasm!"

　　It wasn't until April of this year, when the entire mine launched the advanced producer movement, especially after the transformation of Li Wenguang, that the situation in the entire sub-team changed accordingly.

　　However, I have never been very interested in this kind of "backward transformation" story. Although it has long been an important subject matter for literary works of our era; and it seems that not writing like this is not enough to show our era, nor enough to show the progress of the author.

　　I do believe what Chen Xingqi said to the personnel section: Who is willing to be backward! As long as they are not enemies. Maybe we need to add: And, precisely because we are in this era.

　　Sure enough, when Li Wenguang walked into the General Branch office, he was a surprisingly handsome young man. It's just that between his eyebrows, there was still an expression that was too shrewd and not honest enough.

　　Perhaps it was because he was wary of our visit that he revealed such an emotion. This can also be seen from his other expressions: he didn't smoke the cigarettes offered to him; he didn't drink the tea offered to him; he just looked around at everyone present with bright eyes.

　　Seeing this situation, I had to think of a way to make the conversation go smoothly. So I went straight to the point and said:

　　"We know all about your story. Just as you yourself said: The tiger doesn't eat people, but his reputation precedes him! Now, I just want to hear your own opinion."

　　The so-called "a word to the wise is enough." He looked straight into my eyes, as if to confirm his own judgment of what I said. Sure enough, he wasn't stupid, this sentence worked, dispelling his wariness. He smiled knowingly, took a sip of tea, lit a cigarette, and began to talk non-stop.

　　"I wasn't always backward," he began his conversation with a tone like a child pouting: "When I first came to the mine, I was only nineteen years old, that was in 1952. I carried small burdens and sold cakes. The capital was cheated by others and I couldn't go home, that's why I became a worker."

　　Listening to him, I thought to myself: No wonder, he was used to being lazy as a petty merchant, and he couldn't stand being a miner!

　　"If I didn't carry small burdens, what else could I do?" he continued, as if he could see through my mind. "My family is poor peasant. At that time, Yunnan had just been liberated, and we hadn't had land reform yet, and we didn't have land. What else could I do?"

　t I just think about it, and didn't say anything, but his words were like arguing with me! This young man is really something!

　　"In 1952, when I first came to the mine, I wasn't advanced, but I wasn't considered backward either. At first, I just wasn't used to the life in the mine, and I missed home—I think I wasn't the only one who had this problem at that time. You know, there are a lot of new workers here, all just coming from the countryside, how could they avoid it?..."

　　This young man is really shameless, he's actually defending himself! So I interrupted him unceremoniously and said:

　　"Let's not talk about these things, just tell me, how did you become backward!"

　　I didn't expect that, with just this one sentence, he stopped talking and looked straight at me. As if to say:

　　"Oh, so that's how you see people!"

　　But I ignored him and just kept scribbling on the paper, waiting for him to continue. For a long time, he didn't say anything; only then did I realize that something was wrong. I looked up, and he was still looking at me like that, as if he was measuring my value.

　　I saw that the conversation was about to stall, and I needed to quickly change my methods—as experienced reporters often do. So I deliberately lowered my voice, but secretly increased the pressure in my words, saying:

　　"Like this, Comrade Li Wenguang! You are now a production group leader, and an advanced producer. What is there to be embarrassed about about the past?"

　　Sure enough, this method worked: he had to open his mouth. But it was clear that his dissatisfaction had also increased.

　　So he said:

　　"Alright!" Even his voice carried a hint of annoyance. "If you only like to hear about people's backwardness, we have a lot to say!"

　　I didn't hear that this young man's words had an ulterior motive. On the contrary, I felt pleased and continued:

　　"Good, that's right, let's talk about these things.………”

　　I don't know why, but he suddenly sighed, looked at me as if he felt sorry for someone, and then suddenly raised his voice and quickly said:

　　"In April 1954, Secretary Chang—he was the shift pit leader at the time—reprimanded me; I said to him, stop selling quack medicine! He randomly labeled me, saying that I was: scolding the Party!—Can he represent the Party? He broke up our group and turned it into a reserve class. From then on, I never had a proper job.……"

　　He spoke quickly, then suddenly stopped, as if he had already finished speaking. Looking at his aggrieved and reasonable appearance, I couldn't help but feel a little angry—you're backward yourself, you don't do a proper job, but you have a reason to complain about others! So I said:

　　"That's not right! Why didn't you do a proper job?"

　　"It's a reserve class, where is there a proper job to do!"

　　"Then you take the salary for nothing, you don't do a proper job, are you worthy of the country?"

　　"Humph!" Who knew he would sneer! "They assigned me to carry electric poles, I didn't go—I'm a fourth-grade worker after all! The personnel section wouldn't give me money. Then they told me to boil water, and I refused even more!"

　　He was still pouting, still angry. Looking at him like that, I felt both angry and amused, and I couldn't help but say:

　　"You are really difficult!"

　　"The difficult part is still to come!" he said, still indifferent. "There was no way, they had to call me back into the cave to push the slag, with two new workers. The new workers couldn't push it, so I said they were only good for eating, not for working, and we argued—look, even the new workers are bullying me? I couldn't stand it, so I pushed him; they said I hit him and reported it—a person's name is like the shadow of a tree, my reputation is bad—the tiger doesn't eat people, but his reputation precedes him, the superiors only listened to them, and I was given a major demerit and demoted!"

　　I also felt that the punishment seemed heavy, but I didn't completely believe his words. So I asked:

　　"Did you hit someone?"

　　"Would I dare to hit someone?" he asked back. "My temper is bad, that's true. I can't win with words, I just pushed him."

　　"That's still your fault!" I said. Thinking about the kind of situation we often encounter, only looking at the attitude, not the facts.

　　But he didn't say anything, and lowered his head.

　　"What happened later? Keep talking." I don't know why, but my voice suddenly became much more peaceful. My curiosity and contempt for him gradually disappeared; I felt more and more bored.

　　"Later," he also became more peaceful. "I was transferred to Peng Zhenggui's group. Everyone here is from the same hometown, and they're familiar with each other. No one looks down on me, and I feel at ease. I worked well, and the group leader suggested that I do drilling. From October 1954 to April 1955, for more than half a year, nothing happened. Later, I even became the group leader."

　　"You even became the group leader?" I didn't know if I was surprised or happy for him, so I interjected.

　　"Yes, I became the group leader." He casually agreed, a smile floating on his face, joy in his voice, and hope seeming to flash in his eyes.

　　"Then you should work hard." I sighed in relief.

　　"Alas!" He also sighed. That sigh was gloomy, even painful. He lowered his head and didn't say anything.

　　According to the information I knew, his story wasn't over yet. But I didn't know that he had once improved and became a group leader. So I felt a little strange about his later situation. (To be continued)

    关心人
    方纪
    （一）
    一到矿山，我们就听到李文广的故事。正像他自己说的：“老虎不吃人，闻名在外”。
    在整个三○一队，李文广的落后是出名了。从1953年以来，他先后调动了三个矿区，四个工种，八个单位，六十二个小组。一句话，方圆几十里的一座矿山，好几千人的一个勘探队，除了领导机关，没有他不曾呆过的地方。但是，没有哪个地方愿意要他；也没有哪个地方他能呆得长。最后，弄到干拿工资不做活。开除，不够条件；回家，他还不愿意。就这样，一直拖到今年4月，整个矿山展开了先进生产者运动以后。
    第二矿区的天宝山有个先进生产组，组长叫陈兴启。3月间开了坑探职工代表大会，要全面展开社会主义劳动竞赛，他这个组人不够，便找到分队部去要。
    “人倒有，”人事科的干部对他说，“就怕你不要。”
    “谁呢？”陈兴启问。
    “李文广！”
    “李文广？”陈兴启沉吟了。脑子里立刻浮起这个青年的影子。看起来，这个小伙子年青力壮，精明强干，怎么也不像个懒人，糊涂人。但就是落后！有名的“旷工大王”；有的人干脆叫他“李旷长”！谁也不愿意要；要了的想推还推不出来。而我这里，现在又是个先进组。……
    人事科的干部看着陈兴启那副沉思的样子，知道他为难了：要吧，真担心；不要吧，又没有人。便老老实实地解释说：
    “有什么办法呢？就剩了这样的！我们做人事工作的，好人不够，不好的没有人要！在我们这里也是占编制，不怕影响你这个先进组，就领走吧！”
    陈兴启当时没有答话。想了一会才说：
    “好吧，我们要。”
    出乎人事科这位干部意料之外地，陈兴启居然同意要了。
    “人嘛，”他接着说，“又不是敌人，还有死落后的？”
    “你可是个先进组呀，老陈！”人事科的这位干部叫起来了。也许是怕影响他这个先进组；也许是怕他事后反悔，又来找麻烦。
    “要真是先进嘛，”陈兴启笑了笑说，“就该带动落后的哩！”
    于是，就这样决定了。第二天，人事科通知李文广，到天宝山陈兴启小组去上班。
    （二）
    但是，当我在第二分队党总支办公室见到李文广的时候，他已经又调离开陈兴启小组，但这回不是因为落后，却是到另一个小组去当生产组长了，而且还成了先进生产者。
    据第二分队的负责人告诉我：他们这个分队已经落后了二年。一直完不成任务，背着落后包袱，压得喘不过气来。据统计，当时的“落后面”竟占这个分队全体工人的84.6％！干部呢，不敢负责任，认为“不怕完不成任务，就怕出事故！”有的人还准备下了“预备战役录”，把每天的进度、质量、事故的详细情况一一记录下来，万一有事，好有个“交代”。不少人丧失了信心，要求调到别的分队去。而领导干部，还认为这是“个人主义思想严重，社会主义干劲不足！”
    直到今年4月，全矿山开展了先进生产者运动，其中特别是李文广的转变发生以后，整个分队的情况也随之改变了。
    但是，我一向对于这种“落后转变”的事不大有兴趣。虽然他早已成了我们这个时代文艺作品的重要题材；而且好像不这样写便不足以表现我们这个时代，也不足以表现作者的进步似的。
    我倒是相信陈兴启对人事科说的话：一个人嘛，谁甘心落后呢！只要不是敌人。也许还需要补充一句：而且，正是因为在我们这个时代。
    果然，李文广走进总支办公室的时候，竟是一个出乎我意料之外的漂亮的青年。只是在他的眉目间，还有一种过于精明、不够老实的表情。
    也许是因为他对于我们的访问有所戒备，才透露了这样的情绪。这从他另外的表现也可以看出来：给烟，他不抽；给茶，他不喝；只是目光炯炯环顾着所有在场的人。
    看到这种情形，我不得不想一点办法，以便使谈话进行得顺利。于是便开门见山地说：
    “你的事情，我们都知道了。正像你自己说的：老虎不吃人，闻名在外！现在，只是想听一听你自己的意见。”
    所谓“聪明人一点就透”。他把眼睛对直地看着我，像要从我的眼睛里证实他自己对我这话的判断。果然，他当真不笨，这句话发生了效力，消除了他的戒备。他会心似地笑了笑，喝一口茶，点起烟来，便滔滔不绝地说下去。
    “我也不是从来就落后的。”他用一种像是小孩子呕气般的口气开始了他的谈话：“刚到矿上的时候，我才十九岁，那是1952年。我挑小担，卖饼子，本钱给人家骗了，回不得家，我才当工人的。”
    一面听着，我心里想：怪不得，小商小贩，懒散惯了，当矿工，那里受得了呢！
    “我不挑小担，又怎么办呢？”他像是看透了我的心里一样，紧接着说。“家是贫农，那时云南解放不久，我们这里还没有土地改革，又没有地，怎么办呢？”
    我只不过心里想了想，又没有开腔，他的话却像是同我辩论一样！这小伙子，可真厉害哩！
    “1952年，刚到矿上时，不先进吧，也还不算落后。起初只是不习惯矿上的生活，想家——我看，那时候有这毛病的，也不光我一个。你知道，这里是新工人多，都是刚从农村来的，免得了吗？……”
    这小伙子可真不害臊，居然为自己辩护起来了！于是我便不客气地打断他的话说：
    “不谈这些吧，只说，你怎么落后的！”
    那想，只这么一句，他不开腔了，把眼睛对直地看着我。像是说：
    “哦，原来你也是这样看人的！”
    我却没有理会，只顾低着头在纸上乱划，等他继续往下说。好半天，他都不作声；我才发觉情况不对。抬起头来，他还在那样子地看着我，好像是在估量我这个人的价值。
    我看谈话要僵，需要赶紧改变方式方法——像一般有经验的记者所常用的。于是故意放平了声音，但话里却暗暗增加了压力，说：
    “这样，李文广同志！你现在已经是生产组长了，又是先进生产者，过去了的事，还有什么不好意思呢？”
    果然，这方法发生了效力：他不得不开口了。但看得出来一点：他的不满也更增加了。
    于是他说：
    “好吧！”连声音里也带得出一丝烦意。“你要专喜欢听人家的落后事，我们是有得说的呢！”
    我倒没有听出来，这小伙子话里有话。反自以为得计地接着说：
    “好嘛，这就对了嘛，就谈这些。………”
    不知怎么，他忽然叹一口气，好像可怜谁似的望望我，却突然提高了声音，迅速地说道：
    “1954年4月，常支书——那时他还是值班坑长，训了我；我说他一句，少卖狗皮膏药吧！他就给我乱扣帽子，说我这是：谩骂党！——他能代表党吗？把我们的小组编散，编成预备班。从此，我就再没有正经活干。……”
    他急速地说着，又突然停下来，像是已经说完了。我看着他那又委屈，又有理的样子，不由得有点生气——你自己落后，不正经干活，倒有理由埋怨别人了！便说：
    “你这就不对了！为什么不正经干活呢？”
    “预备班嘛，哪里有正经活干！”
    “那你白拿工资，不正经干活，对得起国家吗？”
    “哼！”谁知他倒冷笑了一声！“分配我去抬电杆，我不去——我好歹是个四级工人哪！人事科就不发钱了。又叫我去烧水，我更不干了！”
    他仍然噘着嘴，气呼呼地。我看着他那样子，又好气，又好笑，不由得说：
    “你倒是真难缠！”
    “难缠的还在后面呢！”他说，仍然是满不在乎的样子。“没有办法，他们只好又叫我进洞，推渣子，和两个新工人一起。新工人推不动，我就说他们管吃不管用，争吵起来——你看，连新工人也欺负我了？我气不过，推了他一把；他们就说我打了他，告上去——人的名，树的影，我是名声不好——老虎不吃人，闻名在外，上面光听他们的，就给我记了一大过，还降一级！”
    我也觉得这处分好像是重了，但又不完全相信他的话。便问：
    “你没有打人吗？”
    “我还敢打人吗？”他却反问了一句。“我脾气不好，是真的。嘴说不过，只推了一把。”
    “那也是你的不对！”我说。想到我们常常遇到的这类情形，只看态度，不看事实。
    他却不吭气，低下头去。
    “后来呢？说下去吧。”我不知怎么，声音一下子平和多了。对他的好奇和轻视心理，也逐渐消失了；觉得越来越兴味索然。
    “后来，”他也变得平和了些。“把我调到彭正贵小组。这里都是同乡，人熟，没有人看不起我，我也就安心了。工作得不坏，组长提意见，又叫我打钻。从1954年10月，到1955年4月，半年多，没有发生过事情，后来，还当了小组长。”
    “还当了小组长？”我不知道是自己奇怪，还是替他高兴，随口插了一句。
    “是呵，当了组长。”他随口答应，脸上浮起笑容，声音里透着欢喜，眼睛里仿佛也闪出了希望。
    “那你可该好好干了。”我放心地叹了口气。
    “唉！”他也叹了口气。那叹气却是愁闷的、甚至苦痛的低下头，又不作声了。
    按照我所知道的材料，他的故事还没有完。但我却不知道，这中间，他还曾一度好转过，当了组长。于是对他后来的情形，便觉得有点奇怪了。（未完）
