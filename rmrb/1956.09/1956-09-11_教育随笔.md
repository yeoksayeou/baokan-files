Educational Essays

    In Shanghai's Yi Miao District, an elementary school teacher requested housing allocation from the housing administration bureau. The cadre from the housing administration bureau replied, "Even if there are vacant houses, it won't be the turn of you elementary school teachers."
    In Chongqing's Shapingba elementary school, some teachers who originally lived in the school were forced to move out according to the "instructions" of the Culture and Education Bureau; the real estate management department rented the houses to people who sell chicken and duck eggs instead.
    Disrespecting elementary school teachers is a chronic illness left over from the old society, and it is far from being cured to this day.
    Teacher training schools have difficulty recruiting students every year, and middle school teachers always have to do a lot of mobilization and persuasion work to "get through" the "thinking" of middle school graduates. I think the more important ideological work should be to require all sectors of society to universally cultivate a new fashion of respecting teachers!
    The phenomenon of randomly pulling elementary school teachers for other tasks is still very serious in various places. Teachers are required to promote newspapers and periodicals for post offices and bookstores, to engage in savings for the People's Bank, and even to guard warehouses, deliver letters, and cook meals. When the Qin County Livestock Company in Guangdong purchased duck feathers, it also required elementary school teachers to conduct two weeks of promotion for them.
    Those who randomly pull elementary school teachers all have a set of reasons, saying that their work is of utmost importance.
    Those who randomly pull teachers all have a set of reasons, saying that they randomly pull teachers precisely out of respect for teachers.
    But the real reason is just to make themselves the "masters" of the teachers, "summoning them when needed and dismissing them at will," which is still a contempt for teachers.

    教育随笔
    叶秀
    上海市邑庙区有位小学教师，向房管局要求调配房屋。房管局的干部答道：“房子就是有空也轮不着你们小学教师。”
    重庆市沙坪坝小学有些教师，原来住在学校里的，根据文教科的“指示”，被逼搬出学校；由房地产管理部门把房子另租给卖鸡鸭蛋的人居住。
    轻视小学教师是旧社会留下的恶疾，至今还远远未能治愈。
    师范学校每年招生困难，总要有劳中学教师做许多动员、说服工作，“打通”中学毕业生的“思想”。我觉得，更重要的思想工作，应该是要求社会各界，普遍培植起尊敬教师的新的风尚！
    各地乱拉小学教师的现象还是很严重。要教师为邮局、书店推销报刊，要教师为人民银行搞储蓄、甚至要教师守仓库、送信、做饭。广东钦县畜产公司收购鸭毛，也要小学教师为他们进行两星期的宣传。
    乱拉小学教师的人都有一套理由，说他们的工作头等重要。
    乱拉教师的人都有一套理由，说他们乱拉教师，就为的尊敬教师。
    但是真实的理由却不过是让自己来做教师的“老爷”，“呼之即来，挥之即去”，依然是对于教师的轻视。
