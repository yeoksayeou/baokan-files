Xinhua News Agency, Tel Aviv, September 14th: TASS reported from Tel Aviv on September 14th: The Political Bureau of the Israeli Communist Party issued a statement on September 14th regarding the tense situation on the borders between Israel and Arab countries, pointing out that Israel should not become a whip used by imperialism to deal with its neighbors. The Israeli people are unwilling, and should not, pull chestnuts out of the fire for the British, French, and American billionaires.

The statement said, "The rulers of Britain, France, and the United States are attempting to use the Arab-Israeli conflict to achieve their own sinister goals. The imperialists want to use Israel again as a tool to exert pressure on Egypt. Western countries are instigating Israel to carry out military adventures against its Arab neighbors."

The statement said, "Israel should guarantee its freedom of navigation in the Suez Canal through negotiations and agreements with Egypt. Israel should support the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company and oppose the imperialist military plans against Egypt. Only in this way can it lay the foundation for promoting negotiations and agreements."

The statement called on the Israeli people to struggle against all attempts to drag Israel into a bloody conflict with its neighbors.

    以色列人民不愿为英美法火中取栗
    以共谴责帝国主义煽动对埃及的军事冒险阴谋
    新华社15日讯　据塔斯社特拉维夫14日讯：以色列共产党政治局9月14日就以色列和阿拉伯国家边境上的紧张局势发表一项声明指出，以色列不应该成为被帝国主义用来对付它的邻国的鞭子。以色列人民不愿意，也不应该为英国、法国和美国的亿万富翁去火中取栗。
    声明说，“英国、法国、美国的统治者企图利用阿拉伯—以色列冲突来达到自己的罪恶目的。帝国主义者又想利用以色列作为对埃及施加压力的工具。西方国家怂恿以色列对阿拉伯邻国进行军事冒险”。
    声明说，“以色列应该用同埃及谈判和取得协议的办法来保证获得在苏彝士运河的通航自由。以色列应该支持苏彝士运河公司国有化，反对帝国主义对埃及采取的军事计划，只有这样，才能打下基础来促进谈判和协议”。
    这项声明号召以色列人民进行斗争，反对把以色列拖进同邻国的流血冲突中去的一切企图。
