Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, September 2nd: Forty Japanese nationals and their families from seven provinces and cities in China returned home last night aboard the "Xing'an Maru."

Also on board the "Xing'an Maru" returning to Japan were thirty-seven criminal offenders and border crossers who had been detained since liberation. They were released early, exempted from prosecution, or deported this time.

The young cook, Maniwa Koya, from the Japanese Taiyo Fisheries Company's "Akashi Maru No. 139" fishing boat, who was rescued at sea, also returned home on the same ship.

Maniwa Koya fell into the sea while fishing near Hainan Island on May 4th with the "Akashi Maru No. 139" when he went into the water to retrieve a dropped rice bucket and was later rescued by Chinese fishermen.

Fifty-six Japanese women married to Chinese men and their eighty-one children, who were visiting relatives in China, also returned to Japan aboard the "Xing'an Maru."

Japanese woman Aizawa Etsuko and her baby, who came to China to visit relatives, also returned home by ship.
