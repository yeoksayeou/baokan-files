Santiago’s Most Popular Performance

On the evening of August 26th, in the Santiago Municipal Theater, amid warm applause and shouts of "Encore!", the Chinese artists took bows again and again. Finally, the curtain slowly closed. The Chinese Folk Art Troupe concluded its week-long performance in Chile.

This art troupe, visiting American countries, achieved success in its performances in Chile, the first country. Santiago newspapers considered the Chinese art troupe's "performance conquered the public" and became "the most popular performance in Santiago."

The art troupe performed nine shows at the Municipal Theater in downtown Santiago, all of which were sold out. All tickets were sold five days before the performance. Chilean theater professionals said that this was a rare phenomenon in Chile. Every day during the performances, Peking Opera, folk songs, dances, and instrumental music were welcomed. Every day in the theater's corridors, many audience members could be encountered, excitedly saying in short bursts: "Too beautiful," "Too wonderful," "Never seen anything like it," "What perfect structure!" "How rich and colorful!"... These days, the programs performed by the art troupe have become a hot topic of conversation among the people of Santiago.

Although Chinese and Chilean languages are different, this did not prevent the Chilean public from appreciating classical Chinese drama. Emotions in life do not require language to be conveyed. The Chilean magazine "Eva" said: "Peking Opera vividly expresses life, and the audience can understand everything the actors are portraying."

Chilean newspapers believe that the art troupe's performance is one of the most beautiful and perfect dramas ever performed in Santiago. Newspapers have published many reviews on the art troupe's performance.

"La Nación" said: "The performance conquered the public not only because of its glorious origin, but also because of the perfection and lightness of the performance, the splendor of the costumes, and the poetry that connects each episode."

"El Siglo" said: "Peking Opera integrates movement, mime, color, symbolism, music, and other elements, allowing them all to be richly developed."

The weekly "South Pacific Mail" said that Peking Opera's "perfect combination of drama, dance, farce, and music is something that Western artists have never achieved." The weekly also said that this "superb art will never be forgotten by Westerners."

The famous Chilean playwright and professor at the University of Chile, Pedro Otaes, published an article in the weekly "Lightning" saying that this true "dramatic drama" or "comprehensive drama" that integrates various stage skills is precisely the goal that Western playwrights have been seeking but have not yet achieved.

The Chinese Folk Art Troupe brought Chinese art and also brought the Chinese people's desire to promote friendship between China and Chile.

The art troupe had contact with people from all walks of life in Chile and received friendly receptions from all sides. Chilean President Ibáñez received the head and deputy head of the art troupe and watched the art troupe's performance in the president's private box at the Municipal Theater. The Chilean Minister of Foreign Affairs, Minister of Education, Minister of Interior, President of the Senate, and President of the Chamber of Deputies each received the head and deputy head of the art troupe. The President of the Chamber of Deputies, Julio Durán, also accompanied the head and members of the art troupe on a visit to the Chamber of Deputies meeting hall. Upon departure, he presented the art troupe with a small Chilean flag as a souvenir of the meeting.

The head and members of the art troupe met with famous figures in Chilean cultural and religious circles. The friendly meeting between the head of the troupe and the President of the University of Chile, Juan Gómez Millas, and the influential Cardinal José María Caro was highly valued by the Chilean press. The art troupe held several gatherings with the Chilean art and theater community in Santiago, introducing them to classical Chinese art and exchanging experiences in theater work.

During the days of the art troupe's stay in Chile, the people felt that we were living in the enthusiastic atmosphere of the Chilean people. On the streets, in the parks, in hotels and shops, ordinary Chileans could be encountered greeting us with smiles. People were happy to help the art troupe.

Shortly after the art troupe arrived here, when students from the University of Chile and the Catholic University held a soccer match commemorating the Chilean national hero O'Higgins, they invited the head and members of the art troupe to watch. Some members of the troupe were also invited to the center of the stadium where the soccer match was being held, received flowers, and were introduced to the more than 40,000 spectators.

During the performance, the President of the Chile-China Cultural Association, Allende, specially held a grand banquet with more than 400 people to entertain the art troupe. Famous poet Neruda, doctor Lipschütz, painter Lederer all came, as well as people from the literary and art circles and all walks of life. Many Chilean friends who had visited China came to the banquet wearing Chinese clothes and decorations. Friends performed Chilean folk songs and dances for us. The Chinese words "friendship" and "cheers" rose and fell in the venue. A gray-haired, famous Chilean music conductor said at the banquet: "How much I love China, I have endless words to say in my heart."

On the day the art troupe concluded its performance, Neruda invited the head of the art troupe and some members to his villa in Isla Negra on the Pacific coast for lunch. As soon as the guests arrived there, Neruda, wearing Chilean national costume, came out with his wife to greet them. He took the guests near the beach and shouted repeatedly towards the northwest, towards the Pacific: "China," "China,"... He said: "China is on the other side of the Pacific Ocean, I can see it, it can hear my voice." At Neruda's house, he was always talking and laughing, very happy. Neruda's wife personally cooked for us. After the meal, she sang a Chilean song, and Neruda and other Chilean friends sang along. Finally, when it was time to leave, Neruda and his wife drove us part of the way.

The overseas Chinese in Chile were very excited about the arrival of the art troupe. Northern Chile is a region with a large number of overseas Chinese, and dozens of people drove to Santiago this time to welcome us. They said that being able to see people from the motherland is happiness.

The art troupe will leave this city, which is backed by the beautiful Andes snow peaks, on August 28th. In the short ten days or so, we have met many old friends here, and at the same time, we have made many new friends. The sincerity and enthusiasm of the Chilean people, and the deep friendship of the Chilean friends, will remain in our hearts.

    圣地亚哥最得人心的演出
    新华社记者　万光
    8月26日晚间，在圣地亚哥市立剧院里，在热烈的掌声和“再来”的欢呼声中，中国艺术家们一再谢幕。最后帷幕徐徐地闭上了。中国民间艺术团结束了在智利为时一个星期的演出。
    这个到美洲国家访问的艺术团，在第一个国家——智利的演出获得了成功。圣地亚哥报纸认为，中国艺术团的“演出征服了公众”，成为“圣地亚哥最得人心的演出”。
    艺术团在圣地亚哥市中心的市立剧院演出了九场，场场客满。所有的票在演出前五天就卖完了。智利戏剧界人士说，这在智利是很少有的现象。在每天演出时，京剧、民间歌舞和乐器演奏，都受到欢迎。每天在剧院的走廊里都可以碰到许多观众，他们用短促的话语激动地说：“太美了”，“太奇妙了”，“从来没有看见过”，“结构是多么完美啊！”“多么丰富多采啊！”……。这些日子来，艺术团表演的节目已经成为圣地亚哥人们热烈谈论的话题。
    尽管中国和智利语言不通，但是这并没有妨碍智利公众欣赏中国的古典戏剧。生活中的感情原是不需要语言就可以传达的。智利“夏娃”画报说：“京剧活生生地表现了生活，观众可以理解演员们所表现的一切。”
    智利报纸认为，艺术团的演出是圣地亚哥演出过的最美丽、最完美的戏剧之一。报纸就艺术团演出发表了许多评论。
      “民族报”说：“演出征服公众的地方，不仅在于它的光辉的由来，而且在所表演的完美、轻巧，服装的华丽，还有连结着每一个情节的诗意。”
      “世纪报”说：“京剧把动作，哑剧、色彩、象征、音乐等因素都综合到一起了，使它们都得到了丰富的发挥。”
    周刊“南太平洋邮报”说：像京剧这样“完美地把戏剧，舞蹈，滑稽戏和音乐结合起来，这是西方艺术家从来没有达到过的。”这家周刊又说，这种“高超的艺术将永久不能为西方人所忘记”。
    智利著名的戏剧家，智利大学教授彼德罗·奥塔斯在“闪电”周刊上发表一篇文章说：这种综合各种舞台演技的真正的“戏剧性的戏剧”或者叫“全面戏剧”，正是西方戏剧家所寻求而至今未能达到的目标。
    中国民间艺术团带来了中国的艺术，也带来了中国人民促进智中两国友好的愿望。
    艺术团同智利各界人士进行了接触，受到了各方面的友好接待。智利总统伊巴?斯接见了艺术团正副团长，并且在市立戏院总统专有的包厢中看了艺术团的演出。智利外交部长、教育部长、内务部长、参议院议长、和众议院议长分别接见了艺术团正副团长。众议院议长胡利奥·杜兰还陪同艺术团团长和团员们参观了众议院会议厅。临别时，他送给艺术团一面小的智利国旗，作为纪念会见的礼物。
    艺术团团长和团员们会见了智利文化和宗教界的著名人士。团长同智利大学的校长胡安·戈梅斯—米亚斯和在智利很有影响的红衣大主教何塞·马里亚·卡里尔的友好会见，颇为智利报界所重视。艺术团在圣地亚哥同智利艺术戏剧界举行了多次聚会，向他们介绍了中国的古典艺术，并且交流了戏剧工作中的经验。
    在智利停留的日子里，艺术团的人们都感觉到，我们是生活在智利人民的热情气氛中。在街道上，在公园里，在旅馆和商店里，都可以碰到普通的智利人向我们打招呼，微笑。人们很乐意给艺术团帮个忙。
    艺术团刚到这里后不久，在智利大学和天主教大学学生举行纪念智利民族英雄奥里金斯的足球赛时，就邀请艺术团团长和团员们去观看。一部分团员们还被邀请到进行足球赛的运动场的中央，接受献花，并且介绍给全场四万多观众。
    在演出期间，智中文化协会主席阿伦德特地举行了一个有四百多人参加的盛大宴会，招待艺术团。著名诗人聂鲁达，医生利普舒茨，画家勒德勒里都来了，还有文艺界和各阶层的人士。许多访问过中国的智利朋友，穿着中国的服装，戴着中国的装饰来赴宴。朋友们为我们表演了智利的民间歌舞和舞蹈。会场上中国话“友好”，“干杯”的声音此起彼落。一个白发苍苍的智利著名音乐指挥在宴会上说：“我多么喜欢中国，我心里有说不完的话要说。”
    在艺术团结束演出的一天，聂鲁达邀请艺术团团长和一些团员们到他在太平洋海滨黑岛地方的别墅中去午餐。客人们一到那里，聂鲁达就穿着智利民族服装同他夫人一道出来迎接。他把客人们带到海滩附近，就朝着西北方向，向着太平洋一再地高喊：“中国”，“中国”，……。他说：“中国就在太平洋彼岸，我能够看到它，它能够听到我的声音。”在聂鲁达家里时，他一直谈笑风生，很高兴。聂鲁达夫人亲自为我们做菜招待。吃完饭，她高唱起智利歌来，聂鲁达和其他智利朋友们一道和唱。最后，离开的时候到了，聂鲁达和他夫人还乘汽车送了我们一程路。
    在智利的华侨们对艺术团来到十分兴奋。智利北部是华侨较多的地区，这次有几十人乘汽车赶来圣地亚哥欢迎我们。他们说，能看到祖国来的人，就是幸福。
    艺术团8月28日就要离开这个背依着美丽的安第斯雪峰的城市了。在短促的十来天里，我们在这里遇到了许多老朋友，同时更结识了许多新朋友。智利人民的真诚热情，智利朋友的深厚友谊，将留在我们的心里。
