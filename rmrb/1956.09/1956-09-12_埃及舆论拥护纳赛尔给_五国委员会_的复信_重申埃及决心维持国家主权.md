    Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 11th - The "Al-Ahram" of September 10th stated: "The Egyptian people will absolutely not allow any foreign country to participate in the management of the canal. No force in the world can manage the canal against the will of the Egyptian people and without their cooperation."

    The newspaper's editorial wrote: "If the Western Big Three were a little smarter, they would not have sent a committee to Cairo to present Egypt with these proposals that Egypt has already decisively rejected."

    The "People's Gazette" editorial said that Egyptian President Nasser's reply to the "Five-Nation Committee" was characterized by frankness, courage, and prudence. It said: "Frankness, because Nasser did not let himself be intimidated by threats; courage, because Nasser has clearly shown the Western countries that Egypt is willing to fight if attacked; prudence, because Egypt clearly does not want war, it merely wants to protect its rights as an independent nation."

    埃及舆论拥护纳赛尔给“五国委员会”的复信
    重申埃及决心维持国家主权
    新华社11日讯　开罗消息：9月10日的“金字塔报”说：“埃及人民绝对不允许任何外国参加管理运河，世界上没有任何力量能够在违背了埃及人民的意愿和得不到埃及人民的合作的情况下来管理运河”。
    这家报纸的社论写道：“如果西方三大国这帮人稍微聪明一点的话，他们就不会派一个委员会到开罗来向埃及提出这些早已为埃及断然拒绝了的建议”。
    “人民报”的社论说，埃及总统纳赛尔给“五国委员会”的答复具有坦率、勇敢和稳健的特点。它说：“坦率，是因为纳赛尔没有让自己被威胁所吓倒；勇敢，是因为纳赛尔显然已经向西方国家表明埃及在遭到攻击时不惜一战；稳健，是因为埃及显然并不希望战争，它仅仅是为了要保护它作为一个独立国家的权利”。
