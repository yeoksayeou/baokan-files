Xinhua News Agency report: According to statistics from the Gansu Provincial Planning Commission, the number of ethnic minority students entering schools at all levels throughout the province this year has increased from more than 48,700 last year to more than 83,000. The Northwest Nationalities Institute, which has students from 14 ethnic groups, has enrolled more new students this year than the total number of students previously enrolled.

Of the more than 34,300 new ethnic minority students enrolled this year, more than 1,700 are attending universities, more than 1,500 are attending ordinary middle schools and teacher training schools, and more than 31,100 are attending primary schools.

The vast majority of these ethnic minority students are children of farmers and herdsmen from the Hui areas of Wuzhong, Guyuan, and Linxia, as well as the Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Gannan, the Mongolian Autonomous County of Subei, the Yugu Autonomous County of Sunan, the Dongxiang Autonomous County, and the Aksai Kazakh Autonomous County. The number of children from the Kazakh, Dongxiang, Salar, and Bao'an ethnic groups, who rarely attended school in the past, has also increased significantly this year.

In order to accommodate the increase in the number of ethnic minority students, Gansu Province has newly established six ethnic middle schools and more than eighty ethnic primary schools this year. Including the existing ethnic schools, there are now a total of twenty-four ethnic middle schools and teacher training schools, and more than seven hundred primary schools run in ethnic areas throughout the province.

    新华社讯　据甘肃省计划委员会统计，今年全省进入各级学校学习的少数民族学生，由去年的四万八千七百多名增加到了八万三千多名。有十四种民族学生的西北民族学院，今年招收的新生比原有在校学生总数增加了一倍以上。
    今年新招收的三万四千三百多名少数民族学生中，进高等学校上学的有一千七百多名，进普通中学和师范学校上学的一千五百多人，进小学上学的三万一千一百多人。
    这些少数民族学生绝大多数是吴忠、固原、临夏等回族地区和甘南藏族自治州、肃北蒙古族自治县、肃南裕固族自治县、东乡族自治县、阿克塞哈萨克族自治县等民族地区的农民和牧民的子弟。过去上学很少的哈萨克、东乡、撒拉、保安等民族的儿童今年也显著增加。
    为了适应少数民族学生上学人数增加，甘肃省今年新创办了民族中学六所和民族小学八十多所，加上原有民族学校，现在全省共有民族中学和师范学校二十四所，民族地区举办的小学七百多所。
