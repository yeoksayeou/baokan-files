Xinhua News Agency, 16th: The Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China continued its session at 2:00 PM today.

    Today's agenda included Comrade Deng Xiaoping's report "On Revising the Party Constitution" and Comrade Zhou Enlai's report "On the Proposal for the Second Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy."

    Today's executive chairmen of the congress were: Li Xiannian, Wu Yuzhang, Chen Yi, Chen Yu, Ke Qingshi, Ouyang Qin, Ma Mingfang, Zhang Dingcheng, Cai Chang.

    In his "Report on Revising the Party Constitution," Deng Xiaoping first pointed out that since the Seventh National Congress of the Party, a series of glorious victories have indisputably proven the correctness of the political and organizational lines laid down by the Seventh National Congress of the Party.

    He said that this draft of the Party Constitution, compared with the Party Constitution adopted by the Seventh Congress, does not have any fundamental differences in principle. However, there have been many changes in specific content, including some changes of a principled nature.

    Deng Xiaoping then analyzed the conditions under which this revision of the Party Constitution was based, focusing on the issues of the Party's mass line, the Party's democratic centralism, the Party's unity and unification, raising the standards for Party members and safeguarding their rights, and the Party's organizational structure in the draft of the Party Constitution. He said that after the draft of the Party Constitution is discussed and adopted by this congress, it will become a powerful weapon for further improving the quality of the Party, expanding inner-Party democracy, promoting the political enthusiasm of Party members, improving the Party's organizational work, and strengthening the Party's unity, unification, and combat effectiveness.

    Deng Xiaoping's report was more than 29,000 words long and lasted two hours and fifteen minutes. His report was repeatedly interrupted by warm applause.

    The representatives listened with great interest to Zhou Enlai's report on "Proposals for the Second Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy."

    Zhou Enlai called on the entire Party to work harder in the coming year or so, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, together with the workers, peasants, and intellectuals of the whole country, together with all nationalities, parties, and patriotic people in the country, to strive to overfulfill the First Five-Year Plan and actively prepare for the Second Five-Year Plan.

    Before explaining the proposals for the Second Five-Year Plan, Zhou Enlai talked about the basic situation of the implementation of the First Five-Year Plan and put forward some opinions on several more prominent issues that have been felt in leading economic work in recent years.

    Next, Zhou Enlai talked about the basic tasks of the Second Five-Year Plan and briefly explained the main issues of the Second Five-Year Plan proposals. These issues are: rationally accumulating and allocating funds, correctly arranging the basic construction plan, developing industrial and agricultural production, developing the transportation and postal and telecommunications industries, strengthening commercial work, enterprise reorganization and personnel arrangements in the process of socialist transformation, improving the national administrative system, giving play to the enthusiasm of local areas, cultivating construction talents and strengthening scientific research work, further improving people's lives and continuing to practice thrift and strive for international support, and expanding international economic, technical, and cultural cooperation and ties.

    Zhou Enlai's report was about 32,000 words long. When he gave the report, warm applause rang out from the audience from time to time.

    Today's meeting ended at 7:40 PM. The meeting will continue tomorrow afternoon.

    周恩来号召全党，在今后一年多的时间里，应该在党的中央委员会和毛泽东同志的领导下，加倍努力，同全国工人、农民、知识分子一起，同全国各民族、各党派、一切爱国人士一起，为超额完成第一个五年计划和积极准备第二个五年计划而奋斗。
    周恩来在说明第二个五年计划的建议以前，谈到了关于执行第一个五年计划的基本情况，并就近年来在领导经济工作中间所感到的几个比较突出的问题，提出了一些意见。
    接着，周恩来谈到了第二个五年计划的基本任务，并扼要地说明了第二个五年计划建议的主要问题，这些问题是：合理地积累和分配资金、正确地安排基本建设计划、发展工业和农业生产、发展运输业和邮电业、加强商业工作、社会主义改造过程中的企业改组和人员安排、改进国家行政体制，发挥地方的积极性、培养建设人材和加强科学研究工作、进一步改善人民生活和继续厉行节约和争取国际支援，扩大国际间经济、技术和文化的合作和联系。
