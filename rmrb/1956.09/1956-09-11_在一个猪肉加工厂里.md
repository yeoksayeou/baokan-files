    In a Pork Processing Factory
    By our reporters Yu Ming and Wu Rongjiang
    It was already four o'clock in the afternoon when we arrived at the newly built Anhui Province Bengbu Meat Joint Processing Factory. The comrades in the factory still warmly accompanied us to the workshop for a tour.
    The factory area is very large. We originally planned to start from the raw material area, that is, the pig storage warehouse. But on the way to the raw material area, we heard someone say that production was fast today, and only dozens of live pigs were left in the slaughterhouse. In order to see how pigs were slaughtered, we went to visit the place where pigs were slaughtered first. Sure enough, there were only twenty or so pigs left in the waiting pen. The pigs were very fat, desperately squeezing into the corners of the wall. Engineer Chen Xuexi said to us: "Before slaughtering, the pigs are washed." At this time, we took a closer look and found that there were many water sprayers overhead, and each pig was washed clean. Strangely, we stayed in the slaughtering area for a long time, but we didn't hear a single pig squeal. We only saw the workers holding something like a hair dryer in a barbershop, touching the head of the live pig. After a few seconds, the pig that had been scrambling around slowly fell to the ground. The pig was electrocuted, and the elevator quickly lifted it away. After about a minute, before the pig was fully awake, a sharp knife pierced its throat. Before the end of get off work, the slaughterhouse workers completed their day's task. On this day, they slaughtered eight hundred pigs.
    This factory not only washes the pigs very clean before slaughtering, but also conducts strict inspections of the pork after slaughtering. Those who do inspection work are very skilled. They can tell at a glance whether it is a good pig or a bad pig when they get a piece of pork. Some of them inspect the neck of the pig, some inspect the meat for food, and some inspect the internal organs of the pig. The pork quickly divided into several grades after it passed through their hands. The meat that can leave the factory is transported to the freezing workshop; some can only be rendered into oil and are placed separately. Li Haowen, the director of the factory office, said to us: "Most of these inspectors are recent junior high school graduates. They have not been working for a long time, but they have learned a very high level of skill." We saw a lab technician who discovered Trichinella under a microscope. She wanted us to see it and said, "Pork with Trichinella will be processed separately in the factory. It is harmful to the body to eat pork with parasites." This factory has to go through eight inspection checkpoints from raw pigs to frozen meat. The inspectors have a high sense of responsibility and only allow the meat to leave the factory if it meets the specifications. Just looking at this pork, we feel that it is more delicious than ordinary pork.
    This meat joint processing factory has cooling and quick-freezing workshops, as well as cold storage warehouses. We went in wearing cotton clothes and cotton coats. In the quick-freezing workshop and cold storage, the temperature is minus eighteen degrees Celsius. The hundreds of pork strips hanging in the quick-freezing workshop were all slaughtered the day before. The engineer said: "Minus eighteen degrees is not the lowest temperature. After a few hours, the temperature will drop to minus twenty-three to thirty degrees." We flicked the pork with our hands, and the pork was frozen hard. The engineer said: "This kind of pork can be stored in cold storage and places with cooling equipment for several years without spoiling. No matter where it is transported, it tastes the same as fresh pork when taken out for cooking." Walking out of the quick-freezing workshop, the comrades who accompanied us on the tour happily said: "Since the end of August, the frozen meat we produce has been exported in large quantities. Our frozen meat can be exchanged for 4.7 tons of steel per ton when exported. Therefore, some of our workers proudly call the meat joint processing factory a 'steel plant'."
    Walking out of the production workshop, we arrived at the pig storage warehouse again. The pig storage warehouse is very large and can accommodate four thousand four hundred pigs. Here we saw another hygiene inspection of the pigs. Pigs that arrive here are first tested for body temperature. Those exceeding forty degrees will be quarantined for inspection; some sick pigs are slaughtered in the emergency slaughterhouse before entering the factory and processed separately. Pigs that have already been tested for body temperature are carefully inspected one by one by veterinarians in the pig warehouse. Pigs with swollen ears, skin diseases, and listlessness are not allowed to enter the slaughterhouse. This further guarantees the freshness and hygiene of the pork.
    After visiting this new type of meat processing factory, we have a greater understanding of the rapid development of the motherland's construction and the country's concern for the people's health.

    在一个猪肉加工厂里
    本报记者　于明　吴荣江
    我们来到新建的安徽省蚌埠肉类联合加工厂，已经是下午四点钟了，厂里的同志还是热情地陪我们下车间参观。
    厂区很大，我们本来准备从原料区，也就是存猪仓库看起。可是在到原料区的路上听到有人说，今天生产很快，屠宰间只剩下几十头活猪了。我们为了能看到怎样宰猪，就先去参观宰猪的地方。果然，候宰栏里的猪只有二十多头了。猪很肥大，一头头拼命挤着朝墙角落里钻。工程师陈学熙对我们说：“宰猪前，猪都洗了澡。”这时，我们仔细一看，才发现头顶上就是许多淋水的喷头，每只猪身上都洗得干干净净的。奇怪的是，在宰猪的地方，我们呆了很久，竟没有听到猪吼叫一声。只看到工人们拿着像理发店吹风机一样的东西，碰一下活猪的头，过了几秒钟，刚才还乱钻的猪就慢慢地倒在地上。猪着了电，提升机很快就把它提走了，大约经过一分钟时间，猪还没有完全苏醒，锋利的尖刀就刺进咽喉。没等到下班，屠宰间工人就完成了一天的任务。在这一天，他们宰了八百头猪。
    这座工厂不但在屠宰以前要把猪洗得很干净，宰猪以后，还要对猪肉进行严格的检查。那些做检验工作的人，动作很熟练，拿到一块猪肉，一眼就能辨别出是好猪还是坏猪。他们有的检验猪的颈项，有的检验食肉，有的检验猪的内脏。猪肉经过他们的手，很快就分成几等。可以出厂的肉，就运入冰冻车间；有的只能化油，就把它们另放。厂办公室主任李好文对我们说：“这些检验的人，大多是刚从初中毕业的，工作时间不长，却学了一套很高的本领。”我们看到一位化验员，在显微镜下发现了旋毛虫。她要我们看，并且说：“有了旋毛虫的猪肉，厂里就要另外加工处理。如果吃了有寄生虫的猪肉，对身体是有害的。”这个工厂从毛猪到做成冻肉，光检验关口要经过八道，检验人员都有高度责任感，真正做到合乎规格才准出厂。这些猪肉，只是看看，也感到它比平常猪肉更加香美。
    这座肉类联合加工厂有冷却和急冻车间，还有冷藏仓库。我们是穿着棉衣和棉大衣进去的。在急冻车间和冷藏库里，气温是摄氏零下十八度。急冻车间里挂的几百条猪肉都是头一天宰的。工程师说：“零下十八度还不是最低温度，再过几小时以后，气温要降到零下二十三到三十度。”我们用手在猪肉上弹了一弹，猪肉已被冻得硬棒棒的了。工程师说：“这种猪肉，放在冷藏室和有冷却设备的地方，存放几年也不会坏，不管运到哪里，拿出来烧吃都和新鲜猪肉味道一样。”走出急冻车间，陪我们参观的同志高兴地说：“从8月底起，我们生产的冻肉已经大量出口。我们的冻肉出国，一吨可以换回四点七吨钢材。所以，我们有的工人同志骄傲地称肉类联合加工厂是‘炼钢厂’”。
    走出生产车间，我们又到了存猪仓库。存猪仓库面积很大，能容四千四百头猪。我们在这里又一次看到了对猪的卫生检查。刚到这里的猪先试体温，超过四十度的，就要隔离检查；有的病猪，不等进厂，就在急宰间宰了，另外处理。已经试过体温的猪，在猪仓库里还要经兽医一个个仔细检查，肿耳、患皮肤病和精神不振的猪，都不能进屠宰间去。这就更保证了猪肉的新鲜和卫生。
    参观完这座新型的肉类加工厂，我们更加体会到祖国建设的飞速发展，更加体会到国家对人民健康的关怀。
