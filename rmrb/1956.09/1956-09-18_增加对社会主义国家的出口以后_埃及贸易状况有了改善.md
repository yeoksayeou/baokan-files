　　Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 17th - A report released by the Egyptian Ministry of Commerce on the 16th stated that increased Egyptian cotton exports to socialist countries helped Egypt reduce its foreign trade deficit in the first half of 1956.

　　The Ministry of Commerce's "Foreign Trade Weekly" published the report, stating that due to the increase in cotton exports to socialist countries, Egypt's export income in the first half of 1956 increased by 35.6% compared to the same period in 1955.

　　At the same time, Egypt "unusually" imported a large amount of machinery and other capital goods, which increased its expenditure on imports by 23.4%. Because the increase in exports was greater than the increase in imports, Egypt's trade deficit decreased by one-fifth.

　　The report pointed out that since 1955, Egypt's cotton exports to the United States have decreased significantly. This resulted in a 43.3% decrease in Egypt's total exports to the United States in the first half of 1956 compared to the same period last year. During the same period, the amount of American goods purchased by Egypt increased by 62.2%.

　　The report said that industrial activity continued to maintain a high rate in the second quarter of this year. Construction continues to expand, and new industrial expansion plans are accelerating.

    增加对社会主义国家的出口以后
    埃及贸易状况有了改善
    新华社17日讯　开罗消息：埃及商业部在16日发表的一份报告中说，埃及对社会主义国家的棉花出口的增加，在1956年上半年帮助埃及减少了它在对外贸易中的逆差。
    商业部的“对外贸易周刊”刊载的这份报告说，由于对社会主义国家的棉花出口增加，埃及1956年上半年的出口收入比1955年同时期增加了35.6％。
    同时，埃及“不平常地”输入了大量机器和其他资本货物，因而使它在进口方面的支出增加了23.4％。由于出口的增加多于进口的增加，埃及的贸易差额减少了五分之一。
    报告指出，从1955年开始，埃及对美国的棉花出口大大减少了。这使得埃及1956年上半年对美国出口的总额比去年同时期下降了43.3％。而在同一个时期，埃及购买美国货物的数量增加了62.2％。
    报告说，今年第二季度工业活动继续保持了很高的速度。建设继续在扩大，新工业扩充计划在加速进行。
