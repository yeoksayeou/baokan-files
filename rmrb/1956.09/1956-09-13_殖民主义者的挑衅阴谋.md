    Colonialists' Provocative Conspiracy
    The United States' professed respect for Egyptian sovereignty and willingness to peacefully resolve the Suez Canal issue has now been proven to be merely a smokescreen to deceive people. After the failure of the "Five-Nation Committee," the United States revealed its ferocious nature and openly participated in the British and French plans to sabotage Suez Canal navigation and carry out armed intervention in Egypt.
    Egyptian President Nasser put forward reasonable proposals for the peaceful resolution of the Suez Canal issue. These proposals were welcomed and valued by all who truly respected Egyptian sovereignty and dignity. However, the United States, Britain, and France were unwilling to consider Egypt's proposal. They opposed holding the international conference suggested by Egypt because they feared that their "international control" plan would be opposed by the majority at such a conference. They preferred to resort to despicable and filthy conspiracies rather than engage in open and honest negotiations.
    In the communique issued by the heads of the British and French governments on the 11th, they declared that Egypt's rejection of the "Dulles Plan" had "created a very serious situation" and threatened that the two countries had reached "complete agreement" on "further measures." They stated that the two countries were "determined" to "resist" together "by all appropriate means" the actions taken by Egypt to safeguard its sovereignty and ensure the navigation of the Suez Canal. United Press International frankly stated in its explanation of the meaning of this communique that it was a "warning" to Egypt: Britain and France would use "open force" against "maltreatment of Britons and Frenchmen in Egypt and any attempt to overturn the status quo of the canal."
    If we connect this with the Suez Canal Company's order, issued on the same day, for non-Egyptian personnel in the Suez Canal to leave their posts starting from the 15th, the provocative conspiracy of Britain and France becomes very clear. Britain and France are clearly trying to create difficulties for canal navigation by forcing non-Egyptian personnel to leave the canal, so that they will have an excuse to carry out armed intervention. If Egypt orders these personnel to remain at their posts in order to ensure canal navigation, they will still use Egypt's "maltreatment" of them as an excuse to carry out arrogant armed intervention.
    Eisenhower revealed further details of the British and French conspiracy to play with fire at a press conference on the 11th. Although, due to considerations for the US election, he declared that the United States "will not participate in the war" "unless Congress declares war," he then said that if traffic was "disrupted," Britain and France would "have reason to take steps" to "discuss" the so-called "free navigation issue" with Egypt, that is, to use the threat of force as a backing to force Egypt to accept the plan of international control. And "if after all peaceful methods have been exhausted," Egypt still has so-called "acts of aggression," the United States will support Britain and France in taking "more forceful actions than simply sailing through the canal" to "continue to use the canal." In other words, if Egypt does not yield again and still resolutely takes a legitimate stand to safeguard national sovereignty, the United States will support Britain and France in armed occupation of the canal.
    It can be seen that the British and French conspiracy has the direct participation of the United States. And the support of the United States is a major reason why British and French warmongers are so arrogant. Therefore, if the situation on the Suez Canal issue is very serious at present, then this situation is created by the United States, Britain, and France. They must bear full responsibility for all the consequences that this situation may produce.
    Now the United States is standing with Britain and France, using war threats to exert crude pressure on Egypt, attempting to force Egypt to abandon its sovereignty. This attitude of the United States, and its reversal of black and white by describing Egypt's actions to safeguard its sovereignty as "acts of aggression," has torn off the mask of hypocrisy with its own hands, exposing the true face of American colonialists.
    However, the United States and its colonialist partners should slow down in preparing their victory celebration feast. On the Suez Canal issue, the attitude of the Egyptian people is firm and clear. The attitude of the people of Asia and Africa is also very clear. If there are still people who do not want to face the changes in the balance of power that have already taken place on the international stage, if there are still people who refuse to remember the painful lessons of Korea, Indochina, and Algeria, and who妄想[wàngxiǎng: to attempt] to gain from war adventures what they cannot get at the negotiating table, then what they will get will be more than just a hot potato.

### 殖民主义者的挑衅阴谋

    殖民主义者的挑衅阴谋
    美国在苏彝士运河问题上所宣传的所谓尊重埃及主权、愿意和平解决的说法，现在已经被证明只是迷惑人们的一阵烟幕。在“五国委员会”失败以后，美国就凶相毕露，公开参与了英、法破坏苏彝士运河航运，对埃及进行武装干涉的计划。
    埃及纳赛尔总统就和平解决苏彝士运河问题提出了合乎情理的建议，这个建议受到一切真正尊重埃及主权和尊严的人的欢迎和重视。但是美、英、法却居然不愿意考虑埃及的这个建议。它们反对举行埃及所建议的国际会议，因为害怕在这样一个会议上它们的“国际管制”计划会遭到大多数人的反对。它们宁愿求助于卑鄙龌龊的阴谋，不肯进行光明磊落的谈判。
    在英、法两国政府首脑11日发表的会谈公报里，他们宣称埃及拒绝“杜勒斯计划”已经“造成了一个非常严重的局势”，并且扬言两国就“进一步措施”取得了“完全一致的意见”。他们表示两国“决心”一起“以一切适当手段来抵抗”埃及为维护主权和保证苏彝士运河航运而采取的行动。合众社在解释这个公报的含意时露骨地说，这是“警告”埃及：英法“将对虐待在埃及的英国人和法国人的事情以及任何推翻运河现状的企图”使用“公开的武力”。
    如果把在同一天前苏彝士运河公司命令在苏彝士运河的非埃及人员从15日起离职这件事联系起来看，英、法的挑衅性阴谋就十分明显。英、法显然企图用迫使非埃及人员离开运河，来给运河通航制造困难，这样它们就有了进行武装干涉的借口。如果埃及为了保证运河通航而命令这些人员留在工作岗位上，它们仍然将以埃及“虐待”他们为借口，狂妄地进行武装干涉。
    艾森豪威尔在11日记者招待会上透露了英、法这个玩火的阴谋的进一步情况。虽然由于美国大选的考虑，他宣称“除非国会宣战”，美国“不会参加战争”，但是他接着又说，如果交通受到了“干扰”，英、法就“有理由采取步骤”，就所谓“自由通航问题”同埃及“进行讨论”，也就是以武力威胁为后盾来迫使埃及接受国际管制的计划。而“如果在一切和平方法都用尽以后”，埃及仍然还有所谓“侵略行动”的话，美国将支持英、法采取“比仅仅驶过运河要更为有力的行动”来“继续使用运河”。换句话说，如果埃及再不屈服，仍坚决采取维护国家主权的正当立场，美国就将支持英、法武装占领运河。
    可见，英、法的阴谋是有美国的直接参与的。而美国的支持，正是英、法好战分子所以如此嚣张的一个主要原因。因此，如果说目前在苏彝士运河问题上局势十分严重的话，那么这个局势是由美、英、法三国一手造成的。它们必须对这种局势可能产生的一切后果负起全部责任。
    现在美国正同英、法站在一起，用战争威胁来对埃及施加粗暴的压力，企图迫使埃及放弃自己的主权。美国的这种态度，以及它把埃及维护主权的行动说成是“侵略行动”这种颠倒黑白的说法，已经用自己的手摘下了伪善者的假面具，一丝不挂地露出了美国殖民主义者的真面目。
    但是，美国和它的殖民主义伙伴们还是慢些给自己准备庆祝胜利的酒宴为好。在苏彝士运河问题上，埃及人民的态度是坚定而明确的。亚非各国人民的态度也是一清二楚的。如果还有人不想正视在国际舞台上已经发生的力量对比的变化，如果还有人不肯记取朝鲜、印度支那、阿尔及利亚的痛苦教训，而妄想从战争冒险中捞取他们在谈判桌上得不到的东西，那么，他们所得到的将不仅仅是一个烫手的山药蛋而已。
