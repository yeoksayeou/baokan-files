Xinhua News Agency, 2nd September. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China issued a statement on September 2, 1956, regarding the intrusion of a US military aircraft into China's airspace on August 23, 1956. The full text is as follows:

     On August 31, 1956, the United States Department of State and the Department of Defense issued a joint statement claiming that the wreckage of a United States Navy aircraft had been discovered in the waters east of the Zhoushan Islands, and that it was believed to be the aircraft that was shot down by our Air Force on August 23. The joint statement by the United States Department of State and the Department of Defense, on the one hand, admitted that the military aircraft may have flown over Chinese islands, but on the other hand, considered our Air Force's attack to be unjustified and demanded that China bear responsibility for the incident. The Chinese government believes that this accusation by the United States is unacceptable, and the United States' demand is without any basis.

    Regarding the fact that after 00:00 on August 23, 1956, our Air Force shot down a Chiang Kai-shek military aircraft that had intruded into the airspace over the Ma'an Islands, Shengsi Islands, and Huangzeshan Island, our news agency has already provided detailed and accurate reports. Whether based on the facts we have or from the joint statement by the United States Department of State and the Department of Defense, the location where our Air Force shot down a military aircraft on August 23 was clearly not in international waters, but in our airspace. In fact, this military aircraft had been active in the airspace over our coastal islands for tens of minutes before being shot down by our Air Force, which shows that the action of this military aircraft intruding into our airspace was by no means accidental. At the same time, everyone knows that this area is a combat area. In this area, the Chiang Kai-shek clique is constantly sending its military aircraft to carry out harassing and destructive war activities. Therefore, the Chinese Air Force must frequently engage them in combat and shoot them down, wound them, or repel them. It goes without saying that these Chiang military aircraft are all American-made aircraft. Under these circumstances, it is entirely justified to consider an American-made military aircraft that intrudes into the airspace of this area for a long time to be a Chiang military aircraft and attack it.

    In fact, the Chinese government pointed out as early as August 27 in its reply to the British government's inquiry on behalf of the United States regarding this incident: If the aircraft that intruded into the airspace over our Ma'an Islands, Shengsi Islands, and Huangzeshan Island was not a Chiang military aircraft but a United States Navy aircraft, we cannot but express our great regret. At the same time, the Chinese government pointed out: If this is the case, this also proves that the activities of the United States Navy's Seventh Fleet in the waters from our Shengsi Islands to Dachen Island on August 23 and 24, and the dispatch of a large number of naval aircraft to intrude into the airspace over our Shengsi Islands for reconnaissance, is a planned provocative action that violates our airspace and territorial waters. Regarding this, the Chinese government cannot but express a serious protest to the United States government.

    Now, the facts prove that the American-made military aircraft that intruded into China's airspace on August 23 was a United States Navy aircraft. However, the United States government has not only not accepted the Chinese government's protest, but has instead made a demand for compensation from the Chinese government. This is completely unreasonable.

    China's territory, airspace, and territorial waters will never allow violation, and the areas and airspace frequently harassed by the Chiang Kai-shek clique's armed forces will even less allow foreign armed forces to infiltrate. United States Navy aircraft violated China's airspace in the August 23 incident, and United States Navy fleets and aircraft have invaded China's territorial waters and airspace on a large scale after the August 23 incident. Regarding this, the Chinese government lodges a serious protest and firmly demands that the United States stop this provocative behavior.

### 我国外交部发表声明  严重抗议美国飞机侵犯我国领空

    我国外交部发表声明
    严重抗议美国飞机侵犯我国领空
    新华社2日讯　中华人民共和国外交部1956年9月2日发表关于1956年8月23日美军飞机侵入我国领空的声明。全文如下：
     1956年8月31日，美国国务院和国防部发表联合声明，声称在我舟山群岛以东的海面发现了一架美国海军飞机的残骸，并且认为这架飞机就是在8月23日被我空军击伤的飞机。美国国务院和国防部的联合声明一方面承认了这架军用飞机可能飞越了中国的岛屿，但是另一方面却认为我空军的攻击是不正当的，要求我国担负这次事件的责任。中国政府认为，美国的这种指摘是不能接受的，美国的要求是没有任何根据的。
    关于1956年8月23日零时以后，我空军击伤窜入我马鞍列岛、嵊泗列岛和黄泽山岛上空的蒋军飞机一架的事实，我国通讯社早已有了详尽和准确的报导。不论根据我国所掌握的事实或者是从美国国务院和国防部的联合声明来看，8月23日我空军击伤一架军事飞机的地点显然不是在公海的上空，而是在我国的领空。事实上，这架军用飞机在被我空军击伤以前，已在我国沿海岛屿上空活动达数十分钟之久，这就说明，这架军用飞机侵入我领空的行动决不是偶然的。同时，大家知道，这个地区是一个作战地区，在这个地区，蒋介石集团不断地派遣它的军用飞机进行骚扰性和破坏性的战争活动，因而中国空军必须与他们经常进行战斗，并且将他们击落、击伤或者击退。不言而喻，这些蒋军飞机都是美式飞机。在这种情况下，认为侵入这一地区的上空进行长时间活动的美式军用飞机是蒋军飞机而予以攻击是完全正当的。
    事实上，中国政府早在8月27日答复英国政府代表美国所提出的有关这次事件的询问中已经指出：如果侵入我马鞍列岛、嵊泗列岛和黄泽山岛上空的这架飞机，竟然不是蒋军飞机而是美国海军飞机的话，我们不能不表示极大的遗憾。同时，中国政府指出：如果是这样，这也就证明8月23日和24日美国海军第七舰队在我国嵊泗列岛到大陈岛一带海面活动，并且派遣大批海军飞机侵入我嵊泗列岛的上空进行侦察一事，是一种有计划地侵犯我国领空和领海的挑衅行动。对此，中国政府不能不向美国政府表示严重的抗议。
    现在，事实证明8月23日侵入中国领空的美式军用飞机就是美国的海军飞机，但是，美国政府不仅没有接受中国政府的抗议，反而向中国政府提出赔偿要求，这是完全没有道理的。
    中国的领土、领空和领海决不容许侵犯，而蒋介石集团武装力量经常窜扰的地区和上空，更不容许外国武装力量混入。美国海军飞机在8月23日的事件中侵犯了中国的领空，美国海军舰队和飞机在8月23日的事件以后更大批地侵犯中国的领海和领空。对此，中国政府提出严重的抗议，并且坚决地要求美国停止这次挑衅行为。
