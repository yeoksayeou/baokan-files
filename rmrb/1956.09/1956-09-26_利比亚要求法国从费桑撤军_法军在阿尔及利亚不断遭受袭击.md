    Xinhua News Agency, September 25th dispatch from Tripoli (TASS): According to the "Gibbli Weekly," Libyan Ambassador to Egypt, Sadiq Muntasser, recently stated that if France does not withdraw its troops from Fezzan by November according to the provisions of the French-Libyan agreement, Libya will submit the issue to the United Nations and the Arab League.
    The newspaper pointed out that the Libyan ambassador made this statement because of reports that France does not intend to ratify the French-Libyan agreement on the withdrawal of French troops from Fezzan. Libya has already ratified the agreement.
    Xinhua News Agency, September 25th dispatch from Paris (TASS): According to Paris newspapers, the situation in Algeria has recently become tense again. In the battle of Palestro a few days ago, sixteen French soldiers and one officer were killed. The French General Headquarters has dispatched 5,000 reinforcements, aircraft, and helicopters to the area.
    Reports on the 24th stated that four French vehicles carrying French soldiers were shot at on the Ain-Sefra to Beni-Ounif road; six people were killed and thirteen were injured.
    The French Former Prisoners of War Organization (with 800,000 members), which originally supported the government's policies, now begins to support the movement to strive for a peaceful solution to the Algerian problem. The organization passed a resolution at a conference held in Nice, expressing the hope that the necessary measures will be taken "to restore peace in Algeria."

    利比亚要求法国从费桑撤军
    法军在阿尔及利亚不断遭受袭击
    新华社25日讯　塔斯社的黎波里25日讯：据“吉布利周报”报道，利比亚驻埃及大使萨迪克·蒙塔塞尔最近发表声明说，如果法国不按照法国—利比亚协定的规定在11月以前把它的军队从费桑撤走，利比亚将把这个问题提交联合国和阿拉伯联盟。
    这家报纸指出，利比亚大使所以发表这项声明，是因为有消息说法国不打算批准法国—利比亚关于由费桑撤出法国军队的协定。利比亚已经批准了这一协定。
    新华社25日讯　据塔斯社巴黎24日讯：据巴黎报纸报道，最近阿尔及利亚的情势又趋紧张。前几天在帕勒斯特罗的战斗中有十六名法国士兵和一名军官死亡。法国总司令部已经向这个地区调去五千名增援部队、飞机和直升飞机。
    24日各报报道，载运法国士兵的四辆法国汽车在恩—塞弗尔至贝尼—乌尼弗公路上遭到射击；六人被击毙、十三人受伤。
    原来支持政府政策的法国前战俘组织（拥有会员八十万人）现在开始支持争取和平解决阿尔及利亚问题的运动。这个组织在尼萨举行的大会通过一项决议，表示希望将能采取必要的措施，“以恢复阿尔及利亚的和平”。
