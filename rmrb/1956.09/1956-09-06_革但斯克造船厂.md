    Gdańsk Shipyard
    By Polish reporter, Władysław Brzeżel
    July 31st this year was an unusual day at the Gdańsk Shipyard in Poland. All the factory's employees gathered around the dock, cheering as the third 10,000-ton vessel made in Poland was launched. Only three months before, they had added the second 10,000-ton large ship, the "Beirut," to Poland's merchant fleet.

    The construction of 10,000-ton ships is a major event in Poland's shipbuilding industry, marking the rapid development of our shipbuilding industry. Before building such large tonnage vessels, we first had to learn to build smaller ships; starting with ships of a few hundred tons, then thousands of tons, and then "ten thousand" tons. Building 10,000-ton ships can be said to be another beginning. Now our shipyards are planning to build 15,000-ton and 20,000-ton ships. This is also a prospect that will be realized in the near future, within a few years.

    In shipbuilding, we had no foundation in the past. Before the war, the few merchant ships flying the Polish flag were all made abroad. They were made in Belgian, French, or Italian shipyards, or in Danish, German, or Dutch shipyards. The bourgeois government never thought of establishing a shipbuilding industry. Some even cited a lot of reasons to illustrate the incompetence of Polish engineers, technicians, and workers, saying that they could not master this technologically complex industry.

    But the achievements Poland has made in the post-war period completely refute the shameless arguments of the old rulers. In the twelve years of People's Poland, the total tonnage of ships built by the Gdańsk Shipyard has exceeded two and a half times the total tonnage of our country's pre-war merchant fleet. And this is only in terms of the Gdańsk Shipyard; the shipyards in Gdynia and Szczecin are not included.

    The ships built by Polish shipyards sail on oceans all over the world, and they are all designed and built by Polish engineers and technicians. The pre-war rulers obliterated their talents and abilities, causing them to feel the pain of having no place to use their skills, and living in extreme poverty due to years of unemployment. Today, these Polish engineers, technicians, and workers are showing their skilled techniques and abilities every moment. And they themselves are also growing with the development of the shipbuilding industry. For example, when the first Polish ship was launched, Comrade Szarlejko was still a tractor driver, and today he is an engineer. Znojewski was a fitter when he started working at the shipyard, and now he is the director of the factory. Władysław Donsznyff was originally an ordinary worker and is now a workshop director. Tomasz Malik is now a workshop director, but was previously a blacksmith. Comrade Guzarek, who used to be a welder, has also been promoted to workshop director, and he has obtained an engineering degree while working and studying.

    Poland's first ocean-going merchant ship was launched in 1948, with a tonnage of 2,620 tons. Eight years later, in 1956, the one hundred and forty-eighth ship slid off the dock, with a tonnage of 10,800 tons. The length of the hull is 153 meters, the height of the ship is equal to six floors, and the range is 20,000 nautical miles (equal to one week around the Earth's equator). The ship's equipment is modern, the navigation instruments are electrically operated, and it has radar equipment. The cargo holds and deck machinery are also electrified.

    Our shipbuilding industry today has a large number of shipbuilding workers, and many workers work in the smaller shipyards along our coast. Their work is very valuable to our country.

    Shipbuilding is a difficult and dangerous job, so shipbuilding workers are treated relatively well. The "Regulations for Shipbuilding Industry Workers" promulgated by the state in 1952 provide shipbuilding workers with various special considerations. In addition to the above-mentioned special treatment and care, shipbuilding workers also enjoy many preferential treatments in terms of labor insurance, medical care, and cultural welfare. The living and rest conditions of shipbuilding employees are constantly improving. More than two thousand workers and their families live in the new residential area of Gdańsk, and single workers have seven comfortable dormitories. There is also a clinic with sixteen doctors and modern equipment to take care of their health and the health of their families. The shipyard itself also has a hospital with sixty beds. The shipyard has a sanatorium in Kościerzyna, a scenic spot near Gdańsk. During holidays, buses are full of workers coming here for recuperation. Some workers also spend their two-week vacation here.

    Workers' children can participate in summer camps. This year, a new idea was also created. The shipyard reached an agreement with the trade unions of coal mines and metallurgical factories in Upper Silesia to exchange children for summer vacation. This allows the children of miners and metallurgical workers in Silesia to have the opportunity to play by the sea, and the children of shipbuilding workers can also appreciate the beauty of "Green Silesia."

    In order to reduce the burden on female workers in the factory, the shipyard has opened three modern nurseries and kindergartens that can accommodate hundreds of children to take care of the young children of the workers.

    Great importance is also attached to sports here. The shipyard has a stadium and a gymnasium with 5,000 seats. Currently, the shipyard is building a second stadium.

    Our shipbuilding workers create wealth for the country with their labor, and their work achievements can make them proud. They prove to the world that they have the ability to build beautiful ships. These ships make the name of Poland known in ports all over the world, and these ships are a sign of the progress of our peaceful construction cause. Relying on the hard work of our shipyard workers, our white and red national flag flutters in the ports of dozens of countries around the world.

    革但斯克造船厂
    波兰记者　乌瓦笛斯瓦夫·布鲁泽尔
    今年7月31日，在波兰革但斯克造船厂里是一个不寻常的日子。厂里的全体职工聚集在船坞的周围，欢呼着波兰自制的第三艘万吨轮船下水。而只不过在三个月以前，他们刚把第二艘万吨的大轮船——“贝鲁特号”加入了波兰的商船队。
    上万吨的轮船的建设是波兰造船工业中的重大事件，它标志着我国造船工业的迅速发展。在建造这样大吨位的船只以前，我们首先要学会造小船；开头造几百吨的船，然后是几千吨的，再以后是“万吨”的。而建造万吨的船可以说又是另一个开端。现在我们的船厂更在计划要造一万五千吨和两万吨的船了。这也是不久将来的事，是几年内就会实现的前景。
    在造船业方面，我们过去毫无基础，战前，挂着波兰旗的几艘商船统统是外国造的。不是比利时、法国、意大利造船厂就是丹麦、德国、荷兰造船厂造的。资产阶级政府从来没有想到建立起造船工业来。有些还举出一大堆理由来说明波兰的工程师、技术人员和工人的低能，说他们不可能掌握这门技术复杂的工业。
    但波兰在战后时期所取得的成就完全反驳了旧日统治者的无耻的论调。在人民波兰的十二年中，革但斯克造船厂造出的船只总吨位已超出了我国战前的商船总吨位的两倍半。这还只是以革但斯克船厂而言，琴尼亚和斯才新这另外两个地方的造船厂还不算在内。
    波兰各船厂所造的船只航行在世界各个海洋上，它们都是波兰本国的工程师和技术人员所设计和建造的。战前的统治者曾抹煞掉他们的才干和能力，使他们深感英雄无用武之地的痛苦，并因为常年的失业而生活在极端的贫穷之中。今天，这些波兰的工程师、技术人员和工人们正在每时每刻地显示出他们熟练的技巧和本领。而且他们自己也随着造船工业的发展而成长起来了。例如，当波兰第一艘轮船下水时，沙尔台克同志还是一个拖拉机手，今天他已经是一个工程师了。兹诺郁夫斯基在造船厂开始工作时，是个装配工，现在他是厂长了。弗拉底斯洛·顿斯尼夫斯基原是一名普通工人，现在是车间主任。托马斯·马立克现在是一个车间主任，而以前是个铁匠。原来当焊工的古沙尔克同志现在也升为车间主任了，他一面工作一面上学，已经得到了工程师学位。
    波兰自造的第一艘远洋商船是在1948年下水的，吨位为二千六百二十吨。八年以后的1956年，由船坞上滑下去了第一百四十八艘轮船，吨位是一万另八百吨。船身长度为一百五十三公尺，船高等于六层楼，航程为两万海哩（即等于地球赤道的一周）。船上设备都是现代化的，航行仪器由电气操纵，并拥有雷达设备。货舱和甲板上的机器也是电气化的。
    我国的造船工业今天已拥有一大批造船工人，有许多工人在我们沿海比较小的造船厂里工作，他们的工作对我国是十分珍贵的。
    造船是一种困难而危险的工作，因此造船工人的待遇比较优厚。1952年国家颁布的“造船业工人规章”，给造船厂工人以各种特殊照顾。除了上述特殊待遇和照顾外，造船工人还在劳保、医药、文化福利方面享有不少优待。造船职工的生活和休息条件在不断地改善。有两千多工人同他们的家属住在革但斯克新住宅区内，单身的工人有七座舒适的宿舍，还有一所有十六位医生和现代化设备的诊疗所照顾着他们和他们家属的健康。造船厂自己也有一所医院有六十张病床。造船厂在革但斯克城附近的风景优美的科斯齐诺设有一个休养所。每逢假日，公共汽车满载着工人来这里休养。有的工人还在这里欢度他们为时两星期的休假期。
    工人的孩子们可以参加夏令营。今年还创办了一项新花样，造船厂同上西里西亚煤矿和冶金工厂工会取得协议，彼此交换儿童过暑假。这就使得西里西亚的矿工和冶金工人的子女有机会到海边玩耍，而造船工人的子女们也能够欣赏“绿色西里西亚”的美景。
    造船厂为了减轻厂内女工的负担，开办了三个设备现代化的托儿所和可容纳数百名儿童的幼儿园来收托工人们的幼小儿女。
    这里对体育运动也是很重视的。造船厂有一个运动场和一个有五千个座位的体育馆。目前造船厂又在建造第二个运动场。
    我国的造船工人以他们的劳动为国家创造财富，他们的劳动成绩是可以使他们骄傲的。他们向全世界证明他们有能力造出漂亮的船来。这些船在全世界的各港口使人们知道波兰这个名字，这些船是我国和平建设事业进步的标志。依靠我国造船厂工人辛勤的劳动，我国白红色的国旗招展在全世界数十个国家的港口。　（本报特约稿）（附图片）
