    Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, September 3rd: Egyptian Government Intelligence Director Hatem announced on September 1st that two British men have signed confessions identifying four secretaries at the British Embassy in Egypt as contacts in an espionage conspiracy.
    Hatem showed photographic copies of these confessions to reporters at a press conference.
    Hatem said that James Swinburne, business manager of the British-run Arab News Agency, and Charles Pittack, acting manager of Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company, first pointed out Gough and Flax, the British Embassy secretaries who were recently expelled, as contacts. They received instructions from these two individuals and passed on military secrets to them.
    Swinburne also confessed that before Gough came to Cairo in 1954, the contacts were Tawney Crokes and St. John, British Embassy secretaries who have now left Egypt.
    Prior to this, on August 31, the Egyptian Intelligence Service also published a document from a British spy ring seized by Egyptian police authorities. This was an unsigned letter to an unidentified person, with words intended to instruct members of this spy network on how to contact each other. The letter also mentioned how members of a spy organization could contact Swinburne.
    According to Cairo newspapers, new facts discovered by Egypt in investigating the British espionage case prove that the British spy network in Egypt is widely distributed. The Egyptian Prosecutor General has ordered the investigation to continue, even though it was originally scheduled to end on September 1st.
    According to "Al-Akhbar," in addition to the twelve people initially arrested (including three British citizens), a new group of people engaged in espionage activities for Britain has recently been arrested. Newspapers report that the investigation has determined that the British Embassy in Cairo has funded personnel in the now-defunct spy organization with a large amount of money.

    被埃及捕获的两名英国间谍供认
    英国外交人员在埃及进行间谍活动
    新华社3日讯　开罗消息：埃及政府情报司司长哈特姆9月1日宣布，有两名英国人已经签署供词，指明英国驻埃及大使馆的四个秘书是间谍阴谋中的联络人。
    哈特姆在记者招待会上给大家看了这些供词的摄影副本。
    哈特姆说，英国人办的阿拉伯通讯社业务经理詹姆斯·斯温伯恩和马可尼无线电报公司的代理经理查尔斯·皮塔克首先指出最近被驱逐的英国大使馆秘书果夫和弗拉克斯是联络人，他们从这两个人那里得到指示，同时他们把军事秘密交给这两个人。
    斯温伯恩又供认，在果夫在1954年来开罗以前，联络人是现在已经离开埃及的英国大使馆秘书陶纳·柯克斯和圣约翰。
    在这以前，埃及情报司还在8月31日发表了埃及警察当局缴获的英国间谍组织的一个文件。这是一封给一个来路不明的人的未署名的信件，信内有些话意在指示这个间谍网成员之间如何联系。信中也提到了一个间谍组织的成员如何同斯温伯恩联系。
    据开罗报纸报道，埃及在侦查英国间谍案中发现的一些新的事实证明，英国间谍网在埃及分布很广。埃及检察长已经下令继续侦查，虽然原来规定侦查要在9月1日结束。
    据“消息报”说，除最初逮捕的十二个人（其中有三个英国人）之外，最近又逮捕了一批为英国从事间谍活动的人。据报纸说，侦查结果断定，英国驻开罗大使馆曾经以大量金钱资助现已经破获的间谍组织的人员。
