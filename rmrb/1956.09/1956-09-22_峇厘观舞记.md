    A Record of Watching Dances in Bali
    Zheng Zhenduo
    On July 23, 1955, I arrived at Bali, the "Island of Poetry" in Indonesia, and stayed there for eight days. I appreciated a lot of Balinese art, from painting and wood carving to dance. I saw especially a lot of dances, including the Southern School, the Northern School, the court dances, the folk dances, the classical dances, and the modern dances. Having seen them, it is not easy to forget them. Now, the Indonesian Balinese Art Friendship Delegation has come to China. I have extracted a few paragraphs from my diary about Balinese dance and written this article as an introduction and as a welcome.
    Also, when the Indonesian Art Delegation came to China last time, it included representatives of dances from various places and schools in Indonesia, but it did not include Balinese dance. This is because Balinese dance has its own unique style, and the number of musicians required by the orchestra is particularly large, so it is necessary to conduct a separate visit. When visiting Czechoslovakia, the Balinese Art Troupe also went alone.
    Bali is located to the east of Java, separated by water. However, the customs and culture are quite different. Bali has its own distinct religion (Hinduism), and every household enshrines several shrines and makes offerings every day. The weather seems very humid. Deep, lush greenery is everywhere. The trees are dense and shady. Stone walls and bricks are covered with moss, showing an ancient and weathered air. Every household has walls and gates, which is somewhat similar to Chinese residences. Speaking of which, there are quite a few Chinese influences in Bali. In some temples, there are Chinese-style Buddha statues, and Chinese copper coins are still popular (mostly from the Wanli to Tongzhi periods of the Ming and Qing Dynasties). They use these copper coins to create statues of gods and donate them to temples. Therefore, we felt very close to Bali when we visited.
    On the evening of July 23, in Denpasar, the largest city in southern Bali, I saw the world-famous Balinese dance for the first time. A large group of musical instruments were arranged on both sides. More than thirty musicians took the stage one after another and sat down. (A band can have as many as sixty or as few as twenty-four musicians.) The instruments are mainly large gongs, ball gongs, and bronze sarons, with "gambang" (drums) providing the rhythm. Stringed harps (very similar to the erhu) and wind instruments such as flutes and pipes are also used, but they are not the main instruments. At nine o'clock, a sea breeze came slowly, and the night was as cool as water. Suddenly, there was a thunderous sound like a bolt from the blue, and the gongs and drums rang out in unison, as rapid as a downpour, directly shaking the hearts and lungs of the listeners. The "prelude" began. Heroic and vigorous, like hundreds of lions roaring in unison, like the flashing of lightning and the rumbling of thunder before a storm, splitting the sky. But gradually, it changed from fast to slow, and the sounds of the flute and sarons were like whispers, like a cool breeze blowing over the peaks of ten thousand pines, like a clear stream flowing over a pile of chaotic rocks, delicate to the point of stirring the soul, with lingering sounds that were endless. Then, there was another burst of wild sound, and all the instruments blared. The melody did not seem unfamiliar, and several sections were almost like Chinese wind and percussion music. Rising and falling, uplifting and suppressing in this way, it lasted for more than ten minutes before stopping. We were so captivated that we could not hear or see anything else. Such a performance of percussion instruments is the highest level of technical display. A clever critic said that it was a large-scale, disassembled "piano" concert. This "exquisite" description is indeed worthy of the Indonesian "Gamelan" (orchestra). After a short rest, the dancers took the stage. With the music of the "Gamelan," whether performing heroic struggles or depicting lyrical paces, they were all intoxicating. The "Beetle Dance" performed by two young girls delicately expressed the love and interdependence of a pair of beetles. The mask dance was tense, tortuous, and full of changes. The solo dance by Mrs. Cha Wanfu was particularly bright and lively, fully demonstrating the profound cultivation and delicate and exquisite skills of Balinese dance. Every gesture and step has a charming, touching, and moving power. The fan in her hand was wielded so flexibly; those eyes, that head, those slender hands, moved so beautifully with the music, especially the hands, the movements were endlessly complex, and every extension and contraction of each fingertip had its own special meaning. She moved forward, backward, advanced, retreated, swirled to the left to dance lightly, or turned sharply to the right, truly giving a sense of being like a swimming dragon and a startled swan. This requires careful deliberation and focused appreciation; a careless person will not appreciate its most subtle beauty. Some people say that Balinese dance has no facial expressions, but after seeing Mrs. Cha Wanfu's rich and flexible expressions, we know that that statement is inaccurate.
    On the 24th, we arrived at "Ditagangga." Along the way, the sea water was emerald green, and there were salt fields everywhere. Coconut groves stood tall, like giants bowing to each other. "Ditagangga" is the villa of a deposed king. There are several fountains in the villa, gurgling and splashing cool water droplets. Red fish are kept in the spring, swimming freely. We sat by the fountain and watched the Balinese court dance. This kind of dance is rarely seen outside. The dancers are all young boys and girls, who still need to be carried and supported to enter. The orchestra also uses "Gamelan." The deposed king personally accompanied us. One of the dancers was the deposed king's seven-year-old granddaughter. Her dancing skills were very skillful, with quick and slow advances and retreats, all in accordance with the rhythm.
    In the afternoon of the same day, we arrived at "Klungkung" and watched a mask dance drama in a former palace. The masks on Bali are diverse. Some wear the entire mask and cannot speak (mainly those playing the role of princes); some wear masks but have their eyes and mouths exposed (like clowns); some have masks with the lower part, where the mouth is, being movable and able to speak, but somewhat unclearly; some have the upper part of the face exposed, with only the nose and mouth having half a mask; and some are like the masks used in the "Monk and Woman" dance during Chinese New Year, which are worn completely over the head. The stories performed are taken from the two major Indian epics, "Mahabharata" and "Ramayana," and some are performances of Indonesian historical stories.
    In the evening, in Denpasar, we watched the Eastern Balinese dance, which is relatively modern. There were dance dramas without masks, group dances, and solo dances. In addition to performing stories from Indian epics and historical stories, most of the dance dramas perform the struggle between good and evil. Although the evil gods are rampant for a while, the good gods eventually prevail. When dancing, the martial arts skills are very deep. Wrestling and standing up, a person without proper training would surely be injured. Among them, the group dance "Butterfly Dance" was the most praised.
    On the 27th, we departed from Denpasar to Singaraja (the Lion King City). Coffee trees and lychee trees were mixed in the banana groves, the greenery was extremely dense. We had to pass through several high ridges. The scenery along the way was extremely beautiful. From afar, we saw a lake of water on the ground, and we also passed a scorched volcano with no grass growing. The highest place is called "Kintamani," meaning the world of ultimate bliss. Beyond this is northern Bali. The Governor's Office is located in Singaraja City.
    At about six o'clock on the evening of the 29th, we watched a performance of northern Balinese dance on the stone corridor in front of the Governor's Office. The classical dance had profound expressions and high skills. There was a performance of the story of "Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai." Although we did not understand the lyrics, it aroused a strong sense of homesickness. There were also eight female dancers and nine male dancers, sitting or standing, singing and dancing with each other in a "mountain song duet," the rhythm was very beautiful. It is said that the lyrics of the questions and answers contained many humorous and satirical beautiful words, but we could not understand them, and could only comprehend the general meaning of their dancing and singing. There were also songs and dances from Timor Island in the Southeast Province, the local color was very strong, and it could also be appreciated and savored.
    After watching several Balinese dances, I cannot say that I understood the essence of them, but their goodness will not be forgotten. Although it has been more than a year since we parted, the sound of the "Gamelan" in Denpasar is still like in my ears, and the wonderful dances and clear songs of Mrs. Cha Wanfu and the other dancers are still before my eyes. It should be especially mentioned that the artists on Bali are not professional at all. They are experts, but they do not make a living from it. For example, if the "Gamelan" orchestra wants to perform, it must gather that group of musicians together in advance. It is impossible to gather them together on a temporary basis. And Mrs. Cha Wanfu, such a superb dancer, is also not a professional. She and her husband both have to work every day. The drummer of that "Gamelan" (the leader) sells coffee on the street. Not only dancers and musicians are like this, but also most of the painters and woodcarvers on Bali are amateurs. This "Island of Poetry" is so full of poetic meaning. It can be said that the entire island is a breeding ground and nurturing ground for art.

    峇厘观舞记
    郑振铎
    我在1955年7月23日到了印度尼西亚的“诗之岛”峇厘，在那里住了八天，欣赏了不少峇厘岛上的艺术，从绘画、木雕刻到舞蹈，尤其以舞蹈看得比较多，南派的、北派的、宫庭的、民间的、古典的、现代的，差不多全都看到过。看到，便不容易忘记。现在，印度尼西亚的峇厘艺术友好访问团到中国来了，特从日记里摘出有关峇厘舞的几段，写成本文，作为介绍也作为欢迎。
    又，上次印度尼西亚艺术代表团到中国来访问时，包括了印度尼西亚的各个地方、各个派别的舞蹈的代表，但独独没有包括峇厘岛的舞蹈在内。这是因为峇厘舞有其特殊的风格，且需要的乐队人数特别多，故有单独进行访问的必要。到捷克斯洛伐克去访问时，也是峇厘艺术团单独去的。
    峇厘岛在爪哇岛的东边，隔水可以相望。但风俗人情却相差颇远。峇厘岛自有其不同的宗教（印度教），家家户户都供奉着好几座神龛，每天都要上供。天气仿佛很润湿。到处都是深浓的绿色。大树蔽天，茂密郁润。石墙和砖块上，全长满了青苔，显出苍老的古气。家家户户都有墙，有大门，这就和中国的住宅有些相似了。说起来，在峇厘，中国的风趣还有不少。在一些庙宇里有中国式的佛像，还流行着中国的铜钱（明万历到同治的最多）。他们用这些铜钱编成神像，还布施到神庙去。所以，我们到峇厘岛去，觉得十分地亲切。
    7月23日的晚上，在峇厘岛上的南部大城邓巴刹，第一次看到世界著名的峇厘舞蹈。一大群的乐器，分列两厢。乐师们三十多人陆续登场坐下。（一个乐队的乐师们，多者达六十多人，少者也有二十四人。）乐器以大铜锣、球锣和铜的刹龙（Sarun）为主，而以“甘梆”（鼓）为之节，也用上了弦乐的竖琴（很像胡琴）和管乐的箫、笛，不过不是主要的乐器。到了九点钟，海风徐来，夜凉如水，忽听得晴天霹雳似的一声响，金鼓齐鸣，急如骤雨，直震撼得听者们心肺俱为之荡动。“前奏曲”开始了。豪雄刚健，像千百只狮子在同声怒吼，像暴风雨之前，雷电交闪，殷殷轰轰，天空为裂。但渐渐地由急而缓，箫声和刹龙声像在微语，像凉风吹过万松之巅，像清溪流过乱石堆头，细腻到荡人魂魄的地步，余音袅袅，不绝如缕。然后，又一声狂响，百乐大鸣。那乐调似乎并不陌生，有好几节简直像中国的吹打细乐。如此地忽高忽低，忽扬忽抑，足足有十多分钟才停止。我们被镇摄得耳无旁听，目不旁视。像这样的打击乐器的演奏，乃是最高级的技术的挥施。有一个聪明的批评家说，这乃是大规模的拆散了的“钢琴”的大合奏。这句“绝妙好辞”的形容的话对于印度尼西亚的“嘎木兰”（乐队）说来，的确是当之无愧的。歇息了一会，舞者们登场了。随着“嘎木兰”的乐声，或表演雄武的斗争，或描写抒情的步调，都足令人心醉。二少女演的“甲虫舞”，细致地表现出一对甲虫的恋爱和相依为命的感情。面具舞则紧张曲折，变化多端。查宛夫人的独舞，尤为光朗明快，充分地显示出峇厘舞的修养深厚而细腻精巧的技术来。一举手，一投足，都具有迷人、动人、感人的力量。那把扇子在她手里是那么灵活地挥动着；那双眼，那头部，那纤纤的双手，是那么美妙地随着乐声而转动着，特别是手部，那动作是无穷尽的繁细，每一指尖的伸屈，都具有其特殊的意义。她或前、或后、或进、或退，或左旋以翩翔，或右转而急却，诚有宛若游龙，翩若惊鸿之感。这是需要精致的推敲与专心的欣赏的，粗心人不会体会其最细微的美妙处。有人说，峇厘舞脸部没有表情，我们看了查宛夫人那么丰富灵活的表情，便知道那句话是不确的。
    24日到达“狄打岗加”。沿途海水碧绿，到处是盐场。椰林矗立，若巨人相向而揖。“狄打岗加”是一位逊王的别墅。别墅里有几道喷泉，淙淙地在飞溅着清凉的水珠。泉中蓄有红色鱼，游泳自如，我们就在喷泉旁，坐着看峇厘岛的宫庭舞。这种舞在外间已不多见。舞者都为幼童及幼女，尚需人抱、掖以进。乐队亦是用“嘎木兰”。那位逊王亲自陪着我们。舞者之一，即逊王的七岁孙女。舞技是很工的，疾徐进退，莫不应节。
    同日下午，到了“革隆公”，在一个故宫里，看面具舞剧。峇厘岛上的面具，是多种多样的。有戴上了整个面具，不能出声的（以扮王公者为主）；有虽戴了面具，而露出双眼与嘴部来的（像丑角）；有面具的下部，当嘴部的地方，是活动的，能够发言，但有些模糊不清的；有脸的上部露出，仅鼻部和嘴部有半个面具的；也有像中国新年时跳“月明和尚度柳翠”舞里所用的和尚、妇人的面具，整个地套在头上的。所演的故事，有取之于印度两大史诗“摩诃菩拉他”和“拉马耶那”的，也有是演出印度尼西亚的历史故事的。
    晚上，在邓巴刹又看了东峇厘舞，比较地现代化，有不戴面具的舞剧，有群舞，有独舞。舞剧除了表演印度史诗的故事和历史故事之外，大都是表演善与恶的斗争的。恶神虽猖獗一时，但善神终于得胜。舞的时候，武功很深，摔交立起，非训练有素的人，必会受伤。其中，以群舞的“蝴蝶舞”最得人赞扬。
    27日，从邓巴刹动身到新加拉夜（即狮王城）。咖啡树和荔枝树，杂在芭蕉林里，绿意至浓。要经过几座高岭。一路上，风光极为秀丽。远远地见地下有一泓湖水，又经过一座焦黑的寸草不生的火山。最高之地，称为“金打曼尼”，意即极乐世界。过此，即北部峇厘了。省长公署，即设在新加拉夜城。
    29日晚六时许，在省长公署的前面石廊上，看北峇厘舞蹈的演出。古典舞表情深刻，技术甚高。有演唱“梁山伯，祝英台”故事的，虽不懂其歌辞，而甚惹乡情。又有八个女舞蹈者和九个男舞蹈者，或坐或立，彼此歌唱着，舞蹈着，“山歌互答”，音节甚为优美。据说，那彼此问答的歌辞里，含有很多幽默和讽刺的漂亮话，但我们是不能了解的了，只能意会其且舞且歌的大意耳。又有东南省蒂汶岛的歌舞，地方的色调很浓厚，也可欣赏吟味。
    看了几场的峇厘舞，说不上就懂得其精华所在，但其好处是不会忘记的。虽然相别已经一年多了，但邓巴刹的“嘎木兰”的响声还如在耳边，查宛夫人和其余的舞蹈家们的妙舞清歌，还如在目前。应该特别提起的是，峇厘岛上的艺人们，全不是职业的。他们是专家，但并不以此为业。像“嘎木兰”的乐队，如要演出，就须事前召集那一批音乐家们凑在一起。临时召集，是办不到的。又像查宛夫人那样的高超的舞蹈家，也还不是职业的，她和她丈夫都是每天要劳动的职工。那一位“嘎木兰”的击鼓者（即领导人），乃是在街头卖咖啡的。不仅舞蹈家、音乐家们如此，就是峇厘岛上的画家们和木雕家们也都是业余的为多。这个“诗之岛”是那样地富于诗意。可以说整个岛乃是一个艺术的涵养地，孕育地。
