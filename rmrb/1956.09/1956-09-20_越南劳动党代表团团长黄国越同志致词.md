Comrade Representatives,

We are honored to be sent by the Central Executive Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party to attend the great Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China.

We warmly congratulate the Congress and wish our dear Chairman Mao, the comrades of the Party Central Committee, and all representative comrades good health.

Here, I would like to read the congratulatory letter from our Party Central Executive Committee to the Congress as follows:

To the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China,

Dear Comrades,

On behalf of the Vietnam Workers' Party and the Vietnamese people, we extend our warm, fraternal greetings to the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China.

After thirty-five years of arduous and heroic struggle, the Communist Party of China has led the six hundred million Chinese people to achieve a historic victory with profound and far-reaching impact on the world. The glorious achievements of the Chinese revolution have given the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union a position of superiority. The powerful People's Republic of China is now steadily advancing on the road of building socialism and actively defending peace in Asia and the world. This is a brilliant example for the national and democratic movements of all countries and a powerful encouragement for all oppressed nations in the world.

The destinies of our two countries are closely linked. The generous and selfless assistance that China has given to Vietnam in all circumstances is the noblest expression of the deep friendship between our two peoples and the close international solidarity between our two parties. This ever-growing friendship and solidarity is one of the reliable guarantees for the development and prosperity of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and for the bright future of the struggle to consolidate peace and achieve Vietnamese unification on the basis of the Geneva Accords.

Here, we once again express the deep gratitude of our entire people and the entire Party to the Chinese people and the Communist Party of China, headed by the beloved Chairman Mao Zedong.

Chinese practice has proved that the masses of the people led by a party armed with Marxism-Leninism have extraordinary strength and enormous creativity. The rich experience of the Chinese revolution, which ingeniously applied Marxism-Leninism to the Chinese context, has further illuminated the path of the Vietnamese revolution and has made a significant contribution to the victories achieved by the Vietnamese people in the cause of national liberation and the construction of the Vietnamese people's democratic system. The thriving socialist revolutionary upsurge in China is inspiring all the Vietnamese people, clearly seeing that China's today is Vietnam's tomorrow, and fighting with even greater confidence to building a peaceful, unified, independent, democratic, and prosperous Vietnam.

Dear Comrades, the Central Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party respectfully wishes the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China brilliant achievements.

The entire Vietnam Workers' Party and the entire Vietnamese people are deeply convinced that, following the correct guidelines and instructions of the Congress, the Chinese people will victoriously complete the Five-Year Economic Plan and achieve great achievements in the cause of socialist construction in China, making China – the fortress of peace in Asia – increasingly consolidated.

Long live invincible Marxism-Leninism!

Long live the glorious Communist Party of China!

Long live the unbreakable friendship between the Vietnamese and Chinese peoples!

    越南劳动党代表团团长黄国越同志致词各位代表同志们：
    我们荣幸地得到越南劳动党中央执行委员会派来参加伟大的中国共产党第八次全国代表大会。
    我们热烈地祝贺大会，并祝亲爱的毛主席、党中央各位同志和代表同志们身体健康。
    这里，我谨宣读我们党中央执行委员会致大会的贺信如下：中国共产党第八次全国代表大会亲爱的同志们：
    我们谨代表越南劳动党和越南人民向中国共产党第八次全国代表大会致以热烈的兄弟般的祝贺。
    中国共产党经过三十五年艰苦和英勇的斗争，领导六亿中国人民取得了对世界有着深刻而广泛影响的历史性胜利。中国革命的辉煌的成就，使得以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的力量占了优势。强大的中华人民共和国今天正稳步地向着建设社会主义和积极保卫亚洲和世界和平的道路前进，这对于各国的民族和民主运动是一个光辉的榜样，对于全世界被压迫民族也是一个强有力的鼓舞。
    我们两国的命运是密切相连的。中国对处于任何环境中的越南所给予的慷慨无私的帮助，是我们两国人民间的深厚友谊和我们两党间的密切的国际团结的最高贵的表现。这种日益增长的友谊团结，是越南民主共和国的发展和繁荣，以及在日内瓦协议基础上为巩固和平和实现越南统一的斗争取得美好前途的可靠保证之一。
    我们在这里再一次表示我们全国人民和全党对中国人民和以敬爱的毛泽东主席为首的中国共产党的深切的感谢。
    中国的实际，证明了以马克思列宁主义武装起来的党所领导的人民群众是有着非凡的力量和巨大的创造性的。天才地将马克思列宁主义运用于中国环境的中国革命的丰富经验更加照亮了越南革命的道路，并对越南人民在民族解放斗争和建设越南人民民主制度的事业中所取得的胜利有着重大的贡献。中国正蓬勃发展的社会主义革命高潮使得全体越南人民愈加振奋，清楚地看到中国的今天就是越南的明天，并且更加满怀信心地为建设一个和平、统一、独立、民主和富强的越南而奋斗。
    亲爱的同志们，越南劳动党中央执行委员会敬祝中国共产党第八次全国代表大会取得辉煌的成就。
    越南劳动党全党和越南全体人民深信，遵循着大会的正确的方针和指示，中国人民将胜利地完成五年经济计划，在中国的社会主义建设的事业中取得巨大的成就，使中国——亚洲和平的堡垒日益巩固。
    不可战胜的马克思列宁主义万岁！
    光荣的中国共产党万岁！
    越南人民和中国人民牢不可破的友谊万岁！
        越南劳动党中央执行委员会　胡志明
                  一九五六年九月十日
