Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, September 29th: The Burmese Deputy Prime Minister U Kyaw Nyein read a statement on the Sino-Burmese border issue to the Chamber of Deputies on the morning of September 28th. The full text is as follows:

    The Government of the Union of Burma considers it necessary to announce a matter of concern to the people, namely the Sino-Burmese border issue. As expressed in the Burmese Government's communiqué of July 31, 1956, consultations and negotiations with the People's Republic of China are progressing well. Such consultations demonstrate the good symbol of the willingness of both governments to resolve issues peacefully in accordance with the five principles commonly accepted. Up to now, as the two governments are still in consultation, the Burmese Government believes that it is not beneficial to publish the progress of the negotiations at this time. However, the Burmese Government believes that it is necessary to issue another communiqué on this important issue at an appropriate time, in order to explain the details to the people of the whole country.

Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, September 29th: Burmese Foreign Minister Sao Khun Hkio said in the Burmese Parliament on September 28th that the negotiations between China and Burma on the border issue are proceeding very smoothly.

    Sao Khun Hkio said that the Burmese government is deeply convinced that this issue will be peacefully resolved in the near future, because the relationship between China and Burma is extremely sincere and both sides are countries that endorse the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

    缅甸政府发表声明说
    中缅边境问题谈判顺利进行
    新华社仰光29日电　缅甸副总理吴觉迎9月28日上午向代表院宣读了一项有关缅中边境问题的声明。全文如下：
    缅甸联邦政府认为有必要宣布一项人民所关怀的事项，即中缅边境问题。正如1956年7月31日缅甸联邦政府的公报里所表示的愿望，同中华人民共和国进行的协商谈判在良好地进展中。这样的协商显示了两国政府愿意按照共同接受的五项原则以和平方式解决问题的良好象征。到现在为止，由于两国政府还在进行协商，缅甸联邦政府认为，在目前发表谈判经过是没有好处的。但是，缅甸联邦政府认为，在适当时期就这项重大问题再发表一个公报，以便向全国人民说明详情是必要的。
    新华社仰光29日电　缅甸外交部部长藻昆卓9月28日在缅甸议会说，中缅两国关于边界问题的谈判进行得非常顺利。
    藻昆卓说，缅甸政府深信这个问题将在最近的将来达成和平解决，因为中缅两国的关系是极端诚挚并且双方都是赞成共处的五项原则的国家。
