Xinhua News Agency Report: Shanghai is building a factory using fly ash, lime, and gypsum to manufacture concrete building components, with construction starting on August 29th.

　　This factory is being built with investment from the Shanghai Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau. Its site was selected near the Yangshupu Power Plant in Shanghai. The power plant's daily cleanup of over one hundred tons of fly ash will be the main raw material for manufacturing concrete components after the factory is completed. Concrete components made from fly ash, lime, gypsum, and other raw materials can withstand pressure of 110 to 140 kilograms per square centimeter, and the compressive strength is about the same as components made with ordinary cement. After the factory is completed, it can produce 40 cubic meters of concrete components per day, saving the country 2,400 tons of cement per year. The equipment required for the factory's production only includes a grinder, a concrete mixer, and a steam boiler for maintaining the concrete components.

　　The Shanghai Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau is also planning to build a factory to manufacture bricks from cinder. The factory site is selected near the Zhabei Power Plant. The factory is equipped with an electric automatic brick-making machine, one of which can produce nearly 100,000 bricks ten times larger than ordinary bricks per day. After the factory is built and put into production, it can use the power plant's cinder to manufacture the equivalent of 100 million ordinary bricks locally each year, to meet the needs of building factories and civil housing.

    上海兴建筹建两座工厂
    一座用烟灰制混凝土
    一座用煤渣制砖头
    据新华社讯　一座用烟灰、石灰、石膏制造混凝土建筑构件的工厂，8月29日在上海动工兴建。
    这座工厂是上海市建筑工程局投资兴建的。它的厂址选择在上海杨树浦发电厂附近，发电厂每日清理出来的一百多吨烟灰，就是这个厂建成后制造混凝土构件的主要原料。用烟灰、石灰、石膏等原料做成的混凝土构件，每平方公分可以承受压力一百一十到一百四十公斤，抗压力同采用普通水泥做成的构件差不多。这个厂建成以后，每天可以生产四十立方公尺的混凝土构件，一年就可以为国家节省二千四百吨水泥。而这个厂生产所需要的设备，只要一台磨粉机、一台混凝土拌和机和一台保养混凝土构件用的蒸汽锅炉就够了。
    上海市建筑工程局还在筹建一座用煤渣来制造砖头的工厂。这个厂的厂址选择在闸北发电厂附近。厂里安装的电气自动制砖机，有一台每天能生产近十万块比普通砖大十倍的砖头。这个厂建成投入生产以后，利用发电厂的煤渣，每年可以就地制造相等于一万万块普通砖的砖头，供应建筑厂房和民用房屋的需要。
