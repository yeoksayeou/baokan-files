Xinhua News Agency, 11th - TASS reports: At a mass meeting in Moscow on September 9th, held by the working people to protest the West German authorities' ban on the German Communist Party, Max Reimann, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the German Communist Party, said that it is impossible to eliminate and eradicate from the lives of the working class and the people a party whose interests and goals are consistent with those of the working class and the people. It is impossible to eliminate a party whose activities are aimed at striving for the happiness and welfare of all working people. Such a party can never be eliminated because it is impossible to eliminate the working class, it is impossible to eliminate the people. He said, "The German workers' party proved this during the Bismarck era. It proved this during the Hitler period through its self-sacrificing underground struggle against fascism and against imperialist war."

In his speech, Max Reimann pointed out that in 1933, the Hitlerite German fascists embarked on the road to launching World War II by banning the German Communist Party. Now, the fact that German militarists have banned the German Communist Party shows that German imperialists and militarists have not learned any lessons from history and intend to drag the German people and all of Europe into a bloody massacre once again.

Max Reimann said that the implementation of universal conscription, the banning of the German Communist Party, and the revanchist cries of German militarists are an alarm to the people of all countries that were once occupied by Hitler.

The banning of the German Communist Party shows that the ruling clique of the Federal Republic does not want to reunify Germany into a peaceful and democratic country, but wants to seize the German Democratic Republic by force.

German imperialists and militarists, like Hitler, are preparing for war through frantic chauvinistic propaganda and by waving the old and dirty anti-communist banner. But historical experience shows that whoever takes anti-communism as the guiding light of their policy is digging their own grave. The development of Germany and the world shows that the time when German imperialists could imagine they were omnipotent has passed forever.

The German people have not forgotten the painful experience of the twelve years of Hitler's dictatorship, nor have they forgotten the tragic lessons of World War II. Therefore, the implementation of universal conscription and the banning of the German Communist Party have aroused protests and anger from the West German working class and all peace-loving people. Moreover, the scope of rule of German imperialism and militarism is currently limited. In the German Democratic Republic, workers and peasants have become masters of their own affairs and are building socialism under the leadership of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany. German imperialists can never take away power and their victorious achievements from the workers and peasants, and they can never again drive the people to suffer the enslavement of German militarism. If those imperialists who feel disadvantaged in the peaceful competition between the two systems in Germany dare to take the path of violence, this will inevitably lead to their complete failure. Max Reimann said, "The banning of the German Communist Party is not a sign of strength of German imperialists, but a sign of its constant weakness. German imperialists are trying to maintain their rule by resorting to adventurous and criminal methods such as banning the German Communist Party and taking terrorist measures.

"But wherever there is a working class and a people, wherever people are fighting for their social and national interests, for peace, freedom and progress, there will be communists."

He said: "In order to achieve these goals, we communists extend our hands to all our class brothers, especially our Social Democratic comrades, and to all progressive people and patriots in our country." "We should draw a great lesson from history. That lesson is: whenever the working class is divided, it only benefits the enemies of the working class and the people; whenever the working class can unite its ranks, the attacks of militarism and reactionary forces can be repelled, and the working class and the people will surely win."

Max Reimann finally said that the solidarity and proletarian internationalism shown by the working people of all countries against the tyranny of German imperialists against our party and the German working class are great. This solidarity and proletarian internationalism strengthens our forces and obliges us to strengthen our efforts to oppose German militarism, strive for peace, freedom and friendship among the peoples of all countries, and strive to realize the social and national aspirations of our people that are in line with the peaceful interests of all countries.

### 雷曼在莫斯科群众大会上说  德国共产党是消灭不了的

    雷曼在莫斯科群众大会上说
    德国共产党是消灭不了的
    新华社11日讯　据塔斯社报道：德国共产党中央委员会第一书记马克斯·雷曼9日在莫斯科劳动人民为抗议西德当局禁止德国共产党而举行的群众大会上说，要想把一个利益和目标是同工人阶级和人民的利益和目标一致的党从工人阶级和人民的生活中消除和根绝是不可能的。要想把一个活动是为了为争取全体劳动人民的幸福和福利而斗争的党消灭是不可能的。这样的党决不可能消灭，因为决不可能消灭工人阶级，决不可能消灭人民。他说，“德国工人阶级的政党在俾斯麦时代已经证明了这一点。它在希特勒时期以反对法西斯主义和反对帝国主义战争的自我牺牲的地下斗争证明了这一点”。
    马克斯·雷曼在讲话中指出，1933年希特勒德国法西斯分子就是以取缔德国共产党开始走上发动第二次世界大战道路的。现在，德国军国主义者禁止德国共产党一事表明，德国帝国主义者和军国主义者丝毫没有从历史上取得教训，他们打算再次把德国人民和整个欧洲拖入血腥的屠戮中。
    马克斯·雷曼说，实行普遍义务兵役制、取缔德国共产党、德国军国主义者复仇的喊叫，这是对曾经遭到希特勒占领的各国人民发出的警报。
    取缔德国共产党一事表明，联邦共和国统治集团不希望使德国重新统一成为一个和平和民主的国家，而想要强占德意志民主共和国。
    德国帝国主义者和军国主义者想像希特勒一样靠疯狂的沙文主义宣传和打着陈旧肮脏的反共旗帜来准备战争。但是历史经验说明：谁要是把反共当作自己的政策的指路灯，谁就是在替自己掘坟墓。德国和全世界的发展表明，德国帝国主义者可以设想他们无所不能的时候已经永远过去了。
    德国人民没有忘记希特勒专政十二年的痛苦经验，没有忘记第二次世界大战的惨痛教训。所以，普遍兵役制的实行和对德国共产党的取缔引起了西德工人阶级和一切爱好和平的人的抗议和愤怒。而且，德国帝国主义和军国主义的统治范围目前是有限的。在德意志民主共和国，工人和农民已经当家作主，并且在德国统一社会党的领导下建设社会主义。德国帝国主义者决不可能从工农手中夺去政权和他们的胜利果实，决不可能又一次驱使人民去遭受德国军国主义的奴役。如果那些在德国两个制度的和平竞赛中感到居于劣势的帝国主义者胆敢走上采用暴力的道路，那么这必然会使他们遭到彻底的失败。马克斯·雷曼说，“取缔德国共产党，不是德国帝国主义者有力的表现，而是它不断软弱的表现。德国帝国主义者企图靠取缔德共和采取恐怖措施这种冒险和犯罪的办法来维持自己的统治。
     “但是，只要有工人阶级和有人民的地方，只要是在人们为自己的社会利益和民族利益、为和平、自由和进步而奋斗的地方，就会有共产党人。”
    他说：“我们共产党人为了实现这些目的，向我们的全体阶级兄弟，首先是我们的社会民主党同志，我国全体进步人士和爱国者伸出了手。”“我们应当从历史中吸取巨大的教训。这个教训就是：无论何时，只要工人阶级处于分裂状态，就只对工人阶级和人民的敌人有利；无论何时，只要工人阶级能团结起自己的队伍，军国主义和反动势力的攻击就一定能被打退，工人阶级和人民一定会取得胜利。”
    马克斯·雷曼最后说，世界各国劳动人民针对德国帝国主义者反对我们党和德国工人阶级的横暴行为所表现出来的团结和无产阶级国际主义是伟大的。这种团结和无产阶级国际主义增强了我们的力量，责成我们必须加强努力，为反对德国军国主义、争取和平、自由和各国人民的友谊、争取实现符合一切国家的和平利益的我国人民的社会和民族愿望。
