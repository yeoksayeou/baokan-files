Xinhua News Agency, 28th: Premier of the State Council Zhou Enlai held a grand banquet this evening to host Soviet and other People's Democratic Countries experts in Beijing who are assisting our country in its construction.

　　The banquet began at 5 p.m. Premier Zhou Enlai rose to speak amidst applause. On the eve of the seventh anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, Premier Zhou Enlai, on behalf of the Chinese government and people, expressed heartfelt gratitude and respect to the experts from the Soviet Union and other countries, and to the Soviet government and the governments of other People's Democratic Countries for sending experts to China to help with construction. Premier Zhou Enlai said: The fourth year of our country's first Five-Year Plan is coming to an end. It now seems that it is possible to overfulfill this Five-Year Plan. Due to the smooth implementation of the first Five-Year Plan, our country has made significant achievements on the road from a backward agricultural country to an advanced socialist industrial country. This is not only the result of the active labor of the Chinese people, but also inseparable from the enthusiastic help of experts from the Soviet Union and People's Democratic countries. Please allow me to once again express my heartfelt gratitude for your fraternal assistance, which is full of internationalist spirit.

　　Premier Zhou Enlai continued: Recently, the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China passed the proposal for our country's second Five-Year Plan. This new plan proposal, based on the various achievements already achieved during the first Five-Year Plan, puts forward even more enormous tasks to our people. In order to further enhance our socialist construction cause, we must learn more modestly from the Soviet Union and other People's Democratic countries, learn from your advanced construction experience, and master science and technology faster in order to better complete our construction tasks. Finally, Premier Zhou Enlai proposed a toast to the great friendship between the Chinese people and the people of the great Soviet Union and People's Democratic countries, to the increasing prosperity and strength of the peace, democracy, and socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and to the health of the Soviet and other People's Democratic countries' experts and their wives working in our country!

　　Soviet economic adviser Arkhipov spoke at the banquet, congratulating the People's Republic of China on its seventh National Day. He said: I assure you that the Soviet experts and the experts from People's Democratic countries working in China will dedicate all their strength, all their experience and knowledge to help your great construction, in order to fulfill their internationalist obligations.

　　Arkhipov continued: The great and unbreakable friendship unites the people of our countries. This friendship expresses a sincere desire to help each other and seek common advancement. To fight for the construction of a socialist and communist society is our common internationalist cause. He finally proposed a toast to the new and great achievements of the Chinese brothers and friends, and to the progress and prosperity of the People's Republic of China!

　　During the banquet, Premier Zhou also went to the seats of experts from various countries to toast the experts and their wives, and congratulated the experts on their continuous new achievements in helping China's construction work.

　　The Soviet Communist Party delegation, the Polish United Workers' Party delegation, the German Socialist Unity Party delegation, the Czechoslovak Communist Party delegation, the Korean Workers' Party delegation, and the Vietnamese Workers' Party delegation attending the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China were invited to attend the banquet.

　　Those attending the banquet included Soviet Ambassador Academician Yudin, Soviet Economic Advisor Arkhipov, Cultural and Educational Advisor Malyshev, as well as Soviet experts and their wives in Beijing.
