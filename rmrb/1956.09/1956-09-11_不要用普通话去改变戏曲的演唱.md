    Do Not Use Mandarin to Change the Performance of Opera
    Yan Jiusi
    Recently, at the evening party of the First National Music Week, the Central Conservatory of Music's East China Branch performed the Huangmei Opera "Playing with Pigweed." This was a small song and dance drama performed in Mandarin, accompanied by an orchestra, featuring solos, duets, and double duets. The melodies of the Huangmei Opera were retained, with some adaptations by the composer. After the performance, it sparked heated debates among some people in the music and opera circles. The focus of the debate was: is this approach the direction of future opera development? Some affirmed it as the direction, while others denied it.
    Among the opinions of those who affirmed it as the direction, there was an argument that the operas currently performed in dialects would all be changed to Mandarin in the future, and this opera, performed in Mandarin, therefore represents a direction in this respect. It is worth noting that this kind of statement is not only seen in discussions, but has also influenced the performance practice of some opera troupes. Therefore, a few words must be said on this issue.
    As everyone knows, there are more than two hundred kinds of operas in our country, each with its own unique style and strong local color. One of the factors that constitute the different styles and characteristics of opera is the local color of their language. Different operas are sung in different dialects, which greatly influences the pronunciation of the dialogue, as well as the formation of the singing, music, and its style. Obviously, the use of dialects in singing is not an isolated phenomenon in opera art. If the current operas no longer use dialects to sing, and are all changed to Mandarin, it will inevitably, to a certain extent, cause changes in the characteristics and style of the original singing art of the opera.
    Of course, this does not mean that language standardization has nothing to do with opera. Nor does it mean that after local operas are sung in Mandarin, their dialogue, singing, and music will change into one tone, just like everyone speaking Mandarin. With the gradual promotion of Mandarin among the masses, and the gradual unification of the Chinese language, opera language cannot but be influenced by standardized Chinese. This is certain. The question is: should opera language follow its own laws, adapt to the appreciation habits of the vast audience, and gradually and preparedly accept this influence, and promote the further enrichment and color of language, singing, and music, or should we artificially and prematurely use Mandarin to change its dialect singing? Naturally, it can only be the former, and should not be the latter. Otherwise, it will cause confusion.
    The use of Mandarin in opera is by no means a simple matter. This is a complex and delicate work that requires prudent, in-depth, and meticulous research based on the specific conditions of different types of opera. It is not only an academic issue, but also, first and foremost, a policy issue, a mass viewpoint issue. It not only relates to how to correctly treat the national artistic heritage and the appreciation habits of the masses, but also relates to the vital interests of the artists and their lives. A tea-picking opera troupe in Jiangxi Province once sang in Mandarin, and as a result, there were very few audience members, so they had to change back; the Yong Opera Troupe in Nanning, Guangxi Province, originally sang in Cantonese, but recently changed to Guilin Mandarin (only Guilin Mandarin), which also greatly reduced the scope of the audience, and now they have to consider changing back. These are all examples that can illustrate the problem.
    The Ministry of Culture issued a notice in April this year on implementing the State Council's instructions on promoting Mandarin, which clearly stipulated: "For the singing of Peking Opera, other local operas, local folk art forms, folk songs, etc., do not use Mandarin to change them for the time being, but Mandarin can be gradually promoted among the actors who sing them. All localities must strictly control this issue and not use the requirements for spoken drama and new opera to require Peking Opera, local opera, local folk art forms, and folk songs, so as to avoid confusion." This instruction is completely correct.
    Then, was the Huangmei Opera "Playing with Pigweed" mentioned above, sung in Mandarin, the right thing to do, or the wrong thing to do? We believe that an art school and other national opera groups with conditions and experimental tasks should not reject this kind of experiment. For internal research, this experiment is completely possible and necessary. It's just that we should not arbitrarily introduce our own experience, let alone promote it in various local opera troupes.

    不要用普通话去改变戏曲的演唱
    严九思
    最近在第一届全国音乐周的晚会上，中央音乐学院华东分院演出了黄梅戏“打猪草”。这是一出用普通话演唱、用管弦乐队伴奏、有独唱、对唱、二重唱的小歌舞剧，唱腔还沿用黄梅戏原有的曲调，由作曲者作了一些改编。演出后，在音乐界和戏曲界的一部分人中间，引起了热烈的争论。争论的焦点是：这样的做法，是否就是今后戏曲发展的方向。有肯定是方向的，也有否定的。
    在肯定是方向的一派的意见里，有这么一个论据，即认为：现在用方言演唱的戏曲，将来是要统统用普通话改过来的，这出戏是用普通话演唱的，所以在这一点上说，它也代表着一种方向。值得注意的是，这种言论不仅见诸讨论，并且已经在一些戏曲剧团的演出实践中发生了影响。所以就这个问题，不能不说几句话。
    大家知道，我国戏曲多到两百多种，每一种戏曲都有它自己的独特的风格和浓厚的地方色彩。构成戏曲的不同的风格和特点的因素之一，就是它们的语言的地方色彩。不同的戏曲用不同的方言来演唱，这在很大程度上影响到这个剧种的道白的声韵，影响到唱腔、音乐及其风格的形成。显然，用方言演唱这件事，在戏曲艺术中，不是一个孤立的现象。如果现在的戏曲，都不再使用方言来演唱了，统统都用普通话改过来，不可避免地将在一定程度上，引起戏曲原有演唱艺术的特点和风格的变化。
    当然，这决不是说，汉语规范化可以与戏曲无关。也不是说，地方戏曲用普通话演唱以后，它的道白、唱腔、音乐会像人人都说普通话一样，改变成一个调调。随着普通话在群众中的逐步推广，汉语的逐渐趋于统一，戏曲语言不能不受到规范化的汉语的影响，这是可以肯定的。问题是在于：戏曲语言是应当循着自己的规律，适应广大观众的欣赏习惯，逐渐地有准备地来接受这种影响，并且促进语言、唱腔、音乐的更加丰富，更有色彩呢，还是人为地、过早地用普通话去改变它的方言的演唱？自然，这只能是前者，而不应当是后者。否则就会引起混乱。
    在戏曲中运用普通话，决不是一件简单的事。这是一件复杂细致的工作，需要根据不同剧种的具体情况进行审慎的、深入的、细致的研究。它不但是一个学术问题，而且首先是一个政策问题，群众观点问题。它不但关系到如何正确地对待民族艺术遗产，对待群众的欣赏习惯，而且关系到艺人的切身利益，关系到他们的生活。江西省有个采茶剧团，曾经一度用普通话演唱，结果观众寥寥可数，不得不又改回来；广西省南宁的邕剧团原是用广东话演唱的，不久前改用桂林官话（只是桂林官话），结果也大大地缩小了观众的范围，现在也不得不考虑改回来。这都是很能说明问题的例子。
    文化部在今年4月间发出了关于贯彻国务院关于推广普通话的指示的通知曾经明确规定：“对于京剧、其他地方戏曲、地方曲艺、民歌等的演唱，目前不要用普通话去改变它们，但是可以在演唱它们的演员中间逐步推广普通话。各地在这个问题上必须严格掌握，不要以对于话剧、新歌剧的要求，去要求京剧、地方戏曲、地方曲艺、民歌，以免发生混乱。”这个指示是完全正确的。
    那末，上面提到的黄梅戏“打猪草”，用普通话演唱，这究竟是做对了，还是做错了？我们认为：作为一个艺术学校以及其他有条件的负有实验任务的国家戏曲团体，不应当排斥这种实验。为了进行内部研究，这种实验是完全可以而且必要的。只是不要任意去介绍自己的经验，更不能随便在各地方戏曲剧团中推广。
