Xinhua News Agency, 4th dispatch from Baguio: The military advisors of the Manila Treaty Organization began a secret meeting on September 3rd in Baguio, Philippines. The meeting is scheduled to last for six days.

Participating in the meeting are Admiral Stump, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Navy in the Pacific, Air Marshal Fressanges, Commander-in-Chief of the British Far East Air Force, and military representatives from France, Australia, New Zealand, Pakistan, Thailand, and the Philippines, totaling sixty-eight people.

The chairman of the meeting, Philippine representative Vargas, announced that the main task of this meeting is to review the "research work" completed by the military staff planning personnel of this military bloc at a meeting held in Singapore in June of this year.

U.S. chief representative Stump said that the Manila Treaty Organization still has a lot of work to do. In his speech, he attacked socialist countries and intimidated countries pursuing a neutral policy.

The aggressive planning work orchestrated by the United States to formulate the Manila Treaty Organization's military deployments in Southeast Asia officially began at the first military staff planning personnel meeting in April last year. The plans they drafted at that meeting were approved by the first military advisors meeting in July last year, and the military staff planning personnel held another meeting in November last year for further discussion. Subsequently, for this plan, a second military advisors meeting was convened in January this year, and a third military staff planning personnel meeting was convened in June this year.

This meeting is the third meeting of the military advisors of this military bloc. The meeting will put forward recommendations on the report of the last military staff planning personnel meeting and submit it to the Manila Treaty Organization Council meeting scheduled to be held in Bangkok next year for review.

    马尼拉集团军事顾问密商侵略计划
    美国代表诬蔑社会主义国家并恫吓中立国家
    据新华社4日讯　碧瑶消息：马尼拉条约组织的军事顾问9月3日在菲律宾的碧瑶举行秘密会议。会议预定举行六天。
    参加这个会议的有太平洋美国海军总司令斯图普、英国驻远东空军总司令弗里森吉斯以及法国、澳大利亚、新西兰、巴基斯坦、泰国和菲律宾的军事代表等六十八人。
    会议主席、菲律宾代表瓦加斯宣布，这次会议的主要任务就是审查这个军事集团的军事参谋计划人员今年六月在新加坡举行的会议上所完成的“研究工作”。
    美国首席代表斯图普说，马尼拉条约组织还要做很多工作。他在发言中攻击社会主义国家，并且恫吓奉行中立政策的国家。
    美国策划的拟订马尼拉条约组织在东南亚进行军事部署的侵略性计划工作，是在去年4月间第一次军事参谋计划人员会议上正式开始的。在那次会议上他们所拟订的计划，经过去年7月的第一次军事顾问会议批准后，军事参谋计划人员又在去年11月举行会议作进一步的讨论。随后为了这个计划，又在今年1月间召开了第二次军事顾问会议，今年6月间召开了第三次军事参谋计划人员会议。
    这次会议是这个军事集团的军事顾问的第三次会议，会上将就上次军事参谋计划人员的报告提出建议，提交预定明年在曼谷举行的马尼拉条约组织理事会会议审查。
