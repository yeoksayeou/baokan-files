    National Railway Science Work Conference Concludes
    Discussion of Long-Range Plan for Railway Science and Technology Development

    According to Xinhua News Agency, the National Railway Science Work Conference concluded on the 29th.

    This Railway Science Work Conference focused on discussing the outline of the long-range plan for railway science and technology development from 1956 to 1967. At the meeting, the representatives had many debates about the direction of scientific research. The main question was whether the method of improving railway transportation capacity should focus on tapping potential or adopting new technologies. After heated discussions, the representatives reached a consensus: at present, China's railway technology and equipment are very backward. If new technologies are not adopted, the backward state of railway technology and equipment cannot be fundamentally changed, and the railway transportation capacity cannot be fundamentally strengthened, nor can the construction of new railways be accelerated to adapt to the development of the national economy. Of course, while emphasizing new technologies, the utilization, transformation and tapping the potential of existing equipment should not be ignored; the role of improving labor organization and simple mechanized operations in improving labor productivity and reducing physical labor should not be underestimated; special attention should also be paid to and valued the creations of employees, even the smallest creations should be cherished.

    According to China's railway technical transformation policy, national resources and industrial level, and the technical achievements already achieved by countries around the world, the meeting believes that the direction of railway scientific research in the future is to adopt mechanized, electrified, and automated equipment in a step-by-step, focused, and planned manner. That is, gradually use electric locomotives, gas turbine locomotives, or internal combustion locomotives with strong transport capacity to replace the old steam locomotives; adopt automated signaling equipment and centralized dispatching devices, and build mechanically operated hump marshalling yards. In new road construction, use long rails and concrete sleepers; adopt mechanized and industrialized construction methods to reduce workers' physical labor, and use aerial surveying to speed up the speed of surveying and design.

    Regarding the allocation and arrangement of research forces, the meeting believes that not only should long-term issues be studied, but also issues that need to be resolved urgently in on-site production. Not only should full-time research institutions be enriched, but also research bases should be established appropriately. Experts and engineers should be mobilized, and all employees should be called upon to participate in and value scientific research work, so as to gradually form a scientific research network in the national railway.

    A total of 448 scientific workers, engineers, advanced workers, and technical leading cadres from railways across the country participated in this conference. The conference received 316 papers and experience summaries.

    全国铁道科学工作会议闭幕
    讨论铁道科学技术发展远景规划
    据新华社讯　全国铁道科学工作会议已经在29日闭幕。
    这次铁道科学工作会议着重地讨论了1956到1967年的铁道科学技术发展远景规划纲要。会上代表们对于科学研究的方向问题有很多争论。最主要的问题是，提高铁路运输能力的方法究竟应以挖掘潜力为主，还是以采用新技术为主？经过热烈的讨论之后，代表们有了一致认识：目前我国铁路的技术装备十分落后，如果不采用新技术，便不能从根本上改变铁路技术装备的落后状态，也就不能从根本上加强铁路运输力量和加速新铁路的建设，来适应国民经济的发展。当然在强调新技术的同时，也不能忽视现有设备的利用改造和发挥潜力问题；不应看轻改进劳动组织和简单机械化作业对于提高劳动生产率和减轻体力劳动的作用；还要特别注意和重视职工的创造，哪怕是极微小的创造也要爱护。
    根据我国铁路技术改造方针，国家资源和工业水平，以及世界各国已经取得的技术成就，会议认为今后铁道科学研究的方向是有步骤、有重点、有计划地采用机械化、电气化、自动化设备。即逐步地采用运输力强大的电气化机车、燃气输机车或内燃机车代替古老的蒸汽机车；采用自动化信号设备和集中调度装置，修建机械操纵的驼峰调车场。在新路建设方面运用长钢轨和混凝土轨枕；采用机械化和工厂化施工方法以减轻工人体力劳动，采用航空勘测以加速勘测设计的速度。
    关于研究力量的分配和安排问题，会议认为不仅要研究长远的问题，也要注意现场生产迫待解决的问题，不仅要充实专职研究机构，也要适当建立研究据点，要动员专家和工程师，还要号召全体职工参加和重视科学研究工作，以便逐渐在全国铁路形成一个科学研究网。
    参加这次会议的有全国铁路四四八个科学工作者、工程师、先进工作者和技术领导干部。会议收到的论文和经验总结有三一六篇。
