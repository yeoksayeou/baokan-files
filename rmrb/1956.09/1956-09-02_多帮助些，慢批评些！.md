    More Help, Less Criticism!
    Jin Xueliang
    At a symposium on public-private relations held by a certain government agency, representatives from the public side voiced their grievances. They described themselves as being "bullied from above and below, and in a difficult position no matter which way they turn." Amidst calls for improving public-private relations, the plight of the public representatives is so difficult, which naturally aroused deep concern.
    Public representatives in joint public-private enterprises have a heavy burden, as they must represent the state in managing production and transforming enterprises, while also representing the state in uniting, educating, and transforming private personnel. At the same time, public representatives come from all directions, and some of them are not yet very familiar with transformation policies and business, so it is obvious that they will encounter difficulties in their work.
    However, it seems that the grievances of the public representatives in public-private cooperation are not limited to this. Let's cite some examples:
    For example, allowing private personnel to participate in necessary meetings is one way to ensure that they have authority and responsibility. However, some leading departments, regardless of the meeting's topic, always notify that "public representatives must attend." As a result, public representatives have to attend meetings and take charge of everything from production plans to eliminating the four pests. Private personnel, dissatisfied with the public's monopolization and substitution, started writing doggerel poems like "Public representatives are busy day and night, while we have nothing to do but bask in the sun."
    For example, public-private cooperation inevitably involves interaction, but getting close to private personnel in life can also lead to gossip. If you get too close, the employees will misunderstand and worry that you will lose your stance; if you don't get close enough, the private personnel will have opinions and criticize you for being "too polite and not helpful enough."
    For example, joint public-private enterprises also face special difficulties in contacting other units for work. A cadre from a processing and ordering department in Shanghai once said directly to a public representative: "We earn one yuan, and we turn it all over to the state. You earn two yuan, and the capitalists get one." After hearing this, the public representative also had concerns about actively engaging in business, fearing that they would be accused of "jointly operating for private gain."
    Under the threat of "monopolization and substitution," "losing one's stance," and "jointly operating for private gain"... the work of public representatives can be described as "difficult, indeed."
    But the problem doesn't stop there. The greater difficulty for public representatives lies in the fact that many competent departments are more enthusiastic about criticizing their subordinates than helping them. These departments are often "not very familiar with the specific situation" regarding the difficulties of their subordinate public representatives; they often "cannot offer specific opinions" regarding the assistance needed by public representatives; and they often say that the requests for instructions sent by public representatives are "under study." Strangely, they eagerly adopt methods such as naming names at large meetings, issuing circulars of criticism, and conducting in-depth inspections to deal with things as soon as they hear any feedback. Of course, no one denies that criticism and inspection are necessary for improving work when there are shortcomings or mistakes in the work. However, what is puzzling is: why is specific help so little and so slow, while criticism and inspection are so much and so fast?

    多帮助些，慢批评些！
    金学良
    在某机关召开的一次讨论公私共事关系的座谈会上，听到了公方代表们倾吐的苦衷。他们形容自己是“上下受气，左右为难。”在改进公私共事关系声中，公方代表的处境如此难堪，自然引起了人们深切的关心。
    公私合营企业的公方代表，既要代表国家管理生产、改造企业，又要代表国家团结、教育和改造私方人员，这副担子确是十分沉重。同时公方代表来自四面八方，其中有的对于改造政策和业务一时还不很熟悉，这样，工作有困难是显然的。
    可是，看来公方代表们在公私共事方面的苦衷并不仅仅在此。还是举些实例来说吧：
    譬如，让私方人员参加必要的会议，是保证他们有职有权的办法之一。但是，有些领导部门不管开什么会议，都是通知“务必由公方代表出席”。于是，公方代表从生产计划到消除四害，事事都要去开会、去掌握，而私方人员却在不满公方包办代替之余，作起“公方代表日夜忙，我们无事晒太阳”的打油诗来。
    又譬如，公私共事总得要互相往来，谁知在生活上和私方人员接近也会有不少口舌。多接近一些吧，职工不谅解，担心你失掉立场；少接近一点吧，私方人员有意见，批评你“客气有余，帮助不足”。
    再譬如，公私合营企业和其他单位联系工作，也存在着特殊困难。上海有一个加工订货部门的干部就曾经直接了当地对某公方代表说：“我们赚一个钱，全部上缴。你们赚两个钱，就有资本家一个”。这话一讲，公方代表对于积极经营业务也有了顾虑，唯恐再犯了“合公营私”的嫌疑。
    公方代表在“包办代替”“失掉立场”“合公营私”……舆论威胁下，工作可谓“难矣哉”。
    但是问题还不在此，公方代表更大的困难是在于有不少主管部门对于批评下级总比帮助下级来得热心。这些部门对于所属公方代表的困难，常常是“不很了解具体情况”；对于公方代表所需要的帮助，常常是“提不出具体意见来”；对于公方代表送来的请示，常常是“正在研究中”。说也奇怪，他们偏偏是在听到什么反映时，便急不可待地采取大会点名啊，通报批评啊，深入检查啊等等办法抓紧处理起来了。自然，谁都不否认当工作中有了缺点或错误时，批评、检查对于改进工作是必要的。不过，令人不解的是：具体帮助为何又少又慢，而批评检查却又多又快呢？
