Xinhua News Agency, Brighton, September 4th. The 88th Annual Meeting of the British Trades Union Congress opened in Brighton on September 3rd. One thousand delegates from 186 trade unions, representing 8,260,000 organized workers, will hold a five-day meeting in this beautiful seaside city to discuss the report of the Trades Union Congress General Council and 89 proposals submitted by various trade unions. The main items of these proposals include many issues closely related to the vital interests of workers, such as wage issues, automation issues, the Suez Canal issue and further easing of the international situation, international trade union movement issues, and so on.

Preliminary discussions on wage issues conducted before the opening of the annual meeting indicated that the annual meeting would reject the wage restriction demands made by Chancellor of the Exchequer Macmillan. Macmillan warned last week that Britain's gold and dollar reserves would be significantly reduced in August. He used the excuse of "not jeopardizing current price stability" to demand that the Trades Union Congress not demand wage increases.

Another issue that has attracted great attention at the conference is the issue of automation. The conference is drafting several proposals that emphasize that workers should not be harmed by automation and demand full employment.

Regarding the Suez Canal issue, the conference will hold discussions around a proposal that calls for no use of force against Egypt unless the issue is brought before the United Nations and receives the United Nations' approval. Some workers believe this proposal is not good enough and believe that force should not be used at all.

Regarding the issue of international trade union relations, some proposals are being drafted that support strengthening the relationship between the British Trades Union Congress and Soviet trade unions, and advocate the establishment of ties between the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions and the World Federation of Trade Unions.

    英国职工大会第八十八届年会开幕
    据新华社布莱顿4日电　英国职工大会第八十八届年会9月3日在布莱顿开幕。来自一百八十六个工会、代表八百二十六万有组织工人的一千个代表将在这座美丽的海滨城市举行五天会议，讨论职工大会最高委员会的报告和各工会提出的八十九项提案。这些提案的主要项目包括许多同工人的切身利益攸关的问题，例如工资问题、自动化问题、苏彝士运河问题和进一步缓和国际局势问题、国际工会运动问题等等。
    在年会开幕以前进行的关于工资问题的初步讨论，表明这次年会将拒绝财政大臣麦克米伦提出的关于限制工资的要求。麦克米伦在上星期曾经警告说，英国8月份的黄金美元储备将大量减少。他以“不要危害目前的物价稳定”为借口，要求职工大会不要要求提高工资。
    引起大会很大注意的另一个问题是自动化问题。大会正在草拟若干提案，这些提案强调职工不应当受自动化之害，并且要求充分就业。
    关于苏彝士运河问题，大会将环绕着一项提案进行讨论，这项提案要求不要使用武力来对付埃及，除非这个问题提到联合国而且得到联合国的同意。有些工人认为这个提案不够好，他们认为根本就不应当使用武力。
    关于国际工会关系问题，有人正在草拟一些提案，这些提案赞成加强英国职工大会和苏联工会的关系，并且主张国际自由工会联合会和世界工会联合会建立联系。
