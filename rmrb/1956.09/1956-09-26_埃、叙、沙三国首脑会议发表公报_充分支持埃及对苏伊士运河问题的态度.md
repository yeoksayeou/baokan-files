Xinhua News Agency, September 25th, Cairo dispatch: The heads of state of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Syria announced their unanimous "full support for all attitudes adopted by Egypt and support for Egypt's announced willingness to reach a peaceful solution sufficient to safeguard Egypt's national interests and in accordance with the purposes of the United Nations."

The heads of the three states issued a joint communiqué after holding meetings in Dammam and the capital Riyadh of Saudi Arabia from September 22nd to 24th, stating, "The meeting specifically discussed the Suez Canal issue. Complete consensus was reached on the following point: this issue, along with the circumstances and environment related to it, is a matter of concern to all Arab countries."

The joint communiqué, simultaneously released in Riyadh, Cairo, and Damascus on September 24th, also pointed out: "The meeting believes that the way to guarantee the interests of all relevant countries in navigation of the Suez Canal is to initiate negotiations with Egypt, the owner of the canal, within the spirit of the United Nations Charter, the Bandung Conference resolutions, without any kind of pressure, and without any intention to forcibly and unilaterally resolve the issue."

The joint communiqué stated: "The meeting proudly records this close and unbreakable Arab unity. This allows the participants of these meetings to recognize the gravity of the responsibilities they bear due to the current crisis. This makes them more confident to face all the obstacles they encounter, which are intended to prevent the Arab nation from realizing its rights and aspirations."

This meeting was the second meeting between Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser, Syrian President Shukri al-Quwatli, and Saudi Arabian King Saud, the first meeting being held in Cairo on March 7, 1956.

Also participating in the meeting were Saudi Arabian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Faisal bin Abdulaziz, Syrian Foreign Minister Bitar, and Director of the Political Bureau of the Egyptian Presidential Office, Sabri, and others.
