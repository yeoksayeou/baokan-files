    This Is Also “Impolite” Behavior

    In the People's Daily, August 20th, fourth page, Zhang Zixin's article "An Impolite Person," in "Voices of the Masses" is plagiarized.

    The article is written as follows: When getting off the bus, the man said to his female companion: "Be careful, dear, it's difficult to walk here..." At that moment, he pushed away an old lady standing by the door, and rudely shouted: "Where are you squeezing to! Are you blind? Didn't you see people getting off the bus!"

    Please see Soviet writer V. Polyakov's "On Politeness." This article has the following passage: A male citizen walked out of the carriage and said to his female companion, "Be careful, dear, it's very high here." At that moment, he pushed away an elderly woman standing by the door with his elbow, and shouted loudly: "Where are you squeezing to? Are you blind? Didn't you see people getting off the bus?" (See page 32 of the book "Several Questions on the Cultivation of Youth Qualities," published by China Youth Publishing House).

    Such plagiarism should also be said to be a kind of "impolite" behavior.

### 这也是“没有礼貌”的行为

    这也是“没有礼貌”的行为
    人民日报八月二十日第四版“群众呼声”中，张自新写的“没有礼貌的人”一文，是抄袭来的。
    这篇文章是这样写的：在下车的时候，男的对他的女伴说：“当心点，亲爱的，这里很难走………。”就在这个时候，他用手推开了站在门旁的一位老大娘，并且蛮横地叫道：“你往哪里钻啊！眼睛瞎啦，没有看见人家要下车吗！”
    请看苏联波略柯夫的“谈礼貌”一文。这篇文章有这样一段话：有一个男公民从车厢里走出去，还对他的女伴说：“当心点走，亲爱的，这里很高。”就在这时，他却用肘子去推开站在车门旁一位上了年纪的老婆婆，并且大声叫喊道：“你往哪里钻啊？眼睛瞎啦？没有看见人家要下车吗？”（见“关于青年品质修养的几个问题”一书第三十二页，中国青年出版社出版）
    这样抄袭别人的文章，也应该说是一种“没有礼貌”的行为。
