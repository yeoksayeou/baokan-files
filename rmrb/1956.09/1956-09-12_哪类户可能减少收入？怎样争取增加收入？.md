Rural Survey

    The six advanced agricultural production cooperatives of Mazhi, Lianhua, Xima, Yangchang, Pingxi, and Bajiang in Longli County, Guizhou Province, have a total of 3,592 member households. They conducted a trial calculation of the annual distribution in July. The trial calculation results showed that if they can complete this year's agricultural and sideline production plan, 87% of households will increase their income, 1.47% will have no change, and 414 households will see a decrease in income, accounting for 11.53%.

    These households with reduced income can be divided into the following categories:
      (1) Households that have lost their labor force or have a large population but a weak labor force used to have some income from land rent. This year, they are paid entirely based on labor, resulting in reduced income. There are 178 such households, mostly widowers, widows, orphans, and the childless.
      (2) Households with a lot of land but a weak labor force, or whose labor force is strong but still cannot match the income from renting out part of their land, resulting in reduced income, account for 142 households. These households are mostly rich peasants or well-to-do middle peasants.
    (3) Small merchants and peddlers who have newly joined the agricultural cooperative and are not familiar with agricultural production, although they often work, earn fewer work points, while their past sideline income was higher, and now their sideline income has decreased. There are 51 households with reduced income in this category.
      (4) The remaining households are those that have suffered unexpected disasters that have reduced their income, such as the main labor force being ill or dying.

    The cooperatives also focused on analyzing the problem of limited income sources affecting the income of members. Since the establishment of these agricultural cooperatives, they have only focused on agricultural production, excessively concentrating manpower, materials, and financial resources on agricultural production and basic construction, and have not devoted appropriate resources to engaging in sideline production. Some sideline businesses have even been completely squeezed out. This is one of the important reasons for the reduction in income. According to the survey of Mazhi Cooperative, five types of sideline businesses have seen a decrease in operating volume since the establishment of the cooperative, and three types have been squeezed out completely. From January to May last year, the sideline income of Yangchang Cooperative was 7,202 yuan, but this year it was only 4,373 yuan, a decrease of 39.3%.

    The lack of planning in the use of labor, resulting in a serious waste of manpower and materials, is also an important reason for the reduced income of some members. For example, in the Mazhi Cooperative, construction began without selecting a good location for water conservancy projects, resulting in the three dug ponds being ineffective; the construction of a reservoir for power generation was blindly carried out, using more than 3,200 workdays, and was later forced to stop. These two projects wasted a total of 4,000 workdays. If these workdays were invested in sideline production such as lime burning, it could increase the cooperative's income by 3,200 yuan.

    After analysis and research in various aspects, the basic key to the cooperative's increase and decrease in production and the reasons for the income reduction of 414 households were clarified, which made the leaders of the agricultural cooperative clear-headed. On this basis, it is more confident to strive for increased income for the households with reduced income. After mobilizing members to discuss, find solutions, and think of ways, the six cooperatives decided to start from the following aspects to strive for increased income for more than 90% of the members:
      (1) Vigorously promote agricultural production to ensure the realization of the increased production plan. The cooperatives adopted various measures to increase production to tap the potential for increased production. The increased production targets were generally raised by about 5% compared to the original planned targets.
      (2) Develop diversified operations to increase the sideline income of the cooperative and member households. Xima Cooperative operates seven types of sideline businesses, such as coal mining, and has obtained a net profit of more than 2,558 yuan in twenty days. Mazhi Cooperative plans to buy 100 piglets and distribute them to members with weak labor forces who may see a reduction in income to raise. Lianhua Cooperative's Guankouzhai Production Team organized members to find wild rattan for feed, and Caijiayuan Production Team organized women to dig medicinal herbs. Xima Cooperative organized 20 households with reduced income due to weak labor force to cut pig feed for the cooperative. Ten of these twenty households could become income-increasing households, and ten could maintain their income. In addition, those with strong labor but a lot of land in the past were mobilized to work more; women members with good needlework skills were organized to do needlework; and elderly members were organized to collect manure or take care of children.
      (3) Implement the principle of running the cooperative diligently and frugally and saving expenses. For example, Lianhua Cooperative originally planned to spend 585 yuan on buying new plows and harrows, but now it organizes carpenters to repair the original old plows and harrows, saving this cash expenditure; it originally planned to buy 638 rawhide ropes, but now it mobilizes members to find wild rattan to replace them, saving 720 yuan; it originally planned to build three cattle pens, but later changed to renting members' ones, saving another 650 yuan. Plus savings in transportation expenses and other aspects, the total savings reached more than 3,000 yuan. After implementing the policy of running the cooperative diligently and frugally, Pingxi Cooperative saved 18,253 yuan in expenses, reducing the planned expenditure from 28% of the total income to 19%.
      (4) Use labor reasonably and reduce non-productive labor. Mazhi Cooperative originally planned to use 305 workdays to build a stone bridge, but now it is changed to a wooden pontoon bridge that only requires 10 workdays; by using the saved labor to fill in the abandoned old river course, more than 50 mu of fields can be added, increasing a part of the income; the original plan to expand the reservoir construction project is postponed to winter, and the labor force is organized to engage in sideline production, which can increase income by 11,000 yuan.

    After taking these measures, the income of the cooperatives has increased from various aspects, and the expenditure has been reduced from various aspects; therefore, the number of income-increasing households can rise to 92.58% of the total number of households in the six cooperatives, and the number of income-reducing households has dropped from the original 414 to 182, accounting for only 5.08% of the total number of households. The rest are households with maintained income. The cooperative with the most income-increasing households is Bajiang Cooperative, where income-increasing households account for 97.56% of the total number of households in the cooperative, and there are 10 income-reducing households, accounting for 2.44%. Although this cooperative has not yet achieved increased income for every household, if there are no major natural disasters in the future, then it is not a problem for more than 90% of the members to increase their income.

    Through the trial calculation of income distribution, not only the leading cadres of the agricultural cooperative are clear about the leadership production activities, and can take care of the overall situation, but also the members have figured out the details of production, realized the principle of more work, more gain, and know which aspects to work hard to strive for increased income.

    哪类户可能减少收入？怎样争取增加收入？
    贵州省龙里县麻芝、莲花、洗马、羊场、平西、巴江六个农业生产合作社都是高级社，共有社员三千五百九十二户。他们在7月间分别进行了全年分配试算。试算结果是：如能完成今年农、副业生产计划，则增加收入的户占87％，不增不减的占1.47％，减少收入的有四百一十四户，占11.53％。
    这些减收户可分这几种情况：
      （一）丧失劳动力的或人口多而劳动力弱的户，往年有部分土地出租的收入，今年完全按劳付酬，因而减收。这种户有一百七十八户，属鳏寡孤独的居多。
      （二）土地多劳动力弱，或劳动力虽强但仍赶不上部分土地出租时的收入，因而减收的有一百四十二户。这类户多半是富农或富裕中农。
    （三）新参加农业社生产的小商小贩，对农业生产不熟悉，虽然经常出工，但所得工分少，而过去副业收入较多，现在副业收入少了。这样减收的有五十一户。
      （四）其余的户都是遭受意外的灾祸而减少收入的，如主要劳动力患病、死亡等等。
    各社还着重分析了因收入来源不多而影响到社员收入的问题。这些农业社建立以后，只抓紧农业生产，把人力、物力、财力过分集中到农业生产和基本建设方面，没有抽出适当力量去从事副业生产，甚至有些副业完全被挤掉了，这是减少收入的重要原因之一。据麻芝社的调查，建社后经营额减少的副业有五种，被挤掉的有三种。羊场社去年元月至5月份，副业收入为七千二百零二元，今年只有四千三百七十三元，减少了39.3％。
    劳动力的使用缺乏计划，严重地浪费了人力和物力，也是部分社员减少收入的重要原因之一。如麻芝社在兴修水利当中，地址没有选好就动工，结果挖好的三口水塘不起作用；盲目修建发电用的水库，用了三千二百多个工，后来被迫停止。两项共浪费四千个工。如果把这批工作日投到烧石灰等副业生产上，就可以给社增加三千二百元的收入。
    经过了各方面的分析研究，弄清了合作社增产和减产的基本关键以及四百一十四户减收的原由，使农业社领导人员的头脑清醒了。在这个基础上，来争取减收户增加收入，就有底了。这六个社经过发动社员进行讨论、找窍门、想办法，决定从以下几个方面着手以争取90％以上的社员增加收入：
      （一）大力搞好农业生产，保证增产计划实现。各社采取各种增产办法来挖掘增产潜力。增产指标一般地比原计划指标提高5％左右。
      （二）开展多种经营，增加社和社员家庭的副业收入。洗马社经营挖煤等七种副业，在二十天内便得到纯利二千五百五十八元多。麻芝社计划买小猪一百头，分给劳动力弱可能减少收入的社员饲养。莲花社关口寨生产队组织社员找饲料野生藤，蔡家院生产队组织妇女挖药材。洗马社组织劳动力弱的二十户减收户给社里打猪草，二十户中有十户可变为增收户，十户保收户。另外，对劳动力强而过去土地多的减收户，动员他们多出工；对女社员针线手艺好的就组织她们做针线活；年纪老的社员就组织他们拣粪积肥或是看管小孩。
      （三）贯彻执行勤俭办社方针，节约开支。如莲花社原计划买新犁、新耙需开支五百八十五元，现在组织木工将原有旧的犁耙加以整修，便节约了这一笔现金开支；原计划买牛皮索子六百三十八条，现在发动社员找野生藤来代替，节约了七百二十元；原计划修三个牛圈，后改租用社员的，又节约了六百五十元，再加上运输开支等各方面的节约共达三千元以上。平西社贯彻了勤俭办社方针以后，开支节省了一万八千二百五十三元，将占总收入28％的开支计划，降到19％。
      （四）合理使用劳动力，减少非生产用工。麻芝社原计划用三百零五个工修一座石桥，现改为木便桥只要十个工；利用节省下来的劳力，填平荒废的老河道，增加五十多亩田，可增加一部分收入；将原计划水库扩建工程推迟到冬季作，组织劳动力从事副业生产，可增加收入一万一千元。
    采取这些措施以后，各社的收入从多方面得到增加，开支又从各方面予以减少；因此，增收户可以上升到占六个社总户数的92.58％，减收户由原来的四百十四户下降到一百八十二户，只占总户数的5.08％。其余都是保收户。增收户最多的是巴江社，增收户占全社总户数的97.56％，减收的有十户，占2.44％。这个社虽然目前还没有达到户户增收，如果今后没有特大自然灾害，那么90％以上的社员增加收入是不成问题的。
    通过收益分配试算工作，不但使农业合作社的领导干部在领导生产活动上心中有数，可以照顾全面，而且让社员们也摸到了生产的底细，体会到多劳多得的道理，知道了应从哪方面去努力来争取增加收入。
