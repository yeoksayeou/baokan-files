    "Navigation Light Double-Bulb Changer"
    (Reported by this newspaper) Cai Kangxian, a draftsman, and Yu Yikun, a driver, and other comrades of the Navigation Mark Team of the Nanjing Channel Engineering Area of the Yangtze River Administration Bureau, recently successfully developed a "Navigation Light Double-Bulb Changer," which ensures that the light buoys will not go out in the wind and waves, guaranteeing the safety of inland waterways.
    
    Currently, battery-powered light buoys in our country's inland waterways are prone to bulb burnout due to wind and wave turbulence. In the past, light buoys often went out because the bulbs burned out, causing accidents for ships navigating at night due to the loss of light buoy navigation. Now, with the "Navigation Light Double-Bulb Changer," ships will not run aground or collide due to bulb burnout.
    
    The "Navigation Light Double-Bulb Changer" is constructed with each bulb having its own circuit. A coil is used to make a magnet attract an iron piece, allowing the iron piece to conduct electricity to the bulb, causing it to light up. If this bulb burns out, the circuit is interrupted, the magnet's attraction disappears, and the iron piece returns to its original position, connecting the circuit to another bulb, allowing the other bulb to light up.
    
    The Nanjing Channel Engineering Area is now preparing to organize its promotion in various navigation mark sections of the Yangtze River.

### “航标灯双泡换泡器”

    “航标灯双泡换泡器”
    本报讯　长江航运管理局南京航道工程区航标组绘图员蔡康贤和司机俞义坤等同志最近试制成功一种“航标灯双泡换泡器”，使灯标在风浪里不会灭，内河航道安全有了保证。
    目前我国内河航道电池灯标，由于风浪颠簸，灯泡很易烧坏，过去常常因为灯泡烧坏灯标熄灭，使夜间航行船舶失去灯标导航而发生事故。现在有了“航标灯双泡换泡器”，就可以使船舶航行不致因灯泡烧坏熄灭发生搁浅碰撞事故。
    “航标灯双泡换泡器”的构造是每一灯泡有一电路，运用线圈使磁铁吸住一个铁片，使铁片与灯泡通电而发光，如果这一灯泡烧坏，电路中断后，磁铁吸力消失，铁片就回到原处与另一灯泡接通电路，另一灯泡就可发光。
    现在南京航道工程区正准备在长江各航标段组织推广。
