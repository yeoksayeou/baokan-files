    Soviet Boarding Schools
    On September 1st this year, the first batch of 285 Soviet boarding schools opened, with approximately 70,000 children aged seven to thirteen enrolled. These boarding schools, established according to the resolutions of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, represent a new and significant educational system. These schools aim to complete teaching tasks at a higher level, cultivating young citizens to become comprehensively developed builders of communism, both physically and intellectually, possessing a medium level of cultural and technical skills, and prepared for practical activities.
    Following the conclusion of the 20th Congress of the CPSU, tremendous preparations were made throughout the Soviet Union to establish these schools, with local economic and social institutions, and Party, Communist Youth League, and trade union organizations enthusiastically participating in the construction. Most of these schools are located in scenic suburban areas and healthy, wooded environments. Boarding schools are mostly multi-story buildings, featuring well-lit classrooms, spacious auditoriums, comfortable dormitories, beautiful living rooms, well-equipped dining halls, and fully equipped facilities for various extracurricular activities. The schools also have wood and metalworking workshops for teaching purposes, agricultural campuses, laboratories, and radio, automobile, and shipbuilding groups.
    These boarding schools only accept children voluntarily sent by their parents. Due to the initial stage of operation, it is not yet possible to widely admit children this year. Children of single mothers and mothers with many children, children of those disabled due to war or public service, orphans, and children whose parents are working in factories or institutions and whose families lack the conditions to care for them have priority for admission. This year's enrollment includes students from grades one to five. The school's teachers will have detailed conversations with the mother (or father, guardian) of each admitted child to understand each child's personality, what they like to play, whether they sleep soundly at night, their appetite, whether they can quickly get along with their classmates, and so on.
    The principals and teachers of the boarding schools are carefully selected outstanding educators with higher normal education. More importantly, they are people who love children and have a great interest and desire to teach in boarding schools. Before the start of the school year, principal training classes for boarding schools and joint training classes for teachers and Young Pioneer instructors were held in various places to better prepare for teaching.
    In addition to regular classes, boarding schools pay special attention to labor education, collectivism education, and the development of children's individuality. The forms of labor education are diverse. Practice factories and agricultural campuses are places to cultivate children's love for labor and train their practical skills. Girls are also organized into housekeeping groups to learn how to make pastries, delicious meals, and how to set the table beautifully. The education of children in collectivism is mainly undertaken by Young Pioneer instructors. The district committees of the Communist Youth League send the most active and capable instructors to boarding schools. Regarding the development of children's individuality, teachers at boarding schools will constantly pay attention to children's hobbies and specialties, and cultivate their interest in music, art, and so on.
    Students at boarding schools live at school regularly. Parents or guardians can voluntarily take their children home on Sundays and holidays or visit them at school. On designated days, boarding schools receive parents or guardians.
    Boarding schools maintain regular contact with parents or guardians and have parent-teacher conferences, the task of which is to assist the school's management in various ways, such as leading children on tours or excursions.
    There are very experienced childcare workers in boarding schools. At night, when the children are sleeping, the childcare workers visit each dormitory more than once to check whether the children are well covered and whether they are sleeping peacefully. In addition, they also help the children take baths, tidy up their clothes, and help the girls comb their braids. Children live in boarding schools as if they were living at home, even more comfortably and happily than at home.
    Boarding schools are fee-based, initially on a tiered system. The state fully covers the costs for children of parents with low wages or heavy family burdens and for orphans. Parents with higher wages must pay a certain amount of educational expenses for their children.
    The establishment of boarding schools has been welcomed by the broad masses of the Soviet people, who believe that this is a tremendous help from the state to families in raising children. Next year, more boarding schools will admit more children. Zhang Ye

    苏联的寄宿学校
    今年9月1日，苏联第一批二百八十五所寄宿学校开学了，约有七万多名七岁到十三岁的儿童入校学习。这些寄宿学校是根据苏联共产党第二十次代表大会的决议建立的，是一种具有重大意义的新的教育制度。这些学校用更高的水平来完成教学任务，培养年青的公民成为体力和智力得到全面发展的、具有中等文化技术水平的、对实际活动有准备的共产主义建设者。
    在苏共第二十次代表大会闭幕以后，苏联各地为建立这些学校进行了巨大的准备工作，各地经济和社会的机关，党、共青团和工会的组织都热烈地参加建校工作。这些学校大部分都设在风景优美的郊区和有益健康的树木繁茂的地方。寄宿学校大都是多层楼房，有光线充足的教室，宽敞的礼堂，舒适的宿舍，美观的客厅，设备完善的食堂和供各种课外活动用的设备齐全的场所。学校里还设有供教学用的木工、钳工实习工厂，农艺校园，试验室，无线电、汽车、造船等小组。
    这种寄宿学校只收家长自愿送去的孩子。因为初办，今年还不可能广泛地接收儿童入学。单身母亲和多子女母亲的子女、因战争和因公而残废的人的子女、孤儿和父母都在工厂或机关中工作家庭没有条件照管的子女都有优先入学的权利。今年招收的是由一年级到五年级的学生。学校的教师要同每一个被录取的儿童的母亲（或父亲、监护人）进行详细的谈话，以便了解每一个孩子的性格、喜欢玩什么、夜间睡觉安静不、饭量怎样、能不能很快地和同学们合得来，等等。
    寄宿学校的校长和教师都是经过严格挑选的受过高等师范教育的优秀教育工作者，而更主要的都是热爱儿童并且有极大的兴趣和志愿到寄宿学校来执教的人。在开学以前各地都开办了寄宿学校校长讲习班以及教师和少先队指导员的联合讲习班，为更好地进行教学做好准备工作。
    寄宿学校除了正课学习外，还特别注意劳动教育、集体主义教育和儿童的个性发展。劳动教育的形式是多种多样的，实习工厂、农艺校园等都是培养儿童热爱劳动和训练他们实际技能的场所，女孩子们还组织有家务小组，学习做点心、做美味的饭菜和怎样把餐桌摆得好看等。儿童的集体主义教育主要是由少先队的辅导员担任的，共青团的区委会都把最积极最能干的辅导员派到寄宿学校去。对于儿童的个性发展，寄宿学校的教师们将经常注意儿童的爱好和特长，培养他们对于音乐、美术……等等的兴趣。
    寄宿学校的学生经常住在学校里，家长或监护人可以在星期天和假日根据自愿把孩子接回家或是到学校去看孩子。在规定的日子里寄宿学校接待家长或监护人。
    寄宿学校和家长或监护人取得经常的联系，并且设有家长会议，它的任务是从各方面来帮助学校的管理机构，例如，有的时候领导儿童参观或是远足旅行等。
    寄宿学校里有很有经验的保育员，在夜间，孩子们睡觉的时候，保育员不止一次地到各个寝室去巡视，看孩子们的被子盖的好不好，睡的安静不安静，此外，还要帮助孩子们洗澡、整理服装和帮助女孩子梳辫子等。儿童们住在寄宿学校里就如同住在家里一样，甚至比住在家里还要舒服、快活。
    寄宿学校是收费的，最初是有等级的。工资不高或家庭负担较重的家长的孩子和孤儿的费用完全由国家负担，工资较高的家长要为孩子交纳一定数量的教养费。
    寄宿学校的设立受到苏联广大人民的欢迎，认为这是国家对家庭在教养子女方面的巨大帮助。明年将有更多的寄宿学校接收更多的儿童入学。　章叶
