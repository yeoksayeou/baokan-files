    On “Antagonism”
    Guan Feng
    (I)
    The recent discussion in the Ta Kung Pao on the nature of the contradictions between the working class and the national bourgeoisie in our country has aroused great interest among readers. Working cadres, in their study of philosophy, have engaged in heated debates on this issue with great enthusiasm. According to my understanding, there are three different opinions: One opinion is that the nature of the contradiction between the national bourgeoisie and the working class lies in exploitation and being exploited, and this relationship of exploitation and being exploited determines that the contradiction between them is antagonistic; therefore, this contradiction is antagonistic from beginning to end and cannot be transformed; the realization of the joint state-private ownership of all trades has only weakened the antagonism to some extent. Another opinion agrees with the above explanation of "antagonism," but believes that after the implementation of joint state-private ownership of all trades, the nature of the contradiction has been transformed into non-antagonistic. The third opinion is that "antagonism" is a form of contradictory struggle, the external antagonism or conflict between the two sides of the contradiction; therefore, it is determined that the contradiction between the working class and the national bourgeoisie in our country has been basically non-antagonistic throughout history, except for the ten-year civil war period, and can be resolved without developing into antagonism. If it can be affirmed that the antagonism of the contradiction lies in exploitation and being exploited, then there will be no dispute; if it can be affirmed that antagonism is the external antagonism or conflict between the two sides of the contradiction, then there will be no dispute. The most important thing here is: what exactly is the meaning of "antagonism" as a philosophical concept? If it is not clear what "antagonism" is, and each analyzes and debates based on their own understanding of "antagonism," the discussion will be difficult to deepen.
    Some people believe that we should proceed from objective facts, and that arguing about what "antagonism" is proceeds from concepts, and is therefore unnecessary. I think this view is wrong. What does it mean to proceed from concepts? This means regarding concepts as dead, unchanging, or a priori, and using them to fit objective facts. However, being guided by the Marxist-Leninist principle of the flexibility and objectivity of concepts, conducting scientific abstraction based on objective facts, and formulating and exploring the definition of concepts cannot be called proceeding from concepts. Marxist-Leninist epistemology tells us: thinking must create concepts based on objective facts, and then use concepts to make judgments and inferences. If concepts are confused, thinking cannot move forward even one step; if concepts are not scientific abstractions, but empty abstractions and arbitrary fabrications, then it will never be possible to reach correct conclusions. Therefore, I think it is absolutely necessary to explore what "antagonism" is.
    So, what is "antagonism"?
    (II)
    Marx and Engels did not delve deeply into "antagonism" as a philosophical concept. Because in their era, distinguishing between antagonistic and non-antagonistic contradictions in society had not become a theoretical issue that practice urgently demanded to be resolved; at that time, the most urgent task in their theoretical research was to clarify dialectical materialism from basic principles, and apply it to all aspects of history and real life, and to use dialectical materialism as a weapon to create scientific socialism and the theory of proletarian revolution. Marx and Engels often referred to class society as a society of class antagonism, and the relations of production based on private ownership of the means of production as antagonistic relations of production; however, we cannot consider this as a definition of the philosophical concept of "antagonism." At that time, "antagonism" had not acquired a specific philosophical meaning. When they used the concept of "antagonism" in the above-mentioned contexts, they were simply indicating that this contradiction would inevitably deepen and become so acute that it could only be overcome by violent means.
    Nevertheless, from the works of Marx and Engels, we can find some extremely important inspirations for exploring the concept of "antagonism." For example, Marx wrote in "The Poverty of Philosophy":
    "Is it to be wondered at that a society founded on the opposition of classes culminates in brutal contradiction, in the shock of body against body, as its final denouement?"
    "Only in an order of things in which there are no more classes or class antagonisms will social evolutions cease to be political revolutions. Till then, on the eve of every general reshuffling of society, the last word of social science will always be:
    ‘Combat or death: bloody struggle or annihilation. It is thus that the question is inexorably put.’" Here, Marx did not put forward the concepts of antagonism and non-antagonism; however, from this passage, it is not difficult for us to see the following points: (1) A society of class antagonism must lead to brutal contradictions, but it is not such a brutal contradiction from the beginning; (2) Brutal contradictions are the shock of body against body; (3) In social life, brutal contradictions are manifested as political revolutions, that is, extremely fierce struggles to overthrow the existing regime, and are often inseparable from bloody wars. If we think carefully about the principles of brutal contradictions indicated by Marx, we will gain great enlightenment and benefit in exploring what "antagonism" is.
    In the process of building socialism in the Soviet Union, distinguishing between antagonistic and non-antagonistic contradictions was brought to real life and became the most urgent theoretical problem. Lenin and Stalin scientifically solved this problem in principle in the struggle against "Left" and Right opportunists.
    In the Soviet Union during the transition period, there were two series of contradictions: one was the contradiction between the working class and the bourgeoisie; the other was the contradiction between workers and peasants (small farmers). The key to building socialism lies in overcoming these two contradictions. Therefore, distinguishing the nature of these two contradictions, and thus finding appropriate ways and methods to overcome the first and second contradictions, became the most urgent problem in real life.
    At that time, "Left" opportunists, the Trotskyites who later became traitors, theoretically and practically confused the above two contradictions. They said: After the bourgeois democratic revolution, the revolutionary nature of the peasants has been exhausted, and the working class will inevitably develop antagonism and conflict with the peasants. Therefore, they concluded that the working class should not consolidate the alliance with the peasants, but should break with the peasants, and should build socialism by making the peasants bankrupt. Obviously, this is a component of Trotsky's counter-revolutionary theory that denies that the socialist revolution can be victorious in one country.
    At that time, Right opportunists, the Bukharinites who later became traitors, also confused contradictions and antagonism, denied the existence of contradictions between workers and peasants, and included the rich peasants as a class among the peasants, thus believing that it was not to establish a worker-peasant alliance led by the working class and aimed at transforming small farmers with socialist principles, but to establish a casual alliance (including rich peasants), to have the working class abandon the cause of transforming the small-peasant economy, thus protecting the rich peasants and fostering the spontaneous forces of capitalism, and paving the way for the restoration of capitalism in the Soviet Union. Obviously, this is a component of Bukharin's philosophical mechanism and Right opportunism in the political line.
    However, the "Left" and Right factions had a common point in philosophy: they both confused contradictions and antagonism or conflict, saying that contradictions are antagonism, that is, conflict. Therefore, at that time, the Central Committee of the CPSU not only had to stand against them in the political line and crush their absurd line; but also had to stand against them in philosophy and crush their absurd philosophy. In the struggle against "Left" and Right opportunists, Lenin and Stalin creatively put forward the guiding principles and specific methods for resolving the contradictions between the working class and the bourgeoisie, and the contradictions between the working class and the peasants, and also studied the nature of these two contradictions, and the relationship between antagonism and contradiction.
    Lenin wrote: "Antagonism and contradiction are by no means one and the same. Under socialism, antagonism will disappear, but contradiction will remain." This was Lenin's commentary on Bukharin's "Economics of the Transition Period," directed at Bukharin's (and also Trotsky's) absurd philosophy of equating antagonism with contradiction.
    Stalin wrote in "Letter to Comrade Ch.": "The report says that our method of industrialization, that is, the socialist method of industrialization, 'does not impoverish the millions of masses, but improves their material living conditions, does not sharpen internal contradictions, but alleviates and resolves these contradictions.' It can be seen that here it refers to the combination of the working class and the basic masses of the working people, first of all, with the basic masses of the peasants. It can be seen that here it refers to the contradictions within the combination. With the growth of industrialization, that is, with the growth of the strength and influence of the proletariat in the country, these contradictions will be increasingly alleviated and smoothly resolved." "But you have forgotten all this, and talk about the contradiction between the proletariat and the rich peasants, that is, the contradiction outside the scope of the combination. Before we eliminate the rich peasant class, this contradiction will increase and sharpen."
    Obviously, the former contradiction is non-antagonistic, and the latter contradiction is antagonistic. But if you understand it this way: the antagonism of the latter lies only in exploitation and being exploited, the problem is oversimplified. It is clearly pointed out here: a non-antagonistic contradiction is a contradiction within the scope of the combination (that is, the union), and an antagonistic contradiction is a contradiction outside the scope of the combination; a non-antagonistic contradiction will be increasingly alleviated and smoothly resolved with the growth of the dominant aspect of the contradiction, and an antagonistic contradiction will increase and sharpen before the contradiction is resolved.
    The fact is also true: the working class and the peasants are in an alliance with the goal of building socialism, and this contradiction is being increasingly alleviated and resolved in the process of socialist industrialization and agricultural collectivization. At that time, in the Soviet Union, the working class and the bourgeoisie did not and could not have a united relationship, and the contradiction between the two classes was in external antagonism; before the bourgeoisie was eliminated, the class struggle was indeed becoming increasingly acute. It should be explained here that the 20th Congress of the CPSU criticized Stalin's theory of the increasing acuteness of the domestic class struggle, but its error lies in: in 1937, after the Soviet Union had built socialism and the exploiting classes had been eliminated, the theory of the increasing acuteness of the domestic class struggle was put forward, and this theory was used as the basis for expanding the anti-revolutionaries; and the statement that "the class struggle is becoming increasingly acute before the exploiting classes are eliminated" is not entirely wrong. In the Soviet Union at that time, the contradiction between the working class and the bourgeoisie was extremely antagonistic, and as long as the bourgeoisie existed as a class, the struggle between them could not but be increasingly acute. The fact is also true that in the process of eliminating the rich peasants on the basis of the overall collectivization of agriculture, the struggle with the rich peasants was more intense and acute than the period of restricting the rich peasants.
    Around 1934, some Soviet philosophers, based on Lenin's instructions and the practice of building socialism in the Soviet Union, gave the following definition of "antagonism": Antagonism is the intensification stage of contradiction, the state of direct conflict between opposing sides; all antagonism is a stage in the development of contradiction, and not all contradictions necessarily develop to the stage of antagonism. For example, the "Outline of New Philosophy" written by Mitin et al., the "Dialectical Materialism" written by Mitin, and the "Dialectical Materialism Tutorial" co-authored by Sirokov and Aisenberg, etc., are generally of this point of view. Although we don't have to think that this is a complete and profound definition of the philosophical concept of "antagonism"; however, when we explore what "antagonism" is, it is very necessary to consider this opinion. In the process of scientific development, it is not necessarily that all later opinions are more correct and profound than previous opinions.
    (III)
    Later, in the Soviet philosophical circles, the interpretation of the concept of "antagonism" tended to be more specific. The "Concise Philosophical Dictionary" can be regarded as a representative, and in the entry "Antagonistic Contradictions and Non-Antagonistic Contradictions" it wrote: "Antagonistic contradictions in society are those contradictions that are based on the irreconcilable interests between hostile classes, groups, and forces. This kind of contradiction can usually only be resolved by violent methods, that is, by revolutionary class struggle and the method of one class defeating another class, or by war, etc. For example, the contradiction existing between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat, whose fundamental interests are fundamentally opposed, is resolved through the socialist revolution." "The characteristics of antagonistic contradictions are: these contradictions will become increasingly acute and profound in their development, will turn into opposition, and the struggle between them will develop into sharp conflicts."
    I think it is correct to point out that hostile classes are the foundation of antagonism in social life; however, because this definition is too specific, it is too narrow:
    (1) This definition lacks philosophical generalization. Assuming that this definition is correct, then it can only be applied to social phenomena, but not to natural phenomena. It gives the impression that antagonistic contradictions do not seem to exist in nature. However, there is antagonism in nature, such as the explosion of bombs and the eruption of volcanoes, which are all antagonistic phenomena.
    (2) The statement of "violent methods, that is, the method of revolutionary class struggle and one class defeating another class" is inappropriate. This equates "violence" with "class struggle" and "one class defeating another class," excludes the diversity and complexity of class struggle, excludes the possibility of gradually eliminating the bourgeoisie by peaceful transformation under certain historical conditions, and seems to require the use of violence under any conditions.
    (3) It seems that "antagonism" is not a certain stage of development of a certain contradiction, but there is a kind of contradiction that is antagonistic from beginning to end; this excludes the mutual transformation of antagonism and non-antagonism under certain conditions. However, in reality, this transformation does exist, for example, the transformation of urban-rural contradictions from antagonism to non-antagonism, and the possibility of non-antagonistic contradictions within the party transforming into antagonism under certain conditions.
    (4) Stalin's argument that the struggle is becoming increasingly acute before the bourgeoisie is eliminated in the Soviet Union has been elevated to the definition of "antagonism"; however, it is not necessarily universal and absolute that antagonistic contradictions become increasingly acute in their development. For example, Marx once envisioned that under certain conditions, the working class could seize political power and nationalize the property of capitalists by means of redemption instead of confiscation. This may not be more acute than the struggle of the proletariat to seize political power from the bourgeoisie. Asserting that it is becoming increasingly acute excludes the possibility of antagonistic contradictions transforming into non-antagonistic ones under certain conditions.
    However, some comrades start from the above definition of "antagonism" and narrow it down even further. They only take the point of exploitation and being exploited as the characteristic and content of "antagonism," so it seems that the problem has been solved: the contradiction between the working class and the national bourgeoisie in our country is antagonistic, but due to historical conditions, a non-antagonistic method can be used to solve it. It is true that the national bourgeoisie exploits the working class (as long as it exists for a day, it will always exploit), this is a fact; it is also a fact that the contradiction between the working class and the national bourgeoisie in our country is resolved by peaceful transformation instead of antagonism. However, it is difficult to say that this theoretical analysis has any guiding significance for practice, and it is difficult to say that it has provided a deeper explanation of the facts. And upon closer examination, one cannot but discover many theoretical contradictions in this view: such as "using different methods to solve different contradictions" is a fundamental principle of Marxism, why can the antagonistic contradiction in our country be resolved by non-antagonistic methods? The answer is that this is due to the special historical conditions of our country; but don't the special historical conditions of our country affect the working class and the national bourgeoisie and the relationship between them that grow in this environment? Some people say: This is the working class giving play to its subjective initiative, which is naturally correct. But the exertion of this subjective initiative is based on objective laws, is "doing what is possible," not "doing what is impossible," and the exertion of the working class's initiative should also be included in the particularity of the contradiction between the working class and the national bourgeoisie, because the working class is one aspect of this contradiction, and is the main aspect, and "the nature of things is mainly determined by the main aspect of the contradiction that has gained a dominant position." ("On Contradiction")
    I think it is necessary to reconsider the meaning of the philosophical concept of "antagonism."
    (IV)
    In fact, Comrade Mao Zedong has scientifically clarified what "antagonism" is in "On Contradiction" from objective reality. Comrade Mao Zedong wrote in "On Contradiction":
    "The question of struggle in contradictions includes the question of what antagonism is. Our answer is: antagonism is one form of struggle between contradictions, but not all forms of struggle between contradictions.
    In human history, the antagonism of classes exists as a particular manifestation of the struggle between contradictions. The contradiction between the exploiting and exploited classes exists, whether in slave society, feudal society, or capitalist society. The two mutually contradictory classes coexist for a long time in one society, they struggle with each other, but it is only when the contradiction between the two classes has developed to a certain stage that the two sides take the form of external antagonism and develop into revolution. The transformation from peace to war in class society is also the same.
    When a bomb has not exploded, it is a time when contradictory things coexist in a unity due to certain conditions. It is only when new conditions (ignition) appear that an explosion occurs. All phenomena in nature where old contradictions are finally resolved by taking the form of external conflict to produce new things have similar situations." He also said:
    "Some contradictions are openly antagonistic, and some are not. According to the specific development of things, some contradictions develop from being originally non-antagonistic to being antagonistic; and some contradictions develop from being originally antagonistic to being non-antagonistic." From the above discussion, we can see the following points:
    (1) "Antagonism" is a special manifestation of the struggle of contradictions, a form of struggle of contradictions, that is, the form of external antagonism or conflict. This definition is applicable to both natural and social phenomena; and it distinguishes the antagonism and non-antagonism of contradictions from the particularity of what kind of relationship the two sides of the contradiction are in and what specific methods are taken to fight against each other. It can guide people to understand the essence of contradictions and guide people to take appropriate methods, adapt to the nature of objective things, and solve contradictions.
    (2) "Antagonism" is a product of the development of a certain contradiction to a certain stage. In society, the class opposition of one class exploiting another class is the basis of antagonism; but the contradiction between the exploiting class and the exploited class is not antagonistic from beginning to end, but becomes antagonistic when it develops to a certain stage. This argument is scientific and in line with the actual situation of social development.
    Naturally, the existence of the exploiting class always presupposes the exploitation of the working people. However, it is not under any conditions that this relationship of exploitation and being exploited will cause their antagonism and conflict. This is because the contradictions between various classes in society and national contradictions are very complex.
    For example, in the era of the Western bourgeois revolutions in the 17th and 18th centuries, overthrowing the rule of feudalism was the common interest of the bourgeoisie and the proletariat, and it was their greatest interest at that time. It was the demand for anti-feudalism that determined the movements of these two classes. Naturally, these two classes each had their own special class interests, and even at that time the bourgeoisie had the dual nature of revolutionary and compromising in opposing feudalism; precisely because of this, there were also fairly sharp contradictions in the anti-feudal revolution. However, after all, their common interests occupied a dominant position at that time; precisely because of this reason, the bourgeoisie and the working class in various Western countries once united to oppose feudal oppression. The contradiction between them, although it is the contradiction between the exploiter and the exploited, belongs to the contradiction within the united, not external antagonism. At that time, the greatest interest of the bourgeoisie was mainly not to increase the exploitation of workers and directly pursue maximum profits, but to remove the shackles of capitalist development—feudalism; the urgent demand of the working class was not to eliminate capitalism and the bourgeoisie, but to eliminate feudalism. The relationship between their interests, at that time, was not conducive to this, and must be detrimental to that. This is a historical fact. It is of no practical significance to call this contradiction within the scope of the united antagonism. If it is said that there were antagonistic factors between these two classes at that time, this is of course correct; however, after all, it was still latent, and had not yet developed into something that determined the fundamental nature of the contradiction and determined the open conflict between the two classes.
    The process of historical development is like this: when the bourgeoisie seized political power, its revolutionary nature ended, it compromised with the remaining feudal forces, and turned around to suppress the working class; the working class also moved the "gun" from its right shoulder to its left shoulder, and then the contradiction between these two classes became increasingly acute and transformed into an antagonistic contradiction. History has pushed the working class from the ally of the bourgeois revolution to the stage of struggling to overthrow the capitalist system and the bourgeois regime, which is a sign of this transformation. (Of course, the contradiction between the working class and the national bourgeoisie in our country is much more complicated than this situation, and has its own characteristics.)
    (3) The antagonism and non-antagonism of contradictions can transform into each other under certain conditions. This transformation is also the transformation of the two sides of the contradiction from taking this way to struggle against the other side to taking another way to struggle against the other side. In society, it is struggle in unity, or external conflict. This argument gives us a sharp weapon to analyze the characteristics of class struggle under certain conditions and at a certain stage; it is this analysis that is most important for deciding what specific ways and methods to take to conduct class struggle.
    Antagonism is a form of the struggle of contradictions, that is, taking the form of external antagonism or conflict. This is a scientific explanation of the philosophical concept of "antagonism." Comrade Mao Zedong's theory on the "position of antagonism in contradictions" is being proved by practice and has already been proved by practice.
    However, some people say: Comrade Mao Zedong's "antagonism" and "antagonistic contradiction" mentioned in "On Contradiction" are not the same concept; "antagonism" is a form of the struggle of contradictions, while "antagonistic contradiction" indicates the nature of the contradiction, and form and nature cannot be confused in any way.
    It should be said that this is a misunderstanding.
    What does the form of the struggle of contradictions mean? This is nothing more than saying what form or way the two sides of the contradiction take to struggle against each other. What determines the nature of the contradiction? Of course, it is determined by the contradiction itself, and should not be found outside the contradiction. The characteristics of the two sides of the contradiction, what kind of relationship the two sides are in, that is, how they are connected and struggle with each other, is the nature of the contradiction. Of course, external reasons will also affect the nature of the contradiction, and this influence is also to change the way the two sides of the contradiction are connected and struggle. The so-called "antagonism" and "non-antagonism" are used to distinguish their particularity from the way the two sides of the contradiction take (antagonistic or non-antagonistic) to struggle with each other. Of course, antagonism and non-antagonism cannot reveal all the particularity of the contradiction. Contradictions that are both antagonistic and contradictions that are both non-antagonistic also have their own characteristics; but this is a particularity in the struggle of contradictions. The contradictions take each other as the premise for their own existence, and they are in a state of unity and struggle, and unity is relative and struggle is absolute. This is the commonality and general nature of contradictions. If we leave the way the two sides of the contradiction take to connect and struggle with each other, and talk about the particularity of the contradiction, the antagonism and non-antagonism of the contradiction, then we cannot but become empty abstract arguments.
    Comrade Mao Zedong instructed us that to study the particularity of contradictions, we must understand the various aspects of the contradiction, "understand what specific positions each of their aspects occupies, what specific forms they use to have a relationship of mutual dependence and contradiction with each other, and what specific methods they use to struggle with each other in mutual dependence and contradiction, and after the rupture of dependence." Comrade Mao Zedong discussed the "position of antagonism in contradictions" after deeply studying the particularity of contradictions. This is not accidental, but has an internal logical relationship. External antagonism or conflict is precisely a special way of showing that the two sides of the contradiction are struggling with each other. The old always resists the new, and the new must overcome the resistance of the old to establish itself in life; in the current situation, what is important is what way the old takes to resist the new, and what way the new takes to overcome the resistance of the old. If the old is powerful, uncompromising, and is the dominant aspect of the contradiction, oppressing the new from "above," then the new must break through the oppression of the old from below and strive for its own survival. In this way, the struggle must be antagonistic. Although the old has been reduced to the secondary aspect of the contradiction, it still takes an uncompromising attitude and desperately resists the new, and it will inevitably continue to be antagonistic; under certain conditions, the old, which retreats to the secondary position of the contradiction, takes a compromising attitude towards the new, and can be transformed into a non-antagonistic contradiction, that is, the contradiction can be resolved in a more moderate way.
    (V)
    Now, we have three definitions of "antagonism" before us:
    The first definition includes both the class opposition relationship of exploitation and being exploited and the conflict between the two sides of the contradiction. In addition to the narrowness of this definition that cannot be applied to the natural world, it is also far behind objective reality. This definition presupposes that the exploiting class and the exploited class will develop to conflict under any era and any conditions, and must be resolved through violence. Obviously, this argument has been refuted by the fact that our country has peacefully transformed capitalism and bourgeois elements.
    The second definition abandons the meaning of conflict between the two sides of the contradiction, and antagonism is exploitation, and the relationship between the exploiting class and the exploited class is antagonistic from beginning to end. This view is theoretically untenable; it has no guiding significance for practice. Since we are talking about the nature of the contradiction, why can we abandon the major issue of whether the two sides of the contradiction are struggling, whether it is a conflict or not? If the philosophical concept of "antagonism" only indicates the relationship of exploitation, what is the significance? It is nothing more than giving the relationship of exploitation and being exploited a philosophical name. As long as the national bourgeoisie in our country exists as a class, it is of course exploiting the working class. Marxist scientific political economy has thoroughly explained this problem; giving it another name called "antagonism" will not deepen understanding, and will not reveal the characteristics of the struggle between these two classes at various historical stages and the forms of class struggle, so as to guide us to take appropriate ways to conduct class struggle.
    The third definition is: antagonism is the form of external antagonism or conflict of the struggle of contradictions; antagonism and non-antagonism can transform into each other under certain conditions. This is a scientific generalization of the nature of the contradiction from the characteristics of the two sides of the contradiction and how they depend on and struggle with each other, that is, from the basic content of the contradiction. It has great guiding significance for revolutionary practice. It can guide us to analyze the characteristics and specific forms of each stage of class struggle in historical development more deeply than whether there is a relationship of exploitation and being exploited between classes, so as to take appropriate ways and methods to conduct class struggle.
        ☆　☆　☆
    The above opinions may not be correct. However, I believe that it is very necessary to seriously and deeply explore this issue in the process of discussing whether the contradiction between the working class and the national bourgeoisie in our country is antagonistic or non-antagonistic. I suggest that we start a debate on the issue of "what is antagonism." As for the author's opinion on the issue of whether the contradiction between the working class and the national bourgeoisie in our country is antagonistic or non-antagonistic, it is certainly not something that this article can include; and after determining what antagonism is, it is still necessary to do hard and concrete research on the specific situation in our country. So, the author's opinion on this issue will have to wait until later.

    论“对抗”
    关锋
    （一）
    最近大公报对我国工人阶级和民族资产阶级矛盾性质问题展开的讨论，引起了广大读者的兴趣。在职干部在学习哲学中，很有兴味地在这个问题上展开了热烈争论。据我了解有三种不同的意见：一种意见是：民族资产阶级和工人阶级的矛盾性质，在于剥削和被剥削，这种剥削和被剥削的关系，决定了它们之间的矛盾具有对抗性；因而这种矛盾自始至终是对抗的，不能转变的；实现了全行业公私合营不过是对抗性有所削弱罢了。另一种意见，同意上述对于“对抗”的解释，但认为实行全行业公私合营以后，矛盾的性质已经转化成非对抗的了。第三种意见是：认为“对抗”是矛盾斗争的一种形式，是矛盾两方面的外部对抗或冲突；因而断定我国工人阶级和民族资产阶级的矛盾，在历史上除开十年内战一段时期外，基本上是非对抗的，并且可以不发展到对抗而获得解决。如果可以肯定矛盾的对抗性在于剥削和被剥削，那么，就没有什么争论了；如果可以肯定对抗是矛盾两方面的外部对抗或冲突，也就没有什么争论了。这里最重要的是，作为哲学概念的“对抗”，其含义究竟是什么？如果不弄清楚“对抗”是什么，各以自己对于“对抗”的理解进行分析和争辩，讨论则是难以深入的。
    有人认为应该从客观事实出发，争论什么是“对抗”则是从概念出发，因而是不必要的。我认为这种看法是不对的。什么是从概念出发？这就是把概念看作死的、不变的、或是先验的，用以去套客观事实。而以马克思列宁主义关于概念的灵活性、客观性原理作指导，根据客观事实进行科学抽象，去制定和探究概念的定义，是不能叫作从概念出发的。马克思列宁主义的认识论告诉我们：思维必须根据客观事实造成概念，然后运用概念进行判断、推理。如果概念混乱，思维便一步也不能前进；如果概念不是科学的抽象，而是空洞的抽象、任意的捏造，那么，无论如何也是不会得出正确结论来的。因此，我认为探讨一下“对抗”是什么，是完全必要的。
    那么，“对抗”是什么呢？
    （二）
    马克思、恩格斯并没有把“对抗”作为哲学概念来深入地探究。因为在他们的时代，区分社会中的对抗和非对抗的矛盾，并未成为实践所迫切要求解决的理论问题；当时他们理论研究上的最迫切的任务，是从基本原则上阐明辩证唯物主义，并把它运用到历史和现实生活的各方面去，是运用辩证唯物主义这个武器创立科学的社会主义和无产阶级革命的理论。马克思和恩格斯常常把阶级社会称为阶级对抗的社会，把私人占有生产资料的生产关系称为对抗的生产关系；然而我们却不可认为这是对于“对抗”这个哲学概念所下的定义。在那时，“对抗”并没有获得专门的哲学的意义。他们在上述场合使用“对抗”这个概念，无非是指明：这种矛盾不可避免地要加深并尖锐到极限，而且只有用暴力手段才能得到克服。
    虽然如此，但是从马克思和恩格斯的著作里，我们可以找到一些对探讨“对抗”这个概念的极重要的启示。例如马克思在“哲学的贫困”一书中写道：
     “一个在阶级对立上建筑起来的社会要走到残暴的矛盾上去，走到物体和物体底冲突上去，作为最后的解决，难道用得着惊奇吗？”
     “只有在一个既无阶级更无阶级对立的秩序里面，社会进化将不再变成政治革命。到那时为止，在社会底任何普遍的革新底前夜，社会科学底最后一句话始终是：
    ‘斗争或者死灭；流血的战争或者空无。问题就这样无情的摆着。’”这里，马克思并没有提出对抗和非对抗的概念；但是，从这段话中，我们不难看出以下几点：（一）阶级对立的社会一定要走到残暴的矛盾上去，而并非一开始就是这样的残暴的矛盾；（二）残暴的矛盾即物体和物体底冲突；（三）在社会生活中，残暴的矛盾表现为政治革命，即推翻现存政权的极其激烈的斗争，而且往往是和流血的战争分不开的。我们仔细思索一下，马克思所指示的关于残暴的矛盾的原理，对于我们探讨“对抗”是什么，是会获得重大的启示和教益的。
    苏联在建设社会主义的过程中，区分对抗和非对抗的矛盾，被提到现实生活中来，成为最迫切的理论问题。而列宁和斯大林就在和“左”、右倾机会主义者斗争中，从原则上科学地解决了这个问题。
    处在过渡时期的苏联，当时国内存在着两个系列的矛盾，其一是工人阶级和资产阶级的矛盾；其二是工人和农民（小农）的矛盾。要建成社会主义，就在于克服这两种矛盾。于是区分这两种矛盾的性质，从而找出恰当的克服第一种和第二种矛盾的不同途径和方法，就成为现实生活中最迫切的问题了。
    当时“左”倾机会主义者、后来成为叛徒的托洛斯基派，就在理论上和实践上混淆上述两种矛盾。他们说：在资产阶级性的民主革命之后，农民的革命性已经用完了，工人阶级势必和农民发展为对抗和冲突。因此得出结论说：工人阶级不应该去巩固和农民的联盟，而应该和农民决裂，应该用使农民破产的办法去建设社会主义。很显然，这是托洛斯基否认社会主义革命可以在一国胜利的反革命理论的一个组成部分。
    当时右倾机会主义者、后来成为叛徒的布哈林，同样把矛盾和对抗混为一谈，否认工农之间存在着矛盾，并把富农这个阶级包括在农民之中，因而认为不是建立以工人阶级为领导的，以社会主义原则去改造小农为目的的工农联盟，而是建立一种随便的（包括富农在内的）联盟，要工人阶级放弃改造小农经济的事业，从而保护富农，助长资本主义的自发势力，为资本主义在苏联复辟开辟道路。很显然，这是布哈林哲学上的机械论和政治路线上的右倾机会主义的一个组成部分。
    但是，“左”派和右派在哲学上却有共同点：他们都把矛盾和对抗或冲突混为一谈，说矛盾就是对抗，就是冲突。因此，当时苏共中央，不但必须从政治路线上和他们对立起来，并把他们的荒谬路线粉碎；而且必须和他们在哲学上对立起来，并把他们的荒谬哲学粉碎。列宁和斯大林在和“左”、右倾机会主义斗争中，创造性地提出了解决工人阶级和资产阶级矛盾、工人阶级和农民的矛盾的方针和具体方法，同时也研究了这两种矛盾的性质、对抗和矛盾的关系。
    列宁写道：“对抗和矛盾决不是同一个东西。在社会主义制度下，对抗将消失，矛盾还会存在。”这是列宁在对布哈林的“过渡期经济学”评注中，针对布哈林（同时也针对托洛斯基）把对抗和矛盾等同起来的荒谬哲学而发的。
    斯大林在“给契·同志的信”中写道：“报告中说，我们的工业化方法，即社会主义的工业化方法‘不是使千百万群众贫穷化，而是改善他们的物质生活状况，不是使内部矛盾尖锐化，而是缓和并解决这些矛盾’。可见这里说的是工人阶级和劳动人民基本群众首先是和基本农民群众的结合。可见这里说的是结合内部的矛盾。随着工业化的增长，即随着无产阶级在国内的力量和影响的增长，这种矛盾将日益缓和并顺利解决。”“可是你忘记了这一切，而谈论无产阶级和富农之间的矛盾，即结合范围以外的矛盾。在我们还没有消灭富农阶级以前，这种矛盾是会日益增长并尖锐化的。”
    很显然，这里所说的前一种矛盾是非对抗的，后一种矛盾是对抗的。但是如果这样了解：后者的对抗性只在于剥削和被剥削，就把问题过分简单化了。这里很明显地指出了：非对抗的矛盾是结合（亦即联合）范围以内的矛盾，对抗的矛盾是结合范围以外的矛盾；非对抗矛盾随着矛盾主导方面力量的增长，将日益缓和并顺利解决，对抗的矛盾，在矛盾解决以前将日益增长和尖锐化。
    事实也正是如此：工人阶级和农民处于以建设社会主义为目标的联盟中，这种矛盾是在社会主义工业化和农业合作化的过程中日益缓和并获得解决的。而当时苏联，工人阶级和资产阶级并没有也不可能有联合关系，这两个阶级的矛盾是处于外部对抗中；在资产阶级未消灭以前，阶级斗争也确实是日益尖锐化的。这里应该说明，苏共第二十次代表大会批判了斯大林的国内阶级斗争日益尖锐的理论的错误，但是其错误乃是在于：在1937年，苏联建成社会主义，剥削阶级已经消灭以后，提出国内阶级斗争日益尖锐化，并把这种理论作为肃反扩大化的根据；而“在剥削阶级消灭以前，阶级斗争日益尖锐化”的提法，并不是完全错误的。在苏联当时，工人阶级和资产阶级的矛盾是极其对抗的，只要资产阶级作为阶级存在，它们之间的斗争，也就不能不是日益尖锐的。事实也正是如此，在农业全盘集体化基础上消灭富农的过程中，和富农的斗争，是较之限制富农时期更加激烈和尖锐的。
    大概在1934年前后，苏联有些哲学家根据列宁的指示和苏联建设社会主义的实践，对“对抗”所下的定义，大致如下：对抗是矛盾的激化阶段，是对立面直接冲突状态；一切对抗都是矛盾的发展阶段，而一切矛盾不必都发展到对抗阶段。如米丁等著的“新哲学大纲”、米丁著的“辩证唯物论”、西洛可夫、爱森堡合著的“辩证唯物论教程”等书，大体都是这样的观点。虽然，我们不必认为这就是对于“对抗”这个哲学概念的完备而深刻的定义；但是，我们在探讨“对抗”是什么时，考虑一下这个意见则是非常必要的。科学发展过程中，未必是一切后来的意见都比先前的意见更正确、更深刻。
    （三）
    后来在苏联哲学界，对于“对抗”这一概念的解释，趋向于具体化。“简明哲学辞典”可以做为代表，在“对抗性矛盾和非对抗性矛盾”一条中写道：“社会中的对抗性矛盾，就是那些以敌对的阶级、集团、力量之间的不可调和的利益为基础的矛盾。这种矛盾通常只有用暴力的方法，即用革命的阶级斗争和一个阶级战胜另一阶级的方法，或是战争的方法等等，才能得到解决。例如，在基本利益根本对立的资产阶级和无产阶级之间存在着的矛盾，就是通过社会主义革命来解决的。”“对抗性矛盾的特征是：这些矛盾在其发展过程中会越来越尖锐，越来越深刻，会变成对立，它们之间的斗争会发展成尖锐的冲突。”
    我认为，指出敌对阶级是社会生活中对抗的基础，这是正确的；但是，因为这个定义过于具体化，也就过分狭隘了：
    （一）这个定义缺乏哲学的概括性。假定这个定义是正确的，那么也只能适用于社会现象，而不能适用于自然现象。给人的印象是，似乎在自然界并不存在对抗的矛盾。然而，在自然界却是有对抗的，例用炸弹的爆炸，火山的爆发，都是对抗的现象。
    （二）“暴力的方法，即用革命的阶级斗争和一个阶级战胜另一阶级的方法”的提法，是不妥当的。这样就把“暴力”和“阶级斗争”、“一个阶级战胜另一阶级”等同起来，排斥了阶级斗争的多样性和复杂性，排斥了在一定的历史条件下，用和平改造的方法逐步消灭资产阶级的可能性，似乎在任何条件下都必须使用暴力。
    （三）似乎“对抗”不是某种矛盾发展的一定阶段，而是有一种矛盾，自始至终都是对抗的；这就排斥了对抗与非对抗在一定条件下的相互转化。但是，在现实中这种转化却是有的，例如城乡矛盾由对抗向非对抗的转化，党内非对抗矛盾在一定条件下也存在着向对抗转化的可能性。
    （四）把斯大林关于在苏联资产阶级消灭以前斗争越来越尖锐的论点，提升到了“对抗”的定义中去；可是对抗矛盾在其发展过程中越来越尖锐，却未必是普遍的、绝对的。例如马克思曾经设想，在某种条件下，工人阶级掌握了政权，可以不用没收的办法，而用赎买的办法把资本家的财产收归国有。这就未必比无产阶级从资产阶级手里夺取政权的斗争，更加尖锐。断言越来越尖锐，就排斥了在一定条件下对抗矛盾向非对抗转化的可能性。
    但是，有些同志却是从上述对于“对抗”的定义出发，而把它更加狭隘化了。只从其中采取剥削与被剥削这一点作为“对抗”的特征和内容，于是似乎解决了问题：我国工人阶级和民族资产阶级的矛盾是对抗的，但由于历史条件的关系，可以采用非对抗的方法解决。不错，民族资产阶级剥削工人阶级（只要它存在一天，总是要剥削的），这是事实；不用对抗而用和平改造的方法解决我国工人阶级和民族资产阶级的矛盾，这也是事实。然而这种理论上的分析，很难说对于实践有什么指导意义，很难说对于事实有了什么更深刻的说明。而且细究一下，也不能不发现这种看法在理论上的许多矛盾：如“用不同的方法去解决不同的矛盾”是马克思主义的一个根本原则，为什么在我国对抗的矛盾能用非对抗的方法解决？回答说，这是由于我国的特殊历史条件；可是我国的特殊的历史条件难道不影响生长在这个环境中工人阶级和民族资产阶级及它们之间的关系么？有人说：这是工人阶级发挥主观能动性，这自然是对的。但这种主观能动性的发挥，却是根据客观规律，是“为可为”，而不是“为不可为”，而且工人阶级能动性的发挥，也应该包括在工人阶级和民族资产阶级这一矛盾的特殊性中去，因为工人阶级就是这个矛盾的一方面，并且是主要的一方面，而“事物的性质主要地是由取得支配地位的矛盾的主要方面所规定的。”（“矛盾论”）
    我看有必要重新考虑“对抗”这一哲学概念的含义。
    （四）
    其实，毛泽东同志在“矛盾论”中，已经从客观实际出发，科学地阐明了“对抗”是什么这个问题。毛泽东同志在“矛盾论”中写道：
     “在矛盾的斗争性的问题中，包含着对抗是什么的问题。我们回答道：对抗是矛盾斗争的一种形式，而不是矛盾斗争的一切形式。
    在人类历史中，存在着阶级的对抗，这是矛盾斗争的一种特殊的表现。剥削阶级和被剥削阶级之间的矛盾，无论在奴隶社会也好，封建社会也好，资本主义社会也好，互相矛盾着的两阶级，长期地并存于一个社会中，它们互相斗争着，但要待两阶级的矛盾发展到了一定的阶段的时候，双方才取外部对抗的形式，发展为革命。阶级社会中，由和平向战争的转化，也是如此。
    炸弹在未爆炸的时候，是矛盾物因一定条件共居于一个统一体中的时候，待至新的条件（发火）出现，才发生了爆炸。自然界中一切到了最后要采取外部冲突形式去解决旧矛盾产生新事物的现象，都有与此相仿佛的情形。”他又说：
     “有些矛盾具有公开的对抗性，有些矛盾则不是这样。根据事物的具体发展，有些矛盾是由原来还非对抗性的，而发展成为对抗性的；也有些矛盾则由原来是对抗性的，而发展成为非对抗性的。”从以上论述中，我们可以看出以下几点：
    （一）“对抗”是矛盾斗争的一种特殊表现，矛盾斗争的一种形式，即外部对抗或冲突的形式。这个定义对于自然现象和社会现象都是适用的；并且从矛盾双方处于何等关系中、各采取何种具体方式和对方作斗争的特殊性上，区分了矛盾的对抗和非对抗。它能引导人们去认识矛盾的本质，引导人们采取恰当的方法，适应客观事物的本性，去动手解决矛盾。
    （二）“对抗”是某种矛盾发展到一定阶段上的产物。在社会上一个阶级剥削另一个阶级的阶级对立，是对抗的基础；但是剥削阶级和被剥削阶级之间的矛盾，并非自始至终都是对抗的，而是发展到一定阶段才成为对抗。这个论断是科学的，是符合社会发展的实际情况的。
    自然，剥削阶级的存在，总是以剥削劳动者为前提的。然而，并非在任何条件下，这种剥削和被剥削的关系都会造成它们的对抗和冲突。这是因为社会上的各个阶级的矛盾以及民族矛盾非常复杂的缘故。
    例如，在十七、十八世纪西方资产阶级革命的时代，推翻封建主义的统治，就是资产阶级和无产阶级的共同利益，并且是它们当时的最大利益。正是反封建的要求，决定了这两个阶级的动向。自然，这两个阶级各有其特殊的阶级利益，并且就在当时资产阶级也具有反封建的革命性和妥协性这样的两重性；正因为这样，所以在反封建的革命中也存在着相当尖锐的矛盾。但是，毕竟当时它们的共同利益是占着主导地位的；正因为这个缘故，所以当时西方各国的资产阶级和工人阶级曾经联合起来一致去反对封建压迫。它们之间的矛盾，尽管是剥削者和被剥削者的矛盾，但究竟是属于联合者内部的矛盾，而不是外部对抗。在那时资产阶级的最大利益，主要的还不是加重对工人的剥削，直接追求最大利润，而在于扫除资本主义发展的桎梏——封建主义；工人阶级的迫切要求也还不是消灭资本主义和资产阶级，而是消灭封建主义。它们之间的利害关系，在当时并非有利于此，必损于彼。这是历史事实。我们把这种联合范围之内的矛盾叫作对抗，是没有什么实际意义的。如果说当时这两个阶级就存在着对抗的因素，这当然是对的；然而究竟那还是潜在的，还未发展成为决定矛盾的根本性质、决定两个阶级公开冲突的东西。
    历史发展的过程是这样：当资产阶级夺取了政权，它的革命性就结束了，它与封建残余势力妥协，回头来镇压工人阶级；工人阶级也就把“枪”从自己的右肩移到左肩，于是这两个阶级之间的矛盾就越来越尖锐，转化成对抗的矛盾了。历史把工人阶级从资产阶级革命的同盟军，推上为推翻资本主义制度和资产阶级政权而斗争的阶段，就是这种转变的标志。（当然，我国工人阶级和民族资产阶级的矛盾较这种情形要复杂得多，并且有它自己的特点。）
    （三）矛盾的对抗和非对抗，在一定条件下是可以互相转化的。这种转化，也就是矛盾双方从采取这种方式和对方作斗争到采取另一种方式和对方作斗争的转变。在社会中就是联合中的斗争，或是外部冲突。这种论点，给了我们分析阶级斗争在一定条件下和一定阶段上的特点以锐利武器；正是这种分析，对于决定采取何种具体方式和方法去进行阶级斗争，最为紧要。
    对抗是矛盾斗争的一种形式，即取外部对抗或冲突的形式，这是对于“对抗”这个哲学概念的科学解释。毛泽东同志关于“对抗在矛盾中的地位”的理论，正在为实践证明着，并且已经为实践证明了。
    但是，有人说：毛泽东同志在“矛盾论”中所说的“对抗”与“对抗性的矛盾”并非同一概念；“对抗”是矛盾斗争的一种形式，“对抗性的矛盾”却是表明矛盾的性质的，而形式和性质是无论如何不能混为一谈的。
    应该说，这是一种误解。
    矛盾斗争的形式，究竟是什么意思呢？这无非是说矛盾的双方各采取何种形式或方式和对方作斗争。而矛盾的性质是由什么决定的呢？当然，是由矛盾本身决定的，不应到矛盾的外部去找。矛盾双方的特点、矛盾双方处于何等关系中，即怎样相互联结又相互斗争，就是矛盾的性质。固然，外部原因也会影响矛盾的性质，而这种影响，也即是使矛盾双方相互联结和斗争的方式有所改变。而所谓“对抗”和“非对抗”就是从矛盾双方采取何种方式（对抗的还是是非对抗的）互相作斗争来区分其特殊性的。固然，对抗和非对抗并不能揭露矛盾的全部特殊性，同是对抗的矛盾、同是非对抗的矛盾，也还各有各的特点；但是这却是矛盾斗争中的一种特殊性。矛盾各以对方为自己存在的前提，它们处在又统一又斗争的状态中，而统一是相对的，斗争是绝对的。这是矛盾的共性、一般性质。如果离开矛盾双方采取何种方式互相联结和互相斗争，而来谈论矛盾的特殊性、矛盾的对抗性和非对抗性，那就不能不变成空洞的抽象的议论。
    毛泽东同志指示我们说：研究矛盾的特殊性，必须了解矛盾的各个方面，“了解它们每一方面各占何等特定的地位，各用何种具体形式和对方发生互相依存又互相矛盾的关系，在互相依存又互相矛盾中，以及依存破裂后，又各用何种具体方法和对方作斗争。”毛泽东同志正是在深入地研究了矛盾的特殊性之后来论述“对抗在矛盾中的地位”的。这不是偶然的而是有内在的逻辑关系的。外部对抗或冲突，正是表明矛盾双方互相作斗争的一种特殊方式。旧东西总是抵抗新东西的，新东西必须克服旧东西的抵抗才能在生活中确立起来；在当前场合，重要的是旧东西采取何种方式抵抗新东西，新东西采取何种方式克服旧东西的抵抗。如果旧东西是强有力的，是不妥协的，是矛盾的主导方面，从“上面”压迫新东西，那么新东西就必须从下面冲破旧东西的压迫，争取自己的生存地位。这样，其斗争必然是对抗的。旧东西虽已降为矛盾的次要方面，但它仍采取不妥协的态度，拚命反抗新东西，也就必然继续对抗；在某种条件下，退居矛盾次要地位的旧东西，对新东西采取妥协的态度，则可以转化为非对抗的矛盾，就是说，可以采取较缓和的方式解决矛盾。
    （五）
    现在摆在我们面前的，有三种关于“对抗”的定义：
    第一种定义，既包含了剥削和被剥削的阶级对立关系，又包含了矛盾双方的冲突。除去这种定义的狭隘性不能适用于自然界不论以外，也已经大大的落后于客观现实了。这种定义，预定了剥削阶级和被剥削阶级在任何时代，任何条件下都会发展到冲突，都必须通过暴力才能解决。很显然，这种论点已为我国和平改造资本主义和资产阶级分子的事实所驳倒了。
    第二种定义，舍去了矛盾双方的冲突这一含义，对抗就是剥削，剥削阶级和被剥削阶级之间的关系自始至终都是对抗的。这种观点，在理论上是不通的；对于实践也没有什么指导意义。既然谈的是矛盾的性质，为什么可以抛开矛盾双方的斗争，是冲突或不是冲突这样重大的问题呢？如果“对抗”这个哲学概念只是表明剥削关系，那有什么意义呢？无非是给剥削和被剥削的关系起上一个哲学的名字。我国民族资产阶级只要作为阶级存在，当然是剥削工人阶级的。马克思主义的科学的政治经济学已经透彻说明了这个问题；再给他起上一个名字叫做“对抗”，也并不能加深认识，并不能揭露这两个阶级在各个历史阶段上斗争的特点和阶级斗争的形式，以指导我们采取恰当的方式去进行阶级斗争。
    第三种定义是：对抗是矛盾斗争的外部对抗或冲突的形式；对抗和非对抗在一定条件下是可以相互转化的。这是从矛盾双方的特点和他们如何互相依存和斗争中，即从矛盾的基本内容对矛盾性质的科学概括。它对于革命实践有巨大的指导意义。它可以指导我们，比阶级之间是否具有剥削和被剥削的关系更深入一步地去分析阶级斗争在历史发展中每一阶段上的特点和具体形式，从而采取恰当的方式、方法去进行阶级斗争。

    上述意见，未必是正确的。但是，我相信在讨论我国工人阶级和民族资产阶级的矛盾是对抗还是非对抗的过程中，认真地深入地探讨一下这个问题，是非常必要的。我建议在“什么是对抗”这个问题上展开争辩。至于作者对我国工人阶级和民族资产阶级的矛盾是对抗的还是非对抗的这一问题的意见，当然不是这篇文章所能包括的；并且确定了什么是对抗，对我国的具体情况也还需要作艰苦的具体研究。那么，作者对这个问题的意见，只有等以后发表了。
