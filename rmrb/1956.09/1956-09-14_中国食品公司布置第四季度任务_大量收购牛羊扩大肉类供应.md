Xinhua News Agency, September 11th. Recently, the China Food Company convened a national supply conference to specifically study the procurement and supply of cattle, sheep, and live pigs. The meeting held that the current period is the peak season for cattle and sheep in pastoral areas to gain weight and be marketed, and it is necessary to carry out large-scale purchases and sales, large-scale outward transfers, and expansion of reserves. This year, in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region alone, cattle production increased by 15% compared to last year, and sheep production increased by 20%.

The meeting determined that the number of cattle and sheep to be purchased in various pastoral areas in the fourth quarter of this year will increase significantly compared to the same period last year. Among them, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the largest producer, will supply twice as many sheep to large and medium-sized cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai as in the same period last year, and cattle will increase by 42%. In addition, there are 310,000 sets of internal organ products being transferred outwards for the first time. The meeting required food companies in agricultural areas to strengthen the management of beef and mutton. It required all localities to store large quantities of live cattle and sheep, frozen beef and mutton, and raised stall-fed cattle and sheep as early as possible to prepare for the source of goods for next spring and summer.

Xinhua News Agency, Hailar, September 11th. On the Hulunbuir grassland in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, livestock fattening up for winter are becoming increasingly strong.

The Hulunbuir League pastoral area has a total of more than 1.4 million head of livestock. Except for a small number of livestock that have not been transferred due to poor autumn camp pastures, the majority of livestock entered the autumn pastures in early and mid-August. This year, the pastoral area has sufficient rainfall and abundant water and grass, and the livestock are gaining weight rapidly. Up to now, cattle and horses in Chen Barag Banner, New Barag Left Banner, and New Barag Right Banner generally have more than 80% of their fat cover, and sheep and camels have about 70% of their fat cover. In Solon Banner, which is close to the Greater Khingan Mountains, large and small livestock have generally gained more than 60% of their fat cover. According to the latest reports from the above four pastoral banners, if there are no special climate changes, grazing until the end of November will allow large livestock to gain more than 90% of their fat cover, and sheep can gain 80% of their fat cover.

    中国食品公司布置第四季度任务
    大量收购牛羊扩大肉类供应
    新华社11日讯最近中国食品公司召开了全国供应会议，专门研究牛羊和生猪的收购和供应工作。会议认为，目前在牧区正是牛羊长膘，上市旺季的时候，必须进行大收大卖、大量外调和扩大贮备工作。今年仅内蒙古自治区，牛比去年增产15％，绵羊增产20％。
    会议确定今年第四季度在各牧区收购的牛、羊数量比去年同期增长很多。其中产量最大的内蒙古自治区供应北京、天津、上海等大中城市的羊比去年同期增加一倍，牛增加42％，另外还有三十一万套第一次外调的内脏商品。会议要求农业区的食品公司加强牛羊肉的经营业务。要求各地尽早大量贮备活牛羊、冻牛羊和饲养槽牛、羊，提早为明春、夏准备货源。
    据新华社海拉尔11日电内蒙古自治区呼伦贝尔草原上抓秋膘的牲畜，正越来越肥壮。
    呼伦贝尔盟牧区共有一百四十多万头牲畜，除少数牲畜因为秋营地草场不好未转移外，其余大批牲畜在8月初旬和中旬就已先后进入秋季牧场。今年牧区雨水充足，水草丰美，牲畜上膘很快。到目前止，陈巴尔虎旗和新巴尔虎左旗、新巴尔虎右旗的牛、马，一般都有八成多的膘，羊、骆驼已经有七成上下的膘。靠近大兴安岭的索伦旗的大小牲畜，一般都抓到六成以上的膘。据最近上述四个牧业旗汇报估计，如果气候没有特殊变化，放牧到11月底止，大牲畜膘可以抓到九成以上，羊膘可以抓到八成。
