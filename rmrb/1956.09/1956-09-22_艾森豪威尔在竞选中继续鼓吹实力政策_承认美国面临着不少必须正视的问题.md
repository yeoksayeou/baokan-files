Xinhua News Agency, Washington, September 21st: U.S. President Eisenhower, in his first formal campaign speech on September 19th, said that the United States is facing a "serious crisis" over the Suez Canal issue.

When talking about how the United States would deal with this "crisis," Eisenhower revealed the true intentions of the United States. He said, "When we occasionally disagree with certain allies, we are simply being loyal to ourselves and to our common cause (of Western colonial nations—editor)." Then, he cited the United States' actions when facing the "serious crisis in Indochina" two years ago to compare them with the United States' actions in the current Suez "crisis."

Eisenhower also talked about some issues that the United States "must face squarely."

First, he cited the anti-colonial struggles of the people of Asia and Africa. He believes that the West must adopt appeasement tactics towards all nations in this region.

Eisenhower talked about the second issue, saying, "Today, we see the power of nuclear weapons has developed the horrors of past wars to a new, deadly level. This fact must guide all our actions. It makes disarmament essential to world life."

The third problem that Eisenhower believes the United States must face squarely is the increasing development of relations between the socialist camp countries and neutral countries, as well as the increasing political influence of communist parties in various countries. He said that this is a threat to the United States.

The fourth problem that Eisenhower cited is the economic competition with the Soviet Union. He said, "Today, we see the first major industrial power rising to challenge the West in the economic field. This country is the Soviet Union, which is capable of producing so much steel, possessing so much heavy machinery, natural resources, and technological capabilities."

In fact, Eisenhower did not propose any policies that could solve these problems that the United States "must face squarely." Although he boasted in his speech about the "peaceful" efforts of the Republican government for more than three years in power to win votes, his attitude towards disarmament exposed the true face of this government's fear of peace. Eisenhower openly opposed stopping nuclear weapons tests and stopping the arms race, calling them "regressive." He also said that stopping conscription is "impossible under current world conditions."

    艾森豪威尔在竞选中继续鼓吹实力政策
    承认美国面临着不少必须正视的问题
    据新华社21日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔9月19日在第一篇正式的竞选演说里说，在苏伊士运河问题上，美国正面临着一个“严重的危机”。
    艾森豪威尔在谈到美国将如何对付这种“危机”的时候，透露了美国的真正意图。他说：“在我们偶尔同某些盟国发生分歧的时候，我们只是既忠于我们自己，又忠于我们（西方殖民国家——编）共同的事业。”接着他举出两年前面临“印度支那的严重危机”的时候美国的作法，来和美国在目前苏伊士“危机”中的作法相比拟。
    艾森豪威尔还谈到了美国“必须正视”的一些问题。
    首先，他举出亚非人民反殖民主义斗争。他认为，西方必须对这个地区的所有民族采取拉拢手段。
    艾森豪威尔谈到第二个问题说，“今天，我们看到核子武器的力量使已往的战争恐怖发展到了一种新的、致命的程度。必须让这一事实指导我们的一切行为。它使得裁军成了世界生活中不可少的东西。”
    艾森豪威尔认为美国必须正视的第三个问题是他所说的社会主义阵营国家和中立国家间关系的日益发展以及各国共产党越来越增长的政治影响。他说这是对美国的威胁。
    艾森豪威尔举出的第四个问题是同苏联的经济竞争问题。他说：“今天，我们在经济领域中看到有第一个工业大国起来向西方挑战。这个国家就是能够生产那样多的钢、拥有那样多的重型机械、天然资源和技术能力的苏联。”
    事实上，艾森豪威尔并没有提出能够解决美国所“必须正视”的这些问题的政策。尽管他在演说里夸耀共和党政府当政三年多以来的“和平”努力以拉拢选票，但是他对裁军问题所采取的态度，暴露了这个政府害怕和平的真面目。艾森豪威尔公然反对停止核子武器试验和停止扩军，把它们说成是“倒退”。他还说，停止征兵“在目前的世界条件下是办不到的。”
