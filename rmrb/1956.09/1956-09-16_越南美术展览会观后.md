Having been away from Vietnam for over twenty years, I still retain some understanding of Vietnam and its art scene from my nearly two decades of residence there. This is why I am particularly excited by the achievements of the Vietnamese artists displayed in this Vietnamese art exhibition, and by the portrayal of Vietnamese people's lives in their works. Comparing the past and present, the exhibition shines brilliantly in my eyes.

As we all know, Vietnam endured a long history under the cruel rule of foreign powers. Especially during the years of French colonial rule, the Vietnamese people suffered inhumane oppression and exploitation in politics and economics, and their national culture was severely devastated. Therefore, Vietnamese art could not develop normally. It was not until after the August Revolution that Vietnamese art began to develop in the right direction. The Vietnamese artworks exhibited today illustrate the transformation and development of Vietnamese art before and after the August Revolution, and demonstrate that the significant achievements of Vietnamese art today were hard-won.

What impressed me most in this exhibition was that each Vietnamese artist has their own unique style, and the entire exhibition presents a distinct national character. This vibrant scene will greatly encourage the Chinese art scene, which is currently in the "Hundred Flowers Blooming" period. Our artists and art workers will gain valuable inspiration from this exhibition. At the same time, from these works of Vietnamese artists full of patriotic enthusiasm and humanitarian spirit, we feel that the thoughts and feelings of Vietnamese artists are closely related to the Vietnamese people and all peace-loving people in the world. Therefore, I firmly believe that these works are not only cherished by the Vietnamese people, but also welcomed by us Chinese people with the same feelings.

Among the exhibits, whether folk New Year paintings, oil paintings, lacquer paintings, or sculptures, all have a high level of artistic skill. Especially the Vietnamese folk art of lacquer painting, with its long history and tradition, particularly attracts the audience. These lacquer paintings not only have ingenious production techniques but also high artistic value. The painter Huang Wenjin's lacquer painting "The Massacre in Wei Chuan Village" depicts the situation on January 19, 1955, when American imperialism and the South Vietnamese authorities killed the peaceful residents of Wei Chuan Village who supported the unification of Vietnam through negotiation. The painter uses deep tones to depict the sorrowful crowd scattered around the graves of the victims. From the picture, we seem to hear people's solemn oaths: "We will never rest until we avenge this blood feud." In another lacquer painting, "Farmers Going to Participate in Struggle Meeting," painter Nguyen Si Ngoc clearly and powerfully expresses the farmers' determination and confidence in the struggle through vivid character images and strongly contrasting colors, encouraging people to move forward like a march. Phan Ke An's lacquer painting "Recalling an Evening in the Northwest Region" depicts the people's armed forces patrolling in the majestic Northwest mountainous area with its overlapping mountains, immediately reminding me of the ancient Vietnamese folk tale "The Mountain God and the Water Spirit" that I heard in my childhood. Are not the people patrolling on the mountain like the Mountain God in the myth (organizing and leading the people to resist the Water Spirit who makes waves and harms the people in order to plunder the wealth of the land-based residents)? However, this is no longer the "god" conjured up by the people's wishes in the past, but the real, outstanding children of the people themselves—the brave and resourceful people's armed forces cultivated by the Vietnamese Labor Party. It is by relying on these teams loyal to the motherland and the people that the fields of northern Vietnam have won today and become a land of gold, making the labor of Hongji coal miners feel pleasant, and bringing unprecedented freedom and happiness to the Miao and Dai people in the Northwest region.

Among the lacquer paintings, there are many other excellent works, such as Nguyen Duc Nong's "Spinning and Weaving," where the painter uses soft silver tones and graceful figures to lyrically depict the peaceful labor of Vietnamese women. Le Quoc Loc's "Today We Can See the Light" simply depicts the close relationship between cadres and poor farmers. Pham Van Don's "Water Bailing," full of earthy flavor, etc., are all works full of life and strong appeal. These show how much Vietnamese painters love their homeland, their people, and how much they cherish their excellent folk traditions! From the achievements of Vietnamese lacquer painting, I have this understanding: to improve the artistic level of folk art crafts, you must have cultivated artists doing it themselves. I think we should first learn well the correct attitude of Vietnamese artists towards folk art traditions, especially their spirit of practical action. It is not enough to only learn the production methods of lacquer painting.

In addition to lacquer paintings, the other types of works by Vietnamese artists also have extremely high artistic levels. In terms of oil paintings, such as Tran Van Can's "Cui Mei," Ye Mingzhu's "Forest in the Viet Bac Base Area," Nguyen Can's "The Enemy Burned Down My Hometown," etc., are all works with high skills. In terms of sculpture, Pham Xuan Thi's "A Piece of Soil from the South," Shuang Wen's "The Xiangtian Massacre," and Tran Van Lan's "Inserting Boundary Markers and Dividing Land," etc., are all exceptionally moving masterpieces. In other works such as watercolors, chalk paintings, ink paintings, woodcuts, and sketches, the outstanding artistic talents and broad creative paths of Vietnamese artists are also displayed.

I firmly believe that this exhibition will be a great success. (Attached picture)

    越南美术展览会观后
    黎冰鸿
    同越南阔别二十多年了。但是，在我侨居越南近二十年的时间里，对于越南和越南美术界的情况，多少有些了解，而且至今还留有深刻的印象。正因为如此，这次越南美术展览中所显示出来的越南美术家的成就和作品中所反映的越南人民的生活，使我特别感到兴奋。在今昔对比之下，展览会在我眼前闪耀着灿烂的光彩。
    我们都知道，越南过去一段漫长的历史，差不多都是在外族残酷的统治之下度过的，尤其是在法国殖民统治的年代里，越南各族人民更受尽了政治上、经济上种种惨无人道的压迫和剥削，民族文化也遭受到严重的摧残，因此越南美术不能正常向上发展。直到八月革命以后，越南的美术才开始有了正确的发展方向。今天展览在我们眼前的越南美术作品，可以说明越南美术在八月革命前后转变和发展的过程，也可以看到越南美术能获得今天这样巨大的成就是很不容易的。
    在这个展览会中，给我以特别深刻的印象的，是每一位越南美术家都有着自己独特的风格，而整个展览会的作品则呈现着鲜明的民族色彩。这种生气蓬勃的情景，对目前正处在“百花齐放”时期的中国美术界将会起很大的鼓舞作用，我们的美术家们和美术工作者们将会从这次展览会中获得可贵的启发。同时，从越南美术家们这些充满爱国热情和人道主义精神的作品中，我们感到越南美术家的思想、感情是同越南人民和所有世界上爱好和平的人们息息相关的。因此，我深信，这些作品不仅为越南人民所珍视，我们中国人民将以同样心情欢迎它们。
    在陈列品中，无论是民间年画、油画、磨漆画或是雕塑作品，都有着高度的艺术水平，尤其是具有悠久历史传统的越南民间美术磨漆画，特别吸引观众。这些磨漆画不仅有着巧妙的制作技术，而且具有很高的艺术价值。画家黄文锦的磨漆画“在维川乡的惨杀事件”，描写1955年1月19日，美帝国主义和南越当局杀害那些赞成用协商方式统一越南的维川乡和平居民的情况，画家用深沉的色调，刻划了散布在死难者坟堆周围、满怀悲愤的人群。从画面上仿佛听到人们庄严的誓词：“不报这血海深仇誓不甘休”。在另一幅“农民去参加斗争会”的磨漆画上，画家阮士玉通过生动的人物形象和强烈对比的色彩，明确有力地表达了农民斗争的决心和信心，像进行曲似的鼓舞人们向前迈进。潘继安的磨漆画“回忆西北区的一个黄昏”，描写在万山重叠、气势雄伟的西北山区中巡逻的人民武装队伍，使我立刻联想到童年时代听过的越南古老的民间传说“山神与水精”的故事，画面上，在山上巡逻的人们，不正像神话中的山神（组织、领导人民抵抗那为着掠夺陆上居民的财富而兴波作浪为害人民的水精）吗？不过，这已不是过去那样凭人民的愿望臆造出来的“神”，而是现实的、人民自己的优秀儿女——越南劳动党教养出来的、勇敢机智的人民武装队伍。正是依靠这些忠于祖国、忠于人民的队伍，赢得了今天越北的田野成为遍地黄金，使得鸿基煤矿工人的劳动感到愉快，给西北地区苗、傣族人民带来了有史以来从未曾有的自由幸福生活。
    在磨漆画中，还有许多优秀的作品，如阮德浓的“纺纱和织布”，画家以柔和的银色调子，优美的人物姿态，抒情地写出越南妇女的和平劳动。黎国禄的“今天可见到光明了”，质朴地描画出干部和贫农的亲密关系。范文敦的充满泥土气味的“戽水”等，都是富有生活气息的、感染力很强的作品。这些说明了越南画家是多么热爱自己的乡土、自己的人民，和多么珍视自己民间的优良传统啊！从越南磨漆画的成就上，我有这样一点体会，就是：要提高民间美术工艺品的艺术水平，非得有修养的美术家们亲自动手不可。我认为，我们应该首先很好地学习越南美术家们对待民间美术传统的正确态度，尤其是他们这种身体力行的实践精神，如果仅仅学习磨漆画的制作方法是不够的。
    除了磨漆画，越南美术家其它种类的作品，也同样有着极高的艺术水平。油画方面，如陈文谨的“翠妹”，叶明珠的“越北根据地的森林”，阮灿的“敌人烧毁了我的家乡”……等，都是有着高度技巧的作品。在雕塑方面范春诗的“南方的一把泥土”，双文的“响田惨案”和陈文兰的“插界标、分田地”……等，都是异常动人的力作。其它如水彩画、粉笔画、水墨画、木刻、素描等作品中，也都显示了越南美术家们卓越的艺术才能和广阔的创作道路。
    我深信，这次展览一定会获得巨大的成功。（附图片）
