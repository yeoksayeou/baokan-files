Boxwood carvings are produced in the Wenzhou and Yueqing areas of Zhejiang. The products are all round-carved figures, exclusively for appreciation.

Boxwood is tough, smooth, and fine-grained, making it suitable for carving, and its natural color resembles ivory.

In the past, boxwood carvings mainly depicted mythological figures such as the "Eight Immortals" and "Ji Gong," but now the range of subjects has been greatly expanded. There are works depicting historical stories or myths, as well as reflecting real life, such as Zhang Shizhou's "Li Bai and Gao Lishi," Wang Ducun's "Orange Harvest," Ye Runzhou's "Keeper," and the late famous artist Zhu Zichang's "Hide-and-Seek" and "Everyone's Happy," all of which express the characters' emotions and dynamics very well.

    黄杨木雕
    黄杨木雕在浙江的温州、乐清一带出产较多，产品都是圆雕人物，专供欣赏用。
    黄杨木的木质坚韧、光滑细洁，宜于刻作，它的自然色彩好像象牙。
    黄杨木雕过去都雕“八仙”、“济公”等神话人物，现在题材范围已大大扩大。有表现历史故事或神话传说的，也有反映现实生活的，如张始周的“李太白和高力士”、王笃纯的“桔子丰收”、叶润周的“饲养员”和已故著名艺人朱子常的“捉迷藏”、“皆大欢喜”等，对人物情绪、动态都表现得很好。　葛克俭　贺鸣声李太白和高力士（黄杨木雕）  张始周作
