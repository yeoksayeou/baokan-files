    Improve the Quality of Medicinal Materials
    Le Songsheng
    Not long ago, I bought a prescription, which included several herbs like "Sangjisheng" (Taxillus chinensis) and "Guang Chenpi" (Citrus reticulata peel). The quality of these herbs was very poor. According to the standards, "Sangjisheng" should use short branches of about an inch in length, but now they are using thin stems with leaves. "Guang Chenpi" should be dried goods with a deep purple outer skin and a white inside, but now they are using the peels from eating fruit, and the color and aroma are not as good as before. As far as I know, this situation is not an isolated phenomenon.
    Is it that there are no good quality medicinal materials now? I don't think so. The main reason is that the supply is large, and the medicinal materials companies and cooperatives are careless in their purchases, acquiring without selection, and supplying the market as is without sorting by grade, thus creating a situation where good and bad are mixed together.
    We know that medicine is used to treat diseases, unlike other items. If the quality is not good, it will directly affect people's lives, which is no trivial matter. Therefore, I earnestly hope that the medicinal materials purchasing departments will purchase by grade and implement the policy of high quality for high price. In terms of supply, state-owned Chinese medicine stores and joint state-private Chinese medicine stores should be treated equally. Old Chinese medicine stores have many commendable aspects in terms of business experience, and it is hoped that they can be absorbed and promoted.
    Treating illness and saving lives is a major matter. Medicinal materials companies should earnestly find ways to improve the quality of medicinal materials in the future. Chinese medicine stores should also carefully select raw materials, so that the quality of medicinal materials can be improved a step further, to better serve patients.

    提高药材质量
    乐松生
    不久前，我买了一剂药，其中有“桑寄生”、“广陈皮”等几味药，这些药的质量很次。按规矩，“桑寄生”应用寸许短枝，而现在却采用了带叶细梗；“广陈皮”，应当是外皮深紫，里面白色的干货，但是现在用的是吃水果时扒下的皮，颜色、气味都不如从前了。这种情况，据我所知，还不是个别的现象。
    是不是现在就没有质量好的药材呢？我想不是的。主要是因为供应量大，药材公司、合作社在收购上漫不经心，不加选择地收购，收进来以后没有按等次整理，就原封供应市场，因而造成鱼龙混杂的现象。
    我们知道，药是用以治病的，不同其他物品。如果质量不好，就会直接影响人的生命，非同儿戏。因此我恳切地希望药材收购部门，分等次选购，贯彻执行优质优价的政策。在供应方面，对于国营国药门市部和公私合营的国药店，应该一视同仁。旧国药店在业务经验方面，有许多地方是可取的，希望能够加以吸取和发扬。
    医病救人是件大事，药材公司今后要认真设法提高药材质量；国药店也应精选原料，使药材质量提高一步，更好地为患者服务。
