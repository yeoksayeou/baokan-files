I fully agree with Comrade Mao Zedong's opening speech, Comrade Liu Shaoqi's political report, Comrade Deng Xiaoping's report on revising the Party Constitution, and Comrade Zhou Enlai's report on the Second Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy. I believe that the Party's general line since the Seventh National Congress has been completely correct. The political line and political leadership, the organizational line and organizational leadership of the Party Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong have been correct and wise; it is precisely because of this wise and strong leadership that the complete victory of our people's democratic revolution and the basic victory of the socialist revolution have been guaranteed, and great achievements have been made in socialist construction.

Now I would like to express some opinions on the issue of the leadership system and leadership methods of the Party in industrial enterprises.

Regarding this issue, heated debates have taken place within the Party organizations in Hubei Province. The focus of the debate is: Are the principles of the Party's collective leadership and unified leadership applicable to industrial enterprises? Some comrades believe that the situation in industrial enterprises is special, and advocate implementing the "one-chief system," that is, major issues concerning enterprise management should be decided by the administrative head alone, and do not need to be submitted to the Party committee for discussion; even if the Party committee discusses and makes a decision, if the Party member factory director (or manager) disagrees, they can refuse to implement the decision passed by the majority of the Party committee members; in administrative management, all personnel are required to mechanically obey the factory director's orders; at the production meetings presided over by the factory director, no one is allowed to raise opinions different from the factory director, and criticism of the factory director from below is even less allowed; in order to ensure the implementation of this "one-chief system," one-sided emphasis is placed on "using the strongest cadres as factory directors" in the use of cadres. We believe that this view is wrong, that it is inconsistent with the principles that our Party has effectively implemented for many years, namely, the combination of collective leadership and individual responsibility, and that it is inconsistent with the fine traditions that our Party has developed in the long revolutionary struggle, namely, the style of the mass line.

The adverse consequences of unilaterally emphasizing the "one-chief system":
	Diminished the Party's leadership role,
	Fostered various undesirable tendencies.

In the second half of 1953, we in the leadership also once unilaterally emphasized the "one-chief system," and neglected the Party's collective leadership and unified leadership. Some industrial enterprises in the Hubei region, under the influence of this erroneous thinking, suffered considerable serious losses. The main adverse consequences of this error were: diminishing the Party's leadership role, weakening the Party's political and ideological work; some enterprise units actually turned the Party organization into an appendage of the enterprise management organs; the Party organization relaxed its supervision of Party members holding administrative leadership positions, fostering the development of some comrades' individualistic arrogance; restricting and suppressing the enthusiasm and creativity of the vast number of cadres and workers; and giving bureaucraticism and commandism a legitimate excuse to grow even further.

The state-owned Jiang'an Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory is an example of these enterprises that unilaterally emphasized the "one-chief system." In 1953, they implemented the Ministry of Railways' Order No. 301, learned from and creatively applied the advanced experience of fraternal factories, improved the planning and organization of production, and achieved relatively significant results. However, due to the one-sided emphasis on the "one-chief system," the factory director overestimated his individual role, underestimated the role of the Party's collective leadership and the role of the workers, not only emphasizing the "one-chief system" in administrative management, but also actually moving the "one-chief system" into the Party, replacing the Party committee's collective leadership with his individual dictatorial practice. At that time, the factory director, who was also the secretary of the Party committee, often did not participate in the Party committee meetings' discussions, and did not listen to the opinions of the Party committee members. When the discussion was over, he would make a "conclusion," which he considered to be the Party committee's decision. At that time, while the factory's output increased, there were serious problems of poor product quality and a large amount of overtime work. Some lower-level cadres raised opinions and criticisms, but the factory's leading comrades not only did not humbly accept them, but also reprimanded the critics. In daily production meetings, lower-level personnel were arbitrarily reprimanded and lower-level cadres were not allowed to state their reasons. In such an atmosphere, cadres' and workers' opinions did not have an adequate opportunity to be reflected, and the factory director's erroneous decisions could not be corrected in a timely manner. The resentment and depression among cadres and workers were very serious. On the surface, they obeyed the decisions of the "one chief," but in secret they discussed them endlessly. A small number of cadres and activists were even so angry that they shed tears. In such a situation, it was impossible to guarantee the unity of production command and the improvement of production efficiency. Therefore, in 1954 and the first half of 1955, the factory's production fell into a state of chaos again. After studying the resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party in the first half of 1955, discussing and implementing the Provincial Party Committee's "Resolution on Strengthening the Party's Leadership over Industrial Capital Construction and Industrial Production," examining the ideology and work style of leading cadres, and carrying out criticism and self-criticism, some efforts were made to strengthen the Party's collective leadership, and the factory's work improved again.

Similar to the Jiang'an Machine Factory, the tendency to unilaterally emphasize the "one-chief system" and neglect the Party's leadership role also occurred to varying degrees in other enterprises during the same period, and the adverse effects it brought were similar to the situation of the Jiang'an Machine Factory.

After implementing the system of collective leadership and individual responsibility:
	Production command was unified, and production efficiency was improved.

In response to the above situation, in accordance with the central government's consistent instructions on the principle of combining collective leadership and individual responsibility and the central government's instructions on strengthening the Party's leadership over enterprises, the Hubei Provincial Party Committee passed the "Resolution on Strengthening the Party's Leadership over Industrial Capital Construction and Industrial Production" at its February 1955 meeting, determined that Party organizations in industrial enterprises must implement collective leadership and unified leadership, criticized the error of unilaterally emphasizing the "one-chief system" while deviating from the Party committee's unified leadership, and at the same time, determined that under the Party committee's unified leadership, responsibilities should be divided, and the factory director responsibility system should be implemented in administrative management. Major issues in enterprises must be seriously discussed by the Party committee, and after a decision is made, the Party organization, administrative organization, trade union organization, and Communist Youth League organization should divide the work to implement it. The daily business of administrative management should be the responsibility of the administrative head, and the Party committee should not take on everything. More than a year of practical experience has proved that this is correct and the effect is good.

The main reason held by comrades who advocate the "one-chief system" is: the production command of modern industry requires a high degree of centralization and unity. If the Party committee's collective leadership and unified leadership are implemented, it will form a "one-size-fits-all" approach, which will not only hinder the unity of enterprise management, but also hinder the strengthening of the Party's political work.

The "one-size-fits-all" leadership method in which the Party committee takes on administrative affairs has also existed. We must overcome and prevent this leadership method. The Party committee must never relax political leadership and turn itself into an administrative affairs agency, and the leading comrades of the Party committee must never get bogged down in the sea of pragmatism. However, the Party committee must seriously conduct investigation and research work on various major issues in the enterprise, study the instructions, orders, and plans issued by the higher-level administrative leading organs, and must submit them to the meeting for discussion in a prepared manner; when the Party committee deems it necessary, it can and should make appropriate decisions, and then implement them among the masses through certain organizations and by taking appropriate measures. Every member of the Party committee, including the Party member factory director, must conscientiously obey and resolutely implement the decisions of the Party committee. Doing so not only does not hinder the concentration of enterprise management, but also greatly helps to unify production command and improve production efficiency.

To prove this, I will give the following three examples from many facts:

The first example is the state-owned Wuhan No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory. Since 1954, it has been equipped with a relatively strong Party committee secretary, and in practice has always adhered to the system of division of labor and responsibility under the unified leadership of the Party committee. Since then, the factory Party committee has not only not formed a "one-size-fits-all" leadership that takes on administrative affairs, but has also corrected some past shortcomings in which the division of labor was not clear. They have not only given play to the role of the factory director and management organs, but also given play to the role of the trade union and the Communist Youth League, and under the unified leadership of the Party committee, they have better organized the collaboration between the management organs and mass organizations. This not only does not hinder, but also powerfully guarantees the unity of production command and the improvement of production efficiency. Over the past few years, their completion of national plans has been relatively good. The improvement of the factory's management level and technical level has been relatively rapid, and the growth of skilled workers, technical cadres, management cadres, and political work cadres has also been greater and better.

The second example is the China South Construction First Engineering Company. The company (then known as the Third Engineering Office) once unilaterally emphasized and promoted the "one-chief system" in 1954. On the surface, it implemented unified production command, but in practice, because the administrative head did not pay attention to discussing matters with cadres and the masses, some decisions and orders were not in line with reality and could not be implemented; although some decisions and orders were generally feasible, cadres and the masses often clashed because they did not understand the overall situation and the intentions of the leaders. At that time, the Party committee's leadership core had not been formed, and the thinking among cadres was very inconsistent. Therefore, this enterprise, on the surface, implemented the "one-chief system," but in reality, it was "three dukes in one country" each going their own way. On the surface, it was unified, but in reality, it was very disunified. After they studied the resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party and implemented the Hubei Provincial Party Committee's "Resolution on Strengthening the Party's Leadership over Industrial Capital Construction and Industrial Production" in the first half of 1955, they corrected the tendency to neglect the Party's leadership role, strengthened the Party committee's cadres, gradually established the Party committee's collective leadership and unified leadership, enhanced the Party's unity, gave play to the collective wisdom of cadres, Party members, and workers, unified their thinking and steps, strengthened the Party's political and ideological work, and improved the consciousness of the workers, thereby more forcefully guaranteeing the centralized unity of production command and correcting the past chaotic phenomena of disorganization and lack of discipline. The company comprehensively and over-fulfilled the national plan in 1955, and the engineering plan for the first half of 1956 was also completed relatively well.

The third example is the Wuhan Yuhua Textile Factory. This is a joint state-private enterprise. When the capitalist was the manager, we relied on the Party's grassroots organization to lead the work of this factory. After the Party committee discussed and decided on major issues related to administrative management, we then consulted with the non-Party manager. Even at this time, the production level of the Yuhua Textile Factory was not lagging behind those factories that unilaterally emphasized the "one-chief system." Later, when our Party member became the manager, we did not weaken the Party committee's unified leadership, which did not hinder the manager and management organs from performing their functions. Especially since this year, the factory Party committee has emphasized the combination of collective leadership and individual responsibility, emphasized the work style of the mass line, and implemented the principle of "from the masses, to the masses" into political work, economic work, and technical work. The effect of doing so has been good. They comprehensively and over-fulfilled the production and financial plan for the first half of 1956, and can guarantee that the factory's five-year plan will be completed in four years. The factory Party committee realizes that helping administrative management personnel and technical personnel (including Party members and non-Party members) learn the working methods of the mass line is one of the Party's important tasks; and the main method to achieve this task is to lead cadres to learn in production practice. In this regard, they have already explored some specific experiences. I will only mention one thing: The problem of the frequent and large-scale backlog of yarn tubes in the yarn tube, yarn reeling, and finished yarn workshops has been a major key problem related to the factory's entire production for more than three years. In the past, it was always thought that the fundamental solution to the backlog of yarn tubes was to increase machines and personnel. Therefore, they successively added twenty yarn tube machines in two years, but the problem of the backlog of yarn tubes was not solved. After the output of cotton yarn increased in the first quarter of this year, the problem of the backlog of yarn tubes became even more serious. Although twenty-one workers were added to reduce the backlog of yarn tubes, the problem was still not completely solved. In February of this year, the factory Party committee comprehensively analyzed the production situation, believing that for the prominent weak link of the backlog of yarn tubes, it was necessary to adopt a method of leadership personally participating while relying on the masses to solve it. The factory's leadership personnel (including administrative and technical personnel) went deep into the worker masses in the yarn tube process, re-studied and summarized the operating experience of the young female worker Yuan Yugui, which had already been discovered in 1955 but had not been seriously summarized and promoted. Yuan Yugui's daily output was more than twenty catties higher than that of ordinary workers, and the quality of the joints was also good. In the summary, the operating advantages of other advanced producers were also absorbed, thereby summarizing a relatively complete set of yarn tube working methods. After this working method was promoted, in just over twenty days, the situation of the backlog of yarn tubes in the yarn tube process was completely reversed. Now, the yarn tube process not only does not need to add workers and equipment, but also transferred out sixty-one workers and saved four yarn tube machines. The factory's chief engineer said with great emotion: "This is an old problem that has existed for several years. We thought that it was impossible to solve it without increasing equipment and workers. We didn't expect that when the problem was brought to the masses, it would be solved quickly." The factory Party committee grasped this type of case to educate cadres, which was of great help to management personnel and technical personnel.

All these facts prove that in industrial enterprises, whether it is political work or economic work, we must adhere to the principle of combining the Party's collective leadership with individual responsibility, and combining the leadership backbone with the broad masses. Only in this way can we run the enterprise well.

All these facts prove that the central government's instructions on the leadership system of industrial enterprises are correct. As Comrade Shaoqi pointed out: "In enterprises, a leadership system combining collective leadership with individual responsibility with the Party as the core should be established. All major issues should be discussed collectively and decided jointly, and all daily work should be the responsibility of dedicated personnel. The leaders of enterprises, the Party organizations, administrative organizations, trade union organizations, and Communist Youth League organizations in enterprises should be good at explaining the current tasks of the enterprise clearly to the masses, be good at mobilizing the masses to carry out socialist competitions and advanced producer movements, put forward rationalization proposals, and constantly improve their work. The leadership backbone in all aspects of the enterprise should be good at going deep into the masses, integrating with the masses, understanding the sentiments and demands of the masses, and actively helping the masses solve their difficulties." We believe that this instruction is completely correct, and we will resolutely implement this instruction and strive to further improve the political and ideological work and business management of enterprises.

### 集体领导的原则是不是适用于工矿企业  王任重同志的发言

专栏：

    集体领导的原则是不是适用于工矿企业
    王任重同志的发言
    我完全同意毛泽东同志的开幕词、刘少奇同志的政治报告、邓小平同志关于修改党章的报告、周恩来同志关于发展国民经济第二个五年计划的报告。我认为从七大以来，党的总路线是完全正确的。以毛泽东同志为首的党中央委员会的政治路线和政治领导，组织路线和组织领导，都是正确而英明的；正是由于这种英明的强有力的领导，保证了我国人民民主革命的完全胜利和社会主义革命的基本胜利，并且取得了社会主义建设上的巨大成就。
    现在我就党在工业企业中的领导制度与领导方法问题发表一些意见。
    关于这个问题，在湖北省的党组织中，曾经发生过热烈的争论。争论的焦点是：党的集体领导和统一领导的原则是不是适用于工业企业？有一部分同志认为工业企业情况特殊，主张实行“一长制”，就是说关于企业管理方面的重大问题，都应当由行政首长个人决定，不必提交党委讨论；即使党委讨论了并且作出了决定，如果党员厂长（或经理）不同意，也可以不执行党委多数委员所通过的决定；在行政管理上要求一切人员机械地服从厂长的命令；在厂长主持的生产会议上，不准任何人提出和厂长不同的意见，更不允许下面批评厂长；为了保证这种“一长制”的贯彻执行，在干部使用方面就片面强调“以最强的干部当厂长”。我们认为这种主张是错误的，它同我党多年来行之有效的原则，即集体领导与个人负责相结合的原则是不相符合的，它同我党在长期革命斗争中锻炼出来的优良作风，即群众路线的作风是不相符合的。
    片面强调“一长制”的恶果：
      降低了党的领导作用，
      助长了各种不良倾向。
    在一九五三年下半年，我们领导上也曾经一度片面地强调了“一长制”，忽视了党的集体领导和统一领导。湖北地区有些工业企业，在这种错误思想的影响下，造成了相当严重的损失。这种错误的主要恶果是：降低了党的领导作用，削弱了党的政治思想工作；有些企业单位实际上把党组织变成了企业管理机关的附属品；党组织放松了对于担负行政领导工作的党员的监督，助长了某些同志的个人主义骄傲情绪的发展；束缚和压制了广大干部和职工群众的积极性和创造性；使官僚主义和命令主义得到了合法的借口而更加滋长起来。
    国营江岸机车车辆修理厂，就是这些片面强调“一长制”的企业当中的一个例子。一九五三年他们推行了铁道部三○一号命令，学习和创造性地运用了兄弟工厂的先进经验，改善了生产的计划工作和组织工作，取得了比较显著的成绩。但是由于片面强调“一长制”，该厂厂长过高地估计了个人的作用，看轻了党的集体领导和职工群众的作用，不但在行政管理上强调“一长制”，而且实际上把“一长制”搬到党内来了，以个人的独断专行代替了党委的集体领导。当时该厂厂长兼党委书记，常常不参加党委会议的讨论、不听取党委委员们的意见，等到讨论结束的时候，他来做个“结论”就当作党委的决定。当时，该厂在产量增加的同时已经发生了产品质量不好和大量加班加点的严重现象，有些下级干部提出意见和批评，该厂的领导同志不但不虚心接受，而且对批评者加以斥责。在日常生产会议上，对下级人员任意斥责并且不准下级干部诉说理由。在这样的气氛下，干部和群众的意见，没有适当反映的机会，厂长的错误决定也就不能得到及时的纠正。干部和群众中的埋怨和苦闷情绪很严重，表面上服从一长的决定，暗地里则议论纷纷，少数干部和积极分子甚至气得流泪。在这样的情形下，要想保证生产指挥的统一和生产效率的提高是不可能的。因此在一九五四年和一九五五年的上半年，该厂的生产又陷于混乱状态。经过一九五五年上半年学习党的七届四中全会决议，讨论和执行省委“关于加强党对工业基本建设与工业生产领导的决议”，检查了领导干部的思想和作风，开展了批评和自我批评，在加强党的集体领导方面，做了一些努力之后，该厂的工作才又有了好转。
    同江岸机厂相类似的片面强调“一长制”而忽视党的领导作用的倾向，在其他一些企业中，也在同一时期不同程度地发生过，它所带来的不良影响，也同江岸机厂的情况相类似。
    实行集体领导和个人负责制以后：
    生产指挥统一了，生产效率提高了。
    针对上述情况，根据中央历来所指示的集体领导与个人负责相结合的原则和中央有关加强党对企业领导的指示精神，湖北省委曾经在一九五五年二月会议上通过了“关于加强党对工业基本建设和工业生产领导的决议”，确定工业企业的党组织必须实行集体领导和统一领导，批判了脱离党委统一领导而片面强调“一长制”的错误，同时，确定在党委统一领导下分工负责，在行政管理上实行厂长负责制。企业中的重大问题必须交党委认真讨论，决定之后由党组织、行政组织、工会组织、青年团组织分工执行。行政管理上的日常业务，由行政首长负责，党委不应当包办代替。一年多的实践经验证明，这样做是正确的，效果是良好的。
    主张“一长制”的同志所持的主要理由是：现代工业的生产指挥需要高度的集中统一，如果实行党委的集体领导和统一领导，就会形成“一揽子”，既会妨碍企业管理的统一，又会妨碍党的政治工作的加强。
    党委包办行政事务的“一揽子”的领导方法，也是有过的，我们对于这种领导方法是要克服和防止的。党委决不可放松政治领导而把自己变成行政事务机关，党委的领导同志决不可把自己陷于事务主义的大海之中。但是，对于企业中的各项重大问题，党委必须认真地进行调查研究工作，学习上级行政领导机关颁发的指示、命令和计划，必须有准备地提交会议讨论；党委认为必要时，可以而且应当作出适当的决定，然后通过一定的组织，采取适当的措施到群众中去贯彻执行。党委的每一个成员，包括党员厂长在内，必须认真服从和坚决执行党委的决定。这样做，不但不妨碍企业管理上的集中，而且大大有助于生产指挥的统一和生产效率的提高。
    为了证明这一点，我从许多事实中举出下面三个例子：
    第一个例子是国营武汉第一棉纺织厂，该厂自从一九五四年以来，配备了较强的党委书记，在实际上是一直坚持着党委统一领导下的分工负责制。从这时起，该厂党委不但没有形成包揽行政事务的“一揽子”领导，而且纠正了过去某些分工不明确的毛病。他们既发挥了厂长和管理机关的作用，同时也发挥了工会、青年团的作用，并且在党委的统一领导下，较好地组织了管理机关和群众组织之间的协作。这样不但不妨碍，而且有力地保证了生产指挥的统一和生产效率的提高。几年来，他们完成国家计划的情况是比较好的。该厂的管理水平和技术水平的提高是比较快的，技术工人、技术干部、管理干部和政治工作干部的生长也是较多较好的。
    第二个例子是中南建筑第一工程公司。该公司在一九五四年（当时的名称是第三工程处）曾经一度片面强调和推行了“一长制”。表面上实行了统一的生产指挥，但在实际上，由于行政负责人不注意和干部、群众商量办事，因而有些决定和命令不符合实际，行不通；有些决定和命令虽然一般可行，但是干部和群众因为不了解全面情况和领导意图，也常常发生抵触。当时，党委的领导核心没有形成，干部之间的思想很不一致，因此，这个企业，在表面上是“一长制”，实际上是“一国三公”各行其是，表面上统一，实际上很不统一。他们在一九五五年上半年学习了党的七届四中全会的决议和贯彻执行了湖北省委“关于加强党对工业基本建设与工业生产领导的决议”以后，纠正了忽视党的领导作用的倾向，加强了党委的干部，逐步地建立了党委的集体领导和统一领导，增强了党的团结，发挥了干部、党员和职工群众的集体智慧，统一了思想和步调，加强了党的政治思想工作，提高了职工群众的觉悟，因而就比较有力地保证了生产指挥的集中统一，纠正了过去那种无组织、无纪律的混乱现象。这个公司在一九五五年全面、超额完成了国家计划，一九五六年上半年的工程计划也是完成得比较好的。
    第三个例子是武汉裕华纺织厂。这是一个公私合营的企业，在资本家当经理的时候，我们是依靠党的基层组织来领导这个工厂的工作的，有关行政管理方面的重大问题，党委讨论决定之后，再同非党的经理去协商，就在这个时候，裕华纺织厂的生产水平，并不比那些片面强调“一长制”的工厂落后。后来，我们的党员当了经理，也没有削弱党委的统一领导，这样并没有妨碍经理和管理机关职能的发挥。特别从今年以来，该厂党委强调了集体领导与个人负责相结合，强调了群众路线的工作作风，把“从群众中来，到群众中去”的原则，贯串到政治工作、经济工作和技术工作中去。这样做的效果是好的，他们全面地超额完成了一九五六年上半年的生产财务计划，并且能够保证该厂的五年计划四年完成。该厂党委认识到，帮助行政管理人员和技术人员（包括党员和非党员）学会群众路线的工作方法，是党的重要任务之一；而实现这个任务的主要方法是带领干部在生产实践中去学习。在这一方面，他们已经摸索到了一些具体经验。我现在只说一件事情：该厂筒子、摇纱、成纱车间，筒子工序经常大量积压管纱的问题，是一个存在了三年多的有关全厂生产的重大关键问题。过去总以为解决管纱积压的根本办法是增加机器和人员。因此他们在两年内陆续增加了二十台筒子机，但是管纱积压问题并没有解决。今年第一季度棉纱产量提高以后，管纱积压问题就更为严重。为了减少管纱积压，虽然增加了二十一个工人，仍然没有完全解决问题。今年二月份，该厂党委全面地分析了生产情况，认为对于管纱积压这一突出的薄弱环节，必须采取领导人员亲自动手而又依靠群众的方法来解决。该厂领导人员（包括行政和技术人员）深入到筒子工序的工人群众中去，重新研究和总结了在一九五五年就已经发现然而没有认真总结和推广的青年女工袁玉桂的操作经验，袁玉桂的日产量比一般工人高二十多斤，接头质量也好。在总结中，又吸收了其他先进生产者的操作优点，从而总结出一套较为完整的筒子工作法。这一工作法推广以后，不过二十余天，就完全扭转了筒子工序管纱积压的局面。现在，筒子工序不但不必再增加工人和设备，而且调出了工人六十一人，节余了筒子机四台。该厂总工程师很受感动地说：“这是一个几年来的老问题，我们认为不增加设备和工人，根本无法解决，想不到把问题一拿到群众中去，很快就解决了。”该厂党委抓住这样一类的事例去教育干部，对管理人员和技术人员的帮助是很大的。
    所有这些事实都证明：在工业企业中无论是政治工作或经济工作都必须坚持党的集体领导与个人负责相结合，领导骨干与广大群众相结合的原则，只有这样才能把企业办好。
    所有这些事实都证明：中央关于工业企业的领导制度问题的指示是正确的。正如少奇同志所指出的：“在企业中，应当建立以党为核心的集体领导和个人负责相结合的领导制度。凡是重大的问题都应当经过集体讨论和共同决定，凡是日常的工作都应当由专人分工负责。企业的领导者，企业中的党组织、行政组织、工会组织和青年团组织，都应当善于把企业的当前任务向群众解释清楚，善于发动群众开展社会主义竞赛和先进生产者运动，提出合理化建议，不断地改进工作。企业中各方面的领导骨干，都应当善于深入群众，同群众打成一片，了解群众的情绪和要求，积极帮助群众解决困难。”我们认为这个指示是完全正确的，我们坚决贯彻执行这个指示，为进一步改进企业的政治思想工作和经营管理工作而努力。
