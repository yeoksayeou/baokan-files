    The New School Year in the Soviet Union
    Worker-Students
    Among the 220,000 university students admitted to Soviet higher education institutions this year, many come from production units. They will bring their valuable production knowledge into the classroom, closely integrating theory with practice and enriching theory with practical experience. They will raise specific problems that exist in their work and demand solutions. This will not only bring Soviet schools closer to life but also solve practical problems for national construction. In the future, Soviet higher education institutions will continue to absorb people with production knowledge and life experience to study.
    New Institutions of Higher Learning in the East
    In order to cultivate a large number of scientific and technical personnel for the construction of Siberia and the Far East, the network of Soviet Eastern higher education institutions is expanding. The Krasnoyarsk Polytechnic Institute and the Yakutsk University, both newly established this year, have already begun enrollment. The Vladivostok University, which had been closed for a long time, has also been reopened. In addition, the existing school buildings in Irkutsk, Tomsk, Khabarovsk, and other places are being expanded to meet the urgent need.
    Special Groups for Children
    Starting this academic year, a new system will be implemented in the primary schools of the republic. Special groups will be organized for children in grades one to four. When their parents have not yet finished work, they can stay in school and study and rest under the guidance of teachers. At meal times, the students on duty will lead them to the dining hall and take care of them. After their parents get off work, the children will return home.

    苏联的新学年
    工人——大学生
    在苏联高等学校今年录取的二十二万大学生中，有不少是来自生产单位的。他们将把自己宝贵的生产知识带进课堂，使理论和实际密切结合，并用实际经验来丰富理论。他们将把在工作上存在的具体问题提出来，并要求解决。这样，不但使苏联的学校更进一步接近生活，并为国家建设解决实际问题。今后，苏联高等学校将不断吸收具有生产知识、生活经验的人们来学习。
    东方的新学府
    为了培养大批建设西伯利亚和远东的科学技术人材，苏联东方的高等学校网日益扩大。今年创办的克拉斯诺雅尔斯克工业大学和亚库斯克大学已经开始招生。停办已久的海参崴大学也已复校。此外，伊尔库茨克、托姆斯克、哈巴洛夫斯克等地正在扩建原有学校的校舍，以供迫切需要。
    孩子们的特殊组
    自本学年起，在共和国的小学校里将实行另一种新制度。为一至四年级的孩子们组织特殊组。当父母还未下班时，他们可以留在学校里，在教师的辅导下自习和休息。吃饭的时间，由值日生把他们领到饭厅，并照管他们。等父母下班后，孩子们再回到家去。
