The Unacceptable "Lineage Theory"
Zé Qún

Lu Xun ridiculed a group of "scholars" hiding on "Culture Mountain" in his short story "Taming the Waters." When one of them, Mr. Birdhead, an "archaeologist," was rendered speechless by the refutations of the "ignorant masses," another "scholar with a cane" angrily came to reprimand the "ignorant masses," and wanted to investigate the "ignorant masses'" genealogy, in order to prove that the "ignorant masses" were the result of "heredity." Unfortunately, the "ignorant masses" had no "genealogy," and the research of Mr. Birdhead and his ilk came to nothing, much to their disappointment.

This story was written in a bygone era, and is merely a 'tale' "taking a bit of cause and embellishing it at will." In today's world where the "ignorant masses" have turned the tables, characters like "Mr. Birdhead" and the "scholar with a cane" are nowhere to be seen; but for some comrades, this story still has practical educational significance.

As far as I know, three years ago, an old engineer proposed a suggestion to eliminate pinholes and shrinkage cavities in iron castings. The layers of reviewers were not interested in whether the suggestion itself was reasonable. Upon hearing that the engineer "grew up eating foreign bread and had also participated in the Kuomintang," they concluded that he could not possibly come up with any good suggestions. This suggestion was relegated to the back burner. But two years later, a Soviet expert went to the factory and made a suggestion to eliminate pinholes and shrinkage cavities in iron castings. It turned out to be the same as the old engineer had proposed in the past, and it was implemented with good results.

Here's another example. A young statistician who had just graduated from a vocational school got into an argument with a senior section chief over a statistical procedure. Although the statistician insisted on being reasonable, he was severely reprimanded by a third party: "You've only been working for a few days, and you're already showing such disrespect for your superiors!" "You need to thoroughly examine your bad thoughts and bad work style, and examine them in connection with the historical origins of your landlord family background!"

This "lineage theory" advocate's creed is: "Don't cut off history to examine a person's enthusiasm in isolation." He also self-taughtly cited the mathematical formula "zero multiplied by any number equals zero" as the basis for his judgment of people and things, as if anyone with a bad background or who had made mistakes in the past, that is, a bad "lineage," was like multiplying a "zero" factor into the multiplicative expression of that person's various qualities. All the good performance of this worker was not worth mentioning, and there was no question of cultivation, promotion, or Party membership.

This approach often makes people with bad backgrounds or who have made mistakes in the past timid and hesitant in their work, afraid of accidents. If an accident does happen, they become even more terrified and at a loss. In such a situation, how can they give play to their enthusiasm and creativity to serve the socialist cause?

There is no doubt that the historical situation of any worker should be thoroughly investigated, which is beneficial both publicly and privately, but after making it clear, they should be given sufficient trust and allowed to boldly gallop on the work front. If one simply judges a worker's merits based on "lineage," if one uses the "lineage theory" yardstick to restrict the enthusiasm and creativity of workers, that is a crime against the socialist cause and is unacceptable.

    要不得的“家谱论”
    泽群
    鲁迅在“理水”这篇小说中嘲笑了躲在“文化山”上的一群“学者”。其中一个叫做鸟头先生的“考古学家”被“愚民”驳得无话可说时，另一个“拿拄杖的学者”便愤愤然来申斥“愚民”，并且要查考“愚民”的家谱，借以证明“愚民”是“遗传”的结果；可惜“愚民”没有“家谱”，鸟头先生们的研究落了空，扫兴得很。
    这篇小说写于过去了的时代，而且仅是“取一点因由，随意点染”的‘故事’。在“愚民”翻了身的今天，“鸟头先生”和“拿拄杖的学者”一类的脚色是看不见了；可是对某些同志说来，这篇小说仍有实际的教育意义。
    据我所知，三年前一位老工程师提出一个消灭铸铁砂眼和缩孔的建议，层层的审查者对这项建议本身是否合理不感兴趣，一听到这位工程师是“吃洋面包长大，又参加过国民党”，就断定他提不出什么好建议。这份建议就被打入了冷宫。但两年后一位苏联专家到工厂去，提出消灭铸铁砂眼和缩孔的意见，竟然和老工程师过去所提过的一样，实行了，效果很好。
    再举一个例子。一个刚由专业学校毕业的青年统计员，为了一个统计程序问题，和老资格的科长争论起来。这个统计员虽然坚持得有理，但遭到第三者的严厉训斥：“你才参加工作几天，就这样目无领导！”“你这种坏思想、坏作风要好好检查，联系你地主家庭出身的历史根源来检查！”
    这位“家谱论”者的信条是：“不割断历史去孤立地考察一个人的积极性”。他又无师自通地引用了数学上“零乘任何数等于零”的公式作为他看人看事的根据，仿佛任何人只要出身不好或者过去犯过错误，也就是说“家谱”不好，就如同在这个人各方面条件的连乘式中乘入了一个“零”的因数，这个工作人员的一切好表现都不足挂齿了，谈不到培养、提拔、入党等问题了。
    这种作法，往往使得出身不好或者曾犯过错误的人在工作中畏首畏尾，束手束脚，害怕出事故，而万一出了事故，更加胆战心惊，不知如何是好。在这样的情况下，怎能发挥积极性、创造性为社会主义事业服务呢？
    毫无问题，任何工作人员的历史情况都应该弄得一清二楚，于公于私，都有好处，但弄清楚之后，就得给以足够的信任，让他们在工作战线上大胆地奔驰。如果仅仅根据“家谱”来简单地判定一个工作人员的好坏，如果用“家谱论”的铁尺来限制工作人员的积极性和创造性的发挥，那是对社会主义事业的犯罪，要不得的。
