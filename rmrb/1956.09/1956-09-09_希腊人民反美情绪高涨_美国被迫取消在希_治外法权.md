Xinhua News Agency, Athens, 8th: Under the pressure of the rising anti-American sentiment of the Greek people, the United States has been forced to reach an agreement with Greece stipulating the cancellation of the extraterritorial rights granted to American personnel in Greece under the treaty signed by the two countries in 1948. According to this agreement, American personnel in Greece will have the same legal status as in other member countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The agreement stipulates that Greek courts will try civil cases involving various American personnel, and in criminal cases, the Greek government will have so-called "priority of jurisdiction" only for those matters "directly related to it," while other cases will be submitted to U.S. military courts. This agreement does not apply to members of the U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group.

    希腊人民反美情绪高涨
    美国被迫取消在希“治外法权”
    新华社8日讯　雅典消息：在希腊人民反美情绪日益高涨的压力下，美国被迫同希腊达成了一项协议，规定取消根据两国在1948年签订的条约给予在希腊的美国人员的治外法权。根据这项协议，在希腊的美国人员将具有同在北大西洋公约组织其他成员国家一样的法律地位。协议规定，希腊法院将审判有关美国各种人员的民事案件，而在刑事案件上，希腊政府除了对那些和它“直接有关的事情”有所谓“优先审判权”外，其他案件则要提交美国军事法庭。这个协议不适用于美国军事援助顾问团的团员。
