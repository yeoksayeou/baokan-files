Title: A City Normally Abundant in Vegetables Also Lacks Vegetables

People who have been to Chengdu know that vegetables have always been abundant and cheap here. However, since this summer, the situation has changed, and there are not enough vegetables to eat. Every morning, especially on Sundays, housewives rush to the vegetable market in the middle of the night. Even so, some housewives still return with empty baskets or cannot find the vegetables they want to buy. Vegetable prices have also risen, doubling or tripling compared to last year. Citizens reflect: "We can afford rice, but we cannot afford vegetables."

The shortage and price increase of vegetables this year are certainly related to the continuous increase in the city's population. However, there are also significant problems in vegetable production and supply. First, agricultural cooperatives have focused on increasing grain production and have neglected the supply of vegetables to the city. Some agricultural production cooperatives, in order to produce more grain, have reduced the area planted with vegetables, and even converted mature vegetable plots to grow grain crops, greatly reducing vegetable production.

Secondly, in the past two years, some factories and schools have been newly built in the suburbs of Chengdu, occupying some specialized vegetable land (200 mu were occupied this year). After the specialized vegetable land was occupied, many old vegetable farmers felt that life was better and the treatment was better in factories and enterprises, and they were willing to change careers. The number of old vegetable farmers has decreased, while it takes three or four years for ordinary farmers to learn vegetable cultivation techniques.

Third, in the past, vegetables transported from various counties near Chengdu accounted for 25% to 30% of the daily market supply. Since the beginning of this year, because the vegetable fields in the nearby counties have decreased and they themselves need more vegetables, the supply of vegetables to Chengdu has been decreasing day by day. In July, it dropped to about 15%. In addition, the number of short-distance vegetable vendors has decreased compared to the past. Therefore, the vegetables transported to Chengdu from various counties have gradually decreased.

There is also an artificial sense of tension in vegetable prices. In order to manage the supply of vegetables, the Chengdu commercial department established a vegetable company this year. This increased the size of the organization and personnel, increased circulation links, and increased the cost of vegetables. Later, although the vegetable company was abolished, the city trade company did not promptly take over the non-staple food supply business, the market management was chaotic, and prices fluctuated.

Now, the city trade company has actively sent people to various counties to purchase vegetables, increase the supply of bean products and dried vegetables, and the shortage of vegetables has slightly improved. At the same time, the city agricultural department also plans to establish five vegetable zones within two or three years, open up 10,000 mu of new vegetable land, restrict the occupation of vegetable land by basic construction, and promote the advanced experience of "staggered sowing and harvesting in stages" to prevent uneven production in the off-season and peak seasons.

    一向多菜的城市也缺菜
    李策
    来过成都市的人们都知道这里一向菜多，价钱便宜。但是，今年夏季以来，情况变了，菜不够吃了。每天早晨，特别是星期天，家庭主妇们深更半夜就赶到菜市场上。就是这样，有些主妇们还是提着空菜篮子回来，或者找不到自己要买的菜。蔬菜也涨价了，比去年涨一倍到两倍。市民们反映：“饭吃得起，青菜吃不起”。
    今年蔬菜短少，涨价，当然同全市人口不断增加，是有关系的。但是蔬菜的生产和供应方面也有很大的问题，首先是农业社注意了提高粮食的生产，忽略了对城市蔬菜的供应。有些农业生产合作社为了多打粮食，减少了蔬菜种植面积，甚至把熟菜地改种粮食作物，使蔬菜生产大为减少。
    其次，这两年，成都市郊新建了些工厂、学校，占用了部分专业菜地（今年被占用了两百亩）。专业菜地被占用后，许多老菜农觉得工厂企业生活好，待遇好，愿意转业。老菜农减少了，而一般农民学会种菜技术却不是三、四年的事情。
    第三，过去成都市附近各县运来的蔬菜，每天占上市量的25％到30％。今年以来，因为附近各县菜地减少了，它们自己需要的菜也多了，供应成都的蔬菜便一天天下降。七月份，降到15％左右。加上短途蔬菜商贩比过去减少了。因此，成都市从各县运来的蔬菜便逐渐下降。
    在蔬菜价格上，也有人为的紧张现象。成都市商业部门为了把菜的供应管起来，今年成立了蔬菜公司。于是加大了机构和人员的编制，增加了流通环节，加高了蔬菜成本。后来虽撤销了蔬菜公司，但市贸易公司没有及时接替副食品供应业务，市场管理混乱，价格便发生波动。
    现在，市贸易公司已积极派人到各县采购蔬菜，增加豆制品和干菜的供应，蔬菜不够的情况略有好转。同时，市农业部门也拟定在三两年内，建立五个蔬菜区，新开辟菜地一万亩；限制基本建设占用菜地；推广“排开播种，分期收获”的先进经验，防止淡、旺季节生产不均衡。
