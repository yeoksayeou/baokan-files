Xinhua News Agency Report: China's first relic site museum began construction on the 2nd in the suburbs of Xi'an, at the site of the four-thousand-year-old Yangshao Culture village. It is expected to be completed by the end of this year and open to the public next spring.

    This museum covers an area of ​​more than 40,000 square meters. A large house of more than 2,000 square meters will be built on this site to preserve the more than ten house ruins that have been excavated. At the same time, more than ten square or round glass covers will be made to cover them to prevent wind and rain erosion.

    For the earth platforms, broken walls, and pillar holes in the house ruins, they will be hardened to the same hardness as glass using a special medicine based on the Soviet loess silicification method for long-term preservation. Various large artifacts that have been excavated from this site, such as pottery cooking utensils, water-drawing vessels, pottery basins, pottery jars, and pottery bowls for holding food, as well as red pottery jars used to bury children, will be placed in this large house according to their original locations.

    Two new exhibition rooms will be built next to the newly built large house to display many small items excavated from the site, including tools and decorations.

    This site is located in Banpo Village on the east bank of the Chan River near Xi'an. It was discovered in 1953, and the first excavation was carried out in the autumn of 1954 by staff from the Institute of Archaeology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The area excavated so far is less than half of the total area of ​​the site, and the remaining part is still being excavated. Xia Nai, deputy director of the Institute of Archaeology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said that this Yangshao Culture village site is the largest and best-preserved site discovered in China, providing rich materials for the study of the Neolithic Age.

    我国第一所遗址博物馆在西安兴建
    新华社讯　中国第一座遗址博物馆2日在西安市郊距离现在四千多年仰韶文化村落遗址上动工兴建，预计可以在今年年底竣工，明年春天开放。
    这座博物馆共占地四万多平方公尺，其中在这处遗址上要建立一个两千多平方公尺的大房子保存已经发掘的十多个房屋遗址，同时还要分别制成十多个方形或圆形的玻璃罩把它们罩起来，以防止风雨侵蚀。
    对房屋遗迹中的土台、断墙、柱洞等，将要根据苏联黄土矽化的方法，用一种特制的药物把它们硬化成和玻璃的硬度一样，以便长久保存。在这个遗址中已经发掘出来的各种大件遗物，如陶制的炊器、汲水器皿、盛食物用的陶盆、陶罐、陶碗和埋葬小孩用的红陶制成的陶罐以及石臼等，都将按照原来的位置放在这间大房子里。
    在新盖的大房子旁边将新建两座陈列室，陈列遗址中发掘出的许多小件物品，其中有工具装饰等。
    这个遗址位在西安市附近滻河东岸的半坡村，它是在1953年发现的，1954年秋由中国科学院考古研究所的工作人员进行了第一次发掘。目前已经发掘的面积还不到遗址总面积的一半，其余部分正继续发掘。中国科学院考古研究所副所长夏鼐说，这座仰韶文化的村落遗址是中国发现规模最大、保存最完整的遗址，它给研究新石器时代情况，提供了丰富的材料。
