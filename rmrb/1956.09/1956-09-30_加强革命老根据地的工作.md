Comrade Yang Shangkun, First Secretary of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Speaks:

    The Jiangxi delegation fully agrees with the reports of Comrades Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, and Deng Xiaoping.
    Over the past seven years, under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, Jiangxi's work has been successful. We have resolutely implemented the Party's policies, completed the work tasks of each period, basically achieved the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce, and achieved significant growth in industrial and agricultural production, and the lives of the people have been significantly improved. However, there are also many shortcomings and mistakes in our work. I would like to express some opinions on the issue of strengthening the work in the old base areas.
    Jiangxi has a total of eighty-two counties, and the old base areas account for more than two-thirds of the province's area. The province has a population of 17 million, and the population of the old base areas accounts for more than half of the province's total. Therefore, further mobilizing the enthusiasm of the people in the old base areas is a crucial key to mobilizing the enthusiasm of the people throughout the province.
    Under the leadership of our Party, the people in the old base areas of Jiangxi have waged a long and arduous struggle, especially during the Second Revolutionary Civil War. Under the direct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, they made significant contributions to the revolutionary cause and paid a great price. During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, hundreds of thousands of people were massacred, the province's population decreased by a quarter, countless villages were destroyed, and fields were left barren. However, the revolutionary will of the people in the old base areas is strong. After the Red Army marched north to resist Japan, they never stopped fighting the enemy. After liberation, they actively participated in various tasks and established a flesh-and-blood relationship with the Party.
    Since liberation, Party organizations at all levels in Jiangxi have attached importance to the work in the old base areas. Through supporting production, providing preferential treatment and relief, reducing and exempting burdens, absorbing and training some veteran cadres to participate in work, resolving the party membership issues of some veteran cadres, redressing the cases of party members and masses who were falsely accused during the period of the Third "Left" leaning opportunist line, and other series of works, the enthusiasm of the people in the old base areas has been enhanced, and the connection between the Party and the people in the old base areas has been greatly strengthened.
    We believe that in the future, to more comprehensively strengthen the work in the old base areas and further mobilize the enthusiasm of the people in the old base areas to build socialism, we should mainly grasp the following key links:
    First, the issue of developing the economy and improving people's lives.
    After several years of work, the economy of the old base areas, except for a few remote mountainous areas, has been fully restored and surpassed the highest level before the war. However, due to the shortage of labor (the proportion of families of revolutionary martyrs, soldiers, and cadres is large, and there are many widowers, widows, and orphans), the disrepair of water conservancy, and the inconvenience of transportation, the development is relatively slow. Of course, there are also many favorable conditions for these areas to develop production, that is, the masses work hard, have high awareness, and have the habit of being organized and the experience of labor competitions.
    The living standards of the people in the old base areas have been improving year by year (according to surveys in Ningdu, Yudu, and other counties, 70 percent of farmers have risen to the level of middle peasants), but on the whole, it is still quite low. Taking Ruijin as an example, the average actual income per person for the whole year in 1955 was only 42 yuan. And in Nanchang County, located in the Ganjiang River Basin, the average actual income per person for the whole year was 53.32 yuan. It can be seen from this that continuing to vigorously support the development of production so that people's lives can be further improved is still an urgent demand of the masses in the old base areas.
    In order to develop the economy of the old base areas, we have formulated a preliminary plan. There are several important issues in implementing the plan:
    One is the issue of water conservancy. Due to the devastation of the Kuomintang reactionaries, the forests in the old base areas have been damaged, water conservancy has been neglected for a long time, and soil erosion is serious. After liberation, although there has been some restoration, they are still often threatened by floods and droughts. This situation not only directly hinders the economic development of the old base areas but also brings a significant impact on the agricultural production of the entire province. In the future, in addition to continuing to mobilize the masses to actively plant trees and forests, do a good job in water and soil conservation, and build a large number of small-scale water conservancy projects, the state needs to provide financial assistance in order to develop some large and medium-sized water conservancy projects in a planned manner.
    One is the issue of developing transportation in the old base areas. The old base areas are mostly mountainous areas with few highways and silted river channels, making transportation inconvenient. This situation, on the one hand, hinders the development of diversified economies by utilizing the characteristics of the old base areas having many cash crops because many products cannot be transported out or the selling price is too low, making it unprofitable for producers. For example, raising pigs is not profitable, logging is not profitable, and the purchase price of Chinese herbal medicine Smilax glabra is four yuan per dan, while the retail price in pharmacies is two fen per qian (equivalent to 320 yuan per dan). On the other hand, it also affects the cultural development of the old base areas. At present, education is not very developed in most places, health and medical conditions are backward, and the population mortality rate, especially the infant mortality rate, although greatly reduced compared with before liberation, is still higher than in other areas. Therefore, in order to develop the economy and culture of the old base areas, transportation construction should be actively strengthened in the future.
    One is the issue of price policy and tax policy. This is a comprehensive issue, but it is more closely related to the old base areas. Because the old base areas are mostly mountainous, located in remote areas, the regional price differences and purchase and sales price differences are relatively large. Since 1951, Jiangxi's public grain burden has exceeded the national average burden rate every year. Although there have been reductions and exemptions for disaster-stricken areas and some considerations for the old base areas in the collection of public grain, the result is often that this reduction is offset by an increase elsewhere because the overall task has not been appropriately reduced; in addition, there are shortcomings in our implementation of policies, insufficient investigation of output, and inaccurate assessment, and the distribution of tasks is not completely reasonable, and some phenomena of being disproportionately light or heavy have also occurred. Generally speaking, the burden on the masses in the old base areas is somewhat heavy, which has caused dissatisfaction among some of the masses and affected the mobilization of their production enthusiasm. We believe that in the future, we should consider gradually reducing the sales price of industrial products and appropriately increasing the purchase price of agricultural products in order to reduce the price scissors differential, on the basis of ensuring price stability, from aspects such as reducing commodity management costs and reducing intermediate links in commodities. At the same time, the specific circumstances of the old base areas should be taken into account when considering the burdens on the masses, and appropriate reductions and exemptions must be made in areas with more difficulties.
    In the past few years, some of the masses in the old base areas (families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, and widowers, widows, and orphans) have relied on state relief to maintain their lives. After the realization of advanced cooperativization, their difficulties should be mainly solved from the aspect of developing production. However, a new problem has emerged in some places in the old base areas, that is, there are too many "five guarantees" households, and the members cannot support them. Therefore, in such places, in a relatively long period of time in the future, the state still needs to provide necessary relief subsidies.
    Developing the economy of the old base areas is a problem involving many aspects. In addition to grasping the above key links, we must also actively develop local industries under the unified national plan. The old base areas have many mineral deposits and abundant economic resources of various kinds, which are extremely favorable conditions for developing local industries.
    Second, the issue of training veteran cadres and mobilizing the enthusiasm of veteran cadres.
    To mobilize the enthusiasm of the people in the old base areas, we must first mobilize the enthusiasm of the cadres in the old base areas (hereinafter referred to as veteran cadres). It is estimated that there are about 300,000 Party members, Youth League members, and cadres at all levels in the province during the Second Revolutionary Civil War (including 50,000 to 60,000 main cadres at the township level and above). Among these 300,000 people, with the exception of a small number of traitors and those who resolutely engaged in counter-revolutionary work after betraying the Party, the vast majority are good or basically good. They are large in number, widely distributed, and have close ties with the masses.
    In the past few years, we have carried out a lot of work in training and using veteran cadres. The Provincial Party Committee has trained a large number of cadres in succession, and most of the main backbone members of villages and towns before the "Three Antis" movement were veteran cadres. In various movements, a large number of new cadres have been trained and promoted, many of whom are family members of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers and children of veteran cadres. To do a good job in the old base areas, there is a very important experience: wherever attention is paid to training, using, and uniting veteran cadres, the masses are more easily mobilized, and various work tasks can be completed more smoothly; otherwise, it will affect the mobilization of the enthusiasm of the masses and cause some unnecessary difficulties in the work. Therefore, neglecting the training, use, and unity of veteran cadres is wrong. However, it is also detrimental to the work to only pay attention to training and promoting veteran cadres and not pay attention to training and promoting a large number of new cadres in various movements.
    In the past few years, Party committees at all levels in our province have generally paid attention to the training, use, and unity of new and veteran cadres, but some places have not paid enough attention to the use and unity of veteran cadres. Especially after a large number of new cadres have grown up, there has been a tendency to squeeze out veteran cadres, which has affected the unity between new and veteran cadres, aroused dissatisfaction among cadres and masses in the old base areas, and affected the smooth completion of various tasks. The main reason for these problems is that some cadres have a blind sectarian sentiment, do not have a sufficient understanding of the role played by veteran cadres in history, and excessively exaggerate the shortcomings of some veteran cadres.
    At present, the biggest complaint of veteran cadres is that they are not trusted enough and not respected enough. They ask to participate in work and ask to resolve their party membership issues. We must pay attention to these demands and resolve them reasonably according to different situations. For those who ask to participate in work, although it is impossible to turn them all into full-time cadres, we can absorb them to participate in appropriate work according to the standards of both ability and integrity, especially to absorb them in large numbers to participate in the leadership of grass-roots organizations. For those who ask to join the Party, we can actively and seriously handle them separately according to the Party's organizational principles. We must educate cadres at all levels to treat veteran cadres with a correct attitude, be good at working with veteran cadres, patiently and warmly help veteran cadres, and constantly improve their ideological and political level.
    Finally, it is the issue of carrying forward the fine traditions of the old base areas.
    Under the long-term cultivation of the Party and Chairman Mao, the cadres in the old base areas have developed a fine style of being hardworking and thorough, united and friendly, and connecting with the masses; due to the habit of democratic life in the past, they have a better democratic style and a spirit of criticism and self-criticism.
    Generally speaking, cadres at all levels currently attach importance to the fine traditions of the old base areas, but some cadres neglect the fine traditions of the old base areas. They believe that those veteran cadres and masses who dare to offer opinions and dare to criticize are naughty and difficult to lead, and some people even discriminate against and attack veteran cadres. They do not understand that fully promoting democracy and daring to criticize the shortcomings and errors in our work are precisely the advantages and good style of the cadres in the old base areas and also a style that our Party actively advocates.
    At the Provincial Party Congress in July, through criticism and self-criticism, the shortcomings in our work were fully exposed. To sum up, the most prominent shortcoming is that there is a relatively widespread ideological style of subjectivism, bureaucracy, and commandism in our work, as well as a blind sectarian sentiment among some cadres.
    Of course, there are many reasons for the emergence of these erroneous ideological styles, but the fact that our leading organs and leading cadres do not pay attention to going deep into reality, connecting with the masses, lack a democratic style, and lack a spirit of self-criticism cannot but be an important reason. It can be seen from this that carrying forward the glorious traditions of the old base areas, further establishing the fine style of cadres working hard and thoroughly and closely connecting with the masses, strengthening the mass concept of cadres, and caring about the interests of the masses anytime and anywhere have great practical significance for improving leadership and improving work.
    Jiangxi is located in the direct rear of the national defense front line and has abundant material resources and favorable natural conditions. We believe that in the future, in addition to continuing to vigorously develop agriculture, we should also strengthen the construction of local industries, so as to more effectively support the state's key construction and national defense construction. We must follow the spirit of the congress, overcome the shortcomings and errors in our past work, carry forward the glorious revolutionary traditions, and advance victoriously in the great socialist construction cause.

    加强革命老根据地的工作
    中共江西省委员会第一书记　杨尚奎同志的发言
    江西代表完全同意刘少奇同志、周恩来同志、邓小平同志的报告。
    七年来，在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，江西的工作是有成绩的。我们坚决贯彻执行了党的方针政策，完成了各个时期的工作任务，基本上实现了对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，工农业生产也有了很大的增长，人民群众的生活获得了显著的改善。但是我们在工作中也存在着很多缺点和错误。现仅就加强老根据地工作问题，发表一些意见。
    江西共有八十二个县，老根据地面积占全省三分之二以上。全省人口1700万，老根据地人口占全省二分之一以上。因此，进一步发挥老根据地人民的积极性，是发挥全省人民积极性的一个重要关键。
    江西老根据地人民在我们党的领导下，曾经进行过长期艰苦的斗争，特别是第二次国内革命战争时期，在党中央和毛主席的直接领导下，对革命事业做了重大的贡献，同时也付出了极大的代价。在国民党反动统治时期，有上百万人遭受屠杀，全省人口减少了四分之一，无数的村庄被被毁灭了，田园荒芜了。但是老根据地人民的革命意志是坚强的。红军北上抗日后，他们一刻也没有停止对敌人的斗争。解放后他们又积极地参加了各种工作，和党建立了血肉相联的关系。
    解放以来，江西各级党组织对于老根据地工作是重视的。通过扶助生产、优抚救济、负担减免，吸收和培养了一部分老干部参加工作，解决了一部分老干部的党籍问题，对第三次“左”倾机会主义路线时期被诬害的党员和群众进行了平反等等一系列的工作，提高了老根据地人民的积极性，大大地密切了党和老根据地人民的联系。
    我们认为今后要更全面地加强老根据地的工作，进一步发挥老根据地人民建设社会主义的积极性，主要应该掌握以下几个环节：
    首先，是发展经济改善人民生活问题。
    经过几年来的工作，老根据地的经济，除少数深山僻壤的地方外，虽然已经全部恢复并且超过了战前的最高水平，但由于劳动力少（烈、军、干属比例大，鳏寡孤独多）、水利失修、交通不便等原因，发展是比较慢的。当然这些地区发展生产也有许多有利条件，就是群众劳动好，觉悟高，有组织起来的习惯和劳动竞赛的经验。
      老根据地人民的生活水平，虽逐年有所提高（据宁都、雩都等县调查，有百分之七十的农户已上升到中农生活水平），但总的来说，还是相当低的。以瑞金为例，一九五五年每人全年的实际收入平均只有四十二元。而地处赣江盆地的南昌县，每人全年的实际收入平均为五十三·三二元。由此可见，继续大力扶助发展生产，使人民生活得到更多的改善，仍然是老根据地群众的迫切要求。
    为了发展老根据地的经济，我们已制定了初步规划。在执行规划中有以下几个重要问题：
    一个是水利问题。由于国民党反动派的摧残，老根据地的山林遭受破坏，水利年久失修，水土流失严重，解放后，虽有一定的恢复，但仍经常受到水旱灾害的威胁。这种情况，不仅直接妨害着老根据地经济的发展，而且对全省的农业生产带来了重大影响。今后除继续动员群众积极植树造林、做好水土保持、大量兴修小型水利外，还需要国家予以资助，以便有计划地发展一些大中型水利工程。
    一个是发展老根据地的交通问题。老根据地多属山区，公路较少，河道淤塞，交通不便。这种情况，一方面妨碍着利用老根据地经济作物多的特点来发展多种经济，因为有许多产品运不出来或销价太低，使生产者无利可图。如养猪无利，砍伐木材无利，中药土茯苓收购价格为四元一担，而药店零售价格每钱二分（合三百二十元一担）。另一方面也影响了老根据地的文化发展，现在多数地方教育不很发达，卫生医疗条件落后，人口死亡率特别是婴儿死亡率虽较解放前大为降低，但仍高于其他地区。因此，为了发展老根据地的经济文化，今后应积极加强交通建设。
    一个是关于价格政策和税收政策的问题。这是一个全面性的问题，但对老根据地的关系更为密切。因老根据地多属山区，地处边远，地区差价和购销差价都比较大。江西公粮负担从一九五一年以来历年都超过全国的平均负担率。在征收公粮中虽有受灾减免和对老根据地的某些照顾，但由于总的任务未能适当减少，其结果往往是此减彼增；加之我们在执行政策上有缺点，对产量调查不够，摸底不实，任务分配不够完全合理，也发生了一些畸轻畸重的现象。总的说来，老根据地群众的负担是重了一些，以致引起了某些群众的不满，并影响了他们的生产积极性的发挥。我们认为，今后应当考虑在保证物价稳定的基础上，从降低商品管理费用、减少商品中间环节等方面，逐步降低工业品的销售价格和适当提高农产品的收购价格，以缩小剪刀差。同时，对于群众的负担应照顾老根据地的具体情况，在困难较多的地区，必须适当减免。
    过去几年来，老根据地的一部分群众（烈、军属和鳏寡孤独），依靠国家的救济维持生活，在实现了高级合作化以后，应该主要从发展生产方面来解决他们的困难。但是目前老根据地有些地方出现了一个新问题，就是五保户太多，社员背不起来。因此这类地方在今后一个较长的时期内，仍然需要国家给以必要的救济补助。
    发展老根据地的经济，是一个牵涉多方面的问题，除必须抓紧以上几个环节外，还要在国家统一计划下，积极发展地方工业。老根据地矿藏很多，各种经济资源较丰富，是发展地方工业的极为有利的条件。
    其次，是培养老干部和发挥老干部积极性的问题。
    要发挥老根据地人民的积极性，必须首先发挥老根据地干部（以下简称老干部）的积极性。第二次国内革命战争时期的党团员和各级干部，估计全省有三十万人左右（其中乡级以上的主要干部有五万到六万人）。这三十万人中，除了少数叛变分子和叛变后坚决做反革命工作的以外，绝大多数是好的或基本上是好的。他们数量大、分布广、和群众有密切联系。
    几年来，我们在培养使用老干部方面，进行了许多工作。省委曾先后训练了大批干部，“三反”以前乡村的主要骨干，大多数由老干部担任。在各种运动中又培养提拔了大批新干部，其中很多人是烈军属和老干部的子女。要做好老根据地的工作，有一条很重要的经验：凡是注意了培养、使用、团结老干部的地方，群众就更容易发动，各种工作任务就能够更顺利地完成；否则，就会影响群众积极性的发挥和使工作产生一些不必要的困难。所以忽视对老干部的培养、使用、团结是错误的。但是只注意培养和提拔老干部，不注意在各种运动中培养提拔大批的新干部，这对工作也是不利的。
    几年来，我省各级党委一般地都注意了对新老干部的培养、使用和团结，但有些地方对老干部的使用团结注意不够，特别是在大批新干部生长起来以后，产生了排挤老干部的偏向，以致影响了新老干部之间的团结，引起了老根据地干部和群众的不满，影响了各种任务的顺利完成。产生这些问题的原因，主要的是由于部分干部存在着盲目的宗派主义情绪，对老干部在历史上所起的作用认识不足，过分夸大了某些老干部的缺点。
    目前老干部对我们的最大意见，是对他们信任不够、尊重不够。他们要求参加工作，要求解决党籍问题。我们必须重视他们的这些要求，并根据不同情况，分别地予以合理的解决。对要求参加工作的，虽然不可能使他们都变成脱产干部，但可以根据德才标准吸收他们参加适当的工作，特别是大量吸收他们参加基层组织的领导。对要求入党的，可根据党的组织原则，积极和严肃地分别加以处理。我们要教育各级干部以正确的态度对待老干部，善于同老干部共同工作，耐心热情地帮助老干部，不断地提高他们的思想政治水平。
    最后是发扬老根据地的优良传统问题。
    老根据地干部在党和毛主席的长期培养下，养成了艰苦深入、团结友爱、联系群众的优良作风；由于过去民主生活的习惯，他们具有较好的民主作风和批评自我批评的精神。
    一般地说，目前各级干部对老根据地的优良传统是重视的，但也有部分干部对老根据地的优良传统比较忽视。他们认为那些敢于提意见敢于批评的老干部和群众，调皮捣蛋不好领导，有的人甚至于歧视打击老干部。他们不了解充分发扬民主，敢于批评我们工作中的缺点和错误，正是老根据地干部的优点和良好作风，也是我们党积极提倡的一种作风。
    在七月份全省党代表大会上，通过批评和自我批评，全面地揭发了我们工作中的缺点。归纳起来，最突出的缺点是我们工作中比较普遍地存在着主观主义、官僚主义和命令主义的思想作风，以及部分干部中存在着盲目的宗派主义情绪。
    当然，产生这些错误思想作风的原因是多方面的，但我们领导机关和领导干部不注意深入实际、联系群众，缺乏民主作风，缺乏自我批评的精神，不能不是一个重要原因。由此可见，发扬老根据地的光荣传统，进一步树立干部的艰苦深入工作密切联系群众的优良作风，加强干部的群众观念，随时随地关心群众的利益，这对于改进领导改进工作，具有重大的现实意义。
    江西处在国防前线的直接后方，又有着丰富的物质资源和有利的自然条件。我们认为，今后除继续大力发展农业外，还应该加强地方工业建设，从而更有力地支援国家的重点建设和国防建设。我们要遵照大会的精神，克服过去工作中的缺点和错误，发扬光荣的革命传统，在伟大的社会主义建设事业中胜利前进。
