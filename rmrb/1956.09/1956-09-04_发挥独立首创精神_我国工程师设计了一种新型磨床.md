Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, September 2nd: The state-owned Shanghai Machine Tool Plant, which has imitated more than 20 types of Soviet grinding machines, recently independently designed for the first time a universal and tool grinding machine that has a wide range of applications in China.

The engineer in charge of this design, Jin Wangxin, and a group of designers, spent ten months completing this new type of grinding machine that can be operated automatically. They successively referred to dozens of technical materials from home and abroad, especially studying the shortcomings of the "Qiu 13 Universal and Tool Grinding Machine," which the plant had designed five years ago by imitating an American grinding machine, and carried out independent design according to the needs of Chinese users. This grinding machine is now named "M612-1 Universal and Tool Grinding Machine," and the central competent department has approved the plant to carry out trial production.

This grinding machine, independently designed for the first time in China, adopts a modern cuboid structure, is light and dexterous, and has a lower manufacturing cost. It is equipped with three types of grinding wheels: flat, disc-shaped, and bowl-shaped, and can automatically grind the outer circle, inner circle, inner and outer cones, plane, inclined surface, and end face of mechanical parts, and can also grind various tools. The precision of cones and ellipses can reach no more than five microns (equivalent to one-twelfth the thickness of a hair). It has good versatility and is in great demand by tractor and automobile repair stations, as well as general mechanical factories and tool workshops. After formal production, the "Qiu 13 Universal and Tool Grinding Machine," which is still selling well in China, can be replaced by this new product with excellent performance.

Independently designing grinding machines is an important aspect of the enterprise transformation work that the Shanghai Machine Tool Plant is currently carrying out. The engineers who have gained experience in imitating Soviet grinding machines will continue to design new types of grinding machines according to the characteristics of Chinese users. Another engineer in the design department, Cao Zhirui, is responsible for designing a surface grinder, which will also be completed in October.

### 发挥独立首创精神  我国工程师设计了一种新型磨床

    发挥独立首创精神
    我国工程师设计了一种新型磨床
    新华社上海2日电　仿造了二十多种苏联磨床的国营上海机床厂，最近第一次独立地设计了一种在我国有广泛用途的万能及工具磨床。
    负责这项设计的工程师金望辛和一组设计人员，以十个月的时间完成了这台能够自动操作的新型磨床。他们先后参考了国内外几十种技术资料，特别是研究了这个厂五年以前模仿美国的磨床设计的“虬13式万能及工具磨床”的缺点，并且根据我国用户的需要，进行了独立的设计。这种磨床现在定名为“M612—1型万能及工具磨床”，中央主管部门已经批准这个厂进行试制。
    这种我国第一次独立设计的磨床，采用的是现代化的立方形结构，身轻灵巧，制造成本也较低。它装有平面、盘形和碗形三种砂轮，可以自动磨削机械零件的外圆、内圆、内外椎体、平面、斜面和端面，也可以磨制各种刀具；椎和椭圆的精密度，能达到不超过五公微（相当于一根头发的十二分之一粗细）。它的万能性好，拖拉机、汽车修理站和一般机械工厂、工具车间都很需要。在正式生产以后，目前在国内销路仍然很好的“虬13式万能及工具磨床”，就可以由这种性能良好的新产品代替。
    独立设计磨床，是上海机床厂现在正在进行的企业改造工作的一个重要的方面。仿造苏联磨床中取得经验的工程师们，将继续根据我国用户的特点，设计新品种磨床。设计科另一位工程师曹志瑞负责设计的一种平面磨床，也将在10月份完成。
