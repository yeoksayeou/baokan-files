Xinhua News Agency, Kunming—Yunnan Province is experiencing an unprecedented bumper harvest of autumn crops this year, with grain production expected to increase by 2.1 billion jin compared to last year, and economic crops expected to increase by approximately 50%. Currently, as the autumn harvest approaches, farmers across the province are paying close attention to the distribution issues after this year's bumper harvest. In order to strive for increased income for more than 90% of the members, agricultural cooperatives in various regions are simultaneously engaging in intensive production and conducting trial calculations for distribution. In five counties, including Yuxi, Eshan, Jinning, Shiping, and Fumin, more than 90% of the cooperatives have increased production this year. Trial calculations show that after deducting state grain quotas, sideline product taxes, production costs, accumulation funds, public welfare funds, administrative management fees, and publicly-owned share funds, approximately 70% of the fruits of labor can be distributed to members, enabling more than 90% of the members to increase their income; some cooperatives can achieve 100% of the members increasing their income.

During the trial calculation of distribution, agricultural cooperatives in various regions earnestly conducted ideological education for members, emphasizing the consideration of the interests of the state, the cooperative, and individual members. They also revised and supplemented production plans to fully utilize the time before the autumn harvest and make every effort to further increase agricultural and sideline production. The Qujing Special District replanted 100,000 mu of late autumn crops in five counties, including Malong and Xundian, which had suffered from floods. Agricultural cooperatives in Baoshan County put forward the slogan "Increase Production in Increased Production Cooperatives, Ensure Production in Production-Maintaining Cooperatives, Strive to Maintain Production in Reduced Production Cooperatives!" Advanced cooperatives sent their capable cadres to backward cooperatives to specifically help them improve production. District and township cadres also went deep into cooperatives and production teams to provide specific guidance for production. Some cooperatives mobilized members to plant melons and vegetables on the edges of walls and corners of land; others are organizing labor and arranging tasks, putting forward the slogan "Every grain returns home, do not scatter a single grain of food," striving to increase members' income.

According to Xinhua News Agency, the ongoing meeting of the heads of the production cooperation departments of the Yunnan Provincial Party Committee and various cities has conducted a detailed study of this year's autumn harvest distribution work.

The meeting pointed out that the total value of agricultural and sideline production in the province this year is estimated to increase by more than 20% compared to last year, while the state's agricultural tax will not increase compared to last year. As long as we insist on distributing more than 65% of the total income to the members, it is possible to enable more than 90% of the members to increase their income. However, due to reduced production in some areas due to disasters compared to last year, and the fact that sideline production in various regions was once in a state of stagnation, in order to ensure that more than 90% of the members increase their income, it is still necessary to further improve agricultural and sideline production in the one and a half to two months before the autumn harvest, and strive for increased production and increased income.

After analyzing the specific situation of members whose income may decrease this year, the meeting tentatively decided that while distributing according to the principle of remuneration according to labor, appropriate subsidies and relief should be given to members such as "five guarantees" households and families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers whose income has decreased. For handicraftsmen who are still evaluated and credited for their agricultural labor, labor points should be appropriately increased so that their income this year is not lower than in previous years.

The meeting especially emphasized the need to take care of ethnic minority members with lower production technology levels and fewer labor points in the distribution. At present, agricultural cooperatives composed of two or more ethnic groups generally have an imbalance or excessive disparity in labor remuneration caused by differences in the advancement and backwardness of agricultural and sideline technologies between ethnic groups. Therefore, on the one hand, agricultural cooperatives should divide labor according to the characteristics and specializations of each ethnic group to develop diversified operations, so that they can strive to obtain more income, and on the other hand, their special needs should also be taken care of in the distribution.

### “增产社再增产，保产社要增产，减产社要保产！”  云南力求更多社员增加收入

    “增产社再增产，保产社要增产，减产社要保产！”
    云南力求更多社员增加收入
    本报昆明讯　云南省今秋农作物出现空前未有的丰收景象，预计粮食将比去年增产二十一亿斤；经济作物将增产50％左右。目前，秋收将近，全省农民都在注视着今年大丰收后的分配问题。为争取90％以上的社员增加收入，各地农业社正在一面从事紧张的生产，一面进行分配试算。玉溪、峨山、晋宁、石屏、富民等五个县，今年90％以上的社增加了生产。试算的结果，把国家的公粮、副业税、生产成本、公积金、公益金、行政管理费和公有化股份基金等除去，可将70％左右的劳动果实分给社员，使90％以上的社员增加收入；个别社可以作到100％的社员增加收入。
    在试算分配的时候，各地农业社认真地向社员进行了国家、合作社、社员个人三方面利益兼顾的思想教育；还修订补订了生产计划，要充分利用秋收前的一段时间，尽一切努力使农业、副业生产都能再有所增加。曲靖专区在遭受水灾的马龙、寻甸等五个县内，抢种和补种了晚秋作物十万亩。保山县的农业社提出“增产社再增产，保产社要增产，减产社要保产”的口号。先进社把自己得力的干部派往落后社，具体帮助他们搞好生产。区、乡干部也深入合作社和生产队，具体指导生产。有的社动员社员在墙边地角种植瓜菜；有的社正在组织劳力安排活计，提出“颗粒还家，不抛撒一粒粮食”的口号，力求使社员增加更多的收入。
    据新华社讯　正在举行的中共云南省各地、市委生产合作部部长会议，对今年秋收分配工作作了详细的研究。
    会议指出：估计今年全省农副业总产值可比去年增加二成多，而国家的农业税不比去年增加，只要坚持把总收入的65％以上分给社员，就可能使90％以上社员增加收入。但是，由于若干地区受灾比去年减产，同时，各地的副业生产曾一度处于停滞状态，要想保证90％以上的社员增加收入，在秋收前一个半月至两个月的时间内，还必须进一步搞好农副业生产，争取增产和增加收入。
    会议分析了今年可能减少收入的社员的具体情况后，初步决定：在根据按劳取酬的原则进行分配的同时，对“五保”户和烈、军属等减少收入的社员，应给予一定的补贴和救济，对现在仍按农业劳动评工记分的手工业者等，应该适当提高劳动工分，使他们今年的收入不低于往年。
    会议特别提出了在分配中要照顾生产技术水平较低、劳动工分挣得少的少数民族社员。现在各地两种以上民族组成的农业社，都普遍存在着因各民族之间农、副业技术先进与落后的差别所引起的劳动报酬不平衡或过于悬殊的情况。因此，一方面农业社要根据各民族的特点、专长分工，开展多种经营，使他们争取获得更多的收入，另方面在分配中还应照顾他们的特殊需要。
