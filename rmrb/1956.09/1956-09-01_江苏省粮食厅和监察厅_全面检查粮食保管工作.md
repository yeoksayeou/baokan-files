Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 30th - The Jiangsu Provincial Grain Bureau and Supervision Department recently organized eighty work groups to conduct a general inspection of the province's grain storage and the "Four Withouts" (no pests, no mold, no rodents/birds, no accidents) granary campaign. The inspection revealed many problems in grain storage work. The Jiangsu Provincial Grain Bureau has already held a symposium of directors of grain bureaus and prevention team (group) leaders from various special districts and cities to study improvement measures based on the issues identified during the inspection.

The problems discovered in this inspection are quite serious. The number of insect-infested grains has generally increased, and the pest situation is severe. According to statistics from this inspection, the province already has 1.3 billion jin of insect-infested grain. The most serious case is Yangzhou Special District, where the amount of insect-infested grain accounts for over 72% of the total grain reserves in the district. In Huai'an County, the current amount of insect-infested grain accounts for 93% of the total grain reserves. The phenomenon of grain heating, molding, rotting, and sprouting is also relatively common. During this inspection, a total of 8.63 million jin of heating grain was discovered throughout the province. Although rodent and bird damage has decreased somewhat, it remains serious. According to incomplete statistics from the inspection, approximately 1 billion jin of grain in warehouses across the province has been damaged by rodents and birds. The inspection also revealed some cases of losses in warehouse grain due to accidents such as fires and thefts.

The inspection work groups also found that some processing plants and purchasing and sales stations are weak links in grain storage work. Some processing plants and purchasing and sales stations have not yet launched the "Four Withouts" granary campaign. Some warehouses have not yet established a grain storage system. Therefore, the phenomenon of grain loss in many processing plants and purchasing and sales stations is also relatively serious.

The Jiangsu Provincial Grain Bureau recently convened a symposium of directors of grain bureaus and prevention team (group) leaders from various special districts and cities. The meeting seriously studied the problems discovered during the inspection. In addition to formulating specific measures to prevent and control insect pests and mold, and to strengthen and expand the prevention and control force, the meeting pointed out that it is necessary to earnestly strengthen leadership in grain storage work and conduct political and ideological education for cadres. Each special district, county, and city grain bureau should have a director personally responsible for grain storage work. Warehouse directors and other heads of grain management units should strengthen specific leadership and earnestly solve problems. In terms of strengthening ideological leadership, criticism and praise should be frequently conducted to overcome complacency, laxity, negativity, and fear of difficulties, so as to improve the work enthusiasm and sense of responsibility of cadres. Those cities, counties, and districts that have not yet established guidance organizations for the "Four Withouts" granary campaign should strive to establish them all within the next month. Those that have already been established but are merely a formality should be rectified, and some cadres should be transferred to quickly launch the "Four Withouts" campaign. Processing plants and purchasing and sales stations should also quickly launch the "Four Withouts" granary campaign. The meeting also expressed the hope that supervisory departments at all levels will include supervising and inspecting grain storage work and promoting the "Four Withouts" granary campaign as one of their daily key tasks, urging grain departments to earnestly implement the instructions from higher authorities regarding grain storage work, studying the plans proposed by the grain departments in each period, and checking the completion status, so as to promote grain storage work and the "Four Withouts" granary campaign and ensure the safety of state property.

    全面检查粮食保管工作
    新华社南京30日电　江苏省粮食厅和监察厅最近组织了八十个工作组对全省的粮食保管和开展“四无”（无虫害、无霉变、无鼠雀、无事故）粮仓运动等工作进行了普查。在普查中发现粮食保管工作中存在许多问题。江苏省粮食厅已就检查出的问题，召开了专区、市粮食局长和防治队（组）长座谈会，研究了改进办法。
    这次普查所发现的问题是比较严重的，虫粮数字普遍增加，虫害情况严重。据这次普查材料的统计，全省虫粮已有了十三亿斤。其中最严重的是扬州专区。这个专区的虫粮数字已占全区存粮总数的72％强。淮安县的现有虫粮数字占存粮总数的93％。粮食发热、霉变、霉烂、生芽现象也比较普遍。在这次普查中，全省共发现发热粮食有八百六十三万斤。鼠害雀害虽然有了减少，但仍很严重。据普查中的不完全统计，全省遭受到鼠雀危害的仓库粮食，共约十亿斤。在这次普查中，还发现一些因失火和盗窃等事故而使仓库存粮遭到损失的情况。
    普查工作组在普查中还发现各地有一些加工厂和购销站是粮食保管工作中的薄弱环节。有一些加工厂和购销站还没有开展“四无”粮仓运动。有些仓房还没有建立粮食保管制度。因此，许多加工厂和购销站所发生的损失粮食的现象也是比较严重的。
    江苏省粮食厅最近召开了各专区、市粮食局长和防治队（组）长座谈会。会上就普查中所发现的问题作了认真的研究。会议除对防治虫害、霉烂，充实和扩大防治力量等问题拟定了具体措施外，并指出要认真加强保管粮食工作的领导和对干部的政治思想教育。各专、县、市粮食局要有一个局长亲自负责保管粮食工作，仓库主任和其他粮食管理单位的负责人应该加强具体领导，认真解决问题。在加强思想领导方面，应该经常开展批评和进行表扬，克服麻痹、松懈、消极和畏难的思想，以提高干部的工作积极性和责任心。各市、县、区尚未建立“四无”粮仓运动指导组织的，应争取在最近一月内全部建立起来，已经建立起来而流于形式的，应加以整顿，并调配一些干部，迅速开展“四无”运动。加工厂和购销站也应迅速开展“四无”粮仓运动。会议还希望各级监察部门将监督检查粮食保管工作和推动“四无”粮仓运动列为日常重点工作之一，督促粮食部门切实贯彻执行上级有关保管粮食工作的指示，研究粮食部门每一时期所提出的计划和检查完成情况，以推动粮食保管工作和“四无”粮仓运动，保障国家财富的安全。
