    Arranging and Transforming the Old Bookstore Industry
    Recently, academic and cultural circles have gradually begun to value the research work on the national cultural heritage. The demand for classical texts has greatly increased, and the old book market is unprecedentedly prosperous, with a significant rise in the turnover of the old book industry. This is certainly a good phenomenon.
    However, some local cultural departments, due to insufficient understanding of the nature and characteristics of this industry and its role in cultural and academic undertakings, regard the old book industry as dispensable, and therefore abandon leadership of this industry without making practical arrangements. Even a small number of local cultural departments, during the high tide of socialist transformation in the spring of this year, took hasty and crude measures against the old book industry, seriously affecting its development and hindering the circulation and supply of ancient books. They implemented the so-called "replacing the old with the new" approach to the old book industry, allowing this industry and its specialized personnel to switch to selling new books or engage in other industries; they treated existing ancient books and many publications of important value as waste paper sold by weight, or only sold existing stock and no longer purchased new stock. They blindly transformed the old book industry into state-owned or joint state-private ownership, inappropriately implementing asset verification, fixed interest rates, and fixed salaries, and also stipulated some operating methods and work systems that were unsuitable for the industry's characteristics. As a result, this industry, which originally played a significant role in cultural and academic undertakings, has been unduly weakened, affecting the enthusiasm of the industry and its employees, and seriously hindering the work of collecting, preserving, and supplying ancient books.
    Classical texts are an extremely valuable cultural heritage of our country. Conducting extensive collection and collation of these classical texts, and carrying out in-depth research and full utilization, is not only extremely important for correctly understanding the development process of our country's history and culture, but also of great significance for promoting the construction of our socialist culture. However, for a long time, these classical texts have been scattered in large quantities among the people. It is certainly not an easy task to carefully select from these large quantities of scattered old books and collect valuable ancient books for utilization. This not only requires relying on the enthusiasm and initiative of the broad masses to cherish the cultural heritage of the motherland, the establishment of specialized institutions by the state and the adoption of certain administrative measures, but also must rely on specialized industries and specialized talents in society.
    Many of the employees in the old book industry are specialized personnel with the skills to identify ancient books and repair them. They understand the collection of ancient books, know how to collect ancient books, and have close ties with academic institutions, scholars and experts, folk ancient book collectors, and small vendors who collect and sell ancient books in urban and rural areas. They play an important role in collecting, preserving, and circulating ancient books. The old book industry is an industry with the nature of social and cultural services, which is different from general private commerce. Such an industry has many characteristics that are different from general commerce in terms of business operations. For example, people engaged in this industry must have specialized skills; owners are often the main business and technical personnel in the shops, and mostly participate directly in labor. This industry does not have a unified source of goods, and people who are familiar with the ways and means are needed to find the ancient books that need to be purchased; ancient books do not have a unified fixed price, and the purchase and sale price must be determined based on the variety and version of the book, as well as the circumstances of the seller and buyer. In addition, the turnover of goods in the old book industry is slow, and the capital is tied up for a long period of time, so the profit is relatively high.
    Obviously, the methods of carrying out socialist transformation of general capitalist commerce cannot be applied to the old book industry. It is necessary to transform this industry. However, the transformation should be carried out from the perspective of the industry's nature and operating characteristics, and different methods should be adopted. For this industry, the first and main thing is not to carry out transformation economically, but to strengthen their leadership, management and supervision administratively, give full play to their strengths and enthusiasm, promote them to improve management, and strengthen the collection, preservation and circulation of ancient books, so that they can better serve scientific research workers. The cultural departments should grasp their book catalogs to prevent the loss and export of precious classical texts. In terms of business operations, generally do not disrupt them, and let them maintain their original operating methods and characteristics. The original system of negotiated pricing among peers in the old book industry plays a certain role in determining reasonable prices for ancient books and should be maintained. When negotiating prices, the interests of both academic research workers and the old book industry should be taken into account. Do not raise book prices indefinitely, nor blindly lower book prices. Professionals with real talent and learning in the old book industry, including owners, should be treated as technical experts and used well. Do not let them change jobs casually. At the same time, we should also strengthen the regular political leadership and ideological education of the old bookstore operators, so that they can correctly understand the role of this industry and the country's policies towards them, strive to improve business management, protect classical texts, actively impart experience, and cultivate talents for the country to identify and repair ancient books.
    Timely correcting the shortcomings in the work of managing the private old book industry, strengthening the arrangement and transformation of the old book industry, and especially actively leading them to open up sources of goods and expand the circulation of ancient books, is an important task of the current cultural departments. If this task is completed well, not only will this social industry be properly arranged, but also it will play a good role in inheriting and carrying forward the cultural heritage of the motherland and promoting the prosperity of my country's science and culture.

### 安排和改造古书业

    安排和改造古书业
    最近一个时期，学术文化界对民族文化遗产的研究工作逐渐重视起来，对于古典文籍的需要大大增加，古籍市场空前繁荣，古书业的营业额显著上升。这当然是好现象。
    可是，有一些地区的文化部门因为对于这个行业的性质、特点和它在文化学术事业上的作用认识不足，把古书业看作是可有可无的，因此对这个行业放弃领导，没有进行切实的安排。甚至有少数地区的文化部门，在今年春天的社会主义改造的高潮中，对古书业采取了急躁的粗暴的措施，严重地影响了古书业的发展，妨碍了古籍的流通和供应。他们对古书业实行所谓“以新代旧”的作法，让这个行业和它的从业人员中的专门人才，改营新书或者从事其他行业；把古书业现存的古籍和许多有重要价值的书刊当作废纸论斤出售，或者只出售存货，不再进货。他们盲目地把古书业改为国营或者公私合营，不适当地对它们实行清产核资、定股定息和固定薪金，并且还规定了一些不适合于这个行业的活动特点的经营方法和工作制度。结果，使得这个本来在文化学术事业上有很大作用的行业受到了不应有的削弱，影响了这个行业和它的从业人员的积极性，使古籍的搜集、保存和供应工作受到严重的阻碍。
    古典文籍是我国极其宝贵的文化遗产。对于这些古典文籍进行广泛的搜集、整理，并且加以深入的研究和充分的利用，不但对于正确了解我国历史文化的发展过程有极其重要的作用，而且对于促进我国社会主义文化的建设，有很大的意义。但是长久以来，这些古典文籍大量流散在民间。要在这些大量的、分散的旧版书中，加以精选，把珍贵的古籍搜集起来加以利用，当然不是一件容易的事。这不但需要依靠广大群众爱护祖国文化遗产的热情和积极性，需要由国家设立专门的机构和采取一定的行政措施，而且还必须依靠社会上的专门行业和专门的人才来进行。
    古书业的从业人员中，有很多是具有鉴别古籍和有修整古书技能的专门人才。他们了解古书的收藏情况，知道如何搜罗古书，并且同学术机关、学者和专家、民间古书收藏家和各地城乡收售古书的小商小贩有着密切的联系，他们对于搜集、保存和流通古籍起着重要的作用。古书业是一种社会文化服务性质的行业，它和一般的私营商业是不同的。这样的行业，在业务经营上，有许多和一般商业不同的特点。例如：经营这个行业的人要有专门技能；业主往往是店铺中的主要业务技术人员，而且大都直接参加劳动。这个行业没有统一的货源，要有熟悉门路的人，才能找到需要收买的古籍；古籍没有统一的固定价格，要看书籍的品种和版本以及卖主买主的情形，来规定收购和出售的价格。此外，古书业的商品周转慢，资金积压时期长，所以利润也比较高。
    对于古书业，显然不能够套用对一般资本主义商业进行社会主义改造的办法。对这个行业进行改造，是必需的。但是应当从这个行业的性质和它的经营特点出发，采取不同的办法来进行改造。对于这个行业，首先和主要的不是从经济上来实行改造，而是应当在行政上加强对他们的领导、管理和监督，发挥他们的特长和积极性，推动他们改善经营，加强对古籍的搜集、保存和流通，使他们能够更好地为科学研究工作者服务。文化部门应当掌握他们的图书目录，防止珍贵的古典文籍流失和出口。在业务经营上，一般地不要去打乱他们，让他们保持原有的经营方法和特点。古书业中原有的同行议价制度，对于规定古籍的合理价格，有一定作用，应当继续保持。议价时应当照顾学术研究工作者和古书业者双方的利益，既不要无限制地提高书价，也不要盲目地压低书价。对古书业中有真才实学的专业人员，包括业主在内，应该当作技术专家看待，要好好地使用他们，决不要随便地让他们转业。同时，还应该加强对古书业者经常的政治领导和思想教育的工作，使他们正确地了解这个行业的作用和国家对他们的政策，努力改善经营管理，保护古典文籍，积极地传授经验，为国家培养鉴别古书和修整古书的人才。
    适时地纠正管理私营古书业工作中的缺点，加强对古书业的安排和改造，特别是积极地领导他们开辟货源，扩大古籍流通，是当前文化部门的一个重要任务。这个任务完成得好，不仅可以使这一个社会行业能够得到妥善的安排，而且对于继承和发扬祖国文化遗产，促进我国科学文化的繁荣，将会起到良好的作用。
