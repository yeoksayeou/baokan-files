Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 12th: The Third Rural Work Secretaries Conference of the Heilongjiang Provincial Party Committee, held from the 4th to the 10th, mainly studied the issues of strengthening production increase and ensuring harvest, ensuring that the produced grain is safely stored, carrying out autumn harvest distribution well, and ensuring that more than 90% of cooperative members increase their income. This year, except for 10% of the farmland in Heilongjiang Province that suffered from floods, the field crops in other areas have generally grown better than last year, and a bumper harvest is in sight. The meeting believed that it is possible to complete the grain production increase target of nine million tons, which is part of the first Five-Year Plan, one year ahead of schedule. However, the key to completing this target lies in the quality of work in increasing production and ensuring harvest. In particular, the province has suffered the most serious flood since liberation this year, with about 300,000 hectares of farmland experiencing crop failure and 400,000 hectares of farmland suffering from disaster and reduced production. The meeting requested vigorous efforts to increase production and ensure harvest, promote early maturity of crops, and ensure that every grain is safely stored. Bumper harvest areas should not be blindly optimistic because they believe that a bumper harvest is already determined, and disaster areas should not be pessimistic and disappointed. Cooperatives severely affected by the disaster should also try their best to harvest as much as possible, even if it's just one mu, and collect every grain in the field. Cooperatives that may reduce production should strive to reduce production as little as possible or not at all. At the same time, it is necessary to actively develop sideline production to increase the income of agricultural cooperatives. The meeting especially pointed out: there are still half a month left before the harvest, and all disasters and losses must be prevented. All localities must prepare sufficient firewood and grass for smoking to prevent frost.

In the past, from harvesting to threshing, more than 400,000 to 500,000 tons of grain were wasted every year due to missed cutting, missed hauling, missed threshing, and damage by livestock and poultry. Therefore, it is required that in this year's autumn harvest, attention must be paid to saving grain, achieving careful cutting, careful hauling, and careful threshing, and building walls around the threshing grounds to prevent grain loss and ensure that every grain is safely stored.

The meeting also made arrangements for this year's autumn harvest distribution work. The meeting believed that this year's income distribution of agricultural cooperatives is the first autumn harvest distribution after the province achieved advanced agricultural cooperativization. Not only does this distribution affect the cooperative members' views on the cooperatives, but the agricultural cooperatives will also establish a new distribution system through the first distribution. The meeting emphasized that it is necessary to implement the principle of combining personal interests, cooperative interests, and national interests, deducting less and distributing more, and ensuring that more than 90% of cooperative members increase their income. General cooperatives should distribute 60% to 70% of their income to cooperative members and appropriately stipulate the proportion of public welfare funds, accumulation funds, and in-cooperative production costs. For cooperative members who cannot increase their income due to long-term illness, less labor, large population, families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, the elderly, the weak, and the disabled, they should be assigned more work suitable for their physical strength as much as possible, and try to find ways to enable them to earn more income. Those who have lost their ability to work can be subsidized for their living expenses by public welfare funds. The meeting also pointed out that in the autumn harvest distribution work, it is necessary to adhere to the principle of distribution according to work and dividend according to labor days. However, appropriate adjustments should be made to certain irrational labor quotas and piece-rate standards for contracting work and output. The production team's overproduction reward system must also be implemented. At the meeting, the handling of several economic problems left over from the merger and upgrading of cooperatives and related issues in the distribution work were studied and stipulated separately.

The meeting emphasized: Strengthening production increase and ensuring harvest, and doing a good job in autumn harvest distribution are the foundations for ensuring that more than 90% of cooperative members increase their income and completing the grain production increase target of the first Five-Year Plan one year ahead of schedule. The meeting pointed out: Increasing production and ensuring harvest and autumn harvest distribution should become the central tasks of current rural work.

    黑龙江省确定当前农村中心任务
    做好增产保收和分配工作
    新华社哈尔滨12日电4日到10日中共黑龙江省委农村工作部召开的第三次各地、市、县委农村工作部长会议，主要研究了加强增产保收，使生产的粮食颗粒归仓，作好秋收分配，保证90％以上的社员增加收入等问题。今年黑龙江省除10％的农田受水灾外，其他地区大田作物普遍比去年生长的好，丰收在望。会议认为提前一年完成第一个五年计划——九百万吨的粮食增产指标是可能的。但完成这一指标的关键在于增产保收工作的好坏。特别是本省今年遭受了解放以来最严重的水灾，约三十万公顷农田绝产，四十万公顷农田受灾减产。会议要求大力开展增产保收，促进作物早熟，颗粒粮食归仓，丰收地区不要认为丰产已定而产生盲目乐观，灾区不要悲观失望，受灾严重的社也尽量做到能收一亩收一亩，地里有一颗收一颗。可能减产的社力争少减产或不减产。同时要积极开展副业生产，以增加农业社的收入。会议特别指出：离收割还有半月时间，必须防止一切灾害和损失。各地一定要准备充分的柴草，以备沤烟防霜。
    过去在收割到打场的过程中，因为漏割、漏拉、漏打和牲口、家禽糟踏，每年浪费的粮食都有四、五十万吨以上。所以要求在今年秋收过程中，一定要注意节约粮食，做到细割、细拉、细打并在场园立起围墙，防止粮食损失，使颗粒归仓。
    会议对今年的秋收分配工作也进行了安排。会议认为今年农业社的收益分配，是全省实现高级农业合作化后的第一次秋收分配。不仅这次分配影响到社员对合作社的看法，同时农业社将通过第一次分配来建立新的分配制度。会议强调必须贯彻个人利益、合作社利益和国家利益相结合，少扣多分，保证90％以上社员增加收入的原则。一般的合作社都要把收入的60％到70％分给社员。并适当的规定公益金、公积金和社内生产费的比例。对不能增加收入的长年生病、劳力少人口多、烈军属、老弱残疾等社员，尽量多分配一些适合他们体力的工作，想办法使他们能多收入，丧失劳动能力者，可由公益金补助其生活。会议还指出了在秋收分配工作中一定要坚持按劳取酬的原则，按劳动日分红。但对某些包工包产劳动定额和计工标准不合理的，应做适当调整。生产队超产奖励制度也一定要实行。会上对合作社并社升级遗留下来的若干经济问题的处理和分配工作中的有关问题，都分别进行研究作出了规定。
    会议强调指出：加强增产保收工作，做好秋收分配是保证90％以上的社员增加收入和提前一年完成第一个五年计划粮食增产指标的基础。会议指出：增产保收和秋收分配应成为当前农村工作的中心任务。
