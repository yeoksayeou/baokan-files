Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 11th. A railway survey team dispatched by the First Design Institute of the Ministry of Railways has followed in the footsteps of petroleum exploration personnel and entered the Karamay Oilfield. Where the railway survey team has surveyed, small red flags marking the possible routes of the railway line have been planted.

Railway surveyors are determined to complete the preliminary survey of the railway from Dushanzi on the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway via Karamay to Altay in the short term, so as to determine the direction of this railway line from several preliminary survey comparison lines and submit design opinions by the end of this year.

From Dushanzi to Karamay, it is estimated to be 160 kilometers long. The railway line will extend north from Karamay through the Urho oil exploration area to Altay in the northern part of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, which has forest resources and underground treasures nearby.

The entire length of the railway line connecting the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway trunk line to Altay will be nearly 500 kilometers.

Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, 11th. A railway reconnaissance team set off from here today to survey a railway line extending into the Tarim Basin to Kuqa.

This reconnaissance team will initially select the location of the branch line to the Tarim Basin railway at Daheyan, about 30 kilometers northwest of the county seat of Turpan, on the Lanzhou-Urumqi-Akto railway line, and bypass the western and southwestern edges of the Turpan Basin to select the gap through the Kala Ucheng Mountains for the railway to pass through; then they will pass through the Korla oasis and arrive at Kuqa. The entire length of this line is estimated to be 650 kilometers.

The reconnaissance will be completed before the end of September, and a preliminary survey plan for this railway line will be made based on the reconnaissance data.

Kuqa is a famous city in the Tarim Basin, rich in minerals and agricultural products such as cotton and grain. From Kuqa to the west, the terrain is flat, and there are highways to Kashgar, Shache, and other places. Along the Hotan River to the south, animal transport can reach Hotan, which is a transportation hub in the Tarim Basin.

Xinhua News Agency, Karamay, 11th. The highway from Usu via Karamay, Urho to Kashtulugai, has completed 136 kilometers of construction by the 10th and officially opened to traffic to Karamay.

The opening of this highway is of great significance to accelerating the development of various construction undertakings in the Karamay Oilfield. In addition to connecting Karamay with the highway from Urumqi to Khorgos, it guarantees the transportation of equipment, the supply of materials, and the export of crude oil. The transportation time has also been greatly shortened compared to the past.

The construction of this highway started in April last year. Although its mileage is not long, it has to pass through twelve kilometers of mud zone, fourteen kilometers of low-lying zone and one hundred kilometers of waterless zone, which has brought many difficulties to the construction of the project. But these difficulties have been overcome by the road construction troops.

To celebrate the opening of this highway, employees of the Karamay Mining Bureau and road construction troops held a ceremony on the newly built road on the afternoon of the 10th.

    铁路将穿过克拉玛依油区到阿勒泰
    伸入塔里木盆地的铁路线开始踏勘
    从乌苏到克拉玛依油区的公路正式通车
    新华社兰州11日电　铁道部第一设计院派出的一支铁路勘测队，已经踏着石油勘探人员的足迹进入克拉玛依油区。在铁路勘测队勘测过的地方，现在已经插上了一面面表示铁路线可能通过的记号的小红旗。
    铁路勘测人员决定要在短期内完成从兰新铁路上的独山子经克拉玛依到达阿勒泰的铁路草测工作，以便从几条草测比较线中决定这条铁路的线路方向，在今年年底提出设计意见书。
    从独山子到克拉玛依，据初步计算有一百六十公里长，铁路线从克拉玛依向北再经过乌尔禾石油探区以后，一直要延伸到新疆维吾尔自治区北面，附近有森林资源和地下宝藏的阿勒泰。
    连接兰新铁路干线到阿勒泰的铁路线全长将近五百公里。
    新华社乌鲁木齐11日电　一支铁路踏勘队今天从这里出发，去踏勘一条伸入塔里木盆地通到库车的铁路线。
    这支踏勘队将在吐鲁番县城西北约三十公里处的兰州——乌鲁木齐——阿克斗卡铁路线上的大河沿地方，初步选定出通向塔里木盆地铁路的岔线地点，并且绕行吐鲁番盆地的西部和西南部边缘，选择铁路通过喀拉乌成山的缺口；然后他们将经过库尔勒绿洲，到达库车。这条线路全长预计有六百五十公里。
    踏勘将在9月底以前结束，并且将根据踏勘资料作出这条铁路线的草测规划。
    库车是塔里木盆地的名城，矿藏和棉花、粮食等农产品都很丰富。从库车向西，地形平坦，有公路通喀什、莎车等地，沿和阗河向南，畜力运输可以通到和阗，是塔里木盆地交通运输的枢纽。
    新华社克拉玛依11日电　从乌苏经克拉玛依、乌尔禾到喀什吐鲁盖的公路，到十日已经有一百三十六公里修筑完成，并且正式通车到克拉玛依。
    这段公路的通车，对加速克拉玛依油区各项建设事业的发展有着重要意义。它除了使克拉玛依与乌鲁木齐到霍尔果斯的公路连接起来外，使器材运输、物资供应和原油外运等都得到了保证。在运输时间方面，也比过去大大缩短。
    这段公路是从去年4月开始修筑的，它的里程虽然不长，但中间却要经过十二公里的泥浆地带，十四公里的低洼地带和一百公里的无水区，这样给工程的修筑带来了许多困难。但这些困难都被筑路部队克服了。
    克拉玛依矿务局职工和筑路部队，为祝贺这段公路的通车，10日下午在新修的路面上举行了通车典礼。
