Speech by Comrade Wu Yuzhang, Director of the Chinese Language Reform Committee

    I fully agree with Comrade Mao Zedong's opening speech, and the reports by Comrades Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, and Deng Xiaoping. I also agree with the Central Committee's proposal for the Second Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy and the draft revision of the Party Constitution.

    Now I would like to offer some opinions to the congress on the issue of Chinese character reform.

    The language reform I am referring to is the reform of the square Chinese characters that our Han people have used for many years to write the language. Writing is only a tool for recording language, a set of symbols. Reforming the writing symbols of a language is not reforming the language itself. Therefore, language reform must not be mistaken for changing the language. Language cannot be reformed by artificial means. Moreover, the language of the Han people is one of the most developed and excellent languages in the world. It can express very rich thoughts and feelings, profound theories, the heroic history of the nation, and rich and colorful national art and literature. Even the outstanding works of Lu Xun and Comrade Mao Zedong are expressed in this language.

    “The difficulty of Chinese characters isolates the majority of the Chinese people from advanced culture forever”

    The question of Chinese language reform does not exist. The problem lies in how to reform the square Chinese characters used to write Chinese. Chinese characters have undergone many reforms in history, such as from Great Seal Script and Small Seal Script to Clerical Script, Cursive Script, and Regular Script, and so on. Although Chinese characters have undergone many reforms, they have not changed the original system of square characters. Because Chinese characters are not phonetic, they cause many difficulties in teaching, writing, and practical use. Therefore, as early as three hundred years ago, some people advocated using the Latin alphabet to spell Chinese. Sixty years ago, in the late Qing Dynasty, Lu Gan Zhang, Wang Zhao, Lao Nai Xuan and others all attempted to reform Chinese characters. After the Revolution of 1911, there emerged the movement for unified pronunciation, phonetic symbols, and the national language, the simplified Chinese character movement, the national language Romanization movement, and the Latinized New Writing movement. For decades, patriotic people from all classes and strata in China have proposed reforms of Chinese characters in order to popularize education and improve the cultural level of the Chinese people. Lu Xun was the most resolute advocate of writing reform. He once said, "The difficulty of Chinese characters isolates the majority of the Chinese people from advanced culture forever."

    We should regard language reform as an important political task

    Our Party has long attached importance to the work of writing reform. From 1922 to 1930, Comrade Qu Qiubai began to study the issue of writing reform, and in 1931, the Latinized New Writing scheme was produced. In 1940, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in "On New Democracy": "Writing must be reformed under certain conditions, and language must be close to the people." In 1941, the Latinized New Writing was used in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region to eliminate illiteracy, and achieved some success. Experiments with Latinized New Writing have been carried out in Shandong, Northeast China, and other regions, and the masses' response has been good. However, our work still has many shortcomings. We underestimated the complexity and difficulty of Chinese character reform, and, based only on subjective wishes, were eager to achieve quick results, thinking that a phonetic scheme could immediately replace Chinese characters. This idea was divorced from reality, so it failed to achieve the expected results and caused some people to doubt whether writing could be reformed.

    After liberation, China achieved an unprecedentedly unified situation, and the work of writing reform had more favorable conditions and became a more urgent task. After the broad masses of working people achieved liberation in the political and economic fields, they urgently demanded to read, to see newspapers, and to acquire knowledge and culture. Therefore, the difficulty of learning, remembering, writing, and reading Chinese characters became the main obstacle to overcoming China's cultural backwardness. Due to the difficulty of teaching Chinese characters, it takes twelve years to graduate from primary and secondary schools in China, while in the Soviet Union and many modern countries that use phonetic writing, general education generally only takes ten years. This means that every Chinese person has to spend two more years on this. The circulation of newspapers in our country is also much lower than that of the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries in proportion to the population. A large number of illiterate people in our country cannot be completely eliminated in a short period of time, and although the difficulty of Chinese characters is not the only reason, it is indeed one of the main reasons.

    Socialist construction requires a great improvement in the cultural level and technical knowledge of workers and peasants, and requires our science to reach the world's advanced level in a relatively short period of time. The improvement of science, culture, and technology has a decisive impact on the progress of China's industrialization. However, if Chinese characters are not thoroughly reformed, the Chinese people will have to spend too much time and labor on learning and using writing tools. In this way, Chinese characters will become an obstacle to advancing towards science and culture, which is not conducive to socialist construction.

    Therefore, the Party should regard language reform as an important political task and as a component of the socialist construction cause. It is wrong to take hasty and rash methods for language reform, but it is also wrong to take a passive and conservative attitude, believing that language reform is not an urgent task.

    The direction and steps of language reform

    After our country entered the socialist revolution, the Party Central Committee adopted a positive and steady advance policy for language reform. This policy is: Chinese characters must be reformed, and Chinese character reform must follow the common phonetic direction of world writing; before the realization of phoneticization, Chinese characters must be simplified to meet the current needs, and at the same time, various preparations for phoneticization must be actively carried out.

    After adopting the policy of active and steady progress, the work of language reform has made preliminary achievements in the past two or three years. First of all, the simplification of Chinese characters and the horizontal arrangement and writing of books, newspapers, and official documents have begun to be promoted throughout the country. The Chinese Character Simplification Scheme was announced by the State Council in January of this year. There are now 230 simplified Chinese characters that have been officially implemented, and 125 that have not yet been determined and are being tested in newspapers. However, the number of characters that the masses are now accustomed to using is more than this number. This work still has many shortcomings. The simplification of individual characters is not completely appropriate and should continue to be studied and improved. However, the entire Chinese character simplification work has been warmly supported by the broad masses of people.

    The work of promoting Putonghua has now begun. In 1955, the National Language Reform Conference decided to vigorously promote the common language of the Han nationality, which is Putonghua with Beijing pronunciation as the standard sound and northern dialect as the base dialect. Due to China's vast territory and inconsistent pronunciations, there are serious dialectal differences in Chinese, which is detrimental to China's socialist construction. For the further unification and development of our country's politics, economy, national defense, and culture, we must vigorously promote the teaching and use of Putonghua among the Han people. However, promoting Putonghua and unifying the language of the Han nationality is still a long-term and arduous task, and we must rely on the strength of the masses and gradually implement it according to the wishes of the masses. Now it is only the beginning.

    The Chinese phonetic scheme adopts Roman letters, that is, Latin letters, which has been determined. Because Latin letters are the letters commonly used in most modern ethnic languages, and are a type of letter that is already familiar to the Chinese intellectual community. Writing Chinese with internationally used letters is just like our adoption of the Gregorian calendar, kilometers, and kilograms, and will never damage our national culture. The Chinese Language Reform Committee published a "Chinese Phonetic Scheme (Draft)" in February this year. After discussions among people from all walks of life across the country, it has received the support and support of the vast majority of people. However, there are still some different opinions on the specific content of the alphabet, which are still being discussed and studied, and the final revision will be made and announced by the government soon. At present, the main uses of the phonetic scheme are to annotate Chinese characters and to use it as a tool for teaching Putonghua, and at the same time to use it to carry out experimental work on phonetic writing.

    The question of abolishing Chinese characters does not exist

    Having a phonetic scheme does not mean that we have a phonetic writing. Because to change Chinese characters into phonetic writing, it is not enough to have a set of letters, we must solve the rules for connecting words, how to distinguish homophones, the problem of word standardization, and how to spell classical Chinese components and foreign words in Chinese, etc. The solution of these problems requires very complex and meticulous research and experimentation. We must concentrate the strength of the country's linguistic scientists to do this well. When this work is done well, we can be considered to have a new phonetic writing. However, this new phonetic writing still needs to be tested, learned, and used among the masses before it can be gradually promoted. It is conceivable that this cannot be done in three or five years, but there must be a transition period. During the transition period, Chinese characters must continue to be used, which is beyond doubt. At that time, various books and periodicals can use Chinese characters alone, or they can use Chinese characters and phonetic writing in parallel, or they can be printed in two language versions, so that people who already know Chinese characters can easily learn phonetic writing. Even after phonetic writing is promoted throughout the country, Chinese characters will still be taught in secondary schools or universities in order to study ancient Chinese classics, and a large number of people in society will still read and write Chinese characters. Therefore, the question of whether Chinese characters should be abolished does not exist. People who generally learn Chinese characters hear about language reform and think that Chinese characters are going to be abolished and that they are going to become illiterate. Some people also think that language reform will make it impossible to preserve our country's rich national cultural heritage. All these ideas are completely unnecessary worries.

    Overcome subjectivism and avoid rash advances or passive wait-and-see

    That is what I wanted to explain about the work of language reform. The Central Committee's proposal for the Second Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy has included "promoting language reform in a planned and step-by-step manner," and I fully agree. It should be understood that this work is very important and very difficult. The work of language reform is closely related to the current and long-term interests of the vast majority of people in the country. The purpose of our work is to solve the difficulties for the broad masses of working people who urgently need cultural knowledge, and at the same time, we must take into account the habits and thoughts and feelings of Chinese intellectuals on the use of old writing. Therefore, in this work, just like in all revolutionary work, only by resolutely overcoming subjectivism can we avoid making mistakes or making fewer mistakes in our work. In this work, we must not only avoid rash advances, but also never passively wait and see; we must rely on the wisdom and strength of the masses, but also listen to the opinions of experts and scholars as much as possible. I earnestly hope that all our comrades in the Party, under the leadership of the Central Committee, will work together with the people of the whole country to complete this great undertaking that our predecessors failed to complete.

### 关于中国文字改革的问题

    关于中国文字改革的问题
    中国文字改革委员会主任　吴玉章同志的发言
    我完全同意毛泽东同志的开幕词，刘少奇同志、周恩来同志和邓小平同志的报告。对于中央关于发展国民经济的第二个五年计划的建议和党章修改草案我都同意。
    现在我想就中国文字改革问题，向大会提供一点意见。
    我要说的文字改革，是指我国汉民族许多年来用以书写语言的那种方块汉字的改革。文字只是记录语言的一种工具，一套符号，改革语言的书写符号并不是改革语言本身，因此决不能把文字改革误会为要改变语言。语言是不能用人为的方法加以改革的。并且，汉民族的语言是世界上最发达最优秀的语言之一，它能够表达出十分丰富的思想感情，博大精深的学说理论，英勇奋斗的民族历史，丰富多采的民族文艺，以至鲁迅和毛泽东同志的杰出的著作，都是用这种语言来表达的。
    “汉字的艰深使全中国大多数的人民，永远和前进的文化隔离”
    汉语改革这样的问题并不存在。问题是在于如何改革书写汉语的方块汉字。汉字在历史上经过了许多次的改革，如从大篆、小篆到隶书、草书和楷书等等。汉字尽管已经进行了许多次改革，但是还没有改变原来方块字的体系；由于汉字不是拼音文字，在教学、书写以及实用方面，造成了许多困难。因此，早在三百多年以前，就有人主张用拉丁字母拼写汉语。六十年前，当清朝末年，卢戆章、王照、劳乃宣等都作过改革汉字的尝试。辛亥革命以后，产生了读音统一、注音字母和国语运动，汉字简化运动，国语罗马字运动，一直到拉丁化新文字运动。几十年来，中国各阶级各阶层的爱国人士，为了普及教育和提高我国人民的文化水平，都提出过改革汉字的主张。鲁迅是最坚决主张文字改革的，他曾经说过：“汉字的艰深使全中国大多数的人民，永远和前进的文化隔离”。
    应当把文字改革当作一项重要的政治任务
    我们党很早就重视文字改革的工作。从一九二二到一九三○年瞿秋白同志就着手研究文字改革问题，一九三一年产生了拉丁化新文字方案。一九四○年毛泽东同志在“新民主主义论”里曾经指出：“文字必须在一定条件下加以改革，言语必须接近民众”。一九四一年在陕甘宁边区曾经试用拉丁化新文字扫除文盲，获得了一定的成绩。在山东、东北和其他一些地区都作过拉丁化新文字的试验，群众的反映是良好的。但是我们的工作仍然有不少缺点。我们对于汉字改革工作的复杂性和艰巨性估计不足，只凭主观愿望，急于求成，以为有了拼音方案就可以立即代替汉字。这种想法是脱离实际的，因此没有能够收到预期的效果，并且使一部分群众对于文字能否改革，引起了怀疑。
    解放以后，我国实现了前所未有的统一的局面，文字改革工作具备了更加有利的条件，同时也成为一项更加迫切的任务。广大的劳动人民在政治和经济方面得到了翻身以后，十分迫切地要求读书、看报，要求知识和文化。因此汉字的难学、难记、难写、难读成为克服我国文化落后状态的主要障碍。由于汉字教学的困难，我国中小学普通教育需要十二年才能毕业，而苏联和现代许多采用拼音文字的国家的普通教育一般只要十年，这就是说，每一个中国人都要在这上面多化费两年时间。我国报纸的销数按照人口比例来说，也比苏联和其他人民民主国家少得多。我国大量的文盲还不能在短时期内完全扫除，汉字的艰难虽然不是唯一原因，但确实是主要的原因之一。
    社会主义建设要求大大提高工人农民的文化水平和技术知识，要求我国科学，在一个比较短的时期内达到世界的先进水平。科学、文化、技术的提高，对于我国工业化的进展，具有决定性的作用。但是如果汉字不加以彻底的改革，中国人民就必须在学习和使用文字工具上面，耗费掉过多的时间和劳动力，这样，汉字将成为向科学和文化进军的一重障碍，对于社会主义建设是不利的。
    因此，党应当把文字改革当作一项重要的政治任务，当作社会主义建设事业的一个组成部分。对于文字改革采取急躁冒进的办法是不对的，但是采取消极保守的态度，认为文字改革是不急之务，也是错误的。
    文字改革的方针和步骤
    我国进入社会主义革命之后，党中央对于文字改革采取了积极的稳步前进的方针。这个方针是：汉字必须改革，汉字改革要走世界文字共同的拼音方向；在实现拼音化以前，必须简化汉字，以应目前的需要，同时积极进行拼音化的各项准备工作。
    采取了积极的稳步前进的方针以后，这二、三年来文字改革工作已经有了初步的成就。首先是汉字简化和书报公文的横排横写，已经在全国开始推行。汉字简化方案已于今年一月由国务院公布，现在已经正式推行的简化汉字有二百三十个，在报纸上试用还没有确定的有一百二十五个。但是群众现在习惯使用的，却不止这个数目。这一项工作，还有不少缺点，个别的字简化得不完全恰当，应当继续研究改善。但是整个汉字简化工作是受到广大的人民群众热烈拥护的。
    推广普通话的工作现在已经开始。一九五五年全国文字改革会议决定大力推广汉民族共同语，这就是以北京语音为标准音，以北方话为基础方言的普通话。由于我国地域辽阔，读音不统一，汉语存在严重的方言分歧，这是对于我国社会主义建设事业不利的。为了我国政治、经济、国防和文化的进一步统一和发展，我们必须在汉民族中大力推广普通话的教学和使用。但是推广普通话，统一汉民族语言，仍然是长期的艰巨的工作，并且要依靠群众的力量，根据群众的志愿，逐步推行，现在还不过是开端。
    汉语拼音方案，采用罗马字母，即拉丁字母，这是确定了的。因为拉丁字母是现代大多数的民族语言中所公用的字母，并且是为我国知识界所已经熟悉的一种字母。用国际通用的字母书写汉语，正像我们采取公历、公里、公斤一样，决不会损害我们的民族文化。中国文字改革委员会今年二月发表了一个“汉语拼音方案（草案）”，经过全国各方面人士的讨论，获得绝大多数人士的支持和拥护。但是对于字母表的具体内容，还有一些不同的意见，还在继续讨论和研究，不久就可以作出最后的修订，由政府公布。拼音方案，在目前主要的用途，是为了给汉字注音和用作教学普通话的工具，同时用以进行拼音文字的试验工作。
    汉字废除的问题是不存在的
    我们有了拼音方案，并不就等于有了拼音文字。因为要把汉字改成拼音文字，光是有了一套字母还不行，一定要解决词的连写规则，同音字如何区别的问题，词的定型化问题，汉语中间的文言成分和外来语如何拼写的问题等等。这些问题的解决，需要十分复杂的细致的研究和试验工作，要集中全国语言科学者的力量，才能够做好。这些工作做好了，我们才算有了一种拼音新文字，但是这种拼音新文字，仍然要在群众中间，经过试教、试学、试用，然后逐步推行。可想而知，这样就不是三年五年就可以做到，而要有一个过渡时期。在过渡时期中，汉字仍然要继续使用，这是毫无疑问的。那个时候，各种书刊可以单独使用汉字，也可以用汉字和拼音文字对照，或者分别印成两种文字的版本，使得已识汉字的人容易学会拼音文字。即使拼音文字在全国推行之后，为了研究我国古代典籍，汉字仍然要在中等学校或者高等学校内继续教学，社会上仍然会有一大部分人阅读和书写汉字。因此汉字要不要废除的问题是不存在的。一般学会汉字的，听到了文字改革，就以为要废除汉字了，自己要变成文盲了。还有些人以为文字改革将使我国丰富的民族文化遗产无法保存下来。这种种想法完全是不必要的过虑。
    克服主观主义，避免急躁冒进或消极观望
    关于文字改革工作，我所要说明的，就是这些。中央关于发展国民经济的第二个五年计划的建议中，已经列入“有计划有步骤地推行文字改革”这一项，我完全赞成。应当明白，这一项工作是十分重要的，也是十分艰巨的。文字改革工作，是和全国极大多数人民的目前利益和长远利益密切相关的。我们工作的目的是为了替迫切需要文化知识的广大劳动群众解决困难，同时也不能不照顾到中国知识分子对旧文字的使用习惯和思想情感。因此，在这一项工作中，也正像在一切革命工作中一样，只有坚决地克服主观主义，才能使我们在工作中不犯错误或少犯错误。在这一项工作中，既要避免急躁冒进，也决不能消极观望；要依靠群众的智慧和力量，但也要尽量听取专家学者们的意见。我迫切地期望我们全党同志在中央领导之下，和全国人民一道，共同努力，完成我们前人所未能完成的这一项伟大事业。
