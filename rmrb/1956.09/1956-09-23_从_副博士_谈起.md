Starting from the "Associate Doctor"
He Ju

Recently, various research institutions and universities have been recruiting graduate students, which is exciting.

The title of "Associate Doctor" before graduate student is even more exciting for young people, but the problem lies here.

It is said that this is learning from the Soviet Union, because in the Soviet Union, graduate students graduate as "Associate Doctors," or translated as "Candidate of Sciences," in short, it is related to a doctorate. In fact, Soviet graduate students only get the title "Кандидаг" (Kandidat), meaning that they are qualified to apply for the doctoral dissertation defense to obtain a doctorate. Before they intend to or can present a dissertation, it has nothing to do with a doctorate at all. Obviously, an associate professor *is* a professor, and an associate researcher *is* a researcher, but the so-called "Associate Doctor" is definitely *not* a doctor. Just as a lecturer can hope to become a professor but cannot be called an associate professor. At this beginning of marching towards science, we should seriously treat academic titles; otherwise, the name does not match the reality, which makes young friends a little elated, and inevitably causes ideological confusion.

How did the term "Associate Doctor" come about? Russian-Chinese dictionaries clearly translate this word as "Master," but our talented translators insist on demonstrating their creativity; therefore, they follow suit without in-depth investigation and shout it out indiscriminately. Recently, the Chinese Academy of Sciences has canceled this title in its announcements, but it is still preserved on other occasions. I advise translators to first understand the original meaning of a word, otherwise spreading errors will harm people greatly; "Associate Doctor" is one example, "Seminar" is one example, "Jurisdiction" is one example, and "Corresponding Academician" is another example. I think "Corresponding Academician" is quite incomprehensible; translating it as "Deputy Academician" might be more appropriate, because he does not complete the task of an academician by means of correspondence.

Translators who interpret words literally often help dogmatists create mistakes. In learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, in addition to combining it with China's specific conditions, there is also an important condition, which is to thoroughly understand the specific content of the advanced experience of the Soviet Union first. Dogmatists are lazy people who are unwilling to thoroughly understand the content and issue orders based solely on the one-sided words of "genius" translators. This approach has caused us a lot of suffering in the teaching reform work. It seems that we have not suffered enough, and another wave of "Associate Doctors" has arrived. As for the specifications of graduate students, the methods of cultivation, what conditions should be met, and other basic issues, we are still very vague. These basic problems must be solved first, and even if specific methods cannot be put forward, there should be principled decisions; otherwise, everyone has their own standards, and the name of "Associate Doctor" cannot save the consequences of indiscriminately recruiting graduate students. When a certain school held a graduate student graduation examination, after the defense, the external reviewers asked what the standards were when voting. From the director of studies down, everyone was stunned and did not know how to answer. As a result, it ended without resolution. It is not very optimistic whether the future will be bright when training scientific cadres with this kind of unserious attitude. In order to correct the error of neglecting the fundamental and pursuing the incidental, I would like to recommend the article "On the Training of Scientific Cadres" published in the "Pravda" on August 29 for reference, which emphasizes that attention must be paid to the specifications of graduate students and the conditions that graduate students should possess.

Graduate students study hard for several years and achieve results, and they should get a degree. It can be called a Master, or it can be called something else. I think a Master is still appropriate, assuming no one says I am conservative. No matter what it is called, it should first be stipulated in the regulations and need not be marked on the enrollment advertisement; if it is said that a university graduate can obtain a bachelor's degree, will there also be a "×× University Recruiting Bachelor Degree Students Announcement"? Especially marking the Associate Doctor on the enrollment advertisement, in addition to some appeal, I can't see any other meaning.

Tuition of fifty yuan, the title of Associate Doctor, in addition to the academic title being worth discussing, it should be considered an encouragement. However, it encourages the graduate students who will be admitted in the future, but forgets the graduate students who have already been admitted. What is the reason, and it is incomprehensible. There are many good graduate students currently in school, and the objective conditions are exactly the same as those of the graduate students who will be admitted in the future. However, they may not have the academic title, and the scholarship is only twenty-six yuan, which is not even enough to buy a good dictionary. In contrast, they can only blame themselves for studying one or two years earlier. As a person who is undertaking the work of training graduate students, I cannot find any reason for the differential treatment that should be given here; on the contrary, we have sufficient reasons to believe that this differential treatment is unfair and will produce adverse consequences. I hope the relevant authorities can consider it.

### 从“副博士”谈起

    从“副博士”谈起
    何居
    近来各研究机关和高等学校都在招收研究生，这是令人兴奋的事。
    研究生之前冠以“副博士”，更令青年人兴奋，然而问题也就在这里。
    据说这是学习苏联，因为在苏联，研究生毕业就是副博士，或译“候补博士”，总之，是与博士有关。其实，苏联研究生毕业只称“堪及达”（Кандидаг），意思是说，是一位有资格提出博士论文申请考试来取得博士学位的人，当他不打算或不能提出论文以前，与博士根本无关。很显然，副教授是教授，副研究员是研究员，然而所谓“副博士”决不是博士。正如讲师可望做教授，然而不能称之为副教授。在这开始向科学进军的时候，似应严肃对待学衔名称；否则名不副实，弄得年轻朋友有些飘飘然，难免造成思想上的混乱。
    副博士一辞是怎么来的？俄华字典上明明把这个字译成“硕士”，而我们的天才翻译家偏偏要发挥其创造性；于是相率不加深究，跟着乱喊。最近科学院的启事上已把这个名称取消了，但在其他场合仍保存了它。奉劝翻译家先要把一个字的原义弄清楚，否则以讹传讹，害人不浅；“副博士”是一例，“习明纳尔”是一例，“法权”是一例，……而“通信院士”又是一例。我觉得“通信院士”是颇费解的，译成“副院士”或者更切合些，因为他并不是凭通信方式来完成院士任务的。
    望文生义的翻译家往往会助长教条主义者制造错误。学习苏联先进经验除须结合中国具体情况而外，还有一个重要条件，就是先要彻底了解苏联先进经验的具体内容。教条主义者是懒汉，不愿彻底了解内容而只凭“天才”翻译家的一面之辞就发布命令，这种作法使我们在教学改革工作中吃了不少苦头。似乎苦头吃得还不够，又来热闹一阵“副博士”，至于研究生的规格如何、培养方法如何、应具备什么条件等基本问题，至今却很茫然。这些基本问题必须首先解决，即使提不出具体办法也该有原则性的决定；否则各有尺寸，五花八门，副博士之名也会挽救不了滥收研究生的后果。某校在举行研究生毕业考试时，经过答辩以后，校外评阅员在投票时询问有什么标准，自教务长以下都膛目不知所对，结果不了了之；用这种不严肃的态度来培养科学干部，前途未必是很乐观的。为了改正舍本逐末的错误，我愿推荐8月29日“真理报”上所载“论科学干部的培养”一文以供参考，其中着重指出了培养研究生必须注意研究生的规格和培养研究生所应具备的条件。
    研究生苦学了几年，有了成绩，应当得个学位。可以叫它硕士，也不妨叫它别的什么。我想，硕士还是合式的，假使没有人说我保守的话。不管叫什么，首先应当在规程中规定，不必在招生广告上标明；假使说大学毕业即可取得学士学位，是否也会有“××大学招收学士大学生启事”呢？特别在招生广告上标明副博士，除了有些吸引力以外，看不出其他什么意义。
    膏火五十元，头衔副博士，除了学衔名称值得商议以外，应当认为这是一种鼓励。可是，鼓励了今后入学的研究生，忘却了已经入学的研究生，道理何在，殊不可解。现在在校的研究生有许多是很好的，客观条件则和今后入学的研究生所具备的也完全一样，然而学衔未必有，助学金只有二十六元，连买本好字典的钱也剩不了，相形之下，只有自怨不该早学一两年而已。作为一个正在担负培养研究生工作的人，我在这里找不到丝毫应有差别待遇的理由；反之，我们有足够的理由认为这种差别待遇是不公道的，同时会产生不良的后果。希望有关机关能考虑一下。
