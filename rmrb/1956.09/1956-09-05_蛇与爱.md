Title: Snake and Love

    Speaking of animals, I don't know what others think, but I find snakes very scary. Caterpillars are already scary, but compared to caterpillars, snakes are smooth, long, and much scarier to me. I love things with legs; I love things with horns; I love things with fins; I love things with wings. But I don't love snakes. They stay in gloomy places and suddenly dart out, jumping far away. It would be one thing if they just bit me, but if they wrapped around my body, that would be terrible. Many people don't eat eels, and I understand their psychology; it's not because they love them, but because they fear them. Old people in the countryside used to be afraid of snakes because they didn't know whether it was better to kill them or release them. If released, they might harm people; if killed, the gods might not approve. Some religions simply worship snakes as gods, while others assign the form of a snake to demons. The same creature, treated in two different ways, is truly terrifying.

    Of course, I'm afraid of animals that eat me, like lions and tigers. I'm also somewhat afraid of animals that bite me, like mosquitoes and flies. However, this kind of fear is not exactly the same as the fear of snakes. Perhaps the power of lions and mosquitoes combined would be a little bit like the spiritual power that snakes have over me. I only say "a little bit," because here the physical form of the snake is missing. When a snake becomes a demon, like the giant python in "Journey to the West," even Sun Wukong is helpless.

    What if it were Bai Niangzi from "Legend of the White Snake" – charming, beautiful, passionate, and righteous?

    I would have no reason not to love her; Xu Xian would have no reason not to love her. Is there any man in the world who doesn't love women?

    The problem is that he doesn't know she's a snake spirit. But as luck would have it, she gets drunk during the Dragon Boat Festival and reveals her true form.

    And you are just an ordinary person, an average person who has lived with the fear of snakes in legends for even longer. What do you do when you see a beauty as fair as a flower suddenly turn into a giant python lying across your bed? What should Xu Xian do?

    Fear and love. Both fear and love. Not the fear of a wife: fear here is actually love. I'm talking about real fear, life-threatening fear.

    Xu Xian just happened to love Bai Niangzi during the time he didn't know she was a snake! He loved her! Even after he found out, when he looked back, he couldn't sever the ties, the sweet taste still湧ed in his heart. Who doesn't love a beautiful woman? Who doesn't love a beautiful woman who is devoted to them? Heavens! How could you be a snake, a snake spirit! When I hide from you, I am loving you. When you chase after me, I fear you. And, heavens! You spare no effort to love me, even though you are a snake, a snake spirit. You are what Fahai calls a "monstrous creature." But you would rather die than love me, love only me. How can I not love you within my fear of you? I am a person without a home or a job, without fame or position, and not even a handsome man. What makes you love me so much? Only me?

    Great spirit who created this terrifying and beautiful legend, are you intentionally testing yourself, testing us, this group of Xu Xians? What kind of test have you given us men! A beautiful woman who was originally a snake, and yet so passionate! And yet dared to compete with the gods! Here is the most terrible and the most lovable.

    Bai Niangzi, you are great, your unwavering love is great. You move people. But you are a snake. Since ancient times, snakes have been feared by mankind, and that is your tragedy. You don't blame Xu Xian. You know you are a snake, yet you fell in love with someone who fears snakes. You resent heaven, you resent heaven for giving you such a fiery heart, but inside the body of a terrible snake? When you can't resent anymore, you resent the timid Xu Xian, you resent the timid humans, you resent the ruthless Fahai, you resent the gods for not helping you but helping humans, you resent everything, you resent yourself. Bai Niangzi, how pitifully you cry! How primitive and profound is your protest!

    Poets write of your suffering, your unanswerable questions. The poet has a mind that peers into the mysteries of the universe, as ancient as the universe itself. This requires childlike innocence. This requires the language of poetry. This requires putting symbolic techniques and class analysis aside for the moment. Goethe, you are also a modern man, how did you write your "Faust"? And Pu Songling, who speaks of fox spirits and ghosts, how are your little stories of people and nature so moving? Let us remove the intellectual air from the beautiful ancient legends and wholeheartedly praise man and nature.

    蛇与爱
    丁一万
    动物里头，不知道别人怎么样想，我觉得蛇是很可怕的。毛毛虫已经可怕了，但是比起毛毛虫来，光溜溜的，长悠悠的，对我来说，蛇是可怕多了。我爱有腿的；我爱有角的；我爱有鳍的；我爱有翅的。可是我不爱蛇。它呆在阴森地方，冷不防窜了出来，一跳老远，咬我一口也还罢了，万一裹住我的身子，那就糟了。许多人不吃鳝鱼，我明白他们的心理，不是为了爱它，而是由于怕它。旧时乡间老人大都怕蛇，因为不知道弄死的好，还是放生的好。放生的话，怕它害人；弄死的话，又怕神不答应。有的宗教索性就拜蛇为神，有的宗教索性就把蛇的形体给了恶魔。一样东西，两样待遇，真是可怕之至。
    吃我的动物，当然我怕，例如狮子、老虎。叮我的动物，我也有些怕，例如蚊子、苍蝇。不过这种畏惧心理又和怕蛇心理不完全一样。也许狮子和蚊子加在一道，才有一点蛇对我的精神的威力罢。我只说“有一点”，因为这里少了蛇的形体。蛇成了妖，像“西游记”里面的巨蟒，孙行者也束手无策了。
    如果它是“雷峰塔传奇”里面的白娘娘，千娇百媚，多情多义，该怎么办呢？
    我没有理由不爱她；许仙没有理由不爱她。世上岂有男人而不爱女人的吗？
    问题在他不知道她是蛇精。可是事有凑巧，她在端午节喝醉了酒，显了原形。
    而你只是一个普通人、一个长久活在怕蛇的更长久的传说之中的寻常人，看见如花似玉的美人忽然变成巨蟒，横在床头，又怎么办呢？许仙该怎么办呢？
    怕和爱。又怕又爱。不是怕老婆的怕：怕在这里其实就是爱。我说的是真正的怕，性命休矣的怕。
    偏偏许仙在不知道白娘娘是蛇的期间爱她！爱过她！即使是在知道了以后，回想起来，斩不断，理还乱，那股甜滋味依然涌在心头。有谁不爱美妇人？谁又不爱一心向着自己的美妇人？天呀！怎么你会是蛇、蛇精！躲你，躲你的时候，我在爱你。你追赶前来，我，我又怕你。而且，天呀！你不惜一切来爱我，虽然你是蛇、蛇精。你是法海所谓的“孽畜”。可是你宁死也要爱我、爱我一个人。我怎么能不在怕你之中又爱你？我这个人无家无业，无名无位，又非美男子，是什么让你这样爱我？单只爱我一个人？
    创造这可怕而又美丽的传说的巨灵，你是有心考验自己、考验我们这群许仙？你给了我们男子一个什么样的考验啊！一个原本是蛇的美妇人，偏又多情！偏又敢于和天神比并！这里是最可怕和最可爱。
    白娘娘，你是伟大的，你的执着的爱是伟大的。你感动人。然而你是蛇。自古以来，人类害怕的蛇，这就是你的悲剧。你不怨许仙。你知道自己是蛇，偏又爱上了怕蛇的人。你怨天，你怨天给了你那么一颗火热的心，却在一个可怕的蛇的身子里面？怨到怨不得的时候，你怨胆小的许仙，你怨胆小的人类，你怨狠心的法海，你怨天神不帮你而帮人类，你怨一切，你怨自己。白娘娘，你哭的多可怜啊！你的抗议是多原始而又深沉啊！
    诗人写下你的苦难、你的谁也解答不了的疑问。诗人有一个窥宇宙之迷、和宇宙一般古老的心灵。这需要童心。这需要诗的语言。这需要把象征手法和阶级分析暂且放在一旁。哥德，你也是现代人，你怎么会写成了你的“浮士德”的？还有说狐道鬼的蒲留仙，你那些人与自然的小故事，怎么会那样娓娓动人？让我们从美丽的古老的传说里面去掉知识分子气息，尽情讴歌人与自然。
