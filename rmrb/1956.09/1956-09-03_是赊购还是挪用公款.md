    Is it Credit Purchase or Misappropriation of Public Funds
    I am a cadre of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications. One day, while I was working in the office, the union group leader ran in breathlessly to tell everyone some urgent "good" news. It turned out that our grassroots union of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications had decided to organize everyone for credit purchases. The items available for credit purchase were specified as alarm clocks, seventeen-jewel watches, and radio receivers. The funds would be temporarily advanced by the administration, totaling 10,000 yuan, to be deducted in nine monthly installments from our salaries. The procedure for credit purchase was to obtain goods with a union introduction letter. As a result, this "good" news transformed the atmosphere in the office, and people stopped working to start discussing the credit purchases. Some said that the range of items was too limited and demanded a wider selection; some said that the registration deadline was too tight and needed to be discussed with their spouses; some worried that a lump-sum deduction would be unbearable if their job changed; and some believed that using public funds to buy personal items violated financial discipline and suggested careful consideration. The discussions were diverse and inconclusive, only stopping when it was time to go home for dinner.
    The union, instead of carefully considering everyone's opinions, explained that the 10,000 yuan had already been received, the items had been decided, and there was no need to reconsider. They then issued purchase introduction letters, requesting that people pick up the goods that evening or the next day. As a result, more than 400 people registered, accounting for about one-third of the total number of employees. However, after only 200 people had picked up their items, the value of the goods had already reached 17,000 yuan, exceeding the budget by 7,000 yuan, and the remaining 200 or so people had not yet made their purchases. The union estimated that if they continued to issue introduction letters, they might need another 30,000 yuan. What to do? So, on the one hand, they asked the administration to borrow an additional 7,000 yuan to cover the shortfall for the goods already taken; on the other hand, they notified the union group leaders to hold a meeting, mobilizing those seeking credit purchases to stop.
    Do comrades need such "care" from the union? The facts can illustrate this. The wage supplements issued from April to July, according to the wage standards, were only distributed for half a month before the comrades, based on their personal financial capabilities and needs, properly managed the money. Many people deposited the money in the bank. But now the union is handling advance payment credit purchases, so some people gave their own watches to others and bought new ones; some bought items to send home; the most common thing was to deposit their own money in the bank to earn interest while enjoying the "care," including quite a few responsible cadres of the units.
    I think the opinion expressed in the short article "Not Everyone Gets Eighty Yuan" on page 2 of the People's Daily on July 24, regarding the phenomenon of blindly pre-paying wage supplements and spending money recklessly, is correct. But the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications is doing something else, vigorously pursuing advance payment credit purchases of items that are not essential to life, increasing the burden on employees, and such long-term misappropriation of public funds violates national financial discipline. 17,000 yuan is not a small amount, and the leadership of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications should not ignore this matter, and many people with savings should not take advantage of this. I suggest that the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications investigate and correctly handle this matter. Wang Pei

### 是赊购还是挪用公款

    是赊购还是挪用公款
    我是邮电部的干部。一天，正在办公，工会小组长气喘吁吁地跑来告诉大家一件紧急“喜”事。原来我们邮电部基层工会决定组织大家赊购。赊购物品规定为闹钟、十七钻手表和无线电收音机，款项由行政暂垫一万元，分九个月在发薪时扣清。赊购的手续是凭工会介绍信取货。于是，这件“喜”事转变了办公室里的空气，人们停下工作作起赊购文章来。有的说品种规定的太少，要求放宽选购范围；有的说登记时间限制太紧，需要与爱人商量；有的顾虑工作变动时一次扣清受不了；也有认为挪用公款私人买东西违犯财政纪律，建议慎重考虑。议论纷纷，莫衷一是，直到下班吃饭时才停止。
    工会听了大家的意见不但不好好考虑，反而解释说：一万元已领到手，品种已经决定，不用再考虑了。随即发了购货介绍信，要求晚上或第二天就去取货。结果登记的有四百多人，约占职工总数三分之一。但其中两百人取到东西后，货价已达到一万七千元，超支七千元，其余两百来人还没有买到。工会估计如果继续再发介绍信，可能还需三万元。怎么办呢？于是一方面又向行政上要求补借了已经取货的缺额七千多元，另一方面通知各工会小组长开会，动员要求赊购者停止赊购。
    同志们是不是需要工会这样“照顾”呢？可以用事实来说明，4月份至7月份按工资标准补发的工资，发下去刚刚半个月，同志们都根据个人经济能力和需要，正确地支配了这批钱，许多人把钱存入银行。可是现在工会又来办理垫款赊货了，于是有的把自己的手表给了别人，另买新的；有的买来寄回家去；最普遍的是一方面把自己的钱存在银行里生息，一方面来享受“照顾”，其中还包括不少单位的负责干部。
    我认为7月24日人民日报第二版那篇短文“并非人人八十元”对盲目预支补发工资的乱花钱现象，提出的意见是对的。但是邮电部却在做着另一件事，大干其垫款赊购并非生活十分需要的用品，增加职工的负担，而且这样长期挪用公款是违犯国家财政纪律的行为。一万七千元并不是一个小数目，邮电部领导上不应该不注意这件事情，许多有存款的人也不应该占这种便宜。我建议邮电部检查并正确处理这件事情。　王沛
