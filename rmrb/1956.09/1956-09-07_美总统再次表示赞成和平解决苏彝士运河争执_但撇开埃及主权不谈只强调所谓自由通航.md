Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 6th: At a press conference held by U.S. President Eisenhower on September 5th, a reporter asked him whether the United States would support Britain and France if they insisted that Egypt must accept the West's proposals regarding the Suez Canal issue.

In answering this question, Eisenhower merely said that he was unwilling to comment on the content of the Western proposals while they were being discussed in Cairo. Eisenhower had stated last week that the conditions put forward by the West were indispensable to resolving the Suez Canal issue.

The US President once again stated that the United States favored a peaceful resolution of the Suez Canal dispute. However, he ignored Egyptian sovereignty and only emphasized that "free navigation" of the Suez Canal in peacetime and wartime must be guaranteed in accordance with the 1888 treaty.

When talking about the Democratic Party's attacks on the Republican government for "losing the Cold War," Eisenhower tried his best to promote the Republican government's "achievements." He boasted that the coup launched by the United States in Guatemala had "repelled Communism there." He boasted that the Western-instigated coup in Iran had "resolved" the problem of Iran "falling into" the hands of its People's Party. When talking about the situation in Indochina, he emphasized that the "free world" had gained a "solid foothold" in South Vietnam. Eisenhower also counted the Korean armistice and the restoration of Austrian unification as merits of the Republican government. However, he also admitted that "the Korean War was fought under conditions where (the United States) could not win," and said: "We fought and suffered losses, just to maintain the front we occupied at that time."

Someone raised the question of Democratic Senator Mansfield's statement last week that the time for holding another summit meeting of the great powers was "here or approaching." Eisenhower replied that he did not see "what benefit" would be gained from holding such a meeting. He reiterated some of the one-sided demands made by the United States, including holding so-called "free elections" in the East European People's Democratic countries. He stated that peace would only be guaranteed if the United States' demands were met.

In answering questions, Eisenhower mentioned that it would probably be impossible for Indian Prime Minister Nehru to visit the United States before the U.S. presidential election in November.

    美总统再次表示赞成和平解决苏彝士运河争执
    但撇开埃及主权不谈只强调所谓自由通航
    新华社6日讯　华盛顿消息：在美国总统艾森豪威尔9月5日举行的记者招待会上，有记者问他如果英国和法国坚持埃及非接受西方关于苏彝士运河问题的建议不可的话，美国是否将支持英法。
    艾森豪威尔在回答这个问题的时候只是说，当西方建议正在开罗被讨论的时候，他不愿意对它的内容发表意见。艾森豪威尔在上星期曾经表示西方提出的条件是解决苏彝士运河问题不可缺少的。
    这位美国总统再一次表示美国赞成和平解决苏彝士运河争执。可是，他撇开埃及的主权不谈，只是强调必须根据1888年的条约保证苏彝士运河在和平时期和战争时期的“自由通航”。
    艾森豪威尔在谈到民主党攻击共和党政府“在冷战中打输了”这一点的时候，竭力宣扬共和党政府的“成就”。他吹嘘美国在危地马拉发动的政变使“共产主义在那里被打退了”。他夸耀西方煽动的伊朗的政变“解决了”伊朗要“沦于”本国的人民党之手的问题。他在谈到印度支那局势的时候强调说，“自由世界”在越南南部取得了一个“坚固的立足点”。艾森豪威尔还把朝鲜停战和奥地利恢复统一也算作共和党政府的功劳。可是，他也承认，“朝鲜战争是在（美国）不可能胜利的情况下进行的”，他说：“我们进行战斗，遭受损失，仅仅是为了保持我们那时占有的阵线”。
    有人就民主党参议员曼斯菲尔德上个星期所说的举行另一次大国政府首脑会议的时机“已经来到了或者已经接近了”这件事提出问题，艾森豪威尔回答说，他看不出举行这样一次会议“会获得什么好处”。他重申美国提出过的一些片面的要求，其中包括在东欧人民民主国家举行他所谓的“自由选举”，他表示只有满足了美国的这些要求，和平才会有保证。
    艾森豪威尔在回答问题时谈到，在11月美国总统选举以前，印度总理尼赫鲁大概不可能访问美国。
