    "Clever" Thief

    There was a thief who was discovered. Seeing people shouting "Catch the thief!" from all sides, he hurriedly mingled with the crowd, randomly pointed his finger, and joined in the shouting, "Catch the thief! Catch the thief!"

    Perhaps because this story is so widely circulated, there are still people who take this thief as their role model. This person is the French Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Fouchet. According to Reuters, Fouchet said in a speech in Gourdon, France, at the end of August: "If Egypt refuses to consider the principles observed by the London Conference, it proves that it does not harbor a spirit of international cooperation, but mainly imperialist aims."

    The "principles observed by the London Conference" that Fouchet refers to naturally refer to the "internationalization" principle embodied in the Dulles Plan. However, the Dulles principle was not the only principle proposed at the London Conference to solve the Suez Canal issue. Existing alongside it were the plans of the Soviet Union, India, Indonesia, and Ceylon, which advocated full respect for Egyptian sovereignty. And the participating countries unanimously agreed to send all recorded materials to the Egyptian government so that the Egyptian government could make full and free consideration. Fouchet describing the Dulles principle as "the principle observed by the London Conference" is the first trick learned from that "clever" thief: "mingling with the crowd" to confuse people.

    After mingling with the crowd, this "clever" thief began to shout "Catch the thief!" In Fouchet's words, he loudly accused Egypt of being "imperialist." Since Egypt is "imperialist" and has been angrily denounced by Fouchet, it is immediately clear that the government Fouchet represents is naturally not among the imperialist ranks.

    However, is it Egyptian troops that have concentrated in Cyprus? Is it Egyptian warships that have sailed to the port of Marseille? No, on the contrary, it is France that is carrying out military threats against Egypt, and the purpose is to get Egypt to agree to "internationalize" a part of its own territory.

    Fouchet may think he is very clever, but, just like that "clever" thief, people finally discovered that the person shouting "Catch the thief!" was actually the thief himself. Although Mr. Fouchet wanted to take the "imperialist" label off his own head and put it on Egypt's, his imperialist nature was already exposed while he was in the process of taking it off. (Ding)

### “聪明”的贼

    “聪明”的贼
    有一个贼，被人发现了。他看见四面都有喊捉贼的人，就急忙混入人群，用手随便一指，也跟着叫起“捉贼”“捉贼”来。
    也许因为这个故事流传得很广吧，直到现在还有人把这个贼作为自己的榜样。这个人就是法国外交次长富尔。据路透社报道，富尔8月底在法国古尔当发表演说时说：“如果埃及拒绝考虑伦敦会议遵守的原则，就证明它所抱的决不是国际合作精神，而主要是帝国主义的目的”。
    富尔所谓的“伦敦会议遵守的原则”，自然是指的杜勒斯计划中所体现的“国际化”的原则。但是，杜勒斯的原则并不是伦敦会议上提出来解决苏彝士运河问题的唯一原则。与它同时存在的，还有苏联、印度、印度尼西亚和锡兰主张充分尊重埃及主权的计划。而会议参与国一致同意把全部记录材料送交埃及政府，好让埃及政府能作充分和自由的考虑。富尔把杜勒斯的原则说成是什么“伦敦会议遵守的原则”，这是学的那个“聪明”的贼的第一个手法：“混入人群”，迷人耳目。
    混入人群以后，这个“聪明”的贼，就大喊“捉贼”起来。用富尔的话，就是大喊埃及是“帝国主义”。既然埃及是“帝国主义”，并且遭到富尔的愤怒指责，一望而知，富尔所代表的政府，自然就不在帝国主义之列了。
    但是，是埃及的部队集中到塞浦路斯去了吗？是埃及的军舰开到了马赛港吗？都不是，正好相反，是法国在对埃及施行武力威胁，而目的就是为了要埃及同意把它自己领土的一部分“国际化”。
    富尔也许自己觉得很聪明，可是，正像那个“聪明”的贼一样，人们终于发现那个喊“捉贼”的人原来就是贼骨头自己。富尔先生虽然想把“帝国主义”这顶帽子从自己头上摘掉，戴到埃及头上。可是正在他动手摘的时候，他的帝国主义的本相就已经暴露无遗了。　（丁）
