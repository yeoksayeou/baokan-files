The Turpan Five-Star Agricultural Production Cooperative, which is engaged in an international competition with the "Eastern Light" Collective Farm of the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic, has achieved a good harvest of 1,847 mu of cotton. According to the cotton field appraisal, 1,703 mu of cotton can yield an average of 400 jin of seed cotton per mu. The 144 mu of "Two and Three" long-staple cotton, which the cooperative planted for the first time this year, can yield 250 jin of seed cotton per mu. Both can reach the cotton yield target for participating in international competitions and break the historical record of large-scale cotton harvests by agricultural cooperatives in Turpan County.

This year, the Five-Star Cooperative paid attention to learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and comprehensively reformed production tools and cultivation techniques, ensuring full and strong seedlings and weed-free fields. In particular, in response to local conditions such as rapid water evaporation and insufficient base fertilizer in the soil, it frequently irrigated shallowly, applied chemical fertilizers such as superphosphate and ammonium sulfate, and also adopted foliar spraying, topdressing, and pest control methods. Therefore, although the cotton plants suffered from heat damage in the later stage of field management, they were still able to maintain sufficient bolls, and the weight of the cotton bolls was generally 20% higher than that of neighboring cooperatives, and the cotton boll picking period was also half a month earlier than last year. Now, the cooperative members are busy picking cotton.

    吐鲁番五星社棉花产量
    达到国际竞赛指标
    本报讯　同苏联哈萨克斯坦共和国“东方之光”集体农庄展开国际竞赛的吐鲁番五星农业生产合作社，一千八百四十七亩棉花获得好的收成。根据棉田鉴定的产量，有一千七百零三亩棉花平均每亩可收籽棉四百斤；今年这个社第一次种植的一百四十四亩“二与三”长绒棉，每亩可收籽棉二百五十斤，都可达到参加国际竞赛的棉花产量指标，并且突破了吐鲁番县历年来农业社大面积棉花丰收纪录。
    五星社今年植棉，注意学习苏联先进经验，全面进行了生产工具和耕作技术改革，做到苗全株壮，田地无杂草。特别是针对当地水分蒸发太快和土地基肥不足等情况，勤浇浅灌，追施过磷酸钙和硫酸氨等化学肥料，还采用了根外喷雾和追肥及杀虫方法。因此，田间管理的后期虽然遭受热风的灾害，棉株仍能保持足铃，棉桃重量一般比邻近各社高20％，棉桃收摘期也比去年提早了半个月。现在，社员们正在紧张地摘棉花。
