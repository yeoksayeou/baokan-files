    Important Events in the Cultural Exchange History of China and Indonesia
    China to Publish Collection of Paintings by President Sukarno

    (Our News) "Collection of Paintings by Engineer and Doctor Sukarno, President of the Republic of Indonesia" will soon be published in Beijing, the capital of our country. This is a momentous event in the history of cultural exchange between the peoples of China and Indonesia.

    Dr. Sukarno is an art connoisseur and collector. He himself is also skilled in painting. Sukarno's collection over the years includes paintings, plaster sculptures, wood carvings, stone carvings, bronze statues, ancient Chinese porcelain, antiques, jade carvings produced in recent years, and complete sets of shadow puppets, all of which are displayed in the famous Independence Palace, State Palace, Bogor Palace, and Cipanas Palace. Dr. Sukarno's private collection of paintings concentrates the essence of Indonesian art. The two hundred and six paintings selected for this collection are representative works from his entire collection. In the inscription he wrote for the collection, Sukarno said that he was willing to publish his private collection of paintings in order to "further strengthen the brotherly friendship between the Chinese and Indonesian peoples."

    This collection of paintings will be published in two large volumes, folio size, bound in silk, with a slipcase. All paintings are printed in color using offset and copperplate printing. The text explanations are in Indonesian, Chinese, English, and Russian. The first volume of the collection includes traditional Indonesian folk paintings – Balinese paintings, and works by painters from China, Japan, Vietnam, India, the Philippines, the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, France, Portugal, Italy, Austria, the United States, and the United Kingdom. The second volume is entirely composed of paintings by contemporary Indonesian masters. Balinese paintings, with their strong oriental flavor and unique artistic style, use deep, simple colors and meticulous depictions to express the life, labor, religious activities, and customs of the Indonesian people. Modern Indonesian paintings are mostly oil paintings, but also include watercolors and pastels, with rich and broad themes and diverse styles, including revolutionary historical paintings, genre paintings, portraits, landscapes, and still life paintings. The landscape paintings, created by artists with deep affection for their motherland, such as "Bandung Plateau," "Five-Colored Lake," "Shore of Sarangan Lake," and "Landscape under Mount Merapi," take us to the enchanting realm of this archipelago nation. The Indonesian women under the portrait painters' brushes are so vivid, healthy, and beautiful. The painters have successfully expressed the simple, honest, enthusiastic character and tenacious, optimistic spirit of ordinary Indonesian people. The collection of foreign paintings in the album includes many very precious and artistically valuable works.

    This collection of paintings is the crystallization of the friendly cooperation between Chinese and Indonesian art and publishing workers. Dura, a painter from the Indonesian Presidential Palace, is responsible for the compilation and selection of this collection. On the Chinese side, Shao Yu, editor-in-chief of the People's Fine Arts Publishing House, and Jiang Xinzhi, director of the Beijing Fine Arts Printing Factory, were dispatched to Indonesia in January this year to carry out preparations for publication. This collection of paintings is being printed and published by our country's People's Fine Arts Publishing House. (Photo attached)

    本报讯　“印度尼西亚共和国总统苏加诺工学士、博士藏画集”日内将在我国首都北京出版。这是中国和印度尼西亚两国人民文化交流史上具有重大纪念意义的事件。
    苏加诺博士是一位艺术鉴赏家和收藏家。他自己也擅长绘画。苏加诺历年来收藏的绘画、石膏塑像、木刻、石雕刻、铜像、古代中国的瓷器、古董和近年出品的玉雕器皿以及整套的皮影戏等艺术品，都布置在著名的独立宫、国家宫、茂物宫和芝班纳斯宫里。苏加诺博士的私人藏画，集中了印度尼西亚美术作品的精华。选入这部藏画集的二百零六幅绘画，是他全部藏画中的具有代表性的作品。苏加诺在为藏画集写的题词中说，他愿意把私人收藏的绘画选印出版，是“为了使中国人民和印度尼西亚人民之间的兄弟般的友谊更加密切”。
    这部藏画集分成上下两巨册出版，六开本，绢面精装，外附书函。全部绘画用彩色胶版和铜版精印。文字说明用印度尼西亚、中、英、俄四种文字。藏画集上集绘画包括印度尼西亚传统的民族绘画——峇厘画，和中国、日本、越南、印度、菲律宾、荷兰、比利时、瑞士、法国、葡萄牙、意大利、奥地利、美国、英国等各国画家的作品，下集全部是印度尼西亚当代名家的绘画。具有浓厚东方情调和独特艺术风格的峇厘画，以深沉、朴素的设色、精工细致的描写，表现了印度尼西亚人民的生活、劳动、宗教活动和风俗习惯。印度尼西亚的近代绘画，多数是油画，也有水彩画和色粉画等，题材丰富广阔，表现风格也是多种多样，其中有革命历史画、风俗画、肖像画、风景画和静物画等。艺术家们怀着对于祖国深厚感情描绘的风景画，如“万隆高原”、“五彩湖”、“沙浪湖岸”、“墨拉比火山下的风景”等，把我们带到了这个群岛之国的令人神往的境地。肖像画家们笔下的印度尼西亚妇女是那么生动、健康而美丽。画家们成功地表现了印度尼西亚普通人民的淳厚、朴实、热情的性格和顽强乐观的精神。藏画集中收集的外国画家的绘画，有许多是非常珍贵和具有艺术价值的作品。
    这部藏画集是中国和印度尼西亚两国美术和出版工作者友谊合作的结晶。印度尼西亚总统府画家杜拉担任这本藏画集的编选工作。中国方面在今年一月间就派遣人民美术出版社总编辑邵宇和北京美术印刷厂厂长姜信之等前往印度尼西亚进行出版准备工作。这部藏画集正由我国人民美术出版社印刷出版。（附图片）
