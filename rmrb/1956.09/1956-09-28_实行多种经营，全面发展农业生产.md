Implement Diversified Operations and Comprehensively Develop Agricultural Production
Speech by Comrade Chen Manyuan, First Secretary of the CPC Guangxi Provincial Committee

Only diversified operations can rationally utilize the potential of the land, fully utilize labor and improve labor productivity, avoid labor shortages during busy farming seasons and idleness during slack seasons, and fully utilize various possibilities to create more wealth. In other words, only then can the superiority of the socialist agricultural economy be brought into fuller play and agricultural production be highly developed.

I fully agree with the reports of Comrades Liu Shaoqi, Deng Xiaoping, and Zhou Enlai. Now I would like to express some opinions on the comprehensive development of agricultural and sideline production in Guangxi Province.

In the spring of this year, Guangxi Province achieved the socialist agricultural cooperativization, and the number of peasant households participating in advanced agricultural production cooperatives reached 98.2 percent of the total number of peasant households. After agricultural cooperativization, it is necessary to comprehensively consider and arrange the development of agricultural production. To develop production, a lot of work needs to be done, but implementing the policy of diversified operations and comprehensively developing agricultural production is an extremely important guiding principle.

This spring, in guiding agricultural production, the Guangxi Provincial Party Committee, due to insufficient understanding of the new contradictions and new problems arising after the fundamental change in rural production relations, did not well implement the policy of comprehensive development of production. While focusing on grain production (grain is the foundation of agricultural production, and increasing grain production is very important), it relaxed sideline production, especially sideline production of cooperative members' families. As a result, although the province achieved a large increase in the spring and summer harvest of grain crops this year, some places still could not make up for the losses caused by the reduction in sideline production; although cash crops generally increased compared with last year, they did not complete the planting plan. This not only directly affected the increase in the income of cooperative members, but also affected the supply of industrial raw materials and people's non-staple food. This lesson is profound. It must be admitted that the socialist agricultural economy, by breaking away from the limitations of scattered individual operation, can utilize funds, manpower, and land more rationally, and it should be said that it has more favorable conditions for comprehensive development of production. The significant achievements we have made in grain production in the first half of this year are proof of this. The poor performance of cash crops and sideline production cannot be regarded as an inevitable defect brought about by agricultural cooperativization; the reason for the poor performance is mainly due to subjectivism and bureaucracy in the leadership of the Provincial Party Committee, and the failure to conduct in-depth research and investigation, so it cannot timely grasp the new problems caused by the new production relations, and correctly guide agricultural production work according to the new situation.

Guangxi has excellent natural conditions for developing agricultural production

Guangxi Province is located in the subtropics, and the natural conditions for developing agricultural production are excellent. Grain can be harvested twice or three times a year, trees can mature in about fifteen years, freshwater aquaculture can be developed in reservoirs in various places, evergreen wild grass can be used for grazing cattle and sheep, and there are extremely rich local and special products. There are also many types of cash crops suitable for planting, and we need to pay special attention to the development of cash crops. The total area of the province is more than 320 million mu, of which cultivated land is more than 37 million mu, accounting for only 11.5 percent, forest area is more than 24 million mu, accounting for 7.5 percent, and in addition to about 21 percent being rocky mountains, there are more than 130 million mu of barren mountains and wasteland that can be utilized. As long as we gradually utilize these rich resources on the basis of cooperativization and develop diversified economies, we can significantly improve people's lives and make more contributions to socialist construction. Guangxi farmers have always engaged in diversified operations. The general operating habits are: sideline occupations support agriculture, agriculture supports forestry, early-maturing crops support late-maturing crops, and they cooperate with each other to increase income from multiple sources. In 1955, grain crops accounted for 46.53 percent of the total agricultural output value of the province, cash crops accounted for 8.61 percent, and sideline occupations accounted for 44.86 percent. It can be seen that diversified operations have a significant meaning in agricultural production in our province. Due to various reasons, in the next few years, the production of cooperatives will still be basically carried out by manpower and animal power. In this case, the rich experience accumulated by farmers over thousands of years in diversified operations, mutual cooperation, and comprehensive development of production must not only be brought into play now, but also must not be simplified to the single aspect of agricultural production even after the realization of agricultural mechanization in the future. Only diversified operations can rationally utilize the potential of the land, fully utilize labor and improve labor productivity, avoid labor shortages during busy farming seasons and idleness during slack seasons, and fully utilize various possibilities to create more wealth. In other words, only then can the superiority of the socialist agricultural economy be brought into fuller play and agricultural production be highly developed. In Guangxi Province, every township and cooperative has the conditions for diversified operations. In the mountainous areas inhabited by ethnic minorities, where there are many mountains and little land, it is even more necessary to "rely on the mountains to eat the mountains and rely on the water to eat the water", adapt to local conditions, and develop agriculture, forestry, fishery, animal husbandry, and sideline production in order to gradually improve the lives of farmers and gradually change the face of the mountainous areas. Guangxi's industry is relatively backward, but it has good conditions for development. In addition to developing many natural mineral deposits and gradually using them to establish heavy industry, it is more important to develop light industry and turn Guangxi into a base for sugar making, papermaking, food, and textile industries. The development of these light industries first requires a large increase in various cash crops and rural sideline products, such as sugarcane, jute, ramie, sisal hemp, sea island cotton, spices, beverages, subtropical fruits, pigs, cattle, sheep, etc., in order to guarantee the supply of raw materials and prepare conditions for factory construction and production. It can be seen that comprehensive development of agricultural production is an unshakable basic policy in Guangxi's economic construction.

The primary task is to increase grain production

In the comprehensive development of agricultural production, the primary task is still to increase grain production. In Guangxi, increasing grain production mainly depends on increasing the yield per unit area, and grain planting is basically stabilized on the existing grain field area. Because: (1) The yield per unit area of grain in Guangxi is very low, with an average yield of only 340 jin per mu of cultivated land. Cultivation is still very extensive in many places. In the past, some Zhuang areas "had no pig pens, no cattle pens, and no toilets for people", and the amount of fertilizer applied to the land was very small, so the yield was very inconsistent with the excellent natural conditions. There is a lot of room for increasing the yield per unit area. (2) The multiple cropping index of grain crops is only 180 percent, and 20 percent of the cultivated land is planted only once a year. If we can work hard and increase the multiple cropping index to 230 percent by 1967, then the existing 32 million mu of cultivated land can be increased to 73.6 million mu of sown area. Assuming that each mu of sown area can produce 300 jin, the total grain output of the province can reach 22 billion jin. Assuming that the population increases to 22 million, each person can get an average of 1,000 jin of grain. From this big account, it can be seen that the area of grain cultivated land no longer needs to be expanded to meet the needs of people's food rations, feed grain, and grain supply to the state. Of course, when expanding the multiple cropping area, it is necessary to calculate the yield, manpower and material consumption, and weigh the actual gains and losses. One cannot blindly pursue the multiple cropping index. For example, it is successful to change single-season rice to double-season rice. When double-season rice changes to three seasons, if a season of wheat is added to the double-season rice field, then it needs to be considered.

Vigorously develop cash crops

While grasping the increase in grain production, it is necessary to fully utilize the superior natural conditions according to the regional characteristics of Guangxi, vigorously develop cash crops, and expand the planting area of cash crops. At present, the planting area of cash crops is only 5 million mu, which must be gradually increased according to the needs of light industry development. According to preliminary planning, by 1967, sugarcane can be developed to 3 million mu, ramie and jute to 1.3 million mu, flue-cured tobacco to 600,000 mu, and coffee, rubber, citronella, sisal hemp, etc. to a total of more than 6 million mu. The land required for developing cash crops is mainly solved by reclaiming wasteland (some cash crops can be rotated with grain). If the planting area of cash crops can reach 10 million to 12 million mu, then the economic value of its production will greatly exceed that of grain.

Do a good job in farmers' family sideline production

In the comprehensive development of agricultural production, there is another very important issue, which is to do a good job in farmers' family sideline production. On this issue, there is often a misconception: since agricultural production has been cooperativized, why emphasize doing a good job in family sideline production? Yes, the economy under the unified management of the cooperative is the most important, but family sideline production is still an indispensable part of the agricultural economy (accounting for about 10 to 20 percent of the actual income of a cooperative member's family). Doing a good job in family sideline production can further promote the development of the collective economy and ensure the increase in the income of cooperative members. Therefore, family sideline production and the collective economy are not opposed to each other, but unified; they are not dispensable, but must be done well. Family sideline production is not only particularly important in the first few years after cooperativization, but should never be relaxed in the future. We were not clear about this idea in the first half of this year, which has already led to no small losses. This has only changed significantly after we implemented the Central Committee's instructions on running cooperatives diligently and thriftily in April of this year. In order to promote the development of sideline production, attention should be paid to the rational division of labor between the cooperative and the members in management: sideline production that is conducive to collective management should be managed uniformly by the cooperative; sideline production that is conducive to decentralized management should be managed by the cooperative members' families; for those that are conducive to both parties' management, the cooperative should manage and also help the cooperative members' families to manage; those that can be managed jointly by the cooperative and the members can also take joint management methods. At the same time, provinces, counties, townships, and cooperatives should designate certain institutions and specialized personnel to be responsible for guiding sideline production.

Implementing the policy of comprehensive development of production is a long-term policy. It is necessary to make leaders at all levels realize the importance of comprehensive development of production for ensuring the balanced development of the national economy, ensuring the increase in income of cooperative members and the consolidation of cooperatives. It is necessary to overcome the phenomenon of grasping grain production while neglecting cash crops and sideline production, and at the same time, prevent any tendency to relax grain production. In order to better implement this policy, from the province to the cooperative, there should be a plan in accordance with the central government's agricultural production development outline. When formulating this plan, the upper-level targets should only be used as guidelines, not as "laws". The cooperative should formulate the plan according to its own production conditions, so that the plan is in line with reality. Then, after summarizing and balancing, the province's targets will be determined, so that agricultural production can be comprehensively developed in a planned manner.

    实行多种经营，全面发展农业生产
    中共广西省委员会第一书记　陈漫远同志的发言
    只有多种经营，才能够合理地利用土地潜力，才能够充分发挥劳动力和提高劳动生产率，才能够避免农忙劳力不足农闲无事可做，才能够充分利用各种可能性更多地创造财富，也就是说，才能够更大地发挥社会主义农业经济的优越性，高度发展农业生产。
    我完全同意刘少奇同志、邓小平同志和周恩来同志的报告。现在我就广西省全面发展农、副业生产问题发表一些意见。
    广西省在今年春季已经实现了社会主义的农业合作化，参加高级农业生产合作社的农户已经达到总农户的百分之九十八点二。在农业合作化以后，就需要全面地考虑安排发展农业生产的问题。为了发展生产要做许多工作，但贯彻实行多种经营，全面发展农业生产，则是极其重要的指导方针。
    今年春季，广西省委在农业生产的指导上，由于对农村生产关系根本改变以后所产生的新的矛盾、新的问题认识不足，没有很好贯彻全面发展生产的方针，抓住了粮食生产（粮食是农业生产的基础，增产粮食是十分重要的），放松了副业，尤其是社员家庭副业生产。因此今年全省春收、夏收粮食作物虽然获得较大的增产，但有的地方仍不能弥补因副业减少所受到的损失；经济作物虽然一般比去年有所增长，但却未完成种植计划。这样，就不但直接影响了社员收入的增加，而且影响了工业原料和人民副食品的供应。这个教训是沉重的。必须承认，社会主义农业经济由于摆脱了分散的个体经营的限制，资金、人力、土地可以更加合理地利用，对全面发展生产应该说具备着更为有利的条件，今年上半年我们在粮食生产上所取得的显著成绩，就是事实的证明。而经济作物和副业生产开展不好，决不能认为是农业合作化所必然带来的缺陷；其所以搞不好，主要是省委领导上存在着主观主义和官僚主义，没有深入地去做调查研究工作，因此也不能及时抓住新的生产关系所引起的新问题，根据新的情况来正确指导农业生产工作。
    广西发展农业生产的自然条件十分优越
    广西省地处亚热带，发展农业生产的自然条件是优越的。粮食一年可两熟或三熟，树木大约十五年左右可以成材，各地山塘水库可以发展淡水养殖，四季长青的野草可供放牧牛羊，还有极其丰富的土产特产，适宜于种植的经济作物种类也很多，对发展经济作物需要我们特别的重视。全省总面积三万二千余万亩，其中耕地三千七百余万亩，仅占百分之十一点五，森林面积二千四百余万亩，占百分之七点五，除了约百分之二十一为石山外，还有一万三千余万亩是荒山荒地，可供利用。只要我们在合作化的基础上，逐步地运用这些富饶的资源，发展多种经济，就可以显著地提高人民生活，为社会主义建设作出更多的贡献。广西农民历来都是从事多种经营的，一般的经营习惯是：副业与农业、农业与林业、早熟作物与晚熟作物互相支持，彼此配合，从多方面增加收入。在一九五五年全省农业总产值中，粮食作物占百分之四十六点五三，经济作物占百分之八点六一，副业占百分之四十四点八六，可见多种经营在我省农业生产上有着重大的意义。由于各种原因，在今后若干年内合作社的生产基本上仍然是依靠人力、畜力来进行的，在这种情况下，对于几千年来农民积累的多种经营互相配合、全面发展生产的丰富经验不只在现在必须很好加以发挥，就是在将来农业机械化实现以后，也决不能把农业生产单一化。只有多种经营，才能够合理地利用土地潜力，才能够充分发挥劳动力和提高劳动生产率，才能够避免农忙劳力不足农闲无事可做，才能够充分利用各种可能性更多地创造财富，也就是说，才能够更大地发挥社会主义农业经济的优越性，高度发展农业生产。在广西省，乡乡社社都具备着多种经营的条件，在少数民族居住的山区，山多地少，更加要“靠山吃山、靠水吃水”，因地制宜，发展农、林、渔、牧和副业生产，才能逐步改善农民的生活，逐步改变山区的面貌。广西工业是比较落后的，但是有着很好的发展条件。除了许多天然矿藏可以开发，逐步地利用来建立重工业以外，更重要的是发展轻工业，把广西变为制糖、造纸、食品、纺织工业的一个基地。而这些轻工业的发展，首先要求各种经济作物和农村副业产品，如甘蔗、黄麻、苎麻、剑麻、海岛棉、香料、饮料、亚热带水果、猪、牛、羊等等大量增产，才能保证原料的供应，为建厂生产准备条件。由此可见，在广西的经济建设中，全面发展农业生产，是不可动摇的基本方针。
    首要任务是增产粮食
    在全面发展农业生产中，首要的任务仍然是增产粮食。在广西，增产粮食又主要地依靠提高单位面积产量，粮食种植基本上稳定在现有粮田面积上。因为：（1）广西粮食单位面积产量是很低的，每一耕地亩的平均产量仅达三百四十斤，许多地方耕作还很粗放，某些僮族地区过去“猪无栏，牛无圈，人无厕所”，种地施肥量很少，所以产量与优越的自然条件是很不相称的，提高单位面积产量大有可为，（2）粮食作物的复种指数只达百分之一百八十，还有百分之二十的耕地是一年种一季。如果能够抓紧努力，到一九六七年将复种指数提高到百分之二百三十，则现有三千二百万亩耕地就可增至播种亩七千三百六十万亩，以每一播种亩能产三百斤计算，全省粮食总产量可达二百二十亿斤，按人口增至二千二百万计，每人平均可得粮食一千斤。从这笔大账中，可以看出粮食耕地面积不再扩大是可以满足人民口粮、饲料粮和提供国家用粮需要的。当然，在扩大复种面积时，要对产量、人力物力消耗加以计算，权衡实际得失，不可盲目追求复种指数。譬如，单季稻变为双季稻是成功的，双季稻变三季时，如果是在双季稻田加种一季小麦，那就需要考虑。
    大力发展经济作物
    在抓紧粮食增产的同时，必须按照广西的地区特点，充分利用优越的自然条件，大力地发展经济作物，扩大经济作物的种植面积。现在经济作物的种植面积只有五百万亩，必须根据轻工业发展的需要，逐步增加。根据初步的规划，到一九六七年，甘蔗可发展到三百万亩，苎麻黄麻发展到一百三十万亩，烤烟六十万亩，咖啡、橡胶、香茅、剑麻等等共计六百余万亩。发展经济作物所需的土地主要从开垦荒地来解决（有些经济作物可与粮食轮作）。如果经济作物种植面积能够达到一千万至一千二百万亩，则其生产的经济价值将大大超过粮食。
    搞好农民家庭副业生产
    在全面发展农业生产中，还有一个很重要的问题，这就是切实做好农民家庭副业生产的问题。在这个问题上，往往存有这样一个错觉：农业生产既然已经合作化了，又何必强调做好家庭副业生产呢？是的，合作社统一经营的经济是最主要的，但家庭副业仍然是农业经济的一个不可缺少的组成部分（在一户社员的实际收入上大约占其总收入的百分之十至百分之二十），家庭副业做好了，更可以促进集体经济的发展，又能够保证社员收入的增加。所以，家庭副业与集体经济不是对立的，而是统一的；不是可有可无的，而是必须做好的；家庭副业不但是在合作化以后的最初几年显得特别重要，就在以后也决不应该放松。我们在今年上半年这个思想还不清楚，因而已经招致了不小的损失。这在我们贯彻执行了今年四月中央关于勤俭办社的指示以后，才有了明显的改变。为了推动副业的发展，应该注意到合作社与社员在经营上合理分工：利于集体经营的副业，由社统一经营；利于分散经营的副业，应该由社员家庭各自经营；利于双方经营的，社经营也帮助社员家庭经营；可以社和社员联合经营的，亦可采取联合经营的办法。同时，省、县、乡和社，指定一定机构和专门人员，负责指导副业生产。
    贯彻执行全面发展生产的方针，是长时期的方针。必须使各级领导都认识全面发展生产对于保证国民经济的均衡发展，保证合作社员增加收入和合作社的巩固的重要性，既要克服抓住了粮食生产，而忽视了经济作物和副业生产的现象，同时也要防止任何放松粮食生产的偏向。为了更好地贯彻这个方针，从省到社，按照中央农业生产发展纲要，都应该有个计划。合作社在制订此项计划时，上级指标应该只能作为指向，而不能当作“法令”，合作社应当按照自己的生产条件来制定计划，使计划切合实际，然后，经过汇总平衡，定出省的指标来，使农业生产有计划地全面发展。
