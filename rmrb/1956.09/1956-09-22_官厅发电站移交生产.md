    Guanting Power Station Handed Over for Production
    (Our newspaper dispatch) The first automated Guanting Hydroelectric Power Station, designed and surveyed, equipped and constructed and installed by our own country, was officially handed over for production on September 15th.
    Since the first generating unit was put into operation ahead of schedule in December 1955, the remaining two generating units were successively installed in April of this year and temporarily handed over to the Guanting Hydroelectric Power Plant of the Beijing Electric Power Bureau for operation. During the temporary operation, further adjustments were made to the units many times, and based on the needs of the production unit, many engineering projects not included in the original design were added, ensuring the quality of the project, the safe operation of the machines, and convenient operation.

    官厅发电站移交生产
    本报讯　由我国自己勘测设计、制造设备和建筑安装的第一座自动化官厅水力发电站，在9月15日正式移交生产。
    这个电站自第一台机组于1955年12月提前发电后，其余两台机组在今年4月相继安装完成，临时移交北京电业局官厅水力发电厂运行。在临时运行中，对机组进一步作了多次调整，并且根据生产单位的要求，从实际需要出发，增建了很多设计以外的工程项目，确实保证工程质量，并保证机器安全运行和便利运行。
