    Rapid Development of Ethnic Education in Various Regions
    Hunan Minority Youth
    Enter Middle School in Large Numbers This Year
    According to Xinhua News Agency, Jianghua Yao Autonomous County in Hunan Province, which previously did not even have a single Yao higher primary school graduate, has seventy-three Yao youths entering the newly built Jianghua National Middle School this new school year. The development of ethnic minority education in Hunan Province is very rapid. This new school year, there are 1,200 to 1,300 Miao, Dong, Yao, Hui, and other ethnic minority youths entering secondary schools, an increase of 50% compared to last year. This year, Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Prefecture has 1,000 Miao students entering secondary schools, almost equal to the total number of Miao middle school students in the autonomous prefecture since liberation seven years ago. In the new school year, the number of ethnic minority primary school students in Hunan Province has also increased to more than 78,000, an increase of more than 20,000 compared to last year.
    This year, the Hunan Provincial Department of Education has also set up special ethnic minority classes in secondary schools in Zhijiang, Lingling, Huang County, Jishou and other places, and attached junior high school classes to full primary schools in mountainous areas where various ethnic farmers live, absorbing a large number of Miao, Dong, Yao and other ethnic youths into schools.

    Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture
    Establishes First Normal School
    Xinhua News Agency: Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture in Sichuan Province is building a normal school—Zhaojue National Normal School. This is the first school established in the autonomous prefecture to train teachers for newly built primary schools in the future. The school plans to enable illiterate Yi students to reach the level of first or second grade students of inland junior normal schools within three years of study, and enable Han students to use the Yi language for teaching. At present, the enrollment work has already begun.
    At the same time, the autonomous prefecture also established an accelerated normal school, and opened accelerated normal classes in two middle schools.
    Since liberation, the number of primary schools in the autonomous prefecture has increased year by year. At present, there are 72 primary schools in the prefecture, and 17 ethnic primary schools have also been established in Yi-inhabited areas where there were no schools in the past. In the second half of this year, the autonomous prefecture will also establish 19 ethnic primary schools.

    Wuzhong Hui Autonomous Prefecture
    The Number of Primary and Middle School Students Gradually Increases
    According to Xinhua News Agency, this year there are already more than 1,400 students of all ethnic groups in middle schools and normal schools in Wuzhong Hui Autonomous Prefecture, Gansu Province, more than triple the number last year. The number of primary school students has increased to more than 20,000, an increase of more than 7,000 compared with the previous semester.
    This year, the autonomous prefecture established middle schools in Jinji, Lingwu, and Tongxin counties, which originally had no middle schools, so that all five counties and cities in the autonomous prefecture have secondary schools. In addition to the original 160 primary schools, the autonomous prefecture has added dozens of primary schools.

    More Than 40 Miao Youths in Xiangxi
    Admitted to Universities This Year
    Xinhua News Agency: In this year's university entrance examination, more than 40 Miao young men and women in Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Prefecture were admitted to schools such as the Central South Institute for Nationalities, Hunan Normal College, Hunan Agricultural College, and Beijing Medical College. They are the first group of Miao youths to graduate from secondary schools after liberation.
    Before liberation, there were almost no students in Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Prefecture. Now, a national middle school, two national normal schools, and twelve ordinary middle schools have been established in the deep mountains where the Miao people live, absorbing a large number of Miao youths into schools.

    各地民族教育事业迅速发展
    湖南少数民族青年
    今年大批进入中学
    据新华社讯　从前连一个瑶族高小毕业生都没有的湖南省江华瑶族自治县，在今年的新学年里有七十三个瑶族青少年进入了刚落成的江华民族中学。湖南省少数民族教育事业发展很快。今年新学年进入中等学校的苗、侗、瑶、回等少数民族青少年有一千二、三百人，比去年增加50％。今年，湘西苗族自治州有一千个苗族学生进入中等学校，几乎等于解放七年来自治州苗族中学生的总和。在新学年里，湖南省少数民族小学生也发展到七万八千多人，比去年增加二万多人。
    今年，湖南省教育厅还分别在芷江、零陵、晃县、吉首等地的中等学校里专设了少数民族班，并在各族农民聚居的山区的完全小学里附设初中班，吸收大批苗、侗、瑶等族青少年入学。凉山彝族自治州
    建立第一所师范学校
    新华社讯　四川省凉山彝族自治州正在修建一所师范学校——昭觉民族师范，这是自治州建立的第一所为今后新建小学培养师资的学校。这所学校计划在三年学习时间内，使不识字的彝族学生达到具有内地初级师范一二年级的水平，使汉族学生能使用彝文教课。目前，招生工作已经开始。
    和这同时，自治州还建立了一所速成师范学校，并在两所中学内开办了速成师范班。
    解放以来自治州小学逐年增加。目前全州已有小学七十二所，在过去从无学校的彝族聚居区还建立了十七所民族小学。今年下半年，自治州还要建立十九所民族小学。
    吴忠回族自治州
    中小学生逐渐增加
    据新华社讯　今年甘肃省吴忠回族自治州的中学和师范学校的各族学生已经有一千四百多人，比去年增加三倍以上；小学生增加到两万多名，比上学期增加七千多名。
    今年自治州在原来没有中学的金积、灵武、同心三县设立了中学，使自治州五个县、市都有了中等学校。在原有的一百六十所小学之外，自治州又增加了数十所小学。
  湘西四十多名苗族青年
    今年考进高等学校
    新华社讯　在这一届高等学校的考试当中，湘西苗族自治州有四十多名苗族男女青年考进了中南民族学院、湖南师范学院、湖南农学院和北京医学院等学校。他们都是解放后第一批从中等学校毕业出来的苗族青年。
    解放前，湘西苗族自治州几乎没有学生。现在，在苗家居住的深山里已经建立了一所民族中学、二所民族师范和十二所普通中学，吸收了大批苗族青年入学。
