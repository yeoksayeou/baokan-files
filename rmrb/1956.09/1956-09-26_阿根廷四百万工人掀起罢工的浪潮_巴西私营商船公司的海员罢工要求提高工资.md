    Xinhua News Agency, Buenos Aires: Recently, approximately four million organized workers in various industries in Argentina have been staging successive strikes across the country to demand the signing of new wage increase contracts.

    On September 21st, another 60,000 maritime workers held a 24-hour strike, bringing shipping operations to a standstill in all Argentine ports. This strike was triggered by the breakdown of negotiations between workers and employers over the signing of a new contract. The Argentine Minister of Labor, Migone, unable to facilitate a successful negotiation, had to resign on the same day the strike occurred.

    This strike is the second maritime workers' strike in Argentina in less than ten days. On September 13th, 18,000 seamen had already held a strike.

    The nationwide general strike of two million commercial workers on September 14th was the largest strike recently. In addition, Argentine shipbuilding workers also held a strike not long ago. Over the past month, workers in many industries have joined the ranks of the strikers.

    Electrical workers, garment workers, and communication workers in radio, telegraph, etc., have slowed down their work progress. They announced that if employers refuse to increase their wages, they will use strikes to support their demands.

    Reuters said that the nationwide strike wave is "threatening" the Aramburu government. In an attempt to suppress the strikes, the Aramburu government has intensified its persecution of progressive forces. On September 14th and 15th, it conducted continuous searches of organizations such as the Argentine Human Rights League, the Argentine Women's Federation, the Argentine Peace Committee, and the Argentina-Soviet Cultural Association, and made arrests.

    Xinhua News Agency, Montevideo, September 23rd (TASS): According to newspaper reports, 25,000 seamen from Brazilian private merchant shipping companies began a strike on September 21st, demanding wage increases. The striking workers pointed out in their statement that since 1954, seamen of private merchant shipping companies have been demanding the same wage treatment as seamen of state-owned companies, but this demand has not been met.

    阿根廷四百万工人掀起罢工的浪潮
    巴西私营商船公司的海员罢工要求提高工资
    新华社讯　布宜诺斯艾利斯消息：最近一个时期以来，阿根廷各行业有组织的约四百万工人为要求签订增加工资的新合同，一直在全国各地此落彼起地进行罢工。
    在9月21日又有六万个海员工人举行了二十四小时的罢工，罢工使阿根廷所有港口的航运工作停顿。这次罢工是工人和雇主之间就签订新合同的谈判破裂引起的。阿根廷的劳工部长米戈内因为无法促成谈判成功，只好在发生罢工的当天提出辞职。
    这次罢工是阿根廷在不到十天之内的第二次海员罢工。在9月13日，曾经有一万八千海员举行过罢工。
    9月14日两百万商业工人的全国性总罢工是最近规模最大的一次罢工。此外，阿根廷的造船工人在不久以前也举行了罢工。在过去一个多月内，许多行业的工人都加入了罢工的队伍。
    电力工人、成衣工人、以及无线电、电报等通讯工人都放慢了工作进度。他们宣布，如果雇主们拒绝增加他们的工资，他们就要用罢工，来支持自己的要求。
    路透社说，波及全国的罢工热潮“正在威胁着”阿兰布鲁政府。为了企图把罢工镇压下去，阿兰布鲁政府加紧迫害进步力量。它在9月14日、15日两天连续搜查阿根廷人权联盟、阿根廷妇女联合会、阿根廷和平委员会以及阿根廷—苏联文化协会等组织，同时进行了逮捕。
    新华社讯　塔斯社蒙得维的亚23日讯：据报纸消息，巴西私营商船公司的两万五千个海员在9月21日开始罢工，要求提高工资。罢工工人在他们的声明中指出，从1954年起，私营商船公司的海员就要求和国营公司海员享有同样的工资待遇，但是这个要求一直没有得到满足。
