    Don't Let Complete Sets of Machinery Sleep
    In a building of the Heilongjiang Provincial Food Factory of the China Food Company, a complete set of glycerine machines is installed. Due to long-term lack of responsibility, the machines have been sleeping soundly for eight or nine years, covered in rust, and have begun to age.
    This set of machines has complete and intact equipment, including vacuum tanks, oil storage tanks, filters, vacuum pumps, compressors, and other devices. Since the liberation of Northeast China, this set of machines has never been started. It is said that this set of machines was designed by a Japanese engineer, who did not consider the lifespan of the building at the time and blindly installed it. Later, fearing that the machine's vibration would cause the building to collapse, they dared not start it; at the same time, because the task changed and it was no longer needed, no one paid attention to it. Now, why not find a way to transfer it out and let it play a small role in industrial construction? I suggest that relevant authorities quickly deal with this issue and stop letting this complete set of machines sleep soundly.

### 不要让成套机器睡觉

    不要让成套机器睡觉
    中国食品公司黑龙江省食品工厂的一座大楼里，安着一组成套的甘油机。由于长期无人负责，机器酣睡了八、九年，铁锈满身，已经开始衰老了。
    这套机器拥有真空罐、贮油罐、过滤机、真空泵、压缩机等装置完好的全部设备。自从东北解放以来，这套机器一直没有开动过。据说，这套机器是一个日本工程师设计的，当时没有考虑到建筑物的寿命，就盲目地安装上了，后来因为怕机器震动房屋倒塌，不敢开动；同时也因为任务改变，不需要它了，也就无人过问。现在，为什么不设法把它调拨出去，让它在工业建设中发挥点滴的作用呢？我建议有关机关迅速处理这个问题，不要再让这成套的机器酣睡不醒了。
