    Such "Guidance"
    Sima Long

    Young people will encounter many problems on the path of life, some complex, some simple, some are matters of principle, and some are non-principled trivialities. Therefore, those who guide young people must be realistic. Matters of principle must be adhered to, but non-principled issues should not be forced into serious ideological problems. However, this is not always the case.

    If a girl is good in all aspects but "not pretty enough," and a young man "actually doesn't choose" her as a partner, then the young man is "blind to talent," and the commentator even "suspects" whether "there is something not quite clean in the depths of his soul..." (See Dongmen Wang's "A Letter in Reply to Comrade Li Fen" in the fourteenth issue of "China Youth" this year.) The suspicion in this answer is an empty "principle" used to write off young people's freedom to choose their partners in love.

    A female worker named Yingman was criticized by relatives and friends for falling in love with an officer from northern Jiangsu: "People from northern Jiangsu speak in an unpleasant accent and are not promising. Marrying him will not lead to a good outcome." The error in this chattering criticism could have been elevated to a genuine matter of principle for criticism, but Niu Zhichu instead seized on the phrase "people from northern Jiangsu speak in an unpleasant accent" to talk about some "law," saying that "a lover's voice is always beautiful," "Throughout history, the voice of a lover always sounds sweet, as intoxicating as spring. This can be considered a law!" Of course, "law" can be used as a major premise, and further suspicion arises: "Whether this female worker truly loves this officer is also a question." "This distress probably conceals some dislike for him that she cannot express." (See "Xinmin Evening News," August 2 this year.) What could it be? Probably some bourgeois ideology. Although the principle is very high, this "distressed" female worker has added new distress to her burden.

    This way of treating young people is too suspicious, always feeling that young people have many faults and cannot be trusted. So, others talk about appearance, and you suspect them; others talk about voice, and you suspect them, insisting on "digging out" something "not quite clean" from the "depths of young people's souls." You "dig" from appearance, and he "digs" from voice, and they "actually" dig out the same ideological problem, truly "great minds think alike." But the young people who are being dug feel apprehensive, trembling with fear, unable to move a step. If this continues, young people may become obedient, and the "depths of their souls" may be "cleaned" until they are "clean," but they will not be far from being half-dead.

    Moreover, some arguments guiding young people are indeed unconvincing. Take the question of beauty and "what position it occupies in love." Originally, as long as one's view of love is correct, choosing based on appearance is everyone's freedom. If you want to talk about principles from the perspective of "beauty," you should not ignore the objectivity of beauty, the relationship between subjective function and objective existence. If you overemphasize the subjective feelings of lovers, saying that "subjective understanding" can play a "significant role," and one-sidedly emphasize "beauty is in the eye of the beholder," it is not appropriate. It is as if physical beauty does not exist objectively; as long as you love someone, the object becomes beautiful; once something objectively not beautiful enters the subjective realm, it immediately becomes beautiful. By this reasoning, the Cui Yingying in Zhang Junrui's eyes, with her "cherry-red lips," "jade-white skin," and "warbling oriole voice outside the flowers," might have a mouth big enough to swallow a giant crab, a mouthful of yellowed and blackened teeth, and a voice worse than a crow's, so ugly that it is frightening. In this case, the beauty of Cui Yingying in Wang Shifu's writing is merely Zhang Junrui's subjective feeling. Literary artists deceive people, and they deserve to die ten thousand times. See, how wonderful, and how "decisive"! This certainly seems to be a very high principle, but unfortunately, it is so high that it enthusiastically embraces the subjective idealist aesthetic viewpoint.

    Such arguments probably won't stop. Because the human body structure is very complex, from hair to beard, to body hair, to voice, to facial features, to limbs, to white blood cells, to the appendix, and "so on," according to the logic of the commentators, there is much to be made of them, and ideological problems can be "dug out" from them, and some people will enthusiastically help to promote this to young people.

### 如此“指导”

    如此“指导”
  　司马龙
    青年人在人生的道路上会遇到很多问题，有的很复杂，有的很简单，有的是原则问题，有的是非原则的细枝末节。因此，指导青年的人必须实事求是，原则问题要坚持，而非原则的问题，也不要节外生枝地硬说成是严重的思想问题，可是事实并不是完全如此。
    如果有一位姑娘各方面都好，仅仅是“不够漂亮”，而小伙子“竟没有选择”她作爱人，那小伙子就是“有眼不识泰山”，评论者甚至“怀疑到”他的“灵魂深处是不是也有点不太干净的地方……”（见今年第十四期“中国青年”东门望“复李奋同志的一封信”）这种回答里的怀疑是架空的“原则”，用来一笔勾销青年们在恋爱时选择对象的自由。
    一位名叫影曼的女工因爱上一位苏北籍军官而受到亲戚朋友的非议：“苏北人说话难听，又没出息，和他结婚是没有好结果的。”这种嘁嘁喳喳的非议的错误，本来很可以提到真正的原则高度来加以批判的，可是牛之初却偏偏抓住“苏北人说话难听”一句话，大谈什么“定律”，说什么“恋人的声音总是美丽的”，“古往今来，凡是属于爱人的声音，听来总是甜蜜蜜的，像春天一样的令人陶醉，这也算是一个定律吧！”“定律”当然可作大前提，于是进一步怀疑“这位女工是否自己真正爱这位军官，也还是问题。”“这苦闷恐怕就孕藏着她对他还存在着某些说不出来的不喜欢吧。”（见今年8月2日“新民报晚刊”）什么呢？大概又是资产阶级思想作风之类。固然原则高得很，可是这位“苦闷”的女工却因此加上了新的苦闷。
    这样地对待青年，未免疑心太多了，总觉得青年们身上是非多，不大放心。于是别人讲外貌，怀疑一下；别人讲声音，怀疑一下，硬想从青年们的“灵魂深处”“挖出”点“不太干净的东西来”。你从外貌“挖”，他从声音“挖”，而且“竟”挖出了一样的思想问题，真是“英雄所见略同”。无奈被挖的青年却感到诚惶诚恐，胆颤心惊，连一步也动不得。长此下去，青年也许都老实了，“灵魂深处”被“挖”得“干净”了，可是，离不死不活也差不远了。
    而且，有些指导青年的议论也的确不让人信服。就以关于外貌美和“它在爱情中占何等地位”的问题说吧，本来只要恋爱观正确，选择外貌是每个人的自由。如果要想从“美”的角度来讲原则，也就不应该忽视美的客观性，主观作用和客观存在的关系。如果过分强调爱人的主观感觉，说什么“主观认识”能起“重大的作用”，片面强调“情人眼里出西施”，就不够妥当。这样仿佛外形的美不是客观的存在，只要爱了，对象也就美了；客观不美的一旦进入主观就立即美了。由此推论，那在张君瑞眼里是“樱桃红绽”、“玉粳白露”、“呖呖莺声花外啭”的崔莺莺，可能是有一张足吞巨蟹的大口，满口黄得发黑的板牙，一副赛过乌鸦的嗓门，丑得怕人。这样，王实甫笔下的崔莺莺的美只是张君瑞的主观感觉。文学艺术家骗人，罪该万死。瞧，多妙，又多么“来的干脆”！这固然显得原则高得很，可惜高到与主观唯心论的美学观点热烈地拥抱在一起了。
    这样的议论，恐怕还不易断绝。因为人身构造很复杂，由头发而胡须，而汗毛，而声音，而五官，而四肢，而白血球，而盲肠，而“等等”，按照评论者的逻辑，都大有文章可作，都能“挖”出思想问题来，而且也会有人热心地帮助向青年推销。
