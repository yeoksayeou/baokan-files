Speech by Comrade Xie Juezai, Minister of Internal Affairs

I fully agree with the Central Committee's political report, the report on revising the Party Constitution, and the report on the proposals for the Second Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy. I would like to express some opinions on preferential treatment, demobilization placement, and relief work.

The Party and the government are very concerned about the families of martyrs, military families, disabled veterans, and demobilized soldiers, as well as people who are experiencing difficulties in life for various reasons. In the seven years since the founding of the People's Republic, the state has done a lot of effective work in preferential treatment, demobilization placement, and relief, spending nearly 2.7 billion yuan in this area (excluding production subsidies for demobilized soldiers). At the same time, it has organized the masses to help families of martyrs, military families, and disabled veterans cultivate land, has placed demobilized soldiers, and has helped the elderly, weak, orphaned, widowed, and disabled solve their living difficulties, ensuring that their lives are basically guaranteed and that they are all properly placed. However, because the Ministry of Internal Affairs, which is in charge of this work, and the civil affairs departments at all levels, lack in-depth and meticulous work, do not understand the situation sufficiently, and do not care enough about the pain and suffering of those who should receive preferential treatment and relief, there are still many shortcomings in the work.

The victorious progress of socialist construction and socialist transformation, especially the high tide of agricultural cooperativization, has brought favorable conditions for preferential treatment, demobilization placement, and relief work, and this is correct. But it has also brought some new problems to these tasks. We have not paid enough attention to these new problems, so that some places have not been well resolved or resolved in a timely manner.

Properly Resolve New Issues in Preferential Treatment Work

In addition to the state's preferential treatment work, the fine tradition of "supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of soldiers" should be maintained and carried forward; various localities should establish a series of methods for transitioning from land cultivation to preferential labor days, adapting to local conditions.

What are some of these problems? Families of martyrs, military families, and disabled veterans generally had better land allocated to them in the past. After agricultural cooperativization, land was cultivated collectively, and land remuneration was abolished; cooperatives pay according to labor, while families of martyrs, military families, and disabled veterans who rely on substitute cultivation for preferential treatment are people with insufficient or no labor power. Although the model regulations for agricultural production cooperatives stipulate that the labor days they are entitled to for substitute cultivation can be regarded as their own labor days, and the regulations for advanced agricultural cooperatives stipulate that the cooperatives should still give preferential treatment in accordance with the state's regulations, this is still a very big change. Not only must staff at all levels, especially district and township staff, understand this, but the broad masses of peasants must also understand it. Because rural work is busy, we have not been able to do a good job in publicity and deployment in a timely manner, so that some places have not changed substitute cultivation to preferential labor days in a timely manner, or have changed it improperly, affecting the temporary living problems of some families of martyrs, military families, and disabled veterans with insufficient labor power. For example, as agricultural cooperatives increase production and the income of individual members increases, the income of families of martyrs, military families, and disabled veterans who have changed from substitute cultivation to labor day preferential treatment should also increase accordingly, and they should be included in the 90% or more of members whose income has increased. However, this meaning was only affirmed in the People's Daily editorial on August 1, which was already after the summer harvest distribution.

Some people say that the living difficulties of families of martyrs, military families, and disabled veterans should be completely borne by the state, and should no longer be partially borne by the masses. We say that as the national economy develops, the state can spend more money on preferential treatment work. But to completely take it on is not only limited by financial resources, but also requires leaving the masses' help and proper arrangements for labor production. It is impossible to solve the production and living difficulties of millions of families of martyrs, military families, and disabled veterans in all aspects very well. Moreover, "supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of soldiers" is a fine tradition of the broad masses of the people in defending the motherland and of unity between the army and the people. We should maintain and carry forward this tradition. Naturally, the government should still provide subsidies from the preferential treatment funds to certain cooperatives with a large number of families of martyrs, military families, and disabled veterans; and the original system of living allowances should still be implemented for certain families of martyrs, military families, and disabled veterans who still have difficulties after receiving labor day preferential treatment.

Some people say that preferential labor days increase the burden on the cooperative. We say that this is a transformation from the substitute cultivation method implemented for many years. Primary cooperatives convert the number of substitute cultivation days into preferential labor days, and advanced cooperatives incorporate the abolished land remuneration into labor day remuneration. This is not a new burden. In fact, according to investigations in many places, the preferential treatment burden is much lighter than before, and is still decreasing year by year.

With the development of agricultural cooperatives, rural preferential treatment work is much easier to do, but at present this matter cannot be completely pushed to the cooperatives. The government must also help, guide, and inspect, and establish a series of methods for transitioning from substitute cultivation to preferential labor days, adapting to local conditions.

Further Improve the Work of Placing Demobilized Soldiers

The Ministry of Internal Affairs and civil affairs departments at all levels should conduct in-depth inspections, propose methods, and properly resolve the problems existing in the work of placing demobilized soldiers; Party committees and various work departments at all levels should welcome, care for, and educate demobilized construction soldiers, so that they can all be properly placed and make the best use of their talents.

Demobilized soldiers have become an active factor in the construction of industry, agriculture, and other undertakings. Many rural governments and cooperatives have demobilized soldiers participating in their work, becoming the backbone of the work; many model deeds of demobilized soldiers have emerged in industry and other undertakings. Because of the development of socialist undertakings and the increase in employment opportunities, demobilized soldiers who need to be placed are easier to place. However, many places are often satisfied with the fact that more than 90% of people have been placed, and ignore the small number of people who are not easy to place properly; a few places and departments still have the phenomenon of repelling and attacking demobilized soldiers. There are also many problems in the allocation of work, the determination of treatment, and other aspects of those who have already been placed. For these problems, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and civil affairs departments at all levels must conduct in-depth inspections and propose proper solutions. At the same time, this work must be resolutely implemented by Party committees and various work departments at all levels, welcome them, care for them, educate them, so that they can all be properly placed, make the best use of their talents, and play an active role in the cause of socialist construction. No phenomenon of neglect or discrimination is allowed.

Social Relief Work Cannot Be Relaxed

In the case where agricultural cooperatives are not yet able to fully implement the "five guarantees," the strength of the state and the strength of the masses should be combined to solve the living problems of the elderly, weak, widowed, orphaned, and disabled who lack labor power.

"The elderly will be cared for until the end of their lives, the young will grow up, the strong will be employed, and the widowed, orphaned, and disabled will all be supported." This is the ideal of our ancient sages; the five guarantees stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft), such as ensuring food, clothing, fuel, education, and burial, are the realization of the above ideal. Our Party has always paid great attention to this work. "There are no beggars in the liberated areas" has long been a popular story, and it will definitely be done better in the future. What should be noted at present is that many agricultural production cooperatives are still weak, have little public welfare funds, and are not able to fully solve the living difficulties of the elderly, weak, widowed, orphaned, and disabled who lack labor power. We cannot ignore this situation, thinking that once cooperativization is achieved, all problems are solved, and relaxing the government's social relief work, so that the living difficulties of these people cannot be solved. In the case where cooperatives do not yet have the ability to fully implement the "five guarantees," social relief funds allocated by the state must be used to subsidize them, so that the strength of the state and the strength of the masses can be combined to solve the living problems of these people.

Strengthen Leadership over Civil Affairs Work

There are more than one million families of martyrs, more than 670,000 disabled veterans, more than 5 million demobilized soldiers, as well as families of officers and conscripts, as well as retirement benefits for staff, treatment for staff deaths and their family members, relief for poor people in urban and rural areas, relief for the unemployed, and relief for the deaf, blind, disabled, sick, and those who encounter misfortune. In short, civil affairs departments still have many things to do in these areas, and they extend to every corner of society. This work is an important part of socialist construction. Although it cannot directly produce steel or grain, it can produce huge political encouragement and can improve the enthusiasm of the broad masses for building socialism and defending socialism. Doing a good job in preferential treatment, demobilization placement, and relief work not only further encourages the people's army's will to defend the peace and construction of the motherland and the enthusiasm of the younger generation to enlist in the army at any time, but also makes the people feel that in our society, work and life are guaranteed, and improves their selfless dedication to the cause of socialist construction.

It is necessary to point out this point because some comrades do not have a sufficient understanding of this point. They believe that with the victory of socialist transformation and the rapid development of socialist construction, there is nothing to do in civil affairs work, and people engaged in civil affairs work have no future, and some want to transfer to other jobs. Our answer is negative. Civil affairs departments still have many things to do, and very important things to do (in addition to the above-mentioned work, there are also such things as disaster relief, immigration, and other work), and they need more capable cadres who are good at using their brains, mastering policies, and going deep into the masses to do it.

Some places are busy with other work, and civil affairs work is often not put on the agenda of Party and government work; or they think that civil affairs funds can be reduced, and often inappropriately misappropriate or compress them, and the civil affairs department is small in size and has few cadres, which makes some comrades engaged in civil affairs work feel depressed. For these problems, we hope that Party and government at all levels will pay attention and strengthen leadership over this work. Some civil affairs funds can be reduced, while others need to be increased, because the number of projects is increasing and the standards are improving. Undoubtedly, the proportion in the national budget is decreasing, but the absolute number should not only not be reduced, but also needs to be increased. The staffing of civil affairs personnel also needs to be appropriately adjusted.

If there is anything inappropriate in the above opinions, please correct them.

### 积极做好优抚、复员安置和救济工作

    积极做好优抚、复员安置和救济工作
    内务部部长　谢觉哉同志的发言
    我完全同意中央委员会的政治报告、修改党章的报告和发展国民经济的第二个五年计划的建议的报告。我想就优抚、复员安置和救济工作发表一点意见。
    党和政府对于烈属、军属、残废军人、复员军人是十分关怀的，对于因为各种原因而生活困难的人民也是很关怀的。建国七年来，国家在优抚、复员安置和救济工作上做了很多有成效的工作，用在这方面的经费将近二十七亿元（不包括复员军人的生产资助金）；同时组织群众帮助烈属、军属、残废军人代耕土地，对于复员军人进行安置，帮助老弱孤寡残疾的人们解决生活困难，使他们的生活都基本上得到了保障，各得其所。但是，因为专管这项工作的内务部和地方各级民政部门，工作缺乏深入细致，了解情况不够，关心应该受到优抚、救济的人们的痛痒不够，工作还有很多缺点。
    社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的胜利进展，特别是农业合作化的高潮，我们看到了它给优抚、复员安置和救济工作带来了有利的条件，这是对的。但同时也给这些工作带来了一些新的问题。我们对这些新问题注意不够，以致有些地方至今尚未得到很好的解决或解决得很不及时。
    妥善解决优抚工作中的新问题
    除国家进行优抚工作外，还应该保持和发扬“拥军优属”的优良传统；各地应该因地制宜地建立由代耕转到优待劳动日的一系列的办法。
    是一些什么问题呢？烈属、军属、残废军人过去一般都分有较好的土地，农业合作化以后，土地集体耕种，取消了土地报酬；合作社按劳取酬，而靠代耕优待的烈属、军属、残废军人都是劳动力不足或没有劳动力的人。虽然农业生产合作社示范章程上规定可以把应得的代耕的劳动日作为他们自己的劳动日；高级农业合作社章程规定合作社仍应按照国家规定的优待办法给以优待。但这毕竟是一件很大的变动，它不仅要各级工作人员特别是区乡工作人员懂得，而且要广大农民懂得。因为农村工作忙，我们也没有及时争取做好宣传布置，以致有些地方没有及时地把代耕改为优待劳动日，或是虽改为优待劳动日而改得不大恰当，影响到某些缺乏劳动力的烈属、军属、残废军人的一时的生活问题。比如，农业合作社生产增加，社员个人的收入随之增加，把代耕优待改为劳动日优待的烈属、军属、残废军人的收入也应随之增加，他们应该包括在百分之九十以上增加收入的社员之内。但是，这个意义直到八月一日人民日报的社论上才肯定下来，已经在夏收分配以后了。
    有人说：烈属、军属、残废军人的生活困难，应该完全由国家包下来，不要再由群众负担一部分。我们说：随着国家经济的发展，国家在优抚工作上多花一些钱是可以的。但完全包下来，不仅要受到财力限制，而且离开群众的帮助和妥善的安排劳动生产，要把几百万的烈属、军属、残废军人生产、生活上各方面的困难解决得很好，是不可能的。而且“拥军优属”是广大人民保卫祖国、军民团结一致的优良传统。我们应该保持和发扬这个传统。自然，某些合作社烈属、军属、残废军人特多的，政府仍应在优抚费中给以补助；某些烈属、军属、残废军人受劳动日优待后，仍有困难的，原定的生活补助的制度仍应执行。
    有的人说：优待劳动日是增加社的负担。我们说：这是由多年来实行的代耕办法转变来的，初级社把代耕日数转为优待劳动日，高级社把取消的土地报酬并到劳动日报酬之内，这并不是新增的负担。事实上，据很多地方调查，优待负担已比以前轻得多，而且还在逐年减轻。
    随着农业合作社的发展，农村优抚工作好做得多了，但目前还不能把这件事完全推给合作社。还要政府帮助、指导、检查，建立由代耕转到优待劳动日的、因地制宜的一系列的作法。
    进一步做好安置复员军人的工作
    内务部和各地民政部门应该深入检查，提出办法，妥善解决安置复员军人工作中存在的问题；各级党委、各个工作部门应该欢迎、关心和教育复员建设军人，使他们各得其所，人尽其才。
    复员军人已经成为工业、农业和其他事业建设中的积极因素，许多农村的政府、合作社的工作，都有复员军人参加，成为工作中的骨干；工业及其他事业中出现了许多复员军人的模范事迹。需要安置的复员军人，因为社会主义事业的发展，劳动就业的门路增多，安置比较容易。但有不少地方常常满足于百分之九十几的、大多数人得到安置，而忽视那些百分之几的不易于妥善安置的少数；少数地方和部门还存在着排斥、打击复员军人的现象。对已经安置的，在分配工作、确定待遇以及其他方面也还存在不少问题。对于这些问题，内务部和各地民政部门要深入检查，提出妥善办法。同时，这一工作又必须各级党委、各个工作部门坚决执行国务院关于安置复员建设军人工作的决议，欢迎他们、关心他们、教育他们，使他们各得其所、人尽其才，使他们在社会主义建设事业中发挥积极作用，不允许有任何忽视或歧视的现象。
    社会救济工作不能放松
    在农业合作社还没有能力完全实行“五保”的情况下，应该把国家的力量和群众的力量结合起来，解决缺乏劳动力的老弱鳏寡残疾者的生活问题。
    “老有所终，幼有所长，壮有所用，鳏寡孤独废疾者皆有所养”，这是我国古先哲人的理想；全国农业发展纲要（草案）上规定的保吃、保穿、保烧、保教、保葬等五保，是上述理想的实现。我党历来很注意此项工作，“解放区没有讨乞的”，久已传为美谈，今后定会做得更好。目前应注意的是在不少农业生产合作社力量还薄弱、公益金不多，还不能够完满地解决缺乏劳动力的老弱鳏寡残疾的人们的生活困难。我们不能忽视这种情况，以为一合作化，什么问题都解决了，放松政府的社会救济工作，以致这些人的生活困难问题得不到解决。在合作社还没有完全实行“五保”能力的情况下，必须用国家拨付的社会救济费予以补助，使国家的力量和群众的力量结合起来，解决这些人的生活问题。
    加强对民政工作的领导
    全国有烈属一百多万户，残废军人六十七万多人，复员军人五百多万人，还有军官和义务兵的家属，还有工作人员的退休待遇、工作人员死亡及其遗属的待遇，城乡贫困人民的救济，失业的救济，聋、盲、残废、疾病和一时遭遇不幸者的救济。总之，民政部门在这些方面事情还很多，并且伸入到社会的每一个角落。这些工作是社会主义建设中的重要部分，它虽然不能直接生产钢铁或粮食等等，但是却能够生产出巨大的政治鼓舞力量，能够提高广大群众建设社会主义和保卫社会主义的积极性。做好优抚、复员安置和救济工作，不仅进一步鼓励人民军队保卫祖国和平建设的意志和青年一代随时应征入伍的热情，而且使人民感到在我们的社会里，工作、生活都有保障，提高其忘我地献身于社会主义建设事业的情绪。
    指出这点之所以必要，是因为有些同志对这一点的认识不够。他们认为随着社会主义改造的胜利和社会主义建设的迅速开展，民政工作没什么可做了，做民政工作的人员没有前途了，有的要求转业。我们的答复是否定的。民政部门还有很多事，而且是很重要的事要做（除上述工作外，还有如救济灾荒、移民和其他工作），而且要有较多的能力强的而又善于动脑筋、掌握政策和深入群众的干部来做。
    有的地方忙于其他工作，民政工作常常排不到党政工作的议事日程上去；或者以为民政经费可以减少，常常不适当挪用或压缩，加以民政部门编制小、干部少，致使一些做民政工作的同志感到苦闷。对于这些问题，我们希望各级党政予以注意，并应加强对这个工作的领导。民政经费有的可以减少，有的则还要增加，因为项目增多，标准提高，在国家预算的比例上无疑是在下降，但绝对数则不仅不应减少，而且需要增加。民政工作人员的编制也需要适当的调整。
    以上意见如有不妥，请指正。
