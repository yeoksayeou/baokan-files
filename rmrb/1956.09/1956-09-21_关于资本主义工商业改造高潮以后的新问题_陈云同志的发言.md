Comrade Chen Yun's Speech on New Problems After the High Tide of Socialist Transformation of Capitalist Industry and Commerce

I agree with Comrade Mao Zedong's opening speech, Comrade Liu Shaoqi's, Comrade Zhou Enlai's, and Comrade Deng Xiaoping's reports, and I agree with the revised Party Constitution and the proposals for the Second Five-Year Plan.

Our socialist transformation has achieved great and decisive victory. In industry, handicrafts, agriculture and commerce, the socialist economy has already become the only important economic form. But the rapid transformation of large numbers of formerly non-socialist economic components into socialist economic components will inevitably bring us some new problems and new tasks. I would now like to express some opinions on the problems that have arisen in these non-socialist economic components, mainly capitalist industry and commerce, after the high tide of socialist transformation, including some problems that have arisen in state-owned enterprises as a result.

Work on Two Aspects: Capitalists and Employees

Our Party and government have been carrying out the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce for seven years. It will take several more years to complete this work, and many more tasks need to be carried out. After the implementation of joint state-private ownership in all capitalist industrial and commercial enterprises, the work we need to carry out includes the following three aspects: First, work on the capitalist side; second, work on the employee side; and third, transforming capitalist industry and commerce into socialist industry and commerce. We have already done a lot of work on the capitalist side, such as stipulating the amount of fixed interest, conducting inventory checks on enterprises, gradually arranging jobs for capitalist personnel, and gradually improving the relationship between public and private personnel within enterprises. For the employee side, we have promoted a group of outstanding employees to serve as public representatives in joint state-private enterprises. At the same time, we are drafting a wage plan to ensure that the wages of employees in joint state-private enterprises are not lowered if they are higher than the local wage standards for employees in state-owned enterprises, and are gradually increased if they are lower. However, it should be said that for more than half a year, the work we have done among employees in joint state-private enterprises has been insufficient, which is an oversight. Employees in joint state-private enterprises warmly support the implementation of joint state-private ownership, and they have generally launched labor emulation campaigns. However, due to the insufficient work we have done, some employees still have such questions: "Why have the powers of employees been reduced after the implementation of joint state-private ownership?" "Why do former capitalists still have positions and powers in enterprises today?" These questions from employees indicate that our work among the masses of employees has been insufficient and has shortcomings. The implementation of joint state-private ownership in capitalist enterprises is a fundamental change in the ownership of enterprises, and a change from capitalist ownership to basically socialist ownership. This change has altered the relationships in all aspects of joint state-private enterprises. After the Five-Anti Campaign against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state property, shoddy workmanship, and theft of state economic intelligence in 1952, workers' supervision of production was generally implemented in capitalist enterprises, and trade unions had very high powers in enterprise management. This method of workers' supervision of production was completely necessary before the implementation of joint state-private ownership, and was beneficial to the production and transformation of enterprises. After transforming capitalist enterprises into joint state-private enterprises, the task of the working class should be to further implement direct state management of production led by the working class, instead of simply supervising production. Of course, the state must rely on the masses of employees when managing these enterprises, must select experienced and outstanding individuals from the masses of employees to participate in leadership positions and other management positions, and must improve and resolutely implement various democratic management systems within enterprises. The transition from workers' supervision of production to joint management of production by workers and public representatives dispatched by state organs is not a reduction, but an increase in the management power of the working class in joint state-private enterprises; it is not a retreat, but an advance. The positions and powers of capitalist personnel in joint state-private enterprises today are fundamentally different from their positions and powers in private enterprises before the implementation of joint state-private ownership. The positions and powers of capitalists in capitalist enterprises before the implementation of joint state-private ownership referred to three powers: ownership of enterprise property, management power, and personnel allocation power. After the implementation of joint state-private ownership, because the ownership of property was not completely abolished, capitalists still receive certain interest for a certain period of time, but other than that, management power and personnel allocation power no longer belong to the capitalists, but to the state's specialized companies. The positions and powers of capitalist personnel in joint state-private enterprises are no longer the three powers before the implementation of joint state-private ownership, but a kind of ordinary engineering and technical personnel and management personnel powers granted to them by the state. This is not the power of capitalists, but the power of public servants. Do China's industrial and commercial capitalists possess knowledge of production technology and business management? It should be said that unlike the landlord class and bureaucratic capitalists, the vast majority of China's national capitalists have varying degrees of knowledge of modern production technology and business management. Their production technology and useful business management knowledge are what we need. Engineering and technical management personnel with a high degree of culture of the working class will surely grow up in the future, and have already begun to grow up. But as far as the current situation is concerned, the national bourgeoisie, including its intellectuals, is a class with a relatively high level of culture in China. It should be explained to all employees that it is unfavorable to the cause of the working class if the working class does not use this group of national capitalists who are willing to serve China's prosperity and powerful socialist country. It is in line with the interests of the working class to let them serve the production and management of socialist enterprises and to give them the same political rights as the people of the whole country. In order to make employees understand the changes in all aspects of capitalist enterprises after the implementation of joint state-private ownership, we should conduct a broad explanation to the masses of employees; continue to promote a group of employees with appropriate conditions to leadership positions in enterprises; the leaders of enterprises should pay attention to the democratization of management work; and pay attention to the necessary and possible improvement of the working conditions and living conditions of employees. As long as these tasks are done well, the doubts of some employees will be eliminated.

Some New Issues Regarding Enterprise Transformation

The above is the work on the two aspects of capitalists and employees. Now I want to talk about some new issues of principle significance regarding industrial and commercial management caused by the current transformation of capitalist industry and commerce.

First, after the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce has achieved a decisive victory, some measures taken by state economic departments in the past few years, especially in the past two years, to restrict capitalist industry and commerce have become unnecessary. These measures were necessary at the time and achieved results, but these measures are not only unnecessary today, but they were not without shortcomings at the time. If these measures continue to be taken at present, they will inevitably hinder the further development of the national economy.

What kind of measures are these referring to? (1) State-owned commerce implemented the method of processing and ordering and unified purchase and marketing for capitalist industry. This was necessary in the past, and will still be necessary for important light industrial products in the future in order to ensure supply and stabilize the market. But taking this method without distinction makes some factories less concerned about the quality of goods than when they sold them themselves, thus hindering the improvement of the quality of some industrial products. (2) Under the conditions of implementing processing and ordering and unified purchase and marketing, state-owned wholesale companies had to largely implement the method of allocating goods from top to bottom. The work of ordering goods from factories was concentrated in a few wholesale companies, and grassroots stores could not directly purchase goods from factories according to the needs of consumers. Therefore, the variety and specifications of goods ordered by commercial departments from factories were reduced. It was inevitable that the varieties and quantities of goods sent by state-owned wholesale companies to various places would not meet local needs, thus causing some phenomena of stockpiling here and shortages there. (3) Market management measures restricted the procurement and transportation of private merchants. These measures have made agricultural products and agricultural by-products virtually exclusively purchased by local supply and marketing cooperatives or state-owned commerce, without the competition of other purchasing units. Therefore, when supply and marketing cooperatives and state-owned commerce did not pay attention to purchasing certain agricultural products and agricultural by-products or the purchase price was too low, the production of these agricultural products and agricultural by-products would decrease.

Secondly, in the high tide of socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce, some temporary and local errors have also occurred due to the too rapid development of the situation and the difficulty in fully keeping up with the specific organizational guidance work, which must be quickly corrected at present. These errors are: (1) In the process of cooperation of handicrafts, too much merger and unified calculation of profits and losses were implemented, which was not conducive to the operation of handicrafts. Therefore, the quality of some handicraft products declined and the variety decreased compared with the time when they were self-employed; some service handicrafts experienced many inconveniences for residents and handicraftsmen themselves under the conditions of merger operation. (2) Some blind mergers also occurred in the transformation of capitalist industry and commerce in the high tide, which produced problems similar to the blind mergers of handicrafts. (3) In the process of agricultural cooperation, not enough attention was paid to the side occupations that should be operated by the family members of the cooperative, coupled with other aspects of influence, the production of some agricultural by-products declined somewhat. All these errors are temporary and local, some have been corrected, and some still need to be corrected.

In order to change the measures taken in the past to restrict capitalist industry and commerce, and to effectively correct some errors that occurred due to lack of experience in the process of socialist transformation, what measures should we take now? I. Change the Purchase and Sales Relationship Between Industrial and Commercial Enterprises

The first measure: We should change the purchase and sales relationship between industrial and commercial enterprises. The method of processing and ordering implemented by commercial departments for factories should be changed to the method of factories purchasing raw materials and selling goods. The purchase of factory products by commercial departments should take the following two methods: (1) For products related to the national economy and people's livelihood and simple specifications, such as cotton yarn, cotton cloth, coal, sugar, etc., unified purchase and marketing should continue to be implemented in order to ensure supply and stabilize the market. (2) For a wide variety of daily necessities, the method of unified purchase and marketing should be gradually stopped and replaced by the method of selective purchase, which is to roughly restore the method before the winter of 1953 on the new socialist economic foundation. For commodities that are selected for purchase, commercial departments have the right to give priority to the selection of purchase; commodities that are not selected and remain after the selection can be sold by the factory itself or sold by the commercial department on consignment. When commercial departments supply factories with raw materials, they cannot take the method of matching good and bad. Except for certain raw materials that are in short supply and can be allocated by the state, other raw materials can be freely selected and purchased by factories. Higher-level commercial wholesale companies are not allowed to allocate goods to lower levels, and lower-level stores can freely select and purchase from any wholesale organization in the country, and can also directly select and purchase from factories. The purpose of adopting this selective purchase method between industry and commerce and between the upper and lower levels of commercial organizations is to make factories concerned about the sales of products and improve quality, and to make stores adapt to the needs of customers without reducing the variety of goods. This selective purchase method is also suitable for many handicraft products.

II. It is necessary to preserve a certain amount of decentralized production and decentralized management

The second measure: A large part of industrial, handicraft, agricultural by-products and commerce must be produced and managed in a decentralized manner. The phenomenon of blind centralized production and centralized management from a one-sided point of view must be corrected.

Some of the joint venture factories should be merged and centrally produced. But as far as the whole country is concerned, most of them must be produced and managed in a decentralized manner according to the original situation or with necessary adjustments. The vast majority of joint venture factories are factories that manufacture daily consumer goods. People's needs for daily consumer goods are diverse and constantly changing. If many small factories are merged into large factories, they will not be as flexible in adapting to market needs as when small factories are produced in a decentralized manner. Taking dyed cloth as an example, in small machine dyeing factories, a variety can only dye fifty or sixty pieces of cloth, so it can change colors and varieties at any time to meet the needs of the people. However, large machine dyeing factories have large projects to change production procedures, so each variety must dye at least three hundred to five hundred pieces of cloth. If China's small factories are all merged into large factories, it will never be able to meet the diverse and constantly changing needs of people's consumption. It should be seen that before liberation, the colors and varieties of consumer goods in China were no less than they are now, but most of the factories that manufactured these consumer goods were small factories. Some comrades believe that merging small factories into large factories will increase output, so they wholeheartedly merge factories. We need a certain number of large factories, because many of the most important industrial products must be produced on a large scale. However, the reason why the output of many daily consumer goods factories has increased after the merger is mainly the result of reducing the variety and specifications of commodities and simplifying products. This "rationalization" cannot meet the needs of people's consumption, so we should not encourage this wrong merger.

Among the manufacturing industries of handicrafts, some can be appropriately merged, but the vast majority of service industries and many manufacturing industries should not be merged. In order to overcome the shortcomings of product simplification and declining service quality caused by blind mergers and blind implementation of unified calculation of profits and losses, many large cooperatives must be changed into small cooperatives, and the unified calculation of profits and losses by the whole cooperative must be changed to each cooperative group or each household being responsible for its own profits and losses. This change is not only suitable for the vast majority of service industries, but also for many manufacturing industries. Because handicrafts generally have decentralization and locality, in terms of supply and marketing business, basic-level cooperatives must be the main force in self-purchase and self-sale. The central and provincial and municipal handicraft leading organs and the federations of most industries can only guide the principles and policies, and should not operate their own import and export business.

In the commercial sector, those that are merged too much must also be appropriately decentralized. The method of small merchants and peddlers operating independently within the cooperative group should be preserved for a long time. Several state-owned wholesale companies, such as department stores, cultural goods companies, etc., should call back many of the original private wholesale commercial personnel who have changed their careers in various industries under their jurisdiction, and establish wholesale stores in separate branches and industries within the state-owned wholesale companies, so that the current state-owned wholesale companies such as department stores and cultural goods companies are too coarsely divided and lack expertise, which can be gradually overcome. In order to meet the needs of factories, stores, cultural and educational departments, and other institutions for a wide variety of imported goods, the Ministry of Foreign Trade should organize import stores in separate branches and industries according to their past and possible business operations for import firms that were originally private merchants and have now been jointly operated by state and private enterprises. And call back a part of the professional personnel who used to operate all kinds of imported goods in foreign merchants' foreign firms to participate in the work of these import stores. It is necessary to change the current phenomenon that several state-owned import companies are too inclusive of all imported goods, lack expertise, and cannot meet social needs.

The grain, cash crops and some side occupations of agricultural production cooperatives must be collectively operated by the cooperatives, but many side occupations should be operated by the members in a decentralized manner. The phenomenon of all operations being indiscriminately managed by the cooperative must be changed. Many side occupations can only increase the production of various side products, meet the needs of the market, and increase the income of the members by letting the members operate in a decentralized manner. In places where each member has a relatively large average area of land, as long as it does not harm the production of the main agricultural products of the cooperative, consideration should be given to whether the members can have more private plots so that they can plant feed and other crops to raise pigs and increase side products.

At present, the reorganization of capitalist industry and commerce is starting, and the collective and decentralized operation of industry and commerce and agriculture is being arranged. We must promptly correct the mistake of only paying attention to centralized production and centralized management while neglecting decentralized production and decentralized management. Otherwise, some problems that have already appeared in production, circulation, and service to consumers will continue to develop.

III. Change Market Management Methods

The third measure: We must abolish the methods in the market management methods that were originally stipulated to restrict the speculative activities of capitalist industry and commerce. In order to control food, cash crops and various agricultural products, and to prevent capitalist speculation, the state restricted private merchants from purchasing in the primary market in the past, which was necessary. In the future, for food, cash crops, and important agricultural and sideline products, the state still needs to purchase them in a unified manner or entrust the supply and marketing cooperatives to purchase them in a unified manner. However, for some agricultural and sideline products, such as small local products, which are now exclusively purchased by the local supply and marketing cooperatives in a unified manner, it should be changed to allow state-owned stores, cooperative stores, cooperative groups, and supply and marketing cooperatives in various places to freely purchase and transport them, and prohibit mutual blockades. In this way, those small local products can avoid being reduced in production due to the local supply and marketing cooperatives not paying attention to the purchase or the purchase price being too low, and the goods can be smoothly circulated. If everyone competes to purchase and the supply cannot meet the demand, the source of goods should be distributed according to the urgency of the needs of each unit under the leadership of the local party and government. If the supply is temporarily greater than the demand and each purchasing unit attempts to lower the price, the supply and marketing cooperative should purchase at the normal price as usual, so that farmers are not subject to the loss of price reduction. In order to meet the needs of free purchase and free transportation, the parts of the industrial and commercial management methods that are no longer applicable today must be changed. The mechanical restrictions in the bank remittance payment method that "the money for buying vinegar is not allowed to buy soy sauce" and the money remitted to A is not allowed to be used in B must be changed. The restrictions stipulated by the tax, transportation, and postal departments in the past in order to prevent speculative activities in terms of taxation, transportation of goods, and mailing of goods should be changed according to the new situation to activate the exchange of goods.

IV. Price Policy Should Be Conducive to Production

The fourth measure: We must make our price policy conducive to production. Since March 1950, the government has slightly increased the purchase price of agricultural products, and the selling price of industrial and agricultural products in the market has been generally stable. Such a price policy is correct, and it has played a beneficial role in promoting the development of industrial and agricultural production in China. Our purchase price for major agricultural products is appropriate, but the purchase price for some agricultural products is too low, which hinders production and should be adjusted. After changing from processing and ordering to factories purchasing raw materials and selling products, the parts of industrial products with low purchase prices will also be adjusted. At present, there is a phenomenon in China's price policy that is not conducive to production, that is, in terms of selling prices, stabilizing prices is simply regarded as "unifying prices" or "freezing prices." Therefore, the price difference between products of different qualities is very small, and high quality cannot get high prices. This price policy cannot encourage the improvement of product quality, but can only encourage the decline of product quality. The negotiated price method in China's market management once played a role in preventing private merchants from raising prices. Before March 1950, China had experienced twelve years of inflation and price fluctuations, so it is completely understandable that the people of the whole country are afraid of price fluctuations and demand price stability. But we must see that an inappropriate price policy will inevitably be detrimental to production. Therefore, we should not be afraid of temporary price increases within a certain range for the following three situations. These three situations are: (1) Due to pricing according to quality, the price of products with excellent quality and high cost should be appropriately increased. It should be seen that the decline in the quality of goods is the biggest price increase. For example, if a light bulb that should be used for one year can only be used for three months due to the decline in quality, its price has actually increased three times. In today's situation where the quality of some consumer goods has declined, advocating high quality and high price is actually reducing prices. (2) New products in consumer goods, because the cost is high when they are first made, as long as consumers are willing to buy them, they should be allowed to increase the price to a certain extent compared to the same products during the initial sales period. After mass production and cost reduction, the price will be reduced according to the possible situation. At a time when the varieties and specifications of some consumer goods are reduced, if this policy is not adopted, it will not be possible to encourage the increase of new varieties of consumer goods. (3) After relaxing market management for a part of small local products and changing to free purchase and free transportation, the purchase price will also increase in the initial period, so the selling price in cities cannot but be increased accordingly. It should be seen that if the policy of free purchase and free transportation is not adopted and the local supply and marketing cooperatives or state-owned commerce continue to be the sole purchaser, then many small local products will be reduced in production. If the small local products needed by the city cannot meet the demand and the government cannot allocate them, then people who need small local products will raise prices and purchase them in the market. Doesn't the sharp rise in the price of several kinds of traditional Chinese medicine prove this situation? Therefore, the increase in the selling price of a part of small local products in the city from free purchase and free transportation is a temporary phenomenon, and we can still constrain the degree of increase. This price increase will promote the increase in the production of small local products, and after the supply and demand are balanced, its price will fall back to the normal level. We should adopt free purchase and free transportation, and not be afraid of a certain degree of price increase in the short term. We must avoid the skyrocketing caused by reduced production. It should be seen that the selling price must obey the purchase price, and only mass production can maintain the stability of the price.

People will worry about whether prices can still remain stable after China adopts the above price policy and selects and purchases daily necessities. We believe that it can remain stable. We still purchase and sell food, cloth, etc., which are necessities of people's lives in a unified manner. The total output value of small local products that are allowed to be freely purchased and freely transported is only 4 billion yuan, the daily necessities that are prepared to be selected and purchased are only 4 billion yuan, and the selected purchase and self-sale of handicraft products are only 4 billion yuan. All these commodities of about 12 billion yuan account for only a little more than a quarter of the total retail sales of 46 billion yuan this year. Almost three-quarters of the important commodities are purchased and sold by the state. Moreover, before 1954, most of the 4 billion yuan of small local products and 4 billion yuan of daily necessities prepared for selective purchase were operated by private merchants. The 4 billion yuan of handicraft products have always been freely sold by handicraftsmen until the cooperation of handicrafts this spring. Since we were able to stabilize prices before 1954, how can we not be able to stabilize prices after all capitalist industry and commerce have implemented joint state-private ownership, most of handicrafts and small vendors have implemented cooperation, and the strength of the socialist economy has been greatly strengthened? We think it is definitely not like this. We can completely maintain the stability of prices.

V. Appropriately Change the Methods of Plan Management

The fifth measure: The methods of state plan management for certain means of production should be appropriately changed. Our national plans, whether long-term plans or annual plans, only include individual varieties of daily necessities, handicrafts, and small local products in the national plan. In addition, almost all do not stipulate product variety plans, which is appropriate. But the national plan stipulates the annual output value for these products, and stipulates the rate of cost reduction, the rate of increase in labor productivity, and the amount of profit to be turned over for the production departments of daily necessities. The basis for all these provisions is not accurate, and most of them are estimated. But because the national plan stipulates the indicators of these items, and these indicators are passed down level by level, and because the products of the factory are sold by commercial departments, the factory's production often only cares about completing the output value and profit, but does not pay enough attention to whether the commodity meets the needs of the market. We should regard the various indicators of these products in the national plan only as a reference indicator, so that factories that produce these daily necessities can set their own indicators and conduct production according to market conditions, without being bound by the national reference indicators, and pay the profits that should be paid according to the actual results at the end of the year. As long as the enterprise expenses strictly abide by the state's financial system, paying profits according to the actual results at the end of the year will not cause losses to the state. In view of the fact that the national plan does not need to stipulate many strict indicators for many factories and commercial departments, in addition to the necessary statistics, it should not waste money and effort to count many useless figures, which can greatly reduce the number of statistical personnel. At present, many personnel in these departments are spending labor on statistical figures that are not very useful.

We need such a socialist market

We want to transform capitalist industry and commerce into socialist industry and commerce. But what principles should we follow to guide the production and operation of these enterprises? We should not let the quality of consumer goods decline, the variety and specifications of commodities decrease, the production of agricultural and sideline products decrease, and the quality of service in the service industry decline; on the contrary, we must improve the quality of consumer goods, increase the variety, expand the output of industry and agriculture, and make the service industry provide attentive service. The purpose of adopting the above five measures is to transform China's capitalist industry and commerce into a socialist industry and commerce that is beneficial to the people.

Will adopting selective purchase and self-sale for some commodities, allowing many small factories to produce independently, dividing many handicraft cooperatives into smaller ones, decentralizing operations by group or household, allowing individual members of agricultural cooperatives to operate many sideline products, opening up the market management of small local products, not being afraid of temporary price increases of some commodities within a certain range, and changing the methods of plan management for certain departments, all lead to the risk of China's market returning to the capitalist free market? Definitely not. The result of adopting the above measures will definitely not be a capitalist market in China, but a socialist market that is suitable for China's situation and the needs of the people. The situation of our socialist economy will be like this: In terms of industrial and commercial production and operation, state operation and collective operation are the main body of industry and commerce, but there is a certain number of individual operations attached. This individual operation is a supplement to state operation and collective operation. In terms of the planning of production, the main part of the country's industrial and agricultural products is produced according to the plan, but at the same time, a part of the products is freely produced according to market changes within the scope permitted by the national plan. Planned production is the main body of industrial and agricultural production, and free production within the scope permitted by the national plan according to market changes is a supplement to planned production. Therefore, this socialist economic market is definitely not a capitalist free market, but a unified socialist market. In the unified socialist market, the state market is its main body, but there is a free market under state leadership attached within a certain range. This free market is under the leadership of the state and serves as a supplement to the state market, so it is a component of the unified socialist market.

Adopting the above measures can help us solve some problems existing in the national market at present. But at the same time, it should be seen that these measures will also bring some new problems that need to be further solved. In this regard, we still lack the necessary experience. Therefore, these measures we have said must be carried out cautiously, steadily, and gradually promoted after experimentation.

    关于资本主义工商业改造高潮以后的新问题
    陈云同志的发言
    我同意毛泽东同志的开幕词，同意刘少奇同志、周恩来同志、邓小平同志的报告，同意修改了的党的章程和第二个五年计划的建议。
    我国的社会主义改造事业已经取得了伟大的决定性的胜利。无论在工业、手工业、农业和商业中，社会主义经济都已经成为唯一重要的经济形式。但是大量的原来的非社会主义的经济成分如此迅速地转变为社会主义经济成分，当然会带给我们一些新的问题和新的任务。我现在想就这些非社会主义经济成分，主要是资本主义工商业，在社会主义改造高潮以后所发生的问题，包括由此而来的在国营企业中所发生的一些问题，发表一点意见。
    对资本家和对职工两个方面的工作
    我们党和政府对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造工作，已经进行了七年，要完成这个工作，还需要几年时间，而且还要进行许多工作。资本主义工商业实行全行业公私合营以后，我们需要进行的工作有下列三个方面：一、对资本家方面的工作；二、对职工方面的工作；三、把资本主义工商业改造成为社会主义工商业。对于资本家方面，我们已经作了不少工作，如：规定定息的数额，对企业实行清产核资，陆续安排资方人员，逐步改进企业内部公私共事的关系等等。对于职工方面的工作，我们提拔了一批优秀的职工担任公私合营企业的公股代表，同时，我们正在拟制工资方案，使公私合营企业职工的工资与当地相同国营企业职工的工资标准比较起来，高的不降，低的逐步提高。但是应该说，半年多来，我们在公私合营企业职工中进行的工作是不充分的，这是一个疏忽。公私合营企业的职工是热烈拥护企业实行公私合营的，他们普遍开展了劳动竞赛。但是由于我们的工作做得不够，也有一部分职工还有这样的疑问：“在公私合营以后，职工的职权为什么反而降低了呢？”“过去的资本家，今天在企业中为什么仍然有职有权呢？”职工的这些疑问，说明了我们在职工群众中工作做得不够和工作有缺点。资本主义企业实行公私合营，是企业所有制的一种根本改变，是资本主义所有制基本上转为社会主义所有制的一种改变。这种改变，改变了公私合营企业中各个方面的关系。一九五二年反对行贿、偷税漏税、盗窃国家资财、偷工减料、盗窃国家经济情报的五反斗争以后，在资本主义企业中普遍实行着工人监督生产，工会对企业管理方面有很高的权力。这种工人监督生产的办法，在公私合营以前是完全必要的，对于企业的生产和改造是有利的。把资本主义企业转变为公私合营企业以后，工人阶级的任务，就应该由监督生产进一步地实行由工人阶级领导的国家直接管理生产。当然，国家在管理这些企业的时候，必须依靠职工群众，必须从职工群众中选拔有经验的优秀分子参加领导职务和其他的管理职务，必须健全和坚决执行企业内部各种民主管理的制度。由工人监督生产转变到由工人和国家机关所派的公股代表一起去管理生产，对于工人阶级在公私合营企业中的管理权力来说，不是降低，而是提高；不是后退，而是前进。资方人员今天在公私合营企业中的有职有权和公私合营以前在私营企业中的有职有权，也有了根本的差别。公私合营以前的资本主义企业中资本家的有职有权，指的是企业的财产所有权、经营管理权、人事调配权等三种权力。公私合营以后，因为没有完全废除财产所有权，因而资本家在一定时期内仍得到一定的利息，但除此而外，经营管理权和人事调配权，都已经不属于资本家，而属于国家的专业公司。公私合营企业中资方人员的有职有权，它的内容，已经不是公私合营以前的三权，而是国家给予他们的一种普通工程技术人员和管理人员的职权，这不是资本家的职权，而是公务人员的职权。我国的工商业资本家是否具有生产技术和经营管理的知识呢？应该说，不像地主阶级和官僚资本家一样，我国民族资本家中的绝大多数人，具有不同程度的近代生产技术和经营管理的知识。他们的生产技术和有用的经营管理知识，是我们所需要的。工人阶级自己的有高度文化的工程技术管理人员，今后一定会成长，而且现在已经开始成长。但是就目前情况来说，民族资产阶级包括它的知识分子是我国文化比较高的一个阶级。应该向全体职工说明：工人阶级不使用这批愿意为我国繁荣富强的社会主义服务的民族资本家，对于工人阶级的事业是不利的，让他们为社会主义企业的生产经营服务，给予他们像全国人民一样的政治权利，是符合于工人阶级利益的。为了使职工认识资本主义企业在公私合营以后的各个方面的变化，我们应该对职工群众进行一次广泛的解释；继续提拔一批条件适当的职工到企业的领导职位上来；企业的领导人员应当注意管理工作的民主化；注意职工的工作条件和生活条件的必要的和可能的改善。只要把这些工作做好，那么，一部分职工的怀疑是会消除的。
    关于企业改造方面的一些新问题
    上面所说的是对资本家和对职工的两个方面的工作。现在我要说一说当前资本主义工商业改造所引起的关于工商业管理的一些新的有原则意义的问题。
    首先，在资本主义工商业的社会主义改造取得了决定性的胜利以后，在过去几年中，特别是过去两年中，国家经济部门为限制资本主义工商业而采取的一些措施已经成为不必要了。这些措施在当时是必要的，收到了成效的，但是这些措施不但在今天已经不需要，而且它们在当时也不是没有缺点的，目前如果继续采取这些措施，就必然会妨碍国民经济的进一步发展。
    这是指一些什么样的措施呢？（一）国营商业对资本主义工业实行了加工定货、统购包销的办法。这在过去是必要的，在今后对于重要的轻工业产品也仍然是要统购包销的，但是无区别地采取这种办法，就使一部分工厂不像原来自销的时候那样关心商品的质量，因此，也妨碍了一部分工业品的质量的提高。（二）在实行加工定货、统购包销办法的情况下，国营批发公司的上下之间，也不能不大部分实行自上而下的派货。向工厂定货的工作集中于少数批发公司，基层商店不能根据消费者的需要，直接向工厂进货。因此，商业部门向工厂所定货物的品种规格减少了。国营批发公司发到各地的商品的品种和数量，就难免发生一些不合当地需要的情况，因而发生一些这里积压、那里脱销的现象。（三）市场管理办法限制了私商的采购和贩运。这些办法使农产品、农业副产品实际上成为由当地供销合作社或国营商业独家采购，而没有另外采购单位的竞争。因此，当着供销合作社和国营商业对于某些农产品、农业副产品没有注意收购或者收价偏低的时候，这些农产品和农业副产品就会减产。
    其次，在农业、手工业、资本主义工商业的社会主义改造高潮中，由于形势发展太快，具体的组织指导工作不容易完全跟上，也产生了一些暂时的、局部的错误，目前必须迅速加以纠正。这些错误是：（一）手工业在合作化的过程中，过多地实行了合并和统一计算盈亏，而这是不利于手工业的经营的。因此，一部分手工业产品发生了比自营时候质量下降、品种减少的现象；一部分服务性的手工业在合并经营的条件下，对于居民和手工业者自己都发生了许多不便。（二）资本主义工商业在改造高潮中也发生了一些盲目合并的现象，同手工业的盲目合并产生了类似的问题。（三）农业在合作化的过程中，对于应该由社员家庭经营的副业注意不够，再加上其他方面的影响，一部分农业副产品的生产有些下降。所有这些错误，都是暂时性的，局部性的，有些已经纠正了，有些还需要继续纠正。
    为了改变过去为限制资本主义工商业所采取的措施，和有效地纠正在社会主义改造过程中由于缺乏经验而发生的一些错误，我们现在应该采取那些措施呢？一、改变工商企业间的购销关系
    第一个措施：我们应当改变工商企业之间的购销关系。应当把商业部门对工厂所实行的加工定货办法，改为由工厂购进原料、销售商品的办法。商业部门对工厂产品的采购，采取下列两种办法：（一）对有关国计民生和规格简单的产品，如棉纱、棉布、煤炭、食糖等等，继续实行统购包销，以便保证供应、稳定市场。（二）对品种繁多的日用百货，逐步停止统购包销而改用选购办法，这就是在新的社会主义经济基础上，大体恢复一九五三年冬季以前的办法。凡属选购的商品，商业部门有权优先选购；没有选购和选剩的商品，可以由工厂自销或者委托商业部门代销。商业部门供应工厂原料的时候，不能采取好坏搭配的办法。除某些供不应求的原料可由国家分配以外，其他原料由工厂自由选购。上级商业批发公司不准向下面派货，下级商店可以向全国任何批发机构自由选购，也可以向工厂直接选购。工业商业之间和商业的上下层机构之间采取这种选购办法的目的，是为了使工厂关心产品的销路而提高质量，为了使商店适应顾客的需要，而不减少商品的花色品种。这种选购办法，同样适合于许多手工业产品。
    二、必须保存一定数量的分散生产和分散经营
    第二个措施：工业、手工业、农业副产品和商业的很大一部分必须分散生产，分散经营。必须纠正从片面观点出发的盲目的集中生产、集中经营的现象。
    合营工厂中有一部分是应该合并和集中生产的。但是就全国来说，大部分必须按照原来的状况或加以必要的调整后分散生产，分散经营。绝大多数合营工厂是制造日用消费品的工厂，人民对日用消费品的需要是多样的，经常变化的。如果把许多小工厂合并成为大工厂，就它们适应市场需要来说，不会有小工厂分散生产的时候那样灵活。以染色布为例，在小的机器染厂里一个品种可以只染五、六十匹布，因此随时可以改变花色品种，适应人民需要。但是大型机器染厂改变生产程序的工程大，因此每个品种至少要染三百到五百匹布。如果我国的小工厂统统并成大工厂，那就决不能适应人民消费方面的多种多样和经常变化的需要。应该看到，解放以前，我国消费品的花色品种不比现在少，但是制造这些消费品的工厂，绝大部分是小工厂。有些同志认为，把小工厂合并成为大工厂，产量就会提高，因此，他们一心一意地合并工厂。我们需要一定数量的大工厂，因为许多最重要的工业产品是必须大规模生产的。然而，许多日用消费品工厂，并厂以后产量的所以提高，主要地是商品品种规格减少、产品单纯的结果。这种“合理化”不能适应人民消费的需要，因此，我们不应当鼓励这种错误的合并。
    手工业的制造性行业中，有一部分是可以适当合并的，但是绝大部分服务行业和许多制造行业不应该合并。为了克服由于盲目合并、盲目地实行统一计算盈亏而来的产品单纯化、服务质量下降的缺点，必须把许多大合作社改变为小合作社，由全社统一计算盈亏改变为各合作小组或各户自负盈亏。这种改变不但适合于绝大部分服务行业，而且适合于许多制造行业。因为手工业一般地带有分散性、地方性，因此，在供销业务上，必须以基层社自购自销为主。中央和省市手工业领导机关和多数行业的联合社，只能作方针政策的指导，不应该自己经营进销业务。
    商业方面合并得过多的，也必须适当分散。小商小贩在合作小组内的各自经营的办法，应该长期保存。若干国营批发公司，例如百货公司、文化用品公司等等，应该把所属的各行各业中许多已经改行了的原有私营批发商业人员，召集回来，在国营批发公司内部，成立分行分业的批发店，使百货公司、文化用品公司等等国营批发公司现在分工太粗、业务不精的现象，得以逐步克服。为了适应工厂、商店、文教部门、其他机关对于品种繁多的进口商品的需要，对外贸易部对于原系私商现已公私合营了的进口商行，应该按照他们过去经营和可能经营的业务，组织分行分业的进口商店。并且召集一部分原在外籍商人洋行中经营各色各样进口商品的专业人员，来参加这些进口商店的工作。必须改变目前几个国营进口公司过于统揽全部进口商品而业务不精、不能适应社会需要的现象。
    农业生产合作社的粮食、经济作物和一部分副业生产是必须由合作社集体经营的，但是许多副业生产，应该由社员分散经营。不加区别地一切归社经营的现象必须改变。许多副业只有放开手让社员分散经营，才能增产各种各样的副业产品，适应市场的需要，增加社员的收入。在每个社员平均占地比较多的地方，只要无害于合作社的主要农产品的生产，应该考虑是否可以让社员多有一些自留地，以便他们种植饲料和其他作物来养猪和增加副业产品。
    目前资本主义工商业的改组工作正在开始，工商业和农业的集体经营和分散经营正在安排。我们必须及时地纠正只注意集中生产、集中经营，而忽视分散生产、分散经营的错误。否则，在生产方面、流通方面、为消费者服务方面已经出现的一些毛病，就会继续发展。
    三、改变市场管理办法
    第三个措施：我们必须取消市场管理办法中那些原来为了限制资本主义工商业投机活动而规定的办法。国家为了掌握粮食、经济作物和各种农产品，为了制止资本主义的投机活动，过去限制私商在初级市场上的收购，这种限制是必要的。今后，对于粮食、经济作物、重要的农副产品，仍然需要由国家统购或者委托供销合作社统一收购。但是对于一部分农副产品，例如小土产，现在由当地供销合作社独家统一收购的，应该改变为允许各地国营商店、合作商店、合作小组和供销合作社一起自由收购、自由贩运，禁止互相封锁。这样就可以使那些小土产避免由于当地供销合作社不注意收购或者收价偏低而减产，可以使货畅其流。如果大家争购而供不应求的时候，则应当在当地党政领导之下，按照各个单位需要的缓急来分配货源。如果因为一时供过于求而各个收购单位企图压价的时候，供销合作社应该以正常价格照常收购，使农民不受压价的损失。为了适应自由收购和自由贩运的需要，工商管理办法中今天已经不适用的部分，都必须加以改变。银行汇款支付办法中，那种“买醋的钱不准买酱油”、汇到甲地的款不准在乙地使用的机械限制的办法，必须改变。税务、运输、邮务机关过去为了制止投机活动而规定的在税务方面、运输货物、邮寄商品方面的限制办法，应该根据新的情况加以改变，来活跃商品的交流。
    四、价格政策要有利于生产
    第四个措施：必须使我们的价格政策有利于生产。一九五○年三月以来，政府对农产品的收购价格是略有提高的，工农业产品在市场上的出卖价格是大体上稳定的。这样的物价政策是正确的，它对我国工农业生产的发展起了有益的促进作用。我们对主要农产品的收购价格是恰当的，但是有一部分农产品的收购价格偏低，妨碍了生产，应该加以调整。由加工定货改为工厂购进原料、销售产品以后，工业品中收价低了的部分，也将得到调整。目前在我国物价政策上存在着一种不利于生产的现象，就是出售价格方面，把稳定物价简单地看成是必须“统一物价”，或者“冻结物价”。因此不同品质的产品差价很小，优质得不到优价。这种价格政策，不能鼓励产品质量的提高，只能助长产品质量的下降。我国市场管理中的议价办法，曾经起过制止私商抬价的作用。一九五○年三月以前，我国经过十二年通货膨胀，物价波动，因此全国人民害怕物价波动，要求物价稳定，这是完全可以理解的。但是我们必须看到不适当的价格政策，必然不利于生产。因此我们对于下列三种情况，不要因为物价在一定范围内暂时上涨而有所恐惧。这三种情况就是：（一）由于按质论价，品质优良、成本较高的产品的价格，要适当地提高。应该看到，商品的质量下降是最大的涨价。例如本来应当使用一年的电灯泡，如果因为质量下降而只能使用三个月，实际上它的价格就涨了三倍。在某些消费品有质量下降现象的今天，提倡优质优价，实际上是降低物价。（二）消费品中的新产品，因为初制的时候成本高，只要消费者愿意购买，应该允许它在初销时期比之相同产品有一定程度的提价。等到成批生产而成本降低以后，再来根据可能情况加以降价。在现在某些消费品品种规格减少的时候，如果不采取这种政策，就不能鼓励消费品新品种的增加。（三）对于一部分小土产放松市场管理而改为自由收购自由贩运以后，在实行的初期，收价也会抬高，因而就不能不在城市中相应提高销价。应该看到，如果不采取自由收购，自由贩运政策，而继续让当地供销合作社或国营商业独家收购，那么，许多小土产会减产。如果城市所需要的小土产供不应求，政府又不可能配售，那么，需要小土产的人，就会在市场上抬价收购，现在若干种中药材的价格猛涨，不正说明这种情况吗？因此由自由采购、自由贩运而来的一部分小土产在城市销售价格方面的上涨，是一种暂时的现象，而且上涨的程度，我们仍然是可以约束的。这种价格上涨将促进小土产增产，等到供求平衡以后，它的价格就会回落到正常水平。我们应该采取自由采购自由贩运，而不要害怕价格方面一时的一定程度的上涨，我们必须避免那种因为减产而来的暴涨。应该看到销售价格必须服从收购价格，只有大量增产才能保持价格的稳定。
    人们会担心我国采取上述价格政策和对日用百货选购以后，物价是否还能保持稳定？我们认为可以保持稳定。人民生活必需的粮食、布匹等等，我们仍然统购统销。允许自由采购自由贩运的小土产的全部产值不过四十亿元，采取选购办法的日用百货不过四十亿元，手工业品的选购和自销部分也不过四十亿元，所有这一百二十亿元左右的商品不过占今年全国商品零售总额四百六十亿元的四分之一略多一点，几乎四分之三的重要商品都由国家收购和销售。而且四十亿元小土产和四十亿元准备选购的日用百货在一九五四年以前绝大部分就是由私商经营的。四十亿元手工业产品则直到今年春季手工业合作化以前，历来就是由手工业者自由销售的。一九五四年前，我们既然能够稳定物价，难道在资本主义工商业全部实行了公私合营，手工业和小商贩绝大部分实行了合作化，社会主义经济力量大大加强以后，反而不能稳定物价？我们以为决不是这样。我们完全可以保持物价的稳定。
    五、适当改变计划管理的方法
    第五个措施：对某些生产品的国家计划管理的方法，应该有适当的变更。我们的国家计划，无论长期计划或者年度计划，对于日用百货、手工业品、小土产，都只是把个别品种列入国家计划。此外，几乎全部不规定产品品种计划，这种办法是恰当的。但是国家计划对这些产品规定了每年的产值，对日用百货的生产部门，规定了降低成本率，提高劳动生产率，利润上缴额。所有这些规定的根据并不是确切的，绝大多数是估算的。但是因为国家计划规定了这些项目的指标，层层下达这些指标，又因为工厂的产品是由商业部门包销的，因此，工厂的生产就往往只顾完成产值和利润，而对于商品是否合乎市场的需要，却注意不够。我们应该把国家计划中对这些产品的各项指标只作为一种参考指标，让生产这些日用百货的工厂，可以按照市场情况，自定指标，进行生产，而不受国家参考指标的束缚，并且根据年终的实绩来缴纳应缴的利润。只要企业开支严格遵守国家规定的财政制度，那么按年终实绩来缴纳利润，并不会造成国家的损失。鉴于国家计划对许多工厂和商业部门不需要规定许多严格的指标，因此，除了必需的统计以外，不应该劳民伤财地去统计许多无用的数字，这样，可以大大减少统计人员。现在这些部门有许多人员，化费劳动于作用不大的统计数字。
    我们需要这样的社会主义的市场
    我们要把资本主义工商业改造成为社会主义工商业。但是，我们应该按照什么方针指导这些企业的生产和经营呢？我们不应该让消费品质量下降，商品品种规格减少，农副业产品减产，服务行业工作质量下降；相反，我们必须使消费品质量提高，品种增加，工农业产量扩大，服务行业服务周到。采取上述五项措施的目的，就是要把我国资本主义工商业改造成为这样一种有利于人民的社会主义工商业。
    对一部分商品采取选购和自销，使许多小工厂单独生产，把许多手工业合作社划小，分组或按户分散经营，把许多副业产品归农业合作社社员个人经营，开放小土产的市场管理，不怕有些商品的价格在一定范围内暂时上涨，改变对某些部门计划管理的方法，所有这些，是否将使我国的市场有退回到资本主义自由市场的危险性呢？决不会这样。采取上述措施的结果，在我国出现的决不会是资本主义的市场，而是一种适合于我国情况和人民需要的社会主义的市场。我们的社会主义经济的情况将是这样：在工商业生产经营方面，国家经营和集体经营是工商业的主体，但是附有一定数量的个体经营。这种个体经营是国家经营和集体经营的补充。在生产的计划性方面，全国工农业产品的主要部分是按照计划生产的，但是同时有一部分产品是按照市场变化而在国家计划许可范围内自由生产的，计划生产是工农业生产的主体，按照市场变化而在国家计划许可范围内的自由生产是计划生产的补充。因此，这种社会主义经济的市场，决不是资本主义的自由市场，而是社会主义的统一市场。在社会主义的统一市场里，国家市场是它的主体，但是附有一定范围内国家领导的自由市场。这种自由市场，是在国家领导之下，作为国家市场的补充，因此它是社会主义统一市场的组成部分。
    采取上述措施，可以帮助我们解决目前国家市场上存在着的若干问题。但是同时应该看到，这些措施也会带来一些新的问题，还需要进一步加以解决。在这一方面，我们还缺少必要的经验。因此，我们所说的这些措施，必须慎重从事，稳步前进，经过试验，逐步推行。
