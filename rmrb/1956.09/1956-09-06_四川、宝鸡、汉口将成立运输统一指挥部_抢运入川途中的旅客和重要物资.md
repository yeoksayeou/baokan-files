Xinhua News Agency, 5th: The Sixth Office of the State Council invited responsible persons from the Fifth Office of the State Council, the Ministry of Railways, the Ministry of Communications, the Ministry of Commerce, the Sichuan Provincial People's Committee, and other relevant departments on the afternoon of September 4 to hold a meeting to study emergency measures to solve the current tense situation of transporting materials into Sichuan.

    The meeting determined that passengers stranded en route and important materials awaiting shipment should be rushed as soon as possible. The priority is to rush the transport of daily necessities and gasoline related to people's lives. The specific method is to establish unified transportation headquarters in Sichuan, Baoji, and Hankou to strengthen transportation organization work. At the same time, it was suggested that the Ministry of National Defense borrow some vehicles from the Chengdu Military Region to support the Sichuan-Shaanxi highway transportation, and borrow large-horsepower transport ships from the Navy to strengthen the navigation capacity of the Sichuan River. In addition, it was also suggested that relevant units should no longer transport goods to Baoji before the Baoji-Chengdu Railway is officially open to traffic, and goods entering Sichuan should be transported by the Sichuan River as much as possible.

    As for the materials that are already stockpiled in Baoji and ready to be transported to Sichuan, the Ministry of Railways will still try to open temporary trains for transportation. The section between Fengxian and Yangpingguan (150 kilometers) of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway has very serious landslides and cannot be opened to traffic at present; this section will be transferred by automobiles. However, after this batch of stockpiled materials is transported, the Ministry of Railways will concentrate its efforts on improving the Baoji-Chengdu Railway in order to strive for its official opening as soon as possible.

    In addition to the current emergency measures to be taken, the meeting also discussed how to make the transportation industry suitable for the country's current and future transportation needs.

    四川、宝鸡、汉口将成立运输统一指挥部
    抢运入川途中的旅客和重要物资
    借调海军船舶和军用汽车加强水陆运输力量
    新华社5日讯　国务院第六办公室在9月4日下午邀集国务院第五办公室、铁道部、交通部、商业部、四川省人民委员会等有关部门的负责人，开会研究解决当前入川物资运输紧张问题的紧急措施。
    会议确定，要在最近抢运耽搁在中途的旅客和积压待运的重要物资。首先是抢运和人民生活有关的日用必需品和汽油。具体办法是在四川、宝鸡、汉口成立运输统一指挥部，加强运输组织工作。同时，建议国防部从成都军区借调一部分汽车支援川陕公路运输，从海军方面借调大马力的运输船舶加强川江航运力量。此外，还建议有关单位，在宝成铁路没有正式营业以前，不要再把货物运到宝鸡，目前入川的货物尽可能由川江航运。
    至于现在已经积压在宝鸡准备运往四川的物资，仍然由铁道部设法开临时列车运输。宝成铁路凤县到阳平关（一百五十公里）间因为坍方很严重，目前不能通车的那一段，用汽车转运。但是运完这一批积压的物资以后，铁道部将集中力量进行宝成路的改善工程，以便争取早日正式营业。
    除了当前所应采取的紧急措施以外，会议还讨论了怎样使运输业适合国家目前和将来的运输需要的问题。
