Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, September 5th: Egyptian Minister of Religious Endowments, Ahmed Hassan al-Baquri, called on Egyptian youth on September 4th to "take up arms to defend the motherland, Arabism, and Islam."

He said: "We will never give up the (Suez) Canal, because it is the means to our prosperity and the construction of the (Aswan) High Dam."

"We will continue our sacred march under the banner of our leader Nasser, who defends our cause against the imperialists."

At a large gathering of the newly formed Egyptian "National Liberation Army" forces, he also accused Britain and France of military buildup in Cyprus. He accused Britain, the United States, and France of "disguising themselves as defenders of freedom in all the wars they wage, using others as tools to achieve victory."

Ibrahim Tahawi, Secretary-General of the Liberation Congress Organization, then spoke at the meeting, saying: "Egypt is ready to crush any violation of its territory or any other Arab land..."

Tahawi warned the audience to guard against the "activities" of British and French agents. He pointed out that they "spread rumors and undermine the people's confidence in their cause."

He said that rumor-mongers must be punished with "the most severe means."

    埃及宗教基金部长
    号召青年拿起武器保卫祖国
    新华社5日讯　开罗消息：埃及宗教基金部长艾哈迈德·哈桑·巴库里9月4日号召埃及青年“拿起武器保卫祖国、阿拉伯主义和伊斯兰”。
    他说：“我们决不放弃（苏彝士）运河，因为它是我们繁荣和建筑（阿斯旺）高水坝的手段。”
    我们将继续在那在帝国主义者面前维护我们的事业的我们的领袖纳赛尔的旗帜下进行我们的神圣进军。”
    他在新成立的埃及“民族解放军”部队的大规模的集会上还指责英法在塞浦路斯进行军事集结。他指责英美法三国“在它们进行的所有战争中都伪装保卫自由，利用他人作为获得胜利的工具”。
    解放大会组织的秘书长易卜拉欣·塔哈维接着在会上讲话说：“埃及准备粉碎对它的领土或对任何其他阿拉伯国土的任何侵犯。……”
    塔哈维警告听众要防范英法两国特务的“活动”。他指出：他们“散布谣言和破坏人民对他们的事业的信心”。
    他说，必须用“最严厉的手段”惩处谣言贩子。
