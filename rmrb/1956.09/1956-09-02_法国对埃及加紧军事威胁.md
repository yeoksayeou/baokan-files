Xinhua News Agency, September 1st, Paris dispatch: The French government is stepping up military deployments, attempting to use military threats to force Egypt to yield on the Suez issue.

    The French Cabinet held a meeting on August 31 to discuss the Suez Canal issue. The meeting heard a report from Defense Minister Maurice Bourgès-Maunoury regarding the transfer of French troops to Cyprus. Sending French troops to Cyprus will be praised as a sign of a considered policy, a plan that is supposed to take effect when diplomatic efforts reach an impasse."

    According to reports, French troops and armaments are continuously arriving in Cyprus. The advance troops of the 7th Armored Division and the 10th Infantry Division have already landed in Cyprus.

    An Associated Press report stated: "More army, air force, and navy personnel are currently leaving France en route to Cyprus, where France's new forward position is 250 miles from the northern end of the Suez Canal."

    法国对埃及加紧军事威胁
    据新华社1日讯　巴黎消息：法国政府正在加紧进行军事调动，企图用武力威胁的办法来迫使埃及在苏彝士问题上屈服。
    法国内阁在8月31日举行了会议，讨论苏彝士运河问题。会议听取了国防部长布歇—莫努里关于法国军队调往塞浦路斯的报告。派遣法国军队到塞浦路斯去将被作为一种考虑过的政策的迹象而加以赞许，这个计划是要在外交方面陷于僵局的时候开始起作用。”
    据报道，法国的军队和军火正在陆续到达塞浦路斯。第七装甲师和第十步兵师的先遣部队已经在塞浦路斯着陆。
    美联社消息说：“更多的陆军、空军和海军目前已经离开法国在来塞浦路斯的途中，法国在这里的新的前沿阵地离苏彝士运河的北端二百五十英里。”
