Dear Comrades,

Our delegation brings fraternal greetings from the Communist Party of Ceylon and the working people of Ceylon to the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China.

We consider it an honor to attend this congress, which has attracted worldwide attention and expectations.

Friendly relations between China and Ceylon have existed since the first century AD. Historical records vividly illustrate the numerous cultural exchanges and trade that took place between our two countries in ancient times. The writings of Chinese scholars on Ceylon in the past have contributed to our understanding of the history of our era.

This valuable connection between our two countries was disrupted during the foreign imperialist rule of both China and Ceylon.

After China's liberation under the leadership of your Party and Ceylon's achievement of political independence, the friendly connections of the past have begun to be re-established.

Ceylon was one of the first countries to recognize the People's Republic of China, and it was also one of the first non-socialist countries to sign a trade agreement with your government.

The people of Ceylon are grateful for the many benefits derived from the Sino-Ceylon trade agreement signed in 1952. These agreements provided us with rice during a severe food shortage and helped us overcome the great crisis in our rubber industry, freeing us from the stranglehold of imperialist monopoly capital on our economy and trade.

These agreements are also an example of establishing cooperative and trade relations between countries with different social systems. Since the signing of these agreements, many countries—especially Asian countries—have signed similar mutually beneficial trade agreements with China.

The Communist Party of Ceylon is proud to have played a leading role in the mass movement that forced the former Ceylon government to sign these agreements despite significant pressure from the United States.

But despite these agreements, the former government, under pressure from the American imperialists, refused to develop diplomatic and friendly relations between our two countries. Against the will of the people of Ceylon, it sought to align our country with the British and American imperialist countries. Whether at the Bandung Conference or elsewhere, it engaged in provocations, attempting to undermine the unity of the Asian and African peoples in the struggle for peace and against colonialism.

The people of Ceylon responded to this treacherous and reactionary policy in the general election in April 1956. In this election, the people of Ceylon decisively defeated the former government party, restoring to power a government that pledged to pursue a policy of establishing diplomatic, trade, and friendly relations with socialist countries and maintaining world peace.

We are very pleased that, just as we are visiting here, an official delegation from the Ceylon government is also visiting. This delegation has just concluded a very valuable agreement with the Chinese government on the mutual exchange of diplomatic representatives, the expansion of trade, the development of economic and technical cooperation, and the strengthening of cultural relations between our two countries. This agreement is consistent in principle with similar agreements signed earlier this month between the Soviet Union and the Ceylon governments. We are confident that this agreement will greatly strengthen the long-standing friendship between the peoples of our two countries and further expand our country's trade with China, which already ranks third in Ceylon's foreign trade.

The discussions of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China are deeply concerned and noted not only by the Communists of Ceylon, but also by a very wide range of people in our country. The victory of the Chinese revolution under the leadership of your Party has deeply inspired them. Your achievements in the struggle to overthrow imperialism and feudalism and your rapid transformation of a backward country into a socialist country have increased the confidence of our people in solving our current problems and have provided valuable lessons.

Your victory in resisting imperialist aggression, your advocacy of the principle of peaceful coexistence, which is now accepted by most parts of the world, has made a great contribution to easing international tensions and strengthening world peace. The people of Ceylon greatly appreciate and support your efforts in this regard.

Your achievements in solving the problem of ethnic minorities are an example for Ceylon. In Ceylon, the failure to find a democratic way to resolve the national and cultural aspirations of the different parts of our people has seriously undermined the national unity that is extremely important for our progress.

Our delegation, on behalf of the Communist Party of Ceylon, expresses its gratitude to the Communist Party of China, because we have learned valuable lessons from the doctrines of your leaders and the historical experience of your Party. These lessons have helped a young party like ours to find the right direction and to formulate the correct policies for our country's struggle for independence and democratic progress.

Although defeating the former reactionary government of Ceylon was a great achievement, the task of achieving our complete independence and transforming our backward colonial economy into a progressive and national economy remains to be accomplished.

Our Party is now working to mobilize the people of Ceylon to accomplish these tasks, isolating and defeating the imperialist and domestic reactionary forces that are trying to make the current government follow the old path of the former reactionary government. The experience and achievements of your Party will be a valuable guide for us in accomplishing these tasks.

Our delegation will pay very close attention to the discussions of your Party's Eighth National Congress. This congress will move China further along the road to socialism, inspire other Asian countries, and strengthen the struggle to safeguard world peace.

Long live the friendship between the peoples of China and Ceylon!

Long live the fraternal ties and unity between the Communist Parties of China and Ceylon!

Long live the Communist Party of China!

Long live the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!

Long live the ever-victorious cause of Marxism-Leninism!

### 锡兰共产党代表团团长魏克马沁格同志致词

    锡兰共产党代表团团长魏克马沁格同志致词亲爱的同志们：
    我们代表团给中国共产党第八次全国代表大会带来了锡兰共产党和锡兰劳动人民的兄弟般的祝贺。
    我们认为能出席这次大会是一种光荣，这次大会已经引起了全世界的重视和期望。
    从公元一世纪起，中锡两国之间就已经有了友好的关系。历史的记载生动地说明我们两国之间在古代就进行了许多文化交流和贸易往来。从前中国学者关于锡兰的著作，对于我们了解我们这一时代的历史是有贡献的。
    我们两国间这种宝贵的联系在外国帝国主义统治中锡两国的时候便被破坏了。
    中国在你们党的领导下得到解放和锡兰取得了政治独立之后，从前那种友好的联系又开始重新建立起来。
    锡兰是最先承认中华人民共和国的国家之一，它也是非社会主义国家中最先同你们政府签订贸易协定的国家之一。
    锡兰人民感谢从一九五二年签订的中锡贸易协定所获得的许多好处。这些协定使我们在严重缺乏粮食的时候得到了大米，并且帮助我们渡过了我们橡胶工业的巨大危机，使我们挣脱了帝国主义垄断资本勒杀我国经济和贸易的毒手。
    这些协定也是不同社会制度的国家间建立合作和贸易关系的范例。自从签订这些协定以来，好些国家——特别是亚洲的国家已经和中国签订了类似的互利的贸易协定。
    锡兰共产党感到骄傲的是，它在迫使前任锡兰政府不顾美国的重大压力而签订这些协定的群众运动中起了领导的作用。
    但是尽管签订了这些协定，前任政府在美帝国主义者的压力下拒绝发展我们两国间的外交和友好关系。它违背锡兰人民的意愿，力图使我国和英美帝国主义国家站在一起。不管是在万隆会议上或是其他场合，它到处挑拨，企图破坏亚非人民在争取和平和反对殖民主义的斗争中的团结。
    锡兰人民在一九五六年四月间的普选中，对这种卖国的、反动的政策作了回答。在这次选举中，锡兰人民决定性地打败了前政府党，而使一个保证执行同社会主义国家建立外交、贸易和友好关系并且维持世界和平的政策的政府重新执政。
    我们很高兴，就在我们来这里访问的时候，锡兰政府的一个正式代表团也在进行访问。这个代表团刚刚同中国政府缔结了一项关于互派外交代表，扩大贸易，发展经济和技术合作以及加强我们两国文化关系的极有价值的协议。这个协议，同苏联和锡兰两国政府在本月初签订的类似的协议，在原则上是一致的。我们深信，这协议将大大地加强我们两国人民的悠久的友谊，进一步扩大我国同中国的贸易，中国在锡兰的对外贸易中已经占第三位。
    中国共产党第八次全国代表大会的讨论，不仅锡兰共产党人，而且我国极广泛阶层的人民也深切关怀和注意。在你们党领导下的中国革命的胜利深深鼓舞了他们。你们在推翻帝国主义和封建主义的斗争中所得到的成就和你们把原来落后的国家迅速地改造为社会主义的国家，使得我国人民在解决我们当前的问题方面增加了信心，取得了宝贵的教训。
    你们抵抗帝国主义侵略的胜利，你们对现在已为世界大部分地区所接受的和平共处原则的倡导，对于缓和国际紧张局势和加强世界和平作出了伟大的贡献。锡兰人民十分感谢和支持你们的这种努力。
    你们在解决少数民族问题方面的成就是锡兰的一个榜样。在锡兰，由于找不到一个民主的办法来解决我国不相同的各部分人民的民族和文化的愿望，因此使得对于我们的向前发展极为重要的民族团结遭到了严重的破坏。
    我们的代表团代表锡兰共产党对中国共产党表示感谢，因为我们从你们领袖的学说和你们党的历史经验中学到了宝贵的教训。这些教训帮助了像我们这样一个年青的党找到了正确的方向，定出了我国争取独立和民主进步的斗争的正确的政策。
    虽然打败锡兰前任反动政府是一个伟大的成就，但是使我们获得完全的独立和把我们落后的殖民地经济改造为进步的和民族的经济的任务，还有待我们去完成。
    我们党现在正致力于动员锡兰人民来完成这些任务，孤立和打败企图使现任政府走前任反动政府的老路的帝国主义和国内反动势力。你们党的经验和成就将是我们在完成这些任务方面的宝贵指针。
    我们代表团将极其密切地注意你们党的第八次全国代表大会的讨论。这次大会将使中国在走向社会主义的道路上更向前迈进，鼓舞其他亚洲国家，加强维护世界和平的斗争。
    中锡两国人民的友谊万岁！
    中锡两国共产党之间兄弟般的联系和团结万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    以苏联为首的社会主义阵营万岁！
    百战百胜的马克思列宁主义事业万岁！（附图片）
