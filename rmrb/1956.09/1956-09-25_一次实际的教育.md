    A Practical Education
    Speech by Comrade Jiang Hua, First Secretary of the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China
    I fully endorse Comrade Mao Zedong's opening address, and I fully agree with Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report, the new Party Constitution, Comrade Deng Xiaoping's report, the proposals for the Second Five-Year Plan, and Comrade Zhou Enlai's report.
    The Party Central Committee's political report summarizes the rich experiences of all aspects since the Seventh National Congress of the Party, and clearly and specifically points out the future work tasks. Practice has proven that the Party Central Committee's line during this period was completely correct. Now, based on Zhejiang Province's experiences in the agricultural cooperative movement, I would like to express some opinions on the issue of opposing subjectivism.
    After completing land reform, Party organizations at all levels in Zhejiang began to lead farmers in establishing agricultural production mutual aid organizations. Starting in the winter of 1951, we experimented with agricultural production cooperatives. After two major developments in 1954 and 1955, by the end of July this year, the number of farm households participating in agricultural production cooperatives had reached 97% of the total number of farm households in the province, of which the number of farm households participating in advanced agricultural production cooperatives had reached 63% of the total. It is expected that by the end of this year, the advanced form of agricultural cooperativization can be basically completed. Agricultural cooperativization has promoted the development of agricultural production. Although we suffered severe drought and continuous typhoon disasters this year, it is expected that we can still complete the state's First Five-Year Plan's grain production target for 1957. These facts prove that the Party Central Committee's policy of socialist transformation of agriculture is completely correct, and it reflects the fundamental demands of the people and the country's socialist industrialization.
    Thinking Lagged Behind Reality, and a Wrong Policy of "Resolutely Contracting" Was Once Adopted in the Cooperative Movement
    However, the development of Zhejiang's agricultural cooperative movement also suffered serious setbacks. In the spring of 1955, we committed a serious right-leaning conservative error and disbanded 15,000 cooperatives. This error centrally exposed our subjective idealism in thinking and bureaucracy in work in leading the agricultural cooperative movement.
    In the autumn of 1954, under the encouragement of the Party's general line during the transition period and the impact of the continuous production increases of more than 3,000 agricultural production cooperatives that had been established on a trial basis in the past few years, the situation of the agricultural cooperative movement underwent great changes. The vast numbers of poor peasants and new and old lower-middle peasants saw with their own eyes the superiority of the cooperatives in increasing production and resisting disasters, and had already determined that this was the only correct path. Therefore, in less than half a year, the number of cooperatives in the province developed to 53,000. However, because we did not conduct in-depth investigations into the changes in the rural class situation after land reform, and did not seriously study the ideological trends of the people of all classes in rural areas after the general line was publicized, our thinking lagged behind reality in the face of the rapid development of the objective situation. Originally, we only planned to develop from more than 3,000 cooperatives to 25,000. This plan was quickly broken through, but we did not keep up in time to proactively strengthen the leadership of the movement, which put our leadership in a passive position. As a result, some deviations occurred in the movement, causing various different discussions and debates within and outside the Party. Under these circumstances, instead of going deep into the masses and correctly answering these discussions and debates based on the true situation of the movement, we sat in the meeting room, leaving behind a comprehensive understanding and repeated study of the actual situation, and one-sidedly sought conclusions from books and narrow experiences. Thus, after seeing the wavering of some middle peasants, we believed that "60% to 70% of the peasants were wavering," and that such rapid development "surpassed the objective laws" and "surpassed the level of awareness of the masses"; after seeing some facts of coercion and commandism in the movement, we believed that such development had the danger of "damaging production" and "damaging the worker-peasant alliance." Since there would be such serious consequences if it continued to develop, then we could only quickly "dismount." Thus, the wrong policy of "resolutely contracting" was adopted, treating it as a magic weapon for saving danger, getting rid of passivity, and striving for initiative. This is the concrete manifestation of our subjective idealism in thinking methods.
    The bureaucratic style of work prevented us from correcting our mistakes in the practice of the masses. After the wrong policy of "resolutely contracting" was conveyed to grassroots organizations and the broad masses, it encountered a lot of resistance. However, because we had already subjectively framed a group of so-called poorly run cooperatives, and had already decided to disband this group of poorly run cooperatives. Therefore, we turned a deaf ear to the reasons for resisting the disbandment of cooperatives from the masses and grassroots cadres, and instead criticized their shortcomings in work, emphasizing the danger of production reduction if they continued to run, and forced them to mobilize members to transfer out and withdraw from the cooperatives. This wrong policy, coupled with the bureaucratic style, further expanded the harm of this error, severely frustrating the socialist enthusiasm of cadres and the masses, causing the rural work to lose its direction and causing confusion for a time.
    The Party Central Committee Corrected Our Mistakes in a Timely Manner, Party Organizations at All Levels Changed Their Leadership Style, Went Deep into Reality, Went Deep into the Masses, and Victoriously Led the Upsurge of the Agricultural Cooperative Movement in the Province.
    Not long after implementing this wrong policy, the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong promptly discovered and corrected our mistakes, and enabled the province's agricultural cooperative movement to quickly turn onto the road of healthy development. Comrade Mao Zedong's report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation" is the most powerful weapon for us to recognize and correct our mistakes and quickly achieve victory in the cooperative movement. It not only pointed out that the upsurge of the cooperative movement had arrived, and criticized our right-leaning conservative thinking that lagged behind reality; but also educated us with realistic and vivid materials that we must not relax our investigation and research of the actual situation for a moment in our leadership work; major issues must be repeatedly discussed with cadres and the masses, and their experience and creativity must be valued. Only by combining theory with practice and combining leadership with the masses can we stand in front of the movement and lead the movement forward. Otherwise, we will lose our direction and make mistakes.
    After seriously studying Comrade Mao Zedong's report, Party organizations at all levels in the province, on the one hand, recognized the seriousness of the mistakes they had made on the issue of cooperation and conducted open self-criticism from top to bottom, thereby eliminating the estrangement between superiors and subordinates and the feeling of mutual blame, and strengthening the Party's unity; on the other hand, they also realized that the main reason for their mistakes was being divorced from reality and being divorced from the masses, and began to change their style, attaching importance to going deep into reality to study objective situations and going deep into the masses to concentrate the experience of the masses.
    After the cadres went deep into reality and went to the masses, they discovered many facts of the masses relying on their own strength to run the cooperatives well; they discovered that some cooperatives, after being forced to disband, changed their names to mutual aid groups and still persisted in running, and were consolidated and achieved increased production; and that some cooperatives, after wealthy peasants withdrew, the remaining poor peasants and new and old lower-middle peasants were also able to overcome various production difficulties and run the cooperatives well. These facts, in turn, educated us and the leading cadres at all levels, and made us realize that Comrade Mao Zedong's analysis of the upsurge of the agricultural cooperative movement and the situation of various classes in rural areas was completely in line with the actual situation. This completely eliminated the original worries in the development of the movement and boosted the courage and confidence to boldly lead the movement.
    Because Party organizations at all levels and leading cadres at all levels in the province improved their understanding and changed their style, they not only victoriously led the upsurge of the agricultural cooperative movement in the province, but also discovered, in the process of going deep into reality and summarizing the advanced experience of the masses, that many cooperatives had created many good methods in production management, labor organization, financial accounting, and recording work points and remuneration. These good methods were precisely the problems that the cadres of a large number of newly established cooperatives and the broad masses of members were urgently demanding to solve. After summarizing these experiences from the masses and organizing them to be promoted, these problems that existed in the early stages of running the cooperatives were solved relatively smoothly. The upsurge of agricultural cooperativization brought about an upsurge in agricultural production. The demands of the masses have shifted to how to do a good job in production and increase income. The leading organs at all levels accepted the lessons and promptly grasped the leadership of the production movement. In leading production, we paid more attention to the leadership method of "from the masses, to the masses", and summarized a large number of advanced experiences in high unit area yields such as "thousand-jin grain" and "hundred-jin cotton". When promoting these experiences, we focused on analyzing the specific local conditions and found ways to increase production suitable for the local situation. In addition, these advanced experiences were widely exchanged through methods such as publishing in newspapers, publishing books, visits, organizing labor competitions, meeting introductions and awarding models, which greatly reduced commandism in the leadership of the agricultural production increase movement.
    In the process of making mistakes and correcting mistakes, we deeply realized how harmful the subjective idealism and bureaucratic style of thinking and working that does not investigate, does not study, and does not listen to the opinions of the masses is to the cause of the Party and the people, and also deeply realized the huge promoting effect of the style of combining theory with practice and combining leadership with the masses on the cause of the Party and the people. For us, the lessons are very profound.
    The mistakes we made on the issue of cooperativization have been corrected, but it does not mean that our subjective idealism and bureaucratic style of being divorced from reality and being divorced from the masses will not occur again. On the contrary, due to the great victories of the cooperativization movement and other tasks, an extremely dangerous sense of pride is growing within the Party. Therefore, the errors of subjectivism and bureaucracy have not only not been completely eliminated, but have also developed in some aspects. Obviously, in future work, if we are not vigilant, we may even make more serious mistakes. Therefore, we believe that the Party Central Committee's proposal to adopt the method of rectification, through study, improve understanding, link with reality, carry out criticism and self-criticism, and oppose subjectivism, bureaucracy and sectarianism within the Party is completely correct. As long as we can use the method of rectification well to correct our thinking, can systematically study Marxist-Leninist theory, adhere to the policy of combining theory with practice, and adhere to the work style of combining leadership with the masses, we will surely be able to build our country into a great socialist country under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and together with the people of the whole country.

    一次实际的教育
    中共浙江省委员会第一书记　江华同志的发言
    我完全拥护毛泽东同志的开幕词，我完全同意刘少奇同志的报告、新的党章和邓小平同志的报告、关于第二个五年计划的建议和周恩来同志的报告。
    党中央的政治报告，总结了党的第七次全国代表大会以来各方面的丰富的经验，并且明确地具体地指出了今后的工作任务。实践证明，这个时期党中央的路线是完全正确的。现在我根据浙江省在农业合作化运动中的体会，就反对主观主义问题发表一些意见。
    浙江各级党组织在完成土地改革以后，就着手领导农民建立农业生产互助组织。从一九五一年冬季开始试办农业生产合作社，经过一九五四年和一九五五年的两次大发展，到今年七月底，全省参加农业生产合作社的农户已占到农户总数的百分之九十七，其中参加高级农业生产合作社的农户已占到农户总数的百分之六十三。预计到今年年底，就可以基本上完成高级形式的农业合作化。农业合作化促进了农业生产的发展，今年虽然遭受了严重的干旱和连续的台风灾害，但预计仍然可以完成国家第一个五年计划规定的一九五七年的粮食生产任务。这些事实证明了党中央规定的农业社会主义改造的方针是完全正确的，它反映了人民群众和国家社会主义工业化的根本要求。
    思想落后于实际，在合作化运动中一度采取了“坚决收缩”的错误方针
    但是，浙江农业合作化运动的发展，也曾经受到过严重的挫折。一九五五年春季，我们犯了严重的右倾保守的错误，解散了一万五千个合作社。这个错误集中地暴露了我们在领导农业合作化运动中思想上的主观主义和工作上的官僚主义。
    一九五四年秋季，在党的过渡时期总路线的鼓舞之下，在过去几年来试办三千多个农业生产合作社不断增产的影响下，农业合作化运动的形势发生了很大的变化，广大贫农和新老下中农亲眼看到了合作社在增加生产、抵御灾荒中所表现出来的优越性，已经认定了这是一条唯一正确的道路。因此，不到半年的时间，全省合作社就发展到五万三千个。但是，由于我们没有深入调查土地改革以后农村阶级情况的变化，没有认真研究总路线宣传以后农村各阶层人民的思想动向，因而在客观形势突飞猛进的发展中，我们思想却落后于实际。原来我们只准备由三千多个合作社发展到二万五千个。这个计划迅速地被突破了，而我们还没有及时跟上去，主动地加强对运动的领导，这就使我们的领导陷入了被动。结果运动发生了一些偏差，在党内党外引起各种不同的议论和争论。在这种情况下，我们不是深入到群众中去，根据运动的真实情况，正确地回答这些议论和争论。而是坐在会议室里，离开对实际的全面了解和反复研究，片面地从书本上和狭隘的经验中去找结论。于是，在看到了某些中农的动摇以后，就认为是“百分之六十到七十的农民动摇”，就认为这样快的发展“超越了客观规律”，“超越了群众的觉悟水平”；看到了运动中某些强迫命令的事实以后，就认为这样发展有“破坏生产”、“破坏工农联盟”的危险。既然发展下去会有这样严重的后果，那就只有赶快“下马”。这样就采取了“坚决收缩”的错误方针，把它当作挽救危险和摆脱被动、争取主动的法宝。这就是我们在思想方法上的主观主义的具体表现。
    工作上的官僚主义作风，使我们没有能够在群众的实践中修正自己的错误。“坚决收缩”的错误方针，传达到基层组织和广大群众中去以后，曾经遇到过不少的抵抗。但是由于我们主观上已经框定一批所谓办不好的合作社，已经确定了把这批办不好的合作社加以解散。因此我们对于来自群众、来自基层干部的抵制解散合作社的理由充耳不闻，反而指责他们工作中的缺点，强调办下去有减产的危险，强迫他们发动社员转组退社。这个错误的方针加上官僚主义的作风，就更加扩大了这个错误的危害，以致严重地挫折了干部和群众的社会主义积极性，使农村工作一度迷失方向，引起了混乱。
    党中央及时纠正了我们的错误，各级党组织转变了领导作风，深入实际，深入群众，胜利地领导了全省农业合作化运动的高潮
    执行这一错误方针不久，党中央和毛泽东同志就及时地发现和纠正了我们的错误，并且使全省农业合作化运动迅速地转上健康发展的道路。毛泽东同志“关于农业合作化问题”的报告，是我们认识错误和纠正错误，并且迅速取得合作化运动胜利的最有力的武器。它不但指出了合作化运动的高潮已经到来，批判了我们思想落后于实际的右倾保守思想；而且以现实的生动的材料教育我们，在领导工作中一刻也不能放松对实际情况的调查研究；重大的问题必须和干部群众反复商量，重视他们的经验和创造，只有把理论和实际结合起来，领导和群众结合起来，才能站在运动的前面，领导运动前进。否则就会迷失方向，就要犯错误。
    全省各级党组织在认真地学习了毛泽东同志的报告以后，一方面认识了自己在合作化问题所犯的错误的严重性，进行了从上而下的、公开的自我批评，因而消除了上下级之间的隔阂和互相埋怨的情绪，增强了党的团结；另一方面，也认识了自己犯错误的主要原因是脱离实际和脱离群众，开始转变了作风，重视了深入实际研究客观情况和深入群众集中群众的经验。
    干部在深入实际和到群众中去以后，发现了许多群众依靠自己力量办好合作社的事实；发现有些合作社被强迫解散以后，改名为互助组，仍旧坚持办下去，并且巩固起来，获得了增产；也有些合作社在富裕农民退出去以后，留下的贫农和新老下中农也能克服生产上的各种困难，把合作社办好。这些事实，反过来又教育了我们和各级领导干部，认识了毛泽东同志指出的农业合作化运动的高潮形势和对农村各阶层情况的分析是完全符合实际情况的。这就彻底地消除了原来在运动发展中的那些忧虑，鼓起了大胆领导运动的勇气和信心。
    由于全省各级党组织和各级领导干部提高了认识，转变了作风，所以不但胜利地领导了全省农业合作化运动的高潮，而且，在深入实际，总结群众的先进经验中，发现了许多合作社在生产管理、劳动组织、财务会计、记工取酬等方面都创造了许多好的办法。这些好的办法，正是大批新办社的干部和广大社员迫切要求解决的问题。把群众中的这些经验总结起来，并且有组织地推广出去以后，就比较顺利地解决了办社初期所存在的这些问题。农业合作化的高潮，带来了农业生产高潮。群众的要求已转到如何搞好生产，增加收入的方面。各级领导机关接受了教训及时地抓紧了对生产运动的领导。在领导生产中，更注意了“从群众中来，到群众中去”的领导方法，总结了大量的“千斤粮”、“百斤棉”等高额单位面积产量的先进经验，在推广这些经验时着重分析当地具体条件，找到了适合于当地情况的增产办法。此外又通过登报、出书、参观访问、组织劳动竞赛、会议介绍和奖励模范等项办法，广泛地交流了这些先进经验，这就大大地减少了在领导农业增产运动中的命令主义。
    我们在犯错误和纠正错误的过程中，深刻地体会到不调查、不研究，不倾听群众意见的主观主义、官僚主义的思想方法和工作作风，对党和人民事业是如何有害，也深刻体会到理论与实际结合、领导与群众结合的作风对党和人民事业所起的巨大的促进作用。对于我们，教训是非常深刻的。
    我们在合作化问题上所犯的错误是纠正了，但决不是说我们脱离实际、脱离群众的主观主义、官僚主义作风就不会再产生了。恰恰相反，由于合作化运动和其它各项工作的巨大胜利，党内正滋长着一种极端危险的骄傲情绪。因此，主观主义、官僚主义的错误不仅没有完全消除，而且在某些方面又有所发展。很明显地，在今后工作中，如果我们不警惕，甚至还会犯更严重的错误。因此，我们认为党中央提出的采用整风的方法，通过学习，提高认识，联系实际，开展批评与自我批评，反对党内的主观主义、官僚主义和宗派主义，是完全正确的。只要我们能很好地运用整风的方法来改正自己的思想，能系统地学习马克思列宁主义的理论，坚持理论与实际相结合的方针，坚持领导与群众相结合的工作作风，我们就一定能够在党中央的领导下和全国人民一起，把我国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义国家。
