    Krasnoyarsk, Soviet Union
    Huge Aluminum and Iron Ore Deposits Discovered

    Moscow Dispatch from our Newspaper, September 11th: Last May, the Soviet Academy of Sciences sent an expedition to the Krasnoyarsk Krai in Siberia, planning to spend five or six years investigating and studying the region's productive forces, providing potential conditions for the development of heavy industry. During the investigation, they discovered extremely rich aluminum deposits in the area, which could become the world's largest aluminum smelting region. In the future, the cost of aluminum here will be half the cost of current factories, and investment is estimated to save hundreds of millions of rubles. They also discovered billions of tons of iron ore in the Priangarye region of the area, which can be mined by open-pit mining methods. In addition, the Krasnoyarsk Krai also has very rich coal deposits. It was already confirmed at the 17th International Geological Congress in 1937 that the coal reserves here are 400 billion tons. In the Achinsk and Kansk coal-producing areas, the coal reserves are almost equal to those of the Donbas region. The Abakano and Minusinsk coal-producing areas have a total of 20 billion tons of coal.

    苏联的克拉斯诺雅尔斯克
    发现巨大的铝铁矿藏
    本报莫斯科11日电　苏联科学院去年5月派了一个考察团到西伯利亚的克拉斯诺雅尔斯克边区，准备用五、六年的时间来考察和研究该区的生产力，提供发展重工业的可能条件。在考察中，他们发现该区蕴藏着极为丰富的铝矿，有可能成为世界上最大的炼铝区。将来这里铝的成本要比目前各工厂便宜一半，投资估计也可节省几亿卢布。他们在该区普利安加列还发现藏有几十亿吨铁矿，可以用露天采矿法开采。此外，克拉斯诺雅尔斯克边区的煤藏也甚为丰富。还在1937年举行的第十七次国际地质学会上就已确知这里的藏煤量为四千亿吨，在阿琴斯克、堪斯克产煤区，藏煤量几乎与顿巴斯相等，阿巴堪诺、米努辜产煤区的煤共有二百亿吨。
