Henan Xuchang Prefecture Properly Arranges Intellectuals in Rural Areas

(Our report) The counties and cities of Xuchang Prefecture, Henan Province, have conducted a comprehensive investigation and arrangement of intellectuals in rural areas. By the end of July, according to statistics from six counties and cities including Xuchang, Xiangcheng, Yancheng, Ye County, Yu County, etc., two thousand and ninety-seven intellectuals in rural areas had been placed; based on their own specialties, they were assigned to work in education, health, cultural institutions, and factories. After they went to their work posts, their morale was very high. For example, Comrade Wang Yujie of Ye County actively studied his profession after arriving at the Liancun Clinic and established a high prestige among the masses; Lou Zhi did a great job in running the canteen after taking on the general affairs work at the school. Both students and teachers were very satisfied. (Jin Tianduo)

    河南许昌专区妥善安排在乡知识分子
    本报讯　许昌专区各县市对在乡知识分子进行了全面的调查了解和安排。到7月底止，据许昌、襄城、郾城、叶县、禹县等六个县市统计，已安置了二千零九十七名在乡知识分子；根据他们本人的特长，分别安排到教育、卫生、文化机关和工厂里做工作。他们到工作岗位后，情绪都很饱满。如叶县王育杰同志，到廉村诊所后，积极钻研业务，在群众中树立了很高的威信；娄峙到学校担任总务工作后，把食堂办的很好，同学和教师都很满意。　（金天铎）
