    China's Territorial Sovereignty Is Inviolable
    Recently, this newspaper received many letters from readers expressing their indignation at the provocative actions of the Ngo Dinh Diem clique of South Vietnam in infringing upon our country's Nansha Islands. The following are excerpts from some of these letters:
    We Chinese youth love our great motherland and every inch of its land. We express our firm protest against the provocative actions of the Ngo Dinh Diem clique in infringing upon our country's Nansha Islands.
    Supported by U.S. imperialism, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique has long coveted our country's Nansha Islands. In June, they shamelessly declared that the Nansha Islands, a part of our territory, belonged to them. Obviously, this deliberately provocative excuse is not worth refuting. Recently, South Vietnamese troops even "secretly" climbed onto the Nansha Islands, planted their flags and boundary markers, attempting to seize our land.
    We will never tolerate the aggressive acts of the South Vietnamese authorities. The Nansha Islands are an inseparable part of our country. Just as U.S. imperialism cannot take away our Taiwan with warships and cannons, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique should not dream of "stealing" our Nansha Islands!
                  Chen Cong, Wang Wenxian, Zhang Shumei, Du Xin, Liang Lianlu
    Seeing the news that the Ngo Dinh Diem clique of South Vietnam had infringed upon our country's territory of the Nansha Islands, my heart was filled with anger.
    The Nansha Islands and the Xisha Islands are our country's sacred and inviolable territory. But there are such shameless elements who, with the support of their American masters, dare to send naval personnel to invade the Nansha Islands. This is a serious provocation against the 600 million Chinese people and a serious provocation against peace in Asia and the world.
    We solemnly warn the Ngo Dinh Diem clique that whoever wants to occupy the territory of our 600 million Chinese people will inevitably be bruised and battered. We do not need other people's land, nor will we ever allow others to infringe upon our territory. Beijing Normal University Sun Jinwen
    The Nansha Islands are a part of our country's territory, just as Taiwan is a part of our country's territory. There are some shameless people who treat Chinese territory as their adventurous "paradise," behaving recklessly on our territory, and even wanting to seize our sacred territory. These adventurers should be warned that the Chinese people's determination to defend the sovereignty of the Nansha Islands, like their determination to liberate Taiwan, will never waver. If the adventurers do not wake up early, they will end up in a tragic failure. Tianjin Textile and Dyeing Factory Zhang Zhongwen
    The Nansha Islands and the Xisha Islands have been China's sacred territory since ancient times. During World War II, Japanese militarists tried to invade these islands. But the result was that it met a tragic failure. After Japan surrendered in 1945, these islands were all returned to China. These ironclad historical facts are known to any country. Those adventurous elements who still want to invade the Nansha Islands and other islands of our country today should remember these tragic historical lessons.

    The provocative action of the Ngo Dinh Diem clique of South Vietnam in sending naval landing forces to infringe upon our country's sacred territory of the Nansha Islands was obviously instigated by the United States. As early as the San Francisco Peace Treaty Conference convened by the United States in 1951, the United States began to plot a conspiracy to create disputes over the issue of sovereignty over our country's islands in the South China Sea. Foreign Minister Zhou already pointed out solemnly in his statement of August 15, 1951, regarding the U.S.-British draft peace treaty with Japan and the San Francisco Conference, that the entire Nansha Islands and Xisha Islands, Zhongsha Islands, and Dongsha Islands have always been Chinese territory and must not be infringed upon by anyone. But now the Ngo Dinh Diem clique is妄想(wang xiang)妄想妄想妄想妄想妄想妄想妄想妄想(wang xiang)妄想妄想妄想妄想妄想妄想妄想妄想attempting to forcibly occupy the Nansha Islands with unreasonable excuses, which is clearly another link in the overall chain of U.S. imperialism's aggression against our country.
    We know that the current world situation is gradually moving towards detente, and the United States is not reconciled to this. It still wants to use its various tools and try every means to create disputes that are unfavorable to peace. This situation cannot but arouse the serious attention of all peace-loving people.

### 我国领土主权不容侵犯

    我国领土主权不容侵犯
    最近，本报收到了许多读者来信，对南越吴庭艳集团侵犯我国南沙群岛的挑衅行为表示愤慨。下面刊载的是这些来信的一部分的摘录：
    我们中国青年热爱我们伟大的祖国和祖国的每一寸土地。我们对吴庭艳集团侵犯我国南沙群岛的挑衅行为提出坚决的抗议。
    吴庭艳集团在美帝国主义支持下，早就觊觎我国的南沙群岛，六月里他们竟厚颜无耻地声明说我国的领土的一部分——南沙群岛是他们的。很显然，这种蓄意寻衅的借口是不值一驳的。最近，南越军队竟“偷偷地”爬上了南沙群岛，插上他们的旗子和界标，妄图夺取我们的土地。
    我们决不能容忍南越当局的侵略行为。南沙群岛是我国不可分割的一部分。正如美帝国主义用军舰大炮夺不去我们的台湾一样，吴庭艳集团也休想能“偷”走我们的南沙群岛！
                  陈琮、王文贤、张淑梅、杜薪、梁连璐
    看到南越吴庭艳集团侵犯我国领土南沙群岛的消息，我的内心充满了愤怒。
    南沙群岛和西沙群岛都是我国神圣不可侵犯的领土。但是竟有这样不知羞耻的分子，在他们的美国主子的支持下，胆敢派遣海军人员侵入南沙群岛。这是对六万万中国人民的严重挑衅，这是对亚洲和世界和平的严重挑衅。
    我们严正地警告吴庭艳集团，谁要想占领我们六万万中国人民的领土，谁就必然会碰得头破血流。我们不需要别人的土地，也绝不允许别人侵犯我们的领土。　北京师范大学　孙晋文
    南沙群岛是我国领土的一部分，正像台湾是我国领土的一部分一样。有一些恬不知耻的人把中国领土当做他们冒险的“乐园”，在我国领土上胡作非为，甚至想霸占我们的神圣领土。应当警告这些冒险家，中国人民保卫南沙群岛的主权的决心，也如同解放台湾的决心一样，是永远不会动摇的。冒险家们如不及早醒悟，他们将落到一个悲惨的失败下场。　天津市织染厂　张仲文
    南沙群岛和西沙群岛，自古以来就是中国的神圣领土。在第二次世界大战时期，日本军国主义者曾想侵占这些岛屿。但结果是它悲惨地遭遇失败。1945年日本投降后，这些岛屿都全部归还了中国。这些铁一样的历史事实，是任何一个国家都知道的。那些今天还想侵占南沙群岛和我国其他岛屿的冒险分子，应当记得这些悲惨的历史教训。
                                天津市　白俊才
    南越吴庭艳集团派遣海军登陆部队侵犯我国神圣领土南沙群岛的挑衅行动，显然是美国指使的。早在1951年美国召集的旧金山对日和约会议上，美国就开始策划阴谋，企图在南海我国岛屿的主权问题上制造纠纷。周外长早在1951年8月15日关于美英对日和约草案及旧金山会议的声明中，就已严正指出，整个南沙群岛和西沙群岛、中沙群岛、东沙群岛，都一向是中国的领土，不容任何人侵犯。但是现在吴庭艳集团却妄想以无理借口强占南沙群岛，这分明是美帝国主义对我国进行侵略的总链条上的又一个环节。
    我们晓得，当前世界局势逐渐趋向缓和，美国对此是不甘心的。它还要利用它的各种工具，想尽一切办法来制造不利于和平的纠纷。这种情况，不能不提起一切爱好和平人民的严重注意。
                                武汉大学　王连生
