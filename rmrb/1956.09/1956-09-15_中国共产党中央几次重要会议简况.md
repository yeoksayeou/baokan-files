A Brief Overview of Several Important Meetings of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China

		The "August 7th" Meeting
	The "April 12th" counter-revolutionary coup launched by Chiang Kai-shek in April 1927 indicated that the right wing of the Chinese bourgeoisie had withdrawn from the revolution. On July 15th, the Wuhan Kuomintang, led by Wang Jingwei, held a so-called "anti-communist conference," announcing a formal break with the Communist Party, indicating that the entire Chinese bourgeoisie had embraced imperialism and feudal forces. At this point, the vigorous First Domestic Revolutionary War was declared a failure, and the broad masses of Communist Party members and revolutionary masses suffered extremely cruel massacres. The Chinese revolution was at a very critical juncture.
	In this situation, in order to sum up the experiences and lessons of the First Domestic Revolutionary War, correct Chen Duxiu's right-leaning opportunist erroneous line, and determine the direction of future revolutionary struggles, the Communist Party of China convened an emergency central meeting on August 7, 1927, in Jiujiang, Jiangxi. Twelve official Central Committee members, three alternate Central Committee members, five Central Committee members of the Communist Youth League, and two local representatives attended the meeting. The meeting adopted the "'August 7th' Meeting Letter to All Comrades of the Party" and the "Resolution on Recent Peasant Struggles," "Resolution on Recent Workers' Movements," and "Resolution on Party Organizational Issues," and elected a provisional Central Political Bureau of the Party.

	The main achievements of the "August 7th" Meeting were:

	1. At a critical juncture in the Chinese revolution, it resolutely corrected and ended Chen Duxiu's right-leaning opportunist line and removed Chen Duxiu from his leading position. The meeting pointed out that the fundamental error of Chen Duxiu's opportunist line lay in his failure to understand the nature of the Chinese revolution and the different roles of the various classes in the revolution, as well as the role of the Communist Party, abandoning the proletariat's leadership of the revolution, especially the leadership of armed struggle and land revolution, thus leading to the failure of the revolution.
	2. It established the general policy of land revolution and armed resistance against the Kuomintang reactionaries' policy of massacre, calling on the entire party and the people of the whole country to continue the revolutionary struggle, and decided to mobilize peasants and launch autumn harvest uprisings in Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Guangdong, provinces with relatively strong revolutionary foundations.
	The shortcomings of the "August 7th" Meeting were: it only opposed the right without preventing the "left," and did not conduct a two-line struggle, which paved the way for the "left" leaning errors that were growing at that time. The meeting did not recognize that the revolutionary situation was at a low ebb, nor did it recognize that correct counter-attacks and necessary tactical retreats should be organized according to the different conditions in various regions, in order to preserve the revolutionary base areas and revolutionary forces in a planned way. On the contrary, it allowed and encouraged adventurism and commandism (especially forced workers' strikes). This "left" leaning sentiment continued to grow after the "August 7th" Meeting, and by the enlarged meeting of the Central Committee in November 1927, it had formed a "left" leaning, blind actionist line (the first "left" leaning line).
	After the "August 7th" Meeting, Comrade Mao Zedong went to Hunan to lead the Autumn Harvest Uprising, and soon established the Xianggan Border Revolutionary Base.

			The Zunyi Conference
	From the end of 1927 to the beginning of 1933, under the correct leadership of the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese rural revolution made significant progress: more than a dozen large and small rural revolutionary base areas were established, the regular Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army developed to nearly 300,000, Chiang Kai-shek's four "encirclement and suppression" campaigns were successfully crushed by the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, and the Kuomintang's reactionary rule was severely threatened. However, since Chiang Kai-shek began his fifth "encirclement and suppression" campaign against the Red Army in October 1933, the third "left" leaning leading group in the Party negated Comrade Mao Zedong's correct military line and implemented an erroneous military line and other erroneous policies. As a result, they failed to break the enemy's "encirclement and suppression" campaign. The Party Central Committee and the Central Red Army had no choice but to withdraw from the original base area in October 1934 and begin the Long March. The "left" leaning line committed the error of flightism in the military operations of withdrawing from Jiangxi and the Long March, placing the Red Army in a passive and vulnerable position, suffering heavy losses. The erroneous leadership of the "left" leaning elements put the Red Army and the Chinese revolutionary cause led by the Party in an extremely dangerous situation.
	In order to save the Red Army and the Chinese revolutionary cause in danger, when the Long March reached Zunyi, Guizhou, in January 1935, the Communist Party of China held an enlarged meeting of the Central Political Bureau. The meeting focused on resolving two issues: First, it liquidated the military line of the third "left" leaning opportunism, and adopted the resolution on the fifth anti-"encirclement and suppression" campaign, affirming Comrade Mao Zedong's correct military line. The resolution pointed out: The main reason for the failure of this anti-"encirclement and suppression" campaign was that the "left" leaning doctrinaires committed major errors in military leadership and strategy and tactics. In the fifth anti-"encirclement and suppression" campaign and at the beginning of the Long March, they initially showed adventurism in offense, then conservatism in defense, and finally flightism in retreat. Second, it reorganized the organizational structure of the Central Secretariat and the Central Revolutionary Military Commission, removed the leading positions of the "left" leaning opportunist elements, and established the new leadership of the Party Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong.
	The great historical achievement of the Zunyi Conference lies in: it concentrated all its efforts to correct the military and organizational errors that were decisive at the time, ended the rule of the "left" leaning line in the Party Central Committee, and established Comrade Mao Zedong's leading position in the whole Party. In this way, the Party preserved and trained the backbone of the Party and the Red Army at the extremely difficult and critical juncture of the Long March, and ensured that the Party successfully completed the Long March, saving the crisis of the Party and the revolutionary cause. From then on, the Communist Party of China and the Chinese revolution have been led by the Party Central Committee, headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, this wise and great leader who can be fully trusted, and have moved from victory to victory.

			The Wayaobao Conference
	Just as Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang was fully engaged in the anti-people civil war, Japanese imperialism began its large-scale invasion of China from September 1931. Due to the Kuomintang government's adoption of the "absolute non-resistance policy," the Japanese invaders easily occupied China's three northeastern provinces (1931), Rehe and Chahar North (1933), and eastern Hebei (1935). China was facing a crisis of national subjugation. The deepening of the Sino-Japanese national contradiction changed China's political situation and class relations: workers, peasants, and students resolutely demanded resistance against Japan, and the national bourgeoisie gradually turned to resisting Japan. On August 1, 1935, the Communist Party of China issued a declaration calling for the establishment of an anti-Japanese united front, which was warmly supported by the people of the whole country. In October 1935, the Central Red Army achieved victory in the Long March and met with the Northern Shaanxi Red Army, which greatly consolidated the Northern Shaanxi revolutionary base area and powerfully promoted a new upsurge in the national anti-Japanese democratic movement. The "December 9th" Movement, which began with a large-scale anti-Japanese national salvation demonstration by students in Beijing in December 1935, marked the return of the Chinese revolution to a high tide.
	In this situation, in order to formulate the Party's new policies and tasks based on the changed domestic situation, the Communist Party of China convened a meeting of the Central Political Bureau in Wayaobao, Northern Shaanxi, in December 1935. The meeting adopted the "Central Resolution on the Current Political Situation and the Party's Tasks."
	The meeting scientifically analyzed the current situation and determined the new strategic policy of establishing an anti-Japanese national united front. The resolution passed by the meeting pointed out that because the Japanese invaders annexed the Northeast, North China, and prepared to annex the entire China, "all Chinese people who are unwilling to be slaves of subjugation and unwilling to be traitors and national traitors are forced to take a single path: to launch a sacred national revolutionary war against Japanese imperialism and its running dogs, traitors." On this basis, there arose the possibility and necessity of re-establishing a united front with the national bourgeoisie under the condition of resisting Japan. The resolution pointed out: "The highest form of the anti-Japanese, anti-traitor national united front is the organization of the National Defense Government and the Anti-Japanese Allied Forces," and decided to replace the slogan "Workers' and Peasants' Republic" with the slogan "People's Republic," and stipulated new policies of stopping the confiscation of rich peasants' property and protecting national industrial and commercial enterprises. The resolution also criticized the erroneous view within the Party that the Chinese national bourgeoisie could not unite with Chinese workers and peasants to resist Japan, pointing out that the main danger within the Party at present was "left" leaning closed-doorism; the resolution finally called on the entire Party to struggle for the resolute implementation of the Party's new strategic line and for the expansion and consolidation of the Party.
	On December 27, 1935, according to the resolution of the Wayaobao Conference, Comrade Mao Zedong made a report "On the Strategy Against Japanese Imperialism" at the Wayaobao Party activists' meeting, explaining from a theoretical and practical point of view the correctness of the strategic policy formulated by the Party Central Committee on establishing an anti-Japanese national united front, and emphasizing the decisive leadership role and core role of the Chinese Communist Party and the Red Army in this united front.
	The formulation of the policy of the anti-Japanese national united front was a major shift in the policy of the Communist Party of China, which powerfully promoted the development of a national anti-Japanese democratic upsurge. In December 1936, the patriotic "Xi'an Incident" occurred, and Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang was forced to accept the demand of "stopping the civil war and uniting with the Communist Party to resist Japan." After the Japanese invaders launched the "Lugouqiao Incident" in July 1937, Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang, under the pressure of the people of the whole country, had to announce resistance against Japan and establish an anti-Japanese national united front with the Communist Party of China. From then on, the Chinese revolution entered the sacred period of the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression for National Liberation.

			The Luochuan Conference
	After the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression, the debate between the Communist Party of China and the Kuomintang, the debate between the proletariat and the large landlords and large bourgeoisie headed by Chiang Kai-shek who participated in the war, was no longer a question of whether or not to resist Japan, but how to win victory. At this time, there were two opposing lines in the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression, namely, the "one-sided resistance" line represented by the Kuomintang and the "comprehensive resistance" line represented by the Communist Party. The Kuomintang's line of resistance was a line that led the war to failure; the Communist Party's line of resistance was a line that led the war to victory. Due to the Kuomintang government's wavering in resisting Japan and its implementation of erroneous operational policies, less than a month after the "Lugouqiao Incident," the Japanese invaders quickly occupied Beijing and Tianjin, and the Kuomintang army suffered a serious defeat on the Pingjin front. Soon, the Shanghai and Nanjing areas, the center of the Kuomintang's rule, were also subjected to large-scale attacks by the Japanese invaders. In this situation, the Kuomintang was forced to accept the suggestions of the Communist Party of China, and the negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party on cooperation in resisting Japan reached an agreement, and the anti-Japanese national united front was formally formed. On August 22, the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army was reorganized into the National Revolutionary Army's Eighth Route Army and entered the North China front in September to fight the enemy. The people of the whole country were swept into a boiling tide of resisting Japan and saving the country.
	In this situation, in order to stipulate the Party's basic policies and tasks during the War of Resistance, the Communist Party of China convened an enlarged meeting of the Central Political Bureau in Luochuan near Yan'an at the end of August 1938. The meeting adopted the "Central Decision on the Current Situation and the Party's Tasks" and the "Ten Programs of the Communist Party of China for Resisting Japan and Saving the Country."
	The meeting correctly analyzed the situation at the time, pointed out the differences between the Party and the Kuomintang regarding the "one-sided resistance" and "comprehensive resistance" lines and the harm of the Kuomintang's anti-people policies to the War of Resistance, pointed out that the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression would be a "difficult and protracted war," and determined that the Party's central task in the future was to "mobilize all forces to win the victory of the War of Resistance... to develop the already launched War of Resistance into a comprehensive national war."
	The meeting especially emphasized the Party's leading role and core role in the War of Resistance, and decided to launch independent and autonomous guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines to make guerrilla warfare bear the strategic tasks of cooperating with the front battlefield, opening up the enemy's rear battlefield, and establishing anti-Japanese base areas behind enemy lines. It also decided to launch mass anti-Japanese movements in all Kuomintang-controlled areas, and at the same time decided to strive for the political and economic rights that the people of the whole country should have, under the premise of being conducive to mobilizing the people of the whole country to participate in the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression, and decided to use rent reduction and interest reduction as the basic policy for solving the peasant problem during the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression.
	In this way, the Luochuan Conference clearly defined the Party's leadership responsibility for the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and specifically stipulated the Party's "comprehensive resistance" line, pointing out to the whole Party and the people of the whole country a correct direction and path for defeating Japanese imperialism. After the Luochuan Conference closed, the anti-Japanese guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines in North China developed rapidly under the leadership of the Communist Party, and liberated areas behind enemy lines were established one after another, and the Chinese liberated area battlefield became an important battlefield for persisting in the national War of Resistance.

			The Sixth Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee
	When the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression developed to the second half of 1938, due to Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang's implementation of the anti-people "one-sided resistance" line and the purely defensive strategic policy, it caused a serious defeat on the front battlefield: nearly a million troops were lost, and almost all of North China and most of Central China fell into the hands of the enemy. The liberated area battlefield was the opposite, because the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army implemented the "comprehensive resistance" line and the independent and autonomous active combat policy, they achieved great victories in the struggle against the enemy: they recovered most of the territory abandoned by the Kuomintang army from the enemy, liberated tens of millions of compatriots, opened up the battlefield behind enemy lines, saved the crisis of the War of Resistance, and forced the enemy to delay its offensive towards our front battlefield, so that the War of Resistance began to transition to a stalemate stage. At this time, the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army had grown from the original 40,000 to more than 180,000, and the liberated area battlefield behind enemy lines had become the main battlefield for persisting in the War of Resistance. However, at this time, the right-leaning opportunists within the Communist Party, represented by Comrade Wang Ming (Chen Shaoyu), implemented a policy of unprincipled concessions to Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang. They opposed the correct line of the Party Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, and arbitrarily implemented their own right-leaning opportunist line in their responsible work (mainly the Yangtze River Basin), thus greatly hindering the mobilization of the people and the development of anti-Japanese guerrilla warfare in the Yangtze River Basin at that time.
	In this situation, in order to sum up the experience of the War of Resistance for more than a year, criticize the errors of right-leaning capitulationism, and determine the basic policies of the Party during the War of Resistance, the Communist Party of China convened an enlarged Sixth Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee in Yan'an from the end of October to the beginning of November 1938. At the meeting, Comrade Mao Zedong made a political report on behalf of the Central Political Bureau and conclusions on "The Issue of Independence and Autonomy in the United Front" and "The Issue of War and Strategy"; finally, the plenary session passed the political resolution on "The New Stage of the Development of the Anti-Japanese National Self-Defense War and the Anti-Japanese National United Front" based on Comrade Mao Zedong's report.
	In the political report made by Comrade Mao Zedong, the situation of the War of Resistance at that time was analyzed in detail, the tasks of the Party and the people of the whole country in the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression were correctly stipulated, it was pointed out that the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression would transition to a stalemate stage, and it was especially emphasized to remind all comrades of the Party that they must clearly recognize and earnestly bear the major historical responsibility of the Party's leadership of the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression.
	The plenary session approved the Central Political Bureau's line on the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and the Anti-Japanese National United Front, pointing out that the Party must adhere to the principle of independence and autonomy in the united front, decided that the whole Party should independently and autonomously organize the people's anti-Japanese armed struggle, and put the Party's main work in the war zone and behind enemy lines, criticized the error of accommodationism on the issue of the united front, and criticized the erroneous idea of entrusting the victory of the War of Resistance to the Kuomintang army and entrusting the fate of the people to the legal movement under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries.
	Through the Sixth Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee of the Party, the cadres of the whole Party further understood the correct line of the Party Central Committee, and basically overcame the errors of right-leaning opportunism within the Party.

			The Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee
	During the Third Domestic Revolutionary War, the Chinese People's Liberation Army launched three large-scale encirclement and annihilation campaigns against the Kuomintang reactionaries from September 1948 to January 1949, namely, the Liaoshen, Huaihai, and Pingjin Campaigns, eliminating a total of about 1.5 million of the Kuomintang army's main forces and elite divisions, and achieving the basic victory of the war. On the eve of the national liberation, the Communist Party of China convened the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee in March 1949 near Shijiazhuang. Thirty-four Central Committee members and nineteen alternate Central Committee members attended the meeting.
	Comrade Mao Zedong made a work report to the plenary session. The plenary session approved the work of the Central Political Bureau since the First Plenary Session of the Party in June 1945, and believed that the leadership of the Central Committee was correct. The plenary session approved the proposal to convene a new Political Consultative Conference and establish a democratic coalition government initiated by the Communist Party of China and in cooperation with various democratic parties, people's organizations, and democratic figures, without the participation of reactionary elements. The plenary session also approved Comrade Mao Zedong's "Statement on the Current Situation" on January 14, 1949, and the eight conditions he proposed as the basis for holding peace talks with the Nanjing Kuomintang reactionary government and any other Kuomintang local government and military group.
	The Second Plenary Session, based on the analysis of the national revolutionary situation and the Party's tasks, pointed out that from now on, the period of moving from the countryside to the cities and from the cities leading the countryside has begun. The focus of the Party's work has shifted from the countryside to the cities. The Party's urban work policy should be: to rely wholeheartedly on the working class, unite with other working masses, win over intellectuals, and win over as many liberal bourgeoisie and their representatives as possible who can cooperate with us, in order to wage a resolute struggle against imperialists, the Kuomintang, and the bureaucratic bourgeoisie, and to defeat these enemies step by step; at the same time, to begin our construction cause and learn to manage cities step by step, taking the restoration and development of industrial production as the central task.
	The meeting analyzed in detail the current situation of various components of the Chinese economy, pointing out that the main economic forms in the country after the victory of the revolution are the state-owned economy of a socialist nature, the cooperative economy of a semi-socialist nature, the private capitalist economy, the individual economy, and the state capitalist economy. Among them, the socialist economy is the leading force of the entire social economy. The Party's economic policy is: to give priority to the development of the socialist state-owned economy; to gradually and actively guide the individual economy of the working people towards modernization and cooperation; to utilize, restrict, and transform the private capitalist economy and make it move towards the road of state capitalism, so that China can steadily change from an agricultural country to an industrial country, and from a new democratic country to a socialist country.
	The meeting also pointed out that after the victory of the Chinese People's Democratic Revolution throughout the country, there still exist two basic contradictions, the first being domestic, that is, the contradiction between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and the second being foreign, that is, the contradiction between the Chinese people and imperialism. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the people's democratic dictatorship led by the proletariat and based on the worker-peasant alliance, and strengthen the work of the people's democratic united front. The meeting called on all comrades of the Party to continue to maintain a clear head and a modest, prudent, and not arrogant or impetuous work style, to raise revolutionary vigilance, to prevent the sabotage of imperialism and the remnants of domestic counter-revolutionaries and the attacks of bourgeois sugar-coated bullets, and to strive to learn to build our country into a prosperous and strong new China.
	The Second Plenary Session of the Party decided on the Party's basic policies for winning the national victory and after the national victory, and stipulated the basic content of the Party's general line during the transition period.

			The Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee
	From February 6 to 10, 1954, the Communist Party of China held the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee. Thirty-five official Central Committee members and twenty-six alternate Central Committee members attended the plenary session. Fifty-two leading comrades from the Party, government, army, and people's organizations attended the plenary session as observers. Comrade Mao Zedong did not attend the plenary session because he was on vacation.
	The meeting heard the report made by Comrade Liu Shaoqi to the plenary session on behalf of the Central Political Bureau, and forty-four comrades including Zhu De and Zhou Enlai made important speeches. After detailed discussions, the plenary session unanimously passed the "Resolution on Strengthening Party Unity" proposed based on Comrade Mao Zedong's suggestion, and unanimously approved the work of the Central Political Bureau since the Third Plenary Session and the resolution to convene the National Congress of the Party in 1954.
	Based on the analysis of the political situation inside and outside the Party at that time, the meeting focused on discussing the issue of Party unity, pointing out that the socialist revolution that the Party and the people of the whole country are carrying out is a revolution that is more profound and extensive than the past revolution against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and contains extremely complex and sharp struggles. The meeting emphasized that foreign imperialists and domestic counter-revolutionaries will inevitably try every means to sabotage the revolutionary cause of our Party and people, and the most dangerous way is to find agents within the Communist Party and create disunity and division of the Party. Although our Party is basically united, consolidated, and healthy, in view of the fact that we are still adopting a policy of alliance with the bourgeoisie, and the petty bourgeoisie still surrounds us like a vast ocean; in view of the fact that our Party is very large and the Marxist-Leninist education within the Party is still very insufficient, and the ideological and political situation of some cadres is still quite complex; in view of the fact that some cadres, even some senior cadres, still do not adequately recognize the importance of Party unity, do not adequately recognize the importance of collective leadership, and do not adequately recognize the importance of consolidating and enhancing the prestige of the Central Committee; especially in view of the fact that after the victory of the New Democratic Revolution in China, a dangerously high level of arrogance has grown in some cadres within the Party. Because of some achievements in their work, they have become dizzy with success, forgetting the humble attitude and self-criticism spirit that Communist Party members must have, exaggerating personal roles, emphasizing personal prestige, thinking that they are the best in the world, and can only listen to flattery and praise, and cannot accept criticism and supervision, and suppressing and retaliating against critics, even regarding the regions and departments they lead as personal capital and independent kingdoms. Based on the above situation, the meeting sharply raised the extreme importance of strengthening Party unity to the whole Party, pointing out that "Party unity is the life of the Party and is a basic principle of Marxism-Leninism." The "Resolution on Strengthening Party Unity" passed by the meeting stipulated various specific measures to strengthen Party unity, clearly pointing out that Party unity must be and can only be unity based on Marxism-Leninism, unity based on correct political and organizational principles; the only center of Party unity is the Party Central Committee; the important guarantee of Party unity is the strict observance of the principles of democratic centralism and collective leadership; all comrades of the Party should take maintaining the Party and consolidating Party unity as the standard for guiding their words and actions.
	The Fourth Plenary Session awakened all comrades of the Party, especially Party cadres and senior cadres, to the vigilance of the enemy's conspiracies and the vigilance of individualist careerists who may appear within the Party. After the plenary session, the Party exposed and liquidated the crimes of the Gao Gang and Rao Shushi anti-Party alliance, making the whole Party more united under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong. This provided a fundamental guarantee for the victorious realization of the Party's general line during the transition period and for building our country into a great socialist country.

			The Sixth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee
	After the victory of the revolution in 1949, with the completion of the national land reform and the rapid development of the Party's socialist industrial construction, the national agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement developed rapidly under the leadership of the Party. By the summer of 1955, agricultural production cooperatives had developed to 650,000. 16.9 million households participated, accounting for 15% of the national households. On this basis, some areas had begun to see a high tide of rural cooperativization. However, at this time, some comrades within the Party were afraid that too many cooperatives would be difficult to lead, and put forward the right-leaning opportunist policy of "resolutely shrinking," and even forcibly disbanded a large number of cooperatives in some places. This caused the development of the agricultural cooperativization movement to suffer serious setbacks, causing dissatisfaction among the broad masses of peasants with the Party. In order to correct this right-leaning error and implement the Party's correct policy, on July 31, 1955, at the meeting of provincial, municipal, and district committee secretaries convened by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Comrade Mao Zedong made a report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperativization," pointing out that a new high tide of the socialist mass movement was about to arrive in the national countryside; criticizing the right-leaning errors of those who were dizzy with victory in the face of the high tide of cooperativization; summing up the experience of China's agricultural cooperativization movement, explaining the necessity and possibility of agricultural cooperativization, and pointing out the policies and measures that the Party should adopt in leading the agricultural cooperativization movement. This historically significant instruction of Comrade Mao Zedong became a great motivating force and correct guiding principle for the agricultural cooperativization movement. Under its leadership and encouragement, a national high tide of the agricultural cooperativization movement was rapidly launched.
	In this situation, the Communist Party of China held the Sixth Enlarged Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee from October 4 to 11, 1955. Thirty-eight Central Committee members and twenty-five alternate Central Committee members of the Communist Party of China attended the meeting. The Secretary of the Shanghai Bureau, the Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee, the Tianjin Municipal Committee, and the Shanghai Municipal Committee, the Secretaries of the Provincial Committees, the Party Committees of the Autonomous Regions, and the Party Committees of the prefectures, as well as the responsible comrades of the departments of the Central Committee and the Party Groups of the departments of the Central State Organs, totaling 388 people, attended the meeting as observers.
	There were two items on the agenda of this meeting: first, to discuss the issue of agricultural cooperativization; second, to discuss the issue of convening the Eighth National Congress of the Party.
	The meeting focused on discussing the issue of agricultural cooperativization. Based on the new situation of the rapid development of agricultural cooperatives at that time, the meeting pointed out that the high tide of national agricultural cooperativization had already arrived. Based on Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions on the issue of agricultural cooperativization, the meeting unanimously passed the Central Committee's "Resolution on the Issue of Agricultural Cooperativization," and further criticized the right-leaning conservative thinking that did not believe in the Party's leadership ability and did not believe in the socialist consciousness of the masses in leading the work of agricultural cooperativization, and affirmed that the Party's policy of actively developing agricultural cooperativization was the only correct policy. In order to make the development of cooperatives advance along a correct and healthy path, the meeting discussed and basically passed the draft of the "Model Articles of Association of Agricultural Production Cooperatives," and decided to submitted it to the State Council of the People's Republic of China and the Standing Committee of the National National People's Congress for discussion.
	In order to welcome and cooperate with the new high tide of the agricultural cooperativization movement, the meeting also conducted specific discussions on industry, transportation, handicrafts, finance, trade, culture and education, science, health, military, political, and legal aspects, as well as on the work of the Party, the Communist Youth League, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and the All-China Women's Federation.
	The meeting also unanimously passed the "Resolution on Convening the Eighth National Congress of the Party" and the "Regulations on the Number of Delegates and Election Methods for the Eighth National Congress of the Party."
	The convening of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party further promoted the struggle of the whole Party against right-leaning conservative thinking, thus greatly accelerating the process of China's socialist revolution.

    中国共产党中央几次重要会议简况
          “八七”会议
    1927年4月蒋介石发动的“四一二”反革命政变，表明中国资产阶级右翼已经退出革命。7月15日，以汪精卫为首的武汉国民党又举行了所谓“分共会议”，宣布正式与共产党决裂，表明中国整个资产阶级投入了帝国主义和封建势力的怀抱。至此，轰轰烈烈的第一次国内革命战争宣告失败，广大共产党员和革命群众遭到极其残酷的屠杀。中国革命处于十分危急的关头。
    在这种形势下，为了总结第一次国内革命战争的经验教训，纠正陈独秀右倾机会主义错误路线，确定以后革命斗争的方向，中国共产党于1927年8月7日在江西九江召开了中央紧急会议。出席会议者有正式中央委员十二人，候补中央委员三人，青年团中央委员五人，地方代表二人。会议通过了“‘八七’会议告全党同志书”及“最近农民斗争决议案”、“最近职工运动决议案”和
  “党的组织问题决议案”，并选举了党的临时中央政治局。
      “八七”会议的主要功绩是：
    一、在中国革命的危急关头坚决地纠正了和结束了陈独秀的右倾机会主义路线，并撤换了陈独秀的领导职务。会议指出陈独秀机会主义路线的根本错误，在于不了解中国革命的性质和各阶级在革命中的不同作用，以及共产党的作用，放弃了无产阶级对革命的领导，特别是放弃了对武装斗争和土地革命的领导，因而招致了革命的失败。
    二、确定了土地革命和武装反抗国民党反动派屠杀政策的总方针，号召全党和全国人民继续革命的战斗，决定在湖南、湖北、江西、广东这几个革命基础较强的省份，发动农民，举行秋收起义。
    “八七”会议的缺点是：只反右没有防“左”，没有进行两条战线的斗争，这就为当时正在滋长的“左”倾错误开辟了道路。会议没有认识到当时革命形势已处于低潮，没有认识到应该根据各地不同情况来组织正确的反攻和必要的策略上的退却，以便有计划地保存革命阵地和革命力量，反而允许和助长了冒险主义和命令主义（特别是强迫工人罢工）的倾向。这种“左”倾情绪在“八七”会议后继续生长，到1927年11月党中央扩大会议时，就形成为“左”倾的盲动主义路线（第一次“左”倾路线）。
    “八七”会议后，毛泽东同志就到湖南去领导秋收起义，不久就建立起湘赣边革命根据地。
              遵义会议
    从1927年末到1933年初，在党和毛泽东同志的正确领导下，中国农村革命获得了重大的进展：建立了大小十几个农村革命根据地，正规的中国工农红军发展到近三十万，蒋介石的四次“围剿”都被工农红军胜利粉碎，国民党的反动统治受到严重威胁。但自1933年10月蒋介石开始对红军第五次“围剿”时，党内第三次“左”倾领导集团否定了毛泽东同志的正确军事路线，实行了错误的军事路线和其他错误政策，结果没有打破敌人的这次“围剿”，党中央和中央红军不得不于1934年10月退出原来的根据地而举行长征。“左”倾路线在退出江西和长征的军事行动中又犯了逃跑主义的错误，使红军处于被动挨打地位，遭受惨重损失。“左”倾分子的错误领导使党领导下的红军和中国革命事业陷于极危险的境地。
    为了挽救在危险中的红军和中国革命事业，当1935年1月长征到达贵州遵义时，中国共产党举行了中央政治局扩大会议。会议集中地解决了两个问题：一、清算了第三次“左”倾机会主义的军事路线，通过了关于第五次反“围剿”的决议，肯定了毛泽东同志的正确军事路线，决议指出：这次反“围剿”失败的主要原因，是“左”倾教条主义者在军事领导上和战略战术上犯了重大错误，他们在第五次反“围剿”中和长征开始时，初则表现为进攻中的冒险主义，继则表现为防御中的保守主义，最后则表现为退却中的逃跑主义。二、改选了中央书记处和中央革命军事委员会的组织机构，撤换了“左”倾机会主义分子的领导职务，确立了以毛泽东同志为首的党中央的新的领导。
    遵义会议的伟大历史功绩就在于：它集中全力纠正了当时具有决定意义的军事上和组织上的错误，结束了“左”倾路线在党中央的统治，确立了毛泽东同志在全党的领导地位。这样党就在长征的极端艰难危急关头，保存和锻炼了党和红军的基干，并保证党胜利地结束长征，挽救了党和革命事业的危机。从此以后，中国共产党和中国革命就一直在以毛泽东同志这位英明伟大的完全可以信赖的领袖为首的党中央的领导下，从胜利走向胜利。
            瓦窑堡会议
    正当蒋介石国民党全力进行反人民内战的时候，日本帝国主义从1931年9月开始了对中国的大规模侵略。由于国民党政府采取了“绝对不抵抗主义”，日本侵略者便轻而易举地占领了我国的东三省（1931年）、热河和察北（1933年）、冀东（1935年）。中国面临着亡国危机。中日民族矛盾的加深，改变了中国的政治形势和阶级关系：工人、农民、学生坚决要求抗日，民族资产阶级也逐渐转向了抗日方面。1935年8月1日，中国共产党发表了号召建立反日统一战线的宣言，获得全国人民的热烈拥护。1935年10月，中央红军长征取得了胜利，与陕北红军相会合，这就大大地巩固了陕北革命根据地，并有力地促进了全国抗日民主运动的新高涨。1935年12月由北京学生举行抗日救国大示威而开始的“一二九”运动，标志着中国革命重新走向高潮。
    在这种形势下，为了根据已经变化了的国内新局势来规定党的新方针和新任务，中国共产党于1935年12月在陕北瓦窑堡召开了中央政治局会议。会议通过了“中央关于目前政治形势与党的任务决议”。
    会议对当前形势进行了科学分析，确定了新的建立抗日民族统一战线的策略方针。会议通过的决议指出：由于日寇吞并东北、华北并准备吞并全中国，“就把一切不愿当亡国奴、不愿充汉奸、卖国贼的中国人，迫得走上一条唯一的道路：向着日本帝国主义及其走狗、卖国贼展开神圣的民族革命战争。”在这种基础之上，便产生了同民族资产阶级在抗日的条件下重新建立统一战线的可能性和必要性。决议指出：“反日、反卖国贼的民族统一战线的最高形式，就是国防政府和抗日联军的组织”，决定用“人民共和国”的口号代替“工农共和国”的口号，并规定了停止没收富农财产和保护民族工商业的新政策。决议还批判了党内那种认为中国民族资产阶级不可能和中国工人、农民联合抗日的错误观点，指出目前党内主要危险是“左”倾关门主义；决议最后号召全党为坚决实现党的新的策略路线和为扩大与巩固党而斗争。
    1935年12月27日，根据瓦窑堡会议决议，毛泽东同志在瓦窑堡党的活动分子会议上作了“论反对日本帝国主义的策略”的报告，从理论上和实践上说明了党中央制定的关于建立抗日民族统一战线的策略方针的正确性，并着重地指出中国共产党和红军在这个统一战线中的具有决定意义的领导作用和核心作用。
    抗日民族统一战线方针的制定，是中国共产党在政策上的重大转变，它有力地推动了全国抗日民主高潮的发展。1936年12月发生了爱国的
  “西安事变”，蒋介石国民党被迫接受了“停止内战，联共抗日”的要求。在1937年7月日寇发动“芦沟桥事变”后，蒋介石国民党在全国人民的压力下，不得不宣布抗战，并同中国共产党建立了抗日民族统一战线。从此，中国革命便进入了神圣的抗日民族解放战争时期。
            洛川会议
    抗日战争爆发后，中国共产党同国民党的争论，无产阶级同参加抗战的以蒋介石为首的大地主大资产阶级的争论，已经不是应否抗战的问题，而是如何争取胜利的问题了。这时抗日战争中出现了两条相反的路线，即以国民党为代表的“片面抗战”路线和以共产党为代表的“全面抗战”路线。国民党的抗战路线，是把抗战引向失败的路线；共产党的抗战路线，是把抗战引向胜利的路线。由于国民党政府对抗战表现的动摇和实行错误的作战方针，在“芦沟桥事变”后不到一个月，日寇便迅速地占领了北京、天津，国民党军队在平津前线遭到严重失败。不久，国民党统治中心的上海、南京一带，也遭到日寇的大规模进攻。在这样的形势下，国民党被迫接受了中国共产党的建议，国共两党关于合作抗日的谈判获致了协议，抗日民族统一战线正式形成。8月22日，中国工农红军改编为国民革命军第八路军，并于9月间进入华北前线杀敌。全国人民卷入沸腾的抗日救国热潮中。
    在这种形势下，为了规定党在抗战时期的基本方针和任务，中国共产党于1938年8月末在延安附近的洛川召开了中央政治局扩大会议。会议通过了“中央关于目前形势和党的任务的决定”及“中国共产党抗日救国十大纲领”。
    会议正确地分析了当时的形势，指出了党和国民党关于“片面抗战”和“全面抗战”的路线分歧及国民党的反人民政策对抗战的危害性，指出抗日战争将是“艰苦的持久战”，确定党今后的中心任务是“动员一切力量争取抗战的胜利。……使已经发动的抗战发展成为全面的全民族的抗战”。
    会议特别强调指出党在抗战中的领导作用和核心作用，决定在敌后放手发动独立自主的游击战争使游击战争负担配合正面战场、开辟敌后战场、建立敌后抗日根据地的战略任务。并决定：在一切国民党统治区放手发动抗日的群众运动会议同时决定在有利于动员全国人民参加抗日战争的前提之下，争取全国人民所应有的政治、经济权利，并决定以减租减息作为抗日战争时期解决农民问题的基本政策。
    这样，洛川会议就明确确定了党对抗日战争的领导责任和具体规定了党的“全面抗战”路线，向全党和全国人民指出了一条战胜日本帝国主义的正确方向和道路。洛川会议闭幕后，华北敌后的抗日游击战争在共产党领导下迅速地发展起来，敌后解放区纷纷建立，中国解放区战场成为坚持全国抗战的重要战场。
          六届六中全会
    抗日战争发展到1938年下半年的时候，由于蒋介石国民党实行了反人民的“片面抗战”路线和单纯防御的战略方针，因而造成正面战场的严重溃败：损失了近百万的军队，华北的全部和华中的大部几乎都沦于敌手。解放区战场则与此相反，由于共产党和八路军、新四军实行了“全面抗战”路线和独立自主的积极作战方针，因而在对敌斗争中取得了伟大胜利：从敌人手中收复了国民党军所遗弃的大部国土，解放了数千万同胞，开辟了敌后战场，挽救了抗战的危机，并迫使敌寇迟滞了向我正面战场的进攻，使抗日战争开始向相持阶段过渡。这时，八路军、新四军已由原来的四万多人发展为十八万多人，敌后解放区战场已成为坚持抗战的主要战场。但是，这时共产党内以王明（陈绍禹）同志为代表的右倾机会主义分子，则对蒋介石国民党实行无原则的让步政策，他们反对以毛泽东同志为首的党中央的正确路线，擅自在他们所负责的工作中（主要是长江流域）执行自己的右倾机会主义路线，因而大大妨碍了当时长江流域人民群众的发动和抗日游击战争的发展。
    在这种形势下，为了总结一年多以来的抗战经验，批判右倾投降主义的错误，确定党在抗战时期的基本政策，中国共产党于1938年10月底到11月初在延安召开了扩大的第六届中央委员会第六次全体会议。在会议上，毛泽东同志代表中央政治局作了政治报告和“统一战线中的独立自主问题”、“战争和战略问题”的结论；最后，全会根据毛泽东同志的报告通过了“抗日民族自卫战争与抗日民族统一战线发展的新阶段”的政治决议案。
    在毛泽东同志所作的政治报告中，详细地分析了当时的抗战形势，正确地规定了党和全国人民在抗日战争中的任务，指出抗日战争将过渡到相持阶段，并特别强调地提醒全党同志必须明确地认识并认真地担负起党领导抗日战争的重大历史责任。
    全会批准了中央政治局关于抗日战争和抗日民族统一战线的路线，指出党在统一战线中必须坚持独立自主的原则，决定了全党独立自主地放手组织人民抗日武装斗争的方针，把党的主要工作放在战区和敌后，批判了统一战线问题上的迁就主义的错误倾向，批判了那种把抗战的胜利寄托于国民党军队、把人民的命运寄托于国民党反动派统治下的合法运动的错误思想。
    经过党的六届六中全会，使全党干部进一步地领会了党中央的正确路线，并基本上克服了党内右倾机会主义的错误。
          七届二中全会
    在第三次国内革命战争时期，中国人民解放军在1948年9月至1949年1月，连续对国民党反动派举行了辽沈、淮海、平津张三次规模巨大的围歼战役，消灭了国民党军的主力和精锐师团共约一百五十余万，取得了战争的基本胜利。在此全国解放的前夜，中国共产党于1949年3月在石家庄附近召开了七届中央委员会第二次全体会议。出席会议的中央委员三十四人，候补中央委员十九人。
    毛泽东同志向全会作了工作报告。全会批准了自1945年6月党的一中全会以来中央政治局的工作，认为中央的领导是正确的，全会批准了由中国共产党发起，并协同各民主党派、人民团体及民主人士，召开没有反动分子参加的新的政治协商会议及成立民主联合政府的建议。全会并批准了1949年1月14日毛泽东同志的“关于时局的声明”及其所提八项条件以为与南京国民党反动政府及其他任何国民党地方政府与军事集团举行和平谈判的基础。
    二中全会根据对全国革命形势和党的任务的分析，指出：从现在起，开始了由乡村到城市并由城市领导乡村的时期。党的工作重心由乡村移到了城市。党的城市工作方针应是：全心全意地依靠工人阶级，团结其它劳动群众，争取知识分子，争取尽可能多的能够和我们合作的自由资产阶级及其代表人物，以便和帝国主义者、国民党、官僚资产阶级作坚决的斗争，一步一步地去战胜这些敌人；同时即开始着手我们的建设事业，一步一步地学会管理城市，将恢复和发展工业生产作为中心任务。
    会议详尽地分析了中国经济各种成分的现状，指出了革命胜利后国内的主要经济形态是：社会主义性质的国营经济、半社会主义性质的合作社经济、私人资本主义经济、个体经济和国家资本主义经济。其中社会主义经济是整个社会经济的领导力量。党的经济政策是：优先发展社会主义的国营经济；逐步地而又积极地引导劳动人民的个体经济向现代化合作化的方向发展；利用、限制、改造私人资本主义经济，使之走向国家资本主义的道路。使中国稳步地由农业国变为工业国，由新民主主义国家变为社会主义国家。
    会议还指出：中国人民民主革命在全国胜利以后，尚存在着两种基本矛盾，第一种是国内的，即无产阶级和资产阶级的矛盾，第二种是国外的，即中国人民和帝国主义的矛盾，因而必须加强无产阶级领导的以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政，加强人民民主统一战线的工作。会议号召全党同志，继续保持清醒的头脑和谦虚谨慎不骄不躁的作风，提高革命警惕性，防止帝国主义和国内反革命残余的破坏和资产阶级糖衣炮弹的袭击，努力地学会把我国建设成为一个繁荣富强的新中国。
    党的二中全会决定了党对取得全国胜利和在全国胜利后的基本政策，规定了党在过渡时期总路线的基本内容。
          七届四中全会
    1954年2月6日至10日，中国共产党举行了第七届中央委员会第四次全体会议。出席全会的正式中央委员三十五人，候补中央委员二十六人。列席全会的有党、政、军和人民团体的主要负责同志五十二人。毛泽东同志因在休假期间没有出席全会。
    会议听取了刘少奇同志代表中央政治局向全会作的报告，朱德、周恩来等四十四个同志作了重要发言，经过详尽讨论，全会一致通过了根据毛泽东同志的建议而提出的“关于增强党的团结的决议”，并一致批准了三中全会以来中央政治局的工作和在1954年内召开党的全国代表会议的决议。
    会议根据对当时党内外政治形势的分析，着重地讨论了党的团结问题，指出：党与全国人民正在进行着的社会主义革命是一个比过去反对帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的革命具有更加深刻更加广泛意义的革命，包含着极为复杂尖锐的斗争。会议强调指出，外国帝国主义和国内反革命分子必然千方百计地破坏我们党和人民的革命事业，其中最危险的办法就是在共产党内寻找代理人、制造党的不团结和分裂。而我们的党虽然基本上是团结一致的，是巩固的、是健康的，但是鉴于我们现在还采取着和资产阶级联合的政策，而小资产阶级还像汪洋大海似地包围着我们；鉴于我们的党很大，党内的马克思列宁主义的教育还很不够，一部份干部中的思想政治情况还相当复杂；鉴于一部份干部甚至某些高级干部对于党的团结的重要性还认识不足，对于集体领导的重要性还认识不足，对于巩固和提高中央威信的重要性还认识不足；特别是鉴于在中国新民主主义革命胜利之后，党内一部分干部滋长着一种极端危险的骄傲情绪，他们因为工作中的若干成绩就冲昏了头脑，忘记了共产党员所必须具有的谦虚态度和自我批评精神，夸大个人作用，强调个人威信，自以为天下第一，只能听人奉承赞扬，不能受人批评监督，对批评者实行压制和报复，甚至把自己所领导的地区和部门看作个人的资本和独立王国。依据上述情况，会议向全党尖锐地提出了加强党的团结的极端重要意义，指出：“党的团结是党的生命，是马克思列宁主义的基本原则。”会议通过的“关于增强党的团结的决议”中，规定了各项增强党的团结的具体办法，明确指出党的团结必须是也只能是在马克思列宁主义基础上的团结，是在正确的政治原则和组织原则的基础上的团结；全党团结的唯一中心是党的中央；党的团结的重要保证是严格遵守民主集中制和集体领导的原则；全党同志应当把维护党和巩固党的团结作为指导自己言语和行动的标准。
    四中全会，唤起了全党同志首先是党的干部特别是高级干部对于敌人阴谋的警惕性，对于党内可能出现的个人主义野心家的警惕性。全会以后党即揭发和清算了高岗、饶漱石反党联盟的罪行，使全党在以毛泽东同志为首的党中央的正确领导下更加团结一致。这就为党在过渡时期总路线的胜利实现，为把我国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义国家，给了一个根本的保证。
          七届六中全会
    1949年革命胜利后，随着全国土地改革的完成和党的社会主义工业建设的迅速发展，全国农业互助合作运动在党的领导下得到了迅速的发展。到1955年夏季，农业生产合作社已发展到六十五万个。参加农户一千六百九十万户，占全国农户的15％。在此基础上某些地区已开始出现了农村合作化的高潮。但这时，党内有些同志却害怕合作社多了不好领导，提出了“坚决收缩”的右倾机会主义方针，甚至在有的地方用强迫命令的方法大批解散合作社。这样就使得农业合作化运动的发展遭到了严重的挫折，造成了广大农民群众对党的不满。为了纠正这种右倾错误，贯彻党的正确方针，1955年7月31日，在中共中央召集的省委、市委和区党委书记的会议上，毛泽东同志作了“关于农业合作化问题”的报告，指出在全国农村中新的社会主义群众运动的高潮就要到来；批判了在合作化高潮面前被胜利吓昏了头脑的右倾错误；总结了我国农业合作化运动的经验，阐明了农业合作化的必要和可能，指出了党领导农业合作化运动应当采取的方针政策。毛泽东同志这一具有重大历史意义的指示，成为农业合作化运动的伟大鼓舞力量和正确的指导方针，在它的领导和鼓舞下，迅速地掀起了全国性的农业合作化运动的高潮。
    在这一形势下，中国共产党于1955年10月4日至11日举行了第七届中央委员会第六次扩大会议。出席这次会议的有中国共产党中央委员三十八人和候补中央委员二十五人。上海局书记，北京市委，天津市委和上海市委书记，各省委、各自治区党委和各地委书记，以及党中央各部委和中央国家机关各部门党组的负责同志等三百八十八人列席了这次会议。
    这次会议的议程共有两项：第一，讨论关于农业合作化的问题；第二，讨论关于召开党的第八次全国代表大会的问题。
    会议着重地讨论了关于农业合作化的问题。根据当时农业合作社迅速发展的新情况，会议指出全国农业合作化的高潮业已到来，根据毛泽东同志关于农业合作化问题的指示，一致通过了中央“关于农业合作化问题的决议”，并进一步批判了那种在领导农业合作化工作中的不相信党的领导能力、不相信群众社会主义觉悟的右倾保守思想，肯定了党对农业合作化所采取的积极发展方针是唯一正确的方针。为了使合作社的发展循着正确和健康的道路前进，会议讨论并基本上通过了“农业生产合作社示范章程”的草案，决定提交中华人民共和国国务院和全国人民代表大会常委会讨论。
    为了迎接和配合农业合作化运动的新高潮，会议还就工业、交通运输、手工业、财政、金融、贸易、文教、科学、卫生、军事、政治、法律等方面以及就党和青年团、工会、妇女联合会等工作，进行了具体讨论。
    会议还一致通过了“关于召开党的第八次全国代表大会的决议”和“关于党的第八次全国代表大会代表名额和选举办法的规定”。
    党的七届六中全会的召开，进一步推动了全党反右倾保守思想的斗争，从而大大地加速了我国社会主义革命的进程。	中共中央高级党校	中共党史教研室  肖一平　张　弓编写
