Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 11th. The Anshan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party organized cadres from various factories and mines in Anshan to go deep into workers' families to solve their living difficulties and improve the work of family members, thereby raising the awareness and production enthusiasm of the workers.

In the past, leading cadres in many factories and mines in Anshan only focused on pursuing production achievements and did not pay attention to the demands of the producers. They rarely intervened in the living difficulties of some workers, such as not having enough to eat or wear, dilapidated and crowded housing, and family disputes. Many workers often were absent from work due to unresolved living difficulties and family problems, and their enthusiasm for production was not high.

This spring, led by the Secretary of the Anshan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, leading cadres from various factories and mines organized to conduct investigations and visits in workers' families and dormitories to help workers solve their living difficulties. From the Spring Festival to now, Anshan City has used enterprise bonus funds, trade union relief funds, and mass mutual assistance to provide relief and subsidies to more than 6,000 workers with living difficulties, and will also help some workers pay off old debts. Appropriate adjustments have also been made to workers' dormitories, and some drafty and leaky dormitories have been repaired, making many workers deeply aware that "only the Communist Party truly cares about the people's lives." Fang Zhenchun, a worker in the Anshan Iron and Steel Transportation Department who had been ill for two years, received relief. His wife said with emotion, "If it were in the old society, we would have starved to death long ago if we had been sick for more than two years."

Under the leadership of the Anshan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the leading cadres of various factories and mines criticized the erroneous idea that "family work is not within the scope of enterprise management" and bureaucratic work styles. They also actively helped the Municipal Women's Federation and other units to establish and improve the organizations of family committees, and organized family members to visit factories, promote family members to care about production, and take care of workers' lives. For example, the Medium-Sized Steel Rolling Mill organized more than 400 family members to visit the factory. After seeing their loved ones working tensely in high temperatures of over 1,000 degrees, they felt that they should take good care of their loved ones at home. Wang Dagui's wife, a worker, used to quarrel with Wang Dagui frequently. Wang Dagui often didn't sleep well, felt depressed, and his work became passive. Since the visit, whenever Wang Dagui got off work and finished eating, his wife would take the children outside to let Wang Dagui rest quietly, and she no longer quarreled with Wang Dagui. Wang Dagui was happy and worked actively, and has now been rated as an advanced producer in the factory. After the "Five Goods" (good arrangement of family life, good unity and mutual assistance among family neighbors, good education of children, good encouragement of workers in production, work and study, and good self-study) were carried out among the family members of various factories and mines, the atmosphere of family harmony and neighborhood unity is rising. Some family members have become active members in doing a good job in family work. Dong Mingzhu, a worker at the Dashiqiao Magnesium Mine, and his wife also competed with each other, and as a result, one was rated as an advanced producer and the other was rated as a model family member. People called them "double happiness."

Under the leadership of the Anshan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the living difficulties of workers in many factories and mines in Anshan have been appropriately resolved, and most workers' families have also done a good job in the "Five Goods," enabling many workers to concentrate on production and improving the enthusiasm of workers in building socialism. Many workers who were previously considered "backward" have become advanced producers, and the attendance rate of workers has also increased. For example, among the 164 workers in the Tiexi Fourth Road Street of the Anshan Iron and Steel Transportation Department, the attendance rate was very low in the past, sometimes reaching only 78%, but now it has increased to over 95%.

### 中共鞍山市委组织各厂矿干部  深入职工宿舍解决生活困难

    中共鞍山市委组织各厂矿干部
    深入职工宿舍解决生活困难
    新华社鞍山11日电　中共鞍山市委组织鞍山市各厂矿干部深入职工家庭，解决职工生活困难和做好家属工作，提高了职工的觉悟和生产的积极性。
    过去，鞍山市许多厂矿的领导干部只忙于追求生产成绩，而不去关心生产者的要求，对于有些职工有吃不饱、穿不暖和住房破漏、拥挤不堪等生活上的困难以及家庭纠纷等很少过问。许多职工因为生活困难和家庭问题长期没有解决就常常缺勤，生产的积极性不高。
    今年春季，由中共鞍山市委书记带头，组织各厂矿的领导干部深入职工家庭、宿舍进行调查访问，帮助职工解决生活困难。从春节到现在，鞍山市运用企业奖励基金、工会救济金和群众性的互助互济等办法，已经救济和补助了生活困难的职工六千多人，还将帮助一部分职工还清旧债。对职工宿舍也作了适当的调整，修补了一些透风漏雨的宿舍，使许多职工都深切地认识到“只有共产党才真正关心人民生活”。养病已经两年的鞍钢运输部工人方振春得到救济后，他爱人感动地说：“旧社会要病这两年多，我们娘儿几个早就饿死了”。
    各厂矿的领导干部在中共鞍山市委的领导下批判了某些人错误地认为“家属工作不属于本企业管理范围以内”的思想和官僚主义作风，并且积极地帮助市妇联等单位建立和健全了家属委员会的组织，还组织家属参观工厂，推动家属关心生产，体贴照顾职工生活。如中型轧钢厂组织了四百多名家属参观了工厂，她们看到亲人们冒着一千多度高温紧张地劳动的情况以后，都感到在家要好好照顾亲人。工人王大贵爱人过去经常同王大贵吵嘴，王大贵老睡不好、思想苦闷，工作就消极，自从参观后，每当王大贵下班吃完饭，他爱人就把孩子领到外面去，让王大贵安静休息，而且也不再和王大贵吵架，王大贵心里愉快，工作积极，现在已被评为厂里的先进生产者。各厂矿在家属中进行了“五好”（家庭生活安排好，家庭邻里团结互助好，教育子女好，鼓励职工生产、工作、学习好，自己学习好）工作以后，家庭和睦、邻里团结的风气在上升。有些家属已成为做好家属工作中的积极分子。大石桥镁矿工人董明珠还和他的爱人进行竞赛，结果一个被评为先进生产者，一个被评为模范家属，人们称他们是“双喜临门”。
    在中共鞍山市委的领导下，鞍山市不少厂矿的职工生活困难得到了适当的解决，大部分职工家属也做好了“五好”，使许多职工都能安心从事生产，提高了职工建设社会主义的积极性。不少过去被认为“落后”的工人已成为先进生产者，职工的出勤率也增加了，如鞍钢运输部铁西第四道街的一百六十四个职工中，过去出勤率很低，有时竟只达78％，现在已提高到95％以上。
