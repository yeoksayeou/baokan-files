Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom Does Not Preclude Grafting
Gu Yi
In the development of China's national music, how to correctly treat national tradition and foreign art is a long-standing problem in the music circle that has not been thoroughly resolved. During and outside the National Music Week, this issue has also caused a lot of controversy. Comrades Li Ling, Cheng Yun, and Zhi Xiu have respectively expressed their views on this issue, which are worth further study. This is a very complex issue, and a young music worker like me is unable to make a comprehensive analysis of it, and can only talk about my views on a few issues mentioned in Comrade Zhi Xiu's article.

In his article, Comrade Zhi Xiu sharply criticized the erroneous ideas of blindly worshipping the West and belittling or negating the traditions of national art, as well as the many crude and erroneous practices that have emerged in the reform of national art, and pointed out the dangers of this tendency, so that everyone can pay attention to it in time to avoid bringing greater harm to China's national art. This spirit of loving the national art of the motherland is completely understandable; the criticism is also correct. However, while emphasizing the importance of national heritage, Comrade Zhi Xiu also revealed incorrect views on foreign art, especially modern European music; he made many one-sided understandings on issues such as "inheritance" and "learning," "form" and "style," "popularization" and "improvement." I cannot agree with this.

	Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom Does Not Preclude Grafting
Since the Party put forward the literary and artistic policy of "Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom, weeding through the old to bring forth the new," China's artistic creation and performance have indeed shown unprecedented prosperity. Taking this first National Music Week as an example, the performance of so many classical and folk model works and excellent contemporary creations reflects the great achievements of China's music movement in recent years after implementing this policy. Among these programs, there are folk songs, operas, and folk instrumental music that are purely from the folk and have traditional national forms; there are also large choruses, symphonies, and various Western instrumental works that use modern musical forms and at the same time express the Chinese national style to varying degrees. As Comrade Li Ling previously described: "Native and fragrant; grafting, another new interest." The ability of China's musical art to bloom so many colorful and dazzling flowers is mainly due to the careful cultivation of folk art in recent years; but there is no doubt that there is also the credit of "grafting." Under the policy of "Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom," "grafting" should be said to be a desirable means of developing and reforming China's national music work, and also an experience in long-term artistic practice. However, we should also realize that this is an extremely complex and delicate work, and we must be cautious when doing it. What "flower" to move and what "wood" to connect must be selected; and a comprehensive consideration must be made based on the characteristics of various art forms; it can be "connected" if it can be connected, and it should not be forced to "connect" if it cannot be connected. For example, China's local operas have formed a very complete comprehensive art form. If other aspects are not taken into account when reforming a certain part, it will often affect the entire style and become a so-called "neither fish nor fowl." Therefore, the capacity for foreign elements will inevitably be limited to a certain extent. Music, compared to opera, is much simpler, with fewer other entanglements, which makes it more likely to accommodate foreign things. In the process of boldly trying "grafting," some comrades have shown crude attitudes in their reform work due to insufficient consideration of the characteristics of various arts and objective conditions, or due to errors in their views on folk art, which has damaged the original style of folk art; attention must be paid to and criticized for these situations. However, we cannot therefore obliterate the positive significance of "grafting" itself for the development of China's national music. Comrade Zhi Xiu only saw the shortcomings and errors in certain art reform work, and arbitrarily said that the result of "grafting" "will inevitably cause serious blows and destruction to Chinese national and folk art, and even lead to its extinction," which is an exaggeration.

Our ancestors have already done "grafting" work (Li and Cheng have already listed many examples in their articles). The genius people's musicians Nie Er and Xian Xinghai, as well as the musicians Huang Zi and Liu Tianhua who have contributed to the development of national music since the May Fourth Movement, can also be called outstanding gardeners who are good at "grafting." In their creations, they boldly transplanted foreign things to the "trunk" of China's national music, allowing it to sprout, bud, and bloom new national flowers. In many works such as Nie Er's "Graduation Song," Xinghai's "March of the Prisoners in Manchuria," Huang Zi's "The Flag is Waving," Zhao Yuanren's "Old Man in Heaven," and Liu Tianhua's erhu music "Guangming Xing" performed in this first National Music Week, traces of tunes and forms transplanted from foreign countries can be vaguely found, and at the same time, the fragrance of national music can be smelled. Obviously, this practice of "taking the strengths of Western art to make up for the shortcomings of national art" has not become "replacing Chinese with Western" in the past, and it will not be allowed to "replace Chinese with Western" in the future, but will continue to develop China's national music. Because the transplanted flowers grow and bloom in the soil and foundation of our national garden. We have full conditions to change it, and will not let it grow and grow randomly. If doing so will cut some of the flowers and trees of national art, I don’t think there is any need to be afraid. What is wrong with removing some waste branches and messy branches, connecting new varieties, and making the original flowers bloom bigger and more beautifully? Even if new branches are not connected, the flowers and trees themselves need to be pruned regularly! Necessary caution is of course good, but too much worry becomes a "housekeeper."

Comrade Zhi Xiu claims that he is not a national conservative, but he is afraid that "grafting" will "damage the wood," saying that "grafting" cannot "let a hundred flowers bloom," but can only "one flower blooms alone," and it seems that the transplanted "flower branches" must spread a large number of "plant germs." Therefore, he hurriedly blocked the gate of the national art garden and posted a seal: "No grafting is allowed." It seems that he has fulfilled the duties of a protector of national art; in fact, this closed-door approach will only prevent our national art flowers from blooming bigger and more beautifully. Comrade Zhi Xiu also believes that "the most urgent thing at present is to support China's national and folk art, carefully cultivate it, so that its foundation is solid and its branches and leaves are lush, and at the same time, it can better absorb the nutrients of foreign art"; otherwise, it will "suffer from indigestion and become morbid." The actual meaning of this paragraph is: inheriting national tradition and learning foreign art should be done in two steps; in other words, first inherit national tradition, and then learn foreign art. He mechanically separated and arranged the two important means of developing national art instructed by the Party: "One hand extends to the folk, and the other hand extends to the West." This "first Chinese, then Western" theory will bring great harm to the development of national art.

	It is necessary to clarify the national form and national style of art
The national form of art includes style and various forms of expression. However, in some cases, people often understand the national form only as the traditional form of expression. Therefore, when we conduct theoretical discussions on the issue of the national style of art, we cannot confuse the two (that is, "national form" and "form of expression"). Otherwise, the problem will be entangled. Comrade Zhi Xiu first did not distinguish between the national style of art and the traditional form of expression; he regarded the forms of expression of foreign art (such as musical genres, musical instruments, and singing methods) as only having universality and no nationality. This has led him to a series of erroneous views on how to inherit national heritage and learn foreign art.

The art of each nation has its own unique style and traditional forms of expression. However, national style does not only belong to the traditional form of expression; and the form of expression cannot replace the national style. The form of "symphony" comes from abroad. If the music being played has the style of the nation and reflects the thoughts and feelings of the people of the country, and is understood by the broad masses, we can call it a national "symphony." Xian Xinghai's "National Liberation Symphony" and Li Huanzhi's "Spring Festival Suite," He Luting's "Evening Party" and other Western orchestral works should be said to be music with Chinese national style. But they are not traditional national forms. Because the element that determines the style of music is "musical language"; and the form of expressing musical language is diverse. Composers can choose the form (including foreign musical forms) that can best express the content of the music according to the needs of the music. Nie Er created "March of the Volunteers," adopting the Western form of "march" instead of China's folk tunes; Xinghai created "Yellow River Cantata," adopting the modern form of "cantata" instead of the northern storytelling drum; isn't it to more fully express the new spiritual outlook and heroic spirit of the Chinese people?! It is a pity that there are not many such creations. How much does the Chinese people need this kind of music today! It is hard to imagine that if China's new music creation since the May Fourth Movement still stayed on the basis of the traditional national form, instead of boldly learning and using these foreign arts, it would have achieved today's achievements.

From this, it can be seen that there is no conflict between adopting foreign art forms and inheriting national traditions. Boldly and critically absorbing useful things from foreign countries and creatively applying them to our country's art can only add luster to our country's national art and will not bury it. There are many precedents in this regard in the world. When modern symphonic music was first developed and formed in Italy, German musicians Haydn, Beethoven, etc. mastered it and used it to develop their own country's music. German national music was not buried, but was known to the world for its brilliant achievements. Years later, Russian musicians Glinka, Tchaikovsky, etc. mastered it and created many immortal masterpieces. Russian national music was not buried, but made their music culture win a high position in the world. There are also precedents in China's history of absorbing foreign art. Comrade Zhi Xiu cannot oppose it. But he also said that "the Han and Tang dynasties absorbed a relatively large amount of foreign art, but this practice at that time had certain historical conditions." People can't help but ask, what historical conditions were more superior than today? Today, we have Marxism and the Party's correct literary and artistic policy as guidance; we have the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries; we have extensive cultural exchanges between countries and nations around the world; but we cannot absorb foreign art as much as the Han and Tang dynasties, which makes it difficult to understand.

	What is the real mass viewpoint?
Comrade Zhi Xiu asserted that the Chinese people can only appreciate music in the traditional national form, and that music in modern forms such as "symphony" is only liked by petty-bourgeois intellectuals, based on the reason of taking care of the masses' appreciation habits. Therefore, whoever advocates the development of China's "symphony" has "a petty-bourgeois intellectual kingdom deep in his soul," which is a "matter of stand." This statement is completely contrary to the spirit of "uniting and mobilizing all forces, encouraging various different art forms and schools to compete with each other and develop together, so as to make China's art cause prosper, so as to better serve the people and serve socialism."

Do the masses really not understand "symphony"? Do the masses not like foreign musical forms at all? I think the fundamental problem of whether they can understand and whether they like it does not lie in the musical form and musical instrument itself, but is determined by the style and content expressed by the music. The masses certainly like traditional art forms, but we cannot draw the conclusion that art in foreign forms cannot be "massified." Moreover, people's appreciation interests are multifaceted. Hobbies vary: some people like to listen to local operas, some people like to listen to songs, and some people like to listen to symphonies. As for Yue opera, Peking opera, Bangzi, Pingtan, dizi, erhu, piano, violin, etc., which art form does not have its own enthusiasts?

It should be admitted that "symphony" is more profound, and most of the people who can appreciate it are intellectuals. However, we cannot think that playing or creating "symphony" is to be divorced from the masses, let alone think that a certain art form has poor mass appeal and cannot serve the broad masses. The "mass appeal" of art works should be required at all times, but if we only measure its significance from the number of masses directly possessed by art works, we have simplified the problem too much. Take the Soviet Union as an example, the number of people who can appreciate "symphony" is not as large as ordinary folk songs. However, the broad masses of the Soviet people regard both excellent "folk songs" and "symphony" as the national art treasures; therefore, they also love and respect folk song writer Zakharov and modern symphony master Shostakovich equally; they support their creations and give their mental labor a high evaluation.

Advocating and developing China's "symphony" only shows that we don't have much in this regard, and the level is still very low, so we must work hard to catch up. We cannot always rely on introducing the works of Mozart and Beethoven to meet the people's growing demands for appreciating "symphony." No one thinks that with "symphony," we can replace everything in China's national music; with the violin, we can throw away our "erhu" (things that are really loved by the masses will never be thrown away). The actual situation can also prove that in recent years, China's "symphony" and Western instrumental music have made certain progress, but our national instrumental music has also made great progress. If the masses are dissatisfied with our music creation, the key problem is not that we have too many "symphony," but that our musicians know too little about the national musical language; they don't experience the people's lives enough; they haven't learned the techniques of modern music creation well; and they haven't created more works with new national styles (including symphony and cantata) to contribute to the people.

With the rapid development of the country's cultural and educational undertakings, the people's level of appreciating art is also getting higher and higher. Therefore, the task in front of every art worker is even more arduous. First of all, we must create a large number of more popular art works that are loved by the working people to meet the needs of the majority of people; at the same time, we must also vigorously carry out improvement work, and gradually guide the people to be able to appreciate some art with more profound content and more advanced forms. It is wrong to emphasize improvement blindly without considering the masses' ability to accept it. But if we therefore look at the masses' level of appreciation with an old eye, and always regard the people as only being able to appreciate those simple and primary art forms, it is also wrong. Comrade Zhi Xiu emphasized "what things to hand over to the 600 million compatriots today," which is certainly well-intentioned; however, we must also consider taking things out to hand over to our descendants. Otherwise, not only the current 600 million people will complain about us, but future generations will not forgive us. The Chinese singer Xian Xinghai not only created many highly combative and popular mass songs during his lifetime, but also wrote many "cantatas," "symphonies," and piano music with higher artistic forms. The path taken by Comrade Xinghai is worth our deep consideration.

	"Catching up" or "Spinning a cocoon and binding oneself"
Comrade Li Ling's article mentioned the commonality of music, mainly referring to the music language being easily understood by people of different races and different languages, and the commonality of people's aesthetic requirements. Comrade Cheng Yun's article believes that modern musical forms are jointly enriched by musicians of all nations and are shared by the international family. The above statements and the nationality of music and the author's personality are completely two different things. However, Comrade Zhi Xiu insisted on linking them to the fact that emphasizing the "commonality" of music is denying "nationality" and "personality." He also arbitrarily put on some big hats of "borrowing" and "national nihilism," which is obviously unreasonable.

I think that modern Western musical forms are not only jointly created and enriched by people of all countries, but also gradually developed and formed with social development and material civilization. Therefore, on the one hand, it is a product of the nation, and on the other hand, it is a product of the times. Just like film art, it cannot be said to be the art of any nation now. Although modern European music itself has international significance, it does not therefore turn the music of all countries into one face and one style. As Comrade Cheng Yun said: "Whoever can master it, use it to express the voice of their own nation, and be understood and welcomed by the people of their own nation, (emphasis added by the author) it belongs to whoever it is." As Comrade Zhi Xiu himself explained: "Beethoven and Chopin are recognized music masters in all countries, but they are indeed excellent musicians from Germany and Poland respectively." Isn't this obvious? The internationality of musical form does not exclude nationality. Why can musicians from other countries preserve their own national characteristics by using the same form, while today, when we advocate using this modern and progressive art form, we will inevitably lose "nationality" and "personality"? I am afraid that Comrade Zhi Xiu has not realized the contradiction in his own words! Of course, "the most national and national style art is the most international." We cannot be satisfied with "enjoying the existing art forms of the international family," and we ourselves do have excellent national art traditions, and even many great art heritages recognized by the world. However, it is undeniable that due to the obstruction of feudal rule for a long time, our music art is far behind others. Since we want to appear in the world as a nation with a high level of technology and culture and art, isn't it time to catch up?! If we think that we have our own set, we can take it out and don't need to use other people's things, it is unrealistic. It is also impossible to talk about creating a unique national form without considering the process of learning and practice. Since others have taken a step ahead, we should honestly catch up. Doing so will not hurt our national self-esteem at all. The Soviet Union, which has high achievements in music art, is our example. Therefore, everyone who truly loves the motherland and loves national art must objectively and calmly treat all current artistic phenomena and complex issues with a very cautious and meticulous attitude. Look further ahead. Don't negate all proposals to move closer to progress because of opposing dogmatism and copying the West; don't just run in the frame of "traditional form" and not be able to get out, like a silkworm spinning a cocoon and trapping yourself.

    百花齐放未尝不可以移花接木
    顾翌
    在发展我国民族音乐中，如何正确地对待民族传统和外国艺术，是一个长期存在于音乐界而没有获得彻底解决的问题。在全国音乐周的会内会外，关于这一问题也曾引起过不少的争论。李凌、程云、志修等同志分别就这个问题发表了各自的观点，值得我们深入一步研究。这是一个非常复杂的问题，像我这样一个年轻的音乐工作者，无力对它作全面的分析，只能就志修同志的文章中提到的几个问题谈一谈我的看法。
    志修同志的文章中，尖锐地批评了那些盲目崇拜西洋，轻视或否定民族艺术传统的错误思想，和在改革民族艺术中出现的许多粗暴的、错误的做法，并且指出这种倾向的危险性，让大家及时引起注意，免得给我国的民族艺术带来更大的危害。这种出于热爱祖国的民族艺术的精神是完全可以理解的；批评也是正确的。可是，志修同志在强调重视民族遗产的同时，却又流露了对待外国艺术，特别是近代的欧洲音乐的不正确的看法；在“继承”和“学习”、“形式”和“风格”、“普及”和“提高”等问题上作了许多片面的理解。这是我所不能同意的。
              百花齐放未尝不可以移花接木
    自从党提出了“百花齐放，推陈出新”的文艺政策以后，我国的艺术创作和演出，确实呈现了前所未有的繁荣景象。拿这次第一届全国音乐周来说，演出了这许多古典、民间的典范作品和当今的优秀创作，也正是反映了近年来我国音乐运动中贯彻了这一政策以后的巨大收获。这些节目中，有纯粹来自民间，具有传统的民族形式的民歌、戏曲和民间器乐；也有运用了近代的音乐形式，同时又在不同程度上表现了我国民族风格的大合唱、交响乐，和各类西洋器乐作品。正如李凌同志先前所形容：“土生土长，馥沃芬芳；移花接木，另有新趣”。我国的音乐艺术能够开出这许多五光十色、鲜艳夺目的花朵，固然主要是由于几年来对民间艺术细心栽培的结果；但也无容置疑，这里面还有“移花接木”的劳绩。在“百花齐放”的政策下“移花接木”，应该说，是发展和改革我国民族音乐工作中的一种可取的手段，也是长期艺术实践中的一项经验。但是，我们也应该认识到，这是一件异常复杂和细致的工作，做起来必须谨慎。移什么“花”，接什么“木”，必须有所选择；还须根据各种艺术形式的特点作全面的考虑；可接则“接”，不可接不应强“接”。比如，我国的地方戏曲，它已经形成了一种很完整的综合艺术形式，当改革某一部分时如果不考虑到其他方面，往往要影响到整个的风格，弄成所谓“四不像”。因此，对外来因素的容纳量势必会受到一定的限制。音乐，比起戏曲来，就单纯得多，其它的牵扯较少，这就使它有较大的可能容纳外来的东西。有些同志在大胆尝试“移花接木”的过程中，由于对各种艺术的特点和客观的条件考虑不周，或者由于对民间艺术看法上的错误，在改革工作中表现了粗暴的态度，损害了民间艺术的原有风格；对于这些情况是必须引起重视和加以批判的。但是，我们却不能因此一笔抹煞“移花接木”的做法本身对发展我国民族音乐的积极意义。志修同志仅仅看到某些艺术改革工作中的缺点和错误，便武断地说，“移花接木”的结果“必然会使中国的民族的和民间的艺术受到严重的打击和摧残，乃至归于消灭”，未免言过其实了。
    我们的祖先早就做过了“移花接木”的工作（李、程两文中已经列举了不少例子）。天才的人民音乐家聂耳和冼星海，以及五四以来在发展民族音乐的工作上有过贡献的音乐家黄自、刘天华等人，也可以堪称是擅长于“移花接木”的出色的园丁。他们在创作中，就曾经大胆地移植了外国的东西到我国民族音乐的“树干”上来，让它发芽、吐蕊，开出新的民族的花朵。像这次第一届全国音乐周中所演出的聂耳的“毕业歌”、星海的“满洲囚徒进行曲”、黄自的“旗正飘飘”、赵元任的“老天爷”以及刘天华的二胡曲“光明行”等许多作品中，都可以隐约发现从外国移植过来的音调和形式的痕迹，同时又能嗅到民族音乐的芬芳。显然，这种“取西洋艺术之长，补民族艺术之短”的做法，在过去并没有成为“以西代中”，今后同样不可能让它“以西代中”，而是要继续发展我国的民族音乐。因为移来的花是在我们民族花园的土壤里、根基上生长、开花。我们有充分的条件可以改变它，不会由着它乱生乱长。如果说，这样做将要斫伤一点民族艺术的花木，我想也用不着骇怕。去掉一些废枝、乱枝，接上新的品种，让原先的花开得更大、更美，有何不可呢？即使不接上新枝，花木本身也需要经常的修剪呀！必要的小心当然是好，过多的顾虑就成了“管家婆”了。
    志修同志一面声称自己不是民族保守主义者，但又唯恐“接枝”就要“损木”，说什么“移花接木”便不能“百花齐放”，只能“一花独艳”，似乎移来的“花枝”必定要大量散布“植物病菌”。因此，赶忙把民族艺术花园的大门堵死，贴上封条：“不准移花接木”。看来，他是尽了民族艺术保护人的职责；实际上，这种闭关自守的做法，只不过要让我们民族艺术的花朵从此开不大、开不美罢了。志修同志还认为，“当前最急要的事情，是要把中国的民族的、民间的艺术扶植起来，细心地加以栽培，使它根基巩固，枝叶茂盛，同时也就能够更好地吸收外国艺术的养料”；否则便要“消化不良，成为病态”。这一段话的实际含意就是：继承民族传统和学习外国艺术应该分作两步走；换句话说就是先继承民族传统，后学习外国艺术。他把党所指示的发展民族艺术中的两项重要手段：“一手伸向民间，一手伸向西洋”机械地割裂开来，加以排队。这种“先中后西”的理论，将给民族艺术的发展带来多么大的危害。
          要弄清楚艺术的民族形式和民族风格
    艺术的民族形式包括了风格和各种表现形式。但是，在某种情况下，人们又常常把民族形式仅仅理解为传统的表现形式。因此，当我们对艺术的民族风格问题进行理论探讨的时候，就不能把这两者（即“民族形式”和“表现形式”）混淆在一起。否则，问题就会纠缠不清。志修同志首先没有把艺术的民族风格和传统的表现形式区别开来；他把外国艺术的表现形式（如音乐的体裁、乐器和唱法等），看成为只有世界性而不可能有民族性。这就使他在如何继承民族遗产和学习外国艺术的问题上，产生了一系列错误的看法。
    各个民族的艺术都有它独自的风格和传统的表现形式。但是，民族风格却不仅仅属于传统的表现形式；而表现形式又不能代替民族风格。“交响乐”这一形式来自外国，如果演奏的是一首具有本民族的风格、反映了本国人民的思想感情并为广大人民所理解的乐曲，我们就可以称它为民族的“交响乐”。冼星海的“民族解放交响乐”和李焕之的“春节组曲”、贺绿汀的“晚会”等西洋管弦乐作品，应该说都是具有中国民族风格的音乐。但是它们都不是民族的传统形式。因为，决定音乐风格的要素是“音乐语言”；而表达音乐语言的形式却是多种多样的。作曲家可以根据音乐的需要，选择最能表达音乐内容的形式（包括外国的音乐形式）。聂耳创作“义勇军进行曲”，采用了西洋“进行曲”的形式而不采用我国的民间小调；星海创作“黄河大合唱”采用了近代的“大合唱”形式而不采用北方的说唱大鼓；不就是为了更充分地表达我国人民新的精神面貌和英雄气概吗？！可惜的是，这样的创作还不多，今天的中国人民是多么需要这类音乐啊！很难想像，五四以来我国的新音乐创作，如果仍然停留在传统的民族形式的基础上，而不是大胆地学习和运用了这些外来的艺术，会获得今天这样的成就的。
    由此可见，采用外国艺术的形式和继承民族传统并没有抵触。大胆地、批判地吸收外国有用的东西，创造性地运用到我国的艺术中来，只能给我国的民族艺术增添光彩而不会把它湮没。在这一方面，世界的先例很多。当近代交响乐最先在意大利发展和形成起来以后，德国的音乐家海顿、贝多芬等人掌握了它并且用来发展自己国家的音乐，德国的民族音乐并没有被湮没，相反的却以辉煌的成就见称于世界。若干年后，俄罗斯的音乐家格林卡、柴可夫斯基等人掌握了它，创作了许多不朽的杰作，俄罗斯的民族音乐也没有被湮没，反而使他们的音乐文化在世界上赢得了崇高的地位。在我国历史上也有吸收外来艺术的先例，志修同志无法反对。可是却又说什么“汉、唐比较大量地吸收了外来的艺术，但当时这样作法是具有一定的历史条件的”。人们不禁要问，当时的历史条件究竟有那些比今天更优越？我们今天，有马克思主义和党的正确文艺方针作指导；有苏联等兄弟国家的先进经验；有世界各国、各民族之间广泛的文化交流；倒反而不能像汉、唐时代那样大量地吸收外国艺术，这就使人难以理解了。
                真正的群众观点是什么
    志修同志以照顾群众的欣赏习惯为理由，便断定说，我国人民只能欣赏传统的民族形式的音乐，像“交响乐”等近代形式的音乐只有小资产阶级知识分子才喜欢。因而，谁提倡发展我国的“交响乐”，他的“灵魂深处还是一个小资产阶级知识分子的王国”，是“立场问题”了。这种说法，和“团结、调动一切力量，鼓励各种不同的艺术形式和流派互相竞赛，共同发展，使我国的艺术事业繁荣起来，以便更好地为人民服务，为社会主义服务”的精神是完全背道而驰的。
    群众真的听不懂“交响乐”吗？外来的音乐形式群众完全不喜爱吗？我想，能否听懂，是否喜爱的根本问题不在于音乐形式和乐器本身，而是决定于乐曲表现的风格和内容。群众固然喜爱传统的艺术形式，但也不能就此得出结论，说外来形式的艺术便不可能“群众化”。何况人民的欣赏兴趣又是多方面的。爱好各有不同：有人爱听地方戏，有人爱听歌曲，也有人爱听交响乐。至于越剧、京戏、梆子、评弹、笛子、二胡、钢琴、小提琴等，那一样艺术形式没有它各自的爱好者呢？
    应该承认，“交响乐”是比较艰深一些，能够欣赏它的人还以知识分子居多。可是，我们却不能就此认为演奏或创作“交响乐”便是脱离群众，更不能认为某种艺术形式群众性较差，便不可能为广大人民服务。要求艺术作品的“群众性”在任何时候都是应该的，但若仅仅从艺术作品直接所拥有的群众多寡来衡量它的意义，未免把问题看得太简单了。拿苏联来说，能够欣赏“交响乐”的人也不像普通的民歌那样多。但是，广大的苏联人民却把优秀的“民歌”和“交响乐”都看成是全民的艺术财宝；因而对于民歌作家查哈罗夫和近代交响乐大师萧斯塔科维奇也是同样的热爱和尊敬；支持他们的创作，给予他们的思想劳动以很高的评价。
    提倡和发展我国的“交响乐”，只不过是说明了在这一方面我们的东西还不多，水平还很低，必须努力赶上去。我们不能老是指靠介绍莫扎特、贝多芬的作品，来满足人民日益增长的欣赏“交响乐”的要求。谁也没有这样认为有了“交响乐”，就可以代替我国民族音乐的一切；有了小提琴，就可以把我们的“二胡”扔掉（真正为群众所喜爱的东西是永远扔不了的）。实际情况也可以证明，近年来我国的“交响乐”以及西洋器乐曲有了一定的发展，但是，我们的民族器乐也有了很大的进步。如果说，群众对我们的音乐创作不满，关键问题不在于我们的“交响乐”太多了，而是由于我们的音乐家们对民族音乐语言了解得太少；对人民生活体验得不够；近代音乐创作的技巧学习得还不到家；没有创作出更多的具有新的民族风格的作品（包括交响乐、大合唱）贡献给人民。
    随着国家文化教育事业的迅速发展，人民欣赏艺术的水平也越来越高。所以，摆在我们每一个艺术工作者面前的任务就益发艰巨了。首先，我们要大量创作一些为劳动人民所喜闻乐见的、比较通俗的艺术作品来满足大多数人的需要；同时，还必须大力进行提高的工作，逐步引导人民能够欣赏一些内容更深刻、形式比较高级一些的艺术。一味的强调提高，毫不考虑到群众的接受能力是不对的。但若因此就用一付老眼光看待群众的欣赏水平，永远把人民视为只能欣赏那些浅显的、初级的艺术形式，同样也是错误的。志修同志强调“今天对于六万万同胞又拿什么东西向他们交账”，当然是一番好心；不过，也要考虑到拿出东西来向我们的子孙后代交账才行。否则，不仅现在的六万万人民要埋怨我们，将来子孙后代也不会原谅我们的。中国人民的歌手冼星海，他生前不仅创作了许多战斗性很强的、通俗的群众歌曲，同时也写下了不少艺术形式较高的“大合唱”、“交响乐”和钢琴曲。星海同志所走的道路，是值得我们深思的。
             “迎头赶上”还是“作茧自缚”
    李凌同志的文章中曾经提到音乐的共通性，主要是指音乐语言的易于为不同种族、不同言语的人民所理解和人民审美要求的共通性而说的。程云同志的文章中认为近代的音乐形式是由各民族的音乐家所共同丰富起来的，已为国际大家庭所共有。以上的说法和音乐的民族性以及作者的个性完全是两回事。而志修同志却要硬扯上什么强调了音乐的“共通性”便是否定了“民族性”和“个性”。又凭空扣上些“拿来主义”、“民族虚无主义”的大帽子，显然是没有理由的。
    我认为近代的西洋音乐形式，不仅是由各国人民所共同创造和丰富起来的，而且也是随着社会发展和物质文明，逐渐发展形成起来的。因而它一方面是民族的产物，同时也是时代的产物。就像电影艺术现在已经不能说是那一个民族的艺术一样。尽管近代欧洲音乐本身具有国际的意义，但并不因此而把各国的音乐都变成一个面貌，一种风格。正如程云同志所说：“谁能掌握它，运用它去倾吐自己民族的心声，并为本民族的人民所理解、所欢迎，（重点为笔者所加）它就是谁的。”也正如志修同志自己所作的解释：“贝多芬、肖邦是世界各国公认的音乐大师，但他们两人又的确分别地是德国的和波兰的优秀音乐家”。这不很明显吗？音乐形式的国际性并不排斥民族性。为什么别国的音乐家运用了同一的形式能够保存其本民族的特色，而我们今天一提倡运用这一近代的进步艺术形式，便必然会失去“民族性”和“个性”呢？恐怕志修同志还没有意识到自己说话的前后矛盾吧！当然，“最富有民族色彩和民族风格的艺术，才是最有国际意义的”。我们不能以“坐享国际大家庭现有的艺术形式为满足”，而且我们自己也确实有着优秀的民族艺术传统，甚至有着许多举世所公认的伟大的艺术遗产。然而，也无庸讳言，由于长时期来封建统治的阻塞，我们的音乐艺术是远远地落后于人家了。我们既然要以具有高度技术和文化艺术水平的民族出现于世界，难道今天还不是迎头赶上去的时候吗？！如果认为我们自己有一套，可以拿出去，不必运用人家的东西，这是不现实的。空谈创造独特的民族形式，忽视学习和实践的过程也是行不通的。既然人家已经走前了一步，我们就应该老老实实地赶上去。这样做丝毫也不会损伤我们的民族自尊心。在音乐艺术上，有着高度成就的苏联就是我们的榜样。因此，每个真正热爱祖国、热爱民族艺术的人，都必须客观冷静地以十分谨慎而细致的态度，对待当前艺术上的一切现象和复杂的问题。把目光放远一些。不要因为反对教条主义和照搬西洋，而把所有向进步看齐的倡议一概否定；不要只钻在“传统形式”的框子里跑不出去，像蚕一样作成了茧子反而困住了自己。
