An Overview of Indonesia

The Land of a Thousand Islands

Opening a map, one sees over three thousand islands scattered between the continents of Asia and Australia, at the junction of the Indian and Pacific Oceans. This is the "Land of a Thousand Islands" – Indonesia. It is one of the major countries in Asia, with a total area of approximately two million square kilometers and a population of over eighty million.

If you approach the Indonesian coast by ship, you can see tropical coconut trees and palm trees swaying gracefully in the wind. On the fertile land, there are patches of green rice paddies and banana, papaya, and pineapple orchards laden with fruit.... The interior of these islands is mostly mountainous. Farmers have built terraced fields on the slopes, growing tea and tobacco.

Indonesia is a country with evergreen seasons, with little change in temperature throughout the year, only a distinction between rainy and dry seasons. The warm climate and abundant rainfall provide favorable conditions for agricultural production in Indonesia.

Indonesia is rich in natural resources. Many agricultural products occupy an important position in the world. According to 1940 statistics, quinine accounted for 91% of the world's total output, pepper 92%, and kapok 77%. Since 1950, rubber production has surpassed Malaya to become the world's largest. In terms of minerals, there are oil, tin, bauxite, coal, iron, etc. Indonesia's oil fields are very large, and the 1952 output has exceeded pre-war levels, but the vast majority of oil is still controlled by Dutch, British, and American capitalists.

A Long History and Culture

Indonesia is one of the ancient countries in Asia. Historians generally believe that 1500 BC is the beginning of its historical era. In the early fifth century, the first country, "Taruma," was established in West Java. The Chinese Jin Dynasty monk Faxian mentioned the situation of "Yavadvipa" (now Java) in his "A Record of Buddhist Kingdoms." Buddhism was introduced to Indonesia in the sixth and seventh centuries, and Islam in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. There are many mausoleums and statues of gods and Buddhas in Indonesia, with the "Borobudur" stupa on the high mountains of Central Java being the most magnificent. This stupa is now over a thousand years old, with a huge body, reaching nine stories high. There are many niches and Buddha statues inside the stupa, and on the stone walls on both sides of the stupa's corridor, there are reliefs with mythological themes that stretch for several kilometers.

In addition to sculpture, Indonesia's music and dance are also very beautiful. Indonesian song and dance are full of tropical flavor, mostly involving hand and waist movements, with flexible and soft wrist and finger tremors during the dance. Indonesian people, regardless of age or gender, are very fond of singing and dancing. During festivals or weddings and funerals, they often set up stages to perform songs, dances, and dramas. The dances of each island have their own different moods and styles, with the dances of Bali being the most beautiful. The dancers there receive strict training from an early age, and their hand, foot, and head movements have unique techniques, which are world-renowned.

Shaking Off the Shackles of Colonialism

As early as the beginning of the sixteenth century, Spanish, Portuguese, British, and Dutch colonialists successively invaded the islands of Southeast Asia under the pretext of buying spices. In 1596, the Netherlands invaded Indonesia and ruled it for three hundred and fifty years. During these long and dark years, the Dutch colonialists carried out cruel oppression and greedy plunder of this country with a population of eighty million. In 1830, the Dutch implemented a forced cultivation system in Java, forcing the people to use the best land to grow crops designated by the colonial government, turning Indonesia into its cheap raw material supply base. Under Dutch colonial rule, Indonesian farmers were often unable to get enough food and clothing, and a worker's monthly salary could often only sustain about ten days of living. The people's health conditions were terrible, and diseases such as lung disease, plague, and smallpox were very prevalent. A country famous for producing quinine had as many as thirty million people – about 40% of the total population – suffering from malaria. National education and ethnic culture were suppressed, and illiteracy accounted for 93% of the population.

In order to resist the cruel oppression of the colonialists, the Indonesian people carried out long-term struggles one after another. Among the more famous ones were the Padri War in western Sumatra in 1821, the Aceh War from 1873 to 1904 lasting for thirty years, and the Java people's uprising in 1925. In those years, the people revolted almost every ten years on average. Although each uprising was suppressed, the people's will to fight was not frustrated in the slightest. This shows the great tenacity and heroism of the Indonesian people in opposing colonialism.

During the three years of occupation by Japanese imperialists, the Indonesian people carried out a nationwide mass national liberation movement and organized a heroic armed struggle. Finally, on August 17, 1945, Indonesia declared its independence. The slogan "Merdeka" (Independence) resounded through every corner of the three thousand islands, and the people's long-cherished desire was realized.

Moving Forward on the Road to Independence

In the eleven years since, the road for the Indonesian people to strive for complete national independence has not been smooth, but after all, they have been constantly advancing along the road to independence. Supported by other colonialists, the Dutch colonialists launched colonial wars twice in 1947 and 1948, attempting to strangle the young Republic of Indonesia and rebuild their colonial rule. But they failed.

In order to achieve complete independence, the Indonesian government held negotiations with the Dutch government on abolishing the "Round Table Conference Agreement" signed in 1949 and recovering West Irian, but due to the Dutch government's refusal to change its colonialist position and the interference of the United States, the negotiations repeatedly failed. In order to safeguard national independence and sovereignty, the Indonesian government then announced in May 1956 the act of abolishing all Round Table Conference agreements. They continue to fight for the recovery of West Irian.

In recent years, the Indonesian people have achieved great successes in political, economic, and cultural fields. In March of this year, Indonesia completed its first general election, strengthening national unity and ethnic solidarity. In terms of diplomacy, the Indonesian government firmly implements an independent foreign policy, opposes colonialism and opposes war, and actively strives for world peace and international cooperation. Indonesia has made significant contributions to the Asian-African Conference. It refuses to participate in military blocs organized by the United States and advocates peaceful coexistence among countries. It continues to expand contact with countries around the world, establish friendly relations with countries, develop cultural and economic exchanges, and plays an increasingly active role in international affairs. Recently, the Indonesian government representatives' support for Egypt's just position on the Suez Canal issue has been unanimously praised by peace-loving people around the world.

    印度尼西亚概貌
    千岛之国
    翻开地图来看，在印度洋和太平洋交界处，有三千多个岛屿散布在亚、澳两大陆之间，这便是“千岛之国”——印度尼西亚。它是亚洲大国之一，总面积约两百万平方公里，人口八千多万。
    如果你乘轮船驶近印度尼西亚海岸，便可以望见热带的椰子树、棕榈树，婀娜多姿地随风摇曳。在肥沃的土地上，散布着一片片绿油油的稻田，和结满果实的香蕉园、木瓜园、菠萝园……。在这些岛屿的内地，多半是山区。农民们在山坡上修筑了层层叠叠的梯田、种植着茶树和烟叶。
    印度尼西亚是四季常青的国家，全年寒暑变化不大，只有雨季和旱季之别。温暖的气候和丰沛的雨水，给予印度尼西亚农业生产造成有利的条件。
    印度尼西亚的天然资源非常丰富。有不少农产品在世界上占重要地位。据1940年统计，金鸡纳霜占世界总产量的91％，胡椒占92％，木棉占77％。自1950年后，橡胶生产已超过马来亚，跃居世界第一位。在矿产方面，有石油、锡、铁矾土、煤、铁等。印度尼西亚的油田规模很大，1952年的产量已超过战前水平，但石油绝大部分仍操纵在荷、英、美资本家手中。
    悠久的历史和文化
    印度尼西亚是亚洲古老国家之一，史学家通常认为公元前1500年是它历史的开始年代。五世纪初在西爪哇建立第一个国家“多罗磨”。我国晋朝法显“佛国记”中曾提到“耶婆提”（即今爪哇）的情况。远在六、七世纪，佛教传入印度尼西亚，十三、四世纪又传入伊斯兰教。印度尼西亚的陵庙和神像雕刻很多，中爪哇高山上的佛塔“婆罗浮屠”最为雄伟。此塔至今已有一千多年的历史，塔身巨大，高达九层，塔内有许多佛龛和佛像，塔阶走廊两边的石壁上，有长达数公里以神话为题材的浮雕。
    除了雕刻艺术外，印度尼西亚的音乐和舞蹈也很优美。印度尼西亚歌舞富有热带情调，大部分是手和腰的动作，舞时手腕和手指的颤动灵活柔软。印度尼西亚人民不论男女老少都非常爱好歌舞。每逢佳节或婚、丧，他们常常搭起舞台表演歌舞和戏剧。各个岛屿的舞蹈有它不同的情调和风格，其中以峇厘岛的舞姿最优美。那里的舞女从小就受严格的训练，手、足和头部的表演有它独特的技巧，闻名于世。
    摆脱殖民主义的枷锁
    远在十六世纪初，西班牙、葡萄牙、英国、荷兰殖民者以购买香料为名，相继侵占东南亚各岛。1596年荷兰侵占印度尼西亚，一直统治了三百五十年。在这漫长的黑暗的岁月里，荷兰殖民者对这个拥有八千万人口的国家实行了残酷的压迫和贪婪的掠夺。1830年荷兰在爪哇实行了强迫种植制度，强迫人民把最好的土地用来种殖民政府指定的农作物，把印度尼西亚变为它的廉价原料供应地。在荷兰殖民统治下，印度尼西亚农民常年不得温饱，工人一个月的工资往往仅能维持十天左右的生活。人民健康情况恶劣不堪，肺病、鼠疫、天花等疾病很为流行。一个出产金鸡纳霜著名的国家，竟有三千万人——约占总人口的40％的人民患虐疾。国民教育和民族文化受到压制，文盲占人口的93％。
    为了反抗殖民者残酷的压迫，印度尼西亚人民前仆后继地进行了长期的斗争。其中较著名的有1821年苏门答腊西部的伯特里战争、1873—1904年长达三十年的亚齐战争和1925年的爪哇人民的起义等。在那些年代里，人民几乎平均每十年就起义一次。虽然每次的起义都被镇压下去了，但是人民的斗争意志丝毫没有挫折。这显示了印度尼西亚人民反对殖民主义的极大的顽强性和英勇精神。
    在日本帝国主义者占领的三年多期间，印度尼西亚人民又进行了全国规模的群众性的民族解放运动，组织了英勇的武装斗争。终于，在1945年8月17日，印度尼西亚宣布了独立。“默迪加”（独立）的口号，响遍了三千多个岛屿的每个角落，人民多年的愿望实现了。
    在独立的道路上前进
    十一年以来，印度尼西亚人民争取民族完全独立的斗争的道路并不平坦，但毕竟是沿着独立的道路不断前进。荷兰殖民主义者在其他殖民主义者的支持下，曾于1947年和1948年连续两次发动殖民战争，企图扼杀年青的印度尼西亚共和国，以重建他们的殖民统治。但是他们失败了。
    为了取得彻底的独立，印度尼西亚政府曾和荷兰政府进行关于废除1949年签订的“圆桌会议协定”和收回西伊里安问题的谈判，但是由于荷兰政府不肯改变它的殖民主义立场，以及美国的干涉，谈判屡遭失败。印度尼西亚政府为了维护国家独立和主权，遂于1956年5月宣布废除全部圆桌会议协定的法案。他们并继续为收回西伊里安而奋斗。
    近些年来，印度尼西亚人民在政治、经济和文化方面都获得很大成就。今年3月，印度尼西亚完成了第一次普选，加强了国家的统一和民族团结。在外交方面，印度尼西亚政府坚定地执行独立自主外交政策，反对殖民主义和反对战争，积极为世界和平和国际合作而努力。印度尼西亚对亚非会议作出了显著的贡献。它拒绝参加美国组织的军事集团，主张各国和平共处。它不断扩大与世界各国的接触，与各国建立友好关系，发展文化和经济来往，在国际事务中起着愈来愈积极的作用。最近，印度尼西亚政府代表在苏伊士运河问题上支持埃及的正义立场，更获得了世界爱好和平的人民的一致赞扬。
