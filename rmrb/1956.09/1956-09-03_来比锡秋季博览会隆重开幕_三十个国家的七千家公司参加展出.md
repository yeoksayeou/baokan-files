Xinhua News Agency, September 2nd: According to a report by the German News Agency, the Leipzig Autumn Fair, with the participation of 7,000 companies from thirty countries, grandly opened in Leipzig on the evening of September 1st. Many foreign guests attended the opening ceremony.

    Heinrich Rau, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign and Domestic Trade of the German Democratic Republic, emphasized in his opening speech the importance of the Leipzig Fair as a trade intermediary between the West and the East. He expressed his belief that this Autumn Fair would point out new avenues and prospects for expanding trade volume and would serve as a bridge for trade partners in the world's two markets to make new contacts, thus living up to the great tradition of Leipzig.

    Heinrich Rau emphasized the increasing importance of independent, anti-imperialist national states in international trade. He said that these countries, on the one hand, provide an increasingly large market for industrial products, and on the other hand, their increasing productivity provides new possibilities for their exports.

    In his opening speech, Heinrich Rau also spoke about the German Democratic Republic's desire and prospects for developing international trade. He cited figures to illustrate the enormous development of the German Democratic Republic's foreign trade, especially with independent and autonomous countries in Asia and Africa, in the past year and a half.
