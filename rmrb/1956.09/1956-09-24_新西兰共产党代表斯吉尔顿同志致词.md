Comrade Skjoldton, Representative of the Communist Party of New Zealand, Delivers Speech
Dear Comrades:

    On behalf of the white and Maori Communists of New Zealand, we extend our warmest congratulations to the Eighth National Congress of your great Party and to your Party Chairman Mao Zedong. We are deeply grateful for the honor of being able to attend your Congress, witness your socialist construction firsthand, and directly understand your experience in creatively developing Marxism-Leninism in the specific conditions of your great country.

    Comrades, please allow me to read to you the congratulatory message from the National Committee of the Communist Party of New Zealand:
    To the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China,
    Dear Comrades:

    We are very pleased to extend fraternal congratulations from the National Committee of the Communist Party of New Zealand to the Eighth National Congress of your Party.

    We have been following with admiration the very great achievements you have made in all aspects of the people's lives.

    It should be particularly pointed out that the enormous impact of your actions has been a major factor in maintaining peace in the Pacific region and throughout the world.

    Our New Zealand has joined the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, which was planned by US imperialism, and this organization is diametrically opposed to the Five Principles that guide your relations with other countries.

    Therefore, we face a serious task, and we will resolutely strengthen our work to mobilize the people of New Zealand to withdraw our country from the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.

    We will work with confidence to establish diplomatic relations between our country and the People's Republic of China, and to conclude a convention based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

    We wish your Congress complete success in its discussions for peace and for the happiness and security of the Chinese people.

              National Committee of the Communist Party of New Zealand
                General Secretary: Wilcox (signed)
    Thank you, comrades. (Attached picture)

    新西兰共产党代表斯吉尔顿同志致词亲爱的同志们：
    我们代表新西兰白人和毛里族人的共产党员，向你们伟大的党的第八次代表大会和你们党的主席毛泽东致最热烈的祝贺。我们深深感谢能有这样的荣幸来出席你们的代表大会，亲眼看到你们的社会主义建设，直接了解你们在你们伟大的国家的具体条件下创造性地发展马克思列宁主义的经验。
    同志们，现在请允许我向你们宣读新西兰共产党全国委员会的贺词：中国共产党中央委员会亲爱的同志们：
    我们非常高兴地代表新西兰共产党全国委员会向你们党的第八次代表大会致兄弟的祝贺。
    我们一直怀着敬慕的心情注视着你们在人民生活的各个方面所取得的十分伟大的成就。
    应该特别指出的是，你们的行动所产生的巨大影响一直是维护太平洋地区以及全世界和平的一个重大因素。
    我们新西兰参加了由美帝国主义所策划的东南亚条约组织，而这个组织是同指导你们与其他国家之间的关系的五项原则截然相反的。
    因此，我们面临着一项严重的任务，我们将坚决地加强我们的工作，动员新西兰人民，使我国脱离东南亚条约组织。
    我们将满怀信心地进行工作，争取我国同中华人民共和国之间建立外交关系，争取缔结一个以和平共处的五项原则为基础的公约。
    我们祝你们的大会在为和平、为中国人民的幸福和安全而进行的讨论中获得圆满的成功。
              新西兰共产党全国委员会
                总书记：威耳科克斯（签名）
    谢谢同志们。（附图片）
