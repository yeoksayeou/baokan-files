A Little Glimpse

    The Doctor's Diagnosis
    One day, I went to the No. 1 District Health Clinic in Nanjing to see a doctor. The doctor asked, "What's wrong?" I said, "Headache, stuffy nose, insomnia." He solemnly felt my pulse and said, "Headache, stuffy nose, that's a cold. You didn't cover yourself enough with the blanket. You must be careful to cover yourself more with the blanket in the future."
    "What about the insomnia?"
    "Insomnia is because you covered yourself too much with the blanket, which increased your burden, so you have insomnia. It doesn't matter, just be careful to cover yourself less with the blanket in the future, and it will naturally get better." Tu Shuliang

    医生的诊断
    一天，我去南京一区卫生所看病，医生问：“什么病？”我说：“头疼，鼻子不通，失眠”。他郑重地摸了摸我的脉，说：“头疼，鼻子不通，这是感冒。你少盖了被子，今后可得注意多盖被子。”
    “失眠呢？”
    “失眠嘛，是因为你多盖了被子，给你增加了负担，所以你就失眠了。没关系，以后注意少盖一些被子，自然就会好了。”　涂述良
