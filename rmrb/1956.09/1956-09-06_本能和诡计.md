    Instinct and Trickery
    A tiger always wants to eat meat; that's instinct. Colonialists always try every possible means to oppress people striving for independence; that can also be considered a kind of instinct.
    When talking about why he didn't use the word "internationalization" regarding the Suez Canal on August 28th, Dulles said: "That's because I'm perhaps instinctively trying to follow the suggestion I made earlier: to try to avoid using these big words to avoid causing some perhaps unnecessary conflicts."
    The "big words" that Dulles wanted to "instinctively" avoid, as he explained, were words like "colonialism" and "sovereignty," which are of great significance in resolving the Suez Canal issue. According to him, "If you can consider this issue with concrete and practical words, instead of those big words that cause psychological and prestige issues, we will be more likely to achieve a solution."
    Clearly, the colonialist instinct of Dulles prompted him to avoid those words that are extremely dangerous to colonialism, to avoid the word "internationalization" that is enough to expose the true nature of colonialism. It was also this greedy instinct that prompted him to come up with a trick, which is to use "management" and "use" these kinds of "concrete and practical words" to actually achieve the purpose of "internationalizing" the Suez Canal. And the "Dulles Plan" proposed by Dulles at the London conference, which is now being forced upon Egypt, fully embodies this instinct of his.
    It is said that foxes are very cunning because they can come up with all kinds of tricks under the impetus of the instinct to fill their stomachs and escape danger. However, compared to Mr. Dulles, the fox is much worse.
    However, Dulles also has something more unfortunate than the fox. After all, the fox only deals with birds and beasts, while Dulles has to deal with people, and conscious people at that. Despite Dulles' eloquence in avoiding the use of this or that "word," what's the use? People are not interested in the words Dulles uses; what people pay attention to is the colonialist blood basin that Dulles instinctively opens. (Dan)

### 本能和诡计

    本能和诡计
    老虎总是要吃肉的，这是本能。殖民主义者总是要想尽办法欺压争取独立的人民的，这也可说是一种本能。
    杜勒斯在8月28日谈到他为什么对苏彝士运河不使用“国际化”的字眼时说：“那是因为我也许是本能地在试图遵循我早些时候所提出的意见：设法避免使用这些大字眼以免造成一些或许是不必要的冲突。”
    杜勒斯所要“本能地”避免的“大字眼”，如他所说明的，就是“殖民主义”、“主权”这一类在解决苏彝士运河问题中具有重要意义的字眼。据他说，“如果你能够用具体实际的字眼来考虑这个问题，而不用那些会引起心理和威信性质问题的大字眼的话，我们是会更加易于取得解决的。”
    显然，杜勒斯的殖民主义者的本能，促使他避开那些对殖民主义危险万分的字眼，避开那个足以暴露殖民主义本相的“国际化”字眼。也正是这种贪婪的本能，促使他想出了一条诡计，这就是用“管理”、“使用”这类“具体、实际的字眼”，来实际上达到把苏彝士运河“国际化”的目的。而杜勒斯在伦敦会议上提出的，现在正在力图迫使埃及接受的“杜勒斯计划”，正是充分地体现了他的这种本能的东西。
    据说，狐狸是非常狡猾的，因为它在装饱肚子和逃避危险这种本能的推动之下，会想出各种各样的诡计。但是，和杜勒斯先生比起来，狐狸就差劲得多了。
    不过，杜勒斯也有他比狐狸不幸的地方。因为狐狸毕竟只同鸟兽打交道，而杜勒斯却要同人，而且是觉悟了的人打交道。尽管杜勒斯巧于辞令，避免使用这个或者那个“字眼”，但是这有什么用呢？人们并不对杜勒斯所使用的字眼感觉兴趣，人们注意的是杜勒斯本能地张开来的那张殖民主义者的血盆大口。　（丹）
