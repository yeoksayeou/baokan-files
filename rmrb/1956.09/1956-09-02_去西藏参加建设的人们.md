    Wen Lanxian's Dream Comes True
    Recently, more than fifty male and female middle school students from Hunan arrived at several hotels on Jinhua Street outside the North Gate of Chengdu. They are going to Tibet to participate in border construction. One day, I met Wen Lanxian, a nineteen-year-old female member of the Communist Youth League, here. She said that this was the second time she had requested to work in Tibet. The first time was in January last year, after seeing the oil painting "Spring in Tibet" by the painter Dong Xiwen and some books and periodicals about various constructions in Tibet, she went to the Hunan Provincial People's Committee to apply, but she was not approved because she was the only one. She told me a story about her application to go to Tibet this time: In July this year, the CPC Tibet Working Committee sent people to Changsha to recruit staff to enter Tibet, and she signed up again. At first, the recruitment staff said that her eyesight was nearsighted and not suitable for working in Tibet. She was anxious and angry at the time, so she said to them: "Zhang Daohua's eyes were blinded in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, but he can continue to work for the motherland. I am just a little nearsighted, why can't I do it? If I can't make a contribution to the Party and the people, what is the meaning of my life?" As a result, they approved her request.
    A comrade from the Personnel Section of the CPC Tibet Working Committee's Office in Sichuan told me that this year, there are eight groups of four hundred middle school students from Sichuan and Hunan who volunteered to work in Tibet. The vast majority of them are enthusiastic and simple young men and women between the ages of seventeen and twenty.
    The Determination of Demobilized Soldiers
    A few days ago, ninety-five demobilized soldiers from Nanchong County, Sichuan, left Chengdu to participate in construction work in Tibet. They are all veteran soldiers with five or six years of military service. Generally, they have participated in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea or the battles to liberate the coastal islands, and many of them have been awarded several times. After the implementation of the compulsory military service system nationwide, they were demobilized and returned home to participate in agricultural production. On the agricultural production front, many of them served as cadres in villages and agricultural production cooperatives. However, the training of past combat life made them always think of going to the most difficult place in the socialist construction of the motherland. Therefore, when they heard the call to participate in the construction work in Tibet, they all came to sign up.
    Before they set off for Tibet, they all wrote letters of determination. Almost every letter of determination swore, "Guarantee to strictly respect the customs and habits of the Tibetan people after arriving in Tibet, implement the Party's ethnic policies, strengthen the unity with the Tibetan people, and build the border of the motherland for a long time."
    One Thousand Five Hundred Construction Workers
    From January to August this year, one thousand five hundred carpenters, masons, stone masons, tilers, lumberjacks, and scaffolders went to Tibet to participate in construction. They came from seventeen counties and cities in Chongqing and Neijiang, Wenjiang, Nanchong and other regions.
    These construction workers all regarded participating in the construction work in Tibet as a glorious thing. I visited a young stonemason named Mo Sanwei. Mo Sanwei got married in January last year, and went to repair the Baoji-Chengdu Railway shortly after his marriage. After he finished repairing the Baoji-Chengdu Railway and returned home for only ten days, he signed up to participate in the work in Tibet. He told me that his mother initially couldn't bear him to go too far and disagreed with him going to Tibet. He used the reasoning that if Tibet is well built, the motherland will become more prosperous and powerful to persuade his mother. He also cited the example of his family suffering from hunger and cold before liberation, and having food and clothing after liberation, to move his mother, saying: "We should also help the Tibetan people live a happy life!" His mother finally agreed after his persuasion.

    去西藏参加建设的人们
  　新华社记者　王世晋
    文兰先的理想实现了
    在成都北门外金华街的几家旅馆里，最近从湖南来了五十多个男女中学生，他们是到西藏去参加边疆建设的。一天，我在这里会见了十九岁的女青年团员文兰先。她说她要求到西藏去工作这是第二次了。第一次是去年1月间，她看到画家董希文画的“春到西藏”的油画和关于西藏各项建设的一些书刊后，曾经到湖南省人民委员会去申请，当时因为只有她一个人，没有被批准。她告诉我这次申请去西藏时的一段故事：今年7月间，中共西藏工委派人到长沙招考进藏工作人员，她又去报了名。起初招考的工作人员说她眼睛近视，不适合在西藏工作。她当时又急又气，便向他们说：“张道华在抗美援朝中眼睛被打瞎了，还能继续为祖国工作，我只是眼睛有点近视，怎么就不行呢？我如果不能对党对人民有所贡献，我的生命还有什么意义呢？”结果他们批准了她的要求。
    在成都的中共西藏工委驻四川办事处人事科的一个同志告诉我，今年从四川、湖南志愿到西藏去工作的中学生，共有八批四百人，他们绝大多数都是十七岁到二十岁之间的热情、朴素的男女青年。
    复员军人的决心
    前几天有九十五名从四川南充县来的复员军人，离开成都到西藏参加建设工作去了。他们都是有五、六年军龄的老战士，一般都参加过抗美援朝或解放沿海岛屿的战斗，很多人都立过几次功。全国实行义务兵役制后，才复员回家参加农业生产。他们在农业生产战线上，有很多人当了村和农业生产合作社的干部。但是过去的战斗生活的锻炼，使得他们时刻想着到祖国社会主义建设最艰苦的地方去。因此，当他们听到号召参加西藏建设工作的时候，便都来报名了。
    他们在出发到西藏去之前，都写了决心书。差不多每份决心书上都宣誓，“保证到西藏后严格尊重藏族的风俗习惯，贯彻执行党的民族政策，加强和藏族人民的团结，长期建设祖国的边疆。”
    一千五百名建筑工人
    今年1月到8月，有一千五百个木工、泥工、石工、?工、伐木工、搭架工到西藏去参加建设，他们是从重庆市和内江、温江、南充等专区十七个县、市来的。
    这些建筑工人都把参加西藏建设工作，看成一件光荣的事情。我访问了一个名叫莫三威的青年石工。莫三威去年1月间结的婚，结婚不久就去修宝成铁路了，刚修完宝成铁路回家十来天，又报名去参加西藏工作。他告诉我，他的母亲起先舍不得他走得太远，不同意他去西藏。他便用西藏建设好了，祖国就会越发富强起来的道理劝说他的母亲。他还举出自己的家在解放前挨饿受冻，解放后有吃有穿的例子打动母亲说：“我们也应该帮助藏族人民过幸福的生活才对呀！”他的母亲经过他这样的劝说终于同意了。
