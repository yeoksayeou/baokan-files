Sukarno was the first to disembark from the plane, and Tito stepped forward to meet him. The two statesmen warmly shook hands.

Next, Sukarno exchanged greetings with those present, including Federal Executive Council Vice-Presidents Kardelj, Ranković, and Vukmanović, President of the Serbian National Assembly Stambolić, and Yugoslav State Secretary for National Defense Gošnjak, among others.

Sukarno and Tito then left the airport in an open-top car. The motorcade slowly drove through crowds waving flags and cheering. The route from the airport to Sukarno's residence was lined with the flags of both countries, and welcoming arches were erected.
