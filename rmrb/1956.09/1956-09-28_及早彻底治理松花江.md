Speech by Comrade Qiang Xiaochu, Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Heilongjiang Provincial Committee

In view of the importance of industrial and agricultural production in the Songhua River basin and its broad prospects for development, in view of the lessons learned from the huge losses caused by previous floods, and taking into account the nation's economic strength and other conditions, it is recommended that the Central Government take the governance of the Songhua River as the first step in the overall water conservancy construction of the Heilongjiang River basin and include it in the country's Second Five-Year Plan, adopting a combination of fundamental and temporary solutions and combining national strength with the strength of the masses to gradually complete this work.

I wholeheartedly endorse Comrade Mao Zedong's opening address and fully agree with the Central Committee's reports, the draft Party Constitution, and the draft proposals for the Second Five-Year Plan. Now I would like to talk about some opinions on governing the Songhua River. This is a problem closely related to the overall economic construction of the vast area of northeastern China.

The main stream of the Songhua River and its main tributary, the Nen River, are about 2,000 kilometers long within Heilongjiang Province. The area of its basin, including neighboring areas, is more than 500,000 square kilometers. In this vast area, there are more than 150 million mu of fertile land, dense forests and abundant mineral deposits. On the banks of the Songhua and Nen Rivers are important industrial cities such as Harbin, Qiqihar, Jiamusi, and some neighboring areas. However, in this vast and rich area, it has been subjected to more and more and bigger and bigger flood threats. In the 47 years since hydrological records began, there have been seven major floods, averaging more than once every six years, three of which have occurred in the last six years, and floods have increased to an average of once every two years. The flood in August this year exceeded all high water levels in historical records. Taking Harbin as an example, the water level was as high as 120.06 meters (Dalian elevation), exceeding the water level when Harbin was flooded in 1932 (119.72 meters) by 34 centimeters, with a peak flow of 13,000 cubic meters per second. This serious trend, the threat and damage to urban and rural production and people's lives along the river, cannot but arouse our great attention.

Since liberation, although due to the beginning of the founding of the country, there was no time or economic means to thoroughly manage the Songhua River, under the correct leadership of the Central Government, we organized the strength of the masses and carried out a lot of work. 575 kilometers of dikes were built and initially renovated on the main stream of the Songhua River, and a large number of folk dikes were also built on some tributaries, thus overcoming the floods of 1951 and 1953, basically ensuring the safety of industrial and agricultural production and the lives and property of millions of people along the river. This year's flood, although the largest in historical records and arrived half a month to twenty days earlier than in previous years, with rivers rising together and the water being fierce, and the high water level lasting for a long time, but under the leadership and close care of the Central Government, and with the strong support of brotherly provinces and cities and the People's Liberation Army, we urgently mobilized the people along the river and organized an army of 300,000 to 500,000 people every day to repair and protect the dikes, led by leading cadres of the Party, government, and military at all levels, fighting day and night for more than twenty days, and finally defending all the large and small cities and most of the farmland along the river. This is in stark contrast to the tragic situation in 1932 when Harbin, Yilan and other cities and a large number of farmland and villages were flooded during the Japanese puppet rule. Therefore, the people showed a high degree of trust in the Party and the government.

However, because this year's flood was too fierce, and our dikes were not only insufficient in height and thickness, but also had many hidden dangers, coupled with the fact that we underestimated the situation in advance in our leadership and failed to make adequate preparations, some dikes were still breached. Due to this flood plus waterlogging, about 700,000 hectares of land in the province were flooded. Crop production may be reduced by about 700,000 tons as a result (but this year's total output may still exceed last year's and may complete the 9 million ton production plan). In addition, 40,000 houses were flooded or collapsed, and 380,000 people were seriously affected, requiring the government to arrange relief and organize production for self-relief. During the flood period, some railway traffic was once interrupted, and some industrial enterprises temporarily stopped production to participate in rescuing the dangerous dikes. Millions of workdays were spent in repairing dikes and rescuing dangers, and a large amount of equipment and materials were used. According to preliminary estimates, the direct and indirect losses amounted to as much as 300 million yuan. This has prompted us to further realize the urgent need to thoroughly manage the Songhua River as soon as possible.

In view of the importance of industrial and agricultural production in the entire Songhua River basin and its broad prospects for development, and in view of the lessons learned from the huge losses caused by previous floods, and taking into account the nation's economic strength and other conditions, we recommend that the Central Government take the governance of the Songhua River as the first step in the overall water conservancy construction of the Heilongjiang River basin and include it in the country's Second Five-Year Plan, adopting a combination of fundamental and temporary solutions and combining national strength with the strength of the masses to gradually complete this work.

In view of the fact that the main reason for the increasing floods in the Songhua River is that the rainfall is too concentrated (rainfall in July and August accounts for 60 to 80 percent of the annual rainfall), and the amount of water from the upper reaches and tributaries is too large during the flood season, in order to alleviate the threat of floods during the flood season, a number of reservoirs must be built in phases on the main stream and tributaries of the Songhua River. The Heilongjiang Provincial Party Committee has already drafted a plan, suggesting that eleven reservoirs of various sizes should be gradually built in the Songhua River basin, and efforts should be made to first build four reservoirs during the Second Five-Year Plan period, namely Kumotun on the main stream of the Nen River, Wu'erke on the Nemin River tributary, Taoshan on the Lalin River, and Heishizhen or Hongshilaizi in the upper reaches of Fengman. These reservoirs will also have great value for power generation, irrigation, fish farming, and navigation, and will also create water source conditions for the future Songliao Canal. Considering that the fundamental solutions will not show their effects until a few years later, it is also necessary to actively carry out temporary solutions at the same time. Our province is planning to build and renovate dikes that are sufficient to prevent floods as large as or even larger than this year's, and plans to complete the repair of regular dikes along the river before the flood season next year, and plans to convert some important folk dikes into regular dikes. In order to ensure the safety of the industrial city of Harbin, we are also preparing to build a necessary number of cement dikes along the river in Harbin. At the same time, we also hope that the Fengman Reservoir can better pay attention to its role in regulating floods during the flood season.

In view of the fact that the fundamental reason for the increasing number of floods in the Songhua River is soil erosion, in the future, forest logging should develop new forest areas in a planned manner, prevent excessive concentration of logging, and quickly renew the logged areas, and actively do a good job in soil and water conservation. Necessary dredging work should also be carried out in areas where rivers are silting up.

In order to do a good job in thoroughly managing the Songhua River, we suggest that under the leadership of the State Planning Commission, relevant departments and relevant provinces and regions should be organized to jointly study and comprehensively plan, and establish a special agency to engage in this work.

Under the leadership of our Party, our country has been and is carrying out tremendous work that predecessors have never done in transforming nature for the benefit of the people. Before our Party and people, it is truly "high mountains also have to bow their heads, and rivers also have to give way." We believe that under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong and the active efforts of the people, the Songhua River will surely, like other rivers in our country, docilely serve the country and the people.

    及早彻底治理松花江
    中共黑龙江省委员会书记　强晓初同志的发言
    鉴于松花江流域工农业生产的重要性和它的广阔的发展前途，鉴于历次水患所造成的巨大损失的教训，同时考虑到国家的经济力量和其他条件，建议中央把治理松花江的问题作为整个黑龙江流域水利建设的第一步，并将其列入国家的第二个五年计划之内，采取治本与治标相结合和国家力量与群众力量相结合的方针，逐步地完成这一工作。
    我衷心拥护毛泽东同志的开幕词，完全同意中央委员会的各项报告和党章草案以及关于第二个五年计划的建议草案。现在我想讲一点关于治理松花江的意见。这是和我国东北北部广大地区的整个经济建设密切相关的一个问题。
    松花江干流及其主要支流嫩江，在黑龙江省境内共长约两千公里。其流域面积如果加上邻区约达五十多万平方公里。在这个广大地区内有一亿五千多万亩肥沃的土地，有茂密的森林和丰富的矿藏，在松花江及嫩江的岸边，有哈尔滨、齐齐哈尔、佳木斯及邻区的一些重要工业城市。但是，就在这个广阔而又富饶的地区里，却遭到了愈来愈多和愈来愈大的洪水的威胁。在有水文记载以来的四十七年中，先后曾发生过七次较大的洪水，平均为六年多一次，其中三次都是在最近六年间发生的，水患已增多到平均两年一次。今年八月间的洪水超过了有历史记录以来的所有的高水位。以哈尔滨为例，水位高达一百二十点零六公尺（大连海拔），超过一九三二年水淹哈尔滨时的水位（一百一十九点七二公尺）三十四公分，最高流量达一万三千秒公方。这种严重趋势，对沿江城乡生产和人民生活的威胁和破坏，不能不引起我们极大的注意。
    自解放以来，虽然由于建国伊始，在时间上和经济上一时还没有来得及对松花江进行根治，但在中央的正确领导下，我们组织群众力量，进行了大量的工作。在松花江干流修建与初步整理了五百七十五公里堤坝，在一些支流上也有重点地修建了大量的民堤，因而战胜了一九五一年和一九五三年的洪水，基本上保障了沿江工农业生产和千百万人民生命财产的安全。今年的洪水，尽管是有历史记载以来最大的，并且比往年提早半月至二十天到来，江河齐涨，水势凶猛，高水位持续时间较长，但在中央领导和密切关怀下，在兄弟省市和人民解放军的大力支援下，我们紧急地动员了沿江人民，每天组织三十到五十万人的修堤护堤大军，由各级党、政、军领导干部亲自率领，夜以继日地搏斗了二十余昼夜，终于保卫住了沿江一切大小城市和绝大部分的农田。这和日伪统治时一九三二年水淹哈尔滨、依兰等城市与大量农田、村庄的惨状，形成了明显的对照。因此，人民群众对党和政府表现了高度的信任。
    但是，由于今年的洪水过于凶猛，而我们的堤坝不仅高度、厚度不够，且有不少险工隐患，加之我们领导上事先对情况估计不足，未能作好充分的准备，因此仍有一些堤坝漫决。由于这次洪水加上内涝，全省共淹地七十万公顷左右。农作物可能因此减产约七十万吨（但今年总产量仍可超过去年，并可能完成九百万吨产量计划）。另外尚有四万间房屋被淹或倒塌，重灾人口达三十八万，需要政府安排救济与组织生产自救。在洪水时期，有些铁路交通曾一度中断，部分工业企业曾因参加抢救险堤而短时间停止生产。在修堤抢险中用了上千万个工日，使用了大量的器材物资。据初步推算，其直接与间接损失约达三亿元之巨。这就促使我们进一步认识到及早彻底治理松花江的迫切需要。
    鉴于松花江整个流域工农业生产的重要性和它的广阔的发展前途，并鉴于历次水患所造成的巨大损失的教训，同时考虑到国家的经济力量和其他条件，我们建议中央把治理松花江的问题作为整个黑龙江流域水利建设的第一步，并将其列入国家的第二个五年计划之内，采取治本与治标相结合和国家力量与群众力量相结合的方针，逐步地完成这一工作。
    鉴于松花江水患的主要原因是雨量过于集中（七、八月份降雨量占全年降雨量百分之六十到八十），汛期上游和支流水量过大，为解除汛期的洪水威胁，必须在松花江干流与支流上分期建立若干水库。黑龙江省委已经拟出了一个方案，建议在松花江流域逐步修建大小十一个水库，并争取在第二个五年计划期间先修建嫩江本流库漠屯、支流诺敏河乌尔科、拉林河桃山及丰满上游黑石镇或红石砬子等四个水库，这些水库建成后，对于发电、灌溉、养鱼、航运也有很大价值，还可为将来松辽运河创造水源条件。考虑到治本需要几年后才能表现其效果，还必须同时积极进行治标工作。我省正在规划修建和整理足以防止今年这样大的或者更大一些的洪水为目标的堤坝，计划于明年汛期前，除完成沿江正规堤的修整任务外，并拟将一些重要民堤改修为正规堤。为了保证工业城市哈尔滨的安全，还准备在哈尔滨沿江修建必要数量的洋灰堤坝。同时，我们还希望丰满水库能够在汛期更好地注意发挥其调节洪水的作用。
    鉴于松花江水患愈来愈多的根本原因是水土流失，因此，今后采伐森林，应该有计划地开发新林区，防止过分集中采伐，并把采伐迹地很快地更新起来，积极地做好水土保持工作。在河道淤积的地方，还应进行必要的疏浚工作。
    为了作好根治松花江的工作，我们建议在国家计划委员会领导下，组织有关部门和有关省、区，共同研究，全面规划，并设立专门机构从事此项工作。
    在我们党的领导下，我国在改造自然为人民兴利除弊方面，已经和正在进行着前人所没有作过的巨大的工作，在我们党和人民的面前，真是“高山也要低头，河水也要让路”。我们相信在党中央和毛泽东同志的英明领导和人民群众的积极努力下，松花江必将和我国其他的河流一样，驯顺地为国家和人民服务。
