Xinhua News Agency, 30th. Prague, 30th (TASS): The Secretariat of the World Federation of Trade Unions issued a statement on August 29, protesting against the West German authorities' infringement of the democratic rights of the working people.

    The statement pointed out that recently, the monopoly capitalists of West Germany have been attempting to abolish the right to strike, implement compulsory government arbitration, and restrict freedom of employment, in short, doing everything possible to clear the way for attacks on the vital rights of workers.

    The statement said that the World Federation of Trade Unions believes that the banning of the German Communist Party and several other democratic organizations is a very heavy blow to the interests of the German working people and the cause of peaceful reunification of Germany. Workers remember that the banning of the German Communist Party in 1933 was followed by the horrors of fascism and war. This action led to the abolition of independent trade unions and all democratic organizations. Therefore, the World Federation of Trade Unions, representing its 85 million members, protests against the West German authorities' acts of undermining democracy and freedom.

    The World Federation of Trade Unions calls on all working people in Europe and around the world to heighten their vigilance in the face of the danger of the revival of German militarism. The World Federation of Trade Unions calls on them to give greater support to the working people of the Federal Republic of Germany to defend peace, democracy and progress.

    世界工联发表声明
    抗议西德当局破坏民主自由
    号召给予西德劳动人民以更大的声援
    新华社30日讯　据塔斯社布拉格30日讯：世界工会联合会书记处8月29日发表声明，抗议西德当局侵犯劳动人民的民主权利。
    声明指出，最近以来，西德的垄断资本家们一直在企图取消罢工权利、实施政府的强迫仲裁、限制就业自由，总而言之，竭力为进攻工人的切身权利扫清道路。
    声明说，世界工会联合会认为取缔德国共产党和若干其他民主组织是对德国劳动人民的利益和和平统一德国的事业的一个很沉重的打击。工人们记得，随着1933年禁止德国共产党而来的是法西斯主义和战争的恐怖。这个行动导致了独立的工会和所有的民主组织的废除。因此世界工会联合会代表它的八千五百万会员抗议西德当局破坏民主和自由的行为。
    世界工会联合会号召欧洲和全世界一切劳动人民在德国军国主义复活的危险面前提高他们的警惕。世界工会联合会号召他们给予德意志联邦共和国的劳动人民以更大的声援，来保卫和平、民主和进步。
