Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, 11th - The Standing Committee of the Pakistan Muslim People's Organization expressed deep anxiety at a meeting here on the 9th regarding the large-scale gathering of troops by Britain and France. The Standing Committee, in its resolution, stated that the use of force against Egypt in an attempt to resolve the Suez Canal issue would inevitably cause extremely serious reactions throughout the Muslim world.
The resolution also stated that if the worst were to happen, Britain and France must bear full responsibility for it.
Xinhua News Agency, September 11th - New York dispatch: Ahmed, the representative of the Algerian nationalist organization in the United States, wrote to the "New York Times" saying, "(French Prime Minister) Mollet and his Governor-General in Algeria are frantically trying to divert attention from the evident failure of the (French) 'pacification' plan," and that they are "desperately seizing on an unrelated issue - the Egyptian government's nationalization of the Suez Canal - to clamor for war, clearly to cover up the failure of policies in Algeria and to deceive the French people."

    巴穆斯林人民组织警告英法不要黩武
    阿尔及利亚民族主义者斥法政府战争叫嚣
    新华社喀喇蚩11日电　巴基斯坦穆斯林人民组织常务委员会九日在这里举行的一次会议上对英国和法国大规模集结兵力这件事表示深切的焦虑。这个常务委员会在它的决议中说，对埃及使用武力以图解决苏彝士运河问题的做法不可避免地将在整个穆斯林世界引起极严重的反应。
    这个决议还说，如果不幸发生了最坏的事情，英国和法国对此必须负全部责任。
    新华社11日讯　纽约消息：在美国的阿尔及利亚民族主义组织的代表艾哈迈德写信给“纽约时报”说，“（法国总理）摩勒和他驻阿尔及利亚的总督正在疯狂地企图转移人们对（法国在阿尔及利亚）施行‘绥靖’计划遭到明显失败的注意”，他们正在“拚命抓住一个无关的问题——埃及政府把苏彝士运河收回国有的问题——来叫嚣战争，这显然是要掩饰在阿尔及利亚的政策的失败，并且要蒙蔽法国人民。”
