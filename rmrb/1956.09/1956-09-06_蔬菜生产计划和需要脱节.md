Vegetable Supply and Production Work Must Be Improved Simultaneously
Editor's Note: The current urban vegetable problem involves many aspects of work. A few days ago, this newspaper published opinions from Beijing citizens and suburban Beijing vegetable farmers regarding vegetable supply work. Today, we are publishing information on vegetable production and opinions from vegetable purchasing agents of some institutional mess halls in Beijing, so that everyone can have a better understanding of the vegetable problem. The problem of insufficient vegetable supply not only exists in Beijing, but also in some other cities. If Beijing can solve this problem well, it will also help other cities solve the vegetable problem.

    Vegetable Production Plans and Needs Disconnected

    The reason why Beijing failed to do a good job in vegetable supply in the past, in addition to the management problems that have been exposed, there are also some problems in vegetable production. Of course, these production problems are also interconnected and mutually influential with management problems. Here, I will talk about what I know about vegetable production.

    A very prominent problem is that vegetable production cooperatives have not, according to market needs and the characteristics of vegetable production, planned and balanced production arrangements well. Taking Beijing's spring vegetables this year as an example, the actual planting quantity of tomatoes, rapeseed, cucumbers, and radishes exceeded the plan. For tomatoes, the target set by the Municipal Agriculture and Forestry Bureau was to plant more than 4,000 mu, but the actual planting was more than 5,000 mu. The planting of rapeseed exceeded the original plan by 20%. Some varieties, however, did not meet the plan. For garlic, the plan was to plant more than 5,000 mu, but only more than 3,000 mu were planted. The plan was to plant more than 1,000 mu of lettuce, but only more than 500 mu were planted. Scallions, winter melon, chives, and other crops also failed to meet the planting plan. Vegetable production cooperatives in various districts have this phenomenon of not planting according to plan. Among the 24 kinds of spring vegetables planted by the Dongfanghong Production Cooperative, 12 exceeded the plan, and 12 did not complete the plan. The planning of sowing is also very poor. The Haidian District arranged for the Hongqi Cooperative to sow 65 mu of radishes, requiring 25 mu to be planted before Qingming, 9 mu before Guyu, and 14 mu during Guyu; but this cooperative planted all of them during Qingming. In this way, it is easy to create a situation where some vegetables are out of stock in the market and some vegetables are overstocked.

    One of the reasons for the poor planning of vegetable production is that the departments leading vegetable production in Beijing have not issued the planned targets for vegetable planting in a timely and accurate manner. Beijing's 1956 vegetable planting plan was not deployed to the districts until the end of January this year, and the districts did not deploy it to the townships until early February. Some cooperatives had already made arrangements for production before receiving the plan, and some early-maturing crops had already begun to be planted. The departments that formulate the plan are not familiar with the market supply and demand situation, the specific conditions of each vegetable production cooperative, and planting habits, and the plans they formulate are often divorced from reality. Some plans are too specific and cumbersome, which adds a lot of unnecessary trouble to the lower levels. Facts have proved that it is unrealistic for Beijing to plan to plant more than 1,000 mu of lettuce this year - the plan was only completed by more than one-third, and there is already a backlog in the market. The Dongfanghong Cooperative used to have the habit of planting early-maturing eggplants, but the district did not allocate a single mu to them. Many cooperatives reported that it was not appropriate for them to plant Guyu radishes, because when Guyu radishes are harvested, Chinese cabbage is already on the market in large quantities, which can easily lead to overstocking.

    Another reason for the poor planning of vegetable production is that vegetable production cooperatives consider their own temporary interests more and consider market needs and long-term interests less. This year's tomatoes and cucumbers exceeded the plan by a large margin, while late-autumn crops generally failed to meet the plan, which is an example. The Hongshiyue Cooperative in Fengtai District used to have the habit of planting coriander and carrots, but this year they felt that the cost was high and the labor was large, so they did not plant them.

    Judging from the situation in the first half of the year, the planning of vegetables to be marketed after maturity is also very poor, and the amount on the market fluctuates greatly. The Dongfanghong Cooperative planned to put more than 2 million jin of cabbage on the market in June, but only more than 900,000 jin were put on the market. The amount on the market every ten days and every day is also very uneven. In the first ten days of May, the Dongfanghong Cooperative planned to put more than 100,000 jin of Chinese cabbage on the market, but more than 300,000 jin were put on the market; in the three days from the 8th to the 10th, more than 170,000 jin were put on the market continuously.

    This kind of blind marketing without considering needs is related to the implementation of unified purchase and marketing of vegetables. Since the vegetables were purchased by the Vegetable Company, the cooperatives have not been concerned about the promotion of vegetables. When the time comes, they will pull the vegetables to the vegetable station, and their task is completed. Before June, the vast majority of cooperatives did not have a director or deputy director specifically responsible for sales. The Siqijin Cooperative has six directors and deputy directors, but none of them are in charge of sales. In addition, the cooperatives also have the idea of "catching the market." In order to "catch the market," the Hongshiyue Cooperative put 120,000 jin on the market in one day, and even picked and sent immature vegetables. This spring, because the Vegetable Company stipulated that the price of green garlic was 6 cents per jin and the price of garlic heads was 8 cents per jin (too low), the farmers pulled out a large amount of green garlic to catch the market, causing a serious backlog and rot of green garlic on the market for a while; in the later stage, there was a long-term shortage because there was no garlic to pull. The Vegetable Company's failure to purchase from the cooperatives according to the signed contract also promoted the unplanned nature of vegetable marketing. When vegetables are in short supply, the company only needs the cooperatives to deliver the goods, regardless of whether there is a plan; when the peak season arrives and a large number of vegetables are on the market, the company asks the cooperatives for a marketing plan.

    There is also a prominent problem in vegetable production - the quality of vegetables has been greatly reduced compared to the past. This year, in the peak season, a large number of vegetables were on the market, but consumers generally reported that the quality of vegetables had declined. In the past, each cucumber weighed about four or five liang, and most of them were topped with flowers and thorns, fresh and delicious; this year, each cucumber weighed about one jin, and some even weighed two jin and twelve liang. The quality of other vegetables has also generally declined. The packaging of vegetables is also not as good as in the past. When packing eggplants, in the past, they were placed in the basket one by one, but now they are dumped into the basket in piles. Some vegetables are not washed clean, and there are insects and mud in the vegetables. The decline in the quality of vegetables is also related to the implementation of unified purchase and marketing of vegetables. The cooperatives saw that all vegetables could be sold by the Vegetable Company and were not afraid of not being able to sell them, so they developed the idea of only pursuing quantity and not quality in production.

### 蔬菜生产计划和需要脱节

    蔬菜的供应工作和生产工作须同时改进
    编者按　当前的城市蔬菜问题牵涉到好些方面的工作。几天前，本报曾经发表了北京市民和北京郊区菜农对蔬菜供应工作的意见。今天，再把蔬菜生产方面的情况和北京一些机关伙食单位的蔬菜采买员的意见发表出来，以便使大家对蔬菜问题有进一步的了解。蔬菜供应不足问题不只是在北京市存在着，在别的一些城市也有类似的情况。北京市如能很好地解决这个问题，对其它城市解决蔬菜问题也会有帮助的。
    蔬菜生产计划和需要脱节
    北京市过去没做好蔬菜供应工作，其原因，除了已经揭发的经营管理上的问题以外，在蔬菜生产中也还有一些问题。当然，这些生产上的问题，又是和经营管理上的问题互相联系、互相影响的。这里谈一谈我所了解到的蔬菜生产的情况。
    很突出的一个问题，是蔬菜生产合作社没有很好地根据市场的需要和蔬菜生产的特点，有计划地均衡地安排生产。拿北京市今春的蔬菜来说，实际种植的数量超过计划的就有西红柿、油菜、黄瓜、水萝卜等。西红柿，市农林局下达的计划指标是种四千多亩，实际种了五千多亩。种植的油菜，超过原计划20％。有些品种却没有完成计划。大蒜，计划种五千多亩，只种了三千多亩。莴笋计划种一千多亩，只种了五百多亩。大葱、冬瓜、韭菜等也都没有完成种植计划。各个区的蔬菜生产合作社，都有这种不按计划种植的现象。东方红生产合作社种植的二十四种春菜，有十二种超过计划，有十二种没完成计划。在安排播种上，计划性也很差。海淀区布置红旗合作社播种六十五亩小萝卜，要求在清明种二十五亩，谷雨前种九亩，谷雨种十四亩；但这个社竟都在清明播种了。这样，就容易造成市场上有些蔬菜脱销有些蔬菜积压的情况。
    蔬菜生产计划性差，原因之一，是北京市领导蔬菜生产的部门，没有及时而准确地下达种植蔬菜的计划指标。北京市1956年的蔬菜种植计划，今年1月底才布置到区，区布置到乡已经是2月初了。有些合作社，在接到计划以前，已对生产作了安排，有些早熟作物已开始种植了。制定计划的部门，对市场的供求情况，各个蔬菜生产合作社的具体条件、种植习惯等不熟悉，制定的计划往往脱离实际。有些计划因过于具体烦琐，也给下面添了许多不必要的麻烦。事实证明，北京市今年计划种莴笋一千多亩是不切合实际的——这计划只完成了三分之一多，而市场上已形成积压。东方红合作社过去有种早熟茄子的习惯，但区里一亩也没分给他们。许多合作社反映，要它们种谷雨小萝卜是不适宜的，因当谷雨小萝卜收获时，小白菜已经大量上市，容易形成积压。
    蔬菜生产计划性差的另一个原因，是蔬菜生产合作社从本身的一时的利益方面考虑的多，从市场的需要方面和长远的利益方面设想的少。今年的西红柿、黄瓜超过计划较多，而晚秋作物普遍完不成计划，就是一例。丰台区红十月合作社过去有种香菜、胡萝卜的习惯，今年嫌成本高、费工大，就没种。
    从上半年情况看来，蔬菜成熟后上市的计划性也很差，上市量忽多忽少。东方红合作社，6月份计划洋白菜上市二百多万斤，结果只上了九十多万斤。每旬、每日的上市量也极不均衡。东方红合作社5月上旬，计划上市小白菜十万多斤，结果却上了三十万斤多；在八日到十日的三天中，就接连上市十七万多斤。
    这种不根据需要盲目上市的情况，是同对蔬菜实行统购包销有关系的。自从蔬菜由蔬菜公司统购以后，合作社就不关心蔬菜的推销工作了，到时候把菜拉到菜站，就算自己的任务完成了。6月份前，绝大多数合作社，没有专门负责推销工作的主任或副主任。四季青合作社，有正副主任六人，没一个人主管推销工作。此外，合作社还有“赶行市”的思想。红十月合作社，为了“赶行市”，一天就上市十二万斤，甚至把没有成熟的蔬菜也摘了送去。今春，由于蔬菜公司规定青蒜每斤价六分，蒜头每斤价八分（太低），菜农就把大量青蒜拔了赶市，造成市场上青蒜一时严重的积压和腐烂；而后期则因无蒜可拔而形成长期脱销。蔬菜公司没有按所签合同向合作社收购，也促进了蔬菜上市的无计划性。蔬菜缺乏的时候，公司只要合作社送货就行，不问有没有计划；旺季到来，蔬菜大量上市的时候，公司才向合作社要上市的计划。
    在蔬菜生产中，还有一个突出的问题——蔬菜的质量比过去大大降低了。今年旺季，蔬菜大量上市，可是消费者普遍反映蔬菜质量下降。往年黄瓜每条约重四、五两，多者半斤，而且大都顶花带刺、鲜美可口；今年黄瓜每条约重一斤左右，有的竟有二斤十二两重。别的蔬菜的质量也普遍下降。在蔬菜的包装上，也没有过去好了。装茄子，过去是一个一个往筐里放，现在是一堆一堆往筐里倒。有些蔬菜洗得不干净，菜里有虫，有泥。蔬菜质量下降，也是同对蔬菜实行统购包销相联的。合作社看到所有蔬菜都可以由蔬菜公司包销，不怕没销路，在生产中就产生了只求数量不求质量的思想。　刘毅
