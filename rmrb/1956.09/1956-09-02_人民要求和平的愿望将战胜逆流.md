    The West German Adenauer ruling clique's announcement that the German Communist Party is illegal and its violent persecution has aroused boundless indignation among peace-loving Chinese women. It is very clear that this despicable and malicious measure by the Adenauer group, encouraged and supported by the American monopoly capitalist group, is a re-enactment of Hitler's ambition to "conquer" the world. It is not only a tyrannical trampling on the freedom and democratic rights of the West German people, but also an act that further threatens world peace.
    Chinese women cannot forget the disasters that Hitler's aggressive adventures brought to women and mothers. Tens of thousands of warm families were torn apart, how many mothers lost their children forever, how many women became lonely widows, the heavy wounds of losing loved ones have not yet healed, and the homes destroyed by the war need to be rebuilt. Today, what the West German people and women are praying for is to be able to reunite with their loved ones, live peaceful lives, and restore the unity of the German nation on the basis of peace and democracy. Especially mothers, they demand that their precious children, whom they have painstakingly raised, can grow up in a peaceful environment. However, the Adenauer group has chosen a path that is completely contrary to the demands of the German people. Today, the Adenauer group's banning of the German Communist Party and its frantic persecution of peaceful and democratic forces is precisely to clear the way for large-scale arms expansion and war preparation, and wants to plunge the West German people and women into the abyss of death and destruction again.
    But the Adenauer group's calculation is wrong. Those who are determined to be enemies of the people can never escape the final judgment of the people. The West German people and women, who have an excellent fighting tradition of pursuing freedom, peace, and democracy, must have the strength to defeat these reactionary measures that destroy your peaceful lives. Your struggle is not isolated, and the people and women of China firmly support your struggle. All righteous people around the world will also support you with all their strength. Today is an era when the power of the people is sufficient to control their own destiny, and the people's desire for peace has gathered into an unstoppable torrent. We firmly believe that victory will surely belong to the people who are fighting for peace and justice.

    人民要求和平的愿望将战胜逆流
  　李德全
    西德阿登纳统治集团宣布德国共产党为非法并加以暴力迫害的事件，激起了热爱和平的中国妇女无比的愤慨。很明显，在美国垄断资本集团鼓励和支持下的阿登纳集团的这一卑鄙恶毒措施，是希特勒“征服”世界野心的事件的重演，它不仅仅是对西德人民自由和民主权利横暴的摧残，也是进一步威胁世界和平的行为。
    中国妇女不能忘记由于希特勒的侵略冒险所带给妇女和母亲们的灾难。成千成万温暖的家庭被拆散，多少的母亲永远失去了她们的孩子，多少的妇女变成了孤单的寡妇，失去亲人的沉重创伤尚未平复，被战争破坏无遗的家园需要从整。今天西德人民和妇女所祈求的是能够和亲人们团聚，过和平的生活，在和平民主的基础上恢复德意志国家的统一。特别是母亲们，她们要求千辛万苦抚育的宝贵的孩子们，能够在和平的环境中成长。然而阿登纳集团选择的是与德国人民要求完全相反的道路，今天阿登纳集团禁止德国共产党和残酷的迫害和平民主力量的疯狂行为，正是为大规模的扩军备战扫清道路，想把西德人民和妇女重新卷入死亡和毁灭的深渊。
    但是阿登纳集团的算盘打错了。决心与人民为敌的人，从来不能逃避人民最后的裁判。有着追求自由、和平与民主的优秀的战斗传统的西德人民和妇女，一定有力量击溃这些破坏你们和平生活的反动措施。你们的斗争不是孤立的，中国的人民和妇女在坚决支持你们的斗争。全世界正义的人们也将以全力支持你们。今天是人民的力量已经足以掌握自己的命运的时代，人民要求和平的愿望已经汇聚成为一股不可阻挡的洪流。我们深信，胜利必将属于为和平与正义而斗争的人们。
