Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, September 9th: Pakistani Prime Minister Mohammed Ali submitted his resignation on the afternoon of September 8th and withdrew from the Muslim League.

Prime Minister Ali convened a cabinet meeting in the evening. He later left Karachi for Domloti to spend the weekend. He will return from there on September 10th.

Two members of the United Front in the central cabinet – Minister of Health K.K. Dutta and Minister of Economic Affairs Akdas – joined the Republican Party on the 8th. It is expected that more central ministers from East Pakistan will do the same.

According to a report by the Pakistan United Press, a senior figure said that Mohammed Ali has clearly refused to join the Republican Party. However, it is not impossible for Ali to lead a new cabinet as an independent.

News came on the evening of the 8th that the President may ask Mohammed Ali, as the leader of the United Party, to form the next government.

Many Republicans and other leading figures also issued statements yesterday suggesting that the President ask Mohammed Ali to form a new cabinet.

    阿里辞去巴基斯坦总理职务并退出穆斯林联盟
    据新华社喀喇蚩9日电　巴基斯坦总理穆罕默德·阿里在9月8日下午提出辞呈，并且退出了穆斯林联盟。
    阿里总理在晚间曾经召集内阁会议。他后来离开喀喇蚩前往多姆洛提去度周末。他将在9月10日从那里回来。
    中央内阁中的两个联合阵线的阁员——卫生部长克·克·达塔和经济部长阿克·达斯8日参加了共和党。预料来自东巴基斯坦的中央各部长还有更多的人会这样作。
    据巴基斯坦联合通讯社报道，一位高级人士说，穆罕默德·阿里已经明确地拒绝参加共和党。但是，阿里并不是没有可能以无党派人士领导一个新内阁的。
    8日晚上有消息说，总统可能要求穆罕默德·阿里作为联合党的领袖组织下一届的政府。
  许多共和党人和其他的领导人物也在昨天发表声明，建议总统要求穆罕默德·阿里组织新内阁。
