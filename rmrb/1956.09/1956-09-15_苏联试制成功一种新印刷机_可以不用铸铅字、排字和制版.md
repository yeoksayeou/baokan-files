Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 14th: According to "Izvestia," a Soviet professor has completed the initial trial production of a completely new type of printing press. Using this machine to print books and periodicals can completely eliminate the labor-intensive processes currently used in the printing industry, such as casting type, typesetting, and plate making.

"Izvestia" says that the invention of this machine "will open a new page in the history of printing."

Professor Zhilevich of the Vilnius Pedagogical Institute of the Lithuanian Republic, the inventor of the new printing press, utilized the principles of the latest achievements in modern electrical engineering, such as recording methods, facsimile transmission, and electronic computers, in the design and trial production of this printing press. The new printing press is equipped with a facsimile transmitter, an oscilloscope, a tape recorder, and a magnetic film mounted on the printing press drum. This magnetic film is recorded, positioned, and fixed in the tape recorder. The facsimile transmitter decomposes the images of words and pictures on the manuscript into continuous electrical pulses, which are then used to magnetize the magnetic film, so that a "magnetic image" of the newspaper or book can be printed on the film, fixing the entire newspaper or entire book on the film.

When the printing press drum rotates, the magnetic field of the magnetic film already fixed on it penetrates the paper close to it, transferring the entire image to the paper. At the same time, a paint sprayer on the printing press sprays a fine powdered magnetic paint onto the rotating paper roll, highlighting the areas where the magnetic field passes through the paper, making the text visible. Subsequently, a heated roller gently rolls over the paper, fixing the paint. At this point, printed materials come out of the machine one after another.

The new printing press trial-produced by Professor Zhilevich has received attention from relevant Soviet departments.

    苏联试制成功一种新印刷机
    可以不用铸铅字、排字和制版
    新华社莫斯科14日电　据“消息报”报道：一位苏联教授初步试制成功一种完全新型的印刷机。用这种机器来印刷书刊的时候，完全可以省去目前印刷业中铸铅字、排字、制版等花费劳动很多的工序。
      “消息报”说，这种机器的发明“将在印刷史上打开新的一页”。
    新印刷机的发明人立陶宛共和国维尔纽斯师范学院的日列维奇教授在设计和试制这种印刷机中，利用了录音方法、传真术和电子计算机等现代电力工程的最新成就的原理。新的印刷机上装有传真发送机、示波器、磁带录音机和套在印刷机鼓轮上的磁性胶片。这种磁性胶片在磁带录音机中录音、定音和定影。传真发送机把稿纸上的字和图片的影样分解为连续的电脉冲，再用这种电脉冲来磁化磁性胶片，这样就能够在胶片上印出报纸或书籍的
  “磁性影样”，把整张报纸或整本书定影在胶片上。
    在印刷机的鼓轮转动的时候，套在上面的已经定了影的磁性胶片的磁场就穿透贴近它的纸张，把全部影样传送到纸上。和这同时，印刷机上的颜料喷雾器把一种细粉状的磁性颜料喷在转动的纸卷上，衬染在磁场穿过纸的那些地方，使字迹显现出来。随后，加热的滚筒轻轻滚过纸张，把颜料固着起来。这时候，一张张印好了的印刷品就从机器上出来了。
    日列维奇教授试制的新印刷机已经受到了苏联有关部门的重视。
