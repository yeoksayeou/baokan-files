    “Five-Guarantee Household” Becomes “Surplus Grain Household”
    Yuan Sande, a poor peasant from Xindian Village, Hanji Township, Xunyi County, Shaanxi Province, and his old wife are both over sixty years old. This April, after the transition to the advanced cooperative, because he was very old and had no support, the cooperative rated him as a "Five-Guarantee" household.
    Old man Yuan was very happy. However, he felt that he could still participate in some appropriate labor and was unwilling to just sit and wait for the cooperative to take care of him. When the cooperative was threshing wheat, he actively requested to participate. The cooperative cadres said, "You are so old, why are you still threshing wheat?" Old man Yuan said, "I can still work now, I can't just rely on the cooperative to support me."
    This summer, he worked one hundred and six workdays and actually received over one thousand four hundred catties of wheat. After deducting eight hundred and forty catties of grain for the two of them for the whole year, there was a surplus of over five hundred and sixty catties of grain. The "Five-Guarantee Household" became a "Surplus Grain Household." Yuan Xiaojie

    “五保户”变成“余粮户”
    陕西栒邑县韩家乡新店村贫农袁三得和他的老伴，都是六十开外的人了。今年四月间转高级社后，因为他年纪很大，又没有什么依靠，就被社里评为“五保”户。
    袁老汉很高兴。但他觉得自己还能参加一些适当的劳动，不愿意坐等社里照顾。社里赶麦场，他积极要求参加。社干部说：“你这么大年纪了，还赶啥麦场？”袁老汉说：“我现在还能劳动，不能光靠社里养活。”
    夏季他就做了一百零六个劳动日，实分到小麦一千四百多斤。除老俩口全年口粮八百四十斤外，还有余粮五百六十多斤。“五保户”变成了“余粮户”。　袁效杰
