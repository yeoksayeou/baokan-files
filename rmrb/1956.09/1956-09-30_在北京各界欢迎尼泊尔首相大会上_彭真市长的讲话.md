Mayor Peng Zhen's Speech at the Beijing People's Congress Welcoming the Nepalese Prime Minister

Respected Prime Minister Acharya and Madam, Ladies and Gentlemen:

Today, we, the people of Beijing, are here with great pleasure to welcome our distinguished guest, the Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Nepal, His Excellency Acharya, and Madam, as well as other Nepalese friends who have come with them. On behalf of all the people of Beijing, I express my heartfelt gratitude and warm welcome to you for your friendly visit, and I ask you to convey our deep friendship and warm greetings to the citizens of Kathmandu and all the people of Nepal.

Between China and Nepal lies the world's highest mountain, the Himalayas. But even in ancient times, this mountain could not sever the friendly exchanges between our two peoples. Nepal is the birthplace of Sakyamuni, the founder of Buddhism. To pay homage to the holy land of Buddhism, as early as the fifth century AD, our eminent monks Faxian and Xuanzang visited Lumbini Garden and other places in Nepal, braving hardships and traveling through mountains and rivers. From then on, there were constant messengers between China and Nepal, and frequent cultural exchanges began between our two countries. The mutual influence of our two countries in culture is profound and has a long history.

In the past century, due to the sabotage and obstruction of colonialists, the friendly exchanges between our two countries have been interrupted. However, the colonialists ultimately cannot sever the friendly relations between our two peoples. We have sympathized with and supported each other in our respective struggles for freedom and safeguarding. Both of our countries are supporters of the resolutions of the Asian-African Conference, and we are both determined to oppose colonialism. The people of both of our countries support Egypt's just action to nationalize the Suez Canal Company. We are not only close neighbors with traditional friendship, but our friendly relations have become even closer in the common struggle against colonialism.

We are very pleased to see that since the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Nepal and the determination to use the famous Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence as the basic principles guiding the relations between the two countries, the friendly relations between the two countries have been redeveloped on a new basis. On the eve of Your Excellency's visit to our country, the negotiations between the Chinese and Nepalese governments on various issues concerning the relations between China and Nepal have been successfully concluded. Our two countries have signed the "Agreement between the People's Republic of China and the Kingdom of Nepal on Maintaining Friendly Relations and on Trade and Intercourse between the Tibet Region of China and Nepal." The signing of this agreement provides favorable conditions for promoting friendship and understanding between the peoples of the two countries and developing economic and cultural ties between them. The Chinese people warmly welcome the signing of this agreement.

Your Excellency Prime Minister, we firmly believe that through your visit, the friendly relations between our two countries will be further consolidated and developed. We hope that you and your wife, as well as other friends who have come with you, will enjoy sightseeing in Beijing and other parts of our country and see all the situations you want to see. We hope that you can have a very pleasant time here, just like being in the home of an old friend who has been reunited after a long separation. I wish Your Excellency the Prime Minister and Madam and all friends good health!

I wish the Kingdom of Nepal prosperity and the people happiness!

I wish the friendly relations between China and Nepal will develop day by day!

Long live the unity and cooperation of the people of Asian and African countries!

Long live peace in Asia, Africa and the world!

    在北京各界欢迎尼泊尔首相大会上
    彭真市长的讲话尊敬的阿查里雅首相阁下和夫人，各位女士，各位先生：
    今天，我们北京市各界人民在这里以十分愉快的心情，欢迎我们的贵宾尼泊尔王国首相阿查里雅阁下和夫人以及同来的尼泊尔的其他朋友们。我代表北京市全体人民对你们友好的访问表示衷心的感谢和热烈的欢迎，并且请你们把我们的深厚友情和亲切问候带给加德满都的市民和尼泊尔全体人民。
    在我们中国同尼泊尔之间隔着一座世界上最高的山——喜马拉雅山。但是就是在遥远的古代，这座山也没有能够隔断我们两国人民之间的友好来往。尼泊尔是佛教的创始者释迦牟尼的降生地。为了瞻仰佛教的圣地，远在纪元后五世纪起，我国高僧法显和玄奘就先后不避艰险、跋山涉水访问了尼泊尔的论明园和其他地方，从那时起，中国同尼泊尔之间就有了不断的信使来往，开始了我们两国之间频繁的文化交流，我们两国之间在文化上的互相影响是很深而且有着悠久的历史的。
    近百年来，由于殖民主义者的破坏和阻挠，我们两国间的友好往来遭受了中断，但是，殖民主义者究竟是不能隔断我们两国人民间的友好关系的。在我们各自争取和维护自由的斗争中我们是相互同情和支持的。我们两国都是亚非会议的决议的支持者，我们都有反对殖民主义的决心。我们两国人民都支持埃及把苏伊士运河公司收归国有的正义行动。我们不仅是有传统友谊的近邻，而且在反对殖民主义的共同斗争中，我们的友好关系更加亲密了。
    我们十分高兴地看到，中尼两国自从建立外交关系并且确定以著名的和平共处五项原则作为指导两国关系的基本原则以来，两国的友好关系在新的基础上重新得到了发展。在首相阁下来我国的前夕，中尼两国政府间举行的关于中尼两国关系各项问题的谈判已经顺利结束。我们两国签订了“中华人民共和国和尼泊尔王国保持友好关系以及关于中国西藏地方和尼泊尔之间的通商和交通的协定”。这一协定的签订，对促进两国人民间的友谊和谅解，发展彼此间的经济和文化联系，提供了良好的条件。我们中国人民热烈欢迎这个协定的签订。
    首相阁下，我们深信不疑，通过你们的这次访问，我们两国的友好关系将会获得进一步的巩固和发展。我们希望你和你的夫人以及同来的其他朋友们能在北京和我国其他地方尽情地畅游参观，看你们所愿意看的各种情况，希望你们在我们这里能够过得十分愉快，像在一个久别重逢的老朋友家里一样，祝首相阁下和夫人及各位朋友们身体健康，
    祝尼泊尔王国繁荣、人民幸福！
    祝中尼友好关系日益发展！
    亚非各国人民团结合作万岁！
    亚非和世界和平万岁！
