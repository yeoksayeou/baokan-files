Xinhua News Agency, Dalian, August 8th. The Liaoning Provincial Salt Affairs Bureau recently successfully trial-produced a method for extracting potassium chloride from waste brine in salt fields and has begun large-scale production in many salt fields such as Jinzhou, Fuzhou Bay, Lushun, and Wudao. The potassium chloride extracted from these salt fields, after testing, all fully meet national technical standards.

Potassium chloride is an important raw material for the chemical industry, widely used in industry, and is also a very good agricultural fertilizer. In the past, the manufacture of potassium chloride was the responsibility of specialized factories. Starting in 1953, engineers from the Liaoning Provincial Salt Affairs Bureau began to study the utilization of waste brine. After more than two years, they finally succeeded in their research.

The method of extracting potassium chloride from waste brine has received attention from salt fields across the country. Recently, salt affairs bureaus from Huaibei, Liangguang, and three other regions have sent many factory directors and engineers to learn this new method.

    废卤水可提炼氯化钾
    新华社旅大8日电　辽宁省盐务局最近试制成功了从盐田里的废卤水中提炼氯化钾，并且开始在金州、复州湾、旅顺、伍岛等许多盐田进行大批生产。这些盐田提炼出来的氯化钾，经试验结果，都完全合乎国家的技术标准。
    氯化钾是重要化学工业原料，在工业上的用途很广，而且还是很好的农业肥料。过去制造氯化钾，都由专门的工厂担负。从1953年开始，辽宁省盐务局的工程师们就着手研究废卤水的利用问题。经过了两年多的时间，终于研究成功。
    从废卤中提炼氯化钾的办法，受到了全国各地盐场的重视。最近，淮北、两广等五个盐务局派去了许多厂长、工程师，学习这个新方法。
