    They Completed the Five-Year Plan Ahead of Schedule
    Taiyuan Mining Machinery Factory Implemented Its Initiative
    (Our Dispatch) The workers of the Taiyuan Mining Machinery Factory have already realized the initiative they proposed to the mechanical industry workers across the country. They reached the planned level for 1957 on August 25, completing the Five-Year Plan sixteen months ahead of schedule. The factory's total output value completed 100.77% of the plan, labor productivity completed 102.2%, and profits completed 107%. From 1953 to August of this year, the factory trial-produced and manufactured 54 types of major machine products, including coal cutters, drilling machines, and bulldozers, totaling 1,986 units. It provided various technical equipment to 329 industrial production units and industrial construction units distributed in 35 cities across 26 provinces, supporting socialist industrial construction.
    Since the beginning of this year, the advanced producer movement, with learning and promoting advanced experiences as its main content, has been continuously developing in depth within the factory. Through holding advanced producer schools, organizing the signing of technical assistance contracts, carrying out mass technical performances, mutual teaching and learning, and widely disseminating and promoting more than 50 major advanced experiences, the technical level of the workers has been greatly improved. Originally relatively backward workers, with the sincere and patient help of advanced producers, have caught up with the advanced, making the advanced producer ranks increasingly strong, and 949 advanced producers and 109 advanced workers have emerged. The in-depth development of the movement has also promoted the continuous improvement of production technology management. Currently, the workers of this factory have already started working on the 1958 plan.

    他们提前完成了五年计划
    太原矿山机器厂实现了自己的倡议
    本报讯　太原矿山机器厂的职工们已经实现了他们向全国机械工业职工提出的倡议，在8月25日达到1957年的计划水平，提前十六个月完成了五年计划。这个厂的生产总值完成了计划的100.77％，劳动生产率完成102.2％，利润完成107％。从1953年到今年8月，这个工厂试制和制造的主要机器产品有割煤机、钻探机、推土机等五十四种，共一千九百八十六台，为分布在二十六个省三十五个城市的三百二十九个工业生产单位和工业建设单位提供了各种技术装备，支援了社会主义工业建设。
    今年以来，以学习推广先进经验为主要内容的先进生产者运动在这个工厂不断深入发展，经过举办先进生产者学校，组织签订技术扶助合同，开展群众性的技术表演，互教互学，广泛地传布推广了五十多种主要的先进经验，大大地提高了职工的技术水平。原来比较落后的工人在先进生产者诚恳耐心的帮助下赶上了先进，使先进生产者队伍日益壮大，涌现出九百四十九名先进生产者和一百零九名先进工作者。运动的深入发展也促使生产技术管理工作不断得到改进，目前，这个工厂的工人已经开始作1958年的工作。
