In recent years, under the leadership and support of the Central Committee and local Party committees, the Ministry of Construction Engineering has formed a substantial construction force, completing and overfulfilling the construction and installation tasks assigned by the state, and improving the technical level of design and construction, thus preparing the ground for the larger industrial construction tasks of the Second Five-Year Plan.

Our implementation of the "good, fast, and economical" policy has not been comprehensive enough. We have focused more closely on project progress and construction speed, and many projects have been completed ahead of schedule; however, we have not paid enough attention to economy, resulting in significant waste; the quality of key projects is generally good, but the quality of some minor projects is poor, and there are still many quality accidents during construction. In implementing measures to reduce non-productive building standards, we have also made mistakes by overcorrecting, and some housing standards have been lowered too much, affecting quality and usability. We are working hard to correct these shortcomings from all aspects.

Now, I would like to offer some opinions on three issues: the planning and balancing of basic construction, the establishment of construction and installation organizations, and the contracting methods for construction projects.

I. On the Planning and Balancing of Basic Construction

The key to ensuring the smooth implementation of the state's basic construction plan lies in doing a good job of balancing. In the past, when formulating basic construction plans, we focused on the amount of investment, what factories to build, and when to complete them, while often paying insufficient attention to important aspects such as design, construction, and material and technical supply. Due to the lack of coordination between various aspects, poor衔接 between design and construction, and the untimely supply of equipment, construction has faced many difficulties. The most prominent problem this year is the shortage of building materials, especially steel. Not only is the quantity insufficient, but more seriously, the varieties, specifications, and supply times do not meet the needs of construction. Among the 70 key projects started by the Ministry of Construction Engineering in the first half of this year, 20 were in a state of suspension in June. In the end, we had to reduce this year's construction and installation plan. This serious disconnection is directly related to the冒进 tendency in arranging construction plans after our anti-conservatism campaign, and the fact that we had to deal with certain stockpiled materials every year also made us neglect the work of material balancing.

In construction projects, local materials such as bricks, tiles, lime, sand, and stone are needed in extremely large quantities. This year, the tasks of some large industrial construction areas have increased sharply, while the original production capacity could only supply 30% to 70%. At the beginning of the year, various provinces and cities proposed the issue of investing in building factories, but it has not been resolved. Therefore, construction units in places like Xi'an, Taiyuan, and Datong have gone to Shandong and Henan to buy large quantities of bricks and tiles. This not only increased transportation and handling costs, but also resulted in a high loss rate due to long-distance transportation and multiple loading and unloading operations. In some places, many unfinished houses were built, either lacking bricks to complete the walls or lacking tiles, which greatly damaged the quality of the projects and delayed the progress.

In order to establish the state's basic construction plan on a solid foundation, we believe that the balancing work of basic construction plans must be elevated to an important position. When determining construction projects, investment amounts, and construction and installation workload, the balancing work of all aspects of construction and installation must be carried out simultaneously. First is the balancing of building materials. According to material consumption quotas, the required amount of steel, cement, wood, and local materials should be planned, and decisions should be made on how to increase the construction of new factories or expand the production capacity of existing factories to ensure the needs of construction. Second, according to the level of industrialized construction and the needs of construction, various prefabricated processing plants should be established, and the planning of construction bases should be carried out, with the necessary investment allocated. Third, the balancing of construction machinery should be carried out. According to the level of mechanized construction stipulated by the state, the required amount of machinery should be planned. Since our country does not yet have a factory specializing in the manufacture of construction machinery, strengthening the balancing of machinery is even more important. Fourth, the balancing of labor force should be carried out. The source of labor force replenishment should be determined, new construction enterprises should be organized, and the replenishment of technical and administrative cadres should be organized, and technical schools and skilled worker schools should be established.

II. On the Establishment of Construction Organizations

China's industrial construction and installation force has developed separately since liberation. At present, in addition to the Ministry of Construction Engineering, which is a professional contracting ministry mainly responsible for the construction and some installation tasks of the First and Second Ministry of Machine Building and the Ministry of Light Industry, other central industrial departments almost all have their own construction and installation forces, adopting a self-managed or internal contracting method to undertake the construction tasks of their own departments. In the early stages of construction, when the construction force was relatively weak and lacked experience, it was necessary to adopt this method of separate development for construction organizations. However, with the expansion of the scale of national construction and the growth of the construction and installation force, the shortcomings of the existing organizational structure have gradually been exposed. For example, in Luoyang, on the one hand, the construction tasks of the Luoyang Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Construction Engineering, such as the tractor factory, are nearing completion, and many workers are idle, and most of the construction force will be transferred out; on the other hand, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry is preparing to transfer construction forces to undertake the construction of the non-ferrous metal processing plant; the Ministry of Electric Power is also transferring construction forces from the Northeast to build the Luoyang Thermal Power Plant. The Ministry of Textile Industry plans to build a textile factory in Luoyang and will transfer its construction force there. Around the spring of this year, three ministries of the central government transferred a total of three companies and brought in two companies within Heilongjiang Province alone. The transfer of a large company always involves tens of thousands of employees, plus family members, which is more than 20,000 people. Every time they arrive at a new construction area, they have to build a batch of affiliated enterprises and employee welfare facilities. In the same construction area, such affiliated enterprises and employee welfare facilities of construction organizations of various ministries are often established separately. This not only causes a lot of waste in manpower and materials, but also causes many difficulties for construction workers in their work and life, making it impossible to establish construction bases well, which is very unfavorable for cultivating construction workers and cadres, and improving technical level. At the same time, it also makes it inconvenient for local Party committees and governments to lead and supervise construction enterprises.

In order to improve the setting of construction organizations, we believe that: First, the setting of construction organizations should follow the principle of professional division of labor. At an appropriate time, professional contracting ministries should be added, and the construction forces belonging to various central industrial ministries should be appropriately merged, and construction tasks of similar nature should be uniformly assigned to a certain contracting ministry to contract. This can enable the various industrial ministries to concentrate on managing production, and also enable the contracting ministries to better accumulate experience and improve technology. Second, it should follow the principle of regional setting, and gradually uniformly assign tasks in the same construction area to one ministry to contract. In this way, it is possible to uniformly build construction bases, uniformly dispatch labor, materials and machinery, and the mobility and idle waste of construction organizations can be greatly reduced.

III. On the Contracting Method of Basic Construction

At present, the contracting method of basic construction is that after the state approves basic construction, both parties jointly determine the specific plan and arrange the progress. Party A (the construction unit) manages investment allocation, prepares special materials, and carries out technical supervision and acceptance. Party B (the construction unit) only contracts for labor and materials according to the annual plan. In order to carry out the above work, Party A uses many cadres and sets up many institutions corresponding to Party B within the preparatory construction organization. In Xi'an alone, the total number of cadres of various Party As responsible for this work is no less than 5,000, and some are even more than the number of cadres of the local Party B. These preparatory construction organizations, because they put too much energy into construction and technical supervision, affect their concentration on various production preparation work; moreover, both Party A and Party B feel that there is a lot of back and forth, and many problems cannot be solved in time, which is costly in terms of people and money, and also affects the smooth progress of construction. The project price of basic construction must be reviewed and visaed by Party A before it can be settled and allocated, which increases many forms and unnecessary procedures, and the time for reviewing vouchers is very long. In addition, during the construction process, the design is often changed, the amount of work increases and decreases frequently, and the procedures for project changes between Party A and Party B are incomplete and the records are incomplete, and the two parties often argue back and forth and cannot agree, which affects the project settlement. In the first quarter of this year, the projects of the Ministry of Construction Engineering that have been completed but cannot be settled accounted for 54% of the completed workload in the same period. In the first half of this year, there were 16 construction units in the Xi'an area that had been fully completed, delaying the time for acceptance and use. This makes the capital turnover of construction enterprises very difficult, affecting the smooth progress of construction, and also inevitably affects the timely delivery of completed projects for use. In terms of technical supervision, because the technical supervision personnel of Party A and Party B have different understandings of the quality acceptance standards, they often argue for a long time and cannot resolve the issue, sometimes even causing the interruption of construction. The alternative materials adopted by Party B in order to save costs and the new technologies promoted, although they have been proven by scientific experiments or expert appraisal, Party A is still afraid of affecting the quality of the project and does not allow them to be used. Often, because Party A and Party B have inconsistent understandings, the promotion of new technologies is affected.

This contracting method, in the past when Party B lacked construction management experience and technical strength was also insufficient, played a great role in ensuring construction progress and project quality. However, with the development of work, the back and forth between Party A and Party B has become more and more frequent, and both parties feel passive in their work. Practice has proved that this contracting method is detrimental to the current basic construction work and both Party A and Party B, and needs to be appropriately changed. We believe that in the future, in addition to being responsible for selecting factory sites, entrusting design, ordering production equipment, and reviewing design budgets, Party A can allocate all the investment in construction and installation projects in the basic construction plan to Party B, and Party B will be responsible for completing the construction and installation tasks in a comprehensive manner with good quality and quantity, and deliver the entire factory according to the progress. Under the principle of not affecting the overall progress of factory construction and not delaying the date of putting the workshops into production one after another, Party B can reasonably adjust and balance the monthly and quarterly construction plans according to the specific conditions of construction. Technical supervision work should also be handed over to Party B to establish an independent supervision institution to be responsible for implementation, and the supervision and acceptance of concealed projects should still be the responsibility of Party A. Or Party A can send people to participate in the supervision institution of Party B, which is also acceptable. After changing the contracting method in this way, the back and forth relationship between Party A and Party B and many unnecessary procedures can be greatly reduced, the number of on-site personnel of Party A can be greatly reduced, and they can concentrate on production preparation work; at the same time, it can also give full play to the initiative of Party B. We hope that this method can be implemented as soon as possible.

    当前基本建设中的三个问题
    建筑工程部部长　刘秀峰同志的发言
    几年来，建筑工程部在中央和各地党委的领导和支持下，组成了一支相当大的建筑力量，完成和超额完成了国家交付的建筑安装任务，提高了设计和施工的技术水平，为完成第二个五年计划更大的工业建筑任务准备了条件。
    我们在执行“好、快、省”方针上是不够全面的，对于工程进度抓得较紧，施工速度比较快，许多工程都提前竣工了；但是，对于节约却注意得不够，浪费很大；重点工程的质量一般是好的，但有些次要工程的质量较差，施工中的质量事故还是很多。在执行降低非生产性建筑标准的措施中，我们也曾经发生过矫枉过正的偏差，有些房屋标准降得过低，影响质量和适用。这些缺点，我们正在从各方面努力纠正。
    现在，我仅就基本建设的计划平衡工作、建筑安装机构的设置和建筑工程承包方式等三个问题发表一些意见。
    一、关于基本建设的计划平衡问题
    保证国家基本建设计划顺利执行的关键，在于做好平衡工作。过去在编制基本建设计划时，偏重于考虑投资多少，建设什么工厂，什么时间建成，而对于设计、施工和物资技术供应等重要环节，则往往注意不够。由于各个环节的不协调，设计与施工衔接的不好，设备有时供应不及，曾给施工方面带来很多的困难。今年最突出的问题，是建筑材料供应不足，尤其是钢材缺乏，不但是数量不够，更严重的是品种、规格和供应时间不符合施工的需要。今年上半年建筑工程部开工的七十项重点工程中，在六月间曾有二十项陷于停工状态。最后，不得不把今年的建筑安装计划削减。这种严重的脱节现象，和我们反保守以后，在安排施工计划时又产生的冒进倾向有直接关系，而过去每年都要处理某些积压材料，也使我们忽略了物资平衡工作。
    在建筑工程中，砖、瓦、灰、砂、石等地方材料，需要数量极大。今年一些大的工业建设地区，任务突增，而原来的生产能力只能供应百分之三十到百分之七十。年初各省市就提出投资建厂问题，但一直没有得到解决。因此，像西安、太原、大同等地的施工单位，就曾经到山东、河南大量买砖、买瓦。这不仅多花了运输、装卸费用，而且由于远距离运输和几次装卸倒运，损耗率也很大。有些地方还盖了不少的半截房子，不是少砖，墙砌不上去，就是少瓦，房子老张着口，大大损害了工程质量，拖迟了工程进度。
    为了把国家基本建设计划建立在稳妥的基础上，我们认为，必须把基本建设计划的平衡工作，提高到重要的地位上来。在确定建设项目、投资额和建筑安装工作量时，必须同时进行建筑安装工作各个方面的平衡工作。首先是建筑材料的平衡。根据材料消耗定额，计划钢材、水泥、木材和地方材料的需要量，并且决定如何增建新厂，或扩大现有工厂的生产能力，以保证施工的需要。第二，根据工厂化施工水平和施工的需要，建立各种预制加工厂，进行建筑基地的规划；拨给必要的投资。第三，进行建筑机械的平衡。根据国家规定的机械化施工水平，计划机械的需要量。现在我国还没有一个专门制造建筑机械的工厂，加强机械的平衡工作，更有重要的意义。第四，是进行劳动力的平衡。确定劳动力的补充来源，组织新的建筑企业，组织技术干部和行政干部的补充工作，开办技术学校和技工学校。
    二、关于建筑机构的设置问题
    我国的工业建筑安装力量是在解放后分头发展起来的。目前，除了建筑工程部是专业的承包部，主要担负第一、二机械工业部、轻工业部的建筑和部分安装任务而外，中央其他各工业部门几乎都还有自己的建筑安装力量，采取自营或内包的方式，担负本部门的施工任务。在建设初期，施工力量比较薄弱、经验又很缺乏的情况下，建筑组织采取这样分头发展的办法是必要的。但是，随着国家建设规模的扩大，建筑安装力量的成长，已逐渐暴露出来现有建筑组织的设置情况是有缺点的，如在洛阳，现在一方面是建筑工程部洛阳工程局担负的拖拉机厂等工程的建筑任务接近完成，已有不少工人在窝工，大部施工力量将要外调；而另一方面，冶金工业部正在准备调去施工力量，承担有色金属加工厂的建厂工程；电力工业部为了承建洛阳热电站，也从东北调去施工力量。纺织工业部计划在洛阳建设纺织厂，又将调去其施工力量。今年春天前后，中央三个部在黑龙江一省内就共调出三个公司，调进两个公司。调动一个大型的公司，总有上万职工，加上家属就有二万人以上。每到一个新的施工地区，就得兴建一批附属企业和职工生活福利设施。而在同一建设地区，各部施工组织的这类附属企业和职工生活福利设施往往也是各搞一套。这样，不仅造成人力物力上许多浪费，而且使建筑职工在工作和生活上遭受很多困难，使建筑基地不能很好建立，对于培养生长建筑工人和干部，提高技术水平，都是很不利的。同时，也使地方党委和政府对建筑企业的领导和监督感到不便。
    为了改善建筑组织的设置情况，我们认为：建筑组织的设置，第一、应当按照专业分工的原则，在适当时机，增设专业的承包部，把分属于中央各工业部的施工力量进行适当的归并，把性质相近的施工任务统一划归一定的承包部来承包。这样，既能使各工业部集中力量管理生产，又能使承包部更好的积累经验，提高技术。第二、应当按照区域设置的原则，将同一个建设地区的任务逐渐统一划归一个部来承包。这样，就可以统一的建设建筑基地，统一调度劳动力、材料和机械，建筑组织的流动性和窝工浪费现象也就可以大大减少。
    三、关于基本建设的承包方式问题
    现在，基本建设的承包方式，是当国家批准基本建设后，由甲乙双方共同确定具体计划，安排进度，甲方（建设单位）管理投资拨款，准备特殊材料，进行技术监督和验收，乙方（施工单位）只是按年度计划包工包料。甲方为了进行上述工作，用了很多干部，在筹建机构内设置了很多和乙方相应的管理施工的机构，仅在西安一地，各甲方担负这种工作的干部，总算起来即不下五千人，有的比当地乙方的干部数目还要多些。这些筹建机构，由于过多的把精力放在施工和技术监督方面，影响他们集中精力进行各项生产准备工作；而且甲乙双方都感到扯皮很多，许多问题不能及时解决，既费人、费钱，也影响施工的顺利进行。基本建设的工程价款，因为必需经过甲方审查签证，才能结算拨款，增加了很多表报和不必要的手续，审查凭证的时间拖得很长。加上在施工过程中，设计常有改变，工程量增减频繁，甲乙双方对工程更改的手续又不完备，记录不全，双方往往扯来扯去，争执不下，影响工程结算。今年第一季度，建筑工程部已经完工而不能结算的工程，即占同期完成工作量的百分之五十四。西安地区今年上半年就有十六个已经全部竣工的建设单位，拖延了验收使用时间。这样就使建筑企业的资金周转发生很大困难，影响施工的顺利进行，而且还必然影响到竣工工程的及时交付使用。在技术监督方面，由于甲乙双方的技术监督人员对于质量验收标准的认识不一，也往往争执很久，不能解决，有时甚至还造成施工的中断。乙方为了节约所采用的代用材料和推广的新技术等措施，虽然已经过科学实验证明，或专家鉴定，甲方还是恐怕影响工程质量，不准采用。常常因为甲乙双方认识不一致，影响了新技术的推广。
    这种承包方式，在过去乙方缺乏施工管理经验，而且技术力量也很不足的时期，曾经对于保证建设进度和工程质量起了很大作用。但是，随着工作的发展，甲乙双方的扯皮现象越来越多，双方都感到工作被动。实践证明，这种承包方式，对于目前基本建设工作和甲乙双方都是不利的，需要适当地加以改变。我们认为，今后甲方除了负责选择厂址、委托设计、订购生产设备、审核设计预算以外，可以把基本建设计划中所有属于建筑安装工程的投资，全部划归乙方，由乙方负责如质如量全面的完成建筑安装任务，按进度交出整个工厂。在不影响建厂总进度，不推迟车间先后投入生产的日期的原则下，乙方可以按照施工的具体条件，合理地调整和平衡月季施工计划。技术监督工作也应该交给乙方建立独立的监督机构负责执行，隐蔽工程的监督和验收仍由甲方负责。或甲方派人参加乙方的监督机构，亦无不可。这样改变承包方式以后，就可以大大减少甲乙双方的扯皮关系和很多不必要的手续，使甲方在现场的机构人员大为减少，能够集中精力进行生产准备工作；同时，也能够充分发挥乙方工作的主动性。这个办法希望能够及早试行。
