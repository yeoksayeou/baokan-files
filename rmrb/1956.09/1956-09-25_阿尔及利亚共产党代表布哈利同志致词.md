Dear Comrades,

The Central Committee of the Algerian Communist Party is deeply moved by the invitation to participate in the Eighth Congress of your great Party. In the current situation in Algeria, our Central Committee sees this invitation not only as an act of proletarian internationalism, but also as an expression of the solidarity and friendship of the Chinese people towards the Algerian people who are fighting for national independence and peace. Therefore, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to you.

Our Party Central Committee extends to you warm and most intimate brotherly greetings, and believes that this also expresses the deep friendship of the Algerian Communists and workers. The Central Committee wishes you complete success in your work for the happiness of the Chinese people and the consolidation of peace among the peoples of all countries.

The Algerian people have watched the heroic struggle of the Chinese people with excitement and have cheered for its historic victory. The Algerians know very well that it is because of relying on the Chinese Communist Party and the prestigious Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong that the Chinese people were able to unite around the working class and the peasantry, and were able to end the slavery of colonialism and feudalism. Today, the Chinese people are enthusiastically engaged in the peaceful construction of a new life and a socialist society, and the initial achievements of this construction will frighten the imperialists and cheer the peoples of all countries.

Following the Great October Socialist Revolution, the liberation of the Chinese people marked a new stage of decisive significance in eliminating the imperialist colonial system. Since then, other peoples in Asia and Africa have also broken their shackles and gained national independence. From now on, no one can prevent the victory of the peoples of all countries, including the Algerian people, who are fighting for national liberation.

Inspired by the experience of the liberated countries, especially the Chinese people, the Algerian people have been waging a decisive struggle against French colonialism, which has ruled us for 126 years, for nearly two years. At that time, the colonialists tried their best to publicize their argument that "Algeria is France." Today, although they still insist that the Algerian issue is purely a French affair, they no longer dare to cling to this self-defeating lie. Fearing the discontent of the French people and world opinion, especially with the United Nations General Assembly about to convene, the colonial rulers are trying to convince people that their so-called "appeasement" policy is successful, and that Algeria will soon achieve a new political status. There is nothing more hypocritical than this statement.

On November 1, 1954, there were less than 50,000 French soldiers stationed in Algeria, but now there are more than 500,000. Lagoste [Note: French Minister-Delegate in Algeria] still doesn't think it's enough. This is clear evidence of the bankruptcy of the policy of force pursued by the leaders of the French Socialist Party for the benefit of their colonialist bourgeoisie.

Guerrilla activities against the colonial army have never been as frequent and lethal as in the past three months. This is because the National Liberation Army has greatly strengthened in combat. Almost all the Algerian people support this army in various forms. Although in the early stages of the struggle, only Communists or a few advanced elements among the Europeans in Algeria participated in or supported this struggle, now those workers who have been deceived by the colonialists have begun to awaken. They are beginning to understand that their interests and future in Algeria depend on a peaceful solution to the Algerian issue and not on the continuation of the colonial war.

The French government should bear full responsibility for this war, which violates the interests of the Algerian and French people. The key to the problem is whether the French government can contact the representatives of the Algerian "Resistance Movement" in order to implement a ceasefire and conduct negotiations, so as to seek a solution to the Algerian issue that respects the national aspirations of the Algerian people and maintains the legitimate interests of France. As long as the French government ignores the leaders of the "Resistance Movement," there can be no question of restoring peace in Algeria, because our people already fully understand the value of the colonialists' promises and political status. Regardless of the attitude of the French government, the Algerian people have no doubt about the victory of their just cause. This is primarily because it has made an unprecedented determination to continue the fight at all costs, and in this fight, it strengthens internal unity day by day; secondly, because it believes that the French working class, led by the great French Communist Party, stands with it. The interests of the French working class have nothing in common with those of the wealthy colonialists who oppress us and today are increasingly attempting to carry out aggression against the Egyptian people; finally, because: the Algerian people know that their just cause is supported not only by the Arab peoples but also by all the peace and democratic forces of the world, headed by the Soviet Union and People's China. As for the Algerian Communist Party, it is striving to stand at the forefront of our people's struggle. The work of your Eighth Party Congress, like the Twentieth Congress of the great Communist Party of the Soviet Union, will become a treasure trove for it to draw lessons from in improving its work and correctly resolving current problems. You have skillfully applied Marxism-Leninism to solve the problems of past national liberation wars and today's socialist construction based on China's actual conditions, thereby enriching this science. The problems you have encountered in the past are the problems we are encountering now and will certainly encounter in the future. Therefore, your rich experience will be a great help to us, and we will try our best to make full use of it.

Long live the friendship and peace between the peoples of all countries!
Long live the great Chinese Communist Party!
Long live the glorious banner of proletarian internationalism!

### 阿尔及利亚共产党代表布哈利同志致词

    阿尔及利亚共产党代表布哈利同志致词亲爱的同志们：
    阿尔及利亚共产党中央委员会对被邀请参加你们伟大的党的第八次代表大会深为感动。在目前阿尔及利亚所处的境况下，我们中央委员会不仅把这种邀请看作是无产阶级国际主义的行动，而且把它看作是中国人民对于为争取民族独立与和平而斗争的阿尔及利亚人民的团结友爱的表现。因此，我谨向你们表示深切的感谢。
    我们党中央委员会谨向你们致以热烈的和最亲密的兄弟般的敬礼，并相信这也表达了阿尔及利亚共产党人和劳动者的深厚的情谊。中央委员会谨祝你们为谋取中国人民的幸福与巩固各国人民之间的和平而进行的工作获得圆满的成功。
    阿尔及利亚人民曾经怀着激动的心情注视中国人民的英勇斗争，并且为它的历史性胜利而欢呼。阿尔及利亚人很知道，正是由于依靠中国共产党和以毛泽东同志为首的富有威望的中央委员会，中国人民才得以在工人阶级和农民阶级的周围团结起来，才得以结束殖民主义和封建主义的奴役。今天，中国人民正在热情地从事于新生活和社会主义社会的和平建设，这一建设的初步成就将使得帝国主义者惊惶失措，和使各国人民欢欣鼓舞。
    在伟大的十月社会主义革命以后，中国人民的解放标志着消灭帝国主义殖民体系的一个有决定意义的新的阶段。从此亚非两洲其他的人民也打破枷锁，获得了民族独立。从今以后，没有任何人能够阻止为民族解放而斗争的包括阿尔及利亚人民在内的各国人民取得胜利。
    在获得解放了的各国人民，首先是中国人民的经验的启示下，阿尔及利亚人民已经进行了将近两年的反对统治我们已一百二十六年的法国殖民主义的具有决定性的斗争。当时，殖民主义者竭力大肆宣传其“阿尔及利亚就是法国”的论调。今天，尽管他们还是硬说阿尔及利亚问题是纯粹法国的事情，但他们已不再敢死命抱住这种不攻自破的谎言了。由于害怕引起法国人民群众和世界舆论的不满，特别是联合国大会召开在即，殖民统治者试图使人们相信他们奉行的所谓“绥靖”政策是成功的，以及阿尔及利亚不久就将取得新的政治地位。没有比这种说法再虚伪的了。
    一九五四年十一月一日驻在阿尔及利亚的法国士兵还不到五万人，而现在竟达五十万人以上。拉戈斯特（注：法国驻阿尔及利亚部长级总督）却还觉得不够。这就是法国社会党领导人为了他们的殖民主义的资产阶级的利益，而执行的武力政策破产的明证。
    抗击殖民军的游击活动从来没有像过去三个月那样的频繁和具有杀伤力。这是因为民族解放军在战斗中大大地加强了。几乎全部阿尔及利亚人民都在各种不同的形式下支持着这支军队。虽然在战斗的初期，在阿尔及利亚的欧洲人，仅有共产党人或少数先进分子参加或支持这一战斗，但是现在那些受殖民主义者欺骗过的劳动者却已经开始觉悟了。他们开始懂得自己在阿尔及利亚的利益和前途取决于阿尔及利亚问题的和平解决而不在于继续进行殖民战争。
    应该由法国政府对这次违反阿尔及利亚人民和法国人民利益所进行的战争负全部责任。问题的关键在于法国政府能否与阿尔及利亚“抵抗运动”的代表们进行接触，以便实行停火和进行谈判，从而寻求一个既能尊重阿尔及利亚人民的民族愿望，又能保持法国的合法利益的解决阿尔及利亚问题的办法。只要法国政府漠视“抵抗运动”的领导者，那就谈不上在阿尔及利亚恢复和平的问题，因为我国人民已经十分懂得殖民主义者的诺言和政治地位的价值了。不管法国政府的态度如何，阿尔及利亚人民对自己正义事业的胜利是丝毫没有怀疑的。这首先是因为他自己已下定前所未有的决心，不惜一切牺牲继续进行战斗，并且在这种战斗中，日甚一日地加强内部的团结；其次是因为它相信在伟大的法国共产党所领导的法国工人阶级是和它站在一起的。法国工人阶级的利益与那些富豪的殖民主义者的利益毫无共同之点，这些富豪的殖民主义者压迫着我们，而今天又变本加厉地企图对埃及人民实行侵略；最后，是因为：阿尔及利亚人民知道他们的正义事业不仅有各阿拉伯人民而且还有以苏联和人民中国为首的全世界的一切和平民主力量的支持。至于阿尔及利亚的共产党，它正努力使自己站在我国人民斗争的最前列。你们第八次党代表大会的工作正如同伟大的苏联共产党第二十次代表大会一样，将成为它吸取改进工作和正确地解决当前问题的经验教训的宝库。你们根据中国的实际情况熟练地运用马克思列宁主义以解决以往的民族解放战争问题和今天的社会主义建设问题，并从而丰富了这门科学。过去你们所遇到过的问题就是我们现在所遇到和将来一定还要遇到的问题。因此，你们的丰富经验对我们将是一个巨大的帮助，我们将要尽力加以充分地利用。
    各国人民之间的友谊与和平万岁！
    伟大的中国共产党万岁！
    无产阶级国际主义的光荣的旗帜万岁！
