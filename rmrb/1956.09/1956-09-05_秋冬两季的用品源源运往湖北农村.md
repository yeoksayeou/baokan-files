Xinhua News Agency Report: In response to the changes in farmers' demand for industrial products after agricultural collectivization, state-owned commercial departments in Hubei Province have increased both the quantity and variety of autumn and winter supplies for rural areas in the third quarter. Currently, autumn and winter supplies are steadily being shipped to rural areas.

Many commodities that were not supplied in the past, or were supplied in small quantities, will be supplied in larger quantities this year. For example, many rural women have changed their habit of spinning cotton yarn themselves because they are participating in agricultural activities, so department stores will supply more than 100,000 bundles of wooden yarn to rural areas this year. As a result of the literacy campaign and the establishment of financial systems in agricultural cooperatives, there is a need for many cultural and educational supplies, so the supply of abacuses, fountain pens, and various small stationery items has greatly increased.

The person in charge of the Hubei Provincial Department of Commerce believes that Hubei Province has achieved a bumper harvest of rice and cotton this year, and it is estimated that farmers' purchasing power will increase by about one-third compared with last year. Relevant state-owned specialized companies are now working hard to increase the supply of commodities from various sources. Rural news.

    秋冬两季的用品源源运往湖北农村
    据新华社讯　根据农业合作化后农民对工业品需要状况的变化，湖北省国营商业部门第三季度供应农村的秋冬令用品的数量和品种都有增加。目前，秋冬令用品正源源运往农村。
    许多往年没有供应或者很少供应的商品将较大量地供应。例如许多农村妇女因为参加农事活动而改变了自己纺制棉纱线的习惯，百货公司今年便供应农村十多万打木纱团。农村中开展扫盲工作和农业社建立财务制度的结果，需要很多文化用品，因此算盘、钢笔和各种小文具的供应量便大有增加。
    湖北省商业厅负责人认为：今年湖北省稻谷、棉花获得丰收，估计农民购买力要比去年提高三分之一左右。现在有关国营专业公司正在努力从多方面来增加商品供应量。农村新事
