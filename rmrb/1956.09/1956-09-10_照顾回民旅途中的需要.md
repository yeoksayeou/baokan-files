    Caring for the Needs of Hui People During Travel
    I am a Hui student. This vacation, I traveled from Beijing to Shanghai, and I found it very inconvenient in terms of food during the trip. Although the train has a very comfortable dining car, we Hui people cannot eat there; and there are very few things that Hui people can eat along the way at various stations. As far as I know, similar situations exist on other routes and in other passenger transport departments. I don't think this is a trivial matter. Every day, some Hui people travel by train and ship, and if their dietary needs are not addressed, the impact will be negative. Therefore, I suggest that relevant departments quickly find a way to prepare some halal pastries and other foods for Hui passengers. Mu Zhongquan

    照顾回民旅途中的需要
    我是回族学生。这次假期，从北京到上海，旅途中在饮食方面感到很不方便。虽然列车中设有非常舒服的食堂，但是我们回民不能去吃饭；沿路各站也很少有回民能食用的东西。据我所知，在其他线路和其他客运部门也有类似情况。我认为，这并不是一件小事情。每天各地都有一些回民乘坐火车、轮船，他们的饮食问题不注意解决，影响是不好的。因此，我建议有关部门，迅速设法为回民旅客准备一些清真糕点等食品。　穆中权
