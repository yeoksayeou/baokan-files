Title: Black Bear

　　I had heard long ago that the Beijing Zoo had acquired a batch of precious animals. Seeing rare birds and strange animals would naturally broaden one's horizons and add to one's knowledge; but I wandered around and actually stopped at the black bear exhibit. This wasn't because I had a preconceived bias, favoring the black bear over all the other animals. It was truly because it was connected to my childhood memories.

　　Black bears are called "black blind men" in my hometown. When I was little, if I didn't want to go to sleep at night, my grandmother would often scare me by saying "the black blind man is coming." At first, I felt chills and quickly hid my head under the covers, holding my breath and slowly falling asleep. But I still wasn't completely convinced, because she kept saying "coming, coming," but I never actually saw it come even once. Of course, I never saw it come.

　　According to my grandmother, whenever the green curtain of crops rose and the corn began to kernel, the black bear would run down from the mountain. But my grandmother also said that they didn't come sneaking; they came swaggering, walking with a "pat-pat" sound. Sometimes, they even wore a little red jacket, looking quite strange. When they came to the field, they would eat melons if they found them, and sometimes they would use their paws to dig up potatoes; but more often, they would break corn along the ridges. They would break off an ear and tuck it under their arm, then break off another and tuck it under, but the first ear would fall down again. They would break off many, but in the end, they would only have one ear, but they insisted on breaking off every single one. Whenever I heard this, we would often laugh, laughing at how silly and funny it was. My grandmother would say seriously, "Don't laugh, it runs away hurriedly when people come, and it comes back when people leave. It's just that shameless!" "What if people want to hit it?" we would ask. My grandmother said, "That's a gentleman's way of fighting, hitting and resting, resting and hitting. If people rest, it doesn't rest, and goes to pull up small trees and sweep the yard; if people are losing, it presses them to the ground and licks their faces, sometimes even licking off their noses!" Only then did I understand that my grandmother often scolded people with the phrase "did the bear lick your face?", which originated from this anecdote!

　　My grandmother told these stories to scare us, but the impression we got was just the opposite. We didn't find the bear scary, but rather cute. If I were to use Beijing slang, it was really "hilarious." We always thought it was simple, honest, and without malice, and we even envied it!

　　This time when I saw the black bear, it wasn't much different from my childhood imagination, even though it was locked in a cage. Several of them, ignoring the whims of the onlookers, some were lying on the ground sleeping; some who weren't sleeping were using their front paws to poke the ears of their sleeping companions; the ones who woke up slapped them hard, then they ran over, clung to the bars, and stared blankly outwards, sometimes climbing to a high place and falling down without caring; sometimes, they would start fighting. As a result, the onlookers applauded, but not very enthusiastically: "Look how stupid!" "Doesn't even know how to worry!" "Worry about what, has food and drink…" I couldn't say anything about these different opinions. But one thing I understood was that they嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌them for being too stupid and too simple, showing a kind of disdain. But before people's resentment for this stupidity and simplicity had subsided, the two bears lay down and went to sleep again. No matter how much they called out, they wouldn't get up, and even if they tried to tempt them with biscuits and cherries, they wouldn't pay attention. The onlookers, in order to get their own satisfaction, even though they had spent money, finally failed. So some angrily said, "Nothing to see, so stupid and silly…" and turned away.

　　But I saw that the black bear still didn't even raise its eyelids. I was worried for it, but I also pondered its psychology, probably thinking at the moment: if you throw something in, I'll eat it if I'm hungry, and if I'm not hungry, I don't need to pay attention to you. I never worried about food and drink when I was outside the cage, and I didn't rely on flattering to get food and drink. As for jumping around, that's when I feel like it, but it's definitely not deliberately acting innocent to please you.

　　Being silly and stupid is indeed its shortcomings. When onlookers want it to wink, it just doesn't wink, bringing trouble on itself, which is proof of its silliness and stupidity. But there are stupid ones, and there are relatively clever ones. In the past, bear trainers were often seen on the streets, raising a whip to do a "Su Qin carrying a sword" pose, and striking a gong to do a "Erlang carrying a mountain" pose; onlookers not only liked it, but also threw a few copper coins. Although the bear earned a few bites of steamed buns, it was already thin and emaciated, with only a skeleton left. It can be seen that this job is indeed not easy. It is said that the methods used by bear trainers to control bears are, first, starvation, and second, breaking their teeth; this clearly proves that the bear had resisted, and it also shows that people have put in a lot of effort to give the bear extra cleverness.

　　But I think that this extra cleverness, added to its body, is really its misfortune. I hope that people will no longer add extra cleverness to bears or anything else; I also hope that bears and anything else will no longer learn that set of extra cleverness; the fewer such things, the better, having it is not as good as not having it.

    黑熊
    焦勇夫
    早就听说北京动物园来了一批珍贵的动物。看看奇禽异兽，自是开拓眼界，略助见闻；而我踱来踱去竟在黑熊那里站住了脚，这倒不是先就有了厚此薄彼的成见，在众多的动物之中，偏偏看上了黑熊，这确是因为它和我的童年的记忆联缀在一块儿了。
    黑熊，在我们家乡叫“黑瞎子”。小时候，晚上不愿入睡，老祖母就常常拿“黑瞎子来了”的话吓唬我。起初，还觉得毛骨悚然，忙把头缩进被子里，屏住气儿，慢慢地睡过去。但毕竟还不是那么心悦诚服，那原因就在老是“来了，来了”地讲，却终不见来过一次的缘故。当然来还是没见它来的。
    据老祖母说，每当青纱帐起，玉米结粒的时节，黑熊便从山上跑下来。但老祖母又说，人家可不是偷着来的，大摇大摆，走起路来，啪嗒啪嗒的；有时候，身上还披个小红夹袄呢，怪里怪气的。来到地里，遇到瓜就吃瓜，有时候还用掌去扒土豆；但更多的时候是顺着垅掰玉米。掰一穗挟到胳肢窝里，再掰一穗再一挟，可是前一穗又落了下来。掰了许多，最后还只是一穗，可是它又非掰到头不可。每听到这，我们常常发笑，笑它是那么憨，那么有趣。老祖母认真地说：“不要笑，人一来它就颠颠地跑掉，人走了它还回来，就是那么没脸没皮！”“假如人要打它呢？”我们问。老祖母说：“那也是君子打法的，说打就打，打打歇歇，歇歇打打。人歇了，它不歇，又去拔小树，打扫场子；人要败了，它就按倒地下，用舌头舔脸皮，有时候连鼻子都舔没了！”这我一下才明白，老祖母每每骂人“你的脸让熊瞎子舔了？”的话，原来还是出于这个典故！
    老祖母讲这些，原是叫我们害怕，但给我们的印象却恰恰相反。并不觉得熊的可怕，反而觉得它可爱，假如用北京话说，它可是“真逗”了。我们总以为它憨直，忠厚，没有什么机心，倒也还很羡慕它呢！
    这次我见到的黑熊，和我儿时的想象，好像也没什么两样，虽然它被关在樊笼里。它们几个，竟不顾看客们的兴之所欲，有的倒在地上睡着了；有的不睡就用前爪去拨弄睡着的同伴的耳朵；睡了的醒来使劲打了一巴掌，它又跑过来，攀住栏杆，向外傻望，有时也爬上高处，摔下来满不在乎；有时候，又厮打起来。于是，看客中发出了喝采声，但不怎么热烈：“看笨的！”“还不知道愁呢！”“愁什么，有吃有喝……”对这不同的议论，我说不出什么。但有一点，我明白，就是嫌它们太笨，太憨直，显出一种鄙薄的神情。但人们为了这笨和憨直的气还未消，那两个熊竟又躺下睡了。再怎么呼叫，也不起来，甚至使出利诱，扔进饼干、樱桃，它也不再理一下。看客们为了得到自己的满足，虽则花了血本，也终于落空了。于是有的愤然说道：“没看头，又笨又傻……”转身走了。
    但我看那黑熊仍然是连眼皮也没抬，我为它着急，但又揣度了一下它的心理，大概此刻它们在想：扔进东西来，饿了我就吃，不饿我就用不着理你，当年在笼子外也没愁过吃喝，也不是靠献媚态来混吃喝。至于跳跳，那是兴之所至，可绝不是故作天真，来讨你们的喜欢。
    傻和笨，也委实是它的缺点。看客要它挤眉弄眼的时候，它偏偏不挤眉弄眼，自讨苦吃，便是傻和笨的证据。但有笨的，也有比较伶俐的。过去在街头巷尾常见耍熊的，鞭子一举来一手“苏秦背剑”，镗锣一敲又来一个“二郎担山”；看客们不但喜欢，而且还扔几个铜板。那熊虽然赚来了几口饽饽吃，可已经瘦弱伶仃，只剩下骨架了。可见，这碗饭的确也不容易吃。据说，耍熊的人，控制熊的办法，第一是饿，第二是冲掉牙；这就分明证明着熊有过反抗，也说明人为了赋与熊的多余的伶俐，也是费过一番手脚的。
    但我以为，这多余的伶俐，加在它的身上，也实在是它的不幸。我希望：人不要再加给熊或其他什么身上以多余的伶俐；我也希望熊以及其他什么再也不要学那套多余的伶俐；这样的东西越少越好，有，总不如没有好。
