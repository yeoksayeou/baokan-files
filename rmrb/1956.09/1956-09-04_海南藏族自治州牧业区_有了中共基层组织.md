Xinhua News Agency, 3rd - Since the latter half of last year, four pastoral counties in the Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Qinghai Province have established Communist Party grassroots organizations among the minority nationality laboring herdsmen. Two hundred and fifty-four male and female laboring herdsmen have been admitted into the Party, and Party branches have been established in most districts.

These Communist Party members, who are from laboring herdsman backgrounds, are all activists in implementing the Party's various policies and uniting people from all walks of life to develop animal husbandry production. Ge Ming, a branch secretary in the Aquhu District of Xinghai County, had a high reputation among the masses before joining the Party. At the beginning of this year, he piloted a pastoral cooperative in the neighboring area of the Aquhu District. Now, eight more herdsmen households have requested Ge Ming to lead them in organizing mutual aid teams to create conditions for establishing a cooperative.

    海南藏族自治州牧业区
    有了中共基层组织
    据新华社3日讯　青海省海南藏族自治州的四个牧业县，从去年下半年开始在少数民族劳动牧民群众中建立共产党的基层组织以来，已有二百五十四名男女劳动牧民被接收入党，并且在大部分的区先后建立了党的支部。
    这批劳动牧民出身的共产党员，都是在贯彻执行党的各项政策和团结各阶层人民发展畜牧业生产中的积极分子。兴海县阿曲乎区一个名叫格明的支部书记，入党前就在群众中有很高威信。今年年初，他在阿曲乎区的邻近地区试办了一个牧业社。现在，又有八户牧民要求格明领导他们组织互助组，为建社创造条件。
