    The Westernmost Section of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway
    From Tuotuo, west of Usu in Xinjiang, stretching northwest along the edge of Lake Ebinur to Alataw Pass on the Sino-Soviet border, there is a distance of over 119 kilometers. This is the westernmost section within our country of the international railway trunk line connecting Lanzhou, Urumqi, and Aktogay, a crucial transportation artery between China and the Soviet Union. Railway surveyors are working diligently on this section, seeking the shortest route for the traffic between the two nations.
    The terrain here is extremely complex, featuring vast expanses of the Gobi Desert, reed marshes difficult to traverse, saline-alkali lands, and salt lakes, as well as narrow mountain passes. Many places have historically been sparsely populated, with only the occasional yurt dotting the endless grasslands, housing a single family. The climate is erratic, making working conditions very harsh.
    Twenty kilometers west of Tuotuo, you enter the desert area centered around Shaquanzi. This desert is highly mobile, and the railway's passage through here poses a significant threat due to the shifting sands. How should the roadbed pass through this area to avoid being buried by the quicksand? What measures should be taken here to prevent the wind and sand? These are all crucial questions. Based on the suggestions of Soviet experts, it is necessary to observe and record the wind speed, wind direction, and the movement of quicksand here. The desert observation team of the 25th Comprehensive Detachment is undertaking this arduous task.
    The snow-capped peaks of the Tianshan Mountains glisten with dazzling light, but at noon, the Gobi Desert exudes a suffocating heat. The comrades of the desert observation team not only encounter water shortages here, but the desert, scorched by the sun, also evaporates into a hazy white vapor, making it impossible to clearly see a leveling staff placed 400 meters away through the theodolite's eyepiece, hindering the accurate calculation of elevation differences and stadia distances. To ensure accurate measurements, they shortened the distance, measuring every 200 meters instead of every 400 meters.
    More than twenty kilometers west beyond the desert, one encounters reed marshes, saline-alkali lands, and salt lakes. During last year's preliminary survey, it was believed that these areas would be difficult to pass through, requiring a detour to one side to reach Alataw Pass. This would have lengthened the route. However, preliminary measurements in early March this year suggested the need for further exploration of the geological and topographic conditions here, in order to find a more economical route. This bold undertaking fell upon the shoulders of the 25th Comprehensive Detachment.
    What conditions lay ahead, and would the route be passable? No one could say for sure. From a distance, all that could be seen was a yellowish expanse. Upon closer inspection, it turned out to be clusters of reeds that had already withered, with a marsh below. A pole could be inserted but would not reach the bottom. The reeds grew as densely as wheat and were as thick as small bamboo poles. Since ancient times, these wild plants had grown and decayed year after year. Over time, this formed a layer of reed stalks on the marsh, so that when one stepped on it, it would sink in one place and rise in another. Not only would ordinary people dare not enter this place, but even the bravest hunters would only venture to the edges of the reed beds during the freezing season.
    How to get through? How to start working? The comrades of the flag team took flags and acted as pioneers, stepping on the already fallen reed stalks, pushing aside the upright reeds, and advancing step by step. Uyghur workers followed behind, cutting down the erect reeds to clear a path. The comrades of the alignment team, the leveling team, and the topographic team then began their work on top. The reeds were very soft, and the tripods were always unstable when placed on them, making leveling extremely difficult. The wind, the slightest movement, or even uneven breathing, would cause the mirror to waver, making leveling impossible. The instrument operators often stood there for a long time, staring intently at the eyepiece, barely daring to breathe, concentrating on waiting for the moment when leveling was possible. Obtaining a single elevation difference often took a lot of time. The comrades of the topographic team had to measure the landforms on both sides of the line. The reeds were four to five meters tall, making it impossible to see a leveling staff erected on the ground from the outside. They came up with a solution: one person stood on another person's shoulders and held up the leveling staff, allowing the topographic surveying to proceed smoothly in the reed marsh area.
    After crossing the reed marsh area, they had to traverse more than eight kilometers of saline-alkali land and salt lakes. The saline-alkali land, also known as slough, had a surface covered with white salt crystals, appearing dry, but underneath was soft mud. When you stepped on it, you would sink in immediately. If you mustered the strength to pull that foot out, the other foot would sink in, and sink in even deeper. After a few attempts, you would be exhausted. How to pass through this area was a problem. The staff came up with a solution: walking in a quincunx pattern, stepping on the camel grass growing on the slough. The leaves of the camel grass, spread flat on the slough, had a kind of buoyancy that could reduce the risk of sinking.
    Alataw Pass, on the national border, is located between two large mountains, in a valley. The wind here is very strong, strong enough to push people, and it blows for long periods, carrying gravel the size of peas and torrential rain. The surveyors often had to fight against this strong wind. When they first arrived, they did not understand the situation and lived in a local Kazakh family's sheep pen. Suddenly, in the middle of the night, the wind rose and blew away all the reeds covering the sheep pen, and sand and soil poured in. The tent, not securely fastened, was also overturned by the wind, and quilts and bedding were blown into the air. Several people chased after them, and it took a long time to find them. After the wind rose, there was no way to walk, eyes could not be opened, and work was even more impossible. After living there for some time, the surveyors learned the patterns of the wind and figured out how to fight it. The wind here always rose at three or four o'clock in the afternoon and stopped at four o'clock in the morning. Based on this pattern, they adjusted their working hours. They got up and rushed to the construction site as soon as it was light, starting work as soon as they could see. They stopped working before the wind rose in the afternoon. This still ensured eight hours of work.
    Now, the 25th Comprehensive Detachment has completed most of the preliminary route survey's outdoor operations. The new route they found is 42 kilometers shorter than the originally surveyed route.
    The 25th Comprehensive Detachment is still working on this section of the line, but they are now carrying out a more detailed fixed-point survey than the preliminary survey.

    兰新路的最西段燕树桂
    从新疆乌苏以西的托托，沿着艾比湖的边沿，向西北方向伸展，到达中苏国境线上的阿拉山口，有一百一十九公里多的路程。这就是我国通往苏联的国际铁路干线——兰州—乌鲁木齐—阿克斗卡铁路，在我国境内最靠西的一段。为给中苏两国人民往来的交通要道寻找最短的路线，铁路勘测人员正在这段线路上辛勤地忙碌着。
    这里的地形极为复杂，有广阔的戈壁，有举步艰难的芦苇沼泽地区、盐碱地带和盐池，有狭窄的山口。很多地方历来都罕有人迹，绵绵草原，只偶尔有一个蒙古包，住有一户人家。气候变化无常，工作条件十分艰苦。
    从托托西行二十公里，便进入以沙泉子为中心的沙漠地带。这个沙漠流动得比较厉害，铁路要从这里通过，流沙造成很大的威胁。路基在这里怎样通过，才能避免被流沙埋没呢？应该在这里采取哪些措施，才能阻挡住风沙呢？这些都是很重要的问题。根据苏联专家的建议，必须在这里观察和纪录风速、风向和流沙流动的情况。第二十五综合分队的沙漠观察小组担负了这个艰巨的任务。
    天山上皑皑的白雪，闪着耀眼的寒光，可是中午的戈壁滩上却散发出闷人的炽热。沙漠观察小组的同志在这里不只遇到缺水的困难，而且沙漠被太阳晒得蒸发出白蒙蒙的一片蒸气，地形尺竖在四百公尺远的地方，从经纬仪的视孔里根本看不清楚，无法正确计算出高差和视距。为了保证测量得准确，他们就把距离缩短，由四百公尺一测量缩短为二百公尺一测量。
    走出沙漠西行二十多公里，又遇到芦苇沼泽地区、盐碱地带和盐池。去年踏勘时，认为这些地方不容易通过，必须从一侧绕过去，才能到达阿拉山口。这样线路就拖长了。今年3月初测，觉得有必要进一步探明这里的地质地形情况，以便找出一条更经济的线路。这个大胆的尝试工作落在第二十五综合分队的肩上。
    前面有些什么情况，线路能不能通过呢？谁也说不上来。远远望去，只见米黄色的一片；走到跟前仔细一瞧，原来是一丛丛已经干死了的芦苇，下面是沼泽，花杆插下去，探不到底。芦苇长得像麦子一样密，粗得像小竹竿一样。从古老的年代起，这些野生的植物，一年一年地成长起来，一年又一年地衰颓下去。这样年多日久，就在沼泽上架起一层芦苇秆，脚一踩，这里陷下去，别的地方升起来。这个地方，别说一般人不敢进去，就是最勇敢的猎人，也只有在冰冻的季节，才在芦苇地带的边沿转转。
    怎么穿过去呢？怎么展开工作呢？大旗组的同志，拿上旗子打先锋，踏在已经倒下去的芦苇秆上，拨开挺立的芦苇，一节一节地向里面走。维吾尔族工人跟在后面，割倒直立的芦苇，开辟出道路。导线组、水平组、地形组的同志再在上面展开工作。芦苇是很松软的，三角架放在上面总是不稳当，抄平非常困难。风一吹，脚一动，甚至于出气一不均匀，镜子就幌动，抄平工作无法进行。司镜的同志，为了一个高差，常常呆呆地在那里站很久，凝视着视孔，气都不敢出，集中精力等待那能够抄平的一瞬间。一个高差常常花去很多时间。地形组的同志，是要把线路两侧的地貌测出来。芦苇高达四、五公尺，板尺竖在地上，外面根本看不见。他们想出一个办法，一个人站在另一个人的肩上，再把板尺举起来，使地形测量工作在芦苇沼泽地带顺利进行。
    穿过芦苇沼泽地区，又要经过八公里多长的盐碱地带和盐池。盐碱地带，即翻浆地带，地面上是白色的盐碱结晶体，看起来是干的，下面却是松软的泥浆。脚在上面一踩，马上就陷下去，假若你鼓足气力拔这条脚，等到拔出后，另一条脚又陷下去，而且陷的更深。三拔两拔，一会儿就精疲力尽了。怎样从这里通过，很成问题。工作人员想出一个办法，走梅花步，踩着翻浆上的骆驼草，在上面歪歪扭扭地跳着走。原来，骆驼草的叶子，平铺在翻浆上，有一种浮力，可以减少陷下去的危险。
    国境线上的阿拉山口，位于两座大山之间，是一个山谷地带。这里的风很大，刮起来，可以把人推着走，而且刮的时间久，挟有豌豆大的石子和急雨。勘测人员经常要和这种大风作斗争。他们初到这里时，不了解情况，住在当地独有的一户哈萨克族居民的羊圈里。突然半夜风起，把羊圈上架的芦苇全部掀走，沙土一涌而进。住的帐篷拴得不结实，也被风掀翻，棉被、褥子吹到半空，几个人跟踪追，好一阵才找到。风起后，没有办法走路，眼也睁不开，工作更不能作。勘测人员住了一些时间，掌握了风的规律，摸索出和风作斗争的方法。这里的风，都是下午三四点钟起，早晨四点停。他们根据这个规律，调整了工作时间。早晨天刚亮就起床向工地赶，稍微能看见便开始工作。下午风未起就收工。这样仍保证了八小时的工作。
    现在，第二十五综合分队已经完成了大部分线路初测的室外作业。他们寻找出的新的线路，较原来踏勘的线路缩短了四十二公里。
    第二十五综合分队还在这段线路上工作着，不过，进行的已经是比初测更为细致的定测工作了。
