A Manifestation of Bureaucracy – The Excessive Publication of Internal Publications
Speech by Comrade Tang Lin

I fully agree with the reports of Comrades Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, and Deng Xiaoping, and I am determined to strive to realize the resolutions of this congress.

How to overcome bureaucracy and red tape, improve leadership methods, and increase work efficiency is a question that our entire party is constantly and deeply concerned with. Now I would like to talk about something closely related to this issue that has not been seriously resolved: that is, the internal publications of the Party, government, and people's organizations are being run somewhat excessively, with too many in number, low in quality, repetitive and wasteful, and there is a need to clean them up and rectify them.

**Over a Thousand Internal Publications in Hunan Province**

We have long heard many criticisms, and the Hunan Provincial Party Committee has also entrusted several relevant departments to try to streamline them, but encountered many obstacles. In addition, we ourselves did not pay close attention. Not only have they not been streamlined, but the number of publications has greatly increased in the past two years. According to a recent rough survey, provincial-level departments in Hunan Province issue a total of 69 kinds of publications, prefectural and special district organs issue a total of 160 kinds, county-level organs issue 505 kinds, plus publications from factories and mining enterprises, totaling about 1,000 kinds, which can be described as a "flourishing literary style." The most prominent are the supply and marketing, grain, banking, taxation, and procurement departments, which have publications at every level from the province to the county. According to a survey in Xiangtan Prefecture, the various units in the prefecture publish a total of 202 kinds of publications, of which 90 belong to the finance and trade departments, accounting for nearly half.

To run these publications, many departments have special organizations such as editorial sections and full-time cadres. Some publications are very large. For example, "Hunan Forestry Communication" sometimes reaches more than 60,000 words in one issue, which cannot be done without a set of office institutions.

**Causes a Great Waste of Manpower and Resources**

To support this batch of publications, not only does it consume a lot of manpower and money, but it also increases the tension in printing factories and paper markets. In previous years, textbooks for elementary schools in the autumn had to be printed in March, but this year they were not printed until May. Farmers' textbooks and advanced accounting teaching materials, etc., could not be published in a timely manner in the required quantities. If fewer internal publications were produced, these kinds of difficulties would be reduced considerably. However, what annoys everyone the most is the consumption of a lot of manpower and time for receiving, sending, registering, keeping, and checking. General internal publications have regulations such as "keep properly" and "do not lose," and some must be returned on schedule. After receiving them, each unit must issue them by department, by position level, and by name, and at a certain time, they must be checked, archived, or returned. As for individuals who receive a large number of internal publications, it is even more difficult. For example, the secretary of the Xiangtan Prefectural Committee reflected that he received more than 40 kinds of internal publications a month, most of which were of little use, but he had to spend a lot of effort on keeping and returning them.

**A Kind of Prejudice: Work Cannot Be Done Well Without Running a Publication**

Some publications are quite wonderful and lively, which is very helpful for exchanging experiences, guiding business, and improving the policy and ideological level of cadres. Unfortunately, most publications are not well-run, or are occasionally good but often not good. However, some comrades have developed a firm view that the most important thing to lead the work of their competent departments is to have their own publication, and it seems that if they do not run one, they will not be able to do a good job. Once a publication is started, it has a certain "specification," such as publication period, number of pages, layout, etc. Therefore, even if there is nothing, they have to stuff something in, whether it is documents that have appeared everywhere, newspaper comments that everyone can see, or communiqués that everyone knows, they still publish them as usual, in order to show their importance. The grand meetings of their departments and units are all included without exception, from the opening speech to the closing speech.

We have tried to rectify them, but each has its own reasons for demanding the right to survive and develop, such as "business needs," "mass demands," and so on. Indeed, the masses have demands, and many cadres often complain that they have not seen Party publications. We have not paid enough attention to this requirement of many cadres. For example, most Party member cadres in schools have not been taken care of. Although there are many internal publications in finance and trade enterprises, few cadres actually see publications related to the Party's political life and policy ideology. This is an urgent problem to be solved, but it cannot be used as an excuse for indiscriminate publication. In short, if we do not find a way to streamline them now, internal publications will become increasingly unfavorable to work. I think that running publications indiscriminately is a kind of bureaucratic phenomenon and a great waste of manpower and resources. Despite the difficulties, it is still necessary to streamline them.

### 官僚主义的一种表现——滥办内部刊物  唐麟同志的发言

    官僚主义的一种表现——滥办内部刊物
    唐麟同志的发言
    我完全同意刘少奇同志、周恩来同志、邓小平同志的报告，并决心为实现这次大会的决议而奋斗。
    如何克服官僚主义和文牍主义，改进领导方法，提高工作效率，这是我们全党所经常十分关心的问题。现在我想谈谈与这个问题很有关系但是一直没有认真解决的一件事情：这就是党、政府、人民团体的内部刊物办得有些滥了，数量太多，质量不高，重复浪费，有加以清理整顿的必要。
    湖南一省内部刊物上千
    我们早已听到许多批评意见，并且湖南省委也曾委托过几个有关部门设法进行精简，但是遇到了很多障碍，加上自己抓得不紧，不但没有精简，这两年来刊物反而大大加多了。据最近的粗略调查，湖南省一级各部门所发行的刊物共达六十九种，地专机关发行的共达一百六十种，县级机关的五百零五种，加上厂矿企业部门的刊物，共计约有一千种，可谓“文风鼎盛”。较突出的是供销、粮食、银行、税务、采购等部门，由省到县，也层层办有刊物。据湘潭专区调查，专区各单位办的刊物共有二百零二种，其中属于财贸部门的达九十种，占了将近一半。
    为了办刊物，许多部门设有编辑科之类专门机构和专职干部。有些刊物很庞大，例如“湖南林业通讯”，有时一期达六万余字，那是非有一套办事机构不行的。
    造成人力物力的很大浪费
    为了支持这一批刊物，不但耗费许多人力和金钱，并且增加了印刷工厂和纸张市场的紧张。秋季小学教科书往年在三月份就必须开印，但今年到五月才开印。农民课本和高级社会计教材等等都不能及时按需要数量出版。如果少办些内部刊物，这类困难就会减轻许多。但是，最使大家感到恼火的，还在于消耗了不少的人力和时间来收发、登记、保管、清查。一般内部刊物都有“妥为保存”、“不得遗失”等规定，有一部分还要按期清退，各单位收到它们之后必须按部门、按职别级别，指名签发，到一定时候又必须清查归档或退还。至于收到大批内部刊物的个人更是为难，例如湘潭地委书记反映，他一个月便收到四十余种内部刊物，多数没有什么作用，却不能不为保存和清退费很多手脚。
    一种成见：不办刊物就作不好工作
    有些刊物办得相当精彩，也生动有味，对于交流经验、指导业务，提高干部政策思想水平，有很大好处。可惜多数刊物办得不好，或是偶然好而常常不好。但是有些同志却养成了一种牢固的见解，认为要把自己主管部门的工作领导起来最要紧的事就是自己要有一个刊物，并且似乎假如不办就没有法子搞好工作。刊物一经办起来，就有一定“规格”，如刊期、页数、版面等等，于是没有东西也得塞进些东西，管它是到处出现过了的文件，一般人都可看到的报纸评论，大家都知道了的公报，也还是照样刊登，借以自重；本部门本单位的大会议，那更是从开幕词到闭幕词都收揽无遗。
    我们曾经企图整顿，然而各有一套要求生存和发展之权的理由，例如“业务需要”，“群众要求”等等。确实，群众是有要求的，经常有许多干部在抱怨没有看到党刊。我们确实对许多干部的这个要求注意不够，例如多数学校中的党员干部就没有照顾；财经企业部门内部刊物虽多，但真正看到有关党的政治生活和政策思想的刊物的干部却很少。这是亟待解决的一个问题，但不能给滥办刊物者作为借口。总之，现在如不设法精简，内部刊物对工作会越来越不利，我觉得，乱办刊物，是官僚主义现象的一种，也是人力物力很大的浪费，尽管有困难，仍非精简不可。
