Xinhua News Agency, September 26th, New York News: On the eve of the United Nations Security Council meeting to discuss the Suez Canal issue, representatives of various countries to the United Nations are engaging in frequent diplomatic activities regarding the meeting agenda.

    The United Nations Headquarters officially announced on the 25th that the Security Council's meeting on the 26th will have a two-point provisional agenda when discussing procedural matters. The two points are: (1) The issue raised by France and the United Kingdom regarding "the situation created by the Egyptian government's unilateral action to end the international management system of the Suez Canal affirmed and completed by the 1888 Suez Canal Convention." (2) The issue raised by Egypt regarding "the actions taken by certain countries, particularly France and the United Kingdom, against Egypt, which constitute a threat to international peace and security and seriously violate the United Nations Charter."
    The President of the Security Council, Cuban representative Núñez Portuondo, announced on the 25th that he had informed the British and French representatives that Cuba would support including both the British-French and Egyptian proposals on the agenda for substantive discussion at the meeting.

    According to reports, the representatives of Britain, France, and the United States held a series of "in-depth" talks with representatives of other members of the Security Council on the 25th to seek their support. Sources say that Western countries are preparing to gather a majority vote in the Security Council to prevent Egypt's complaint from being included on the agenda. Egyptian Ambassador to the United Nations, Lautfi, met with Núñez Portuondo on the 25th at the latter's request. He also held discussions with representatives of Arab countries and members of the Security Council. Lautfi said that evening: "We will not be satisfied unless our issue is included on the agenda as is. I have asked the Iranian representative to do his utmost to demand that this issue be included on the agenda."

    安理会会前活动紧张
    英法美企图阻止讨论埃及建议
    据新华社26日讯　纽约消息：在联合国安全理事会开会讨论苏伊士运河问题的前夕，各国驻联合国代表正在为会议议程问题展开频繁的外交活动。
    联合国总部已经在25日正式宣布，安理会26日会议在讨论程序问题的时候将有一项两点临时议程。这两点是：（一）法国和英国提出的关于“由于埃及政府以片面行动结束了为1888年苏伊士运河公约所肯定和完成的国际管理苏伊士运河制度而造成的形势”问题。（二）埃及提出的“关于某些国家、特别是法国和联合王国对埃及采取的行动，构成了对国际和平和安全的威胁，并且严重地违反了联合国宪章”的问题。
    安全理事会主席、古巴代表努奈斯—波图翁多25日宣布说，他已经告诉英法代表，古巴将支持把英法和埃及的两个提案都列入会议进行实质讨论时的议程。
    据报道，英、法、美三国代表同安全理事会其他理事国代表25日举行了一系列“深入的”会谈，以争取它们的支持。有消息说，西方国家准备在安理会中纠合多数票来阻止把埃及的控诉列入议程。埃及驻联合国代表劳特菲25日应努奈斯—波图翁多的请求会见了他。他还同阿拉伯国家代表和安全理事会理事进行了商谈。劳特菲在当天晚上说：“除非原封不动地把我们的问题列入议程，我们是不会满意的。我已经要求伊朗代表竭力要求把这个问题列入议程”。
