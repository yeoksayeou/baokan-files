I come to you from a country whose majestic Himalayas form a five-hundred-mile-long common border with your country. However, this time I did not come here via this long and natural border, but through a detour of thousands of kilometers, passing through different climates and countries inhabited by different races. But, friends, as soon as I left Hong Kong and crossed the border into your friendly and hospitable country, you gave me such a welcome that I no longer feel like a stranger here. The style of clothes I wear is indeed different from the style of clothes you wear. I regret to say that I cannot speak even half a sentence of your country's language, which is considered one of the most beautiful languages in the world. There may be other things that show the differences between us. However, when we consider that our traditional friendship has been able to continue and strengthen in all the changing historical eras, we can conclude that there are more and more significant things we have in common, influences that are conducive to our friendly relations, and that these influences outweigh those that are not conducive to our friendly relations, both in quantity and importance. I recall how in past times, Chinese scholars such as the Tang Dynasty's eminent monk Xuanzang and the Eastern Jin Dynasty's eminent monk Faxian, attracted by the true beauty of the tenet of universal brotherhood and love preached by Nepal's greatest son, Sakyamuni, travelled over mountains and rivers to Nepal. Buddhist legends also vividly mention and enthusiastically praise another eminent Chinese monk, Tsongkhapa, who is said to have drained the lake water of the Kathmandu Valley, which was once a lake, so that it could be inhabited by humans, and so it remains to this day. The story of our friendship is written page by page through countless generations from prehistoric times to the present. History cannot record when the first contact of friendship between our two countries was established. History cannot trace the starting point of our friendship; it can only record how this traditional friendship has been rapidly developed in recent days and consolidated in the exchange of diplomatic missions between the two countries. It can only record how we signed a treaty of friendship this month and how we sent Nepal's first cultural delegation to other countries, to China, in August of this year, to further affirm our desire to increase various friendly exchanges between our two countries. As a result, I believe that China and Nepal have become closer in recent times than ever before. Today I want to affirm here the traditional friendship between our two countries, which is not only important to us, but also of great significance to the cause of international understanding and world peace. I am undertaking a friendly and goodwill visit, and I bring with me the goodwill and friendly greetings of the King and people of Nepal to the Chinese government and people. Therefore, if my visit to your country can, in addition to further strengthening the friendly relations and mutual respect that have existed between our two countries since ancient times, make some contribution to strengthening and developing world peace, I will consider my efforts not to have been in vain.

    阿查里雅首相在广州车站上的讲话
    我是从这样一个国家到你们这里来的，这个国家的雄伟的喜马拉雅山同你们的国家形成了五百英里长的共同的边界。但是，我这次到你们这里来并没有通过这条漫长的和天然的边界线，而是通过几千公里的迂回路程，经过了不同的气候和由不同的种族所居住的国家来到这里的。但是，朋友们，一当我离开香港通过边境进入你们友好的和好客的国家，你们给予我这样的欢迎，因此我不再感到我在这里是一个陌生人。我所穿的衣服的式样和你们所穿的衣服的式样的确是不一样的。我遗憾地说，对被认为是世界上最优美的语言之一的贵国的语言，我也说不出一言半语。可能还有其他的一些东西可以显示出我们之间的不同。但是，当我们考虑到，我们的传统友谊能够在所有变化多端的历史时代里继续存在和不断增强，我们就能作出结论，我们之间有更多的更重大的共同东西，有有利于我们之间友好联系的影响，这种影响无论在数量上和重要性上都胜过不利于我们之间友好联系的影响。我回想起在过去的时代里，像唐朝的高僧玄奘和东晋的高僧法显这些中国的学者，在尼泊尔最伟大的儿子释迦牟尼所宣扬的普天之下皆兄弟和友爱的宏旨的真正的美的吸引下，曾经如何跋山涉水地来到尼泊尔。佛家传说里还生动地提到了和热烈颂扬了中国另一位高僧宗喀巴，传说他曾经汲干了一度是湖泽的加德满都谷的湖水，使它能够为人类所居住，就这样一直到现在。我们之间的友谊的故事，是通过从史前一直到现在的无数世代一页一页地写起来的。历史无法记载我们两国之间第一次建立友谊的接触是在什么时候。历史无法追溯我们的友谊的起点，它只能记载这种传统的友谊在最近的日子里如何得到了迅速的发展和在两国之间互派外交代表团的行动中得到了巩固，它只能记载我们两国之间如何在本月间签订了友好协定以及如何在今年8月间派遣了尼泊尔历史上第一个派往其他国家的文化代表团前往中国，以进一步肯定我们两国的增加各种友好往来的愿望。结果，我相信，中国和尼泊尔在最近的时期内已经比过去更加接近。今天我要在这里肯定我们两国之间的传统的友谊，这种友谊不但对我们是重要的，而且对国际谅解和世界和平的事业也是有重大意义的。我在进行一次友好和亲善的访问，我带着尼泊尔国王和人民对中国政府和人民的亲善和友好的问候，因此，如果我对贵国的访问除了进一步加强我们两国之间从远古起就已存在的友好的关系和彼此的尊敬以外，还能够对加强和发展世界和平有某些贡献的话，我将认为我的努力并不是徒劳的。（附图片）
