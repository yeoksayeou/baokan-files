Editorial:

    There are currently many serious problems in nursing work. The main ones are the low quality of nursing work and the widespread feeling among nurses that they have no future. The occurrence of this phenomenon is partly due to some nurses' insufficient understanding of their own work, but mainly it is because nursing work has not received the attention it deserves.
    Before liberation, the nursing profession was regarded as a lowly job of serving people. The reactionary government at the time paid no attention to nursing work at all. After liberation, nursing work improved, and the number of nurses trained increased year by year. However, the incorrect views on nursing work inherited from the old society have not been completely eliminated in the minds of many people, and have not even been completely eliminated among some people in the health departments. This is, of course, very detrimental to the normal development of nursing work.
    The lack of due attention to nursing work is first reflected in the improper use and arrangement of nurses. In this regard, a relatively common phenomenon is not to use nurses as technical personnel. Some units even reduced logistical staff and increased nurses to do logistical work when reorganizing personnel. Some nurses who have received many years of nursing education and have many years of rich experience are not properly arranged or have to change careers simply because they are older. Some units even stipulate that nurses over the age of 35 are not hired. Among nurses, there is this saying: "Doctors are more respected the older they get, and nurses are more despised the older they get."
    The lack of due attention to nursing work is also reflected in the lack of concern for nurses' working conditions, professional learning, and living conditions; the scope of nurses' responsibilities is not clear enough, and there are no certain standards for the requirements of nursing work. In-service training for nurses is generally poorly organized. Nurses are not given due encouragement to develop professionally, and there are no advanced professional schools to study at. There is almost no source of nursing teachers. There are also some problems in the promotion system for nurses. In addition, many nurses have not received the care they deserve in terms of living conditions.
    Some individual patients even think that they are "paying to get medical treatment" and do not respect the labor of nurses at all.
    The labor of nurses is noble and should be respected. The Communist Party has always regarded the work of doctors and nurses as a sacred cause of "healing the wounded and rescuing the dying, and practicing revolutionary humanitarianism" and attaches importance to it. Despising any kind of technical work has always been opposed by the Party. As early as before the national liberation, there were many model nurses in the revolutionary base areas, who, together with model workers and labor heroes in other industries, were commended by the Party and the revolutionary government.
    It is difficult for us to imagine how a patient, especially a seriously ill patient, can alleviate the pain of the disease, obtain a comfortable environment, and recover smoothly without the help of nurses. Only under the care of nurses can patients receive the warmth of a family and the care of brothers and sisters, and can they receive help in fighting the disease. Nurses are specialized technical personnel who use scientific methods to care for patients. They can rationally arrange the patient's life, use their skills to cooperate with the doctor's work, and play a great role in relieving the patient's pain, shortening the course of the disease, and preventing complications. A doctor with rich experience and knowledge cannot complete the treatment task well without the cooperation of nurses. When doctors deal with complex diseases and perform complex operations, they need more technically skilled nurses to cooperate. The view that treatment work can be done by doctors alone and that nurses are unimportant is completely wrong.
    The work of nurses and the work of doctors are two important components of treatment work. Both are based on scientific medical theory, but they have their own specializations in application. Nurses work according to the doctor's instructions, but implementing the doctor's instructions is not a simple matter. Nurses must understand the rules of various diseases, must always be good at observing subtle changes in diseases, must understand the patient's psychology, must grasp the specific situation of each patient, and must also be familiar with the possible impact of dietary habits and other living details on the body, so that they can accurately reflect the patient's symptoms to the doctor, and at the same time make the doctor's instructions perfectly realized. Therefore, nursing work has technical characteristics and cannot be completely included in the doctor's work.
    To change the incorrect view of nursing work, we should start with the health departments first. It is also the responsibility of the health departments to raise the general public's awareness of nursing work. The health departments should pay attention to publicizing the important role of nursing work in the entire health work. Some major issues in the nursing work system and nursing education should be studied and resolved with reference to the practices of various scientifically advanced countries in these areas, combined with China's specific conditions, and nurses should be encouraged to regard their own business as a profession and strive to advance towards science.
    Nurses should take a positive attitude towards improving their own work, seriously provide opinions; at the same time, they should stick to their jobs, be conscientious and diligent, do their work better, work hard to study, strive for excellence, and improve their professional level, so that nursing work will be increasingly understood and valued by people. At the same time, it should also be emphasized that improving nursing work is a major event related to the people's health cause, and all parties should give strong support.

### 尊重护士的高尚劳动

    尊重护士的高尚劳动
    目前在护士工作中有不少严重的问题，主要是护士工作质量不高，护士比较普遍地感到没有前途。这种现象的发生，固然部分地由于有些护士对本身工作认识不足，但是主要的还是由于护士工作没有受到应有的重视。
    在解放以前，护士职业被看作是一种侍候人的低贱职业。当时的反动政府对护士工作根本不闻不问。解放以后，护士工作有了改进，培养出来的护士在逐年增加。但是，从旧社会遗留下来的对护士工作的不正确的看法，在很多人的心目中，还没有完全消除，就是在卫生部门的有些人中间，也还没有完全消除。这对于护士工作的正常发展，当然是非常不利的。
    护士工作没有受到应有的重视，首先表现在对护士的使用和安排不当。在这方面，比较普遍的现象是不把护士当做技术人员来使用。有的单位甚至在整编人员的时候，裁减勤杂人员，增加护士来兼做勤杂工作。有些既受过多年护士教育又有多年丰富经验的护士，仅仅因为年纪大了，而得不到适当的安排，或者不得不改行。甚至有的单位规定，不收三十五岁以上的护士。在护士中间，有这样的议论：“医生愈老愈受尊重，护士愈老愈被轻视。”
    护士工作没有受到应有的重视还表现在对护士的工作条件、业务学习和生活待遇不够关心；护士的职责范围不够明确，对护士工作的要求没有一定的标准。护士的在职学习一般是组织得不好的。护士向专业发展没有得到应有的鼓励，也没有高级的专业学校可以进修。护士师资几乎没有来源。在护士的晋级制度方面，也有一些问题。另外，在生活方面，很多护士也没有得到应有的照顾。
    有个别的病人，甚至以为自己是“花钱来治病”的，对于护士的劳动很不尊重。
    护士的劳动是高尚的，应当受到尊重。共产党一向是把医生工作和护士工作看做“救死扶伤，实行革命的人道主义”的神圣事业而加以重视的。鄙薄任何一种技术工作，一向都为党所反对。远在全国解放以前，在革命根据地里，就有不少模范护士，和其他各行各业的工作模范、劳动英雄一起，受到党和革命政府的表扬。
    我们很难想像，一个病人，特别是一个重病人，如果没有护士的帮助，怎么能够减轻疾病的痛苦，得到舒适的环境，顺利地恢复健康。病人只有在护士的关怀下，才能得到像家庭一样的温暖和像兄弟姊妹一样的体贴，才能得到向疾病作斗争的助力。护士是用科学方法护理病人的专门技术人才。她能够合理地安排病人的生活，运用她的技术来配合医生的工作，在解除病人痛苦、缩短病程和预防合并症方面起很大的作用。一个富有经验和学识的医生，如果没有护士的配合，也不能很好地完成治疗任务。医生在处理复杂的疾病和施行复杂的手术的时候，更加需要有技术熟练的护士来配合。认为单靠医生就能做好治疗工作，护士无关重要，这种观点是完全错误的。
    护士的工作和医生的工作是治疗工作的两个重要组成部分。两者同样以科学的医学理论为基础，但在应用方面则各有所专。护士是根据医生的规定来进行工作的，但是贯彻医生的规定并不是一件简单的事情。护士必须懂得各种疾病的规律，必须时时刻刻善于体察疾病的细微变化，必须了解病人的心理，必须掌握每个病人的具体情况，还必须熟悉饮食起居等生活细节对于身体可能产生的影响，才能把病人的症状准确地反映给医生，同时使医生的规定尽善尽美地实现。因此，护士工作有技术上的特点，绝不是医生的工作所能完全包括的。
    要改变对护士工作不正确的看法，首先应该从卫生部门做起。提高社会一般人士对护士工作的认识，也是卫生部门的责任。卫生部门要注意宣传护士工作在整个卫生工作中的重要作用。在护士工作制度和护士教育方面有一些重大问题，应该参照各个科学先进的国家在这些方面的作法，结合我国的具体情况，加以研究和解决，并且要鼓励护士以自身的业务作为专业，努力向科学进军。
    护士对于改进本身工作，要采取积极的态度，认真提供意见；同时，应该坚守自己的工作岗位，兢兢业业，勤勤恳恳，把工作做得更好，努力钻研，精益求精，把业务水平更加提高，使护士工作日益被人们所了解和重视。同时，还应该强调，改进护士工作，是关系人民健康事业的一件大事，各方面都要给以有力的支持。
