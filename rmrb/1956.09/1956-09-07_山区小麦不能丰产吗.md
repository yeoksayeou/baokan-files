    Can Wheat in Mountainous Areas Achieve High Yields?
    By our reporter Zhu Bo
    In recent years, Shaanxi Province has made great achievements in wheat production. This year, the wheat acreage has expanded by more than three million mu compared to 1949, and the yield per mu has increased from over 100 jin in 1950 to over 200 jin. However, the increase in wheat production is mainly in the Guanzhong Plain, where the yield per mu has increased from dozens of jin in the early days of liberation to over 300 jin. The wheat fields in the mountainous areas are not like this; the acreage is very unstable, and the rate of increase is very slow. In some counties in northern Shaanxi, the yield per mu of wheat fields is still around 30 or 40 jin.
    What are the reasons why wheat yields in mountainous areas cannot be increased?
    From the perspective of agricultural departments, when studying the issue of high wheat yields in the early days of national liberation, the focus was placed on the wheat fields in the Guanzhong area (which was correct). However, for several years, the leadership has neglected the leadership of high wheat yields in mountainous areas. Whenever the issue of high wheat yields in mountainous areas is raised, many people's minds are filled with dry loess plateaus, crisscrossing ravines, overlapping hills, and natural conditions with hail and frost. Some people also use the excuse that the wheat acreage in mountainous areas is small and the wheat fields are scattered, and they despise wheat production in mountainous areas. Many people show difficulty when mentioning the issue of high wheat yields in mountainous areas. Therefore, regardless of the supply of new agricultural tools and fertilizers, or the promotion of improved wheat varieties, the leadership first thinks of the Guanzhong wheat fields. Even if some instructions are issued, they often start from the situation in the Guanzhong area and do not take into account the characteristics of wheat fields in mountainous areas.
    As a result, many new cultivation techniques have not been promoted in mountainous areas. In Guanzhong, most of the wheat fields have systematically adopted new technologies such as deep plowing, fertilization, weeding, and strip planting with close spacing. In mountainous areas, the above-mentioned series of new cultivation techniques have not been promoted. Most farmers still use old cultivation techniques, with rough land preparation, mixed and degenerated wheat seeds, and most of the wheat fields are still using the broadcast sowing method. Therefore, wheat grows very poorly, and yields are very low.
    Can wheat in mountainous areas achieve high yields? The answer should be yes. The problem lies in how the leading departments can discover and create conditions for high wheat yields in mountainous areas and specifically organize farmers in mountainous areas to utilize these conditions.
    In mountainous areas, the potential for high wheat yields is great. Improved varieties can also be promoted in mountainous areas, increasing fertilizer, strip planting with close spacing, and deep plowing to conserve moisture. Many agricultural cooperatives in northern Shaanxi have already attempted technical reforms. Experiments with planting Ukrainian wheat have been carried out in many places in river valleys and mountains, and the results have proved that this variety is suitable for the natural conditions in northern Shaanxi, with yields exceeding local native wheat varieties by 30% to 50%. The Ukrainian wheat planted by the Yangshan Agricultural Cooperative in Yan'an County had thick stalks and large ears of wheat, with a yield per mu more than 70 jin higher than the local Yan'an wheat variety. Many agricultural cooperatives in northern Shaanxi have also conducted strip planting with close spacing experiments on wheat, which proves that this is also a major measure to increase wheat yields in mountainous areas. In the past, the wheat yield in the Baijiawan Agricultural Cooperative in Wubu County was only around 50 or 60 jin. This year, they adopted new cultivation techniques, and the six mu of high-yield land yielded more than 150 jin of wheat per mu, which is much higher than the average wheat yield of the whole village. The amount of wheat sown in the northern Shaanxi area is generally only five or six jin per mu. Now, many agricultural cooperatives have begun to increase the amount of seeds sown on small areas of wheat fields and changed from dibbling and broadcasting to strip planting, which shows that this change is not difficult.
    Many facts prove that wheat fields in mountainous areas have the conditions for technical reform, and it is possible to increase wheat yields. This year, agricultural cooperativization has been realized in mountainous areas, which provides favorable conditions for high wheat yields in mountainous areas. Of course, it is not without difficulties to improve wheat planting techniques in mountainous areas. For example, farmers in mountainous areas live scattered, and wheat fields are not concentrated enough. The wheat acreage in one county is not even as large as the wheat acreage in one district in Guanzhong. Therefore, there are inconveniences in organizing technical learning and other aspects. However, these difficulties can be overcome.
    At present, the issue of high wheat yields in mountainous areas has attracted the attention of the agricultural departments of Shaanxi Province, and technical measures for high wheat yields in mountainous areas have also been formulated.

### 山区小麦不能丰产吗

    山区小麦不能丰产吗
    本报记者　朱波
    几年来，陕西省小麦生产获得很大成绩。今年小麦面积比1949年扩大三百多万亩，亩产量从1950年的一百多斤，提高到二百多斤。但是小麦增产，主要在关中平原，这里亩产量由解放初期的几十斤提高到三百斤以上；而山区的麦田却不是这样，面积非常不固定，同时增产的速度很慢，在陕北有些县的麦田亩产仍在三、四十斤左右。
    什么原因使得山区小麦产量不能提高呢？
    从农业部门领导上来看，当全国解放初期，研究小麦丰产问题时，就确定以关中地区的麦田为重点（这是对的），但是，几年来一直忽视对山区小麦丰产的领导。当每次提出山区小麦丰产问题时，很多人的头脑里就出现了干燥的黄土高原、纵横的沟壑、重重叠叠的丘陵、多冰雹霜冻的自然条件等等。也有些人借口山区小麦面积小，麦田分散，轻视山区的小麦生产。很多人提到山区小麦丰产问题，就面带难色。因此，不管是在新农具、肥料的供应问题上，推广小麦良种问题上，领导上首先想到的是关中麦田，即便发一些指示，也常常从关中地区的情况出发，没有照顾到山区麦田的特点。
    这样一来，在山区，很多耕作新技术都没有推广。在关中，绝大部分麦田，都系统地采用了深耕、施肥、锄草、条播密植等新技术。在山区，上述一系列的新耕作技术则没有推广，绝大部分农民仍然采用旧的耕作技术，整地粗糙，采用混杂退化了的麦种，绝大部分麦田还是用撒播的方法，因此，小麦生长很坏，产量很低。
    山区小麦能不能丰产呢？回答应该是肯定的。问题在于领导部门如何发掘和创造山区小麦的丰产条件，并且具体地组织山区农民利用这些条件。
    在山区，小麦丰产的潜力是很大的。山区同样可以推广良种，增加肥料，条播密植，深耕保墒。陕北很多县的农业社早就进行过技术改革的尝试，在川地和山地的许多地方都进行过种植乌克兰小麦的实验，结果证明这个品种适合陕北自然条件，产量超过当地的土麦种30％—50％。延安县杨山农业社播种的乌克兰小麦，麦秆粗壮，麦穗肥大，每亩产量比延安土种麦高七十多斤。陕北有不少农业社也进行过小麦的条播密植试验，证明这也是提高山区小麦产量的主要措施。吴堡县白家湾农业社已往小麦的产量都在五、六十斤左右，今年它们采用了新的耕作技术，六亩丰产地里，每亩产麦在一百五十斤以上，高出全村小麦平均产量很多。陕北地区的小麦播种量，一般每亩只有五、六斤。现在，有很多农业社在小面积麦田上已经开始提高了播种量，并改点播、撒播为条播，由此可见这种改变也并不困难。
    许多事实证明山区的麦田是有条件进行技术改革的，提高小麦产量也是有把握的。今年山区实现了农业合作化，这更为山区小麦丰产提供了有利条件。当然在山区改进小麦种植技术并不是没有困难的，如山区农民住的分散，麦田不够集中，一个县的麦田，还不如关中地区的一个区的麦田多，因此，在组织技术学习等方面都有不便之处，但是，这些困难是可以克服的。
    目前，山区小麦丰产问题已经引起陕西省农业部门的重视，并且也制定出山区小麦丰产的技术措施。
