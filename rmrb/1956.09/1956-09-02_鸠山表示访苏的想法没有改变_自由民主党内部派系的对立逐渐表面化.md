Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, September 1st: Japanese Prime Minister Ichiro Hatoyama stated today that his idea of visiting the Soviet Union has not changed, unless there are definite signs indicating that this visit would not help break the deadlock in Japanese-Soviet negotiations.

　　Agriculture and Forestry Minister Ichiro Kono and Chief Cabinet Secretary Ryutaro Nemoto visited Ichiro Hatoyama, who is vacationing in Karuizawa, today to report on the disputes within the Liberal Democratic Party regarding issues such as Japanese-Soviet negotiations and cabinet reshuffle. Hatoyama reiterated his position of wanting to visit Moscow to them, and will make a final decision after Foreign Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu returns home and he has heard his detailed report. According to Kono, only some members of the former Yoshida faction and a few other individuals within the Liberal Democratic Party oppose Hatoyama's visit to the Soviet Union.

　　The renewed interruption of Japanese-Soviet negotiations has had a great impact on the Japanese political situation. The internal factional conflicts within the Liberal Democratic Party are gradually surfacing. On August 30th, Liberal Democratic Party Secretary-General Nobusuke Kishi publicly told reporters that if Hatoyama's visit to the Soviet Union were to materialize, there would inevitably have to be a temporary acting prime minister during Hatoyama's absence. Judging from the course of the Japanese-Soviet negotiations, it would be inappropriate for Deputy Prime Minister Shigemitsu to act as prime minister at that time. Kishi said that there was no other way but to ask Shigemitsu to withdraw from the cabinet.

　　At the same time, the leaders of the Liberal Democratic Party also dispatched former Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Sunao Sonoda, to San Francisco to explain the domestic political situation and party circumstances in detail to Mamoru Shigemitsu, who was on his way home. They hoped that Shigemitsu would consider the delicate domestic political situation, and that "the content should be cautious" when he reads his return statement at Tokyo Airport, and that he would "not express opinions that stimulate the political situation regarding the prospects of future Japanese-Soviet negotiations."

　　However, after meeting with Sunao Sonoda, Mamoru Shigemitsu announced at a press conference held in San Francisco on August 31st, "I have no intention of resigning. I don't think there is any reason to resign."

    鸠山表示访苏的想法没有改变
    自由民主党内部派系的对立逐渐表面化
    据新华社1日讯　东京消息：日本首相鸠山一郎今天表示，他的访问苏联的想法并没有改变，除非有确定的征候表明这次访问无助于打破日苏谈判的困境。
    农林相河野一郎和内阁官房长官根本龙太郎今天访问了在轻井泽休假的鸠山一郎，向他报告自由民主党内关于日苏谈判和内阁改组等问题的纷争。鸠山向他们重申了要访问莫斯科的立场，并且将在外务相重光葵回国并听取了他的详细报告以后，作出最后决定。据河野说，自由民主党内反对鸠山访问苏联的只是前吉田派的部分人士和其他个别人士。
    日苏谈判的再次中断，给日本政局很大冲击。自由民主党内部派系的对立逐渐表面化。自由民主党干事长岸信介8月30日公开向新闻记者说，如果鸠山访问苏联得以成行时，在鸠山出国期间势必要有一位临时代理首相。从日苏谈判经过看来，届时由副首相重光代理首相是不适当的。岸信介说，除了请重光退出内阁外没有别的办法。
    同时，自由民主党首脑并且派遣前外务省次官园田直赶往旧金山，向在回国途中的重光葵详细说明国内政局和党内情况。他们希望重光考虑国内微妙的政局，在到达东京机场宣读回国声明时，“内容要慎重些”，并且希望他“不要对今后的日苏谈判前景发表刺激政局的见解”。
    但是，重光葵在同园田直会谈后，在8月31日在旧金山举行的记者招待会上宣布，“我没有辞职的意思。我认为没有辞职的理由。”
