    A Milestone in Our Great Socialist Cause
    The Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China is scheduled to begin today. In the eleven years since the Seventh National Congress in 1945, our Party has led the Chinese people to complete the bourgeois democratic revolution, establish the People's Democratic Dictatorship of the People's Republic of China, and then immediately adopted peaceful means to implement the proletarian socialist revolution, giving our motherland a new face unprecedented in its history. Now, as our Party's Eighth National Congress opens, the socialist transformation of our agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce has achieved a comprehensive and decisive victory; the First Five-Year Plan has achieved great success in its implementation, and according to the current situation, it is estimated that this plan may be overfulfilled next year.
    Our Party has accumulated rich experience in leading the two revolutions and national construction. The Eighth National Congress, which opens today, will systematically summarize these experiences to guide our future work. We will more effectively mobilize and unite all positive factors inside and outside the Party to promote our great socialist cause. This congress will hear the political report of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party, discuss and decide on the policies and guidelines in all aspects of our country during the socialist construction period, discuss and adopt our Party's proposal on the Second Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy, discuss and adopt the revised Party Constitution, and elect the Eighth Central Committee of the Party.
    If the Seventh National Congress of the Party eleven years ago had prepared ideologically, politically, and organizationally for the victory of the Chinese revolution, then the Eighth National Congress, which opens today, will prepare ideologically, politically, and organizationally for the victory of our socialist construction. This congress will undoubtedly become a glorious milestone on our great historical road of building socialism.
    The practice of the Chinese revolution has proved that the political line of our Party Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong is the correct line of combining the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the actual situation of the Chinese revolution. Our Party, based on the characteristics of Chinese society and the special laws of revolutionary development, not only adopted a series of correct policies on armed struggle, revolutionary base areas, and peasant land issues during the bourgeois democratic revolution stage; but also adopted a series of correct policies suitable to the basic characteristics of our country's transition period after the proletarian socialist revolution began. We first developed the socialist economy and established its leading position in the entire national economy. Under the premise of consolidating the worker-peasant alliance, we gradually guided individual farmers onto the road of agricultural collectivization. We continued to adopt a broad united front policy towards the national bourgeoisie, absorbing their representatives to participate in the national regime; adopted a policy of utilization, restriction, gradual peaceful transformation, and finally gradual redemption to transform capitalist industry and commerce into socialist enterprises; and adopted a policy of persuasion, education, and ideological remolding towards bourgeois intellectuals, enabling them to voluntarily serve the great socialist cause; and adopted the policy of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision towards the various democratic parties. All of these are the result of our Party combining the general principles of Marxism-Leninism with the reality of the Chinese revolution. In the future, in all aspects of our country's socialist cause, we must continue to adhere to this correct line of combining the general principles of Marxism-Leninism with our country's reality.
    The correct line of the Party serves the highest interests of the working class and all working people. In the process of realizing the correct line of the Party, Party organizations at all levels and Party workers must patiently carry out propaganda, explanation, persuasion, and education work to the masses of the people, and should not be clever, subjective, or arbitrary. However, many of our comrades often make the mistake of subjectivism in their work. Sometimes they take one or two sentences they see in books, and make far-fetched connections and put forward propositions that are completely irrelevant and simply won't work. Sometimes they rely on a little successful experience they have encountered in previous work, and copy and forcibly promote it everywhere, resulting in setbacks everywhere and causing a lot of losses to the work. This subjective style of thinking is an obstacle on our road forward and must be resolutely eliminated.
    At present, in many of our organs and enterprises, the bureaucratic style of being divorced from the masses and reality is serious. Many leaders at higher levels often do not understand the opinions of their subordinates and the masses, and even suppress opinions from below, which seriously damages the enthusiasm of the broad masses. This is very detrimental to the socialist cause. However, the system of our Party and state is ultimately conducive to the struggle of the people against bureaucracy; bureaucrats will ultimately not find it easy here. In the future, Party organizations at all levels should further encourage the struggle against bureaucracy, and should advocate that every Communist Party member take the lead, consult with the masses in everything, earnestly listen to the opinions of the masses, and earnestly deal with the urgent problems raised by the masses in work and life. This will not only increase the enthusiasm of the broad masses for the socialist cause, but also further invigorate the democratic life of our country.
    In order to mobilize all positive factors to serve the socialist cause, we must also resolutely fight against all sectarian tendencies. We Communists must never regard the Party as a special and narrow sect outside of hundreds of millions of people. In the past, in order to carry out arduous revolutionary struggles, our Party had to unite all progressive forces of all strata in our country; now and in the future, in order to carry out huge socialist construction work, our Party must mobilize all positive factors among the 600 million people of our country. On this issue, the cooperation between our Communist Party members and non-Party democratic人士 is of considerable significance. Our Party regards the united front and Party building equally as magic weapons for defeating the enemy in the revolution, and also regards the united front and Party building equally as magic weapons for achieving victory in the great cause of socialist construction. As early as 1941, Comrade Mao Zedong declared: "The Communist Party's principle of democratic cooperation with people outside the Party is fixed and immutable and will never change." Recently, the Party Central Committee has repeatedly stated that the Communist Party must implement the policy of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision with other democratic parties; as long as the Communist Party exists, other democratic parties will also exist at the same time. This is beneficial to the entire socialist construction cause. On the one hand, this can strengthen the unity of the people of the whole country and strengthen the strength of building the motherland; on the other hand, this also has the effect of preventing subjectivism and bureaucracy.
    To build a socialist society in a large country like China with backward economy and culture, we must not only mobilize all positive factors among the 600 million people of the country, but also further unite the working class and progressive people of all countries in the world. Today, more than 40 delegations, representatives and observers from fraternal parties from all over the world are participating in our Party's National Congress. We warmly welcome them and sincerely thank them for their concern for our cause. Facts have long proved that without international support, it would be impossible for us to win the revolution and achieve construction success. Our Party has repeatedly taught all Party members: to fully develop the internationalist spirit of the working class, strengthen international unity, and resolutely oppose great-power chauvinism and bourgeois nationalist tendencies. We firmly believe that only "Workers of all countries, unite!" is the invincible great power. The wisdom and experience of Communist parties and working people in all countries of the world is what we should humbly learn. We must steadfastly learn from the valuable experience of revolutionary struggle and construction from various fraternal countries and fraternal parties headed by the Soviet Union. We must learn everything good and advanced in the world, so that we can have more and better conditions to build socialism.

### 我国伟大社会主义事业的里程碑

    我国伟大社会主义事业的里程碑
    中国共产党第八次全国代表大会定在今天开始举行。从1945年第七次全国代表大会以来的十一年间，我们的党领导中国人民完成了资产阶级民主性质的革命，建立了人民民主专政的中华人民共和国，并且紧接着又采取了和平的方式，实行了无产阶级社会主义性质的革命转变，使我们的祖国出现了自己历史上空前未有的新面貌。现在，当我们党的第八次全国代表大会开幕的时候，我国的农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造已经取得了全面的决定性的胜利；第一个五年计划在实施中已经得到巨大的成就，并且根据现在的情况来估计，这个计划有可能在明年超额完成。
    我们的党在领导两个革命和国家的建设事业中积累了丰富的经验。现在开幕的第八次代表大会，将系统地总结这些经验，用以指导我们今后的工作。我们将更有效地动员和团结党内外一切积极的因素，促进我国伟大的社会主义事业。这次大会将听取党的第七届中央委员会的政治报告，讨论和决定我国在社会主义建设时期各方面的政策方针，讨论和通过我们的党关于我国发展国民经济的第二个五年计划的建议，讨论和通过修改以后的党的章程，并且选举党的第八届中央委员会。
    如果说，十一年以前党的第七次全国代表大会曾经在思想上、政治上、组织上准备了中国革命的胜利，那么，现在开幕的第八次全国代表大会就将在思想上、政治上、组织上准备我国社会主义建设的胜利。这次大会无疑地将成为我们在建设社会主义的伟大历史道路上的一个光辉的里程碑。
    中国革命的实践证明，以毛泽东同志为首的我们党中央的政治路线是以马克思列宁主义的普遍真理同中国革命的实际相结合的正确路线。我们的党根据中国社会的特点和革命发展的特殊规律，不但在资产阶级民主革命阶段中，对于武装斗争、革命根据地和农民土地问题等等采取了一系列正确的政策；而且在无产阶级社会主义革命阶段开始以后，同样采取了适合于我国过渡时期基本特点的一系列正确的政策。我们首先发展社会主义的经济，确立了它在整个国民经济中的领导地位。在巩固工农联盟的前提之下，我们逐步地引导个体农民走上了农业合作化的道路。我们对民族资产阶级继续采取了广泛的统一战线政策，吸收他们的代表人物参加全国的政权；对资本主义工商业采取利用、限制、逐步地和平改造、最后使它们改变为社会主义企业的逐步赎买的政策；对资产阶级的知识分子也采取说服教育和思想改造的政策，使他们自愿地为伟大的社会主义事业服务；对于各个民主党派，采取长期共存、互相监督的方针。所有这些都是我们的党把马克思列宁主义的一般原理同中国革命的实际相结合的结果。在今后我国的社会主义事业的各个方面，我们还必须继续坚持马克思列宁主义的一般原理同我国的实际相结合的这个正确路线。
    正确的党的路线是服务于工人阶级和全体劳动人民的最高利益的。在实现党的正确路线的过程中，各级党的组织和党的工作人员必须耐心地向人民群众进行宣传解释和说服教育的工作，而不应该自作聪明，主观武断。可是，我们有许多同志在工作中却往往犯了主观主义的毛病。他们有时凭了自己从书本子上看到的一两句话，就牵强附会，提出主张，其实牛头不对马嘴，根本行不通。他们有时凭了自己以前工作中碰到的一点成功经验，就东搬西套，强迫推广，结果到处碰壁，使工作受到许多损失。这种主观主义的思想作风是我们前进道路上的一种障碍，必须坚决加以扫除。
    目前在我们的许多机关和企业中，脱离群众、脱离实际的官僚主义作风是严重的。许多上级领导人员往往不了解下级和群众的意见，甚至对于来自下面的意见横加压制，以致广大群众的积极性受到严重的伤害。这对于社会主义事业非常不利。但是，我们党和国家的制度毕竟是便利于人民群众反对官僚主义的斗争的；官僚主义者在这里终究是找不到便宜的。今后各级党的组织应该进一步鼓励反官僚主义的斗争，应该提倡每一个共产党员以身作则，遇事同群众商量，认真地倾听群众的意见，认真地处理群众在工作上和生活上提出的迫切问题。这样不但可以提高广大群众对社会主义事业的积极性，而且可以进一步活跃我们国家的民主生活。
    为了动员一切积极因素服务于社会主义事业，我们还要坚决向一切宗派主义的倾向作斗争。我们共产党员决不能把党当成是在几万万人之外的特殊的狭小的宗派。过去，为了进行艰苦的革命斗争，我们的党曾必须团结我国各阶层的一切进步力量；现在和今后，为了进行巨大的社会主义建设工作，我们的党更必须动员我国六万万人民群众中的一切积极因素。在这个问题上，我们共产党员同党外民主人士的合作是有相当重大意义的。我们的党把统一战线和党的建设同样看作是在革命中战胜敌人的法宝，也把统一战线和党的建设同样看作是在社会主义建设的伟大事业中取得胜利的法宝。早在1941年，毛泽东同志就曾经宣告：“共产党的这个同党外人士实行民主合作的原则，是固定不移的，是永远不变的。”最近，党中央一再说明共产党一定要实行同其他民主党派长期共存、互相监督的方针；只要共产党存在，其他民主党派也就同时存在。这对整个社会主义建设事业有好处。一方面，这样可以加强全国人民的团结，加强建设祖国的力量；另一方面，这样也有防止主观主义、官僚主义的作用。
    要在中国这样一个经济和文化落后的大国中建成社会主义社会，我们不但要动员全国六万万人民群众中的一切积极因素，而且要更进一步团结世界各国工人阶级和进步人民。今天，有世界各国兄弟党派来的四十多个代表团、代表和观察员参加我们党的全国代表大会。我们热烈地欢迎他们，并且衷心地感谢他们对我们事业的关心。事实早已证明，没有国际的支援，我们要使革命胜利和建设成功是不可能的。我们的党一再教导全体党员：要充分发挥工人阶级的国际主义精神，加强国际团结，坚决反对大国主义和资产阶级的民族主义倾向。我们坚决相信，只有“全世界无产者，联合起来”才是战无不胜的伟大力量。世界各国共产党和劳动人民的智慧和经验是我们应该虚心学习的。我们要坚定不移地学习以苏联为首的各个兄弟国家、兄弟党的革命斗争和建设的宝贵经验。世界上一切好的、先进的事物，我们都要学习，以便我们有更多更好的条件来建设社会主义。
