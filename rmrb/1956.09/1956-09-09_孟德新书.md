    "Mengde's New Book"
    Tang Tao
    A bad habit has long existed in academic circles: taking advantage of what's readily available.
    There's a story in "Romance of the Three Kingdoms": When Zhang Song went from Xichuan to Xudu to see Cao Cao, Yang Xiu, in order to boast about Cao Cao's talent and excuse his own lowly position, took out a book from a basket, consisting of thirteen chapters, all recording methods of warfare, called "Mengde's New Book." Zhang Song laughed upon seeing it, saying that this book was written by an anonymous person during the Warring States period, and that Cao Cao had plagiarized the writings of the ancients and claimed them as his own, which didn't make it a "new book" at all. To prove this, he recited it from beginning to end, word for word. When Cao Cao found out, he said: Could it be that the views of the ancients coincide with mine! He then ordered the book to be torn up and burned.
    The purpose of the story may be to illustrate Zhang Song's photographic memory, but "Mengde's New Book" has since become an age-old mystery.
    I don't want to pass judgment here and convict Cao Cao, but I want to point out that such a trend indeed exists in academic circles. Going into a bookstore, buying a book on political economy, and after flipping through a few pages, feeling a sense of déjà vu, then searching on the shelf and actually finding its "origin," turning out to be a paraphrase of certain chapters of the "Textbook of Political Economy" compiled by the Institute of Economics of the Soviet Academy of Sciences; reading an article discussing European literary trends, and after reading just two paragraphs, again feeling very familiar, then upon further examination, discovering that its "old home" is in Japan, a large abridgment of Homa Hisao's "On Modern European Literary Trends"; the most blatant being even the still popular works of domestic writers being treated as replicas, a book calling itself "research" turning out to be a direct copy and synthesis of similar articles written by another writer two years ago. Naturally, there is rehash, piecing together, and following the current, "completely accepting," different methods, but the means is one, and I can't help but be amazed by the "abilities" of these "Cao Cao's." However, they only learn the Cao Cao in quotation marks; as for the real Cao Cao, upon hearing Zhang Song's words, he immediately burned "Mengde's New Book," and they are far from reaching that kind of magnanimity.
    We also need a fire now, and its name is: independent thinking.
    Someone said: "The first person to say the Earth is round is clever, the second person to say the Earth is round is a fool." I don't entirely endorse this statement. If Galileo speaks the truth, then there is no fear of repeating him, but within the repetition there must be clarification, supplementation, and development, and this is called academic research. What we oppose is not thinking, and we demand that "Mengde's New Book" is indeed "new," and has a "Mengde." If, for fear of being a fool, one says that the Earth is square, triangular, or Wall Street is shaped like a long strip, so it can accommodate capitalists to make money, drink champagne, and play golf, then that is wild and absurd thinking, and wild and absurd thinking is not better than not thinking at all; it is certainly not "Mengde's New Book," but can only be found in the American publishing world: "Losing One's Mind Chapter Forty-One."
    Independent thinking is the fundamental spirit of doing scholarship, and the followers of "Cao Cao" should also learn to grasp this fire, from adhering to the truth to developing the truth. Although these people can still use "Great minds think alike" to defend themselves, their ancestor "Cao Cao" has already proved that this is nothing but deception.
    Academic works like "Mengde's New Book" really bring us too much fatigue; we need a new spirit and atmosphere!

    “孟德新书”
    唐弢
    学术界长期以来存在着一种坏风气：趁现成。
    “三国演义”里有个这样的故事：张松从西川到许都见曹操，杨修为了夸耀曹操的才能，替自己的屈居下寮解嘲，从筐中拿出一卷书，共十三篇，所记的都是用兵的方法，叫做“孟德新书”；张松看了却笑起来，说这部书乃是战国时无名氏所作，曹操剽窃古人著述，据为己有，算不得什么“新书”。为了证明这一点，他便从头至尾一字不差的背出来。曹操知道以后说道：莫非是古人的见解和我的相暗合！便吩咐把这部书扯碎烧掉了。
    故事的目的也许在说明张松的过目不忘，但“孟德新书”却从此成了一件千古的疑案。
    我并不想在这里断狱，坐实曹操的罪名，我要指出的是学术界的确存在着这样的风气。跑进书店，买一册关于政治经济学的书，翻了几页，便觉得似曾相识，从架上一找，却居然找到了它的“出身”，原来是苏联科学院经济研究所编订的“政治经济学教科书”某些章节的转述；读一篇谈欧洲文艺思潮的文章，刚看了两段，又仿佛十分面熟，再一翻检，原来它的“老家”在日本，这是本间久雄“欧洲近代文艺思潮论”的大段缩写；最露骨的是，连本国作家尚在流行的著作，也被当作依样葫芦，一部号称“研究”的书，却是两年前另一作家所写同类文章的照抄和综合。自然，这里面有改头换面，有东拼西凑，也有顺流而下，“照单全收”，方法不同，而手段则一，我不能不吃惊于这些“曹操”的“本领”。不过他们学的只是打引号的曹操，对于真的曹操，一听到张松的话，便立刻把“孟德新书”烧掉，却还远远地够不上这样的气度。
    我们现在也需要有一把火，它的名称是：独立思考。
    有人说：“第一个说地球圆的是聪敏人，第二个说地球圆的便是傻子。”我并不完全拥护这句话。如果加利略说的是真理，那就不怕重复他，但重复之中必须有阐明，有补充，有发展，这才叫做学术研究。我们反对的是不思不想，要求“孟德新书”的确“新”，而且有一个“孟德”。倘使为了怕做傻子，便说地球是方的，三角形的，或者华尔街似长条形的，因此容得下资本家在里面发财，喝香槟，打高尔夫球，那便是胡思乱想，而胡思乱想并不比不思不想更好些，它固然不是“孟德新书”，却是在美国出版界才能找到的：“发昏章第四十一”。
    独立思考是做学问的根本精神，“曹操”的信徒们也应该学学掌握这把火，从坚持真理到发展真理。虽然这些人还可以用“英雄所见略同”来替自己辩解，但他们的祖师爷“曹操”早已证明了，这不过是欺人之谈。
      “孟德新书”似的学术著作，实在带给我们以太多的疲倦了，我们需要有新的精神和风气！
