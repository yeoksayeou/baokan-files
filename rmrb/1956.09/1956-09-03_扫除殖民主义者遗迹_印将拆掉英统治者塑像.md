Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, September 2nd. Uttar Pradesh Deputy Minister of Education, Sita Ram, said at the Provincial Legislative Assembly on August 31st that statues of former British officials built in various cities of Uttar Pradesh during British rule would be demolished. He said the decision was made in accordance with the advice of the Indian government.

In order to respect the wishes of the people of Allahabad, the statues of Queen Victoria and King George V in Alfred Park in that city will be removed, and a statue of the famous Chandra Shekhar Azad will be erected in the same place. During British rule, Azad sacrificed himself in this park during a heroic struggle with the police.

The Calcutta municipal authorities are considering a proposal to rename Harrison Road, which connects the city's two railway stations, as Mahatma Gandhi Road. The Bengali-language newspaper "Freedom Daily" praised the proposal on August 31st and suggested that statues of former British rulers erected in the city's parks and public places during British rule also be removed.

    扫除殖民主义者遗迹
    印将拆掉英统治者塑像
    据新华社新德里2日电　北方省教育部副部长西塔·拉姆8月31日在省立法议会上说，英国统治时期在北方省各城市修建的前英国官员的塑像将被拆掉。他说，这项决定是遵照印度政府的建议作出的。
    为了尊重阿拉哈巴德人民的愿望，将把这个城的艾尔弗雷德公园里的维多利亚女王和英王乔治五世的塑像拆掉，而在同一地方把著名的钱德拉·希哈尔·阿扎德的塑像建立起来。在英国统治时期，阿扎德就是在这个公园同警察进行英勇斗争的时候牺牲的。
    加尔各答市行政机关正在考虑把连接这个城的两个火车站的哈里逊路改名为圣雄甘地路的建议。8月31日孟加拉文日报“自由报”赞扬这项建议，并且建议也拆掉英国统治时期在这个城市的公园和公共场所建立的前英国统治者的塑像。
