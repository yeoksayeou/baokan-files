Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, September 2nd. In order to ensure that the 73 million mu of wheat in Henan Province are planted quickly and well this winter, the state will supply farmers with 250 million jin of improved wheat seeds this year, an increase of about one and a half times compared to previous years.

Of these wheat seeds, more than 140 million jin are high-quality varieties purchased by the state through the grain departments at premium prices from farming households in wheat-abundant areas. The remaining portion is top-grade wheat selected by local grain departments in coordination with agricultural departments from national grain depots. Recently, these seeds have undergone multiple inspections and germination tests by relevant departments. The purity of the seeds is generally high, with a germination rate generally around 80%.

Furthermore, due to rain damage this year in Henan Province, the quality of wheat in many areas has decreased, making it unsuitable for seeds. Currently, local leading organs are convening working conferences of agricultural, grain, and transportation departments to arrange the mutual adjustment and supply of wheat seeds between special districts and counties. Xinxiang, Anyang, Luoyang, Kaifeng, and Nanyang special districts, in order to ensure that 46 million jin of wheat seeds to support farmers in the disaster areas of Xinyang and Xuchang are transported to their destinations before September 10th, have jointly established wheat seed transfer and transportation headquarters or working groups. In order to support Nanyang Special District, which has the largest wheat seed transportation task, in completing its seed transfer task early, the Provincial People's Committee has decided to transfer 140 transport vehicles from Xuchang to participate in the seed transportation work on the Xu-Nan Highway section.

    及早准备秋种
    河南供应农民大批麦种
    新华社郑州2日电　河南省为了使今冬七千三百万亩小麦种的又快又好，今年由国家供应农民的优良麦种将达二亿五千万斤，比往年约增加一倍半。
    这批麦种，其中有一亿四千多万斤是国家委托粮食部门在小麦丰收地区优价收购的农家优良品种；其余部分，是当前各地粮食部门配合农业部门从国家粮库中挑选出来的上等小麦。这些种籽，最近都经过有关部门作了多次检查与发芽试验，种籽的纯度大都很高，发芽率一般在80％上下。
    又讯　河南省今年因雨水危害，不少地区小麦质量降低，不宜作种。现在各地领导机关正召开农业、粮食和交通运输部门的工作会议，布置专区与专区、县与县的麦种互相调剂和供应工作。新乡、安阳、洛阳、开封和南阳等专区，为了保证在9月10日以前，把支援信阳、许昌灾区农民的四千六百万斤麦种运到目的地，各地都联合成立了麦种调运指挥部或工作组。省人民委员会为了支持这次麦种运输任务最大的南阳专区提早完成种籽外调任务，已经决定从许昌抽调一百四十辆运输汽车，参加许南公路段的种籽运输工作。
