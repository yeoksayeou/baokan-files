Xinhua News Agency, 28th. The breach at Ximag 각 Zhuang in Daxing County on the Yongding River has been closed on the 26th. On July 1st, after the Yongding River's North Embankment in the Ximag 각 Zhuang section of Daxing County breached due to riverbed erosion from floods, the Central Flood Control Headquarters and the Hebei Provincial Flood Control Headquarters, in order to ensure the safety of the Beijing-Shanhaiguan Railway and the vast rural areas, successively breached the road protection embankments at Yu Changfu, Dongjing, and Luofa in Anci County, guiding the river water into the Yongding River flood zone, allowing the water to return to the Yongding River. At the same time, all the gates of the Guanting Reservoir on the Yongding River were closed, controlling the downstream flow, and a river blocking weir was hastily built near Lugou Bridge, diverting the Yongding River water into the Xiaoxing River. This put the breach at Ximag 각 Zhuang in a basically water-free state for closure. Starting from the 16th, after more than 10,000 people worked for ten days to rush the closure, the 300-meter-wide breach was closed on the afternoon of the 26th.

    永定河西麻各庄决口已合龙
    新华社28日讯　永定河大兴县境内西麻各庄的决口已在26日合龙。7月1日，由于永定河北大堤在大兴县西麻各庄段内因河床被洪水冲刷溃堤决口以后，中央防汛总指挥部和河北省防汛总指挥部为了保障京山铁路和广大农村的安全，曾先后在安次县境内的于常甫、东京和落垡等处扒开护路大堤，导引河水入永定河泛区，使水归入永定河。同时，将永定河上的官厅水库闸门全部关闭，控制了下泄流量，并且在芦沟桥附近赶筑拦河埝，把永定河水引入小清河。这样就使西麻各庄决口处在基本无水的情况下堵口。自16日开始，经过一万多人十天的抢堵，三百公尺宽的决口已于26日下午合龙。
