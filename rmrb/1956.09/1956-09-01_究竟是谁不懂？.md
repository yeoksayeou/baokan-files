Who Exactly Doesn't Understand?
    Yiqun

    Zhang Ben, Deputy Director of the Production Technology Department of the Ministry of Textile Industry, had a problem she hadn't clarified when she worked in Shanghai in the past. The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI) had asked her to go to Shanghai several times to clarify the issue, but she hadn't gone due to other matters. This time, the CCDI instructed her to go again. Logically, she should have gone to the CCDI to get a letter of introduction. However, she didn't want to go because she thought it was too far, and insisted that the Party Branch of the Ministry of Textile Industry introduce her to the Party Committee of Central Government Departments, so that the Party Committee of Central Government Departments could write a letter introducing her to the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. Because this practice exceeded the scope of authority of the Party Committee of Central Government Departments, the Party Committee staff did not agree to write such a letter of introduction. Thus, the following "argument" occurred in the office of the Party Committee of Central Government Departments.

    "Comrade! This is an instruction from the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, and also a letter of introduction from the Party Branch. Yet you say you can't write a letter of introduction for me. This is absurd! I don't think you understand anything!" Comrade Zhang Ben criticized a staff member of the Party Committee with great anger. "Comrade! Are you a cadre of the Ministry of Textile Industry?" Before the Party Committee staff could finish speaking, Comrade Zhang Ben interrupted him: "Isn't it written clearly on the letter? Comrade Zhang Ben, Deputy Director of the Production Technology Department of the Ministry of Textile Industry, is me!" "Deputy Director Comrade! You must understand more than me. Any organization has its own scope of work and authority. The Party Committee of Central Government Departments cannot write such a letter of introduction to the Shanghai Municipal Committee. If it really is an instruction from the CCDI, then go to the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection to exchange for a letter of introduction." The Party Committee staff patiently explained. "I'm not going to the CCDI. Anyway, you have to write this letter of introduction for me. Isn't the letter from the Party Branch genuine? Doesn't the Party Committee believe the Party Branch and the lower-level organizations? You simply don't understand anything! I want to see your person in charge!" The female Deputy Director became even more agitated. "I am the person in charge. Comrade! It's not that we don't trust the lower-level organizations, but the Party Committee must play a supervisory and review role, and must not blindly copy and write based on the letters from lower-level organizations without principle. Otherwise, it would be irresponsible," the staff member said. "No! You have to issue it to me. You must issue it!" The female Deputy Director's anger grew even stronger. "I can't issue it to you. If I issue it to you, I will make a mistake," the staff member still insisted on principle. "Fine! If you don't issue it, you call the Party Branch and ask them why they wrote a letter of introduction asking me to come to the Party Committee! You simply don't understand anything, and you don't understand the situation after inquiring. It's truly typical bureaucratism, it's absurd!" The female Deputy Director was clearly enraged and made a series of criticisms against the Party Committee staff. Regardless of how angry the female Deputy Director was, the comrades of the Party Committee also felt that they should indeed call the Party Branch of the Ministry of Textile Industry to ask what exactly was going on. So, they patiently replied: "Please wait a moment. I'll call to ask, to avoid making a bureaucratic mistake." However, the phone could not be connected no matter what. "Please sit down for a moment. I can't get through." "Fine! If I can't get through on the phone, I'll go find your Minister and ask him why he won't issue this letter of introduction for me!" "Alright, please go ahead. The Minister's office is upstairs." But for some reason, the female Deputy Director took a few steps, but before she left the door, she walked back and said with a bit of sarcasm: "Alright! I'll make the phone call, so as not to delay your work." "Operator? Please connect me to Director Li's office... Director Li's office? ...I'm Zhang Ben, Deputy Director of the Production Technology Department. Please find Director Li to answer the phone... What, he's in a meeting? The meeting room is far from here? ...When will he finish the meeting? ...I don't know... I'm at the Party Committee right now... It's just that Director Li gave me a letter of introduction earlier asking me to come to the Party Committee, but this person in the Party Committee doesn't understand anything and won't exchange the letter of introduction for me... It's impossible to reason with him. It's terrible to encounter such a person... What? Let the Party Branch explain to him, alright!" "Hey! I can't even find anyone!" The female Deputy Director angrily put down the phone: "Are you going to issue it or not!" "Please wait a moment. I'll call the Party Branch again," the Party Committee comrade said. "Party Branch? I'm looking for Comrade Yu,... Comrade Yu? This is the Party Committee. Earlier, you wrote a letter of introduction asking the Party Committee to write a letter of introduction to Comrade Zhang Ben of the Production Technology Department to solve a problem in Shanghai, do you know? What is it all about, what kind of problem is it..." After the Party Branch of the Ministry of Textile Industry told the Party Committee staff the whole story, they especially explained that they originally did not agree to introduce Comrade Zhang Ben to the Party Committee of Central Government Departments, but because she insisted on having it written, they had no choice but to write it for her. Finally, they suggested: "It's better to ask Comrade Zhang Ben to go back and get the letter of introduction from the CCDI." Hearing the conversation between the Party Committee and the Party Branch on the phone becoming more and more unfavorable to her, the female Deputy Director quickly took the phone and said: "I'm Zhang Ben, are you Comrade Yu? I said that it's not appropriate to issue such a letter of introduction, and it's better to go to the CCDI. But now that I've come to the Party Committee, it's better to let the Party Committee write a letter of introduction... What, you're asking me to go back and then go to the CCDI? That won't do, I'm not going... What, the Party Committee can't write it... You have to make me go back," the female Deputy Director helplessly put down the phone and took the letter of introduction written by the Party Branch and quickly left the Party Committee office without even looking up.

    This Deputy Director repeatedly blamed others for not understanding anything, while she herself, of course, understands things much better. But what exactly does she understand? Does she understand the procedures for writing letters of introduction within the Party? Does she understand the Party's constant teaching of "avoiding arrogance and rashness, being modest and prudent"? Does she understand that the staff of the Party and the state should be loyal and honest and should not try to muddle through and be opportunistic? It seems not. The above series of dialogues is the most vivid and powerful proof.

    究竟是谁不懂？
    一群
    纺织工业部生产技术司副司长张本，过去在上海工作时，有个问题没弄清楚，中共中央监察委员会曾几次让她到上海去一趟，把问题弄清楚，她因有事一直未去。这次中监委又指示要她去一下。按理，她应该到中监委去拿介绍信，可是，她嫌路远不愿去，一定要纺织工业部党总支给她介绍到国家机关党委会去，让国家机关党委会写信介绍她到中共上海市委去。因为这种做法超出了国家机关党委会的职权范围，党委工作人员不同意写这样的介绍信。于是，在中央国家机关党委会的办公室里就发生了这样一番“争吵”。
      “同志！这是党中央监察委员会的指示，又是党总支写的介绍信，你却说不能给我写介绍信，岂有此理，我看你什么都不懂！”张本同志大发雷霆地批评着党委的一个工作人员。“同志！你是不是纺织工业部的干部？”还没等党委工作人员说完，张本同志就打断了他的话：“信上写的不是很清楚吗？纺织工业部生产技术司副司长张本同志就是我！”“副司长同志！你要比我懂得多，任何机关都有它一定的工作范围和权限。中央国家机关党委不能给上海市委写这样介绍信，如果真的是中监委给你的指示，你就到中央监委去换介绍信吧。”党委的工作人员耐心地解释着。“我才不去中监委呢。反正你得给我写这个介绍信。这信是总支写的，还有假的吗？难道党委就不相信总支和下边组织吗？你简直什么也不懂，找你们的负责同志！”女副司长更不冷静了。“就是我负责的。同志！不是不相信下级组织，而是党委要起监督和审查作用，决不能无原则地根据下级组织的信照抄照写，否则就是不负责任。”工作人员说。“不行！你得给我开，不给我开就不行。”女副司长的火气更大了。“不能给你开，给你开了我就会犯错误。”工作人员仍是坚持着原则。“好！不开，你给我打电话问问总支，它写介绍信叫我来党委干嘛的？你简直是什么都不懂，既不懂又不了解了解情况，真是典型的官僚主义，岂有此理。”女副司长显然怒不可遏了，对党委的工作人员提出了一连串的批评。不管女副司长怎样生气，党委的同志也觉得确实应该打电话问一下纺织工业部党总支究竟是怎么一回事，于是就耐心地回答：“请你等一下，我来打电话问问，免得犯官僚主义。”可是电话怎样也打不通，“请你坐一下，电话打不通。”“好！打不通电话，我去找你们部长，问他为什么不给我开这介绍信！”“好吧，请你去吧？部长在楼上办公。”但不知为什么女副司长走了几步，还没有出门，就又走回来带点讽刺地说：“好吧！我来打电话，免得耽误你们工作。”“总机吗？请接李主任办公室……李主任办公室吗？……我是生产技术司副司长张本，请你找一下李主任接电话……怎么，开会去了，会议室离这里很远？……他什么时候才开完会……不知道……我现在在党委……就是刚才李主任给我写的介绍信叫我来党委，可是党委这个人他什么也不懂得，却不给我换介绍信……给他讲不通的，真糟。怎么遇到这样一个人……什么？让总支给他讲，好吧！”“哎！人也找不到！”女副司长很生气地放下电话：“你开不开！”“请你再等一下，我再给总支打电话。”党委的同志说。“总支吗？我找于同志，……于同志吗？我是党委，刚才你们写来一个介绍信，请党委给生产技术司张本同志写一介绍信到上海解决一个问题，知道吗？是怎么一回事，去解决什么样的问题……”纺织工业部党总支把事情的原委告诉党委的工作人员以后，又特别说明原来他们就不同意介绍张本同志到国家机关党委会的，因为她非叫写不行，就只好给她写。最后又提出：“还是请张本同志回去，让她到中监委去取介绍信好了。”听见党委和总支的同志在电话里的交谈愈来愈对自己不利，女副司长赶紧接过电话来就说：“我是张本，你是于同志吗？我说开这样的介绍信不行，应该到中监委去才好，不过现在我已经来到党委了，还是让党委写一个介绍信好了。……怎么现在叫我回去再到中监委去？那不行，我不去……怎么党委不能写………非得让我回去，”女副司长无可奈何地放下电话机，就头也不抬的拿了总支写的介绍信飞快地离开了党委办公室。
    这位副司长口口声声责备别人简直什么也不懂，她自己当然是懂事得多了。可是她究竟懂得什么呢？她懂得党内写介绍信的手续吗？她懂得党经常教导的“戒骄戒躁，谦虚谨慎”吗？她懂得党和国家的工作人员应该忠诚老实不应该蒙混取巧吗？似乎并不，上面这一串对话就是最生动最有力的证明。
