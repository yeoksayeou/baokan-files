Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 7th: According to TASS, certain right-wing British newspapers are heavily touting the large-scale landing exercises conducted by Britain in Malta on September 6th, with French cruisers also participating. These newspapers openly link these exercises to the so-called "Suez Crisis." It is not difficult to see that this kind of saber-rattling tactic is in line with the position of certain British politicians. They have still not abandoned the futile attempt to use pressure and threats to achieve a solution to the Suez issue that is favorable to them.

However, the warmongering clamor of the advocates of arbitrary policies is being met with increasingly strong resistance from millions of ordinary British people and many social organizations. The resolution passed by the British Trades Union Congress annual meeting opposing the use of force against Egypt has been widely echoed, so much so that the right-wing "Daily Mail's" diplomatic commentator, Hay Eden, despairingly wrote that "the united opposition of the trade unions" may undermine British military preparations on the Suez issue.

Social figures with various different political views and religious beliefs have participated in the rising movement to protest political policies unfavorable to the resolution of the Suez issue. Donald Soper, a British Methodist, issued a statement on the Suez issue on September 7th. He said: "I believe that there are tens of thousands of Christians who oppose the use of force... The Church should convey the opinions of Christians to the government, as the British Trades Union Congress has done."

The influential "Manchester Guardian" pointed out in an editorial on September 7th that the British "government is hindering negotiations with its belligerent behavior..."

The bourgeois weekly "The Spectator" believes that Anglo-French military preparations only promote the deterioration of the international situation. This magazine opposes the use of force. It believes that such action would cause serious damage to Britain.

    英国舆论反对用武力威胁埃及
    新华社8日讯　据塔斯社伦敦7日讯：英国某些右翼报纸大事吹嘘英国9月6日在马耳他岛举行的、并有法国巡洋舰参加的大规模登陆演习。这些报纸公然把这次演习同所谓“苏彝士危机”联系起来。不难看出，这一类炫耀武力的策略是符合英国某些政治人士的立场的。他们直到现在还没有放弃以压力和威胁来在苏彝士问题上取得有利于他们的解决办法这个徒劳无益的企图。
    可是，专横政策拥护者的好战叫嚣受到千百万普通英国人和许多社会团体日益加强的反击。英国职工大会年会通过的反对对埃及使用武力的决议得到了广泛响应，以致右翼的“每日简报”的外交评论员海·艾登绝望地写道，“工会的一致反对”可能破坏英国在苏彝士问题上的军事准备。
    具有各种不同政治见解和宗教信仰的社会人士都参加了日益高涨的抗议不利于苏彝士问题解决的政治方针的运动。英国卫理公会人士唐纳德·索佩尔9月7日就苏彝士问题发表了一篇声明。他说：“我认为，有成千上万的基督教徒反对使用武力……教会应当像英国职工大会所做的那样，把基督教徒的意见转达给政府”。
    有影响的“曼彻斯特卫报”7日在社论中指出，英国“政府正在以自己好战的行为……阻挠谈判”。
    资产阶级的“旁观者”周刊认为，英法的军事准备只是促进了国际局势的恶化。这家杂志反对使用武力。它认为，这种行动会给英国带来严重损害。
