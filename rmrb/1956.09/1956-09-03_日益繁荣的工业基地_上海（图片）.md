A Thriving Industrial Base - Shanghai
Written by Ji Yin; Photos by Wang Chaozhen, Wang Zhiyuan, Lu Yongzhen, Zhao Liqun

Shanghai is one of the largest industrial bases along the coast of China. It boasts more than 26,000 factories of all sizes, and its total industrial output value accounts for approximately one-fifth of the nation's total industrial output value. The development of Shanghai's modern industry has experienced a tortuous path of more than a century. It was not until after liberation in 1949 that it achieved the highest speed of development in its history. From 1949 to this year, Shanghai's heavy industry output value will increase by 10.2 times, light industry will increase by 2.1 times, and the textile industry will increase by 1.3 times.

Shanghai, the industrial city of New China, has been working tirelessly for the interior and vast urban and rural areas of the motherland in recent years, obtaining industrial raw materials and agricultural products from there, and continuously sending a large number of light and heavy industrial products to the whole country. The industrial products produced in Shanghai, just like the 210,000 construction personnel sent out by Shanghai, have spread all over the country, whether it is at the oil drilling sites in the Qaidam Basin, the underground coal city on the edge of the Heilongjiang River, the steel heart of Anshan Iron and Steel, or the workshops of the new textile factories on the Longhai Railway... Shanghai's industrial products, and those smart and enthusiastic Shanghai workers, are welcomed everywhere. The people of the whole country love Shanghai, and Shanghai thanks the support of the people of the whole country.

Since the policy of "fully utilizing coastal industries" was put forward, it has begun to bring new prosperity to Shanghai, a coastal industrial city with infinite potential. At present, hundreds of heavy industrial factories in Shanghai are undergoing expansion and reconstruction, and many light industrial factories needed by the country are also expanding. The recent Shanghai First Party Congress and the Municipal People's Congress, based on the industrial policy of "full utilization and rational development," have made a long-term plan for Shanghai's industry. By the end of the Second Five-Year Plan period, Shanghai's total industrial output value will increase by 80% compared with the planned level in 1957, and by the end of the Third Five-Year Plan period, the total industrial output value will increase by another 49% (the above figures do not include the output value of handicrafts). In the future, Shanghai will become a base for domestic manufacturing of medium and small machinery, especially precision machinery and shipbuilding industry. Shanghai's light industry and textile industry will continuously improve technology and strive to increase the production of high-end products, so that Shanghai can send more and better high-end industrial products to domestic and foreign markets. In short, the future Shanghai will appear on the banks of the Yangtze River in the southeast of the motherland as an even stronger and more prosperous industrial base.

The people of Shanghai are working hard to realize this long-term plan.

　　Shanghai's smelting workers are working selflessly, smelting more and better steel to support national construction.

　　In the two photos above, the left one is the casting workshop of the Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant, which recently successfully trial-produced a new product - the "1-5-1" type locomotive main frame, which can be used to assemble a new type of locomotive with great traction and suitable for climbing slopes and running long distances. This frame is 10.945 meters long. The one on the right is the watch balance screw being made in the watch replication workshop of the Shanghai Second Light Industry Bureau's watch factory preparation office. More than 1,240 can be packed into this two-centimeter-long, six-and-a-half-millimeter-diameter round glass tube.

　　Shanghai Joint Public-Private Anda Cotton Mill No. 1 not only fully completed the state plan in the first half of this year, but also was rated as an advanced factory in the city's inter-factory competition. After learning the advanced experience of state-owned factories, the workers in the mill's weaving workshop greatly reduced the rate of defective cloth.

　　The Port of Shanghai not only welcomes a large number of machines and goods imported from abroad, but also has various goods and machines to be shipped out from here.

　　Over the past year, the Public-Private Joint Venture Dahua Instrument Factory has trained more than 80 technicians for Beijing, Luoyang, Harbin, and other places. These students, who just stepped out of school a year ago, have now reached the level of third-grade technicians.

　　The state-owned Shanghai Refinery is actively adopting new technologies and equipment. After the oil refining equipment in the distillation and cracking workshops was improved, the oil refining volume increased by 40%-50% compared to last year. This is the exterior view of the distillation workshop after the equipment was improved.

　　The Shanghai Wire Factory has manufactured a large number of various cables and wires to support the construction projects of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, Anshan Iron and Steel, and the Tractor Factory. This batch of newly produced cables is about to leave the factory.

　　The British Red Hand and Leaf Brand bottom paints are world-renowned, but the quality of the Guangming Brand bottom paint trial-produced by the Shanghai Kailin Paint Factory is even better. This technician is conducting an anti-corrosion performance test of the bottom paint in the factory's artificial sea.

　　The electroceramic laboratory of the Institute of Metallurgy and Ceramics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences is using a stress determination furnace to determine the stress between the porcelain body and the glaze. This research work can improve the performance of electroceramic insulation materials, which is of great significance to high-voltage transmission lines and the electrical manufacturing industry.

　　The Shanghai Shipbuilding College has been established, which is the first new-type shipbuilding industrial college in the country.

    日益繁荣的工业基地——上海
    季音著文　王朝桢　王志渊　陆永桢　赵立群摄影
    上海是我国沿海最大的工业基地之一。它拥有着二万六千多户大大小小的工厂，它的工业总产值约占全国工业总产值的五分之一。上海的现代工业的发展，已经历了一百多年曲曲折折的道路。直到1949年解放之后，它才得到了有史以来最高速度的发展，从1949年到今年，上海的重工业产值将增长十点二倍，轻工业将增长二点一倍，纺织工业将增长一点三倍。
    上海，这座新中国的工业城市，几年来它面向着祖国的内地和广大城乡，一息不停地劳动着，从那里获取了工业原料和农产品，又源源不断地把大量的轻、重工业品送往全国。上海生产的工业品正如上海输送出去的二十一万建设人材一样，已经走遍了全国各地，无论在柴达木盆地的石油钻井工地上，在黑龙江边的地下煤城，在钢铁心脏鞍钢，在陇海路上新纺织厂的车间里，……上海的工业品，和那些聪明而热情蓬勃的上海工人，到处都受到欢迎。全国人民热爱上海，上海感谢全国人民的支援。
    “充分利用沿海工业”的方针提出以后，它已经开始给上海这座蕴藏着无穷潜力的沿海工业城市，带来了新的繁荣。现在，上海正有成百个重工业工厂在进行扩建和改建，许多为国家所需要的轻工业工厂也在扩大中，最近召开的上海第一次党代表大会和市人民代表大会会议，根据“充分利用、合理发展”的工业方针，已经对上海工业作了一个远景规划，到第二个五年计划期末，上海工业总产值比1957年计划水平将增长80％，在第三个五年计划期末，工业总产值将再增长49％（以上均不包括手工业的产值在内）。将来，上海要成为国内制造中、小型机械，特别是精密机械和造船工业的基地，上海的轻工业和纺织工业将不断提高技术，努力增产高级产品，让上海有更多更好的高级工业品送到国内外市场。总之，将来的上海将以一个更加强大、更加繁荣的工业基地的姿态，出现在祖国东南的长江边上。
    上海人民正在为实现这个远景规划而努力。
  　上海的冶炼工人们正在忘我地劳动，炼出更多、更好的钢支援国家建设。
  　上面两张照片里，左面的是上海第三钢厂铸造车间，最近试制成功了一种新产品——“1—5—1”型机车主车架，可用来装配一种牵引力很大，而又适宜爬坡和跑长距离的新型机车。这种车架体长十点九四五公尺。右面的是在上海市第二轻工业局手表工厂筹备处手表复制工场里制作的手表托子螺丝，在这二公分长、直径六个半公厘的圆玻璃管里能装一千二百四十多个。
  　上海公私合营安达棉纺一厂，今年上半年不但全面完成了国家计划，而且在全市厂际竞赛中又被评选为先进厂。该厂布机车间工人学习了国营厂的先进经验后，次布率大大降低了。
  　上海港不仅迎接着从国外进口的大量机器和商品，而且还有各种商品和机器要从这里运出去。
  　公私合营大华仪表厂一年来为北京、洛阳、哈尔滨等地培养了八十多名技术工人。这几个一年前刚跨出学校大门的学生，现在都已达到三级技工水平了。
  　国营上海炼油厂正在积极采用新的技术装备。蒸馏和裂化车间的炼油设备改进后，炼油量比去年提高40％—50％。这是改进设备后的蒸馏车间外景。
  　上海电线厂制造了大批各种电缆电线支援第一汽车制造厂、鞍钢、拖拉机厂等建设工程。这一批新生产出来的电缆又要出厂了。
  　英国红手牌、叶子牌船底漆世界闻名，可是上海开林油漆厂试制成的光明牌船底漆的质量比它还要好。这个技术人员正在厂里的人造海内作船底漆的防腐性能试验。
  　中国科学院冶金陶瓷研究所电瓷实验室正在运用应力测定炉来测定瓷坯和釉之间的应力。这项研究工作可以改进电瓷绝缘材料的性能，对高压输电线路以及电器制造工业上有十分重要的意义。　
    上海造船学院已经成立，这是全国第一座新型的造船工业高等学校。
