    Strive for a Greater Harvest Next Year on the Basis of This Year's Bumper Wheat Harvest
    Various Regions Actively Prepare for Sowing Winter Wheat
    (Our Newspaper) This newspaper reports: In order to strive for an even greater wheat harvest in 1957, various regions are currently actively preparing to sow winter wheat well.
    Although some areas suffered from rain damage and others from stem rust during the 1956 wheat harvest season, the overall harvest nationwide was historically unprecedented. The total national wheat output reached over 50 billion jin, exceeding the wheat production increase target set by the First Five-Year Plan.
    The biggest characteristic of this year's bumper wheat harvest is that high yields of over a thousand jin per mu and large-scale bumper harvests have emerged in the south, north, winter wheat areas, spring wheat areas, drylands, paddy fields, mountainous areas, and saline-alkali lands. According to incomplete statistics, more than 50 agricultural cooperatives in Shanxi, Shaanxi, Gansu, Henan, Hebei, Shandong, Hubei, and other provinces have achieved yields of over a thousand jin per mu for their bumper wheat crops. The Baofeng Agricultural Cooperative in Yongning County, Gansu Province, achieved a yield of a thousand jin per mu on 30 mu of saline-alkali land; the Xinlian Agricultural Cooperative at the foot of the Helan Mountains in a drought-prone area achieved an average yield of 1,100 jin per mu on 15 mu of wheat; the Zhu Jiajian Cooperative in Jingchuan County achieved a yield of 1,168 jin per mu on 2.8 mu of mountainous wheat; and the Shengli Cooperative in Xinjiang County, Shanxi Province, achieved a yield as high as 1,339.5 jin per mu on 1.3 mu of paddy wheat. Large-scale bumper harvests of over ten thousand mu are not isolated cases nationwide. This year, the 3.4 million mu of wheat sown in the Hexi Corridor of Gansu Province achieved an average yield of over 359 jin per mu. The four counties and cities of Zhangye, Linze, Linxia, and Wuzhong achieved an average yield of over 500 jin per mu. The Liangjiadun Township in Zhangye County achieved an average yield of 658 jin per mu on over 12,000 mu of wheat, and the Xianfeng Advanced Cooperative achieved an average yield of 801 jin per mu on over 1,500 mu of wheat. This is the first great victory in agricultural production since agricultural cooperation, and it has also given people confidence in further increasing wheat production.
    In order to strive for an even greater wheat harvest in 1957, various regions are currently actively carrying out various preparatory tasks before wheat sowing. Shanxi Province specifically convened a wheat production increase meeting and also invited cadres from agricultural cooperatives that have created new records of large-scale and high-yield wheat production to exchange experiences in increasing wheat production this year and specifically formulated a wheat production increase plan for 1957. Henan, Shandong, and other provinces have also convened meetings on the promotion of wheat production increase technologies. The Yan'an Special District and various counties in Shaanxi Province have established wheat sowing headquarters, formulated winter wheat sowing plans and technical operating procedures, and summarized and promoted local wheat production increase experiences. Based on this year's bumper harvest experiences, various regions have conscientiously promoted yield-increasing technologies. The first step is to regulate and popularize improved varieties. The Jinan Special District of Shanxi Province has already prepared over 160 million jin of various high-quality wheat seeds, which can basically be popularized throughout the district. Shandong Province transported 6.5 million jin of Bima No. 1 improved wheat seeds from Shaanxi Province, and all of them had been transported to agricultural production cooperatives in the five special districts of Linyi, Jining, Tai'an, Changwei, and Huimin by mid-August. The Shangqiu Special District in Henan Province has already reserved 14 million jin of wheat seeds for various regions to call upon. Anhui and Jiangsu provinces, which are more affected by disasters and lack seeds, have also negotiated with Sichuan, Shaanxi, Henan, Hubei, and other provinces to import over 400 million jin of improved varieties such as "Nanda 2419" and Bima No. 1, which are suitable for the local environment.
    As for wheat field base fertilizer, various regions have begun to pay attention to accumulating it after the wheat harvest. According to statistics from the Jinan Special District of Shanxi Province, the prepared fertilizer can be applied to 40% of the planned wheat acreage. The 528 youth shock teams in Yongji County accumulated over 1.1 million carts of various fertilizers in two months, which is enough for the base fertilizer of over 60% of the county's wheat fields. However, the amount of fertilizer already accumulated is still far from the amount needed for wheat fields, and various regions are still carrying out a concentrated rush to accumulate it.
    In order to do a good job in land preparation and moisture conservation, ensure timely sowing, and improve sowing quality, the wheat land that should be cultivated in Shanxi Province has basically been cultivated once, and some wheat land has also undergone a second deep plowing. In the Yan'an Special District of Shaanxi Province, wheat land has generally been plowed for the first time. In Luochuan County, 70% of the wheat land was deeply plowed with double-wheeled double-shared plows. In promoting close planting of wheat, in addition to supplying a large number of new-style seeders, various regions are also vigorously organizing hoe modification work. The Yan'an Special District of Shaanxi Province transferred 20 carpenters with high technical skills to manufacture 40 narrow-row strip seeding hoes, which were distributed to various counties for imitation and promotion. People were also drawn together for centralized training to learn from the experience of narrow-row strip seeding close planting.

### 在今年小麦丰收的基础上争取明年更大的丰收  各地积极准备播种冬小麦

    在今年小麦丰收的基础上争取明年更大的丰收
    各地积极准备播种冬小麦
    本报讯　为了争取1957年小麦更大的丰收，目前各地正在为种好冬麦积极进行准备。
    1956年麦收季节虽然有的地区遭受雨害，有的地区杆锈病为害，但从全国总的收成来看，仍获得了历史上空前的丰收。全国小麦总产量达到五百亿斤以上，超额完成了第一个五年计划所规定的小麦增产任务。
    今年小麦丰收最大的特点是：无论南方，北方，冬麦、春麦、旱地、水地，山地或盐碱地，都出现了千斤丰产和大面积丰收。据目前不完全统计，山西、陕西、甘肃、河南、河北、山东、湖北等省，共有五十多个农业社的丰产小麦，亩产在千斤以上。甘肃永宁县宝丰农业社在盐碱地上创造了三十亩千斤小麦，干旱地区的贺兰山脚下的新联农业社，有十五亩小麦平均亩产一千一百斤；泾川县朱家涧社的二亩八分山地小麦，亩产达到一千一百六十八斤；山西省新绛县胜利社有一亩三分水地小麦，亩产高达一千三百三十九斤半。上万亩的大面积丰产在全国也不是个别的。甘肃省河西走廊今年共播种的三百四十多万亩小麦，每亩平均产量达到三百五十九斤以上，张掖、临泽、临夏、吴忠四县市每亩平均产量达到五百斤以上，张掖县梁家墩乡一万二千多亩小麦，平均亩产六百五十八斤，先锋高级社的一千五百多亩小麦，平均亩产八百零一斤。这是农业合作化以后在农业生产上的第一个大胜利，也给人们带来进一步提高小麦产量的信心。
    为了争取1957年小麦更大的丰收，目前各地正在积极进行种麦前的各项准备工作。山西省专门召开了小麦增产会议，还邀请了创造小麦大面积和高额丰产新纪录的农业社干部，交流今年小麦增产的经验，具体制定了1957年小麦增产方案。河南、山东等省也召开了有关推广小麦增产技术的会议。陕西省延安专区和各县成立了小麦播种指挥部，制定冬麦播种计划和技术操作规程，并总结推广当地的小麦增产经验。根据今年的丰产经验，各地都认真推广了增产技术。首先是调剂和普及良种，山西晋南专区已经备妥各种小麦优种一亿六千多万斤，全区可以基本普及；山东省由陕西省调运的碧玛一号小麦良种六百五十万斤，到8月中已全部运到临沂、济宁、泰安、昌潍、惠民五个专区的农业生产合作社；河南省商丘专区已储备麦种一千四百万斤，供各地调用；受灾缺种较多的安徽、江苏两省，也已与四川、陕西、河南、湖北等省商定，调入适合当地环境的良种“南大二四一九”和碧玛一号等四亿多斤。
    麦田基肥，各地在麦收以后就开始注意积攒，据山西晋南专区的统计，已备妥的肥料可施计划种麦面积的40％，永济县的五百二十八个青年突击队，两个月积攒各种肥料一百一十多万车，足够全县60％以上麦田基肥之用。但已经积肥的数量与麦田需要的数量相差还很远，各地尚在突击抢积中。
    为了做好整地保墒，保证适时播种和提高播种质量，山西全省应耕的麦地已经基本上耕完一遍，部分麦地还进行了第二次深翻；陕西延安专区麦地普遍翻耘了头次，洛川县70％的麦地是用双轮双铧犁深耕的。各地在推行小麦密植方面，除了大量供应新式播种机外，还在大力组织改耧工作，陕西延安专区抽调技术较高的二十名木匠制造了窄行条播耧四十张，分发到各县仿照推广。并抽人集中训练，学习窄行条播密植经验。
