    Old Man Li was Moved to Tears
    It had been raining heavily for several days. The house of Li Guirong, a member of the Xianfeng Agricultural Cooperative in Nanshangle Township, Fangshan County, Hebei Province, was already leaking, and mud was constantly falling on the kang (a heated brick bed). Old Man Li Guirong and his wife were anxiously pacing back and forth. Looking out the door, the sky and the earth were a vast expanse of white, and they really didn't know what to do! At this critical moment, two young men, as wet as drowned chickens, suddenly barged in. Panting, they asked, "Uncle Li, is the house still habitable?" Li Guirong looked closely and recognized them as the production team leader, Wen Ze, and Xue Fengqi. Old Man Li was so excited that he didn't know what to say. Before Old Man Li could reply, they busily said, "Oh dear! The house is leaking so badly. Let's go! Hurry!" The two young men quickly draped sacks over the old couple, carried them on their backs, and left. They struggled through the uneven streets, almost slipping several times, but they finally carried the old people to the home of the production team leader, Wen Ze.
    After settling the two old people on the kang, they didn't even have time to catch their breath before rushing back to rescue the old people's belongings from their house, regardless of the danger. Many other cooperative members also rushed to help upon hearing the news. When everyone had almost finished moving everything out, leaving only a water vat, there was a sudden "crash," and the entire roof collapsed!
    After hearing the news of the house collapsing, Old Man Li Guirong and his wife were filled with a mixture of surprise and joy, and they shed tears of gratitude. They tightly grasped Wen Ze's hands and said, "If it weren't for all of you, we would have been finished along with the dilapidated house!" Wen Ze said, "The agricultural cooperative is a big family; we should help each other when there are difficulties. Helping the elderly is even more what we should do."

    李老汉感动得流了泪
    暴雨，连续下了好几天。河北省房山县南尚乐乡先锋农业社社员李桂荣的屋子，已经滴滴答答地漏水了，泥块也不断地掉在炕上。李桂荣老俩口，急得直打转。向门外望望，天地连成茫茫一片，真不知怎么办才好！就在这个紧要关头，忽然有两个湿的像落汤鸡一样的小伙子闯了进来。他们喘气呼呼地问道：“李大伯：屋子还能住吗？”李桂荣定神一看，原来是生产队长温泽和薛凤岐。李老头激动的不知说什么是好。还没等到李老头回话，他们就忙说：“唉呀！屋子都漏成这个样子啦，走！快走！”两个年轻人迅速地给老俩口披上了口袋，背起来就走。他们在坑洼不平的街道上吃力地走着，有几次都险些滑倒，但他们终于把老人背到了生产队长温泽的家中。
    他们在把两位老人安排在炕头上后，还没有来得及喘口气，就又不顾一切的奔去给老人家从屋里往外抢救东西，许多社员也闻声赶来帮忙。当大家抢运到只剩一口缸时，突然“哗啦”一声巨响，整个屋顶倒塌下来了！
    李桂荣老俩口听到房子倒塌的消息后，真是惊喜交集，感激得流下了眼泪。他们紧紧地抓住温泽的手说：“要不是你们大伙，我们俩早跟破房子一块完了！”温泽说：“农业社是个大家庭，有困难要互相帮助。帮助老年人，更是我们应当做的事。”
