    Military Exercises for Whose Benefit?

    The navies and air forces of five countries of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) – the United States, Britain, Australia, New Zealand, and Pakistan – began exercises on September 26 in the South China Sea. It is said that this is the first phase of the so-called "Albatross Exercise," which will last until October 22. In the subsequent phases, the exercise will expand to the Java Sea and the Gulf of Siam. This military aggression group boasts that this is the "largest exercise" held on these seas since the end of World War II.

    The holding of this exercise was decided at the SEATO military advisors' meeting held in Baguio, Philippines, in early September. The meeting also decided to hold a series of military exercises by May 1957. According to the New Zealand representative who attended the meeting, these exercises were intended to "demonstrate that the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization can unite and do something to show the communists."

    The fact that the planners of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization need to use military exercises to prove that the group "can unite" precisely proves that the "unity" within the group has become a problem. Otherwise, Stuop, the head of the US delegation, would not have shouted at the meeting: "Neutralism has no place in this world today." Stuop's words were obviously addressed to the Asian countries participating in this group. Among these countries, a tendency towards peaceful neutrality has become increasingly apparent recently, which is something that the US ruling group is very annoyed about. Therefore, the so-called military exercises "to show the communists" are actually aimed at these Asian countries, attempting to use the collective military demonstration of imperialism to intimidate these countries and force them to continue to follow the war policies of the United States.

    However, the purpose of the United States is not limited to this. At a time when almost all Asian countries are supporting Egypt on the Suez Canal issue, the US's planning of such a long-term military exercise and expanding the exercise area to the Java Sea near Indonesia is clearly an attempt to put pressure on the people of Asia, especially the people of Indonesia who insist on national independence and oppose colonialism, by creating tension in Asia.

    The imperialists have decayed to the point of losing their basic memory. They seem to have forgotten the failure that their outdated "gunboat policy" just suffered in Egypt. The awakened Asian people will not be afraid of anyone showing them their "teeth." On the contrary, those who like to show their "teeth" should seriously remember that one day, the Asian people will completely pull out these poisonous teeth.

### 给谁看的军事演习？

    给谁看的军事演习？
    东南亚条约集团的五个国家——美国、英国、澳大利亚、新西兰和巴基斯坦的海空军，从9月26日开始，在南中国海面上举行演习。据说，这是将要延续到10月22日的所谓“信天翁演习”的第一阶段。在随后的阶段中，这次演习将扩大到爪哇海和暹罗湾。这个军事侵略集团自己吹嘘说，这是二次大战结束以来在这些海面上举行的“最大的演习”。
    这次演习的举行，是9月初在菲律宾的碧瑶召开的东南亚条约集团军事顾问会议所决定的，这个会议并且决定到1957年5月为止，还要举行一系列的军事演习。据参加会议的新西兰代表说，这些演习是为了“证明东南亚条约组织能够团结一致，可以做些事情给共产党人看看”。
    东南亚集团的策划者们需要用军事演习来证明这个集团“能够团结一致”，恰恰证明了这个集团内部的“团结一致”成了问题。要不然，美国代表团团长斯图普就用不着在会上大叫大嚷：“中立主义今天在这个世界上是无立足之地的。”斯图普这种话显然是说给参加这个集团的亚洲国家听的。在这些国家中，最近越来越明显地出现了和平中立的趋向，这是美国统治集团感到十分恼火的事情。因此所谓“给共产党人看看”的军事演习，实际上是给这些亚洲国家看的，企图用帝国主义的集体军事示威来恫吓这些国家，迫使它们继续追随美国的战争政策。
    可是，美国的目的不尽如此。在几乎所有亚洲国家都在苏伊士运河问题上支持埃及的时候，美国策划这样长时期的军事演习，并且把演习地区扩大到印度尼西亚附近的爪哇海，显然企图用在亚洲制造紧张气氛的办法，对亚洲人民施加压力，特别是对坚持民族独立和反对殖民主义的印度尼西亚人民施加压力。
    帝国主义者们已经衰朽到丧失了起码的记忆力，它们似乎已经忘记了它们过时了的“炮舰政策”在埃及刚刚遭受到的失败。站起来了的亚洲人民是不会害怕任何人对他们露出来的“牙齿”的。倒是那些喜欢显示“牙齿”的人应该认真记住，终有一天，亚洲人民会把它们的这些毒牙完全拔掉。
