    Rewarding Supervision
    The bonuses of industrial and mining enterprises should originally be used to reward advanced producers. Only by rewarding the advanced, establishing banners, can the advanced become even more advanced, and drive the backward to catch up with the advanced.
    The leaders of the Zunyi Match Factory in Guizhou Province, however, came up with a strange reward method: anyone who discovers that other workers have produced defective products can be rewarded. It is said that implementing this reward method can improve product quality and eliminate defective products.
    In fact, even if this method can reduce defective products due to mutual supervision among workers, it cannot encourage workers to improve their skills and completely eliminate defective products. The reason is that it does not fundamentally solve the problem.

    监督得奖
    工矿企业的奖金，本来应该用来奖励先进生产者。只有奖励先进，树立旗帜，才能使先进的更先进，并且带动落后的赶上先进的。
    贵州省遵义火柴厂的领导人员，却想出了一种奇怪的奖励办法：凡是发现别的工人出了废品的人，就可以得到奖励。据说，实行这种奖励办法，可以提高产品质量，消灭废品。
    实际上，这种办法，即使因工人彼此监督，能使废品有所减少，但是并不能鼓励工人提高技术，彻底消灭废品。原因是没有从根本上去解决问题。
