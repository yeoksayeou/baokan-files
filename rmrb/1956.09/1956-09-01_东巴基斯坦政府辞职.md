Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, August 31st. The United Front government of East Pakistan Province submitted its resignation to the Governor of East Pakistan Province, Haq, last night.

The decision to resign was made by the United Front parliamentary party on August 29th.

Pakistani Prime Minister Ali had requested the Chief Minister of the East Pakistan provincial government, Sarkar, the leader of the United Front, to obtain a vote of confidence from the Provincial Legislative Assembly before August 31st. However, the United Front government, seeing that it could not guarantee the support of a majority of members in the Provincial Legislative Assembly, decided to resign.

The Sarkar cabinet was formed in June 1955. The Sarkar cabinet has been criticized by the opposition party and public opinion for failing to solve the problems facing East Pakistan and for not fulfilling the United Front's campaign promises.

    东巴基斯坦政府辞职
    据新华社喀喇蚩31日电　东巴基斯坦省的联合阵线政府昨晚向东巴基斯坦省长哈克提出了辞呈。
    辞职的决定是联合阵线议会党团在8月29日作出的。
    巴基斯坦总理阿里曾经要求东巴基斯坦省政府首席部长、联合阵线领袖萨卡尔在8月31日以前得到省立法会议的信任票。但是，联合阵线政府看到无法保证在省立法会议中取得多数议员的支持，于是决定辞职。
    萨卡尔内阁是在1955年6月间组成的。由于未能解决东巴基斯坦面临的问题，并且没有履行联合阵线的竞选诺言，萨卡尔内阁一直遭到反对党和舆论的抨击。
