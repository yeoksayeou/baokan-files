Shenyang, 29th (This newspaper dispatch) – The mechanical industry in Shenyang is accelerating its technical transformation. From the beginning of the year to early August, the various mechanical factories have installed 6,271 new pieces of equipment (excluding non-standard equipment).

　　Shenyang Mining Machinery Factory installed adjustment equipment in the forging workshop, and is now producing on an assembly line basis; the ground furnaces in the forging workshop have also been converted into reverberatory furnaces; the electric furnace capacity in the cast steel workshop has also been doubled, and some workshops have added some major equipment. After two years of technical transformation, the factory's output will increase by more than two times compared to 1955. The technical transformation work of the Shenyang No. 3 Machine Tool Factory is also being accelerated. The machine tools produced by this factory in 1957 will increase by one to two times compared to 1955.

　　After two years of technical transformation, the fifteen factories in Shenyang under the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry alone will increase their output by one to two times compared to 1955, and will be in a position to produce many new products, and labor productivity can be increased by more than one time.

　　The technical transformation of these factories is being carried out in the spirit of low investment, high returns, and fully utilizing the potential of existing enterprises. After the Shenyang No. 2 Machine Tool Factory completes its entire transformation plan, its output can be increased by four times compared to the estimated figure for 1956, but the investment in technical transformation can be recovered in the profits from increased production in about a year.

    沈阳各机械工厂进行技术改造
    七个多月安装六千多台设备
    本报沈阳29日电　沈阳市机械工业正加紧进行技术改造。从年初到8月上旬止，各机械工厂已安装了六千二百七十一台新设备（非标准设备还不在内）。
    沈阳矿山机器厂在锻工车间安装了调整设备装置，目前已按流水线进行生产；锻工车间的地炉也改装成反射炉；铸钢车间的电炉容积也扩大了一倍，有些车间增添了一些主要设备。这个工厂经过两年的技术改造后，产量将比1955年提高两倍多。沈阳第三机床厂的技术改造工作也在加紧进行。这个工厂生产的机床到1957年要比1955年增多一倍到两倍。
    仅第一机械工业部在沈阳的十五个工厂经过两年的技术改造后，产量将比1955年增加一倍到两倍，并将有条件生产许多新产品，劳动生产率可提高一倍以上。
    这些工厂的技术改造是本着投资少、收益大和充分发挥现有企业潜力的精神进行的。沈阳第二机床厂实现整个改造计划之后，产量可比1956年预计完成的数字提高四倍，但技术改造的投资，大约在一年多的时间内，就可以在增加产量的利润中收回。
