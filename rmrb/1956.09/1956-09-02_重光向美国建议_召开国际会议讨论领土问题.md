Xinhua News Agency, New York, September 1st: According to a report in the "New York Herald Tribune" on August 31st, Japanese Foreign Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu has made an "informal" suggestion to the U.S. government to convene an international conference with the participation of the forty-nine signatory nations of the San Francisco Peace Treaty to discuss the issue of southern Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands.

According to international agreements, these islands belong to the Soviet Union. However, Japan has insisted that the Soviet Union cede these territories in the Soviet-Japanese negotiations, leading to the breakdown of the talks.

The "New York Herald Tribune" revealed that Shigemitsu's suggestion is intended to exert "international pressure" on the Soviet Union, "forcing the Russians to change their position or find some way to revise or circumvent certain clauses of the (San Francisco) Treaty." In the San Francisco Peace Treaty, Japan has already declared its renunciation of southern Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands.

Shigemitsu is returning to Japan via the United States. During his participation in the London conference, he discussed the issue of Soviet-Japanese negotiations with U.S. Secretary of State Dulles. Dulles warned Shigemitsu at the time not to recognize Soviet sovereignty over the Kuril Islands and southern Sakhalin, otherwise the United States would occupy Okinawa for a long time.

### 重光向美国建议  召开国际会议讨论领土问题

    重光向美国建议
    召开国际会议讨论领土问题
    新华社1日讯　纽约消息：据“纽约先驱论坛报”8月31日报道，日本外务相重光葵曾经向美国政府“非正式”建议召开由旧金山和约的四十九个签字国参加的国际会议，来讨论库页岛南部和千岛群岛问题。
    根据国际协议，这些岛屿归苏联所有。但是日本在苏日谈判中坚持要苏联让出这些领土，以致使谈判中断。
    “纽约先驱论坛报”透露，重光葵的这个建议是要对苏联施加“国际压力”，“迫使俄国人改变他们的立场或者想某种办法来修改或避开（旧金山）和约中的某些条款”。在旧金山和约中，日本已经宣布放弃库页岛南部和千岛群岛。
    重光葵正取道美国回日本。他在参加伦敦会议期间，曾经同美国国务卿杜勒斯讨论了苏日谈判问题。杜勒斯当时警告重光不得承认苏联对千岛群岛和库页岛南部的主权，否则美国将长期占据冲绳岛。
