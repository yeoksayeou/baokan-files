    In early July, in Liling County, Hunan Province, 53 out of 99 cadres from 28 credit cooperatives were transferred to participate in central tasks such as summer harvest and pre-distribution. The Junchu Township Credit Cooperative had a total of four cadres, and three of them were taken away. When the credit cooperative requested that one less cadre be taken, Yao Xiande, the secretary of the township's Party branch, said, "Everything must obey the central task; the credit cooperative's business can be stopped." As a result, after the credit cooperative cadres were taken away, the masses' borrowing and withdrawals were affected.

    We believe that credit cooperative cadres should first do a good job in their business to serve the central work of the countryside. If it is necessary to transfer credit cooperative cadres to assist in the central work, it should not affect the work of the credit cooperative itself. Xin Ye

    也应该照顾信用社的工作
    七月上旬，湖南省醴陵县二十八个信用合作社的九十九个社干部中就有五十三个人被抽调去参加夏收、预分等中心工作。该县君楚乡信用社共有四个干部，就被抽走了三个，信用社要求少抽一个，乡的党支部书记姚先德说：“一切服从中心，信用社业务可以停止”，结果，社干部被抽走以后，群众借款、取款都受到影响。
    我们认为，信用社的干部，首先应当做好业务工作来为农村的中心工作服务，如需抽调信用社的干部协助中心工作时，也不应影响信用社本身的工作。　新野
