    Truly a "Dragging" Training Class
    I was demobilized from the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in March of this year and transferred to the Guizhou Provincial Department of Agriculture, where I was assigned to study at the Guizhou Provincial Tractor Training Class. This training class began drawing over a hundred people with technical foundations from various counties as early as January and February. These people were all demobilized soldiers, all obeying the orders of their superiors to come here, determined to complete their studies satisfactorily within six months. Who knew that after arriving here for half a year, school still hadn't started, and the comrades were disappointed. Our monthly expenses are about 2,000 yuan, wasting more than 10,000 yuan of the people's money in six months.
    Because of this reason, everyone calls this tractor training class the "Dragging-and-delaying Training Class." Everyone requested to temporarily participate in transportation work or other work, but the Department of Agriculture ignored them. Everyone requested the start of school, but all the school's construction had not been done well, so how could it formally start? Seeing that everyone's calls for work were getting louder day by day, the Department of Agriculture took an emergency measure on July 19—holding an opening ceremony. This "opening" was serious, as it was said that the study period would be changed to one year. More than twenty people, due to family difficulties, could not persist in a year of study and went to the Department of Agriculture to be introduced back to the Department of Civil Affairs for other work assignments. The Department of Agriculture had no choice but to introduce these twenty-odd demobilized soldiers to the Veterans' Guesthouse to rest. In this way, the training class was in chaos, with about fifty people being transferred out or voluntarily requesting to leave, leaving only more than forty people, and some of them are still ideologically uneasy.
    Please think, how should this training class continue?　Li Hong

### 真是“拖拉”训练班

    真是“拖拉”训练班
    我是今年3月由志愿军部队复员转业到贵州省农业厅的，被分配到贵州省拖拉机训练班学习。这个训练班从一、二月份就在各县抽调有技术基础的人员一百多人。这些人全都是复员军人，都服从上级的调动来到这里，决心要在半年内圆满地完成学习任务。谁知道来到这里已经半年了，还没有开学，同志们失望了。我们每月大约要开支两千元左右，六个月给人民浪费了一万多元。
    因为这个原故，大家把这个拖拉机训练班叫做“拖拖拉拉训练班”。大家要求暂时去参加运输工作或其他工作，但农业厅不理睬。大家要求开学，可是学校的一切建设都没有搞好，又怎么能正式开学呢？农业厅看到大家要求工作的呼声一天比一天高，才在7月19日采取一个紧急措施——举行开学典礼。这一“开学”不要紧，听说学习期要变成一年。有二十多个人因为家庭困难，不能坚持一年的学习，跑去找农业厅介绍回民政厅另行分配工作。农业厅没有办法，又把这二十多名复员军人介绍到荣军招待所去休息起来了。这样一来，训练班闹得乱七八糟，前前后后被调出去和自动要求出去的约五十多人，现在只剩下四十多人了，并且还有一部分人思想不安。
    请想想，这个训练班到底怎么办下去呢？　李宏
