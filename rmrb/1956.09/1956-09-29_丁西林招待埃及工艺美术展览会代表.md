    丁西林招待埃及工艺美术展览会代表
    新华社28日讯　中国人民对外文化协会副会长丁西林今晚举行宴会欢迎为举办埃及工艺美术展览会来我国的代表穆·爱·穆斯脱法和阿·萨·舍里夫。埃及驻中国大使哈桑·拉加卜应邀出席了宴会。
    丁西林在宴会上致词。他说，前几天公布的在中埃文化会谈纪要基础上将进一步签订的中埃文化合作协定，正是中埃人民深厚友谊的一个证明。他认为中国和埃及的亲密友谊和文化交流，进一步密切起来。丁西林并说：埃及人民保卫苏伊士运河主权的英勇斗争，已经得到中国人民的敬佩和兄弟般的支持。他举杯为中埃两国进一步的文化交流而干杯。
    拉加卜大使致词说，中埃两国有悠久的历史和文化。过去，帝国主义将这两个伟大国家割离开了；现在我们两国已从帝国主义枷锁下解脱出来，因此才有机会将两国文化联接起来。拉加卜大使说，现在中埃两国所有的关系都是为和平、为两国的利益而发展和扩大，愿我们两国的文化为和平工作。拉加卜大使举杯为中埃两国的幸福祝贺。
    穆斯脱法也在宴会上讲了话，他感谢中国对埃及在苏伊士运河问题的立场的支持，并表示愿为中埃文化交流而努力。
    今晚出席宴会作陪的有外交部西亚非洲司司长柯华、中国伊斯兰教协会副主任达浦生等。
