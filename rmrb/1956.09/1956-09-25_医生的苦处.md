    The Doctor's Troubles
    Cheng Wanli
    I heard a famous doctor's lament about the medical profession. He said: Our profession is similar to that of prison management in some ways: the former relieves patients' physical pain and allows them to live healthily; the latter reforms prisoners' thoughts and allows them to be upright people. And a patient's discharge from the hospital is similar to a prisoner's release from prison. When patients leave, they smile and express their gratitude to the doctor, while the doctor holds their hand and only says "I wish you happiness." They both don't say goodbye, nor do they want to see each other again. Doctors pour a lot of emotion into treating patients, and when patients recover, doctors see them off with friendship, reluctant to part but not expecting to meet again… Therefore, it is often difficult to bear.
    The doctor's distress is naturally real, but it is not impossible to resolve. Of course, no one who has recovered from illness hopes to return to the hospital bed, but healthy people who have suffered from serious illnesses and whose symptoms have completely disappeared will never forget the doctor's deep gratitude. This kind of friendship cultivated in the hospital can still be maintained and developed.
    The doctor's real troubles are probably something else. To do any job well, you must concentrate wholeheartedly. However, now many of our doctors are often distracted in their intense work, fearing mistakes; and when a patient dies, they are afraid of being sued by the family. There are many concerns. And in the process of diagnosis and treatment, patients often demand the use of expensive drugs, whether actually necessary or not. The most common thing heard is "the three elements": penicillin, streptomycin, and aureomycin. If they don't get it, patients even turn their faces and question: "Are you looking down on my illness?" Does the doctor not have the right to prescribe?
    The many cases of unreasonable accusations and random interference with doctors may be related to the fact that newspapers have often exposed many medical accidents in recent years. It is undeniable that there are cases of quack doctors killing people, and there have indeed been cases of forgetting scissors in the patient's stomach after completing an abdominal surgery. But such "doctors" are, after all, in the extreme minority. Using individual phenomena to replace the general, just because a certain doctor in a certain place was irresponsible and caused the patient to die, and then concluding that whenever a patient dies, it is because the doctor is irresponsible, this inverse theorem is obviously untenable. But this inverse theorem is circulating and playing a bad role.
    Medicine is still far from being able to cope with all human diseases. It is understandable to sympathize with patients' desire to recover quickly, but if this desire is divorced from the level of modern medical treatment, it is just wishful thinking.
    To allow doctors to work with peace of mind and joyfully, we must first respect science, respect other people's professions, and respect other people's authority, and not interfere with everything self-righteously. This is very necessary for the normalization of doctors' work.

    医生的苦处
    程万里
    听过一位名医对医生职业的感慨，他说：我们这个职业在某些地方同监狱的管理人员有些相似：前者是解除病人生理上的痛苦，让他们健康地生活着；后者是改造犯人的思想，让他们正直地作人。而病人出院也同犯人出狱有类似处。病人临走，满面含笑地向医生说着感谢的话，而医生拉着他的手也只说“祝你幸福”，彼此都是不说再见也不愿再见的。医生在治疗中对病人倾注了大量的感情，病人痊愈了，医生满怀着友谊之情送他出门，惜别又不期望重逢……因此常常不好受。
    医生的这种苦恼自然是实在的，但这种苦恼还不是不可以解除的。病好了还盼望着回到病床上的人诚然没有，但是害过大病、病象已经完全消除了的健康人，对医生的深切的感念却绝不因此磨灭。这种病院里培养出来的友谊还是可以维持和发展的。
    医生的真正的苦恼，恐怕是另外的东西。无论什么工作想做好，总得专心致志。可是现在我们许多医生在紧张的劳动中，却常常分心，怕出毛病；碰到病人死亡又怕被家属控告。顾虑很多。而病人在诊治过程中，不论实际上是否必要，动辄要求使用贵重药品，最常听到的是“三素”：青霉素、链霉素、金霉素。不照办，病人甚至翻脸质问：“你是不是瞧不起我的病？”难道医生没有处方的权利吗？
    对医生的无理责难和胡乱干涉的事情多，可能同近几年来报纸上常常揭露许多医疗事故有关。不必讳言，庸医杀人的事是有的，作完了剖腹手术把剪刀遗忘在病人肚子里的事也确曾出现过。但这样的“医生”毕竟是极少数。用个别现象代替一般，只因为某地某医生不负责任使病人死亡，便从此得出结论：凡是病人死亡，都是因为医生不负责任，这个逆定理显然不能成立。可是这个逆定理却流行着，起着坏作用。
    医学离能对付人类一切疾病的水平还远。病人希望迅速恢复健康的要求是应该同情的，但是这种要求如果脱离了现代医疗水平，便是空想。
    要让医生们安心地工作、愉快地工作，首先得尊重科学，尊重别人的职业、尊重别人的职权，不要自以为是地干涉一切。这对医生的工作正常化，是很必要的。
