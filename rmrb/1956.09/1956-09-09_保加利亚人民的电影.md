The Bulgarian Film Week will be held in ten major cities including Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Xi'an from September 9th to September 30th this year, featuring Bulgarian productions such as "Spring Returns to the Earth" and "What Happened on the Street."

Bulgarian cinema was born in 1910. At that time, the young director Gandoff (now an honorary artist) produced the first Bulgarian film, "The Elegant Bulgarian." In the decades that followed, a small group of enthusiastic artists produced many films based on the lives of the Bulgarian people under extremely difficult conditions. These films all had serious content, most of which depicted the historical facts of the Bulgarian people's struggle against Turkish aggression.

However, these efforts by honest artists to establish their national film industry not only failed to receive support from the government at the time, but were also suppressed and attacked by the reactionary rulers. Almost all of the films shown domestically were vulgar and inferior American and German films.

Only after the establishment of the people's regime did the Bulgarian film industry achieve true development. The Bulgarian Communist Party and the People's Government attached great importance to the film industry, and repeatedly issued instructions on the creation and organization of film art in various resolutions and orders. Under the initiative of the Bulgarian Communist Party, the nationalization of the entire film industry was completed in 1948 through a series of steps. Bulgarian cinema embarked on a new path of development.

Newsreel films were the first to develop. In 1944, during the fierce wave of the anti-fascist armed uprising, Bulgarian filmmakers, holding cameras, joined the people in the fierce struggle and recorded on film the final battles of Bulgaria's liberation from fascist rule. Over the past few years, newsreel films have played a major role in people's lives, frequently publicizing the measures of the Party and the People's Government, reflecting changes in the motherland's appearance, commending new figures, and reporting on various major events in social life, thus playing the role of a combat assistant to the Party.

Science popularization films have also developed rapidly. Bulgarian science popularization filmmakers closely combine the urgent tasks of socialist construction, using easy-to-understand and engaging forms to disseminate various scientific and technological knowledge to the people and introduce new achievements in science, technology, culture, and art. Bulgarian science popularization films such as "The Man in the Clouds," "The Story of a Cigarette," "Village Wedding," and "Heart Surgery" have received high praise not only domestically but also internationally.

In 1950, the first feature film of the Bulgarian people's cinema, "Eagle Kalin," was produced. This film reflects the socialist movement in Bulgaria in the 1890s through the process of the national hero Kalin's transformation from a patriot to a socialist. This was followed by a series of thought-provoking films, such as "Alarm Bells," "Morning of the Motherland," "Danka," "Under Oppression," and "September Heroes." The 1954 film "Song of Man" portrays the life and activities of the revolutionary poet Nikola Vaptsarov. The Bulgarian-Soviet co-produced color feature film "Heroes of Shipka" narrates the historical events of the Russian and Bulgarian armies crushing the five-century-long Turkish rule in the Balkans and establishing a free Bulgaria during the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-1878. The recently produced new film "The Builders of Dimitrovgrad" reflects the labor enthusiasm shown by young builders in this socialist construction.

Many of the above-mentioned films have been shown in our country and have been warmly welcomed by our audiences. From these films, we can see that Bulgarian filmmakers strive to achieve a clear ideological tendency and realistic depiction methods, and strive to truly reflect the conflicts and contradictions of reality. In just a few years, Bulgarian cinema has made rapid progress in artistic techniques such as playwriting, directing, and photography. The influence of bourgeois films, which was evident in the early stages, has long been eliminated, and the phenomenon of reflecting real life in a relatively simple and superficial manner has also been quickly overcome.

The rapid progress of the Bulgarian film industry is particularly evident in the two films that will be shown to Chinese audiences during the Bulgarian Film Week held in our country this time – "Spring Returns to the Earth" and "What Happened on the Street." "Spring Returns to the Earth" is the first Bulgarian film to reflect the socialist transformation of the countryside. The protagonist of the film, Midie, is a kind and hardworking ordinary farmer, but he does not understand the benefits of collectivization and does not believe in cooperatives. His wife, Gana, is a new type of rural woman who warmly supports the new socialist life. Different attitudes towards cooperatives cause conflict between them. The film provides a profound description of the breakdown of Midie's family. Finally, Midie is educated by the facts and finally returns to the big family of the cooperative. Midie is a typical representative of thousands of kind farmers who did not immediately recognize the road they should take, but finally resolutely embarked on the socialist cooperative road. The theme of this film is familiar to our audience. Our farmers, like Bulgarian farmers, are experiencing a huge transformation: from the road of individual economy to the bright road of collectivization. Undoubtedly, this film will arouse widespread repercussions among our audience. "What Happened on the Street" is the first comedy film in Bulgaria. This film expresses new people, new labor attitudes, and new love through the love story of an ordinary young working couple. The actor Karamychev, who plays the male lead, won an honorary diploma at the Ninth Karlovy Vary International Film Festival not long ago for his excellent performance in this film.

The material and technical foundation of the Bulgarian film industry has also developed extremely rapidly. In the past, Bulgaria had only more than two hundred film projection units, but now there are more than one thousand. In the past, Bulgaria did not have a formal film studio, but now there are feature film studios, newsreel film studios, and science popularization film studios. Currently, a national film center is being built in the scenic area of ​​Mount Vitosha near the capital Sofia, which will have the latest film production technology and equipment. This film center is scheduled to be completed in 1958, at which time the Bulgarian film industry can expand to produce fifteen to eighteen feature films annually, as well as a large number of newsreels and science popularization films.

The ranks of Bulgarian film creators have also grown rapidly. Many famous writers have participated in film creation work. For example, Daskalov, the author of "Spring Returns to the Earth," and Vasiliev, the author of "Alarm Bells," are both outstanding contemporary Bulgarian writers.

It can be expected that the prospect of the development of the Bulgarian film industry is infinitely beautiful. We warmly look forward to the masters of Bulgarian film art constantly creating more and better works.

    保加利亚人民的电影
    富澜
    今年9月9日到9月30日，北京、天津、上海、西安等十大城市，将陆续举行保加利亚电影周，放映保加利亚出品的“春回大地”、“大街上发生的事情”等影片。
    保加利亚电影诞生于1910年。当时，年青的导演干多夫（现为功勋艺术家）制成了第一部保加利亚影片“文雅的保加利亚人”。在以后几十年中，一小部分热心的艺术家在极为艰苦的条件下摄制了不少以本国人民生活为题材的影片。这些影片都具有较为严肃的内容，其中多半是描写保加利亚人民反对土耳其侵略的斗争史实的。
    但是，正直的艺术家们为建立本民族的电影事业而作的这种努力，不仅得不到当时政府的支持，而且还受到反动统治者的压制和打击。国内放映的几乎完全是美国和德国的庸俗、低劣的影片。
    只是在建立了人民政权之后，保加利亚电影事业才获得了真正的发展。保加利亚共产党和人民政府非常重视电影事业，在各种决议和命令中不止一次地对电影艺术的创作和组织工作等问题作了指示。在保加利亚共产党的倡议下，经过一系列步骤，在1948年完成了全部电影事业的国有化。保加利亚电影踏上了全新的发展道路。
    新闻纪录电影首先获得了发展。1944年，在反法西斯武装起义的激烈浪潮中，保加利亚电影工作者手持摄影机同人民一起投入了火热的斗争，在胶片上纪录下了保加利亚从法西斯统治下解放出来的最后的战斗。几年来，新闻纪录电影在人民生活中起了很大作用，它经常宣传党和人民政府的措施，反映祖国面貌的变化，表扬新人物，报道社会生活的各种重大事件，从而起到了党的战斗助手的作用。
    科学普及电影也得到了迅速的发展。保加利亚科学普及电影工作者紧密结合社会主义建设的迫切任务，用通俗易懂和引人入胜的形式向人民传播各种科学技术知识，介绍科学、技术、文化、艺术等方面的新成就。保加利亚的科学普及片“云中人”“一枝纸烟的经历”“村中婚礼”“心脏手术”等等不仅在国内，而且在国际上也得到了极高的评价。
    1950年制成了保加利亚人民电影的第一部艺术片“雄鹰卡林”。这部影片通过反抗土耳其侵略的民族英雄卡林从爱国主义者到社会主义者的变化过程，反映了上世纪九十年代保加利亚的社会主义运动。接着出现了一系列富有思想意义的影片，如“警钟”、“祖国的早晨”、“妲卡”、“在压迫下”、“九月英雄”等。1954年制成的影片“人之歌”表现了革命诗人尼古拉·瓦普查洛夫的生活和活动。保加利亚和苏联合制的彩色艺术片“石布卡的英雄们”，叙述了1877—1878年俄土战争中俄罗斯和保加利亚军队粉碎了延续达五个世纪之久的土耳其在巴尔干的统治、建立了自由的保加利亚的历史事迹。最近摄制的新片“建设季米特洛夫城的人们”，反映了青年建设者在这一社会主义建设中表现出来的劳动热情。
    上面谈到的影片，有许多曾在我国上映过，受到我国观众的热烈欢迎。从这些影片中，我们可以看出，保加利亚电影工作者力求达到鲜明的思想倾向性和现实主义的描写方法，力求真实地反映现实的冲突和矛盾。在短短的几年中，保加利亚电影在剧作、导演、摄影等艺术技巧上有迅速的提高。初期还曾表现出来的资产阶级电影的影响早已消除，比较简单和肤浅地反映现实生活的现象也迅速地得到了克服。
    保加利亚电影事业的飞速进步，在我国这次举行的保加利亚电影周中将要同中国观众见面的两部影片——“春回大地”和“大街上发生的事情”中，特别明显地反映出来。“春回大地”是保加利亚第一部反映农村社会主义改造的影片。影片主人公米迭是一个善良勤劳的普通农民，但是他不理解合作化的好处，不相信合作社。他的妻子甘娜却是热烈拥护社会主义新生活的新型农村妇女。对合作社的不同的态度造成他们夫妇之间的冲突。影片对米迭家庭的破裂作了深刻的描述。最后米迭在事实的教育下终于回到合作社的大家庭里来。米迭是千万个没有立即认清应该走的道路、但终于坚决走上了社会主义合作化道路的善良农民的一个典型的代表者。这部影片的题材是我国观众所熟悉的。我国农民正和保加利亚农民一样，在经历着一个巨大的变革：从个体经济的道路转到合作化的光明大道上来。无疑地这部影片将在我国观众中间引起广泛的反响。“大街上发生的事情”是保加利亚的第一部喜剧片。这部影片通过一对普通劳动青年的恋爱故事表现了新的人、新的劳动态度和新的爱情。扮演男主角的演员卡拉米切夫由于在这部影片中的优秀的表演，在不久前举行的第九届卡罗维·发利国际电影节上获得了荣誉奖状。
    保加利亚电影事业的物质技术基础也获得了极为迅速的发展。过去保加利亚只有二百多个电影放映单位，而现在则有一千多个了。过去保加利亚没有一座正式的制片厂，现在已有艺术电影制片厂、新闻纪录电影制片厂和科学普及电影制片厂。目前在首都索非亚附近的维脱施山风景区正在建设一座全国性的电影中心，这里将有最新式的电影生产技术设备。这个电影中心预定于1958年建成，那时保加利亚电影事业就可以扩大到每年制作十五到十八部艺术片以及大量的新闻纪录片和科学普及片。
    保加利亚电影创作工作者的队伍也迅速成长起来。许多著名的作家参加了电影创作工作。例如“春回大地”的剧作者达斯卡洛夫和“警钟”的剧作者瓦西列夫就都是保加利亚当代杰出的作家。
    可以预期，保加利亚电影事业发展的远景是无限美好的。我们热烈地期待着保加利亚电影艺术大师们不断地创造出更多更好的作品来。
