    A New Outburst of Mania
  　Hu Jin
    Nixon is at it again. This time, he delivered a speech at a gathering of the American Legion, clamoring for strengthening the "Cold War" and the arms race. He particularly strongly attacked the so-called "threat of the international communist movement," asserting that the United States should never "recognize" the People's Republic of China and should continue to exclude the People's Republic of China from the United Nations. Nixon even shamelessly said that the aggressive act of the US government in obstructing the peaceful liberation of Taiwan and the islands of Quemoy and Matsu by force was "one of the most outstanding examples of leadership that this country (the United States) has witnessed in the past four years."
    This is the most blatant expression of political attitude by Nixon since being nominated as the Republican vice-presidential candidate, proving that many people in the United States have reasons to be doubtful and opposed to his nomination as the vice-presidential candidate. Anyone familiar with Nixon's words and deeds knows that these outcries are nothing more than his usual clichés. However, due to Nixon's efforts to portray himself as moderate and inoffensive in order to please voters, and due to the special role he plays in this year's US election, the political attitude he expressed has importance. It is no accident that the Associated Press called Nixon's speech his "first major speech" since the Republican Party nominated him to run for continuous election.
    Nixon's nomination as the Republican vice-presidential candidate did not go smoothly. The "Dump Nixon Movement" initiated by Stassen was only contained after the Republican Party machine exerted strong pressure. However, it seems that Nixon has become ecstatic because of the strong support from the emerging financial magnates of the eastern United States and the most reactionary forces in the United States. The Democratic Party's proposed campaign platform does not differ from the Republican Party's on foreign policy, especially the inclusion of depriving the People's Republic of China of its legitimate seat in the United Nations, which also makes Nixon think that he does not need to use rhetoric to cover up his true political views.
    Nixon is an enthusiastic supporter and ally of Dulles' "brinkmanship" diplomacy, McCarthyism's terror, and "Taiwan lobbyist" Nolan's anti-People's Republic of China movement. In recent years, the international situation has tended to ease, McCarthyism has been spurned, and the policies of the Cold War and hostility towards the People's Republic of China have been repeatedly frustrated. Nixon has had to adopt a more restrained and disguised approach to support activities that adhere to reactionary policies.
      In July, on the eve of the Republican National Convention, Nixon appeared as a "sincere advocate of peace," repeatedly expressing his willingness to promote East-West exchanges and cultural contact, and even hypocritically saying: "We have no prejudice against the people of the Soviet Union and the people of Communist China. We welcome the opportunity to live peacefully with these people." As late as August 13, in his speech at the National Encampment of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, he claimed that the US foreign policy was to strive for a "just peace," "continue to strive for effective world disarmament," and formulate an "enlightened program" of exchange visits "to remove obstacles to world understanding," and so on. It is hard to see a more hypocritical figure on today's world political stage than Nixon and the group he represents.
    Of course, even when Nixon and his ilk most need to feign and deceive, they cannot deceive anyone, because everyone already knows that he is only trying to use the rhetoric of "just peace" to resist the peace aspirations of people of all countries, to interpret coexistence as something that does not conflict with the Cold War, and to use empty talk of disarmament and negotiations to cover up his peddling of suspicion and hatred towards the Soviet Union and people's democracies, seeking new conditions for intensifying the arms race.
    During his trip to Asia this year, Nixon thoroughly exposed the essence of the policies he pursued. The purpose of his trip was originally to try to restore the credibility of the United States' bankrupt Asian policy on the eve of the election, but the method he used was to continue to obstruct the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan by force, attack the peaceful and neutral policies of most Asian countries, and insult the selfless economic assistance of the Soviet Union and China to other countries and the countries that accept such assistance. As a result, Nixon only "helped" to further lower the prestige of the United States in Asia and aroused greater anger among the people of Asian countries.
    Now, Nixon has more nakedly revealed his true colors. He reiterated the notorious policy of "strength," lecturing the broad masses of people who demand peaceful coexistence and further easing of tensions to "have more common sense and less wishful thinking." He also scolded those in the United States and abroad who criticize the US government for "being too tough on the Communists" as "good-hearted but mistaken people," saying that they are "a threat to national security."
    After pretending to be kind for a period of time, Nixon has now revealed a hideous face again, which shows that the American reactionary group is attempting to use the greater unity of the two parties on the campaign platform under the campaign slogan of "peace and prosperity" to stir up new anti-communist hysteria, to suppress the desire for peace of the ordinary American people, and to pave the way for continuing the "Cold War" and expanding the arms race.
    However, from the experiences of Nixon and other representatives of the reactionary group, it can also be seen that getting into the dead end of the "Cold War" and continuing to stay there in the hope of making a difference will definitely not lead to any results. Former US Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Kennan, once one of the staunchest supporters of the "containment policy," recently expressed his unease in a speech, saying that "US foreign policy should undergo a major change," based on the fact that "when the world situation develops as hundreds of millions of people desire, a new world war has not occurred, and world tensions have not increased but eased, this policy will leave us speechless and at a loss." It is particularly noteworthy for certain current figures in the United States to heed Kennan's warning: do not confuse "what is possible in world affairs with what you want to do." Nixon and his ilk are precisely trapped in the quagmire they themselves have stirred up, and his extremely unrealistic fantasies and the new outburst of mania do not indicate that their situation has improved.

    狂热症的新发作
  　胡今
    尼克松又发作了。这一次他是在美国退伍军人团集会上发表演说，叫嚷加强“冷战”和军备竞赛。他特别强烈地攻击所谓“国际共产主义运动的威胁”，主张美国决不“承认”中华人民共和国，并要继续排斥中华人民共和国在联合国之外。尼克松甚至厚颜无耻地说，美国政府以武力阻挠台湾和金门马祖岛屿的和平解放的侵略行为是“这个国家（美国）在过去四年中所亲眼看到的最出色的领导榜样之一”。
    这是尼克松在当选为共和党副总统候选人之后最露骨地表示的政治态度，证明美国有许多人对选他为副总统候选人一事抱怀疑和反对态度是完全有道理的。凡熟悉尼克松的言行的人，都知道这些叫嚷本来也不过是他一贯的陈词滥调。但由于尼克松为了讨好选民，曾经一度竭力把自己装扮得温和而不讨人厌，由于他在今年美国大选中扮演的特殊角色，使他所表示的这一政治态度具有了重要性。合众社把尼克松这篇演说称之为共和党提名他参加连续竞选以来的“第一篇重要演说”，这不是偶然的。
    尼克松被提名为共和党副总统候选人，经过情况并不光彩。史塔生所发起的“倒尼克松运动”只是在共和党的党机器施加了强大压力之后才受到遏止的。可是看来尼克松已经因为得到美国东部新兴财阀和美国最反动势力的大力支持而得意忘形起来。民主党所提出的竞选纲领，在外交政策上同共和党没有任何分别，特别是其中一致把剥夺中华人民共和国在联合国的合法地位一点列入纲领之内，这也使尼克松认为他不那样须要用花言巧语来掩饰他的真正的政治主张。
    尼克松是杜勒斯“战争边缘”外交、麦卡锡主义的恐怖和“台湾议员”诺兰敌视中华人民共和国运动的狂热的支持者和同盟者。近年来国际局势趋向缓和，麦卡锡遭到了唾弃，冷战和敌视中华人民共和国的政策也一再受到挫折，尼克松不能不采取比较敛迹的和伪装的方法，来策应坚持反动政策的活动。
      7月间，也就是在共和党提名大会前夕，尼克松以“和平的真诚宣扬者”的姿态出现，一再表示愿意促进东西方的往来和文化接触，甚至假惺惺地说：“我们对苏联人民和共产党中国人民都没有偏见。我们欢迎有机会同这些人民和平共处”。直到8月13日，他在美国国外战争退伍军人全国营地发表的演说，还声称美国的外交政策是争取“光荣的和平”，“继续争取有效的世界裁军”，“为消除阻碍世界谅解”而制定一项交换访问之类的“开明的计划”等等。人们在今天的世界政治舞台上再难看到比尼克松和他所代表的集团更伪善的了。
    当然，就是在尼克松之流最需要作伪和蒙混的时候，他也决欺骗不了什么人，因为大家已经熟知，他只是想用“光荣的和平”的言论来抵挡各国人民的和平愿望，想把共处解释成同冷战毫不冲突的东西，想用裁军和谈判的空谈来遮掩他贩卖对苏联和人民民主国家的猜忌和仇视，为加紧进行军备竞赛找寻新的条件。
    尼克松在今年的亚洲之行中，就曾彻底地揭穿了他所奉行的政策的实质。他此行的目的原是企图在选举的前夕为美国破了产的亚洲政策挽回威信，但使用的方法却是继续以武力阻挠中国人民解放台湾，攻击亚洲大多数国家的和平中立政策，侮辱苏联和中国对其他国家无私的经济援助和接受这种援助的国家。因此，结果，尼克松只是“帮助”进一步降低了美国在亚洲的威信，引起亚洲各国人民更大的愤怒。
    现在，尼克松更赤裸裸地显露了原形。他重申臭名远扬的“实力地位”的政策，教训要求和平共处和进一步缓和紧张局势的广大人民“多有些常识而少抱些主观愿望。”他还骂美国国内外批评美国政府“对共产党人的态度太强硬”的人为“心地善良但是错误的人”，说他们是“对国家安全的威胁。”
    尼克松在一个时期装成善良的样子之后，现在又露出一副狰狞面目，这表明了美国反动集团正在“和平和繁荣”的竞选口号下，企图利用两党在竞选纲领上的更大的一致，掀起新的反共歇斯底里，来压制普通美国人民要求和平的愿望，为继续进行“冷战”和扩大军备竞赛开辟道路。
    但是，从尼克松以及反动集团中的其他代表人物的经历中，也可以看到钻进“冷战”的死胡同，并继续呆在那里而想使自己有所作为，肯定是不会有什么结果的。一度是“遏止政策”的最坚定的拥护者之一的前美国驻苏大使凯南，在最近的一篇演说中完全有理由地表示不安说，“美国对外政策应有重大改变”，根据是“当世界形势像亿万人民所渴望的那样发展，新的世界大战竟然没有发生，世界紧张局势也没有增加而是缓和了的时候，这种政策将使我们陷于手足无措的一言难发的地步”。特别值得美国当前的某些当权人物注意的是凯南的这个警告：不要把“世界事务中能以办得到的事同你想办到的事混搅起来了。”尼克松之流正是陷在他们自己搅混了的泥潭中，他的极不现实的幻想和狂热症的新发作，决不是说明他们的处境已经好了一些。
