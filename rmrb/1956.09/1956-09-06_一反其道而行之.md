    “Going Against the Grain”
    Mǎ Qiánzú
    On August 25th, Guangming Daily's "Literary Life" published an article, "The Iron Ruler for Measuring Literature," presenting a positive argument from a negative example, and it was quite vivid. Although I don't know all the plays and movies involved, it seems to hit the "current malpractices" of literary criticism quite accurately. However, the concluding paragraph aroused some thoughts in me. The article says:
    "People are clamoring for 'artistic analysis.' Art for art's sake! Literature and art are like a teacup; the porcelain body is the content, that is, political nature, and artistic quality is just a little bit of fancy decoration painted on the outside. Without this 'artistic quality,' wouldn't the teacup still be a teacup? What's all the fuss about 'artistic characteristics'? Isn't it just trying to 'fight the world for art's sake'? This unhealthy trend should be rectified."
    In fact, if the flowers and plants on the teacup are painted beautifully, no one would dislike it. No matter how incompetent literary critics are, they would still appreciate it. But indeed, the porcelain body is very important. Try it, put a teacup with "fancy decoration" but a hole next to a clean, white, but complete teacup, which one would you rather buy? In my opinion, the common people would rather buy the latter, and so would I. However, it is also possible that a person with a passion for antiques would treat it as a Shang Dynasty bronze or a Zhou Dynasty vessel, buy it, and display it in a rosewood frame. Ordinary people like us don't have such refined interests because I buy it to drink tea.
    It is wrong for critics to emphasize political nature and ignore artistic quality when criticizing specific works. But to say that critics originally didn't want art, I don't think that's the case. It is also a fact that criticism is written in a naive, mechanical, and crude way, but if emphasizing some political nature becomes a crime, then I dare not accept it.
    Writing this, I can't help but quote a passage from the ancients. It's in classical Chinese, so I apologize to the readers for the trouble, but please read it as a classical work. It says:
    "What is called literature is only to be beneficial to the world. What is called rhetoric is like carvings and paintings on utensils. If they are clever and beautiful, they are not necessarily practical; if they are practical, they are not necessarily clever and beautiful. The essential thing is practicality, and the carvings and paintings are just decorations. If it is not practical, it is not a utensil. If there are no decorations, how would it be? However, it cannot be stopped, do not put it first." (Wang Anshi)
    I quite agree with the views of this ancient person. When discussing literature, politics should come first, and art second. As for writers, they naturally first "feel something" and then "do something," using "art" to express "content."
    However, since we introduced the Soviet "Communist" magazine's special article on typical issues in literature and art, some people in our criticism circles, after criticizing criticism, have even negated the requirements that works should reflect the essence of life phenomena, express the contradictions in life, and describe typical positive heroic characters, etc. Moreover, they even have the tone that works don't necessarily need to pay attention to ideological content, as long as they have artistic quality, as if they want to have the spirit of "going against the grain" to those past advocates. What benefit is this to socialist construction?
    Of course, this can also be regarded as a school of thought in "a hundred schools of thought contend." But I still have my "thoughts."

    “一反其道而行之”
    马前卒
    8月25日光明日报的文艺生活上，登载一篇“量文的铁尺”，反面文章正面做，说来有声有色。我虽不全都知道所涉及的话剧、电影，但看来怕颇击中目前文艺批评的“时弊”吧。只是结末一段，颇引起我一些感想。文云：
    “人们嚷嚷，说什么要‘艺术分析’。艺术至上主义！文艺好比一个茶杯，那磁胎是内容，即政治性，艺术性不过是描在外面的一点花花草草，没有这些‘艺术性’，茶杯还不是茶杯？吵吵什么‘艺术特征’，还不是想‘为艺术而艺术’打天下，该整整这股歪风了。”
    其实呢，如果茶杯花花草草的描得很好看，那是没有人会不喜欢的。文艺批评家怎么不济，还是会赏识的。但的确，磁胎很重要。试试看，一边摆着个“花花草草”、但有破洞的茶杯，另一边摆着个净白的、但完整的茶杯，倒底愿意买哪一个？据我看，老百姓是愿意买后面一个的，我也是。可是，也说不定，有古董癖的人，会把它当做商鼎周彝，买去供在红木架里，这是像我们这样的平凡人，没有那样雅兴了。因为，我买它，为的喝茶。
    批评家在批评具体作品时，强调了政治性，忽略了艺术性，这是不对的。但说批评家原本不要艺术，我看事实不是如此。批评写得幼稚、机械和粗暴，也是事实，但强调一些政治性，就成为罪名，那可不敢领教了。
    写到这里，我禁不住要引一段古人的话。是文言，辛苦读者了，但还当古典作品读吧。文云：
    “所谓文者，务为有补于世而已矣。所谓辞者，犹器之有刻镂绘画也。诚使巧且华，不必适用；诚使适用，亦不必巧且华。要之以适用为本，以刻镂绘画为之容而已。不适用，非所以为器也。不为之容，其亦若是乎否也。然亦未可已也，勿先之其可也。”（王安石）
    我是颇为同意这个古人的主张的。论文，还是政治第一，艺术第二。至于作家呢，那自然是先“有所感”，然后“有所为”，以“艺术”来表达“内容”的。
    可是自从我们介绍了苏联“共产党人”杂志关于文学艺术中的典型问题的专论以来，我们的批评界的有些人，于批评了批评之余，连作品应该反应生活现象的本质，表现生活中的矛盾，描写积极的英雄人物的典型等等的要求，也给它否定了，而且还有作品大可不必讲求思想内容，只要有艺术性就好了的口气，好像要对过去那些提倡，有“一反其道而行之”的气概，这又有何利于社会主义的建设事业呢？
    自然，这也可以作为“百家争鸣”中的一个流派吧。但我还有我的“感想”。
