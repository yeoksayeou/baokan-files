Emphasizing the Spiritual Food of the Nation
Yu Yi

In the past two years, various sectors have raised many opinions regarding our book distribution work. However, Xinhua Bookstore still hasn't come up with specific ways to improve its work. It seems like it will be "put off indefinitely" again. Don't we have a saying: "Let them laugh and scold as they please, a good official I will be"? When the year-end summary comes around, the newspapers will likely publish an article on "The Achievements of Book Publishing and Distribution Work in 1956," be it a news item or a report, stating how many types and copies of books we have published and distributed, and that the quantity is increasing rapidly. As for quality, it seems this is not worth considering.

Readers complain about not being able to buy books; publishers complain that good books sell poorly, while Xinhua Bookstore makes arbitrary decisions about print runs; Xinhua Bookstore complains that the content summaries of new books from publishers are simple and unreliable. No one seems to come forward to consider how to solve these problems. Indeed, some people think this way: as long as the task is completed, it means building socialism. And the task given by the "higher-ups" happens to be a certain number of types and copies. If publishers don't publish enough types and copies, and Xinhua Bookstore doesn't sell enough types and copies, they will be criticized and have to make self-criticisms. As long as the books and periodicals published and sold are not counter-revolutionary, then even if a single good book is not published or sold (this is naturally a hypothetical situation), they will still be praised, because the task has been over-fulfilled.

Everyone is working hard to complete the task. To complete the task, publishers only need to produce enough types and copies of books, because Xinhua Bookstore determines the sales figures before a book is printed. According to the old rule of "goods once out of the door, no returns," there is no need to worry about the books not selling. Although Xinhua Bookstore hasn't seen the books, it decides what readers need based on a hundred-word content summary, but branch managers think: these figures come from the sales staff in the bookstores, so they can't be wrong. If too few books are printed and readers can't buy them, it's called "controlling distribution." Readers should learn to "buy whatever is available." If too many books are printed and readers are unwilling to buy them, they can be sent to libraries in large quantities, and the opportunity to launch book donation campaigns can also be used. The latter is a particularly outstanding sales method. For example, when Shanghai launched a book donation campaign for rural youth this year, Gaoqiao Town in the East Suburbs received 1,500 donated books: 900 copies of one type and 600 copies of another. Xinhua Bookstore's sales task was completed, but the right of rural youth to read was deprived. For example, when Shanghai launched the "June 1st" book donation campaign this year, Xinhua Bookstore sold 400,000 copies of its inventory at once. Shanghai Xinhua Bookstore may be praised for completing its sales task, but how many children have lost the opportunity to read books. Judging solely from the facts recently revealed by Xinhua News Agency reporter Comrade Yang Ying, it is necessary to thoroughly inspect our book distribution work, and it is necessary to seriously reform Xinhua Bookstore's sales methods.

We should remember an old saying: "Man does not live on rice alone," he also needs spiritual food. It is hoped that comrades who have the power and responsibility in book distribution work will value the spiritual food of the nation.

    重视全国人民的精神食粮

    近两年来各方面对我们的图书发行工作提过不少的意见。可是新华书店至今没有改进工作的具体办法。大概又是“一拖了之”了。我们不是有过一句俗话：“笑骂由他笑骂，好官我自为之”吗？到了年终总结的时候，报纸上可能又会发表一篇“1956年图书出版和发行工作的成就”，不论是消息或报告，说我们出版，发行了多少种、多少册书，而且数量增加得很快。质量呢，好像这是不值得考虑的。
    读者抱怨买不到书；出版社抱怨好书销得少，而新华书店决定印数时又太武断；新华书店抱怨出版社的新书内容介绍写得简单而不可靠。始终不见有人出来考虑怎样解决这些问题。的确有些人是这样想的：只要完成任务就是在建设社会主义。而“上级”给的任务偏偏又是多少种和多少册。倘使出版社出不够多少种和多少册，新华书店销不到多少种和多少册，就得受批评作检讨。只要出的、销的不是反革命的书刊，那么即使不出、不销一本好书（这自然是假设的话），也会受到表扬，因为任务是超额地完成了。
    大家都在为着完成任务努力。为了完成任务，出版社只消出足那许多种和许多册书，反正一本书付印前新华书店就定了销货数字，照“货物出门，概不退换”的老规矩，用不着愁书销不出去。新华书店虽然没有看到图书，单凭百十字的内容介绍就代读者决定了他们的需要，但是分店负责人心里想：这些数字是从门市部营业员那里来的，总不会错。书印少了，读者买不到，这叫做“控制发行”。读者应该学会“有啥买啥”，要是书印多了，而读者又不肯买，还可以大批地送到图书馆去，而且还可以利用发动赠书的机会。后一种尤其是出色的推销办法。例如今年上海发动赠送农村青年图书的时候，东郊区高桥镇就收到一千五百册赠书：一种九百册，一种六百册。新华书店的销售任务完成了，而农村青年看书的权利就给剥夺了。又如今年上海发动“六一”赠书的时候，新华书店一次销出了四十万册的存货。上海新华书店可能因为完成了销货任务受到表扬，可是多少儿童就失去了看书的机会。单单从最近新华社记者杨瑛同志揭露的事实看来，我们的图书发行工作也有彻底检查的必要了，新华书店的销货办法也有认真改革的必要了。
    我们应当记得一句老话：“人不是单靠吃米活着的”，他也需要精神的食粮。希望在图书发行工作这方面有职有权的同志们重视全国人民的精神食粮。
