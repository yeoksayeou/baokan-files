This art delegation, invited by the China-Indonesia Friendship Association, was selected and formed under the instructions of Indonesian President Sukarno. It will conduct a three-month performance tour in China.

These envoys of friendship from the Indonesian people, who have traveled across the ocean and over thousands of miles, received a grand welcome from more than a thousand Chinese literary and art figures at the Beijing Railway Station today. To the sound of welcoming music, the distinguished guests stepped off the special train. Hu Yuzhi, Vice President of the China-Indonesia Friendship Association, Zheng Zhenduo, Deputy Minister of Culture, Wang Renshu, Director of the China-Indonesia Friendship Association, and others shook hands with the head of the art delegation, Saléh Umar, Third Vice Chairman of the Indonesia-China Friendship Association and Member of Parliament, as well as the delegation members.

Hu Yuzhi spoke at the welcoming ceremony. He welcomed the arrival of the art delegation on behalf of the China-Indonesia Friendship Association and wished the art delegation a successful performance in China. He said that the Chinese people have long been known for the excellent Balinese dance. Today, being able to meet with Balinese artists here is like seeing relatives from afar.

When Saléh Umar spoke, he conveyed the warm and friendly feelings of the Indonesian people towards the Chinese people. He said: Our belief is to work together to cultivate this noble friendship. In participating in the construction of this precious and happy edifice of friendship, we would be honored to place even the smallest brick in it. (See photo)
