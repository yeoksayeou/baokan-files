    "Green Dragon Mud Soap"
    Since 1950, I have been using "Green Dragon Soap". This soap is large, white, and of very good quality. After drying, one bar can wash more than twenty pieces of clothing. I love using this soap and often promote it. However, recently I bought a yellow "Green Dragon Soap" at the cooperative, which was very soft and slippery. When I used it, it turned into a clump of mud. This is a product of a state-owned factory in Wuhan. The factory name hasn't changed, and the brand hasn't changed, but the quality has become so poor. I wonder what the reason is?

    “青龙泥皂”
    从1950年起，我就用“青龙肥皂”。这种肥皂块大，色白，质量很好，晒干后一块能够洗二十多件衣服。我很爱用这种肥皂，并且经常替它宣传。可是，最近我在合作社买的一块黄色“青龙肥皂”，非常软滑，拿去一用，就成了一团泥浆。这是武汉市国营厂的产品，厂名没有变，牌子也没有变，质量却变得这样差了，不知是什么原因？
