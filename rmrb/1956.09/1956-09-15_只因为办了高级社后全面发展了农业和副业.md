The Qunsheng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Feidong County, Anhui Province, with a population of over four thousand, including adults and children, can achieve an average per capita net income of over one hundred yuan this year. 98% of the cooperative's farmers can increase their income compared to last year. Why is this?

Just Because a Higher-Level Cooperative Was Established, Agriculture and Sideline Occupations Have Fully Developed
By Our Reporter Yu Ming

Not long ago, I learned about the actual annual income of members of the Qunsheng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Feidong County, Anhui Province. Together with the cooperative cadres, I investigated the income situation of households in the hilly area and the polder area, poor peasants who joined the cooperative last year and those who did not, middle peasants who joined the cooperative last year and those who did not, households with more labor but less land and those with more land but less labor, as well as those who used to work outside and are now working in the cooperative. These people surveyed were all households that the teams considered might have a decrease in income compared to last year. However, the results of the investigation showed that they all increased their income compared to last year. The following are the situations of several households that were considered most likely to have decreased income:

Li Yingzhen is a poor peasant living in the hilly area. The whole family has nine members, with two men working outside. Only she and her sister-in-law are full laborers, and an old grandmother is over seventy years old, taking care of four children at home. Last year, their total income from work points and land dividends (40%) was 324 yuan. This year, they still have the same labor force and have already earned 1,100 work points so far. According to the cooperative's preliminary calculation, each labor work point is worth about 0.216 yuan. 1,100 work points is 237 yuan. As long as each person does another 200 work points, they can catch up with the total income of last year.

Xia Jiatao is a member of the 17th team, a poor peasant who did not join the cooperative last year, living in the semi-hilly and semi-polder area. The whole family has twelve members, with his younger brother working outside. Only his two sisters-in-law, parents, and Xia Jiatao participate in labor, and the remaining six are children. Last year, when they were in a mutual aid team, they planted 7.2 mu of land, harvested 1,100 jin of wheat, 3,440 jin of rice, and 600 jin of sweet potatoes. After paying agricultural tax and various expenses (such as cattle labor, fertilizer, seeds, etc.), there was a grain shortage for three months of the year, relying on his younger brother's work money and Xia Jiatao's sideline occupations to subsidize. After joining the cooperative this year, they also received 1,100 jin of wheat in the summer, but this was net income, without any expenses; they also received 40 yuan in cash. During the early rice harvest, the whole family received 495 jin of rice. Now the whole family has earned 4,100 work points. Even based on the current work points, the income has increased more than double compared to the entire last year. Xia Jiatao said: "In the past, planting that little land was not enough to keep us busy; this year, there is work to do every day, and we can use our energy to the fullest."

Xia Jiaqing is a middle peasant, a member of the primary cooperative last year, now in the second team. The whole family has four members, two full laborers, and two children. In 1955, they received 300 jin of wheat, 4,000 jin of rice, and 50 yuan in cash. The total annual income was 330 yuan. This year, the whole family has earned 1,500 labor work points, also calculated at 0.216 yuan per labor work point, which can get more than 320 yuan; when the late rice is harvested, the whole family can do 2,000 work points, which will greatly increase compared to last year's income. In terms of sideline occupations, last year only two families raised one pig together and kept five chickens. This year, because the cooperative's flour mill can supply bran for pig feed, they raised a pig themselves, which has already been fattened and sold. Now the small pig being fed can still be sold for 50 yuan in November of this year. The income from pig farming alone can get 40 yuan a year after deducting costs. This year, they also raised fourteen chickens and planted 2.5 fen of vegetable garden. In the vegetable garden, as long as they take care of it in the morning and evening, not only do they have vegetables to eat, but they can also pick vegetables to sell at the market every four or five days for four or five yuan. With extra spending money, they sell fewer eggs and eat more themselves. Life is much more comfortable than in previous years.

Xia Yongqiu is a member of the 16th team, a middle peasant, who was still in a mutual aid team last year. The whole family has eighteen members, with two people working outside. In addition to five and a half laborers, the whole family has ten children. Last year, they had 25 mu of land, and the mutual aid team harvested a total of 10,400 jin of rice, more than 300 jin of sweet potatoes, and 10 jin of cotton. The grain harvested, after deducting the cost of cattle labor, waterwheels, seeds, and fertilizer, was just enough to eat, and there was no money to buy oil and salt. With so many people in the family, just buying oil, salt, matches, and other daily necessities cost five or six yuan a month. Clothing was even more difficult to afford. Last year, they raised twelve chickens and bought a pig together in September, but then sold it. This year, the whole family raised two pigs and still raised twelve chickens. Xia Yongqiu said that this year the wheat they received was not only enough to eat, but they also received 20 yuan in cash, followed by 720 jin of early rice. The income is continuous, and however much comes in, that's what they get, without having to deduct expenses anymore. Now the whole family has earned 4,500 work points. Calculating at 0.216 yuan per labor work point, the income so far this year is already more than half of last year's. Xia Yongqiu said that this year, because there is enough grain to eat and there is spending money, even I, this 62-year-old man, and my three daughters-in-law are full of energy the more we work.

Xia Jiafu's family has many people and few laborers. Only the husband and wife participate in labor, and there are five children. Last year, when they were in the primary cooperative, the two of them did a total of 240 labor days, and the income they received totaled 432 yuan. This year, the husband and wife are participating in labor, and they have already earned 2,100 work points so far, already exceeding the total income of last year. Last year, the family did not raise chickens or ducks, but only jointly raised a pig with six other families. This year, they raised ten ducks and six chickens themselves. Three children in the family go to school, and two children are sent to the nursery group. Life is very happy.

Xia Guangrong is a household with little labor and much land. He did not join the cooperative last year. There is only an old grandmother in the family, who has 6.3 mu of land, and her daughter is studying at Anhui Medical College. Last year, they harvested a total of 2 shi of wheat, 15 shi of rice, 5 shi of sweet potatoes, and 30 jin of cotton, plus 24 yuan for rice straw. But cattle labor and manual labor cost 8 shi of rice; after deducting agricultural tax and so on, the actual annual income was only 6 shi of rice and 24 yuan for rice straw. The total annual income was about 80 yuan. This year, the old lady alone has earned 500 work points, and now she can get more than 100 yuan, which is much more than last year. According to the old lady, she will strive to earn another 200 work points this year.

Basket maker Xia Yongji used to travel from village to village doing work, only having work for two or three months before the summer and autumn harvests; after his own meals, he could only earn 0.8 yuan a day. Now, he makes bamboo ware needed for agricultural and sideline production in the cooperative. The work is constant. If there is less bamboo ware work, he can immediately switch to agriculture. The remuneration for agricultural work is much higher than the remuneration for traveling from village to village. Now, there is no time to be idle all year round.

According to the cooperative's management committee's investigation in all teams and overall accounting, the cooperative can earn a total of 600,000 yuan this year. As long as 20% is deducted, it is enough for production investment, agricultural tax, public welfare fund, accumulation fund, and management expenses, and the remaining 80% can be distributed to the members. In this way, 98% of the cooperative's members can increase their income. This year, 64% of the cooperatives in Feidong County will enable more than 90% of their members to increase their income.

How did this cooperative achieve a 98% increase in income for its members? Their method is to carry out practical reforms in agriculture and to greatly develop collective sideline occupations, while supporting the family sideline occupations of the members.

***

This cooperative was formed last winter by expanding and upgrading from a primary cooperative of 113 households to a higher-level cooperative of 1,020 households. The cooperative has 7,695 mu of cultivated land and a population of 4,361 people, with an average of over 1.7 mu of land per person. Last year, when it was a primary cooperative, the average yield per mu was 580 jin; this year, the yield per mu will reach 1,000 jin. Last year, each person received an average of 800 jin of grain; this year, the total grain produced is expected to be 1,500 jin per person, enough grain for three years' consumption in one year. In terms of sideline production, last year there were very few sideline occupations other than the flour mill. After the establishment of the higher-level cooperative, the collective sideline occupations operated are more diverse and well-managed. Each labor day can receive 0.5 yuan from sideline production.

In agricultural production, what is different this year from previous years is that the area of summer harvest crops such as wheat, barley, and rapeseed has more than doubled compared to previous years; early rice, which was rarely planted before, was planted on more than 600 mu this year. Among them, the average yield of wheat increased by 60 jin per mu compared to previous years, while the yield of early rice reached an average of 610 jin per mu. These two major reforms have brought great changes to the lives of the members. In the past, there was little grain harvested in the summer, and from the summer harvest to the harvest of mid-season rice, farmers had to eat barley paste to make ends meet; this year, the members have wheat and early rice, and they eat rice a month earlier, selling the excess wheat to the state.

This cooperative, relying on the Nanfei River, dug a ditch last winter and this spring, and repaired an old ditch, pumping river water to the hilly land, converting more than 1,000 mu of dry land into paddy fields. In addition, more than 1,000 mu of paddy fields that could not be guaranteed a harvest in the past can now be guaranteed. The result of this reform is that the double-cropping area of early, mid-, and late-season rice in the cooperative reached more than 7,000 mu, which is equal to all the cultivated land in the cooperative being planted with rice once; in the past, only one season of mid-season rice was planted, and the rice area only accounted for 45% of the cultivated land. Farmers in the hilly areas who could not eat rice in the past are now eating the rice they produce themselves.

The reform of crop varieties is even more unprecedented. This year, the cooperative has added 13 kinds of improved varieties. Victory No. 100 sweet potato, Daizi cotton, Victory rapeseed, and some improved varieties of early and late rice are all welcomed by the members. Members no longer just eat rice all day long like they used to. They have a variety of foods, and what they eat has become richer.

This cooperative has also increased 400 mu of cultivated land by reclaiming wasteland and merging field ridges. Soil improvement has been carried out on 70 to 80 mu of cultivated land. There is also more fertilizer applied to the fields than in previous years.

After the above reforms were implemented in agriculture, this year's grain yield per mu will increase by more than 40% compared to last year.

The collective sideline occupations of this cooperative play a very important role in the income of farmers. Among the collective sideline occupations, the flour mill helps agriculture the most; but the most income comes from raising ducks. Processing 100 jin of beans in the flour mill can get 150 jin of bran and 15 dan of flour water. Bran and flour water are good feed for pigs and livestock. Zhao Qinghua, director of the cooperative, said that the flour water feeds the pigs and livestock fat and strong; last winter and this spring, all 157 cattle grew fat because they were fed flour water, and none of them got sick. The fertilizer effect of flour water is equal to water manure. As long as 20 dan of flour water is applied to one mu of rice field, it can guarantee increased production. This year, because there are more than 20 mills in the cooperative grinding flour, the rice fields have been fertilized sufficiently. Without flour water, it would be difficult to meet the fertilizer needs for double cropping. Although the flour mill only earned about 10,000 yuan in half a year, the indirect wealth it created is very large. The cooperative has set up an incubator room this year, using artificial heating to hatch chickens, geese, and ducks. This year, 120,000 ducks have been hatched, and all but 30,000 for self-raising have been sold. The income from hatching ducks and raising ducks alone will reach 58,000 yuan for the whole year, accounting for half of the total sideline income and about one-tenth of the total income of the cooperative.

This cooperative also used ponds to carry out three kinds of sideline production. There are 100 ponds in the cooperative, raising 100,000 fish. Calculated at a survival rate of 60%, 60,000 fish can get a net profit of 10,000 yuan by the end of the year; and the original cost of fish fry was only 204 yuan. The cooperative also has 50 ponds of water chestnuts and 20 ponds of bananas, which are growing very well now. Although these sideline occupations do not cost much and can get great profits, they have never been used so well in the past due to the limitations of small production.

In addition, there are sideline occupations such as grain processing and transportation. Preparations are also underway to open a brick and tile kiln to prepare conditions for developing sideline production this autumn and winter.

The annual income from collectively operated sideline occupations will reach more than 100,000 yuan, accounting for more than one-fifth of the total agricultural and sideline income.

Just the sideline income in the first half of this year, the average household has received about 15 yuan; households with more labor have received more than 40 yuan.

The cooperative's collectively operated sideline occupations support the family sideline occupations of the members. Many of the chickens, ducks, and geese hatched in the cooperative's incubator room are sold to the members. Each member's family raises 20 to 30 chickens, and many also raise geese and ducks. The cooperative raises sows, which can breed piglets, and the flour mill supplies bran and flour water as feed. It is expected that by next year, every household will be raising pigs. Some members also catch fish and shrimp and hang eels, which can also increase their income.

In the Qunsheng Agricultural Cooperative, a scene of abundant grain and flocks of chickens and ducks is presented. Elderly farmer Xia Yongqiu said: "It has always been said that 'three mountains, six waters, and one fen of land, farmers all over the world cannot cultivate it all.' But this year we have not only eliminated vacant land, but also planted one and two seasons of crops more, and the sideline production is so good, how can life not be good!"

    安徽省肥东县群生农业生产合作社，四千多口人，大人小孩都在内，今年平均每人的纯收入可以达到一百多元，全社98％的农户都可以比去年增加收入。这是为什么？
    只因为办了高级社后全面发展了农业和副业
    本报记者　于明
    不久以前，我在安徽肥东县群生农业生产合作社了解了社员全年的实际收入情况。我同社干部在一起，对岗区和圩区，去年入社的贫农和去年未入社的贫农，去年入社的中农和去年未入社的中农，劳力多而土地少和土地多而劳力少的户，以及过去在外作工，现在在社里作工的人的收入，作了一些调查。这些被调查的人，都是各队认为可能比去年收入减少的户。可是，调查的结果说明，他们却都比去年增加了收入。下面是几个被认为最可能减少收入的农户的情况：
    李英珍，是住在岗区的贫农。全家九口人，有两个男人在外作工，家里只她和弟媳妇是整劳动力，一个老奶奶已经七十多岁，在家照顾四个小孩。她们去年所得工分和土地分红（?40％）共得到三百二十四元。今年她们还是那些劳动力，到现在已得了一千一百个工分。按照社里的初步计算，每个劳动工分约值二角一分六。一千一百个工分就是二百三十七元。只要每人再作二百个工分，就能赶上去年全年的收入。
    夏家涛是十七队的队员，贫农，去年未入社，住在半岗半圩区。全家十二口人，弟弟在外作工，只妯娌二人、父母和夏家涛参加劳动，其余六个都是小孩。去年在互助组的时候，种七亩二分田，收一千一百斤麦子、三千四百四十斤稻谷、六百斤山芋（甘薯），一年除交农业税和各种花费（如牛工、肥料、种子等），一年有三个月缺口粮，靠弟弟作工的钱和夏家涛作副业补助。今年入社以后，夏季也分到一千一百斤麦子，但这是净得，没有什么花项了；另外还分到四十元现款。在收早稻时，全家分到四百九十五斤稻子。现在全家已得到四千一百个工分。就从现在的工分算，已经比去年全年的收入增加一倍以上。夏家涛说：“过去种那点田，活老不够作；今年天天有活作，有劲可以尽量使出来了。”
    夏家庆是中农，去年已是初级社的社员，现在在第二队。全家四口人，两个整劳动力，两个小孩。1955年分三百斤麦子、四千斤稻谷，另外还分了五十元现款。全年合计共收入三百三十元。今年全家已得了一千五百个劳动工分，也按每个劳动工分值二角一分六计算，可得到三百二十多元；到晚稻收完，全家可作到二千个工分，比去年的收入将大大增加。在副业方面，去年只是两家养一口猪，自养母鸡五只。今年因为社里粉房能供应粉渣喂猪，自己养了一口猪，已经养肥出卖。现在喂的一口小猪，到今年十一月时，还可卖五十元。光是喂猪的收入，一年除去成本就可以得到四十元。今年还养鸡十四只，种二分半菜园。在菜园里只要早、晚照顾一下，不但自己有菜可吃，每隔四、五天，还可以挑菜到集上卖四、五元钱。零花钱有多余，鸡蛋就卖的少，自己吃的多。生活比往年宽绰多了。
    夏永求，十六队的队员，中农，去年还在互助组。全家十八口人，有两人在外作工。全家除五个半劳动力外，有小孩十个。去年有田二十五亩，在互助组共收一万零四百斤稻谷，三百多斤山芋，十斤棉花。收的粮食，扣除牛工、水车费、种子及肥料等的费用，刚刚够吃，没有买油盐的钱。全家人多，光买油盐、火柴等日用的钱，一月就要五、六元。穿衣服的钱就更困难了。去年养十二只鸡，九月合伙买了一条猪，但随即卖出。今年全家养了两条猪，仍养十二只鸡。夏永求说，今年分的麦子不但够吃，还分到了现款二十元，跟着就又分早稻七百二十斤，收入不断，进多少就是多少，不用再扣除开支了。现在全家已得了四千五百个工分，一个劳动工分以二角一分六计算，今年到现在的收入，已经比去年多了一半。夏永求说，今年因为粮食够吃，有零用钱，连我这六十二岁的老头子和三个媳妇，都是越劳动越有精神。
    夏家福家里人多，劳动力少，只夫妇二人参加劳动，有五个小孩。去年在初级社的时候，两人共做了二百四十个劳动日，得到的收入合四百三十二元。今年夫妇二人参加劳动，到现在已得工分二千一百个，也已经超过去年全年的收入。去年家里没有养鸡鸭，只和别人六家合养一头猪。今年自己养了十只鸭，六只鸡。家里三个小孩上学，两个小孩送到托儿组，生活过得很快乐。
    夏光荣，是一个劳力少、土地多的户。去年没有入社。家里只一个老太太，就有六亩三分田，她的女儿在安徽医学院读书。去年全年共收二石麦子、十五石稻谷、五石山芋和三十斤棉花，另有二十四元的稻草钱。但是牛工、人工就用去八石稻；再扣去农业税等等，全年实际只得六石稻和二十四元的稻草钱。全年合计收入为八十元左右。今年，老太太一个人已得了五百个工分，现在已经能得到一百多元，比去年增加了很多。据老太太说，今年她还要争取再得二百个工分。
    篾匠夏永吉，过去串乡做活，一年只在夏收、秋收之前有两三个月的工作；每天除自己吃饭外，只能赚得八角钱。现在，在社里作农副业所需要的竹器，工作是经常的，如果竹器活少，立刻就能转到农业上去，农活一天的报酬比串乡的报酬还要高得多。现在，一年到头没有闲着的时候了。
    根据社务管理委员会在全社各队摸底，并且进行总的核算，全社今年共可收入六十万元，只要扣除20％，就足够生产投资、农业税、公益金、公积金、管理费用，其余80％都可以分给社员。这样，全社有98％的社员都可以增加收入。肥东县全县今年将有64％的社，能使90％以上的社员增加收入。
    这个社怎样做到了使98％的社员增加收入呢？他们的办法，一个就是在农业上进行切实的改革；另一个就是大大发展集体副业，同时扶植了社员们的家庭副业。
                ＊＊＊
    这个社是去年冬天由一百一十三户的初级社扩大升级成立的一千零二十户的高级社。全社耕地七千六百九十五亩，人口四千三百六十一人，每人平均一亩七分多田。去年在初级社的时候，每亩平均产量是五百八十斤；今年每亩产量将要达到一千斤。去年每人平均分到粮食八百斤；今年全年生产的粮食，预计每人可以分到一千五百斤，一年收的粮食够三年吃的。副业生产方面，去年除开粉房外，别的副业很少。办了高级社以后，经营的集体副业种类多，办得好，每个劳动日光从副业生产中就可以分到五角钱。
    在农业生产上，今年和往年不同的是：夏收作物小麦、大麦、油菜等的面积比往年扩大了一倍多；从来很少种植的早稻，今年种植了六百多亩。其中小麦产量平均比往年每亩提高六十斤，而早稻的收成则达到每亩平均六百一十斤。这两个大的改革，就使社员们的生活发生了很大的变化。过去夏收粮食少，从夏收到收中稻，农民都要吃大麦糊才能接上口粮；今年社员有了小麦、早稻，又早吃一月大米，把多余的麦子都卖给了国家。
    这个社靠着南淝河，去冬今春他们挖了一条沟，又整修一条旧沟，把河水抽到岗地上，就把一千多亩旱田改成水田，另外一千多亩过去不能保收的水田也能保收了。进行这个改革的结果是：全社早、中、晚稻的复种面积达到了七千多亩，等于全社耕地都种了一次水稻；过去只种一季中稻，水稻面积只占耕地面积的45％。往年吃不到大米的岗地农民，今年也都吃上了自己生产的大米。
    作物品种上的改革更是空前的。今年全社增加的优良品种有十三种。胜利百号山芋、岱字棉、胜利油菜和一些早稻、晚稻的优良品种，都受到社员们的欢迎。社员们不再像以前那样只是整天吃大米了，他们有了多种多样的食粮，吃的东西也就丰富起来了。
    这个社还从开垦荒地，合并田埂等方面，增加了四百亩耕地。有七、八十亩的耕地进行了土壤改良。地里的肥料也比往年上的多了。
    农业上实行了以上的改革以后，今年每亩粮食产量比去年要提高40％多。
    这个社的集体副业，在农民的收入中占着很重要的地位。在集体副业中对农业帮助最大的就是粉房；而收入最多的，却要算是养鸭子了。粉房加工一百斤豆子，就能得一百五十斤粉渣子和十五担粉水。粉渣子和粉水都是喂猪和喂牲口的好饲料。社主任赵庆华说，粉水把猪和牲口都喂得又肥又壮；去冬今春一百五十七头牛，都因喂粉水而长得肥肥的，没有一头生过病。粉水的肥效等于水粪，一亩水稻田只要二十担粉水，就能保证增产。今年就是因为社里有二十多盘磨磨粉，才把稻田的肥料上的足足的。没有粉水，复种所需要的肥料就要感到困难了。半年粉房虽然赚了不过万把块钱，但是它间接创造的财富却是很大的。社里今年设了孵卵房，用人工炕鸡、炕鹅、炕鸭子。今年已经炕出十二万只鸭子，除自养三万只以外，都卖了出去。全年光是孵鸭子、养鸭子的收入，就要达到五万八千元，占全部副业收入的一半，占全社总收入的十分之一左右。
    这个社还利用水塘，进行了三种副业生产。全社有一百口塘，养鱼十万尾，成活率以百分之六十计算，到年底，六万条鱼就可得纯利一万元；而原来鱼苗的成本才二百零四元。社里还有五十口塘的菱角，二十口塘的蕉瓜，现在长得都很好。这些副业，虽然是不需费多少成本就可以得大利的，但是过去受小生产的限制，从来没有能这样好好利用。
    此外，还有粮食加工和运输等副业，现在还在筹备开设砖瓦窑，为今年秋冬开展副业生产准备条件。
    全年集体经营的副业收入将达到十多万元，占农副业总收入的五分之一以上。
    只是今年上半年的副业收入，一般的户就都分到十五元左右；劳动力多的社员家里已经分到了四十多元。
    社里集体经营的副业，扶植了社员的家庭副业。社里在孵房炕出的鸡、鸭、鹅，很多都卖给了社员。社员家里每家都喂了二、三十只鸡，养鹅养鸭子的也很多。社里养了老母猪，可以繁殖小猪，又有粉房供应粉渣子和粉水作饲料，预计到明年就能做到家家养猪。社员中还有捉鱼虾、吊黄鳝的，也能增加一些收入。
    在群生农业社里，呈现了五谷丰登、鸡鸭成群的景象。老年农民夏永求说：“自古都说是
  ‘三山六水一分田，天下农夫耕不全。’可是今年我们不但消灭了空地，还多种了一季和两季庄稼，副业生产又这样好，生活怎能不好过呢！”
