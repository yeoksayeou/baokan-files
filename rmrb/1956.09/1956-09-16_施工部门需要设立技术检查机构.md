    Construction Departments Need to Establish Technical Inspection Agencies
    According to incomplete statistics from key construction units under the First Ministry of Machine Building, a total of 2,155 engineering quality accidents occurred in the first half of this year, including 124 major quality accidents, with rework losses amounting to approximately 69,000 yuan. Among these quality accidents, those caused by violations of technical operating procedures accounted for 42.7% of the total number of accidents; those caused by construction not according to drawings accounted for 23.7% of the total number of accidents.

    Why is this situation occurring? According to our analysis, the main reasons are: the construction departments under the Ministry of Construction Engineering have technical units that formulate operating procedures, and production units that execute operating procedures, but they lack technical inspection units to supervise and inspect the implementation of operating procedures; some units have them, but with few personnel, and they are not separated from the production units, so they do not play a significant role. In this situation, a series of tasks related to the inspection and supervision of engineering quality, the maintenance of process discipline and labor wage discipline, the economic analysis of engineering quality accidents, and the technical guarantee of qualified projects, lack specialized organizational structures to carry them out.

    Can the technical supervision departments of the construction units substitute for the technical inspection work of the construction units? Some construction units have said, "Party B (the construction unit) is responsible for construction, and Party A (the construction unit) is responsible for quality." But this is incorrect. For example, in equipment ordering, can the manufacturing plant not be responsible for quality, and instead have the ordering party be responsible? In fact, if Party A directly interferes with Party B's production activities, it will cause chaos on the site, which is detrimental to the work.

    We believe that in order to effectively guarantee engineering quality, the Ministry of Construction Engineering should quickly and universally establish technical inspection agencies from top to bottom. Of course, with technical inspection agencies, it is also necessary to mobilize the broad masses of workers to carry out regular mass self-inspection of quality, so as to check at any time and correct in time, and "prevent problems before they occur." However, as far as the Ministry of Construction Engineering system is concerned, the most important measure to ensure engineering quality at present seems to be the universal establishment and improvement of technical inspection agencies.　Zheng Zhonghua

### 施工部门需要设立技术检查机构

    施工部门需要设立技术检查机构
    据第一机械工业部所属重点建设单位的不完全统计，今年上半年共发生工程质量事故二千一百五十五次，其中重大质量事故有一百二十四次，返工损失约达六万九千多元。这些质量事故中，由违反技术操作规程而造成的，占事故总数的42.7％；由于不按图施工而造成的，占事故总数的23.7％。
    为什么会造成这样的状况呢？据我们分析，主要的原因是：建筑工程部所属的施工部门有制定操作规程的技术单位，有执行操作规程的生产单位，但是没有监督检查操作规程贯彻情况的技术检查单位；有的单位有，但是人员少，同时也没有同生产单位分开，因此起不到多大作用。在这种情况下，有关工程质量的检查督促、工艺纪律和劳动工资纪律的维持、工程质量事故的经济分析、合格工程的技术保证等一系列工作，就没有专门的组织机构来进行。
    是不是建设单位的技术监督部门，可以代作施工单位的技术检查工作呢？有的施工单位有过“乙方（施工单位）管施工，甲方（建设单位）管质量”的说法。但这是不正确的。譬如设备订货，难道承制厂可以不负质量责任，而要订货人负责吗？实际上，如果甲方直接干预乙方的生产活动，便会造成现场混乱，对工作是不利的。
    我们认为，为了切实保证工程质量，建筑工程部应该迅速自上而下地普遍建立技术检查机构。当然，有了技术检查机构，还需要发动广大职工，进行经常的群众性的质量自检工作，作到随时检查，及时纠正，“防患于未然”。但是，就建筑工程部系统来看，当前最主要的保证工程质量的措施，似乎还应该是普遍建立和健全技术检查机构。　郑仲华
