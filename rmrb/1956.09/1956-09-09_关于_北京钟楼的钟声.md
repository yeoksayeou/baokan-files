    About "The Bell Sounds of Beijing's Bell Tower"
    Tea Drinker

    "No coincidence, no story." This is the first time I've sat in front of the Bell Tower to rest and drink tea, and as I casually picked up the day's (August 25th) "Beijing Daily" from the tea table, I saw a line of text on the third page: "The Bell Sounds of Beijing's Bell Tower."

    Reading this short article while sitting here is truly interesting. The two lush green grape vines of "Lu's Teahouse" are laden with fruit; a small jujube tree serves as a natural support at one corner of the trellis. Beneath the green shade, several simple, old wooden tables are occupied by shirtless tea drinkers. This is a form of rest and enjoyment for the working people: they chat leisurely and sip their tea slowly, their demeanor so relaxed. I immediately fell in love with this place.

    All around, various vegetable and snack stalls emit enticing aromas. Not far away, the sounds of stringed instruments and drums from storytellers fill the air. Occasionally, young women in new clothes and "Young Pioneers" pass by on the small path. Turning around and looking beyond the trellis, ah, isn't there also a small cultural garden – a used bookstore stall? Within these mere dozens of steps, there is a marvelous combination of a small market, an entertainment venue, a cultural center, ancient palace pavilions, and the rustic charm of bean trellises and melon frames. I am contentedly enjoying the beauty of this old yet new Beijing city in the early autumn, with its wind, scenery, human affairs, and feelings. For a moment, I looked up again to gaze at the Bell Tower towering beside me, thinking of the drums in the Drum Tower and the exquisite copper clepsydra that are no longer there, but the copper bell in the Bell Tower still remains, recalling fragments of related legends and anecdotes. It was in this very situation that the line "The Bell Sounds of Beijing's Bell Tower" caught my eye.

    Yes, that one line of text was truly like a "bell sound," awakening me from my leisure and contentment.

    Oh, so the "Bell Tower" does have "bell sounds"!

    This is really nothing profound, and I can't help but find it amusing. But then I thought: hold on, I've known about the "Bell Tower" for a long time, so why haven't I ever heard the "bell sounds"? Aren't there quite a few ancient bell towers in the world that still emit moving bell sounds every day?

    The short article is written with great humor: the legend of "Golden Furnace Goddess" sacrificing herself to cast a bell to save her father, the method of striking the bell "tight eighteen, slow eighteen, neither tight nor slow another eighteen," when the Bell Tower was first built, when it was destroyed by fire, when it was rebuilt, the sound of the bell can travel forty miles on a quiet night... Interesting, and naturally makes you want to read it again.

    Today, the Bell and Drum Towers have become purely decorative buildings, but in the past, they played a significant role. In ancient times, there were no clocks, and people relied entirely on the Bell and Drum Towers for timekeeping.

    At this moment, I suddenly woke up as if from a dream, realizing. No wonder, I have always regarded it as a "purely decorative" thing, and I thought the Bell Tower was "naturally" mute. It stands tall in the northwest corner of the city, and although it has no use, its magnificent appearance is very "imposing"! Isn't this "purely decorative"?

    I recalled walking into the Bell Tower courtyard just now: it was empty and desolate, with four small sloping squares on all sides. Someone was sitting on the ground reading, but it was a desolate scene, with no flowers or trees to provide shade or amusement. A wooden sign reading "Beijing Film Technology Training Class" hung on the door, the doors and windows were old and dilapidated, locked with iron locks, giving a feeling of "decline." Looking through the glass door, the floor was covered with long benches lying haphazardly, and in front of me were several shoes, placed high on the table, covered with dust...

    I couldn't help but ask myself: besides utilizing it in this way of "Film Technology Training Class," can we think of better ways to utilize it? The ancient stone tablet in front of the door seems to be made of valuable stone, and the carvings are very exquisite. A group of children were climbing up and down. Although I have always been against guarding antiques too strictly, making them like divine mountains at sea, visible but unreachable, I feel that climbing around like this is probably not the best approach. Couldn't we add a small fence that opens and closes on time? Looking ahead, the tall iron bell cast during the Yongle reign of the Ming Dynasty stands in the open air. After hundreds of years of wind and rain erosion, the shaded side is already peeling off with layers of rust more than a tenth of an inch thick, making one think that in a few years, it will become a pile of scrap iron. Couldn't we build a simple shed or pavilion to at least prevent it from rusting due to rain? Aren't many precious ancient cultural relics often not considered strange by the people who see them every day, regarding the imperceptible wear and tear of time as ordinary, so that later generations cannot help but sigh in vain at a pile of "ruins"?

    In Beijing, there are so many historical sites like this that it is truly difficult to preserve and protect them all. It is sometimes impossible to take care of everything comprehensively, so let's leave it at that for now. Let's talk about "the bell sounds of the Bell Tower."

    Yes, in ancient times, people did not have clocks, and they relied entirely on it for timekeeping. What about today? Do all households have clocks and everyone has watches? "Aren't there standard clocks and broadcasting stations?" So, do they all run to the crossroads to look at the clock all day long? Impossible; as for radios, not every household has one.

    Yes, this "purely decorative" building once played a significant role—that was in the feudal era. Can it not play a "great" role, or even exert a "greater" role, in our great era?

    Suddenly, I seemed to see the neatly renovated Bell Tower. On the Double Ninth Festival, residents and tourists were leaning on the railings to look into the distance, celebrating the festival according to traditional national customs that the people love (this is also an indispensable part of the people's happy life). In my ears, I seemed to hear a loud, deep, and mellow bell sound emanating from the Bell Tower, spreading out melodiously. I seemed to see countless working people, housewives, children, students... all listening to this sound, vigorously going to work, getting off work, arranging work, and managing housework. I also seemed to see the grand scene in front of Tiananmen Square on major holidays such as "May Day" and National Day. At this time, the Bell Tower emits a sound that is louder and more beautiful than usual, with different rhythms, sometimes tight, sometimes slow, continuously striking, paying tribute to and blessing the motherland; people who are not in front of Tiananmen Square are also listening to this bell sound, their hearts excited and boiling...

    A tea drinker sitting next to me came to borrow a light for his cigarette. I woke up from my fantasy. I picked up the newspaper again, and the line of text, several large characters, was clearly: "The Bell Sounds of Beijing's Bell Tower."

### 关于“北京钟楼的钟声”

    关于“北京钟楼的钟声”茶客
    “无巧不成书”。我这还是第一次坐在钟楼前面歇腿喝茶，顺手从茶座上拿起当天（8月25日）的“北京日报”来，就看见第三版上一行题目：“北京钟楼的钟声”。
    坐在这里读这篇短文，真是大有意趣。“鲁记茶社”的两架碧绿的葡萄结得累累垂垂；架的一角，小枣树作了天然的支柱。绿阴中几张朴素古旧的小木桌旁，坐着赤膊的茶客们。这是劳动人民的一种休息和享受：他们款谈慢饮，气度那么悠闲。我立刻爱上了这个地方。
    四周各种各样的菜摊、小吃摊上，发出引人的香味。相离不远，就有鼓书艺人的弦索鼓板声韵传来。中间小路上不时穿过满身新装的姑娘和“红领巾”。转身一看架外，啊，这里不是还有一块小小文化园地——故书摊吗？在这区区几十步之间，却是一个小市场、娱乐场、文化馆、楼台殿阁的古迹和豆棚瓜架的野趣的一种奇妙的结合。我满意地享受着这个古老而又崭新的北京城的新秋风物人情之美。一时，又仰起头来瞻望高耸在我身边的钟楼，想着鼓楼里的鼓和精美的铜漏已然无存，钟楼的铜钟尚在，想起有关的传说和掌故的片段。就是在此情此景之间，“北京钟楼的钟声”那一行大字映入眼底。
    是的，一行字真像“钟声”一样，惊醒了我的悠闲和满足。
    哦，原来“钟楼”是有“钟声”的！
    这实在说不上是什么新发现的大道理，自己不免好笑。但旋即又想：且慢笑，我早就知道“钟楼”，为什么从来没听见过“钟声”呢？世界上不是很有些古老的钟楼，至今仍然每日发出动人的钟声吗？
    那篇短文写得很有风趣：“金炉娘娘”舍身铸钟救父的传说，“紧十八、慢十八、不紧不慢又十八”的击钟法，钟楼何朝始建、何时遭火、何时重建，大钟的声响夜静更深时可以远扬四十里……。有意思，很自然地要再读一遍。
    在今天看起来，钟鼓楼已经成为纯装饰性的建筑物了，其实它们当初原是起过很大作用的。古代没有钟表，老百姓就全靠钟鼓楼报时。
    我这时如梦方醒，恍然大悟。怪不得，我从来就是把它当作“纯装饰性”的东西来看待的，我还以为钟楼“天生”就是哑吧呢。它高耸在城北一隅，虽然没有用处，但是轮奂嵯峨，很有“气象”啊！这可不是“纯装饰性”是什么？
    我想起刚才走进钟楼院落里：空落落一片，四面四个斜坡小广场，有人坐在地上读书，却是一片荒芜，无寸花尺木可以遮凉娱目。门上挂着“北京市电影技术训练班”的木牌子，门窗敝旧，铁锁锁着，不禁令人有“零落”之感。从玻璃门往里望，满地是七横八竖的长凳子，迎脸陈列着的是几只鞋子，高高摆在桌子上，尘土未扫……。
    我不禁暗自发问：除了“电影技术训练班”这样方式的利用之外，是否还可想起更好些的利用办法来呢？门前的古碑，看来石质很名贵，雕琢十分精美，一群孩子爬上爬下。我虽然一向反对把古物拦得过于禁卫森严，令人如对海上神山，可望而不可即，但觉得这样爬来爬去恐怕也不是最好的办法。难道不可以加一层按时开关的小栅栏吗？往前看，露天里矗立着明朝永乐年代铸造的丈把高的大铁钟，几百年的风剥雨蚀，阴面上已然到处剥落着一分来厚的铁皮；使人想到再过些年，不免成为一堆废铁。难道不可以搭一个简单的棚子、亭子之类，起码使它可以避免雨水淋浸生锈吗？多少宝贵的古代文物不是当时当地日日看到的人不以为奇，把肉眼不易觉察的岁月磨损视为等闲，以致后代不能不空对一摊“遗迹”而徒兴慨叹？
    在北京，像这路货色的文物古迹真是多得保不胜保、护不胜护。一时不能全面照顾，也是有的，暂且不表。却说“钟楼的钟声”。
    是的，古时老百姓没有钟表，全靠它报时。今天呢？难道老百姓家家有钟、人人有表了吗？“不是有标准钟和广播台吗？”那么，都一天到晚跑到十字街头看钟吗，不可能；收音机吗，也不是家家有的。
    是的，这座“纯装饰性”的建筑曾经起过很大的作用——那是在封建时代。难道它在我们的伟大时代反而不可以起“很大”的作用、甚至发挥“更大”的作用吗？
    我忽然眼中似乎看到整齐一新的钟楼，重阳佳节，居民游客，在上面凭栏远眺，按照人民喜爱的传统民族风俗来欢度节序（这也是人民幸福生活中不可少的一部分），耳中似乎听到一种响亮、沉雄、醇厚的钟声从钟楼传出，悠扬地播散开去。我仿佛看到全城无数劳动人民、家庭妇女、儿童学生……都在倾听着这声响，生气勃勃地上班下班、安排工作、调度家务。又忽然似乎看见“五一”、国庆等大节日的天安门前的伟大场面，这时钟楼上发出比平日格外响亮优美的声音，和不同的节奏，忽紧忽慢，连续撞击，为祖国敬礼、祝福；不在天安门前的人们，也都耳听着这钟声，心中激动，沸腾……。
    一位隔座的茶客来借火点烟，我从幻想中醒来，我重新检起报纸来，一行题目，几个大字，分明是：“北京钟楼的钟声”。
