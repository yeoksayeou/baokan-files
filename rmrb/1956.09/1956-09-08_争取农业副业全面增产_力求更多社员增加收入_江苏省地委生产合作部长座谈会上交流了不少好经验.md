At the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee Production Cooperation Minister Symposium held not long ago, Jiangsu exchanged information on the increase in production of agricultural cooperatives and the increase in income of commune members, and discussed ways to strive for more commune members to increase their income.

In this year's summer harvest distribution work, about 80% of the commune members in Jiangsu Province increased their income, which is a great victory of cooperation; however, about 20% of the commune members reduced their income, which is a serious problem.

Since about 20% of the commune members reduced their income in the summer pre-distribution, this aggravated the task of increasing production in the autumn. The province suffered from typhoons after the summer disaster. The early rice generally yields 5%-10% less than expected, and the cotton buds fall off by about 20%. The loss of tall crops is even more serious. Based on the current situation and the experience and lessons learned from the summer distribution, in addition to quickly strengthening the operation and management of the cooperatives, doing a good job in the trial calculation of income distribution, and arranging for households that may reduce their income as soon as possible, we must strive for all-round increase in agricultural and sideline production.

According to the annual trial calculation of several cooperatives in different regions, in the first year of running a cooperative, production must be increased by more than 20% to enable more than 90% of the commune members to increase their income. For example, the Xintuan Cooperative in Dongtai, the proportion of production costs, public accumulation funds, public welfare funds, and management fees of the year, calculated according to the minimum limit, will still increase by 7.74% compared with last year; plus compensation for the reduction in income of those commune members who originally had more means of production and less labor due to the abolition of land remuneration, the annual production must be increased by 23% to enable more than 90% of the commune members to increase their income. According to this method of trial calculation, Yongxing Cooperative in Wuxian must increase production by 28.5%, and Xiangshan Cooperative in Tongshan County must increase production by 29%. Agricultural cooperatives cannot achieve such a large increase in production by relying solely on agricultural production. Only when agricultural and sideline production are fully increased can the requirement of a large increase in income be met.

Everyone believes that in terms of agriculture, emergency measures should be taken in response to the situation after the typhoon attack: field management should be strengthened, and crops that are not greatly damaged and can be salvaged should be immediately processed, weeded, topdressed, and disease and pest control should be carried out to increase the yield per unit area. Disaster-stricken areas should use early autumn crop land to grow more vegetables, radishes, etc. for famine relief; and continue to do a good job in flood prevention, drainage, typhoon prevention, and drought prevention, so that agricultural production will no longer suffer losses. Through these measures, in areas where the disaster is lighter or has not been hit, strive to complete or over fulfill the original plan; in areas where the disaster is more serious, strive to maintain production or reduce production as little as possible; in a few areas where the disaster is extremely serious and the autumn harvest is hopeless, we must also do a good job in production and disaster relief to minimize the extent of the disaster.

In terms of sideline production, the phenomenon of single production should be further corrected, and the following issues should be effectively resolved:

The balance of production and sales should be done well. With the development of sideline production, the problem of balancing production and sales is increasing, mainly because some products cannot be sold. For example, in July, the Zhenjiang area had 60,000 jin of peaches and 60,000 geese that could not be sold, and a large number of vegetables were stockpiled and rotted. If these problems are not solved, sideline production cannot be developed. The reasons for these phenomena are that some agricultural production cooperatives are operating blindly, but the main reason is that there are many unreasonable phenomena in market management. For example, some city vegetable companies neither allow agricultural cooperatives to enter the market for sales, nor can they take over the entire supply themselves. The main way to solve this problem is to carry out sideline planning in agricultural cooperatives, determine production based on sales, and plan production. On the other hand, we must strengthen departmental collaboration. Special areas and counties should quickly establish collaboration groups, and at the same time conduct research on market management and take different measures according to different situations.

Do everything possible to supply raw materials, feed, and livestock seedlings, poultry seedlings, fish seedlings, and tree seedlings. With the development of sideline production, raw materials, feed, livestock seedlings, poultry seedlings, fish seedlings, and tree seedlings are increasingly insufficient. For example, Liuhe County has many kang workshops, but it still lacks 240,000 chicken and duck seedlings; the county's Minsheng Cooperative planned to raise 10,000 fish, but only bought 4,000. An effective way to solve this problem is to rely on our own efforts, and we must start early. After Tongshan Shuguang Cooperative raised 150 sows, it can breed 1,000 heads by the end of the year. If it grows 1,500 mu of feed fields, it can solve the feed for the entire cooperative's pig raising.

Technical guidance should be strengthened. In some places, due to poor technical management, a large number of poultry and livestock die, and the phenomenon that processed products do not meet the specifications is very serious. An effective way to reverse this phenomenon is to select technical personnel to manage sideline production, and on this basis, carry out technical exchanges and short-term training. For example, the Hengtang Cooperative in Danyang collectively raised 6,000 chickens, and 5,000 died. The remaining 1,000 were fed by six people, and they continued to die. Later, they were handed over to a commune member who knew how to raise chickens, plus an assistant, and the two of them raised the chickens well.

While developing collective sideline production, we must vigorously develop commune members' individual household sideline production. According to the survey of 14 cooperatives, household sideline production accounts for a large proportion of sideline production, generally accounting for 50%-60% of the total output value of sideline production in northern Jiangsu; in southern Jiangsu, it also accounts for 30%-40% of the output value of sideline production. Judging from the current situation, many places do not pay attention to household sideline production, and there are still many restrictions. The key to reversing this phenomenon lies in educating cadres, so that they can recognize the benefits of developing household sideline production, and educate them to abolish all the many restrictions on the development of individual household sideline production. At the same time, we should provide strong economic support to poor commune members in difficulty. According to the survey, about 20% of the poor peasants have difficulties in developing household sideline production, and the cooperatives should support them. The Hongguang Cooperative in Liuhe County sold all 115 piglets bred in the cooperative to commune members in difficulty, ensuring that every commune member can engage in household sideline production, which is very good. In severely affected areas and cooperatives with insufficient financial resources, the state should also provide necessary support. In addition, we should also solve some problems between individuals and collectives, such as commune members' self-use land, feed land, labor arrangement, disposal of means of production, and the problem of poultry eating crops.

There are still many unreasonable aspects of the price policy for sideline products, which must be reasonably adjusted. For example, the purchase price of the best goose in Suzhou is 28 cents per jin, but it can be sold for 50 cents in Shanghai, which also affects the development of sideline production.

Local natural resources should be fully utilized to operate more sideline businesses that cost less and yield more. For example, Tongshan County's Xiangshan Cooperative focuses on developing pig raising, and grows its own pig feed. Each 200-jin pig can earn a net income of about 50 yuan. Dongshan Cooperative in Jiangning County makes full use of mountain land to graze calves, and each cow has a net income of at least 40 yuan. Because these two cooperatives have made full use of local natural resources, the cost of sideline production only accounts for 15% of the income. On the contrary, the Hongqi Cooperative in Dantu County burns lime, and the planned income is 24,700 yuan, but because raw materials and firewood have to be purchased from other places, the cost is 18,100 yuan. Because this cooperative did not act according to the principle of less cost and more income, the cost of sideline production accounted for 53.7% of the total income of sideline production.

Funds should be used reasonably and flexibly. Xingou Cooperative in Yancheng County needs a total of 1,500 yuan for autumn agricultural and sideline production, but only 600 yuan is left over from the wheat season. Therefore, it is necessary to first withdraw 400 yuan from the existing funds to operate some sideline businesses with small costs, fast turnover, and high returns, and then use the income to support other agricultural and sideline production, so as to solve the problem of lack of funds.

    争取农业副业全面增产　力求更多社员增加收入
    江苏省地委生产合作部长座谈会上交流了不少好经验
    本报讯　不久以前江苏省举行的各地委生产合作部长座谈会上，交流了江苏各地农业社增加生产、社员增加收入的情况和经验，讨论了争取更多社员增加收入的办法。
    在今年的夏收分配工作中，江苏全省约有80％左右的社员增加了收入，这是合作化的巨大胜利；但还有20％左右的社员减少了收入，这又是一个严重的问题。
    夏季预分中，既然有20％左右的社员减少收入，这就加重了秋季增产的任务。全省在紧接着夏季灾害之后，又遭受了台风的袭击，早稻一般要比预计产量少收5％—10％，棉花落蕾20％左右，高秆作物损失更为严重。根据目前情况和夏季分配的经验教训，除迅速加强合作社的经营管理，做好收益分配的试算工作，并较早对可能减少收入的户加以安排外，必须争取农副业全面增产。
    根据不同地区几个合作社的全年试算来看，在办社第一年，必须增产20％以上，才能使90％以上社员增加收入。例如东台新团社，今年的生产费用、公积金、公益金和管理费，占全年总收入的比例，按最低限度计算，还要比去年增加7.74％；再加上弥补那些原来生产资料较多劳力较少的社员因取消土地报酬而减少的那部分收入，全年必须增产23％，才能使90％以上的社员增加收入。按这办法试算，吴县永星社必须增产28.5％，铜山县象山社必须增产29％。农业社要达到这样大量的增产，单靠农业增产是不行的。只有在农副业全面增产的情况下，才能达到大量增加收入的要求。
    大家认为，在农业方面，当前应针对台风袭击以后的情况，采取紧急措施：要加强田间管理，对那些损害不大，可以挽救的作物，立刻加工、锄草、追肥、防治病虫害，争取提高单位面积产量。受灾地区要利用早秋作物土地，多种些蔬菜萝卜等，以备度荒之用；并要继续做好防洪防涝防台防旱的工作，使农业生产不再遭受损失。通过这些措施，在那些受灾较轻或没有受灾的地区，争取完成或超额完成原定计划；在那些受灾较重的地区，力争保产或尽量少减；少数受灾极重，秋收无望的地区，也要做好生产救灾尽量缩小灾荒的程度。
    在副业方面，当前应进一步纠正生产单一化的现象，并切实解决以下几个问题：
    要做好产销平衡工作。随着副业生产的发展，产销平衡的问题越来越多，主要是有些产品卖不出去。例如7月份镇江专区有六万斤桃子，六万只鹅卖不出去，大批蔬菜积压霉烂。这些问题不解决，副业生产就不能发展。造成这些现象的原因，有的是农业生产合作社盲目经营，但主要的是市场管理方面存在着许多不合理的现象。例如有些城市的蔬菜公司既不准农业社进入市场销售，自己又包不下来。解决这个问题的主要办法，一方面要在农业社中进行副业规划，以销定产，计划生产。另一方面要加强部门协作，专区和县均应迅速成立协作小组，同时进行市场管理的研究，根据不同情况采取不同措施。
    尽力供应原料、饲料和畜苗、禽苗、鱼苗、树苗。随着副业生产的发展，原料、饲料、畜苗、禽苗、鱼苗、树苗日感不足。如六合县自己有不少炕坊，但还缺少苗鸡苗鸭二十四万只；该县民生社规划养鱼一万尾，结果只买到四千尾。解决这个问题的有效办法是自力更生，而且必须及早动手。铜山曙光社自己养了一百五十头母猪以后，到年底就可繁殖一千头。自己种了一千五百亩饲料田，就可以解决全社养猪的饲料。
    要加强技术指导。有些地方因为技术管理不善，饲养的家禽家畜大批死亡，加工业产品不合乎规格的现象十分严重。扭转这种现象的有效办法是挑选有技术的人员来管理副业，在这个基础上开展技术交流和短期训练。例如丹阳横塘社，集体养鸡六千只，死了五千只，其余一千只由六个人负责喂养，仍然继续死亡。后来交给一个会养鸡的社员饲养再加上一个助手，二个人就把这些鸡养好了。
    在发展集体副业的同时，要大力发展社员个人的家庭副业。根据十四个社的调查，家庭副业在副业中占的比重很大，在苏北地区一般占副业总产值的50％—60％；在苏南地区也占副业产值的30％—40％。从目前的情况看，现在许多地方对家庭副业并不重视，清规戒律仍然很多。扭转这种现象的关键在于教育干部，使他们认识到发展家庭副业的好处，并教育他们取消所有限制个人家庭副业发展的许多清规戒律。同时，应在经济上大力支持有困难的贫农社员。据调查，大约有20％左右的贫农在发展家庭副业上有困难，合作社应加以支持。六合县红光社把社内繁殖的一百一十五头小猪，全部赊给有困难的社员饲养，保证每一个社员都能经营家庭副业，这是很好的。在受灾严重地区和财力不足的合作社中，国家还应该给予必要的支持。此外，还应解决个人和集体之间的一些问题，例如社员自用地、饲料地、劳力安排、生产资料处理、家禽吃庄稼的问题等等。
    副业产品的价格政策还有许多不合理的地方，必须加以合理的调整。如苏州最好的鹅每斤收购价格二角八分，到上海可卖到五角，这些也都影响到副业的发展。
    应当充分利用当地的自然资源，多经营一些花钱少收益大的副业。例如铜山县象山社抓住发展养猪为重点，自己种植养猪饲料，每头二百斤重的猪可净收入五十元左右，江宁县东山社充分利用山地放牧小牛，每头牛纯收入至少可有四十元。由于这二个社充分利用了当地自然资源，副业成本只占收入的15％就够了。相反，丹徒县红旗社烧石灰，计划收入为二万四千七百元，但因为原料、柴草都要从外地购买，所花成本达一万八千一百元，由于这个社没有根据花钱少收益大的原则办事，副业成本占副业总收入的53.7％。
    要合理使用和灵活调度资金。盐城县新沟社，秋季农副业生产共需资金一千五百元，但是麦季留下来的资金只有六百元，于是采取先在现有资金中抽出四百元，经营一些成本小周转快收益大的副业，收益以后再来支持其他农副业生产，这样，就解决了缺乏资金的问题。（附图片）
