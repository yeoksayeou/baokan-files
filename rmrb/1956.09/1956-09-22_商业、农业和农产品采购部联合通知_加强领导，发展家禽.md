Xinhua News Agency dispatch:

    The Ministry of Commerce, the Ministry of Agricultural Product Procurement, and the Ministry of Agriculture jointly issued a notice to vigorously develop poultry farming.

    The notice stated: Poultry farming is a rural sideline production with low investment and high and fast returns, and it is one of the ways to increase the income of agricultural production cooperatives and their members. Facts have proven that raising ten chickens (or ten ducks) can solve a family's miscellaneous expenses for a year. Poultry products are not only non-staple foods widely needed by the people, but also can be exported in large quantities to exchange for various construction equipment. For example, the value of egg products exported in 1955 could be converted into more than 6,000 tractors. This shows that developing poultry farming has important significance in national construction, and it is necessary to further strengthen leadership in this work, greatly increase poultry farming volume, and improve its product productivity.

    I. Actively organize members' families to raise poultry and agricultural production cooperatives to raise public poultry. Currently, some rural cadres and agricultural cooperative cadres believe that raising chickens and ducks harms crops and wastes food, and even restrict it. This phenomenon should be corrected. Make every effort to organize members to expand the number of poultry raised, and strengthen the feeding management of poultry to prevent damage to crops. Local agricultural departments should help agricultural cooperatives with the conditions to gradually develop public poultry farming, establishing poultry farms from small to large. In areas with rivers and ponds, more ducks and geese should be raised. In particular, large and medium-sized city suburbs and areas surrounding industrial and mining areas should be developed in large quantities with leadership and planning.

    II. In the past, when each household raised a small number of chickens and ducks, the feed problem for poultry was not significant. However, after the number of poultry raised is expanded, the feed problem must be properly resolved. Agricultural cooperatives must appropriately consider the feed grain needed for members' families to raise poultry in the distribution of harvest products. For specialized poultry farms and poultry farms in agricultural cooperatives that mainly produce cash crops, if they cannot solve the problem of concentrated feed themselves, local agricultural and procurement departments should contact the grain departments to strengthen the supply of commercial feed.

    III. Local agricultural departments should designate agricultural science research institutes or experimental farms (stations) to conduct local investigations, research, and breeding work on improved poultry breeds. At the same time, state-owned farms and ranches should be designated to breed high-quality poultry breeds to supply agricultural cooperatives with the needed breeding poultry and hatching eggs.

    IV. Local agricultural departments should actively train agricultural cooperative livestock epidemic prevention workers and members to master the technique of chicken inoculation, and the cooperatives should regularly organize inoculations. Livestock and veterinary stations should be responsible for universally promoting the inoculation technology of chicken Newcastle disease vaccine, supplying vaccines, and strengthening technical guidance for poultry production. In addition, chicks are prone to death during transportation. Localities should pay attention to studying and improving loading and transportation techniques and avoid overcrowding.

    V. Local commercial departments must urge the local food companies under their jurisdiction to actively strengthen and expand the management of poultry and master reasonable purchase prices to encourage farmers to raise more poultry.

    The notice concluded by saying that the autumn hatching season for poultry has now begun. Areas with autumn hatching conditions and habits should, in light of spring hatching experience, seize the guidance of autumn hatching work to ensure the realization of the original breeding targets for geese and ducks.

    商业、农业和农产品采购部联合通知
    加强领导，发展家禽
    据新华社讯　为了大力发展养禽业，商业部、农产品采购部、农业部联合发出通知。
    通知说：养禽是投资少，获利又多又快的农村副业生产，是增加农业生产合作社及社员收入的办法之一。事实证明每养十只鸡（或十只鸭），可以解决一户农家一年的零星开支。家禽的产品，不但是广大人民普遍需要的副食品，并且可以大量出口换回各种建设器材，如1955年出口的蛋品价值，可以折换拖拉机六千多台。这就说明发展养禽业在国家建设中有着重要的意义，必须进一步加强对这一工作的领导，大量增加家禽饲养量并提高其产品生产率。
    一、积极组织社员家庭饲养家禽和农业生产合作社饲养公有家禽，目前有些农村干部与农业社干部认为养鸡、养鸭伤害庄稼，耗费粮食，甚至加以限制，这种现象应该纠正。尽力组织社员扩大饲养数量，并加强对家禽的饲养管理，防止伤害农作物。各地农业部门应该帮助有条件的农业社逐步发展公有的养禽业，由小到大的建立养禽场，在有河流、池塘的地区应该多养鸭、鹅。大、中城市郊区和工矿区周围，尤应有领导有计划地大量发展。
    二、在过去每户少量饲养鸡鸭的情况下，家禽的饲料问题不大，但在饲养量扩大后，饲料问题必须适当解决。农业社在收获物的分配工作中必须适当照顾社员家庭养禽所需要的饲料粮，对于专业养禽场和以经济作物生产为主的农业社的养禽场，不能自己解决精饲料时，各地农业和采购部门应当和粮食部门联系，加强供应商品饲料。
    三、各地农业部门应该指定农业科学研究所或试验场（站）进行本地良种家禽的调查研究和培育工作，同时指定国营农、牧场繁殖优良品种家禽，供应农业社需要的种禽种卵。
    四、各地农业部门应该积极训练农业社的家畜防疫员和社员掌握接种鸡的技术，由社定期组织进行接种；应当责成畜牧兽医工作站普遍推广鸡新城疫疫苗的接种技术，供应疫苗，并加强养禽生产的技术指导。此外，运输雏禽容易发生死亡，各地应当注意研究改进装运技术，不可过于拥挤。
    五、各地商业部门，必须督促所属各地食品公司积极地加强和扩大家禽的经营，掌握合理的收购价格，以达到鼓励农民多养家禽的目的。
    通知最后说，目前已进入家禽的秋孵季节，有秋孵条件及习惯的地区，尤应根据春孵经验，抓紧指导秋孵工作，保证原定鹅、鸭饲养指标的实现。
