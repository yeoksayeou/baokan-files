Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, September 14th: News from Hong Kong: In the five days from the 3rd, when the Hong Kong British authorities reimplemented the "entry and exit balance" method, to the 7th, eight thousand nine hundred and seventy-two people went from Hong Kong to Guangzhou, while the total number of people going from the mainland to Hong Kong was only eight thousand six hundred and fifty-six. The number of people returning to the mainland was more than three hundred more than those going to Hong Kong.

A person in Hong Kong engaged in the travel business said that the "entry and exit balance" measure taken by the Hong Kong British authorities is unreasonable, and the claim that the number of people coming to Hong Kong is greater than the number of people returning to the mainland is unreliable.

A person in Kowloon in charge of neighborhood welfare work said that there is still no detailed and accurate statistics on the actual population of Hong Kong.

The Hong Kong British authorities' "Immigration Department," in order to ease the dissatisfaction of Hong Kong residents, issued a statement on the 12th saying: "Hong Kong residents holding identity cards and return permits are allowed to leave or return to Hong Kong at any time during the specified period, without restriction." However, according to reports in the local newspapers, some Hong Kong residents holding permits are still subjected to unexpected difficulties and cannot return to Hong Kong. A Hong Kong resident named Chen Furong arrived at the Luohu Bridge from Guangzhou on the afternoon of the 10th, but because she was carrying a son who was only a few months old, she was refused entry by the British police in Hong Kong. The British police said that the quota for infant entry was full and would only be allowed to enter Hong Kong when there was an infant entry quota. It is reported that there are currently about fifty Hong Kong residents holding Hong Kong "identity cards" in a similar situation who are stranded in Shenzhen and cannot return to Hong Kong.

    去香港的人少回内地的人多
    香港当局的借口破产
    据新华社广州14日电　香港消息：从3日香港英国当局重施“出入平衡”办法以后到7日为止的这五天内，香港有八千九百七十二人到广州，而从内地去香港的总人数只有八千六百五十六人。回内地的人数比去香港的人数多三百多名。
    香港一家办理旅行业务的人士说，香港英国当局采取“出入平衡”的措施是不合理的，所谓来香港的人数多于回内地人数的说法是不可靠的。
    九龙一位办理街坊福利事业的负责人说，香港实际有多少人口，到现在仍然没有详细确切的统计。
    香港英国当局“入境事务处”为了缓和香港居民的不满情绪，在12日发表一项声明说：“持有身份证及回港证的本港居民，于指定期间内，准予任何时间离港或回港，不受限制”。但据此间报纸报道，有一部分持有证件的香港居民，仍然受到意外的非难，不能返回香港。一个叫做陈芙蓉的香港居民，她在10日下午从广州到达罗湖桥头时，因为她背着一个出生仅有几个月的儿子，就被香港的英国警察拒绝入境。英国警察说，婴孩的入口名额已满，要等到有婴孩入口名额时才允许进香港。消息说，类似这种情况的持有香港“身份证”的香港居民，目前已有五十人左右被滞留在深圳不能返回香港。
