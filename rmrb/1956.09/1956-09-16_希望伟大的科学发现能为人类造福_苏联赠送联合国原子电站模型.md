Xinhua News Agency, September 15th: On September 13th, a grand presentation ceremony was held at the United Nations Headquarters, where the Soviet government presented the United Nations with a model of the world's first atomic power station. United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld presided over the ceremony.

The Soviet representative, Mr. Saksin, said at the ceremony that the greatest hope of all the world's people is to maintain peace, to be forever free from war as stated in the United Nations Charter, and to use atomic energy, the greatest scientific discovery, not for destruction, but to ensure conditions for peaceful creation and to improve people's living standards. Saksin said that the Soviet government has repeatedly proposed to the United Nations unconditional prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons. In the future, the Soviet Union will continue to strive tirelessly to reach an international agreement on the complete prohibition of the production, stockpiling, and use of atomic weapons.

Saksin then spoke about the Soviet Union's achievements in the peaceful use of atomic energy, how Soviet scientists have engaged in active and effective cooperation with their counterparts in other countries, and how the Soviet Union has effectively helped many countries develop nuclear physics research and train experts.

Hammarskjöld said in his reply that he was very pleased to accept the Soviet gift – a model of an atomic power station – on behalf of the United Nations.

    苏联赠送联合国原子电站模型
    据新华社15日讯　9月13日在联合国大厦举行了苏联政府把世界上第一个原子能发电站的模型赠送给联合国的隆重赠礼仪式。联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德主持赠礼仪式。
    苏联代表萨克辛在仪式上讲话说，全世界人民的最大希望是维护和平、如联合国宪章所说的那样永远摆脱战争，把原子能这一最伟大的科学发现不用于毁灭，而用来保障和平创造的条件和提高人民的生活水平。萨克辛说，苏联政府曾经一再向联合国提出关于无条件禁止原子武器和氢武器的建议。今后苏联仍将不懈地争取达成关于完全禁止生产、储存和使用原子武器的国际协议。
    萨克辛接着谈到苏联在和平利用原子能方面获得的成就，苏联科学家同其他国家的同行们进行了怎样积极有效的合作以及苏联怎样有效地帮助许多国家发展核子物理学的研究工作和培养专家。
    哈马舍尔德在答词中说，他很高兴地代表联合国接受苏联的礼物——原子能发电站模型。
