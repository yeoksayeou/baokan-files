China Educational Workers' Union National Committee Chairman Wu Yuzhang

(I)

It has been six full years since the establishment of the Chinese Educational Workers' Union.

In the past six years, our ranks of educators and scientific workers have expanded from over 700,000 in 1950 to over 2.2 million today, becoming a significant force in our country's socialist construction. They have cultivated a large number of construction talents for the country and have also contributed to raising the cultural level of the people.

In the past six years, our educational union's work has played a certain role in implementing the Party's policy of uniting, educating, and transforming intellectuals, and in helping teachers carry out self-transformation and improve teaching quality.

Educational and scientific workers nationwide have been basically organized. The Chinese Educational Workers' Union currently has 28,469 grassroots organizations and 1,351,134 members.

In order to raise the level of awareness of educational and scientific workers, educational union organizations at all levels have organized various visits and tours. In addition, they have assisted Party committees in mobilizing and organizing them to participate in past social reform movements, and have carried out relatively systematic political theory and current affairs policy studies.

In order to help teachers improve their professional skills, the union has collaborated with relevant parties to organize spare-time study classes, professional correspondence networks, and mobile libraries to help teachers pursue further education in their spare time. The union has also independently or jointly with administrative organizations organized experience exchange meetings, teaching seminars, teaching aid exhibitions, outstanding teacher representative meetings, and mutual assistance between new and old teachers to exchange and promote teachers' teaching experience. Based on the advanced experience of the Soviet Educational Workers' Union, the union has convened production meetings (this is a term translated from Russian; whether it is appropriate remains to be considered), which have played a positive role in mobilizing the enthusiasm of the masses, solving key problems in teaching and school management, and exchanging advanced experience.

In terms of welfare and cultural and sports activities, the union has also played a certain role. The union has reflected on and made suggestions to the government regarding some unreasonable phenomena in teacher salary and benefits, which has improved the situation. The teacher nurseries established under the active promotion of the union and the mutual aid savings societies under the leadership of the union have achieved good development. The union has also done some work in helping and urging administrative departments to rationally use welfare funds, improve the implementation of public medical treatment, improve cafeteria work, improve living conditions, improve the supply of daily necessities, and improve transportation. In recent years, some provinces and cities have made significant achievements in organizing summer recuperation for teachers. Some have even obtained a portion of beds in workers' sanatoriums across the country with the support of the Federation of Trade Unions, solving the recuperation problems of some educational and scientific workers. Teacher clubs and libraries are increasing daily, and "Teacher's Day" activities in rural areas are gradually being carried out, and various amateur art organizations are becoming more active. This year, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and some provincial and municipal federations of trade unions have successively allocated some money to solve the problems of teachers' cultural and material lives. The Zhong Sheng Sports Association of the educational workers' system is establishing organizations and carrying out work. In addition, the union has also carried out spare-time education work among employees and their families.

In the past six years, our work has achieved certain results, but there are also many shortcomings, some of which are even errors. We must face these shortcomings and errors realistically in order to effectively improve our future work.

The democratic life of union organizations at all levels is very unsound. The National Committee has not convened a congress on time in accordance with the union constitution. There is a fairly serious closed-doorism in the development of members. The union has not become a forum for the masses, allowing them to speak freely and exercise their democratic rights. The system of collective leadership and individual responsibility has not been established in a sound manner. This is one of the main reasons why the union organization lacks combat effectiveness.

The relationship between the union organization and the administrative department is not normal enough. On the one hand, many of the union's work cannot get the support of the administration; on the other hand, the union's due assistance and supervision of certain aspects of the administration are difficult to carry out, which greatly affects the development of the union's mass work.

The National Committee lacks regular and specific leadership over the lower-level unions, and its reports and requests for instructions to the Party Central Committee and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions are also infrequent.

Our union organizations, especially the National Committee, are not concerned enough about the various difficulties of the masses. We have both spoken less for the masses, and have not made good and full use of the money paid by the masses themselves and the state's appropriations for improving the lives of educational workers, and there are still phenomena of political discrimination against teachers, even violations of law and discipline, and arbitrary infringements on teachers' human rights in some rural areas. Teachers' labor is not respected, and any agency or cadre can call teachers around and arbitrarily dispatch them, resulting in teachers not getting rest, not having time for further study, and even being unable to teach well. We have not stood up to fight against this infringement of teachers' rights and have not played a good role in protecting the interests of the masses.

The reasons for the above-mentioned shortcomings and errors are mainly that our guiding ideology, work style, and work methods are seriously divorced from reality and the masses. We lack concrete analysis and research on the characteristics of educational and scientific workers, and the role and tasks of the union in schools and scientific research institutions have been unclear for a long time. In this way, when guiding work, it is inevitable that one-sidedness will arise because of starting from general rules. For example, because our understanding of "facing teaching" is one-sided, we only emphasized the aspect of exchanging experience, while neglecting the aspect of improving working conditions. The result is that the administrative department should do or the things that the union should not do have been done; and the things that the masses urgently demand and the union should do have not been done or have not been done enough. In addition, our work style is not in-depth, we do not understand the actual situation of the masses enough, and we have not relied on the wisdom and strength of the masses to solve their own problems. This is the root cause of the shortcomings and errors in our work. The comrades responsible for leading the work of the National Committee deeply feel that they have failed the Party and the vast number of educational and scientific workers' entrustment to us. This is what we should make a self-criticism and ask comrades to criticize.

(II)

The fundamental problem in China's education and science circles today is, as Comrade Zhou Enlai pointed out: "The strength of our intellectuals, whether in terms of quantity, professional level, or political awareness, is not sufficient to meet the needs of the rapid development of socialist construction." Therefore, the current task of the educational union should be:

Under the leadership of the Party, give play to the role of the union organization as a communist school, unite and educate all educational and scientific workers, raise their political awareness and socialist enthusiasm; mobilize and organize the masses to advance towards culture and science, improve the quality of education and the level of work; go deep among the masses, protect the interests of the masses from all aspects with tenacious spirit, and strive to help them create working conditions and solve various difficulties in life and study; oppose all bureaucratic styles of ignoring the hardships of the masses; continuously expand the ranks of advanced workers; effectively and on schedule complete the state's education plan and scientific research plan, and strive to improve the cultural level of the people, cultivate new forces for socialist construction, and to make our country's science and technology quickly catch up with the world's advanced level.

In order to ensure the completion of this task, the educational union must strengthen the following aspects of work:

First, cooperate with the administration and other relevant parties to widely and deeply launch mass professional work. The methods are:

1.  Convene production meetings, fully attract educators to actively put forward their opinions for improving work, overcoming the bureaucracy of leaders, and solving major problems in work; exchange advanced experience; mobilize the masses to check the implementation of the work plan in a timely manner, carry out criticism and self-criticism, especially bottom-up criticism; educate the masses to treat work with a socialist labor attitude, and cultivate conscious labor discipline. This is an effective way to attract the masses to participate in school management and complete teaching tasks.

2.  Organize the masses to make rationalization proposals. This can be done through various meetings of the union, suggestion boxes, blackboards, or other methods. This can not only give play to the masses' sense of responsibility as masters, but also closely connect leaders with the masses.

3.  Summarize and exchange advanced experience, and regularly commend, evaluate, and reward advanced figures. This work may not be promoted among teaching staff and researchers in universities and scientific research institutions, but it can play a good role in middle and primary schools. To do this well, the union needs to cooperate closely with the administration, care about the progress and achievements of teachers, summarize their experience, and regularly evaluate and reward (generally at the school level, once a year is appropriate). In the process of evaluation, it is necessary to prevent causing chaos and also avoid the method of designation from top to bottom.

To improve the professional level of educational and scientific workers, it is necessary to create the necessary working conditions for them. Although this is the responsibility of the administrative department, the union also bears a major responsibility. This includes work time, books, instruments, and work environment (and also includes the issue of assistants in universities and scientific research institutions). The role of the union here is: first, to go deep among the masses, collect opinions, and encourage and support the suggestions of the masses; second, to assist and urge the administrative department to improve some unreasonable systems, fully tap potential, and meet the requirements of the masses as much as possible.

Second, we must overcome bureaucracy and comprehensively care for the improvement of the material and cultural lives of the masses.

Educational and scientific workers still have the following serious problems in their material lives:

1.  The state has set up welfare funds for educational and scientific workers and implemented public medical treatment, which has solved many problems. However, the problems of old-age retirement, illness-related retirement, family medical care, multi-child subsidies, injury and death compensation, recuperation, and convalescence have not been resolved due to the lack of labor insurance.

2.  The problem of living difficulties has not been well resolved because the welfare funds have not been used well.

3.  There are still different degrees of "equal work, unequal pay" and "egalitarianism" in wages and benefits.

4.  There are still many problems in public medical care, housing, food, transportation, and living supplies.

What should the educational union do in the face of these problems?

Comrade Zhou Enlai once clearly instructed: "The staff of the union should go deep among the masses and use a tenacious spirit to solve various life difficulties for the members of their units. This should be an important task of various intellectual unions." In line with this instruction, we must actively play the supervisory role of the union. To this end, we must always care about the lives of the masses, understand the opinions and demands of the masses, and after research and analysis, promptly reflect the situation to the administration and other relevant parties, put forward specific suggestions, and urge their implementation. For example, supervise and assist the administration in running the cafeteria well, gradually solve the housing problem, urge cooperatives and bookstores to do a good job in supply, and suggest and supervise the health department to improve medical work, etc. For the phenomenon of discrimination against teachers, the educational union must, under the leadership of the Party, resolutely fight against acts that infringe on teachers' human rights until this phenomenon is corrected.

The union should actively assist and supervise the administration in making good use of welfare funds, and fully ensure that the money is used to solve the living difficulties of the masses, and is not allowed to be misappropriated or hoarded. It should actively study and carry out preparatory work for the implementation of social insurance. It should obtain the support of local trade unions and strive to allocate a portion of beds from sanatoriums and recuperation centers in various places for the use of educational and scientific workers.

The union should participate in this year's wage reform work (including private schools), and effectively cooperate with and supervise the administration in implementing the central government's wage policy and wage reform plan. First of all, it is necessary to organize the masses to study so as to give full play to the masses' supervisory role in this regard and fight against phenomena that violate the wage policy. At the same time, combined with this work, the union's mass wage work and its institutions should be established.

The union should strengthen the leadership of the mutual aid savings society in line with the policy of active rectification and vigorous development.

The union should also actively implement the "Instructions on the Work of Teacher Nurseries" issued by the National Committee and the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Higher Education this year, assist and urge the administration to work hard to run the nurseries well, and develop nursery organizations in a variety of ways in a planned manner, and strive to solve the nursery problems of more female teachers.

While caring for and striving to solve the living difficulties of the masses, the union must also carry out education on the socialist future to the masses, emphasize carrying forward the spirit of hard struggle, practicing thrift and overcoming difficulties, and criticize those thoughts that rely on the public for everything.

The union has a particularly important responsibility in improving teachers' cultural lives:

The union should actively consult with the administration and use existing conditions as much as possible to establish clubs; units that have established clubs should arrange various activities according to the requirements of different objects, oppose uniformity, and engage in simple work;

In rural areas, we should learn from the experience of the Soviet Educational Workers' Union and widely carry out "Teacher's Day" activities;

We should improve library work to make it convenient for the masses to read and borrow books; we should purchase new books according to the needs of the masses;

In areas where conditions permit, various amateur art groups should be organized, such as music, dance, photography groups, etc.;

Urban grassroots can also establish a ticket purchasing system (movies, dramas, etc.); grassroots far away in the suburbs can contact literary and art groups separately or jointly to perform at schools.

The union should also actively participate in the work of promoting Putonghua and carrying out spare-time education;

Widely carrying out sports activities is an important task of the union organization. In order to strengthen the leadership of mass sports activities, the councils of Zhong Sheng Sports Association at all levels should be established in various places.

Third, strengthen the political and ideological work of the masses and help the masses to further improve their political and ideological level by means of self-education.

Political theory study is an important way for intellectuals to conduct self-education. It is directly led by the Party committee. The union's responsibility is to assist the Party committee in organizing various lectures (including current affairs, policy reports, and academic lectures) and other auxiliary work. In addition, the union should also help the masses from all aspects, improve learning conditions, exchange learning experience, and reflect learning situations and problems to the Party committee as a basis for the Party committee to improve learning leadership.

Another important way for intellectuals to self-educate is to participate in the observation and practice of social life. The union must plan and vigorously organize the masses to conduct various visits, tours, and travels to expand their horizons, enrich their knowledge, and use this to carry out vivid communist and patriotic education to them.

Strengthen small group work so that small group meetings truly become a place for the masses to carry out criticism and self-criticism, where they can reveal their thoughts, realize comradeship-style mutual assistance, and achieve the goal of self-education. This requires that small group meetings can be held regularly (not necessarily often) and prepared.

Helping the masses to improve their level of awareness by means of self-education is by no means limited to the above few points.

The union must also think of more ways in its own work to give play to the role of communist schools through various mass concrete activities.

Fourth, strengthen organizational construction to ensure the victorious completion of the union's political tasks and various work.

According to the "Resolution on Strengthening the Work of Industrial Unions" of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the educational union must gradually implement system leadership in the next two years, which is a major task before us. We must take a series of measures to strengthen organizational construction work. The main measures are:

Actively develop membership and effectively correct the tendency of closed-doorism. It is required that the number of members reach 80% to 90% of the total number of employees by the end of 1957.

Establish and improve organizational structures. It is required that provinces, cities, and counties that have not held representative conferences or have expired according to the constitution should convene representative conferences and elect leading bodies in the next two years. The grassroots must universally convene membership conferences or representative conferences this year to summarize work and conduct elections.

Train cadres. In addition to the need to transfer in and promote among existing cadres to solve the cadres needed to implement system leadership, we must mainly strengthen training. Full-time cadres should be rotated off-the-job for training once within a certain period of time. For activists, short-term training or meetings should be used for all-round training. In order to adapt to the vertical management of finance and prepare for the implementation of social insurance, it is particularly advisable to replenish and train cadres in these two areas as soon as possible.

In order to strengthen the work of the educational union and realize system leadership as soon as possible, we must rely on the leadership and supervision of local trade unions to do our own work well.

In the future, union organizations at all levels must vigorously improve democratic life and implement the system of collective leadership and individual responsibility, and earnestly improve the work style that is divorced from the masses and divorced from reality. We must abide by the union constitution to elect on schedule, report work to the membership conference or representative conference on schedule, and must announce the accounts to the masses so as to put all the work of the union under the supervision of the masses. Leading cadres must take a certain amount of time to go deep among the masses, investigate and study, and guide work.

Finally, union organizations and every member must correctly play the role of mass supervision under the leadership of the Party. The purpose of supervision is to implement the policies and decrees of the Party and the state and protect the interests of the masses. Implementing supervision can attract the masses to care about the improvement of the entire work of the school, and is an important way to help the administration overcome shortcomings and improve work. Supervision, on the one hand, is to give effective help to administrative work on the basis of comrade cooperation; on the other hand, it is to carry out necessary struggles against the bureaucratic phenomena that violate the policies, laws, and regulations of the Party and the state and harm the interests of the masses. The content of supervision generally includes supervising the administration to correctly implement the state plan and wage system, correctly use the appropriations for improving working conditions and living conditions, implement meeting resolutions, and realize promises to mass suggestions.

(III)

Now our country is in the midst of a upsurge in building socialism. We must guarantee to the Party that we must highly give play to our enthusiasm and creativity, strengthen our self-transformation, and strive to complete the first five-year plan ahead of schedule and overfulfill it. We believe that on the basis of the achievements already made in the past and under the favorable conditions in the future, as long as all of us educational and scientific workers persist in unremittingly learning modestly, working hard, and dedicating all our strength to the socialist construction of the motherland, we will certainly be able to live up to the expectations of the Party and the people on us.

As long as our union work cadres correctly implement the Party's policies, are good at relying on the masses, and earnestly improve their leadership style, we will certainly be able to overcome shortcomings and further improve the union work.

In order to accelerate the construction of our great motherland, for our future life to be happier, and for striving for lasting world peace, let us unite closely and firmly around the Party and advance bravely along the path pointed out by the Party.

    充分动员和发挥教育工作者、科学工作者的力量，为伟大的社会主义建设服务！
    1956年8月6日在中国教育工会第二次全国代表大会上的工作报告（摘要）
    中国教育工会全国委员会主席　吴玉章
    （一）
    中国教育工会自成立到现在整整六年了。
    六年来，我们教育、科学工作者的队伍由1950年的七十多万人，扩大到了现在的二百二十多万人，已经成为我国社会主义建设事业中的一支重大力量。他们为国家培养了大批的建设人材，在提高人民的文化水平方面也作出了贡献。
    六年来，我们教育工会的工作，在贯彻党团结、教育、改造知识分子的政策上，在帮助教师进行自我改造和提高教学质量上，都起了一定的作用。
    全国教育工作者、科学工作者已经基本上组织起来了，中国教育工会现有基层组织二万八千四百六十九个，会员一百三十五万一千一百三十四人。
    教育工会各级组织为了提高教育、科学工作者的觉悟程度，曾组织他们进行了各种参观、访问，此外，还帮助党委动员和组织他们参加了历次的社会改革运动，开展了比较系统的政治理论学习和时事政策学习。
    为了帮助教师们提高业务水平，工会曾协同有关方面组织了业余学习班、业务通讯网、流动图书馆帮助教师们业余进修，工会也曾单独或会同行政组织过经验交流会、教学座谈会，教具展览会，优秀教师代表会及新老教师互助等，以交流和推广教师们的教学经验。工会根据苏联教育工会的先进经验，召开生产会议（这是从俄文翻译过来的名词，是否妥当，尚待考虑），在发挥群众的积极性，解决教学和学校管理工作中的关键问题和交流先进经验上，都起到了积极的作用。
    在生活福利工作和文化体育活动方面，工会也发挥了一定的作用。对教师工资待遇上有些地方曾有过不合理的现象，工会曾向政府反映，提出建议，使情况有所改善，在工会积极推动下成立起来的教工托儿所以及工会领导下的互助储金会，都有了良好的发展。工会在帮助、督促行政方面合理地使用福利费、改进公费医疗待遇执行情况以及改进食堂工作、改善居住条件、改进生活日用品的供应和交通方面，也都做了一些工作。历年来有些省、市在组织教师的暑期休养方面，有了显著成绩。有的还在工会联合会支持下，在各地工人疗养院中取得了一部分床位，解决了一些教育、科学工作者的疗养问题，教师俱乐部、图书馆正在日益增加，农村中的“教师日”活动也在逐步开展，各种业余艺术活动组织更加活跃。今年全国总工会及某些省市工会联合会都先后拨出了一部分钱来解决教师们的文化、物质生活方面的问题。教工系统的钟声体育协会正在建立组织，开展工作。此外，工会还在职工和其家属中进行了业余教育工作。
    六年来，我们的工作取得了一定的成绩，但也存在着许多缺点，有的甚至是错误。我们必须实事求是的正视这些缺点和错误，以便切实改进我们今后的工作。
    各级工会组织的民主生活很不健全。全国委员会就没有照工会章程按时召开代表大会。在发展会员上存在着相当严重的关门主义。工会还没有成为群众的讲坛，使群众能畅所欲言，实行自己的民主权力。集体领导和个人负责的制度也没有健全地建立起来。这就是工会组织缺乏战斗性的主要原因之一。
    工会组织和行政部门之间的关系不够正常。一方面工会许多工作，得不到行政的支持；另方面，工会对行政某些方面应有的帮助和监督也难于进行，很大的影响了工会群众工作的开展。
    全国委员会对下级工会缺乏经常的、具体的领导，对党中央和中华全国总工会的汇报、请示工作也很不经常。
    我们工会组织，特别是全国委员会，对群众的各种困难，关心得很不够。既少替群众说话，又没有把群众自己交的钱和国家为改善教工生活的拨款，很好地、全部地用到群众身上去，目前在一些农村里还存在着政治上歧视教师、甚至违法乱纪、任意侵犯教师人权的现象。教师的劳动不受尊重，随便什么机关，什么干部都可以把教师呼来唤去，任意支使，致使教师得不到休息，也没有时间进修，甚至无法把书教好。我们对于这种侵犯教师权利的行为，没有挺身而出，进行斗争，没有很好地起到保护群众利益的作用。
    产生以上这些缺点和错误的原因，主要是我们的领导思想、工作作风和工作方法严重地脱离了实际，脱离了群众。我们对于教育、科学工作者的特点缺乏具体分析和研究，对于工会在学校和科学研究机关的作用和任务长期不明确。这样在指导工作时，就不免因为从一般规律出发而产生片面性。例如由于我们对“面向教学”的认识是片面的，因此只强调了交流经验一方面，而忽视了改进工作条件一方面。其结果是行政部门应该作或并非工会非作不可的事情作了；而群众迫切要求又是工会应该作的事情，反而没有作或作的不够。加上我们工作作风不深入，对群众的实际情况了解得不够，也没有依靠群众的智慧和力量解决群众自己的问题。这就是我们工作中的缺点和错误的根源。我们负责全国委员会领导工作的同志，深感有负党和广大教育、科学工作者对我们的付托，这是我们应当作自我检讨和请同志们批评的。
    （二）
    当前我国教育界和科学界的根本问题，就是周恩来同志指出的：“我们的知识分子的力量，无论在数量方面，业务水平方面，政治觉悟方面，都不足以适应社会主义建设急速发展的需要。”因此，教育工会当前的任务应该是：
    在党的领导下，发挥工会组织的共产主义学校的作用，团结、教育全体教育、科学工作者，提高他们的政治觉悟和社会主义积极性；动员和组织群众向文化进军、向科学进军，提高教育质量和工作水平；深入群众，以顽强的精神从各方面保护群众的利益，努力帮助他们创造工作条件，解决生活、学习上的各种困难；反对一切漠视群众疾苦的官僚主义作风；不断扩大先进工作者的队伍；有效地按期地完成国家的教育计划和科学研究计划，为提高人民的文化水平，培养社会主义建设的新生力量，为使我国的科学技术迅速赶上世界先进水平而奋斗。
    为了保证完成这一任务，教育工会必须加强以下几个方面的工作：
    第一、协同行政和其他有关方面，广泛深入地展开群众业务工作，其方式为：
    一、召开生产会议，充分吸引教育工作者为改进工作，克服领导者的官僚主义和解决工作中的重大问题，积极提出自己的意见；交流先进经验；发动群众及时检查工作计划的执行情况，开展批评与自我批评，特别是自下而上的批评；教育群众以社会主义的劳动态度对待工作，培养自觉的劳动纪律，这是吸引群众参加学校管理和完成教学任务的一种有效方式。
    二、组织群众提合理化建议。可以通过工会的各种会议，建议箱，黑板报或其他方式来做。这样既能发挥群众主人翁的责任感，也能密切领导与群众的联系。
    三、总结交流先进经验，定期表扬，评选和奖励先进人物。这项工作，在高等学校和科学研究机关的教学人员和研究人员中不一定推行，但在中、小学推行可以起很好的作用。要做好这项工作就要求工会与行政通力合作，关心教师的进步和成绩，总结其经验，定期评选与奖励（一般以学校为单位，一年评奖一次为宜）。在评选过程中，要防止造成忙乱，也要避免自上而下指定的办法。
    要提高教育、科学工作者的业务水平，就应该为他们创造必要的工作条件。这虽然是行政部门职责分内的事，但工会也负有重大责任。这里包括工作时间、图书、仪器、工作环境等问题（在高等学校及科学研究机关还包括助手问题）。工会在这里的作用，一是深入群众，收集意见，鼓励并支持群众的建议；一是协助和督促行政部门改进一些不合理的制度，充分挖掘潜力，尽可能地满足群众的要求。
    第二、必须克服官僚主义，全面关怀群众物质文化生活的改善。
    教育、科学工作者在物质生活上还存在以下几个严重问题：
    一、国家为教育、科学工作者设置了福利费，实行了公费医疗，解决了不少问题。但年老退休、因病退职、家属医疗、多子女补助、伤亡抚恤、疗养、休养等问题，由于没有实行劳动保险，尚未解决。
    二、生活困难问题，由于福利费没有用好，还没有很好地解决。
    三、工资待遇上还存在着程度不同的“同工不同酬”和“平均主义”的现象。
    四、公费医疗、住房、伙食、交通、生活供应等方面，都还存在着很多问题。
    教育工会面对着这些问题，应该怎么办呢？
    周恩来同志曾明确地指示：“工会的工作人员应该深入群众，用顽强的精神为本单位的会员解决各种生活困难，这应该是各种知识分子工会的一项重要任务”。本着这一指示，我们要积极发挥工会的监督作用。为此必须经常关心群众的生活，了解群众的意见和要求，经过研究分析以后，及时地向行政及其他有关方面反映情况，提出具体建议，并促其实现。例如监督和协助行政办好食堂，逐步解决住房问题，督促合作社、书店做好供应工作，建议并监督卫生部门改进医疗工作等。对于歧视教师的现象，教育工会更必须在党的领导下，坚决与侵犯教师人权的行为作斗争，一直到纠正这种现象为止。
    工会应主动地协助并监督行政用好福利费，充分做到把钱用到解决群众生活困难上，不许挪用、积压，应积极研究和进行有关实施社会保险的准备工作。应取得地方工会的支持，争取从各地疗养院、休养所中拨出一部分床位，供教育、科学工作者使用。
    工会应参加今年的工资改革工作（应包括私立学校在内），切实协同并监督行政贯彻中央的工资政策及工资改革方案，首先要组织群众学习，以便充分发挥群众在这方面的监督作用，对违反工资政策的现象进行斗争。同时结合这一工作，把工会的群众工资工作及其机构建立起来。
    工会要本着积极整顿，大力发展的方针，加强互助储金会的领导。
    工会还要积极贯彻今年全国委员会与教育部及高等教育部发布的“关于教工托儿所工作的指示”，协助并督促行政努力把托儿所办好，有计划地用多种多样方式发展托儿所组织，争取更多地解决女教师的托儿问题。
    在关心和争取解决群众生活困难的同时，工会还必须向群众进行社会主义前途的教育，强调发扬艰苦奋斗、厉行节约、克服困难的精神，批判那些万事都依靠公家解决的思想。
    在改善教师的文化生活方面，工会负有特别重要的责任：
    工会应积极和行政协商，尽可能利用现有条件建立俱乐部；已建立俱乐部的单位，要根据不同对象的要求，安排各种活动，反对千篇一律，简单从事；
    在农村应学习苏联教育工会的经验，广泛开展“教师日”活动；
    要改进图书馆工作，使群众阅书和借书方便；要根据群众需要添购新书；
    要在有条件的地区，组织各种业余艺术团体，如音乐、舞蹈、摄影小组……等；
    城市基层还可以建立代购入场券制度（电影、戏剧等等）；远在郊外的基层，可单独或联合与文艺团体联系，到学校演出。
    工会还应积极参加推广普通话和进行业余教育的工作；
    广泛开展体育活动是工会组织的一项重要工作，为了加强对群众体育运动的领导，各地应把钟声体育协会各级理事会建立起来。
    第三、加强对群众的政治思想工作，帮助群众以自我教育的方法，进一步提高政治思想水平。
    政治理论学习是知识分子进行自我教育的一条重要途径。它是由党委直接领导进行的。工会的责任是协助党委组织各种讲演会（包括时事、政策报告和学术讲演）及其他辅助工作。此外，工会还应从各方面帮助群众，改善学习条件，交流学习经验，向党委反映学习情况和问题，作为党委改进学习领导的根据。
    知识分子自我教育的另一条重要途径，是参加对社会生活的观察和实践。工会必须有计划地大力组织群众，进行各种参观、访问和旅行，以扩大他们的眼界，丰富他们的知识，并借此对他们进行生动的共产主义、爱国主义教育。
    加强小组工作，使小组会真正成为群众开展批评和自我批评的场所，在这里能够做到透露思想，实现同志式的相互帮助，达到自我教育的目的。这就要求小组会能够经常开（不一定开的多），并有准备地开。
    帮助群众以自我教育的方法提高觉悟程度，绝不是只有上面说的几条。
    工会在自己进行的各项工作中，还必须多想办法，以便通过各种群众性的具体活动来发挥共产主义学校的作用。
    第四、加强组织建设，保证工会的政治任务和各项工作的胜利完成。
    根据中华全国总工会“关于加强产业工会工作的决议”，教育工会要在今、明两年内逐步实行系统领导，这是摆在我们眼前的一项重大任务。我们必须采取一系列的措施来加强组织建设工作，主要措施是：
    积极发展会员，切实纠正关门主义倾向。要求在1957年底会员人数达到职工总人数的80％至90％。
    建立和健全组织机构。要求省、市、县凡没有开过代表大会的或按章程逾期未开的，在今、明两年内召开代表大会，选举领导机构。基层必须普遍在今年内召开会员大会或代表大会，总结工作，进行选举。
    训练干部。解决实行系统领导所需的干部，除了必须调进和在现有干部中提拔外，主要还要加强训练。对专职干部，要在一定时期内离职轮训一遍。对积极分子，要采取短期训练或开会的方式，全部轮训。为了适应财务垂直管理及准备实施社会保险，尤宜及早补充并训练这两方面的干部。
    为了加强教育工会的工作，提早实现系统领导，必须依靠地方工会的领导和监督，才能把自己的工作做好。
    各级工会组织今后必须大力健全民主生活和贯彻集体领导和个人负责制度，切实改进脱离群众，脱离实际的工作作风。必须遵照工会章程按期选举，按期在会员大会或代表大会上报告工作，必须向群众公布账目，以便把工会的全部工作放在群众的监督之下。领导干部要拿出一定的时间深入群众，调查研究，指导工作。
    最后，工会组织和每一个会员，都要在党的领导下正确地发挥群众监督作用。监督的目的是为了贯彻党和国家的政策法令，保护群众的利益。实行监督可以吸引群众关心学校整个工作的改进，是帮助行政克服缺点，提高工作的重要方式之一。监督一方面是在同志合作的基础上对行政工作给以有效的帮助；另方面是对违反党和国家政策、法令和损害群众利益的官僚主义现象进行必要的斗争，监督的内容一般包括监督行政正确地执行国家计划和工资制度，正确地使用改善工作条件和生活条件的拨款，执行会议决议和实现对群众建议的诺言。
    （三）
    现在我们国家正处在建设社会主义高潮中，我们要向党保证，我们一定要高度发挥积极性和创造性，加强自我改造，为争取提前和超额完成第一个五年计划而奋斗。我们相信在过去已有成绩的基础上，在今后的有利条件下，只要我们全体教育、科学工作者坚持不懈地虚心学习，努力工作，把我们的一切力量献给祖国的社会主义建设事业，我们就一定能够不辜负党和人民对我们的期望。
    只要我们工会工作干部，正确地执行党的政策，善于依靠群众，切实地改进领导作风，我们就一定能够克服缺点，进一步把工会工作做好。
    为了加速建设我们伟大的祖国，为了我们将来生活更加幸福，为了争取世界持久和平，让我们紧密地、坚定地团结在党的周围，沿着党指给我们的道路奋勇前进。
