A group of Moscow sinologists and translators entered the television broadcasting studio. Gong Ting, First Secretary of the Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union, was invited as a guest to participate in the broadcast.

M. Vitasevskaya, Director of the Oriental Editorial Department of the Soviet State Literary Publishing House, introduced the publication of Chinese writers' works in the Soviet Union. She said that the Soviet Union is publishing a four-volume collection of Chinese ancient and modern poetry. A commemorative collection of Mao Dun's works, Zhao Shuli's novels and novellas, Guo Moruo's poems and plays, and works by many other modern writers have been published. Soviet readers are very fond of Lu Xun's works. In the past two years, the circulation of Lu Xun's works has exceeded 200,000 copies. The total number of books by Chinese writers published during this period reached more than 2.5 million copies.

Subsequently, translators L. Eidlin and L. Cherkassky recited poems by Bai Juyi, Qu Yuan and other poets.

Gong Ting greeted the Muscovites in Russian, saying that the great interest shown by the Soviet people in Chinese literature and the Chinese people in Soviet literature is one of the factors in the ever-increasing friendship between the people of the two great countries.
