Comrade Saifuddin, Secretary of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, spoke:

    I fully agree with Comrade Mao Zedong's opening address, Comrade Liu Shaoqi's political report on behalf of the Party Central Committee, Comrade Deng Xiaoping's report on the revision of the Party Constitution, and Comrade Zhou Enlai's report on the proposal for the Second Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy.

    Under the leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party, the people of all nationalities in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region are advancing victoriously together with the people of the whole country. After liberation, we victoriously completed the task of democratic reform, implemented national regional autonomy, achieved decisive victories in the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce, made great progress in economic and cultural construction, and achieved great success in Party building and cultivating local ethnic minority cadres. These victories have greatly enhanced the awareness of the people of all nationalities and unprecedentedly strengthened the unity of the people of all nationalities. The people of our region are fighting with full confidence to build a socialist society.

    Now I will only talk about the issues of Party building, national regional autonomy, and the cultivation of local ethnic minority cadres.

    (I) A Strong Team of the Chinese Communist Party Has Been Established in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region

    Comrade Mao Zedong instructed us: "In Xinjiang, it is necessary to establish a genuine Marxist party composed of local people..." The Party in Xinjiang resolutely implemented this task. Currently, more than 2,500 grassroots Party organizations have been established in rural areas, factories, mines, enterprises, government organs, and schools in our autonomous region. There are a total of 65,000 Communist Party members. In the past six years, the autonomous region has developed 34,024 new Party members, of which 27,833 (accounting for 81.8 percent) were developed from various local ethnic minorities.

    What are the reasons for such development of Party organizations in our region in such a short period of time?

    The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region is geographically adjacent to the Soviet Union. Therefore, the victory of the great October Revolution and the great achievements made by the Soviet people in building a socialist society after the October Revolution have had a broad and profound impact on the people of Xinjiang. The people of all nationalities who had been subjected to feudal exploitation and national oppression, after seeing the free and happy lives of the people of various Soviet republics, composed of various nationalities like themselves, geographically adjacent to them, could not help but develop deep feelings for socialist society and the Communist Party.

    During the historical period from 1934 to 1940, thanks to the help of the Soviet people and the hard work of a group of communists dispatched to Xinjiang by the Party Central Committee, led by Comrades Chen Tanqiu, Mao Zemin, and Lin Jilu, the cultural and educational undertakings and progressive ideas in Xinjiang were developed to some extent; a group of cadres with communist ideas were cultivated, which gave the Chinese Communist Party a good influence among the people of Xinjiang. In the process of the Three Districts Revolution struggle that broke out in 1944, a group of personnel with communist ideas who had undergone certain training also emerged. This revolutionary force that appeared in Xinjiang fought firmly with the people against the Kuomintang reactionaries, against the feudal system, and against imperialism, and achieved considerable victories. However, the experience of the struggle fully proved that without the direct leadership of the Communist Party, it would be impossible for the people to gain liberation. All these circumstances promoted the urgent demand for the establishment of the Communist Party in Xinjiang and created some conditions for it.

    After liberation, various tasks created good conditions for Party building. In accordance with the Party Central Committee's policy of "active and prudent" Party building, we developed Party members in conjunction with various tasks, especially the land reform and socialist transformation. Although it is somewhat difficult to quickly develop Party organizations in Xinjiang, where the number of workers is small, the facts have proved that it is possible and correct to develop a large number of Party members from laboring peasants, intellectuals, and other working people who have been tempered in the class struggle during the land reform and socialist transformation struggles.

    Although we have made great achievements in Party building, judging from the arduous tasks of the autonomous region in the future, the achievements we have made in Party building are still far from enough. In the future, we must strengthen Party building in accordance with the Party Central Committee's policy of active and prudent Party building, complete the task of establishing Party branches in every township by the end of this year and developing 55,000 new Party members in the next two years, expand the Party's ranks, and strengthen the Party's strength.

    (II) National Regional Autonomy Has Been Successfully Implemented in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region

    National regional autonomy is an important method for solving national problems based on Marxist-Leninist theory. This has been proven by many historical experiences, including the experience of the past few years after the national liberation. Therefore, this experience has been affirmed in the Constitution in the form of law. After liberation, new content was added to the way national issues were raised in China. Now, the issue of nationalities is no longer the issue of eliminating national oppression and striving for political equality among all nationalities (this issue was resolved when the People's Republic of China was founded), but rather the issue of consolidating mutual cooperation and unity among all nationalities and truly realizing de facto equality among all nationalities. And consolidating national unity and realizing de facto equality—raising backward nationalities from the economic and cultural level to the level of advanced nationalities—requires a long period of arduous work. This is the basic direction of the Party's nationality policy. It is clear that promoting national regional autonomy is an important and indispensable way to achieve this direction.

    The work of promoting national regional autonomy in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, like other tasks, has achieved great success. There are thirteen nationalities living in the autonomous region, including Uyghur, Kazakh, Han, Hui, Kirgiz, Mongolian, Russian, Tajik, Tatar, Uzbek, Xibe, Daur, and Manchu. Among them, seven nationalities (accounting for more than 85 percent of the total population) believe in Islam. In Xinjiang, six autonomous counties and five autonomous prefectures have been established according to the distribution of various nationalities. The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region was formally established on October 1, 1955. Our region's work in promoting national regional autonomy did not begin after liberation, but after the completion of the land reform. In this way, we were able to have sufficient time to carry out a series of ideological work on promoting national regional autonomy; on the other hand, we were able to victoriously carry out land reform, eliminate feudal forces and the landlord class, establish the political advantage of the working people, and cultivate local ethnic minority cadres. This created conditions for us to promote national regional autonomy and to equip a large number of cadres from working people to participate in the work of autonomous organs at all levels.

    The experience of our region in promoting national regional autonomy proves that for a considerable period of time before the implementation of national regional autonomy, ideological work must be fully carried out for the people, especially the broad masses of cadres. Without ideological unity, this work cannot be carried out smoothly. Before the implementation of national regional autonomy, some people in Xinjiang also proposed the establishment of union republics or autonomous republics. These opinions were not in line with the specific conditions of our country. Therefore, discussions and studies were conducted within and outside the Party for a considerable period of time to make everyone realize that only the implementation of national regional autonomy is in line with the specific conditions of our country. At the same time, appropriate criticisms and corrections were made to some wrong opinions. In addition, counter-revolutionary elements spread rumors saying that "Xinjiang is going to establish an independent East Turkestan government," and so on. However, these rumors have been resolutely cracked down on by the people who realize that this is only beneficial to imperialism.

    The implementation of national regional autonomy is a historical and huge victory in the lives of the people of all nationalities in our region. This victory is due to the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the hard work of the people of all nationalities, and the sincere help of the Han working people and Han Communist Party members.

    Although we have successfully implemented national regional autonomy, we still need to carry out many specific tasks in order to thoroughly realize the right to autonomy, strengthen and consolidate the unity of the people of all nationalities, and realize de facto equality among all nationalities. Based on our experience, we must pay close attention to the following points:

    (1) Party organizations at all levels in ethnic minority areas must fully take into account the characteristics of the region when deploying and implementing overall work and daily work. Ignoring this point will lead to errors in the work.

    (2) Constantly strive to win and strengthen the unity of the working people of all nationalities in the region, and constantly struggle against various tendencies that hinder national unity. The unity of the working people of all nationalities can be achieved in the democratic reform movement, in the socialist transformation, and on the production front. Such unity is the true unity based on class cooperation—internationalist unity. If this unity, which is the core of great national unity, is not established, it is impossible to win and consolidate true national unity. In this regard, cultivating a large number of workers from ethnic minorities—the proletariat of that nationality—is the most important issue.

    The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region already has this core of national unity. The tens of thousands of workers of all nationalities who are emerging are helping each other and working shoulder to shoulder with Han workers on the same lathe, in the same mine, that is, on the same front of socialist industrialization. Their will and destiny are consistent, and their future is the same. Tens of thousands of laboring peasants of all nationalities are also fighting on the production front in order to carry out socialist agricultural production.

    (3) To implement national regional autonomy in name and in fact, do not think that the establishment of national regional autonomous organizations is equivalent to completing all the work of national regional autonomy. After the establishment of national regional autonomous organizations, it is necessary to fully realize the autonomous rights of autonomous areas; it is necessary to actively discover, understand, and satisfactorily solve the demands of various nationalities; it is necessary to make ethnic minorities personally experience that they are the masters of their own affairs, so as to promote them to consciously and actively participate in the work of the region and the entire country; it is necessary to make them realize that they are not only the masters of the region, but also the masters of the country; it is necessary to make them love the country and the people of the whole country wholeheartedly as they love their hometown and their own nation. Only in this way can we give full play to the enthusiasm of the people of ethnic minorities and further promote their patriotism and internationalism.

    (4) Developing a culture with national forms and socialist content has a great role in realizing de facto equality among all nationalities. The key to this work lies in vigorously developing the cultural and educational undertakings in ethnic minority areas. Therefore, it is necessary to actively overcome difficulties and create conditions for this.

    (5) The financial authority of the autonomous region should be appropriately divided; at the same time, in order to develop the financial and economic work of the autonomous region, the central government needs to provide greater material and technical assistance for the development of industry, especially local industry, the reclamation of wasteland, and the development of agricultural and pastoral production.

    It is of great significance to develop commerce in a way that is suitable for the specific conditions of ethnic minority areas and to implement price policies well, so as to appropriately adjust the ratio between agricultural and pastoral products and industrial products. It is of great significance for the state to carry out various constructions in ethnic minority areas to promote the development of the region, but when the central ministries plan and arrange these industrial constructions, and in the specific implementation process, they should take into account the various difficulties in these areas and establish close contact with the autonomous region in terms of transportation, building materials, and labor, so as to understand the situation and appropriate planning is very necessary.

    (III) A Large Number of Local Ethnic Minority Cadres Have Been Cultivated in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region

    In ethnic minority areas, it is necessary to cultivate a large number of local ethnic minority cadres and carry out work through them in order to smoothly carry out all aspects of work. The Party organization in Xinjiang has always attached importance to this important work. The work of cultivating local ethnic minority cadres has achieved great success in the past seven years. At present, there are more than 100,000 cadres working in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, of which more than 50,000 are local ethnic minority cadres. Some of them came from the former Fifth Army, some of them participated in the work in the past and were educated and transformed, and most of them were newly cultivated after liberation. There are more than 3,000 ethnic minority cadres who hold leadership positions above the district head. More than 40 percent of the members of Party committees at all levels above the district committee are ethnic minority cadres, and there are also many ethnic minority cadres who hold the positions of ministers and secretaries of Party committees at all levels. A large number of technical cadres are being trained in factories, mines, enterprises, agricultural departments, schools, and in practical work. Under the leadership of the Party, all these ethnic minority cadres, together with Han cadres, and relying on their help, play a great role in all aspects of work. Most of these cadres have been educated and trained in various democratic reforms and in practical work. However, the existing cadres are still far from enough. Many important and arduous tasks are placed before us in terms of cadre training. In the next six or seven years, an average of more than 50,000 cadres need to be trained each year. This is one of our basic tasks at present.

    Based on our experience, the following points should be paid attention to in cultivating ethnic minority cadres:

    (1) Cultivate cadres in practical work. Strengthen mutual assistance and cooperation among cadres. Those who understand should teach those who do not understand. Cadres should be boldly cultivated and promoted; the attitude of "only promoting, not cultivating" is wrong. The advantages of ethnic minority cadres should be developed, and they should be helped to overcome their mistakes and shortcomings in a timely manner, and they should be given convenient working conditions, mainly to enable ethnic minority cadres to work in their own language in the organs; without appropriate working conditions, even if they are promoted, it is difficult to further improve and play their role. That is to say, the principle that ethnic minority cadres have the right and the responsibility should be fully implemented. But at the same time, it should also be emphasized that there is responsibility with the position. If some ethnic minority cadres ignore their responsibilities, that is, ignore or are not loyal to the cause of the people; if the work is damaged as a result, or even blame others or Han cadres for the bad consequences caused by their own mistakes, it is a great mistake.

    (2) Cadres of all nationalities must learn each other's languages. It is very important for ethnic minority cadres to learn Chinese. In the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, we believe that Chinese courses should be added to schools above junior high school, and ethnic minority students graduating from high school should be required to reach or basically reach the level of being able to understand Chinese lectures in Han colleges. It is not yet possible to make such requirements in all places. But such requirements must be emphasized and gradually reached. Without this, it is impossible to cultivate senior specialized talents of ethnic minorities and develop their culture and education. How can ethnic minorities who do not yet have universities, or even middle schools, be able to establish universities teaching in their own languages in a short period of time? Do we have to wait for such schools to appear before we can train cadres? If you wait, you will have neither this nor that. But this does not mean that the languages ​​of ethnic minorities can be disrespected. We should respect the languages ​​of ethnic minorities very well and use them as weapons. Primary and secondary schools must be developed in the languages ​​of their respective ethnic groups. The political and legal departments must use the languages ​​of local ethnic groups. But to reach an advanced level in science and technology, it is impossible to solve the problem only by using the languages ​​of their own ethnic groups. For this reason, only by learning from advanced ethnic groups can this goal be achieved.

    (3) It is necessary to strengthen the unity among cadres, especially the unity between local ethnic minority cadres and Han cadres. This is one of the main keys to the successful conduct of work in ethnic minority areas. There is a saying in Uyghur: "The older brother respects the younger brother, and the younger brother repays the older brother." Now, Han cadres not only respect ethnic minorities, but also overcome many difficulties and hardships, and serve ethnic minorities wholeheartedly. It would be somewhat unfair if the selfless spirit of Han cadres was not praised. The relationship between Han cadres and local ethnic minority cadres must be a relationship between brothers and a relationship between teachers and apprentices. Han cadres must strive to educate and help local ethnic minority cadres, and local ethnic minority cadres should strive to learn and work hard, and should express their gratitude to them. The unity and comradely friendship established and strengthened through these will be unbreakable.

    (IV) The Majority Nationality Should Continuously Send Corresponding Cadres to Work in Ethnic Minority Areas

    This is required by the progress and development of the people of all ethnic minorities. This will not only not affect the people of ethnic minorities' being the masters of their own affairs, but it is also necessary for them to manage their own affairs well. This is also very necessary in terms of helping to train ethnic minority cadres. It would be completely wrong to understand the phrase "nationalizing organs" as purely independently managing one's own business by cadres of one's own nationality. This view is the most prominent local nationalism tendency. Of course, this tendency cannot be allowed to exist. In the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, a large number of cadres of all nationalities have been trained and continue to be trained, and there are also many Han cadres working in Xinjiang. In the future, it will be necessary to continue to transfer Han cadres from the interior, especially specialized talents in science, technology, culture, education, and health, to work in the autonomous region. In order to train local ethnic minority cadres in the above-mentioned departments, many Han senior intellectuals are especially needed. In terms of labor, we need continuous support from the interior. Some departments are currently feeling the lack of labor. In the future large-scale economic construction period, in addition to giving full play to the effectiveness of local labor, tens of thousands of labor forces are also needed. It is known to everyone that we cannot completely solve this difficulty by ourselves. This requires a large number of labor forces supported by the interior. We hope that the relevant departments of the Central Committee will take care of our above two requirements.

    (V) Whether it is great-Han chauvinism or local nationalism, in essence, it belongs to bourgeois ideology. We must overcome this non-proletarian ideology that violates the wishes of the people of all nationalities.

    It is necessary to strengthen proletarian communist education among cadres of all nationalities. This is an arduous task that requires a considerable period of time and requires various educational measures. The responsible Party member cadres of all nationalities must pay special attention to this work. In the struggle against the above-mentioned two nationalistic ideologies or these two nationalistic tendencies, one must never tolerate serious mistakes for the sake of accommodation. However, at the same time, attention should also be paid to avoiding the phenomenon of easily putting the hat of great-Han chauvinism or local nationalism on cadres for some general problems in the work without careful study. These phenomena must be overcome and prevented.

    In the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, while opposing great-Han chauvinism tendencies among the Han nationality, it is also necessary to oppose great-nationality chauvinism among the Uyghur nationality towards other ethnic minorities. Among cadres, it is necessary to continuously strengthen education on nationality policies. We must carry out a relentless struggle against all bourgeois nationalist ideologies that harm the interests of the people and the unity of the country, and against all conspiracies that serve the interests of imperialism. We must resolutely crack down on and crush them.

    The above are the main achievements and practical experiences of the Party's work in the Xinjiang region in the past few years.

    We will never forget that there are more and more complex tasks before us. We firmly believe that these tasks will definitely be realized. We firmly believe that the people of all nationalities in Xinjiang and the people of the whole country will definitely be able to successfully build a socialist society together.

    新疆维吾尔自治区各族人民同全国人民一道胜利地前进着
    中共新疆维吾尔自治区委员会书记　赛福鼎同志的发言
    我完全同意毛泽东同志的开幕词、刘少奇同志代表党中央所作的政治报告、邓小平同志关于修改党章的报告和周恩来同志关于发展国民经济的第二个五年计划的建议的报告。
    在伟大的中国共产党的领导下，新疆维吾尔自治区各族人民同全国人民一道胜利地前进着。解放后，我们胜利地完成了民主改革的任务，实行了民族区域自治，对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造已取得决定性的胜利，经济文化建设事业已得到了很大的发展，党的建设和培养本地民族干部获得了很大的成就。这些胜利，大大提高了各族人民的觉悟程度，空前地加强了各族人民的团结。我区人民正在满怀信心地为建设社会主义社会而奋斗着。
    现在我只讲讲党的建设、民族区域自治和培养本地民族干部问题。
    （一）在新疆维吾尔自治区已经有了中国共产党的坚强的队伍
    毛泽东同志指示我们：“在新疆必须建立起由本地人组成的真正的马克思主义的党……”新疆地区的党，坚决执行了这个任务。目前在我自治区农村中，工厂矿山企业中，机关和学校中建立了二千五百多个党的基层组织。共有六万五千名共产党员，六年来自治区发展了三万四千零二十四名新党员，其中二万七千八百三十三名（占百分之八一·八）是从本地各少数民族中发展的。
    我区在短短的时间内，党的组织能有这样的发展是什么原因呢？
    新疆维吾尔自治区在地理上和苏联毗连，因此，伟大的十月革命的胜利和十月革命以后，苏联人民在建设社会主义社会的事业中所取得的伟大胜利，给了新疆人民以广泛的和深刻的影响。曾经受过封建剥削和民族压迫的各族人民，看到了地理上相邻的，由和他们自己一样的各民族组成的各个苏维埃共和国人民的自由、幸福的生活以后，他们不能不对社会主义社会、对共产党产生深厚的感情。
    从一九三四年到一九四○年的历史时期内，由于苏联人民的帮助，由于党中央派到新疆工作的以陈潭秋、毛泽民和林基路等同志为首的一批共产党人的努力工作，使新疆的文化教育事业和进步思想有所发展；培养了一批具有共产主义思想的干部，使中国共产党在新疆人民群众中有了良好的影响。在一九四四年爆发的三区革命斗争过程中，也涌现出一批经过一定锻炼的具有共产主义思想的人员。在新疆出现的这一批革命力量同人民在一起进行了反对国民党反动派、反对封建制度和帝国主义的坚强的斗争，取得了相当大的胜利。但是斗争的经验充分证明：没有共产党的直接领导，就不可能使人民获得解放。所有这些情况促成了在新疆建立共产党的迫切要求，并为此创造了一些条件。
    解放后经过各种工作为建党创造了很好的条件。我们根据党中央“积极、慎重”的建党方针，结合各项工作，尤其是土地改革和社会主义改造工作，发展了党员。在工人人数很少的新疆地区，要很快地发展党的组织，虽然有些困难，但是，事实证明，在土地改革和社会主义改造斗争中，在经过阶级斗争锻炼的劳动农民、知识分子和其他劳动人民中大量发展党员，是可能的，我们这样作也是正确的。
    我们在建党工作上虽取得很大的成就，但是从自治区今后的繁重的任务来估计，我们在建党方面所取得的成绩还是很不够的。今后必须根据党中央积极、慎重的建党方针，加强建党工作，完成今年年底乡乡建立党的支部和今明两年发展五万五千名新党员的任务，扩大党的队伍，加强党的力量。
    （二）在新疆维吾尔自治区胜利地实行了民族区域自治
    民族区域自治是根据马克思列宁主义学说解决民族问题的重要办法，这是经过许多历史经验包括全国解放后几年来的经验所证明了的。因此，这个经验以法律的形式，被肯定在宪法中。解放以后中国民族问题的提法上增加了新的内容，现在民族的问题，不是消灭民族压迫和争取各民族政治上的平等的问题（这个问题在中华人民共和国成立时就已得到了解决），而是巩固各民族互相合作和团结，切实实现各民族事实上的平等的问题了。而巩固民族团结和实现事实上的平等——使落后的民族从经济上文化上提高到先进民族的水平，这是需要很长时间的艰苦工作。这是党的民族政策的基本方向。很明显，推行民族区域自治是达到这个方向的重要而不可缺少的一个办法。
    新疆维吾尔自治区推行民族区域自治的工作，和其他各项工作一样获得了很大的成就。生活在自治区的有维吾尔、哈萨克、汉族、回族、柯尔克孜、蒙古族、俄罗斯、塔吉克、塔塔尔、乌孜别克、锡伯、达呼尔、满族等十三个民族。其中七个民族（占总人口百分之八十五多）是信仰伊斯兰教。在新疆按照各个民族聚居的情况已经成立了六个自治县、五个自治州，一九五五年十月一日正式成立了新疆维吾尔自治区。我区推行民族区域自治的工作不是解放以后就开始的，而是土地改革完成以后，开始进行的。这样，我们就一方面能够有充分的时间进行关于推行民族区域自治的一系列的思想工作；另一方面就能够胜利地进行土地改革，消灭封建势力和地主阶级，树立劳动人民群众的政治上的优势，并培养出本地民族干部。这样，就为我们推行民族区域自治，为配备大批劳动人民出身的干部参加各级自治机关的工作，创造了条件。
    我区推行民族区域自治工作的经验证明，在推行民族区域自治之前的一个相当长的时期内，对于人民群众，尤其是广大干部必须充分地进行思想工作。没有思想上的一致，这项工作是不能顺利进行的。在推行民族区域自治之前，在新疆有些人中间也产生了成立加盟共和国，或自治共和国的意见。这些意见是不合乎我们国家具体情况的，因此，在党内和党外进行了相当时期的讨论和研究，使大家认识了只有推行民族区域自治，才符合我国的具体情况。同时，对有些错误的意见也进行了适当的批判和纠正。此外，反革命分子进行造谣说什么“新疆要成立独立的东土耳其斯坦政府”等等。但是，这些谣言已由认识到这只有对帝国主义有利的人民，给予了坚决的打击。
    民族区域自治的实行，是我区各族人民生活中的一个具有历史性的巨大胜利，这个胜利是由于中国共产党的正确领导，是由于各族人民努力奋斗，是由于汉族劳动人民和汉族共产党员的真诚帮助而获得的。
    我们虽然胜利地实行了民族区域自治，但是要彻底实现自治权利，要加强和巩固各族人民的团结，要实现各民族事实上的平等，还需要进行许多具体工作，根据我们的经验，必须很好注意以下几点：
    （1）民族地区各级党的组织，在布置和执行全盘工作和日常工作的时候，必须充分照顾本区的特点。忽视了这一点，在工作中就会犯错误。
    （2）不断地为争取和加强各该地区各族劳动人民的团结而努力，对于妨害民族团结的各种倾向必须不断地进行斗争。在民主改革运动中，在社会主义改造中，以及在生产战线上，各族劳动人民的团结，是能够得到的。这样的团结才是建立在阶级合作基础上的真正团结——国际主义的团结，假如不建立作为民族大团结的核心的这种团结，是不可能争取和巩固民族的真正团结的。在这方面，培养少数民族的大量的工人——该民族的无产阶级，是一个最重要的问题。
    新疆维吾尔自治区已经有了民族团结的这种核心。正在涌现出的上万的各族工人，同汉族工人一起，在一个车床上，一个矿井里，即在社会主义工业化的一个战线上，互相帮助肩并肩地劳动着。他们的意志和命运是一致的，前途也是相同的。成千成万的各族劳动农民，为了进行社会主义的农业生产，他们也在生产战线上奋斗着。
    （3）要名副其实地实行民族区域自治，不要认为建立了民族区域自治的组织就等于完成了民族区域自治的全部工作。在建立民族区域自治组织后，必须充分实现自治地方的自治权利；必须主动地发现、了解和圆满解决各民族的要求；必须使少数民族亲身体会到自己当家作主，以推动他们自觉地和积极地参加本地区和整个国家的工作；必须使他们认识自己不仅是本地区的主人，而且也是国家的主人；必须使他们像热爱自己的故乡、自己民族那样来全心全意地热爱国家和全国人民。只有这样才能充分发挥少数民族人民的积极性，才能更加发扬他们爱国主义和国际主义的精神。
    （4）发展民族形式的、社会主义内容的文化，对于实现各民族事实上的平等有很大的作用。这个工作的关键在于大力发展少数民族地区的文化、教育事业，因此必须积极克服困难，为此创造条件。
    （5）应当适当划分自治区的财政权限；同时，并为了发展自治区财经工作，中央对于发展工业，尤其是地方工业，开垦荒地和发展农牧业生产，需要给予更大的物质和技术上的帮助。
    商业要用适合于少数民族地区的具体条件的办法来发展，并很好地执行价格政策，以适当地调整农牧业产品同工业产品的比价，是有重大意义的。在少数民族地区由国家举办各种建设，对于促进本区的发展有很大的作用，但是中央各部在规划和安排这些工业建设时，和在具体执行当中，应该照顾这些地区的各种困难，从交通、建筑材料和劳动力等方面同自治区取得紧密联系，以便了解情况，适当的规划是非常必要的。
    （三）在新疆维吾尔自治区培养了大批的本地民族干部
    在民族地区要顺利地进行各方面的工作，必须大量培养本地民族干部，并通过他们进行工作。新疆地区的党组织，对这一重要工作始终是重视的。七年来培养本地民族干部的工作，获得了很大的成绩。现在新疆维吾尔自治区工作的有十余万干部，其中有五万多是本地民族干部，他们一部分是前五军来的，一部分是过去就参加工作后经教育改造的，大部分是解放后新培养出来的。担任区长以上领导工作的民族干部有三千多，区委以上各级党委委员中百分之四十以上是民族干部，担任各级党委部长和书记职务的民族干部也是不少的。在工厂矿山企业中、农业部门中、学校里以及在实际工作中培养着大批的技术干部。在党的领导下，所有这些民族干部，同汉族干部在一起，并依靠他们的帮助，在各方面的工作中，发生很大的作用，这些干部大部分是经过各种民主改革，在实际工作中受到教育和锻炼的。但是，现有干部还是很不够的。培养干部方面在我们面前摆着许多重要而艰巨的工作。在今后的六、七年中，平均每年需要培养五万多干部。这是目前我们基本任务之一。
    根据我们的经验，在培养民族干部方面应该注意以下几点：
    （1）在实际工作中培养干部。加强干部之间互助合作，懂得的人应该教会不懂得的。应该大胆地培养和提拔干部；“只管提拔，不管培养”的态度是不对的。要发扬民族干部的优点，帮助他们及时地克服错误和缺点，并应给予他们以工作上的便利条件，主要的是要使民族干部在机关里用自己的语言文字进行工作；没有适当的工作条件，即便是把他们提拔起来，也很难进一步提高和发挥他们的作用。这就是说，应该充分贯彻民族干部有权有职的原则。但在同时，还应该强调有职就有责，如果某些民族干部忽视自己的责任，也就是忽视或不忠实于人民的事业；要是因此而使工作受到损失，甚至把本身的错误所造成的不好的后果，嫁祸于人或者嫁祸于汉族干部，则是极大的错误。
    （2）各民族干部必须互相学习彼此的语言文字。少数民族干部学习汉文是十分重要的。在新疆维吾尔自治区，我们认为初中以上的学校应该增设汉文课程，要求高中毕业的民族学生，必须达到或基本上达到在汉族学院里能听懂汉语讲课的水平。目前还不能对所有地方都提出这样的要求。但必须强调和逐步达到这样的要求，没有这一点，要培养少数民族高级专门人材和发展他们的文化、教育是不可能的。现在还没有大学的，甚至还没有中学的少数民族，如何能够在短时期内创办用本民族语言教学的大学呢？是否要等待这样的学校出现才培养干部呢？如果你要等待，将会连这个也没有，那个也没有。但是这决不是说，对于少数民族的语言文字可以不尊重了。我们应该很好地尊重少数民族的语言文字，并把它们作为武器来应用。小学和中学必须用各该民族的语言文字来发展。政法部门必须采用本地民族的文字。但是在科学技术上要达到先进的水平，只用本民族的语言文字是不能解决问题的。为此，只有向先进的民族学习，才能达到这个目的。
    （3）必须加强干部之间的团结，尤其是本地民族干部同汉族干部之间的团结，这是胜利进行民族地区工作的主要关键之一。维吾尔族有这样一句成语：“哥哥尊重弟弟，弟弟报答哥哥。”现在汉族干部不仅尊重了少数民族，而且克服了许多艰难困苦，忠心耿耿地为少数民族服务。假如不表扬汉族干部的这种大公无私的精神，未免有些不公。汉族干部同本地民族干部的关系，必须是兄弟之间的关系和师徒之间的关系。汉族干部必须努力教育和帮助本地民族干部，而本地民族干部则应该努力学习、努力工作，并应该向他们表示感谢。通过这些所建立和加强起来的干部之间的团结和同志式的友谊，将是牢不可破的。
    （四）多数民族应不断地派出相应的干部到少数民族地区去工作
    这是各少数民族人民的进步和发展所要求的。这不仅不会影响少数民族人民的当家作主，而且是他们管理好自己的事务所需要的。对于帮助培养少数民族干部方面来说，这也是非常必要的。如果把“机关民族化”这一句话理解成为纯粹由本民族的干部独立地管理自己的业务，那就完全错误了。这种看法，是最突出的地方民族主义的倾向。这种倾向，当然是不能允许其存在的。在新疆维吾尔自治区，已经培养了并继续培养着大批的各民族干部，也有很多汉族干部在新疆工作，今后还需要继续从内地调进汉族干部，特别是科学、技术、文教、卫生各方面的专门人材到自治区工作，在培养上述各部门的本地民族干部，特别需要不少的汉族高级知识分子。在劳动力方面，我们更需要内地不断的支援。某些部门目前已感到劳动力缺乏，在今后大规模的经济建设时期，除了充分发挥本地劳动力的效力以外，还需要成千成万的劳动力，只靠我们自己是不能完全解决这个困难的，这是大家所知道的。这就需要由内地支援大批的劳动力。我们希望中央有关部门照顾我们上述这两个要求。
    （五）不论是大民族主义或地方民族主义，从本质上来说，它是属于资产阶级思想。我们必须克服这种违背各民族人民愿望的非无产阶级的思想
    在各民族干部中间必须加强无产阶级共产主义的教育。这是一件需要经过相当长的时间、需要采取各种教育措施的艰苦工作。各民族负责的党员干部必须特别重视这个工作。在进行反对上述两种民族主义思想或是这两种民族主义倾向的斗争时，决不能为了照顾而迁就严重的错误。不过，同时也要注意避免不经过慎重研究，就把工作中一些一般问题，当作民族主义倾向而轻易地给干部扣上大民族主义或是地方民族主义的帽子的现象。对于这类现象，必须克服和防止。
    新疆维吾尔自治区在反对汉族中的大汉族主义倾向的同时，还需要反对维吾尔族对其他少数民族的大民族主义。在干部中间，必须不断地加强关于民族政策的教育。我们必须同一切危害人民利益和国家统一的资产阶级的民族主义思想同一切为帝国主义利益服务的阴谋，进行无情的斗争，必须坚决的打击和粉碎它们。
    以上就是党在新疆地区几年来工作中所取得的主要成绩和实际经验。
    我们决不忘记在我们面前还有更多的更复杂的任务，我们坚决相信这些任务一定能够实现，坚决相信新疆各族人民同全国人民一定能够胜利地共同建设成社会主义社会。
