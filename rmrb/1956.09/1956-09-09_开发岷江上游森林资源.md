    Reported by this newspaper: The review meeting on the forest management plan for the forest area in the upper reaches of the Min River in Sichuan Province, convened by the Ministry of Forestry, concluded on August 31st.
    The forest area in the upper reaches of the Min River is located within the boundaries of the four counties of Heishui, Songpan, Li County, and Maoxian, which belong to the Aba Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Sichuan Province. The entire area is extremely rich in forest resources, with an average timber stock of 410 cubic meters per hectare, and as high as 600 to 700 cubic meters in some areas. This is one to two times higher than the unit area stock in the Changbai Mountains and Greater and Lesser Khingan Mountains forest areas in our country. Land and water transportation in the upper reaches of the Min River forest area is relatively convenient. The Chengdu-Aba highway passes through this forest area and goes directly to Barkam, the location of the Aba Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture. The main stream and tributaries of the Min River can be used to transport timber with slight modifications. The upper reaches of the Min River forest area are not only one of the main bases for supplying timber to Sichuan Province but also have the function of conserving water sources and protecting crops. For thousands of years, the five million mu of fertile land in the western Sichuan Plain has relied on the water of the Min River for irrigation. However, the mountains in the upper reaches of the Min River are high and steep, and the altitude is generally above 1,600 meters. Deforestation can easily cause soil erosion. In order to actively and cautiously develop the forest resources in this forest area, the Ministry of Forestry sent a directly affiliated forest survey team in the spring of last year to investigate the forest resources in this forest area and has prepared a forest management plan for forest management and production organization.
    The recent meeting focused on discussing the forest management policy and afforestation measures in the forest area in the upper reaches of the Min River, and reviewed and approved the forest management plans for twelve management areas in this forest area. The meeting believed that the forest management policy in the forest area in the upper reaches of the Min River should be: under the principle of maintaining the forest's water conservation and soil erosion prevention functions, fully utilize mature and over-mature forests to meet the needs of national construction for timber, and at the same time adopt a policy of artificial regeneration as the main method to accelerate the restoration and regeneration of logging areas.
    The meeting also made a decision on the logging method in this forest area.
    Representatives from the Sichuan Provincial Party and government leading organs and water conservancy departments, local forestry workers, engineers, professors from forestry colleges, forestry scientific researchers, and Comrade Sergeyev, a Soviet expert from the Ministry of Forestry, also made a report at the meeting.

    开发岷江上游森林资源
    本报讯　林业部召开的四川省岷江上游林区森林经营施业案审查会议已在8月31日闭幕。
    岷江上游林区位于四川省阿坝藏族自治州所属的黑水、松潘、理县、茂县四个县的境内。全区森林资源极为丰富，每公顷平均林木蓄积量为四百一十立方公尺，较高的有六、七百立方公尺。这比我国长白山和大小兴安岭林区的单位面积蓄量高一两倍。岷江上游林区的水陆运输都较方便，成阿公路穿过这个林区，直达阿坝藏族自治州所在地的刷经寺。岷江的主流和支流稍加修整，即能流送木材。岷江上游林区不仅是四川省供应木材的主要基地之一，而且具有涵养水源和保护农作物的作用。川西平原的五百万亩良田几千年来一直靠岷江的水灌溉。但是，岷江上游地区山高坡陡，海拔高度一般都在一千六百公尺以上。森林被伐后极易引起水土冲刷。林业部为了积极慎重地开发这个林区的森林资源，在去年春季曾派一个直属的森林调查队，调查了这个林区的森林资源，并已编制了森林经营和组织生产的森林施业案。
    最近这次会议着重地讨论了岷江上游林区的森林经营方针和营林措施，并审查通过这一林区十二个施业区的森林施业案。会议认为岷江上游林区的森林经营方针应当是：在保持森林的涵养水源、防止水土冲刷等防护作用的原则下，充分利用已经成熟和过熟的森林，以满足国家建设对木材的需要，同时采取以人工更新为主的方针，加速采伐迹地的恢复更新。
    会议对于这个林区的采伐方式问题，也作出了决定。
    参加这次会议的有四川省党政领导机关和水利部门的代表，地方林业工作者、工程师以及林业学院的教授、林业科学研究工作者，林业部苏联专家谢尔盖也夫同志也在会上作了报告。
