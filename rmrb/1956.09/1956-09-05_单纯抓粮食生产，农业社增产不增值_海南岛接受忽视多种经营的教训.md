Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, September 4th (Xinhua reporter Feng Ziping): At the Hainan District County Party Committee Secretary Conference held at the end of August, a painful lesson was drawn when summarizing agricultural production in the first half of this year. That lesson is: ignoring the characteristics of the local rural economy and focusing solely on leading grain production will inevitably lead to serious adverse consequences.

This year, Hainan Island had an unprecedented bumper harvest of summer grain crops, with total output increasing by 62% compared to 1954, the year with the highest grain output in history. However, the results of the summer harvest pre-distribution showed that 80% of the agricultural cooperatives across the island did not meet the requirement of increasing income for more than 90% of their members. According to a survey of 1,401 cooperatives in nine counties, among 186,996 cooperative member households, only 54.9% saw an increase in income, 16.6% maintained the same income as last year, and 28.5% experienced a decrease in income. Due to reduced income, eight agricultural cooperatives have already collapsed, and 12,936 cooperative member households have withdrawn from the cooperatives. Currently, more than 5,000 households are wavering and seeking to withdraw.

The meeting concluded that the main reason for the increase in output but not in value was the sole focus on grain production. Since the basic realization of semi-socialist agricultural cooperation on Hainan Island last winter, Party and government leading organs at all levels have devoted all their efforts to leading agricultural cooperatives in grain production, while relaxing their leadership over cash crops and sideline production. As a result, while the achievements in increasing rice production in various places have been very prominent, most sideline production and cash crop production have sharply declined. In the first half of this year, the production of local specialties in various parts of Hainan Island decreased by half compared to the same period last year, and poultry production decreased by 91.4%. Due to poor sideline and cash crop production, the labor remuneration of agricultural cooperatives is very low. According to a survey of 3,159 cooperatives in thirteen counties, only 0.83% of the cooperatives distributed more than one yuan per labor day in the summer pre-distribution, 20.2% distributed between five jiao and one yuan, and 78.97% distributed less than five jiao.

The meeting believed that although the reason for focusing solely on grain production was related to the excessive demands from higher-level leading organs for Hainan Island to achieve grain self-sufficiency as quickly as possible, the most important reason was that the local Party and government leaders did not have a thorough understanding of the characteristics of the local rural economy. According to the survey, grain production has historically only accounted for about half of Hainan Island's rural economy. Planting various cash crops and engaging in sideline occupations are important sources of income for farmers. Hainan Island is a good place for China to develop tropical and subtropical cash crops. The state and the people urgently require the local area to develop these valuable raw materials and non-staple foods faster, more abundantly, and better, in order to support the country's socialist industrialization and meet the people's living needs. However, in this important area, the local Party and government departments have not given the due attention in the past.

Another reason for the formation of a single operation is the failure to accept the opinions of the masses and promptly correct shortcomings in the work. When various places began to concentrate all their efforts on rice production, experienced farmers—especially farmers in areas that have historically suffered from severe natural disasters such as drought and typhoons, and where grain production is not stable enough—raised objections, believing that this would not work. However, in order to complete the grain production "tasks," many cadres turned a blind eye to the demands and voices of the masses, and even labeled those who disagreed with focusing solely on rice production as "conservative," "backward," and "spontaneous capitalist forces," conducting criticism and "educational persuasion" against them. As a result, agricultural cooperatives had no choice but to abandon diversified operations and reluctantly engage in grain production. As a result, income decreased, and this year, due to blindly expanding the rice planting area, 100,000 mu of paddy fields were damaged.

In order to learn from this painful lesson and make up for the losses caused by solely engaging in grain production, the Hainan District County Party Committee Secretary Conference has decided to take giving equal importance to increasing grain production and developing cash crops as the guiding principle for current agricultural production on Hainan Island, and to vigorously develop diversified economies such as animal husbandry, fishery, and forestry, in accordance with local conditions. While striving for a bumper autumn grain harvest, mobilize the masses to launch a movement to develop sideline and cash crop production, striving to make sideline and cash crop income reach 50% of the total income, so that more than 90% of the members of the vast majority of agricultural cooperatives will increase their income.

### 单纯抓粮食生产，农业社增产不增值  海南岛接受忽视多种经营的教训

    单纯抓粮食生产，农业社增产不增值
    海南岛接受忽视多种经营的教训
  新华社广州4日电　新华社记者冯子平报道：在8月底举行的中共海南区县委书记会议，总结今年上半年农业生产时，得出了一个沉痛教训，这个教训就是：忽视当地农村经济特点，单纯领导粮食生产，一定带来严重的恶果。
    今年海南岛夏季粮食作物空前丰收，总产量比历史上粮食产量最高的1954年增产六成二。但是夏收预分的结果表明，全岛80％的农业社没有达到90％以上的社员增加收入的要求。据九个县一千四百零一个社调查，在一十八万六千九百九十六户社员中，增加收入的农户只占54.9％，保持去年收入的农户占16.6％，减少收入农户占28.5％。因为收入减少，已经有八个农业社垮台，一万二千九百三十六户社员退社，目前动摇和闹退社的还有五千多户。
    会议认为，增产不增值的主要原因，是单纯抓粮食生产的结果。自从去年冬天海南岛基本实现半社会主义的农业合作化以后，各级党政领导机关都全力领导农业社搞粮食生产，放松了对经济作物和副业生产的领导。因此，各地稻谷增产的成绩虽然非常突出，但是绝大部分副业生产和经济作物生产却骤然下降。今年上半年，海南岛各地的土特产生产比去年同期减少了一半，家禽生产下降了91.4％。由于副业和经济作物生产不好，农业社的劳动报酬很低。据十三个县三千一百五十九个社调查，夏季预分每个劳动日分配一元以上的社只占0.83％，分得五角到一元的社占20.2％，五角以下的社占78.97％。
    会议认为单抓粮食生产的原因虽然和上级领导机关过急地要求海南岛实现粮食自给有关，但最重要的还是因为当地党政领导对当地农村的特点了解得不够不透。据调查：海南岛的粮食生产历来只占海南岛农村经济的一半左右，种植各种经济作物和经营副业，是农民收入的重要来源。海南岛是我国发展热带和亚热带经济作物的好地方，国家和人民都迫切要求当地更快、更多、更好地发展这些珍贵的原料和副食品，以支援国家社会主义工业化和满足人民的生活需要。但是在这个重要方面过去一直没有引起当地党政部门应有的重视。
    形成单一经营的另一原因是没有接受群众的意见，及时纠正工作上的缺点。当各地开始集中全力搞稻谷生产时，有经验的农民——特别是历来干旱、台风等自然灾害严重，粮食生产不够稳定的地区的农民，就提出异议，认为这样行不通。但是许多干部为了完成粮食生产“任务”，对群众的要求和呼声置之不理，并且还给不同意单搞稻谷生产的人扣上“保守”、“落后”、
  “资本主义自发势力”的帽子，进行批判和“教育说服”，这样，农业社只好不搞多种经营，硬着头皮去搞粮食生产，结果，收入减少了，今年还由于盲目扩大稻谷面积，有十万亩稻田受到损失。
    为了接受这个沉痛的教训，弥补单纯从事粮食生产所造成的损失，中共海南区县委书记会议已经决定，以增加粮食生产和发展经济作物并重作为指导当前海南岛农业生产的方针，并且因地制宜，大力发展畜牧业、渔业、林业等多种经济。在争取秋季粮食丰收的同时，发动群众开展副业和经济作物生产运动，争取副业和经济作物收入达到总收入50％，使绝大部分农业社90％以上的社员增加收入。
