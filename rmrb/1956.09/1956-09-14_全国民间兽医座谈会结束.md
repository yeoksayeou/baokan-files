Xinhua News Agency report:

    The National Symposium of Folk Veterinarians, which concluded on the 11th, thoroughly researched and discussed 540 tested remedies for treating swine fever, equine glanders, tetanus, and liver fluke disease in cattle and sheep. The symposium also studied the use of acupuncture to treat livestock diseases.
    The symposium considered that further developing the role of folk veterinarians is of extremely significant importance for carrying out veterinary epidemic prevention work and developing China's animal husbandry. According to recent reports from various provinces, there are currently about 150,000 folk veterinarians nationwide, averaging about 70 per county, a figure that accounts for more than 90% of the country’s veterinary personnel. Currently, some folk veterinarians have joined agricultural (livestock) production cooperatives, and some have organized joint veterinary clinics in towns and villages. They have made great contributions to preventing and controlling livestock epidemics and assisting farmers in doing a good job in livestock hygiene, feeding management, and health care. However, some agricultural production cooperatives, due to insufficient understanding of the importance of epidemic prevention and livestock development, do not pay enough attention to veterinary work, and the remuneration for folk veterinarians is not entirely reasonable, generally with low scores, thus affecting the work enthusiasm of folk veterinarians. After studying these issues, the symposium put forward opinions on the remuneration of full-time and part-time folk veterinarians, based on the principle of "to each according to his work."
    The symposium also pointed out that organizing joint clinics and signing "look after the trough and protect the livestock" contracts with agricultural production cooperatives is a very effective way to improve livestock feeding management, reduce the occurrence of epidemics, and protect livestock health. However, this work has been interrupted in some areas. Because this measure has great significance in livestock protection and epidemic prevention work, the meeting requested that all localities continue to implement and promote it under the principle of mutual voluntariness, based on different circumstances. Livestock and veterinary associations, which have a good effect on uniting folk veterinarians, should also be established in the next one or two years.
    Regarding improving the skills of folk veterinarians and accepting the legacy of traditional Chinese veterinary medicine, the symposium considered this to be a crucial task for realizing the goal stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) of basically eliminating animal diseases such as rinderpest, swine fever, sheep scabies, and equine glanders within seven or twelve years. Therefore, the meeting requested that all localities strengthen mutual assistance, mutual learning, and unity and cooperation between Chinese and Western veterinarians, extensively collect and collate folk remedies and proven prescriptions scattered among the people, and help experienced folk veterinarians organize and publish their medical experience and clinical techniques.
    Before the symposium concluded, Vice Premier of the State Council Deng Zihui met with all the attendees.

### 全国民间兽医座谈会结束

    全国民间兽医座谈会结束
    据新华社讯  治疗猪瘟、马鼻疽、破伤风和牛、羊肝蛭等疫病的五百四十个验方，在11日结束的全国民间兽医座谈会上曾进行了充分的研究和讨论。同时，座谈会还研究了用针灸治疗家畜疾病问题。
    座谈会认为进一步发挥民间兽医的作用，对开展兽疫防治工作和发展我国畜牧业是有极其重大意义的。根据最近各省的报告，目前全国民间兽医约有十五万人，平均每个县约有七十人，这个数字占全国兽医人员的90％以上，现在，各地的民间兽医一部分参加了农（牧）业生产合作社，一部分在城镇和农村组织了兽医联合诊疗所。他们在防治家畜疫病和协同农民做好家畜卫生和饲养管理、保健工作等方面，已经作出了很大贡献。但是，有些农业生产合作社因对防治疫病、发展畜牧业的重要性认识不足，不重视兽医工作，给民间兽医的报酬不尽合理，一般都存在着评分偏低的现象，因此影响了民间兽医的工作积极性。座谈会根据这些问题进行研究以后，就按劳取酬的原则对专职的和半农半医的民间兽医的报酬问题，提出了意见。
    座谈会还指出，组织联合诊疗所与农业生产合作社订立“看槽保畜”合同，是改善牲畜饲养管理、减少疫病发生、保护牲畜健康的一项很有成效的工作。但是现在这个工作有些地区中断了。由于这一措施在保畜防疫工作上有巨大意义，因此，会议要求各地根据不同情况在双方自愿的原则下继续实行和推广。各地对团结民间兽医有良好作用的畜牧兽医协会，也应该在一两年内建立起来。
    关于提高民间兽医技术和接受祖国兽医遗产的问题，座谈会认为这也是实现全国农业发展纲要（草案）中规定在七年或十二年内基本上消灭牛瘟、猪瘟、羊疥癣和马鼻疽等兽疫的一项极重要的工作。因此会议要求各地必须加强中、西兽医之间的互助、互学和团结合作，广泛搜集、整理散失在民间的成药和验方，并帮助有经验的民间兽医将医疗经验和临床技术整理出版。
    座谈会结束以前，国务院副总理邓子恢曾接见了出席会议的全体人员。
