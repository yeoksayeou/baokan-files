Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, August 31st: Chinese Ambassador to Mongolia He Ying held a banquet on the 30th to celebrate the signing of the Sino-Mongolian Economic and Technical Assistance Agreement.

Among those present at the banquet were: Mongolian Council of Ministers Chairman Yumjaagiin Tsedenbal, First Deputy Chairman Sonomyn Luvsandorj, Deputy Chairman Damdinjavyn Maydar, Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party Central Committee Political Bureau members Balaji Nima, Secretary Dugersuren, and heads of various government departments.

Also present at the banquet were Lu Xuzhang, head of the Chinese Economic Delegation, and all members of the delegation. The Soviet, North Korean, and Czechoslovakian ambassadors to Mongolia were also invited to attend the banquet.

He Ying warmly congratulated the signing of the Sino-Mongolian Economic and Technical Assistance Agreement at the banquet. He said that the Chinese people harbor a strong desire to further develop mutual assistance and cooperation with our close neighbor—the fraternal Mongolian People’s Republic—and to seek common economic and cultural advancement for both countries. Although the assistance China is currently providing is meager and far from meeting Mongolia's actual needs, our desire is strong. We believe that as both countries continue to achieve new and greater successes in economic and cultural construction, this close, selfless relationship of mutual assistance and cooperation between China and Mongolia will continue to grow.

Tsedenbal also spoke at the meeting. He first expressed his heartfelt thanks to China for its selfless assistance to the Mongolian People's Republic. He said that only in this new era opened up by the great October Socialist Revolution, is it possible for the peoples of all countries liberated from imperialist oppression to establish such a fraternal friendship relationship as ours.

The banquet proceeded in a warm and friendly atmosphere.

    我驻蒙古大使何英举行宴会
    据新华社31日讯　乌兰巴托消息：中国驻蒙古大使何英30日举行宴会，祝贺中蒙经济和技术援助协定的签订。
    出席宴会的有：蒙古部长会议主席泽登巴尔、第一副主席锡林迪布、副主席曾德，蒙古人民革命党中央委员会政治局委员巴拉吉尼玛、书记杜格苏伦以及政府各部的负责人。
    出席宴会的还有中国经济代表团团长卢绪章和代表团全体人员。苏联、朝鲜、捷克斯洛伐克驻蒙古使节也应邀出席了宴会。
    何英在宴会上热烈祝贺中蒙经济技术援助协定的签订。他说，中国人民怀着和亲密邻邦——兄弟的蒙古人民共和国进一步发展互助合作关系和求得两国经济及文化共同高涨的强烈愿望。虽然目前中国给予的援助是微薄的，还远不能满足蒙古的实际需要，但我们的愿望是强烈的。我们相信在两国经济及文化建设不断取得新的更大的成就的情况下，中蒙两国之间的这种亲密无私的互助合作关系将会得到愈来愈大的发展。
    泽登巴尔也在会上讲了话。他首先对中国给予蒙古人民共和国的无私的援助表示衷心的感谢。他说，只有伟大的十月社会主义革命开辟的这个新时代，从帝国主义压迫下解放出来的各国人民才有可能建立我们这种兄弟般的友谊关系。
    宴会一直在热烈友好的气氛中进行。
