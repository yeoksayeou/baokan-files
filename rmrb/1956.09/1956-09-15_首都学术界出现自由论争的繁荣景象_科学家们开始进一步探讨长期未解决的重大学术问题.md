Xinhua News Agency, 14th: Since the proposal of the "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom" policy, academic research in the capital has become increasingly active, and the atmosphere of free debate has become even stronger. This is a sign that a flourishing scene will emerge in China's academic circles.

Scientists have begun further explorations of some major academic issues that have remained unresolved for a long time. In historical science, debates have revolved around issues such as the periodization of ancient societies, the emergence of Chinese capitalism, the formation of the Han nationality, and the periodization of modern history. Historian Rong Mengyuan recently published an article expressing his new views on the periodization of modern Chinese history. Many experts in modern history are writing papers on the periodization issue, preparing to participate in a national-scale discussion meeting on the periodization of modern history scheduled for next year.

A large-scale collection and compilation of historical materials is underway. In the field of archaeology, more than ten types of ancient inscription albums and field excavation and investigation materials have been systematically compiled. The "Index of Chinese Historical Studies Papers" currently being compiled gathers a catalog of specialized discussions on various historical issues since the founding of Chinese magazines. Paper collections on various controversial issues in historical studies will also be published. Historians and ethnologists recently began large-scale ethnological survey work. These expanded collections and studies of historical materials will provide favorable conditions for further discussion of the periodization of ancient history.

The Institute of Economics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences is compiling modern Chinese economic data, which will help scholars in this field explore the germination period of Chinese capitalism by deeply studying the specific economic conditions developing within feudal society.

In natural sciences, many specialized academic journals have recently debated geology, geography, genetics, and cytology. In geological circles, the new school of geological mechanics formed by Li Siguang in the study of geomechanics also has different views among geologists. Zhang Wenyou and other geologists are developing a discussion on this issue from the practical analysis of compiling the Tectonic Map of China.

The enormous achievements of China's economic construction practices are increasingly raising many new questions for social scientists. For example, the theoretical issues of China's transition period and socialist mode of production, as well as the comprehensive major issues in national economic construction, urgently need to be systematically studied. Many economists in the capital have been collecting relevant materials during the summer vacation and will begin to explore and study these issues.

Philosophers have launched further research on bourgeois idealist philosophy. Professor He Lin, a well-known expert in Hegel's philosophy, is conducting a systematic discussion on Hegel's philosophy. The research of Professor He Lin and others is a highly valuable academic work. Other philosophers such as Jin Yuelin and Zheng Xin will respectively conduct systematic research on Russell's philosophy and Kant's philosophy.

Doctrines of different ideological systems have also begun to be freely taught in universities in the capital. Two comprehensive universities in Beijing—Peking University and Renmin University of China—have launched two new courses, "Russell's Philosophy" and "Kant's Philosophy," starting in the new academic year. Starting next year, new courses such as "Aristotle's Philosophy," "Hegel's Philosophy," as well as philosophical aspects related to positivism and neo-positivism, will be successively offered. These courses include everything from ancient Greek philosophy, various modern idealist philosophies, to some of the most popular idealist philosophical schools in modern bourgeois philosophy. In higher political and legal colleges in the capital, courses on bourgeois state law and Roman law will also be offered. The systematic introduction and teaching of these bourgeois doctrines in universities in the capital is significant not only in cultivating students' ability to think independently but also in enabling researchers to further consolidate the materialist ideological position through free academic debates and comparisons.

Experts are compiling China's first textbook on the history of philosophy. Guo Moruo, Pan Zinian, Hu Sheng, Feng Youlan, and others have participated in discussions on the compilation of Chinese philosophical history.

    首都学术界出现自由论争的繁荣景象
    科学家们开始进一步探讨长期未解决的重大学术问题
    新华社14日讯从“百家争鸣”的方针提出后，首都学术界的研究工作日见活跃，自由论争的空气更加浓厚起来。这是我国学术界将出现一个繁荣景象的征兆。
    科学家们对一些长期以来没有解决的重大学术问题，已开始作进一步的探讨。在历史科学中曾经争论的有古代社会的分期、中国资本主义的萌芽、汉民族的形成，以及近代史的分期等许多问题。史学家荣孟源在最近发表了他对中国近代史分期问题的新的看法的文章。不少近代史专家们，正在撰写分期问题的论文，准备参加预定在明年举行的一个全国规模的近代史分期问题的讨论会。
    一个大规模的史料搜集和整理工作正在进行。考古学方面已系统地整理了十多种古代铭文专辑和田野发掘考察资料。正在编制的“中国史学论文索引”，汇集了我国杂志创始以来的各种史学问题专论目录。史学上的各种争论问题的论文专辑也将要出版。史学家和民族学家们在不久前开始了大规模的民族学调查工作。这些对史料的扩大搜集和研究，将为古代史分期问题的进一步讨论提供有利条件。
    中国科学院经济研究所进行的中国近代经济资料的整理，将帮助这方面的学者们从深入钻研在封建社会内部发展着的具体经济情况，来探讨中国资本主义的萌芽期。
    在自然科学中，许多专门学术刊物上最近对地质、地理、遗传学和细胞学都有争论。在地质学界，由李四光在研究大地构造问题中所形成的地质力学的新学派，他的见解在地质学家中也有不同的看法。张文佑和其他地质学家们，正从编制中国大地构造图的实际分析中展开对这一问题的讨论。
    我国经济建设实践所取得的巨大成效，日益为社会科学家提出了很多新的问题。例如我国过渡时期和社会主义生产方式的理论问题，以及国民经济建设中的综合性的重大问题，急待系统地加以研究。首都不少的经济学家们，已在暑期中收集有关资料，将展开对这些问题的探讨和研究。
    哲学家们对资产阶级唯心主义哲学展开了进一步的研究。我国著名的黑格尔哲学专家贺麟教授等正对黑格尔哲学进行系统的论述。贺麟教授等人的这一研究，是一项极有价值的学术工作。其它哲学家如金岳霖、郑昕等都将分别对罗素哲学和康德哲学作系统的研究。
    不同思想体系的学说在首都高等学校中也开始进行自由讲授。北京的两所综合大学——北京大学和中国人民大学已从新学年起开设“罗素哲学”、“康德哲学”两门新课程。明年起还要陆续开出“亚理斯多德哲学”、“黑格尔哲学”，以及有关实证论和新实证论等哲学方面的新课程。这些课程，包括着从古希腊哲学、近代各种唯心主义哲学，直到现代在资产阶级哲学中最流行的一些唯心主义哲学派别。在首都的高等政法院校中，也将开设资产阶级国家法和罗马法的课程。这些资产阶级学说在首都高等学校中作系统的介绍和讲授，其意义不仅在于培养学生的独立思考能力，同时也使研究者通过学术上的自由争辩、比较，最终使唯物主义思想阵地更加巩固。
    专家们正在编写我国第一部哲学史教科书。郭沫若、潘梓年、胡绳、冯友兰等人，都曾参加关于中国哲学史整理的讨论。
