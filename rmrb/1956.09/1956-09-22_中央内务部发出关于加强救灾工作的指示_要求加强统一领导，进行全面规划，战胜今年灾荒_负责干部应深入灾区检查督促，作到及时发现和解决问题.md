Xinhua News Agency, September 21st: The Ministry of Internal Affairs issued instructions on September 21st regarding "Strengthening Disaster Relief Work." The instructions stated that although this year's natural disasters are roughly equivalent to those of 1954, it is estimated that the nation's total grain output will still exceed that of the bumper year of 1955. The state has successively allocated a huge amount of relief funds totaling 220.5 million yuan and agricultural loans of 150 million yuan. In particular, the cooperativization of agriculture provides more favorable conditions for overcoming natural disasters this year. The instructions stated that to overcome the famine, it is first necessary to strengthen unified leadership and carry out comprehensive planning. Disaster areas should have responsible cadres personally take charge of production and disaster relief work, strengthen the organizational leadership of the Production and Disaster Relief Committee, and instruct relevant departments to formulate practical and feasible business plans based on changes in the post-disaster situation, focusing on the common task of production and disaster relief, and cooperate with each other. Disaster relief work should give full play to the advantages of agricultural production cooperatives, with the agricultural production cooperatives uniformly planning production and disaster relief work within their respective communities. At the same time, it is necessary to strengthen the leadership of agricultural production cooperatives, rather than letting them drift unchecked without inspection or supervision. Individual farmers should also be organized into the production self-salvation movement.

The instructions stated that higher-level governments should regularly send work teams to lower levels to investigate disasters or conduct specialized investigations and research. In particular, responsible cadres should personally go deep into disaster areas to inspect and supervise, so as to discover problems and solve them in a timely manner. It is wrong to only make arrangements without inspection and supervision, or to only listen to reports without in-depth investigation. At the same time, lower-level governments should also report changes in the disaster situation and the progress of various production and disaster relief efforts to the higher levels at any time, so that the higher levels can understand and guide in a timely manner.

At the same time, ideological education for disaster victims should be strengthened. Production and disaster relief is a mass undertaking, and only by giving play to the strength of the masses themselves can any difficulties be overcome. Currently, the production self-salvation movement is underway in disaster areas, but some serious problems still exist in the thinking of some cadres and the masses: some people are pessimistic and despairing, lacking confidence in production self-salvation; some people simply rely on state relief and loans, or simply rely on the supply of agricultural production cooperatives; some people are unwilling to stay in their hometowns to engage in production self-salvation and restore their homes, and blindly flee to other places to escape the famine. These ideas hinder the development of the production and disaster relief movement. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen ideological education for disaster victims, encourage their enthusiasm for production self-salvation, and quickly organize them into agricultural production, sideline production, and various engineering construction projects.

Agricultural production is the main task of shortening the disaster period. In terms of agricultural production in disaster areas, we should correct the tendency in some places to look down on the remaining autumn harvest, to be unwilling to put in the effort to harvest carefully, to not strive to harvest damaged or substandard grain, and to not actively collect substitutes for food.

Regarding sideline production in disaster areas, the current problem is that although there are plans, they have not yet been widely implemented. Some areas have no plans, and some plans are based on imagination or old experience, which are not in line with the actual situation. To develop sideline production, planning is very important. If a disaster area identifies several major sideline industries, with guaranteed funds, raw materials, and sales channels, signs contracts, and carries out planned production, it can boost morale and rapidly develop. The most important thing here is not to commit subjectivism, and not to completely abandon the old foundations and old habits. The original combination of agriculture and sideline industries in rural areas was very close, and the suspension of one item will affect other items. However, in some places, old habits are no longer feasible due to reduced raw material production, and new avenues must be found, or raw materials must be transferred from other places to maintain the old foundations. Some sideline industries are no longer needed by the state and the masses, and should also be changed according to the situation. All of these should be planned properly in advance. Emphasizing major sideline industries does not mean that minor sideline industries should be ignored. Minor sideline industries should be adapted to local conditions and be diverse. Currently, there are also problems with purchasing prices and tax rates not taking into account the difficulties of disaster victims, which also affects their enthusiasm for engaging in sideline production and must be resolved. We must prevent the phenomenon of undergrading or undervaluing disaster victims' products or failing to reduce or exempt taxes. On the other hand, we should also educate disaster victims to learn technology, improve production efficiency, and ensure product specifications and quality to prevent shoddy products.

Organizing disaster victims to engage in various engineering construction projects using the method of work relief is a combination of disaster relief and disaster prevention, which can not only enable disaster victims to immediately obtain income, but also quickly restore and improve water conservancy, transportation and other projects. In particular, water conservancy projects can avoid future disasters. Carrying out work relief can accommodate a large amount of labor in disaster areas, allowing them to maintain their livelihoods through their own labor, without having to rely entirely on relief, and can prevent disaster victims from blindly fleeing. This is a win-win situation, and all localities should focus on it. In carrying out work relief, we should both ensure the needs of the project and take care of the difficulties of the disaster victims, and should not only pay attention to one aspect.

The instructions stated that relief funds should be used for disaster victims' food relief and subsidies for housing, winter clothing, medical care, and livestock feed, focusing on ensuring the lives of disaster victims. The difficulties of agricultural production cooperatives in production should mainly be solved with loans. The distribution of relief funds should adhere to the principle of combining leadership control with mass evaluation, especially with open and reasonable evaluation. Township governments should guide agricultural production cooperatives to do a good job in evaluation. All that should be issued to individuals should be issued to individuals. Food relief should be distributed in several concentrated installments, rather than being too piecemeal, so that disaster victims can make their own plans. Priority should be given to the families of revolutionary martyrs, military families, disabled veterans, and demobilized soldiers who have difficulties in their lives. Agricultural production cooperatives should be responsible for arranging and taking care of the "Five Guarantees" households in disaster areas. If the strength of the community is not enough, then relief should be provided. Disaster victims who have not joined the cooperative should be given the same relief. Governments above the county level should have designated personnel to manage relief funds, strictly preventing corruption, misappropriation, waste, and backlog. In addition, we should do a good job in reducing or exempting agricultural taxes in disaster areas to reduce the burden on disaster victims, which is actually a very large relief.

We should do a good job in supplying materials, actively transferring food, coal, oil, salt, cloth, cotton, building materials, medicines, seeds, fertilizers and other living and production materials needed by disaster victims, ensuring that disaster victims can purchase physical goods after relief funds and loans are issued. In particular, we should accurately grasp the population lacking food and the time of food shortage, prepare early, and ensure supply. When transferring materials, organizing disaster victims to participate in transportation work can not only enable the materials to be quickly transported to the disaster area, but also enable the disaster victims to obtain income, which is also a win-win situation, and all localities should adopt it appropriately.

We should quickly help disaster victims repair their houses so that they have a place to live. The labor required to repair houses should be uniformly allocated by agricultural production cooperatives. The required building materials should be used as much as possible with old materials, or quickly transferred from other places to ensure the needs of disaster victims. The funds needed for construction should be solved by self-raising, loans, and relief. For some houses that cannot be repaired temporarily, relatives or neighbors should be mobilized to vacate empty rooms for temporary resettlement. Housing construction should be timely and ensure a certain quality, able to shelter from wind, rain, and cold, so that disaster victims can safely spend the winter.

We should pay attention to health work in disaster areas, implement the policy of prevention being more important than treatment, and organize disaster victims to improve environmental sanitation and prevent the spread of epidemics. At the same time, we should organize Chinese and Western medical personnel to carry out fixed or mobile medical work in disaster areas.

We should protect livestock and solve the difficulty of insufficient forage and feed. Mobilize the masses to cut grass and store green feed, and save forage. Livestock that cannot be preserved in disaster areas should be moved to non-disaster areas to engage in transportation and production, to raise livestock with livestock, and to raise people with livestock; or mobilize agricultural production cooperatives in non-disaster areas to feed them on their behalf, sign mutual aid contracts, so that agricultural production cooperatives in non-disaster areas can benefit from the use of livestock, and agricultural production cooperatives in disaster areas can also get appropriate remuneration. At the same time, we must repair stables so that livestock have a place to spend the winter.

We should prevent disaster victims from blindly flowing out. Step up production self-salvation and do a good job in relief work, so that disaster victims can see that there is hope for the restoration of their hometowns and are happy to participate in the production self-salvation movement in their hometowns. Those who continue to flow out should be dissuaded, explaining that blind famine relief is detrimental to social order and to the disaster victims themselves. For disaster areas that cannot accommodate many laborers for a while, higher-level governments should take the initiative to organize labor transfer, so that they can participate in temporary labor production in other places. For disaster victims who cannot restore production in their hometowns, we should find ways to resettle them elsewhere.

    中央内务部发出关于加强救灾工作的指示
    要求加强统一领导，进行全面规划，战胜今年灾荒
    负责干部应深入灾区检查督促，作到及时发现和解决问题
    新华社21日讯　内务部于21日发出了关于“加强救灾工作的指示”。指示说，今年虽然遇到和1954年大体相等的自然灾害，但估计全国粮食的总产量仍将超过丰收的1955年，国家先后已拨出二亿二千零五十万元的巨额救济款和一亿五千万元的农贷，特别是农业的合作化，使今年战胜自然灾害更具备了有利条件。指示说，要战胜灾荒，首先必须加强统一领导和进行全面规划。灾区应当有负责干部亲自掌握生产救灾工作，加强生产救灾委员会的组织领导，责成各有关部门根据灾后情况的变化，围绕着生产救灾这一共同的任务，制定出切实可行的业务计划，互相配合。救灾工作应充分发挥农业生产合作社的优越性，由农业生产合作社统一规划本社生产救灾工作。同时，要加强对农业生产合作社的领导，而不能放任自流，不加检查督促。对于个体农户也应当组织在生产自救运动之中。
    指示说，上级政府应当经常派工作组到下面去查灾，或作专门的调查研究，特别是负责干部应当亲自深入灾区检查督促，以便及时发现问题，解决问题。只作布置，不加检查督促，只听报告，不深入考察，是不对的。同时下级政府也应当随时向上面反映灾情变化和各项生产救灾工作进行的情况，使上面能及时了解，及时指导。
    同时，应当加强对灾民的思想教育。生产救灾是群众性的工作，只有发挥群众自己的力量才能战胜任何困难。目前灾区的生产自救运动正在开展，但部分干部和群众思想上还存在着一些严重问题：有些人悲观失望，对生产自救信心不足；有些人单纯依赖国家救济和贷款，或者单纯依靠农业生产合作社供给；有些人不愿留在家乡生产自救，恢复家园，而盲目出外逃荒。这些思想，都妨碍生产救灾运动的开展。因此，必须加强对灾民的思想教育，鼓励他们生产自救的积极性，迅速把他们组织到农业生产、副业生产和各项工程建设中去。
    农业生产是缩短灾期的主要工作，在灾区农业生产方面，应该纠正有些地方看不起残秋，不愿费工细打细收，不去争取收获坏粮次粮，不积极采集代食品等偏向。
    关于灾区副业生产，当前存在的问题是虽有规划，但尚未普遍进入行动，有的还没有规划，有的规划是凭空想像或凭老经验制定的，不合实际情况。开展副业生产，规划很重要，一个灾区确定了几项大宗副业，资金、原料、销路有保证，订立合同，进行计划生产，即可以振奋人心，迅速开展。这里最重要的是不要犯主观主义，不要把老基础老习惯一脚踢开，农村农、副业原来结合很密切，其中有一项停顿就要影响其他项目。可是有些地方因原料减产，老习惯也就行不通了，又必须另找新的门路，或者从外地调进原料来维持老基础。某些副业门路已不为国家和群众所需要，则也要根据情况加以改变。这些都要事先规划得当。重视大宗副业并不是说要忽视小宗副业，小宗副业更应当因地制宜，多式多样。当前还存在着收购价格和税率没有照顾灾民困难的问题，也影响灾民从事副业生产的积极性，必须设法解决。要防止对灾民产品压级压价或不减免税收的现象，另一方面也应当教育灾民学习技术，提高生产效率，保证产品规格质量，以防粗制滥造。
    用以工代赈的办法组织灾民从事各项工程建设，是救灾和防灾相结合的办法，既能使灾民马上得到收入，又能迅速恢复并改进水利、交通等工程。特别是水利工程，能够避免今后的灾害。开展以工代赈，就能够容纳灾区的大量劳动力，使他们可以靠自己劳动维持生活，而不必完全依赖救济，并且可以防止灾民盲目外逃。这是一举几得的事，各地应当着重进行。开展以工代赈，应当既保证工程的需要，又照顾灾民的困难，不可只注意一个方面。
    指示说，救济款要用于灾民口粮的救济和房屋、寒衣、医疗、牲畜饲料补助等方面，着重保证灾民的生活。农业生产合作社在生产上的困难，主要应当用贷款来解决。救济款的发放应当坚持领导掌握与群众评议相结合的原则，特别是要有公开的合理的评议，乡政府应当指导农业生产合作社做好评议工作。凡应当发给个人的，都应当发给个人。口粮救济要分几次集中发放，不要过于零星，以便灾民可以自己作计划。对于生活有困难的烈属、军属、残废军人、复员军人应当优先照顾。对于灾区“五保”对象，农业生产合作社应当负责加以安排和照顾，如果本社力量不够，则应当救济。对于未入社的灾民应当给予同样的救济。县以上政府应当有专人管理救济款，严格防止贪污、挪用、浪费、积压等现象。此外，应当做好灾区农业税的减免工作，减轻灾民的负担，这实际上也是一项很大的救济。
    应当做好物资供应工作，积极调运灾民所需要的粮、煤、油、盐、布匹、棉花、建筑材料、药品、种子、肥料等生活和生产资料，保证救济款、贷款发放后，灾民能购得实物。特别应当切实掌握缺粮人口和缺粮时间，及早准备，保证供应。在调运物资时，组织灾民参加运输工作，既能使物资迅速运到灾区，又能使灾民得到收入，也是一举两得的事，各地应当适当采用。
    应当迅速帮助灾民修复房屋，使他们有安身之所。修复房屋所需劳动力，应当由农业生产合作社统一调配。所需房料，应当尽量利用旧料，或者迅速从外地调运，以保证灾民的需要。建筑所需资金，应当用自筹、贷款、救济三个办法来解决。有些房屋暂时确无法修复的，应当动员亲友或邻居腾出空房临时安置。房屋修建要及时，并要保证一定的质量，能够避风、避雨、抗寒，使灾民安全过冬。
    应当重视灾区卫生工作，贯彻防重于治的方针，组织灾民改善环境卫生，防止疫病流行。同时要组织中西医务人员到灾区进行固定的或巡回的医疗工作。
    应当保护牲畜，解决饲草饲料不足的困难。发动群众割草储青，并节约饲草。在灾区无法保存的牲畜，应当移畜就草，到非灾区从事运输生产，以畜养畜，以畜养人；或动员非灾区农业生产合作社代为饲养，订立互助合同，使非灾区的农业生产合作社得到使用牲畜的利益，灾区的农业生产合作社也得到适当的报酬。同时并要修理厩棚，使牲畜有地方过冬。
    应当防止灾民盲目外流。加紧开展生产自救、做好救济工作，使灾民看到家乡恢复有望，乐于在家乡参加生产自救运动。对于继续外流的应当加以劝阻，说明盲目逃荒对社会秩序不利，对灾民本身也不利。对于一时不可能容纳许多劳动力的灾区，上级政府应当主动组织劳动力外调，使他们参加外地的临时劳动生产，对于在家乡无法恢复生产的灾民，应当设法另行安置。
