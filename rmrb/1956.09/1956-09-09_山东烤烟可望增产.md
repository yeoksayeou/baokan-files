Xinhua News Agency Report: This year's 1.22 million mu of flue-cured tobacco planted in Shandong Province are all growing very well. According to a survey conducted by the Provincial Department of Agriculture in some areas, it is estimated that the average yield per mu of flue-cured tobacco in the province will reach around 220 jin, an increase of 20% compared to last year, and the total output will increase by about 50% compared to last year.

In order to strive for a bumper harvest of flue-cured tobacco, agricultural production cooperatives in the tobacco-producing areas of Shandong Province have made many efforts. Before the flue-cured tobacco was planted, they strengthened the management of seedbeds. During the growing period of flue-cured tobacco, they carried out timely soil cultivation and topdressing. In addition, the rainfall this year was favorable, so the flue-cured tobacco grew vigorously.

At present, the earlier-maturing flue-cured tobacco in some areas has begun to be marketed. According to statistics from only five counties with more tobacco production, including Yidu, Shouguang, and Tengxian, the agricultural production cooperatives sold more than 121,000 jin of flue-cured tobacco to the state in the five days of late August.

    山东烤烟可望增产
    据新华社讯　山东省今年种植的一百二十二万多亩烤烟都长的很好。据省农业厅在一些地区的调查，估计全省烤烟的每亩平均产量将达二百二十斤上下，比去年增产两成，总产量将比去年增产50％左右。
    山东省各产烟区的农业生产合作社，为争取烤烟丰收，曾作了不少努力。在烤烟栽植前，加强了苗床管理，在烤烟生长期又较适时地进行了培土、追肥，加上今年雨水调和，因此烤烟生长茁壮。
    目前部分地区成熟较早的烤烟已开始上市。仅据产烟较多的益都、寿光、滕县等五个县统计，在8月下旬的五天中，农业生产合作社已卖给国家烤烟十二万一千多斤。
