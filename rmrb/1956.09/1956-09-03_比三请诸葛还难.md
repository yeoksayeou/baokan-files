Even Harder Than Three Visits to Invite Zhuge Liang

On August 12th, a large cart from the Xinguang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Baiquan County, Heilongjiang Province, went to haul sand for the Xiuke Bai Highway (the highway from Keshan to Baiquan). As soon as they arrived in the county town, the horse pulling the cart suddenly fell ill. Liu Fuzhen, the cooperative member driving the cart, led the horse to the branch of the Livestock Hygiene Institute for treatment. The veterinarian gave the horse an injection, but the horse's condition did not improve. The veterinarian said, "We can't treat it here, go to the main institute." Liu Fuzhen led the horse to the main institute. Before they had gone one hundred meters from the branch of the Livestock Hygiene Institute, the horse collapsed. He had to go to the main institute to ask for a veterinarian. Yang Guoshan, a veterinarian from the main institute, reluctantly walked to the horse, took one look, and said, "This horse can be led away, it can still walk. I won't treat it unless it's led to a post." The surrounding people all reached out to help Liu Fuzhen pull the horse up, but the horse still couldn't get up. Liu Fuzhen was sweating profusely with anxiety and pleaded with the veterinarian, "Comrade, please do a good deed, bring your tools and treat it!" By this time, more and more people had gathered around, all looking expectantly at the veterinarian. The veterinarian, looking somewhat embarrassed, walked away without a word. The surrounding people said to Liu Fuzhen, "Go and ask him again, if he doesn't come, get a horse-drawn cart and pull him here." Liu Fuzhen went to the Livestock Hygiene Institute and begged for half an hour, but he still couldn't get the veterinarian to come. The cooperative member was greatly disappointed and returned to the horse, watching the beloved horse with his own eyes. People at the scene said angrily, "Aren't they supposed to serve the people? How can they not care when a horse is so sick it's about to die, even when begged like this!" A cart driver said, "This veterinarian is really hard to get to, they say three visits to invite Zhuge Liang, this is even harder than three visits to invite Zhuge Liang."

At this time, Wang Decheng, a veterinarian from the Livestock Hygiene Institute, came from the street. He heard the crowd's dissatisfied comments about them, and rushed forward aggressively, using both hands to push the crowd apart. He said rudely to Liu Fuzhen, "This horse can't be treated for you, quickly lead it away!" After speaking, he flicked his sleeves and left.

The horse's condition worsened, its belly was severely bloated, and the horse was rolling around in pain. The cooperative member had no choice but to go to the Livestock General Station. It happened that no one was there (it was Sunday). By the time he returned, the horse had died. Liu Fuzhen said sadly, "I feel really bad that our cooperative's horse died like this! If they had really treated it, even if it wasn't cured, we would have been satisfied."

We want to ask: Is the Baiquan Livestock Hygiene Institute a high and mighty yamen of the old society? Or a medical institution that serves the people?

### 比三请诸葛还难

    比三请诸葛还难
    8月12日，黑龙江省拜泉县新光农业生产合作社的一辆大车，去拉修克拜公路（克山到拜泉的公路）用的砂子。刚到县城，车上套的马突然病了，赶车的社员刘福珍牵马到家畜卫生院分所去治疗。兽医给打了一针，马的病不见好。兽医说：“我们这里治不了啦，到总院去吧。”刘福珍牵马到总院去。走到距家畜卫生院不到一百公尺远的地方，马就倒下了。他只好到总院请兽医。总院的兽医杨国山勉强地走到马跟前，一看便说：“这马能牵去，还能走，不牵到桩子跟前不给治。”周围的群众都伸手帮助刘福珍拉马起来，马还是起不来。刘福珍急得满头大汗，又向兽医恳求：“同志，你行点好，把家什拿来给治一治吧！”这时群众越集越多，都期待地望着兽医。这位兽医带着一副窘迫的样子，一声不响地走开了。周围的群众对刘福珍说：“你再去请他一遍，他不来你叫个马车把他拉来。”刘福珍又到家畜卫生院哀求了半个钟头，兽医还是没有请来。那位社员大失所望，回到马的跟前，眼睁睁地看着痛爱的马。在场的人愤怒地说：“他们不是为人民服务的吗？怎么马病得要死，这样请都不管呢！”一个赶马车的人说：“这个兽医真难请，都说三请诸葛，这比三请诸葛还难。”
    这时，从街里走来了家畜卫生院的兽医王德成，他听到群众对他们不满的议论，气势汹汹地上前用双手把群众分开，蛮横地对刘福珍说：“这个马不能给你治了，赶快牵走！”说完了，袖子一甩走了。
    马的病更严重了，肚子膨胀得厉害，马痛得直滚。那位社员没办法，就去找畜牧总站。正好站上没有人（是星期日）。等他回来，马就死去了。刘福珍难过地说：“我们社的这匹马这样死去，我心里真难受！如果他们真给治一治，治不好，我们心里也满意。”
    我们要问：拜泉家畜卫生院究竟是高高在上的旧社会的衙门呢？还是为人民服务的医疗机关？
