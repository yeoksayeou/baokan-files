Planned Improvement of Product Quality in Local Industries
Commentator of this Newspaper

At the beginning of this year, the Tianjin Municipal Local Industry Department formulated a plan to improve product quality, increase new varieties, and new designs. This plan has been implemented for just over half a year, and the physical properties of most products have been improved, some reaching the most advanced level in the country. Some products that were criticized by consumers and were stockpiled last year have now become products praised by consumers and sell well. The new varieties and designs added from January to May this year are about one and a half times the total for the entire last year, and many are first-class products in the country. The experience of Tianjin Municipal Local Industry is worth paying attention to. If the local industry departments of all provinces and cities, based on their own circumstances, seriously formulate and implement plans to improve product quality and increase new varieties and designs, then, while vigorously increasing product output, local industries can rapidly bring product quality up to the advanced level of the country or even foreign countries, ensuring that urban and rural people in our country buy more and better industrial products.

What does a plan to improve product quality and increase new varieties and designs include? Simply put, it means determining the extent to which the physical properties, appearance quality, and percentage of qualified products of existing products should reach within the planning period, how many new varieties and designs should be added, what measures should be taken for this purpose, who should be responsible, and when it should be completed. In order to formulate this plan, the Tianjin Municipal Local Industry Department sent people to conduct extensive social surveys to understand the opinions of trade departments and consumers on existing products; they found the most advanced similar products at home and abroad, and like scientists dissecting animals and plants, they dissected and analyzed them one part at a time to see exactly where they were better than their own products; after finding the shortcomings of the products, they then determined what measures needed to be taken, based on the equipment and technical conditions of the enterprise, to reach or exceed the advanced level at home and abroad. Through dissection and analysis, many people knew more clearly the real situation of the enterprise. Those who previously did not admit that others were advanced and they were backward now admitted it; those who previously admitted that others were advanced but did not know specifically where they were advanced now knew specifically. In short, everyone's minds were clear, and the mood of blind arrogance was greatly reduced. Therefore, the plan not only points out specific goals for all employees to strive for, but also promotes them to consciously learn from the advanced and catch up with and surpass the advanced.

Improving product quality and increasing new varieties and designs is a mass work, but relying solely on the enthusiasm of the masses cannot completely solve the problem. Because at present, the small variety, few designs, and low quality of many enterprises are related to whether the ideology of all employees, especially the leading personnel of the enterprise, pays attention to it, but are more related to the technical strength, equipment conditions, and organizational management of the enterprise. According to statistics from enterprises under the Tianjin Municipal First Light Industry Bureau, technical personnel with certain scientific theories and certain practical experience account for only 1.4% of the total number of employees. The management systems of most factories are unsound, and they lack necessary product quality standards and process regulations; those that have quality standards and process regulations are not fully adapted to the requirements of the new situation, or have not been well implemented. Many factories lack sound quality inspection organizations and personnel. Some factories only inspect finished products and not semi-finished products. Some factories only inspect during the day and not at night. The inspection items are generally incomplete, and there is a lack of necessary instruments. The phenomenon of touching with hands, looking with eyes, smelling with noses, and listening with ears is quite common. Hands have different thicknesses, and vision, hearing, and smell also have different levels of sensitivity, so the inspection results of products with the same quality often vary from person to person and from time to time. The above-mentioned phenomena also exist in other provinces and cities, and some may be even more serious. As the saying goes, "one key for one lock." Problems that belong to ideology should be solved by clearing up ideology, and problems that belong to things other than ideology should be solved by methods other than clearing up ideology. Therefore, when formulating plans to improve product quality and increase varieties and designs, while carrying out in-depth ideological mobilization, it is necessary to formulate various organizational and technical measures to base the plan to improve product quality and increase varieties and designs on reliable technical work and organizational management, and closely integrate it with the technical transformation work of the enterprise. In this way, the plan itself has an organizational force. Seriously implementing this plan will not only make the variety, design, and quality of products焕然一新 (焕然一新 means to take on a completely new look), but also the entire enterprise, the ideological outlook and technical outlook of the people will also be焕然一新 (焕然一新 means to take on a completely new look).

According to the experience of the Tianjin Municipal Local Industry Department, attention should be paid to overcoming right-leaning conservative thinking and also to overcoming "left"-leaning rash advance thinking when formulating plans. Some leading comrades of enterprises, although admitting that their products are indeed not good and need to be improved, raise the question of "where should we advance to?" because they cannot temporarily find samples or technical data of advanced products at home and abroad, and do not want to formulate plans. Some comrades believe that raw materials are not as good as others, and formulating plans is also "a waste of time." For comrades with the former kind of thinking, it is necessary to explain to them clearly that it is also possible to formulate plans to improve product quality based solely on consumers' opinions without advanced product samples and technical data. Sometimes, consumers' requirements may be even higher than the level already reached by advanced products. As for the raw material problem, it should not be an excuse to refuse to formulate plans, because different quality indicators can be formulated according to different raw materials. Moreover, the poor quality of some products is not only due to raw materials, but also to subjective shortcomings. It is always necessary to correct these shortcomings within a time limit and improve product quality.

Contrary to the above two types of comrades, some comrades, after criticizing right-leaning conservative thinking, try to improve all products, large and small, to the most advanced level at once, regardless of the specific conditions, and try to produce all kinds of new products at once. As a result, due to the dispersion of human and material resources, the quality of unimportant products has not been improved, and unimportant new varieties and designs have not been manufactured. Even the improvement of the quality of major products, as well as the trial production of major new varieties and designs, have been delayed. This is what the saying goes, "Haste makes waste." In order to make the plan better guide the actual work, the Tianjin Municipal Local Industry Department has mastered such principles: "Fix the bad ones first, then the good ones; fix the big ones first, then the small ones; fix the export ones first, then the domestic sales ones; fix the ones needed this season first, then the ones needed next season; do a little first, then do a lot." These principles are also worth referencing in various places.

Making a plan is only the beginning of improving quality and increasing varieties and designs. It is like walking ten thousand miles; the plan only tells people where to go, how to go, and what to pay attention to on the road. Before starting, the administrative leaders and Party organizations of the enterprise must mobilize and organize all employees and engineering and technical personnel to realize the plan. After everyone starts walking, they must also frequently check to see if anyone is sleeping soundly on the road (complacency) or if anyone is reaching the destination at all costs (ignoring costs and output)? Sleeping soundly on the way is certainly not good, and spending too much cost is not in line with the Party Central Committee's policy of "more, faster, better, and more economical." Therefore, we should make sure that everyone does not sleep soundly in the middle of the journey, and at the same time, we must carefully calculate the costs to achieve the plan. This is the responsibility of the Party organization and administrative leadership.

    有计划地提高地方工业的产品质量
    本报评论员
    今年年初，天津市地方工业部门制定了关于提高产品质量、增加新品种、新花样的规划。这个规划执行了才半年多，绝大部分产品的物理性能都有所提高，有些已经达到国内最先进的水平。有些去年还受到消费者批评的和积压的产品，现在一变而为得到消费者赞扬的和畅销的产品了。今年1到5月所增加的新品种、新花样，就相当于去年全年的一倍半左右，其中不少还是国内第一流的产品。天津市地方工业的这个经验是值得重视的。如果各省市的地方工业部门都根据自己的情况，认真地制定和执行提高产品质量、增加新品种、新花样的规划，那末，地方工业就可以在大力提高产品产量的同时，使产品质量迅速地达到国内的甚至国外的先进水平，保证我国城乡人民买到又多又好的工业品。
    提高产品质量、增加新品种、新花样的规划，包括哪些内容呢？简单说来，就是在规划期限内，现有产品的物理性能、外观质量、正品率要达到什么样的程度，要增加多少新品种、新花样，为此要采取什么样的措施，由谁来负责，什么时候完成。天津市地方工业部门，为了制定这个规划，曾派人进行广泛的社会调查，了解贸易部门和消费者对现有产品有什么意见；他们把国内外最先进的同类产品找来，像科学家解剖动物植物一样，一个零件一个零件地加以解剖分析，看看它们比自己产品究竟好在哪里；产品的缺点找出来以后，再根据企业的设备和技术情况，确定需要采取什么措施，才能达到或超过国内外的先进水平。通过解剖、分析，许多人更清楚地知道了企业的真实情况，以前不承认别人先进、自己落后的人，现在承认了；以前虽然承认别人先进，但不具体知道先进在哪里的人，现在具体知道了。总之，大家的头脑清醒了，盲目自大的情绪大大减轻了。所以，规划不仅是给全体职工指出了具体的奋斗目标，而且可以推动他们自觉地学习先进，赶上和超过先进。
    提高产品质量，增加新品种、新花样，虽然是一个群众性工作，但是，光靠群众的热情是不能完全解决问题的。因为目前许多企业的品种少、花样少、质量低，跟全体职工，特别是企业领导人员的思想是否重视固然有关系，而跟企业的技术力量、设备条件和组织管理工作有着更大的关系。据天津市第一轻工业局所属企业的统计，具有一定科学理论和一定实际经验的技术人员，只占全体职工总数的1.4％。大部分工厂的管理制度不健全，缺乏必要的产品质量标准和工艺规程；有质量标准和工艺规程的，也不完全适合于新情况的要求，或者没有很好地贯彻执行。不少工厂都缺乏健全的质量检验组织和人员。有些厂只检验成品，不检验半成品。有些厂只白天检查，夜晚不检查。检查的项目一般都不完全，又缺少必要的仪器，用手摸、眼看、鼻子闻、耳朵听的现象相当普遍。手有粗细之分，视觉、听觉、嗅觉也有灵与不灵之别，所以，对质量相同的产品的检验结果，往往因人而别，因时而异。上述各种现象，在别的省、市里也是存在着的，有的可能还要严重些。俗话说得好：“一把钥匙一把锁”，属于思想问题的要打通思想，属于思想以外的问题的，就要用打通思想以外的办法来解决。所以，在制定提高产品质量，增加新品种、新花色的规划的时候，在进行深入的思想动员的同时，必须制定各种组织、技术措施，把提高产品质量、增加品种、花样的计划，建立在可靠的技术工作和组织管理工作的基础上，使它跟企业的技术改造工作紧密地结合起来。这样，规划本身就具有一种组织力量，认真地实现这个规划，不只是产品品种、花样和质量的面貌将要焕然一新，而且整个企业的面貌，人的思想面貌和技术面貌，也都将要焕然一新。
    根据天津市地方工业部门的经验，在制定规划的时候，要注意克服右倾保守思想，也要注意克服“左”倾冒进思想。有的企业领导同志虽然承认自己的产品确实不好，需要改进，但是由于暂时找不到国内外先进产品的样品或技术资料，就提出“叫我们向哪里前进？”的问题来，而不想制定计划。有的同志则认为原材料不如人家的好，制定规划也是“白搭”。对于具有前一种思想的同志，要对他们讲清楚：没有先进产品样品和技术资料，只根据消费者的意见制定改进产品质量的规划也是可以的，有时候，消费者的要求可能比先进产品已达到的水平还要高一些。至于原材料问题，更不应成为拒绝制定规划的借口，因为可以根据不同的原材料，制定不同标准的质量指标。况且有些产品的质量不好，除了原材料的因素以外，还有主观方面的缺点，限期纠正这些缺点，把产品质量提高一步，总是必要的。
    跟上面两种同志相反，有些同志在批判右倾保守思想以后，就不顾具体条件地企图一下子把大大小小的产品都提高到最先进的水平，企图一下子把各种新产品都生产出来。结果呢，由于人力物力的分散，不重要的产品的质量固然没有提高，不重要的新品种、新花样固然制造不出来，就是主要的产品质量的提高，以及主要新品种、新花样的试制工作，也都被耽误了。这就是俗话所说的“欲速则不达”。为了使规划更好地指导实际工作，天津市地方工业部门掌握了这样的原则：“先搞坏的，后搞好的；先搞大的，后搞小的；先搞出口的，后搞内销的；先搞本季需要的，后搞下季需要的；先少搞，后多搞。”这个原则，也是值得各地参考的。
    订好规划只不过是提高质量、增加品种、花样的开始。这好比走万里路，规划只不过是告诉人们往哪里走，怎样走，在路上注意哪些事儿而已。企业的行政领导人和党组织，在开步走以前，要动员和组织全体职工、工程技术人员去实现规划，在大家开步走以后，还要经常检查，看看有没有人在路上睡大觉（自满），有没有人不惜一切代价地（忽视成本和产量）达到目的地？在途中睡大觉固然不好，而费的代价太大，是不符合于党中央提出的“又多、又快、又好、又省”的方针的。所以，我们应该使每一个人都不要在中途睡大觉，同时又要精打细算地实现规划。这就是党组织、行政领导的责任。
