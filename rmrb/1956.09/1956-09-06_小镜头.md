    Small Vignette

    "This little fellow is clever..."
    Mother: I didn't expect the child to learn to swear so quickly!
    Father: Oh, the little fellow has learned to swear? What did he say?
    Mother: Weiwei, what did you say? Let Dad hear.
    Child: (Obviously has forgotten, thinking hard) ...
    Mother: Just now on the road, two children were fighting and said a swear word. As soon as Weiwei heard it, he remembered it and pulled my hand, saying, "Mom, he said 'turtle egg'."
    Child: Turtle egg, turtle egg.
    Father: Hey, this little fellow is quite clever, he learns it as soon as he hears it. But swearing is bad, you are not allowed to say it again.
    Child: (Very interested, curious) Turtle egg, turtle egg...
    Dad, Mom: (Sternly) Not allowed to say it again! (The child shows a crying face.)
    Mother: Weiwei is a good boy, won't say it again. Mommy will give you candy.
    Child: (Having received the candy, runs out the door cheerfully, singing as he says it again.) Turtle egg, turtle egg...
