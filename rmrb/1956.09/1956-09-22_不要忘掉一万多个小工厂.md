Don't Forget the Ten Thousand Small Factories
By our reporter Xi Ping

Recently, I visited some very small so-called "alley factories" in Shanghai and spoke with some of the workers and cadres in these factories. During my visits, they almost all expressed the same sentiment: they hope that the government and Party leadership, while concerned about the large factories, will also keep the thousands upon thousands of small factories in their sights and help the workers in small factories solve some pressing difficulties.

The call of the workers and cadres in small factories deserves sympathy. During my visits, I witnessed that the working and living conditions in some small factories are indeed very poor. The office of the Shanghai Penglai District Federation of Trade Unions, when inspecting summer cooling measures not long ago, found that the workshop temperature in many small factories reached around 140 degrees Fahrenheit. One small factory called Gongxing Sand Casting Factory is located right next to the road. When the furnace is fired up, sparks fly onto pedestrians on the road. To ensure the safety of pedestrians, workers had to close the factory doors to operate in this year's unusually hot summer in Shanghai. In some small factories in Penglai District, occupational diseases have not been effectively prevented and treated, seriously threatening the health of workers. The labor protection section of the district federation of trade unions once made a rough estimate that more than 70% of the employees in the electroplating industry in the district suffer from chromic acid poisoning, and 25% of the workers have developed more serious conditions like nasal perforation. In a lead smelting factory called Hanyu Mao, nine out of the twenty-four workers in the factory suffered from lead poisoning, often experiencing stomach pain, dizziness, and general weakness. The living conditions in many small factories are very poor, the factory buildings are unsafe, and the dormitories are excessively crowded. I visited a can-making factory called Shengtai in Zhabei District. The eleven workers in the factory all slept on a small "loft" in the workshop. The floor was only two or three feet away from the roof. Workers had to crawl in to sleep. This "room" also housed four people with lung disease. In many sand casting workshops, workers have no fixed place to sleep for a long time, only a bed board. Wherever there is space, they put it there. In winter, it may be placed on a cooled furnace, and in summer, it is on the road.

The political and cultural life of the workers in these small factories is also relatively poor. For many small factories, no cadres have come down for years, and the workers do not hear necessary political and current affairs reports. Some factories have neither a Party branch nor a Communist Youth League group. When I visited Zhabei District, workers told me that more than 60,000 workers live in Zhabei District, but there is still no workers' club.

Small factories account for a large proportion of Shanghai's industry. According to the Shanghai Municipal Statistics Bureau's June statistics, among the more than 20,000 factories in Shanghai, there are 13,400 small factories with 4 to 30 employees. Small factories are not only large in number, but their role in the national economy is also not to be underestimated. Many small alley factories produce high-quality and high-grade products. The aluminum metal atmospheric pressure hoses manufactured by the jointly-owned Hua'an Machinery Factory are indispensable parts on airplanes, and the quality is relatively good, with heat resistance generally above 200 degrees Celsius. However, the factory has a total of only nine employees, including workers and the private factory director. In Shanghai's Zhabei District, there is a Yunji ribbon factory with twenty-nine workers, and the quality of the typewriter ribbons it produces exceeds that of imported goods. Many small factories are also indispensable supporting factories for heavy industry production, undertaking supporting tasks for more than 160 key construction projects across the country. For example, Ruizhao Ji Factory in Xincheng District, with only eleven employees, is currently the only factory in the country that produces automobile speedometers for the Jiefang brand truck. The screws and nails produced by some small factories in Shanghai are sold to many important construction sites and foreign markets across the country. If these small factories do not produce well, their impact will definitely not be small.

The difficult situation of most small factories in Shanghai was not created today, but was formed before the joint state-private ownership. Although these enterprises have now implemented joint state-private ownership, the evils left over from the old enterprises cannot be eliminated overnight. They must be gradually improved through economic reorganization and enterprise transformation over a considerable period of time. However, does this mean that we can ignore all the difficulties of the workers in small factories today? Of course not. We should also adopt a positive attitude and help them solve some urgent and solvable problems. I once visited Yulin District, where small factories are more concentrated. More than 70,000 employees directly participate in production in this district, and there are nearly 200,000 family members of employees. However, comrades here told me that there is only one small hospital with sixteen beds in the entire district. Because there are more monks than porridge, it is difficult for workers in small factories to see a doctor. Often, they register one day and see a doctor the next day. Workers say, "We can't afford the time or the money." This often leads to small illnesses becoming big illnesses, and big illnesses turning into emergencies. Problems like this should be addressed by the Shanghai health department and relevant leading departments. Another example is the workers' club that more than 60,000 workers in Zhabei District have been looking forward to. It has been said that it will be built for a long time, but it has been delayed. What workers are dissatisfied with is the style of delaying things that can obviously be done with various excuses.

It is impossible to completely change the labor equipment conditions of these factories in a short period of time, but some problems can be solved with very little money as long as we are good at relying on the masses. I visited the Weichang Weaving Factory in Luwan District. This factory led more than 20 small factories at the same time in the process of economic reorganization of joint state-private ownership. Many small factories were manually operated with wooden machines, the labor intensity was high, 12% of the workers suffered from hernia, and 10% of the workers suffered from lung disease. For a long time, no one cared about them. Recently, the Party branch of the Weichang Weaving Factory mobilized workers to improve equipment, and everyone was in high spirits. They said, "Our machines are backward, but our thinking is not backward." Encouraged by the Party branch, the workers came up with various good ways to improve the equipment. A worker from Zhenfeng Tan Cotton Weaving Factory bought an old bead plate for three cents at the old goods market and installed it on the wooden loom, reducing the labor of the worker by one-third when pedaling the machine. The branch of the Weichang Weaving Factory also suggested that the administration make appropriate adjustments to the labor force and provide appropriate care for those who cannot engage in heavy labor. Although these seem to be small things, they have had a good impact on the workers. They said, "Now the light of socialism has finally shone on our small factories." However, this is not the case for most. Some leading organs one-sidedly emphasize "maintaining the status quo" and waiting for economic reorganization, without mobilizing the masses. They do not do things that can be solved by moving their hands and mouths. A small machine factory in Zhabei District was in disrepair for a long time, so that the house and machines vibrated badly when the lathe was turned on, seriously threatening the safety of workers. The workers have proposed more than once to properly reinforce the machine foundation, but it has not been resolved for a long time. Now, when the machine is turned on, two people must hold the frame on both sides of the machine, otherwise, there will be danger. Electroplating workers in Penglai District said: A year ago, we asked the health department to tell us some methods and knowledge to prevent chromium poisoning, but there has been no news until now. Is this also impossible?

Some leading organs also treat small factories unfairly in some aspects. For example, often only workers from large factories are sent to sanatoriums, while workers from small factories are not. New worker villages are only allocated to workers from large factories, but not to workers from small factories. Advanced producers are also more often selected from large factories, and workers from small factories are often overlooked. Some comrades in the districts said: These seem to be small things, but the impact is not small. Because the leading organs lack due care for medium and small factories, it has also caused some ideological confusion among some cadres and workers. For example, some cadres are not willing to work in small factories, and when the leadership transfers them to small factories, they think they are "being punished for making mistakes." Some workers want to jump to large factories, thinking that there is no future in small factories.

Although attention has been paid to the lives of the working masses, attention is often paid more to large factories and less to small factories. It is absolutely necessary to care about the lives of workers in large factories, but generally speaking, the living difficulties of workers in small factories are more than those of workers in large factories, so their demands are more eager. Solving the difficulties of small factories may be more troublesome than large factories, but we should not let difficulties tie our hands and feet.

    不要忘掉一万多个小工厂
    本报记者　习平
    最近，我参观了上海的一些规模很小的所谓“弄堂工厂”，接触了这些厂里的一部分工人和干部。在参观中他们几乎都向我反映了这样的呼声：要求政府和党的领导机关在关心大工厂的同时，也把成千成万的小工厂放在他们的视野之内，也给小厂的工人们解决一些急待解决的困难。
    小厂工人和干部们的这个呼声是应该得到同情的。我在参观中，目击一部分小厂的劳动条件和生活条件确实是太差了。上海蓬莱区工会联合会办事处在不久前，检查夏季降温工作的时候，曾发现许多小厂的车间温度竟达到华氏一百四十度左右。有一个名叫公兴翻沙厂的小工厂，厂址就在马路旁边，炉子一开火，火星就飞到马路上的行人身上，为了照顾行人的安全，在今年上海百年少有的酷暑中，工人们只好把厂门关起来操作。在蓬莱区某些小厂里，职业病没有得到有效的预防和治疗，严重地威胁着工人的健康。区工会联合会办事处的劳保科曾经做了一个粗略的统计，在全区电镀行业中，患铬酸中毒的职工达70％以上，其中病情较为严重，发展为鼻穿孔病的工人已经有25％。在一个名叫韩裕茂的冶铅厂里，全厂二十四个工人中，有九个人中铅毒，他们经常患着肚痛、头晕、全身无力等病。不少小工厂的居住条件很坏，厂房不安全，宿舍过分拥挤。我曾参观了闸北区一个名叫升泰的制罐厂，这个厂的十一个工人都睡在工场的小“搁楼”上，楼板距离屋顶只有两三尺高，工人睡觉时，必须钻进去，这个“房子”里，还同时睡着四个有肺病的人。在许多翻沙作坊里，工人长期没有固定睡觉的地方，只有一块铺板，哪里有空，就放在哪里，冬天可能搁在退了火的炉子上，夏天就在马路上。
    这些小厂工人的政治生活、文化生活也比较贫乏。很多小厂是经年累月没有干部下来的，工人们听不到必要的政治、时事报告。有的厂既没有党的支部，又没有团的小组。我在闸北区访问的时候，工人告诉我：闸北区住着六万多工人，但直到目前还没有一个工人俱乐部。
    小工厂在上海工业中占着很大的比重，据上海市统计局六月份统计，上海两万多个工厂中，三十人以下，四人以上的小型工厂有一万三千四百个。小工厂不仅数量大，它在国民经济中的作用也是不可轻视的，许多小弄堂工厂里出产着品质优等的高级产品。公私合营华安机械厂制造的铝质金属大气压软管，是飞机上不可缺少的零件，质量也比较好，耐热度一般在摄氏二百度以上。但这个厂的职工和私方厂长一共只有九人。在上海闸北区有一个二十九个工人的云基织带厂，出产的打字带质量超过了进口货。也有许多小厂是重工业生产不可缺少的协作厂，担负着全国一百六十多项重点建设工程的协作任务。如新成区有一家瑞兆记厂，全厂仅十一人，现在它是全国唯一为解放牌汽车生产汽车里程表的工厂。上海一些小厂出产的螺丝和铁钉，行销全国许多重要工地和国外市场。如果这些小厂生产得不好，它们的影响绝不是很小的。
    上海绝大多数小厂的困难状况不是今天才产生的，而是在公私合营之前就形成了，这些企业虽然现在已实行了公私合营，但是旧企业所遗留下来的这些恶果，却不可能在一个早晨就扫除干净，必须在一个相当的时间内，通过经济改组和企业改造才能逐步地改善。但是，这是不是说，小厂工人们的一切困难今天我们都可以置之不理了呢？当然不能，我们还应当采取积极的态度，帮助他们解决一些迫切需要解决和可能解决的问题。我曾经参观了小工厂较为集中的榆林区，这个区里住着直接参加生产的职工七万余人，职工家属近二十万人。但这里的同志告诉我：全区只有一个包括着十六张病床的小医院。由于粥少僧多，小厂的工人看病就很难，常常是一天挂号，一天看病。工人说“我们陪不起工夫，也陪不起钱。”这样就常常形成小病变大病，大病转危急。像这样的问题，上海卫生部门和有关领导部门是应当设法加以解决的。又如前面说过的闸北区六万多工人盼望的工人俱乐部，早就说要办，却一直拖着不办。工人们所不满意的就是对这些明明可以办到的事情，却以种种借口拖延不做的作风。
    要在短时间内彻底地改变这些厂的劳动设备状况，这是办不到的，但是有些问题只要善于依靠群众，就可以花很少的钱获得解决。我曾访问了芦湾区的玮昌织布厂，这个工厂在公私合营经济改组过程中，同时领导二十多个小厂，许多小厂都是用木机手工操作的，劳动强度高，有12％工人患了疝气病，10％工人生了肺病，长久以来，没有人去关怀他们。最近，玮昌织布厂的党支部发动工人来改进设备，大家情绪很高。他们说：“我们机器落后，人的思想可不落后。”工人们在党支部的鼓励下，想出了各种改善设备的好办法。振丰坦棉织厂一个工人用了三角钱到旧货市场上买了一只旧的弹子盘，装到木织机上，工人在蹬机子的时候减轻了劳动力三分之一。玮昌织布厂的支部同时还建议行政对劳动力作了适当的调配，对不能从事重劳动的给予适当的照顾。虽然这些看来都是小事，但在工人中发生了很好的影响。他们说：“这下社会主义的光芒总算照到我们小工厂的头上来了。”但是，像这样做的还不是多数。有的领导机关片面地强调“维持现状不动”，等待经济改组，不去发动群众，明明有些事动动手、动动口就可以解决的，也不去做。闸北区有一个小的机器厂，因年久失修，以致车床一开屋子和机器都震动不堪，严重威胁工人的生命安全。工人们不止一次地提出：将机器基础适当地加固，但很久以来，却没有得到解决，现在机器一开动，必须要用两个人在机器的两边扶架着，否则就会发生危险。蓬莱区的电镀工人说：一年前，我们就要求卫生部门告诉我们一些防止铬中毒的方法和知识，但直到现在没有任何消息，难道这也是办不到的吗？
    有的领导机关对小工厂的有些待遇也不尽合理，如送工人去疗养的常常只有大厂工人，而没有小厂工人。工人新村只分配大厂工人居住，而不分给小厂工人。先进生产者也是大厂选出多，小厂工人常被忽视等等。一些区的同志说：这些看来似乎是小事情，影响却不小。由于领导机关对中、小厂缺乏应有的关怀，在部分干部和工人中也造成了一些思想上的纷乱。如有的干部不安心在小厂工作，当领导上把他调到小厂去的时候，就认为是“犯了错误受处分”。有些工人要跳到大厂去工作，认为在小厂永无出头之日。
    关心工人群众的生活现在虽然已引起重视了，但常常是对大厂注意得多，对小厂注意得少。关心大厂工人的生活是完全必要的，但一般说来，小厂工人的生活困难是比大厂工人更多一些，因此他们的要求也更殷切一些。解决小厂的困难可能要比大厂麻烦些，但我们不应当让困难缚住自己的手脚。
