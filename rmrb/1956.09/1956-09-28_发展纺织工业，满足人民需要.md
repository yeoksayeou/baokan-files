Development of the Textile Industry to Meet the Needs of the People

Speech by Comrade Qian Zhiguang, Vice Minister of Textile Industry

Now I would like to offer some opinions on the issue of developing the textile industry to meet the needs of the people.

The Current Situation of the Textile Industry

Over the past seven years, under the correct leadership of the Party, and while the state has prioritized the development of heavy industry, the textile industry has also experienced rapid growth. During the First Five-Year Plan period, the national textile industry grew by 80 percent, with an average annual growth rate of 12.5 percent. By the end of 1957, the number of cotton spindles put into production nationwide will reach 7.5 million, an increase of 2.36 million compared to 1949, equivalent to 46 percent of the total construction of the cotton spinning industry in the fifty years before liberation. In 1956, cotton yarn production will reach 5.1 million bales, an increase of 1.8 times compared to 1949; wool fabric production in 1956 increased by 6.5 times compared to 1949; silk textile production doubled; and linen textile and knitwear reproduction products have also experienced significant growth. The development of the textile industry has played its due role in meeting the needs of the people, accumulating funds for the country, and stabilizing prices.

As the living standards of the people have continuously improved, the sales volume of textiles has been increasing in recent years. In 1950, the sales volume of cotton cloth was 56.47 million bolts, which reached 93.56 million bolts in 1952. It is estimated that it will increase to 177 million bolts in 1956, an increase of more than 2 times compared to 1950 and an increase of 0.9 times compared to 1952. People not only demand an increase in the quantity of textiles, but also require improvements in the quality of textiles; they not only need more cotton textiles, but also increasingly need wool, linen, silk, rayon, and other textiles. Compared with 1952, knitwear reproduction products increased by 1.4 times in 1956; various printed fabrics increased from 7 million bolts to more than 29 million bolts, an increase of more than 3 times; and worsted wool fabrics increased by 2.1 times. The vast majority of the Chinese population, the peasants, after increasing their income, in addition to solving the problem of food and using it for expanded reproduction, mainly use the remaining income to purchase various textiles. Now, more and more people in rural areas are buying textiles such as gabardine, twill, and printed cloth; and the number of people using towels, wearing underwear, and woolen sweaters is also constantly increasing. This phenomenon of wanting more and better is an inevitable trend of the people's increasingly improved lives in our country.

In recent years, although we have done some work in increasing the production of textiles, improving product quality, and increasing varieties and patterns, and production has greatly increased, compared with the total output of cotton yarn from various countries in the world, we are not considered low. However, due to China's large population and large demand, the speed of production growth is far from meeting the increasing needs. If we look at the current equipment and product quantity of China's textile industry, the level is still quite low. In 1956, the cotton spindles put into production in China were only 70 percent of those in the Soviet Union and 60 percent of those in India; the average amount of cotton cloth per person in 1956 was 30 meters in the Soviet Union, about 16 meters in India, while China only had 9 meters; other wool, linen, silk, and other textiles, the average amount per person in China is even less.

In order to meet the growing needs of the country and the people for textiles, we must appropriately accelerate the development of the textile industry during the Second Five-Year Plan period.

The Guiding Principles of the Second Five-Year Plan

In the political report of the Central Committee and the report on the proposal for the Second Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy, it was proposed that under the state's economic construction policy centered on the development of heavy industry, the textile industry should be further developed, which we believe is completely correct.

Developing the textile industry can not only meet the needs of the people, but also accumulate construction funds for the country more quickly. During the First Five-Year Plan period, the national textile industry accumulated nearly 10 billion yuan for the country (including industrial profits and taxes), equivalent to about 38 percent of the total industrial investment of the state's First Five-Year Plan. Now, building a cotton textile factory with 100,000 spindles and 3,500 looms requires a total investment of 35 million yuan. After it is officially put into production, it will take only one year to recover the entire investment (including industrial and commercial profits and taxes). The recovery time for printing and dyeing, wool textile factories, etc., is even faster. This speed and quantity of accumulation are beneficial to the development of our country's industry. As Comrade Shaoqi pointed out in his report, appropriately paying attention to the development of light industry will not only not affect the construction of heavy industry, but also benefit the development of heavy industry.

During the Second Five-Year Plan period, it is necessary to conduct technological transformations of existing enterprises in a planned and focused manner in order to continue to unleash their production potential. Over the past seven years, the increase in textile production has mainly relied on and unleashed the potential of existing enterprises. In 1956, 85 percent of cotton yarn production was produced by old factories. As for printing and dyeing, knitwear, wool, silk, and other textiles, almost all of them were produced by old factories. At present, the equipment utilization rate of old factories in the cotton spinning industry has reached 97 percent. The unit output of cotton yarn in the first half of 1956 increased by 29 percent compared to 1949. However, according to this year's production level, the equipment utilization of cotton spinning, printing, wool textile, and linen textile has been quite tight. In the future, relying solely on unleashing the potential of existing enterprises will not be able to meet the needs. Therefore, during the Second Five-Year Plan period, it is necessary to actively build new textile industries on the basis of agricultural development.

The construction of new factories must be rationally deployed so that the distribution of the textile industry gradually becomes more rational. At the same time, attention must also be paid to combining it with the economic reorganization of existing enterprises. All newly built textile factories should, according to the design and manufacturing level of our country's equipment, try to adopt advanced equipment with short process flows and high production efficiency to ensure that the new factories have higher labor productivity. In order to meet the diverse needs of the people and fully utilize the raw material resources of the textile industry, in addition to continuing to build new cotton textile factories during the Second Five-Year Plan period, the proportion of wool, linen, silk, and other textile industries should also be appropriately increased. The rayon industry is an emerging textile industry sector that is developing rapidly in various countries around the world. In some relatively developed textile industries, rayon accounts for about 30 to 35 percent of their total fiber production, but at present, it is still in the experimental stage in our country and must strive to catch up. Although our country's wood pulp production is not large, cotton linter resources are very abundant, which is a favorable condition for the development of the rayon industry. During the Second Five-Year Plan period, a foundation should be laid for the development of the rayon industry.

In order to ensure the completion of the Second Five-Year Plan for the textile industry, it is necessary to continue to strengthen the technical forces in capital construction and machinery manufacturing. After several years of efforts, we have organized a team that can undertake certain tasks in design, construction, and installation, and have also accumulated some experience in work. The construction time of new factories has been greatly shortened. At present, the construction of a cotton textile factory, if materials and equipment can be supplied in a timely manner according to needs, will shorten the construction period by about six months compared to 1953, and the project cost will also be greatly reduced, and the project quality will also improve year by year. In terms of textile machinery manufacturing, after several years of efforts, we can now produce complete sets of cotton textile equipment of 700,000 spindles per year, which will reach 1 million spindles in 1957, and the manufacturing cost of machinery is decreasing year by year. However, the number of new types of equipment that need to be designed and manufactured in the future is very large and there are many types. Some of the world's latest technologies and equipment, such as equipment for the rayon industry, cannot be designed and manufactured by us at present; civil engineering and process design are also becoming increasingly complex and numerous. The existing technical forces in capital construction design and mechanical design and manufacturing are far from meeting the needs of future development. It is necessary to make efforts in various aspects, with the cooperation and assistance of relevant departments, to further increase the technical forces in capital construction and textile machinery manufacturing.

The development of the textile industry must also actively solve the problem of increasing and reserving raw materials. Most of the raw materials of the textile industry depend on agriculture. The speed of agricultural development not only directly affects the speed of development of the textile industry, but also the quality of raw materials is related to the quality of textiles. In order to meet the needs of developing the textile industry in the future, we hope that agricultural departments, agricultural product procurement departments, and comrades in various regions, while paying attention to increasing grain production, will also pay attention to increasing the production of textile raw materials, improving the quality of raw materials, and improving supply work, such as improving sheep breeds and improving wool quality, so that our country can achieve self-sufficiency in wool for worsted spinning as soon as possible; increasing silkworm cocoons and improving silkworm cocoon quality; improving cotton ginning work and reducing cotton impurities, etc., and appropriately increasing raw material reserves on the basis of increased production.

In order to meet the people's requirements for textiles, it is necessary to produce a greater quantity and a greater variety of cotton, wool, linen, silk textiles and blended fabrics. To accomplish this task, all employees of the textile industry need to make more and greater efforts in production and capital construction.

In the national textile industry, the textile industry managed by local authorities accounts for a large proportion, and many industries have close ties with local authorities. In the future, the construction tasks of the textile industry will be very heavy. Therefore, strengthening the connection and cooperation between the central government and local authorities and giving play to the enthusiasm of local authorities is of great significance. The Ministry of Textile Industry has had many shortcomings and errors in its past work. In the future, under the call of the Eighth National Congress of the Party and under the leadership of the Party Central Committee, we are confident that we will correct our shortcomings and errors and better complete the task of developing the textile industry as stipulated in the Second Five-Year Plan.

    发展纺织工业，满足人民需要
    纺织工业部副部长　钱之光同志的发言
    现在我就发展纺织工业，满足人民需要的问题，发表一些意见。
    纺织工业的现状
    七年来，在党的正确领导下，在国家优先发展重工业的同时，纺织工业也有了较快的发展。在第一个五年计划期间，全国纺织工业增长了百分之八十，平均每年增长速度为百分之十二点五，到一九五七年底，全国投入生产的棉纺锭将达到七百五十万枚，比一九四九年增加了二百三十六万枚，等于解放前棉纺工业五十年建设总数的百分之四十六。一九五六年棉纱产量将达到五百一十万件，比一九四九年增加了一点八倍；毛织品产量，一九五六年比一九四九年增加了六点五倍；丝纺织品增加了一倍；麻纺织、针织复制等产品亦有很大的增长。纺织工业的发展，对供应人民需要、为国家积累资金以及稳定物价等，都起了应有的作用。
    由于人民的生活水平日益提高，几年来纺织品的销售量是不断增加的，一九五○年棉布销售量为五千六百四十七万匹，一九五二年就达到了九千三百五十六万匹，一九五六年预计将增加到一万七千七百万匹，一九五六年比一九五○年增加了二倍多，比一九五二年增加了零点九倍。人民不仅要求增加纺织品的数量，而且要求提高纺织品的质量；不仅需要更多的棉纺织品，而且对毛、麻、丝、人造纤维等纺织品的需要也日益增加。一九五六与一九五二年比较，针织复制品增长了一点四倍；各种印花布从七百万匹增加到二千九百多万匹，增加了三倍多；精纺毛织品增加了二点一倍。占我国人口最大多数的农民，在增加收入以后，除解决吃的问题和用作扩大再生产外，其余的收入主要是用来购买各种纺织品。现在农村中购买华达呢、斜纹、印花布等纺织品的人，已日渐增多；用毛巾、穿卫生衣及毛线衣的人，也不断增加。这种要多、要好的现象，是我国人民生活日益改善的必然趋势。
    几年来，我们在增加纺织品的生产和提高产品质量、增加花色品种方面，虽然作了一些工作，生产有了很大的增长，以棉纱的总产量同世界各国比较起来，我们并不算低，但由于我国人口多，需要量大，生产增长的速度还远不能适应日益增长的需要。如果从目前我国纺织工业的设备与产品数量来看，水平还是相当低的。一九五六年我国投入生产的棉纺锭仅为苏联的百分之七十，为印度的百分之六十；一九五六年平均每人分得的棉布数量，苏联为三十公尺，印度约为十六公尺，而我国还只有九公尺；其他毛、麻、丝等纺织品，我国平均每人分得的数量更少。
    为了满足国家和人民对纺织品日益增长的需要，在第二个五年计划期间，我们必须适当地加速纺织工业的发展。
    第二个五年计划的方针
    在中央委员会的政治报告、和关于发展国民经济的第二个五年计划建议的报告中，提出在国家以发展重工业为中心的经济建设方针下，应进一步发展纺织工业，我们认为是完全正确的。
    发展纺织工业，不仅可以满足人民需要，而且可以较快地为国家积累建设资金，在第一个五年计划期间，全国纺织工业为国家积累了将近一百亿元（包括工业利润和税收），相当于国家第一个五年计划工业投资总额的百分之三十八左右。现在新建一个十万纱锭，三千五百台布机的棉纺织厂，共需投资三千五百万元，在正式投入生产以后，只要一年的时间，即可收回全部投资（包括工业、商业利润和税收）。印染、毛纺织厂等，收回的时间还要快一些。这种积累的速度和数量，对发展我国工业是有利的。正如少奇同志在报告中所指出的，适当地注意发展轻工业，不仅不会影响重工业的建设，而且有利于重工业的发展。
    在第二个五年计划期间，必须有计划有重点地对原有企业进行技术改造，以继续发挥其生产潜力。七年来，纺织品生产的增加，主要是依靠和发挥原有企业的潜力。一九五六年的棉纱产量中，有百分之八十五是由老厂生产的，至于印染、针织、毛、丝等纺织品，则几乎全靠老厂生产。目前棉纺工业的老厂设备利用率，已经达到百分之九十七。棉纱的单位产量，一九五六年上半年比一九四九年提高了百分之二十九。但是依照今年的生产水平，棉纺、印花、毛纺织、麻纺织等设备利用情况已经相当紧张。今后光靠发挥原有企业的潜力，已不能满足需要。因此在第二个五年计划期间，必须在农业发展的基础上，积极地建设新的纺织工业。
    建设新厂要进行合理的部署，使纺织工业的分布逐步走向合理，同时还要注意和原有企业的经济改组相结合。新建的各种纺织厂，均应根据我国设备的设计制造水平，尽量采用工艺过程短、生产效能高的先进设备，以保证新厂有更高的劳动生产率。为了满足人民多种多样的需要和充分利用纺织工业的原料资源，在第二个五年计划期间，除继续建设新的棉纺织厂外，还应该适当地增加毛、麻、丝等纺织工业的比重。人造纤维工业是一个新兴的纺织工业部门，世界各国都发展很快，在某些纺织工业比较发达的国家，人造纤维约占它们各种纤维总产量的百分之三十至三十五，但目前在我国还在试验阶段，必须努力赶上。我国木浆产量虽然不多，但棉绒资源是很丰富的，这是发展人造纤维工业的有利条件。在第二个五年计划期间，应当为发展人造纤维工业打下基础。
    为了保证完成纺织工业的第二个五年计划，必须继续加强基本建设与机械制造的技术力量。经过几年来的努力，我们在设计、施工和安装方面，已经组织了一支可以担负一定任务的队伍，同时在工作方面也积累了一些经验，新厂的建厂时间已大大缩短，目前建设一个棉纺织厂，如果材料、设备等能够按照需要及时供应，将比一九五三年缩短工期约六个月，工程造价亦大大降低，工程质量也逐年提高。在纺织机械制造方面，经过几年来的努力，现在已可年产成套棉纺织设备七十万锭，一九五七年将达到一百万锭，机器制造成本逐年都在降低。但是，今后需要设计制造的新型设备数量很大，种类很多，有些世界上最新的技术和设备，如人造纤维工业的设备等，我们目前还不能设计和制造；土建、工艺设计亦日趋复杂、繁多，按现有的基本建设设计和机械设计制造的技术力量，都远不能适应今后发展的需要。需要在有关部门的配合和协助下，从各方面努力，来进一步增加基本建设和纺织机械制造的技术力量。
    发展纺织工业，还必须积极解决原料的增产和储备问题。纺织工业的大部分原料都取决于农业，农业发展速度的快慢，不仅直接影响到纺织工业的发展速度，而且原料质量的好坏，也关系到纺织品质量的高低。为了适应今后发展纺织工业的需要，我们希望农业部门、农产品采购部门和各地同志，在注意增产粮食的同时，也注意增产纺织原料，提高原料质量和改善供应工作，如改进羊种、提高羊毛质量，使我国精纺用毛能够及早自给；增加蚕茧，提高蚕茧质量；改进棉花的轧制工作，减少棉花含杂等等，并在增产的基础上，适当增加原料的储备。
    为了满足人民对纺织品的要求，需要生产数量更大，品种花色更多的各种棉、毛、麻、丝纺织品和交织品。要完成这个任务，还需要纺织工业的全体职工在生产和基本建设方面，作更多更大的努力。
    在全国纺织工业中，由地方管理的纺织工业，占了很大的比重，许多行业同地方的关系都很密切。将来纺织工业的建设任务很大，因此加强中央同地方的联系配合，发挥地方的积极性，就有重要的意义。纺织工业部过去在工作中的缺点和错误很多，今后，在党的第八次代表大会号召之下，在党中央的领导下，我们有信心改正缺点和错误，更好地来完成第二个五年计划所规定的发展纺织工业的任务。
