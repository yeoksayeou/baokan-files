Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: China's young ball bearing industry will soon be able to obtain automated ball-lapping machines from its own country. The first domestically produced ball lapping machine was successfully trial-produced on the 2nd at the state-owned Shanghai Machine Tool Plant.

This ball lapping machine, trial-produced according to the new Soviet model from 1954, is fully automated. One worker can supervise three machines, each capable of lapping 300 kilograms of cast steel balls at a time. Balls of various specifications, ranging from 3 mm to 32 mm in diameter, can be lapped. During the test run on the 2nd, technical appraisal personnel used a "micrometer" to check the precision of the balls it produced, and all met the specified standards – the ovality and facetting did not exceed 2.5 microns (equivalent to one twenty-fourth the thickness of an average human hair).

The Shanghai Machine Tool Plant trial-produced this new type of lapping machine in response to the needs of China's developing ball bearing factories. The first sample will be sent to the Leipzig Exhibition in Germany. The second sample, currently undergoing evaluation, has already been ordered by a ball bearing factory.

    国产滚珠磨床试制成功
    据新华社讯　我国年青的滚珠轴承工业，不久就可以从本国得到自动化的磨滚珠的机器。第一台国产的滚珠磨床，2日已经在国营上海机床厂试制成功。
    这种按照苏联1954年出产的新型号试制的滚珠磨床，完全是自动化的，一个工人可以看管三台，每台一次能磨三百公斤钢铸的滚珠；直径三公厘到三十二公厘的各种不同规格的滚珠，都可以磨制。2日在试车的时候，技术鉴定人员用“测微计”检查了它磨制的滚珠的精密度，全部符合规定的标准——椭圆度和棱面度都不超过二点五公微（相当普通头发的二十四分之一粗细）。
    上海机床厂根据我国发展轴承工厂的需要，试制了这种新型磨床。第一台样品将送到德国莱比锡展览。正在进行鉴定的第二台样品，已经由滚珠轴承厂定购。
