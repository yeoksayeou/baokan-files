Xinhua News Agency, 19th—China's democratic parties and non-party democratic figures held a symposium in Beijing this morning to protest the West German authorities' anti-peace and anti-democratic atrocities of persecuting the German Communist Party.

The First Secretary of the German Communist Party, Mr. Reimann, and the member of the Central Committee of the German Communist Party, Mr. Herzner, were invited to attend the symposium.

The symposium was presided over by Li Jishen, Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang. In his speech, he said that the West German authorities' atrocities of persecuting the German Communist Party were exactly the same as those of Hitler, and that they were attempting to obstruct the unification of the German people. However, peace-loving people all over the world, especially the Chinese people and the democratic parties of China, sympathize with the people of West Germany and support the struggle of the German Communist Party. He said that Germany is an excellent nation, which has made great contributions to the world in science and technology, but the reactionary German government caused great disasters to the German people in the First and Second World Wars.

At the beginning of the symposium, Li Jishen invited Reimann, the First Secretary of the German Communist Party, to talk about the West German authorities' persecution of the German Communist Party. Reimann first expressed his gratitude to the democratic parties of China for holding this symposium. He said that this symposium is a support for the German Communist Party, which is being persecuted by the West German authorities. He said that Adenauer is militarizing the West German people just like Hitler, persecuting German Communists, and destroying West German democratic groups and progressive organizations. But the German people do not want war, do not want to kill their compatriots, and German youth do not want to be soldiers, they want to study. Reimann also said that the West German authorities wanted to persecute us and forcibly occupied our offices and printing plants, but after we went underground, comrades were everywhere, newspapers appeared in factories, and our radio station broadcast three times a day. These all show how we are carrying out our work. He said that our struggle is not only supported by the German people, but also by the people of China and the world. The German people must take the road to freedom and democracy.

Zhang Bojun, Chairman of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party, said that the reactionary measures of the Adenauer authorities are actions that endanger world peace, hinder German unification, and harm the German state. Today, the situation in Germany and the world situation are completely different from ten years ago. Times have changed, and Adenauer is bound to fail if he wants to follow Hitler's old path.

Shen Junru, Chairman of the China Democratic League, said that when he went to East Berlin five years ago, he saw the German people voting for the unification and removal of the boundaries between East and West Germany. He believes that the German people are completely willing to unite, and he believes that Germany can definitely be unified and the German people's revolution can definitely succeed. After his speech, he gave two newspaper clippings of his speeches protesting the West German authorities' persecution of the German Communist Party to Reimann, and warmly shook hands with Reimann and Herzner, wishing the German Communist Party and the German people victory in their struggle.

Chen Shutong, a non-party democrat, said that the persecution of the Communist Party and democratic parties also occurred in reactionary-ruled China. However, the result of this oppression was not the weakening of the revolutionary forces, but the more rapid expansion of the revolutionary movement. The German Communist Party cannot be banned by the reactionary government, and the forces led by the German Communist Party will surely achieve final victory.

Xu Deheng, Chairman of the Jiusan Society, said that the West German authorities' banning of the German Communist Party under the direction of imperialism is a provocation to peace-loving people all over the world, and people all over the world will not tolerate this provocation. He expressed strong protest against this provocation by the Adenauer authorities. He said that two rallies protesting the illegal actions of the West German authorities are being held in Beijing at the same time today, expressing the Chinese people's firm protest and attention to this issue.

Luo Longji, Vice Chairman of the China Democratic League, Hu Ziang, Deputy Director of the China National Democratic Construction Association, Zhang Xiruo, a non-party democrat, Zhou Jianren, Vice Chairman of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, Chen Qiyou, Chairman of the China Zhi Gong Party, and Xie Xuehong, Chairman of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League, all attended today's symposium.

    我国各民主党派和无党派民主人士举行座谈会
    抗议西德当局反和平反民主的暴行
    新华社19日讯　中国各民主党派和无党派民主人士今天上午在北京举行座谈会，抗议西德当局迫害德国共产党的反和平反民主的暴行。
    德国共产党第一书记雷曼和德国共产党中央委员赫茨纳应邀出席了座谈会。
    座谈会由中国国民党革命委员会主席李济深主持。他在会上致词说，西德当局迫害德国共产党的暴行和希特勒完全一样，它企图阻挠德国人民的统一。但是爱好和平的全世界人民，特别是中国人民和中国各民主党派都同情西德人民，支持德国共产党的斗争。他说，德国是优秀的民族，在科学技术方面对世界有很大的贡献，但是德国反动政府在第一次和第二次世界大战中，使德国人民遭受了很大的灾难。
    在座谈会开始的时候，李济深请德国共产党第一书记雷曼谈谈西德当局迫害德国共产党的情况。雷曼首先对中国各民主党派召开这个座谈会表示感谢。他说，这个座谈会对正处在西德当局迫害中的德国共产党是一种支持。他说，阿登纳对西德人民进行军国主义化和希特勒完全一样，迫害德国共产党人，摧残西德民主团体和进步组织。但是德国人民不愿意战争，不愿意残杀自己的同胞，德国青年不愿意当兵，他们要求学习。雷曼又说，西德当局想迫害我们，强占了我们的办事处和印刷厂，但是我们转入地下后到处是同志，报纸在工厂出现了，我们的广播电台每天广播三次，这些都说明了我们如何在进行工作。他说，我们这种斗争不仅德国人民支持我们，中国、全世界人民都支持我们。德国人民一定要走向自由、民主的道路。
    中国农工民主党主席章伯钧说，阿登纳当局的反动措施，是危害世界和平、妨碍德国统一和损害德国国家的行动。今天，德国的情况和世界的形势已经完全和十年前不同了，时代已经变了，阿登纳要走希特勒的老路是一定要失败的。
    中国民主同盟主席沈钧儒说，五年以前到东柏林的时候，正看到德国人民要求统一、去掉东西德界限的投票。他认为德国人民是完全愿意团结的，他相信德国一定是可以统一的，德国人民的革命是一定能够成功的。他发言完毕以后，把两份在报纸上发表的抗议西德当局迫害德国共产党的谈话的剪报送给了雷曼，并且同雷曼和赫茨纳热烈握手，预祝德国共产党和德国人民的斗争取得胜利。
    无党派民主人士陈叔通说，共产党和民主党派受迫害的事，在反动统治的中国也有过。但是，这种压迫的结果不是革命力量削弱了，而是革命运动更加迅速地扩大了，德国共产党不是反动政府禁止得了的，德国共产党领导的力量一定能够取得最后的胜利。
    九三学社主席许德珩说，西德当局在帝国主义指使下取缔德共的行为是对全世界爱好和平人民的一个挑衅，全世界人民将不能容忍这种挑衅。他对阿登纳当局的这种挑衅表示了强烈的抗议。他说，今天北京同时举行了两个抗议西德当局非法行动的集会，表示中国人民坚决抗议的情绪和对这个问题的注意。
    中国民主同盟副主席罗隆基，中国民主建国会副主任委员胡子昂，无党派民主人士张奚若，中国民主促进会副主席周建人，中国致公党主席陈其尤，台湾民主自治同盟主席谢雪红都出席了今天的座谈会。
