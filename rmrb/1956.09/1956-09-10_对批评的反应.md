Reactions to Criticism

    After reading the article "Aimless Telegrams" published on page 4 of the People's Daily on August 3rd, we immediately conducted a review. Regarding the telegram on February 29th concerning the spirit of the Provincial Greening Work Telephone Conference, although the main content was to deploy tasks for greening the Yangtze River and the Han River, it also arranged for greening the highways. It was necessary to send it to Jingmen. However, for the other two telegrams, we believe the readers' criticism is correct. The emergence of this aimless phenomenon is mainly due to carelessness of the cadres when drafting. They did not precisely specify which departments to send to based on the content of the telegram, but simply wrote "Sent to the People's Committees of all counties" in a general way. The responsible comrades did not pay attention to reviewing when signing and issuing, resulting in units that should not have been sent also receiving them.

    对批评的反应
    读了人民日报8月3日四版发表的“无的放矢的电报”一文后，我们当即作了检查，除2月29日关于传达省绿化工作电话会议精神的电报，虽然主要内容是布置绿化长江、绿化汉江任务，但还布置有绿化公路的问题，有必要发到京山外；其他两个电报，我们认为读者的批评是对的。这种无的放矢现象的产生，主要是干部拟稿时粗枝大叶，没有根据电文内容，确切地写明发往那些机关，只是笼统地写送各县人民委员会，负责同志在签发时又没有注意审核，以致不该发的单位也发了。
