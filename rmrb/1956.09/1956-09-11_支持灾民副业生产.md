    Supporting Disaster Victims' Sideline Production
    (Our report) This newspaper reports that the Supply and Marketing Cooperative of Fuliqu District, Su County, Anhui Province, in order to assist disaster-stricken farmers in self-salvation through production, recently transferred twelve cadres to various township agricultural cooperatives to investigate the situation of sideline production. According to the situation of production and sales and the possible supply of raw materials, the district will develop 29 kinds of sideline industries this winter and next spring, including oil pressing, mat weaving, fishing, and brick making; more than 5,100 laborers are engaged in sideline production.
    At present, the Fuliqu District Supply and Marketing Cooperative is planning to organize the processing of raw materials for local farmers and open up sales channels. The preliminary plan is to purchase raw materials such as white willow branches and reeds to organize farmers to process strip baskets, willow crafts, reed mats, etc. These measures of the supply and marketing cooperative will effectively support local farmers in overcoming the disaster.

    支持灾民副业生产
    本报讯　安徽省宿县符离区供销合作社为协助受灾农民生产自救，在最近抽调干部十二人到各乡农业社调查副业生产情况。根据产销和原料可能供应情况，全区在今冬明春将开展的副业有榨油、编席、捕鱼、烧砖等二十九种；从事副业生产的劳力有五千一百多人。
    目前，符离区供销合作社正在筹划为当地农民组织加工原料，打开销路。初步计划收购白柳条、芦苇等原料，组织农民加工条筐、柳活、芦席等。供销社的这些措施，将有力地支持当地农民度过灾荒。
