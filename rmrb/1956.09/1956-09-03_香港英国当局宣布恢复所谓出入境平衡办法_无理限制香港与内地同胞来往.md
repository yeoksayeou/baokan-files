Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, September 2nd: On August 31st, the Hong Kong British authorities announced the resumption, starting September 3rd, of the so-called entry-exit balance measures, which had been abolished for more than half a year. This has once again unreasonably restricted travel between Hong Kong and mainland compatriots. Disregarding the fact that negotiations between the Hong Kong and Guangdong authorities on resuming direct passenger train service between Guangzhou and Kowloon had basically reached an agreement, and that negotiations on the issue of Chinese people entering and leaving Hong Kong were underway, the Hong Kong British authorities actually took this unilateral and unreasonable action.

The entry and exit of Chinese people into and out of Hong Kong is a long-standing tradition and practice of more than a century. On April 28, 1950, the Hong Kong British authorities, disregarding this traditional right of the Chinese people, treated Chinese people the same as other foreign immigrants and imposed arbitrary restrictions. The Chinese government protested against this unfriendly and unreasonable behavior of the Hong Kong British authorities. On March 5, 1955, the Hong Kong British authorities further implemented the "balanced entry and exit" measures, restricting the number of Chinese people entering and leaving Hong Kong to a daily balance, putting traffic between Hong Kong and the mainland in an extremely difficult situation. This caused great inconvenience to the people of Hong Kong and the mainland, and caused them many economic losses. The Chinese government has firmly demanded that the Hong Kong British authorities abolish this unreasonable restriction. For example, last year, more than 15,000 Hong Kong compatriots who came to Guangzhou from Hong Kong were unable to return to Hong Kong due to the above-mentioned restrictions and remained in Guangdong. In addition to actively assisting Hong Kong compatriots in obtaining convenient travel conditions, the Guangdong Provincial People's Government adopted relief measures to help Hong Kong compatriots remaining in Guangdong solve the difficulties during their stay, or assisted them in returning to their hometowns.

Since February 10, 1956, in order to facilitate travel between the two regions, the Guangdong Provincial People's Government completely abolished the exit and entry permits for Hong Kong compatriots. Under these circumstances, the Hong Kong British authorities stopped the restrictions on balanced entry and exit, and Hong Kong compatriots were completely unrestricted in their travel to and from the mainland. Therefore, during the Spring Festival, as many as four to five thousand people returned to the mainland from Hong Kong every day to visit relatives and friends. In half a year, more than 300,000 Hong Kong compatriots returned to the mainland. In order to provide Hong Kong compatriots with more convenient travel conditions, the Guangzhou Railway Administration negotiated with the Hong Kong Railway Authority in February on the restoration of direct passenger train service between Guangzhou and Kowloon. An agreement had basically been reached on the traffic arrangements, but at the request of the Hong Kong British authorities, the relevant authorities of Guangdong and Hong Kong held negotiations on the entry and exit of Chinese people into and out of Hong Kong. When the negotiations had achieved some agreements, and both parties agreed to continue consultations to seek solutions on other issues, the Hong Kong British authorities took unilateral action and announced that they would re-implement the unreasonable "entry and exit balance" measures on September 3, restricting travel between Hong Kong and mainland compatriots.

    香港英国当局宣布恢复所谓出入境平衡办法
    无理限制香港与内地同胞来往
    新华社广州2日电　8月31日，香港英国当局宣布从9月3日起重新实行早已撤消了半年多的出入境平衡办法，使香港与内地同胞的来往又重新受到不合理的限制。香港英国当局不顾香港与广东省有关当局间关于恢复广州与九龙直通客车的谈判已基本达成协议，关于中国人民进出香港问题的谈判正在进行的事实，竟然采取了这种片面的不合理的行动。
    中国人民出入香港，是百余年来长期存在的传统和惯例。1950年4月28日，香港英国当局不顾中国人民的这一传统权利，竟将中国人民与其他外国移民一律看待，横加限制。中国政府对香港英国当局这种不友好与不合理的行为曾提出抗议。1955年3月5日，香港英国当局进一步实行了“平衡出入”的办法，限制中国人民进出香港人数必须逐日平衡，使香港与内地间的交通陷入极其困难的境地。这给香港和内地人民造成极大的不便，并给他们造成许多经济上的损失。中国政府曾坚决要求香港英国当局取消这一不合理限制。例如去年香港同胞从香港来广州后，因上述限制无法回港而留在广东的曾达一万五千多人。广东省人民政府除积极协助香港同胞取得来往便利条件外，对于留在广东的香港同胞曾采用救济办法帮助他们解决滞留期间的困难，或协助他们回乡。
    1956年2月10日起，广东省人民政府为便利两区间的旅行，完全取消香港同胞出入境通行证办法，在这种情况下香港英国当局始停止了平衡出入的限制，香港同胞来往内地才完全不受限制。因此，在春节期间，每日从香港回内地探亲、访友的多达四五千人。半年间香港同胞回来内地的，即达三十多万人。广州铁路管理局为提供香港同胞更多的来往便利条件，2月间与香港铁路当局谈判恢复广州与九龙间直通客车问题。关于通车办法本已基本达成协议，但由于香港英国当局的要求，广东省与香港有关当局又举行了关于中国人进出香港的谈判。当谈判已获得若干协议，对其它问题双方亦均同意继续协商谋求解决的时候，香港英国当局竟采取片面行动，宣布在9月3日重新实施“出入平衡”的不合理办法，限制香港与内地同胞的来往。
