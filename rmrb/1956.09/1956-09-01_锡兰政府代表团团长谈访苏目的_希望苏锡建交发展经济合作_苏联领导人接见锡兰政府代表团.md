Xinhua News Agency, August 31st, Moscow dispatch from TASS: Mr. Corea, head of the Ceylonese government delegation and Ceylon's High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, at the request of a reporter from "Soviet Russia," spoke on August 30th about the delegation's purpose in visiting the Soviet Union and the content of the Ceylonese representatives' meetings in Moscow.

Corea said that our delegation is the first government delegation from Ceylon to visit the Soviet Union in Ceylon's history. We hope to resolve four issues in Moscow:

First, to establish diplomatic relations between our two countries and discuss the mutual dispatch of diplomatic missions;

Second, to reach an agreement on the development of trade;

Third, to develop economic cooperation between our two countries;

Fourth, to promote mutual understanding between our two countries through cultural exchange.

All these issues are under smooth discussion.

The hospitality we have received in Moscow can be described in one word: cooperation. This word embodies the friendly and sincere treatment we have received here. The Soviet representatives are very sincere in the negotiations, which makes one feel that they genuinely hope to reach an agreement.

Our approach during the negotiations is based on the fundamental principles of Ceylon's foreign policy. The foundation of these principles is friendship with all countries, commitment to peaceful resolution of problems, sincerity, and cooperation for world peace.
