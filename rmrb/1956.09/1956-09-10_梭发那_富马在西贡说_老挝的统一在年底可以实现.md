Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 9th: Saigon dispatch: Lao Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma said in Saigon on the 8th that Laos' foreign policy is one of strict and cautious neutrality.

Phouma arrived in Saigon on the 8th for a twenty-four-hour visit. At a press conference, he said: "We have always adhered to India's Five Principles policy. We are willing to respect the sovereignty of others, and we also hope that they respect our sovereignty."

He went on to say that Laos hopes to maintain good relations with all its neighbors, which is why he is visiting South Vietnam. He also said that his visit will also dispel the "misunderstandings" caused by his recent visits to China and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

Phouma met with Ngo Dinh Diem on the same day. Phouma said that the purpose of the meeting was to develop trade between Laos and South Vietnam.

Phouma also said that his country is willing to accept economic assistance from all countries, as long as such assistance does not contain any meaning of interfering in Lao sovereignty.

He said that during his recent visit to Beijing, China did not force Laos to accept aid, but only expressed its willingness to provide such aid. He said that Laos has not yet decided whether it will request economic assistance from China.

He also said that the Soviet Union has contacted Laos regarding the exchange of diplomatic envoys, but Laos has not yet made any decision on this matter.

Speaking of internal affairs, the Lao Prime Minister said that the delegation of the Lao Fighting Forces is expected to arrive in Vientiane on September 15 to reach a final agreement on the issue of Lao unification. Phouma believes that the unification of Laos will be fully realized by the end of this year, but not sooner.

Phouma has already left Saigon for Paris today to report on the situation in Laos to the Lao King who is in France.

    梭发那·富马在西贡说
    老挝的统一在年底可以实现
    据新华社河内9日电　西贡消息：老挝首相梭发那·富马8日在西贡说，老挝的外交政策是一种严格而谨慎的中立政策。
    富马8日到达西贡进行二十四小时的访问。他在记者招待会上说：“我们一贯遵守印度的五项原则政策。我们愿意尊重别人的主权，我们也希望他们尊重我们的主权。”
    他接着说，老挝希望同所有的邻国保持良好的关系，这就是他访问南越的原因。他又说，他的访问也将消除由于他最近访问中国和越南民主共和国而引起的“误会”。
    富马在当天曾经同吴庭艳举行了会谈。富马说，会谈的目的是要发展老挝和南越的贸易往来。
    富马还谈到，他的国家愿意从一切国家接受经济援助，只要这种援助不含有干涉老挝主权的意义。
    他说，在他最近访问北京的时候，中国并没有强迫老挝接受援助，而只是表示愿意给予这种援助。他说，老挝还没有决定它是否将要求中国给予经济援助。
    他又说，苏联已经就互派外交使节的问题同老挝进行接触，但是老挝还没有对此作出任何决定。
    这位老挝首相在谈到内部事务时说，寮国战斗部队代表团可望在9月15日来到万象，就老挝统一问题取得最后协议。富马相信，到今年年底老挝的统一将可以完全实现，但是不可能更早。
    富马已经在今天离开西贡前往巴黎，向正在法国的老挝国王报告老挝局势。
