Japanese Translated and Annotated Publication of "Manwen Laodang" (Old Manchu Archives)

"Manwen Laodang I: Taizu 1," translated and annotated by the Japanese Manwen Laodang Research Society, was published last August by the Toyo Bunko (Oriental Library) as the twelfth volume of the Toyo Bunko Series. The translators and annotators are Kiyoshi Wada, Tatsuro Yamamoto, Keiji Okamoto, and Minobu Honda. The Manwen Laodang (Old Manchu Archives) is a collection of original historical materials left over from before the Qing Dynasty entered the Pass, and it is extremely useful for studying the early history of the Qing Dynasty and the Manchu language. These old archives are stored in the Chongmo Pavilion of the Shenyang Imperial Palace and the Palace Museum in Beijing. Due to language limitations, researchers of Qing history have rarely utilized them. This book uses the circled and dotted version photographed by Naito Torajiro of Kyoto University in the Chongmo Pavilion of the Shenyang Imperial Palace as its base text, and transliterates it into Roman spelling according to Mullendorff's "Manchu Grammar" phonetic method. Each word is directly translated word-by-word, and each paragraph is followed by a general free translation. The Manchu place names, country names, ethnic group names, official positions, systems, etc., are all translated into Chinese. The included years range from 1607 to 1621. The second and third volumes of the Taizu period will also be published in succession. The fourth volume and subsequent volumes of the Taizong period are also being translated and organized. (Ran)

    日本译注出版“满文老档”
    日本满文老档研究会译注的“满文老档Ⅰ太祖1”，去年八月由东洋文库出版，列为东洋文库丛刊第十二种。译注者是和田清、山本达郎、冈本敬二、本田实信等人。满文老档是清朝入关前遗留下来的原始史料，对于研究清初史实和满族语文用处极大。这些老档分别藏在沈阳故宫崇谟阁和北京故宫。研究清史的人由于语文的限制，很少利用过。这本书以京都大学所藏内藤虎次郎在沈阳故宫拍摄的有圈点本作底本，依据穆林德夫的“满语文法”的音译方式转写成罗马拼音。每语之下有逐语直译，每段之后有总的意译。对于满文的地名、国名、民族名、官职、制度等，也都加以汉译。所包含的年代是从1607年到1621年。太祖朝的第二、三卷也将顺次出版。第四卷以下的太宗朝，也正在翻译整理中。　（然）
