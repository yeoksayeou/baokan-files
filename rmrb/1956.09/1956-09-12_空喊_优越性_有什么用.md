What’s the Use of Empty Slogans About "Superiority"?
Hui Zhi

During the summer harvest, some agricultural cooperatives in Wanrong County, Shanxi Province, asked individual farmers to save wheat seeds for them. The reason was that continuous rain had caused the cooperative's wheat to mold and sprout, making it unusable for seeds. At that time, the individual farmers asked the cooperative members: "Aren't you an agricultural cooperative? Why do you need us to save seeds for you?" The cooperative members replied angrily: "This is the 'superiority' of the cooperative!"

What was going on? Didn't agricultural cooperatives have superiority? Didn't the farmers believe in the superiority of agricultural cooperatives? No, that's not it. Now, whether it's cooperative members or individual farmers, very few people doubt that cooperatives have superiority. Especially after the realization of advanced cooperativization, the favorable conditions for developing production in the cooperative are even greater, and the superiority is even greater. Take the Jinxing Agricultural Cooperative led by Li Shunda as an example. In July and August, they suffered successive attacks from hail, storms, and floods, damaging 80%-90% of the autumn fields, estimating a reduction of more than 300,000 jin of autumn grain. In the past, such a large disaster would have forced many people to rely on relief or flee elsewhere. Now it's different. The Party branch and the cooperative's management committee made reasonable plans for the cooperative's six hundred plus laborers, and within a few days, they completed the tasks of replanting, supporting seedlings, applying fertilizer, and weeding. Now most of the crops have gradually returned to normal, and the cooperative has revised its sideline production plan to engage in more sideline production. By autumn, the combined income from agriculture and sideline production can make up for more than 296,000 jin of grain, only about 5,000 jin short of the original plan.

Being both cooperatives, why was the cooperative in Wanrong County worse off than individual farmers? It's a long story. The ripening of wheat in this area progresses from south to north, and local farmers have a tradition of helping each other harvest wheat, generally completing the harvest in three or four days. If the local leaders could fully utilize the favorable factors after cooperativization and organize north-south mutual assistance more and better, even if it rained continuously, they would have been able to harvest in time. However, they thought, "We have cooperativization, what's there to fear?" and didn't actively organize the cooperative members to harvest, resulting in the harvest being delayed for more than ten days. The huge loss came about in this way, and the cooperative members were angry about this. The problem is very clear: after the realization of cooperativization, there are objectively many favorable conditions; however, if human subjective effort is not added, what "benefit" can these "favorable conditions" have? It's just a "condition."

Now, the busy autumn harvest and planting season has begun, and disaster-stricken areas also need to drain water, repair dikes, and tidy up their homes. There are indeed many things to do. If the labor force is not well organized, it is likely that one thing will be neglected for another. It is said that when some staff members, cooperative cadres, or cooperative members reflect to them that there are many things to do and not enough labor, they do not help analyze the reasons and find solutions, but instead criticize the people who make suggestions, saying: "Where has the superiority of cooperativization gone? You really can't see the essence of things." Who exactly can't see the essence of things? What exactly is the essence of superiority? A knife is a good knife, but if it is left unused, it will rust, and if it is used improperly, it will hurt one's own people. Stop just shouting "Good knife, good knife!" You'd better study carefully the specific methods to make the sharp knife play its full role!

    空喊“优越性”有什么用
    慧之
    夏收期间，山西万荣县有的农业社曾要求单干农民替他们留麦种。原因是阴雨连绵，社里小麦霉烂发芽，不能做种了。当时单干农民问社员说：你们不是农业社吗，怎么还要我们替你留种籽呢？社员愤慨地回答说：这就是合作社的“优越性”啊！
    怎么回事呢？农业社没有优越性吗，农民不相信农业社的优越性吗？不是的。现在不管社员还是单干农民，很少有人怀疑合作社有优越性。特别是实现高级合作化以后，社里发展生产的有利条件更多，优越性也更大。拿李顺达所领导的金星农业社来说，七、八月间，他们接连遭受冰雹、暴风和洪水的袭击，80％—90％的秋田被损坏，估计要减产秋粮三十多万斤。要是在过去，遭这样大的灾，不知要有多少人依赖救济或者出外逃荒。现在不同了。党支部和社的管理委员会把全社六百多个劳动力进行了合理的规划，几天之内便突击完成补种、扶苗、追肥、除草等工作。现在大部庄稼已逐渐恢复正常，社内又修订了副业生产计划，多搞些副业生产，到秋后农副业两项共可弥补上二十九万六千多斤粮食，比原计划只差五千多斤。
    同样是合作社，万荣县的社为什么还不如单干户呢？说来话长。这个地区小麦的黄熟是由南向北的，当地农民本来就有互助割麦的习惯，一般三、四天便收割完毕。如果当地领导干部能充分利用合作化以后的有利因素，更多更好地组织南北互助，纵使阴雨连绵，也是能够抢收得及的。可是，他们认为“合作化了，还怕什么”，不积极组织社员抢收，结果，拖了十几天也没收完。巨大的损失就是这样来的，社员气忿的也就是这个。问题很清楚，实现合作化以后，客观上是具备了很多有利条件；但是，如果不加上人的主观努力，“有利条件”又能有什么“利”呢，它只不过是个“条件”罢了。
    现在，繁忙的秋收秋种季节已经开始，遭灾地区还要排水修堤，整理家园，事情的确不少。如果不很好地组织劳动力，就很可能顾此失彼。据说，有些工作人员，当社干部或者社员向他反映事多劳力少的时候，他们并不帮助分析原因、找出解决办法，却只是批评提意见的人说：“合作化的优越性到哪儿去了？你们真是看不见事物的本质。”究竟是谁看不见事物的本质呢？优越性的本质究竟是什么？刀是好刀，放着不用也会生锈，用之不当也会伤害自己人。别光喊“好刀，好刀！”还是好好研究研究使锋利的好刀充分发挥作用的具体方法吧！
