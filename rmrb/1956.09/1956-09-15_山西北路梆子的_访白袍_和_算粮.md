Shanxi Northern Road Bangzi Opera's "Visiting the White Robe" and "Calculating Grain"
    Bai Yunsheng
    On the 6th, I watched the Northern Road Bangzi Opera "Visiting the White Robe" and "Calculating Grain" from the Xinxian Special District of Shanxi Province. The Kunqu Opera troupes also perform "Visiting the White Robe." Jingde rewards the army is called "Visiting the Robe," and there's also White Robe visiting Jingde, also known as "Fishing." Kunqu Opera legends also include "The Story of the Golden Sable," narrating the story of the White Robe, Xue Rengui, and Yuchi Gong. Peking Opera has "Xue Li Sighing at the Moon" and "Dumuguan," which also come from the same story, but the performance styles are different. In the Northern Road Bangzi performance, the veteran artist Comrade Dong Fu plays Yuchi Gong. His performance, whether it's the facial expressions, the physical skills, or the use of his eyes, is full of expressive power that conveys inner emotions, and the audience is strongly moved, which is worthy of our learning. After hearing the soldier mention the news about the White Robe, he rushed away on horseback in a hurry. When he discovered the hoof marks on the road, under the moonlight, because his eyes were a little dim due to his age, he used his eyes to look down and used his hand gestures to mimic the hooves, his whole body slightly shaking to show that he was reining in the horse to make it walk steadily. Then he whipped the horse to go quickly, looked at the ground again, showing that he traveled a distance and found horseshoe traces again. When he saw someone standing there, he somersaulted off his horse, his body swaying slightly, took two steps back, and pounded his waist, indicating that he was old and decrepit. Only when he was riding the horse was he full of energy, and only when his feet touched the ground did he feel tired. This point was acted very carefully, with a strong sense of life. When he saw Xue Li's back, he used his eyes and hand movements, extending his thumbs and exaggerating the movements by rotating them left and right with the rhythm of the music, expressing his inner admiration for this young hero. This scene was performed wonderfully, no wonder there was thunderous applause from the audience.
     "Calculating Grain" is a scene that is lightly touched upon in other opera genres, but Northern Road Bangzi can perform it for more than an hour, with heavy emphasis on singing, recitation, and acting. Comrade Jia Guilin, who plays Wang Baochuan, has a voice that is wide, bright, and round, and she has plenty of breath. Some of her long drawn-out tunes and the many cleverly turned tunes were all sung in one breath, which aroused applause from the audience. A thirteen-year-old girl sitting next to me asked, "How can this person have such a long breath?" This question made me think about whether we are studying the science of traditional singing methods. With such a good singing method and such skillful use of breath like Jia Guilin, I think it is very necessary for vocal music comrades to learn from her and study her techniques.
    In terms of performance, Comrade Jia Guilin also has her unique skills. For example, when Prime Minister Wang tells Baochuan that Pinggui is dead and there is no need to return to the cold kiln, she turns her face to her father, pretending to be sad, and then twists her head and smiles in an instant, conveying Baochuan's mood at that time in a concise and delicate way: Pinggui has returned, but her father doesn't know yet, but she doesn't want to reveal it in person, so she has to pretend to be sad, but she can't help but laugh secretly in her heart. Such a rapid change of sorrow and joy, and making it clear to the audience, cannot be achieved by actors without profound artistic cultivation.
    Ya Babai, who plays Prime Minister Wang, also performed appropriately in terms of footwork, demeanor, singing, and recitation. Father and daughter slapped each other eighteen years ago, which has become a thing of the past. Since Baochuan has come to celebrate his birthday, she is, after all, his own daughter, how could he not feel pity? Therefore, at this time, Prime Minister Wang both loves and hates her, and the actor grasps this complicated mood reasonably and expresses love prevailing over hatred, which is very well done, unlike other opera genres that portray Prime Minister Wang as cold and ruthless.
    Zhang Yin, an old gentleman, plays Wei Hu. The 67-year-old artist still has a very good voice, but it is a pity that he sings a little fast, and the words cannot be heard clearly.
    In the traditional singing method of Hua Lian in Bangzi Opera, there is a method of using "exploded sounds." If it is not sung well, it will sound harsh and uncomfortable. Some people say that using exploded sounds will ruin the voice of nine out of ten people. However, after listening to the singing methods of Mr. Zhang Yin and Mr. Dong Fu, who use exploded sounds, it does not feel harsh. Instead, it makes the characters' personalities more prominent. These two are very old and have been singing for many years, but their voices have not been ruined, which shows that singing with exploded sounds will not necessarily ruin the voice. It is very necessary for vocal music comrades to study this point as well.
    In addition, in their performances, I also feel that there is a little inadequacy, that is, the water sleeve skills of general actors seem to need to be strengthened. If the water sleeves are used skillfully, it will greatly help the external beauty of the characters, and it will also have an effect on expressing the inner emotions of the characters. The ancients said: Long sleeves are good for dancing. Because classical opera emphasizes both singing and dancing, the skill of water sleeves is very important.

    山西北路梆子的“访白袍”和“算粮”
    白云生
    我在6日看了山西省忻县专区北路梆子的“访白袍”和“算粮”。“访白袍”这个戏，昆高腔班也有。敬德赏军为“访袍”，还有白袍访敬德，亦名“钓鱼”；昆曲传奇还有“金貂记”，叙述白袍薛仁贵和尉迟恭的故事；京戏有“薛礼叹月”、“独木关”，也出于同一故事，但表演上的风格不同。北路梆子的演出，由老艺人董福同志扮尉迟恭。他的表演，不论是脸上的表情，身上的功夫，还是眼神的运用，都富有传达内心情感的表现力，给观众的感染非常强烈，值得我们学习。他听到小卒说出白袍的消息后，急不择路地跨马奔驰而去，及至在路上发现了马蹄痕迹，在月光下，又因上了年纪双目有点昏花，所以用足眼神俯视，而且用手的动作来比拟马蹄，全身用力微晃，表现出勒住马缰，使马稳步而行；随后又加鞭急行，又看地下，表现行了一程又发现有马蹄迹。到看见有人站在那边时，他翻身下马，身躯微晃，倒退两步，用手捶腰，表示年老龙钟，方才是骑着马精神抖擞，及至下马双脚着地才感觉劳累了。这一点演得很细致，生活气息很浓。看到薛礼背影时，用眼神动作和双手伸出大拇指，随着音乐节奏左右旋转的极夸张的手法，表现了对这个少年英雄的内心赞赏的情绪。这场戏演得十分精彩，无怪台下掌声四起了。
     “算粮”这出戏，在其它剧种中是轻描淡写的场子，而北路梆子则能演一点多钟，唱、念、作都很吃重。贾桂林同志扮演王宝钏，嗓子又宽、又亮、又圆，而且气足，有些拖腔很长然后又拐了许多巧腔的唱法，都是一口气贯下来，引起了满场的掌声。我身旁坐着一个十三岁的女孩子问我说：“这个人怎么有这样长的气？”这一问使我想到我们正在研究传统唱法是否科学的问题。像贾桂林这样好的唱法，这样会用气，我以为搞声乐的同志就很有向她学习和研究的必要。
    在表演上，贾桂林同志也有独到的地方。例如王丞相向宝钏说平贵已死，不必再回寒窑时，她脸向父亲假装悲泣，一刹那间又扭头微笑，简练而又细致地传达了当时宝钏的心情：平贵已回，父亲还不知道，可是当面不愿说破，只好假装悲泣，但心中又忍不住暗笑。这样一悲一喜的急遽变化，而且作得要观众一目了然，不是有高深艺术修养的演员是不能做到这样鲜明的。
    亚八百扮演的王丞相，在步法、气度和唱念等方面，也都演得恰如其分。父女击掌已经十八年，已成过去，宝钏既来拜寿，毕竟是亲生女儿，岂有不怜惜的，所以这时候王丞相是又爱又恨，演员把这种复杂的心情掌握得入情入理，而且表现出爱胜过恨，作得很好，不像其它剧种把王丞相演成冷酷无情。
    扮演魏虎的是张银老先生。六十七岁的老艺人，嗓子依然很好，可惜唱得快了一些，听不清词句。
    梆子戏的花脸传统唱法上有用炸音的，唱不好使人听着刺耳不舒服。有人说用炸音十人有九人要唱坏嗓子。可是听了张银和董福二位老先生使用炸音的唱法，并不感到刺耳，而是使人物性格更突出了；这二位年纪都很大了，唱了很多年，嗓音并没有坏，可见唱炸音并不一定会坏嗓子。这一点搞声乐的同志也很有必要研究一下。
    此外，在他们的演出中，我也有一点感到不足的地方，即一般演员的水袖功夫似乎应当加强。水袖要是运用得利落，对人物的外形美大有帮助，对于表达人物的内心情感也有作用；古人云：长袖善舞。因古典戏曲是歌舞并重，因此水袖功夫是很重要的。
