I completely agree with the Central Committee's political report, the report on amending the Party Constitution, and the report on the Second Five-Year Plan for developing the national economy. The Central Committee's political report scientifically summarizes the brilliant achievements and experiences of the Party in leading the Chinese people's revolution since the Seventh National Congress. This is a victory of the close integration of the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism and the actualities of the Chinese revolution. From the "Seventh National Congress" to the "Eighth National Congress," the Party conducted multifaceted activities during this period of significant historical importance. The Party led the people in arduous struggles, finally defeating powerful enemies at home and abroad, thoroughly completing the great democratic revolution, and basically achieving the great socialist revolution. The Party is leading the people in the arduous socialist construction and socialist transformation, and the development of the First Five-Year Plan for the national economy is being completed ahead of schedule and overfulfilled.

    A Paramount Important Issue in China’s Socialist Industrialization

The implementation of the First Five-Year Plan demonstrates that the Party's line for China's socialist industrialization is entirely correct. As long as we resolutely implement the Party's line, it is entirely possible to basically complete China's socialist industrialization in about fifteen years and build China into a great socialist country. However, to accomplish such an arduous task, there must be capital accumulation commensurate with it, and the way to achieve accumulation, determined by the essence of China's social system, can only rely on domestic accumulation. Thus, the amount and speed of accumulation not only directly affect the speed of socialist industrialization, but also directly affect the people's consumption level and the degree of improvement in their lives. Therefore, correctly resolving the relationship between accumulation and consumption is a paramount important issue in China's socialist industrialization process.

In the past few years, our handling of the relationship between accumulation and consumption has been basically correct, but certain deviations have also occurred. Practice has proven that when we handle the relationship between accumulation and consumption relatively well, the country's economic life exhibits coordinated phenomena, which have a favorable impact on the development of industry and other economic sectors, and the improvement of people's lives. Conversely, when our handling of the relationship between accumulation and consumption is not adequate, China's economic life appears abnormal, and the development of industry, the development of other economic sectors, and the improvement of people's lives are adversely affected.

Therefore, based on the experiences of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, and especially based on the practice of our country's construction, the Party requires that in carrying out China's socialist industrialization, on the one hand, we must adopt a higher speed to prioritize the development of heavy industry, and on the other hand, we must actively develop agriculture and light industry; on the one hand, we must practice strict economy to accumulate more construction funds, and on the other hand, we must correspondingly raise the level of consumption so that the people's lives are gradually improved. Is it possible to do this? It is possible. The practice of China's economic construction in the past few years is a good proof.

    First, from the four years of 1953-1956
(with 1952 as 100), China's industrial production increased by 104 percent, with an average annual growth rate of 19.5 percent; China's agricultural production increased by 19 percent, with an average annual growth rate of 4.4 percent. In industrial production, the average annual growth rate of heavy industry was 23.9 percent, the average annual growth rate of light industry was 14.8 percent, and the average annual growth rate of handicrafts was 12.6 percent. At the same time, the labor productivity of state-owned industry increased by 69 percent, with an average annual growth rate of 14 percent. Of the newly added industrial output value, 72.7 percent came from the increase in labor productivity. Due to the development of industrial and agricultural production and the increase in labor productivity, China's national income [Note 1] increased by 43.8 percent, with an average annual growth rate of 9.5 percent. These figures show that while prioritizing the development of heavy industry, agriculture and light industry have also achieved corresponding development. Prioritizing the development of heavy industry while actively developing agriculture and light industry is an important feature of the Party's socialist industrialization line. The rapid development of China's industrial and agricultural production, the continuous improvement of labor productivity, and the annual increase in national income are because we have resolutely implemented the Party's socialist industrialization and socialist transformation lines.

    Second, during the same period, the portion of China's national income used for
accumulation increased by 106.5 percent, with an average annual
growth rate of 19.9 percent; the portion used for consumption
increased by 29.7 percent, with an average annual growth rate of
6.7 percent. In the accumulation portion, investment in capital construction expanded by 277.3 percent, with an average annual growth rate of 39.3 percent, of which investment in industrial capital construction expanded by 316.7 percent, with an average annual growth rate of 42.9 percent. In industrial investment, investment in heavy industry expanded by 425.5 percent, with an average annual growth rate of 51.5 percent; In the consumption portion, the workers' consumption fund increased by 48.8 percent, with an average annual growth rate of 10.5 percent, and the average real income of employees increased by 25.3 percent, with an average annual growth rate of 5.8 percent; The peasants' consumption fund increased by 28.5 percent, with an average annual growth rate of 6.5 percent, and the average real income of agricultural production per peasant household increased by 10.7 percent, with an average annual growth rate of 2.6 percent. These figures show that China's accumulation is rapidly expanding, industrial construction, especially heavy industry construction, is proceeding at a high speed, and the people's consumption level is also gradually improving. China's industrialization is closely linked to the improvement of the lives of the Chinese people. This is another important feature of the Party's socialist industrialization line. The reason why China's socialist industrialization cause has received the enthusiastic support of the people throughout the country is because this cause is not only consistent with the long-term interests of the people, but also consistent with the immediate and personal interests of the people.

Comrade Liu Shaoqi and Comrade Zhou Enlai have already made brilliant expositions on how to correctly implement the Party's line, so as to mobilize and organize the strength of the people throughout the country, mobilize all positive factors, rapidly develop production, continuously improve labor productivity, increase national income, expand the sources of accumulation, and other issues. Here, I only want to talk about my personal views on how to reasonably solve the relationship between accumulation and consumption.

    The Significance of Reasonably Solving the Relationship Between Accumulation and Consumption
Is to correctly combine the collective and long-term interests with the individual and current interests.

The significance of reasonably solving the relationship between accumulation and consumption is to correctly combine the collective and long-term interests with the individual and current interests, so that it is not only conducive to the rapid development of national economic construction, especially industrial construction, but also conducive to the gradual improvement of the people's consumption level.

People often start from the need to rapidly develop industry, especially heavy industry, for the sake of collective and long-term interests, and envision increasing the proportion of the accumulation portion. Undoubtedly, this vision is justified, because with the rapid development of heavy industry, the socialist material foundation can be quickly built, and the fundamental improvement of people's lives can have a reliable material guarantee. Therefore, during the period of socialist construction, we must do our best to accumulate the funds that can be gathered in the national economy, and first meet the needs of industrial construction, especially heavy industry construction, in appropriate proportions. However, if we only focus on the need for the rapid development of heavy industry and excessively and rapidly increase the proportion of the accumulation portion, thereby reducing the proportion of the consumption portion, so as to affect the due improvement of people's lives, that would be wrong.

China's industrialization can only exert the enthusiasm of the broad masses in building socialism, further consolidate the worker-peasant alliance on a new material basis, and enable the socialist construction cause to proceed smoothly and healthily, only when it is closely combined with the gradual improvement of the people's consumption level. Therefore, in the process of socialist industrialization, the accumulation used for industrial, agricultural and other aspects of construction can only be gradually increased with the development of social production, the improvement of labor productivity, and the increase of national income. In this way, the increase in accumulation will not affect the gradual improvement of people's lives. At the same time, due to China's relatively backward economy, large population, rapid growth, and relatively low living standards of the people, the accumulation portion cannot be increased excessively and rapidly.

Undoubtedly, in the process of industrialization, the people's consumption level should and must be gradually improved on the basis of production development and the improvement of labor productivity. Failure to do so would be a serious departure from the masses, and would constitute an unforgivable mistake. However, it is not permissible to emphasize only individual and current interests without regard to collective and long-term interests. Not only is the view that the rate of increase in consumption levels should exceed the rate of increase in production development and labor productivity wrong; but the view that the increase in consumption levels should maintain the same rate as the growth in accumulation is also wrong. Because the former will destroy the material basis on which the gradual improvement of people's consumption level depends; while the latter will delay the process of China's socialist industrialization.

It must be seen that to build our country, an economically very backward agricultural country, into an advanced socialist industrial country in a relatively short historical period, it would be difficult to complete such an arduous task without the arduous struggle, thrift and diligence, and unremitting efforts of the entire Party and the people of the country, and without accumulating every penny and every bit of material resources that can be saved and rationally using them to expand our country's socialist economic base. For the sake of China's industrialization, that is, for the sake of the collective and long-term interests of the Chinese people, the rate of increase in the consumption level of the Chinese people should not only be lower than the rate of development of social production, especially the rate of improvement in labor productivity; but should also be lower than the rate of increase in accumulation. Only in this way can we ensure the continuous increase in socialist accumulation, the continuous expansion of socialist reproduction, and the continuous enhancement of the material basis on which the improvement of the people's consumption level depends.

    Reasonably Stipulate the Proportional Relationship Between Accumulation and Consumption
The proportion of the accumulation portion in the national income should not be less than 20 percent, or slightly higher.

Therefore, according to China's specific economic conditions and the requirements of objective economic laws, it is very important to reasonably stipulate the proportional relationship between accumulation and consumption.

The changes in the proportional relationship between the accumulation portion and the consumption portion [Note 2] in China's national income in recent years, according to preliminary calculations by the State Statistical Bureau, are roughly as follows: The proportion of the accumulation portion in the national income accounted for 15.7 percent in 1952, 18.3 percent in 1953, 21.6 percent in 1954, 20.5 percent in 1955, and 22.8 percent in 1956. The proportion of the accumulation portion was lower in 1952 and 1953 because these two years were in the economic recovery period, capitalist industry and commerce had not been completely transformed, especially because of the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea. Later, the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea ended, the task of economic recovery was completed, and the socialist transformation achieved a decisive victory, production developed, and national income increased. Therefore, the proportion of the accumulation portion was correspondingly increased. This change in the proportional relationship between accumulation and consumption is basically in line with China's political and economic development and the needs of socialist industrialization. However, certain shortcomings and deviations have also occurred. According to the practice of economic construction in recent years and the situation of China's political and economic development, I think that in the next few years, it is more stable for the proportion of the accumulation portion in the national income to be no less than 20 percent, or slightly higher. In this way, we can ensure both the relatively high-speed development of China's industrial construction and the gradual improvement of the lives of the Chinese people. If we deviate too far from this level, whether it is increased or decreased, it will cause an imbalance in the development of the national economy and produce adverse effects politically.

Can such an accumulation level guarantee that China will adopt a faster speed to implement industrialization? The answer is yes. Under the conditions of China's production development and the continuous increase in national income, and under the conditions of economical use of funds, according to the experience of construction in recent years, such an accumulation level can guarantee that China will adopt a faster speed to implement industrialization, although it is not very generous. If we deviate from the conditions permitted by objective circumstances and inappropriately increase the accumulation level, it would be impossible to gradually increase the people's consumption level under the condition of ensuring the rapid development of industrial construction. It goes without saying that if the people's consumption level is not duly improved in the process of industrialization, the development of the entire national economy will be hindered, and the further consolidation of the worker-peasant alliance will be adversely affected. Turning back, it is still necessary to reduce the accumulation level and the speed of industrial construction. Otherwise, it will cause various economic and political evils. Therefore, we must adopt a prudent and steady approach to the issue of accumulation.

Will such an accumulation level affect the gradual improvement of people's lives? The answer is no. Such an accumulation level will not affect the gradual improvement of the lives of the Chinese people, which has also been confirmed by the practice of construction in China in the past few years. We know that the improvement of people's lives cannot rely solely on monetary income, but is premised on the growth of the production of means of livelihood. Under such an accumulation level, the increase in the consumption level of the Chinese people and the increase in China's consumer goods are roughly commensurate. If we reduce the accumulation level, we will lose the guarantee of funds needed for China's industrialization, delay the development of industry and the speed of socialist construction, and reduce the speed of growth in consumer goods production. This not only makes the improvement of the people's consumption level lose its guarantee, but is also detrimental to the establishment of China's independent industrial economy, the strengthening of China's national defense strength, the prevention of imperialist aggression, the defense of world peace, and the guarantee of the Chinese people's peaceful construction and peaceful life. Therefore, lowering this level is also inappropriate.

    Reasonably Stipulate the Proportion of National Budget Revenue in National Income
The proportion of national budget revenue in national income should not be less than 30 percent, or slightly higher.

Since accumulation and consumption are realized through the distribution and redistribution of national income, and the most important part of the national income used for accumulation is distributed through the national budget in our country, it is not meaningless to talk about the proportion of national budget revenue in national income here. Practice has proven that whether the proportion of accumulation and consumption is appropriate is directly related to the correctness of the proportional relationship between national income and national budget revenue, the proportional relationship between capital construction expenditure and other aspects of expenditure in the national budget expenditure, and the proportional relationship between industrial sector expenditure and other sector expenditure in capital construction expenditure. We must reasonably stipulate these proportional relationships according to the needs of industrialization and the gradual improvement of the people's consumption level in two fundamental aspects. Ignoring the needs of any aspect and inappropriately increasing or decreasing the proportion of national budget revenue in national income, the proportion of capital construction expenditure in national budget expenditure, and the proportion of investment in the industrial sector in capital construction expenditure will cause the development of contradictions between accumulation and consumption, and fail to achieve the goal of rapidly developing industry and building socialism.

The proportion of national budget revenue in national income, according to the materials of the State Statistical Bureau, has been roughly as follows in China in recent years: 27.6 percent in 1952, 29.2 percent in 1953, 32.4 percent in 1954, 31.9 percent in 1955, and 31.5 percent in 1956. The year-by-year increase in the proportion of national budget revenue in national income is related to the development of China's national economy and the expansion of the scale of construction. Such an increase is reasonable and necessary. According to this situation, I think that under the condition that there is no greater change in China's economic situation, calculated according to the current financial system, it is more stable for the proportion of national budget revenue in national income to be no less than 30 percent, or slightly higher, in the next few years.

Is this level too low, and will it delay the speed of China's socialist construction, especially industrial construction? I don't think so. The experience of the past few years has proven that whenever we want to engage in more industrial construction or other construction, and make the national budget and capital construction investment too large, we always "hasten to achieve success only to fall short," and instead create artificial tension in the development of the national economy. As a result, it is harmful to China's industrialization and the coordinated development of China's economic life. Therefore, whenever we kindly propose such or such plans to increase the burden on the people in order to engage in more construction, the Party Central Committee has always made timely and realistic corrections. It now seems that if the proportion of our national budget revenue in national income can reach the above-mentioned level, the funds needed for China's industrial construction can be guaranteed. This level is not low, but quite active.

So, is this level too high? I don't think it's too high either. Because our country is a socialist country, and China's basic industrial and mining enterprises, transportation enterprises, state-owned commerce, state banks, state-owned farms and other state-owned enterprises are all the property of the whole people rather than private property, and most of the profits of these enterprises are included in the national budget. As everyone knows, currently, about 70 percent of China's budget revenue comes from the profits, taxes and depreciation deductions turned over by state-owned enterprises, and this proportion will continue to grow year by year. In addition, after the former private industrial and commercial enterprises have undergone overall public-private partnership and implemented "fixed interest," most of their net profits, except for fixed interest and employee welfare funds, also belong to the state. Therefore, the proportion of China's national budget revenue in national income must reflect this objective reality of China's social economy, and this level is an approximate reflection of this objective reality. At the same time, China's budget is "taken from the people and used for the people." If we lower this level, then less is taken from the people, and less is used for the people. In this way, the country's economic, cultural construction and other needs will not be met, and the long-term and even current interests of the people will be damaged. Therefore, it is necessary to maintain this level under the current speed of economic development in China and under the current financial system.

    Reasonably Stipulate the Proportion of Capital Construction Expenditure in National Budget Expenditure
The proportion of capital construction expenditure in national budget expenditure should not be less than 40 percent, or slightly higher.

Correctly handling the relationship between accumulation and consumption is not enough to rely solely on reasonably stipulating the proportional relationship between national income and national budget revenue. As everyone knows, not all of the national budget revenue is used for accumulation. A considerable part of it is directly used to meet the needs of social and people's consumption, and the most important part used for accumulation is capital construction. Therefore, correctly handling the relationship between accumulation and consumption also depends on the proportional relationship between capital construction expenditure and other aspects of expenditure in the national budget. In this regard, according to the materials of the State Statistical Bureau, the situation in China in recent years is as follows: Capital construction expenditure accounted for 29.9 percent of the national final expenditure in 1952, 37.9 percent in 1953, 38.9 percent in 1954, 35.6 percent in 1955, and 46.7 percent of the national budget expenditure in 1956. It goes without saying that in order to realize socialist industrialization, the national budget expenditure must ensure the needs of capital construction investment, especially industrial construction investment, so that China's industry, especially heavy industry, can be rapidly developed, but if it exceeds the permission of objective conditions, and excessively and rapidly increases the proportion of capital construction expenditure in the national budget, it will bring adverse consequences to the development of the entire national economy, and cause a phenomenon of disconnection between accumulation and consumption. This year's capital construction investment plan is the most obvious example. This year, the investment used for capital construction in the national budget expenditure accounts for 46.7 percent, and the workload of capital construction has increased by 62 percent compared with the previous year. This is the year with the most capital construction investment in recent years, and it is also a year of rapid growth in construction work; however, what follows is that the supply of building materials and equipment cannot keep up, and the transportation capacity cannot keep up, which not only makes it difficult to smoothly implement the capital construction plan, but also causes an imbalance in the development of several aspects, bringing adverse effects to the balanced development of the national economy. According to this situation and the actual experience of recent years, I think that under the condition that there is no greater change in China's economic situation, still calculated according to the current financial system, it is more stable for the proportion of capital construction expenditure in the national budget expenditure to be no less than 40 percent, or slightly higher, in the next few years. Excessively exceeding this level, the strength of all aspects cannot be balanced, and an artificial tense situation will be created; being lower than this level will delay the construction of socialist industrialization.

While reasonably stipulating the proportional relationship between capital construction expenditure and other aspects of expenditure in the national budget expenditure, it is also necessary to reasonably stipulate the proportional relationship between industrial sector expenditure and other sector expenditure in capital construction expenditure, such as the investment proportion relationship between industry and agriculture, heavy industry and light industry, transportation, commerce, culture, education and health; as well as the proportional relationship between productive construction investment and non-productive construction investment. Otherwise, it will also cause an imbalance in the development of the national economy, and cause tension in the relationship between accumulation and consumption. In this regard, Comrade Zhou Enlai's report has made a detailed exposition, and I think they are all correct.

In the part used for accumulation by the state, in addition to capital construction investment, appropriate distribution should also be made in areas such as working capital and national reserves. It is necessary to allocate a certain amount of working capital, otherwise, it will not be possible to organize social production well and carry out capital construction smoothly. However, the turnover of working capital must be accelerated, and the proportion of working capital in accumulation must be gradually reduced in order to expand the proportion of capital construction investment as much as possible. The funds needed for national material reserves should be appropriately increased, otherwise, it will not be possible to cope with certain unexpected urgent needs and organize industrial production rhythmically. In the past few years, we have suffered a lot on this issue. Now, combining the situation of material resources and finance, taking resolute steps to truly establish a national material reserve system and ensure the completion of the material reserve plan is already the time.

As mentioned above, in the next few years, under normal circumstances, the proportion of the accumulation portion in China's national income will not be less than 20 percent, or slightly higher; the proportion of national budget revenue in China's national income will not be less than 30 percent, or slightly higher; the proportion of capital construction expenditure in China's national budget expenditure will not be less than 40 percent, or slightly higher. I personally feel that it is more in line with China's current economic situation, and it is more stable and reliable. It can not only ensure the rapid development of China's industry, especially heavy industry, but also ensure the gradual improvement of the people's consumption level, so that the lives of the Chinese people will be better year by year. However, this is only a general proportional number, and it cannot be said that it is immutable in any case. With the development of China's production, the increase in national income, the completion of socialist transformation, and the further reduction of defense expenses and administrative expenses, these proportions are not only possible but will inevitably be appropriately increased, but a certain limit must still be maintained, especially the increase in the proportion of the accumulation portion in the national income should be more cautious. At the same time, we are studying and solving the problem of the national system. If there is any change in the current financial system, the latter two proportions will also change. In addition, under certain special circumstances, such as a large harvest, a greater increase in national income, or because of serious natural disasters or other reasons, the country's economic life suffers great difficulties, we must appropriately increase or decrease these proportions according to the specific circumstances at that time.

In order to correctly handle the relationship between accumulation and consumption in the process of socialist industrialization, we must also have correct tax policies, price policies, wage policies, accumulation policies for agricultural production cooperatives and handicraft production cooperatives, as well as the policy of "streamlining troops and simplifying administration," and so on. These are not only of great importance to expanding accumulation, but also of great significance to reasonably solving the problem of consumption. I will not talk about these issues here.

In short, we must make reasonable arrangements for the above-mentioned proportional relationships according to the objective laws of China's economic development, and according to the needs of the rapid development of industry and the gradual improvement of the people's consumption level in two fundamental aspects, so that China can basically complete socialist industrialization and build a socialist material foundation in about fifteen years.

    Conduct in-depth and comprehensive analysis of the specific political and economic conditions at home and abroad, and further understand the laws of objective economic movement and its role.

It should be explained that the presentation of this proportional number is an attempt to conduct preliminary analysis of the main aspects of the relationship between accumulation and consumption based on the practice of China's national economic development in recent years, and it is of a very exploratory nature. It can at most approximately reflect the objective requirements of China's economic development process in the most recent years, as a reference for us to determine the boundaries of relevant policies. When we formulate annual plans or long-term plans for the development of the national economy, we can refer to these proportional numbers, but more important is to conduct in-depth and comprehensive analysis of the specific political and economic conditions at home and abroad at that time, and further understand the laws of objective economic movement and its role, so as to determine the correct proportional relationship. It is destined to make mistakes if you replace the study of living economic situations and economic laws with rigid proportional formulas.

According to the above analysis, it can be seen that the capital accumulation needed for China's industrialization is guaranteed, but there is also a certain limit. The speed of China's socialist construction, especially industrial construction, must be adapted to the accumulation level of China's construction funds. If the speed of industrial construction cannot keep up with this accumulation level, it will make a right-leaning conservative mistake; conversely, if it exceeds this accumulation level excessively and rapidly, it will make a "left-leaning" rash advance mistake.

The correct attitude towards the problem should be that, on the one hand, we should strive to develop production and continuously improve labor productivity in order to create material prerequisites for expanding accumulation and increasing consumption. If we forget to develop production, forget to open up financial resources, and attempt to reduce the indispensable construction investment or tighten the indispensable living expenses to solve financial difficulties, this conservative view obviously cannot solve any problems. On the other hand, we should practice strict economy, oppose waste, advocate thrift, and not engage in extravagance, in order to accumulate as much funds as possible for China's industrial construction and other necessary construction. If we think that it is already a "prosperous age," that we should meet all the needs of the people, that all the "good things" should be completed in two or three years, and that we should pay attention to pomp everywhere, then it is impossible to imagine what capital accumulation there will be, and what socialist industrialization construction there will be. We know that the people's beautiful life is created by their own labor. The people's indomitable will to strive for a beautiful life and their creative labor are the source of the continuous development of China's social production and the gradual improvement of the people's material and cultural life. Therefore, only by working hard and diligently and thriftily in production and construction, assiduously studying the advanced experiences of the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries, learning the latest scientific and technological achievements in the world, and making the most reasonable, economical and effective use of China's limited funds, can we accelerate China's socialist industrialization, gradually improve the consumption level of the Chinese people, and build China into a great socialist country in as short a historical period as possible.

Note 1: National income is the value of the total social product created by workers in industry, agriculture, construction and transportation and commerce serving production, that is, the total output value commonly referred to, minus the part used to compensate for the consumed means of production, the value of the remaining part of the social product, that is, the net output value commonly referred to.

Note 2: The part of the national income used for accumulation, in terms of the part concentrated and used by the state, includes productive and non-productive capital construction investment after deducting the part used to compensate for the depreciation of fixed assets, and increasing working capital, expanding national material reserves, etc.; in terms of state-owned enterprises, there is the accumulation part within the enterprise; in terms of cooperatives, there are public accumulation funds of agricultural production cooperatives, handicraft production cooperatives, and supply and marketing cooperatives; in terms of individual residents, there are investments from industrialists and businessmen, individual farmers and handicraftsmen, etc. These are collectively referred to as the accumulation part. The remaining part of the national income is the consumption part, which includes the wages of employees, the personal income of farmers and handicraftsmen, the income of capitalists, and the expenses used for culture, education, health, employee welfare facilities, as well as the consumption of administrative, defense and other non-production departments, etc. in the national budget and enterprise expenditure.

    正确处理积累和消费的关系
    薄一波同志的发言
    我完全同意中央委员会的政治报告、修改党章的报告、发展国民经济的第二个五年计划的报告。中央的政治报告，科学地总结了第七次全国代表大会以来党领导中国人民革命所取得的光辉成就和经验。这是马克思列宁主义基本原理和中国革命实际密切结合的胜利。从“七大”到“八大”，这一具有重大历史意义时期中，党进行了多方面的活动。党领导人民进行了艰苦的斗争，终于击败了国内外强大的敌人，彻底地完成了伟大的民主革命，和基本上实现了伟大的社会主义革命。党正在领导人民进行艰巨的社会主义建设和社会主义改造，发展国民经济的第一个五年计划正在提前完成和超额完成。
    我国社会主义工业化过程中的一个头等重要的问题
    第一个五年计划的执行情况说明，党所制定的我国社会主义工业化的路线是完全正确的，只要我们坚决地贯彻党的路线，就完全有可能在大约十五年左右的时间，基本上完成我国的社会主义工业化，将我国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义国家。但是，要完成这样艰巨的任务，就必须要有和它相适应的资金积累，而实现积累的道路，由于我国社会制度本质所决定，则只能依靠国内积累。这样，积累的多少和快慢，就不仅直接地影响到社会主义工业化的速度，而且也直接地影响到人民的消费水平和生活改善的程度。所以正确地解决积累和消费的关系，是我国社会主义工业化过程中一个头等重要的问题。
    在过去几年间，我们对积累和消费关系的处理，基本上是正确的，但也发生过某些偏差。实践证明，当我们对积累和消费的关系处理得比较妥善的时候，国家的经济生活就表现出协调的现象，就对于工业和其它经济部门的发展，人民生活的改善，产生有利的影响。反之，当我们对积累和消费的关系处理得不够妥善的时候，我国的经济生活就显得不正常，工业的发展，其它经济部门的发展，人民生活的改善，就受到不利的影响。
    因此，党根据苏联和社会主义各国的经验，特别是根据我国建设的实践，要求我们在进行我国的社会主义工业化的时候，一方面，必须采取较高的速度优先发展重工业，另一方面，又必须积极地发展农业和轻工业；一方面，要厉行节约，以积累更多的建设资金，另一方面，又要相应地提高消费水平，使人民的生活逐步地得到改善。这样做是否有可能呢？是有可能的。过去几年我国经济建设的实践，就是很好的证明。
    第一，从一九五三——一九五六年四年中
  （以一九五二年为一百），我国的工业生产提高了百分之一百零四，平均每年增长的速度是百分之十九点五；我国的农业生产提高了百分之十九，平均每年增长的速度是百分之四点四。在工业生产中，重工业平均每年增长的速度是百分之二十三点九，轻工业平均每年增长的速度是百分之十四点八，手工业平均每年增长的速度是百分之十二点六。与此同时，国营工业的劳动生产率提高了百分之六十九，平均每年增长的速度是百分之十四，在新增的工业产值中，有百分之七十二点七是依靠劳动生产率的提高而来的。由于工农业生产的发展和劳动生产率的提高，我国的国民收入〔注一〕增长了百分之四十三点八，平均每年增长的速度是百分之九点五。这些数字说明，我们在优先发展重工业的同时，农业和轻工业也获得了相应的发展。优先发展重工业，同时积极发展农业和轻工业，这是党的社会主义工业化路线的重要特征。我国工农业生产的迅速发展，劳动生产率的不断提高，国民收入的逐年增长，就是因为我们坚决地贯彻了党的社会主义工业化和社会主义改造的路线。
      第二，在同一时期，我国的国民收入中用于
  积累的部分增加了百分之一百零六点五，平均每
  年增长的速度是百分之十九点九；用于消费的部
  分增加了百分之二十九点七，平均每年增长的速度是百分之六点七。在积累部分中，基本建设的投资扩大了百分之二百七十七点三，平均每年增长的速度是百分之三十九点三，其中工业基本建设的投资扩大了百分之三百一十六点七，平均每年增长的速度是百分之四十二点九，在工业投资中重工业的投资扩大了百分之四百二十五点五，平均每年增长的速度是百分之五十一点五；在消费部分中工人的消费基金增加了百分之四十八点八，平均每年增长的速度是百分之十点五，职工的平均实际收入增加了百分之二十五点三，平均每年增长的速度是百分之五点八；农民的消费基金增加了百分之二十八点五，平均每年增长的速度是百分之六点五，每户农民的农业生产的平均实际收入增加了百分之十点七，平均每年增长的速度是百分之二点六。这些数字说明，我国的积累在迅速扩大，工业特别是重工业建设在高速度地进行，人民的消费水平也在逐步地提高。我国的工业化和我国人民生活的改善是密切结合着的，这是党的社会主义工业化路线的另一个重要特征。我国社会主义工业化事业之所以得到了全国人民的热烈拥护，就是因为这一事业不仅同人民群众的长远利益是一致的，而且同人民群众的当前的切身的利益也是一致的。
    关于如何正确地贯彻党的路线，以便动员和组织全国人民的力量，调动一切积极因素，迅速发展生产，不断提高劳动生产率，增加国民收入，扩大积累的源泉等等问题，在刘少奇同志和周恩来同志的报告中，已经作了精湛的论述。这里我只想就如何合理解决积累和消费的关系问题，说一说个人的看法。
    合理地解决积累和消费关系的意义
    就是要将集体的、长远的利益和个人的、当前的利益正确地结合起来。
    合理地解决积累和消费关系的意义，就是要将集体的、长远的利益和个人的、当前的利益正确地结合起来，使之既有利于国家经济建设、特别是工业建设的迅速发展，又有利于人民消费水平的逐步提高。
    人们为了集体的、长远的利益，常常从迅速发展工业特别是重工业的需要出发，设想提高积累部分的比重。无疑的，这种设想是有理由的，因为有了重工业的迅速发展，社会主义物质基础才能很快地建成，人民生活的根本改善才有可靠的物质保证。所以，在社会主义建设时期，必须尽力把国民经济中可能聚集的资金，都积累起来，并按照恰当的比例，首先满足工业特别是重工业建设的需要。但是，如果只顾重工业迅速发展的需要，过多地和过快地提高积累部分的比重，缩小消费部分的比重，以致影响人民生活的应有的改善，那就是错误的了。
    我国工业化，只有和人民消费水平的逐步提高密切结合起来，才能发挥广大群众建设社会主义的积极性，才能在新的物质基础上进一步巩固工农联盟，才能使社会主义建设事业顺利地健康地进行。因此，在社会主义工业化过程中，用来进行工农业及其它方面建设的积累，只能随着社会生产的发展、劳动生产率的提高、和国民收入的增大而逐步地增加。这样，才不会因积累增加，影响到人民生活的逐步改善。同时，由于我国经济比较落后，人口众多，增殖较快，人民生活水平还较低，因而积累部分也不可能过多地和过快地增加。
    无疑地，在工业化过程中，人民的消费水平，是应当而且必需在生产发展和劳动生产率提高的基础上逐步提高的，不这样做，那就是严重的脱离群众，那就会犯不可饶恕的错误。但是，如果只片面地强调个人的、当前的利益，而不顾集体的、长远的利益，则是不能容许的。不但那种想把消费水平提高的速度，超过生产发展和劳动生产率提高的速度的观点，是错误的；而且要求消费水平的提高同积累的增长保持相等的速度的观点，同样也是错误的。因为前者将使人民消费水平逐步提高所依靠的物质基础遭到破坏；而后者则将延缓我国社会主义工业化的进程。
    必须看到，要在比较短的历史时期内，将我们这样一个在经济上非常落后的农业国，建设成为一个先进的社会主义工业国，如果没有全党和全国人民艰苦奋斗，克勤克俭，坚持不懈的努力，如果不把可能节省下来的每一文钱和每一分物质资源都积累起来，合理地使用到扩大我国社会主义经济基础上去，这样艰巨的任务，是很难完成的。为了我国的工业化，也就是说，为了我国人民集体的、长远的利益，我国人民消费水平提高的速度，不仅应当低于社会生产发展特别是劳动生产率提高的速度；而且应当低于积累的增长的速度。只有这样，才能保证社会主义的积累不断地增加，社会主义再生产不断地扩大，人民消费水平提高所依靠的物质基础不断地增强。
    合理地规定积累和消费的比例关系
    国民收入中积累部分的比重，应不低于百分之二十，或者略高一点。
    所以，按照我国具体的经济条件和经济客观规律的要求，合理地规定积累和消费的比例关系，是很重要的。
    几年来，我国国民收入中积累部分和消费部分〔注二〕比例关系的变化，根据国家统计局初步的计算，大体是这样的：积累部分在国民收入中的比重，一九五二年占百分之十五点七，一九五三年占百分之十八点三，一九五四年占百分之二十一点六，一九五五年占百分之二十点五，一九五六年占百分之二十二点八。积累部分的比重，在一九五二年和一九五三年较低，是由于这两年处在经济恢复时期，资本主义工商业尚未完全改造，特别是有抗美援朝战争。以后抗美援朝战争结束，恢复经济任务完成，社会主义改造取得了决定性的胜利，生产发展，国民收入增加，因而，积累部分的比重，也就相应地有所提高。积累和消费比例关系的这种变化，基本上是合乎我国政治经济发展的情况和社会主义工业化的需要的。但是也发生过某些缺点和偏差。根据几年来经济建设的实践和我国政治经济发展的情况，我觉得在今后若干年内，积累部分在国民收入中的比重，以不低于百分之二十，或者略高一点，是比较稳妥的。这样，既可以保证我国工业建设较高速度的发展，又可以保证我国人民生活的逐步改善。如果脱离这个水平太远，不论是增高或降低，都会造成国民经济发展的失调，并在政治上产生不良的影响。
    这样的积累水平，能不能保证我国采取较快的速度实行工业化呢？回答是肯定的。在我国生产发展和国民收入不断增加的条件下，在节约地使用资金的条件下，根据几年来建设的经验，这样的积累水平是可以保证我国采取较快的速度实行工业化的，虽然并不很宽裕。如果我们脱离客观情况所许可的条件，不适当地提高积累水平，那就不可能在保证工业建设迅速发展的条件下，逐步地提高人民的消费水平。不言而喻，如果人民的消费水平在工业化过程中得不到应有的提高，整个国民经济的发展就要受到阻滞，工农联盟的进一步巩固也将受到不利的影响。回过头来，还是要降低积累水平和工业建设的速度的。否则，就会在经济上和政治上造成种种恶果。因此，在积累问题上，必须采取慎重稳妥的方针。
    这样的积累水平会不会影响人民生活的逐步改善呢？回答是否定的。这样的积累水平是不会影响我国人民生活的逐步改善的，这同样为我国过去几年建设的实践所证实。我们知道，人民生活的改善，不能只靠货币收入，而是以生活资料生产的增长为前提的。在这样的积累水平条件下，我国人民消费水平的提高和我国消费资料的增长，大体是相适应的。如果降低积累水平，就会使我国工业化所需要的资金失去保证，就会延缓工业的发展和社会主义建设的速度，并降低消费资料生产增长的速度。这不仅使人民消费水平的提高失去保证，而且对于建立我国独立的工业经济，加强我国的国防实力，防止帝国主义的侵略，保卫世界和平，保障我国人民的和平建设和和平生活，也是不利的。因之，降低这个水平，同样是不妥当的。
    合理地规定国家预算收入在国民收入中的比重
    国家预算收入在国民收入中的比重，应不低于百分之三十，或者略高一点。
    由于积累和消费是经过国民收入的分配和再分配来实现的，国民收入中用于积累方面的最主要的部分在我国又是通过国家预算来进行分配，因之，在这里讲一讲国家预算收入在国民收入中的比重，不是没有意义的。实践证明，积累和消费的比例是否恰当，同国民收入和国家预算收入的比例关系、国家预算支出中基本建设支出和其它方面支出的比例关系、基本建设支出中工业部门支出和其它部门支出的比例关系的正确与否，有直接的联系。必须根据工业化和逐步提高人民消费水平两个根本方面的需要，合理地规定这几个方面的比例关系。忽视任何一个方面的需要，不适当地提高或降低国民收入中国家预算收入的比重、国家预算支出中基本建设支出的比重、基本建设支出中工业部门投资的比重，都会引起积累和消费之间矛盾的发展，而达不到迅速发展工业和建成社会主义的目的。
    国家预算收入在国民收入中的比重，根据国家统计局的材料，我国几年来的情况大略是这样的：一九五二年占百分之二十七点六，一九五三年占百分之二十九点二，一九五四年占百分之三十二点四，一九五五年占百分之三十一点九，一九五六年占百分之三十一点五。国家预算收入在国民收入中比重的逐年提高，是同我国国民经济的发展和建设规模的扩大相联系的。这样的提高，是合理的，也是必要的。根据这种情况，我觉得在我国的经济情况没有更大变化的条件下，按现行的财政体制计算，国家预算收入在国民收入中的比重，在今后若干年内，不要低于百分之三十，或者略高一点，是比较稳妥的。
    这个水平是否低了，它会不会延缓我国社会主义建设特别是工业建设的速度呢？我看是不会的。过去几年的经验证明，每当我们想更多地搞一些工业建设或其它建设，而将国家预算和基本建设的投资打得过大的时候，总是“欲速则不达”，反而造成国民经济发展的人为紧张。结果对于我国的工业化和我国经济生活的协调地发展，都是有害的。所以每当我们善心好意地为了多搞一些建设，而提出这样或那样的增加人民负担的方案的时候，党中央都及时地实事求是地作了纠正。现在看来，我们的国家预算收入在国民收入中的比重，如果能够达到上述水平，我国的工业建设所需要的资金就可以得到必要的保证。这个水平不是较低的，而是相当积极的。
    那么，这个水平是不是太高了呢？我看也不太高。由于我们的国家是社会主义性质的国家，我国的基本工矿企业、交通运输企业、国营商业、国家银行、国营农场和其它国营企业，都是属于全民的而不是私人的财产，这些企业的盈利，绝大部分要列入国家预算。众所周知，目前我国的预算收入中，约有百分之七十是来自国营企业的上缴利润、税金和折旧提成的，而且这一比例还将逐年增长。此外，过去的私人工商企业，经过全行业公私合营和实行“定息”之后，其纯利除定息和职工福利基金以外的大部分，也属于国家所有。因此，我国的国家预算收入在国民收入中所占的比重，必须反映出我国社会经济的这种客观实际，而这个水平，就是这种客观实际的一种近似的反映。同时，我国的预算是“取之于民，用之于民”的，如果降低这个水平，那么，取之于民的少了，用之于民的也就少了。这样，国家的经济、文化建设和其它方面的需要，将不能得到满足，而人民长远的以至当前的利益，也会受到损害。所以在我国目前经济发展的速度之下，在现行的财政体制之下，保持这个水平是必要的。
    合理地规定国家预算支出中基本建设支出的比重
    国家预算支出中基本建设支出的比重，应不低于百分之四十，或者略高一点。
    正确地处理积累和消费的关系，仅仅依靠合理规定国民收入和国家预算收入的比例关系，仍然是不够的。大家知道，国家预算收入并不是全部都用于积累的。其中有相当部分是直接用于满足社会和人民消费的需要，而用于积累方面的，最主要的部分则是基本建设。因此，正确地处理积累和消费的关系，还取决于国家预算中基本建设支出和其它方面支出的比例关系。在这方面，根据国家统计局的材料，我国几年来的情况是这样的：一九五二年基本建设支出占国家决算支出的百分之二十九点九，一九五三年占百分之三十七点九，一九五四年占百分之三十八点九，一九五五年占百分之三十五点六，一九五六年占国家预算支出的百分之四十六点七。不言而喻，为了实现社会主义工业化，国家预算支出必须保证基本建设投资的需要，特别是工业建设投资的需要，使我国工业特别是重工业能够得到迅速的发展，但是如果超过了客观条件的许可，过多地和过快地提高国家预算中基本建设支出的比重，就会给整个国民经济的发展带来不良的后果，并且使积累和消费之间发生脱节的现象。今年的基本建设投资计划，就是最明显的例子。今年国家预算支出中用于基本建设的投资占百分之四十六点七，基本建设的工作量比上一年度增长百分之六十二。这是几年来基本建设投资最多的一年，也是建设工作突飞猛进地增长的一年；但是随之而来的是建筑材料和设备的供应跟不上，运输力量跟不上，不仅基本建设计划难以顺利地执行，而且还造成若干方面发展的失调，给国民经济的平衡发展带来了不利的影响。根据这种情况和几年来的实际经验，我觉得在我国的经济情况没有更大变化的条件下，仍按现行财政体制计算，国家预算支出中基本建设支出的比重，在今后若干年内，以不低于百分之四十，或者略高一点，是比较稳妥的。过多的高出这个水平，各方面的力量就不能取得平衡，并会造成人为的紧张局面；低于这个水平，就会延缓社会主义工业化的建设。
    在合理规定国家预算支出中基本建设支出和其它方面支出的比例关系的同时，还必须合理地规定基本建设支出中工业部门支出和其它部门支出的比例关系，如工业和农业、重工业和轻工业、交通运输业、商业、文教卫生等方面的投资比例关系；以及生产性建设投资和非生产性建设投资的比例关系。否则，同样会引起国民经济发展的比例失调，引起积累和消费之间的关系的紧张。在这方面，周恩来同志的报告中已经做了详细的论述，我认为都是正确的。
    在国家用于积累的部分中，除了基本建设投资以外，在流动资金和国家储备等方面，也应作适当的分配。拨出一定数量的流动资金是必需的，否则，就不可能很好地组织社会的生产和顺利地进行基本建设。但是，流动资金的周转必须加速，流动资金在积累中所占的比重，必须逐步地降低，以便尽可能地扩大基本建设投资的比重。国家物资储备所需要的资金，应适当地增加，否则，就不可能应付某些意外的急需，和有节奏地组织工业生产。几年来，我们在这个问题上吃了不少的苦头。现在，结合物质资源和财政的状况，采取坚决的步骤，真正建立国家的物资储备制度和保证完成物资储备计划，已经是时候了。
    如上所述，在今后若干年内，在通常的情况之下，我国国民收入中积累部分的比重，不低于百分之二十，或者略高一点；我国国民收入中国家预算收入的比重，不低于百分之三十，或者略高一点；我国国家预算支出中基本建设支出的比重，不低于百分之四十，或者略高一点，我个人觉得是比较符合我国当前的经济状况的，是比较稳妥可靠的，它既可以保证我国的工业特别是重工业的迅速发展，又可以保证人民消费水平的逐步提高，使我国人民的生活一年比一年过得好些。但是，这只是一个概略的比例数字，决不能说在任何情况下，都是一成不变的。随着我国生产的发展，国民收入的增加，社会主义改造的完成，国防费用和行政费用的进一步节减，这些比例不仅可能而且必将适当地提高，但是，仍须保持一定的限度，特别是国民收入中积累部分比重的提高，应该更加慎重。同时，我们正在研究和解决国家的体制问题，如果现行的财政体制有所改变的时候，后两个比例也将有所改变。此外，在某些特殊情况之下，如大的丰收，国民收入有较大的增长，或者由于严重的自然灾害或其它原因，国家的经济生活遭到极大困难的时候，我们就必须根据当时的具体情况，适当地提高或降低这些比例。
    为了正确地处理社会主义工业化过程中的积累和消费的关系，还必须要有正确的税收政策，价格政策，工资政策，农业生产合作社和手工业生产合作社的积累政策，以及“精兵简政”的政策等等。这些，不仅对于扩大积累有很大的重要性，而且对于合理地解决消费问题也有很大的意义。关于这些问题，我不在这里说了。
    总之，必须根据我国经济发展的客观规律，按照工业的迅速发展和人民消费水平的逐步提高这两个根本方面的需要，对上述各个方面的比例关系作合理地安排，以便使我国能够在大约十五年左右的时间，基本上完成社会主义工业化，建成社会主义的物质基础。
    深入全面地分析国内外政治经济的具体条件，进一步认识客观经济运动过程的规律及其作用。
    应该说明，这种比例数字的提出，是根据我国近几年来国民经济发展的实践，对于积累和消费关系的几个主要方面，进行初步分析的一种尝试，带有很大的探讨性质，它至多只能近似地反映在最近若干年内我国经济发展过程的客观要求，作为我们确定有关政策界限时的一种参考。在我们制订发展国民经济的年度计划或长期计划的时候，可以参考这些比例数字，但是，更重要的则是深入地全面地分析当时国内外的政治经济的具体条件，进一步认识客观经济运动过程的规律及其作用，从而确定正确的比例关系。如果以死板的比例公式代替活的经济情况和经济规律的研究，那是注定要犯错误的。
    根据上面的分析，可以看到，我国工业化所需要的资金积累是有保证的，但是又有一定的限度。我国社会主义建设，特别是工业建设的速度，必须同我国建设资金的积累水平相适应。如果工业建设的速度跟不上这个积累水平，那就会犯右倾保守的错误；相反的，如果过多地和过快地超过了这个积累水平，那就会犯“左”倾冒进的错误。
    正确对待问题的态度，应当是，一方面努力发展生产，不断提高劳动生产率，以便为扩大积累、提高消费创造物质前提。如果忘记发展生产，忘记开辟财源，而企图削减必不可少的建设投资或紧缩必不可少的生活费用，去解决财政困难，这种保守观点，显然是不能解决任何问题的。另一方面，应当厉行节约，反对浪费，崇尚俭朴，不务奢华，以便聚集尽可能多的资金，来进行我国的工业建设和其它必要的建设。如果以为现在已经是“太平盛世”，应该满足人们的一切需要，应该将所有的“好事”都在两三年内做完，应该到处都讲究排场，这样，就不可能设想还有什么资金积累，还有什么社会主义工业化的建设。我们知道，人民群众的美好生活，是由他们自己的劳动来创造的。人民群众为争取美好生活不屈不挠的意志和他们创造性的劳动，才是我国社会生产不断发展，人民物质生活和文化生活逐步提高的源泉。所以，只有艰苦奋斗、克勤克俭地进行生产和建设，孜孜不倦地学习苏联和其它兄弟国家的先进经验，学习世界上最新的科学技术成就，将我国有限的资金加以最合理、最节省、最有效地利用，才能加速我国的社会主义工业化，和逐步地提高我国人民的消费水平，才能在尽可能短的历史时期内将我国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义国家。
    注一：国民收入是由工业、农业、建筑业和服务于生产的运输业、商业工作者所创造的社会总产品的价值，也就是常说的总产值，除去用来补偿已消耗的生产资料的那一部分，剩下的另一部分社会产品的价值，也就是常说的净产值。
    注二：国民收入中用于积累方面的，从国家集中使用的部分来说，有扣除了补偿固定资产折旧部分的生产性的和非生产性的基本建设投资，和增加流动资金，扩大国家物资储备等；从国营企业来说，有企业内部的积累部分；从合作社来说，有农业生产合作社、手工业生产合作社、供销合作社的公积金；从居民个人来说，有工商业者、个体农民和手工业者的投资等等。这些总称为积累部分。国民收入中的其余部分，即为消费部分，其中包括了职工的工资，农民、手工业者的个人收入，资本家的收入，和国家预算和企业支出中用于文化、教育、保健、职工福利设施的费用，以及行政、国防及其它非生产部门的消费等等。
