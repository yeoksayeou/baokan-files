    The Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang held a symposium to welcome the Eighth National Congress of the CPC. At the symposium, everyone unanimously agreed that the Eighth National Congress of the CPC is a major event in the political life of the people of the whole country, with far-reaching historical and international significance. The symposium decided that the organizations of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang from the central to the local levels should conduct in-depth discussions and study of the documents of the Congress.

    The Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League held its fourth meeting on the 14th and passed the "Decision on Welcoming the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China." The decision stated: "The convocation of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China is an event of great historical significance in our country. The Communist Party of China is the core force leading our cause and the organizer and leader of the Chinese People's Democratic United Front. Under the principle of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision, our League and the people of the whole country will unite more closely around the Communist Party of China and work hard for the great cause of socialist construction and socialist transformation." The decision called on the entire League to express sincere congratulations to the Eighth National Congress of the CPC with practical actions. Comrades of the League and intellectuals associated with the League should work even harder, unleash their potential, raise their awareness, strengthen unity, connect with the masses, and do a better job in their posts, especially in participating in cultural and educational construction, cultivating new forces, advancing towards science, and serving the great socialist cause. In the near future, all comrades of the League should study the documents of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China to improve their ideological understanding and bring into play their socialist labor enthusiasm and creativity.

    The Central Committee of the China Peasants and Workers Democratic Party decided to organize central committee members and department-level leading cadres in Beijing to study the documents of the Congress and organize symposiums for discussion. The political theory study of cadres of the Central Committee and the Beijing Municipal Committee of the China Peasants and Workers Democratic Party will be suspended to focus on studying the "Eighth National Congress" documents. It was also decided to notify local party organizations throughout the country to attach importance to the documents of the Congress and conscientiously organize study and discussion.

    In order to welcome the convocation of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the China Association for Promoting Democracy held a meeting of the Standing Committee of the Central Committee on the 14th and made a resolution. The resolution called on all members to celebrate the convocation of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China with practical actions of enhancing their awareness and contributing all their strength to serve socialism. The resolution stated that the organizations of the Association at all levels must strengthen their work, vigorously implement the principle of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision put forward by the Party, closely connect with the masses, unite more closely around the Party, and strive for the construction of socialism. The resolution also called on all members to study the documents of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China in a timely and serious manner to deepen their political understanding and improve their ideological level. The Standing Committee of the Central Committee will hold several symposiums during the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China to study and discuss the documents of the Congress.
