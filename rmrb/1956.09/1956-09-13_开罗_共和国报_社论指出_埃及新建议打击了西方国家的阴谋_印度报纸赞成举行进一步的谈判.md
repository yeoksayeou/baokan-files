Xinhua News Agency, September 12th dispatch from Cairo: The Egyptian "Republic" stated on September 11th that Egypt's proposal to convene a conference to revise the Constantinople Convention on freedom of navigation in the Suez Canal "is a blow to the attempt to restrict the Suez Canal issue." It has already placed the Prime Ministers of Britain and France in a very embarrassing situation.

The newspaper pointed out, "What they have not frankly stated is that they do not need a peaceful solution, but need to wage war against Egypt."

"Republic" said that Egypt does not intend to adopt a passive attitude. It has decided to proactively request a conference to be convened, at which various viewpoints on the Suez Canal can be studied in order to reach a peaceful solution.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, September 11th: The "Times of India" reported today that President Nasser's recent proposal to hold further negotiations to resolve the Suez crisis has been welcomed in New Delhi. The newspaper said that diplomatic circles in New Delhi believe that India may be invited to participate in the proposed negotiating body.

The "Hindustan Times" believes that the failure of the Menzies mission was inevitable. The newspaper said: "Only the proposal put forward by India to establish an international advisory committee to assist Egypt in managing the canal can best achieve a satisfactory solution for everyone."

    开罗“共和国报”社论指出
    埃及新建议打击了西方国家的阴谋
    印度报纸赞成举行进一步的谈判
    据新华社12日讯　开罗消息：埃及“共和国报”9月11日说，埃及提出召开一次会议来重订关于苏彝士运河航行自由的君士坦丁堡公约的建议“对企图限制苏彝士运河事件是一个打击”。它已经给英国和法国的首相和总理造成了很窘的局面。
    这家报纸指出，“他们所没有坦白说出的是：他们不需要和平解决，而需要对埃及作战”。
     “共和国报”说，埃及没有打算采取消极的态度。它已经决定主动要求召开一次会议，在这个会上关于苏彝士运河的各种观点都可以研究以便得到和平解决”。
    据新华社新德里11日电“印度时报”今天报道说，纳赛尔总统最近提出的举行进一步的谈判来解决苏彝士危机问题的建议，在新德里受到了欢迎。这家报纸说，新德里的外交界人士认为，印度可能被邀请参加建议中的谈判机构。
     “印度斯坦时报”认为孟席斯代表团的失败是必然的。这家报纸说：“只有根据印度所提出的规定成立国际谘询委员会来协助埃及管理运河的建议，才能最好地求得令大家都满意的解决办法。”
