Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai. The Shanghai branch of the Chinese Nursing Association and the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau recently held a series of symposiums to discuss nursing work issues.

At the meetings, nurses reflected on the current chaotic organization and leadership of nursing work, unclear responsibilities, and the frustrations in their work and studies.

Some people reflected that many experienced nurses in Shanghai have long been detached from nursing work and transferred to offices to do clerical work and answer telephones. Many people also mistakenly believe that nurses only make beds and handle bedpans. Few people care about nurses' living conditions and benefits. Some hospitals even canceled nurses' dormitories in order to expand wards. In some hospitals, night shift and day shift nurses live in the same room, and nurses do not get enough sleep, which seriously affects their health. According to a health survey report of nurses from twenty-seven hospitals and clinics received by the Shanghai branch of the Chinese Nursing Association, the absenteeism rate of nurses in various units has increased in the past year, and in individual hospitals, half of the nurses are working while ill. Forty-six nurses in eight hospitals have had miscarriages or premature births in the past year.

Nurses also raised opinions on the current nursing education system, believing that limiting nurses to the level of intermediate technicians makes nurses feel that they have no future, which affects their work enthusiasm. Some nurses have given up their profession and gone to universities to switch to agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry. General young students are also unwilling to apply to nursing schools.

After this discussion, the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau and the Shanghai branch of the Chinese Nursing Association have submitted suggestions to the Ministry of Health to open advanced nursing schools. The Health Bureau has conducted research on nurses' living conditions and staffing, will try its best to improve them, and has asked the Nursing Association to assist in compiling a unified nursing work routine.

    关心护士的生活和学习
    上海着手改进护士工作
    新华社上海讯　中华护士学会上海分会和上海市卫生局最近为讨论护士工作问题举行了一连串的座谈会。
    护士们在会上反映了目前护士工作的组织领导混乱、职责范围不清，以及工作、学习中的苦闷。
    有些人反映，上海不少有经验的护士长期脱离护理工作，被调到办公室去抄抄写写、接电话。许多人也错误地认为，护士只是铺床、拿便盆的。很少有人关心护士的生活待遇。有的医院为了扩充病房，竟取消了护士的宿舍。有的医院夜班和白班护士住在一个房间，护士得不到充分睡眠，身体健康受到了严重影响。据中华护士学会上海分会收到的二十七个医院、诊所护士健康调查报告，最近一年中，各单位的护士缺勤率增加了，个别医院有半数护士带病工作。八个医院在这一年中曾经有四十六个护士流产、早产。
    护士们对目前的护士教育制度也提出了意见，认为把护士一律局限在中级技术人员这一级，使护士感觉没有前途，影响了她们的工作热情。有的护士已经放弃自己的专业，到大学去改读农林、畜牧。一般青年学生也都不愿报考护士学校。
    上海市卫生局和中华护士学会上海分会经过这次讨论，已向卫生部提出开办高级的护士学校等建议。卫生局对护士生活、人员编制已经进行研究，将尽力改进，并请护士学会协助编制一个统一的护士工作常规。
