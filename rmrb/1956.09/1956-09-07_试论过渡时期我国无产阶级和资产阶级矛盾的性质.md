    On the Nature of the Contradiction Between the Proletariat and the Bourgeoisie in China During the Transition Period
    Gu Ming, Tian Fang
    The work of socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce under the leadership of the Party and the government for the past seven years has now achieved a decisive victory. From now on, China's most intense and largest-scale class struggle has passed, and the evolution of the contradiction and struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie (specifically referring to the national bourgeoisie, the same below) has shown its basic laws and the inevitable trend of development. It is of great significance to study these laws in a timely manner, especially to clarify the nature of the contradiction between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in China today. Because this is an important practical and theoretical issue in China today, it is a problem of combining and specifically applying Marxist-Leninist class struggle theory with China's revolutionary practice.
    China's transition period allows the existence of capitalism, and the relationship of exploitation and being exploited still exists between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. The general nature of this contradiction, which is based on irreconcilable class interests, cannot but be antagonistic. The antagonistic nature of this contradiction determines that after the victory of the New Democratic Revolution in the first stage of China's revolution, it is necessary to carry out the socialist revolution in the second stage. The purpose of this revolution is to begin to resolve the antagonistic contradiction between China's proletariat and bourgeoisie. Although there is an antagonistic contradiction between these two classes in China's transition period, the nature of this contradiction cannot be generalized. The situation of class struggle in China's transition period is fundamentally different from what happens in capitalist countries. The contradiction between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie was one thing in the rising era of capitalism, but it is another thing in the socialist era when the proletarian dictatorship has achieved a great victory in the scope of 900 million people. As for the current conditions in China, it is even another matter. The change in the situation of class struggle is determined by the comparison of class forces. If the comparison of class forces changes, the degree of antagonism of the antagonistic contradiction and even the nature of the contradiction itself will certainly not remain unchanged forever. The reason why China can adopt the policy of persuasion and education and peaceful transformation of capitalists in a non-antagonistic form during the transition period is because the comparison of class forces has undergone fundamental changes, and the antagonistic contradiction between the two classes will inevitably produce its special nature. This is because the special historical, political, economic, and social conditions in China have determined that this antagonistic contradiction may be transformed into a non-antagonistic contradiction without going through an explosive revolution. The special conditions formed by the long-term revolutionary history of China include:
  (1) The leadership of the Communist Party; (2) The proletariat has grasped the powerful state apparatus, and the nature of the people's democratic dictatorship has actually become the proletarian dictatorship; (3) The unbreakable worker-peasant alliance, which firmly unites the working class and the peasant class, which account for 80-90% of China's population; (4) The socialist economic base is growing stronger and stronger and has become a strong leading force in the entire national economy; (5) The proletariat has laid a leading position on the cultural and ideological front; (6) The dual nature of the bourgeoisie, and after our party's long-term and patient efforts to win over and educate, most of the bourgeoisie have been attracted to the ranks of the people's revolution. (7) The people's democratic united front has played its role in the past, and will continue to play its great role in the future; (8) The victory of the Chinese revolution is in a favorable international situation where socialism has become a world system. To correctly understand the nature and special nature of the contradiction between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in China's transition period, we must first clarify these special conditions in China's historical development.
    Since the founding of the country, through a series of victories such as the movement to resist the United States and aid Korea, the land reform movement, the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the implementation of the policy of unified purchase and sale, especially the high tide of the agricultural cooperative movement, the long-term ties of the bourgeoisie with imperialism, feudalism, and rural capitalism (rich peasant economy) in politics, economy, and ideology have been basically severed. With the consolidation of the people's democratic dictatorship, the socialist economy is growing, the socialist transformation is gradually deepening, the scope of state capitalism is expanding and gradually transitioning to nationalization, private capitalism is gradually shrinking and even disappearing, and the united front work continues to play its role. The bourgeoisie gradually recognizes the inevitable laws of historical development and is determined to grasp its own destiny. Therefore, it is entirely possible and is gradually being realized to be forced by the general trend and voluntarily abandon exploitation and strive to become self-reliant laborers. Therefore, the above-mentioned development trend of the contradiction and struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in China's transition period is also the process of gradual transformation of the nature of the contradiction in the struggle, that is, the process of gradually weakening the antagonism and gradually increasing the non-antagonism.
    A basic law is shown from the development process of the contradiction and struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in China: the various forms of struggle to overcome contradictions are determined by the nature of the contradictions, and what kind of contradictions are overcome by what kind of struggle forms. However, this is not absolute. According to the specific development of things, under certain conditions, not only can the forms of struggle change, but the nature of the contradictions will also change. The nature of the contradiction cannot be overcome or changed without a certain form of struggle. The form of struggle exists only to overcome or change the nature of the contradiction. People correctly grasp the form of struggle can affect or even change the nature of the contradiction, but in the end, it is still determined by the nature of the contradiction to correctly overcome the contradiction of a certain nature. The change and development of the contradiction and struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in China's transition period is gradually advancing according to this law.
    The antagonistic contradiction between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in China's transition period once erupted into an antagonistic struggle. This is the "five poisons" attack launched by the bourgeoisie and the "three-anti" and "five-anti" movements carried out by the working class and the people of the whole country under the leadership of the Party and the government. The "three-anti" and "five-anti" repelled the bourgeoisie's rampant attack. After this fierce struggle, the bourgeoisie recognized the leadership of the proletariat in fact, thereby weakening the degree of antagonism of the antagonistic contradiction between the two classes to a certain extent.
    The proposal of the general line and the formulation of the Constitution are two great happy events after the victory of the Chinese people. According to many historical characteristics of China's transition period and the inevitable laws of historical development, it stipulates the specific road and specific methods for China's socialist transformation and socialist construction. Its fundamental purpose is to transform the different ownership systems of China's multiple economic components into a single socialist ownership system and eliminate exploitation and poverty. According to the provisions of the Constitution, the specific steps for the state to carry out socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce are divided into two steps, namely, the first step is to transform capitalism into various forms of state capitalism, and the second step is to transform state capitalism into socialism.
    The policy of adopting the transitional form of state capitalism to carry out socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce is a special form of class struggle in China. China's socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce has achieved great results in the past six years, but if it only stays in the intermediate form of most state capitalism and the advanced form of some individual enterprises' joint state-private ownership, it cannot meet the requirements of the development of the entire socialist cause. That is to say, if the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce only stays in the first step, and does not advance to the second step, and does not transform the economy of state capitalism into a socialist economy, it is impossible to fundamentally overcome the antagonistic contradiction between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. We can find that after the realization of various forms of state capitalism in the past, many fundamental problems in the antagonistic contradiction between the two classes have not been basically solved. Taking the situation after the joint state-private ownership of those few larger private enterprises (that is, the advanced form of state capitalism) as an example, its superiority is of course far greater than the intermediate form of state capitalism, but it has not caused fundamental changes to the antagonism of class contradictions. It is expressed in:
    First, in this kind of joint state-private ownership enterprise, the means of production are simultaneously existing in two opposite ownership systems: the socialist public ownership and the capitalist ownership.
    Second, because the profits of this kind of joint venture enterprise are distributed according to the principle of "four horses divide the spoils," when capitalists distribute enterprise profits, with the improvement of the production, operation, and management of joint venture enterprises and the improvement of the labor enthusiasm of the working masses, capitalists will exploit more from the working masses. Therefore, this kind of not completely limited exploitation is still antagonistic to giving play to the labor enthusiasm of the working masses and developing socialist productive forces.
    Third, because only a few of the private enterprises in China are large in scale, and the vast majority are small and medium-sized. They are not only very scattered in production and operation, but also generally have simple equipment and backward technology. If they are not reorganized economically and productively, it is impossible to meet the requirements of socialism. Even if all of them adopt the advanced form of state capitalism of joint state-private ownership of individual enterprises, it will only cause serious dispersion and waste of state funds, and it will be very difficult to separately allocate a large number of cadres. Besides, this method is actually not feasible. Therefore, if we only stay in the transformation stage of various forms of state capitalism in the past, it will only delay the progress of the entire socialist transformation.
    This shows that although the various forms of state capitalism developed in the past six years are superior to the capitalist economy to varying degrees, it can no longer seek profits at will, and it has been socialist in nature to varying degrees. At the same time, it also plays its due role in weakening the antagonistic contradictions between the two classes in China in the process of quantitative change in the struggle. However, due to the failure to solve the above-mentioned fundamental problems, the various contradictions emanating from the inherent evils of capitalist nature and resisting socialism basically continue to exist. Therefore, even this special capitalism with socialist nature has not fundamentally deviated from the category of capitalism in terms of the capitalist ownership of the means of production and the relationship of exploitation. Therefore, reflected in class relations, the antagonism of this contradiction has not undergone a fundamental qualitative change. But in any case, this is after all the completion of the first step in the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, and this step itself has laid a solid foundation for the second step.
    Socialism cannot be built on the basis of two mutually opposed ownership systems of the means of production. At the same time, due to the development of state capitalist economy over the years, one foot of the bourgeoisie has actually been brought into the threshold of socialism, and the other foot has to follow in. The rapid progress of the national socialist industrialization, especially the accelerated development of agricultural cooperativization, finally cut off the road for the development of rural capitalism, which will inevitably vigorously promote the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce. Therefore, from the third quarter of last year to the first quarter of this year, a new upsurge has also been set off in the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, and it has begun to enter a completely new stage. That is, from the transformation stage mainly in the intermediate form of state capitalism, supplemented by joint state-private ownership of some individual enterprises, it has been promoted to the new stage of joint state-private ownership of the entire industry. At the same time, the state also implemented a fixed interest rate method to distribute dividends to shareholders and purchase the means of production occupied by them from the bourgeoisie. The implementation of joint state-private ownership of the entire industry and the fixed interest rate method marks the basic end of the first step of the state's socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, and the beginning of the second step. From then on, this socialist transformation has embarked on a new stage of transforming the state capitalist economy into a socialist economy. The arrival of this new stage is an inevitable trend in China's planned development and transformation of the national economy in accordance with the goal of building socialism. It is a step of decisive significance for gradually eliminating exploitation and changing the capitalist ownership of the means of production. It means that the means of production originally occupied by the bourgeoisie have basically been transferred to the state's control, and socialism has basically replaced capitalism. The antagonistic contradiction between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie is caused by factors such as the capitalist ownership of the means of production and the relationship of exploitation. Then the fundamental change in the relations of production cannot but cause a change in the nature of the contradiction. Therefore, from then on, the antagonistic contradiction between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in China's transition period has been basically transformed into a non-antagonistic contradiction. The essence of the change in the nature of the contradiction between the two classes after the implementation of joint state-private ownership of the entire industry and the fixed interest rate method can be seen from the following main changes:
    First, after the fundamental change in the relations of production of the enterprise, the capitalist's ownership of the means of production of the enterprise is only manifested in the shares and dividends that should be obtained. The capitalist can no longer control the enterprise, and the actual power has been transferred to the state. Capitalists can only work under the leadership of the state like ordinary staff. The dividends obtained by capitalists have basically failed to play the role of capital.
    Second, it is more conducive to implementing the state's policy of overall planning and unified arrangement to carry out reforms in the entire industry according to socialist principles. In this kind of joint state-private ownership enterprise, the socialist economic component has established a solid leading position in the entire industry (not only in individual enterprise units). In particular, the production of the entire industry can be included in the state plan, and the operation and management of the entire industry can also be carried out in a socialist way. The state's investment and cadre allocation can also be used centrally.
    Third, capitalists and capitalist agents will be given appropriate job arrangements and will generally be given opportunities for education and transformation.
    Fourth, after the implementation of the fixed interest rate method, it not only guarantees that capitalists can obtain certain dividends during the joint venture period, but also strictly restricts capitalists' exploitation. This exploitation is not only more strictly limited to a certain absolute figure in quantity than the "four horses divide the spoils" (calculated based on the total value of 3.3 billion yuan of all capitalist enterprises in the country, 165 million yuan is paid annually as dividends). Moreover, the results caused by this exploitative relationship have also undergone great changes. The proletariat voluntarily pays this part of the dividend, which has basically blocked all loopholes for capitalists to seek profits. Moreover, this part of the dividend is not the capitalist's direct exploitation of the working masses in their own enterprises, but a limited ransom paid by the entire proletariat from the social wealth it has created to the bourgeoisie. This further consolidates the unity and unification within the entire proletariat.
    The implementation of joint state-private ownership of the entire industry and the fixed interest rate method is a big step forward towards socialist nationalization. Most of the bourgeoisie are willing to accept and have accepted this method. It is not accidental that the bourgeoisie can accept it. As mentioned earlier, it is the result of the development of the long-term contradiction and struggle between the two classes. It has been evolved under various special conditions. More importantly, it is when the socialist transformation is entering a new stage, the proletariat, through its political party—the Chinese Communist Party, further actively influences the bourgeoisie politically, economically, and ideologically, such as the policy of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision in the united front, the preferential interest rate of 5% of the fixed interest in the redemption policy, and the "leniency" spirit in the liquidation and valuation, as well as patiently telling the bourgeoisie how to recognize the laws of socialist development ideologically, how to grasp their own destiny, and so on. This makes it possible for most of the bourgeoisie to realize that the victory of the socialist cause in China is really the general trend. Then, accepting peaceful transformation has become the only bright future for the bourgeoisie. Therefore, although the bourgeoisie still inevitably shows a dual attitude of resistance in acceptance and gradual acceptance in resistance, they finally embarked on a step of decisive significance for socialist transformation amid the sound of gongs and drums, thereby making China's economic face and class relations appear unprecedentedly new:
      (1) If the value of private industrial output and the capital of private commerce in 1955 are each 100%, then after the upsurge of joint state-private ownership of the entire industry this time, 92% of private industry and 75% of private commerce have completed joint state-private ownership of the entire industry. According to the expected results of the implementation of the 1956 national economic plan, the value of private industrial output only accounts for 0.4% of the total industrial output, and private commerce only accounts for 8.9% of the total social commodity retail sales. The material basis for antagonistic contradictions has also been basically transformed into a material basis for non-antagonistic contradictions.
      (2) The new face of the bourgeoisie in the transformation also shows the possibility for them to transform into self-reliant laborers. People who originally had production technology and scientific skills have begun to play their active role in socialism. People who did not work originally are now participating in labor. People who originally did not understand enterprise operation and management work have now learned operation and management. In the socialist labor competition in major cities, many bourgeoisie have won the glorious title of advanced producers and advanced workers, and many others have received commendations and material rewards. This situation is impossible to find in the conflict of antagonistic contradictions.
    The antagonistic contradiction between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in China's transition period has gradually developed to the critical point of qualitative change by implementing the joint state-private ownership of the entire industry and the fixed interest rate method through the quantitative change process of various forms of state capitalism; it is gradually replacing capitalism with socialism, thereby making this antagonistic contradiction basically transformed into a non-antagonistic contradiction. However, because the entire process of this basic transformation has not been finally completed, the remnants of antagonistic contradictions have not been finally and fundamentally completely eliminated. Because the ownership of the means of production of joint venture enterprises is not a completely socialist ownership system, and there are still remnants of capitalist ownership. The essence of the fixed interest rate is still the bourgeoisie's exploitation of a part of the surplus value created by the proletariat's labor. The bourgeoisie as an exploiting class has not been finally eliminated. However, the remnants of this antagonistic contradiction are ultimately weakening, and, as long as the proletariat does not relax its vigilance, overcoming the remnants of this antagonistic contradiction can be carried out smoothly. According to the current rapidly developing trend, in the near future, in about a few years, under the leadership of the proletariat, with the improvement of the ideological awareness of the bourgeoisie and the mastery of labor production technology, when most people have become self-reliant laborers (by that time, even if there are still a few elderly and infirm people who cannot work, the state will give relief), the entire bourgeoisie can "naturally mature," voluntarily give up the final exploitation, cancel the fixed interest rate through political consultation, and nationalize all the means of production. By that time, China's bourgeoisie will withdraw from the historical stage with the final elimination of the capitalist ownership and capitalist exploitation, and the remnants of the antagonistic contradiction between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie will also finally and fundamentally completely disappear with the elimination of the bourgeoisie.
    How should we deal with the remnants of the antagonistic contradiction between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie at present? The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has put forward clear instructions to us on this new topic of concern to the people of the whole country, that is, the policy of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision between the Communist Party and the democratic parties, first of all, the policy of supervising the Communist Party. This new policy reflects the changes in China's class relations, reflects the changes in the nature of the contradiction between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in China, and the persuasive education method that adopts the non-antagonistic struggle form accordingly has become the main method for dealing with the remnants of the antagonistic contradiction between the two classes in China in the future. Only by continuing to work hard on the basis of the continued expansion and consolidation of the people's democratic united front, completely eliminating the remnants of the antagonistic contradiction between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie within a certain period of time, and further resolving various non-antagonistic contradictions, can we better mobilize the power of the people of the whole country to build China into a great socialist country!

    试论过渡时期我国无产阶级和资产阶级矛盾的性质
    顾明　田方
    七年来在党和政府领导下对资本主义工商业实行社会主义改造的工作，现在已经取得了决定性的胜利。从此，我国最激烈、最大规模的阶级斗争已经过去，无产阶级和资产阶级（专指民族资产阶级，下同）矛盾和斗争的演变，已经展示了它的基本规律和发展的必然趋势。及时地研究这些规律，特别是弄清楚我国当前无产阶级和资产阶级矛盾的性质问题，是有其重大的意义的。因为这就是我国当前实际性的和理论性的重要问题，就是马克思列宁主义阶级斗争学说同我国革命实践相结合和具体运用的问题。
    我国过渡时期既容许资本主义的存在，资产阶级和无产阶级之间还存在剥削和被剥削的关系，这种以不可调和的阶级利益为基础而形成的矛盾的一般性质，不能不是对抗性的。这种矛盾的对抗性，决定了我国革命在第一阶段的新民主主义胜利以后，还必须进行第二阶段的社会主义革命，这个革命的目的就是要着手解决我国无产阶级和资产阶级的对抗性矛盾。我国过渡时期虽然有这两个阶级的对抗性矛盾的存在，但是这种矛盾的性质是不能一概而论的。在我国过渡时期中阶级斗争的形势和资本主义国家里所发生的情形根本不同，无产阶级和资产阶级的矛盾在资本主义上升时代是一回事，在无产阶级专政已在九亿人口范围内取得了伟大胜利的社会主义时代又是一回事，至于在中国当前的条件下则更是另一回事。阶级斗争形势的变化决定于阶级力量的对比，阶级力量的对比发生变化，对抗性矛盾的对抗程度乃至矛盾性质本身，当然也不会是永远一成不变的。我国在过渡时期所以能够对资本家采取非对抗斗争形式的说服教育、和平改造的方针，就是因为阶级力量对比已经发生了根本变化，两个阶级的对抗性矛盾也必然会产生出它的特殊性质，这就是由于我国历史的、政治的、经济的、社会的特殊条件，决定了这一对抗性矛盾有可能不必经过爆发式的革命而转化为非对抗性矛盾。由我国长期的革命历史发展所形成的特殊条件包括：
  （一）共产党的领导；（二）无产阶级已经掌握了强大的国家机器，人民民主专政的政权性质实际上已成为无产阶级专政；（三）牢不可破的工农联盟，巩固地团结了占我国人口百分之八、九十的工人阶级和农民阶级；（四）社会主义经济基础日益壮大，已经成为整个国民经济中坚强的领导力量；（五）文化、思想战线上已奠定了无产阶级的领导地位；（六）资产阶级的两重性，以及我党长期地耐心地进行争取、教育工作后，已把资产阶级中大多数人吸引到人民革命的队伍中来。（七）人民民主统一战线在过去已经发挥了它的作用，今后还将继续发挥它的伟大作用；（八）我国革命的胜利，正处于社会主义已经成为世界体系的有利的国际形势中。要正确认识我国过渡时期无产阶级和资产阶级的矛盾性质及其特殊性质，就必须首先明确我国历史发展中的这些特殊条件。
    开国以来，经过抗美援朝运动、土地改革运动、镇压反革命运动、统购统销政策的贯彻，特别是农业合作化运动的高潮等一系列的胜利，把资产阶级长时期以来同帝国主义、封建主义、农村资本主义（富农经济）的千丝万缕的在政治、经济、思想上的联系基本上割断了。随着人民民主专政的巩固，社会主义经济日益壮大，社会主义改造逐步深入，国家资本主义范围扩大又逐步向国有化过渡，私人资本主义逐步缩小以至于消失，统一战线工作继续发挥它的作用，资产阶级逐步认清了历史发展的必然规律，决心掌握自己的命运，因而被迫于大势所趋而又自愿地放弃剥削，争取成为自食其力的劳动者，是完全可能，而且正在逐步实现着。所以上述我国过渡时期无产阶级和资产阶级矛盾斗争的发展趋势，也就是矛盾性质在斗争中逐步转化的过程，就是矛盾的对抗性逐步削弱，非对抗性逐步增长的过程。
    从我国无产阶级和资产阶级矛盾斗争的发展过程中展示了一条基本规律，就是：克服矛盾的各种斗争形式是由矛盾性质决定的，什么性质的矛盾用什么样的斗争形式去克服。但是这不是绝对的，根据事物的具体发展，在一定条件下，不仅斗争形式可以发生变化，而且矛盾性质也会发生变化。矛盾性质不通过一定形式的斗争是不可能克服或改变的，斗争形式仅仅是为了克服或改变矛盾性质而存在的，人们正确地掌握斗争形式可以影响甚至改变矛盾性质，但是最后终究还是由矛盾性质来决定适合它本身的斗争形式，才能最后正确地克服一定性质的矛盾。我国过渡时期无产阶级和资产阶级矛盾斗争的变化发展，正是按照这个规律逐步向前推进的。
    我国过渡时期无产阶级和资产阶级的对抗性矛盾曾一度爆发为对抗斗争，这就是资产阶级发动的“五毒”进攻和在党和政府的领导下，工人阶级和全国人民开展的“三反”“五反”运动。“三反”“五反”打退了资产阶级的猖狂进攻，资产阶级经过这一场剧烈的斗争，才从事实上承认了无产阶级的领导，从而在一定程度上削弱了两个阶级对抗性矛盾的对抗程度。
    总路线的提出和宪法的制定是中国人民胜利后两件大喜事，它根据我国过渡时期的许多历史特点和历史发展的必然规律规定了我国社会主义改造和社会主义建设的具体道路和具体方法。它的根本目的，是要将我国多种经济成分的不同的所有制转变为单一的社会主义所有制，消灭剥削和贫困。按照宪法的规定，国家对资本主义工商业实行社会主义改造的具体步骤是分两步走，即第一步把资本主义转变为各种不同形式的国家资本主义，第二步把国家资本主义转变为社会主义。
    对资本主义工商业实行社会主义改造采取国家资本主义过渡形式的方针，是我国阶级斗争的特殊形式，我国对资本主义工商业实行社会主义改造，在过去六年中，已经取得了很大的成绩，但是如果只是停留在以大部分国家资本主义的中级形式和一部分个别企业公私合营的那种高级形式的国家资本主义，是不能适应整个社会主义事业发展的要求的。也就是说：对资本主义工商业实行社会主义改造只停留在第一个步骤，而不推进到第二个步骤，不把国家资本主义的经济转变为社会主义的经济，是不可能从根本上克服无产阶级和资产阶级的对抗性矛盾的。我们可以发现，对资本主义工商业实现了以往各种形式的国家资本主义以后，两个阶级对抗性矛盾中许多根本问题并未基本解决，以那些少数规模较大的私营企业进行个别单位的公私合营（即高级形式的国家资本主义）以后的情况来说，当然它的优越性是大大超过了中级形式的国家资本主义的，但是它对阶级矛盾的对抗性并没有引起根本上的变化。表现在：
    第一，在这种个别公私合营的企业里，生产资料是社会主义的全民所有制和资本家所有制这两种对立的所有制是同时存在的。
    第二，由于这种合营企业的利润是按“四马分肥”的原则分配的，资本家在分配企业利润的时候，随着合营企业生产经营管理的改善和工人群众劳动积极性的提高，资本家从工人群众身上所进行的剥削也就越多。因此，这种不是完全有限制的剥削，同发挥工人群众的劳动积极性和发展社会主义生产力仍是互相对抗的。
    第三，由于我国一般私营企业中规模大的只是少数，而为数众多的是中小型的，它们不仅在生产经营上是十分分散，而且一般是设备简陋、技术落后，如果不经过经济和生产的改组，是不可能适应社会主义的要求的。即使对它们全部采取个别企业公私合营的高级形式的国家资本主义，也只会造成国家资金严重的分散和浪费，要分别大量配备干部也十分困难，何况实际上这种办法也是行不通的。因此，如果只停留在以往各种形式的国家资本主义的改造阶段，只会延缓整个社会主义改造的进展。
    由此说明：在过去六年中发展起来的各种形式的国家资本主义，虽然在不同程度上优于资本主义经济，它已经不能为所欲为地唯利是图，它已经在不同程度上带有社会主义性质，同时它对我国两个阶级的对抗性矛盾在斗争的量变过程中，也发挥它应有的削弱作用。但是由于上述种种根本问题不能解决，从资本主义本质的劣根性上散发出来的种种和社会主义相对抗的矛盾基本上仍继续存在。所以即使这种具有社会主义性质的特殊的资本主义，仍没有从生产资料的资本家所有制和剥削关系等本质上脱离资本主义的范畴。因此，反映到阶级关系上这种矛盾的对抗性还没有从根本上发生质的变化。但无论如何，这毕竟是完成了对资本主义工商业实行社会主义改造的第一步，而且这一步本身已经为第二步打下了稳妥的基础。
    社会主义是不可能建立在两种相互对立的生产资料所有制的基础上的；同时，由于历年来国家资本主义经济的发展，资产阶级的一只脚实际已经被带进了社会主义的门槛，而另一只脚也已经非跟着进来不可了；而国家社会主义工业化的迅速进展，特别是农业合作化的加快发展，最后断绝了农村资本主义发展的道路，这就必然会有力地推动对资本主义工商业实行社会主义改造。因此，从去年第三季度到今年第一季度，对资本主义工商业实行社会主义改造也掀起了一个新的高潮，开始进入了一个完全崭新的阶段。这就是从以国家资本主义中级形式为主，辅以部分个别企业的公私合营的改造阶段，推进到全行业公私合营的新阶段；与此同时，国家还实行了定息办法，给股东分配股息，向资产阶级购买为其占有的生产资料。实行全行业公私合营和定息的办法，标志着国家对资本主义工商业实行社会主义改造第一步的基本结束，和第二步的开始。从此，这一社会主义改造已经走上了把国家资本主义经济转变为社会主义经济的新阶段。这个新阶段的到来，是我国根据建设社会主义的目标，有计划的发展和改造国民经济的一个必然趋势，是对逐步消灭剥削，改变生产资料的资本家所有制具有决定性意义的一步；意味着资产阶级原来占有的生产资料基本上已经转为国家所掌握了，社会主义基本上已经代替了资本主义。无产阶级和资产阶级的对抗性矛盾，既然是由生产资料的资本家所有制和剥削关系等因素所引起的，那么生产关系的根本变化，就不能不引起矛盾性质的变化。因此，从此以后，我国过渡时期无产阶级和资产阶级的对抗性矛盾便基本上转化为非对抗性矛盾了。从下述主要变化中便可以看出实行全行业公私合营和定息办法后两个阶级矛盾性质变化的实质：
    第一，企业的生产关系发生了根本变化后，资本家对企业的生产资料所有权，只表现于应得的股额和股息上，资本家已经不能掌握企业，实际权力已经转到国家手里了，资本家只能和普通工作人员一样在国家的领导下做工作。资本家取得的股息已经基本上发生不了资本的作用了。
    第二，能够按照社会主义原则对全行业实行改革，更有利于贯彻国家实行全面规划、统筹安排的方针。在这种公私合营企业里，社会主义经济成份已经在全行业（不仅在个别企业单位）中树立了牢固的领导地位，特别是全行业生产可以纳入国家计划的轨道，全行业的经营管理也可以按照社会主义方式进行，国家的投资和干部配备也可以集中使用了。
    第三，资本家和资本家代理人都将得到适当的工作安排并将普遍地得到教育和改造的机会。
    第四，实行定息的办法以后，既保障了资本家在合营期间取得一定的股息，又严格地限制了资本家的剥削，这种剥削不仅在数量上已经比
  “四马分肥”更严格地限制在一定的绝对数字上
  （以全国全部资本主义企业总值三十三亿元计，每年支付股息一亿六千五百万元）。而且这种剥削关系引起的结果也是发生了很大变化的。无产阶级自愿地支付这部分股息，已经基本上堵塞了资本家唯利是图的一切漏洞；而且这部分股息，已经不是资本家对本企业工人群众直接的剥削，而是整个无产阶级从它本身所创造的社会财富中支付一部分有限的赎金给资产阶级的赎买关系；从而进一步巩固了整个无产阶级内部的团结和统一。
    实行全行业公私合营和定息办法，是向社会主义国有化前进了一大步，对这种办法，资产阶级分子中大多数人是愿意接受而且已经接受了。资产阶级分子之所以能够接受并不是偶然的，正如前边已经说过的，是经过两个阶级长时期矛盾斗争的过程发展而来的，是具备了各种特殊条件演变而来的，而且更重要的还在于正当社会主义改造进入新阶段的时候，无产阶级通过它的政党——中国共产党又进一步地从政治上、经济上、思想上对资产阶级分子主动地给予积极的影响，诸如统一战线中长期共存、互相监督的方针，赎买政策中定息五厘的优惠息率和清产估价中的“宽”“了”精神，以及循循善诱地告诉资产阶级分子怎样从思想上认清社会主义发展的规律，如何掌握自己的命运等等。这就使得资产阶级分子中大多数人有可能认识到，社会主义事业在我国的胜利真是大势所趋的了。那么，接受和平改造也就成为资产阶级分子唯一的光明出路了。于是，资产阶级分子中虽然仍不免表现出在接受中有抵抗，在抵抗中又逐步接受的两重性态度，但最后终究在锣鼓喧天声中兴高采烈地踏上了社会主义改造的具有决定性意义的一步，从而使我国的经济面貌和阶级关系出现了空前未有的新景象：
      （1）如果以1955年的私营工业产值和私营商业的资本额各为100％，则经过这次全行业公私合营的高潮后，在私营工业中已经有92％，在私营商业中已经有75％完成了全行业公私合营。而按1956年国民经济计划执行的预期结果，私营工业产值只占工业总产值的0.4％了，私营商业在社会商品零售总额中也只剩下8.9％了。对抗性矛盾的物质基础从此也基本上转化为非对抗性矛盾的物质基础了。
      （2）资产阶级分子在改造中的新面貌，也表现了他们能够转变为自食其力的劳动者的可能了。原来有生产技术和科学技能的人，已开始发挥了他们对社会主义的积极作用。原来不劳动的人现在参加劳动了。原来不懂得企业经营管理工作的人，现在学会了经营管理。各大城市资产阶级分子在参加社会主义劳动竞赛中，已经有许多人获得了先进生产者和先进工作者的光荣称号，还有许多人得到了表扬和物质奖励。这种情况是不可能从对抗性矛盾的冲突中发现的。
    我国过渡时期无产阶级和资产阶级的对抗性矛盾，就是这样地经过各种形式的国家资本主义的量变过程，逐步地发展到以实行全行业公私合营和定息办法这一质变的关节点；就是这样逐步地以社会主义代替资本主义，从而使得这一对抗性矛盾基本上转化为非对抗性矛盾。但是由于这个基本转化的整个过程还没有最后完成，所以对抗性矛盾的残余也没有最后的从根本上完全消失。因为合营企业的生产资料所有制还不是完全的社会主义所有制，还存在着资本家所有制的残余。定息的实质，依然是资产阶级剥削无产阶级劳动创造的一部分剩余价值。作为剥削阶级的资产阶级还没有最后被消灭。但是这种对抗性矛盾的残余，终究是日趋衰弱的，而且，只要无产阶级不放松警惕，克服这种对抗性矛盾的残余是可以顺利进行的。按照目前飞跃发展的趋势看来，在不久的将来，大约再有几年时间，在无产阶级领导下，随着资产阶级分子思想觉悟的提高，对劳动生产技术能力的掌握，大多数人已能成为自食其力的劳动者的时候（到那时即使尚有少数年老力衰不能劳动的人，国家也会给予救济），整个资产阶级就可以“瓜熟蒂落”，自愿放弃最后的剥削，经过政治协商取消定息，使全部生产资料国有化。到那时候，我国资产阶级就将随着资本家所有制和资本主义剥削的最后消灭而退出历史舞台，而无产阶级和资产阶级的对抗性矛盾的残余，也将随着资产阶级的消灭而最后从根本上完全消失。
    目前我们应当怎样来处理无产阶级和资产阶级的对抗性矛盾的残余呢？对于这一全国人民当前的新课题，中共中央已经向我们提出了明确的指示，即共产党和各民主党派长期共同存在、互相监督，首先是对共产党起监督作用的方针，这个新方针反映了我国阶级关系的变化，反映了我国无产阶级和资产阶级矛盾性质的变化，以及随之而来的，采取非对抗斗争形式的说服教育方法，便成为今后处理我国两个阶级对抗性矛盾的残余的主要方法了。只有在继续扩大和巩固的人民民主统一战线的基础上，继续努力，在一定的时期内，彻底消除无产阶级和资产阶级的对抗性矛盾的残余，和进一步解决各种非对抗性矛盾，才能更有利于动员全国人民力量，把我国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义国家！
