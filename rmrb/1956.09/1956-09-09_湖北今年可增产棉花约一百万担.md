Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 8th: Female members of agricultural cooperatives in Hubei Province are busily picking new cotton in more than eight million mu of cotton fields. In front of the newly built cotton warehouses of various agricultural cooperatives, drying racks are filled with cotton; the white cotton floss on the racks glitters brightly.

Hubei Province has had a bumper cotton harvest this year. If it does not suffer any unexpected disasters in the future, it is estimated that the province can harvest about four million dan of ginned cotton, an increase of about one million dan over last year, exceeding this year's production plan by more than 20%.

Recently, the Hubei Provincial Department of Agriculture has received almost daily good news reports of cotton harvests from various places. The "hundred-jin townships" and "hundred-jin cooperatives" (referring to an average yield of 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu) appearing in the Jianghan Plain and the eastern Hubei cotton area are becoming more and more numerous. In the famous "Eight Treasures Cotton Area" of Songzi County, approximately 30,000 to 50,000 mu of cotton fields can achieve a high yield of more than 100 jin (ginned cotton), accounting for one-third to one-half of the cotton field area in this region. High-yielding fields that have broken Hubei Province's highest cotton yield record of more than 200 jin of ginned cotton per mu have also been successively discovered in various places.

The reasons for the bumper cotton harvest in Hubei Province this year are, on the one hand, the mild climate and even rainfall; at the same time, the basic realization of agricultural cooperation throughout the province has created superior conditions for improving cotton cultivation management techniques, widely promoting excellent varieties, and overcoming various natural disasters. The Jianghan Plain and eastern Hubei, the two major cotton areas, have basically become popular areas for the Dai character cotton varieties this year, while last year the area planted with improved varieties only accounted for about a quarter. In some areas of Xiangyang Prefecture in the upper reaches of the Han River, which have always been low-yielding cotton areas, this year, due to the promotion of improved varieties, the selection of local original varieties, and the cultivation and increased application of fertilizers, the yield and quality of cotton have been significantly improved.

This year, Hubei Province has repeatedly experienced widespread cotton pest infestations. Thanks to the state's timely allocation of large quantities of pesticides and agricultural machinery, and strong support for the agricultural cooperatives in cotton-growing areas in their struggle to eliminate pests, and with banks and agricultural product purchasing departments pre-paying huge amounts of cotton purchase deposits to help farmers in cotton-growing areas solve their production and living difficulties, each pest infestation was quickly extinguished by the vast number of farmers shortly after it was discovered, preventing the spread of the pests. In order to prevent the cotton they had acquired from being lost, members of the agricultural cooperatives were very careful in their picking work. Most agricultural cooperatives have established special institutions for picking, drying, and warehousing cotton. The cooperatives with more cotton planting have built and renovated cotton warehouses. The cotton picked on the same day is handed over to the drying team to dry it and then put into the warehouse at any time, and sold to the state purchasing stations in batches.

### 湖北今年可增产棉花约一百万担

    湖北今年可增产棉花约一百万担
    新华社武汉8日电　湖北省各地农业社的女社员们，正在八百多万亩棉田里紧张地采摘新棉，各农业社新搭起的棉花库房门前，摆满了晒棉的帘架，帘上白皑皑的棉絮光耀眩目。
    湖北省今年棉花获得大丰收，如果今后不遭受意外灾害，估计全省大约可以采摘四百万担皮棉，比去年增加一百万担左右，超过今年的生产计划两成多。
    近来，湖北省农业厅几乎每天都收到各地棉花丰收的喜报。江汉平原和鄂东棉区出现的“百斤乡”、“百斤社”（指平均亩产百斤皮棉），越来越多了。在松滋县著名的“八宝棉区”，约有三万到五万亩棉田可以达到百斤（皮棉）以上的高额丰产，占这个地区棉田面积的三分之一到一半左右。突破湖北省棉花最高丰产纪录每亩产二百多斤皮棉的丰产田，各地也陆续发现不少。
    今年湖北省棉花获得丰收的原因，一方面是气候温和雨水匀调；同时也是全省基本上实现农业合作化，为改进棉花栽培管理技术、广泛推广优良品种和克服各种自然灾害创造了优越条件。江汉平原和鄂东两大棉区，今年已经基本上成为岱字棉良种的普及区，而去年这里的良种面积只占四分之一左右。汉江上游襄阳专区的一部分地区，一向是棉花低产区，今年也因为推广良种、精选当地原有的品种、培育和增施肥料，使棉花产量和质量都有显著提高。
    湖北省今年曾经屡次普遍发生过棉花虫害，由于国家及时拨出大批农药、农械，大力支援棉区农业社扑灭虫害的斗争；银行和农产品采购部门又预付了巨额的棉花收购定金，帮助棉区农民解决生产和生活中的困难，因此每次虫害发现不久，就被广大农民迅速扑灭，制止了虫害的蔓延。农业社社员为了不使到手的棉花遭受损失，对采摘工作都很小心在意。大多数农业社都分别成立了拣花、晒花进仓保管的专门机构。种棉花较多的社都新盖和整修了棉花仓库，当天采摘的棉花当天交晒花组晒干后，随时归仓，分批向国家采购站出售。
