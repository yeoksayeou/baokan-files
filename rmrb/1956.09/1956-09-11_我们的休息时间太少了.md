    Our Rest Time is Too Short
    The Xi'an First Garment Production Cooperative has more than 180 members. Due to poor working and sanitary conditions, 62 people have already contracted tuberculosis. Many are pale and emaciated.
    In addition to working ten hours a day, members of this cooperative have four routine meetings per week, each lasting at least two hours, and temporary meetings at least once or twice a week, each lasting one or two hours. In reality, members have to work and attend meetings for about twelve hours a day. At the same time, they only get one day off every two weeks, and only had one day off in a month and a half at the beginning of this year. The members eat twice a day, but each time only for half an hour. As for work-break exercises, they are out of the question. This is the root cause affecting the health of the members.
    The members are calling for shorter working hours, fewer meetings, and prevention of the spread of disease.

### 我们的休息时间太少了

    我们的休息时间太少了
    西安第一服装生产合作社有社员一百八十多人，由于工作和卫生条件差，已经有六十二人患肺结核。不少人都是面黄肌瘦。
    这个社的社员每天除工作十小时外，每星期还有例会四次，每次会议最少两小时，临时性会议最少每星期有一两次，每次一两小时。实际上，社员们每天要工作和开会约十二小时。同时，每两个星期才休息一天，今年年初的一个半月才只休息了一天。社员们每天吃两次饭，但是每次只有半点钟。至于工间操更谈不到。这就是影响社员身体健康的根源。
    社员们的呼声是，缩短工作时间，减少会议，防止疾病的蔓延。
