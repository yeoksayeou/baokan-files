    Shanxi Organizes Social Transportation力量 to Rush Transportation of Backlogged Materials

    In order to eliminate transportation bottlenecks, the Shanxi Province highway transportation departments, starting in April, dispatched a large number of cadres to widely organize agricultural and sideline vehicles and the surplus transportation power of organs, factories, and mines to participate in transportation. Currently, more than 1,000 rural sideline rubber-tired vehicles, 4,600 iron-wheeled vehicles, nearly 600 pack animals, 37 vehicles from organizations and factorys and mines, and a portion of the human-powered cargo carts scattered in the cities have been organized. In addition, 79 vehicles from state-owned companies have implemented a "double-shift" transportation system. From April to July, this batch of vehicles mobilized from all sectors of society carried out a rush transport of more than 5 million ton-kilometers of backlogged materials, equivalent to an increase of about 200 vehicles per month in transportation capacity, resolving the difficulty of insufficient transportation capacity in Shanxi Province.

    In order to further unleash the potential of social transportation, make up for the deficiencies of state-owned transportation tools, encourage the enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers to support national industrial construction, and continue to solve the problem of transportation bottlenecks, the Shanxi Provincial Transportation Balance Conference recently made the following regulations: (1) Agricultural and sideline horse-drawn carts participating in the rush transportation of backlogged materials, if the owner has a certificate from the local government, can be exempted from road maintenance fees and transportation department handling fees; (2) Provide feed subsidies for livestock of agricultural and sideline vehicles participating in temporary transportation; (3) The grain departments will establish 130 grain and grass supply stations on the main transportation routes, and the hotels will sell grain and grass on the secondary routes to solve the problem of livestock grain and grass supply; (4) Strengthen the maintenance and repair of roads, and promptly repair the highways damaged by floods to facilitate vehicle traffic.

    山西组织社会运输力量抢运积压物资
    山西省公路运输部门为消除运输堵塞现象，从4月份起，派出大批干部，广泛组织农副业车辆和机关、厂矿的剩余运输力量参加运输，目前已组织到农村副业胶轮车一千多辆，铁轮车四千六百辆，驮力近六百头，机关、厂矿汽车三十七辆和一部分流散在城市的人力拉货车，并有七十九辆国营公司的汽车实行“双班制”运输。这批从社会各方面动员出来的车辆在4月份至7月份，突击运输了五百多万吨公里的积压物资，约等于每个月增加了二百多辆汽车的运输能力，解决了山西省运输力不足的困难。
    为了进一步发挥社会运输潜力，弥补国营运输工具的不足，鼓励广大农民支援国家工业建设的积极性，继续解决运输堵塞问题，最近山西省运输平衡会议还做了如下规定：（一）参加突击运输积压物资的农副业运输马车，凡车主有当地政府证明者，可以免收养路费和运输部门的手续费；（二）对临时参加运输的农副业车辆的牲畜，给予饲料补贴；（三）由粮食部门在主要运输路线上，设立一百三十个谷草供应站，在次要路线上由旅店代售谷草，解决牲畜谷草供应的困难；（四）加强道路的维护、整修，及时抢修被水毁坏的公路，便利车辆通行。
