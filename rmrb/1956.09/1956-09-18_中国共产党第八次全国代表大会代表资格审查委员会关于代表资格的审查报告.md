    Report on the Examination of Credentials of Delegates to the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China
    Director of the Credentials Committee of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China: Dong Biwu
    Entrusted by the Credentials Committee of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, I now report to the Congress on the results of the examination of the credentials of the delegates as follows:
    According to the "Resolution on Convening the Eighth National Congress of the Party" and the "Regulations on the Number of Delegates and Election Methods for the Eighth National Congress of the Party" of the Sixth Plenary Session (Enlarged) of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in October 1955, and according to the statistical figures of national party members at the end of June 1955, a total of 1,026 delegates and 107 alternate delegates were elected from among 8,545,916 communist party members nationwide. The election of the above-mentioned delegates was carried out in 31 electoral units according to different circumstances. The delegates from each province, municipality directly under the central government, autonomous region, as well as the central government organs and central state organs, were elected by the party congresses of these units; the delegates from the Tibet region were elected by the party congress of the Tibet region; the delegates from the Chinese People's Liberation Army, except for the delegates from the Tibet Military Region who were elected by the party congress of the Tibet Military Region, were elected by the party congresses of each military region, each military service, each branch of service, and the directly subordinate units of the General Headquarters; the delegates from the Chinese People's Volunteers were elected by the party congress of the Chinese People's Volunteers.
    Among the 1,026 delegates, 17 were unable to attend this Congress due to illness or other matters. They have been replaced by the alternate delegates from the original electoral units, including one delegate from the Tibet Working Committee who has not yet arrived due to traffic obstruction. Therefore, the actual number of delegates attending this Congress is 1,025.
    The Credentials Committee of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China has examined the credentials of each of the 1,026 delegates individually, based on the relevant materials of the delegates. The result of the examination is that the election of all delegates complies with the provisions of the Sixth Plenary Session (Enlarged) of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China regarding the number of delegates and election methods for the Eighth National Congress of the Party. Their credentials are all valid.
    The above report is submitted to the Congress for deliberation and approval.

    中国共产党第八次全国代表大会代表资格审查委员会关于代表资格的审查报告
    中国共产党第八次全国代表大会代表资格审查委员会主任　董必武
    我受中国共产党第八次全国代表大会代表资格审查委员会的委托，现在将代表资格的审查结果，向大会作如下报告：
    根据一九五五年十月中国共产党第七届六中全会（扩大）“关于召开党的第八次全国代表大会的决议”和“关于党的第八次全国代表大会代表名额和选举办法的规定”、按照一九五五年六月底全国党员的统计数字，在全国八、五四五、九一六名共产党员中，共选出了代表一、○二六名，候补代表一○七名。上述代表的选举，是在三十一个选举单位按照不同情况进行的。各省、直辖市、自治区以及中央直属机关、中央国家机关的代表，都由这些单位的党的代表大会选出；西藏地区的代表，由西藏地区党的代表会议选出；中国人民解放军的代表，除西藏军区的代表由西藏军区党的代表会议选出外，都分别由各军区、各军种、各兵种以及总直属队党的代表大会选出；中国人民志愿军的代表，由中国人民志愿军党的代表大会选出。
    在一、○二六名代表中，因病因事不能出席这次代表大会的有十七名，已经由原选举单位的候补代表如数递补，其中有西藏工委代表一名，因交通阻塞尚未赶到，所以现在出席这次代表大会的代表实有一、○二五名。
    中国共产党第八次全国代表大会代表资格审查委员会，根据代表的有关材料，对一、○二六名的代表资格逐个地进行了审查。审查结果，认为所有代表的选举都符合中国共产党第七届六中全会（扩大）关于党的第八次全国代表大会代表名额和选举办法的规定。他们的代表资格都是有效的。
    以上报告，请大会审议通过。
                            一九五六年九月十七日
