Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, September 3rd: The CCP Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region Committee recently instructed Party committees at and above the county level within the Autonomous Region to conduct an inspection of the implementation of ethnic policies before the end of October or December.

In its instructions to various localities, the Autonomous Region Committee pointed out: Over the past few years, the Party organizations of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region have correctly implemented the Party's ethnic policies, enhanced the ideological awareness of all ethnic groups to love the motherland, and established and consolidated the relationship of unity and fraternity among all ethnic groups, thereby ensuring the decisive victory of the socialist transformation cause in the Autonomous Region, the great development of economic and cultural construction, and the great improvement of the material and cultural life of the people. However, there are still shortcomings or issues that need to be resolved in terms of emphasizing ethnic characteristics, respecting ethnic customs and habits, cultivating and using ethnic minority cadres, and how autonomous organs at all levels can fully exercise their autonomous rights. Therefore, a thorough and comprehensive inspection of the implementation of ethnic policies to overcome shortcomings, solve problems, criticize and prevent nationalistic tendencies, especially great-Han chauvinism, will better implement the Party's ethnic policies, further enhance ethnic unity, improve work, and fully mobilize the enthusiasm of ethnic minority cadres and the masses.

The instructions specified the focus of inspections for various organs, organizations, military systems, universities, agriculture, animal husbandry, counties, the city of Urumqi, and autonomous units at and above the county level, and also required leaders at all levels to attach importance, mobilize the entire Party, and conduct the inspections under the leadership of Party organizations in various regions and departments. The inspections should be conducted in the spirit of seeking truth from facts, and widely solicit the opinions and criticisms of the people to enhance understanding and educate cadres.
