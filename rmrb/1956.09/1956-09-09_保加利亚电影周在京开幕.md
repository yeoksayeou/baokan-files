Xinhua News Agency, September 8th: The opening ceremony of the Bulgarian Film Week was held tonight at the Capital Cinema in Beijing.

Wang Lanxi, Director of the Film Bureau of the Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China, spoke at the opening ceremony. He said that in order to celebrate the 12th anniversary of Bulgaria's liberation, the Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China has decided to hold the second Bulgarian Film Week in ten cities in our country.

Cooperation and exchange in film between our two countries has a very good foundation. From 1953 to 1955, six excellent Bulgarian films were shown in China. According to incomplete statistics, the total number of viewers exceeded 15.5 million. China Film Week has also been held in Bulgaria and has been well received by Bulgarian audiences. He said that on this good foundation, our second Bulgarian Film Week will certainly be a complete success.

Eteropolski, Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of the Bulgarian Embassy in China, spoke and expressed gratitude to the Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China on behalf of the People's Republic of Bulgaria.

Eteropolski said that the color film "Singing and Dancing Visit to China," jointly produced by Chinese and Bulgarian filmmakers, was recently released in Bulgaria. This film records the visit and performance of the Bulgarian People's Army Song and Dance Troupe in China. The film is a crystallization of the friendship between Chinese and Bulgarian filmmakers. Finally, he wished the friendship between the people of China and Bulgaria would grow day by day.

Afterwards, "The Earth Returns to Spring," one of the films shown during the Film Week, was screened.

Chen Kehan, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China, and more than a thousand people from all walks of life in the capital attended the opening ceremony. Members of foreign embassies in China also attended the opening ceremony.

The Bulgarian Film Week will begin simultaneously in ten cities: Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Shenyang, Harbin, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Chongqing, Xi'an, and Urumqi, starting from September 9. The films screened during the Film Week include "The Earth Returns to Spring" and "Things Happen on the Street." The excellent Bulgarian film "Heroes of September," which has been shown in our country, will also be re-released in various places at the same time.
