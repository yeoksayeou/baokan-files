Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, 8th. The Henan Youth Volunteer Reclamation Team, participating in the Xinjiang Military Region Agricultural Production Corps of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, is opening up wasteland on the Suxingtan wilderness on the edge of the Gurbantunggut Desert between the Tianshan and Altai Mountains to establish a mechanized farm. More than 2,200 young men and women have already reclaimed tens of thousands of acres of wasteland into arable land. This winter, they will sow winter wheat and other crops on more than 110,000 acres of newly reclaimed wasteland.

This youth volunteer reclamation team is part of the more than 40,000 young people who came from Henan in June this year to support the construction of Xinjiang. Now, according to the plan for the construction of the Suxingtan Farm, they have formed organizations such as reclamation teams, work stations, and capital construction teams. They are working hard on land reclamation while enthusiastically learning new agricultural technologies. In August, the farm opened a tractor training class for the young people. After a short period of study, 67 young men and women have learned the structural performance, installation, and maintenance techniques of tractors, seeders, and five-furrow plows. Many young men and women in love in the youth volunteer reclamation team have already married or are engaged, and they plan to settle down here and create a better life.

The Suxingtan Farm was planned by the Xinjiang Military Region Agricultural Production Corps of the People's Liberation Army in March this year and has more than 120,000 acres of cultivated land. After the farm is completed, all farming will be done by machines.

    河南省青年志愿垦荒队
    在苏兴滩开荒建场
    新华社乌鲁木齐8日电　参加中国人民解放军新疆军区农业生产部队的河南省青年志愿垦荒队，正在天山和阿尔泰山之间古尔班通古特大沙漠边缘的苏兴滩荒野上开拓荒地，建立一个机械化农场。二千二百多名男女青年已经把数万亩荒地开垦为可耕土地，今年冬季他们将在十一万多亩新开垦的荒地上播种冬麦等作物。
    这支青年志愿垦荒队是今年6月间从河南来支援新疆建设的四万多名青年中的一部分。现在他们已经按照苏兴滩农场建设的规划，组成了开荒队、作业站和基本建设队等组织，他们一面紧张地进行开荒工作，一面热情地学习农业新技术。8月间农场为青年们开办了一个拖拉机训练班，六十七名男女青年，经过了短时期的学习，已经学会了拖拉机、播种机和五铧犁的构造性能、安装和保养等技术。青年志愿垦荒队里很多相爱的青年男女已经结了婚或订了婚，她们准备在这里安家立业，创造美好的生活。
    苏兴滩农场是人民解放军新疆军区农业生产部队在今年3月间规划的，拥有十二万多亩耕地。农场建成后，将全部使用机器耕种。
