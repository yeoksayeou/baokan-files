The Lanzhou Refinery Under Construction
Yan Shugui

China's first modern large-scale oil refinery—the Lanzhou Refinery—is under intense construction.

The complete design and main equipment of this factory are supplied by the Soviet Union. According to the design requirements, the entire oil processing operation will be highly mechanized, with more than 7,000 automatic control and indicating instruments throughout the factory. Because the equipment is modern, the amount of crude oil processed is very large, and the crude oil utilization rate is very high. The variety of commodities is also complete, including various fuel oils and lubricating oils.

A Tense and Busy Construction Site

At the construction site of the Lanzhou Refinery, more than 3,000 construction workers gathered from all over the country are carrying out earthwork and installation work intensely. On the crisscrossing traffic lines within the factory area, vehicles carrying equipment are running back and forth; tall cranes are making a low roar, hoisting prefabricated large reinforced concrete components; under the workers' welding torches, blue sparks are flashing on oil tanks and pipelines.

Since the Lanzhou Refinery officially started construction in April this year, it has now completed projects such as the administrative office building. Four buildings have already been completed for the warehouse complex for storing raw materials. The foundation of the huge machine repair factory building project has been laid, and the large components needed for the building are being prefabricated on site. Installation work has also begun one after another. Half of the machines have been installed for the first unit where crude oil is processed after entering the factory—the electric desalting and dewatering unit. More than one hundred tall oil tanks in the oil tank area stand neatly in the building complex. Since June, pipeline prefabrication work has consistently exceeded the plan, and pipeline workers are rapidly laying pipes one by one along the pipe trenches.

Unity and Mutual Assistance to Improve Technology

The employees building the refinery come from all over the country. No matter where they come from, everyone has a common belief—to unite and build the refinery together. Therefore, touching examples of friendship, mutual assistance, and family-like affection are constantly emerging on the construction site.

The asphalt mixing team of the First Engineering Office of the Lanzhou Construction General Company has a total of thirty-eight workers, eighteen of whom come from Harbin City. They are all technicians with many years of experience. Among the other twenty workers from Shanghai, some used to be vendors, and some used to be temporary workers. These people, who speak different languages, have different living habits, and different technical levels, quickly signed apprenticeship contracts. The technicians led the ordinary workers in operation, explaining the operating procedures to them at the same time.

Because they are so united, the ordinary workers' skills have improved rapidly. Currently, more than a dozen ordinary workers have improved to the technical level of third-grade workers.

A Health Station on the Construction Site

The leaders of the refinery construction site have set up many welfare facilities for the employees.

Behind the machine repair factory construction site, there is a newly completed building. The doors and windows have not yet been installed, and the walls have not been plastered, but three medical personnel have already moved in to provide outpatient and emergency services. This is the health station of the Second Section of the First Engineering Office.

This health station is very simple. It is a large room with an examination bed, a medicine cabinet, and three desks. But it has solved big problems for the nearby earthwork workers, welding workers, and plumbing workers. It is very convenient for patients to see a doctor here. They do not need to ask for leave. They only need to take a few steps during their work break. There is no need to line up for registration here; they can see a doctor as soon as they arrive. After the examination, the doctor can turn around and take the required medicine from the medicine cabinet and give it to the patient, which takes only a few minutes. The medical staff of the health station also use their spare time to carry out health and safety supervision work. They inspect the environmental sanitation of the construction site, the workers' water, and the workers' construction conditions, and make suggestions to the administrative leaders when problems are found.

At the construction site of this huge modern factory, the employees are working happily and living happily. They are all determined to build this factory, which the country urgently needs, in the shortest possible time.

    建设中的兰州炼油厂
    燕树桂
    我国第一个现代化的大型石油加工厂——兰州炼油厂正在紧张施工中。
    这座工厂的全套设计和主要设备，都是由苏联供给的。根据设计要求，石油加工的整个操作过程，都将是高度机械化的，全厂的自动控制和指示仪表就有七千多件。由于设备都是现代化的，处理的原油数量很大，原油利用率很高。商品品种也很齐全，包括各种燃料用油和润滑油。
    紧张繁忙的工地
    在兰州炼油厂的工地上，由祖国各地调集来的三千多名建筑工人，正在紧张地进行着土方工程和安装工程。厂区内纵横交错的交通线上，载运器材的车辆往来奔驰；高大的起重机，发出低沉的轰鸣，吊装着预制好的大型钢筋混凝土构件；工人们的电焊钳子下，油罐和油管上闪动着蓝色的火花。
    兰州炼油厂从今年4月间正式动工以来，现在已经完成了行政办公大楼等工程。贮存原材料的仓库群，已经有四幢建筑物落成。巨大的机修厂厂房工程，已经打好基础，建筑物上需要的大型构件正在就地预制。安装工程也已经陆续开始。原油进厂后进行加工的第一个装置——电机脱盐脱水装置，有一半机器已经安装完毕。油罐区一百多个高大的油罐，整齐地矗立在建筑群中。管线预制工作，6月份以来一直超额完成计划，管道工人正沿着管沟一根接一根地急速向前敷设。
    团结互助提高技术
    建设炼油厂的职工，来自祖国各地。不管他们是从哪里来的，大家都有一个共同的信念——团结一致，共同建设炼油厂。因此，在工地上就不断出现了友爱互助亲如家人的光辉事例。
    兰州建筑总公司第一工程处沥青混合作业队共有三十八个工人，其中十八个人来自哈尔滨市，他们都是工作多年的技工。另外来自上海的二十个工人中，有的过去是作小贩的，有的过去是作临时工的。这些语言不同、生活习惯不同、技术水平不同的人之间，很快订了师徒合同。由技工带着普通工一面操作，一面向他们讲解操作规程。
    由于他们团结得很好，普通工人的技术提高得很快，目前已经有十多个普通工提高到三级工的技术水平了。
    工地上的保健站
    炼油厂工地的领导方面为职工们设置了不少福利设施。
    在机修厂工地的后面，有一所刚落成的建筑物，门窗还没有安上，墙壁也没有粉刷，三个医务人员已经搬进去，在这儿进行门诊和急救工作。这便是第一工程处第二工段的保健站。
    这个保健站很简单，一大间房子，里面摆着一张诊察床，一个药橱子，三张办公桌。但是却为附近的土方工人、电焊工人、水暖工人解决了很大问题。患者到这里看病，非常方便，用不着请假，只需要利用工作休息的时间，走动几步便到了。这里不用排队挂号，随到随看。看过以后，医生转过身去就可以从药橱里取出需要的药交给患者，前后不过几分钟的时间。保健站的医务人员，还利用业余时间展开卫生安全监督工作。对工地的环境卫生、工人用水、工人施工条件等进行检查，发现问题即向行政领导上提出建议。
    在这座巨大的现代化工厂的工地上，职工们愉快地工作着，愉快地生活着。他们都决心用最短的时间，建成这座国家急需的工厂。
