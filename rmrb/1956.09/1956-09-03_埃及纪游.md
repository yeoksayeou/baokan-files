Travelogue of Egypt

(XIII) A Red Rose in the Desert

According to the plan, the Liberation Province will consist of hundreds of villages. Two new villages have already been built, each with a management committee that governs more than two hundred households. The villages are named after Egyptian patriotic martyrs. The first village is named Umm Sabba, who was a rural young woman; the second village is named Omar Chahin, who was a student at the Egyptian University. These two young people participated in the anti-British guerrilla warfare in the Suez Canal Zone in 1951 and gave their precious lives for their country.

From many perspectives, the management style of the Liberation Province is advanced for Egypt. However, on Egypt's more than six million acres of cultivated land, a backward economic form still predominates. The old Egyptian countryside was characterized by extremely unreasonable feudal relations of production. The agricultural population of Egypt is about fifteen million, accounting for about 70% of the country's total population. However, landlords and rich peasants, who account for about 6% of the rural population, occupy more than 60% of all cultivated land; while peasants, who account for more than 90% of the rural population, own less than 40% of all cultivated land. The long-term rule of colonialism and the feudal dynasty has meant that the vast majority of peasants still use the production tools that their ancestors used centuries ago. They live in simple houses, and the scourge of bilharzia severely attacks the vast working peasants in the countryside. This situation cannot but greatly hinder the development of agricultural productivity in Egypt.

Since the establishment of the Republic of Egypt, the Egyptian government, while paying attention to the construction of the Liberation Province, has also paid attention to the development of agricultural productivity throughout Egypt. In September 1952, the government of the Republic of Egypt promulgated a land reform decree. The decree stipulated that each landlord shall not possess more than two hundred acres of land, and his son can only keep fifty acres, limited to two sons. That is to say, each landlord family can keep a maximum of three hundred acres of land. The surplus land is purchased by the government and then resold to the peasants. Now the Egyptian government has transferred some land to the peasants, and has also organized some production cooperatives in the countryside.

Since the establishment of the Liberation Province, Egyptian national leaders have often mentioned that they intend to promote the agricultural management methods of the Liberation Province. Therefore, a "training center" has been established in the Liberation Province to absorb some rural laborers for training. According to Egyptian friends, men receive technical training in driving machines and farming, while women receive training in embroidery and handicrafts, etc. (To be continued) (Attached photo)

    埃及纪游

    （十三）沙漠上的一朵红玫瑰
    按照计划，解放省将由数百个村落组成。现在已建设了两个新村，每村有一个管理委员会，管辖二百多个农户。村子是以埃及爱国志士的名字命名的。第一个村的名字是奥姆·萨巴，她是一个农村女青年；第二个村的名字是奥马·查欣，他是埃及大学的学生。这两个青年在1951年间参加了苏彝士运河区的抗英游击战争，而为自己的祖国献出了宝贵的生命。
    从许多方面看来，解放省的经营方式在埃及来说是先进的。但是在埃及六百多万埃亩的耕地上，主要的还是一种落后的经济形态。旧日的埃及农村存在着极不合理的封建生产关系。埃及的农业人口约为一千五百万，约占全国人口的70％。但是占农村人口6％左右的地主和富农占有全部耕地60％以上；而占农村人口90％以上的农民所有的土地还不到全部耕地的40％。长期的殖民主义和封建皇朝的统治，使广大农民还使用着他们的祖先多少世纪以前使用的生产工具。他们居住着简陋的房屋，吸血虫病的灾害严重地袭击着乡村中的广大的劳动农民。这种情况就不能不大大地束缚了埃及农业生产力的发展。
    埃及共和国建立以后，埃及政府在注意到建设解放省的同时，也已注意到了全埃及农业生产力的发展。1952年9月，埃及共和国政府就颁布了一个土地改革法令。法令规定，每个地主不得占有超过二百埃亩的土地，他的儿子只能保持五十埃亩，以两个儿子为限。也就是说，每户地主最多只能保持三百埃亩的土地。多余的土地由政府征购，然后再转卖给农民。现在埃及政府已把一部分土地转让给了农民，并且在农村还组织了一些生产合作社组织。
    解放省建立以后，埃及的国家领导人员经常提到，他们打算把解放省的农业经营方式推广。因此，在解放省建立了一个“训练中心”，吸收一些农村的劳动者来接受训练。据埃及朋友介绍说，男的接受驾驶机器及农田耕作等的技术训练，女的接受刺绣和手工艺等等的训练。（下）（附图片）
