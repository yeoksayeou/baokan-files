    In the Hometowns of Overseas Chinese
    Zhangzhou Building Overseas Chinese New Village
    Zhangzhou City, Fujian Province, is building a new village for overseas Chinese. The construction of the Overseas Chinese New Village was initiated in July last year by Mr. Lin Kaide and Mr. Cai Wucai, returned overseas Chinese from Indonesia. The Zhangzhou Municipal People's Committee, Real Estate Company, Construction Company, and other units have given great support to this matter. The design and drafting work has been completed; the location is selected at Xiguchi.
    The location of the new village is very good, surrounded by parks, markets, schools, and hospitals. The Xiguchi pond, with an area of more than 4,000 square meters, can also be used for fish farming. The new village has an area of more than 80,000 square meters and plans to build 71 residential buildings. Longan, peach, banana, loquat, and palm trees will be planted around the houses in the new village.
    The Zhangzhou Municipal People's Committee has made many preferential regulations for overseas Chinese building houses in the new village. For example, when using state-owned land, the government will allocate it for long-term use, and the rent will be calculated at 80% of the current land price. New houses will be exempt from real estate tax for five years. According to the actual situation, schools, sports fields, supply and marketing cooperatives will also be set up in the new village, and street offices will be established.
    The architectural structure of the houses is divided into four types: A, B, C, and D, each with different patterns for overseas Chinese and their relatives to choose from. At present, many returned overseas Chinese and their relatives in Zhangzhou, Hua'an, Longxi, and other counties and cities have applied for registration. Overseas Chinese relatives in Zhangpu, Haicheng, and other counties have also written letters to request drawings in preparation for registration. Overseas Chinese abroad have also expressed concern about the new village and often write letters to inquire about the progress of construction. The first batch of buildings in the new village is expected to be completed before October 1 this year. The entire new village will be completed in a maximum of three years.
    Guangzhou Overseas Chinese Sugar Factory Construction
    The Guangzhou Overseas Chinese Sugar Factory is under intense construction. All the projects can be completed in the fourth quarter of next year, and production is scheduled to begin at the end of next year.
    The entire production process of this factory is mechanized. The daily cane crushing capacity reaches 2,000 tons, and it can produce 240 tons of white sugar that meets international standards. The distribution of all factory buildings surrounds the Songzhougang foot of Songxi Township in the northwest of Guangzhou. In addition to factory buildings and dormitories, there are also cooperatives, medical clinics, and other buildings. The total area of the factory is nearly 170,000 square meters.
    Most Children of Overseas Chinese Relatives Enrolled in Schools
    In Jinjiang County, Fujian Province, the famous hometown of overseas Chinese, most of the children of overseas Chinese relatives who applied for high school and junior high school in Shishi Town this year have been enrolled, and a few who were not admitted have also been properly placed.
    This year, 96 children of overseas Chinese relatives in the town applied for high school and junior high school, and 70 were admitted. All nine graduating overseas Chinese children from Kuanren Street were admitted. Cai Congmin, an overseas Chinese relative from Xinhua Street, graduated from junior high school the year before last and studied at home. This time, he was also admitted to the exam. Of the 26 who were not admitted, 17 were introduced to the remedial classes of Jinjiang Overseas Chinese Middle School, and 9 were introduced to work as teachers in private schools. Now they have all happily embarked on learning and working posts.
    Increased Income for Overseas Chinese Dependents
    The Tangxi Advanced Agricultural Cooperative in Xiaohu, Yongchun County, Fujian Province, arranged the labor of overseas Chinese relatives and returned overseas Chinese members properly according to their specialties, so that they increased their income like the peasants.
    The overseas Chinese relatives in this society are good at needlework, and the cooperative specially organized a tailoring sideline group for them, with a total monthly income of more than 170 yuan. Wang Shuyuan has high skills and earns a monthly salary of 39.9 yuan. Lin Shenli takes care of children and sews clothes at home, and can still earn more than 17 yuan per month. The Chen Qian family, a family of eight overseas Chinese households in the Seventh Production Team, were all old, young, and weak. Last summer, they only harvested more than 900 kilograms of dry grain, and were still short of 200 kilograms of grain. This year, the cooperative distributed six cows to his family and allowed the women to participate in light labor. This summer harvest is expected to distribute more than 1,700 kilograms of grain, increasing income by nearly one time.
    Liuchuan Township Construction
    The three-year construction plan of Liuchuan Township, a major overseas Chinese hometown in Longxi County, Fujian Province, is being implemented smoothly. At present, overseas Chinese and their relatives have invested 5,000 yuan to expand a rice mill with a daily milling capacity of 8,000 kilograms of grain and a pigsty. In addition, more than 20 sideline workshops and cultural undertakings will also be prepared for construction.
    The planned construction projects are all promising sideline industries with less investment and greater returns, which can solve the employment problems of overseas Chinese relatives, returned overseas Chinese, and farmers who lack labor. The Dumentou Rice Mill in this township has started production after being repaired and expanded, and the problem of grain processing in the township has been solved since then. The newly built pigsty by the road has already raised piglets, and two more will be built, which can raise more than 500 pigs. Four fish farms have also been established, releasing nearly 10,000 fish fry; more than 20 other large and small ponds will also be stocked with fish. The township will also establish seven duck houses, chicken farms, and goose farms within three years, raising thousands of chickens, ducks, and geese. Six cowsheds and sheepfolds will be built on the hillside. After the construction of two sewing factories with thirty-six sewing machines, the members will not have to leave the township to make clothes. In addition, six castor silkworm breeding farms will be developed. These sidelines are all under the unified management of the sideline group of the agricultural cooperative, and the funds are raised by the overseas Chinese relatives work committee. The plan also pays attention to the cultural life of the people in the overseas Chinese hometown, and decided to add two primary schools, open four new basketball and volleyball courts, and set up a club (兼办托儿所) and a medical clinic each, and establish a troupe.
    Overseas Chinese Service Building Commences Construction
    The construction of the Xiamen Overseas Chinese Service Building, which is preparing to receive overseas Chinese entering and leaving the country, has begun. On August 15th and 16th, the staff of Fujian Provincial Second Construction Engineering Company had planted the inner and outer distance signs of the project on the ground; Xiamen Transportation Company's light green trucks, full of building materials such as red bricks, rushed to the construction site.
    The building has three floors, with more than eighty guest rooms, as well as spacious dining halls, clubs, and shower and bath facilities. A wide garden will also be opened behind the building for visitors to walk and rest.
    Crops Grow on the Beach
    Yuan Lin, Zhao Chun
    Not long ago, I visited the public-private joint venture Fuqing County Haikou Overseas Chinese Machinery Farm in Fujian Province.
    On the way to the farm, you can see a row of white buildings in the farm from a distance. These houses have been built recently, including office buildings, dormitories, dining halls, tractor rooms, warehouses, etc. The farm is full of lush crops. When I came here last year, many places in this area were still desolate seas, covered with dense weeds, but now they are full of good crops, and even the places where salt used to be dried are growing sweet potatoes. Director Yang of the farm said: "Although the water quality here is very salty and irrigation is inconvenient, we have selected good varieties that are resistant to salt and drought, and the crops still grow very well."
    We walked into the office hall, and Director Yang took out the production plan for me and told me that they planned to reclaim 1,500 mu of wasteland in the first phase, and the result was 1,837 mu. In addition, we will also raise 200 pigs, hundreds of chickens and ducks, and plant 300 citrus trees. After the completion of this plan, this year we will be able to produce more than 780,000 jin of grain for the country. "This plan can be realized," Director Yang said with certainty. "The climate here is mild, and crops can be harvested four times a year. We will use seaweed, weeds, and fine sand to improve the soil so that it can be suitable for the large-scale planting of cash crops.
    Director Yang also took me to visit the tractor room. There is a tractor, a four-furrow plow, a hanging plow, a twenty-four-row seeder, a forty-one-piece disc harrow, and a four-group tine harrow. A Polish chain-track 35K tractor will also be delivered soon.
    "The development prospects of our farm are very broad." Director Yang said. "The farm can raise a large number of fish, pigs, cattle, sheep, chickens, ducks, etc. After improving the soil, the land here can grow a large amount of sugar cane. We will also plant a large number of trees on the farm. At that time, the farm will be a paradise with green trees, abundant grains, and herds of pigs and sheep." (Attached picture)
    Huajian Jute Textile Factory is a jute bag weaving factory established in Guangzhou by the public-private joint venture Overseas Chinese Investment Company. In the two years since the establishment of the factory, the quality of products has continued to improve, and the number of employees has increased from more than 200 to 1,147.

    在华侨的家乡
    漳州兴建华侨新村
    福建省漳州市正在兴建华侨新村。华侨新村的兴建，是去年7月间由印度尼西亚归侨林开德、蔡梧材两先生倡议的，漳州市人民委员会、房地产公司、建筑公司等单位对这件事情给了很大支持。现在设计、绘图工作已经完成；地点选择在西姑池。
    新村的地点很好，四周有公园、市场、学校、医院，四千多平方公尺的西姑池内还可以养鱼。新村的面积约有八万多平方公尺，计划建筑住宅七十一幢。新村房屋四周将培植龙眼、桃、香蕉、枇杷和棕树等。
    漳州市人民委员会对在新村内建筑房屋的华侨做了许多优待规定，例如动用国有土地的，由政府拨给长期使用，租金依照现在地价打八折计算；新建房屋免征房地产税五年。根据实际情况，新村内还将设立学校、体育场、供销合作社，以及建立街道办事处。
    房屋的建筑结构形式分为甲乙丙丁四种，每种又有不同的图样，由华侨侨眷自行选择。目前漳州、华安、龙溪等县市的归侨侨眷申请登记的已有不少，漳浦、海澄等县的华侨侨眷也写信讨取图样，准备登记。海外华侨对新村也表示关怀，常写信询问动工情况。新村的第一批建筑，估计在今年十月一日以前可以完成，新村全部建成，最多需要三年时间。
    广州华侨糖厂施工
    广州华侨糖厂正在紧张地进行施工。明年第四季度全部工程可以完成，并准备在明年年底投入生产。
    这个厂全部生产过程都是机械化的。每天的榨蔗量达二千吨，可以出产二百四十吨质量符合国际标准的白砂糖。全厂建筑物的分布，是环绕着广州市西北部松溪乡松洲岗脚，除了厂房、宿舍以外，还有合作社、医疗所等建筑。全厂用地面积近十七万平方公尺。
    侨属子女大部升学
    福建省晋江县著名侨乡石狮镇今年投考高中、初中的侨属子女，绝大部分已经升学，少数没有被录取的也得到了妥善安置。
    今年全镇投考高中、初中的侨属子女九十六人，被录取的有七十人；宽仁街应届毕业的华侨子女九人，全部录取。新华街侨属蔡聪敏，前年初中毕业以后，在家自修，这次投考也被录取了。没有录取的二十六人，其中十七人被介绍到晋江华侨中学补习班补习，九人被介绍做民校教师等工作。现在他们都愉快地走上学习和工作岗位。
    侨眷社员收入增加
    福建省永春县小岵侨乡塘溪高级农业合作社，按照侨眷、归侨社员的特长，妥善安排他们的劳动，使他们同农民一样增加了收入。
    这个社里的侨眷擅长针线活，合作社特为她们组织一个裁缝副业小组，全月收入达一百七十多元。王淑媛技术较高，月得工资三十九元九分；林慎理在家看小孩兼缝衣服，每月还能得十七元多。第七生产队侨户陈歉一家八口，都是老幼和身体衰弱的，去年夏季仅收干谷九百多斤，还缺口粮两百斤；今年合作社分配他家饲牛六头，并且让妇女半劳动力参加轻微劳动，这次夏收预分得到一千七百多斤粮食，增加收入近一倍。
    流传乡的建设
    福建省龙溪县主要侨乡流传乡的三年建设规划，正在顺利执行。目前，华侨、侨眷已经投资五千元，扩建一座日碾粮食八千斤的碾米厂和一座猪舍；另外二十多处副业工场和文化事业也将陆续筹建。
    规划中的建设项目都是有发展前途的副业，投资少、收益大，又能解决缺乏劳动力的侨眷、归侨和农民的工作问题。这个乡陡门头碾米厂经过修理扩建以后，已经开始生产，全乡粮食加工问题从此得到解决。公路旁新建的猪舍已经养上小猪，另外两座也将建立，可以养猪五百多头。四个养鱼场也建立起来，放下近万尾鱼苗；另外二十多个大小池塘也要放鱼。全乡在三年内还要建立鸭母寮、养鸡场、养鹅场七所，放养数千只鸡、鸭、鹅。山坡上要盖起六座牛舍、羊舍。拥有三十六架缝纫机的两所缝纫工场建成以后，社员制衣就不必出乡。此外还要发展六个蓖麻蚕养殖场。这些副业都交农业社副业组统一管理，由侨属工作委员会筹集资金。规划还注意了侨乡人民的文化生活，决定增办两所初级小学，新辟篮、排球场四处，设俱乐部（兼办托儿所）和医疗所各一所，并成立一个剧团。
    华侨服务社大楼动工
    准备接待出国入国华侨的厦门市华侨服务社大楼已经开始动工兴建。8月15、16两天，福建省第二建筑工程公司的人员，已把工程内外间隔距离的标志插在地面上；厦门市搬运公司浅绿色的大卡车，满载着红砖等建筑材料，奔向工地。
    这座大楼计有三层，共八十多间客房，还有宽敞的膳厅、俱乐部以及淋浴、盆浴等设备。大楼的后面还将开辟宽阔的花园，供旅客散步、休息。
    海滩上长起庄稼
  　远霖　肇椿
    不久以前，我访问了福建省公私合营福清县海口华侨机械农场。
    在去农场的路上，远远地就可以看到农场的一列白色的建筑物。这些房子是最近才修建起来的，其中包括了办公大楼、宿舍、饭厅、拖拉机房、仓库等。农场里长满了茂盛的庄稼。去年我到这里的时候，这一带许多地方还是荒凉的海，长着密密麻麻的杂草，现在却长满了一片好庄稼，连过去晒盐的地方，也长着地瓜。农场的杨场长说：“虽然这地方的水质很咸，灌溉不便，但我们选用了耐咸耐旱的良种，作物仍然长得很好。”
    我们走进了办公厅，杨场长把生产计划拿给我看，并且告诉我，他们计划第一期垦荒一千五百亩，结果完成一千八百三十七亩。此外还要养猪二百口，鸡鸭数百只，栽种柑桔三百株。这个计划完成以后，今年就能为国家生产粮食七十八万多斤。“这个计划是能实现的，”杨场长肯定地说。“这里气候温和，作物可以一年四熟。我们将利用海藻、杂草、细沙改良土壤，使它能适合大量种植经济作物。
    杨场长又带我到拖拉机房参观。那里有拖拉机一台，四铧犁、悬挂吊犁各一架，二十四行播种机一台，四十一片圆盘耙一台，四组钉齿耙一台，马拉农具二套。不久还将运来一台波兰链轨式35K拖拉机。
    “我们农场的发展前途是非常广阔的。”杨场长说。“农场可以大量养殖鱼类和猪、牛、羊、鸡、鸭等。经过改良土壤以后，这里的土地可以大量种植甘蔗。我们还要在农场里大量植树。到那时，农场就会是绿树成荫，五谷满仓，猪羊成群的乐园了。”（附图片）
