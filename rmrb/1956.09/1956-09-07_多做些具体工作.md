    Do More Specific Work
    Cong Lin
    The Party has repeatedly taught us: "Leading cadres must do it themselves." From my daily work, I deeply realize that this sentence is an important part of doing a good job. If you don't believe me, here's an example.
    In May 1955, Shenyang City sent a group of workers abroad. Some of these workers were led by the director of the First Industry Bureau of the Liaoning Provincial Department of Industry. Because the leadership did not personally participate in the preparation work, most of the preparation work had not been completed two days before departure: the exit permits had not been completed; the membership relations had not been handled; and the wages of some workers during their working period had not been paid. Seeing that departure was imminent, but a pile of problems had not been solved, the director personally took charge, and at the same time temporarily transferred many cadres. There were more than ten bureau and department-level cadres from various units who went to inspect and assist in the work. However, because these cadres did not participate in the actual work, they only criticized here and pointed there, and as a result, not many practical problems were solved. The situation was different for another group of people led by the Provincial Department of Construction. The main thing was that the director of the department personally participated in various specific tasks. Therefore, he understood the various links in the work very clearly. He knew very well which parts were done well, which parts were not done well, where problems might occur, and how to prevent them, etc. He was able to plan and arrange the work step by step very clearly. Therefore, everything was well prepared before their departure.
    At present, a common shortcoming in our work, especially in the work of government offices, is that leading cadres do not do specific work. In many government offices, as long as they are cadres above the section chief level, they do not have to do specific work. Whenever work plans are determined and work tasks are assigned, it is rare to plan for leading cadres to be a force for completing specific tasks. The work of many leading cadres is mostly to preside over meetings, listen to reports, and approve documents. In this way, leading cadres cannot understand the vivid situation in the work, and of course, the problems that occur in the work cannot be properly solved.
    Originally, the main responsibility of leading cadres is to correctly grasp policies on the basis of being familiar with cadres and being familiar with the business, and to rely on their own exemplary actions to organize leading cadres to continuously improve their work, so as to ensure the completion of tasks ahead of schedule and exceeding the target. But to do this, it is impossible not to participate in specific work, because the problems in the work do not arise in the minds of the leaders in advance, or at meetings, but exist in the actual work.
    However, there is often a lot of work in a department, and of course, leading cadres cannot participate in everything. General work can be led through planning summaries and inspection work. Leading cadres must personally participate in key tasks. Because key tasks are often related to other general tasks, often after a task is done well, not only are cadres trained, but other tasks are also driven.

    多做些具体工作
    从林
    党一再教导我们：“领导干部必须亲自动手，”我从日常工作中，深深体验到这句话是做好工作的重要环节，不信，有例为证。
    1955年5月，沈阳市曾输送了一部分出国工人，其中有一部分工人是由辽宁省工业厅第一工业局局长领导的，由于领导上没有亲自参加准备工作，所以到临出发的前两天，大部分准备工作尚未做好：出国证件没有搞好；会员关系没有办理；一部分工人在工作时期的工资还没有发下来。眼看快出发了，而问题一大堆没有解决，局长才亲自出马，同时临时又抽调了很多干部，仅仅各单位前去检查和协助工作的局处长级的干部就有十多名，可是由于这些干部也不参加实际工作，只是这里批评批评，那里指点指点，结果还是解决不了多少实际问题。另外一部分人是省建设厅领导的，情况就不同了，主要的是厅长亲自参加了各项具体工作，因此他对工作中的各个环节都了解得很清楚，那里做得好，那里做得不好，那个地方可能发生问题，以及应当如何去防止等等，都能做到事先心中有数，就能够很清醒的按步骤来计划和布置工作，因此，他们在出发前，一切都准备得很好。
    目前在我们的工作中，特别是机关工作中，带有普遍性的一个缺点，就是领导干部不做具体工作。很多机关，只要是科长以上的干部，就可以不做具体工作，每当确定工作计划和分配工作任务时，很少把领导干部也当做完成具体工作的一份力量来筹划，许多领导干部的工作多半是主持主持会议，听听汇报，批批文件。这样，领导干部就不可能了解工作中生动的情况，当然工作中发生的问题，就更不能恰如其分的加以解决了。
    本来领导干部的主要责任，就是在熟悉干部和熟悉业务的基础上，正确地掌握政策，依靠自己的模范行动，组织领导干部不断的改进工作，以此保证提前和超额完成任务。但是要做到这一点，不参加具体工作是不可能的，因为工作中的问题，不是事先就生在领导者的脑子里，或者是会议上，而是存在在实际工作中。
    不过，一个部门的工作往往很多，领导干部当然不可能样样都参加，一般工作可以通过计划总结和检查工作来领导。重点工作却必须领导干部亲自参加。因为重点工作常常是和其他一般工作有连带关系的，往往在一件工作上做好了以后，不仅培养了干部，而且把别的工作也带动起来了。
