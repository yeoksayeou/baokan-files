Xinhua News Agency, Yanji: The visiting group from thirteen provinces, cities, and districts in northern China, after visiting the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture, believes that the experience of this famous northern rice-growing area should be promoted.

This visiting group was organized by the Ministry of Agriculture and included 159 people, including agricultural cooperative representatives, agricultural technicians, agricultural educators, and agricultural administrative leaders from thirteen provinces, cities, and districts north of the Yangtze River. During their nine days in the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture, they visited four well-known local agricultural cooperatives and comprehensively investigated and studied rice cultivation experiences and experiences in developing water sources for paddy fields.

The Yanbian area currently has more than 44,000 hectares of paddy fields, exceeding the highest area before liberation by 20%. Last year, the average yield per hectare reached 7,420 jin. The Kaishantun Agricultural Cooperative in Yanji County even created a high yield record of 20,118 jin per hectare last year.

The head of the visiting group said that Yanbian's experience proves that rice can not only be widely grown in the north, but also increase the yield per unit area. The delegation highly praised Yanbian's rice cultivation technology. The "dry bed," "cold bed," and "water bed" seedling raising methods are achievements made by Yanbian Korean farmers through continuous research and repeated failures over the years. Using these methods in the north can cultivate strong seedlings, transplant them early, and ensure increased production. The "dry bed" seedling raising method is also suitable for double-cropping rice. According to the different varieties and characteristics of rice, Yanbian widely promoted intensive planting experiences such as "single row," "small triangle," and "compound," which reasonably increased the number of holes per unit area, and there was no lodging of rice. The experience of Yanbian farmers in widely applying farm manure to cultivate rice has also attracted the attention of representatives from various provinces and cities.

During the visit, the representatives listened to the investigation report of Soviet agricultural expert Buniak and exchanged rice cultivation experiences from various parts of northern China.

    农业部组织十三个省市区参观团
    学习延边水稻栽培经验
    据新华社延吉电　北方十三个省、市、区水稻参观团在延边朝鲜族自治州参观后，认为应该把这个北方著名水稻栽培区的经验推广。
    这次参观团是由农业部组织的，包括长江以北十三个省市区的农业社代表、农业技术干部、农业教育工作者和农业行政领导干部等一百五十九人。他们在延边朝鲜族自治州的九天期间，访问了当地著名的四个农业社，较全面地考察和学习了水稻栽培经验和挖掘水源开发稻田等经验。
    延边地区现有稻田四万四千多公顷，超过解放前最高面积20％，去年每公顷平均产量达到了七千四百二十市斤，延吉县开山镇农业社去年还创造了每公顷二万零一百一十八市斤的高额丰产纪录。
    参观团的团长说，延边的经验，证明在北方不但可以普遍种植水稻，而且，也能够提高水稻单位面积产量。代表团对延边地区水稻栽培技术给予很高评价。“陆床”“冷床”“水床”育苗方法都是延边朝鲜族农民经过几年来连续不断的钻研和从多次失败中取得的成就。用这些方法在北方能够培育壮苗、提早插秧，保证增产，“陆床”育苗法还适用于双季稻。延边地区根据稻子的不同品种不同特性，广泛推行了“单行”“小三角”“复式”等密植经验，结果合理提高了单位面积的穴数，水稻还没有倒伏现象。延边农民广泛大量应用农家肥料栽培水稻的经验，也引起了各省、市代表们的注意。
    在参观期间代表们曾经听取了苏联农业专家布尼亚克的考察报告，交流了北方各地水稻栽培经验。
