Xinhua News Agency, September 16th: Deng Xiaoping, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, delivered a "Report on the Revision of the Party Constitution" to the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China today on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.

Deng Xiaoping first pointed out that since the Seventh National Congress of the Party, a series of brilliant victories have irrefutably proved the correctness of the political line stipulated by the Seventh National Congress and the political leadership of the Party Central Committee after the Seventh Congress; it has also irrefutably proved the correctness of the organizational line stipulated by the Seventh National Congress and the organizational leadership of the Party Central Committee after the Seventh Congress.

He said that the draft Party Constitution now submitted to the Congress for discussion has been formed through discussions and multiple revisions by Party organizations in various regions. Compared with the Party Constitution passed by the Seventh Congress, this draft does not have any fundamental differences in principle, but it has undergone many changes in specific content, including some changes of a principled nature.

Deng Xiaoping then analyzed the conditions under which this revision of the Party Constitution was based. He said that compared with the time of the Seventh Congress, the situation in our country is now completely different, and the situation of the Party has also undergone great changes. The Communist Party of China is already the ruling party. The number of party members has increased eightfold. The position of the ruling party puts the Party in the face of new tests. The danger of being out of touch with reality and out of touch with the masses is not less but greater for Party organizations and Party members than in the past. The position of the ruling party also easily breeds a sense of pride and complacency among Communist Party members. In response to this situation, the Party must constantly pay attention to carrying out the struggle against subjectivism, bureaucratism, and sectarianism, and constantly guard against the danger of being out of touch with reality and out of touch with the masses. He said that it is very clear that the enormous changes in the state and the Party place higher, not lower, demands on our Party, and higher, not lower, demands on Communist Party members. The draft Party Constitution has made appropriate revisions to the original Party Constitution based on these new situations and new requirements. In addition, the draft Party Constitution also appropriately reflects the many new experiences that the Party has accumulated in various fields since the Seventh Congress.

After analyzing the conditions under which the Party Constitution was revised, Deng Xiaoping focused on explaining the issues in the draft Party Constitution regarding the Party's mass line, the Party's democratic centralism, the Party's unity and unification, and raising the standards of Party members and guaranteeing their rights.

Regarding the Party's mass line, Deng Xiaoping said that the general program of the draft Party Constitution emphasizes that the Party must constantly carry forward the tradition of the mass line in the Party's work, and points out that this task has even greater significance because the Party has become the ruling party. Deng Xiaoping summarized what the mass line in the Party's work is, elaborated on the extremely profound theoretical and practical significance of the Party's mass line, and reviewed the great victories the Party has achieved since the Seventh Congress due to the implementation of the mass line. Deng Xiaoping said that we must let the whole Party remember: if correctly implementing the mass line brings us success, then violating the mass line will inevitably cause our work to suffer losses and the interests of the people to suffer losses. He pointed out that at present, various bureaucratic tendencies are growing among many staff members of Party organizations and state organs. The existence of these phenomena shows that the mass line in the Party's work has not yet been fully implemented within the Party. In order to continue implementing the Party's mass line, Deng Xiaoping put forward a series of specific measures in the report. These are: focusing on education on the Party's mass line; systematically improving the working methods of leading organs at all levels to prevent the danger of bureaucratization of leading organs; improving the Party's and the state's democratic life; strengthening the Party's and the state's supervisory work; and adopting the method of mass criticism and self-criticism to conduct a work style rectification of all Party members every certain period, especially focusing on checking the implementation of the mass line. At the same time, he pointed out that in the struggle to implement the mass line and oppose bureaucratism, close cooperation with non-Party members and widely absorbing non-Party members to participate in this struggle is of great significance.

Regarding the Party's democratic centralism, Deng Xiaoping spoke about the Party's relationship between higher and lower levels and the collective leadership in Party organizations at all levels. He pointed out that the shortcomings in the Party's relationship between higher and lower levels, generally speaking, are mainly insufficient attention to developing the enthusiasm and creativity of lower-level organizations. In this regard, the draft Party Constitution has added provisions regarding the basic conditions of democratic centralism, the scope of authority of the central and local levels, higher and lower levels, and the discussion and implementation of policy issues. Deng Xiaoping said that in our Party, for a long time, it has been a tradition for the Party collectively, not individuals, to decide on major issues. In his report, he focused on elaborating on the Party Central Committee's decision on improving the Party Committee system made in September 1948. This decision pointed out that all important issues must be submitted to the Party Committee for discussion, and members attending the meeting should fully express their opinions, make clear decisions, and then implement them separately, and pointed out that collective leadership and individual responsibility should not be neglected. Deng Xiaoping said that according to the experience of recent years, the Central Committee has decided to implement the system of collective leadership of the Party Committee in all enterprises as well, that is, the factory director responsibility system or the manager responsibility system under the collective leadership of the Party Committee. Deng Xiaoping then emphasized that in terms of the Party's democratic life, the Party Central Committee has decided to adopt a fundamental reform in the draft Party Constitution, that is, to change the Party's national, provincial, and county-level congresses into permanent systems. According to the new system, the Party's most important decisions can be discussed through the congress held once a year. He said that this reform will inevitably lead to a major development of intra-Party democracy. Deng Xiaoping emphatically pointed out that the Party is a fighting organization, and all measures to develop intra-Party democracy are not intended to weaken the Party's necessary centralism, but to give it a strong and vibrant foundation. And collective leadership must also be combined with individual responsibility. Deng Xiaoping also talked about the role of leaders in the Party here.

Deng Xiaoping emphasized that the Party's unity and unification are one of the most important issues in the Party's construction. He said that in order to strengthen the unity and unification of its ranks, in order to correctly play its leading role and core role, the Party has waged a resolute struggle against various erroneous tendencies in the issue of the relationship between the Party and the state organs. Deng Xiaoping said that the most serious intra-Party struggle during the period from the Seventh Congress to the Eighth Congress was the struggle against the anti-Party alliance of Gao Gang and Rao Shushi. He pointed out that after this struggle, the Party's unity and unification have been greatly strengthened, the awareness of all Party comrades and the combat effectiveness of Party organizations have been greatly improved. The enemies of the Party and the people have gained nothing in this struggle. He said that the resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee to adopt a differentiated approach to the shortcomings and mistakes of Party members has been written into the general program of the draft Party Constitution. Practice has proved that adopting this approach is conducive to the Party's unity and the vigorous development of the Party's cause. Deng Xiaoping said that in order to maintain the Party's unity and unification on the basis of Marxism-Leninism, in order to help comrades overcome shortcomings and correct mistakes in a timely manner, it is necessary to greatly develop intra-Party criticism and self-criticism. He pointed out that encouraging and supporting criticism from below and prohibiting the suppression of criticism is of decisive significance for the development of criticism.

When talking about the provisions on Party members in the draft Party Constitution, Deng Xiaoping pointed out that the victory of the Party's cause, the increase in the responsibilities the Party bears to the people, and the increase in the Party's prestige among the people all require the Party to set higher standards for Party members. Striving to raise the standards of Party members is one of the important political tasks of the Party at present. Deng Xiaoping then explained some of the new provisions in the draft Party Constitution regarding the conditions for Party membership and the obligations of Party members. He said that the new provisions on the obligations of Party members indicate that the Party's requirements for Party members are even stricter. These provisions need to be widely and deeply educated among Party members and active elements preparing to join the Party. Deng Xiaoping said that while the Party is working hard to raise the standards of Party members, it must also pay attention to protecting and expanding the democratic rights of Party members. He pointed out that the draft Party Constitution stipulates that fully developing creativity in work is a right of Party members, which is of principled significance. This provision can not only greatly stimulate the vast number of Party members to fully concentrate the wisdom of the masses, use independent thinking, and solve problems realistically and creatively within the scope allowed by Party discipline, but also enable many leading personnel who are accustomed to sticking to conventions and accustomed to not respecting the creativity of Party members and the masses to learn to change their work style, thereby promoting the upsurge of intra-Party democracy. He said that the draft also specifically stipulates that infringing on the rights of Party members is a violation of Party discipline and should be given disciplinary action. This is a strong guarantee for the rights of Party members. In this part of the report, Deng Xiaoping also explained the important revisions made to the Party Constitution regarding rewards and punishments within the Party, and talked about the issue of Party cadres.

Deng Xiaoping then briefly explained some new provisions in the draft Party Constitution regarding the Party's organizational structure.

Deng Xiaoping finally said in the report that the Central Committee believes that the draft Party Constitution is suitable for the current situation and tasks of our Party. After the draft Party Constitution is discussed and approved by the Eighth National Congress of the Party, it will become a powerful weapon for further improving the Party's quality, expanding intra-Party democracy, promoting the political enthusiasm of Party members, improving the Party's organizational work, and strengthening the Party's unity, unification, and combat effectiveness.

### 在中国共产党第八次全国代表大会上  邓小平作关于修改党的章程的报告

    在中国共产党第八次全国代表大会上
    邓小平作关于修改党的章程的报告
    新华社16日讯　中国共产党中央政治局委员邓小平今天代表中国共产党中央委员会向中国共产党第八次全国代表大会作了“关于修改党的章程的报告”。
    邓小平首先指出，从党的第七次全国代表大会以来，一个接连一个的光辉的胜利，无可争辩地证明了党的第七次全国代表大会所规定的政治路线和七大以后党中央的政治领导的正确性；同时也无可争辩地证明了党的第七次全国代表大会所规定的组织路线和七大以后党中央的组织领导的正确性。
    他说，现在提请大会讨论的党章草案，是经过各地党的组织的讨论和多次修改而成的。这个草案，同第七次大会所通过的党章比较起来，并没有根本原则上的不同，但是，在具体内容上却有了很多的改变，其中包含一些带有原则性的改变。
    邓小平接着分析了这次修改党章所根据的条件。他说，同第七次大会的时候比较起来，现在我们国家的状况完全不同了，党的状况也有了很大的变化。中国共产党已经是执政的党。党员的数目增加了八倍。执政党的地位使党面临着新的考验。脱离实际和脱离群众的危险，对于党的组织和党员来说，不是比过去减少而是比过去增加了。执政党的地位还很容易在共产党员身上滋长着一种骄傲自满的情绪。针对着这种情况，党必须经常注意进行反对主观主义、官僚主义和宗派主义的斗争，经常警戒脱离实际和脱离群众的危险。他说，很显然的，国家和党的状况的巨大变化，对于我们党的要求是更高而不是更低了，对于共产党员的要求也是更高而不是更低了。党章草案就是根据这些新的情况和新的要求而对原有党章作了适当的修改。此外，党章草案同时也适当地反映了从第七次大会以来党在各方面积累的许多新的经验。
    在分析了修改党章所根据的条件以后，邓小平分别就党章草案中关于党的群众路线、关于党的民主集中制、关于党的团结和统一、关于提高党员的标准和保障党员的权利等方面的问题，着重地作了说明。
    关于党的群众路线，邓小平说，党章草案的总纲着重指出了党必须不断地发扬党的工作中的群众路线的传统，并且指出了这个任务由于党成了执政的党而有更加重大的意义。邓小平概括地说明了什么是党的工作中的群众路线，阐述了党的群众路线所具有的极深刻的理论意义和实际意义，并且回顾了党从第七次大会以来由于实行群众路线而得到的巨大胜利。邓小平说，我们要让全党记住：如果正确地实行群众路线使我们得到成功，那么，违背群众路线就一定要使我们的工作遭受损失，使人民的利益遭受损失。他指出，目前在党的组织和国家机关的许多工作人员中正在滋长着形形色色的官僚主义的倾向，这些现象的存在，说明党的工作中的群众路线还远没有在党内得到完全贯彻地执行。为了继续贯彻党的群众路线，邓小平在报告中提出了一系列具体的措施。这就是：着重进行党的群众路线的教育；有系统地改善各级领导机关的工作方法，防止领导机关官僚化的危险；健全党的和国家的民主生活；加强党的和国家的监察工作；采取群众性的批评和自我批评的方法，每隔一定时期对全体党员进行一次工作作风的整顿，特别着重检查群众路线的执行情况。同时他指出，在贯彻执行群众路线、反对官僚主义的斗争中，密切同党外人士的合作，广泛地吸收党外人士参加这一斗争，具有重大的意义。
    关于党的民主集中制，邓小平在报告中讲了党的上下级关系和各级党组织中的集体领导等问题。他指出，目前党的上下级关系中的缺点，从总的方面说来，主要地还是对于发扬下级组织的积极性创造性注意不足。在这方面，党章草案关于民主集中制的基本条件，关于中央和地方、上级和下级的职权范围问题，关于政策问题的讨论和决议的执行，都增加了规定。邓小平说，在我们党内，从长期以来，由党的集体而不由个人决定重大的问题，已经形成一个传统。他在报告中着重阐述了党中央在1948年9月作出的关于健全党委制的决定。这个决定指出，一切重要问题均须交党的委员会讨论，由到会委员充分发表意见，做出明确决定，然后分别执行，并且指出，集体领导和个人负责，二者不可偏废。邓小平说，根据最近几年的经验，中央已经决定在一切企业中同样实行党委集体领导的制度，也就是党委集体领导下的厂长负责制或经理负责制等等。邓小平接着强调指出，在党的民主生活方面，党中央委员会在党章草案中决定采取一项根本的改革，就是把党的全国的、省一级和县一级的代表大会都改作常任制。按照新的制度，党的最重要的决定都可以经过每年开会一次的代表大会讨论。他说，这种改革，必将使党内民主得到重大的发展。邓小平着重地指出，党是一个战斗的组织，一切发展党内民主的措施都不是为了削弱党的必需的集中，而是为了给它以强大的生气勃勃的基础。而集体领导，也必须同个人负责相结合。邓小平在这里还谈到了领袖对于党的作用。
    邓小平强调指出，党的团结和统一是党的建设的最重要问题之一。他说，党为了加强自己队伍的团结和统一，为了正确地发挥自己的领导作用和核心作用，曾经同在党和国家机关工作的关系问题上的各种错误的倾向，进行了坚决的斗争。邓小平说，在从第七次大会到第八次大会期间，最严重的党内斗争就是反对高岗、饶漱石反党联盟的斗争。他指出，经过这一斗争以后，党的团结和统一大大加强了，全党同志的觉悟和党的组织的战斗力大大提高了。党的和人民的敌人在这一斗争中什么也没有得到。他说，七届四中全会决议对待党员的缺点和错误采取分别对待的方针，已经写到党章草案的总纲里。实践证明，采取这种方针是有利于党的团结和党的事业的蓬勃发展的。邓小平说，为了保持党在马克思列宁主义基础上的团结和统一，为了及时地帮助同志克服缺点，纠正错误，必须大大发展党内的批评和自我批评。他指出，鼓励和支持由下而上的批评，禁止压制批评的行为，对于发展批评有决定的意义。
    邓小平在讲到党章草案中关于党员的规定时指出，党的事业的胜利，党对于人民所负责任的加重，党在人民中间威信的增长，这一切都要求党对于党员提出更高的标准。为提高党员的标准而斗争，这是当前党的重要的政治任务之一。邓小平接着分别就党章草案关于党员的条件和党员义务的一些新的规定作了说明。他说，关于党员义务的新规定，表示党对于党员的要求是更为严格了。这些规定，需要在党员中和准备入党的积极分子中，进行广泛的深入的教育。邓小平说，党在努力提高党员标准的时候，还必须注意保护和扩大党员的民主权利。他指出，党章草案把在工作中充分发挥创造性作为党员的一项权利规定下来，是有原则意义的。这个规定，不但可以大大激发广大党员在党的纪律所允许的范围内，在工作中充分集中群众智慧，运用独立思考，实事求是地、创造性地解决问题，而且可以使许多惯于墨守成规，惯于不尊重党员群众创造性的领导人员，学会改变自己的作风，从而促进党内民主的高涨。他说，草案还特别规定：侵害党员的权利就是违反党的纪律，应当给予纪律处分。这是对于党员权利的有力的保障。邓小平在报告的这一部分还说明了党章草案关于党内的奖励和处分所作的重要修改，并且谈到了党的干部问题。
    邓小平接着扼要地说明了党章草案关于党的组织机构的若干新的规定。
    邓小平在报告中最后说，中央委员会认为，党章草案对于我们党目前的状况和任务是适合的。党章草案由党的第八次全国代表大会讨论通过以后，将成为进一步提高党的质量、扩大党内民主、发扬党员的政治积极性、改善党的组织工作、加强党的团结统一和战斗力的有力武器。（附图片）
