    An Opinion from a Post Office Carrier
    I am a carrier at the Beijing Post Office. The newspapers' failure to publish on time completely disrupts the work plans of us carriers, delays delivery times, and sometimes even requires adding extra delivery shifts. When I deliver newspapers to government offices, the mail clerks question me: Why are you delivering so late? When I deliver to residents, they say: We subscribed to a morning paper, so why is it now becoming the Beijing Evening News?
    I hope that the newspaper editorial department can resolve this problem and normalize the newspaper's publication time. Liang Zezhong

    一个邮局投递员的意见
    我是北京邮局的投递员。报纸不能按时出版，整个的打乱了我们投递员的工作计划，延误了投递的时间，有时还要增加投递的班次。在我投递报纸时，到机关里，收发员就质问我：你为什么送的这样晚？到住户呢，他说：我们订的是早报呀，现在怎么变成北京晚报呢？
    希望报纸编辑部能够解决这一问题，使报纸的出版时间正常起来。　梁泽忠
