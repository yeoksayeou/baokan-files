In the Store After the Harvest
    The Jingjiang Flood Diversion Area has had a good harvest this year. Recently, the rural areas of the Flood Diversion Area have been filled with joy, and the business of department stores and supply and marketing cooperatives has doubled.
    This year, yarn has become a popular item in the stores. This is Hu Chengzong (holding the child) and his family selecting yarn at the Douhudi Town Department Store outlet. They are preparing to knit a sweater for the little baby.

    在丰收后的商店里
    荆江分洪区今年是个好收成年，最近这些日子分洪区农村到处喜气洋洋，百货公司、供销社的生意加倍的繁忙起来。
    商店里的毛线今年成了畅销品。这是胡成中（抱小孩的）一家在阧湖堤镇百货公司门市部选购毛线，他们准备给小宝宝织件毛衣。
