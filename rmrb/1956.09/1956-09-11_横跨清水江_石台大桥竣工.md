    Shidai Bridge Across the Qingshui River Completed
    Xinhua News Agency News: The first Shidai Bridge across the Qingshui River, built in the western suburbs of Kaili, the seat of the People's Committee of the Qian Dongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture, was completed on September 1. This stone bridge is one of the key projects on the Lei (Shan) Tai (Jiang) Jian (He) Highway, which runs across the Miaoling Mountains. At present, more than one-half of the Lei-Tai-Jian highway has been completed and opened to traffic, and the other part is under construction.
    The bridge, which began construction in February of this year, is 150 meters long and 4.7 meters wide, and is one of the larger stone bridges in Guizhou Province. After its completion, the large number of vehicles transporting various materials back and forth every day no longer need to rely on ferries to cross the river, and pedestrians going back and forth during the annual summer floods no longer have to wait for ferries.

    横跨清水江
    石台大桥竣工
    新华社讯　修建在黔东南苗族侗族自治州人民委员会所在地——凯里西郊的第一座横跨清水江的石台大桥，已经在9月1日竣工，这座石桥是横贯苗岭山区的雷（山）台（江）剑（河）公路上的重点工程之一。目前，雷台剑公路二分之一以上的线路已竣工通车，另一部分线路正在加紧进行建筑。
    这座桥今年二月开始修建，全长一百五十公尺，宽四·七公尺，是贵州省目前较大的一座石桥。它建成以后，每日来往运输各种物资的大批汽车，再不需要靠摆渡过江，每年夏季山洪暴发时，来往的行人也再不用等渡船了。
