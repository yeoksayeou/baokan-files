    "Our Uyghur District Party Secretary"
    Keming
    One summer evening, I visited Comrade Liu Wenli, Deputy Secretary of the Tokzak District Party Committee in the southwest of the ancient city of Kashgar. He is one of the more outstanding district party secretaries in Xinjiang in terms of learning agricultural technology and the local ethnic language.

    In his small office room, there are many agricultural technology and knowledge books and periodicals that he ordered himself. He often quietly studies agricultural technology in the evenings after a busy day. Liu Wenli also planted experimental fields for crops: robust corn, with long leaves swaying in the breeze, each stalk bearing two or three ears of corn, estimated to yield about 1,500 jin per mu. This is the result of his personal efforts, from sowing to field management, based on the agricultural technology he learned. A neat and green patch of cotton plants is full of green bolls. Liu Wenli carried out a series of field management tasks on this cotton patch, such as thinning, setting seedlings, and pruning, putting the agricultural knowledge learned from books into practice.

    In the past, Liu Wenli knew very well that the corn planted by the farmers was curling up with thin, dry leaves and should have been watered earlier, but he never had sufficient scientific reasons to persuade the farmers to water. Now, no one regards him as an amateur in planting crops anymore. At the beginning of this summer, he led district and township cadres to launch an insect control campaign, and used his learned agricultural knowledge to guide farmers in eliminating most of the cutworm pupae in the cotton fields. In order to change the local farmers' habit of tilling the land with wooden planks, Liu Wenli spent a whole day weaving a willow threshing drag and personally conducted experiments in the field. When the farmers saw the loose and fine soil exposed in the fields tilled by the district party secretary for them, they were all moved and persuaded, and immediately adopted the willow threshing drag for tilling the land.

    In his busy work, Liu Wenli also learned the Uyghur language in a very short period of time, and speaks it fluently. He said: Working here, if you don't know the local ethnic language, it is not easy to do a good job even with work ability, work enthusiasm, and familiarity with the business.

    Liu Wenli came from a poor peasant family in rural Shanxi. He joined the army at a young age and had never read a book before. When he left the army to work locally, everything was unfamiliar. In 1953, he and the Uyghur District Party Secretary were assigned to be responsible for the grain requisition work. He happened to encounter a translator with a low level of proficiency. The translator often translated what he said to the masses into a different meaning. Sometimes, he spent a lot of time explaining the principles to the masses, but because the translator could not translate, the masses did not understand anything, and the work could not be carried out. As a result, the Uyghur District Party Secretary completed the grain requisition task, while the area he was responsible for only completed 80%, which affected the completion of the entire district's grain requisition task. While Liu Wenli was distressed, he also learned that the Uyghur District Party Secretary also shed tears for not completing the entire district's grain requisition task. What a great stimulus this was to him! He felt that the work he was responsible for was more arduous and complicated than a combat mission, and that he could not bear the heavy burden of local work. Therefore, he had the idea of returning to the army and began to feel uneasy about local work.

    While Liu Wenli was struggling ideologically, the Party's general line for the transition period was announced. In the study of the general line, he realized the importance of the work he was responsible for. He also thought of his background in a poor peasant family, having suffered hardships, how could he not be at ease with the work of helping farmers live a happy life? At this time, his close old comrades-in-arms also wrote letters from the army, encouraging him to do a good job in rural work and to carry forward the fine traditions of the People's Liberation Army of being brave, strong, and overcoming difficulties. Liu Wenli secretly shed a few excited tears, determined not to let down the expectations of the Party and comrades, and strengthened his confidence in serving the ethnic minorities in the border areas for a long time. From then on, Liu Wenli began to intensively study Uyghur. He studied anytime, anywhere, and did not let go of any possible opportunity to use. When listening to farmers speak, he paid attention to the words and pronunciation of each sentence and recorded them in a notebook. In order to pronounce correctly, he often looked for Uyghur people to talk to. After more than two years of diligent and serious study, he was finally able to speak Uyghur fluently.

    Learning Uyghur broke down the language barrier between him and the local farmers, making work much more convenient and strengthening ties with the masses. When he went to the countryside, the farmers automatically gathered around him and talked to him very enthusiastically in Uyghur. The farmers were willing to talk to him about everything, and they were willing to listen to what he said. Therefore, the Uyghur farmers all called him "Our Uyghur District Party Secretary."

    “我们维吾尔族的区委书记”
    克敏
    盛夏的一个傍晚，我访问了喀什噶尔古城西南边沿托克扎克区的区委副书记刘文礼同志。他是新疆许多区委书记中学习农业技术和当地民族语言比较出色的一个。
    在他的办公室的小房间里，摆着许多他自己订购的农业技术和农业知识书刊。他常常在奔忙了一整天以后的夜晚，静静地钻研农业技术。刘文礼还种了农作物试验田：茁壮的玉米，在微风中摆动着长叶子，每棵都挂上了两、三个玉米棒子，估计每亩可产一千五百斤左右。这是他根据学到的农业技术，从播种到田间管理亲手做的结果。一片整齐青绿的棉株，结满了累累的绿桃。刘文礼就在这片棉株上进行过间苗、定苗、打杈等一系列的田间管理工作，利用书本上学来的农业知识进行实践。
    过去，刘文礼明明知道农民种的玉米卷起了细长的枯叶，是早应该浇水了，可是总没有充足的科学理由说服农民去浇水。现在，再也没有人把他当作种庄稼的门外汉了。今年初夏，他领导区乡干部发动农民开展了除虫运动，并且用自己学会的农业知识指导农民铲除了大部棉田的地老虎蛹。为了改变当地农民用木板磨地的习惯，刘文礼用了一整天时间，编制了一个柳条磨，亲自到地里做试验。当农民看到区委书记为他们磨过的田野上，露出了松碎的细土的时候，个个都被感动了，被说服了。立即采用了柳条磨磨地。
    刘文礼在繁忙的工作中，还用很短的时间学会了维吾尔族语言，而且说得很流俐。他说：在这里工作，如果不会当地民族的语言，光靠工作能力、工作热情和熟悉业务，还是不容易把工作做好的。
    刘文礼出身于山西农村一个贫苦的农民家庭，从小就参了军，过去根本没有读过书，他离开部队到地方工作，一切都是陌生的。1953年，他和维吾尔族的区委书记分工负责征粮工作，他正好遇到一个业务水平不高的翻译，翻译常常把他对群众说的话翻成了另外的意思。有时候，他花费很多时间给群众讲道理，因为翻译不出来，群众一点也听不懂，工作开展不起来。结果维吾尔族的区委书记完成了征粮任务，而他负责的地区只完成了80％，影响了全区征粮任务的完成。刘文礼正在苦恼的时候，又知道了维吾尔族区委书记也为没有完成全区征粮任务而流了一次眼泪。这对他是多么大的刺激啊！他感到自己负责的工作比战斗任务还艰巨复杂，自己担负不起地方工作的重担子，因此有了回部队的念头，开始不安心于地方工作。
    刘文礼正在思想斗争的时候，党在过渡时期的总路线公布了。在总路线的学习中，他认识了所担负的工作的重要性。他又联想到自己出身于贫苦的农民家庭，受过苦，还能不安心于帮助农民过幸福生活的工作吗？这时候，他的亲密的老战友，也从部队纷纷来信，鼓励他做好农村工作，发扬人民解放军勇敢坚强和克服困难的优良传统。刘文礼偷偷地流了几滴激动的泪珠，决心不辜负党和同志对自己的希望，坚定了长期为边疆少数民族服务的信心。从此，刘文礼开始突击学习维吾尔语。他随时随地学习，不放松一切可能利用的机会。在听农民讲话的时候，他就注意着每句话的辞句和发音，并记在笔记本上。为了发音正确，他还经常找维吾尔族人去谈话。经过两年多的刻苦认真学习，他终于能够流俐地用维语讲话了。
    学会了维吾尔语，打破了同当地农民之间的语言壁障，工作方便多了，同群众的联系密切了。当他到农村的时候，农民们自动地围拢来，和他用维吾尔语谈得非常热情。农民有事情都愿意和他谈，他讲的话农民也愿意听。所以，维吾尔族农民们都称他“我们维吾尔族的区委书记”。（附图片）
