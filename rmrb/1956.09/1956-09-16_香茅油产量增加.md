Xinhua News Agency report:

Citronella oil production in Hainan Island and the Leizhou Peninsula in Guangdong Province is currently in its peak season. Many state-owned reclamation farms and agricultural production cooperatives are busy processing the harvested citronella grass. According to statistics, more than 170 tons of citronella oil have been produced by mid-August this year. It is estimated that nearly 300 tons of citronella oil can be produced throughout the year, more than double the amount of last year.

Citronella oil is a fragrance with high economic value, used in the manufacture of cosmetics and hygiene products. In order to meet the needs of domestic and foreign markets, the planting area of citronella grass in Hainan Island and Leizhou Peninsula has been greatly expanded this year, and 21 state-owned reclamation farms have expanded or built new citronella processing plants. In addition, four local state-owned citronella oil factories will be completed in the fourth quarter.

    香茅油产量增加
    据新华社讯　广东省海南岛和雷州半岛的香茅油生产，目前已到旺季。很多国营垦殖场和农业生产合作社忙着把收割下来的香茅草加工。据统计，今年到8月中旬为止已经生产了香茅油一百七十多吨。预计今年全年可以生产香茅油近三百吨，比去年增加一倍多。
    香茅油是一种经济价值很高，制造化妆品和卫生用品用的香料。为了适应国内外市场的需要，今年海南岛、雷州半岛的香茅草种植面积有很大的扩充，同时有二十一个国营垦殖场扩建或新建了香茅加工厂。另外，还有四个地方国营香茅油厂将在第四季度建成。
