Moscow, September 29th (by our correspondent) – On the evening of September 28th, a grand gathering was held in the Pillar Hall of the Trade Union Building in Moscow to celebrate the seventh anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. The gathering was jointly organized by the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, the Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, and the Soviet Ministry of Culture. At 7:30 PM, the hall was filled with workers, scientists, artists, representatives of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, Soviet ministers, Soviet and Party workers from Moscow, personnel from the Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union, and Chinese students studying in the Soviet Union. Behind the rostrum, hung two huge flags of the Soviet Union and China, with the words "The unbreakable fraternal friendship and cooperation between the Soviet and Chinese people will last forever and prosper!" written in Chinese and Russian between the two flags.

At 7:40 PM, the people present stood up and applauded to welcome the members of the presidium, including Kaganovich, Mikoyan, Pervukhin, Aristov, Tevosyan, Chen Chu, Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of the Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union, and representatives of the working people of Moscow.

The celebration began with an opening speech by Yelyutin, Minister of Higher Education of the Soviet Union, who, on behalf of those present, paid tribute to the great Chinese people and the glorious Chinese Communist Party. After the band played the national anthems of China and the Soviet Union, Yelyutin invited Aristov, Secretary of the Central Committee of the CPSU, to deliver a report. Aristov's lengthy report spoke of the historic achievements made by the Chinese people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party in socialist construction over the past seven years, and of the great role played by the People's Republic of China on the international stage. After Aristov's report, Chen Chu, Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of the Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union, spoke, reviewing the glorious path the Chinese people have traveled in the past seven years, and emphasizing China's peaceful foreign policy in its external relations. Both of their speeches were warmly welcomed by the audience.
