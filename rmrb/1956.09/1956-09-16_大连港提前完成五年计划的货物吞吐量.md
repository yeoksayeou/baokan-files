Xinhua News Agency, Lüda, September 13th: Dalian Port completed its first Five-Year Plan's cargo throughput seventeen months ahead of schedule, and has been commended by the Ministry of Communications and the National Committee of the China Seamen's Union.

In recent years, in order to fully leverage its maritime transportation potential, Dalian Port has proactively dispatched a large number of cadres to reside in various parts of Northeast China to conduct economic investigations and analyses. By fully grasping the flow of goods and vigorously organizing cargo sources, they reversed the long-standing imbalance of ships transporting goods from the south returning empty. This has resulted in an average annual increase of over 26% in maritime freight volume since 1953, saving the state a great deal of transportation costs and reducing the burden on land transportation.

Since 1953, Dalian Port has also received more than 1,000 large ships from twenty-two countries for trade. In this large port, it is common to see more than a dozen to twenty large ships arriving in a single day, loaded with minerals, cement, rubber, building materials, hardware and other materials. After a very short time, these ships are fully loaded with Northeast specialties such as soybeans, sea salt, as well as steel, minerals, coal, machinery and many other kinds of industrial products, slowly sailing out of the port and heading to dozens of ports abroad.

The degree of mechanization of loading and unloading at Dalian Port has also been greatly improved. Entering the port, one can see trains, various transport vehicles, conveyors, and cranes of various capabilities extending directly along the wharf. The speed of loading and unloading here has deeply impressed many captains and sailors from other countries. A large Japanese ship came to load minerals, and the workers completed the loading in just over two days. The captain of the ship highly praised the high degree of mechanization and extremely high loading and unloading speed.

    大连港提前完成五年计划的货物吞吐量
    新华社旅大13日电　大连海港提前十七个月完成了第一个五年计划的货物吞吐量，受到了交通部和中国海员工会全国委员会的表扬。
    几年来，大连海港为了充分发挥海上运输潜力，主动地派出了大批干部常驻在东北各地进行经济调查和分析，充分掌握货源流向，大力组织了货源，扭转了长期存在的由南方运货来的轮船空着舱驶回去的运输不平衡情况，使海上运货量，自1953年以来每年平均增加了26％以上，给国家节省了很多运费，减轻了陆地运输的负担。
    从1953年以来，大连海港还接待了来作买卖的二十二个国家的一千多艘次的大轮船。在这个大港里，经常可以看到，一天内有十几艘到二十几艘大船载着矿砂、水泥、橡胶、建筑材料和五金器材等物资驶来。这些船只又都是经过很短的时间，满载着东北的特产大豆、海盐以及钢材、矿砂、煤、机器等许多种工业品，徐徐地驶出港口，开向国外的几十个港口。
    大连海港装卸机械化程度也已经有很大提高。人们进入海港，就会看到直通码头沿岸的火车、各种运输车辆和传送机，以及各种性能的起重机。这里装卸效率的迅速，给不少国家的船长和海员们以很深的印象。曾经有一艘日本大船来装矿砂，工人们只用两天多一点的时间装完了这艘大船。这个船的船长十分赞扬这里搬运的高度机械化和极高的装卸速度。
