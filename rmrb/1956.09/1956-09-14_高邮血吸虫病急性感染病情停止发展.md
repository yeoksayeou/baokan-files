    Acute Schistosomiasis Infection in Gaoyou Stops Developing
    (From Our Newspaper) Gaoyou County, Jiangsu Province, the acute schistosomiasis infection has completely stopped developing, and most acutely infected patients have been cured and discharged from the hospital.
    In June and July of this year, some members of agricultural cooperatives in Gaoyou County were infected with schistosomiasis due to cutting grass on the reed marshes. After relevant departments took emergency measures to rescue and treat more than 350 acutely infected patients, by August 20, 160 of these patients had been cured and discharged from the hospital, 185 had their fevers reduced and basically returned to normal. Only seven still had fevers and needed to continue to be hospitalized for treatment.
    During the rescue and treatment process, many medical personnel went to Nanjing and other places overnight to purchase medicines and medical equipment when there were not enough medicines and equipment available, so that some patients were injected with expensive medicines such as "adrenocorticotropic hormone." The Gaoyou County People's Committee successively allocated a total of 4,900 yuan as subsidies for patients' medical expenses, nutrition, food, and other expenses, and rushed to produce 100 mosquito nets for patients, ensuring that the overall condition did not deteriorate. The patients and their families are very grateful for the rescue by the Communist Party and the People's Government and expressed that they will repay the kindness with actions to improve production. At present, the acute schistosomiasis infection in Gaoyou County has completely stopped developing.

    高邮血吸虫病急性感染病情停止发展
    本报讯　江苏省高邮县血吸虫病急性感染病情已经完全停止发展，大部分急性感染病人已经治愈出院。
    今年六、七月间，高邮县部分农业社员由于在芦滩上割草感染了血吸虫病，经过有关部门采取紧急措施，对三百五十多名急性感染的病人进行了抢救治疗，至8月20日止，这些病人中已有一百六十人治愈出院，一百八十五人热度已退，基本恢复正常，只有七人尚有热度，需继续住院治疗。
    在抢救治疗过程中，许多医务人员在药剂及医疗器材不够的情况下，连夜到南京等地购买，使得有些病人注射了“促肾上腺皮质激素”等贵重药剂。高邮县人民委员会先后共拨出四千九百元，作为补助病人的医药、营养、伙食等费用，并为病人赶制蚊帐一百顶，保证了整个病情没有发生恶化。病人和病人家属十分感激共产党和人民政府的抢救，表示要以搞好生产的行动来报答恩情。目前，高邮县血吸虫病急性感染已经完全停止发展。
