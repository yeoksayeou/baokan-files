    To improve railway transport capacity, and the quality of new railway lines, we must systematically and with emphasis, actively strengthen technical equipment, gradually adopt new technologies, and continue to strengthen transport organization.
    Although the progress of new railway construction projects is very fast, the quality of certain projects is low, and there are serious defects; we must vigorously strengthen geological and hydrological exploration work, focus on the quality of railway design, and comprehensively implement the policy of more, faster, better, and more economical.
    I fully agree with Comrade Mao Zedong's opening address, and with the reports of Comrades Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, and Deng Xiaoping, and I agree with the revised Party Constitution and the proposals for the Second Five-Year Plan.
    Both Comrade Liu Shaoqi and Comrade Zhou Enlai mentioned the situation of the railway transport industry in completing the First Five-Year Plan in their reports. Indeed, for more than three years, under the leadership of Party and government at all levels and with the support of all parties, Chinese railway workers and railway soldiers have been working hard to complete the transportation and construction tasks in the Five-Year Plan. The average daily number of freight cars loaded in the first half of this year is equivalent to 96.2 percent of the 1957 plan. In recent years, it has basically met the country's transportation needs for railways. The new railway construction of more than 4,000 kilometers stipulated in the Five-Year Plan will also be over-fulfilled this year, and the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge can also be completed ahead of schedule. At the same time, 620 kilometers of double-track railways and 1,230 kilometers of new dedicated railway lines have been built. The completion of these tasks has played a certain role in the development of China's national economy. However, there are still many problems in the process of implementing the Five-Year Plan. Now I will only talk about two issues: the transport capacity of operating railways and the quality of new railway construction.

    What is the situation of China's operating railway transport capacity? As of now, from the perspective of major technical equipment, apart from the newly built large freight cars, the restoration and improvement on the old foundation has been made in locomotives, station yards, or signals. Thanks to the Chinese railway workers learning from the advanced experience of Soviet railways and giving full play to their creative labor, the efficiency of railway transportation has indeed been improved. For example, in 1955, China's freight car turnaround time was 2.99 days, and the average daily mileage of freight locomotives was 363.8 kilometers, and the efficiency was relatively high. Therefore, the reason why we can achieve such high efficiency is partly due to the adoption of certain technical measures, such as increasing and lengthening station lines, expanding station yards, and adding large vehicles. But the main reason is due to the adoption of organizational measures, that is, widely organizing collaboration, adopting rotation training and short-term training to improve labor proficiency, carrying out full-load, over-axle, and 500-kilometer campaigns, and strengthening transportation organization. However, because our technical measures have not kept up, the labor intensity of some employees has become too tense, and the transportation on some major trunk lines is often in a state of consuming reserve strength. For example, due to the continuous increase in the traction weight of freight trains, the locomotive stokers on some major trunk lines now have to shovel two and a half tons of coal from the coal car every hour and throw it into the locomotive firebox shovel by shovel. This labor intensity is very high. Due to the increase in train length and train frequency, the labor intensity of vehicle dispatchers, repair workers, line maintenance workers, and loading and unloading workers at stations has also increased accordingly. From the perspective of equipment utilization, the utilization of the passing capacity of lines such as Beijing to Zhengzhou, Shijiazhuang to Taiyuan, and the western section of the Longhai Line has reached saturation, often resulting in the accumulation of freight cars and station blockages. Even in these areas, situations have occurred where transportation tasks could not be completed. In terms of passenger transport, passengers often cannot buy tickets or find seats on the train. Especially now that the Baoji-Lanzhou Railway is being renovated for defects and transportation is suspended for eight hours every day, the transportation situation is even more prominent. The above facts have clearly exposed the contradiction between the current efficiency and technical equipment of China's railways and the contradiction between railway transport capacity and the needs of economic construction.

    Why does this happen? In addition to the rapid increase in freight volume in some areas due to the overall upsurge in the national economy, and the relatively concentrated flow of goods, as well as certain shortcomings in our transportation organization work; it is mainly because we are satisfied with being able to complete transportation tasks in recent years. Therefore, there is a lack of strong leadership and systematic organization for the technical transformation of operating railways, and there is a lack of timely supervision over the failure to complete the technical transformation plan in recent years. Many difficulties encountered in the process of technical transformation, such as the expansion of many hubs, involve urban planning, and the reconstruction of many lines involves basin planning, water level elevation, or disagreement among relevant departments, and many problems have not been resolved in a timely manner, resulting in delays in the design of technical transformation plans, which has affected the project again and again. As for the application of new technologies in technical transformation, from the perspective of major technical equipment, it has basically not yet begun. If these situations continue, there will be a serious disconnect between the railway transportation industry and national construction.

    In order to meet the even greater transportation requirements of the Second Five-Year Plan, it is necessary to systematically and with emphasis, actively strengthen the technical equipment of railway transportation and gradually adopt new technologies. The railway freight turnover and passenger turnover in the Second Five-Year Plan will increase significantly, and most of them will be borne by the current operating lines and the trunk lines in the southwest and northwest. Therefore, strengthening the transportation capacity of the current operating railways is of decisive significance. Due to the rapid growth of freight density, in addition to continuing to strengthen transportation organization work, it is necessary to systematically adopt some new technical equipment to improve transportation capacity. Therefore, we believe that large steam locomotives should be produced as soon as possible, large freight cars and sufficient passenger cars should be produced in large quantities, diesel locomotives and electric locomotives should be adopted step by step, and signal, double-track, and hub equipment should be added. The roadbed, steel rails, and bridges must also be strengthened accordingly. These should become important construction projects on the railway. In view of the imbalance in the development of railway transportation, there should be necessary reserves in both railway passing capacity and transportation capacity. Both railway design and construction must rapidly strengthen the efforts to renovate operating lines, in order to reverse the backward situation of technical transformation projects.

    In order to rationally use various means of transportation to complete the country's transportation tasks, we should further develop water-land combined transportation. The railway has always been and will continue to be committed to this work with great effort.

    In Comrade Liu Shaoqi's political report, he mentioned that "The superiority of socialism must not only be reflected in the quantity and progress of our economic achievements, but also in its quality." I think this is completely correct. From 1953 to the end of 1955, Chinese railway new line workers and railway soldiers jointly built more than 2,600 kilometers of new railways, and this year alone, about 1,800 kilometers of new railways can be built. Although the progress has been accelerated, the quantity is far from meeting the urgent needs of our national construction for railways. From the perspective of quality, the Ji'er, Fengsha, and Lizhan lines that have been put into operation can generally be considered qualified. In recent years, with the increase in the number of new line constructions, the design and construction techniques have been continuously improved, and the cost has also been continuously reduced. However, it must be stated that the problems in new line construction are manifested on the one hand in the fact that the track-laying progress is fast, while other transportation and business-related projects are too backward; on the other hand, some projects do have serious problems of low quality. For example, when the Baoji-Chengdu Railway was selected in 1952, due to our insufficient understanding of the importance of geological and hydrological work, we did not strengthen the allocation of geological personnel and geological drilling forces, and hastily carried out the line selection design in areas with extremely complex geological conditions. At the same time, we lacked experience in the construction of geologically complex areas, resulting in a large number of collapses, landslides, and other serious defects. In the first quarter of this year, there were more than 700 major and minor collapse defects. Excluding those that have been renovated and completed, there are still more than 200 defects. The most serious eleven landslides will take a long time to gradually renovate and cannot undertake major transportation tasks in the short term. In addition, due to inaccurate flow calculations and insufficient foundation depth, the Weihe River Bridge on the Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway was destroyed by floods; some culverts were built on high-filled roadbeds, and rainwater washed away the roadbed during the rainy season, etc. Some of these engineering quality problems are related to our design technology level and technical conditions at that time. However, some engineering quality defects can be completely avoided. For example, in order to rush the work and speed up the opening to traffic, the concrete bottoming project of Tunnel No. 33 of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway was track laid before the curing period was sufficient, resulting in the tunnel bottom being crushed; Tunnel No. 21 in the middle section of Baoji-Chengdu encroached on the building clearance by 30 centimeters. All of this seriously violated the central government's principle of seeking "more" and "faster" on the basis of "good" and "economical". These acts of reckless work on the construction site are precisely caused by our bureaucracy and commandism.

    In order to further improve the engineering quality of new railway construction, we are prepared to vigorously strengthen geological and hydrological exploration work, focus on improving the quality of railway design, comprehensively implement the policy of more, faster, better, and more economical, and under normal circumstances, resolutely implement the principle of designing before construction, resolutely implement the principle of balanced construction according to plan, oppose blindly rushing work and formalistic deadlines for opening to traffic, improve the supervision system in the construction process, and strictly implement the acceptance system. In addition to assigning construction units to actively carry out the defect renovation of the current Baoji-Chengdu Railway and Baoji-Lanzhou Railway, we will also establish a special geological research institution to cooperate with the renovation to solve the problems in a relatively short period. In order to guarantee the construction of the northwest and southwest, we suggest that the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway and the Xiangqian Railway be built as soon as possible, so as to quickly form the second trunk line connecting the northwest and southwest.

    There are serious shortcomings in railway leadership work in recent years, mainly arising from our subjectivism and bureaucracy. I believe that under the leadership of the Party and under the supervision of the whole Party, further improve our political and ideological level, improve our work style, promote the strength of collective leadership, go deep into reality, seek truth from facts, closely rely on the working class, correct our shortcomings, we have full confidence that we will be able to complete the transportation and construction tasks assigned to us by the Party.

    提高铁路的运输能力和新建铁路的质量
    铁道部部长　滕代远同志的发言
    铁路运输能力还赶不上经济建设发展的需要，必须有计划、有重点地积极加强技术装备，逐步采用新技术，并继续加强运输组织工作。
    新建线路工程虽然进展很快，但某些工程质量低劣，病害严重；准备大力加强地质、水文勘探工作，把重点放在铁路设计质量方面，全面贯彻多、快、好、省的方针。
    我完全同意毛泽东同志的开幕词，同意刘少奇同志、周恩来同志、邓小平同志的报告，同意修改了的党的章程和第二个五年计划的建议。
    在刘少奇同志和周恩来同志的报告中都曾提到铁路运输业完成第一个五年计划的情况。的确，三年多来，在各级党、政领导和各方面的支持下，我国铁路职工和铁道兵为了完成五年计划中的运输和建设任务，是在努力工作着的。今年上半年平均每天的货物装车数已相当于一九五七年计划的百分之九十六点二，几年来，基本上满足了国家对铁路的运输需要。五年计划所规定的新建铁路四千余公里也将在今年超额完成，武汉长江大桥也可提前完成。与此同时，还修建铁路复线六百二十公里、新建铁路专用线一千二百三十公里，这些任务的完成，对我国国民经济的发展起了一定的作用。但是我们在执行五年计划的过程中也还存在着不少问题，现在我只讲营业铁路运输能力和新建铁路质量两个问题：
    我国营业铁路运输能力的情况是怎样的呢？截至目前为止，从主要技术装备方面看，除掉新造大型货车以外，无论在机车、站场或信号等方面，基本上都是在旧基础上的恢复和改善。由于全国铁路职工学习了苏联铁路的先进经验，发挥了创造性的劳动，铁路运输的效率确实提高了。例如一九五五年，我国货车周转时间为二点九九天、货物机车平均每天走行三百六十三点八公里等，效率都是比较高的。所以能够达到这样高的效率，一部分是采取了若干技术措施，如增加和延长站线、扩大站场、增添大型车辆等等。但主要还是由于采取组织措施，即广泛组织协作，采取轮训、短训的办法提高劳动熟练程度，开展满载、超轴、五百公里运动，加强了运输组织工作得来的。但因为我们的技术措施没有跟上，曾发生了某些职工劳动强度过于紧张和某些主要干线的运输常常处于耗用后备力量的情况。例如，由于货物列车牵引定数的不断提高，目前有些主要干线上的机车司炉，每小时要把两吨半煤从煤车上扒下来，并且一锹一锹地投到机车火室里去，这种劳动强度是非常高的。由于列车长度、列车次数的增加，车站上的车辆调度工人和检修工人、线路养护工人、装卸搬运工人的劳动强度也都相应地增高了。从设备利用状况讲，如北京至郑州、石家庄至太原和陇海线西段的通过能力的利用已达饱和，常常发生货车积压、车站堵塞、甚至在这几个方面上，曾经发生过完不成运输任务的情况。在客运方面，则常常发生旅客买不到票、上车找不到座位等现象。特别是目前由于宝兰线进行整治病害，每天停止八小时运输，运输的紧张情况就更加突出。以上事实已经很明显地暴露出目前我国铁路效率和技术装备之间的矛盾以及铁路运输能力和经济建设需要之间的矛盾。
    为什么会出现这种情况呢？除了由于国民经济的全面高涨，某些地区运量上涨比预计的要快，而且货流比较集中，以及我们在运输组织工作方面也还存在着一定的缺点外；主要是由于我们满足于几年来还能完成运输任务，因而对于营业铁路技术改造缺乏强有力的领导和系统的组织工作，对几年来技术改造计划没有完成，缺乏及时的监督，而在进行技术改造过程中遇到的若干困难，如很多枢纽的扩建，牵涉到城市规划，许多线路的改建，牵涉到流域规划、水位标高或有关部门意见不一等等，很多问题未能及时求得解决，致使技术改造的设计方案迟迟不定，影响工程一再推延。至于技术改造中对新技术的采用，从主要技术装备上说，基本上还没有开始。这些情况如果继续下去，铁路运输业和国家建设将要发生严重的脱节现象。
    为了满足第二个五年计划更加巨大的运输要求，必须有计划有重点地积极地加强铁路运输的技术装备，逐步采用新技术。第二个五年计划的铁路货物周转量与旅客周转量均将有大量增加，同时绝大部分要由目前的营业线路和西南、西北的干线来负担，因此，加强目前营业铁路的运输能力是有决定意义的。由于货运密度增长的迅速，提高运输能力的办法，除了继续加强运输组织工作以外，必须有计划地采用一部分新的技术装备，因此，我们认为应该早日生产大型蒸气机车、大量生产大型的货车和足够的客车，有步骤地采用内燃机车和电力机车，增建信号、复线、枢纽等设备，路基、钢轨、桥梁也须相应加强。这些应该成为铁路上重要的建设项目。鉴于铁路运输发展的不平衡，在铁路通过能力和输送能力方面，都应该有必要的后备力量。铁路的设计和施工方面都必须迅速加强改造营业线路的力量，以扭转技术改造工程落后的局面。
    为了合理地使用各种运输工具完成国家的运输任务，应该更进一步地发展水陆联运，铁路方面一向是而且今后还要以大力来进行这一工作。
    在刘少奇同志的政治报告中曾经说到“社会主义的优越性，不但要表现在我们的经济成就的数量和进度上面，还必须表现在它的质量上面”。我认为这是完全正确的。自一九五三年起，到一九五五年底止，我国铁路新线职工和铁道兵一起，共同新建铁路二千六百余公里，而今年一年就可新建铁路一千八百公里左右，虽然进度是加快了，但数量还远远赶不上我们国家建设对铁路的迫切需要。从质量方面看，已经交付营业的集二、丰沙、黎湛等线，一般说来，还算合格。几年来，随着新线建设数量的增多，设计和施工的技术也都在不断提高，造价也是不断降低的。但是必须说明，新线建设方面的问题，一方面表现在铺轨进度快，而其他运输营业必须的工程过于落后；另一方面某些工程确实存在着质量低劣的严重情况。例如宝成线，一九五二年进行选线时，由于我们对地质和水文工作的重要性认识不足，没有加强地质人员和地质钻探力量的配备，就在地质情况极为复杂的地带仓促地进行了选线设计，同时对于地质复杂地带的施工也缺乏经验，因而出现了大量坍方滑坡等严重病害，今年第一季度发生的大小坍方病害七百余处，除掉整治完工的还有二百余处，其中最严重的十一处滑坡还要化较长的时间逐步整治，在短时期内还不能担负较大的运输任务。此外，由于流量计算的不准确和基础深度不足，天兰线渭河桥被洪水冲坏；有些涵洞设在高填土路基上，雨季水来把路基冲垮等等。这些工程质量问题有些是和我们当时的设计技术水平和技术条件有关的。但是有一些工程质量低劣是完全可以避免的，如为了赶工图快，急于通车，宝成线三十三号隧道混凝土铺底工程养生期不够就进行铺轨，结果把隧道底轧坏；宝成中段二十一号隧道侵入建筑限界达三十公分，诸如此类，严重地违反中央在“好”和“省”的基础上求“多”求“快”的原则。这些施工现场的蛮干作风正是我们的官僚主义和命令主义所造成的。
    为了进一步提高新建铁路的工程质量，我们准备大力加强地质、水文勘探工作，把重点放在提高铁路设计质量方面，全面贯彻执行多、快、好、省的方针，在正常情况下，坚决执行先设计后施工，坚决执行按计划均衡施工，反对盲目赶工和形式主义地限期通车，健全施工过程中的监察制度，严格执行验收制度。对于目前宝成线和宝兰线的病害整治，除责成施工单位积极进行外，还要成立专门的地质研究机构配合进行，争取在较短的期间内加以解决。为了保证西北、西南的建设，我们建议尽早修建包兰线和湘黔线，以便迅速构成沟通西北、西南的第二条干线。
    几年来，铁路领导工作中是有严重缺点的，主要是从我们的主观主义和官僚主义所产生，我相信：在党的领导下和全党监督之下，进一步提高我们的政治思想水平，改进我们的工作作风，发扬集体领导的力量，深入实际，实事求是，紧紧地依靠工人阶级，改正我们的缺点，我们有充分的信心一定能够完成党交给我们的运输和建设任务。
