　　Virtue and Talent
　　Bi Gan
    In a certain organization's evaluation, some people are assessed as "lacking virtue," some as "lacking talent," and some as "possessing both virtue and talent." The basis for being assessed as "lacking virtue" is mainly the so-called "difficult to lead," while the basis for being assessed as "lacking talent" is mainly the so-called "not good at understanding the leader's intentions." Those deemed to possess both virtue and talent are those who are "both easy to lead and good at understanding the leader's intentions."

    This standard of evaluation cannot be said to be completely without reason, but upon closer examination, the issue is not so simple.

    "Easy or difficult to lead" is certainly related to "virtue," but to regard all those who are difficult to lead as lacking virtue is rather too arbitrary. This "easy or difficult to lead" is often subjectively determined by the leader and lacks objective criteria. If a leader considers someone who frequently criticizes shortcomings in the work, offers suggestions, and works actively and completes tasks relatively well as "talented but lacking virtue," this is worth considering. The criticisms of those who dare to criticize the leadership may not all be completely pertinent, and the suggestions of those who dare to make suggestions may not all be practically feasible, but the spirit is always good, and this atmosphere should always be promoted. If such cadres are judged as "difficult to lead" and said to be "lacking virtue," it is a bit much. There are such examples in the above-mentioned organization.

    "Ability to understand the leader's intentions" is certainly not completely unrelated to "talent." However, to say that all those who are "not good at understanding the leader's intentions" are "lacking talent" is bound to cause problems. If the leader's intentions sometimes tend to be conservative or rash due to insufficient understanding of the actual situation, should the subordinates be "good at understanding" and persist in error to the end? Of course, the unique insights of those who frequently raise different opinions to the leader's intentions are not necessarily all appropriate, and the methods thought out by those who can come up with solutions at work are not necessarily all scientific. But if the leader uses some inappropriate insights and methods as examples to dismiss their creativity altogether and calls this so-called "not good at understanding the leader's intentions," judging them as "lacking talent," isn't this too dictatorial?

    Many people who are "easy to lead and good at understanding the leader's intentions" are indeed people who possess both virtue and talent. But if this is used solely as the standard for evaluating cadres, and no specific analysis is made of specific people and things, then some cadres who don't use their brains and are merely yes-men may be confused with cadres who truly possess both virtue and talent.

    The virtue we need is the virtue of loyalty to the people and the people's cause, not the "virtue" of loyalty to a certain individual; the talent we need is the talent of constantly using our brains and actively exerting creativity, not the "talent" of merely nodding and "understanding the leader's intentions." To be honest, such "talent" may not truly understand the leader's intentions or implement them.

    Don't believe it? Take a serious look.

    德和才

    一个机关里在评级中，有些人被评为“无德”，有些人被评为“无才”，也有些人被评为“德才兼备”。被评为“无德”的根据主要是所谓“不好领导”，被评为“无才”的根据又主要是所谓“不善于领会领导意图”，而德才兼备的人则是所谓“既好领导又善于领会领导意图”的人。
    这种评级的标准，不能说全无道理，但细究起来，问题并不如此简单。
    “好不好领导”固然与“德”不无关系，但把不好领导统统视为无德，未免过于武断。这“好不好领导”往往是由领导者主观判定，并无客观标准。如果领导者把经常批评工作中的缺点，提出建议，积极工作而能较好完成任务的人，称作“有才无德”，这就值得考虑了。敢于批评领导的人，其批评不见得件件都完全中肯，敢于提出建议的人，其建议也不见得件件都切实可行，但这精神总是好的，这风气总是应该提倡的。如果判定这样的干部为“不好领导”，说他“无德”，未免太那个了。在上述的机关中，就有这样的实例。
    “能不能领会领导意图”，当然也并不是完全与“才”无关。但是，要把“不善于领会领导意图”统统说成是“无才”，也就不免要出问题。倘若领导者由于了解实际情况不够，其意图有时偏于保守或者冒进了，是不是也要被领导者来“善于领会”、坚持错误到底呢？当然，对领导者的意图，经常提出独特见解的人，不见得所有见解都妥当，在工作中能够想出办法的人，其办法也不见得样样都科学。但领导者如以若干不妥的见解和办法作例，一概抹煞其创造性，并称这是所谓“不善于领会领导意图”，判人一个“无才”，这不是太专断了吗？
    “好领导和善于领会领导意图”的人，确有不少是德才兼备的。但是如果仅仅以此为评选干部的标准，不对具体的人和事进行具体的分析，那就可能把一些不动脑筋、唯唯诺诺的干部同真正德才兼备的干部混淆起来。
    我们所需要的德是忠于人民和人民事业的德，而不是忠于某一个人的“德”；我们所需要的才，是不断开动脑筋、积极发挥创造性的才，而不是唯唯诺诺地所谓“领会领导意图”的“才”，老实说，这样的“才”未必能真正领会领导意图，贯彻执行领导意图。
    不相信吗？认真检查一下吧。
