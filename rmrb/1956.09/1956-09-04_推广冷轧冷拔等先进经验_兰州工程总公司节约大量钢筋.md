Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, September 2nd. After the Lanzhou Engineering Corporation of the Ministry of Construction Engineering promoted advanced experiences such as steel cold rolling, cold drawing, and cold stretching, it has already saved more than 400 tons of steel. According to engineers from the company, the more than 2,000 tons of steel the company is short of in the second half of this year can be saved by promoting these advanced experiences.

After steel is cold-rolled, cold-drawn, and cold-stretched, the length of the steel can be increased by more than 4%, and the strength of the steel is also greatly improved. Concrete components made with this kind of steel can generally save 20%-30% of steel; cold rolling and cold drawing save the most. This year, the most lacking steel at various construction sites of the Lanzhou Engineering Corporation is No. 5 steel; after No. 3 steel is cold-rolled, it can be used to replace No. 5 steel, and the quality can be guaranteed.

In the process of promoting these advanced experiences, the Lanzhou Engineering Corporation manufactured its own steel cold rolling mills and cold drawing machines, and came up with a method of using winches to replace cold drawing machines. The cold rolling mills they manufacture are better than those allocated by the state, and can not only cold roll large-sized steel, but also cold roll small-sized steel.

    推广冷轧冷拔等先进经验
    兰州工程总公司节约大量钢筋
    新华社兰州2日电　建筑工程部兰州工程总公司推广钢筋冷轧、冷拔和冷拉等先进经验以后，已经节约了四百多吨钢筋。据这个公司的工程师谈，今年下半年公司缺少的两千多吨钢筋，可以从推广这些先进经验中节约出来。
    钢筋冷轧、冷拔和冷拉以后，钢筋的长度可以增加4％以上，而且钢筋的坚固性也提高很多。用这种钢筋做成的混凝土构件，一般可以节约钢筋20％—30％；其中节约最多的，是冷轧和冷拔。今年兰州工程总公司各工地最缺的是五号钢筋；把三号钢筋冷轧以后，就可以代替五号钢筋使用，而且还能保证质量。
    兰州工程总公司在推广这些先进经验当中，自己制造了钢筋冷轧机、冷拔机，并且想出用卷扬机代替冷拉机的办法。他们制造的冷轧机，比国家调拨的还要好，不仅能冷轧大规格的钢筋，同时还能冷轧小规格的钢筋。
