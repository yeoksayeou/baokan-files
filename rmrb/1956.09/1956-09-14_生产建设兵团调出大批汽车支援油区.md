The Production and Construction Corps transferred another 100 vehicles in early September to meet the growing needs of the Karamay oil region, to undertake the task of transporting various building materials.

As early as April this year, the transportation unit of the Production and Construction Corps transferred 80 vehicles to undertake tasks such as transporting water and materials in the Karamay area. When Karamay was confirmed as China's largest oil region and a decision was made to develop it, the transportation unit sent another batch of vehicles from within the customs to transport a large number of steel pipes, equipment and other building materials.

Most of the vehicles transferred this time are used to transport large seamless steel pipes ranging from twelve to thirteen meters in length. Each vehicle carries two pipes, weighing four to five tons, making loading and unloading very difficult. In order to solve this problem, the transportation unit transferred large trucks with larger carrying capacities and modified them to adapt to this special transportation task. A batch of vehicles has now been successfully modified and has been successively entering the oil region. (Production Frontline Newspaper)

    生产建设兵团调出大批汽车支援油区
    本报讯为了满足日益发展的克拉玛依油区的需要，生产建设兵团运输部队在9月上旬又调拨了一百辆汽车担任运输各种建筑材料的任务。
    生产建设兵团运输部队早在今年4月间，就调拨了八十辆汽车，担任克拉玛依地区运水、运料等任务。当克拉玛依已探明是我国最大的油区并决定建设的时候，运输部队又派了一批汽车从关内运进大批钢管、器材等建筑材料。
    这次调拨的汽车大部分是拉运长达十二到十三公尺的大型无缝钢管，每辆车拉运两根就有四到五吨重，装运起来非常困难。为了解决这个问题，运输部队便调拨了载重量较大的大卡车，并加以改装，使之能适应这种特殊的运输任务。现在已有一批车辆改装成功，并已陆续开进油区。（生产战线报社）
