    Xinhua News Agency report: In Tianjin, 799 brokers who lost their business conditions due to the disappearance of the free market have been assigned jobs in state-owned and joint state-private stores by the government.
    After being assigned to work, they began to exert their professional expertise. Zhang Baoxin and Chang Shoujing, who were assigned to work as salesmen in the joint state-private Gexin Hardware Store, actively used their old relationships to vigorously organize sources of goods because they had experience in operating hardware tools and plumbing equipment. As a result, the goods they managed increased from more than 400 to more than 1,000. Since Duan Shuhua became a salesman in the joint state-private Hongfu Bicycle Shop, his service attitude has been very good, and he has actively purchased scarce bicycle parts, so that the store maintains the proper quantity of goods, and the turnover has more than doubled than in the past. As a result, he was praised by customers and rewarded by the leadership.

    一批经纪人有了工作
    据新华社讯　天津市场上有七百九十九个因自由市场消失、失去经营条件的经纪人，由政府安排到国营和公私合营商店里工作。
    他们被安排工作以后，开始发挥了业务特长。被分配到公私合营革新五金商店担任业务员工作的张宝信和常守敬，因经营五金工具和水暖器材有经验，主动地利用他们旧有的关系，大力组织货源，使经营的商品由四百多种增加为一千多种。经纪人段树华自从担任公私合营宏孚自行车行的业务员以后，服务态度很好，并且积极采购货源较缺的自行车零件，使得商店保持着应有的商品数量，营业额也比过去增加一倍多。他因此受到顾客的表扬和领导部门的奖励。
