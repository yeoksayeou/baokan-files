Xinhua News Agency Report:
A rare Bauhinia championii with high economic value has been discovered in Hainan Island and the Leizhou Peninsula. The roots of Bauhinia championii contain approximately 40% tannin, which is higher than the tannin content of mangroves. Tannin can be used to make tannin extract for tanning leather.

The discovered production areas of Bauhinia championii include Wenchang and Qiongshan counties in Hainan Island, and Xuwen county in the Leizhou Peninsula. Bauhinia championii grows in mountains, fields, villages, and sparse forests, and is also cultivated by farmers (mostly intercropped with sweet potatoes, etc.). According to preliminary estimates, Xuwen County alone has more than 400,000 wild and cultivated Bauhinia championii plants. In the past, fishermen in these areas used the rhizomes of Bauhinia championii to boil a liquid for tanning and dyeing fishing nets, which made the nets durable.

Currently, the Guangdong Provincial Department of Forestry is sending people to the production areas for further investigation and research.

    罕见的植物——羊蹄藤
    据新华社讯　在海南岛和雷州半岛一带，发现了一种罕见的经济价值很高的羊蹄藤。羊蹄藤根部所含的单宁约达40％，比红树的含单宁量还要高。单宁可以制成栲胶，供鞣制皮革用。
    已发现的羊蹄藤产地，有海南岛的文昌、琼山和雷州半岛的徐闻等县。羊蹄藤生长在山野、村边和疏林下，也有农民栽培的（大多和甘薯等混种）。据初步估计，单是徐闻县野生和栽培的羊蹄藤就有四十多万株。这些地区的渔民过去就利用羊蹄藤块根熬出液汁，鞣染渔网，可以使渔网经久耐用。    现在，广东省林业厅正派人到产地作进一步的调查研究。
