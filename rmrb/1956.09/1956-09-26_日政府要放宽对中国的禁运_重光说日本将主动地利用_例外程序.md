Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 25th: Japanese Foreign Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu said at a cabinet meeting today that, seeing that Western European countries are flexibly using the "special approval system" and that trade with China has developed somewhat, the Japanese government will also make further efforts to actively export embargoed materials to China.

Shigemitsu reported at the cabinet meeting that after the Japanese government negotiated with relevant countries to relax the embargo restrictions on trade with China, it believed that it was confident to relax the export special approval system of the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM) and the China Committee (CHINCOM) in Paris to a certain extent, especially relaxing the post-approval method. He said that after exploring the opinions of the relevant countries and their attitudes towards trade with China, it has become clear that Japan can more actively utilize the "exception procedure." He also said that sometimes the best way is to export first and then ask COCOM for approval afterwards.

Japanese Minister of International Trade and Industry Tanzan Ishibashi announced to reporters after the cabinet meeting that the Japanese government will handle trade with China according to Shigemitsu's proposal. He said that the relaxation of the special approval system has become possible. He explained that due to the United States, it is still not possible to hope for a large relaxation of the embargo restrictions, but it can be gradually relaxed.

According to the "Mainichi Shimbun," the Japanese government's adoption of this new trade policy is the result of strong calls from Japanese businessmen who are keen on trade. Japanese trade representatives recently issued a statement pointing out that there is now a global trend of disregarding embargo restrictions. They demanded that the Japanese government hurry up and catch up with this trend.

    日政府要放宽对中国的禁运
    重光说日本将主动地利用“例外程序”
    新华社25日讯　东京消息：日本外务相重光葵今天在内阁会议上说，看到西欧国家灵活运用“特别批准制度”而同中国的贸易有所发展，日本政府也要作进一步努力，积极向中国输出禁运物资。
    重光在内阁会议上报告说，日本政府同有关国家谈判了放宽对中国贸易的禁运限制以后，认为已经有把握在某种程度上放宽巴黎统筹委员会和巴黎对华贸易管制国际委员会的出口特别批准制度，特别是放宽事后批准办法。他说，在探询了各有关国家的意见和它们对同中国贸易的态度以后，这件事情已经清楚起来，就是日本可以更主动地利用“例外程序”。他又说，有时最好的方法就是先出口事后再要求巴黎统筹委员会批准。
    日本通商产业相石桥湛山在内阁会议后向新闻记者宣布，日本政府将根据重光的建议处理对华贸易。他说，特别批准制度的放宽已经成为可能的了。他说明，由于美国的缘故，还不能希望大大放宽禁运限制，但是，可以逐渐地放宽。
    据“每日新闻”报道，日本政府采取这个新的贸易政策是由于热心于贸易的日本商人的强烈呼吁的结果。日本贸易界人士最近曾经发表声明指出，现在全世界有着一种漠视禁运限制的趋势。他们要求日本政府赶紧赶上这个趋势。
