Xinhua News Agency, Paris, September 12th: The Franco-Asian Chamber of Commerce, a French business organization, issued a report on September 10th stating that the economic boycott of Egypt by Britain and France has not achieved the expected results and is instead benefiting Japan's entry into the Middle Eastern market. The report pointed out that after Egyptian deposits in pounds sterling were frozen, countries such as China, India, Saudi Arabia, and Japan have continued to trade with Egypt, bypassing the pound. The report, after noting that Japan is currently resuming its trade activities in the Middle East, stated: "Undoubtedly, the current situation is beneficial to our rivals and will be particularly fully exploited by Japan."

    法亚商会承认
    对埃经济抵制不利于英法
    据新华社12日讯　巴黎消息：法国企业界的组织法亚商会9月10日发表一个报告说，英法两国对埃及进行的经济抵制并没有收到预期的效果，反而有利于日本打入中东市场。这个报告指出，在埃及的英镑存款被冻结以后，中国、印度、沙特阿拉伯和日本等国都在撇开英镑的基础上同埃及继续进行贸易。报告说，在指出日本目前正在恢复在中东的贸易活动以后说：“无疑的，目前的形势有利于我们的敌手，而且将特别被日本充分利用”。
