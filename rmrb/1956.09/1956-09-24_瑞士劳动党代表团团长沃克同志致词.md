Dear Comrades!

	Please allow me, on behalf of the Swiss Labor Party, to extend the warmest brotherly greetings to the delegates of this congress and to all comrades of your party. Please also allow me to tell you that everything we have seen so far on the streets and in the enterprises of this glorious city of Beijing, as well as at this congress, has left a very deep impression on us. All this convinces us that the Chinese people are not only hardworking and humble, but also intelligent and capable. Therefore, there is no doubt that your party and people will be able to complete the tasks stipulated in the Second Five-Year Plan, and will be able to realize socialism on the vast land of your republic.

	As for us, the Swiss communists, we live in a small country that is not only small in land area but also has a small population. This small country is still under the rule of capitalists, and if it were not for the diligence and ability of its people, it would not be able to survive. Switzerland has to process raw materials imported from abroad and then sell the products made through precise labor to foreign countries.

	Our party believes that its main task is to defend the economic and political interests of the working people, to safeguard national independence, to guarantee the country's neutrality, to eliminate the rule of capitalists, and to establish a true democratic order in our own country.

	The reason why we want to defend our country's neutrality is that in the current situation and in the current balance of international forces, maintaining neutrality is a concrete contribution to maintaining peace. But national neutrality is not equal to party neutrality. Just as the bourgeoisie does not conceal its belonging to the world capitalist camp, we also do not conceal that we belong to the world socialist camp.

	Today, after the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the bourgeoisie is making every effort to create chaos within the working class and to divert our party from proletarian internationalism. The bourgeoisie is intensifying its lies and slanders against the Soviet Union, and once again declares that Marxism has gone bankrupt. However, the resolutions of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union have precisely confirmed the correctness of the teachings of Marx and Lenin; these resolutions have confirmed this more than ever before. Nothing and no one can separate us from these teachings.

	Proletarian internationalism, the unity of proletarians and communists all over the world, is an integral part of Marxism-Leninism. Of course, every country, according to its specific conditions and the balance of various forces within the country, can adopt its own paths, methods and ways to socialism. But without forming an unbreakable friendship with the entire socialist camp, especially with the Soviet Union, there can be no path to socialism.

	Comrades!

	The Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China will have a great international impact. For us, we will certainly draw valuable lessons from your discussions based on the principles of Marxism-Leninism. These discussions are simple, profound, appropriate, modest, and have many original and educational things for communist and workers' parties in all countries.

	The Swiss Labor Party pays tribute to its great fraternal party, the Communist Party of China! Pays tribute to the great Chinese people! It congratulates the Chinese people on the achievements they have already made in socialist construction, and wishes them a speedy realization of the tasks decided by this congress in a peaceful environment.

	Long live the glorious Communist Party of China!

	Long live the brotherly solidarity of communist and workers' parties all over the world! (Attached picture)

### 瑞士劳动党代表团团长沃克同志致词

    瑞士劳动党代表团团长沃克同志致词亲爱的同志们！
    请允许我代表瑞士劳动党向这次大会的代表们和你们全党的同志们致以最热烈的兄弟般的敬礼。也请允许我告诉你们，直到目前，我们在北京这个光辉的城市的街道上和企业中，以及在这次大会上所见到的一切，都给我们留下了一个非常深刻的印象。这一切使得我们深信：中国人民不仅是勤劳和谦逊的，而且也是聪明和能干的。因此毫无疑问，你们的党和人民一定能够完成第二个五年计划所规定的任务，一定能够在你们共和国辽阔的土地上实现社会主义。
    至于我们瑞士共产党人，我们生活在一个不仅土地小而且人口也少的小的国家里。这个小的国家，至今还处于资本家的统治之下，如果不是由于它的人民的勤劳和能干，它就会无法生存下去。瑞士不得不用国外进口的原料进行加工，然后把经过精密劳动所制成的产品销售到国外去。
    我们的党认为它的主要任务，就是要捍卫劳动人民的经济和政治利益，保障民族独立，保证国家的中立，消灭资本家的统治，并在自己的国土上建立真正的民主秩序。
    我们所以要保卫我们国家的中立，那是因为在目前的形势下和在当前国际力量的对比中，保持中立就是对维护和平的一种具体贡献。但是国家的中立并不等于是党的中立。正像资产阶级并不掩饰它自己属于世界资本主义阵营一样，我们也更不掩饰我们是属于世界社会主义阵营的。
    在苏联共产党第二十次代表大会以后的今天，资产阶级正竭力企图在工人阶级内部制造混乱，并使我们的党离开无产阶级的国际主义。资产阶级加强他们制造谎言和进行诽谤的勾当以反对苏联，又一次宣布马克思主义已经破产。但是苏联共产党第二十次代表大会的决议，却正好证实了马克思和列宁教导的正确；这些决议比过去任何时候都更证实了这一点。没有任何事物也没有任何人能够使我们离开这种教导。
    无产阶级的国际主义、全世界无产者和共产党人的团结，是马克思列宁主义不可分割的组成部分。当然，每一个国家，根据自己的具体条件和国内各种力量的对比，可以采取各自走向社会主义的道路、方法和方式。但是如果不和整个社会主义阵营首先是和苏联结成牢不可破的友谊，那就不可能有可以通向社会主义的道路。
    同志们！
    中国共产党第八次全国代表大会将在国际上获得巨大的影响。对我们来说，我们一定会从你们基于马克思列宁主义原则的讨论中吸取宝贵的教益。这些讨论是朴实的，深刻的，恰当的，虚心的，其中有着许多独创性的和对各国共产党和工人党来说都是具有教育意义的东西。
    瑞士劳动党向它伟大的兄弟党，中国共产党致敬！向伟大的中国人民致敬！它庆贺中国人民在社会主义建设中已经取得的成就，并祝他们在和平环境中迅速实现这次大会所决定的任务。
    光荣的中国共产党万岁！
    全世界共产党和工人党的兄弟般的团结万岁！（附图片）
