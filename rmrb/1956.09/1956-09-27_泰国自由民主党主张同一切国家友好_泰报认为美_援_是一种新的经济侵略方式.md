Xinhua News Agency, September 26th, Bangkok Dispatch: Thai Liberal Democratic Party Member of Parliament, Nai Ari Taninayok, stated on September 20th, while explaining his party's foreign policy, that the Liberal Democratic Party supports China's entry into the United Nations, because according to international law, the Beijing government is the true government of the Chinese people. He believes that China's entry into the United Nations is only a matter of time.

This Thai Member of Parliament said at a press conference that the Liberal Democratic Party's foreign policy is to develop Thailand's diplomatic relations with all countries as broadly as possible, to follow the principles of the United Nations, and to cooperate with all countries to maintain lasting world peace.

Nai Ari believes that according to Thailand's conditions, Thailand should implement a Swiss-style neutral policy. The Liberal Democratic Party believes that the presence of the U.S. Military Advisory Group in Thailand is unnecessary, and if it has the opportunity to govern, it will refuse to allow the U.S. Military Advisory Group to remain in Thailand.

Xinhua News Agency, September 26th, Bangkok Dispatch: The Thai newspaper "Eternal News" published an editorial on September 21st entitled "Self-Reliance is Better," stating that although the United States has given Thailand a total of more than 99.9 million US dollars (approximately 2 billion baht) in economic "aid" over the past six years, this is not as much as the losses suffered by Thailand in "assisting" the United States during the Korean War. Thailand lost more than 3 billion baht in rubber sales revenue alone.

"Eternal News" pointed out that the United States requires recipient countries to pay counterpart funds, which is one of the attached conditions. The newspaper pointed out that the aid from China and the Soviet Union does not have any conditions to restrict other countries.

"Picture News" said in an editorial on the same day that the U.S. side said that this method of "aid" using unilaterally determined prices to promote surplus materials is a "new and special way." Indeed, in terms of new economic aggression methods, this is indeed a "new and special way," and at the same time, it has gradually turned those countries that accept this special form of "aid" from independent countries into colonies.

    泰国自由民主党主张同一切国家友好
    泰报认为美“援”是一种新的经济侵略方式
    据新华社26日讯　曼谷消息：泰国自由民主党议员乃阿里·丹的域差军9月20日在说明他的党的对外政策的时候说，自由民主党支持中国进入联合国，因为按照国际法，北京政府才是中国人民真正的政府。他认为，中国进入联合国只是时间迟早的问题。
    这位泰国议员在记者招待会上说，自由民主党的外交政策是要尽可能广泛地发展泰国同一切国家的外交关系，遵循联合国的原则，同一切国家合作维护世界的持久和平。
    乃阿里认为，按照泰国的条件，泰国应当实行瑞士式的中立政策。自由民主党认为，美国军事顾问团驻扎在泰国是不必要的，如果有机会执政，它将拒绝让美国军事顾问团留驻泰国。
    据新华社26日讯　曼谷消息：泰国“永恒报”9月21日以“自助更好”为题发表社论说，虽然美国在过去六年间一共给了泰国九千九百九十多万美元（约合泰币二十亿铢）的经济“援助”，但这却比不上泰国在朝鲜战争中“援助”美国所遭受的损失。泰国仅在出售橡胶收入一项就损失了三十亿铢以上。
    “永恒报”指出，美国要求受“援”国支付对等基金，这是附带条件之一。这家报纸指出，中苏两国的援助并没有任何条件束缚别国。
    “图画新闻”在同一天的社论中说，美国方面说它这种用单方面确定价格推销剩余物资的办法的“援助”方式是一种“新的和特别的方式”，的确，在新的经济侵略方法上，这的确是一种“新的和特别的方式”，同时它已经使得那些接受这种特别方式“援助”的国家由独立国家地位逐渐变为殖民地。
