What Good is Frequent Transfers?
　　Xuli
　　The Northwest No. 3 State-owned Cotton Mill has had four factory directors and two Party committee secretaries transferred away in the three years since its establishment. The leading cadres here don't last long. During the anti-waste campaign last year, it was discovered that the factory had serious waste, weak administrative leadership, and poor Party work. The factory director and Party committee secretary were both transferred away. This year, after the campaign against right-leaning conservatism and the campaign to improve product quality, the quality continued to decline, and the only factory director was sent to study.
　　Cadres below the factory level are either considered "talented but lacking in virtue" or "virtuous but lacking in talent," so their job titles remain uncertain. Currently, only three people have been formally appointed as section chiefs, and only two have been formally appointed as workshop directors. The heads of other sections and workshops are either deputies or acting heads.
　　This suggests that the leadership of the Northwest Textile Administration Bureau and the Northwest No. 3 State-owned Cotton Mill are extremely cautious about cadre issues. With such careful selection and arrangement, the work should be making significant progress.
　　However, this is not the case. Taking production in recent months as an example: around March, the factory's "improve quality, oppose conservative thinking" campaign was in full swing, but the quality declined sharply. The standard yarn rate dropped from over 90% in February to below 50% in March, and continued to decline to below 25% in April. It only began to turn around in May. But just as one wave subsided, another rose. The first-class fabric rate was above 99% in May, dropped to below 98.5% in June, and continued to decline to below 96% in July, and has not yet turned around. Currently, the yarn and fabric machine breakage rates and the fabric machine downtime rates are increasing, and the confusion in production is increasing rather than decreasing.
　　I remember this fable:
　　A monkey, a goat, a donkey, and a bear were holding a concert, and their violin playing was terribly unpleasant, "yi a yi a".
　　The monkey said, "Wait a minute, we should sit face to face."
　　They changed seats, but it still sounded bad.
　　The donkey said, "Stop, it would sound better if everyone sat in a row."
　　They changed seats, but it still didn't sound good.
　　A nightingale flew over and said, "If you want to play well, you have to learn how to play the violin. What good is it to just change seats!"
　　That's right! To improve production, you have to learn how to lead production. Leading cadres at all levels should not only pay attention to checking the work of leading comrades in factories and mines, praising achievements, and pointing out shortcomings, but also urge and help them to study their profession and correct their mistakes. If detailed organizational education work is not carried out, and you only transfer grassroots leaders back and forth, what good will it do?

    频频调动何济于事
    叙理
    西北国棉三厂建厂三年来被调走了四个厂长，两个党委书记。这里的领导干部都是做不长的。去年反浪费运动中，发现这个厂的浪费现象很严重，行政领导薄弱，党的工作也做得很差，厂长和党委书记就一齐给调走了。今年反对右倾保守，开展提高产品质量运动以后，质量还是不断下降，唯一的一个厂长就被送去学习了。
    厂级以下的干部，不是被认为“有才缺德”，就是被认为“有德才不足”，所以职位名称悬而不定。目前，正式被任命为科长的，只有三人；正式被任命为车间主任的，只有两人；其他科室和车间的负责人，不是副职就是代理。
    这样说来，西北纺织管理局和西北国棉三厂的领导上，在干部问题上是极端慎重的了；经过这样的挑选，安排，工作应该很有起色了。
    但是，情况并不是这样，举最近几个月的生产为例：3月前后，厂里的“提高质量，反对保守思想”运动是搞得热火朝天，质量却直线下降，棉纱标准品率，2月份90％以上，3月份跌到50％以下，4月份继续下降至25％以下，5月份才开始扭转。但是一波才平，一波又起，棉布上等品率，5月份为99％以上，6月份下降为98.5％以下，7月份继续下降到96％以下，现在仍未见扭转。目前纱、布机断头率及布机的停台率都在增加，生产上的混乱情况有增无减。
    记得有这么一段寓言：
    猴子、山羊、驴子和熊开音乐会，它们拉提琴“衣啊衣啊”难听极了。
    猴子说“等一等，我们应该面对面坐才对。”
    它们换了座位，还是拉得不好听。
    驴子说：“停一停，大家坐成一排才好听。”
    它们换了座位，可是还是不好听。
    黄莺飞来说：“你们要拉得好听，得学会拉提琴的方法啊，光换座位有什么用！”
    对啊！要搞好生产，就得学会领导生产。各级领导干部，不仅要经常注意检查厂矿领导同志的工作，表扬成绩，指出缺点，而且要督促和帮助他们学习业务，改正错误。如果不进行细致的组织教育工作，只管把基层领导人员换来换去，又有什么用呢？
