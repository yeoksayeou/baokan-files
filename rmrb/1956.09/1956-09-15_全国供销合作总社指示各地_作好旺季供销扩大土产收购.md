Xinhua News Agency, 13th. The All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives issued instructions to local supply and marketing cooperatives on the 12th regarding preparations for the autumn peak season. After analyzing the basic situation and problems of the current rural market, the instructions pointed out that the central task of this year's autumn peak season is to further invigorate the rural market and strengthen the ties between socialist commerce and the masses, actively give play to the role of various rural commercial organizations, thereby expanding purchasing and marketing operations to meet the purchasing and marketing needs of the broad masses of peasants, and help disaster areas do a good job in production to overcome famine.

The instructions said that in terms of procurement, local supply and marketing cooperatives should closely cooperate with agricultural cooperatives' sideline production, actively open up product sales channels, and expand the purchase of small native products and waste products. All commodities operated by supply and marketing cooperatives, or assigned to state-owned commercial operations but entrusted to supply and marketing cooperatives for purchase, as well as commodities that no one purchases but have sales channels, should be purchased; for those with unclear sales channels, sales channels should be actively sought. In order to increase farmers' income and reduce losses, for small native products that farmers can process and package themselves, farmers should be guided to do it themselves as much as possible. In areas where procurement organizations are unsound and personnel are insufficient, in addition to adjusting and improving organizations and enriching personnel, small merchants and peddlers should also be widely organized to operate or sell on commission; appropriate consideration should be given to them in terms of purchase and sales price differences and handling fees, in order to give full play to their enthusiasm.

In terms of supply work, the instructions call for actively improving the organization of goods sources to ensure that commodities are suitable and supplied in a timely manner. To this end, local supply and marketing departments, in addition to continuing to do a good job in investigating and studying people's needs and overcoming blind purchasing, must also cooperate closely with state-owned commerce, implement the method of selecting goods from the bottom up, and stop the method of dispatching goods from the top down (except for unified sales and materials distributed uniformly by the state).

The instructions pointed out that cooperating with agricultural cooperatives and farmers in disaster areas, especially severely affected areas, to develop sideline production is an important link in helping them do a good job in production for self-rescue. Local supply and marketing cooperatives should promptly supply the raw materials and tools needed by the masses in disaster areas for sideline production, and, in accordance with the principle of "no profit, no loss," do a good job in the purchase and sale of sideline products in disaster areas; at the same time, the supply and marketing cooperatives in disaster areas should also do a good job in the supply and purchase of building materials and substitute foods to help the people in these areas rebuild their homes and solve the difficulties of insufficient food. In addition to this, local supply and marketing cooperatives should also ensure the timely supply of small farm tools for autumn plowing and autumn planting.

The instructions finally said that local supply and marketing leading departments must also attach importance to giving play to the active role played by small merchants and peddlers in purchasing, supplying, and short-distance transportation, which has a great relationship with invigorating the peak season market. Therefore, local supply and marketing cooperatives should help them expand their operations in a planned way to meet the needs of the market; the problem of excessively strict and rigid restrictions on the purchasing and marketing activities of small merchants and peddlers must be resolved quickly.

    全国供销合作总社指示各地
    作好旺季供销扩大土产收购
    新华社13日讯　中华全国供销合作总社12日向各地供销合作社发出关于作好秋后旺季工作的指示。指示在分析了当前农村市场的基本情况和问题后，指出今年秋后旺季的中心任务是：进一步活跃农村市场和密切社会主义商业同群众的联系，积极发挥农村各种商业组织的作用，从而扩大购销业务以满足广大农民的购销要求，并且帮助灾区做好生产度荒工作。
    指示说，在采购业务方面，各地供销社应密切配合农业社的副业生产，积极开拓产品销路并扩大对小土产和废品的收购。凡由供销社经营的或者划归国营商业经营而委托供销社代购的、以及无人收购但有销路的商品，都要收购起来；销路不明的，应积极寻找销路。为增加农民收入和减少损耗，对凡是农民能够自行加工整装的小土产品，应尽量指导农民自己进行。在采购机构不健全、人员不充足的地区，除要调整和健全机构充实人员外，还应广泛组织小商、小贩经营或代销；在购销差价上和手续费方面要适当予以照顾，以充分发挥他们的积极性。
    在供应工作方面，指示要求积极改进货源的组织工作，使商品对路，供应及时。为此，各地供销部门除继续作好对人民需要的调查研究，克服盲目进货外，还必须与国营商业密切配合，贯彻由下而上选货的办法，停止由上而下派货的办法（统销和国家统一分配的物资除外）。
    指示指出，配合灾区特别是重灾区的农业社和农民发展副业生产，是帮助他们搞好生产自救的重要环节。各地供销社应及时供应灾区群众进行副业生产所需的原料和工具，并且根据“不赔不赚”的原则，搞好灾区副业产品的购、销工作；同时，灾区的供销社还要做好建筑材料和代食品的供应和采购工作，以帮助这些地区的人民重建家园和解决粮食不足的困难。除此以外，各地供销社还要保证秋耕秋种小农具的及时供应。
    指示最后说，各地供销领导部门还必需重视发挥小商小贩在收购、供应和短途运输中所起的积极作用，这种作用对活跃旺季市场有很大关系。因此各地供销社要有计划地帮助他们扩大经营，来适应市场的购销需要；当前对小商小贩的购销活动限制过严过死的问题必需很快解决。
