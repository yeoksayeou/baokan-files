Experiences and Lessons Learned from Achieving Advanced Agricultural Cooperativization in Hebei
Comrade Lin Tie's Speech

I fully agree with Chairman Mao's opening address, and I fully agree with the Political Report of the Central Committee, the Report on the Revision of the Party Constitution and the Report containing the Suggestions for the Second Five-Year Plan.

Now, I would like to talk about the problems and lessons learned in the work of Hebei Province after the realization of advanced agricultural cooperativization.

In the struggle of socialist revolution, solving the peasant problem is an exceptionally arduous task. "The serious problem is the education of the peasants." Past experience has proven that as long as our Party points out the correct path for the peasants, and has correct policies and correct working methods, this serious problem can be successfully solved. The Party organization in Hebei Province, in accordance with the path of cooperativization pointed out by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao for the peasants, implemented the central government's policies of voluntary mutual benefit and uniting with the middle peasants, and used the working method of the mass line, and this spring has achieved advanced cooperativization, completing the socialist transformation of agriculture. Of the 8,240,000 peasant households in the province, 99.57 percent have joined advanced cooperatives. From then on, the small-peasant economy, which was linked to poverty, has become a thing of the past; collectivized agriculture has created a broad road for the socialist happy life of the peasants.

After the realization of agricultural cooperativization, our task is to develop production, increase the income of cooperative members, consolidate new relations of production, and consolidate the victory of socialist transformation. The policy we have adopted to achieve this task is comprehensive planning, strengthening leadership, actively and boldly mobilizing the masses, and launching an agricultural production increase campaign. In the new situation of realizing advanced cooperativization, the past experience of leading individual peasants and a part of small-scale semi-socialist cooperatives in production is no longer sufficient. If we fail to see that the advanced cooperativization movement has liberated the productive forces from the relations of individual production, greatly enhancing the productive enthusiasm of the broad masses of peasants, and opening up a broad road for the continuous upsurge of agricultural production, we will inevitably commit the tendency of conservatism. The facts are also like this. Some comrades did not sufficiently recognize the situation of the rapid and fierce cooperative movement and the large-scale production increase movement being closely combined and promoting each other, and underestimated the huge potential for production increase created and tapped by the cooperative movement, and committed a conservative deviation, and the leadership of production lagged behind the possibilities of objective conditions and the demands of the masses. We criticized and corrected this deviation. We adopted the methods of formulating plans, finding ways to increase production, and deeply mobilizing the masses, and launched a production movement with the main content of building water conservancy projects, increasing the application of fertilizers, promoting high-yield crops, and carrying out lowland transformation. Within half a year, the province opened canals and dug wells that could expand the irrigated area by 17 million mu, which is equivalent to double the original paddy fields in our province; the amount of fertilizer applied in the province exceeded more than double that of last year. Although the wheat harvest this year was reduced due to rain disasters, the average yield per unit area still increased by 15.46 percent compared to last year, and the total output increased by 600 million jin compared to last year. The Tangshan Special Zone, which was not affected by the flood, is expected to increase its total grain crop output by 19.24 percent compared to last year, the Chengde Special Zone by 15.38 percent, and the Zhangjiakou Special Zone by 10.45 percent. These facts show the superiority of advanced cooperatives, and also powerfully consolidate the cooperatives. From this, it should be affirmed that the policy and practice of taking active leadership in the production increase movement and boldly mobilizing the masses is an important experience.

Here, I would like to emphasize that, in the first year after the realization of cooperativization, while relying on the cooperatives to achieve important achievements in production, we also generated some shortcomings and errors in our work. Naturally, these shortcomings and errors were produced in the process of the unprecedented cooperative movement and production increase movement moving forward. Some of these shortcomings and errors were difficult to avoid due to lack of experience, but some could have been avoided. Summarizing the experiences and lessons of this year will be of great benefit to improving future work.

I feel that the experiences and lessons in the following key issues are worth noting.

First, on the issue of developing production, it is not only important to understand that guaranteeing production increase is the foundation for consolidating cooperatives, but more importantly, how to lead cooperatives to develop production.

On this issue, the policy of taking active leadership and boldly mobilizing the masses is correct; however, in the face of the high tide of cooperativization and production, we once developed a sense of impatience, and stipulated excessively high production increase targets, planning to increase grain production by 36.39 percent in one year this year compared to the past. This was because we had an urgent desire to strive to resolve the province's grain self-sufficiency as soon as possible, but we overestimated the favorable conditions and speed of resolving the grain problem; we underestimated or even ignored the fact that agricultural production is still largely restricted by natural conditions and production conditions. If the plan is too large and deviates from reality, its impact cannot but be reflected first and directly in the measures taken to achieve this plan, and reflected in the relationship between the state and the cooperatives.

In order to achieve the production increase plan, we actively researched and promoted the main production increase measures under the conditions of Hebei. This is water conservancy development (mainly well-digging), increasing fertilizer application, promoting close planting, growing more high-yield crops, intensive cultivation, and so on. The achievements and effects of promoting these measures are significant, but some problems have also occurred in their implementation. For example, in well-digging, many defective products appeared because of the pursuit of speed; close planting produced the phenomenon of leaving too many seedlings regardless of soil quality, land fertility, fertilizer and other conditions, and many empty corn stalks appeared in some places as a result. Only emphasizing corn, sweet potatoes and rice as high-yield crops, and requiring the planting area of corn and sweet potatoes to be too large, so that many places squeezed out crops suitable for local conditions, violating the principle of adapting to local conditions. These shortcomings are related to the excessively high production increase targets.

After discovering the above problems, especially the problem of excessively high production increase targets, we gradually corrected them with the help of the Central Committee. However, the experiences and lessons it left us are important.

1.  Subjective desires must be based on objective conditions, and the observation and analysis of conditions must be comprehensive; overestimating difficult conditions will certainly lead to conservative tendencies, but overestimating favorable conditions will cause the mind to become heated. Therefore, only by correctly understanding subjective and objective conditions and combining needs and possibilities can things be done well.
2.  Conservative plans will naturally suppress the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, so the plan should be advanced and active; but the facts tell us that rash plans and the impact brought by such plans are also harmful to the enthusiasm of the masses and the establishment of confidence in production increase, therefore, the plan must be built on a completely reliable basis.
3.  Production must be planned, but it cannot be just that the upper level has a plan, regardless of the plan of the lower level, it must be a combination of upper and lower levels. The plan of the upper level should not be too detailed and too rigid, so that the lower level can be flexible, so that things can be done well.
4.  The promotion of technological reform should not be achieved in one step, but should be advanced step by step; it should not only be fast, but also good; actively promoting advanced experience must be combined with the experience of local farmers.

Second, on the issue of increasing the income of cooperative members, it is not only important to understand the serious significance of guaranteeing the increase of cooperative members' income for consolidating the cooperatives, but more importantly, to be able to take concrete measures in a timely manner in order to ensure the increase of cooperative members' income during distribution.

In this year's wheat harvest distribution in our province, 80 percent of the cooperatives achieved increased income for more than 90 percent of the cooperative members; according to the understanding of 276 cooperatives in Tangshan Special Zone that have already prepared pre-distribution plans for this year's autumn harvest distribution, 87.6 percent of the cooperatives can guarantee increased income for more than 90 percent of the cooperative members. Among those cooperatives that did not achieve increased income for more than 90 percent of the cooperative members, in addition to those affected by disasters, only a very small number had poor production. Most of them had increased production, but could not guarantee increased income for more cooperative members. The reasons for this are as follows:

(1) Because the cooperatives were newly established and the foundation was empty, the cadres were extremely prone to paying attention only to the need to increase public accumulation and expand reproduction, and lacked accounting in production investment and did not do what they could, and they had not yet considered the impact of this approach on the income of cooperative members. This phenomenon has been largely reversed after the vigorous implementation of the Central Committee's instructions on running cooperatives diligently and thriftily, but a small number have not reversed enough. An important method of implementing the spirit of running cooperatives diligently and thriftily is to "keep accounts," and from calculating income, calculating expenses (the income and expenses of the whole cooperative), and calculating distribution (the income of cooperative members), we can find out where the crux of the problem lies and where the way out lies.

(2) The quality of labor management and how well the principle of distribution according to work is implemented have a very important relationship to increasing the income of cooperative members. Some cooperatives reduced the income of some cooperative members because of wasted work in the cooperatives or unreasonable methods of recording work and calculating remuneration. In order to solve this problem, we vigorously promoted the three systems of labor quota, piece-rate remuneration, and contract work and output in labor management, which achieved no small results. However, because the cooperatives are large and the cadres still lack experience in the planned management of advanced cooperatives, many cooperatives still have different degrees of confusion in labor management. This complex and extremely important issue must be vigorously resolved in the future.

(3) Some cooperatives increased agricultural production but reduced sideline production, and after offsetting, the increase in income was not much. Sideline production occupies an important position in the income of farmers. The income from sideline production in rural areas of our province accounts for more than 20 percent of the total income, second only to the income from grain. Some cooperatives have increased agricultural production but decreased sideline production, mainly because we did not sufficiently recognize and implement the policy of diversified operations with grain and cotton production as the center. Later, we adopted comprehensive planning, supply and marketing support, both engaging in collective sideline production and encouraging cooperative members to develop sideline production that is conducive to decentralized management, and so on, before a situation of common upsurge in agriculture and sideline production appeared.

The Central Committee stipulates that cooperatives must distribute 60 to 70 percent of the total income to cooperative members in the next few years, and the expenses reserved for production costs, public accumulation fund, public welfare fund, agricultural tax, etc., must not exceed 30 to 40 percent. According to the survey of some cooperatives, this policy is in line with the current situation of the cooperatives. As long as production increases, this limit can not only ensure the increase of cooperative members' income, but also ensure the necessary production and operation of the cooperatives. Therefore, it has been deeply supported by cooperative members and has powerfully promoted the socialist production increase movement launched by the broad masses of cooperative members to increase production and increase income.

It should be pointed out that while paying attention to guaranteeing increased income for the majority of cooperative members, we cannot ignore the small number of people who have not increased their income. This includes the "five guarantees" households, people who have worked less due to illness or going out, some small vendors and the families of some primary school teachers, as well as some cooperative members who had too much land and less labor in the past. For the "five guarantees" households, the "five guarantees" method is implemented. For the remaining households, the methods we are currently taking are to develop diversified operations and help them develop family sideline production in order to increase income; at the same time, to provide subsidies to those who are truly in difficult circumstances, and to explain to those who are not in difficult circumstances, and encourage them to work more in the future to increase income.

Third, how large the scale of the cooperative is best is an important issue in the organizational construction of the cooperative, and it is also an important issue involving labor management and production distribution.

The experience of the first production year after cooperativization proves that, at present, in order to facilitate production and leadership, the scale of the cooperative should not be too large. According to the situation in Hebei Province, it is generally appropriate to have one cooperative per village; from the perspective of being conducive to developing production, if there are conditions and it is necessary, it is also possible to form a joint-village cooperative composed of adjacent villages on the basis of the voluntary of the masses. This is the policy we once put forward during the development of the cooperativization movement; however, because some comrades had a blind enthusiasm for the bigger the better, and the provincial party committee lacked strict control, many excessively large cooperatives were established. Now there are a total of 24,249 cooperatives in the province, of which joint-village and joint-township cooperatives account for 33.02 percent (cooperatives with more than 500 households to thousands of households account for 23 percent of the total number of cooperatives), one cooperative per village accounts for 64.56 percent, and several cooperatives per village account for 2.42 percent. The average number of households per cooperative in the province is 340 households, and the number of households included in joint-village and joint-township cooperatives accounts for more than 60 percent of the total number of cooperative members. Now it seems that those joint-village cooperatives that were organized out of voluntary cooperation to develop production, and are also led by cadres who are strong and experienced, generally do well. Many large cooperatives with several villages, dozens of villages, including thousands of households and thousands of households, have the following phenomena: production management is difficult, policies are difficult to implement correctly, cooperative cadres cannot work in depth, especially because the land ownership and income between villages are very different, and the objects of production and operation are different, so that the cooperative members in that village suddenly universally increase their income, and the cooperative members in this village cannot increase their income. Experience has proved that under the current conditions, several villages in one cooperative is not the direction of development.

In the case that many joint-village and joint-township cooperatives have been built in our province and have been running for one year, we have decided to adopt the policy of "actively helping to rectify" these joint-village and joint-township cooperatives. Help those cooperatives that have been doing well and have the conditions to do well and do even better; for those cooperatives that do not have the conditions to do well, such as not having the conditions to cooperate with each other to develop production, there are serious contradictions between the economic interests of the villages, and the cooperative members are not voluntary but are forced to merge, after full consultation, take appropriate steps such as jointly accounting cooperatives to gradually change to village cooperatives.

The victory of socialist transformation has solved the old contradictions, but new contradictions have also emerged. Solving new contradictions and consolidating the victory of socialist transformation requires us to make tremendous efforts. As mentioned above, the main contradictions faced by cooperatives, both inside and outside the cooperatives, are two: one is the contradiction between the collective and the individual (including the relationship between the state and the cooperative, and the relationship between the cooperative and the cooperative members); the other is the contradiction between the cooperative's requirements for production increase and objective conditions such as nature, financial resources, technology, and experience. In the past year, in the process of guiding cooperatives to solve these two contradictions, we have achieved successes and made mistakes. We gain experience in the process of constantly achieving success and overcoming shortcomings and errors. I would like to repeat that the most important of these experiences can be said to be: consult more with the masses (including lower-level organizations), and never forget to follow the mass line; be vigilant against subjectivism, and guard against the one-sidedness of guiding ideology.

On the basis of past experience, we are determined to make greater efforts to increase agricultural and sideline production, increase the income of cooperative members, and further consolidate the victory of agricultural socialist transformation.

At present, we are concentrating our efforts to complete the two important tasks before us. That is, in areas that have suffered serious floods, rely on cooperatives to carry out a production and disaster relief campaign to overcome the disaster; in non-disaster areas, guide cooperatives to do a good job in autumn harvest distribution. At the same time, through production and disaster relief and autumn harvest distribution work, further rectify and consolidate cooperatives, help them summarize experiences, solve problems such as labor management, distribution of sideline income, large cooperative problems, democratic management of cooperatives, and formulate next year's production plans, so as to prepare for next year's production increase movement.

What we never forget is that we are determined to concentrate our efforts to solve the fundamental problem of the comprehensive management of the Haihe River system in our province within a certain period of time, in order to eliminate the water disaster that is often pressing on the heads of the people of Hebei. Turning the water damage that destroys the labor results of millions of people into water conservancy is the fundamental problem of guaranteeing the annual increase in agricultural production in Hebei Province. In the process of doing so, we earnestly hope and firmly believe that we will receive strong support from the Central Committee and all relevant parties.

    河北实现高级农业合作化的经验教训
    林铁同志的发言
    我完全同意毛主席的开幕词，完全同意中央委员会的政治报告、修改党章的报告和第二个五年计划的建议的报告。
    现在，我来谈一下河北省在实现高级农业合作化以后工作中所发生的问题和经验教训。
    在社会主义革命的斗争中，解决农民问题，是一个异常艰巨的任务。“严重的问题在于教育农民”，过去的经验证明，只要我们党为农民指出的道路是正确的，而又有正确的政策和正确的工作方法，这个严重的问题就能够成功的解决。河北省党的组织，按照党中央和毛主席为农民所指出的合作化道路，执行了中央规定的自愿互利和团结中农的政策，运用群众路线的工作方法，已经在今年春季实现了高级合作化，完成了对农业的社会主义改造。在全省八百二十四万农户中，有百分之九十九点五七的农户参加了高级社。从此以后，和贫困相连的小农经济，已成为过去；集体化的农业，为农民的社会主义幸福生活开创了广阔的道路。
    实现农业合作化以后，我们的任务是发展生产、增加社员收入，巩固新的生产关系，巩固社会主义改造的胜利。我们为实现这个任务所采取的方针是全面规划，加强领导，积极放手发动群众，开展农业增产运动。在实现了高级合作化的新的形势下，过去领导个体农民和一部分小型的半社会主义合作社进行生产的经验，已经不够了。如果看不到高级合作化运动已经从个体生产关系下解放了劳动力，极大地提高了广大农民的生产积极性，展开了农业生产不断高涨的宽广道路，势必犯保守主义的倾向。事实也是这样。有些同志对于迅速猛烈的合作化运动和大规模的增产运动密切结合、互相推动的形势认识不够，对于合作化运动所创造所发掘的巨大的增产潜力估计不足，犯了保守主义的偏向，对生产的领导，落在客观条件的可能性和群众要求的后面。我们批判和纠正了这种偏向。采取订计划、找增产门路、深入发动群众的办法，掀起了以兴修水利、增施肥料、推广高产作物、进行洼地改造为主要内容的生产运动。全省半年内，开渠、打井可扩大水浇地一千七百万亩，相当我省原有水田的一倍；全省所施肥料超过去年一倍以上。今年小麦收成虽然因雨灾减产，但平均单位面积产量，仍比去年提高了百分之十五点四六，总产量比去年多了六亿斤。未遭受水灾的唐山专区，全年粮食作物总产量预计比去年增产百分之十九点二四，承德专区增产百分之十五点三八，张家口专区增产百分之十点四五。这些事实显示了高级合作社的优越性，也有力地巩固了合作社。由此应该肯定，对增产运动采取积极领导、放手发动群众的方针和作法，是一条重要的经验。
    在这里，我愿意着重谈一下，在实现合作化后第一年的工作中，在依靠合作社取得生产上的重要成绩的同时，我们在工作上产生的某些缺点和错误。自然，这些缺点和错误是在规模空前的合作化运动与增产运动前进中产生的。其中有些缺点和错误，由于经验不足，是难以避免的，但有一些则是可以避免的。总结这一年的经验教训，对改进今后的工作会有很大好处。
    我感到在以下几个主要问题上的经验教训，值得注意。
    第一，在发展生产的问题上不仅在于懂得保证增产是巩固合作社的基础，更重要的是怎样领导合作社发展生产。
    在这个问题上，采取积极领导、放手发动群众的方针是对的；但是在合作化和生产高潮面前，我们一度产生了急躁情绪，规定了过高的增产指标，计划把粮食产量在今年一年内比过去提高百分之三十六点三九。这是由于我们有争取尽早解决本省粮食自给的迫切愿望，但对解决粮食问题的有利条件和速度，作了过高的估计；对于目前农业生产在很大程度上仍然受自然条件和生产条件的限制，估计不足甚至忽视了。计划过大，脱离实际，它的影响就不能不首先和直接反映在为实现这个计划而采取的措施上，反映在国家和合作社的关系上。
    为实现增产计划，我们积极地研究、推行了在河北情况下的主要的增产措施。这就是开发水利（主要是打井）、增施肥料、推广密植、多种高产作物、精耕细作等等。推行这些措施的成绩和效果是显著的，但在执行中也发生了一些问题。比如打井，就因为求快而出现不少废品；密植就产生不管土质、地力、肥料等条件而留苗过密的现象，有些地方的玉米就因此出现许多空棵。只强调玉米、白薯和稻谷这三项作物为高产作物，要求玉米、白薯种植面积太大，以致不少地方挤掉适于当地条件种植的作物，违背了因地制宜的原则。这些缺点是和增产指标过高有关联的。
    在发现以上这些问题之后，特别是增产指标过高的问题，在中央的帮助下，逐步纠正了。但它留给我们的经验教训却是重要的。
    一、主观的愿望要以客观的条件作基础，而观察分析条件必须全面；对困难的条件估计过分，固然易犯保守倾向，但对有利条件作过高的估计，脑子就会发热。因此，正确的认识主客观条件，把需要和可能结合起来，才能将事情办好。
    二、保守的计划自然会压抑群众的积极性和创造性，因此计划应该是先进的，积极的；但事实告诉说，冒进的计划和由这样的计划带来的影响，也有害于群众的积极性和树立增产信心，因此，计划又必须建筑在完全可靠的基础上。
    三、生产必须有计划，但不能只是上边有计划，不管下边的计划，要上下结合。上边的计划不可太细太死，要使下边能够机动，才好办事。
    四、推行技术改革不能是一步求成，而应是逐步前进；不能只要快，而且还要好；积极推广先进经验，必须和当地农民的经验相结合。
    第二，在增加社员收入的问题上，不仅要懂得保证增加社员收入对于巩固社的严重意义，但更重要的是能及时采取具体措施，以便保证在分配时增加社员收入。
    今年我省麦收分配，有百分之八十的社达到了百分之九十以上的社员增加收入；今年的秋收分配，根据唐山专区已经作好预分方案的二百七十六个社的了解，百分之八十七点六的社能够保证百分之九十以上的社员增加收入。在这些没有达到百分之九十以上社员增加收入的社里，除受灾者外，由于生产不好的是极少数。多数是增产了，但却不能保证更多的社员增加收入，其原因有以下几点：
      （一）由于合作社初建，底子空，干部极易产生只注意增加公共积累和扩大再生产的需要，在生产投资上缺乏核算和不量力而为，他们还没有考虑到这种作法对社员收入的影响。这种现象，在大力贯彻中央勤俭办社的指示后，大都得到彻底扭转，但少数扭转不够。贯彻勤俭办社精神的一个重要的方法是“算账”，从算收入、算开支（全社的收入、开支）、算分配（社员收入）当中，可以发现症结何在，出路何在。
      （二）劳动管理好坏与按劳取酬原则贯彻如何，对于增加社员收入有极重要的关系。有的社因为合作社窝工或记工、计酬办法不合理，使一些社员减少了收入。为了解决这个问题，我们大力推行了劳动定额、按件计酬与包工包产这三项劳动管理的制度，收到不小的效果。但因社大和干部对高级社的计划管理还缺乏经验，所以至今不少社在劳动管理上，仍程度不同的存在着混乱现象。对于这个复杂而又极端重要的问题，今后必须下大力解决。
      （三）有一些社农业增产，副业减产，相抵之后，增加收入不多。副业，在农民收入中占重要地位。我省农村副业收入占总收入的百分之二十以上，仅次于粮食的收入。有些社农业增长，副业下降，主要原因是我们对于以粮棉增产为中心的多种经营的方针认识不足，贯彻不力。后来，我们采取了全面规划，供销支持，既搞集体副业，也鼓励社员开展利于分散经营的副业等等措施，才出现了农业、副业共同高涨的形势。
    中央规定，合作社在最近几年内必须把总收入的百分之六十至七十分配给社员，留作生产费、公积金、公益金、农业税等的费用，不得超过百分之三十至四十。根据一些社的调查证明，这个政策是符合目前合作社的情况的。只要生产增加，这个界限不仅能保证社员增加收入，而且也能保证合作社生产经营的必需。因此，它深得社员拥护，有力地推动了广大社员为增加生产增加收入而展开的社会主义增产运动。
    应该指出的是，在注意保证多数社员增加收入的同时，对那些没有增加收入的少数人也是不能忽视的。其中包括五保户，因病和因外出而作工少的人，原来的某些小商贩和有的小学教师家属，以及过去土地过多而劳力较少较弱的一些社员。对五保户实行五保办法，对其余的户，目前我们采取的办法是，开展多种经营和帮助他们开展家庭副业，以求增加收入；同时，对生活确实困难者予以补助，对生活不困难者则予以解释，并鼓励他们以后多出工以增加收入。
    第三，合作社的规模以多大为好，是合作社组织建设中的一个重要问题，也是牵涉到劳动管理、生产分配的一个重要问题。
    合作化后第一个生产年度的经验证明，在目前，为了有利生产，便于领导，合作社的规模不宜搞得太大。根据河北省的情况，一般以一村一社为宜；从有利于发展生产出发，如果有条件，有必要，也可以在群众自愿的基础上，把相邻的村庄组成联村社。这是我们在合作化运动发展期间，曾经提出的方针；但是因为有一些同志有越大越好的盲目的热情，省委又缺乏严格的控制，因而建立了不少过大的社。现在全省共有合作社二万四千二百四十九个，其中联村、联乡社占百分之三十三点零二（五百户以上至数千户的社占总社数的百分之二十三），一村一社占百分之六十四点五六，一村数社占百分之二点四二。全省合作社平均每个社的户数是三百四十户，联村、联乡社所包括的户数达社员总户数的百分之六十以上。现在看来，那些出于自愿协作发展生产而组织起来的联村社，而且又是干部强、经验多的社，一般办得还好。有不少数村、十数村包括千户、数千户的大社，出现了以下现象：生产管理困难，政策上难以正确贯彻，社干部不能深入工作，特别是由于村与村之间土地占有和收入悬殊以及生产经营的对象不同，使彼村骤然普遍增加收入，此村社员不能增加收入。经验证明，在目前条件下，数村一社不是发展方向。
    在我省已经建成许多联村、联乡社并办了一年的情况下，我们决定，对这些联村、联乡社，采取“积极帮助整顿”的方针。帮助那些已经办的不错和有条件办好的社办好和办得更好；对那些没有条件办好的社，比如没有互相协作发展生产的条件，村与村之间的经济利益存在着严重矛盾，社员不是自愿而是被勉强合并起来的大社，经过充分商量，采取分别核算的联合社等适当的步骤，逐步改为村社。
    社会主义改造的胜利把旧的矛盾解决了，但新的矛盾也就随着出现了。解决新的矛盾，巩固社会主义改造的胜利，需要我们进行巨大的努力。正如上面所说，合作社面对着社里、社外的主要矛盾有两个：一个是集体和个人的矛盾（包括国家与社、社与社员的关系）；一个是合作社的增产要求和自然、财力、技术、经验等客观条件的矛盾。一年来，我们在指导合作社解决这两个矛盾的过程中，获得了成绩，也发生过错误。我们就在这样不断取得成就与克服缺点、错误的前进过程中取得经验。我愿意重复地说，这些经验中最重要的一条要算是：多和群众（包括下级组织）商量，时刻不忘记走群众路线；警惕主观主义，谨防指导思想的片面性。
    在过去经验的基础上，我们决心以更大的努力，为增加农副业生产，增加社员收入，进一步巩固农业社会主义改造的胜利而斗争。
      在当前，我们正在集中力量努力完成摆在眼前的两项重要任务。就是在遭受严重水灾的地区，依靠合作社开展生产救灾运动，战胜灾荒；在非灾地区，指导合作社做好秋收分配工作。同时，通过生产救灾和秋收分配工作，进一步整顿巩固合作社，帮助它们总结经验，解决劳动管理、副业收入的分配、大社问题、民主办社和制定明年的生产计划等问题，以便为明年的增产运动作好准备。
    我们时刻不忘的是，决心集中力量，在一定的时间内，解决我省海河河系的根本治理问题，以便消除经常压在河北人民头上的水患。把摧毁千百万人民劳动成果的水害，变为水利，这是保证河北省农业年年增产的根本问题。在这样做的过程中，我们迫切希望、也深信会得到中央以及各有关方面的大力支持。
