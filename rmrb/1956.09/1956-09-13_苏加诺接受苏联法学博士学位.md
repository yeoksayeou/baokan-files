    苏加诺接受苏联法学博士学位
    据新华社12日讯　据塔斯社报道：印度尼西亚共和国总统苏加诺11日在莫斯科大学接受了苏联法学博士学位和莫斯科大学名誉教授的荣誉。
    接受的仪式在莫斯科大学的大礼堂中举行。苏联科学院院长?斯米扬诺夫院士和莫斯科大学校长彼得罗夫斯基院士先后宣读了苏联科学院经济、哲学和法学部全体会议关于授予苏加诺法学博士学位的决议，以及莫斯科大学学术委员会关于选举苏加诺为大学的名誉教授的决议，并且把博士学位证书和名誉教授证书赠送给印度尼西亚总统。
    在接受证书以后，苏加诺讲了话，他说，他能够获得法学博士学位和被选为莫斯科大学的名誉教授，“这与其说是他个人的功绩，毋宁说是印度尼西亚人民的功绩”。
    苏加诺说，“的确，没有人民，我就什么都干不成。现在印度尼西亚已经获得的成就是全体印度尼西亚人民劳动的成果”。苏加诺在谈到苏联和印度尼西亚的友谊的时候说，这种友谊不是从计较利害得失产生的。这种友谊是有原则性的友谊，而且将是牢固和永恒的友谊。（附图片）
