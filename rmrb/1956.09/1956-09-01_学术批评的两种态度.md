    Two Attitudes Toward Academic Criticism
    Tian Qing
    The "Literary Heritage" weekly published by Guangming Daily in its 117th issue featured two articles: Guo Moruo's "Reading 'An Explanation of the 'Yi Xi' Chapter of the Zhou Songs'" and Xu Chengyu's "A Critique of the Counter-Criticism of 'Ballads and Ancient Poems'." These two articles reflect two different attitudes and styles in academic research criticism, leaving two different impressions. Guo Moruo humbly discussed the issues with the critics and repeatedly expressed his gratitude for their correction of his mistakes. In contrast, Xu Chengyu said the following in his counter-criticism article: "Before Mr. Liu (referring to Liu She, who wrote an article criticizing Xu's edited 'Ballads and Ancient Poems') had even grasped the so-called 'errors,' he resorted to this kind of 'critical formalism,' intending to deceive readers with lower levels of understanding, and in reality, engaging in a bit of 'self-deception'." "Mr. Liu She's criticism can be described as completely 'missing the point,' and 'distorting the facts,' and is 'incorrect'… Mr. Liu She's several thousand-word critique did not grasp a single error from beginning to end. It was entirely 'pretending to know what he does not know'… and everywhere employing 'bad work style' to hurl abuse…" "Originally, such a critical article 'was not worth my while to painstakingly' refute, 'I finally did so' because it reflects a bad trend in current classical literature research work in terms of criticism: waving the banner of a critic, bandying about hackneyed critical clichés, indiscriminately labeling people, and unleashing a torrent of 'specious,' 'self-righteous,' 'missing the point,' 'distorting the facts' clichés, a chaotic barrage of abuse to deceive readers while 'deceiving oneself'" (Emphasis added by the author). The entire article's tone gives the impression of seething anger.
    Because these two articles were published in the same issue, they naturally constitute a stark contrast. On one hand, there is mutual respect and goodwill between the critic and the criticized, truly exploring academic issues; on the other hand, there is the critic and the criticized, faces red with anger, pointing fingers at each other and hurling insults, fighting over face and dignity!
    Some people often treat criticism with this attitude: If you laugh at me for being a fake scholar, I'll mock you for being an ignorant fool; if you want to accuse me of having a bad work style, I can even more readily accuse you of making a mess!
    I think experts and scholars should set an example. Why are they still so "irascible," unable to establish correct academic attitudes? Wouldn't it be better for both sides to calmly and realistically discuss issues?
    Disdain for others does not necessarily elevate oneself, and abuse cannot solve any academic problems. Please calm down!

    学术批评的两种态度
    田晴
    光明日报的“文学遗产”周刊第117期发表了两篇文章，一是郭沫若先生的“读了‘关于周颂噫嘻篇的解释’”；一是徐澄宇先生的“评‘乐府古诗’的反批评”。这两篇文章反映了学术研究批评上的两种态度、两种风气，给人留下了两种印象。郭沫若先生一方面和批评者虚心地商讨问题，同时一再地表示感谢批评者纠正了他的错误。而徐澄宇先生在反批评的文章中，却说了这样的一些话：“刘君（指曾经写文章批评了徐编‘乐府古诗’的刘射——作者）在未抓到所谓‘错误’之先，先来这一套‘批评八股’，是意图蒙混水平较低的读者，而实际上有点儿‘自欺’。”“像刘射先生这种批评可以说完全是‘隔靴搔痒’和‘歪曲事实’的‘不正确’的。……刘射先生一篇几千字的批评文字，从头到底没有抓住一点错误，完全是‘强不知以为知’，……而处处掉弄‘坏作风’来破口谩骂……”“本来这样一篇批评的文章‘是不值得我花费笔墨去仔细’辩驳的，‘我终于这样做了’，因为它反映了目前古典文学研究工作中在批评方面的一种坏风气：拿着批评家的旗帜，掉弄批评家的八股滥调替人家滥扣帽子，放出一派‘似是而非’、‘自以为是’、‘隔靴搔痒’、‘歪曲事实’的滥调，乱七八糟的谩骂一顿来欺骗读者还以‘自欺’”（重点是作者加的）。整篇文章的语气，给人以怒发冲冠的感觉。
    因为这两篇文章在同一期发表，它就很自然地构成一幅鲜明对比，一方面是批评与被批评者互相尊重与人为善，是真正地在探讨学术问题；另一方面是批评者与被批评者面红耳赤，相互指着对方的鼻子大骂，为了面子和尊严在斗气！
    有些人常以这样的态度对待批评：你笑我是冒牌学者，我就嘲你是无知小子；你要骂我是坏作风，我更可以骂你是拆烂污！
    我想专家学者都应做出表率，为什么还这样“肝火旺盛”，不能树起正确的治学态度？双方都平心静气实事求是商讨问题不好吗？
    对别人的轻蔑未必能抬高自己，而谩骂也不能解决学术上的任何问题。请放冷静些吧！
