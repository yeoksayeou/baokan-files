Xinhua News Agency, September 26th, Paris Dispatch: French Foreign Minister Pineau said at a secret meeting of the French National Assembly's Foreign Affairs Committee on September 25th that France and Britain would ask the United Nations to endorse the international management plan for the Suez Canal adopted by the eighteen countries at the first London conference.
According to reports, after Pineau expressed France's willingness to find a peaceful solution to the Suez issue, he also said, "I cannot say that we will never resort to force, regardless of Nasser's attitude."
Pineau said that France agreed to accept the results of the eighteen-nation London conference with reservations in order to "save Atlantic unity." He also said that if the Suez Canal crisis "deteriorates," countries that take a "weak" stance on this issue "will bear the greatest responsibility." He pointed out that the United States and Italy are among these countries.
Xinhua News Agency, September 26th, Canberra Dispatch: Australian Prime Minister Menzies delivered a speech in the House of Representatives on the evening of September 25th, openly chiming in with the West's policy of threats of force and economic pressure against Egypt.
In his first speech after returning home, Menzies insisted that Egypt's nationalization of the Suez Canal Company was "illegal." He also said that it would be "suicidal" to believe that force could not be used without the approval of the United Nations Security Council.
He argued that if the United Nations "can neither impose economic sanctions nor propose any other effective course of action, then we (canal) users must be prepared to take sanctions on our own without voluntary and formal negotiations." He said, "We should not make such assurances: that we will not use force, regardless of the facts and circumstances."
Menzies asked the House of Representatives to approve Australia's participation in the Suez "Canal Users' Association." However, he also expressed dissatisfaction with the "Canal Users' Association" planned by the eighteen-nation London conference, saying that it was not clear enough.
Menzies' speech was interrupted more than once by angry shouts from opposition members. When he talked about imposing economic sanctions on Egypt, Labor members shouted: "The Australian people will not accept such provocative actions," "Economic sanctions mean war."
Opposition Labor leader Evatt pointed out in his speech that the establishment of the "Users' Association" was provocative. Evatt called on Australia to support India's plan to establish an advisory body and have Egypt manage the canal. He advocated resolving the Suez Canal issue through negotiations.

    比诺向议会表示不打算放弃武力政策
    孟席斯为西方的武力威胁政策帮腔
    新华社26日讯　巴黎消息：法国外交部长比诺9月25日在法国国民议会外交委员会的秘密会议上说，法英将要求联合国赞同在第一次伦敦会议上十八国采纳的国际管理苏伊士运河的计划。
    据透露，比诺在表示法国愿意寻找和平解决苏伊士问题的办法以后又说，“我不能说，不管纳赛尔持什么态度，我们将永远不求助于武力。”
    比诺说，法国有保留地同意接受十八国伦敦会议的结果，是为了“挽救大西洋的团结”。他还说，如果苏伊士运河危机“恶化”的话，在这个问题上采取“软弱”立场的国家“要负最大的责任”。他指出，在这种国家中有美国和意大利。
    据新华社26日讯　堪培拉消息：澳大利亚总理孟席斯9月25日晚上在众议院发表演说，公开为西方对埃及的武力威胁和经济压力政策帮腔。
    孟席斯在他回国后的第一次演说中硬说埃及把苏伊士运河公司收归国有的行动是“非法”的。他并且说，如果认为不得到联合国安全理事会的赞同就不能使用武力，那将是“自杀”。
    他主张，如果联合国“既不能实行经济制裁又不能提出其他任何有效的行动方针的话，我们这些（运河）使用国就必须在没有自愿和正式的谈判的情况下准备自行采取制裁办法”。他说：“我们不应当作这样的保证：不管事实和情况怎样，我们都不使用武力。”
    孟席斯要求众议院批准澳大利亚参加苏伊士“运河使用国协会”。但是他又对伦敦十八国会议所计划成立的“运河使用国协会”表示不满，说它不够明确。
    孟席斯的演说不止一次地被反对党议员愤怒的呼声所打断。当他谈到对埃及施行经济制裁的时候，工党议员们高喊：“澳大利亚人民不会接受这样的挑衅行动”，“经济制裁意味着战争”。
    反对党工党领袖伊瓦特在发言中指出成立“使用国协会”是挑衅性的。伊瓦特要求澳大利亚支持印度关于成立咨询机构并且由埃及管理运河的计划。他主张通过谈判来解决苏伊士运河问题。
