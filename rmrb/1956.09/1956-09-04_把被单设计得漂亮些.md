    Make the Bed Sheets More Beautiful
    In recent years, many printed bed sheets have appeared on the market. Most of these bed sheets have a pattern of one cluster of flowers in the center and four clusters of flowers in the four corners, which seems to have become a unified standard, with no more patterns to vary. No wonder consumers call this kind of bed sheet "four dishes and one soup," or "four corners and a square." Some flower bed sheets produced in some areas also have uncoordinated color schemes. The colored flower bed sheets produced by some handicraft cooperatives in Hunan and other places also have the problem of fading.
    As the living standards of the broad masses of people improve, they demand that daily necessities be manufactured more beautifully and that patterns be changed. There are many things to learn from our country's cultural relics treasury and folk art works. It would not be impossible to imitate the borders on the caissons of the Dunhuang caves and print more bed sheets with four-sided borders or two-sided borders and a blank space in the middle.　　　　　　　　Liu Shiyi

    把被单设计得漂亮些
    近几年，市场上出现很多印花被单，这些被单的花样大多是中间一团花，四角四团花，好像已经成了统一的规格，再也没有什么花样可变了。难怪消费者都把这种床单叫成“四菜一汤”，或者“四角一方”。有些地区生产的花被单，配色也很不协调。湖南等地有的手工业合作社生产的彩色花被单还有落色的毛病。
    广大人民在生活水平提高以后，都要求把日用品制造得更美观一些，换一换花样。我国的文物宝库和民间的艺术作品中，有很多可以学习的地方。如能仿照敦煌藻井上的花边，多印些四边花边或两边花边、中间空白的床单，也未尝不可。　　　　　　　　刘世一
