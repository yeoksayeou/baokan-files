    Election Work Must Not Be Done Hastily
    Editor: There are still many shortcomings in the pilot work of the grassroots elections in Shenyang this time. The most prominent is that the election authorities were hasty and irresponsible in introducing the qualifications and work performance of the representative candidates to the voters. For example, in the first electoral district of Shenhe District, Shenyang City, a total of eight representative candidates were nominated. The election authority simply printed the resumes of these eight representative candidates (the printing was blurry and there were typos) and handed them over to the voter groups for discussion. This resume form only had items such as "Name, Gender, Age, Work Experience" and "Strengths and Weaknesses," even omitting "Hometown, Ethnicity, and Party Affiliation." In particular, the "Strengths and Weaknesses" column only had empty phrases such as "works actively, has a correct work style, and can connect with the masses." Even as a general cadre appraisal form, it is not up to standard. After receiving such a "resume," it is really difficult for voters to express any opinions.
    The representative candidates are proposed after careful consultation between the Party organization, various democratic parties, and people's organizations, and we basically trust them. However, voters also have the right to know more about the representative candidates. At a discussion I attended, someone asked: "Since the head of the district's health department is a representative candidate, why not simply write down one or two outstanding examples of his leadership in health work?" However, a comrade sent by the election authority replied at the meeting: "Even if it's written down, you'll only see things on paper and still not know him personally; anyway, everyone can trust him, the candidates can't be wrong." Although the comrade "cleared up our thinking," the discussion still couldn't get started. Helpless, the comrade then said: "If everyone really can't offer any opinions on the candidates, then you can raise your hopes and demands for them after they are elected!" This is absurd! The main purpose of voters discussing candidates is to review whether they are qualified. How can we talk about "hopes and demands" before they are elected! When some voters asked about the allocation of representative quotas, the comrade said: "I don't know either!" This is also absurd! If voters don't know the proportion of representative quota allocation, how can they comment on whether the allocation of representative candidates from various social strata is reasonable?
    The following situation has also occurred in Shenyang: it was originally stipulated that people should participate in elections where their household registration is. However, this time, some voters received two voter certificates; and in some cases, the voters' ages were written incorrectly on the voter certificates. These all show carelessness and sloppiness in the work. This style should not appear in election work.　Liu Jianyin

### 选举工作不能草率从事

    选举工作不能草率从事
    编辑同志：沈阳市这次的基层选举试点工作还存在着许多缺点。最显著的是选举机关在向选民介绍代表候选人的资历和工作表现的时候，草率从事，不够负责。如沈阳市沈河区的第一选区共提出了八名代表候选人，选举机关只是将这八名代表候选人的简历打印了一下（印得模糊不清，还有错字）就交到各选民小组去讨论。这张简历表里只有“姓名、性别、年龄、工作简历”和“优、缺点”几个项目，连“籍贯、民族、党派”都省略了。特别是“优、缺点”这一栏，又只有“工作积极、作风正派、能联系群众”等空空洞洞的寥寥数语。就是作为一般的干部鉴定表，也是不合乎要求的。选民接到这样的“鉴定表”以后，实在很难发表什么意见。
    代表候选人是党的组织和各民主党派、人民团体慎重协商之后提出的，我们基本上是信任的。但是选民也有权利要求对代表候选人知道得多一些。在我参加的一次讨论会上就有人提出：“既然区里的卫生科长是代表候选人，却为什么不把他在领导卫生工作中突出的一、二事例简单地写下来呢？”但选举机关派来的一位同志却在会上答复说：“写上了，你们也不过是看到纸上的东西，同样不认识他本人；反正大家相信好了，候选人都错不了。”虽然经过这位同志的“打通思想”，但讨论会仍然是开不起来。没办法，这位同志接着又说：“如果大家对候选人实在提不出什么意见，那么你们就提提对他们当选后的希望和要求吧！”这真是奇谈！选民讨论候选人，主要是审查他们是否合格，在他们还没有当选的时候，怎么能提到“希望和要求”呢！当有的选民问到代表名额分配的问题时，这位同志却说：“我也不知道哩！”这又奇了！如果选民不知道代表名额分配的比例，又怎么能对各阶层的代表候选人的分配是否合理提出意见呢？
    沈阳还出现了这样的情况：本来规定户口在哪里便参加哪里的选举。但是，这次却有的选民得到了两个选民证；也有的是在选民证上把选民的年龄写错了。这些，都说明了工作上的草率和粗枝大叶。这种作风，是不应该在选举工作中出现的。　刘剑吟
