Xinhua News Agency, 6th: At Beijing Railway Station, trains loaded with materials to support disaster areas depart day and night. According to statistics from the Beijing Railway Administration, since the beginning of August, over 90,000 tons of materials, including grain, seeds, medicines, timber, and construction materials, have been transported to disaster areas such as Hebei and Anhui.

Recently, the railway department has designated materials supporting disaster areas as the most important transportation project, stipulating that it is not subject to transportation plan restrictions and must be shipped out at any time or within a specified time limit.

The Beijing Grain Bureau has just shipped 15 million jin of rice, corn, and other grains to support Hebei Province and is now busy preparing to transfer a second batch of approximately 10 million jin of grain. The Second Commercial Bureau's specialized companies dealing in electrical appliances, hardware, timber, and trade have, despite tight supplies, allocated more than 20,000 sacks and a large quantity of galvanized wire, timber, and inner tubes for car tires to supply the disaster areas. At the end of August, the Beijing Pharmaceutical Company transferred more than 50 boxes of over eighty kinds of medicines for treating diarrhea, dysentery, heatstroke, and rheumatic arthritis, as well as a large number of medical devices and tonics, to support the disaster areas in Hebei Province.

    北京调运物资支援灾区人民
    新华社6日讯　在北京车站，日夜都有满载着支援灾区的物资的列车驶出。据北京铁路管理局统计，从8月初到现在，运往河北、安徽等灾区的粮食、种籽、医药品、木料、建筑器材等物资约在九万吨以上。
    铁路部门在最近时期以来，把支援灾区的物资列为最重要的运输项目，规定不受运输计划的限制，随时或限期运出。
    北京市粮食局刚把支援河北省的一千五百万斤大米、玉米等粮食运出，目前又在紧张地准备调运第二批约一千万斤粮食。第二商业局所属交电、五金、木材、贸易等专业公司在货源较紧张的情况下，调出了二万多条麻袋和大批铅丝、木材和汽车轮胎内带等物资，供应灾区。北京市医药公司8月底调运出五十多箱治疗水泻、痢疾、中暑和风湿性关节炎等病的药品八十多种以及大批医疗器械和补养品，支援河北省灾区。
