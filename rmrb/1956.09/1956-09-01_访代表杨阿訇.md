Visiting Representative Yang Ahong
On the morning of the 28th, in a quiet reception room in the Niujie Mosque, voters were visiting Yang Deliang, a candidate for the People's Representative of Xuanwu District. He was a representative in the previous term and has been nominated by the masses again this time. Yu Lanting, the leader of the voter visiting group, told me that they would conduct serious interviews with each candidate to understand their situation, especially for the representatives of the previous term, to find out how much they had done for the people, which the voters would use as the basis for their votes.

Yang Deliang is the Ahong of the Niujie Mosque. This mosque is the oldest of the eighty mosques in Beijing, with a history of over nine hundred years. Niujie is also a residential area for the Hui people. Therefore, Ahong Yang is well known among the masses. Since he is also a former representative, the voters are still very concerned about what he did during his term.

After listening to the opinions of the visiting voters, Ahong Yang first mentioned the establishment of a bus stop for Route 10 at the mosque, which everyone knew about. Originally, there were bus stops at the north and south entrances of Niujie. Niujie is very long, and there was no stop in the middle, which was very inconvenient for the residents. Therefore, based on the needs of the masses, he wrote a letter to the Municipal Public Transport Company. After the company sent someone to investigate, they agreed with his opinion. Since then, a new stop for Route 10 bus has been added in front of the mosque.

Another thing is also commendable. Many of the Hui people in Niujie sell fried cakes and qiegao (a kind of rice cake). These snacks need to be made with yellow rice, but after the implementation of the unified purchase and sale of grain, the relevant departments did not consider this need enough, so that at one time, it was impossible to buy yellow rice in the market, which affected their lives. Ahong Yang promptly reported this situation to the government, and the supply in this area was quickly improved.

Although these are small things, they show the role that a people's representative who cares about the lives of the masses can play between the masses and the government.

    访代表杨阿訇
    28日早晨，在牛街清真寺里的一间幽静的会客室里，选民们正在访问宣武区人民代表候选人杨德亮。他是上届代表，这次又被群众提名为候选人。选民访问组的组长于兰亭告诉我：他们对每一个候选人都要进行认真的访问，了解他们的情况，特别是对于上届代表，究竟给人民做了多少事情，选民们都要作为自己投票的根据。
    杨德亮是牛街清真寺的阿訇。这座清真寺是北京市八十座清真寺中最古老的一座，已经有九百多年的历史。牛街又是回民聚居的地区，因此，杨阿訇在群众中，大家比较熟悉，他又是一个老代表，就是这样，选民们对于他在任期间所做的事，还是十分关心。
    杨阿訇听完了来访选民的意见以后，首先举出大家所知道的十路公共汽车在礼拜寺设站的事。原来在牛街的北口和南口都有停车站，牛街很长，中途没站，居民很不方便。因此，他根据群众的需要，给市公共汽车公司写了一封信。公司派人作过调查以后，同意了他的意见。从此，十路公共汽车就在礼拜寺的门前增设了一站。
    还有一件事，也是为人称道的。牛街的回民中有很多人卖炸糕和切糕的，这种小吃需要用黄米做，但在实行粮食统购统销以后，主管部门对这方面的需要考虑得不够，以致有一个时候，在市上买不到黄米，影响了他们的生活。杨阿訇及时向政府反映了这个情况，很快就改进了这方面的供应。
    这些虽然是小事，但可以从中看出一个关心群众生活的人民代表，在群众和政府之间所起的作用。
