Xinhua News Agency, London, September 12th: The British and French government leaders concluded their talks in London on September 11, discussing further measures to deal with Egypt. The communiqué issued after the meeting stated that the British and French governments "agreed that President Nasser's (of Egypt) refusal to negotiate on the basis of this (international control of the Suez Canal) plan has created a very serious situation."

The communiqué said that the meeting "discussed further measures to be taken and reached complete agreement on these measures." The communiqué emphasized that Britain and France were "determined to use all appropriate means" to deal with Egypt's "arbitrary interference with rights established by international agreements." According to the Associated Press, British foreign officials, in explaining the meaning of this sentence to reporters, stated that this certainly does not exclude the possibility of using force.

French Prime Minister Mollet said at a press conference held after the meeting that the details agreed upon at the Anglo-French talks would be announced by Eden when the British House of Commons begins debating the Suez issue on September 12, and France will then issue a statement in Paris.

    英法首脑会谈后发表公报
    继续对埃及进行威吓和挑衅
    据新华社12日讯　伦敦消息：英法两国政府首脑9月11日在伦敦结束了讨论对付埃及的下一步措施的双方会谈。会谈后发表的公报说，英法政府“一致认为（埃及）纳赛尔总统拒绝在这个（国际管制苏彝士运河）计划的基础上进行谈判已经造成了非常严重的局势”。
    公报说，会谈“讨论了要采取的进一步措施，并且就这些措施取得了完全一致的意见”。公报强调说，英法两国“决心以一切适当的手段”来对付埃及“对国际协定所确立的权利的专横干涉”。据美联社报道，英国外交官员在对记者解释这句话的含意时表示，这当然不排斥使用武力的可能性。
    法国总理摩勒在会谈结束后举行的记者招待会上说，英法会谈商定的细节将由艾登在9月12日在英国下院开始辩论苏彝士问题时宣布，法国接着将在巴黎发表声明。
