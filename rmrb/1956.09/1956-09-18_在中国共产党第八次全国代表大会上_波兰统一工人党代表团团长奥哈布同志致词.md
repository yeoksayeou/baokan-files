Comrades and friends! Brothers and sisters!
The Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, on behalf of the 1.4 million members of the Party, extends warm fraternal congratulations to the heroic Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China. We wish your Congress complete success, and we wish you further achievements in your labor for the happiness of the Chinese people, for the victory of our great socialist cause, and for the consolidation of peace and the development of friendly cooperation between countries with different social systems.

It is thousands of kilometers from Warsaw to Beijing, but it only takes a few words to explain how close the Polish and Chinese people are today.

What unites us is the common struggle for peace and human progress, the friendly alliance with the great Soviet state, the common desire of the people on the banks of the Vistula and the Yellow River to establish a socialist system, the common ideology, and the immortal great ideology of Marxism-Leninism.

The Polish revolutionary workers' movement has its own long and glorious history. For nearly sixty years, Polish revolutionaries have waged a struggle, in extreme secrecy, against the violence of the Tsars and Kaisers, and against the terror of the Polish and German fascists. Therefore, Polish revolutionaries, based on their own experience, can appreciate and cherish the heroism of the Chinese Communists. The Chinese Communist Party's many years of resolute revolutionary struggle against the brutal rule of the imperialists and the traitorous and wicked Kuomintang government, for the liberation of the Chinese people and the establishment of a government of workers and peasants, has won the praise of people of all countries.

Your historic victory over imperialism and reactionary forces has also aroused universal joy in Poland. Every new achievement in your arduous socialist construction is also wholeheartedly cheered by the Polish workers and peasants who have brotherly friendship with the great Chinese people.

Under the leadership of the Polish United Workers' Party, the Polish people have made great achievements in the cause of building the foundations of socialism.

We have rebuilt our country from the ruins of war. We have established industry, and industrial output per capita has increased fivefold compared to 1938. We have established new industrial sectors such as automobiles, tractors, airplanes, shipbuilding, and mining machinery. We have established new large-scale metallurgical plants for steel and non-ferrous metals. This year, our country will produce approximately 5 million tons of steel and 96 million tons of coal.

Our new five-year plan stipulates that industrial output will increase by more than 50 percent, agricultural products will increase by more than 25 percent, and workers' wages and farmers' incomes will increase by 30 percent.

This is an extremely complex and arduous task. Completing this task requires the working people of our country to make great efforts and work hard. It requires our party, which leads socialist construction, to put in a great deal of labor and wisdom.

The basic condition for completing the glorious tasks of our five-year plan is to maintain and consolidate international peace.

Poland, like China and the countries of the socialist camp, is particularly concerned with defending peace.

It is enough to remember one fact: during the Second World War, fascist bandits slaughtered approximately 700,000 unarmed residents in Warsaw, our capital city, alone. This is more than the total number of people who died in the United States in the First and Second World Wars and in all the wars the United States has engaged in in the two hundred years since its founding.

The Polish people clearly remember all the terrible scenes of imperialist wars, and therefore are willing to make every effort to defend peace and consistently support the peace policy of the Soviet Union, People's China, and our entire socialist camp. The socialist camp is struggling to break the colonialists' plans to provoke new bloody wars for the benefit of American and British monopoly capitalists and billionaires.

For the benefit of the masses of the people, for our peaceful socialist construction, we, like you, need peace.

If we can strengthen economic cooperation with the fraternal countries of the socialist camp, if we make wider use of the experience of the Soviet Union and the people's democracies, we can complete the great and arduous tasks of the new five-year plan faster and better.

The Polish United Workers' Party is closely watching the creative activities of the Communist Party of China and the various courageous decisions made by your Central Committee based on Marxist-Leninist principles and taking into account the specific and unique conditions of your great country.

Your Congress will summarize the great achievements made in the past period and set out the tasks for socialist construction in the future. We believe that the activists of the Polish United Workers' Party will study the various decisions of your Congress.

The Polish delegation requests all delegates of the Congress to convey to all workers and peasants in the Yellow River, Pearl River, and Yangtze River basins and in the coastal provinces of China, to the workers and peasants in Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, Guangzhou, and the revolutionary traditional areas of Jiangxi, Hunan, Shaanxi, and Sichuan, to the workers and peasants in the industrially developed Northeast and the remote pastoral areas of Tibet, the warm, fraternal congratulations from the workers and peasants on both banks of the Polish Vistula River and Oder River, the Carpathian Mountains and the Baltic Sea, the metallurgical workers of Warsaw, the textile workers of Łódź, the miners and metallurgical workers of Silesia, the shipbuilders and sailors of Gdańsk, the university students of Kraków, the Polish soldiers, and all the Polish people.

We sincerely wish you to unify all your national territory, quickly liberate Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, and wish you new achievements in developing industry and agriculture, prospering science and culture, and further improving the living standards of the working people.

Your achievements are also our achievements. Your joy is also our joy.

May the friendship between the People's Poland and the great liberated China be continuously consolidated!

Long live the victory of socialism in China, Poland, and the world!

    在中国共产党第八次全国代表大会上
    波兰统一工人党代表团团长奥哈布同志致词亲爱的同志们和朋友们！兄弟姊妹们！
    波兰统一工人党中央委员会代表波兰一百四十万党员向英勇的中国共产党的第八次代表大会致以热烈的兄弟般的祝贺，祝你们的大会圆满成功，祝你们为中国人民的幸福，为我们伟大社会主义事业的胜利，为巩固和平和发展社会制度不同的各个国家间友好合作关系而从事的劳动，获得进一步的成就。
    从华沙到北京，要飞行几千公里，但是用不了几句话就能说明今天波兰人民和中国人民是如何的亲密。
    把我们团结在一起的是争取和平和人类进步的共同斗争，是同伟大苏维埃国家的友好同盟，是维斯杜拉河畔和黄河河畔的人们建立社会主义制度的共同愿望，是共同的思想，是不朽的伟大马克思列宁主义思想。
    波兰的革命工人运动有着自己长久的和光荣的历史。在将近六十年的时间内，波兰革命者曾经在极端秘密的状态下进行了反对沙皇和凯撒的暴力、反对波兰和德国法西斯分子恐怖的斗争。因此，波兰革命者根据自己的经验可以体会到并珍视中国共产党人的英勇精神。中国共产党人为反抗帝国主义者的残暴统治和罪恶的国民党卖国政府，争取中国人民的解放和建立工农政权而进行的多年的坚决的革命斗争，赢得了各国人民的赞扬。
    你们对帝国主义和反动势力的具有历史意义的胜利，也在波兰引起了普遍的欢欣。你们在艰巨的社会主义建设事业中的每一个新的成就，也受到对伟大中国人民有着兄弟般友谊的波兰工人和农民的衷心的欢呼。
    波兰人民在波兰统一工人党的领导下，在建设社会主义基础的事业中取得了巨大的成就。
    我们从战后的废墟中重建了我们的国家。我们建立了工业，工业产量按人口平均计算较一九三八年已经增长了五倍。我们建立了汽车、拖拉机、飞机、造船和采矿机器等新的工业部门。我们建立了新的规模巨大的钢铁和有色金属的冶金工厂。今年我国将产钢约五百万吨，煤九千六百万吨。
    我们新的五年计划规定：工业产量增加百分之五十以上，农产品增加百分之二十五以上，工人的工资和农民的收入增长百分之三十。
    这是一个极其复杂而艰巨的任务。完成这个任务要求我国劳动人民作极大的努力，艰苦奋斗。要求我们领导社会主义建设的党付出大量劳动和智慧。
    完成我国五年计划的光荣任务的基本条件是维护和巩固国际和平。
    波兰像中国和社会主义阵营各国一样，特别关心保卫和平。
    只要记起下面一个事实就够了。第二次世界大战期间，法西斯强盗仅仅在我国首都华沙一个城市里就屠杀了七十万左右手无保护的居民。这比美国在第一、第二次世界大战中以及美国建国两百年来所进行的各次战争中死去的人数的总和还要多。
    波兰人民很清楚地记得帝国主义战争的一切可怕的情景，因此愿意尽一切努力来保卫和平，并始终不渝地支持苏联、人民中国和我们整个社会主义阵营的和平政策。社会主义阵营正在为取得打破殖民主义强盗们为了美英垄断资本家和亿万富翁们的利益，企图挑起新的流血战争的计划而斗争。
    为了人民群众的利益，为了我们和平的社会主义建设，我们和你们一样，需要和平。
    如果我们能够加强同社会主义阵营各个兄弟国家的经济合作，如果我们更广泛地利用苏联和各人民民主国家的经验，我们就能更快地和更好地完成新的五年计划的伟大而艰巨的任务。
    波兰统一工人党密切注意着中国共产党的创造性的活动和你们中央委员会根据马克思列宁主义原则估计到你们伟大的国家的具体的特殊条件而采取的各项勇敢的决定。
    你们的代表大会将要总结过去一个时期所取得的巨大成就，并规定今后社会主义建设的任务，我们相信，波兰统一工人党的积极分子将研究你们的代表大会的各项决定。
    波兰代表团请大会的全体代表向中国黄河、珠江和长江流域以及沿海各省的全体工人和农民，向北京、上海、南京、广州以及富有革命传统的江西、湖南、陕西、四川的工人和农民，向工业发达的东北和边远的畜牧区西藏的工人和农民，转达波兰维斯杜拉河和奥德河两岸、喀尔巴阡山和波罗的海的工人和农民、华沙的冶金工人、罗兹的纺织工人、西里西亚的矿工和冶金工人、革但斯坦的造船工人和海员、克拉科夫的大学生、波兰士兵和全体波兰人民的热烈的兄弟般的祝贺。
    我们衷心地祝你们统一全国的领土，迅速解放台湾和澎湖列岛，祝你们在发展工业和农业、繁荣科学和文化、进一步提高劳动人民的生活水平方面取得新的成就。
    你们的成就也就是我们的成就。你们的欢乐也就是我们的欢乐。
    愿人民波兰和伟大的解放了的中国之间的友谊不断巩固！
    社会主义在中国、波兰和全世界胜利万岁！
