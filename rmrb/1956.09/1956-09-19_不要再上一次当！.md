    Don't Be Fooled Again!
    These people should remember that when they went to the first London conference, many of them also declared that they would safeguard Egypt's sovereignty and advocate a peaceful solution to the problem. But as a result, they were fooled by the United States and supported the "Dulles Plan," and the consequence was that the threat of war in the Middle East was not eased, but greatly intensified.
    Now, in order to reduce these countries' hesitation about participating in the second London conference, the United States is again making a lot of noise, saying that its "Users' Association" plan can be "drastically modified." The "Dulles Plan" also gained the support of seventeen countries after so-called "modifications." The United States, Britain, and France used this plan to provoke Egypt. Now, what kind of "modifications" is the United States preparing to make to the "Users' Association" plan? The U.S. State Department has bluntly stated that "the United States will implement the plan to establish a Suez Canal Users' Association with Britain and France, regardless of President Nasser's opposition." It can be seen that the United States' "modifications" are at most playing with words, just as the "Dulles Plan" was so-called "modified," to deceive other countries into supporting it. The "Users' Association," no matter how it changes, is still a shameless colonialist conspiracy to provoke the Egyptian people.
    At the same time, for Britain and France, the intentions of the United States today are very clear. Britain has already spent far more than 100 million pounds simply to threaten Egypt with force. The United States is clearly watching Britain's growing difficulties with schadenfreude. Before leaving for London, Dulles flatly denied the economic assistance to Britain and France that the United States had been promoting. He indicated that the United States was only concerned with taking advantage of Britain and France's difficulties to expand U.S. oil exports to them. This essentially shows that the United States is preparing to take this opportunity to defeat Britain forever in the struggle for oil resources and markets. Britain and France, due to the use of force against Egypt with the support and encouragement of the United States, have already put themselves in a difficult position. If they think it wise to accept the "Users' Association" plan devised by Dulles, then they are deliberately walking into a trap set by the United States with their eyes closed.
    The countries participating in the second London conference are now in danger of being dragged into the water by the United States. If they agree to participate in the adventurous "Users' Association" plan, the result will be unfavorable to all countries except the United States. They must be vigilant: the United States, Britain, and France are using this "Users' Association" to carry out armed intervention in Egypt. This is a real and present danger. Moreover, even if the United States vigorously promotes not using force, once the U.S. election is over, the United States may blatantly use direct military intervention to implement its policy towards Egypt, and the "Users' Association" is a tool that the United States can use at any time to show its hand. At that time, all countries that support this plan will not be able to escape responsibility, nor will they be able to escape the clutches of the United States.
    The participating countries in the second London conference must know that supporting the "Users' Association" plan means joining the ranks of colonialism, and some of these countries themselves are deeply harmed by colonialism. These countries should seriously consider from their own interests whether they can afford the consequences of offending and alienating the Egyptian people and the more than one billion people in Asia and Africa.

### 不要再上一次当！

    不要再上一次当！
    这些人应当记得，当他们去参加第一次伦敦会议的时候，他们之中不少人也曾经宣布过要维护埃及的主权、主张和平解决问题。但是结果，他们上了美国的当，支持了“杜勒斯计划”，而所得到的后果是中东的战争威胁不是和缓了，而是大大严重了起来。
    现在，美国为了减少这些国家对于参加第二次伦敦会议的犹豫，又在大放空气，说什么它的“使用国协会”计划可以“剧烈修改”。“杜勒斯计划”也是在经过所谓“修改”以后得到十七国的支持的。美、英、法就拿了这个计划对埃及进行挑衅。现在，美国又准备对“使用国协会”的计划作什么样的“修改”呢？美国国务院已经露骨表明，“美国将不顾纳赛尔总统的反对，而同英国和法国一起实行建立苏彝士运河使用国协会的计划”。可见，美国的“修改”顶多只是玩弄一些字眼，像“杜勒斯计划”曾经作了所谓“修改”的那样，来骗取其他国家的支持，而“使用国协会”，万变不离其宗，仍然是一个对埃及人民进行无耻挑衅的殖民主义阴谋。
    同时，对于英、法两国来说，今天美国的意图已经很明显了。仅仅为了对埃及进行武力威胁，英国已经耗费了远远超过一亿英镑的巨款。美国显然以幸灾乐祸的心情看着英国与日俱增的困难。杜勒斯在动身到伦敦去以前，一口否认了美国方面曾经宣传过的要给予英、法以经济上的帮助。他表明美国所关心的，只是利用英、法的困难，扩大美国对它们的石油输出。这实质上表明了美国准备趁此机会，在争夺石油资源和市场的斗争中永远打败英国。英、法由于在美国支持和怂恿下对埃及使用武力威胁，已经使自己处于骑虎难下的窘境。如果它们以接受杜勒斯想出来的“使用国协会”计划为得计，那它们就是在故意闭着眼睛走进美国布下的陷阱。
    参加第二次伦敦会议的国家，现在完全有被美国拖下水去的危险。如果它们同意参加“使用国协会”的冒险计划，那么，其结果除了对美国有利以外，对于所有其他国家都是不利的。它们必须警惕：美、英、法三国利用这个“使用国协会”来实行武力干涉埃及。这是一个现实存在的危险。而且，即使美国极力宣传不使用武力，但是一到美国大选结束，美国完全有可能露骨地用直接的军事干涉来执行它对埃及的政策，而“使用国协会”就是美国随时可以利用来摊牌的一个工具。到那时候，凡是支持这个计划的国家都将脱不了责任，也逃不了美国的罗网。
    第二次伦敦会议的参与国必须知道：支持“使用国协会”的计划，就意味着参加殖民主义的行列，而它们之中有些国家本身就是深受殖民主义的危害的。这些国家应当从它们本身的利益出发认真考虑一下，它们是不是吃得消得罪和疏远埃及人民和亚非地区的十多亿人民所带来的后果。
