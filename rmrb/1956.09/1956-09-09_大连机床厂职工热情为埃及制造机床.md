Xinhua News Agency, Lüda, 7th—Workers at the Dalian Machine Tool Plant recently manufactured a new semi-automatic "1730" machine tool for the Republic of Egypt. This machine tool can be fitted with five cutters simultaneously, resulting in high cutting efficiency.

Since the Republic of Egypt nationalized the Suez Canal, the workers of this plant have been very concerned about the progress of this event. Many workers have held seminars and meetings to discuss this issue. Just as this was happening, they received the task of manufacturing a machine tool for Egypt. The workers actively supported the struggle of the Egyptian people with practical actions. When manufacturing this machine tool, Wang Guihe, a worker in the assembly workshop, polished the surface accuracy of the bed lower than the allowable error specified in the operating procedures. Inspector Yu Tianyu carefully inspected every part, even checking whether the screw heads were flat. He usually spent two hours inspecting a machine tool, but he spent three and a half hours inspecting this one.

    大连机床厂职工热情为埃及制造机床
    新华社旅大7日电　大连机床厂的职工最近为埃及共和国制造了一台新式的半自动“一七三○”机床。这台机床同时能装五把刀，切削效率很高。
    自从埃及共和国把苏彝士运河收归国有以后，这个厂的职工们都很关心这一事件的进展，不少工人举行座谈和开会讨论这个问题。正在这个时候，他们接到了给埃及制造一台机床的任务，工人们就积极地从实际行动来支援埃及人民的斗争。在制造这台机床时，装配车间的工人王桂和把床面精度的误差研磨得比操作规程中规定的允许误差还低。检查员于天玉对每个零件都仔细检查过，甚至螺丝头平不平都做了检查。平时他检查一台机床只用两小时，检查这一台机床时，他用了三个半小时。
