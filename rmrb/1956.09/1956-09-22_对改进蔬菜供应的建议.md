Suggestions for Improving Vegetable Supply

Editor's Note: Since this newspaper has continuously published opinions on the vegetable supply problem in Beijing, we have received many letters from readers putting forward specific suggestions for improving vegetable supply in the future. We hope that relevant departments will pay attention to studying these opinions and improve the vegetable supply work.

Combining State Management and Free Trade

After reading Comrade Song Guangwei's article "How to Improve Vegetable Supply Work" in the People's Daily on July 30th and several articles on the vegetable supply work in Beijing in the People's Daily on September 1st, I have the following opinions.

Beijing began implementing the policy of purchasing and marketing all vegetables from suburban vegetable cooperatives this year. The basic reasons for doing so are: it can guarantee the income of vegetable farmers, which is beneficial to producers; it can unify the control of supply and stabilize market prices, which is beneficial to consumers. Judging from the current situation, these reasons are divorced from reality.

First of all, unified purchase and marketing have not guaranteed the reasonable income of vegetable farmers. According to the directors of Puhuangyu and Dongfanghong Production Cooperatives, the wholesale station's "holding up the baskets" for too long during the peak season caused the production cooperatives to rot 1.2 million jin of tomatoes, kohlrabi, and other vegetables.

In order to guarantee the income of vegetable farmers, the Beijing Vegetable Company has also lost a lot of money in the price difference between purchasing and wholesale. I believe that in the future, only by adopting the method of the state operating a portion of the vegetables and allowing vegetable farmers to directly sell the rest to retail units and consumers can it be beneficial to producers. During the peak season, if there is a surplus of vegetables or the price is too low, affecting the income of vegetable farmers, state-owned commercial enterprises can take measures such as purchasing, processing, transferring out of the city, or subsidizing to guarantee the income of vegetable farmers.

Secondly, the reason that unified purchase and marketing can unify the control of supply and stabilize the market is also untenable. Because stabilizing the market depends on: a sufficient vegetable production base; business methods that are conducive to the circulation of vegetable commodities; and the rational distribution of the commercial network to give play to the enthusiasm of all members in the retail sector. If the above problems are solved, and at the same time, a form of combining state-owned operation and direct buying and selling of production and sales is adopted, the stability of the market can be guaranteed. It should be recognized that the so-called market stability refers to the main bulk vegetables being stable at a certain reasonable price level, and it is by no means that the prices of all vegetables are fixed.

Some people may ask: Will market fluctuations occur in the off-season if this is done? This concern is also unnecessary. Because, firstly, suburban vegetable farmers have all formed advanced production cooperatives, and retail vendors have also formed joint purchase and sales or joint purchase and distribution groups. Secondly, in the off-season, state-owned companies can appropriately expand the operating proportion of major vegetables, plus the supply of goods from other places (southern vegetables transported to the north) controlled by state-owned commercial enterprises, as well as bean processed products, etc., can also guarantee the reasonable stability of the market.

I hope that the relevant departments in Beijing will quickly study the opinions of the masses and take effective measures to improve the work. Sun Jian

Restore Free Market Under State Leadership

I propose a solution to the vegetable supply problem for everyone to study.

My specific suggestion is: reorganize the Vegetable Company into a Vegetable Management Office. It is only responsible for managing the vegetable market in the city, reasonably stipulating vegetable market prices, and grasping the negotiated prices when necessary. It will no longer order or purchase from suburban vegetable cooperatives. The vegetables produced by the suburban vegetable cooperatives can be freely sold to various vegetable markets in the city (but it is strictly forbidden to sell them outside the market), forming several wholesale markets under the leadership of the Vegetable Management Office. Retail stores selling vegetables (including state-owned and joint state-private) send people to the vegetable market every day to buy vegetables. Small stores can send one person from several stores to the vegetable market, eliminating the current method of unified allocation through the company. Vegetable vendors can purchase at designated vegetable markets with a permit. The sales area of ​​peddlers is not restricted, and they can be appropriately organized into joint purchase and distribution cooperative groups, each responsible for its own profits and losses.

After the Vegetable Company is changed to a Management Office, it can make more use of the law of market value. When there are too many vegetables on the market, they can be purchased in large quantities and transported to other places for sale, or easily stored vegetables can be stored in the city; when there are too few vegetables, they can be purchased from other places and sold on the market. The relationship between the Vegetable Company and the vegetable cooperatives and vegetable retailers in the city should become a very simple business relationship.

Some people may ask: Will this develop capitalism? No. Because private commerce is now under joint state-private ownership, and vegetable farmers have also been cooperativized. Under this circumstance, restoring the free market will not generate capitalism.

Fan Guangdou

Direct Producer-Consumer Contact

The Beijing Vegetable Company's implementation of the method of purchasing, marketing all vegetables and supplying designated areas has played a certain role in guaranteeing supply, guaranteeing the income of vegetable farmers, and stabilizing vegetable prices. However, judging from the current situation of complete agricultural cooperativization, the organization of vegetable merchants and peddlers, and the urgent demand of consumers for a complete range of fresh vegetables, this method of purchasing and marketing all vegetables is no longer suitable. In order to promote the enthusiasm of both production and sales in operation and meet the needs of consumers, the method of purchasing and marketing all vegetables should be abolished in a timely manner and changed to an organized and planned free purchase market. Vendors and consumers can directly meet producers in the free market, and the highest price should be controlled by the state. Vegetables of particularly good quality can also be sold at prices exceeding the state price according to consumer needs. In this way, production technology can be promoted and improved, the income of producers can be guaranteed, and consumers can eat fresh vegetables.

### 对改进蔬菜供应的建议

专栏：读者来信

    对改进蔬菜供应的建议
    编者按　自从本报连续发表了关于北京市蔬菜供应问题的意见后，我们接到不少读者来信，提出今后改进蔬菜供应的具体意见。我们希望有关部门重视研究这些意见，改进蔬菜的供应工作。
    国家经营和自由贸易相结合
    看到人民日报7月30日宋光炜同志的“怎样改进蔬菜供应工作”一文和9月1日人民日报几篇关于北京市蔬菜供应工作的意见后，我有如下意见。
    北京市是今年开始对郊区蔬菜合作社进行包购包销的。要这样做的基本理由是：可以保证菜农收入，对生产者有利；可以统一掌握货源，稳定市场物价，对消费者有利。根据现在的情况看来，这些理由都是脱离实际的。
    首先，统购包销并没有保证菜农的合理收入。据蒲黄榆和东方红生产社主任反映：今年旺季由于批发站“压筐”太久，生产社就烂掉西红柿、苤蓝等各种蔬菜一百二十万斤。
    北京市蔬菜公司为了保证菜农收入，在收购和批发的差价上，还赔了不少钱。我认为今后只有采取国家经营一部分蔬菜，其余允许菜农直接卖给零售单位和消费者的办法，才有利于生产者。在旺季，菜若有了剩余或价格过低，影响菜农收入时，国营商业可以采取收购、加工、外调或贴补的办法，保证菜农的收入。
    其次，认为统购包销可以统一掌握货源，稳定市场的理由也是立不住脚的。因为稳定市场，决定于：足够的蔬菜生产基地；有利于蔬菜商品流转的经营方法；合理地分布商业网，发挥零售环节中各个成员的积极性。以上几个问题解决了，同时采取国家自营和组织产销直接买卖相结合的形式，就可以保证市场的稳定。应该认识到：所谓市场稳定，是指主要大路蔬菜稳定在一定的合理的价格水平上，决不是所有蔬菜的价格一律不动。
    有人可能要问：这样做，在淡季是否会发生市场波动呢？这种顾虑也是多余的。因为，一、郊区菜农都已组成高级生产社，零售商贩也已组成联购联销或联购分销小组。二、在淡季，国营公司可适当扩大主要蔬菜的经营比重，加上国营商业所掌握的外地货源（南菜北运），以及豆制加工品等，同样可以保证市场的合理稳定。
    我希望北京市有关部门迅速研究群众的意见，采取有效措施改进工作。　孙建
    恢复国家领导下的自由市场
    我提出一个解决蔬菜供应的办法，供大家研究。
    我的具体意见是：改组蔬菜公司为蔬菜管理处。它在市内仅负责管理蔬菜市场，合理规定蔬菜市场价格，及必要时掌握议价，不再和郊区蔬菜合作社定购或收购。郊区各蔬菜合作社生产的菜，可自由到市内各菜市场出售（但严禁到市场外出售），形成几个在蔬菜管理处领导下的批发市场。卖菜的零售店（包括国营及公私合营），每天派人上菜市买菜，店小的，可几家派一人上菜市，取消现在经过公司统一调拨的办法。菜贩可凭证到指定菜市购买。小贩的出售地区，不受限制，可适当地把他们组织成为联购分销，各负盈亏的合作小组。
    蔬菜公司改成管理处后，可多利用市场价值法则。菜上市多了，可大量收购，运到外埠出售，或收购易储的蔬菜在本市储藏；菜少了，可向外地采购来在市场吐货。蔬菜公司同本市各蔬菜合作社及蔬菜零售商的关系，应变成很简单的业务关系。
    可能有人要问：这样是不是会发展资本主义呢？不会。因为现在私人商业已公私合营，菜农也已合作化，在这种情况下，恢复自由市场，是不会产生资本主义的。
                          范光斗
    产销直接见面
    北京市蔬菜公司对蔬菜实行包购、包销，定点划片供应的办法，在保证供应，保证菜农收入，稳定菜价上起了一定的作用。但是，从目前农业已全部合作化，菜商菜贩已组织起来，消费者迫切要求供应品种齐全的新鲜蔬菜等情况看来，这种包购包销的办法已不适用了。为促使产销双方在经营上的积极性、满足消费者的需要，应及时取消包购包销的办法，变为有组织有计划的自由选购市场。贩卖者、消费者可以到自由市场和生产者直接见面，最高价格应由国家掌握。质量特别好的蔬菜也可根据消费者需要，超出国家牌价出售。这样，就能促使生产技术提高，保证生产者的收入，又能使消费者吃到新鲜的蔬菜。
