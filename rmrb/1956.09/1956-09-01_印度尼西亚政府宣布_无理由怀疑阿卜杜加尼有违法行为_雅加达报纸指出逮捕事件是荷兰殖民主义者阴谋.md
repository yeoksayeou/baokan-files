    雅加达报纸指出逮捕事件是荷兰殖民主义者阴谋
    据新华社雅加达31日电　印度尼西亚政府今天发表公报说，内阁在今天举行的特别会议上，一致同意特别委员会宣布没有理由怀疑外交部长阿卜杜加尼有违法行为的声明。因此内阁决定，阿卜杜加尼应当尽早前往参加目前在苏联访问的由苏加诺总统率领的代表团。
    检察总长苏普拉普托在另一份声明中也说：“我们认为没有理由对阿卜杜加尼先生采取法律行动。”
    在阿卜杜加尼最近动身前往参加伦敦会议前夕，当时的第三军区司令卡维拉朗曾经在8月13日下令以贪污罪名逮捕他。
    据新华社雅加达30日电　“印度尼西亚火炬报”今天说，8月13日发生的有人想以贪污罪名逮捕印度尼西亚外交部长阿卜杜加尼事件，是荷兰殖民主义者的颠复性阴谋的一部分，这种阴谋的目的是想通过非民主的和非议会的途径来推翻印度尼西亚政府。
