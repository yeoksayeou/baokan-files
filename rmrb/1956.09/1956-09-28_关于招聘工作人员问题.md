Answering Readers' Questions:

    Q: Which provinces and cities are conducting recruitment work?
    A: In addition to the eleven cities originally designated in the announcement to conduct recruitment, namely Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Shenyang, Harbin, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Xi'an, Chengdu, Kunming, and Fuzhou, the State Council has subsequently approved Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Guizhou, Jiangxi, Hunan, and Shanxi provinces to also establish staff recruitment committees to directly handle recruitment work. Shandong Province is preparing to establish a recruitment agency. Those who voluntarily apply should complete the application procedures in their own province or city; if their province or city does not have a recruitment agency, they should complete the application procedures at the recruitment agency in a neighboring province or city.

    Q: Can those who meet the application requirements but are not within the scope of recruitment specified in the announcement apply?
    A: In order to mobilize all forces to actively participate in the cause of socialist construction, those who meet the application requirements but are not within the scope of recruitment specified in the announcement are also welcome to apply at the provincial and municipal staff recruitment committees. The provincial and municipal staff recruitment committees will contact relevant departments for review and consider whether to employ them.

    Q: What languages are the recruited translators required to master?
    A: The recruited translators cover all fields. Translators of any foreign language or any domestic minority language are welcome to apply.

    Q: Can those who do not meet the application requirements apply for assistance with employment?
    A: This recruitment work is to recruit senior intellectuals and people with specialized skills; it is not to generally handle labor employment issues. Therefore, those who do not meet the application requirements cannot apply. Their employment issues should be handled by contacting the relevant labor departments.
