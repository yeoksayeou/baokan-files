People in disaster areas in Jiangsu, Henan, Heilongjiang and other provinces
Overcome difficulties to rebuild their homes and resume production

(Our report) Jiangsu, Henan, Heilongjiang and other provinces are vigorously carrying out post-disaster recovery work, leading the people to rebuild their homes and resume production.

The post-disaster recovery work in the disaster areas of Jiangsu Province, which suffered from the typhoon, is continuing. Houses destroyed and knocked down by the typhoon are generally repaired quickly. Each agricultural cooperative in Ganyu County adopted mutual aid in finding work, taking the small team as a unit to solve the difficulty of insufficient labor, so that most of the disaster-stricken houses have been repaired, and some agricultural cooperatives have completely repaired the damaged houses. The houses blown down in the province have been basically restored, and 20% to 30% of the collapsed houses have been repaired. In Songjiang Special District alone, 70,000 houses have been repaired. During this period, nearly 3.48 million yuan of relief funds were distributed throughout the province, enabling disaster victims who lacked food and were unable to repair their houses to rebuild their homes.

Jiangsu disaster areas are continuing to take various measures to rush planting and harvesting. Dongtai County, on the one hand, mobilized the masses to apply soil and fertilizer, and on the other hand, mobilized the masses to rush to plant late autumn crops. The county has rushed to plant more than 11,500 mu of buckwheat, radish, sweet potato, autumn beans, and mung beans. Many agricultural cooperatives in Nanhui County lit gasoline lamps at night to rush to harvest rice. At the same time, many disaster areas also mobilized the masses to sweep up the rice that was blown down by the wind. Yangzhou Special District estimates that 60 million jin of fallen rice can be swept up. In order to further support the people in the disaster areas to rebuild their homes and resume production, the Jiangsu Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative once proposed a stock of 50,000 mao bamboo to supply the disaster areas. Songjiang Special District has decided to allocate a loan of 5 million yuan, and the supply and marketing cooperative has distributed more than 12 million jin of chemical fertilizers to various disaster areas to rescue disaster-stricken crops.

After the rescue work in Henan Province ended, it fully launched post-disaster recovery work in the disaster areas. In Anyang Special District, which was the most severely affected by the flood, it vigorously organized disaster victims to return to their hometowns when the water receded. So far, more than 230,000 of the 250,000 disaster victims who were relocated in the district have returned to their hometowns. Now the disaster area is busy repairing houses and restoring agricultural production. According to incomplete statistics from Neihuang, Junxian, and Anyang counties alone, more than 88,000 reed mats have been issued to disaster victims for building houses, more than 9,900 houses have been repaired, and more than 70,000 disaster victims have been resettled. Yuanyang County organized 843 house repair teams to help disaster victims repair more than 7,900 houses. Mao Tan Agricultural Cooperative in Heyangshan Township of the county has repaired more than 1,000 collapsed and damaged houses in the cooperative, allowing the cooperative members to settle down.

In terms of drainage and rush planting, Xinyang, Shangqiu, Kaifeng and other special districts have completed drainage of more than 11 million mu of waterlogged land (incomplete statistics), accounting for more than 60% of the flooded area. Xinyang, Shangqiu, and Xinxiang special districts have rushed to plant more than 690,000 mu of crops such as buckwheat and vegetables. Neihuang and other eight counties in Anyang Special District launched disaster victims to plant 95,000 mu of vegetables and more than 16,000 mu of buckwheat soon after the rescue work ended.

Party and government leading organs and economic departments at all levels in Henan Province attach great importance to the work of rebuilding homes and restoring production for the people in the disaster areas. The Henan Provincial People's Committee has allocated all 7 million yuan of relief funds allocated by the central government to the disaster areas. Recently, it decided to transfer 600,000 jin of buckwheat seeds to support the disaster areas and help solve the difficulty of planting late autumn crops. The Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative transferred 100,000 straw mats to supply the disaster areas.

After the flood situation in Heilongjiang Province stabilized, the focus of work in the disaster areas shifted to drainage and seedling protection and restoration of production. After the disaster, Zhaodong County transferred 250 cadres to organize more than 6,000 people to rush to repair more than 30 small dams and 250 drainage ditches, and has rescued 5,400 hectares of crops, with an average of 50% to 60% yield per hectare. Lanxi County has 23,000 hectares of flooded land. After actively mobilizing the masses to drain and protect seedlings, it has ensured that 15,000 hectares can still yield about 50%. Wuchang, Hailun, Qing'an, Qinggang and other counties that have suffered from waterlogging are now carrying out waterlogging drainage work, and more than 27,900 hectares of accumulated water have been drained. In order to solve the living difficulties of some disaster victims, these counties have organized more than 2,000 people to engage in sideline production such as firewood cutting, road repair, thatch making, and foreign grass making, with an income of more than one yuan per person per day.

    江苏、河南、黑龙江等省灾区人民
    克服困难重建家园恢复生产
    本报讯　江苏、河南、黑龙江等省灾区大力展开善后恢复工作，领导人民重建家园，恢复生产。
    遭受台风灾害的江苏省灾区善后恢复工作正在继续进行。为台风刮坏刮倒的房屋一般修复得很快。赣榆县各农业社采取以小队为单位互助找工，解决劳动力不足的困难，使大部分的受灾房屋已经修理起来，有的农业社已经把损坏的房屋完全修好。全省被风刮坏的房屋已经基本恢复，刮倒的房屋已修复了20％到30％。仅松江专区已经修复的房屋就有七万间。在这个期间，全省发放了将近三百四十八万元的救济款，使缺乏口粮、无力修复房屋的灾民得以重建家园。
    江苏灾区正在继续采取各种措施，抢种抢收。东台县一面发动群众拥土追肥，一面发动群众抢种晚秋，全县抢种下的荞麦、萝卜、山芋、秋豆、绿豆已达一万一千五百多亩。南汇县许多农业社在夜晚点起汽油灯抢收水稻。与此同时，许多灾区还发动群众打扫被风吹落的稻谷。扬州专区估计能打扫的落谷有六千万斤。为进一步支援灾区人民重建家园恢复生产，江苏省供销社曾提出库存毛竹五万根供应灾区。松江专区已决定拨发贷款五百万元，供销社已将一千二百多万斤化学肥料分送各灾区，抢救受灾作物。
    河南省抢救工作结束后，全力开展灾区善后恢复工作。受水灾最重的安阳专区，在水势回落时，就大力组织灾民还乡，到目前为止，全区移出的二十五万灾民，已有二十三万多人还乡。现在灾区正忙于修复房屋和恢复农业生产。仅据内黄、浚县、安阳等三县不完全统计，已发给灾民盖房芦席八万八千多张，修盖房屋九千九百多间，安置灾民七万多人。原阳县组织八百四十三个修房小组，帮助灾民修复房屋七千九百余间，该县黑羊山乡毛滩农业社已将全社倒塌和损坏的一千多间房屋都修好，使社员们安居下来。
    在排水抢种方面，信阳、商丘、开封等专区已完成排除渍水一千一百多万亩（不完全统计），占被淹面积的60％以上。信阳、商丘、新乡三专区已抢种了荞麦、蔬菜等作物六十九万多亩。安阳专区的内黄等八县，抢救工作刚结束不久，就发动灾民种植蔬菜九万五千亩，荞麦一万六千多亩。
    河南省各级党政领导机关和经济部门，对灾区人民重建家园和恢复生产的工作，十分重视。河南省人民委员会已把中央拨给的七百万元救济款全部下拨灾区。近来，又决定调运荞麦种六十万斤支援灾区帮助解决播种晚秋的困难。省供销社调出席子十万张供应灾区。
    黑龙江省在水情转趋稳定后，灾区工作主要转向排水救苗与恢复生产。肇东县灾后抽调干部二百五十名组织六千多人抢修小堤三十多条，排水沟二百五十道，已救出庄稼五千四百公顷，平均每公顷还可收五至六成。兰西县水淹地二万三千公顷，经过积极发动群众排水救苗，保证了一万五千公顷仍可收五成左右。遭受内涝的五常、海伦、庆安、青冈等县现在正在进行排涝工作，已经排除积水的田有两万七千九百余公顷。这些县为了解决部分灾民生活困难，共组织了二千多人从事打柴、修公路、打房草、洋草等副业生产，每人每天都有一元多的收入。（鲁江）
