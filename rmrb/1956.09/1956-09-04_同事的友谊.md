    Friendship Among Colleagues
　　Mǎ Tiědīng
    It is said that in a certain unit, there is a very subtle relationship between two main leaders—they don't talk when they meet, they don't nod when they encounter each other on the road, they don't clash in speeches during meetings, and the children of the two families, whose residences are extremely close, don't interact either; and neither of the two reveals this subtle relationship.
    Over time, this symptom of "generals at odds" inevitably alarms the surrounding "Yu Qings." However, the first and second inquirers received answers from both sides that were "Nothing, it's all good!" The third person spent a lot of effort to find an explanation.
    One said: "I am never ambiguous on matters of principle. As for personal relationships, that is secondary."
    The other said: "I have done my best. I guarantee unity on principle."
    Having said this much of the story, our two comrades seem to have nothing more to say. It is true that things are sometimes seen where personal discord leads to sacrifices of principle. Thinking of this, we really must thank them for their intention to take care of "principle" or "unity on principle."
    But, to ask: Can the "subtle" relationship between these two leaders, and the need for it to remain so "subtle," truly take care of "principle" or "unity on principle"?
    This is greatly worrying.
    Here, the word "friendship" must be mentioned. Speaking of "friendship," in the minds of some comrades, it is still a mixture of "naivete" and "petty-bourgeois consciousness." But, in my opinion, to do a good job of a common cause, friendship between colleagues (especially between leaders) is indispensable. Lacking it, there is often, perhaps inevitably, a lack of principle. Of course, the friendship we are talking about can only be comradely friendship, built on the foundation of principles, and not other kinds of friendship.
    Deep friendship is indeed greatly related to each other's personalities, and it cannot be established casually. But a basic, harmonious friendship for working together seamlessly can and should exist between any colleagues working together.
    It is necessary to talk about principles, discipline, and regulations, but we must not forget to talk about friendship. Friendship is not something that is dispensable in our collective.

    同事的友谊
　　马铁丁
    听说某单位两个主要负责人之间，有一种很微妙的关系——见面不谈话，在路上碰见不点头，一起开会时发言不交锋，住处极近的两家的孩子也不走动；而这种微妙的关系，两个人谁也不吐露。
    久而久之，这种“将相不和”的征候，终究不能不惊动周围的“虞卿”们。可是，第一、第二个问询者从两个方面得到的回答都是“没有什么呀，还好嘛！”第三个费了好大力气才找到了解释。
    一个说：“在原则问题上，我是决不含糊的。至于私人关系，那是次要的。”
    另一个说：“我已经尽了最大的努力了。我保证在原则上团结一致。”
    故事说到这里，我们这两位同志似乎无话可说了。由于私人的不和而以原则作牺牲的事，的确不是没有见过。想到这一点，我们真要感谢他们顾全“原则”或“在原则上团结一致”的用心了。
    但是，要问：这两位负责人的“微妙”关系，而且还要如此“微妙”下去，果真能够顾全“原则”或“在原则上团结一致”吗？
    这是大大令人担心的。
    这里，不能不提到“友谊”两个字。说起“友谊”，在一部分同志的心目中，还是“幼稚”和“小资产阶级意识”的混合物。但是，依我看，要把共同的事业做好，共事的同志之间（尤其是负责人之间）的友谊是缺少不得的。缺少它，经常地、也许是必然地要缺少原则性。当然，我们说的友谊，只能是同志的、建筑在原则基础上的友谊，而不是别的友谊。
    深厚的友谊，的确与彼此的个性有很大的关系，不是随便可以建立起来的。但起码的、融洽无间地共事的友谊，在任何共事同志之间都能够有、应当有。
    讲原则、讲纪律、讲规章，都是需要的，但也不能忘了讲友谊。友谊，在我们的集体中，这不是可有可无的东西。
