    Emphasize Metrological Work
    Accurate measuring tools and instruments are of considerable importance to economic construction, national defense construction, scientific research, and other work. However, many people now do not pay enough attention to metrological work. Some people think: "Weights and measures are just rulers, dou [a unit of dry measure], and scales. It doesn't matter whether they are managed or not!" Some people think: "It doesn't matter much if the measurement isn't accurate; it's not a big deal." As a result, many units are afraid of trouble and spending money, and are unwilling to accept the verification of measuring tools and instruments. As a result, the inaccurate state of measuring tools and instruments in many units has reached an alarming degree, which has caused a lot of losses in work. According to the statistics of regular inspections in Liaoning Province in 1955 and the first half of this year, more than 90% of weighbridges in general areas are unqualified, about 80% of platform scales are unqualified, and about 70% of balances are unqualified. Because the weighbridge was inaccurate, Shenyang Smelter used 1,600 tons less of raw materials in a year, which not only resulted in the underproduction of more than 190 tons of copper, but also overpaid piecework wages, resulting in inventory discrepancies; the No. 1 workshop of Shenyang Grain Processing Factory overpaid more than 194,400 kilograms of flour in a month because the platform scale used to weigh the flour was inaccurate.
    Enterprises and institutions in various places should learn from these lessons, and conduct strict verification of newly manufactured and repaired measuring tools and instruments. Regular verification should be carried out for measuring tools and instruments that may change during use. Measuring tools and instruments that are used frequently and measure special items should also apply to metrological authorities for temporary verification within a certain period (such as half a year or a quarter).

    重视计量工作
    准确的量具计器，对经济建设、国防建设、科学研究等工作有相当重要的作用。可是，现在有很多人对计量工作不够重视。有的人认为：“度量衡就是尺、斗、秤，管不管没啥！”有的人认为：“计量准不准关系不大，这不是什么了不起的问题。”因此，许多单位怕麻烦，怕花钱，不愿意接受对量具计器的检定。结果就使不少单位量具计器不准的情况达到惊人的程度，工作中也因此造成了不少的损失。据辽宁省1955年和今年上半年定期检定的统计，一般地区地秤90％以上不合格，台秤80％左右不合格，天平70％左右不合格。沈阳冶炼厂因地秤不准，一年少投料一千六百多吨，不但少产铜一百九十多吨，而且多付了计件工资，造成盘存不符的现象；沈阳粮谷加工厂第一车间因为过面粉用的台秤不准，一个月就多付出面粉十九万四千四百多公斤。
    各地企业、机关应该接受这些教训，对新制的和修理的量具计器进行严格的检定，对使用中可能发生变化的量具计器要进行定期检定，使用频繁和计量特殊物品的量具计器，还应该在一定期间（如半年或一个季度）申请计量机关作临时检定。
