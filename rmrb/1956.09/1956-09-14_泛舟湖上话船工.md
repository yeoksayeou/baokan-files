Title: Boating on the Lake, Talking About Boatmen

	One of the delightful things to do in Beijing is to gather two or three companions on a summer evening and rent a small boat to row in the park. At this time, the heat has passed, a gentle breeze is blowing, and the afterglow of the setting sun reflects dazzling light on the slightly rippling water. You and your companions, steering the boat, either gently row, or let it drift, sitting or lying down, looking around, singing or musing, feeling infinitely comfortable and washing away the fatigue of the day.
	But for four or five days after August 8th, whether in Taoranting, Jinyuchi, Longtan Lake, or Zhongshan Park, the lake water remained the same, but it was empty and desolate, and not a single boat was to be seen. What's going on? Could it be a strike? I heard that there were still a few boats for rent in Beihai and the Summer Palace, but they were far away and presumably in short supply, so I decided not to go.
	Recently, I met Wang Yong'an and learned the truth. It turned out that these small boats had unprecedentedly left Beijing and went to Daxing County nearby to do something unforgettable for the local people – rescue people, because several villages there were flooded by the Yongding River.
	Rescuing people is almost a daily routine for Wang Yong'an. Normally, he is just a boatman in the park, not a lifeguard. But when the weather suddenly changes, and one or two small boats carrying tourists who cannot row back are about to capsize in the wind and rain; or even when the wind is calm and the waves are quiet, but someone accidentally falls into the water and is about to drown; can people who are familiar with the water remain indifferent? Such things happen at least twenty or thirty times a year in each park, and Wang Yong'an and some boatmen are familiar with the water, so they have a duty to include rescuing people in their job responsibilities. Wang Yong'an has been a boatman in the park for thirty years, and he has rescued at least several hundred people.
	Do these hundreds of rescued people know who rescued them? Most don't know. How could they know? When they are pulled out of the water, they are mostly confused. The boatmen hand them over to the police to be transferred to the hospital or their families, and the boatmen have fulfilled their duties. Before liberation, the rescued people often gave money to the police, thinking that the lifesaver was either the police or some righteous tourist, never imagining that it would be the boatmen who repair small boats on the shore or manage small boats at the dock. But there was a young couple who clearly remembered Wang Yong'an's appearance. That time, there was also a storm, but the "brewing" time was long, and people were able to row back calmly. This young couple couldn't row, and until the rain became heavy and the waves high, the small boat was still spinning in the middle of Beihai. The wind and rain were unusually strong. Fortunately, the wind was a whirlwind and didn't capsize the boat for a while. No one dared to go into the water from the shore. It was Wang Yong'an who stepped into the water and desperately grabbed the small boat to pull it ashore, so that they escaped the danger. The young couple, their spirits barely recovered, took out two silver dollars to give him. Wang Yong'an refused. He believed that this was part of his job, not a transaction.
	He has rescued so many people and never asked for any reward. How noble! How heroic! But Wang Yong'an himself was not aware of it. He was aware of one thing, that his life was getting better and better, and he was getting more and more respect. He often lovingly encouraged his son and daughter who were in school: "Hey, kids, study hard. No one in our Wang family has ever gone to school. I'm just starting to learn to read!" Indeed, no one in his family had ever been literate before. Generations were all boatmen on grain transport ships, all water heroes, bold, but poor. His father's generation didn't quite catch up with the grain transport ships. Some pulled rickshaws, some became carpenters, and life was even harder. He grew up tumbling in the Yongding River (his family lived by the Yongding River), and developed a skill in the water. He started working and earning money at the age of six or seven, picking coal, scavenging, pulling rickshaws, running errands specifically to pick up balls when rich people's young masters and young ladies played tennis, and working as an apprentice, but he never ate a meal of white flour. At the age of seventeen, he followed his uncle to work as a boatman in Beihai Park. At that time, only Beihai in the city had boating activities, but the park was desolate and the water was turbid. There were only a few small boats that were bulky and heavy, and there were even fewer boatmen. They worked hard to design and build lightweight boats themselves, and the manager kept them. They never expected that this industry would develop to such a scale now. Now Wang Yong'an is the leader of the boatmen's group in Zhongshan Park. People call him Wang Tou'er (Head Wang). When they mention him, the boatmen give a thumbs up. There are only five or six boatmen like him who are capable of everything in the whole city. Do you want to see him? Look, he's such an "ordinary" appearance: a face full of beard, a head full of oily sweat, skin all over his body black and rough, and already fat, wearing a vest and a pair of shorts, a pair of narrow eyes, constantly smiling, simple but talkative, and likes to drink two ounces of white liquor before each meal... In short, he is completely an ordinary working people, but a true hero!
	Tonight I am boating on the lake again. The moon is bright, the water is calm, and the breeze brings distant music. I think of Wang Yong'an, and I think of our country, and I can't help but feel a sense of pride. I want to tell the tourists on the lake loudly, after you have enjoyed yourselves, look around at the shore and the surroundings, and find these nameless giants who seem to be by our side at all times. They carefully build遊boats for us, and are always watching our safety on the water!

    泛舟湖上话船工
    白卉
    在北京，赏心乐事之一，是在夏天的傍晚，邀集三、二同伴，到公园里去租一只小船划划。这时炎热已过，清风徐来，落日的余晖映照在微微跃动着的水面上，反射出耀眼的光彩；你和同伴们驾着小船，或者轻摇双桨，或者任它荡漾，坐着或者躺着，极目四眺，唱着或者遐思着，只觉心头无限舒畅，一天的疲累洗尽了。
    但是在8月8日以后四、五日间，无论是陶然亭、金鱼池、龙潭湖、中山公园，湖水依旧，只是空空荡荡，一只小船的影踪也不见。这是怎么回事？莫非罢了工？听说北海、颐和园还有少量船只出租，可是路远，且想必供不应求，不去也罢。
    最近遇到王永安，才知原委。原来这些小船都破天荒地离开北京，到附近大兴县去干了一件叫当地人民难忘的事情——救人，因为那里有几个村子被永定河水淹了。
    救人，这在王永安简直是家常便饭的事。按说，他只是公园里的一个船工，不是救生员。但当天气突变，一、二只小船载着不及划回的游人在狂风暴雨里即将倾复的时候；或者虽然风平浪静，但有人失足落水即将灭顶的时候；熟识水性的人们能无动于衷吗？这样的事，每个公园每年至少发生二、三十起，而王永安和有一些船工都谙识水性，因此也就义不容辞地把救人这项工作列进自己的职务范围里去了。王永安在公园里当了三十来年船工，经他手救起的人，少说也有几百个了。
    这千百个被救的人知道被谁救起的吗？大都不知道。怎么能知道呢？他们在水中被捞起时，大都已经神志迷糊，船工把他们交给警察转送医院或者家属，船工们的职责就尽到了。解放前，被救的人常常送钱给警察，他们以为救命恩人不是警察就是不知哪个仗义的游人，
  万想不到会是那些在岸上修造小船或是在码头上管理小船的船工。但是有一对青年男女，清楚地记得王永安的模样。那次也是暴风雨，只是“酝酿”时间久，人们都能从容划回。这对青年不会划，直到雨急浪高，小船还在北海当中打转。风雨异乎寻常地厉害。幸而风是旋风，一时没能把船翻了。岸上没有人敢下水。是王永安踩着水，死命揪住这小船往岸上拉，才使他们脱离了险境。这对青年惊魂甫定，摸出两块大洋奉送。王永安拒绝了。他认为，这是份内事，不是买卖。
    救过那么多人，又从来没要过报酬，多么高尚！多么英雄！可是王永安自己毫未意识到。他意识到一宗事，就是生活愈过愈好了，自己愈来愈被人尊重了。他常常爱抚地鼓励正在上学的一子一女：“嗨，孩子们，好好念书啊，咱们王家代代从没个上过学的人，我也才开始识字哩！”的确，他家从前没有一个知书识字的人，祖祖辈辈全是运粮船上的船工，全是水上英雄，豪迈，但是困苦。他父亲一代没有完全赶上运粮船，有的拉洋车，有的做木匠去了，生活更加困苦。他自小在永定河里翻腾（他家就住在永定河畔），练成一身水里的本领。六、七岁就开始干活挣钱，拣过煤，拾过荒，拉过洋车，给有钱人家少爷少姐打网球时专门跑腿拾球，当过学徒，可是没吃上过一顿白面。十七岁上，才跟着叔叔到北海公园做船工。那时全市只有北海有划船的玩艺，可是园荒水浊，寥寥几只小划子又笨又重，船工更没有几个。他们苦心经营，自己设计修造轻便小船，经理才把他们留下了。他们料不到这行业发达到了现在这般规模。现在王永安是中山公园船工组长，人都称他王头儿。提起他，船工们竖个大姆指，像他这样件件皆能的船工，现在全市不过五、六个。你想见见他吗？你瞧，他是这么个“平凡”的样儿：满脸胡髭，一头油汗，全身皮肉又黑又粗，而且已经发胖，穿一件汗衫一条短裤衩，一双细眼，一个劲儿迷迷笑，言语质朴，但是健谈，每顿饭前好喝二两白干……。总之，完完全全是普通的劳动人民，但是个真正的英雄！
    今夜我又泛舟湖上，月色皎洁，水面平静，微风送来远处音乐，我想起王永安，想起我们国家，不觉有一种自豪感。我想大声告诉湖上的游人们，你们在尽情欢乐之后，放眼看看岸上和四周，找一找这些好像随时都在我们身旁的无名巨人，他们为我们精心修造游船，并且刻刻注视着我们在水上的安全！
