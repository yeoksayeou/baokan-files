    Conducting Criticism and Promoting Democratic Traditions
    Zao Yuan Township, Yan'an, Completes Elections
    According to Xinhua News Agency, Zao Yuan Township in Yan'an County, where the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao once resided, completed the election of representatives to the township's Second People's Congress on August 30th.
    Zao Yuan Township completed the election this year in twenty days. The number of voters participating in the election reached 97.3% of the total number of voters. During the election process, the people of the entire township promoted democratic traditions, conducted full deliberation and repeated comparisons of representative candidates, and extensively carried out criticism and self-criticism, seriously examining the work of the government and the work style of cadres. The people of the entire township put forward more than four hundred opinions and requests, concentrating and sharply criticizing the cadres' coercive orders and bureaucratic work style. Voters in Pei Zhuang and Zao Yuan Village, when criticizing the bureaucratic work style of cadres, said that since the basic realization of agricultural cooperation in the whole township, many township cadres, after going to the countryside, only sought out the leaders of agricultural cooperatives to understand the situation, and did not get close to the general masses. This spring, more than ninety individual peasant households in the whole township had many difficulties in production and life because the leaders of individual agricultural cooperatives had ideological sentiments that discriminated against individual peasants, thus isolating these individual peasants. Although the township cadres understood these problems, they did not seriously study and solve them. Voters in Liu Jiahe Village said that this spring, thirty-seven peasant households in this village lacked food, but the township cadres took an indifferent attitude towards these difficulties of the members.
    After this criticism, many township cadres immediately made self-criticisms to the masses regarding errors and shortcomings in their work, and also went door-to-door to "visit the virtuous and ask about suffering," listening to the opinions of the masses. The criticisms and suggestions put forward by the voters were also handled and answered separately. Through the election, a total of twenty-nine new representatives who satisfied the masses were elected. Among them, fifteen representatives were activists who emerged during the high tide of agricultural cooperativization. Among the re-elected representatives, Zhao Xiangcai, who served as the township head in the previous term, was able to endure hardship and work hard, but he was slow in handling affairs and afraid of offending people. The masses said that he was a township head who "did not handle disputes." After this criticism, Zhao Xiangcai went to various electoral districts to make a self-criticism to the masses and put forward methods for improving his work in the future, which then gained the trust of the masses and was elected. The work of Xie Hongyuan and Gao Xingde, representatives of the previous term, was consistently perfunctory and their attitude was stiff. After the masses criticized them this time, they were unwilling to humbly accept the opinions of the masses, and as a result, they failed to be elected.

    开展批评发扬民主传统
    延安枣园乡选举完成
    据新华社讯　中共中央和毛主席曾经住过的延安县枣园乡，在8月30日完成了乡的第二届人民代表大会代表的选举。
    枣园乡今年用二十天的时间完成了选举。参加选举的选民达到选民总数的97.3％。全乡人民在选举过程中发扬了民主传统，对代表候选人进行了充分的酝酿和反复评比，并且广泛地开展了批评与自我批评，认真地检查了政府的工作和干部作风。全乡人民共提出了四百多条意见和要求，集中而尖锐地批评了干部的强迫命令和官僚主义作风。裴庄和枣园村的选民在批评干部的官僚主义作风时说，自从全乡农业基本上实现合作化以来，许多乡干部到农村后只找农业社的领导人了解情况，不接近一般群众。今春全乡有九十多户单干农民在生产上和生活上存在着许多困难，因为个别农业社的领导人有歧视单干农民的思想情绪，因而使这些单干农民陷于孤立。乡干部虽然了解这些问题，但是没有认真地进行研究解决。刘家河村的选民说，今年春天这个村有三十七户农民缺乏口粮，但是乡干部对社员的这些困难却采取漠不关心的态度。
    许多乡干部经过这次批评后，都立即向群众检讨了工作中的错误和缺点，同时还挨门逐户地“访贤问苦”，倾听群众意见。对选民提出的批评和建议，也分别作了处理和答复。经过选举，全乡共选出群众满意的二十九名新代表。其中有十五个代表是在农业合作化高潮中涌现出来的积极分子。在连选连任的代表中，担任前届乡长的赵相才在工作中虽能吃苦耐劳，但办事疲沓，怕得罪人，群众说他是“不理词讼”的乡长。经过这次批评后，赵相才到各选区去向群众作了检讨，并且提出了今后改进工作的办法，才获得了群众的信任而当选。上届代表谢宏元、高兴德等工作一贯马虎，态度生硬，这次群众提出批评后，他们又不肯虚心地接受群众意见，结果落选。
