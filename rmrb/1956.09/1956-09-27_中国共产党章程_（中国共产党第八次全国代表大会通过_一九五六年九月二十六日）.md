Constitution of the Communist Party of China
(Adopted by the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China on September 26, 1956)

General Program

The Communist Party of China is the advanced detachment of the working class of China, and the highest form of class organization of the Chinese working class. Its purpose is to realize socialism and communism in China.

The Communist Party of China takes Marxism-Leninism as its guide to action. Only Marxism-Leninism has correctly explained the laws of social development and correctly pointed out the path to realize socialism and communism. The Party adheres to the Marxist-Leninist dialectical materialism and historical materialism world outlook, and opposes the idealist and metaphysical world outlook. Marxism-Leninism is not a dogma, but a guide to action; it requires people to proceed from reality in the struggle to realize socialism and communism, to flexibly and creatively apply its principles to solve various problems in the actual struggle, and to continuously develop its theory. Therefore, the Party, in its activities, adheres to the principle of closely integrating the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolutionary struggle, and opposes any dogmatic or empiricist deviation.

The Communist Party of China, together with the people of the whole country, went through a long period of revolutionary struggle and revolutionary war, overthrew the rule of imperialism, feudalism and bureaucrat-capitalism in 1949, and established the People's Republic of China, a people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants. Subsequently, the Party led the masses of the people to complete the task of democratic revolution in the vast majority of the country, and achieved great successes in the struggle to build a socialist society. During the transition period from the founding of the People's Republic of China to the building of a socialist society, the Party's general task is to gradually complete the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce, and to gradually realize the industrialization of the country.

Now, our country's socialist transformation has achieved a decisive victory in all aspects. The task of the Communist Party of China is to continue to adopt correct methods, to transform the remaining part of capitalist ownership into ownership by the whole people, to transform the remaining part of individual laborers' ownership into collective ownership by the working masses, to completely eliminate the system of exploitation, and to prevent the roots of the system of exploitation from arising. In the process of building a socialist society, the principle of "from each according to his ability, to each according to his work" should be gradually realized; for all former exploiters, they should be transformed into self-reliant laborers through peaceful means. The Party must continue to pay attention to overcoming capitalist factors and influences from the economic, political and ideological aspects, and at the same time, it must resolutely strive to mobilize and unite all possible active forces that can be mobilized and united, in order to win the complete victory of the great socialist cause.

The victory of the socialist revolution has given the social productive forces an infinitely promising future for great development. The task of the Communist Party of China is to develop the national economy in a planned way, to realize the industrialization of the country as quickly as possible, to carry out the technological transformation of the national economy systematically and step by step, so that China has a powerful modern industry, modern agriculture, modern transportation, and modern national defense. In order to realize industrialization and strive for the continuous upsurge of the national economy, it is necessary to give priority to the development of heavy industry, and at the same time, it is necessary to pay attention to maintaining the correct proportion between the development of heavy industry and light industry, and between the development of the entire industry and agriculture. The Party must strive to promote the progress of science, culture, and technology in our country, and strive to catch up with the advanced level of the world in these aspects. The fundamental purpose of all the Party's work is to maximize the satisfaction of the people's material and cultural needs. Therefore, it is necessary to gradually and continuously improve the people's living conditions on the basis of production development, which is also a necessary condition for enhancing the people's enthusiasm for production.

Our country is a multi-ethnic country. Due to historical reasons, the development of many minority nationalities has been limited. The Communist Party of China must make special efforts to improve the status of all minority nationalities, help the autonomy of all ethnic minorities, strive to cultivate minority cadres, promote the economic and cultural development of all ethnic minorities, realize the complete equality of all nationalities, and consolidate the relationship of unity and friendship among all nationalities. The social reforms of all ethnic minorities should be completed by each ethnic minority according to its own wishes and taking steps suitable to its own ethnic characteristics. The Party opposes any great-Han chauvinist tendencies and local nationalist tendencies that hinder national unity, and special attention should be paid to preventing and correcting the great-Han chauvinist tendencies among Han nationality party members and state workers.

The Communist Party of China must tirelessly consolidate our country's people's democratic dictatorship, which is the guarantee of the victory of our country's socialist cause. The Party must fight for the greater development of the country's democratic life and the further improvement of the democratic system. The Party must consolidate the fraternal alliance of workers and peasants from all aspects, consolidate the united front of all patriotic forces, and consolidate the long-term cooperative relationship with all democratic parties and non-party democrats. Imperialists and counter-revolutionary remnants want to undermine the cause of our people. Therefore, the Party must raise revolutionary vigilance and carry out a serious struggle against the forces that endanger our country's independence and security and the elements that undermine our country's socialist construction. The Party must, together with the people of the whole country, complete the task of liberating Taiwan.

The Communist Party of China advocates a foreign policy of maintaining world peace and realizing peaceful coexistence among countries with different systems. The Party advocates establishing and developing diplomatic, economic, and cultural relations between our country and other countries in the world, and developing and consolidating the friendly relations between our people and the people of all countries in the world. The Party resolutely opposes the aggressive acts of imperialist countries against our country and their plans to prepare for a new war, supports the efforts of the people and governments of all countries in maintaining peace and developing friendly relations among countries, and sympathizes with all struggles in the world against imperialism and colonialism. The Party strives to develop and consolidate our country's friendship with countries of the peace, democracy, and socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, strengthen the solidarity of proletarian internationalism, learn from the experience of the world communist movement, and support the struggles of communists, progressives, and working people all over the world to promote human progress, and educate its party members and people with the internationalist spirit of "Workers of all countries, unite!"

The realization of all the propositions of the Communist Party of China must be achieved through the activities of the Party's organizations and members among the masses of the people, and through the conscious efforts of the masses of the people under the leadership of the Party. Therefore, it is necessary to continuously carry forward the tradition of the mass line in the Party's work. Whether the Party's leadership can remain correct depends on whether the Party can systematically concentrate the experience and opinions of the masses, after analysis and generalization, into the Party's propositions, and then, through the Party's propaganda and organizational work among the masses, turn them into the masses' own propositions and actions, and examine, supplement, and revise the Party's propositions in the actions of the masses. The responsibility of the Party's leadership is to be good at making the Party's and the masses' understanding continuously improve and the Party's and the people's cause continuously advance in this infinitely repeated process of "from the masses, to the masses." Therefore, the Communist Party of China and its members must establish extensive and close ties with workers, peasants, intellectuals, and other patriotic people, and constantly pay attention to expanding and consolidating this connection. Every party member should understand the consistency of the Party's interests and the people's interests, the consistency of being responsible to the Party and being responsible to the people, and must wholeheartedly serve the masses of the people, consult with the masses in everything, listen to the opinions of the masses, care about the suffering of the masses, and do their best to help the masses realize their demands. The Communist Party of China is already the ruling party, so it should pay special attention to being modest and prudent, guarding against arrogance and impatience, and fighting with great effort in every party organization, in every state organ and economic organization, against the phenomenon of bureaucracy that is divorced from the masses and divorced from practical life.

The organizational principle of the Communist Party of China is democratic centralism. This is centralism on the basis of democracy and democracy under the guidance of centralism. The Party must take effective measures to promote inner-Party democracy, encourage the initiative and creativity of all party members, Party grassroots organizations, and local organizations, and strengthen the lively connections between higher and lower levels. Only in this way can the Party's connection with the masses of the people be effectively expanded and strengthened, the Party's leadership be correct and timely, can it flexibly adapt to various specific situations and local characteristics, can the Party's life be vibrant, and can the Party's cause be developed greater and faster. Only on this basis can the Party's centralism and unity be consolidated, and the Party's discipline be conscious rather than mechanical. According to the Party’s democratic centralism, any Party organization must strictly abide by the principle of combining collective leadership and individual responsibility, and any Party member and Party organization must be subject to the supervision of the Party from top to bottom and from bottom to top.

The Party's democratic principles cannot be separated from the Party's centralism principles. The Party is a unified combat organization linked by the discipline that all party members must abide by; without discipline, the Party can never lead the country and the people to overcome powerful enemies and realize socialism and communism. The Party is the highest organization of the class, and it must strive to exert its correct leading role and core role in all aspects of national life, and oppose any tendency of decentralism that reduces the Party's role and weakens the Party's unity. The Party's unity is the life of the Party and the source of its strength. It is the sacred duty of every party member to constantly pay attention to maintaining the Party's unity and consolidating the Party's unification. No behavior that violates the Party's political line and organizational principles is allowed in the Party, and no behavior that splits the Party, engages in small organization activities, acts independently from the Party, or puts the individual above the Party's collective is allowed.

No political party and no individual will be without shortcomings and errors in their activities. The Communist Party of China and its members must frequently use the method of criticism and self-criticism to expose and eliminate their own shortcomings and errors, so as to educate themselves and the people. In view of the Party's leading position in national and social life, the Party needs to put strict demands on all its organizations and members even more, and it needs to unfold criticism and self-criticism even more, especially encouraging and supporting criticism from the bottom up within the Party and criticism of the Party by the people, and prohibiting behavior that suppresses criticism. The Party must prevent and resist the erosion of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideological styles, and prevent and overcome any right and "left" opportunist tendencies within the Party. For party members who have made mistakes, as long as the mistakes they have made can be corrected within the Party and they are willing to correct them, the Party should adopt the policy of curing the sickness to save the patient, keep them in the Party for education, and help them correct their mistakes; and for those elements who persist in not correcting their mistakes and carry out activities that endanger the Party, they must be resolutely struggled against, until they are expelled from the Party.

The Communist Party of China requires every party member to put the Party's interests above personal interests, work diligently and honestly, study hard, struggle hard, unite the broad masses, and overcome all difficulties, in order to build China into a great, prosperous, and advanced socialist country, and on this basis continue to move forward and realize the highest ideal of mankind - communism.

    中国共产党章程
    （中国共产党第八次全国代表大会通过——一九五六年九月二十六日）
    总纲
    中国共产党是中国工人阶级的先进部队，是中国工人阶级的阶级组织的最高形式。它的目的是在中国实现社会主义和共产主义。
    中国共产党以马克思列宁主义作为自己行动的指南。只有马克思列宁主义才正确地说明了社会发展的规律，正确地指出了实现社会主义和共产主义的道路。党坚持马克思列宁主义的辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义的世界观，反对唯心主义和形而上学的世界观。马克思列宁主义不是教条，而是行动的指南；它要求人们在实现社会主义和共产主义的斗争中从实际出发，灵活地、创造性地运用它的原理解决实际斗争中的各种问题，并且使它的理论不断地得到发展。因此，党在自己的活动中坚持马克思列宁主义的普遍真理同中国革命斗争的具体实践密切结合的原则，反对任何教条主义的或者经验主义的偏向。
    中国共产党同全国人民在一起，经过了长期的革命斗争和革命战争，在一九四九年推翻了帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的统治，建立了工人阶级领导的、以工农联盟为基础的、人民民主专政的中华人民共和国。接着，党领导人民群众在全国绝大部分地区内完成了民主革命的任务，并且在建立社会主义社会的斗争中取得了伟大的成就。在从中华人民共和国成立直到社会主义社会建成的过渡时期中，党的总任务，就是逐步完成对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，逐步实现国家的工业化。
    现在，我国的社会主义改造在各方面都已经取得了决定性的胜利。中国共产党的任务，是继续采取正确的方法，把资本家所有制的残余部分改变为全民所有制，把个体劳动者所有制的残余部分改变为劳动群众集体所有制，彻底消灭剥削制度，并且杜绝产生剥削制度的根源。在建成社会主义社会的过程中，应当逐步实现“各尽所能，按劳取酬”的原则；对于一切原有的剥削分子，应当通过和平的道路，把他们改造成为自食其力的劳动者。党必须继续注意从经济方面、政治方面和思想方面克服资本主义的因素和影响，同时必须坚决努力，动员和团结全国一切可能动员和团结的积极力量，以争取伟大的社会主义事业的完全胜利。
    社会主义革命的胜利给了社会生产力以巨大发展的无限前途。中国共产党的任务，就是有计划地发展国民经济，尽可能迅速地实现国家工业化，有系统、有步骤地进行国民经济的技术改造，使中国具有强大的现代化的工业、现代化的农业、现代化的交通运输业和现代化的国防。为了实现工业化和争取国民经济的不断高涨，必须优先发展重工业，同时对于发展重工业和轻工业，对于发展整个工业和农业，必须注意保持正确的比例。党必须努力促进我国的科学、文化、技术的进步，为在这些方面赶上世界的先进水平而奋斗。党的一切工作的根本目的，是最大限度地满足人民的物质生活和文化生活的需要，因此，必须在生产发展的基础上，逐步地和不断地改善人民的生活状况，而这也是提高人民生产积极性的必要条件。
    我国是多民族的国家。由于历史上的原因，许多少数民族的发展受到了限制。中国共产党必须用特别的努力来改善各少数民族的地位，帮助各少数民族的自治，努力培养少数民族的干部，促进各少数民族的经济和文化的发展，实现各民族的完全平等，巩固各民族的团结友爱关系。各民族的社会改革，应当由各民族按照自己的愿望，采取适合自己的民族特点的步骤去完成。党反对任何妨碍民族团结的大民族主义倾向和地方民族主义倾向，特别应当注意在汉民族的党员和国家工作人员中防止和纠正大汉族主义的倾向。
    中国共产党必须不倦地巩固我国的人民民主专政，这是我国社会主义事业胜利的保障。党必须为国家民主生活的更加发展和民主制度的更加完善而斗争。党必须从各方面巩固工人和农民的兄弟联盟，巩固一切爱国力量的统一战线，巩固同各民主党派和无党派民主人士长期合作的关系。帝国主义和反革命残余分子是要破坏我国人民的事业的，因此，党必须提高革命警惕性，同危害我国独立和安全的势力和破坏我国社会主义建设的分子进行严肃的斗争。党必须同全国人民在一起，完成解放台湾的任务。
    中国共产党主张维护世界和平、在不同制度的国家中间实现和平共处的外交政策。党主张建立和发展我国同世界各国之间的外交的、经济的、文化的关系，发展和巩固我国人民和世界各国人民之间的友好关系。党坚决反对帝国主义国家对于我国的侵略行为和它们准备新战争的计划，赞助各国人民和政府在维护和平和发展各国友好关系方面的努力，并且同情世界上一切反对帝国主义和反对殖民主义的斗争。党努力发展和巩固我国同以苏联为首的和平、民主、社会主义阵营各国的友谊，加强无产阶级国际主义的团结，学习世界共产主义运动的经验，支持全世界共产主义者、进步分子和劳动人民促进人类进步的奋斗，以“全世界无产者，联合起来！”的国际主义精神教育自己的党员和人民。
    中国共产党的一切主张的实现，都要通过党的组织和党员在人民群众中间的活动，都要通过人民群众在党的领导下的自觉的努力。因此，必须不断地发扬党的工作中的群众路线的传统。党的领导能否保持正确，决定于党能否把群众的经验和意见，经过分析和概括，系统地集中起来，变为党的主张，又经过党在群众中的宣传和组织工作，变为群众自己的主张和行动，并且在群众的行动中对党的主张加以检验、补充和修正。党的领导的责任，就是要善于在这个“从群众中来，到群众中去”的无限反复的过程中，使党和群众的认识不断地提高，使党和人民的事业不断地前进。因此，中国共产党和它的党员必须同工人、农民、知识分子和其他爱国人民建立广泛的密切的联系，并且经常注意扩大和巩固这种联系。每一个党员都应当理解党的利益和人民利益的一致性，对党负责和对人民负责的一致性，都必须全心全意地为人民群众服务，遇事同群众商量，倾听群众的意见，关心群众的痛痒，尽力帮助群众实现他们的要求。中国共产党已经是执政的党，因此特别应当注意谦虚谨慎，戒骄戒躁，并且用极大的努力在每一个党组织中，在每一个国家机关和经济组织中，同脱离群众、脱离实际生活的官僚主义现象进行斗争。
    中国共产党的组织原则是民主集中制。这就是在民主基础上的集中和在集中指导下的民主。党必须采取有效的办法发扬党内民主，鼓励一切党员、党的基层组织和地方组织的积极性和创造性，加强上下级之间的生动活泼的联系。只有这样，党同人民群众的联系才能有效地扩大和加强，党的领导才能正确和及时，才能灵活地适应各种具体情况和地方特点，党的生活才能生气勃勃，党的事业才能得到更大更快的发展。也只有在这个基础上，党的集中和统一才能巩固，党的纪律才能是自觉的而不是机械的。按照党的民主集中制，任何党的组织都必须严格遵守集体领导和个人负责相结合的原则，任何党员和党的组织都必须受到党的自上而下的和自下而上的监督。
    党的民主原则不能离开党的集中原则。党是以一切党员都要遵守的纪律联结起来的统一的战斗组织；没有纪律，党决不能领导国家和人民战胜强大的敌人而实现社会主义和共产主义。党是阶级的最高组织，它必须努力在国家生活的各个方面发挥它的正确的领导作用和核心作用，反对任何降低党的作用和削弱党的统一的分散主义倾向。党的团结和统一，是党的生命，是党的力量的所在。经常注意维护党的团结，巩固党的统一，是每一个党员的神圣职责。在党内不容许有违反党的政治路线和组织原则的行为，不容许有分裂党、进行小组织活动、向党闹独立性、把个人放在党的集体之上的行为。
    任何政党和任何个人在自己的活动中都不会是没有缺点和错误的。中国共产党和它的党员必须经常用批评和自我批评的方法揭露和消除自己的缺点和错误，以教育自己和人民。鉴于党在国家和社会生活中的领导地位，党更加需要向党的一切组织和党员提出严格的要求，更加需要展开批评和自我批评，特别是鼓励和支持党内的自下而上的批评和人民群众对党的批评，禁止压制批评的行为。党必须防止和抵制资产阶级的、小资产阶级的思想作风的侵蚀，防止和克服党内任何右的和“左”的机会主义倾向。对于犯了错误的党员，只要所犯的错误可以在党内改正，并且本人愿意改正，党就应当采取治病救人的方针，把他们留在党内加以教育，帮助他们改正错误；而对于那种坚持不改正错误并且进行危害党的活动的分子，就必须进行坚决的斗争，直至开除他们出党。
    中国共产党要求每一个党员把党的利益放在个人利益之上，勤勤恳恳，老老实实，努力学习，艰苦奋斗，团结广大群众，战胜一切困难，以求把中国建设成为一个伟大的、富强的、先进的社会主义国家，并且在这个基础上继续前进，实现人类的最高理想——共产主义。
