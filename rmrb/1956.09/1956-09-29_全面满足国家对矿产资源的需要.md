Speech by Comrade He Changgong, Vice Minister of Geology

Now I will offer some opinions on geological work.

    The First Five-Year Plan Can Be Completed Ahead of Schedule and Exceeded

The progress and achievements of geological work are related to the rational distribution of our country's productive forces and the speed and scale of industrial construction. The weak foundation of geological work and the unclear resource situation in our country used to be one of the main difficulties in construction. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Party and the state have attached great importance to geological work, incorporating it into the national plan from the very beginning of the First Five-Year Plan and adopting a policy of great development, which has given geological work a new look. In the past few years, the number of employees engaged in geological exploration has grown from over 10,000 to 170,000, of which the number of geological personnel with a college degree has increased from over 200 to over 6,000; the number of drilling rigs in operation has increased from over 300 to over 3,000; the technical equipment of geological exploration teams has been continuously enriched and improved; and the level of geological science and technology has also been improved.

The First Five-Year Plan for geological work is expected to be completed ahead of schedule and exceeded. The state requires the geological department to explore and determine the reserves of more than a dozen minerals during the First Five-Year Plan period, but in fact, it has already explored and determined the reserves of 3.1 billion tons of iron ore, 21 billion tons of coal, and more than 30 other metal and non-metal minerals. It has basically guaranteed the needs of coal, ferrous metallurgy, and non-ferrous metallurgy industries. There have also been huge new discoveries of oil resources. After several years of work, it has been further proved that our country has abundant mineral resources, which are sufficient to guarantee the needs of our country's socialist industrialization.

    Our Shortcomings in Work

However, at present, the development of geological work in our country is not comprehensive or balanced enough, and the use of forces is not entirely rational; the types of minerals that have been explored and determined are not enough, and the comprehensive research on minerals is not sufficient; insufficient attention has been paid to the supervision of mine exploitation and the protection of mineral resources. These shortcomings are, of course, due to our lack of experience, but the main reason is the one-sidedness in our thinking and the bureaucracy in our leadership style.

In the exploration of mineral resources, we have paid attention to the needs of various new industrial bases in the inland, but not enough attention to the needs of industries in coastal areas; we have paid attention to meeting the needs of large-scale state-owned enterprises, but not enough attention to the needs of local enterprises; we have paid attention to the needs of the state for several major minerals (such as iron, coal, copper, lead, zinc, etc.), but have not taken more active and effective measures to solve the urgent needs of the state for minerals such as nickel and chromium. Very little work has been done on rare metals, precious metals, and dispersed elements. We have done a lot of work in industrial areas and industrial cities on water use and large-scale hydro-engineering geology, but very little hydrological geological work has been done in agricultural reclamation areas and pastoral areas. Therefore, to fully meet the mineral raw material and geological exploration work needed for national construction, greater efforts must be made.

In order to free our country's geological work from its backward and passive state and enable it to adapt to the overall requirements of socialist construction, it is necessary to closely combine extensive general surveys with focused exploration, in accordance with the principle of ensuring key points and overall consideration, and to carry out overall planning and overall development. We believe that during the Second Five-Year Plan period, we should still use the main force to continue to work hard to establish and expand the mineral raw material bases for ferrous metals (special attention should be paid to rich iron ore), non-ferrous metals, coking coal, and power coal in the Northwest, Southwest, North China, Inner Mongolia, and Xinjiang industrial areas. Strengthen geological work in Tibet to prepare resource conditions for the development of industry in the Tibetan region. At the same time, we should pay attention to solving the needs of industry in the Northeast region and coastal areas. Accelerate the general survey and exploration of petroleum and minerals urgently needed by the state (such as nickel and chromium). Strengthen the exploration of radioactive elements and actively provide the origin of rare metals and precious metals. Pay attention to the comprehensive research of dispersed elements in minerals. While ensuring the key construction of the state, we must also pay attention to the iron ore, coal mines, and apatite needed by local industry and agriculture. Conduct regional hydrogeological work around new industrial areas and agricultural reclamation areas, and ensure engineering geological data for important hydraulic hubs.

    Three Problems That Should Be Solved in the Future

In order to complete the above tasks, meet the mineral resource needs of the Second Five-Year Industrial Production level, and prepare for the Third Five-Year Plan, I think it is necessary to solve the following three problems:

First, while continuing to focus on mineral exploration, we must greatly strengthen regional geological surveying, mineral prospecting, and scientific research, further study the genesis and distribution laws of minerals, pave the way for exploration, and maintain the continuous growth of various mineral reserves. In the past few years, because new construction projects required design reserves urgently, and at that time there was previous survey data that could be used, it was correct for us to concentrate our efforts on key exploration, and as a result, the exploration force has also greatly developed. However, it is a major defect that we have not strengthened other links in accordance with necessity and possibility and in accordance with exploration. As a result, there is a lack of backup production sites, and the explored deposits have not been seriously researched and summarized, so as to draw scientific conclusions to guide future work; at the same time, due to the neglect of stratigraphic paleontology and the analysis and identification of rocks and minerals, the smooth progress of prospecting and regional geological surveying has been seriously affected, which has affected the comprehensive utilization of various mineral useful components. During the Second Five-Year Plan period, exploration work should still focus on the key points and quickly explore and determine the mineral reserves urgently needed by the state. At the same time, in response to the needs of various industrial areas, we should extensively carry out regional geological surveying and prospecting, increase the proportion of this work, and equip it with a stronger technical force and adopt new technical methods. When doing this work, we should pay full attention to the comprehensive survey of various deposits in an area and the comprehensive research of multiple useful minerals in a deposit. Closely integrate with production, organize scientific research teams, and carry out research work in a planned and focused manner according to the current production needs and taking care of the shortcomings. At present, we should focus on the study of deposits, stratigraphic paleontology, and rocks and minerals. We should pay enough attention to the theory and methods of geophysical and geochemical prospecting, and carry out research on new exploration technologies and methods. When carrying out research work, on the one hand, we should constantly summarize our own experiences, and at the same time, vigorously learn and absorb the new achievements of science and technology in the Soviet Union and other countries to guide a large number of production activities. Prevent the tendency to deviate from reality and the tendency not to pay attention to improving basic theory.

Second, we should strengthen exploitation exploration and mine geological work to guide and supervise the exploitation and utilization of mineral raw materials. In the past few years, because the design requirements of new factories and mines were very urgent, we focused on the exploration of design reserves for new factories, and did not pay due attention to exploitation exploration and mine geology. In the future, with the successive completion of new factories and mines, this requires us to carry out exploitation exploration without delay. It should be pointed out that relying only on the design reserves for factory construction is not enough to correctly arrange exploitation. To exploit, we must gradually explore the design reserves into high-level reserves, and further clarify the stratum and structure, so as to adapt to modern large-scale production. The workload of this work is greater than the exploration of design reserves. In some mines that have already been in production, the guaranteed years of mineral resources are already very short, which requires us to quickly carry out the work of "exploring the edges and touching the bottom" and "finding mines in mines" to extend the life of the mines as much as possible. For example, Shuikoushan in Hunan has found new ore bodies in the mining area, which is a very good example. Some mines have not carried out or have carried out very little mine geological work, resulting in blind exploitation, greed for rich ore, not eating poor ore, and the loss of symbiotic useful minerals and other phenomena of resource waste are very serious, which should arouse our high attention. Whether new or old mines, analytical research on rare or dispersed elements should be carried out to provide geological data for comprehensive utilization. In short, now that we have been able to guarantee the amount of minerals needed for enterprise construction, we should transfer our strength to this area.

Third, we should give play to the enthusiasm of all parties under the principle of unified planning and strengthened leadership. Use the method of old departments supporting new departments and the central government supporting local governments to establish and gradually enrich the geological institutions of relevant ministries and provinces. Clearly stipulate the basic tasks and development direction of various geological departments. Actively train cadres and scientific and technical talents, and rationally allocate forces. Establish necessary management systems (including geological exploration registration, reserve review, unified production quotas, mine protection and supervision, etc.). According to our country's resource conditions and technical conditions, reasonably stipulate the utilization standards of ore. From the basic tasks and development direction of various departments, I think the Ministry of Geology should gradually take on the national regional survey, prospecting, and mining area exploration work, and be responsible for the technical guidance of national geological work. The geological institutions of various industrial departments should gradually shift the focus of their work to exploitation exploration, mine geology, and exploration around mining areas. The geological scientific research work of various ministries should be appropriately divided and closely cooperated with the Academy of Sciences. In this way, we can overcome the situation of unclear tasks, unclear division of labor, duplication and waste of some work, and weakness of some links, so that geological work can be developed and improved comprehensively and balancedly.

The Eighth National Congress of the Party is an event of great historical significance in the political life of the people of the whole country. The congress has given the geological department a very glorious task. The Communist Party members of the geological department must unite all employees and, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and local party committees, work diligently, be neither arrogant nor impetuous, and constantly reveal the secrets of the underground resources of the motherland, and fully meet the needs of our country's socialist construction for mineral resources.

    全面满足国家对矿产资源的需要
    地质部副部长　何长工同志的发言
    现在我就地质工作发表一些意见。
    第一个五年计划可以提前和超额完成
    地质工作的进展和成就，关系着我国生产力的合理分布以及工业建设的速度和规模。我国地质工作的基础薄弱和资源情况不明，曾是建设中的主要困难之一。建国以来，党和国家对地质工作极为重视，从第一个五年计划开始，就把它纳入了国家计划，并采取了大发展的方针，使地质工作出现了一个新的面貌。几年来，从事地质勘察事业的职工，从万余人发展到十七万人，其中具有高等学校毕业程度的地质人员，从二百余人发展到六千余人；开动的钻机从三百余部增加到三千余部；地质勘探队伍的技术装备，不断地得到充实与改善；地质科学技术水平，也有所提高。
    地质工作的第一个五年计划，预计可以提前和超额完成。国家要求地质部门在第一个五年计划期间，探明十几种矿产储量，而实际已经探明了铁矿三十一亿吨，煤二百一十亿吨，还有其他金属和非金属等三十几种矿产储量。基本上保证了煤炭、黑色冶金、有色冶金等工业建设的需要。石油资源也有了巨大的新发现。经过几年来的工作，进一步证明了我国拥有丰富的矿产资源，足以保证我国社会主义工业化的需要。
    我们工作中的缺点
    可是，目前我国地质工作发展还不全面、不平衡，力量使用不尽合理；探明的矿种还不够多，对矿产的综合研究不够；没有注意矿山开采的监督和矿产资源的保护。这些缺陷，固然由于我们经验不足，但主要的还是由于我们思想上的片面性和领导作风上的官僚主义所造成的。
    在矿产资源的勘察方面，我们注意了内地各个新的工业基地的需要，但对近海地区工业的需要注意不够；注意了满足国家大型企业的需要，但对地方企业的需要照顾不够；注意了国家对若干主要的矿种（如铁、煤、铜、铅、锌等）的需要，但对国家急需的矿产如镍、铬等，没有采取更积极有效的措施，加以解决。对稀有金属、贵重金属和分散元素所作的工作还很少，在工业区和工业城市用水及大型水力工程地质方面，作了不少的工作，但对农垦区、牧畜区的水文地质工作，则作得很少。因而全面满足国家建设所需要的矿物原料和地质勘察工作，还必须作更大的努力。
    为了使我国地质工作摆脱落后与被动的状态，能够适应社会主义建设的全面要求，必须按照确保重点与统筹兼顾的原则，把广泛的普查和有重点的进行勘探密切的结合起来，进行全面规划，全面发展。我们认为，在第二个五年计划期间，仍然应该以主要力量，继续为建立和扩大西北、西南、华北、内蒙、新疆等工业区的黑色金属
  （应特别注意富铁矿）、有色金属、炼焦煤和动力用煤等矿物原料基地而努力。加强西藏地质工作，为发展西藏地区的工业准备资源条件。同时应该注意解决东北地区和近海地区工业的需要。加速进行石油及国家急需的矿产（如镍、铬）的普查和勘探。加强放射性元素的勘察工作，并积极提供稀有金属、贵重金属的产地。注意对矿产中分散元素的综合研究。在保证国家重点建设的同时，还必须注意照顾地方工业和农业所需要的铁矿、煤矿和磷灰石。围绕新的工业区和农垦区，进行区域水文地质工作，并保证重要的水力枢纽的工程地质资料。
    今后应当解决三个问题
    为了完成上述任务，满足第二个五年工业生产水平所需要的矿产资源，并为第三个五年计划作准备，我认为须要解决以下三个问题：
    第一，在继续抓紧矿产勘探的同时，必须大大加强区域地质测量、矿产普查和科学研究，进一步研究矿产的生成和分布规律，为勘探开辟道路，以保持各种矿产储量的持续增长。几年来由于新的建设项目要求设计储量极为迫切，而当时又有前人的调查资料可以利用，所以我们集中力量进行重点勘探是正确的，因而勘探力量也有了较大的发展。可是我们没有依据必要和可能与勘探相适应地加强其他各个环节，则是很大的缺陷。因而后备产地缺乏，所勘探的矿床，没有进行认真的研究总结，从而得出科学的结论以指导今后工作；同时由于忽视地层古生物及岩石、矿物的分析鉴定工作，严重地影响了普查和区域地质测量的顺利进行，影响了各种矿产有用成分的综合利用的研究。在第二个五年计划期间，勘探工作，仍应抓住重点，迅速探明国家急需的矿产储量。同时针对各个工业区的需要，广泛地展开区域地质测量和普查，应该提高这项工作量的比重，并配备较强的技术力量，采用新的技术方法。在作此项工作时，应充分注意在一地区各种矿床的综合调查，和一个矿床多种有用矿物的综合研究。密切结合生产，组织科学研究的队伍，针对目前的生产急需和照顾缺门有计划有重点地进行研究工作。目前应着重对矿床，地层古生物，及岩石、矿物的研究，对地球物理及地球化学探矿的理论和方法，应该足够重视，并进行新的勘探技术和方法的研究。在进行研究工作时，一方面应当不断地总结我们自己的经验，同时大力学习和吸收苏联及各国的科学技术的新成就，以指导大量的生产活动。防止脱离实际的倾向和不注意提高基本理论的倾向。
    第二，应当加强开采勘探和矿山地质工作，指导和监督矿物原料的开采和利用。几年来，因为新建厂矿的设计要求很迫切，我们集中注意了新厂设计储量的勘探，而对开采勘探和矿山地质未予以应有的注意。今后随着新建厂矿的陆续建成，这就要求我们不失时机的进行开采勘探。应该指出，只靠建厂设计的储量，还是不能够正确的布置开采的。要开采，必须陆续地把设计储量勘探为高级储量，并进一步把地层、构造弄清楚，才能适应近代化的大规模的生产。这项工作的工作量，比设计储量的勘探还要大。有些已经生产的矿山，矿产资源的保证年限已经很短了，这就要求我们迅速的进行“探边摸底”，“就矿找矿”的工作，尽量延长矿山的寿命。比如湖南水口山又在矿区找到了新的矿体，就是很好的范例。有些矿山，未进行或者很少进行矿山地质工作，所造成的盲目开采，贪吃富矿，不吃贫矿，丢失共生的有用矿物等等浪费资源的现象非常严重，应引起我们高度的注意。不论新的和老的矿山，都应该进行稀有或分散元素的分析研究，提供综合利用的地质资料。总之，现在凡是已经能够保证企业建设需要的矿量，则应转移力量到这方面来。
    第三，应该在统一规划、加强领导的原则下，发挥各方面的积极性。用老部支援新部、中央支援地方的办法，建立和逐步充实有关各部和各省的地质机构。明确规定各个地质部门的基本任务和发展方向。积极培养干部和科学技术人才，合理地分配力量。建立必要的管理制度（包括地质勘察登记、储量审查、统一生产定额、矿山保护和监察等等）。根据我国的资源条件和技术条件，合理地规定矿石利用标准。从各部门的基本任务和发展方向来说，我认为地质部应该逐步地把全国的区域测量、普查和矿区勘探工作担当起来，并负责全国地质工作的技术指导。各工业部门的地质机构，应逐步把工作重心转向开采勘探、矿山地质和矿区外围勘探方面来。地质科学研究工作，各部应与科学院适当分工，密切合作。这样，才能够克服任务不明、分工不清、某些工作重复、浪费和某些环节薄弱的状况，才能使地质工作得到全面地均衡地发展和提高。
    党的全国第八次代表大会，是全国人民政治生活中有伟大历史意义的事件。大会交给了地质部门以非常光荣的任务。地质部门的共产党员，一定要团结全体职工，在党中央及地方党委的领导下，兢兢业业，不骄不躁，不断地揭露祖国地下资源的秘密，充分地满足我国社会主义建设对矿产资源的需要。
