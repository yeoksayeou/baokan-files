The Story of Three Horses

    According to the Sino-Mongolian Friendly Trade Agreement, Comrade Sandaga, a herdsman from the South Gobi Province of the Mongolian People's Republic, handed over three of his good horses to our country last year. However, after these three Mongolian horses arrived in China, they missed their homeland and their former owner, and soon ran back. Over the past few months, Comrade Sandaga paid special attention to the care and education of these three horses. When our horse inspection delegation arrived in the South Gobi Province of Mongolia this year, he handed over these three well-fed horses to our delegation free of charge. (Liu Changshan)

A Lucky Piglet

    In late May this year, the Yalu River flooded, and Sidaogou Township in Linjiang County, Jilin Province, on the left bank of the Yalu River, was hit by a flood. A piglet in this township was washed away by the flood and drifted to the other side of the Yalu River, where it was rescued by the people of Zhongjiang County in Ciang Province, Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The Korean people originally intended to return the piglet immediately, but due to international procedures, they waited for more than a month. During this period, the lucky piglet was well-fed by the Korean people, and its weight increased from more than ten catties to more than forty catties. On July 29, the Korean side specially sent nine people, including two lieutenant-level officers, staff members of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and farmers, to cross the Yalu River by boat and return the piglet to its original owner in Sidaogou Township, China. The brotherly friendship of the Korean people deeply moved the residents of Sidaogou Township.

    三匹马的故事
    根据中蒙友好贸易协定，蒙古人民共和国南戈壁省牧民桑达嘎同志去年将自己养的三匹好马交给我国。但是，这三匹蒙古马到了中国之后，由于思恋乡土和从前的主人，不久又跑回去了。几个月来，桑达嘎同志对这三匹马特别注意地进行了护养和教育，等到今年我国赴蒙验马代表队到达蒙古南戈壁省时，他就把这三匹养的膘满肉肥的马无偿地交给了我国代表。　（刘长山）
    一头幸运的小猪
    今年五月下旬，鸭绿江洪水上涨，位于鸭绿江左岸的我国吉林省临江县四道沟乡遭到水灾。这个乡有一头小猪被水冲走，漂到鸭绿江彼岸，当即被朝鲜民主主义人民共和国兹江道中江郡的人民救起来。朝鲜人民本想即将小猪送还，但由于办理国际手续，等待了一个多月，在这个期间，这头幸运的小猪受到朝鲜人民的丰厚饲养，体重由原来的十多斤增加到四十多斤。7月29日，朝鲜方面特别派了两名中尉级军官、内务省工作人员以及农民等共九人乘着小船渡过鸭绿江，将这头小猪送还给我国四道沟乡的原主。朝鲜人民的兄弟友情深深地感动了四道沟乡的居民。
