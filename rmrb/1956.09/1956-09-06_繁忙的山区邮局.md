Xinhua News Agency, Guilin, 4th. The post office in the Yao Autonomous County of Dayao Mountain in Guangxi receives an average of more than 180 letters daily from all over the country. The envelopes are stamped with postmarks from Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan, Guangzhou, and Nanning and Guilin within Guangxi Province. From morning till dusk, this small post office is constantly busy.

In the long past, the Yao people of Dayao Mountain had not left the mountains for years. Now it's completely different. The letters that Yao farmers' children, Liu Baoyuan and Pang Youzhou, sent home were from the Central Institute for Nationalities in Beijing and the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League School. This post office also delivers dozens of book parcels and more than one hundred kinds of magazines to the local Xinhua Bookstore, cultural center, and readers every day; and delivers more than 800 newspapers to forestry and agricultural production cooperatives and various government agencies and schools.

When this post office was first established at the end of 1952, the most letters received from other places each day were only about ten. In recent years, the number of students from Dayao Mountain studying in schools inside and outside the province has greatly increased; in the spring of this year, 99% of the county's farmers formed eighty-eight advanced forestry and agricultural production cooperatives, and every cooperative established people's schools and literacy classes. The number of people who can write letters is slowly increasing. Many forestry and agricultural production cooperatives in different locations exchange letters with each other.

    繁忙的山区邮局
    新华社桂林4日电　在广西的大瑶山瑶族自治县的邮局里，每天收到从全国各地寄来的信件平均有一百八十多封。信封上盖着北京、上海、武汉、广州和广西省内南宁、桂林等地的邮戳。从早晨到黄昏，这个小小邮局一直不停地忙碌着。
    大瑶山瑶族人民在过去漫长的年代里，几年没有人出过山区。现在完全不同了。瑶族农民的孩子们——刘宝元和庞有周寄给家里的信件，便是从北京中央民族学院和青年团中央团校发出的。这个邮局每天还为当地新华书店、文化馆及读者递送几十件书籍包裹和一百多种杂志；为林业、农业生产合作社和各机关学校递送八百多份报纸。
    在1952年底这个邮局刚设立的时候，每天从外地寄来的信件最多不过十来封。近年来从大瑶山到省内外学校学习的学生大大增多；今年春季全县99％的农户组成了八十八个高级林业、农业生产合作社，社社都成立了民校和识字班。会写信的人慢慢多了。许多不同地点的林业和农业生产合作社，互相交换着信件。
