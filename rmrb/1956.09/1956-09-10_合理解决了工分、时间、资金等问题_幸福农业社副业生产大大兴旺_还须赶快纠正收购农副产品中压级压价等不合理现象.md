    (Reported by this newspaper) The Happy Agricultural Production Cooperative in Liying Township, Dengchuan County, Yunnan Province, consists of 544 households and 4,434 mu of land. Since transforming into an advanced cooperative this spring, this agricultural cooperative has fully leveraged the potential of organization, achieving bumper harvests in agriculture, collective sideline production, and household sideline production this year. According to a recent survey of two production teams within the cooperative, 93.7% of the 80 households surveyed are likely to increase their income, with the smallest increase being 15 yuan, the largest being 400 yuan, and the average increase being 100 to 200 yuan. Among the five households whose income will not increase this year, the largest decrease is 25 yuan, and the smallest decrease is only 3 yuan.

    This year, the Happy Agricultural Cooperative has carried out a series of basic construction and technological reforms in agricultural production. The entire township has been free from drought and flood disasters this year, and the average rice yield per mu is expected to reach 700 jin, an increase of 51.5% compared to last year. The total agricultural income is more than 160,000 yuan, an increase of 50% compared to 1955.

    The sideline production of the Happy Agricultural Cooperative has also developed this year. The Happy Cooperative paid attention to collective sideline production relatively early, with a deputy director specializing in leading sideline production and allocating 130 laborers (about 10% of the cooperative's labor force) to engage in sideline production according to their expertise. The work points for sideline production are also slightly higher than those for agriculture, ranging from 7 to 11 points per labor day for agriculture and 8 to 12 points for sideline production. Therefore, to date, the Happy Cooperative has operated ten types of sideline businesses: pig breeding, fishing, making tofu, vermicelli, rushan (a Yunnan specialty), and operating transportation and shipping. Preliminary calculations indicate that the collective sideline income of the cooperative can reach more than 44,000 yuan, which is about one-quarter of the total agricultural output value.

    Among the farmers' sideline income, the most important is household sideline production. In 1955, the household sideline income of farmers in Liying Township accounted for about 50% of agricultural income. The Happy Cooperative did not pay enough attention to household sideline production this spring, mainly because they were afraid that engaging in household sideline production would hinder collective sideline production. As a result, around April, the cooperative members clamored that they had no pocket money to spend. They either pestered the cooperative cadres to borrow money all day long or simply disobeyed the cooperative's labor plans and engaged in some sporadic sideline production themselves. The facts educated the cooperative cadres, prompting them to quickly strengthen their leadership over household sideline production.

    The key to developing household sideline production is to allocate a certain amount of production time to the cooperative members. In the past, agricultural work was arranged too tightly, and there were too many meetings, which occupied and wasted a lot of time that could be used for household sideline production. Based on these circumstances, the Happy Cooperative rearranged the production time, leaving five to six days per month for cooperative members to engage in household sideline production. At the same time, they changed the method of assigning agricultural work and evaluating work points (changing to arranging agricultural work in small sections, and issuing work tickets in the fields every day after finishing the work), which greatly saved the time for evening meetings, allowing cooperative members to do some sideline work in the evenings and mornings.

    With time, it is also necessary to provide cooperative members with specific assistance. In this regard, the Happy Cooperative has adopted the following methods: First, 15,000 yuan was allocated from the collective sideline income and the pre-purchase funds for the spring harvest to cooperative members with cash difficulties as sideline production funds; second, sows were added to the collective sideline breeding program to prepare for breeding piglets next spring and distributing them to each cooperative member for free rearing; third, cooperative members with hens were mobilized to help households without chickens hatch chicks.

    The household sideline production of the Happy Cooperative has quickly become active. By July of this year, cooperative members had raised 746 pigs individually, 39 more than last year; 1,680 chickens, an increase of more than 800 compared to last year. 196 households were weaving straw mats, 121 households were making straw sandals, 75 households were twisting hemp ropes, and 60 households were spinning hemp threads... According to surveys over the past few months, each cooperative member can earn an average of 5 to 15 yuan per month from household sideline production, which means that more than 90% of the cooperative members no longer lack pocket money.

    The household sideline income of the Happy Cooperative this year is estimated to reach more than 65,000 yuan, plus the collective sideline income, totaling about 110,000 yuan, accounting for about 40% of the total agricultural and sideline output value; however, the potential of sideline production has not yet been fully exploited. The cooperative plans to further develop pig and chicken raising next year, and plans to allocate a portion of the land for cooperative members to use. In order to further develop rural sideline production, it is also necessary to obtain the cooperation of commercial and supply and marketing departments. What urgently needs to be resolved at present is the problem of suppressing grades and prices in the purchase of agricultural and sideline products, and the problem of excessively low labor fees and excessively high quotas in processing orders.

### 合理解决了工分、时间、资金等问题  幸福农业社副业生产大大兴旺  还须赶快纠正收购农副产品中压级压价等不合理现象

    合理解决了工分、时间、资金等问题
    幸福农业社副业生产大大兴旺
    还须赶快纠正收购农副产品中压级压价等不合理现象
    本报讯　云南省邓川县李营乡的幸福农业生产合作社，共五百四十四户，四千四百三十四亩田地。这个农业社从今年春天转为高级社以后，充分发挥了组织起来的潜力，今年农业、集体副业和家庭副业都获得丰收。根据最近在这个社的两个生产队中的调查，八十户社员中，有93.7％都可能增加收入，其中最少的增加十五元，最多的增加四百元，一般的增加一至二百元。今年不能增加收入的五户中，最多的减收二十五元，最少的只减三元。
    幸福农业社今年在农业生产方面进行了一系列的基本建设和技术改革，全乡今年都无旱涝灾害，水稻产量平均每亩可达七百斤，比去年增产51.5％。农业总收入共十六万多元，比1955年增加50％。
    幸福农业社的副业生产，今年也有发展。幸福社对集体副业注意得比较早，有一个副社长专职领导副业生产，并抽调了一百三十个劳动力（约为全社劳动力的10％）按专长分工搞副业。副业的劳动分也比农业稍高，农业每个劳动日由七分到十一分，副业为八分到十二分。因此，到目前为止，幸福社已经营了十种副业：养猪、捕鱼、做豆腐、粉丝、乳扇（云南的一种特产），经营驮运和船运等。初步计算，该社集体副业收入共可达四万四千多元，约等于农业总产值的四分之一。
    农民的副业收入中，最主要的还是家庭副业。1955年李营乡农民的家庭副业收入，约占农业收入的50％。幸福社在今年春天对家庭副业的注意是不够的，主要的顾虑是怕搞了家庭副业妨碍了集体副业。结果，在四月前后，社员们纷纷叫嚷没有零用钱花，他们不是成日里缠着社干部借钱，就是干脆不服从社里的劳动计划，自己搞些零星副业生产。事实教育了社干部，使他们迅速地加强了对家庭副业的领导。
    发展家庭副业的关键，是要给社员们留出一定的生产时间。过去，农活安排得太紧，会议又太多，占用了和浪费了很多可作家庭副业的时间。根据这些情况，幸福社重新安排了生产时间，每月留出五天到六天让社员进行家庭副业，同时改变了分派农活和评工记分的办法（改为按小段安排农活，每天干完活就在田里发工票），大大节约了晚上开会的时间，使社员能在晚间和早上做一些副业活。
    有了时间，还需要给社员具体帮助。在这一方面，幸福社采取了以下办法：一、从集体副业收入和大春预购款中，拨出一万五千元发给现金有困难的社员作副业生产资金；二、在集体副业中增养母猪，准备明春繁殖小猪，无偿地分给每户社员饲养；三、动员有母鸡的社员帮助无鸡户孵养小鸡。
    幸福社的家庭副业迅速地活跃起来了。到今年7月份，社员个人已养毛猪七百四十六头，比去年多三十九头；鸡一千六百八十只，比去年增加八百多只。有一百九十六户编草席，一百二十一户打草鞋，七十五户搓麻绳，六十户纺麻线……。根据过去几个月的调查，每户社员平均每月可从家庭副业生产中收入五元至十五元，也就是说，90％以上的社员，已经不缺零用钱花了。
    幸福社今年的家庭副业收入估计可能达到六万五千多元，加上集体副业收入，共约十一万元，占农副业总产值的40％左右；但是，副业生产的潜力仍未充分发挥。该社计划明年还要进一步发展养猪养鸡等项生产，并拟拨出一部分田地，分给社员使用。为了进一步发展农村副业，还须取得商业和供销部门的配合，目前急需解决的是农副产品收购工作中压级压价的问题，和加工订货中工缴过低、定额过高的问题。
