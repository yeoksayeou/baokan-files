    Shanghai's 3,800+ Joint Public-Private Factories
    Over 7,000 Private Sector Personnel Participate in Labor Competitions

    (Reported by this newspaper) According to statistics from the Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce, more than 7,000 private sector personnel from over 3,800 joint public-private factories in the city have participated in labor competitions. These participating private sector personnel generally contribute their production technology and management knowledge, and propose various initiatives. Zhou Bailing, a private sector engineer at the Shanghai Star Daily Chemical Industry Factory, suggested adopting a countercurrent washing method, which reduced the glycerin content of soap base from the original 0.5% to 0.2%, improving the oil yield of glycerin and reducing costs. Chen Xicheng, the head of the private sector production technology section of Shanghai Huafeng Enamel Factory, suggested using magnetic instruments to absorb iron filings from white powder, improving product quality. The positive performance of private sector personnel has been rewarded by leadership and welcomed by employees. More than 900 private sector personnel participating in the labor competition have received awards, and some have even received the honorary title of "Outstanding Worker."

    Participating in labor competitions has played a positive role in the personal transformation of private sector personnel. Those who were previously passive in management have become active, and those with poor labor-management relations have undergone changes. Qian Yongsen, the private sector head of Qian Yongji Electric Motor Factory, had a negative attitude towards management in the past due to poor enterprise production and tense labor-management relations. After the enterprise became a joint public-private venture, he participated in the labor competition and received awards. Through the competition, private sector personnel have learned a lot of socialist enterprise management knowledge and production technology, experienced the joy of labor, and become more optimistic about their personal future.

    Although the work of absorbing private sector personnel to participate in labor competitions in Shanghai's joint public-private factories has initially unfolded, the administrative and labor union organizations in many enterprises do not fully recognize the importance of this work, and some private sector personnel still have a less than active attitude. Relevant leading organs in Shanghai are further studying and strengthening leadership over this work.

    上海三千八百多户公私合营工厂
    七千多私方人员参加劳动竞赛
    本报讯　据上海市工商业联合会的统计，全市已有三千八百多户公私合营工厂的七千多位私方人员参加了劳动竞赛。这些参加竞赛的私方人员，一般都能贡献出自己的生产技术和经营管理知识，提出各种创议。上海日用化学工业明星厂私方工程师周百龄创议采用逆流洗涤法，使皂基甘油含量从原来的0.5％，降低到0.2％，提高了甘油出油率，降低了成本。上海华丰搪瓷厂私方生产技术科科长陈希诚，建议采用吸铁仪器吸收白粉中的铁屑，提高了产品质量。私方人员的这种积极表现受到了领导上的奖励和职工的欢迎。参加劳动竞赛的私方人员已有九百多人得了奖，有的还得到了优秀工作者光荣称号。
    参加劳动竞赛对私方人员的个人改造起了良好的作用，过去经营消极的变得积极起来，过去劳资关系不好的有了转变。钱镛记电机厂私方负责人钱镛森，过去因企业生产不好，劳资关系紧张，经营态度消极；企业公私合营后，他参加了劳动竞赛，得到了奖励。通过竞赛，私方人员学到了许多社会主义企业经营知识和生产技术，体会了劳动的愉快，对个人前途更加乐观了。
    上海公私合营工厂吸收私方人员参加劳动竞赛的工作虽已初步展开，但还有不少企业的行政和工会对这件工作的重要性认识不足，某些私方人员还存在着不够积极的态度。上海市有关领导机关正在进一步研究和加强对这一工作的领导。
