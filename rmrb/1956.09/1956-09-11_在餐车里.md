    In the Dining Car
    On August 18th, on the seventh special express train on the Beijing-Hankou Railway, passengers in the dining car were eating while watching the flooded corn, sorghum, and soybeans outside the train window... sighing.
    On the table in front of a luxuriously dressed female passenger were many bread crusts, like watermelon rinds left over by someone with incomplete teeth.
     “Judging by your proficiency in eating bread without the crust, this isn't your first time, is it?” a passenger asked. “Your judgment is quite right, I have never been accustomed to eating bread crusts,” she said fluently.
     “Why aren't you accustomed to eating bread crusts!” “Look at what you're asking!...” she said somewhat impatiently.
     “Do you know the history of bread's origins?” he asked with a somewhat accusatory tone.
     “How annoying!” she said nervously, and walked towards the dining car door. Tian Li

    在餐车里
    8月18日，在京汉路第七次特别快车上，乘客们在餐车里一面用饭，一面看着火车窗外被水淹了的玉米、高粱，大豆……叹息着。
    在一个穿着华丽的女乘客面前的桌上摆着许多面包皮，像牙齿不全的人吃剩的西瓜皮。
     “看您吃面包不吃皮的熟练程度，不是第一次吧？”一位乘客问。“您的判断很对，我是向来不习惯吃面包皮的。”她很流利地说。
     “您为什么不习惯吃面包皮！”“看你问的！……”她有些不耐烦了。
     “你可知道面包的出身历史吗？”他带些质问的口吻了。
     “真别扭！”她很紧张地说着，便向餐车门走去。　田李
