    Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, September 12th: The Director of the Egyptian Presidential Political Bureau, Sabri, accused Britain and France on September 11th of creating a very serious situation regarding the Suez Canal issue.
    Sabri said that the very serious situation mentioned in the communique of the meeting between the British Prime Minister and the French Prime Minister in London arose "because Britain and France, disregarding the fact that Egypt has announced that it will respect all its promises to all countries, are attempting to regain Egypt's Suez Canal and threatening to use force."
    Sabri said that the recommendations made by the Menzies Committee violated the United Nations Charter and international justice. He also said that when the Menzies Committee was asked which international agreements Egypt had abolished or violated, the committee could not answer.
    Sabri accused the former international Suez Canal Company's institutions in Paris of notifying non-Egyptian employees working in the Suez Canal to stop working this weekend as an attempt to obstruct canal navigation and create incidents. He pointed out that this was published after the meeting between the British and French heads of state, which showed that they "stipulated a policy aimed at obstructing the navigation of the canal."
    He said: "It is clear that the purpose of these two governments is clearly to create incidents that will enable them to intervene after refusing to consider Egypt's proposal to conclude any international agreement, in order to achieve the goal of depriving Egypt of its legitimate rights to the Suez Canal."
    Commenting on the British and French governments' expressed desire in the London communique to abide by the rule of law in international affairs, Sabri said: "Egypt believes that threatening to regain the Suez Canal, which is recognized as part of Egypt, is a violation of international justice and law."

    埃及总统府政治局长
    谴责英法企图阻挠运河通航
    新华社12日讯　开罗消息：埃及总统府政治局长萨布里9月11日指责英法正在就苏彝士运河问题制造非常严重的局势。
    萨布里说，伦敦英国首相和法国总理会谈的公报所提到的非常严重的局势之所以产生，是“由于英法不顾埃及已经宣布它将尊重它对所有国家所作的一切诺言的事实而企图重新取得埃及的苏彝士运河，并且威胁要使用武力”。
    萨布里说，孟席斯委员会提出的建议是违反联合国宪章和国际正义的。他还说，当向孟席斯委员会问到埃及废除过或者破坏过哪些国际协定的时候，委员会不能回答。
    萨布里指责在巴黎的前国际苏彝士运河公司的机构通知在苏彝士运河工作的非埃及籍雇员在本周末停止工作是企图阻挠运河通航和制造事件。他指出，这是在英法两国首脑会谈以后发表的，这显示出他们之间“规定了一种政策，这种政策的目的是企图阻挠运河的通航”。
    他说：“很明显，这两个政府的目的显然是要制造事件，这种事件将使得它们能够在拒绝考虑埃及提出的缔结任何国际协定的建议以后来进行干预，以便实现剥夺埃及对苏彝士运河的合法权利的目的”。
    萨布里在评论英法政府在伦敦公报中表示它们在国际事务中遵守法治的愿望时说：“埃及认为，威胁着要重新取得公认为埃及的一部分的苏彝士运河，这是违反国际正义和法律的”。
