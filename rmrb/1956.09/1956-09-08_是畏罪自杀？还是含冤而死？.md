Was it Suicide Out of Guilt? Or Death Under False Accusation?
Li Lijin

On April 1st, Liu San'nu, the storage committee member of the Liu Zhong Agricultural Cooperative, hanged himself. This news shocked everyone in Beizhou Township, Dutou District, Nanchang County. Some people said that Liu San'nu died under false accusation. Township and cooperative cadres said that Liu San'nu committed suicide out of guilt. Who is right?

Early in the morning of March 30th, Liu Xiaochang, the cooperative cadre stationed in the village, woke up and exclaimed in surprise that his fifteen yuan was missing. Qiu Yuansheng, the accountant of the township credit cooperative who lived in the same room, also discovered that his 23.8 yuan was gone. The two searched the bed, but couldn't find the money. Instead, they found a razor. Who was the thief? Only Liu San'nu in the whole village could shave, and he was the only one who had a razor. Therefore, they both affirmed that Liu San'nu had stolen the money. Qiu Yuansheng immediately reported the situation to Zhu Jinlai, the deputy district chief working in the township. Zhu Jinlai, based on the fact that a barber's razor is usually kept in the small pocket of his upper garment, speculated that the razor fell onto Liu Xiaochang's bed when Liu San'nu was stealing the money. He further concluded that Liu San'nu was the thief because Liu San'nu had committed theft before liberation. Based on his speculation, he interrogated Liu San'nu. Under Zhu Jinlai's influence, nine township and cooperative cadres, including Hu Shuixiang, the secretary of the CCP township branch, interrogated Liu San'nu on the morning of the 30th, even resorting to illegal coercion. Liu San'nu was forced to the point of being unable to endure it and had to say, "I didn't steal it, but I can compensate the money." Hu Shuixiang rebuked him for resisting stubbornly and ordered the cooperative cadres to tie him up. Liu Fusheng, the director of the agricultural cooperative, held a mass meeting to struggle against him and threatened, "If you don't confess, we will roll you up in a straw mat and smoke you." The meeting also decided: Liu San'nu must confess his crime of theft within four days, return all the stolen money, otherwise, he would be sent to the court to be sentenced to ten years in prison. They also forced Liu San'nu to put his fingerprints on the "crime of theft" one by one and deprived him of his right to work in the agricultural cooperative. The cadres involved thought they had won and settled this troublesome case. They waited for the good news of Liu San'nu confessing his crime and handing over the stolen money. However, the news that came was a tragedy: Liu San'nu hanged himself!

Was it suicide out of guilt? Or death under false accusation? While cadres and the masses were discussing, the county's joint inspection team came to investigate the incident. At that time, township and cooperative cadres still insisted that Liu San'nu committed suicide out of guilt, and secretly said, "Let's see how capable you are to come to a different conclusion!"

The comrades of the inspection team first started their investigation from Liu San'nu's activities. Liu San'nu was the storage committee member of the agricultural cooperative. On March 29th, the night when Liu Xiaochang and others lost money, Liu San'nu went to the cooperative committee meeting, went and returned with the other two cooperative committee members in the same room. The gate was locked after returning home, and he did not go out at night. How could his razor have ended up on Liu Xiaochang's bed? It turned out that Liu San'nu's razor was always placed on the huller (a tool for husking rice) at the gate all year round, and anyone could take it away when entering or exiting. In 1954, Liu Xiaochang's nine-year-old nephew took a razor to exchange it for sweet potatoes. Therefore, it is very likely that the thief deliberately took the razor and placed it on Liu Xiaochang's bed to frame him. In addition, when Qiu Yuansheng and Liu Xiaochang were making a fuss about finding the razor in the room, Liu San'nu was near their room. When he heard that it was his razor, he went in to claim it. If he had stolen the money, why didn't he run away? Logically, people would tell the truth to their loved ones. When Liu San'nu was struggled against and returned home, his lover said, "If you stole it, then admit it!" He replied, "I really didn't steal it. I won't lie in front of you, husband and wife. How could I do such a thing and face these two children?" These words were overheard by the director and deputy director of the agricultural cooperative when they eavesdropped at Liu San'nu's home. Looking at the scene, after investigation, the gate of Liu Xiaochang and Qiu Yuansheng's house was locked that night, and the door inside the room was also closed, and there were no holes dug in the wall, so who could have entered from outside the room to steal money? From the study of these situations, the inspection team confirmed that Liu San'nu's death was under false accusation, not out of guilt. So who was the thief? It was necessary to investigate the people who lived in the same room.

On the night of the money loss, three people lived in Qiu Yuansheng and Liu Xiaochang's room, another person being Liu Shuishun, the cultural and educational committee member of the cooperative. Obviously, the investigation should first focus on Liu Shuishun, who did not lose money. After repeated investigation and research, no suspicious elements were found on Liu Shuishun. Finally, the inspection team could only assume that the thief was the person who "lost" the money. Was it Qiu Yuansheng? He discovered the money loss after Liu Xiaochang and actively requested the cadres to handle the case. Was he trying to cover up his crime? However, after research, no factual basis for suspicion could be found. The comrades of the inspection team then researched Liu Xiaochang's situation. Liu Xiaochang was a poor peasant before liberation, and his life has improved greatly now. His work has always been relatively active, and his style is relatively upright. He was promoted from an ordinary farmer to a resident cadre of the cooperative. How could he steal money? Then, the inspection team analyzed Liu Xiaochang's economic situation. Liu Xiaochang said that he lost fifteen yuan, including eight yuan of loan issued to him by the government, four yuan of relief funds entrusted to him to forward, and three yuan given to him by his mother. After investigation, his mother did not give him a single cent. A flaw was also found in his expenses. After losing money, he borrowed nine yuan, and spent all this money on buying food and daily necessities, but he also lent two yuan to a cadre. Where did this money come from? Was it related to the money lost by Qiu Yuansheng? At this time, the inspection team also learned an important piece of information: On the evening of the day they lost money, Liu Xiaochang had gone to the courtyard of the deceased Liu San'nu. He went to Liu Yonghuang, who lived in the same courtyard as Liu San'nu, to pick up his galoshes. Was it related to stealing Liu San'nu's razor? Based on these circumstances, the inspection team naturally suspected Liu Xiaochang, so they educated Liu Xiaochang based on the existing materials. Finally, Liu Xiaochang confessed his theft: "I knew that Qiu Yuansheng had received his salary at the district office. I wanted to steal this money, but I was afraid of being found out, so I took the opportunity to steal Liu San'nu's razor when I went to Liu Yonghuang's house to pick up my galoshes. I knew that Liu San'nu had committed theft before liberation. I thought: If I faked the scene and shifted the suspicion of stealing money to Liu San'nu, everyone in the village would believe it. At about twelve o'clock that night, after I stole Qiu Yuansheng's money, I put the razor on the bed..."

People can't help but ask, why did Liu Xiaochang steal money?

It turned out that he had a beloved fiancée. When they got engaged, his fiancée asked him to buy a gold ring. If he didn't buy it, he couldn't bear to disappoint his fiancée. If he bought it, he didn't have the money, so he embarked on the path of crime and stole by framing others. Now, the criminal Liu Xiaochang has been sanctioned by the national law, and those township and cooperative cadres who committed serious subjectivist errors have also been punished. But what about the innocent Liu San'nu? He died under false accusation and cannot be resurrected. People often say that subjectivism kills people. Indeed, Liu San'nu's death is another clear proof.

    是畏罪自杀？还是含冤而死？
    李力今
    4月1日，刘众农业社的保管委员刘三奴悬梁自杀了，这个消息震动了南昌县渡头区北州乡所有的人们。有些群众说刘三奴是含冤而死。乡、社干部却说刘三奴是畏罪自杀。到底谁说的对呢？
    3月30日的一早，农业社的驻社干部刘小昌起床以后就惊讶地嚷他的十五元钱丢了。和他睡在一个房子里的乡信用合作社会计丘袁生也发觉自己的二十三元八角不见了。两个人在床上翻来找去，钱没有找到，却找到了一把剃头刀。贼是谁？全村只有刘三奴会剃头，也只有他一人有剃头刀。于是，他俩就一致肯定钱是刘三奴偷的。丘袁生随即把这些情况报告了正在该乡工作的副区长祝金来。祝金来根据理发师的刀通常都放在上衣的小口袋里，就推测出刀是刘三奴在偷钱时掉到刘小昌床上的；又根据刘三奴在解放前有过偷窃行为，就进一步肯定钱是刘三奴偷的。他根据自己的推测，对刘三奴进行了审讯。在祝金来的影响下，30日的上午就有九个乡、社的干部，包括中共乡支部书记胡水香等，审讯了刘三奴，甚至进行非法逼供。刘三奴被逼得无法忍受，只得说：“我没有偷，但钱我可以如数赔偿。”胡水香指斥他顽抗，并责令社的干部把他捆起来。农业社主任刘福生又召开群众大会斗争他，并威胁说：“如不承认，就用晒垫卷起来用烟熏。”会上还决定：限刘三奴四天内坦白偷窃罪行，退出全部赃款，否则，送法院判十年徒刑；又强迫刘三奴在“偷窃罪状”上逐条捺了手印，并剥夺了他在农业社劳动的权利。当事的干部们以为自己胜利了，了结了这桩恼人的案件，他们等待着刘三奴坦白罪行、交出窃款的好消息。可是，传来的却是噩耗：刘三奴悬梁自杀了！
    是畏罪自杀呢？是含冤而死呢？在干部和群众议论纷纷中，县的联合检查组来专门检查这个事件了。当时，乡、社干部还坚持认为刘三奴是畏罪自杀呢，并暗地说：“看你们有多大的本事，能得出另外的结论来！”
    检查组的同志首先从刘三奴的活动情况着手调查。刘三奴是农业社的保管委员，3月29日，也就是刘小昌等丢钱的那天晚上，刘三奴去开社务委员会，和同屋的另外两个社务委员同去同归，回家后大门上了锁，夜里也没有外出。他的剃头刀怎么会跑到刘小昌的床上去了呢？原来刘三奴的剃头刀一年到头都放在大门的砻上（破谷皮的工具），任何人出入时都可以顺手拿走。1954年，刘小昌的九岁侄儿就拿去一把剃头刀换了红薯吃。因此很有可能是偷钱的人有意把剃头刀拿走放在刘小昌等的床上嫁祸于人。另外，当丘袁生、刘小昌在房中闹着发现剃头刀的时候，刘三奴正在他们住的屋子附近，一听是他的剃头刀，就进去认领了。如果钱是他偷的，他为什么还不溜走。按理，人们对爱人是会说真心话的。当刘三奴被斗争回家以后，他爱人说：“如果偷了就承认了吧！”他回答说：“真的没有偷，夫妻面前，我不说假话，我干那样事，怎么对得起这两个孩子呢？”这些话，是农业社正、副主任到刘三奴家偷听到的。再从现场来看，经过调查，当晚刘小昌、丘袁生住房的大门是锁着的，房内门也关上了，墙壁又没有凿洞，谁又能从房外进去偷钱呢？从对这些情况的研究中，检查组肯定了刘三奴之死，是含冤而不是畏罪。那么偷钱的是谁呢？就不能不在同住在这个屋子里的人身上考查了。
    在丢钱的当天晚上，丘袁生、刘小昌的屋子里共住了三个人，另一人是社的文教委员刘水顺。显然，首先就该考查没有丢钱的刘水顺。经过反复调查研究，在刘水顺的身上，没有发现丝毫可以怀疑的地方。最后检查组只能去设想，偷钱的人就是“丢”钱的人了。是丘袁生吗？他发现丢钱在刘小昌之后，又积极要求干部处理，是不是为了掩饰自己的罪过呢？可是经过研究，找不到可以怀疑的任何事实根据。检查组的同志最后又研究了刘小昌的情况。刘小昌在解放前是个贫农，现在生活有很大的提高，他工作一贯比较积极，作风也较正派，由一个普通农民被提升为驻社干部。他怎么会去偷钱呢？接着检查组又分析了刘小昌的经济情况。刘小昌说丢了十五元钱，计政府发给他的贷款八元，委托他转发的救济款四元，他母亲给了他三元。经过调查，他的母亲没有给过他一角钱。从他的支出方面也发现了破绽。他丢钱后借了九元钱，用这笔钱买了粮食和日用品都花光了，可是他又借给一个干部两元钱，这钱是哪里来的呢？是不是与丘袁生丢了的钱有关呢？这时，检查组还了解到一个重要情况：就在他们两个丢钱的那天傍晚，刘小昌曾经去过死者刘三奴家的院子，他是去到与刘三奴同院住着的刘永隍家里去取套鞋的，是不是与窃刘三奴的剃头刀有关呢？检查组根据这些情况，就自然而然的怀疑到刘小昌的身上了，于是根据已有的材料对刘小昌进行了教育。最后，刘小昌坦白了自己的偷窃经过：“我知道丘袁生在区公所领了工资。我想偷这些钱，又怕被查出，于是趁去刘永隍家取套鞋的机会，偷窃了刘三奴的剃头刀。我知道刘三奴在解放前有过偷窃行为，我想：要是假作现场，把偷钱的嫌疑嫁到刘三奴的身上，全村的人一定都会相信的。在当天夜间十二时左右，我偷了丘袁生的钱后，就把剃头刀放在床上了。……”
    人们不禁要问，刘小昌为什么要偷钱呢？
    原来，他有一个心爱的未婚妻，在订婚的时候，未婚妻就要求他给买个金戒指，不买吧，不忍辜负未婚妻的希望，买吧，没有钱，于是就走上了犯罪的道路，用嫁祸于人的办法来偷。现在，罪犯刘小昌已经受到了国家法律的制裁，那些犯了严重的主观主义错误的乡、社干部也都分别受到了处分。可是无辜的刘三奴呢？含冤自尽不得复生了，人们常说主观主义害死人。的确，刘三奴之死又是一个明证。
