Support the Karamay and Qaidam Oilfields

    With the rapid development of China's industry, agriculture, and transportation, and the further strengthening of national defense, the need for petroleum is increasing. However, the petroleum industry in our country is relatively backward, and the resource situation is also unclear. Therefore, the discovery of the Karamay large oilfield in the Junggar Basin and the exploration of crude oil in the Lenghu and Mangnai areas of the Qaidam Basin are particularly exciting. However, to quickly determine the boundaries of the oilfields, further clarify the oil reserves, and discover more oilfields in order to develop them in a planned way, requires strong support from the whole country.
    The current situation is that in the Junggar Basin, only thirteen exploratory wells are testing oil in Karamay, and the proven oil-bearing area is only sixty square kilometers. According to experts' speculation, the Karamay oilfield area will exceed one hundred and seventy square kilometers, and the oil reserves will be over one hundred million tons. However, this speculation needs to be proven by drilling. From Karamay to Urho in the northeast, oil-bearing signs have also been discovered in an area of one hundred and thirty kilometers long and thirty kilometers wide. Accelerating drilling and clarifying the resource situation in such an oil seep area of three thousand nine hundred square kilometers will require several times more work than Karamay. In addition, the situation in the central part of the Junggar Basin is also being investigated. In the Qaidam Basin, although crude oil has been sprayed from shallow well drilling in the No. 4 structure in the Lenghu area (with an area of one hundred square kilometers) and the Youquanzi structure in the Mangnai area (with an area of four hundred square kilometers), both of these oilfields still need to continue deep well drilling in order to clarify the oil storage situation. Drilling work is also being expanded in other areas of Qaidam.
    To complete the above drilling tasks, the drilling teams face many difficulties in terms of engineering and living conditions. Overcoming these difficulties, relying solely on one or two ministries of the central government and the two provinces and regions of Qinghai and Xinjiang, is far from enough. Therefore, all relevant parties are required to provide necessary support.
    What difficulties exist in these two regions? How should they be supported?
    Because these two regions are located in remote and sparsely populated areas of the motherland, with inconvenient transportation, few roads, bad road surfaces, an insufficient number of vehicles, and no well-equipped automobile repair shops, the utilization rate of vehicles is not high. More and more employees are arriving, but many of the necessities for life and engineering cannot be delivered. In order to improve the transportation situation in Karamay and Qaidam, the State Council recently decided to build the trunk highway from Usu via Karamay and Urho to Kashi Turugart, the trunk highway from Dunhuang via Dangjin Pass to Mangnai, and the trunk highway from Chaka to Mangnai, and to set up stations for maintenance. The State Council also decided that the Ministry of Transport should allocate a batch of vehicles for use in these two regions. Before the railway line is built, the above-mentioned highways are the link to ensure that these two regions establish contact with industrial cities across the country. Therefore, Qinghai and Xinjiang provinces and regions, as well as the Ministry of Transport, are required to quickly formulate road construction plans, dispatch engineering and technical personnel, mobilize road construction machinery, and mobilize people of all ethnic groups to take rapid action. Such important highways should not only be built quickly, but also meet national standards. The Ministry of Transport should also cooperate with relevant units to send the vehicles supporting these two regions as soon as possible. After the roads are built, maintenance stations must also be set up along the routes to ensure the smooth completion of frequent transportation tasks.
    If the road problem is solved and there are vehicles, but there are no well-equipped automobile repair shops, the normal attendance rate of vehicles cannot be guaranteed. At present, a large number of vehicles in these two regions are being idled due to lack of repair. The State Council recently decided to transfer a group of employees from existing automobile repair shops across the country to form two repair shops, and equip them with a full set of repair equipment to support them. We hope that when the Ministry of Transport and the Ministry of Labor issue the assignment tasks to these enterprises, these enterprises should quickly send out personnel and equipment, and the personnel sent should be highly capable, and the equipment transferred should be good and usable.
    Establishing mechanical repair shops in Karamay and Qaidam is also a problem that urgently needs to be solved. Because a large number of machines are being transported there, and most of these machines are installed in the field, after being exposed to wind and sun, and sand and soil attacks, the machines inevitably have damaged parts that need to be repaired during frequent work. However, these two regions have never had a decent mechanical repair shop. In order to solve this problem, the State Council once decided that the Shanghai Municipal People's Committee should transfer employees from the factories of the Petroleum Machinery Company under the Municipal Heavy Industry Bureau to organize two mechanical repair shops to support them. We hope that what Shanghai sends is a complete set of factories, and that it will try its best to ensure that the factories can be put into production quickly after they are moved.
    Communication is also a major difficulty in the current work in Karamay and Qaidam. Because the oil areas are scattered, communication and liaison are now mainly carried out by automobiles or horses, which of course is difficult to meet the needs; in order to solve the difficulty of communication work, the State Council once decided to erect wired telephones along the highways in these two regions. It is required that the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications quickly dispatch line workers, and supply materials and equipment, and seize the time to erect wired telephones along the highways; at the same time, it is also necessary to help those drilling teams that work in the field all year round to gradually equip radio stations and portable radiotelephones.
    One of the biggest difficulties in the Qaidam area in winter is the lack of fuel. Without sufficient fuel, most of the staff would have to return to Xining, more than a thousand kilometers away, to spend the winter; this not only increases transportation costs, but more importantly, affects the normal progress of work. In order to overcome this difficulty, the State Council has put forward the task of developing the Yuka Coal Mine to the Qinghai Provincial People's Committee and the Ministry of Coal Industry. It is now autumn, and winter is coming in an instant. It is hoped that the Ministry of Coal Industry will provide early assistance to Qinghai Province in engineering and technology, and provide assistance to the province in the mechanical and power equipment such as water pumps and ventilation that it lacks, so that the coal mine can produce in large quantities before winter to ensure the supply of coal.
    Factory buildings and dormitories are also problems that must be solved in these two regions in engineering and life. The State Council has instructed the two provinces and regions of Qinghai and Xinjiang to accelerate the construction of factory buildings and dormitories. We hope that the People's Committees of the two places will organize forces to accelerate construction and strive to complete the original tasks ahead of schedule and in excess.
    The sufficient supply of staple and non-staple foods and daily necessities is a major event related to the lives of employees. At present, employees in some exploration areas have money but cannot buy what they need. It is hoped that the Ministry of Commerce will help Qinghai and Xinjiang provinces and regions to add stores to various exploration bases and expand the scope of supply. It is necessary to ensure not only the sufficient supply of staple and non-staple foods, but also the supply of daily necessities.
    More and more people are coming to work in Karamay and Qaidam, and the medical and health care problems of employees also need to be solved. To this end, the State Council has instructed the Ministry of Health to transfer a group of doctors and nurses to support these two regions. It is hoped that the Ministry of Health will quickly determine the candidates and make them quickly go to their work posts in these two regions.
    Recently, we have received letters from readers all over the country. They are very concerned about the construction of these two regions and hope to do something for these two regions. Some even asked to go to Karamay or Qaidam. This enthusiasm is of course welcome. However, supporting the Karamay and Qaidam oilfields is a long-term task. The current support is mainly to help petroleum exploration personnel find the oilfields and clarify the oil-bearing area and crude oil reserves in the above-mentioned aspects. As for the large-scale development of oilfields, that is a matter of the near future. When the situation is clarified and the oilfield development plan is formulated, the whole country will need to provide support on a larger scale.

    支援克拉玛依和柴达木油区
    随着我国工业、农业和交通运输业的迅速发展，国防事业的进一步加强，对石油的需要愈来愈多了。但是，石油工业在我国是比较落后的，而且资源情况也不清楚。因此，在准葛尔盆地发现克拉玛依大油田，在柴达木盆地的冷湖和茫崖地区探到了原油的消息，就特别令人兴奋。但是，要迅速查明油田的边界，进一步把石油储量摸清楚，发现更多的油田，以便有计划的开发，这就需要全国大力支援。
    目前的情况是：在准葛尔盆地上，只是克拉玛依有十三口探井试油，所查明的储油面积也不过六十平方公里。据专家们的推测，克拉玛依油田面积将超过一百七十平方公里，储油量将在一亿吨以上。但需要经过钻探来证明这种推测。从克拉玛依向东北到乌尔禾，在长一百三十公里、宽三十公里的地区内，也发现了储油迹象，在这样一个面积为三千九百平方公里的油苗区内，加速钻探，查明资源情况，它的工作量将要超过克拉玛依好几倍。此外，准葛尔盆地中部的情况也正在着手探查中。在柴达木盆地，目前虽然在冷湖区四号构造（面积为一百平方公里）和茫崖区的油泉子构造（面积为四百平方公里）上，经过浅井钻探喷出了原油；但是，这两个油田都还需要继续进行深井钻探，以便查明储油情况。在柴达木的其他地区，也正在扩展钻探工作。
    要完成上述钻探任务，钻探队的工程条件和生活条件都存在着不少的困难。要克服这些困难，如果仅仅依靠中央一两个部和青海、新疆两个省区的力量，是远远不够的。因此，就要求各个有关方面给予必要的支援。
    这两个地区存在着什么困难呢？需要怎样支援呢？
    由于这两个地区处在祖国边远偏僻的地点，人烟稀少，交通不便，公路少，路面坏，汽车数量不足，没有设备较全的汽车修理厂，汽车的利用率不高。职工愈来愈多，但生活及工程上所必需的许多东西，都送不进去。为了改善克拉玛依和柴达木地区的交通运输状况，国务院最近决定把从乌苏经克拉玛依、乌尔禾到喀什吐鲁盖的公路干线，把从敦煌经当金山口到茫崖的公路干线以及从茶卡到茫崖的公路干线修建起来，并设站养护。国务院还决定由交通部调拨一批汽车供这两个地区使用。在铁路线未修通以前，上述几条公路干线是保证这两个地区和全国工业城市建立联系的纽带。因此，要求青海、新疆两省区及交通部迅速订出修路的计划，抽调工程技术人员，调动筑路机械，动员各族人民迅速行动起来。像这样重要的公路干线，不仅要修的快，而且要修的符合国家标准。交通部还应该协同有关单位，把支援这两个地区的汽车尽快送去。公路修好以后，还必须把沿线的养护站设置起来，以保证频繁的运输任务能够顺利完成。
    如果公路问题解决了，并且有了汽车，但没有设备较好的汽车修理厂，还不能保证车辆的正常出勤率。目前这两个地区有大批的车辆因为缺乏修理而被闲置起来。国务院最近决定从各地现有汽车修理厂中抽调一批职工，配成两个修理厂，并配备全套修车设备支援他们。我们希望当交通部和劳动部把调派任务下达到哪些企业的时候，这些企业就应当迅速把人员和设备输送出来，而且派的人要个个精干，调的设备要件件好用。
    在克拉玛依和柴达木设立机械修理厂，也是急待解决的一个问题。由于大量机器源源运去，而这些机器大部分又是安装在野外的，经过风吹日晒，砂土袭击，机器在频繁的工作中不免有机件损坏需要修理的。但是这两个地区一直就没有个像样的机械修理厂。为了解决这个问题，国务院曾决定要上海市人民委员会从所属重工业局石油机械公司各厂中，抽调职工组织两个机械修理厂，支援他们。我们希望上海市送去的是成套的厂子，并尽可能争取做到厂子搬去以后，就能迅速投入生产。
    通讯联络也是现在克拉玛依和柴达木工作中的一大困难问题。由于油区分散，现在主要靠汽车或马匹来进行通讯联络，当然是很难满足需要的；为了解决通讯工作的困难，国务院曾决定在这两个地区沿公路干线架设有线电话。要求邮电部迅速调遣线路工人，并供应物资设备，抓紧时间把公路沿线的有线电话架设起来；同时还要帮助那些常年在野外工作的钻探队，逐步地把电台和轻便报话机配备起来。
    冬天在柴达木地区最大的困难之一是缺乏燃料。如果没有充足的燃料，大部分工作人员就得从柴达木回到一千公里以外的西宁来过冬；这样不仅增加了来往的运输费用，更重要的是影响了工作的正常进行。为了克服这个困难，国务院曾向青海省人民委员会及煤炭工业部提出了开发鱼卡煤矿的任务。目前已是秋季，转瞬间冬天就要来了，希望煤炭工业部及早在工程技术上帮助青海省，并对省里缺少的抽水、通风等机械动力设备给予援助，使煤矿在入冬以前就能大量生产，以保证煤炭的供应。
    厂房和宿舍也是这两个地区在工程及生活中必须解决的问题。国务院曾责成青海、新疆两省区加速建筑厂房和宿舍。我们希望两地的人民委员会组织力量，加速施工，争取提前并超额完成原定的任务。
    主副食品及日用百货的充分供应，这是关系到职工生活的大事。目前某些探区的职工，有钱却买不到必需的东西。希望商业部帮助青海、新疆两省区在各个勘探基地增设商店，扩大供应范围。不仅要保证主副食品的充分供应，而且要保证日用百货的供应。
    到克拉玛依和柴达木工作的人一天比一天多起来了，职工的医疗保健问题也需要解决。为此，国务院曾指示卫生部抽调一批医生和护士支援这两个地区。希望卫生部迅速确定人选，并使他们迅速到这两个地区的工作岗位上去。
    最近，我们曾接到来自全国各地的读者来信，他们对这两个地区的建设表示很关心，希望能为这两个地区做些事情，有的还要求到克拉玛依或柴达木去。这种热情当然是值得欢迎的。但是，支援克拉玛依和柴达木油区是一项长期的任务。目前的支援，主要是从上述各方面帮助石油勘探人员把油田找出来，把储油面积和原油储量探查明白。至于大规模开发油田那还是不久的将来的事情。等到情况查清楚了，开发油田的计划制定出来了，那时，就需要全国作更大规模的支援了。
