This year, Hunan had a bumper harvest of early rice, and now mid-season rice is also beginning to enter the market. After trial distribution calculations, many agricultural cooperatives have increased production. Normally, the peak season for rural markets should have arrived long ago, but the reality is quite the opposite. Many market towns are not as lively as before, and the trading hours for fairs have also been shortened compared to the past. In July, the total retail sales of the Hunan Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative system in rural markets actually decreased by 12.46% compared to June. According to a typical survey of three rural primary markets, retail sales in July decreased by 22.93% compared to June. This trend continued to develop in early August, and many places still have not shown significant improvement, and the procurement plans of the supply and marketing cooperative system and purchasing departments have not been completed well.

Why is such a situation occurring in the rural market in Hunan during this peak season, despite the bumper rice harvest? There are many reasons, but the most noteworthy is that cadres and farmers in many places have become singular in developing production, focusing only on rice yields of 1,000 catties per mu, and have not effectively carried out diversified operations.

Hunan is a grain-producing area, and it is correct to focus on rice production. However, Hunan has a large population and limited land, and farmers have always had the habit of diversified operations. Moreover, cash crops and sideline production account for a large proportion of the rural economy. In recent years, especially since last winter, some cadres and farmers have been intoxicated with the target of 1,000 catties of rice per mu, and have set the work points for sideline and dry-land crop labor days very low, thus abandoning diversified operations. In famous tea-producing areas such as Anhua and Xinhua counties, some agricultural cooperatives even prevented members from going out to pick tea, leaving the tea leaves to grow old on the trees, resulting in a reduction in spring tea production this year. In Xiangtan, Qianyang and other special districts, there were also phenomena of not allowing members to send manure to hemp fields for fertilization and transport timber from forest areas. In some areas of Youxian County that produce mat grass, the income from one mu of mat grass is more than that from two mu of rice. However, this spring, the cadres forcibly ordered farmers to pull out the already planted mat grass and plant rice instead. Some agricultural cooperatives were afraid that members would privately feed chickens and ducks and waste grain, so some activists took the lead in throwing stones randomly, and killing chickens and ducks was not only not criticized, but the cooperative also gave rewards. Members reflected, "After joining the cooperative, we can't even pick a few eggs to buy some oil and salt!"

Due to unreasonable purchase prices and the agricultural cooperatives' overly strict restrictions on the use of labor, many valuable wild medicinal materials in hilly and mountainous areas were discarded on the mountains without being collected. For example, the famous Chinese medicine and dye gallnut in western Hunan, which used to produce more than 23,000 dan per year, has now dropped to about 9,000 dan. On the other hand, the market is very short of these materials, creating a tight supply and demand situation.

In addition, many people in rural areas believe that engaging in sideline production and diversified operations is taking the spontaneous road of capitalism. Coupled with the fact that the financial and economic departments have set unreasonable purchase prices for certain agricultural and sideline products, many cash crops and sideline productions that had declined before liberation but are closely related to people's lives and national construction have grown very slowly in the years after liberation. And these products used to be a major source of income for farmers in Hunan. For example, tea oil, which has the largest output in the country, the famous Xiangxi tung oil, and tea gardens all over the province, have not been reclaimed since they were abandoned before liberation, and the output has not yet recovered to the level before the Anti-Japanese War. Many lotus lakes in the famous Xianglian producing areas of the Dongting Lake area have also been abandoned, and the current output is only one-fifteenth of that before the Anti-Japanese War.

Because of abandoning diversified operations and rejecting sideline production, on the one hand, the income of the members is affected, and on the other hand, the amount of commodities in the market is greatly reduced. This has contributed to the situation of the peak season not being prosperous and the peak season being late in coming. According to the trial distribution results of Lianyi and Liantong and other three agricultural cooperatives in Yuhe Township, Linxiang County: although the grain production of these three cooperatives increased by 62.4% this year compared to last year, because they ignored cash crops and sideline production, which account for 45% of the members' income, not only can some members not increase their income, but 20% of the members of the Liantong cooperative will also have reduced income. Many members also feel a lack of spending money for daily life needs.

In July of this year, the First Congress of the Communist Party of China in Hunan Province made a profound criticism of the bias of rural cadres and farmers in unilaterally emphasizing rice production while neglecting diversified operations. Recently, the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has also conducted research and made specific arrangements, requiring party committees and government leading departments at all levels to strengthen the field management of late rice, and at the same time, must combine production and disaster relief to vigorously develop diversified operations in accordance with local conditions. Many agricultural cooperatives have now learned lessons from the facts and are re-revising production plans and comprehensively developing diversified operations and sideline production. It is expected that a prosperous scene will appear in the rural market after autumn.

    放弃了多种经营的恶果
    新华社记者　罗厚仁
    今年湖南的早稻丰收了，现在中稻又开始上市，经过试算分配，许多农业社增加了产量。照例说农村市场的旺季应该老早到来了，但是，事实却恰恰相反。许多集镇没有从前那样热闹，逢场赶墟的交易时间也比过去缩短。7月份湖南省供销合作系统的农村市场零售总额，反而比6月份下降了12.46％。据三个农村初级市场的典型调查，7月份的零售总额比6月下降了22.93％。这种趋势8月上旬仍在继续发展，许多地方直到现在还是没有显著起色，供销合作系统和采购部门的收购计划也完成得不好。
    在稻谷丰收的条件下，为什么今年旺季湖南农村市场出现这样的情况呢？其原因是多种多样的，其中最值得注意的是，许多地方的干部和农民在发展生产上单一化，只注意稻谷千斤亩，没有很好地开展多种经营。
    湖南是粮产区，抓住稻谷生产是正确的。但是，湖南人多地少，农民历来就有多种经营的习惯，而且经济作物和副业生产在农村占着很大的比重。近几年，特别是去年冬季以来，有些干部和农民陶醉于稻谷千斤亩的指标，把搞副业和旱土作物的劳动日的工分规定得很低，因而把多种经营放弃了。在著名的产茶区安化和新化等县，甚至出现有些农业社阻止社员出工采茶，使茶叶老在树上没人采摘，造成今年春茶减产。在湘潭、黔阳等专区也有不准社员往麻土里送粪施肥和从林区采运木材等现象。攸县一些出产席草的地方，一亩席草的收益比两亩稻谷还多，可是，今年春天，干部硬叫农民把已经插下的席草拔掉改种稻子。有些农业社怕社员私喂鸡鸭糟蹋粮食，一些积极分子就带头拿石头乱打，打死了鸡鸭不但不批评，社里还给以奖励。社员反映说：“入了社想检几个蛋买点油盐吃都不行了！”
    由于收购价格不合理和农业社对劳动力的使用限制得太死，在丘陵区和山区有许多价值很高的野生药材丢弃在山上无人采掘。如湘西等地的著名的中药和染料五棓子，过去年产二万三千多担，现在下降到九千担左右。而另一方面市场却非常缺少这些物资，造成供求关系紧张的局面。
    此外，在农村中还有不少人认为搞副业和多种经营是走资本主义的自发道路，加上财经部门对某些农产品和副业产品的收购价格规定得不合理等原因，许多在解放前已衰落，但是同人民生活和国家建设有密切关系的经济作物和副业生产，在解放后几年内也增长很慢。而这些产品过去是湖南农民的一项主要收入。如产量占全国第一位的茶油、著名的湘西桐油，以及遍布全省各县的茶园，解放前荒芜以后一直没有垦复过来，产量仍未恢复到抗日战争前的水平。著名的湘莲产区洞庭湖滨各县的许多莲湖也荒废了，现在的产量只及抗日战争前的十五分之一。
    因为放弃多种经营和排斥了副业生产，一方面社员的收入受到影响，另一方面市场的商品量也大大减少。这样便促成市场旺季不旺和旺季迟迟到来的情况。据临湘县玉禾乡联益、联同等三个农业社分配试算到户结果：今年这三个社的粮食虽比去年增产62.4％，但因为忽视了占社员收入45％的经济作物和副业生产，不但部分社员不能增加收入，联同社还有20％的社员要减少收入。许多社员对日常生活需要的零花钱也感到缺乏。
    今年7月间，中共湖南省第一次代表大会曾对农村干部和农民片面强调稻谷生产而忽视多种经营的偏向作了深刻的批判。最近，中共湖南省委又作了研究和具体安排，要求各级党委和政府领导部门在加强晚稻田间管理的同时，必须结合生产救灾因地制宜地大力开展多种经营。许多农业社现在也从事实中得到了教训，正在重新修订生产计划，全面开展多种经营和副业生产，预计秋后的农村市场将会出现繁荣的景象。
