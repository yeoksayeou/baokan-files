Xinhua News Agency, September 7th, TASS Beirut dispatch: Lebanese newspapers report that Lebanese President Camille Chamoun summoned the US and British ambassadors to Beirut on September 5th, requesting them to explain the assembly of British and French troops in the Eastern Mediterranean.

According to "The Daily Star," the President told the two ambassadors that Lebanon fully supports Egypt's nationalization of the Suez Canal Company, and if Egypt is attacked or boycotted, all Arab countries will come to Egypt's aid.

The President insisted that the Suez issue must be resolved peacefully.

Xinhua News Agency, September 7th, TASS Beirut, September 6th dispatch: According to Beirut Radio, Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Said summoned the British Ambassador to Baghdad, telling him that the Iraqi government demands that the assembly of British troops in Cyprus be stopped. He pointed out to the British Ambassador that the Suez Canal issue must be resolved peacefully.

Xinhua News Agency, September 7th, Amman News: Jordanian Foreign Minister Said said on September 6th that Jordan is uneasy about the assembly of British and French troops in Cyprus.

He stated that he would ask the British and French ambassadors to Jordan for an explanation of the matter.

Said told reporters that Jordan is currently conducting high-level consultations with other Arab countries. He said that the consultations include studying joint actions to deal with the Western countries' military movements.

He accused Britain and France of attempting to exert pressure on Egypt during the Suez Canal issue talks in Cairo. He said: "I hope that reason will prevail, especially on the part of Western countries."

Xinhua News Agency, September 7th, Tunis News: During the holiday of Tunisian Prime Minister Bourguiba, Deputy Prime Minister Radham, who is acting as Prime Minister, warned reporters when talking about the Suez Canal issue that any attempt by Britain and France to launch a "crusade" against Egyptian President Nasser for political purposes would cause serious turmoil throughout the Arab world.

He said, "In our view, Egypt controls the area through which the canal passes—where it has sovereignty and the right to nationalize the companies located there.

"At the same time, we believe that as an international waterway that is very important for the trade of many countries, the Suez Canal should be open to ships of all countries on equal terms."

He said that he strongly hopes that the two sides will negotiate.

Xinhua News Agency, September 7th, Cairo News: Cairo Radio published a commentary on September 6th, saying that any aggressive action by Britain and France in the Middle East will immediately encounter "united resistance" from Arab countries. This aggression will also be contained and repelled by volunteer armies from various countries.

The radio said that the strong protests made by Arab governments to the British and French governments regarding the assembly of British and French troops in Cyprus fully demonstrate "the unity of Arab countries in resisting imperialist conspiracies against Arab countries."

    据“日报”说，这位总统向这两位大使说，黎巴嫩完全赞成埃及把苏彝士运河公司收归国有，而且如果埃及遭到攻击和抵制的话，所有的阿拉伯国家都要来援助埃及。
    总统坚持说，苏彝士问题必须用和平方式解决。
    新华社7日讯　塔斯社贝鲁特6日讯：据贝鲁特电台广播，伊拉克首相努里·赛义德召见了英国驻巴格达大使，告诉他说，伊拉克政府要求停止把英国军队集结在塞浦路斯。他向英国大使指出，必须以和平方式解决苏彝士运河问题。
    新华社7日讯　安曼消息：约旦外交大臣赛义德9月6日说，约旦对英法军队在塞浦路斯集结这件事感到不安。
    他表示，他将要求驻约旦的英国和法国大使对这件事加以解释。
    赛义德对记者说，约旦目前正在同其他的阿拉伯国家进行高级会商。他说，会商的内容包括研究对付西方国家军事调动的联合行动。

    他说，“依我们看，埃及控制住运河所通过的地带——在那里它有主权和把设在那里的公司收归国有的权利。
