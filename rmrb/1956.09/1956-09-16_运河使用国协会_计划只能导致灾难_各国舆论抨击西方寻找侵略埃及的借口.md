Xinhua News Agency, September 14th: TASS Washington, September 13th: The "Washington Post and Times Herald" published an editorial criticizing the Western "Suez Canal Users Association" plan. The newspaper said that Western countries are attempting to "actually take control of the management rights of the canal themselves (in this respect, they cannot obtain Egypt's consent). The legal basis for this approach is questionable." Drafting this plan is to justify Eden's so-called "further plans."

The newspaper's editorial said that many people in the West "recognize Egypt's sovereignty over the canal. There is no doubt that the Suez Canal Company is an Egyptian enterprise." Therefore, the right to manage the canal belongs to Egypt, not to the countries that use the canal. The newspaper concluded that the Western plan would violate Egypt's right to nationalized property.

Xinhua News Agency, September 14th, London News: Prime Minister Eden's statement in the House of Commons on September 12 regarding the government's policy on the Suez Canal issue has aroused dissatisfaction among British public opinion, which believes that this is equivalent to announcing a policy of force against Egypt.

The Labour Party's left-wing "Tribune" weekly pointed out that Eden's proposed plan to establish a so-called Canal Users Organization is essentially nothing more than an attempt to force Egypt to accept the demands made by Western countries.

The weekly pointed out that the British people oppose the government's policy and called on all aspects of the British labor movement to mobilize to prevent Britain from being dragged into a wicked and disastrous war.

Labour Party left-wing leader Bevan published an article in the "Tribune" weekly, advocating a peaceful resolution of the Suez Canal issue, and criticizing Britain and France for deliberately sidelining the United Nations in this conflict.

The prominent clergyman Dr. Donald Soper also supported Bevan's views.

The Labour Party's organ, the "Daily Herald," emphasized that implementing a "policy of strength" will deepen the division between East and West and undermine the unity among Commonwealth countries, because India, Ceylon, and some other countries firmly oppose the use of force on the Suez Canal issue.

The Liberal Party's "Manchester Guardian" called for a policy of "patient negotiation and abandonment of provocation" in accordance with the principles of the United Nations. The newspaper's editorial accused Eden's policy of "only leading to disaster," which would lead Britain to war, or else lead Britain to complete diplomatic failure.

Xinhua News Agency, September 14th: Parisian democratic newspapers fiercely criticized the plan to establish a "Canal Users Association," considering it a new trick by the defenders of dictatorial policies.

"Liberation" condemned the plan as a provocative action seeking an excuse for military intervention. "Humanity" said that the British and French governments have long known that Egypt will never agree to this crude trampling of Egypt's sovereignty and measures that simply amount to canceling the nationalization of the canal. It seems that London and Paris are attempting to find excuses to create a complex situation at any cost. The newspaper called on all peace defenders to be vigilant and crush the adventurous plan against the Egyptian people.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi: Political leaders in the Indian capital strongly condemned the conspiracy of the United States, Britain, and France to plan the "Canal Users Association."

Indian Communist Party General Secretary Ajoy Ghosh said in a statement on September 13 that the wording used by Eden when announcing the British and French plans for the (Suez) "Canal Users Association" could not help but remind people of 19th-century colonialism.

The statement also condemned Western countries for intensifying military preparations while instructing non-Egyptian pilots to stop working. The statement said, "This is a blatant trick aimed at disrupting canal traffic and creating incidents to find an excuse for imperialist aggression."

On the same day, Indian Communist Party Parliamentary Group leader Gopalan said at a press conference that Eden's speech was a clear provocation of war, and he demanded that the Indian government immediately issue a statement supporting Egypt.

Congress Party leader N.G. Ranga said that the actions of Western countries are blatant colonialism in this era of national revolution.

Indian National Trade Union Congress leader K.P. Tripathi pointed out that the British government's actions only illustrate the colonialists' theory of supranational sovereignty, that is, the sovereignty of other countries can be trampled upon if it hinders the interests of colonial countries.

On September 14, newspapers in New Delhi also unanimously condemned the Western countries' proposal to establish a "Canal Users Association," considering it a loud and aggressive war provocation.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, September 15th: Colombo News: The "Ceylon Observer" editorial on September 13 said that Western countries, in dealing with the Suez Canal issue, have abandoned the political conscience of the country, the sense of responsibility to world public opinion, and the respect for the established institutions for resolving world disputes.

The "Ceylon Daily News" said that in this dark moment, the only hope for peace lies in gathering the power of world public opinion to exert sufficient pressure on the West as a way to curb war.

Xinhua News Agency, September 15th: According to a report by the Yugoslav News Agency: The "Combat Daily" on September 14 wrote: Eden's new plan, mentioned in the House of Commons, to establish a so-called "Canal Users Association" leaves Egypt with only one choice: either agree to cooperate with the "Canal Users Association" or be accused of violating conventions on freedom of navigation.

The newspaper's commentator pointed out that unilateral decisions and attempts to force Egypt to accept such decisions through pressure cannot be a substitute for negotiation.

The "Political Daily's" commentator wrote: The suggestion about establishing the so-called Suez Canal Users Association sounds more like an order than a suitable way to seek to continue negotiations.

Xinhua News Agency, September 15th, TASS Bonn, September 14th: The head of the West German Social Democratic Party's press and propaganda department, Fritz Heine, issued a statement on the US, British, and French decision to establish a "Suez Canal Users Association," saying: "This step cannot promote a peaceful resolution of the Suez Canal issue."

Heine said that German residents firmly reject measures that may lead to military intervention.

The German Social Democratic Party's "Social Democratic News Bulletin" wrote that the Western countries' proposed plan for a "Canal Users Association" is a "very dangerous speculation." The newspaper expressed opposition to the use of force to resolve the Suez Canal issue. Some other newspapers in West Germany also expressed the same opinion.

Xinhua News Agency, September 14th: According to TASS Rome, September 13th: The leadership of the Italian Socialist Party issued a statement saying that the Italian Socialist Party "firmly condemns any measures to resolve the Suez Canal issue by force" and "demands that the government never allow Italy to be directly or indirectly involved in a policy of strength, but instead propose and implement a proposal that advocates a mutually agreed solution through consultation." Some Italian newspapers belonging to different parties also expressed dissatisfaction with the attitude of Western countries in obstructing a fair resolution of the Suez Canal issue. The Italian Communist Party's organ "Unity" stated, when talking about the decision of the United States, Britain, and France to establish a "Suez Canal Users Association," that this is a "unilateral action that, both legally and factually, is a crude violation of Egyptian sovereignty." The Italian Social Democratic Party's organ "Justice" also condemned "the imperialist ambitions held by the most reactionary conservatives in Britain."

Xinhua News Agency, September 14th, Canberra News: Australian opposition Labor Party leader Herbert Evatt said on the 13th that the decision of Britain, France, and the United States to establish a "Canal Users Association" increased the danger of war.

Evatt's statement was issued after a meeting was held by the Labor Party's parliamentary group and the leaders of the Labor Party's federal executive committee.

He said that it is very urgent that he believes the Suez Canal issue should be immediately submitted to the United Nations before the situation further deteriorates.

    “运河使用国协会”计划只能导致灾难
    各国舆论抨击西方寻找侵略埃及的借口
    美国
    据新华社14日讯塔斯社华盛顿13日讯：“华盛顿邮报和时代先驱报”发表社论，抨击西方的“苏彝士运河使用国协会”的计划。这家报纸说，西方国家企图“实际上自己掌握管理运河的权利（在这方面，它们无法得到埃及的同意。）这种做法的法律基础是值得怀疑的”。草拟这个计划是为艾登所说的“进一步计划”作辩护。
    报纸的社论说，西方的许多人士“承认埃及对运河的主权，毫无疑问，苏彝士运河公司是埃及的企业”，因此，管理运河的权利是属于埃及的，而不是属于使用运河的国家的。这家报纸最后说，西方的计划将侵犯埃及对收归国有的财产的权利。
    英国
  据新华社14日讯伦敦消息：艾登首相9月12日在下院就政府对苏彝士运河问题的政策发表的声明引起了英国舆论的不满，舆论认为这等于宣布要对埃及实行武力政策。
    工党左翼的“论坛”周报指出，艾登提出的建立所谓运河使用国组织的计划实质上无非是想强迫埃及接受西方国家提出的要求。
    这家周报指出英国人民反对政府这种政策，并且呼吁英国工人运动的各方面动员起来防止把英国投入一场邪恶的、灾难性的战争中去。
    工党左翼领袖比万在“论坛”周报发表文章，主张和平解决苏彝士运河问题，并且指责英国和法国在这个冲突中有意撇开联合国。
    著名教会人士唐纳德·索佩尔博士也支持比万的主张。
    工党机关报“每日先驱报”着重指出，执行“实力政策”将加深东西方之间的分裂和破坏英联邦国家之间的团结，因为印度，锡兰和其他一些国家坚决反对在苏彝士运河问题上使用武力。
    自由党的“曼彻斯特卫报”要求按照联合国的原则实行“耐心谈判、放弃挑衅”的政策。这家报纸的社论指责，艾登的政策“只能导致灾难”，它将把英国引向战争，不然就会把英国引向彻底的外交失败。
    法国
  据新华社14日讯巴黎民主报刊激烈抨击建立“运河使用国协会”的计划，认为这是独裁政策维护者的新花招。
    “解放报”谴责这个计划是为军事干涉寻找借口的挑衅行动。“人道报”说，英法两国政府早就知道，埃及绝不会同意这种粗暴地蹂躏埃及的主权和简直等于取消运河国有化的措施。看来似乎是伦敦和巴黎企图不惜任何代价地为制造复杂的局势寻找借口。报纸号召全体和平保卫者提高警惕，粉碎反对埃及人民的冒险计划。
    印度
    据新华社新德里电　印度首都政界领袖们强烈谴责美、英、法三国策划“运河使用国协会”的阴谋。
    印度共产党总书记阿约艾·高士在9月13日发表声明说，艾登在宣布英法两国关于（苏彝士）“运河使用国协会”的计划的时候所用的字眼使人不禁想起十九世纪的殖民主义。
    声明还谴责西方国家在加紧进行军事准备的同时，指示非埃及籍的领航员停止工作。声明说，“这是一种目的在于破坏运河交通和制造事件来为帝国主义者的侵略寻找借口的露骨的伎俩”。
    同日，印度共产党国会党团领袖高普兰在记者招待会上说，艾登的演说是明显的战争挑衅，他要求印度政府立即发表声明支持埃及。
    国大党领袖约·格·兰加说，西方国家的行动是在这个民族革命时代中的露骨的殖民主义。
    印度全国职工大会领袖卡·普·特里帕蒂指出，英国政府的行动只不过说明了殖民主义者超主权的理论，这就是说，其他国家的主权可以加以践踏，如果它妨碍了殖民国家的利益的话。
    9月14日新德里各报也一致谴责西方国家关于设立“运河使用国协会”的建议，认为这是大叫大嚷的战争挑衅。
    锡兰
    据新华社新德里15日电　科伦坡消息：“锡兰观察家报”9月13日的社论说，西方国家在处理苏彝士运河问题时已经抛开了国家的政治良心，对世界舆论的责任感，对已经建立的解决世界争端的机构的尊重。
    “锡兰每日新闻”说，在这个黑暗的时刻，和平的唯一希望就在于集合世界舆论的力量对西方施加足够的压力，来作为遏制战争的办法。
    南斯拉夫
    据新华社15日讯　据南斯拉夫通讯社报道：9月14日的“战斗报”写道：艾登在下院所谈到的成立所谓“运河使用国协会”的新计划，是使埃及只有下面一种选择：要么同意同“运河使用国协会”进行合作，要么就被指责为违反关于通航自由的公约。
    这家报纸的评论员指出，片面的决定以及通过压力强迫埃及接受这种决定的那种企图，都不能成为替代谈判的办法。
    “政治报”的评论员写道：关于成立所谓苏彝士运河使用国协会的那种建议倒像是一种号令，而不像是一种寻求继续进行谈判的某种适当方式的办法。
    西德
  据新华社15日讯塔斯社波恩14日讯：西德社会民主党报刊和宣传部门领导人弗里茨·海涅就美、英、法三国决定建立“苏彝士运河使用国协会”一事发表声明说：“这个步骤不能促成苏彝士运河问题的和平解决”。
    海涅说，德国居民坚决拒绝采取可能导致军事干涉的措施。
    德国社会民主党的“社会民主新闻公报”写道，西方国家提出的关于“运河使用国协会”的计划是“非常危险的投机行为”。这家报纸表示反对用武力来解决苏彝士运河问题。西德的一些其他报纸也表示相同意见。
    意大利
    据新华社14日讯　据塔斯社罗马13日讯：意大利社会党领导机构发表声明说，意大利社会党“坚决谴责借武力解决苏彝士运河问题的任何措施”，并且“要求政府绝不让意大利直接或间接地牵扯到实力政策中去，而是提出和实现一个主张通过协商取得大家同意的解决办法的建议”。属于不同党派的一些意大利报纸也对西方国家阻挠苏彝士运河问题公平解决的态度表示不满。意大利共产党机关报“团结报”在谈到美英法三国关于建立“苏彝士运河使用国协会”的决定的时候，认为这是一种“片面的行动，无论在法律上和事实上，都是粗暴地侵犯埃及主权的做法”。意大利社会民主党机关报“正义报”也谴责“英国最反动的保守党人所抱的帝国主义野心”。
    澳大利亚
    据新华社14日讯　堪培拉消息：澳大利亚反对党工党领袖赫伯特·伊瓦特13日说，英法美建立“运河使用国协会”的决定增加了战争的危险。
    伊瓦特的声明是在工党议会党团和工党的联邦执行委员会的领袖们所举行的一次会议以后发表的。
    他说，十分迫切的是，他认为苏彝士运河问题要在局势进一步变坏以前立即提交联合国。
