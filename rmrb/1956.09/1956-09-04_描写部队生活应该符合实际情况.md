    Descriptions of Military Life Should Conform to Reality
    There are some inaccuracies in the poem "The Photographer Comes to the Island" written by Comrade Han Xiao (see page 8 of the People's Daily, August 19th). The poem says: "One new recruit was really long-winded, making the photographer lose his own ideas. He straightened his cap, then touched his shoulder boards, saying his belt was too tight, and then complaining that his leather shoes weren't shiny enough." In fact, a new recruit may be long-winded, but he wears a garrison cap, which doesn't need to be "straightened," and he also doesn't have "shoulder boards" or a "belt." The soldiers' shoes are also suede, and cannot be polished, nor will they shine. I hope that in describing military life, we should make it conform to the actual situation.

    描写部队生活应该符合实际情况
    韩笑同志写的“摄影师来到岛上”一首诗（见8月19日人民日报第八版），有些地方写的不大对头。这首诗写着：“有一个新兵实在啰嗦，把摄影师也弄得没有主张。他正一正帽子，又摸一摸肩章，说皮带扎得太紧，又嫌皮鞋擦得不亮。”其实，一个新兵，也许是啰嗦的，但他戴的是船形帽，是不需要戴得“正”的，而且他也没有“肩章”，也不会有“皮带”；战士的皮鞋也是翻毛的，不能擦油，也不会发亮。我希望在描写部队生活时，应该使之符合现实情况。　　第五○三二部队　大方
