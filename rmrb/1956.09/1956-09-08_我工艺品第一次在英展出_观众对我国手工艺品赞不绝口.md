Xinhua News Agency, London, 7th. The Fourth International Handicrafts Exhibition opened here on September 6th at the Empire Hall. At this exhibition, Chinese handicrafts with a long tradition are being exhibited to the British public for the first time.

The Chinese exhibition hall is decorated in the style of a traditional garden house, with an octagonal pavilion and brightly colored window frames covered with artificial vines. This exhibition hall attracted the most visitors. Whether British or foreign, they all praised the exquisite ivory carvings, jade carvings, cloisonné and lacquerware. What everyone was most interested in and admired was the clay figurine performance by folk artist Lang Shao'an. Visitors surrounded him, watching him skillfully create Peking opera characters, fairy tale figures, and guards of the Queen of England.

Gu Wenxia, a girl from Suzhou, also received praise from the guests for her embroidery performance.

The exhibition was opened by the former Labour Party leader, Earl Attlee. In his brief opening remarks, he pointed out that this exhibition is a good way to promote mutual understanding. Afterwards, Attlee, accompanied by Huan Xiang, the Chinese Chargé d'Affaires, and Pei Zesheng, the head of the Chinese exhibition delegation, visited the Chinese pavilion. Attlee was very interested in the scenery of Beihai Park in Beijing, carved from a whole piece of ivory. He said that he had personally visited there two years ago.

Works by handicraftsmen from all over Britain who participated in this year's British handicrafts competition are also on display at the exhibition.

This exhibition is organized by the British magazine "Folk Handicrafts," which was founded nine years ago.

    我工艺品第一次在英展出
    观众对我国手工艺品赞不绝口
    据新华社伦敦7日电　第四届国际工艺展览会9月6日在这里的帝国大厅开幕。在这个展览会上，有悠久传统的中国手工艺品第一次向英国社会人士展出。
    中国展览馆是按传统的庭园式房屋布置的，里面有八角形亭榭，它那色彩鲜明的窗格上爬着假葡萄藤。这个展览馆吸引了最多的参观者。不论是英国人或外国人，当他们看到精致的象牙雕刻品、玉石雕刻品、景泰蓝和漆器的时候都赞不绝口。最使大家感到兴趣和赞叹的是民间艺人郎绍安的捏面人表演。参观的人都围着他，看他巧妙地捏成京戏角色、童话人物和英国女王的卫士。
    苏州女孩顾文霞表演的刺绣也受到来宾的称赞。
    展览会是由前工党领袖艾德礼伯爵主持开幕的。他在简短的开幕词里指出，这个展览会是促进相互谅解的好办法。随后艾德礼由中国代办宦乡和中国展览团团长裴泽生陪同，参观了中国馆。艾德礼对用整根象牙雕成的北京北海公园风景很感兴趣。他说，他在两年前亲身在那里游览过。
    曾经参加今年英国手工艺品竞赛的英国各地手工艺者的作品也在展览会上展出。
    这个展览会是九年前创刊的英国“民间手工艺”杂志举办的。
