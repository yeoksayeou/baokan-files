    On Buying Books
    Xidi

    Buying "books" is not a simple or easy matter, nor can it be solved by simply sending someone from the General Affairs Department to run to a bookstore. Buying "books" requires some effort and experience. Personally, browsing and selecting in a bookstore is endlessly enjoyable. Buying floral fabric at a cloth store requires careful selection, let alone buying "books." "Books" are diverse, with the most complex patterns. There are Chinese books and foreign books. Chinese books are further divided into new books, old books, ancient books, paperback books, thread-bound books, literary books, science books, classics, philosophical works, historical works, and collected works, and so on. Foreign books are even more numerous, besides the different languages, such as Russian, French, English, Japanese, etc., and besides a large number of literary works, natural sciences alone have countless specialized subjects, and only experts in the field can select them; otherwise, they won't even understand the "titles." Buying foreign magazines is even more troublesome and must be done according to the experts' specifications. Otherwise, a large sum of money will be spent, but the purchase will be useless because of making a mistake, which will inevitably lead to frustration. The state's foreign exchange should not be spent so wastefully!

    Since the advocacy of marching towards science, various academic research institutions and universities have been purchasing large quantities of new books, especially newly established or soon-to-be-established research institutions and schools, who are even more active in buying "books." They often send special personnel to Beijing and Shanghai to buy "books." They always return fully loaded. Not only new books but also ancient and old books are in a state of "short supply." After an antique bookstore prints a catalog, the ancient books in the catalog, whether well-preserved or poorly-preserved, Ming Dynasty or Qing Dynasty editions, are all swept away within a few days. There are several books of which there is only one copy, but several units want them at the same time. "Who should we give it to?" They often hesitate like this. Compared with the "desolate" situation last year, there is a world of difference. Now, looking at the shelves of their old shops, the long-standing antiques have almost all been sold. The shelves are gradually becoming empty. They are a little worried. How to solve the "source" problem? And the buyers keep coming, and with great momentum.

    "How many books do you have here?" A customer from outside asked the people at the Shanghai Ancient Book Store, which had just opened for three days.

    "Around 150,000 volumes."

    "I want all 150,000 volumes! Please prepare a list of the books within a few days so that I can pay." Many shop assistants in this store, even the manager, were frightened by him. The "books" were all sold out after only three days of opening. How would they maintain the business in the future? And this big deal was hard to refuse. What to do? They hesitated greatly. The outcome is unknown, but it seems that the deal was not made, and they turned him down with polite words. Otherwise, that "Ancient Book Store" would not still be open today. This Black Whirlwind-style customer can be described as extremely brave and daring. Among those 150,000 ancient books, there are many duplicate copies, many useless books, and many kinds of books that only certain experts who have special research on certain subjects can use or even understand, but he bought them all in one go, regardless of everything. A few years ago, there was such a thing. Every year at the end of the year, if a certain agency or university had a surplus of funds for buying books, they would send someone to Xinhua Bookstore to buy one to three copies of each book, regardless of whether it was useful or not. "I want them all!" Their generous voice could be heard. Even more straightforward was, "Get me 30,000 yuan worth of books!" As a result, the books that had been stockpiled and unsold at Xinhua Bookstore every year were mostly cleared out at this time. It is said that the above-mentioned customer was buying "books" for a university that was being prepared. And that university only offered "science" courses in the first few years, and no "arts" courses. So, what was the use of buying those 150,000 ancient books? Was it for "rainy day preparedness," fearing that they would not be able to buy them later?

    Here's another joke. A buyer came to Shanghai's Lai Xun Pavilion and saw that several bookshelves on a wall were still full of ancient books. He asked, "What are these books on the shelves?"

    "They are collected works."

    "They are collected works, I want them all!" What a big tone! I don't know if the deal was eventually made.

    Tao Menghe, the director of the Library of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, told me that a certain research institute located in a province sent someone with several copies of the foreign magazine catalog printed by the International Bookstore, asking the library to subscribe to all of them. One could hear the voice: "I want them all!" But there were more than 3,000 kinds in total! The categories were very complex, and some were only "annual reports" or "conference reports," which would be useless if bought. Mr. Tao flipped through them and turned him down.

    "You have to choose carefully; you can't buy them all!"

    This attitude is right. There must be a "checkpoint" to review the actions of those reckless people who spend money and buy "books" indiscriminately. Otherwise, jokes will continue to emerge endlessly. Making jokes is not a big deal, but wasting the state's useful funds and stockpiling materials that should be supplied to other experts for research is not a "small matter."

    I suggest that if you want to buy "books," the book list must be drawn up by "experts." The personnel of research units or university libraries only compile the lists opened by various "experts" to "buy" books. Even public libraries should always consult local experts, understand their needs, and then start "buying."

    Anyone who comes to buy a large number of "books" without a "book list," whether at a new or ancient bookstore or an international bookstore, should have the right to be turned down.

    "Please bring a book list if you want to buy something!"

    Someone who can produce a "book list" is an expert or at least someone who is close to being an "expert," who is quite reasonable, and has some specialized training.

    谈买书
    西谛
    买“书”不是一件简单、容易的事，也不是派某某总务科的工作人员，出去到书店里跑一趟就能解决问题的。买“书”是要花费一些工夫的，是要有些经验的。就个人说来，在书店里东张西望，东挑西选，其本身就有无穷乐趣。到布店里买花布，还得东挑西拣，何况乎买“书”。“书”是多种多样的，花色最为复杂。有中文书，有外文书。中文书里又分新书、旧书、古书、平装书、线装书、文艺书、科学书、经书、子书，和史部书、集部书等等。外文书的门类更为繁多了，除了文字的不同，像俄文、法文、英文、日文等等之外，又除了大批的文艺作品之外，单是自然科学一类，就有无数的专门项目，非搞这一行的专家来挑选，是连“书名”都不会弄得明白的。买外文杂志，更为麻烦，也必须经过专家的指定，方才可去订阅。否则花了大价钱，买了回来，“张冠李戴”，全无用处，未免要一场懊丧。国家的外汇不应该花得这样冤枉！
    且说，自从提倡向科学进军以来，各个学术研究机关，各个大专科学校，都在大量的添购新书，特别是新成立或将要成立的研究机构和学校，买“书”更为积极。他们常派了专人到北京和上海来买“书”。来一趟，总是满载而归。不要说新书了，就是古、旧书也有“供不应求”之概。一家古书店印出了一册书目，不到几天，书目里的古书，不论好板、坏板，明板、清板，全都一扫而空。有若干种书，仅只有一部的，却同时有好几个单位来要。“倒底给谁好呢？”他们常常这样的迟疑着。比起去年“门可罗雀”的情况来，真有天渊之别。现在看看他们几家老铺子的书架上，陈年老古董已经出脱得差不多了。架上渐渐地空虚起来。他们有些着急。“来源”问题怎么解决呢？而买的人还是源源而来，而且气魄来得大。
    “你们这里一共有多少书？”一个外来的顾客向刚开张三天的上海古籍书店里的人问道。
    “有十五万册上下。”
    “这十五万册书，我全要！请在几天之内就开好书单，我好付款。”这家店里的许多伙计，乃至经理等，全给他吓唬住了。只开张了三天，而“书”全卖空了，以后将怎么维持下去呢？而这一大笔买卖又难于推却。怎么办呢？大费踌躇。下文不知如何？好像是不曾成交，而被他们用婉辞给挡回去了。否则，那家“古籍书店”不会到今天还开张着。这位黑旋风式的顾客，可谓勇敢无比，大胆之至的了。在那十五万册古书里，有多少复本书，有多少没用的书，有多少种的书，非对某种科目特别有研究的某些专家是根本上用不着的，甚至也不会看得懂的，他却不管三七二十一，一古脑儿“包买”了下来。前几年，有过这么一会事。每到年底，某某机关或某某大学，购书的经费有剩余，就派人到新华书店，不管有用没用，每部买个一本到三本。“我全要！”如闻其慷慨之声。更干脆的是，“替我配个三万元的书！”于是，每年在新华书店积压不销的书，至此乃出清一大部分。听说，上述的那位顾客是替一个正在筹备中的大学买“书”的。而那个大学在开头几年之内，还只办“理科”，没有“文科”。那末，买这十五万册古书何用？是为了“未雨绸缪”，生怕以后买不到？
    又是一个笑话。一个买主到了上海来熏阁，看见一堵墙面的几个书架上还满满地堆满了古书，就问道：“这些架上都是些什么书？”
    “是集部书”。
    “是集部书，我全要！”口气好大！也不知后来究竟成交了没有。
    中国科学院图书馆馆长陶孟和先生告诉我：有某一个设在外省的研究所，派人拿了好几册国际书店印的外文杂志目录，要求图书馆替他们全部预订一份。如闻其声：“我全要！”但全部是三千多种呢！门类复杂得很，也有些只是“年报”或“会务报告”性质的东西，买了来，根本没用。陶先生翻了翻，就把他给顶回去了。
    “要好好地挑选一下，不能全买！”
    这个态度是对的。要有一个“关口”，审查一下那些乱花钱，乱买“书”的莽汉们的所作所为方是。否则，笑话还要层出不穷。闹笑话倒不打紧，损失国家有用的资金，积压应该供给别的专家们的研究的资料，那才不是“小事”呢。
    我建议：如果要买“书”，书目非由“专家”开出不可。各研究单位或大学图书馆的人员，只是综合了各位“专家”所开的单子去“买”书而已。就是公共图书馆也应该时时请教当地的专家们，了解他们的需要，再动手“买”。
    没有拿“书单子”而来买大批“书”的人，不论新古书店或国际书店，均可以有权给他们顶回去。
    “要买什么，请拿书单子来！”
    开得出“书单子”来的，那便是一位专家，或至少是一位接近于“专家”的颇有道理的，有些专门修养的人了。
