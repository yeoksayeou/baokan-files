Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 30th -- Guangdong Province, which possesses abundant aquatic resources in the South China Sea, exports its seafood products to various parts of Asia, Europe, and America. The export volume and sales scope are gradually expanding. Currently, Guangdong's seafood export department has established direct business relationships with more than seventy foreign companies. There are over thirty types of seafood products exported, including various kinds of salted fish, bright red and delicious dried shrimp without shells, and cuttlefish, a renowned delicacy recognized in foreign markets. Other seafood products such as oysters, fresh shrimp, and squid are also popular overseas. Last year, the total export value of Guangdong's seafood increased by two and a half times compared to 1951, and it is expected to increase by about one-third this year compared to last year.

Guangdong Province has abundant seafood production with a wide variety of species and great export potential. Currently, the annual export volume is less than 5% of the total production. China National Foodstuffs Import & Export Corporation Guangzhou Branch, Guangdong Provincial Department of Aquatic Products, and other relevant departments are preparing to build fishmeal factories next year to export large quantities of fishmeal needed overseas, and are also seeking ways to improve the quality of exported seafood in order to export more and better seafood in the future.

    广东海产远销欧美
    新华社广州30日电　拥有南海丰富水产资源的广东省出产的海产品，已远销到亚洲各地和欧洲、美洲等地，出口量和销售范围逐步扩大。目前广东海产品出口部门已经和国外七十多家商号建立了直接的业务关系，海产品出口的种类共三十多种。其中有各种咸鱼，有颜色鲜红、无外壳、味道鲜美的虾米，有在国外市场上被公认是名贵的海味尤鱼，其它如蚝、鲜虾、墨鱼等多种海产品也都受海外各处的欢迎。去年广东省海产品的出口总值比1951年增加了两倍半，预计今年又将比去年增加三分之一左右。
    广东省的海产品产量丰富，品种繁多，出口潜力很大，目前全年出口的数量还不到总产量的5％。中国食品出口公司广州分公司、广东省水产厅等有关部门，准备在明年兴建鱼粉厂，大量出口海外各地需要的鱼粉，并且设法提高出口海产品的质量，以便今后出口更多更好的海产品。
