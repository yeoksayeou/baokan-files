Dear comrades!

    On the occasion of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, please allow me, on behalf of the Central Committee of the People's Party of Iran, all party members, and the people of all ethnic groups in Iran, to extend our most sincere congratulations to you, the builders of New China, and through you, to the great Chinese people.

    Under the leadership of the glorious Communist Party of China, 600 million Chinese people have freed themselves from the enslavement of imperialism and reactionary forces. The Chinese people, who have been enslaved for many centuries, have finally gained freedom and independence. The heroic struggle of the great Chinese people has written the most glorious page in the history of the national liberation movements of colonial and dependent countries. The Communist Party of China has realized the instructions of the great Lenin to the communists of Eastern countries in 1919, and has creatively realized and developed Marxism-Leninism in China.

    All people who have been ravaged by foreign aggressors and domestic reactionaries can learn from the example of the Chinese people in striving for victory. The revolution completed in semi-colonial and semi-feudal China is a brilliant example for countries similar to China. The Communist Party of China and its outstanding leaders have built the theory of the Chinese revolution on a solid foundation of Marxism-Leninism, and have shared their rich experience with the national liberation movements of all enslaved countries. Our Iranian national liberation movement draws strength from the extensive study of the theory of the Chinese revolution, the study of the works of Comrade Mao Zedong and other outstanding leaders of the Communist Party of China, and the use of the rich experience of the Communist Party of China.

    At present, our country's national liberation movement is in a difficult period. We have personally experienced the indescribable difficulties you once encountered, and how you overcame numerous difficulties to lead the great Chinese people to victory.

    After the Kuomintang betrayed the revolution in 1927, as Comrade Mao Zedong said, the Chinese communists rose from the underground, wiped the blood from their bodies, buried the bodies of their comrades, and continued to fight. Our situation today is very similar to yours at that time. In the flames of struggle, we lost many excellent cadres; the Iranian reactionaries shot dozens of Iranian patriots whose only fault was that they opposed imperialism; many lost their lives under severe torture; and thousands of our country's outstanding sons were thrown into prison.

    It has been three years since the August 1953 coup. Supported by the most reactionary forces in the ruling clique, imperialism overthrew the legal government of Dr. Mossadegh, which relied on the broad masses of the Iranian people, and trampled on the achievements we had won with great sacrifice; our country's oil was once again handed over to foreign monopoly organizations, but under even harsher conditions than before; our country was dragged into the Baghdad Pact, which can be called the shackles of all ethnic groups. The Iranian people do not recognize these enslaving documents that sacrifice Iran's oil resources for the sake of greedy European and American monopoly capitalists, and believe that these documents are nothing more than a scrap of paper.

    Our country shares a border of more than 2,500 kilometers with the Soviet Union. Historical, traditional, economic, and political ties link us to the first socialist country. Historical necessity requires us to establish the most friendly relations with this country, which has always defended our country's freedom and independence. We should make the fullest use of the favorable conditions provided by Iranian-Soviet peaceful coexistence to strengthen the foundation of our country's independence and economic development. However, the Iranian government, instructed by American and British imperialists, disregards the expectations of the Iranian people and is unwilling to utilize our peaceful and friendly relations with the Soviet Union.

    The Iranian government's foreign policy is increasingly dictated by imperialist countries, which is the result of our country's economic policy. For this reason, although the Iranian representative also signed the Bandung Conference declaration, Iran still pursues a policy of following the adventurous course of the imperialists. Despite the Iranian people's love for the People's Republic of China and their general hatred for Chiang Kai-shek, the running dog of the US dollar, the Tehran authorities still retain Chiang Kai-shek's representative. Iranian representatives in London and Cairo are still shamelessly promoting and defending Dulles' plan to re-establish imperialist control over the Suez Canal. This is the fundamental difference between the Iranian government and its representatives and the Iranian people, because the Iranian people wholeheartedly support the just struggle of the Egyptian people.

    The domestic and foreign policies pursued by Iran's current rulers are increasingly arousing the hatred and protests of the broad masses of the Iranian people, and popular dissatisfaction is growing. It is very clear that despite the temporary superficial victory of the reactionaries, all signs indicate that the people's movement will rise even higher.

    Now, our party is healing its wounds, re-evaluating the past based on the Marxist-Leninist worldview, learning from past mistakes, and clearing the way for itself. In this regard, the experience of China's great revolutionary movement is very valuable to us.

    Our party is fighting to consolidate the unity of our country's working class, for the close alliance of workers and peasants, and for the establishment of a united front of all anti-imperialist forces, including workers, peasants, and the national bourgeoisie. Our party calls on everyone to fight to restore the freedoms won by the people of all ethnic groups in Iran and written into the constitution, to abolish enslaving treaties, and to break away from the oppression of imperialism and reactionaries.

    Only when we utilize the valuable instructions of the 20th Congress of the CPSU and the 8th National Congress of the CPC and combine the principle of Marxism-Leninism with revolutionary flexibility can the above goals be achieved.

    Before us lies a difficult road full of thorns. But we are deeply convinced that the future belongs to us, because truth and the people are on our side. We are deeply convinced that in this struggle we will receive the moral support of progressive mankind, led by the Soviet Union, and that the great People's China is the most powerful pillar.

    Long live the glorious Communist Party of China and the Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong!

    Long live the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China!

    Long live the friendship between the Chinese and Iranian people!

    The struggle of the people of all countries for peace, democracy, and socialism will surely triumph! The struggle of the people of colonial and dependent countries to break away from imperialist enslavement will surely triumph!

### 伊朗人民党代表团团长拉德马内什同志致词

    伊朗人民党代表团团长拉德马内什同志致词亲爱的同志们！
    值此中国共产党举行第八次代表大会之际，请允许我代表伊朗人民党中央委员会、全体党员和伊朗各族人民，向你们新中国的建设者，并通过你们向伟大的中国人民，致以最衷心的祝贺。
    在光荣的中国共产党领导下，六亿中国人民摆脱了帝国主义和反动势力的奴役，许多世纪以来遭受奴役的中国人民，终于得到了自由和独立。伟大中国人民的英勇斗争在殖民地和附属国人民解放运动的史册中写下了最光辉的一页。中国共产党实现了伟大列宁在一九一九年给东方各国共产党人的指示，在中国创造性地实现和发展了马克思列宁主义。
    一切遭受外国侵略者和本国反动派蹂躏的人民，都可以学习中国人民争取胜利的榜样。半殖民地半封建的中国所完成的革命，是那些与中国相似的国家的光辉范例。中国共产党和它的卓越领导者把中国革命的理论建筑在坚实的马克思列宁主义基础上，把自己的全部经验交给各被奴役国家的民族解放运动。我们伊朗的民族解放运动就是从广泛地研究中国革命理论、研究毛泽东同志和中国共产党其他卓越领导者的著作以及利用中国共产党的丰富经验中吸取力量的。
    目前我国的民族解放运动正处在艰难的时期。我们亲自体会到，你们曾经遭到多么难以形容的困难，你们怎样克服了重重困难，领导伟大的中国人民取得了胜利。
    一九二七年，国民党叛变革命以后，正像毛泽东同志所说的，中国共产党人从地下爬起来，擦干净身上的血迹，掩埋好同伴的尸体，他们又继续战斗了。我们今天的处境和你们当时的情况很相像。我们在斗争的烈火中损失了许多优秀的干部；伊朗的反动派枪杀了几十个伊朗的爱国志士，而这些爱国志士的过错就是他们反对帝国主义；许多人在严刑拷打下丧失了生命；我们祖国数以千计的优秀儿子被投进了牢狱。
    一九五三年八月政变到现在已经三年了。帝国主义在统治集团中最反动的势力的支持下，推翻了依靠伊朗广大群众的摩萨台博士的合法政府，对我们用巨大牺牲争得的成果横加蹂躏；我国的石油又交给了外国垄断组织，但条件比从前更加苛刻；我们的国家被拖入了可以称为各族人民的枷锁的巴格达条约。伊朗人民不承认这些为了贪婪的欧美垄断资本家而牺牲伊朗的石油富源的奴役性文件，认为这些文件不过是一纸空文。
    我们国家同苏联接壤的国境线长达两千五百多公里。历史的、传统的、经济的和政治的联系把我们同第一个社会主义国家联结起来。历史必然性要求我们跟这个始终维护我国的自由和独立的国家建立最友好的关系。我们应当最充分地利用伊苏和平共处所提供的有利条件，以加强我们祖国的独立和经济发展的基础。然而，受美英帝国主义者指使的伊朗政府却不顾伊朗人民的期望，不愿意利用我们同苏联之间的爱好和平的友好的关系。
    伊朗政府的对外政策日益听命于帝国主义国家，这是我国经济政策的结果。由于这个缘故，虽然伊朗代表也在万隆会议的宣言上签了字，但伊朗仍旧实行着追随帝国主义者的冒险方针的政策。尽管伊朗人民对中华人民共和国怀着热爱，对美元的走狗蒋介石普遍怀着憎恨，但德黑兰当局仍旧保留着蒋介石的代表。伊朗代表在伦敦和开罗仍然无耻地宣扬和维护杜勒斯企图再度建立帝国主义者对苏伊士运河的统治的计划。这就是伊朗政府及其代表同伊朗人民之间的根本差别，因为伊朗人民是衷心支持埃及人民的正义斗争的。
    伊朗现时的统治者所实行的对内对外政策，日益引起伊朗广大人民群众的憎恨和抗议，人民的不满情绪日益增长。十分明显，尽管反动派暂时取得表面的胜利，但是种种迹象表明，人民运动将更加高涨。
    现在，我们党正在医治自己的创伤，根据马克思列宁主义世界观来重新估价过去，从过去的错误中吸取教训，给自己扫清道路。在这方面，中国的伟大革命运动的经验，对我们是很宝贵的。
    我们党正在为巩固我们全国工人阶级的团结，为工人和农民的紧密联盟而斗争，为建立一个包括工人农民以及民族资产阶级在内的、一切反帝国主义力量的统一战线而斗争。我们党要求每个人为恢复伊朗各族人民所争得的并已写在宪法上的自由，为废除奴役性条约，摆脱帝国主义和反动派的压迫而斗争。
    只有在我们利用苏共第二十次代表大会和中共第八次代表大会的各项宝贵指示、把马克思列宁主义的原则性同革命的灵活性结合起来以后，上面这些目的才能达到。
    我们面前是一条满布荆棘的艰难道路。但我们深信，未来一定属于我们，因为真理和人民在我们这一边。我们深信，在这个斗争中我们将得到以苏联为首的进步人类在道义上的支持，伟大的人民中国是一个最有力的支柱。
    光荣的中国共产党和以毛泽东同志为首的中央委员会万岁！
    中国共产党第八次代表大会万岁！
    中伊两国人民的友谊万岁！
    世界各国人民争取和平、民主和社会主义的斗争一定胜利！殖民地和附属国人民摆脱帝国主义奴役的斗争一定胜利！（附图片）
