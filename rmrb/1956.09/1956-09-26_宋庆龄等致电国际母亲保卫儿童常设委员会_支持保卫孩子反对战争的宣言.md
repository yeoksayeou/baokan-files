Xinhua News Agency, September 25th. Soong Ching-ling sent a telegram to the International Committee for the Defense of Mothers and Children in mid-September, expressing support for the "Declaration of Mothers Defending Children Against the Dangers of War" passed at the committee's first meeting.

The telegram stated: "I fully agree with and support the views and appeals in the 'Declaration of Mothers Defending Children Against the Dangers of War.' We are at a time when the international peace movement is moving forward, and war still threatens the world, especially the recent tests of devastating weapons and the military intimidation of Egypt by Britain, France, and other countries. We are already faced with this choice: peaceful coexistence among all countries in the world, allowing atomic energy to serve peace, and allowing humanity to enter an era of unprecedented prosperity and happiness, or allowing war to destroy all of humanity? Politicians should not lack the common sense and wisdom of ordinary mothers. Let all people—regardless of race, religion, belief, country, or political and economic system—listen to the voice of the givers of life, the mothers! Support the mothers' declaration! Peace must be guaranteed, and peace will surely triumph!"

He Xiangning, Cai Chang, Deng Yingchao, Li Dequan, Xu Guangping, Shi Liang, Zhang Yun, Lin Qiaozhi, and Xie Bingxin also sent telegrams or letters to the International Committee for the Defense of Mothers and Children, respectively, expressing their support for the declaration.

In addition, the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, the Chinese Women's Association, the National Association of the Young Women's Christian Association of China, the National Association of the Women's Christian Temperance Union of China, and the Chinese People's National Committee for the Defence of Children, five organizations, also sent letters expressing their support, and called on women's and children's organizations in various countries to unite widely and strive to achieve the goals and requirements of the "Declaration."

    宋庆龄等致电国际母亲保卫儿童常设委员会
    支持保卫孩子反对战争的宣言
    新华社25日讯　宋庆龄在9月中旬致电国际母亲保卫儿童常设委员会，对这个委员会第一届会议上所通过的“母亲们保卫孩子反对战争危险的宣言”表示支持。
    电文中说：“我完全赞同和支持‘母亲们保卫孩子反对战争危险的宣言’中的观点和号召。我们正处在这样一个时期：国际和平运动正在向前发展，而战争仍然威胁着世界，特别是近来的毁灭性武器的试验和英、法等国对埃及的军事恫吓。我们已经面临着这样的抉择：世界各国和平共处，让原子能为和平服务，使人类进入一个空前繁荣幸福的时代呢，还是让战争来毁灭全人类？政治家们不应该比普通母亲们缺乏常识和智慧。所有的人——不分种族、宗教、信仰、国家和政治经济制度，都来倾听生命的给予者，母亲们的声音吧！都来支持母亲们的宣言吧！和平必须得到保证，和平一定能胜利！”
    何香凝、蔡畅、邓颖超、李德全、许广平、史良、章蕴、林巧稚和谢冰心等也曾经分别打电报或写信给国际母亲保卫儿童常设委员会对这项宣言表示支持。
    此外，中华全国民主妇女联合会、中国妇女联谊会、中华基督教女青年会全国协会、中华妇女节制会全国总会以及中国人民保卫儿童全国委员会五个团体也曾去信表示支持，并且号召各国妇女儿童组织广泛团结起来，为实现“宣言”的目标和要求而奋斗。
