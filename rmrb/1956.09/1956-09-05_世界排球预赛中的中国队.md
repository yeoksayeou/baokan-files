    Last year, the Chinese Art Troupe brought the ancient and beautiful art of the Orient to Paris, and its wonderful performances touched the hearts of Parisians. Now, young Chinese men's and women's volleyball players have come here. This is their first time participating in the World Volleyball Championship and their first time in Paris. However, on the second day after the start of the competition, the Chinese athletes have already left a good impression on the audience. The Chinese volleyball team's fast tactics have aroused great interest from teams of many countries and the Parisian audience.
    In the preliminary round on August 31, the Chinese team met the Brazilian team. The match was held at 9:30 p.m., but by 8:00 p.m., the stands were already full of spectators. Before this, both the Chinese and Brazilian teams had defeated the Indian team, so this was a battle for the finals qualification. Before the match, the Paris newspapers said, "The Brazilian team is a two-time South American champion with a high level of technical skill, and the Chinese team is also very strong. It is difficult to estimate who will win."
    At the beginning of the match, both sides entered a seesaw state. The Brazilian team played fast and defended bravely, but the Chinese team adopted a variety of tactics such as quick balls, screens, crosses, overlaps, and combined secondary feints. Team captain Jiang Zhenhong's feints repeatedly deceived the opponent's double block, Cai Qiao and Zeng Rongle's quick balls, Wu Limin's overhand spikes, Li Ce's fierce chops and dives, and Ma Junyao's spikes along the net were all excellent, so they scored continuously, winning two sets 15-10 and 15-9. In the third set, the Brazilian team's offense went more smoothly and they won 15-6. At the beginning of the fourth set, the Brazilian team once led 4-0. The two sides seesawed for a long time. The Chinese team used quick balls and net-following methods again, and took the initiative by continuously saving many dangerous balls, finally winning the fourth set 15-11. At this time, the whole audience stood up and cheered, the band played the Chinese national anthem, and the five-star red flag was raised on the flagpole. When team leader Zhang Zhihuai walked towards the stands, many spectators surrounded him, enthusiastically shook hands and embraced him, and kissed him. Many overseas Chinese students in France also ran into the stadium to shake hands and congratulate the players. They said, "The motherland has made progress so quickly in the past few years. This game has added great glory to us." Many spectators reacted by saying that they had rarely seen such a wonderful volleyball game in Paris. Some people said, "Such a wonderful game should have been held at the opening ceremony."
    After the game, the referee and the Brazilian team's coach visited the Chinese team. The Brazilian team's coach said, "China and Brazil are the two fastest teams in this championship. We are very happy to be able to compete with the Chinese team and are satisfied with this game." He also exchanged experiences with the Chinese team.
    The day after the game, many French newspapers published the grand occasion of the match between the Chinese team and the Brazilian team. Some said, "The Chinese team played very steadily, with excellent skills, good jumping ability, and many fake moves, which often made the Brazilian team unable to organize effective blocking." Some said, "The Chinese volleyball team's serving power is very strong. In the game, the Chinese team completely controlled the Brazilian team." The French "L'Équipe" sports newspaper also published a half-page report on the China-Brazil game.
    In the preliminary round, the Chinese women's team was in the same group as Poland, Austria, and West Germany. The Chinese team first defeated Austria 3-0 on August 30. On the evening of the 31st, they met the defending runner-up Polish team. In the game, the Chinese team adopted tactics such as powerful serves and tight blocking, but the Polish team was physically stronger, and finally won 3-1 against the Chinese team. On September 1, the Chinese women's team defeated the West German team with a 3-0 absolute advantage, winning the second place in the group and thus obtaining the final qualification for the top ten. After the game, the Chinese national anthem resounded through the Coubertin Stadium, the whole audience stood up, captain Zhang Guizhen raised the Chinese national flag, and the audience sent the Chinese women's team out of the stadium with warm applause.

    世界排球预赛中的中国队
    去年，中国艺术团带着东方古老优美的艺术来到了巴黎，它的精彩的表演曾经打动了巴黎人的心。现在，年轻的中国男女排球运动员又来到了这里，他们是第一次参加世界排球锦标赛，也是第一次来到巴黎的。可是，在比赛开始后的第二天，中国运动员已经给观众留下了良好的印象。中国排球队的快速战术引起了许多国家的球队和巴黎观众的巨大的兴趣。
    8月31日预赛中，中国队遇巴西队。比赛在晚上九时半举行，但是，到八点多钟，观众就已经挤满了看台。在这以前，中国队和巴西队都战胜了印度队，所以这是一场决赛权的争夺战。比赛前巴黎的报纸说，“巴西队是两届南美冠军，技术水平很高，中国队实力也很强，很难估计谁能够胜利”。
    比赛一开始，双方就进入拉锯状态，巴西队打得很快，防守也勇敢，但是中国队采用了快球、掩护、交叉、重叠、结合二次幌传的多样性战术。队长江振洪的幌传屡次骗过了对方的双人搁网，蔡翘、曾荣乐的快球，伍理民的超手扣球，李策大的猛劈和鱼跃，马俊耀的沿网扣球都很出色，因此连续得分，以15∶10，15∶9胜了两局，第三局巴西队进攻得比较顺利，以15∶6获胜。第四局开始巴西队曾经以4∶0领先，双方拉锯很久，中国队又用快球和沿网的办法，并且连续救起许多险球而取得主动权，最后以15∶11胜第四局。这时全场起立欢呼，乐队奏起中国国歌，旗杆上飘起五星红旗。当领队张之槐走向看台的时候，许多观众围住他，热烈地同他握手拥抱和亲他。许多留法华侨也都跑进球场同球员握手祝贺。他们说，“祖国这几年进步的真是太快了。这场比赛给我们增了很大的光”。许多观众反应说，在巴黎很少看到这样精采的排球赛。有的人说，“这样精采的球应该放在开幕式上进行。”
    球赛后，裁判员和巴西队指导都访问了中国队。巴西队的指导说，“中国和巴西是这次锦标赛中速度最快的两个球队，我们能够和中国队比赛感到非常高兴，对这场比赛感到满意”。他还同中国队交流了经验。
    比赛后第二天，法国许多报纸都刊载了中国队和巴西队比赛的盛况，有的说，“中国队打得很稳，技巧非常出色，队员弹跳力好，假动作多，以致往往使巴西队不能组织有效的拦网”。有的说，“中国排球队发球的力量很大，在球赛中，中国队全部控制了巴西队”。法国“勒基特”体育报还以半版篇幅登载了中巴球赛的情况。
    中国女子队在预赛中和波、奥、西德分在一组。中国队在8月30日首先以3∶0战胜奥地利队，31日晚上遇到了上届亚军波兰队。在比赛中，中国队采用了大力发球和严密拦网等战术，但是波兰队体力较强，最后以3∶1胜中国队。9月1日，中国女子队以3∶0的绝对优势击败西德队，取得了小组亚军，从而获得前十名的决赛权。球赛结束后，顾拜旦球场响起了中国国歌，全场起立，队长张桂珍升起中国国旗，观众用热烈的掌声把中国女子队送出球场。
