Xinhua News Agency, September 13th: Tokyo News – The Japanese Socialist Party issued a statement today, advocating sending a new plenipotentiary delegation to the Soviet Union to immediately reopen Soviet-Japanese negotiations and to quickly reach an agreement.

The Socialist Party's statement was issued after a meeting of the Central Executive Committee this afternoon. The statement said that the Socialist Party believes that Soviet-Japanese negotiations should have reached an agreement in the form of a peace treaty, but the current domestic and international situation does not allow this. Therefore, as an expedient measure, the Socialist Party advocates adopting a temporary agreement method to restore Soviet-Japanese diplomatic relations.

The Socialist Party listed the clauses that need to be determined in the temporary agreement, including: ending the state of war, restoring diplomatic relations (mutual dispatch of ambassadors), repatriating those detained in the Soviet Union, enabling the Soviet-Japanese Fisheries Treaty to take effect, and Soviet support for Japan's accession to the United Nations.

Xinhua News Agency, September 13th: Tokyo News – The Japanese Foreign Ministry and the U.S. State Department simultaneously released this morning the U.S. State Department's memorandum to Japan, openly interfering in Soviet-Japanese negotiations.

In the memorandum, the U.S. State Department threatened Japan not to recognize Soviet territorial sovereignty over southern Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands. It said, "Japan has no right to transfer the territorial sovereignty it declared abandoned in the San Francisco Peace Treaty to others." The United States believes that "this issue awaits international solutions to be taken outside of this treaty."

The U.S. State Department also openly denied the legal effect of the Yalta Agreement, which stipulated that southern Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands be handed over to the Soviet Union.

At the same time, the United States also described Etorofu and Kunashiri Islands, as well as the Habomai Islands and Shikotan Island, which belong to the Soviet Union, as "having always been part of Japan's inherent territory and should be recognized as legitimate territory under Japanese sovereignty."

The U.S. State Department threatened Japan that if Japan recognizes Soviet territorial sovereignty over southern Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands, "in the opinion of the United States," "it cannot bind the signatories of the San Francisco Peace Treaty, and it is estimated that the treaty signatories will reserve all the rights stipulated in this treaty."

    日本社会党要求
    立刻重开日苏谈判并达成协议
    美国公然威胁日本破坏日苏谈判
    据新华社13日讯　东京消息：日本社会党今天发表声明，主张派遣新的全权代表团访问苏联，立刻重开日苏谈判，并且迅速使谈判达成协议。
    社会党的这个声明是经过中央执行委员会今天下午召开的会议讨论后发表的。声明说，社会党认为日苏谈判本来应该以缔结和约的方式达成协议，但是，目前的国内外形势不允许这样做。因此，作为权宜措施，社会党主张采取临时协定方式，恢复日苏邦交。
    社会党列举需要在临时协定中决定的条款包括：结束战争状态，恢复外交关系（互派大使），遣返被拘留在苏联的人员，使日苏渔业条约生效，苏联支持日本加入联合国。
    据新华社13日讯　东京消息：日本外务省和美国国务院今天早晨同时发表了美国国务院给日本的公然干预苏日谈判的备忘录。
    美国国务院在备忘录中威胁日本不得承认苏联对库页岛南部和千岛群岛的领土主权。它说，“日本是没有权利把它在旧金山和约上声明放弃的领土主权移交给别人的。”美国认为，“这个问题，有待于采取这个条约以外的国际解决手段加以解决。”
    美国国务院还公然否认规定库页岛南部和千岛群岛交给苏联的雅尔塔协定的法律效果。
    同时，美国还在备忘录中把属于苏联的择捉和国后两岛以及齿舞群岛和色丹岛，说成是“一直是构成日本固有领土的一部分，并且应当作为日本国主权下的合法领土加以承认”。
    美国国务院威胁日本说，如果日本承认苏联对库页岛南部和千岛群岛的领土主权，“根据美国的见解”，“它不能约束旧金山和约的签字国，同时，估计条约签字国大约会保留这项条约所规定的一切权利”。
