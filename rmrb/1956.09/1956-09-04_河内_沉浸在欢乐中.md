Hanoi—Immersed in Joy
By Our Correspondent in Vietnam, Zhan Chao

　　The hands of the clock had just struck four, and the sky was still dark, but the surroundings were already boiling. The crisp sound of copper whistles, the sound of neat footsteps, the loud singing, the excited chatter, the heart-stirring sound of gongs and drums, all intertwined into a huge wave of joyful sound, rushing through the streets.

　　In the dark windows of many houses in the distance and near, the lights suddenly lit up. Countless red flags with gold stars hanging in front of the doors can be seen fluttering in the wind.

　　Our neighbors, three generations of grandparents and grandchildren, sat around the calendar, and the old patriarch turned a new page and solemnly announced that the National Day of September 2, 1956, had arrived.

　　The sky gradually brightened.

　　Ba Dinh Square clearly appeared in front of people, it was so wide, open, solemn and beautiful.

　　The crowds, who had long gathered from all directions around Ba Dinh Square and were dressed in festive costumes, looked like countless flowers blooming on the lawns and in the groves beside the square, outlining an extraordinary scene in the morning light.

　　In the center of Ba Dinh Square, on the tall review stand with its national characteristics, eight red Arabic numerals were inlaid on both sides of the portrait of President Ho Chi Minh: 1945-1956. These simple symbols contain such great significance. Eleven years ago, on September 2, 1945, President Ho Chi Minh solemnly declared the independence of the Vietnamese nation to the world in this very place. After enduring more than 80 years of brutal rule by French colonialism and armed aggression by Japanese militarism, the Vietnamese people finally won the victory of the "August Revolution" under the leadership of the Indochinese Communist Party, the predecessor of the Vietnam Workers' Party, and established their own independent country. This was a major event that turned the world upside down. More than 500,000 people who listened to President Ho Chi Minh's "Declaration of Independence" were moved to tears. On January 1, 1955, after winning the great victory of the War of Resistance, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and President Ho Chi Minh held a grand ceremony here to return the capital to Hanoi. Today, the Vietnamese people will once again demonstrate their firm will and strength to defend peace, build the North, and strive for national reunification.

　　At exactly 8:00 a.m., President Ho Chi Minh and many leaders of the Vietnam Workers' Party and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam ascended the review stand, and the grand parade celebrating the "September 2nd" National Day in Hanoi began.

　　Amidst the majestic military music, the heroic Vietnamese People's Army held a parade and solemnly marched past Ba Dinh Square. This is the army of the sons and daughters of the Vietnamese people. When it swore its establishment on a high mountain in North Vietnam on December 23, 1944, it had a total of only thirty-four people and as many rifles; by the time of the August Revolution, it was only over two thousand people; and now it is already a powerful people's armed force with various arms of the service, famous throughout the world for the Dien Bien Phu campaign. In order to ease international tensions and for the reunification of the motherland, the Vietnamese People's Army voluntarily demobilized more than 80,000 people in June this year. These demobilized soldiers have now taken up various construction posts.

　　A burst of applause resounded through Ba Dinh Square as people warmly welcomed the heroic troops.

　　Subsequently, a mighty mass parade passed through Ba Dinh Square. The honor guard composed of workers walked at the front. Immediately following were two young drivers driving two small cars decorated with the words "9-2", lightly speeding across the square. Innocent and lively children stopped in front of the review stand, cheering and jumping for joy, waving bouquets, and releasing the balloons in their hands into the high sky. Then came workers, farmers, intellectuals, Southern representatives, ethnic minorities, overseas Chinese, industrialists and businessmen, religious figures, women, youth, students, citizens... An endless stream of people flowed through Ba Dinh Square like a torrent, carrying huge models, reporting on the specific achievements of the two years of peaceful recovery and construction. It is enough to record these figures: in 1955, industrial output increased seven times compared to 1954, and in the first half of 1956 it increased three times compared to the entire year of 1955; the summer rice harvest in 1956 increased by 40% compared to 1955, exceeding the highest pre-war level; by the first half of 1956, a total of 650 kilometers of railways had been restored to traffic, and through traffic and joint transportation with China, the Soviet Union, and many socialist countries had created very favorable conditions for Vietnam's peaceful recovery and construction.

　　The parade lasted for a full three hours, and the last to arrive at Ba Dinh Square were thousands of people from the sports team and the literary and art team. On the basis of restoring and building the economy, the Vietnamese people have been able to greatly develop mass sports and cultural activities.

　　The parade ended, and the crowds around Ba Dinh Square surged like a tide to the front of the review stand, cheering for President Ho Chi Minh and the national leaders. The whole audience sang "Unity is Strength" for a long time.

　　As dusk fell, a grand celebration banquet was held in the Presidential Palace of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. National leaders and many foreign guests spent this joyful evening together. People toasted each other for the unification of Vietnam, for world peace and friendship.

　　At the Hanoi Grand Theater, Ukrainian artists held a grand opening ceremony. The wonderful performances continued until 12 o'clock late at night.

　　When people drove home, passing by Hoan Kiem Lake, the fireworks had just finished, and the tower in the center of Hoan Kiem Lake shone like a jewel under the light.

　　The capital of the Vietnamese people, Hanoi, was completely immersed in the festive atmosphere.

    河内—沉浸在欢乐中
    本报驻越南记者　展潮
    时针刚指向四点钟，天还是黑沉沉的，可是周围却已经沸腾起来了。清脆的铜哨声、整齐的步伐声、高亢的歌唱声、兴奋的谈笑声、震动心魄的锣鼓声，交炽成一片巨大的欢腾的声浪，从大街上奔流过去。
    远处和近处许多人家黑洞洞的窗户里，刹那间电灯都亮起来了。可以看得见挂在门前无数面金星红旗正迎风招展。
    我们的邻居，爷孙三辈围坐在日历旁边，由年老的家长揭开了新的一页，郑重地宣布1956年9月2日国庆节到来了。
    天色一点点的发白了。
    巴亭广场清楚地呈现在人们的面前，它是那末的宽阔、开朗、庄严和美丽。
    早就从四面八方汇集到巴亭广场周围的、穿着节日盛装的人群，像无数朵鲜花正开在广场旁边的草坪上和绿树丛中似的，在晨曦里勾划出一幅非凡的景色。
    巴亭广场正中，那座高大的、富有民族特色的检阅台上，在胡志明主席的挂像两侧，镶嵌着八个红色阿拉伯字码：1945—1956。这些简单的符号，包容着多么重大的意义呀。十一年前，1945年9月2日，胡志明主席就在这个地方向全世界庄严地宣告越南民族的独立。越南人民在经受法国殖民主义八十多年的残暴统治和日本军国主义的武装侵略之后，终于在越南劳动党的前身印度支那共产党的领导下，取得“八月革命”的胜利，建立了自己独立的国家，这是一件翻天复地的大事情。倾听胡志明主席“独立宣言”的五十多万群众，都感动得流泪了。1955年1月1日，在赢得了伟大的抗战胜利之后，越南民主共和国政府和胡志明主席在这个地方举行了隆重的还都仪式。今天，越南人民又要在这里显示自己保卫和平、建设北方、争取祖国统一的坚强意志和力量。
    上午八时正，胡志明主席和越南劳动党、越南民主共和国政府的许多领导人登上了检阅台，河内盛大的庆祝“九、二”国庆游行大会开始了。
    在雄壮的军乐声中，英雄的越南人民军举行分列式，威严地走过巴亭广场。这是越南人民的子弟兵，当它在1944年12月23日在北越一座高山上宣誓成立的时候，总共只有三十四个人和同样多的步枪；到八月革命的时候，也才不过二千多人；而现在它已经是一支以奠边府战役闻名于世的、拥有各式兵种的强大的人民武装力量了。为了缓和国际紧张局势，为了祖国的统一，越南人民军在今年六月间主动的裁减了八万多人。这些复员军人今天都已经走上了各个建设的岗位。
    巴亭广场扬起了一片掌声，人们热烈地迎送着这支英雄的部队。
    随后，浩浩荡荡的群众游行的队伍通过巴亭广场。由工人组成的仪仗大队走在最前面。紧接着是两个少年驾驶员驾驶着两辆点缀“九、二”字样的小汽车，轻巧地驰过了广场。天真活泼的少年儿童们，他们在检阅台前停下来了，尽情的欢呼跳跃，挥舞着花束，把手里的气球放到高高的空中去。接着是工人、农民、知识分子、南方代表、少数民族、华侨、工商业者、宗教界、妇女、青年、学生、市民……无穷无尽的队伍像一股巨流似的从巴亭广场流过，人们带着巨大的模型，报告两年来和平恢复建设的各项具体成绩。只要记下这些数字就够了：1955年的工业产量比1954年增加了七倍、1956年上半年比1955年全年增加了三倍；1956年夏稻收获量比1955年增加40％，超过战前最高的水平；1956年上半年已经恢复通车的铁路共达六百五十公里，并且和中国、苏联以及许多社会主义国家通车联运，为越南和平恢复建设创造了十分有利的条件。
    游行队伍整整走了三个小时，最后来到巴亭广场上的是上千人的体育大队和文艺大队。在恢复和建设经济的基础上，越南人民已经有可能大大的发展群众性的体育运动和文艺运动了。
    游行结束了，巴亭广场周围的人群潮水似的涌向检阅台前，向胡志明主席和国家的领导人欢呼。全场合唱“团结就是力量”的歌声，久久不绝。
    夜幕刚落，在越南民主共和国主席府里，举行盛大的庆祝宴会。国家领导人和许多外宾共度这个欢乐的夜晚。人们互相劝酒为越南的统一、为世界和平和友谊而干杯。
    在河内大戏院里，乌克兰的艺术家们举行了隆重的开幕仪式。精采的表演一直继续到深夜的12时。
    当人们驱车回家，走过还剑湖边的时候，焰火刚放过不久，还剑湖中央的塔在灯光的照耀下像一座宝石放出奇异的光彩。
    越南人民的首都河内整个沉浸在节日的欢乐的气氛里。
