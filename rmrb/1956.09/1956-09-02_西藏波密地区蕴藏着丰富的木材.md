    Rich Timber Resources Discovered in Bomi Region of Tibet
    (Xinhua News Agency) After surveying the Bomi region of Tibet, the Ministry of Forestry's forest survey team confirmed that the Bomi region contains rich timber resources. According to the statistics of Yigong Zong in the Bomi region alone, forests account for a quarter of the total area of the Zong. The Kangzang Highway's route through the Bomi region has almost two to three hundred kilometers passing through forests or along the edges of forest areas. According to the observation of the survey team, the average diameter of these timbers is about 46 centimeters, and there are many trees with a diameter of one meter and a height of 35 meters.
    Spruce is the most abundant tree in the Bomi region, accounting for more than 40% of the area covered by trees in the region. Spruce can be used for railway sleepers and building materials. Masson pine, Chinese white pine, larch, oriental arborvitae, poplar, and birch also grow here in large quantities. Rare red pine and lacquer trees with high economic value have also been discovered.

    西藏波密地区蕴藏着丰富的木材
    据新华社讯　林业部森林踏勘组在西藏波密地区踏勘后，证明波密地区蕴藏着丰富的木材。仅据波密地区依贡宗的统计，森林就占全宗面积的四分之一。康藏公路经过波密地区的线路，几乎有两三百公里通过森林或在森林区的边沿。据踏勘组观察，这些木材直径平均都有四十六公分左右，还有许多直径一公尺，高三十五公尺的林木。
    波密地区的林木以云杉为最多，约占全区林木面积的40％以上。云杉可做枕木和建筑材料。这里生长的马尾松、华山松、落叶松、侧松、杨树、桦树也很多。稀有的赤柏松和经济价值很高的漆树等也有发现。
