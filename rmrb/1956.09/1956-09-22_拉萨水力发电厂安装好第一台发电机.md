    Lhasa Hydroelectric Power Plant Installs First Generator
    (Xinhua News Agency) The newly built Lhasa Hydroelectric Power Plant has installed its first generator, and the water diversion canal also began trial water release on the 14th. The plant's building project has been completed 70%, and a row of tall, newly erected power poles extends from the power plant directly to the urban area, and the wiring project is about to be completed.
    These days, two thousand Tibetan and Han workers have launched intense labor to strive for early power transmission. The workers constructing the canal are working day and night in shifts, completing the canal construction ahead of schedule. Installation workers from all over the motherland began assembling and installing the plant's machinery and equipment as soon as it arrived. A few days ago, they also formed a youth commando team to rush the installation of the pressure steel pipes, which would normally take two months, in twenty days.

    拉萨水力发电厂安装好第一台发电机
    据新华社讯　新建的拉萨水力发电厂安装好了第一台发电机，引水渠道也在14日开始试行放水。这个发电厂的厂房工程已完成了70％，新树立起来的一排高大的电杆从电厂直通向市区，架线的工程即将完成。
    这些天，两千名的藏汉族工人为争取提早送电，展开了紧张劳动。修筑渠道的工人日夜轮班施工，提前完成渠道的修建。从祖国各地来的安装工人，当电厂机器设备一运到时，便动手组合安装。几天前他们又成立了青年突击队，要把两个月才能安装起来的压力钢管，在二十天内突击安装好。
