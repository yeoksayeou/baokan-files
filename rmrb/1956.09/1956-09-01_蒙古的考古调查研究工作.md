    Since the establishment of the Mongolian People's Republic, Mongolian archaeologists and historians have made great achievements in archaeological survey and research.

    From 1924 to 1926, the first large-scale archaeological survey work was carried out. In addition to archaeologists, historians also participated in this survey. They investigated the tombs of the Xiongnu nobles in the Noyon Uul Mountains. The cultural relics discovered in this survey are of great significance for studying the social system and cultural development of the Xiongnu.

    From 1948 to 1949, another national archaeological survey was conducted. This archaeological survey studied the Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age, and also investigated the Turkic tombs, the ruins of the Uyghur's Khara-Balgasun and the Mongol's Karakorum. The survey results proved that humans inhabited the territory of Mongolia as early as the Neolithic Age. In the Stone Age and Bronze Age, Mongolia had close ties with North China, Northeast China, and South and East Siberia. In addition, cities such as Khara-Balgasun and Karakorum were not only the political centers of the time, but also the centers of handicrafts, commerce, and culture. From 1954 to 1955, Ts. Dorjisuren excavated the tombs of the Xiongnu in the Noyon Uul Mountains and other places, further clarifying some issues of the social life and customs of the Xiongnu. The discovered ironware once again proved the close historical relationship between Mongolia and China. Some cultural relics were also found in some tombs, which were very similar to those found in North and Northeast China, but not in Altai and Siberia. From 1950 to 1955, Kh. Perlee newly discovered the ruins of more than ten cities of the Xiongnu, Uyghur, Khitan, and Mongol peoples. This discovery confirmed that although the various tribes that once lived on the territory of Mongolia lived by animal husbandry, they already had cities since the Xiongnu era.

    From 1953 to 1954, O. Namnandorj discovered a memorial stele of Möngke Khan near Khuvsgul aimag. The stele was inscribed in Mongolian and Chinese, and it was built during Möngke Khan's lifetime (1257). City ruins were also discovered at the location of this stele. This may be the place where Möngke Khan was located. In 1955, Mongolian archaeologists also surveyed western Mongolia and discovered steles inscribed with Turkic script, steles inscribed with Uyghur script, and stone walls engraved with two hundred and eighty patterns.

    This year, the survey and research will focus on the Stone Age sites in Khuvsgul aimag and the Xiongnu tombs in the Black and Khuni River basins, as well as the ruins of some Khitan and Mongol cities in the eastern region of Mongolia.

    蒙古的考古调查研究工作
    蒙古人民共和国成立以来，蒙古的考古、历史学家们在考古调查研究方面曾取得了很大的成绩。
    1924年至1926年间进行了第一次规模较大的考古调查工作。参加这次调查的，除了考古学家外，还有历史学家。他们调查了诺颜乌拉山的匈奴贵族的坟墓。在这次调查中发现的文物，对于研究匈奴的社会制度、文化发展情况，有着重要意义。
    1948年至1949年间，又进行了一次全国性的考古普查工作。这次考古调查研究了石器时代、铜器时代和铁器时代，并调查了突厥坟墓、畏兀儿的哈剌八剌合孙和蒙古的和林城市的废墟等。调查结果证明，在蒙古国土上，远在新石器时代就有人类居住。还在石器时代、铜器时代，蒙古就同中国的华北、东北以及南、东西伯利亚有着密切联系。此外，哈剌八剌合孙、和林等城市不仅是当时的政治中心，而且是手工业、商业和文化的中心点。1954年至1955年，策·多尔吉苏荣在诺颜乌拉山等地挖掘了匈奴的坟墓，进一步明确了匈奴的社会生活、风俗习惯的某些问题。发现的铁器再次证明了蒙古同中国的历史有着密切的关系。并在有些坟墓中发现了一些文物，这些文物同中国的华北、东北所发现的十分相似，而在阿尔泰、西伯利亚却是没有的。1950年至1955年间，赫·波仁来新发现了匈奴、畏兀儿、契丹、蒙古的十多个城市的废墟。这次发现证实了曾居住在蒙古国土上的各个部落虽然都以牧畜为生，但是他们从匈奴时代起就已有了城市。
    1953年至1954年间，奥·那木多尔吉在库苏古尔艾马克附近发现了蒙哥帝的纪念碑，碑上刻有蒙、汉文，它是蒙哥帝在世时（1257年）建立的。在这块碑的所在地又发现了城市废墟。这可能就是蒙哥帝所在的地方。1955年，蒙古的考古学家又调查了蒙古的西部，发现了刻有突厥文的碑、畏兀儿文的碑和刻有二百八十幅图案的石壁。
    今年，调查研究库苏古尔艾马克的石器时代遗址和黑努、胡尼两河流域的匈奴墓，以及蒙古东部地区的契丹、蒙古部分城市的废墟等。
