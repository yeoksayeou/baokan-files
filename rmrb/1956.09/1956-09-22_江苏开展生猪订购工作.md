Xinhua News Agency: In order to support the development of farmers' pig raising as a sideline, the Jiangsu Provincial Company of the China National Foodstuffs Corporation has recently issued 5 million yuan in advance payments for hog orders and has obtained 130 million jin of feed grain from the national grain departments to order hogs from farmers. Since August, farmers in Taixing, Siyang, and Dongtai counties, which are key pig-producing areas, have pre-sold nearly 200,000 hogs to the state.

The province's hog purchasing price has also been adjusted, with an average increase of more than 3% compared to the past. Farmers are satisfied with the purchase price. In the past two months, the number of hogs sold by farmers to the state throughout the province has increased by more than 20% compared to the same period last year.
