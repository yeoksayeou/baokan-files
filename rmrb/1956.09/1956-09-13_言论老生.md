"Old Rhetoric"
		Tang Tao

	In the early years of the Republic of China, a type of spoken drama was popular in Shanghai, which everyone called "Civilized Drama." In "Civilized Drama" there was a type of character who specialized in playing upright figures, whose forte was delivering pronouncements. Once on stage, they spoke fluent "Mandarin," always delivering a long and extensive speech. Sometimes it was "stern and severe," sometimes it was "tearful and emotional," although the content was empty, it certainly trotted out a lot of grand principles, achieving the level of impassioned rhetoric. This type of character, like the Peking opera roles of "long-bearded male role", "short-attired male role", "boudoir maiden", and "female warrior," had a specific title earned because of it, called: "Old Rhetoric."
	His specialty was empty talk: peddling dogma.
	Now, "Civilized Drama" has long disappeared, but "Old Rhetoric" still remains in our lives. Of course, this does not refer to newspaper editors or university professors; there is nothing wrong with "rhetoric" as a profession in itself. The problem lies in the content of their "rhetoric," which is the key to whether they become "Old Rhetoric." The so-called "Old Rhetoric" has at least two books in their belly: one is a "Book of Morality," and the other is a "Chinese Grammar." These are not specialized works by Lao Tzu or anyone else, but rather a synthesis of famous sayings from ancient and modern times, both Chinese and foreign, which have been subjectively modified by the gentleman himself. In the eyes of "Old Rhetoric," these two books are "applicable everywhere," the standard for evaluating people and articles at any time and any place. Therefore, if they don't have a chance to speak, then fine, but once they open their mouths, they always quote "scriptures" and cite "authorities."
	When they need to say a few words about personnel matters, they bring their "Book of Morality." If young people have their own hobbies and ideals, and devote themselves to studying in their spare time, he flips through the "Book of Morality" and says: "This is a fame-seeking mentality, individualism!" If teachers ask to overcome the chaos and take care of their children at home, he flips through the "Book of Morality" and says: "This is a family concept, anti-collective spirit!" When he sees someone delving into their profession or talking about love, his "Book of Morality" has a passage like this: "Divorced from politics, lacking socialist enthusiasm!"
	When they need to express opinions on articles, they bring their "Chinese Grammar." Seeing a novel describing the thoughts and lives of soldiers, he flips through the "Chinese Grammar" and says: "Is this what our People's Liberation Army is really like?" Seeing a short piece depicting industrial production, he flips through the "Chinese Grammar" and says: "There is no mention of the Party's leadership; doesn't our Party lead industrial production?" Sometimes when he sees a sketch or a short poem, his "Chinese Grammar" grandly states: "It does not reflect the essence of a certain social force!"
	Life is complex; what if the answers cannot be found in his "Book of Morality" and "Chinese Grammar"? There is also a rule here: Anything for which there are no "scriptures" or "authorities" to cite is absolutely unacceptable! This is called: lacking "theoretical" basis.
	As a characteristic of "Old Rhetoric," what he publishes is always irrefutable, eternally correct grand principles, with just one point: it is divorced from reality. But what does it matter if it is divorced from reality! What he talks about is not reality but "rhetoric." To demand reality from "rhetoric" is not also to be divorced from reality—the reality of his "rhetoric"? After all is said and done, our "Old Rhetoric" is ultimately a "victor"!
	This is why "Civilized Drama" had to hire "Old Rhetoric" at great expense.
	Unfortunately, people are clear in their minds that they are watching a play, and once they return to life, they quickly forget his "rhetoric," because life is always concrete and practical. To stand invincible on lofty "rhetoric," only to be smashed to pieces in real life, is a lesson for all dogmatism and subjectivism, and cannot but be the tragedy of "Old Rhetoric."

### “言论老生”

    “言论老生”
    唐弢
    民国初年，上海曾经流行过一种话剧，大家叫它做“文明戏”。“文明戏”里有种专演正派人物的角色，他的擅长是发议论，上得台来，满口“官话”，总是长长的一大篇。有时候是“声色俱厉”，有时候是“声泪俱下”，虽然内容空泛，却的确搬出许多大道理，做到了慷慨陈词的地步。这种角色，也像京戏里的“长靠”、“短打”、“闺门旦”、“刀马旦”一样，有一个因此而获得的专称，叫做：“言论老生”。
    他的拿手戏就是空口说白话：贩卖教条。
    现在，“文明戏”早已绝迹，“言论老生”却还留在我们的生活里。自然，这指的并不是报馆主笔，讲坛教授，以“言论”为职业本来没有什么可以非难，问题还在于他的“言论”的内容，这是是否成为“老生”的关键。所谓“言论老生”也者，他的肚里至少有两部书：一部“道德经”，一部“汉文典”，并非老子或者什么人的专著，而是综合古今中外的名人名言，但又的确通过了他先生主观的自己的大作。在“言论老生”看来，这两部书是“放诸四海而皆准”，任何时候，任何地点的衡人论文的标准，因此，没有机会开口则已，一开口，他总在引“经”据“典”。
    碰到要对人事说几句话了，他就带着他的“道德经”。青年们有自己的爱好和理想，在业余专心研究，他翻一下“道德经”说道：“这是成名思想，个人主义！”教员们要求克服忙乱现象，照顾照顾家里的孩子，他翻一下“道德经”，说道：“这是家庭观念，反集体精神！”看见有人在钻业务，谈爱情，他的“道德经”里便有这样的一条：“脱离政治，缺乏社会主义热情！”
    碰到要对文章发表意见了，他就带着他的“汉文典”。看到一篇描写战士思想生活的小说，他翻一下“汉文典”，说道：“难道我们的解放军是这样的吗？”看到一篇刻划工业生产的短篇，他翻一下“汉文典”，说道：“没有写党的领导，难道我们的党不在领导工业生产吗？”有时候看到的是一段速写，一首小诗，他的“汉文典”里则又堂皇地写着：“没有反映出一定社会力量的本质！”
    生活是复杂的，如果在他的“道德经”和“汉文典”里找不到答案呢？这里也有一条：凡无“经”“典”可以援引的，一律要不得！这叫做：没有“理论”根据。
    作为“言论老生”的特征，他所发表的总是无法反驳、永远正确的大道理，就只是一点：不联系实际。但不联系实际又有什么关系呀！他谈的本来就不是实际而是“言论”，对“言论”要求实际，不也就是脱离实际——他的“言论”的实际了吗？说来说去，我们的“言论老生”最后还是一个“胜利者”！
    这就是“文明戏”为什么要重金礼聘“言论老生”的缘故。
    不幸的是：人们心里明白自己是在看戏，一回到生活，却早把他的“言论”忘的一干二净了，因为生活总是具体而实际的。在高超的“言论”上立于不败之地，一到实际生活里就碰得粉碎，这是对一切教条主义主观主义的教训，也不能不是“言论老生”的悲哀。
