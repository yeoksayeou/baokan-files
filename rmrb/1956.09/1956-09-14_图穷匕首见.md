The ambitions of the United States, Britain, and France to seize Egypt's Suez Canal have reached the stage where "the dagger is revealed when the map unrolls." They are now openly disregarding all principles of international justice and international law, and are brandishing a bloodthirsty knife at the Egyptian people.

On September 12th, British Prime Minister Eden announced in the House of Commons that the United States, Britain, and France would immediately form a so-called "Users' Association" to forcibly "take over" the management of the Suez Canal. According to a Reuters report, this "association" plan was conceived by Dulles. According to this plan, after the United States, Britain, and France order the non-Egyptian staff of the Suez Canal Company to resign, this "association" will send its own pilots to guide ships through the canal and collect canal tolls. If Egypt opposes this blatant violation of Egyptian sovereignty, the United States, Britain, and France will carry out armed intervention against Egypt.

As can be seen from French Prime Minister Mollet's speech in Paris on the same day, this provocative plan by the United States, Britain, and France is intended to hold a knife to the Egyptian people's throats to force Egypt to accept the "Dulles Plan" that has already been rejected. If this fails, they will forcibly occupy the canal in the name of canal "users." Eden has already announced in the House of Commons that this organization "will lead to a permanent agreement." This openly shows the final goal of the United States, Britain, and France.

A few days ago, the United States, Britain, and France, especially the United States, were still pretending to talk about their "respect" for Egyptian sovereignty and their "respect" for the UN Charter and international law. They had vigorously promoted that the "Dulles Plan" was very "respectful of Egyptian sovereignty." But now, after the disguise of the "Dulles Plan" was exposed by the Egyptian people, the colonialist faces of the United States, Britain, and France are exposed without a shred of disguise. They openly said to Egypt: We want to seize the Suez Canal, and if you don't give it to us, we will use force! The UN Charter and international law have now been thrown to the four winds by the United States, Britain, and France.

The intention of the United States, Britain, and France to openly rob the Suez Canal reminds people of the acts of aggression carried out by the German, Italian, and Japanese fascist axis in Europe and the Far East in the 1930s. Japan at that time invaded and occupied Northeast China, using the excuse that Northeast China was Japan's "lifeline." This is exactly the same as the excuse used by the United States, Britain, and France today to attempt to invade and occupy the Suez Canal. It is very obvious that the actions of the United States, Britain, and France today are not only a provocation to the Egyptian people, but also a provocation to the entire Arab East, the entire Asia and Africa, and all peace-loving people in the world. This arrogant conspiracy of aggression by the United States, Britain, and France has seriously poisoned the favorable atmosphere for a peaceful resolution of the Suez Canal issue and made the situation in the Middle East extremely serious.

However, while announcing the three countries' looting plan, Eden counterattacked Egypt, insisting that Egypt's righteous action of taking back its own canal was "aggression." In reality, it is Britain and the Western colonialists themselves who have been invading other people's land for decades and are still attempting to continue their aggression. He insisted that "Egypt is the one using force," but in reality, it is Britain and its American and French partners who are preparing to use force with murderous intent. He insisted that if Egypt opposes the looting plan of the United States, Britain, and France, Egypt would be considered to have "violated the 1888 Convention." Moreover, Britain and France even "accused" Nasser to the United Nations of "endangering world peace and security." Facts have proved that it is precisely the aggressive behavior of the United States, Britain, and France that has violated the 1888 Convention and brought serious harm to world peace and security. These colonialist masters of the United States, Britain, and France do not seem to have woken up from their 19th-century dream, thinking that in this world, their words are law, and that the whole world is waiting for them to point out what is black and what is white. However, the most beautiful dream is still just a dream and cannot become reality.

Listen to the voices of the British people on the streets outside the British Parliament! Listen to the voices of the indignant people of Arab countries! Listen to the voices of world public opinion! The British people, the people of Arab countries, and the people of the world all oppose war and oppose aggression. If Britain and France, with the support of the United States, attack Egypt, they will not only bear the responsibility for destroying world peace, but also suffer the bitter fruit they have sown themselves. The United States supports Britain and France in using force so that the United States can profit from it and replace Britain and France in the Middle East. The people of Britain and France are clearly aware of this.

On the Suez Canal issue, peaceful negotiations are the best policy, the use of force is the worst policy, and the attempt to openly rob the canal is the worst of the worst. The ruling groups of the United States, Britain, and France should no longer harbor any侥幸冒险 psychology. They should realize that if they dare to attack the Egyptian people, it will not only be the Egyptian people who stand up to resist them. "Those who play with fire will be burned," this is an old saying, but unfortunately, by the time many adventurers and aggressors truly understand the meaning of this sentence, it is already too late to regret it.

### 图穷匕首见

    图穷匕首见
    美、英、法三国夺取埃及的苏彝士运河的野心，已经到了“图穷匕首见”的阶段。它们现在公然不顾一切国际正义和国际法的原则，向埃及人民亮出渴血的刀子来了。
    9月12日，英国首相艾登在下院宣布，美、英、法三国将立即组成一个所谓“使用国协会”，强行“接收”苏彝士运河的管理工作。据路透社报道，这个“协会”的计划是杜勒斯想出来的。按照这个计划，在美、英、法命令苏彝士运河公司的非埃及籍工作人员离职以后，这个“协会”将派遣自己的领航员引导船只通过运河，并且征收运河通行税。如果埃及对这种粗暴侵犯埃及主权的行为表示反对，美、英、法三国就将对埃及进行武装干涉。
    从法国总理摩勒同一天在巴黎发表的演说可以看出，美、英、法的这个挑衅计划，是想用刀子搁在埃及人民的头上，来迫使埃及接受那个早已被拒绝了的“杜勒斯计划”。如果此计不成，它们就要以运河“使用国”的名义，强行占领运河。艾登在下院已经宣布，经由这种组织，“将导致永久性的协定”。这就明目张胆地表明了美、英、法的最后目的。
    几天以前，美、英、法三国，尤其是美国还在装模作样地大谈它们对埃及主权的“尊重”，大谈它们对联合国宪章和国际公法的“尊重”，它们曾经大肆宣传说，“杜勒斯计划”是非常“尊重埃及主权”的。可是现在，在“杜勒斯计划”的伪装被埃及人民揭穿以后，美、英、法三国的殖民主义面目便一丝不挂地暴露出来了。它们公开地向埃及说：我们要强占苏彝士运河，如果你不给，我们就要动武！什么联合国宪章，什么国际公法，现在都被美、英、法抛到九霄云外去了。
    美、英、法三国的这种公开劫夺苏彝士运河的打算，使人想起了本世纪三十年代德、意、日法西斯轴心在欧洲和远东进行侵略的行为。日本当时侵占中国的东北，所用的借口就是硬说中国的东北是日本的“生命线”。这同美、英、法今天企图侵占苏彝士运河的借口一模一样。十分明显，美、英、法今天的这种行动，不仅是对埃及人民的挑衅，而且是对整个阿拉伯东方、整个亚洲和非洲和全世界爱好和平的人民的挑衅。美、英、法三国这个狂妄的侵略阴谋，严重地毒化了当前和平解决苏彝士运河问题的有利气氛，而使中东局势极端严重。
    但是，艾登在宣布三国的抢劫计划的同时，却对埃及反咬一口，硬说埃及把自己的运河收回的天经地义的行动是“侵略”，实际上，侵略了他人的土地已达数十年之久，而现在仍企图继续侵略的，恰恰是英国和西方殖民主义者自己。他硬说“使用武力的是埃及”，实际上，杀气腾腾地正在准备使用武力的，恰恰是英国和它的美、法伙伴。他硬说如果埃及反对美、英、法的抢劫计划，埃及就被认为“破坏了1888年公约”。并且，英、法还居然向联合国“控诉”“纳赛尔危害世界和平与安全”。事实证明破坏1888年公约，并为世界和平与安全带来严重危害的，也恰恰是美、英、法的侵略行为。美、英、法三国的这些殖民主义老爷们似乎还没有从十九世纪的梦里醒过来，以为在这个世界上，他们的话就是法律，以为全世界都等着它们去指点什么是黑，什么是白。然而最美妙的梦毕竟只是梦，不能变成现实。
    听听在英国议会外面街道上英国人民的声音吧！听听义愤填膺的阿拉伯各国人民的声音吧！听听全世界的舆论的声音吧！英国人民、阿拉伯各国人民和全世界人民都一齐反对战争，反对侵略。如果英、法在美国支持下进攻埃及，它们不但要负起破坏世界和平的责任，而且将吃到它们自己种下的苦果。美国支持英、法使用武力，好让美国从中取利，取英、法在中东的地位而代之。英、法两国人民是清楚地知道这一点的。
    在苏彝士运河问题上，和平谈判是上策，使用武力威胁是下策，而企图公然劫夺运河，更是下策之中的下策。美、英、法三国的统治集团现在不应当再存任何侥幸冒险的心理。它们应该认识到，如果它们胆敢进攻埃及人民，站起来抵抗它们的将不仅仅是埃及人民而已。“玩火者必自焚”，这虽然是句老话，可惜的是，在许多冒险家和侵略者真正懂得这句话的意义的时候，已经悔之晚矣。
