Xinhua News Agency, London, September 22nd. The eighteen-nation London conference on the Suez issue, initiated by the three Western powers, concluded on September 21st. The conference released three documents drafted by the "Expert Working Group": a general statement of the conference, a declaration on the establishment of a "Users' Association," and a letter from Dulles to the conference chairman, Lloyd. However, the results of the conference indicate that the three initiating countries, Britain, France, and the United States, did not achieve their intended goals due to the lukewarm attitude of most countries.

The purpose of convening this conference was originally to establish a "Canal Users' Association" in order to seize control of the Suez Canal. However, the danger of this provocative plan was so obvious that if the issue were put to a vote, it would likely cause the conference to split. To avoid this situation, the initiating countries did not push the conference to vote, nor did they force the delegations of the participating countries to assume any obligations for the statements and declarations issued by the conference. Instead, they simply asked them to consult their governments or parliaments on these documents.

The general statement, which was not signed by the participants of the conference, expressed "regret" that Egypt had not accepted Dulles' plan for "international management" of the canal. It demanded that this plan still be used as a "reasonable basis" for resolving the canal issue and declared its rejection of the suggestions made by the Egyptian government on September 10th. The statement requested that the representatives of the participating countries return to their respective countries and consult with their governments to "establish" a "Suez Canal Users' Association" "as soon as possible." The statement also stated that "at any time, if it appears to be helpful to a solution, recourse should be had to the United Nations."

The declaration on the establishment of the "Users' Association" stipulates the qualifications of the participating countries of the "Association" and the purpose of the "Association," etc. It states that the members of the "Association" are limited to "countries that participated in the second London Conference on the Suez issue and that endorse this declaration," as well as "any other participating countries that comply with the various standards stipulated by the Association in the future."

The purposes of the "Association" are: "to promote any steps that may lead to a final or temporary solution to the Suez Canal issue"; "to assist" ships "to pass through the canal safely, orderly, efficiently, and economically, and to seek the cooperation of the qualified authorities in Egypt for this purpose"; "to receive, keep, and handle" the fees paid by any user of the canal; "to help deal with any practical problems arising from the Suez Canal's inability to fully serve its traditional and intended purposes, and to study feasible ways to reduce dependence on the canal accordingly"; "to assist" in the implementation of any temporary solutions that the United Nations may take, etc.

The US representative, Dulles, stated that he would take action to promote the achievement of the goal stipulated in this declaration of infringing on Egyptian sovereignty. In his letter to the chairman of the conference, Lloyd, he said: "The United States, as a member state of this association, will cooperate with other member states to seek to help the association achieve its desired goals." He also said: "As soon as I return home, I will immediately take steps with our Treasury Department officials and representatives of shipowners of American-flagged vessels that pass through the Suez Canal in large numbers to perfect this cooperation with practical working measures."

However, many of the countries participating in the conference expressed varying degrees of reservations.

The representative of Pakistan, who opposed the establishment of the "Users' Association," did not send anyone to participate in the "Expert Working Group" meeting on the morning of the 21st, and he refused to be responsible for any of the documents proposed by this working group.

The representatives of Japan and Iran did not express a clear attitude.

The governments of Sweden, Denmark, and Norway have not yet authorized their representatives to endorse this plan. Only the Norwegian representative said that he would actively recommend that his government join the association.

The Ethiopian representative expressed regret that he could not make a final decision, although he believed that the later content of the plan was better than the original proposal, which he opposed.

The Spanish representative said that the final decision would be made by his government. At the same time, he expressed his willingness to participate in this plan, but with the same reservations he made at the previous London conference.

Italy expressed its willingness to become a member of the "Users' Association," but both it and Spain said that they opposed taking measures such as boycotts against Egypt and could not guarantee that they would pay ship transit fees to the "Association" instead of the Egyptian authorities.

The Turkish representative said that for technical reasons, he was not yet able to decide to formally participate in this plan, but Turkey is considered likely to actually participate in this plan.

Only the representatives of Australia, the Netherlands, Portugal, West Germany, and New Zealand said that they would strive to ask their respective countries' governments to approve this plan.

### 美英法夺取运河管理权的计划受挫  十八国意见分歧伦敦会议草草结束

    美英法夺取运河管理权的计划受挫
    十八国意见分歧伦敦会议草草结束
    据新华社伦敦22日电　西方三国所发起的片面讨论苏伊士问题的十八国伦敦会议，已经在9月21日结束。会议公布了由“专家工作组”草拟的三个文件：会议的一般性声明、关于成立“使用国协会”的宣言和杜勒斯致会议主席劳埃德的信。但是，会议的结果表明，由于多数国家的冷淡，英法美三个发起国并没有能够达到它们预定的目的。
    召开这个会议本来是为了成立“运河使用国协会”，以便夺取苏伊士运河管理权，但是这种挑衅性计划的危险是这样明显，如果把问题付诸表决，就很可能会使会议形成分裂。为了避免这种情况，发起国没有促使会议进行表决，没有迫使参加会议的各国代表团对会议公布的声明和宣言承担任何义务，而只是请它们征求政府或议会对这些文件的意见。
    未经会议参加者签署的一般性声明对埃及没有接受杜勒斯的“国际管理”运河计划表示“遗憾”，要求仍然以这个计划作为解决运河问题的“合理基础”，并且宣布拒绝埃及政府9月10日提出的建议。声明要求与会国代表回国和各自政府商量后“及早建立”“苏伊士运河使用国协会”。声明还表示“在任何时候，只要看起来会有助于解决，就应求助于联合国”。
    关于建立“使用国协会”的宣言规定了“协会”参加国的资格和“协会”宗旨等。它说，“协会”的会员只限于“参加过第二次伦敦苏伊士问题会议并且赞成本宣言的国家”以及“遵守协会今后所规定的各项准则的任何其他参加国”。
    “协会”的宗旨是：“促进可能导致苏伊士运河问题的最后或临时解决的任何步骤”；“帮助”船只“安全地、有秩序地、有效地和经济地通过运河，并为这个目的觅致埃及有资格当局的合作”；“接受、保管和处理”运河的任何使用者付出的费用；“帮助处理由于苏伊士运河不能充分服务于它的传统的和预定的目的而引起的任何实际问题，并随即研究足以减少对运河的依赖的可行办法”；“协助”执行联合国所可能采取的任何临时解决办法等等。
    美国代表杜勒斯表示他将以行动来促使达到这个宣言中所规定的侵犯埃及主权的目的。他在致会议主席劳埃德的信里说：“美国，作为这个协会的一个成员国，将和其他成员国合作，来设法帮助这个协会达到它想达到的目的。”他还说：“我一回国就将立即和我们的财政部官员们以及大量通过苏伊士运河的挂美国旗的船只的船主代表们采取步骤，以便以实际的工作措施来使这种合作趋于完善。”
    但是参加会议的许多国家却在各种程度上表示了不同程度的保留态度。
    反对成立“使用国协会”的巴基斯坦代表并没有派遣任何人参加21日上午的“专家工作组”会议，他拒绝对这个工作组提出的文件中的任何一点负责。
    日本代表和伊朗代表没有表示明确态度。
    瑞典、丹麦和挪威三国政府还没有授权他们的代表赞成这项计划。只有挪威代表说：他将积极建议他的政府参加这个协会。
    埃塞俄比亚代表对于他不能作出最后的决定这一点表示遗憾，虽然他认为计划的后来的内容要比原来的主张好，他是反对原来的主张的。
    西班牙代表说，最后决定要由他的政府来作。同时，他表示愿意参加这项计划，不过要有像他在前一次伦敦会议上所作的那种保留。
    意大利表示愿意成为“使用国协会”的成员，但是它和西班牙都说，它们反对对埃及采取像抵制这样的措施，并且不能保证向“协会”而不向埃及当局缴纳船只通航费。
    土耳其代表说，由于技术上的缘故，他现在还不能够决定正式参加这项计划，但是，土耳其被认为实际上将参加这个计划。
    只有澳大利亚、荷兰、葡萄牙、西德和新西兰代表说，他们将努力要求各自国家的政府批准这项计划。
