Czechoslovak President Zápotocký accepted Sukarno's invitation to pay a state visit to Indonesia. The date of the visit will be decided later.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, September 27th: President Sukarno and his entourage left Prague by plane on the morning of the 26th.

Czechoslovak President Zápotocký and Prime Minister Široký and others went to the airport to see off the distinguished guests.

In his farewell speech to Sukarno, Zápotocký said: "We had the opportunity to exchange views on various international issues and discuss the further development of our bilateral relations. In our discussions, we reached a broad consensus on many important issues in the current international situation, such as disarmament, the prohibition of the use and testing of atomic and thermonuclear weapons, opposition to colonialism, recognition of the legitimate status of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations, and the peaceful settlement of the Suez Canal issue while fully respecting Egypt's legitimate rights."

Zápotocký said: We unanimously agreed that the relations between our two countries are based on the Five Principles. These talks have shown that we share a common desire to expand and strengthen economic, technological, cultural, and scientific cooperation between our two countries. He said it is clear that our basic views are consistent because they stem from the desire of the two peoples to strive for lasting peaceful coexistence and strengthen peaceful cooperation among all nations.

In his reply, President Sukarno said: "You are very right, we have a common position on all international issues, and we have a consistent view. It is precisely this consistency that consolidates our friendship."

Referring to the common goals and ideals of the two peoples, Sukarno emphasized that there are three links between the two countries, namely: "The suffering and sacrifices endured in the past, the common position and views on various international issues, and the common ideals and common goals for the future. All these three links enable our friendship to be consolidated and maintained for a long time."
