Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, September 9th. The Chinese Communist Party committees at all levels in Jiangsu Province recently organized a large number of cadres to go deep into rural areas to carry out investigative research work. Currently, they are comprehensively studying the special topic of how to ensure that 90% of the members increase their income. According to the specific conditions of different regions, different economic characteristics, and different types of agricultural cooperatives, the work is divided to investigate 300 representative agricultural cooperatives, preparing to submit relatively complete materials around mid-September for the Provincial Party Committee to conduct systematic analysis and research. The province has formulated 63 special topics in agricultural production, sideline production, management of agricultural cooperatives, and the cooperative relationship of relevant departments in rural production, implementing upper and lower level division of labor and departmental division of labor for investigation and research.

Party committees at all levels dispatched a large number of cadres with considerable expertise to the countryside to carry out this work. The Rural Work Department of the Provincial Party Committee already has five working groups conducting investigative research in relevant areas. Some have already completed their investigations, and some are still in progress. Local Party committees and county Party committees have also formed hundreds of working groups, led by responsible cadres, to go to the countryside to conduct investigations according to pre-determined special topics. The CCP Yancheng Prefectural Committee dispatched more than 20 cadres to Sheyang, Jianhu, Binhai and other seven counties to investigate special topics such as "cultivation reform," "labor management," and "democratic cooperative management." The CCP Songjiang Prefectural Committee conducted investigations on special topics such as "the scale of agricultural cooperatives," "members' private plots," "rural nurseries," "equal pay for men and women for equal work," and "members' pocket money" in the region. The CCP Xuzhou Prefectural Committee investigated four special topics in the region: "grain and cotton crop layout," "draught cattle," "water conservancy construction," and "agricultural cooperatives developing processing industries." The CCP Yangzhou Prefectural Committee focused on investigating internal problems of agricultural cooperatives, and together with the investigation and research on agricultural production in the region, it can recently submit ten special topic reports. The CCP Zhenjiang Prefectural Committee and various counties cooperated to determine to conduct 13 special topic investigations and research on mountain forests, aquatic products, agricultural sideline occupations, and income distribution in the region. Cadres participating in this work have been dispatched successively, striving to produce 1,680 special topic reports before the end of the year. The cadres dispatched by the CCP Huaiyin Prefectural Committee also assisted in solving problems found locally. Su Nong, member of the Prefectural Committee and Commissioner of the Huaiyin Special Administrative Office, discovered in Suqian County that some agricultural cooperatives had retained more seeds and production expenses during the summer pre-distribution, so he promptly helped the county Party committee to study and solve the problem. Through the summer pre-distribution settlement work, 4.04 million catties of extra grain were cleared out from 574 agricultural cooperatives and distributed to the members, solving the difficulties of many members.

    江苏省各级党委派出大批干部
    深入农村进行专题调查研究工作
    新华社南京9日电　中共江苏省各级党委最近组织大批干部深入农村开展调查研究工作，目前正在全面研究如何保证90％社员增加收入的这个专题。各地按照不同地区、不同经济特点和不同类型的农业社的具体情况，分工调查三百个有代表性的农业社，准备在本月中旬前后提出比较完整的材料，供省委作系统地分析研究。全省在农业生产、副业生产、农业社经营管理以及农村生产中有关部门的协作关系等方面，订出了六十三个专题，实行上下分工和部门分工，进行调查研究。
    各级党委派出大批具有相当水平的干部下乡进行这一工作。省委农村工作部已有五个工作组分别到有关地区进行调查研究，有的已经结束调查工作，有的正在进行调查。各地委、县委也组成了上百个工作组，由负责干部率领下乡，按照预定的专题进行调查工作。中共盐城地委派出二十多名干部分别赴射阳、建湖、滨海等七个县，调查“耕作改制”、“劳动管理”、“民主办社”等专题。中共松江地委就本地区的“农业社的规模”、“社员自留田”、“农村托儿所”、“男女同工同酬”、“社员零用钱”等专题进行调查。中共徐州地委调查本地区的“粮食棉花作物布局”、“耕牛”、“兴修水利”、“农业社发展加工业”等四个专题。中共扬州地委着重调查研究农业社内部的问题，连同对本地区农业生产的调查研究在内，最近可以提出十个专题报告。中共镇江地委和各县分工合作，确定就本地区山林、水产、农业副业和收益分配等方面作十三个专题的调查研究，参加这一工作的干部已陆续出发，争取在年底以前作出一千六百八十份专题报告。中共淮阴地委下乡的干部，还同时协助当地具体解决发现的问题。地委委员兼淮阴专署专员苏农在宿迁县发现有些农业社在夏季预分时多留了种子和生产费用等情况，就及时帮助县委研究解决。通过夏季预分结账工作，在五百七十四个农业社中清理出多留的粮食四百零四万斤，全部分给社员，解决了许多社员的困难。
