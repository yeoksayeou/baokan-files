    Wuhan Fire Engine Factory Breaks Promises
    Renovation of Fire Truck Repeatedly Delayed
    Our fire brigade urgently needs a "fire scene lighting fire truck" to carry out firefighting missions. When the state-owned Wuhan Fire Engine Factory heard that we wanted to modify a car into such a fire truck, the deputy director, the head of the technology section, and the head of the sales section came to our team several times in the summer of 1955 to talk, promoting their superior technology and expressing their great willingness to undertake the modification work. We believed their promotion and transported the car to Wuhan in November 1955; in December 1955, we prepaid all the modification fees to them. At that time, it was agreed that the car would be delivered by the end of March 1956. But since then, they have not actively tried to carry out the modification work, and even the contract was delayed until March 1956, when the car should have been delivered, before it was signed. At that time, they promised to deliver the car by May 25. When the time came, they wrote again saying: "The lighting car can be modified by the end of May, it is best to send someone from your team to check it." However, when our people went to see, the car was still parked in the workshop, not only unfinished, but basically not started. When asked why it was not modified, the answer was: because some main materials, such as light wires, lamp holders, etc., were difficult to purchase. However, after the urging of our comrades, the materials were solved on the spot at that time (light wires were bought, and lamp holders could be modified in the factory). We negotiated again, and their factory director said that emergency measures should be taken to ensure delivery of the car on July 5, and personally signed a guarantee. Who would have thought that by the delivery date, there was still no news. We had to make another long-distance call to inquire. They replied: "It can be shipped before July 20, and it can arrive in Beijing around the 28th." However, by the end of the month, the car was still not seen. When asked again, the reply was: "The electrical aspects are being reworked and repaired, and the gearbox is overheating and cannot be solved, so it is also being studied and improved." In this way, the delivery of the car has become a distant prospect.
    For this matter, we have traveled back and forth between Beijing and Wuhan four times, plus correspondence, costing a total of seven or eight hundred yuan. However, the car urgently needed for firefighting has not yet been obtained. We want to ask: Why is the Wuhan Fire Engine Factory so untrustworthy? We want to ask: When exactly does the Wuhan Fire Engine Factory plan to delay the delivery date to?

### 武汉消防机器厂言而无信  改装救火车再三脱期

    武汉消防机器厂言而无信
    改装救火车再三脱期
    我们消防大队在执行救火任务中，迫切需要一辆“火场照明消防车”。国营武汉消防机器厂听说我们要用汽车改装一辆这样的消防车，就派副厂长、技术股长、供销股长等在1955年夏天先后数次到我队面谈，宣传他们有优越的技术，表示极愿承担改装工作。我们信了他们的宣传，1955年11月把汽车运到武汉；1955年12月，改装款全部预付给他们。当时言定1956年3月底交车。但是从此以后，他们就没有积极设法进行改装工作，连合同也一直拖到1956年3月本来应该交车的时候才签定。当时，他们答应到5月25日交车。到时候，他们又来信说：“照明车可于5月底改装就绪，最好请你队派员前来查验。”可是，我们去人一看，车子还停在车间里，不但没有完工，根本没有施工。问他们为什么没有改装好，答复是：因为有些主要材料，如灯线、灯头等采购困难。可是，经我们去的同志督促以后，材料就在当时当地解决了（灯线买到了，灯头厂里可以改装）。我们又进行交涉，他们厂长表示要采取紧急措施，保证在7月5日交车，并且亲自签署了一纸保证。谁想到，到交车日期，仍旧毫无消息。我们只好再打长途电话询问。他们答复说：“7月20日以前可以启运，28日左右可以到达北京。”可是，到了月底，仍然不见车来。再问他们，答复却是：“电气方面正在返工修理，牙箱发热无法解决，也正在研究改进。”这样一来，交车的事竟变得遥遥无期了。
    为了这件事，我们曾经往返北京—武汉四趟，加以函电来往，共耗费七、八百元。但是，救火急用的车子仍未拿到。我们要问：武汉消防机器厂为什么毫无信义？我们要问：武汉消防机器厂究竟准备把交车日期拖到几时？
