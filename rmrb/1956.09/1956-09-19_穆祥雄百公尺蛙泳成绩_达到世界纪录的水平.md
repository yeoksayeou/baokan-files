Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, September 18th. Chinese famous swimmer Mu Xiangxiong won first place in the 100-meter breaststroke with a time of 1 minute 9.6 seconds at the China-Poland swimming competition held in Bytom, Poland (in Stalinogród) on September 16th. This result has reached the level of the world record.

As of June of this year, the men's 100-meter breaststroke world record recognized by the International Amateur Swimming Federation was 1 minute 8.2 seconds, set by Japan's Masaru Furukawa. Furukawa set this record in a 25-meter swimming pool, while the swimming pool used by Mu Xiangxiong in this competition was 33.3 meters long, so he had one less opportunity to turn and use his legs to push off than in a 25-meter swimming pool.

Furukawa's time when he won first place in the 100-meter breaststroke at the Japanese National Swimming Championships in August this year was 1 minute 10.7 seconds (50-meter pool).

Participating in this competition with Mu Xiangxiong was the famous Polish athlete and former world record holder for the 100-meter breaststroke, Piotr Petrusewicz, with a time of 1 minute 9.8 seconds (25-meter pool). This time, his result was 1 minute 12.2 seconds, earning him third place.

    穆祥雄百公尺蛙泳成绩
    达到世界纪录的水平
    新华社华沙18日电　中国著名游泳运动员穆祥雄9月16日在波兰的贝托姆（在斯大林诺格罗德）举行的中、波游泳赛中，以1分9.6秒的成绩获得了一百公尺蛙泳第一名。这个成绩已经达到了世界纪录的水平。
    到今年6月为止，国际业余游泳联合会所承认的男子一百公尺蛙泳世界纪录是日本的古川所创造的1分8.2秒。古川是在二十五公尺的游泳池内创造这个成绩的，而穆祥雄这次比赛用的游泳池长度是33.3公尺，因此，他比在二十五公尺游泳池内少了一次转身利用腿蹬的机会。
    古川今年8月在日本全国游泳赛中获得一百公尺蛙泳第一名时的成绩是1分10.7秒（池长五十公尺）。
    同穆祥雄一起参加这项比赛的有波兰著名运动员、以前的一百公尺蛙泳世界纪录1分9.8秒（池长二十五公尺）的创造者皮特鲁塞维茨。这次他的成绩是1分12.2秒，获得了第三名。
