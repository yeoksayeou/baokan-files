To help advanced cooperatives with land planning, the Ministry of Agriculture has established a Land Survey and Design Institute.

(By our staff reporter) After agricultural cooperation, various cooperatives urgently need to comprehensively plan the land of the entire cooperative in order to utilize it rationally, improve farming techniques, and carry out capital construction in a planned manner. The Land Survey and Design Institute of the Ministry of Agriculture will lead the gradual development of this work in various regions. The Institute dispatched eight working groups in mid-August to fourteen provinces to assist in pilot land planning work for advanced agricultural production cooperatives, summarize the experience of land planning work in different regions, and train cadres, creating conditions for large-scale land planning work next year. The Land Utilization Bureau, the Mechanical Engineering Bureau, and the preparatory group of the Academy of Agricultural Sciences of the Ministry of Agriculture have also sent personnel to participate in this work.

    帮助高级社进行土地规划
    农业部成立土地勘测设计所
    本报讯　农业部最近成立了负责领导农业生产合作社土地规划工作的机构——土地勘测设计所。
    农业合作化以后，各个合作社迫切需要把全社土地进行通盘规划，以便合理利用，改进耕作技术，有计划地进行基本建设。农业部土地勘测设计所将领导各地逐步开展这一工作。该所已于8月中旬派出八个工作组分赴十四个省，协助进行高级农业生产合作社的土地规划试点工作，并总结不同地区进行土地规划工作的经验，培养干部，为明年大规模开展土地规划工作创造条件。农业部土地利用总局、机械总局和农业科学院筹备小组等单位也派出工作人员参加这一工作。
