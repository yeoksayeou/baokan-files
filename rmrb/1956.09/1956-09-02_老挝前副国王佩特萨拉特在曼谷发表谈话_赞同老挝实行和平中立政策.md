    Xinhua News Agency, Bangkok, September 1st: Former Vice-King Phetsarath of Laos told Bangkok reporters on August 25th that peaceful coexistence should be the basic foreign policy of Laos. Laos should implement a neutral policy like that of Switzerland, that is, to have no military connection with any country but to establish friendly relations with its neighbors. There can be no other policy besides this.

    Phetsarath has been in exile in Thailand since 1945 after being exiled by the French colonial authorities for fighting for national independence. Recently, at the invitation of the Lao government, he has decided to return home in the near future.

    Phetsarath also emphasized that Laos cannot join the Manila Treaty Organization. He believes that this treaty is explicitly anti-communist, which is tantamount to declaring hostility towards Laos' neighbors.

    When talking about the slanderous argument that China would "invade" Southeast Asian countries, Phetsarath said that the Western countries' propaganda can never make the Lao people believe and worry about it. Modern Chinese history proves that China has only been brutally invaded and ravaged by others, and has never invaded others. He said, I believe that the Chinese people are a nation that knows propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame, and they will never invade others.

    Phetsarath expressed his full support for the Lao Prime Minister's visit to China.

    老挝前副国王佩特萨拉特在曼谷发表谈话
    赞同老挝实行和平中立政策
    新华社1日讯　曼谷消息：老挝王国前副国王佩特萨拉特在8月25日向曼谷报界发表谈话说，和平共处应当是老挝对外基本政策，老挝应当实行像瑞士那样的中立政策，那就是不同任何国家有军事上的联系而同它的邻国建立友好关系，除此以外再不能有别的政策。
    佩特萨拉特在1945年由于争取国家独立而被法国殖民当局放逐以后，一直流亡在泰国。最近经过老挝政府的邀请，他已经决定在不久以后回国。
    佩特萨拉特还强调说，老挝不能加入马尼拉条约组织。他认为，这个条约标明反共，这就无异宣布同老挝邻国采取敌对了。
    佩特萨拉特在谈到所谓中国会“侵略”东南亚国家的诽谤论调时说，西方国家这种宣传，决不能使老挝人民相信和引为忧虑。中国近代史证明，中国只是惨遭别人侵略蹂躏，而从来没有侵略过别人。他说，我相信，中国人民是知道礼义廉耻的民族，他们决不会侵略别人。
    佩特萨拉特表示完全赞同老挝总理访问中国。
