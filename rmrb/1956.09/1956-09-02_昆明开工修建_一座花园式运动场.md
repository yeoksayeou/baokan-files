    昆明开工修建
    一座花园式运动场
    新华社昆明31日电　一座花园式的运动场，今天在昆明市动工兴建。
    这个运动场里，将建筑能容两万观众的体育场、室内游泳池、比赛馆、篮、排球场、运动员练习场等，共占地约十九万多平方公尺。
    根据设计蓝图，整个运动场将成为一个布满鲜花、草坪、林荫大道的花园。走进运动场，迎面将是一座水花四溅的大喷泉，喷泉周围，种植鲜花和针柏树丛。循着林荫道走去，美丽的金汁江流过运动场，江上的小桥引导观众到体育场。围绕体育场的将是两圈宽广的林荫大道。在这里，观众参观各种激烈的运动比赛以后，还可以散步、憩息和欣赏风景。
    昆明终年气候如春，运动员能够常年在户外活动。
