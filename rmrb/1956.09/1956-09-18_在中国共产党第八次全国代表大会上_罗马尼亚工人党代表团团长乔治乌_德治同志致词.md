Comrades,

On behalf of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party, the working class and all working people of the Romanian People's Republic, I extend warm congratulations to the Eighth Congress of the great fraternal party—the Communist Party of China. We are very excited to be able to participate in your congress, to understand the glorious achievements of the Communist Party of China's activities, to understand the historical experiences and lessons accumulated by the Communist Party of China in the years of carrying out various huge reforms, and to understand the future tasks put forward by the Communist Party of China.

Transforming China into a powerful socialist industrial country is a major historical task. The completion of this task will have a huge impact on the social development of all mankind. In order to accomplish this great task, the Chinese people are working selflessly with high patriotic enthusiasm.

The Chinese people are closely united around the heroic Communist Party, tempered through long-term revolutionary struggles, and united around the Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, the beloved and time-tested leader of the working people. The Communist Party of China is a model of close ties with the masses, constantly going deep into the masses. The masses fully trust the Communist Party of China and resolutely follow it to overcome all difficulties and fight to defend and develop the revolutionary achievements of the people.

The reason why the Chinese people have been able to achieve great victories is that the Communist Party of China has always been faithful to the ever-victorious doctrine of Marxism-Leninism in solving the complex problems of the Chinese revolution. The Communist Party of China has carried out enormous work in building socialist industry, carrying out socialist transformation of agriculture and commerce, carrying out state construction, popularizing culture, raising the people's awareness, and transforming various social strata. The work carried out by the Communist Party of China in all these aspects is an example for other communist parties and workers' parties to creatively apply and enrich the doctrine of Marxism-Leninism based on the specific historical conditions of their own countries.

Comrades, since its founding, the People's Republic of China has won great political and moral prestige. This is because it, together with the Soviet Union, all socialist countries, and other peace-loving countries, has taken various measures to consolidate international peace, strive for peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems, and promote mutual respect for sovereignty, independence, and national interests among all countries. The Romanian people and all peace-loving people regard the political line pursued by the great People's Republic of China in international relations as a powerful factor in consolidating international peace. The existence of the People's Republic of China is a great social historical fact, and no one can ignore the words spoken by the People's China, representing the will and aspirations of 600 million people. It is impossible to solve major international problems without the participation of the People's Republic of China. The reasonable demands of the People's Republic of China and the lofty goals of its foreign policy have received the full support of other socialist countries and have won extensive sympathy and sponsorship internationally.

Comrades, the Romanian people, like the people of other countries in the great socialist camp, regard the great achievements of the talented and hardworking Chinese people as their own achievements and are heartily happy for these achievements. Close friendly relations of cooperation, mutual assistance, and exchange of experience in various aspects of social life have been established between the Romanian People's Republic and the People's Republic of China. This vividly embodies the new type of relations between socialist countries. The foundation of friendship between the Romanian and Chinese peoples is that our two parties have the same desires and goals, have a common social system, and have an unwavering determination to strengthen the internationalist unity of socialist countries and consolidate international peace. Such friendship is truly unbreakable!

The economic ties between People's China and the Romanian People's Republic are strengthening every year and have a bright prospect for continued development. The possibility of exchanging experiences in various industrial technologies already exists and is expanding. Contacts in culture, art, and science are also strengthening. The visits of Chinese cultural workers to the Romanian People's Republic and the visits of Romanian cultural workers to the People's Republic of China have promoted mutual understanding and powerfully demonstrated the friendship between our two brotherly peoples.

Dear comrades, under the leadership of the Romanian Workers' Party, our people are engaged in enthusiastic and intense labor to develop the country's economy and culture, and further consolidate the people's democratic system. The workers, peasants, and intellectuals of the Romanian People's Republic have made significant achievements in the cause of building socialism, in developing industry, agriculture, culture, and improving the people's living standards. The first five-year plan ended in 1955. During the first five-year plan, industrial production more than doubled. Machine manufacturing, the oil industry, the chemical industry, the electrical appliance industry, and the electric power industry are all developing. Agricultural output also increased year by year. The socialist component in agriculture is developing rapidly, and it currently accounts for one-third of the country's agricultural area. During the first five-year plan, national income increased by nearly double. The Romanian people are now concentrating their efforts on realizing the resolutions of the Second Party Congress regarding the tasks of the second five-year plan.

In the struggle to build socialism, our people have received full assistance from the Soviet Union, People's China, and other socialist countries.

The working people of the Romanian People's Republic are overcoming the various difficulties they encounter and are advancing confidently along the road of building socialism.

Comrades, the great ideas of Marxism-Leninism have triumphed in the Soviet Union, which is engaged in communist construction, and now these ideas are also triumphing in China, Romania, and all other countries building socialism. These ideas point out the path of struggle for the people of capitalist countries, dependent countries, and colonial countries.

I wish the Communist Party of China and the fraternal Chinese people continuous new achievements in socialist construction and in the struggle for peace and progress.

Long live the heroic Communist Party of China and the Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong!

Long live the eternal fraternal friendship between the Romanian people and the great Chinese people!

Long live the unbreakable friendship, cooperation, and unity between the peoples of socialist countries!

Long live the great cause of Marx, Engels, and Lenin!

    在中国共产党第八次全国代表大会上
    罗马尼亚工人党代表团团长乔治乌—德治同志致词同志们：
    我代表罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会、罗马尼亚人民共和国的工人阶级和全体劳动人民，向伟大的兄弟党——中国共产党的第八次代表大会，致以热烈的祝贺。我们感到很兴奋，能够参加你们的代表大会，能够了解中国共产党活动的光辉成果，了解中国共产党在进行各种巨大的改革的年代里积累起来的历史经验和教训，了解中国共产党提出的未来的任务。
    把中国改造成一个强大的社会主义工业国，是一项重大的历史任务。这一任务的完成，对全人类的社会发展，有着巨大的影响。为了完成这一伟大的任务，中国人民正以很高的爱国主义热情，忘我地劳动着。
    中国人民紧密地团结在经过长期革命斗争锻炼的英勇的共产党的周围，团结在以劳动人民敬爱的久经考验的领袖毛泽东同志为首的中央委员会的周围。中国共产党是密切联系群众、经常深入群众的榜样。群众完全信任中国共产党，坚决地跟着它走，去克服一切困难，为保卫和发展人民的革命成果而斗争。
    中国人民所以能够获得伟大的胜利，是由于中国共产党在解决复杂的中国革命问题时，始终忠实于百战百胜的马克思列宁主义学说。中国共产党进行了巨大的工作，来建设社会主义工业，对农业和商业实行社会主义改造，进行国家建设，普及文化，提高人民的觉悟，改造各个社会阶层。中国共产党在这一切方面进行的工作，对其他共产党和工人党来说，是根据本国特殊的历史条件创造性地运用和丰富马克思列宁主义学说的榜样。
    同志们，中华人民共和国自建国以来，已经赢得了巨大的政治上和道义上的威信。这是由于它同苏联一起，同所有社会主义国家和其他爱好和平的国家一起，采取了各种措施来巩固国际和平，争取不同社会制度的国家的和平共处，促使所有国家互相尊重主权、独立和民族利益。罗马尼亚人民和各国爱好和平的人民，把伟大的中华人民共和国在国际关系中执行的政治路线，看做是巩固国际和平的强大因素。中华人民共和国的存在，是一个伟大的社会的历史的事实，谁也不能忽视人民中国代表六亿人民的意志和愿望所发表出来的言论。要解决重大的国际问题，没有中华人民共和国的参加，是不可能的。中华人民共和国的合理要求和它对外政策的崇高目的，得到了其他社会主义国家的全力支持，在国际上赢得了广泛的同情和赞助。
    同志们，罗马尼亚人民也和伟大的社会主义阵营中其他国家的人民一样，把天才勤劳的中国人民的伟大成就看作是自己的成就，为这些成就而衷心地感到高兴。在罗马尼亚人民共和国和中华人民共和国之间已经建立了合作、互助、交流社会生活各方面的经验的密切的友好关系。这生动地体现了社会主义国家之间的新型关系。罗中两国人民友谊的基础，是我们两党具有一致的愿望和目的，具有共同的社会制度，都有坚定不移的决心来加强社会主义国家的国际主义团结和巩固国际和平。这样的友谊是真正牢不可破的！
    人民中国和罗马尼亚人民共和国之间的经济联系每年都在加强，而且有着继续向前发展的光辉远景。在各种工业技术方面交流经验的可能性，已经存在，而且在日益扩大。文化、艺术、科学方面的联系也在加强。中国文化工作者的访问罗马尼亚人民共和国，以及罗马尼亚文化工作者的访问中华人民共和国，促进了彼此的了解，有力地显示了我们两国兄弟人民之间的友谊。
    亲爱的同志们，我国人民在罗马尼亚工人党的领导下，正在进行热烈紧张的劳动，来发展本国的经济和文化，进一步巩固人民民主制度。罗马尼亚人民共和国的工人、农民和知识分子，在建设社会主义的事业中，在发展工业、农业、文化以及提高人民生活水平方面，取得了重大的成就。第一个五年计划已经在1955年结束了。在第一个五年计划期间，工业生产增加了一倍多。机器制造业、石油工业、化学工业、电器工业、电力工业都在发展。农业产量也年年增加。农业中的社会主义成份日益发展，目前它已占我国农业面积的三分之一。第一个五年计划期间，国民收入增加了将近一倍。罗马尼亚人民现在正集中精力来实现第二次党代表大会关于第二个五年计划的任务的决议。
    我国人民在建设社会主义的斗争中，得到了苏联、人民中国和其他社会主义国家的全面帮助。
    罗马尼亚人民共和国的劳动人民正在克服他们所遇到的种种困难，满怀信心地沿着建设社会主义的道路前进。
    同志们，马克思列宁主义的伟大思想已经在进行共产主义建设的苏联取得了胜利，现在这种思想也在中国、罗马尼亚和所有其他建设社会主义的国家中取得胜利。这种思想给资本主义国家、附属国和殖民地国家的人民指出了斗争的道路。
    祝中国共产党和兄弟的中国人民在社会主义建设中，在为和平和进步的斗争中，不断获得新的成就。
    英勇的中国共产党和以毛泽东同志为首的中央委员会万岁！
    罗马尼亚人民和伟大的中国人民之间的永恒的兄弟友谊万岁！
    社会主义各国人民之间的牢不可破的友谊、合作和团结万岁！
    马克思、恩格斯、列宁的伟大事业万岁！
