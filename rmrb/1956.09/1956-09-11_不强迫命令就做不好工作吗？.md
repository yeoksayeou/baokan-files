    Can Work Only Be Done Well Through Coercive Orders?
    Duan Xianping

    On the evening of July 21st, the Second Cooperative of the Seventh Team of the Tuanjie Agricultural Cooperative in Tongxi Township, Fengcheng County, Jiangxi Province, held a meeting of cooperative members to summarize summer production and elect model workers. When cooperative member Zuo Fusheng proposed team leader Zuo Guosheng from the fifth team as a candidate for model worker, he immediately received the approval of most cooperative members. Some said Guosheng was responsible in his work; others said Guosheng had a good attitude and never lost his temper with the masses; …

    Just as the cooperative members were enthusiastically expressing their opinions, Deputy Team Leader Zuo Meihua interrupted them and rushed to say, "I disagree! He can't break through sentimentality, doesn't use coercive orders, and has tailism!" Naturally, the cooperative members did not agree with the deputy team leader's opinion, and they offered rebuttals. Deputy Team Leader Zuo Meihua did not consider everyone's opinions and busily offered the following explanations: First, some cooperative members have backward thinking, and persuasion and education have no effect. Without coercive orders, work cannot be done well; second, coercive orders are for doing good work and boosting production. The cooperative members may have opinions at the time, but after harvesting more grain and the cooperative members increase their income, they will thank you. After arguing for a long time, the deputy team leader still insisted on his opinion.

    This kind of thinking of Zuo Meihua is prevalent among some rural workers. Looking at the situation in this cooperative: among the seventeen cadres above the deputy team leader level in the entire cooperative, eight have serious problems with coercive orders. As long as the cooperative members do not act according to their opinions, they readily scold people as "stubborn old fools" and "backward elements," even cursing their parents. Fining work points is even more their important magic weapon. In four months, forty-eight cooperative members in this cooperative were fined work points.

    Can work only be done well through coercive orders? The fact that this cooperative mobilized its members to fight drought can answer this question. When the team leader and deputy team leader of the seventh team led the cooperative members to fight the drought, they neither explained the reasons to the members nor went deep into the masses to discover and solve problems. Instead, they ran around all day, forcing the cooperative members to pump water to fight the drought. As soon as the members stopped, they would give them a big scolding. The result of this was that the cooperative members called them "field bosses"! When they went to inspect, the members would pump water for a while; as soon as they left, the members would stop. Conversely, when the cooperative director led the eighth team (originally the most backward team in the entire cooperative) to fight the drought, because he could fight the drought day and night with the members, and was good at listening to the members' opinions and paying attention to solving the problems in fighting the drought, not only were the members satisfied, but the labor efficiency was also increased by 30%, rescuing two hundred and eighty mu of drought-stricken fields.

    Those who are enthusiastic about coercive orders should learn some lessons from this stark contrast.

    不强迫命令就做不好工作吗？
    段先萍
    7月21日的晚上，江西丰城县桐溪乡团结农业社第二社七队召开社员大会，总结夏季生产和评选模范。当社员左伏生提议五组组长左国生为模范候选人时，立即获得了多数社员的同意。有的说国生工作负责；有的说国生态度好，从来没有向群众发过脾气；……
    正当社员热烈发表意见的时候，副队长左梅华打断了他们的发言，抢着说：“我不同意！他打不破情面，不强迫命令，有尾巴主义！”自然，社员们不会同意副队长的意见，他们提出了反驳。副队长左梅华也不考虑大家的意见，就忙着作了如下解释：第一、有的社员思想落后，说服教育没有作用，不强迫命令就做不好工作；第二、强迫命令是为了做好工作，搞好生产，当时社员可能有意见，过后多打了粮食，社员增加了收入，还会道谢的。争论了好久，副队长还是坚持他的意见。
    左梅华这种看法，在一些农村工作人员中是带有普遍性的。就拿这个社的情况来看：全社十七个副队长以上的干部中，就有八个有严重的强迫命令风作。只要社员没有按照他们的意见办事，他们动不动就骂人家是“老顽固”“落后分子”，甚至骂爹骂娘。罚扣工分，更是他们的重要法宝。这个社在四个月中，就有四十八个社员被罚扣了工分。
    不强迫命令就做不好工作吗？从这个社发动社员抗旱的事实中就可以得到回答。七队正、副队长在领导社员抗旱时，既不向社员讲明道理，又不深入群众发现与解决问题，而是整天跑来跑去，强迫社员车水抗旱。只要社员一停车，就大大批评一顿。这样作的结果是：社员们喊他们为“田老板”！他们去检查，社员们就车一阵；他们一走，社员们就停下车来。相反的，社长在领导八队（原来是全社最落后的队）抗旱时，由于他能日夜和社员一起抗旱，并善于倾听社员的意见，注意解决抗旱中的问题，不仅社员满意，还使劳动效率提高了30％，抢救出二百八十亩受旱的田。
    热衷于强迫命令的人们，应该从这个鲜明的对比中吸取些教训。
