    For Socialist Construction, Strengthen National Planning
    Speech by Comrade Li Fuchun, Vice Premier of the State Council and Director of the State Planning Commission
    I fully endorse Comrade Mao Zedong's opening address, and I fully agree with the three reports of the Central Committee, the draft revised Party Constitution, and the draft suggestions on the Second Five-Year Plan. Now, I would like to express some opinions on the work of national economic planning, and I welcome comrades to point out any errors.
    To build socialism, we must implement a planned economy, so that all aspects of the national economy can carry out production and construction in accordance with the laws of planned and proportionate development. This has long been proven by the experiences of the Soviet Union and other brotherly countries. However, in our country, we must also solve the problem of how to gradually establish a planned economy based on our specific conditions.
    Due to the establishment and consolidation of the people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class, the return of economic lifelines to state ownership, and the successful completion of various democratic reform tasks, the rapid recovery and development of the national economy led by the socialist economy, especially due to the determination of the Party's general line during the transition period, coupled with the example of the Soviet Union's implementation of a planned economy and the enormous assistance of the Soviet Union and other brotherly countries to our economic construction, our country has the basic conditions for implementing a planned economy.
    However, in the process of establishing a planned economy, we are not without difficulties: our country is an economically backward and unevenly developed agricultural country, with an underdeveloped industry and a weak heavy industry base, and the success or failure of agriculture has a great impact on the development of the national economy; before the high tide of socialist transformation arrived, the individual economy and the capitalist economy still accounted for a considerable proportion of the national economy; the situation of geological resources is not yet clear; the foundation of statistical work is weak, and the basis for compiling plans is not complete; and we lack experience in large-scale economic construction, especially industrial construction, and we lack knowledge and experience in national-scale planning work. All of these are the difficulties in our planning work.
    How China's Planned Economy Was Established
    Based on the above situation, the Party and the government have started to establish China's planned economy from the following two aspects.
    The first aspect, which is also the basic aspect, is that in the process of restoring and developing our national economy, the Party Central Committee, based on the trend of economic development and the Party's general line during the transition period, adopted a series of policies and steps, and carried out various arduous organizational work, gradually bringing all aspects and economic components of our national economy into the orbit of the planned economy. These policies and steps mainly include:
    First, the policy of giving priority to the development of the socialist economy. The socialist economy is the main body of the entire national economy, and the plan of the socialist economy is also the main body of the entire national economic plan. Whether in the period of economic recovery or in the period of economic construction, the Party has paid special attention to the development of the socialist economy, so that our socialist economic components, whether in industry, transportation, construction, commerce, foreign trade, or finance, are in an absolute advantage, played a leading role in other economic components, and thus established the backbone of the planned economy.
    Second, the policy of implementing collectivization of agriculture, handicrafts, and other individual economies. Over the past few years, the Party has adopted various transitional forms to gradually organize the scattered individual economies and implemented collectivization. At the same time, the Party has also cut off the connection between the individual economy and the capitalist economy through the unified purchase and sale of several major agricultural products, the implementation of the "three fix" policy for grain, as well as correct price policies and agricultural loan policies, so that scattered individual production develops in the direction required by the state. In this way, various individual economies are gradually brought into the orbit of the national plan according to different circumstances and using different methods.
    Third, the policy of utilizing, restricting, and transforming capitalist industry and commerce. In this regard, the state, through various forms of state capitalism, and by taking various measures in taxation, prices, scope of activities, and working conditions of workers, has made capitalist industry and commerce accept the leadership of the state and gradually transformed into state capitalist industry and commerce. In this way, they are also gradually brought into the orbit of the national plan according to different circumstances and using different forms.
    Practice over the past few years has proved that without the rapid development of the socialist economy, it would be impossible to establish a planned economy; the stronger the socialist economy, which is the main body of the national economy, the more enhanced our planning will be. However, the process of establishing China's planned economy is not only determined by the development of the socialist economy, which is the main body of the national economy, but also largely determined by the gradual development of the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce. The process of gradually implementing socialist transformation of various non-socialist economies is also the process of gradually bringing them into the orbit of the plan.
    The second aspect is that, according to the Party's general line during the transition period, combined with the above-mentioned various policies of the Party, state organs carry out planning work according to appropriate division of labor, different situations, and different methods and forms. In China's national economic plan, in addition to the plans of socialist enterprises, the plans for other economic components still cannot but have a considerable estimated nature. Therefore, in terms of planning methods, some adopt direct plans, and some adopt indirect plans; in terms of the data on which the plans are based, some use statistical figures, and some use estimates; in terms of the scope of the plan, the main indicators of some production, construction, and undertakings are specifically stipulated in the national plan, and some are not specifically stipulated; in terms of the division of labor in planning work, planning organs at all levels, in addition to being responsible for comprehensive balance, focus on direct planning, while in indirect planning (such as agriculture, handicrafts, and private industry and commerce), the method of division of labor management by the offices, ministries, and provinces (cities) and autonomous regions of the State Council is adopted to carry out the work. This method of combining overall planning and differentiated treatment, and combining unified synthesis and division of labor management, basically conforms to China's actual situation.
    We began to formulate national and annual national economic plan control figures from 1951 and 1952, and began to implement the first five-year plan from 1953, and compiled annual plans year by year. The first five-year plan embodies the Party's general line and various specific policies. This plan is correct and basically consistent with the development of China's economic situation. The steps of socialist transformation are slow, but because the Party Central Committee timely and correctly led the work of accelerating socialist transformation, it was not bound by the original regulations in actual work. In each annual plan, although some indicators are set too low or too high, and some aspects are not fully taken care of, the results of the implementation show that the past few annual plans have roughly reflected the actual situation of the year and played a positive role in mobilizing the people of the whole country to ensure the overfulfillment of the five-year plan.
    In general, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Party committees at all levels, the various economic departments and planning organs at all levels have made concerted efforts over the past few years, overcome various difficulties, learned and done at the same time, and the work has been successful. The main thing is to gradually and differentially bring all aspects and economic components of China's national economy into the orbit of the national plan, and to establish a foundation for China's planned economy and successfully implement the first five-year plan.
    Three Issues to Improve the Level of Planning Work
    However, in the past planning work, there were many shortcomings and errors. The most important shortcoming is that our planning work is not comprehensive, accurate, flexible, and lacks foresight. These shortcomings are concentratedly reflected in the incompatibility between our subjective understanding and objective reality in the compilation of plans. In order to overcome the shortcomings and errors in our work and improve the level of planning work, I would like to talk about the following three issues based on the experiences and lessons of planning work in the past few years.
    Mastering the Objective Laws of National Economic Development
    (1) Further understand and master the objective laws of economic development by systematically understanding and studying China's economic situation.
    To do a good job in planning, we must go deep into reality, go deep into the masses, and conscientiously do a good job in investigation and research, find out China's economic situation and its development trend, find out the economic characteristics of various regions and aspects, and master the accurate basis for compiling plans. In this regard, the State Planning Commission has not done enough. The State Planning Commission used to be responsible for both long-term plans and annual plans, and at one time it was also responsible for industrial administration and basic construction work, so it was often busy with compiling and revising plans, busy with daily economic affairs, lacking systematic investigation and research, lacking foresight, and easily affected by certain temporary and local phenomena. The objective laws of economic development, especially the economic characteristics of the transition period, have not been studied enough. The plans are issued late and change a lot. It also lacks in-depth understanding of the different characteristics, special requirements, and regional economic development of various localities. In addition, it does not follow the mass line enough when compiling plans and solving certain important problems in the national economy, so it cannot but commit subjectivism and bureaucracy. The problem of determining the increase in exports of small steel and cement in 1955, the problem of double-wheeled double-furrow plows in 1956, and other problems are concrete manifestations of this error.
    In order to overcome the above shortcomings, in addition to strengthening the study of Marxism-Leninism, especially political economy, planning organs and economic departments at all levels must also strengthen their understanding of the situation at the grassroots level, strengthen systematic investigation and research on the trend of economic development, further find out the current and long-term needs of various departments and regions, find out the potential strengths and weak links in the national economy, analyze the implementation of various technical and economic norms, and summarize and promote various advanced experiences in production and construction. Only in this way can we obtain a reliable basis for calculating needs and possibilities, and establish a reliable foundation for the comprehensive balance of the plan.
    The Party Central Committee and the State Council decided this year to divide the management of long-term plans and annual plans into two institutions, which is necessary and helps to deepen the actual work of planning. In order to do a good job in planning, long-term planning and annual planning must be closely combined and complement each other. Long-term plans should be stable and reliable, and should plan a more appropriate direction and outline for the development of annual plans, and stipulate annual indicators on the basis of annual balance. When stipulating annual indicators, we should consider the new situations and new problems that may arise in future years, and reserve certain backup forces to facilitate the arrangement of annual plans. The annual plan should be more in-depth and specific based on the actual situation of the year, taking into account the mutual connection between each year and the upper and lower years, tapping the potential of all aspects, and making appropriate adjustments to the annual indicators of the long-term plan to ensure the annual realization and overfulfillment of the tasks stipulated in the long-term plan. At the same time, special attention must be paid to: when the economic situation is smooth, we must fully estimate the difficult side, and do not be carried away by success; and when there are difficulties, we must estimate the favorable conditions, and do not be frightened. In this way, both long-term plans and annual plans can have foresight and conform to the current situation, and it is possible to make fewer or no mistakes of rash advance or conservatism.
    However, neither long-term plans nor annual plans can fully anticipate all the new situations and new problems that may arise in economic life. Therefore, in order to make the plan more in line with reality and better guide economic development, it is necessary to thoroughly check the implementation of the plan, rely on the masses, constantly discover and solve new problems, supplement and revise the original understanding from the development of actual life, and then use the improved understanding to guide the adjustment and compilation of the plan. In this way, it is possible to gradually increase our foresight and help us master the objective laws of economic development.
    Mastering the Law of Planned and Proportional Development
    (2) Strengthen the work of comprehensive balance and overall arrangement, and master the law of planned and proportional development.
    All aspects of the national economy are an organically combined whole, which affects and restricts each other. Excessive prominence or excessive backwardness in any aspect will cause imbalances in proportional relationships and hinder the development of the entire national economy. Therefore, planning work must proceed from gradually overcoming the above-mentioned first shortcoming to achieve "knowing the situation well," maintain an objective and comprehensive attitude, study the internal connections of things, master the laws of planned and proportional development, and do a good job in comprehensive balance and overall arrangement. This is also the basic responsibility of planning organs at all levels.
    In this regard, the State Planning Commission has also not done enough in the past. In actual work, we have paid more attention to central state-owned industries, and not enough attention to local industries, agriculture, commerce, cultural and educational undertakings, and other aspects; even some things that should be managed have not been managed, while some things that should not be managed have been managed. In short, the work of comprehensive balance has not been done enough, and the research has not been enough. On some issues, it is easy to produce one-sided views and local views, or spontaneity in the guidance of the plan. For example, in the past, when the development of agriculture lagged behind the needs of people's consumption and national construction, no effective measures were proposed to overcome this; in the relationship between coastal and inland areas, insufficient attention was paid to the full and rational use of coastal industries; in the relationship between wages, labor productivity, and life supply, there was a period of time when the arrangement was not appropriate, and some deviations occurred; in the basic construction plan in 1956, because the material balance work was not done well, some disconnections occurred between the needs of construction projects and the possibility of material supply, and the control in the implementation of the plan was not enough, causing unnecessary tension in the economy and finance. Although the above-mentioned specific problems have been instructed by the Party Central Committee and the State Council to solve, they should still be paid attention to frequently in the future; otherwise, the country's economic construction work will suffer greater losses.
    In order to overcome the above shortcomings, we must conscientiously strengthen the work of comprehensive balance and overall arrangement. Not only should we conduct comprehensive balance and overall arrangement for all aspects of the national economy that are interrelated, that is to say, not only should we conduct comprehensive balance and overall arrangement between industry and agriculture, production and circulation, production and construction and transportation, economy and finance, accumulation and consumption, labor and wages, cost and price, production and distribution, material supply and material reserve, economy and culture and education, economic and cultural and educational construction and national defense administration, central and local, and various ethnic groups and regions; but also comprehensive balance and overall arrangement are needed in each aspect and each region of the national economy itself. Taking industry as an example, comprehensive balance and overall arrangement are needed between heavy industry and light industry, within heavy industry, within light industry, between various industries, between raw material industry and processing industry, between production and construction, between construction scale and geological resources, between supply, production and sales, between original industry and newly built industry, between coastal industry and inland industry, between central industry and local industry, between state-owned industry and joint state-private industry, between the mutual coordination of large and small enterprises, and between industrial construction and urban construction. This is indeed a meticulous work with thousands of threads and complicated intricacies. If you are not careful, it is easy to lose sight of one thing and the other and make one-sided mistakes.
    Therefore, to do this work well, first, we must be based on the Party's general line and various guidelines and policies, and combine key points and overall considerations. Egalitarianism that ignores key points or weakens key points, isolationism that only cares about key points and ignores other things, and local ideas that excessively emphasize one aspect or one region are all contrary to the Party's guidelines and policies and are harmful to the planned development of the national economy.
    Second, we must pay attention to correctly mastering the laws of planned and proportional development of the national economy. Proportional relationships have their own certain laws, and must be stipulated according to China's specific conditions. However, the proportions set are not rigid formulas, and there must be different degrees of proportions under different economic circumstances. Only by repeatedly balancing calculations based on actual needs and possibilities can we more appropriately stipulate the proportional relationships in all aspects of the national economy, and these must be revised and supplemented in practice.
    Third, we must proceed from a positive and developmental point of view. In economic life, balance is relative. Overcoming the old imbalance will lead to new imbalances. Actual life is developing in the contradiction between balance and imbalance. Our responsibility is to proceed from a developmental point of view, take active measures, and constantly discover and overcome new weak links, overcome new imbalances, and make the entire national economy move towards a new upsurge step by step.
    Fourth, we must also adopt the method of unified leadership, division of labor and collaboration. The central planning agency is responsible for the national and overall comprehensive balance; the planning agencies in various regions and departments must also conscientiously strengthen their own comprehensive balance work, strengthen the overall perspective, and improve the comprehensive balance methods. Make the regional and departmental comprehensive balance organically combined with the national and comprehensive comprehensive balance.
    Improve the System and Methods of Planning Work
    (3) Adapt to the new situation and improve the system and methods of planning work in accordance with the principle of combining centralized unity and adapting to local conditions.
    Planning work is completely a new business for our country. We must humbly and systematically learn from the Soviet Union and other brotherly countries, and be good at combining the advanced experiences of various brotherly countries with China's actual situation. Over the past few years, on the basis of learning from the Soviet Union and other brotherly countries, we have stipulated some systems, procedures, forms, and methods for planning work. These provisions are necessary for establishing China's planning work and are basically applicable. In this regard, the planning work experience of various brotherly countries, especially the Soviet Union, has helped us avoid many detours. Our shortcoming is that we have not learned enough, we are not good at combining the unity of the national plan with the flexibility of adapting to the time, place, and circumstances, and we have not improved the system of planning work in a timely manner according to the changes in the situation. For example, the scope of classified management was not appropriately stipulated in the national plan, nor was the scope of flexible adjustment for various departments and regions within a certain range; the investment limits for some basic construction projects were stipulated too low; the approval procedures for some design task books were stipulated too centrally for a period of time; some form indicators were stipulated too complicated; therefore, the enthusiasm and creativity of various departments, regions, and grassroots enterprises were somewhat constrained. This problem of managing too much and too rigidly must be overcome.
    China's current economic situation is that socialist transformation has achieved a decisive victory, and socialist construction has formed a new upsurge due to the successful implementation of the first five-year plan. In order to adapt to this new situation, the planning system and planning methods must be appropriately changed so that our planning work can better meet the overall requirement of mobilizing all positive factors to accelerate socialist construction. We must enable the main indicators of the various items controlled by the state in the plan, which have significant national economic significance, to enhance their guiding role in economic activities; and enable the various indicators controlled by local and departmental authorities to have greater flexibility so as to better leverage the enthusiasm of various departments, regions, and grassroots enterprises and ensure the early and overfulfillment of the plan.
    Therefore, in terms of the planning system, it is necessary to implement classified management. The principle of classified management is to take into account both centralized unity and adapting to local conditions. All important indicators that need to be balanced uniformly nationwide shall be comprehensively balanced by the State Planning Commission and the State Economic Commission, and shall be included in the national plan after being reported to the State Council for approval, and shall be issued uniformly by the State Council; various local, partial, and regional balances or departmental self-balancing indicators shall be balanced and arranged by the provinces (cities), autonomous regions, or various departments themselves according to the circumstances and local conditions, and shall also be reported to the State Council for record, so that they can be comprehensively incorporated into the national plan; other many minor indicators that are numerous and difficult to grasp, and therefore cannot be included in the national plan one by one, shall be arranged by local or grassroots units themselves, and the state shall only plan from a larger perspective and regulate them from price policies and supply and sales relations. Various indicators included in the national plan can be divided into three types, namely mandatory indicators, adjustable indicators, and reference indicators. If various departments and regions want to modify mandatory indicators, they must be approved by the State Council; adjustable indicators can be adjusted by themselves within a certain range and a certain margin stipulated by the State Council. To adapt to the above methods, certain outdated and inappropriate provisions in the systems, procedures, and forms of planning and statistical work should be studied and revised as soon as possible.
    Strengthening the Leadership of Party Committees at All Levels over Planning Work
    In order to rapidly improve the level of planning work, we require Party committees at all levels to strengthen their leadership over planning work. Planning work is an important and arduous task for our country to carry out socialist construction and implement a planned economy. It is also an important link that Party committees at all levels must master in order to strengthen the comprehensive leadership of socialist construction. Therefore, we require Party committees at all levels to improve planning organs, strengthen the policy thinking and overall perspective of planning workers, improve their theoretical level and scientific knowledge, pay attention to preventing planning organs from falling into the small circle of simple calculation or daily affairs, educate all planning workers to follow the mass line, help them strengthen their connections with scientists, experts, advanced producers, and advanced workers, cultivate the ability of planning work from deeply studying problems, and gradually make planning workers become planning economy experts who can master the Party's policies, are familiar with planning business, and are closely connected with the masses. At the same time, statistical work should be improved and strengthened accordingly.
    Now, the Party Central Committee has submitted the "Suggestions on the Second Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy" to the Eighth National Congress. I think this suggestion is correct and appropriate. The current task of planning organs at all levels is to cooperate with various economic departments and various regions to prepare the second five-year plan based on this suggestion. We believe that under the call of the Eighth National Congress of the Party, under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, relying on the strength of the whole Party and the people of the whole country, if we work diligently, this task can definitely be completed. Moreover, as long as we are good at mobilizing all positive factors in the country, plus the support of the Soviet Union and other brotherly countries, the various tasks stipulated in the suggestions of the second five-year plan can definitely be successfully completed.

专栏：

    为了社会主义建设，加强全国的计划工作
    国务院副总理、国家计划委员会主任　李富春同志的发言
    我完全拥护毛泽东同志的开幕词，完全同意党中央的三个报告、党章修改草案和关于第二个五年计划的建议草案。现在，我就国民经济计划工作方面发表一些意见，请同志们指正。
    要建设社会主义，就要实行计划经济，使国民经济的各方面，按照有计划按比例发展的规律来进行生产和建设，这是苏联和其他兄弟国家的经验早已证明了的。但是在我国，还必须解决如何根据我国的具体条件来逐步建立计划经济的问题。
    由于工人阶级领导的人民民主专政制度的建立和巩固，经济命脉的收归国有和各项民主改革任务的胜利完成，以社会主义经济为领导的国民经济的迅速恢复和发展，特别是由于党在过渡时期的总路线的确定，加上苏联实行计划经济的榜样及苏联和各兄弟国家对于我国经济建设的巨大援助，就使我国具备了实行计划经济的基本条件。
    但是在建立计划经济的过程中，我们并不是没有困难的：我国是一个经济落后而发展又很不平衡的农业国家，工业既不发达，重工业基础又薄弱，而农业的丰收或歉收对国民经济的发展又影响很大；在社会主义改造高潮到来以前，个体经济和资本主义经济在国民经济中还占着相当大的比重；地质资源的情况还不清楚；统计工作的基础薄弱，编制计划的根据还不完全；而我们对大规模的经济建设特别是工业建设还缺乏经验，对全国规模的计划工作更缺乏知识和经验。所有这些就是我们计划工作中的困难。
    我国的计划经济是怎样建立的
    根据上述情况，党和政府是从以下两个方面来着手建立我国的计划经济的。
    第一个方面，也是基本的方面，就是在恢复和发展我国国民经济的过程中，党中央根据经济发展的趋势和党在过渡时期的总路线，采取了一系列的政策和步骤，进行了各种艰巨的组织工作，把我国国民经济的各个方面和各种经济成份逐步地纳入了计划经济的轨道。这些政策和步骤主要的是：
    第一，优先发展社会主义经济的政策。社会主义经济是整个国民经济的主体，社会主义经济的计划也是整个国民经济计划的主体。在经济恢复时期或经济建设时期，党都特别注意了社会主义经济的发展，使我国的社会主义经济成份，不论是工业、运输业、建筑业、商业、对外贸易或金融业，都处于绝对的优势，发挥了对其他经济成份的领导作用，从而建立了计划经济的骨干。
    第二，对农业、手工业和其他个体经济实行合作化的政策。几年来，党采取了各种过渡形式把分散的个体经济逐步组织起来，实行了合作化。同时，党又通过对几种主要农产品的统购统销、对粮食实行三定政策以及正确的价格政策和农贷政策等，割断了个体经济同资本主义经济的联系，使分散的个体生产按照国家要求的方向来发展。这样，就把各种个体经济按照不同情况，采用不同方法，逐步地纳入了国家计划的轨道。
    第三，对资本主义工商业实行利用、限制和改造的政策。在这方面，国家通过各种国家资本主义的形式，并且在税收、价格、活动范围和工人的劳动条件等方面采取了各种措施，使资本主义工商业接受国家的领导，并且逐步地转变为国家资本主义的工商业。这样，也就把它们按照不同情况，采用不同形式，逐步地纳入了国家计划的轨道。
    几年来的实践证明：没有社会主义经济的迅速发展，计划经济是不可能建立起来的；社会主义性质的经济愈强大，我们的计划性就愈增强。但是，我国计划经济的建立过程，不仅决定于作为国民经济主体的社会主义经济的发展，而且在很大程度上决定于对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造的逐步发展。对各种非社会主义经济逐步实行社会主义改造的过程，同时也就是把它们逐步纳入计划轨道的过程。
    第二个方面，就是根据党在过渡时期总路线，结合上述党的各种政策，由国家机关按照适当分工，分别不同情况，采取不同方法和形式来进行计划工作。在我国的国民经济计划中，除社会主义企业的计划外，对其他经济成份的计划，还不能不带有相当大的估算性质。因此，在计划方法上，有的采取直接计划，有的采取间接计划；在计划所根据的资料上，有的采用统计数，有的采用估计数；在计划的范围上，有些生产、建设和事业的主要指标在国家计划中作了具体规定，有些则不作具体规定；在计划工作的分工上，各级计划机关除负责综合平衡外，着重注意直接计划，而在间接计划方面（如农业、手工业和私人工商业），则采取由国务院各办公室、各部和各省（市）、自治区分工管理的办法来进行工作。这种全面计划和分别对待相结合、统一综合和分工管理相结合的方法，基本上是符合于我国的实际情况的。
    我们从一九五一、一九五二年开始制订全国性的、年度的国民经济计划控制数字，从一九五三年开始实施第一个五年计划，并且逐年编制了年度计划。第一个五年计划，体现了党的总路线和各项具体政策，这个计划是正确的，同我国经济情况的发展基本上也是相符合的。其中社会主义改造的步骤较慢，但由于党中央及时地、正确地领导了加速社会主义改造的工作，在实际工作中并没有被原来的规定所束缚。在各个年度计划中，虽然也有某些指标定得偏低或偏高，有些方面照顾得不全面，但执行的结果表明，过去的几个年度计划，大体上还是反映了当年的实际情况、并且起了动员全国人民保证超额完成五年计划的积极作用的。
    总的看来，在党中央和各级党委的领导下，各个经济部门和各级计划机关，经过几年来的共同努力，克服了各种困难，边学边做，工作是有成绩的。主要是把我国国民经济的各方面和各种经济成份，逐步地、有区别地纳入了国家计划的轨道，并且为我国的计划经济建立了基础，胜利地执行了第一个五年计划。
    提高计划工作水平的三个问题
    但是，在过去的计划工作中，缺点和错误是不少的。最主要的缺点，就是我们的计划工作还不全面、不准确、不灵活和缺乏远见。这些缺点，集中地反映了我们在编制计划中的主观认识和客观实际的不相适应。为了克服我们工作中的缺点和错误，提高计划工作的水平，我想根据过去几年计划工作的经验教训，主要讲一讲以下三个问题。
    掌握国民经济发展的客观规律
    （一）通过系统地了解和研究中国经济情况的办法，来进一步认识和掌握经济发展的客观规律。
    要作好计划工作，必须深入实际深入群众，切实作好调查研究工作，摸清中国经济情况和它的发展趋势，摸清各地区各方面经济上的特点，掌握编制计划的确切根据。在这方面，国家计划委员会是做得很不够的。国家计划委员会过去因为兼管长期计划和年度计划，并且曾经一度兼管工业行政和基本建设工作，所以往往忙于编制和修改计划，忙于日常的经济事务，缺乏系统的调查研究，缺乏远见，容易为某些一时的、局部的现象所影响。对经济发展的客观规律，特别是过渡时期的经济特点研究得不够。计划下达得迟、变得多。对各地方的不同特点、特殊要求和地区经济的发展情况，也缺乏深入的了解，加上在编制计划和解决国民经济中的某些重要问题的时候走群众路线不够，因而就不能不犯主观主义和官僚主义的错误。一九五五年确定增加小型钢材和水泥的出口问题，一九五六年的双轮双铧犁问题和其他问题，就是这种错误的具体表现。
    为了克服上述缺点，各级计划机关和各个经济部门除了加强马克思列宁主义的学习，特别是政治经济学的学习以外，还必须加强对基层情况的了解，加强对经济发展趋势的系统的调查研究，进一步摸清各部门、各地区当前的和长远的需要，摸清国民经济中的潜在力量和薄弱环节，分析各种技术经济定额的执行情况，总结和推广生产建设中的各种先进经验。只有这样，才能取得计算需要和可能的确实根据，为计划的综合平衡建立起可靠的基础。
    党中央和国务院今年决定把长期计划和年度计划分为两个机构来管理，这是必要的，是有助于计划工作的深入实际的。为了把计划做好，长期计划工作和年度计划工作必须密切结合，互相补充。长期计划要稳妥可靠，并且要为年度计划规划出一个比较恰当的发展方向和轮廓，在逐年平衡的基础上规定分年的指标。在规定分年指标的时候，应该考虑到未来年度中可能出现的新情况和新问题，并且保留一定的后备力量，以便于年度计划的安排。年度计划则应该更加深入具体地根据当年的实际情况，考虑到每个年度和上下年度间的互相衔接，挖掘各方面的潜力，对长期计划的分年指标进行适当的调整，保证逐年实现和超额完成长期计划所规定的任务。同时，必须特别注意：在经济情况顺利的时候，要充分估计到困难的一面，不要冲昏头脑；而在困难的时候，又要估计到有利的条件，不要吓昏头脑。这样，才能使长期计划和年度计划都具有远见而又符合当前情况，才有可能少犯或不犯冒进或者保守的错误。
    但是，不论长期计划或年度计划，都不可能完全预计到经济生活中可能出现的一切新情况和新问题。因之，为了使计划更加符合于实际，更能对经济的发展起指导作用，就必须深入检查计划的执行情况，依靠群众，不断地发现和解决新的问题，从实际生活的发展中来补充和修改原来的认识，再拿提高了的认识反过来指导计划的调整和编制。这样，就有可能逐步增长我们的远见，帮助我们掌握经济发展的客观规律。
    掌握有计划按比例发展的规律
    （二）加强综合平衡、全面安排的工作，掌握有计划按比例发展的规律。
    国民经济的各方面是一个有机地结合着的整体，是互相影响和互相制约的，任何一方面的过分突出或过分落后，都会引起比例关系的失调，妨碍整个国民经济的发展。因此，计划工作必须从逐步克服上述第一个缺点中做到“心中有数”，保持客观的、全面的态度，研究事物的内在联系，掌握有计划、按比例发展的规律，作好综合平衡和全面安排的工作；这也就是各级计划机关的基本职责。
    在这方面，国家计划委员会过去同样也是做得很不够的。在实际工作中，我们对中央国营工业注意较多，对地方工业，农业、商业、文教事业和其他方面注意不够；甚至有些应该管的事也没有管，而有些不应该管的事却又管了。总之，综合平衡工作做得不够，研究不够，在某些问题上就容易产生片面观点和局部观点，或者在计划的指导上产生自流现象。比如在过去，当农业的发展落后于人民消费和国家建设的需要的时候，就没有能提出有效的办法来克服；在沿海和内地的关系上，对沿海工业的充分、合理的利用注意得不够；在工资、劳动生产率和生活供应这三者之间的关系上，曾有一个时期安排得不够恰当，出了一些偏差；一九五六年的基本建设计划，因为物资平衡工作做得不好，使建设工程的需要和材料供应的可能之间产生了若干脱节现象，加以在计划的执行过程中控制不够，引起了经济上和财政上不应有的紧张。以上这些具体问题，虽然已经党中央和国务院指示解决，但今后仍然应该经常注意；否则，就会使国家的经济建设工作遭受更大的损失。
    为了克服上述缺点，必须认真加强综合平衡、全面安排的工作。不仅要对国民经济中互相关联的各个方面进行综合平衡、全面安排，也就是说，不仅在工业和农业、生产和流通、生产建设和交通运输、经济和财政、积累和消费、劳动和工资、成本和物价、生产和分配、物资供应和物资储备、经济和文教、经济文教建设和国防行政、中央和地方以及各民族、各地区等各有关方面之间，都要进行综合平衡和全面安排；而且在国民经济中每一个方面和每一个地区的本身，也都需要进行综合平衡和全面安排。以工业来说，就需要在重工业和轻工业之间、重工业内部、轻工业内部、各产业相互之间、原料工业和加工工业之间、生产和建设之间、建设规模和地质资源之间、供产销之间、原有工业和新建工业之间、沿海工业和内地工业之间、中央工业和地方工业之间、国营工业和公私合营工业之间、大小企业相互配合之间，以及工业建设和城市建设之间进行综合平衡和全面安排。这确实是一件千头万绪、错综复杂的细致工作，稍不注意，就容易顾此失彼，犯片面性的错误。
    因此，要作好这一工作，第一，必须以党的总路线和各项方针政策为依据，使重点和全面相结合。忽视重点或削弱重点的平均主义思想、只顾重点不顾其它的孤立主义思想和过分强调一个方面、一个地区的局部思想，都是同党的方针政策相违背的，对国民经济的有计划的发展都是有害的。
    第二，必须注意正确的掌握国民经济有计划按比例发展的规律。比例关系是有其一定的规律的，而且是必须根据我国的具体情况来规定的。但是，所定的比例，并不是呆板的公式，在不同的经济情况下必然有程度不同的比例。只有根据实际的需要和可能，进行反复的平衡计算，才能比较恰当的规定出国民经济各方面的比例关系，而且要在实践中加以修正补充。
    第三，必须从积极的、发展的观点出发。在经济生活中，平衡是相对的，克服了旧的不平衡，又会出现新的不平衡，实际生活正是在平衡和不平衡的矛盾中发展的。我们的责任，就是要从发展的观点出发，采取积极的措施，不断地发现和克服新的薄弱环节，克服新的不平衡，使整个国民经济一步一步地走向新的高涨。
    第四，还必须采取统一领导，分工协作的办法。中央的计划机构负责全国的、全面的综合平衡；各地区和各部门的计划机构同样必须认真地加强自己的综合平衡工作，加强全局观点，改善综合平衡的方法。使地区的、部门的综合平衡同国家的、全面的综合平衡有机地结合起来。
    改善计划工作的体制和方法
    （三）适应新的情况，按照集中统一和因地制宜相结合的原则，来改善计划工作的体制和方法。
    计划工作对于我国来说完全是一门新的业务，必须虚心地、系统地向苏联和各兄弟国家学习，善于把各兄弟国家的先进经验同中国的实际情况结合起来。几年来，我们在向苏联和各兄弟国家学习的基础上，规定了一些计划工作的制度、程序、表格和办法，这些规定对于建立我国的计划工作来说是必要的，基本上也是适用的。在这方面，各兄弟国家、特别是苏联的计划工作经验，帮助我们少走了许多的弯路。我们的缺点是还学习得不够，还不善于把国家计划的统一性同因时因地因事制宜的灵活性结合起来，也没有及时地根据情况的变化来改善计划工作的体制。比如，在国家计划中没有恰当地规定分级管理的范围，也没有规定各部门各地区在一定范围内的机动调剂余地；某些基本建设工程的投资限额规定得过低；某些设计任务书的审批程序有一个时期规定得过于集中；某些表格指标规定得过于繁琐；因此就使各部门各地方和基层企业的积极性和创造性受到了一定的束缚。这种管得过多过死的毛病是必须克服的。
    我国当前的经济情况是社会主义改造已经取得决定性的胜利，社会主义建设已经由于第一个五年计划的胜利执行而形成新的高涨。为了适应这一新的情况，计划体制和计划方法必须作适当的改变，使我们的计划工作更符合于调动一切积极因素来加速社会主义建设的这个总的要求。必须使计划中由国家掌握的、具有重大国民经济意义的各项主要指标能够增强其对经济活动的指导作用；使地方和部门掌握的各项指标能够具有较大的灵活性，以便更好地发挥各部门各地方和各基层企业的积极性，保证计划的提前和超额完成。
    因此，在计划体制上，就需要实行分级管理。分级管理的原则是既要照顾到集中统一，又要照顾到因地制宜。凡需要全国统一平衡的各项重要指标，由国家计划委员会、国家经济委员会综合平衡、并报国务院批准后列入国家计划，由国务院统一下达；地方性的、局部性的、属于地区平衡或者各部门自行平衡的各项指标，则由各省（市）、自治区或各部门因事、因地制宜地自行平衡和安排，同时应报国务院备案，以便经过综合、纳入国家计划；其他许多次要的、种类繁多而情况又不易掌握、因而无法一一纳入国家计划的指标，则由地方或者各基层单位自行安排，国家只从大的方面加以筹划，并从价格政策、供销关系上加以调节。凡纳入国家计划中的各项指标，可以分为三种，即指令性的指标、可以调整的指标和参考性的指标。各部门和各地区如要修改指令性的指标，必须经国务院批准；可以调整的指标，则可以在国务院规定的一定范围、一定幅度内自行调整。适应上述办法，计划和统计工作的制度、程序和表格中某些已经过时的、不适当的规定，应该尽快地研究修改。
    加强各级党委对计划工作的领导
    为了迅速提高计划工作的水平，我们要求各级党委加强对计划工作的领导。计划工作是我国进行社会主义建设和实行计划经济的一项重要而又繁重的工作，也是各级党委为了加强对社会主义建设的全面领导所必须掌握的一个重要环节。因之，我们要求各级党委健全计划机构，加强计划工作人员的政策思想和全面观点，提高他们的理论水平和科学知识，注意防止计划机关陷入单纯计算或者日常事务的小圈子，教育所有的计划工作人员走群众路线，帮助他们加强同科学家、专家、先进生产者和先进工作者的联系，从深入实际、研究问题中来培养计划工作的能力，逐步地使计划工作者成为能够掌握党的政策、熟悉计划业务和密切联系群众的计划经济专家。同时，也要相应地改进和加强统计工作。
    现在，党中央已经向第八次全国代表大会提出了“关于发展国民经济的第二个五年计划的建议”，我认为这个建议是正确的恰当的，各级计划机关当前的任务，就是要协同各经济部门、各地方根据这个建议来编好第二个五年计划。我们相信，在党的第八次全国代表大会的号召下，在党中央和毛泽东同志的正确领导下，依靠全党和全国人民的力量，我们兢兢业业工作，这个任务是一定能够完成的。而且，只要我们善于调动国内的一切积极因素，加上苏联和其他兄弟国家的支援，第二个五年计划的建议中所规定的各项任务，也是一定能够胜利完成的。
