Henan Youth in Xinjiang

Li Hun

When the Henan youth volunteer reclamation team first arrived in Xinjiang, it was the season when cotton in the Manas River basin was budding and wheat was ripening.

In early July, I went to the Ula Us Farm to participate in the wheat harvest. When I entered the wheat field of the First Production Team, I was mesmerized by the more than 3,000 mu of golden wheat in front of me. It was truly a sea of wheat, and the combine harvesters, with their constantly flapping wings, cruised through this golden ocean like warships. Several young men wearing baggy blue trousers and tight-fitting small jackets working on the combine harvesters were particularly eye-catching. They were the young farmers from Gongxian County, Henan, who had recently arrived in Xinjiang and were now operating machinery, participating in Xinjiang's first harvest.

During my stay in the First Team, I got to know many reclamation farmers from Henan. They had already become good friends with the veteran soldiers and veteran comrades. The veteran comrades cared for them like younger brothers and sisters, some giving up their quilts and shoes for the new comrades to use, and others introducing the farm's development over the years to the new owners. Zhang Zhongtai, the squad leader, used his own money to buy many daily necessities and distributed them to the new comrades in his squad. They felt as warm as if they were at home. These young women and lads were also as capable as tigers and dragons in their work. Once, I was returning from the wheat field and passed by the alfalfa field, where I saw ten or so young women following behind a horse-drawn harvester, bundling alfalfa. One little girl was in charge of the largest area. Her dark red, round face was covered in sweat, and the small flowered handkerchief hanging on her left lapel was already soaked. But she kept smiling, holding a large sickle in her hand, constantly walking from one side to the other, her two small hands skillfully and quickly bundling the alfalfa. When others couldn't keep up, she would automatically help them. When someone was thirsty, she would bring them boiled water. She seemed to be taking care of others like an older sister. Later, I learned that her name was Zhang Jinzhen, and she was only eighteen years old this year. After graduating from senior elementary school in her hometown, she didn't pass the entrance exam for middle school and participated in production at home. This time, she came to the frontier with her sister, and the two sisters were assigned to work in the same team. In the initial labor life, this girl, who grew up in a poor peasant family, won people's love with her optimistic nature and diligent hands.

These young frontier builders have deeply fallen in love with this good place in the Manas River. Wu Yuezhong, a member of the Communist Youth League working in the threshing ground, is only nineteen years old. When he heard the call from the Party and the government to reclaim land in the frontier in his village in Gongxian County, he was among the first to sign up. His old grandfather cried and advised him not to leave his native land, but he persuaded his grandfather and, encouraged by his father (a Communist Party member), came to Xinjiang with his lover, Baohua. Wu Yuezhong had not participated in field labor since graduating from elementary school, and he was inevitably a little unaccustomed to the labor on the farm at first. But now, seeing the neatly planned crop rotation areas of the Xinjiang farm, seeing the straight channels and green shelterbelts around the fields, and seeing the tractors roaring in the green cotton fields... he couldn't help but think: This is truly the life that our peasants have yearned for day and night! He worked very energetically in the tasks of drying, winnowing, and loading grain. His hands were blistered, calluses grew, and his face was tanned, and his nature became more active. He and his lover quietly planned their little life. After receiving their first month's salary, after buying some necessary miscellaneous items, they saved forty yuan. They agreed to save money every month in the future, preparing to build a prosperous and happy small family in the frontier.

I also met Communist Party member Su Xiuye on the threshing floor. He was originally the secretary of the village's Communist Youth League branch. This nineteen-year-old, big, dark young man was the most talkative and particularly strong person. When loading grain onto trucks, a hundred-odd-pound bag on his shoulder was nothing. After carrying dozens of bags, his face didn't change color, and he didn't run out of breath, still talking and laughing, making his companions laugh. Such a person is as valuable as a pearl, put him anywhere, and he will shine there.

One noon, the instructor of the First Team and I were walking back along the channel by the field, and we were met by someone walking in a hurry, wearing a straw hat, with a coat draped over his left shoulder, and carrying a sickle in his right hand. The instructor quietly told me: He is Li Yurun. His face is round, with a pair of dark and bright eyes. The instructor said that one day when he was inspecting the work in the field, he saw Li Yurun working with particular intensity. He cut one piece with a swishing sound, and then hurried to another piece of land, regardless of how fierce the sunshine on the July grassland was, he kept waving the Soviet-style large sickle. His clothes were soaked with sweat, and the wheat awns pierced his hands, but he didn't care. Every day when he went to work, he walked in front, carrying a sickle in one hand and a water bottle in the other, striding vigorously to the field, completely like an old master of this grassland. Li Yurun had only arrived from Gongxian County, Henan, more than twenty days ago. His lover, Du Shuying, is also an outstanding person. Her first working day after coming to the farm happened to be "removing the trouser legs" of the cotton plants. In the first few days, like others, she was so tired that her back and legs ached every day, and she only managed to strip six or seven fen of land. None of them reached the quota of three mu; but after a few days, Zhang Jinzhen reached six mu and eight fen, and Du Shuying broke the record of eight mu. She and Li Yurun had just gotten married in their hometown when they set off for Xinjiang. The woman is a Party member, and the man is a member of the Communist Youth League. They are truly a happy young couple. Now they have moved into a beautiful small house...

These young farmers have dedicated their most precious youth to the frontier construction cause. Among them, I don't know how many people will become production experts like Liu Xuefo, Zhang Hongkui, and Pan Dayong [note]; the vast and fertile land of the Manas River basin will always be suitable for those strong and diligent people to take root and blossom!

[Note] Liu Xuefo - a famous cotton planting expert who created a high-yield record of 1,392.86 jin of cotton per mu in the Manas River basin.
Zhang Hongkui - an excellent tractor driver on a Xinjiang farm, and a team leader who completed two and a half years of tasks in one year.
Pan Dayong - a famous corn expert who created a high-yield record of 1,544 jin of corn per mu.

    河南青年在新疆
    李魂
    河南青年志愿垦荒队刚来到新疆的时候，正是玛纳斯河流域棉花现蕾、小麦灌浆的季节。
    7月初，我到乌拉乌苏农场去参加麦收工作。我走进第一生产队的麦田，就被眼前三千多亩金黄色的小麦迷住了。这真是麦海，那不停扇动着翅膀的联合收割机像舰艇似地驰行在这金黄色的海洋里。在联合收割机上工作的有几个穿着肥短的蓝裤和紧瘦的小褂的青年，特别引人注意。他们就是不久前来到新疆的河南巩县的青年农民，如今已经走上机车，参加新疆的第一次收获了。
    我在一队逗留期间，认识了不少来自河南的垦荒农民。他们已经和老战士、老同志们成了好朋友。老同志们像爱护弟弟妹妹一样爱护他们，有的让出自己的被子、鞋子给新同志用，有的向新主人们介绍了几年来农场的发展情况。班长张忠泰用自己的钱买了许多生活用具，分给班里的新同志。他们感到像在家里一样温暖。这些年青的妇女和小伙子在工作中也像生龙活虎似地能干。有一次我从麦地回来，路过苜蓿地，看到十来个女青年正跟在马拉收割机后面捆苜蓿，有一个小姑娘管了最大一块面积。她的黑红色的圆脸上汗淋淋的，挂在左襟上的小花手绢已经湿透了。但她的脸上一直微笑着，手里握着大镰刀，不停地从这一边走到另一边，两只小手熟练、迅速地把苜蓿捆起来。别人捆不过来时她就自动去帮助，有人口渴了，她就把开水提到跟前。她好像是一个大姐一样关照着别人。后来我才知道她的名字叫张金珍，今年只有十八岁。她在家乡读完高小后没考上中学，在家里参加了生产，这次和她的姐姐一块来到了边疆，姐妹俩都被分配在一个队上工作。在最初的劳动生活中，这个在贫农家庭长大的姑娘，就以她的乐观的性情，勤劳的双手，博得了人们的喜爱。
    这些年青的边疆建设者已经深深地爱上了玛纳斯河这个好地方。在麦场里工作的青年团员吴曰忠，只有十九岁。当他在巩县乡村听到党和政府提出到边疆垦荒的号召时，就争先报了名。他的老爷爷哭着劝他不要离开乡土，但是他说服了爷爷，在他父亲（共产党员）的鼓励下，和爱人保花一道来到新疆。吴曰忠从小学毕业以来，一直没参加过田间劳动，开始在农场的劳动中未免有些不习惯，但现在他看到新疆农场规划得整整齐齐的轮作区，看到条田周围笔直的渠道和绿色防护林带，看到在绿油油的棉田里轰鸣着的拖拉机……心里不禁想：这真是咱农民日夜向往的生活啊！在晒场、扬场、装运等工作中他干得很起劲，手上起了血泡，长了硬茧，脸也晒黑了，他的性情变得更活跃了。他和爱人悄悄地筹划起小日子来，第一个月领到工资后，除去买了些应用杂物，还存起了四十元。他们商量好今后月月储蓄，准备在边疆建立一个丰足、欢乐的小家庭。
    我认识共产党员苏秀叶也是在麦场上。他原是村里的团支部书记。这个十九岁的黑大个子青年，是个最爱说笑而且特别有力气的人。在往汽车上装粮食的时候，百十斤重的口袋放在他肩上不算啥，几十口袋扛过了仍是面不改色、气不上喘，还不住地谈笑，引得伙伴们笑个不住。这样的人真像珍珠一样的可贵，放在那儿，就在那儿发光。
    一天中午，我和一队指导员沿着田边渠道往回走，迎面急匆匆地走来一个人，他头戴草帽，左肩披一件外衣，右手提着一张镰刀。指导员悄声告诉我：他就是李玉闰。他的脸园园的，长着一对黑而有神的眼睛。指导员说，有一天他在地里检查工作，就看到李玉闰特别紧张地工作着，他沙沙沙地割完一块，又急忙赶到另一块地里，不管7月草原上的日照有多么厉害，他又不停手地挥舞起苏联式的大镰刀割起来，汗湿透了衣服，麦芒刺破了手，他都不顾。每天上工，他都走在前头，一手提着镰刀，一手提着水壶，迈着健壮的步子赶往田里，完全像这草原上的老主人。李玉闰是二十多天以前才由河南巩县来的。他的爱人杜淑英也是个出色的人物。她来场后第一个工作日正赶上给棉花“脱裤腿”，开初几天，她和别人一样，每天累得腰酸腿疼才只脱了六、七分地，她们没有一个人达到三亩的定额；但过了几天，张金珍达到了六亩八，杜淑英就突破了八亩的纪录。她和李玉闰在家乡刚结婚就启程到新疆来了。女的是党员，男的是团员，他俩真是一对幸福的年青人。现在他们已经搬进一所漂亮的小房子里居住了……。
    这些青年农民们，把自己最珍贵的青春献给了边疆建设事业。在他们中间不知有多少人，将会成为像刘学佛、张鸿魁、潘大勇（注）那样的生产能手；辽阔而肥美的玛纳斯河流域的土地，永远适宜于那些坚强、勤劳的人们生根、开花！
    〔注〕　刘学佛——在玛纳斯河流域创造了棉花每亩产一千三百九十二点八六斤丰产纪录的著名植棉能手。
    张鸿魁——新疆农场的优秀拖拉机手，一年完成两年半任务的机车组长。
    潘大勇——创造玉米每亩产一千五百四十四斤丰产纪录的著名玉米丰产能手。
