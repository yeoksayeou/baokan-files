The editorial department of Sichuan Worker's Daily

    Not long ago, the Sichuan Worker's Daily received a letter from a reader reflecting the harsh living conditions and weak political work of the workers at the Yibin Tea Factory.

    The letter stated: The Yibin Tea Factory has over four hundred female tea pickers, but not even one female dormitory. The female workers have to find housing on their own. The factory is located across the Jinsha River from Yibin city, but over a hundred female workers live in Yibin city and have to get up at four o'clock every morning to rush to the river to wait for a boat. In summer, the Jinsha River often floods. When the flood comes, traffic is interrupted, and the situation is even worse. Sometimes, these hundred plus female workers are stuck in the city by the flood and cannot go to work for several days, unable to earn piece-rate wages, causing difficulties for their families. After the flood recedes, they rush to the factory and have to work overtime to catch up on tasks. Sometimes, these hundred plus female workers are stuck at the factory and cannot return home, and they have to find a temporary place to sleep in the corner of the factory, using sacks of raw tea as mattresses and sacks of raw tea as blankets; even then, they are as crowded as sardines in a can. Some mothers, worried about their children being unattended at home, cry incessantly.

    The Yibin Tea Factory not only lacks a female dormitory but also a medical clinic, a female bathhouse, and even facilities for female workers to wash their faces and hands.

    The letter also stated: The political work here is shockingly weak. Among the factory's five hundred plus male and female workers, there is only one Party member, who was recruited two years ago. Among the four hundred plus female workers, nearly two hundred are young workers, but there is not even one member of the Communist Youth League. In the first half of this year, the workers have not even heard a single political report. Many people are unclear about things like the upsurge of socialist transformation.

    Based on the issues raised by the reader, the Sichuan Worker's Daily sent a reporter to the Yibin Tea Factory to investigate. Why hasn't the Yibin Tea Factory built even one female dormitory after four years of operation? Does the factory really not have the money to build a simple female bathhouse and install ordinary face and hand washing facilities? Where has the factory's political work gone? What are the Party branch, Youth League branch, and trade union doing?

    The investigation revealed that the factory is not entirely without funds. The enterprise reward fund has a surplus of more than 1,700 yuan, the medical expenses fund has a surplus of more than 2,500 yuan, and the administration also has more than 1,200 yuan, which should be used to subsidize workers with financial difficulties, but in the first half of this year, not a single worker received any subsidy.

    Carrying this information, the reporter went to interview Comrade Su Shilin, the factory director and Party branch secretary of the Yibin Tea Factory. When Comrade Su Shilin heard that the reporter had come to the factory to investigate, he was not only unfazed but even pleasantly surprised. He told the reporter that his work indeed had many shortcomings and then eagerly began to complain. In summary, Comrade Su Shilin's difficulties were fourfold:

    First, these problems are reported to higher authorities every year, but no one ever resolves them. This year, the Sichuan Provincial Tea Company approved an expansion plan, including the installation of new machines and the construction of new warehouses; however, the construction of dormitories was still not approved. Seeing that the floods are coming again this year, the factory submitted a report requesting the construction of a temporary shed costing only 900 yuan to temporarily solve the female workers' difficulties. The report has been submitted for two months, but there is still no response.

    Second, the factory is not only responsible for production but also for the acquisition of raw tea. Therefore, the factory has acquisition stations in various counties of the Yibin Prefecture. The factory director has to manage the factory and go to the acquisition stations; coupled with inconvenient transportation, the round trip to the more distant acquisition stations takes five or six days on foot, and with frequent meetings to attend, the factory director can only be at the factory for half a month out of the month.

    Third, the factory's Party branch is under the direct leadership of the Yibin Prefectural and District-level organs, and the Party's work is arranged according to the organs' standards. They have never assigned guidance about how the factory's political work should be done.

    Fourth, they do not receive instructions on political work from the higher-level Party committee, and what about the two higher-level administrative organs? The Sichuan Provincial Tea Company only manages commerce and rarely assigns enterprise management work; the Yibin Prefectural Purchasing Bureau also only manages purchasing and not enterprise management. Factory Director and Party Branch Secretary Su Shilin does not receive help from higher authorities and has not found a way to approach the factory's political and economic work, and does not even know the economic authority of the factory director.

    When Comrade Su Shilin saw the reporter off, he repeatedly urged: "Your newspaper should criticize us quickly! This way, the problem will be resolved." "Please appeal for us quickly!"

    The workers have difficulties, and the factory director also has difficulties. What should be done? Go to the local Party committee! Thus, the reporter went to the CPC Yibin Prefectural Committee.

    First, they found the Industrial Department of the Prefectural Committee. The comrades in the Industrial Department said: "The Yibin Tea Factory does not belong to industry; it is a non-industrial type of factory. They are under the management of the finance and trade system. You should go to the Finance and Trade Department."

    The reporter went to the Finance and Trade Department of the Prefectural Committee. The comrades in the Finance and Trade Department said: "We only manage the factory's policy and business; we do not manage the workers' lives. The factory's cadres are under the management of the Rural Work Department, so the workers should probably be under their management as well." Thus, the comrades in the Finance and Trade Department led the reporter to the Rural Work Department.

    The comrades in the Rural Work Department of the Prefectural Committee said: "We manage the Party's cadre work. However, because this tea factory has to acquire red tea in the countryside, the cadres are administratively under the management of the Prefectural Purchasing Bureau."

       "Then, do you manage the workers or not?" the reporter asked.

      "This… is not yet clear. You should go to the Prefectural Purchasing Bureau to see how they plan to solve the workers' livelihood problems."

    The reporter had no choice but to leave the CPC Yibin Prefectural Committee and go to the Prefectural Purchasing Bureau.

    Guo Baoren, the Deputy Director of the Purchasing Bureau, received the reporter. He said: "We will definitely urge the factory to solve the problems with the workers' lives."

    How strange! It was precisely because the factory could not solve the workers' livelihood problems that the reporter came to visit the leading organs. Why did Deputy Director Guo's tone seem as if the factory could solve the problems but was not doing so, requiring them to urge them? The reporter asked: "Are there any specific solutions?"

    Deputy Director Guo replied: "See if we can free up a hall or similar space for the workers to live in." The reporter reminded Deputy Director Guo: "The factory has no hall at all!"

      "Then…"

      "Seeing that the floods are coming again, can the Purchasing Bureau approve the temporary construction of a shed for the female workers using other funds from the factory?"

      "The Purchasing Bureau has no right to move the factory's money."

      "Can the Purchasing Bureau take out its own money?"

      "The Purchasing Bureau has no money."

      "Then, according to enterprise management procedures, how should these problems be solved?"

      "We mainly manage the purchase of agricultural products and are not familiar with enterprise management."

    "But how will the problem be solved?"

    Deputy Director Guo promised that they would definitely hold a meeting to "urge them."

    However, who should be urged is unknown. The reporter had no choice but to leave the Prefectural Purchasing Bureau.

    Who should solve these urgent problems? Who should be responsible for the political work and workers' lives at the Yibin Tea Factory? Is it that the problems are unlucky because the Yibin Tea Factory, although a factory, is a non-industrial type of factory? Is the Yibin Tea Factory forever destined to be an "orphaned child"? Is this problem just a general problem of bureaucracy, or does it reflect something else? There are many factories belonging to the commercial system and the agricultural product purchasing system. Is the situation at the Yibin Tea Factory just an isolated phenomenon among them, or is it a more common problem?

    谁是这孩子的妈妈
    四川工人日报编辑部
    不久以前，四川工人日报收到一封读者来信，反映宜宾茶厂的职工生活很苦，政治工作也很薄弱。
    这封来信说：宜宾茶厂有四百多个拣茶女工，竟连一间女工宿舍也没有，女工只能在外面找房子住。这个厂设在宜宾城郊金沙河的对岸，却有一百多个女工住在宜宾城里，每天早上四点钟就要起床，赶到河边去等船。一到夏天，金沙河常发洪水。洪水来到，交通中断，情况更惨。有时，这一百多个女工被洪水挡在城里，一连几天不能上班，拿不到计件工资，家庭生活发生困难；洪水退后，赶到厂里，又不得不加班加点赶任务。有时，这一百多个女工被洪水挡在厂里，回不了家，只得在厂房角落里临时找个地方睡，铺的是装毛茶的麻袋，盖的也是装毛茶的麻袋；就是这样，还挤得像罐头里的沙汀鱼一样。有些当了妈妈的，惦念孩子在家没有人管，哭不成声。
    宜宾茶厂不但没有女工宿舍，而且没有医务室，没有女工澡堂，甚至连给女工洗脸、洗手的设备都没有。
    来信又说：这里的政治工作薄弱到惊人的程度。全厂五百多名男女工人中，只有一个党员，还是两年前发展的。四百多名女工中，有近二百名是青工，可是连一个团员也没有。今年上半年，工人们连一次政治报告也没有听过，什么社会主义改造高潮等，许多人都搞不清楚。
    根据读者反映的这些情况，四川工人日报派了记者到宜宾茶厂去调查。为什么宜宾茶厂建厂四年了，连一间女工宿舍也没有盖呢？难道厂里真的连搭个简陋的女工澡堂，安点普通的洗脸、洗手设备的钱都没有吗？厂里的政治工作到哪里去了？党支部、团支部和工会又在干些什么？
    调查的结果，这个厂里并不是一点钱也没有。企业奖励基金结余了一千七百多元，医药费结余了二千五百多元，行政上也还有一千二百多元钱，应该用来补助生活困难的职工，但今年上半年，没有一个工人得到补助。
    怀了这笔账，记者去访问宜宾茶厂的厂长兼党支部书记苏世林同志。苏世林同志听说记者下厂来调查，不但面无难色，竟然喜出望外了。他向记者表示自己的工作确实有许多缺点，接着就迫不及待地诉起苦情来。归纳起来，苏士林同志的苦处有四：
    第一、这些问题年年往上报，从来没有人解决。今年四川省茶业公司批来扩建计划，又是安装新机器，又是修建新仓库；至于修宿舍还是没有批准。眼看今年的洪水又来了，厂里又打报告要求搭一个只花九百元的席篷，暂时解决一下女工的困难，报告递上去两个月了，还是没有答复。
    第二、厂里不只管生产，还要管毛茶收购。因此，厂里在宜宾专区各个县都设有收购站。一个厂长又要管厂里，又要下收购站；加上交通不便，远点的收购站来回步行要五、六天，外带经常出去开会，厂长一个月只能有半个月的时间在厂里。
    第三、厂里的党支部，属宜宾地、专一级机关直属党委领导，布置党的工作却按机关的一套来布置。从来没有布置过工厂的政治工作怎么做。
    第四、从上级党委，得不到政治工作的指示，而两个上级行政机关呢？四川省茶业公司只管商业，很少布置企业管理工作；宜宾专区采购局也是只管采购，不管企业管理。厂长兼支部书记苏世林同志得不到上级的帮助，对工厂的政治工作和经济工作都没有摸到门，甚至连厂长在经济上有多大职权都搞不清楚。
    苏世林同志送别记者时，一再叮嘱：“你们报纸赶快批评我们吧！这样问题就好解决了。”“赶快替我们呼吁呼吁吧！”
    工人有苦处，厂长也有苦处，怎么办呢？找当地党委吧！于是，记者到中共宜宾地委会去。
    先找到地委工业部。工业部的同志说：“宜宾茶厂不属于工业，是非工业类型的工厂。它们归财贸系统管，你到财贸部去吧。”
    记者到了地委财贸部。财贸部的同志说：“我们只管这个厂的政策业务，工人生活不归我们管。这个厂的干部是归农村工作部管的，因此工人大概也该由他们管。”于是，财贸部的同志领着记者到农村工作部去。
    地委农村工作部的同志说：“党的干部工作是我们管的。可是，因为这个茶厂要在农村收购红茶，干部在行政上归专区采购局管。”
       “那末，工人你们管不管呢？”记者问。
      “这个……现在还不明确。你到专区采购局去吧，看工人生活问题，他们准备怎么解决？”
    记者只好离开中共宜宾地委会，来到专区采购局。
    采购局郭宝仁副局长接见了记者，他说：“厂里工人生活上的问题，我们一定督促解决。”
    真是奇怪呵！正是因为工人生活问题厂里没法解决，记者才来跑领导机关。怎么听郭副局长的口气好像厂里能够解决不去解决，才需要他们督促呢？记者就问：“有没有具体办法呢？”
    郭副局长答道：“看看是不是可以腾出礼堂一类的房子给工人住。”　记者提醒郭副局长说：“厂里根本没有礼堂呵！”
      “那……”
      “眼看洪水又来了，采购局是不是可以批准用厂里其他款项暂时搭个席棚给女工住呢？”
      “采购局没有权利动厂里的钱。”
      “采购局自己是不是可以拿出钱来呢？”
      “采购局没有钱。”
      “那末，按照企业管理的手续，这些问题该怎么解决？”
      “我们主要是管农产品采购业务，对企业管理也不熟悉。”
    “可是，问题究竟怎么解决呢”？
    郭副局长答应他们一定开会“督促督促”。
    然而该督促的对象究竟是谁呢？不得而知。记者又只好离开了专区采购局。
    这些迫切的问题究竟该谁解决？宜宾茶厂的政治工作和工人生活，究竟该谁负责？难道说问题就倒霉在宜宾茶厂虽是个工厂，却又是个非工业类型的工厂吗？难道宜宾茶厂永远只能是个“没娘的孩子”吗？这个问题究竟只是一般的官僚主义问题，或者还是反映出别的甚么问题呢？像这种属于商业系统和农产品采购系统的工厂还很不少，宜宾茶厂的情况，在它们中间，究竟只是个别现象，还是个比较普遍的问题呢？
