Xinhua News Agency, August 31st. All members and staff of the Sino-Soviet Joint Mountaineering Team were awarded prizes tonight in Beijing by the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission of the People's Republic of China and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions.

Vice Premier of the State Council and Director of the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission, He Long, and Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Lai Ruoyu, presented medals and bonuses to the heroes who conquered Muztagh Ata at a celebration attended by over a thousand people.

At 7:30 PM, when the thirty-one members and thirteen staff of the Sino-Soviet Joint Mountaineering Team entered the venue, the attendees rose to their feet and applauded for over two minutes.

Lai Ruoyu said at the celebration that the young Chinese mountaineers, under the guidance of experienced Soviet mountaineers, have created a new record in the history of Chinese mountaineering. The Chinese athletes, who were previously employees and workers in different positions, have achieved this mountaineering victory through their willingness to learn and their strong will. He said that Muztagh Ata is not the highest mountain in China, and Chinese mountaineers should not be proud but should achieve even greater accomplishments on the existing foundation.

In his speech, Lai Ruoyu thanked the Soviet athletes for their help and the strong support of the People's Committee of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, the local troops, and people of all ethnic groups.

Vice Director of the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission, Cai Shufan, also spoke at the celebration. He said that mountaineering is one of the forty-six sports that China is currently developing. The State Physical Culture and Sports Commission has received letters from many employees, workers, and students from all over the country, requesting help in developing mountaineering, and hopes that Chinese mountaineers can play a role in developing mass mountaineering activities.

The short and sturdy captain of the Sino-Soviet Joint Mountaineering Team, Berezhnoi, spoke at the meeting. He said that the mountaineers of China and the Soviet Union did not forget for a minute the task entrusted to them by the people of the two countries – to reach the summit of Muztagh Ata. When the situation for the Chinese and Soviet team members became increasingly difficult, the team members heard encouraging voices from distant Beijing and Moscow on the radio. On July 31, Chinese and Soviet mountaineers finally created a new record in the history of world mountaineering - thirty-one members collectively and safely climbed to the summit of this mountain, which had never been imprinted by human footprints. The national flags of China and the Soviet Union flew for the first time at a height of 7,546 meters above sea level in southwestern Xinjiang, China.

The deputy captain of the Sino-Soviet Joint Mountaineering Team, Shi Zhanchun, expressed his heartfelt gratitude on behalf of the Chinese mountaineers for the help of the Soviet mountaineers. Shi Zhanchun said that Chinese athletes will summarize the experience of this mountaineering expedition and contribute to the development of mass mountaineering activities.

Xinhua News Agency, August 31st. Vice Premier of the State Council and Director of the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission, He Long, received all members and staff of the Sino-Soviet Joint Mountaineering Team tonight. After the meeting, He Long took pictures with the mountaineering team members and staff.

Those present at the reception included Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Lai Ruoyu, and Vice Director of the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission, Cai Tingkai, and others.

Also present at the reception were the Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of the Soviet Embassy in China, Li Haiqiu, and his wife.

    贺龙接见中、苏混合爬山队全体队员
    新华社31日讯　中、苏混合爬山队全体队员和工作人员今天晚上在北京受到中华人民共和国体育运动委员会和中华全国总工会的奖励。
    国务院副总理、体育运动委员会主任贺龙和中华全国总工会主席赖若愚，在一个有一千多人参加的庆祝会上，分别把奖章和奖金赠给征服慕士塔格山的英雄们。
    晚上七点半钟，当三十一名中、苏混合爬山队队员和十三名工作人员进入会场的时候，到会的人全体起立，鼓掌欢呼两分多钟。
    赖若愚在庆祝会上说，年轻的中国爬山运动员在有经验的苏联爬山运动员的指导下，这一次创造了中国爬山运动史上的新纪录。中国运动员在不久以前还是不同岗位上的职员和工人，虚心学习和坚强的意志使他们取得了这次爬山胜利的成就。他说，慕士塔格山不是中国最高的山，中国爬山运动员不应当骄傲，要在现有的基础上取得更新的成就。
    赖若愚在讲话中，感谢苏联运动员的帮助和新疆维吾尔自治区人民委员会和当地驻军以及各族人民的有力支援。
    体育运动委员会副主任蔡树藩也在庆祝会上讲了话。他说，爬山运动是中国目前要开展的四十六个运动项目中的一个。体育运动委员会接到了各地许多职员、工人和学生的来信，要求帮助开展爬山运动，希望中国爬山运动员能在开展群众性爬山运动中起作用。
    矮壮结实的中、苏混合爬山队队长别列次基在会上讲话。他说，中、苏两国爬山运动员一分钟也没有忘记两国人民交给他们的任务——一定要爬上慕士塔格山顶。当中、苏队员爬山的处境越来越困难的时候，队员们在无线电中听到了从遥远的北京和莫斯科传来的鼓舞他们的声音。7月31日，中、苏两国爬山运动员终于在世界爬山史中创造了新纪录——三十一名队员集体安全地爬上了这个从未印过人类足迹的山顶。中、苏两国国旗第一次飘扬在中国新疆西南部拔海七千五百四十六公尺的高处。
    中、苏混合爬山队副队长史占春代表中国爬山运动员对苏联爬山运动员的帮助，表示衷心的感谢。史占春说，中国运动员将总结这次爬山的经验，在开展群众性爬山运动中尽一份力量。
