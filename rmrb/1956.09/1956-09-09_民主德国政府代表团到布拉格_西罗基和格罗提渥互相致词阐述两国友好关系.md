Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 8th. The government delegation of the German Democratic Republic, headed by Prime Minister Grotewohl, arrived in Prague by train on the afternoon of September 7th at the invitation of the Czechoslovak government. The delegation will visit Czechoslovakia for five days.

The delegation was welcomed at the station by Czechoslovak government and Communist Party leaders Široký, Novotný, Fierlinger, and others.

Prime Ministers Široký and Grotewohl both gave speeches.

Široký said that the arrival of the German Democratic Republic delegation is a major event for the people of all nationalities in Czechoslovakia. In the past, Czechoslovakia and Germany frequently had conflicts and even constant hostility. Today, our two countries have the most sincere friendly relations. This is a historic turning point in the relationship between the Czechoslovak and German peoples.

In his reply, Grotewohl said that the current relationship between the German Democratic Republic and Czechoslovakia proves that through our joint efforts and desire for cooperation, everything that divided our two peoples in the past has been eliminated. He said: We are determined to do everything in our power to contribute to the cause of maintaining peace and promoting human progress.

Referring to the provocative measures recently taken by the Bonn government—particularly the banning of the German Communist Party—Grotewohl announced that the German people will continue the struggle for liberation and national unification to the very end.
