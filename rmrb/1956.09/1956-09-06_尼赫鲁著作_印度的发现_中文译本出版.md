Xinhua News Agency, 5th. The Chinese translation of Indian Prime Minister Nehru's book "The Discovery of India" was published today by World Knowledge Publishing House.

Nehru wrote a special preface for the Chinese translation. In the preface, he described the long-standing friendship between China and India and praised the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence established by the two countries. He also wrote: "I hope this book will enable the great Chinese people to have some understanding of our country. We cherish the friendship of the great Chinese people, and we hope that our relationship with them will become increasingly close."

This book was written by Nehru twelve years ago, when the Second World War was still raging in most parts of the world, and the author was imprisoned in the colonialists' prison. The book discusses at considerable length the development of ancient Indian culture, the origin of writing, and the development of astronomy, medicine, and a series of other sciences. The book also describes the living conditions of the Indian people in later historical periods, analyzes the situation in India during the period of British colonial rule, and focuses on the struggle of modern India for national independence and liberation, especially the activities of the Indian National Congress.
