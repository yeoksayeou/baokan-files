Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 6th -- The vegetable supply and marketing work in Wuhan City is about to undergo fundamental reform. This is mentioned in the "Plan for Reforming Vegetable Production, Supply and Marketing Work" recently formulated by the Wuhan Municipal People's Committee. Currently, relevant units in Wuhan are holding meetings to study and discuss this plan. Vegetable companies, suburban vegetable production cooperatives, and urban vegetable supply and marketing cooperatives are widely disseminating and studying this plan, and preparing to gradually implement it.

In recent years, the vegetable planting area in the suburbs of Wuhan has been continuously expanding, and the yield per unit area has been continuously increasing. By the second quarter of this year, the vegetables produced in the suburbs have been able to meet 80% of the city's needs. However, because the commercial departments have been too restrictive in supply and marketing work, overemphasizing "unified procurement, unified distribution, and unified pricing," and neglecting the many characteristics of vegetables as a commodity, many shortcomings have arisen in vegetable supply and marketing. For example, because the vegetable company concentrates on the intake and output of vegetables, it increases unnecessary circulation links, making the market supply of vegetables uneven, turning fresh vegetables into stale vegetables, and good vegetables into rotten vegetables. Some vegetable supply and marketing cooperatives and mess halls very close to the vegetable gardens cannot even buy vegetables directly from the vegetable farmers, and must go to service stations or procurement centers in the city. Because the commercial departments have not implemented the policy of high quality for high prices, and the vegetable production cooperatives themselves have some shortcomings, it has caused members to blindly pursue output regardless of quality, resulting in very poor vegetable quality. Because the prices are unreasonable, and the retail sales are implemented with a mix of good and bad, and selection is not allowed, the result is a situation where there is a large backlog on one hand and a shortage of vegetables on the other, which has caused great dissatisfaction among consumers, and has also caused losses to vegetable farmers, vendors, and vegetable companies.

In view of these shortcomings, the new reform plan stipulates that vegetable companies should change the past operating methods of all-inclusive sales and all-inclusive purchases, and restore free transactions. In addition to entering into some supply and marketing contracts with vegetable production cooperatives where possible, vegetable companies should actively encourage various vegetable supply and marketing cooperatives and collective consumer units to directly "link up" with vegetable production cooperatives and enter into supply and marketing or supply contracts. Vegetable supply and marketing cooperatives, floating peddlers, and collective mess halls can all directly purchase vegetables from vegetable production cooperatives. Production cooperatives can also directly retail in any place when necessary, in order to reduce circulation links and maintain the freshness of vegetables. In order to better promote the combination of production and sales and regulate supply and demand, the existing vegetable service stations will be changed into vegetable trading markets, where both contract households and non-contract households can conduct transactions. On the principle of mutual voluntariness, vegetable farmers can also entrust the trading market or supply and marketing cooperatives to sell on their behalf, and vegetable companies can also purchase in the market according to the production and sales situation to regulate market supply. In terms of price, the plan stipulates that the principle of price management in the future is still to stabilize vegetable prices. Within the scope of ensuring the stability of the overall level of vegetable prices, there should be more freedom, and the various reasonable price differences such as high quality for high price, grading and pricing, and maintaining wholesale and retail, regional, sunny and rainy (snowy), seasonal, and quality should be earnestly implemented. Vegetable supply and marketing cooperatives should also allow consumers to choose when retailing, grade and price accordingly, and strictly prohibit the method of forcibly matching good and bad.

After the vegetable supply and marketing methods are changed, the Wuhan agricultural departments will actively help the vegetable production cooperatives improve their management and operations accordingly, arrange the production of suburban vegetables according to the annual, quarterly, and monthly plans put forward by the vegetable companies for the city's needs, strengthen technical guidance, and improve the quality of vegetables.

    武汉市蔬菜供销工作将进行根本改革
    改变包买包卖方式恢复自由成交
    新华社武汉6日电　武汉市的蔬菜供销工作，即将进行根本性的改革。这是武汉市人民委员会最近制定的关于改革蔬菜产供销工作方案中所提到的。目前武汉市有关单位正在集会研究讨论这个方案。蔬菜公司、郊区蔬菜生产合作社和市内菜蔬供销合作社，正在对这个方案进行广泛传达和学习，并且准备逐步实行。
    武汉市郊区的蔬菜种植面积几年来不断扩大，单位面积产量不断提高。到今年第二季度，郊区所产蔬菜已经能够满足全市需要量的80％。但是由于商业部门在供销工作上管的过死，过分强调了“统一收购、统一分配、统一价格”，忽视了蔬菜这一商品的许多特点，使蔬菜供销工作产生了许多缺点。比如，由于蔬菜公司集中吞吐蔬菜，增多了不必要的流转环节，使蔬菜上市量不均衡，鲜菜变成了陈菜，好菜变成了烂菜。有些离菜园很近的菜蔬供销合作社和伙食团也不能就近向菜农买菜，一定要到服务站或市内采购。由于商业部门没有贯彻优质优价的政策，以及蔬菜生产合作社本身存在一些缺点，造成社员盲目追求产量、不顾质量的偏向，菜蔬质量很差。由于价格不合理，零售时又实行好坏搭配，不准挑选，结果造成一面大量积压、一面缺少蔬菜的状况，引起消费者很不满意，同时也使菜农、菜贩、蔬菜公司等几方面都受到损失。
    根据这些缺点，新的改革方案规定，蔬菜公司应当改变过去包卖包买的经营方式，恢复自由成交。蔬菜公司除了在可能条件下同蔬菜生产合作社订立一部分供销合同以外，应该积极鼓励各菜蔬供销合作社和集体消费单位同蔬菜生产合作社直接“挂钩”，订立供销或供应合同。菜蔬供销合作社、浮挑菜贩、集体伙食单位都可以直接向蔬菜生产合作社购买蔬菜，生产合作社在必要时还可以在任何地方直接零售，以减少流转环节，保持蔬菜的鲜嫩。为了更好地促使产销结合，调剂供求关系，现有的蔬菜服务站将改为蔬菜交易市场，合同户和非合同户都可在场内进行交易。在双方自愿的原则下，菜农还可以委托交易市场或供销合作社代销，蔬菜公司也可以根据产销情况，在场内进行收购，调剂市场供应。在价格方面，方案中规定今后价格管理的原则仍然是稳定菜价，在保证菜价总水平稳定的范围以内，要有更多的自由，并应切实贯彻优质优价、分等论价和保持批零、地区、晴雨（雪）、季节、品质等各种合理的差价。菜蔬供销合作社零售时也应允许消费者挑选，分等论价，严格制止好坏硬性搭配的办法。
    改变了蔬菜供销办法以后，武汉市农业部门将积极帮助蔬菜生产合作社相应的改善经营管理，按照蔬菜公司按年、季、月提出全市需要的计划，安排郊区蔬菜的生产，加强技术指导，提高蔬菜质量。
