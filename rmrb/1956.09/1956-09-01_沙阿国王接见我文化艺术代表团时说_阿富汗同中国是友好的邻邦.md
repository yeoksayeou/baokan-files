Xinhua News Agency, Kabul, August 31 – King Zahir Shah of Afghanistan received Ma Hanbing, head of the Chinese Cultural and Artistic Delegation, and all its members on the afternoon of August 29 at the Paghman Royal Garden. Ma Hanbing presented gifts from Chairman Mao Zedong to King Zahir Shah.

During the reception, Ma Hanbing said, "The friendship between China and Afghanistan is deep and has a long history. Between our two countries, there is only a record of peaceful exchanges, and no record of war or hostility. Since the Bandung Conference, exchanges between our two countries have become more frequent. Needless to say, these mutual visits will enhance the friendship between our two governments and peoples, which not only conforms to the interests of our two peoples but is also conducive to world peace. Let us congratulate this friendship on its increasing consolidation and development."

King Zahir Shah said, "The visit of the Cultural and Artistic Delegation will enhance the friendly relations between China and Afghanistan.

Zahir Shah carefully examined the gifts presented to him by Chairman Mao Zedong. He asked the delegation to convey his wishes to Chairman Mao Zedong and said, "I thank him for his help in developing friendly relations and cooperation between China and Afghanistan."

The artists of the delegation performed hand drum dances, plate dances, "Autumn River" and Afghan songs on the lawn. The King, a lover of art, praised Chinese songs and dances. He said: "The delegation's performance has aroused great interest among our people. Chinese art is very close to Afghan art because the two countries have many similarities in lifestyle, feelings, and culture." He said that from the perspective of Asians, he hoped that China would widely introduce Asian art to other countries.

King Zahir Shah continued: "We hope to establish friendly relations with all Asian countries, especially with great China, because we are neighbors, friendly neighbors."

After the performance, the King presented flowers to the artists.

Afterwards, the King invited all those present to a buffet. At the buffet, he repeatedly talked about the friendly relations between China and Afghanistan. Finally, he shook hands with all the members of the delegation and left amidst the warm applause of the delegation members.

    沙阿国王接见我文化艺术代表团时说
    阿富汗同中国是友好的邻邦
    新华社喀布尔31日电　阿富汗国王沙阿8月29日下午在帕格曼皇家花园接见了中国文化艺术代表团团长马寒冰和全体团员。马寒冰代表毛泽东主席向沙阿国王赠送了礼物。
    接见时在座的有中国驻阿富汗大使丁国钰、中国展览团团长王汉民。
    阿富汗方面在座的有：宫廷大臣、矿务和工业大臣、代理教育大臣、皇家宫廷部交际司长、新闻署长。
    马寒冰在受接见时说：“中国和阿富汗之间的友谊是深厚的，而且具有悠久的历史。在我们两国之间，只有和平交往的记录，而从没有战争或是敌对的记录。在万隆会议后，我们两国之间的交往更加频繁了。不用说，这种相互的访问将增进我们两国政府和人民之间的友谊，这不但符合我们两国人民的利益，而且也是有利于世界和平的。让我们祝贺这种友谊日益巩固和发展。”
    沙阿国王说：“文化艺术代表团的访问将增进中国和阿富汗之间的友好关系。我们两国在文化方面的传统关系在很久以前就已经存在。在阿富汗诗歌中就可以找到许多这方面的记录。”他希望这种关系不断加深。
    沙阿仔细地观看了毛泽东主席送给他的礼物，他请代表团转达他对毛泽东主席的祝愿，并且说“我感谢他在发展中国和阿富汗之间的友好关系和合作方面所作的帮助”。
    代表团的艺术家们在草地上表演了手鼓舞、盘舞、秋江和阿富汗歌曲。这位爱好艺术的国王盛赞中国的歌曲和舞蹈。他说：“代表团的表演在我们人民中引起了很大的兴趣。中国的艺术同阿富汗的艺术非常相近，因为两国的生活方式、感情和文化有很多相同之处。”他说，从亚洲人的观点出发，他希望中国将广泛地把亚洲艺术介绍给别的国家。
    沙阿国王继续说：“我们希望同一切亚洲国家，特别是同伟大的中国，建立友好关系，因为我们是邻邦，是友好的邻邦。”
    表演后，国王把花赠送给艺术家们。
    随后国王请全体在座的人参加冷餐会。他在冷餐会上一再谈到中国和阿富汗之间的友好关系。最后他同全体代表团团员一一握手，在代表团团员们的热烈鼓掌声中离去。
