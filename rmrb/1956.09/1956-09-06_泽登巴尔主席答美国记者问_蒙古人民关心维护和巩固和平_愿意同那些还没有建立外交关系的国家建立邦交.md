Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, September 5th: The Mongolian newspaper "Unen" published on September 4th the answers of Tsedenbal, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Mongolian People's Republic, to questions raised by Larsen, a reporter from the American "Life" magazine, and Raymond, a reporter from the "New York Times," who are currently in Mongolia.

When answering questions about the major issues facing the Mongolian People's Republic in the current international situation, Tsedenbal emphasized that the Mongolian People's Republic has been pursuing a policy of peace since its very first day. He said that today, the Mongolian People's Republic maintains diplomatic relations with world powers such as the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and India, as well as several other countries. The populations of these countries account for half of humanity. Mongolia strives to expand its diplomatic relations. The Mongolian people are engaged in peaceful construction. Their primary concern is maintaining and consolidating peace.

Speaking about the Mongolian People's Republic's attitude towards the United Nations, Tsedenbal recounted that the Mongolian People's Republic was one of the first countries to endorse the lofty ideals of this international organization, applying to join the United Nations as early as 1946. He pointed out that, due to obstacles created by some groups violating the UN Charter under all sorts of completely absurd pretexts, the Mongolian People's Republic has not yet been admitted to the United Nations.

Tsedenbal recalled that at the Tenth UN General Assembly, an overwhelming majority of representatives voted in favor of admitting the Mongolian People's Republic to the United Nations. He expressed his belief that the Mongolian People's Republic, which follows a policy of peace and helped the Allied peoples in their struggle during World War II, will become a member of the United Nations.

American journalists asked about the attitude of the Mongolian People's Republic towards maintaining cultural and political relations with the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the United States. Tsedenbal replied that the Mongolian People's Republic has long maintained the closest and most friendly relations with its two great neighbors, the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China.

Tsedenbal said that as for those countries that have not yet established diplomatic or other relations with the Mongolian People's Republic, especially the United States, our country is willing to establish and develop such relations on the basis of equality, mutual respect for independence and sovereignty, and non-interference in internal affairs.

    泽登巴尔主席答美国记者问
    蒙古人民关心维护和巩固和平
    愿意同那些还没有建立外交关系的国家建立邦交
    新华社5日讯　塔斯社乌兰巴托讯：蒙古“真理报”在9月4日刊载了蒙古人民共和国部长会议主席泽登巴尔对现在在蒙古的美国“生活”杂志记者拉森和“纽约时报”记者雷蒙德所提出的问题的答复。
    泽登巴尔在答复关于蒙古人民共和国在目前国际局势中面临的重大问题的询问的时候着重指出，蒙古人民共和国自从成立第一天以来一直在推行一种和平的政策。他说，今天，蒙古人民共和国同苏联、中华人民共和国和印度这样的世界大国以及若干其他国家保持着外交关系。而这些国家的人口占人类的半数。蒙古力求扩大外交关系。蒙古人民正在从事和平的建设劳动。他们所主要关心的是维护和巩固和平。
    在讲到蒙古人民共和国对联合国的态度的时候，泽登巴尔追述说，蒙古人民共和国是第一批赞同这个国际组织的崇高理想的国家之一，远在1946年它就提出了加入联合国的申请。他指出，但是，由于一些正在各种完全无稽的借口下违反联合国宪章的集团所制造的障碍，蒙古人民共和国还没有被接纳加入联合国。
    泽登巴尔追述说，在第十届联合国大会上，占压倒多数的代表投票赞成接纳蒙古人民共和国加入联合国。他表示相信遵循和平政策并且在第二次世界大战中帮助了盟国人民的斗争的蒙古人民共和国将成为联合国会员国。
    美国记者问到蒙古人民共和国对于同苏联，中华人民共和国及美国保持文化、政治关系的态度，泽登巴尔回答说，蒙古人民共和国长久以来一直和它的两大邻邦苏联和中华人民共和国保持着最亲密最友好的关系。
    泽登巴尔说，至于那些还没有同蒙古人民共和国建立外交或其他关系的国家，尤其是美国，我们的国家很愿意在平等、互相尊重独立和主权和互不干涉内政的基础上建立和发展这样的关系。
