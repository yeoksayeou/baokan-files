Division of Labor and Specialization Takes Care of Strengths
Luzhai County's Hongqi Cooperative Rationally Utilizes Female Labor
(Reported by this newspaper) The Hongqi Agricultural Production Cooperative in Luzhai County, Guangxi Province, assigns farm work to its female members according to their strengths and physical abilities, achieving appropriate division of labor between men and women and rational utilization of female labor. For example, during the spring plowing season, men are assigned to plow fields and transport fertilizer, while stronger female laborers transplant rice seedlings; weaker or semi-able-bodied laborers pull seedlings and sow seeds; and the weakest take care of babies and select seeds. For individual women who are not suitable for the above situations, other arrangements are made. For example, female member Aunt Yang is patient and good at raising pigs, so she is assigned to raise pigs; Qin Pingzhen, Zhou Xiangbi, and others who are not good at agricultural production are assigned to cut pig feed, carry water, water vegetables, and work the bellows for the blacksmith group. Because of this rational use of female labor, labor efficiency has been greatly improved, and the enthusiasm of women has been brought into play.

    分工分业照顾特长
    鹿寨县红旗社合理使用女劳力
    本报讯　广西省鹿寨县红旗农业生产合作社根据妇女社员的特长和体力强弱给她们分配农活，做到男女适当分工分业合理使用妇女劳力。比如在春耕的时候，男的安排去犁田、运肥，妇女劳力强的去插秧；弱的或半劳动力去扯秧和点种；再弱的就带娃娃和选种。对个别不适合以上情况的妇女，又作另外安排。比如女社员杨婶有耐心，是养猪的好手，就分配她养猪；不会搞农业生产的秦平珍、周相碧等，则分配她们割猪菜、挑水、浇菜，给铁工组拉风箱等工作。由于这样合理使用妇女劳动力，就大大提高了劳动效率，发挥了妇女的积极性。
