Historical lessons of the Chinese Revolution

The history of the Chinese revolution shows that without understanding Marxism-Leninism, the revolution cannot avoid failure; even with Marxism-Leninism, if it is not combined with the actual conditions of the revolution, it still cannot avoid failure. But once Marxism-Leninism is combined with the actual conditions of the revolution, it will be invincible.

Speech by Comrade Lin Boqu, Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee

I fully agree with Comrade Liu Shaoqi's political report, the new Party Constitution and Comrade Deng Xiaoping's report, the proposal for the Second Five-Year Plan and Comrade Zhou Enlai's report.

In the eleven years from the Seventh to the Eighth National Congress of our Party, our Party led the people of the whole country in two revolutions - bourgeois democratic revolution and socialist revolution. Our country has not only been liberated from the oppression of imperialism and feudalism, and gained freedom and independence, but has also entered a great era of building socialism.

This great development has greatly changed the face of our country. Although our country is still economically backward, if we compare our past with our present, then the past was hell and the present is paradise, the difference is incalculable.

After the Opium War, there was a long period when foreign colonialists despised the Chinese people and regarded them as an inferior race who could be arbitrarily invaded and insulted. People like me grew up in a period when China was subjected to foreign aggression. What I saw, heard and felt since I was a child was nothing but the threat of foreign aggressors. The disintegration of Chinese feudal society accelerated during this period due to the dumping of foreign manufactured goods and the import of capital. A large number of peasants and small handicraftsmen lost their livelihoods. The nascent national bourgeoisie, urban petty bourgeoisie, and even some of the landlord class were all involved in this unprecedented and drastic upheaval.

At that time, what was the way out for China? It was a big question. Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao, the earliest bourgeois politicians in China, and others, demanded that the emperor of China at that time be determined to learn from Peter the Great of Russia and the Meiji Emperor of Japan and implement comprehensive reforms. They advocated reform and launched a political movement, directly fighting against the conservatives in the Qing government. Although the outcome of the struggle was the failure of the reformists, they left a great influence among intellectuals. Since then, more and more people have been concerned about the fate of the nation. The bourgeois revolutionary movement led by Sun Yat-sen developed on this basis. Sun Yat-sen did not advocate learning from Peter the Great of Russia and the Meiji Restoration of Japan, but advocated learning from the revolutions in the United States and France. He put forward the program of overthrowing the Qing government and establishing a bourgeois republic. This program was supported by the people. The Qing Dynasty rule was regarded as a thorn in the flesh, and the parliamentary system was regarded as a good medicine for saving the times, so the Revolution of 1911 broke out.

The Revolution of 1911 was a historically significant democratic revolution led by the bourgeoisie. This revolution overthrew the Qing government, ended the autocratic monarchy, and eliminated a major obstacle to progress. At that time, people were so excited that they thought that the establishment of a parliamentary government would improve China's status. But the fact was not so. The revolution did not solve China's tasks of anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism, and the parliament did not show any strength. Although the parliamentary system was better than the autocratic monarchy under certain historical conditions, it completely went bankrupt in China. The warlords at that time did not allow the parliamentary system to exist. At first, Yuan Shikai abolished it, restored the autocratic monarchy, and made himself emperor. After Yuan Shikai's death, the Northern Warlords abolished it repeatedly. The anti-Yuan and the constitutional protection movements after the Revolution of 1911 were movements to try to save the parliamentary system. Many comrades and I participated in this effort. Obviously, the facts at that time had proved that the bourgeois parliamentary system was not suitable for China's national conditions, but there was no other way, because we did not yet understand Marxism and did not understand that it could show us the best way to save China. The October Revolution in Russia solved this problem with a bang. I think that those who have experienced it personally will be able to appreciate that the October Revolution not only influenced the Chinese working class and new intellectuals, but also influenced many others who originally yearned for the bourgeois national system but later felt disappointed in it. They held sincere wishes to completely transform China. Some of them joined the Chinese Communist Party without hesitation, and some became friends of the Communist Party. Because China's way out at that time was so vague, Sun Yat-sen, who worked hard to find a way out for China, cheered "Because of the Russian Revolution, a great hope was born for the human race in the world," and became the person who advocated cooperation with the Communist Party within the Kuomintang.

It is ridiculous that in recent years there have been many foreign bourgeois critics who have tried to convince the Chinese people that the bourgeois system is better than the socialist system. We cannot but think that their attempt is stupid. Because it was precisely after recognizing that the bourgeois system would not work in China that the Chinese people chose socialism. Now that socialism has proven itself to be a superior social system that is truly suitable for China's national conditions, how can it be possible to believe that the bourgeois system is better than the socialist system? Of course not possible.

But when the Chinese people accepted Marxism-Leninism and established the Communist Party of China, there were no rules to follow on how to use Marxism-Leninism to solve China's problems and find a path to realize socialism under Chinese conditions. The principle that backward countries cannot copy the methods of capitalist countries, implement socialist revolution at the beginning, but must go through bourgeois democratic revolution before they can be transformed into socialist revolution, has already been solved in the works of the great Lenin. However, how to lead China's bourgeois democratic revolution and transform it into a socialist revolution must be solved by the Chinese Communists themselves. Did our party solve this problem well from the beginning? No. The establishment of cooperation with Sun Yat-sen from 1922 to 1925, the reorganization of the Kuomintang into an alliance of various revolutionary classes, the extensive mobilization of the masses, the assistance to Sun Yat-sen in establishing revolutionary armed forces, and the Northern Expedition in 1926 were all good and correct, so the revolution achieved unprecedented development. But there was one thing that was not good, and that was Chen Duxiu's leadership. Originally, our party was still in its infancy at that time, most people's Marxist level was still very low, and they lacked serious research on China's history and social conditions, so even if Chen Duxiu's leadership was not good, it was not corrected early. Chen Duxiu's view of the Chinese revolution was right-leaning opportunism. He believed that since the Chinese revolution was a bourgeois democratic revolution, it was the same as the French Revolution of 1789 and the Revolution of 1911, and it was the business of the bourgeoisie. The proletariat should be particularly polite to the bourgeoisie in its alliance with the bourgeoisie, and should not strive for leadership, should not control the army, should not let go of mobilizing the revolutionary people, and should not support the peasants in carrying out land revolution. As a result, under Chiang Kai-shek's counter-revolutionary attack in 1927, our party was unable to carry out an effective counterattack, and the failure of the revolution became inevitable.

This lesson was extremely profound. After 1927, the party accepted this lesson and resolutely carried out armed struggle against Chiang Kai-shek's reactionaries. However, in the first seven years of this period, the party was still unable to avoid the mistakes of the three "left" leaning lines. Although the content of the three "left" leaning lines was different, they had a common feature, that is, subjectivism, disrespect for facts, and determining the revolutionary line from dogmatism and doctrines instead of starting from China's specific historical conditions. The opportunists thought they were Marxists-Leninists, but in fact they were violating Marxism-Leninism. Marxism-Leninism itself is a science. When we specifically use it to determine the revolutionary line, we should also base it on scientific arguments, that is, specific objective facts. Without this foundation, if this foundation is not reliable, then the determined line can only lead the revolution to failure, and cannot lead the revolution to victory.

After the Zunyi Conference corrected the errors of the "left" leaning line represented by Wang Ming and Bo Gu, the party, under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, implemented the Marxist-Leninist line based on China's specific historical conditions, and we saw the vigorous development of the revolution. We not only successfully completed the Long March, but also established the anti-Japanese national united front and launched the anti-Japanese war. When the Seventh National Congress was held in 1945, our party had already achieved extensive development on all fronts of the revolution and formed an invincible and powerful force. And from the Seventh National Congress to the Eighth National Congress, the Party has led the people of the whole country to achieve a complete victory in the democratic revolution, and is achieving a victory in the socialist revolution. Our country is developing by leaps and bounds. Looking at the past from the present, the changes are so great that people can hardly believe that it used to be such a backward country that was bullied by others.

Comrades, from what has been said above, we can see that without understanding Marxism-Leninism, the Chinese revolution cannot avoid failure; even with Marxism-Leninism, if it is not combined with the actual conditions of the Chinese revolution, it still cannot avoid failure. But once Marxism-Leninism is combined with the actual conditions of the Chinese revolution, it will be invincible. Isn't this enough to show the harm of subjectivism and the extreme importance of creatively applying Marxism-Leninism? To continue to achieve victory in the socialist revolution, we should remember the lessons we have learned at the cost of countless sacrifices. Because the combination of Marxism-Leninism and the actual conditions of the Chinese revolution is not only important in the past, in the bourgeois democratic revolution, but also important in the present, in the socialist revolution. And subjectivism, which once caused us to fail in the democratic revolution in the past, can also cause us to suffer serious setbacks in the socialist revolution now.

We should strive to study Marxism-Leninism. Comrade Liu Shaoqi particularly pointed out in the political report of the Party Central Committee that senior cadres should systematically study the theory of Marxism-Leninism. I think this suggestion is very important. Only when we have more and more people who truly understand Marxism-Leninism and can use it maturely can the victory of socialist construction in our country be reliably guaranteed.

    中国革命的历史教训
    中国革命的历史说明：在没有认识马克思列宁主义以前，革命不能免于失败；在有了马克思列宁主义以后，如果不与革命实际相结合，也还是不能免于失败。而一经把马克思列宁主义与革命实际相结合，则无往而不胜。
    中共中央政治局委员　林伯渠同志的发言
    我完全同意刘少奇同志的政治报告，新的党章和邓小平同志的报告，关于第二个五年计划的建议和周恩来同志的报告。
    我们的党在第七次大会到第八次大会的十一年间，领导全国人民进行了两次革命——资产阶级民主革命和社会主义革命。我国不但已经从帝国主义和封建主义压迫下解放出来，获得了自由和独立，而且进入了建设社会主义的大时代。
    这个伟大的发展已经使得我们国家的面貌大为改观。尽管我国在经济方面还是落后的，但是如果拿我们的过去同我们的现在比较，那么，过去是地狱，现在是天堂，相距不可以道里计。
    鸦片战争以后曾经有一个很长的时期，外国殖民主义者鄙视中国人，把中国人看做劣等民族，可以任意加以侵凌和侮辱。像我这样一辈的人，就是在中国备受外国侵凌的时期中生长起来的。从小所见所闻所感受的，无一而非外国侵略者的威胁。中国封建社会的解体过程，在这个时期中，因为外国机器制造品的倾销和资本的输入而加速发展。大量的农民和小手工业者失去了生路。正在困苦地生长着的民族资产阶级，城市小资产阶级，甚至地主阶级的一部分都卷入了这个空前未有的、急剧的大动荡中。
    当时中国的出路在那里，真是一个大问题。中国的最早的资产阶级政治家康有为和梁启超等一班人，要求当时中国的皇帝下决心学俄国的彼得大帝和日本的明治天皇，实行全面的改革。他们以维新为号召，发起一个政治运动。直接同清朝政府中的守旧派进行斗争。斗争的结局，虽然是维新派的失败，但是他们在知识分子中留下了很大的影响。从此，关心民族命运的人越来越多了。孙中山领导的资产阶级革命运动，就是在这个基础上发展起来的。孙中山不主张学俄国彼得大帝和日本的维新，而主张学美国和法国的革命。他提出了推翻清朝政府和建立资产阶级共和国的纲领。这个纲领获得了人们的拥护，清朝统治被看作眼中之钉，议会制度被看作救时的良药，于是爆发了辛亥革命。
    辛亥革命是资产阶级领导的一次有历史意义的民主革命。这次革命推翻了清朝政府，把君主专制制度结束了，消除了一个进步的大障碍。当时人们真是兴奋的了不得，以为建立了议会政府，中国的地位就提高了。谁知事实并不如此。革命没有解决中国反帝国主义和反封建主义的任务，议会也显不出自己有什么力量。虽然在一定历史条件下，议会制度比君主专制好，但在中国却彻底地破产了。当时的军阀也不容许议会制度存在下去。最初袁世凯把它取消，仍旧恢复君主专制，自己做皇帝。袁世凯死后，北洋军阀又累次把它取消。辛亥革命以后的反袁和护法运动，就是努力去挽救议会制度的运动。我和许多同志都曾经参加过这种努力。很明显，当时事实已经证明资产阶级的议会制度，是不适合中国国情的了，可是除此以外，也还没有别的办法，因为我们还不认识马克思主义，还不懂得它可以指示我们救中国的最好的办法。俄国十月革命一声炮响，才解决了这个问题。我想，有亲身经历的人就会能够体会到，十月革命不仅影响了中国的工人阶级和新的知识分子，而且影响了其他许多本来向往资产阶级国家制度而后来又对它感觉失望的人，他们抱着彻底改造中国的恳切的愿望，有的毫不犹疑地参加了中国共产党，有的变成了共产党的朋友。由于当时中国的出路是如此渺茫，所以努力为中国找出路的孙中山，欢呼“因为有了俄国革命，世界人类便生出了一个大希望”，并且成为国民党内部倡导与共产党合作的人。
    可笑最近几年来还有许多外国资产阶级的论客，企图使中国人相信资产阶级制度比社会主义制度好些。我们不能不认为他们的这种企图是愚蠢的。因为，中国人正是在认识了资产阶级制度在中国行不通以后，才选择社会主义的。现在，在社会主义已经证明了它是真正适合中国国情的优越的社会制度以后，怎么可能反而相信资产阶级制度比社会主义制度更好一些呢？当然不可能。
    可是当初中国人接受马克思列宁主义，建立中国共产党的时候，关于怎样用马克思列宁主义来解决中国问题，在中国条件下找出实现社会主义的道路，是并没有什么章程可查的。落后国家不能照抄资本主义国家的办法，一开头就实行社会主义革命，而必须经过资产阶级民主革命，才能转变为社会主义革命，这个原则，在伟大的列宁的著作中早已经解决了的。然而怎样领导中国的资产阶级民主革命，并使之转变为社会主义革命，就必须靠中国的共产党人自己来解决。我们党是不是一开始就把这个问题解决得很好呢？不是的。一九二二至二五年建立同孙中山的合作，把国民党改组为各革命阶级的联盟，广泛地发动群众，协助孙中山建立革命武装，以及一九二六年的北伐，所有这些，都是好的，正确的，所以革命获得了空前的发展。但是有一桩不好，这就是陈独秀的领导。原来我们党在当时还是在幼年时代，大多数人马克思主义水平还很低，对于中国的历史和社会状况还缺乏认真的研究，因此陈独秀的领导那怕不好，也没有能够及早把它纠正过来。陈独秀对于中国革命的看法，是右倾机会主义的。他以为中国革命既然是资产阶级民主革命，那么，它就同一七八九年的法国革命和一九一一年的辛亥革命一样，是资产阶级的事情。无产阶级在与资产阶级的联盟中应当对资产阶级特别客气，不要去争取领导权，不要去掌握军队，不要去放手发动革命的人民，不要去支持农民进行土地革命。结果在一九二七年蒋介石反革命袭击之下，我们党便无法进行有效的反击，革命的失败竟成为不可避免的。
    这个教训真是深刻极了。在一九二七年以后，党接受这个教训，坚决地进行了反对蒋介石反动派的武装斗争。但是在这个时期的前七年中，党内还是不能免于三次“左”倾路线的错误。三次“左”倾路线的内容尽管各有不同，然而有一个共同的特征，这就是主观主义，不尊重事实，不从中国的具体历史条件出发而从武断和教条出发来确定革命的路线。机会主义者他们自以为是马克思列宁主义，而实际上是违反马克思列宁主义的。马克思列宁主义本身是科学，当我们具体运用它来确定革命路线的时候，同样应当以科学的论据，即具体的客观的事实为基础。如果没有这个基础，如果这个基础不是可靠的，那么，所确定的路线当然只能引导革命走到失败，而不能引导革命取得胜利。
    在遵义会议纠正了以王明、博古为代表的“左”倾路线的错误以后，党在毛泽东同志领导下，执行了以中国具体历史条件为根据的马克思列宁主义路线，我们便看到了革命的蓬勃发展。我们不仅胜利地完成了长征，而且建立了抗日民族统一战线，发动了抗日战争。当一九四五年举行第七次代表大会的时候，我们党已经在革命的各个战线上获得了广泛的发展，形成了不可战胜的强大的力量。而从第七次大会到第八次大会，党已经领导全国人民取得了民主革命的彻底胜利，并且正在取得社会主义革命的胜利。我们的国家飞跃地发展着，以今视昔，变化是如此之大，人们几乎不能相信它过去竟是那样一个受人欺侮的落后的国家了。
    同志们，由上面所说，我们可以看到，在没有认识马克思列宁主义以前，中国革命不能免于失败；在有了马克思列宁主义以后，如果不与中国革命实际相结合，也还是不能免于失败。而一经把马克思列宁主义与中国革命实际相结合，则无往而不胜。这难道不足以说明主观主义的危害性，和创造性地运用马克思列宁主义的极端重要吗？我们要继续在社会主义革命中取得胜利，就应当记得我们付出了无数代价得来的教训。因为马克思列宁主义与中国革命实际的结合，不仅在过去，在资产阶级民主革命中，是重要的；在现在，在社会主义革命中，同样是重要的。而主观主义，在过去曾经使得我们在民主革命中遭到失败，在现在也同样可以使得我们在社会主义革命中遭到严重的挫折。
    我们应当努力学习马克思列宁主义。刘少奇同志在党中央委员会的政治报告中特别指出高级干部应当系统地学习马克思列宁主义的理论，我以为这个建议是非常重要的。只有在我们有了越来越多的人真正懂得马克思列宁主义，并且能够成熟地运用它的时候，我国社会主义建设的胜利，才算有了可靠的保证。
