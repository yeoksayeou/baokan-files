    The Rights and Wrongs of "Opinion Letters"
    Jiang Ming
    There have already been cases of people speaking out for shop assistants, train attendants, and other service personnel who have been bullied. While public opinion should condemn those who make things difficult, the leaders of these units should also engage in self-reflection.
    Lazy leaders always want to find convenient ways to replace complex and detailed work, and this is no exception when assessing cadres. They are never willing to go deep into the masses to investigate and research, but are merely content to flip through suggestion books or opinion letters, using these to judge a person's performance. This turns something that should only be one of the bases for evaluation into the sole magic weapon. Thus, the railways saw things like requiring train attendants to receive a certain number of letters of commendation each month, and they even called it a "commendation quota!" (See People's Daily, August 19)
    Of course, deviations followed.
    First, good service personnel are forced to act cautiously and timidly in their work. Sometimes, when a dispute arises with a customer, even if they are right, they dare not say a word; otherwise, if the other party writes an opinion letter, the leadership will use it to condemn them, not only putting a black mark against their name but also forgetting about any bonuses. If they want to defend themselves, the leadership always has a reason, such as "there's no smoke without fire," and so on.
    For the vast majority of service personnel, this seems to have become an overwhelming pressure! This pressure makes service personnel suffer countless grievances in the face of difficult people; this pressure makes our female shop assistants swallow their tears after being insulted by individual bad elements; perhaps it is this pressure that has caused shop assistants who originally loved their jobs to waver, even losing the courage to continue working! The difficult people and individual bad elements must bear this responsibility; but the simplistic style of those leaders who set "commendation quotas" has also fueled the arrogance of the difficult people.
    Secondly, for those who are already doing a poor job, it provides them with great convenience to exploit loopholes. They try every means to solicit "praise." Thus, train attendants ignore women and children who need care, and instead only cater to people with pens in their pockets, so that they can hand them an opinion book at the opportunity and ask them to write a few complimentary comments. Of course, they may verbally ask you to make criticisms in order to improve their work, but in reality, they are truly "thinking of something else" and have no intention of improving their work at all.
    There is another example, as seen in the Beijing Daily on June 26. Hou Yuzhong, a salesperson in the leather goods department of the Beijing Department Store, precisely grasped the leadership's mentality, so every night, he secretly put the opinion letters he had already written praising himself into the suggestion box. He even used this method to steal honors. In addition to serving as the secretary of the Youth League branch, even more interesting is that he became a service attitude inspector. Are the eyes of the pitiable leaders not a huge irony!

    “意见书”的是非
    江名
    已经有为售货员、列车员等服务人员受欺侮而喊冤的了。我想在社会舆论给那些刁难者以谴责之余，这些单位的领导者也应有以自省了。
    懒惰的领导者，总想找些省事的办法来代替复杂细致的工作，在考核干部时，也不例外。他们从不愿深入群众去调查研究，却仅仅满足于翻看意见薄或意见书，并以此来判断一个人的工作好坏。这就把本来只能作为评断的依据之一的东西，当成唯一的法宝了。于是铁路上就出现了给列车员规定每月应收到多少表扬信之类的事，而且他们还美其名曰：“表扬指标”！（见8月19日人民日报）
    当然，偏差也就接踵而至了。
    首先是使好的服务人员在工作中不得不束手束脚、谨小慎微，有时与顾客发生争执，本来自己有理，却也不敢多说一句；否则只要对方写上一个意见书，领导上就会据以定罪，除了在自己名下插上黑旗外，奖金等等也就甭想再领了。要想申辩，领导上却总是有理，如“无风不起浪”等云云。
    对于广大的服务人员来说，这似乎已经成为一股难已抗驭的压力了！这压力，使得服务人员在刁难者的面前不知受了多少委屈；这压力，使得我们的女售货员，在受了个别坏分子的侮辱之后只能把眼泪往自己肚子里流；也许正是这种压力吧，使得原是热爱自己职业的售货员也发生了动摇，甚至失去了工作下去的勇气！这责任，刁难者和个别坏分子必须承当；但那些制定“表扬指标”的领导者的简单化作风，也助长了刁难者的淫威。
    其次，对于那些本来工作就不好的人来说，倒是给他们钻空子以莫大的便利，他们就想尽办法来招徕“表扬”，于是列车员眼望着应该照顾的妇孺不管，却一味应承口袋插有钢笔的人，以便遇机递上意见簿，请他们写下几条表扬自己的意见，当然，他口头上也许让你提出批评，以改进工作等等，其实真是“醉翁之意”，未必有半点想改进工作的意思。
    例子还有一个，事见6月26日北京日报。北京百货大楼皮货部的售货员侯毓中，正是摸准了领导者的这种脾气，于是每当深夜，他就偷偷地把自己早已写好了的表扬自己的意见书投往意见箱，甚至他真的用此方法盗取了荣誉，除了担任了青年团的支部书记外，更有意思的是当了服务态度检查员。可悲的领导者的眼睛，难道这不是一个天大的讽刺吗！
