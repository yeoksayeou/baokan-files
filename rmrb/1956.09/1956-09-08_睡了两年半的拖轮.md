    Tugboat Asleep for Two and a Half Years
    On the river surface to the right of the Nanjing Shipbuilding and Repair Plant in Sanpailou, Nanjing, sits a Huainan-branded tugboat that has been sleeping for two and a half years. This tugboat is eighty-two feet long and equipped with a 140-horsepower steam engine, capable of towing 500 tons of cargo upstream and nearly 2,000 tons downstream. Surprisingly, since it was taken over by the Nanjing Port Authority in February 1954, this tugboat has been sleeping soundly in the Sanpailou River, guarded day and night by two veteran workers. Is it not the case that the country's shipping vessels are too few, rather than too many? If this tugboat could participate in inland river transport for two and a half years, how much wealth would it create for the country? And how great a role would it play in the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas?
    The outer iron shell of this tugboat is still in good condition; only the boiler is old. If it could be overhauled, it could still operate on short-distance routes. Currently, the paint on the hull has peeled off due to sun and rain, and the white canvas covering the chimney has rotted. We hope that relevant departments will take measures quickly and not let this tugboat continue to sleep.　Qu Chaohong

    睡了两年半的拖轮
    在南京市三?河南京船舶修造厂前右方的河面上，停着一艘已经睡了两年半觉的淮南号拖轮。这艘拖轮有八丈二尺长，装有一百四十匹马力的蒸汽机，逆水能拖五百吨货物，顺水能拖近二千吨的货物。奇怪的是这艘拖轮自1954年2月由南京港务局接管后，一直停在三?河里睡大觉，而且还有两位老工人日夜看守着它。现在国家的航运船只不是太多，而是太少，如果这艘拖轮两年半内都能参加内河运输，会给国家创造多少财富？对城乡物资交流又将起多么大的作用？
    这艘拖轮外铁壳还很好，只是锅炉老了，如能大修一下，还是能开短程航运的。目前，船壳油漆在日晒雨淋下已经脱落，覆盖在烟囱上的白帆布已经霉烂了。希望有关部门赶快采取措施，不要让这艘拖轮再睡下去了。　曲超宏
