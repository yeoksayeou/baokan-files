Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, August 31st. Warsaw newspapers reported that Professor Horobuski, director of the Neurosurgery Department of the Warsaw Medical Academy, successfully performed a surgery to remove the left cerebral hemisphere of a child three months ago.

The patient who underwent the surgery was eight-year-old Stanislav. Six months prior, he developed a malignant tumor in his left cerebral hemisphere, which prevented him from speaking normally, and his hand and foot movements were also uncoordinated. He had undergone three surgeries in the hospital. However, due to the limitations of medical equipment, the small roots of the tumor could not be removed, and the tumor later grew back. As a result, Stanislav fell into a state of hemiplegia and neurological disorders. At that time, the only way to save him was to completely remove the left cerebral hemisphere.

Professor Horobuski successfully performed the surgery. Although after the surgery, the patient experienced involuntary movements of the right side of his body and his right hand and foot, these symptoms quickly disappeared under the care of doctors. The patient's right cerebral hemisphere effectively took over the functions of the left cerebral hemisphere. Now, the patient has finally recovered completely and is completely normal.

It is said that this type of surgery can only be performed on young children whose brains have not yet fully matured.

    波兰医生割除一小孩左大脑半球成功
    病人现在已最后痊愈，一切正常
    新华社华沙31日电　华沙报纸报道，华沙医学院神经系外科主任霍罗布斯基教授在三个月前曾经成功地作了一次切去一小孩左大脑半球的手术。
    动手术的病人是八岁小孩斯塔尼斯拉夫。他在半年前由于左大脑半球内生了恶性肿瘤而不能正常说话，手足动作也失调了。他曾经在医院中动过三次手术。但是都由于受到医疗器械的限制，未能将肿瘤的细小根部割除，后来肿瘤又生长了起来。于是，斯塔尼斯拉夫又陷入半身不遂和神经失常状态。当时唯一解救的办法就是完全割去左大脑半球。
    霍罗布斯基教授成功地施行了这次手术。虽然在手术过后，病者曾经发生过右半身和右手足不能如意动作的现象。但是在医生调护下这种现象很快就消除了。病人的右大脑半球很好地接替了左大脑半球的机能。现在，病人已经最后痊愈，一切正常。
    据说，只有对大脑发育尚未完全成熟的幼孩，才能够作这种手术。
