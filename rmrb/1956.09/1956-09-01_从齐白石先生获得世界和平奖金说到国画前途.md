The World Peace Council's recent award of the International Peace Prize to Chinese painter Mr. Qi Baishi has been met with congratulations from the art community both at home and abroad. This is not only a joyous occasion for Mr. Baishi personally, but also a joyful event for the Chinese people and peace-loving people worldwide. It is an even more significant event for the Chinese painting community! As a member of the art world and one of Mr. Baishi's old friends, I feel even more touched and have more thoughts to share as I participate in this celebration. Therefore, I am writing them down as a congratulation to Mr. Baishi and with some personal opinions, hoping to stimulate discussion among art-loving friends.

Humanity's various virtues – love of peace, love of nation and country, love of labor and life, praising beautiful things, combating evil deeds… etc. – are often expressed by artists through their works. The reason why Mr. Qi Baishi's paintings are welcomed by art lovers around the world and his artistic achievements are affirmed is that his works can express these common feelings of the people in a superb artistic form.

As a painter, of course, good technique is required, but for thousands of years, the Chinese art world has also held a traditional belief that painting "well" is not enough; the painter must also have "character." Yang Tieyai said, "The quality of painting is related to the height of human character" (Yang Weizhen's painting theory of the Yuan Dynasty), which is reasonable. The so-called painting character and human character are both measured according to the standards of the people. Qin Hui, who killed Yue Fei for betraying the country, had excellent calligraphy. Ruan Dacheng, who harmed the Donglin Party and eventually surrendered to the Qing Dynasty, was also excellent in writing lyrics and songs. However, for many years, no one has praised their calligraphy or writings. Naturally, Wang Jingwei's collection of poems will certainly not be passed down to future generations, because their human character cannot withstand the measurement of the people's standards. In the dark periods of Chinese history, artists often expressed their resistance and non-cooperation with the rulers through their actions. The famous Four Great Masters of the Yuan Dynasty (Huang Gongwang, Wang Meng, Ni Zan, and Wu Zhen) did not paint Yuan Dynasty clothing when painting figures. They used this attitude to express their passive resistance to the rulers at the time. Zheng Suonan never painted land when painting orchids, saying that the land had long been taken away by foreign races. In the early Qing Dynasty, painters Shi Tao, Shi Xi, Bada Shanren, and Qichu, etc., all became monks after the fall of the Ming Dynasty in order not to cooperate with the invaders, and even pretended to be crazy and mute all day long. Many of these stories can be found in the history of Chinese painting. Similarly, when the Japanese warlords occupied Beijing, Mr. Baishi refused the invitation from the puppet Art Academy. When there was no fire in the severe winter, he would rather return the coal sent by the puppet regime and posted a "notice" on the door, not allowing those "officials" to enter his house to see him. He hated those who cooperated with the invaders, and he used harsh words to inscribe on his paintings, scolding these people as "cormorants not eating cormorant flesh." He also hated the corrupt officials who only knew how to exploit the people and did nothing good before liberation, using a tumbler with no ink in their chests to compare them. In Mr. Baishi's past painting inscriptions, there are many similar expressions. These behaviors show Mr. Baishi's psychology, which was also the common psychology of the vast majority of people at that time. Although, due to the limitations of the historical environment, Mr. Baishi's methods of expression were different, in his heart, he was consistent with the main wishes of the majority of the people at that time.

The reason why Mr. Baishi enjoys the supreme glory given to him today by the peace-loving people of the world is, of course, due to his unique achievements in art and his consistent like and dislike with the majority of the people in his past and present life. But more importantly, it is because our country has stood up in the world today, because of the prosperity of our country, our culture and art can be brilliantly expressed in the world, our artists can resonate with the vast majority of people around the world with their outstanding thoughts and feelings, and our artistic talents can be respected by people around the world. In the past history of Chinese painting, there were also many artists with artistic conscience and a sense of justice who worked faithfully for their beloved labor and the art loved by the people, engaging in creation with hard work, but what they got was not honor, but a life of being destroyed and slandered. Mr. Baishi, in the eighty-nine years before liberation, according to his own self-description and diary, also encountered the same situation. As long as we recall Mr. Baishi's speech at the signing conference of the capital's literary and art circles against the use of atomic weapons in February last year, we can see that he would agree with the above view.

Mr. Baishi's long-term continuous hard work and his artistic creation attitude of not pandering to the times have enabled the excellent tradition of Chinese painting art to be inherited and developed. Our predecessor painters passed down famous theories, requiring painters to "learn from nature externally and derive from the heart internally," requiring a good work to "combine form and spirit." Mr. Baishi digested and integrated these valuable theories and transformed them into the basis of his own creation. Therefore, in his works, even a flower, grass, or insect is full of vitality. Take the peony flower he paints, for example. He portrays the flower as having moisture, sunshine, and, more importantly, vitality. Due to the deep depiction from "form" to "spirit," it makes people think that the flower almost has color, fragrance, and taste, and is by no means a lifeless object. Such a deep level of skill cannot be achieved without careful observation (learning from nature) and painstaking conception (including the painter's own life accumulation, technical accumulation, and views on all things in the world, i.e., "deriving from the heart"). Because Mr. Baishi mastered such artistic methods, he was able to express the feelings of a kind artist excellently. His works have a profound appeal to art lovers around the world and can represent the common hobbies and aspirations of mankind in this era. Mr. Baishi said: "When I paint an insect, I want it to be full of vitality. Who can tolerate the destruction of the beautiful world!..." (Speech at the signing conference against the use of atomic weapons) That's right. It is precisely because of his unique artistic skills that he expresses "vitality" through the forms of some ordinary flowers, plants, insects, and fish, expressing the beauty of nature and the loveliness of peaceful life. He expresses the common praise of peaceful life by kind human beings. Therefore, the common spirit of hundreds of millions of peace-loving people exists in his works. The condensation of this great spirit can completely destroy the extremely despicable attempts of those brutal murderers, aggressive warmongers, and practitioners of ugly power politics.

Mr. Baishi is ninety-six years old this year. An old man's longing for and attachment to the beautiful world is very urgent. Mr. Baishi has been painting more vigorously since liberation. When the People's Republic of China was founded, he personally carved the name seal of Chairman Mao Zedong and sent it to Chairman Mao. I fully understand his feelings.

Mr. Baishi is a figure who has succeeded through hard work. He was a shepherd boy when he was a child and only studied for half a year. Later, he worked as a carpenter for fifteen years. Because he did not relax his study of painting art in the evenings after his hard work during the day, he finally honed himself into a great painter under long-term extremely difficult conditions. In the old days, Mr. Baishi could only say that he received the help of individual teachers and friends. Therefore, his success is hard-won. Today, our literary and artistic activities are supported by the Party, the government, and even the entire society. Mr. Baishi's facts should be a powerful encouragement to all young people engaged in various literary and artistic activities. From the perspective of the entire art world, today's social conditions are also very different from those of the old society in the past. Taking Mr. Baishi as an example, how should our artists actively strive to create greater achievements?

We should admit the poverty of the modern Chinese painting world. The rich artistic creations of our predecessors gradually showed signs of decline in the recent two or three hundred years. For example, the rich figure paintings before the Song Dynasty have gradually declined. By the time of Emperor Qianlong of the Qing Dynasty, the famous portrait painting techniques had become a unique skill that was on the verge of extinction. The tenuous ruled-line painting has also been lost. Especially in the recent decades, the decline and darkness of politics and economy have been reflected in art, which is even more decadent and downward. Qi Baishi was born in this era, and therefore he is even more outstanding. However, China is a country with a long cultural tradition and rich heritage. There are many schools of art. According to the policy and spirit of "letting a hundred flowers bloom," under the promotion and cultivation of the Party and the people of the whole country, there should be more than just one Qi Baishi in the future, but there should be many Qi Baishis. As long as the people in the Chinese art world today are willing to work hard seriously, five, ten, or twenty years later, there can be more and higher Qi Baishis appearing in the Chinese art world.

Today, it is well known how our country values the excellent traditions of culture and art. First of all, it is Chinese drama, which has been vigorously developed in recent years. The sorting out and research of classical music and national music has also surpassed the past era. In the field of Chinese painting, although some achievements have been shown under the efforts of Chinese painters, how to develop Chinese painting into the art of the current great era is indeed an urgent need and a problem that still needs to be solved. I have always advocated that future painters should expand the field of Chinese painting, rather than narrow it. Since ancient times, Chinese painters have been constantly striving for this. In terms of the types of painting, in addition to absorbing many inherited and foreign methods in terms of techniques, they have also created painting methods for metal, brick, stone, bamboo, wood, pottery, porcelain, etc. In terms of coloring, water use, and ink use, there are even more tricks. Although the degree and achievements vary, the accumulated richness and the breadth of application cannot be denied or should not be denied. Moreover, the content of Chinese painting has developed with the development of the times and society. The figures, flowers, trees, birds, beasts, insects, fish, and even mountains, rivers, pavilions, and all things depicted in it can be said to have started from realism. If we continue to carry forward and develop it, combine it with the current era and the current society, and apply it to all new requirements and new meanings, its development and achievements are unimaginable. At present, people all over the world are shocked by the development and achievements of our country in politics and economy, and therefore speculate on the development and achievements of our various arts. They also speculate that our various arts had excellent traditions in the past, and will show even more brilliance if they are carried forward in the future. Also, because our drama, music, etc., already have many new expressions and new achievements, they speculate that the field of painting will also be like this. But in fact, to put it bluntly, the current so-called Chinese painting is still inevitably lagging behind the previous generations (of course, not absolutely). This is naturally the inevitable result of no one properly cultivating it for decades, and it cannot be blamed on certain people. But how did Mr. Baishi's prominence come about? I would also like to talk about it here. Mr. Baishi often said that his achievements were due to the help of teachers and friends. Most of the teachers and friends he mentioned were known to me, such as Wang Xiangqi, Fan Fanshan, Xia Wuyi, Chen Shizeng, Luo Yinggong, Wang Mengbai, etc., who can be said to be people with solid foundations in old learning. Although Mr. Baishi lost his studies when he was young, he was smart and eager to learn, so he benefited a lot from the guidance of these people. Even Mr. Qi's painting style has also benefited from many teachers, starting from Shi Tao, Bada Shanren, Jin Dongxin, Zheng Banqiao, and even Zhao Huishu and Wu Changshuo of the Qing Dynasty, and then incorporating them. This school of painters was originally considered an innovation school in the Qing Dynasty. Mr. Baishi, based on his own spirit of innovation, also had these learned and cultivated people around him day and night, influencing him unconsciously. Therefore, he was able to achieve such achievements. In other words, Mr. Baishi's paintings have the advantages of traditional literati paintings, and he is good at understanding, which unconsciously conforms to realism. This is also where those new and old painters who can only touch the walls and can't even change their faces, let alone transform themselves, can't catch up. (Chinese literati painting has its own history and status, which I will explain separately.) Mr. Baishi's achievements are here, and the value of his works is also here. But if we say that China should only have one Mr. Qi, who is unprecedented and unrepeatable, then this will inevitably lead to subjective and idol worship. Not only has Mr. Qi himself never had such a view, but also in the entire history of Chinese painting, in the future of today's great Chinese art, and in the currently urgent need to improve painting, it is absolutely not appropriate to have such a view. Such a view is a conservative view, a sectarian view, and a view that does not meet the needs. What China needs today is a living art that conforms to socialist patriotism and is loved by the masses, not a stereotyped, monotonous, bureaucratic art. For example, Qi Baishi paints shrimp, and I also paint shrimp. Qi Baishi's shrimp seem to be alive, but my shrimp seem to be motionless. Then, even if he paints eight, I also paint eight. His paper is four feet, and mine is also four feet. He uses light ink, and I also use light ink, without any difference. Does that mean I am the same as Qi Baishi? Therefore, it is said that it is precious to have a Qi Baishi today, but it does not mean that China only needs one Qi Baishi to represent Chinese art. The vast art garden of China today and in the future may not be enough to satisfy the needs even if there are hundreds of Qi Baishis. But when this transition period occurs, there is no way to order many Qi Baishis to be made. Therefore, on the one hand, we must pay special attention to and cherish this one Qi Baishi. At the same time, we also hope that many different Qi Baishis will appear. This is the so-called letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend. This is the grand event of the art world and the requirements of the country and society.

From the perspective of the historical tradition and development prospects of the entire Chinese painting, it is like the ups and downs of mountains, with endless landscapes waiting for us to climb and discover. Therefore, as modern Chinese painters, the road to strive for is endless, not at the end. We need a hundred flowers to bloom, not one flower to bloom alone. We need landscape, flower, and bird paintings, as well as figure and architectural paintings. We need both historical story paintings and realistic current affairs paintings. We hope to see the excellent traditions of Chinese painting in ink, color ink, meticulous brushwork, simplified brushwork, ruled-line painting, sketching, freehand brushwork, satire, humor, as well as prints, illustrations, posters, New Year pictures, etc. We also hope that more outstanding talents will emerge in landscape, figure, story, and current affairs paintings. We must make the various paths of painting art reach the forms and contents loved by the people, and all good art from all schools can serve the people. This is the correct path that the art sector should take in the context of the upcoming cultural climax.

Today's issue is that we must "carry on the past." It is wrong to abandon the valuable cultural accumulation obtained by our ancestors' hard work for thousands of years. We must also "open up the future." If we do not absorb nutrients from all aspects to enrich Chinese painting, so that Chinese painting itself can freely develop from form to content, and freely describe the joys, anger, sorrows, and joys in the hearts of the people of the era, it will be impossible to produce more and greater art of the era. Then how can we be worthy of this era and be considered descendants of this era? Mr. Baishi may live to be one hundred and twenty years old, but today we also need people to inherit and develop his art. Moreover, the times are constantly progressing, and we need excellent works that express today and tomorrow to be produced. Of course, what is important today is to preserve and develop the excellent tradition. Without this, our art will lose an important source. But only sticking to the past rules or failing to understand its spirit, only sticking to the withered bones, and those at a higher level are only satisfied with the achievements of ancestors and predecessors, without seeking better changes and development, then this tradition will lag behind the times, and the excellent tradition may not be able to be maintained. This is what we must be vigilant about.

The fact that the World Peace Council has awarded the International Peace Prize to Mr. Qi this time at least shows that the peace-loving countries and nations in the world also love our Chinese painting. We should have more and better Chinese paintings besides Mr. Qi's works to reach out to peace-loving countries and nations to meet their expectations and to prepare to welcome our upcoming cultural climax. This is the responsibility of all painters, whether they are old, middle-aged, or young, and they should all work hard.

Finally, I would also like to say that recently, people who discuss Chinese painting have been quite opposed to literati painting, almost considering it a poison. I don't think it is necessary to look at it this way. The so-called literati painting in the past refers to professional painters, that is, a sign that people who do not take painting as a profession engage in painting in their spare time. Among them, there are different levels of quality, but because their learning and careers have other expressions, and they are often talented, they are always given this title. Among them, there are also those who engage in ruled-line painting, meticulous brushwork, or are good at realism. It is not all about casually scribbling without content. Moreover, people who are good at calligraphy often integrate calligraphy into painting, with a unique flavor. This can at least be said to be one of the artistic traditions or one of the excellent traditions. Because Westerners do not talk about calligraphy, there is no saying of integrating calligraphy into painting in Western painting, and they cannot even understand it. But it seems that we cannot say that because Western painting does not communicate with calligraphy, our art cannot contain this bloodline, and directly say that literati painting is a bad thing and hang it as a major taboo, prohibiting learning. This is equivalent to orchids and chrysanthemums in flowers, and qin and xiao in musical instruments. Because their fragrance and charm are clear and easy for literati and scholars to appreciate, they banish orchids, chrysanthemums, qin, and xiao from the list of flowers and musical instruments and do not allow them to be used. This is not only not the principle of absorbing the essence, but also narrowing the gate. For example, Mr. Baishi's achievements are obviously deeply influenced by literati painting, and it has not hindered the development of Mr. Qi's art. On the contrary, it has helped Mr. Qi's unique style. This shows that accepting the legacy requires selection and refinement, and that "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" is only good for the development of art, and there is no harm. I believe that Mr. Qi's achievements are only the beginning of the brilliant development of Chinese painting. While congratulating Mr. Qi, I am confident in giving unlimited optimistic prospects and expectations to the future of Chinese painting.

    从齐白石先生获得世界和平奖金说到国画前途
    叶恭绰
    世界和平理事会这一次把国际和平奖金颁给我国国画家齐白石先生，国内外的文艺界同声称贺，这不仅是白石先生个人的喜事，也是中国人民和全世界和平人民的喜事，更是中国国画界的一桩大事！我作为艺术界的一员，并且忝为白石先生的老朋友之一，在分享这一份喜庆的当儿，感觉更亲切些，感想也更多一些，因此我把他写下来，作为对白石先生的祝贺，并且附带些个人意见，希望引起爱好艺术的朋友们的讨论。
    人类的各种美德：爱和平，爱民族和祖国，爱劳动生活，歌颂美好事物，打击邪恶行为……等等，往往由艺术家通过作品表现出来，齐白石先生的绘画之所以受到世界爱好艺术人士的欢迎，他在艺术上的成就被肯定下来，就是由于他的作品，能以高超的艺术形式，表现出人民的这些共同的感情。
    作为一个画家，当然要求他的技术好，但几千年来，中国艺术界还有一条传统的信条，就是画画得“好”还不算数，还要画家有“品格”。杨铁崖说“画品优劣，关于人品之高下”（元杨维桢画论），这是合理的。所谓画品人品，都是根据人民的尺度来衡量的，因卖国而杀了岳飞的秦桧，书法是很好的，残害东林最后投降清朝的阮大铖，文字词曲，也都很好，但是多少年来，谁也没有表扬过他们的书法文词，自然汪精卫的诗词集，也肯定地不会传之后世的，原因是他们的人品经不起人民尺度的衡量。在中国历史上的黑暗时期，艺术家们往往在行动上表示对统治者的反抗和不合作，著名的元代四大画家（黄公望、王蒙、倪瓒、吴镇）画人物都不画元朝衣冠，他们用这种态度，来表示对当时统治者的消极反抗。郑所南画兰花，从不画土地，说土地早给外族抢去。清初的画家石涛、石溪、八大、七处等，为了不跟侵略者合作，明亡后便都出了家，甚至整天装疯作哑。这些故事，在中国画史中，可以找到很多。同样的，日本军阀占领北京的时候，白石先生拒绝了伪美术学院的聘书，在严冬无火时，宁可退还了伪方所送的煤，写了“告白”贴在门口，不让当时那些“长官”进他的屋子去看他，他痛恨同侵略者合作的人，他曾经以刻毒的文字，题在画上，骂这些人“鸬鹚不食鸬鹚肉”；他也痛恨解放以前只知鱼肉人民不做好事的贪官污吏，用胸无点墨装模作样的不倒翁，来比喻他们。在白石先生过去的题画诗文中，有很多类此的表现。这些行为，表现出白石先生的心理，也就是当时广大人民共同的心理。虽然由于历史环境的限制，白石先生所表现的方法不同，但是在心情上，他和当时大多数人民的主要愿望是一致的。
    白石先生今天享受到世界爱好和平人民所给予他的无上光荣，固然由于他在艺术上有独特的成就，在过去和现在的生活中，他一贯地和大多数人民有共同的好恶。但是更重要的，是由于我们国家，今天在世界上已经站起来，由于我们国祚的兴隆，我们的文化艺术才能够光辉地表现于世界，我们的艺术家才能以他卓越的思想感情，同全世界广大人民起着共鸣，我们的艺术天才才能受到世界人士的尊重。在过去的中国画史中，也有不少具有艺术良心和正义感的艺术家，一生忠勤地为他自己心爱的劳动，为人民喜爱的艺术，辛辛苦苦地从事创作，可是他们所得到的，不是荣誉，而是被摧残与毁谤的一生。白石先生在解放以前八十九年的岁月中，根据他自己的自述和日记，也不是没有同样的遭际的。只要我们回忆一下去年2月间白石先生参加首都文艺界反对使用原子武器签名大会时的讲话，就可以看出他对于上面的看法，是会有同感的。
    白石先生长期不断的刻苦劳动和他不趋时不媚俗的艺术创作态度，使中国绘画艺术的优秀传统，得到继承和发展。我们先代画家，传下了著名的理论，要求画家作画，必须“外师造化中法心源”，要求一张好作品，必须“形神兼备”。白石先生消化融会了这些宝贵理论，变为他自己创作的根据，因此在他的作品中，即使一株花草或一只虫鸟，都充满了生命力。就以他画的牡丹花来说吧，他把花表现出有水份，有阳光，更有生机，由于从“形”到“神”的入骨描画，叫人想到那花几乎是有色香味的，而绝不是一株没有生命的东西。这样深到的功夫，不通过精细的观察（师造化），刻苦的构思（包括画家本人的生活积累、技巧积累和对世界万有的看法等即“法心源”），是办不到的。因为白石先生掌握了这样的艺术方法，才能够把一个善良艺术家的感情，卓越地表现出来，他的作品，对全世界的艺术爱好者，才具有湛深的感染力，才能代表这一时代人类共同的爱好和愿望。白石先生说：“我画一个草虫，都愿意它生机活泼，谁又能够容忍美好世界遭到破坏！……”（反对使用原子武器签名大会上的讲话）正是这样，正是由于他那独到的艺术技巧，通过一些平凡的花草虫鱼的形态，表现出“生机”，表现出自然的美及和平生活的可爱，他表达了善良人类所共同的对于和平生活的歌颂，因此作品里有亿万爱好和平人士的共同精神存在。这一伟大精神的凝结，是完全可以摧毁那些残暴杀人者、侵略黩武者、以及丑恶的实力政策的施行者的极端卑劣企图的。
    白石先生，今年九十六岁，一个老年人对于美好世界的向往和留恋之情，是非常迫切的。白石先生在解放以后画画得更起劲，在中华人民共和国成立的时候，亲自刻好毛泽东主席的名章，送给毛主席，我是完全了解他这种心情的。
    白石先生是一个苦干成功的人物，他小时候是一个牧童，只读过半年书，后来当过十五年的木匠，由于他在白天辛苦劳动之余，晚上还不放松他绘画艺术的钻研，在长期的极端困难的条件下，他终于磨练成为一个伟大的画家。白石先生在旧时代里只能说得到个别师友的帮助，因此他的成功，是难能可贵的。今天我们的文艺活动，是受到党和政府以至于整个社会的支持，白石先生的事实，应当更是所有从事诸般文艺活动的青年们一种极有力的鼓舞。又从整个艺术界来说，今天的社会条件和过去旧社会也迥然不同，以白石先生为例，我们的艺术家又应当如何积极努力，创造出更大的成绩呢？
    我们应该承认近代中国绘画界的贫乏。先代丰富的美术创作，到了近二、三百年，就渐呈衰落之象。即如宋以前丰富的人物画，日见式微，到了清乾隆以后，著名的传神画法，已成绝技，不绝如缕的界画，也已失传，特别是近数十年来政治经济的衰落黑暗，反映在艺术上，更是颓废向下。齐白石生当这个时代，因此更见杰出。但是中国是个有悠久文化传统的国家，遗产丰富，美术上的派别繁多，根据“百花齐放”的政策和精神，今后在党和全国人民的提倡培养之下，应该不止有一个齐白石，而应该有不少的齐白石。只要今天我们中国艺术界人士，肯认真努力，五年、十年、二十年之后，是全可以有更多更高的齐白石，在中国艺术界出现的。
    今天我们的国家，文化艺术的优良传统，如何的被重视，这是人所共知的。首先是中国戏剧，近几年来得到蓬勃发展。古典音乐民族音乐的整理研究，也超越了过去时代。国画方面，在国画家们的努力下，虽然表现了一些成绩，但是如何把国画发展成为现今大时代的艺术，实在是一个迫切需要而仍待解决的问题。我一向主张今后的画家应该扩大中国画的领域，而不是要缩小中国画的领域。自古以来，我国画家，对这一点都是不断努力的。就画的种类说，除技法上吸收了许多遗传的和外来的方法外，并且创造了金属、砖、石、竹、木、陶、磁等等的画法，至敷色、用水、用墨等，更有许多诀巧，虽然程度和成就各有高低，但积累的丰富，应用的广大，是不能抹煞也不应抹煞的。而且中国画的内容，是随着时代和社会的发展而发展的，其间所表现的人物、花木、鸟兽、虫鱼、乃至山川楼阁、以及一切事物，可说都是从写实出发的，如继续而发扬光大，结合现时代和现社会，应用于一切新要求新意义，其发展和成就，是不可思议的。目下全世界人，震惊于我国政治上经济上的发展和成就，因而推测到我国各种艺术上的发展和成就，又因而推测到我国各种艺术，以前早有优良传统，今后发扬光大，更将显出异彩。又因我国戏剧音乐等等，已有不少新表现、新成就，因而推测绘画一门也会这样，但事实上不客气地说，目今所谓国画，较之前代是仍不免落后的（自然不是绝对）。这自然是由于几十年来，根本没有人去好好培养的当然结果，不能责备某些人。但白石先生的突出，是怎样来的呢？我还想借这里说一说。白石先生常常说他的成就是得力于师友的，他所谓的师友，我多半相识，如王湘绮、樊樊山、夏午诒、陈师曾、罗瘿公、王梦白等等，可说都是旧学有根柢的人。白石先生少虽失学，但他却聪明好学，故此得力于这班人的启导不少，就是齐先生的画法，也转益多师，是由清代石涛、八大、金冬心、郑板桥，以至赵撝叔、吴昌硕一派入手，而加以鎔炼的。这一派画家，本来在清朝是要算革新派，白石先生本着自己的革新精神，又得这班有学问修养的人朝夕盘桓、耳濡目染，故能有这样的成就。换句话说，白石先生的画，是有传统文人画的优点，而加以自己善于体会，无形中符合写实主义的。这也正是一般只会扶墙摸壁，不要说脱胎换骨，连改头换面都不会的那些新画家旧画家所赶不上的地方。（中国文人画，自有其历史和地位，我将另有说明。）白石先生的成就在此，其作品的价值亦在此。但若说中国之大，只应有一个齐先生，是空前绝后的，这就不免流于主观和偶像的崇拜了。这不但齐先生自己向来没有这样看法，而且在我国的整个绘画史上，在今天伟大的中国的艺术前途上，在目前急待改进的绘画需要上，都绝对不应这样看法的。这样的看法，是故步自封的看法，是宗派主义的看法，是不切合需要的看法，我国今天的需要，是符合社会主义爱国主义和群众喜爱的活的艺术，而不是陈陈相因、千篇一律、八股性的艺术。譬如齐白石画虾，我也画虾，齐白石的虾，好像是活的，我的虾却像是不会动的，那末即使他画八个，我也画八个，他的纸是四尺，我也是四尺，他用淡墨，我也用淡墨，丝毫不差，难道就算和齐白石一样吗？所以说，今天有一个齐白石，固然难能可贵，但不是说中国只要一个齐白石，就够代表中国的艺术了。中国今天以后的广大艺术园地，就有百十个齐白石，也许还不够满足需要的，但当这青黄不接的时候，无法定做许多齐白石出来，所以一面格外要尊重宝爱这一个齐白石，同时更希望还有许多不同样的齐白石出现，就是所谓百花齐放，百家争鸣，这才是艺林的盛事和国家社会的要求。
    从整个中国画的历史传统和发展前途来看，等于万山起伏，峰回路转，正有无穷无尽的境界有待我们的攀登发现，因此作为现代的中国画家，要努力的道路正是无穷无尽，而不是临于止境。我们需要百花齐放，而不是一花独放，我们需要山水花鸟画，也需要人物建筑画，我们既需要描写古代的故事画，也需要表现现实的时事画，我们希望在水墨、彩墨、工笔、减笔、界画、写生、写意、讽刺、滑稽以及版画、插图、招贴、年画等等里面，都看见国画的优良传统，我们更希望在山水、人物、故事、时事画中，都出现更多的杰出人才，我们必需使绘画艺术的条条道路，达到人民所喜爱的形式和内容，各家各派的好艺术，都能够为人民服务，这就是今天面临文化高潮即将来到的情况下艺术部分应走的正确道路。
    今天的问题，是必需“继往”，放弃了几千年祖先们辛勤劳动所得的宝贵文化积累是不对的。也必需“开来”，不从各方面吸收养料来丰富国画，使国画本身从形式到内容，都能够自由地发展，自由地描写时代人民心里的喜怒哀乐，就不可能产生更多的更伟大的时代艺术，那怎样对得起这时代，算是这时代的子孙呢？白石先生可能活到一百二十岁，但今天还需要有继承和发展他的艺术的人，而且时代也在不断进展中，更需要有表现今天和明天的优良作品产生出来，固然我们今天重要的是保存和发展优良传统，没有这一着，将使我国艺术失去重要的源泉。但只墨守着过去的成规，或者不能领会其精神，只守着枯朽的骸骨，高一层的也只满足于祖先和前辈们的成就，而不求更好的变化和发展，则这一传统，将落后于时代，优良传统也就可能无法保持，这是我们所必须警惕的。
    此次世界和平理事会把国际和平奖金赠与齐先生这一件事，至少可说明世界上爱好和平的国家民族，是同时爱好我国国画的。我们应该除齐先生的作品外，有更多更好的国画伸出头来。同爱好和平的国家民族见面，以副他们的期望，并以准备迎接我们即将到来的文化高潮。这是不论老年中年青年画家都有责任的，都应该努力的。
    末了，我还想说说，近日论国画的人，颇反对文人画，几乎认为是一种毒害，我认为是不必这样看的。从前所谓文人画，是对于职业画家而言，就是说不以绘画为职业的人，以余暇从事绘画的一种标志，其中高下优劣，各有不同，但因其学问事功，别有表现，又多具有风流文采，故总予以此称，其中从事界画、工笔或善于写实者亦均有之，并非都是信手涂抹，没有内容的。又工于书法的人，又往往融书入画，别有风味，这至少也可说是艺术传统之一或优良传统之一。因西洋人不讲书法，故绘画中无融书入画之说，甚至无法了解，但似乎不能因西洋绘画不与书法相通，遂谓我国艺术中，亦不能含有这种血脉，且直谓文人画是一种坏东西而悬为大戒，禁之学习，是等于花草中的兰菊，乐器中的琴箫，因其香韵清逸，易为文人学士所赏爱，遂将兰菊琴箫，摒出花草乐器之列，不许使用，这不但不是吸取菁英的道理反而自隘门户了。即如白石先生的成就，显然是受到文人画的较深影响的，而且并未有碍齐先生的艺术的发展，相反的恰好助成齐先生的独特风格。这就说明了接受遗产，是要经过选择和提炼的，说明了“百花齐放，百家争鸣”对于艺术的发展，只有好处，没有坏处。我相信齐先生的成就，只是中国国画辉煌发展的一个开端。在祝贺齐先生的同时，我有信心向中国国画界前途，予以无限乐观的展望与期待。
