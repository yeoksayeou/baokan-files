Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, September 21st: Echeng County, Hubei Province, held a three-level cadre meeting of the county, districts, and townships from September 8th to 17th. The meeting exposed and criticized the commandism and subjectivist work styles existing among some rural work cadres, and arranged for work during the winter sowing period this year.

After the realization of agricultural cooperativization in Echeng County this spring, one of the most prominent manifestations of subjectivist work style in rural work over the past six months has been the blind promotion of northeastern japonica rice seeds in 300,000 mu of paddy fields, resulting in a decrease of more than 13 million jin in the county's early rice yield compared to last year. In some areas, when formulating autumn harvest distribution plans, a few cadres concocted plans behind closed doors, not allowing the masses to discuss them democratically. The masses said of them, "Accountants plus abacuses, plans are made overnight, centralized yet democratic, cadres are informed halfway."

At this meeting, subjectivism and commandism were exposed. The cadres present conducted self-criticism, and five good cadres who have consistently been good at listening to the opinions of the masses and promoting democratic work styles were commended. The meeting believed that the main reason for these errors was that cadres at all levels were not concerned enough about the hardships of the masses. When county-level party and government leading departments assigned tasks to district and township cadres, they did not proceed from reality, and the various work plans they formulated often had a great deal of blindness; and district and township cadres, in order to complete the tasks, rarely relied on the wisdom and strength of the masses to do things, often treating the masses with a simple, impatient, and paternalistic attitude. The meeting decided that in the future, organizations at all levels should promote a democratic work style and care about the lives and hardships of the masses. Before making decisions on major issues, they should solicit opinions from below, and the arrangement of various tasks must also be adapted to local conditions.

Drawing on the experiences and lessons of the previous stage of work, the meeting arranged for work during the winter sowing period this year. Prior to this, the county-level party and government departments broke with convention, conducted investigations in typical townships and cooperatives, and held forums with experienced farmers, after which they initially formulated the county's winter sowing production plan for this year. At this meeting, they also changed the previous practice of assigning tasks at each level, mobilized the cadres present to engage in democratic discussions on the plan, and made appropriate revisions based on the specific conditions of each area. The meeting also made arrangements for other work during the winter sowing period, requiring all localities to return the autumn harvest plans previously formulated by cadres to the masses for discussion and revision. The upgrading and merging of cooperatives in various localities also requires full promotion of democracy and adherence to the principle of voluntariness.

Xinhua News Agency, Nehe, September 22nd: The CCP Nehe County Committee held a meeting of party member cadres at the section chief level and above from the 18th to the 20th to study the documents of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China. Combining this with the materials obtained from the investigation and research conducted by various units in the countryside over the past month, they continued to deeply criticize subjectivism and bureaucraticism in leadership.

At the meeting of party member cadres, Li Da, secretary of the county party committee, made a self-criticism of the county party committee's subjective and one-sided approach in leading cooperative work by neglecting the leadership of animal husbandry and sideline production, and the bureaucratic work style of not caring about the lives and hardships of the peasant masses. He said that in the past eight years, the income from rural sideline occupations in Nehe County has accounted for more than 20% of the total agricultural income, but this year it has fallen to 8%. The county's animal husbandry has experienced a serious decline. The total number of livestock in the county has decreased by 7.1% compared to the same period last year, and pigs have decreased by about 10%. At the meeting, the director of the county supply and marketing cooperative also reviewed the error of downgrading and reducing prices for more than 20 kinds of products in the procurement of agricultural and sideline products, which resulted in tight markets and farmer dissatisfaction, and put forward specific measures to correct this error. In addition, many party member cadres reviewed and criticized the bureaucratic work style of the county leading organs, which included too many meetings, too many documents, too many forms and reports, and too few in-depth investigations at the grassroots level, and put forward many rational suggestions for improving work. Some party member cadres also made self-criticisms of their own ideological complacency, expressing that they would continue to deeply examine their thinking and improve their work through conscientiously studying the documents of the Eighth National Congress of the Party.

Currently, the CCP Nehe County Committee is drafting a decision on overcoming subjectivism and bureaucraticism and strengthening investigation and research work based on the spirit of the various reports of the Eighth National Congress of the Party and the opinions of party member cadres. This decision will establish the practice of leading cadres regularly going deep into the grassroots to conduct investigation and research as a fixed system. It has also been decided to immediately send a large number of cadres to the countryside to help cooperatives do a good job in the autumn harvest distribution work, promptly correct the various shortcomings and errors that have been discovered, and at the same time do a good job in investigating and researching some important issues.

    检查主观主义和强迫命令作风
    湖北鄂城县三级干部会议决定发扬民主作风
    中共讷河县委召开会议学习党的第八次代表大会文件
    新华社武汉21日电　湖北省鄂城县在9月8日到17日召开了县、区、乡三级干部会议。会议揭露并批判了当前某些农村工作干部中存在的强迫命令、主观主义思想作风，并安排了今年冬播期间的工作。
    鄂城县今年春季实现农业合作化以后，半年来农村工作中，主观主义作风的突出表现之一，是在三十万亩水田中，盲目推广东北的粳稻种子，使全县早稻产量比去年减少了一千三百万斤以上。某些地区在制定秋收分配方案时，少数干部闭门编造方案，不让群众来民主讨论，群众说他们，“会计加算盘，一夜订方案，集中又民主，干部通一半。”
    这次会议上揭露了主观主义和强迫命令作风，到会干部进行了自我检查，同时表扬了五个一贯善于倾听群众意见，发扬民主作风的好干部。会议认为：产生这些错误的主要原因是各级干部对群众的疾苦不够关心。县级党政领导部门向区、乡干部布置任务时，不从实际出发，制定的各项工作计划往往带有很大的盲目性；而区、乡干部为了完成任务，也很少依靠群众智慧和力量来办事，动辄以简单急躁家长式的态度来对待群众。会议决定今后各级组织要发扬民主作风，关心群众生活疾苦。对重大问题作出决定前要征求下面意见，布置各项工作也必须因时因地制宜。
    吸取前一阶段工作中的经验与教训，会议安排了今年冬播期间的工作。在这以前，县级党政部门打破惯例，在对典型乡、社作了调查，并召集老农座谈以后，初步制定了今年全县的冬播生产计划。这次会上又改变了以往层层分配任务的做法，发动到会干部对计划展开民主讨论，根据各地具体情况作了适当的修改。会议对冬播期间其他工作也分别作了布置，要求各地将过去干部包办制定的秋收方案重新交给群众讨论修订。各地的升级并社工作也要求充分发扬民主，坚持自愿原则。
    新华社讷河22日电　中共讷河县委员会18日到20日召开科长以上党员干部会议，学习中共第八次全国代表大会文件，并结合最近一个月中各单位下乡调查研究所得的材料，继续深入地批判领导上的主观主义和官僚主义作风。
    在党员干部会议上，县委书记李达对县委在领导合作社工作中忽视畜牧业和副业生产领导的主观、片面做法和不关心农民群众生活疾苦的官僚主义作风作了自我批评。他说，讷河县过去八年中的农村副业收入都占农业总收入的20％以上，而今年却下降到8％。全县畜牧业有严重衰退现象，全县的牲畜总数比去年同期减少了7.1％，猪减少了10％左右。会上，县供销社主任还检查了在农副产品采购工作中对二十多种产品压级压价的错误，以致造成市场紧张、农民不满的状况，并且提出了纠正这个错误的具体措施。另外，许多党员干部对县领导机关会议多、文件多、表报多和深入基层调查少的官僚主义作风进行了检查和批判，提出了许多改进工作的合理化建议。一些党员干部还对自己思想上的骄傲自满情绪作了自我批评，表示要从认真地学习党的第八次全国代表大会的文件中继续深入地检查思想，改进工作。
    目前，中共讷河县委员会正在根据党的第八次全国代表大会的各项报告精神和党员干部的意见，草拟关于克服主观主义、官僚主义和加强调查研究工作的决定。这个决定将把领导干部定期深入基层做调查研究工作当成一个制度固定下来。还决定立即派大批干部下乡，通过帮助合作社做好秋收分配工作，及时纠正已经发现的各种缺点和错误，并同时做好一些重要问题的调查研究工作。
