	A Way to Make Money
	Among the people of Colombia in South America, there is a story circulating: Once, President Rojas visited a ranch and expressed his desire to buy a fat bull from the ranch owner. The following is a dialogue from that time:
	Owner: "I can't accept money, I'll give one to the President as a gift."
	Rojas shrugged: "I'm the President and cannot accept gifts."
	Owner: "Then, I'll sell you one for one peso." Rojas paid the owner a five-peso bill.
	Owner: "Mr. President, I don't have change for you."
	Rojas: "That's alright, just give me four more bulls!"

	The Use of Eyelashes
	In the past, crime detection was generally based on fingerprints. However, Japan has recently added a new weapon for solving cases. It is said that a Japanese ophthalmologist named Tadashi Fujimatsu believes that everyone's eyelashes are different and can be used to identify people. This expert has now collected more than 20,000 eyelashes and conducted experiments.

    国际点滴
    生财有道
    在南美洲哥伦比亚人民中间，流传着这样一个故事，有一回，总统罗哈斯参观一个牧场，他向牧场主人表示愿意购买一头肥壮公牛。下面是当时的一段对话：
    主人：“我不能收钱，我送一头给总统阁下当礼物”。
    罗哈斯耸耸肩：“我是总统，不能接受礼物”。
    主人：“那么，我以一比索价钱卖给您一头”。罗哈斯付给主人一张五比索的钞票。
    主人：“总统先生，我没有零钱找你”。
    罗哈斯：“没有关系，再给我四头牛好啦”！
    睫毛的用途
    过去，侦察犯罪行为一般是根据指纹。但是，最近日本又增加了一种新的破案武器，据说，一位名叫藤松正的日本眼科专家认为，人类睫毛每人不同，可以用它来鉴别人物，现在这位专家已搜集了两万根以上的睫毛，并且作了试验。
