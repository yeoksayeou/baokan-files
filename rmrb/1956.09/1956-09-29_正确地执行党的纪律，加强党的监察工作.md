Comrade Liu Lantao, Deputy Secretary of the Central Supervisory Committee of the CPC, spoke:

I fully agree with the Central Committee's political report, the draft Party Constitution and the report on the revision of the Party Constitution, and the proposal and report on the Second Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy.

The Central Committee's political report vividly records the history of our Party's new victories and development. Under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, our Party has achieved a great victory of world significance for Marxism-Leninism in a country with 600 million people. This victory of our Party was not easily obtained. It was the result of our Party adhering to the principles of Marxism-Leninism in ideology, politics, and organization, and waging victorious struggles against all erroneous thoughts and actions that violated these principles. While carrying out a long period of revolutionary struggle, our Party experienced various complex ideological and political struggles within the Party, including such serious struggles as the correction of the four opportunist lines. It was precisely in these struggles that our Party established the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, making our Party a politically mature Marxist-Leninist party; at the same time, on the basis of ideological and political unity, our Party also forged the strict discipline necessary for the revolution.

The Party's Discipline Wages Unremitting Struggle Against Non-Working-Class Ideological Styles That Corrode the Party

Our Party has always believed that resolving the contradiction between the working-class ideology and the non-working-class ideology, mainly the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideologies, within the Party is a fundamental issue in our Party's construction. The emergence of various erroneous tendencies within the Party, in terms of its social origins, mainly reflects the erosion and influence of the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideological styles on the Party. Some unswerving members and those whose thoughts have not been well reformed are always easily affected by this influence, or they themselves bring this influence into the Party in various forms. The victory or failure, advancement or retreat of our Party largely depends on whether our Party can effectively prevent and overcome this erosion. However, some people within our Party are not clear about this point. Especially in the current period, because our Party is in a ruling position and has achieved significant achievements in various aspects of work, and the people praise us, some people within the Party begin to indulge themselves by exaggerating their achievements and beautifying our environment too much, and adopt a nonchalant attitude towards the shortcomings and errors in our ranks. In their work, they only want to talk about achievements and are unwilling to talk about shortcomings and errors, burying themselves in daily affairs and ignoring political and ideological struggle. This tendency actually ignores the inevitability and long-term nature of the erosion of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideology on the Party, loses the vigilance that a Communist should have, and as a result, will make it impossible for our Party to prevent and overcome errors well in the future.

Our Party is a great, correct, and glorious Marxist-Leninist party. Since the Zunyi Conference of the Party in 1935, the Party's line has been correct. Under the leadership of the Party's correct line, all comrades of the Party have worked hard and actively, and have been tempered by the great revolutionary struggle. The vast majority of our Party members are serving the people seriously and diligently in accordance with the Party's principles and policies, and are worthy of the glorious title of Communist Party member. But this does not mean that we have not made mistakes in our work, absolutely not! We have made temporary and local mistakes more than once, and there is still the possibility of making various mistakes in the future. It is worth noting that after our Party came to power, erroneous tendencies and violations of laws and disciplines among Party members have grown to some extent. For example, some people have developed pride and privilege thinking due to victory, acting like overlords, regarding the areas and departments they lead as their personal capital and independent kingdoms, or believing that the business technology they manage is a special kind of work that the Party is not capable of leading, refusing the Party's leadership; some people even engage in factional activities within the Party, giving out official positions and making promises, abusing their power, engaging in sectarian activities, vying for leadership power, and undermining Party unity. Gao Gang and Rao Shushi were typical figures of this kind. Some people have also become infected with bureaucratic habits in their work, being high above, only acting as officials and not doing things, or implementing coercion and commandism against the masses, thus often causing many dereliction of duty, turning many good things into bad things, and seriously separating the Party from the masses. Another is suppressing criticism, and even carrying out打击报复against critics. Xiang Ming, the former acting secretary of the Shandong Branch Bureau, in order to cover up his anti-Party and anti-Central activities, once carried out this kind of打击报复against dozens of responsible cadres, and later wrote false reports to deceive the Central Committee. This extremely bad anti-Party style strangled democracy inside and outside the Party and the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses, causing major damage to the Party's cause. There are also some cadres who put the interests of their unit or individuals above the interests of the state, and cater to some leaders' preferences for only hearing about achievements and not wanting to hear about shortcomings, adopting a disloyal attitude of double-dealing and falsifying reports towards the tasks of the Party and the state, intentionally making false reports, concealing the truth from the Party, exaggerating achievements, and even fabricating production achievements and model worker deeds, fabricating or impersonating others' "advanced work experience" in order to obtain honor and bonuses; some bureaucrats and factionalists intentionally or unintentionally encourage this behavior. In addition, people who are corrupt and degenerate, destroy communist morality, and even degenerate politically have been constantly discovered in the Party.

The above erroneous facts illustrate that the decadent things such as the ideological style, political means, and living habits of the exploiting classes formed on the basis of the long-standing exploiting system will not stop eroding our Party. If we relax the struggle against these things, relax our vigilance against our own shortcomings and errors, it will inevitably cause serious bad consequences for the Party and the people's cause. All this also shows that strengthening the Party's political and ideological work, carrying out criticism and self-criticism, strengthening the Party's organization, and strictly enforcing Party discipline are of particularly important significance in the current period.

The Party's Rectification Movement is a Movement to Strengthen the Party's Organization and Discipline on the Basis of the Consciousness of Party Members and the Masses

Our Party has learned to use the method of rectification to overcome errors within the Party. In most cases, Party members make mistakes due to errors in ideological understanding. In most cases, inner-Party struggle is basically an ideological struggle and an educational issue. Therefore, only by using the method of rectification to solve the ideological problems of the broad masses of Party members, clarifying right and wrong ideologically, can Party members make fewer mistakes and effectively reduce the space for erroneous thinking within the Party. The Party's rectification movement is the Party's Marxist-Leninist education movement, the Party's criticism and self-criticism movement, and a movement to strengthen the Party's organization and discipline on the basis of the consciousness of Party members and the masses. Our Party has systematically conducted criticism of bourgeois ideology and idealist ideology among Party members, has implemented a system of rotating cadres for study, and has decided to re-study the Party's historical documents on rectification within the Party, particularly focusing on opposing subjectivism and advocating ideological construction that combines theory with practice. All this will make our Party more powerful in preventing errors and correcting errors in a timely manner.

The policy adopted by our Party to overcome errors within the Party has proven to be completely correct. This policy is the one advocated by Comrade Mao Zedong: "Learn from past mistakes to avoid future ones, and cure the sickness to save the patient," "Both clarify the ideology and unite the comrades," combining the correct conduct of inner-Party struggle with the correct maintenance of inner-Party unity.

The problem of errors and shortcomings within the Party, the problem of disputes within the Party, are mostly ideological problems, that is, problems of understanding, problems of right and wrong, but there are also problems of the enemy and ourselves, and errors have different natures and degrees. Therefore, when our Party implements this policy, it must first draw clear lines for various problems, draw a clear line between inner-Party problems and problems outside the Party, draw a clear line between the enemy and ourselves, a clear line between good people and bad people, and a clear line between various rights and wrongs, and treat them differently in a realistic manner. The Party resolutely cleans out of the Party the few counter-revolutionaries and other bad elements who have infiltrated the Party once they are discovered. This struggle is different in nature from general inner-Party struggle. In inner-Party struggle, our Party generally distinguishes between two different situations and adopts two different attitudes towards errors committed by Party members. That is: for those who engage in activities that split the Party and harm the Party and persist in not correcting them, the Party must give them due sanctions, up to expulsion from the Party. However, for those who have committed errors that can be corrected within the Party and who are willing to correct them, the Party adopts the policy of curing the sickness to save the patient, keeping them in the Party for education and helping them to correct their errors.

Our Party is a Marxist-Leninist party. Therefore, our Party is completely different from the life-and-death relationship between the bourgeoisie and its political parties. We must adopt an attitude of wholeheartedly helping and "being kind to people" towards the errors that occur in comrades within the Party. Everyone can make mistakes, and everyone needs help from others. Therefore, as long as this error belongs to the nature of the Party, we only have the obligation to help the comrades who have made mistakes with full enthusiasm and to the best of our ability, so that they can be freed from their errors, and we have no right to despise them, attack them, not allow them to correct their errors, or not allow them to make revolution. Whether or not this can be done is an important indicator of whether a Party member's Party spirit is pure and whether the Party organization's measures are in line with the spirit of Marxism-Leninism. For those who have made mistakes, we must not only appropriately clarify the points of disagreement between them and the Party, draw a line with them in principle, but also see what common points they still maintain with the Party, instead of negating everything. Only in this way can we help people clarify right and wrong and correct their errors with a principled attitude, so as to avoid being vague and perfunctory, and not harm comrades.

Of course, this does not mean that our Party can retain those who have been helped repeatedly within the Party but still persist in not correcting their errors and have completely lost the conditions of a Communist Party member without principle. There is a saying in the Party now that since our Party implements a lenient policy towards counter-revolutionaries in society and a policy of peaceful transformation towards bourgeois elements, it seems that in the Party, for those who have committed serious violations of discipline and laws, regardless of the nature of the problem, they should all be treated "leniently," and those who have lost the qualifications of Party members can also live peacefully with them. Obviously, this is a right-leaning view that mixes the Party's social policies and the Party's construction issues without principle. This view is equivalent to lowering our Party to a level lower than an ordinary social group.

The Party's Strict Discipline is Built on the Basis of Ideological and Political Unity

Our Party is a unified fighting organization linked together by the discipline that all Party members must abide by. The Party's strict discipline is built on the basis of the Party's ideological and political unity. The higher the ideological consciousness of Party members, the more politically mature Party members are, the more consciously and willingly they will abide by discipline, and the stronger the Party's organization and discipline will be. Therefore, the regular and main method of correcting Party members' errors and strengthening Party discipline can only be to strengthen inner-Party education, improve Party members' theoretical and political level, and unfold inner-Party criticism and self-criticism, rather than abusing disciplinary sanctions. In the past, those who committed "left" leaning line errors in the Party violated this principle and used disciplinary sanctions to replace inner-Party education and inner-Party criticism and self-criticism, and committed serious mistakes of punishmentism. As a result, the more punishments there were, the worse the Party's discipline became, the more problems there were in the Party, and the more disunited the Party became. At present, in some places there is still a phenomenon of excessive and heavy punishment of Party members on some issues. The main reason for this phenomenon is often because some non-principled issues are exaggerated to the height of principle, and even things that are not considered errors at all are exaggerated into errors. Some people also use the Party's organizational discipline as a tool for coercion and commandism in the execution of certain tasks, resulting in various bad consequences in their work. This is actually a manifestation of punishmentism. But on the other hand, there is also this phenomenon in the Party at present, that is, when the errors of some Party members have developed to the point of seriously violating Party discipline and state laws and discipline must be enforced, they are not given the disciplinary sanctions they deserve, and some people even use various excuses to forcibly say that enforcing Party discipline in this situation is a negative bad thing. This is a tendency of unprincipled liberalism. Wherever this tendency exists, various errors and violations of laws and disciplines within the Party will develop, evil will prevail, righteousness will not rise, the Party will be separated from the masses, and even the errors will spread, leading to the punishment of more people within the Party. Doing so is not only detrimental to the Party's cause, but also of no benefit to those who have made mistakes.

Party's Supervisory Staff at All Levels are Equally Bound by Party Discipline

The Party's supervisory organizations at all levels bear a major responsibility for opposing erroneous tendencies and violations of laws and disciplines within the Party and safeguarding Party discipline. The purpose of the Party's supervisory work is to overcome and prevent various negative and destructive factors within the Party, promote positive factors within the Party, or transform negative factors into positive factors. Therefore, this is entirely an active work in the Party's construction. However, those who do supervisory work must not think that those who handle other people's errors will not make mistakes themselves, and those who supervise others can be unsupervised. The Party's supervisory work, like any other work, can make mistakes. If the Party's supervisory staff make mistakes and do not know how to correct them, it will also cause damage to the Party. Therefore, no privilege thinking is allowed in this regard. Our principle must be: supervisors must also be supervised. Because of this, the Party's supervisory work, like any other work of the Party, must be placed under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and the Party committees at all levels.

The Role of Party Discipline is Not Only to Punish People, but Also to Protect People

The role of Party discipline is not only to punish people, but also to protect people. Being punished and correcting mistakes because of education is actually a protection, not an attack; enforcing Party discipline to correct all violations of laws and disciplines is a protection both for the interests of the Party and for the organizations and people harmed by violations of laws and disciplines. Our Party does not allow any Party members or Party organizations to infringe upon the rights of Party members, believing that this is a violation of Party discipline. At present, there are not only acts of suppressing criticism within the Party, but also acts of arbitrarily depriving Party members of the right to defend and appeal. Some people often use "deliberately defending errors" or "not thoroughly admitting errors" and other "charges" to force Party members to give up the right to defend and appeal. This is an act that violates democratic principles and should be thoroughly corrected.

Party Discipline and Creativity are Combined and Promote Each Other

The role of Party discipline is not only to ensure the Party's high degree of centralization and unity, but also to ensure a high degree of democracy within the Party, and to ensure the high degree of initiative and creativity of all cadres and Party members. Party discipline and creativity are combined and promote each other. Party discipline is "unity of action, freedom of discussion and criticism" (Lenin). Party discipline does not restrict Party members' creativity, but truly helps Party members' creativity to be brought into play, and must take the full play of Party members' creativity as a condition for strengthening itself, just as Party spirit does not restrict personality but truly helps the liberation of personality, and must take the liberation of personality as a condition for strengthening itself. In capitalist society, only capital possesses independence and individuality, while the independence and individuality of workers are subject to various restrictions and persecutions. Our working class's conscious unified will and united strength is Party spirit and Party discipline, which truly liberates people's individuality and creative ability, and enables individuals to achieve truly free development in the common life of society; and the liberation of people's individuality and creative ability will also make people take a more conscious and responsible attitude towards revolutionary tasks, so that revolutionary discipline becomes a discipline that people can consciously and willingly abide by.

Strengthening Party Discipline and Promoting Inner-Party Democracy are Consistent

Strengthening Party discipline should never be seen as turning every Party member into a blindly obedient, echoing, timid, and cautious person, making the Party lifeless. This is not strengthening discipline, but implementing a "policy of fooling the people" within the Party. This kind of discipline must not be disguised as our Party's discipline. Our Party's discipline is completely built on the basis of Party members' consciousness. On the other hand, developing inner-Party democracy and giving play to Party members' initiative and creativity are ultimately for the purpose of consolidating Party discipline and enhancing combat effectiveness, not weakening Party discipline and combat effectiveness. The freedom of discussion and criticism within the Party is ultimately for the sake of the Party's unity of action, not to make the Party's actions scattered; otherwise, the so-called "inner-Party democracy" and "freedom of discussion" themselves would lose their meaning. If any Party member has different opinions on the Party's resolutions, they can raise their opinions to the Party's leading organs, and they can still retain their opinions even after the Party has made a final decision, but they must unconditionally implement the Party's resolutions. Whether a Communist Party member has a good Party spirit is particularly manifested in whether they can unconditionally obey the organization and take the overall situation into consideration when they are in a minority position and have a principled disagreement with the Party organization. Our Party has always advocated that every Party member must combine the principle of adhering to the truth with the discipline of obeying the organization, and all struggles within the Party must be carried out in full accordance with the Party's legal procedures. At no time, no Party member or Party organization can take illegal means to carry out struggles. When our Party struggled against the erroneous lines of Wang Ming and Bogu, the comrades in the Party who advocated the correct line did exactly this. Therefore, even when the Party was in such a dangerous environment, it could avoid division, overcome errors, and make the Party advance victoriously.

Educating New Party Members on Party Discipline

In view of the fact that the Party has absorbed millions of new Party members, it is necessary for our Party to explain to them in a comprehensive rather than a one-sided way the relationship between democracy and centralism in the Party, and the relationship between Party discipline and creativity. The higher the awareness of Party discipline of any comrade in the Party, the more they can become a free person and fully develop their personal talents; if they do not have this awareness or if their awareness is not enough, they will feel that Party discipline is somewhat inconvenient and somewhat compulsory for them. This compulsion of Party discipline is precisely to restrain the negative factors in their thinking, help them correct their mistakes, and improve their awareness, so as to give full play to their initiative and creativity in serving the Party and the people.

In the process of working, it is inevitable to make some mistakes in giving play to initiative and creativity. Of course, errors must be corrected, but it is absolutely not allowed to frustrate people's initiative and creativity in their work. Here, the spirit of independent and responsible work should be distinguished from making independence from the Party, the constructive initiatives of advanced producers should be distinguished from the destructive "innovation" that does not obey organizational resolutions, the legitimate exercise of powers should be distinguished from decentralism, and the red tape that shackles the masses should be distinguished from the necessary rules and regulations that ensure the normal progress of work. In addition, the errors made by some loyal Party members due to active work should also be distinguished from the errors made by those who are passively derelict, deliberately violate the Party's policies, or have poor character and style.

Rely on the People to Overcome Shortcomings and Errors

Experience tells us that some errors of Party members are not easy to discover in a timely manner only by relying on the Party organization, while the broad masses of the people can help us expose these errors in a timely manner. In the past, our Party has discovered and handled many major typical cases through letters and visits from the people. The revolutionary enthusiasm of the people in helping the Party to expose certain errors often suffers from the heavy obstruction and打击报复 of bureaucrats and factionalists, and even pays a heavy price for it. Therefore, if we want to overcome various erroneous phenomena within the Party, we must resolutely rely on, encourage, and support the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses who dare to expose errors and fight against all erroneous phenomena.

The cause of our Party is the cause of the people. The people cannot tolerate the existence of errors in our Party and are willing to actively help the Party expose errors, which shows the people's full trust in our Party. Our Party will never fail the people's trust in us, and must unhesitatingly and resolutely overcome the shortcomings and errors in our own ranks, especially the errors of subjectivism, bureaucracy, and sectarianism. Only by doing this can we further gain the trust of the people and obtain unlimited strength to overcome all difficulties and achieve new and greater victories.

    正确地执行党的纪律，加强党的监察工作
    中共中央监察委员会副书记　刘澜涛同志的发言
    我完全同意中央委员会的政治报告、党的章程草案和关于修改党章的报告、关于发展国民经济的第二个五年计划的建议和报告。
    中央委员会的政治报告鲜明地记载了我们党的新的胜利发展的历史。我们党在以毛泽东同志为首的党中央的正确领导下，已经使马克思列宁主义在一个有六万万人口的国家中获得了具有世界意义的伟大胜利。我们党的这个胜利，并不是轻易地获得的，这是由于我们党在思想上、政治上、组织上坚持马克思列宁主义的原则，并且同一切违反这些原则的错误思想和行动作了胜利斗争的结果。我们党在进行长期革命斗争的同时，在党内经历了各种复杂的思想斗争和政治斗争，其中包括像纠正四次机会主义路线那样严重的斗争。我们党正是在这些斗争中，树立了以毛泽东同志为首的党中央的正确领导，使我们党成为一个在政治上成熟的马克思列宁主义的党；同时，在思想政治一致的基础上，我们党也锻炼出了为革命所必需的严格的纪律。
    党的纪律向侵蚀党的非工人阶级思想作风作不懈的斗争
    我们党历来认为解决党内工人阶级思想同非工人阶级思想、主要是同资产阶级思想和小资产阶级思想的矛盾，是我们党的建设中的一个带根本性质的问题。党内各种错误倾向的产生，就其社会根源来说，主要正是反映了资产阶级的、小资产阶级的思想作风对于党的侵蚀和影响，党内一些不坚定的分子和思想没有改造好的分子总是容易接受这种影响，或者是他们自己通过各种形式把这种影响带到党内来，而我们党的胜利或失败，前进或后退，在很大程度上也要取决于我们党是否能够有成效地防止和克服这种侵蚀。可是，对于这点，我们党内有一些人是不清醒的。特别在目前时期，由于我们党已经处于执政地位，各方面的工作取得了重大的成就，人民群众赞扬我们，因此党内就有一些人开始用夸大自己的成就和过于美化我们环境的办法来陶醉自己，对于我们队伍中的缺点和错误采取满不在乎的态度，在工作中只愿意说成绩，不愿意说缺点和错误，埋头于日常事务，而漠视政治思想斗争。这种倾向实际上是忽视资产阶级思想和小资产阶级思想对于党的侵蚀的必然性和长期性，丧失共产党人应有的警惕，结果将会使我们党在今后不能够很好地去预防错误和克服错误。
    我们的党是一个伟大的、正确的、光荣的马克思列宁主义的党。自从一九三五年党的遵义会议以来，党的路线一直是正确的。全党同志在党的正确路线的领导下，艰苦奋斗，积极工作，经受了伟大革命斗争的锻炼。我们的绝大多数党员都是在严肃地、辛勤地按照党的方针和政策为人民服务的，是无愧于光荣的共产党员称号的。但这不是说我们工作中没有犯过错误，决不是这样！暂时的、局部性的错误我们曾经是不止一次地犯过的，今后仍然有犯各种错误的可能。值得注意的是，我们党在执政以后，党员中的错误倾向和违法乱纪现象，有了某种程度的滋长。例如，有一种人，由于胜利而产生了骄傲情绪和特权思想，称王称霸，把自己所领导的地区和部门看作是个人的资本和独立王国，或者认为自己所管理的业务技术是党所没有能力领导的一种特殊的工作，拒绝党的领导；有的人甚至在党内拉拉扯扯，封官许愿，滥用职权，进行宗派活动，争夺领导权力，破坏党内团结。高岗、饶漱石就是这样的典型人物。也有一些人在工作中沾染了官僚主义的习气，高高在上，只作官不办事，或者对群众实行强迫命令，因此往往造成许多失职行为，把不少好事办成了坏事，使党严重地脱离了群众。再一种是压制批评，甚至对批评者实行打击和报复。前山东分局代理书记向明，为了掩盖他的反党反中央的活动，就曾经对几十个负责干部进行了这种打击，事后并写假报告欺骗中央。这种极其恶劣的反党作风，绞杀党内外民主和广大群众的革命积极性，使党的事业受到了重大的损害。还有一种干部，他们把本单位或个人的利益放在国家利益之上，并且逢迎某些领导者只愿意听成绩不愿意听缺点的嗜好，对党和国家的任务采取阳奉阴违、弄虚作假的不忠实态度，有意作假报告，向党隐瞒真情，夸大成绩，甚至凭空捏造生产成绩和劳模事迹、捏造或者假冒别人的“先进工作经验”，以骗取荣誉和奖金；一些官僚主义者和宗派主义者则有意无意地鼓励这种行为。此外，贪污腐化、破坏共产主义道德、一直弄到政治上蜕化变质的人，在党内也曾不断地发现过。
    以上这些错误事实说明了：在历史悠久的剥削制度基础上形成的剥削阶级的思想作风、政治手段和生活习惯等等腐朽的东西，是不会停止对于我们党的侵蚀的。我们如果放松对于这些东西的斗争，放松对于自己的缺点和错误的警惕，那就必然会对党和人民的事业造成严重的恶果。这一切也说明了，加强党的政治思想工作，开展批评和自我批评，严密党的组织，严格党的纪律，在目前时期具有特别重要的意义。
    党的整风运动是在党员群众的自觉基础上，加强党的组织性纪律性的运动
    我们党已经学会了用整风的方式来克服党内的错误。党员犯错误在大多数的情况下是由于思想认识上的错误，党内斗争在大多数的情况下基本上是一种思想斗争和教育问题。因此，只有用整风的办法解决广大党员的思想问题，从思想上辨明是非，才能使党员少犯错误，才能有效地缩小党内错误思想的地盘。党的整风运动，就是党的马克思列宁主义的教育运动，党的批评和自我批评的运动，在党员群众自觉的基础上，加强党的组织性纪律性的运动。我们党曾经有系统地在党员中进行过对资产阶级思想和唯心主义思想的批判，已经实行了干部轮流学习的制度，并且决定在党内重新学习党的整风历史文献，特别着重反对主观主义，提倡理论与实际联系的思想建设工作。这一切，将会使我们党更有力量去预防错误和及时纠正错误。
    我们党为了克服党内错误所采取的方针，事实证明是完全正确的，这个方针就是毛泽东同志所提倡的“惩前毖后，治病救人”，“既要弄清思想，又要团结同志”，使正确地进行党内斗争和正确地保持党内团结结合起来。
    党内的错误缺点问题，党内的争论问题，绝大多数是思想问题，即认识问题，是非问题，但也有敌我问题，而错误又有性质和大小程度的不同，因此，当着我们党在执行这个方针的时候，首先要对于各种问题划清界限，划清党内问题和党外问题的界限，划清敌我界限、好人和坏人的界限，划清各种是非的界限，实事求是地区别对待。党对于少数混入党内的反革命分子和其他坏分子，是一经发现便坚决清洗出党，这种斗争在性质上是不同于一般的党内斗争的。在党内斗争中，我们党对于党员所犯的错误，一般是区别两种不同的情况，采取两种不同的态度，这就是：对于那种进行分裂党危害党的活动而又坚持不改正的分子，党必须给以应有的制裁，直至开除他们出党。但是，对于那些所犯错误可以在党内改正并且本人也愿意改正的人，党都采取治病救人的方针，把他们留在党内加以教育，帮助他们改正错误。
    我们党是马克思列宁主义的党，因此，我们党和资产阶级及其政党内部的你死我活的关系完全不同，对于党内同志发生的错误必须采取尽心帮助和“与人为善”的态度。每个人都可能犯错误，每个人都需要别人帮助。因此，只要这种错误属于党内性质，我们对于犯错误的同志便只有满腔热诚地仁至义尽地去帮助他们、使他们从错误中解放出来的义务，而没有鄙弃他们、打击他们、不允许他们改正错误、不准他们革命的权利。能否做到这一点，是区别一个党员的党性是否纯正、党的组织的措施是否符合马克思列宁主义的精神的一个重要标志。我们对于犯错误的人，不仅要恰当地弄清他们和党之间所发生的分歧点，同他们在原则上划清界限，同时，也还要看到他们和党还保持着那些共同点，而不是否定一切。只有这样，我们才能以原则态度去帮助人弄清是非，改正错误，做到既不含糊敷衍，也不损害同志。
    当然，这不是说我们党对于那些在党内经过再三帮助但仍坚持不改正错误，并且已经完全丧失共产党员条件的人，也可以无原则地把他们保留在党内。现在党内有一种说法，这种说法认为，我们党既然对于社会上的反革命分子实行宽大政策，对于资产阶级分子实行和平改造政策，那么在党内对于犯了严重违法乱纪错误的人，也似乎应当不管问题是什么性质，而一律“从宽”处理，对于已经丧失党员条件的人也可以同他们和平共居。很显然，这是一种把党的社会政策和党的建设问题毫无原则地混淆起来的右倾观点，这种观点等于把我们党降低到比一个普通社会团体还要低的水平。
    党的严格的纪律建筑在思想政治一致的基础上
    我们的党是以一切党员都要遵守的纪律联结起来的统一的战斗组织。党的严格的纪律是建筑在党的思想政治一致的基础上的。党员的思想觉悟愈高，党员在政治上愈成熟，也就愈能自觉自愿地遵守纪律，党的组织性、纪律性也就会愈强。因此，纠正党员错误、加强党内纪律的经常的主要的办法，只能是加强党内教育，提高党员的理论政治水平，展开党内的批评和自我批评，而不是滥用纪律处分。过去党内犯“左”倾路线错误的人，违反这个原则，拿纪律处分去代替党内教育和党内的批评与自我批评，曾经犯过严重的惩办主义错误，结果是惩办越多，党的纪律越坏，党内的问题也越多，党内越不团结。目前有些地方在某些问题上仍然有处分党员过多过重的现象，造成这种现象的主要原因，常常是由于把一些非原则的问题夸大化地提到原则的高度，甚至把一些根本不算错误的事情夸大成为错误。也有一些人在执行某些任务中拿党的组织纪律作为强迫命令的工具，以致在工作中造成种种恶果。这实际上是惩办主义的一种表现。但是另一方面，目前在党内也有这种现象，这就是当着某些党员的错误已经发展到严重违反党纪国法而必须执行纪律的时候，也不给以应得的纪律处分，有的人甚至用各种借口把在这种情况下执行党的纪律，硬说成是消极性的坏事。这是一种无原则的自由主义倾向。凡有这种倾向的地方，那里党内的各种错误和违法乱纪现象就得到发展，邪气嚣张，正气不升，使党脱离群众，甚至使错误蔓延开来，以致弄到在党内处分更多的人。这样做不仅对党的事业不利，对犯错误者本人也是毫无好处的。
    党的各级监察工作人员同样受党的纪律的约束
    党的各级监察组织，对于反对党内错误倾向和违法乱纪现象，维护党的纪律，担负着重大的责任。党的监察工作的目的是为着在党内克服和防止各种消极因素和破坏因素，发扬党内的积极因素，或者使消极因素转变为积极因素。因此，这完全是党的建设中的一项积极性的工作。但是，做监察工作的人决不能以为处理别人错误的人自己就不会犯错误，监察别人的人自己就可以不受人监察。党的监察工作同其他任何工作一样是会犯错误的，党的监察工作人员如果犯了错误而又不知改正，那就同样会对党造成损害。因此，在这方面决不容许有任何特权思想。我们的原则必须是：监察者同样要受监察。正因为这样，党的监察工作也同党的其他任何工作一样，必须放在党的中央和党的各级委员会的领导之下。
    党的纪律的作用，不只是处分人，同时也是保护人
    党的纪律的作用，绝不只是处分人，同时也是保护人。被处分的人因为受到教育而改正错误，这实际是一种保护，而不是打击；执行党的纪律来纠正一切违法乱纪现象，这无论对于党的利益和被违法乱纪分子所损害的组织和人们说来，都是一种保护。我们党对于任何党员和党的组织侵害党员权利的行为都是不容许的，认为这是一种违犯党的纪律的行为。目前，党内不仅有压制批评的行为，而且还有任意地剥夺党员申辩和申诉权利的行为，一些人往往用“故意辩护错误”或“承认错误不彻底”等“罪名”，去逼使党员放弃申辩和申诉的权利。这是一种违反民主原则的行为，应当彻底加以改正。
    党的纪律性和创造性是互相结合、又互相促进的
    党的纪律的作用，不仅仅是保障党的高度集中统一，同时也是保障党内的高度民主，保障全体干部和党员的积极性和创造性的高度发挥。党的纪律性和创造性是互相结合、又互相促进的。党的纪律，就是“行动的一致，讨论和批评的自由”（列宁）。党的纪律不是束缚党员的创造性而是真正有助于党员创造性的发挥，并且要以党员的创造性的充分发挥为加强自己的条件，正好像党性不是束缚个性而是真正有助于个性的解放，并且要以个性解放为加强自己的条件一样。在资本主义社会里，只有资本拥有独立性和个性，而劳动者的独立性和个性是受着各种限制和迫害的。我们工人阶级自觉的统一的意志和团结一致的力量，就是党性和党的纪律性，它把人们的个性和创造能力真正解放了出来，使个人在社会的共同生活中得到真正自由的发展；而人们的个性和创造能力的解放，也就会使人们对于革命任务采取更加自觉的和更加负责的态度，从而使革命的纪律成为人们能够自觉自愿遵守的纪律。
    加强党的纪律性和发扬党内民主是一致的
    加强党的纪律性，绝不应该也不能看作是把每一个党员都弄成盲目服从、随声附和、唯唯诺诺、谨小慎微的人，使党内毫无生气。这不是加强纪律，而是在党内实行“愚民政策”。决不能把这样的纪律冒充为我们党的纪律。我们党的纪律乃是完全建筑在党员自觉基础上的纪律。另一方面，发展党内民主，发挥党员的积极性创造性，归根到底是为着巩固党的纪律和增强战斗力，而不是削弱党的纪律和战斗力，党内讨论和批评的自由，归根到底是为着党的行动一致，而不是使党的行动涣散；否则，所谓“党内民主”和“讨论自由”本身也就失掉了意义。任何党员如果对于党的决议有不同意见的地方，可以向党的领导机关提出自己的意见，并且还可以在党作出最后决定后，仍然保留自己的意见，但是对党的决议必须无条件地执行。一个共产党员是否具有好的党性，特别表现在当他处于少数地位、处于同党的组织发生了原则分歧的时候，是否能够无条件地服从组织、顾全大局。我们党一向提倡每个党员必须把坚持真理的原则性和服从组织的纪律性结合起来，党内一切斗争必须完全按照党的合法手续进行，任何时候，任何党员和党的组织都决不能采取非法手段去进行。我们党在同王明、博古错误路线作斗争的时候，党内主张正确路线的同志们正是这样做的，因此，党即使处于那样险恶的环境，也能避免分裂，克服错误，使党胜利前进。
    向新党员进行党的纪律的教育
    鉴于目前党吸收了几百万新党员，我们党有必要向他们全面地而不是片面地讲清楚党的民主和集中的关系，党的纪律性和创造性的关系。党内任何一个同志，党的纪律性的觉悟愈高，他们也就愈能成为一个自由的人，充分地发挥个人的才能；如果没有这种觉悟或者觉悟不够，就感觉到党的纪律对于他们有些不便，有些强制性。党的纪律的这种强制性正是为着制止他们思想中的消极因素，帮助他们改正错误，提高觉悟，以便充分发挥他们为党为人民服务的积极性和创造性。
    在工作过程中发挥积极性和创造性，犯一些错误是不可避免的。有错误当然要纠正，但是决不可以挫折人们在工作中的积极性和创造性。这里应当将独立负责工作的精神同向党闹独立性加以区别，将先进生产者们的建设性的创议同不服从组织决议的破坏性的“标新立异”加以区别，将正当的行使职权同分散主义加以区别，将束缚群众手脚的清规戒律同保证工作正常进行的必需的规程条例加以区别。此外，也还应当将一些忠实的党员因为积极工作而犯的错误，同那些消极失职、故意违反党的政策或因品质作风恶劣而犯的错误加以区别。
    依靠人民群众克服缺点和错误
    经验告诉我们：党员的某些错误，仅仅依靠党的组织，还是不容易及时发现的，而广大的人民群众则能够帮助我们及时揭露这些错误。我们党过去通过人民群众的来信来访，已经发现并且处理了不少重大的典型案件。人民群众帮助党揭露某些错误，往往要受到官僚主义者和宗派主义者的重重阻难和打击，甚至为此付出了重大的代价。因此，我们要克服党内的各种错误现象，就必须坚决地依靠、鼓励和支持广大群众的这种勇于揭发错误、同一切错误现象作斗争的革命积极性。
    我们党的事业是人民群众的事业。人民群众不能容忍我们党内存在错误并且愿意积极帮助党揭露错误，这正是表明人民群众对我们党的充分信任。我们党也决不辜负人民群众对于我们的信任，而必须毫不迟疑地坚决地克服自己队伍中的缺点和错误，特别是主观主义、官僚主义和宗派主义的错误。我们只有这样做了，才能更进一步取得人民群众的信任，才能获得无限的力量去战胜一切困难，取得新的更大的胜利。
