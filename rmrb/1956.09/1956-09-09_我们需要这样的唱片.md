    We Need Records Like These
    The demands of the broad masses for cultural life are diverse. We welcome every new drama, every newly published book and magazine, and every new, moving song and movement. But recently I have heard more and more people say: It's a real pity that you can't buy good instrumental records (this refers to records for appreciating music other than dance music).
    In recent years, cultural exchanges between China and foreign countries have been frequent. Visits and performances by many foreign experts have introduced us to the works of many world-famous musicians such as Tchaikovsky, Beethoven, and Glinka, leaving us with a deep impression.
    Now that China has formally established the Central Philharmonic Orchestra and other orchestras, it is hoped that they can record the works of world-famous musicians they perform and release them as records to further enrich our musical life and knowledge. Xiao Ling

    我们需要这样的唱片
    广大群众对文化生活的要求是多种多样的。我们欢迎每一出新剧，欢迎每一本新出的书、杂志，也欢迎每一首新的动人心弦的歌曲和乐章。但近来我却越来越多地听到人说：真遗憾，买不到好的器乐唱片（这是指舞曲以外的乐曲欣赏唱片）。
    近年来中外文化交流活动频繁，许多外国专家的访问演出，介绍给我们很多世界著名的音乐家如柴可夫斯基、贝多芬、格林卡等的作品，给我们留下了很深的印象。
    现在我国已正式成立了中央乐团，和其他的管弦乐队，希望能将他们演奏的世界著名音乐家的乐曲灌成唱片发行，进一步丰富我们的音乐生活和知识。　　　　小铃
