    "Checked Over"
    "Checks occur every few days, but after checking, they don't manage anything." In the rural areas of the Yanzihe District in Jinzhai County, Anhui, each production check can be described as comprehensive, in-depth, and meticulous. Each production team has to spend half a day or even a full day of production time for one to three or five full laborers. However, after the check is completed, the numbers are added and subtracted, and a report is submitted to the district, and that's it. No one considers how to utilize these materials. In April of this year, a responsible cadre from the county came to assign work and personally drafted a checklist with 424 items. To fill out this form, each production team assigned five or six cadres, spending more than a day. The entire district used approximately five to six hundred labor days for this check. People believed that this check was determined to solve some problems. However, this responsible cadre came and went in a hurry, and now these materials are still hidden in the district committee's boxes, becoming expensively purchased waste products.

    “检查过了”
    “隔不几天就检查，检查过了不管它”。在安徽金寨县燕子河区的农村里，每次的生产检查，可以称谓全面、深入、细致，每个生产队得花上一个到三、五个整劳力半天以至一天的生产时间。可是，检查完了，数字加加减减，向区里一报，就算完事。至于怎样去利用这些材料，却没人考虑。今年4月份，县里有一位负责干部来布置工作，亲自动手拟了一张有四百二十四个项目的检查表。为了填这张表，每个生产队都抽出五、六个干部，花了一天多时间。全区用于这次检查的大约有五百到六百个劳动日。人们相信这次检查一定是下决心要解决一些问题了。可是，这位负责干部来也匆匆，去也匆匆，到现在这些材料还都藏在区委会的箱子里，成为高价收来的废品。
