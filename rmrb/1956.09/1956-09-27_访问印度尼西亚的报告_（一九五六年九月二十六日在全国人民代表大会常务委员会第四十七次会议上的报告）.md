Report on a Visit to Indonesia
(Report at the 47th Meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on September 26, 1956)
Song Qingling, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress

My trip to visit Indonesia at the invitation of President Sukarno and the Indonesian government was originally scheduled for July. However, I was delayed in Kunming due to illness for some days, and it was not until the afternoon of August 13th that I flew to Indonesia from Yangon, arriving in Jakarta at 1:00 AM on the 14th. I departed to return to China on the 23rd.

During the ten-day itinerary, we visited Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia, Bandung, famous for the Asian-African Conference, Yogyakarta, the ancient cultural capital and heroic city of revolution, and Bali, known as the "Island of Poetry." We were invited to attend the 11th anniversary celebration of Indonesia's independence, attended a special session of the parliament, and a welcome rally by the citizens of Jakarta. We had the opportunity to have friendly contact with Indonesian politicians, prominent figures from all walks of life, and women leaders, and also received representatives of overseas Chinese from various places.

This visit left me with a pleasant and deep impression. We received a warm welcome in this friendly neighboring country. We saw Indonesia's beautiful and rich natural environment, as well as the determination and strength of the Indonesian people in building their own country. We also saw the growing friendship between the people of Indonesia and China. We were honored to have the opportunity to express the sentiments of the Chinese people to our neighbors, the people of Indonesia, and were delighted to be able to convey the impressions we gained in Indonesia and the friendship of the Indonesian people to the Chinese people. This feeling made me more deeply aware of the great value of this unforgettable visit and the friendship between the Chinese and Indonesian people.

In Jakarta

At 1:00 AM on August 14th, when our plane landed at Jakarta airport, under the strong light of searchlights, we were greeted by Indonesian government leaders, headed by Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo and his wife, as well as prominent figures from all walks of life, diplomatic envoys, and representatives of overseas Chinese. Outside the airport, tens of thousands of people crowded the road, making it almost impossible for cars to pass. Among the crowd were Indonesians and overseas Chinese, and it was said that many people had been standing on the street since 9:00 PM, waiting until 1:00 AM. I was deeply moved by their enthusiasm.

At 1:30 AM, we arrived at the hall of the presidential palace, Istana Merdeka, and were warmly and cordially welcomed by President Sukarno and Vice President Hatta and their wives. The first thing President Sukarno said when he met me was, "You finally came!" At 2:00 AM, I was invited to rest at the State Palace. In reality, it was difficult to rest peacefully under this series of exciting scenes. Not long after dawn, we started our activities again. In the morning, we called on Vice President Hatta and the parliament, and in the afternoon, we laid a wreath at the Heroes Cemetery. Lunch and dinner were with President Sukarno, and those at the dinner table included Vice President Hatta and his wife, Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo and his wife, First Deputy Speaker of the Parliament Arifin and his wife, and others. During the meal, the Suez Canal issue was naturally discussed, and we all believed that President Nasser's courage was partly inspired and supported by the spirit of the Asian-African Conference. We also talked about President Sukarno's visit to the United States, and we believed that his speeches in the United States were something that Asian-African countries should be proud of.

On the 15th, I called on Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo and attended a welcome reception hosted by the Indonesia-China Friendship Association. Professor Brijono, the chairman of the Indonesia-China Friendship Association, who had just recovered from a minor illness, also attended the welcome reception and gave a passionate speech. In addition to the speech, I also had individual contact with the Indonesian friends who attended the meeting. This welcome tea party was always held in a warm and friendly atmosphere.

At noon, I had lunch with Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo and his wife.

In the afternoon, I attended a welcome meeting for all overseas Chinese in Indonesia at the embassy. More than 1,500 representatives of overseas Chinese from all over Indonesia attended the meeting. At the meeting, Mr. Situ Zan, a representative of overseas Chinese, gave a welcome speech. I reported to the overseas Chinese representatives on the rapid progress of the motherland's construction and encouraged them to live in harmony with the Indonesian people. Jakarta Deputy Mayor Danubroto also spoke, saying, "I myself have witnessed that the Chinese people are working hard to build a great industrial country, making it clear to Westerners that we Asian people can also build such a country." The overseas Chinese who attended the meeting were very excited and enthusiastic, and tried everything possible to express their closeness to the people from the motherland. This shows the love of overseas Chinese compatriots for their motherland. After the meeting, we encountered an even more enthusiastic scene. The road outside the embassy was crowded with people, most of whom were overseas Chinese. When we left the embassy to return to the State Palace, the crowded people made it impossible for the car to move.

In the evening, I attended a state banquet held by President Sukarno. This grand welcome banquet was held at the Istana Merdeka, and was attended by important officials of the Indonesian government and diplomatic envoys from the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Vietnam, India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Ceylon, Burma, Egypt, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and other countries. In order to make it easier to understand each other during the banquet, everyone used English. When President Sukarno spoke, he talked about his background and experience. He said that he was very poor in his youth, but he liked to read and met many great thinkers in the world of thought, including Mr. Sun Yat-sen. He said, "Mr. Sun Yat-sen's doctrine inspired me to fight, inspired me to love my country and love my people. As a result of my long-term struggle with my people, I finally won Indonesia's independence in 1945." He also said that the idea of "Asia is one family" was first learned from Mr. Sun Yat-sen. And today, the term "Asia is one family" has become a living reality.

In my speech, in addition to expressing my gratitude to President Sukarno and the Indonesian government and expressing my high respect to the Indonesian people, I also talked about the tremendous changes that have taken place in Asia in the past ten years. Without this change, we would not be able to gather together like this today. I also talked about the direction of our common efforts after Asia and Africa entered a new historical era.

This banquet was conducted in a relaxed and harmonious atmosphere, and everyone felt like a family.

On the morning of the 16th, I visited the Bogor Botanical Gardens. This city, located 54 kilometers from Jakarta, is located at an altitude of 870 meters above sea level and has a fresh landscape and a cool climate. The Bogor Botanical Gardens are one of the largest botanical gardens in the world, cultivating tens of thousands of tropical plants, with more than 20,000 varieties of orchids alone. I saw a very beautiful red flower, but it was also very poisonous, and children would be poisoned and die if they ate it. When I was visiting the botanical gardens, I met many overseas Chinese, including old women and elementary school students. They waited by the roadside, and some followed us. Finally, outside the orchid room, we were surrounded by hundreds of elementary school students, who scrambled to give us the flowers in their hands.

After returning to Jakarta from Bogor, I immediately went to the Foreign Minister's residence to meet with leaders of Indonesian women's groups. Those who attended included the wife of Vice President Hatta, the wife of Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo, the wife of the Air Force Chief of Staff, the wife of the Police Chief, the wife of the Foreign Minister, Mrs. Maria Ulfah Santoso, the chairman of the All-Indonesia Women's Congress, and seven or eighty others. Prior to the meeting, many women representatives had raised many questions to me, most of which were hoping to understand the current situation of women and children in China. For example, do Chinese women have the right to vote and stand for election? Are they protected by the Marriage Law? Is there still polygamy? Have prostitutes really been completely eliminated? Are educational institutions open to women? Is there equal pay for equal work? Are there juvenile courts? Is child labor prohibited? I took the opportunity of this meeting to give a comprehensive answer to these questions, and quoted the saying "seeing is believing" to invite Indonesian women representatives to visit our country. Mrs. Sudiro, the mayor's wife, supported my statement, saying that she indeed did not find prostitutes and beggars in China. The representatives who attended the meeting expressed satisfaction with my answer. Then I gave a speech entitled "Asian-African Women in the Era of Liberation." This gathering was presided over by Mrs. Abdulggani, the wife of Foreign Minister. After the meeting, she hosted a lunch.

In the evening, I was invited to attend a special session of the Indonesian Parliament. Speaker Sadono, who had just returned from a visit to China, delivered a National Day speech, emphasizing that "domestic peace is very necessary for large-scale construction in the future, and it is also very necessary for Indonesia's position in international affairs." Then Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo spoke, explaining that the government will implement planned construction in domestic affairs, and in foreign affairs, it will continue to implement an active, independent, and autonomous policy aimed at guiding world peace and conforming to the spirit of the Bandung Asian-African Conference.

August 17th was an exciting and tense day, and I participated in the celebration of the 11th anniversary of Indonesia's independence all day long. The Indonesian people welcomed this anniversary with joy and excitement. In the past year, the Indonesian people have completed the general election of the parliament and the general election of the Constituent Assembly, abolished the Round Table Conference Agreement, and this year's National Day has a particularly large number of friends from China. In addition to us, the Chinese friends who celebrated the National Day with the Indonesian people also included the China-Indonesia Friendship Delegation headed by Dapu Sheng, the Chinese Agricultural Inspection Team, the Beijing Acrobatic Troupe, and the Chinese Weightlifting Team. According to the people of Jakarta, this formed a climax of Indonesian-Chinese friendship.

This morning, the venue in front of the Independence Palace was solemn and warm. President Sukarno delivered a speech entitled "Enrich Your Lives." When he started his speech, he first called my name. I was very honored to be respected by President Sukarno at the Indonesian National Day ceremony. This was undoubtedly a respect for the 600 million Chinese people. In his speech, President Sukarno lashed out at colonialism. When talking about the Suez Canal issue, he said: "The Suez Canal is not only a problem for Egypt itself, but a problem for all colonial countries and newly independent countries. Asian and African countries must shout 'Take your hands off Egypt!' If I were to decide, I would immediately convene the Second Asian-African Conference to discuss this matter." When he said this, he was met with long applause and cheers.

After the president finished speaking, seventeen young people walked to the steps of the Independence Palace. A young woman in the front row held a box containing state treasures and walked to President Sukarno. The president opened the box, took out the state treasure—the first red and white flag—and handed it to the young woman. Then the seventeen young people raised the national flag on the flagpole in the square in front of the Independence Palace. Then a military parade was held.

At 12:00 noon, we arrived at the Independence Building on North Meridian Mountain Street. In this historically significant house, eleven years ago—in 1945—President Sukarno and Vice President Hatta announced Indonesia's independence. Shortly after we arrived, the president and vice president also arrived. They first laid flowers at the Independence Monument, and then I also laid flowers. With the feeling of representing the Chinese people to pay tribute to the Indonesian people who bravely fought for independence, I placed the flowers on the monument.

At 3:00 PM, I encountered another moving scene. More than 10,000 elementary school students stood in neat rows on the square in front of the Independence Palace. This was a mass choir of 10,000 students held to celebrate the National Day. President Sukarno gave a speech to them, calling on the young men and women who were the hope of the nation to study and work hard for the motherland and turn Indonesia into a prosperous and strong country. When he was speaking, he also introduced me to the elementary school students. He told the elementary school students: "This Chinese woman raised her hand and shouted for independence when she was a child, and then she has been fighting for independence. Now their country has become an independent and powerful country. Learn from her as an example!" He also said, "I call her sister, you should call her aunt, and you should salute her when you meet her on the road." Facing those energetic elementary school students and listening to their loud and melodious singing, I was deeply moved thinking about President Sukarno's concern for the education of the next generation.

In the evening, we also attended the National Day party, which was held outdoors in the backyard of the Independence Palace. A large tropical tree covered the yard, and lights were arranged on the tree. We watched unique Indonesian dances and music in this dreamy and quiet environment. The celebration activities of this day did not end until 12:00 midnight.

In Bandung

On the morning of the 18th, we flew from Jakarta to Bandung. This city, which won the hearts of the people with the Bandung Spirit, welcomed us with flowers and a tidal wave of people. We were hosted by West Java Governor Sanusi and his wife, who accompanied us to visit the school for the deaf and mute, met with more than 300 local overseas Chinese representatives at the Overseas Chinese Middle School, and visited the beautiful city in the drizzle. With reverence, we admired the Independence Building, which served as the venue for the Asian-African Conference. The governor pointed out the seats that the Chinese delegation and Premier Zhou had sat in. This building is not tall or magnificent, but because the Bandung Spirit was born here, it has become a historically significant place that people will always yearn for.

In the evening, I attended a banquet held by Governor Sanusi at the Governor's Office. After dinner, I spent more than ten minutes meeting and talking with forty leaders of Bandung women's groups, followed by an evening party. The evening party included West Java dances and musical and dance programs by overseas Chinese students. The music program was very interesting. It was a bamboo tube ensemble. The Indonesians call this bamboo tube instrument "Angklung." Each person holds a row of bamboo tubes, which is a scale, and everyone cooperates to play a piece of music. The overseas Chinese students played "The East is Red," and they played it very well. I brought back such a set of instruments, which has now been sent to the museum.

We stayed in Bandung for less than a day, but this city, which we visited for the first time, made us feel like we were meeting old friends, and we were not unfamiliar at all. In terms of its scenery, it is very similar to Nishikyo in Japan, except that it does not have the temples of Nishikyo. The people of Bandung—including the overseas Chinese—gave us a kind and warm feeling. We all lived in the homes of overseas Chinese, who gave us the best houses and rooms, making us feel like we were at home.

In Bandung, some overseas Chinese women asked me to greet Chairman Mao on their behalf, and many people also asked me to greet Premier Zhou.

In Yogyakarta

On the 19th, we flew from Bandung to Yogyakarta. Because this city is an ancient cultural city and the revolutionary capital of Indonesia, it is a special region in terms of administrative divisions. The governor of the special region is the Sultan of Yogyakarta, Boowono. This heroic city welcomed us with national flags hanging throughout the city, and overseas Chinese hung both red and white flags and five-star red flags at the same time. According to the original schedule, the deputy governor and other officials of the special region were at the airport to welcome us. But when we got off the plane, the governor of the special region, the Sultan of Yogyakarta, also came to the airport to welcome us. And from then on, he accompanied us throughout the activities. The Sultan of Yogyakarta, Boowono, is an enthusiastic and resolute person who has contributed to the Indonesian national revolutionary movement and has prestige among the local people. He has served as the Minister of Defense of the Republic of Indonesia twice. (During the War of Independence, the Dutch came to meet the Sultan of Yogyakarta, attempting to carry out separatist activities. The Sultan of Yogyakarta wore a military uniform to meet them and said to the Dutch: I am not talking to you as the Sultan, but as a soldier of the Republic of Indonesia. Thus, the imperialists' illusions were shattered.) He is currently committed to the economic construction of the Yogyakarta Special Region.

After I rested for a dozen minutes at the National Building, the Sultan of Yogyakarta accompanied us to see the handicraft exhibition in the back hall of the building. It turned out that they were so polite, in order to enable us to focus on understanding Yogyakarta's handicraft production and to save time, they temporarily exhibited these handicrafts and production performances in the National Building. We saw exhibitions of flower skirts, silverware, leather products, wood carvings, musical instruments, etc. The workers who performed the production were quite skilled. For example, the work of making flower skirts was very delicate and exquisite. Flower skirts are also called sarongs, which are essential clothes for Indonesian women. I saw that when the workers printed flower skirts, the printing plates were inlaid with copper sheets, and the colors were painted with copper strips dipped in resin, which never faded. More exquisite flower skirts take two or three months to print. We saw that those handicrafts with ethnic styles have considerable value in terms of art and practicality. No wonder Yogyakarta's handicrafts are famous throughout Indonesia. In addition to visiting the exhibition, we also visited two flower skirt factories, one of which was larger and was opened by an overseas Chinese. I think Yogyakarta's handicraft production has a good development prospect.

In the afternoon, it was drizzling, and we laid a wreath at the Martyrs' Cemetery, where General Sudirman and many other martyrs who sacrificed their lives for national independence are buried. General Sudirman was a famous Indonesian national hero who served as the commander-in-chief of the Indonesian National Army and was known as the "Father of the National Army." He made many contributions in the War of Independence. Later, he suffered from a serious lung disease, but still commanded the troops to resist the Dutch army while ill. He died of illness in 1950. I was fortunate to pay high tribute in the name of the Chinese people to these Indonesian anti-colonialist heroes who are sleeping underground.

In the afternoon, we met with representatives of overseas Chinese in Yogyakarta and Central Java. I also met with women leaders in Yogyakarta.

In the evening, I attended a banquet held by the Sultan of Yogyakarta at the Geberdian Palace, followed by a Central Java dance. This is a classical court dance, which is the most difficult dance to perform. The movements are very slow, but every joint of the fingers has movements. The performers express their emotions not with expressions but with meditation.

On the morning of the 20th, I took a car to the Borobudur Stupa, which is 40 kilometers from Yogyakarta. The Sultan of Yogyakarta was still with me. The scenery along the way was beautiful. Not far to the north stood a conical peak, with thick smoke rising from the top. The Sultan of Yogyakarta introduced that it was Mount Merapi, the largest volcano in Java. There was an eruption three years ago, and the surrounding 100 kilometers were affected by disasters, killing and injuring several thousand people. Now there are seven institutions monitoring its activities around the volcano. Later, when we returned to Jakarta from Bali, we saw Mount Merapi from the air on the plane, and we could clearly see the crater spewing smoke. This was a rare opportunity.

Halfway through, we passed through the town of Wen Chilan. The Sultan of Yogyakarta suggested going to see the market—the Indonesians call it "Pasar." Inside there were stalls selling vegetables, selling food, selling daily necessities, and many handicrafts. I saw a small oil lamp made from discarded light bulbs. This method of using waste is very interesting and worth learning, so I bought one of these oil lamps. Men and women in the market all sat on the ground, setting up stalls, like some rural temple fairs in our country.

When our convoy of twenty-seven cars arrived at the Borobudur Stupa, it was immediately surrounded by more than a thousand Indonesians and overseas Chinese. This was not the first time we had encountered this situation, because the detailed schedule of our visit activities was published in the newspaper in advance, and people could wait quite accurately in the places we were scheduled to arrive. The Borobudur Stupa is already a thousand years old. This is a historical heritage created by the hardworking and intelligent Indonesian people. The pagoda is square, with a total of nine floors. The walls of the pagoda have countless stone Buddha statues and reliefs, which are indeed valuable works of art.

In the rest pavilion under the pagoda, I received the photo album of the pagoda presented by the Governor of Gitu, the flower skirt presented by the overseas Chinese in Magelang, and a local grass mat and a letter presented by the local women's group. The ending of the letter was "May the friendship between the Indonesian and Chinese people last forever!"

After leaving the Borobudur Stupa, I visited the nearby Mendut Mausoleum. On the way to the airport, I also visited a craft school and a people's elementary school. At 2:00 PM, I bid farewell to this ancient cultural city and heroic city at the airport, and bid farewell to the warm and hospitable hosts, led by the governor of the special region, the Sultan of Yogyakarta, and flew to Bali, the "Island of Poetry."

In Bali

On the afternoon of the 20th, as the plane we were on flew over the Bali Strait and slowly descended, we saw the bays in southern Bali, with endless coconut and pineapple groves on the shore and deep green seawater complementing each other. Our plane landed almost close to the coast. At the airport, we were welcomed by Southeast Governor Sarimin and his wife, local military and political officials, and representatives of overseas Chinese. We were invited to the Bali Hotel in Batang City, where we attended a welcome dinner hosted by the governor that day.

The people of Bali have a glorious history of resisting colonialists. The Netherlands ruled Indonesia for more than three hundred and fifty years, but it has only completely occupied Bali for seventy years. The people of Bali fought the last battle against the Netherlands in Batang. The Balinese prince refused to surrender. As a result, the prince and all the men and women in the palace were killed in battle, and the Dutch burned down the palace. The Bali Hotel where we stayed was built on the old site of the palace.

On the morning of the 21st, we went to the Balinese countryside to visit. We visited silver shops, wood carving products, and Balinese painting exhibitions in several places. I admire the artistic talent and hard work of the Balinese people. They have preserved the traditional art of the Balinese people. However, due to the results of colonial rule, these works of art were not valued in the past, and the lives of these art workers were also very difficult. I believe that in the future, with the help of the local government, these works of art and handicrafts with traditional ethnic styles will play an important role in exchanging culture and promoting economic prosperity.

In Bali, what attracts us more than the beautiful scenery is the women of Bali, who bear more labor than men. They are very similar to the Hakka women before liberation. All along the way, we saw groups of women carrying things on their heads. Whether they were old women or little girls, they all participated in labor. However, their bodies are very healthy, their backs are straight, and their chests are prominent. I think this is the result of labor. Although for various reasons, their lives are still quite difficult today, their optimistic attitude and beautiful appearance produce an attractive force.

I visited the Belgian painter Le Mayeur, who has lived in Bali for 24 years. He is one of the world's famous painters, and we visited his studio. We also had a local-flavored lunch at the Zokorte Agung's Palace and watched a cockfight. His palace is very similar to Chinese architecture. In the evening, I watched the world-famous Balinese dance. If the characteristic of Yogyakarta's dance is delicate movements and emphasis on meditation, then the characteristic of Balinese dance is significant movements and rich expressions. The Balinese dance troupe has already come to China for a visit and performance, and will surely be welcomed by the Chinese people.

In Bali, we also met with local and neighboring overseas Chinese representatives and students from overseas Chinese schools. On Bali, we found more historical facts about cultural exchanges between China and Indonesia than elsewhere. Copper coins that are no longer easy to see in our country can be found in every household on Bali. It was not long ago that these copper coins were stopped from circulation. Now people tie copper coins into strings and hang them up as indispensable artifacts in religious ceremonies. In a silverware shop, we found strings of copper coins with the Kaiyuan reign title, the Wanli reign title, and various reign titles of the Qing Dynasty, which shows the close cultural relationship between China and Indonesia in history.

It is no exaggeration to call Bali the "Island of Poetry." This beautiful poem describes this beautiful tropical island and its brave and wise people, describes the ancient cultural traditions, describes the difficult but optimistic lives of the people, and also describes the unlimited future of this island.

Saying Goodbye to Indonesia

On the morning of the 22nd, I left Bali by plane. It was originally planned to land in Surabaya midway and meet with local representatives at the airport. But due to time constraints, this plan was temporarily cancelled and I flew directly to Jakarta.

Back in Jakarta, I lived in our embassy. This afternoon was the last moment we stayed in Indonesia, so it was particularly busy. First, I made a radio speech at the Indonesian Republic Radio entitled "The Bandung Spirit and the Unity between the Asian and African Peoples." Then I went to visit President Sukarno's wife, and we had a cordial conversation. From there, I rushed to the stadium to participate in the Jakarta citizens' welcome rally. Those who attended included Mayor Sudiro, Speaker Sadono, other military and political officials, heads of various political parties and people's organizations in Jakarta, social celebrities, and representatives of overseas Chinese, with more than 1,000 people. There were more crowds outside the venue. Mayor Sudiro first gave a welcome speech, and then I gave a speech of nearly an hour, entitled "The Growing Friendship between China and Indonesia."

When I returned to the embassy at 8:30 PM that evening, the guests for the reception held by Ambassador Huang for my visit to Indonesia had already arrived. They included Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo and his wife, Deputy Prime Minister Longm, Speaker Sadono, Mayor Sudiro, government officials, party leaders, social celebrities, diplomatic envoys, representatives of overseas Chinese, and more than 500 people.

On the morning of the 23rd, I went to the Independence Palace to bid farewell to President Sukarno. He said that he would arrive in Beijing at the end of September and would have the opportunity to participate in China's National Day.

Along the way to the airport, there were unscheduled crowds of people saying goodbye. Inside the airport, there was still a crowd of people saying goodbye, led by the Prime Minister. I delivered a farewell speech and shook hands with Indonesian friends to say goodbye. At 9:00 AM, the plane left the runway. With a feeling of reluctance, I left Jakarta and left Indonesia.

The ten-day visit passed quickly, but many unforgettable impressions will remain in my memory for a long time. I visited our southern neighbor, and their road of struggle and even their lives and emotions have many things in common with us. This country, which has only recently gained independence through its own struggle, is engaging in construction with increasingly united forces. They currently have difficulties, but the Indonesian people, with a strong sense of self-esteem, will surely overcome these difficulties. I also saw that they are constantly making contributions to world peace.

Our visit has played a certain role in further mutual understanding and enhancing friendship between the Chinese and Indonesian people. The editorial of the Indonesian Republic Daily said that my arrival is beneficial to the cause of strengthening the friendship between the people of Indonesia and China, and the friendship between these two great nations of Asia is increasingly consolidated.

I realized that friendly visits between nations and countries that treat each other equally are one of the important means to strengthen mutual assistance and cooperation and promote world peace. Especially between the current Asian and African countries, this kind of activity is even more meaningful. Therefore, I think we should carry out more of these mutual friendly visits.

Finally, let me take this opportunity to express my gratitude to President Sukarno, the Indonesian government, and the Indonesian people for their warm and sincere hospitality. I would also like to thank the overseas Chinese compatriots in Indonesia for their warm welcome and help.

    访问印度尼西亚的报告
    （一九五六年九月二十六日在全国人民代表大会常务委员会第四十七次会议上的报告）
    全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长　宋庆龄
    我应苏加诺总统和印度尼西亚政府的邀请去访问印度尼西亚的行程，本来安排在七月间。但因我病在昆明耽搁了一些日子，直到八月十三日下午才从仰光乘飞机前往印度尼西亚，十四日上午一时到达雅加达，二十三日启程回国。
    在十天的日程中，我们访问了印度尼西亚的首都雅加达，以亚非会议闻名于世的万隆，文化古都和革命的英雄城市日惹，还有被称作“诗之岛”的峇厘。我们应邀参加了印度尼西亚独立十一周年庆祝大会，出席了国会特别会议和雅加达市民欢迎大会。我们得到机会和印度尼西亚的政治家们，各界著名人士和妇女领袖们进行了友好的接触，还接见了各地的华侨代表。
    这次访问给我留下了愉快而深刻的印象。在我们这个友好的邻邦中我们受到了热烈的欢迎。我们看到了印度尼西亚的美丽富饶的自然环境，也看到了印度尼西亚人民在建设自己国家的工作中的决心和力量。还看到了印度尼西亚和中国两国人民之间日益增长的友谊。我们为着有机会向我们的邻邦——印度尼西亚的人民表达中国人民的心意而感到荣幸，也为着能够把我们在印度尼西亚获得的印象和印度尼西亚人民的友谊传达给中国人民而感到愉快。这种感情使我更深切地认识到这次难忘的访问和中国印度尼西亚人民之间的友谊的巨大的价值。
    在雅加达
    八月十四早晨一点钟，当我们乘的飞机在雅加达机场降落的时候，在探照灯的强烈光线下，受到了以沙斯特罗阿米佐约总理和夫人为首的印度尼西亚政府领导人和各界著名人士，外交使节，华侨代表的欢迎。而在机场外面更有上万的群众把马路挤得几乎通不过汽车去。群众中有印度尼西亚人，也有华侨，听说很多人从下午九时就站在街上直等到早晨一时。我深深地为他们的热情所感动。
    一时三十分，我们到了总统府独立宫的大厅里，受到了苏加诺总统和哈达副总统和夫人的热诚而亲切的欢迎。苏加诺总统见了面第一句话就说：“你到底来啦！”早晨二时，我被招待在国家宫休息，实际上在这一连串令人兴奋的场面下，是很难安心休息的。天亮后不久，我们就又开始活动了。上午拜会了哈达副总统和国会，下午到烈士公墓献花圈。午饭和晚饭都是和苏加诺总统一起吃的，晚饭同席的还有哈达副总统和夫人，沙斯特罗阿米佐约总理和夫人，国会第一副议长阿利芬和夫人等人。席间很自然地谈到苏伊士运河问题，我们都认为纳赛尔总统的勇气一部分是受了亚非会议的精神的鼓舞和支持。我们也谈到了苏加诺总统访问美国的事情，我们认为他在美国的演说是值得亚非国家骄傲的。
    十五日拜会了沙斯特罗阿米佐约总理，参加了印度尼西亚中国友好协会的欢迎会，印度尼西亚中国友好协会的主席布里约诺教授小病初愈，也出席了欢迎会，并作了热情洋溢的演说，我除了演说之外，还和到会的印度尼西亚朋友们进行了个别的接触。这个欢迎茶会始终在热情友好的气氛中进行。
    中午和沙斯特罗阿米佐约总理和夫人共进午餐。
    下午，在大使馆参加了全印度尼西亚华侨的欢迎会。到会的有印度尼西亚各地派来的华侨代表一千五百多人。会上由华侨代表司徒赞先生致欢迎辞，我对华侨代表报告了祖国建设事业的突飞猛进，并勉励华侨要和印度尼西亚人民友好相处。雅加达副市长达努布洛多也讲了话，他说“我自己曾亲眼看见，中国人民正在努力建设一个伟大的工业国家，使西方人明了，我们亚洲人民也会建造这样的国家”。到会的华侨都非常兴奋、热情，对从祖国来的人想尽一切方法来表示亲近。这说明华侨同胞对祖国的热爱。而散会后我们就遇到了更加热烈的场面，大使馆门外马路上挤满了人群，绝大部分是华侨，当我们离开大使馆回国家宫的时候，拥挤的人群使汽车无法开动。
    晚上参加了苏加诺总统举行的国宴。这个盛大的欢迎宴会在独立宫举行，参加宴会的有印度尼西亚政府的重要官员和苏联、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、南斯拉夫、越南、印度、巴基斯坦、阿富汗、锡兰、缅甸、埃及、伊拉克、沙特阿拉伯等国的外交使节，为了使在宴会中彼此谈话更容易了解，大家都使用了英语。苏加诺总统讲话的时候谈到了他的身世和经历，他说他在少年时期非常贫苦，但却喜欢读书，在思想的世界里遇见了许多伟大的思想家，其中也包括孙中山先生。他说“孙中山先生的学说启发我去斗争，启发我去爱我的国家，爱我的人民。我同我的人民一道长期斗争的结果，终于在一九四五年争取到了印度尼西亚的独立。”他又说“亚洲是一家”的思想，第一次是从孙中山先生那里知道的。而今天，“亚洲是一家”这个名词已经变成活生生的现实了。
    我在讲话时除了向苏加诺总统和印度尼西亚政府表示感谢，向印度尼西亚人民表示崇高的敬意之外，还谈到近十年来亚洲所发生的巨大的变化，若不是这种变化，我们就不可能像今天这样欢聚一堂。我也谈到亚非两洲进入新的历史纪元之后，我们共同努力的方向。
    这个宴会在轻松融洽的气氛中进行，大家感到是一家人。
    十六日上午游览了茂物的植物园。这个距雅加达五十四公里的城市位置在拔海八百七十公尺的高地上，风景清新，气候凉爽。茂物的植物园是世界上最大的植物园之一，培植好几万种热带植物，单单兰花就有二万多种。我看到有一种非常好看的红花，但也非常毒，小孩子吃了就中毒而死。当我在植物园游览时，遇到很多华侨，有老太太，也有小学生，他们守候在路旁，也有跟着跑的，最后在兰室外面，被好几百个小学生包围住了，他们争先恐后地要把手中的鲜花送给我们。
    从茂物回到雅加达，马上就到外交部长官邸去和印度尼西亚妇女团体领袖会见，到会的有哈达副总统夫人，沙斯特罗阿米佐约总理夫人，空军参谋长夫人，警察总长夫人，外交部长夫人，全印度尼西亚妇女大会主席玛丽亚·乌伐·山多梭夫人等七、八十人。事先曾有不少妇女代表向我提出了许多问题，其中大部分是希望了解目前中国妇女儿童的情况。如中国妇女是否有选举权与被选举权？是否受婚姻法的保护？还有多妻制吗？妓女是否真的完全消灭？教育机构是否对妇女开放？是否同工同酬？有没有儿童法庭？是否禁止童工等。我就借这次会见的机会对这些问题作了综合的答复，并且引用了“百闻不如一见”的话顺便邀请印度尼西亚的妇女代表来我国访问。苏迪罗市长夫人支持我的说法，她说她在中国的确没有发现妓女和乞丐。到会的代表们对我的答复表示满意。接着我作了以“在解放时代里的亚非妇女”为题的讲话。这次聚会是由外交部长阿卜杜加尼的夫人主持的，会后她又作了午餐的主人。
    晚上应邀出席了印度尼西亚国会特别会议。刚刚访问中国归来的沙多诺议长发表了国庆演说，他强调说明“国内和平对于来日大规模建设是很需要的，对于印度尼西亚在国际事务中的地位也是很需要的。”接着沙斯特罗阿米佐约总理演说，他说明政府在内政方面将实行有计划的建设，在外交方面，仍将执行以导向世界和平为目的，符合万隆亚非会议精神的积极的独立自主政策。
    八月十七日是个又兴奋、又紧张的日子，整天都参加了印度尼西亚独立十一周年纪念日的庆祝活动。印度尼西亚人民以欢欣鼓舞的心情迎接这个纪念日。在过去一年中，印度尼西亚人民完成了国会的大选和制宪会议的大选，废除了圆桌会议协定，同时今年的国庆有特别多的来自中国的朋友。和印度尼西亚人民一道欢度国庆的中国朋友，除了我们之外，还有以达浦生为首的中国印度尼西亚友好访问团，中国农业考察团，北京杂技团和中国举重代表队。按雅加达人们的说法：这形成了印度尼西亚、中国友好的高潮。
    这一天早晨，独立宫前的会场又庄严又热烈。苏加诺总统作了以“充实你们的生活”为题的演说。他开始演说时，首先称呼了我的名字，我很荣幸，在印度尼西亚国庆大典上受到苏加诺总统这样尊敬，这无疑地是对六亿中国人民的尊敬。苏加诺总统的演说中痛斥了殖民主义，在谈到苏伊士运河问题时他说：“苏伊士运河不仅是埃及本身的问题，而是所有殖民地国家和刚宣告独立的国家的问题。亚非国家必须高呼‘把手从埃及放开！’如果让我决定，我将立即召集第二次亚非会议来讨论这事。”当他讲到这里时，下面报以长时间的鼓掌和欢呼。
    总统讲完后，有十七个青年走到独立宫的台阶前面，前排的一个女青年把盛国宝的盒子捧着走到苏加诺总统面前，总统打开盒子，取出国宝——第一面红白旗，又交给女青年，再由这十七个青年把这面国旗升在独立宫前广场中的旗杆上。接着举行了阅兵式。
    中午十二时，我们到了北径山东街的独立大厦，在这个具有历史意义的房子里，十一年前——一九四五年，苏加诺总统和哈达副总统宣布了印度尼西亚的独立。我们到后不久，总统和副总统也到了，他们先向独立纪念碑献花，接着我也献了花，我以代表中国人民向为争取独立而英勇斗争的印度尼西亚人民致敬的心情把鲜花放在纪念碑上。
    下午三时，我又遇到一个动人的场面，一万多个小学生排着整齐的队伍站在独立宫前的广场上，这是为庆祝国庆节举行的万名学生大合唱。苏加诺总统对他们训话，他号召作为民族希望的少年男女，要为祖国勤奋学习和工作，把印度尼西亚变成繁荣富强的国家。他在训话时，也把我介绍给小学生们，他告诉小学生们说：“这位中国妇女从小时候就举手喊独立，后来一直为独立而奋斗，现在她们的国家已经变成独立的强大的国家了，以她为榜样学习吧！”他又说“我称她作姐姐，你们应该把她叫姑母，在路上遇见了要行礼。”我面对那些精神饱满的小学生们，听着他们那响亮悦耳的歌声，想着苏加诺总统这样关心对下一代的教育，使我深受感动。
    晚上我们又参加了国庆晚会，晚会是在独立宫的后院里露天举行的，一棵热带特有的大树把院子遮盖起来，树上布置灯光，我们就在这个富于幻想的幽静的环境里看了具有独特风格的印度尼西亚舞蹈和音乐。直到深夜十二时才结束了这一天的庆祝活动。
    在万隆
    十八日上午，我们由雅加达乘飞机到达万隆，这个以万隆精神赢得人心的城市用鲜花和潮水般的群众欢迎了我们。我们受到西爪哇省长萨努西和夫人的招待，陪着我们参观了聋哑学校，在华侨中学和当地的华侨代表三百多人见面，在细雨中游览了美丽多姿的市容。我们怀着崇敬的心情瞻仰了作过亚非会议会场的独立大厦，省长把中国代表团和周总理坐过的位子指给我们看。这个建筑并不高大，也不算华丽，但因为在这里诞生了万隆精神，便成了具有历史意义的永远令人向往的地方了。
    晚上参加了萨努西省长在省长公署举行的宴会，吃完饭后用了十几分钟时间和万隆妇女团体的领袖们四十人见面谈话，接着就是晚会。晚会中有西爪哇舞蹈，也有华侨学生的音乐舞蹈节目。音乐节目很有趣，是竹管合奏，这种竹管乐器印度尼西亚人叫它“安格隆”，每个人拿一排竹管，是一个音阶，大家合作奏出一个乐曲来，华侨学生演奏了“东方红”，他们奏得很好听。我带了这样一套乐器回来，现已送到博物馆了。
    我们在万隆停留的时间还不到一天，但这个初次访问的城市却使我们感到像是会晤老朋友，一点也不生疏。就它的风景说，很像日本的西京，只是没有西京那些庙宇。万隆的人们——包括华侨也给了我们亲切而温暖的感觉。我们都分别住在华侨家里，他们把最好的房子和房间让给我们，使我们觉得像在家里一样。
    在万隆，有些华侨妇女要我代她们问候毛主席，也有许多人托我问候周总理。
    在日惹
    十九日，我们从万隆乘飞机到了日惹。由于这个城市是印度尼西亚的文化古城，又是革命首都，所以在行政区划上作为特区。特区长官是日惹苏丹波乌诺。这个英雄城市用全市悬挂国旗来欢迎我们，华侨则把红白旗和五星红旗同时挂出来。在原来的日程上，到飞机场欢迎的有特区副长官和其他官员。但是当我们下飞机时，特区长官日惹苏丹也到机场来欢迎了。而且以后他一直陪着我们进行活动。日惹苏丹波乌诺是一个热情而刚毅的人，在印度尼西亚民族革命运动中有过贡献，在当地人民中有威信。他曾两次任印度尼西亚共和国国防部长。（在独立战争时期，荷兰人来会见日惹苏丹，企图进行分裂活动，日惹苏丹穿军服出见，对荷兰人说：我不是以苏丹的身份和你谈话，而是以印度尼西亚共和国军人的身份和你谈话。于是帝国主义者的幻想被打碎了。）目前他正致力于日惹特区的经济建设。
    我到国家大厦休息了十几分钟，日惹苏丹就陪着我们到大厦后厅看工艺品展览，原来他们这样客气，为了使我们能够集中地了解日惹的手工艺生产，也为了节省时间，他们把这些手工艺品和制作表演临时展览在国家大厦里。我们看见展览的有花裙布、银器、皮制品、木雕、乐器等，进行制作表演的工人技艺相当高，如制花裙的工作就非常细致精巧，花裙也叫沙龙，是印度尼西亚妇女们必穿的衣服。我看工人们印制花裙布时，印花板是用铜片嵌起来的，颜色是用铜条醮着树脂画上去的，永不退色，比较讲究的花裙布要费两三个月才能印制出一条来。我们看到那些富有民族风格的工艺品不论在艺术方面或实用方面都有相当高的价值，无怪日惹的工艺品驰名于全印度尼西亚了。除了参观展览之外，我们还去参观了两个花裙厂，其中一个较大的是华侨开的。我觉得日惹的工艺生产有很好的发展前途。
    下午落着细雨，我们到烈士墓献了花圈，那里长眠着苏第曼将军和其他许多为争取国家独立而牺牲的烈士们。苏第曼将军是著名的印度尼西亚民族英雄，曾任印度尼西亚国民军总司令，被称为“国民军之父”，在独立战争中立过很多功勋，后来患了严重的肺病，仍带病指挥部队反抗荷兰军队。一九五○年因病逝世。我有幸以中国人民的名义向这些长眠地下的印度尼西亚反殖民主义的英雄们致以崇高的敬意。
    下午我们会见了日惹和中爪哇地区的华侨代表，我还会见了日惹的妇女领袖们。
    晚上参加了日惹苏丹在格巴帝安宫举行的宴会，接着看了中爪哇舞蹈。这是一种古典的宫廷舞蹈，是一种最难跳的舞蹈，动作很慢，可是连手指的每个关节都有动作。表演者不是用表情而是用默想来表达情绪。
    二十日上午乘汽车到距日惹四十公里的波罗浮屠佛塔，日惹苏丹仍作陪。沿途风景优美，北面不远耸立着一座圆锥形的山峰，山顶冒着浓烟，日惹苏丹介绍那是爪哇最大的莫拉比火山，三年前曾有过一次爆发，附近一百公里之内都受到灾害，死伤了好几千人。现在有七个机构在火山周围监视着它的活动。后来我们从峇厘回雅加达时，又在飞机上从空中看到莫拉比火山，很清楚地看见正在喷着烟雾的火山口，这是难得的机会。
    半路经过文池兰镇，日惹苏丹提议去看市场——印度尼西亚人叫“巴刹”。里面有卖蔬菜的，卖粮食的，卖日用品的，很多的手工业品。我看到一种小油灯，是用作废的电灯泡制成的，这种利用废物方法很有趣，值得学习，因此我买了一只这样的油灯。市场里男男女女都坐在地上，把东西摆成地摊，好像我国有些乡间的庙会似的。
    当我们的车队的二十七辆汽车到达波罗浮屠佛塔时，立刻被一千多印度尼西亚人和华侨包围了。我们已经不是第一次遇到这种情况了，因为我们访问活动的详细日程事先就在报纸上公布了，人们可以相当准确地在我们预定要到达的地方等待着。波罗浮屠佛塔已有一千年的历史了，这是勤劳智慧的印度尼西亚人民创造的历史遗产。佛塔是方形的，共九层，塔壁上有数不清的石雕佛像和浮雕，的确是件宝贵的艺术品。
    在佛塔下面的休息亭里，我接受了吉突州长赠的佛塔照像册，马吉朗华侨赠的花裙布，还有当地妇女团体赠的一张本地出产的草席和一封信，信的结束语是“愿印度尼西亚中国人民的友谊长存”！
    离开波罗浮屠佛塔后，又到附近参观了门突陵庙。在往飞机场的途中还参观了一所工艺学校和民众小学。下午二时，我在飞机场上辞别了这个文化古城和英雄的城市，辞别了以特区长官、日惹苏丹为首的热情而好客的主人们，飞向“诗之岛”峇厘。
    在峇厘
    二十日下午，当我们乘的飞机飞过峇厘海峡慢慢降低高度时，就看到峇厘南部的一带海湾，岸上无边的椰子和菠萝树林和深绿色的海水互相陪衬着。我们的飞机几乎是紧贴着海岸着陆的。在机场受到了东南省长沙里民和夫人，当地军政官员和华侨代表的欢迎。我们被招待在峇塘市的峇厘旅馆里，当天就在这里参加了省长举行的欢迎晚宴。
    峇厘人民有过反抗殖民者的光荣历史。荷兰统治印度尼西亚有三百五十多年的历史，但完全占领峇厘却只有七十年。峇厘人民在峇塘进行过反抗荷兰的最后一战，峇厘王子拒绝投降。结果王子和宫廷中的男女全部战死，荷兰人焚毁了王宫。我们住的峇厘旅馆就建筑在王宫的旧址上。
    二十一日上午，我们到峇厘乡下去游览。在几个地方分别参观了银器店，木刻制品和峇厘绘画展览。我很佩服峇厘人的艺术才能和艰苦的劳动，他们保存了峇厘人民的传统艺术。但是由于殖民统治的结果，过去这些艺术品是不被重视的，这些艺术工人们的生活也很困苦，我相信今后在当地政府的帮助下，这些具有传统民族风格的艺术品和工艺品会在交流文化和繁荣经济方面起重要作用。
    在峇厘，比美丽的风景更吸引我们注意的是峇厘的妇女，她们比男子担负了更多的劳动。她们和解放前的客家女子很相似。沿途都看到成群结队的头上顶着东西的妇女，不论老太太或小姑娘都参加劳动。可是她们的身体都非常健康，腰背挺直，胸部突出，我想这是劳动的结果。虽然因为各种原因，她们今天的生活还相当困苦，但是她们的乐观的态度和美丽的容貌却产生一种引人的力量。
    我曾访问了居住峇厘已经二十四年的比利时画家勒迈耶尔，他是世界著名的画家之一，我们参观了他的画室。还在佐哥尔特·阿共的王府里吃了一顿本地风味的午餐，并看了一场斗鸡。他的王府很像中国的建筑。晚上看了闻名于世界的峇厘舞蹈，如果说日惹的舞蹈的特点是动作细腻，偏重默想，那么峇厘舞蹈的特点就是动作显著，富于表情。峇厘舞蹈团已到中国作访问演出了，一定会受到中国人民的欢迎。
    在峇厘，我们还会见了当地和临近各埠的华侨代表和华侨学校的学生们。在峇厘岛上我们发现比别处较多的中国、印度尼西亚历史上文化交流事实。我们国内已不易看到的铜钱，在峇厘岛上家家都能找到，这种铜钱被停止流通还是不久的事情。现在人们把铜钱结成一串一串的吊起来，当做宗教仪式上不可缺少的神器。在一家银器店里我们发现一串串的铜钱中有开元年号的，有万历年号的，也有清朝各种年号的，可见中国、印度尼西亚历史上文化关系的密切。
    峇厘被称为“诗之岛”一点也不夸张，这首优美的诗篇里描写了这个热带的美丽海岛和它的勇敢智慧的人民，描写了古老的文化传统，描写了人民的困苦的然而是乐观的生活，也描写了这个岛屿的不可限量的未来。
    向印度尼西亚告别
    二十二日早晨乘飞机离开峇厘，原打算中途在泗水降落，并和当地的代表人士在机场见面。但因为时间关系，临时取消了这个计划，直飞雅加达了。
    回到雅加达住在我国大使馆里。这天下午是我们留在印度尼西亚的最后时刻，因此也格外忙碌。首先我在印度尼西亚共和国电台作了以“万隆精神和亚非人民之间的团结”为题的广播演说。接着去拜会苏加诺总统夫人，我们作了亲切的谈话。从那里赶到体育馆参加雅加达市民欢迎大会。到会的有苏迪罗市长、沙多诺议长等军政官员、雅加达市各政党各人民团体负责人、社会名流和华侨代表等一千多人。会场外面则有更多的群众。苏迪罗市长先致欢迎词，接着我作了将近一小时的演说，题目是“中国、印度尼西亚之间日益增长的友谊。”
    当晚上八时半回到大使馆时，黄大使为了我的访问印度尼西亚而举行的招待会的客人早就到齐了。其中包括沙斯特罗阿米佐约总理和夫人、隆姆副总理、沙多诺议长、苏迪罗市长和政府官员、政党领袖、社会名流、外交使节、华侨代表等五百多人。
    二十三日清晨到独立宫向苏加诺总统辞行，他说九月底他将到达北京，将有机会参加中国的国庆。
    在到机场的沿途都有不约而来的欢送的群众，在机场里面仍是以总理为首的欢送的人群。我发表了告别演说，和印度尼西亚的朋友们握手告别，九时正，飞机离开了跑道。我怀着惜别的心情离开了雅加达，离开了印度尼西亚。
    为时十天的访问很快就过去了，但许多难忘的印象却将长久留在我的记忆中。我访问了我们这个南方的邻邦，他们的斗争的道路以至他们的生活和情感有很多和我们相同的地方。这个不久之前才用自己的斗争获得独立的国家，正在用日益团结的力量从事建设，他们目前有困难，但是怀着强烈的自尊心的印度尼西亚人民一定能克服这些困难。我还看到他们正在不断地对世界和平作出贡献来。
    我们的访问在使中国和印度尼西亚人民之间进一步互相了解和增进友谊方面起了一定的作用。印度尼西亚共和国日报的社论曾说我的到来对密切印度尼西亚、中国两国人民友谊的事业有好处，亚洲这两个伟大民族的友谊日益巩固了。
    我体会到：在平等相待的民族和国家之间的友好访问，是加强互助合作和促进世界和平的重要手段之一，特别在目前的亚非国家之间，这种活动更具有意义。因此，我觉得我们应该多多进行这种相互之间的友好访问。
    最后，让我在这里对苏加诺总统、印度尼西亚政府和印度尼西亚人民给我的热情而诚恳的款待表示感谢。对在印度尼西亚的华侨同胞们给我的热烈欢迎和帮助表示感谢。
