The "Rural Work Bulletin" Organizes Reader Discussion

Beijing, September 2nd. (By telephone from this newspaper)

    The "Rural Work Bulletin" published a special column in its fourth issue entitled "Discussion on the Size of Agricultural Cooperatives." This column contains twelve representative opinions. Readers have expressed their views on the size of cooperatives based on their local conditions:
    The size of cooperatives should not be uniform due to different geographical conditions in plains, mountainous areas, and hilly areas. In plains, where the population is concentrated and transportation is convenient, it is believed that cooperatives can be larger. In the Hebei Plain, where villages are large, comrades believe that one cooperative per village is more appropriate. Comrades in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang plains believe that a cooperative of about 300 to 500 households is more appropriate. This size of cooperative generally has two to three thousand mu of land, which is equal to half or no more than a small township. The main characteristic of mountainous areas is dispersed residence and inconvenient transportation, so the size of the cooperative should be smaller to facilitate production. Comrades in the mountainous areas of Hunan believe that a cooperative composed of one or two or two or three natural villages, that is, about seventy or eighty to one hundred households, is more appropriate. Some comrades believe that hilly areas have their own characteristics. For example, in the southern hilly areas, water conservancy is very developed and forms an irrigation system. It is also very important to consider the size of the cooperative based on the irrigation system. Generally, one or two hundred households share a reservoir or pond. It is more appropriate to plan them as one cooperative. In areas with many ethnic minorities, the size of the cooperative should not be too large, generally several dozen households are appropriate. If it is too large, it will not be easy to take care of the characteristics of the ethnic groups and meet the requirements of the various ethnic groups.
    The discussion unanimously agreed that, under normal circumstances, the larger the scale of the agricultural cooperative, the more it can show its superiority. For example: more land is connected into large areas, which is convenient for planting according to local conditions and also for machine cultivation; a large cooperative with a large population is convenient for division of labor and specialization, rational allocation of labor, and can also carry out large-scale agricultural capital construction. However, being large must have large conditions, such as a strong grassroots party organization, strong resident cadres, a certain foundation for running a cooperative, and convenient natural conditions. If these conditions are not met, blindly pursuing bigness will lead to overlapping institutions, chaotic work, and cadres being divorced from reality. Generally, a large cooperative should not exceed the scope of a township, because within a township, personnel are familiar, cadres understand each other, key personnel, land, manpower, financial resources, and technical talents are very concentrated, and things are easy to handle. More importantly, the party branch is easy to lead. If it exceeds a township, it is very inconvenient to lead. However, there are also many disadvantages to having one cooperative per township, such as the cooperative being difficult to control, the problems after merging the cooperatives being complicated and difficult to handle, especially the easy formation of separation of the cooperative and the government, and the inability to give play to the organizational roles of the township and the cooperative. Therefore, participants in the discussion unanimously agreed that the size of the cooperative should be determined based on the principles of being conducive to production, easy to lead, and adapting to local conditions. Under the current circumstances, it should not be too large in general.
    The main readers of the "Rural Work Bulletin" are district and township cadres, and the main content is to introduce the experience of agricultural production cooperatives in various places. This publication has been published for four issues since its inception on May 20. This issue contains a discussion on the size of the cooperative, and will continue to publish discussions on the organization of production teams in the future.

### 社的规模多大为好  “农村工作通讯”组织读者讨论

    社的规模多大为好
    “农村工作通讯”组织读者讨论
    本报讯　“农村工作通讯”第四期发表了“关于农业社规模大小问题的讨论”的专栏，在这个专栏里刊载了有代表性的意见十二篇。读者都根据当地具体情况提出对社的规模的看法：
    平原、山区和丘陵地带，由于地理条件不同，社的规模大小不能强求一致。平原地区人口集中，交通方便，认为社的规模可以大些。河北平原村庄较大，这里的同志认为一村一社比较合适。江苏、浙江平原地区的同志认为三百户到五百户左右一个社比较合适，这样规模的社一般有两三千亩土地，等于半个或不超过一个小乡的范围。山区的主要特点是居住分散，交通不便，社的规模要小一些，才能有利于生产。湖南山区的同志认为，一两个或两三个自然村，即七、八十户到一百户左右组成一个社比较合适。有的同志认为：丘陵地区有丘陵地区的特点，例如南方丘陵地区水利很发达，而且形成灌溉系统，根据灌溉系统来考虑社的大小也很重要。那里一般都是一百几十户到二百户左右人家共同使用一个水库或塘坝，把他们规划为一个社比较适宜。在多民族地区，社的规模也不能太大，一般以几十户为宜。太大了就不容易照顾民族特点、适合各民族的要求。
    讨论中一致认为，在一般情况下，农业社的规模愈大愈能显示出优越性。例如：更多的土地连成大片，便于因地种植，也便于机器耕种；社大人多便于分工分业，合理调配劳动力，也能够进行较大规模的农业基本建设。但大必须要有大的条件，如较强的党的基层组织，坚强的驻社干部，一定的办社基础，便利的自然条件等。如果不具备这些条件，一味贪大，便会产生机构重叠、工作混乱、干部脱离实际的偏向。一般的大社以不超过一个乡的范围为最好，因为在一个乡之内，人事熟悉，干部互相了解，骨干、土地、人力、财力、技术人材等都很集中，事情好办。更重要的是党支部便于领导。如果超过一个乡，领导起来就很不方便。但一乡一社的坏处也不少，如社大不易掌握，并社后问题复杂不易处理，特别是容易形成社、政不分，不能发挥乡、社各自的组织作用。因此，参加讨论的人一致认为：社的规模大小，应该根据有利生产、便于领导和因地制宜的原则来确定。在目前情况下，一般不宜太大。
    “农村工作通讯”的主要读者对象是区乡干部，主要内容是介绍各地办农业生产合作社的经验。这个刊物自5月20日创刊到现在已出了四期。这一期上刊载了关于社的规模的讨论意见，以后还将继续刊载关于生产队的组织的讨论。
