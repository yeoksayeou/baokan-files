Dear Comrades!

    Please allow me to first express my personal joy at having the opportunity to visit your beautiful country once again. During my previous visit, I had already sincerely and wholeheartedly fallen in love with it, and a deep admiration for the construction achievements of the great Chinese people has already linked me with your wonderful country.

    It is a great honor for me to lead our Party's delegation to attend the Eighth National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, the vanguard of the Chinese people and the organizer of all their achievements.

    Our Czechoslovak Communist Party delegation has traveled with joy through the socialist homeland of the Soviet Union to the beautiful capital of Beijing in the People's Republic of China, to participate in this glorious congress, fulfill our noble mission, and convey to you the greetings of our Party Central Committee.

    Dear Comrades! The Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, on behalf of the entire Party and all the Czechoslovak people, extends sincere and comradely congratulations to the Eighth National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party.

    Our people have always regarded the Chinese Communist Party as the brave leader of the Chinese people, who have waged heroic struggles against imperialist oppression and exploitation, striving for the freedom of the Chinese people and a happy life for the Chinese working people. This epic of the people's liberation struggle culminated in the glorious victory of the Chinese people, which became a tremendous stimulus and pillar for the people of Asia and Africa struggling to break free from colonial oppression.

    The socialist construction of the People's Republic of China, its international status and influence, signifies a further victory for Marxism-Leninism, points the way for the liberation movements of colonial and dependent countries, and supports their just struggle for national independence.

    Our people follow with great interest the historically significant progress of the Chinese people, sincerely rejoice in the achievements of China's socialist construction, and regard these achievements as a guarantee for the continued vigorous development of the forces of peace, democracy, and progress. The friendly relations between the Chinese and Czechoslovak peoples have fully and comprehensively developed in a direction that benefits both our countries. This friendship is unbreakable, because our two peoples share common interests in the common struggle to build socialism and safeguard world peace. Their strength comes from the noble principles of proletarian internationalism, from the immortal doctrine of Marxism-Leninism.

    The Czechoslovak Communist Party is commemorating the thirty-fifth anniversary of its revolutionary activities this year. Our Party has achieved historical victories through immense effort and struggle. The working people have become the masters of our country, and we are building socialism, closely united around our beloved Party—the Czechoslovak Communist Party. Caring for people, caring for their happier and better lives, is the goal of our work.

    To achieve this goal, we have done a lot of work. In the eleven years of the people's democratic system, our industrial production has doubled compared to pre-war levels. On a per capita basis, our production in many sectors ranks among the top in the world. The results of national economic construction and cultural construction show that it is possible for us to set huge goals in Czechoslovakia's second Five-Year Plan (1956-1960). The scale of our plan can be demonstrated by the following fact: the planned increase in production in the final year of our Five-Year Plan alone will exceed the entire production of pre-war capitalist Czechoslovakia in 1937.

    Our feelings and relations with the countries of the socialist system, headed by the two great powers of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, are unwavering. This creates all the preconditions for us to raise the living standards of our people in a shorter period of time, further consolidate our position, and promote the struggle for lasting peace and socialism.

    The 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union pointed out broad possibilities and preconditions for further development of the workers' movement, which is of great help to our work. The profound Marxist-Leninist analysis of the current stage of the workers' movement helps the Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries find the correct course. Although the Twentieth Congress closed not long ago, its ideological influence is great, as manifested in the growing activeness of the Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries. They have united more closely and are engaged in creative cooperation in building socialism and consolidating peace.

    The easing of international tensions and the increasingly deep-rooted idea of peaceful coexistence, which has been achieved primarily due to the influence of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, are prerequisites for continuing peaceful construction. At present, the policy of peaceful coexistence and peaceful competition is being successfully used to peacefully adjust relations between countries. Our entire Party and all our people attach great importance to the significant initiatives and contributions of the People's Republic of China in implementing this policy. The People's Republic of China forcefully promoted the consolidation of the peace front of Asian and African countries at the Bandung Conference. The role played by the People's Republic of China at the Bandung Conference is an outstanding proof of the rise of the international prestige of the People's Republic of China.

    Despite the opposition of the imperialists, the People's Republic of China has become a great power of world significance. Attempts to deny your country's right to occupy its legitimate position in the United Nations are bound to fail, and attempts to deny the People's Republic of China's right to liberate China's Taiwan are bound to fail. The ruling figures of the imperialist world describe our desire for peace as weakness and intend to use various means to force us to deviate from the path of socialist construction. Their hopes are bound to be shattered.

    We are loyal to proletarian internationalism, and we will continue to strengthen fraternal cooperation for the sake of peace and socialism!

    I wish the Chinese Communist Party continued great achievements in its work to create a happy and joyful life for all the Chinese people!

    Forward to new victories of Marxist-Leninist thought!

    Long live the glorious Chinese Communist Party!
    Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party

    捷克斯洛伐克共产党代表团团长柯别茨基同志致词亲爱的同志们！
    请允许我首先表示我个人的愉快心情，因为我有机会再一次访问你们这个美好的国家。在前次访问时，我就已真诚地衷心地爱上了它，对崇高的中国人民的建设成就的深深羡慕，已经把我同你们这个美好的国家连结在一起了。
    这次我能率领我们党的代表团来出席中国人民的先锋队及其一切成就的组织者中国共产党的第八次代表大会，对我来说，是很大的光荣。
    我们捷克斯洛伐克共产党代表团欢欣地经过社会主义的国土苏联来到中华人民共和国的美丽的首都北京，来参加这个光荣的大会，履行我们美好的使命，并向你们转达我们党中央委员会的贺词。
    亲爱的同志们！捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会代表全党和全体捷克斯洛伐克人民向中国共产党第八次代表大会致以真诚的同志般的祝贺。
    我国人民始终把中国共产党看作是中国人民的勇敢的领袖，中国人民进行了英勇的斗争，来反对帝国主义的压迫和剥削，争取中国人民的自由，争取中国劳动人民的幸福生活。这部人民解放斗争的史诗以中国人民的光辉胜利作结，这一光辉胜利成了为摆脱殖民压迫而斗争的亚非各国人民的巨大刺激力量和支柱。
    中华人民共和国的社会主义建设、它的国际地位和影响意味着马克思列宁主义的进一步的胜利，为殖民地和附属国人民的解放运动指出了道路，支持了他们争取民族独立的正义斗争。
    我国人民极关切地注视着中国人民的具有历史意义的进展，衷心地为中国社会主义建设的成就而高兴，并把这些成就看作是和平、民主和进步的力量继续蓬勃成长的保证。捷中两国人民的友好关系已经充分地全面地朝着有利我们两国的方向发展了，这种友好关系是牢不可破的，因为我们两国人民在建设社会主义和维护世界和平的共同斗争中有着共同的利益。他们的力量来自无产阶级国际主义的崇高的原则，来自马克思列宁主义的不朽的学说。
    捷克斯洛伐克共产党在今年纪念了自己的革命活动的三十五周年。我们党经过极大的努力和斗争，已经取得了历史性的胜利。劳动人民成了我国的主人，我们紧紧地团结在自己亲爱的党——捷克斯洛伐克共产党的周围，建设着社会主义。关心人，关心他们更幸福更美好的生活，是我们工作的目的。
    为了实现这个目的，我们已做了很多工作。在人民民主制度存在的十一年中，我们的工业生产已比战前增加一倍。按人口平均计算，我国许多部门的生产已居世界的前列。国家经济建设和文化建设的成果表明，我们有可能在捷克斯洛伐克第二个五年计划（1956—1960年）中提出巨大的目标。我们的计划之大，可以从下述事实得到证明：单是我国五年计划最后一年所规划的生产增长额，就将超过战前资本主义捷克斯洛伐克1937年全年的生产。
    我国对以苏联和中华人民共和国两大强国为首的社会主义体系各国的情感和关系是不变的。这一点为我们创造了一切前提，来在较短期间提高我国人民的生活水平，进一步巩固我国的地位，并促进争取持久和平和社会主义的斗争。
    苏联共产党第二十次代表大会指出了进一步开展工人运动的广泛的可能性和前提，这对于我们的工作是很大的帮助。对工人运动现阶段所作的深刻的马克思列宁主义的分析，帮助各国共产党和工人党找到正确的方针。虽然二十次代表大会闭幕不久，但它的思想影响是很大的，这表现在各国共产党和工人党的积极性不断增长，它们已经更加紧密地团结起来，并在建设社会主义和巩固和平方面进行创造性的合作。
    国际紧张局势的和缓，以及首先由于苏联共产党的影响而得以实现的和平共处的思想的日益深入人心，是继续进行和平建设的前提。目前，和平共处和和平竞赛的政策正被成功地用来和平调整国与国间的关系，我们全党和我国全体人民非常重视中华人民共和国在实行这一政策方面的重大的倡导和贡献。中华人民共和国在万隆会议上有力地促进了亚非国家和平阵线的巩固。中华人民共和国在万隆会议上所起的作用，是中华人民共和国的国际威信提高的卓越的证明。
    尽管帝国主义者进行反对，中华人民共和国已经成了具有世界意义的伟大强国。不承认贵国有权在联合国中占有合法地位的企图必定破产，不承认中华人民共和国有权解放中国的台湾的企图必定破产。帝国主义世界当权人物把我们希望和平说成是软弱无能，并打算用各种手段迫使我们离开社会主义建设的道路，他们的希望是必定要破灭的。
    我们是忠于无产阶级国际主义的，我们今后仍将为了和平与社会主义的利益而加强兄弟般的合作！
    祝中国共产党在为中国全体人民创造幸福愉快的生活的工作中继续取得重大的成就！
    向马克思列宁主义思想的新的胜利前进！
    光荣的中国共产党万岁！
              捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会
