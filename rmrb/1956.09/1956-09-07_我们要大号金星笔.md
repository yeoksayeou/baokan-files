    We Want Large-Sized Golden Star Pens
    The large-sized Golden Star fountain pens produced by the Shanghai Golden Star Pen Factory have good nib quality, are durable, have a large ink sac, and hold a lot of ink. They are very popular among the masses because you don't have to worry about running out of ink when working outside or taking notes in class. However, in recent years, large-sized Golden Star pens have been impossible to buy on the market. We wrote to the Shanghai Golden Star Pen Factory to ask about this, and were told that large-sized Golden Star pens are no longer produced in order to save raw materials.
    We believe that although large-sized Golden Star pens use more materials, their advantages, such as holding more ink and being more durable, cannot be replaced by other pens. Producing large-sized Golden Star pens cannot be said to be a waste. We hope that the Shanghai Golden Star Pen Factory will continue to produce large-sized Golden Star pens.　Wang Zugao

    我们要大号金星笔
    上海金星笔厂出产的大号金星钢笔，笔尖质量好，经久耐用，皮管大，装水多，外出工作和上课记笔记不愁墨水不够用，因此很受群众欢迎。可是，近年来大号金星笔在市场上根本买不到了。我们写信到上海金星笔厂去问，据说是为了节约原材料，大号金星笔不再生产了。
    我们认为，大号金星笔虽然多用些材料，但它的装水多、耐用等优点，都是别的笔不能代替的，生产大号金星笔不能说是浪费。希望上海金星笔厂继续生产大号金星笔。　汪祖高
