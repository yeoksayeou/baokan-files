    The Mud Dauber is Commonly Called the "螟蛉虫" (Mínglíng chóng)
　　Zhou Jianren
    In July, in my short article "About the Panda," I mentioned the mud dauber. In ancient times, due to "lack of careful observation," it was mistakenly believed that this type of slender-waisted wasp, the mud dauber, only had males and no females. It could only capture small green caterpillars called "螟蛉" (mínglíng), seal them in mud nests, and raise them as its own sons to carry on the lineage. Because of this legend, people began calling taking someone else's son as their own as "螟蛉子" (mínglíng zǐ) (also known as an adopted son), and colloquially called the mud dauber "螟蛉虫" (mínglíng chóng).
    When I was young, on summer mornings, my grandmother often pointed to the slender-waisted wasps, with their blue-black bodies, walking on the windowsill and said, "The 螟蛉虫 (mínglíng chóng) are here." My mother also often said this. They both grew up in different, distant rural areas, but used the same name, showing that the name 螟蛉虫 (mínglíng chóng) was very common. The 螟蛉虫 (mínglíng chóng) and the paper wasp belong to the same family of wasps, but the 螟蛉虫 (mínglíng chóng) are not as intimidating as the paper wasp. The paper wasp is a yellow wasp that often uses dry plant fibers to build gray-black, upside-down lotus pod-shaped nests under the eaves, making them commonly seen and well-known. Birds often retract their feet under their abdomen when flying, but cranes stretch their two long legs straight behind their tails when flying. The paper wasp, however, drags its third leg under its abdomen when flying, hence the name "拖脚黄蜂" (tuō jiǎo huángfēng) - "dragging-foot wasp." If a person offends it, it will sting them. Elders in the countryside say it can chase people for nine li (4.5 kilometers), so it is also called "九里?" (jiǔ lǐ ? - nine li ?), but this is an exaggeration and unreliable. The paper wasp has this bad reputation and is often killed when seen, but the 螟蛉虫 (mínglíng chóng) has a good reputation for raising the offspring of other insects as its own, so people look at it differently and never kill it. It certainly never harms people.
    On summer mornings, the 螟蛉虫 (mínglíng chóng) not only often walks on the windowsill, but also often comes to the edge of the lotus pot, poking its head and crawling around. When the water in the lotus pot is shallow, soft mud is exposed around the edges, and I suspect it comes to collect the soft mud to build its mud nest.
    I also often see the 螟蛉虫 (mínglíng chóng) on summer evenings. At this time, the spider has just finished building its web and is resting in the center, ready to catch flying insects to eat. The 螟蛉虫 (mínglíng chóng) also comes at this time, flying and bumping under the web, as if searching for something. A few days later, if you pay a little attention, you will find that the spider web is old and dusty, clearly empty, and the spider has been dragged away by the 螟蛉虫 (mínglíng chóng).
    It turns out that there are different types of 螟蛉虫 (mínglíng chóng), and they do not all catch small green caterpillars. Some do catch spiders. In my hometown, in the courtyard where the lotus pots were placed, on the south-facing window lattice, many mud nests (also called nurseries) were made in the summer, shaped like shelled hazelnuts. The mud nests that had been sealed with captives and eggs laid inside were round on top and had no protrusions. I opened a few mud nests to see, and they all contained spiders. The spiders were all alive, but seemed to be asleep, with their legs slightly able to move, but unable to crawl. Zoologists tell us that when the 螟蛉虫 (mínglíng chóng) seals the captives in the mud nest, it uses its stinger to sting it, like giving it an anesthetic injection. The captives are anesthetized, but still alive, so they do not rot. After the larvae of the 螟蛉虫 (mínglíng chóng) hatch, they can open their mouths and eat fresh meat. When the stored food is eaten, it grows up, pupates, and then turns into an adult insect, breaks through the mud nest and flies away. If you open the remaining mud nests, you will see the outer skin of the pupa or a small amount of leftover food inside. The mud nests on the south-facing window all contain spiders, showing that the larvae of the 螟蛉虫 (mínglíng chóng) eat spiders.
    However, once I dismantled a mud nest from the branch of a potted small tree, and instead of spiders, there were several inchworms. Inchworms are the larvae of moths. They are named because they stretch and bend when walking, resembling the shape of using a bow to measure land in ancient times. Those inchworms were not like the sealed spiders, as if drunk and infatuated. They jumped happily when they fell on the surface of the pot, very fresh, could it be that they had not been given an anesthetic injection? This remains a question.
    Later, in the Shanghai International Cemetery, I saw that some elaborate graves had stone railings around the perimeter, with flowers carved on the top. There were many mud dauber mud nests between the flower patterns. I opened a few to see, and sealed inside was another type of animal, several small hairy caterpillars, also very fresh, not as intoxicated as the spiders, but not as lively as the inchworms I had seen before.
    However, no matter how lively they are, if the stored live food can struggle, it is unsafe for the eggs or small larvae of the 螟蛉虫 (mínglíng chóng). If the egg is among the active moth and butterfly larvae, the egg will be crushed or broken if the larvae struggle, which is very dangerous. But entomologists tell us: the eggs of the 螟蛉虫 (mínglíng chóng) are not laid on top of or in the middle of the live food pile, but hang below a short, thin, thread-like object. The thread-like object is suspended from the roof, away from the live food. The captives below are twisting, but cannot touch it. After the larvae of the 螟蛉虫 (mínglíng chóng) hatch, they go down along the eggshell, and their heads can touch the food to bite and eat. If the live food moves, the larvae will immediately shrink back, away from the food, and the commotion below will not harm it. When the larvae are appropriately strong, the live food is even weaker and more incompetent, and it comes down to the food pile and eats with peace of mind.
    It is not only the 螟蛉虫 (mínglíng chóng) that catches small animals to feed its larvae, there are also many other types of Hymenoptera insects in the wasp family that do this. The slender-waisted wasp (scientific name Sphex), which is larger than the 螟蛉虫 (mínglíng chóng), catches crickets to feed its larvae. The name cricket is called this from Zhejiang to Beijing, but Shanghai calls it "催绩" (cuī jì), which is the same meaning as "促织" (cù zhī) (this name is used in "Four Classes of People"). Usually, the cricket is pronounced as "趋趋" (qū qū), and generally people do not know how to write the characters 趋织 (qū zhī). Some popular books often write it as 蛐蛐 (qū qū). Once Pinyin is used, these problems will of course be solved.
    When I was young, I saw slender-waisted wasps larger than the 螟蛉虫 (mínglíng chóng) catching cockroaches (also known as蜚蠊 - fěilián). The slender-waisted wasp bit one of the cockroach's antennae, and the two sides pulled hard, like tug-of-war; or like sawing wood, sometimes the cockroach was pulled away by the slender-waisted wasp, and sometimes the cockroach pulled back. At first, the cockroach seemed to be very strong; after being pulled away a distance by the slender-waisted wasp, the cockroach retreated back with great force. But after some time, the cockroach gradually appeared unable to support itself, and its six limbs were weak. Finally, it was pulled away by the slender-waisted wasp. Are cockroaches so easily fatigued? Obviously not. Probably when it was caught by the wasp, it had been given an anesthetic injection, and by this time the poison had taken effect, and it gradually couldn't hold on.

    果蠃俗叫螟蛉虫
　　周建人
    7月间，我写的“关于熊猫”这篇短文里曾经提到果蠃。古人因为“察物未精”，误为果蠃这种细腰蜂只有雄的，没有雌的，它只能捕捉叫做螟蛉的小青虫封在泥房里，养成为自己的儿子以传代。因了这种传说，人们遂叫领别人的儿子为己子为“螟蛉子”（又称义子），并且通俗又叫果蠃为螟蛉虫了。
    我幼时，夏天早晨，祖母常指着在窗槛上行走的，身子呈蓝黑色的细腰蜂说：“螟蛉虫来了。”母亲也常这样说的。她们两人原生长在距离很遥远的不同的农村里，都用同一的名称，可见螟蛉虫这名称是很通用的。螟蛉虫与拖脚黄蜂同属胡蜂类，但不像拖脚黄蜂的吓人。拖脚黄蜂是身子黄色的蜂，常常用枯物纤维在屋檐下做成灰黑色的倒挂莲蓬形的窠，因此为人们所习见和熟知。鸟飞行时常常把脚缩在腹部下面，鹤飞行时却把二条长脚直挺挺地伸在尾巴下面。拖脚黄蜂飞行时第三脚却拖在腹下面，因此有“拖脚黄蜂”的名称。人如触犯它，它就用刺刺人。乡下父老之辈说它能追逐人到九里之远，因此又叫它九里?，但这是夸张之谈，靠不住的。拖脚黄蜂既有此恶名，被人看见就常被扑杀，螟蛉虫却有抚养他虫之子为自己的善名，人们就另眼相看，从不扑杀它，它的确也从不伤害人。
    夏天的早上，螟蛉虫不仅常常来窗槛上行走，它又常常来荷花缸边探头探脑地爬行。荷花缸里水浅时，四边有软泥露出水外，我推测它是来采取软泥去造泥房的。
    夏天傍晚也常常看到螟蛉虫。这时候蜘蛛恰好已修好网，栖息网中央，准备捉飞来的虫子吃。螟蛉虫此时也来了，在网下面一撞一撞地飞行，好像在找寻东西似的。过几天后，你如稍稍留意，就会发觉，那蛛网已破旧，而且已积有灰尘，分明网已空了，蜘蛛已被螟蛉虫拖去。
    原来螟蛉虫有不同的种类，它们并不都捉小青虫的，有的确实在捉蜘蛛。在我故乡放荷花缸的庭中向南的窗门格子上，夏季做着不少泥房（又叫育儿室），形状略像带壳的榛子，已经封入俘虏和产下卵的泥房上面是圆圆的，没有突起物。我拆开几个泥房来看，藏的都是蜘蛛。蜘蛛都是活的，但像睡着似的，脚略能动弹，但不会爬行。动物学者告诉我们说，螟蛉虫把俘虏封入泥房时，常用尾针刺它一下，好像打了麻药针，俘虏就麻醉了，但是仍活着，所以不会腐烂，螟蛉虫的幼虫孵出后，就可以张口吃鲜肉；到了把存粮吃完时，它也长大了，就化为蛹，再化为成虫，穿破泥房飞去。如拆开残存的泥房来看，泥房内残留着蛹的外皮或更有少许吃残的东西，那南窗的泥房都封藏着蜘蛛，可见那螟蛉虫的幼虫是吃蜘蛛的。
    可是有一次我从盆栽的一株小树的枝上的一个泥房里拆出来的却不是蜘蛛而是数条尺蠖。尺蠖是蛾类的幼虫。因为行走时一伸一屈像古时用弓量地的形状，故名。那尺蠖却不像被封藏的蜘蛛的如醉如痴，它们落到盆面就欢跳，很鲜活的，莫非它们没有打过麻醉针吗？至今是一个存留的疑问。
    后来在上海的万国公墓里，看到有的讲究的坟的外围有石头的围槛，上部凿着花，花纹间有不少螟蛉虫泥房，我拆开几个来看，封藏的又是另一种动物，几条幼小的毛虫，也是很鲜活的，不像蜘蛛的沉醉，但活泼不及以前所见的尺蠖。
    可是不论活泼的程度怎样，如果贮藏的活粮食能挣扎，对于螟蛉虫的卵或幼小的幼虫都是不安全的。如果卵在活动的蛾蝶幼虫中间，幼虫挣扎起来，卵会被挤坏或弄碎，这是很危险的。但昆虫学者告诉我们：原来螟蛉虫的卵不生产在活粮食的堆上面或中间，它却挂在一段短短细丝状物的下面，细丝状物则悬挂在房顶下面，离开活粮食的，下面的俘虏在扭动，也触不到它。螟蛉虫的幼虫孵化出来后，缘卵壳而下，头能触到粮食，咬来吃如果活粮食有所动惮，幼虫就立刻缩回去，离开了粮食，下面的骚动伤害不到它。到了幼虫适当壮大，活粮食此时已愈加衰弱无能，它就下来在粮食堆上安心咬吃了。
    捕小动物喂幼虫的不只是螟蛉虫，还有其他不少种的胡蜂类的膜翅目动物也是这样的。比螟蛉虫较大形的细腰蜂（学名Sphex），捕趋织给她的幼虫做粮食。趋织这名称从浙东以至北京等地都这样叫，只是上海却叫作催绩，都是促织（“四生谱”上用此名）的意思。通常把趋织念成“趋趋”的声音，一般不知道趋织二字怎么写，有些通俗小书上往往写作蛐蛐。一旦使用拼音文字后，这等问题当然解决了。
    我幼时看到过比螟蛉虫较大的细腰蜂捕捉蟑螂（亦称蜚蠊）的情况。那细腰蜂咬住蟑螂的一支须，两方用力拉，好像拔河；又好像拉锯的，有时被细腰蜂拉走，有时被蟑螂拉回去。起初蟑螂显得很有力气；被细腰蜂拉走一段，蟑螂即猛力退回去。但过一些时候，蟑螂渐渐显得不支，六肢乏力，终于被细腰蜂拉去。蟑螂是这样容易疲乏的吗？显然不是的，大概被蜂捉住时，已被打了一针麻醉剂，到此时毒发，渐渐支持不住了。
    树枝上的螟蛉虫的泥房，预备装小青虫。装好俘虏并产卵后，顶上封好，喇叭形的瓶口也咬掉，遂成榛子形的一颗泥房。（从梭厄比的笔记本描绘出来的）
