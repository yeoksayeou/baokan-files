    Why We Filmed "The Spring River Flows East"
    Zheng Junli
    Some people believe that "The Spring River Flows East" is a remake of the old "Pipa Ji" – Zhang Zhongliang is a modern version of Cai Yong, Su Fen is Zhao Wuniang, Li Zhen and Wen Yan are the Niu sisters, and Mazi's mother is the incarnation of Zhang Guangcai. From the plot, this impression may be created, but I really remember that when Chu Sheng was writing the script, we never thought of "Pipa Ji." Our attention was instead attracted by some social tragedies that were quite common at the time – some people left their wives in Shanghai (called "wives of the occupied areas"), went to the inland to "join the war of resistance" and remarried ("wives of the war of resistance"), and after the victory, they "returned home in glory" and "took over" new favorites ("wives of the takeover" – in the play, He Wenyan was originally called "wife of the takeover," but the Kuomintang censorship authorities thought it was too provocative and forced it to be changed to "secret wife"). This "plot" contained strong practical significance and drama. We once used it to plan the outline of the plot. We were not satisfied with the plot itself, but wanted to reveal the social contradictions buried underneath it.
    Among many different opinions, I personally agree with the following view:
    "'The Spring River Flows East' uses Zhang Zhongliang as a guide, or rather, uses the separation and reunion of Zhang Zhongliang's family as a medium, to express the opposition between the exploiters and the exploited; to reflect the worst phenomenon that occurred in this war: those who enjoy happiness enjoy it permanently; those who suffer hardships suffer them permanently. The fruits of the war were stolen, and the people are still in deep water. In this way, 'The Spring River Flows East' must not be regarded as a cliche of a faithless story... it contains the roots of today's life of pain, bearing the grievances and sorrows of the times. What is contrasted here is not Zhang Zhongliang and Su Fen; but the group of Wang Lizhen and the group of Su Fen and the old mother. Here, I see the practical significance of 'The Spring River Flows East,' which is the theme of this film." (See Nian Ying's "Review of The Spring River Flows East" in the "Times Daily")
    Critics also have different opinions on the ending of the film, in which Su Fen commits suicide – the good are harmed and the wicked triumph. Some people think that the film's handling is correct, because "the contradictions of the present society cannot be solved within the present society, and the problem is not with individual culprits, but with the social foundation that produces evil. Is the struggle between good and evil solved by killing a butcher? Look, there are thousands of butchers! Even if Pang Haogong and Wang Lizhen fail, they, the entire licentious and shameless class, still exist, still drinking and laughing. Even if Su Fen is saved, she, the class they persecute, is still suffering... What is currently strong and dominant, we have seen it declining; what is currently weak and harmed, we have seen it growing and rising." (See Zhou Xiumu's "On the Ending of Two Films" in the "Times Daily") Some people also believe that "Su Fen's suicide can prompt us to further understand the ferocity of the dark forces and make us hate and take revenge even more!" (See "Conclusion of the Symposium on The Spring River Flows East" in the "China New News" in Nanchang) These opinions are somewhat close to what we thought at the time.
    But the ending of the film is too tragic after all. It arouses hatred and may also cause depression. Although we hinted through Su Fen's mouth that Kang'er should take Zhang Zhongmin's path, a few weak words are no match for the bloody tragedy. The audience felt emotionally unsatisfied. At that time, a foreign audience, Y. S. Griggs, wrote to us:
    "Allow me to venture to express an opinion. You have overlooked one key point: that a film should not only expose the truth, but also try to clearly point out a way to break through the difficulties. This film should not end with Su Fen's suicide, but should write about her going to the countryside to live with her uncle and doing useful work. In this way, on the one hand, it can reduce some excessive and artistically worthless crying, and on the other hand, it can give courage to millions of Chinese women who are similar to Su Fen."
    This enthusiastic foreign audience's opinion represents the views of many people and is worth our attention. Especially after the national liberation, thousands of people like Su Fen have freed themselves from the fate of being insulted and harmed and bravely stood up. We feel even more that the original treatment (although it played a certain role at the time and place) cannot meet the wishes of the current broad audience. We once planned to reshoot the ending – writing about Su Fen taking Kang'er and the old mother back to their hometown (guerrilla area) by boat, setting sail east on the turbulent river... Later, considering that similar shortcomings are not limited to one place in the whole play, only adding local repairs and modifications would easily lead to incongruity. It is better to preserve the original appearance of a specific historical period of creation, and finally gave up this idea.
    As one of the authors, I am happy to hear that the old work has the opportunity to be re-released and distributed, but I am not very relaxed when I see that the film has quite serious shortcomings (although I know that there is no need to carry the burden for these historical issues now). I will simply present some of my previous and subsequent views (the main author of this film, Comrade Cai Chusheng, is currently abroad and has not returned. What I have written above is only my personal opinion) and respectfully await the comrades' corrections.

    为什么拍摄“一江春水向东流”
    郑君里
    有人认为“一江春水向东流”是古老的“琵琶记”的翻版——张忠良是现代衣冠的蔡伯喈，素芬是赵五娘，丽珍、文艳是牛氏，骂子的老母是张广才的化身。从情节上看，可能造成这种印象，但我确实记得，在楚生写作剧本时，我们从未想起“琵琶记”。我们的注意力毋宁是被当时相当普遍的一些社会悲剧所吸引——有些人丢下了妻子在上海（被称作“沦陷夫人”），到内地“参加抗战”又重婚（“抗战夫人”），胜利后“衣锦荣归”，又“接收”了新宠（“接收夫人”——剧中何文艳原称“接收夫人”，国民党检查机关认为太刺激，强改为“秘密夫人”）。这个“情节”包含了强烈的现实意义和戏剧性。我们曾经依照它来规划出剧情的轮廓。我们并不满足于这个情节的本身，而是想揭发埋藏在它底下的社会矛盾。
    在许多不同的意见中间，我个人是比较同意以下的一个看法：
    “‘一江春水向东流’是以张忠良为引线，或者说是以张忠良一家的分聚离合为媒介，来表达剥削者与被剥削者间的对立；来反映这一次战争中所发生的最坏的现象：享乐的永久在享乐；吃苦的永久在吃苦。战争的果实被窃取了，人民依旧在水深火热中。这样，‘一江春水向东流’绝不能看成是俗套的负情故事，……它正包含着今日生活苦痛的根源，承荷着时代的冤屈和悲苦。这里对比的，不是张忠良和素芬；而是王丽珍的一群与素芬、老母亲的一群。在这里，我见到了‘一江春水向东流’的现实意义，它是这片子的主题。”（见“时代日报”念英作“评一江春水向东流”）
    批评家们对于影片以素芬自杀——好人被害、恶人胜利为结局，也有不同的意见。有一部分人认为影片的处理是对的，因为“现社会的矛盾不能在现社会内解决，问题不在于个别的罪魁祸首，而在于产生罪恶的社会基础。杀了一个屠夫，就算解决了善恶的斗争吗？你看，还有万千屠夫！就算庞浩公王丽珍们失败了，但他们，整个荒淫无耻的阶级却依旧存在，依旧在饮酒和欣笑。就算素芬得救，但她，他们被逼害的阶级仍旧在受苦和遭难……目前强大、占上风的，我们已看到它正在衰亡、下降；目前弱小、被损害的，我们看到它正在生长、上升。”（见“时代日报”周修睦“论两部影片的结局”）也有人认为“素芬的自杀可以促使我们更进一步认识了黑暗势力的狰狞，使我们更懂得憎恨和复仇！”（见南昌“中国新报”上“一江春水向东流座谈会结论”）这些意见多少接近我们当时的想法。
    但影片的结局毕竟太惨了，它激发起仇恨，也可能引起丧沮消沉。我们虽然通过素芬的口，提示过抗儿应该走张忠民的道路，但几句单薄的话究竟抵不过血淋淋的惨剧。观众在情绪上感到不满足，当时有一位外国观众Y．S．格力葛曾写信给我们：
    “容我冒昧陈述一点意见，你们忽略一个要点：就是一部电影不仅要揭发真理，同时还得尽量明白地指出一条打破困难的路。这张片子不能以素芬自杀为结局，而应该写她去乡间跟叔叔一起过活，去做有利的工作。这样，一方面可以减免一些过多而没有艺术价值的哭泣，另一方面又可以给千百万与素芬相似的中国妇女们一股勇气。”
    这位热心的外国观众的意见代表了许多人的看法，很值得我们重视。特别在全国解放之后，千千万万与素芬同道的人们都挣脱了被侮辱与被损害的命运，勇敢地站了起来，我们更加感到原来的处理（在当时当地虽曾发生一定的作用），不能满足当前广大观众的愿望。我们一度打算过改摄结局——写素芬带着抗儿和老母坐船回乡（游击区），在怒涛滚滚的大江中扬帆东去……，后来考虑到在全剧中，类似的缺点不止一处，只加局部的缝补修改反而容易弄到不伦不类。一个特定的历史时期的创作仍以保存其本来面目为宜，终于放弃了这个想法。
    作为作者之一；当我听到旧作有再版发行的机会，是高兴的，一待看到影片存在着相当严重的缺点（虽然明知现在不必为这些历史问题背包袱）也不太轻松。姑且把自己前前后后的一些看法和盘托出（本片主要作者蔡楚生同志目前出国未回，以上所写的仅是我个人的意见）敬候同志们的指正。
