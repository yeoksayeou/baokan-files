Xinhua News Agency, 7th. Xinhua News Agency reporter Li Feng reports: The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry may affect the normal production of steel due to the lack of scrap steel. Four steel plants are at risk of stopping production in September. Therefore, all regions are urgently required to hand in scrap steel.

    A bureau director of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry told reporters that when scrap steel affects steel making, the open hearth steelmaking must use a certain amount of scrap steel to maintain normal production; the electric furnace can't produce without scrap steel. Because it takes more than one ton of scrap steel to refine a ton of alloy steel.

    The director said that the reason for the lack of scrap steel is mainly that most of the ministries and provinces and cities that should hand in scrap steel have not handed in according to the plan. This year, all ministries and provinces and cities should hand in a total of more than 220,000 tons of scrap steel to the state, but in fact, only 73,000 tons were handed in from January to July. The 90,000 tons of scrap steel originally stocked by the Recycling Bureau of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry has also been used up. At present, open hearth steelmaking has to use some scrap pig iron instead of scrap steel, but scrap iron is also lacking. Therefore, if the ministries and provinces and cities that have not completed the task of handing in scrap steel can't quickly hand in enough scrap steel to the state, four steel plants of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry may stop production in September due to lack of scrap steel, and may affect the normal production of steel before the end of the year. In this way, the state's supply of steel will inevitably become more insufficient, affecting the supply of steel to various ministries and provinces and cities.

    According to the director, the reason why the scrap steel recycling task has not been completed is mainly because the relevant ministries and provinces and cities have used some scrap steel as finished products due to the lack of steel. However, according to the investigation by the personnel of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry stationed in various places to recycle scrap iron and steel, some ministries, provinces and cities have not reasonably utilized the usable scrap steel, and handed in the unusable ones. Instead, they heard that the supply of steel was insufficient, so they hoarded all the scrap steel as a reserve; some ministries or provinces have hoarded tens of thousands of tons.

    The source of the state's scrap steel, in addition to relying on the contributions from various ministries, provinces and cities, also includes a large part from the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry purchasing scrap steel from state-owned enterprises or scattered among the people. The ministry hopes that enterprises and people in various places with scrap steel will actively sell scrap steel to support the state's steelmaking. The main problem currently existing in this regard is that some areas reflect that the purchase price is too low. The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry has allocated a portion of funds to increase the purchase price in areas with difficult transportation.

### 国家急待各地上缴废钢  9月份四个炼钢厂可能因缺少废钢而停产

    国家急待各地上缴废钢
    9月份四个炼钢厂可能因缺少废钢而停产
    新华社7日讯　新华社记者李峰报道：冶金工业部因为缺少废钢，可能影响钢的正常生产，9月份有四个炼钢厂有停止生产的危险。因此，急待各地把废钢上缴。
    冶金工业部一位局长对记者讲到废钢对炼钢影响的时候说，平炉炼钢必须用一定数量的废钢才能维持正常生产；电炉没有废钢，也无法生产。因为炼一吨合金钢就需要一吨以上的废钢。
    这位局长说，废钢缺少的原因，主要是应该上缴废钢的大多数的部和省市，没有按计划上缴。今年各部和各省市总共应该缴给国家二十二万多吨废钢，实际上1月到7月只缴了七万三千吨。冶金工业部回收局原来库存的九万吨废钢也已经用光。目前平炉炼钢，不得不用部分废生铁来代替废钢，可是废铁也同样感到缺乏。因此，如果未完成上缴废钢任务的部和省市，不能很快缴给国家足够数量的废钢，冶金工业部9月份有四个炼钢厂就可能因缺少废钢而停产，并且可能影响这个部年底以前钢的正常生产。这样，就又势必使得国家钢材供应更加不足，影响供应各部和各省市的钢材。
    据这位局长说，废钢回收任务没有完成，主要是有关的部和省市，因为缺少钢材，把一部分废钢当作成材利用了。但是，据冶金部驻各地回收废钢铁的人员调查，也有些部、省和市，并没有把能利用的废钢合理地利用，把不能利用的上缴，而是听说钢材供应不足，就把所有的废钢都积压起来，当作后备了；有的部或省，已经积压了上万吨。
    国家废钢的来源，除去依靠各部、各省市上缴以外，还有很大一部分是由冶金部收购国营企业的或散在民间的废钢。这个部希望存有废钢的企业和各地人民，踊跃出售废钢，支援国家炼钢。这方面目前存在的主要问题是，有些地区反映收购价格偏低。冶金工业部已经拨出一部分款项，用来提高那些交通运输困难地区的收购价格。
