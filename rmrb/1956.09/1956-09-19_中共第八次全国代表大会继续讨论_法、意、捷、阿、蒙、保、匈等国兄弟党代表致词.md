Xinhua News Agency, 18th dispatch: The Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China continued on the afternoon of the 18th.

The executive chairmen of today's meeting were: Liu Geping, Li Jingquan, Lu Dingyi, Zheng Weisan, Zhou Yang, Hu Yaobang, Qian Ying, Nie Rongzhen, Tan Zheng.

The representatives who spoke at today's meeting were Lin Tie, Peng Dehuai, Bo Yibo, and Xiao Huina. In their speeches, they unanimously agreed with the Central Committee's political report, the report on amending the Party Constitution, and the report on the proposals for the Second Five-Year Plan, and expressed their opinions on relevant issues such as rural work, military work, and economic construction.

The head of the French Communist Party delegation, Duclos, the head of the Italian Communist Party delegation, Scoccimarro, the head of the Czechoslovak Communist Party delegation, Kopetsky, the head of the Albanian Labor Party delegation, Hoxha, the head of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party delegation, Damba, the head of the Bulgarian Communist Party delegation, Yugov, and the head of the Hungarian Working People's Party delegation, Kadar, delivered speeches at today's meeting. They were warmly welcomed by the representatives. When they began their speeches and when they finished, all the representatives stood up and gave them stormy applause that lasted for a long time.

Lin Tie, First Secretary of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the CPC, said in his speech today that after the realization of advanced agricultural cooperativization in Hebei Province, this year's wheat harvest, although reduced due to rainstorms, was still 600 million jin more than last year, showing the superiority of advanced agricultural cooperatives.

Lin Tie's speech focused on the problems and lessons learned in the first year of work after the realization of cooperativization. He said that the most important of these experiences is: consult with the masses more, never forget the mass line; be vigilant against subjectivism, and guard against one-sidedness in guiding ideology.

Comrade Duclos then delivered a speech. When he said, "In the near future, nothing will be able to prevent the French Republic and the People's Republic of China from establishing normal relations in the common interests of the two countries and in the interests of peace," the audience burst into thunderous applause.

Next, Comrade Scoccimarro and Comrade Kopetsky successively delivered speeches at the meeting, and their speeches were repeatedly interrupted by warm applause.

Comrade Peng Dehuai, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, then spoke on military work. He reviewed the heroic and arduous road that the Chinese People's Liberation Army has traveled, and pointed out that resolutely obeying the Party's correct leadership over the army, maintaining close ties with the people, and forever maintaining the essence of the people's revolutionary army are the fundamental guarantees for our army's victory.

Peng Dehuai pointed out that the task of our army in the new period is to defend the socialist construction of the motherland, defend the sovereignty, territorial integrity, and security of the country, be ready to liberate Taiwan at any time, and consolidate domestic peace and order. He said that the socialist nature of our country is the fundamental starting point for determining that our army adopts a strategic defensive policy. We will never invade others, but we will never allow others to invade us.

Peng Dehuai introduced the tremendous work that has been carried out in national defense construction over the past seven years. He pointed out that the Chinese People's Liberation Army has been transformed from a force basically composed of single infantry into a combined arms force, completing a major transformation in the history of our army. Modern national defense engineering constructions have been carried out on the national defense front lines and in strategic key points in the interior. The compulsory military service system has been implemented. He said that over the past seven years, the troops of the Chinese People's Liberation Army that have collectively transferred to production and construction and the officers and soldiers who have been transferred and demobilized have reached 5 million people. At present, the number of troops, including the newly recruited soldiers, has been reduced by more than 2.7 million compared with the highest number at the time of the national liberation. He said: "We fully agree with the Soviet Union's proposal for international disarmament. As long as an agreement can be reached on this issue, we are still willing to further reduce our troops."

The meeting continued after a twenty-minute break.

Comrade Hoxha delivered a speech. He said: "The people of our two countries, one a people with a very small number and the other a people with a very large number, and geographically located at the two ends of our socialist camp, neither the former nor the latter can hinder the true friendship between our two countries, nor can it hinder the close cooperation that is beneficial to our two countries." All the representatives welcomed Hoxha's remarks with the warmest applause.

Comrade Damba then delivered a speech. He presented a banner with the inscription "Congratulations to the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China" on behalf of the Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party to the presidium of the congress. At this time, everyone stood up, and the hall resounded with lasting applause.

Comrade Yugov, on behalf of the Bulgarian communists and all the people, warmly congratulated the Chinese workers and peasants on their great achievements. Yugov's speech was interrupted again and again by warm applause.

Comrade Kadar then delivered a speech and read out the congratulatory message from the Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party. He presented a banner to the congress on behalf of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party, with the inscription "Workers of all countries, unite!" When Executive Chairman Nie Rongzhen accepted the banner, all the representatives stood up, and the hall resounded with stormy applause.

Comrade Bo Yibo, member of the CPC Central Committee, focused on how to rationally solve the relationship between accumulation and consumption in the process of socialist industrialization. He said that in the past few years, our handling of the relationship between accumulation and consumption has been basically correct; the changes in the proportional relationship between accumulation and consumption are basically in line with the political and economic development of our country and the needs of socialist industrialization. He believes that in the next few years, the proportion of accumulation in the national income should be no less than 20%, or slightly higher, which is more stable. He said that the proposal of this ratio figure is based on the practice of economic development in our country in recent years, and is an attempt to conduct a preliminary analysis of the main aspects of the relationship between accumulation and consumption. It can only be used as a reference for determining the correct proportional relationship. Bo Yibo said that correctly solving the relationship between accumulation and consumption will not only ensure the rapid development of industrial construction in our country, but also ensure the gradual improvement of the people's consumption level, so that the lives of our people will get better year by year.

The last speaker at today's meeting was Xiao Huina, Director of the Wuhan Women's Federation. She cited vivid examples to illustrate that improving the lives of workers cannot be solved simply by increasing wages and relief. On the one hand, wages must be gradually increased and welfare facilities must be increased on the basis of developing production. On the other hand, it is also necessary to advocate thrift and diligence in managing the household and planning expenditures among the masses.

The meeting ended at 7 p.m. The meeting will continue tomorrow.

    据新华社18日讯　中国共产党第八次全国代表大会18日下午继续举行。
    今天大会的执行主席是：刘格平、李井泉、陆定一、郑位三、周扬、胡耀邦、钱瑛、聂荣臻、谭政。
    在今天大会上发言的代表有林铁、彭德怀、薄一波、肖慧纳四人。他们在发言中一致同意中央委员会所作的政治报告、修改党章的报告和第二个五年计划的建议的报告，并且分别就农村工作、军事工作和经济建设等有关问题发表了意见。
    法国共产党代表团团长杜克洛、意大利共产党代表团团长斯科奇马罗、捷克斯洛伐克共产党代表团团长柯别茨基、阿尔巴尼亚劳动党代表团团长霍查、蒙古人民革命党代表团团长达姆巴、保加利亚共产党代表团团长于哥夫、匈牙利劳动人民党代表团团长卡达尔，先后在今天的大会上致词。他们受到了代表们的热烈欢迎。在他们开始致词和致词结束的时候，代表们都全体起立，暴风雨般的掌声经久不息。
    中共河北省委员会第一书记林铁今天在发言中说，河北省在实现高级农业合作化以后，今年小麦收成，虽然因雨灾减产，但总产量仍比去年多了六亿斤，显示了高级农业合作社的优越性。
    林铁的发言着重谈到了实现合作化以后第一年工作中所发生的问题和所取得的经验教训。他说，这些经验中最重要的一条是：多与群众商量，时刻不忘走群众路线；警惕主观主义，谨防指导思想的片面性。
    杜克洛同志接着致词，当他讲到“在最近的将来，没有任何东西能够阻止法兰西共和国和中华人民共和国，在两国共同的利益以及和平的利益上，建立正常的关系”的时候，全场响起了雷动的掌声。
    接着，斯科奇马罗同志、柯别茨基同志，相继在大会上致词，他们的讲话多次被热烈的掌声所打断。
    中共中央政治局委员彭德怀同志接着就军事工作发言。他回顾了中国人民解放军所走过的英勇奋斗的道路，指出坚决服从党对军队的正确领导，密切联系人民群众，永远保持人民革命军队的本质，这就是我军取得胜利的根本保证。
    彭德怀指出，我军在新时期的任务，就是保卫祖国的社会主义建设，保卫国家的主权、领土完整和安全，随时准备解放台湾，巩固国内和平秩序。他说，我国的社会主义本质，是决定我军采取战略防御方针的根本出发点。我们决不侵略别人，但是也决不容许别人侵略我们。
    彭德怀介绍了七年来在国防建设方面所进行的巨大的工作。他指出，中国人民解放军已由基本上是单一步兵组成的部队建成为诸兵种合成的部队，完成了我军有史以来的重大转变。在国防前线和纵深战略要点进行了现代化的国防工程建筑。开始实行了义务兵役制。他说，七年来，中国人民解放军集体转入生产建设的部队和转业、复员的官兵已达五百万人，目前军队员额包括征集的新兵在内，比全国解放时的最高额已经裁减了二百七十多万人。他说：“我们完全同意苏联提出的国际裁军的建议，只要在这个问题上能够达成协议，我们仍然愿意进一步裁减我们的军队。”　　休息二十分钟以后继续开会。　
　霍查同志致词。他说：“我们两国人民，一个是人数极少的人民，一个是人数极多的人民，而且在地理上处于我们社会主义阵营的两端，可是无论前一点或后一点，都不能阻碍我们两国的真正友谊，都不能阻碍有利于我们两国的紧密合作。”全体代表用最热烈的掌声欢迎霍查的这番话。
    达姆巴同志接着致词，他并代表蒙古人民革命党中央委员会把一面写着“向中国共产党第八次全国代表大会祝贺”的锦旗赠给大会主席团。这时，全体起立，会场上响起经久不息的掌声。
    于哥夫同志代表保加利亚的共产党员和全体人民热烈祝贺中国工人和农民所取得的巨大成就。于哥夫的致词一次又一次地被热烈的掌声所打断。
    卡达尔同志接着致词，并宣读了匈牙利劳动人民党中央委员会的贺词。他代表匈牙利劳动人民党中央委员会向大会赠送锦旗，旗上写着“全世界无产者联合起来！”当执行主席聂荣臻接受这面旗帜的时候，全体代表起立，会场上响起暴风雨般的掌声。
    中共中央委员薄一波着重就在社会主义工业化过程中如何合理地解决积累和消费的关系问题发言。他说，在过去几年间，我们对积累和消费关系的处理，基本上是正确的；积累和消费比例关系的变化，基本上是合乎我国政治经济发展的情况和社会主义工业化的需要的。他认为，在今后若干年内，积累部分在国民收入中的比重，以不低于百分之二十，或是略高一点，较为稳妥。他说，这一比例数字的提出，是根据我国近几年来的经济发展的实践，对于积累和消费关系的几个主要方面进行初步分析的尝试，它只能作为确定正确比例关系的一种参考。薄一波说，正确地解决积累和消费的关系问题，将既可以保证我国工业建设较高速度的发展，又可以保证人民消费水平的逐步提高，使我国人民的生活一年比一年过得好些。
    在今天大会上最后发言的是武汉市妇女联合会主任肖慧纳。她举出生动的事例说明了改善职工生活不能仅仅依靠增加工资和救济来解决问题。必须一方面在发展生产的基础上逐步提高工资、增加福利设施，另一方面还要在群众当中提倡勤俭持家，计划开支。
    大会在下午7时结束。明天，大会将继续举行。
