    In the Chinese Exhibition Hall
    By Zhan Chao, Our Correspondent in Vietnam
    Not far from Hanoi Railway Station, in a square surrounded by green trees, a tall building with a rich Chinese national style appeared not long ago. This is the "People's Republic of China Exhibition Hall."

    Whether viewed during the day or at night, from afar or up close, the exhibition hall resembles a magnificent palace. The emerald green roof, light yellow walls, vermilion door frames, as well as the antique palace lanterns hanging in front of the door, the delicate patterns and caissons cleverly arranged on the lintels and ceilings, and the gold-traced patterns lightly inlaid on the walls, all give a sense of harmony and beauty.

    In front of the exhibition hall's main entrance is a lotus-shaped fountain pool. Walking past it, one first arrives at the bright hall of the exhibition hall. Passing through the hall, one enters the various exhibition areas: heavy industry, light industry, agriculture, water conservancy, daily necessities, handicrafts, medicine, and cultural goods, etc. On display here are more than 3,200 kinds of exhibits, totaling over ten thousand pieces, large and small, as well as models of the Anshan Seamless Steel Tube Factory, and the project of fundamentally harnessing and developing the Yellow River, which specifically illustrate the significant achievements made by the Chinese people in economic construction in the years since liberation.

    According to the comrades responsible for the exhibition hall's preparations, this exhibition is relatively large in scale, and the exhibition hall adopted a demountable wooden structure, so all the components had to be pieced together one by one, which was quite troublesome. However, with the strong support of the government and people of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the construction and display work of the exhibition hall were all completed in just over two months. This exhibition hall is truly a crystallization of Sino-Vietnamese friendship.

    When the exhibition opened on the afternoon of September 3, Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Van Dong, General Secretary of the Vietnam Workers' Party Truong Chinh, heads of Vietnamese agencies and organizations, and foreign diplomats, totaling more than 900 people, all attended the opening ceremony and were the first guests of the exhibition hall. Later, President Ho Chi Minh also took time out of his busy schedule to visit the Chinese Exhibition Hall.

    On September 4, the Chinese Exhibition Hall officially opened. More than 30,000 people came to visit on this day. Among the visitors, in addition to people from all walks of life in Hanoi, many were representatives who came to Hanoi from various places to participate in the National Day celebrations, and many people came specifically to visit the exhibition.

    The exhibition hall is like a very bustling downtown area, with a constant stream of people coming and going from morning to night. Some people hurry from one machine to another to listen to the explanations of the docents, some take a rest after getting tired of watching and then continue to move forward, some go through the exhibition rooms one after another and then re-examine them again, and some are engrossed in copying the Vietnamese instructions of various exhibits.

    An old farmer with a long beard who looked very strong lingered for a long time next to the various new farm implements outside the exhibition hall, and then walked into the exhibition hall. He was extremely interested in everything, and even used his hands to weigh the grain. His name is Uncle Ba, who was originally going home after participating in the "September 2nd" National Day celebrations, but heard that the Chinese Exhibition Hall was about to open, so he decided to stay and see it. Uncle Ba said that he would carefully remember everything in the exhibition hall in his heart so that he could go home and tell his children and grandchildren.

    People can find their favorite parts in the exhibition hall. A fitter, Pham Vi, who lives on Sail Street in Hanoi, lingered in front of the various machines on display in the exhibition hall. He said, "China's technological progress is truly admirable. I really like China's new machines. This part is enough for me to watch for a whole day, and I can only wait until next time to see the other parts."

    The daily necessities section of the exhibition hall also attracts many people, especially women. Young women cherish and gently touch all kinds of printed cloth, and constantly let out "tsk tsk" sounds of praise. Several elderly people wandered around in front of several glass cabinets displaying art and handicrafts, looking at the ivory carving of President Ho Chi Minh visiting the Beihai Nursery in Beijing, then looking at various kinds of woven products, and then looking at the peacock made of velvet flowers, enthusiastically counting the names and numbers of various wild animals on the Hundred Beasts picture. Several young people walked over from the industrial, agricultural, and water conservancy exhibition rooms, talking and laughing loudly as they walked: "We will go back and tell them, and we guarantee they will be extremely surprised."

    The young students were even more excited. Phan Thi Phi Phi, a student in the university's medical department, said enthusiastically: "As I watch, I want to go back and find my friends immediately, to tell them about my warm feelings for China and my firm belief in the brotherly country. Our Vietnam will surely be like today's China, tomorrow's China, and the China of the future."

    In the first six days of the official opening, the number of visitors has reached more than 180,000. And the enthusiasm of visitors to write their thoughts is rare in many exhibition halls, so that the message books are often not enough, and new paper has to be added.

    Many of the thoughts written in the message books are very sincere and moving.

    A naive little girl wrote: "I watched it, everything is beautiful, I don't want to go back. I think: we will also make these machines in the future, Vietnamese factories will definitely make them. I also have a question: Why not exhibit some Chinese children's daily necessities, like toys? I want to buy these toys, can I? Please tell me, Uncle Expert (referring to the staff of the Chinese Exhibition Group). …Phung Thi Bich, elementary school student, Alley 7, Powder Street, Hanoi."

    Ngo Gia Khiem, a national model worker in Vietnamese industry, wrote in his thoughts: "Four years ago, I visited China and saw many factories. Now I am very excited to see the great progress in China's heavy industry. A strong China means a strong peaceful and democratic camp. The forces of peace in Asia and the world will develop and consolidate day by day. Vietnamese industry will follow China's path and strive to catch up with China."

    In the message book, there are also many thoughts written in Chinese. In addition to the words of the overseas Chinese praising the strength and greatness of their motherland, some are also from the pens of Vietnamese friends themselves. For example, there is such a message paper with these lines of Chinese characters written on it:
  "Without the Communist Party, there would be no New China, without the Indochinese Communist Party and the Vietnamese Labor Party, there would be no New Vietnam. I wish Chairman Mao and President Ho good health." The writer is Chen Weihong, a soldier from a certain company in the Red River Right Bank Military Region. (Attached picture)

    在中国展览馆里
    本报驻越南记者　展潮
    离河内火车站不远，一个绿树环抱的广场上，不久前出现了一座富有中国民族风格的、高大的建筑物。这就是“中华人民共和国展览馆”。
    无论是白天或者夜晚，无论是从远处或者近处看去，展览馆都像是一座华丽的宫殿。翠绿色的屋顶，淡黄色的墙壁，朱红色的门框，还有悬挂在门前的古雅的宫灯，巧妙地布置在门楣和天花板上的花纹和藻井，轻轻地浮镶在墙壁上的描金图案等等，都给人以一种和谐、优美的感觉。
    展览馆大门前面是一个荷花形的喷水池，从这里走过去，首先来到展览馆明亮的大厅里。经过大厅，便进入了展览馆的各个展览区：重工业、轻工业、农业、水利、日用品、工艺品、医药和文化用品等等。在这里陈列着三千二百多种、万件以上的大小展览品，以及鞍山无缝钢管厂、根治和开发黄河等模型，具体地说明了中国人民解放后几年来在经济建设上的重大成就。
    据负责展览馆筹备工作的同志说，这次展览规模比较大，而这次展览馆又采取了活动式的木结构，所有构件全得一块块地拼搭起来，相当费事。可是在越南民主共和国政府和人民大力的支持下，展览馆的建馆和陈列工作，只花了两个多月的时间就全部完成了。这个展览馆正是中越友谊的结晶。
    九月三日下午展览会开幕时，越南民主共和国总理范文同，越南劳动党总书记长征，越南各机关、团体负责人以及各国外交使节共九百多人，都参加了开幕仪式，并且作为展览馆的第一批客人。后来，胡志明主席也在百忙中抽空前来参观了中国展览馆。
    9月4日，中国展览馆正式开放了。这一天前来参观的共有三万多人。参观的人们中，除了河内各阶层的人民外，很多是从各地来河内参加国庆典礼的代表，还有许多专程前来参观展览的人们。
    展览馆像是一座非常繁华的闹市，从早到晚不绝地人来人往。有的人急匆匆地从一台机器旁边走到另一台机器旁边去听讲解员的说明，有的人看累了休息一阵再接着往前看，有的人一个展览室挨着一个展览室看过后又重新再看一遍，有的人在聚精会神地抄录各种展览品的越文说明书。
    一位留着长胡子的看起来身体很壮实的老农民，在展览馆外面各种新式农具旁边蹓跶了好久，然后走进展览馆里来。他对所有的东西都感到极大的兴趣，甚至用手去掂掂谷子的斤两。他的名字叫巴大爷，本来参加“九·二”国庆大会后就要回家去的，听说中国展览馆就要开幕了，他决定留下来看。巴大爷说，他要用心把展览馆里的一切都记在心里，好回家去讲给儿孙们听。
    人们在展览馆都可以找到自己最爱好的部分。住在河内帆行街的一个钳工范伟，在展览馆陈列的各式机器前面留连往返，他说：“中国在技术上的进步真叫人钦佩。我非常喜欢中国的新机器，这部分足够我看一整天也看不完，其他部分只好等到下次再来看了。”
    展览馆日用品部分也吸引着许多人，其中以妇女为最多。青年妇女们珍惜地轻轻地抚摸各式花纱布，嘴里不断地发出“啧啧”的赞叹声。几个老年人在陈列美术工艺品的几个玻璃橱前转来转去，一回看看胡志明主席参观北京北海托儿所的象牙雕刻，一回看看各种各样的编织品，一回又去看看绒花做成的孔雀，兴致勃勃地一个个地数算着百兽图上各种野兽的名称和数目。几个青年人从工业和农业、水利部分各展览室走过来，他们一边走一边大声谈笑：“我们回去讲给他们听，保险叫他们惊奇得不得了。”
    青年学生们更是兴奋极了。大学医学系学生潘氏飞飞热情地说：“我一面看，一面想马上回去找我的朋友，告诉他们我对中国亲切的感情，对兄弟国家的坚强信念。我们越南一定也会像今天的中国、明天的中国和将来的中国一样。”
    在正式开放的头六天中，参观者已达到十八万人以上。而参观者写感想的踊跃程度是许多展览馆所少见的，以致留言本经常不够用，得补充新的纸张。
    留言本上许多感想写得十分真挚、动人。
    一位天真烂漫的小姑娘写道：“我看了，什么都好看，不想回去。我想：我们将来也会做这些机器，越南的工厂一定会做的。我还有一个问题：为什么不展览些中国儿童的日常用品，好像玩具一类东西。我想买这些玩具，能吗？请专家伯伯（指中国展览团工作人员）告诉我。……河内粉街巷七号小学生逢氏碧。”
    越南全国工业劳动模范吴嘉嵌写的感想说：“四年前我访问过中国，看了不少工厂，现在看到中国重工业有极大的进步，很兴奋。中国强大就是我们和平民主阵营强大，亚洲和世界和平力量将要一天比一天发展和巩固。越南工业将要走中国的道路并努力赶上中国。”
    留言本上，还有许多用中文书写的感想，其中除华侨写的赞颂自己祖国的强盛和伟大的话以外，也有些是出自越南朋友们自己的手笔的。例如有这样的一张留言纸，上面写这样几行汉字：
  “没有共产党就没有新中国，没有印度支那共产党和越南劳动党就没有新越南。祝毛主席和胡主席健康。”写的人是红河右岸军区某连队的战士陈维红。（附图片）
