  Strong Typhoon Hits Japan and South Korea
    The typhoon on the 8th has already left thousands of residents in Okinawa homeless. Tiles, thatched roofs, and other broken debris were scattered all over the streets. Electric wires were entangled along the roads.
    This strong typhoon struck southern Japan and South Korea again on the evening of the 9th.
    According to incomplete statistics from the Japanese police authorities, a total of thirty people died, one hundred and thirty were injured, and one thousand eight hundred and thirty-five houses were destroyed in Kyushu and twenty-one prefectures in western Japan. More than nine thousand four hundred acres of farmland were destroyed and flooded.
    According to the South Korean police authorities, as a result of the typhoon hitting South Korea, hundreds of houses were washed away, eleven people died, six were injured, and thousands were displaced.
  Guam Chamber of Commerce Opposes Military Rule
    The Guam Chamber of Commerce has lodged a fierce protest against the "security check" system implemented by the U.S. naval authorities on the island. It issued a written statement saying: "The security check system is a culmination of abuse of power and deprivation of human rights," which prevents the free movement of business people. The statement also said: "Under the current naval policy, Guam's economy is completely subordinate to the Navy, and it is almost entirely dependent on military spending."
  U.S. Prisons Overcrowded
    An editorial in the Washington "Star" on September 5 said: "Our prisons are overcrowded." The "Star" said that a warden in Washington said that the reason for the prison overcrowding is that the judiciary is convicting more and more criminals, and the sentences in criminal cases are getting longer and longer. The sentences handed down by the courts have increased from an average of 4 and a half years in 1953 to an average of 6 years and 4 months in 1956, which has affected the turnover rate of prisoners.

  强台风袭击日本和南朝鲜
    8日的台风使成千的冲绳居民已经无家可归。砖瓦、茅草屋顶和其他被吹坏的东西散乱满街。电线沿路缠在一起。
    这次强台风9日晚又袭击日本南部和南朝鲜。
    据日本警察当局的不完全的统计，在九州岛和日本西部的二十一个县里，共有三十人死亡，一百三十人受伤，一千八百三十五幢房屋毁坏。九千四百多英亩的田地被冲坏和淹没。
    据南朝鲜警察当局宣布，台风袭击南朝鲜的结果，几百所房屋被冲走，十一人死亡，六人受伤，数千人流离失所。
  关岛商会反对军事统治
    关岛商会对美国海军当局在这个岛上施行的“安全检查”制度提出了猛烈的抗议。它发表了一个书面声明说：“安全检查制度集滥用职权和剥夺人权的大成”，它阻止了工商界人士的自由往来。声明又说：“在目前海军的政策之下，关岛的经济完全从属于海军，它几乎完完全全依赖军事支出”。
    美国监狱人满为患
    华盛顿“明星报”9月5日的一篇社论说：“我们的监狱人满为患”。“明星报”说，华盛顿的一位监狱长说，监狱人满的原因是司法机关判罪的罪犯愈来愈多，犯罪案件中判刑期限也愈来愈长。法庭所判的刑期已经从1953年的平均4年半增加到1956年的平均6年零4个月，这就影响了罪犯在狱的周转率。　（据新华社讯）
