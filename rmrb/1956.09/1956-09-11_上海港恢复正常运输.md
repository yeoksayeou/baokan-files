Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, September 9th: Shanghai Port, which had once experienced congestion, has resumed normal transportation. Currently, three to four hundred large and small cargo ships enter and leave the port every day. The large quantities of goods that had accumulated on the docks in the previous period have been shipped out successively. On the Huangpu River, one can no longer see ships crowded along the riverbank waiting to be loaded and unloaded.

Since the second quarter of this year, freight volume on ocean, coastal, and Yangtze River routes has increased sharply. In addition, there has been excessive rainfall this year, and the original loading and unloading capacity of Shanghai Port could not meet the needs, resulting in a large number of cargo ships congested in the port with a shortage of workers for loading and unloading. In mid-July, Shanghai Port and relevant units jointly established a dedicated organization, taking measures such as increasing a large number of new stevedores, borrowing a batch of barges and loading and unloading machinery, and improving port loading and unloading scheduling. Loading and unloading workers also launched a quick loading and unloading competition, and the port's daily loading and unloading capacity rapidly increased by 20,000 tons compared to before. In just about a month, port transportation returned to normal.

    上海港恢复正常运输
    新华社上海9日电　曾经一度发生堵塞的上海港已经恢复正常运输。现在，每天进出这个港口的大小货船有三、四百艘，前一时期堆积在码头上的大批货物，已经陆续运出。黄浦江上，也看不到挤在江边待装待卸的船只。
    今年第二季度以来，远洋、沿海和长江航线上的货运量骤然增加，加以今年多雨，上海港原有装卸能力不能适应需要，形成大批货船拥塞港内，没有工人装卸。上海港和有关单位在7月中旬联合成立了一个专门的组织，采取增加大批新的装卸工人、借调了一批驳船和装卸机械并改进港口装卸调度等措施；装卸工人也开展了快装快卸的竞赛，全港每天装卸能力迅速较前提高了二万吨。仅仅一个月左右，港口运输就恢复正常。
