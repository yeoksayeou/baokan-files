    Diligent Management of Household Affairs to Improve the Lives of Workers
    Comrade Xiao Huina's Speech
    Promoting the "Five Goods" movement – "Planning Days Well, Good Unity and Mutual Assistance, Encouraging Workers to Produce Well, Good Hygiene, Good Learning and Education of Children" – is an important task to mobilize workers and their families to improve their lives.
    I fully agree with the various measures proposed in Comrade Zhou Enlai's report regarding improving the material lives of workers. I believe that on the one hand, we must gradually increase wages and increase welfare facilities on the basis of developing production; on the other hand, improving the lives of workers cannot be solved only by increasing wages and relief, but must also promote diligence and thriftiness in managing household affairs and planned spending among the masses. The "Five Goods" movement is an important task to mobilize workers and their families to improve their lives.
    What are the "Five Goods"? It is to mobilize workers' families, under the guidance of socialist ideology, to achieve "Planning Days Well, Good Unity and Mutual Assistance, Encouraging Workers to Produce Well, Good Hygiene, Good Learning and Education of Children." For most workers' families, consciously budgeting carefully and spending according to plan is a very important condition for ensuring a good life.
    This can be illustrated by the following example.
    Zhou Chunjiao is the wife of Liu Ruyi, a porter in Wuhan City's Public Security Street. In the past, she liked to eat well and dress well, and she would buy whatever she liked as soon as she got money. The family of five had a monthly income of sixty-five yuan (an average of thirteen yuan per person), which was never enough. She participated in five "biao huis" (a form of lending) and owed 140 yuan, living a life of "rich for three days and poor for half a month." Because of this, the couple often quarreled. Zhou Chunjiao complained that her husband didn't earn enough money and often asked him to borrow money from the union. She said her husband was a "tobacco pipe, impossible to get along with"; the husband said she was "wearing white shoes to the wedding, the marriage won't last long." Zhou Chunjiao's mother, seeing her daughter's difficulties, deducted money from her son to give to her. Zhou Chunjiao's sister-in-law and mother-in-law had disagreements, and the sisters-in-law ignored each other. This caused Zhou Chunjiao's husband and brother to carry the burden of family problems, which affected their production and work. After receiving the "Five Goods" education, Zhou Chunjiao realized that her lack of planning in life was the main reason for the family's financial difficulties and the couple's quarrels. She decided to implement planned spending, and the family's living situation underwent a significant change. She used forty yuan of her monthly income of sixty-five yuan for necessary family expenses, five yuan for her husband's pocket money, and saved twenty yuan to pay off debts. After eight months, she paid off the 140 yuan debt. In the course of a year, the entire family acquired new clothes, and she even bought her husband a bicycle. With the improvement of family life and family harmony, Liu Ruyi's production enthusiasm was greatly improved, and he transformed from a backward element to an advanced element, and was promoted to deputy foreman in July this year.
    After in-depth "Five Goods" education work, under the influence and leadership of Zhou Chunjiao, her residential group has now become an advanced group in implementing the "Five Goods." The group has a total of twenty-nine households. Before the implementation of the "Five Goods," nineteen households owed a total of 1,160 yuan. After the implementation of the "Five Goods," as a result of planned spending, each household in the group not only paid off their debts, but also acquired clothes and household items worth 1,185 yuan. Family life improved, family disputes decreased, the seven families that used to be discordant became harmonious, and the four notorious old women who used to quarrel in the streets also changed for the better. This "Five Goods" group can proactively help each other whenever someone in the family is sick or has a baby, such as sending patients and women in labor to the hospital, helping them cook, wash clothes, and take care of children.
    This "Five Goods" group, in dealing with workers' production, not only takes care of workers' lives, so that workers do not have to be absent from work due to family affairs, but also helps workers solve certain production and work difficulties. He Ruying originally thought her husband was a roughneck and not good-looking, and the relationship between the couple was not very good; after the implementation of the "Five Goods," she brought food to her husband's workplace every day, so that her husband could have a longer rest after meals. All twenty-nine workers in the group have made greater progress in production and work over the past year, of which twelve workers have received twenty-two awards successively. Some workers said well: "National construction needs a peaceful environment, and we need a harmonious family to do a good job in production." Zhou Chunjiao's husband Liu Ruyi also said correctly: "Before, when we owed debts, we often quarreled when we came home from work, and we didn't gain weight even when we ate meat; now we practice planned spending, the money is enough, and the whole family talks and laughs, and we feel happy even when we eat bean dregs." Now Zhou Chunjiao's group is carrying out a friendly competition of "Challenge to the Factory (mainly to do a good job in the "Five Goods"), Respond to the Home" with the unit where the workers are located, to cooperate with the ongoing advanced producer movement.
    This "Five Goods" group, in terms of hygiene, before the implementation of the "Five Goods," most of them swept only the snow in front of their own doors, and some even didn't bother to sweep their own doors, and threw dirty things in front of other people's doors; now they have established a rotating cleaning system, not only is the family clean, but the environmental hygiene is also good. In terms of learning and educating children, before the implementation of the "Five Goods," only five activists participated in street cultural learning, and most people used the excuses of having many children, being busy with housework, and having financial difficulties to refuse to learn culture; now all twenty-eight literacy targets in the group have participated in cultural learning. They all attach importance to the daily education of their children, educating them not to scold people, not to eat snacks randomly, not to steal other people's things, not to run around on the road, and to protect the trees on both sides of the road. They have basically achieved "housework, work, and study" without neglecting any of them, and thirteen group members have been commended by the street government this year.
    Practical experience proves that promoting the "Five Goods" movement among urban residents and workers' families is an important and effective way to correctly guide the lives of the masses and enable workers to improve their lives under the conditions of their existing wage income. Starting from caring for the lives of the masses, helping the masses overcome difficulties, resolving disputes, and doing a good job in housework, while guiding the masses to raise their awareness and establish socialist ideas and moral customs, this is a good way to mobilize urban working women to serve socialist construction. Therefore, the promotion of the "Five Goods" movement should be regarded as the central content of the work of workers' families. It is also suggested that the party committees and trade unions at all levels in the cities should strengthen their leadership over this work.

### 勤俭持家搞好职工生活  肖慧纳同志的发言

    勤俭持家搞好职工生活
    肖慧纳同志的发言
    推行五好运动——“日子计划好，团结互助好，鼓励职工生产好，卫生好，学习和教育子女好”——是发动职工及其家属搞好生活的一项重要工作。
    我完全同意周恩来同志报告中提出的关于改善职工物质生活问题的各项措施。我认为，我们一方面要在发展生产的基础上逐步提高工资、增加福利设施；另一方面，改善职工生活不是仅只依靠增加工资与救济可以解决的，还必须在群众当中提倡勤俭持家，计划开支。“五好”运动就是发动职工及其家属搞好生活的一项重要工作。
    什么是“五好”呢？就是发动职工家属在社会主义思想的指导下，做到“日子计划好、团结互助好、鼓励职工生产好、卫生好、学习和教育子女好”。对于大多数职工家属来说，自觉地精打细算，有计划地开支，是保证生活好的一个很重要的条件。
    从下述的事例中可以说明这个问题。
    周春姣是武汉市公安街搬运工人刘如意的妻子，她过去好吃好穿，钱一到手就爱啥买啥。一家五口人，每月收入六十五元（平均每人十三元）总不够用，前后“标会”（借贷的一种形式）五个，欠债一百四十元，过的是“富三天、穷半月”的日子。为此，夫妻经常吵架。周春姣埋怨丈夫挣的钱少，时常要他向工会借钱，她说丈夫是“烟袋杆子，不通不得过”；丈夫说她是“穿白鞋子拜堂，夫妻不能久长”，周春姣的母亲见女儿为难，就克扣儿子的钱贴给她，周春姣的弟媳和婆婆闹意见，姑嫂之间更是你不理我，我不理你。这就使周春姣的丈夫和弟弟都背着家庭问题的包袱，影响了生产和工作。周春姣在接受了“五好”教育以后，认识到自己过日子没有计划，是家庭生活困难、夫妻吵架的主要原因，才下决心实行计划开支，于是家庭生活情况有了显著的转变。她把每月六十五元的收入，用四十元作家庭必需的费用，五元给丈夫零用，节省下二十元还债。八个月以后，还清了一百四十元的欠债，并且在一年多的时间里，全家大小添制了新衣，还给丈夫买了一辆脚踏车。家庭生活搞好了，家庭和睦了，刘如意的生产情绪大大提高，由落后分子转变为先进分子，今年七月被提拔为副工段长。
    经过深入的“五好”教育工作，在周春姣的影响和带动下，她所在的居民小组现在已经成为贯彻执行“五好”的先进小组了。该组共二十九户，在执行“五好”以前，有十九户欠债共计一千一百六十元，而执行“五好”以后，由于计划开支的结果，全组各户不仅还清了欠债，并且添制了价值一千一百八十五元的衣服和家庭用具。家庭生活改善了，家庭纠纷减少了，过去七户闹不团结的家庭和睦起来了，四个出名的打街骂巷的老婆婆也改变好了。这个“五好”小组不论谁家有人生病或生小孩，都能主动地互相帮助，例如送病人、产妇去医院、帮助他家烧饭、洗衣服和照顾孩子。
    这个“五好”小组在对待职工生产上，不仅做到了体贴职工的生活，不使职工因家事缺勤，并且能够帮助职工解决某些生产上、工作上的困难。如何玉英原来认为丈夫是大老粗，长得不漂亮，夫妻关系不大好；在推行“五好”以后，她每天把饭送到丈夫工作的地方，使丈夫在饭后能有较长时间的休息。全组二十九个职工，一年以来在生产上和工作上都有了较大的进步，其中有十二个职工先后得到了二十二次奖励，有的职工说得好：“国家建设需要有一个和平环境，我们搞好生产需要有一个和睦的家庭。”周春姣的丈夫刘如意也说得对，他说：“以前欠债，下班回家时常吵闹，就是吃肉也不长肉；现在实行计划开支，钱够用了，一家大小有说有笑，就是吃豆渣心里也痛快”。现在周春姣小组正在与职工所在单位开展“挑战到厂（以搞好“五好”为主），应战回家”的友谊比赛，来配合正在开展着的先进生产者运动。
    这个“五好”小组，在卫生方面，贯彻执行“五好”以前，多半是各人自扫门前雪，有的连自家门口也懒得扫，还把脏东西摔到别人家的门口；现在建立了轮班清扫制度，不但家庭清洁搞得好，环境卫生也搞好了。在学习和教育子女方面，贯彻执行“五好”以前，只有五个积极分子参加了街道文化学习，多数人借口孩子多、家务忙、生活困难等原因，不愿意学文化；现在全组二十八个扫盲对象，都参加了文化学习。他们都重视了对孩子的日常教育，教育孩子不骂人、不乱吃零食、不偷别人的东西、不在马路上乱跑，爱护马路两旁的树木。他们基本上做到了“家务、工作、学习”三不误，今年已经有十三个组员受到了街道政府的表扬。
    实践经验证明：在城市居民和职工家属中，推行“五好”运动是正确地指导群众生活，使职工群众在现有工资收入的条件下改善生活的一个重要的有效的办法。这样从关心群众生活、帮助群众克服困难、解决纠纷、搞好家务入手，而又引导群众提高觉悟，树立社会主义的思想和道德风尚，这是调动城市家庭劳动妇女为社会主义建设服务的一个好办法，因而应当把推行“五好”运动作为职工家属工作的中心内容。并且建议城市中的各级党委和职工会要加强对这一工作的领导。
