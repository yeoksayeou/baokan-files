    Agricultural Cooperative's Rest Days
    Yao Shifu
    Some agricultural cooperatives in Jiangsu Province have already begun to implement a system of rest days, and recently, many members celebrated their holidays for the first time.
    More than 300 agricultural cooperatives in Gaochun County had no rest day system in the past. The members worked in the cooperative from early morning until late at night, so busy they could hardly breathe; some members collapsed in the fields due to overwork; miscarriages and premature births also occurred frequently among female members; some members wanted to spread manure on their private plots, or go to the street to buy oil and matches, but they had no time. With rest days, many of the members' daily life problems can be solved. Members of the Tai'an Agricultural Cooperative in Tai'an Township who lacked pocket money dug up a few loads of vegetables from their private land and sold them on the street, exchanging them for some daily necessities. Members who owned fishing nets could cast a few nets in the lake, catch fish, and exchange them for money to buy oil and rice.
    Agricultural cooperatives in Qingpu County have also successively established a Sunday system. Early on Sunday mornings, male members go to the city or street to buy daily necessities; female members wash clothes and clean their houses at home; young members wear beautiful clothes and rush to appointments; older members gather in shady places to rest and chat.
    Establishing a rest day system is one of the important measures taken by the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee to care for the lives of the masses. In May of this year, the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee, in view of the excessively long agricultural labor time in agricultural cooperatives, which limited the personal activities and the development of sideline and handicraft industries of the members, and also resulted in excessively high labor intensity, instructed all localities to make appropriate arrangements for the time members participate in collective production labor and the time they engage in individual family sideline labor. The method of members resting for half a day every five days can be flexibly imitated in various places.
    The rest day system currently being promoted is diverse. In some places, it is half a day of rest every five days, in some places it is one day of rest every ten days, and in other places it is one day of rest every week or half month.
    Because agricultural production has a strong seasonality, if the rest day system is implemented mechanically regardless of time and conditions, stipulating that there should be one day of rest every five or seven days even during the busy summer harvest and planting seasons and autumn harvest and planting seasons, it would violate the habits and requirements of the farmers. Therefore, during these seasons, some cooperatives appropriately extend the lunch break time, some cooperatives stipulate a system of rotating rest; most cooperatives stipulate that the rest day system will not be adopted temporarily during the busy farming seasons. This makes the rest day system more in line with the production conditions in rural areas and the living habits of farmers, making it easier for farmers to accept, and it is also beneficial to production.
    This new system has been widely supported by the masses of members from the very beginning of its implementation. Many people said, "This is really a good idea to care for the members."

### 农业社的休假日

    农业社的休假日
    姚世夫
    江苏省有一部分农业社已经开始实行休假日制度，最近，不少社员第一次欢度了假日。
    高淳县三百多个农业社，过去都没有休假制度。社员起早搭晚地在社里做活，忙得喘不过气来；有的社员操劳过度，晕倒田中；女社员流产、小产的事故也屡有发生；有的社员想在自留地上浇粪，上街打点油、买匣火柴，都没有时间。有了休假日，就可以解决社员不少日常生活上的问题了。太安乡太安农业社缺少零用的社员，在自用地里铲了几担蔬菜上街卖掉，就换来了一些日用必需品。有鱼网的社员，到湖里撒上几网，捕得了鱼儿，就可以换回油米钱。
    青浦县的农业社，也陆续建立了星期天制度。星期天一早，男社员上城上街去买日用品了；女社员在家里洗衣裳，打扫房舍；青年社员穿着漂亮的衣裳赶赴约会；老年社员都相聚在荫凉的地方歇息谈天。
    建立休假制度，是江苏省党委关心群众生活的重要措施之一。今年5月，江苏省委鉴于农业社农业劳动时间过长，限制了社员个人活动和副业、手工业的发展，并且劳动强度也过高。因此曾经指示各地对社员参加集体生产劳动的时间，和从事个人家庭副业劳动的时间，应作适当安排。社员每五天休假半天的办法，各地可以灵活仿行。
    现在推行的这种休假日制度是多种多样的。有的地方是五天休息半天，有的是十天休息一天，也有的地方一星期或半月休息一天。
    因为农业生产有很强的季节性，如果不分时间、条件，机械地实行休假日制度，在紧张的夏收夏种和秋收秋种等农忙季节，也规定要五天、七天休息一天，那也是违反农民的习惯和要求的。因此，在这些季节，有的社适当延长中午休息的时间，有的社规定了轮流休息的制度；大部分社都规定农忙时节暂不采用休假日制度。这就使得休假日制度比较切合农村的生产情况和农民的生活习惯，较易为农民接受，对生产也有好处。
    这种新的制度一开始实行，就已经普遍地受到了社员群众的拥护。许多人说：“这真是关心社员的好主意。”
