Speaking Up for Drivers and Conductors

I am a cadre of the Beijing Public Transport Company, and I want to speak up for the drivers and conductors of our company. Currently, there are still many people who do not respect drivers and conductors, venting their anger on them at will, and even hitting and scolding them. For example, on the evening of July 29th, during a sudden heavy rainstorm, the drainage capacity of the sewers inside Dongzhimen was small, and the accumulated water almost reached chest height. At that time, nineteen buses of the Municipal Bus Company had their wheels submerged in water, and the engines were soaked and could not be started. In order to get passengers home earlier, the drivers and conductors carried passengers on their backs one by one to shallower water to transfer to other buses. One would think that with such a spirit of service, passengers should not have any complaints. However, one person who was carried out of the water to change buses said with a belly full of complaints: "What are you doing? Why do you want me to change buses? Your technology is too low." Hearing this, they really had no words to express their bitterness.

Recently, there have often been some uncivilized passengers who, anxious to get on the bus, have disputes with the drivers or conductors maintaining order, and as a result, they beat the drivers or conductors. Some comrades have fainted or been injured after being beaten, and were unable to continue working at that time. These immoral behaviors often happen to cadres and workers. I believe that in the socialist construction of today, the work of drivers and conductors is only a different division of labor from the work of others, and it is not inferior. I hope that passengers will respect the work and personality of drivers and conductors.

### 为司机和售票员鸣不平

    为司机和售票员鸣不平
    我是北京市公共汽车公司的干部，我要为我们公司的汽车司机和售票员鸣不平。目前，还有不少的人不尊重司机和售票员，随便向他们发脾气，甚至打骂他们。如7月29日傍晚，在大雷雨的突然袭击下，东直门内的下水道排水量小，积水几乎达到胸部，当时市汽车公司有十九部汽车，被水淹没了车轮，汽车的引擎浸泡在水里，不能再发动了。为了让乘客早些回家，司机、售票员把车上的乘客一个个背向水浅的地方换车，按说：他们这样的服务精神，乘客不该再有所挑剔了。可是，有一位被从水中背过去换车的人，还满腹牢骚的说：“你们这是怎么搞的，为什么要我换车，你们的技术太低了”。他们听了，真是有苦难言。
    最近，常有一些野蛮的乘客，往往急于上车，与维持秩序的司机或售票员发生争执，因而殴打司机或售票员，有些同志被打后昏倒或受伤，当时不能继续工作。这些不道德的行为往往发生在干部和工人的身上。我认为，在建设社会主义的今天，司机和售票员的工作，与其他人的工作只是分工的不同，并非低人一等，希望乘客们尊重司机、售票员的工作和他们的人格。
