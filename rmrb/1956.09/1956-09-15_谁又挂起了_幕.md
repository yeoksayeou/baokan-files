    Who Hung Up the "Curtain" Again

    (I)
    Certain actors in the self-proclaimed "free world" are always shouting at the top of their lungs about the "iron curtain" in the Soviet Union and the "bamboo curtain" in China. Who exactly created these so-called "iron curtain" and "bamboo curtain"?

    Recently, the Chinese government has approved the applications of thirty-one American journalists to come to China for interviews, but the U.S. State Department announced a strict ban on American journalists traveling to China, artificially hindering mutual contact between the people of China and the United States. Following closely, the British authorities in Hong Kong, mimicking the American example, announced that starting September 3rd, under the pretext of so-called "immigration balance," they would restrict the free movement between Hong Kong Chinese residents and mainland compatriots, attempting to hang another "curtain" on the Hong Kong border.

    This practice by the British authorities in Hong Kong is very irrational. It is clearly inconsistent with the current trend of easing international tensions and is also a very unfriendly expression towards the Chinese people. This action not only harms the interests of many Chinese people but also does not help world peace. We firmly protest against this unreasonable behavior of the British authorities in Hong Kong and demand that they promptly revoke this extremely unfriendly measure towards the Chinese people.

    From the news published in major newspapers in the past few days, we have learned that the British authorities in Hong Kong have adopted unreasonable restrictive measures on the entry and exit of Chinese people in Hong Kong. It is also said that since the implementation of this unreasonable measure, in just one and a half days, many angering incidents have occurred at the Shenzhen bridgehead, creating tragic scenes of wives and children being separated from their Hong Kong compatriots. If this unreasonable measure is not canceled as soon as possible, the situation will become even more serious.

    Hong Kong residents have always been inextricably linked with their homeland on the mainland. They have inseparable relationships in terms of life, residence, and work. Now, the Hong Kong authorities are artificially separating many of the relationships between Hong Kong residents and their ancestral homeland with an unreasonable measure, which is inhumane and groundless. We express our extreme indignation at this measure. I believe that this unreasonable measure by the Hong Kong authorities is unfriendly and also inappropriate. From the standpoint of a Chinese worker friendly to the British people, I request the British government to order the Hong Kong authorities to quickly cancel this unreasonable measure and restore the freedom of movement between Hong Kong compatriots and mainland compatriots.

    Due to the implementation of the so-called "immigration balance" method by the British authorities in Hong Kong, a large number of compatriots are stranded on both sides of the Shenzhen bridge. They cannot reunite with their relatives. The Hong Kong authorities' unreasonable measures are an unfriendly demonstration of disregarding the traditional rights of Chinese compatriots to travel to Hong Kong, and it has already caused bad consequences, for which the British authorities in Hong Kong should be fully responsible.

    On the contrary, our government has taken positive measures to facilitate the free movement of Hong Kong compatriots, but the British authorities in Hong Kong have repeatedly taken unfriendly actions. What exactly does the British authorities in Hong Kong use to prove that they "have no intention of being hostile to China"?

    In order to safeguard the traditional rights of Chinese compatriots and for the vital interests of Chinese compatriots, I firmly protest against the unreasonable measures of the Hong Kong authorities.　Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology　Li Zhimin

    谁又挂起了“幕”
    （一）
    自称“自由世界”的某些当事者，总是扯破了嗓子喊“苏联有铁幕”，“中国有竹幕”。所谓“铁幕”和“竹幕”，究竟是谁制造的呢？
    最近中国政府先后批准了三十一名美国记者到中国来采访，可是美国国务院却宣布严禁美国记者到中国来，人为地阻碍中美两国人民之间的相互接触。紧跟着，香港英国当局也学美国的样，宣布从9月3日起，以所谓“出入境平衡”为借口，限制香港中国居民和大陆同胞之间的自由来往，企图在香港边境上又挂上一道“幕”。
    香港英国当局这种作法是很不理智的。这显然和当前渐趋和缓的国际形势不相称，而且也是对中国人民极不友好的表现。这种举动不但损害许多中国人民的利益，对世界和平也没有任何帮助。我们坚决抗议香港英国当局这种无理的行为，并要求它迅速撤销这种对中国人民极不友好的措施。

    从近几天来各大报纸上登载的消息，我们知道了香港英国当局对中国人民出入香港采取了无理的限制措施。又听说自从这项不合理的措施执行以来。仅一天半的功夫，就在深圳桥头出现了许多令人愤怒的事件，造成许多香港同胞妻离子别的惨景。这种不合理的措施，若不早日取消的话；情况还会更加严重。
    香港居民与大陆故乡之间一向是血肉相连的。他们在生活、居住和工作等方面，都有着不可分离的关系。而今香港当局竟以一道无理的措施，人为地把香港居民和祖国故乡间的许多关系隔离开来，这是不通人情与毫无理由的。我们对这种措施表示非常愤慨。我认为，香港当局这种无理措施，是不友好的，同时也是不应当的。我以一个中国工人对英国人民友好的立场出发，要求英国政府责令香港当局，赶快取消这种无理措施，恢复香港同胞和大陆同胞往来自由。

    由于香港英国当局实行所谓“出入境平衡”办法，使得深圳桥两岸滞积了大批同胞。他们不能和亲人们团聚。香港当局的无理措施，是无视中国同胞传统的往来香港的权利的不友好表现，它已经造成了不好的后果，这应当由香港英国当局完全负责。
    相反地我国政府为了便利香港同胞自由往来，采取了积极的措施；可是香港英国当局却一再采取不友好的行动。香港英国当局倒底用什么来证明它“无意敌视中国”呢？
