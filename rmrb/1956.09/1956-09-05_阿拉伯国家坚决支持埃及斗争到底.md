Arab Countries Firmly Support Egypt's Struggle to the End
Arab League Secretary-General Condemns Anglo-French Military Threats

Xinhua News Agency, September 4th, TASS, Cairo, September 4th: Arab League Secretary-General Hassouna, in an interview with the Egyptian newspaper "Al-Ahram," strongly condemned the military preparations being carried out by Britain and France in the Mediterranean region, considering them a threat to peace. Hassouna said: "The concentration of British and French troops on the island of Cyprus cannot create an atmosphere conducive to a peaceful resolution of the Suez Canal issue. Such actions will never intimidate Egypt, nor can they make Egypt and other Arab countries abandon their positions, which are based on the justice and rationality of their cause."

Hassouna pointed out that the Egyptian government fully guarantees the freedom of navigation in the Suez Canal. He also pointed out that Western countries are attempting to sabotage the canal's navigation by recalling British and French pilots, thereby creating a pretext for military intervention. Hassouna said that Western countries' support for the former Suez Canal Company can only damage their relations with Arab countries.

Syrian President States Support for Egypt in All Circumstances

Xinhua News Agency, September 4th, Damascus dispatch: Syrian President Shukri al-Quwatli stated on September 3rd that Syria supports Egypt "in all circumstances."

Speaking at the graduation ceremony of the 1956 graduates of the Syrian Military Academy, al-Quwatli said: "We do not ask for what does not belong to us. We do not ask for the Panama Canal. We are merely advocating resistance to aggression. Since Egypt legitimately nationalized the Suez Canal, the warmongers have engaged in military demonstrations and incited a third world war against the Arab awakening."

Al-Quwatli accused Western countries of "attempting to control our resources and coasts."

He said that the Syrian government intends to strengthen the Syrian army.

Lebanon and Five Other Countries Protest French Provocative Conspiracy

Xinhua News Agency, September 4th, Paris dispatch: The ambassadors of Lebanon, Jordan, Syria, and Saudi Arabia to France, and the acting chargé d'affaires of Iraq to France, visited Egyptian Ambassador Nabi on September 3rd, reaffirming the five countries' support for Egypt's position on nationalizing the Suez Canal Company.

The five countries' envoys to France expressed to Nabi their readiness to submit a statement to the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, protesting against French Foreign Minister Pineau's attempt to sow discord among Arab countries. Pineau, in a speech in Saint-Georges-de-la-Couée, France, on September 2nd, said that "certain Arab countries" considered Egypt's policies too "excessive."

They also told the Egyptian ambassador that they "cannot understand" how Pineau could have such a view, "especially on the Suez Canal issue." Their spokesperson, Syrian Ambassador Mahassad, said: "We assure you that our countries remain and will always remain supportive of you on this issue."

Jordanian Foreign Minister Emphasizes Unity of Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon

Xinhua News Agency, September 4th, Amman dispatch: Jordanian Foreign Minister Hadi said upon returning to Amman from Damascus on September 3rd that Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon believe that due to the Suez Canal dispute and the current situation in the Arab world, it is necessary to unite their ranks.

On the same day, a spokesperson for the Jordanian Royal Palace said that arrangements are currently being made for a meeting of Arab heads of state.

Foreign Minister Hadi, acting on the orders of Jordanian King Hussein, went to Damascus to discuss with Syrian President al-Quwatli the issue of strengthening Arab countries' defense measures.

At a press conference, he said that efforts to promote good relations between Syria and Lebanon were completely successful. He added that he may visit Syria again soon.

Hadi also said that he had conveyed King Hussein's message to the Syrian President, outlining the situation of the recent talks between Lebanese President Chamoun and King Hussein during his visit to Jordan.

A Jordanian civil defense delegation left Amman for Syria on September 3rd to study civil defense prevention measures. The delegation is led by Jordanian Civil Defense Commander Napi Nasser.

A similar delegation visited Egypt last week.

    哈苏纳指出，埃及政府完全保障苏彝士运河的通航自由，他还指出，西方国家企图召回英国和法国的领航员，以此来破坏运河的通航，从而造成军事干涉的借口。哈苏纳说，西方国家支持前苏彝士运河公司只能损害它们同阿拉伯国家的关系。

    他们还告诉埃及大使说，他们“不能理解”比诺怎么能有这样的看法，“特别是在苏彝士运河问题上”。他们的发言人叙利亚大使马哈萨德说：“我们向你保证，我们这几国仍然而且永远在这个问题上支持你们。”

    外交大臣哈迪接受约旦国王侯赛尼的命令到大马士革去和叙利亚总统库阿特利讨论了加强阿拉伯国家的防御措施的问题。
    他在记者招待会上说，促进叙利亚和黎巴嫩的良好关系的努力是完全成功的。他又说，他可能不久再访问叙利亚一次。
