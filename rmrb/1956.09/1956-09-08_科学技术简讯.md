    Science and Technology Briefs
    Reed Combine Harvester
    In the Danube Delta, dense reeds cover over four million hectares of vast land. It is one of Romania's natural resources. But in the past, these reeds were not only not well utilized, but also caused difficulties for river transport and fisheries. Fishermen often had to burn large areas of reeds to facilitate fishing. Now Romania has produced its first reed combine harvester. This machine can not only dredge waterways and build roads in reed-infested areas, but also cut, bundle, and stack the reeds. Reeds are excellent industrial raw materials. Romania will use this abundant raw material to develop its paper industry.
    Tough Synthetic Fiber Cloth
    Czechoslovakia's textile industry has begun producing new synthetic fiber fabrics, including polyamine fibers, polyethylene fibers, etc. These fibers can completely replace flax, cotton, and silk, and some properties even surpass the latter. Polyamine fibers are particularly suitable for producing technical fabrics used as filters in industry. This fabric has been tested as a substitute for woolen fabrics for making belts in cement factories. Polyamine fiber cloth has a service life six times longer than woolen fabrics and has greater toughness in terms of temperature resistance and wear resistance.
    Transplanting Chicken Corneas Restores Sight to the Blind
    An Indian ophthalmologist has successfully transplanted a chicken cornea into a human eye, restoring sight to a 55-year-old man. The patient lost his sight six years ago due to corneal inflammation. He sought treatment at the Charitable Eye Hospital in Calcutta. Dr. Patel, considering it difficult to obtain human corneas, decided to try using a chicken cornea for the surgery. When the bandages were removed two weeks after the surgery, both the doctor and the patient were delighted that the patient's sight had been restored.
    Rubber Roads
    Road surfaces are generally paved with concrete, asphalt, gravel, and sand. But not long ago, foreign magazines published an interesting piece of news: the United States has more than fifty roads, and the United Kingdom has more than sixty roads, that are coated with rubber. This practical application was preceded by successful experiments. Experiments have shown that a mixture of rubber and asphalt can withstand temperature changes well without cracking, and causes much less wear on vehicle tires than ordinary asphalt.

    科学技术简讯
    芦苇联合收割机
    在多瑙河三角洲上，茂密的芦苇覆盖着四百多万公顷的辽阔土地。它是罗马尼亚的天然富源之一。但是在过去，这些芦苇不但得不到很好的利用，反而给河运和渔业造成了困难。渔民为了便于捕鱼，常常不得不把大片的芦苇烧掉。现在罗马尼亚制出了第一部芦苇联合收割机。这种机器不仅可以在芦苇丛生地区疏通河道，修筑道路，还能把芦苇割下来，捆好，垛成堆。芦苇是很好的工业原料。罗马尼亚将利用这种出产丰盛的原料来发展造纸工业。
    坚韧的人造纤维布
    捷克斯洛伐克的纺织工业已开始生产新的综合纤维布，其中包括多氨化纤维、多乙烯纤维等。这些纤维完全能够代替亚麻、棉花和丝，某些性能甚至超过后者。多氨化纤维特别适于生产工业中作滤过器用的技术布。这种布曾代替羊毛织品制成管带在水泥工厂作过试验。多氨化纤维布比羊毛织品的寿命高六倍，在抗温和耐磨方面具有更高的坚韧性。
    移植鸡的角膜使盲人复明
    一位印度眼科医生已经成功地把鸡的角膜移植到人的眼睛中，使一位五十五岁的人恢复了视觉。患者在六年前由于角膜发炎而双目失明。他到加尔各答的慈善眼科医院求医。医生巴特尔鉴于很难得到人的角膜，于是决定试用鸡的角膜来做手术。在动手术两周后解开绷带的时候，医生和患者都因患者复明而感到高兴。
    橡胶马路
    马路路面一般都是用混凝土、地沥青、石子和砂土铺做的。但在不久以前，外国杂志发表了一条有趣的消息：美国有五十多条马路、英国有六十多条马路都用橡胶来涂层。这种实际应用事先经过了成功的实验。实验证明，橡胶和沥青的混合体能够很好地耐受温度的变化而不龟裂，较之普通沥青，对车辆的胶轮的磨损要小得多。
