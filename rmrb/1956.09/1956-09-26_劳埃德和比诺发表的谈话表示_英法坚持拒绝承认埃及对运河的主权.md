Xinhua News Agency, London, September 25th: British Foreign Secretary Lloyd said in a television broadcast on the evening of the 24th that Britain and France submitted the Suez issue to the United Nations to "seek broader support for the plan we have proposed." He added: "We will also support the Users' Association, because we believe that this association will play a useful role in negotiations and dealings with the Egyptian authorities, and also in ensuring that free passage can continue."

Lloyd said that Britain and France's submission of the Suez issue to the United Nations would test whether the United Nations has the power to "ensure compliance with international obligations." He believes that Egypt's nationalization of the canal is a "violation of its international obligations." Lloyd stated that Britain will "do its best" to seek a "peaceful resolution." At the same time, he reiterated that Britain will insist on denying Egypt's sovereignty, believing that the Suez Canal should never be "placed under the unrestricted control of one person."

In his speech, Lloyd also hinted that Britain might use the dams in Uganda to cut off the water source of the White Nile as a way to retaliate against Egypt.

Xinhua News Agency, Paris, September 25th: French Foreign Minister Pineau stated at the opening ceremony of the "High Commission for French Nationals Abroad" on the 24th that "despite diplomatic difficulties," the French government still firmly refuses to recognize Egypt's initiative to nationalize the Suez Canal.

Pineau said that he was surprised to see some French politicians and some newspapers expressing pessimistic remarks about the Suez crisis, because doing so is beneficial to Egyptian President Nasser.

    劳埃德和比诺发表的谈话表示
    英法坚持拒绝承认埃及对运河的主权
    据新华社25日讯　伦敦消息：英国外交大臣劳埃德24日晚上发表电视广播谈话说，英法把苏伊士问题提交联合国是“设法为我们所提出的计划求得更加广泛的赞同”。他又说：“我们还将支持使用国协会，因为我们认为，这个协会将在同埃及当局的谈判中和同它打交道中、同时也在使得自由通行能够继续的工作中起有用的作用。”
    劳埃德说，英法把苏伊士问题提交联合国将考验联合国是否有力量来“保证国际义务的遵守”，他认为埃及把运河收归国有就是“破坏了它所承担的国际义务”。劳埃德表示英国将“尽力”求得“和平解决”，同时，他又重申英国将坚持否认埃及主权的立场，认为苏伊士运河决不应该“置于一个人的不受限制的控制之下”。
    劳埃德在谈话里还暗示英国可能利用在乌干达的水坝来切断尼罗河的水源白尼罗河水流的办法来报复埃及。
    据新华社25日讯　巴黎消息：法国外交部长比诺24日在“法侨高级委员会”会议的开幕式上讲话时表示，“尽管有外交上的困难”，法国政府仍然坚决拒绝承认埃及把苏伊士运河收归国有的主动行动。
    比诺说，他看到某些法国政治家和某些报纸正在对苏伊士危机发表悲观的言论，感到很惊奇，因为这样作是对埃及总统纳赛尔有利的。
