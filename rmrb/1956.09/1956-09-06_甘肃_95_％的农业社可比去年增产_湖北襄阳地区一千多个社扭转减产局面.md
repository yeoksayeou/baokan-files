(Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, September 5th) Most of the agricultural production cooperatives in Gansu Province have completed the trial calculation and distribution of income. The results of the trial calculation and distribution: of the more than 34,500 cooperatives in the province, 95% can increase production compared to last year; 2% of the cooperatives have no increase or decrease; cooperatives with reduced production account for only 3%. Among the agricultural cooperatives with increased production, more than 95% of the members can increase their income compared to last year, and the rest can generally achieve no increase or decrease.

Actively improving agricultural technology in accordance with the time, the cooperatives, and the local conditions, expanding water conservancy construction, increasing the yield per unit area, adhering to diligence and thrift in running the cooperatives, and developing diversified operations are the reasons why Gansu Province can guarantee that 95% of the agricultural cooperatives increase production and more than 95% of the members increase their income this year. By the end of April this year, the province had completed simple water conservancy projects that could irrigate more than 5 million mu of land, greatly expanding the area of ​​paddy fields. In addition to reforms in other farming techniques and relatively even rainfall this year, the province's more than 21 million mu of wheat harvested more than 4.3 billion jin, an increase of more than 1.6 billion jin compared to last year, exceeding the 1957 total output target by 68.27%. At present, autumn crops on most of the land are growing well. This provides a solid foundation for 95% of the cooperatives and more than 95% of the members to increase their income.

In the trial calculation and distribution, all localities have implemented the principle of "less deduction and more distribution," allocating 65% to 70% of the total value of agricultural and sideline production to the members.

In accordance with the principle of "diligence and thrift in running the cooperatives," the expenditure budget was reviewed. After the Xianfeng Agricultural Cooperative in Sanjiao Township, Yuzhong County, checked for waste, it saved more than 172,000 yuan just by using alfalfa as livestock feed and developing fertilizer sources, reducing the purchase of commercial fertilizers. This made it possible to stabilize production costs below 17% of the total production value.

In the trial calculation and distribution, all localities also paid attention to adjusting the labor attendance rate between the teams within the cooperatives to make it roughly balanced. Appropriate work was also arranged for households with the elderly, weak, disabled, widows, widowers, and orphans. This is also an important aspect of ensuring that more than 95% of the members increase their income.

After the trial calculation and distribution of income, the production enthusiasm of the members has been greatly encouraged, and good results have also been achieved in promoting democracy and improving the work of the cooperatives. The labor attendance rate of most cooperatives has increased. The members have also put forward positive opinions on how to implement increased production and guaranteed income in the future.

(Xinhua News Agency) More than a thousand agricultural cooperatives in the Xiangyang area of Hubei Province, which were expected to reduce production compared to last year, have mostly reversed the situation and become cooperatives with increased production.

In mid-July, the Xiangyang Local Committee of the Communist Party of China discovered that among the more than 10,000 agricultural cooperatives in the area, more than 1,100 cooperatives might reduce production. The local committee decided to immediately strengthen leadership over these cooperatives and take emergency measures to reverse the decline in production. The local committee and party and government organs at all levels in the area successively sent more than 1,400 cadres to these cooperatives to carry out work. At the same time, the bank allocated 240,000 yuan in loans and 70,000 yuan in relief funds to provide economic assistance to the cooperatives with reduced production.

After the cadres arrived at these agricultural cooperatives, they mobilized the masses, starting with checking the current production, and formulated plans to strengthen field management and eliminate "backward fields" in areas with the greatest potential for increasing production. For agricultural cooperatives with chaotic labor management, the labor organization was reorganized in conjunction with production, and labor management was improved. After the agricultural production was properly arranged, diversified operations were developed according to the specific conditions of each cooperative to increase sideline income to compensate for the loss of agricultural production. After these efforts, according to a survey of 524 cooperatives with reduced production in four counties, including Sui County, Nanzhang, Fang County, and Yicheng, 236 cooperatives had reversed the decline in production in less than a month.

The Xiangyang Local Committee of the Communist Party of China pointed out in summarizing the previous stage of work that as long as these cooperatives grasp the autumn production, strengthen the late-stage management of autumn crops, and effectively lead diversified operations, the vast majority can be transformed from cooperatives with reduced production to cooperatives with increased production. The local committee believes that the current situation that deserves attention is: some cadres have impatient emotions. Instead of helping and encouraging the cadres and members of these cooperatives to work hard to do the current production work, they are looking for shortcomings everywhere, rectifying cadres, and complaining that the members are "backward." This "pouring cold water" approach not only failed to quickly launch the production campaign, but also reduced the masses' confidence in striving for increased production. In addition, some cadres, after helping these agricultural cooperatives formulate comprehensive production plans, and the production order and the mood of the members have slightly changed, they think that "everything is fine" and are blindly optimistic, and are unwilling to do hard work anymore. In response to these problems, the Xiangyang Local Committee held a telephone conference of the local and county committees to criticize and correct them.

Recently, the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a notice commending the work of the Xiangyang Local Committee and forwarded their practices and experiences to various places for reference.

### 甘肃95％的农业社可比去年增产  湖北襄阳地区一千多个社扭转减产局面

    甘肃95％的农业社可比去年增产
    湖北襄阳地区一千多个社扭转减产局面
    本报兰州5日电　甘肃省大部分农业生产合作社已经完成了收益分配的试算试分。试算试分的结果：全省三万四千五百多个社，有95％能比去年增产；2％的社不增不减；减产的社只占3％。增产的农业社中，95％以上的社员都可以比去年增加收入，其余的一般也能达到不增不减。
    因时、因社、因地制宜地积极改进农业技术、扩大水利建设，提高单位面积产量，坚持勤俭办社，开展多种经营，这是今年甘肃省能够保证95％的农业社增产、95％以上的社员增加收入的原因。今年4月底，全省就完成了可灌溉五百多万亩地的简易水利工程，大大地扩大了水田的面积，加上其他耕作技术上的改革和今年的雨水比较调匀，全省的二千一百多万亩小麦，收获了四十三亿多斤，比去年增产了十六亿多斤，超额68.27％完成了1957年的总产量指标。现在大部分土地上的秋季作物都生长良好。这就使得95％的社、95％以上的社员增加收入有了坚实的基础。
    各地在试算试分中，都贯彻执行了“少扣多分”原则，把农副业生产总值的65％到70％分配给社员。
    根据“勤俭办社”的方针，审查了支出预算。榆中县三角城乡先锋农业社检查了浪费现象以后，仅仅用苜蓿作牲口饲料，以及开辟肥源，减少购买商品肥料两项，就节约了十七万二千多元。做到把生产成本稳定在生产总值的17％以下。
    各地在试算试分中还注意到调整社内各队之间的劳动出勤率，使之大体上平衡。对老弱残废、鳏寡孤独等户，也给安排了适当的工作。这也是保证95％以上的社员增加收入的一个重要方面。
    经过了收益分配的试算试分以后，大大鼓舞了社员的生产积极性，对发扬民主和改进社的工作也收到良好的效果。大部分社的劳动出勤率都有所提高。社员们对今后怎样贯彻增产保收等问题也都提出了积极的意见。（柳梆）
    据新华社讯　湖北省襄阳专区一千多个预计比去年减产的农业社，目前大多数都扭转了减产局面变为增产社了。
    中共襄阳地方委员会在7月中旬发现全区一万多个农业社中，有一千一百多个社可能减产。地委会决定立即对这些社加强领导，采取紧急措施扭转减产局面。地委会和全区各级党政机关先后派出一千四百多名干部，到这些社去进行工作，同时，银行拨出二十四万元贷款和七万元的救济款，在经济上给予减产社以扶助。
    干部们到达这些农业社后，发动群众，从检查当前生产入手，在增产潜力最大的方面，分别订出加强田间管理和消灭“落后田”的计划。对于劳动管理混乱的农业社，结合生产整顿了劳动组织，改进了劳动管理。当妥善安排了农业生产以后，再根据各社的具体条件，因社制宜发展多种经营，增加副业收入，以弥补农业部分减产的损失。经过这些工作以后，据随县、南漳、房县、宜城等四个县五百二十四个减产社调查，不到一个月已经有二百三十六个社扭转了减产局面。
    中共襄阳地委在总结前一段工作中指出，这些社今后只要抓紧秋季生产，加强秋收作物后期管理工作，切实把多种经营领导起来，绝大多数可以由减产社变为增产社。地委认为当前值得注意的情况是：有些干部存在着急躁情绪，他们不是帮助和鼓励这些社的干部和社员，努力作好当前的生产工作，而是到处找缺点、整干部、埋怨社员“落后”，这种“泼冷水”的作法，不仅没有把生产运动迅速发动起来，反而减低了群众争取增产的信心。另有一些干部，在帮助这些农业社定出全面生产规划，社内生产秩序和社员情绪稍有转变的时候，就认为“万事大吉”，盲目乐观，不愿再作艰苦的工作。襄阳地委会针对这些问题，召开地、县委电话会议进行批判，并且作了纠正。
    最近，中共湖北省委员会通报表扬了襄阳地委的这一项工作，并且把他们的作法和经验转发给各地参考。
