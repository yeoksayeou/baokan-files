    New Type of Powered Rice Thresher
    The state-owned Andong County Farm Implement Factory has trial-produced a new type of powered rice thresher, which has been used for two years in the Helong Demonstration Farm in Andong County.
    The basic type of this powered rice thresher is the "nail-tooth spiral double-roller counter-rotating type." Its daily output is 30,000 to 35,000 jin of net rice. The full-load power requirement is 7.5 horsepower to 10 horsepower. The entire operation process requires 20 people. Its biggest feature is that it can completely thresh the "rice tangles" in one go. After re-entering the winnowing machine, the rice can be cleaned, thus eliminating the "beating rice tangles" and "waiting for the wind to winnow" production processes required by ordinary power and foot-operated threshers. Except for manual labor for feeding grass and bagging, other production processes of this thresher are completely replaced by machines.

    新型的水稻动力脱谷机
    地方国营安东县农具厂试制了一台新型的水稻动力脱谷机，在安东县合隆示范农场进行了两年试用。
    这种水稻动力脱谷机的基本型式是：“钉齿螺旋双滚对转式”，它的日产量为净稻三万到三万五千斤，全负荷动力需要七点五马力——十马力，全部操作过程需用二十人，它的最大特点是能将“稻乱子”一次全部脱掉，再入风车后即可将稻子扬净，这样就免去了一般动力和足踏式脱谷机所需要的“打稻乱子”，
  “等风扬场”的生产过程。这种脱谷机除了入送草装袋需要人力外，其他生产过程完全由机器代替。
