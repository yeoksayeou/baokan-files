    Support the Just Struggle of the Egyptian People with All Our Strength
    Editor's Note: Since Premier Zhou Enlai delivered the report on the Suez Canal issue at the 46th meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the newspaper has received a large number of letters from readers across the country. In their letters, readers unanimously supported the solemn stance of our government and expressed their determination to support the just struggle of the Egyptian people with all their strength. Here are excerpts from some of the letters.
    Beijing Wang Qingru and 21 others: Premier Zhou's report expressed our will and spoke what was in our hearts. We fully support this report. We must not turn a deaf ear to the unreasonable behavior of the US, British and French imperialists, and we firmly support the just struggle of the Egyptian people. If the imperialists dare to provoke a war, we are willing to be with the Egyptian people to fight to cut off the claws of imperialism extending to the sacred land of Egypt.
    Tianjin Li Siyuan Si Houzhi: We fully agree with the solemn position taken by Premier Zhou Enlai in his report. We firmly stand on the side of justice, on the side of Egypt, and fully support the just struggle of the Egyptian people. We want to seriously warn the colonialists: the tide of the national independence and liberation movement of the oppressed nations is unstoppable by any force. The just struggle of the Egyptian people is by no means isolated; it has the support of peace-loving and justice-loving people all over the world. If the colonialists dare to launch a war, we are willing to shed our blood on the banks of the Nile for justice and peace when necessary!
    Shanghai Wang Xinyuan, Lin Zhongmei and 7 others: We are future soldiers on the news front, and we understand and are constantly learning how to use news as a weapon to fight against imperialism. However, if the imperialists dare to provoke a war, we are willing to put down our pens and go to Egypt to jointly extinguish the flames of aggression set by imperialism with the Egyptian people.
    Chongqing Miao Yikun, Lü Daren and 30 others: We are a group of young students, and we protest the unreasonable actions of the United States, Britain and France in using force to threaten the Egyptian people. We fully agree with Premier Zhou's report. If the imperialists dare to launch a war, we cannot turn a deaf ear and stand idly by. We are willing to work with the Egyptian people to smash imperialist aggression.
    Wuhan Zhang Fenggeng: Premier Zhou's report exposes the conspiracy of imperialism and expresses the wishes of all Chinese people. In addition to fully supporting this report, I will also do a better job in commercial work to support the just actions of the Egyptian people. If the imperialists dare to disregard the just condemnation of the Egyptian people and peace-loving people around the world and launch a war, I am willing to fight with the Egyptian people to stop the aggression.

    上海　汪新源　林钟美等七人；我们是新闻战线上的未来的战士，我们懂得了并正在不断学习如何运用新闻这一武器向帝国主义进行斗争，但是，如果帝国主义敢于挑起战争，我们就愿意放下笔杆到埃及去，和埃及人民共同扑灭帝国主义所纵起来的侵略火焰。
    重庆　缪以琨、吕达人等三十人：我们是一群青年学生，我们抗议美英法三国用强力来威胁埃及人民的无理行动。我们完全同意周总理的报告。要是帝国主义敢于发动战争，我们就不能置若罔闻，袖手旁观。我们愿意和埃及人民一起为粉碎帝国主义的侵略而努力。
    武汉　张逢庚：周总理的报告，既揭露了帝国主义的阴谋，又表达了全中国人民的心愿。我除了完全拥护这一报告外，并要更好的作好商业工作，以支持埃及人民的正义行动。如果帝国主义胆敢漠视埃及人民和世界和平人士的正义谴责而发动战争，我愿意同埃及人民一起为制止侵略而斗争。
