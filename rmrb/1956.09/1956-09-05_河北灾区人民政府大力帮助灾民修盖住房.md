Xinhua News Agency report: People's governments and agricultural producers' cooperatives in the disaster areas of Hebei Province are vigorously helping cooperative members solve housing problems, stabilize their production morale, and organize them to develop sideline production.

In Handan Prefecture's Daming, Quzhou, and six other counties, after the floodwaters receded, they immediately led the people in the disaster areas to dig up timber and collect bricks and tiles to repair houses. At the same time, they also distributed housing repair subsidies to help disaster victims overcome the economic difficulties of repairing houses. Agricultural producers' cooperatives in the disaster areas also transferred carpenters, bricklayers, and strong laborers to form house-building teams and groups, using free assistance or labor exchange to help cooperative members repair and build houses. As of the end of August, these eight counties had repaired more than 53,000 houses. When repairing and building houses, all localities paid special attention to repairing the houses of revolutionary martyrs' and soldiers' families, as well as those of elderly, infirm, and disabled cooperative members. In Wuqi County, 103 houses of "Five Guarantees" households in various agricultural cooperatives collapsed, and 44 of them have now been repaired. Several houses of revolutionary martyrs' and soldiers' families that collapsed, totaling eight rooms, have also been repaired in a timely manner.

In areas where floodwaters have not yet receded and houses cannot be repaired immediately, the people's governments have also adopted measures such as borrowing houses and building sheds to vigorously resettle disaster victims who are temporarily homeless.

Because this year's floods were too rapid and deep, some villages in the low-lying areas and breach areas of Hebei Province suffered severe house collapses, making the task of repairing houses quite arduous. In addition to taking the above measures to temporarily solve the housing difficulties of disaster victims, people's governments and agricultural producers' cooperatives in various localities have also formulated plans for repairing and building houses. Quzhou County plans to have all the collapsed houses in the county repaired by mid-September.

    河北灾区人民政府大力帮助灾民修盖住房
    据新华社讯　河北省灾区的人民政府和农业生产合作社正大力帮助社员解决住房问题，安定社员生产情绪，组织社员开展副业生产。
    邯郸专区大名、曲周等八县，在洪水退落后即领导灾区人民刨挖木料、搜集砖瓦修补房屋，同时并发放修房补助款，帮助灾民克服修房的经济困难。灾区农业生产合作社也抽调木、瓦工人和强壮劳力，组成盖房队、组，用无偿或换工办法，帮助社员修盖房屋。截至8月底，这八个县共修好房屋五万三千多间。各地在修盖房屋时，特别注意修盖烈、军属和孤老残病社员的房屋。无极县各农业社的“五保”户共倒房一百零三间，现在已修好四十四间，有几户烈、军属倒毁的八间房屋也及时修补好。
    在洪水未落不能立即修盖房屋的地区，人民政府也采取借住、搭棚等办法，大力安置暂时没房住的灾民。
    由于今年洪水过急、过深，河北省低洼地带及决口地区有些村庄房屋倒塌的很厉害，修房任务相当艰巨。各地人民政府和农业生产合作社除采取上述办法暂时解决灾民住房困难外，并订出修盖房屋的计划。曲周县计划在9月中旬便把全县倒塌房屋重新修好。
