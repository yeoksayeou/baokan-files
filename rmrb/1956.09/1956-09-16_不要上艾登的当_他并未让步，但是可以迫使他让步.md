    "Don't Fall for Eden's Tricks"
    --He Hasn't Conceded, But He Can Be Forced To
    This newspaper's London dispatch, 15th: The "Workers' Daily" published an editorial on the 15th entitled "Don't Fall for Eden's Tricks – He Hasn't Conceded, But He Can Be Forced To," saying that Eden has not conceded. Today, another aircraft carrier has departed to join the British fleet in the Mediterranean. If you cherish your peace and future happiness, then by no means be fooled. Eden's trick is to make people believe the assurances he was forced to give reluctantly in the last five minutes of the parliamentary debate on the Suez issue.
    This is not true. His rhetoric has deceived the Labor Party parliamentary group, which has been fighting, and also deceived many newspapers that oppose his hawkish measures. Did he say he now intends to conduct genuine negotiations with Egypt? No. Has he promised that in any case his government will not use force without the special permission of the Security Council? No.
    What he promised was: (1) He would immediately begin organizing an association of user nations. (2) This association will employ all the pilots who withdrew yesterday at midnight. It will pilot ships through the canal and collect fees from shipowners. (3) When the Egyptians say, "Excuse me, you cannot forcibly navigate through like this," Nasser will be accused of aggression and dragged before the Security Council. But a veto may be encountered in the Security Council. In this case, other measures will be taken before submitting to the United Nations—to ensure the rights of user nations. He refused to guarantee recourse to the United Nations before taking these actions.
    He said that perhaps an emergency will occur, requiring shooting first and then investigating. Naturally, this is possible. He will pay attention to this. He has been forced to retreat a few inches from the edge of the cliff. By creating the illusion that he has already conceded, the situation is much more dangerous. We repeat: Eden has not conceded, but he must be forced to concede.

### “不要上艾登的当”——他并未让步，但是可以迫使他让步

    “不要上艾登的当”
    ——他并未让步，但是可以迫使他让步
    本报伦敦15日电　15日“工人日报”发表了以“不要上艾登的当——他并未让步，但是可以迫使他让步”为题的社论说，艾登没有让步。今天又有一艘航空母舰出发加入在地中海的英国舰队。如果你珍视你的和平和未来的幸福，那么千万不要上当。艾登的花招是叫人相信在议会里关于苏彝士问题的辩论的最后五分钟中迫使他勉强作出的保证。
    这不是真实的。他的花言巧语骗住了一直在进行着斗争的工党议会党团，也骗倒了许多那些反对他的好战措施的报纸。难道他说了他现在已打算同埃及进行真正的谈判了吗？没有。难道他允诺过无论如何他的政府不会未经安理会特别许可而使用武力吗？没有。
    他允诺的是：（一）他立即着手组织使用国协会。（二）这个协会将录用所有昨天午夜里撤退的领航员。它将领航船只通过运河，并向船主征收费用。（三）当埃及人说请原谅，你们不能这样强行通航的时候，纳赛尔将被指控为侵略，并将被拉到安理会上去。但是在安理会中可能遇到否决票。在这种情况下，在提交联合国之先将采取其它的措施——以保证使用国的权利。他拒绝保证在采取这些行动之前先诉诸联合国。
    他说也许发生紧急情况，要求先射击然后再调查。自然有这种可能。他将注意及此。他已被迫不得不从崖边上退后数吋。由于造成一种他已经让步了的幻觉，所以形势是要危险得多了。我们再重复一遍：艾登并没有让步，但是必须迫使他让步。
