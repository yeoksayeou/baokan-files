Xinhua News Agency, September 17th: The Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China continued at 2:00 PM on the 17th.

The executive chairmen of today's congress were: Deng Yingchao, Li Fuchun, Lin Feng, Lin Tie, Xu Teli, Xu Xiangqian, Jia Tuofu, Huang Kecheng, and Yang Xiufeng.

Starting today, the congress will begin discussing the Central Committee's political report made by Liu Shaoqi, the report on amending the Party Constitution made by Deng Xiaoping, and the proposal on the Second Five-Year Plan for National Economic Development made by Zhou Enlai.

Dong Biwu, on behalf of the Credentials Committee of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, delivered a report to the congress on the examination of delegates' qualifications. He said that the Credentials Committee had reviewed the qualifications of the 1,026 delegates elected from across the country one by one, and found that the election of all delegates complied with the provisions of the Sixth Plenary Session (Enlarged) of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China regarding the number of delegates and election methods for the Eighth National Congress of the Party.

The congress unanimously adopted Dong Biwu's report.

The first to speak at today's discussion was Zhu De (Secretary of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee). Following him were: Li Jingquan (First Secretary of the CPC Sichuan Provincial Committee), Wang Renzhong (First Secretary of the CPC Hubei Provincial Committee), Bai Zhiming (Secretary of the CPC Yan'an Local Committee in Shaanxi Province), Chen Pixian (Secretary of the CPC Shanghai Municipal Committee), Zhao Chengman (Deputy Chief of the Inspection Section of Dalian 401 Factory, Industrial Labor Model), and Sun Hanzhang (Secretary of the CPC Guiding Local Committee in Guizhou Province). In their speeches, the delegates unanimously endorsed the three reports made by Liu Shaoqi, Deng Xiaoping, and Zhou Enlai, and expressed satisfaction with the work of the Seventh Central Committee over the past eleven years. They used examples from their work to demonstrate the correctness of the Party's line and policies since the Seventh National Congress.

Zhu De pointed out that we possess all the favorable conditions necessary to build a great socialist country. Our country has a vast territory, abundant resources, and a large population. We must fully and rationally utilize our large labor force and semi-labor force to develop our country's rich resources. Zhu De said that we are now in the period of establishing a socialist enterprise. How can we establish our enterprise? We must rely on diligence and thrift. Diligence and thrift are inherent virtues of the Chinese working people. The motto "Diligence and thrift build a family and start a business" should now become a principle that every state worker and economic worker must always keep in mind and implement.

Zhu De spoke about the task of liberating our sacred territory of Taiwan. He said that we will strive to liberate Taiwan through peaceful negotiations, striving to avoid war as much as possible. We hope that the military and political personnel in Taiwan will bravely stand on the position of patriotism and return to the embrace of the motherland. Only in this way will their future be bright. Regardless of the method used, Taiwan must be liberated.

Zhu De continued, "As long as our Party can guarantee the correct leadership of Marxism-Leninism without making major mistakes, and as long as our Party can maintain the Marxist-Leninist consolidation, unity, and solidarity of its own ranks, our Party will surely be able to unite 600 million people and victoriously realize the great task of socialist construction." He called on everyone to further strengthen unity under the principles of Marxism-Leninism and to fight against all factors that are detrimental to the Party's unity and solidarity.

Li Jingquan said in his speech that in recent years, we have been handling the relationship between the interests of the state, production units, and individuals in accordance with the principle of "taking both sides into account and benefiting both public and private" advocated by the Party Central Committee. This has not only allowed individual income to increase year by year, but also enabled the state's accumulation to grow continuously, which is conducive to the country's industrialization. He said that in 1955, the actual total income of farmers in Sichuan Province, estimated at the national constant price, increased by about 12% compared with 1952. In 1956, with the exception of agricultural cooperatives that suffered reduced production due to disasters or had smaller increases in production, it is expected that about 90% of the cooperatives can strive for more than 90% of their members to increase their income. However, Li Jingquan said that there are still some problems in the rural areas of Sichuan Province that need to be resolved, such as the reduction of some sideline productions that must be maintained and developed; the unreasonable prices of some products, which have dampened farmers' enthusiasm for production, etc. In his speech, he put forward suggestions for solving these problems.

Wang Renzhong's speech focused on the leadership system and leadership methods of the Party in industrial enterprises. He said that in the Party organizations in Hubei Province, some comrades once advocated and unilaterally emphasized the implementation of the "one-chief system" in industrial enterprises. Wang Renzhong pointed out that this view has proven to be wrong and inconsistent with the Party's long-standing and effective principle of combining collective leadership with individual responsibility. Some enterprises in the Hubei region, under the influence of this erroneous ideology, have suffered serious losses. Wang Renzhong further cited many enterprise facts to illustrate that in industrial enterprises, whether it is political work or economic work, we must adhere to the principle of combining the Party's collective leadership with individual responsibility, and combining leading cadres with the broad masses. Only in this way can we run enterprises well.

Bai Zhiming introduced the situation in Yan'an and northern Shaanxi, where the people quickly healed the wounds of war and restored and developed production. He said that the per-mu yield of grain this year has more than doubled compared with 1946 before the Kuomintang army attacked. Bai Zhiming said that the Party members and people of Yan'an and northern Shaanxi are determined to do a good job in agricultural production and support industrial construction to celebrate the convening of the Party's Eighth National Congress.

Chen Pixian said that in recent years, the Shanghai Party organization has implemented the central government's policy of relying on the working class to do a good job in production and has restored and developed production. Facts have proved that this policy is completely correct. He introduced the experience of the Shanghai Party organization in implementing this policy.

Next, Li Jishen, Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, delivered a congratulatory speech to the congress on behalf of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, the China Democratic League, the China National Democratic Construction Association, non-party democratic figures from the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the China Association for Promoting Democracy, the Chinese Peasents and Workers Democratic Party, the China Zhi Gong Party, the Jiusan Society, and the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League. At this time, the whole audience stood up and applauded enthusiastically. Li Jishen said that the people's democratic united front, which includes all the democratic parties in China, has played a significant role in China's revolution and national construction under the leadership of the Communist Party of China. He said that our democratic parties are willing to unite continuously with the people of the whole country under the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China for a long time, supervise each other, do our best, and work together to build a great socialist country and safeguard world peace.

At the end of Li Jishen's speech, representatives of the democratic parties and non-party democrats, Li Jishen, Shen Junru, Huang Yanpei, Guo Moruo, Ma Xulun, Zhang Bojun, Chen Qiyou, Xu Deheng, and Xie Xuehong, walked to the rostrum amidst warm applause to present gifts to the congress.

When presenting the gift, Li Jishen said, "We are presenting an ivory carving handicraft that depicts the heroic Red Army victoriously crossing the Dadu River during the 25,000-li Long March." He also said, "We use this gift to symbolize that our democratic parties, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, 'share the same boat' and victoriously transition to a prosperous and happy socialist and communist society."

The executive chairmen of today, Deng Yingchao and Li Fuchun, accepted the gifts. Deng Yingchao thanked the democratic parties and non-party democrats for their congratulations and gifts on behalf of the congress.

During the presentation of the gifts, all the delegates stood up, and the storm of applause lasted for a long time.

After a thirty-minute break, Mikoyan (head of the delegation of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union), Ochab (head of the delegation of the Polish United Workers' Party), Ulbricht (head of the delegation of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany), and Gheorghiu-Dej (head of the delegation of the Romanian Workers' Party) successively addressed the congress.

The delegates stood up and applauded to welcome them at the beginning and end of their speeches.

Following them were Zeng Xisheng (First Secretary of the CPC Anhui Provincial Committee), Li Xian (Director of the Organization Department of the CPC Wenshan Local Committee in Yunnan Province), and Wu Jinghua (Deputy Secretary of the CPC Puge County Committee in Sichuan Province).

Zeng Xisheng said in his speech that thanks to the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee, the people of Anhui Province overcame natural disasters and achieved a major victory in agricultural production. In the seven years since liberation, grain crops have increased by an average of 16.7% per year, more than double that of 1949. This year, despite the severe disasters of drought followed by flooding, wheat diseases, and typhoon attacks, grain crops can still increase by about 9% compared with last year's bumper harvest. In order to better control disasters and develop production in the future, he put forward opinions in his speech such as strengthening flood control work, vigorously supporting agricultural production reform, and taking care of the characteristics of disaster areas in many ways.

Li Xian talked about the experience of various ethnic groups in a township in Wenshan County, Yunnan, jointly running cooperatives. Wu Jinghua talked about the issue of the Yi people in the Liangshan area of Sichuan Province directly transitioning to socialism after abolishing the slave system.

Today's congress ended at 7:00 PM and will continue tomorrow.

    中共第八次全国代表大会开始讨论
    民主党派和无党派民主人士的代表致祝词  苏、波、德、罗等国兄弟党的代表向大会致词
    据新华社17日讯　中国共产党第八次全国代表大会17日下午2时继续举行。
    今天大会的执行主席是：邓颖超、李富春、林枫、林铁、徐特立、徐向前、贾拓夫、黄克诚、杨秀峰。
    代表大会从今天起开始讨论刘少奇所作的中央委员会的政治报告、邓小平所作的关于修改党的章程的报告和周恩来所作的关于发展国民经济的第二个五年计划的建议的报告。
    董必武代表中国共产党第八次全国代表大会代表资格审查委员会向大会作了关于代表资格的审查报告。他说，代表大会代表资格审查委员会对全国选出的一、○二六名代表资格逐个地进行审查的结果，认为所有代表的选举都符合中国共产党第七届六中全会（扩大）关于党的第八次全国代表大会代表名额和选举办法的规定。
    大会一致通过了董必武的报告。
    今天在大会讨论时首先发言的是朱德（中共中央书记处书记）。接着发言的有：李井泉（中共四川省委员会第一书记）、王任重（中共湖北省委员会第一书记）、白志明（中共陕西省延安地方委员会书记）、陈丕显（中共上海市委员会书记）、赵成满（大连四○一厂检查科副科长、工业劳动模范）、孙汉章（中共贵州省贵定地方委员会书记）。代表们在发言中一致拥护刘少奇、邓小平、周恩来所作的三个报告，并对第七届中央委员会十一年来的工作表示满意。他们以工作中的实例证明了七次代表大会以来党的路线和政策的正确性。
    朱德指出，我们具备着为建成伟大的社会主义国家所必需的一切有利的条件。我国地大物博和人口众多。我们要充分地合理地利用我国众多的劳动力和半劳动力去开发我国的丰富资源。朱德说，我们正处在创立社会主义的家业的时期。我们要怎样才能把我们的家业创立起来呢？要靠勤劳，还要靠节俭。勤俭是我国劳动人民固有的美德。“克勤克俭，成家立业”的格言，现在应当成为我们每一个国家工作人员和经济工作人员必须时刻牢记和贯彻执行的原则。
    朱德在发言中谈到我们面前还有解放我国的神圣领土台湾的任务。他说，我们将争取用和平谈判的方式，尽可能地争取不用战争的方式解放台湾。希望台湾的军政人员勇敢地站到爱国主义的立场上来，回到祖国的怀抱中来。只要这样，他们的前途就是光明的。不管是用什么方式，台湾是一定要解放的。
    朱德接着说，只要我们党能够保证马克思列宁主义的正确领导而不犯重大的错误，只要我们党能够保持自己队伍本身的马克思列宁主义的巩固的统一和团结，我们党就一定能够团结六亿人民胜利地实现社会主义建设的伟大任务。他号召大家在马克思列宁主义的原则下进一步加强团结，并且向一切不利于党的统一和团结的因素作斗争。
    李井泉在发言中说，几年来，我们在处理国家、生产单位和个人利益的关系上，是按照党中央历来主张的“双方兼顾、公私两利”的分配原则执行的。这既使个人的收益逐年有所增加，也能够使国家的积累得以不断增长，而有利于国家的工业化。他说，1955年四川全省农民的实际总收入，按全国不变价格估算，比1952年约增加12％左右。1956年，除因灾减产和增产较少的农业合作社以外，预计90％左右的合作社可以争取90％以上的社员增加收入。但是李井泉说，目前四川省农村中有些问题还需要解决，如若干必须加以保持和发展的副业生产减少了；有些产品的价格不合理，打击了农民的生产情绪等等。他在发言中提出了解决这些问题的建议。
    王任重的发言，着重就党在工业企业中的领导制度和领导方法问题发表了意见。他说，在湖北省的党组织中，曾经有一些同志主张和片面强调在工业企业中实行“一长制”。王任重指出，这种主张，事实证明是错误的，是同党多年来行之有效的集体领导和个人负责相结合的原则不相符合的。湖北地区有些企业，在这种错误思想的影响下，曾经造成了严重的损失。王任重进一步举出许多企业的事实说明，在工业企业中，无论是政治工作或经济工作，都必须坚持党的集体领导与个人负责相结合，领导骨干与广大群众相结合的原则，只有这样才能把企业办好。
    白志明在发言中介绍了延安和陕北人民迅速医治好战争创伤，恢复和发展了生产的状况。他说今年粮食亩产量比国民党军进攻之前的1946年增加了一倍以上。白志明说，延安和陕北的党员和人民，决心搞好农业生产，支援工业建设，来庆祝党的第八次代表大会的召开。
    陈丕显说，几年来，上海的党组织执行中央规定的依靠工人阶级搞好生产的方针，恢复和发展了生产。事实证明，这个方针是完全正确的。他介绍了上海党组织执行这个方针的经验。
    接着，中国国民党革命委员会主席李济深代表中国国民党革命委员会、中国民主同盟、中国民主建国会、中国人民政治协商会议无党派民主人士、中国民主促进会、中国农工民主党、中国致公党、九三学社、台湾民主自治同盟向大会致祝词。这时，全场起立，热烈鼓掌。李济深说，包含中国各民主党派的人民民主统一战线，在中国共产党领导下，对中国革命和国家建设事业发挥了显著的作用。他说，我们各民主党派愿意长远在中国共产党的正确领导下，和全国人民一道不断地加强团结，相互督促，各尽所能，为建成伟大的社会主义国家和维护世界和平而共同努力。
    李济深在致词结束时，各民主党派和无党派民主人士的代表李济深、沈钧儒、黄炎培、郭沫若、马叙伦、章伯钧、陈其尤、许德珩、谢雪红等在热烈的掌声中走到主席台前，向大会献礼品。
    李济深在献礼时说，我们献的是一件象牙雕刻的工艺品，雕刻的是在二万五千里长征中红军英雄胜利渡过大渡河。他又说，我们用这件礼品来象征我们各民主党派在中国共产党领导下，“同舟共济”，胜利地过渡到繁荣幸福的社会主义和共产主义社会。
    今天的执行主席邓颖超、李富春接受了礼品。邓颖超代表大会感谢各民主党派和无党派民主人士的祝贺和赠礼。
    在献礼的时候，代表们全体起立，暴风雨般的掌声经久不息。
    在休息三十分钟后，米高扬（苏联共产党代表团团长）、奥哈布（波兰统一工人党代表团团长）、乌布利希（德国统一社会党代表团团长）、乔治乌—德治（罗马尼亚工人党代表团团长）相继向代表大会致词。
  （全文见第四、五、六版）
    到会代表在他们致词开始和结束的时候，都起立鼓掌表示欢迎。
    接着发言的有曾希圣（中共安徽省委员会第一书记）、李铣（中共云南省文山地方委员会组织部长）、伍精华（中共四川省普格县委员会副书记）。
    曾希圣在发言中说，由于党中央的正确领导，安徽省人民战胜自然灾害，取得了农业增产的重大胜利。在解放后的七年中，粮食作物平均每年递增16.7％，比1949年增产一倍以上。今年在先旱后涝、麦子遭受病害和受台风袭击的严重灾害情况下，粮食作物仍可比去年的丰收年成增产约9％左右。为了今后更好地制服灾害和发展生产，他在发言中提出了加强治涝工作、大力支持农业生产改革、多方面关照灾区的特点等的意见。
    李铣谈到了云南文山县民族杂居的一个乡的各民族联合办合作社的经验。伍精华谈到了四川省凉山地区彝族在废除奴隶制度后直接过渡到社会主义的问题。
    今天的大会在下午7时结束，明日继续开会。
