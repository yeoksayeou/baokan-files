Xinhua News Agency, September 3rd: Procuratorial correspondents of the People's Procuratorates have recently seen great development. According to statistics from the Supreme People's Procuratorate, there are now more than 94,000 procuratorial correspondents nationwide.

The procuratorial correspondents in various localities have played a significant role in assisting the procuratorial organs in the struggle against illegal and criminal elements, exposing many counter-revolutionary and embezzlement and theft cases and illegal incidents, and effectively and promptly striking blows against illegal and criminal elements who endanger the cause of socialist construction and socialist transformation. Zhang Zhihong, a procuratorial correspondent in Sawu Township, Gao Ping County, Shanxi Province, discovered that Li Tingyu, a hidden counter-revolutionary element, had worked in the Kuomintang government in the past and had killed nine farmers. After learning of this situation, he conducted an investigation, found reliable evidence, and reported it to the procuratorial organ in a timely manner. The procuratorial organ investigated and verified the facts and immediately arrested Li Tingyu. When Zhang Zhihong established a primary agricultural production cooperative in the village, he discovered that three counter-revolutionary elements were meeting secretly. After obtaining this clue, he spent a month and a half investigating the criminal facts of the three counter-revolutionary elements. He promptly submitted a written report to the procuratorial organ on the materials he had investigated regarding the three counter-revolutionary elements sabotaging the cooperative and spreading rumors. These counter-revolutionary elements have now also been arrested. The masses in the village all applauded. Ma Chengbing, a procuratorial correspondent in Gaolin Township, Xingyang County, Henan Province, reported the criminal facts of Deng Quanbao, the security chief of the agricultural cooperative, who abused his power to embezzle more than 260 jin of grain from the cooperative members. After the county People's Procuratorate investigated and verified the facts, it immediately suggested that the relevant departments handle the matter and recover the embezzled grain. Some procuratorial correspondents resolutely stood firm and struggled against illegal and criminal elements. For example, Long Rencai, a procuratorial correspondent in Heshi Township, Da County, Sichuan Province, reported the criminal facts of his own younger brother, Long Rendi, who stole 350 jin of wheat and 21 jin of cotton from the state. After the county People's Procuratorate investigated and verified the facts, it immediately prosecuted this theft case to the People's Court. During the trial of the case in court, procuratorial correspondent Long Rencai also appeared in court to testify and personally confirmed the crimes of the criminal element.

Because procuratorial correspondents are more familiar with the situation in their units and regions and have close ties with the masses, they have also played a good role in assisting the procuratorial organs in understanding the facts of cases. When the Dongguang County People's Procuratorate investigated the embezzlement case of Zhao Liankui, the civil affairs commissioner of Chengguan Town, Dongguang County, Niu Yongzhen, the procuratorial correspondent of Chengguan Town, actively assisted in collecting materials, enabling the investigators of the People's Procuratorate to clarify the facts of the case within two days. When the Nanjing Municipal People's Procuratorate inspected a liability accident that occurred in a state-owned factory in Nanjing, the procuratorial correspondent of the factory not only introduced the case in detail, but also helped the procuratorial organ to understand the more complicated technical issues such as technical operating procedures and machine equipment and performance from the relevant technical personnel, which greatly helped to quickly clarify the facts of the case.

The procuratorial correspondents in various localities also often use typical cases to publicize national laws and decrees to the broad masses, educate the masses to abide by the law, or cooperate with the central work of the local areas during various periods to publicize the state's policies to the masses. Through their publicity activities, the masses' concept of abiding by the law has been enhanced.

    全国检察通讯员达九万四千多名
    同违法犯罪分子作斗争起了很大作用
    新华社3日讯　人民检察机关的检察通讯员近来有了很大的发展。据最高人民检察院的统计，全国现有检察通讯员九万四千多名。
    各地的检察通讯员在协助检察机关和违法犯罪分子作斗争起了很大的作用，揭发了许多反革命、贪污盗窃案件和违法事件，及时有效地打击了危害社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的违法犯罪分子。山西省高平县洒务乡检察通讯员张志宏发现暗藏的反革命分子李廷玉过去在国民党政府里做过事，并曾杀害农民九人。他得到这个情况后，便进行调查，找到了可靠证据，及时报告给检察机关。检察机关侦查属实，即将李廷玉逮捕。张志宏在村里建立初级农业生产合作社时，发现三个反革命分子在暗地开会。他得到这个线索后，便花了一个半月的时间去调查三个反革命分子的犯罪事实。他把所调查到的三个反革命分子破坏合作社和散布谣言等材料，及时向检察机关作了书面报告。现在这些反革命分子也被逮捕起来。村内群众都拍手称快。河南省荥阳县高林乡检察通讯员马成斌检举了农业社保卫股长邓全保利用职权贪污社员粮食二百六十多斤的犯罪事实。县人民检察院调查属实后，即建议有关部门进行了处理，并追回了贪污的粮食。有的检察通讯员坚决站稳立场，向违法犯罪分子作斗争。如四川省达县河市乡检察通讯员龙仁才检举了他的亲弟弟龙仁弟盗窃国家小麦三百五十斤、棉花二十一斤的犯罪事实。县人民检察院侦查属实后，即把这个盗窃案件向人民法院起诉。在法院审理案件时，检察通讯员龙仁才又出庭作证，当面证实了犯罪分子的罪行。
    由于检察通讯员对所在单位和地区的情况比较熟悉，并与群众有密切联系，因此在协助检察机关了解案情方面也起了良好的作用。河北省东光县人民检察院侦查东光县城关镇民政委员赵连奎贪污案时，城关镇检察通讯员牛永珍积极协助搜集材料，使人民检察机关的侦查人员在两天内弄清了案情。南京市人民检察院检查南京市一个国营工厂所发生的责任事故时，这个厂的检察通讯员不仅详细地介绍了案情，并帮助检察机关向有关的技术人员了解关于技术操作规程和机器设备、性能等较为复杂的技术问题，对迅速弄清案情帮助很大。
    各地检察通讯员还经常用典型案件，向广大群众宣传国家法律、法令，教育群众守法，或配合当地各个时期的中心工作，向群众宣传国家的政策。通过他们的宣传活动，提高了群众的守法观念。
