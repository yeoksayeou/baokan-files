Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, September 14th: Antara News Agency reported that Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo told reporters on September 13th that his government still believes that the intention of threatening with force must be abandoned when resolving the Suez Canal issue. The Prime Minister recalled that the Indonesian government had requested friendly countries such as Britain, France, and the United States to halt military preparations. Today's "Independence Daily" also quoted the Prime Minister as saying that due to the development of the situation in the Suez Canal area, Indonesia believes it has reason to express concern and insist on its consistent attitude of resolving this issue through peaceful means. Indonesia hopes that negotiations, rather than the use of force, will be employed in resolving this issue. He added that a possible war would not be a local war and could therefore lead to infinite danger.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, September 14th: Indonesian Minister of Information Sudibjo said today that if a war breaks out due to the Suez Canal crisis, such a war would be a colonial war for which Britain should be responsible.

He told the press: "The Suez Canal issue currently appears to be becoming serious." He said that all of Britain's actions are merely attempts to save its prestige, and Britain has repeatedly made threats to Egypt.

He hoped that the British people, having experienced the disasters of World War II, would refuse to risk any danger that would cause a new world war.

Sudibjo said that his government still hopes that the canal issue can be resolved through peaceful means.

Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Mononutu said today that the so-called "Canal Users' Association" initiated by Britain, France, and the United States will bring more difficulties to the work of seeking a solution through negotiations. Mononutu quoted Prime Minister Nehru's remarks yesterday, saying that this approach by Western countries is a coercive solution that will bring about disputes with serious consequences.

Commenting on Egypt's proposal to establish a negotiating body to resolve the canal dispute, Mononutu said that at this critical juncture, "we must seriously consider Egypt's proposal because it offers the possibility of a peaceful solution."

Mononutu emphasized that he was expressing his personal opinion.

    印度尼西亚反对西方扩大运河问题的争端
    沙斯特罗阿米佐约要求美英法不使用武力
    新华社雅加达14日电　安塔拉通讯社报道说，沙斯特罗阿米佐约总理9月13日对记者说，他的政府仍然认为，在解决苏彝士运河问题的时候，必须放弃以武力施威胁的意图。这位总理追述说，印度尼西亚政府曾经要求英国、法国和美国这些友好国家停止军事准备。今天的“独立报”还援引这位总理的话说，由于苏彝士运河地区的局势的发展，印度尼西亚认为它有理由表示关怀和坚持它素来主张的用和平方法解决这个问题的态度。印度尼西亚希望，在解决这个问题的时候要用谈判方法而不是采用武力。他又说，可能发生的战争不会是一场局部的战争，因而可能导致无限的危险。
    新华社雅加达14日电　印度尼西亚情报部长苏迪比约今天说，如果由于苏彝士运河危机而爆发战争，这种战争就是应该由英国负责的殖民战争。
    他对报界说：“苏彝士运河问题目前看来正趋于严重。”他说，英国所有的行动仅仅是企图挽回它的威信，英国已经屡次对埃及提出了恫吓。
    他希望英国人民在经受了第二次世界大战的灾难以后，将拒绝冒任何引起新的世界大战的危险。
    苏迪比约说，他的政府仍旧希望运河问题能够通过和平道路来解决。
    印度尼西亚外交部发言人莫诺努图今天说，英国、法国和美国发起的所谓“运河使用国协会”将为通过谈判寻求解决的工作带来更多的困难。莫诺努图引用尼赫鲁总理昨天的谈话说，西方国家的这种做法是一种强制的解决办法，将带来有严重后果的争端。
    莫诺努图在评论埃及所提出的关于成立谈判机构来解决运河争端的建议的时候说，在目前这个严重关头，“我们必须认真地考虑埃及的这个建议，因为它提供了和平解决的可能性。”
    莫诺努图强调说，他这是表示他个人的意见。
