Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 31st - The Anhui Province state-owned commercial system's implementation of centralized commodity transportation has shown many benefits over the past four months.
    This method allows for rapid allocation of transportation vehicles, shortening the time for commodity dispatch. In the past, when various state-owned companies transported goods separately, the cargo often fell below the vessel's load capacity, and it was necessary to wait for the ship to be fully loaded before it could set sail, delaying each shipment by at least two to three days. Now, centralized transportation can solve this contradiction. Adopting this method also allows for mutual adjustment and use of transportation vehicles, avoiding the past phenomenon of having goods but no vehicles or ships, or having vehicles or ships but no goods. At the same time, it can also save manpower and transportation costs.
    Centrally managing commodity transportation is a complex task. When the Anhui Province state-owned commercial departments initially implemented this, they lacked experience and the scope was too broad. Later, they did not strengthen leadership, so there were still occasional instances of misdelivery and delayed delivery. Now, the commercial departments are summarizing their experiences to make this method more perfect.

### 安徽省国营商业系统集中办理商品运输

    安徽省国营商业系统集中办理商品运输
    新华社合肥31日电　安徽省国营商业系统实行集中办理商品运输的办法，四个月来已经显示出很多好处。
    这种办法使交通工具调配迅速，缩短了商品发运时间。过去各国营公司分散运输的时候，所运货物常常低于船舶载重量，必需等候船只满载后才能启运，这样每一次最少要迟运两三天。现在集中运输就能解决了这一矛盾。采用这个办法，还可以相互调剂使用运输工具，避免过去那种有货物无车船或有车船无货物的现象，同时还可以节省人力和运输费用。
    集中办理商品运输是一项复杂的工作。安徽省国营商业部门在开始实行的时候，因为缺乏经验，范围搞得过大，以后又没有加强领导，因此有时仍有错运、迟运等现象。现在商业部门正在总结经验，使这一办法更趋完善。
