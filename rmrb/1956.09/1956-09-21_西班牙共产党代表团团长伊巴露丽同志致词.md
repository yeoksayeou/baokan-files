Comrades, friends:

On behalf of the Spanish Communist Party and the Central Committee, I extend my heartfelt congratulations to your Congress. Through you, representatives, I extend my respects to the great Chinese people, who, under the leadership of the Communist Party, have victoriously built China into a strong socialist industrial power.

In this brief congratulatory message, I would like to express my deep gratitude to the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party for enabling us to participate in this momentous Congress, which will greatly contribute to the entire workers' movement and socialist movement engaged in the struggle for social justice and socialism.

The Spanish people and the Chinese people are strategically located at the two ends of the Eurasian continent.

The Chinese people are in the East, and the Spanish people are in the West.

We are thousands of kilometers apart; however, the vast distance does not prevent the Chinese Communist Party and the Spanish Communist Party, the Spanish people and the Chinese people, from sharing common interests, common aspirations, and common ideas. These commonalities eliminate geographical barriers and shorten the distance between us.

Marxism-Leninism unites all of us. The Communist parties of all countries, under the banner of Marxism-Leninism, seek the path to socialism, which is the inevitable path of socio-historical development, based on the characteristics of their own countries.

During a heroic and glorious stage of our history, the Chinese people's struggle against Japanese imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek, and the Spanish people's struggle against Franco and the Italian and German fascist armies, occurred simultaneously.

Songs about the Spanish War were sung in the ranks of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and in the battles of Madrid, our soldiers passionately watched the actions and every victory of the glorious Chinese People's Army, celebrating these victories as if they were their own.

Today, China is laying the foundations of a socialist society, while the Spanish people continue their anti-fascist struggle, their struggle for Spanish democracy. We are confident that in the near future, celebratory rallies will also be held in our streets.

Everything that China is building, everything that China has achieved, especially your Eighth Party Congress—which firmly and convincingly pointed out the effectiveness and necessity of the alliance between the proletariat and the peasantry, as well as the national bourgeoisie, in the struggle for democracy and socialism—will greatly assist our efforts and struggles for the development of our country's bourgeois democratic revolution and the struggle against General Franco's dictatorial government.

Because you have not only elucidated the necessity of this alliance in a Leninist manner, but also confirmed in practice that this alliance is achievable, that social transformation will not cut off the path to survival for those members of the bourgeoisie loyal to the motherland, and that they can play a significant role alongside the people in the great social transformations required by socio-historical development.

This is the enormous assistance that the Chinese Communist Party has given to the cause of peace, to the workers' movement, and to the Communist parties and bourgeois democratic forces of all countries. This help enables them, when observing major national issues, to proceed not from subjective personal viewpoints, but from the overall interests of the socialist cause and the progress of the peoples of all countries.

The 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union elucidated the possibility of a peaceful transition to socialism, which has opened up extremely broad avenues for the unity of the working class and the alliance of workers, peasants, and bourgeois democratic forces.

You, the comrades of the Chinese Communist Party, at your Congress, have used your experience to show us how this possibility can be realized. You have pointed out not only to the working class, but also to the bourgeoisie, a new path of peaceful development. This path enables the peoples of all countries to avoid the fratricide and suffering that were inevitably destined in the past.

In deeply thanking you for your struggles, your sacrifices, your efforts, and your assistance, I assure you, comrades of the Chinese Communist Party, that the Spanish Communist Party, based on your experience, the experience of the great Soviet Communist Party, and the experience of the entire world communist movement, will strive to forge all of our country's national forces into a solid front of democratic progress. This national force shares common interests with the people's welfare and national prosperity in our country's struggle for peaceful democracy and socialism.

Long live the Eighth Congress of the Chinese Communist Party!

Long live peace and the friendship of the peoples of all countries!

    西班牙共产党代表团团长伊巴露丽同志致词同志们，朋友们：
    我代表西班牙共产党和中央委员会向你们的代表大会致以衷心的祝贺，并通过各位代表同志向在共产党领导下胜利地把中国建设成为社会主义工业强国的伟大的中国人民致敬。
    在这个简短的贺词中，我要向中国共产党中央委员会表示深切的感谢，感谢它使我们能够参加这个意义重大的代表大会。这个大会将大大地有助于为争取社会正义和社会主义而从事斗争的整个工人运动和社会主义运动。
    西班牙人民和中国人民在战略上处在亚欧两洲的两端。
    中国人民在东方，西班牙人民在西方。
    我们相距数千公里；但是遥远的距离并不妨碍中国共产党和西班牙共产党之间，西班牙人民和中国人民之间具有共同的利益、共同的抱负和共同的思想。这些共同点消除了地理上的隔阂，缩短了我们之间的距离。
    马克思列宁主义把我们所有的人联合在一起。各国的共产党，在马克思列宁主义的旗帜下，根据本国的特点，寻找通向社会历史发展必然要走的社会主义道路。
    在我们历史的一个英勇而光荣的阶段里，同时发生了中国人民反对日本帝国主义、反对蒋介石的斗争和西班牙人民反对佛朗哥、反对意大利、德国法西斯军队的斗争。
    在中国解放军的部队里唱着有关西班牙战争的歌曲，在马德里的战斗里我们的战士满腔热情地注视着光荣的中国人民军队的行动和他们的每一个胜利，我们战士庆祝这些胜利就像自己的胜利一样。
    今天中国正在奠定社会主义社会的基础，而西班牙人民还继续着反法西斯主义的斗争，继续着争取西班牙民主的斗争。我们确信在不久的将来，我们的街道上也将要举行庆祝大会。
    中国所建设的一切，中国所实现的一切，特别是你们的第八次党代表大会——在会上坚定而令人信服地指出了在争取民主和社会主义的斗争中无产阶级和农民以及民族资产阶级联盟的成效和必要性，——这一切对于我们为我国资产阶级民主革命的发展所作的努力和斗争，对于反对佛朗哥将军的独裁政府的斗争，将有非常大的帮助。
    因为你们不仅以列宁主义的态度阐明了这个联盟的必要性，而且在实践中证实了这个联盟是可以实现的，证实了社会的改造并不会断绝那些忠于祖国的资产阶级的生路，证实了他们在社会历史发展所要求的伟大社会改造中可以和人民在一起发挥很大的作用。
    这就是中国共产党对于和平事业，对于工人运动，对于全世界各国的共产党和资产阶级的民主力量所给予的巨大帮助，这个帮助使他们在观察重大的民族问题的时候，不是从主观的个人观点出发，而是从社会主义事业和各国人民进步的整体利益出发。
    苏联共产党第二十次代表大会阐明了和平过渡到社会主义的可能性，这就为工人阶级的团结以及工人、农民和资产阶级民主力量的联盟开辟了极为广阔的道路。
    你们，中国共产党的同志们，在代表大会上用你们的经验给我们指明了这个可能性怎么样才能实现。你们不但给工人阶级，而且给资产阶级也指出了新的和平发展的道路。这条道路使各国人民能够避免过去注定无法避免的同类相残和苦难。
    在深切地感谢你们的斗争、你们的牺牲、你们的努力和你们的帮助的时候，我向你们，中国共产党的同志们保证，西班牙共产党将根据你们的经验，根据伟大的苏联共产党的经验和整个世界共产主义运动的经验，努力把我国一切的民族力量结成一条民主进步的牢固的战线，这个民族力量在我国争取和平民主与社会主义的斗争中是和人民福利、国家富强具有共同利益的。
    中国共产党第八次代表大会万岁！
    和平和各国人民的友谊万岁！（附图片）
