Xinhua News Agency, September 27th. Premier Zhou Enlai held a grand banquet at the Beijing Hotel tonight to welcome the Prime Minister of Nepal, Tanka Prasad Acharya.

    At the banquet, attended by 700 guests, Premier Zhou said that the Chinese people highly respect and welcome the Kingdom of Nepal's policy of peace and neutrality in international relations and its policy of promoting friendship and solidarity with all countries, especially Asian countries. He said that in our future relations with Nepal, we will prove with practical actions that we strictly abide by the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

    In his speech welcoming Prime Minister Acharya and other distinguished Nepalese guests, Premier Zhou also stated that the "Agreement between the People's Republic of China and the Kingdom of Nepal on Maintaining Friendly Relations and on Trade and Transportation between the Tibet Region of China and Nepal," recently signed by the Chinese and Nepalese governments, is a new milestone in Sino-Nepalese friendship. He said that this agreement demonstrates that, between China and Nepal, just as between China and India, friendly and close neighborly relations have been established based on the Five Principles first initiated by China and India.

    In his speech, Prime Minister Acharya reiterated Nepal's friendship and goodwill towards China, saying that Nepal has never harbored suspicions towards its friendly neighbor because China and India are both great promoters of peace, friendship, and peaceful coexistence in modern times. He said, "I am confident that our three friendly countries will certainly help each other in their respective national development."

    The Nepalese Prime Minister pointed out that Nepal, which believes in the teachings of Shakyamuni, follows a policy of peace and friendship. He said, "In our view, aggression is an unjust act, and peaceful coexistence is the ideal that everyone should follow in their dealings with other countries. The Government of Nepal will, in its own way, always uphold the cause of oppressed and downtrodden people in the world."

    At the end of their speeches, Premier Zhou Enlai and Prime Minister Acharya, together with the guests, toasted to the friendship between China and Nepal, to the friendship and solidarity of Asian countries, to world peace, and to the health of King Mahendra and Chairman Mao Zedong. The band played the national anthems of Nepal and China.

    The banquet began at 8 p.m. Vice Chairman Zhu De and Premier Zhou Enlai accompanied the distinguished guests into the magnificent banquet hall. The band played welcoming music, and the guests attending the banquet stood up and applauded warmly to express their welcome.

    Accompanying the Prime Minister of Nepal at the banquet were the Prime Minister's wife, the Nepalese Ambassador to China, Lieutenant General Rana, and other senior officials accompanying him, as well as B. Misra, Chairman of the Nepal People's Party, who is also visiting China.

    周总理盛宴欢迎阿查里雅首相
    新华社27日讯　周恩来总理今天晚间在北京饭店举行盛大宴会，欢迎尼泊尔首相坦卡·普拉萨德·阿查里雅。
    周总理在这个有七百位宾客参加的宴会上说，中国人民十分尊重和欢迎尼泊尔王国政府在国际关系中所采取的和平中立政策和促进同一切国家，特别是亚洲国家友好团结的政策。他说，今后，在我们同尼泊尔的关系中，我们将会用实际行动来证明我们是严格遵守和平共处的五项原则的。
    周总理在欢迎阿查里雅首相和其他的尼泊尔贵宾的讲话中还说，中尼两国政府最近签订的“中华人民共和国和尼泊尔王国保持友好关系以及关于中国西藏地方和尼泊尔之间的通商和交通的协定”是中尼友谊的新的里程碑。他说，这个协定说明，在中国和尼泊尔之间，正像在中国和印度之间一样，已经根据中国和印度首先倡议的五项原则，建立起友好和亲密的睦邻关系。
    阿查里雅首相致词重申尼泊尔对中国的友谊和善意，他说，尼泊尔从未对它的友好的邻居抱有疑惧，因为中国和印度都是当代和平友谊与和平共处的伟大促进者。他说，我确信我们三个友好国家对彼此的国家建设是一定会互相帮助的。
    这位尼泊尔首相指出，信奉释迦牟尼的教义的尼泊尔的政策，是一种和平和友谊的政策。他说，照我们看来，侵略是不正当的行为，和平共处才是大家在和别的国家的交往中都应该遵从的理想。尼泊尔政府将以它自己的方式永远维护世界上被压迫和被蹂躏的人民的事业。
