Xinhua News Agency, September 28th. Nepalese Prime Minister Acharya, his wife, and accompanying senior officials visited the Central Institute for Nationalities this morning.

    In a classroom in the classroom building, the Nepalese guests saw dozens of Tibetan students attending a Tibetan language class. Prime Minister Acharya examined a student's Tibetan textbook and read the Latin transcription of the Tibetan textbook with great interest. In a classroom of students from various ethnic groups in Xinjiang, Su Keqin, the vice president of the institute, told the guests that these students were all incumbent county-level cadres. The Prime Minister said that this method of training ethnic minority cadres was very necessary.

    The distinguished guests were very interested in the situation of the Tibetan students at the institute. In the Tibetan students' scripture hall, the Prime Minister and accompanying officials carefully examined the treasured "Kangyur Sutra." Among the student representatives accompanying the visit, the Prime Minister's wife quickly found a Tibetan girl named Laji, and they held hands affectionately and toured together for a long time. When visiting the reading room where newspapers in various ethnic languages were displayed, the Prime Minister asked Laji to introduce a Tibetan newspaper. She told the Prime Minister in Tibetan that it was the "Tibet Daily" and that the title of the editorial was "Important Issues in the Construction of Tibet."

    After the Prime Minister learned that there were nine hundred Tibetan students among the more than two thousand three hundred students at the institute, he asked if any of them understood Nepali. Vice President Su Keqin said that a few could speak a little Nepali. Soon, a Lhasa girl named Shanli, who had been studying at the institute for three years, was found to meet the distinguished guests. The Prime Minister immediately spoke to her in Nepali, asking how long she had been studying here. Other accompanying officials also talked to her. They talked very warmly.

    When the distinguished guests arrived in front of the building of the exhibition hall of cultural relics of various ethnic groups, it was during a break between classes, and students flocked out to applaud Prime Minister Acharya and welcome him.

    Wang Feng, Vice Chairman of the Nationalities Affairs Commission, and Ma Zhenwu, Deputy Director of the Protocol Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, accompanied the Prime Minister and others on the visit today.

    阿查里雅参观中央民族学院
    新华社28日讯　尼泊尔首相阿查里雅和他的夫人以及随行高级官员，今天上午参观了中央民族学院。
    在课室楼的一个教室里，尼泊尔贵宾们看到数十个藏族学生正在上藏文课。阿查里雅首相翻看了一个学生的藏文课本，并且很有兴致地念读了藏文课本的拉丁注音。在一个新疆各族学生的教室里，这个学院的副院长苏克勤告诉客人们，这些学生都是在职的县级干部。首相说，这样训练民族干部的办法是非常必要的。
    贵宾们对于这个学院的藏族学生情况感到很有兴趣。在藏族学生的藏经堂里，首相和随行官员们仔细翻看了珍藏的“甘珠尔经”。在陪同参观的学生代表中，首相夫人很快发现了一位藏族姑娘拉金，她们亲切地拉着手一起参观了很久。在参观陈列有各族文字报纸的阅览室的时候，首相要拉金介绍一份藏文报纸，她就用藏语向首相说，这是“西藏日报”，社论的题目是“建设西藏的重要问题”。
    首相知道这个学院两千三百多学生中有九百名藏族学生以后，问他们中有懂得尼泊尔文的没有，苏克勤副院长说有几个会说一点尼泊尔语。很快就找来了一个在这个学院已经上学三年的拉萨姑娘珊丽同贵宾们见面。首相立即同她用尼泊尔语谈话，问她来这里上学多久了。其他随行官员也都同她交谈起来。他们谈得很亲切。
    贵宾们来到各民族文物展览室大楼前的时候，正逢课间休息，学生们都涌出来向阿查里雅首相鼓掌欢迎。
    今天陪同首相等前往参观的有民族事务委员会副主任汪锋和外交部礼宾司副司长马振武。
