    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 7th: Phnom Penh dispatch: Cambodian King Suramarit has requested the Cambodian Ambassador to the United States, Long Kinny, to form a cabinet.
    Not long ago, Chairman of the Cambodian Royal Council, Sim Var, attempted to form a cabinet, but because he failed to obtain the necessary support, he abandoned his efforts to organize a new cabinet on the evening of September 4th.
    The Cambodian King also appointed Prince Sihanouk to form a cabinet on September 3rd. The former Cambodian Prime Minister initially rejected the task of forming a cabinet on the 4th. However, Sihanouk said that if no other way can be found to resolve the month-long government crisis, he will change this decision.

    柬埔寨新阁尚未组成
    据新华社河内7日电　金边消息：柬埔寨国王苏拉玛里特已经要求柬埔寨驻美国大使龙金尼组阁。
    不久以前，柬埔寨王国议会主席沈华曾经试图组阁，因为未能得到必要的支持，他在9月4日晚上放弃了组织新阁的努力。
    柬埔寨国王也曾经在9月3日指定西哈努克亲王组阁，这位柬埔寨前首相在4日初步拒绝了组阁的任务。但是，西哈努克说：如果无法找到解决历时一月的政府危机的其他办法，他将改变这一决定。
