Anshan dispatch from our newspaper—Workers at Anshan Iron and Steel's Second Steel Plant set a new record of producing twenty heats of steel in a single day on September 16 since the plant began operations. The output exceeded the average national planned target by 25%, fast steelmaking furnaces accounted for 60% of the heats tapped, the quality fully met national standards, and six of the heats were high-quality killed steel.
