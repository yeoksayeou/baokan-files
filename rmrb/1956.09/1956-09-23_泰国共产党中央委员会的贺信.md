To the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China,
and forwarded to the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China:

    On the occasion of the historic 8th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, we, on behalf of the Communist Party of Thailand and the people of all ethnic groups in Thailand who are struggling for independence, freedom, peace, and democracy, extend our heartfelt fraternal congratulations to the Congress!
    Under the wise and creative leadership of the Communist Party of China, the revolutionary struggle of Chinese people has continuously overcome difficulties and achieved great victories, laying a solid foundation for the socialist system in China and making significant contributions to the arduous cause of striving for lasting peace in Asia and the world. This has infinitely encouraged and exemplified the people of all countries who are struggling for independence, freedom, peace, and democracy. Facts have proven that the people in colonial and semi-colonial countries oppressed and exploited by imperialism and feudalism can only achieve true independence, freedom, and democratic happiness by uniting together, forming a national democratic united front, and resolutely fighting against imperialism and feudalism. The Thai people have always cared for and sincerely rejoiced in the brilliant achievements of the Chinese people. The achievements of the Chinese people have increased the confidence of the Thai people in the bright prospects of their struggle a thousandfold. At present, the Communist Party of Thailand and the Thai people are persistently uniting all national forces to fight against the aggression of American imperialism and to realize Thailand's independence, peace, and democracy.
    We firmly believe that under the glorious banner of Marxism-Leninism and the wise leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong and the Central Committee of your Party, through this Congress, the Communist Party of China will more unitedly and valiantly lead the Chinese people to victoriously complete socialist construction and make new contributions to the cause of maintaining world lasting peace and promoting human progress.
    We wish the Congress success!
                  The Central Committee of the Communist Party of Thailand

    泰国共产党中央委员会的贺信中国共产党中央委员会并转中国共产党第八次全国代表大会：
    兹值中国共产党举行具有历史性的第八次全国代表大会之际，我们谨代表泰国共产党和正在为独立自由与和平民主而斗争的泰国各民族人民向大会致以衷心的兄弟庆贺！
    中国人民的革命斗争在中国共产党英明的和具有创造性的领导下，不断地战胜困难，获得了伟大的胜利，已经使社会主义制度在中国打下坚固的基础，并为争取亚洲以及全世界的持久和平的艰巨事业作出了巨大的贡献。这对于正在为争取独立自由与和平民主而斗争的各国人民具有着无限的鼓舞和示范作用。事实证明，在帝国主义、封建主义压迫和剥削下的殖民地、半殖民地国家的人民，只有团结一致，结成民族民主统一战线，对帝国主义和封建主义进行坚决的斗争，才能获得真正的独立自由和民主幸福。泰国人民一向关怀和衷心欢庆中国人民所得到的光辉成就。中国人民的成就使泰国人民对自己的斗争的美好前景增强了千百倍的信心。目前泰国共产党和泰国人民正在坚持进行团结全国力量，为反对美帝国主义的侵略，为实现泰国的独立和平和民主而斗争。
    我们坚信，在马克思列宁主义的光辉旗帜下，在毛泽东同志和贵党中央的英明领导下，通过此次大会，中国共产党将更加团结和英勇地领导中国人民胜利完成社会主义建设，并为维护世界持久和平和促进人类进步的事业作出新的贡献。
    谨祝大会成功！
                  泰国共产党中央委员会
                      一九五六年八月三十日
