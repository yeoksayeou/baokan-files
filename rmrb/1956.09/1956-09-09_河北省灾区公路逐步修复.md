Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 7th. The transportation departments of Hebei Province are actively rushing to repair roads destroyed by the floods to ensure that supplies are transported to the disaster areas. In August, more than 170,000 tons of supplies were transported by road to eight special districts including Xingtai, Handan, Shijiazhuang, Baoding, Tianjin, and Tongxian.
    The roads within the Handan Special District were almost entirely destroyed or submerged by the floods in early August, but now they have been basically repaired and opened to traffic. On the highways from Xingtai to Wei County and from Xingtai to Ren County, trucks, horse-drawn carts, and rickshaws carrying various supplies are continuously arriving. The routes from Ding County to Li County, Ding County to Quyang, Baoding to Mancheng, and Gaobeidian to Laiyuan in Baoding Special District have all been restored to traffic, and the volume of freight transport has greatly increased.

    河北省灾区公路逐步修复
    新华社保定7日电　河北省交通运输部门积极抢修被大水冲毁的公路，保证把物资运送到灾区。8月份，通过公路运送到邢台、邯郸、石家庄、保定、天津、通县等八个专区的物资有十七万多吨。
    邯郸专区境内的公路，在8月上旬几乎全被大水冲毁或淹没，现在基本上已经修复通车。邢台至威县、邢台至任县的公路上，目前载运各种物资的汽车、马车、人力车源源不绝。保定专区定县至蠡县、定县至曲阳、保定至满城、高碑店至涞源等线路，全部恢复通车，目前物资运输量已大大增加。
