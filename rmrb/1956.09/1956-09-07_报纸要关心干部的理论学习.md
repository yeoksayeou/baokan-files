    Newspapers Should Be Concerned About Cadres' Theoretical Study
    In July, the number of People's Daily subscriptions among cadres and schools in the urban area of Wushan County, Sichuan Province, increased by more than 45% compared to the previous month. This shows that the revised People's Daily has been welcomed by many readers.
    However, the People's Daily does not pay enough attention to the theoretical education of cadres. Occasionally, one or two articles on this topic are published in the newspaper, such as "Some Experiences in Persisting in On-the-Job Learning" on August 8, which is helpful to us. Unfortunately, very little else about cadres' theoretical study is seen in the newspaper. Qi Qi

    报纸要关心干部的理论学习
    四川省巫山县城区机关干部和学校，在七月份订阅的人民日报，比上月增加了45％以上，这说明人民日报改版以后，得到了很多读者的欢迎。
    但是，人民日报对在职干部的理论教育工作，注意得很不够。报纸上偶而发表了一两篇有关这方面内容的文章，如8月8日的“坚持在职学习的一点感受”，对我们也是有帮助的。可惜，关于干部理论学习的其它问题，在报纸上见到的实在太少了。　　漆齐
