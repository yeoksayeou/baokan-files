    A Neolithic Village
    Li Qian

    The area along the Chan River in the eastern suburbs of Xi'an is a beautiful scenic area. Here lies the site of a Neolithic village currently under excavation.

    The site of this village, where our ancestors lived four or five thousand years ago, covers an area of more than 10,000 square meters. More than 3,000 square meters have been excavated so far, revealing thirty-six round and square houses. Some houses have walls made of mud mixed with grass and supported by wooden sticks; other houses were built by digging pits in the earth, using the pit walls as the walls of the house. The roofs were generally made of wooden planks or rafters supported by wooden pillars, covered with clay. The doors of both the round and square houses face south; the doorways are very narrow, allowing only one person to pass through at a time. At the entrance, some have steps similar to modern houses, while others have slopes. In the middle of each house, there is one or more hearths. Next to the dwellings, many small-bottomed, large-mouthed circular cellars for storing things were also discovered.

    Near the houses, more than forty children's corpses were buried in coarse pottery urns, covered with fine pottery bowls or basins. Most of these children were buried in groups. Further north, away from the residences, more than one hundred and thirty adult tombs were excavated. Most of the burial objects were daily necessities such as pottery bottles and pottery jars used by people at that time. One tomb of a child of about ten years old was very well preserved. The child's waist was surrounded by sixty-three bone beads, and below the ears were jade earrings, along with many other burial objects, such as pointed-bottom pottery bottles, pottery jars covered with fine red pottery bowls, and fine pottery bowls filled with millet. In addition, several kiln sites for firing pottery were also found east of the houses.

    Over the past year, more than two thousand items, including production tools, daily necessities, and decorations used by people at that time, have been excavated from this village. These utensils are mainly made of stone, bone, and pottery. The types of stone tools include stone axes, stone knives, stone mills, stone pestles, stone chisels, and stone rings (ornaments). There are also many types of bone tools, which are smooth and exquisite, including bone knives, bone shovels, bone awls, bone fishhooks, bone harpoons, bone beads, bone spoons, bone needles, bone arrows, and bone hairpins. The most exquisite bone tool is the bone fishhook, whose ingenuity and practicality are comparable to the fishhooks we use today. The next most exquisite are the bone needles, the longest being over one decimeter and the shortest being about the size of the embroidery needles we use today, slightly thicker than the needles we use today, with the same shape and a round and smooth surface. Two to three hundred pieces of pottery have been unearthed here, with complex types, colors, and patterns. Pottery types include pottery jars, pointed-bottom pottery bottles, pottery spinning wheels, pottery basins, pottery bowls, and pottery pots. In terms of pottery quality, there are fine red pottery, fine black pottery, and fine gray pottery that are as smooth as porcelain, and coarse red pottery and coarse gray pottery that are as coarse as the pottery basins we use today. White pottery fragments and colored pottery have also been found here. The colored pottery has patterns such as grain leaf shapes, geometric shapes, and fishnet patterns; some pottery is painted with realistic fish and human head-shaped patterns.

    The discovery of such a complete Neolithic village site is the first in our country, which provides rich materials for studying the history of the Neolithic period in our country.

    一个新石器时代的村落
    李茜
    西安市东郊滻河沿岸，是一个风景优美的地区。这里有正在发掘中的新石器时代村落的遗址。
    这个四、五千年以前我们祖先居住过的村落的遗址，面积约一万多平方公尺，目前已经发掘了三千多平方公尺，发现了三十六座圆形和方形的房子。有些房子的墙是用掺草的泥土加上木棍做成的；有些房子是把土地挖成坑，把坑壁做墙壁。屋顶一般都是用木柱子支持的木板或木椽排列起来，盖上粘土做成的。圆房子和方房子的门都向南开；门口很窄狭，只能容一个人走进去。进门的地方，有的是和现代房子差不多的台阶，有的是斜坡。在每间房子的中间都有一个或几个炉灶。在住房的旁边，还发现很多口小底大的贮藏东西的圆形窖穴。
    在房子附近埋葬着用粗陶瓮盛着的四十多个小孩尸体，陶瓮上面盖有细陶钵或细陶盆。这些小孩大多是一群一群集中埋葬的。离居室较远的北部，挖掘出一百三十多座成人的墓葬。随葬品中绝大部分是当时人们使用的陶瓶、陶罐等生活用品。有一个十多岁的小孩的墓葬很完整，小孩尸体的腰部围着六十三颗骨制的珠子，耳朵下边有一个碧玉制成的耳坠子，还有很多其他的随葬品，尖底陶瓶、细红陶钵盖着的陶罐，盛着小米的细陶钵等。另外，在房子的东边还发现几个烧陶器窑的遗址。
    一年多以来，在这个村落中共挖掘出当时人们使用的生产工具、生活日用品和装饰品等二千多件。这些用具主要是石器、骨器和陶器。石器的品种，有石斧、石刀、石磨、石杵、石凿、石环（装饰品）等。骨器的种类也很多，而且光滑精致，其中有骨刀、骨铲、骨锥、骨鱼钩、骨鱼叉、骨珠、骨匙、骨针、骨箭头、骨簪等。骨器中最精致的是骨鱼钩，它的精巧和实用程度可以同现在我们用的鱼钩媲美；其次是骨针，最长的一公寸多，最短的同现在用的绣花针差不多，比现在用的针稍粗一些，样子完全一样，表面又圆又光滑。这里出土的陶器共二、三百件，种类、颜色和花纹都很复杂。陶器品种，有陶罐、尖底陶瓶，还有陶纺轮、陶盆、陶钵、陶锅等。从陶质看来，有光滑得和瓷器差不多的细红陶、细黑陶和细灰陶，有粗得同我们现在用的陶盆差不多的粗红陶和粗灰陶。这里还发现了白陶片和彩色陶器，彩色陶器上有谷叶形、几何形、鱼网式等花纹；一部分陶器上则画着逼真的鱼形和人头形状的花纹。
    发现这样完整的新石器时代村落的遗址，在我国还是第一次，这对研究我国新石器时代的历史提供了丰富的资料。
