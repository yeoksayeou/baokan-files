Xinhua News Agency, September 4th - According to TASS reports: The President of the Republic of Indonesia, Sukarno, and his entourage are currently visiting Sverdlovsk, the largest industrial center in the Urals.

    On September 3rd, they visited the famous Ordzhonikidze Heavy Machinery Manufacturing Plant, the Ural Geological Museum, and the Sverdlovsk Young Pioneer Palace.

    During his visit to the Ordzhonikidze Heavy Machinery Manufacturing Plant, President Sukarno also attended a welcome meeting held for him by more than 15,000 workers of the factory and delivered a speech. Sukarno said, "Comrades, all people in the world are equal, and everyone is brothers and comrades. However, some countries oppress other countries, exploit them, and turn them into their colonies. This happens only because the social system of the suzerain state is unjust." Sukarno continued, "In your factory, I saw huge machines and various tools necessary for industry. Similar machines were used by other countries in the past to oppress our people. However, the machines I see here are not used to oppress the people of other countries. On the contrary, they are used to build a prosperous society in the Soviet Union. In addition, they are used to help develop and prosper the peaceful lives of other countries and peoples."

    Sukarno said, "Imperialism invaded Asian countries from the West, invaded Indonesia, and made the Indonesian nation a weak nation. However, our people rose up against imperialism and shattered its shackles. The people of other Asian and African countries also stood up against imperialism. Many Asian and African countries have already achieved freedom. But imperialism is still not dead. We are now continuing an unwavering struggle to extinguish all the poisons of imperialism. We are pleased that in this struggle, the sympathy of the Soviet people is on our side, and the sympathy of all progressive mankind is also on our side." Sukarno concluded, "Comrades, your ideals and our ideals are fundamentally the same. You and we both want to build a just and prosperous society and are fighting for freedom and peace."

    Sukarno's speech was repeatedly met with warm applause. (Attached picture)

    在乌拉尔工人的欢迎会上
    苏加诺盛赞苏联社会制度
    痛斥西方帝国主义侵略亚洲国家和印度尼西亚
    新华社4日讯　据塔斯社报道：印度尼西亚共和国总统苏加诺和他的随行人员现在正在乌拉尔最大的工业中心斯维德洛夫斯克参观和访问。
    9月3日，他们参观了著名的奥尔忠尼启则重型机器制造厂、乌拉尔地质博物馆和斯维德洛夫斯克少年先锋宫。
    在奥尔忠尼启则重型机器制造厂参观的时候，苏加诺总统还参加了这个工厂的一万五千多工人为他举行的欢迎会，并且在会上讲了话。苏加诺说，同志们，世界上所有的人都是平等的，大家都是兄弟、同志。但是，有些国家压迫其他国家，剥削它们，把它们变成自己的殖民地。发生这样的事只是由于宗主国的社会制度是不正义的。苏加诺接着说，在你们工厂里，我看到了工业必需的巨大的机器和各种各样的工具。类似这样的机器在过去是其他国家用来压迫我国人民的。但是，我在这里看到的机器并不是用来压迫其他国家人民的。相反，它们被用来在苏联建设一个繁荣的社会。此外，它们还用来帮助发展和繁荣其他国家和人民的和平生活。
    苏加诺说，帝国主义从西方侵入亚洲国家，侵略印度尼西亚，并且使印度尼西亚民族成为一个贫弱的民族。但是，我们的人民起来反对帝国主义，粉碎了它的枷锁。其他亚非国家人民也站起来反对帝国主义。许多亚非国家已经取得了自由。但是帝国主义仍然没有死亡。我们现在继续进行着坚持不渝的斗争以扑灭帝国主义的一切毒害。我们感到高兴的是，在这种斗争中，苏联人民的同情是在我们这一边，全体进步人类的同情也是在我们这一边的。苏加诺最后说，同志们，你们的理想和我们的理想基本上是一致的。你们和我们都想建立一个公正的和繁荣的社会，而且正在为自由和和平而奋斗。
    苏加诺的讲话不断博得热烈的掌声。（附图片）
