Xinhua News Agency, September 9th: According to a report by the Bulgarian Telegraph Agency, a grand rally was held in Sofia on the evening of September 8th to celebrate the 12th anniversary of Bulgaria's liberation.

Bulgarian Communist Party and government leaders Zhivkov, Yugov, and Damyano, representatives from all walks of life in Sofia, foreign diplomatic envoys to Bulgaria, and a delegation of veteran Bolsheviks from the Soviet Communist Party attended the celebration rally.

Bulgarian Communist Party Central Committee Secretary Bulgaranov delivered a report at the meeting. When discussing Bulgaria's achievements in socialist construction, he said in his report that Bulgaria's total industrial output in 1955 had increased to approximately five and a half times that of 1939. In 1955 alone, the increase in total industrial output was equal to half of the entire industrial production of 1939. Thanks to the heroic labor of the working class, the industrial production plan for the first half of this year was completed by 101.2%, and the total value of various goods provided by industry to the state was 1.383 billion leva (Bulgarian currency) more than in the first half of last year.

Bulgaranov then pointed out that in a very short period, Bulgaria had developed some heavy industry sectors that had never existed under fascist rule. In 1955, the ratio of production means to consumer goods production changed from 23:77 in 1939 to 50.7:49.3; coal mining increased from 2,214,000 tons in 1939 to 10,049,000 tons; electricity increased seven to eight times that of 1939; and ore mining increased 85 times that of 1939. Compared with 1948, the total output of ferrous metals in 1955 increased more than 21 times, non-ferrous metals increased more than five times, and the total output of machine manufacturing and metal processing industries increased six and a half times, with the output of the machine manufacturing industry alone increasing more than eight times.

Bulgaranov said that today, twelve years after the historic victory of September 9th, we are proud as a nation that the cooperative system in rural areas has been finally established as the only correct path for the development of Bulgarian agriculture.

Bulgaranov also spoke about Bulgaria's foreign policy. He pointed out that the Bulgarian government will continue to strive to develop comprehensive ties and economic cooperation with all countries, especially with Bulgaria's neighbors. The People's Republic of Bulgaria now maintains diplomatic relations with 32 countries and trade relations with 54 countries. He said that achievements have been made in eliminating abnormal relations with Yugoslavia. There are enormous possibilities for expanding economic and cultural cooperation and strengthening friendship between the peoples of Bulgaria, Greece, and Turkey. The Bulgarian people and their government will make every effort to effectively expand this noble cause.

After Bulgaranov's report, Moskatov, the head of the Soviet Communist Party veteran Bolshevik delegation, read out the congratulatory message from the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, and the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party to the Bulgarian people on the 12th anniversary of liberation.

Finally, the participants of the conference also passed a telegram of salute to the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, and the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party.

    索非亚举行庆祝保加利亚国庆大会
    布尔加拉诺夫报告社会主义建设的巨大成就
    新华社9日讯　据保加利亚通讯社报道：9月8日晚间，索非亚举行了保加利亚解放十二周年庆祝大会。
    保加利亚共产党和政府领导人日夫科夫、于哥夫、达米扬诺夫，索非亚各界代表，各国驻保加利亚外交使节和苏联共产党老布尔什维克代表团出席了庆祝大会。
    保共中央书记布尔加拉诺夫在会上作了报告。他在报告中谈到保加利亚的社会主义建设成就的时候说，1955年保加利亚的工业总产量已经增加到了1939年的五倍半左右。仅在1955年一年里，工业总产量的增长数字就为1939年全年工业产品数量的一半。由于工人阶级的英勇劳动，今年上半年工业生产计划完成了101.2％，工业向国家提供的各种货物总值比去年上半年多十三亿八千三百万列弗（保币）。
    布尔加拉诺夫接着指出，在极短的时期中，保加利亚已经发展了一些在法西斯统治下从未有过的重工业部门。1955年，生产资料和消费资料生产的对比已经从1939年的23比77变为50.7比49.3；煤的开采量从1939年的二百二十一万四千吨增加到一千零四万九千吨；电力增加到1939年的七、八倍；矿砂开采量增加到1939年的八十五倍。同1948年相比，1955年的黑色金属总产量增为二十一倍以上，有色金属增为五倍多，机器制造和金属加工工业总产量增为六倍半，其中机器制造业的产量则增为八倍以上。
    布尔加拉诺夫说，今天，在9月9日取得历史性的胜利的十二年之后，我们引以为民族自豪的是，农村中的合作化制度已作为保加利亚农业发展的唯一正确的道路而最后地确立起来。
    布尔加拉诺夫还谈到了保加利亚的外交政策。他指出，保加利亚政府今后仍将努力发展同各个国家的全面的联系和经济合作，特别是同保加利亚的邻国。现在保加利亚人民共和国同三十二个国家保有外交关系，同五十四个国家有贸易往来。他说，在消除同南斯拉夫不正常关系方面获得了成就。在扩大经济和文化合作、加强保加利亚、希腊和土耳其人民之间的友谊方面存在着巨大的可能性。保加利亚人民及其政府将尽一切努力来有效地扩大这一崇高事业。
    布尔加拉诺夫报告结束以后，苏共老布尔什维克代表团团长莫斯卡托夫在会上宣读了苏联最高苏维埃主席团、苏联部长会议和苏共中央向保加利亚人民祝贺解放十二周年的贺词。
    最后，大会参加者并且通过了给苏联最高苏维埃主席团、苏联部长会议和苏共中央委员会的致敬电。
