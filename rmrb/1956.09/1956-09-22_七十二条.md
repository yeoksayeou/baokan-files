    “Seventy-Two Articles”
    Nan Shan
    When I saw the seventy-two articles (originally seventy-two, changed to seventy-one when published in the newspaper) of the "Requirements for Unified Education of Students' Civilized Behavior" from Tianjin No. 16 Middle School in the "China Youth Daily" on August 29th, I was initially astonished, and then found it laughable.

    The content of these "seventy-two articles" is extremely extensive and detailed: they make very "unified" regulations regarding students' activities from morning to night, their posture and voice, the standards of "cleanliness" from head to toe, attitudes towards teachers and classmates...etc.; it is truly all-encompassing and can be called an "encyclopedia" of "requirements for unified education of civilized behavior."

    Of course, no one would deny that schools, like any other collective, need their own necessary discipline or regulations; but that can only be "necessary," and discipline or regulations that are built on a foundation of democratic self-awareness, and can never be mentioned in the same breath as things like the "seventy-two articles." Behind these "seventy-two articles," I seem to see lifeless, rigid faces of all sizes, and young boys and girls who are trembling and restless all day long! I really can't figure out what educational principles the educators of these young boys and girls' "civilized behavior" relied on to "create" so many original "regulations"!

    Some might say: This is dogmatism at work! I think not. There is currently no such dogmatic educational theory that would put so many seals on students' bodies and souls, forbidding them from moving or thinking at will!

    Some might say: This is a mechanical way of thinking at work, right? Again, I think not. There are probably no such "mechanical" thinkers in the world who imagine that they and others are all identical machines: that they must walk together when walking, sit together when sitting, and laugh together at the same time when laughing...

    But I finally found one explanation in my many thoughts. I think that, from the most fundamental point of view, the comrades who "created" these "seventy-two articles" probably lack basic trust in our young boys and girls, believing that they will only not fall if they are led by the nose; and lack a clear understanding of our advanced social system, believing that everything here needs to be "unified," and even needs to create a batch of "unified," obedient, and dull-witted descendants!

    So, what should we do? The "China Youth Daily" is launching a discussion; discussion is certainly beneficial, but we also need to think about the current situation of students in Tianjin No. 16 Middle School and "many other schools," and quickly stop implementing regulations like these "seventy-two articles," if they haven't already been stopped.

    Socialist builders should discard such so-called "requirements for unified education of civilized behavior" dead letter provisions without hesitation!

    “七十二条”
    南山
    在看到8月29日“中国青年报”上：天津市第十六中学“对学生文明行为统一教育的要求”的七十二条（原为七十二条，在报上发表时改成七十一条）规定的时候，我始而大为惊愕，继则觉得可笑。
    这“七十二条”的内容非常庞杂而细致：把学生从早到晚的活动、姿态和声音、从头到脚的“整洁”标准、对老师和同学的态度……等等，都作了非常“统一”的规定；真是应有尽有，堪称“文明行为统一的教育要求”的“百科全书”。
    当然，谁也不会否认，学校也同别的任何集体一样，需要有自己的必要的纪律或规定；但那只能是“必要的”，而且是建立在民主自觉的基础上的纪律或规定，绝不能同“七十二条”之类相提并论。在这“七十二条”后面，我仿佛看到了一张张死样活气的大大小小的面庞，一个个战战兢兢、终日坐立不安的少年和青年！我实在百思不得一解，这些少年和青年的“文明行为”的教导者，到底根据什么教育原理“创造”出这许多别出心裁的“规定”来的？
    或曰：这是教条主义在作怪！我以为不然。现在并没有这样的教育理论方面的教条，要在学生的肉体和灵魂上贴上这么多的封条，不准他随便动一动、想一想！
    或曰：这是机械的思想方法在作怪吧。我又以为不然。世界上大概还没有这样“机械”的思想家，设想自己和别人都是一模一样的机器：行则必定同行，坐则必定同坐，欢笑则必定同时欢笑……。
    但我终于在百思中得其一解了。我想，从最根本的一点上看来，“创造”这“七十二条”的同志们，恐怕缺乏对我们的少年和青年的起码的信任，以为只有牵着他们的鼻子走才不会摔跤；缺乏对我们这个先进的社会制度的确切的理解，以为我们这里什么都需要“统一”，甚至需要制造出一批“统一的”百依百顺、笨头笨脑的后代！
    那么，怎么办呢？“中国青年报”正在展开讨论；讨论诚然是有好处的，但我们还要为天津市第十六中学和“许多别的学校”的学生们眼前的处境想一下，赶快停止施行这“七十二条”一类的规定吧，如果还未停止的话。
    社会主义建设者，应该毫无顾惜地丢掉这类所谓“文明行为统一教育的要求”的死条文！
