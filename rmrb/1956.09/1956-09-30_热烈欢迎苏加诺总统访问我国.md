    Warmly Welcome President Sukarno's Visit to Our Country
    Today is the eve of our National Day. While preparing to celebrate the festival, the Chinese people also warmly and joyfully welcome President Sukarno of the Republic of Indonesia to our country for a state visit. We would like to express our highest respect to President Sukarno and, through him, to the Indonesian people!
    President Sukarno's visit to our country is a top-level event in the friendly and cooperative relations between our country and Indonesia. It marks a new milestone in the friendship between our two peoples. The personal contact between the leaders of our two countries will surely help to further deepen mutual understanding and trust between our two countries, and further develop the friendly cooperation between our two countries.
    Both our country and Indonesia are important countries in Asia. Our two peoples have a traditional friendship with a history of two thousand years. In the history of our two countries, there has never been hatred or war, only peaceful coexistence and friendly exchanges. In modern times, our two countries have even more common experiences and common aspirations. Our two peoples have both experienced long struggles against colonial rule, and have always sympathized with and supported each other in the struggle. Since the establishment of our respective new independent countries, in order to safeguard independence and build our own countries, our two peoples have yearned for a long-term international peaceful environment, and yearned for friendly cooperation with all countries. Therefore, both our countries advocate peaceful coexistence between countries, the widespread development of economic and cultural cooperation, and opposition to military aggression blocs and colonialism. At the same time, our two peoples, together with Asian and world peace-loving countries and peoples, are making joint efforts to safeguard peace in Asia and the world. This common experience and common aspiration constitute the basis for friendly cooperation between our country and Indonesia. The friendly cooperation between our two countries is entirely in line with the current and long-term interests of our two peoples, and it is conducive to the common cause of Asia and the world in opposing colonialism and safeguarding peace.
    The friendly and cooperative relationship between our country and Indonesia is based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. According to the trade and related agreements signed between the two parties, our two countries have expanded their equal and mutually beneficial trade relations. The cultural ties between our two countries have been greatly enhanced, and the friendly exchanges between the peoples of the two countries are becoming increasingly close. Not long ago, Vice Chairman Song Qingling of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of our country visited Indonesia at the invitation, and was warmly welcomed and received by the Indonesian government and people, which profoundly reflected the deep friendship between the people of our country and the Indonesian people. The Indonesian parliamentary delegation currently visiting our country is also warmly welcomed by our government and people. The Indonesian Bali Art Friendship Delegation is performing in Beijing. This expressive and deeply nationalistic dance has been warmly appreciated and highly praised by our audiences. It is clear that the development of friendly cooperation between our two countries is conducive to the common prosperity and happiness of our two countries.
    The Chinese people have always expressed deep sympathy and support for the clear stance taken by the Indonesian government and people on international affairs. Indonesia has always been on friendly terms with Asian and African countries, and has long taken concerted action with Asian and African countries in the United Nations to support the national independence movements in Vietnam, Morocco and other places. As one of the Colombo Conference countries, Indonesia has made significant contributions to promoting the Geneva Conference's agreement on the Indochina issue and initiating the Asian-African Conference. Now, the Indonesian government and people are actively supporting the Egyptian People's just action to nationalize the Suez Canal Company, and firmly advocate that the Suez Canal issue should be resolved peacefully on the basis of respecting Egypt's sovereignty and dignity. Indonesia's independent and autonomous foreign policy is playing an increasingly active role in maintaining peace in Asia and the world, and in uniting Asian and African countries to strive for their independence and oppose colonialism.
    The Chinese people express their deep gratitude to Indonesia for its active support for the restoration of our country's legitimate seat in the United Nations and for its support for our country's just actions to safeguard our country's sovereignty over Taiwan. The Chinese people also deeply sympathize with and support Indonesia's efforts to safeguard its territorial integrity and complete independence. Our people have always believed that West Irian, which is still occupied by colonialists, is an inseparable part of Indonesia's sacred territory, and Indonesia should completely recover it.
    Our people are also very pleased to see that the Indonesian people are confidently advancing along the road of developing an independent national economy. The program of the Indonesian government stipulates that a five-year plan for industrial construction should be formulated, that the economic structure of the colony should be transformed into a national economy, that national industries should be protected, that farmers' lives should be improved, and that working conditions should be improved. It can be seen that this is a correct path to get rid of the shackles of colonialism economically and move towards independent development. The Indonesian government resolutely rejects so-called economic assistance that is detrimental to national sovereignty and interests, and only accepts friendly assistance that does not attach any political conditions. President Sukarno said when he visited the United States in May this year: "We would rather work with our own hands in our country's land and jungles than exchange any part of our freedom for any assistance." This shows the great spirit of a warrior who cherishes freedom and fights to maintain independence.
    All the major achievements of Indonesia in international and domestic affairs are inextricably linked to President Sukarno's outstanding activities. President Sukarno's outstanding contributions to the cause of peace in the Asian-African region and the world are universally recognized. He has won a high reputation among the people of all countries in the world. President Sukarno has devoted his life to the national independence movement of Indonesia, made outstanding contributions to the victorious struggle of the Indonesian people against colonial rule, and has been supported and loved by the Indonesian people. President Sukarno's consistent adherence to the position and determination of Indonesian national unity is of particular significance to the Indonesian people's struggle to maintain national political and economic independence. President Sukarno regards Indonesian national unity as the "golden bridge of prosperity and happiness" for Indonesia. This idea will continue to exert great power in the cause of the Indonesian people.
    Our people cherish the friendship with the Indonesian people and will continue to work hard to continuously promote and strengthen friendly cooperation between the two countries. We firmly believe that through the joint efforts of the national leaders and people of the two countries, the friendly and cooperative relations between our two countries will surely be further developed.

    热烈欢迎苏加诺总统访问我国
    今天，是我国国庆节的前夕。中国人民在准备欢庆节日的同时，又怀着最大的愉快和喜悦的心情，热烈欢迎印度尼西亚共和国苏加诺总统来我国进行国事访问。我们谨向苏加诺总统并通过他向印度尼西亚人民表示崇高的敬意！
    苏加诺总统访问我国，是我国和印度尼西亚友好合作关系中头等重要的事件。它标志了我们两国人民之间的友谊的新的里程碑。我们两国领导人的亲自接触，必将有助于进一步加深我们两国的相互了解和信任，更加发展我们两国之间的友好合作。
    我国和印度尼西亚都是亚洲的重要国家。我们两国人民之间有着两千年历史的传统友谊。在我们两国的关系史中，从来没有存在过仇恨和战争，有的只是和睦相处和友好往来。在近代，我们两国更有着共同的经历和共同的愿望。我们两国人民都经历了反对殖民主义统治的长期斗争，并且在斗争中始终是相互同情和支持的。自从两国建立了各自的新的独立国家以后，为了维护独立和建设自己的国家，我们两国人民都渴望着一个长期的国际和平环境，渴望着同各国的友好合作。因此，我们两国都主张各国之间和平共处，广泛发展经济和文化合作，反对军事侵略集团，反对殖民主义。同时，我们两国人民同亚洲和全世界爱好和平的国家和人民一道，为维护亚洲及世界和平，进行着共同的努力。这种共同的经历和共同的愿望，构成了我国同印度尼西亚友好合作的基础。我们两国的友好合作，是完全符合我们两国人民目前的和长远的利益的，而且有助于亚洲和世界反对殖民主义、维护和平的共同事业。
    我国同印度尼西亚两国之间的友好合作关系，是建立在和平共处五项原则的基础上的。我们两国根据双方签订的贸易和有关协议，扩大了两国平等互利的贸易关系。我们两国的文化联系有着很大的增进，两国人民之间的友好往来日益密切。不久以前，我国全国人民代表大会常务委员会宋庆龄副委员长应邀访问了印度尼西亚，受到印度尼西亚政府和人民热烈的欢迎和接待，深刻地反映了我国人民同印度尼西亚人民之间的深厚友谊。现在正在我国访问的印度尼西亚国会代表团，同样受到我国政府和人民的热情欢迎。印度尼西亚峇厘艺术友好访问团正在北京表演。这种富于表情的和具有浓厚民族特色的舞蹈，受到我国观众的热烈赞赏和高度评价。很明显，我们两国友好合作关系的发展，有利于我们两国的共同繁荣和幸福。
    中国人民对于印度尼西亚政府和人民在国际事务上所采取的明确的立场，始终表示深切的同情和支持。印度尼西亚一向同亚非国家友好相处，很早就在联合国同亚非各国采取一致行动，支持越南、摩洛哥等地的民族独立运动。作为科伦坡会议国家之一，印度尼西亚对促成日内瓦会议达成关于印度支那问题的协议、发起和召开亚非会议，作出了重大的贡献。现在，印度尼西亚政府和人民又积极地支持埃及人民把苏伊士运河公司收归国有的正义行动，坚决主张苏伊士运河问题应该在尊重埃及的主权和尊严的基础上和平解决。印度尼西亚奉行的这种独立自主的外交政策，在维护亚洲和世界和平的事业中，在团结亚非各国争取它们的独立和反对殖民主义的斗争中，正在发挥出越来越大的积极的作用。
    中国人民对印度尼西亚积极支持我国恢复在联合国的合法地位，支持我国维护我国领土台湾的主权的正义行动，表示深切的感激。中国人民也深切地同情和支持印度尼西亚为保障领土完整和完全独立而进行的努力。我国人民一向认为，至今仍为殖民主义者所占据的西伊里安，是印度尼西亚神圣领土不可分割的一部分，印度尼西亚完全应该把它收回。
    我国人民还十分欣喜地看到，印度尼西亚人民正在满怀信心地沿着发展独立的民族经济的道路前进。印度尼西亚政府的政纲规定，要订出一个发展工业建设的五年计划，要把殖民地的经济结构改造为民族经济，要保护民族工业，提高农民生活和改善劳工条件。可以看出，这是一条在经济上摆脱殖民主义束缚而走向独立发展的正确道路。印度尼西亚政府坚决拒绝有损国家主权和利益的所谓经济援助，而只接受不附带任何政治条件的友谊的援助。苏加诺总统今年五月访问美国的时候就曾表示：“我们宁愿以我们的双手在我国的土地上和丛林中从事劳动，而不愿意以我们的自由的任何部分去换取任何援助”。这表现了一个珍爱自由并为维护独立而进行斗争的战士的伟大气魄。
    印度尼西亚在国际事务和国内事务中的一切重大成就，是同苏加诺总统的杰出的活动密切不可分的。苏加诺总统为亚非地区和世界的和平事业所作的杰出贡献，是大家公认的。他已在世界各国人民中赢得了崇高的声誉。苏加诺总统毕生从事于印度尼西亚的民族独立运动，对印度尼西亚人民反对殖民主义统治的胜利斗争，作了卓越的贡献，得到了印度尼西亚人民的支持和爱戴。苏加诺总统始终坚持印度尼西亚民族团结的立场和决心，对印度尼西亚人民维护国家政治独立和经济独立的斗争，具有特别重大的意义。苏加诺总统把印度尼西亚的民族团结，看成是印度尼西亚“繁荣和幸福的黄金桥梁”。这个思想在印度尼西亚人民的事业中，将继续发挥伟大的力量。
    我国人民十分珍视同印度尼西亚人民之间的友谊，并将继续努力，不断地促进和加强两国之间的友好合作。我们深信，经过两国国家领导人和人民的共同努力，我们两国之间的友好合作关系必定会有更大的发展。
