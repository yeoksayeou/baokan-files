Who Exactly is Responsible for Purchasing?
		Gao Changren

    Serious drought hit most areas of the Shaoyang Special District in Hunan Province this year. Farmers have been continuously struggling for more than two months. Among the more than 19,000 agricultural cooperatives in the entire special district, more than 13,000 cooperatives and more than 95,000 individual farmers face reduced production. Production and disaster relief work is extremely urgent.

    An important task in production and disaster relief is to promptly purchase the native products from the disaster victims to help them overcome difficulties in production and life. However, no one is responsible for purchasing the native products of the disaster victims.

    In the past, native products in the Shaoyang Special District were purchased by supply and marketing cooperatives and native product companies. Since the division of labor between the commercial and supply and marketing departments this spring, the business scope of the supply and marketing cooperatives has narrowed, and the native product companies have been abolished. Although many specialized companies have been established in the commercial sector, their grassroots organizations have not yet been established. This has created a "three-way no-man's land" situation. Animal products such as duck feathers in the area used to be purchased by the supply and marketing cooperatives, but now they are assigned to the newly established Agricultural Products Purchasing Bureau, which does not allow the supply and marketing cooperatives to purchase them. However, the purchasing bureau itself has not managed them well. Shredded radish and dried chili peppers are major local products in this area, but it is not clear who is responsible for purchasing them now. Ginger and magnolia slices used to be managed by the native product companies, but now this business has been assigned to the Food and Sundries Company, but this company has not yet established grassroots organizations. The Dongkou County Pharmaceutical Company once entrusted the supply and marketing cooperatives to purchase medicinal materials, but they downgraded the medicinal materials purchased by the supply and marketing cooperatives and lowered the prices, and the supply and marketing cooperatives could not afford the losses, so they stopped purchasing them. Cadres of the supply and marketing cooperatives said, "The more we purchase, the more we lose; the less we purchase, the less we lose; if we don't purchase, we don't lose." In addition, in terms of prices, the prices in the producing areas are suppressed too low, and the profits are too high. When commercial departments and institutions purchase on behalf of each other, the entrusting party often lowers the purchase price. All of these hinder the development of the native product purchasing work.

    In early August, the Shaoyang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a meeting of personnel from financial and economic departments to jointly study and propose some solutions: First, relevant departments are required to quickly establish their own grassroots organizations; if they cannot establish organizations, they should entrust the supply and marketing cooperatives to operate on their behalf, so as to quickly and timely purchase rural native products and support disaster-stricken farmers in production and self-rescue.

    到底谁负责收购
    高长任
    湖南省邵阳专区大部分地区今年发生了严重的旱灾。农民持续斗争了两个多月，全专区一万九千多个农业社，其中有一万三千多个社和九万五千多户单干农民要减产。生产救灾工作十分迫切。
    生产救灾当中的一项重要的工作，就是及时把灾民手里的土特产收购起来，以帮助灾民克服生产上和生活上的困难。但是，灾民的土特产却无人负责收购。
    邵阳专区的土特产过去是供销合作社和土产公司收购的。自从今春商业和供销部门分工以后，供销社的业务范围缩小了，土产公司撤销了。商业部门虽成立了许多专业公司，但这些专业公司的基层机构到现在还没有建立起来。这样就形成了“三不管”的局面。当地的鸭毛等畜产品，过去是供销社收购的，现在划归新成立的农产品采购局经营，不准供销社收购，可是采购局自己也没有好好经营。萝卜丝和干辣椒是这个地区的大宗土产，现在不知归谁收购。生姜和玉兰片，过去是土产公司经营的，现在这项业务划归食品杂货公司，但这个公司现在还没有建立起基层机构来。洞口县药材公司曾一度委托供销社收购药材，但他们对供销社收购的药材压级压价，供销社赔不起，因此也就不收了。供销社的干部说：“多收多亏本，少收少亏本，不收不亏本。”此外，在价格上，产地价格压得太低，利润过高；商业部门各机构在互相代购的时候，委托一方也常常压低收购价格。这些，都阻碍着土特产品收购工作的展开。
    中共邵阳地委在8月上旬曾召集财经部门人员共同研究，提出了一些解决的办法：首先要求有关部门赶快建立自己的基层机构；无法建立机构的，要委托供销合作社代为经营，以便迅速及时地收购农村的土特产品，支援灾区农民生产自救。
