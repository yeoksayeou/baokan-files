    Changes on a Road in Anshan City
    Recently, another twenty buildings are about to be completed on both sides of Shengli Road in Anshan City. This is part of the housing that Anshan Iron and Steel Company (An'gang) is building for its employees this year. Once completed, nearly five hundred employee families and four thousand single employees will move into their new homes.
    Three years ago, there were only scattered old houses along this road, and for four or five *li* in the middle, there was hardly a building to be seen. Now, when passing along this road, which is more than ten *hua li* long, you can see rows of brand-new buildings standing on both sides. The two rows of newly planted trees along the road are also more than a *zhang* tall. Among these new buildings are large-scale libraries, cinemas, and clubs, kindergartens surrounded by poplar groves, middle schools, primary schools, and technical schools, department stores, and canteens. Most of all, there are employee residences.
    On Youhao (Friendship) Street, which runs horizontally on both sides of Shengli Road, there is a cluster of two-story residential buildings arranged in the shape of the Russian word "Friendship." This is where workers from An'gang's steelmaking, chemical, and other plants live. There are also thirty four-story red buildings, housing more than 2,100 employees who moved in last spring. In recent years, tens of thousands of employees have become new residents on this road. Buses and trams run on the wide asphalt road, leading directly south to the center of Anshan City—the An'gang factory area—and north to the scenic Qianshan Mountain in the near suburbs and the famous employee residential area, Tianping Village.
    The lives of these new and old residents are also changing rapidly. When the reporter came to the home of Zhang Guizhi, the director of the Small Rolling Mill Family Committee, they were discussing the jacket tailoring method they had just learned in the sewing training class. Sewing machines, radios, bicycles, and watches are now relatively common items in workers' homes. Among the 417 worker families in their area, 250 already have sewing machines. After the supplementary wages were paid in August, even more families bought these items. The Shengli Department Store sold thirteen "Standard" brand sewing machines in half a day on the 24th. This month, the sales volume increased by 46.8% compared to last month. Most employees and their families here can also see movies and dramas three or four times a month.

    鞍山市一条马路的变化
    最近，在鞍山市胜利路两旁，又有二十座楼房就要竣工了。这是鞍钢今年为职工修建的住宅的一部分，建成后，将有近五百户职工家庭和四千个单身职工搬进新居。
    三年前，这条路的路旁只有一些稀稀落落的旧房子，而中间有四、五里路几乎见不到一间屋子。现在，当经过这条长达十多华里的马路时，可以看到矗立在两旁的一座座崭新的楼房，路旁两行新栽的树木也有一丈多高了。这些新的建筑物中，有规模很大的图书馆、电影院和俱乐部，有被包围在杨树丛中的幼儿园，有中学、小学和技工学校，百货商店、食堂，其中最多的是职工住宅。
    横排在胜利路两旁的友好街上，有一片排成俄文“友好”一词形状的二层楼住宅，这里集中居住着鞍钢炼钢、化工等厂的工人。还有三十座四层高的红色大楼，其中居住着二千一百多户职工，他们是去年春天新搬来的。几年来已经有上万户职工做了这条路上的新住户。在宽阔的柏油马路上，行驶着公共汽车和有轨电车，向南可以直通鞍山市中心——鞍钢工厂区，向北通到近郊风景区千山和著名的职工住宅区天平村。
    这些新住户和老住户的生活也在飞速的变化着，当记者来到小型轧钢厂家属委员会主任张桂芝家中时，她们正在讨论缝纫训练班里刚学到的上衣裁剪法。缝纫机、收音机、自行车和手表现在已是工人家中比较普通的东西，他们这一带四百一十七个工人家庭里，已有了二百五十台缝纫机。8月份补发工资后买这些东西的家庭就更多了，胜利商店在24日半天内就卖出了十三台标准牌缝纫机。这个月，商品的销售量比上个月增加了46.8％。这里的大多数职工和家属，每月还能看到三、四次电影和戏剧。
