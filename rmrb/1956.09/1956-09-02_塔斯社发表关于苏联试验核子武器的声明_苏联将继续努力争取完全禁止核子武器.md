Xinhua News Agency, September 1st. TASS, Moscow, August 31st: TASS statement.

    On August 24th and 30th, the Soviet Union conducted new nuclear weapon tests. These tests, like others to be conducted, aim to improve nuclear weapons and manufacture new types of nuclear weapons to equip various branches of the armed forces.

    In the Soviet Union, nuclear weapons are always tested at very high altitudes, which makes it possible to greatly reduce the number of radioactive particles. For the same purpose, the explosives used in the tests contain as little radioactive material as possible.

    Regarding the aforementioned nuclear weapon tests conducted in the Soviet Union, TASS is authorized to issue the following statement:

    The Soviet government, guided by its peace-loving policy, has repeatedly proposed in the United Nations the unconditional prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons. In the spring of 1956, the Soviet government proposed that governments possessing atomic and hydrogen weapons should guarantee not to test such weapons anymore, regardless of whether an agreement on other disarmament issues has been reached. Such an agreement could be the first step towards the prohibition and destruction of atomic weapons and would strengthen international trust.

    When speaking of the Soviet atomic tests, the leaders of the U.S. government pointed out the necessity to establish international control over atomic energy. The Soviet government believes that, since modern technological tools can easily detect nuclear weapon tests anywhere in the world, there is no need to establish any special system for controlling nuclear tests.

    However, it is well known that this proposal of the Soviet government, as well as the proposal to prohibit atomic and hydrogen weapons, has not received the support of the United States and some other Western countries. It is also known that nuclear and thermonuclear tests have been conducted in the United States and Britain this year. The Soviet government cannot ignore these circumstances and has had to pay due attention to the testing of nuclear weapons, based on its security interests.

    However, the Soviet government intends to continue its unremitting efforts to seek an international agreement on the complete prohibition of the production, storage, and use of nuclear weapons, as well as the testing of nuclear weapons.

    At the same time, the Soviet government is using all means to expand the work currently being done to use atomic energy for peaceful purposes.

### 塔斯社发表关于苏联试验核子武器的声明  苏联将继续努力争取完全禁止核子武器

    塔斯社发表关于苏联试验核子武器的声明
    苏联将继续努力争取完全禁止核子武器
    新华社1日讯　塔斯社莫斯科31日电：塔斯社的声明。
    8月24日和30日苏联曾经进行了新的核子武器试验。这些试验和将进行的其他试验一样，具有改进核子武器和制造用来装备不同兵种的新式核子武器的目的。
    在苏联，核子武器总是在极高的高度试验的，这就有可能大大减少放射性微粒的数量。为了同样的目的，试验的爆炸物里包含尽可能少的放射性物质。
    关于上述在苏联进行的核子武器试验，塔斯社受权发表如下声明：
    苏联政府以它的爱好和平的政策为准则，曾经一再在联合国中建议无条件禁止原子武器和氢武器。在1956年春季，苏联政府建议，拥有原子武器和氢武器的政府应保证不再试验这类武器，不管是否已经达成有关其他裁军问题的协议。这样一种协议可以成为走向禁止和销毁原子武器的第一步，并且将加强国际间的信任。
    美国政府领袖们在讲到苏联的原子试验时，指出有必要建立对原子能的国际管制。苏联政府认为，由于现代技术工具很容易侦察出在世界任何地方的核子武器试验，所以不须要建立任何特别管制核子试验的制度。
    但是，大家知道，苏联政府的这种建议，以及禁止原子武器和氢武器的建议，都没有获得美国和某些其他西方国家的支持。大家也知道，今年在美国和英国都曾进行过核子试验和热核子试验。苏联政府不能漠视这些情况，不得不从它的安全利益出发而对核子武器的试验予以适当的注意。
    但是，苏联政府打算继续进行它的坚持不懈的努力，来设法达成关于完全禁止生产、储藏和使用核子武器以及试验核子武器的国际协议。
    同时，苏联政府正在用一切方法扩大现在正在进行的把原子能用于和平目的的工作。
