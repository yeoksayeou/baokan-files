Xinhua News Agency, Prague, September 4th: According to the Albanian Telegraph Agency, at the Third National Congress of Agricultural Cooperative Representatives, Albanian Labor Party Central Committee Secretary Kambo said: The Albanian people have made remarkable achievements in developing agricultural cooperativization. As of now, 728 primary agricultural cooperatives (mutual aid teams) and 280 advanced agricultural cooperatives have been established nationwide. These two types of cooperatives own more than 27% of the country's cultivated land.

When agricultural cooperatives were first established in 1946, there were only seven agricultural cooperatives in the country. In the two years of 1955 and 1956 alone, 550 new agricultural cooperatives were established. During the cooperativization movement, middle peasants also largely participated in the cooperatives.

Kambo also said that in recent years, the total harvest and yield per unit area of all kinds of grains in agricultural cooperatives have exceeded those of individual farmers. In 1955, agricultural cooperatives produced 13% of the country's wheat, 73% of the sugar beets, and 26% of the cotton.

The material and cultural well-being of agricultural cooperative members has also improved significantly. In 1955, the remuneration for each workday of an agricultural cooperative member was: 3.7 kilograms of grain, 29 leks (Albanian currency) in cash, and other agricultural and livestock products.

The Third National Congress of Agricultural Cooperative Representatives of Albania opened in Korçë on September 3rd. The congress will determine specific measures for implementing the instructions and resolutions of the Third Congress of the Albanian Labor Party on agricultural collectivization, and will revise the regulations of agricultural cooperatives.

    阿尔巴尼亚举行农业合作社代表大会
    劳动党中央书记卡博报告农业合作化的成就
    新华社布拉格4日电　据阿尔巴尼亚通讯社报道：阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会书记卡博在全国第三届农业合作社代表大会上说：阿尔巴尼亚人民在发展农业合作化方面已经获得了显著的成就。截至目前为止，全国已经建立了七百二十八个初级农业合作社（共耕社）和二百八十个高级农业合作社，这两类合作社拥有的土地占全国耕地面积的27％以上。
    在1946年刚成立农业合作社的时候，全国只有七个农业合作社。在1955和1956两年中，新建的农业合作社就有五百五十个。在合作化运动中，中农也在很大程度上参加了合作社。
    卡博又说，最近几年来，农业合作社每一种谷物的总收成和单位面积的产量都超过了个体农民。1955年，农业合作社生产的小麦占全国生产的小麦的13％，甜菜占73％，棉花占26％。
    农业合作社社员的物质和文化福利也显著地改善了。1955年，农业合作社社员的每一个工作日的报酬是：谷物三点七公斤、现金二十九里克（阿币），另外还有其他农、畜产品。
    阿尔巴尼亚第三届农业合作社代表大会是9月3日在科尔察开幕的。大会将就执行阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第三次代表大会关于农业集体化的指示和决议确定具体的措施，并且将修改农业合作社章程。
