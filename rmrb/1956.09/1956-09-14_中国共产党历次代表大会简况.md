Brief History of the National Congresses of the Communist Party of China

    The First National Congress
    From July 1 to July 5, 1921, the First National Congress of the Communist Party of China was held in Shanghai, then the industrial center of China. This conference decided to establish the Communist Party of China. The delegates attending the conference included Mao Zedong, He Shuheng, Dong Biwu, Chen Tanqiu, and twelve others, representing fifty-seven party members. The delegates were sent by communist groups from Shanghai, Beijing, Changsha, Wuhan, Jinan, Guangzhou, and Tokyo (Japan) overseas. The Comintern also sent representatives to attend the conference.
    The conference was convened under the following circumstances: Since the end of World War I and the victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution in Russia, the revolutionary consciousness of the Chinese people has rapidly increased, and the number and scale of struggles of the Chinese working class have greatly developed (at this time, there were more than two million modern industrial workers in China). The "May Fourth" Movement in 1919 promoted the combination of the Chinese workers' movement and Marxist-Leninist theory. China saw revolutionary intellectuals with preliminary communist ideas represented by Li Dazhao and Mao Zedong, who successively established nearly ten communist groups in major cities in China and in Tokyo and Paris overseas from the beginning of 1920 to the first half of 1921 and engaged in workers' movements in Beijing (centered on Changxindian), Changsha, Shanghai, and other places. This prepared ideologically and organizationally for the establishment of the Communist Party of China.
    The conference discussed the following four issues: 1. The current political situation in China; 2. The basic tasks of the Party; 3. Adoption of the Party's constitution; 4. Establishment of the Party's leadership organs.
    The conference believed that the Party's basic task was to fight for the dictatorship of the proletariat; at that time, the Party should not only not reject but must actively participate in the bourgeois democratic revolution. The conference passed the first constitution of the Communist Party of China, deciding to build the Communist Party of China by following the example of the Soviet Communist Party and in accordance with Lenin's theory of party building.
    Regarding the Party's organizational structure, the conference decided to establish a Central Working Department in Shanghai, composed of three people, with a secretary, an organization director, and a propaganda director, with Chen Duxiu elected as the secretary. In addition, the conference also decided to establish local party organizations and develop the Socialist Youth League in various regions.
    Thus, through this conference, a completely new type of working-class revolutionary party with communism as its ultimate goal and Marxism-Leninism as its guide to action emerged in China; from then on, the Chinese revolution entered a new period, that is, the period of people's democratic revolution led by the working class.

    The Second National Congress
    The Second National Congress of the Communist Party of China was held in Shanghai in July 1922. The delegates attending the conference included Deng Zhongxia, Xiang Jingyu (female), Cai Hesen, and twelve others, representing one hundred and twenty-three party members.
    The domestic situation at that time was: The Chinese warlords, supported by imperialism, were engaged in infighting and levied exorbitant taxes, bringing serious disasters to people of all strata in China. The people of the whole country eagerly hoped to eliminate the warlord system and realize democracy, peace, and unity in China. At this time, the Chinese working class, with its own political leader—the leadership of the Communist Party of China—its high degree of revolutionary spirit and combat effectiveness was more fully demonstrated: Since January 1922, a vigorous first wave of workers' strikes had appeared in China, making imperialism and Chinese counter-revolutionary forces tremble with fear. The First National Labor Congress held in Guangzhou in May 1922 decided to take the two major slogans of anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism put forward by the Communist Party of China and strengthening the unity of trade unions across the country as the goals for future struggle. The Chinese working class had been closely united around the Communist Party of China. The Chinese working class had formed the core of China's democratic forces.
    The central task of this conference was to formulate a specific action program for the Party. The conference discussed and adopted the following four documents: Political Resolution, Organizational Resolution, Women's Movement Resolution, and the Second National Congress Declaration.
    The main issues discussed at the conference were concentratedly reflected in the conference declaration. The conference declaration made a correct analysis of the political and economic situation of Chinese society, pointed out the semi-colonial and semi-feudal nature of Chinese society at that time, determined that the revolution in China at that time was an anti-imperialist and anti-feudal national democratic revolution, and pointed out that the driving force of the Chinese revolution at this stage was the proletariat and the poor peasants; the petty bourgeoisie and the national bourgeoisie were also part of the revolutionary forces.
    The declaration stipulated the Party's maximum and minimum programs. It pointed out: "The Communist Party of China is the party of the Chinese proletariat. Its purpose is to organize the dictatorship of the proletariat, use class struggle to establish a political power of the workers and peasants' dictatorship (that is, the dictatorship of the proletariat), eliminate the private property system, and gradually reach a communist society." This is the Party's maximum program, which is also the Party's ultimate goal. The declaration also pointed out that the basic revolutionary tasks of the Chinese people at that time were: "(1) Eliminate internal strife, overthrow the warlords, and build domestic peace; "(2) Overthrow the oppression of international imperialism and achieve the complete independence of the Chinese nation; "(3) Unify the Chinese mainland (including the three northeastern provinces) into a truly democratic republic;..." This is the Party's minimum program, which is also the Party's goal for the democratic revolution stage.
    Clearly stipulating a thorough anti-imperialist and anti-feudal democratic revolutionary program was a major achievement of the Second National Congress of the Party. Because from the Opium War in 1840 to the establishment of the Communist Party of China in 1921, in these eighty years, although the Chinese people had carried out countless revolutionary struggles, no class or party was able to truly recognize that the basic task of the Chinese democratic revolution was anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism, and therefore it was impossible to propose a thorough anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolutionary program. And the party of the Chinese proletariat—the Communist Party of China—armed with Marxism-Leninism, correctly solved this major problem not long after its birth. This proves that only the Communist Party of China can correctly lead the Chinese revolution.
    However, the conference declaration also had shortcomings, that is, it lacked a clear understanding of the idea of the proletariat's leadership in the democratic revolution; it also did not pay attention to the most basic issue in the democratic revolution—the peasant land issue. These shortcomings were later developed by Chen Duxiu's right-leaning opportunists into an erroneous line of capitulationism.
    The Second Congress also decided that the Communist Party of China would join the Communist International, declaring that the Communist Party of China was a branch of the International Communist Party.

    The Third National Congress
    The Third National Congress of the Communist Party of China was held in Guangzhou in June 1923. The delegates attending the conference included Mao Zedong, Qu Qiubai, Zhang Tailei, Cai Hesen, and twenty-seven others, representing four hundred and thirty-two party members.
    The domestic situation at that time was: In February 1923, the "February 7th" massacre that shocked the whole country occurred. The workers' movement in North and Central China was bloodily suppressed by the warlord Wu Peifu, and the workers' movement temporarily turned to a low ebb. The lesson learned by the Party and the working class from the "February 7th" massacre was: To defeat the fully armed Chinese counter-revolutionary forces supported by imperialism, the strength of the working class alone was not enough, and it was also necessary to establish a revolutionary alliance with other anti-imperialist and anti-feudal classes. At that time, the revolutionary forces in southern China also suffered setbacks: In June 1922, the Guangdong warlord Chen Jiongming launched a counter-revolutionary coup with the support of British imperialism, and Sun Yat-sen fled from Guangzhou to Shanghai. At this time, Sun Yat-sen realized more clearly that the basic forces of the revolution were the workers and peasants, and it was not feasible to rely on warlords to oppose warlords. So Sun Yat-sen made up his mind to cooperate with the Communist Party.
    The main agenda of the conference was: 1. Discuss the draft Party program; 2. Discuss the issue of establishing a revolutionary united front with the Kuomintang led by Sun Yat-sen; 3. Elect the Party's Central Executive Committee. Among them, the discussion of the issue of establishing a revolutionary united front with the Kuomintang was the focus of this conference.
    When discussing the issue of establishing a revolutionary united front with the Kuomintang, the conference struggled against the right-leaning capitulationist tendency represented by Chen Duxiu and the "left" leaning closed-doorism tendency represented by Zhang Guotao. Finally, it passed a resolution on cooperation with the Kuomintang, deciding that Communist Party members would join the Kuomintang as individuals and reorganize the Kuomintang into a democratic revolutionary alliance of the working class, the peasantry, the urban petty bourgeoisie, and the bourgeois democrats, while maintaining the political and organizational independence of the Communist Party.
    The great historical significance of the Third National Congress of the Party lies in the fact that, based on the strategic principles of Marxism-Leninism and the specific conditions of China, it correctly formulated the basic policy of the national united front, enabling the Party to unite all possible forces to oppose the most vicious enemies of the Chinese revolution at that time—imperialism and feudal forces. The formulation and implementation of the Party's revolutionary united front policy greatly accelerated the pace of the Chinese revolution and promoted the arrival of a high tide of the Chinese revolution. Soon after the conference closed, the Chinese revolution entered the period of the First Revolutionary Civil War.
    The shortcomings of this conference were: It did not pay due attention to the peasant land issue and the establishment of a revolutionary army.
    At this conference, Comrade Mao Zedong was elected as a member of the Party Central Committee.

    The Fourth National Congress
    The Fourth National Congress of the Communist Party of China was held in Shanghai in January 1925. A total of twenty delegates attended the conference, representing nine hundred and fifty party members.
    The domestic situation at that time was: Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese revolutionary movement was developing rapidly. The Kuomintang had been reorganized, and a revolutionary united front based on the cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party had been established. The Guangdong Revolutionary Government and the Whampoa Military Academy were also successively established. The workers' movement and the peasants' movement were rapidly developing in Guangdong, Hunan, and other places. Guangdong had become the base area and guiding center of the Chinese revolution. In the north, the counter-revolutionary forces were also severely hit: In October 1924, the Northwest Army under the leadership of Feng Yuxiang turned to the revolution and overthrew the warlord government of Cao Kun and Wu Peifu in Beijing. Under the call of the Communist Party, the broad masses of people throughout the country were widely carrying out the movement to abolish unequal treaties and convene a national assembly. China was on the eve of a revolutionary storm.
    The central issue discussed at the conference was how to strengthen leadership over the increasingly high tide of the revolutionary movement and how to further develop the mass movement. The conference discussed and adopted the following resolutions and documents: the work report of the Central Executive Committee, the resolution on the national revolutionary movement, the resolution on the workers' movement, the resolution on the peasants' movement, the resolution on the women's movement, the resolution on the youth movement, the resolution on organizational issues, the second revised constitution of the Communist Party of China, and the declaration of the Fourth National Congress.
    The main gains of the conference were:
    1. It made a correct analysis of the political situation in China at that time, pointing out that China was in a period when the old ruling warlords (the Zhili faction Cao Kun and Wu Peifu) had fallen, and the power of the new ruling warlords (the Anhui faction Duan Qirui and the Fengtian faction Zhang Zuolin) had not yet been fully consolidated. The urgent task of the Party at that time was to organize the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolutionary struggle of the people throughout the country, deeply carry out the National Assembly movement, and crush Duan Qirui's evil plan to consolidate his reactionary rule by convening the so-called "post-war conference."
    2. It preliminarily summarized the experience of cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, criticized the "left" and right leaning errors of the Party in the united front work in the past year, and pointed out that since the reorganization of the Kuomintang, three factions, left, middle, and right, had formed internally. Therefore, the Communist Party's policy towards them must be to expand the left, win over the middle, and oppose the right.
    3. It comprehensively deployed the issue of going deep into the masses. In addition to deciding to work hard to develop various trade unions to strengthen the organizational strength of the proletariat, it also decided to vigorously develop the peasant, women, and youth movements.
    4. It improved the Party's leading role in the revolution. The conference believed that it was necessary to strengthen the Party's organizational work and propaganda work, so that the Party's work would "move from the work of Marxist-Leninist small groups to the work of encouraging the broad working class and the general revolutionary masses"; and it decided to establish Party organizations nationwide.
    In this way, the Fourth National Congress of the Party made organizational preparations for the imminent high tide of mass revolutionary struggle.
    The shortcomings of this conference were: It still did not pay attention to the peasant land issue and the establishment of a revolutionary army.

    The Fifth National Congress
    The Fifth National Congress of the Communist Party of China was held in Wuhan on April 27, 1927. A total of eighty delegates attended the conference, representing more than fifty-seven thousand nine hundred party members. The Comintern delegation and the Trade Union International delegation also participated in the conference.
    At that time, the Chinese revolution was at a critical juncture: When the First Revolutionary Civil War made significant progress, and the revolutionary army occupied the Yangtze River basin and advanced towards the Yellow River basin, the right-wing of the Kuomintang, headed by Chiang Kai-shek, betrayed the revolution in April 1927 and launched the "April 12th" counter-revolutionary coup in Shanghai. Nanjing formed a new counter-revolutionary center. Within the Kuomintang in Wuhan, headed by Wang Jingwei, reactionary tendencies were also growing. Under the threats, enticements, and blockades of Chiang Kai-shek and British, American, and other imperialists, the Wuhan Revolutionary Government faced the crisis of disintegration and division. At this time, within the Communist Party of China, which was the leader of the Chinese revolution, Chen Duxiu's right-leaning opportunist line had taken shape and occupied a dominant position within the Party. The right-leaning opportunist group was implementing a policy of unprincipled concessions to the right-wing of the Kuomintang, giving up the leadership of the proletariat over the revolution, and even opposing the workers' and peasants' movements along with the landlord and bourgeois classes, which in fact greatly strengthened the counter-revolutionary forces and weakened the revolutionary forces.
    Under such circumstances, the Fifth National Congress of the Party should have made a good summary of the past struggle experience, corrected Chen Duxiu's right-leaning capitulationist line, correctly stipulated the Party's current policies and tasks, and saved the crisis of the revolution. However, the conference did not complete this task. The conference discussed and adopted the following resolutions and documents: the resolution on the Communist Party of China accepting the resolution of the Seventh Congress of the Comintern on the China issue, the resolution on the political situation and the Party's tasks, the resolution on the land issue, the resolution on the workers' movement, and the declaration of the Fifth Congress. However, these resolutions had many shortcomings and were not implemented later.
    Although the conference also made some criticisms of Chen Duxiu's right-leaning opportunist errors, it did not thoroughly liquidate them; on the contrary, it continued to elect Chen Duxiu to serve as the Party's General Secretary. This shows that the majority of delegates at the conference did not have a sufficient understanding of the essence of right-leaning opportunism and its harm to the revolution.
    Regarding the most urgent peasant land issue at that time, the conference still did not completely solve it correctly. The conference only passed a very incomplete plan to confiscate the land rented out by large landlords and distribute it to the peasants, and due to the obstruction of Chen Duxiu's right-leaning opportunist group, it was not realized after the conference.
    The conference did not even discuss other major issues such as arming workers and peasants and reforming the army.
    Comrade Mao Zedong participated in this conference, but due to the dominance of Chen Duxiu's patriarchal system, Comrade Mao Zedong was completely excluded from the leadership of the conference and was deprived of the right to vote at the conference.
    The Fifth National Congress of the Party did not actually solve any problems. After the conference closed, the Party's leadership was still in the hands of right-leaning opportunist elements, and Chen Duxiu's erroneous line developed to the extreme, which made the Party in a weak and powerless position when the Wuhan Kuomintang and Chiang Kai-shek implemented a counter-revolutionary merger in July 1927, resulting in the tragic failure of the First Revolutionary Civil War.

    The Sixth National Congress
    The Sixth National Congress of the Communist Party of China was held in Moscow, the capital of the Soviet Union, in June 1928. This conference was held under the instructions and leadership of the Comintern. A total of eighty-four official delegates attended the conference, representing more than forty thousand party members.
    The domestic situation at that time was: After the failure of the revolution in 1927, new warlords such as Chiang Kai-shek established a bloody rule in China, the workers' and peasants' revolutionary forces were greatly devastated, the revolution temporarily turned to a low ebb, and the Communist Party of China led the Chinese people into the period of the Second Revolutionary Civil War. At this time, the revolutionary forces were forced to move from the open to the underground, from the cities to the countryside, and the Communist Party led the peasants to carry out the land revolution struggle. In the winter of 1927, under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, China's first rural revolutionary base area—the Jinggangshan base area—was established, and the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army was also formally formed. Comrade Mao Zedong opened up the only correct path for the development of the Chinese revolution.
    The central task of the Sixth Congress was to summarize the experience of the First Revolutionary Civil War, analyze the revolutionary situation at that time, and determine the Party's policies and line. The conference discussed and adopted the political resolution, the resolution on the organizational issues of the Soviet regime (that is, the workers' and peasants' democratic regime), the resolution on the land issue, the resolution on the peasant issue, the resolution on the workers' movement, and the new Party constitution, and elected a new Central Committee.
    The important achievements of this conference were:
    1. It correctly affirmed that Chinese society was a semi-colonial and semi-feudal society, determined that the revolution in China at this stage was still a bourgeois democratic revolution, that the general task of the revolution was to establish an anti-imperialist and anti-feudal workers' and peasants' democratic dictatorship, and formulated the ten major programs of the democratic revolution.
    2. It correctly pointed out that the political situation in the country at that time was between two revolutionary upsurges, pointed out the imbalance in the development of the revolution, and pointed out that the Party's general task at that time was not to attack, not to universally organize uprisings, but to win over the masses.
    3. It carried out a two-line struggle, liquidated Chen Duxiu's right-leaning opportunism, and also criticized the "left" leaning adventurism that existed at that time.
    The line formulated by the conference was basically correct.
    The errors and shortcomings of the Sixth Congress were: It lacked a correct estimate of the long-term nature of the Chinese democratic revolution, the two-sidedness of the middle classes, and the internal contradictions of the reactionary forces; it also lacked the necessary understanding of the strategic retreat needed by the Party after the failure of the First Revolutionary Civil War and of the importance of the rural revolutionary base areas. These shortcomings of the conference hindered the thorough correction of the "left" leaning errors within the Party, so that after the conference, the Party's leadership was still in the hands of "left" leaning elements.
    Comrade Mao Zedong did not attend this conference, but the conference elected him as a member of the Party Central Committee. After the conference, Comrade Mao Zedong not only developed the correct aspects of the conference line, but also theoretically and practically correctly solved many problems that were not solved and not correctly solved by this conference.

    The Seventh National Congress
    The Seventh National Congress of the Communist Party of China was held in Yan'an from April 23 to June 11, 1945. A total of five hundred and forty-seven official delegates and two hundred and eight alternate delegates attended the conference, representing one million two hundred and ten thousand party members.
    The situation at that time was: Internationally, the Soviet Red Army had approached Berlin, and Hitler's Germany was about to be defeated; Fascist Japan in the East was also under the siege of the Allied forces, and the world anti-fascist war was on the eve of victory. Domestically, the Kuomintang reactionaries continued their reactionary policy of passively resisting Japan and actively opposing communism, seriously hindering the unification of China's anti-Japanese forces and making China's civil war crisis increasingly serious. At this time, the people throughout the country unanimously demanded that the corrupt Kuomintang government and Kuomintang command be reorganized immediately, and a democratic coalition government and coalition command be established to overcome the crisis, strengthen the anti-Japanese forces, and greet the anti-Japanese counter-offensive.
    At the Seventh Congress, Comrade Mao Zedong delivered the political report "On Coalition Government"; Comrade Zhu De delivered the military report "On the Liberated Area Battlefield"; and Comrade Liu Shaoqi delivered the report on the revision of the Party Constitution. The conference passed the new Party Constitution and elected the Party's Central Committee.
    In the political report made by Comrade Mao Zedong, he scientifically analyzed the international and domestic situation at that time, clearly stipulated the tasks of the Party and the people of the whole country, and detailed the general and specific programs for defeating the Japanese aggressors and liberating all of China. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that there were two futures for China: one was the dark future of returning China to the old state of civil war, non-independence, non-autonomy, non-democracy, non-unity, and non-prosperity, which was what the Chinese reactionaries and foreign imperialist elements hoped for; the other was the bright future of building China into a new country that was independent, free, democratic, unified, and prosperous, which was what the broad masses of the Chinese people and foreign progressive people hoped for. The task of the Party and the Chinese people was to do everything possible to oppose the former future and strive for the latter future. Comrade Mao Zedong called on the whole Party to attach importance to urban work and to raise the work in the occupied areas to the same important position as the work in the liberated areas, so as to seize the big cities and take over the big cities when the counter-offensive came.
    According to Comrade Mao Zedong's political report, the conference formulated the Party's only correct political line, which was: "Freely mobilize the masses, strengthen the people's forces and under the leadership of the Party defeat the Japanese aggressors, liberate the people and establish a New Democratic China."
    In the military report made by Comrade Zhu De, he comprehensively summarized the experience of the Party in leading the armed struggle and the building of the people's army and determined the future military tasks of the liberated area battlefield: "The Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army should prepare to implement the strategic transition from the anti-Japanese guerrilla war to the anti-Japanese regular war in the later period of the anti-Japanese war...to welcome the battle of this anti-Japanese counter-offensive."
    The report on the revision of the Party Constitution made by Comrade Liu Shaoqi and the new Party Constitution passed by the conference comprehensively summarized the experience in Party building and correctly stipulated the Party's organizational line.
    Finally, after full deliberation and democratic discussion, the conference elected the Party's Seventh Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong. Compared with previous sessions, this Central Committee was the most perfect and prestigious Central Committee. It concentrated the wisdom of the whole Party and the people of the whole country and guaranteed the correctness of the Party's leadership based on the theory of Marxism-Leninism and the principle of the Party's collective leadership.
    The conference demonstrated the unprecedented unity and consensus of the whole Party. This unity was a unity under the principles of Marxism-Leninism, and a unity based on the extensive development of self-criticism and intra-party democracy. Therefore, Comrade Mao Zedong called this conference "a model of unity, a model of self-criticism, and a model of intra-party democracy."
    In this way, the Seventh National Congress of the Party not only formulated a completely correct political line, but also elected the central leadership organ that could unite the whole Party and the people of the whole country to thoroughly implement this political line. This was the guarantee of the victory of the Party and the Chinese revolution.
    After the conference closed, all members of the Communist Party of China and the people of the whole country, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, launched a more fierce struggle against the Japanese aggressors and their running dogs in China. On August 8, 1945, the Soviet Union declared war on Japan. With the vigorous assistance of the Soviet Red Army, the Anti-Japanese War quickly achieved its final victory. Then, because the Kuomintang reactionaries launched a civil war and fiercely attacked the liberated areas, the Party led the people to hold the Liberation War, and finally overthrew the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang and established the glorious and great People's Republic of China.

    中国共产党历次代表大会简况
    第一次全国代表大会
    1921年7月1日至5日，中国共产党的第一次全国代表大会，在当时的中国工业中心地上海举行。这次大会决定成立中国共产党。出席大会的代表有毛泽东、何叔衡、董必武、陈潭秋等十二人，代表了五十七个党员。代表是由上海、北京、长沙、武汉、济南、广州和海外东京（日本）等地的共产主义小组派来的。共产国际也派代表出席了这次大会。
    大会是在这样的形势下召开的：自第一次世界大战结束和伟大的俄国十月社会主义革命胜利以后，中国人民的革命觉悟迅速提高起来，中国工人阶级的人数和斗争规模大大发展起来（这时中国现代产业工人已有二百余万）。1919年的“五四”运动促进了中国工人运动和马克思列宁主义理论的结合，中国出现了以李大钊、毛泽东为代表的具有初步共产主义思想的革命知识分子，他们从1920年初到1921年上半年先后在中国各中心城市和国外东京、巴黎等地建立起近十个共产主义小组并在北京（以长辛店为中心）、长沙、上海等地从事工人运动。这样，就为中国共产党的成立作了思想上和组织上的准备。
    大会讨论的问题有以下四项：一、中国当前的政治状况；二、党的基本任务；三、通过党的章程；四、建立党的领导机构。
    大会认为党的基本任务是为争取无产阶级专政而斗争；当时，党不仅不应拒绝而且必须积极参加资产阶级民主革命。大会通过了中国共产党的第一个党章，决定以苏联共产党为榜样，遵照列宁的建党学说来建设中国共产党。
    关于党的组织机构，大会决定设立一个中央工作部，地址在上海，由三人组成，设书记、组织主任、宣传主任各一人，陈独秀被选为书记。此外，大会还决定建立党的地方组织和在各地发展社会主义青年团。
    这样，经过这次大会，就在中国出现了一个完全新型的、以共产主义为最终目的、以马克思列宁主义为行动指南的工人阶级革命政党；从此，中国革命也便进入一个崭新的时期，即以工人阶级为领导的人民民主革命时期。
    第二次全国代表大会
    中国共产党的第二次全国代表大会是1922年7月在上海召开的，出席大会的代表有邓中夏、向警予（女）、蔡和森等十二人，代表着一百二十三个党员。
    当时的国内形势是：在帝国主义支持下的中国各派军阀混战，横征暴敛，给中国各阶层人民带来了严重灾祸，全国人民热望铲除军阀制度，在中国实现民主、和平与统一。这时的中国工人阶级，由于有了自己的政治领袖——中国共产党的领导，它的高度的革命性和战斗性就更充分地显示出来：自1922年1月，中国出现了轰轰烈烈的第一次工人罢工高潮，使帝国主义和中国反革命势力胆战心惊。1922年5月在广州召开的第一次全国劳动大会，决定把中国共产党提出的反帝、反封建两大口号和加强全国职工团结作为今后奋斗的目标。中国工人阶级已紧密地团结在中国共产党的周围了。中国工人阶级已形成中国民主力量的核心。
    这次大会的中心任务，是制定党的具体行动纲领。大会讨论和通过了以下四个文件：政治决议案、组织决议案、妇女运动决议案以及第二次全国代表大会宣言。
    大会讨论的主要问题，集中地反映在大会宣言中。大会宣言对中国社会的政治经济情况进行了正确的分析，指出当时中国社会的半殖民地半封建性质，确定中国当时的革命是反帝反封建的民族民主革命，并指出现阶段中国革命的动力是无产阶级和贫苦农民；小资产阶级和民族资产阶级也是革命力量之一。
    宣言中规定了党的最高纲领和最低纲领。指出：“中国共产党是中国无产阶级的政党。他的目的是要组织无产阶级专政，用阶级斗争的手段，建立劳农专政（即无产阶级专政）的政治，铲除私有制度，渐次达到一个共产主义的社会。”这是党的最高纲领，也就是党的最终目的。宣言又指出中国人民当时的革命基本任务是：“（一）消除内乱，打倒军阀，建设国内和平；”“（二）推翻国际帝国主义的压迫，达到中华民族的完全独立；”“（三）统一中国本部（东三省在内），为真正民主共和国；……”这是党的最低纲领，也就是党在民主革命阶段的奋斗目标。
    明确规定彻底的反帝、反封建的民主主义革命纲领，是党的第二次全国代表大会的重大功绩。因为从1840年鸦片战争到1921年中国共产党成立，这八十年间，中国人民虽然进行了无数次的革命斗争，可是没有一个阶级和党派能够真正认清中国民主革命的基本任务是反帝和反封建，因而也就不可能提出彻底的反帝、反封建的革命纲领。而以马克思列宁主义武装起来的中国无产阶级的政党——中国共产党诞生不久，就正确地解决了这一重大问题。这就证明，只有中国共产党才能正确地领导中国革命。
    但大会宣言也有缺点，就是对于无产阶级在民主革命中的领导权思想，缺乏明确认识；对于民主革命中的最基本问题——农民土地问题，也没有加以注意。这些缺点，后来就被陈独秀右倾机会主义者发展为投降主义的错误路线。
    二次大会还决定中国共产党加入共产国际，宣布中国共产党是国际共产党的一个支部。
    第三次全国代表大会
    中国共产党的第三次全国代表大会是1923年6月在广州召开的，出席大会的代表有毛泽东、瞿秋白、张太雷、蔡和森等二十七人，代表着四百三十二个党员。
    当时的国内形势是：1923年2月，发生了震惊全国的“二七”惨案，华北、华中的工人运动遭到军阀吴佩孚的血腥镇压，工人运动暂时转入低潮。党和工人阶级从“二七”惨案中得到的教训是：要战胜全副武装的、有帝国主义支持的中国反革命势力，单靠工人阶级的力量是不够的，还必须同其他反帝、反封建的阶级建立革命联盟。当时中国南方的革命势力也遭到了挫折：1922年6月，广东军阀陈炯明在英帝国主义的支持下发动了反革命政变，孙中山从广州逃往上海。这时孙中山比较明确地认识到，革命的基本势力是工人、农民，依靠军阀反对军阀是不行的。于是孙中山才下定决心同共产党合作。
    大会的议程主要的是：一、讨论党纲草案；二、讨论同孙中山领导的国民党建立革命统一战线问题；三、选举党的中央执行委员会。其中讨论同国民党建立革命统一战线问题是这次大会的中心。
    大会在讨论同国民党建立革命统一战线问题的时候，曾与以陈独秀为代表的右倾投降主义倾向和以张国焘为代表的“左”倾关门主义倾向进行了斗争，最后通过了同国民党合作的决议，决定共产党员以个人身份加入国民党，把国民党改组为工人阶级、农民阶级、城市小资产阶级和资产阶级民主派的民主革命联盟，同时保持共产党在政治上和组织上的独立。
    党的第三次全国代表大会的伟大历史意义在于：它根据马克思列宁主义的策略原则和中国的具体情况，正确地制定了民族统一战线的基本方针，使党能够把一切可能联合的力量团结起来，去反对中国革命当时最凶恶的敌人——帝国主义和封建势力。党的革命统一战线方针的制定和实现，极大地加速了中国革命的步伐，促进了中国革命高潮的到来。大会闭幕不久，中国革命即进入第一次国内革命战争时期。
    这次大会的缺点是：对农民土地问题和建立革命军队问题没有加以应有的注意。
    在这次大会上，毛泽东同志当选为党的中央委员会委员。
    第四次全国代表大会
    中国共产党的第四次全国代表大会是1925年1月在上海召开的，出席大会的代表共二十人，代表着九百五十个党员。
    当时的国内形势是：中国革命运动在中国共产党的领导下正在突飞猛进的发展，国民党已进行了改组，以国共两党合作为基础的革命统一战线已建立起来，广东革命政府和黄埔军校也相继成立，工人运动和农民运动在广东、湖南等地迅速开展起来，广东已成为中国革命的根据地和指导中心。在北方，反革命势力也受到重大打击：1924年10月，冯玉祥领导下的西北军转向了革命，推翻了北京的曹琨、吴佩孚军阀政府。全国广大人民在共产党的号召下，广泛地开展着废除不平等条约和召集国民会议运动。中国正处于革命大风暴的前夜。
    大会讨论的中心问题，是如何对日益高涨的革命运动加强领导和如何进一步开展群众运动的问题。大会讨论并通过了以下决议和文件：中央执行委员会的工作报告、民族革命运动决议案、职工运动决议案、农民运动决议案、妇女运动决议案、青年运动决议案、组织问题决议案、中国共产党第二次修正章程和第四次全国代表大会宣言。
    大会的主要收获是：
    一、对当时中国政局作了正确分析，指出中国正处于旧统治军阀（直系曹琨、吴佩孚）倒台，新统治军阀（皖系段祺瑞、奉系张作霖）的势力尚未充分巩固的时期。当时党的紧急任务是：组织全国人民的反帝反封建革命斗争，深入开展国民会议运动，粉碎段祺瑞以召集所谓“善后会议”来巩固自己的反动统治的罪恶计划。
    二、初步总结了国共合作的经验，批判了一年来党在统一战线工作中的“左”倾和右倾的错误，指出国民党自改组以来，内部已形成左、中、右三派，因此，共产党对它们的方针必须是扩大左派、争取中派和反对右派。
    三、全面布置了深入群众工作的问题。除决定努力发展各种工会以壮大无产阶级的组织力量以外，并决定大力开展农民、妇女和青年运动。
    四、提高了党在革命中的领导作用。大会认为必须加强党的组织工作和宣传工作，使党的工作由马克思列宁主义小团体的工作，“进到鼓励广大的工人阶级及一般革命群众的工作”；并决定在全国范围内建立党的组织。
    这样，党的第四次全国代表大会就为行将到来的群众革命斗争高潮作了组织上的准备。
    这次大会的缺点是：对于农民土地问题和建立革命军队问题仍然没有加以注意。
    第五次全国代表大会
    中国共产党的第五次全国代表大会是1927年4月27日在武汉召开的，出席大会的代表共八十人，代表着五万七千九百多个党员。参加大会的还有共产国际代表团和职工国际代表团。
    当时中国革命正处于紧急关头：当第一次国内革命战争获得重大进展、革命军占领了长江流域并向黄河流域推进的时候，以蒋介石为首的国民党右派于1927年4月叛变了革命，在上海发动了“四一二”反革命政变。南京形成了新的反革命中心。而武汉以汪精卫为首的国民党内部，反动倾向也在增长。武汉革命政府在蒋介石和英、美等帝国主义的威胁、利诱和封锁下，面临着瓦解、分裂的危机。这时作为中国革命领导者的中国共产党的内部，陈独秀右倾机会主义路线已经形成，并在党内占据了统治地位，右倾机会主义集团对国民党右派实行着无原则的让步政策，放弃了无产阶级对革命的领导权，甚至随着地主资产阶级反对工农运动，这就在实际上大大地加强了反革命势力而削弱了革命势力。
    在这样的情况下，党的第五次全国代表大会本来应该很好地总结过去的斗争经验，纠正陈独秀右倾投降主义路线，正确规定当前党的方针和任务，挽救革命的危机。但是，大会并没有完成这一任务。大会讨论和通过了以下决议和文件：中国共产党接受共产国际第七次大会关于中国问题决议案之决议、政治形势与党的任务决议案、土地问题决议案、职工运动决议案及第五次代表大会宣言。而这些决议虽然有不少缺点，以后也未付诸实现。
    大会对陈独秀的右倾机会主义错误虽也有一定的批评，但并未对它进行彻底的清算；相反地，又继续选举陈独秀担任党的总书记职务。这表明大会的多数代表对于右倾机会主义的实质和它对革命的危害性是认识不足的。
    对于当时最为紧迫的农民土地问题，大会仍未完全正确解决。大会所通过的只是没收大地主出租土地分给农民的很不彻底的方案，而且由于陈独秀右倾机会主义集团的阻挠，在会后也没有实现。
    还有武装工农、改造军队等重大的问题，大会竟然没有加以讨论。
    毛泽东同志曾参加了这次大会，但由于陈独秀家长制度的统治，毛泽东同志完全被排斥于大会的领导之外，并被剥夺了在大会上的表决权。
    党的第五次全国代表大会在实际上没有解决任何问题。大会闭幕以后，党的领导仍然在右倾机会主义分子的把持之下，陈独秀的错误路线更发展到登峰造极的地步，这就使党在1927年7月武汉国民党和蒋介石实行反革命合流的时候陷于软弱无力的地位，而造成第一次国内革命战争的惨痛失败。
    第六次全国代表大会
    中国共产党的第六次全国代表大会是1928年6月在苏联首都莫斯科召开的，这次大会是在共产国际的指示和领导之下举行的，出席大会的正式代表共有八十四人，代表着四万多个党员。
    当时的国内形势是：1927年革命失败以后，蒋介石等新军阀在中国建立起血腥统治，工农革命力量受到极大摧残，革命暂时转入低潮，中国共产党领导中国人民进入了第二次国内革命战争时期。这时，革命力量被迫从公开转入地下，从城市移向农村，共产党领导农民进行土地革命斗争。1927年冬季，在毛泽东同志领导下，中国第一个农村革命根据地——井冈山根据地建立起来了，中国工农红军也正式组成了。毛泽东同志开辟了中国革命唯一正确的发展道路。
    六次大会的中心任务，是总结第一次国内革命战争的经验，分析当时的革命形势，确定党的方针和路线。大会讨论和通过了政治决议案、苏维埃政权（即工农民主政权）组织问题决议案、土地问题决议案、农民问题决议案、职工运动决议案和新党章，并选举了新的中央委员会。
    这次大会的重要功绩是：
    一、正确地肯定了中国社会是半殖民地半封建社会，确定中国现阶段的革命依然是资产阶级民主革命，革命的总任务是建立反帝反封建的工农民主专政，并制定了民主革命的十大纲领。
    二、正确地指出当时国内的政治形势是处在两个革命高潮之间，指出革命发展的不平衡，指出党在当时的总任务不是进攻，不是普遍地组织起义，而是争取群众。
    三、进行了两条战线的斗争，清算了陈独秀的右倾机会主义，也批判了当时存在的“左”倾盲动主义。
    大会所制定的路线基本上是正确的。
    六次代表大会的错误和缺点是：对于中国民主革命的长期性，中间阶级的两面性和反动势力的内部矛盾，缺乏正确的估计；对于第一次国内革命战争失败后党所需要的策略上的退却和对于农村革命根据地的重要性，也缺乏必要的认识。大会的这些缺点，曾妨碍了党内“左”倾错误的彻底纠正，以致在大会以后，党的领导仍然掌握在“左”倾分子手中。
    毛泽东同志没有出席这次大会，但大会选出了他为党中央委员会委员。大会以后，毛泽东同志不但发展了大会路线的正确方面，并从理论上和实践上正确地解决了许多为这次大会所不曾解决和不曾正确解决的问题。
    第七次全国代表大会
    中国共产党的第七次全国代表大会是1945年4月23日至6月11日在延安召开的，出席大会的正式代表有五百四十七人，候补代表有二百零八人，代表着一百二十一万党员。
    当时的形势是：在国际上，苏联红军已迫近柏林，希特勒德国将被击败；东方的法西斯日本也处于盟军的围攻之中，世界反法西斯战争已处于胜利前夜。在国内，国民党反动派继续消极抗日、积极反共的反动政策，严重地阻碍中国抗日力量的统一，并使中国的内战危机日趋严重。这时，全国人民一致要求立即改组腐败透顶的国民党政府和国民党统帅部，成立民主的联合政府和联合统帅部，以克服危机，加强抗战力量，迎接抗日大反攻。
    在七次大会上毛泽东同志作了“论联合政府”的政治报告；朱德同志作了“论解放区战场”的军事报告；刘少奇同志作了关于修改党章的报告。大会通过了新党章，选举了党的中央委员会。
    在毛泽东同志所作的政治报告中，科学地分析了当时的国际和国内形势，明确规定了党和全国人民斗争的任务，详细地规定了打败日本侵略者和解放全中国的一般纲领和具体纲领。毛泽东同志指出中国存在着两个前途：一个是使中国回到内战、不独立、不自主、不民主、不统一、不富强的老状态里去的黑暗的前途，这是中国反动派和外国帝国主义分子所希望的；另一个是将中国建设成为一个独立、自由、民主、统一和富强的新国家的光明的前途，这是中国广大人民和外国进步分子所希望的。党和中国人民的任务是：竭尽全力去反对第一个前途，争取第二个前途。毛泽东同志号召全党重视城市工作，将沦陷区的工作提到和解放区的工作同等重要的地位，以便在大反攻到来的时候，夺取大城市，接管大城市。
    大会根据毛泽东同志的政治报告，制定了党的唯一正确的政治路线，这就是：“放手发动群众，壮大人民力量，在我党的领导下，打败日本侵略者，解放全国人民，建立一个新民主主义的中国。”
    在朱德同志所作的军事报告中，全面地总结了党领导武装斗争和人民军队建设的经验，并确定了解放区战场今后的军事任务：“八路军、新四军要准备在抗战后期实行从抗日游击战争到抗日正规战争的战略转变……以迎接这抗日大反攻的战斗。”
    刘少奇同志所作的关于修改党章的报告和大会通过的新党章，全面地总结了党的建设方面的经验，正确地规定了党的组织路线。
    大会最后经过充分的酝酿和民主讨论，选出了以毛泽东同志为首的党的第七届中央委员会。这届中央委员会同以前各届比较，是最完善和最有威信的一届中央委员会，它集中了全党和全国人民的智慧，依据马克思列宁主义的理论和党的集体领导的原则，保证了党的领导的正确性。
    大会表现了全党的空前团结和一致。这种团结是在马克思列宁主义原则下的团结，是在广泛发展自我批评和党内民主基础上的团结。因此毛泽东同志称这次大会“是团结的模范，是自我批评的模范，又是党内民主的模范。”
    这样，党的第七次全国代表大会就不仅制定了一条完全正确的政治路线，而且还选出了能够团结全党和全国人民来彻底实现这条政治路线的中央领导机关。这是党和中国革命胜利的保证。
    大会闭幕之后，中国共产党的全体党员和全国人民在党中央和毛泽东同志的领导之下，向日本侵略者及其在中国的走狗展开了更为猛烈的斗争。1945年8月8日，苏联对日宣战，在苏联红军的大力援助下，抗日战争很快地取得了最后胜利。接着由于国民党反动派又发动了内战，猛烈进攻解放区，党领导人民被迫举行了解放战争，终于推翻了国民党的反动统治，建立了光荣伟大的中华人民共和国。	中共中央高级党校中共党史教研室  肖一平　张弓编写（附图片）
