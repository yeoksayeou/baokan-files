    Hejian County Establishes Disaster Area Supply Office
    Swiftly Transports Supplies to Disaster Areas
    (Our Dispatch) Under the leadership of the Hejian County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Hebei Province's Hejian County has established a disaster area supply office. In addition to dispatching cadres from the Grain Bureau to set up temporary grain sales points, this office also organized the County Supply and Marketing Cooperative to establish eleven temporary supply points.

    After the disaster occurred, the Hejian County Committee immediately convened a meeting of relevant personnel to ascertain the county's material reserve situation and made rapid and appropriate adjustments to the various supply points. The Grain Bureau transferred sufficient flour, rice, millet flour, corn flour, and other grains. The Supply and Marketing Cooperative, as well as the department store and petroleum company, also transferred umbrellas, oilcloth, tung oil, matches, batteries, and kerosene. In the supply of major materials such as grain and coal, they also adopted the method of credit sales. In addition to setting up temporary supply points, they also organized mobile supply teams to deliver goods to villages surrounded by water and to the dikes.

    河间县组成灾区物资供应办公室
    迅速地把物资调运到受灾地区
    本报讯　在中共河间县委的领导下，河北省河间县组成了灾区物资供应办公室。这个办公室除抽调粮食局干部设立了临时售粮点外，还组织县供销社建立了十一个临时供应点。
    灾情发生后，河间县委马上召集有关人员开会，摸清了全县物资储备情况，对各供应点进行了迅速而适当的调配。粮食局调运了足够的面粉、大米、小米面、玉米面等。供销社和百货、石油公司也调运了雨伞、油布、桐油、火柴、电池和煤油。在粮食和煤等主要物资的供应上，还采取了赊销的办法。除了设置临时供应点以外，他们还组织了流动供应小组，到被水围困的村庄和堤坡上送货。
