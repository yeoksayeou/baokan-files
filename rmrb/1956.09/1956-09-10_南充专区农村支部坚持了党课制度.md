    Rural Party branches in Nanchong Prefecture, Sichuan Province, used to have a party class education system that was intermittent and never regular. However, since February of this year, this situation has changed significantly. About 80% of the 611 rural branches in the prefecture's twelve counties (cities) have adhered to a regular party class education system. According to statistics from March to June of this year, most branches had four or five party classes; the most had seven; and the fewest had two. Why have Party committees at all levels been able to maintain regular party class education for the past six months? This is mainly due to the following aspects:
    1.  Compile party class materials in a timely manner based on current work tasks.
    In the past, due to the lack of popular teaching materials, coupled with the instructors' failure to study the texts thoroughly and their habit of "reading directly from the book" during lectures, the党员 listening to the lectures found them boring and dull, making it difficult to maintain the party class system in rural branches. Therefore, compiling easy-to-understand teaching materials that can address current practical work and the ideological problems of party members has become very necessary. Over the past six months, we have felt that in order to closely integrate the compiled teaching materials with the current ideological reality of party members, we must go deep down, collect various materials, and enrich the content of the teaching materials, instead of "building a car behind closed doors" in the office. The Yilong County Party Committee organized a working group as early as December last year, focusing on Nantuo and Ma'an townships, to deeply understand the ideological situation of party members and activists from the practical work of establishing cooperatives, consolidating cooperatives, and leading production, and compile teaching materials based on these situations and their level of awareness. The Propaganda Department of the Prefectural Party Committee also went to Xixing Township in Nanchong County in February of this year to collect materials for compiling party class teaching materials. After writing, it is generally tried out in one branch first, and then revised based on the effects of the trial and the opinions of the party members, and then sent to the county Party Committee for review before being printed and distributed to each branch. The advantage of compiling teaching materials in this way is that it can provide branches with more practical teaching materials in a timely manner, and the content of the teaching materials can be closely combined with the actual ideological situation of party members in each period. For example, the party class teaching materials after February of this year took the National Agricultural Development Program (draft) as the basic content. In order to enable the party class to carry out education targeting the unhealthy ideological tendencies of party members, in this year's establishment of cooperatives, the erroneous ideas of some party members who were unwilling to absorb poor peasants into the cooperatives and who were not enthusiastic about leading the cooperative movement were criticized. In the spring plowing production and consolidation of cooperative work, education was conducted targeting the erroneous ideas of some party members who did not invest money, made a fuss about reputation and status after expanding and merging cooperatives, and did not accept new production technologies. In this way, the content of each lesson has a certain ideological and combative nature, and can grasp and solve one or two major problems, so that the content is not empty and monotonous. However, the contents seem a little strained and far-fetched in content if they are combined with the basic knowledge of the Party. In view of this situation, we have adopted the method of explaining the current work tasks and policies and the basic knowledge of the Party in a cross manner, that is, after giving one or two party classes mainly on work tasks, we will specifically give a party class mainly on the basic knowledge of the Party. This avoids the bias of not talking about the basic knowledge of the Party or forcibly combining the two contents together.
    2.  Expand the ranks of branch instructors, pay attention to guiding instructors in giving lectures, and improve the quality of party class education.
    First of all, correctly selecting and organizing branch instructors is the key to ensuring the persistence of a regular party class education system. Branch instructors are generally divided into two types: fixed and part-time: fixed instructors are recommended and hired from among the party members of the branch and approved by the county Party Committee; part-time instructors are designated by the county and district Party committees and are served by county and district party member cadres, and are also approved by the county Party Committee. Now the number of fixed branch instructors in the entire prefecture has increased from one to two or three per branch. According to statistics from Yilong, Guang'an, Yingshan, Yuechi, and Xichong counties, 260 township branches have been equipped with 762 instructors, an average of nearly three per township. These two types of instructors have their own strengths and weaknesses. Part-time instructors generally have a high level and better lecture effects, but they have high mobility and it is difficult to guarantee the regularity of party classes; fixed instructors generally have a low level and the quality of lectures is not high at the beginning, but the advantage is that they can guarantee the regularity of lectures, and they can often carry out education according to the ideological situation of party members and non-party activists.
    Secondly, the leadership should pay attention to helping instructors prepare lessons. This is a very important issue in improving the quality of party classes. In addition to providing instructors with reference materials on time, the lesson preparation method also organizes instruction. The county and district recruit cadres to form a working group and regularly instruct the branch instructors. There are three ways to instruct: First, instructors from one or two districts are gathered together, and branch instructors sent by the county or county and district committees instruct them, and combine with the ideological situation of party members to discuss, so that each instructor deeply understands the spirit of the teaching materials and can grasp the center of the teaching materials. The second is to gather instructors in key township branches by district, and the instructors sent by the county and district demonstrate lectures to the party members of this township. After the lectures, other instructors are organized to discuss on the spot, raise questions about the content of the teaching materials and the advantages and disadvantages of the lectures, and make necessary revisions. Third, before the lecture, the branch propaganda committee is responsible for organizing the branch instructors in the township to collectively prepare lessons based on the teaching materials and the problems existing in the ideology and work of the party members. According to the understanding of 55 general branches in Guang'an County, only one branch instructor did not prepare lessons before giving lectures, and all other instructors prepared lessons. We feel that doing so not only improves the instructors' lecturing ability, but also improves and improves the quality of the lectures.
    3.  Properly arranging class time can ensure that party class education is carried out regularly.
    The situation in rural areas is that time is tight and there are many tasks. If time is not well arranged, party class education will fall through. Therefore, the branches have made unified arrangements for the class time, and paid attention to obeying production and facilitating party members to attend classes according to the characteristics of rural work and the natural environment in which party members live. Generally, the method of taking more classes during slack farming seasons, less classes during busy farming seasons, more classes when needed, and fewer classes at ordinary times is adopted. In order to take care of the scattered residences of party members, the method of taking classes in branch units is also adopted.
    4.  Strengthening the leadership and management of branch education is the key to ensuring the regularity of the party class system.
    First of all, the importance attached by Party committees at all levels to the leadership of branch education work is the central link in the ability of branch education work to persist. All places that have been able to adhere to the party class system have proven this point. The reason why the Yilong County Party class system has persisted for more than a year is because the county Party Committee attaches importance to it. The county Party Committee not only regularly urges the County Party Committee Propaganda Department, the District Party Committee, and the Branch to strengthen inspections, but also regularly proposes educational content, organizes a branch education working group, and establishes key townships for branch education work to strengthen the specific leadership of party class education work. Secondly, the propaganda department must take the initiative to win the leadership of the Party committee, and according to the Party committee's work arrangements for a period of time, actively arrange branch education work, so that branch education work is subordinate to the entire work. Finally, to do a good job in branch education work, like other work, there must be an overall plan and a specific arrangement for a period of time to ensure the regularity of branch education.

    南充专区农村支部坚持了党课制度
    牛天鸾
    四川省南充专区农村党支部的党课教育，过去总是时断时续，始终不能经常起来。可是，今年二月以后，这种情况有了很大改变，全区十二个县（市）的六百一十一个农村支部，已有80％左右的支部坚持了经常的党课教育制度。据今年3月至6月的统计，一般的支部都上了四、五次党课；最多的上了七次；最少的也上了两次。为什么这半年多来各级党委能够坚持经常性的党课教育？主要是做好了以下几方面的工作：
    一、根据当前工作任务，及时编写党课教材。
    过去由于缺乏通俗教材，加上教员没有很好钻研课文，讲课时“照本宣读”，这样，使听课的党员感到枯燥乏味，农村支部的党课制度就难以坚持。于是编写一些通俗易懂又能解决当前实际工作和党员思想问题的教材，就成为很必要的了。半年多来，我们感到：为了使编写的教材能够密切结合当前党员的思想实际，就必须深入下去，搜集各种材料，充实教材内容，而不能坐在办公室内“闭门造车”。仪陇县委从去年12月就组织了工作组，以南图，马鞍两乡为重点，从建社、巩固社、领导生产的实际工作中，去深入了解党员、积极分子的思想情况，根据这些情况和他们的觉悟程度进行编写教材。地委宣传部从今年2月起，也深入到南充县西兴乡去搜集材料编写党课教材。写好以后，一般是先在一个支部进行试讲，根据试讲效果和党员意见加以修改，送县委审查后印发给各支部。这样编写教材的好处是：能及时供给支部比较切合实际的教材，教材内容能与各个时期的党员思想实际紧密地结合起来。如今年2月以后的党课教材就以全国农业发展纲要（草案）为基本内容。为了使得党课能够针对党员的不良思想倾向进行教育，在今年建社中，着重批判了某些党员不愿吸收贫农入社、领导合作化运动劲头不大等错误思想；在春耕生产和巩固合作社工作中，又针对一些党员有钱不投资、扩社并社后闹名誉地位、不接受新的生产技术等错误思想进行了教育。这样，使每一课内容都具有一定的思想性和战斗性，都能抓住和解决一两个主要问题，内容不致空泛单调。但这样编写的教材，在内容上如和党的基本知识结合，在某些地方就显得有些生硬和牵强。根据这种情况，我们采取了将当前工作任务和政策与党的基本知识交叉进行讲解的办法，即是讲一次或两次以工作任务为主要内容的党课后，就专门上一次以党的基本知识为主要内容的党课。这就避免了不讲党的基本知识或将两个内容并在一起生硬结合的偏向。
    二、扩大支部教员队伍，注意辅导教员讲课和提高党课教育的质量。
    首先是正确选拔和组织支部教员，这是保证坚持经常性的党课教育制度的关键。支部教员一般分为固定的和兼职的两种：固定教员是在支部党员中推选和聘请的，并经县委批准；兼职教员是由县、区委指定县、区党员干部担任的，也由县委批准。现在全区固定的支部教员，已由原来的每个支部一人增加到二至三人。据仪儱、广安、营山、岳池、西充五县的统计，二百六十个乡支部已配备了教员七百六十二人，平均每乡将近三人。这两种教员各有长处和短处，兼职教员一般水平高，讲课效果好些，但流动性大，很难保证党课的经常性；固定教员一般水平低，开始讲课质量不高，但好处是能够保证讲课的经常性，并且经常能够按照党员和非党积极分子的思想情况进行教育。
    其次，领导方面应注意帮助教员备课。这是提高党课质量的一个很重要的问题。备课的办法，除按时供给教员参考资料外，还组织了传授，由县区抽调干部组成工作组，定期向支部教员传授。传授的办法有三种：一是将一两个区的教员集中起来，由县上派去的支部教员或县、区委员进行传授，并结合党员思想情况研究讨论，使每个教员深刻领会教材精神，能够抓住教材中心。二是以区为单位把教员集中到重点乡支部，由县、区派去的教员向这个乡的党员作示范讲课，讲课后就地组织其他教员讨论，提出教材内容上的问题和讲课中的优缺点，作必要的修正。三是讲课前由支部宣传委员负责组织本乡支部教员，根据教材结合党员的思想和工作上存在的问题，集体进行备课。根据广安县五十五个总支的了解，只有一个支部的教员讲课没有备课，其他教员都备课了。这样做我们感到不仅提高了教员的讲课能力，同时，也提高与改进了讲课质量。
    三、妥善安排上课时间，就能保证党课教育经常进行。农村的情况是时间紧，任务多，不很好安排时间，党课教育就会落空。因此，各支部对上课的时间都进行了统一安排，并根据农村工作和党员居住的自然环境等特点，注意了服从生产和便利党员听课。一般采取了农闲多上，农忙少上，需要的时候多上，平时就少上的办法。为了照顾党员住地分散，还采用了以分支为单位的上课办法。
    四、加强对支部教育的领导和管理，是保证党课制度经常化的关键。
    首先各级党委对支部教育工作领导的重视，是支部教育工作能够坚持下来的中心环节。凡是能够坚持党课制度的地方，都证明了这一点。仪陇县党课制度之所以坚持了一年多，就是因为县委的重视，县委不仅经常督促县委宣传部、区委、支部加强检查，而且经常提出教育内容，组织了支部教育工作组，建立了支部教育工作的重点乡，以加强对党课教育工作的具体领导。其次，是宣传部要主动争取党委的领导，根据党委一个时期的工作布置，主动的安排支部教育工作，使支部教育工作服从于整个工作。最后，作好支部教育工作，也和其他工作一样，必须要有一个全面计划和一个时期的具体安排，才能保证支部教育的经常化。
