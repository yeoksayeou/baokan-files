Chairman Zhou, esteemed members:

Recently, due to the further threats and provocations against Egypt by the United Kingdom, France, and the United States, the situation in the Suez Canal has become more complex and serious. The State Council deems it necessary to report to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on the latest developments in the Suez Canal issue and to explain the government's position on this matter.

The Suez Canal issue involves two aspects: Egypt's inviolable sovereignty over the Suez Canal and freedom of navigation through the Suez Canal. Although these two aspects are closely related, they must not be confused. The Suez Canal is an integral part of Egypt; The Suez Canal Company is an Egyptian company, subject to Egyptian laws and customs. Therefore, Egypt has every right to nationalize the Suez Canal Company. This is a just action taken by Egypt to safeguard its sovereignty and independence. As for the freedom of navigation through the Suez Canal, it has long been stipulated in the 1888 Constantinople Convention. After the Egyptian government nationalized the Suez Canal Company, it not only repeatedly declared, but also proved with facts, that the Egyptian government guaranteed the freedom of navigation through the Suez Canal. The Egyptian government even suggested convening an international conference with broad participation of relevant countries to review the Constantinople Convention and to consider concluding an agreement by all these countries to reaffirm and guarantee the freedom of navigation through the Suez Canal. The attitude of the Egyptian government towards these two aspects of the Suez Canal issue is completely correct and blameless. The Chinese government fully supports this attitude of the Egyptian government.

However, the United Kingdom and France have adopted a completely opposite attitude. They deliberately confuse the issue of the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company with the issue of freedom of navigation through the canal, attempting to use the alleged threat to freedom of navigation as an excuse to maintain their colonial privileges. They verbally acknowledge or dare not deny Egypt's sovereignty over the Suez Canal, but in reality, they use economic pressure and military threats, and even risky provocative plans, in an attempt to force Egypt to give up its sovereignty over the Suez Canal, or forcibly seize Egypt's sovereignty over the Suez Canal. They pay lip service to their concern for the freedom of navigation through the Suez Canal, but in reality, they refuse to conduct any peaceful negotiations with Egypt, and even use the means of forcing foreign technical personnel of the Suez Canal Company to resign, while deliberately dispatching a large number of ships requesting passage through the Suez Canal, plotting to sabotage the freedom of navigation of the canal. Although the United States sometimes talks about peaceful solutions, it actually supports the actions of the United Kingdom and France in carrying out military threats and infringing upon Egyptian sovereignty, and has been using and strengthening these actions for the purpose of its own expansion in the Middle East. It is these actions of the United Kingdom, France, and the United States that have created and aggravated the tension in the Suez Canal situation.

As everyone knows, in the August London Conference, which they unilaterally decided to convene, the United Kingdom, France, and the United States insisted on the plan of international control of the Suez Canal, also known as the Dulles Plan. This plan exposed that their convening of the London Conference was not for peaceful consultations based on respect for Egyptian sovereignty, but to use the conference to achieve the purpose of infringing upon Egyptian sovereignty. Such a plan cannot only not lead to a peaceful solution to the Suez Canal issue, but can only make the solution to this issue more difficult. In order to prevent the door to a peaceful solution to the Suez Canal issue from being closed, India, the Soviet Union, Indonesia, and Ceylon have made great efforts. India also put forward a plan that respects Egypt's sovereignty over the Suez Canal and is sufficient to guarantee freedom of navigation through the canal. This plan was supported by the Soviet Union, Indonesia, and Ceylon. However, Western countries rejected this plan. Thus, the London Conference ended without reaching a unanimous agreement. The attitude of our government towards the London Conference has been clearly expressed in the statement of August 15 and the note to the Egyptian government on September 17.

After the London Conference, the countries supporting the Dulles Plan sent a five-country committee to Cairo, attempting to impose this plan on the Egyptian government. At the same time, the former Suez Canal Company, which had lost any legal status, openly declared that if Egypt could not reach an agreement with the five-country committee on the establishment of an institution for international control of the Suez Canal, they would order the withdrawal of all non-Egyptian pilots and other staff, while the United Kingdom and France, with the support of the United States, intensified their aggressive military preparations and assembled a large number of troops on the island of Cyprus near Egypt. However, even under such circumstances, the Egyptian government, which insisted on peaceful consultations, still received the five-country committee in good faith and patiently listened to their explanation of the Dulles Plan.

No matter how it is interpreted, the purpose of the Dulles Plan is very clear, that is, to take the Suez Canal away from Egypt. Egyptian President Nasser pointed out solemnly in his letter to the five-country committee on September 9, 1956: "It is hard to imagine a greater provocation to the Egyptian people than this action. An action of this nature is not only self-defeating, but also has the nature of causing conflict, misunderstanding, and constant disputes. In other words, this will not be the end of the dispute, but the beginning of the dispute." Therefore, it is only natural that the Egyptian government cannot accept the Dulles Plan.

However, the Egyptian government did not give up its efforts to seek a peaceful solution because of this. On September 10, in a note to various governments, the Egyptian government suggested taking immediate steps to organize a negotiating body sufficient to represent the different opinions of the countries using the Suez Canal, in order to solve the problem of freedom of navigation in the Suez Canal through peaceful negotiations. The Chinese government has warmly supported this suggestion of the Egyptian government in its note to the Egyptian government on September 17. According to information from the Egyptian side, more than twenty countries have now expressed their support for this suggestion of the Egyptian government.

Contrary to Egypt's persistent pursuit of a peaceful solution, the British government announced on September 12 that the United Kingdom, France, and the United States would form a so-called "Canal Users Association" in an attempt to openly deprive Egypt of its sacred sovereignty and forcibly manage the Suez Canal. Subsequently, the vast majority of non-Egyptian technical personnel of the Suez Canal Company announced their collective resignation under the duress and enticement of the United Kingdom and France. Now, the United Kingdom, France, and the United States are holding a meeting in London to specifically discuss this adventurous plan to forcibly manage the Suez Canal. Indian Prime Minister Nehru justly pointed out in a statement to the Indian People's House on September 13 that the actions the governments of the United Kingdom, France, and the United States "intend to take are not the result of agreement, cooperation, and consent, but are to be taken unilaterally, and therefore have the nature of imposition and decision." He said that this "step to manage the canal without the consent and cooperation of the Egyptian government is deliberately creating great difficulties for peaceful avenues, and this step also contains a serious danger of causing conflict." The Soviet government strongly condemned the provocative plan of the United Kingdom, France, and the United States in a statement on September 15 as "artificially creating events as an excuse to take military action against Egypt," therefore, the Soviet Union issued due warnings to the United Kingdom, France, and the United States. Both India and the Soviet Union firmly advocate seeking a solution to the issue of freedom of navigation through the road of peaceful consultation. This undoubtedly conforms to the wishes of all peace-loving countries and peoples.

The plan of the United Kingdom, France, and the United States to forcibly manage the Suez Canal is a complete violation of the United Nations Charter. As the Egyptian government pointed out in its note to the President of the United Nations Security Council on September 17, this plan is to establish an organization with self-appointed powers on the territory of an independent member state of the United Nations, without the consent of that country. To realize such a plan that infringes upon Egypt's territorial integrity and sovereignty clearly means the use of force against Egypt. This will not only be an aggression against Egypt, but also a serious threat to international peace and security. All countries that truly abide by the United Nations Charter cannot but bear the obligation to actively prevent the further development of this serious situation.

The armed intervention plan of the United Kingdom and France, with the support of the United States, to infringe upon Egypt's sovereignty and dignity is not only a serious provocation to the Egyptian people, but also a serious provocation to all Arab countries, Asian and African countries, and all peace-loving and justice-upholding countries and peoples in the world. The imperialists have obviously forgotten that this is a new era in which socialist countries are growing stronger, national independent countries have achieved many victories, and world peace forces have unprecedented development. If the United Kingdom and France, with the support of the United States, continue to act willfully and dare to carry out war provocations against Egypt, then it can be asserted that the heroic Egyptian people, with the support of all peace-loving and justice-upholding countries and peoples, will surely be able to inflict heavy blows on the aggressors. Many countries currently participating in the London Conference have expressed their unwillingness to participate in plans to use force against Egypt. Some countries have also emphasized that their participation in the conference does not mean that they have agreed to the plan of the United Kingdom, France, and the United States to organize the so-called "Canal Users Association." Even so, we still believe that it is necessary to remind the countries invited to participate in the London Conference to guard against falling into one trap or another set up by the United Kingdom, France, and the United States in order to infringe upon Egyptian sovereignty and conspire to sabotage the freedom of navigation of the canal.

It is very clear that without the support of the United States, the United Kingdom and France would not be able to implement this adventurous plan to forcibly manage the Suez Canal. But if the United Kingdom and France think that with the support of the United States they can maintain their colonial interests in the Middle East, then they are wrong. In a war adventure that offers no way out for any imperialist aggressors, the United States will inevitably seize the opportunity to first seize the colonial interests of the United Kingdom and France in the Middle East, just as it did in South Vietnam. In this case, the United Kingdom and France will not gain any benefit, and in the end, they can only lose everything they still have.

China and Egypt, together with the other twenty-seven Asian and African countries, once unanimously declared at the Bandung Conference that the scourge of colonialism should be eradicated quickly. The Chinese people resolutely support the completely legitimate action of the Egyptian government to take back the Suez Canal Company. The Chinese people cannot remain indifferent to any action that infringes upon Egyptian sovereignty and carries out armed intervention against Egypt. The Chinese people stand firmly on the side of the Egyptian people together with all peace-loving and justice-upholding people in the world. The Egyptian people will surely receive the full support of the Chinese people in their great struggle to safeguard national independence and state sovereignty.

The Chinese government firmly advocates resolving the issue of freedom of navigation in the Suez Canal through peaceful consultation on the basis of respecting Egypt's sovereignty and dignity. As everyone can see, as far as Egypt is concerned, the door to peaceful consultation is open. We firmly oppose any war provocation plan that infringes upon Egyptian sovereignty and disrupts canal navigation. If the United Kingdom, France, and the United States are truly concerned about the freedom of navigation of the canal, they should rein in their horses at the edge of the cliff, abandon their plan to forcibly manage the Suez Canal, and return to the road of peaceful consultation. There is no other way.

    关于苏彝士运河问题的报告
    （1956年9月20日在全国人民代表大会常委会第四十六次会议上）
    周恩来主席，各位委员：
    最近，由于英、法、美三国进一步对埃及进行威胁和挑衅，苏彝士运河的局势已经更加复杂化和严重化了。国务院认为有必要向全国人民代表大会常务委员会报告苏彝士运河问题最近的发展，并且说明政府在这个问题上的立场。
    苏彝士运河问题包括两个方面，那就是，埃及对苏彝士运河的不可侵犯的主权和苏彝士运河的航行自由。这两个方面尽管有密切的联系，但是绝不可以混为一谈。苏彝士运河是埃及不可分割的一部分；苏彝士运河公司是一个埃及公司，受埃及法律和习惯的管辖。因此，埃及完全有权把苏彝士运河公司收归国有。这是埃及为了维护自己的主权和独立而采取的正义行动。至于苏彝士运河的航行自由，1888年的君士坦丁堡公约早已作出了规定。埃及政府把苏彝士运河公司收归国有以后，不仅一再声明，并且用事实证明，埃及政府保证了苏彝士运河的航行自由。埃及政府甚至还建议召开由有关国家广泛参加的国际会议，来审查君士坦丁堡公约，并且考虑由所有这些国家缔结一个协定来重新肯定和保证苏彝士运河的航行自由。埃及政府对于苏彝士运河问题的这两个方面所采取的态度，都是完全正确的，无可指谪的。中国政府完全支持埃及政府的这种态度。
    但是英、法两国却采取了完全相反的态度。他们故意把苏彝士运河公司国有化的问题同这条运河的航行自由问题混淆起来，企图以运河航行自由受到威胁为借口，来维持他们的殖民主义特权。他们在口头上承认或者不敢否认埃及对苏彝士运河的主权，但是实际上却用经济压力和武力威胁，甚至用冒险的挑衅计划，企图迫使埃及放弃对苏彝士运河的主权，或者强行夺取埃及对苏彝士运河的主权。他们口口声声说关心苏彝士运河的航行自由，但是实际上却拒绝同埃及进行任何和平协商，甚至用强迫苏彝士运河公司外籍技术人员离职的手段，同时故意调遣大批船只要求通过苏彝士运河，阴谋破坏运河的航行自由。美国虽然有时也高谈和平解决问题，但是实际上却支持英、法两国进行武力威胁和侵犯埃及主权的行动，并且为了它自己在中东进行扩张的目的，一直在利用和加强英、法的这种行动。正是英、法、美三国的这些行动，造成了并且加剧了苏彝士运河局势的紧张。
    大家知道，英、法、美三国在他们片面决定召开的8月伦敦会议中，坚持国际管制苏彝士运河的方案，也就是所谓杜勒斯方案。这个方案暴露了他们召开伦敦会议不是为了在尊重埃及主权的基础上进行和平协商，而是要利用这个会议来实现侵犯埃及主权的目的。这样的方案，不仅不能导致苏彝士运河问题的和平解决，而且只能使这个问题的解决更加困难起来。为了使和平解决苏彝士运河问题的大门不致关闭，印度、苏联、印度尼西亚和锡兰等国做了很大的努力。印度并且提出了一个尊重埃及对苏彝士运河的主权和足以保证运河航行自由的方案。这个方案得到了苏联、印度尼西亚和锡兰的支持。但是西方国家拒绝了这个方案。这样，伦敦会议就在不能达到一致协议的情况下宣告结束。我国政府对于伦敦会议的态度，已经在8月15日的声明和9月17日给埃及政府的照会中做了明确的表示。
    伦敦会议结束后，支持杜勒斯方案的国家派遣了一个五国委员会到开罗去，企图把这个方案强加在埃及政府身上。与此同时，已经失去了任何合法地位的前苏彝士运河公司公开声明，如果埃及不能同五国委员会就建立国际管制苏彝士运河的机构问题达成协议，他们就将下令撤回所有非埃及籍的领航人员和其他职员，而英、法两国更在美国支持下加紧侵略性的军事准备，在邻近埃及的塞浦路斯岛结集了大批军队。但是即使在这样的情况下，坚持和平协商的埃及政府仍然善意地接待了五国委员会，并且耐心地听取了他们对杜勒斯方案的解释。
    不管作怎样的解释，杜勒斯方案的目的是非常清楚的，那就是，要从埃及手中夺走苏彝士运河。埃及纳赛尔总统在1956年9月9日给五国委员会的信中严正地指出：“很难想像有比这个行动更大的对埃及人民的挑衅。这种性质的行动不仅是自取失败的，同时也是具有引起冲突、误解和不断纠纷的性质的行动。换句话说，这将不是纠纷的结束，而是纠纷的开始。”因此，埃及政府不能接受杜勒斯的方案是理所当然的。
    但是埃及政府并没有因此而放弃它寻求和平解决的努力。9月10日，埃及政府在给各国政府的照会中，建议立即采取步骤组织一个足以代表使用苏彝士运河各国的不同意见的谈判机构，以便用和平谈判的办法，来解决有关苏彝士运河航行自由的问题。中国政府已经在9月17日给埃及政府的照会中，热烈地支持埃及政府的这一建议。根据埃及方面的消息，现在已经有二十几个国家表示了支持埃及政府的这一建议。
    同埃及这种坚持不懈地寻求和平解决的态度相反，英国政府在9月12日宣布，英、法、美三国将组成一个所谓“运河使用国协会”，企图公然剥夺埃及的神圣主权，强行管理苏彝士运河。接着，苏彝士运河公司的绝大多数非埃及籍的技术人员就在英、法威逼利诱下宣布集体离职。现在，英、法、美三国正在伦敦召开会议，对这个强行管理苏彝士运河的冒险计划进行具体商谈。印度尼赫鲁总理9月13日在印度人民院发表的声明中公正地指出，英、法、美三国政府“打算采取的行动，不是协议、合作和同意的结果，而是要片面地采取的，因此具有强加的、决定的性质”。他说，这种“不得埃及政府的同意和合作就对运河实行管理的步骤是有意要给和平途径造成极大的困难，并且这种步骤还包含着引起冲突的严重危险”。苏联政府在9月15日的声明中强烈地谴责了英、法、美三国的挑衅计划是要“人为地制造事件，以作为采取武力反对埃及的借口”，因此，苏联向英、法、美三国提出了应有的警告。印度和苏联都坚决主张通过和平协商的道路谋求运河航行自由问题的解决。这无疑是符合于所有爱好和平的国家和人民的愿望的。
    英、法、美三国企图强行管理苏彝士运河的计划是彻底违反联合国宪章的。正如埃及政府在9月17日给联合国安全理事会主席的照会中所指出的，这个计划是要在联合国的一个自主的会员国的领土上，不经该国的同意，设立一个拥有自封的权限的组织。要实现这样一个侵犯埃及的领土完整和主权的计划，显然就意味着对埃及使用武力。这不仅将是对埃及的侵略，而且也严重地威胁国际的和平和安全。一切真正遵守联合国宪章的国家，都不能不担负起积极制止这种严重局势进一步发展的义务。
    英、法两国在美国支持下企图侵犯埃及的主权和尊严的武装干涉计划，不仅是对埃及人民的严重挑衅，而且也是对所有阿拉伯国家、亚非国家和世界上一切爱好和平和正义的国家和人民的严重挑衅。帝国主义者显然忘记了，现在已经是社会主义国家日益壮大、民族独立国家取得许多胜利和世界和平力量有了空前发展的新时代。如果英、法两国在美国支持下继续一意孤行，胆敢对埃及实行战争挑衅，那么可以断言，英勇的埃及人民在一切爱好和平和正义的国家和人民的支持下，必将能够使侵略者遭到沉重的打击。目前参加伦敦会议的许多国家已经表示不愿意参预对埃及使用武力的计划。有些国家还强调，他们参加会议并不等于已经同意英、法、美三国组织所谓“运河使用国协会”的计划。即使如此，我们仍然认为有必要提醒应邀参加伦敦会议的国家，严防掉进英、法、美三国为了侵犯埃及主权和阴谋破坏运河的航行自由而设置的这一种或者那一种的陷井。
    很显然，没有美国的支持，英、法两国是不可能把这个强行管理苏彝士运河的冒险计划付之实施的。但是如果英、法两国以为有了美国这样的支持就可以保持住他们在中东的殖民利益，那么他们就错了。在一个对于所有帝国主义侵略者不可能有任何出路的战争冒险中，美国将不可避免地首先要乘机夺取英、法在中东的殖民利益，正像它在南越所做的一样。在这种情况下，英、法将得不到任何好处，最后，只能失去他们现在还有的一切。
    中国和埃及同其他二十七个亚非国家一起曾经在万隆会议上一致宣布，殖民主义的祸害应该迅速根除。中国人民坚决支持埃及政府收回苏彝士运河公司的完全合法的行动。任何侵犯埃及主权和对于埃及实行武装干涉的行动，中国人民都不能置若罔闻。中国人民同全世界一切爱好和平和正义的人民一起，坚决地站在埃及人民这一边。埃及人民在维护民族独立和国家主权的伟大斗争中定会得到中国人民的全力支持。
    中国政府坚决主张在尊重埃及的主权和尊严的基础上，通过和平协商解决苏彝士运河航行自由的问题。大家可以看到，就埃及而言，和平协商的大门是敞开着的。我们坚决反对任何侵犯埃及主权和破坏运河航运的战争挑衅计划。如果英、法、美三国真正关心运河的航行自由，他们就应该悬崖勒马，放弃他们强行管理苏彝士运河的计划，回到和平协商的道路上来，其他的办法是没有的。
