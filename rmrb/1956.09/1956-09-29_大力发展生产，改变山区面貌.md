Comrade Zhou Lin, First Secretary of the CPC Guizhou Provincial Committee, spoke:
    I completely agree with the reports of Comrades Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, and Deng Xiaoping.

    Now, I would like to express some opinions on the issue of production in mountainous areas.

    Before liberation, Guizhou Province was a poor and backward area, and people of all ethnic groups lived in hunger and cold for a long time. Guizhou was liberated in 1949. Under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee, the people of the entire province carried out various social and democratic reform movements centered on land reform and the restoration of the national economy in order to change the backwardness of the mountainous areas. The completion of the land reform liberated the rural productive forces and opened up a broad path for the development of production in the mountainous areas. On this basis, the mutual aid and cooperation movement was launched in 1953. In the high tide of the socialist revolution this spring, we have also achieved a decisive victory in the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce.

    Grain Production Must Be Greatly Increased
    Now let us review the development of production in the mountainous areas of our province in the past few years.

    Before liberation, our province was a grain-deficient province, with an average grain income of only 410 jin per agricultural person. The unit area yield of grain crops was very low, only 236 jin per mu in 1950, and only 324 jin per mu last year. This situation was caused by the poverty and backward farming techniques left over from history. Generally speaking, the natural conditions such as temperature, rainfall, and soil quality in our province are not too bad. This means that there is still great potential for increasing the unit area yield of grain crops. However, increasing the unit area yield is not an easy task. In the past few years, some people believed that unless agriculture was mechanized, there was no other way to change the backward face of the mountainous areas, so they were unwilling to work hard to improve farming techniques. Others blindly reclaimed wasteland everywhere, refusing to cultivate intensively, resulting in extensive planting with low yields and soil erosion disasters. Facts have proved that these ideas and practices are not realistic. In the past few years, the main measures we have taken to increase the unit area yield are: (1) Developing small-scale water conservancy. More than 120,000 water conservancy projects have been built, expanding and improving the irrigated area by more than 7 million mu, while also achieving the effect of maintaining water and soil. (2) Improving farming techniques. Advanced farming techniques such as increasing fertilizer application, deep plowing and fine cultivation, using new agricultural implements, and selecting and retaining fine seeds have been promoted. (3) Expanding the multiple cropping area. In 1950, the multiple cropping area of the province accounted for only 8 percent of the cultivated land area, but by 1955 it had reached 35 percent of the cultivated land area. Due to the adoption of these basic measures, the agricultural level of our province has been improved. It is estimated that the average grain yield per mu this year may reach 380 jin, and the average grain income per agricultural person may reach 668 jin, and the lives of the people of all ethnic groups in the mountainous areas have been initially improved. However, this is still far from the requirement of 800 jin of grain per mu proposed in the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft), and we need to make continuous efforts.

    Developing Diversified Economy is of Great Significance
    In mountainous area production, in addition to developing grain production, the issue of diversified economy occupies a special position. It should be pointed out that there are many ways to produce in mountainous areas, which are suitable for developing cash crops, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline production. At the same time, the people of all ethnic groups in mountainous areas have always relied on the mountains to live and engaged in diversified economy. They have accumulated rich experience and knowledge in long-term labor production and fighting against nature. These are all good conditions for developing diversified economy. In the past few years, the production of tobacco, hemp, oil crops, tea, silkworm cocoons, cattle, and pigs in our province has increased significantly, and the income of farmers has increased rapidly. Below, I will quote some figures to illustrate this situation. In 1955, the total monetary income of farmers in the province was more than 230 million yuan, an increase of 78 percent compared with 1952. Among the total monetary income of farmers, the sale of commodity grain accounted for only 22 percent, while the income from local specialties, cash crops, and other sideline occupations accounted for 78 percent. It can be seen from this how important it is to develop diversified economy to increase farmers' income. Due to the development of diversified economy and grain production, the purchasing power of farmers in 1955 increased by 49.5 percent compared with 1952. This increase is not small. However, since the farmers' original family assets were too thin, the actual increase in the amount of money was not much. In 1955, the province averaged 1.5 zhang of cloth per person, which is much better than the situation in 1952 when each person could only buy 7 chi of cloth; however, such a standard of living is really too low. This tells us that we must continue to work hard to develop production and gradually change the poverty of the people in the mountainous areas. In the past, our understanding of this point was insufficient. If it is said that we have made many one-sided mistakes in guiding production in mountainous areas in the past few years, then our ideological one-sidedness in developing diversified economy is even greater, and it has not been well resolved until now. In the second half of last year and the spring of this year, we once universally neglected sideline production, so that both cattle and pigs decreased compared with 1954, which brought about unnecessary losses. This was of course caused by our subjective and bureaucratic leadership. This situation only began to be reversed after implementing the instructions of the Central Committee and the State Council on running cooperatives diligently and thriftily.

    Several Measures for Developing Diversified Economy
    What problems should we solve in developing diversified economy in mountainous areas?

    Formulate a Comprehensive Plan
    First, we believe that the important issue is to formulate a comprehensive plan that combines the development of grain crops and diversified economy. After cooperativization, if we do not conduct comprehensive planning, it will still be inevitable to have one-sidedness and blindness in production. This one-sidedness in production is manifested in many ways, either grasping grain production and neglecting sideline production, or emphasizing cash crops and relaxing animal husbandry. As for the blindness in production, it is concentrated in the pursuit of excessively high and unrealistic targets, thus generating reckless actions and fostering a coercive command style. Therefore, we should help each agricultural cooperative to carefully study the natural conditions and production status of the cooperative, and according to the needs of the state and the cooperative, formulate a practical and feasible comprehensive plan for the development of grain production, cash crops, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline production, and rationally arrange manpower, materials, and financial resources to ensure the comprehensive development of production in mountainous areas and give full play to the superiority of the cooperative. When formulating a comprehensive plan, special attention should be paid to ethnic characteristics, taking care of their planting habits and special needs, and overcoming the problem of generalization in work. At the same time, the relationship between the collective and the individual should be correctly handled, the scope of collective operation and the scope of individual operation of the members should be reasonably divided, and the members should be helped to do a good job in family sideline production.

    Strengthen Technical Guidance
    Second, the development of diversified economy is inseparable from technical guidance, and the promotion of advanced technology requires farmers to have a certain level of education. Our difficulty lies in the fact that science and technology and culture are in a very backward state. Due to the lack of technical guidance, the yield and quality of cash crops are generally very low, and some unnecessary losses have been caused. How do we solve this problem? At present, in addition to actively running secondary agricultural technical schools, strengthening agricultural scientific research, accelerating the training of technical personnel, and actively carrying out literacy work in rural areas, we have also adopted a method that combines the establishment of professional technical guidance stations with the universal training of farmer technical instructors. That is, from the farmers of all ethnic groups, select people with experience in a certain aspect, give them short-term training, and under the guidance of the technical guidance station, serve as technical instructors in their own townships and cooperatives. In this way, it is possible to combine summarizing the experience of local farmers with promoting advanced farming techniques, which can not only avoid one-sidedness in technical reform, but also help to overcome the conservative thinking of farmers. We have adopted this method in flue-cured tobacco, tea, animal husbandry, and other aspects, which proves to be a good method. In the future, we should also gradually improve the cultural and technical level of farmer technical instructors and train them to become agricultural technicians to meet the needs of the development of production in mountainous areas.

    Do a Good Job of Purchasing
    Third, the relevant economic departments should well support the development of production in backward mountainous areas, correctly implement the state's price policy, and earnestly do a good job in the purchasing of agricultural, sideline, and local specialties. In the past few years, we have widely carried out material exchanges and actively sought sales channels for agricultural, sideline, and local specialties in mountainous areas. The main local specialties operated by the commercial departments have increased from 166 types in 1952 to more than 300 types. Many things that were considered worthless in the past have now become valuable products. In terms of prices, taking ten major technical crops as an example, they were raised by 27 percent in 1955 compared with 1952. These measures have greatly increased farmers' income and promoted production in mountainous areas. However, the current problem is still that the prices of some local specialties and cash crops are too low, and they need to be appropriately adjusted. We feel that the price issue is a complex issue with a great impact on production. In the past, because our research was insufficient and we did not report the situation much, many shortcomings occurred. We hope that the relevant central departments will make reasonable arrangements for regional price differences in backward mountainous areas.

    Develop Small-Scale Processing Industries and Handicraft Workshops
    Fourth, local industry and handicrafts should actively support the development of cash crops in mountainous areas. We know that if industry, especially light industry, does not develop, the outlet for cash crops will not be large, and developing it will not be of much significance. Many of the cash crops in our province have not been developed as they should be precisely because of this reason. And these things are urgently needed industrial raw materials of the country. The tobacco, hemp, tussah silk, oil crops, mountain forest products, cattle, pigs, etc. in our province already have a considerable foundation. If factories can be set up locally to support them, they can all be developed into promising producing areas. In recent years, we have developed processing industries such as cigarette rolling and sugar making, which have achieved the effect of developing cash crops. However, due to limited investment and insufficient technical strength, the industry in our province is still very backward. Now many industrial raw materials have to be transported to other places for processing, which not only increases transportation costs and lowers purchase prices, but also often affects production due to poor planning coordination. Some products processed locally, such as oil crops and leather, are mostly processed by handicrafts. The advantage of this is that it adapts to the characteristics of inconvenient rural transportation and dispersed raw materials, and most of them are sideline occupations run by agricultural production cooperatives, which can increase the income of the cooperatives. However, the disadvantage is that the equipment and technology are backward, causing a lot of waste, and often they cannot be processed, resulting in a contradiction between the large backlog and partial spoilage of raw materials on the one hand, and the needs of the state and farmers on the other hand. All of this cannot but in turn affect and restrict the normal development of cash crops. In the future, we plan to develop some small-scale processing industries and handicraft workshops, improve equipment, improve technology, and expand production capacity to meet the needs of the development of production in mountainous areas.

    Develop Transportation
    In the work of developing production in mountainous areas and improving the lives of the people in mountainous areas, developing the transportation industry is also an important matter. In the past few years, we have built many roads and renovated waterways, and vigorously developed automobile transportation and mass transportation. The freight volume has increased tenfold, and the price scissors difference between industrial and agricultural products has narrowed. However, at present, the transportation in our province is still very closed, which has a great impact on the development of production in mountainous areas and the exploitation of the rich underground resources in mountainous areas. The people urgently demand to solve this problem. Why have the people of all ethnic groups in the mountainous areas of Guizhou spent 20 million workdays to build highways in the past few years, and are now supporting the state to build the Sichuan-Guizhou and Guizhou-Guangxi railways with unparalleled enthusiasm? This is completely understandable. Because they have suffered from the inconvenience of transportation, they clearly know that the construction of railways and highways will bring them further upsurge in industrial and agricultural production and rapid improvement in material and cultural life.

### 大力发展生产，改变山区面貌

专栏：

    大力发展生产，改变山区面貌
    中共贵州省委员会第一书记　周林同志的发言
    我完全同意刘少奇同志、周恩来同志和邓小平同志的报告。
    现在，我就山区生产问题发表一些意见。
    贵州省在解放前是一个贫穷落后的地区，各族人民长期过着饥寒交迫的生活。一九四九年贵州解放，全省人民在党中央的正确领导下，为着改变山区的落后面貌，进行了以土地改革为中心的各项社会民主改革运动和国民经济的恢复工作。土地改革的完成，解放了农村生产力，为发展山区生产开辟了广阔的道路。在这个基础上，自一九五三年起，开展了互助合作运动。在今春的社会主义革命高潮中，我们又取得了对农业、对手工业和对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造的决定性的胜利。
    粮食生产还要大大提高
    现在让我们来回顾一下这几年我省山区生产的发展状况。
    在解放前，我省是一个缺粮的省份，每个农业人口的平均粮食收入仅有四一○斤。粮食作物的单位面积产量很低，一九五○年每亩仅为二三六斤，去年也只达到每亩三二四斤的水平。这种状况，是由于历史上遗留下来的贫困和耕作技术落后造成的。一般讲来，我省的气温、雨量、土质等自然条件，都是并不太坏的。这就是说，在提高粮食作物的单位面积产量上，还有很大的潜力。但是，提高单位面积产量并不是一件轻而易举的事情。前几年，有些人认为除非农业实行机械化，要改变山区的落后面貌就别无他法，因此他们不愿意下苦功去改进耕作技术。另外有些人则到处盲目开荒，不肯深耕细作，结果换来的却是广种薄收和水土流失的灾害。事实证明，这些想法和做法都是不切合实际的。这几年，我们在提高单位面积产量上采取的主要措施是：（1）发展小型水利。兴修了水利工程十二万余处，扩大和改善灌溉面积七○○余万亩，同时收到了保持水土的功效。（2）改进耕作技术。推广了增施肥料、深耕细作、使用新式农具、选留良种等先进的耕作技术。（3）扩大复种面积。一九五○年全省复种面积仅占耕地面积的百分之八，到一九五五年已达到耕地面积的百分之三十五。由于采取了这些基本的措施，我省的农业水平已有提高，今年粮食每亩平均产量预计可能达到三八○斤，每个农业人口的平均粮食收入可能达到六六八斤，山区各族人民的生活业已获得初步的改善。但是，这距离全国农业发展纲要（草案）中提出的每亩产粮八○○斤的要求还很远，需要我们不断的努力。
    发展多种经营的意义极大
    在山区生产中，除了发展粮食生产以外，占有特殊地位的是多种经营问题。应该指出，山区生产的门路很多，适宜于发展经济作物、林业、畜牧业和副业生产。同时，山区各族人民历来就是靠山吃山，从事多种经营，他们在长期进行劳动生产和同自然界作斗争中积累了丰富的经验和知识。这都是发展多种经营的良好条件。几年来，我省的烟、麻、油料、茶叶、蚕茧、牛、猪都获得了大量的增产，农民的收入迅速地增长了。下面我要引用一些数字来说明这个情况。一九五五年全省农民的货币总收入为二三、○○○多万元，比一九五二年增加了百分之七十八。在农民的货币总收入中，商品粮出售只占百分之二十二，而土特产品、经济作物和其他副业收入则占百分之七十八。由此可见，发展多种经营对于增加农民的收入有多么重要的意义。由于多种经营和粮食生产的发展，农民的购买力一九五五年比一九五二年上升了百分之四十九·五。这个上升的幅度是不算小的。但是，由于农民原来的家底太薄，因而实际增加的金额并不多。一九五五年全省每人平均买一丈五尺布，较之一九五二年每人只能买七尺布的光景，已经好得多了；但是，这样的生活水平实在是太低的。这就告诉我们，今后还要努力去发展生产，逐步改变山区人民的贫困状态。过去我们对这一点是认识不足的。如果说，这几年我们在对山区生产的指导上曾经犯过不少片面性的毛病，那么，在发展多种经营这个问题上，我们思想上的片面性就要更大一些，而且至今还没有很好解决。在去年下半年和今年春季，我们曾经一度普遍地忽视副业生产，以致牛猪均比一九五四年减少，招来了不应有的损失。这当然是由于我们领导上的主观主义、官僚主义造成的。这种情况，自从贯彻执行中央和国务院关于勤俭办社的指示以后，才开始扭转过来。
    发展多种经营的几项措施
    我们在发展山区的多种经营方面，要解决些什么问题呢？
    制订全面规划
    第一，我们认为，重要的问题是要制订发展粮食作物和多种经营相结合的全面规划。在合作化以后，如果我们不进行全面规划，就仍然不可避免地要在生产上发生片面性和盲目性。这种生产上的片面性，表现是多样的，或者是抓粮食生产忽视副业生产，或者是强调经济作物又放松畜牧业。至于生产上的盲目性，则集中地表现于追求过高的、实际上是办不到的指标，因而产生蛮干行为，滋长着强迫命令作风。因此，我们应当帮助每个农业社认真研究本社的自然条件和生产状况，根据国家和合作社的需要，制订出切实可行的发展粮食生产、经济作物、林业、畜牧业和副业生产的全面规划，并且合理地安排人力、物力和财力，以保证山区生产的全面发展，充分发挥合作社的优越性。在制订全面规划的时候，特别应当注意民族特点，照顾他们的种植习惯和特殊需要，克服工作上一般化的毛病。同时，应当正确地处理集体和个人的关系，合理划分集体经营和社员个人经营的范围，帮助社员搞好家庭副业生产。
    加强技术指导
    第二，多种经营的发展是和技术的指导不可分割的，而先进技术的推广又需要农民有一定的文化水平。我们的困难就在于科学技术和文化都处于十分落后的状态。由于缺乏技术指导，经济作物的产量和质量一般都是很低的，而且曾经造成了某些不应有的损失。我们如何解决这个问题呢？目前除了积极的举办中等农业技术学校，加强农业科学研究，加速培养技术人员，并在农村中积极地进行扫盲工作以外，还采取了设立专业的技术指导站与普遍训练农民技术辅导员相结合的办法。即是从各族农民中，挑选在某一方面有经验的人，加以短期训练，在技术指导站的指导下，担任本乡本社的技术辅导员。这样做，就能够把总结当地农民的经验与推广先进的耕作技术结合起来，既能避免技术改革中的片面性，又有利于克服农民的保守思想。我们在烤烟、茶叶、畜牧等方面，都采取了这个办法，证明这是一个好办法。今后，我们还应逐步提高农民技术辅导员的文化和技术水平，把他们培养成为农业技术人员，以适应山区生产发展的需要。
    作好收购工作
    第三，有关的经济部门要很好地扶持落后山区生产的发展，要正确地执行国家的价格政策，切实做好农副土特产品的收购工作。几年来，我们曾经广泛地开展了物资交流，积极为山区的农副土特产品寻找销路。商业部门经营的主要土特产品，由一九五二年的一六六种增加到三○○种以上，许多过去被认为是不值钱的东西，现在都成了贵重的产品。在价格上，以十种主要技术作物为例，一九五五年比一九五二年上调了百分之二十七。这些措施，都使农民收入大大增加，促进了山区生产。但是，目前存在的问题仍然是某些土特产品和经济作物的价格偏低，还须要继续适当调整。我们觉得价格问题是一个复杂的问题，对生产的影响很大，过去因为我们研究不够，反映情况不多，曾经发生过不少缺点。我们希望中央有关部门对于落后山区的地区差价作合理的安排。
    发展小型加工工业和手工业作坊
    第四，地方工业和手工业都要积极支持山区经济作物的发展。我们知道，如果工业特别是轻工业不发展，经济作物的出路就不大，发展它也就没有多大意义。我省现有的许多经济作物，也正是因为这个原故，还没有得到应有的发展。而这些东西，都是国家迫切需要的工业原料。我省的烟、麻、柞蚕丝、油料作物、山林特产、牛、猪等，已有相当基础，如能就地设厂，加以支持，都可以发展成为有希望的产区。这些年来，我们发展了卷烟、制糖等加工工业，收到了发展经济作物的效果。但是，由于投资有限和技术力量不足，我省的工业仍是十分落后的。现在有许多工业原料，都要运到外地去加工，这不仅增加了运费，压低了收购价格，而且还常因计划衔接不好，影响了生产。在本地加工的某些产品，如油料、皮革等，大部分是用手工业加工，它的好处是适应农村交通不便和原料分散的特点，而且多为农业生产合作社经营的副业，可以增加社的收入。但缺点是设备和技术落后，造成了许多浪费，而且常常加工不出来，出现了一边是原料的大量积压和部分霉变，另一边是国家和农民的需要不能得到满足的矛盾。所有这些，都不能不反过来影响和限制经济作物的正常发展。今后，我们打算发展一些小型的加工工业和手工业作坊，改善设备，提高技术，扩大生产能力，以适应山区生产发展的需要。
    发展交通运输
    在发展山区生产，改善山区人民生活的工作中，发展交通运输业也是一件重要的事情。几年来，我们修了许多道路和整治了航道，大力发展了汽车运输和群众运输，货运量数以十倍的增加了，工农业产品的剪刀差缩小了。但是，目前我省的交通仍然是很闭塞的，这对于发展山区生产、开发山区丰富的地下资源有极大的影响，人民迫切要求解决这个问题。为什么贵州山区各族人民，在这几年花了二、○○○万个工日来修建公路，现在又正以无比的热情支援国家修建川黔、黔桂两条铁路呢？这是完全可以理解的。因为他们饱受交通不便之苦，他们清楚地知道，修建铁路、公路，将为他们带来工农业生产的进一步高涨和物质文化生活的迅速改善。
