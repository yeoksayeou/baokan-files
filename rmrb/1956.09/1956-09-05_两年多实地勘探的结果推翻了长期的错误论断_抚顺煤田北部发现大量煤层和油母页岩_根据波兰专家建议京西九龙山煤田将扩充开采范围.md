Xinhua News Agency, Fushun, September 3rd: After careful exploration and well construction design exploration, it has been proven that the northern part of the Fushun Coalfield still contains abundant coal resources. When Japanese imperialists mined this coalfield, they believed that there was no more coal north of the northern boundary of the Fushun Coalfield, and the coal in the existing mines would be exhausted in a few years. A few years ago, Soviet experts, based on the Fushun Coalfield exploration data, inferred that the past judgment was wrong, and there was still coal north of the old boundary. Based on the suggestions of Soviet experts, the Fushun Mining Bureau began large-scale geological exploration work in 1954. The newly discovered coalfield is ten kilometers long and two hundred to four hundred meters wide, with a coal seam thickness of fifty meters; above the coal seam, there is a rich layer of oil shale with a thickness of one hundred meters. In order to build mines in the newly discovered coalfield, well construction technical design drilling was carried out this year. The data obtained in the past eight months have proved that in the eastern part of the newly discovered coalfield, North Longfeng Mine and North Laohutai Mine, which are about the same size as the current Longfeng Mine and Laohutai Mine, can be built, and in the western part, the West Open-pit Mine and Shengli Mine can be expanded.
	Currently, the expansion project has started in full swing, and the construction of new mines will also begin next year.
	During this exploration process, the water storage situation in the Fushun Coalfield was also clarified, and the laws of water movement were studied, explaining that the rockslides in open-pit mines were caused by the action of water. The designers of the Fushun East Open-pit Mine, based on the obtained hydrological data, have made a mining design that can avoid the hazards of rockslides to the open-pit mine.

Xinhua News Agency: The underground resources of the Jiulongshan Coalfield in the western suburbs of Beijing will be fully utilized. This new mining plan was determined under the suggestions of Polish experts.
	The Jiulongshan Coalfield is located in the northwest of the Mentougou Mine, covering an area of more than twenty square kilometers. It has a large reserve, simple geological structure, relatively stable coal seam thickness, and relatively solid roof and floor. It is the best coalfield already explored in the Jingxi mining area. According to the geological report originally submitted by the Jingxi Mining Bureau, two-thirds of the reserves in this coalfield are not within the mining range of future mines. This would prevent this huge coal resource from serving the country's economic construction in the near future; if mining is carried out decades later, another sum of money will have to be invested, and many difficulties may arise in the mining work.
	The mine construction project of this coalfield is designed with the help of the People's Republic of Poland. After the Polish experts came here and learned about and surveyed the coalfield, they suggested building larger mines and utilizing the resources of the entire coalfield. The experts pointed out that this goal can be achieved by excavating an elliptical adit as long as eleven kilometers in addition to the planned vertical shaft. With the help of Polish experts, the Jingxi Mining Bureau has supplemented drilling and tunneling.

    两年多实地勘探的结果推翻了长期的错误论断
    抚顺煤田北部发现大量煤层和油母页岩
    根据波兰专家建议京西九龙山煤田将扩充开采范围
    新华社抚顺3日电　抚顺煤田经过精查勘探和建井设计勘探，证明这里的北部仍然蕴藏着丰富的煤炭。日本帝国主义者开采这块煤田时，曾经认为抚顺煤田北部境界线以北再没有煤，原有矿井的煤再有几年就采完了。几年前，苏联专家根据抚顺煤田勘探资料推断，认为过去的判断是错误的，旧境界以北还有煤。抚顺矿务局根据苏联专家建议，在1954年开始大规模的地质勘探工程，新探出的煤田长有十公里，宽二百公尺到四百公尺，煤层厚度达五十公尺；在煤层上面还覆盖有厚达一百公尺的油母页岩的富矿层。为了在新探明的煤田上建设矿井，今年又进行了建井技术设计钻探。这八个月来所获得的资料证明，在新探明的煤田东部，可以建设与现在龙凤矿和老虎台矿差不多大的北龙凤矿和北老虎台矿，西部可以扩建西露天矿和胜利矿。
    目前扩建工程已经全面动工，新建矿井在明年也将动工兴建。
    在这次勘探过程中，还查清了抚顺煤田的水的蕴藏情况，研究出水的运动规律，说明了露天矿的岩石滑落是由于水的作用引起的。设计抚顺东露天矿的设计师们，根据获得的水文资料，作出了可以避免岩石滑落遗害露天矿的开采设计。
    据新华社讯　北京西郊九龙山煤田的地下资源，将被充分利用。这一新的开采方案是在波兰专家的建议下确定下来的。
    九龙山煤田位于门头沟矿井的西北部，方圆二十多平方公里，储藏量很大，并且地质构造较简单，煤层厚度比较稳定，顶板底板比较坚固，是京西矿区已经探明的煤田中最好的一个。按照京西矿务局原来提出的地质报告书，这个煤田三分之二的储藏量，不在未来的矿井的开采范围内。这样，就使这一巨大的煤炭资源在最近的几十年内不能为国家的经济建设服务；如果几十年后再进行开采，那就要另投入一笔资金，同时在开采工作中还可能产生很多困难。
    这个煤田的矿井建设工程是请波兰人民共和国帮助设计的。波兰专家来这里以后了解和踏勘了煤田的情况，建议建设更大的矿井，把整个煤田的资源都利用起来。专家指出只要在原计划建设的竖井之外，再开凿一个长达十一公里的椭圆形平峒，就可达到这一目的。在波兰专家帮助下，京西矿务局又补充作了钻探和巷探。
