    Important Issues in Current Grain Production

    In his political report to the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Comrade Liu Shaoqi pointed out that during the period of the Second Five-Year Plan, the main way to increase agricultural production would still not be to expand the area of cultivated land, but to take various measures to increase the yield per unit area of crops.

    The political report pointed out that the target for grain output in the last year of the First Five-Year Plan may be reached this year. This does not mean that we can ignore grain production in 1957. Although the annual output target has been reached, whether the target for the five-year growth in total agricultural output value can be achieved depends on the performance of agricultural production in the last year. Comrade Zhou Enlai, on behalf of the CPC Central Committee, said in his report on the proposal for the Second Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy: "In the next few years, China's agricultural production will still be greatly affected by natural disasters. In order to cope with poor harvests, there must be reserves of grain and major cash crops." Therefore, striving to fulfill and overfulfill the grain production plan for 1957 is still an important task that cannot be ignored.

    The main problem in grain production at present is to intensify the sowing of winter wheat. Wheat occupies an important position among various grain crops. In 1953, wheat suffered from frost damage and a poor harvest, which affected the completion of the total grain output plan; in 1954, autumn grain production was reduced due to floods, but the bumper harvest of wheat made the total grain output grow that year. Wheat also has the characteristics of stable yield and early harvest, which can enable us to connect food rations early between two harvests; it is also a winter crop, which can be combined with autumn-ripe crops such as corn to increase the total grain output. Therefore, continued attention should still be paid to the continuous improvement of wheat production.

    The main way to increase wheat production at present is to increase the yield per unit area. Because major rapeseed production areas may squeeze out some wheat planting area in the future, the increase in wheat yield per unit area is even more important.

    China's wheat yield has been increasing continuously in recent years, but at present, the national average yield per mu is only more than 120 jin. Compared with other major grain crops, wheat yield is still quite low. How to strive to increase the yield per unit area of wheat is a very important issue in current grain production, especially wheat production.

    Can the yield per unit area of wheat be significantly increased? The wheat thousand-jin yield of Heping Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yongji County, Shanxi Province, answered this question this year (the wheat high-yield situation and experience of this cooperative can be found on page 6 of today's newspaper). In fact, this summer, more than 50 agricultural cooperatives in Shaanxi, Shanxi, Hebei, Hubei, Gansu and other provinces have seen high-yield wheat fields with a yield of 1,000 jin per mu, and many cooperatives have dozens of mu of such high-yield fields. High yields of wheat have also appeared in some areas with poor natural conditions. Baofeng Agricultural Cooperative in Yongning County, Gansu Province, created a record of 1,000 jin of wheat per mu on 30 mu of saline-alkali land; in Lianxin Agricultural Cooperative at the foot of Helan Mountain, there were 15 mu of wheat with a yield of 1,100 jin per mu.

    Of course, obtaining wheat fields with a yield of 1,000 jin per mu has its special conditions. For example, the wheat fields of Heping Agricultural Cooperative are well-cultivated irrigated land with a large amount of livestock manure and chemical fertilizers. Under the current circumstances, this is not easy to achieve universally. However, with the development of advanced agricultural cooperativization and the national socialist industrialization, the possibility of generally, significantly, and continuously increasing wheat yields is increasing day by day.

    In the agricultural production increase movement in the past few years, rural workers in some places have made efforts to generally and extensively increase wheat yields. For example, the average yield per mu of more than 20 million mu of winter wheat in Shaanxi Province this year is 200.5 jin. There are also many counties in other provinces where the average wheat yield is higher than the general level. Are the natural conditions in these areas particularly superior to other areas? No. Take Shaanxi, for example, according to the statistics of the five years from 1941 to 1945 before liberation, the average wheat yield per mu was only 88 jin. Other high-yield areas have also been raised from the original low-yield basis. The superior conditions provided by advanced cooperatives this year have made wheat yields increase rapidly. For example, in the Hexi Corridor of Gansu and Anguo in Hebei, wheat has generally increased by about 50% compared with last year; some places have even doubled. These facts show that it is also possible to obtain high wheat yields on a large area.

    What are the main experiences of large-scale high-yield wheat increase? According to the summaries of various places, these experiences are deep plowing, close planting, selection of improved varieties, timely sowing, increased fertilization and strengthened field management, etc. These methods are not new. It is precisely those places that think these are not new experiences and do not implement them seriously that the output is always not improved; and those places that have effectively adopted these methods have achieved new records of high yield. The main reason why the average wheat yield per mu in Shaanxi Province is more than 200 jin is that people there have seriously promoted various yield-increasing measures. For example, the Bima No. 1 improved variety had only more than 200 mu in 1949, and now it has been popularized to a large area of more than 18 million mu in the Guanzhong area, and has eliminated the yellow rust disease that seriously affects wheat production. In Shaanxi Province, most wheat fields were sown by broadcasting before liberation, and more than 85% of wheat fields were sparsely planted. Now, more than 70% of wheat fields have implemented strip planting and close planting. Each region has improved varieties suitable for local natural conditions, such as Bima No. 1 and Zaoyang wheat in the northern winter wheat area, and Nanda 2419 in the Yangtze River Basin, etc., which are all excellent varieties that have been repeatedly tested and proven effective in the local area, and can be gradually promoted on a larger area. In some row-sowing areas, as long as the distance of the original row legs is shortened, and the seeding amount is appropriately increased according to the soil fertility and fertilization amount, reasonable close planting can also significantly increase production. This has also been proven by practice in recent years.

    Of course, deep plowing, close planting, selection of improved varieties, timely sowing, increased fertilization, etc. are difficult for scattered individual farmers; and even more difficult for many relatively poor farmers. It is also more difficult to break ideological barriers in promoting technological reforms among individual farmers. However, we now have relatively mature wheat production increase experience; and advanced agricultural cooperativization provides extremely favorable conditions for various production increase measures. As long as we strengthen leadership, adapt to local conditions, use local advanced experience to promote the general, and specifically help agricultural cooperatives solve the difficult problems in technological reform, the rapid increase in wheat yield is entirely possible.

    Wheat was generally exposed to rain during the ripening season this year, and the quality of seeds was poor. It is more important this year than in previous years to carefully select improved varieties, do a good job in seed inspection and germination tests. The sowing amount should be appropriately increased for those with lower germination rates. This year, due to disasters in some areas, the amount of long-distance transportation of wheat seeds is very large. Areas that transfer seeds from other places should transport them on time and distribute them to the masses in time without delaying sowing; they should also pay close attention to the regional adaptability of the varieties and carefully explain the cultivation characteristics of the varieties to the masses to prevent mis-transportation, mis-distribution, and mis-planting. At the same time, we should also prepare base fertilizer for winter wheat as much as possible to meet the needs of close planting. Drainage is even more important in many waterlogged areas in Hebei and Henan. These all need to be done immediately.

    Autumn harvest and autumn sowing are linked together, and agricultural affairs are tense. Better organization of labor can ensure the quality of sowing. Areas that plant winter wheat should make full use of the superior conditions of cooperativization, earnestly promote the experience of high yield, seize the opportunity, and sow the seeds for a bumper harvest next summer!

    当前粮食生产的重要问题
    刘少奇同志代表中国共产党中央委员会向第八次全国代表大会的政治报告中指出：在第二个五年计划的时期内，农业增产的主要办法仍然不是扩大耕地面积，而是采取种种措施来提高农作物的单位面积产量。
    政治报告中指出：第一个五年计划最后一年的粮食产量的指标，在今年就可能达到。这决不是说，对于1957年度的粮食生产，就可以不必再注意了。虽然年产量的指标达到了，但能否保证五年农产品总值增长的指标的实现，却还要看最后一年的农业生产成绩如何。周恩来同志代表中共中央在关于发展国民经济的第二个五年计划的建议的报告中说：“今后若干年内，我国农业生产受自然灾害的影响还会是很大的，为了应付歉收，就必须有粮食和主要经济作物的储备”。因此，努力完成和超额完成1957年的粮食生产计划，仍然是不可忽视的重要任务。
    目前粮食生产上的主要问题是要加紧冬小麦的播种工作。小麦在各种粮食作物中占有重要的位置。1953年曾因小麦遭到霜灾歉收，影响到粮食总产量计划的完成；1954年秋粮因水灾减产，但因小麦丰收，使那年粮食总产量仍有增长。小麦还有稳产早收的特点，能使我们在两次收割之间早日接上口粮；它又是冬季作物，可以同玉米等秋熟作物配合，以提高粮食的总产量。因此，当前对于小麦产量的继续提高，仍然应当密切注意。
    当前提高小麦产量的主要途径就是提高单位面积产量。因为油菜籽主要产区今后可能挤掉一部分小麦播种面积，小麦单位面积产量的提高就显得更加重要了。
    我国的小麦产量几年来不断提高，但目前全国每亩平均产量还只有一百二十多斤。同别的主要粮食作物相比，小麦的产量还是相当低的。怎样努力提高小麦的单位面积产量，是目前粮食生产特别是小麦生产上一个很重要的问题。
    小麦单位面积产量究竟能不能比较显著地提高呢？今年山西永济县和平农业生产合作社的小麦千斤丰产回答了这个问题（这个社的小麦丰产情况和经验见今天本报第六版）。事实上，今年夏季在陕西、山西、河北、湖北、甘肃等省的五十多个农业社里，都出现了小麦每亩产量达一千斤的丰产地，而且许多社有几十亩这样的丰产地。在一些自然条件较差的地方，也出现了小麦的高额产量。甘肃永宁县宝丰农业社，在三十亩盐碱地上创造了小麦每亩千斤的产量纪录；在贺兰山脚下的联新农业社，有十五亩小麦亩产一千一百斤。
    自然，获得亩产千斤的麦田，是有它的特殊条件的。例如和平农业社的麦田，是地力培养得较好的水浇地，施用了大量的牲口粪和化学肥料。在目前情况下，这是不容易普遍做到的。但随着农业高级合作化和国家社会主义工业化的发展，小麦的产量普遍地、显著地、不断地提高的可能性是日益增大了。
    在几年来的农业增产运动中，一些地方的农村工作者在普遍地、大面积地提高小麦产量方面，已经作了努力。如陕西全省二千多万亩冬小麦，今年平均亩产二百点五斤。其他省有些县份小麦平均产量高出一般水平的也很多。是不是这些地区的自然条件比别的地区特别优越呢？不是的。就说陕西吧，据解放前1941—1945这五年间的统计，小麦每亩平均产量只有八十八斤。其他一些高产地区也都是从原来低产的基础上提高起来的。今年高级合作社所提供的优越条件，使小麦产量提高得很快，如甘肃河西走廊、河北安国等地，小麦一般都比去年增产五成左右；有些地方甚至增产一倍。这些事实说明：在大面积上取得小麦的高额产量也是可能的。
    小麦高额大面积增产的主要经验是什么呢？根据各地的总结，这些经验就是深耕、密植、选用良种、适期播种、增施肥料和加强田间管理等等。这些办法说起来并不新鲜。正是那些以为并不是新鲜经验而不去认真实行的地方，产量就老是提不高；而那些切实采取了这些办法的地方，就出现了高额丰产的新纪录。陕西全省小麦产量平均亩产二百斤以上，主要原因是那里的人们认真推行了各项增产措施。如碧蚂一号良种，在1949年还只有二百多亩，现已普及到关中地区一千八百多万亩的大面积上，并且消灭了严重影响小麦产量的黄锈病。在陕西省，解放前大部麦田是撒播的，85％以上的麦田是稀植的，现在已有70％以上麦田施行了条播密植。各个地区各有适合当地自然条件的良种，如北方冬麦区的碧蚂一号和早洋麦，长江流域的南大2419等，都是在当地屡经试验确实有效的优良品种，都可以逐步地在更大面积上推广。在一些耧播地区，只要把原来的耧腿距离缩短，并根据地力及施肥量适当增加播种量，合理密植，也可以显著增产，这也是几年来的实践已经证明了的。
    当然，深耕、密植、选用良种、适期播种、增施肥料等等，对于分散生产的个体农民是有一定困难的；对于许多比较贫困的农民来说更加困难。在个体农民中间推行技术改革，思想上的障碍也比较不易打破。但是，我们现在已经有了比较成熟的小麦增产经验；农业的高级合作化，又给各项增产措施提供了极为有利的条件。只要加强领导，因地制宜，运用当地的先进经验，推动一般，并且具体帮助农业社解决技术改革中的困难问题，小麦产量的迅速提高，是完全可能的。
    今年小麦成熟时节普遍遇雨，种子质量不好，精选良种、作好种子检验和发芽试验，比往年更为要紧。发芽率较低的要适当增加播种量。今年因为部分地区受灾，小麦种子远程调运量很大。从外地调种的地区，要按时调运，及时发到群众手里，不误播种；还要密切注意品种区域的适应性，要把品种的栽培特性认真向群众交代清楚，防止错运、错发、错种。同时，还要尽可能为冬小麦准备基肥，以适应密植的需要。河北、河南许多受涝地区，排水更是要紧的事。这些都需要立即作好。
    秋收秋种相连，农事紧张，更好地组织劳力，才能保证播种的质量。种植冬麦的地区应该充分运用合作化的优越条件，认真推行高额丰产的经验，抓紧时机，播下明年夏季丰产的种子！
