After the implementation of full industry-wide joint public-private ownership of capitalist industry and commerce, the state, based on the principle of employing people according to their abilities and providing appropriate care, has assigned positions to the original private personnel in the enterprises, and many private personnel have been assigned to leadership positions at various levels. Making private personnel have rights and responsibilities in the positions arranged by the state, and urging and helping them to fulfill their responsibilities, is an important issue related to the proper production and operation of enterprises and the cooperative relationship between the public and private sectors; it is also an important issue that combines the transformation of private personnel in work practice with leveraging their skills in production and management.

Currently, in many joint public-private enterprises, a system of collective leadership and division of labor has been established under the leadership of the Party. The powers and responsibilities of private personnel have received due respect from public representatives and the masses of workers, and private personnel have also actively assumed their responsibilities. Public representatives and private personnel have a reasonable division of labor based on their respective expertise, and public representatives and the masses of workers support and help private personnel to achieve results. In these joint ventures, production and operation have improved, the cooperative relationship between the public and private sectors has improved, the skills and experience of private personnel have been brought into play, and their ideological level has gradually improved. This is a good phenomenon. However, in many other joint ventures, the issue of the powers and responsibilities of private personnel has not been properly resolved. Public representatives and the masses of workers still lack active support for the work of private personnel, and private personnel are still subjected to varying degrees of cold treatment, or there is a phenomenon of "respecting each other as guests" and "incompatibility" between the public and private sectors. The cooperative relationship between the public and private sectors is generally newly established, and the existence of this phenomenon is not surprising. However, if this problem is not actively resolved, it will not only affect the ideological transformation and the unleashing of the active role of private personnel, but also be detrimental to the production and operation of the enterprise.

How should we correctly understand the powers and responsibilities of private personnel?

It must be seen that after the full industry-wide joint public-private ownership and the implementation of fixed interest, the relations of production in enterprises have undergone fundamental changes. The powers and responsibilities of private personnel in joint public-private enterprises are now different from their powers and responsibilities in capitalist enterprises in the past.

In capitalist enterprises, the powers and responsibilities of private personnel came from their possession of the means of production – because the means of production of the enterprise are owned by the capitalists, the powers and responsibilities of the capitalists arise. This kind of power we usually call the three rights of the capitalist, namely: the right to own enterprise property, the right to manage the enterprise, and the right to allocate personnel. Private personnel exercise and use this power in the enterprise to rule the enterprise and pursue profits. In the process of the state's gradual and peaceful transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, the state, on the one hand, recognized the three rights of capitalists, and on the other hand, it was necessary to restrict and supervise their three rights, and to resolutely combat their profit-seeking speculation and illegal activities.

After the full industry-wide joint public-private ownership and fixed interest, the powers and responsibilities of private personnel in the enterprise are a completely different kind of power. Capitalists now have a dual identity: on the one hand, they are still capitalists, and on the other hand, they are enterprise public officials arranged by the state. Due to the change in the relations of production, their powers and responsibilities in the enterprise are no longer the three rights of capitalists based on the capitalist private ownership of the means of production, but the powers and responsibilities of public officials granted by the state. They are no longer working for private ownership in the enterprise, but serving socialism. Obviously, it is entrusted by the state to private personnel to exercise this power of public officials, which is in the interests of the working class. Therefore, the relationship between the public and private sectors in joint public-private enterprises is not only a class relationship, but also a socialist working relationship.

Here, we should not only recognize the fundamental changes in the powers and responsibilities of private personnel, but also understand the significant significance of this change. What does this change illustrate? (1) This change shows that the capitalist relations of production have undergone fundamental changes. Although capitalist ownership has not been finally eliminated, this kind of ownership is incomplete, but only a remnant ownership. The capitalists' right to own the means of production has been separated from the right to use them, and they can no longer rely on this ownership to occupy a dominant position in the enterprise. (2) This change marks that the negative role of capitalists is more strictly restricted, and their positive role can be brought into greater play; it marks the transition of private personnel to self-reliant laborers. (3) This change is more conducive to combining the transformation of the ideology of private personnel with the utilization of their skills and experience, and is more conducive to transforming them from work practice.

Giving private personnel power and responsibility in joint ventures, as well as urging them to fulfill their responsibilities in their work, is of great significance for both the ideological transformation of private personnel and the production and operation of enterprises. Taking the enterprise as a base to transform private personnel through work practice is not only to arrange the positions of private personnel in joint public-private enterprises, but more importantly, after arranging the positions, to enable them to be trained in work practice, learn socialist working methods, and gradually improve their ideological level from practice. Private personnel should strive to transform themselves through work practice and make contributions and achievements in their work. On the other hand, most of the private personnel have certain business skills and experience, many of which are useful to the state. Their expertise is a wealth of the country. It is absolutely necessary to bring their expertise into full play to properly manage the production and operation of enterprises.

Some public representatives and the masses of workers in certain joint ventures still have doubts and resistance to giving private personnel power and responsibility. They believe that if private personnel are given power and responsibility, aren't they working under the leadership of the bourgeoisie? Obviously, this view is one-sided. Here, we cannot confuse class relations with personal relations. The leadership of the working class is manifested politically as the leadership of the state power and the political line, and economically as the leadership of the socialist economy and the state plan. Specifically, for joint public-private enterprises, it is also manifested as the leadership of the government business departments and the Party in the enterprise. Is it that putting private personnel in leadership positions in enterprises and giving them power and responsibility is to be led by the bourgeoisie? Of course not. (1) The positions of private personnel in enterprises are arranged by the state, their powers and responsibilities are granted by the state, and they are working for socialism under the leadership of the state. (2) The business work of joint public-private enterprises is carried out under the leadership of the government business departments, and there is a system of collective responsibility under the leadership of the Party committee within the enterprise. The work of private personnel must be subject to the policies and plans of the state and follow the policies of the Party and the state. They cannot violate the policies of the Party and the state and abuse their power. (3) The management of enterprise production and operation is carried out with the participation and support of the masses of workers. Respecting the powers and responsibilities of private personnel does not mean giving up criticism and education of their capitalist business ideas and styles. Their shortcomings and mistakes must be appropriately criticized and helped to be corrected so that they can better work for the country. We must recognize the consistency between respecting the powers and responsibilities of private personnel and the interests of the working class. Giving them power and responsibility and fully发挥积极作用 is not only necessary for transforming the ideology of private personnel, but also beneficial to the country and to production and operation.

Now the question is this: Are we going to transform the bourgeois elements in socialist work practice? Or are we just talking about transforming them verbally, but actually letting them go or "fearing wolves and tigers"? Are we going to use their experience and ability to serve the country? Or do we treat them as "burdens" without analysis? Isn't this easy to answer?

It is undeniable that some private personnel currently have some negative emotions, such as abandoning their due responsibilities, or being afraid of taking responsibility. Some people still lack awareness of the past mistakes of oppressing workers, and still maintain a commanding attitude towards workers. Some people are complacent and arrogant, relying on a set of methods, and have not seriously learned the working style of the mass line. These cannot but affect the relationship between the workers and the private personnel, and affect the cooperative relationship between the public and private sectors. Private personnel should earnestly change their old ideological style, take the initiative to approach the working class, go deep into the reality of work, combine their business knowledge with the practical experience of the workers, study hard, strive for the support and help of public representatives and the masses of workers, and fully contribute their talents to serve the great socialist construction.

    正确认识私方人员在公私合营企业中的职权
    大同
    资本主义工商业实行全行业公私合营以后，国家对原企业的私方人员，根据量才使用并给予适当照顾的原则，在企业中分别安排了职务，并且有不少的私方人员被安排担任了各级领导职务。使私方人员在国家安排的职位上有权有责，以及督促和帮助他们尽职尽责，是关系到搞好企业的生产经营和公私双方共事关系的一个重要问题；同时也是在工作实践中来改造私方人员，并将改造他们的思想和发挥他们在生产经营上的积极作用结合起来的一个重要问题。
    目前，在许多公私合营企业中，在党的领导下，建立了集体领导、分工负责的制度。私方人员的职权得到了公方代表和职工群众应有的尊重，私方人员也积极地负起了责任。公私双方人员根据各人的专长有了合理的分工，公方代表和职工群众支持和帮助私方人员做出了成绩。在这些合营企业中，生产经营改进了，公私双方共事关系搞好了，私方人员的技能和经验发挥出来了，思想水平也逐步提高了，这是一种好的现象。但也还有很多的合营企业，私方人员的职权问题还没有得到正确的解决。公方代表和职工群众对私方人员的工作还缺乏积极的支持，私方人员还受到不同程度的冷遇，或者是公私双方存在着“相敬如宾”和“格格不入”的现象。公私双方的共事关系一般都是建立不久的，这种现象的存在并不奇怪。不过，如果这个问题不积极地解决，不仅会影响到私方人员的思想改造和积极作用的发挥，而且不利于企业的生产和经营。
    应当如何正确地认识私方人员的职权呢？
    必须看到，全行业公私合营和实行定息以后，企业生产关系发生了根本性的变化，私方人员现在在公私合营企业中的职权，已经同过去他们在资本主义企业中的职权不同了。
    在资本主义企业中，私方人员的职权是由于他们对生产资料的占有而来的——因为企业生产资料归资本家所有，所以就产生了资本家的职权。这种职权我们通常称作资本家的三权，就是：企业财产所有权，企业管理权和人事调配权。私方人员在企业中行使和利用这种职权来统治企业，追逐利润。在国家逐步地对资本主义工商业进行和平改造的过程中，国家一方面承认了资本家的三权，另方面又有必要对他们的三权加以限制和监督，并对他们的唯利是图的投机违法活动进行坚决的斗争。
    全行业公私合营和定息以后，私方人员在企业中的职权是另外一种完全不同的职权了。资方人员已经具有两重身分，一方面他们还是资本家，另一方面他们又是国家安排的企业公职人员。由于生产关系的改变，他们在企业中的职权已经不是以生产资料资本家所有制为基础的资本家的三权，而是国家给予的公职人员的职权。他们在企业中已经不是为私有制工作，而是为社会主义服务了。显然，私方人员行使这种公职人员的职权是受国家委托的，是符合工人阶级的利益的。因此，在公私合营企业中的公私关系，不仅是阶级关系，同时也是社会主义的工作关系。
    在这里，我们不仅应当认识私方人员职权的根本变化，同时还必须了解到这种变化的重大意义。这种变化说明了什么呢？（1）这种变化说明，资本主义生产关系有了根本的改变，资本家所有制虽然还没有最后被消灭，但这种所有制已不完整，而只是一个残余的所有制了。资本家对生产资料的所有权已经和使用权分割开来，他们已经不能再依靠这种所有权在企业中居于统治支配的地位。（2）这种变化标志着资方人员的消极作用受到更严格的限制，积极作用可以得到更大的发挥；标志着私方人员向自食其力劳动者的过渡。（3）这种变化更有利于把改造私方人员的思想同利用他们的技能、经验结合起来，更有利于从工作实践中来改造他们。
    使私方人员在合营企业中有职有权，以及督促他们在工作中尽职尽责，无论对私方人员的思想改造和企业的生产经营，都具有重要的意义。以企业为基地通过工作实践来改造私方人员，不只是在公私合营企业中安排私方人员的职务，更重要的是要在安排了职务之后，使他们在工作实践中受得锻炼，学习到社会主义的工作方法，并从实践中逐步提高他们的思想水平。私方人员应当力求通过工作实践努力自我改造，并在工作上有所贡献，做出成绩。从另一方面看，私方人员大多具有一定的业务技能和经验，其中有许多对国家是有用的。他们的专长是国家的一项财富。使他们的专长充分发挥出来，对搞好企业的生产经营是完全必要的。
    某些合营企业的公方代表和职工群众，对于使私方人员有职有权还存在着怀疑和抵触情绪。他们认为：如果使私方人员有职有权，不就是在资产阶级的领导下工作吗？显然，这种看法是片面的。在这里，我们不能把阶级关系和个人关系混为一谈。工人阶级的领导，在政治上表现为国家政权和政治路线的领导，在经济上表现为社会主义经济和国家计划的领导，具体到公私合营企业来说，还表现为政府业务部门和企业中党的领导。是不是把私方人员安排在企业领导职位上并使他们有职有权，就是受资产阶级的领导呢？当然不是的。（1）私方人员在企业中的职位是国家安排的，他们的职权是国家授予的，他们是在国家领导之下为社会主义工作的。（2）公私合营企业的业务工作是在政府业务部门领导下进行的，企业内部有党委领导下的集体负责制度。私方人员的工作必须服从国家的政策和计划，遵循党和国家的方针。他们不能够违犯党和国家的政策，滥用职权。（3）企业生产经营的管理是在职工群众的参加和支持下进行的。尊重私方人员的职权，并不是说要放弃对他们的资本主义经营思想和作风进行批评和教育，对他们的缺点和错误必须给予适当的批评，并帮助他们改正，使他们能够更好地为国家工作。我们必须认识到尊重私方人员的职权和工人阶级利益的一致性。使他们有职有权，充分发挥积极作用，不仅对改造私方人员思想是必要的，同时，对国家、对生产经营也都是有利的。
    现在问题就是这样：我们是要在社会主义工作实践中来改造资产阶级分子呢？还是只在口头上说改造他们，而实际上却放任不管或者“怕狼怕虎”呢？我们是要利用他们的经验和能力为国家服务呢？还是不加分析地把他们看成“包袱”呢？这不是很容易回答的吗？
    不可否认，当前有些私方人员还有某些消极情绪，如放弃自己应尽的责任，或者是怕负责任。有的人对过去压迫工人的错误还缺少认识，对工人还保持着命令主义的态度。有的自恃有一套办法，骄傲自满，没有认真学习群众路线的工作作风。这些都不能不影响到工人群众和私方人员的关系，影响到公私双方共事的关系。私方人员应当切实改变自己过去的旧的思想作风，主动地靠拢工人阶级，深入工作实际，把自己的业务知识同工人的实际经验结合起来，努力学习，争取公方代表和工人群众的支持和帮助，充分地贡献出自己的才能，为伟大的社会主义建设服务。
