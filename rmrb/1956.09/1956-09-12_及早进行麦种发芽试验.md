Suggestion:

    Conduct Wheat Seed Germination Tests Early
    During this year's summer harvest, continuous rain caused considerable damage to wheat. Much of it was ruined by the rain, or the quality was poor due to lack of selection and drying. According to inspections by six agricultural cooperatives in Hongmen Township, Xinxiang County, Henan Province, a significant number of production teams had wheat seeds in storage that were either infested with insects or had a germination rate as low as 20%. To ensure good wheat planting, we must immediately begin inspecting the storage of wheat seeds and conducting germination tests. Cui Weizeng

    及早进行麦种发芽试验
    今年夏收当中霪雨连绵，大部麦子被雨淋坏，或因没有选晒而质量不好。据河南新乡县鸿门乡六个农业社检查，不少生产队保管的麦种，有的生了虫，有的发芽率只有20％。为了保证种好小麦，必须立即动手检查麦种的保管，并且进行麦种的发芽试验。　崔维增
