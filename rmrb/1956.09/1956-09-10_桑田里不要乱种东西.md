    Don't Randomly Plant Things in Mulberry Fields
    The Wuxing area of Jiangsu is a place famous for its silk production. However, the cadres here are assigning the planting of various spring-flowering crops like barley, wheat, and broad beans, as well as miscellaneous grains like sorghum, corn, hemp, soybeans, and pumpkins. As a result, no matter how lush the mulberry fields, they are all planted with crops such as pumpkins, sorghum, hemp, and soybeans. One piece of land is surrounded on all sides by sorghum, with hemp planted in the middle, growing taller than the mulberry trees. Soybeans and other crops are planted between the mulberry trees, making it impossible to even get a hoe in.
    I am the accountant of the Xinhua Agricultural Production Cooperative. All 235 mu of mulberry fields in our cooperative have also been planted with many other things. Pumpkin vines have climbed onto the mulberry trees, making it impossible to see the mulberry leaves. Hemp planted in the mulberry fields makes the mulberry trees thin, yellow, and weak. When I talk to the cooperative members about this, they always sigh and say, "There's nothing to say. In another two or three years, the income from silkworm rearing will be gone."
    I hope that the government and technical extension departments will pay attention to this issue. When developing diversified operations, different requirements should be proposed according to different regions. Don't randomly plant spring-flowering crops and miscellaneous grains in mulberry fields. The grain quota tasks for silkworm rearing areas should be appropriately reduced or exempted.

### 桑田里不要乱种东西

    桑田里不要乱种东西
    江苏吴兴一带是盛产蚕桑的地方。但是，这里的干部却布置多种大麦、小麦、蚕豆等春花作物和高粱、玉米、麻、黄豆、南瓜等杂粮作物。这样一来，不管多茂盛的桑地，都种上了南瓜、高粱、麻、黄豆等作物。一块地，四面种上高粱包围着，中间种上麻，长得比桑树还高，桑树间又种上黄豆等其他作物，连锄头也伸不进去。
    我是新华农业生产合作社的会计员。我们社里的二百三十五亩桑田也都种上了别的许多东西。南瓜藤爬上了桑树，连桑叶也看不见了。麻种在桑地，使桑树瘦黄无力。我同社员谈这事的时候，他们总是叹口气说：“无啥说的，再隔二、三年，养蚕的收入也完了。”
    我希望政府和技术推广部门注意这个问题。发展多种经营的时候，应根据不同地区提出不同的要求，不要在桑田上乱种春花作物和杂粮。对养蚕地区的粮食三定任务，应该适当减免。黄祖法
