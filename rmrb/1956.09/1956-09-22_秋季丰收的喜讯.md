According to preliminary estimates from the Provincial Department of Agriculture, if no major disasters occur in the future, grain production could reach over 4.9 billion jin, an increase of more than 600 million jin compared to last autumn. Including the summer wheat harvest, the province's total grain output this year could increase by more than 2.5 billion jin compared to last year.

　　Early corn is growing well in most parts of the province. It is estimated that the yield per mu in the more than 1,000 mu of youth high-yield cornfields in the Yan'an Special District can reach over 1,000 jin. In Jiezhe River Township, Huanglong County, there are more than 21 mu of youth high-yield cornfields, and the estimated average yield per mu can reach over 2,000 jin. The more than 2 million mu of rice in the southern Shaanxi area also had a bumper harvest this year. It is estimated that the average yield of rice in the province can reach 560 jin per mu, an increase of more than 17% compared to last year. The sorghum in Shaanxi Province also grew particularly well this year, especially the more than 110,000 mu of sorghum in Fengxiang County. The ears are neat and the grains are full.

　　Liaoning Cotton Production Doubles

　　Xinhua News Agency Report: According to relevant officials from the Liaoning Provincial Department of Agriculture, the total cotton output in Liaoning Province this year will double compared to last year. The unit area yield can average 1,800 jin of seed cotton per hectare, an increase of more than 40% compared to last year. In major cotton-producing counties such as Gaiping, Haicheng, Yixian, Chaoyang, and Heishan, many agricultural cooperatives have also seen many large-area high-yield records of more than 3,000 jin of seed cotton per hectare. The quality of cotton in various places is also better than in previous years. The cotton wadding is snow-white, and there are fewer insect bites, red heads, and stiff petals than in previous years, and the villi are also longer. At present, cotton farmers in various places have generally begun to pick cotton.

　　Xinjiang Long-staple Cotton Plants Are Lush with Many Bolls

　　(Our Newspaper) News: This year, the Xinjiang Agricultural Production Corps' more than 11,000 mu of Grade 2 and Grade 3 long-staple cotton not only have lush plants and many bolls, but also the cotton bolls are larger than last year, and the yield is also greatly improved compared to last year. According to the appraisal, each mu of the 1,000 mu of long-staple cotton in the Turpan Cotton Planting Farm can yield 350 jin to 400 jin of seed cotton, and the more than 4,000 mu in the Aksu Forward Farm is estimated to yield 375 jin per mu. The floccuation period of long-staple cotton this year is generally 20 to 30 days earlier than last year. The 3,900 mu of long-staple cotton in the Victory Farm in the Aksu Reclamation Area has a floccuation period 36 days earlier than last year, and it is estimated that the pre-frost cotton can reach 80%. Now long-staple cotton has entered the peak flowering period, and various cotton planting farms are actively harvesting. (Production Frontline News)

　　Inner Mongolia Sugar Beet Reaps an Unprecedented Harvest

　　Xinhua News Agency Report: Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, one of China's three major sugar beet producing areas, has reaped an unprecedented sugar beet harvest this year. It is estimated that the total output of sugar beet in the region can reach 240,000 tons, with an average of 3,800 jin per mu, an increase of more than 700 jin per mu compared to last year.

　　After four years of trial planting and the consecutive bumper harvests of large-scale planting last year and this year, it shows that the sugar beet production in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has exceeded the major sugar beet producing areas of Heilongjiang Province and Jilin Province in terms of unit area yield and sugar content. The more than 60,000 mu of sugar beet planted in Tumote Banner this year can average more than 4,300 jin per mu, and the high-yield land of many agricultural cooperatives can harvest more than 10,000 jin per mu.

　　The person in charge of the Autonomous Region Agriculture and Animal Husbandry Department analyzed the reasons for the bumper harvest and said: Good weather is certainly one of the reasons for this year's bumper harvest, but more importantly, after the realization of agricultural cooperativization, farmers' ability to accept new technologies has been enhanced, and they have greater strength to resist natural disasters. This year, the density planting generally reached more than 5,000 plants per mu (less than 4,000 plants last year). Although the spring drought and sandstorms were greater than last year, the area of replanting was very small. Under the guidance of agricultural technology extension stations, farmers of all ethnic groups have been able to effectively control sugar beet pests. The person in charge said: The natural conditions in western Inner Mongolia are very suitable for growing sugar beet. If further attention is paid to deep plowing and moisture conservation, it is entirely possible to increase the average yield of sugar beet in the region to more than 4,000 jin per mu in one or two years.

　　In order to ensure the supply of raw materials for the state-owned Baotou Sugar Factory, farmers have begun to harvest sugar beet in advance and prepare to transport it to various sugar beet acquisition stations along the Beijing-Baotou Railway.

　　Jiangxi White Lotus Seed Production Increases

　　(Our Newspaper) News: Farmers in Guangchang County, Jiangxi, which is rich in "Tongxin White Lotus," are busy harvesting and processing white lotus seeds from morning to night during the harvest season. The characteristic of the lotus seeds produced here is that they are peeled and cored immediately after harvesting, becoming skinless and coreless white lotus seeds. The lotus skin and lotus heart left over after the lotus seeds are processed can be used as medicinal materials.

　　The county has more than 4,200 mu of lotus fields, and in the past, it harvested about 200,000 jin of lotus seeds every year. This year, due to the strengthening of cultivation work and the promotion of improved varieties by various agricultural cooperatives, the lotus seeds have generally increased by more than 10% compared to last year, and the county can produce 220,000 jin. The improved variety "Tie Lian" has more flowers, more seeds, and fuller seeds. However, in the past, only a few households such as Feng Yu Lian in Guanqiao Township planted it, and they had never passed it on for generations. After senior cooperativization, they contributed this improved variety; more than half of the lotus fields in the lotus producing area are planted with "Tie Lian".

　　At present, the seven acquisition stations in the lotus producing area are busy acquiring lotus seeds, packing them in wooden boxes, and transporting them to Nanchang, Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou and other places by trucks for domestic sales or export. (Tang Zhiguang)

　　Jiao County Chinese Cabbage Grows Well

　　(Our Newspaper) News: Jiao County Chinese cabbage is one of Shandong's specialties. It is famous for its characteristics of being fertile, delicious, and easy to cook, and sells well in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Northeast China, and some industrial and mining areas.

　　This year, agricultural cooperatives in the county have sown more than 10,000 mu of Chinese cabbage. Due to the strengthening of cultivation management, the current cabbage seedlings are growing well. Especially in Chengnan District, which is rich in Chinese cabbage, 3,500 mu of cabbage seedlings have grown as large as a plate, and the endless green leaves have covered the vegetable fields, and a bumper harvest is expected.

　　In order to help vegetable farmers apply top dressing in time, the Jiao County Supply and Marketing Cooperative has transferred 300,000 jin of cake fertilizer to the Chinese cabbage producing area. In order to strive for a bumper harvest of Chinese cabbage and ensure that more than 90% of its members increase their income, the agricultural cooperatives in Sanguanmiao Township, Chengnan District, have organized 50% of their labor force to invest in vegetable field management. At present, all 190,000 cabbage seedlings in the Qianjin Agricultural Cooperative in the township have been cultivated, weeded, and insects caught three times, and medicine sprayed three times.

　　Gan River Basin Sugarcane Expected to Have a Bumper Harvest

　　Xinhua News Agency Report: More than 330,000 mu of sugarcane in the Gan River Basin, Sichuan, are growing lush and dense, with tall and strong stalks, presenting a scene of a bumper harvest. The local sugarcane variety - Lushi Sugarcane matures earliest and can be harvested in about ten days. According to the person in charge of the Gan River Special Office Sugarcane Production Management Department to Xinhua News Agency reporters: This year, the sugarcane in the entire region will have the largest harvest since liberation. It is estimated that the total output can reach 2.4 billion jin.

　　Since last winter and this spring, 78% of the farmers in the Gan River Basin participated in agricultural cooperatives, and their enthusiasm for increasing sugarcane production has been high. The Neijiang Special District expanded the sugarcane field area by more than 49,000 mu, and 170,000 mu adopted improved sugarcane varieties. Close planting was generally carried out, and the general sugarcane fields were top-dressed one to two times more than last year. In order to ensure a bumper harvest, while preparing to harvest early-maturing sugarcane, agricultural cooperative members in various places are going deep into the sugarcane forest to inspect the harmful aphids.

    辽宁棉花增产一倍
    据新华社讯　据辽宁省农业厅有关负责人谈：辽宁省今年棉花总产量将比去年增加一倍，单位面积产量平均每公顷可以产籽棉一千八百斤，比去年增加四成多。主要产棉区盖平、海城、义县、朝阳、黑山等县许多农业社还出现了不少每公顷可以产籽棉三千斤以上的大面积高额丰产纪录。各地棉花的质量也比往年强，棉絮雪白，虫口、红头、僵瓣都比往年少，绒头也长。目前，各地种棉农民已经普遍开始拣花。
    新疆长绒棉株茂铃多
    本报讯　今年新疆农业生产部队一万一千余亩二与三长绒棉，不但株茂铃多，而且棉铃比去年的要大，产量比去年也大大提高。经鉴定吐鲁番植棉场的一千亩长绒棉，每亩可收籽花三百五十斤到四百斤，阿克苏前进农场的四千多亩，估计每亩可收三百七十五斤。今年长绒棉的吐絮期一般都比去年提早二十到三十天，阿克苏垦区胜利一场三千九百余亩长绒棉，比去年吐絮期提前了三十六天，估计霜前花可以达到百分之八十。现在长绒棉已进入盛花期，各植棉场正在积极收摘。　（生产战线报）
    内蒙古甜菜空前丰收
    据新华社讯　我国三大甜菜产区之一的内蒙古自治区，今年甜菜空前丰收。预计全区甜菜总产量可达二十四万吨，平均每亩达到三千八百斤，比去年每亩增产七百多斤。
    经过四年试种及去年、今年大面积种植连获丰收的结果表明：内蒙古自治区的甜菜生产在单位面积产量和含糖率方面已超过了主要甜菜产区的黑龙江省和吉林省，土默特旗今年种植的六万多亩甜菜，平均每亩可达四千三百多斤，很多农业社的丰产地每亩可收一万斤以上。
    自治区农牧厅负责人分析丰收的原因说：气候好固然是今年丰收的原因之一，但更重要的是实现农业合作化后，农民接受新技术的能力增强了，有较大的力量来抵抗自然灾害。今年密植一般都达到每亩五千株以上（去年还不到四千株）。今年虽然春旱风沙比去年大，但改种面积却很小。在农业技术推广站指导下，各族农民已能有效控制甜菜虫害。这位负责人说：内蒙古西部自然条件很适于种植甜菜，如果进一步注意深耕保墒，在一两年内使全区甜菜每亩平均产量提高到四千斤以上是完全可能的。
    为了保证供应国营包头糖厂的原料需要，农民们已开始提前收获甜菜，准备运送到京包铁路沿线的各个甜菜收购站去。
    江西白莲子增产
    本报讯　盛产“通心白莲”的江西广昌县的农民，在白莲子的收获季节里，从早到晚都在繁忙地进行着收获和加工工作。这里生产的莲子的特点是采摘后立即去皮去心，成为无皮无心的白莲子。莲子加工以后剩下的莲皮、莲心等，可作药材。
    全县共有莲田四千二百多亩，过去每年约收获莲子二十万斤。今年，由于各农业社加强了培育工作，推广了良种，莲子普遍比去年增产一成以上，全县可产二十二万斤。良种“铁莲”开花多、结籽多、籽饱满，可是，过去只有贯桥乡冯羽连等几户栽种，他们历代不曾外传。高级合作化以后，他们把这良种贡献了出来；在产莲地区一半以上莲田里都栽种了“铁莲”。
    目前，产莲区的七个收购站正在繁忙地进行收购，用木箱装好，一车车运往南昌、上海、北京、广州等地，内销或者出口。
