Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 2nd. A grand military parade and mass procession were held in Hanoi this morning to celebrate the 11th anniversary of the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

    Troops and parading masses passed through the tree-lined Ba Dinh Square, receiving the review of Vietnamese national leaders such as Ho Chi Minh, Truong Chinh, Ton Duc Thang, Pham Van Dong, Vo Nguyen Giap, and Phan Ke Toai. The parading masses carried huge maps of Vietnam, demonstrating their will to unify the motherland.

    The viewing stands on both sides of the rostrum were filled with representatives from all walks of life, inter-regions, and provinces of Vietnam, combat heroes and model workers, foreign envoys, distinguished guests, representatives of experts, and personnel from the International Commission. The entire Chinese cultural, educational, and health delegation, the Guangxi Provincial Minority Nationalities Delegation, and the Chinese Exhibition Group also attended the viewing.

    President Ho Chi Minh read his appeal to the people of the whole country at the celebration. He talked about the current international situation and the achievements of the Vietnamese people in various fields. He called on the people of the whole country to unite, work hard to consolidate the North, demand that the other party strictly implement the Geneva Accords, and resolutely struggle to achieve national reunification. When he said in his conclusion: "The strength of our people is great; the vitality of our system is abundant; the nature of our regime is beautiful... We will surely be able to overcome all difficulties, and our country will surely be unified!" a burst of enthusiastic cheers resounded in the square. People shouted "Long live President Ho", "Long live the reunification of the motherland", and "Long live the Democratic Republic of Vietnam."

    After Vo Nguyen Giap reviewed the troops and issued orders, the military parade began. Cadets from the Vietnam Army Officer School, appearing for the first time in the review, infantry who had made outstanding contributions in the Vietnam Liberation War, and the powerful coastal defense and border defense forces, the capital garrison, mechanized infantry, and artillery, passed the rostrum in succession to be reviewed.

    The parading masses followed the troops into the square. Countless gold star red flags, blue background white dove peace flags, and colorful flags formed a magnificent sea of flags.

    The workers' contingent held up various charts to report to the party and state leaders on the achievements they had made in the first half of this year: such as coal production reaching 584.7% of the same period last year; yarn production reaching 842.9% of the same period last year. Railway workers also pushed a small train carrying more than a dozen children, which was a model of the train for the opening ceremony of the Hanoi-Lao Cai railway.

    The peasant队伍, who had just completed land reform, held up eye-catching charts: more than eight million landless and land-poor peasants had been allocated land. The emancipated peasants also achieved a bumper harvest of summer rice this year, exceeding the planned target by 13%.

    Also participating in the parade were contingents of people and cadres who had withdrawn from South Vietnam to the North, youth contingents, young pioneer contingents, and contingents of various ethnic minorities in Vietnam dressed in colorful costumes, intellectuals, religious circles, overseas Chinese, women, industrialists and businessmen, and sports workers. Vietnamese artists performed various folk dances in the square. Bringing up the rear was the Soviet Ukrainian Art Troupe, which recently visited Vietnam and was warmly welcomed.

    At the end of the parade, President Ho Chi Minh waved to the cheering masses who surged towards the viewing stand and wished everyone success in completing the 1956 national plan.

    More than 100,000 citizens crowded the streets to watch and cheer the parading队伍。
