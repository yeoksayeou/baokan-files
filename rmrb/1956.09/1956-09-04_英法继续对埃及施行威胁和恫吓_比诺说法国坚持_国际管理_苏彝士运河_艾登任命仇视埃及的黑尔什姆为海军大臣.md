Xinhua News Agency, September 3rd Dispatch: Paris News: On September 2nd, the very day that the representatives of the "Five-Nation Committee" arrived in Egypt, French Foreign Minister Pineau delivered a speech at the agricultural exposition in Saint-Georges-de-Ragogne, France, once again emphasizing that the French government would force Egypt to accept the so-called "international control" plan for the Suez Canal proposed by Western countries at the London Conference.

Pineau described Egypt's actions to safeguard its sovereignty and reject Dulles' "international control" plan as the result of the Soviet Union "giving Egypt ideas." He also described the military intimidation actions taken by France in the Mediterranean region as necessary measures.

Xinhua News Agency, September 3rd Dispatch: London News: The British Admiralty was reorganized on September 3rd, with Prime Minister Eden appointing Lord Hailsham as First Lord of the Admiralty, replacing Kilmuir, who had resigned.

This personnel change at the Admiralty is considered a means by which the British government is intensifying pressure on Egypt. According to a United Press report, Hailsham is "an infantryman who fought in Egypt during World War II." Since the Suez Canal issue arose, he has consistently advocated taking a hard line against Egypt.

Many British newspapers, in commenting on Hailsham's appointment, asked anxiously in bold headlines: "Is this going to war with Egypt?"

Xinhua News Agency, September 3rd Dispatch: According to a Reuters London report: Citing the situation in the Suez Canal, the British government has advised British expatriates in Jordan and Syria, as well as the families of British Embassy staff in Cairo, to leave these countries.

    英法继续对埃及施行威胁和恫吓
    比诺说法国坚持“国际管理”苏彝士运河
    艾登任命仇视埃及的黑尔什姆为海军大臣
    据新华社3日讯　巴黎消息：9月2日，正是“五国委员会”代表到达埃及的同一天，法国外交部长比诺在法国圣乔治德拉古埃的农业博览会上发表演说，再次强调法国政府要迫使埃及接受西方国家在伦敦会议上提出的所谓“国际管理”苏彝士运河的计划。
    比诺把埃及维护主权、拒绝杜勒斯的“国际管理”计划的行动说成是苏联“给埃及出主意”的结果。他还把法国在地中海地区采取的军事恫吓行动说成是必要的措施。
    据新华社3日讯　伦敦消息：英国海军部9月3日进行改组，首相艾登任命黑尔什姆勋爵为海军大臣，原来担任这个职位的基耳肯宁已经辞职了。
    海军部这次人事调动被认为是英国政府对埃及加紧施行压力的一个手段。据合众社消息说，黑尔什姆是“在第二次世界大战中曾经在埃及作战的步兵”。在苏彝士运河问题发生以来，他一直主张采取强硬态度来对付埃及。
    英国许多报纸在评论黑尔什姆的任命时，都用黑体字的标题不安地问道：“这是要同埃及打仗吗？”
    据新华社3日讯　据路透社伦敦消息：英国政府已经以苏彝士运河的局势为理由，劝告在约旦和叙利亚的英国侨民以及英国驻开罗大使馆的工作人员的家属离开这些国家。
