    Proactively Overcoming the Difficulty of Steel Shortages
    Zhang Wei
    Since the beginning of this year, steel has been in short supply in the Wuhan market, causing difficulties in raw materials for many handicrafts production cooperatives producing ironware, hardware, wire, and round nails. Some production cooperatives have stopped work, and others have switched to other businesses; however, many production cooperatives have proactively sought ways to overcome the shortage of raw materials and maintain production. The Wuhan No. 3 Hardware Production Cooperative is one such example.
    The Wuhan No. 3 Hardware Production Cooperative mainly produces boilers, handcarts, mine cars, water tanks, and other items, requiring approximately 150 tons of steel each quarter. However, in the first quarter of this year, steel could not be purchased on the market, and the cooperative's reserves were also low. As a result, the cooperative was forced to stop work for an average of four days per month during this quarter. The cooperative director continuously requested assistance from higher authorities to resolve the raw material problem. However, the steel shortage was a national issue, and it was difficult for leading organizations to provide assistance. They could only provide general instructions: rely on the masses and proactively find ways to overcome the difficulties.
    Based on these instructions, the cooperative's staff discussed methods to overcome the current raw material difficulties. The first measure was to change from self-production and self-sales to processing for designated clients. When accepting orders, they mobilized clients to bring their own materials. In the second quarter, they took on processing tasks for five units, totaling 45 tons of steel. The cooperative also sent out more than ten people to do repair work on a regular basis.
    During their business dealings, they learned of channels for purchasing materials and sent people out to purchase them. They purchased a total of 7,000 kilograms of round iron and flat iron in Xiaogan County and Anlu County, Hubei Province. Recently, the cooperative sent people to Tong County, Handan, and certain counties in Guangxi to purchase steel, and also assigned one person to regularly search for used steel in the Wuhan market.
    An even more important method for overcoming the raw material shortage was to conserve steel and find substitutes. Starting from the second quarter, the entire cooperative launched a labor competition, making the conservation of raw materials and the utilization of waste materials important competition indicators. The red furnace team, which manufactures iron door hinges, originally used 2.5-inch round iron. Now, they use scrap steel plates left over from boiler making as a substitute. However, burning scrap steel plates takes more time than burning round iron (scrap steel needs to be melted, while round iron only needs to be heated), which can affect the completion of production plans. The workers in this team then found ways to reduce the idle time of the furnace and improve its utilization efficiency. In this way, the red furnace team still completed its production plan very well. In addition, they also used scrap flat steel, which was previously treated as waste, to replace iron for making washers (small iron plates for screwing on), and used ribbed steel to replace round iron for manufacturing bolts, etc. In the second quarter, they utilized a total of 2,755 kilograms of waste materials, saving materials worth more than 880 yuan. In July and early August, they saved materials worth 500 yuan. The effort to conserve raw materials not only solved part of the material shortage problem but also reduced product costs. For example, the cost of boilers was reduced by 35.8% compared to last year. The product quality was also good.
    Since the second quarter, the Wuhan No. 3 Hardware Production Cooperative has not stopped work for a single day. Currently, the cooperative's processing orders have been scheduled until October of this year.
    Although undertaking processing and repair work is not as profitable as self-production and self-sales, the cooperative has sufficient tasks, and in particular, members have found ways to save raw materials and reduce costs. As a result, this year's profits are not less than last year's profits from self-production and self-sales. The income of cooperative members has also increased compared to last year. Last year, the cooperative earned 30,000 yuan in profit, and in the first seven months of this year, it earned 19,000 yuan. Last year, the average monthly income per member was more than 50 yuan, and since May of this year, the average monthly income per member has been more than 60 yuan, and even increased to 73 yuan in July.

    主动克服了钢材缺乏的困难
    张碨
    今年年初以来，武汉市场上钢材十分缺乏，许多铁器、五金、铅丝、元钉等手工业生产合作社的原材料都发生了困难。有的生产合作社停了工，有的生产合作社转营其他业务；但是，也有不少生产合作社，主动想办法克服了原材料不足的困难，使生产维持了下来。武汉市第三五金生产合作社便是一个例子。
    武汉市第三五金生产合作社主要生产锅炉、手推车、矿车、水箱等物品，每个季度大约需要钢材一百五十吨左右。但是，今年第一季度在市场上买不到钢材，社里储备的材料也很少，因此，这一个季度每月平均停工四天。社主任曾经不断向上级要求帮助解决原材料问题。但是，缺乏钢材是全国性的问题，领导机关也很难帮助他们解决。他们只能作原则指示：依靠群众，主动设法克服困难。
    根据这些指示，这个社的工作人员讨论了克服目前原材料困难的办法。首先是把自产自销改为替定户加工。在接活的时候，他们就动员订户自己拿材料来。第二季度，他们共接了五个单位四十五吨钢材的加工任务。社里还派出十多个人经常出外做修理工作。
    他们在业务往来中，打听到采购材料的门路，就派人出去采购。他们在湖北省孝感县供销合作社、安陆县供销合作社两个地方共买回元铁、扁铁等七千公斤。最近，社里又派人到通县、邯郸以及广西某些县份去采购钢材，还抽出一个人经常在武汉市场搜集旧钢材。
    他们克服原材料不足的困难的更重要的办法，是节约钢材和寻找代用品。从第二季度起，全社展开了劳动竞赛，把节约原材料和利用废料作为重要的竞赛指标。红炉组制造铁门铰，原来是用二寸半的元铁，现在就拿做锅炉剩下来的零碎钢板来代替。但是，烧零碎钢板要比烧元铁费时间（碎钢要烧化，元铁只要烧红），会影响产量计划的完成。这个组的工人就想办法减少炉子的空闲时间，提高炉子的利用效率。这样，红炉组仍然很好地完成了产量计划。此外，他们还利用过去作为废料处理的扁材零星钢代替铁做华司（上螺丝钉的小铁夹板），利用竹节钢代替元铁制造螺栓等。第二季度，他们共利用了二千七百五十五斤废料，节约的材料值八百八十多元。7月份和8月上旬，又节约了价值五百元的材料。努力节约原材料的结果，不仅解决了一部分材料缺乏的困难，还降低了产品成本。如锅炉的成本就比去年降低了35.8％。产品质量也好。
    第二季度以来，武汉市第三五金生产合作社没有停一天工。现在，社里的加工订货任务已经安排到今年10月份了。
    虽然承接加工修理的业务，没有自产自销利润大，但是，由于社里的任务充足，特别是社员们设法节约了原材料，降低了成本，今年也不比去年自产自销时赢利少。社员们的收入还比去年增加了。去年社里赢利三万元，今年前七个月赢利一万九千元。社员们去年每人每月平均收入五十多元，今年5月份以来，每人每月的平均收入都在六十元以上，7月份还增加到七十三元。
