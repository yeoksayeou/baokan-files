Xinhua News Agency, September 16th: Zhou Enlai, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, delivered a "Report on the Proposal for the Second Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy" to the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China today on behalf of the Central Committee of the Party.

Zhou Enlai said that the first Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy is about to be successfully completed in just over a year. In order to enable us to smoothly start the construction of the Second Five-Year Plan immediately after the completion of the First Five-Year Plan, it is necessary to start the compilation of the Second Five-Year Plan as soon as possible. The Proposal for the Second Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy put forward by the Central Committee of the Party will be submitted to the State Council for discussion after being discussed and adopted by this Party Congress.

Before explaining the proposal for the Second Five-Year Plan, Zhou Enlai first introduced the basic situation of the implementation of the First Five-Year Plan in the first part of the report. He pointed out that since the implementation of the First Five-Year Plan, China's socialist construction and socialist transformation have achieved faster and greater victories than expected. He said that in terms of capital construction, it is estimated that by the end of 1957, the national investment in capital construction may exceed the original plan by more than 10%; it is estimated that nearly five hundred new and rebuilt industrial enterprises above the quota will be completed, thus beginning to change the original extremely backward state of China's industry. In terms of industrial production, it is estimated that by 1957, the total industrial output value may exceed the original plan by about 15%, and the output of major industrial products will mostly exceed the original planned targets. In terms of agricultural production, although many areas suffered serious natural disasters in 1956, the total national grain output this year may still reach the level stipulated in the First Five-Year Plan for 1957. As long as no particularly serious natural disasters occur in the next year or so, the output of major grain crops and some cash crops in 1957 may exceed the original plan.

Zhou Enlai said that the implementation and over-fulfillment of the First Five-Year Plan have already brought about and will bring about profound changes in China's national economy. This is mainly manifested in: the production level of industry and agriculture has been greatly improved. It is estimated that by 1957, the total output value of industry and agriculture will increase by more than 60% compared with 1952. In the total output value of industry and agriculture, the proportion of total industrial output value will reach about 50%, and in the total industrial output value, the proportion of the output value of means of production industry will reach more than 40%, which strengthens the leading role of industry in the national economy. As the cause of socialist transformation has achieved a decisive victory, socialist economic components have been in an absolutely dominant position in industry, agriculture, transportation, and commerce. With the above-mentioned changes, a thriving scene has appeared in all departments of the national economy, and the cause of cultural education and scientific research is also entering a prosperous period, thus creating conditions for the continued improvement of people's living standards.

Zhou Enlai pointed out that the reason why we have been able to achieve such great achievements in the past few years is the result of the united efforts of the people of all ethnic groups, all democratic parties, and all patriotic people under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, and also the result of the great assistance given to our country by the great Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. He said that we would like to take this opportunity to express our deep gratitude for this sincere brotherly assistance from the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries.

Zhou Enlai then put forward several more prominent issues that he felt in leading economic work in recent years. These issues are: (1) The development speed of the national economy should be reasonably stipulated according to needs and possibilities, and the plan should be placed on a foundation that is both active and stable and reliable to ensure the relatively balanced development of the national economy. (2) Key construction should be combined with overall arrangements so that all departments of the national economy can develop proportionally. (3) Reserve forces should be increased and a sound material reserve system should be established. (4) The relationship between economy and finance should be correctly handled. Zhou Enlai put forward some opinions on the above issues based on the experience and lessons learned.

Next, Zhou Enlai explained the basic tasks of China's Second Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy.

Zhou Enlai said that the Central Committee of the Party believes that the compilation of China's Second Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy should take the achievements that the First Five-Year Plan may achieve as a starting point, link to the basic requirement that China should complete the overall task of the transition period around the end of the Third Five-Year Plan, and realistically estimate the various domestic and foreign conditions during the Second Five-Year Plan period to carry out comprehensive planning. Only such a plan can be an active, stable, and reliable plan.

Zhou Enlai said that the Central Committee of the Party proposed that the basic tasks of China's Second Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy should be: (1) Continue to carry out industrial construction centered on heavy industry, promote the technological transformation of the national economy, and establish a solid foundation for China's socialist industrialization; (2) Continue to complete socialist transformation and consolidate and expand collective ownership and ownership by the whole people; (3) On the basis of developing capital construction and continuing to complete socialist transformation, further develop the production of industry, agriculture, and handicrafts, and correspondingly develop the transportation and commerce industries; (4) Strive to cultivate construction talents and strengthen scientific research to meet the needs of socialist economic and cultural development; (5) On the basis of the development of industrial and agricultural production, strengthen national defense and improve the material and cultural living standards of the people.

Zhou Enlai pointed out that in order to establish a solid foundation for China's socialist industrialization, it is necessary to continue to expand the construction of the metallurgical industry, vigorously promote the construction of the machine-building industry, strengthen the construction of the power industry, the coal industry, and the building materials industry, and actively carry out the construction of the backward departments in the industry—the petroleum industry, the chemical industry, and the radio industry during the Second Five-Year Plan period. At the same time, it is also necessary to promote the technological transformation of the national economy, first of all, the technological transformation of heavy industry, to improve the technological level of China's industry. He also pointed out that industrial construction centered on heavy industry cannot and should not be carried out in isolation. It must have the cooperation of all aspects, especially the cooperation of agriculture. He said that in order to make the various departments and aspects of the national economy develop proportionally and in a coordinated manner, we should properly arrange the relationship between heavy industry and light industry, the relationship between industrial and agricultural production and transportation and commodity circulation, the relationship between economic construction and cultural construction, and the relationship between national construction and people's lives; at the same time, we should further arrange the relationship between the central and local governments, the relationship between coastal areas and inland areas, and the relationship between various ethnic groups, so as to organize all positive factors and useful forces into the great cause of building socialism.

Zhou Enlai said that during the Second Five-Year Plan period, China's capital construction and industrial and agricultural production will likely continue to maintain a relatively fast development speed. On the basis of increased fiscal revenue, the proportion of national capital construction investment in total fiscal revenue will increase from about 35% in the first five years to about 40%, so the amount of capital construction investment in the second five years will increase by about one time compared with the first five years. In terms of industrial and agricultural production, preliminary calculations show that in 1962, the total industrial output value will increase by about one time compared with 1957, and the total agricultural output value will increase by about 35%. By 1962, China's total industrial and agricultural output value will increase by about 75% compared with the figure stipulated in the First Five-Year Plan for 1957. Zhou Enlai said that the above-mentioned scale of capital construction and the development speed of industrial and agricultural production are reasonable and are active, stable, and reliable. We can expect that in the future, as long as no particularly serious natural disasters and unexpected events occur, and through the efforts of the people of the whole country, the Second Five-Year Plan will also likely be over-fulfilled like the First Five-Year Plan.

In the third part of the report, Zhou Enlai made a brief explanation of several major issues in the proposal for the Second Five-Year Plan. These include reasonably accumulating and distributing funds, correctly arranging the capital construction plan, developing industrial production, developing agricultural production, developing the transportation and postal and telecommunications industries, strengthening commercial work, enterprise reorganization and personnel arrangements in the process of socialist transformation, improving the national administrative system and giving play to the enthusiasm of local governments, cultivating construction talents and strengthening scientific research, further improving people's lives, continuing to practice thrift, striving for international support, and expanding international economic, technological, and cultural cooperation and exchanges, and other twelve issues.

Zhou Enlai pointed out that when distributing and redistributing national income, it is necessary to maintain an appropriate ratio between the consumption part and the accumulation part. During the Second Five-Year Plan period, national income will likely increase by about 50% compared with the First Five-Year Plan. The proportion of the accumulation part in the national income can be slightly higher than the level already reached in the first five years.

When talking about the issue of correctly arranging the capital construction plan, Zhou Enlai emphasized that it is necessary to strengthen the construction of the machine-building industry and the metallurgical industry, pay attention to the rational distribution of productive forces, and combine large-scale enterprises with medium-sized and small enterprises.

Zhou Enlai said that the Central Committee of the Party proposed that in 1962, the total industrial output value should increase by about one time compared with the original plan for 1957. He explained in detail several important issues in the development of industrial production, namely, the issue of giving full play to the production potential of industrial enterprises, the issue of promoting the specialization and collaboration of industrial production, and the issue of improving product quality and increasing product types.

Zhou Enlai talked about the relevant issues in China's Second Five-Year Plan for developing agricultural production. He said that the Central Committee of the Party proposed in the proposal for the Second Five-Year Plan: the total grain output in five years should reach 2.2 trillion jin, and reach about 500 billion jin in 1962; in 1962, the total agricultural output value should increase by about 35% compared with the original plan for 1957. These indicators are proposed based on the specific situation of agriculture in China's Second Five-Year Plan period, and are therefore appropriate. We should make full use of various favorable conditions to promote greater development of agricultural production. Zhou Enlai pointed out that in order to develop agricultural production, we should pay special attention to two issues, namely, the issue of increasing the unit area yield of crops and the issue of developing diverse agricultural economies.

Zhou Enlai said that during the Second Five-Year Plan period, with the development of industrial and agricultural production, the expansion of the scale of capital construction, and the development and construction of inland and remote areas, it is necessary to greatly increase transportation and communication capabilities. This requires focusing on railway construction and correspondingly carrying out the construction of the national transportation network and communication network. Therefore, the transportation and postal and telecommunications departments should make overall plans according to priorities and urgencies to ensure the completion of the various tasks related to transportation and postal and telecommunications proposed in the proposal for the Second Five-Year Plan.

When talking about strengthening commercial work, Zhou Enlai said that according to rough calculations, the quantity of various daily necessities and a portion of the means of production supplied to urban and rural people in 1962, that is, the total retail sales of social commodities, will increase by about 50% compared with the original plan for 1957. The commercial department must continue to strengthen procurement and sales work, rationally arrange commercial institutions at all levels, and plan to organize a portion of free markets under the leadership of the state to meet the growing needs of the people. He also said that during the First Five-Year Plan period, prices in China's market were generally stable, and the ratio between industrial products and agricultural products was generally appropriate, which shows that our price policy is correct. During the Second Five-Year Plan period, we will continue to adopt a stable policy on prices, and at the same time, make appropriate adjustments to some unreasonable prices.

Zhou Enlai then talked about the issue of enterprise reorganization and personnel arrangements in the process of socialist transformation. He pointed out that small factories, handicrafts, and small commercial cooperative organizations have relatively flexible production and operation and are easy to adapt to the diverse and constantly changing needs of the people. Therefore, in the process of carrying out socialist transformation on them, they should maintain their decentralized characteristics and avoid the bias of excessive concentration. For industrial and commercial capitalists and small owners, after their enterprises are implemented with joint state-private ownership, they should be properly arranged and their production technology and management experience should be utilized.

Zhou Enlai said that during the Second Five-Year Plan period, many of the country's construction undertakings will be more responsible for or rely on the efforts of local governments. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the national administrative system to facilitate the enthusiasm of local governments. In the report, Zhou Enlai put forward various principles for dividing the administrative management powers of the central and local governments. He said that the central issue is to appropriately expand the powers of local governments under the unified leadership of the central government. He particularly pointed out that in this regard, we must pay more attention to the work of ethnic minorities in accordance with the provisions of the proposal.

When talking about strengthening scientific research work, Zhou Enlai said that recently, under the direct leadership of the Central Committee of the Party and the State Council, hundreds of outstanding scientists from across the country have been gathered to draft the national science and technology development plan and the philosophy and social science development plan for the next twelve years. He pointed out that this is an extremely important measure to ensure that many important scientific fields in our country can approach the world's advanced level in the next twelve years. We should complete these two plans as soon as possible and organize the national scientific research forces to implement the tasks proposed in these two plans step by step and with emphasis.

Zhou Enlai said that we must gradually improve people's lives while ensuring the gradual expansion of the scale of national construction. He said that during the second five years, the average wage of workers and staff will increase by 25% to 30%. In addition, practical measures should be taken to gradually improve the conditions of workers and staff in terms of housing, safety, medical and health care, and appropriately increase other welfare facilities; we should continue to oppose the bureaucratic attitude of indifference to the lives of workers and staff. In order to improve the material life of farmers, we should correctly solve the issue of farmers' burdens and the issue of the distribution of cooperative profits. In this way, during the Second Five-Year Plan period, if the agricultural production increase plan can be completed, it will be possible for the total income of farmers to increase by 25% to 30% in five years.

Zhou Enlai said that during the Second Five-Year Plan period, due to the expansion of the scale of national construction, we will still encounter many difficulties in terms of manpower, material resources, and financial resources. He pointed out that all state organs, state-owned enterprises, institutions, and cooperatives should practice thrift to make full use of human, material, and financial resources to accelerate the socialist construction of our country.

Zhou Enlai then pointed out that in order to complete our socialist construction, in addition to mobilizing all positive factors in the country, we must also strive for all favorable conditions internationally. For this reason, we have always worked hard to strengthen economic cooperation with the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, and support each other. We also strive to develop economic cooperation, trade exchanges, and cultural and technological exchanges with countries with different social systems, especially with Asian and African countries, for the same reason. He said that our advocacy of expanding international economic, technological, and cultural cooperation and exchanges is not only to accelerate the advancement of our socialist construction, but also because this will lay a reliable foundation for peaceful coexistence among countries.

In concluding his report, Zhou Enlai said that the day of the successful completion of the First Five-Year Plan and the start of the Second Five-Year Plan is not far away. He called on all comrades of the Party to redouble their efforts under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong in the next year or so, and together with the workers, peasants, and intellectuals of the whole country, and together with all ethnic groups, all parties, and all patriotic people in the country, to strive to over fulfill the First Five-Year Plan and actively prepare for the Second Five-Year Plan. He said that as long as we are modest and prudent, not arrogant and impetuous, and correct our subjective and bureaucratic styles of work, we will be able to mobilize all forces, overcome various difficulties, and advance victoriously in the struggle to build our country into a great socialist industrial power!

    在中国共产党第八次全国代表大会上
    周恩来作关于第二个五年计划的建议的报告
    新华社16日讯　中国共产党中央委员会书记处书记周恩来今天代表党中央委员会向中国共产党第八次全国代表大会作了“关于发展国民经济的第二个五年计划的建议的报告”。
    周恩来说，我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划，再经过一年多的时间，就要胜利地完成了。为了使我们能够在第一个五年计划完成以后，立即顺利地开始进行第二个五年计划的建设，就有必要及早着手进行第二个五年计划的编制工作。党中央委员会提出的关于发展国民经济的第二个五年计划的建议经过这次党代表大会讨论并且通过以后，将提交国务院讨论。
    在说明第二个五年计划的建议以前，周恩来首先在报告的第一部分介绍了关于执行第一个五年计划的基本情况。他指出，第一个五年计划执行以来，我国社会主义建设工作和社会主义改造工作都取得了比预想还快还大的胜利。他说，在基本建设方面，预计到1957年底，全国基本建设的投资额，有可能比原计划超额完成10％以上；预计有近五百个新建和改建的限额以上的工业企业建设完工，从而开始改变我国工业原来极端落后的面貌。在工业生产方面，预计到1957年，工业总产值将有可能比原计划超额完成15％左右，主要工业产品的产量，绝大多数都将超过原定的计划指标。在农业生产方面，1956年，虽然许多地区遭受了严重的自然灾害，但是这一年全国的粮食总产量，仍然有可能达到第一个五年计划规定的1957年的水平。只要今后一年多的时间内不发生特大的自然灾害，1957年主要的粮食作物和某些经济作物的产量，就有可能超额完成原定的计划。
    周恩来说，第一个五年计划的执行和它的超额完成，已经使并且将要使我国国民经济发生深刻的变化。这主要表现在：工农业的生产水平有很大的提高。预计到1957年，工农业总产值将比1952年增加60％以上。在工农业总产值中，工业总产值的比重将达到50％左右，而在工业总产值中，生产资料工业产值的比重将达到40％以上，这就加强了工业在国民经济中的领导作用。由于社会主义改造事业取得了决定性的胜利，无论在工业、农业、运输业和商业中，社会主义的经济成分都已经处于绝对统治的地位。有了上述这些变化，国民经济的各个部门都出现了欣欣向荣的景象，文化教育和科学研究的事业，也正在进入一个繁荣时期，因而也就为人民生活水平的继续提高创造了条件。
    周恩来指出，我们在过去几年中所以能够取得这样伟大的成就，是全国各族人民、各民主党派和一切爱国人士在中国共产党领导下团结努力的结果，也是伟大的苏联和各人民民主国家给予我国巨大援助的结果。他说，我们愿意乘这个机会，对于苏联和各人民民主国家的这种真诚的兄弟般的援助，表示深切的感谢。
    周恩来接着提出了近年来在领导经济工作中间所感到的几个比较突出的问题。这些问题是：（一）应该根据需要和可能，合理地规定国民经济的发展速度，把计划放在既积极、又稳妥可靠的基础上，以保证国民经济比较均衡地发展。（二）应该使重点建设和全面安排相结合，以便国民经济各部门能够按比例地发展。（三）应该增加后备力量，健全物资储备制度。（四）应该正确地处理经济和财政的关系。周恩来对以上问题，根据已经取得的经验和教训，提出了一些意见。
    接着，周恩来说明我国发展国民经济的第二个五年计划的基本任务。
    周恩来说，党中央委员会认为，编制我国发展国民经济的第二个五年计划，应该以第一个五年计划可能达到的成就作为出发点，联系到大约在第三个五年计划期末我国要完成过渡时期的总任务这个基本要求，并且实事求是地估计到第二个五年计划期间国内外的各种条件，进行全面的规划。这样的计划，才有可能是积极而又稳妥可靠的计划。
    周恩来说，党中央委员会提出，我国发展国民经济的第二个五年计划的基本任务应该是：（1）继续进行以重工业为中心的工业建设，推进国民经济的技术改造，建立我国社会主义工业化的巩固基础；（2）继续完成社会主义改造，巩固和扩大集体所有制和全民所有制；（3）在发展基本建设和继续完成社会主义改造的基础上，进一步发展工业、农业、手工业的生产，相应地发展运输业和商业；（4）努力培养建设人材，加强科学研究工作，以适应社会主义经济文化发展的需要；（?5）在工业农业生产发展的基础上，增强国防力量，提高人民的物质生活和文化生活的水平。
    周恩来指出，为了建立我国社会主义工业化的巩固基础，在第二个五年计划期间，必须继续扩大冶金工业的建设，大力推进机器制造工业的建设，加强电力工业、煤炭工业和建筑材料工业的建设，积极进行工业中的落后部门——石油工业、化学工业和无线电工业的建设。同时，还必须推进国民经济的技术改造，首先是进行重工业的技术改造，以提高我国工业的技术水平。他并且指出，以重工业为中心的工业建设，是不能够也不应该孤立地进行的，它必须有各个方面的配合，特别是农业的配合。他说，为了使国民经济的各个部门和各个方面按比例地、互相协调地发展，我们又应该妥善地安排重工业和轻工业之间的关系，工农业生产和运输、商品流转之间的关系，经济建设和文化建设之间的关系，国家建设和人民生活之间的关系；同时，还应该进一步地安排中央和地方之间的关系，近海地区和内地之间的关系，各个民族之间的关系，以便把一切积极的因素和有用的力量都组织到建设社会主义的伟大事业中来。
    周恩来说，在第二个五年计划期间，我国的基本建设和工农业生产将有可能继续保持比较快的发展速度。在财政收入增加的基础上，国家的基本建设投资在全部财政收入中所占的比重，将从第一个五年的35％左右增加到40％左右，因而第二个五年的基本建设投资额，就将比第一个五年增长一倍左右。在工农业生产方面，初步计算，1962年比1957年，工业总产值将增长一倍左右，农业总产值将增长35％左右。到1962年，我国工农业总产值将比第一个五年计划规定的1957年的数字增长75％左右。周恩来说，上述关于基本建设的规模和工农业生产的发展速度，是合理的，是积极而又稳妥可靠的。我们可以预期，在将来，只要不发生特大的自然灾害和意外事件，经过全国人民的努力，第二个五年计划也会像第一个五年计划那样，有可能超额地完成。
    在报告的第三部分，周恩来对第二个五年计划建议的若干主要问题扼要地作了说明。其中包括合理地积累和分配资金，正确地安排基本建设计划，发展工业生产，发展农业生产，发展运输业和邮电业，加强商业工作，社会主义改造过程中的企业改组和人员安排，改进国家行政体制、发挥地方的积极性，培养建设人才和加强科学研究工作，进一步改善人民生活，继续厉行节约，争取国际支援、扩大国际间经济、技术和文化的合作和联系等十二个问题。
    周恩来指出，在分配和再分配国民收入的时候，必须使消费部分和积累部分保持适当的比例。在第二个五年计划期间，国民收入将有可能比第一个五年计划增长50％左右。积累部分在国民收入中所占的比重，可以稍高于第一个五年已经达到的水平。
    在谈到正确地安排基本建设计划问题的时候，周恩来强调指出：必须加强机器制造工业和冶金工业的建设，注意生产力的合理分布，使大型企业和中、小型企业相结合。
    周恩来说，党中央委员会建议，1962年比1957年原计划，工业总产值应该增长一倍左右。他详细地说明了发展工业生产的几个重要问题，即发挥工业企业的生产潜力问题，推进工业生产的专业化和协作问题，提高产品质量和增加产品种类问题。
    周恩来谈到我国第二个五年计划发展农业生产方面的有关问题。他说，党中央委员会在关于第二个五年计划的建议中提出：粮食产量五年合计达到二万二千亿斤，1962年达到五千亿斤左右；1962年比1957年原计划，农业总产值增长35％左右。这些指标是根据我国第二个五年计划期内农业的具体情况提出的，因而是适当的。我们应该充分利用各种有利的条件，促进农业生产的更大发展。周恩来指出，为了发展农业生产，应该特别注意两个问题，即提高农作物的单位面积产量问题和发展多种农业经济问题。
    周恩来说，在第二个五年计划期间，随着工农业生产的发展，基本建设规模的扩大，内地和边远地区的开发和建设，都需要大大地增加运输和通讯的能力，这就必须以铁路建设为重点，相应地进行全国运输网和通讯网的建设。因此，运输和邮电部门应该分别轻重缓急，进行全面规划，以保证完成第二个五年计划建议中所提出的关于运输、邮电方面的各项任务。
    在谈到加强商业工作的时候，周恩来说，根据大体计算，1962年供应城乡人民的各种日常生活消费品和一部分生产资料的数量，即社会商品零售总额，将比1957年原计划增长50％左右。商业部门必须继续加强收购工作和销售工作，合理地安排各级商业机构，并且有计划地组织一部分在国家领导下的自由市场，以满足人民日益增长的需要。他又说，在第一个五年计划期间，我国市场的物价一般是稳定的，工业品和农业品之间的比价大体是适当的，这表明，我们的物价政策是正确的。在第二个五年计划期间，我们在物价方面将继续采取稳定的政策，同时，对某些不合理的物价进行适当的调整。
    周恩来接着谈到了关于社会主义改造过程中的企业改组和人员安排的问题。他指出，小型工厂、手工业和小商业的合作组织，他们的生产经营都比较机动灵活，容易适应于人民多样的、经常变化的需要，因此，在对他们进行社会主义改造的过程中，应该使他们保持分散的特点，避免过分集中的偏向。对于工商业资本家和小业主，在他们的企业实行公私合营以后，应该加以适当的安排，并且利用他们的生产技术和经营管理经验。
    周恩来说，在第二个五年计划期间，国家的许多建设事业将要更多地由地方负责兴办或者要依靠地方的努力配合来完成，因此，需要改进国家的行政体制，以利于地方积极性的发挥。周恩来在报告中提出了划分中央和地方的行政管理职权的各项原则，他说，中心的问题是在中央的统一领导下，适当地扩大地方的权限。他特别指出，在这方面要按照建议的规定，更加重视少数民族的工作。
    在讲到加强科学研究工作的时候，周恩来说，最近在党中央和国务院的直接领导下，集合了全国几百名优秀的科学家，草拟了今后十二年的全国科学技术发展规划和哲学社会科学发展规划。他指出，这是保证我国许多重要的科学方面在今后十二年内能够接近世界上先进水平的极重要的措施，应该早日完成这两个规划，并且组织全国科学研究的力量，有步骤地和有重点地实现这两个规划所提出的任务。
    周恩来说，我们必须在保证国家建设规模逐步扩大的同时，使人民生活得到逐步的改善。他说，在第二个五年期间，职工的平均工资将提高25％到30％。此外，还应该采取实际措施，逐步地改善职工居住、安全、医药卫生等方面的条件和适当地增加其他的福利设施；应该继续反对对职工生活漠不关心的官僚主义态度。为了改善农民的物质生活，我们应该正确地解决农民的负担问题和合作社收益的分配问题。这样，在第二个五年计划期间，如果能够完成农业的增产计划，就有可能使农民的全部收入在五年内增长25％到30％。
    周恩来说，在第二个五年计划期间，由于国家建设规模的扩大，我们在人力、物力、财力方面还会遇到很多困难。他指出，一切国家机关、国营企业、事业单位和合作社，都应该厉行节约，使人力、物力、财力都能够充分发挥作用，以加速我国社会主义的建设事业。
    周恩来接着指出，为了完成我们的社会主义建设事业，我们除了调动国内的一切积极因素以外，还必须争取国际上的一切有利条件。正因为这样，我们一贯努力加强同苏联和各人民民主国家的经济协作，并且互相支援。我们也为了同样的理由，努力发展同那些不同社会制度的各国、特别是同亚非各国的经济合作、贸易来往、文化和技术的交流。他说，我们主张扩大国际间经济、技术和文化的合作和联系，不仅是为了加速推进我们的社会主义建设事业，而且还因为这将为各国之间的和平共处奠定可靠的基础。
    周恩来在结束他的报告时说，第一个五年计划胜利完成和第二个五年计划开始的日子，已经不远了。他号召全党同志，在今后一年多的时间里，应该在党的中央委员会和毛泽东同志的领导下，加倍努力，同全国工人、农民、知识分子一起，同全国各民族、各党派、一切爱国人士一起，为超额完成第一个五年计划和积极准备第二个五年计划而奋斗。他说，只要我们谦虚谨慎，不骄不躁，纠正我们工作中的主观主义思想和官僚主义作风，我们就能够动员一切力量，克服各种困难，在把我国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义工业强国的奋斗中，胜利前进！
