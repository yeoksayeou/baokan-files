Xinhua News Agency, 6th - The Soviet members and staff of the Sino-Soviet mixed mountaineering team left Beijing today to return to their country.

	In the morning, Chinese mountaineers and staff saw off their close partners with whom they had lived for a long time at the airport. They warmly embraced and kissed the Soviet mountaineers and staff, wishing each other new achievements in their future work.

	Since arriving in Beijing on August 30, the Soviet mountaineers and staff have been warmly welcomed by the people of Beijing.

	Two cameramen from the Soviet Moscow Central Documentary Film Studio who came to Beijing with the mountaineering team – Soviet Honored Athlete A.I. Sidorenko and I.G. Grek – filmed some of the Chinese mountaineers in their daily work. Sidorenko and Grek told Xinhua reporters that the colorful documentary of the Sino-Soviet mountaineers conquering Muztagh Ata, which they co-produced, will be completed around the October Revolution Day this year.

	According to Shi Zhanchun, deputy leader of the Sino-Soviet mixed mountaineering team, the future work of the Chinese mountaineers is to summarize the experience of this mountaineering expedition. They are also preparing to hold exhibitions and report meetings. A Chinese national flag and a Soviet national flag planted by the Sino-Soviet mixed mountaineering team on Muztagh Ata, as well as the rocks, plant specimens, and mountaineering equipment they collected near Muztagh Ata, will be displayed at the exhibition. The documentary about climbing Muztagh Ata, produced by Chen Deyu and Zhou Feng, cameramen from the Central News Documentary Film Studio, will be released to Beijing audiences around September 10.

	Xinhua News Agency, 6th - Xinhua reporter Yang Kexian reports: Bereczky, the leader of the Sino-Soviet mixed mountaineering team, praised the young Chinese mountaineers in an interview with reporters before leaving Beijing.

	Bereczky said that the cooperation between Soviet and Chinese mountaineers began last year. In August of last year, four Chinese athletes successfully climbed Mount October (6,780 meters above sea level) and Mount Unity (6,773 meters above sea level), which was jointly named by Chinese and Soviet athletes, together with Soviet athletes. At that time, it was already evident that Chinese athletes worked very hard to learn mountaineering techniques and knowledge, and they mastered mountaineering techniques and knowledge very quickly.

	Bereczky said that since the beginning of this year, Chinese mountaineers have undergone more arduous training in Beijing and Taibai Mountain in Shaanxi Province, as well as in the Caucasus region of the Soviet Union. In June, when the Sino-Soviet mountaineers victoriously climbed Mount Elbrus, the highest peak in Europe, it foreshadowed that Chinese athletes would be able to climb Muztagh Ata (7,546 meters above sea level), one of the world's highest peaks.

	Bereczky said that during the ascent of Muztagh Ata, despite the many difficulties encountered, all twelve Chinese athletes reached the summit of Muztagh Ata. Later, two more Chinese athletes reached the summit of Mount Kongur Tiube (7,595 meters above sea level).

	He said that these facts show that Chinese athletes have become very promising mountaineers. In this mountaineering expedition, the Chinese team demonstrated their ability to organize mountaineering activities and the resourcefulness and courage that mountaineers should possess. Therefore, he believes that Chinese athletes will be able to climb many of the world's peaks that have not yet been conquered.

	Bereczky finally said that, like other traditional cooperation between China and the Soviet Union, the cooperation and friendship between the mountaineers of the two countries will become increasingly close.

    苏联爬山队员离京回国
    别列次基发表谈话称赞我国爬山运动员体育新闻
    据新华社6日讯　中、苏混合爬山队的苏联队员和工作人员，今天离开北京回国。
    早晨，中国爬山队员和工作人员在飞机场送别了同他们长时期生活在一起的亲密的伙伴们。他们同苏联爬山队员和工作人员热烈地拥抱、亲吻，互祝彼此在今后工作中取得新的成就。
    苏联爬山队员和工作人员从8月30日到北京以后，受到北京市人民的热烈欢迎。
    随爬山队来北京的苏联莫斯科中央纪录电影制片厂的两名摄影师——苏联功勋运动员阿·伊·西多连科和伊·格·格列克，把部分中国爬山队员在日常工作时的情形拍入了镜头。西多连科和格列克对新华社记者说，他们两人合拍的中、苏爬山队员征服慕士塔格山的五彩纪录片，将在今年十月革命节前后完成。
    据中、苏混合爬山队副队长史占春说，中国爬山队员今后的工作是总结这次爬山的经验。他们还准备举办展览会和报告会。中、苏混合爬山队插在慕士塔格山上的一面中国国旗和一面苏联国旗，以及他们在慕士塔格山附近搜集的岩石、植物标本和他们用的爬山装备等，都将在展览会上展出。中央新闻纪录电影制片厂摄影师陈德禹和周峰摄制的攀登慕士塔格山的纪录片，将在9月10日前后和北京市观众见面。
    新华社6日讯　新华社记者杨克现报道：中、苏混合爬山队队长别列次基在离开北京以前，向记者发表谈话，称赞年青的中国爬山运动员。
    别列次基说，苏联爬山运动员和中国爬山运动员的合作，从去年就开始了。去年8月，有四名中国运动员和苏联运动员一起，成功地攀登了苏联境内的十月峰（拔海六千七百八十公尺）和中、苏运动员共同命名的团结峰（拔海六千七百七十三公尺）。那时候已经可以看出，中国运动员学习爬山技术和知识非常努力，他们掌握爬山技术和知识也很快。
    别列次基说，今年以来，中国爬山运动员在北京和陕西省的太白山，以及苏联的高加索一带，进行了更艰苦的锻炼。6月间，当中、苏爬山队员胜利地攀登上了欧洲最高峰——厄尔布鲁士峰以后，这就预告了中国运动员将能登上世界高峰之一的慕士塔格山（拔海七千五百四十六公尺）。
    别列次基说，在攀登慕士塔格山时，尽管碰到的困难很多，但是十二名中国运动员全部登上了慕士塔格山顶峰。以后，又有两名中国运动员登上了公格尔久别山顶峰（拔海七千五百九十五公尺）。
    他说，这些事实表明，中国运动员已经变成了很有希望的爬山运动家。在这次爬山中，中国队员表现出他们有着组织爬山活动的才能和爬山运动员应有的机智、勇敢的品质。因此，他相信中国运动员将能攀登上许多到现在还没有被征服的世界高峰。
    别列次基最后说，像中、苏两国其他传统性的合作一样，两国爬山运动员的合作和友谊将会日益密切。
