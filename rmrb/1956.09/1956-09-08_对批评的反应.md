Reactions to Criticism

    Changsha Railway Station Freight Yard Begins Expansion

    A letter from the Changsha Transportation Business Office states: The opinions expressed by Comrade Fu Qishang and others in the People's Daily on July 25 regarding the expansion of the Changsha Railway Station freight yard are correct. The freight yard area of ​​Changsha Railway Station is too small to meet the needs of business development. In the past, due to the need for the basic construction plan to be approved by the Bureau, we were unable to start construction. Now the Director of the Bureau has approved the expansion plan of the freight yard, and the project has started. In addition, we have separated the shipping and arrival cargo warehouses, which can reduce congestion.

  Coal Washing and Dewatering Work is Being Strengthened

    A letter from the Ministry of Coal Industry states: The opinion in the People's Daily article "This Loss Should Not Be Borne by Users" published on July 18, suggesting that the coal washing plants under the Ministry should strengthen coal washing and dewatering work, is correct. Strengthening dewatering and antifreeze work has been designated as one of the important tasks of the Ministry's coal preparation plants in the second half of the year, and there are currently dedicated personnel on-site to specifically assist in this work.

    However, the statement in the article that "the current average moisture content is as high as 10%, exceeding the planned 5%" is not consistent with the facts. Our Ministry and Anshan Iron and Steel have not stipulated that the moisture content of supplied washed coal should be 5%. Therefore, the calculated waste of railway wagon freight amounting to 850,000 yuan is also incorrect.

      Recalling Poisoned Fruit Juice

    A letter from the Jilin Provincial Food Factory states: The article "Poisoned Fruit Juice" published in the "People's Daily" on August 3rd is a correct criticism of our factory. Due to our sloppy work, raw materials were put into production without inspection and testing after entering the factory, resulting in the production of one thousand and forty-four dozen fruit juice drinks containing [unclear character] acid. After the accident occurred, we immediately took measures, in addition to conducting tests and changing to beverage alcohol, we also telegraphed to various places to recall these unqualified products. We are responsible for exchanging the goods and bear the round-trip expenses. It now appears that not many have been sold. We are determined to accept this lesson, strengthen enterprise management, improve various systems, and ensure the regular production of products that meet quality standards.

    对批评的反应
    长沙车站货场开始扩建
    长沙运输营业所来信说：7月25日人民日报发表傅启商等同志对扩建长沙车站货场的意见，我们认为是正确的。长沙车站的货场面积过小，确实赶不上业务发展的需要，过去由于基本建设计划需由管理局批准，所以我们也无法动工兴建。现在管理局局长已批准了货场的扩建计划，工程已经开工。此外，我们已把发运和到达的货物仓库分开，可以减少拥挤现象。
  洗煤脱水工作正在加强
    煤炭工业部来信说：7月18日人民日报发表“这项损失不应该由用户负担”一文，提出我部所属洗煤厂应加强洗煤脱水工作的意见是正确的。加强脱水和防冻工作已订为我部选煤厂下半年重要工作之一，目前已有专人在现场具体协助这方面的工作。
    但是，文中所说“目前平均水分高达10％，超过计划5％”，与事实不符。我部同鞍钢并未规定供给洗煤水分为5％，因此，所计算的浪费车皮损失运费为八十五万元也是不对的。
      追回含毒的果子露
    吉林省食品厂来信说：8月3日“人民日报”发表的“含毒的果子露”一文，对我厂的批评是正确的。由于我们工作马虎，原料进厂后没有检查化验就投入生产，以致生产出了一千零四十四打含有?酸的果汁露。事故发生以后，我们立即采取措施，除进行化验和改用饮料酒精以外，还电告各地，追回这种不合格的产品。我们负责换货，并且负担往返费用。现在看来，销出数量不多。我们决心接受这次教训，加强企业管理工作，健全各种制度，保证经常生产出合乎质量标准的产品。
