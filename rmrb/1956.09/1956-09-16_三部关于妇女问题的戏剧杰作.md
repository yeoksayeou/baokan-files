　　In 1879, Ibsen’s “A Doll's House” met with European audiences. The bourgeois audience felt very uncomfortable after watching this domestic drama. The unremarkable daily family life, after being handled by the playwright, became a shocking social problem. Every male audience member couldn't help but ask himself: Am I a Helmer, or at least a fraction close to Helmer in thought? Every female audience member couldn't help but ask herself: If I were Nora, what would I do? Everyone would ask: Did Nora leave her so-called warm family due to emotional impulse, or after careful consideration? Many people didn't approve of her throwing away her children and leaving. Some productions even changed the ending. Nora discovers that after eight years with her husband, she has become nothing more than the mother of three children. She says "goodbye," walks to the door, thinks of her children, can't bear it, and returns to Helmer's arms.

　　The "worldliness and morality" viewpoint of bourgeois audiences and directors only demonstrates how cowardly they are, unable to face life as bravely as the playwright, and raise universal social problems from the most ordinary materials. In the nineteenth century, if a woman was extremely dissatisfied with her husband, she would either, like the novelist George Sand, not be afraid of disgrace and run away, or, like Emma Bovary written by another novelist, her close friend Flaubert, commit suicide by taking poison. But the general practice of women, as Flaubert said to his lover, was: "My poor Bovary, needless to say, at this moment, at the same moment, in twenty French villages, she is suffering and crying."

　　These timid audiences and directors have forgotten the ancient Greek tragedian Euripides, who, two thousand years ago, wrote "Medea" on the subject of women's issues. The heroine is a princess who understands magic, but at the beginning of the tragedy, she has already been reduced to a dispensable woman. She lost her wealth and glory all for the sake of love. She once saved her lover's life, helped him escape from danger, killed his pursuing brother on the way, and never had the possibility of returning home. She came to her husband's country and, in order to seize the throne, used a plan to kill his uncle. She eloped with him to another country, bringing two children, thinking that this time she should live in peace until old age, but her husband changed his mind and wanted to become the king's consort. The king knew that she was a woman who understood magic, so at the beginning of the play, he ordered her to leave the country before sunrise the next day. She is a woman who cannot return to her mother's home and cannot stay in her husband's home. What to do? The most ardent love becomes the most ardent hatred at this time. She couldn't stand this. Her revenge is the most terrible revenge in the world: she designed to kill the king and princess, and personally killed her two own children, leaving the most desolate years to her unfaithful husband. She appeared in the sky holding the corpses of her children, and her husband cursed her and begged her below, at least to leave the corpses for him to kiss, but she still refused: "No! No! Your words are in vain." The couple (can they still be called a couple?) broke off their relationship in this way, and parted ways in a situation of irreconcilable opposition.

　　This is an unbearable tragedy. The playwright, in 431 BC, posed the following question to his Greek audience: Should Medea be so vicious? Since the man is unfaithful and does not treat her like a human being, and does not allow her to take the children away, does not treat her like a mother, and is selfish, wanting to use the children she gave birth to to carry on his family line, but simply does not want her, why shouldn't she personally kill the children (how sadly and reluctantly she cried before killing them). This woman is terrible! But she is also really brave! (To be continued)

    三部关于妇女问题的戏剧杰作
    李健吾
    1879年，易卜生的“娜拉”和欧洲观众见面。资产阶级观众看了这出正剧，很不舒服。平淡无奇的日常家庭生活，经过剧作者的处理，变成了触目惊心的社会问题。每一个男观众不由得要问一下自己：我是不是海尔茂，或者思想上至少有几分之几接近海尔茂？每一个女观众也不由得要问一下自己：假如自己是娜拉，又怎么办？人人会问：娜拉丢下世俗所谓温暖的家庭出走，是由于感情冲动，还是经过仔细考虑？很有些人不赞成她把小孩子扔了，一走了之。有的演出，就把结尾改掉。娜拉发见自己和丈夫相处八年，不过成了三个孩子的母亲。她说过“再会”，走到门口，想起孩子，心狠不下去了，又回到海尔茂的怀抱。
    资产阶级观众和导演的“世道人心”观点，仅仅说明自己多么懦怯，不能像剧作者那样敢于正视人生，从最平凡的素材提出富有普遍性的社会问题。妇女在十九世纪，假如不满意丈夫到了极点，不像小说家乔治·桑那样不怕丢人，远走高飞，就像另一位小说家、她的挚友福楼拜在小说里面写的爱玛·包法利一样，服毒自杀。但是妇女的一般作法，如同福楼拜对他的情人说的：“我的可怜的包法利，不用说，就在这时候，在同一时候，在二十个法兰西村子难过、哭泣”。
    这些小胆观众和导演，忘了古希腊悲剧家优里彼狄斯，远在两千年前，就写出了关于妇女问题的“美狄亚”。女主人公是一位懂得法术的公主，但是在悲剧开始，她已经沦落成为一个可弃之妇了。她失去荣华富贵，只为了爱情。她从前救下爱人的性命，带他逃出虎口，半路杀死追赶的兄长，再也没有可能转回家乡。她来到丈夫的国家，又为了抢夺王位，用计害死他的叔父。她跟他亡命到另一个国家，带着两个孩子，心想这回应该平安到老了，可是丈夫变了心，要做国王的驸马。国王晓得她是一个懂得法术的女人，所以戏一开始，就命令她在第二天太阳出来以前，离开国境。她是一个母家回不得、夫家去不得的妇人。怎么办呢？最热烈的爱这时变成最热烈的恨。她忍不了这口气。她的报复是世上最可怕的报复：她设计害死国王和公主，又亲手杀死她的两个亲生孩子，把最凄凉的岁月留给负心丈夫。她挟着孩子的尸体在天空出现了，丈夫在底下骂她，求她，至少把尸首留给他亲亲也好，可是她还是拒绝了：“不成！不成！你这话白说啦”。他们夫妇（还能说是夫妇吗？）就这样恩断义绝，在誓不两立的情形之下，分手了。
    这是一出惨不忍睹的大悲剧。剧作家在公元前431年，给他的希腊观众提出了这样一个问题：美狄亚该不该这样狠毒？男子既然负心，不拿她当人看，而且不许她带孩子走，不拿她当母亲看，而且自私自利，要拿她生下的孩子给他传宗接代，单单不要她，她为什么不该亲手把孩子弄死（她在弄死以前，哭得多伤心，多舍不得啊）。这个女人真可怕！可也真有种！（未完）
