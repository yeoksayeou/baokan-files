Comrades,

    I feel honored to be able to convey the warmest congratulations from the Central Committee of the Israeli Communist Party, all its members, and all progressive people to the heroic Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China. Your great achievements in politics, economy, and culture in such a short period of time are deeply admirable. Your achievements are obtained by relying on the people's power. These achievements set an example for the people of Israel and the people of Asia and Africa, showing how a country can liberate itself from the abyss of foreign enslavement and cruel class exploitation for generations in an extremely short period of time, living a free and hopeful life, with a constantly improving standard of living both materially and culturally. Your achievements prove that if the people of all countries want to be happy, they must be liberated from the shackles of imperialism and the rule of landlords and capitalists, establish people's power under the leadership of the working class and its Marxist-Leninist party, and on the basis of uniting all democratic forces in the country. Every achievement you have made in building socialism encourages and strengthens the struggle of the people of all countries to liberate themselves from foreign shackles and to consolidate world peace, filling the hearts of all progressive people with joy.
    The Communist Party of China is an example of creatively applying Marxism-Leninism based on its own specific conditions and the new situation of the balance of world forces. It provides an example of adherence to principles and an example of flexibility. Your party is an example of proletarian internationalism, maintaining firm and unbreakable solidarity with the Soviet Union and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union is the first major detachment of the socialist revolution, from which all communist parties have learned, are learning, and will learn. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union has made tremendous efforts, under difficult domestic and international conditions, to establish a socialist system in the world for the first time, turning the Soviet Union into a powerful country and becoming the decisive factor in defeating German fascism and Japanese militarism. In this way, the Soviet Union has created new conditions in the world, preventing imperialism from interfering in socialist countries. The 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union developed revolutionary theory and practice under contemporary conditions, which is a powerful impetus for the communist movement and the working-class movement.
    Dear comrades, your congress is a great contribution to the cause of peace, freedom, and socialism. It enriches the theory of Marxism-Leninism and the experience of the communist movement. It makes a great contribution to strengthening the unity of all communist parties. It fills everyone who has the honor of participating in this congress with enthusiasm. Therefore, we thank you and your Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong.
    Dear comrades! We come from a new, small country in Asia—Israel. However, despite being a new country, the ruling groups that determine national policy support old colonialist policies; despite being a small country, imperialists often attempt to use it to achieve reactionary "big" conspiracies. Imperialists often use the disputes between Israel and Arab countries to achieve their colonialist goals and exacerbate international tensions. Now, in order to regain control of the Suez Canal, imperialists are again instigating Israel to take adventurous actions against Egypt. The aggressive groups in Israel are preparing to carry out this despicable task and serve the imperialists. But they cannot represent the will of the people.
    The Israeli Communist Party represents the people's desire for peace and the national interests of Israel, and is fighting against the sinister conspiracy to use Israel to launch aggression against Egypt, Syria, and any other Arab country. The national interests of the Israeli people and the Arab peoples are consistent: they are all against imperialism and demand independence and peace. We fully support the just and legitimate action of the Egyptian government in nationalizing the Suez Canal. This action weakens imperialism, thereby benefiting the cause of peace and the cause of independence for the peoples of Middle Eastern countries, including the Israeli people. The nationalization of the Suez Canal marks a new and higher stage in the struggle for national independence, reaching the stage of fighting for economic independence and fighting for complete independence. Israel, like other countries, has the right to free navigation on the Suez Canal. However, the way to realize this right should not be through threats and the use of force, but through negotiations and agreements with Egypt. As long as Israel supports the nationalization of the canal and expresses solidarity with the Egyptian people's struggle against imperialist intervention, the basis for such negotiations and agreements can be formed. Any military adventure by Israel against Egypt is tantamount to suicide. We Israeli communists, as patriots and internationalists, will do everything in our power to establish an anti-imperialist peace front in Israel to prevent this dangerous development and to ensure that the armistice agreements between Israel and Arab countries are strictly enforced.
    The Israeli Communist Party is working to fundamentally change Israel's policy, from a policy of dependence on the United States to a policy of national independence and peace. The policy of dependence on the United States and the arms race does no good to our people, it only brings poverty, unemployment, soaring prices, and heavy taxes. To ensure Israel's security, we cannot rely on imperialism and the arms race, we cannot rely on demonstrations against Arab countries, but on an independent and peaceful policy, on standing on the same front with Arab countries against imperialism and fighting for independence, on recognizing the national rights of Palestinian Arabs, and we cannot ignore the suffering of Arab refugees and their right to return to their homeland. In this way, conditions can be created so that Israel can enjoy prosperity and security, its people's living standards can be improved day by day, and its international status can be strengthened.
    The Israeli Communist Party is working to abolish Israel's military rule within the Arab regions, a rule of national oppression. It is working to ensure that Israel's Arab residents have freedom of movement and equal national rights.
    Comrades! Our struggle is not being carried out under easy conditions, but we know that the cause of peace and independence in the Middle East, like the cause of peace and independence in other parts of the world, will surely achieve final victory. The active peace policy of the Soviet Union and the entire socialist camp, coupled with the struggle of the people of all countries against war, has repeatedly saved the situation and prevented the outbreak of war between Israel and Arab countries this year. The imperialists are interested in this war in order to find an excuse for military intervention. We are striving for a peaceful solution to the Palestine problem, a solution that takes into account the national interests of all peoples concerned. We advocate maintaining unity with the peoples of Asian and African countries in the spirit of the Bandung Conference, advocating friendship with the Soviet Union, People's China, and people's democratic countries, advocating Israel's support for China's restoration of its legitimate rights in the United Nations, and advocating the establishment of diplomatic relations between Israel and People's China. Our people are now increasingly aware of the need to change Israel's current policy and adopt a policy of peace, independence, and neutrality. We are fighting for the united action of the working class, for the establishment of a people's anti-imperialist front, so that Israel can implement a policy that represents the national interests of our people, as well as the interests of peace and independence.
    Dear comrades, please allow me to once again extend my heartfelt congratulations to your historic achievements, and wish you new and greater achievements in building socialism in China, in strengthening the anti-imperialist unity of Asian and African countries, and in consolidating world peace.
    Long live the heroic Communist Party of China, the compass and conscience of the great Chinese people!
    The guarantee of the victory of the cause of peace, national independence, democracy, and socialism—long live proletarian internationalism!
    Long live Marxism-Leninism, which guides the people of all countries to the path of complete national and social liberation!

### 以色列共产党代表团团长维尔纳同志致词

专栏：

    以色列共产党代表团团长维尔纳同志致词亲爱的同志们：
    我感到荣幸，能够向英勇的中国共产党的第八次代表大会转达以色列共产党中央委员会和全体党员以及全体进步人民的最热烈的祝贺。你们在这么短的时间里面，在政治、经济、文化方面取得了伟大的成就，使人深感敬佩。你们的成就是依靠人民的政权获得的。这些成就向以色列人民和亚非各国人民树立了一个榜样，说明一个国家怎么样能够在极短的时间内，把自己从世世代代受外国的奴役和残酷的阶级剥削的深渊里解放出来，过着自由的、充满希望的生活，不论在物质上或文化上，生活水平都在不断提高。你们的成就证明了，各国人民要得到幸福，就必须从帝国主义的束缚和地主、资本家的统治下解放出来，在工人阶级及其马克思列宁主义政党的领导下，在团结全国一切民主力量的基础上，建立起人民政权。你们在建设社会主义方面所获得的每一个成就，都在鼓舞和加强各国人民争取从外国枷锁下得到解放，争取巩固世界和平的斗争，使得所有进步的人民心里充满了喜悦。
    中国共产党是根据本国特有的条件和世界力量对比的新形势，创造性地运用马克思列宁主义的范例。它提供了坚持原则的范例和灵活性的范例。你们的党是无产阶级国际主义的范例，它同苏联和苏联共产党保持着坚定的牢不可破的团结。苏联共产党是社会主义革命的第一个主要的突击队，所有共产主义政党在过去、现在和将来都向它学习。苏联共产党作了巨大的努力，在困难的国内和国际条件下，在世界上首先建立了社会主义制度，把苏联变成一个强大的国家，成为战胜德国法西斯主义和日本军国主义的决定性的因素。这样，苏联就使世界上能够形成新的条件，使帝国主义不能干涉社会主义国家。苏联共产党的第二十次代表大会在当代的条件下发展了革命的理论和实践，这对于共产主义运动和工人阶级运动是一个强大的推动力量。
    亲爱的同志们，你们的代表大会对于和平、自由和社会主义的事业是一个伟大的贡献。它丰富了马克思列宁主义的理论和共产主义运动的经验。它对于加强所有共产主义政党的团结有很大的贡献。它使荣幸地参加这次大会的每一个人都满怀热情。因此，我们感谢你们和你们的以毛泽东同志为首的中央委员会。
    亲爱的同志们！我们来自亚洲的一个新的小国家——以色列。但是，尽管是一个新国家，而决定国家政策的统治集团却支持老的殖民主义政策；尽管是一个小国家，而帝国主义者却经常企图利用它来实现反动的“大”阴谋。帝国主义者经常利用以色列和阿拉伯国家间的争端，来达到他们的殖民主义的目的，加剧国际紧张局势。现在，帝国主义者为了重新控制苏伊士运河，又在唆使以色列采取反对埃及的冒险行动。以色列的侵略集团正在准备执行这一卑鄙的任务，为帝国主义者效劳。但是他们并不能代表人民的意志。
    以色列共产党代表人民的和平愿望，代表以色列的民族利益，正在进行斗争，反对利用以色列向埃及、叙利亚和任何其他阿拉伯国家进行侵略的罪恶阴谋。以色列人民和阿拉伯各族人民的民族利益是一致的：他们都反对帝国主义，要求独立，要求和平。我们完全支持埃及政府将苏伊士运河收归国有这一正义的和合法的行动。这一行动削弱了帝国主义，从而有利于和平事业和中东国家各族人民，包括以色列人民在内，争取独立的事业。苏伊士运河的国有化标志着争取民族独立的斗争达到了新的、更高的阶段，达到了争取经济独立和争取完全独立的阶段。以色列也像其他国家一样，有权在苏伊士运河自由通航。然而，实现这项权利的办法，不应当是威胁和使用武力，而应当是同埃及谈判和取得协议。只要以色列支持运河国有化，并且表示声援埃及人民反抗帝国主义干涉的斗争，这种谈判和协议的基础就能够形成。以色列对埃及进行任何军事冒险，都无异于自杀。我们以色列共产党人作为爱国者和国际主义者，将尽我们所能在以色列建立反帝国主义的和平战线，来防止这种危险的发展，和保证以色列和阿拉伯国家之间的停战协定得到严格执行。
    以色列共产党正在努力争取根本改变以色列的政策，从依附美国的政策转变为民族独立和和平的政策。依附美国和军备竞赛的政策对我国人民一无好处，它带来的只有贫困、失业、物价飞涨和沉重的赋税。要保证以色列的安全，不能依靠帝国主义和军备竞赛，不能依靠对阿拉伯国家示威，而要依靠独立、和平的政策，要同阿拉伯国家站在一条战线上反对帝国主义，争取独立，要承认巴勒斯坦阿拉伯人的民族权利，不能漠然不顾阿拉伯难民的痛苦和他们返回祖国的权利。这样，才能造成一种条件，使以色列能够享受繁荣和安全，使它的人民的生活水平日益提高，它的国际地位得以加强。
    以色列共产党正在努力争取废除以色列在阿拉伯地区内的军事统治，民族压迫的统治。它正在努力争取保证以色列的阿拉伯居民有来往的自由和平等的民族权利。
    同志们！我们的斗争不是在轻易的条件下进行的，但是我们知道中东的和平和独立的事业，正像世界上其他地方的和平和独立的事业一样，一定会得到最后的胜利。苏联和整个社会主义阵营的积极的和平政策，加上各国人民反对战争的斗争，在今年已经多次挽救了危局，防止了以色列和阿拉伯国家之间爆发战争。而帝国主义者为了寻找进行军事干涉的借口，对于这战争是感兴趣的。我们在争取和平解决巴勒斯坦问题，这问题的解决要考虑到有关各族人民的民族利益。我们主张同亚非国家人民本着万隆会议的精神保持团结，主张同苏联、人民中国和人民民主国家保持友好，主张以色列支持中国恢复在联合国的合法权利，主张以色列和人民中国建立外交关系。我国人民，现在已经越来越认识到有必要改变以色列目前的政策，而采取和平、独立和中立的政策。我们正在为工人阶级的一致行动、为建立人民反帝国主义阵线而奋斗，使得以色列能够实行一种代表我国人民的民族利益，以及和平和独立的利益的政策。
    亲爱的同志们，请允许我再一次向你们的具有历史意义的成就致衷心的祝贺，并且祝你们在中国建设社会主义方面，在加强亚非国家反帝国主义团结方面，在巩固世界和平方面，获得新的更大的成就。
    伟大的中国人民的指南针和良心——英勇的中国共产党万岁！
    和平、民族独立、民主和社会主义的事业的胜利的保证——无产阶级国际主义万岁！
    引导各国人民走向完全的民族解放和社会解放的道路的马克思列宁主义万岁！（附图片）
