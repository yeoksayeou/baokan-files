Dear Comrades!

On behalf of all party members, the Central Committee of the Malayan Communist Party extends its highest respect and heartfelt congratulations to the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China.

The convening of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China is not only a great happy event for the 600 million Chinese people, but also a great happy event for all peace-loving people in the world.

Today, people all over the world, especially the oppressed peoples of Asia and Africa, are constantly watching all the achievements made by the great Chinese people under the leadership of the Communist Party. In their struggle against colonialism for national independence, they have drawn useful lessons from the extremely rich experience of the Chinese revolution, thereby encouraging the people of all countries to move forward more firmly along their own path.

Our motherland, Malaya, has not yet gained independence. Striving for the complete independence of the motherland is the consistent goal of the Malayan people and the Malayan Communist Party. Precisely because of this, the colonialists launched a colonial war lasting more than eight years aimed at suppressing the national independence movement.

This colonial war has brought endless disasters to the people of all ethnic groups in Malaya. Our party has put forward reasonable proposals for restoring peace in our country and has made unremitting efforts. It is very regrettable that the Malayan authorities have not yet seen through the colonialists' conspiracy of "using Malayans to fight Malayans" and attempted to coerce us to surrender unconditionally by military force. We have pointed out more than once that this policy, which violates the will of the people, can never be realized. The erroneous policy of the Malayan authorities has deepened the suffering of the people of all ethnic groups who have suffered from the colonial war for more than eight years, and has caused the great unity of the people of all ethnic groups to be unable to be realized at an early date, and the cause of Malayan independence has therefore suffered great damage.

The people of all ethnic groups in our country are now continuing to wage an indomitable struggle to restore domestic peace. They earnestly hope that the people of all countries will give sympathy and support to the restoration of peace in our country. They also welcome various international well-intentioned mediations that are beneficial to the restoration of peace in our country. If peace can be restored in Malaya, it will not only be a blessing for the people of all ethnic groups in our country, but also a major contribution to peace in Asia and the world.

Our country is a country with complex ethnic groups. Provoking the good relations between people of all ethnic groups has always been the main means for colonialists to implement their divide-and-rule policy. Therefore, the sincere unity of the people of all ethnic groups in our country is the decisive factor in carrying out the anti-colonialist struggle and realizing the national independence of our country. If the unity between the people of all ethnic groups in our country can be consolidated, and a broad united front of anti-colonialism of all nationalities, all classes, all parties, all regions, and all patriots can be quickly established, the cause of independence, democracy, and peace in our country will inevitably be victorious.

Dear Comrades, please allow us, through the Eighth National Congress of your Party, to express the respect of the people of all ethnic groups in Malaya to the great Chinese people who are diligently and bravely building socialism.

Long live the great Chinese people!

Long live the great People's Republic of China!

Long live the glorious Communist Party of China!
              Central Committee of the Malayan Communist Party
                  Chairman: Musa bin Ahmad
                  General Secretary: Chen Ping

### 马来亚共产党中央委员会的贺信

    马来亚共产党中央委员会的贺信亲爱的同志们！
    马来亚共产党中央委员会代表全体党员，向中国共产党第八次全国代表大会致崇高的敬意和衷心的祝贺。
    中国共产党第八次全国代表大会的召开，不但对于六亿中国人民是一桩大喜事，而且对于全世界爱好和平的人民也是一桩大喜事。
    今天，全世界人民，特别是亚洲和非洲被压迫各民族人民，时刻都在注视着在共产党领导下的伟大中国人民所不断取得的一切成就。他们在为反对殖民主义争取民族独立的斗争中，从极其丰富的中国革命经验中吸取了有益的教训，从而鼓舞了各国人民更坚定地沿着自己的道路前进。
    我们的祖国——马来亚，目前还没有获得独立。争取祖国的完全独立，这是马来亚人民和马来亚共产党始终不渝的奋斗目标。正因为如此，殖民主义者发动了久达八年以上的旨在镇压民族独立运动的殖民战争。
    这个殖民战争给马来亚各族人民带来了无限祸害。我们的党曾经为了恢复我国的和平提出了合理的主张，并且做出了不懈的努力。非常遗憾的是，马来亚当局还未识破殖民主义者的“以马来亚人打马来亚人”的阴谋，企图用军事力量来要挟我方无条件投降。我方已经不止一次指出，这种违反人民意愿的政策是永远不能实现的。马来亚当局这种错误的政策，使遭受了八年多的殖民战争的各族人民的痛苦日益加深，造成了各民族人民的大团结不能早日实现，马来亚独立事业因而也就遭受极大的损害。
    我国各族人民现在继续在为恢复国内和平而进行不挠的斗争。他们热切地希望各国人民在为恢复我国和平方面给予同情和支持。他们也欢迎国际各种有益于恢复我国和平的善意的调停。如果马来亚和平得以恢复，不但是我国各族人民的幸事，而且对亚洲和世界和平也是一个重大的贡献。
    我国是一个民族复杂的国家，挑拨各族人民之间的良好关系从来是殖民主义者执行其分而治之政策的主要手段。因而，我国各民族人民的真诚团结是进行反殖民主义斗争，实现我国民族独立的决定因素。如果我国各族人民之间的团结得以巩固，全国各民族、各阶层、各政党、各地域以及所有爱国人士的反殖民主义的广泛的统一战线能够迅速建立起来，我国独立、民主、和平的事业也就必然能够得到胜利。
    亲爱的同志们，请允许我们通过你们党的第八次全国代表大会，向正在勤劳勇敢建设社会主义的伟大中国人民表达马来亚各族人民的敬意。
    伟大的中国人民万岁！
    伟大的中华人民共和国万岁！
    光荣的中国共产党万岁！
              马来亚共产党中央委员会
                  主席：穆沙·宾·阿默德
                  总书记：陈平
