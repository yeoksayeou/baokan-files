    Driven by the increasing superiority of agricultural cooperativization demonstrated over the years and the achievements of socialist industrialization, and especially encouraged by the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong's report on agricultural cooperativization, the enthusiasm of the majority of the masses to take the socialist road has rapidly increased. After we corrected the right-leaning conservative ideas of some comrades, a high tide of agricultural cooperativization unfolded in the rural areas of the country on an unprecedentedly broad scale and to an extremely profound degree. The development of the movement has been rapid and healthy. By the spring of this year, most areas of our country had basically achieved agricultural cooperativization. The high tide of agricultural cooperativization has triggered a high tide of agricultural production. The Party Central Committee promptly put forward the "National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) for Twelve Years," pointing out long-term goals for agricultural development, further enhancing the enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers for cooperativization and production, and undertaking unprecedentedly huge work in areas such as farmland water conservancy, fertilizer accumulation and production, improved cultivation techniques, changes in cropping systems, promotion of advanced experiences, and afforestation. This year's wheat and early rice have both increased in production. Although the autumn crops in many provinces have suffered severe disasters, this year's total grain output is still likely to reach the level originally planned for 1957 in the First Five-Year Plan. The disaster area this year is roughly the same as in 1954, but the grain output has still increased compared to the bumper year of 1955, which further proves the superiority of the socialist cooperative economy. The great victory of such historical significance achieved in agricultural cooperativization undoubtedly contributes to accelerating the realization of socialist industrialization and agricultural modernization in our country.

    After the realization of agricultural cooperativization and the fundamental changes in rural production relations, a series of new problems and new contradictions have emerged under the new production relations. At the same time, due to insufficient experience and certain impatient sentiments once generated by some comrades in the face of the revolutionary high tide, some shortcomings have been brought about in certain tasks. These problems and shortcomings are generated in the new situation and the rapid advancement of the movement, and some are unavoidable or difficult to completely avoid. We should affirm achievements, overcome shortcomings, consolidate victories, continue to move forward, and strive to basically achieve the advanced cooperativization of the country in 1957 in a prepared and planned manner (excluding some border areas); at the same time, we must continue to consolidate and improve existing cooperatives, mobilize all positive factors, and comprehensively develop agricultural production. To this end, Party committees and people's committees at all levels must, based on the specific conditions of their respective regions, take effective measures to strive to solve the following problems:

    (1) Guarantee the need for grain and cotton, increase the production of other cash crops, develop animal husbandry, and develop diversified operations to comprehensively develop production.

    Grain production is the foundation for the development of the agricultural economy. Cotton is the first important cash crop. Increasing the production of grain and cotton is of utmost importance for ensuring the needs of the people's livelihood and the development of the national economy. Therefore, the policy of focusing on increasing grain and cotton production in agricultural production must continue to be implemented and cannot be shaken in the slightest. It was entirely correct for various localities to focus on increasing grain and cotton production in recent years.

    However, while ensuring the increase in grain and cotton production, it is also necessary to pay attention to increasing the production of other cash crops, developing animal husbandry, forestry, fishery, and other various sideline productions, developing diversified operations, and comprehensively developing agricultural and sideline productions. Various cash crops, animal husbandry, and various sideline productions account for a large proportion of rural income, even accounting for 40 to 50 percent or more of the total agricultural output value in many provinces. If diversified operations are neglected, it will inevitably affect the increase in the income of cooperatives and individual members, and will also affect the balanced development of the national economy and the needs of people's lives. At the same time, agriculture, forestry, fishery, animal husbandry, and various sideline industries, transportation industries, and handicraft industries are all inseparable parts of the rural economy. Various productions have a mutually supportive role. Only by implementing diversified operations can we more effectively promote the increase in grain and cotton production, rationally utilize land, better allocate labor time throughout the year, and fully improve labor utilization and labor productivity. Therefore, the backward state of certain cash crops, animal husbandry, and sideline productions caused by various reasons in recent years must be quickly changed. To this end:

    First, cooperatives should be helped to formulate a comprehensive production plan based on the specific conditions of the cooperative, the needs (including the state, the cooperative, and the members), and the possibilities, focusing on grain and cotton (generally focusing on grain in general areas and focusing on cotton in concentrated cotton-producing areas), and make comprehensive arrangements for arable land, labor, livestock power, funds, and technology. When formulating plans, for the cash crops that farmers are accustomed to planting and the various sideline productions that they are accustomed to operating, do not blindly change planting or stop operating. Those that have stopped operating should be quickly restored, and those that can be developed should be vigorously developed.

    In industrial and mining areas and urban suburbs, the production of vegetables, fruits, and the breeding of livestock and poultry should be developed to meet the needs of cities.

    Second, livestock power will still be the main power for agricultural production for a considerable period of time. We must earnestly help cooperatives establish and improve the management and use system of draft animals, and generally adopt the method of special personnel being responsible for decentralized feeding. Cooperatives should comprehensively solve the feed problem, and the state should also reserve sufficient feed according to the "three fixes" method in the unified purchase of grain. Overuse should be prevented, and special attention should be paid to protecting breeding animals, female animals, pregnant animals, and young animals. Do a good job in livestock breeding, pregnancy protection, and disease prevention. Some agricultural production cooperatives one-sidedly emphasize reducing production costs, excessively increase the labor intensity of draft animals, and sell or slaughter draft animals that are not really surplus. If this phenomenon is not quickly stopped, it will cause great difficulties for future production. In order to adjust draft animals, the state commercial departments should be responsible for solving the problem of livestock exchange.

    In pastoral areas, livestock and livestock products should be developed in a planned manner. In order to promote the smooth development of animal husbandry, agricultural production should also be appropriately developed under possible conditions to solve the problem of food for the people and feed for livestock.

    Developing pig raising is extremely important for solving fertilizer, increasing the income of cooperatives and members, meeting the needs of people's meat supply and exports. All localities are required to earnestly implement the instructions issued by the State Council on July 1 this year.

    Third, in mountainous areas, a comprehensive mountainous production plan combining agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and other sideline industries should generally be formulated, and different production priorities for different mountainous areas should be specified according to different specific conditions such as suitability for forestry, agriculture, and animal husbandry. When reclaiming barren mountains, we must strictly pay attention to soil and water conservation in accordance with the soil and water conservation regulations, and no deforestation is allowed for land.

    Fourth, agricultural production cooperatives should actively develop sideline production. In addition to those that must be collectively operated, which can be uniformly operated by the cooperative, everything that is conducive to decentralized operation should be encouraged and assisted as much as possible for members' families to operate independently or encourage cooperative-owned private operation, so as to achieve reasonable division of labor and benefit production. In the first few years of initial operation, cooperatives should concentrate their efforts on running agriculture, animal husbandry, and major sideline productions well. Other large numbers of sideline industries that are conducive to decentralized operation should be managed by members. The tendencies of indiscriminately concentrating all sideline production in the cooperative or unduly restricting members from engaging in sideline production must be corrected. Of course, the tendency of only caring about members' family sideline production and hindering the cooperative's collective production should also be prevented.

    (2) Under the guidance of the national plan, maintain the independence of cooperative production and operation.

    Planned production is one of the basic characteristics of the socialist economy. The development of our country's national economy is planned. The production of cooperatives must also be planned and must be carried out under the guidance of the national economic plan. This should be affirmed. On the one hand, at the beginning of this year, some places and some cooperatives once set the grain production plan too high, deviating from reality, and instead lost the guiding role of the plan. This bias has generally been corrected. On the other hand, the allocation plan for the planting area of various crops was set too rigidly from above, often not in line with the actual situation, and mechanically required the lower levels to implement it, which resulted in the lower levels being forced to command. This problem must be corrected.

    Agricultural production is different from industrial production. A large part of agricultural production is self-sufficient production, and it is greatly affected by natural conditions and has great regional characteristics. Agricultural cooperatives are not state-owned enterprises, but collectively-owned or partially collectively-owned. Therefore, agricultural production plans must never be treated in the same way as industrial production plans. The formulation of agricultural production plans must adopt a method combining top-down and bottom-up, and must be managed by the central government and local governments at different levels. The central government should gradually transition from stipulating production plans to stipulating procurement plans and allocation plans for agricultural products. The central government's agricultural production and procurement plans only stipulate to the province level, and the province can specifically arrange its own plans based on the central plan and the situation in its own region. The production plan targets set by the central government and higher levels can be appropriately adjusted by local and lower levels. In terms of planning methods, different methods can be adopted for different crops. For grain, the state can only stipulate the total grain output target and the purchase targets and allocation targets by variety. For cash crops and livestock products with greater commercial characteristics, the state can stipulate more detailed itemized procurement targets. For scattered small miscellaneous grains, agricultural and sideline products, and local specialties that are not easy to include in the national plan, some can be included in the provincial and county plans, and some can be directly contracted with cooperatives by procurement departments and commercial departments, using contracts and price policies to promote cooperatives to carry out production in a planned manner.

    On the premise of completing the state's agricultural tax and unified procurement tasks for agricultural products, and fulfilling the contractual obligations signed with other economic departments, agricultural production cooperatives can freely formulate the production plan for the entire cooperative according to their own needs and possibilities. The plans proposed by the central and local governments have a reference and guiding role for agricultural production cooperatives, but cannot directly order cooperatives to handle everything according to the plans from above. Only in this way can we truly maintain the independence of agricultural production cooperatives in production and operation under the guidance of the national economic plan, thereby improving the production enthusiasm of cooperatives.

    (3) Actively, steadily, and in accordance with local conditions, implement technological reforms and promote advanced experiences.

    In the specific situation that our country has not yet realized agricultural mechanization and it is impossible to reclaim wasteland on a large scale (localities should strive to reclaim small amounts of wasteland as much as possible based on the possibility to expand the cultivated land area), our current main way to develop agricultural production is to gradually carry out technological reforms (including water conservancy construction, land leveling, and soil improvement and other farmland basic construction, and improvement of farm tools, promotion of improved varieties, accumulation of fertilizer production, prevention and control of pests and diseases, improvement of cultivation techniques, changes in cropping systems, etc.) based on cooperation to increase the yield per unit area.

    In the past few years, especially since last winter, all localities have seized the favorable conditions created by cooperation, adopted an active policy, carried out technological reforms, and promoted advanced experiences, such as building small water conservancy projects, turning dry land into paddy fields, changing single seasons into double seasons, changing sparse sowing into dense planting, and promoting new farm tools, selecting improved varieties, and developing fertilizer sources. The amount of work is unprecedented, and the achievements are also enormous. However, due to the fact that some plans were too large in the promotion process, technical guidance was insufficient, some steps were too hasty, and some did not take into account the regional characteristics of agricultural production and were generalized in promotion, forced orders occurred in some places, causing losses and deviating from the masses. The current task is to summarize the successful experiences of various localities, actively promote them, and analyze the reasons for local failures and correct them.

    The Central Committee believes that the policy of promoting technological reforms and promoting advanced production-increasing experiences must be active and cannot be conservative. However, the practice must be adapted to local conditions, and the steps must be steady and prudent, and cannot be rash. We must actively absorb all foreign advanced experiences, including the successful experiences of foreign countries and other places, and must strictly pay attention to the adaptability of the region and must be promoted after successful local trials. Those that are relatively certain can be carried out in two steps: the first step is to focus on trials, and the second step is to promote on a large scale; those with less certainty should be carried out in three steps: the first step is to focus on trials, the second step is to carry out multi-point trials, and the third step is to promote on a large scale. When promoting these tasks, we must also adhere to the principle of voluntary participation of the masses. If agricultural cooperative cadres and the masses are unwilling to adopt them, even if they can indeed increase production, they can only be persuaded through demonstrations and cannot be forced to promote them. Of course, it is also wrong to adopt a laissez-faire attitude towards technological reforms. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the demonstration role of state-owned farms, strengthen the work of agricultural technology guidance stations, and strengthen agricultural scientific research work, so that science and technology and the practical experience of farmers can be correctly combined. Not only should foreign advanced experiences be introduced to the masses, but also the advanced agricultural science should be used to summarize the production-increasing experiences of the farmers, especially the old farmers and experienced gardeners, and promote them in areas with the same conditions. Only by implementing technological reforms and promoting advanced experiences according to these principles can we avoid mistakes and achieve the goal of increasing production.

    (4) Strengthen labor management and improve labor productivity.

    Improving labor productivity is the most important condition for improving cooperative production and the fundamental source of ensuring increased income for members. Rationally organizing the collective labor of members is a central link in improving labor productivity. In this regard, various localities have created some successful experiences. However, due to insufficient experience and lack of attention to labor planning, there are still some shortcomings in labor management, and the phenomena of low labor efficiency and waste of labor still exist in many places. In order to gradually improve labor productivity, the following aspects should be emphasized in labor management at present:

    First, we must always pay attention to continuously maintaining the balance of the labor plan according to the needs of production. When formulating and revising the labor plan, we must not only ensure the general balance throughout the year, but also ensure the balance in each production season. We must ensure that there is enough labor in the busy farming season and that there is a way out for the remaining labor in the slack farming season. We must ensure that the labor needs of agriculture and sideline industries, current production and basic construction are properly arranged. We must also pay attention to the balance of labor between various production teams and production groups to avoid uneven idleness and busyness. We must also pay attention to the rational matching and use of male labor and female labor, and full labor and half labor, so as to give full play to labor enthusiasm.

    Second, rationally adjust the labor organization. The production teams and production groups in some places are now too large and should be adjusted according to the current production technology conditions and the needs of field operations. According to the experience of various localities, under the current conditions, small teams (averaging 20 to 40 households) and small groups (averaging 7 to 8 households) are generally more suitable.

    Third, strengthen quota management. This is a very meticulous and specific task, and we should not be satisfied with the general quota provisions. Agricultural quotas are different from industrial quotas. They have great regional characteristics and are often affected by changes in natural conditions. Therefore, the quota standards set by provinces and counties can only be used as a reference for each cooperative, and it is not possible or necessary to emphasize uniformity. The quota standards set by each cooperative should also be adjusted according to the changes in the situation when necessary, and the production team should have the right to make necessary flexible adjustments on the premise that the total number of work points for contracting work remains basically unchanged. We must also pay attention to summarizing experiences in a timely manner, adopt some transitional steps to promote quotas, and gradually improve quota management.

    Fourth, improving labor productivity should be achieved by rationally improving labor organization, rationally using labor, strengthening labor protection, improving tools as much as possible, and improving and improving production technology. Any incorrect practices contrary to this, such as inappropriately extending working hours, increasing labor intensity, or forcing work assignments regardless of the physical fitness of members, are not allowed. Special attention should be paid to labor protection for female members, especially pregnant women.

    Fifth, on the premise of obeying the needs of collective labor, we must appropriately take care of the time for members to operate family sideline industries and handle housework. In this regard, many cooperatives have the shortcoming of being too restrictive. In the future, according to the cooperative charter, members should have the right to freely dispose of their labor in the time outside the working days stipulated in the cooperative.

    (5) Do a good job in the distribution of cooperatives.

    The distribution problem is one of the keys to consolidating cooperatives and an important aspect of socialist production relations. The superiority of the socialist economy must also be combined with the personal interests of members through distribution in order to be recognized by the broad masses of members. It must be understood that production is the basis of distribution, but if the distribution is improper, it will inevitably affect the development of production in turn.

    Collective interest is the basis of personal interest, but if collective interest is overemphasized and personal interest cannot be properly taken care of, the result will inevitably harm collective interest. Therefore, production and distribution, national interest, collective interest, and personal interest must be correctly combined. The central government proposes to distribute 60% to 70% of the cooperative's income to members and strive to increase the income of 90% of the members, which is a specific guarantee for realizing this correct combination. However, due to the fact that most cooperatives are newly established and have a weak foundation, coupled with the fact that some cooperatives spent extravagantly, had excessive capital construction expenditures, and reduced sideline income this spring, it is still a very difficult task to achieve an increase in income for 90% of the members. To this end, we must make special efforts to complete the agricultural and sideline production increase plan in the second half of this year, and on this basis, do a good job in the distribution of cooperatives.

    First, we must adhere to the principle of running cooperatives diligently and thriftily. Production costs should be saved as much as possible on the premise of ensuring increased production. Non-production costs should be avoided or reduced as much as possible. In order to facilitate members to exercise financial supervision, the internal accounts of the cooperative should be made public on a monthly or quarterly basis, economic democracy should be earnestly implemented, and extravagance and waste and any corruption phenomena must be resolutely opposed.

    Second, in addition to ensuring the completion of the state's agricultural tax and leaving the necessary production costs, the cooperative's public accumulation fund and public welfare fund should generally not exceed 5% of the total income this year. The regular tax of the agricultural tax has been determined to maintain the level of last year and will not be increased, and the local surcharge cannot be increased too much. We must ensure that 60% to 70% of the cooperative's income can truly be distributed to members, and in areas with normal harvests, we must strive to achieve an increase in income for 90% of the members.

    The financial work of most cooperatives in various localities is relatively weak, and Party and government at all levels must vigorously strengthen leadership in this area.

    Third, in distribution, we must adhere to the principle of distribution according to labor, more work more pay, and equal pay for equal work for men and women. The principles of distribution according to class composition, who is poor gets more, or distribution according to population are wrong. For members with less labor or particularly weak labor and members who have encountered unfortunate accidents, appropriate care should be given from the aspects of production arrangement and from the public welfare fund.

    When distributing grain, members with strong labor, more work, and therefore higher grain ration needs should be given appropriate care.

    Fourth, a regular advance payment system for labor remuneration should be established, and we should first strive to make monthly advance payments or loans during the lean season. This is of great significance for solving the difficulties in the daily life of poor members and improving the labor enthusiasm of members. The sources of advance payments are mainly the cooperative's sideline income and advance purchase payments for agricultural products.

    Fifth, cooperatives should earnestly take care of the five-guarantee households according to the current production level. In addition to appropriately arranging them to participate in production under possible conditions, their living difficulties should be solved by the public welfare fund and part of the land remuneration combined with the state's relief grain and funds, so that it is not lower than the level before joining the cooperative.

    (6) Implement the policy of mutual benefit.

    Adhering to the policy of mutual benefit is one of the basic conditions for the smooth success of agricultural cooperativization in our country. The policy of mutual benefit is not only important during the establishment of cooperatives, but also equally important for the long-term consolidation of cooperatives. Not only should the principle of mutual benefit be followed when dealing with the means of production of poor and middle peasants joining the cooperative, but the principle of mutual benefit should not be deviated from when dealing with various issues of economic relations between members. Therefore, we must continue to implement the policy of mutual benefit, and first appropriately solve the following problems:

    First, in many places, the price of trees joining the cooperative is too low, and even some mature forests and young forests are not priced. In some places, scattered trees that should not have joined the cooperative were also forced to join the cooperative. In order to facilitate the protection of trees, the development of forestry production, and the strengthening of internal unity within the cooperative, it must be handled according to the opinions of the masses and in accordance with the provisions of the agricultural cooperative charter. Those that have not been priced should be seriously priced, and those that have been priced too low should be appropriately adjusted. This is not only conducive to unity within the cooperative, but also conducive to production and conducive to increasing the income of 90% of the members. We should not be afraid of trouble in this regard. However, for those that were originally handled basically reasonably and members generally have no opinions, do not re-litigate.

    Second, the prices of draft animals, farm tools, and sideline tools joining the cooperative in some places that have not been priced or priced too low should also be handled in accordance with the above spirit. For some sideline equipment that is relatively large and valuable, if it is difficult to pay off the price within three to five years after joining the cooperative, the repayment period can be appropriately extended with the consent of the members.

    Third, in order to gain the trust of the members, the principal of the members' investment and the price of the members' draft animals and farm tools exceeding the shares should be repaid, the interest that should be paid must be paid, and the forest remuneration that the members should receive must also be paid.

    Fourth, when encouraging members to invest in the cooperative, we must abide by the principle of voluntariness. Any forced apportionment or deduction is prohibited. In addition, the credit cooperative can absorb members' deposits to supplement the lack of funds in the agricultural cooperative in addition to solving the difficulties in production and life of the members, but the credit cooperative must adhere to the principles of voluntary deposits, free withdrawals, and keeping the depositor's secrets, and shall not force deposits. The erroneous practice of agricultural cooperatives freezing members' deposits in credit cooperatives must also be prohibited.

    All fertilizers invested by cooperative members in the cooperative must be reasonably priced to encourage members to accumulate fertilizer.

    Fifth, the private plots in some places are too small, and even none are left. In order to meet the needs of members' family breeding industry and daily life, members should be allowed to keep enough in accordance with the cooperative charter. However, it should not be left too much either.

    (7) Strengthen the organizational construction of cooperatives.

    The organizational construction of cooperatives must fully reflect the principles of the socialist economic system, and must also take care of the current specific conditions, so that the organizational form of the cooperative is adapted to the current management level, technical level, and production content.

    First, the size of the cooperative is a major issue in the organizational construction of the cooperative. The size of the existing cooperatives is mostly reasonable, but in some places there was once a tendency to unilaterally seek large size, which increased some difficulties in management and internal unity within the cooperative. The Central Committee believes that the size of the cooperative should be stipulated according to the principles of being conducive to production, being conducive to unity, being suitable for the current management level, and being easy to contact members. Under the current conditions, the size of the cooperative is appropriate in mountainous areas with about 100 households, in hilly areas with about 200 households, and in plain areas with about 300 households. Large villages with more than 300 households can also have one cooperative per village. In the future, when establishing and merging cooperatives, it should be carried out according to this scale. As for the existing large cooperatives, those that can be run well should strive to run well, and those that are not conducive to production and most members request to be separated should be appropriately separated. Whether merging or splitting cooperatives, it must be negotiated and truly obtained the voluntary participation of cooperative cadres and members, and it must not be mechanically stipulated from above and forced the cooperative to implement it. Once the cooperative is established, in general, do not easily change it within a few years, except for those that must be separated or merged, which is of great benefit to consolidating the new production relations.

    Second, according to existing experience, villages with too much disparity in land ownership and income and basically different production and management objects are generally not suitable for forming a cooperative at present, because this is neither conducive to production nor conducive to unity. This experience should be valued and some existing disputes should be properly resolved. Scattered households in some remote mountainous areas can independently organize small cooperatives and small groups, or they can join nearby large cooperatives, but they should be allowed to decentralize production, individually record remuneration, and be responsible for their own profits and losses. Of course, some joint village cooperatives are indeed conducive to the development of production, conducive to unity, and can be run well, then they should continue to be run and should not be easily dismantled.

    Third, in order to maintain the past reasonable social division of labor and be conducive to production, non-agricultural production personnel, such as professional small traders, transporters, doctors, and teachers, can not join the agricultural cooperative. Those who have joined can decide to stay in the cooperative or leave the cooperative according to the principle of voluntariness. Rural professional small traders and transporters can be handled in accordance with the methods of socialist transformation of industry and commerce and transportation, which is conducive to maintaining the normal circulation of commodities between urban and rural areas. However, the above-mentioned part-time personnel and the family members of the above-mentioned professional personnel in rural areas should be absorbed into the cooperative according to the principle of voluntariness.

    Fourth, the leadership composition of the cooperative is one of the major issues in the organizational construction of the cooperative. In this regard, we must first pay attention to the principle of consolidating the advantages of poor peasants and strengthening unity with middle peasants, and at the same time, we must pay attention to not only selecting outstanding elements from among young and middle-aged people to participate in leadership, but also selecting outstanding elements from among the elderly to participate in leadership, so as to achieve harmonious cooperation, mutual respect, and mutual learning between young, middle-aged, and elderly people, so that all the strengths of young, middle-aged, and elderly people can be fully utilized. Any bias that underestimates young people or underestimates the elderly should be corrected.

    Fifth, the leading organs at the provincial, prefectural, and county levels must run agricultural cooperative cadre schools and short-term training courses to train various cadres (including management cadres and technical cadres) needed by the cooperative in a planned manner, and must attach importance to training women cadres. This work must be earnestly grasped and strengthened, and significant results should be achieved as soon as possible.

    Cadres stationed in the cooperative must be good at helping local cadres, respecting their opinions, and cultivating their ability to work independently. All decisions and technical measures within the cooperative must be consulted with the cadres of the cooperative in advance, and the phenomena of forced orders, paternalistic practices, and substitution must be resolutely overcome and prevented.

    Sixth, strengthen the democratic management of cooperatives. The production plan, labor plan, financial plan, and distribution plan of the cooperative must be democratically discussed and democratically decided in accordance with the cooperative charter. The members' congress and representatives' congress must be convened on time, and the cooperative's management committee and supervisory committee must be elected periodically. The cooperative's affairs must be reported to the members regularly, and the members must be mobilized to regularly supervise the cooperative's leadership and continuously improve the connection between the cooperative's cadres and members.

    Seventh, allowing former landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries who have abandoned reactionary activities in the countryside to participate in the production of agricultural cooperatives with distinction has proven to be beneficial to their transformation. This policy should continue to be implemented and the transformation of the above-mentioned personnel should be strengthened, while also being vigilant against possible sabotage activities by some of them.

    (8) Adjust the prices of certain agricultural products and improve rural purchasing and marketing work.

    The relationship between agricultural production and commerce is extremely close. In particular, cash crops, animal products, and sideline production are mainly produced for exchange, so the quality of commercial work, especially whether the price is appropriate, has a significant impact on agricultural production. Commercial work must be further improved, and the price policy must be conducive to stimulating production and promoting the comprehensive development of agricultural and sideline production. To this end:

    First, the purchase prices of certain agricultural products must be reasonably adjusted, and pricing and grading should be negotiated with farmers. Those whose prices are too low and hinder production must be appropriately increased, and the price difference between purchase and sale that is too large should be appropriately reduced, so that cooperatives and farmers can make a profit in order to give play to their production enthusiasm. At the same time, in order to make price adjustments more in line with actual conditions, the central and local governments should appropriately divide their labor. According to the central government's regulations on the division of labor in prices, the prices of products that are locally produced and sold locally are adjusted by the local government, but the reasonable parity between various products must be taken into account during the adjustment, and the problem of triggering too wide a range and causing price increases in turn should be prevented. At the same time, in order to take care of the reasonable parity between regions and various products, the scope of adjustment should be balanced by the relevant departments of the central government.

    Second, the "three fixes" work of the unified purchase and sale of grain should continue to be done well, overcoming the phenomenon of being too light or too heavy in some parts, and the policy of not increasing purchases with increased production must be adhered to. The total amount of grain purchased nationwide should remain unchanged at last year's level. The advance purchase system for major agricultural products should be improved, the amount of advance purchase deposits should be appropriately increased within the possible scope, and timely distribution should be guaranteed in order to help agricultural cooperatives establish a regular advance payment system for labor remuneration.

    Third, the number of goods purchased on a assigned basis, such as live pigs, must be based on the actual production situation of farmers and should also take into account the needs of farmers themselves.

    Fourth, improve the management and operation of commercial enterprises, reduce the number of commodity circulation links as much as possible, streamline enterprise management organizations, reduce management costs, and simplify purchasing and marketing procedures. At the same time, attention should be paid to strengthening the political education of commercial workers, further improving the work style of some personnel, and correcting behaviors such as suppressing prices and forcing the sale of goods that are divorced from the masses.

    Fifth, gradually establish a free market under the leadership of the socialist economy. Agricultural and sideline products outside the scope of the state's unified purchase and those commissioned by supply and marketing cooperatives, as well as surplus products beyond the completion of unified purchase tasks and the fulfillment of purchase contract obligations, can be freely bought and sold through this market. If there is a rush to buy products or price imbalances in the market, relevant departments can be convened under the leadership of the local Party and government to negotiate and adjust.

    Sixth, the tax rates and taxation methods for agricultural tax and sideline tax should also be adjusted and made necessary changes as soon as possible according to the new situation after cooperativization to benefit production.

    Seventh, the agricultural product processing industry should not be excessively concentrated in cities. Excessive concentration cannot meet farmers' requirements for feed and fertilizer, and it is also a reason for the decline in rural sideline production. Therefore, it is not appropriate to develop too many processing plants such as rice mills, cotton ginning mills, and oil presses in cities. In addition to supplying the necessary raw materials to existing processing plants, the remaining agricultural products should be processed by local townships and towns or dispersed by agricultural cooperatives. (The state can also supply farmers with raw grain for farmers to process themselves.) It is necessary to adjust the prices of by-products (bran, oil cake, etc.) that must be processed in cities and ensure that a certain proportion of the by-products are returned to the raw material producing areas.

    (9) Adjust the relationship between handicraft cooperatives and agricultural cooperatives.

    Handicrafts across the country have also basically achieved cooperativization. Due to the rapid development of the movement, the division of labor and collaboration between handicraft cooperatives and agricultural cooperatives in handicraft production has not been resolved in a timely manner, resulting in some abnormal phenomena: Handicraft workers in urban and rural areas and between regions compete for members and markets, disrupting the original division of labor and collaboration in handicrafts and forming a situation of supply and marketing imbalances and mutual restrictions. Some handicraft cooperatives restrict agricultural cooperatives from engaging in certain handicraft production activities, while some agricultural cooperatives pull handicraft workers to cities or set up retail outlets, blindly expanding production and restricting the supply of raw materials to urban handicrafts, lacking due care for professional handicrafts.

    In order to solve this problem, we must make overall arrangements in the spirit of taking into account both urban and rural areas.

    First, handicraft workers in urban and rural areas should be organized separately. Handicraft workers scattered in rural areas should generally join agricultural cooperatives according to the principle of voluntariness, and handicraft workers in towns and cities should join handicraft cooperatives. Handicraft cooperatives in towns and cities should not restrict the handicraft activities of agricultural cooperatives, and agricultural cooperatives should not absorb handicraft workers or set up retail outlets in cities. However, for the family members of handicraft workers in towns and cities who live in rural areas, agricultural cooperatives should absorb them into the cooperative according to their wishes.

    Second, rural professional handicraft workers with higher skills can form separate professional groups within the agricultural cooperative, separately calculate remuneration, and be responsible for their own profits and losses. If necessary, members of professional groups can also implement the method of being responsible for their own profits and losses, dispersing or going out to carry out production activities, and the cooperative should not restrict them. Their business guidance and market arrangements should be solved by the local Party and government-led handicraft management organizations and supply and marketing cooperatives in a coordinated manner, and the blockade between urban and rural areas and between regions should be lifted. Agricultural cooperatives can ask these professional groups to carry out the repair and manufacturing work needed by the cooperative and pay remuneration according to reasonable standards.

    Third, handicraft production should also increase planning and overcome blindness. Products that are traditionally operated locally and are needed by society should be vigorously operated. If new industries that did not exist in local history are built, it must be considered whether there is a market. At the same time, special attention should be paid to not disrupting the original division of labor and collaboration between rural sideline industries and urban handicrafts and the original supply and marketing relations between urban and rural areas and between regions of handicraft products, so as not to cause confusion.

    Fourth, there are still contradictions between certain sideline handicrafts in rural areas and urban handicrafts. In the spirit of taking into account both urban and rural areas and supporting each other with part-time care for professionals, relevant departments led by local Party and government organs should negotiate in a unified manner to solve the problems of product sales, raw material supply, and other issues in accordance with historical habits.

    (10) Strengthen the leadership of agricultural cooperatives in ethnic minority areas.

    The economic conditions in ethnic minority areas are generally very different from those in the interior. Their production and living habits have their own characteristics. Therefore, in the cooperative movement and the construction of cooperatives, work must be arranged according to the principle of fully respecting national voluntariness and the different national characteristics. Copying the experiences of the interior will affect production and also affect unity between ethnic groups.

    In multi-ethnic areas, in order to take care

    中共中央国务院关于加强农业生产合作社的生产领导和组织建设的指示
    （1956年9月12日）
    由于多年来农业合作化日益显示着的优越性和社会主义工业化成就的推动，由于大多数群众走社会主义道路的积极性迅速提高，特别是由于党的七届六中全会的决议和毛泽东同志关于农业合作化问题的报告的鼓舞，当着我们纠正了一部分同志的右倾保守思想以后，农业合作化高潮就以空前广阔的规模和极其深刻的程度在全国农村中开展起来了。运动的发展是迅速的，也是健康的。到今年春间我国大多数地区已经基本上实现了农业合作化。农业合作化的高潮引起了农业生产的高潮，党中央又适时地提出了十二年全国农业发展纲要（草案），为农业发展指出了长期奋斗的目标，进一步提高了广大农民的合作化和生产的积极性，在农田水利、积肥造肥、改进耕作技术、改变耕作制度、推广先进经验以及植树造林等等方面都做了空前巨大的工作。今年的小麦和早稻都是增产的，许多省份的秋季作物虽然遭受了严重的灾害，但是今年的粮食总产量仍然可能达到第一个五年计划原定的1957年的水平。今年的受灾面积大体与1954年相等，而粮食产量，比丰收的1955年仍有增加，这就越加证明了社会主义合作经济的优越性。在农业合作化方面取得的这样具有历史意义的伟大胜利，无疑地有利于加速实现我国的社会主义工业化和农业现代化。
    农业实现了合作化，农村生产关系根本改变以后，在新的生产关系下面，又出现了一系列新的问题和新的矛盾。同时，由于经验不足和部分同志在革命高潮面前一度产生的某些急躁情绪，因而在某些工作中带来了若干缺点。这些问题和缺点是在新的形势下和运动迅速前进中产生的，有的是不可避免或者难于完全避免的。我们应该肯定成绩，克服缺点，巩固胜利，继续前进，有准备有计划地争取在1957年基本上实现全国的高级合作化（部分边疆地区在外）；同时必须继续巩固和提高现有的合作社，调动一切积极因素，全面发展农业生产。为此目的，各级党委和人民委员会必须根据所属地区的具体情况，采取有效措施，努力解决以下一些问题：
    （一）保证粮棉需要，增产其他经济作物，发展畜牧业，开展多种经营，全面发展生产。
    粮食生产是农业经济发展的基础。棉花是第一位重要的经济作物。增产粮食和棉花，对于保证人民生活的需要和国民经济的发展，有头等重要的意义。因此，在农业生产上以增产粮棉为中心的方针，必须继续贯彻执行，这是丝毫不能动摇的。几年来各地抓紧粮棉增产是完全对的。
    但是，在保证粮棉增产的同时，还必须注意增产其他经济作物，发展畜牧业、林业、渔业和其他各种副业生产，开展多种经营，全面地发展农、副业生产。各种经济作物、畜牧业和各项副业生产占农村收入的比重很大，在许多省份甚至占农业总产值的百分之四、五十以上，如果忽视多种经营，势必影响到合作社和社员个人收入的增加，也同样会影响国民经济的平衡发展和人民生活上的需要。同时，农、林、渔、牧和各项副业、运输业、手工业生产都是农村经济不可分割的部分。各种生产之间有着相互支援的作用，只有实行多种经营，才能够更加有效地促进粮棉增产，才能够合理地利用土地，也才能够更好地调配全年的劳动时间，充分地提高劳动力的利用率和劳动生产率。因此，几年来由于多种原因所产生的某些经济作物、畜牧业和副业生产的落后状态，必须迅速加以改变。为此：
    第一，应该帮助合作社，根据本社的具体条件，根据需要（包括国家、合作社、社员）和可能，做出以粮、棉为主的（一般地区以粮食为主，棉花集中产区以棉花为主）全面发展生产的规划，并对耕地、劳力、畜力、资金、技术等方面作出全面的安排。在制定规划的时候，对于农民习惯种植的经济作物和习惯经营的各项副业生产，都不要盲目改种和停止经营，已经停止经营的应该迅速恢复，有可能发展的还应该努力发展。
    在工矿区和城市郊区，应该发展蔬菜、果类生产和家畜家禽饲养业，以适应城市的需要。
    第二，畜力在一个相当长的时期内仍是农业生产的主要动力，必须切实帮助合作社建立和改进耕畜的管理使用制度，一般要采取专人负责、分散喂养的办法。合作社要统筹解决饲料问题，国家在粮食统购中，也应该按“三定”的办法留足饲料。要防止使用过度，特别注意保护种畜、母畜、孕畜和幼畜。做好牲畜的配种、保胎和兽疫防治工作。有些农业合作社片面强调降低生产费用，过分提高耕畜的劳动强度，把本来并不多余的耕畜也出卖了，宰杀了，这种现象如不迅速设法制止，将给今后的生产造成很大困难。为了调剂耕畜，国家商业部门应该负责解决牲畜的交流的问题。
    在牧区，要有计划地发展牲畜和畜产品，为了促进畜牧业的顺利发展，也要在可能条件下适当地发展农业生产，以解决人民粮食和牲畜的饲料问题。
    发展养猪，对于解决肥料，对于增加合作社和社员的收入，对于人民肉食供应和出口的需要，都是极其重要的，要求各地按照国务院今年7月1日发出的指示，切实贯彻执行。
    第三，在山区一般应该制定农、林、牧和其他副业相结合的全面的山区生产规划，并且应该根据宜林、宜农、宜牧等不同的具体情况，规定不同山区的不同生产重点。在荒山垦殖时，必须按照水土保持条例，严格注意水土保持工作，不准废林为地。
    第四，农业生产合作社应该积极发展副业生产，除了必须集体经营的，可以由社统一经营外，一切利于分散经营的，应该尽可能鼓励和帮助社员家庭各自经营或提倡社有私营，做到合理分工，有利生产。在初办的头几年内，合作社应该集中力量办好农业、畜牧业、及主要的副业生产，其他利于分散经营的大量的副业，应该让社员经营，不加区别地把副业生产一律集中到合作社或者不应有的限制社员搞副业生产的偏向，都必须纠正。当然，只顾社员家庭副业生产，妨碍社内集体生产的偏向也应该防止。
    （二）在国家计划指导下，保持合作社生产经营的独立性
    计划生产是社会主义经济的基本特点之一。我国国民经济的发展是有计划的。合作社的生产，也必须是有计划的，必须在国家经济计划的指导下进行生产，这是应该肯定的。在农业计划问题上，一方面，今年年初有些地方、有些合作社，一度把粮食生产计划定得太高，脱离实际，反而失去了计划的指导作用。这种偏向一般地已经纠正过来。另一方面，各种作物播种面积的分配计划，上面又定得过死，往往不符合实际情况，机械地要下面执行，结果就助长了下面的强迫命令。这种毛病，必须纠正。
    农业生产不同于工业生产，农业生产的很大一部分是自给性的生产，并且受自然条件的影响，地域性很大，农业合作社并不是国营企业，而是集体所有制或者部分集体所有制。因此，绝不能像对待工业一样来对待农业的生产计划。制定农业生产计划，必须采取从上而下和从下而上相结合的方法，并且要由中央和地方分级管理。中央要逐步做到由规定生产计划，过渡到规定农产品的采购计划和调拨计划。中央的农业生产和采购计划只规定到省，省可以根据中央计划和自己地区的情况具体安排自己的计划。中央和上级规定的生产计划指标，地方和下级可以作适当的机动调整。在计划方法上，可以对不同的作物，采取不同的方法；对于粮食，国家可以只规定粮食总产量的指标和分品种的征购指标、调拨指标，对于商品性较大的经济作物和畜产品，国家可以规定比较详细的分项采购指标，对于零星分散的小杂粮、农副产品和土特产品，不便列入国家计划的，有的可以列入省县计划，有的可以由采购部门和商业部门直接同合作社订立合同，用合同和价格政策来推动合作社有计划地进行生产。
    在完成国家的农业税和农产品的统购任务、履行同其他经济部门所订立的合同义务的前提下，农业合作社可以自由地按照自己的需要和可能制定全社的生产计划。中央和地方提出的计划，对于农业合作社都有参考和指导作用，但不能直接命令合作社样样按照上面的计划办事。只有这样，才能真正保持农业生产合作社，在国家经济计划的指导下生产经营的独立性，从而提高合作社的生产积极性。
    （三）积极地、稳步地、因地制宜地实行技术改革，推广先进经验
    在我国尚未实现农业机械化，尚不可能大规模垦荒的具体情况下（根据可能各地应努力争取小量开荒，尽可能扩大耕地面积），我们当前发展农业生产的主要途径，是在合作化基础上依靠农民的劳动积极性逐步进行技术改革（包括兴修水利，平整土地，改良土壤等农田基本建设，及改良农具、推广良种、积肥造肥、防治病虫害、改进耕作技术、改变耕作制度等），来提高单位面积产量。
    几年以来，特别是去冬以来，各地都抓住了合作化所创造的有利条件，采取了积极的方针，进行了技术改革，推广了先进经验，例如兴修小型水利，变旱地为水田，变单季为双季，变稀播为密植以及推广新式农具、选用良种、开辟肥源等等，工作量之大是前所未有的，成绩也是巨大的。但是，由于在推广的过程中，有的计划过大，技术指导不足，有的步骤过急，有的对农业生产的地域性照顾不够，一般化地推广，因而在一些地方发生了强迫命令，造成损失，脱离群众。当前的任务是既要总结各地成功的经验，积极的加以推广，又要分析局部失败的原因，加以纠正。
    中央认为：推行技术改革，推广先进的增产经验，方针必须是积极的，不能保守。但做法必须是因地制宜的，步骤必须是稳妥慎重的，不能冒进。必须积极吸取一切外来的先进经验，包括外国和外地的成功经验，又必须严格注意地区的适应性，必须经过本地试验成功之后才能推广。比较有把握的，可以分两步走，第一步重点试验，第二步大面积推广；把握少的，应该分三步走，第一步重点试验，第二步多点试验，第三步大面积推广。推行这些工作的时候，还必须根据群众自愿的原则，凡是农业合作社干部和群众不愿意采取的，即令确实能够增产，也只能经过示范说服，而不能强迫推广。当然，对于技术改革采取自流放任态度也是不对的。因此，必须加强国营农牧场的示范作用，加强农业技术指导站的工作，加强农业科学研究工作，使科学技术和农民的实际经验正确地结合起来。既要把外来的先进经验介绍到群众中去，又要用先进的农业科学，把农民群众，特别是老农老圃的增产经验加以总结，在条件相同的地区推广。只有根据这些原则，来实行技术改革，来推广先进经验，才能避免错误，达到增产的目的。
    （四）加强劳动管理，提高劳动生产率
    提高劳动生产率，是提高合作社生产最重要的条件，是保证社员增加收入的根本源泉。合理地组织社员的集体劳动，又是提高劳动生产率的一个中心环节。在这一方面各地创造了一些成功的经验。但是由于经验不足和劳动规划照顾不周、劳动管理上还存在着一些缺点，劳动效率不高、窝工浪费的现象，在不少地方仍是存在的。为要达到逐步提高劳动生产率，在劳动管理方面，目前要着重注意以下几个方面：
    第一，必须经常重视按照生产的需要，不断保持劳动计划的平衡。在制定与修改劳动计划的时候，不仅要保证全年一般的平衡，还要保证每个生产季节的平衡。要做到农忙季节劳力够用，农闲季节剩余劳力也有出路。做到农业与副业、当前生产与基本建设各方面的劳力需要都得到妥善安排。对各个生产队、生产组之间也要注意劳力平衡，避免闲忙不均。对于男劳力与女劳力，全劳力与半劳力还要注意合理地配合使用，做到各尽所能，共同发挥劳动积极性。
    第二，合理地调整劳动组织。现在有些地方的生产队、生产组过大，应该根据现时的生产技术条件和田间作业的需要，加以调整。根据各地经验，在目前条件下，一般地区以小型的队（平均二三十户至三四十户）小型的组（平均七八户）更为适宜。
    第三，加强定额管理。这是一项非常细致而具体的工作，我们不应满足于一般定额的规定。农业定额和工业定额不同，它具有极大的地方性，还经常受着自然条件变化的影响。因此，省、县规定的定额标准只能供各社参考，不可能也不需要强调统一。各社规定的定额标准，必要时也应该根据情况变化加以调整，并且应该使生产队在基本不变动包工的工分总数的前提下，有权作必要的机动调整。还必须注意及时总结经验，采取一些推行定额的过渡步骤，逐步使定额管理趋于完善。
    第四，提高劳动生产率，应该从合理改善劳动组织，合理使用劳力，加强劳动保护，尽可能改良工具，改进和提高生产技术等方面来达到目的。任何与此相反的不正确做法，如不适当地延长劳动时间，增加劳动强度，或者不顾社员体质强制派工等做法都是不许可的。对于妇女社员，尤其对孕妇，特别要注意劳动保护。
    第五，在服从集体劳动需要的前提下，要适当照顾社员经营家庭副业和处理家务的时间。在这一方面，许多合作社有限制太死的缺点。今后应该根据社章让社员在保证了社内规定的劳动日以外的时间，有自由支配自己劳动的权利。
    （五）做好合作社的分配工作分配问题是巩固合作社的关键之一，是社会主义生产关系的一个重要方面。社会主义经济的优越性，也要通过分配，同社员的个人利益结合起来，才能为广大社员所公认。必须了解生产固然是分配的基础，但是如果分配不当，必然会反过来影响生产的发展。
    集体利益是个人利益的基础，但是如果过分强调集体利益，不能适当地照顾个人利益，结果也必然会损害集体利益。因此，生产与分配，国家利益、集体利益与个人利益必须正确地结合，中央提出要把合作社收入的60％—70％分配给社员，争取90％的社员都能增加收入，就是实现这种正确结合的具体保证。但是由于多数合作社是初办的，底子薄，加上今年春间有些社铺张浪费、基建开支过大、副业收入减少等原因，要实现90％的社员增加收入，还是一个非常艰巨的任务。为此，要特别努力完成今年下半年农副业增产计划，并在这个基础上，做好合作社的分配工作。
    第一，必须坚持勤俭办社的方针。生产费用应该在保证增产的前提下，力求节约。非生产费用应尽量不开支或少开支。为了便利社员实行财务监督，应该按月或按季公开社内账目，认真实行经济民主，并要坚决反对铺张浪费和任何贪污现象。
    第二，在保证完成国家的农业税及留下必要的生产费用外，合作社的公积金、公益金，今年一般地区不要超过总收入的5％。农业税的正税，已经确定维持去年的水平，不再增加，地方附加也不能增加过多。要做到使合作社收入的60％至70％真正能够分配给社员，在年景正常的地区，要努力争取实现90％的社员都增加收入。
    各地合作社的财务工作，大多数都较薄弱，各地党政必须大力加强这一方面的领导。
    第三，在分配中，必须坚持按劳取酬、多劳多得和男女同工同酬的原则，按阶级成份谁穷谁多得的原则或按人口分配的原则都是错误的。对于劳力少或劳力特别弱的社员和遭遇了不幸事故的社员，应该从生产安排方面，从公益金方面给予适当的照顾。
    在分配粮食的时候，对于劳力强、出工多，因而口粮需要量也较高的社员，应该给以适当的照顾。
    第四，应该建立劳动报酬的定期预支制度，首先争取做到在青黄不接的时期，按月预支或预借。这对于解决贫苦社员日常生活的困难、提高社员劳动积极性有重大的作用。预支款项的来源，主要是社内副业收入和农产品预购款。
    第五，合作社对五保户应根据当前生产水平认真予以照顾。除在可能条件下适当安排他们参加生产外，应由公益金和部分土地报酬并结合国家的救济粮款解决他们的生活困难，使之不低于入社前的水平。
    （六）贯彻执行互利政策
    坚持互利政策，是我国农业合作化顺利成功的基本条件之一。互利政策不仅在建社时期重要，对于长期巩固合作社也同样重要。不仅在建社的时候，要按照互利原则，来处理贫农和中农入社的生产资料，而且在处理社员彼此经济关系的各种问题的时候，都不能离开互利原则。因此必须继续贯彻执行互利政策，首先要适当地解决下列问题：
    第一，不少地方，林木入社折价偏低，甚至对一部分成林、幼林不作价。有些地方，不应该入社的零星树木也强制入社。为了有利于保护林木，发展林业生产，加强合作社内部团结，必须根据群众的意见，按照农业合作社章程的规定加以处理。未作价的要认真作价，作价过低的要适当调整。这不仅有利于社内团结，而且也有利于生产，有利于争取90％的社员增加收入。在这方面不应该怕麻烦。但是，对于那些原来处理得基本合理，社员一般没有意见的，则不要重新翻案。
    第二，部分地方耕畜农具和副业工具入社没有作价或作价过低的也应该按照上述精神加以处理。有些副业设备较大，价值较高，作价入社以后，三、五年内还清价款确有困难的，可以商得社员的同意，酌量延长还清期限。
    第三，为了取信于社员，对社员投资及社员的耕畜农具价款超过股金部分应该还本的必须还本，应该付息的必须付息，社员应得的林木报酬也须照付。
    第四，在鼓励社员向社内投资的时候，必须遵照自愿原则。禁止任何强迫摊派或硬扣的办法。此外，信用社吸取社员的存款，除解决社员生产生活困难外，还可以用来补助农业社资金的不足，但信用社必须坚持存款自愿，取款自由，保守存款人秘密的原则，不得强迫存款。农业社冻结社员在信用社存款的错误作法也必须禁止。
    对于合作社员投入社内的一切肥料，必须合理作价，以鼓励社员积肥造肥。
    第五，自留地有的地方留得太少，甚至不留。为了满足社员家庭饲养业和日常生活的需要，应按社章规定允许社员留够。但是也不应留得过多。
    （七）加强合作社的组织建设
    合作社的组织建设，必须充分体现社会主义经济制度的原则，又必须照顾当前的具体条件，使合作社的组织形式与当前的管理水平、技术水平、生产内容相适应。
    第一，合作社规模大小，是合作社组织建设的一个重大问题。现有合作社的规模多数是合理的，但是部分地方也曾一度出现片面贪大的偏向，给经营管理和合作社内部团结增加了一些困难。中央认为合作社规模的大小，应该根据有利于生产，有利于团结，适合当前的管理水平，便于联系社员的原则加以规定。在目前条件下，合作社的规模，山区以一百户左右，丘陵区二百户左右，平原区三百户左右为适宜，超过三百户以上的大村也可以一村一社。今后建社并社的时候，应该按照这种规模进行。至于现有的大社，凡能办好的应该努力办好，凡不利于生产、多数社员要求分开的，应该适当分开。无论并社或分社，都必须经过协商确实取得合作社干部、社员的自愿，决不能只由上面机械规定，强制合作社执行。合作社建立起来之后，除了确实必须分开或必须合并的以外，一般在若干年内，不要轻易变动，这对于巩固新的生产关系是有很大好处的。
    第二，根据现有经验，土地占有和收入悬殊太大以及生产经营对象基本不同的村庄，在目前一般不宜共组一社，因为这既不利于生产，也不利于团结。应该重视这一经验，并恰当解决已经存在的某些纠纷。某些偏僻山区的散居户，可以自行组织小型社、小型组，也可以参加附近的大社，但是应该允许他们分散生产，单独记酬，自负盈亏。当然，有些联村社，确实有利于发展生产，有利于团结，并且能够办好的，则应该继续办下去，不要轻易拆散。
    第三，为了保持过去的合理的社会分工，有利于生产，凡非农业的生产人员，如专业的小商贩、运输业者、医生、教员等等可以不必加入农业社。已加入者，按自愿原则决定留社或出社。乡村的专业小商贩和运输业者，可以按工商业和运输业社会主义改造的办法处理，这样做对于保持城乡商品的正常流转是有利的。但是对于上述的兼业人员及上述专业人员在农村的家属，就应该按自愿原则吸收入社。
    第四，合作社的领导成份是合作社组织建设中的重大问题之一。在这一方面，我们必须首先注意巩固贫农优势，加强和中农团结的原则，同时还要注意，不仅要选拔青壮年中的优秀分子参加领导，也要注意选拔老年人中的优秀分子参加领导，做到青、壮、老年互相和谐合作，互相尊重，互相学习，使青年、壮年、老年人的所有长处都能充分发挥。任何轻视青年人或轻视老年人的偏向都应该加以纠正。
    第五，省、专、县三级领导机关，必须举办农业合作干部学校和短期训练班，有计划地训练合作社所需要的各种干部（包括管理干部和技术干部），并要重视培养妇女干部，在这方面的工作必须切实抓紧并加强领导，尽快做出显著的成绩来。
    驻社干部必须善于帮助当地干部，尊重他们的意见，培养他们的独立工作能力，社内一切决定和技术措施，必须事先同合作社的干部协商，必须坚决克服和防止强迫命令、包办代替的现象。
    第六，要加强合作社的民主管理。合作社的生产计划、劳动计划、财务计划、分配方案，都必须按照社章经过民主讨论民主决定。社员大会、代表大会必须按期召开，合作社的管理委员会和监察委员会必须实行定期选举。社务必须定期向社员报告，必须发动社员经常监督社的领导，不断改善合作社干部和社员的联系。
    第七，有区别地允许过去的地主、富农和乡村中已经放弃反动活动的反革命分子参加农业合作社的生产，证明是有利于对他们的改造的。应该继续贯彻执行这一政策，加强对上述人员的改造工作，同时也要警惕其中某些人可能发生的破坏活动。
    （八）调整某些农产品的价格、改善农村购销工作
    农业生产和商业的关系，是极其密切的。特别是经济作物、畜产品和副业生产，主要是为了交换而生产的，所以商业工作做的好坏，特别是价格适当与否，对于农业生产具有重大的影响，必须进一步做好商业工作，尤其价格政策必须有利于刺激生产，有利于促进农副业生产的全面发展。为此：
    第一，必须合理地调整某些农产品的收购价格，评级定价应和农民协商。凡是价格偏低阻碍生产的，必须适当提高，购销差价过大的应该适当缩小，务使合作社和农民有利可图，以便发挥他们的生产积极性。同时，为了使调整价格能够更加切合实际情况，中央与地方应该适当分工，按照中央关于物价分工的规定，凡属当地自产当地自销的产品价格由地方负责调整，但在调整时必须照顾各种产品间的合理比价，要防止牵动面太广，造成轮番提价的毛病。同时为了照顾地区间和各种产品间比价的合理，调整的幅度应由中央有关部门加以平衡。
    第二，要继续做好粮食统购统销的“三定”工作，克服部分畸轻畸重的现象，还必须坚持增产不增购的方针，全国粮食统购的总数维持在去年的水平上不变。要健全对于主要农产品的预购制度，在可能范围内要适当增加预购定金，并且保证及时发放，以便帮助农业合作社建立劳动报酬的定期预支制度。
    第三，派购商品的数量，如毛猪等，必须根据农民的实际生产状况，并且应该兼顾农民自身的需要。
    第四，改善商业企业的经营管理工作，尽可能减少商品流转环节，精简企业管理机构，降低管理费用，简化购销手续。同时，应该注意加强商业工作人员的政治教育工作，进一步改进某些人员的工作作风，对于压级压价、强迫推销商品等脱离群众的行为，必须纠正。
    第五，逐步建立在社会主义经济领导下的自由市场，凡是国家统购和委托供销社收购的范围以外的农副业产品，以及完成统购任务和履行收购合同义务以外的多余产品，都可以通过这个市场自由买卖。如果市场发生抢购产品或价格失调时，则可在当地党政领导下召集有关部门互相协商，调整处理。
    第六，农业税和副业税的税率和征税办法，也应该根据合作化后的新情况，尽快地加以调整和作必要的改变，以利生产。
    第七，农产品加工业不宜过分集中于城市。过分集中就不能满足农民对于饲料和肥料的要求，同时，这也是造成农村副业生产下降的一个原因。因此，不宜在城市过多地发展碾米、轧花、榨油等加工厂，除了给现在加工厂供应必要的原料以外，其余的农产品应该尽量由当地乡、镇加工或由农业合作社分散加工。（国家还可供应农民原粮，由农民自己加工）必须在城市加工的，也应该调整副产品（糠麸、油饼等）的价格，并且保证一定比例的副产品返还原料产地。
    （九）调整手工业合作社与农业
        合作社的关系
    全国的手工业也已经基本上实现了合作化，由于运动发展迅速，手工业合作社和农业合作社在手工业生产上的分工协作问题，没有能够及时加以解决，因而存在着某些不正常的现象：城乡之间与地区之间的手工业互争社员，互争市场，打乱了手工业原来的分工协作关系，形成了供销失调、互相限制的局面。有些手工业社限制农业社从事某些手工业生产活动，有些农业社则到城市拉手工工人或设立门市部，盲目扩大生产，并限制对城市手工业原料的供应，对专业手工业缺乏应有的照顾。
    为了解决这个问题，必须本着城乡兼顾的精神，统筹安排。
    第一，城、乡的手工业者应该分别加以组织，分散在乡村的手工业者，根据自愿原则，一般的应该参加农业社，城镇的手工业者应该参加手工业合作社，城镇的手工业社不应该限制农业社的手工业活动，农业社也不应该到城市吸收手工工人和设立门市部。但对于城镇手工业者居住乡村的家属，农业社应该根据他们的自愿，吸收他们入社。
    第二，乡村技艺性较高的专业性的手工业者，可以在农业社内组成单独的专业小组，单独计酬，自负盈亏。专业小组成员之间，必要时也可实行自负盈亏的办法，分散或外出进行生产活动，合作社不应限制他们。他们的业务指导和市场安排等问题，由当地党政领导手工业管理机构和供销社统筹解决，要取消城乡和地区之间的封锁。农业社可以要求这些专业小组进行本社所需要的修理和制造工作，并且按照合理的标准付给报酬。
    第三，手工业生产，也应该增加计划性，克服盲目性。凡是当地有经营习惯又为社会所需要的产品，就应该大力经营。如果新建当地历史上没有的行业，就必须考虑到有无销路。同时应该特别注意，不要打乱农村副业与城镇手工业之间原来的分工协作关系和手工业产品的城乡之间、地区之间原来的供销关系，以免引起混乱。
    第四，农村中还有某些副业性的手工业和城镇手工业之间仍然有矛盾。应该本着城乡兼顾和兼业照顾专业互相支援的精神，按照历史习惯由地方党政机关领导有关主管部门协商，统一解决产品销路、原料供应等问题。
    （十）加强少数民族地区农业合作社的领导
    少数民族地区的经济条件，一般地都与内地有很大的差别，他们的生产和生活习惯都有自己的特点，因此，在合作化运动和合作社的建设工作上，都必须根据完全尊重民族自愿的原则和不同的民族特点来安排工作，照搬内地经验，就会影响生产，也会影响民族之间的团结。
    在多民族的地区，为了照顾各民族生产、生活和宗教信仰上各方面的不同情况，以各民族分别建社为宜。只有在各民族社员无法单独建社或者有其他必要时，才可以建立民族联合社。
    在民族联合社中，应该注意发挥各民族的特长和发展各民族习惯经营的各种生产，特别要注意照顾和保护少数民族社员的利益，以保证各民族社员都能够增加收入，如几个民族彼此利益悬殊难以兼顾的就决不许可勉强并社。要特别注意培养少数民族的领导干部，在民族联合社中必须按照合作社章程的规定，吸收少数民族的优秀人物参加社的领导工作，还要十分注意尊重各民族的风俗习惯。
    在牧业地区发展牧业合作社，必须采取更加慎重的方针。牧业地区的各级领导机关应该在有利于发展畜牧业和其他条件许可的原则下，认真地亲自动手，重点试办，取得经验，再逐步推广。任何过早的过急的做法，都要防止。
    （十一）加强农村基层组织的工作
    农村基层组织，在社会主义革命和生产高潮中起了巨大的作用，干部水平也有了显著的提高。但是，必须指出，在农村合作化和撤区并乡以来，基层组织不但没有适应新形势的需要相应的加强，有些地方反而有削弱的趋势。不少地方，在撤区并乡的时候，调走了大批区级干部，没有给乡组织留下必要的领导骨干，以致削弱了基层组织的领导。另一方面，有些同志在思想上认为合作化以后一切事情好办了，对新的困难估计不足，对新形势下必须更高度的发扬民主认识不够，命令主义和简单化的作风普遍有所滋长，并且大大地减弱了农村的政治工作。各级党委必须重视这种现象，迅速加以改进。
    第一，必须从思想上重视基层组织工作，大力加强党在农村中的领导，必须懂得一切方针政策都要依靠党政基层组织来执行，才能最后实现，特别是在刚刚实现合作化以后，农村出现了许多新情况和新问题，对于处理这些新的问题又是缺乏经验的。因此，任何对于农村中党政基层组织的作用的削弱和忽视，都会使党和人民的事业受到损失。
    第二，撤区并乡要审慎从事，并且不要与并社升级同时进行，在撤区并乡时，一定要留下必要的区乡主要干部，不能层层上调，削弱乡和社的领导力量。
    第三，必须坚持群众路线的工作作风。农村支部和党员仍然应该深入群众，有系统地进行调查研究工作，了解群众的思想情绪，以便及时地改善合作社的领导。在社内，应该贯彻执行民主办社的方针，凡社内大事，都必须与社员商量，坚持从群众中来、到群众中去的工作方法，只有这样，才能够真正在民主基础上实现集中领导，而不致把集中领导变成少数人的独断专行。
    第四，明确党政社的分工，克服党社不分社政不分的混乱现象，党支部在实现对于合作社的领导时，不能事事干涉，包办代替。原由乡人民政府办理的行政工作，应该仍由政府办理，不能由社代办。党政社的干部兼职过多的现象，必须改变。
    除上述问题外，各地党政还必须重视和加强对灾区的生产救灾工作，受灾重大的地区，一切工作更必须以展开生产救灾为中心。各地党政应该根据受灾具体情况，定出有效办法，切实执行。
    上述这些问题都是为了顺利完成合作化，巩固合作化的伟大胜利，适应当前生产高潮的需要所必须解决的问题。这些问题解决了，就一定会调动一切积极因素，进一步巩固合作社，进一步促进农业生产的高涨。各级党政领导机关在目前以至在最近两三年内必须继续大力加强对农村工作方面的领导，尤其是各级党委的主要负责同志，必须继续执行六中全会的指示，亲自动手，抓紧完成和巩固农业合作化的工作，认真深入实际，及时总结经验，使自己变成内行，做到使我们的领导，能够完全适应于合作化后新形势的需要。
    为了顺利实现上述指示，希望各级党政领导机关和国家各有关部门，根据各地区和各部门工作的实际情况，切实研究本指示，定出具体办法，坚决贯彻执行，同时报告党中央和国务院。
