Xinhua News Agency, September 27th, New York (TASS): The United Nations Security Council held a meeting on September 26th and decided to include both the Anglo-French and Egyptian proposals on the Suez Canal issue on the agenda.

    The first to speak during the discussion was the British representative, Dixon. He firmly advocated prioritizing the discussion of the Anglo-French proposal.

    The French representative, Cornut-Gentille, suggested postponing the next meeting of the Security Council to allow the foreign ministers of some countries who were about to arrive to participate in the substantive discussions.

    The United States representative, Lodge, welcomed the referral of the issue to the Security Council by Britain and France. He said that he would vote in favor of including both proposals on the agenda, but he added a reservation, saying that he did not agree with Egypt's accusations against Britain and France.

    The Soviet representative, Sobolev, pointed out in his speech that after Egypt nationalized the Suez Canal Company, the British and French governments immediately exerted crude and unjustified pressure on Egypt, using economic sanctions and beginning to implement military measures. Sobolev said that since the actions of the Western countries had heightened the tension in the Near East, the United Nations could not but participate in the resolution of the Suez Canal issue.

    The Soviet delegation supported the request to include the issue raised by the Egyptian government on the Security Council's agenda.

    After refuting the slanders of Britain and France against Egypt and pointing out that the issue of whether the government of any country nationalizes a company is essentially a matter within the internal affairs of that government, Sobolev said that, given the Security Council's responsibility to listen to the opinions of both sides of a dispute and to maintain objectivity in handling any dispute, the Soviet delegation advocated including both items on the provisional agenda on the formal agenda. The Soviet delegation also believed that the issue raised by the Egyptian government should be given priority for discussion.

    The Yugoslav representative, Brilej, advocated adopting the provisional agenda as it was. He also advocated that the Security Council discuss the two issues simultaneously.

    Due to seven delegations (the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, the United States, Iran, Cuba, Peru, and the Chiang Kai-shek clique) voting in favor, the Egyptian proposal was passed for inclusion on the agenda. In the vote, four delegations (France, Britain, Australia, and Belgium) abstained. The Anglo-French proposal was unanimously passed for inclusion on the agenda.

    The Yugoslav suggestion of discussing the two issues simultaneously was rejected. No vote was taken on the order of discussion of the two agenda items.

    The meeting passed a resolution inviting the Egyptian representative to participate in the discussion of the issues included on the agenda.

    The date of the next meeting of the Security Council will be decided by the President of the Security Council after consulting with the representatives of the countries on the Security Council.

    关于苏伊士问题的埃及提案和英法提案
    安理会通过一并列入议程
    并决议邀请埃及代表参加讨论
    据新华社27日讯　据塔斯社纽约27日讯：联合国安全理事会9月26日举行会议，决定把关于苏伊士运河问题的英法提案和埃及提案都列入议程。
    在讨论中第一个发言的是英国代表狄克逊。他坚决主张优先讨论英法的提案。
    法国代表戈尔尼—让蒂主张安全理事会下一次会议延期举行，以便即将到来的一些国家的外交部长能够参加实质问题的讨论。
    美国代表洛奇欢迎英国和法国把问题提到安全理事会。他说，他将投票赞成把两个提案都列入议程，然而他又作了保留说，他丝毫不同意埃及对英法两国提出的控诉。
    苏联代表索波列夫在发言中指出，在埃及把苏伊士运河公司收归国有之后，英法政府就立刻对埃及施加粗暴的、毫无理由的压力，对它使用了经济制裁，开始实行一些军事性的措施。索波列夫说，既然西方国家的行动使得中近东的局势紧张起来，联合国就不能不参与苏伊士运河问题的解决。
    苏联代表团支持关于把埃及政府提出的问题列入安全理事会议程的请求。
    索波列夫在驳斥英法两国对埃及的诬蔑并指出无论哪一个国家的政府把一个公司收归国有的问题实质上是属于这个政府内政权限的问题之后说，苏联代表团鉴于安全理事会有责任倾听争执双方的意见和在处理任何争端时保持客观态度，主张把临时议程中的两点都列入正式议程。苏联代表团并认为应当优先讨论埃及政府提出的问题。
    南斯拉夫代表布里列伊主张按原样通过临时议程。他还主张安理会同时讨论两个问题。
    由于七个代表团（苏联、南斯拉夫、美国、伊朗、古巴、秘鲁和蒋介石分子）投赞成票，埃及的提案被通过列入议程，在表决中四个代表团（法国、英国、澳大利亚和比利时）弃权。英法提出的提案被一致通过列入议程。
    南斯拉夫关于同时讨论两个问题的建议被否决了。两点议程讨论的先后问题没有表决。
    会议通过决议，邀请埃及代表参加讨论列入议程的问题。
    安全理事会下次会议日期将由安理会主席在同安理会各国代表商量以后决定。
