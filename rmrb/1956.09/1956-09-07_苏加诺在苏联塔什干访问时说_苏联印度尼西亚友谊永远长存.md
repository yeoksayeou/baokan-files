Xinhua News Agency, September 6th: TASS reports: On September 4th, the President of the Republic of Indonesia, Sukarno, and his entourage arrived in Tashkent, the capital of the Uzbek Republic, by plane from Sverdlovsk. He said to those who welcomed him: We are convinced that the friendship between the Indonesian people and the Soviet people is a sincere and lasting friendship, and the friendship and brotherhood between these two countries will last forever.

After a short rest in Tashkent, Sukarno went to a famous mosque there to pray and met with Soviet Muslim leaders. That evening, he watched an artistic performance by famous Uzbek artists.

On the morning of September 5th, the Indonesian President and his entourage traveled by car to Alchiq, the center of Uzbekistan's electric power, chemical, and mechanical industries, and visited the Alchiq Electric Chemical Plant. On the way back to Tashkent, they visited the Qizil-Uzbek collective farm to learn about the farm's production and management.

During the visit to this collective farm, Sukarno and his party were invited by the chairman of the farm to visit the farm's garden and have lunch with the members.

After returning to Tashkent, Sukarno and others visited a local normal college and then went to the "Pakhtakor Stadium" to attend a grand mass rally held in his honor.

At the mass rally, President Sukarno delivered a long speech to the 75,000 citizens of Tashkent who welcomed him. He said, friends, you welcome me here with love and enthusiastic cheers. The feelings expressed by your joy, love, and friendship are not for any one individual, but for the entire Indonesian people. What you are welcoming here is not only the Indonesian people, but also the ideal of freedom, the ideal of equality and peace. You and we are fighting to realize this ideal. To fight for this ideal means to try to enable people to live in a peaceful environment, so that they can enjoy freedom and true happiness.

The Indonesian people have been doing their best to fight to realize the ideals we have mentioned. Friends, that is why we have a deep sense of brotherhood and friendship with you. Indeed, is there a friendship more intimate than the friendship between two warriors? No, there is no friendship more intimate or solid than this! And that is why the friendship between our two peoples is so strong.

Sukarno said that the Indonesian people cherish the ideas of freedom, happiness, equality, and peace in their hearts. In our national life, this idea is concretely expressed in the famous principle of "Pancasila" (i.e., the "Five Principles"). However, there is another "Pancasila" five principles announced at the Bandung Asian-African Conference in April 1955. The latter five principles are supported not only by the Asian and African countries participating in the Bandung Conference, but also by many countries in the world, including the Soviet Union. Today, all those who cherish peace and are fighting for peace and against imperialism, capitalism, and colonialism recognize these principles.

Today, the idea of peaceful coexistence is widespread throughout the world. It has captured the hearts of hundreds of millions of people. These ideas will continue to exist and develop until peace is rebuilt throughout the world, until freedom triumphs throughout the world, and until all countries begin to respect each other. The idea of peaceful coexistence will continue to develop and will be accepted by more and more countries. I ask all men and women around the world to work together and fight for lasting peace.

### 苏加诺在苏联塔什干访问时说  苏联印度尼西亚友谊永远长存

    苏加诺在苏联塔什干访问时说
    苏联印度尼西亚友谊永远长存
    据新华社6日讯　据塔斯社报道：9月4日，印度尼西亚共和国总统苏加诺和他的随行人员乘飞机由斯维德洛夫斯克到达乌兹别克共和国首都塔什干。他对欢迎他的人说：我们确信，印度尼西亚人民同苏联人民的友谊是一种诚挚而持久的友谊，这两国之间的友谊和兄弟之情将永远长存。
    到塔什干以后，经过短时间的休息，苏加诺即前往这里一个著名的清真寺作礼拜，并且会见了苏联的穆斯林领袖。当天晚上，他观看了由著名的乌兹别克艺术家演出的艺术表演会。
    9月5日上午，印度尼西亚总统和他的随行人员乘汽车前往乌兹别克的电力、化学和机械工业中心阿尔奇克，参观了阿尔奇克电力化学工厂。在回塔什干的途中，他们顺便访问了克齐尔——乌兹别克集体农庄，了解了农庄的生产和管理情况。
    在这个集体农庄参观的时候，苏加诺一行应农庄主席的邀请，还观赏了农庄的花园，并且同庄员们一道用午餐。
    回到塔什干以后，苏加诺等参观了市内的一个师范学院，然后从那里前往“帕斯赫塔科尔运动场”参加为他举行的一个盛大的群众欢迎会。
    在群众大会上，苏加诺总统向欢迎他的七万五千塔什干市民发表了长篇演说。他说，朋友们，你们在这里用爱和热烈的欢呼欢迎我。你们的高兴、爱和友谊所表达的感情并不是对某一个个人，而是对全体印度尼西亚人民的感情。你们在这里所欢迎的不仅仅是印度尼西亚人民，同时也是欢迎自由的理想，欢迎平等和和平的理想。你们和我们都为实现这个理想而斗争。为这个理想而斗争意味着设法使人民能够在和平环境中生活，使他们能够享受自由和真正的幸福。
    印度尼西亚人民一直尽全力进行斗争，来实现我们所提到的理想，朋友们，这就是为什么我们对你们有一种深厚的兄弟之情和朋友之谊的缘故。的确，还有比两个战士之间的友谊更亲密的友谊吗？没有，再没有比这更为亲密或牢固的友谊了！而这就是为什么我们两国人民之间的友谊这么强烈的原因。
    苏加诺说，印度尼西亚人民心里抚育着自由、幸福、平等和和平的思想。在我们全国的生活中，这种思想在著名的原则“潘查希拉”（即“五基”）中得到具体的表现。但是，还有1955年4月在万隆亚非国家会议上宣布的另一个“潘查希拉”五项原则。后面这五项原则不仅为参加万隆会议的亚非国家所支持，而且为包括苏联在内的世界上许多国家所承认。今天，凡是珍惜和平并为争取和平和反对帝国主义、资本主义和殖民主义而斗争的人都承认这些原则。
    今天，和平共处的思想已普遍于全世界。它抓住了亿万人的心。这些思想会继续存在和发展，直到全世界都重建了和平，直到自由在全世界都取得了胜利，直到所有国家都开始互相尊重。和平共处的思想将不断地发展，将为愈来愈多的国家所接受。我要求全世界的男女都来为争取持久和平而共同努力和进行斗争。
