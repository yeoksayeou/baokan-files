    The Paper Industry Bureau Holds Economic Activity Analysis and Evaluation Meeting
    Finds Reasons for Failure to Complete Plan in First Half of Year

    (Our newspaper reports) Although the production level of the factories under the Paper Industry Bureau of the Ministry of Light Industry improved in the first half of the year compared with the same period last year, the bureau as a whole did not complete the state plan. The output task for the first half of the year was short by more than 3,100 tons. In particular, newsprint and No. 4 letterpress printing paper, which are urgently needed by society, were not completed according to plan, affecting the completion of the national paper output plan. In order to effectively learn from the lessons and promote the completion of the plan tasks in the second half of the year, the Paper Industry Bureau recently held an economic activity analysis and evaluation meeting for the first half of the year. The factory directors, party committee secretaries, and trade union chairmen who attended the meeting conducted an in-depth analysis of the plan implementation in the first half of the year and found that the main reasons for affecting the plan in the first half of the year were that the paper machine speed, operating rate, and finished product rate were not completed according to plan. The low finished product rate was the determining factor affecting the plan in the first half of the year and also the main problem that existed in all factories. The finished product rate is a comprehensive indicator of product quality. The main reason for the low finished product rate is quality fluctuation, and the most fundamental and common reason for quality fluctuation is the weakness of production technology work.

    In response to this situation, the meeting believed that it is necessary to strengthen production technology work, and all factories should establish a chief engineer system to form a technical leadership core. At the same time, it is also necessary to further carry out inter-factory competition and advanced producer movements. Factories should also help each other, learn from each other, and implement technical assistance. The meeting especially emphasized that it is necessary to rely on the Party, rely on the masses, and do enterprise management work.

    The meeting also believed that although increasing the paper machine speed is one of the main methods of increasing production, it is necessary to do a good job in other aspects at the same time, such as strengthening technical organization work, stabilizing quality, reducing accidents, increasing operating time, improving technical standards, and stabilizing production conditions, in order to reduce downtime. Otherwise, the positive factor of increasing paper machine speed will affect the completion of the plan due to the failure of other work to keep up.

    At the meeting, each factory widely exchanged advanced experiences through analysis and evaluation. For example, the technical management of Jilin Paper Mill, the strengthening of organizational leadership and the grasping of advanced work of Yingkou Paper Mill, the implementation of team accounting of Minfeng Paper Mill, the organization of competition among the same types of workers in Shixian Paper Mill, the "摸水平、订方案" (assessing level and setting plans) and summing up and promoting advanced experience of Zhongyuan Paper Mill, the safety work of Shandong Paper Mill, and the organization of office competitions of Factory 601.

    In addition, the factory director and trade union chairman of Shixian Paper Mill and Kaishantun Paper Mill also signed an "Agreement on Further Implementing the Friendship Competition Contract and Strengthening Technical Assistance" at the evaluation meeting.

    During the meeting, under the personal leadership of Sha Qianli, Minister of Light Industry, and Wang Xinyuan, Deputy Minister, self-criticism from the bottom up was carried out, democracy was fully promoted, and extensive opinions for improving work were put forward.

    During the meeting, detailed calculations were also made, and it was decided to take a number of emergency measures to strive to complete the annual production plan in the second half of the year.

    Finally, factories such as Yingkou, Minfeng, Jilin, and Shixian..., which had comprehensively and nearly comprehensively overfulfilled the state plan in the first half of the year, were rewarded at the meeting.

    造纸局举行经济活动分析和评比会议
    找出上半年没有完成计划的原因
    本报讯　轻工业部造纸工业管理局所属各厂，上半年生产水平虽然比去年同期有所提高，但是全局并没有完成国家计划，上半年产量任务还差三千一百多吨，尤其是社会迫切需要的新闻纸、四号凸版印刷纸没有完成计划，影响了全国纸张产量计划的完成。为了有效地吸取教训，推动下半年计划任务的完成，造纸工业管理局在最近举行了上半年经济活动分析、评比会议。到会的厂长、党委书记和工会主席对上半年计划执行情况深入地进行了分析，找出上半年影响计划的主要原因是抄造率、运转率、成品率都没有完成计划。而成品率低是影响上半年计划的决定因素，也是各厂普遍存在的主要问题。成品率是产品质量的综合指标，成品率低的主要原因是质量波动，而质量波动最根本最普遍的原因是生产技术工作薄弱。
    针对这种情况，会议认为必须加强生产技术工作，各厂都要建立总工程师制，形成技术领导核心。同时还要进一步开展厂际竞赛和先进生产者运动，厂际之间还要互相帮助，互相学习，实行技术互助。会议特别强调要依靠党、依靠群众、做企业管理工作。
  　会议还认为提高抄速虽然是增加生产的主要方法之一，但是必须同时做好其他方面的工作，如加强技术组织工作，稳定质量，减少事故，增加作业时间，改进技术标准，稳定生产条件，以减少断头时间等。否则，就会使提高抄速这一积极因素，由于其他工作跟不上而影响计划的完成。
    在会上，各厂通过分析、评比，广泛交流了先进经验。如吉林造纸厂的技术管理，营口造纸厂的加强组织领导和抓先进工作，民丰造纸厂的推行班组核算，石岘造纸厂的组织同工种竞赛，中元造纸厂的“摸水平、订方案”、总结推广先进经验，山东造纸厂的安全工作，六○一厂的组织科室竞赛等经验。
    此外如石岘造纸厂同开山屯造纸厂的厂长、工会主席在评比会议中还签订了“进一步贯彻友谊竞赛合同，加强技术互助的协议”。
    会议期间，在轻工业部长沙千里、副部长王新元等亲自主持下，开展了自下而上的批评，充分发扬了民主，广泛提出了改进工作的意见。
    会议期间还算了细账，决定采取若干紧急措施，争取在下半年完成全年生产计划。
    最后，营口、民丰、吉林、石岘……等在上半年全面和接近全面均衡超额完成国家计划的工厂，都在会上得到了奖励。
