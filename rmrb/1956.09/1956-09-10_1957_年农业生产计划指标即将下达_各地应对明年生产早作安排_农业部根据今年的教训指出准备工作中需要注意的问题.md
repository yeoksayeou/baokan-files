Xinhua News Agency, September 9th: The Ministry of Agriculture issued a "Notice on Actively Carrying Out Preparatory Work for Next Year's Production" to the agricultural departments of provinces, cities, and districts in August.

The notice stated that next year's agricultural production plan targets will soon be issued. Currently, all regions should vigorously strengthen field management of autumn crops, promptly carry out autumn harvesting and planting, and make early arrangements and preparations for next year's production.

The notice stated that in arranging grain production, when advocating the planting of high-yield crops, it should be adapted to local conditions. Under unsuitable conditions, generally advocating the planting of high-yield crops may instead turn them into low-yield crops, resulting in losses. The notice also pointed out the need to rationally arrange the proportion of planting areas for various crops to achieve comprehensive development of agricultural production, ensuring increased production of grain and cotton while also increasing production of soybeans and other cash crops.

The notice pointed out that the following preparations should be made this autumn and winter for next year's agricultural production: Guide cooperatives in properly handling autumn-sown seeds, also select and retain enough seeds for next year's sowing, and properly store these seeds. All regions should also conduct a general review of the results of improved variety promotion. Continue to promote improved varieties that are suitable for local conditions; those without certainty can be tested again, and should not be promoted hastily; improved varieties that are not suitable for local conditions should be stopped from being introduced. In terms of exploring fertilizer sources, in addition to developing animal husbandry to expand fertilizer sources, a large amount of wild plants should be collected in the autumn, and crop straws should be used to produce fertilizer. In the South, the green manure planting area should be expanded. Many places have a large amount of peat, which should be actively utilized.

In terms of building small-scale water conservancy projects, in addition to expanding the irrigated area of paddy fields, attention should also be paid to water conservancy construction for flood prevention, drainage of internal water, and transformation of low-lying areas. Regarding the promotion of improved agricultural tools, a positive and steady approach should be adopted. The experiences and lessons learned from this year's promotion of new-style agricultural tools should be summarized to maintain enthusiasm and eliminate blindness. In areas with heavy summer and autumn rainfall, special attention should be paid to the prevention and control of overwintering pests.

The notice requires all regions to formulate plans for developing animal husbandry and to help cooperatives solve the problem of supplying collective and member households with livestock feed. Currently, efforts should be focused on collecting straw and wild forage. Silage of corn stalks, sweet potato vines, and green grass should be promoted, and silage technology should be taught.

The notice requires agricultural departments in all regions to strive to restore production in disaster areas and solve the difficulties in production in disaster areas. Special attention should be paid to repairing embankments, blocking breaches, draining internal water, saving crops, and replanting late-autumn crops. The supply of winter wheat seeds should be resolved quickly to shorten next year's spring famine. The greatest efforts should be made to protect draught animals in disaster areas and strengthen the prevention and control of livestock diseases. Early arrangements should also be made for the draught animals needed in disaster areas next year.

The notice also requires agricultural departments in all regions to train technicians from technology extension stations and cooperative technology cadres during the winter, launching a mass movement to learn technology.

    1957年农业生产计划指标即将下达
    各地应对明年生产早作安排
    农业部根据今年的教训指出准备工作中需要注意的问题
    新华社9日讯　农业部8月向各省、市、区农业部门发出“关于积极进行明年生产准备工作的通知”。
    通知说，明年农业生产计划指标即将下达，目前各地应大力加强秋收作物的田间管理，及时作好秋收秋种，并对明年的生产早作安排和准备。
    通知说，在布置粮食生产方面，提倡种植高产作物时，应因地制宜，在条件不相宜的情况下，一般化地提倡种植高产物，反而会使高产作物成为低产作物，招致损失。通知还指出需要合理安排各种农作物播种面积的比例，要做到全面发展农业生产，既保证粮、棉增产，又增产大豆和其他经济作物。
    通知指出今年秋冬需要为明年农业生产作好下列准备工作：指导合作社作好秋播种子处理工作，也要选留足够明年播种用的种子，并保管好这批种子。各地还应该普遍检查一次推广良种的结果，对适合当地条件的良种就继续推广；没有把握的可再作试验，不要忙于推广，不适合当地条件的就应该停止引进。在挖掘肥源方面，除了发展畜牧业以扩大肥源外，要在秋季大量收集野生植物并利用农作物的秸秆造肥，南方要扩大绿肥种植面积。很多地方有大量草炭，应该积极利用。
    兴修小型水利方面，除扩大水田灌溉面积以外，还应当注意防涝、排泄内水和改造低洼地的水利建设；在推广改良农具方面，应采取积极而稳步的态度，要总结今年推广新式农具的经验教训，以保持积极性，去掉盲目性。在夏秋雨水多的地区，要特别加强对越冬虫害的防治工作。
    通知要求各地制定发展畜牧业的计划，帮助合作社解决集体的和社员家庭对畜牧饲料的供应问题。目前应抓紧收集秸秆和野生饲草。提倡青贮玉米秸、红薯秧和青草，并传授青贮技术。
    通知要求各地农业部门努力恢复灾区生产，解决灾区生产中的困难。要特别抓紧复堤堵口、排除内水，挽救庄稼，补种晚秋作物。迅速解决冬麦种子的供应问题，以缩短明年春荒。要用最大力量把灾区耕畜保护下来，加强防治牲畜疫病工作。对明年灾区所需耕畜，也早作安排。
    通知还要求各地农业部门在冬季训练技术推广站的和合作社的技术干部，掀起一个群众性的学习技术的运动。
