Thoughts on Reading the Newspaper
　　Song Ruo

　　"Seizure"

　　Prime Minister Eden said that Egypt's "seizure" of the Suez Canal was an act of robbery.

　　President Nasser said: "The West says we seized the canal. But in fact, the canal was once taken from the Egyptian people, and now it has returned to the embrace of its rightful owner."

　　What is seized belongs to others, is an act of robbery, and is illegal; what is taken away is one's own, and returning to the embrace of its rightful owner is not only legal but also reasonable.

　　"Seizure" and "returning to the embrace of its rightful owner" reflect a major issue: to whom does the Suez Canal truly belong?

　　A river within a country's borders can only have one owner. The Suez Canal flows through Egyptian territory, and it can only belong to Egypt. Britain is good at saying that the Egyptians seized the Suez Canal, but the fact is that the Suez Canal is Egyptian property, just as the Thames River is British property. Prime Minister Eden's conclusion is based on completely false facts. Therefore, the fair ruling is that Mr. Eden is wrong.

　　"A Matter of Life and Death"

　　Prime Minister Eden said, "About half of the oil essential to the industrial activities of our country (Britain), Western Europe, Scandinavia, and many other countries passes through this canal today. This is a matter of life and death for all of us."

　　More than twenty years ago, Japanese militarists clamored that Northeast China and North China were Japan's "lifeline." And the Japanese militarists did advance along this "lifeline." But what was the result? The result is already known to everyone and need not be repeated.

　　Of course, the Suez Canal itself is still a waterway that facilitates free navigation for all countries. But the Egyptian government has announced that it guarantees freedom of navigation in the Suez Canal for all countries in the world.

　　Prime Minister Eden should have no objections. But he still insists on his "matter of life and death." In fact, if we expose it, the so-called "matter of life and death" is nothing more than colonialism!

　　"Record"

　　Prime Minister Eden said that he cannot believe Egyptian President Nasser's guarantee of freedom of navigation in the canal, because President Nasser's record proves that he is not a person to be trusted, and so on.

　　Whether it is an individual or a government, it is good to verify words and deeds (historical and current) based on the record. For example, some people say that from 1882 to 1922, Britain made sixty-six promises to withdraw troops from Egypt. Prime Minister Eden can completely check the British Foreign Office archives to see if there are more or fewer times, etc.

　　Prime Minister Eden did not give any examples of situations where free navigation of the Suez Canal is currently impossible. In fact, the current record is the opposite of what Eden said.

　　Panamanian Flag

　　Panamanian Ambassador Vallarino expressed dissatisfaction that Panama was not invited to the London Conference. Dulles explained to him that the basis for being invited was that a country must have more than two million tons of ships. Vallarino pointed out that Panama had more than three million tons. Dulles then said that these ships are actually mostly owned by the United States, but they simply fly the Panamanian flag.

　　The flag is Panamanian, the ships are American; in Dulles's view, the Panamanian flag is merely a decoration on American ships.

　　Flags are so sacred and dignified to the people of all countries, but in the eyes of Wall Street, the flags of other countries can be arbitrarily trampled upon. When it is useful, the United States arbitrarily takes it and uses it. When it is not needed, it puts on a stern face and says, "Get out of here, can the Panamanian flag represent Panama?!"

　　Stevenson's "Twist"

　　Stevenson said: The United States must take action to stop communism, "must launch various new plans to meet the challenge of the great social revolution that is sweeping the world, and twist the fierce forces of reform towards freedom."

　　We do not know what the "forces of reform" refer to, nor what their content is. However, twisting them "towards freedom," or twisting them towards the "free world," must be a good thing in Stevenson's view. It is one of the magic weapons to save the Republican government's "mess" abroad.

　　"Twisting" is indeed a simple and straightforward thing. Twisting it according to the twister's intentions to their heart's content, twisting it once and all is well, that would be truly satisfying!

　　In fact, "twisting" is by no means Mr. Stevenson's invention. In recent years, the United States has indeed relied on manipulating an invisible "twist" in the United Nations General Assembly to twist out several successful events, such as obstructing our country's admission to the United Nations, etc. No wonder Stevenson yearns for "twisting." In meetings, relying on "reprimands," "threats," "flattery," etc., "twisting" can indeed achieve temporary results. Unfortunately, good times do not last long. In the United Nations General Assembly, this wonderful twist has recently become somewhat ineffective. But Mr. Stevenson is not discouraged. He wants to use "twisting" outside the meeting. This is an amazing creation, and it probably requires someone with superhuman courage to manipulate.

　　We wish Mr. Stevenson good luck in entering the White House this November, and we will wait and see Stevenson's "twist."

    “夺取”
    艾登首相说，埃及“夺取”苏彝士运河是一种抢劫行为。
    纳赛尔总统说：“西方说，我们夺取了运河。而实际上，运河从前被人从埃及人民手中夺走，现在回到了它的合法主人的怀抱”。
    夺取的东西是别人的，是抢劫行为，是非法的；被夺走的东西是自己的，重新回到合法的主人的怀抱不但合法，而且合情合理。
    “夺取”和“回到合法主人的怀抱”反映了一个重大问题：苏彝士运河究竟谁属。
    在一国境内的河流，只能有一个主人。苏彝士运河在埃及的领土上流过，它只能是属于埃及的。英国善于说，埃及人夺取了苏彝士运河，但事实是苏彝士运河是埃及的财产，正如泰晤士河是英国的财产一样。艾登首相的结论是建筑在完全错误的事实基础上的。因此，公正的裁决是，艾登先生错了。
        “生死问题”
    艾登首相说，“今天通过这条运河的，大概有我国（英国）、西欧、斯堪的纳维亚和其他许多国家的工业活动所不可缺少的石油量的一半。这对我们全体是一个生死问题”。
    二十多年以前，日本军国主义者大声疾呼，东北和华北是日本的“生命线”。而日本军国主义者的确是沿着这条“生命线”前进的。但是结果怎么样呢？结果是大家都已知道了的，不用再赘言了。
    当然，苏彝士运河它本身还是一条便利各国通航自由的水道。但是埃及政府已宣布保证世界各国在苏彝士运河的通航自由。
    艾登首相本来是不应该有什么非议了。可是他还坚持他的“生死问题”。其实拆穿了，所谓“生死问题”，殖民主义而已，岂有他哉！
    “纪录”
    艾登首相说，他不能相信埃及总统纳赛尔关于运河通航自由的保证，因为纳赛尔总统的纪录证明他是一个不足以被人信任的人，等等。
    无论个人或政府，根据纪录对证一下言行（历史上的和当前的）是有好处的。比如有人说，从1882年到1922年英国关于从埃及撤军的诺言就有六十六次，艾登首相完全可以根据英国外交部的档案查对一下，多几次或者还少几次，等等。
    今天苏彝士运河不能自由通航的情况，艾登没有举出例子，其实眼前的记录是和艾登所说相反的。
    巴拿马国旗
    巴拿马大使瓦拉里诺对巴拿马没有被邀请出席伦敦会议表示不满。杜勒斯就这一点向他解释说，被邀请的基础是一个国家必须有二百万吨以上的船只。瓦拉里诺指出，巴拿马有三百多万吨。杜勒斯又说，这些船只实际上大部分是美国所有，只不过是悬挂巴拿马国旗罢了。
    国旗是巴拿马的，船只是美国的；在杜勒斯看来，巴拿马的国旗仅仅是美国轮船上的装饰品而已。
    国旗，对于各国人民来说是多么神圣和尊严呵，可是在华尔街看来，别国的国旗是可以任意糟蹋的。用得着的时候，美国便任意拿来用一用，用不着的时候便扳起脸来说，“去你的，巴拿马的国旗是不能代表巴拿马的？！”
    史蒂文森的“扭”
    史蒂文森说：美国必须行动起来制止共产主义，“必须发动各种新的计划来应付正在席卷世界的巨大的社会革命的挑战，把猛烈的改革力量扭向自由方面”。
      “改革力量”何所指，它的内容是什么，我们不得而知，不过把它“扭向自由方面”也好，扭向“自由世界”也好，在史蒂文森看来，一定是一件好事，是挽救共和党政府在外面搞得“一团糟”局面的法宝之一。
      “扭”确是一件简单干脆的事。按照扭者的意图遂心所欲而扭之，一扭而万事大吉，那真是称心如意的了！
    其实“扭”也绝不是史蒂文森先生的发明，近几年美国确曾靠在联合国大会里操纵一个无形的“扭”而扭出几当子得意的事儿，诸如阻挠接纳我国进入联合国等等。难怪史蒂文森向往于“扭”了。在会议中，靠着“喝叱”、“威胁”、“吹捧”等等，“扭”确也能收一时之效。无奈好景不常，在联合国大会上，这个奇妙的扭近来已经有些失灵了。但史蒂文森先生可并不灰心，他要在会外运用“扭”。这是惊人的创造，而且恐怕要具有超人魄力的人来操纵。
    预祝史蒂文森先生今年11月走进白宫，我们拭目以待，且看史蒂文森的“扭”。
