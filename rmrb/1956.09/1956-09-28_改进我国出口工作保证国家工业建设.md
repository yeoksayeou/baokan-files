Speech by Comrade Ye Jizhuang, Minister of Foreign Trade

I fully agree with Comrade Liu Shaoqi's political report, the new Party Constitution, Comrade Deng Xiaoping's report, the proposal for the Second Five-Year Plan, and Comrade Zhou Enlai's report.

I will now only discuss the situation and problems of China's foreign trade work from the perspective of exports.

Exports are intended to guarantee the import of complete sets of equipment and various important materials necessary for China's various constructions, primarily heavy industrial construction. However, the amount of exports must be determined according to needs and possibilities; we must not blindly export too much, nor should we export too little. If exports are too low, we cannot guarantee import needs, which will affect the progress of national industrialization, harm the long-term interests of the masses, and affect the further consolidation of the worker-peasant alliance in the future. If exports are too high, and as a result, difficulties arise in the supply of certain important commodities in the domestic market, failing to meet the immediate needs of the masses, it will cause dissatisfaction among the masses, thereby also affecting the smooth progress of national industrialization, the consolidation of the worker-peasant alliance, and the close ties between the Party and the people. Therefore, the amount of imports cannot be considered in isolation only from the needs of industrial construction, but must be considered comprehensively, weighing the importance and urgency of various factors such as national construction needs, import possibilities, financial situation, and the possibility of export supply. In addition, since China's current exports are mainly agricultural and sideline products, and many light industrial products for export also require agricultural products as raw materials, the bumper or poor harvest of agriculture has a significant impact on exports. Of course, agricultural harvests must also be taken into account when compiling the annual import and export plan.

Contradictions and shortcomings in import and export work

Inaccurate planning; insufficient reserve materials; one-sided management thinking; untimely price adjustments; the potential for increased production of export goods has not been fully utilized.

In recent years, under the correct leadership of the Central Committee and with the strong support of various departments, local Party and government at all levels, and the people of the whole country, we have been able to overcome difficulties, basically complete the export tasks, and ensure the foreign exchange needed for imports. However, there are still some contradictions and difficulties that need to be properly resolved. These contradictions and difficulties are mainly:

First, the import and export plans are not accurate enough, and there are too many and too large changes, which often cause great difficulties in foreign trade work. When there is a temporary surplus of some materials in the country, departments demand that foreign trade departments export them. For example, due to the reduction in agricultural production in 1954, which affected certain industrial production and fiscal revenue, and reduced capital construction, there was some surplus of several materials such as steel, cement, and pig iron in 1955. This was originally only a temporary false phenomenon, but the production departments, fearing stockpiling, repeatedly asked the foreign trade departments to find ways to sell them in large quantities to support domestic production. However, at the beginning of this year, when the upsurge of socialism came, these materials were reduced midway in the foreign export plans that had already been set due to the increased domestic demand. Also, when the supply of certain materials in the domestic market feels tight, or when there is a shortage in one place, the supply of export goods cannot be guaranteed. This will affect the implementation of foreign contracts and the country's foreign credibility, and thus affect the completion of the import plan. In addition, in recent years, because the export plan often cannot be issued together with the national economic plan, it cannot be included in the national economic plans of the provinces and cities, so the source of export goods cannot be effectively guaranteed.

Second, in recent years, when arranging or increasing import and export plans, the relevant government departments have considered import needs more, but have not considered export supply enough. Sometimes they approved supplementary imports, but there was no source for supplementary exports, which has caused certain difficulties in foreign payments.

Third, the planned development of the production of export goods has not been done well enough. The production of some agricultural and sideline products still lacks proper arrangements based on domestic and foreign needs; the development of some industrial and mineral products (such as iron sand, borax, crystal stone, salt, etc.) is still insufficient. Some export commodities, such as egg products, fruits, and aquatic products, require cold storage warehouses, refrigerated vehicles and ships, and fishing and processing equipment to ensure the planned expansion of exports. However, no due investment has been given in this regard.

The lack of comprehensive and realistic comprehensive balance and predictability in the national planning work is a major reason for the occurrence of the above difficulties and contradictions; the second reason is that the material reserves are too small and there is no room for maneuver. Of course, it is also wrong that the foreign trade department did not actively put forward opinions, or did not strive to solve the problem after putting forward opinions.

The foreign trade department also has many shortcomings and some mistakes in its work in this regard, mainly: (1) It has not worked hard enough to tap the potential of export goods, and there is a one-sided management thinking and style of only focusing on mainstream goods. (2) The adjustment of prices for certain exported agricultural and sideline products was not timely enough. In 1953, the erroneous measures of "maintaining production, lowering prices, and restricting purchases" were once adopted for the production of silk, tea, and casings. Although this error was quickly corrected, and the purchase prices of these products have been increased over the years, it still has a certain impact on the rapid increase in the production of these materials. At present, there are still phenomena of suppressing grades and prices in the purchase of goods in various places; often, when there are too many goods, they are not wanted, and when there are few, they are wanted very urgently. Although these phenomena are constantly being corrected, they still occur constantly. (3) After the implementation of joint state-private operation and store mergers of import and export firms, some enterprise organizations are too large, and the operation of goods is too complicated, so that they cannot fully exert their management expertise. In addition, it should also be mentioned that although the quality, specifications, and packaging of China's export commodities are generally good and have been praised by foreign users, some are not good enough and need to be improved.

Methods to improve export work

Improve the export plan; develop export goods; reasonably arrange domestic sales and foreign sales; strengthen procurement work; improve export specifications; give full play to the enthusiasm of import and export merchants and try to save foreign exchange

In order to solve the above contradictions and difficulties and improve China's foreign trade work, we believe that the following measures should be taken:

(1) When compiling annual and long-term plans, the state planning agencies should combine the import needs of various production and construction projects, the needs of the domestic market, and the possible supply of export goods, and comprehensively and realistically balance them, and base the import and export plans on an active and reliable basis, neither conservative nor rash. After the import and export plan is set, the export commodity supply plan should be included in the entire national economic plan, and production and procurement should be arranged to ensure supply. When adding an import plan, the export plan must be added accordingly to ensure the balance of foreign exchange revenue and expenditure. Unless absolutely necessary, the plan should not be changed easily, so as not to lose credibility to the outside world. After the implementation of the selective purchase and self-sale methods for some commodities, foreign trade units should be granted the right to sign contracts preferentially for export commodities, especially those that are in short supply and of high quality.

(2) To actively develop the production of export goods in a planned way is the most basic way to expand the source of export goods and ensure import needs. China has a large population and abundant resources, and the potential for increasing the production of export goods is great. Therefore, it is hoped that when formulating production plans for the development of agricultural and sideline industries and industrial and mining enterprises, export goods can be properly arranged according to the needs and possibilities of all parties. In order to increase the export of certain important commodities, such as borax, iron sand, crystal stone, salt, egg products, fruits, and aquatic products, the state should provide the necessary investment for the production and cold storage equipment of these materials separately.

(3) In order to meet the import needs required by the entire national economic plan, in the future, in general, we should still appropriately save the domestic consumption and supply of some materials for export within the possible scope, in exchange for the necessary imported materials. Under normal circumstances, except for materials that are of great importance to people's lives and national construction, such as grain, oil, steel, and certain important non-staple foods, which continue to be exported in limited quantities, other agricultural and sideline products and certain light industrial products that are not very important to the domestic supply should be exported as much as possible by saving domestic consumption; some commodities that are dispensable in domestic supply but have sales abroad should be exported first. After the plan is set, it should generally be guaranteed to supply according to the plan in order to maintain the country's foreign credit and ensure foreign exchange income. If there is indeed a national supply difficulty of certain important materials, which affects the lives of the broad masses, of course, it is also necessary to consider appropriately reducing exports, but it is better to report to the State Council for approval before revising the export plan.

(4) The foreign trade department and relevant procurement departments should conduct a comprehensive study of the prices of agricultural and sideline products and handicrafts, and appropriately increase those with low prices to stimulate the development of production. We must go deep into the producing areas, especially remote areas, organize a variety of export goods, strengthen the purchase of small local products, small foods, arts and crafts, and pay attention to organizing the export of small daily-use industrial products, and conscientiously correct the management thinking and style of simply focusing on mainstream goods.

(5) Gradually expand the export of industrial products and processed agricultural products, and improve the quality, specifications, and packaging of export commodities in accordance with the needs and preferences of foreign operators and consumers. Gradually establish national quality and specification standards for export products. Factories should stipulate quality indicators for production and establish product quality inspection institutions or equip specialized inspection technicians. The foreign trade department must cooperate with relevant production departments to gradually establish reputable export brands, so as to achieve excellent quality, suitable specifications, beautiful decoration, and solid packaging, and have scientific Chinese and foreign language instructions, so that foreign consumers like to use them.

(6) Give full play to the enthusiasm of joint state-private import and export merchants. To this end, the Ministry of Foreign Trade, in accordance with the spirit of the Central Committee's instructions, has appropriately subdivided the institutions of certain joint ventures in various ports according to commodity classification, restored some import and export firms, and appropriately adjusted and divided the division of labor between joint ventures and state-owned companies, in accordance with the principles of giving play to the management expertise of private import and export merchants, which is conducive to the development of business, and which is in line with the development direction of joint ventures (transition to public ownership in the future). For the restored small local products and special local products export firms, it is hoped that provinces and cities will allow them to go to the countryside for procurement, and local governments and supply and marketing cooperatives should provide them with convenience in their work. Because they are purchasing according to the plan stipulated by the state, and the materials purchased are all handed over to the state or exported for the state.

(7) In order to use foreign exchange to purchase major imported materials, everyone should try to save the use of foreign exchange. In general, things that can be produced domestically or have substitutes should not be ordered from abroad. Attention should also be paid to saving non-trade foreign exchange expenditures.

### 改进我国出口工作保证国家工业建设

    改进我国出口工作保证国家工业建设
    对外贸易部部长　叶季壮同志的发言
    我完全同意刘少奇同志的政治报告，新的党章和邓小平同志的报告，第二个五年计划建议和周恩来同志的报告。
    我现在只从出口方面来谈谈我国对外贸易工作的情况和问题。
    出口是为了保证我国各项建设首先是重工业建设所必需的成套设备和各种重要物资的进口。但是出口多少，必须按照需要和可能而定，不能盲目地出得过多，也不能出得太少。如果出口太少，就不能保证进口需要，那就会影响国家工业化的进度，就会损害群众的长远利益，影响今后工农联盟进一步的巩固。如果出口太多，因而引起国内市场上某些重要商品的供应发生困难，不能满足群众的眼前需要，就会引起群众不满，从而也会影响国家工业化的顺利进行、工农联盟的巩固以及党和人民群众的密切联系。因此，进口多少也就不能孤立地只从工业建设的需要去考虑，而必须按照国家建设需要、进口可能、财政情况、出口货源供应可能等各方面因素权衡轻重缓急加以综合平衡来考虑。此外，因为目前我国出口物资主要的还是农副产品，出口的许多轻工业品也需要用农产品作原料，因此农业的丰收或歉收对出口有很大影响，在编制年度进出口计划时当然也不能不考虑到农业的收成。
    进出口工作的矛盾和缺点
    计划工作欠准确；后备物资不充足；经营思想有片面性；价格调整不及时；出口物资的增产潜力还没有充分发挥
    几年来，在中央正确领导和各部门和各级地方党政以及全国人民大力支持下，使我们能够克服困难，基本上完成了出口任务和保证了进口的外汇需要。但是，还存在着一些矛盾和困难，需要加以妥善解决。这些矛盾和困难主要是：
    一、进口和出口计划不够准确，变动过多过大，往往造成对外贸易工作上很大的困难。有些物资国内一时稍多，便要求对外贸易部门出口。例如由于一九五四年农业的减产影响了某些工业生产和财政收入，削减了基本建设，因而一九五五年的钢材、水泥、生铁等几种物资有些剩余。这本来只是一时的虚假现象，但是生产部门怕积压，再三要求对外贸易部门设法大量外销，以支持国内生产。可是，到今年初当社会主义高潮来到之后，这些物资就因国内需要增大，又要把已经定了的对外出口计划中途削减。还有，某些物资遇着国内市场的供应感到紧张，一时或一地缺货时，往往会使出口货源的供应得不到保证。这样就会影响对外合同的执行和国家对外的信誉，因而也会影响进口计划的完成。此外，几年来由于出口计划常常不能随着国民经济计划一同下达，因而不能列入各省市的国民经济计划之内，以致出口货源得不到有力的保证。
    二、最近几年来，在安排或增加进出口计划时，政府有关部门考虑进口需要多，但是考虑出口供应不够，有时批准了补充进口，但补充出口的货源却没有着落，这就造成了对外支付上的一定困难。
    三、有计划地发展出口物资的生产还作得很不够。一部分农副业产品的生产还缺乏根据国内外需要进行妥善安排；一部分工矿产品（如铁砂、硼砂、水晶石、食盐等），还开发得很不够。一部分出口商品，如蛋品、水果、水产品等，需要冷藏仓库、冷藏车船和捕鱼加工设备，才能保证有计划的扩大出口。但是，在这方面却没有给以应有的投资。
    以上困难和矛盾的发生，国家计划工作上缺乏全面的切实的综合平衡和预见性，是一个主要原因；其次是物资后备打得太少没有回旋余地。当然，对外贸易部门没有积极提出意见，或者提了意见没有努力争取求得解决，也是不对的。
    对外贸易部门在这方面的工作中并且还有许多缺点和某些错误，主要是：（1）对发掘出口货源潜力还努力不够，存在着只抓大路货的片面的经营思想和作风。（2）对某些出口农、副产品的价格的调整不够及时，一九五三年还曾一度对蚕丝、茶叶、肠衣的生产采取了“维持生产、降低价格、限制收购”的错误措施，这个错误虽然很快就纠正了，并且历年都曾提高对这些产品的收购价格，但对这些物资的迅速增产仍然有一定影响。现在各地在收购进货中，还有压级压价现象；往往货物多了就不要了，少了又要的很急。这些现象，虽然不断在纠正，但还是不断发生。（3）进出口商行实行公私合营和并店之后，一部分企业机构过于庞大，经营商品过于繁杂，以致未能充分发挥他们的经营特长。此外，还应当提到我国出口商品的质量、规格、包装虽然一般是好的，曾得到国外用货者的称誉，但也有一些不够好，需要加以改进。
    改进出口工作办法
    改进出口计划；发展出口物资；合理安排内销和外销；加强采购工作；提高出口规格；发挥进出口商的积极作用和尽力节约外汇
    为了解决以上工作中的矛盾和困难，改进我国对外贸易工作，我们认为应当采取以下办法：
    （一）国家计划机关在编制年度和长期计划时，应当将各项生产建设的进口需要，国内市场的需要和出口货源的供应可能结合起来，全面地切实地予以综合平衡，把进出口计划打在既积极而又可靠的基础上，既不保守，也不冒进。进出口  计划既定之后，要将出口货源供应计划列入整个国民经济计划之内，并且布置生产、采购，保证供应。追加进口计划时，必须相应地追加出口计划，以保证外汇收支平衡。除非万不得已，不应当轻易变动计划，以免造成对外失信。实行一部分商品选购和自销办法之后，对于出口商品，特别是缺少的和优质的商品，要求给外贸单位以优先订立合同的权利。
    （二）有计划地积极发展出口物资的生产，这是扩大出口货源，保证进口需要的最基本的办法。我国人口众多，资源丰富，出口物资增产的潜力是很大的。因此，希望在制订发展农副业和工矿企业的生产计划时，能够根据各方面的需要和可能将出口物资予以妥善安排。为了增加某些重要商品的出口，如硼砂、铁砂、水晶石、食盐、蛋品、水果、水产品等，国家应分别对这些物资的生产和冷藏设备，予以必要的投资。
    （三）为了适应整个国民经济计划所要求的进口需要，今后一般的仍应在可能范围内适当节约国内一部分物资的消费供应出口，来换回必需的进口物资。在一般情况下，除对人民生活和国家建设关系重大的物资如粮食、油脂、钢材和某些重要副食品继续实行限量出口的办法外，其它对国内供应关系不很重要的农副产品和某些轻工业品，应当尽可能节约国内消费来供应出口；有些在国内供应上可有可无而国外又有销路的商品，应当尽先出口。在计划既定之后，一般的应当按计划保证供应，以维护国家对外信用和保证外汇收入。如果某些重要物资确实发生全国性的供应困难，影响到广大群众的生活时，当然也要考虑适当减少出口，但要先报告国务院批准，然后修改出口计划才好。
    （四）对外贸易部门和有关采购部门，对农副产品和手工艺品的价格应当进行全面研究，对其中价格确实低的应当适当提高，以刺激生产的发展。要深入产地特别是偏僻地区，组织多种多样的出口货源，加强收购小土产、小食品、工艺美术品，并且注意组织小型日用工业品的出口，认真纠正单纯地抓大路货的经营思想和作风。
    （五）逐步扩大工业品和农产加工品的出口，并且要按照国外经营者和消费者的需要和喜好来改进出口商品的品质、规格、包装。逐步建立出口产品的国家品质规格标准。工厂生产应当规定质量指标，并且设立产品质量检验机构或配备专责检验技术人员。对外贸易部门必须协同有关生产部门逐步建立有声誉的出口货牌号，做到品质优良、规格合适、装璜美观、包装坚固，并且有中外文科学说明，使国外消费者喜好乐用。
    （六）充分发挥公私合营进出口商的积极作用。为此，对外贸易部根据中央指示精神，已经根据发挥私营进出口商的经营特长、有利于开展业务和符合合营公司的发展方向（将来过渡到全民所有制）的原则，按照商品分类，将各口岸某些合营公司的机构适当分细，恢复一些进口和出口的商号，同时适当调整和划分合营和国营公司的分工。对于已恢复的小土产、特种土产出口商号，希望各省市允许他们到农村去采购，地方政府和供销合作社应当在工作上给他们以便利。因为他们是按照国家规定的计划去采购的，采购来的物资都是交给国家或者是替国家出口的。
    （七）为了把外汇用来购买主要的进口物资，大家都应尽量节约外汇的使用。凡国内能生产或有代用品的东西，一般的都不应向国外订货。对于非贸易的外汇支出，也要注意节约。
