Comrades!

On behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Australia and all its members, I extend warm fraternal greetings to the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China.

We, along with all progressive people in Australia, are very pleased to see that your great country, which was long in a state of backwardness due to the rule of imperialists, bureaucratic capitalists, and feudal elements, has made outstanding achievements in industrialization.

We are pleased to see you have achieved historically significant accomplishments in rapidly building a socialist society – the most advanced social system in human history.

The working class understands the great Chinese people's desire for peace.

The peace-loving forces in Australia warmly welcome the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence announced by Zhou Enlai and Mr. Nehru.

We are determined to fight for these principles – "Panchsheel" – and against the policies of the aggressive groups in our country.

The Australian people do not want a new war; they stand firmly with the Chinese people and all peace-loving people around the world, demanding peaceful consultations to resolve international problems.

The desire for peace is so strong that even the Australian government had to declare that it has no intention of participating in military intervention in the issue of Egypt's nationalization of the Suez Canal.

It can be stated definitively that various factions of the Australian labor movement support the establishment of diplomatic, economic, and cultural relations with the People's Republic of China. People from all walks of life in our country strongly support the restoration of China's legitimate status in the United Nations.

Zhou Enlai's proposal for the conclusion of a collective peace treaty for the Asian and Pacific region is of great significance to us, naturally, because Australia is part of this region.

However, reactionaries support the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, one of whose purposes is to interfere in the internal affairs of Asian and Pacific countries.

Because of this policy, Australian troops are stationed on the territory of Malaya. This has already aroused strong opposition. Not only Communists and militant trade unionists, but also the Labor Party, which has been in power many times, as well as progressive intellectuals, etc., are unanimously demanding the withdrawal of troops.

One of the most important characteristics of the Australian political situation is that the Labor Party has adopted a relatively progressive stance.

Therefore, the policies they have formulated advocate maintaining friendship and developing economic, cultural, and diplomatic relations with People's China, and oppose the reactionary policies dictated by the United States. Therefore, among the major factions of the broad labor movement, there has been a great increase in mutual understanding and the desire for unity.

The possibility of the Labor Party coming to power and implementing significant changes in policy is increasing. Dissatisfaction with the current government's foreign policy is growing. Dissatisfaction with the current government's failure to solve the worsening economic problems is also growing.

The Australian working people have noticed that international tensions have eased due to the actions taken by the socialist camp, led by the Soviet Union and People's China, and the efforts of peace forces around the world. We anticipate that peaceful coexistence and the democratic forces in our country will achieve new victories along with the changes taking place around the world.

Comrades, your brilliant achievements in laying the foundation for a socialist society have inspired our party. We have learned a lot from the practice of your party, especially in working with various allies. These, as well as the further development of Marxist-Leninist theory by the historically significant 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, are of utmost importance to our efforts to apply Marxism-Leninism to the specific conditions and traditions of Australia.

Let us forever be loyal to the great principles of proletarian internationalism.

Long live the friendship between the working people of China and Australia!

### 澳大利亚共产党代表团团长夏基同志致词

    澳大利亚共产党代表团团长夏基同志致词同志们！
    我代表澳大利亚共产党中央委员会和全体党员，向中国共产党第八次代表大会致热烈的兄弟的祝贺。
    我们和澳大利亚全体进步人士一起，很高兴地看到，过去由于帝国主义者、官僚资本家和封建分子的统治而长期处于落后状态的、你们的伟大的国家，在工业化方面取得了杰出的成就。
    我们很高兴地看到你们取得了具有世界历史意义的成就，在迅速地建设着社会主义社会——人类历史上最先进的社会制度。
    工人阶级了解伟大的中国人民爱好和平的愿望。
    澳大利亚爱好和平的力量热烈地欢迎周恩来和尼赫鲁先生所宣布的和平共处的五项原则。
    我们坚决地为这些原则——“潘查希拉”——而奋斗，反对我们国内侵略集团的政策。
    澳大利亚人民不希望有新的战争，他们坚定地同中国人民和全世界一切爱好和平的人士站在一起，要求用和平协商的办法解决国际问题。
    要求和平的情绪是这样强烈，以致澳大利亚政府也不得不声明，在埃及将苏伊士运河收归国有的问题上，它无意参加军事干涉的行动。
    可以确凿地说，澳大利亚劳工运动的各种派别，都赞成同中华人民共和国建立外交、经济和文化关系。我国各阶层人民都大力支持恢复中国在联合国的合法地位。
    周恩来提出的关于缔结亚洲和太平洋地区集体和平公约的建议，对我们是有重大意义的，这是很自然的，因为澳大利亚是这个地区的一部分。
    但是，反动分子却支持东南亚条约组织，这个组织的目的之一就是要干涉亚洲和太平洋国家的内政。
    由于这种政策，澳大利亚军队驻扎在马来亚的领土上。这已经引起了强烈的反对。不仅共产党人和战斗的工会工作者，而且曾多次执政的工党，以及进步的知识分子等等，都一致要求撤退军队。
    澳大利亚政治形势的一个最重要的特点，就是工党采取了比较进步的立场。
    因此，他们制定的政策，主张同人民中国保持友好和发展经济、文化、外交关系，反对美国所授意的反动政策。因此，在广泛的劳工运动的主要的派别中间，相互了解和要求团结的愿望有了很大的增长。
    工党上台执政和在政策上实行重要改变的可能性日益增加。对于现政府外交政策的不满情绪正在增长。对于现政府没有能够解决日益恶化的经济问题的不满情绪，也在增长。
    由于以苏联和人民中国为首的社会主义阵营所采取的行动，以及全世界和平力量的努力，国际紧张局势有了缓和，这一点澳大利亚劳动人民是注意到了的。我们预期，和平共处和我国的民主力量，将随着全世界正在发生的变化取得新的胜利。
    同志们，你们在奠定社会主义社会的基础方面取得了辉煌的成就，这使我们的党得到了鼓舞。我们从你们党的实践中，特别是在同各种同盟者共同工作方面，学到了很多东西。这些，以及苏联共产党具有历史意义的第二十次代表大会对马克思列宁主义理论的进一步发展，对于我们努力把马克思列宁主义运用于澳大利亚的具体情况和传统的工作具有极其重大的意义。
    让我们永远忠实于无产阶级国际主义的伟大原则。
    中国和澳大利亚劳动人民的友谊万岁！（附图片）
