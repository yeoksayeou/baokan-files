Xinhua News Agency, Jiamusi, 30th - The 16,000 hectares of wheat sown for the first time at the State-Run Friendship Farm were completely harvested by the 29th.

The wheat harvesting work at the State-Run Friendship Farm officially began on August 6th. During the harvest period, the area where the farm is located experienced a total rainfall of 89 millimeters, making the harvesting work very difficult in several hundred hectares of low-lying areas. In the worst places, the mud in the wheat fields was more than half a foot deep. However, the farm still managed to harvest the wheat from these fields.

Because more than 4,000 hectares of wheat harvested manually and in sections with windrowers are still being threshed, it is not yet possible to obtain a definitive figure for the overall average yield. Based on the area already harvested and threshed, and the yield, the average yield per hectare is 1.6 tons. It is estimated that the final definitive average yield will be around 1.5 tons, which could exceed the farm's original planned target of 1.433 tons per hectare. It should be noted that about 4,000 hectares of wheat on the farm lodged due to strong winds and rain during the yellow ripening stage, resulting in some losses. This not-so-low average yield was achieved under these circumstances. (Attached picture)

### 国营友谊农场的小麦收割完毕

    国营友谊农场的小麦收割完毕
    新华社佳木斯30日电　国营友谊农场第一次播种的一万六千公顷小麦，到29日已经收割完毕。
    国营友谊农场的小麦收割工作是8月6日正式开始的，在收割期间，由于农场所在的地区先后共降雨八十九公厘，有几百公顷低洼地，收割工作非常困难。在最坏的地方，麦田里的烂泥有半尺多深。但是农场仍然把这些地上的小麦收回来了。
    因为有四千多公顷用人工收割和割晒机分段收割的麦子正在脱谷，因此，目前还得不出总平均产量的肯定数字。根据已经收割并且脱谷过的面积和产量计算，每公顷的平均产量为一点六吨。估计最后的肯定平均产量在一点五吨左右，可以超过农场原订每公顷一点四三三吨的计划指标。应该说明，农场约有四千公顷小麦在黄熟期中，因为风雨大倒伏了，受到了一些损失，这个不算低的平均产量，是在这种情况下得到的。（附图片）
