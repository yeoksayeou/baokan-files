Letter of Greetings from the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party to the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China:

    The Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party extends warm and comradely congratulations to the historic Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China.

    In the dozen or so years since the Seventh Congress, the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, have accomplished great undertakings. Thanks to the collective leadership and creative application of Marxism-Leninism by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese revolution has achieved victory and is continuously achieving new successes in the path of transition to socialism in new and creative forms.

    The cause of the powerful Communist Party of China and the great Chinese people provides the progressive humanity of the world with infinite lessons and encouragement. It has not only brought happiness to the Chinese people but has also severely struck the imperialist colonial system, inspired the people of Asia and Africa who are fighting for national liberation, and made significant contributions to the cause of peace in Asia and the world, and to the progress of mankind.

    We are deeply convinced and sincerely expect that the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people, under the guidance of the various policies decided by this congress, will achieve even greater victories in socialist construction in both urban and rural areas.

    The Japanese people's movement for peace, independence, and democracy has gained strength from the victory of the Chinese people and drawn lessons from the Chinese revolution.

    The reactionary ruling class of Japan is colluding with American imperialism to expand its armaments. They are attempting to revive militarism, thus creating the danger of a renewed aggression against Asian countries.

    However, as the Japanese people gradually recognize the peaceful construction of the People's Republic of China and its friendly foreign policy based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, many Japanese people are increasingly determined to demand friendship with China and to demand that the Japanese government change its foreign policy.

    For the sake of Asian peace and the interests of the Japanese people, it is necessary to establish normal diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union and also to restore normal diplomatic relations with China, and to establish an unbreakable friendship between the two peoples.

    At present, when the American imperialists are turning Japan into the largest base for aggression against Asia, the establishment of friendly relations between Japan and the Soviet Union and China is of great significance for consolidating peace in Asia and establishing collective security in the Asia-Pacific region.

    The struggle of the Japanese people, led by the working class, against the rule of American imperialism and Japanese reactionaries, for peace and independence, for preventing the revival of militarism, and for expanding freedom and democracy, is developing. More than 33 million people have signed petitions against atomic and hydrogen bombs, and the World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs was successfully convened in Nagasaki this August. These facts fully demonstrate this.

    It is also reflected in the fact that in the July elections for the House of Councillors, the various democratic parties (Socialist Party, Communist Party, Labor-Farmer Party) obtained 42 percent of the total votes, thus thwarting the reactionary forces' malicious attempts to revise the Constitution and openly revive militarism.

    Since 1950, the Japanese Communist Party has been in a semi-legal state under the persecution of American imperialism and Japanese reactionary forces. However, since last year, the Party, supported by the increasingly high tide of mass struggles, has resumed open activities and is continuously overcoming its shortcomings and moving forward with new strides.

    In the recent House of Councillors elections, the number of votes received by the Party increased by nearly 30 percent compared with the House of Representatives elections last year. At the same time, through this election, the united struggle of democratic forces was developed in many regions. We are making our best efforts to expand and strengthen our Party, to make it a mature Marxist-Leninist party, a vanguard party of the people; to unite all democratic forces, and to consolidate a broad national liberation and democratic united front, in order to accomplish the Party's historical task of building a new, independent, peaceful, and democratic Japan.

    Now, our Party and many progressive people in our country are watching your Party's congress with deep concern and ardent anticipation. Since the establishment of the Communist Party of China and the Japanese Communist Party, in the arduous struggle against our two peoples' common enemy – imperialism – we, as fraternal parties, have shared difficulties and hardships and made great sacrifices. Therefore, we feel infinite joy that we are able to express our congratulations at this victorious congress of your Party

    Long live the victory of socialism in China!

    Long live the glorious Communist Party of China!

### 日本共产党中央委员会的贺信

    日本共产党中央委员会的贺信中国共产党第八次全国代表大会：
    日本共产党中央委员会向具有历史意义的中国共产党第八次代表大会致以热烈的同志的祝贺。
    在第七次代表大会以后的十几年里，中国人民在中国共产党的领导下完成了伟大的事业。由于以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党中央委员会实行了集体领导和创造性的运用了马克思列宁主义，中国革命从而取得了胜利，并且正以新的创造性的形式，在向社会主义过渡的道路上不断获得新的成就。
    强大的中国共产党和伟大的中国人民的事业，给世界进步人类以无限的教训和鼓励。它不仅给中国人民带来了幸福，还严重地打击了帝国主义殖民体系，鼓舞了为争取民族解放而斗争的亚非各国人民，对亚洲和世界的和平及人类的进步事业作出了重大贡献。
    我们深信并衷心期待着中国共产党和中国人民在这次大会决定的各项方针指导下，在城市和农村的社会主义建设中获得更大的胜利。
    日本人民争取和平、独立、民主的运动，从中国人民的胜利中获得了力量，从中国革命中吸取了教训。
    日本反动统治阶级正在勾结美帝国主义，扩充军备，他们企图复活军国主义，因而制造了再度侵略亚洲国家的危险。
    但是，由于日本人民逐渐认识了中华人民共和国的和平建设和以和平共处五项原则为基础的友好的对外政策，不少的日本人民日益坚决地要求与中国友好、要求日本政府改变对外政策。
    为了亚洲和平和日本人民的利益，必须同苏联建立正常的邦交，同时也必须同中国恢复正常的外交关系，在两国人民之间建立起牢不可破的友谊。
    目前，当美帝国主义者正在把日本变为侵略亚洲的最大基地的时候，日本同苏联和中国建立友好关系，对于巩固亚洲的和平，建立亚洲及太平洋地区的集体安全具有重大的意义。
    以工人阶级为首的日本人民为反对美帝国主义和日本反动派的统治、争取和平和独立；为制止军国主义复活、争取扩大自由和民主而进行的斗争正在向前发展。三千三百多万人签名反对原子弹氢弹，今年八月在长崎胜利地召开了反对原子弹氢弹世界大会。这些事实充分地说明了这一点。
    它还表现在：在今年七月的参议院选举中各民主政党（社会党、共产党、劳农党）获取了选票总数的百分之四十二，从而使反动派恶劣地修改宪法、公然恢复军国主义的企图未能得逞。
    一九五○年以来，日本共产党在美帝国主义和日本反动势力的迫害下，陷于半合法的状态。但是，从去年以来，党得到日益高涨的群众斗争的支持，重新开始了公开活动，并且不断地克服着党的缺点，以新的步伐前进。
    在最近的参议院选举中，党所得到的选票比去年众议院选举时增加了近百分之三十，同时还通过这次的选举，在许多地区发展了民主力量的联合斗争。我们正在尽最大的努力扩大和加强我们的党，使它成为一个成熟的马克思列宁主义的党、人民群众的先锋的党；团结一切民主力量，巩固广大的民族解放民主统一战线，以完成党所担负的建立一个独立、和平、民主的新日本的历史任务。
    现在，我们党以及我国许多进步的人们都以深切的关怀和热烈的期待注视着你们党的这次大会。中国共产党和日本共产党建党以来，在对我们两国人民的共同敌人——帝国主义进行的艰苦斗争中，我们作为一个兄弟党，也分尝了艰难和困苦，付出了很大的牺牲。因此，我们能够在你们党的这次胜利的大会上表达我们的祝贺，这使我们党感到无限的喜悦。
    社会主义在中国的胜利万岁！
    光荣的中国共产党万岁！
    马克思列宁主义的胜利万岁！
    日中两国人民牢不可破的友谊万岁！
    亚洲和世界和平万岁！
                日本共产党中央委员会
                一九五六年九月十六日
