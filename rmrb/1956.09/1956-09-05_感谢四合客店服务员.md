    Thanks to the Staff of the Sihe Hotel

    Around 12 o'clock midnight on August 17th, I passed through Gunzhou and stayed overnight at the Sihe Hotel. As soon as I settled in, a staff member of the hotel came to ask me: "Do you need me to buy a bus ticket for you?" Having to travel further, buying a bus ticket was my biggest concern. I gave him the money. In less than half an hour, he returned with the ticket and the remaining money. "How much is the service charge?" I asked him happily. He waved his hand and said, "We don't need any money. It's our duty to buy tickets for passengers so they can rest." That night, although I went to bed late, and had to catch a bus early the next morning, I still slept sweetly for five and a half hours. I am very grateful to the hotel staff for their help.

    感谢四合客店服务员
    8月17日深夜十二点多，我路过衮州，在四合客店宿夜。刚住下，客店的服务员就来问我：“需要我替你买汽车票么？”还要赶路，买汽车票是我最关心的一件事。我把钱交给他。没半小时，他就把车票和剩余的钱交给我。“多少手续费？”我高兴地问他。他摆摆手说：“一个钱也不要。只要旅客能得到休息，买车票是我们应该做的事。”那夜，我虽睡得很晚，第二天一早又去赶车，但还甜蜜地睡了五个半小时。我很感谢客店服务员给我的帮助。
