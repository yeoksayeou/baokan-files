Xinhua News Agency report: Liaoning Province will generally have a bumper harvest of various pears this year. According to a survey of five counties—Jianchang, Suizhong, Yixian, Beizhen, and Chaoyang—the total output is expected to reach more than 62,000 tons, exceeding the planned output by nearly 20%.

Liaoning Province is one of the major pear-producing provinces in the country. This year, it will not only expand the supply to the domestic market but also increase exports.

Xinhua News Agency report: Liaoning Province, known for apple production, expects its total apple production this year to exceed last year's actual output by 158,000 tons. Currently, Hongyu apples are being harvested and are entering the market.

Liaoning Province is a famous apple-producing region in China. In the past, its total apple production accounted for more than 80% of the country's total output.

This spring, during the flowering and fruit-setting period of the apples, the temperature was low, and pollination was not good; there was also a serious outbreak of codling moth infestation. However, thanks to the timely organization of members by the local fruit tree production cooperatives to carry out vigorous disaster resistance and pest control work, the extent of the disaster was greatly reduced.

It is estimated that the number of apples meeting export standards this year will be slightly less than last year, but the supply of apples to the domestic market will be more than in previous years.

This newspaper reports: Farmers in some mountainous areas of Guangdong Province are actively expanding the pineapple planting area. Since the beginning of autumn, farmers in Hainan Island, Leizhou Peninsula, and FanYu, Zhongshan and other counties, where pineapples are abundant, have planted more than 700,000 pineapple plants on newly reclaimed wasteland. The pineapples planted by the farmers in the old revolutionary base area of ​​Danan Mountain in Puning County are better and more plentiful than in previous years.

This summer, more than 170,000 mu of pineapples in the province had an unprecedented bumper harvest, with a total output of 650,000 dan, an increase of about 30% over last year. In order to encourage farmers to grow more pineapples, the Guangdong Provincial People's Committee recently adjusted the price of pineapples, increasing it from the original 7.83 yuan per dan to 8.15 yuan. The provincial agricultural department has also decided to strengthen guidance on cultivation techniques and actively promote the excellent varieties "Sarawak" and "Bali" to improve pineapple quality.

    辽宁苹果可增产十五万吨  广东菠萝比去年多产三成
    据新华社讯　辽宁省今年各种梨将普遍获得大丰收。据建昌、绥中、义县、北镇、朝阳等五个县调查，预计总产量可达到六万二千多吨，超过计划产量近20％。
    辽宁省是全国产梨主要省份之一。今年不但扩大了对国内市场的供应，出口量也将增加。

    据新华社讯　盛产苹果的辽宁省，预计今年苹果总产量可超过去年实产量十五万八千吨。目前，红玉苹果已经普遍采摘，开始上市。
    辽宁省是我国著名的苹果产区，苹果总产量过去历年都占全国总产量80％以上。
  今春，正当苹果开花著果期间，气温较低，授粉不好；又发生了严重的食心虫灾害，但由于各地果树生产合作社及时组织社员进行大力抗灾和防虫工作，致使受灾程度大为减轻。
    今年合乎出口规格的苹果，估计将比去年略微减少，但供应国内市场的苹果却比往年增多。
                ☆
    本报讯　广东省部分靠近山区的农民，积极扩大菠萝种植面积。立秋以后，盛产菠萝的海南岛、雷州半岛和番禺、中山等县农民在新垦的荒地上，种下菠萝七十多万株。普宁县大南山老革命根据地的农民种的菠萝，比往年又多又好。
    今年夏季，全省十七万多亩菠萝曾经获得空前的丰收，总产量达到六十五万担，比去年增产三成左右。为了鼓励农民多种菠萝，最近，广东省人民委员会调整了菠萝的价格，从原来每市担七点八三元提高到八点一五元。省农业部门也决定加强栽培技术的指导，积极推广优良品种“沙拉瓦”和“巴里”种，以改善菠萝质量。（李少球）
