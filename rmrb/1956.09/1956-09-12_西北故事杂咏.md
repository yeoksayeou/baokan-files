    Miscellaneous Poems on Northwest Stories
  　Feng Zhi
    Old Lord Temple in Yumen
    In the past, some poor people,
    Mined gold for the wealthy in the mountains,
    They prayed for the blessings of the gods,
    And built a small temple, dedicated to Lao Jun.
    The Old Lord Temple crouched in the barren mountains,
    Silent for hundreds of years,
    But it has come to this day,
    And suddenly became world-famous.
    How did it become world-famous?
    Because the descendants of the poor people
    No longer mine gold for the wealthy,
    But build a great oil city.
    Du Fu
    In a teahouse in Fuxian, I met an old man,
    He said, five miles south of the city is General Terrace;
    One day, Du Fu's student came to find Du Fu,
    But did not find Du Fu's residence,
    He went to General Terrace and turned back—
    In fact, Du Fu's home was sixty miles west of the terrace.
    Beside the Du Fu River in Yan'an, I met a farmer,
    He said, Du Fu walked along this small river,
    He walked into the western mountains,
    His trail could no longer be found in the mountains.
    He only left a pair of shoes by the river,
    People preserved these shoes for many years.
    I had no intention of seeking out Du Fu's stories,
    But the stories are naturally on the people's lips,
    Like some beautiful wildflowers and weeds,
    Naturally growing in the mountains for hundreds of years—
    The stories are so half-true and half-false,
    But they show how deeply the poet is in people's hearts.
    Crying Spring in Yijun County
    Along our Great Wall,
    How many temples of Meng Jiangnu have there been?
    How many tombs of Meng Jiangnu have there been?
    In our vast land,
    How many legends of Meng Jiangnu have there been?
    How many songs of Meng Jiangnu have there been?
    How is it that there is also a Jiangnu Temple here,
    Far away from the Great Wall?
    Only because there is a legend of Meng Jiangnu
    Surrounding this clear spring.
    Legend says she passed by here,
    Carrying her husband's bones on her back,
    Without eating or drinking along the way,
    Extremely thirsty, she cried bitterly by the roadside.
    At the moment when she cried the most bitterly,
    A wisp of clear spring gushed out by the roadside.
    People call this spring the Crying Spring,
    And built a temple for her above the spring.
    This was the fate of the people in the past,
    Even not near the Great Wall,
    There would be Meng Jiangnu's temples and tombs.
    This was the fate of the people in the past,
    So in our land,
    Everywhere there are her legends and songs.
        ＊　＊　＊
    Now how many young men and women,
    Are creating miracles inside and outside the Great Wall:
    Digging out water sources where there is no water,
    Building prosperous cities on the wasteland.
    Their songs resound through the clouds,
    Their drills penetrate deep into the earth;
    They will no longer recognize a mound as Jiangnu's tomb,
    They will no longer say a clear spring is Jiangnu's tears.
    The people have taken control of their own destiny,
    And will no longer hear Meng Jiangnu's cries;
    The Crying Spring also seems to be making a request:
    "I want to change my name!"

    西北故事杂咏
  　冯至
    玉门老君庙
    从前有些穷苦的人，
    在山里给阔人淘金，
    他们求神灵的保佑，
    盖一座小庙，供奉老君。
    老君庙蹲在荒山里，
    几百年无声无息，
    可是它到了今天，
    忽然间闻名全世。
    它怎么会全世闻名？
    只因穷苦人的子孙
    不再给阔人淘金，
    却建设伟大的石油城。
    杜甫
    鄜县茶馆里遇见一个老汉，
    他说，城南五里有座将军台；
    一天，杜甫的学生来找杜甫，
    却没有找到杜甫的住宅，
    他到了将军台就转了回去——
    其实杜甫的家在台西六十里。
    延安杜甫川旁遇见一个农夫，
    他说，杜甫就沿着这条小河走去，
    他走入西方的万山丛中，
    万山中再也找不到他的踪迹。
    他只把一双鞋丢在河边，
    人们保存这双鞋，保存许多年。
    我无心访求杜甫的故事，
    故事却自然地在人民的口边，
    像一些美丽的野花野草，
    千百年自然地生长在山间——
    故事是这样地半假半真，
    却说明诗人是怎样深入人心。
    宜君县哭泉
    沿着我们的万里长城，
    有过多少孟姜女的祠庙？
    有过几座孟姜女的坟茔？
    在我们广大的土地，
    有过多少孟姜女的传说？
    有过多少孟姜女的歌曲？
    这里怎么也有一座姜女庙，
    这里离长城还很辽远？
    只因有一段孟姜女的传说
    围绕着这里的一口清泉。
    传说她从这里走过，
    背上背着丈夫的骸骨，
    一路上没有吃，没有喝，
    渴极了，她在路旁痛哭。
    她哭到最痛的时刻，
    路旁涌出来清泉一缕。
    人们把这泉叫作哭泉，
    泉上给她盖了一座庙宇。
    这是过去的人民的命运，
    甚至不是在长城的附近，
    也会有孟姜女的庙和坟。
    这是过去的人民的命运，
    所以在我们的土地，
    到处有她的传说和歌曲。
        ＊　＊　＊
    如今有多少青年男女，
    他们在长城内外创造奇迹：
    在没有水的地方挖出水源，
    在荒原上建筑繁荣的城市。
    他们的歌声响彻云霄，
    他们的钻机深入地内；
    不会再把一座土丘认成姜女的坟，
    不会再把一口清泉说成姜女的泪。
    人民掌握了自己的命运，
    再也听不见孟姜女的哭声；
    哭泉也好像提出了要求：
    “我要改变我的名称！”
