Small Lens

"Tireless Selection"
　　In a small stall selling sesame cakes in a certain town in Zhejiang Province, there is a slogan written in large red characters: "Answer two questions for every one asked, take three for every one wanted, tireless selection, guaranteed customer satisfaction."
　　A customer asked: "Sesame cake and fried dough stick stalls also implement 'take three for every one wanted, tireless selection,' how can you guarantee hygiene?"
　　"This is a service agreement arranged by the cadres after the climax of the socialist transformation in the town. No matter what kind of stall you are, you have to copy it and post it." The stall owner said with an embarrassed smile. Gao Fuxiao

Not Betraying Oneself
　　Child: Dad, the teacher was talking about me today. The teacher said: "Being late is already wrong, why do you have to lie? You are such a small child, who taught you to make up such a big pack of lies?"
　　Dad: You must never say that I taught you! Yao Yuxia

    “百挑不厌”
    浙江省某城镇一个卖大饼的小摊上，摆着一张红纸大字的标语：“问一答二，要一拿三，百挑不厌，保证顾客满意”。
    顾客问：“大饼油条摊也实行‘要一拿三、百挑不厌’，怎样保证卫生呢？”
     “这是镇上社会主义改造高潮来后，干部布置下来的服务公约，不问你是什么摊子，都得把它抄了贴起来”。摊主人不好意思地苦笑着说。　高扶小
