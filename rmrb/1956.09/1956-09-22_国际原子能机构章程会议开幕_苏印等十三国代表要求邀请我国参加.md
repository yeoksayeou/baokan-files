    International Atomic Energy Agency Statute Conference Opens
    Representatives from 13 Countries including the Soviet Union and India Request Invitation for China to Participate
    Xinhua News Agency, 21st, New York Dispatch: The conference to discuss and approve the Statute of the International Atomic Energy Agency, attended by eighty-five countries, opened on September 20th at the United Nations building. Representatives from thirteen countries including the Soviet Union and India requested at the meeting that the People's Republic of China be invited to send representatives to participate in the conference.
    Soviet representative Tsarapkin spoke first, requesting that China be invited to send representatives to participate in the conference. He said that excluding six hundred million people created an "intolerable situation" and that the People's Republic of China was "a powerful factor in maintaining peace." He demanded that the "true representatives of the Chinese people" participate in the conference.
    Indian representative Bhabha immediately supported the Soviet proposal, expressing "deep regret" that the true representatives of China were unable to participate in the conference. He said that the conference could not ignore the existence of a quarter of the world's population and that without China's participation, the conference could only proceed without the benefit of China's views and resources.
    Indonesian representative Zondero Nigoro said that the activities of the International Atomic Energy Agency could only succeed as an activity of worldwide peaceful cooperation, which meant that no country should be excluded from participating in this cooperation.
    Syrian representative Mufti and Ceylon representative Gunawardene also spoke in favor of inviting China to participate in the conference.
    Other countries that agreed to invite China to participate included: Afghanistan, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Ukraine, and Belarus.
    Representatives from Paraguay, South Korea, and South Vietnam spoke out against the invitation.
    Simultaneous with the opening of the conference, an exhibition on the peaceful uses of atomic energy was held inside the United Nations building, featuring a model of the world's first nuclear power plant, which began generating electricity in the Soviet Union in 1954, as a gift from the Soviet government to the United Nations.
    This conference was convened at the invitation of the twelve countries that participated in the June meeting to draft the statute of the international agency for the peaceful uses of atomic energy.

    国际原子能机构章程会议开幕
    苏印等十三国代表要求邀请我国参加
    新华社21日讯　纽约消息：八十五个国家参加的讨论和批准国际原子能机构章程会议，9月20日在联合国大厦开幕。苏联、印度等十三国代表在会上要求邀请中华人民共和国派代表参加会议。
    苏联代表查鲁宾首先发言要求邀请中国派代表参加会议。他说，把六亿人民拒于门外造成了“令人不能容忍的形势”，中华人民共和国是“维护和平的一个强大的因素”。他要求让“中国人民的真正代表”参加会议。
    印度代表巴巴立即支持苏联的主张，他对中国的真正代表未能参加会议“深表遗憾”。他说，会议不能无视世界四分之一人口的存在，没有中国的参加，会议就只能在得不到中国的观点和中国资源的助益的情况下进行工作。
    印度尼西亚代表宗德罗尼哥罗说，国际原子能机构的活动只有作为世界范围的和平合作的活动才能成功，这就是说，必须不排斥任何国家参加这种合作。
    叙利亚代表穆弗提和锡兰代表古纳瓦地尼也都发言主张邀请中国参加会议。
    其他赞成邀请中国参加的有：阿富汗、南斯拉夫、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、波兰、罗马尼亚、乌克兰和白俄罗斯。
    巴拉圭、南朝鲜、南越等国代表发言表示反对。
    和会议开幕的同时，在联合国大厦内还举办了一个和平利用原子能展览会，展览会上展出了苏联政府赠送给联合国的礼物——1954年在苏联开始发电的世界第一个原子能电站的模型。
    这次会议是由参加今年6月的草拟和平利用原子能国际机构章程会议的十二个国家邀请召开的。
