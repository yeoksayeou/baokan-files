Xinhua News Agency Dispatch:

    Harbin city has thirty-six factories which, while engaging in flood prevention and production simultaneously, exceeded their output or output value plans for August.

    These thirty-six factories include major enterprises such as the Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tools Factory, the Harbin Flax Textile Mill, the Harbin Electric Wire Factory, and the Harbin No. 2 Tool Factory.

    In August, the Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tools Factory transferred workers to participate in five flood prevention and earth-filling tasks. By the middle of the month, 10% of the production tasks had not been completed. After discovering this situation, the workers voluntarily canceled one Sunday of rest, with some workers persisting in production at the factory, and others going to flood prevention, finally completing the August production tasks on schedule. During the flood prevention period, the Harbin Electric Wire Factory experienced a shortage of some raw materials. The factory leadership promptly modified the originally planned production specifications, first producing products with available inventory of raw materials, and completed the August production plan two days ahead of schedule. Workers at the Harbin Cement Plant, which was once surrounded by floods and engaged in round-the-clock intense flood prevention while persisting in production, actively improved operating techniques, increasing the hourly output of each cement kiln from 29 tons to 30.5 tons, completing the entire month's cement output plan.

    哈尔滨三十六个工厂
    在防汛中超额完成计划
    据新华社讯　哈尔滨市有三十六个工厂，在一边防汛一边生产的情况下，超额完成了8月份的产量或产值计划。
    这三十六个工厂包括哈尔滨量具刃具厂、哈尔滨亚麻纺织厂、哈尔滨电线厂、哈尔滨第二工具厂等主要企业。
    哈尔滨量具刃具厂在8月份抽调职工参加了五次防汛装土工作，到中旬有10％的生产任务没有完成。职工们发现这个情况以后，自愿取消了一个星期日的休息，一部分职工坚持在厂生产，一部分职工前往防汛，终于使8月份的生产任务按期完成了。哈尔滨电线厂在防汛期间，有一部分原料供应不上，厂的领导方面及时修改了原订的生产规格，先作有库存原料的产品，提前两天完成了8月份的生产计划。曾经被洪水包围，日夜紧张防汛又坚持生产的哈尔滨水泥厂的工人，由于积极改进操作技术，使每台水泥窑每时产量从二十九吨提高到三十点五吨，完成了全月的水泥产量计划。
