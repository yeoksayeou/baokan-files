    The Great Historical Significance of the Chinese Communist Party's Congress
    -- Pravda Editorial, September 29th
    The Eighth National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party concluded in Beijing on September 27th.
    The Chinese Communist Party Congress is a major event in the domestic life of China, a nation with a population of six hundred million, as well as in the life of the entire international communist and worker movement.
    The Congress summarized the enormous work completed since the Seventh National Congress in April 1945, adopted the Party's constitution, and approved the proposals regarding the Second Five-Year Plan.
    The resolution on the political report of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, unanimously adopted by the Eighth National Congress, stated: "After discussing the political report made by Comrade Liu Shaoqi on behalf of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Eighth National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party believes that the political line adopted by the Central Committee since the Seventh National Congress is correct and decides to approve this report."
    In the past eleven years, China has thoroughly completed the bourgeois democratic revolution and achieved a decisive victory in the socialist revolution. The Congress pointed out that China has ended the system of class exploitation and established a socialist social system.
    After the victory of the great people's revolution, the founding of the People's Republic of China opened a new era in the lives of the Chinese people. This historically significant victory is the most prominent event after the Great October Revolution, and it has had a tremendous impact on the development of the liberation struggle of Eastern countries and the entire course of world history.
    In a short period after the victory of the socialist revolution, the Chinese people, under the leadership of the glorious Communist Party, completed great democratic reforms, restored the national economy, and are now steadfastly advancing along the road of socialist construction, successfully overcoming various difficulties on this glorious path.
    The Eighth National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party determined the new tasks of the Chinese people in the struggle for socialism. The Chinese Communist Party is victoriously implementing its general line according to China's specific circumstances in order to gradually realize the socialist industrialization of the country and the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce. Following the Party's general line, the Chinese people began implementing the first five-year plan for the development of the national economy in 1953. During this period, decisive victories were achieved in the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce. The rapid development of socialist economic components has created a more solid foundation for the country's socialist industrialization. During the first five-year plan, approximately five hundred large industrial projects will be put into production, which will become the base for the further development of the country's industry.
    The proposals for the Second Five-Year Plan adopted by the Congress are a great program for the struggle for socialism. The political report made by the Central Committee to the Congress pointed out that the basic task of the Second Five-Year Plan is to continue to prioritize the development of heavy industry, focusing on the technological transformation of the national economy, to establish a solid foundation for the country's socialist industrialization, to thoroughly complete socialist transformation, to strengthen national defense, and to ensure a further improvement in the people's material and cultural standards.
    The achievements made by the Chinese Communist Party in the socialist transformation of the country demonstrate with irrefutable force the correctness of the Party's policy, which reflects the fundamental interests of the working people and has gained the enthusiastic support of the entire Chinese people.
    The Eighth National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party made a significant contribution to the further creative development of Marxism-Leninism. The Chinese Communist Party has achieved victories in the past and present due to its loyalty to Marxism-Leninism and its creative solution of complex problems based on specific historical conditions in the country. Marxism-Leninism is an ever-vigorous and invincible doctrine. It cannot tolerate rigid formulas and dogmatism, and it requires constant creation. The merit of the Chinese Communist Party lies in its ability to find new forms and methods of building socialism that are most suitable for China's actual conditions.
    The Eighth National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party demonstrated the great unity of all patriotic forces of the Chinese people, and the solidarity of all democratic parties effectively cooperating within the people's democratic front.
    China's experience powerfully confirms Lenin's prediction that future revolutions in Eastern countries with extremely large populations and diverse social conditions will certainly have many characteristics.
    The Chinese Communist Party faces new and more significant tasks, calling on all communist party members across the country to tirelessly improve the level of mobilization of their ranks, strengthen ties with the masses, teach the masses, and learn from the masses.
    The National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party was conducted under the slogans of militant proletarian internationalism, the unbreakable friendship of fraternal communist and worker parties, and the further strengthening of unity in the international worker movement to jointly strive for peace, national independence, and social progress. The speeches of representatives from more than fifty fraternal communist and worker parties powerfully demonstrated the close international ties of the Chinese Communist Party and the unity of all international communist forces under the banner of Leninism.
    The historic resolutions of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union have aroused a new upsurge in the international communist movement, the international worker movement, and the national liberation movement. These resolutions have been fully understood and enthusiastically supported by the great Chinese Communist Party, and by communist and worker parties in all countries.
    The internationalist nature of the common cause of the working class requires closer unity and friendship, contact and mutual support between the various Marxist-Leninist parties.
    The People's Republic of China has become a powerful factor for peace. It is fighting alongside all peace-loving people and countries for the victory of Lenin's idea of peaceful coexistence, and is crushing and exposing the aggressive plans of the enemies of peace and instigators of new wars. As a result of this heroic and proactive struggle, the People's Republic of China has won prestige in all countries, especially in Asian and African countries.
    Comrade Mao Zedong's words at the Congress were filled with confidence in the powerful strength of the Chinese people. He said: "The strength of the liberated Chinese people is infinite, and we also have the assistance of our great ally, the Soviet Union, and other fraternal countries, and we have the support of all fraternal parties in the world and the support of all sympathizers in the world. We do not feel isolated. In this way, we will certainly be able to build our country step by step into a great socialist industrialized country."
    The Soviet people are extremely concerned about the achievements of the People's Republic of China. In the congratulatory message from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to the Eighth National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, it stated, "The historically significant victory of the People's Republic of China has greatly excited the Soviet working people and made them proud to have such a friend and brother as the great Chinese people. We believe that the fraternal friendship between the people of our two countries is a guarantee for further strengthening the power of the world socialist system and consolidating lasting peace in the world."
    During the Eighth National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, millions of readers of "Pravda" read the full text of the various reports of the Congress and the speeches of prominent figures in the Party and the state. They were delighted by the spirit of extreme consistency and unity that was clearly demonstrated by the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people during the Congress meetings.
    The Soviet people and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union are jointly deeply encouraged by the historically significant resolutions of the Eighth National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, and they sincerely wish the Chinese friends new and brilliant achievements in the great cause of socialist construction.

    中国共产党代表大会的伟大历史意义
    ——苏联“真理报”九月二十九日社论
    中国共产党第八次全国代表大会9月27日在北京闭幕了。
    中国共产党代表大会是拥有六亿人口的中国的国内生活以及整个国际共产主义运动和工人运动的生活中的一件大事。
    代表大会总结了1945年4月第七次代表大会以来所完成的巨大工作，通过了党的章程，批准了关于第二个五年计划的建议。
    第八次全国代表大会在获得一致通过的关于中国共产党中央委员会的政治报告的决议中写道：“中国共产党第八次全国代表大会在讨论了刘少奇同志代表中国共产党中央委员会所作的政治报告以后，认为中央委员会从第七次全国代表大会以来所采取的政治路线是正确的，决定批准这个报告。”
    在过去的十一年中，中国彻底完成了资产阶级民主革命，并且获得了社会主义革命的有决定意义的胜利。代表大会指出，中国结束了阶级剥削的制度，建立了社会主义的社会制度。
    在伟大的人民革命胜利后，中华人民共和国的成立为中国人民的生活开辟了新的纪元。这个具有历史意义的胜利是伟大十月革命后最突出的一件事，它对东方国家的解放斗争的发展和世界历史的整个进程产生了巨大的影响。
    在社会主义革命胜利后的一个短短时期中，中国人民在光荣的共产党的领导下完成了伟大的民主改革，恢复了国民经济，现在坚定不移地沿着社会主义建设的道路前进，并且成功地克服这条光荣道路上的种种困难。
    中国共产党第八次全国代表大会确定了中国人民在争取社会主义的斗争中的新任务。中国共产党根据中国的具体情况正在胜利地实现自己的总路线，以便逐步实现国家的社会主义工业化，实现对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造。中国人民遵照党的总路线，在1953年开始执行发展国民经济的第一个五年计划。在这段时期内，农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造取得了决定性的胜利。社会主义经济成分的迅速发展，为国家的社会主义工业化创造了更加巩固的基础。在第一个五年计划期间，将约有五百个大工业项目投入生产，它们将成为国家工业的进一步发展的基地。
    代表大会通过的关于第二个五年计划的建议是争取社会主义的伟大纲领。中央委员会向代表大会所作的政治报告中指出，第二个五年计划的基本任务是继续优先发展重工业，着重国民经济的技术改造，为国家的社会主义工业化建立巩固的基础，彻底完成社会主义改造，加强国防力量，保证进一步提高人民的物质水平和文化水平。
    中国共产党在国家的社会主义改造方面所取得的成就，以无可反驳的力量证明了党的政策的正确性，这一政策反映了劳动人民的根本利益，并且获得了全体中国人民的热烈支持。
    中国共产党第八次全国代表大会对进一步创造性地发展马克思列宁主义作了重大的贡献。中国共产党由于忠于马克思列宁主义，由于根据国内具体的历史条件创造性地解决复杂的问题，过去和现在都获得了胜利。马克思列宁主义是永远生气勃勃的、战无不胜的学说。它不能容忍死板公式和教条主义，要求不断的创造。中国共产党的功绩在于善于寻找最适合中国实际情况的建设社会主义的新形式和新方法。
    中国共产党第八次全国代表大会表明了中国人民一切爱国力量的伟大团结，表明了在人民民主战线内有效地合作的一切民主党派的团结一致。
    中国的经验有力地证实了列宁的这种预见：在人口极其众多、社会条件多种多样的东方国家里，今后的革命一定会具有许多特点。
    中国共产党面临着新的、更加重大的任务，它号召全国共产党员不倦地提高自己队伍的动员程度，加强同群众的联系，教导群众并且向群众学习。
    中国共产党的全国代表大会是在战斗的无产阶级国际主义的口号下，在兄弟共产党和工人党的牢不可破的友谊的口号下，在国际工人运动进一步加强团结共同为和平、民族独立和社会进步而斗争的口号下进行的。五十多个兄弟共产党和工人党的代表的发言，极其有力地证明了中国共产党的密切的国际联系，证明了一切国际共产主义力量在列宁主义的旗帜下的团结一致。
    苏联共产党第二十次代表大会的历史性决议引起了国际共产主义运动、国际工人运动和民族解放运动的新的高涨。这些决议得到伟大的中国共产党、各国共产党和工人党的充分理解和热烈支持。
    工人阶级共同事业的国际主义性质要求各个马克思列宁主义政党之间有更加密切的团结和友谊、接触和互相支持。
    中华人民共和国已经成为一个强大的和平因素。它正在同一切爱好和平的人民和国家一起为列宁的和平共处思想的胜利而奋斗，正在粉碎、揭露和平的敌人、新战争挑拨者的侵略计划。由于这个英勇的、主动的斗争，中华人民共和国在一切国家中、特别是在亚非国家中赢得了威信。
    毛泽东同志在代表大会上所说的话充满了对中国人民的强大力量的信心。他说：“已经得到解放的中国人民的力量是无穷无尽的，我们又有伟大的盟国苏联和其他兄弟国家的援助，我们又有世界上一切兄弟党的支持，又有世界上一切同情者的支持，我们并没有孤立的感觉，这样，我们就一定能够一步一步地把我国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义工业化的国家。”
    苏联人民极其关心中华人民共和国的成就。在苏联共产党中央委员会致中国共产党第八次全国代表大会的贺词中说，“中华人民共和国的具有历史意义的胜利，使苏联劳动人民非常兴奋，使他们因为有伟大的中国人民这样一个朋友和兄弟而感到骄傲。我们认为，我们两国人民的兄弟般的友谊，是进一步加强世界社会主义体系威力的保证，是巩固世界持久和平的保证。”
    在中国共产党第八次全国代表大会期间，“真理报”的千百万读者读到了代表大会各项报告的全文、党和国家的著名人物的发言，他们为中国共产党和人民在代表大会会议期间所明显表现的那种极其一致和团结的精神而高兴。
    苏联人民和苏联共产党同中国人民共同为中国共产党第八次全国代表大会具有历史意义的决议而深感鼓舞，并且衷心地祝中国朋友在社会主义建设的伟大事业中获得新的辉煌成就。
