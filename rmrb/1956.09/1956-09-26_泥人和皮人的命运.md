The clay figures of Huishan, Wuxi, which have a history of several hundred years, possess the characteristics of folk art: some have upright shapes and simple colors; others are exquisitely crafted and meticulously painted. Not only have our ancestors praised them, but foreigners have also admired them. However, generally speaking, the fate of the clay figures is not good. Before liberation, clay figures suffered all kinds of harassment from the reactionary rulers. After liberation, one would think that the clay figures should have turned over a new leaf, but this was not the case: first, they were accused of "superstition" and "feudalism," and the valuable finished products and molds passed down by generations of artists all returned to their mother's home – becoming mud again. And now, perhaps the "mud" on Huishan is too "backward" and has been replaced by "advanced" plaster transported from other places; the artists' "hands" are too "unscientific," and the meticulous painting has been replaced by modern sprayers manufactured in Shanghai. In this way, at first glance, it seems very "modernized" and "scientific," but unfortunately, the characteristics of Huishan clay figures, one of the excellent folk arts, are no longer visible, and they have become vulgar and unbearable monstrosities.

For the same reason, shadow puppetry, which has always attracted audiences with its two-dimensional beauty, seems to be moving towards "three-dimensional" direction: semi-profile shadow puppets have appeared; some "leather" is also giving way to silk fabrics. Not only that, but in the shadow puppet shows recently performed abroad, one can even see dazzling and flickering projected waves. Of course, this painstaking effort is commendable. The waves are also very realistic. But unfortunately, they have no connection with the deformed and beautified original shadow puppets, like attaching a horse's mouth to an ox's head.

I think the reason why clay figures and shadow puppets still have value in this advanced era is probably because they each have their own characteristics, right? A clay figure is a clay figure; it should be different from the Venus de Milo. A shadow puppet is a shadow puppet; it should be different from the opera Sadko. This is just like how you cannot equate Qimen black tea and Longjing green tea. People who love to drink black tea should be able to drink better black tea, and people who like to drink green tea should be able to drink better green tea, and definitely not create something that is neither black nor green.

If the work of transforming folk art is not carried out according to their own characteristics, even if "scientific" and "modern" methods are used, it will not work, and the result will be to "transform" them into nothingness. Isn't the fate of Huishan clay figures in Wuxi the best example? And if this continues, who can guarantee that the fate of clay figures today will not be the fate of shadow puppets tomorrow?

    泥人和皮人的命运
    米谷
    已经有几百年历史的无锡惠山泥人，具有民间艺术的特色：有的造型端正，色彩淳朴；有的捏作精巧，描绘细致。不但我们的先辈人人称道，连外国人也赞叹不绝。可是总的说来，泥人的命运并不好。解放前，泥人遭到过反动统治者的种种作难；解放后，照理泥人也该翻身了，但却不然：先是在“迷信”、“封建”等罪状下遭受了指责，历代艺人相传下来的珍贵成品和模子，都回了娘家——变成了烂泥。而如今呢，大概惠山上的“泥”太“落后”了，已被外地运去的“先进”石膏代替了；艺人们的“手”太“不科学”了，精描细绘已被上海制造的现代化的喷色器取而代之了。这样，猛一看，好像很“现代化”、“科学化”，可惜优秀的民间艺术之一的惠山泥人的特色却看不见了，变成了庸俗不堪的怪东西。
    由于同样的原因，一向以平面的美而吸引观众的皮影戏似乎也在走上“立体”的道路：出现了半侧面的皮人；部分“皮”也正在让位于丝织品。不仅如此，在最近作出国演出的皮影幕上，竟使人看到了耀眼闪烁的幻灯海浪。自然，这苦心是可嘉的。海浪也非常逼真。但可惜它们同变了形的、美化了的原有皮人毫无姻缘，就像牛头上装上了一张马嘴。
    我想，泥人、皮影之所以在这先进的时代还有存在和发展的价值，恐怕是因为它们各有自己的特点吧？泥人就是泥人，它同希腊维纳斯应该有别；皮影就是皮影，它同歌剧萨特阔应该有别。这正像不能在祁门红茶和龙井清茶之间划等号一样。应该让爱喝红茶的人喝上更好的红茶，让喜饮清茶的人饮到更好的清茶，而决不是搞出一些非红非清的东西来。
    对民间艺术的改造工作倘不按照它们自身的特点进行，那怕用了“科学化”、“现代化”的手法，也是不行的，结果会把它们“化”为乌有。无锡惠山泥人的命运难道不是一个最好的例子吗？而这样干下去，谁又能保证今天泥人的命运不就是明天皮人的命运呢？
