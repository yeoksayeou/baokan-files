Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, September 9th: Pakistani Prime Minister Muhammad Ali issued a statement on September 8th, explaining the reasons for his withdrawal from the Muslim League and his resignation as Prime Minister.

In this statement, he said: "I have decided with great regret to sever my relationship with the Muslim League. I made this decision after careful consideration and after a careful study of the development of the situation in our country in the past few months, and with pain."

Ali said, "On the advice of prominent members of the West Pakistan Muslim League, I announced on March 28 this year that Sahib Khan should continue as Chief Minister for the broader interest of the unity of West Pakistan Province. But when the West Pakistan Muslim League Parliamentary Party met on April 3, 1956, these leaders broke their word and refused to accept Sahib Khan as Chief Minister."

He said: "I convened a Joint Party meeting in Karachi on August 27. However, some Muslim League members of the National Assembly deliberately absented themselves."

Ali said: "I have become increasingly aware that some leaders of the Muslim League are determined to block all avenues for me to serve the country." What happened at the public rally celebrating Pakistan's Independence Day further proved that some people in the Muslim League are stubbornly prepared to sacrifice the country's prestige for their personal prejudices.

He said that at the meeting on August 27, the majority of the members of the Joint Party expressed their trust in me. Therefore, under normal circumstances, I should not resign as Prime Minister. However, since I have decided to withdraw from the Muslim League, I must also resign as Prime Minister, which I consider a matter of dignity.

Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, September 10th: The tense political activity in the Pakistani capital Karachi, caused by Prime Minister Ali's resignation, is continuing. President Mirza held a three-hour luncheon meeting on the 9th with opposition People's League leader Suhrawardy, Republican Party leader Malik Firoz Noon, and Amir Azam Khan. Mirza also held talks with West Pakistan Chief Minister Sahib Khan, United Front leader and Foreign Minister Chaudhry, and other political leaders. On the same day, members of the Republican Party, the United Front, the People's League, and the Muslim League also held their own small group talks. According to Karachi newspapers, many Republicans are urging President Mirza to ask Muhammad Ali to form a new government, a proposal supported by leaders of the United Front and the Nizam-i-Islami Party. However, some Republicans are campaigning for Republican leader Malik Firoz Noon to become Prime Minister.

    巴总统同各政党领袖会谈解决内阁危机
    阿里总理发表声明解释辞职原因
    据新华社喀喇蚩9日讯　巴基斯坦总理穆罕默德·阿里9月8日发表声明，解释他退出穆斯林联盟和辞去总理职务的原因。
    他在这篇声明中说：“我已经非常遗憾地决定断绝我同穆斯林联盟的关系。我是在深思熟虑以后并且是在对我国过去几个月中的时局发展作了仔细的研究以后忍痛作出这个决定的。”
    阿里说，我曾经根据西巴基斯坦穆斯林联盟著名盟员们的建议在今年3月28日宣布，为了西巴基斯坦省的团结这种更广泛的利益，萨希布汗应该继续担任首席部长。“但是当西巴基斯坦穆斯林联盟议会党团在1956年4月3日开会的时候，这些领袖们竟食言而拒绝接受萨希布汗为首席部长。”
    他说：“我在8月27日在喀喇蚩召开了联合党会议。可是，国民议会中的某些穆斯林联盟议员却故意缺席。”
    阿里说：“我愈来愈明白，穆斯林联盟的一部分领导人员决心想阻塞我为国家服务的一切道路”。在为庆祝巴基斯坦独立日所举行的公众集会上所发生的事进一步证明，穆斯林联盟中的某些人士顽固地准备为了他们个人的偏见而牺牲国家的威望。
    他说，在8月27日的会议上，联合党的大多数成员都表示信任我。因此，在通常情况下，我是不应当辞去总理职务的。但是，既然我已经决定退出穆斯林联盟，我必须也辞去总理的职务，我认为这是有关体面的事。
    据新华社喀喇蚩10日电　由于阿里总理辞职而在巴基斯坦首都喀喇蚩引起的紧张政治活动仍在继续中。米尔扎总统在9日同反对党人民联盟的领袖苏拉瓦底、共和党的领袖马利克·菲罗兹·努恩和阿米尔·阿扎姆汗举行了三小时的午餐会谈。米尔扎还同西巴基斯坦首席部长萨希布汗，联合阵线领袖、外交部长乔德里以及其他政界领袖举行了会谈。同一天，共和党、联合阵线、人民联盟和穆斯林联盟的成员还举行了他们自己之间的小组会谈。据喀喇蚩报纸报道，许多共和党人正在敦促米尔扎总统要求穆罕默德·阿里组织新政府，这个主张得到联合阵线和尼扎姆伊斯兰党的领袖们的支持。但是一部分共和党人正在活动，要求由共和党领袖马利克·菲罗兹·努恩出任总理。
