    Lu Xun's Hometown Actively Prepares for Activities Commemorating Lu Xun

    (Our newspaper dispatch) The people of Shaoxing are actively preparing various commemorative activities for the 75th anniversary of Lu Xun's birth and the 20th anniversary of his death.

    This year's commemorative activities will be the largest in scale since liberation. The Shaoxing Lu Xun Memorial Hall has transported a large number of Lu Xun's manuscripts, as well as photos and replicas of his life in Shanghai, Guangzhou, and other places from the Lu Xun Memorial Halls in Shanghai and Beijing. The museum's cultural relic exhibition room is being rearranged and displayed. The museum's displays will fully reflect Lu Xun's life in his hometown, the local characteristics of Shaoxing, and the characteristics of the social environment and political and economic conditions of that time. The old home of Xintai Gate, where Lu Xun lived in his childhood, was sold due to his grandfather's imprisonment and his father's illness, resulting in the rebuilding of most of the houses. In order to restore the original appearance of the former residence, construction workers have been working hard to repair it in recent days and it will soon be completed. Art teachers are further designing the greening of Baicao Garden, the rest park, and the open space from Xintai Gate to Laotai Gate. A model of the birthplace of Lu Xun has begun to be sculpted. The Lu Xun Memorial Hall has also purchased some houses near the former residence for guests to rest.

    From September 25th (Lu Xun's birthday) to October 19th (the anniversary of Lu Xun's death), all four parts of the Lu Xun Memorial Hall – the new and old Taiment, the cultural relics exhibition room, the Sanwei Study, and the Baicao Garden – will be fully open for visitors from all over the world to visit.

    鲁迅故乡积极筹备纪念鲁迅的活动
    本报讯　绍兴人民正在积极筹备鲁迅诞辰七十五周年、逝世二十周年的各项纪念活动。
    今年的纪念活动将是解放以来规模最大的一次。绍兴鲁迅纪念馆已经从上海、北京的鲁迅纪念馆运来了大批鲁迅先生的著作手迹，以及在上海、广州等地的生活片断等内容的照片和复制品。该馆的文物陈列室正在重新进行布置陈设。纪念馆的陈设将充分反映鲁迅先生在故乡时期的生活状况、绍兴乡土本色和当年社会环境，政治经济状况等特点。鲁迅先生童年时代生活的地方——故居新台门，曾因当年他的祖父入狱、父亲生病而出卖，致使大部房屋被翻造，为了恢复故居原来的面貌，连日来建筑工人们正在紧张地进行修建工作，不久即将完工。美术教师们正在进一步绿化百草园、休息公园和新台门到老台门一带空地的设计工作。鲁迅诞生地点的模型已在动手塑造。鲁迅纪念馆并在故居附近购置了部分房屋，供作来宾们休息之用。
    从9月25日（鲁迅诞辰）到10月19日（鲁迅逝世纪念日）鲁迅纪念馆的四个部分——故居新、老台门，文物陈列室，三味书屋和百草园都将全部开放，供各地来宾参观。
