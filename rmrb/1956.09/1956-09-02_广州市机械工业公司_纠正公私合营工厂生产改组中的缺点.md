Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 31st: Xinhua News Agency reporter Fang Li reports: The Guangzhou Municipal Mechanical Industry Company is resolving shortcomings and lingering problems in the production reorganization of its affiliated industries.

    The company manages more than 490 factories across 24 industries. Since most of these factories are small, dispersed, highly specialized in their processes, and have large production tasks, it would be difficult to improve product output and quality without appropriate mergers and centralized production. Therefore, in the production reorganization carried out in the first half of this year, these factories were substantially reduced and merged, consolidating more than 490 factories into 55. However, due to a lack of experience in production reorganization work and other reasons, the company, after inspections and soliciting opinions from industrial and commercial figures in the months following the reorganization, discovered some non-negligible shortcomings. The most prominent of these is that the reorganization excessively emphasized increasing manufacturing strength, merging too many repair shops into manufacturing plants, resulting in a very unbalanced ratio between manufacturing and repair, and strained repair cooperation. Secondly, some factories with expertise in producing a particular product were inappropriately merged with other factories, hindering their independent development. Some service-oriented factories also cut too many retail outlets, causing inconvenience to customers. Furthermore, from the perspective of cooperative relations, some factories that should have been managed by other departments were also inappropriately placed under the management of the Mechanical Industry Company.

    The Guangzhou Municipal Mechanical Industry Company, in response to these shortcomings and problems, and after careful study and planning, with the approval of the municipal authorities, is addressing these issues one by one. Thirty-one factories originally specializing in repairing various machines were inappropriately reorganized and merged into two agricultural implement factories, which were later merged into the local state-owned Guangdong Agricultural Implement Factory. Now, twenty-seven of these thirty-one factories have been re-established to form two relatively large repair factories, responsible for repairing machine tools, drilling machines, hydraulic machinery, and grain milling machines, respectively. Coupled with existing diesel engine repair factories and textile knitting machine repair factories, the balance between manufacturing and repair capabilities in the mechanical industry will be gradually restored, and the current strained repair cooperation situation will be alleviated. Some factories with expertise in producing a particular product that had been inappropriately merged into other factories have recently been restored as independent factories or converted into independent workshops. Dongchanglong and Xinxing were originally two factories with specialized skills in manufacturing and repairing printing presses, and their products have always been welcomed by users in various regions. However, in the production reorganization, they were mistakenly merged into a diesel engine manufacturing factory. Recently, these two factories have been re-established and merged into one factory specializing in manufacturing and repairing printing presses. Lin Liyuan Factory, famous for manufacturing steaming utensils, which had been inappropriately merged into Xiehe Petroleum Accessories Factory, has also been restored as an independent factory. Liangguang Automobile Parts Factory has reorganized the Dehua and Yucheng factories, which originally specialized in producing piston blanks, into an independent workshop to maintain their original excellent products. Some service-oriented factories, such as fire extinguisher manufacturing factories and typewriter repair factories, reduced some retail outlets during the reorganization, causing customer dissatisfaction, and are now looking for suitable locations to open new retail outlets. Due to inadequate consideration during the reorganization, more than forty large and small factories, including the wooden boat manufacturing factory, boiler repair factory, and welding factory, which had close ties with the Zhujiang Shipping Administration Bureau in manufacturing and repairing ships, were inappropriately placed under the management of the Mechanical Industry Company, which affected cooperation in ship repair and construction. Recently, the Mechanical Industry Company and the Zhujiang Shipping Administration Bureau, after consultation, decided to transfer this group of factories to the leadership of the Zhujiang Shipping Administration Bureau. In addition, some factories have also been transferred to other departments for management based on different circumstances.

    Other industrial professional companies in Guangzhou are also taking measures to correct some of the shortcomings in the production reorganization of various industries, so that the joint public-private factories can exert greater strength in production in the future.

    纠正公私合营工厂生产改组中的缺点
    新华社广州31日电　新华社记者方力报道：广州市机械工业公司正在解决所属行业在生产改组中存在的缺点和遗留问题。
    这个公司共管辖二十四个行业的四百九十多家工厂。由于这些工厂大部分规模小而且分散，工艺性高，生产任务大，如果不适当地合并和集中生产，将难以提高产品的产量和质量。因此，今年上半年在进行生产改组中，就把这些厂作了较大的裁并，把四百九十多家工厂改组合并为五十五家工厂。但是，因为对生产改组工作缺乏经验以及其他原因，改组后的几个月以来，公司经过检查和征求工商界人士的意见，发现改组工作中存在一些不容忽视的缺点。其中最突出的是由于在改组的时候过分强调了增加制造力量，过多地把修理厂并入到制造厂，使得制造和修理两方面的比重很不平衡，修理协作关系紧张。其次是把一些生产某一产品有专长的工厂，不适当地同别的工厂合并，妨碍其独立发展。也有一些服务性的工厂裁并了过多的门市部，使顾客感到不方便。此外，从协作关系来看，一些应由其他部门管理的工厂也不适当地划归机械工业公司管理。
    广州市机械工业公司针对着这些缺点和问题，经过缜密研究和规划，在得到市的主管部门批准以后，正在对这些问题逐一加以解决。原来有三十一家专业修理各种机器的工厂，曾被不适当地合并改组成为两个农具制造厂，后来又把这两个厂并到了地方国营广东农具厂。现在已把这三十一家工厂中的二十七家重新划出，组成两家比较大的修理厂，分别担负工作母机、钻探机、水利机械和谷米机等的修理任务；再加上现有的柴油机修理厂和纺织针织机器修理厂等修理厂，机械业的制造和修理力量将可以逐步恢复平衡，目前修理协作关系紧张的情况将缓和下去。一些曾经被不适当地并入别厂的生产某一产品具有专长的工厂，最近已陆续恢复为独立工厂或改为独立车间。东昌隆和新兴原来是两家在制造和修理印刷机方面有特长的工厂，产品向来受到各地用户的欢迎，但是在生产改组中，却被错误地合并到一家柴油机制造厂。最近这两家厂已被重新划出，并且合并成为一家专业制造和修理印刷机的工厂。曾被不适当地并到协和石油配件厂的以制造甑类产品出名的林利源厂，也已被恢复为独立的工厂。联光汽车零件厂已将并入的原来生产活塞坯有专长的德华和裕成两厂改组成为一个独立车间，以保持它们原来的优良产品。一些服务性的工厂，如灭火筒制造厂和打字机修造厂等在改组的时候，减少了一些门市部，引起顾客的不满，现在正在找寻适当地点开设新的门市部。改组的时候由于考虑不周，曾经把同珠江航运管理局制造和修理船舶有密切关系的木船制造厂、锅炉修理厂和烧焊厂等四十多个大小工厂，不适当地划归机械工业公司管理，结果影响了船舶修造方面的协作关系。最近机械工业公司和珠江航运管理局经过协议，决定把这一批工厂划归珠江航运管理局领导。此外，还有一些工厂也根据不同情况，移交给其他部门管理。
    广州市其他各个工业专业公司，目前也都在采取措施，纠正各行业在生产改组中所存在的一些缺点，使各公私合营工厂今后在生产上能够发挥更大的力量。
