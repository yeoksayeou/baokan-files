Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 3rd Dispatch: Under pressure from the United States, the Japanese Defense Agency plans to increase military spending by more than 27% in the next fiscal year to accelerate military expansion.

According to the Defense Agency's proposed military budget, Japan's direct military expenditure in fiscal year 1957 will total over 150 billion yen. This includes 127.8 billion yen for the "Defense Agency Expenses" for Japanese military measures, 15 billion yen for "Defense Burden Sharing Fees" to support the stationed US forces in Japan, and 10.5 billion yen for maintaining US military facilities.

The proposed "Defense Agency Expenses" for the next fiscal year is 27.6 billion yen more than this year. According to Kyodo News, this is to implement the six-year military expansion plan, which includes expanding the army by 10,000 troops, increasing naval vessels by 5,500 tons, and adding 300 air force aircraft in fiscal year 1957. A new draft six-year military expansion plan recently formulated by the Defense Agency stipulates that by 1960, Japan will expand its army to 180,000 troops, increase naval vessels to 110,000 tons, and increase air force aircraft to 1,300. Currently, Japan's army has more than 148,000 troops; the navy has more than 19,000 personnel and a total of more than 86,000 tons of vessels; and the air force has more than 10,500 personnel and 401 aircraft.

According to Kyodo News, the Defense Agency's massive military budget has already been opposed by some officials of the Ministry of Finance. They had to admit that allocating more than 150 billion yen for military expansion is too heavy a burden for the Japanese people.

    日本准备执行六年扩军计划
    防卫厅计划明年度大量增加军费
    据新华社3日讯　东京消息：日本防卫厅在美国要求下，计划在明年度把军费增加27％以上，来加速扩充军备。
    根据防卫厅提出的军费预算，在1957年度内，日本的直接军费共达一千五百亿日元以上，其中用于日本军事措施方面的“防卫厅经费”达一千二百七十八亿日元，用来供养驻日美军的“防卫分担费”达一百五十亿日元，用来维持美国军事设施的费用达一百零五亿日元。
    这个军费预算要求拨出的下年度“防卫厅经费”比今年度增加了二百七十六亿日元之多。据共同社报道，这是为了执行六年扩军计划，在1957年度扩充陆军一万人，增加海军舰艇五千五百吨和空军飞机三百架。防卫厅最近拟订的一个新的六年扩军计划草案规定，到1960年，日本要把陆军扩充到十八万人，把海军舰艇增加到十一万吨，把空军飞机增加到一千三百架。目前，日本的陆军有十四万八千多人；海军有一万九千多人，舰艇共八万六千多吨；空军有一万零五百多人，飞机四百零一架。
    据共同社报道，防卫厅的这个庞大的军费预算已经遭到大藏省的某些官员的反对。他们不得不承认，拨出一千五百多亿日元用来扩充军备对日本国民的负担是太重了。
