    Xinhua News Agency, September 12th dispatch from Cairo: Arab political figures and diplomatic envoys in Egypt, in their talks with "Al-Ahram" newspaper, expressed their support for the Egyptian government's proposal to convene a broad international conference to discuss the Suez Canal issue.
     "Al-Ahram" published their talks on September 11th.
    Arab League Secretary-General Hassouna said that this proposal shows that Egypt has peaceful intentions and abides by the principles of justice. This proposal shows that Egypt, while insisting on all its rights, is also prepared to discuss any solution that leads to a peaceful settlement.
    Lebanese Minister of State Salam, who is currently in Cairo, said that all Arab countries fully agree with the content of the Egyptian memorandum and fully support any measures taken by Egypt. "The West should seize the good opportunity provided by the Egyptian memorandum and should let everyone know that they want to conduct peaceful negotiations."
    Syrian Ambassador Abdul Rahman Azzam said, "Egypt is not only consolidating its strong position, but also taking the initiative. If the West does not agree to this new proposal, then it will find itself facing a strong unified Arab front."
    Jordanian Ambassador Fazi Murki said, "The proposal reflects Egypt's goodwill. It should be able to satisfy those countries that truly only want to maintain freedom of navigation."
    On the same day, the Middle East News Agency reported that Syria, Jordan, and Afghanistan had all notified Egypt, expressing their approval of Egypt's proposal. This news agency also said that some diplomats believe that the Egyptian government's proposal is a clue to the peaceful settlement of the Suez Canal issue. This proposed conference is a peace conference.

    苏彝士运河问题必须通过广泛的国际会议来解决
    阿拉伯各国赞成埃及政府的新建议
    伊拉克首相表示坚决支持埃及抵抗侵略
    据新华社12日讯　开罗消息：在埃及的阿拉伯各国政界人士和外交使节在对“金字塔报”发表的谈话中，都表示支持埃及政府提出的召开广泛的国际会议来讨论苏彝士运河问题的建议。
     “金字塔报”在9月11日刊载了他们的谈话。
    阿拉伯联盟秘书长哈苏纳说，这个建议表明埃及具有和平意图并且遵守正义的原则。这个建议表明，埃及一面坚持它的一切权利，同时也准备讨论任何导致和平解决的方案。
    现在开罗的黎巴嫩国务部长萨拉姆说，所有阿拉伯国家都完全同意埃及照会的内容，并且全力支持埃及所采取的任何措施。“西方应该利用埃及照会所提供的良好机会，并且应该让大家知道他们是想进行和平谈判”。
    叙利亚大使阿卜杜勒·拉赫曼·阿扎姆说，“埃及不仅仅巩固它的坚固的阵地，而且取得了主动权。假如西方不同意这个新建议，那么它会发现自己面对着一个坚强的阿拉伯统一战线”。
    约旦大使法齐·穆尔基说，“建议反映了埃及的善意。它应该能够使那些真正只想维护通航自由的国家感到满意”。
    同一天，中东通讯社报道，叙利亚、约旦和阿富汗三国都已通知埃及，表示赞成埃及的建议。这家通讯社还说，某些外交人士认为埃及政府的建议是和平解决苏彝士运河问题的一个线索。这个拟议中的会议是一次和平会议。
    新华社12日讯　开罗消息：据中东通讯社自巴格达报道，伊拉克首相努里·赛义德告诉正在伊拉克访问的黎巴嫩议员埃米尔·布斯塔尼说，万一埃及遭到攻击，伊拉克将站在“阿拉伯国家的最前哨来支持埃及”。
    这家通讯社还说，伊拉克政府的一位发言人说，鉴于法国在地中海东部的军事调动，伊拉克已正式向法国提出抗议。
