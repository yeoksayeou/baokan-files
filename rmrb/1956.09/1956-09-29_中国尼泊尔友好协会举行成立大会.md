Xinhua News Agency, 28th. Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Nepal, Tanka Prasad Acharya, and China's Premier Zhou Enlai, jointly attended the inaugural meeting of the China-Nepal Friendship Association today. Zhou Jianren, the president of the association, pointed out at the meeting that "The establishment of the China-Nepal Friendship Association has opened up a broader path for the friendly relations and mutual cooperation between our two countries. Prime Minister Acharya and other distinguished Nepalese guests, Premier Zhou Enlai and representatives from the Chinese government and various circles were invited to participate in today's inaugural meeting, which is a very memorable event in the course of China-Nepal friendship."

In his speech to the more than six hundred Chinese and foreign guests present, Zhou Jianren reviewed the friendly relations between China and Nepal, which began more than 1,500 years ago. He pointed out that although the friendly exchanges between our two countries had been hindered in modern times due to imperialist obstruction, the friendly relations between the Chinese and Nepalese people have developed and become closer with the times. Since China and Nepal established diplomatic relations on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence in August 1955, the friendly relations between China and Nepal have entered a new stage.

In his speech, Zhou Jianren mentioned the long-standing cultural ties between China and Nepal, saying that the Chinese monks Xuanzang and Faxian had both visited Nepal. The Nepalese monk Buddhabhadra came to China in 406 AD and co-translated several famous Buddhist scriptures with Faxian. Many Nepalese artisans also came to China and cooperated with their Chinese counterparts to build many magnificent temples and palaces. The Potala Palace in Tibet, China, retains this unique style that integrates Chinese and Nepalese architectural art. These crystallizations of the labor and wisdom of the Chinese and Nepalese people still demonstrate their majestic spirit and radiate brilliant light to this day. Zhou Jianren said that the association's purpose is to develop friendly relations and cultural exchanges between China and Nepal. With the strong support of the Chinese people and the enthusiastic care and cooperation of the Nepalese people, the association will surely undertake its solemn mission.

Lieutenant General Rana, the Nepalese Ambassador to China, congratulated the establishment of the China-Nepal Friendship Association. He said that the East, which had once declined, has begun to shine again as it did in the past. Therefore, we must use the friendship association established today as a medium to exchange our ideas and literature, so that we can unite together. We must earnestly strive to understand each other, not only through political connections, but also through social interactions, and this interaction can only be achieved through such a friendship association.

The inaugural meeting was held at 2:00 p.m. today. The meeting hall was decorated with the national flags of China and Nepal and a banner with the golden characters "Long Live China-Nepal Friendship" on a red background. The front of the rostrum was filled with flowers. The wife of the Nepalese Prime Minister, the Foreign Affairs Secretary of the Nepalese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Narapratap Thapa, Vice-Chairman of the Nepal-China Friendship Association, and other distinguished Nepalese guests, Vice-Chairman Guo Moruo, Vice-Chairman Chen Shutong, Minister of Foreign Trade Ye Jizhuang, Minister of Culture Shen Yanbing, Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhang Hanfu, Chinese Ambassador to Nepal Pan Zili, the directors of the China-Nepal Friendship Association, representatives of the sponsoring organizations, and famous people from all walks of life in the capital attended the inaugural meeting.

After the Vice President of the Association, Zhou Shujia, gave a brief opening speech, Zhou Jianren and Ambassador Rana spoke at the meeting successively. Zhang Yihua, the Director-General of the Association, read out the telegram from the Nepal-China Friendship Association to the China-Nepal Friendship Association.

Then, a group of young women dressed in costumes of various Chinese ethnic groups walked onto the stage holding gifts from the China-Nepal Friendship Association, such as Chinese paintings, porcelain vases, and palace lanterns, and presented them to Prime Minister Acharya and the Nepal-China Friendship Association, and presented flowers to all the distinguished Nepalese guests. At this time, the warm applause in the hall lasted for a long time.

After the inaugural meeting, Prime Minister Acharya, Premier Zhou Enlai and the guests attended a reception to celebrate the establishment of the association, and enjoyed the pictures of China-Nepal friendship and Chinese and Nepalese songs and dances displayed in the venue.

    中国尼泊尔友好协会举行成立大会
    新华社28日讯　尼泊尔王国坦卡·普拉萨德·阿查里雅首相和我国周恩来总理今天一同出席了中国尼泊尔友好协会成立大会。协会会长周建人在会上指出，“中尼友好协会的成立为我们两国的友好关系和相互合作开辟了更加宽广的途径。阿查里雅首相及其他尼泊尔贵宾，周恩来总理和我国政府及各界人士应邀参加今天的成立大会，是中尼友好发展的路程上十分值得纪念的事情。”
    周建人在他向到会的六百多位中外来宾发表的讲话中，回顾了中尼两国在一千五百多年以前开始的友好关系。他指出尽管近代以来由于帝国主义的阻挠，我们两国的友好往来曾经受到阻碍，但是中尼人民的友好关系却随时代而更加发展更加密切了。而在1955年8月中国和尼泊尔在五项原则的基础上建立了外交关系以后，中尼两国的友好关系已进入一个新阶段。
    周建人在讲话中谈到中尼两国悠久的文化联系时说，中国的高僧玄奘、法显等都到过尼泊尔。尼泊尔的高僧佛驮跋陀罗在公元406年曾来过中国，并和法显合译了几部有名的佛经。许多尼泊尔艺术匠人也来过中国，和中国的同行合作建造了许多巍峨宏丽的庙宇和宫殿。中国西藏的布达拉宫就保持有这种中尼建筑艺术相融合的独特风格。这些中尼两国人民劳动和智慧的结晶，直到今天仍然表现出雄伟的气魄和放射着绚丽的光彩。周建人说，协会的宗旨是发展中尼两国之间的友好关系和文化交流，在中国人民的大力支持和尼泊尔人民的热情关怀和合作下，协会一定会担负起它所负的庄严的使命。
    尼泊尔驻华大使拉纳中将祝贺中尼友好协会的成立，他说，曾经一度衰落的东方已经又像过去一样，重新开始发出光辉，所以，我们必须以今天成立的友好协会作为媒介，来交流我们的思想和文学，使我们团结在一起，我们必须认真地来努力互相了解，不仅是通过政治的联系，也要通过社会的交往，而这种交往只有通过这样的友好协会才可以实现。
    成立大会在今天下午二时举行，会场悬挂着中国、尼泊尔的国旗和红底金字的“中国尼泊尔友好万岁”的标语，主席台前摆满了鲜花。尼泊尔首相的夫人，尼泊尔外交部外事秘书、尼中友好协会副主席纳腊普腊塔普·塔帕和其他的尼泊尔贵宾，郭沫若副委员长、陈叔通副委员长、对外贸易部部长叶季壮、文化部部长沈雁冰、外交部副部长章汉夫和中国驻尼泊尔大使潘自力，中尼友好协会的理事们，各发起团体的代表和首都各界著名人士参加了成立大会。
    协会副会长周叔迦致简短的开会词后，周建人和拉纳大使相继在会上讲话，协会总干事张亦桦在会上宣读了中尼友好协会致尼中友好协会的电文。
    接着，一群穿着中国各民族服装的女青年捧着中国尼泊尔友好协会赠送的国画、磁瓶、宫灯等礼品走上主席台，献给阿查里雅首相和尼中友好协会，并且向全体尼泊尔贵宾们献了鲜花。这时，会场内热烈的掌声经久不息。
    在成立大会以后，阿查里雅首相、周恩来总理和来宾们参加了庆祝协会成立的酒会，欣赏了陈列在会场上的中尼友好的图片和中国、尼泊尔的歌舞。
