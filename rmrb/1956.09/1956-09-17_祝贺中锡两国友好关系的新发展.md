    Congratulating the New Development of Friendly Relations Between China and Ceylon
    The government delegations of Ceylon and China, after friendly and harmonious talks in Beijing, the capital of China, decided to recommend to their respective governments that, once necessary arrangements are made, the two countries will exchange diplomatic representatives at the ambassadorial level. The two government delegations also reached broad agreements on developing economic cooperation, trade relations, and strengthening cultural exchanges between the two countries. From now on, the friendship between the people of China and Ceylon will enter a new era, and the friendly cooperation between the two countries will have broader prospects. The Chinese people are delighted to congratulate the new development of friendly relations between China and Ceylon.
    The Chinese and Ceylonese people have always had traditional, harmonious, and friendly relations. Both China and Ceylon are ancient civilized countries in Asia. Although separated by mountains and seas, the friendship between the people of the two countries has never been interrupted. As early as nearly two thousand years ago, China and Ceylon had very close connections in Buddhism, culture, and trade. In Chinese historical records, there are many rich and vivid accounts of the friendly relations between China and Ceylon. There has never been hostility or war between the Chinese and Ceylonese people, only mutual trust and respect. Even in modern times, although both China and Ceylon suffered from the aggression and enslavement of Western colonialism, and various obstacles were set up between our two peoples, the people of the two countries have always sympathized with and supported each other in the long struggle for national independence and freedom.
    After shaking off the shackles of Western colonialism, the friendly relations between the people of China and Ceylon grew rapidly. In the past few years, although Ceylon and China have not established formal diplomatic relations, our two governments and peoples have maintained friendly contact and exchanges. As early as 1951, China and Ceylon began to have trade relations. In 1952, the Ceylonese government and the Chinese government formally signed a trade agreement exchanging rubber for rice. Until now, the two governments continue to sign trade agreements every year, and the trade volume increases year by year. Facts have proven that this equal and mutually beneficial trade relationship between China and Ceylon has brought great benefits to the lives of the people of both countries. Based on this friendly cooperation, China and Ceylon will soon exchange diplomatic envoys and formally establish diplomatic relations, which will undoubtedly promote the broader development of friendly cooperation between the two countries.
    In international affairs, China and Ceylon have the same views on many issues. Both of our countries have made many efforts to maintain peace, develop international friendly cooperation, and oppose colonialism. As a Colombo Conference country, Ceylon has made beneficial contributions to the realization of peace in Indochina and the convening of the Asian-African Conference. In particular, after the general election in Ceylon this year, the People's United Front led by Ceylon's Prime Minister Bandaranaike gained the support of the people and clearly proposed implementing an independent, peaceful, and neutral policy, not participating in military blocs, and establishing and developing friendly relations with all countries. This has rapidly increased Ceylon's prestige in the international community. Recently, Ceylon, together with India, the Soviet Union, Indonesia, and other countries, at the London conference discussing the Suez Canal issue, strongly supported the just actions of the Egyptian government and people in nationalizing the Suez Canal, which has won the sympathy and praise of world public opinion.
    In the short period of time, Ceylon's trade and friendly relations with various countries have developed extensively. Ceylon has signed trade agreements with Czechoslovakia, Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, and Hungary, and has obtained material and technical assistance from the Soviet Union, Poland, and Czechoslovakia without any political conditions. Before the Ceylonese government delegation came to China, it had already visited the Soviet Union. While negotiating the establishment of diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, it reached an agreement with the Soviet Union on expanding trade between the two countries. This far-sighted foreign policy implemented by the Ceylonese government has greatly promoted the independent development of Ceylon's economy and its friendly cooperation with other countries.
    The significance of the new development of relations between China and Ceylon is not limited to strengthening the friendly relations between the two countries, but also shows that the solidarity and cooperation between Asian countries is continuing to expand, and the friendship between countries is continuing to strengthen. This will have a profound impact on maintaining Asian and world peace and promoting the independent development of economic and cultural construction in various countries.

    祝贺中锡两国友好关系的新发展
    锡兰政府代表团和我国政府代表团，在我国首都北京经过友好和融洽的会谈，决定双方向各自的政府建议，一经作好必要的安排，两国就互派大使级的外交代表。两国政府代表团还就发展两国经济合作、贸易关系和加强文化交流达成了广泛的协议。从此，中锡两国人民的友谊进入了一个新时期，两国的友好合作将有着更广阔的前途。中国人民怀着喜悦的心情，祝贺中锡两国友好关系的新发展。
    中国人民和锡兰人民，一向有着传统的融洽的友好关系。中国和锡兰都是亚洲的文明古国，两国的国土之间虽然隔着高山和大海，但是两国人民之间的友谊从来不曾因此被隔断过。还在将近两千年以前，中国和锡兰在佛教、文化和贸易等方面就有了很密切的联系。在我国的史籍中，对中锡两国的友好关系有很多丰富而生动的记载。中锡两国人民之间从来没有过敌视和战争，只有互相信任和尊重。就是在近代，中国和锡兰虽然都遭到西方殖民主义的侵略和奴役，在我们两国人民之间设置了各种各样的障碍，但是，两国人民在长期争取民族独立和自由的斗争中，也始终是互相同情和互相支持的。
    在摆脱了西方殖民主义的束缚以后，我国和锡兰人民之间的友好关系就迅速增长。在过去几年中，锡兰和我国虽然没有建立正式的外交关系，但是我们两国政府和人民之间，一直保持着友好的接触和交往。早在1951年，我国和锡兰就开始有了贸易往来。在1952年，锡兰政府和我国政府就正式签订了以橡胶换大米的贸易协定。直到现在，两国政府每年都继续签订贸易协定，而且贸易额一年比一年增大。事实已经证明，我国和锡兰这种平等互利的贸易关系，给两国人民生活带来了极大的好处。在这一友好合作的基础上，我国和锡兰在不久以后互派外交使节并正式建立邦交，这无疑将促使两国的友好合作关系更广泛的发展。
    在国际事务中，我国和锡兰对许多问题有着相同的见解。我们两国都为维护和平，发展国际友好合作，反对殖民主义作了不少努力。锡兰作为科伦坡会议国家，对实现印度支那的和平，召开亚非国家会议，都曾作了有益的贡献。特别是锡兰在今年大选以后，锡兰总理班达拉奈克领导的人民联合阵线得到人民支持，明确地提出实行独立的和平中立政策，不参加军事集团，同一切国家建立和发展友好关系，这使锡兰在国际上的威望迅速增长。最近，锡兰同印度、苏联、印度尼西亚以及其他国家一道，在讨论苏彝士运河问题的伦敦会议上，有力地支持了埃及政府和人民把苏彝士运河国有化的正义行动，得到了世界舆论的同情和赞扬。
    在过去短短的时期中，锡兰同各国的贸易和友好关系有了广泛的发展。锡兰同捷克斯洛伐克、波兰、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、匈牙利都先后签订了贸易协定，并从苏联、波兰和捷克斯洛伐克获得了不附任何政治条件的物资和技术援助。锡兰政府代表团来我国以前已经访问了苏联，在同苏联谈判建交的同时，同苏联就扩大两国的贸易达成了协议。锡兰政府实行的这种具有远见的对外政策，大大地促进了锡兰经济的独立发展和同其他国家的友好合作关系。
    中锡两国关系的新发展的意义，决不限于加强两国之间的友好关系，并且表明了亚洲国家间的团结合作在继续扩大，各国之间的友谊在继续加强，这对维护亚洲和世界和平，促进各国经济文化建设的独立发展，都将产生深远的影响。
