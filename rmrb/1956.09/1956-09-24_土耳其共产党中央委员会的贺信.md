Dear Comrades,

The Central Committee of the Turkish Communist Party, with the utmost respect, congratulates our fraternal party, the Communist Party of China, on its Eighth National Congress. Our delegation extends the most sincere congratulations of the Turkish Communists and patriots to your party's congress.

For us, for our party, and for our people who are fighting against foreign enslavement and the shackles of American imperialism, it is of inestimable significance to attend your congress, to learn from the rich experience of struggle of your glorious party, to understand the new China that the great Chinese people are rebuilding, and to understand the steps you are taking on the road to building socialism.

Today, due to a handful of reactionaries implementing policies that harm our country, Turkey has fallen into the hands of Western imperialists and expansionist American colonialists. They have dragged Turkey into aggressive treaties and suppressed the will of the Turkish people. They are driving our country towards great danger. They are creating unfriendly relations between Turkey and its closest neighbors, and stirring up hatred between them. They are isolating us from those peoples and countries who are fighting for the cause of peace, democracy, and independence. They are attempting to exploit this isolation to achieve their shameful aims. For example, in today's Near East, in Egypt, those who are attempting to violate Egypt's sovereignty and create a dangerous situation are using Turkey as a tool to realize their aggressive policies and conspiracies.

These policies have plunged our country into political and economic collapse, and forced the people to bear the burden of huge military expenses that increase year by year.

The Turkish people hope to break this deadlock and break through this circle of isolation that separates them from the people of other countries. Like the people of all countries, our people hope to establish fraternal and friendly relations with the people of all countries, near and far. The path of friendship is the path of peace, the path of easing international tensions. Today, due to the policies of the Ankara government, a government that has no dignity to pursue an independent national policy, the Republic of Turkey has not yet established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China. This abnormal situation prevents close contact between the two peoples and prevents them from understanding each other. This abnormal situation hinders the development of friendship and also violates the interests of the Turkish people. Our people's struggle for national independence and democracy is closely linked to the cause of establishing friendship and good relations between countries.

Turkey is at one end of the East, and China is at the other. But there is a Turkish saying, "Hearts are connected." Your invitation to us to attend this congress of great historical significance shows that the hearts of our two peoples are indeed connected. Our party is very grateful for your attention to us. This shows that the Turkish Communists and patriots who are working under extremely difficult conditions and under the pressure of fascist terror, and the Turkish people who are fighting for their liberation, are not isolated. Many invincible and great friends are supporting them.

We wish the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China great success.

Long live peace and friendship between the peoples of all countries!

Long live the great People's Republic of China, the indestructible bastion of socialism, peace, and democracy in the Far East!

Long live the Communist Party of China!

### 土耳其共产党中央委员会的贺信

    土耳其共产党中央委员会的贺信亲爱的同志们：
    土耳其共产党中央委员会怀着十分尊敬的心情祝贺我们的兄弟党中国共产党的第八次代表大会。我们的代表团向你们党的代表大会转达土耳其共产党人和爱国者的最真诚的祝贺。
    我们来列席你们的代表大会，学习你们的光荣的党的丰富的斗争经验，来了解伟大的中国人民正在重新建设的新中国，了解你们在建设社会主义的道路上所采取的步骤，对于我们，对于我们的党，对于正在为反对外国的奴役和美帝国主义的枷锁而斗争的我国人民，具有无可估量的意义。
    今天，由于一小撮反动分子执行危害我们国家的政策，土耳其已经落入西方帝国主义者、进行扩张的美国殖民主义者的掌握中。他们把土耳其拖进侵略性的条约，并且压制土耳其人民的意志。他们驱使我国走向巨大的危险。他们在土耳其和它的最亲近的邻邦之间制造不友好的关系，在它们之间挑拨仇恨。他们把我们同那些为和平民主和独立的事业而奋斗的人民和国家隔离开来。他们企图利用这种隔绝的局面来达到他们的可耻的目的。例如，在今天的近东，在埃及，那些企图侵犯埃及的主权和制造危险局势的人，正在利用土耳其作为实现他们的侵略政策和阴谋的工具。
    这些政策使我国在政治上和经济上陷于崩溃，并且迫使人民负担逐年增加的庞大的军事费用。
    土耳其人民希望打开这种僵局，冲破把他们同其他国家的人民隔绝开来的这种孤立的圈子。像各国人民一样，我国人民希望同一切远近国家的人民建立兄弟友好的关系。友好的道路是和平的道路，是缓和国际紧张局势的道路。今天，由于安卡拉政府，这个毫无执行独立民族政策的尊严的政府的政策，土耳其共和国还没有和中华人民共和国建立外交关系，这种不正常的情况阻止了两国人民进行亲密的接触，使他们不能彼此了解。这种不正常的情况妨碍友谊的发展，同时也违反土耳其人民的利益。我国人民争取民族独立和民主的斗争，是同建立各国之间的友谊和良好关系的事业密切联系在一起的。
    土耳其在东方的一端，中国在东方的另一端。但是土耳其有一句俗话说，“人心是相通的”。你们邀请我们参加这次具有伟大历史意义的代表大会，这就表明我们两国人民的心的确是相通的。我们党十分感谢你们对我们的重视。这表明，在极端困难的条件下和在法西斯恐怖压力下进行工作的土耳其共产党人和爱国者，为争取自己的解放而斗争的土耳其人民，并不是孤立的。许多不可战胜的伟大的朋友在支持着他们。
    我们祝中国共产党第八次全国代表大会获得伟大的成就。
    和平和各国人民之间的友谊万岁！
    社会主义、和平和民主的不可摧毁的在远东的堡垒——伟大的中华人民共和国万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
            土耳其共产党中央委员会
                        一九五六年九月
