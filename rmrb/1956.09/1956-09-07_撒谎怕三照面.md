    Lying Fears Confrontation
    There is a Chinese saying: "Lying fears three confrontations." This saying means that a liar is most afraid of people understanding the truth and afraid of facing three-way cross-examination. Because once people see the facts, the liar's magic will be exposed, and their deception will no longer work.
    The U.S. State Department, recently disregarding the severe condemnation from U.S. newspapers and public opinion in other countries, has repeatedly prohibited U.S. citizens (including journalists) from visiting China, and the reason lies here.
    In order to create international tension and continue to pursue a policy of preparing for war, the U.S. ruling clique, led by Secretary of State Dulles, has manufactured, and is still continuing to manufacture, countless lying propaganda, obliterating the truth about New China, trying to make the American people believe it. However, people will wake up in the face of the facts. Therefore, the U.S. State Department is afraid of American journalists visiting China, which is also afraid of the American people knowing the real situation of New China. They deliberately put down an "iron curtain," cutting off the connection between the American people and the people of New China, so that the American propaganda machine can lie behind the "curtain" and continue to play the magic of lying and deceiving.

    撒谎怕三照面
    中国有句成语：“撒谎怕三照面”。这句话的意思是说，一个撒谎的人最害怕人们了解事情的真相，害怕三面对证。因为一旦人们面睹事实，撒谎人的魔术就会被戳穿，他们的骗局也就不灵了。
    美国国务院最近不顾美国国内各报纸和其他国家舆论的严厉谴责，三令五申地禁止美国公民（包括新闻记者）到中国来访问，道理也就在这里。
    美国统治集团为了制造国际紧张局势，继续奉行准备战争的政策，以国务卿杜勒斯为首的一班人马，曾经制造了、而且现在还在继续制造着车载斗量的撒谎宣传，抹煞新中国的真相，想叫美国人民相信。但是，人们在事实面前会醒悟过来的。因此，美国国务院害怕美国记者来中国访问，也就是害怕美国人民知道新中国的真实情况。他们故意放下“铁幕”，隔断美国人民和新中国人民的联系，以便于美国宣传机关躺在“幕”后，继续顽弄撒谎骗人的魔术。
