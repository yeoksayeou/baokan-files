Xinhua News Agency, Washington, September 1st—U.S. President Eisenhower, at a press conference held on August 31, explained the U.S. position that the Suez Canal is an "international waterway."

Eisenhower said that Egyptian President Nasser's protest against his statement on August 29 was a "misunderstanding" of the U.S. attitude. He said the U.S. did not mean that the 1888 treaty internationalized ownership of (the Suez Canal), but that the treaty gave the signatory countries the permanent right to use the canal. "According to the treaty, Egypt cannot, now or in the future, undermine this right of other countries. Therefore, in terms of using the canal, it is internationalized."

Eisenhower once again defended Dulles' plan for the "international control" of the Suez Canal and expressed hope that "all parties concerned" could accept the plan. He insisted that the Dulles plan "fully respects Egypt's sovereignty."

Eisenhower stated that the United States would not give up trying to seek a peaceful resolution, even if Egypt rejects the Western plan to be presented to Nasser in Cairo next Monday. When asked if Eisenhower believed that the recent military steps taken by Britain and France were proof of the Western countries' peaceful stance on resolving the Suez Canal issue, Eisenhower refused to answer the question.

Referring to the recent Soviet nuclear explosion tests, Eisenhower said that the Soviet Union conducted another nuclear explosion on August 30. This explosion was more powerful than the test a week earlier. The test a week earlier had the force of nearly one million tons of TNT. He said the Soviet Union conducted this test in the usual place – southwestern Siberia. Eisenhower avoided mentioning the fact that the United States stubbornly rejected the Soviet Union's repeated proposals to ban nuclear weapons and nuclear weapons testing, attempting to make people believe that the Soviet Union was talking about peace while continuing to test nuclear weapons.

In answering questions, Eisenhower said that the Soviet Union's recent nuclear tests would not cause any changes to the U.S. defense plans.

Eisenhower also spoke about the ban on American journalists visiting China. He stated that he would not agree to American journalists visiting China until Americans who have committed crimes and been sentenced in China are released, even though he believes there should be people-to-people exchanges and exchanges of information.

    艾森豪威尔谈苏彝士运河等问题
    再次替杜勒斯计划辩护
    新华社1日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔在8月31日举行的记者招待会上就美国认定苏彝士运河是一条“国际水道”的这种立场作了说明。
    艾森豪威尔说，埃及总统纳赛尔对他在8月29日发表的声明提出的抗议是“误解”了美国的态度。他说，美国的意思不是说，1888年条约把（苏彝士运河）所有权国际化了，但是，这个条约给予缔约国以使用运河的永久权利。“根据该条约，埃及现在或将来都不得破坏其他国家的这种权利。因此，从使用运河的意义上来说，它是国际化了的。”
    艾森豪威尔再次为杜勒斯的
  “国际管制”苏彝士运河计划辩护，并且表示希望“一切有关方面”能够接受这个计划。他硬说杜勒斯计划“完全尊重埃及的主权”。
    艾森豪威尔表示，美国不会放弃求得和平解决的尝试，即使埃及拒绝了将于下星期一在开罗向纳赛尔提出的西方计划。有人问，艾森豪威尔是否认为英法两国最近的军事步骤是西方国家在解决苏彝士运河问题上采取和平立场的证明，艾森豪威尔对这个问题拒绝作答。
    艾森豪威尔在谈到苏联最近的核子爆炸试验时说，苏联在8月30日又进行了一次核子爆炸。这次爆炸比一周前的试验威力更大。一周前的试验差不多有一百万吨三硝基甲苯的力量。他说，苏联在惯常的地方——西伯利亚的西南部进行了这一次爆炸试验。艾森豪威尔避而不提美国顽固地拒绝苏联一再提出的禁止核子武器与核子武器试验的建议的事实，企图叫人相信所谓苏联一面谈论和平，一面继续试验核子武器。
    艾森豪威尔在回答问题的时候说，苏联最近的核子试验不会使美国国防计划有任何改变。
    艾森豪威尔还谈到禁止美国记者访华的问题。他表示，只要在中国犯了罪而被判刑的美国人未被释放，他就不同意美国记者前往中国访问。虽然他相信应当有人们的往来，有交换情报。
