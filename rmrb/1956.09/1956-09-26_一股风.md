Title: A Gust of Wind

    Ignoring the target audience, disregarding the effect, and spouting endless nonsense – this is one manifestation of "eight-legged essays." This kind of eight-legged wind is blowing everywhere.
    A sewing machine advertisement was published in the newspaper. The advertisement first concocted a story about how Xiao Bao's mother wanted to buy a sewing machine. It started by introducing Xiao Bao's mother, saying she "is a skilled household manager..." and gradually developed from there, followed by a dialogue between two people. The story was almost eight hundred words long, and by the end, not only had Xiao Bao's mother not bought the sewing machine, but even the advantages of that type of sewing machine were not clearly stated. Aunt Zhang had to ask Xiao Bao's mother to go back and read the instruction manual. The advertisement then started anew, listing the "six major advantages." In this way, it used a total of one thousand three hundred and ninety-six words! However, the People's Daily editorial on the same day was only one thousand and twenty-nine words long.
    I recently paid attention to the tickets of six theaters in Beijing. These tickets contain a wide range of information, listing all the audience's notes, theater ticket inspection procedures, house rules, etc. It tells us that: "This ticket is limited to one person." It also tells us that: "Valid on the day of issue, invalid after the expiration date."... Only one ticket is bought, and two people cannot enter. Fearing that the audience will bring children, it has already been stipulated that "Children under three *chi* are not allowed to enter; children above three *chi* must purchase a ticket" (this is also printed on the ticket). Furthermore, buying a ticket means buying it for a specific performance, and the ticket is stamped with the date and time. Would anyone use a ticket for this performance to attend another performance? Just because some of this nonsense has to be written, these tiny pieces of paper, less than an inch high and less than three inches wide, must contain more than one hundred words (and that doesn't include the stub); one theater's ticket contains one hundred and eighteen words, only two words less than Du Fu's famous poem "The Recruiting Officer of Stone Moat", and thirty words more than Wang Anshi's essay "Reading the Biography of Lord Mengchang"!
    I have seen meal tickets from several agency canteens. In addition to printing the words "Meal Ticket of [Name of Agency] Canteen" and the value of the ticket, several notes are also printed on the ticket. Strangely, there is one such note in all of them: "This meal ticket is limited to use in this canteen and cannot be circulated as currency." Look, who would think that a meal ticket from Canteen A would be valid in Canteen B? In particular, who would think that a meal ticket could be circulated as currency?
    In this kind of eight-legged wind, how much time and energy do we waste in vain!

    一股风
    曲旅
    不看对象，不顾效果，废话连篇，这是“八股”的表现形式之一。这种八股风到处在吹。
    报上登了一个缝纫机的广告。广告里先编上一段故事，说小宝的妈妈想买一部缝纫机。话从介绍小宝的妈妈说起，说她“是一位管理家务的能手，……”就这样慢慢写来，底下是两个人的对话。故事写了差不多八百字，到末了，不但那个小宝的妈妈还没买缝纫机，连那种缝纫机的优点都没说清楚，张阿姨还得请小宝的妈妈回去看说明书。广告再往下另外起头，才列出那“六大优点”。这样，一共用了一千三百九十六个字之多！但是同一天的人民日报的社论只有一千零二十九个字。
    我最近留心了北京市六个戏场的戏票。这些戏票，内容包罗万象，凡观众注意事项、戏场验票手续、场内规则等等都一一列上了。它告诉我们说：“本券只限一人”。又告诉我们说：“当场有效，过期作废”。……票只买一张，两个人就进不去。怕观众带小孩吧，已经规定了“三市尺以下儿童谢绝入场；三市尺以上儿童一律购票”（这也印在戏票上）。再说，买戏票买的就是特定的那一场的，票面上也盖上了某日几点钟的印记，还会拿这一场的票去听另一场的戏吗？就因为这样一些废话要写上，这些高不到一寸、宽不到三寸的小小纸片要容纳的字数都达到一百以上（存根还在外）；有一个戏场的是一百一十八个字，比杜甫的有名的诗“石壕吏”只少两个字，比王安石的散文“读孟尝君传”还多三十个字！
    我看到好几个机关食堂的饭票。票面除印了某某机关食堂饭票字样及票面价值之外，还印了好几条注意事项。奇怪的是注意事项里都有这么一条：“本饭票只限本食堂使用，不作货币流通”。你看，谁会想甲机关食堂的饭票在乙机关食堂也有效呢？特别是，谁还会想饭票能够作货币流通呢？
    就在这种八股风里，我们白费了多少时间和精力！
