    The Deputy Director Who Restricts Love
    Xiang Zhong, the deputy director of the Changsha Workers' Cultural School of the First Ministry of Machine Building, has consistently restricted love affairs between students and teachers. He once publicly stated at a class teacher meeting: "Our school does not allow love. Those who are in love will be 'rectified'." One female student has already been driven to a state of mental disorder due to being "rectified" for being in love. However, this director still believes the "rectification" is not enough, and even ordered her to be carried to the auditorium on a stretcher for further "rectification."
    I believe that the deputy director has no right to interfere with or restrict love affairs. Gu Yunfeng

    限制恋爱的副教导主任
    第一机械工业部长沙职工文化学校副教导主任项忠，一向限制学生、教员恋爱。他曾经公开地在班主任会上说：“我们学校是不准恋爱的，恋爱就整”。一位女同学因为恋爱已经被“整”得神经失常了，可是，这位主任还认为“整”的不够，还叫用担架抬到礼堂上去“整”。
    我认为，副教导主任是没有权利来干涉和限制的。　顾云峰
