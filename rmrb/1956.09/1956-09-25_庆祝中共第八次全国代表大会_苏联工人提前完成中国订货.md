Xinhua News Agency, 24th: According to TASS reports: Soviet workers are striving to complete Chinese orders ahead of schedule to celebrate the convening of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China.

    Workers at an electrical factory in Vilnius, the capital of the Lithuanian Republic, completed this year's Chinese orders ahead of schedule to celebrate the opening of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China. On the eve of the opening of the Eighth National Congress, the last batch of welding machines and transformers, originally planned to be manufactured in the fourth quarter of this year, have been shipped from the distant western Soviet Union to China. Workers at the Lithuanian "Žalgiris" lathe factory are working hard to manufacture many lathes for China. A slogan in the assembly workshop reads: "We must deliver the lathes to the great Chinese people ahead of schedule!"

    Workers at the Novokramatorsk Machine-Building Plant in Elektrostal, near Moscow, warmly welcomed the news about the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China. Some time ago, the factory began manufacturing a huge forging press custom-made for China. Assemblers in Workshop No. 1 issued a call to all factory workers: "We must make this first-class machine ahead of schedule." This call received an enthusiastic response from all the workers in the factory. On the eve of the opening of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the installation workers assembled this machine for their Chinese friends. The first train carrying components of this machine has already departed.

    All employees of the Kazan Air Compressor Factory have always completed Chinese orders with great enthusiasm. To celebrate the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, they decided to manufacture nine air compressors ahead of schedule before the end of September this year and ship them to their Chinese friends.

    新华社24日讯　据塔斯社报道：苏联工人努力提前完成中国订货，来庆祝中国共产党第八次全国代表大会的举行。
    立陶宛共和国首都维尔纽斯的一个电气工厂的工人，为了庆祝中共第八次全国代表大会开幕，提前完成了今年全年的中国订货。在八大开幕前夕，原来计划在今年第四季度制成的最后一批焊接机和变压器，已经从遥远的苏联西部运去中国了。立陶宛“日阿尔基里斯”车床工厂的工人们正在努力为中国制造许多车床。装配车间的一幅标语上写着：“我们要提前把车床运给伟大的中国人民！”
    莫斯科近郊电钢城新克拉马托尔斯克机器制造厂的工人，热烈欢迎关于中共第八次代表大会的消息。前些日子，工厂开始制造中国订制的一台巨大的锻压机。一号车间装配工人向工厂全体工人发出了号召：“我们必须提前制好这台头等的机器”。这个号召得到了全厂工人热烈的响应。在中共第八次代表大会开幕前夕，安装工人为中国朋友装配好了这部机器。运送这部机器构件的头次列车已经出发了。
    喀山空气压缩机工厂的全体员工一向都怀着极大的热情来完成中国订货。为了庆祝中共第八次全国代表大会，他们决定在今年9月底以前提前制成九台空气压缩机，运给中国朋友们。
