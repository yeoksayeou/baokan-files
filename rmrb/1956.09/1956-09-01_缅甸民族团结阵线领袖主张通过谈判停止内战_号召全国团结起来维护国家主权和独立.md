Xinhua News Agency, Yangon, August 30th: The leader of the Burmese National United Front, U Aung Than, at the party's national representative conference on August 29th, demanded an end to the civil war through negotiation. He said that this is clearly the will of the people, because it is precisely because of this peaceful program that the Burmese National United Front received so much support from voters in the last general election.

U Aung Than is the elder brother of the late leader of the Burmese national independence movement, Aung San. In his speech, he emphasized that the whole country must unite to defend the country's sovereignty and maintain its independence. He said that history has fully proved that national disunity will lead to foreign aggression and rule. He said: "We must not forget that Burma was ruled by British imperialism for nearly a hundred years, precisely because court intrigues and treachery during the reign of several Burmese kings undermined national unity."

The morning session ended after U Aung Than's speech.

The entire afternoon session consisted of a political report by the General Secretary of the Burmese National United Front, Tekin Chit Maung, to the conference.

    缅甸民族团结阵线领袖主张通过谈判停止内战
    号召全国团结起来维护国家主权和独立
    据新华社仰光30日电　缅甸民族团结阵线领袖吴昂丹8月29日在这个党的全国代表会议上，要求通过谈判停止内战。他说，这显然是人民的意志，因为正是由于这种和平纲领，缅甸民族团结阵线才在上次大选中获得那么多的选民的支持。
    吴昂丹是已故的缅甸民族独立运动领袖昂山的哥哥。他在会上讲话时强调指出，全国必须团结起来，保卫国家的主权和维护它的独立。他说，历史已经充分证明，民族不团结就会招致外来的侵略和统治。他说：“我们不能忘记缅甸被英帝国主义统治将近一百年，这正是因为几个缅甸国王执政期间的宫廷阴谋和奸计破坏了民族团结。”
    上午会议在吴昂丹演说完毕以后结束。
    整个下午会议是由缅甸民族团结阵线总书记德钦漆貌向会议作缅甸民族团结阵线政治报告。
