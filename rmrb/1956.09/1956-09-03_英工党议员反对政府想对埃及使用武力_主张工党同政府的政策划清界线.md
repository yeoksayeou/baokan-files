Xinhua News Agency, London, September 2nd: According to TASS, London, September 2nd: British Labour MPs are expressing unease about the British ruling circles' attempt to adopt a "position of strength" policy towards Egypt.

    Labour MP Zilliacus said in a letter to "The Times": If we attempt to force Egypt by force to accept our views on its own rights and interests, then we will provoke opposition from all walks of life in the world and be branded with the irrefutable crime of aggression. Zilliacus pointed out that Britain's participation in military adventures in the Near East would have harmful consequences for Britain.

    According to the British United Press, three Labour MPs, Warbey, Brockway, and Davies, issued a statement on September 1st, pointing out that they had recently asked Foreign Secretary Lloyd to explain the British government's actions on the Suez Canal issue, but had not received a satisfactory reply. They believe that from the refusal to answer simple questions, people will inevitably draw certain conclusions.

    They said: "It should now be admitted that there is a great temptation to entice pilots and other technical experts to remain 'loyal' to the former Suez Canal Company, and the practice of enticing these experts is actually one form of using strength... There is also the impression that the government intends to use force if it cannot achieve its goals through other forms of pressure..."

    They also said: "Since the government is recklessly and stubbornly pursuing a flawed policy, the Labour Party must now clearly draw a line between itself and this policy, and speak on behalf of Britain – the real Britain, the sober, peace-loving Britain."

    Labour MP Callaghan said at a mass meeting in Loughborough (Leicestershire) on September 1st that the British ruling circles are "pushing the British people to the brink of war with Egypt." Callaghan also emphasized that if the British government takes this path, it will be met with "resistance not only from the Labour Party but also from conscious people in all parties," and that this resistance will be the most resolute.

    英工党议员反对政府想对埃及使用武力
    主张工党同政府的政策划清界线
    据新华社2日讯　据塔斯社伦敦2日讯：英国工党议员对英国统治集团企图对埃及采取“实力地位”政策表示不安。
    工党议员齐里亚库斯在写给“泰晤士报”的一封信中说：如果我们企图用武力强迫埃及接受我们对自己的权利和利益的看法，那么我们将惹起世界各阶层人士的反对，将被加上不可驳斥的侵略的罪名。齐里亚库斯指出，英国参加在近东的军事冒险会给英国带来有害的后果。
    据英国报联社报道，华贝、布罗克威和戴维斯等三个工党议员9月1日发表了声明，指出他们不久以前曾经请求外交大臣劳埃德解释英国政府在苏彝士运河问题上采取的行动，但是并没有得到满意的答复。他们认为，从拒绝答复简单的问题这一点，人们必然会得出某些结论。
    他们说：“现在应当承认，有人在百般引诱领航员和其他技术专家，使他们仍旧‘忠实’于前苏彝士运河公司，而引诱这些专家的做法其实是采用实力的形式之一……还有这么一种印象：政府打算采用武力，如果它不能靠其他形式的压力达到目的的话……”
    他们还说：“既然政府轻率而顽固地执行着一种有缺陷的政策，工党现在就要鲜明地同这一政策划清界线，并且代表英国——真正的英国，清醒的、渴望和平的英国——说话。”
    工党议员卡拉汗1日在琅玻罗城（勒斯忒郡）的群众集会上说，英国统治集团“在把英国人民推向同埃及作战的边缘”。卡拉汗并且强调指出，英国政府如果走这条路，那就会受到“不只是工党而且是一切政党中有觉悟的人的抵抗”，而这种抵抗将是最坚决的。
