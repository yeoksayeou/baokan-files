Xinhua News Agency, September 20th—Premier Zhou Enlai of the State Council said at the forty-sixth meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress today: The Chinese people cannot stand idly by to any action that infringes upon Egyptian sovereignty and carries out armed intervention against Egypt. The Chinese people stand firmly with the Egyptian people, together with all peace-loving and just people in the world. The Egyptian people will surely receive the full support of the Chinese people in their great struggle to safeguard national independence and state sovereignty.

Premier Zhou Enlai made a report on the Suez Canal issue at the meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress today. His report was met with warm applause.

Today, a delegation from the Parliament of the Republic of Indonesia was invited to attend the meeting. Also present at the meeting were deputies to the National People's Congress in Beijing and members of the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

After listening to Premier Zhou Enlai's report, the meeting discussed the Suez Canal issue and adopted Premier Zhou Enlai's report.

The following spoke at the meeting: Soong Ching Ling, Li Jishen, He Xiangning, Deng Chumin, Lai Ruoyu, Xu Guangping, Guo Moruo, Huang Yanpei, Shen Junru, Xu Deheng, Ma Yinchu, Zhang Bojun, Chen Qiyuan, Chen Qiyou, Ye Jianying, Liu Bocheng, Chen Shutong, Luo Longji, Zhou Jianren, Fu Zuoyi, Wei Lihuang, Zhang Xiruo, Burhan, Xie Xuehong, Wang Guangying, Chen Mingshu, and Hu Yaobang. They unanimously agreed with Premier Zhou Enlai's report, endorsed the statement of the People's Republic of China on the Suez Canal issue on August 15, and the Chinese government's reply to the Egyptian government on September 17. They also expressed firm support for Egypt's just actions to safeguard its sovereignty and independence.

Chairman Liu Shaoqi said at the end of the meeting: The meeting agrees with Premier Zhou Enlai's report; the Chinese government and people fully support the Egyptian government and people's actions to safeguard their sovereignty and independence.

Soong Ching Ling, Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, spoke first. She said that Egypt's measures regarding the Suez Canal symbolize the high tide of the struggle for national independence and anti-colonialism. She expressed support for the struggle of the Egyptian government and people to safeguard national sovereignty.

Speaking of the so-called "Users' Association" of the United States, Britain, and France, Soong Ching Ling said that this is just a new tactic in colonialist aggression. Scholars in the imperialist camp have long created a fallacy, saying that sacrificing national sovereignty to become a unified leadership organization can promote world justice and avoid war. In fact, this kind of institution that infringes upon national sovereignty is also a colonialist method. She said that this is an infringement on Egypt's dignity and sovereignty, and it is intolerable to the Egyptian people.

Soong Ching Ling quoted a letter from Sun Yat-sen to Inukai Tsuyoshi, then a Japanese minister, in 1923, to illustrate that the historical trend of national independence is irresistible. In that letter, Mr. Sun told Inukai Tsuyoshi: "After the European War, people in the oppressed parts of the world have become greatly enlightened and have risen up to resist the power of the strong. Most of these people are in Asia, so Asian nations have also felt this world trend and will inevitably rise up to resist the power of the European powers." But Inukai Tsuyoshi did not recognize this historical trend; Japanese imperialism failed less than twenty years later when it invaded the Asian continent and countries south of the continent. Soong Ching Ling said that now I observe the issue of Egypt, and I use the same words of Sun Yat-sen to say that all attempts that violate the demand for national independence are destined to suffer the same thorough failure, and the countries and people who take just actions to strive for national independence will definitely receive the enthusiastic support of the 600 million Chinese people and all peace-loving countries and people in the world, so it will definitely achieve the final victory.

Li Jishen, Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, said in his speech that the Suez Canal was excavated by the Egyptian people with their own blood and sweat on their own territory. The Egyptian government's nationalization of it is an action within its sovereign rights, and no country has any reason or right to interfere or oppose it. He said that we firmly oppose the war-provoking plan of the governments of the United States, Britain, and France to forcibly seize the Suez Canal, and we fully support the Egyptian people's struggle to safeguard national independence and state sovereignty.

Li Jishen said: Now, countries and people all over the world who advocate justice and love peace firmly stand by Egypt, and the colonialists are completely isolated. If they do not rein in their horses in time, abandon their military adventure policy, and take the path of peaceful negotiation, they will surely reap the bitter fruit; I believe that the Egyptian people's just struggle will surely be victorious.

He Xiangning, vice-chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, said the Chinese government, people and various democratic parties will resolutely support the just struggle of the Egyptian people. She said China had long suffered from imperialist oppression and the US imperialists still occupy our territory, Taiwan. In the common struggle against colonialism, the Chinese and Egyptian peoples shared the same suffering. He Xiangning then called on the democratic parties to follow Sun Yat-sen's instructions to "fight together with nations who treat us equally" and unite the oppressed nations of the world to smash the imperialist plot to undermine peace.

Deng Chumin, a member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said that the failure of the United States in the Korean War and France in Indochina proved that if they dared to take the risk of provoking a war in Egypt, they would inevitably suffer failure. Deng Chumin also said that the threats and intimidation of the United States, Britain, and France were bluffs and that the Egyptian people would be victorious with the support of the world's peaceful forces.

Lai Ruoyu, a member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, said in his speech that all Chinese workers, especially maritime workers, unanimously and resolutely supported the just struggle of the Egyptian people, and emphasized that the Suez Canal issue could only be resolved through peaceful negotiations. He said that the Chinese people and the people of the world stood on the side of the Egyptian people, and that the position of the United Kingdom, France, and the United States in attempting to blatantly infringe upon Egyptian sovereignty was completely isolated, even within their own countries.

Xu Guangping, a member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and Vice-Chairman of the All-China Women's Federation, said in her speech, first of all, on behalf of Chinese women, to the Egyptian brothers and sisters: Chinese women and mothers are their friends and supporters who can be completely relied upon in the just struggle. She said: The Egyptian people's nationalization of the Suez Canal, just like a heroic mother taking back her child from the hands of a robber, is completely reasonable and legal, and no one has the right to interfere with or obstruct it.

Huang Yanpei, Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and Chairman of the China Democratic National Construction Association, said that the so-called "Users' Association" plan proposed by the United Kingdom, France, and the United States, attempting to take over the Suez Canal by force, is a complete provocation. This kind of action that sacrifices the interests of the Egyptian people and their own people for the profit of a few capitalists is intolerable. Huang Yanpei said that colonialists have now become "rats crossing the street, everyone shouts to kill them." The Egyptian people are not isolated. Arab countries, Asian-African countries such as India and Indonesia, the Soviet Union and Eastern European people's democratic countries, and other peace-loving and anti-colonial countries and their people in the world all stand on the side of Egypt. If the United Kingdom, France, and the United States dare to provoke a war in Egypt, they will ultimately receive a shameful failure and demise.

Guo Moruo, Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, said that the Egyptian people's struggle is by no means an isolated struggle of a nation; it is a struggle of the entire world for peace and against war, a struggle against colonialism and colonialism. He said: The reason why the United Kingdom, France, and the United States have adopted various methods to threaten and oppress the Egyptian government and people is to suppress the flames of the world's anti-colonialist struggle. Guo Moruo emphasized: Today, we must break the threat of armed aggression with more resolute actions and stop the ferocity of imperialism.

Guo Moruo called on Chinese writers to take up their pens and throw themselves into the fiery struggle on the banks of the Nile to eulogize the heroic behavior of the Egyptian people in their anti-colonial struggle. He also called on Chinese science and technology workers to help the Egyptian people in their construction with the enthusiasm of building their own Yangtze River Bridge and Yellow River hydropower station. Guo Moruo finally said passionately that in the event that imperialism ignores the warnings of the people of the world and launches a war, he is willing to go to Egypt as a "volunteer."

Shen Junruo, Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and Chairman of the China Democracy League, said that the blood in his heart was boiling and he could not help but say a few words. He said that the series of unreasonable actions of the imperialists in infringing upon Egyptian sovereignty aroused his irrepressible anger. He pointed out that the Egyptian people's anti-colonialist struggle had received the enthusiastic support of the Chinese people and peace-loving people all over the world, their struggle would surely be victorious, and the imperialists' unreasonable acts of infringing upon the sovereignty of other countries were doomed to suffer a shameful failure.

Xu Deheng, a member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and Chairman of the Jiusan Society, said: Since the Bandung Conference, the movement for national independence and anti-colonialism has formed an irresistible force for the oppressed people of the world, especially the people of Asian and African countries, to control their own destiny. However, the United Kingdom, the United States, and France are attempting to use the canal issue to cruelly plunder and oppress the Egyptian people. The aggressive atrocities of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France are not only a provocation to the Egyptian people, but also to the entire Arab world and all peace-loving and just countries. The Chinese people oppose this provocative behavior of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France with unparalleled anger.

Ma Yinchu, a member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said: The United Kingdom, France, and the United States forced Egypt to accept the "Dulles Plan," which infringed upon Egyptian sovereignty, and also announced the organization of a canal "Users' Association" in an attempt to forcibly take over the Suez Canal. This series of barbaric and unreasonable behaviors has been opposed by peace-loving people all over the world. He said that it is a matter of course for the Egyptian government to exercise its sovereignty in its territory. Justice belongs to the Egyptian people, and the Egyptian people will surely win.

Zhang Bojun, Vice-Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Chairman of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, and Minister of Communications, pointed out that if the "Users' Association" plan under the planning of the United States is realized, it will condone colonialists to arbitrarily infringe upon the sovereignty of other countries at any time. Zhang Bojun said that the Chinese people support the just struggle of the Egyptian people, and that many sailors have already applied to go to Egypt to participate in the piloting work of the Suez Canal.

Chen Qiyuan, a member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, representing patriotic overseas Chinese, supported the Egyptian people's struggle to safeguard sovereignty and national dignity. He said: We overseas Chinese express our infinite sympathy and respect for the Egyptian people's heroic anti-colonialist struggle today, and express our extraordinary indignation and hatred for the rampant and overbearing behavior of the British, French, and American colonialists. The millions of patriotic overseas Chinese are friends of Egypt, and will resolutely support our country's statement on the Suez Canal issue, and will also fully support the just struggle of the Egyptian people.

Chen Qiyou, a member of the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and Chairman of the China Zhi Gong Party, said: In China's past history, there have been similar encounters to Egypt today. The Chinese people are very aware of the situation of the Egyptian people and will therefore definitely support this just action of the Egyptian people to the end. He said, I believe that our millions of overseas compatriots will definitely stand firmly on the side of Egypt, support the Egyptian people's just struggle, and smash the aggressors' war conspiracy.

Marshal Ye Jianying, a member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and Vice-Chairman of the National Defense Commission, condemned the imperialists for continuing to flex their muscles in the Mediterranean Sea near the canal zone, carrying out various military threats, and attempting to rob the canal with adventurous plans. He said that before the Northern Expedition, when putting down Chen Jiongming's rebellion, Sun Yat-sen personally led five warships including the Yongfeng to advance from Huangpu to Guangzhou in order to support the Shaoguan battle. The British imperialist consul-general stationed in Shamian, representing the opinions of all imperialists, publicly put forward a tough and threatening statement saying that only if we withdrew from the Pearl River could we guarantee the lives and property of foreign people in Shamian, as well as the safety of international navigation in Guangzhou and Hong Kong. Mr. Sun righteously refuted them at the time, saying: "The Pearl River is a river in Chinese territory, and I have complete freedom of action." Our five warships persisted in Baietantum for more than two months until the end. This fact shows that the strength of the Guangzhou revolutionary regime at that time was still very small and the pressure of imperialism was very great, but as long as we believe that our cause is just, as long as we can persist in the just struggle, the threat of imperialism is not terrible. Almost thirty years later, the entire world situation has undergone fundamental changes. Although the conditions for Egypt's struggle today still have many difficulties, they are more favorable by comparison. The Egyptian people are brave and strong. I believe that the various threats already adopted by the British, French, and American imperialists cannot frighten the Egyptian people.

Marshal Ye Jianying used the examples of the United States being defeated in Korea, Britain in Malaya, and France in Indochina, to warn the colonialists to be clearer-headed and more realistic. He also specifically reminded the British and French governments that if they must use force to rob the canal, they will inevitably push themselves onto an irretrievably dangerous path, and that such a result is exactly what the US imperialists want.

Marshal Liu Bocheng, a member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and Vice-Chairman of the National Defense Commission, said that the military threats of certain Western countries are not only a provocation to Egypt and the Arab countries and people, but also a provocation to all peace-loving countries and people. The problem now is not only to defend Egyptian sovereignty, but also to oppose imperialist aggression and repel the threat of war to defend world peace.

Marshal Liu Bocheng said that the Chinese people know from their own personal experience that imperialists are not scary; only by repelling provocations can we uphold justice; only by resisting aggression can we maintain peace. The Chinese people sincerely sympathize with and do their best to support the heroic struggle of the Egyptian people, and resolutely oppose any attempt to infringe upon Egyptian sovereignty and carry out armed intervention in Egypt.

Chen Shu-tong, Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and Director of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, pointed out that the Suez Canal issue is a matter of the struggle between colonialism and anti-colonialism. It is not a matter for Egypt alone, but a common issue for all countries suffering from the disaster of colonialism. It is an issue that peace-loving people around the world should join this struggle. Chen Shu-tung expressed his sympathy for Egypt's just struggle to maintain sovereignty, and condemned the United Kingdom, France, and the United States for exerting economic pressure and military threats on Egypt, attempting to achieve their colonialist conspiracy through the "Users' Association" plan.

Luo Longji, a member of the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and Vice-Chairman of the China Democratic League, pointed out in his speech that if the United Kingdom, France, and the United States dare to act rashly and carry out military aggression, what awaits them will be a bloody nose and a complete and disastrous defeat. Luo Longji said that we, the 600 million Chinese people, should do everything possible, use our material strength, and be prepared to support the Egyptian people's just struggle with concrete volunteer actions at any time. The strength of the Egyptian people, the entire Arab nation, the entire Asian-African people, and the peace-loving people of the world will surely be able to defeat the aggressive conspiracy of the three imperialist powers, the United Kingdom, France, and the United States, and completely defeat them.

Zhou Jianren, a member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Conference, said that 600 million Chinese people are closely following the serious situation created in the Suez Canal area by imperialist provocation. He warned the imperialists that when waving their knives and guns, they should remember the lessons of the Korean War, Vietnam, Malaya, and Algeria. He particularly pointed out that the governments of the United Kingdom and France should know that it is not good to get chestnuts out of the fire for others.

Fu Zuoyi, a member of the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and Minister of Water Resources, said that the colonialists believe that the Suez Canal is an important link, and therefore they will never let go of their sinful and bloody hands, and they want to use it to demonstrate to the oppressed people of the world. He said that the threat of war cannot scare the Egyptian people. For the sake of national independence and sovereign integrity, the Egyptian people have declared their great determination to spare no sacrifice. He said that the victory or defeat of a war does not depend on the strength or size of the military, but on whether the war is just, and on the unyielding and unyielding will of the broad masses of people to demand independence and freedom. The era of using threats, massacres, and suppression of colonial people is long gone.

Wei Lihuang, a member of the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, said that the actions of the United Kingdom, France, and the United States in attempting to establish a "Users' Association" and the United Kingdom and France in gathering troops in Cyprus to carry out armed provocations have aroused the opposition of peace-loving people all over the world. He said that the Chinese people, who are building their own better lives, love peace, but they are not afraid of war. He warned the imperialists to "be clearer-headed and calmer." He said: "I studied infantry. If necessary, I am willing to be an old volunteer to support Egypt."

Zhang Xiruo, a member of the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and President of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, said that the United Kingdom, France, and their close partner the United States, have used all despicable, rogue, vulgar, and ridiculous means on the Suez Canal issue to try to save what cannot be saved. When they have no way to think and no plan to implement, they will not give up. There is a saying in China: "One will not give up until one sees the Yellow River," and these imperialists can be said to be "still unwilling to give up even after seeing the Yellow River." However, all peace-loving and just countries and people in the world firmly stand by Egypt. Then, even if someone must risk the world's condemnation and take risks, it is nothing more than a "suicidal" act. He said: "We can only advise people not to hang themselves, but if he insists on hanging himself, what can you do!"

Burhan, head of the Chinese Islamic Hajj delegation recently returned from Egypt, head of the Chinese cultural delegation to Egypt, and Vice-Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, said that he saw in Egypt that under the leadership of President Nasser, the Egyptian people showed unshakable and unprecedented unity when they nationalized the Suez Canal Company. He said that the Egyptian people will never yield to any foreign force, and that the Suez Canal issue can only be resolved through peaceful negotiations. Burhan said that once imperialism truly launches a war of aggression against Egypt, he will take his two children to fight for Egypt's independence and freedom.

Xie Xuehong, a member of the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and Chairman of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League, said in her speech: The Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League, together with other democratic parties and the people of the whole country, resolutely supports the just position taken by our government on the Suez Canal issue. The Chinese people have always loved peace and opposed war, so we fully support this just struggle of the Egyptian people, just as the people of the world support our just struggle to liberate Taiwan.

Wang Guangying, who recently returned from Egypt, introduced at the meeting the unparalleled enthusiasm he had personally seen in Egypt during his more than 20 days in Egypt, where the Egyptian people were united from top to bottom to oppose imperialism. He said that the Egyptian people, who had built the Suez Canal with the bones of 120,000 people, would never allow anyone to infringe upon their sovereignty.

Chen Mingshu, a member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, pointed out in his speech that without the support of the United States, the United Kingdom and France would not dare to continue to persist in their arrogant attempts that violate justice and infringe upon the sovereignty of other countries, and the reason why the United States supports them is to take the opportunity to seize the colonial position of the United Kingdom and France in the Middle East and replace them. Chen Mingshu said that no matter how things evolve, whether victory goes to Egypt or the issue is dragged on for a long time, it can be asserted that the conspiracy of the United Kingdom, France, and the United States will end in failure.

Hu Yaobang, a member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and Secretary of the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, said that the liberated Chinese youth have the greatest enthusiasm and greatest courage for two things: one is to build the motherland, and the other is to oppose colonialism. Premier Zhou's statement that the Chinese people fully support the Egyptian people fully expresses the wishes of Chinese youth. We Chinese youth never want war. But if imperialism insists on seeking its own demise, then the Chinese youth, who have been fully tested by war, will surely bravely and unreservedly bury the creators of war in the tomb together with the people and youth of the world.

Wang Kunlun, a member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, also recited a poem at the meeting to express support for the Egyptian people's struggle to safeguard sovereignty and independence. The poem said: "The waves of the Suez River are surging, who in the world can watch from the other side, the rulers and the pen move together, striving to follow Elder Guo to steer the sailing ship."

    全国人民代表大会常委会通过关于苏彝士运河问题报告
    中国人民全力支持埃及的斗争
    对任何侵犯埃及主权和武装干涉的行动都不能置若罔闻
    新华社20日讯　国务院总理周恩来今天在全国人民代表大会常务委员会第四十六次会议上说：任何侵犯埃及主权和对于埃及实行武装干涉的行动，中国人民都不能置若罔闻。中国人民同全世界一切爱好和平和正义的人民一起，坚决地站在埃及人民这一边。埃及人民在维护民族独立和国家主权的伟大斗争中定会得到中国人民的全力支持。
    周恩来总理今天在全国人民代表大会常务委员会会议上作了关于苏彝士运河问题的报告。他的报告引起了热烈的掌声。
    今天，印度尼西亚共和国国会代表团应邀列席了这个会议。列席这次会议的还有在京的全国人民代表大会代表和中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会常务委员。
    会议在听取了周恩来总理的报告后，就苏彝士运河问题进行了讨论，并且通过了周恩来总理的报告。
    在会上发言的有：宋庆龄、李济深、何香凝、邓初民、赖若愚、许广平、郭沫若、黄炎培、沈钧儒、许德珩、马寅初、章伯钧、陈其瑗、陈其尤、叶剑英、刘伯承、陈叔通、罗隆基、周建人、傅作义、卫立煌、张奚若、鲍尔汉、谢雪红、王光英、陈铭枢、胡耀邦。他们一致同意周恩来总理的报告，拥护8月15日中华人民共和国关于苏彝士运河问题的声明和9月17日中国政府给埃及政府的复照，并且对埃及为维护自己的主权和独立而采取的正义行动表示坚决支持。
    刘少奇委员长在会议结束时说：会议同意周恩来总理的报告；中国政府和人民全力支持埃及政府和人民维护他们主权和独立的行动。
    全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长宋庆龄首先发言。她说，埃及对苏彝士运河的措施，象征着民族独立和反殖民主义斗争的高潮。她表示支持埃及政府和人民为维护国家主权而进行的斗争。
    宋庆龄在谈到美、英、法三国的所谓“使用国协会”时说，这不过是殖民主义侵略中的一个新的策略。帝国主义方面的学者早就创造一种谬论，说牺牲国家主权成为一个统一领导的组织，才能发扬世界正义，才能避免战争。实际上，这种侵犯国家主权的机构也是一种殖民主义的办法。她说，这是对埃及的尊严和主权的侵犯，是埃及人民所不能容忍的。
    宋庆龄引用孙中山先生在1923年给当时日本的一位大臣犬养毅的一封信，说明民族独立的历史潮流是不可抗拒的。在那封信里，孙先生告诉犬养毅说：“欧战而后，受屈部分之人感得大觉悟，群起而抵抗强权。此部分人类以亚洲为最多，故亚洲民族亦感此世界潮流，将必起而抵抗欧洲强权也”。但是犬养毅并没有认识这一历史潮流；日本帝国主义不到二十年后就在侵略亚洲大陆和大陆以南的一些国家时遭到失败。宋庆龄说，现在我观察关于埃及的问题，同样用孙中山这一段话来说，凡是违背民族独立要求的一切企图，都是注定要遭到同样彻底失败的，而争取民族独立的正义行动的国家和人民，一定会得到六亿中国人民和全世界一切爱好和平的国家和人民的热烈支持，因此它一定会取得最后的胜利。
    全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长、中国国民党革命委员会主席李济深发言时说，苏彝士运河是埃及人民用自己的血汗在自己的领土上开凿出来的，埃及政府把它收归国有，是主权范围内的行动，任何国家都没有理由和权利加以干涉和反对。他说，我们坚决反对美、英、法三国政府企图强夺苏彝士运河的战争挑衅计划，我们全力支持埃及人民维护民族独立和国家主权的斗争。
    李济深说：现在，全世界主张正义、爱好和平的国家和人民都坚决站在埃及一边，殖民主义者是完全处在孤立的地位，如果他们不及时悬崖勒马，放弃军事冒险政策，走和平协商的道路，他们必将自食其果；我相信埃及人民的正义斗争一定会胜利的。
    中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会副主席何香凝说，中国政府、人民和各民主党派将义不容辞地坚决支援埃及人民的正义斗争。她说，中国曾经长期遭受帝国主义的压迫，至今美帝国主义仍然侵占着我国领土台湾，在共同反对殖民主义的斗争中，中国人民和埃及人民有着“同病相怜”的关系。何香凝接着号召各民主党派要遵循孙中山先生“以平等待我之民族共同奋斗”的遗训，联合全世界被压迫的民族，粉碎帝国主义破坏和平的阴谋。
    全国人民代表大会常务委员会委员邓初民说，美国在朝鲜、法国在印度支那的侵略战争中的失败，证明它们如果敢于在埃及冒险挑起战争，必然会遭到失败。邓初民又说，英、法、美三国的威胁和恫吓是虚张声势的，埃及人民有全世界和平力量的支持，一定会胜利。
    全国人民代表大会常务委员会委员、中华全国总工会主席赖若愚在讲话中表示全中国工人、特别是海员工人，都一致坚决支持埃及人民的正义斗争，并着重指出苏彝士运河问题只有采取和平协商的办法才能得到解决。他说中国人民和全世界人民都站在埃及人民这一边，英、法、美企图蛮横地侵犯埃及主权的立场是完全孤立的，即使在这些国家本国内也是孤立的。
    全国人民代表大会常务委员会委员、中华全国民主妇女联合会副主席许广平在发言时首先代表中国妇女向埃及的兄弟姊妹们表示：中国的妇女和母亲，是他们在正义斗争中完全可以依赖的朋友和支持者。她说：埃及人民把苏彝士运河收归国有，正像一个英勇的母亲从强盗的手里夺回自己的孩子一样，是完全合理合法的，任何人无权加以干涉和阻挠。
    全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长、中国民主建国会主任委员黄炎培说，英、法、美三国提出叫做“使用国协会”计划，企图用武力接管苏彝士运河是十足的挑衅行动，这种为了少数资本家的利润，不惜把战争强加在埃及人民和本国人民的头上的行动，是令人不能容忍的。黄炎培说，殖民主义者现在已成为“老鼠过街，人人喊打”。埃及人民不是孤立的，阿拉伯国家，印度、印度尼西亚等亚非国家，苏联和东欧人民民主国家，以及世界上其他爱好和平反对殖民主义的国家和这些国家的人民都站在埃及这一边，英、法、美三国如果敢于在埃及挑起战争，最后所得到的将是可耻的失败和灭亡。
    全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长、中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主席郭沫若说：埃及人民的斗争决不是一个民族的孤立的斗争，它是整个世界和平与战争的斗争，是反殖民主义与殖民主义的斗争。他说：英、法、美之所以采取各种办法威胁和压迫埃及政府与人民，其目的就是要镇压世界人民反殖民主义的烽火。郭沫若强调指出：今天我们必须以更加坚决的行动击破武装侵略的威胁，制止帝国主义的凶焰。
    郭沫若号召中国作家拿起他们的笔杆投入尼罗河畔的火热斗争，去歌颂埃及人民反殖民主义斗争的英雄行为。他并号召中国科学技术工作者以建立自己的长江大桥和黄河水电站的热情，帮助埃及人民进行建设。郭沫若最后激昂地说，万一帝国主义不顾世界人民的警告而掀起战争，他愿意作为一个“志愿军”到埃及去。
    全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长、中国民主同盟主席沈钧儒说，他心里的血沸腾着，压抑不住要说几句话。他说帝国主义者在侵犯埃及主权上的一系列无理行为激起了他不可抑制的愤怒。他指出，埃及人民反殖民主义的斗争已经得到中国人民和全世界爱好和平人民的热烈支持，他们的斗争一定会胜利，帝国主义者无理侵犯别国主权的行为注定要遭到可耻的失败。
    全国人民代表大会常务委员会委员、九三学社主席许德珩说：民族独立和反殖民主义运动，自万隆会议以来，已经形成了全世界被压迫人民尤其是亚非国家的人民掌握自己的命运的不可抗拒的力量。但是英、美、法三国却企图利用运河问题对埃及人民进行残酷的掠夺和压迫。英、美、法三国的这种侵略暴行，不但是对埃及人民的挑衅，而且也是对整个阿拉伯国家以及一切爱好和平和正义的国家的挑衅。中国人民以无比愤怒的心情，反对英美法三国的这种挑衅行为。
    全国人民代表大会常务委员会委员马寅初说：英、法、美三国迫使埃及接受侵犯埃及主权的“杜勒斯计划”，并且还宣布要组织运河
  “使用国协会”，企图强行接管苏彝士运河，这一系列的蛮横的无理行为，遭到全世界爱好和平的人民的反对。他说，埃及政府在它的领土上行使它的主权，这是天经地义的事情。正义是属于埃及人民的，埃及人民一定会胜利。
    中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会副主席、中国农工民主党主席、交通部部长章伯钧指出美国策划下的“使用国协会”计划如果得到实现，就将纵容殖民主义者可以随时任意侵犯其他国家的主权。章伯钧说，中国人民是支持埃及人民这一正义斗争的，现在已经有许多海员申请前去埃及参加苏彝士运河的领航工作。
    全国人民代表大会常务委员会委员陈其瑗代表国外爱国华侨支持埃及人民维护主权和国家尊严的斗争，他说：我们华侨对于埃及人民今天英勇的反殖民主义斗争表示无限的同情和敬意，对于英、法、美殖民主义者的横行霸道表示异常愤慨和仇恨。国外千百万爱国华侨是埃及的朋友，必将坚决拥护祖国关于苏彝士运河问题的声明，也必将以全力支持埃及人民的正义斗争。
    中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会常务委员、中国致公党主席陈其尤说：在中国过去的历史上，曾经有过同今天埃及相类似的遭遇，中国人民是十分了解埃及人民的处境的，因而对埃及人民这一正义行动一定支援到底。他说，我相信，我们千百万海外侨胞，一定会坚决地站在埃及一边，支援埃及人民的正义斗争，粉碎侵略者的战争阴谋。
    全国人民代表大会常务委员会委员、国防委员会副主席叶剑英元帅在发言时谴责了帝国主义者继续在靠近运河区的地中海耀武扬威，进行各种军事威胁，企图劫夺运河的冒险计划。他说，在北伐战争前戡平陈炯明叛乱时，孙中山先生为了支援韶关战斗，亲率永丰等五艘军舰，由黄埔向广州推进。英帝国主义驻沙面的总领事代表各帝国主义的意见，以强硬并威胁的形式公开的提出说，只有我们退出珠江，才能保障沙面的外国人民的生命财产，以及保障广州、香港国际航行的安全。孙先生当时正义的驳斥他们说：“珠江是中国领土的河川，我完全有行动的自由。”我们五艘军舰，在白鹅潭坚持了两个多月直到最后。这一件事实说明了当时的广州革命政权力量还是很小的，帝国主义的压力是很大的，但是，只要我们相信自己的事业是正义的，只要我们能够坚持正义的斗争，帝国主义的威胁是不可怕的。在将近三十年以后的现在，整个世界局势已发生根本变化，埃及今天的斗争条件虽然还有很多困难，可是比较起来已经有利得多了。埃及人民是勇敢的坚强的，我相信英法美帝国主义者所已经采用的各种威胁绝不能吓倒埃及人民。
    叶剑英元帅以美国在朝鲜，英国在马来亚和法国在印度支那所进行的战争遭到失败的事例，警告殖民主义者要清醒一点、现实一点。他还特别提醒英、法政府，如果他们一定要用武力劫夺运河，就必然会把自己推上不可收拾的危险道路，而这样的结果正是美帝国主义者所希望的。
    全国人民代表大会常务委员会委员、国防委员会副主席刘伯承元帅说，某些西方国家的武力威胁，不仅是对埃及和阿拉伯国家和人民的挑衅，而且也是对一切爱好和平的国家和人民的挑衅。现在的问题不仅仅是保卫埃及主权的问题，而且也是反对帝国主义侵略和击退战争威胁来保卫世界和平的问题。
    刘伯承元帅说，中国人民从自己的切身经验中知道，帝国主义者是并不可怕的；只有打退挑衅，才能伸张正义；只有反抗侵略，才能保持和平。中国人民衷心同情和尽力支持埃及人民的英勇斗争，坚决反对任何侵犯埃及主权和对埃及进行武装干涉的企图。
    全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长、中华全国工商业联合会主任委员陈叔通指出，苏彝士运河问题是殖民主义与反殖民主义斗争的问题，不是埃及一国的问题而是所有受殖民主义灾害的国家的共同问题，是全世界爱好和平的人民应该加入这个斗争的问题。陈叔通对埃及维护主权的正义斗争表示同情，并且谴责英、法、美三国对埃及施加经济压力和武力威胁，企图以“使用国协会”计划来达到殖民主义的阴谋。
    中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会常务委员、中国民主同盟副主席罗隆基在他的讲话中指出，英、法、美三国如果敢于轻举妄动进行军事侵略，等待它们的将是头破血流、彻底惨败的结局。罗隆基说，我们中国六万万人民应该用尽一切可能，用我们的物质力量，并且随时准备用志愿的具体行动来支持埃及人民这个正义的斗争。埃及人民、整个阿拉伯民族、整个亚非的人民同全世界爱好和平的人民的力量，必定能够击败英、法、美三个帝国主义的侵略阴谋，使他们彻底失败。
    全国人民代表大会常务委员会委员、中国民主促进会副主席周建人说，六亿中国人民正密切注意由于帝国主义挑衅而在苏彝士运河地区造成的严重局势。他警告帝国主义者在挥舞刀枪的时候，应该记取朝鲜战争、越南、马来亚和阿尔及利亚的教训。他特别指出英法两国政府应该知道为别人火中取栗是不会有好结果的。
    中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会常务委员、水利部部长傅作义说，殖民主义者认为苏彝士运河是一个重要环节，因而死不放松罪恶血手，要对全世界被压迫的人民借以示威。他说，战争威胁吓不倒埃及人民，为了民族独立和主权完整，埃及人民已经宣示了自己不惜一切牺牲的重大的决心。他说，战争胜负不取决于武力强弱和大小，而取决于战争是否正义，取决于广大人民的不屈不挠的要求独立自由的坚强意志，用威胁、屠杀镇压殖民地人民的时代早已一去不复返了。
    中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会常务委员卫立煌说，英、法、美企图建立“使用国协会”，和英、法两国在塞浦路斯集结军队进行武装挑衅的行动，引起了全世界爱好和平人民的反对。他说，正在建设自己美好生活的中国人民热爱和平，但也不怕战争。他警告帝国主义者，“头脑应该清醒些、冷静点。”他说：“我是学步兵的，如果有必要愿作一个志愿老兵去支援埃及。”
    中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会常务委员、中国人民外交学会会长张奚若说，英、法两国和它们的亲密伙伴美国对于苏彝士运河问题，用尽一切卑鄙、无赖、下流、可笑的手段，想挽救那不可挽救的东西。他们在无法可想无计可施的时候，还是不会死心的。中国有句俗话：“不到黄河心不死”，这些帝国主义者可以说是“到了黄河心还不死”。不过全世界爱好和平和正义的国家和人民都坚决地站在埃及一边。那么，就是有人一定要甘冒不韪铤而走险，那也不过是一种
  “自寻短见”的作法而已。他说：“我们只能劝人不上吊，不过假如他一定要上，你又有什么办法呢！”
    新近由埃及回国的中国伊斯兰教朝觐团团长、中国赴埃及文化代表团团长、中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会副主席鲍尔汉说，我在埃及看到了埃及人民在纳赛尔总统领导下实现苏彝士运河公司国有化时，表现了不可动摇的空前团结。他说，埃及人民是决不会屈服于任何外来武力的，苏彝士运河问题只有通过和平协商才能解决。鲍尔汉表示，一旦帝国主义真正掀起侵略埃及的战争，他将带着他的两个孩子去为埃及的独立自由而斗争。
    中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会常务委员、台湾民主自治同盟主席谢雪红在会上发言，她说：台湾民主自治同盟同其他民主党派和全国人民一道，坚决拥护我国政府在苏彝士运河问题上采取的严正立场。中国人民一贯爱好和平反对战争，因此我们完全支持埃及人民这个正义的斗争，就像全世界人民支持我们解放台湾的正义斗争一样。
    新近从埃及回国的王光英在会上介绍了他在埃及二十多天中亲眼看到的埃及人民上下团结一致反对帝国主义的无比热情，他说，曾经以十二万人的白骨建设起苏彝士运河的埃及人民是决不容许任何人侵犯他们的主权的。
    全国人民代表大会常务委员会委员陈铭枢在发言中指出，英、法如果没有美国的撑腰，是不敢继续坚持其违背正义和侵犯他国主权的狂妄企图的，而美国之所以为它们撑腰，就是为了乘机攫取英、法在中东殖民的地位而代之。陈铭枢说，不论事情的演变怎样，或者是急转直下胜利归于埃及，或者旷日持久地把问题拖下去，可以断言，英、法、美的阴谋都将以失败而告终。
    全国人民代表大会常务委员会委员、中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会书记胡耀邦发言说，解放了的中国青年对这样两件事有最大的热情和最大的勇气，一件是建设祖国，一件是反对殖民主义。周总理所说的中国人民全力支持埃及人民的声明，完全表达了中国青年的愿望。我们中国青年绝不希望战争。但帝国主义硬要自找灭亡，那么，已经经过战争充分考验了的中国青年，一定会勇敢地毫无保留地同全世界人民和青年一起，把战争的制造者埋到坟墓中去。
    全国人民代表大会常务委员会委员王昆仑还在会上作了一首诗，表示对埃及人民维护主权独立斗争的支持。这首诗说：“苏彝河浪怒滔天，举世谁能隔岸观，曲尺笔锋齐抖擞，争随郭老驾征帆。”
