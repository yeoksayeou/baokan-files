Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, August 31st. The Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Hebei Provincial People's Committee jointly convened a provincial production and disaster relief, autumn harvest distribution conference. After four days of discussion on the provincial production and disaster relief plan, it closed on the 30th. All the cadres participating in the meeting, through accounting and exchanging experiences in production and disaster relief, not only further laid the foundation for confidence in overcoming the disaster, but also had specific methods for organizing production for self-salvation.

At the beginning of the meeting, not all leading cadres from various counties and responsible cadres from economic departments had a sense of “bottom line” regarding successfully weathering the disaster. However, after everyone compared the central government's allocated relief funds, loans, raw materials for sideline occupations, and work-for-relief investments with the needs of disaster victims for surviving the famine, they found that the conditions for successfully weathering the disaster were fully present. For example, a rough calculation in the Baoding area showed that the food needs of people and animals in disaster areas and the subsidies for repairing houses would total approximately more than 30 million yuan this winter in four months. The relief funds and loans allocated by the state, the income disaster victims can obtain from work-for-relief, and the income from several major sideline productions can exceed this amount. However, the cadres participating in the meeting also realized that due to the large area affected by the floods, the slow receding of the water, and the severity of the disaster, the task of leading the disaster victims in production and surviving the famine was arduous, and there would certainly be many difficulties. Therefore, they believed that the key to doing a good job in production and disaster relief was to make full use of favorable conditions, truly do a good job, and mobilize and organize the masses to take action and engage in various production activities.

The meeting pointed out that, in addition to continuing to strengthen flood control and doing a good job in rescuing and resettling disaster victims in areas where floods have not receded, other areas must quickly make preparations to complete wheat planting in a timely manner. At the same time, it is necessary to do a good job in autumn harvesting and autumn plowing, continue to organize disaster victims to salvage remaining autumn crops, collect tree leaves, wild vegetables, and other substitute foods, and immediately organize disaster victims to develop sideline production and carry out production for self-salvation.

At the meeting, from the exchange of production and disaster relief experiences, everyone unanimously agreed that:

(1) The development of sideline production should not only focus on large items, but also pay attention to small items. Focusing only on large items will inevitably lead to the phenomenon of only asking the higher authorities for raw materials and sales channels. Ignoring small items will lead to a failure to see the huge potential and huge role of developing diverse sideline occupations among the broad masses. Therefore, not only should we engage in large-scale activities, but also in small-scale ones. In order to quickly launch a sideline production campaign, everyone believes that it is very important to make production plans level by level, commune by commune, and household by household, while planning and producing simultaneously. Through the formulation of plans, mobilize the masses and establish confidence in surviving the disaster through production.

(2) To carry out the production and disaster relief movement, it is necessary to rely on the unified leadership of the cooperative, make careful plans, and make comprehensive arrangements. This way, agriculture and sideline occupations, going out to work and producing at home, unified operation by the cooperative and decentralized operation by members, and production for self-salvation and state relief can be properly arranged and correctly combined. According to existing experience in various regions, in order to stimulate the enthusiasm of the broad masses of members in carrying out production and disaster relief, it is necessary to overcome all phenomena of centralization and all-encompassing management without actual implementation. It is also necessary to overcome the phenomenon of abandoning unified leadership and comprehensive arrangements, allowing members to manage their own affairs. Only sideline occupations suitable for operation by the cooperative or team should be operated by the cooperative or team, while those suitable for individual operation by members should be supported and guided. At the same time, for all sideline occupations that are managed in a unified way, labor quotas should be set, and a system of piecework accounting and overproduction rewards should be implemented. In order to give full play to the superiority of cooperatives in production and disaster relief, it is necessary to conduct a consolidation of the cooperatives in conjunction with agricultural and sideline production.

(3) According to the experience of various regions, it is necessary to combine economic work with political and ideological work. It is necessary to support and help cooperatives do a good job in production and supply and marketing, and also to educate members to unite and help each other, practice thrift, improve product quality, enhance confidence in surviving the famine, and prepare for increased agricultural production next year.

(4) Everyone unanimously believes that production and disaster relief is a serious battle, and it is necessary to rely on and give full play to the role of Party and Youth League organizations in this battle. All cadres and Party and Youth League members are required to share weal and woe with the disaster victims, delve into the work, and consult with the masses more.

The meeting also pointed out that it is of utmost importance to continue to oppose the style of subjectivism and bureaucracy in production and disaster relief work.

In addition, the meeting exchanged experiences on specific methods for material supply, animal protection, helping disaster victims solve housing problems, and restoring rural medical networks to prevent and control epidemics.

    有信心有办法战胜灾荒
    河北省具体安排生产救灾工作
    新华社保定31日电　中共河北省委员会和河北省人民委员会联合召开的全省生产救灾、秋收分配会议，对全省生产救灾规划进行了四天讨论后，在30日闭幕。参加会议的全体干部，通过算账和交流生产救灾经验，不仅进一步奠定了战胜灾荒的信心，而且有了组织生产自救的具体办法。
    参加会议的各县领导干部和经济部门的负责干部，在会议开始时，对胜利地度过灾荒并不是人人心里都有“底”的。但是，当大家根据中央拨给的救济款、贷款、副业用原料和以工代赈的投资与灾民度荒需要对照算账之后，就发现胜利度荒的条件是充分存在的。如保定专区粗略算来，今冬四个月，灾区人、畜需要的粮食折款和修房补助用款共约三千多万元，而国家拨给的救济款、贷款、灾民从以工代赈中可得的收益，以及几项主要副业生产的收入，则可超过上数。但是，参加会议的干部也认识到，由于水灾面积较大，积水退的较慢，灾情相当严重，领导灾民生产度荒的任务是艰巨的，困难一定很多，因此，认为作好生产救灾工作的关键，是充分利用有利条件，真正作好工作，发动和组织群众行动起来，投入各种生产活动。
    会议指出：当前除了洪水未落的地区继续加强防汛斗争和作好抢救安置灾民的工作外，其他地区必须迅速作好准备，适时完成种麦。同时，要作好秋收、秋耕，继续组织灾民打捞残秋，采集树叶、野菜等代食品，并要立即组织灾民，开展副业生产，进行生产自救。
    会议上，从交流生产救灾经验中，大家一致认为：
    （一）开展副业生产不能只抓大宗，忽视小项。只抓大的，势必产生只向上边要原料和销路的现象，忽视小的，就会产生看不见广大群众中开展多种多样副业的巨大潜力和巨大作用。因此，不仅搞大的，也要搞小的。为了迅速的开展起副业生产运动，大家认为逐级、逐社、逐户作生产计划，同时边计划、边生产，通过订计划，发动群众，树立生产度荒的信心是很重要的。
      （二）开展生产度荒运动，必须依靠合作社统一领导，周密计划，全面安排。这样作就可以把农业和副业，外出工作和在家生产，社里统一经营与社员分散经营，生产自救与国家救济作到恰当的安排和正确的结合。根据各地已有的经验，为了激发广大社员开展生产救灾的积极性，必须克服一切集中、包而不办的现象，也必须克服放弃统一领导、全面安排，任凭社员各管各的现象。应该只把适合社、队经营的副业由社、队经营，适于社员个人经营的则支持和领导社员个人经营；同时，凡统一经营的副业，应规定劳动定额，实行按件记工、超产奖励制度。为了发挥合作社在生产救灾中的优越性，必须结合农副业生产，进行一次整社。
      （三）根据各地经验，必须把经济工作和政治思想工作结合起来，支持和帮助合作社搞好生产、供销，还必须教育社员团结互助，厉行节约，提高产品质量，增强度荒信心，为明年农业增产作好准备。
      （四）大家一致认为，生产度荒是一场严重的战斗，必须在这场战斗里依靠和充分发挥党、团组织的作用，要求全体干部和党员、团员与灾民同甘共苦，深入工作，多和群众商量。
    会议还指出，在生产救灾工作中继续反对主观主义和官僚主义的作风有极重要的意义。
    此外，会议对物资供应、保畜、帮助灾民解决住房问题、恢复农村医疗网防治疫病等方面的具体作法，都交流了经验。
