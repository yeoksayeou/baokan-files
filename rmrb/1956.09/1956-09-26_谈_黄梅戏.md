Talking About "Huangmei Opera"
	Hong Fei

	(I)
	Huangmei Opera is a local opera of Anhui Province; tracing its origins, it comes from the "Tea-Picking Tune" of Huangmei County, Hubei. According to legend, during the reign of Emperor Qianlong in the Qing Dynasty, Huangmei area suffered continuous floods, and the local people left their homes, some fleeing to Jiujiang and Poyang in Jiangxi, and some fleeing to Susong and Wangjiang in Anhui... The refugees mostly played "Daoqing Drums," hit "Lianxiang" and "Money Plates" to sing "Tea-Picking Tunes," begging from door to door. The "Tea-Picking Tune" of Huangmei County spread in this way.
	The "Tea-Picking Tune" became widely popular between Hubei, Jiangxi, and Anhui, gradually combining with folk art forms such as "Flower Lanterns" and "Stilts" to form a kind of "small opera," which people called "Tea-Picking Opera." Anhui people called it "Huangmei Tune," and it was renamed Huangmei Opera after liberation.
	Huangmei Opera initially performed mostly "two-person plays" (clown and young female role) and "three-person plays" (adding a young male role), such as "Beating Pig Grass," "Husband and Wife Watching Lanterns," and "Spring Outing"; later, influenced by "Gaoqiang," it absorbed many tunes from "Gaoqiang" and imitated the makeup of "Gaoqiang," gradually increasing the number of large-scale plays, the so-called "Zhengben Opera." Therefore, Huangmei Opera was once called "Er Gaoqiang."
	Huangmei Opera initially became popular in the areas of Anhui adjacent to Huangmei in Hubei and Jiujiang in Jiangxi, such as Susong and Wangjiang counties, and only developed eastward after the Daoguang period (Susong, Wangjiang, and other places suffered floods in the 29th year of Daoguang, and the local people also took Huangmei Opera to flee famine), widely popular in the north and south of the Yangtze River centered on Huaining. Huaining was the first county of the old Anqing Prefecture, and the "Hui Tune," one of the components of Peking Opera, was spread from here.
	"Hui Tune" was the local grand opera of Anqing at that time, with a legitimate performance status. Huangmei Opera was a folk small opera called "Flower Drum Lewd Opera," and could not operate publicly. In order to protect themselves, the veteran artists of Huangmei Opera mixed with Hui Opera performers, for example: to celebrate a wedding, they would first sing a "Hui Tune" "Da Jin Zhi," and then sing Huangmei Opera. Because of being in the same troupe with "Hui Tune" for a long time, Huangmei Opera was greatly influenced by "Hui Tune" in singing and performance. The "Daoban" and "Kuban" of Sheng and Dan roles came from "Hui Tune." After Huangmei Opera flowed into the Anqing area centered on Huaining, in addition to being influenced by "Hui Tune," it also absorbed many local folk songs and ditties. This enriched its singing; after entering the city (starting in 1926), it added the Huqin in the accompaniment, which regularized the tune. Over a hundred years of evolution has given Huangmei Opera its own unique style.

	(II)
	Huangmei Opera, through the creation of generations of artists, has accumulated a wealth of repertoires and tunes, providing a deep foundation for reform after liberation.
	According to the old artists, the repertoire of Huangmei Opera is: thirty-six large operas and seventy-three small operas. In fact, by the time of Anqing's liberation, preliminary statistics showed: seventy-seven large operas and eighty-one small operas (including repertoires adapted from storytelling and scripts of brother operas after entering the city). Large operas all have a complete story, such as "The Fairy Couple" and "Accusing the Grain Official" (originally named "Zhang Chaozong Accusing the Steward"); small operas mostly depict fragments of the lives of peasants and handicraftsmen, such as "Beating Pig Grass," "Picking Firewood," "Hollowing Wooden Ladles," and "Mending Bowls," with content full of life and lively forms, with singing and dancing.
	There are more than one hundred tunes in Huangmei Opera, the main ones are: "Ping Ci" (also known as "Zhengban Zhengchang"), used to express calm emotions; "Er Xing" (also known as "Shu Ban"), used to recall the past and tell grievances; "San Xing" (also known as "Kuai Shu Ban"), used to express anxious and nervous emotions; "Huo Gong," used to express angry and surprised emotions; "Cai Qiang," used to express joyful and pleasant emotions; "Yin Si Qiang," a desolate tune sung when ghosts appear; "Xian Qiang," a singing close to "Daoqing" when gods appear. In addition, there are tunes absorbed from "Gaoqiang" and "Hui Tune" and various "Hua Qiang." The so-called "Hua Qiang" is actually folk songs and ditties, such as "Embroidered Pouch" and "Five Watches of Weaving Silk." There is no significant difference between the singing methods of Sheng, Dan, Jing, and Chou in Huangmei Opera; in "Hua Qiang Opera" (small repertoires mostly use Hua Qiang singing), the male and female tunes are exactly the same. The tunes of Huangmei Opera are sung in the Anqing dialect. Anqing is located on the Yangtze River, with convenient transportation and easy-to-understand language. In addition, the singing is always done in the natural voice, so people feel that the pronunciation is clear and it is easier to learn.
	Huangmei Opera is a genre with rich expressive ability. It has absorbed the excellent components of "Gaoqiang" and "Hui Tune," so it can well express the lives of the ancient people; and because it has been circulating in the folk for a long time, constantly absorbing the nourishment of folk art, it is also in a position to express the modern people's lives. Therefore, its development after liberation has been rapid. Before 1952, Huangmei Opera was mainly popular in the Anqing area. After the performance in Shanghai (around October 1952), it attracted attention from all parties. In 1953, the state-run Anhui Huangmei Opera Troupe was established. Today, this troupe has Ding Yongquan, a veteran artist who has been singing Huangmei Opera for forty or fifty years, as well as excellent actors Yan Fengying, Wang Shaofang, and young actors Wang Yuqin, who joined Huangmei Opera after liberation and have achieved remarkable results. In addition, Anqing City and Anqing Prefecture have a total of fifteen professional Huangmei Opera troupes, and there are also many excellent actors, such as Pan Jingli and Ma Cailou, who have won first-class performance awards in the first East China Opera Festival and the first Anhui Province Opera Festival respectively. In addition, there are more than a thousand industrial and agricultural amateur troupes in Anhui Province that perform in the form of Huangmei Opera.

    谈“黄梅戏”
    洪非
    （一）
    黄梅戏是安徽的地方戏；探其根源，它来自湖北黄梅县的“采茶调”。相传清代乾隆年间，黄梅地区不断发生水灾，当地人民纷纷离乡别井，有的逃到江西的九江、鄱阳，有的逃到安徽的宿松、望江……。逃荒的人们大都敲着“道情筒”，打着“连厢”和“金钱板”演唱“采茶调”，沿门乞讨。黄梅县的“采茶调”就这样传播出去了。
    “采茶调”在鄂、赣、皖之间广泛流行，逐渐和“花灯”、“高跷”等民间艺术形式相结合而形成了一种“小戏”，人们称它为“采茶戏”，安徽人又称它为“黄梅调”，解放后改称黄梅戏。
    黄梅戏开始演唱的，多为“两小戏”（小丑、小旦）和“三小戏”（加上小生），如“打猪草”、“夫妻观灯”、“游春”等；后受“高腔”影响，吸收了“高腔”的许多曲调，模仿“高腔”的化装，逐渐增加了大型剧目，即所谓“正本戏”。因此，黄梅戏又曾经被称为“二高腔”。
    黄梅戏最初在安徽流行的地区是与湖北黄梅、江西九江毗邻的宿松、望江等县，清道光以后才向东发展（道光二十九年宿松、望江等地遭受水灾，当地人民也带着黄梅戏出外逃荒），广泛流行在以怀宁为中心的大江南北。怀宁是旧安庆府的首县，作为京剧组成部分之一的“徽调”就是从这里传出去的。
    “徽调”是当时安庆的地方大戏，有着合法的演唱地位。黄梅戏是被称为“花鼓淫戏”的民间小戏，无法公开活动，黄梅戏的前辈艺人为了掩护自己，于是与徽班艺人混合演出，例如：庆贺新婚，开头唱一出“徽调”的“打金枝”，接着再唱黄梅戏。因为与“徽调”长期同班，黄梅戏在唱腔、表演上受“徽调”影响也很大，生、旦的“倒板”、“哭板”都是从“徽调”中来的。黄梅戏流入以怀宁为中心的安庆地区后，除受“徽调”的影响外，还吸收了当地的许多民歌、小调。这样，就使它的唱腔更加丰富了；进入城市后（1926年起），在伴奏上添了胡琴，又使曲调规律化了。百余年来的衍变，使黄梅戏形成了它自己的独特风格。
    （二）
    黄梅戏，经过历代艺人的创造，积累了丰富的剧目和曲调，为解放后的改革，提供了深厚的基础。
    黄梅戏的剧目，按老艺人的说法是：大戏三十六本，小戏七十三出。实际上到安庆解放时为止，初步统计有：大戏七十七本，小戏八十一出（包括进入城市后根据弹词和兄弟剧种的脚本改编的剧目）。大戏都有一个完整的故事，如“天仙配”、“告粮官”（原名“张朝宗告经承”）等；小戏所表现的大都是农民和手工业者的生活断片，如“打猪草”、“捡柴”、“剜木瓢”、“补碗”等，内容富于生活气息，形式活泼，有歌有舞。
    黄梅戏的曲调共有一百多种，主要的是：“评词”（又称“正板正唱”），用于表达平静的情绪；“二行”（又称“数板”），用于回忆往事，诉说苦情；“三行”（又称“快数板”），用于表达急躁、紧张的情绪；“火攻”，用于表达愤怒、惊异的情绪；“彩腔”，用于表达欢乐、愉快的情绪；“阴司腔”，鬼魂出场时唱的一种凄凉的调子；“仙腔”，神仙出场时唱的一种近乎“道情”的唱腔。此外还有从“高腔”和“徽调”中吸收来的曲调和各种“花腔”。所谓“花腔”，实即民间歌谣小调，如“绣荷包”、“五更织绢”等。黄梅戏里的生、旦、净、丑的唱法没有什么显著的分别；在“花腔戏”（小型剧目多用花腔演唱）中，男、女的腔调则完全一致。黄梅戏的曲调是以安庆的语音来歌唱的。安庆地临长江，交通便利，语言易懂，加之唱时一律用本嗓子，所以使人感到字音清晰，学起来也较容易。
    黄梅戏是一个富有表现能力的剧种，它吸收了“高腔”和“徽调”中的优良成份，所以能够很好地表现古代人民的生活；又因为它长期流传于民间，不断吸收着民间艺术的养料，也就有条件表现现代人民生活。因此它在解放后的发展是突飞猛进的。1952年以前，黄梅戏主要在安庆地区流行，到上海观摩演出后（1952年10月间），引起了各方面的重视。1953年就成立了国营安徽省黄梅戏剧团。如今这个剧团有演唱黄梅戏四、五十年之久的老艺人丁永泉以及优秀的演员严凤英、王少舫，还有解放后才参加黄梅戏工作，而取得了卓越成绩的青年演员王毓琴等。另外，安庆市和安庆专区共有十五个职业的黄梅剧团，也有不少的优秀演员，像潘璟琍、麻彩楼都分别在华东第一届戏曲会演和安徽省第一届戏曲会演中得到了一等表演奖。此外，安徽省还有一千多个以黄梅戏形式演唱的工、农业余剧团。
