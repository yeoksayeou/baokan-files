    (15) Valley of the Kings

    Crossing the Nile from Luxor and driving for about ten kilometers, we arrived at a mountainous area with towering peaks and strangely shaped rocks. This is where the tombs of the ancient Egyptian kings are located, known as the "Valley of the Kings." It contains the tombs of the ancient Egyptian kings of the 18th, 19th, and 20th dynasties, dating from around the 16th to the 10th centuries BC. Sixty-two huge tombs have been discovered in the Valley of the Kings. In 1922, the most complete tomb was discovered: the tomb of Tutankhamun from around the 14th century BC. All the other tombs had been looted and were incomplete, except for this one, which was intact because it was located near the tomb of another king, Ramses VI, which was built on higher ground. The pile of stones deeply concealed Tutankhamun's tomb, so it was not damaged by anyone. More than 1,700 relics were discovered in this tomb, providing important information for scholars studying Egypt. We entered the cave of Ramses VI's tomb, and walked about one hundred meters along a wide stone corridor to reach its depths. There, a huge stone coffin was placed, which had been split into two pieces. The walls of the stone corridor are engraved with various patterns and hieroglyphs, which are available for historians and archaeologists to study.

    Leaving the Valley of the Kings and driving further, we arrived at a magnificent queen's tomb, built by the famous queen Hatshepsut for herself. The queen's tomb is backed by majestic hills. Stepping through the gate, the queen's tomb appears extremely deep, displaying the authority of this queen. It is said that because she was a queen, she suffered revenge from some jealous people after her death. They destroyed a huge stone statue of the queen, and we can still see many fragments of this destroyed statue in the front yard of the queen's tomb. The queen's portrait painted on a giant wall was also scraped off by later generations, but upon closer inspection, the original appearance of the portrait can still be discerned. The queen is wearing a false beard, wearing the crowns of Upper and Lower Egypt, and a lion is painted under her feet to show her power. On another wall are painted many measuring instruments and trees. There is also a vivid picture depicting the queen's large ship, fully loaded with goods, returning victoriously from opening up trade in Somaliland, East Africa.

    In this area, you can also see the "Valley of the Queens" and some tombs of ancient Egyptian nobles. The tombstone of a talented ancient Egyptian court architect is engraved with such bold words: "In the years to come, I will be praised for my knowledge by those who will inherit the cause I have accomplished." Yes, the outstanding architectural art of ancient Egypt has won the eternal praise of all mankind. Luxor, this city of stone, has become a valuable legacy of human architectural art.

    埃及纪游

    十五）帝王之谷
    从拉克索渡过尼罗河，驱车前行约十公里，到了一个山峰突起，奇石丛生的山谷地带。这里是古埃及帝王的陵墓所在地，被称为“帝王之谷”。那里有着从纪元前十六世纪到十世纪左右古埃及第十八、十九、二十朝代的历代帝王的陵墓。在帝王谷现已发现了六十二个巨大的陵墓。在1922年，最完整的一个陵墓被发现了。这是纪元前十四世纪左右的吐丹哈蒙的陵墓。所有其余的陵墓都已被盗劫一空，残缺不全。只有这一座是完整的，因为在它的近旁是另一个帝王拉美西六世的陵墓，这个陵墓建于高地上，石堆深深地掩藏了吐丹哈蒙的陵墓，所以它没有遭到任何人的破坏。在这个陵墓内发现了一千七百多件遗物，为研究埃及的学者提供了重要的资料。我们走进了拉美西六世陵墓的洞穴，沿着一条宽阔的石头的长廊，步行一百公尺左右才到达它的深处。那里放着一个巨大的石棺，已裂成了两块。石廊的墙上刻着各种花纹和象形文字，可供历史家和考古家的研究。
    离开帝王之谷，再驱车前行，到达一个宏大的女王陵，这是埃及历史上著名的女王赫切普舍特为自己建立的。女王陵背靠着雄伟的山岗。跨进大门，一眼望去，女王陵极其深远，显示了这位女王的权威。据说，因为她是女王，所以死后遭到一些嫉妒者的报复。他们把女王的一个巨大的石像捣毁了，现在我们仍能在女王陵的前院内看到这个被毁的石像的许多碎块。在一垛巨壁上画着的女王像也被后代的人刮掉了。但仔细看去，还能辨认出画像的原来模样。女王装着假须，戴着上下埃及的王冠，脚下画着一只狮子，以显示她的权力。在另一垛墙上画着许多度量衡器具及树木之类。还有一幅生动的图画描绘女王的大船满载货物，从东非索马里兰开拓贸易，胜利归来。
    在这一带，还能看到“皇后之谷”和一些古代埃及贵族的陵墓。一个古代埃及的天才的宫廷建筑师的墓碑上刻着这样的豪语：“在未来的岁月里，我将因我的知识而受到那些将要继承我所完成的事业的人们的赞扬。”是的，古埃及的卓越的建筑艺术已经博得全人类的永恒的赞扬了。拉克索，这座石头的城已成为人类建筑艺术的一笔珍贵的遗产。（附图片）
