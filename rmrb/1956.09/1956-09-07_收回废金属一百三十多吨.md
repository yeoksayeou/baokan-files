　　Recovered Over 130 Tons of Scrap Metal

　　(Our dispatch) The Chinese Communist Party Committee of the Shenyang Transformer Factory issued a call to all factory workers in early August, mobilizing them to thoroughly recover the scrap metal abandoned or buried around the factory area, and designated August as Scrap Metal Recovery Month.

　　The Party Committee's call received the support of all factory workers. From the beginning of August, groups of workers picked up or dug up scrap metal scattered everywhere in their spare time every day. By August 24, the factory had recovered 127 tons of scrap steel and 10 tons and 900 kilograms of scrap copper, worth a total of 39,900 yuan, which can produce sixteen 100 kVA power transformers, enough to supply lighting for a city of 40,000 people.

　　The Shenyang Transformer Factory is undergoing a comprehensive renovation this year, and many workshops are operating in parallel with production and renovation, with tight and heavy tasks, coupled with poor management, resulting in scrap copper and iron everywhere. In addition, due to insufficient supply of raw materials, shutdowns and waiting for materials often occur. Some workers have been automatically recovering scrap metal after witnessing this phenomenon. Now, the factory Party Committee's call has mobilized all the workers. The workers of the Power Section alone recovered six tons of scrap copper and four tons of scrap steel in more than a week of spare time. These recovered scrap metal include wires, pipes, electrical switches, etc., which can be directly used in production. In the scrap metal recovery campaign, the workers of the Insulation Workshop also processed the waste edges of old insulation paperboard that had been accumulated in the workshop for many years. The workers of the entire workshop have selected more than four tons of waste edges of insulation paperboard in their spare time, and temporarily installed a small shear and punch press to process these edges into useful parts. Preliminary statistics show that this can save the country more than 14,000 yuan. The youth supervision post of the Cold Working Workshop led all the young workers of the workshop to recover more than 13,000 old parts. After simple processing and repair, more than 30% have been used in production.

### 收回废金属一百三十多吨

    收回废金属一百三十多吨
    本报讯　中共沈阳变压器厂党委在8月上旬向全厂职工发出号召，动员全厂职工把遗弃或埋藏在厂区周围的废金属彻底收回，并确定8月份为废金属回收月。
    党委的号召得到了全厂职工的支持。从8月上旬起，每天都有成群结队的职工在业余时间拾拣或挖掘散在各处的废金属。到8月24日止，全厂已收回废钢铁一百二十七吨、废铜十吨零九百公斤，折合人民币三万九千九百多元，可以生产一百千伏安电力变压器十六台，能供四万人口的城市照明使用。
    沈阳变压器厂今年正在进行全面改建，许多车间都在边生产边改建中平行交叉作业，各项任务紧张繁重，加上管理不善，碎铜烂铁到处都是。另外，由于原材料供应不足，却又时常发生停工待料现象。有的职工目睹这种现象已在自动回收废金属，现在，厂党委会的号召更把全体职工都动员了起来。仅动力科的职工们在一周多的业余时间内，就回收了废铜六吨，废钢铁四吨。这些被收回的废金属中有电线、管材、电气开关等，可以直接用到生产上去。绝缘车间的职工们在回收废金属运动中，还同时处理了车间里长年积压下来的旧绝缘纸板的边料。全车间职工利用生产空余时间已挑选出绝缘纸板边料四吨多，并临时安装上了一台小型剪床和冲床，把这些边料加工成为有用的部件，初步统计可为国家节约一万四千多元。冷作车间青年监督岗带动车间全体青年工人回收了一万三千多个旧零件，经过简单地加工修理，已有30％多用到了生产上去。
