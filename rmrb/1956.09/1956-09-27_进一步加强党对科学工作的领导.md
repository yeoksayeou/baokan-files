Further Strengthen the Party's Leadership over Scientific Work

Speech by Comrade Yu Guangyuan, Director of the Science Department of the Propaganda Department of the CPC Central Committee

I completely agree with the reports of Comrades Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, and Deng Xiaoping. Now, I would like to express a few personal opinions on the issue of our Party's leadership over scientific work.

My first point is that I hope all sectors will further value scientific work. Since the Central Committee convened the conference on intellectual issues, scientific work has been placed in a very important position, and all sectors have gradually begun to attach importance to it. The enthusiasm of our country's scientists to use their scientific research to help socialist construction has therefore greatly increased. Under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, and through half a year of efforts, our scientists and all relevant parties have cooperated to initially draft the Twelve-Year Long-Range Plan for Natural Sciences (including technical sciences) and Philosophy and Social Sciences. The plan stipulates the scientific tasks that must be completed within twelve years and the scientific departments that must be focused on, and also stipulates the important measures that must be taken to develop China's scientific undertaking. Many provinces and cities have also strengthened their leadership over scientific work. The recent proposal of the "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" policy has played a great role in encouraging scientists to fully utilize their creativity in research work. Generally speaking, extremely favorable conditions are already in place for the prosperity and development of China's scientific undertaking. However, scientific research, especially basic theoretical research, often cannot produce quick results. Therefore, it is still very difficult for scientific work to be placed on the agenda of the central departments or local party committees. We must recognize that if we do not make every effort to rapidly develop the scientific undertaking today, practical work will suffer great losses in the future. For example, our economists have not yet conducted sufficient research on the rich experience of socialist transformation and socialist construction, and many theoretical issues in the socialist economy have not yet been systematically resolved. If we do not actively change this situation, both economic work and theoretical education work will be adversely affected in the future. Another example is that in the past few years, geological departments did not pay enough attention to scientific research, and there were very few new scientific research results. The exploration clues provided by scientific research results from several decades before liberation have almost been exhausted, which has brought many difficulties to the current exploration work. Now the geological department has noticed the need to strengthen scientific research work, otherwise it will cause even greater difficulties in the future. Whether or not to value scientific work is a matter of foresight. We communists should be very farsighted.

My second point is that we must strive to learn and make ourselves experts in leading scientific work. Comrade Shaoqi's report pointed out: "The Party should and can play a leading role in all work, ideologically, politically, and in terms of policies and principles." All work mentioned here of course includes scientific work. Obviously, without the Party's proposal of guidelines and policies for developing the scientific undertaking, doing a good job in uniting, educating, and organizing scientists, strengthening the Marxist-Leninist ideological guidance of scientific research, mobilizing all aspects of forces to support the scientific undertaking, and promoting greater coordination of scientific research work in all aspects, the rapid development of China's scientific undertaking would be impossible. In order to enable the Party to better lead scientific work, and in order to deepen the Party's leadership into all scientific departments, our comrades must strive to study scientific work, learn scientific knowledge, and master the laws of scientific work. Although our comrades are not very familiar with scientific work today, everything is learnable for us. We should not have a fear of difficulties, and we should not "go around science." To lead scientific work, the Party must rely heavily on scientists. Modern science is highly specialized, and it is not easy for non-experts in one field to understand the details of that field. We must humbly consult experts in all fields on scientific issues, we should not pretend to know what we do not know, and we should not interfere too much. For example, in the formulation of the Twelve-Year Long-Range Plan for the development of the scientific undertaking, our Party put forward guidelines, did organizational work and ideological work, and the specific content of various scientific tasks and various scientific plans were researched together with the scientists. Our comrades have learned a lot of useful knowledge in contact with scientists. In the process of formulating the plan, we also received great help from Soviet scientists. Without their knowledge and experience, many problems could not be solved well. For example, in order to develop genetics in our country, the Party cannot but pay attention to the long-standing debate between the Michurin school and the Morgan school. This debate can only be resolved by biologists themselves. At the suggestion of our Party, the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Ministry of Higher Education recently convened dozens of biologists in Qingdao to hold a symposium on genetics. After more than ten days of heated discussion at the meeting, neither the Michurin school nor the Morgan school could convince the other based on sufficient scientific facts. This shows that genetics is still a young scientific field, and many important controversial issues have not yet matured to the point of drawing conclusions. On such issues, based on the principle of "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend," we support their scientific research work, and hope that they will consider the issues humbly, learn everything that can be learned from the other party in a pragmatic way, and let scientific research achievements make the final conclusion. The Party's experience in leading scientific work is still limited, and we should accumulate and summarize this experience in our work, and we must not "be content with being a layman."

My third point is to earnestly improve the working conditions of scientific researchers. Improving the working conditions of scientific researchers is a prerequisite for the development of the scientific undertaking. Scientists have pointed out that in order to enable our country's scientific research work to approach and catch up with the world's advanced level, library work, data work, scientific information work, metrology and standardization work, etc., must first approach and catch up with the world's advanced level. The Central Committee's conference on intellectuals convened in January of this year also emphasized this issue. But until now, the work in this area has not been done very well. Some work has not been taken care of seriously, and some work, although taken care of, has not received strong support from all relevant parties, so that many problems have not been resolved in a timely manner. For example, in order to facilitate our scientists to accept the world's cultural heritage and grasp the world's scientific intelligence in a timely manner, it is necessary to organize translation forces, train foreign language cadres, and translate important foreign scientific works. This work needs to be carried out more actively and in a planned way. For example, the production, procurement, supply, repair, etc. of scientific instruments and equipment have always been a big problem and there have always been many difficulties. To solve this problem, it is necessary to rely not only on scientific institutions, but also on the joint efforts of industry, commerce, material allocation, foreign trade, and finance and planning departments. However, some comrades often believe that the issue of scientific instruments and equipment is complex, trivial, and troublesome, and is not their main work, and they have not spent much effort to solve it. In the past six months, although there have been some improvements in this area of ​​work, and some meetings have been held and some issues have been studied, no decisions have been made and effective measures have been taken. After the overall public-private partnership and the cooperation of handicrafts, the original connections between scientific institutions and manufacturers have either been interrupted or have added some unnecessary restrictions, which have instead created new difficulties for scientific research. The departments of the Party committee that manage science should regularly urge the relevant departments to seize the time to solve the problem of scientific working conditions.

My fourth point is to allocate and train cadres for scientific organizational work. Now the Party and the state are vigorously strengthening the Academy of Sciences, enriching existing and establishing new scientific institutions, and strengthening scientific research work in universities and industrial sectors. Many departments of the Party and the state also have close ties with the scientific undertaking. This requires many cadres for scientific organizational work. However, there are relatively few experts in our country. In order to correctly use our country's scientific strength, we should not transfer many experts to administrative posts. Therefore, we can only transfer Party member cadres from all aspects to scientific work posts. In March of this year, the Central Committee designated to transfer eighteen responsible cadres to the Academy of Sciences, and set a deadline for reporting in mid-April, but only five people have reported to date. At a time when we are actively creating the foundation of the scientific undertaking, it is entirely necessary to transfer a group of key members to scientific work posts like for industry. This work should receive strong support from all aspects. We should also pay attention to and carry out the training of cadres for scientific organizational work in a planned way. Administrative heads and Party organizations of the Academy of Sciences, universities, and industrial sectors should regularly pay attention to explaining the Party's guidelines and policies on scientific work to cadres engaged in scientific organizational work, and organize these cadres to study scientific knowledge. The departments of Party committees at all levels that manage scientific work should also strengthen this aspect of work.

### 进一步加强党对科学工作的领导

    进一步加强党对科学工作的领导
    中共中央宣传部科学处处长　于光远同志的发言
    我完全同意刘少奇、周恩来、邓小平同志的报告。现在就我们党对科学工作的领导问题发表几点个人的意见。
    第一点意见是希望各方面进一步重视科学工作。在中央召开关于知识分子问题会议之后，科学工作已经摆到非常重要的位置，各方面对科学工作也逐渐重视起来，我国科学家用自己的科学研究工作来帮助社会主义建设的热情因而也大为提高。在党中央和国务院的领导下，经过半年的努力，我国科学家和各有关方面合作，初步拟定了自然科学（包括技术科学）和哲学社会科学十二年远景规划，规定了十二年内必须完成的科学任务和必须着重发展的科学部门，规定了为了发展我国科学事业必须采取的重要措施。许多省市也加强了对科学工作的领导。最近“百家争鸣”方针的提出，对于鼓励科学家在研究工作中充分地发挥创造性，起了很大的作用。总的说来，繁荣和发展我国的科学事业，已经具备极其良好的条件。但是科学研究，特别是基本理论的研究，往往是不能够见到速效的，因此，科学工作还很不容易排上中央各部门或是地方党委的议事日程。我们要认识到，如果今天不尽一切努力迅速发展科学事业，将来实际工作就会受到很大损失。比如我国的经济学家对社会主义改造和社会主义建设的丰富经验还没有很好地研究，社会主义经济中的许多理论问题，也还没有得到系统的解决，如果我们不去积极地改变这种状况，将来不论经济工作或是理论教育工作，都会受到不利的影响。又比如前几年地质部门对科学研究重视不够，新的科学研究成果很少，而解放前几十年科学研究成果所提供的勘探线索又已经差不多用完了，给目前勘探工作带来了许多困难。现在地质部门已经注意到加强科学研究工作，否则将来会造成更大的困难。重视不重视科学工作是有没有远见的问题，我们共产党人是应该很有远见的。
    第二点意见是我们要努力学习，使自己成为领导科学工作的内行。少奇同志的报告指出：“党应当而且可以在思想上、政治上、方针政策上对于一切工作起领导作用”。这里说的一切工作当然包括科学工作在内。很显然，如果没有党提出发展科学事业的方针和政策，做好团结教育科学家和组织科学家的工作，加强对科学研究的马克思列宁主义的思想指导，动员各方面力量去支援科学事业，和促使各方面的科学研究工作更加协调，我国科学事业的迅速发展是不可能的。为了使党对科学工作领导得更好，为了使党的领导深入到各个科学部门当中去，我们的同志就要努力钻研科学业务，学习科学知识，掌握科学工作的规律。我们的同志今天尽管对科学工作还不大熟悉，但是，对我们来说，什么事情都是学得会的，不应该有畏难心理，不应该“绕开科学走”。党领导科学工作，要很好地依靠科学家。现代科学分工很细，不是这一行的专家就不容易弄清楚这一行的底细，我们在科学问题上一定要向各行的专家们虚心地请教，不应该强不知以为知，不应该过多地干涉。比如这次制定发展科学事业的十二年远景规划，我们党提出了方针、做了组织工作和思想工作，而各项科学任务和各门科学规划的具体内容都是和科学家们一起研究出来的。我们的同志在和科学家的接触中学习到很多有用的知识。在制定规划的过程中，我们还得到苏联科学家的很大帮助，没有他们的知识和经验，许多问题就不能很好的解决。又比如为了发展我国的遗传学，党就不能不关心到米丘林学派和摩尔根学派之间长期存在着的争论。这一争论只有靠生物学家自己来解决。在我们党的建议下，中国科学院和高等教育部最近召集了几十位生物学家在青岛开了一个遗传学问题座谈会。在会上经过十几天热烈的讨论，不论米丘林学派或者摩尔根学派都还不能根据充足的科学事实说服对方。这说明了遗传学还是一门年青的科学部门，许多重要的争论问题还没有成熟到作结论的地步。对这样的问题，我们本着百家争鸣的方针，支持他们的科学研究工作，并且希望他们虚心地考虑问题，实事求是地向对方学习一切可以学习的东西，让科学研究成就来做最后结论。党领导科学工作的经验还是不多的，我们应该在工作中积累和总结这种经验，决不可以“安于做外行”。
    第三点意见是要切实改善科学研究人员的工作条件。改善科学研究人员的工作条件是发展科学事业的前提。科学家们提出为了使我国科学研究工作能够接近和赶上世界先进水平，图书馆工作、资料工作、科学情报工作、计量标准工作等等，首先就要接近和赶上世界先进水平。今年一月中央召开的关于知识分子的会议也着重地提出了这个问题。但是直到现在，这一方面的工作做得并不算很好。有些工作还没有人认真管，有些工作虽然有人管，但是得不到各有关方面的有力支持，以致很多问题得不到及时解决。比如：为了便于我国科学家接受世界文化遗产和及时地掌握世界科学情报，就有必要组织翻译力量，培养外文干部，把外国重要科学著作翻译过来。这个工作需要更加积极地有计划地来进行。又比如：科学器材的生产、采购、供应、修理等等，问题一直很大，困难一直很多。为了解决这个问题，不仅要靠科学机关，而且要靠工业、商业、物资调拨、对外贸易以及财政、计划等部门的共同努力。但是，有些同志往往认为科学器材问题复杂、琐碎、麻烦，不是自己主要的工作，没有花力气去解决。半年多来，这方面的工作虽然有些改进，也开了些会，研究了些问题，但是始终没有作出决定，采取切实有效的措施。在全面公私合营和手工业合作化后，科学机关和厂商原有的联系，或者中断了，或者添加了一些不必要的限制，反而使科学研究遇到了新的困难。党委管理科学的部门应该经常督促有关部门抓紧解决科学工作条件问题。
    第四点意见是调配和培养科学组织工作的干部。现在党和国家正在大力加强科学院，充实原有的和建立新的科学机构，并在高等学校和产业部门加强科学研究工作。党和国家的许多部门也都和科学事业有密切的关系。这样就需要有许多科学组织工作的干部。但是我国专家比较少，为了正确的使用我国的科学力量，又不应该把许多专家调到行政工作岗位上去，因此只有从各方面抽调党员干部到科学工作岗位上去。今年三月中央指名为科学院抽调十八名负责干部，并且限期于四月中旬报到，但直到今天为止报到的只有五个人。在我们积极创立科学事业基础的时候，像为工业那样抽调一批骨干到科学工作岗位上去是完全必要的。这个工作应该得到各方面的大力支持。关于培养科学组织工作干部，也要重视和有计划的进行。科学院、高等学校和产业部门的行政负责人和党的组织，要经常注意向做科学组织工作的干部解释党对科学工作的方针和政策，组织这些干部对科学知识的学习。各级党委管理科学工作的部门也应该加强这方面的工作。
