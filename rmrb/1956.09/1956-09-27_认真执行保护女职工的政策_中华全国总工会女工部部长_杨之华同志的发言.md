Earnestly Implement Policies to Protect Female Workers
Speech by Comrade Yang Zhihua, Director of the Women Workers Department of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions
Our country's female workers are an indispensable force in socialist construction - The erroneous view that it is "uneconomical" to use and train female workers must be criticized and overcome - Socialist countries inevitably provide meticulous care for mothers and children - Actively absorb women into social labor - Suggestions to relevant central departments

I fully agree with Chairman Mao's opening speech and the reports made by Comrades Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, and Deng Xiaoping on behalf of the Central Committee.

Now, I would like to express some opinions on the protection of female workers.

Under the leadership and care of the Party and the government, the situation of female workers and staff in our country has undergone fundamental changes in the political, economic, cultural, and living aspects. Currently, the number of female workers is four times that of the early days of liberation. They are active on all fronts of industry, transportation, commerce, and culture and education. The number of female activists elected as group leaders or above in trade unions has reached 320,000; 450,000 female workers are participating in amateur cultural studies; and the state has taken many specific measures to protect the special interests of female workers, with more than 6,000 nurseries and breastfeeding rooms.

The liberated and organized female workers and staff have made obvious contributions to socialist construction. They are an indispensable force in socialist construction. We should cherish this force and pay attention to giving play to their active role.

However, to further stimulate the enthusiasm of female workers, I believe that we must criticize and overcome some erroneous views that it is "uneconomical" to use and train female workers. People who hold this erroneous view think it is troublesome to use female workers, saying: unmarried female workers want to fall in love, and once they fall in love, they cannot concentrate on their work; married female workers want to get pregnant, and once they are pregnant, they have to be transferred to light work. If they are not properly protected and have a miscarriage, the leadership will have to make a self-criticism; after pregnancy, they have to give birth, and after giving birth, they have to be given maternity leave and nurseries have to be set up; female workers with children have to breastfeed, and someone has to replace them during breastfeeding. When the children are sick, they have to be absent from work, and so on. In short, they think it is too troublesome to use female workers, it costs more money and increases the number of employees, which does not seem to conform to the principle of economic accounting.

This erroneous thinking has led to intolerable behavior. Some factories and institutions, whose work by its nature women can clearly handle, find many excuses not to hire women, and some even use deceitful means to achieve the purpose of not hiring women. Some female workers and staff have been laid off, demoted, or even dismissed because they are pregnant or have children. Some enterprises do not take care of pregnant and breastfeeding female workers and staff and do not give them time to breastfeed; some enterprises do not pay attention to labor protection for pregnant women, and the miscarriage rate of pregnant female workers is very high. This serious situation that violates the Party's policies and government decrees has occurred in some places.

Why should socialist countries provide meticulous care for mothers and children? Because children are the successors of the socialist cause and the builders of the future communist society. Not regarding the important social responsibility of child care and education as merely a private matter of mothers is precisely where the socialist system is superior to any exploiting system. It is completely reasonable and necessary to spend some necessary money to protect mothers and children.

In addition to raising children, female workers and staff also participate in social labor alongside male workers. Female workers account for 14 percent of the total number of workers in the country, while female advanced producers account for 12 percent of the total number of advanced producers, which is the best illustration. Their hard work has created a large amount of material wealth for the country. If we admit that mothers should be cared for and protected, then female workers and staff who are mothers and participate in labor should be given even more care and protection. Experience over the years has proven that where the Party's policy of protecting female workers is earnestly implemented and ideological education for female workers is done well, the production situation there is significantly different. For example, Chengdu Public-Private Joint Yuhua Cotton Mill has recently focused on solving the special problems of female workers. Pregnant and breastfeeding female workers who were rated as advanced producers in the socialist competition accounted for 34.8 percent of the total number of advanced producers in the factory.

Actively absorbing women into social labor in order to thoroughly liberate women and ensure the victory of socialist construction is our consistent proposition as communists. Because only in social labor can women be trained, learn skills, and thus make greater contributions to society and improve their status. Because only by absorbing a large number of women to participate in construction and giving play to their huge potential strength can socialist construction succeed. Therefore, the thought of valuing men over women, which is concealed under various pretexts of so-called "economic accounting," is untenable from any aspect.

Our Party has always been concerned about the interests of women—especially the interests of working women. We must constantly criticize and correct the thinking and behavior that discriminate against female workers and staff, and strengthen the supervision of the protection and welfare work for female workers. I suggest that the State Planning Commission, the State Economic Commission, and the State Construction Commission clearly stipulate that all units that employ female workers should fully consider the special needs of protecting female workers in the design of labor quotas, cost accounting, auxiliary production equipment, and ancillary buildings, so as to further stimulate the active role of female workers in socialist construction.

    认真执行保护女职工的政策
    中华全国总工会女工部部长　杨之华同志的发言
    我国女职工是社会主义建设中的一支不可忽视的力量——必须批判和克服所谓使用和培养女职工“不合算”的错误观点——社会主义国家必然无微不至地关怀母亲和儿童——积极吸收妇女参加社会劳动——对中央有关部门的建议
    我完全同意毛主席的开幕词和刘少奇同志、周恩来同志、邓小平同志代表中央委员会所作的各项报告。
    现在，我仅就保护女职工问题发表一点意见。
    在党和政府的领导关怀下，我国女工、女职员在政治、经济、文化、生活各方面的景况都起了根本的变化。现在，女职工的人数为解放初期的四倍，她们活跃在工业、交通运输、商业、文教各个战线上；当选为工会小组长以上的女积极分子达到三十二万；参加业余文化学习的女工达到四十五万；国家为了保护女职工的特殊利益，采取了很多具体措施，仅托儿所、哺乳室就有六千余个。
    已经获得解放和组织起来的女工、女职员对于社会主义建设作出了有目共睹的贡献。她们是社会主义建设中一支不可忽视的力量。我们应当爱惜这支力量，注意发挥她们的积极作用。
    但是，要进一步发挥女职工的积极性，我认为必须批判和克服某些所谓使用和培养女职工“不合算”的错误观点。抱着这种错误观点的人，认为用女职工麻烦，说：未结婚的女职工要谈恋爱，一谈恋爱，工作精神就不集中；结了婚的女职工要怀孕，怀了孕便得调动轻便工作，要是保护不好，流产了领导上还得检讨；怀孕后要生孩子，生了孩子要给产假，要办托儿所；有孩子的女职工要喂奶，喂奶时要有人代替工作，孩子病了要缺勤，等等。总之，他们认为用女职工麻烦透了，要多花钱，增加定员，似乎不合经济核算原则。
    这种错误的思想带来了不可容忍的行为。有些工厂和机关的工作，按它的性质明明是妇女可以胜任的，却找出许多借口不要妇女，有的甚至用瞒骗的手段达到不收妇女的目的。有些女工、女职员因为怀孕、有孩子便被编余、降职，甚至被解雇。有些企业对怀孕和喂奶的女工、女职员不加照顾，不给喂奶时间；有些企业不注意对孕妇的劳动保护工作，怀孕的女工流产率很大。这种违反党的政策和政府法令的严重情况，有些地方发生过。
    为什么社会主义国家要无微不至地关怀母亲和儿童呢？因为儿童是社会主义事业的接班人，是未来共产主义社会的建设者。不把儿童的保育和教养这种重要的社会职责看作仅仅是母亲的私事，这正是社会主义制度优越于任何剥削制度的地方。为了保护母亲和儿童，花一些必须花的钱，是完全合理的，应该的。
    女工、女职员除了抚育孩子以外，还和男职工并肩参加社会劳动。全国女职工占全国职工总数的百分之十四，而女先进生产者占先进生产者总数的百分之十二，就是最好的说明。她们的辛勤的劳动，为国家创造了大量物质财富。如果我们承认做母亲的妇女应该关怀和保护，那么，对于参加劳动的做母亲的女工、女职员，更应该给予关怀和保护。几年来经验证明，那里认真地贯彻党保护女职工的政策和做好对女职工的思想教育工作，那里的生产情况就有显著的不同。例如，成都公私合营裕华纱厂近来着重解决了女工特殊问题，怀孕和哺乳的女工在社会主义竞赛中被评为先进生产者的，就占厂里先进生产者总数的百分之三十四点八。
    积极吸收妇女参加社会劳动，以求彻底解放妇女和保证社会主义建设的胜利，这是我们共产主义者的一贯主张。因为只有在社会劳动中，妇女才能得到锻炼，学会本领，从而对社会作出更大贡献和提高自己的地位。因为只有吸收广大妇女参加建设，发挥她们巨大的潜在力量，社会主义建设才能成功。所以，在所谓“经济核算”种种口实掩盖下的重男轻女的思想，无论从那一方面说来，都是站不住脚的。
    我们党从来都是关心妇女利益——尤其是劳动妇女的利益的，我们必须经常批判和纠正歧视女工、女职员的思想和行为，加强对女职工的保护和福利工作的监督。我建议国家计划委员会、国家经济委员会和国家建设委员会明确规定，凡使用女职工的单位，应该在劳动定员、成本计算、生产的辅助设备和附属建筑的设计上，充分考虑到保护女职工的特殊需要，以便进一步发挥女职工在社会主义建设中的积极作用。
