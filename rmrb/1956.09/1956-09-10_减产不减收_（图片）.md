    "Reduced Production, No Loss of Income"
    After suffering three severe natural disasters – hail, wind, and mountain floods – in mid-July to early August, the Jinxing Agricultural, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative in Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, led by the renowned agricultural labor model Li Shunda, convened a cooperative affairs committee and a meeting of cooperative members to discuss ways to "recover and make up for" the losses. They put forward the slogan "Reduced Production, No Loss of Income," overcoming the pessimistic, disappointed, and passive thoughts existing among the cooperative members. Now, the cooperative members are full of confidence in overcoming the disasters and are fighting against the natural disasters, and are also developing various new sideline productions to compensate for the losses suffered in agriculture. Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhang Ruihua photographed this.
    This is the brick-making sideline of the Jinxing Agricultural, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative. It is estimated that three kilns of bricks will be fired this year, which can generate an income of more than 2,400 yuan.

    “减产不减收”
    著名的农业劳动模范李顺达领导的山西省平顺县金星农林牧生产合作社，在7月中旬到8月初，连续遭受到冰雹、风、山洪三次严重的自然灾害后，召开了社务委员会和社员大会，讨论“找回来、补起来”的办法。他们提出了“减产不减收”的口号，克服了社员们存在的悲观失望消极思想。现在社员们正满怀着战胜灾害的信心，向自然灾害作斗争，并且开展了多种新的副业生产，以弥补在农业方面所遭受的损失。　新华社记者　张瑞华摄
