Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 6th -- Saigon Dispatch: The Ngo Dinh Diem authorities recently promulgated a decree forcing the naturalization of overseas Chinese. It stipulates that all overseas Chinese born in Vietnam, including those born before the signing of this decree, will be considered Vietnamese citizens. It is estimated that this decree will deprive approximately 500,000 overseas Chinese of their Chinese nationality.

Ngo Dinh Diem's newspapers also explained that this forced naturalization decree also applies to overseas Chinese students born in Vietnam who are studying outside of South Vietnam, "regardless of whether they want to or not."

After the promulgation of this decree, the South Vietnamese authorities immediately stopped issuing alien identification cards to overseas Chinese born in Vietnam, and stipulated that newborn infants must be registered with Vietnamese names.

This unilateral measure of forcibly naturalizing overseas Chinese has brought the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities' recent restrictions and persecution of overseas Chinese to a new peak. The Ngo Dinh Diem authorities have issued decrees requiring overseas Chinese merchants to keep accounts in Vietnamese or French, restricting overseas Chinese from applying for import and export licenses, and so on.

Saigon's "Shiju Bao" published an editorial openly supporting Ngo Dinh Diem's unilateral measures, clamoring that overseas Chinese must "assume obligations" to the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities. Sources revealed that Ngo Dinh Diem is expanding the South Vietnamese army. Once he forces overseas Chinese to become Vietnamese citizens, he can expand the source of soldiers and forcibly conscript overseas Chinese into the South Vietnamese army in the name of "assuming obligations."

The South Vietnamese authorities' measures to force overseas Chinese to naturalize have aroused opposition and panic throughout the overseas Chinese community in South Vietnam. According to travelers who recently left South Vietnam, most overseas Chinese are trying to get their sons born in Vietnam out of South Vietnam. Overseas Chinese who previously moved to South Vietnam from Cambodia and Laos are also preparing to move back to their original places of residence.

### 南越当局想剥夺华侨中国国籍  片面颁布法令强迫华侨“归化”

    南越当局想剥夺华侨中国国籍
    片面颁布法令强迫华侨“归化”
    新华社河内6日电　西贡消息：吴庭艳当局最近颁布了一项强迫华侨归化的法令。它规定凡是在越南出生的华侨，包括那些在这项法令签署以前出生的人在内，都要算为越南籍，据估计，这项法令将剥夺约五十万华侨的中国国籍。
    吴庭艳的报纸还解释说，这个强迫归化的法令也适用于在南越境外求学的在越南出生的华侨学生，“不论他们要不要”。
    在这项法令颁布以后，南越当局立即停止发给在越南出生的华侨以外侨身份证，并且规定初生婴孩必须以越南名字登记。
    这一个片面强迫华侨归化的措施使吴庭艳当局最近限制和迫害华侨的措施达到新的顶点。吴庭艳当局曾经颁布法令要华侨商人必须用越文或法文记账，限制华侨申请领出入口商执照等等。
    西贡“时局报”发表社论公开支持吴庭艳的片面措施，叫嚷华侨必须向吴庭艳当局“承担义务”。有消息透露，吴庭艳正在扩充南越军队，他一旦强迫华侨入越南籍后，就可以扩大兵源，以“承担义务”的名义把华侨强征入南越军队。
    南越当局强迫华侨归化的措施引起整个南越华侨界的反对和恐慌。据最近离开南越的旅客说，大多数华侨都在设法使他们的在越南出生的儿子逃出南越。以前由柬埔寨和老挝移居南越的华侨，也在准备迁回原来居住的地方。
