    Damxung Grassland Holds Trade Fair
    Expected Total Trade to Exceed Previous Years

    According to Xinhua News Agency, horses, cattle, and sheep abound, and merchants gather on the Damxung Grassland north of Lhasa, where tens of thousands of herdsmen are participating in the trade fair.

    In the newly formed streets between the black yak hair tents, large quantities of wool, ghee, hides, ox tails, mountain products, medicinal materials and other famous livestock products and special products from the Tibetan pastoral areas are being sold. Smiling herdsmen women are choosing colorful miscellaneous goods and favorite ornaments at the stalls. The trade team sent by the Heihe Branch of the Tibet Trading General Company to participate in the trade fair sold goods worth more than 2,800 yuan and purchased more than 5,500 jin of wool on the first day of business. Every autumn, when the weather is clear and the cattle and horses are strong, the herdsmen on the Tibetan Plateau often hold such trade fairs in various places. According to old herdsmen familiar with the Damxung Grassland trade fair over the years, due to the stability of people's lives and the reduction of livestock diseases, the total trade volume of this year's trade fair will greatly exceed any year before liberation.

    This trade fair started on August 22 and will last for about a month.

    当雄草原举行贸易大会
    预计贸易总额将超过往年
    据新华社讯　在拉萨北部的当雄草原上，马、牛、羊成群，商贩云集，上万的牧民正在参加这里的贸易大会。
    在黑色牛毛帐篷之间新形成的街道里，出售着大量的羊毛、酥油、兽皮、牛尾、山货、药材等西藏牧区著名的畜产品和特产品。喜笑颜开的牧民妇女们，纷纷在货摊上选购五颜六色的零星货物和心爱的装饰品。西藏贸易总公司黑河分公司派来参加贸易大会的贸易小组，在开始营业的第一天，就销售了价值两千八百多元的货物，收购了五千五百多斤羊毛。每逢秋高气爽，牛肥马壮的季节，西藏高原上的牧民们常常在各地举行这样的贸易大会。据熟悉当雄草原历年贸易大会情况的老牧民谈，由于人民生活安定，牲畜疫病减少，今年贸易大会的贸易总额将大大超过解放前的任何一年。
    这个贸易大会是从8月22日开始的，将举行一个月左右。
