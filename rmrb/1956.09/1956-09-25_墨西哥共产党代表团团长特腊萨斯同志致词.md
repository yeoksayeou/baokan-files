Dear Comrades,

    Please allow us to convey the warm congratulations of the Central Committee of the Mexican Communist Party to the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, and through the Congress, to convey the friendly and united respect of the Mexican communists, workers, and the best elements of the Mexican people to the Chinese communists, workers, and Chinese people who have heroically created and are creating one of the greatest victories of Marxism-Leninism in the world – the victory of the great Chinese revolution and the smooth development of socialist construction.

    The Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China is not only a remarkable event of great historical significance for the Chinese people and for the continued development of the great cause of socialist construction in China, but also a remarkable event of great historical significance for the people of the world in their struggle for peace, democracy, national independence, and socialism. The resolutions of the Congress will greatly strengthen these struggles.

    The achievements and victories of the Chinese people, and the sound and reliable prospects for new and greater progress in the cause of building a powerful socialist country, as pointed out by Comrade Liu Shaoqi in the report of the Central Committee, powerfully inspire the struggle of the working masses, the Mexican people, and the Mexican Communist Party for peace, democracy, and national liberation from imperialist oppression.

    We sincerely hope that the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China will achieve full and complete success in its historic work and in implementing the resolutions of the Congress.

    Under the leadership of the long-tested and experienced Communist Party, the Chinese people defeated imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism forever in 1949. In the surging tide of the great socialist revolution, the Chinese people resolutely took steps last year to realize the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce. The situation of the Chinese working class, peasants, working masses, and all the Chinese people has fundamentally changed. This guarantees their welfare and happiness, and also guarantees the success of the cause of building China into a powerful socialist country with the help of the great socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. China has become an invincible fortress of peace and independence for the people of Asia and the world.

    Conversely, the Mexican people still live under the oppression and exploitation of U.S. imperialism. Our country has suffered all the disasters caused by the imperialist policies of subjugation and plunder of the peoples of various countries. In the past, U.S. imperialism attacked and invaded Mexico several times. Due to a predatory war by the United States, the United States seized more than half of Mexico's land. The current rule of U.S. monopoly capitalists is the fundamental cause of our people's poverty, exploitation, backwardness, and increasing hardship. As a result of the control and increasing penetration of U.S. financial monopoly capital and interference in our country's internal affairs, the national economy is being undermined, and its main sectors are being occupied. Foreign trade is monopolized by U.S. capitalists, and Mexico has become an exporter of cheap raw materials and cheap labor that is cruelly exploited in the United States, and an importer of U.S. manufactured goods at high prices. Our country has suffered the economic aggression of U.S. financial groups and is a victim of the continuous dumping of U.S. goods. Due to obedience to the interests of the U.S. exploitation, colonial, and war-preparation policies implemented in Mexico and Latin America, democratic freedoms, sovereignty, and national independence have been trampled on and destroyed.

    The result of U.S. imperialism's penetration and rule in Mexico not only makes the working class suffer from high exploitation, makes the peasants fall into extreme poverty, and puts the people in an extremely miserable situation, but also affects and reflects the situation of other social classes, such as the national bourgeoisie and the petty bourgeoisie. At present, more and more national capitalists are being squeezed out by large U.S. capitalists and are heading towards bankruptcy.

    All aspects of public opinion and struggle in our country are increasingly clearly expressing the need to fundamentally change the current situation, to rescue Mexico from the rule of U.S. imperialism, and to rescue the country from destruction, political subjugation, and the war that the U.S. imperialist bloc wants to cause.

    The Mexican people, like the people of all Latin American countries, will not submit to the conspiracies of imperialism. Its struggle for national independence and liberation has begun, and this struggle is growing and developing day by day. Nothing can stop this historical progress. The struggle for national independence and liberation is bound to be victorious, just as the great Chinese revolution has already achieved victory.

    In this vital struggle of our people, the Mexican Communist Party is fighting for a path that is the only guarantee for the victory of the cause of national independence and liberation—uniting all national and patriotic forces in a broad national liberation democratic united front—and calls for fighting for this path. In this united front, the working class should play a decisive and leading role, should form the strongest alliance with the peasants, and should actively involve the national bourgeoisie and other classes and social strata who are prepared to fight for Mexico's independence and development in this movement of national salvation and progress.

    The international situation places this struggle of our people in a more favorable position. If the people who are still suffering from imperialist oppression are closer and more confident of achieving victory today than at any time in the past, then this should be attributed to the victory of the great October Socialist Revolution, to the heroism of the workers and people of the Soviet Union, and to the great achievements of the Soviet Union in socialist and communist construction. This should be attributed to the infinitely broad new prospects opened up by the resolutions of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union for the struggle for peace, the unity of the working class, the united front of all anti-imperialist democratic forces, national independence, and socialism. The Communist Party of China, in leading the Chinese people to complete liberation and socialist construction, has set a brilliant example of vividly and creatively applying the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism in the specific context of the Chinese revolution, providing us with new and rich revolutionary experience, providing us with convenience, and further expanding the prospects for our victorious struggle against imperialist oppression and for national independence and peace. Thank you, comrades! Thank you for this invaluable help.

    Long live the glorious Communist Party of China!
    Long live the friendship between the Mexican people and the people of the People's Republic of China!
    Glory to the invincible doctrine of Marxism-Leninism!

### 墨西哥共产党代表团团长特腊萨斯同志致词

专栏：

    墨西哥共产党代表团团长特腊萨斯同志致词亲爱的同志们：
    请允许我们把墨西哥共产党中央委员会热烈的祝贺转致中国共产党第八次代表大会，并且通过大会，把墨西哥的共产党员、劳动者和人民中间的优秀分子的友好和团结的敬意，转致英勇地创造了并正在创造马克思列宁主义在世界范围内的最伟大的胜利之一——中国伟大的革命的胜利和社会主义建设的顺利发展——的中国共产党员、劳动者和中国人民。
    中国共产党第八次代表大会不仅对中国人民、对中国社会主义建设的伟大事业的继续发展是一个具有重大的历史意义的卓越的大事，而且对全世界人民争取和平、民主、民族独立和社会主义的斗争也是一件具有重大的历史意义的卓越的大事。大会的决议将大大地加强这些斗争。
    中国人民的成就和胜利，以及刘少奇同志在中央委员会的报告中所指出的那些在建设强大的社会主义国家的事业中新的和更大的进展的稳妥可靠的远景，都有力地鼓舞着劳动群众、墨西哥人民和墨西哥共产党争取和平、民主和摆脱帝国主义压迫的民族解放的斗争。
    我们衷心地希望中国共产党第八次代表大会在它的具有历史意义的工作中和实现大会的决议中获得充分的圆满的成功。
    中国人民在久经锻炼和经验丰富的共产党的领导下，在一九四九年永远地击败了帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义。在伟大的社会主义革命汹涌高涨的浪潮中，中国人民在去年坚决地采取步骤来实现农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造。中国工人阶级、农民、劳动群众和全体中国人民的情况根本地改变了。这样就保证了他们的福利和幸福，也保证了在以苏联为首的伟大的社会主义阵营的帮助下，把中国建设成为一个强大的社会主义国家这一事业的成功。中国已经成为亚洲和全世界人民的和平和独立的不可战胜的堡垒。
    相反地，墨西哥人民还是生活在受美帝国主义压迫和剥削的状态下。我们的国家遭受到帝国主义使各国人民屈从的统治和掠夺政策所造成的一切灾难。在过去，美帝国主义曾经几次袭击并且侵入墨西哥。由于一次美国的掠夺性的战争，美国夺去了墨西哥一大半的土地。美国垄断资本家目前的统治是我国人民贫困、受剥削、落后和日益艰苦的根本原因。由于美国金融垄断资本的控制和日益渗入的结果、由于对我国内政的干涉，国民经济被破坏，它的主要的部门被侵占。对外贸易被美国资本家所垄断，墨西哥沦为廉价原料和在美国受到残酷剥削的廉价劳动力的输出国，和以高价购买美国的制成品的输入国。我们国家遭受了美国财团的经济侵略，是美国商品不断倾销的牺牲品。由于服从美国在墨西哥和拉丁美洲所实行的剥削政策、殖民政策和备战政策的利益，民主的自由权利、主权和民族独立受到了蹂躏和破坏。
    美帝国主义在墨西哥的渗入和统治的结果不仅使工人阶级受到了高度的剥削、使农民陷于极端的贫困，并使人民处于极其悲惨的境地，而且也影响到并且反映在其它社会阶级，如民族资产阶级和小资产阶级的情况。目前，越来越多的民族资本家受到美国大资本家的排挤而趋向破产。
    我国各方面的舆论和斗争，都越来越明显地表示要求根本改变目前情况，必须把墨西哥从美帝国主义的统治下拯救出来，把国家从毁灭、政治上的屈服以及美国帝国主义集团所想引起的战争中拯救出来。
    墨西哥人民，像所有拉丁美洲国家的人民一样，是不会屈从帝国主义的阴谋的。它的争取民族独立和解放的斗争已经展开了，这个斗争正在一天天的成长和发展。没有任何东西能够制止这一历史进展。争取民族独立和解放的斗争是必然会胜利的，正如伟大的中国革命已经取得了胜利一样。
    在我国人民这一个生死攸关的斗争里，墨西哥共产党正为争取一条唯一保证民族独立和解放事业胜利的道路——把一切民族的和爱国的力量团结在一条广泛的民族解放的民主统一战线里——而斗争，并号召为这条道路而斗争。在这条统一战线里，工人阶级应该起决定性的和领导的作用，应该和农民结成最牢固的联盟，并应该使民族资产阶级和其它准备为墨西哥的独立和发展而斗争的阶级和各社会阶层，积极参加这一救亡和民族进步的运动。
    国际形势使我国人民的这一斗争处于更加有利的地位。假如说仍然受帝国主义压迫的人民今天比过去任何时候都更接近并更有把握取得胜利的话，那末这应该归功于伟大的十月社会主义革命的胜利，归功于苏联的劳动者和人民的英雄主义，归功于苏联社会主义和共产主义建设的巨大成就。这应该归功于苏联共产党第二十次代表大会的决议为争取和平、工人阶级的团结、一切反帝国主义民主力量的统一战线、民族独立和社会主义的斗争而开辟的无限宽广的新前途。中国共产党在把中国人民胜利引向彻底解放和社会主义建设的时候，树立了在中国革命的具体情况下生动而创造性地运用马克思列宁主义普遍真理的辉煌榜样，为我们提供了新的丰富的革命经验，也给了我们便利，并且为我们更扩大了反对帝国主义压迫、争取民族独立与和平的胜利斗争的前途。谢谢你们，同志们！感谢你们这个极有价值的帮助。
    光荣的中国共产党万岁！
    墨西哥人民和中华人民共和国人民之间的友谊万岁！
    光荣归于战无不胜的马克思列宁主义学说！（附图片）
