Nehru's "The Discovery of India," written by the Prime Minister of the Republic of India, Jawaharlal Nehru, has been published in Chinese translation. Our readers are reading and studying this famous work with great interest.

This book was written twelve years ago. At that time, the clouds of war loomed over the world, and mankind was struggling in bloodshed. India at that time was in a very difficult situation. The Indian people were eager to defeat the fascist aggressors and hoped to contribute to the struggle to establish a peaceful and just post-war new international order. In early August 1942, the National Congress Party, headed by Gandhi and Nehru, passed the famous resolution demanding that Britain "Quit India." Immediately, the colonial government arrested all the leaders of the National Congress Party.

Nehru wrote in the preface to the Chinese translation:

"Because I could not act at that time, I had to recall the past and try to glimpse the future. I wanted to understand my motherland for whose freedom I was fighting."

The author begins with a description of life and thoughts in prison (Chapter 1), then adds a section about his wife's death and foreign travels that were not covered in his "Autobiography" (Chapter 2), and then talks about his intellectual "exploration" to "understand India" (Chapter 3). From Chapter 4 to Chapter 9, the author depicts the various aspects of Indian history for the reader, in which the description of British aggression and colonial rule, as well as the Indian national independence struggle, especially the activities of the National Congress Party, occupies about half of the entire historical narrative (Chapter 7 to Chapter 9 "The Final Phase"). In the last chapter, the author returns to the "present" to "glimpse the future," and then puts forward his opinions on independent India (Chapter 10).

In terms of length, this book seems to be a history of India, but it is different from the history books written by general historians. The author is not displaying historical facts or narrating history, but examining history and commenting on history; more importantly, he is using the past to explain the "present" and projecting his vision into the "future."

Such a work naturally includes the author's views on many important aspects of Indian history, and these views are closely related to his views on the "present" and "future." These views and propositions show some important viewpoints. These views, propositions, and viewpoints, as well as the knowledge provided in the book about India's society, politics, economy, science, philosophy, religion, literature, art, and other aspects, arouse our interest, perhaps even more intense interest.

Naturally, there are many opinions in the book that are the same as ours, and there are also some viewpoints that are different from ours. However, we can have the same interest in reading those parts that agree with our viewpoints and those parts that disagree with our viewpoints. This is because we feel the need to have a better understanding of our neighboring country, and increasing understanding is an important factor in strengthening friendship.

When we read this book, we cannot help but feel the author's deep friendship for China. There are many places in the book that mention the friendly relationship between China and India over the past two thousand years, in which there have only been cultural exchanges and no wars. When we read these places, we feel as if we are listening to the conversation of an old friend who cherishes friendship, which resonates in our hearts.

The author uses an entire section to specifically narrate the history of friendly exchanges between China and India. (Chapter 5, Section 15) At the end of this section, the author writes in a poetic tone:

"The giant wheel of fortune turns round and round, India and China gaze at each other, arousing a feeling of nostalgic recollection. New pilgrims are crossing or flying over the high mountains that divide the two countries, carrying a mission of joy and friendship, and are creating new and lasting friendship." (Page 247)

This can be said to be a prediction of Sino-Indian friendship twelve years ago.

When we read this book, we get a strong impression of the author's nationalist feelings. His love for his motherland, his exposure of the various evils of colonial rule, and his promotion of the national independence movement are all things we deeply sympathize with. When analyzing the poverty and backwardness of modern India, he pointed out that the root of all disasters was British colonial rule over India. The main spirit that runs through the book is to oppose colonial rule, value national culture, strive for national independence, and pursue social progress.

The author praises his country's long, rich, and beautiful national traditions, but he does not shy away from its shortcomings (such as the caste system), and at the same time, he does not despise and reject the advantages of other nations. His opposition to colonialism and acts of aggression is not only focused on his own country, but also extends to the entire world. He condemns Fascist Italy, Nazi Germany, and militarist Japan in the same way as he condemns colonialist Britain. This is because what he pursues is not only national independence, but also the further demand that all mankind and all nations can be independent, free, and friendly to each other.

When the author mentioned the socialist revolution and the Soviet Union, he wrote: "I have no doubt that the Soviet revolution has greatly advanced human society and ignited an unquenchable flame, which has laid the foundation for a new civilization to which the entire world is heading." (Page 20) He also said: "The study of Marx and Lenin has had a strong influence in my mind and has helped me to observe history and current affairs with new insights." (Ibid.) "I can accept many philosophical views of Marxists without any difficulty." (Ibid.) But he also believes that Marxist philosophy "has not completely satisfied me, nor has it answered all the questions in my heart."

In this book, the author not only introduces the various schools of ancient Indian philosophy (including materialism), but also talks about his own philosophical thoughts and his views on the world and life. These places may be more difficult for our general readers to understand. But precisely because they are different from ours, they are worthy of our attention and require our study. I also feel that it should be pointed out that this philosophical viewpoint is not the author's alone, but is representative. Generally speaking, from Rom Mohan Roy, the founder of modern Indian thought, to many important figures headed by Gandhi in modern times, have more or less accepted this philosophical viewpoint. This is Vedanta philosophy, or more precisely, Vedanta philosophy as interpreted by Shankara more than a thousand years ago, and re-explained in modern times. Of course, the statements of these people will not be completely the same, for example, Gandhi emphasized "non-violence," while Tagore emphasized "truth is one and the roads are different," but their philosophical basis is "non-dualism" (Shankara's theory is found on pages 234 to 238 of this book). Vedanta philosophy plays a huge role in modern Indian thought.

The basic viewpoint of Vedanta idealism philosophy is "non-dual," which can be said in modern terms as "unity in diversity." "Non-dual" is naturally "unique," but its method is to use various contradictory statements (such as the quotation on page 234) to explain that there is no contradiction, to see "truth" from "illusion," to affirm "sameness," and at the same time to actually acknowledge "difference," to put forward "two," and then to negate it. This is the characteristic of this theory, and it is also its difficulty to understand. Naturally, when interpreting and applying this theory, everyone has their own emphasis and their own views, and their thoughts and even behaviors are often very different, but they still consider themselves or are considered to belong to the same school of philosophy to some extent.

Although Nehru did not claim to be a Vedanta philosopher, the basic philosophical viewpoint expressed in this book, especially in his view of history, is still of this type. He tried to explain how the Indian nation has maintained unity in diversity for thousands of years. Even when talking about the modern part, he never forgets to point out that we must move from chaos to harmony and seek unity from contradictions.

Needless to say, what interests us most in this book is still in the political aspect and the historical knowledge aspect, not in the philosophical aspect. However, this book is Nehru's work in which he talks the most about philosophical thoughts. If we can pay attention to understanding such philosophical thoughts, and can further understand its production background and the role it plays in real life, we will learn more from it.

Finally, I must also mention a characteristic of this book, that is, the author's unique writing style, his erudition, and his keenness of thought. He has the literary talent to express his knowledge, thoughts, and feelings well. From his works, we can see how rich he is in literary cultivation. He is familiar with Indian literature and Western literature, and is also very interested in Chinese literature. He has repeatedly quoted Li Bai's poems in his "Autobiography." (This book also quotes the words of Confucius and Lao Tzu.) All of these give this work a style like a literary work, making people feel as if they are listening to an informal conversation with a close friend.

The author said in the "Preface to the Chinese Translation":

"I hope that reading this book will enable the great Chinese people to understand our country; for the great Chinese people, we cherish their friendship, and we hope that our relationship will become closer and closer."

We believe that the publication of the Chinese translation of this book will definitely help us to understand our neighbor India, thereby enhancing the great Sino-Indian friendship built on the Five Principles (Panchsheel).

    尼赫鲁的“印度的发现”
    金克木
    印度共和国总理贾瓦哈拉尔·尼赫鲁著的“印度的发现”的中译本出版了。我国读者怀着极大的兴趣来阅读和研究这部名著。
    这本著作是十二年前写的。当时战云笼罩着世界，人类正在血泊中苦斗着。当时的印度处在一种非常困难的状况之下。印度人民渴望击败法西斯侵略者，热烈希望在建立一个和平的符合正义的战后国际新局势的斗争中贡献一分力量。1942年8月初，以甘地、尼赫鲁为首的国民大会党通过了要求英国“退出印度”的著名决议。立刻，殖民主义者的政府就把国民大会党的领袖全部逮捕了。
    尼赫鲁在为中译本写的序言中写道：
    “因为那时我不能有所行动，我不得不回忆过去，并试图窥探将来。我想了解我为其自由而奋斗的我的祖国。”
    作者从描写监狱中的生活与思想（第一章）开始，又补叙了他的“自传”中未及写到的一段关于他的夫人逝世和国外旅行（第二章），然后说到他为了“了解印度”而进行的思想上的“探索”（第三章）。从第四章到第九章，作者在读者面前描绘了印度历史的各方面的面貌，其中叙述英国的侵略和殖民统治以及印度民族独立斗争，特别是国民大会党的活动的篇幅，约占全部历史叙述的一半（第七章至第九章“最后阶段”）。在最后一章中作者回到“现在”来“窥探将来”，接着提出了他关于独立的印度的意见（第十章）。
    从篇幅上看来，本书好像是一部印度的历史，但是它却和一般历史家所写的历史书不一样。作者不是在陈列历史事实，叙述历史，而是在考察历史，评论历史；更重要的，他是依据过去来说明“现在”，并且把眼光投射到“将来”。
    这样的一部著作自然就包括了作者对于印度历史上许多重要方面的见解，而这些见解又和他对“现在”及“将来”的主张有密切联系。这些见解和主张表现出一些重要的观点。这些见解、主张、观点和书中所提供的关于印度的社会、政治、经济、科学、哲学、宗教、文学、艺术等各方面知识一样引起我们的兴趣，也许还是更加浓厚的兴趣。
    自然，书中有不少意见和我们的相同，同时也有某些观点和我们的不一样。但是，我们读那些观点和我们一致的部分和读那些观点和我们不一致的部分，都能有同样的兴趣。这是因为我们感到需要对我们的邻邦有更好的了解，而增进了解是加强友谊的重要因素。
    我们读这本著作时不能不感到作者对于中国的深厚友情。书里有许多处提到中印两国两千年来只有文化来往从未兵戎相见的友好关系。读到这些地方我们感到好像听到一位珍视友谊的老朋友的谈话，在我们心中引起共鸣。
    作者用了整整一节的篇幅专叙述中国和印度友好来往的历史。（第五章第十五节）在这一节的末尾，作者以诗意的笔调写道：
    “世运巨轮，周而复始，印度与中国彼此互相瞻望着，引起满怀的忆旧心情。新的香客正越过或飞过两国分界的高山，带着欢欣友好的使命，正在创造着新的持久友谊。”（第247页）
    这可以说是十二年前对于今天中印友谊的预言。
    我们读这本书时对于作者的民族主义思想感情获得强烈的印象。他对自己祖国的热爱，对殖民主义统治的各种邪恶的揭发，对民族独立运动的宣扬，这些都是我们深感同情的。他在分析近代印度的贫困和落后时，指出一切灾难的根源是英国对印度的殖民统治。贯串在全书中的主要精神就是反对殖民统治，重视民族文化，争取祖国独立，追求社会进步。
    作者赞扬自己祖国的悠久、丰富而且优美的民族传统，却并不讳言其中的缺点（例如种姓制度），同时他也不轻视和排斥其他民族的优点。他反对殖民主义和侵略行为，也不仅仅着眼在本国，而是遍及全世界。他对法西斯意大利、纳粹德国、军国主义日本，也和对殖民主义英国一样加以谴责。这是因为他所追求的并不只限于本国独立，还进一步要求全人类各民族都能独立自由而且互相友好。
    作者在提到社会主义革命和苏联时曾写道：“我不怀疑苏维埃的革命把人类社会大大地向前推进了一步，燃起了不可扑灭的熊熊火焰，它为整个世界所奔赴的新文明奠定了基础。”（第20页）他又说：“对马克思和列宁的研究在我心中产生了一个强有力的影响，并且帮助了我用新的见解来观察历史与时事。”（同上）“我能够毫无困难地接受马克思主义者的很多哲学观点。”（同上）可是他又认为马克思主义哲学“没有使我完全满意，也没有解答我心中所有的问题。”
    作者在本书中不但介绍了印度古代哲学各派（包括唯物主义），而且还谈到了他自己的哲学思想，他对世界、人生的见解。这些地方可能是我国一般读者感到较难理解的。可是正因为和我们的不同，也就值得我们注意，需要我们研究。我觉得还应该指出，这种哲学观点并不是作者一个人的，而是有代表性的。大体上可以说，从印度近代思想的创始者罗姆·摩罕·罗易起，直到现代的以甘地为首的许多重要人物，都或多或少接受这种哲学观点。这就是吠檀多哲学，或则更确切地说，是经过一千多年前的商羯罗解释的，又在近代经过一番新的说明的吠檀多哲学。当然这些人的说法不会彼此完全相同，例如甘地强调“非暴力”，而泰戈尔着重“真理唯一而道路不一”，但是他们的哲学根据都是“不二论”（商羯罗的理论见本书第234页到第238页）。吠檀多哲学在近代印度思想中是起着巨大的作用的。
    吠檀多派唯心论哲学的基本观点就是“不二”，用现代的话可以说是“纷歧中的统一”。“不二”，自然就是“唯一”，但是它的方法是用种种矛盾说法（如第234页引文）以说明究竟不矛盾，由“幻”以见“真”，肯定了“同”，同时也在实际上承认了“异”，提出了“二”来，然后加以否定。这是这一理论的特点，也是它的难于理解之处。自然在解说和运用这一理论时，每个人有所偏重，有自己的见解，他们的思想以至行为也就往往有很大的不同，可是他们仍多少自认为或被认为属于同一派哲学。
    虽然尼赫鲁并没有自居为吠檀多派哲学家，但是本书中所表现的哲学基本观点，特别是在对历史的看法上，仍然是这一类型。他力图说明几千年来印度民族如何在纷歧中保持着统一。就是在说到现代的部分，他也处处不忘指出要由纷乱走向和谐，要从矛盾求得一致。
    不用说，本书中最引起我们兴趣的还是在政治方面和历史知识方面，而不在哲学方面。不过本书是尼赫鲁的著作中说到哲学思想最多的一部，如果我们能够注意了解这样的哲学思想，并且能更进一步了解它的产生背景和在现实生活中所起的作用，我们会由此了解到更多的东西。
    最后还不能不提到本书的一个特色，那就是作者所特有的文章风格，他的学识的渊博和思想的敏锐。他有善于表达自己的知识、思想、感情的文学才能。从他的著作中可以看到他是多么富于文学修养。他熟悉印度文学和西方文学，还对中国文学很有兴趣，在“自传”中一再引过李白的诗句。（本书中也引用了孔子和老子的话。）所有这些就赋予这部著作一种像文学作品一样的风格，使人读起来仿佛是在听着一位亲切的友人的不拘形迹的谈话。
    作者在“中译本序言”中说：
    “我希望：读这本书可以使伟大的中国人民对我国有所了解；对于伟大的中国人民，我们珍爱他们的友谊，我们希望和他们的关系日益紧密。”
    我们相信，本书中译本的出版一定会有助于我们对邻邦印度的了解，从而增进建于五项原则（潘查希拉）之上的伟大的中印友谊。
