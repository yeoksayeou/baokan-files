Production Self-Salvation Has a Way
　　By Our Correspondent Gao Changren

　　She Tianqiao Township in Shaodong County, Hunan Province, is a hilly area, and farmers fear drought the most. The two major droughts of 1921 and 1934 left painful memories in the minds of the older farmers. At that time, the rice seedlings in the fields yielded nothing, and the farmers, with their children, carried burdens to Guilin, Changsha, and other places to escape the famine.

　　This year, She Tianqiao Township has not had heavy rain from mid-June to mid-August. Even the small river called Zhengshui, which runs through the entire township, has dried up. The severity of the drought is no less than in 1934. Thanks to the township party branch leading the farmers in an intense fight against drought, a large number of intermediate rice and some late rice were saved, reducing the losses from the disaster compared to 1934. However, after all, the drought lasted too long. According to statistics in mid-August, the agricultural and sideline production of the township's nine agricultural cooperatives will decrease by 26.3% compared to last year. In a short period after the disaster, many farmers had feelings of pessimism and disappointment. After the township people's committee and the party general branch put forward a plan for production self-salvation, this sentiment began to change. Let me start with one cooperative.

　　Zhengshui No. 1 Cooperative is one of the cooperatives in the township that has been severely affected by the disaster. The cooperative has more than 1,800 mu of rice fields, and the grain yield has been reduced by more than 250,000 jin. The losses in sideline occupations and cash crops are also great: the loss of fish in the ponds is worth more than 1,000 yuan; last year, more than 70 mu of water chestnuts were planted, but this year, due to the drought, only 23 mu were planted. The total income from agricultural and sideline occupations has decreased by 37.8% compared to last year.

　　When the reduction in production became a foregone conclusion, Chen Xingqiao, a member of the third production team, sat at home sighing all day long. He is over sixty years old. After joining the advanced cooperative this spring, he took up farm work again, which he had abandoned for five years, and was full of hope for a good harvest in the autumn. However, the fact of the loss caused by the drought was before him, how could he not worry about his future life?

　　There was also a middle peasant member of this team, Chen Ding'an, who was also in a bad mood due to the reduction in production caused by the drought. He had more than eight mu of land, and when he worked independently last year, he had a yield of 600 jin of rice per mu. He kept missing last year's good harvest and blamed the agricultural cooperative for this year's drought loss. He complained that he should not have joined the advanced cooperative and wanted to withdraw.

　　The thoughts and feelings of these two people can represent the mood of most of the members at that time; their common request was to find better ways to survive the disaster.

　　The leaders of the township and the cooperative issued a call for production self-salvation and compensation for drought losses, and formulated a plan for expanding the planting of late autumn crops and developing diversified management, pointing out the direction for all members. These two emotionally disturbed people also settled down.

　　One day, Chen Xingqiao was invited by the cooperative to participate in a forum for old farmers to specifically study the methods and plans for production and disaster relief. The cooperative proposed that expanding the planting area of ​​late autumn crops should be regarded as the main measure to compensate for the drought losses, which inspired this old farmer with experience in surviving famine. He remembered that after the great drought in 1934, his family of eleven only harvested a little over eleven dan of rice; when the grain was not enough to eat, he planted more late autumn crops. That year, he planted three mu of buckwheat, yielding two dan per mu; the radishes he planted yielded more than one hundred dan; he also planted two mu of barley to prepare for new grain early next year. That year, he ate coarse grains first, and finally ate some rice, and even saved the rice seeds for transplanting seedlings in the spring. In this way, his family did not go hungry in the disaster year.

　　The old man recalled these past events, and his pessimism and disappointment disappeared. He felt that the cooperative was planting too little buckwheat, only 150 mu, and suggested planting 250 mu. The cooperative accepted his suggestion, and the old man was even happier. A few days later, he planted buckwheat with everyone; he also often taught the young people: "If you don't want to go hungry in a famine year, you have to plant more late autumn miscellaneous grains."

　　Chen Ding'an also gave up the idea of ​​withdrawing from the cooperative and established confidence in production self-salvation. This was the result of the help of Zeng Lanfang, the deputy director of the cooperative. Zeng Lanfang lived near him and knew his feelings well. Once, during a casual conversation, Zeng Lanfang asked Chen Ding'an: "How much grain did you harvest per mu during the great drought in 1934?" Chen Ding'an said: "Don't mention it, only a little over one hundred jin per mu." Zeng Lanfang told him that although the cooperative was affected by the disaster, the yield per mu this year could still reach three hundred jin. Chen Ding'an was still dissatisfied and said: "I harvested six hundred jin per mu last year, and this year it looks like it will be reduced by half. I really shouldn't have joined the cooperative!" Zeng Lanfang asked him: "How does it compare with 1934?" Chen Ding'an said: "Compared with that year, of course, this year is still considered a good harvest; if I worked independently, I could also harvest this much." Zeng Lanfang listed many facts to show that it would be difficult to get such a harvest in the event of a major drought if one did not organize into a cooperative. For example, in the past winter and this spring, their third team alone built two large ponds, and in the drought resistance, they comprehensively planned and rationally used water. These things could not be done by individual farmers.

　　In the face of these facts, Chen Ding'an admitted the superiority of the advanced cooperative. However, he was still not confident in how to survive the disaster in the future. After Zeng Lanfang told him about the cooperative's production self-salvation plan, Chen Ding'an began to dispel the idea of ​​withdrawing from the cooperative. When rushing to plant buckwheat, he heard that as long as agricultural and sideline production is done well this year, each work day can still be divided into six or seven jiao (originally he estimated only two jiao a day); he calculated that his family has done more than two hundred work days this year, and can also be divided into two thousand jin of grain! He never mentioned withdrawing from the cooperative again and actively participated in field work.

　　In this way, the party branch and cooperative cadres of Zhengshui No. 1 Cooperative patiently educated the members on the one hand and organized the members to plant late autumn crops on the other. The cooperative's production self-salvation work is at the forefront of the entire township. In the last few days of August, the cooperative mobilized more than 270 laborers every day to cultivate sweet potatoes on the mountainsides and plant buckwheat in the early rice fields that had not been transplanted with late rice due to drought.

　　The sideline production of this cooperative has also been rapidly developed. From eight kinds of sideline occupations such as transportation, milling, and handicrafts, more than 1,900 yuan has already been earned. There are still six kinds of sideline occupations being prepared. According to the cooperative's recently revised production self-salvation plan, the total income from agricultural and sideline occupations can not only reach the level of last year, but also exceed more than 9,000 yuan.

　　Now, the nine agricultural cooperatives in She Tianqiao Township have all formulated agricultural and sideline production self-salvation plans. On August 23, there was a general heavy rain in the township, which can still increase the yield of intermediate rice and sweet potatoes in the ground, which have a later harvest season. Those late rice fields that lacked water have also been filled with enough water. The Zhengshui River, which had been dry for more than a month, is now flowing day and night again. This welcome rain after a long drought has further increased the confidence of the farmers in She Tianqiao Township in production self-salvation. On August 26, the mountains and plains were full of people rushing to plant buckwheat and hoe sweet potatoes. The actions of the nine agricultural cooperatives are gradually turning the township's production self-salvation plan into reality. Now, among the members, the mood of pessimism and disappointment has been largely reversed. The question that people are now concerned about is how to open up more production avenues and increase more income.

    生产自救有办法
    本报记者　高长任
    湖南省邵东县佘田桥乡是丘陵地区，农民最怕旱灾。1921年和1934年两次大旱灾，在老年农民的脑子里留下惨痛的记忆。那时，田里禾苗颗粒无收，农民拖儿带女，挑着担子到桂林、长沙等地去逃荒。
    今年，佘田桥乡从6月中旬到8月中旬没下过大雨，连纵贯全乡的一条名叫蒸水的小河也断流了，受旱的程度不减于1934年。由于乡里党支部领导全乡农民进行了紧张的抗旱斗争，挽救了大批中稻和一部分晚稻，使受灾的损失比1934年减轻了许多。但是，毕竟因为干旱太久，据8月中旬统计，全乡九个农业社的农副业将比去年减少26.3％。在受灾后的一个短时期，许多农民曾经产生了悲观失望的情绪。在乡人民委员会和党总支提出生产自救的计划以后，这种情绪开始转变了。让我从一个社谈起吧。
    蒸水一社是这个乡灾情比较严重的社，全社一千八百多亩稻田，减产粮食二十五万多斤。副业和经济作物的损失也很大：塘里的鱼的损失值一千多元；去年种了七十多亩荸荠，今年因天旱只种下二十三亩。全部农副业总收入比去年减少37.8％。
    当减产已成定局的时候，第三生产队的社员陈星桥整天坐在屋里唉声叹气。他是六十多岁的人，今年春天参加高级社以后，他又做起丢开了五年的农活，满指望秋天有个好收成。可是，旱灾造成损失的事实摆在他的面前，他怎么能不为以后的生活发愁呢？
    这个队还有个中农社员陈定安，也在为旱灾减产闹情绪。他有八亩多田，去年单干时曾获得每亩产六百斤稻谷的产量。他一味怀念去年的丰收，把今年旱灾的损失归罪于农业社。他埋怨自己不该参加高级社，他想退社。
    这两个人的思想情绪可以代表当时多数社员的心情；他们的共同要求，就是想更好的办法度过灾荒。
    乡和社的领导人员发出了生产自救、弥补旱灾损失的号召，制定了扩种晚秋作物、开展多种经营的计划，为全体社员指出了方向。这两个情绪不安的人，也安定下来了。
    有一天，陈星桥被社里邀请参加老农座谈会，具体研究生产救灾的办法和计划。社里提出把扩大晚秋作物种植面积当作弥补旱灾损失的主要措施，启发了这位有度荒经验的老农。他记起1934年大旱之后，他家十一口人，只收到十一担多稻谷；吃粮不够，他就多种晚秋作物。那一年，他种了三亩田荞麦，每亩收到两担；种的萝卜收了一百多担；还种了二亩大麦，准备第二年早点接上新粮。那一年，他先吃杂粮，最后才吃点谷子，还把春天下秧的谷种省下来。就这样，一家人在受灾年都没有饿肚子。
    老人回忆起这些往事，悲观失望情绪消失了。他认为社里种一百五十亩荞麦太少了，建议种到二百五十亩。社里接受了他的建议，老人更高兴了。不几天，他又和大伙一道种荞麦；还常常教训年青人说：“要想荒年不受饿，就要多种晚秋杂粮。”
    陈定安也打消了退社的念头，树立了生产自救的信心。这是社副主任曾兰芳帮助的结果。曾兰芳住在他的附近，很了解他的心情。一次闲谈的时候，曾兰芳问陈定安：“你在1934年大旱灾的时候，一亩田收好多谷？”陈定安说：“不能提，一亩田只收一百多斤。”曾兰芳告诉他，社里虽然受灾，今年一亩田的产量还可达到三百斤。陈定安仍然不满意地说：“我去年一亩田收六百斤，今年眼看要减产一半了。我真不该入社！”曾兰芳问他：同1934年比一比怎么样？陈定安说：“同那一年比，当然今年还算个好收成；我要是单干，也能收到这些。”曾兰芳列举许多事实，说明不是办社就很难在大旱的情况下得到这样的收成。比如去冬今春仅他们第三队就兴修了两口大塘，抗旱中全面规划合理用水，这些事情，都不是单干农民能办到的。
    在这些事实面前，陈定安承认了高级社的优越性。可是，对于以后如何度过灾荒，他还是信心不足。曾兰芳把社里的生产自救的计划告诉他以后，陈定安开始打消了退社的念头。抢种荞麦的时候，他听说今年只要农业副业生产搞得好，每个劳动日还可分到六七角钱（原来他估计只有两角多钱一天）；他一计算，他家今年共做了二百多个劳动日，还可分到两千斤粮食呢！他再也不提退社了，积极地参加了田间劳动。
    就这样，蒸水一社的党支部和社干部们一面耐心地教育社员，一面组织社员种晚秋作物。这个社的生产自救工作走在全乡的最前面。在8月末那几天，这个社每天都出动了二百七十多个劳动力，在山坡上培育红薯，在因干旱没有插上晚秧的早稻田里种荞麦。
    这个社的副业生产也迅速展开了。从运输、磨面、手工业等八种副业中，已经收入了一千九百多元。还有六种副业正在准备做。按照社里最近修订的生产自救计划，农业副业总收入不仅能达到去年的水平，还可以超过九千多元。
    现在，佘田桥乡九个农业社都制定了农业副业的生产自救计划。8月23日，全乡普降一场透雨，对于收割季节较迟的中稻和地里的红薯，还能增加一些产量。那些缺水的晚稻田里，又装足了足够的水。断流一个多月的蒸水河，又日夜不停地流动了。这场久旱之后的喜雨，更增加了佘田桥乡农民生产自救的信心。8月26日一天，满山遍野都是抢种荞麦和薅红薯的人群。九个农业社的行动，把全乡生产自救的计划逐步变成事实。现在，在社员中，悲观失望的情绪已经大部分扭转了。人们现在关心的问题，是怎样开辟更多的生产门路，增加更多的收入。
