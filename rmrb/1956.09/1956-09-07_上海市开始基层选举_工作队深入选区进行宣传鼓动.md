Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, September 5th: The vast majority of districts in Shanghai have begun grassroots elections.

　　As of today, 285 work teams composed of more than 4,000 cadres have successively entered the election districts to carry out propaganda, mobilization, and voter registration work. More than 1,800 lane activists and thousands of staff members from factories, enterprises, and government organizations have also automatically participated in the election propaganda work.

　　This year's voter registration work is proceeding faster than in 1953. Based on the specific conditions of their districts and the principle of not hindering both elections and production, the district election committees have flexibly adopted three registration methods: setting up stations, going door-to-door, and public announcements. Some elderly women and women busy with housework who entrusted others to register in 1953 are now bringing their household registration booklets to the registration stations themselves. Some landlords and elements who were originally under control for disrupting revolutionary order, who have shown relatively good performance in the past and have now, with the consent of the masses and in accordance with the law, had their class status changed or their control lifted, have also undergone voter registration this time. Some people under control for disrupting revolutionary order who have performed meritorious services have also had their control lifted early this time and have been granted the right to vote and stand for election in accordance with the law.

　　In order to promote the smooth progress of grassroots elections and legally protect the people's electoral rights, the Shanghai municipal and district judicial organs are also currently making preparations for commending good people and good deeds, handling voter eligibility appeals, and trying bad people who disrupt the elections.

    上海市开始基层选举
    工作队深入选区进行宣传鼓动
    新华社上海5日电　上海市的绝大多数区已经开始基层选举。
    到今天为止，由四千多名干部组成的二百八十五个工作队已经先后进入选区进行宣传鼓动和选民登记工作。一千八百多名里弄积极分子和数以千计的工厂、企业、机关等单位的工作人员，也自动参加了选举的宣传工作。
    今年的选民登记工作比1953年时进行得快。各区选举委员会根据本区的具体情况和选举、生产两不误的原则，灵活地采用设站、上门、发表等三种登记方式，在1953年时托人登记的一些年老和家务忙的妇女，这次都纷纷带着户口簿，亲自到登记站登记。有一部分地主和原来是破坏革命秩序被管制的分子，在过去的一定时期中表现比较好，现在经过群众同意，并且依法改变了成份或撤销了管制以后，这次也进行了选民登记。在破坏革命秩序被管制的分子中有一些立了功的人，这次还提前撤销管制，依法给予选举权和被选举权。
    为了推动基层选举的顺利进行，从法律上保障人民的选举权利，上海市级和区级的司法机关最近还正在进行有关表扬好人好事、选民资格申诉以及坏人破坏选举审理等准备工作。
