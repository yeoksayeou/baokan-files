Xinhua News Agency, Shenzhen, September 6th: Xinhua News Agency reporter reports from Shenzhen: On the fourth day of the Hong Kong British authorities' re-implementation of the so-called "entry-exit balance" unreasonable measures, the number of compatriots forced to remain in Shenzhen and unable to go to Hong Kong has rapidly increased to over six hundred. The Overseas Chinese Service and other hotels near the Shenzhen Railway Station are already packed with residents unreasonably blocked here.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, September 6th: Forty-eight representatives of returned overseas Chinese and their families in Guangzhou unanimously demanded at a gathering today that the Hong Kong British authorities immediately rescind the unreasonable measures of the so-called "entry-exit balance."

Ant Meihou, director of the Guangzhou Returned Overseas Chinese Federation, said indignantly: The implementation of the "entry-exit balance" method is tantamount to restricting the exchanges between compatriots in Hong Kong and the mainland, and hindering the contact between overseas Chinese and the motherland. This is something we absolutely cannot tolerate. The Hong Kong British authorities should respect the traditional customs of the Chinese people and the interests of compatriots in both places, and immediately revoke this unreasonable decision.

Liu Yiying, a returned overseas Chinese from Indonesia, pointed out at the meeting that for more than a hundred years, Hong Kong has been a place where overseas Chinese often enter and exit. More than 90 percent of the residents there are Chinese. According to traditional customs and the status of Hong Kong, the Hong Kong British authorities have absolutely no right to make such an irrational decision.

    六百多人被迫留在深圳不能进入香港
    广州归侨等集会要求英国当局撤销无理限制
    据新华社广州6日电　新华社记者自深圳报道：在香港英国当局从新实行所谓“出入平衡”的无理措施的第四天，被迫滞留在深圳不能前往香港的同胞已经迅速增加到六百多人。深圳车站附近的华侨服务社和其他旅社都已挤满了被无理阻挡在这里的住客。
    据新华社广州6日电　广州市归侨和侨眷代表四十八人，今天在一次集会上一致要求香港英国当局立即撤销所谓“出入平衡”的无理措施。
    广州归国华侨联谊会主任蚁美厚愤慨地说：实行“出入平衡”办法，无异限制香港与内地同胞的来往，阻难海外侨胞和祖国的联系，这是我们万不能容忍的。香港英国当局应该尊重中国人民的传统习惯和两地同胞的利益，立即撤销这种不合情理的决定。
    印度尼西亚归国华侨刘宜应在会上指出，百多年来，香港是华侨经常出入经过的地方，那里居住着的百分之九十以上都是中国人，按照传统习惯和香港的地位来说，香港英国当局完全没有权利作出这样缺乏理智的决定。
