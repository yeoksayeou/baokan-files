Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, September 1st: The Committee on German Unification held a press conference in Berlin on August 31 regarding the banning of the German Communist Party (DKP).

Dr. F. Kaul, one of the defense lawyers for the DKP in the West German trial of communists, said at the press conference that the West German Federal Constitutional Court's declaration banning the DKP was a violation of the West German constitution.

Kaul said: The DKP banned by West Germany is precisely the party that Hitler once persecuted. This party once led the anti-fascist movement and suffered countless sacrifices.

Kaul pointed out that although the Federal Constitutional Court admitted in its judgment on the DKP that "for the unification of Germany, the legal existence of the DKP is necessary," it still declared the DKP banned according to the wishes of the West German government. This proves that banning the DKP has made the reunification of Germany impossible, which violates the fundamental interests of the German nation.

Kaul also pointed out that West Germany announced the ban on the DKP almost simultaneously with the implementation of universal conscription, which is not accidental. This clearly shows that banning the DKP is a serious threat to peace and European security.

Kaul called on the West German people to demand that the West German Federal Parliament discuss the issue of revoking the illegal ban on the DKP in order to eliminate the threat to world peace.

Kröger, another defense lawyer for the DKP, emphasized at the press conference that the West German Federal Constitutional Court's judgment failed to cite any facts or actions in violation by the DKP. Its judgment was based solely on the fact that the DKP is a Marxist party.

    德共辩护律师在德国统一问题委员会记者招待会上说
    禁止德共是违背民族根本利益的
    新华社柏林1日电　德国统一问题委员会8月31日就德国共产党被禁止一事在柏林举行了记者招待会。
    在西德审讯共产党案中担任德国共产党辩护律师之一的弗·考尔博士在记者招待会上说：西德联邦宪法法院宣判禁止德国共产党是违反西德宪法的。
    考尔说：西德宣布禁止的德国共产党正是希特勒曾经迫害过的政党，这个政党曾经领导了反法西斯运动，遭受了无数牺牲。
    考尔指出，联邦宪法法院尽管在对德国共产党的判决书上承认：“为了德国的统一，德国共产党的合法存在是必要的”，但是，它仍然按照西德政府的意旨宣布了禁止德国共产党，这就证明，禁止德国共产党已经使德国的重新统一成为不可能，这是违背德国民族的根本利益的。
    考尔并且指出，西德几乎在实行普遍兵役法的同时宣布了禁止德国共产党，这不是偶然的。这明显地表明禁止德国共产党是对和平和欧洲安全的严重威胁。
    考尔呼吁西德人民要求西德联邦议院讨论取消对德国共产党的非法禁止的问题以消除对世界和平的威胁。
    德国共产党的另一位辩护律师克勒格在记者招待会上着重指出，西德联邦宪法法院的判决书没有能够举出德国共产党任何违反的事实和行为。它判决的根据仅仅因为德国共产党是一个马克思主义的政党。
