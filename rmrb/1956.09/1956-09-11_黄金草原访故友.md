    Visiting Old Friends on the Golden Prairie
    Our car sped across the plains of the Kostanay Oblast in northern Kazakhstan Republic at a speed of sixty kilometers per hour. The afterglow of the setting sun shone on this past wilderness, now a newly cultivated land, painting the boundless sea of wheat with a golden hue. Just as we discovered the myriad lights flashing ahead, we had arrived at the Urnek State Farm we were to visit.
    On the steps in front of the two-story building, we met Comrade Pulyakhin, the farm director, and Comrade Shreychikov, the farm party secretary. As soon as they saw us, they rushed forward and shook our hands warmly.
     "We are reunited with old friends!" Comrade Shreychikov, the party secretary, said with a smile.
    This farm party secretary, who had received the delegation of Chinese journalists more than three months ago, led us into his simple office.
     "Now, let's talk about this year's harvest. This is the good news we want to tell you," Comrade Shreychikov continued. "This spring, the farm sowed more than 23,000 hectares of wheat. When your comrades came last time, the wheat was just over half a person tall. Now our farm has a bumper harvest. This kind of harvest is the first we have seen in ten years. At first, we estimated that it would be good to harvest ten to fifteen centners of wheat per hectare, so we planned to hand over only 1.3 million poods of grain to the state. The first day of harvesting broke our estimate: each hectare of land yielded twenty to twenty-five centners of wheat. The other day, the eighth harvesting team harvested thirty to thirty-six centners per hectare. The actual harvested amount greatly exceeded the original plan, and we had to reconvene to discuss increasing the amount to be handed over. By mid-August, we had handed over 2 million poods of wheat to the state, while in previous years we only harvested five or six centners per hectare, and a total of only 61,000 centners on the farm's 20,000 hectares of land, handing over very little grain to the state."
    When we visited the Urnek State Farm, we visited the homes of Latnikov and Konikova, the first young couple to get married on the new land.
     "Chinese comrades are old friends, please come into the small room and sit down!" they both said, while shaking our hands tightly and pulling us into the room. The two spacious rooms and their furnishings were no different from the homes I had seen in Moscow.
     "Chinese readers already know your names. How is your life?" we said, spreading the "People's Daily" of July 8th on the table.
    Latnikov and Konikova leaned over quietly, looking at the "People's Daily", asking us to read it to them in Russian, word for word.
     "Look at our little girl, this is proof of our good life." Konikova pointed to the photo on the bookshelf, a picture of a chubby-faced little girl with thick little hands and legs. Konikova said: "Her name is Ilena, and her grandmother took her to Moscow to spend the summer more than a month ago."
     "This year's bumper harvest means the country has more grain." Latnikov said thoughtfully: "Our lives are changing rapidly. When the Chinese comrades came last time, we could only say that our lives were okay, now we should say they are very good."
    Konikova sat next to Latnikov, nodding from time to time. She added: "When we first came here, there was nothing on the wasteland. We had nothing in our hands except a suitcase! Now you see, we can't even fit all the items we've recently added into ten suitcases!"
    The Urnek Farm had a bumper harvest this year, increasing its income by five million rubles. Each combine harvester operator can earn an average of six to seven thousand rubles per month, and the lives of the workers on the new land have changed greatly. Shreychikov told us: "It has only been three months since your comrades left here, and the farm's construction has undergone great changes. Back then, some things were still being planned, but now they have become reality. The village head garden has been completed, and the park has also been built. Tailor shops, photo studios, and barber shops have all opened in the village, and huge granaries have been built. Half of the new two-story dormitory has been completed. Fifteen new dormitories were built within the past month. When you come back in a year, this new city built on the wasteland will have changed again."
    Because the plane was scheduled to take off at the appointed time, we had to say goodbye to the farm early. We got up at five o'clock the next morning. Although it was dawn, the village was already bustling. People were already in their cars, hurrying to the fields. Mobile stores loaded with new goods had also been set up on trucks. The sound of tractors in the wheat fields was deafening. The entire farm seemed to have woken up early.
    Farm Director Comrade Pulyakhin led us to visit the grain storage station. At the grain storage station, six thousand tons of wheat were piled into "gold mountains". Happy young girls were busy beside the electric winches and loaders.
     "Now our farm has five such grain storage stations, and most of the wheat has been transported to the state granaries by whole trucks," Comrade Pulyakhin told us: "After the farm's harvest is completed, large-scale construction will be carried out. New clubs, tenth-grade schools, shops, and a large number of residences will all be built. We ask you to come back and take a look next year at this time, and the farm will have changed again. The land we cultivate will no longer be 23,000 hectares, but more than 30,000 hectares."　Dai Feng reporting from Moscow

    黄金草原访故友
    我们的汽车以每小时六十公里的速度奔驰在哈萨克共和国北部库斯坦奈州的原野上。落日的余辉照在这过去的荒原，现在的新垦地上，把无际的麦海涂上了一片金黄。等到我们刚刚发现前边闪出万盏灯火的时候，我们已经到了我们要访问的乌尔涅克国营农场了。
    在二层高的楼房的门前台阶上，我们遇到了农场场长普利亚兴同志和农场党委书记什雷奇科夫同志。他们一见到我们，就抢步前来，双手紧握住我们的手。
     “我们是故友重逢了！”党委书记什雷奇科夫笑着说。
    这位在三个多月之前接待过中国新闻工作者代表团的农场党委书记领着我们走进了他的简朴的办公室。
     “现在，我们就来谈谈今年的收获吧，这正是我们想告诉你们的喜讯。”什雷奇科夫同志接着说：“今年春天，农场播种二万三千多公顷的小麦。你们的同志上次来的时候，麦子刚长过半个人高。现在我们的农场已出现了大丰收。这样的丰收，是我们十年来第一次见到的。开头我们估计，每公顷收上十公担到十五公担麦子就算好的了，所以我们预定交给国家粮食只是一百三十万普特。收割的第一天就把我们的估计打破了：一公顷土地出麦二十公担到二十五公担。前两天第八收割工作队，每公顷收到三十公担到三十六公担。实际收割数量大大超过了原定计划，我们不得不重新开会讨论增加上交数量。八月中旬我们交给国家的小麦已有二百万普特，而往年我们每公顷只收五、六公担，在农场的二万多公顷土地上一共只收获六万一千公担，上交给国家的粮食很少。”
    我们在访问乌尔涅克国营农场的时候，曾经到过拉特尼可夫和柯尼可娃的家里，他们是这个农场在新地上第一对举行婚礼的年青夫妇。
     “中国同志是老朋友了，请到小房里来坐坐！”他们俩个一边说，一边紧握着我们的手把我们拉进了房间。两间宽大的房间，房里的各样摆设跟我在莫斯科见到的住家没有什么差别。
     “中国读者早都知道你们的名字了，你们的生活怎么样？”我们说着，将7月8日的“人民日报”铺在桌上。
    拉特尼可夫和柯尼可娃不约而同地悄悄地凑过头来，看着“人民日报”，要我们一个字不漏地用俄语念给他们听。
     “你们看看我们的小女孩，这就是我们美好生活的证明。”柯尼可娃指着放在书架上的那张照片给我们看，照片上是一个胖胖的脸，有着粗壮的小手和小腿的小女孩的像。柯尼可娃说：“她叫依莲娜，前一个多月外祖母接她到莫斯科过夏去了。”
     “今年丰收，国家有了更多的粮食。”拉特尼可夫若有所思地说：“我们的生活正在迅速改变。前次中国同志来的时候，我们的生活只能说还可以，现在应该说很好了。”
    柯尼可娃坐在拉特尼可夫身边不时地点着头。她补充说：“初来这里，荒地上是一无所有，我们的手里除了一只箱子也是什么也没有啊！现在你们看，近来我们所添置的用品就是十个箱子也装不完！”
    乌尔涅克农场今年大丰收，增加了五百万卢布的收入。每一个联合收割机手平均每月可得六、七千卢布，新地上工人们的生活已有了很大的变化。什雷奇科夫告诉我们说：“你们的同志离开这里不过三个月，农场建设已经起了很大的变化。那时候有的都正在计划，可是现在都变成现实了。村头花园已经建成，公园也已经建起。村里成衣店、照相馆、理发室都已开张，庞大的粮仓已经建好。二层楼的新宿舍已经建成一半。前一个月之内就建好了十五幢新宿舍。一年后你们再来的时候，这座在荒地上建起的新城又要变样了。”
    由于飞机要在预定的时间起飞，我们不得不提早向农场告别。第二天清晨五点钟，我们就起身了。虽然是黎明，但村里已热闹非凡。人们都已经坐上了汽车，急忙奔向田间。装在汽车上的流动商店也已放上新的货物。麦田里拖拉机声响成一片。整个的农场都好像已经早早醒来了。
    农场场长普利亚兴同志领我们参观屯麦站。屯麦站上是六千吨小麦堆成了一座座的“金山”。快乐的年青姑娘们正在电气卷扬机和装运机旁忙碌着。
     “现在我们农场还有五个这样的屯麦站，大部分的麦子已经整车整车运到国家粮仓去了。”普利亚兴同志告诉我们说：“农场收割完成后，将进行大规模地建设。新的俱乐部、十年级学校、商店、大批住宅都得动工修建。我们要求你们明年现在再来看看，那时农场的面貌又要变了。我们所耕种的土地不再是二万三千公顷，而是三万多公顷了。”　戴枫寄自莫斯科
