    The Ministry of Aquatic Products Holds Symposium of Department and Bureau Chiefs
    Determines Next Year's Production and Sales Plan, Vigorously Develops Mass Fishery

    (Our dispatch) The Ministry of Aquatic Products convened a symposium of the heads of aquatic product departments (bureaus) from thirteen provinces and cities from August 29th to September 8th. This symposium focused on discussing and formulating the planned targets for production, supply and sales, and capital construction investment for 1957. Through extensive discussion, a consensus was reached on some major issues in aquatic product work.

    The meeting believes that it is necessary to actively lead and develop mass fishery in the future, care for the hardships of fishermen, and further give play to the role of fishery cooperatives. Because the production volume of mass fishery accounts for more than 90% of the total aquatic product output, the potential strength is very large. At present, the lives of some fishermen are still very difficult, and marine fisheries are at the forefront of national defense. In order to ensure the safe production of fishermen at sea, it has been determined that 28% of capital construction investment in 1957 will be used for the construction of typhoon shelters, fishing ports, navigation marker lighthouses, and storm warning stations.

    Preliminary conclusions were also made on issues such as the position of aquatic product undertakings in the entire national economy, the relationship between state-owned fisheries and mass fisheries, and the direction of developing marine fisheries and freshwater fisheries.

    水产部召开厅局长座谈会
    确定明年产销计划大力发展群众渔业
    本报讯　水产部从8月29日到9月8日召开了十三个省、市的水产厅（局）长座谈会。这次座谈会集中讨论和拟定了1957年的生产、供销和基建投资的计划指标，并经过广泛的讨论，对水产工作的一些重大问题取得了一致的认识。
    会议认为今后必须积极领导和发展群众渔业，关心渔民的疾苦，进一步发挥渔业合作社的作用。因为群众渔业的生产量占全部水产品产量的90％以上，潜在力量很大。目前，部分渔民的生活还很困难，海洋渔业又处在国防前哨，为保障海上渔民安全生产，确定1957年将以28％的基建投资从事于避风塘、渔港、航标灯塔、暴风警报站的建设。
    关于水产事业在整个国民经济中的地位、国营渔业与群众渔业的关系、发展海洋渔业与淡水渔业的方向等问题都做了初步的结论。
