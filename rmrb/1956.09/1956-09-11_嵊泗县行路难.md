    The Difficulty of Traveling in Shengsi County
    Our Shengsi County, Zhejiang Province, is located on the coast, and the residents of the county are scattered on more than twenty large and small islands, making transportation very inconvenient in the past. Not long after liberation, the local people's government and the people jointly established a local transportation company. Later, it was operated by the Shengsi County Supply and Marketing Cooperative. At that time, there were two motorboats that regularly traveled between Shengshan, Huanglong, Sijiao in Shengsi County, and Shanghai. In March of last year, according to instructions from higher authorities, the transportation business operated by the Shengsi County Supply and Marketing Cooperative was handed over to the Ningbo Branch of the Zhejiang Provincial Shipping Company. After taking over, not only were the sailing schedules and routes changed, and passengers were crowded, but also the Huanglong and Shengshan stations in Shengsi County were abandoned and ignored, and they often only sailed between Shanghai, Sijiao, and Dinghai. Originally, there was a boat to Shengshan every three or four days, but now often half a month, or even a month or two, passes without a boat coming. Now, goods shipped from Shanghai to Shengshan and Huanglong often have to be transshipped via Sijiao, which not only increases the freight costs but also causes frequent stock shortages in the market. This affects the production and life of the local people and the supply of materials to the local troops stationed there. As for the difficulties of the passengers, it goes without saying.
    This issue has been raised as an important proposal at the CPC Shengsi County Party Congress and the Shengsi County People's Congress. However, until now, the relevant departments have not taken any action. The ribbonfish season in Shengshan is approaching quickly. At that time, fishermen from all over will come here to fish. If this problem is not resolved in a timely manner, it will not only affect the lives of the local military and civilians but also cause serious losses to fishery production. Therefore, we request that the relevant departments take this issue seriously and promptly take effective measures to strengthen shipping services in the Shengsi Islands.

    嵊泗县行路难
    我们浙江省嵊泗县位于海滨，全县居民散居在大小二十多个岛屿上，过去交通很不方便。解放后不久，当地人民政府和人民群众合办了一个地方性的交通运输公司。后来，改由嵊泗县供销合作社经营。当时，有两只机轮，经常往返嵊泗县的嵊山、黄龙、泗礁和上海之间。去年三月间，根据上级指示，嵊泗县供销合作社经营的交通业务，交给了浙江省轮船公司宁波分公司，接办后，不仅船期改变，航线改变，乘客拥挤，而且先后把嵊泗县的黄龙和嵊山两站丢掉不管，经常只在上海、泗礁、定海之间航行。嵊山本来三、四天就有一班船，现在常常半个多月，甚至一两个月也没有船来。现在，从上海运到嵊山、黄龙两地的货物，经常要经泗礁转运，不但增加了货物的运价，而且造成市场上常有很多货物脱销。这就影响了当地人民的生产和生活，影响了对当地驻军的物资供应。至于旅客们的困难，就更不用说了。
    这个问题，在中共嵊泗县党代表会上和嵊泗县人民代表大会上，都曾经当作重要的提案提出过。可是，直到现在，有关部门还没有什么动静。嵊山带鱼汛期很快就要到了。那时候，各地渔民都要到这里来捕鱼。如果这个问题得不到及时的解决，它不但会影响当地军民的生活，也会给渔业生产带来严重的损失。因此，我们要求有关部门严肃对待这一问题，从速采取有效措施，加强嵊泗列岛的航运工作。
