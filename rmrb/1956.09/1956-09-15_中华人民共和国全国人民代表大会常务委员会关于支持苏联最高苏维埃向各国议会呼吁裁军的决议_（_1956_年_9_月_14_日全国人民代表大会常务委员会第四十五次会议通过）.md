    Resolution of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China on Supporting the Appeal of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union to Parliaments of All Countries on Disarmament
    (Adopted at the 45th Meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on September 14, 1956)
    The Chinese people have always loved peace. In order to build a prosperous and happy motherland, we, like the people of all countries in the world, urgently need a lasting peaceful international environment. Therefore, we have consistently advocated that all countries in the world, especially the major powers, should stop expanding their armaments, reduce their armaments, and prohibit atomic and hydrogen weapons, and reach corresponding international agreements on this. Due to the obstruction of the United States, disarmament negotiations have not yet reached an agreement. The Soviet Union has proposed the initiative of each country independently reducing its armaments without waiting for an international disarmament agreement, which has opened a new path for breaking the deadlock on the disarmament issue. This Soviet initiative not only conforms to the interests of the Soviet people, but also conforms to the interests of the Chinese people and the people of all countries in the world. Therefore, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China fully supports the proposals put forward in the appeal to the parliaments of all countries on the issue of disarmament by the Supreme Soviet of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on July 16, 1956. It is also willing to point out that China has successively reduced its armed forces by more than 2.7 million people since 1951, and will continue to work in this direction in the future.
    We hope that the parliaments of all countries, representing the will of the people of all countries, will seriously consider the recommendations in the appeal of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union and take corresponding measures to make due contributions to promoting disarmament in all countries and strengthening the cause of international peace.

    中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会常务委员会关于支持苏联最高苏维埃向各国议会呼吁裁军的决议
    （1956年9月14日全国人民代表大会常务委员会第四十五次会议通过）
    中国人民一向爱好和平，为了建设繁荣幸福的祖国，同世界各国人民一样，迫切需要一个持久和平的国际环境。因此，我们一贯主张世界各国特别是大国应该停止扩充军备，裁减军备，禁止原子武器和氢武器，并且对此达成相应的国际协议。由于美国的阻挠，裁军的谈判迄未达成协议，苏联提出不必等待国际裁军协议各国就自行裁减军备的倡议，这为打开裁军问题的僵局开辟了一条新的途径。苏联这一倡议，不仅符合苏联人民的利益，而且符合中国人民和世界各国人民的利益。因此，中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会常务委员会完全支持1956年7月16日苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟最高苏维埃就裁军问题致各国议会的呼吁书中所提出的主张。并且愿意指出，中国从1951年以来已经陆续裁减了它的武装部队二百七十多万人，今后还将朝着这个方向继续努力。
    我们希望代表各国人民意志的各国议会郑重考虑苏联最高苏维埃会议呼吁书中的建议，并采取相应措施，为推动各国裁军和加强国际和平的事业作出应有的贡献。
