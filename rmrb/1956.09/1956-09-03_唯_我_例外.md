    The Only "Me" is the Exception
    Editor:
    The AnDong Municipal People's Committee issued notices to various municipal agencies and units on November 14th of last year and January 5th of this year regarding the "Provisional Measures for the Living Management of Municipal Agencies." In addition to stipulating some aspects of life, such as the use of vehicles and housing, the notice also stipulated quotas for office furniture allocation. It stipulated that only the mayor and deputy mayor, and cadres above the twelfth grade, could have a desk, a swivel chair, a set of sofas, etc. Bureau chiefs and cadres above the fourteenth grade could have a desk and a swivel chair, but no sofa. Deputy bureau chiefs and cadres below the fifteenth grade could only have a desk and a spring chair or wooden chair, etc. As a result, many units followed these regulations.
    However, what about the Municipal People's Committee itself? Not only did they not hand over what should have been handed over, but they also took what others handed over to "enrich" themselves. As a result, those who shouldn't have sofas got sofas, those who shouldn't have swivel chairs got swivel chairs, and those who shouldn't have desks got desks.
    We don't understand why the AnDong Municipal People's Committee doesn't abide by the rules it made itself?

### 唯“我”例外

    唯“我”例外编辑同志：
    安东市人民委员会在去年11月14日和今年1月5日，曾给市各机关单位发下了关于“市级机关各项生活管理暂行办法”的通知和修正通知。通知中除对一些生活方面如用车、用房等问题作了规定外，还规定了办公室家具配备限额。其中规定：只有正副市长及十二级以上干部才能有一张写字台、一把转椅、一套沙发等等，局长及十四级以上干部可以有一张写字台、一把转椅，没有沙发。副局长及十五级以下干部只能有一张办公桌、一把弹簧椅或木椅等。于是不少单位都遵照执行了。
    但是，市人民委员会自己怎样呢？不仅应该交出来的没有交出来，而且人家交上来的又拿来“充实”了他们自己，于是不该有沙发的有沙发了，不该有转椅的有转椅了，不该有写字台的有写字台了。
    我们不明白，为什么安东市人民委员会自己订出来的制度，自己却不遵守？　何兴凯
