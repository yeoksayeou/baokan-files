Xinhua News Agency Report: Shanghai's fragrance industry has extracted more than ten kinds of precious essential oils from plants such as pearl orchids, clove flowers, fragrant leaves, and lavender.

    An experimental farm in the suburbs of Shanghai has now transplanted more than 100 kinds of flowers and herbs that can be used to extract essential oils from domestic and foreign sources, and is carrying out breeding, selection, and extraction work.

    The essential oils extracted from pearl orchids, which are abundant in Fujian and Guangdong, and clove flowers from the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, have a rich fragrance as if released from a flower bush, far superior to mineral synthetic fragrances. These two essential oils have now been used in perfumes, face powders, and lipsticks produced in Shanghai. The fragrant leaf oil obtained from fragrant leaves transplanted from Africa has a rose-like fragrance that is pleasant. Essential oils are also made from the root of Litsea cubeba from Jiangsu and the root of nutgrass from Zhejiang. The former has a lemon scent, while the latter is as fragrant as sandalwood.

    Fragrances blended with essential oils are indispensable raw materials for the cosmetics, food and other industries. At present, Shanghai's fragrance industry is continuing to study the extraction of essential oils from other flowers and herbs.

    从鲜花香草中提炼香油
    据新华社讯　上海香料工业从珠江兰花、丁香花、香叶、熏衣草里，提炼出十多种名贵的香油。
    上海郊区的一个实验农场，目前已经从国内和国外移植了一百多种可以提炼香油的花草，并且进行着培育、选种和提炼的工作。
    从盛产于福建、广东的珠兰花和越南民主共和国的丁香花里提炼出来的香油，浓郁的香味如同花丛中放出的一样，远远胜过矿物合成香精。这两种香油，现在都已经应用在上海生产的香水、香粉和唇膏里了。从非洲移植来的香叶中取得的香叶油，味道像玫瑰花一样，芬芳宜人。用江苏的山苍子和浙江的香附子草根也制成了香油，前者带柠檬香味，后者和檀香木一样清香。
    用香油配成的香料，是化妆品、食品等工业不可缺少的原料。目前上海香料工业正在继续研究从其它的花草中提取香油。
