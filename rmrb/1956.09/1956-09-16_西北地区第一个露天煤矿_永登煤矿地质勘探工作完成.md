Northwest China's First Open-Pit Coal Mine
Yongdeng Coal Mine Geological Exploration Work Completed

According to the Gansu Daily, the geological exploration of the open-pit area of the Yongdeng Yaojie Coalfield in Gansu, the first open-pit coal mine in Northwest China, has been completed. On August 31, the geological exploration team submitted a geological report to the state, recording all the exploration results in the area, and preparations for development and design have begun.

The Yaojie mining area belongs to the Jurassic strata which is believed to contain coal reserves. In 1953, the Ministry of Geology sent surveyors to conduct a general geological survey of the coalfield here. Subsequently, Team 134 of the Northwest Coalfield Geological Exploration Bureau of the Ministry of Coal Industry began detailed and precise surveys of the coalfield. During the work, Soviet geological experts and design experts gave sincere guidance to our country's geological personnel. The experts believed that the coal seams here are thick, and the strata covering the upper part of the coal seams are thin, making them suitable for open-pit mining by stripping the strata. The geological personnel implemented the experts' suggestions and completed the new arrangement of mountain operations and drilling according to the design department's exploration requirements for open-pit mines. The final data obtained fully confirmed that the coal storage situation and geological structure of this area possess the conditions for open-pit mining.

Open-pit mining has high output, low investment, and is the most economical and safe mining method. According to the proven coal reserves, it is estimated that the annual production capacity of this mine after development and design will be more than two and a half times higher than the total annual output of all coal mines under the Gansu Mining Bureau. Not long ago, mine designers observed the geological conditions on the spot, checked the geological data, and began preparing for development and design.

    西北地区第一个露天煤矿
    永登煤矿地质勘探工作完成
    据甘肃日报讯　西北地区第一个露天煤矿——甘肃永登窑街煤田露天区的地质勘探工作，已经完成。8月31日，地质勘探人员向国家提交了记载着这个地区的全部勘探成果的地质报告书，开发设计的准备工作已开始进行。
    窑街矿区是属于有储煤希望的株罗纪地层。1953年，地质部就派出勘测人员在这里进行了煤田地质的普查工作。接着，煤炭工业部西北煤田地质勘探局一三四队开始进行了煤田详查和精查工作。在工作过程中，苏联地质专家和设计专家给了我国地质人员以真诚的指导。专家认为这里的煤层厚，复盖在煤层上部的地层薄，适于剥离地层而露天开采。地质人员贯彻了专家建议，并根据设计部门对露天矿井的勘探要求，完成了新布置的山地作业和钻探。最后获得的资料，完全证实这个地区煤的储存情况和地质构造具备了露天开采的条件。
    露天采煤的产量大，投资少，是最经济和安全的采煤方法。根据探明的煤藏量计算，预计这个矿开发设计的年产能力，比目前甘肃矿务局所属各煤矿的总年产量还要高两倍半多。不久前，矿井设计师们曾实地观察了地质情况，校对了地质资料，开始进行开发设计的准备工作。
