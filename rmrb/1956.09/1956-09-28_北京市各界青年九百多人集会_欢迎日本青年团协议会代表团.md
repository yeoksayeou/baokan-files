Xinhua News Agency, September 27th: More than 900 youths from all walks of life in Beijing gathered tonight to welcome the delegation from the Japan Youth Organization Council.

    After the meeting began, Liu Xiyuan, Vice Chairman of the All-China Youth Federation and Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, delivered a speech. He said: The people and youth of China and Japan have always had a traditional friendship. This visit to our country by the delegation of the Japan Youth Organization Council marks a new development in the friendship between the youth of the two countries. Japan is the first country to suffer the disaster of atomic bombs, and the Chinese people and youth have also tasted the pain of war from long-term wars. We deeply realize what war will bring to our youth if it occurs. Therefore, we are all firmly opposed to war and demand peace. Peace and friendship have become the common aspiration of the youth and people of our two countries. The Chinese youth express their admiration and deep concern for the contributions made by the Japanese youth in the struggle against the aggression of US imperialism, for national independence and territorial sovereignty, and for the maintenance of world peace.

    In the end, on behalf of the Chinese youth, he told Japanese youth friends that they would always receive the sympathy and support of the Chinese youth in their just struggle.

    In his reply, delegation leader Yoshiaki Sagae expressed his firm belief that the people of China and Japan would always be friendly with each other. No matter what happens in the future, the Japanese people and youth will never take up guns to wage war again. He said: "The purpose of our visit to your country this time is to establish a solid and lasting friendship. The reason why we have this desire is because the Japanese youth, the first on earth to suffer from the scourge of atomic bombs, sincerely desire peace. Without friendly relations between China and Japan, lasting peace in Asia is unimaginable. In the short few days that we have been in China, we have seen that the Chinese youth and the entire Chinese people, like us, sincerely desire peace. Therefore, we firmly believe that China and Japan will always be friendly with each other." Finally, he suggested that all members of the delegation sing a Japanese song "Tokyo - Beijing". At this time, the whole audience stood up, and the youth of the two countries sang this song expressing the friendship between China and Japan in different languages.

    Gifts were also presented to each other at the meeting, and Peking Opera was performed after the meeting.

    北京市各界青年九百多人集会
    欢迎日本青年团协议会代表团
    据新华社27日讯　北京市各界青年九百多人今天晚上集会欢迎日本青年团协议会代表团。
    大会开始后，中华全国民主青年联合会副主席、中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会书记处书记刘西元致词。他说：中日两国人民和青年一直有着传统的友谊。这次日本青年团协议会代表团来我国访问标志着两国青年友谊的新的发展。日本是第一个遭受原子弹灾难的国家，中国人民和青年也从长期的战争中饱尝了战争的痛苦，我们都深切地体会到如果发生战争会给我们青年带来什么。因此我们都坚决反对战争，要求和平。和平友好已经成为我们两国青年和人民的共同愿望。中国青年对日本青年在反对美帝国主义的侵略、争取民族独立和领土主权以及维护世界和平的斗争中所作的贡献，表示十分钦佩和深切关怀。
    他最后代表中国青年向日本青年朋友表示，在他们的正义斗争中，随时都会得到中国青年的同情和支持。
    代表团团长寒河江善秋在致答词时表示，他坚信中日两国人民是会永远友好相处的。今后无论发生什么事情，日本人民和青年决不会再拿起枪来进行战争。他说：“我们这次来你们国家访问的目的，是要建立一种巩固而持久的友谊。我们所以有这种愿望是因为在地球上第一个遭受原子弹祸害的日本青年是衷心地要求和平的。如果没有中日两国之间的友好关系，那么亚洲的持久和平是不可想像的。我们来到中国的短短几天中就看到中国青年和全中国人民都和我们一样衷心地要求和平。因此我们坚信中日两国是会永远友好相处的。”最后他建议代表团全体团员唱一支日本歌“东京——北京”，这时全场起立，两国青年用不同的语言歌唱了这支表示中日两国友谊的歌曲。
    会上还互相赠送礼品，会后演出了京剧。
