Comrade Zhang Yun, First Secretary of the Hainan District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party of Guangdong Province, Speaks:

    Hainan Island is a good place with significant economic value and the potential to greatly develop special economic crops. Actively developing this area can provide the nation with a large amount of important industrial raw materials and export goods.
    I fully agree with the reports made by Comrades Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, and Deng Xiaoping on behalf of the Central Committee. I would now like to offer some opinions on the development of agricultural resources on Hainan Island.
    Hainan Island has relatively abundant rainfall and fertile soil, and its climate is tropical and subtropical. This is a good place with significant economic value and the potential to greatly develop special economic crops. In this area, it is possible to grow rubber, coffee, coconuts, quinine, and sisal hemp needed for navigation, as well as oil palm that can produce high-quality mechanical lubricating oil, all of which are difficult to grow in most parts of our country. Although some of these crops are not yet widely planted, after several years of trial planting since liberation, most of the aforementioned crops can be developed on a large scale and achieve high yields. Therefore, as long as this area is actively developed, the country can obtain a large amount of important industrial raw materials and export goods. In addition, Hainan Island also produces many valuable tree species and forestry by-products.
    However, Hainan Island is still in an undeveloped state. The entire island has more than 21 million mu of wasteland and more than 5.8 million mu of barren mountains, of which 12 million mu are suitable for planting economic crops. The existing farmland on the island is mainly used for growing rice and miscellaneous grains, with very low and unstable yields. Therefore, the lives of the broad masses of people remain very difficult. In order to gradually improve the material and cultural life of the working people, it is also necessary to develop economic crops in a planned way.
    According to the instructions of the Central Committee and the Provincial Party Committee, we have conducted systematic surveys of Hainan's agricultural resources and carried out development planning. In the future, we will more actively and systematically carry out development work on a larger scale on the current basis. According to the plan, by next year, the planting area of tropical economic crops will be more than 1.7 million mu, and another 4 million mu will be added during the second five-year plan period, and will increase to 12 million mu during the third five-year plan period.
    Everyone agrees on developing Hainan Island's agricultural resources. However, the question remains as to the timing of the development, that is, whether large-scale development should be done later or earlier. In our opinion, it is better to develop it sooner. Because many special economic crops are perennial plants. For example, rubber trees take eight years to start producing rubber, while coffee, oil palm, and sisal hemp take six years to reach full production. It is very clear that delaying development by one year will cause a significant delay. Therefore, we request the Central Committee to include large-scale development of Hainan Island's agricultural resources in the Second Five-Year Plan.
    In order to develop Hainan Island's agricultural resources on a large scale and comprehensively, it is necessary to carry out some necessary basic construction work. However, relying solely on the strength of Guangdong and Hainan Island itself is not enough in any case. This requires strong support from the Central Committee.
    According to the current situation, the most important thing to do is to build water conservancy projects to overcome drought disasters. There are good conditions for building water conservancy projects on Hainan Island. There are 157 rivers in the entire region, of which 5 have a water collection area of more than 1,000 square kilometers. Moreover, as mentioned earlier, the rainfall in this area is also abundant. Therefore, if large-scale water storage projects can be built, the water demand can be completely solved. We request that the Songtao, Jiaxingling, and Guangba reservoirs be built gradually during the three five-year plan periods, and especially request the Central Committee to complete the Songtao Reservoir at least during the second five-year plan period. After the completion of this reservoir, it can irrigate 2.92 million mu of tropical economic crops, generate about 40,000 kilowatts of electricity, and further develop the shipping conditions of the Nandu River. In addition, the lack of labor on Hainan Island is also a major difficulty. Currently, there are a total of 1.3 million laborers in the region, and each laborer has to cultivate five mu of land and is required to basically achieve "three harvests" a year. Therefore, it is already difficult to implement intensive farming on the existing cultivated land. If a large amount of wasteland is reclaimed, the difficulty of labor shortage will be even greater. The solution to this problem is to immigrate a large number of people. We hope to immigrate about 100,000 people during the three five-year plan periods. Second, we request the country to support agricultural machinery. The area suitable for mechanized farming on Hainan Island is more than 6 million mu. Calculated at 3,000 mu per standard tractor, 664 units need to be solved during the second five-year plan period. Finally, in order to drive and stimulate the rapid development of Hainan's tropical economic crops and other crops, and to increase industrial products and accumulate funds for the country, it is also necessary to build some large-scale factories accordingly. We request the Central Committee to build one or two sugar factories with a capacity of 3,000 to 5,000 tons during the second five-year plan period. As for the funds and technical strength required for the development of Hainan, we also hope that the Central Committee will solve them together.

    开发海南岛的农业资源
    中共广东省海南区委员会第一书记　张云同志的发言
    海南岛是一个有重大经济价值的、可以大量发展特种经济作物的好地方。积极开发这个地区，国家可以获得大量重要工业原料和出口物资。
    我完全同意刘少奇同志、周恩来同志和邓小平同志代表中央委员会所作的报告。我现在只就开发海南岛的农业资源问题发表一些意见。
    海南岛雨量比较充足，土壤比较肥沃，它的气候属于热带和亚热带。这是一个有重大经济价值的、可以大量发展特种经济作物的好地方。在这个地方，可以种植在我国大部地区不容易生长的橡胶、咖啡、椰子、金鸡纳霜，以及航海所需用的剑麻、能制质量很好的机械润滑油的油棕等。虽然，有些作物在目前种植的还不多。但经过解放后几年的试种，上述作物除少数外，都可以大量发展，而且可以达到很高的产量。因此，只要积极地把这个地区开发出来，国家就可以获得很大数量的重要工业原料和出口物资。另外，在海南岛还生产不少的贵重树种和林业副产品。
    但是现在海南岛还处在未开发的状态，全岛还有荒地两千一百多万亩，荒山五百八十多万亩，这些荒地荒山中有一千二百万亩适宜种植经济作物。全岛已有的农田，主要种植水稻和杂粮，产量很低，而且极不稳定，因此广大人民群众的生活仍然很苦。为了逐步改善劳动人民的物质和文化生活，也必须有计划地发展经济作物。
    根据中央和省委的指示，我们已经对海南农业资源作了系统的勘察，并且进行了开发的规划工作。今后我们将在现在的基础上更加积极地有计划地大力进行开发工作。按照计划，到明年，热带经济作物种植面积将为一百七十多万亩，第二个五年计划期内，将再增加四百万亩，第三个五年计划时期内，将增加到一千二百万亩。
    开发海南岛的农业资源，这是大家都同意的。不过问题还在于开发的时间，也就是大规模开发，迟些好，还是早些好。根据我们的看法，是早些开发的好。因为，很多特种经济作物，都是多年生的植物，比如，橡胶要八年才能开始割胶，咖啡、油棕、剑麻等要六年才能盛产。非常明显地看出，迟开发一年，耽误是很大的。因此，我们要求中央把大规模开发海南岛农业资源，列入第二个五年计划。
    为了大规模地全面地开发海南岛农业资源，就必须进行一些必要的基本建设工作。但是仅仅靠广东和海南岛本地区的力量，无论如何是不够的。这就需要中央大力予以支援。
    按照当前的情况来说，应该举办的最重要的是兴修水利，以战胜干旱灾害。在海南岛修水利是有很好的条件的。全区河流有一五七条，其中积水面积在一、○○○平方公里以上的就有五条，并且，如前面所说，这个地区的雨量也很充足。因此，如能兴建较大的储水工程，完全可以解决用水需要。我们要求在三个五年计划期间逐步把松涛、加兴岭和广坝水库建好，特别要求中央在第二个五年计划期内，至少把松涛水库建成。这个水库建成后，可灌溉热带经济作物二九二万亩，发电约四万瓩，还可进一步发展南渡江的航运状况。另外，海南岛劳动力缺乏也是一个主要困难。现在全区共有一三○万劳动力，每个劳动力要耕种五亩田，还要求基本做到一年“三熟”，因此，对现有的耕地已经很难实行精耕细作，如果再进行大量开荒，劳动力不足的困难就更大了。解决这一问题的办法，一是大量移民，我们希望在三个五年计划内移民约一○万人。二是要求国家支援农业机械，海南岛适宜机耕的面积有六百多万亩，以一标准台拖拉机耕三、○○○亩计算，第二个五年计划期内需要解决六六四台。最后，为了带动和刺激海南热带经济作物和其他农作物的迅速发展，为了替国家增产工业品和积累资金，还须相应地兴建一些大型工厂。我们要求中央在第二个五年计划期内兴建一处两处三、○○○吨至五、○○○吨的糖厂。至于开发海南所需的资金和技术力量也望中央一并解决。
