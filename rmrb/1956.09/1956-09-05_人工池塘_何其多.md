How Many "Artificial Ponds" Are There?
Xu Peixiao

In recent years, factories under the First Ministry of Machine Building have built many basements. Most of these basements have defects in terms of engineering quality; in particular, water leakage is very serious.

Taking the basements built in the First Automobile Works dormitory area in 1954 as an example, since 1955, more than 60% of the basement projects have been found to be leaking water, but no effective measures have been taken to remedy them so far. People call these basements "artificial ponds," and often say helplessly: "We spent money to build a batch of sanatoriums exclusively for yellow croaker!"

Even more unfortunately, the construction department of the Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant did not learn from the lessons of the First Automobile Works in this year's construction process, and still built seven basements into "artificial ponds." The indoor water accumulation in these basements is generally 30 to 70 centimeters deep. Some have cracked bottom plates, some have bottom plates bulging 30 centimeters, and the reserved joints of the asphalt felt have all been broken, and they cannot play a waterproof role at all.

It is conceivable what the consequences of basement water leakage will be for wooden doors and windows and sanitary equipment that are soaked in water all day long, not to mention the electrical wires, lamps, and switches that are particularly afraid of moisture. What is particularly serious is that water often corrodes the walls and foundations. How can the safety of the entire building be guaranteed over time?

Generally speaking, the reasons for basement water leakage are nothing more than the following: First, the hydrological and geological data used by the design unit when designing the basement are inaccurate, and the waterproof and moisture-proof measures adopted are unreliable; second, the construction unit simply rushes to complete tasks and speed up progress. Waterproof sheds are not set up during rainy season construction, drainage ditches are not dug, and the construction of waterproof projects is too sloppy; third, the construction unit does not pay close attention to design review and construction supervision, and the control is not strict, so the basement is prone to water leakage.

In fact, the more important reason lies in the ideological aspect, in the general lack of attention to basement projects by basic construction departments. A person in charge of a construction unit once publicly declared at a meeting between Party A and Party B that their engineering company did not guarantee that the basements they contracted to build would not leak. Although some comrades did not speak so bluntly, they believed: "Basement projects do not involve a large amount of work, and they are hidden projects, so it doesn't matter if they are a little sloppy," and "It is important to ensure the quality of the upper-level projects. It doesn't matter if the quality of the basement projects is a little poor, because people can't see it." It is these views that have caused problems with many basement projects.

This year is already the fourth year of the first five-year plan. The construction department can no longer use "lack of experience" as a shield, and can no longer blame all the reasons for basement water leakage on objective conditions. It is hoped that all construction departments will actively take measures to eliminate this "artificial pond" and "yellow croaker sanatorium" from now on!

### “人工池塘”何其多

    “人工池塘”何其多
    徐培孝
    第一机械工业部所属各厂，这几年陆续修建了不少地下室。这些地下室在工程质量方面，多数都存在着缺点；特别是漏水现象十分严重。
    以1954年第一汽车制造厂宿舍区修建的地下室为例，从1955年起，就发现60％以上的地下室工程漏水，但是至今还没有采取有效措施加以补救。人们都把这些地下室叫做“人工池塘”，常常无可奈何地说：“我们花钱修了一批专供黄花鱼用的疗养所！”
    更可惜的是，武汉重型机床厂的施工部门，在今年的施工过程中还没有吸取第一汽车制造厂的教训，依旧把七个地下室修成了“人工池塘”。这些地下室一般室内积水深达三十到七十公分，有的底板断裂，有的底板鼓起三十公分，油毛毡预留接头处已经全部破烂，根本起不了防水作用。
    地下室漏水，对于整天泡在水里的木门窗、卫生设备将产生怎样的结果，是可以想见的，当然更不用说那些分外怕潮的电线、灯具、开关了。特别严重的是，水经常侵蚀着墙和基础，日子一久，整个建筑物的安全怎么能保证呢？
    通常谈论地下室漏水的原因，不外以下几个方面：首先，是设计单位在设计地下室的时候，依据的水文地质资料不准确，采用的防水、防潮措施不可靠；其次，是施工单位单纯赶任务、抢进度，雨季施工也不搭防水棚，不挖排水沟，对防水工程的施工过分马虎；再次，是建设单位对设计审核、施工监督抓得不紧，掌握不严，结果地下室就很容易漏水了。
    其实，更重要的原因还在于思想方面，在于基本建设部门普遍不重视地下室工程。有一个施工单位的负责人，曾经在一次甲乙方会议上公开宣称，他们工程公司所承包修建的地下室，不担保不漏。有些同志虽然没有谈得这么露骨，但是他们认为：“地下室工程量不大，又是隐蔽工程，无妨马虎一点”，“搞好上层工程的质量要紧，地下室工程质量差一点，人们也看不见”。正是这些看法作怪，才使许多地下室工程出了问题。
    今年已经是执行第一个五年计划的第四个年头，施工部门已经不能再把“没有经验”作挡箭牌，不能再把地下室漏水的原因一股脑儿都推到客观条件上去了。希望各施工部门积极采取措施，让这种“人工池塘”、“黄花鱼疗养所”从此绝迹！
