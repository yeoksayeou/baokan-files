Comrade Zhang Kaifan, Secretary of the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party's Speech

The National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) proposes that "starting from 1956, according to local conditions, the unemployment problem in cities should be resolved within five or seven years." The Proposal (Draft) of the Eighth National Congress of the Party on the Second Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy also proposes to rationally arrange labor and gradually eliminate unemployment. I think these requirements are timely and completely achievable for Anhui.

The auxiliary labor force in petty trader families urgently needs arrangement

In the spring of this year, in conjunction with the arrangement and transformation of private industrial and commercial enterprises, we conducted a general survey of unemployed people in cities. According to statistics from 74 cities across the province, there were 93,183 unemployed people. After screening, 30,377 housewives belonged to the category of social relief recipients rather than the unemployed, and 9,755 people were completely unable to work. The actual number of unemployed people was 53,051, accounting for 2.6% of the urban population. The number is not very large. As of the end of July this year, we have arranged 46,166 people through adjusting commercial networks and organizing agricultural, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline production. With the development of industrial and agricultural production and cultural undertakings, the real unemployment phenomenon is relatively easy to eliminate. What is more difficult to solve is the arrangement of auxiliary labor in petty trader families, that is, the arrangement of the above-mentioned 30,000+ housewives.

This problem became more prominent during the comprehensive transformation of private industry and commerce. Although petty traders and peddlers have basically realized cooperation, acting as sales agents for state-owned commercial cooperatives, and have formed cooperative groups that operate independently and are responsible for their own profits and losses, their limited income still cannot solve the excessive family burden. It is reasonable for them to urgently request appropriate arrangements for their family's auxiliary labor.

Developing family sideline production is a good way

In solving this problem, we once envisioned two methods: One method was to insert the family's auxiliary labor into cooperative enterprises. This would inevitably increase the expenses of cooperative enterprises and affect the operation of the entire enterprise. The other method was to develop a variety of family sideline production in light of local conditions to solve the problem of auxiliary labor. Based on the results of our pilot program in Hefei, the latter method is a positive way to solve the problem with less money and greater results.

A total of 7,214 people in Hefei City applied for registration and requested arrangements for family auxiliary labor, including 916 men and 6,298 women. In order to gradually arrange these auxiliary laborers, we have developed twelve kinds of family sideline occupations in Hefei City, such as hemp rope, white material (a raw material needed by grinding wheel factories), embroidery, weaving, sewing, cloth shoes, chicken feather dusters, mousetraps, mops, scrub brushes, children's clothing, and toys. 720 people have participated in production, with a minimum monthly income of five yuan, generally around fifteen yuan, and a maximum of thirty yuan. This has played a good role in supplementing family life. We believe that this method, in addition to solving the problem of auxiliary labor, increasing people's income, and facilitating the transformation of petty traders and peddlers, also has the following benefits: ① Local processing and local use can save transportation and reduce costs. For example, the hemp rope needed by the city throughout the year will no longer need to be transported from other places in the future; ② Factory waste and scraps can be fully utilized. For example, scraps from enamel, knitting, and garment factories are the best raw materials for manufacturing toys, children's clothing, and cloth shoes. In the past, most of these scraps were wasted; ③ Many products that are inconvenient for the state to produce can be produced, such as chicken feather dusters and mousetraps, to meet the needs of the people. However, there are problems in the process of developing family sideline production. Based on Hefei's experience, the following issues must be resolved first:

Four Experiences

First, the issue of management ideology must be resolved. At the beginning, some comrades were greedy for high and large, looked down on small things, and attempted to turn some sideline occupations that could only be produced in a decentralized manner into factories. As a result, this not only required more government investment and fostered the masses' dependence, but also this approach was not suitable for arranging auxiliary labor. We criticized this thinking and emphasized the principle of adapting to local conditions and decentralized operation, which made the smooth development of family sideline production possible.

Second, the technical problem must be solved. The solution to this problem is: first, recruit masters to run technical training classes; second, send cadres to study in various places and come back to teach. Because we tried to find ways from many aspects, the problem was quickly solved.

Third, the problem of raw material supply must be solved. Our solution to this problem is mainly to take materials locally, the state supplies raw materials, and the finished products are regularly recovered, and part of it is produced and sold by the masses themselves. Because these sideline productions all follow the principle of adapting to local conditions, the sales are not a problem except for the need to supply raw materials.

Fourth, leadership must be strengthened, and there must be a special agency to plan and guide this work. Other relevant departments, especially women's federations, must give strong cooperation to this work.

Now we have promoted the effective methods in Hefei to the whole province. The number of people participating in this production is constantly increasing. We estimate that after another two or three years, these auxiliary laborers can be arranged well, and good results will be achieved.

### 妥善安排小商贩家庭的辅助劳动力

    妥善安排小商贩家庭的辅助劳动力
    中共安徽省委员会书记　张恺帆同志的发言
    全国农业发展纲要（草案）提出“从一九五六年开始，按照各地情况，分别在五年或者七年内，解决城市中的失业问题”。这次党的第八次代表大会关于发展国民经济的第二个五年计划的建议（草案）又提出合理安排劳动力，逐步地消除失业现象。我认为这些要求的提出是适时的，对于安徽来说也是完全可以实现的。
    小商贩家庭的辅助劳动力迫切要求安排
    在今年春季，我们结合私营工商业的安排改造，对城市失业人员进行了一次普查，根据全省七十四个城市的统计，共有失业人员九万三千一百八十三人，经过甄别，其中不属于失业范围而属于社会救济对象的家庭妇女为三万零三百七十七人，完全丧失劳动者九千七百五十五人。真正的失业人员为五万三千零五十一人，占城市人口百分之二点六。数量并不是很多的，截至今年七月底，我们已从调整商业网和组织农林牧副业生产等方面安排了四万六千一百六十六人。随着工农业生产和文化事业的发展，真正的失业现象是比较容易消除的，而比较困难解决的是小商小贩家庭辅助劳动力，亦即上述三万多家庭妇女的安排问题。
    这个问题，在私营工商业进入全面改造中表现更为突出。虽然小商小贩基本上已实现了合作化，为国营商业合作社商业执行代销代购业务，并且已组成分散经营各负盈亏的合作小组，但是因为收入有限，仍然解决不了过重的家庭负担。他们迫切要求对其家庭辅助劳动给予适当的安排，应当说是合理的。
    发展家庭副业生产是一种好办法
    在解决这个问题时，我们曾经设想两种办法：一种办法是把家庭的辅助劳动力插进合作企业。如此，势必增加合作企业的开支，影响整个企业的经营。另一种办法是因地制宜地发展多种多样的家庭副业生产，来解决辅助劳动力的出路问题。就我们在合肥试行的结果，证明后一种办法是化钱少、收效大，最能解决问题的一种积极的办法。
    合肥市申请登记要求安排的家庭辅助劳动力共七千二百一十四人，其中男的九百一十六人，女的六千二百九十八人。为了逐步安排这些辅助劳动力，我们已在合肥市发展了麻绳、白料（砂轮厂需要的一种原料）、刺绣、编织、缝纫、布鞋、鸡毛帚、捕鼠器、拖把、板刷、儿童服装、玩具等十二种家庭副业，参加生产的已有七百二十人，每月收入最少的有五元，一般的在十五元左右，多的达三十元。这对于家庭生活补助已起了良好作用。我们认为这种办法，除了解决辅助劳动的出路，增加人民收入，有利于小商小贩的改造外，还有以下一些好处：①当地加工当地用，可以节约运输、降低成本，如该市全年需要的麻绳，今后就可以不要从外地运入了；②工厂的废料下脚料可以得到充分的利用，如搪瓷、针织，被服厂的零头碎料就是制造玩具、童装、布鞋的最好原料。过去这些碎料大部分是浪费了的；③可以生产许多国家所不便生产的产品，如鸡毛帚、捕鼠器等，满足了人民的需要。但是在发展家庭副业生产的过程中不是没有问题的。根据合肥的经验，必须首先解决如下几个问题：
    四条经验
    第一，必须解决经营思想问题。在开始时，有些同志贪高求大，看不起小的，把一些只能是分散生产的副业企图办成工厂，结果不仅需要政府更多的投资和助长了群众的依赖思想，而且这种作法并不适合于辅助劳动力的安排。我们批判了这种思想，强调了因地制宜、分散经营的方针，因而使家庭副业生产有了顺利发展的可能。
    第二，必须解决技术问题。解决这个问题的办法：一是招聘师傅开办技术训练班；一是派出干部到各地留学，回来传授。因为是从多方面设法，所以就很快的解决了问题。
    第三，必须解决原料供应问题。我们解决这个问题的办法，主要是就地取材，由国家供给原料，定期收回成品，部分是由群众自产自销。因为这些副业生产都是执行因地制宜的方针，所以除需要供应原料以外，销路是不成问题的。
    第四，必须加强领导，要有专门机构，规划与指导这一工作。其他有关部门特别是妇联组织对于这项工作要给予有力的配合。
    现在我们已将在合肥行之有效的办法，在全省加以推广。参加这种生产的人员正在不断增加，我们估计再经过二、三年之后，这些辅助劳动力是可以安排好的，是会收到良好效果的。
