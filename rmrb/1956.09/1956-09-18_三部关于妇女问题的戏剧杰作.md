Three Dramatic Masterpieces on Women's Issues
Li Jianwu

The grievances between men and women are merely the inevitable product of unequal social status. Ancient Greek tragedians used a romantic legend to illustrate this fact, often seen in the old society. With the power to move mountains and overturn seas, he placed an abandoned woman in a hopeless situation, and then showed the audience the shocking consequences. He brought the contradiction to its peak, forming a huge tragic situation. Ibsen used everyday life, with the most solid structure and the most wonderful technique, to gradually bring the problem before Nora (a lovely and muddled young woman) to test her, and through her test, to test her husband Helmer: the play began filled with the joyful mood of celebrating the festival, until the third act, the dance was still being held upstairs, and only before her final departure did Nora take off her dancing dress! Just as Helmer kept calling her "little bird," but actually had a head full of selfish notions of honor, the play on the surface had the atmosphere of celebrating the festival. The playwright found the most serious dramatic theme in the most ordinary life.

One play is a tragedy, one is a comedy, and Molière, in 1662, used the same theme to write another comedy. The first two plays took the "wife" as the central figure. In Molière's "The School for Wives," the man who wants to marry the "wife" becomes the central figure. He is a wealthy merchant who bought a four-year-old girl and sent her to a remote convent, because he said it well: "I want her to know nothing. To be honest with you, it's enough for her to know how to pray to God, love me, sew and spin." Such a "wife" is actually enough for him. He is a male-chauvinist, he taught his seventeen-year-old fiancée: "The great power is on the side of the beard. Although society is half male and half female, half does not equal equality: one half is high above, one half is low below; one half manages, one half obeys orders; just like soldiers abide by discipline, obey superiors, servants obey masters, children obey fathers, the lowest-ranking novices obey the abbot, they are still not as good as wives serving their husbands, who should be gentle, obedient, humble, and respectful, because the husband is her superior, her lord, and her master." Molière reduced the man who said and believed such words to a "buffoon" in the play. He had the feudal system and wealth as his backing, he had all the advantages, and the playwright even seemed to give him the benefit of comedic techniques: the girl and boy, without understanding, took turns reporting their love affairs to him. But he failed, because the girl finally woke up, not only secretly doing things, but also openly arguing with him.

"I brought you up from childhood, doesn't that count for anything?"

"You've really worked hard on this, and the education I've received in all aspects is really beautiful! Do you think I'm really smug and can't see that I'm a fool? Thinking about this makes me blush; if I had the ability, at my age, I would never want to be seen as a fool."

Before she became a "virtuous wife and good mother," she exposed the man's selfish intentions. This is the first modern drama to directly raise social issues, especially women's issues. Ibsen inherited this militant tradition of sharply criticizing patriarchal ideas, but put aside the special character of comedy, and used a strict life form to write an intimate and touching play—a modern dramatic genre.

Today, such social problems are approaching resolution. Democratic countries have enshrined gender equality in their constitutions. Women's rights have clear guarantees. If the three playwrights were still alive, I believe they would welcome the revolutionary and brilliant actions of democratic countries with a victorious mood. (End)

    三部关于妇女问题的戏剧杰作
    李健吾
    男女之间的冤仇，只是社会地位不平等的必然产物。古希腊悲剧家用一个浪漫传说，说明了这个在旧社会经常见到的事实。他以移山倒海的力量，把一个弃妇放在无路可走的境地，然后再把惊心动魄的恶果给观众看。他把矛盾带到最高峰，形成绝大的悲剧形势。易卜生用的是日常生活，以最坚定的结构和最美妙的手法，逐步把问题提到娜拉（一个可爱的糊涂少妇）面前来考验她，通过她受到的考验，又来考验她的丈夫海尔茂：戏在开始充满了欢度佳节的愉快情绪，直到第三幕，楼上还在举行舞会，而在最后出走之前，娜拉方才脱下她的跳舞衣服！就像海尔茂口口声声叫她“小鸟”，实际却一脑门子自私的荣誉观念一样，戏在表面上是欢度佳节的气氛。剧作家在最日常的生活中找到最严肃的戏剧主题。
    一出是悲剧，一出是正剧，而莫里哀在1662年，用同一主题，又写成喜剧。前两出戏拿“妻”做中心人物。到了莫里哀的“夫人学堂”里面，想娶“妻”的男子成了中心人物。他是一个阔商人，买了一个四岁小姑娘，送到偏僻的小修道院，因为他说的好：“我要她一无所知。对你实说了罢，懂得祷告上帝，爱我，缝缝纺纺，在她也就够了。”这样的“妻”，其实只是在他也就够了。他是一个男权中心论者，他这样教训他的十七岁的未婚妻：“大权都在胡子这面。社会虽然男女各半，可是各半不就等于两下相等：一半高高在上，一半低低在下；一半管理，一半但凭吩咐；好比兵士遵守纪律，服从上级长官，听差服从主人，孩子服从父亲，品级最低的小修士服从道长，都还跟不上太太伺候丈夫那样应当柔和、依顺、低声下气、必恭必敬，因为丈夫就是她的长官、她的领主和她的主人。”说这种话也信这种话的男子，莫里哀把他贬成戏里的“滑稽人”。他有封建制度和钱财做他的后盾，他有一切优势，剧作者连喜剧技巧似乎也送给他受用：女孩子和男孩子不懂事，轮流向他报告他们的恋爱经过。但是他失败了，因为女孩子终于觉醒了，不但暗里做，而且明目张胆和他斗嘴。
    “把你从小带大，好说不算什么？”
    “你在这上头，可真辛苦啦，我各方面受的教育，也真漂亮啦！你以为我真就得意洋洋，看不出自己是一个傻瓜吗？想到这上头，连我自己都脸红；我要是有能耐的话，在我这年龄，我怎么也不要人把我当糊涂虫看。”
    她不等做“贤妻良母”，就揭穿了男子的自私打算。这是第一部正面提出社会问题，特别是妇女问题的近代戏剧。易卜生继承这尖锐批评夫权思想的战斗传统，然而放下喜剧特殊性格，用严格的生活形式，写成亲切易感的正剧——一个现代剧种。
    时至今日，这类社会问题已经接近解决了。民主国家已经把男女平等订在自己的宪法里面。妇女权利有了明确的保障。三位剧作家如果还活着的话，我相信会以一种胜利心情，欢迎民主国家这种具有革命性的英明作为的。（续完）
