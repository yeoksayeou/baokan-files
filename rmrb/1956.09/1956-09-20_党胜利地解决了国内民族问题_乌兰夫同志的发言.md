Comrade Ulanhu's speech

    I fully agree with the Political Report of the Central Committee, the Report on the Revision of Party Constitution, and the Report on the Proposals for the Second Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy.
    During the period from the Seventh National Congress to the Eighth National Congress, the work of the Party Central Committee in leading the people of all ethnic groups in the country to complete the democratic revolution and implement the socialist revolution was entirely correct, and the work done in solving domestic ethnic issues was also correct and achieved great victories. Currently, all minority ethnic groups in our country are undergoing or preparing the conditions for socialist transformation and socialist construction. The common tasks of the Party and the people of all ethnic groups in ethnic issues are: to further consolidate the unification of the motherland and develop fraternal friendship and mutual assistance and cooperation among all ethnic groups, to further consolidate the internal unity of all minority ethnic groups, to give full play to the enthusiasm of minority ethnic groups in building the motherland and building socialism, to help all minority ethnic groups transition to socialist society one after another, to build the motherland into a strong socialist country, and through long-term efforts, to achieve equality among all ethnic groups in terms of economic and cultural development levels.
    The implementation of the policy of ethnic regional autonomy is of great significance to the unification of the motherland, ethnic equality, ethnic unity, and ethnic development.
    The basic policy of our Party in solving domestic ethnic issues is ethnic regional autonomy. The implementation of this policy is of great significance to the great cause of the unification of the motherland, ethnic equality, ethnic unity, and ethnic development. This policy was put forward by our Party under the historical conditions of our country based on the principles of Marxism-Leninism on ethnic issues and the experience of the Chinese revolution. As early as the Anti-Japanese War period, the Party proposed and implemented the policy of ethnic regional autonomy in the liberated areas, and in practice, it has continuously enriched the content of this policy. Historical facts have proved that it fully conforms to the actual situation of ethnic issues in China and the common aspirations of all ethnic groups, and is a completely correct policy.
    Historically, there has long been a system of ethnic oppression in our country, which has created mutual discrimination and estrangement between ethnic groups, and there have also been phenomena of ethnic division. However, the people of all ethnic groups living together on the land of our country have developed production through their own hard work and jointly created the history and culture of the motherland and all ethnic groups. In the long-term contact and exchanges, all ethnic groups have developed economic ties and cultural exchanges, and have repeatedly jointly resisted foreign aggression. Despite the existence of a system of ethnic oppression in history, the relationship of mutual assistance between ethnic groups has continued to develop. The invasion of China by imperialism, especially Japanese imperialism, has completely linked the fate of all ethnic groups together. With a powerful enemy in front, all ethnic groups must make a choice: either eliminate estrangement, enhance trust, and unite the strength of all ethnic groups to defeat imperialism and feudalism and bureaucratic capitalism colluding with imperialism, seek liberation together, and establish a strong motherland sufficient to defend all ethnic groups; or divide all ethnic groups, each going its own way, thus leading to a fate of eternal oppression. The people of all ethnic groups in China are worthy of being heroic people and brothers and sisters of the great motherland. Naturally, they cannot tolerate any oppression. Through the revolutionary struggle since the Opium War, especially in the revolutionary struggle under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, they have realized their highest aspiration of uniting to seek liberation, and finally defeated the common enemy. Due to the long-term revolutionary struggle of more than 100 years, especially in the past 30 years, the relationship of mutual assistance between ethnic groups in history has not been weakened but further developed, the antagonistic state between ethnic groups has been greatly changed, the internationalist and patriotic consciousness of the people of all ethnic groups has been greatly enhanced, especially the ethnic relations of equality, unity, mutual assistance, and cooperation under the leadership of the Communist Party based on common political ideals and consistent interests have been tempered and tested. Therefore, after defeating the common enemy, all ethnic groups in China chose to establish a unified multi-ethnic country based on historical experience, and implement the road of ethnic regional autonomy in this big family of all ethnic groups. All these show that it is the desire of the people of all ethnic groups to live together in a big family of the motherland, and it is also the inevitable result of historical development.
    In a country transitioning to socialism, implementing ethnic regional autonomy is fully in line with the principles of socialist democracy and ethnic equality. The benefits of ethnic regional autonomy are: it can realize the right of minority ethnic groups to be masters of their own affairs, and develop their own ethnic groups according to their own conditions and characteristics; and it can unite all fraternal ethnic groups in a unified country on the basis of completely equal status and rights, help each other, jointly manage their own country and develop their own country; thus, it is more convenient for the development of each ethnic group itself. Obviously, the implementation of ethnic regional autonomy is completely necessary and beneficial to the common cause of the working class and the people of all ethnic groups in our country, and can properly solve the ethnic issues in our country. We should unswervingly continue to implement it.
    Achievements in implementing the Party's ethnic policies and shortcomings in current work
    All ethnic groups enjoy the right to ethnic equality; minority ethnic groups living in concentrated communities have the right to implement regional autonomy, be masters of their own affairs in autonomous areas, and manage their internal affairs; the Party and the state must help them to fully realize these rights. Due to the implementation of such policies, twenty-seven minority ethnic groups have now established two autonomous regions, twenty-seven autonomous prefectures, and forty-three autonomous counties in their respective concentrated areas. The preparatory committees for the Tibet Autonomous Region and the Yunnan Bai Autonomous Prefecture have also been established. The politics, economy, and culture of all ethnic autonomous areas have been developed; the interests of minority ethnic groups living in mixed and scattered areas have also been taken care of as they should be, and the lives of the people of minority ethnic groups have also been improved and raised. The agricultural output of minority ethnic areas has increased by nearly half on average compared to the highest annual output before liberation; the number of livestock in pastoral areas has increased by nearly doubled on average; and 423 modern industries have been established. In the three autonomous prefectures and eleven autonomous counties that had no modern industry or even handicraft industry in the past, their own modern industries have appeared for the first time. Among the minority ethnic groups that never had a primary school, a hospital, or a store, there are now schools, hospitals, and stores. The Tibetan Plateau, which was always closed to traffic, has been opened to highways and air routes. The Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, the Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Prefecture, and other minority ethnic areas, which never had economic and cultural centers, have new cities. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region are also building large-scale industrial bases for iron and steel, non-ferrous metals, and petroleum. More than 11 million people of minority ethnic groups without written languages are creating their own written languages. Preliminary written language schemes have been formulated for Zhuang, Yi, and Kyrgyz languages. These situations specifically illustrate the undeniable achievements of our work.
    However, there are still shortcomings in our work. For example, the ethnicization of some ethnic autonomous organs and the work of training minority ethnic cadres have not been done well enough, especially the promotion of minority ethnic cadres to the leading positions of the Party has not been done well enough. Some ethnic minority members of the Party committees of some autonomous prefectures and autonomous counties have not increased in recent years; the right of some autonomous areas to manage finance and undertakings is sometimes restricted. Many local industries, schools, and other undertakings that should be established cannot be established even if they are proposed many times; the work of creating and promoting minority ethnic languages has not received strong and practical support; in dealing with internal affairs in autonomous areas, there are still situations where the right of minority ethnic cadres to be masters of their own affairs is not respected, but the Han cadres working there take care of everything instead. Even within the Party organizations in autonomous areas, there are still situations where, when dealing with issues related to a certain ethnic group, they do not consult with the Party member cadres of that ethnic group, or even the Party member cadres who bear considerable responsibility, do not respect the opinions of the local ethnic Party member cadres, and even do not allow them to participate in matters that they should participate in. These phenomena must be corrected.
    Of course, it is also necessary for minority ethnic cadres to respect the Han cadres and other ethnic cadres working there. There are phenomena of disrespect in individual areas and individual units, which must be corrected.
    Helping minority ethnic groups develop in all aspects is the unshirkable responsibility of the Han people
    Respecting the equal rights and autonomous rights of all ethnic groups does not mean that the Han working class can reduce its unshirkable responsibility to help minority ethnic groups develop in all aspects. Minority ethnic groups should rely on their own efforts to transition to socialist society, but they must also obtain the help of all fraternal ethnic groups, especially the Han people. They have every right to receive this kind of help. Han comrades should not only generally work in minority ethnic areas, but especially have the responsibility to help minority ethnic groups create conditions, train cadres, and promote them to fully realize their ethnic equal rights and autonomous rights, give full play to their own strength, and realize socialist transformation and socialist construction themselves. Obviously, this kind of help is precisely to respect the rights of minority ethnic groups. If they hold an attitude of disrespect or unwillingness to respect the rights of minority ethnic groups and adopt a method of taking care of everything instead, it is impossible to realize this selfless help.
    In socialist construction, helping minority ethnic groups develop, and treating all ethnic groups, there should be no discrimination or contempt. In socialist construction, especially the key construction of industry, there must also be reasonable arrangements. Whether a certain project of economic and cultural construction should be carried out in a certain area or a certain ethnic group, and when it can be carried out, is because this area and this ethnic group actually have the conditions to carry out this construction, so the state makes such arrangements, which is by no means special treatment. However, all ethnic groups should carry out political, economic, and cultural construction according to the actual situation and conditions. The state must help all ethnic groups not only to be equal in political status, but also to help them gradually achieve equality in the level of economic and cultural development. Therefore, the construction of all ethnic groups requires help from all aspects, especially from the higher-level people's governments, and those ethnic groups that are relatively backward in development and have more difficult conditions need more care and attention. Paying attention only to helping large ethnic groups in area, ignoring small ethnic groups in area; paying attention only to those with large populations, ignoring those with small populations; paying attention only to the advanced, ignoring the backward; paying attention only to those living in concentrated communities, ignoring those living in mixed and scattered areas; paying attention only to those with more problems in work, ignoring those with fewer problems; paying attention only to construction work, ignoring the actual improvement and improvement of the material and cultural lives of the people of minority ethnic groups; are all inappropriate.
    To help minority ethnic groups develop political, economic, and cultural undertakings, special attention must be paid to establishing and developing industry in all minority ethnic areas. During the second and third five-year plans, we should help the industry of all ethnic autonomous regions to have a larger scale of development in a planned and focused manner, and all autonomous prefectures and autonomous counties should have a certain number of industries of different scales, and develop transportation accordingly. Special attention should be paid to cultivating the working class in all ethnic autonomous areas. We should help all minority ethnic groups, especially in those areas with relatively backward economies and cultures, to establish and develop economic and cultural centers.
    Attention should be paid to the fact that production technology and increased production plans should not be required to be at the level of the Han areas. Cultural and educational work should not be carried out in the form and system of the Han areas. The establishment of institutions and the budget of funds should not be decided entirely according to the standards of the Han areas. The situations of minority ethnic areas and Han areas, as well as the situations between various minority ethnic areas, are different. Therefore, under the unified principle, there must be some supplementary methods or separate methods applicable to minority ethnic areas. The practice of demanding uniformity is not feasible or appropriate.
    Democratic reforms and socialist transformations must be implemented in accordance with the characteristics and conditions of each ethnic group.
    At present, the socialist transformation has been basically completed in minority ethnic areas with a population of about 28 million, the socialist transformation is underway in areas with a population of about 2.2 million, the democratic reform is underway in areas with a population of about 2 million, and the democratic reform has not yet begun in areas with a population of only more than 3 million. Obviously, various democratic reforms—land reform, liberation of slaves, etc.—and socialist transformations must and inevitably be realized in these minority ethnic areas where reforms have not yet been carried out. Seeing the benefits of socialism, but thinking that socialist economic and cultural construction can be carried out without democratic reforms and socialist transformations, and thus socialism can be realized, is naive. The high development of production and socialist economic and cultural construction can never be realized while the old class relations and the exploitation system are preserved. As for the idea of trying to avoid or even oppose reform, it is even more contrary to the most fundamental interests of the people of all ethnic groups, because without reform, it is impossible to eliminate the exploitation system, completely liberate all ethnic groups and the people of all ethnic groups, and it is impossible to develop one's own ethnic group.
    Democratic reforms and socialist transformations in minority ethnic areas must be carried out fully in accordance with the different characteristics and special circumstances of each ethnic group. Thinking that all ethnic groups are going to realize socialism, or are realizing socialism, so all work can be carried out in the same way as in the Han or other ethnic groups without any difference, and there is no need to pay attention to the differences between ethnic groups, the wishes and awareness level of the people of all ethnic groups, and the historical ethnic estrangement between ethnic groups, etc. These important factors have an impact on work, and it is impossible to take work steps, work methods, and specific policies suitable for the specific circumstances of each ethnic group, which is only harmful to work and not beneficial. Some comrades may think that mechanically copying the methods of the Han or other ethnic groups may be simpler and the time may be shorter. However, the fact is just the opposite. Any practice that does not proceed from the actual situation and is eager to complete the task will inevitably lead to problems, take detours, and only prolong the time. For the reform of minority ethnic groups, taking more stable steps, and even making some necessary waiting, and thus lengthening the time, precisely reflects the actual situation and actual needs of ethnic issues.
    The Central Committee of the Party's political report proposed that reforms should be carried out in a peaceful way in minority ethnic areas where democratic reforms and socialist transformations have not yet been carried out, and no forceful struggle should be adopted. It is correct, and experience has proved that it is possible to do so. When to take what steps and work methods to carry out democratic reforms and socialist transformations in minority ethnic areas should be considered by the minority ethnic groups themselves; and long-term unity and cooperation with the upper-level figures should be carried out, and things should be discussed. Doing so may make us make some concessions on the specific issues of the steps and work methods of reform, but if it is beneficial to the work, we should make some necessary concessions.
    Democratic reforms and socialist transformations in minority ethnic pastoral areas should also be carried out in a peaceful way, relying on the laboring herdsmen, uniting all the forces that can be united, and steadily carrying out the reforms on the basis of steadily developing animal husbandry production. According to the different situations and conditions of the pastoral areas, some areas can carry out socialist transformations after completing democratic reforms, and some areas can complete the task of democratic reforms while carrying out socialist transformations. In the process of carrying out democratic reforms and socialist transformations, we should continue to implement the long-term effective policies of not fighting, not dividing, not classifying classes, benefiting both herdsmen and herdsmen owners, and supporting poor herdsmen to produce, increase livestock, and protect livestock.
    For individual minority ethnic groups that have basically not formed a class society, or whose class differentiation is extremely unclear, we should vigorously support them in developing production, and in the process of gradually improving the economic and cultural level of the local people, adopt persuasion and education methods, and help them gradually change the unfavorable and harmful factors for their own ethnic development, change the old relations of production, and complete socialist transformations through the road of cooperation.
    Boldly use and promote minority ethnic cadres, and gradually realize the ethnicization of the Party's leading organs
    Building the Party and training cadres in minority ethnic groups, especially training the leading backbone and the core leading force of the Party, is the key to determining everything in the Party's work in minority ethnic groups. In the past, our Party adopted the policy of actively and cautiously developing the Party and universally and extensively training minority ethnic cadres in minority ethnic groups, developing nearly 300,000 Communist Party members and training 210,000 Party and non-Party cadres. In the future, we should continue to develop the Party and train cadres, and especially should help all ethnic autonomous areas to formulate plans for training cadres, and gradually make the cadres of this ethnic group in the general autonomous organs and their subordinate enterprises, schools, and people's organizations and the Party's leading organs generally account for the majority in number, take the main responsibility in work, and cultivate the scientific, technical, educational, and artistic intellectuals of minority ethnic groups. The training of minority ethnic cadres should also pay attention to the training of women cadres.
    Merely realizing the ethnicization of the autonomous organs, and not realizing the ethnicization of the Party's leading organs, and the Party's leading organs are still not composed mainly of cadres of this ethnic group, has not completely realized the principle of ethnic regional autonomy, and it is still not easy to fully implement the Party's leadership in minority ethnic groups. Therefore, gradually realizing the ethnicization of the Party's leading organs is a fundamental task.
    The important issue in training minority ethnic cadres is to trust them, and to boldly use and promote them; not only should we help them make progress and cultivate their abilities, but also we should believe in their progress and believe in their abilities, and let them do their work independently and responsibly. We should cherish the feelings of minority ethnic cadres who love their own ethnic group and care about the legitimate interests of their own ethnic group, and should not criticize these feelings. The reason why we value minority ethnic cadres is precisely because they have particularly close ties with the people of their own ethnic group, have a particularly ardent desire for the liberation and development of their own ethnic group, they are particularly able to reflect the wishes of the people of their own ethnic group, and they are particularly able to represent the interests of their own ethnic group. Therefore, it is completely legitimate and necessary for minority ethnic cadres to love the motherland and at the same time love their own ethnic group. It is precisely a manifestation of the awareness of patriotism and internationalism. The motherland and all ethnic groups need more such cadres.
    There must be a group of Han cadres who are determined to dedicate themselves to the cause of minority ethnic groups, that is, to the common cause of the motherland, to go to minority ethnic areas to help minority ethnic groups work, which is extremely beneficial to the various tasks and construction undertakings of minority ethnic groups. Han cadres and minority ethnic cadres should unite closely, trust each other, help each other, respect and understand each other, and learn from each other's strengths.
    At present, we must pay special attention to opposing Han chauvinism and continue to implement the policy of steady progress.
    At present, the class foundation for the emergence of Han chauvinism and local nationalism is gradually changing and disappearing, and after repeated education by the Party and the government for several years, the influence and remnants of Han chauvinism and local nationalism have also been overcome a lot. However, in the work of some comrades, there are sometimes ideological tendencies of Han chauvinism and local nationalism, and some are serious.
    At present, the main manifestations of Han chauvinism ideological tendencies are: ignoring the characteristics of minority ethnic groups, not caring about the interests of minority ethnic groups, ignoring the role of minority ethnic groups in the socialist construction of the motherland, not seeing the development and progress of minority ethnic groups, not respecting the equal rights and autonomous rights of minority ethnic groups, copying the work experience of Han areas, and taking care of everything instead. The main manifestations of local nationalism ideological tendencies are: excessively emphasizing the special circumstances of the ethnic group, not seeing the overall interests of the country and the long-term interests of the ethnic group, not seeing the future of ethnic development, and not willing to accept the beneficial experience and help of other ethnic groups. Both of these ideological tendencies must be prevented and overcome. At present, special attention should be paid to the danger of Han chauvinism ideological tendencies. However, we should never accuse individual and temporary mistakes in work and individual and temporary shortcomings in the ideological style of some comrades as systematic Han chauvinism and local nationalism ideological tendencies.
    Han chauvinism and local nationalism ideologies have deep historical and social roots, and it will take long-term efforts and long-term education to completely overcome them. In the foreseeable future, we cannot relax the important task of opposing these two ideological tendencies.
    The Party has always adopted a policy of steady progress in its work in minority ethnic areas, and must base its work plans and policies and measures on a reliable, stable, and practical basis according to the specific characteristics of minority ethnic groups, and steadily carry them out. If the conditions for carrying out the work are not ripe, we can wait for some time. We oppose the error of being impatient and rashly advancing, ignoring the difficulties in the work, exaggerating the favorable conditions, blindly catching up with the progress and speed of the Han areas and other ethnic areas, and forcing things that cannot be done at present or should not be done temporarily. Years of experience have proved that this is a correct work policy that conforms to the situation of minority ethnic groups and ethnic relations in our country.
    The policy of steady progress is a realistic and positive policy, not a conservative policy. In the work of minority ethnic groups, the error of exaggerating the difficulties of the work, not seeing the progress of the work, the changes in the situation, and the increase in favorable conditions, not actively doing things that can be done through efforts, or not daring to do things when the conditions are ripe, is also necessary to oppose. If we do not understand the cautious attitude of the policy of steady progress, or do not understand its positive significance, it is impossible to do a good job in the work of minority ethnic areas.
    From the Seventh National Congress of the Party to the Eighth National Congress, the work done by our Party in solving ethnic issues is a good example of correctly and creatively applying Marxism-Leninism in combination with the actual situation in China to solve ethnic issues. We have gained a lot of experience in the cause of establishing and building a unified multi-ethnic People's Republic of China. I think it is beneficial for comrades of all ethnic groups to often review these experiences.
    Because our Party has successfully solved the domestic ethnic issues, the Party enjoys extremely high trust among all ethnic groups in China. However, our task has not been completed and our responsibility is still very heavy. Comrades of all ethnic groups should continue to make resolute and unremitting struggles under the leadership of the Party and together with the people of all ethnic groups. (Attached picture)

专栏：

    党胜利地解决了国内民族问题
    乌兰夫同志的发言
    我完全同意中央委员会的政治报告，关于修改党章的报告和关于发展国民经济的第二个五年计划的建议的报告。
    党中央在第七次全国代表大会到第八次全国代表大会这个期间，领导全国各民族人民为完成民主革命和实行社会主义革命所进行的工作是完全正确的，在解决国内民族问题方面所作的工作也是正确的，取得了伟大的胜利。现在，我国各少数民族都正在进行或者正在准备条件将要进行社会主义改造和社会主义建设。党和各民族人民在民族问题方面的共同任务就是：进一步巩固祖国的统一和发展各民族间兄弟友爱和互助合作关系，进一步巩固各少数民族内部的团结，发挥少数民族人民建设祖国和建设社会主义的积极性，帮助各少数民族先后过渡到社会主义社会，把祖国建成强大的社会主义国家，并且经过长期努力，使各民族在经济、文化的发展水平上达到平等地位。
    实现民族区域自治的政策，对祖国统一、民族平等、民族团结和民族发展具有重大意义
    我党解决国内民族问题的基本政策是民族区域自治，这个政策的实现，对于祖国统一、民族平等、民族团结和民族发展的伟大事业具有重大的意义。这个政策是我党在我国的历史条件下根据马克思列宁主义关于民族问题的原理和中国革命的经验提出的。远在抗日战争时期，党就提出了并且在解放区实行了民族区域自治的政策，在实践中更不断地丰富了这个政策的内容，历史事实证明它完全符合中国民族问题的实际情况和各民族的共同愿望，是完全正确的政策。
    我国历史上长期存在着民族压迫制度，造成了民族间的互相歧视和隔阂，并且也发生过民族间的分裂现象。但是，共同生存在我国土地上的各民族人民用自己辛勤的劳动发展了生产，共同创造了祖国的和各民族的历史和文化。各民族在长期的接触往来中，发展了经济上的联系和文化上的交流，并且多次共同抵抗了外来的侵略，尽管历史上存在着民族压迫制度，民族间的互助关系还是不断地得到发展。帝国主义、特别是日本帝国主义侵略中国，使各民族的命运完全联系在一起了。大敌当前，迫使各民族必须作一种选择：或者破除隔阂，增强信任，各民族的力量团结起来战胜帝国主义以及和帝国主义勾结的封建主义、官僚资本主义，共求解放，建立足以保卫各个民族的强大的祖国；或者各民族分裂，各行其是，因而招致永远受压迫的命运。中国各民族人民都不愧为英雄的人民和伟大祖国的兄弟儿女，自然是不能忍受任何压迫的，经历了从鸦片战争以来的革命斗争，特别是在中国共产党领导下的革命斗争中，实现了自己团结共求解放的最高意愿，终于战胜了共同的敌人。由于一百多年来特别是在近三十多年来长期的革命斗争的烈火中，不是削弱而是更发展了历史上民族间的互助关系，大大改变了民族间的对立状态，大大提高了各民族人民的国际主义和爱国主义觉悟，尤其是锻炼和考验了在共产党领导下的有着共同的政治理想和一致利益作基础的平等、团结、互助、合作的民族关系，因而在战胜了共同的敌人之后，中国各民族根据历史经验选择了建立统一的多民族国家，并且在这个各民族大家庭内实行民族区域自治的道路。所有这些都说明各民族共同生活在一个祖国大家庭内是各民族人民的愿望，也是历史发展必然的结果。
    在一个向社会主义过渡的国家内，实行民族区域自治是充分符合社会主义民主和民族平等原则的。民族区域自治的好处是：可以实现少数民族当家作主的权利，按照自己的情况和特点来发展自己的民族；又可以在完全平等的地位和权利的基础上，团结各兄弟民族在统一的大国内，互助合作，共同管理自己的国家和发展自己的国家；因而就更便利于各民族自己的发展。很明显，实现民族区域自治，对我国工人阶级和各民族人民共同的事业是完全必要的、有利的，能够恰当地解决我国的民族问题。我们应该坚定不渝地继续贯彻执行。
    执行党的民族政策的成就和目前工作中的缺点
    任何民族都一律享有民族平等的权利；聚居的少数民族，都有实行区域自治、在自治地方当家作主、管理自己内部事务的权利；党和国家必须帮助他们来充分实现这些权利。由于实行了这样的政策，现在已经有二十七个少数民族分别在自己的聚居区内建立了两个自治区、二十七个自治州和四十三个自治县，还成立了西藏自治区和云南白族自治州的筹备委员会。各民族自治地方的政治、经济和文化都得到了发展；杂居的和散居的少数民族的利益也得到了应有的照顾，少数民族人民的生活也有了改善和提高。少数民族地区的农业产量比解放前的最高年产量平均增加了将近半倍；牧业区的牲畜头数平均增加了将近一倍；并且已经建立了四百二十三个现代工业。在过去没有现代工业的甚至没有工场手工业的三个自治州和十一个自治县内，第一次出现了自己的现代工业。从来没有一所小学、一所医院和一所商店的少数民族中，现在有了学校、医院和商店，从来是交通闭塞的西藏高原，修通了公路，并且开辟了航空线。从来没有经济、文化中心的海南黎族苗族自治州、湘西苗族自治州和其他少数民族地区，出现了新的城市。内蒙古自治区和新疆维吾尔自治区并且正在建设规模巨大的钢铁、有色金属和石油的工业基地。没有文字的一千一百余万人口的少数民族，正在创制自己的文字，僮文、彝文和柯尔克孜文已经初步制定文字方案。这些情况具体地说明了我们的工作获得了不可置疑的成就。
    但是，我们的工作中还是有缺点的。例如，有些民族自治机关的民族化和培养少数民族干部的工作作得很不够，特别是提拔少数民族干部到党的领导工作岗位上来作得不够，有些自治州和自治县党委员会的少数民族成员几年来都没有增加；有些自治地方管理财政和事业的权利有时还受限制，不少应该兴办的地方工业、学校和其他事业，虽然多次提出，也不能举办；少数民族文字的创制和推行的工作得不到有力的、实际的支持；在处理自治地方内部事务的问题上，现在还有不尊重少数民族干部自己当家作主的权利，而由在那里工作的汉族干部包办代替的情况；就是在自治地方的党组织内也还是有在处理某个民族的有关问题的时候，不去和那个民族的党员干部甚至负有相当责任的党员干部商量，不尊重当地民族党员干部的意见，甚至不让他们与闻应该与闻的事的情况。这些现象必须改正。
    当然，少数民族干部对于在那里工作的汉族干部和其他民族干部的尊重也是必要的，现在个别地区、个别单位有不尊重的现象，必须改正。
    帮助少数民族在各方面得到发展，是汉族人民的无可推卸的责任
    尊重各民族的平等权利和自治权利，不等于可以减轻汉族的工人阶级帮助少数民族各方面得到发展的无可推卸的责任。少数民族要过渡到社会主义社会，应该依靠自己的努力，同时还必须取得各兄弟民族首先是汉族的帮助，他们完全有权利得到这种帮助。汉族的同志不仅应该一般地在少数民族地区作工作，并且特别有责任在工作中帮助少数民族创造条件，培养干部，促成他们充分实现民族平等权利和自治权利，充分发挥他们自己的力量并且由他们自己来实现社会主义改造和社会主义建设。很明显，这种帮助正是为了尊重少数民族的权利，如果抱着不尊重或不愿意尊重少数民族权利的态度和采取包办代替的办法去工作，就不可能实现这种无私的帮助。
    在社会主义建设中，帮助少数民族发展，对待所有的民族，都不可有任何歧视和轻视。在社会主义建设中，特别是工业的重点建设，又必须有合理的安排，在某个地区或某个民族中应该进行某种项目的经济、文化建设和可以在什么时候进行，是由于这个地区和这个民族中实际上具备了进行这种建设的条件，因而国家才作这样的安排，决不是什么特殊待遇。但是所有的民族都应该根据实际的情况和条件进行政治、经济、文化方面的建设，国家必须帮助各个民族不仅在政治地位上应该平等，并且国家还必须帮助他们在经济和文化发展的水平上逐渐达到平等。因此，各个民族的建设都需要来自各方面的尤其是来自上级人民政府的帮助，特别是那些发展比较落后和条件更为困难的民族需要更多的照顾和关心。只注意帮助地区大的民族，忽视地区小的民族；只注意人口多的，忽视人口少的；只注意先进的，忽视落后的；只注意聚居的，忽视杂居和散居的；只注意工作中存在问题多的，忽视问题少的；只注意建设工作，忽视少数民族人民的物质和文化生活实际的改善和提高；都是不适当的。
    帮助少数民族发展政治、经济和文化的事业，必须特别重视在各少数民族地区建立和发展工业，应该有计划、有重点地在第二个和第三个五年计划期间，帮助各民族自治区的工业都能够有较大规模的发展，各自治州和自治县都能够有一定数量的不同规模的工业，并且相应地发展交通运输事业。应该特别注意在各民族自治地方培养工人阶级。应该帮助各少数民族，特别是在那些经济、文化比较落后的地区，建立和发展经济、文化中心。
    应该注意生产技术和增产计划不要勉强按照汉族地区的水平提出要求，文化教育工作不要一律按照汉族地区的形式和制度办事，机构编制和经费预算不要完全按照汉族地区的标准来作决定。少数民族地区和汉族地区以及各个少数民族地区之间的情况都不相同。因此在统一的原则下必须有适用于少数民族地区的某种补充的办法或单独的办法，强求一致的作法，行不通也不适当。
    必须根据各民族的特点和情况，实行民主改革和社会主义改造
    现在，已经有大约二千八百万人口的少数民族地区基本上完成了社会主义改造，大约二百二十万人口的地区正在进行社会主义改造；大约二百万人口的地区正在进行民主改革，只有三百多万人口的地区还没有开始进行民主改革。很明显，在这些还没有进行改革的少数民族地区必须也不可避免要实现各种民主改革——土地改革、解放奴隶等等——和社会主义改造。看到了社会主义的好处，但是，认为不经过民主改革和社会主义改造也可以进行社会主义的经济、文化建设，因而也可以实现社会主义的想法是幼稚的；生产的高度发展和社会主义的经济、文化建设，绝对不能够在旧的阶级关系和剥削制度保存的情况下来实现。至于企图规避甚至反对改革的想法，更是违背了各民族人民最根本的利益，因为不改革就不可能消灭剥削制度、彻底解放各个民族和各民族人民，也不可能发展自己的民族。　　少数民族地区的民主改革和社会主义改造，必须充分根据各民族的不同特点和特殊情况去进行，以为各民族既然都要实现社会主义，或者正在实现社会主义，因而一切工作都可以和在汉族或者在别的民族中同样地毫无区别地去进行，没有必要再去注意民族间的差别、各民族人民的意愿和觉悟水平、民族间历史上残留的民族隔阂等这些重要因素对工作的影响，可以不采取适合于各民族具体情况的工作步骤、工作方式和具体政策，对工作只有害处没有好处。有的同志也许以为机械搬套汉族的或者别的民族的办法，事情可能会更简单些，时间可能会更短些。但是，事实恰好相反，凡是不从实际情况出发，急于完成任务的作法，就必然会出问题、走弯路，时间只会更拖长。对于少数民族的改革问题，步子稳妥一些，甚至作某种必要的等待，因而时间放长一些，正是反映了民族问题的实际情况和实际需要。
    党中央政治报告提出在还没有进行民主改革和社会主义改造的少数民族地区进行改革，必须坚持和平的方式，不要采取强力斗争的方式，是正确的，经验证明这样作是可能的。少数民族地区在什么时候采取什么步骤和工作方法进行民主改革和社会主义改造，应该由少数民族自己去考虑；并且应该和上层人物长期团结合作，协商办事；这样作，可能会使我们在改革的步骤和工作方法的具体问题上作某些让步，但是，如果有利于工作，我们就应该作某种必要的让步。
    少数民族牧业区的民主改革和社会主义改造，也应该采取和平方式，依靠劳动牧民，团结一切可以团结的力量，在稳定地发展畜牧业生产的基础上，稳步地去进行。根据牧业区的不同情况和条件，有些地区可以在完成民主改革之后去进行社会主义改造，有些地区可以在社会主义改造的过程中同时去完成民主改革的任务。在进行民主改革和社会主义改造的过程中，应该继续执行多年来行之有效的不斗不分不划阶级、牧主，牧民两利，扶持贫苦牧民生产和增畜保畜的政策。
    对于个别基本上尚未形成阶级社会，或者阶级分化极不明显的少数民族，应该大力扶持他们发展生产，在当地人民的经济、文化水平逐步提高的过程中，采取说服教育办法，通过合作化的道路，帮助他们逐步地改变对于自己民族发展不利的、有害的因素，改变旧的生产关系，完成社会主义改造。
    大胆使用和提拔少数民族干部，逐步实现党的领导机关民族化
    在少数民族中建设党和培养干部，特别是培养党的领导骨干和核心的领导力量，是党在少数民族中进行工作的决定一切的关键。过去我党在少数民族中采取了积极、慎重地发展党和普遍、大量地培养少数民族干部的方针，发展了将近三十万共产党员和培养了二十一万党和非党的干部。今后应该继续发展党和培养干部，特别应该帮助各民族自治地方制定培养干部的规划，逐步使各自治机关和它所属的企业、学校以及人民团体和党的领导机关的本民族干部一般的在数量上占到多数，在工作上负主要责任，并且培养少数民族的科学、技术、教育、文艺的知识分子。培养少数民族干部，还应该重视妇女干部的培养。
    仅仅实现自治机关民族化，不去实现党的领导机关的民族化，党的领导机关仍然不是由本民族的干部为主组成，就还没有彻底实现民族区域自治的原则，就还不容易在少数民族中完全贯彻党的领导。所以逐步实现党的领导机关民族化，是一个带根本性的任务。
    培养少数民族干部的重要问题是信任他们，要大胆放手地使用和提拔他们；不仅应该帮助他们进步和培养他们的能力，并且应该相信他们的进步和相信他们的能力，让他们独立负责地去做工作。应该珍惜少数民族干部热爱自己民族和关心自己民族正当利益的情感，不要去非难这种情感。我们所以重视少数民族干部，恰好是因为他们和本民族人民群众有着特别密切的联系，对本民族的解放和发展事业有着特别热烈的愿望，他们特别能够反映自己民族人民的意愿，并且特别能够代表自己民族的利益。因此少数民族干部热爱祖国同时又热爱自己的民族，是完全正当的，应该的，正是具有爱国主义和国际主义的觉悟的表现，祖国和各民族正需要更多这样的干部。
    必须有一批决心献身于少数民族事业也就是献身于祖国的共同事业的汉族干部到少数民族地区去帮助少数民族工作，这对少数民族的各项工作和各项建设事业是极为有利的。汉族干部和少数民族干部应该亲密团结，互相信任，互相帮助，互相尊重和谅解，互相学习彼此的长处。
    目前要特别注意反对大汉族主义，继续贯彻执行稳步前进的方针
    现在产生大汉族主义和地方民族主义的阶级基础正在逐渐改变和消灭，并且几年来经过党和政府的反复教育，大汉族主义和地方民族主义的影响和残余也已经克服了许多。但是，在一些同志的工作中有时还会表现出大汉族主义和地方民族主义的思想倾向，有些并且是严重的。
    目前，大汉族主义思想倾向的主要表现是：忽视少数民族的特点，不关心少数民族的利益，忽视少数民族在祖国社会主义建设中的作用，看不清少数民族中发展和进步的情况，不尊重少数民族的平等权利和自治权利，搬套汉族地区的工作经验，包办代替。地方民族主义思想倾向的主要表现是：过分强调民族的特殊情况，看不清国家的整体利益和民族的长远利益，看不清民族发展的前途，不愿意接受别的民族有益的经验和帮助。这两种思想倾向都必须防止和克服，目前特别要注意大汉族主义思想倾向的危险。但是决不应该把工作中的个别的一时的错误和某些同志思想作风上个别的一时的缺点都指责为系统的大汉族主义和地方民族主义思想倾向。
    大汉族主义和地方民族主义思想有很深的历史和社会的根源，必须经过长期努力和长期教育才能彻底克服。在今后相当长的时期内，我们不能放松反对这两种思想倾向的重要任务。
    党在少数民族地区进行工作，一向采取稳步前进的工作方针，务必根据少数民族的具体特点，使工作计划和政策措施等等都建立在有把握的、稳妥的、切实可靠的基础上，并且稳步地去进行；如果进行工作的条件不成熟，可以作某种等待；反对那种忽视工作中的困难，夸大有利条件，盲目地追赶汉族地区和其他民族地区的进度和速度，对于目前还作不到或者暂时还不应该去作的事情勉强去作的急躁冒进的错误。多年来的经验证明，这是一个符合我国少数民族情况和民族关系情况的正确的工作方针。
    稳步前进的方针，是一个实事求是的、积极的方针，不是保守的方针。在少数民族工作中那种夸大工作困难，看不到工作的进展、情况的变化和有利条件的增加，对于经过努力可以作到的事情不积极去作，或者条件具备的时候不敢去作的保守不进的错误，也是必须反对的。不理解稳步前进工作方针的慎重态度，或者不理解它的积极意义，都不可能作好少数民族地区的工作。
    从党的第七次代表大会到第八次代表大会这个期间，我党在解决民族问题方面所作的工作，是正确地创造性地运用马克思列宁主义结合中国实际情况解决民族问题的良好范例，我们在建立和建设统一的多民族的中华人民共和国的事业中获得了不少经验。我认为各民族的同志经常温习这些经验是有益的。
    由于我党胜利地解决了国内民族问题，党在中国各民族中享有极高的信任。但是，我们的任务还没有完成，责任还很重大。各民族的同志应该在党的领导下和各民族人民在一起，继续作坚决不懈的奋斗。（附图片）
