    Ceylon
    The Pearl of the Orient

    Ceylon is an island nation in the Indian Ocean, separated from India by the thirty-five-kilometer-wide Palk Strait. Looking at a map, it resembles a beautiful pearl hanging from the southern tip of India, hence the nickname "Pearl of the Orient." Ceylon is approximately four hundred and thirty kilometers long from north to south and two hundred and twenty-five kilometers wide from east to west, with a total area of sixty-five thousand five hundred and eighty-four square kilometers. The northern coastal areas are mostly vast plains. The western coastline is relatively straight, with numerous lakes connecting to bays. The central and southern regions are mountainous, covering a quarter of the island's area. The famous Adam's Peak, rising seven thousand four hundred feet above sea level, is a religious sanctuary in Ceylon.

    Tea-Producing Garden

    Ceylon is known as the "tea-producing garden." The national tea plantation area reaches more than 560,000 acres, and its output ranks third in the world, second only to China and India. Ceylon black tea is world-renowned and accounts for the largest share of Ceylon's exports. However, 80% of Ceylon's tea plantations are controlled by British companies. The second major product is rubber, with output ranking fourth in the world, after Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand. Almost all rubber is exported, accounting for the second largest share of Ceylon's exports. Sixty percent of this is also owned by British companies.

    Ceylon used to be a regular exporter of rice. However, in order to transform Ceylon into a supplier of rubber raw materials, the British systematically destroyed its farming system and farmers' irrigation canals. As a result, Ceylon cannot produce enough rice each year and relies heavily on imports.

    The Lion Country

    In ancient Chinese Buddhist scriptures, there are records of Ceylon, which was then called Lengjia, Rakshasa Island, or Sengala. Sengala means lion, and Ceylon was also known as the Lion Country. Ceylon is a country with a history of more than two thousand years. It is said that in the fifth century BC, Bengali Prince Vijaya led a group of people from the Ganges River valley in India to Ceylon. Later, Vijaya became the King of Ceylon, and Ceylon began its new historical page. The people of Ceylon had a brilliant culture and art very early on. The underground ancient city of Anuradhapura, excavated thirty years ago, is a relic from two to three thousand years ago, featuring high conical roofs, exquisitely carved floral stones, and delicate shrines in large temples and pagodas.

    Ceylon is a Buddhist country. Currently, nearly 65% of the population of approximately eight and a half million are Buddhists. However, they belong to different ethnic groups, mainly Sinhalese, Tamil, and Moor. Among them, 68% of the residents are Sinhalese, and 11% are Tamil.

    A Page of Painful Past

    In the early sixteenth century, the Portuguese invaded Ceylon. From then on, Ceylon's rich products such as spices and jewels fell into the hands of Portuguese merchants. A century and a half later, the Dutch drove out the Portuguese and became the rulers of Ceylon. Soon, the tentacles of the British East India Company reached into Ceylon. By the early nineteenth century, Ceylon had completely fallen into British hands and became a British colony. Under the long-term exploitation of the British colonialists, the lives of the general people of Ceylon were very impoverished. Ordinary Ceylonese often lived together in small huts made of palm leaves, which were dark, damp, and had no windows or chimneys. The lives of farmers were even more difficult. Ninety percent of farmers in rural areas had no land or only small plots of land. Usury was rampant, and taxes were heavy. Many farmers mortgaged all their harvests before they were even reaped.

    Britain carried out long-term enslavement education in Ceylon, so that Ceylon's own national language and culture did not receive due attention and development, and English became the official language of Ceylon. Currently, Ceylon has only one university.

    Independence in 1948

    After World War II, due to the surge of the Ceylon national liberation movement, Britain was forced to declare Ceylon a dominion in February 1948.

    On the eve of becoming a dominion, Britain forced Ceylon to sign enslaving agreements on national defense, diplomacy, and other matters. After Ceylon's independence, the Governor-General was always a Briton until July 1954, when a Ceylonese was appointed. Even now, Britain still maintains two military bases in Ceylon, Trincomalee and Katunayake.

    The government of Ceylon is a cabinet government. The highest legislative body is a bicameral parliament. The Senate has a total of thirty members, fifteen elected by the House of Representatives and fifteen appointed by the Governor-General. The House of Representatives has a total of one hundred and one members, of which ninety-five are elected and six are appointed by the Governor-General. Both houses are re-elected every five years.

    The highest administrative power in Ceylon belongs to the cabinet, and the Prime Minister is appointed by the Governor-General. The leader of the majority party in the House of Representatives serves as Prime Minister. The current Prime Minister of Ceylon is Bandaranaike, the leader of the People's United Front.

    New Measures of the Bandaranaike Government

    This April, Bandaranaike formed a new government. In terms of domestic and foreign policies, it has taken some measures to safeguard national interests. The new government advocates pursuing a peaceful and neutral foreign policy, not participating in military blocs, and abiding by the resolutions of the Asian-African Conference. The new government has repeatedly announced that it will abolish foreign military bases in Ceylon. The Ceylon government decided to restrict the rebroadcasting of "Voice of America" in Ceylon and investigate the activities of the American intelligence organization "Asia Foundation Committee" in Ceylon. At the same time, it also lifted the ban on the import of progressive books and preventing domestic personnel from visiting socialist countries. Ceylon refused Britain to grant Ceylon citizens imperial titles and announced Sinhala as the national language, replacing the official language left over from the colonial period—English, while protecting the right to use Tamil.

    Realizing the Wish for Friendship

    The people of China and Ceylon have had harmonious and friendly relations since ancient times. After the founding of New China, the friendly relations between the two countries have been further developed. Since 1952, despite the obstruction of the American "embargo," Ceylon has signed trade agreements and contracts with our country four times in succession to sell rubber and purchase rice. Prime Minister Bandaranaike has repeatedly advocated restoring China's legitimate seat in the United Nations. In July of this year, the Ceylon government expressed its willingness to establish diplomatic relations with China. Now, after friendly negotiations between the governments of China and Ceylon, it has been decided to establish diplomatic, economic, and cultural relations. The establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Ceylon is of great significance for consolidating and developing the friendship between the people of China and Ceylon and safeguarding peace in Asia.

    锡兰
    东方的珍珠
    锡兰是印度洋中的一个岛国，隔着三十五公里宽的保克海峡和印度遥遥相对。打开地图来看，它就像从印度南端下垂的一颗美丽的珍珠，因此有“东方珍珠”之称。锡兰从南到北长约四百三十公里，东西宽约二百二十五公里，总面积有六万五千五百八十四平方公里。北部沿海地区多是广阔的平原。西部海岸线较平直，有无数的湖泊连通海湾。中部和南部是山地。山地占全岛面积四分之一。著名的亚当山峰，拔海七千四百英尺，是锡兰的宗教圣地。
    产茶的花园
    锡兰被称为“产茶的花园”。全国茶园面积达五十六万多英亩，产量仅次于中国和印度，居世界第三位。锡兰红茶驰名世界，占锡兰出口的第一位。但是，锡兰80％的茶园为英国公司所控制。其次是橡胶，产量仅次于印度尼西亚、马来亚和泰国，占世界第四位。橡胶差不多全部输出，占锡兰出口的第二位。其中60％也为英国公司所占有。
    锡兰过去是经常输出大米的地方。但英国为了要把锡兰变成橡胶原料的供给地，曾经有系统地破坏它的耕作制度和农民的灌溉水渠。因此，锡兰大米每年都不能自给，绝大部分要依靠输入。
    狮子国
    在我国古代的佛教经典上曾有关于锡兰的记载，当时把锡兰称为楞伽、罗刹岛或僧伽罗。僧伽罗的意思是狮子，锡兰也就称为狮子国。锡兰是有着两千多年悠久历史的国家。据说纪元前五百年孟加拉人尾甲雅率领一批人从印度恒河流域到了锡兰，以后尾甲雅就成了锡兰国王，锡兰开始了自己的新史页。锡兰人民很早就有着光辉灿烂的文化和艺术。三十年前发掘的地下古城——安那德哈普勒，是二三千年前的古迹，里面有高圆锥式的屋顶，雕刻精美的花板石，大庙古塔中的精致神龛。
    锡兰是个佛教国家。现在，在约八百五十多万的人口中，近65％的居民都是佛教徒。但它们属于不同的民族，主要的有僧伽罗族、泰米尔族、摩尔族等。其中68％的居民是僧伽罗人，11％的居民是泰米尔人。
    一页痛苦的往事
    十六世纪初期，葡萄牙人侵入了锡兰。从此锡兰的丰饶物产如香料、珠宝等就落入了葡萄牙商人的手里。一个半世纪以后，荷兰人驱逐了葡萄牙人而为锡兰的统治者。不久，英国东印度公司的触角伸入锡兰。到十九世纪初期，锡兰就完全落入英国手中，成了英国的殖民地。在英国殖民者长期的压榨下，锡兰一般人民的生活非常穷困。普通的锡兰人经常是几家人合住在一间用棕树叶搭成的小屋里，屋内阴暗潮湿，没有窗子，没有烟囱。农民的生活更加困苦，农村中90％的农民无地或仅有小块土地，高利贷盛行，租税又重，许多农民在收割前就把全部收获物抵押光了。
    英国在锡兰进行了长期奴化教育，使锡兰自己的民族语言和文化得不到应有重视和发展，英语成了锡兰官方的正式语言。现在，锡兰仅有一所大学。
    1948年的独立
    第二次世界大战以后，由于锡兰民族解放运动的高涨，英国被迫在1948年2月宣布锡兰为自治领。
    在成为自治领的前夕，英国曾迫使锡兰与英国签订了关于国防、外交等奴役性的协定。锡兰独立后，总督一直是英国人，到1954年7月，才由锡兰人担任。直到现在，英国还在锡兰保有亭可马里和卡冈那雅克两个军事基地。
    锡兰的政府是一个内阁制的政府。最高立法机关是两院制的议会。参议院共有议员三十名，十五名由众议院选出，十五名由总督任命。众议院共有议员一百零一名，其中九十五名由选举产生，六名由总督任命。两院每隔五年改选一次。
    锡兰的最高行政权属于内阁，内阁总理由总督任命。众议院中由多数党的领袖担任。现在锡兰的内阁总理是人民联合阵线的领袖班达拉奈克。
    班达拉奈克政府的新措施
    今年4月，班达拉奈克组成新政府。在对内对外政策方面，采取了一些维护民族利益的措施。新政府主张奉行和平中立的外交政策，不参加军事集团，遵守亚非会议的各项决议。新政府并一再宣布要撤销在锡兰的外国军事基地。锡兰政府决定限制“美国之音”在锡兰的转播，调查美国特务组织“亚洲基金委员会”在锡兰的活动。同时还取消了对进步书刊的入口和阻止本国人士访问社会主义国家的禁令。锡兰拒绝英国再授予锡兰公民以帝国爵位，并宣布以僧加罗语为国语，以代替殖民统治时期遗留下来的官方语言——英语，同时保护使用泰米尔语的权利。
    实现友好的愿望
    中锡两国人民自古就有着融洽的友好关系。新中国成立后，两国的友好关系得到了进一步的发展。自1952年以来，锡兰不顾美国“禁运”的阻挠，接连四次同我国签订了出售橡胶和购买大米的贸易协定和合同。班达拉奈克总理多次主张恢复中国在联合国的合法地位。今年7月，锡兰政府表示愿意同中国建立外交关系。现在，中国和锡兰两国政府经过友好谈判后，已决定建立外交、经济和文化关系。中锡两国建交，对巩固和发展中锡两国人民的友谊和保卫亚洲和平，都有重要意义。　（陈汝厚）
