Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, 10th. The "Burma Route" newspaper in Mandalay stated that "the Burmese government should resolve the border issue with the People's Republic of China in a friendly manner."

The newspaper published an editorial on August 25th, stating that "the demarcation of the Sino-Burmese border issue was handled by Britain during its seventy years of rule over Burma. Now that Burma is independent, the responsibility for negotiating the demarcation falls on the Burmese government."

The editorial said, "If the Burmese side accepts the work left by the British government without review, regarding everything as reasonable regardless of whether it is right or wrong, and negotiates with China with a tough, uncompromising attitude, then Burma will repeat the mistakes made by the British government."

The editorial believes that "the Burmese people must use their own wisdom to judge the work done by the British government. If it is wrong, it should be honestly corrected, and if it is right, it should be bravely upheld. Only in this way can it meet the requirements of truth."

The editorial pointed out that since the British occupied Burma in 1886, disputes had frequently occurred between the Chinese government and the British government along the six-hundred-mile-long Sino-Burmese border. The border agreement signed by Britain with the then-Chinese government in 1941 was not equal and reasonable. "Therefore, we have nothing to object to China's current request for renewed talks to re-determine the border line."

The editorial stated that the people of the Hukawng Valley, located in the triangular area of India, China, Tibet, and Yunnan (an area of fourteen thousand eight hundred square miles), "have customs, habits, and language that are completely the same as the Chinese people." The British have been accused of secretly moving the stone tablets along the border into Chinese territory. The Chinese side believes that Britain stole Chinese territory and incorporated it into Burmese territory. The editorial said, "From this point of view, the Chinese side's view does seem to have some merit."

The editorial also said: Judging from China's current situation, and judging from the situation around China and internationally, the Chinese army will not invade the Union of Burma.

### “缅甸路线报”发表社论指出  中缅边界问题应该友好解决

    “缅甸路线报”发表社论指出
    中缅边界问题应该友好解决
    新华社仰光10日电　曼德勒“缅甸路线报”说，“缅甸政府应该用友好的态度同中华人民共和国解决边界问题”。
    这家报纸在8月25日发表社论说，“缅中边界的划界问题，是由英国在统治缅甸七十年的期间内经手交涉的。现在缅甸独立了，同中国谈判划界的责任就落在缅甸政府的身上了。”
    社论说，“如果缅甸方面把英国政府所留下的工作不经审查，不管是对是错都一律认为合理，并且用强硬的、丝毫不让步的态度向中国交涉，那缅甸就会再犯英国政府所犯过的错误了”。
    社论认为，“缅甸人民必须用自己的智慧来判断英政府所做的工作。如果是错的，就应该老老实实地加以修正，对的，也要勇于坚持。只有这样才能符合真理的要求。”
    社论指出，自1886年英国占领缅甸以后，在六百英里长的中缅边界线上，中国政府与英国政府之间就常发生纠纷。1941年英国同当时的中国政府签订的边界协定并不是平等合理的。“因此，对中国政府现在所提出的重新举行会谈来重新决定边界线的要求，我们是无可厚非的”。
    社论说，位于印度、中国、西藏和云南三角地带的葡萄地区的人民（这个地区的面积是一万四千八百平方英里），“风俗习惯和语言完全同中国人民一样”。英国人曾经被指责偷偷地把边界一带的石碑向中国境内移动。中国方面认为英国是偷取了中国的领土划入在缅甸领界内来的。社论说，“从这一点来看，中国方面的看法，确实似乎也有道理”。
    社论还说：根据中国目前的情况来看，和根据中国四周围以及国际情况来看，中国军队并不会来侵略缅甸联邦。
