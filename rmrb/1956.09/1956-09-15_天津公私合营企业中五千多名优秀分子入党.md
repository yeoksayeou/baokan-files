Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, September 13th. From January to August this year, over 5,600 outstanding individuals from Tianjin's joint public-private industrial and commercial enterprises and handicraft production cooperatives have joined the Chinese Communist Party, and over 360 new Party branches have been established.

The strengthening of the Party's forces has further guaranteed the implementation of the Party's policies and promoted the completion of the work tasks of the joint public-private industrial and commercial enterprises and handicraft production cooperatives. In the early stages of the joint venture of the Third General Sauce and Pickle Factory, the public representatives and workers did not give enough respect to the private personnel's authority, which made some private personnel afraid to take bold responsibility for their work. The Party organization of this factory promptly suggested that the administrative side convene a forum for the private personnel to examine the problems existing in the relationship between the public and private sides in their work together, and conducted education on the Party's united front policy among the workers, which quickly normalized the relationship between the public and private sides. The Party branch of the First Tool and Agricultural Machinery Production Cooperative frequently listened to the opinions of the members on the Party branch and the board of directors, and inspired the enthusiasm of the members. The members put forward many rationalization proposals, which increased production efficiency by about two times. At the same time, they also helped more than 70 members solve their difficulties in life.

    天津公私合营企业中五千多名优秀分子入党
    据新华社天津13日电　天津市公私合营工商企业和手工业生产合作社从今年1月到8月，有五千六百多名优秀分子加入了中国共产党，新建立了三百六十多个党支部。
    随着党的力量的加强，进一步保证了党的方针政策的贯彻执行，推动了公私合营工商企业和手工业生产合作社工作任务的完成。公私合营酱菜第三总厂在合营初期，由于公方代表和职工对私方人员的职权尊重不够，使有些私方人员对工作不敢大胆负责。这个厂的党组织及时建议行政方面召集私方人员开座谈会，检查了公私双方在共事关系上存在的问题，并向职工进行了有关党的统一战线政策的教育，使公私关系很快正常起来。第一工具农械生产合作社党支部，经常听取社员对党支部和理事会的意见，启发社员的积极性；社员们提出很多合理化建议，使生产效率提高了两倍左右。同时还帮助七十多个社员解决了生活上的困难。
