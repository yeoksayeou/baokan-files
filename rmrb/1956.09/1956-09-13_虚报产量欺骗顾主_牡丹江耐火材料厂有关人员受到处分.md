Falsely Reporting Production to Deceive Clients
Relevant Personnel at the Mudanjiang Refractory Materials Factory Disciplined
(Our Report) Recently, the Mudanjiang Municipal Supervisory Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Mudanjiang Municipal People's Committee jointly issued a notice to all enterprises and institutions in the city, exposing the Mudanjiang Refractory Materials Factory's egregious practice of falsely reporting output value and deceiving clients in the execution of the state plan.

In the first quarter, the Mudanjiang Refractory Materials Factory only completed 92.14% of its output value plan, but falsely reported to the higher authorities that it had completed 107.1% of the output value plan. They reported raw materials as being in storage when they had not yet entered the production process, or when the production process had not yet been completed, reporting them as in storage as semi-finished products. For example, in March of this year, they falsely reported 560 tons of clay fire mud as being in storage. Of the 325.28 tons of clay fire mud reported as completed output value and in storage at the end of the first quarter, none had actually been produced. In addition, they estimated the output value of products that had not yet left the kiln, or had left the kiln but had not yet been selected. They even included the statistical figures of contracts that had not yet been put into production in the output value.

This factory also deceived fraternal factories and mines by passing off substandard products as good ones. Driven by the bourgeois profit-seeking viewpoint of making more profit, Deputy Factory Director Qu Baorui instructed that the 700,000 tiles sold to the Hegang Mining Bureau should be delivered without careful selection. Of the 310,000 tiles delivered, 71.4% did not meet the quality requirements, and some were even waste products. During the delivery, the Hegang Mining Bureau had already telegraphed the factory that the quality of the pottery tiles did not meet the contract requirements and refused to accept them, but Deputy Factory Director Wang Enfu believed that if the contract expired, the penalty for the railway car would be the same either way, so he insisted on sending another 30,000 tiles.

In order to expand sales and earn more profits, this factory also fabricated false laboratory reports. The thermal conductivity of the heat-insulating bricks trial-produced by the factory, as tested by the Dalian Kiln Industry Laboratory, was 0.6169 kilocalories, while the thermal conductivity of heat-insulating bricks generally required by construction units does not exceed 0.12 to 0.25 kilocalories.

The erroneous behavior of the leading cadres of this factory in deceiving the higher authorities and fraternal factories and mines not only had a very bad impact on the enterprise, but also brought undue losses to the state. The Mudanjiang Municipal Supervisory Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Mudanjiang Municipal People's Committee gave Deputy Factory Directors Wang Enfu and Qu Baorui, Party Branch Secretary Diao Jiayun, Acting Planning Section Chief Wu Jun, and Technical Section Chief Yuan Yuntao disciplinary actions of demerit and warning, respectively.

The notice pointed out that similar deceptive behaviors to that of the Refractory Materials Factory also exist in other factories in the city, but only in different forms of expression. The Mudanjiang Food Factory has adopted the method of "underreporting excess" or using empty checks to make up for next month's plan to achieve "balanced completion of tasks"; the Leather Factory uses "transferring from inventory" to repeatedly calculate output value to achieve "balanced completion of tasks" every month; the First Rubber Factory, Particleboard Factory, Agricultural Implement Factory, etc., send out incomplete products and bad products to deceive clients. This egregious behavior of deceiving the Party and the country must be thoroughly eradicated.

### 虚报产量欺骗顾主  牡丹江耐火材料厂有关人员受到处分

    虚报产量欺骗顾主
    牡丹江耐火材料厂有关人员受到处分
    本报讯　最近中共牡丹江市监察委员会及牡丹江市人民委员会联合向全市各企业和事业单位通报，揭发牡丹江耐火材料厂在执行国家计划中，采取虚报产值、欺骗顾主的恶劣手段。
    牡丹江耐火材料厂第一季度只完成了产值计划的92.14％，却向上级虚报完成产值计划107.1％。他们当原料尚未进入生产过程，或是生产过程尚未结束，在半成品的时候就报入库。如今年3月就这样假报入库粘土火泥五百六十吨。在第一季度末上报完成产值而入库的三百二十五点二八吨粘土火泥根本没有生产。另外，在产品未出窑或虽已出窑尚未进行挑选的时候，就先行预计产值。甚至把没有投入生产的合同统计数字也算入产值。
    这个厂还以次品充好品欺骗兄弟厂矿。在多赚利润的资产阶级营利观点支配下，副厂长曲宝瑞指示将卖给鹤岗矿务局的七十万块瓦不经精选就交货，在交出的三十一万块瓦中，就有71.4％不符合质量要求，甚至有废品。交货当中，鹤岗矿务局已电告该厂陶瓦质量不符合同规定，拒绝验收，但副厂长王恩富认为若合同到期，车皮罚款，里外一样，坚持又发出了三万块。
    这个厂为了扩大销路，赚取更多利润，还制造了假化验单。这个厂试制的绝热砖经大连窑业化验室的化验，导热率是零点六一六九千卡，而一般建筑单位需要的绝热砖导热率不超过零点一二至零点二五千卡。
    这个厂领导干部欺骗上级和兄弟厂矿的错误行为，不但在企业中造成了极坏影响，而且给国家带来了不应有的损失。中共牡丹江市监察委员会及牡丹江市人民委员会对这个厂副厂长王恩富、曲宝瑞，党总支书记刁家运、代理计划股长武俊及技术股长原云涛等人，分别给予记过和警告处分。
    通报中指出：类似耐火材料厂的欺骗行为，在市内其他工厂也存在着，只不过是表现形式不同。牡丹江食品工厂曾采取“少报超额”或用空头支票弥补下月计划的办法，求得“均衡完成任务”；皮革厂以“拨库”重复计算产值来求得月月“均衡完成任务”；第一橡胶厂、刨花板厂、农具厂等将不完整的产品及坏产品发出去欺骗顾主。这种欺骗党与国家的恶劣行为，必须彻底肃清。
