    Rambling Through the Book Forest
    Wang Shimao's "Xue Pu Za Shu"
    Xidi

    This is a book that honestly discusses growing flowers and planting fruits. Everything is approachable and practical, without any bizarre or shocking arguments or methods. The book consists of three volumes. The first volume is "Flower Treatise," the second volume is "Fruit Treatise," "Vegetable Treatise" (with aquatic plants), "Melon Treatise," "Bean Treatise," and "Bamboo Treatise." The third volume is a supplement, which not only supplements what was not covered in the first and second volumes, but also includes several excerpts from Shen Maoguan's "Hua Yi Hua Mu Kao" that he himself did not mention. What we fear most are books that are repeatedly copied and follow the same old patterns. Good books, however, are those in which every word comes from the author's own experience; they are not only first-hand materials but also first-class writing. Shimao's book deserves such praise. He casually records his own experiences in planting flowers and fruits, without quoting a single word from his predecessors. It is indeed a useful and good book. In terms of prose, it seems plain but is actually rich, seems shallow but is actually profound, and can also be ranked among the best Ming Dynasty writings. The "Bao Yan Tang Secret Collection" once included this book, but it only had one volume, which was a combination of the original first and second volumes. It begins with Shimao's preface written in the Dinghai year of the Wanli era (1587 AD). Shimao was Shiyuan's younger brother and admired Shiyuan's views on art. However, the "Siku Quanshu" abstract praised him greatly because it contained disagreements with Wang and Li's views. Therefore, only the "Yi Pu Xie Yu" was included in the "Siku Quanshu," while the rest of his books, such as "Xue Pu Za Shu," were listed in the "Cun Mu." My copy of "Xue Pu Za Shu" is in the "Wang Fengchang Za Zhu." The "Za Zhu" volume has the "Hanlin Academy" seal in front, which should be the one used by the "court officials" at that time.

    漫步书林
    王世懋：学圃杂疏
    西谛
    这是一部老老实实地讲究种花植果的书。一切平易近人，可以见之实用，没有怪诞可惊的议论与方法。此书凡三卷，第一卷是“花疏，”第二卷是“果疏”、“蔬疏”（附水草）“瓜疏”、“豆疏”及“竹疏”，第三卷为拾遗，除补第一、二卷所未及者外，并附录慎懋官的“华夷花木考”里的若干则，那些是他自己所未曾述及的。我们最怕的是辗转抄袭，陈陈相因的书。好的书却是语语从自己经验中来的，不仅是第一手的材料，也是第一流的文章。像世懋这部书可以当得起这样的好评了。他随笔札记自己的种植花果的经验，不抄掇前人的只字片语，的确是一部有用的好书。就散文而论，似淡而实浓郁，似浅而实深厚，也可列入明文的上乘。“宝颜堂秘笈”曾收入此书，却只有一卷，是把原书的第一、二卷合并为一的。首有万历丁亥（公元一五八七年）世懋的序。世懋为世员弟，谈艺多崇慕世员语。但四库提要以其间有不赞同王、李语，便大加赞许，所以只有那部“艺圃撷余”是收入“四库”的，其余的像“学圃杂疏”等书，就都被列于存目里了。我这部“学圃杂疏”是在“王奉常杂著”里的。“杂著”卷前有“翰林院”印，当即是当时“馆臣”所用的那一部了。
