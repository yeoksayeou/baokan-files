    Regarding the International Conference Proposed by Egypt
    Spain Expresses Willingness to Participate
    Xinhua News Agency, September 14th -- Madrid Dispatch: The Spanish Falange's newspaper, "Arriba," stated on the 13th that Spain will participate in another international conference on the Suez Canal issue proposed by Egyptian President Nasser.
    The newspaper also criticized the attitude of Britain and France on the Suez Canal issue. It said that Britain and France "do not seem to be motivated by a desire to solve the problem, but rather to take advantage of the problem caused by Egypt's nationalization of the Suez Canal Company to try to... revise their policy direction towards the Mediterranean and North Africa."

    对埃及建议举行的国际会议
    西班牙表示愿意参加
    新华社14日讯　马德里消息：西班牙长枪党的机关报“阿里巴报”在13日表示，西班牙将参加埃及总统纳赛尔建议举行的关于苏彝士运河问题的另一次国际会议。
    这家报纸还指责英法两国在苏彝士运河问题上的态度。它说，英法两国“似乎不是出于要解决问题的愿望，而是要利用埃及把苏彝士运河公司收归国有这件事所引起的问题来设法……改订它们对地中海和北非的政策方针”。
