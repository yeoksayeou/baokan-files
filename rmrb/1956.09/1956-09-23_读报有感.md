    Thoughts on Reading the Newspaper
    "The Principle of Sea and Air"
    Lin Mu
    Bernard Shaw said, "The Englishman may do good or do evil, but you will never find him doing anything wrong. He has a principle for everything he does. He hits you according to the principle of patriotism; he loots you according to the principle of commerce; he enslaves you according to the principle of empire."
    Shaw has indeed studied the Englishman thoroughly. If you don't believe it, please take a look at British Sir Anthony Eden.
    The Egyptian government announced the nationalization of the Suez Canal, which was originally a matter of course, but unexpectedly, it attracted a scolding from Sir Anthony Eden. Eden scolded Nasser for being "unreasonable," saying that although the Suez Canal is in Egypt, it is a British major artery growing in Egypt. Therefore, he threatened: "The only way to deal with the current situation is for the British army to reoccupy the Suez region."
    People may say: This time British Sir Anthony Eden must be wrong! No, don't jump to conclusions, he is not wrong, he still has principles, that is the "principle of sea and air" (Nasser's words).
    In light of this, we know that Shaw's words are not false.
    Where is Justice?

    Before the Suez Canal was dug, who ever said that the sovereignty of this land did not belong to Egypt?
    After the canal was dug, what reason is there to say that the sovereignty of this land does not belong to Egypt?
    Is it because Egypt sacrificed 120,000 people to dig this canal and made a mistake? Was it dug badly?
    Or is it because it opened up this canal, making it convenient for the United States, Britain, and France, which own a large number of ships, to navigate and therefore is guilty?
    Pitiable! Hateful! The United States, Britain, and France are so upside down that they can't thank the Egyptian people enough, but they repay kindness with revenge and insist on claiming Egypt's things as their own.
    If a canal is dug from New York to San Francisco, and many people are sacrificed, and it also facilitates the shipping of many countries, does any country have the right to propose "international control"?
    Sophistical colonial countries of the United States, Britain, and France, tell us, where is the justice in your proposed "international control" for the owner of the Suez Canal?

    “海空的原则”
    林木
    萧伯纳说：“英国人可能干好事，也可能干坏事，可是你总不会发现他干了什么错事。他干什么全有一套原则。他打你，是根据爱国的原则；他掠夺你，是根据商业的原则；他奴役你，是根据帝国的原则。”
    萧翁毕竟把英国人研究到家了，不信，请看看英国的艾登爵士吧。
    埃及政府宣布苏伊士运河收归国有，这本来是天经地义的事情，但没有想到，却招来了艾登爵士的一顿恫吓。艾登骂纳赛尔“不讲理”，说苏伊士运河虽然在埃及，但是，它却是长在埃及的一条英国大动脉。因此，他扬言曰：“为今之计，只有英军重新占领苏伊士区。”
    人们也许会说：这回英国人艾登爵士可错了吧！不，你慢点下结论，他可没有错，他还是有原则的，那就是“海空的原则”（纳赛尔语）
    征之于此，方知萧翁言之不谬也。
    公道在哪里？

    在没有开凿苏伊士运河以前，有谁说过这片土地的主权不是埃及的呢？
    在开凿了运河以后，又有什么理由能说这片土地的主权不是埃及的呢？
    是因为埃及牺牲了十二万人开凿这条运河牺牲得错了吗？开凿得坏了吗？
    还是因为它开通了这条运河，使拥有大量船只的美、英、法三国有航行之便因而有罪了吗？
    可怜！可恨！美、英、法三国竟是这般颠倒，感激埃及人民还来不及，却还恩当仇报，硬要把埃及的东西说成自己的。
    如果开一条从纽约到旧金山的运河，也牺牲了很多人，也便利了许多国家的航运，是否有那个国家因此有权利提出“国际管制”的主张？
    强词夺理的美、英、法殖民国家，你们说，你们提的“国际管制”的建议，对苏伊士运河主人的公道在哪里？
