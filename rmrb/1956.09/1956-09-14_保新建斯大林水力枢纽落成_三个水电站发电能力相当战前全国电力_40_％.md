Xinhua News Agency, September 13th: According to the Bulgarian Telegraph Agency, the newly built Stalin Hydroelectric Hub near Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria, held its completion ceremony a few days ago.

This massive hydraulic project located on the Iskar River, east of the capital, includes a reservoir, two dams, three hydroelectric power stations, two main irrigation canals, and many branch canals.

The reservoir of the hydroelectric hub is fifteen kilometers long and six kilometers wide. It has a water storage capacity of 670 million cubic meters and an annual water flow of 340 million cubic meters. This amount of water is sufficient to drive the water turbines of three hydroelectric power stations, enabling them to generate electricity equivalent to 40% of the nation's total generating capacity in 1939, before the war.

The irrigation canals of the hydroelectric hub will guarantee irrigation for more than 500,000 decares (each decare equals one and a half Chinese mu) of arable land, transforming the Sofia Plain into a rich grain and feed region. The area of orchards will also increase tenfold.

    保新建斯大林水力枢纽落成
    三个水电站发电能力相当战前全国电力40％
    据新华社13日讯　据保加利亚通讯社报道：保加利亚首都索非亚附近新建的斯大林水力枢纽在几天以前举行了落成典礼。
    这个位于首都东部伊斯基尔河上的巨大水力工程包括有一个水库、两条堤坝、三个水电站、两条灌溉干渠和许多支渠。
    水力枢纽的水库长达十五公里，宽达六公里。它的蓄水量是六亿七千万立方公尺，每年流水量是三亿四千万立方公尺，这些水量足够发动三个水电站的水轮机，从而使它们发出相当于战前1939年的全国发电能力的40％的电力。
    水力枢纽的灌溉渠将保证灌溉五十多万狄卡尔（每狄卡尔合一市亩半）耕地，使索非亚平原变成一个丰富的谷物饲料地区。果园面积也将增加到十倍。
