Don't Overcorrect When Promoting Cadres
	Feng Jun
	This spring, Jiangsu Province vigorously criticized right-leaning conservative thinking in the promotion and use of cadres, repeatedly emphasizing the need to boldly and extensively promote cadres with "both ability and integrity" to leadership positions. This was entirely correct. Because with the development of the country's socialist construction, all areas need a large number of excellent cadres, and after years of cultivation and practical training by the Party, many excellent cadres have indeed emerged in all areas. These cadres should have been promoted, but in many places, they were blocked by the conservative idea of ​​"counting qualifications and seniority." After criticism, the work of promoting cadres in various places in Jiangsu Province has achieved great results. However, some places have overcorrected, thinking that opposing conservatism means promoting cadres more and faster, regardless of needs and possibilities, and blindly pursuing quantity. Some places, fearing being labeled as right-leaning conservative, promoted cadres who should not have been promoted. The promotion quotas in many places are not determined according to needs, but according to the size of the establishment: for an establishment of three people, one or two leading cadres are assigned; for an establishment of five people, one or three are assigned; for an establishment of seven to ten people, one or four are assigned... The Production Cooperation Department of the Zhenjiang Prefectural Committee, with an establishment of fifteen people, has six ministers, eight section chiefs, and one secretary after the promotions. The Organization Department of the Zhenjiang Prefectural Committee, with an establishment of fourteen people, has four ministers, nine section chiefs, and one clerk after the promotions. The Nanjing Department Store has twelve managers, and the Nanjing Vegetable Company has eight managers. It is no wonder that the masses say: Now we are opening "manager companies." The Taixian People's Bank has nine presidents, the Baoying County People's Bank has seven presidents, and the supply and marketing cooperative has eight directors; the Sisui District Committee of Baoying County has seven district committee secretaries. As a result, because the superiors stipulated that the district committee should have five standing committee members, two district committee secretaries could not attend the district committee standing committee meeting, which is really strange. The Nantong Pharmaceutical Company has a total of forty-two cadres, with three managers and seven section chiefs already, and plans to promote four managers and seventeen section chiefs (this plan was not approved); if this were done, it would inevitably be three leading cadres leading one general cadre, which is truly "vigorous leadership."

	What are the results of such "vigorous leadership"? It is not seen to be good. For example, in a section of the Zhenjiang Prefectural Committee, four people have three section chiefs. When dealing with drafts, the section chief dare not change the drafts drafted by the deputy section chief, let alone ask the deputy section chief to copy things; and the deputy section chief feels that revising the section chief's drafts is even more inappropriate, so they push and defer to each other, and dare not make decisions. This situation also exists in other units with "more officials than soldiers." However, this does not mean that we have promoted too many cadres, but that some places do not promote cadres based on actual conditions and according to needs and possibilities. Look, even in Baoying County, where one district has seven district committee secretaries, eight of the ten districts do not have directors of the Handicraft Industry Union!

	I think the organizational structure of an institution is similar to the human body structure: the head should be like the head, and the limbs should be like the limbs. An abnormality becomes a strange phenomenon, becomes an unhealthy person, and will have more disadvantages than advantages.

    提拔干部不要矫枉过正
    冯俊
    今年春天，江苏省各个地方曾经大力批判过在提拔和使用干部上的右倾保守思想，一再强调要大胆大量地提拔“德才兼备”的干部到领导岗位上来，这是完全正确的。因为随着国家社会主义建设事业的发展，各方面都需要大批的优秀干部，而经过数年来党的培养与实际锻炼，各方面也确实涌现出许多优秀干部。这些干部本来是应该提拔起来的，但许多地方都给“数资格，论辈数”的保守思想堵住了。经过批判以后，江苏省各个地方提拔干部的工作都取得了很大的成绩。但有些地方又矫枉过了正，以为要反保守就是提拔干部愈多愈快愈好，不顾需要与可能，盲目追求数量。有的地方怕被说成是右倾保守，把不应提拔的干部也提拔起来。许多地方提拔干部的指标不是按需要，而是按编制多少确定的：凡编制三人，领导干部配一职两人；编制五人则一职三人；编制七至十人则一职四人……。镇江地委生产合作部，编制十五人，提拔后是六个部长、八个科长、一个秘书，镇江地委组织部编制十四人，提拔后是四个部长、九个科长、一个干事。南京市百货公司有十二个经理，南京蔬菜公司有八个经理。难怪群众说：现在开的是“经理公司”了。泰县人民银行有九个行长，宝应县人民银行有七个行长，供销社有八个主任；宝应县汜水区委有七个区委书记，结果因为上级规定区委是五个常委，因而有两个区委书记反而不能参加区委常委会，真是奇事。南通市医药公司总共四十二个干部，已有三个经理、七个股长，还打算提拔四个经理、十七个股长（这个计划未批准）；如果照这样做的话，那势必是三个领导干部领导一个一般干部，实在是名副其实的“大力领导”了。
    这样“大力领导”的结果怎样呢！却并不见佳。像镇江地委有个科，四个人有三个科长，处理文稿时，科长不敢改副科长起草的文稿，更不敢叫副科长抄写东西了；而副科长感到改科长的稿子更不适合，于是你推他让，不敢决定。这种情况，在别的“官多兵少”的单位，也同样存在。但是，这并不是说我们提拔干部提拔得太多了，而是说一些地方不根据实际情况，不根据需要与可能来提拔干部，你看，就在有一个区配了七个区委书记的宝应县，十个区中还有八个区手工业联合社没有主任哩！
    我想，机关的组织机构也和人体结构差不多：脑袋要像脑袋，四肢要像四肢，反常就成为怪现象，就成了不健康的人，就会有弊无利。
