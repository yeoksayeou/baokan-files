	It's Not Too Late

	To negotiate or to wage war? This is the question the United States, Britain, and France must answer to the world today regarding the Suez Canal issue.

	After the London conference, the attitudes of Egypt and the United States, Britain, and France stand in stark contrast. Egypt is calm and confident. It is resolute in firmly safeguarding its sovereignty, while being understanding and conciliatory in ensuring the freedom of navigation through the canal. Egypt has consistently maintained the smooth passage of the canal, and no one has complained about the canal's traffic. Egypt is also willing to meet with the so-called "Five-Nation Committee" organized by Western countries, even though the committee's task is to "explain" the "Dulles Plan" to Egypt, which Egypt cannot agree to.

	In contrast to Egypt's attitude, the United States, Britain, and France are aggressively exerting pressure on Egypt from all sides, attempting to force Egypt to accept the "Dulles Plan," which blatantly infringes upon Egyptian sovereignty.

	Various signs indicate that the United States, Britain, and France are acting like a symphony orchestra in exerting pressure on Egypt, with a clear division of labor. Britain and France emphasize military threats. They have deployed some military forces, scraped together with great difficulty from home and abroad, to the Mediterranean region, posing as if they are ready to use force at any time. The United States, while secretly supporting Britain and France's military threats, verbally emphasizes its "determination to resolve the issue peacefully." And the United States' so-called "peaceful means," according to Dulles and Eisenhower, is to "internationalize" the canal. They are playing a double game, one singing the red face and the other the white face, trying to force Egypt into the trap set by the United States through this combination of soft deception and hard coercion.

	However, the United States, Britain, and France's performance is not successful. Egypt is determined to resist any military threat from Britain and France and is unwilling to be fooled by the United States. The Egyptian government, based on the 1888 Constantinople Convention, refuted Dulles and Eisenhower's claim that the Suez Canal had long been "internationalized." Eisenhower then came out to argue that Egypt "misunderstood the U.S. position." According to him, the United States believes that the Suez Canal has an international nature in terms of its use, not in terms of ownership. However, those who know the "Dulles Plan" and Dulles's remarks at the August 28th press conference can see that the United States' trick lies precisely here. The United States wants to avoid the principled terms of "internationalization" and "sovereignty" and use "specific and practical terms" regarding the "use" of the canal, so that Egypt's ownership of the canal becomes an empty phrase through the internationalization of the canal's use.

	Now, the United States, Britain, and France are planning to use military threats as a backing to make the so-called "Five-Nation Committee's" "explanation" of the "Dulles Plan" to Egypt take on the nature of submitting an ultimatum. The British "Daily Herald" revealed that within the British government and Conservative Party members, there is "very serious" talk about "Menzies's mission not being the prelude to negotiations, but the prelude to launching a war against Egypt." At the same time, the United States, Britain, and France are instigating non-Egyptian pilots of the Suez Canal to resign, creating difficulties for the canal's navigation in order to occupy the canal under the pretext of maintaining navigation. There are also signs that the United States, Britain, and France intend to use special agents they have dispatched to create incidents in Cairo or elsewhere, so that they can carry out armed intervention under the guise of protecting expatriates.

	However, the clever and brave Egyptian people are not lambs to be slaughtered, and they are taking various countermeasures to deal with these tricks of the United States, Britain, and France. The Egyptian government has been widely recruiting pilots in various countries to thwart the United States, Britain, and France's plot to paralyze the canal's navigation. They are also highly vigilant against the sabotage activities of foreign special agents. If the United States, Britain, and France dare to launch an attack on Egypt, then even though the Egyptian people are peace-loving people, the weapons in their hands will never spare any aggressor.

	The British and French governments should now calmly think about what their war threats mean to them now. Can their economic and military strength withstand maintaining a long-term war threat? Not to mention a protracted war. To discerning people, the fact that Britain and France are currently using force and trying to solve the problem immediately with such urgency is precisely because they do not have the strength to maintain the current state of mobilization for a long time. Moreover, within their own countries, the voices against the use of force have been rising with the development of the situation. Especially for Britain, it cannot but consider what changes will occur in its relations with Asian and African countries once it attacks Egypt, and what impact its third economic power plan will have. In the end, when Britain has further weakened its own strength by futilely interfering in Egypt, it will find that the question before it is: For whom is Britain fighting?

	Due to emotionalism and a lack of a calm and conciliatory spirit on the Suez Canal issue, Britain's prestige has greatly declined throughout the world, especially in the Asian and African regions. If Britain does not pull back from the brink and continues to blindly believe in force, its prestige and influence will plummet beyond recovery. To maintain its prestige and interests, Britain has only to immediately stop the military threat and conduct negotiations with Egypt in a peaceful and consultative manner. This is the only correct and realistic path before Britain.

	Whether it's soft deception or reckless action, it will be of no avail to an Egypt that has already become independent. If the United States, Britain, and France stubbornly refuse to change their attitude, they will gain nothing except the strong opposition of Egypt and the people of the world. Now the door to negotiations on the Suez Canal issue is still open, and it is not too late for Britain, which is the most enthusiastic about using force, to change its attitude.

    为时未晚
    要谈判呢？还是要战争？这是今天美、英、法三国在苏彝士运河问题上必须向全世界回答的问题。
    在伦敦会议以后，埃及的态度和美、英、法的态度是一个显明的对照。埃及是冷静而且自信的。它在坚决维护自己的主权方面是坚定的，同时在保证运河通航自由的问题上是通情达理而富于和解精神的。埃及始终保持着运河的顺畅通航，没有任何人对运河通航的情况有过怨言。埃及也愿意接见西方国家所组织的所谓“五国委员会”，虽然这个委员会的任务是向埃及“解释”埃及所不能同意的“杜勒斯计划”。
    和埃及的态度相反，美、英、法三国却在气势汹汹地从各方面对埃及施加压力，企图迫使埃及接受露骨地侵犯埃及主权的“杜勒斯计划”。
    种种迹象表明，美、英、法三国在对埃及施加压力方面，像一个交响乐队一样，显然作了一定的分工。英、法偏重在武力威胁。它们把从国内外好不容易搜集来的一些兵力，投到地中海地区去，做出随时准备动武的姿态。美国一方面暗中支持英、法的武力威胁，一方面却在口头上大谈其“决心用和平方式”解决问题。而美国的所谓“和平方式”，用杜勒斯和艾森豪威尔的话来说，就是使运河“国际化”。它们就是这样一个唱红脸，一个唱白脸，想用这种软骗硬逼的办法，迫使埃及走进美国布置的圈套里去。
    但是美、英、法三国这出戏唱得并不成功。埃及决心抵抗英、法的任何武力威胁，也不愿意上美国的当。埃及政府根据1888年君士坦丁堡公约，驳斥了杜勒斯和艾森豪威尔的所谓苏彝士运河早已“国际化”的说法。艾森豪威尔接着就出来辩解说：埃及“误会了美国的立场”。据他说，美国认为，苏彝士运河在用途方面而不是在所有权方面具有国际性质。但是，知道“杜勒斯计划”和杜勒斯在8月28日记者招待会上的谈话的人，都可以看出，美国的诡计正是在这里。美国是想避开“国际”、“主权”这些原则性的字眼，而用关于运河的“使用”的“具体、实际的字眼”，通过对运河使用的国际化，来使埃及对运河的所有权成为一句空话。
    现在，美、英、法正在打算以武力威胁为后盾，使得所谓“五国委员会”向埃及“解释”“杜勒斯计划”，具有提交最后通牒的性质。英国“每日先驱报”透露说，在英国政府和保守党人士中间，正在“非常认真地”谈论到“孟席斯的出使不成为谈判的前奏，而成为对埃及发动战争的前奏”。同时，美、英、法正在策动苏彝士运河的非埃及籍的领航员离职，给运河通航制造困难，以便在维持航运的借口下占领运河。也有迹象表明，美、英、法打算利用它们派遣的特务间谍，在开罗或其他地方制造事件，这样它们就可以在保护侨民的招牌下实行武装干涉。
    但是，聪明而勇敢的埃及人民并不是引颈待戮的羔羊，他们正在采取各种对策来对付美、英、法的这些诡计。埃及政府已经在各国广泛招募领航员，来挫败美、英、法瘫痪运河航运的阴谋。他们对于外国特务间谍的破坏活动，也有着高度的警惕。如果美、英、法竟敢对埃及发动进攻，那末纵然埃及人民是爱好和平的人民，他们手里的武器却决不会饶恕任何一个侵略者的。
    英、法两国政府现在应该冷静地想一想，现在它们的战争威胁对它们意味着什么。它们的经济力量和军事力量经得起保持长时期的战争威胁吗？更不用说一次旷日持久的战争了。对于明眼人来说，英、法目前动用武力，急如星火地企图立即解决问题，正是因为它们没有力量长期维持目前的动员状态。而且在它们国内，反对使用武力的呼声，已经随着局势的发展而日益高涨。特别对于英国来说，它不能不考虑到一旦进攻埃及以后，它同亚非国家的关系将发生怎样的变化，它的第三种经济力量的计划将受到怎样的影响。到头来，当英国因为徒劳无功地干涉埃及而进一步削弱了自己的力量以后，它将发现放在它面前的是这样的一个问题：英国究竟为谁而战？
    由于在苏彝士运河问题上感情用事，缺乏冷静而和解的精神，英国的威信在全世界、特别是在亚非地区已经大大低落。如果英国还不悬崖勒马，而继续迷信武力，它的威信和影响将要一落千丈，不可收拾。英国要保持自己的威信和利益，只有立即停止武力威胁，用和平协商的态度同埃及进行谈判。这是摆在英国面前的唯一正确和现实的道路。
    软骗也好，蛮干也好，对一个已经独立了的埃及来说，都是无济于事的。美、英、法三国如果硬不改变它们的态度，除了遭受埃及和全世界人民的强烈反对以外，是什么东西都得不到的。现在苏彝士运河问题的谈判之门还是开着，在使用武力问题上最起劲的英国，要改变它的态度，还为时未晚。
