    The Beijing Peking Opera Troupe Four, led by Wu Suqiu and Jiang Tielin, has recently begun a long-term collaborative performance arrangement with the Xi Xiaobo Peking Opera Troupe.
    The purpose of their collaboration is to enrich the repertoire and improve the quality of performances. For a long time, these two troupes have suffered from a shortage of principal actors, resulting in a limited number of frequently performed plays, which has failed to meet the audience's demands. Audiences have criticized this phenomenon as "a single peony stem." The augmented lineup of Peking Opera Troupe Four will enable it to revive some traditional plays that were popular in the past. Recently, Peking Opera Troupe Four is preparing to stage and rehearse several old plays that have not been performed for a long time, including "Xunyang Tower," "The Dragon and the Phoenix," "Zhuliang Village," "Fenhe Bay," "Famen Temple," and "Su Wu Herding Sheep." In addition, Xi Xiaobo is preparing to revise the complete "Qu Yuan," Wu Suqiu is preparing to revise the complete "Zhuo Wenjun," and perform several new plays she recently learned from the veteran artist Xiao Cuihua.

    奚啸伯、吴素秋长期合作演出
    本报讯　吴素秋、姜铁麟领导的北京市京剧四团，最近起和奚啸伯京剧团长期合作演出。
    他们合作演出的目的，是为了丰富上演剧目，提高演出质量。长期以来，这两个剧团因为主要演员不齐，经常上演的剧目很少，不能满足观众的要求。观众批评这种现象为“光杆牡丹”。增强阵容以后的京剧四团，就有可能来整理一些过去受到观众欢迎的传统剧目。最近京剧四团将要公演以及正在排练的久未上演的老戏有“浔阳楼”、“游龙戏凤”、“珠帘寨”、“汾河湾”、“法门寺”、“苏武牧羊”等，此外，奚啸伯准备整理全本“屈原”，吴素秋准备整理全本“卓文君”和演出她最近向老艺人筱翠花学习的几出新戏。
