    Talking about Tiger-Fighting
    Liu Jia
    The newspapers have carried several news items about tiger-fighting: some tiger-fighters are strong men, some are female students, and some are elderly people in their sixties. Reading these news items, one cannot help but think of Wu Song, and one cannot help but compare the Wu Song of the past with today's female students and "sixty-one-year-old men."
    The tiger, known as the king of beasts, is fearsome. This is not because it is big and fierce, but because it eats people. In the zoo, people find it interesting to see this big, spotted creature in a cage, baring its teeth, waving its tail, and roaring, and they gesticulate and talk and laugh. But if you encounter this tiger with its glaring eyes and striped forehead in the deep mountains and wild swamps? I'm afraid few would not change color. Precisely because of this, when people mention "Wu Song, the tiger-fighter," they cannot help but feel respect.
    Wu Song is a tiger-fighting hero, but his fearlessness of tigers is slightly inferior to that of today's female student Wang Yuan'ai. When Wu Song saw the tiger, he was so frightened that he woke up from his drunken stupor, and only under the threat of death from the tiger did he display his extraordinary martial arts skills to fight the tiger. Wang Yuan'ai is different. She is just a seventeen-year-old girl, and apart from Wu Song's martial arts skills, she doesn't even have the strength of an ordinary person. The tiger didn't threaten her either, but when she heard the crying of a child outside the door and saw the tiger walking away with the child in its mouth, she "immediately rushed out the door" and "chased after the tiger." When "the tiger suddenly dropped the child, turned its head, and bared its teeth and claws" to roar at her in a show of force, she "dashed forward bravely to rescue the child." When the tiger grabbed the child and walked away again, she didn't just chase, but "picked up two stones and ran to the road, overtaking the tiger" and blocking its path. When Wang Yuan'ai fell, and the tiger dropped the child again, this should be said to be a moment of extreme danger, but she "got up from the ground and rushed forward, holding the seriously injured child tightly in her arms." At this time, she was "exhausted," sitting on the ground with the child in her arms, "she looked at the tiger, and the tiger looked at her." In this situation of tense stalemate, the degree of tension and danger, in the words of the commentator, was "beyond compare." But at this time, Wang Yuan'ai's mental state was not one of fear, terror, or hesitation, but "very excited" because she had rescued the child. She dared to chase the tiger to save a child, and was still "very excited" in the face of extreme danger, because she had rescued the child. Beyond that, she put everything else out of her mind, never considering her own personal interests, and never showing the slightest fear. This is a noble heroic quality. This simple heroic nature is something that Wu Song could not have matched in his day!
    Some people will say that this is "a young calf not afraid of tigers," so how can we explain the "sixty-one-year-old man" fighting a tiger with his bare hands? Only with a great heart that loves the people more than one's own life can one become a truly fearless hero. In our country, there are many ordinary people with such great hearts. Luo Shengjiao, who sacrificed himself to save others, Huang Jiguang and Dong Cunrui, who sacrificed their lives in battle to save the lives of more people, and those who blocked breaches with their bodies and protected dikes in rescue efforts, don't they all have a great heart like Wang Yuan'ai? A great heart does not discriminate between the bodies of men, women, old, and young. All these people deserve our respect, and all deserve our study.

    谈打虎
    刘甲
    报纸上出现了几次打虎的消息：打虎者有的是壮汉，有的是女学生，也有的是年届花甲的老人。读了这些消息，使人不由地联想起武松来，不由地又要拿往日的武松和今日的女学生、“六一老人”等作番比较。
    号称众兽之王的老虎是可怕的。这不因它大而猛，而是它要吃人。在动物园里，人们看到关在笼子里的这个花皮大物，张牙舞爪，摆尾咆哮时会觉得有趣，而指手画脚谈笑风生。但如果是在深山野泽，碰到这只吊睛白额斑烂大虫呢？恐怕就少有不变颜失色的了。正因为如此，所以人们一提起“打虎武松”来，就不免要油然起敬。
    武松是打虎的英雄，但他的不怕虎较之今天女学生王圆爱的不怕虎却要略逊一筹。当武松看到虎时是连酒都吓醒了，在猛虎以死相逼之下，方施展超群的武艺同虎搏斗的。王圆爱不同。她只是一个十七岁的小姑娘，别说武松的武艺，就连普通人的力气，她也是不足的。老虎也没有来逼她，而是当她听到门外小孩哭声和看到老虎口衔小孩而走的时候，“立刻冲出门来”，“跟着老虎向前追去”的。当“老虎突然丢下小孩，扭转头，张牙舞爪”向她怒吼着示威的时候，她是“奋不顾身，一股劲奔往前去抢救小孩”。当老虎抢起小孩再走时，她就不只是追了，而是“捡起两块石头奔往大路，超越到老虎前面”，当头拦住去路。当王圆爱跌了一跤，老虎又丢掉小孩的时候，这应该说是千钧一发的危险时刻了，而她却是“从地上爬起来，就冲上前去，把身受重伤的小孩紧紧地抱在怀里”。这时的她是“精疲力竭”，抱着小孩坐在地上，“她看着老虎，老虎也看着她。”在这种虎视耽耽相持不下的场合，其紧张其危险的程度，用论者的口气说，是“无以复加”的了。但这时的王圆爱的精神状态不是惊悸、恐惧、犹疑，而是因已抢到小孩而“感到非常兴奋”。她勇于追虎是为了救一小孩，在万分危险中仍然“非常兴奋”，是因已抢救出了小孩。此外便一切置之度外，何曾见她有半点个人利害的考虑，何曾见她有丝毫惧色。这是崇高的英雄品质。这种朴素的英雄本色，岂是当年武松所能比拟的！
    有一种人会说这是“初生犊儿不怕虎”，那么“六一老人”赤手空拳打虎又作如何解释呢？非有热爱人民胜过爱惜个人生命的伟大的心，才能成为真正不怕“虎”的英雄。在我们国家里这种具有伟大心灵的普通人是很多的。舍己救人的罗盛教，在战斗中牺牲个人以保存更多人的生命的黄继光、董存瑞，以及以身堵口，护堤抢险的人们，不都是同具有王圆爱这样伟大的心吗？伟大的心胸是不择男、女、老、幼之躯的。所有这些人都值得我们尊敬，都值得我们学习。
