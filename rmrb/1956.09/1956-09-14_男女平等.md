    "Equality Between Men and Women"
    Due to limitations in physical condition, some excessively heavy physical labor is beyond the capacity of women. However, some enterprise leaders insist on "equality between men and women," forcing female workers to work as hard as male workers.

    Recently, leaders of the No. 1 Warehouse of the Siping City Grain Bureau in Jilin Province called on female workers carrying flour to emulate male workers. Originally, it was already quite a load for female workers to carry two bags of flour at a time, but this leader encouraged them to carry more. Under his "encouragement," a female worker named Wang Guizhen carried three bags of flour at once, immediately turning pale and gasping for breath. However, the warehouse leader only saw that she had broken the female workers' carrying record and happily exclaimed, "Add another bag!" As a result, when the fourth bag of flour was placed on her shoulder, her spinal column was crushed.

    It is already inappropriate to have female workers do the heavy work of carrying flour, and to demand that female workers emulate male workers is simply forcing them to risk their lives!

    “男女平等”
    由于生理条件的限制，有些过重的体力劳动，妇女是不能胜任的。可是，有些企业的领导人员却硬是要求“男女平等”，让女工像男工一样干活。
    最近，吉林省四平市粮食局第一仓库的领导人员就号召背面粉的女工向男工看齐。本来，女工每次背两袋面已经是不轻了，这位领导人员却还鼓励她们多背。女工王桂珍在他的“鼓舞”下，一次背上了三袋面，当时就累得脸色发青，气也喘不上来了。可是，仓库领导人只看见她突破了女工背面纪录，就高兴地大呼一声：“再来一袋。”结果，当第四袋面压到她肩上的时候，她的脊柱骨就被压断了。
    让女工做背面粉的重活，已经不够恰当，还要求女工向男工看齐，这不是逼着女工拚命吗？
