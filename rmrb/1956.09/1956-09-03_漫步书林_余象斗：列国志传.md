    Yu Xiangdou's *Romance of the States*
    This book has a history. It was "rescued" from a pile of waste paper by a "specialist" from an old Shanghai bookstore when he was collecting books in Huizhou. This incident was even reported in a Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Shanghai. What's so remarkable about this novel that it deserves such "high-profile" publicity? There's a story here. Yu Xiangdou was a "publisher" from Jian'an County, Fujian Province, during the Wanli period of the Ming Dynasty (1573-1619). He had published many books, mostly novels. He published *Water Margin*, *Romance of the Three Kingdoms*, *Chronicles of the Two Jin Dynasties*, and *Journey to the Four Seas*. This *Romance of the States* was also published by him. He not only published books, but he also compiled them. He himself edited the "Southern Journey" and "Northern Journey" in *Journey to the Four Seas*. He was a publisher closely connected with the masses. We must realize how much those who compiled and published "novels" were looked down upon by "defenders of morality" in feudal society! They were either accused of being lewd and promoting robbery, or cursed that their homes would be burned by "heavenly fire." However, how much did the common people need to read literary works that did not praise the emperor's sagacity, were beneficial to themselves, and could move them, excite them, amaze them, make them weep at times, laugh at times, rejoice at times, and grieve at times. Yu Xiangdou, and other publishers with courage who disregarded the ridicule of the "world" (mainly in the areas of Jianyang, Nanjing, Suzhou, and Hangzhou), supplied this need. We can say that we should thank them for being able to see many "unrefined" novels and operas to this day. However, the more people read this kind of "leisure book," the more easily it is lost and destroyed. Not that it was burned—of course, some "defenders of morality" would gather and burn it—but because so many people read it, borrowing it back and forth, reading and discarding it, reading and losing it, and even reading until the paper rotted, it would be finished. Therefore, these novels and books that were welcomed by the common people were the most difficult to pass down. Furthermore, collectors knew to cherish ancient good editions of books, such as Song dynasty imprints, Yuan dynasty imprints, and Ming dynasty manuscripts, and often carried them with them when fleeing from disasters, so they could survive the calamities. As for these novels, they were originally objects of leisure, "unrefined," who would carefully preserve and protect them? Therefore, they were destroyed more quickly and easily. Jian'an edition novels often appear in Anhui, which shows that Anhui Province, especially the Huizhou area, had relatively few disturbances and rarely suffered from wars, so "leisure books" and the like could be preserved relatively well. I have been to Jianyang (i.e., Jian'an), and there is nothing left there. The bookstore had long since closed—probably in the early Qing Dynasty, or at the latest in the mid-Qing Dynasty, Jian'an editions of books were no longer seen—it is as difficult as climbing to the sky to find a Ming Dynasty Jian'an edition, let alone a Song or Yuan Dynasty Jian'an edition. Only the setting sun shines on the mountains, proving that it was once a publishing center that was "extremely prosperous for three dynasties" (Song, Yuan, and Ming). The Yu family had been engaged in book publishing for generations. The "Book of Rites with Zheng Xuan's Commentary," by Yu Renzhong of the Song dynasty, is even more famous. This Yu Xiangdou may be a descendant of the Yu family of the Song dynasty (Southern Song: 1127-1279). Then, his family has been engaged in the publishing business for at least three hundred years. Is there a publisher in the world with a history as long as his family?
    Yu Xiangdou's style name was Wentai, and his pseudonym was Santai Shanren. A characteristic of the books he published is that he inherited the style of Jian'an edition books since the Song and Yuan dynasties, and paid special attention to "illustrations," like the "comic strips" printed now, with illustrations on the upper level and text on the lower level. The combination of pictures and text doubles the interest of readers. This *Romance of the States* is also engraved in this ancient style. Although the illustrations are narrow and long strips, and the figures are small, they are very vivid and lively. At a glance, you can tell that the skill of drawing and engraving is not shallow. In terms of content, it has been compared with Chen Meigong's edition of *Romance of the States*, and there is not much difference.
    This book, which the old Shanghai bookstore obtained from Huizhou at once, only had one remaining volume, that is, the last, eighth volume. Why do we value such a fragment of a novel so much? It is not entirely because it is a Ming Dynasty engraving by Yu Xiangdou, exquisitely engraved and extremely rare, but more importantly because it was "rescued" from a pile of waste paper. Originally, there had long been a clear order prohibiting the use of ancient books for papermaking. However, it was not thoroughly implemented, and paper mills in various places have destroyed countless useful good books and materials. Sichuan Province once rescued the manuscript of Wu Yu's diary, "Only Hand Fighting Confucius' Shop," which was as many as a hundred volumes. Zhejiang Province rescued the archives preserved in the home of Wu Xu, who served as the Shanghai Daotai during the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom period and colluded with the imperialists to organize the "Ever-Victorious Army." Mr. Zhao Shiliuo of Nanjing once obtained the complete book of thirty volumes of the Song Dynasty engraving of *Jin Shi Lu* from old books sold by the load. Shanghai has also found many good books and materials in the old books collected by paper mills to be made into paper pulp. There are even more good books and materials that have been destroyed silently without being discovered! Once lost, they will never see the light of day again! Anhui Province is a province of literature, and the Huizhou area in particular is a concentration of ancient books. According to the "expert" from Shanghai, there were countless bundles of ancient books waiting to be "put into the pot and turned into pulp." He wanted to carefully examine them, but the people at the paper mill were impatient, so he had to end the search hastily and return. He also saw firecracker shops using books printed on Ming Dynasty white cotton paper, tearing off a page and a half as the core of firecrackers. It is said that using this kind of good paper to make firecrackers makes them explode particularly loudly. He discussed with them whether they could pick out something from the pile of paper. But they refused outright, and wouldn't even let him open the bundles of paper. Isn't this very sad? Not only should Anhui Province thoroughly and vigorously prevent the continued progress of such waste and destruction of literature and scientific research materials, but other places should also work hard to prevent the use of ancient books as waste paper and as raw materials for paper pulp. In some places, people who collect waste paper, in order to avoid trouble from the cultural departments, deliberately tear and shred whole books before packing and shipping them out, so that no one will pick up anything, just like the "cooperatives" that collect "scrap copper," if they receive ancient bronzes or old bronze Buddha statues, etc., they will first smash and break them into pieces, small pieces, to prevent people from the "Cultural Relics Management Committee" etc. from selecting them. We don't understand what kind of psychology is at work here! This volume of *Romance of the States* is fortunate enough not to have "sunk to the bottom of the sea unjustly," but what about the other "seven volumes"? They have been turned into paper pulp! Seeing the "rescue" of this one volume makes us feel all the more heartbroken about the inability to "rescue" the other volumes and countless other books in time! This is the main reason why we want to publicize this book, or this one volume, in such a "high-profile" way.

    余象斗：列国志传
    这部书大有历史。它是一家上海古书铺的“专家”，到徽州收书的时候，从废纸堆里“救”出来的。这件事还曾见之于新华社的上海通讯。这末一部小说有什么了不起，值得这样“大张旗鼓”地宣传着呢？这里面有文章。余象斗是明代万历年间（1573年——1619年）的福建省建安县的一个“出版家”。曾经刻过不少书，而以小说书刻得最多。他刻过“水浒”，刻过“三国”，刻过“两晋志传”，刻过“四游记”。这部“列国志传”也便是他所刻的。他不仅刻书，他还编书。“四游记”里有“南游记”和“北游记”，就是他自己动手编辑的。他是一位与人民大众密切结合的出版家。我们要知道，在封建社会里，编刻“小说”的人是多末被“卫道之士”看不起！不是说他们诲淫、诲盗，就是咒诅他们要被“天火”烧家。然而，老百姓们是多末需要看些不是颂扬皇上圣明的，与他们自己有些益处的，且是能够使他们感动，使他们兴奋，使他们惊叹，使他们时而泣，时而笑，时而喜，时而悲的文学作品啊。余象斗，还有其他有勇气而不顾“世俗”诽笑的出版家们（主要是在建阳、南京、苏州、杭州一带的），便供应了他们的这种需要。我们到今天还能够见到许多“不登大雅之堂”的小说、戏曲，可以说应该感谢他们。然而这一类的“闲书”看的人越多，便越容易散失、毁亡。倒不是被烧掉——当然，有些“卫道之士”是要聚而焚之——而是因为看得人多，借来借去，看抛掉，看散失了，甚至看得纸张腐烂了，就此完蛋。所以，这些受老百姓们欢迎的小说书等，最难流传得下来。还有，古代好版本的书，像宋刻本、元刻本、明钞本等等，藏书家们还知道十分宝爱，逃难时，每每挟之而逃，故能够历劫犹存。像这些小说书呢，原是消闲之物，“不登大雅之堂”的，谁还肯慎重地保存、保护着他们呢？以此便消灭得更快、更易了。建安版的小说书，而每在安徽出现，这说明了安徽省，特别徽州一带地方，变乱比较少，罕遭兵燹，故“闲书”等等，还比较地能够保存下来。我曾到过建阳（即建安），那里是什么也没有了。书店早已歇业——可能在清初，至迟在清代中叶，就不见有建版的书了——要找一本明代建版的书，难如登天，更不用说什么宋、元时代的建版书了。只剩下夕阳斜照在群山上，证明那里曾经是“盛极三朝”（宋、元、明）的一个出版中心而已。余氏世业刻书。所谓宋、余仁仲本的“礼记郑注”更有大名。这个余象斗，可能就是宋代（南宋：1127年——1279年）余家的后裔吧。那末，他的一家，经营出版事业，至少已有三百多年了。世界上有像他家似的历史那末悠久的一家出版商么？
    余象斗字文台，号三台山人。他所刻的书，有一个特点，那就是继承了宋、元以来的建安版书籍的型式，特别着意于“插图”，就像现在印行的“连环图画”似的，上层是插图，下层是文字。图、文并茂，使读者们阅之，兴趣倍增。这部“列国志传”也就是刻成这样古老的型式的。插图虽是狭长的一条，人物形象虽小，却十分生动活泼，一望而知，绘、刻的工夫不浅。内容方面曾与陈眉公本的“列国志传”相对读，差别不大。
    这部书，上海古书铺一下从徽州得来，只残存一册，即最后的第八册。像这样的小说残本，我们为什么如此的看重它呢？倒不完全为了它是明代余象斗的刻本，刻得精美，流传得极少之故，更重要的原因，还为的它是从废纸堆里“抢救”出来的。原来，禁止以古书造纸，早已有了明令。但未能贯彻下去，各地造纸厂，不知毁坏了多少有用的好书和资料。四川省曾经抢救出“只手打孔家店”的吴虞的日记的稿本，足足有百册。浙江省救出了太平天国时代做过上海道，和帝国主义者们勾结起来，组织“长胜军”的吴煦家里所保存的档案。南京赵世邏先生曾从论担称斤的旧书里，获得了宋刻本的“金石录”三十卷的全书。上海方面，也在造纸厂所收集的将作纸浆的旧书里，找出了不少好书、好资料。没有被发现而在不声不响之中被毁灭了的好书、好资料，更不知道有多少！一旦失去，从此不见天日！安徽省是一个文献之邦，徽州一带，尤为古旧书籍集中之地。据上海的那位“专家”告诉我，一扎一扎的古书，不知道有多少，在等待着“入锅化浆”。他想仔细地检查一番，但造纸厂的人却不耐烦了，只好草草地收场回来。又曾看见炮仗铺里，用明朝白绵纸印的书，撕得一页半页的作为鞭炮的心子，据说，用这种好纸做炮仗，会放得特别响。他和他们商量，能否在纸堆里检些什么出来。但他们干脆地拒绝了，连纸捆子也不让打开。这不是很可伤心的事么？不仅安徽省得好好地、大力地杜绝这样的蹧蹋、毁坏文献和科学研究的资料的事的继续进展下去，别的地方也应该同样努力地防止把古书作为废纸，作为造纸浆的原料。有的地方，收废纸的人为了怕文化部门的人打麻烦，在打包运出之前，就把整本、整部的书，故意地先行撕破扯烂，省得有人来检拾什么，正像收集“废铜”的“社”，收到古代青铜器或旧的铜佛像等等，便先行打烂敲碎，碎得一片片地，一小块一小块地，以免“文管会”等等的人来挑选。我们不明白，这是什么一种心理在作祟！这一册“列国志传”是幸运地不至“冤沉海底”了，但其他“七册”呢？已化为纸浆了！见此一册的得“救”，益盛感他册，乃至无数他书的不能及时“救”出的痛心！这便是我们之所以要这样“大张旗鼓”宣传这部、或这一册书的主要原因了。
