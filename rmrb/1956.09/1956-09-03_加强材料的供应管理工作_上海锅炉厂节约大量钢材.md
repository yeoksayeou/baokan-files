Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 31st - By improving its material supply work, the state-owned Shanghai Boiler Factory, which consumes a large amount of steel each month, has saved nearly 600 tons of steel in the past six months.

In the past, when the supply section of the Shanghai Boiler Factory purchased steel, it always planned to "be prepared for the unexpected". Procurement staff believed that "more is always better than less". Once, when purchasing a type of steel with an actual demand of less than 110 tons, the purchaser bought 163 tons on the market, resulting in a backlog of more than 50 tons of steel.

In the past, warehouse material distribution was also done on a "give what you have" and "take what you want" basis. As long as the workshop sent a slip, regardless of whether it should be received or not, materials were issued if available, often resulting in entire sheets of steel being cut into odd shapes. No attention was paid to the timely recovery and utilization of leftover short pieces and waste materials from the workshops. As a result, more and more stagnant materials accumulated in the warehouse, and the workshop surroundings were "paved with steel," while the steel needed for production could not be supplied in a timely manner.

Starting last year, the supply section strengthened the planned management of material procurement and supply, making the plans more timely and closer to reality. This year, based on the socialist competition among all factory workers, the supply section comprehensively implemented quota-based material distribution in the first workshop, the mechanical workshop, and the forging workshop. At the same time, it strengthened warehouse management and the recovery and utilization of waste materials and iron filings. Now, after receiving the "Material Allocation Quota Card," the warehouse first looks for materials from waste and short pieces, trying to utilize waste or short pieces to remanufacture suitable materials. Small pieces of waste steel plates are also processed and drawn into iron sheets for strapping, and short steel pipes with large diameters are processed and drawn into long steel pipes with small diameters. In the first half of the year, more than 70 tons of flat steel and more than 40 tons of steel pipes were remanufactured using waste materials or short pieces, of which 80% have been used in production. With the consent of the design department and ensuring that product quality is not affected, the first metal workshop of this factory also used spliced steel plates to manufacture a batch of steam drums for boilers, saving more than 110 tons of boiler steel plates that are difficult to buy on the market.

### 加强材料的供应管理工作  上海锅炉厂节约大量钢材

    加强材料的供应管理工作
    上海锅炉厂节约大量钢材
    新华社上海31日电　每月耗用大量钢材的国营上海锅炉厂，由于改善了材料供应工作，最近半年来节约了近六百吨钢材。
    上海锅炉厂供应科过去采购钢材，总是打算“有备无患”，采购人员认为：“多一些总比没有好”。有一次采购一种实际需用量不到一百十吨的钢材，采购员到市场上却买进了一百六十三吨，因此积压钢材五十多吨。
    过去仓库发料也是“有啥发啥”、“要啥拿啥”，只要车间来了条子，不管该领不该领，有料就发，往往整张钢材被割得七零八落，对车间用剩的零短料和废料，也不注意及时回收利用。结果，仓库里呆滞材料越积越多，车间周围是“钢铁铺地”，而生产上需要的钢材，还是不能及时供应。
    供应科从去年开始加强材料采购、供应的计划管理工作，使计划编制得更及时和更接近实际。今年在全厂职工社会主义竞赛的基础上，供应科又在第一车间、机械车间和锻工车间，全面推行了限额发料，并且同时加强了仓库管理工作和废料铁屑的回收利用。现在仓库接到“材料拨发限额卡”后，他们首先从废料和零短料中去找，尽量利用废料或零短料改制成适用的材料。割下来的小块钢板废料，也去加工拉成打包用的铁皮，大口径的短钢管，加工拉制成小口径的长钢管。上半年内利用废料或零短料改制的七十多吨扁钢、四十多吨钢管，其中有80％已经用到生产上去。在得到设计科同意并保证不影响产品质量的原则下，这个厂第一金属车间还利用并接的钢板制造了一批锅炉上的汽包，节约了一百一十多吨市面上难以买到的锅炉钢板。
