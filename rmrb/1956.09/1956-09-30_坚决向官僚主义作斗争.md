Comrade Qian Ying, Minister of Supervision, spoke:

    I fully support Chairman Mao's opening speech and fully agree with the reports of Comrades Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, and Deng Xiaoping.
    These reports affirm the great victories our Party has led the people of the whole country to achieve in the revolution and the splendid achievements in socialist construction during the eleven years from the Seventh National Congress to the Eighth National Congress; at the same time, these reports emphatically point out that at present, in the work of our Party and state organs, there is a growing trend of bureaucracy, which brings many harms to our cause, which should arouse our profound vigilance. From the situation we have learned in the course of our inspection work, the vast majority of leading cadres in state organs at all levels are loyal to the cause of socialism, pay attention to investigation and research, connect with the masses, resolutely implement the Party's policies and strive to complete the tasks assigned by the Party and the state; but we also see that there is varying degrees of bureaucracy in many tasks of state organs, causing serious waste of state financial, material and human resources and adverse political effects. This year, state supervisory organs at all levels have inspected the product quality of many state-owned factories and mines at the central and local levels, and found that the product quality of some units does not meet national indicators, and some have declined compared with last year. For example, the average actual ash content of raw coal in the Tonghua Mining Bureau in the first quarter of this year was as high as 33.98 percent, which was 122.9 percent of that in 1954. In November and December 1955, the Xiaohengshan Coal Mine of the Jixi Mining Bureau sent 25,000 tons of coal to the Harbin Coal Construction Company, with an average gangue content of 40 percent. One truck of coal was even 80 percent rock. Because the coal of some units has high gangue, high ash, and high moisture content, it not only causes the false phenomenon of coal production, but also wastes the country's transportation capacity. At the same time, because the washed clean coal supplied to metallurgical enterprises is substandard, it also affects metallurgical production. Some enterprise staff members not only do not actively take measures to improve and improve the low quality of products, but instead take speculative and fraudulent methods to deceive users. For example, the open hearth furnace workshop of Daye Steel Plant only completed 98.8% of the production task in January this year. At the end of the month, the head of the technical section and the director of the workshop, with the consent of individual leaders of the plant, selected more than 30 tons from more than 70 tons of scrap steel produced in December last year to put into the warehouse to top the task, and reported that the plan was 100.1% completed. From January to March this year, the Benxi Cement Plant shipped 1,807 tons of substandard cement, many of which were shipped as qualified products by tampering with original records in the laboratory.
    In the past few years, the supervisory organs of various provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government have repeatedly inspected the work of grain storage and custody, and every year they have found a large amount of insect-damaged grain and damp grain, as well as losses caused by mold, fire, embezzlement, theft, and damage by rats and birds, which are also quite serious. But every year there are inspections, and there are still many problems every year. For example, in the first half of this year, the supervisory organs of 20 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government, including Anhui, Inner Mongolia, and Shanghai, jointly conducted a general survey of more than 42.6 billion catties of grain (including oil), and found more than 13.1 billion catties of damp grain, and more than 330,000 catties of losses caused by mold. In some warehouses, insect-damaged grain even reached 80% to 90% of the stored grain, and the density of insects was as high as 30,000 per kilogram in individual cases. During the general survey, more than 7.9 billion catties of unsafe grain were disposed of, more than 2.64 million rats and birds were eliminated, and 19.765 million catties of garbage were removed. Some units of the commercial sector have also suffered great losses of state assets due to chaotic management, large circulation expenses, and poor warehouse management. In some areas, in the construction of farmland water conservancy, the promotion of fine varieties, and the change of farming methods, orders are issued only based on subjective wishes without considering the actual situation of the local area and without consulting with the masses, and the cadres below force the masses to promote them, resulting in serious production reductions, waste of labor, and dissatisfaction among the masses.
    The above-mentioned serious situations have various objective reasons, such as equipment not matching tasks, lack of experience, and low technical level; but also because some staff members are irresponsible, and some leaders do not go deep into the grassroots to check their work and do not understand the situation. Some have discovered problems but have not taken active measures to improve them. This proves that the struggle against bureaucracy pointed out in Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report is completely necessary and correct, which is of great significance for improving our work and accelerating socialist construction.
    Bureaucracy has deep social roots in our country, and it will take a long and unremitting struggle to overcome this phenomenon. First of all, Party committees at all levels must strengthen their leadership over state organs and enterprises, and adopt the method of rectification within a certain period of time, so that the bureaucratic style can be deeply exposed and criticized. The relevant departments of the Party committee must regularly understand the political ideology and work of cadres in an all-round way by checking the implementation of the Party's resolutions and policies in state organs and enterprises. Strengthen the leadership of the Party's grassroots organizations in state organs, enterprises, and rural areas, so that they can ensure the implementation of the Party's policies and resolutions and become a strong fortress for the struggle against bureaucracy. It must be good at using the weapon of criticism and self-criticism, effectively protect the democratic rights of Party members and the people, and give full play to their supervisory role over leading organs and cadres. It is necessary to prevent lowering the level of Party work and adopting an accommodating and tolerant attitude towards some Party member cadres who are seriously derelict in their duties and violate laws and disciplines; or not patiently educating and helping some Party member cadres who have made general mistakes and shortcomings in their work to correct their shortcomings and mistakes, but only giving them disciplinary sanctions.
    The huge and overlapping state administrative organs are a breeding ground for bureaucracy. Therefore, with the improvement of the administrative system of state organs, with the devolution of many tasks, according to the specific conditions of various departments and regions, some huge administrative and institutional organs should be conscientiously streamlined, and a group of cadres should be devolved in a planned way to strengthen the backbone forces of enterprises and rural work. In this way, leading cadres of state organs at all levels can often go deep into the grassroots to check the implementation of the tasks assigned to lower levels and the resolutions, orders, and plans issued, and examine whether these resolutions, orders, and plans are correct from the inspection; This also makes it easier for some leading cadres to have sufficient time to directly listen to the work reports of their subordinates, study the problems and difficulties existing in their work, conscientiously summarize experiences and lessons, take effective measures, correct shortcomings and mistakes, and improve their work.
    The state supervisory organs also have certain responsibilities if bureaucracy cannot be effectively overcome. In the past few years, under the unified leadership of the Central Committee and Party committees at all levels, state supervisory organs at all levels have also done a lot of work in opposing bureaucracy and played a certain role. However, because we also have the same subjective idealism and bureaucratic style of being divorced from the masses and divorced from reality, we do not study the Party's policies in depth, we have a very poor understanding of the situation in various aspects, and we do not study and learn enough about various knowledge of economic construction. Therefore, in the inspection work, it is not easy to find the root causes of problems and hit the key points. Also, because we lack the courage to fight against bureaucracy and our principles are not strong, when we encounter difficulties in our work or the inspected unit has different opinions, we lack the active spirit to patiently study with them, seriously unfold debates, distinguish right from wrong, and adhere to the truth, so that many problems cannot be solved, affecting the effectiveness of supervision work.
    In order to give full play to the due role of state supervisory organs in the struggle against bureaucracy, it is hoped that Party committees at all levels and Party organizations of various departments will strengthen the leadership of state supervisory organs, regularly discuss and check their work, correct the shortcomings in their work, support their correct opinions, and gradually improve the institutions of supervisory work and improve the quality of supervisory cadres. The Party groups of state supervisory organs at all levels must promptly report the situation to the Party committee, ask for instructions and report on their work, must resolutely implement the Party's mass line, rely closely on the Party organization and the broad masses of the people to do a good job in supervision, must establish close contact with relevant departments, and obtain the cooperation and support of all parties. At the same time, state supervisory organs at all levels and all supervisory personnel must also often be under the supervision of the Party and the broad masses of the people, work diligently, be humble and cautious, overcome the shortcomings in their work, strive to improve the quality of supervision work, help the inspected departments correct their shortcomings and mistakes, improve their work, and better fulfill the responsibilities entrusted to us by the Party, so that the state supervisory organs can become a powerful weapon for Party committees and governments at all levels to check policies and resolutions and oppose bureaucracy.
    I believe that under the strong leadership of the Party and the close supervision of the broad masses of the people, the ideological level of cadres in our state organs will definitely continue to improve, bureaucracy will definitely be gradually overcome, and our socialist construction will definitely advance from victory to victory.

    坚决向官僚主义作斗争
    监察部部长　钱瑛同志的发言
    我完全拥护毛主席的开幕词，完全同意刘少奇同志、周恩来同志和邓小平同志的报告。
    这些报告肯定了我们党从七次代表大会到八次代表大会这十一年的期间领导着全国人民在革命中所获得的伟大胜利和在社会主义建设中所获得的辉煌成就；同时这些报告中都强调的指出来，目前在我们党和国家机关工作中间，滋长着官僚主义的倾向，给我们的事业带来许多危害，这是应该引起我们深刻警惕的。从我们检查工作中间所了解的情况来看，各级国家机关绝大多数领导干部是忠诚于社会主义事业，注意调查研究，联系群众，坚决贯彻党的方针政策，努力完成党和国家所给予的任务的；但也看到国家机关许多工作中存在着不同程度的官僚主义，造成了国家财力、物力、人力的严重浪费和政治上的不良影响。各级国家监察机关今年检查了许多中央和地方国营厂矿企业中的产品质量，发现有些单位产品质量达不到国家指标，有些反比去年下降，如通化矿务局今年第一季度原煤平均实际灰分高达百分之三十三点九八，为一九五四年的百分之一百二十二点九。鸡西矿务局小恒山煤矿一九五五年十一月份和十二月份发给哈尔滨煤建公司二万五千吨煤中，平均含矸率达到百分之四十，有一车煤里竟有百分之八十是石头。由于有些单位煤炭的含矸多、灰分高、水分大，不仅造成煤炭产量的虚假现象，而且浪费了国家的运输力，同时由于供应冶金企业的洗精煤不合格，也影响冶金生产。有些企业工作人员对产品质量低劣的现象，不但不积极采取措施去改进提高，反而采取投机取巧、弄虚作假的方法欺骗用户。如大冶钢厂平炉车间，今年一月份生产任务只完成百分之九十八点八，在月底时技术科长和车间主任经过厂的个别领导人员同意，从去年十二月生产的七十多吨废钢中，挑选了三十多吨入库顶任务，上报完成计划百分之一百点一。本溪水泥厂今年一月至三月出厂一千八百零七吨不合格的水泥，其中有许多是在化验上采取涂改原始记录等方法混充合格品出厂的。
    几年来各省、自治区、直辖市监察机关多次检查了粮食仓储保管工作，每年都发现大量的虫粮、潮粮，以及由于霉烂、失火、贪污盗窃、鼠雀损耗等而造成的损失，也是相当严重的。但年年检查，年年存在不少问题。如今年上半年安徽、内蒙古、上海等二十个省、自治区、直辖市监察机关联合有关部门普查粮食共四百二十六亿多斤（包括油料），发现潮粮一百三十一亿多斤，由于霉变而造成的损失三十三万多斤，有的仓库虫粮甚至达到存粮的百分之八十至九十，虫的密度个别的一公斤达三万头。普查中，处理了不安全粮七十九亿多斤，消灭鼠雀二百六十四万多只，清除垃圾一千九百七十六万五千斤。商业部门有些单位由于经营管理混乱，流转费用很大以及仓库保管不善造成国家资财的损失也是很大的。有些地区在兴修农田水利、推广良种、改变耕作方法中，不根据当地实际情况，不与群众商量，只凭主观愿望下达命令，而下面干部强迫群众推行，致造成严重减产，浪费劳动力，引起群众不满。
    上述这些严重情况，有种种客观原因，如设备与任务不相适应、经验不足、技术水平不高等；但也由于有些工作人员不负责任，有些领导上不深入下层检查工作，不了解情况。有的虽然发现了问题但又未积极采取措施，加以改进。这都证明刘少奇同志报告中所指出的开展反对官僚主义的斗争，是完全必要的和正确的，这对于改进我们的工作，加速社会主义建设，具有重大意义。
    官僚主义在我们国家中，有其深厚的社会根源，要克服这种现象，将需要长期不懈的斗争。首先是要各级党委加强对国家机关、企业的领导，在一定时期内采取整风的方法，使官僚主义的作风受到深刻的揭发和批判，党委有关部门要经常地通过检查党的决议政策在国家机关、企业中贯彻执行的情况，来全面地了解干部的政治思想和工作情况。加强对国家机关、企业及农村党的基层组织领导，使它能够保证党的政策决议的贯彻，成为反官僚主义斗争的坚强堡垒。使它善于运用批评与自我批评的武器，切实保护党员和人民群众的民主权利，充分发挥他们对领导机关和干部的监督作用。必须防止降低党的工作水平，对一些严重失职和违法乱纪的党员干部采取迁就姑息的态度；或者对一些在工作中犯一般性错误和缺点的党员干部，不耐心教育和帮助他们纠正缺点、错误，而只予以纪律制裁。
    国家行政机构庞大、重叠，是官僚主义滋长的温床。因此，应该随着国家机关的行政体制的改进，随着许多工作的下放，根据各部门各地区的具体情况，认真地精简一些庞大的行政和事业机构，有计划地下放一批干部，加强企业单位和农村工作的骨干力量。这样就可以使各级国家机关的领导干部，能够经常深入下层，检查自己对下级布置的任务及所发布的决议、命令、计划的执行情况，并从检查中考察这些决议、命令、计划是否正确；这样也便于一些领导干部有充分的时间，直接听取所属下级的工作汇报，研究工作中存在的问题和困难，认真地总结经验教训，采取有效的措施，纠正缺点错误，改进工作。
    官僚主义不能得到有效的克服，国家监察机关也有一定的责任。几年来各级国家监察机关在中央和各级党委的统一领导下，在反对官僚主义方面也做了不少工作，起到一些作用。但由于我们也同样存在着脱离群众脱离实际的主观主义、官僚主义作风，对党的方针政策钻研不深，对各方面的情况了解很差，对经济建设的各种知识钻研和学习的不够，因而在检查工作中，不容易发现问题产生的根本原因，打不中要害。也由于我们向官僚主义斗争的勇气不足，原则性不强，在工作中一遇到困难或被检查单位有不同意见的时候，缺乏积极主动的精神与他们耐心研究，严肃地展开争论，分清是非，坚持真理，致使许多问题得不到解决，影响监察工作效果。
    为了充分发挥国家监察机关在反对官僚主义斗争中应有的作用，希望各级党委和各部门党组织加强对国家监察机关的领导，定期讨论和检查他们的工作，纠正他们工作中的缺点，支持他们正确的意见，逐步地健全监察工作的机构，提高监察干部的质量。各级国家监察机关的党组必须及时地向党委反映情况，请示报告工作，必须坚决贯彻党的群众路线，紧紧依靠党的组织和广大人民群众作好监察工作，必须要与有关部门建立密切联系，取得各方面的配合与支持。同时各级国家监察机关和所有监察人员，也必须经常在党和广大群众的监督之下，勤勤恳恳谦虚谨慎，克服工作中的缺点，努力地提高监察工作的质量，帮助被检查部门纠正缺点错误，改进工作，更好地完成党赋予我们的职责，使国家监察机关成为各级党委和政府检查政策决议、反对官僚主义的有力武器。
    我相信在党的坚强领导和广大人民群众的密切监督之下，我们国家机关的干部思想水平一定可以不断地提高，官僚主义一定可以逐渐地克服，我们的社会主义建设一定可以从胜利走向胜利。
