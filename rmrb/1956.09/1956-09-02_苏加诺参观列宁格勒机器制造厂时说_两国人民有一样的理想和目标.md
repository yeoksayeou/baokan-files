Xinhua News Agency, Leningrad, September 1st: According to TASS, Indonesian President Sukarno and his entourage visited the Leningrad Machine Building Plant and the Mosque on the afternoon of August 31st, and attended a concert held at the Leningrad Conservatory in the evening.

    After visiting the Leningrad Machine Building Plant, President Sukarno attended a welcoming rally held for him by thousands of workers from the factory and spoke at the meeting. He said that there are close ties between the people of the Soviet Union and Indonesia that no one can break. You are working hard for a free and happy life, for a life of peaceful coexistence with all countries. The ideals of the Indonesian people are the same. We are working hard to strive for a happy peace, to strive for peaceful coexistence with the people of all countries.

    Sukarno emphasized that Indonesia's political revolution has not yet been completed, and its territory of West Irian has not yet been liberated. He said that we will fight unswervingly and perseveringly. We know that not only the Asian and African countries participating in the Bandung Conference sympathize with us, but also all progressive mankind. We know that the Soviet people sympathize with us. It is precisely for this reason that we do not feel lonely, but believe that the result of our struggle will definitely be to liberate West Irian.

    Sukarno said, comrades, our common goal is to realize a world in which people can live in peace and friendship, and to realize a new world in which people can live a peaceful and happy life. Let us cooperate to achieve this great goal.
    Sukarno finally asked the workers of the factory to shout "Merdeka" (meaning freedom) five times with him, and all those present shouted with him in unison.
    The atmosphere of the meeting was very warm, and the masses finally shouted "Long live the friendship between the Soviet people and the Indonesian people!"

    苏加诺参观列宁格勒机器制造厂时说
    两国人民有一样的理想和目标
    新华社1日讯　据塔斯社列宁格勒讯：印度尼西亚共和国总统苏加诺和他的随行人员在8月31日下午参观了列宁格勒机器制造厂和清真寺，并且在晚上出席了在列宁格勒音乐馆举行的音乐会。
    在参观列宁格勒机器制造厂以后，苏加诺总统参加了这个工厂的几千名工人为他举行的欢迎大会，并且在会上讲了话。他说，苏联和印度尼西亚人民之间存在着任何人都无法打破的密切联系。你们正在为自由和幸福的生活、为同一切国家和平相处的生活而努力。我们印度尼西亚人民的理想也是一样的。我们正在努力争取一种幸福的和平，争取同一切国家的人民和平相处。
    苏加诺强调指出，印度尼西亚的政治革命还没有完成，她的领土西伊里安还没有得到自由。他说，我们将毫不退缩地和坚忍不拔地进行斗争。我们知道不仅参加万隆会议的亚非国家同情我们，而且所有进步人类都同情我们。我们知道，苏联人民是同情我们的。正是由于这个原故，我们才不感觉孤独，而相信我们的斗争的结果一定能够解放西伊里安。
    苏加诺说，同志们，我们的共同目标是实现一个人民能够和平、友爱地生活的世界，实现一个人民能够过和平和幸福的生活的新世界。让我们合作来达到这个伟大的目标吧。
  苏加诺最后要求工厂的工人们和他一齐高呼五遍“默德卡”（即自由），到会的人一致同他高呼。
    会议的气氛非常热烈，群众最后高呼“苏联人民和印度尼西亚人民的友谊万岁！”
