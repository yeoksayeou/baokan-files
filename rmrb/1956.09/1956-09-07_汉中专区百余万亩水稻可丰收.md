    (Our report) Over 1.4 million mu of rice in Hanzhong Prefecture, Shaanxi Province, are generally growing well, and a bumper harvest is in sight. In Baocheng County, more than 160,000 mu of rice are estimated to produce an average of more than 640 jin per mu, of which about 10,000 mu can yield up to 1,000 jin per mu.
