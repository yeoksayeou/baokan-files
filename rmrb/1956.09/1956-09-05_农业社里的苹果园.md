    The Apple Orchard in the Agricultural Cooperative
    In July, as you pass through the small villages of A'shi, Nanwa, and Anzuizi in Luochuan County, Shaanxi Province, you will be attracted by the clusters of apple trees. Here, there are fifteen varieties of apples, such as "May Red," "Green Banana," "Worcester Pearmain," "Red Jade," and "Guoguang." Clusters of apples weigh down the branches.
    In the past, when these fruit trees were managed individually by each household, most farmers only knew that apples were delicious but did not know how to cultivate them. This spring, after the twenty-four households with apple trees in these three small villages and the fifty-four households in the entire village (three villages) formed an advanced agricultural cooperative, they put all their cultivated more than two thousand apple trees and more than eight thousand saplings into the cooperative for unified management.
    In order to cultivate these apple trees well, the agricultural cooperative specifically organized a seven-person apple tree cultivation team. Under their careful cultivation, the apple trees grew more luxuriantly than in any previous year, and the apples were more numerous and larger. According to preliminary calculations, the apple harvest will be more than double that of last year. He Pan

    农业社里的苹果园
    7月里，当你走过陕西洛川县的阿时、南?和安咀子三个小山庄的时候，就被那丛丛的苹果树吸引住了。这里，有“五月红”“青香蕉”“倭锦”“红玉”“国光”等十五种苹果。一嘟噜一嘟噜的苹果，把树枝都压弯了。
    在过去，这些果树由各家分散经营的时候，大部分农民只知道苹果好吃，不知道怎样栽培。今年春天，这三个小山庄的二十四户有苹果树的农民和全村（三个村）五十四户农民一起组成高级农业社后，就把自己培育的两千多棵苹果树和八千多棵幼苗全部入了社，由社来统一经营。
    为了把这些苹果树培育好，农业社专门组织了一个七人参加的培育苹果树小组。在他们的精心培育下，苹果树比以往任何一年生长的格外茂盛，结的苹果又多又大。据初步计算，将要比去年多收两倍的苹果。　河畔
