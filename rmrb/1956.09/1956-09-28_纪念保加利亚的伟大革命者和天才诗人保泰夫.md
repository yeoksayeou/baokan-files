    “He who falls in the fight for freedom never dies…”
                                  ——Hristo Botev

    This year marks the eightieth anniversary of the heroic sacrifice of Hristo Botev, the great Bulgarian revolutionary and genius poet. Botev's life and creative period coincided with the most brutal era of the Bulgarian people's suffering under five centuries of Turkish foreign rule, as well as the era of the rising revolutionary liberation struggle of the Bulgarian people. Botev deeply understood the tasks assigned to him by his era, and dedicated all his strength and talent to the liberation and progress of the Bulgarian people.

    Hristo Botev was born on December 25, 1848 (Old Calendar) in the town of Kalofer (now called Botevgrad) on the southern slopes of the Balkan Mountains. His father, Botyo Petkov, was a progressive people's teacher. His mother, Ivanka Staykova, was a virtuous woman who could sing more than four hundred Bulgarian folk songs. Botev's parents loved knowledge and cared about the suffering of the people. Botev grew up in such a family environment.

    At the age of fifteen, Botev was sent by his father to Russia to study. He studied at the Odessa High School and established connections with people with revolutionary ideas there. As a result, he was persecuted by the Bulgarian nobles living in Odessa at that time and the Tsarist local authorities, and dropped out of school midway, leaving Russia.

    The works of Russian revolutionary democrats Herzen, Belinsky, Chernyshevsky, and the dual suffering of national oppression and feudal exploitation experienced and witnessed by Botev himself among the Bulgarian people, laid the foundation for Botev's revolutionary thought.

    In the spring of 1868, Botev returned to his hometown, took over his father's work, and resumed contact with the Bulgarian people. He began to carry out extensive revolutionary propaganda activities among young people, organizing them to learn shooting and manufacture bullets in preparation for future armed struggles.

    At a memorial meeting for the "Cyril and Methodius Day" (Note), after many officials had spoken, Botev suddenly stood up and addressed the crowd. He denounced the officials' speeches which deceived the people, and called on the people to fight against Turkish tyranny. This angered the Turkish local authorities. His father, fearing that he would be persecuted, sent him to Russia to study again. When Botev passed through Romania, he met many Bulgarian exiles and found that he could dedicate himself to the cause of the people, so he stayed. He worked in Romania as a printing worker, teacher, and staff member of revolutionary publications, and engaged in revolutionary activities with exiled Bulgarian patriots. The hard life in exile did not shake his determination to serve the people in the slightest.

    Botev actively engaged in publishing revolutionary publications in Romania. In 1871, he began to publish the "Word of Bulgarian Exiles" newspaper. He wrote the two sentences "Truth is sacred, freedom is precious" on the masthead to express the newspaper's mission. He published many poems and political essays in this newspaper. Later, he founded the "Alarm Clock" (1873) and "Banner" (1874) newspapers. The newspapers he founded became banners of the Bulgarian national liberation struggle, leaving a huge impact among expatriates and even in the country.

    Botev not only persevered in the struggle on the ideological front, but also personally participated in actual revolutionary activities. He demonstrated his organizational and leadership abilities in uniting exiled Bulgarian patriots, recruiting and dispatching insurgent troops, and other work. He participated in the Bulgarian Central Revolutionary Committee. After the Bulgarian revolutionary leader Vasil Levski was killed by Turkish enslavers in 1873, Botev became the leader of the Bulgarian national liberation movement.

    In 1876, the glorious April Uprising against Turkish enslavement broke out in Bulgaria. Botev decided to immediately return to the country to participate in the uprising. On May 20 of the same year (Old Calendar), a large number of insurgent troops crossed the Danube River to the village of Kozloduy on the Bulgarian shore. This day is one of the most glorious days in Bulgarian history. Just as the troops were advancing towards the Balkan Mountains, Botev was unfortunately struck down by a Turkish bullet near Vola Peak, ending his short but brilliant life.

    Botev sacrificed himself for the cause of Bulgaria's national liberation. His fighting life left a glorious and lofty example for the Bulgarian people, and he is always respected and commemorated by the Bulgarian people. Every year on June 2, Bulgarian youths organize climbing teams to go to Okolchitsa Peak, where Botev's insurgent troops were martyred, to mourn Botev. June 2 has become a day for the Bulgarian people to commemorate the martyrs who fell for the freedom of their motherland. Almost all of Botev's poems have been set to music and are widely circulated among the people. How many factories, farms, and schools are named after him! The secret radio station that inspired and called on the people to carry out armed struggle during the war against German fascism was named "Hristo Botev." Even today, the call sign of Sofia Radio is "Hristo Botev."

    Botev sacrificed himself at the age of twenty-eight. He left only twenty poems to future generations. But these poems are the most precious treasure of Bulgarian literature. His life and his works are forever a great force inspiring the Bulgarian people to fight for the independence, freedom, and beautiful future of their motherland. How many anti-fascist fighters and guerrillas sang Botev's poems and calmly gave their lives!

    “He who falls in the fight for freedom never dies: the earth, the sky, beasts, nature will mourn for him, and singers will sing to praise him.”

    These four lines of poetry became Botev's oath and his fighting call to future generations.

    Botev was a passionate defender of the people's revolution. He resolutely opposed the deceptive theories of the vulgar evolutionists of the time that "the Turkish regime would give the Bulgarian people political power" and that "science and culture could liberate the Bulgarian people," and wrote the poem "Patriot" to satirize and criticize them. He believed that the people's revolution was the "triumphal arch" of all nations and the only means to guarantee the attainment of "complete and absolute freedom for mankind." Botev was the spokesperson for the most revolutionary part of the Bulgarian people at that time—the constantly proletarianized petty bourgeoisie and revolutionary peasants. From an ideological point of view, he was a revolutionary democrat and utopian socialist. His greatness lies in his ability, under the historical conditions of the time, to see further than his contemporaries and point out the path that the people must take. Many of his political essays, even when read today, still give people a fresh and timeless feeling, full of a sense of reality. Therefore, he was not only a revolutionary democrat but also a pioneer of socialist thought in Bulgaria.

    Botev loved and was loyal to his country and people. He believed in the power of the people and their bright future, and he worked hard to learn from their wisdom and creativity. In his long poem "Parting," written in 1871, he expressed his infinite loyalty and unparalleled determination to the cause of the people's liberation: "…
    The troop sets out, goes away,
    The road is terrible, but glorious!
    I may sacrifice young…
    But only this praise is enough—
    One day the people will say:
    This poor man is for truth,
    Died for truth and for freedom..."

    Botev was extremely concerned about the unity of the revolutionary ranks. In the poem "A Dark Cloud Rose," he depicted the tragic end of two insurgent captains vying for revolutionary leadership with extreme sorrow, in order to educate the people that without the unity of the revolutionary ranks, there would be no revolutionary victory.

    Botev was a patriot, but he opposed any form of chauvinism. He did not want Bulgaria to gain any happiness at the expense of other peoples, and resolutely opposed the oppression of other peoples. He once clearly stipulated for the insurgents that ordinary Turkish residents must not "have their personality, property, and lives violated."

    Botev's patriotism was combined with internationalism. He respected the right of all peoples to exist and develop independently. He believed that it was possible to eliminate the exploiting classes and their governments that created hostility among the people and created injustice and poverty in society, and he closely linked the final liberation of the Bulgarian people with the liberation of all peoples. He once wrote: "Only a rational alliance of brotherhood among nations can eliminate human suffering, poverty, and parasites; only this alliance can create truth, freedom, fraternity, equality, and happiness on earth."

    Almost no struggle of the people against tyranny and enslavement at that time did not receive Botev's warm welcome and support. In 1871, in order to express his solidarity with the brothers of the Paris Commune, Botev wrote "The Creed of the Bulgarian Commune," expressing his socialist ideals.

    Botev possessed a thoughtful mind, tremendous emotional power, and strong will. His personality developed harmoniously: clear thinking, abundant strength, and profound insight were combined with a huge and rich imagination. These qualities were cultivated under the influence of his great ideals and his boundless love for the people. These qualities of Botev in turn gave a huge influence to the revolutionaries after him.

    Botev's creative activities were inseparable from his revolutionary activities. His poems, political essays, satirical sketches, and essays expressed his revolutionary thoughts with infinite passion and strength. In order to make it easier for the people to accept revolutionary principles, he widely used the forms of folk songs. His long poems "Parting" and "Haidut" were written in the form of folk songs, and they always feel kind and moving when read. In addition, he creatively used forms of expression that were popular with the people, such as riddles, maxims, proverbs, dream interpretation records, etc., to satirize the enemies of the people. His poems are not only full of fighting spirit and passion, but also extremely outstanding in artistic image, and have achieved a high degree of integrity and unity in terms of ideological and artistic qualities. His achievements raised Bulgarian literature to a new level. Even now, his poems are still the highest achievement in Bulgarian literature. His poems have been translated into dozens of languages and have become a dazzling pearl in the treasure house of world literature.

    Botev carried out a tenacious struggle to establish a new, revolutionary, and realistic literature and art. He believed that literature and art should serve the interests of the people and the people's struggle for a better life. He said: "Science, literature, and art must have a propaganda nature and must adapt to the people's lives, aspirations, and demands." He opposed the theories of "science for the sake of science" and "art for the sake of art." He defended the kind of literature that helps the people fight for freedom and social rights and enriches the people's knowledge.

    Botev's greatest appeal lies in the complete consistency of his words and deeds, and the complete consistency of literary activities and revolutionary practice. He realized his great ideal of dedicating his precious life to the cause of the liberation of the motherland with practical actions.

    The ideals of Botev and other Bulgarian revolutionary martyrs have been realized. The hardworking, brave, and revolutionary Bulgarian people, under the leadership of the Bulgarian Communist Party, have established a People's Republic and are now victoriously building a socialist society. Botev's poems have become a great force inspiring the Bulgarian people to fight for the construction of a socialist and communist society.

    Today, it is an exciting thing for the Chinese people to commemorate this great revolutionary and genius poet together with the fraternal Bulgarian people. This kind of commemoration is only possible when the people of both our countries have been liberated. The Chinese people will learn about the revolutionary struggle of the Bulgarian people and the achievements of Bulgarian classical literature from Botev's fighting life and his genius poems, and draw from them the inspiring power to fight for a better future.

    纪念保加利亚的伟大革命者和天才诗人保泰夫
    杨燕杰
    “在争取自由的战斗里倒下的人，永生不死，……”
                                  ——赫利斯多·保泰夫
    今年是保加利亚的伟大革命者和天才诗人赫利斯多·保泰夫壮烈牺牲的八十周年。保泰夫生活和创作的时代，正是保加利亚人民遭受土耳其五百年异族统治的最残酷的时代，同时也是保加利亚人民的革命解放斗争高涨的时代。保泰夫深刻地理解了他的时代所赋予他的任务，并且为了保加利亚人民的解放和进步献出了自己的全部力量和才华。
    赫利斯多·保泰夫于1848年12月25日（旧历）生在巴尔干山南麓的卡洛费尔城（现称保泰夫格拉德）。他的父亲波乔·彼得科夫是一个进步的人民教师。母亲依万卡·斯塔伊科娃是个贤慧的女子，能唱四百多首保加利亚民歌。保泰夫的父母热爱知识，关心人民的疾苦。保泰夫就是在这样的家庭环境里长大的。
    保泰夫在十五岁时，就被他的父亲送到俄国学习去了。他在敖德萨中学读书，并且同当地有革命思想的人建立了联系。因此，遭到了当时住在敖德萨的保加利亚贵族和沙皇地方当局的迫害，中途辍学离开俄国。
    俄国的革命民主主义者赫尔岑、别林斯基、车尔尼雪夫斯基等人的著作和保泰夫亲自观察和体验到的保加利亚人民所遭受的民族压迫和封建剥削的双重痛苦，奠定了保泰夫的革命思想。
    1868年春，保泰夫回到故乡，接替了父亲的工作，恢复了同保加利亚人民的联系。他开始在青年中展开了广泛的革命宣传活动，组织青年们学习射击和制造子弹，为将来的武装斗争作准备。
    在一次“基里尔和麦托迪节”（注）的纪念会上，许多官方人士讲过话以后，保泰夫忽然站出来向群众讲话。他痛斥了官方人士愚弄人民的演讲，并且号召人民为反对土耳其暴政进行斗争。这件事情触怒了土耳其地方当局。他的父亲怕他遭到迫害，于是又送他到俄国去学习。保泰夫路过罗马尼亚时，结识了许多保加利亚流亡者，并且在那里发现他可以为人民的事业献身，于是就留了下来。他在罗马尼亚做过印刷工人、教师和革命刊物的工作人员，并且同流亡的保加利亚爱国者在一起从事革命活动。流亡国外的艰苦生活，丝毫没有动摇他为人民服务的决心。
    保泰夫在罗马尼亚积极从事出版革命刊物的工作。1871年他开始出版：“保加利亚流亡者的话报”，他在报头上写了“真理是神圣的，自由是可贵的”两句话，以表示报纸的使命。他在这个报纸上发表了许多诗歌和政论。后来，他又创办了“闹钟报”（1873年）和“旗帜报”（1874年）。他所创办的报纸都成了保加利亚民族解放斗争的旗帜，在侨民中以至在国内都留下了巨大的影响。
    保泰夫不仅在思想战线上坚持不懈地进行斗争，而且还亲自参加实际的革命活动。他在团结流亡的保加利亚爱国者、招募和派遣起义队伍等工作中，都显示了他的组织和领导才能。他参加了保加利亚中央革命委员会。在1873年保加利亚的革命领袖瓦西里·列夫斯基被土耳其奴役者杀害了以后，保泰夫就成了保加利亚民族解放运动的领导者。
    1876年，在保加利亚爆发了光荣的反土耳其奴役的四月起义。保泰夫决定立刻回国参加起义，在同年5月20日（旧历），人数众多的起义队伍横渡多瑙河到了保加利亚岸的科兹洛杜伊村。这一天是保加利亚历史上最光荣的日子之一。正当队伍向着巴尔干山挺进时，保泰夫不幸在沃拉峰附近被土耳其的子弹击倒，结束了他的短暂而光辉的一生。
    保泰夫是为保加利亚的民族解放事业而牺牲的。他的战斗的一生为保加利亚人民留下了光辉而崇高的榜样，永远受到保加利亚人民的尊敬和纪念。每年6月2日，保加利亚青年都组织爬山队到保泰夫起义队伍殉难的地方——奥科尔奇查峰去悼念保泰夫，6月2日这一天已经成为保加利亚人民纪念为祖国的自由而倒下的先烈们的日子了。几乎保泰夫所有的诗都被谱成了歌曲，在人民中广泛流传。多少工厂、农庄、学校是以他的名字命名的！在反抗德国法西斯的战争中鼓舞并号召人民进行武装斗争的秘密电台就是以“赫利斯多·保泰夫”为名的。直到今天，索非亚电台的呼号还是“赫利斯多·保泰夫”。
    保泰夫是在二十八岁时牺牲的。他留给后人的诗歌只有二十首。但这些诗却是保加利亚文学中最宝贵的财产。他的生平和他的作品永远是鼓舞保加利亚人民为争取祖国的独立、自由和美好未来而斗争的伟大力量。有多少反法西斯战士和游击队员唱着保泰夫的诗歌而从容就义啊！
    “在争取自由的战斗里倒下的人，永生不死：大地，天空。猛兽、自然界都要为他哀悼，歌手们也要唱歌来赞扬他。”
    这四行诗成了保泰夫的誓词和他留给后人的战斗的号召。
    保泰夫是人民革命的热情捍卫者。他坚决反对当时的庸俗进化论者的“土耳其政权会给保加利亚人民以政治权力”、“科学和文化可以使保加利亚人民得到解放”的骗人理论，并且写了“爱国者”一诗来讽刺、抨击他们。他认为人民革命是各民族的“凯旋门”，是保证取得“人类的完全和绝对的自由”的唯一手段。保泰夫是当时保加利亚人民中最革命的一部分——不断无产阶级化的小资产阶级和革命的农民——的代言人。从思想观点上说，他是一个革命民主主义者和空想社会主义者。他的伟大在于他能在当时的历史条件下，比诸他的同时代的人看得更远，并且指出了人民必须走的道路。他的许多政论，即使现在读起来还会给人以清新隽永的感觉，充满着现实的气息。因此，他不只是一个革命的民主主义者，而且是保加利亚的社会主义思想的先驱。
    保泰夫热爱并且忠实于自己的国家和人民。他相信人民的力量和人民的光明未来，并且努力学习人民的智慧和创造精神。他在1871年写的长诗“离别”中，表达了他对人民解放事业的无限忠诚和无比决心：“……
    队伍出发了，开走了，
    路途是可怕的，但是光荣的！
    我可能年轻轻的牺牲……
    可是只有这个褒奖就够了——
    有一天人民说：
    这个苦命人是为真理，
    为真理也为自由而死去。……”
    保泰夫极度关心革命队伍的团结。在“升起了一片乌云”一诗中，他以极端沉痛的心情描绘了两个争夺革命领导权的起义队长的悲惨下场，用以教育人民：没有革命队伍的团结，就没有革命的胜利。
    保泰夫是个爱国者，但是他反对任何形式的沙文主义。他不希望保加利亚得到任何以牺牲别国人民为代价的幸福，坚决反对压迫别国人民。他曾经为起义者明确规定：对一般土耳其居民不得“侵犯他们的人格、财产和生命”。
    保泰夫的爱国主义是同国际主义结合在一起的。他尊重一切人民的生存和独立发展的权力。他认为消灭那些在人民之间制造仇视、在社会上制造不平和贫困的剥削阶级和它们的政府是可能的，他还把保加利亚人民的最后解放同各国人民的解放紧密地联系起来。他曾经写过：“只有各民族间的有理智的兄弟同盟才能消灭人类的苦难、贫困和寄生虫，只有这个同盟才能创造地球上的真理，自由、友爱、平等和幸福。”
    几乎没有一个当时的人民反抗暴政和奴役的斗争没有得到保泰夫的热烈欢迎和支持。1871年，保泰夫为了表示他同巴黎公社的弟兄们的团结一致，写了“保加利亚公社的信条”，表达了他的社会主义理想。
    保泰夫具有深谋远虑的头脑、巨大的感情力量和坚强的意志。他的个性是合谐地发展着的：思想明确、力量充沛和深刻的洞察力是同巨大而丰富的想像力结合在一起的。这些品质是在他的伟大的理想和对人民的无限热爱的影响下培养成的。保泰夫的这些品质又给了在他以后的革命者以巨大的影响。
    保泰夫的创作活动是同他的革命活动分不开的。他的诗歌、政论、讽刺小品和随笔，以无限的热情和力量表达了他的革命思想。为了使人民更容易接受革命的道理，他广泛运用了民歌的形式。他的长诗“离别”和“海杜特”就是用民歌的形式写的，读起来永远感到亲切动人。此外，他还创造性地运用了为人民喜闻乐见的表现形式，如谜语、格言、谚语、解梦录等来讽刺人民的敌人。他的诗歌不但充满了战斗精神和热情，而且在艺术形象上也是极其出色的，在思想性和艺术性上达到了高度的完整和统一。他的造诣把保加利亚的文学提到了新的水平。直到现在，他的诗歌在保加利亚文学上还是最高的成就。他的诗歌已经被译成几十种文字，成为世界文学宝库中的一颗光彩夺目的珍珠。
    保泰夫为建立新的、革命的和现实主义的文艺而进行了顽强的斗争。他认为文艺应当为人民的利益、为人民争取美好的生活服务。他说：“科学、文学和艺术必须具有宣传的性质，必须适应人民的生活、渴望和要求。”他反对“为科学而科学”“为艺术而艺术”的理论。他维护那种帮助人民争取自由和社会权利、丰富人民的知识的文学。
    保泰夫最大的感召力量在于他的言行完全一致，文学活动和革命实践的完全一致。他用实际行动实现了把自己的宝贵生命献给祖国的解放事业的伟大理想。
    保泰夫和其他保加利亚革命烈士们的理想实现了。勤劳勇敢、富有革命传统的保加利亚人民在保加利亚共产党的领导下，已经建立了人民共和国，现在正胜利地建设着社会主义社会，保泰夫的诗歌又成了鼓舞保加利亚人民为建成社会主义和共产主义社会而斗争的伟大力量。
    今天，中国人民和兄弟的保加利亚人民一道纪念这位伟大的革命者和天才诗人，是件令人兴奋的事情。只有在我们两国人民都获得了解放的时候，这种纪念才有可能。中国人民将要从保泰夫的战斗的一生和他的天才诗篇中了解保加利亚人民的革命斗争和保加利亚古典文学的成就，并且从中汲取为争取更美好的未来而斗争的鼓舞力量。
