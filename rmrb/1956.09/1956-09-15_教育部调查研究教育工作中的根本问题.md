Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The Ministry of Education has decided to spend approximately six months conducting in-depth research and resolving several fundamental problems currently existing in general education and teacher training.

In early September, the first four investigation teams, led by heads of various departments of the Ministry of Education, have already departed for Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Jilin, Shanxi, Tianjin and other provinces and cities. They will primarily focus on investigating and researching the understanding and implementation of the policy of all-round development in education, improving the teaching plans of primary and secondary schools, teacher training schools, and spare-time schools, overcoming the phenomenon of teachers being overwhelmed, and the contradiction between quantity and quality in the development of education.

The Ministry of Education will also dispatch investigation teams and organize research teams within the Ministry to conduct investigations and research on the implementation of basic production technology education, improvement of teaching materials, resolution of teachers' professional development, living welfare, improvement of students' burdens and health, elimination of illiteracy and popularization of compulsory education, and improvement of leadership.

Local educational administrative departments will also include the study of these issues in their work plans for the next six months.

This investigation and research work will prepare for the National Education Administration Conference to be held in the first quarter of next year.
