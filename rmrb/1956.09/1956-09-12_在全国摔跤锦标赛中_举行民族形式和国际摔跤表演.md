Xinhua News Agency, 11th: More than two thousand Beijing spectators today welcomed athletes from various ethnic groups with warm applause at the 1956 National Wrestling Championships, where various ethnic and international wrestling performances were held.

    Eight burly Mongolian wrestlers today performed Mongolian wrestling, as practiced at the annual Naadam festivals. Dressed in leather wrestling jackets, trousers, and boots, they competed in pairs in a single-elimination tournament. During the wrestling, leg holds were not allowed, and there was no time limit. Being thrown once resulted in elimination.

    In today's exhibition match, Adiya (95 kg), the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region's wrestling runner-up, and Sedeng (80 kg), the 1953 national light heavyweight wrestling champion, qualified for the final. Adiya had previously thrown Jirichengla (120 kg, third place in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region) during the elimination round, but shortly after the start of the final, he was thrown to the ground by the skillful Sedeng.

    Korean athletes Jin Binglie and Chi Changxun performed Korean wrestling, in which each wrestler ties one arm to the opponent's leg with two belts. The wrestling begins from a kneeling position. In their best-of-three exhibition match, Chi Changxun emerged victorious.

    The wrestling performances by athletes from the A'xi and Hani ethnic groups of Yunnan Province were somewhat similar to international wrestling styles. A wrestler was considered defeated only when their entire back was pinned to the mat by the opponent. Therefore, they often used their heads and necks to support their backs to prevent the opponent from pressing them down.

    Classical wrestling (leg holds not allowed) and freestyle wrestling (leg holds allowed), both popular international styles, performed by athletes from the Beijing Sports Institute, were also warmly welcomed by the audience. (Photo attached)

    在全国摔跤锦标赛中
    举行民族形式和国际摔跤表演
    新华社11日讯  两千多名北京市观众今天用热烈鼓掌欢迎各民族运动员在1956年全国摔跤锦标赛中举行的各种民族形式和国际摔跤表演。
    八名身材魁伟的蒙古族摔跤选手，今天表演了他们在历届那达慕大会上举行的蒙古族摔跤。他们身穿皮摔跤衣、长裤和皮靴，两个人一对先举行淘汰赛。他们摔的时候不许抱腿，也不受时间限制，被摔倒一次，就被淘汰。
    在今天的表演赛中，内蒙古自治区的摔跤亚军、二十二岁的阿迪雅（体重九十五公斤）和1953年次重量级摔跤全国冠军色登（体重八十公斤）获得了决赛权。阿迪雅在淘汰赛时曾经摔倒了体重有一百二十公斤的、三十四岁的吉尔成拉（内蒙古自治区的第三名），但是他在决赛开始后不久，却被有良好技巧的色登摔倒在地上。
    朝鲜族运动员金秉烈和池昌勋表演的朝鲜族摔跤，用两根带子各把自己的一只胳膊同对方的一条腿套在一起，摔的时候是从跪着的姿势开始的。他们在三赛两胜制的表演赛中，池昌勋获得胜利。
    来自云南省的阿细族和哈尼族运动员的摔跤表演，有些像国际摔跤形式，被摔倒的运动员必须背部全被对方按在垫子上才算失败，因此他们通常都是用头和脖子来支撑着后背，不使对方压下去。
    北京体育学院运动员表演的国际流行的古典式摔跤（不许抱腿）和自由式摔跤（可以抱腿），也受到观众热烈欢迎。（附图片）
