Comrades,

    On behalf of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, I extend my congratulations to the true representatives of New China. At the same time, I want to emphasize that our Party Central Committee is very pleased to accept the invitation from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to send representatives to attend this congress.

    Our Party Central Committee and our Party leader, Comrade Tito, deeply admire the struggle of the Communist Party of China against imperialism and domestic counter-revolutionary forces, and the great armed struggle of the Chinese people. This struggle has inspired and filled with enthusiasm the progressive forces of the world. Our country and our working people are extremely concerned about and studying the efforts made and the experiences gained by the Chinese people in establishing socialist social relations and building a great socialist China.

    The struggle waged by the Chinese people under the leadership of their Party and Comrade Mao Zedong has produced great and historically significant achievements. World imperialism has suffered a serious blow in its weakest point. The struggle of the people of oppressed countries for freedom and independence has thus received strong support. After the elimination of domestic counter-revolutionary forces, the road to a better life—the road to socialism—has unfolded before the Chinese people. All this has strengthened the forces of world socialism and promoted their struggle for progress. This has brought new experiences and enriched the theoretical thinking and revolutionary practice of the international working-class movement.

    The Communist Party of China has been victorious despite experiencing all kinds of difficulties. This is because it has correctly applied the doctrine of Marxism-Leninism under specific struggle conditions and found its own path to victory. Such a great party has provided many new things that must be valued and that also belong to the working-class movement of other countries.

    We Yugoslav Communists have utilized China's experience in armed struggle, especially in guerrilla warfare. It was the Chinese revolution that demonstrated that guerrilla warfare is not a desperate action in the face of a much stronger enemy, nor an armed struggle with often insufficient contact between each other and no hope of converging into a strong unified struggle to finally defeat the enemy. The revolutions in China and our country have shown that, under specific domestic and international conditions, armed struggle through guerrilla warfare is the only possible way to achieve victory.

    Despite the events that recently occurred in the international working-class movement, the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and the Yugoslav state have consistently valued the great significance of the victory of the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people, and have given full support. We have consistently advocated recognizing the status of New China in the world, supporting the admission of New China to the United Nations, and supporting the Chinese people's right to Taiwan in all international forums. New Yugoslavia has advocated, in the past and at present, lifting the economic and political pressure of certain Western countries on China.

    Our Central Committee and our people are deeply convinced that the relations between our two countries and between our two parties will continue to develop and strengthen.

    Your Central Committee's report points out the tremendous achievements of your country in economic construction and in developing new forms of socialist democracy. These reports illustrate the scale to which the socialist material forces in urban and rural areas have developed. The reports also talk about the special path of China's socialist development and the special conditions that you possess and that your party must take into account. We understand that these concrete characteristics have played a role, in a certain sense, as a lever in China's socialist development, and they will undoubtedly accelerate the process of transforming Chinese society on a socialist basis.

    There has been much discussion within the parties of various countries about the special paths of socialist development and about the question of the working class seizing power. The 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union was also of great significance in this respect, because it dealt with this issue in accordance with Leninist principles, pointing out that the paths of the working-class movement and socialist development in various countries are diverse. This is a great step forward. The working-class movement in various countries has become more vigorous and more practical, and its struggle has become more connected to certain specific historical conditions, and to the lives of its own countries and people. Recognizing the existence of this special path is a manifestation of the strength of proletarian internationalism and provides a solid foundation for proletarian internationalism, because this internationalism is built simultaneously on the general and special developments and characteristics of the international working-class movement, on the doctrine of Marxism-Leninism, on the great experience accumulated so far in the struggle for socialism, and on the special conditions of the struggle in various countries.

    If this were not the case, socialism would stagnate. The strength of socialism lies precisely in its ability to constantly discover new things, further develop our theoretical thinking, and discover new forms of struggle for seizing power and new forms of socialist democracy. New things will be encountered in concrete struggles and creative efforts. Within our great socialist movement, as long as everyone is working towards the common goal of achieving socialism, and has different opinions on certain issues after reflection, this will only increase the strength of our movement.

    As we all know, world relations have undergone tremendous changes since World War II. Before that, there was only one socialist country, the Soviet Union, and it was surrounded by the capitalist world. With the victory of democratic and socialist forces in China, Yugoslavia, and some other countries, with the liberation of the people of India, Burma, Indonesia, and other countries from the shackles of imperialism, and with the unfolding of the persistent struggle of the people of colonial and semi-colonial countries for freedom and independence, and with the growth of democratic and socialist forces in various countries, new relations have been formed in the world, and the strength of the imperialist reactionaries has been greatly weakened. These new relations have placed, and are placing, many new demands on the international working-class movement, requiring new things in the strategy and tactics of the struggle for seizing power, socialist construction, and international relations. This new relationship has also opened up and is opening up new avenues, which are conducive to the struggle of progressive forces for peace and the construction of socialist and democratic new social systems.

    The Communist Party of Yugoslavia has experienced years of arduous struggle and achieved brilliant victories on the road of the working class and working people seizing power and building socialism. The Yugoslav communists have overcome all these difficulties because they are loyal to the doctrine of Marxism-Leninism, because they are revolutionaries who forge ahead bravely, and firmly believe in the correctness of this doctrine and its inevitable victory.

    Our Party once called on the Yugoslav people to wage an armed struggle against German and Italian imperialism and its vassal states, to defend our independence, and to fight for the establishment of a new, socialist Yugoslavia. It did so also because this was its responsibility to the first socialist country, the Soviet Union, and the great October Socialist Revolution. In this way, the Yugoslav communists did their best to defend the interests of their motherland and its working people, and faithfully fulfilled their responsibility to proletarian internationalism. These two things enabled our people to pass through arduous tests, endure heavy sacrifices, and achieve victory.

    Our Party starts from the specific circumstances of our country and the new relations that have arisen since World War II—the rapid growth of socialist and democratic forces being a reflection of these new relations—to solve the problems of socialist construction in our country and the status of New Yugoslavia in the world.

    In terms of domestic development, we have used the Soviet Union's experience in establishing socialist social relations. However, our Party believes that it is also necessary to seek new paths and new possibilities for building a new society under new conditions, based on the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism and starting from the specific circumstances of Yugoslavia.

    The classic authors of Marxism-Leninism—Marx, Engels, and Lenin, especially Lenin—warned against the danger of bureaucracy in the early stages of socialist social development. They pointed out that bureaucracy shackles people's freedom and the initiative of the working people, and will become an obstacle to the development of material forces. Lenin also pointed out some ways to prevent bureaucracy from occurring and to fully unleash the socialist initiative of the masses.

    In our practice of socialist construction in Yugoslavia, we quickly realized that the strict centralization of management in the economy, the state, culture, education, and other aspects of life produced bureaucracy, which attempted to become the supreme master of our entire national life. Under the oppression of bureaucracy, the people, though disagreeing, had to bow their heads and endure it, and finally became mechanical executors of the will of the supreme authority, the bureaucracy and its institutions.

    The principle on which our Party bases its struggle against bureaucracy is to promote socialist democracy through social self-government in all aspects of social life. Our Party believes that this is the main weapon for combating bureaucracy and a guarantee for unleashing the initiative of the working people. The freedom and free initiative of the people should first be brought into play in material production, so that the people themselves can manage production. Therefore, our country organized workers' councils. Under certain conditions, workers' councils directly manage the social means of production. Before long, the workers' councils became a huge social force in our country. Social self-government institutions have also been widely established in science, culture, health, social welfare, etc., and millions of people decide all the issues that need to be considered through these institutions. The task of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and the Socialist Alliance of the Working People of Yugoslavia, which has millions of members, is to enable the working people to participate in these institutions as actively as possible, because these institutions have become a reality in our country, and whether the work is done well depends to a large extent on the activities of these institutions. Social plans—in the form of laws—stipulate and determine the basic proportions of our country's economic and social development, and the workers' collectives, millions of workers, who are concerned about the fate of these plans, struggle selflessly for the overfulfillment of the provisions of these plans under material encouragement.

    We Yugoslav communists believe that this path is correct because it has been proven by practice, and we believe that if we want to establish genuine socialist relations between people, and to enable the productive forces to develop correctly and rapidly, this form of democratic government should be further developed.

    As everyone knows, our socialist country was in a special position internationally for several years. But it was precisely during this period that it launched extensive international activities, resolutely defended peace, and advocated peaceful coexistence. Based on these principles, our country has established friendly relations with many countries and strengthened friendly relations with the people of all countries striving for peace, freedom, and independence. We believe that this has made no small contribution to the cause of peace and international cooperation and has strengthened the progressive forces in the world, which our government has been striving for for many years.

    We believe that maintaining practical contact and exchanging views with socialist parties and other movements is also beneficial to the cause of progressive forces in the world. This contact is conducive to clarifying many issues with each other and helps to better understand the specific policies adopted by various parties and movements—movements that hope to cooperate, are willing to work for peace and peaceful coexistence, and are striving for the peaceful resolution of international problems and the establishment of relations between countries on an equal footing.

    Finally, I would like to emphasize that we Yugoslav communists and the people of all ethnic groups in our country will be overjoyed at every future achievement of the Communist Party of China, because this will strengthen peace, democracy, and socialism throughout the world.

    Long live the great Communist Party of China!

    Long live the Chinese people, the warriors defending peace and building socialism!

    Long live the cooperation and lasting friendship between the Chinese and Yugoslav peoples!

    Long live socialism!

专栏：

    南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟代表团团长维塞林诺夫同志致词同志们：
    我代表南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟向新中国的真正的代表致贺，同时，我要着重指出，我们党中央委员会十分高兴地接受中国共产党中央委员会的邀请，派代表前来参加这次大会。
    我们党中央委员会和我们党的领袖铁托同志非常敬佩中国共产党反对帝国主义和国内反革命势力的斗争，中国人民的伟大的武装斗争。这一斗争曾经鼓舞了全世界的进步力量，并且使它们充满了热情。我们国家和我国劳动人民极其关心地注视和研究中国人民目前在建立社会主义的社会关系，在建设伟大的社会主义的中国方面所作的努力和取得的经验。
    中国人民在他们的党和毛泽东同志的领导下进行的斗争已经产生了伟大的有历史意义的成就。世界帝国主义已经在最脆弱的地方受到了严重的打击。被压迫国家的人民争取自由和独立的斗争从而得到了有力的支持。在国内反革命势力被消灭以后，中国人民的面前展开了走向美好的生活——走向社会主义的道路。这一切都加强了世界社会主义的力量，促进了它们为了向前发展而进行的斗争。这就取得了新的经验，丰富了国际工人阶级运动的理论思想和革命实践。
    中国共产党曾经经历过各种各样的困难而一直是胜利的，这是由于它在具体的斗争条件下正确地运用了马克思列宁主义的学说，找到了它自己的走向胜利的道路。像这样一个伟大的党，提供了许多必须重视的、也是属于其他国家的工人阶级运动的新的东西。
    我们南斯拉夫共产主义者曾经利用了中国在武装斗争，特别是在游击战争方面的经验。正是中国革命说明了，游击战争并不是在强大得多的敌人面前作拼死的行动，也不是在相互之间常常没有充分联系、而且没有希望汇合成为一个强大统一的斗争而最后打败敌人的一种武装斗争。中国的革命和我国的革命都说明，在特定的国内和国际条件下，通过游击战争进行的武装斗争，是唯一可能的取得胜利的办法。
    尽管有在不久以前国际工人阶级运动中发生的事件，南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟和南斯拉夫国家还是一直重视中国共产党和中国人民的胜利的重大意义，而且给予全力的支持。我们在一切国际讲台上都一直主张承认新中国在世界上的地位，支持接纳新中国进入联合国，支持中国人民对台湾的权利。新南斯拉夫在过去和现在都主张解除某些西方国家对中国的经济和政治的压力。
    我们的中央委员会和我国人民深信，我们两国之间的关系和我们两党之间的关系将继续发展和加强。
    你们中央委员会的报告指出了你们国家在经济建设方面的巨大成就，和在发展社会主义民主政府新形式方面的巨大成就。这些报告向我们说明，城乡社会主义物质力量已经发展到了什么规模。这些报告也谈到了中国社会主义发展的特殊的道路，谈到了你们所具有的、你们的党所必须加以考虑的特殊的条件。我们了解，这些具体的特点在某种意义上已经在中国社会主义发展中起了杠杆的作用，它们无疑地会加速中国社会在社会主义基础上进行改造的过程。
    在各国党内，关于社会主义发展的特殊道路和关于工人阶级夺取政权的问题已经有过很多的讨论。苏联共产党第二十次代表大会也是在这方面有重大的意义，因为它本着列宁主义的原则处理了这个问题，指出各国工人阶级运动和社会主义的发展的道路是多种多样的。这是一个巨大的进步，各国工人阶级运动变得更加生气勃勃了，更加实际了，它的斗争变得同一定的具体的历史条件，同自己的国家和人民的生活更加有联系了。承认这种特殊的道路的存在，是无产阶级国际主义的力量的表现，并且为无产阶级国际主义提供了一个稳固的基础，因为这种国际主义是同时建筑在国际工人阶级运动的一般的和特殊的发展和特点上的，是建筑在马克思列宁主义的学说上的、建筑在直到现在在争取社会主义的斗争中积累起来的伟大的经验上、在各国斗争的特殊条件上的。
    如果不是这样，社会主义就会陷于停滞。社会主义的力量恰恰在于，能够不断地发现新鲜事物，进一步发展我们的理论思想，发现夺取政权的斗争的新形式和社会主义民主制度的新形式。在具体的斗争和创造性的努力中会遇到新的东西。在我们伟大的社会主义运动内部，只要大家都是为了达到社会主义这一共同目标，经过思考而对某些问题具有不同的意见，这只会增加我们运动的力量。
    我们大家都知道，第二次世界大战以来，世界关系发生了巨大的变化。在那以前，只有苏联一个社会主义国家，并且处在资本主义世界的包围中。随着民主和社会主义力量在中国、南斯拉夫和其他一些国家的胜利，随着印度、缅甸、印度尼西亚和其他国家的人民从帝国主义枷锁之下获得解放，以及殖民地、半殖民地人民展开争取自由和独立的持久的斗争，随着民主和社会主义力量在各国的增长，世界上形成了新的关系，帝国主义反动派的力量大大地削弱了。这种新的关系，过去和现在都对国际工人阶级运动提出了许多新的要求，在夺取政权的斗争中的战略和策略、社会主义的建设以及国际关系方面都需要有新的东西。这一新的关系也已经开辟和正在开辟新的道路，而有利于进步力量争取和平和建设社会主义的、民主的新社会制度的斗争。
    南斯拉夫共产党在工人阶级和劳动人民夺取政权和建设社会主义的道路上，曾经经历过艰苦斗争的年代，得到过辉煌的胜利。南斯拉夫共产主义者克服了这一切困难，是因为他们忠实于马克思列宁主义的学说，因为他们是勇往直前的革命者，深信这一学说的正确和必将取得胜利。
    我们的党曾经号召南斯拉夫人民对德、意帝国主义及其附庸国进行武装斗争，保卫我们的独立，为建立新的、社会主义的南斯拉夫而斗争。它这样做，同时也因为这是它对第一个社会主义国家苏联和伟大的十月社会主义革命的责任。这样，南斯拉夫共产主义者尽其所能地保卫了他们祖国及其劳动人民的利益，而且忠实地履行了他们对无产阶级国际主义的责任。这两者使我们人民通过了艰苦的考验，经受了沉重的牺牲而取得胜利。
    我们党是从我们国家的具体情况和第二次世界大战后产生的新关系出发——社会主义和民主力量迅速增长就是这种新关系的反映——来解决我国的社会主义建设问题和新南斯拉夫在世界上的地位的问题的。
    在国内的发展方面，我们运用了苏联建立社会主义社会关系的经验。但是，我们党认为也必须根据马克思列宁主义学说的基本原理和从南斯拉夫的具体情况出发，在新的条件下寻求建设新社会的新道路和新的可能性。
    马克思列宁主义的经典作者——马克思、恩格斯和列宁，特别是列宁，曾经提出警告，要在社会主义社会发展的初期防备官僚主义的危险。他们指出，官僚主义束缚人的自由和劳动人民的积极性，是会成为物质力量发展的障碍的。列宁也曾经指出了防止官僚主义发生，充分发挥群众的社会主义积极性的某些方式。
    在我们南斯拉夫进行社会主义建设的实践中，我们很快就体会到，在经济、国家、文化、教育和生活的其他方面实行严格的集中管理，产生了官僚主义，这种官僚主义企图成为我们整个国家生活的无上主宰。在官僚主义的压制下，人民虽不赞同但只好低头忍受，终于成为无上权威的官僚主义及其机构的意志的机械的执行者。
    我们党在反对官僚主义的斗争中所根据的原则，是通过社会生活各方面的社会自治来发扬社会主义的民主。我们党认为这是对官僚主义进行斗争的主要武器，是发挥劳动人民主动性的保证。人民的自由和自由的主动性首先应当在物质生产方面去发挥，以便由人民自己来管理生产。因此，我国组织了工人委员会。工人委员会在一定的条件下直接管理社会生产手段。没有多久，工人委员会就成了我国一支巨大的社会力量。在科学、文化、卫生、社会福利等等方面也普遍设立了社会自治机构，千千万万的人民通过这些机构决定一切需要考虑的问题。南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟和拥有几百万盟员的南斯拉夫劳动人民社会主义联盟的任务就是使劳动人民尽可能积极参加这些机构，因为这些机构已经成为我国的现实，工作是否做得好，在极大的程度上取决于这些机构的活动。社会计划——以法律的形式——规定和决定我国经济和社会发展的基本比例，而关心这些计划的命运的就是这些工人的集体，千百万的工人，在物质的鼓励下，以自我牺牲的精神为超额完成这些计划的规定而奋斗。
    我们南斯拉夫共产主义者认为，这条道路是正确的，因为它已经得到实践的证明，而且我们认为如果我们要建立人与人之间的真正的社会主义关系，要使得生产力得到正确而迅速的发展，这种民主的政府形式，应当进一步发展。
    大家知道，我们的社会主义国家有好几年在国际上处于一种特殊的地位。但是恰恰是在这个时期，它展开了广泛的国际活动，坚决维护和平，主张和平共处。我们国家根据这些原则，同许多国家建立了友好关系，加强了同争取和平、自由和独立的各国人民的友好关系。我们认为，这对和平事业和国际合作作出了不少的贡献，并且加强了世界上的进步力量，这是我国政府多年来一直为之而奋斗的。
    我们认为，同社会党以及其他运动也保持实际的联系和交换意见，对于世界上的进步力量的事业是有好处的。这种接触有利于互相澄清许多问题，有助于更好地了解各党和各个运动——希望进行合作，愿意为和平与和平共处而努力，为和平解决国际问题和各国人民在平等的基础上建立关系而努力的各种运动所采取的具体政策。
    最后，我愿意强调指出，我们南斯拉夫共产主义者和我国各族人民对于中国共产党今后每一个成就都会感到欢欣鼓舞，因为这会加强全世界的和平、民主和社会主义。
    伟大的中国共产党万岁！
    保卫和平和建设社会主义的战士——中国人民万岁！
    中国人民和南斯拉夫人民之间的合作和持久友谊万岁！
    社会主义万岁！
