    Sending an Umbrella After the Rain
    Yin Hong

    In mid-July, it was the hottest season in the Jiangnan region in a century. At this time, the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Finance issued a notice on supplementary payments for winter heating subsidies for 1955. The name of this payment was "Winter Heating Subsidy," but there was no "subsidy" when "heating" was needed in the cold winter. Only in the blazing summer, when "the scorching sun is like fire," was a notice issued preparing for the "subsidy." At that time, the temperature in many parts of Zhejiang was around one hundred degrees, so who needed "heating"?

    In late August, the weather gradually cooled. The Zhejiang Provincial Department of Finance issued another notice stating that, because the weather was too hot, the expenses required by various agencies for making cooling drinks could be reimbursed. Some recipient agencies did not receive a notice that they could "make cooling drinks" when the "weather was too hot," so how can they "reimburse" now?

    After the rain has stopped and the sky has cleared, giving an umbrella to someone who has already been rained on is a kind gesture, but it always feels too late. These two notices from the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Finance are precisely examples of "sending an umbrella after the rain."

    雨后送伞
    印鸿
    7月中旬，正是江南地区百年未有的炎热季节。这时，浙江省财政厅发出了关于补发1955年冬季取暖补贴的通知。这笔款项的名称叫做“冬季取暖补贴”，可是，在寒冬里需要“取暖”的时候没有“补贴”，直到“赤日炎炎似火烧”的盛夏，才发出通知准备“补贴”。当时，浙江许多地方的温度都在一百度左右，谁还需要“取暖”呢？
    8月下旬，天气渐渐凉爽了。浙江省财政厅又发出一份通知，里面说，因天气过热，各机关制作清凉饮料所需的经费可以报销。有些受文的机关，在“天气过热”的时候并没有接到可以“制作清凉饮料”的通知，现在怎样“报销”呢？
    雨过天晴之后，将雨伞送给曾经淋雨的人，虽属一片好心，总觉为时已晚。浙江省财政厅的这两个通知，正是属于“雨后送伞”之例。
