Xinhua News Agency, September 14th dispatch from Washington: U.S. Secretary of State Dulles defended the Anglo-French-American proposal to establish a Suez Canal "User Association" to seize control of the canal at a press conference on September 13th.

Dulles made it clear that the purpose of establishing such an organization was to exert collective pressure on Egypt.

He also admitted that "Washington has given extremely deep consideration to this plan" and "conducted very close cooperation on this issue with the British and French governments through the British and French ambassadors."

Dulles attempted to deny the Egyptian accusation that the plan was a provocative act. He tried hard to argue that the plan was "an attempt to solve the problem of getting ships through the canal on a practical, day-to-day working basis." He repeated his previously expressed argument that the Suez problem could not be solved because of the great principles put forward on this issue, such as "sovereignty," "dignity," "majesty," and "East versus West." He advocated setting aside these things and treating the canal issue as a "practical" matter.

A reporter asked Dulles if there were any other peaceful alternatives if Egypt rejected the "User Association" plan. Dulles said that, as far as the United States was concerned, our alternative would at least be to have our ships go around the Cape of Good Hope.

The reporter then asked if the United States hoped that other countries would also take this approach and not use force. Dulles quoted Eisenhower as saying, "Force, if justified, can only be justified as a last resort."

Dulles indicated that the United States had already prepared for ships to go around the Cape of Good Hope. He said, "A number of oil tankers belonging to the Maritime Administration and the Military Sea Transportation Service reserve fleet now listed in the reserve are about to be taken out of the reserve. This decision has been made." At the same time, he stated that, given the increased financial burden that ships going around the Cape of Good Hope would place on some countries, the U.S. government was willing to consider granting "dollar loans" to friendly countries that might not be able to afford it. Dulles also said that if the canal were to cease navigation, "then a very heavy burden would fall on other ships that were going to pass through the canal. This burden will mainly fall on Asian countries, not European countries."

A reporter asked Dulles to explain why he verbally said that he did not approve of an organized boycott of the canal, but at the same time was carrying out a plan that was in effect a boycott of the canal. Dulles replied: "I don't consider avoiding the use of force to forcibly pass through the canal to be a boycott. We don't want to use force to forcibly pass through the canal. We may have the right to do so, but as far as the United States is concerned, we don't want to do so. If we encounter force that can only be subdued by shooting, we don't want to do that shooting. At that time, we would like to have our ships go around the Cape of Good Hope."

When Dulles spoke of whether the United States' participation in the canal "User Association" would depend on whether the association members were more than just Britain and France, he said that if no other countries were willing to endorse the plan, "we would proceed as a three-nation proposal." He also expressed the hope that the work of organizing the "User Association" would be able to "proceed vigorously" by next week.

    杜勒斯公开抹煞埃及对运河的主权
    承认“使用国协会”计划是集体劫掠
    扬言美国准备绕道好望角并为武力政策辩护
    据新华社14日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务卿杜勒斯在9月13日的记者招待会上为英法美三国关于成立苏彝士运河“使用国协会”以夺取运河控制权的主张进行辩护。
    杜勒斯明白表示，成立这样一个组织是为了向埃及施加集体压力。
    他还承认“华盛顿曾对这个计划给予了极为深刻的考虑”，并“通过英国和法国大使同英法两国政府在这个问题上进行了非常密切的合作。”
    杜勒斯企图否认埃及方面所提出的关于这个计划是一种挑衅行为的指责，他竭力辩解，这个计划是“设法在一种实际的逐日工作的基础上解决使船只通过运河的问题”。他重复他曾经发表过的论调说，苏彝士问题之所以不能解决，是因为在这个问题上提出了例如“主权”、“庄严”、“威严”和“东方对西方”等等大道理。他主张撇开这些而把运河问题当作一个“实际工作”的问题来处理。
    有记者问杜勒斯，如果埃及拒绝“使用国协会”计划，还有没有其他和平的代替方法。杜勒斯说，就美国来说，我们的代替办法至少就是让我们的船只绕行好望角。
    记者接着问，美国是否希望其他国家也采取这样的作法而不使用武力？杜勒斯引用艾森豪威尔的话回答说，“武力，如果是正当的话，也只能在作为最后手段的时候才是正当的”。
    杜勒斯表示，美国已经为船只绕行好望角作了准备。他说，“现在列入后备役的海事局和军用海运处后备舰队所属的若干油船，即将调出后备役。这一决定已经采取了。”他同时表示，鉴于船只绕行好望角会增加一些国家的财政负担，美国政府愿意考虑给予那些可能负担不起的友好国家以“美元贷款”。杜勒斯又说，如果发生了运河停止通航的情况，“那么一个十分沉重的负担就会落在将要通过运河的其他船只上。这负担主要将落在亚洲国家身上，而不是欧洲国家身上。”
    有记者要杜勒斯说明为什么他口头上说不赞同对运河进行有组织的抵制，可是同时又在进行着实际上就是抵制运河的计划。杜勒斯回答说：“我不认为避免使用武力强行通过运河是一种抵制。我们不想用武力强行通过运河。我们可能有权这样作，可是就美国而论，我们是不想这样作的。如果我们碰上了只有用射击办法才能制服的武力，我们不想进行这种射击。那时，我们想使我们的船只绕过好望角。”
    杜勒斯在谈到美国参加运河“使用国协会”是否要看协会成员不止是英国和法国时说，如果没有其他国家愿意赞同这个计划，“我们就作为三国的建议进行”。他还表示希望组织“使用国协会”的工作到下星期就能够“大力进行”。
