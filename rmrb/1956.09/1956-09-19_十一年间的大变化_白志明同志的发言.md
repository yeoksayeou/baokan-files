    Great Changes in Eleven Years
    Speech by Comrade Bai Zhiming
    Congratulations from the People of Northern Shaanxi
    I come to participate in this conference with the sincere expectations and heartfelt congratulations of the Party members and people of Yan'an and Northern Shaanxi for the Eighth National Congress of the Party, and with their deep remembrance and boundless love for the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. I feel indescribably excited and happy. When the news of the convening of the Eighth National Congress of the Party arrived, the Party members and people of Yan'an and Northern Shaanxi recalled the enormous changes that had taken place in the eleven years between the Seventh and Eighth Congresses, and their hearts were filled with infinite joy. As Comrade Cai Weiyuan, a member of the July 1st Agricultural Cooperative in Yangjialing, said: "When the Seventh Congress was held in Yan'an, Japanese imperialism had not yet surrendered, and the Kuomintang reactionaries had not yet collapsed. Now, we are building a socialist society, and Yan'an has also achieved agricultural cooperativization this year, and we have begun to have tractors. We must do a good job in agricultural production to support industrial construction to celebrate the convening of the Eighth Congress." These words fully express the excited mood of the Party members and people of Yan'an and Northern Shaanxi.
        From Victory to Victory
    After the Seventh Congress, just as the people of Yan'an and Northern Shaanxi were living a happy life of abundance under the direct leadership of the Party Central Committee, Hu Zongnan's bandit troops launched an attack on Yan'an, the seat of the Party Central Committee. The people of Yan'an and Northern Shaanxi shouted the slogans "Defend the Party Central Committee!" and "Defend Chairman Mao!" and waged a heroic struggle against the enemy, actively cooperating with the People's Liberation Army in combat in all aspects, and finally won the victory of the war and recovered Yan'an. During the war, Yan'an and Northern Shaanxi suffered severely from the destruction caused by Hu Zongnan's bandit troops. For example, thirty-seven villages in the suburbs of Yan'an became uninhabited areas, more than 40 percent of the cultivated land was barren, and livestock decreased by 70 percent. After the recovery of Yan'an, in Zaoyuan Village, where Chairman Mao lived, forty-five households of farmers who had fled and returned brought back only eight cows and twenty sheep. They settled down in dilapidated cave dwellings and cultivated the barren land almost empty-handed. Although the enemy's looting and destruction caused many difficulties in the post-war recovery work, and most areas were hit by natural disasters last year, the people of Yan'an and Northern Shaanxi did not bow their heads to any difficulties. Under the close care of the Party Central Committee, the allocation of huge amounts of grain and funds by the State Council, and the strong support of all parts of the country, they overcame numerous difficulties with their own labor and wisdom, healed the wounds of war, overcame the disasters, and restored and developed production.
    Through a series of social reforms in recent years, especially the realization of agricultural cooperativization, a broad road has been opened for further development of production. According to a survey of three agricultural cooperatives in the suburbs of Yan'an City, the per-mu yield of grain this year has more than doubled compared with 1946 before the Kuomintang army attacked. The wheat yield on the mountainous land of the Yanglaozhuang Agricultural Cooperative has increased from 50 or 60 jin per mu in the past to more than 220 jin, and large-scale high yields have reached 400 jin. The agricultural tax has been reduced by half compared with 1946. With the recovery and development of production and the reduction of agricultural taxes, people's lives have been gradually improved, and social purchasing power has continued to grow. In particular, the supply of industrial products is sufficient and the prices are reasonable. For example, before 1948, four dou of millet could only be exchanged for two zhang of homespun cloth, which was not enough to make a quilt lining. Now, the same amount of millet can be exchanged for enough printed cloth and cotton to make a beautiful new quilt. Seeing the happy lives they are living today, the people of Yan'an and Northern Shaanxi have increased their confidence and courage in building a socialist society.
    Yan'an Has Been Rebuilt and Has New Development
    Yan'an City, which was destroyed by Hu Zongnan's bandit troops, has now been rebuilt and has new development. In the past, Yan'an Old City was bombed into rubble by Japanese planes, but now two main streets have been opened up in the city. On both sides of the road are newly built bungalows and buildings: there are small flour mills, oil presses, as well as cinemas, hospitals, and shops, as well as the Revolutionary Memorial Hall and the Forestry Exhibition Hall, which is being planned. In Dongguan, a newly built small thermal power plant supplies electricity to the whole city, and the Guaimao Match Factory, which was preserved during the war, continues to produce. New factories are under construction: there is an automobile repair shop outside the South Gate, and a tractor repair shop in Qiao'ergou. The "Culture Gully" area in the north of the city has become today's cultural area, and the number of middle and primary school students has increased by one and a half times compared with 1946. In addition, there are four newly built and under construction secondary specialized schools, such as agricultural schools and forestry schools. The urban area is being greened: on both sides of the Yan River, next to Pagoda Mountain, in Zaoyuan Gully, and on Yangjialing Mountain, local people and young people from all over the country have planted thousands of trees. This autumn, the green area will reach 33% of the total urban area. The Yangjialing Central Office Building and the Central Auditorium, the venue of the Party's Seventh National Congress, which were severely damaged by Hu Zongnan's bandit troops, have been restored according to their original style and color, and still maintain their magnificent and solemn appearance. Zaoyuan, Yangjialing, and Wangjiaping, where the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao lived, are now scenic spots for people to visit. All guests who go to Yan'an are attracted by these very simple but historically significant places.
        Much Work Still Needs to Be Done
    Of course, Yan'an and Northern Shaanxi are still relatively backward in terms of economy and culture; there are still many difficulties in people's lives; and there are still many shortcomings and errors in our work. Therefore, we still need to do a lot of work, especially to do a good job in mountain production planning, develop diversified economies, and develop cultural, educational, and health undertakings according to possible conditions, so as to fundamentally change the economic outlook of the mountain areas and further improve the people's material and cultural lives. We also need to do a good job in the urban construction plan of Yan'an to better preserve revolutionary historical relics and places of scenic interest. I believe that the Party members and people of Yan'an and Northern Shaanxi will resolutely support the resolutions of the Eighth National Congress of the Party and make greater efforts to thoroughly implement them, and will always follow the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and move from victory to victory.

    十一年间的大变化
    白志明同志的发言
    陕北人民的祝贺
    我带着延安和陕北的党员和人民对党的第八次代表大会的热诚期望和衷心祝贺，带着他们对党中央、毛主席的深切怀念和无比敬爱，来参加这次大会，觉得有说不出的兴奋和愉快。当召开党的第八次代表大会的消息传来以后，延安和陕北的党员和人民，回忆起从七大到八大的十一年中间所发生的巨大变化，心里充满无限的喜悦。正像杨家岭七一农业社社员蔡维元同志所说的：“七大在延安开会的时候，日本帝国主义还没有投降，国民党反动派还没有垮台。现在，咱们正在建设社会主义社会，延安今年也实现了农业合作化，又开始有了拖拉机，我们要搞好农业生产，支援工业建设，来庆祝八大的召开”。这些话充分地表达了延安和陕北的党员和人民的兴奋心情。
        从胜利到胜利
    七大以后，正当延安和陕北人民在党中央直接领导下，过着丰衣足食的幸福生活的时候，胡宗南匪军向党中央所在地——延安发动了进攻。延安和陕北人民高呼着“保卫党中央！”“保卫毛主席！”的口号，向敌人进行了英勇的斗争，从各方面积极配合人民解放军作战，终于取得了战争的胜利，光复了延安。在战争中，延安和陕北遭受胡宗南匪军的破坏是十分严重的。比如延安郊区有三十七个村庄变成了无人区，耕地荒芜了百分之四十以上，牲畜减少了百分之七十。延安光复以后，在毛主席住过的枣园村，有逃难回来的四十五户农民，只带回八头牛，二十只羊，他们在破破烂烂的窑洞里安家，几乎是赤手空拳地在荒芜了的土地上耕作。虽然，敌人的抢劫和破坏，使战后恢复工作遇到了许多困难，而去年大部分地区又受到自然灾害的袭击，但是，延安和陕北人民，并没有向任何困难低头。他们在党中央的亲切关怀、国务院调拨巨额粮款和全国各地的大力支援下，用自己的劳动和智慧克服了重重困难，医治好战争的创伤，战胜了灾荒，恢复和发展了生产。
    经过这几年来一系列的社会改革，特别是农业合作化的实现，为进一步发展生产开辟了广阔的道路。据延安市郊区三个农业社的调查，今年粮食亩产量比国民党军进攻之前的一九四六年增加了一倍以上。杨老庄农业社的山地小麦由过去的亩产五、六十斤增加到二百二十多斤，大面积丰产达到四百斤。而农业税比一九四六年减轻了一半。随着生产的恢复、发展和农业税的减轻，人民的生活得到逐步改善，社会购买力不断增长。特别是工业用品供应充足，价格合理，比如一九四八年以前，四斗小米只能换到二丈土布，不够做一块被里子，现在用同样多的小米换到的花布和棉花就可以做一床漂亮的新被子。延安和陕北人民看到自己今天所过的幸福日子，更增加了建设社会主义社会的信心和勇气。
    延安已经重建起来而且有了新发展
    被胡宗南匪军破坏了的延安市，现在已经重建起来，而且有了新的发展。延安旧城过去被日寇飞机炸成一片瓦砾，现在城内开辟了两条大街。马路两旁是新建的平房和楼房：这里有小型的面粉厂、榨油厂，也有影剧院、医院和商店，还有革命纪念馆和正在筹建的林业展览馆。在东关，新建的小型火力发电厂供给全市的用电，在战争中保存下来的拐峁火柴厂仍在继续生产。正在建设中的新工厂，南门外有汽车修配厂，桥儿沟有拖拉机修配厂。城北过去的“文化沟”一带，成为今天的文化区，中、小学学生比一九四六年增加了一倍半。此外，还有农业学校、林业学校等四所新建的和正在建设的中等专业学校。市区正在进行绿化：在延河两岸，在宝塔山旁，在枣园沟里，在杨家岭山上，当地群众和来自全国各地的青年，栽种了成千上万的树苗。今年秋季，绿化面积将达到市区总面积的百分之三十三。遭到胡宗南匪军严重破坏的杨家岭中央办公楼和党的第七次代表大会会场——中央大礼堂，已经按照原来的样式和色调修复起来了，仍然保持着宏伟、庄严的面貌。党中央、毛主席住过的枣园、杨家岭、王家坪，现在是人们游览参观的胜地，凡是到延安去的客人，都会被这些非常简朴的但是富有历史意义的地方所吸引。
        还需要作很多工作
    当然，延安和陕北在经济、文化方面还是比较落后的；人民生活中仍有不少的困难；而我们的工作也还有不少的缺点和错误。因此，我们还需要做很多的工作，特别是做好山区生产规划，发展多种经济，根据可能的条件发展文化、教育、卫生事业，以便从根本上改变山区的经济面貌，进一步地提高人民的物质生活和文化生活。我们还要做好延安的城市建设规划，把革命的历史文物和名胜古迹更好地保存下来。我相信：延安和陕北的党员和人民，一定坚决拥护党的第八次代表大会的决议，并为其彻底实现而付出更大的努力，一定永远跟着党中央和毛主席，从胜利走向胜利。
