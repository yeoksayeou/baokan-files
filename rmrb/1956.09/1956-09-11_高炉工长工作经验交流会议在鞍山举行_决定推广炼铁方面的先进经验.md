Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 10th. The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry and the Heavy Industry Trade Union held a blast furnace foreman work experience exchange conference in Anshan from September 3rd to September 8th. More than one hundred representatives from twelve units, including Anshan Iron and Steel, Wuhan Iron and Steel, Baotou Iron and Steel, and Shijingshan, Benxi, Chongqing, Longyan, Daye, and Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plants, attended the meeting, including factory directors, engineers, and blast furnace foremen.

At the meeting, Soviet expert Tsaryzin, consultant to the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry for Ironmaking, gave a report on "The Role of Foreman in Blast Furnace Production," and exchanged blast furnace operation experiences from iron and steel plants in various regions. After several days of discussion, it was decided that in the future, new technologies and advanced experiences such as high-temperature humid air operation, reducing sulfur content in pig iron, and low-manganese steelmaking pig iron would be vigorously promoted in ironmaking.

The meeting resolved the issue of unclear responsibilities of blast furnace foremen that had existed for several years. In the past, blast furnace foremen often had authority in name only but not in practice in leading the entire furnace's production. Some factories had very strict restrictions on the powers of blast furnace foremen. In view of this situation, the meeting formulated the "Basic Responsibility Regulations for Blast Furnace Shift Foremen," stipulating forty-four detailed rules of work.

During the meeting, the employees of the Anshan Iron and Steel's Communist Youth League-named Blast Furnace proposed an initiative to launch a socialist emulation campaign among blast furnaces nationwide from the fourth quarter onwards, in order to help each other and improve together; the foremen present unanimously expressed their support.

After the meeting, excellent engineers, technicians, and foremen formed a rotation group to observe and exchange experiences in iron and steel plants across the country.

    高炉工长工作经验交流会议在鞍山举行
    决定推广炼铁方面的先进经验
    新华社鞍山10日电　冶金工业部和重工业工会从9月3日到9月8日在鞍山召开了高炉工长工作经验交流会议。参加会议的有鞍钢、武钢、包钢和石景山、本溪、重庆、龙烟、大冶、太原钢铁厂等十二个单位的厂长、工程师、高炉工长等一百多个代表。
    会上，冶金工业部炼铁顾问苏联专家察里津作了“工长在高炉生产中的作用”的报告，并且交流了各地炼铁厂的高炉操作经验。经过几天讨论之后，决定今后在炼铁方面大力推广高温湿风操作、降低生铁含硫成份，以及低锰制钢生铁等新技术和先进经验。
    会上解决了几年来高炉工长职责不明的问题。过去高炉工长在领导全炉生产方面，往往有职无权，有些厂对高炉工长职权限制很严。根据这种情况，会上制定了“高炉值班工长基本职责条例”，规定了四十四条工作细则。
    会议期间，鞍钢共青团号高炉职工提出倡议，从第四季度起开展全国各高炉之间的社会主义竞赛，以便互相帮助，共同提高；到会各工长一致表示响应。
    会后，优秀的工程师、技师、工长等组成了轮回小组，准备到各地钢铁厂去观摩和交流经验。
