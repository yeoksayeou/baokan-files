Xinhua News Agency, September 29th: According to a United Press report, Indian Prime Minister Nehru, while visiting Jeddah in Saudi Arabia on September 27th, told reporters that the United Nations Security Council's debate on the Suez Canal issue could not solve the problem unless this debate led to direct negotiations between the two sides.

Nehru said: "The United Nations itself cannot resolve such a dispute. It can only produce a rigid statement of position, and cannot narrow the gap between the opinions of the conflicting parties. The two sides should hold direct talks at the same time as the Security Council debate, or afterwards."

Answering reporters' questions, he said that the Indian government "has repeatedly suggested that this issue should be resolved peacefully through direct negotiations between the two sides."

He said: "In our view, the distance between the two sides (regarding the Suez issue) is not very large. However, inflamed emotions have been aroused."

He said that the peace efforts of his roving ambassador, Menon—currently in London—"have encountered difficulties."

He added: "But if you transform an atmosphere of hopelessness into an atmosphere of hope, you have already achieved something significant."

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, September 28th: According to the Indian Press Trust, Saudi Arabian King Saud said on September 27th that it appears world opinion favors solving the Suez Canal issue through negotiations within the United Nations.

Answering questions from an Indian Press Trust reporter in Riyadh, he said: "We hope that the solution to the Suez issue will allow all ships to pass freely through the canal at any time. The many detailed issues that exist now can be resolved through negotiations with Egypt, which possesses sovereignty over the canal."

Xinhua News Agency, September 29th: TASS, Tehran, September 28th: Iranian Court Minister Eqbal, in a telegram on behalf of the Iranian King to Abdel Rahman Tagi, Rector of Al-Azhar University in Egypt, stated that "Iran firmly opposes the use of force and will make every effort to safeguard Egypt's sovereignty and independence, as long as Egypt is willing to safeguard the freedom of navigation for all ships on this important international waterway."

This telegram was a response to a telegram recently sent by Abdel Rahman Tagi to the heads of various countries, in which Tagi called on them to support Egypt on the Suez Canal issue.

    尼赫鲁总理和沙特国王分别发表谈话

    伊朗表示要维护埃及主权反对使用武力
    据新华社29日讯　据合众社报道，印度总理尼赫鲁9月27日在访问沙特阿拉伯的吉达时曾经对记者说，联合国安全理事会就苏伊士运河问题进行辩论并不能解决问题，除非这种辩论能够导致双方举行直接的谈判。
    尼赫鲁说：“联合国本身不能解决这样一种争执。它只能产生一个表示立场的硬性的声明，而不能使冲突的双方意见距离缩小。双方应该在安全理事会辩论的同时，或在以后举行直接的会谈。”
    他在回答记者的问题时说，印度政府“曾经再三建议这个问题应该通过双方的直接谈判来求得和平解决”。
    他说：“在我们看来，双方（关于苏伊士问题的意见）的距离不是非常大的。不过已经激起愤激的情绪。”
    他说，他的巡回大使梅农——目前在伦敦——的和平努力“已经遇到困难”。
    他又说：“但是，如果你把没有希望的气氛变成了有希望的气氛，你已经获得一些重大的成就。”
    据新华社新德里28日电　据印度报业托辣斯报道，沙特阿拉伯国王沙特9月27日说，看来世界舆论都赞成苏伊士运河问题在联合国中通过谈判来解决。
    他在利雅得答复印度报业托辣斯记者的问题时说：“我们希望苏伊士问题的解决能够使一切船只在任何时候完全自由地通过运河。现在存在着的许多细节问题都可以同拥有对运河的主权的埃及进行谈判而解决。”
    新华社29日讯　据塔斯社德黑兰28日讯：伊朗宫廷大臣埃格巴尔在代表伊朗国王给埃及爱资哈尔大学校长阿卜杜勒·腊赫曼·塔季的电报中表示，“伊朗坚决反对使用武力，同时尽一切努力来维护埃及的主权和独立，只要埃及愿意维护一切船只在这条很重要的国际水道上的通航自由。”
    这封电报是对最近阿卜杜勒·腊赫曼·塔季分别打给各国首脑的电报的答复。塔季在电报中呼吁他们在苏伊士运河问题上支持埃及。
