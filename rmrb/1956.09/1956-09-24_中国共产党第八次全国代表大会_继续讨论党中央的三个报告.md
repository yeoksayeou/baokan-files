Xinhua News Agency, September 23rd—The Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China continued its sessions this afternoon, discussing the three reports made by the Party Central Committee. The delegates who spoke during the discussion unanimously expressed their agreement with the three reports.

    Lai Ruoyu (Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions) spoke first today. He focused on the issue of further leveraging the role of trade union organizations in socialist construction.

    Li Lisan (Deputy Minister of the Industrial and Transportation Work Department of the CPC Central Committee) spoke from the lessons of his past mistakes, illustrating the serious harm of subjectivism and sectarianism to the cause of the Party. Li Lisan also spoke from his own experience, particularly about the correctness and greatness of the Party's policy in dealing with errors within the Party.

    Tan Zheng (Deputy Director of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army) explained some issues of political work in the new stage of the PLA's development in his speech.

    The delegates present warmly welcomed the speeches of representatives from brother parties around the world who are engaged in heroic struggles. When they stepped onto the podium one after another and finished their speeches, all the delegates stood up, and the storm of applause lasted for a long time.

    Comrade Yata, head of the delegation of the Moroccan Communist Party from Morocco, which has already shaken off the shackles of colonialism, said in his speech to the Congress today that we are sounding the alarm here and appealing loudly to progressive humanity around the world, requesting strong assistance to the Algerian people who are in distress. The representatives of brother parties from various countries present and all the delegates responded to his remarks with warm applause.

    Comrade Yata went on to point out that the French imperialists are also trying to drag other countries into the war over the Suez Canal, thinking that this would free themselves from the Algerian predicament. He said, we solemnly declare that if Egypt unfortunately becomes the object of aggression, all Moroccans will consider themselves to be at war with French imperialism and its supporters. The audience once again responded with warm applause.

    Comrade Wickremasinghe, head of the delegation of the Communist Party of Ceylon, said in his speech that the Communist Party of Ceylon is proud that it played a leading role in the mass movement that forced the former government of Ceylon to sign the China-Ceylon Trade Agreement despite significant pressure from the United States. When he said that the Communist Party of Ceylon is now working to mobilize the people of Ceylon to isolate and defeat the imperialist and domestic reactionary forces that are trying to make the current government follow the old path of the former reactionary government, the audience applauded warmly.

    Comrade Wickremasinghe presented a gift to the Congress on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ceylon.

    The representative of the Cuban People's Socialist Party, which is being subjected to barbaric persecution by US imperialism and its appendages, addressed the Congress. The delegates warmly applauded the congratulatory message from the National Committee of the Cuban People's Socialist Party read by him, which expressed the firm will of the Cuban people against imperialism and feudalism.

    Comrade Shrestha, a representative of the Communist Party of Nepal, delivered a speech and read out the congratulatory message from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Nepal to the Congress. When the congratulatory message mentioned that the traditional friendship between Nepal and China has been re-established, and the Prime Minister of Nepal will soon visit China, which will be of great significance to the friendly cooperation between Nepal and China, the audience responded with warm applause.

    After his speech, Comrade Shrestha presented a gift to the Congress on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Nepal.

    Comrade Stringos, head of the delegation of the Communist Party of Greece, said in his speech that getting rid of the shackles of imperialism, especially US imperialism, has become the slogan of the entire Greek nation. He pointed out that the heroic struggle of the Cypriot people for self-determination has become a national issue for Greece. This struggle has further weakened the influence of US imperialism in Greece.

    When Comrade Stringos said that the Greek people have grown up and been tempered in the battle for national independence, the audience burst into warm applause.

    Comrade Fuenberg, head of the delegation of the Communist Party of Austria, said in his speech that it took our country ten years to gain autonomy and declare permanent neutrality. Austrian communists defend Austria's neutrality, which strikes a blow at the imperialist policy of war. His words aroused warm applause from the audience.

    Comrade Wok, head of the delegation of the Swiss Labor Party, expressed fraternal friendship to the Communist Party of China in his speech. When he said that the main task of the Swiss Labor Party at present is to defend the interests of the working people, safeguard national independence, and ensure the neutrality of the country, he was warmly applauded.

    The delegates warmly applauded the speech of the representative of the Costa Rican People's Vanguard Party, who is fighting in the heartland of US imperialist rule. He read out the congratulatory message from the Central Committee of the Costa Rican People's Vanguard Party and presented a gift to the Congress.

    Comrade Skilton, representative of the Communist Party of New Zealand, conveyed the congratulations of the white and Maori communists of New Zealand in his speech, and read out the congratulatory message from the National Committee of the Communist Party of New Zealand, signed by General Secretary Wilcox. The delegates welcomed and thanked them for their congratulations with warm applause.

    Comrade Wilner, head of the delegation of the Communist Party of Israel, said in his speech that the imperialists are instigating Israel to take adventurous actions against Egypt in order to regain control of the Suez Canal. He said that any military adventure by Israel against Egypt would be tantamount to suicide. As patriots and internationalists, Israeli communists will do their best to establish an anti-imperialist peace front in Israel to prevent this dangerous development.

    Comrade Wilner said: "The national interests of the Israeli people and the Arab peoples are consistent: they are all against imperialism, demand independence, and demand peace. We fully support the Egyptian government's just and legitimate action to nationalize the Suez Canal. This action weakens imperialism, thus benefiting the cause of peace and the cause of independence for the peoples of the Middle East, including the people of Israel." His remarks were welcomed by the delegates with a long period of applause.

    Executive Chairman Zhou Yang successively read out the congratulatory letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Turkey, the congratulatory telegram from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Portugal, and the congratulatory letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Tunisia at today's meeting. These congratulatory letters and telegrams conveyed the sincere respect of the three countries' communist parties for the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people, and also showed their infinite determination in the struggles they are waging. All the delegates thanked the brother parties for their precious friendship with warm applause.

    Liu Chuanyou (Secretary of the Shouzhang County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China in Shandong Province) also spoke today.

    The executive chairmen of today's conference were: Chen Yi, Chen Yu, Deng Yingchao, Deng Zihui, Ke Qingshi, Ma Mingfang, Zhang Dingcheng, Zhou Yang, and Xu Xiangqian.

    Today's conference ended at 5:55 pm. The meeting will continue tomorrow.
