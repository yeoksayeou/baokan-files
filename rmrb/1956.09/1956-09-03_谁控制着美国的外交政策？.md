Who exactly is it?

It is the same group of people who control American domestic policy.

So, who are they?

"The masters of the American government are the combined capitalists and manufacturers of America."

Who said this? It was U.S. President Wilson, in a rare moment of candor.

To be clearer, American policy is controlled by nearly eighty influential families – the Rockefellers, Morgans, DuPonts, and others – who occupy the mythically wealthy kingdoms of steel, automobiles, chemicals, rubber, aluminum, public utilities, railroads, banks, and other vast enterprises.

How do they control America?

Through the power of the "almighty dollar" and countless improper means.

Manufacturing Public Opinion

The main keystone that shakily supports the arch of dollar democracy is the American public opinion, massively manufactured by Wall Street.

The American humorist Will Rogers often began his biting commentary on current affairs with the line: "All I know is what I read in the papers…". For millions of Americans, this is all too true. They are carefully trained not to notice the realities of life beyond the newspapers and other media.

In America, the industry of manufacturing public opinion has developed into a giant of giants. Today, American capitalists have created a machine for manufacturing pervasive public opinion, which has become a huge factor in maintaining the capitalist grip on power, preventing the working class from seeing their own interests, and driving the country to the brink of war.

Many of the unreasonable actions of the United States in recent years, which have damaged its reputation in the eyes of the world, can be explained by this. However, considering the depth of American poisoning, the important thing is not how many people are deceived, but how many are watching the American democratic tradition with unblinking eyes.

The Voice of Their Masters

Having completely controlled almost all newspapers, radio stations, movies, television, schools, and podiums, Wall Street no longer finds it difficult to control American political parties. After being able to deceive and mislead the people, pouring a large amount of distorted information into their minds, it is easier to drive them to vote in a certain way.

"Voice of America" is making a big noise about the internal democracy of parties in the socialist world, but it says nothing about the truly appalling state of internal democracy in the two bourgeois parties that dominate American domestic politics.

A few people holding secret meetings in offices with ventilation equipment at the top of skyscrapers to select candidates, the "bosses" and gangsterism controlling the political machines of large cities, poll taxes and other obstacles preventing 7.7 million blacks and whites in the southern states from participating in the last national election, virtually no party activity other than campaigning and post-election distribution of official positions – once you take note of all this, it is very difficult to imagine a situation with even lower levels of democracy inside the American bourgeois parties than exists today.

People often say: "He who pays the piper calls the tune." Cautious Wall Street never puts all its eggs in one basket. It funds both parties. Therefore, whether the Republican or Democratic Party wins or loses, Wall Street is unaffected. Thus, it is not surprising that the Democratic and Republican parties, especially on decisive foreign policy issues, sing a duet of the same Wall Street tune.

In this situation, the U.S. government obtains its "mandate from the people" through national elections held every four years. Then, America's rulers can do as they please for four years, without having to worry about being toppled by a vote of no confidence from the parliament like the governments of England and France, who can be brought down at any time.

The President, as the head of state, has always been regarded as the arbiter of foreign policy and must fulfill his party's platform on foreign policy. However, since the public has been taught to forget party platforms as quickly as politicians do, campaign promises rarely become an obstacle for a president who is prepared to implement even more reactionary policies.

The President usually appoints a Secretary of State to head foreign policy, and this Secretary of State's policies have always been considered to be in line with his party's platform. In reality, the President and his Secretary of State often disregard the rules when formulating policies and platforms, a situation that is consciously encouraged by the parties' habit of expressing their foreign policy orientations in general terms.

Wall Street – The Axis of Washington

In the past four years, the world public has known that the United States has appointed a Wall Street lawyer as its Secretary of State. In fact, every department in the United States is headed by a Wall Street tycoon: in American history, Washington has never been so obviously an office of Wall Street as it is now.

Of course, dollar democracy still maintains the appearance that the people's voice is still heard in foreign policy decisions. In addition to being considered to occasionally take foreign policy issues into account when voting for executive and legislative officials, the people are also assumed to be able to express their opinions through the foreign affairs committees of the Senate and House of Representatives.

These committees do have great power, but they rarely stand on the side of the people. Not only are they in a position to advise the President, but they can also promote or kill foreign policy legislation. The chairmen of these committees are out-and-out dictators.

How does one become chairman? It depends on seniority – the number of years served in the Senate and House of Representatives – an ambiguous condition. In the first half of this century, seniority was usually monopolized by the southern feudal racist oligarchy. This oligarchy, by restricting voting rights to a small, easily manipulated minority, was able to send the same demagogues to Washington year after year.

Given that a group of thugs openly advocating "white supremacy" control congressional foreign policy, it is not surprising that the selection of the Asian people and Asian regions as targets for dropping atomic bombs and conducting atomic bomb tests, and the concept of encouraging Asians to attack Asians, have become national policies. And most notably, Wall Street imperialism and Southern feudalism always have a tacit understanding in these matters.

The Democracy of Mail

Whenever a foreign policy debate unfolds, Congress and the White House receive a large number of letters and telegrams. Sometimes, this is a genuine reflection of public sentiment, but more often it is the result of a major propaganda campaign launched by Wall Street. That is to say, the "will of the people" is first manufactured by the shadow government, and then it pretends to listen to this opinion.

Washington has always been accustomed to evaluating the mail it receives by weight rather than value: the assigned secretary separates the letters of support from those of opposition, and if the weight of the mail opposing a bill exceeds that of the mail supporting it, it indicates that the representative or party supporting the bill is at risk of losing the next election, especially as the election approaches. In this case, these bills are always disguised with amendments.

To avoid some of the inevitable awkwardness in this regard, Wall Street has long tried to equate disagreement with foreign policy with treason. For example, the State Department promised to issue Paul Robeson a passport on the condition that he promise to only sing and not speak abroad. Because Robeson said in rebuttal to the House "Un-American Activities Committee": "You are not patriots, you are not Americans, you should be ashamed of yourselves!" he is now facing the danger of imprisonment.

    谁控制着美国的外交政策？
    美国  肯尼迪
    究竟是谁呢？
    对的，正是控制美国国内政策的那一批人。
    那么他们是些什么人呢？
    “美国政府的主人就是那些联合起来的美国资本家和制造商”。
    这话是谁说的？这是美国的威尔逊总统，在不大经常看到的坦白的瞬间说出来的。
    更清楚地说，美国的政策是由近八十个有势力的家族——洛克菲勒、摩根、杜邦和其他一些人所控制，他们占据着神话般富足的钢铁、汽车、化学、橡胶、铝、公共事业、铁路、银行以及其他规模宏大的王国。
    他们怎样控制美国呢？
    是通过“万能的美元”的力量以及各种不可胜数的不正当手段。
      制造舆论的工业
    摇摇欲坠地支持着美元民主的拱门的主要基调，就是那为华尔街所大量制造的美国舆论。
    美国的幽默作家威尔·罗格斯在他辛辣地评述时事时经常总是用这样一句话作导言：“我所知道的一切全是来自报纸……”。对于千百万美国人来说，这确是最真实不过的。他们被小心翼翼地训练着不要透过报纸和其他舆论媒介物去注意生活的现实。
    在美国，制造舆论的工业已发展成为巨人中的巨人。今天美国的资本家已经制造了这样一个制造无孔不入的舆论的机器，这个机器竟成了维持资本主义掌握政权、使工人阶级看不清自己的利益、把国家驱向战争边缘的巨大因素。
    近年来美国的那些使它在世界公众面前声名狼籍的很多不合理行为，正可以在这里找到说明。但是由于考虑到美国人的中毒之深，因此重要的不在于有多少人受到迷惑，而是在于有多少人在目不转睛地注视着美国的民主传统。
      他们的老板的声音
    华尔街在完全控制了几乎所有的报刊、广播电台、电影、电视、学校和讲台以后，它在控制美国的政党方面已不会再感到困难了。在能够蒙蔽和欺骗人民，把大量歪曲了的东西灌注到他们的思想中去以后，要驱使他们去怎样投票，就比较容易了。
      “美国之音”正在大事喧嚷社会主义世界的政党的党内民主情况，但它对统治美国内政的两个资产阶级政党的党内民主的真正恶劣的情况却只字不提。
    在摩天大楼顶部有通风设备的办公室里，是少数人在举行秘密会议来选定一些候选人、控制大城市的政治机器的是“头领”和匪徒行为，投票税和其他障碍阻止了七百七十万黑人和白人在南部各州参加上次全国选举，除了竞选和选后分派官职以外实际上并无所谓任何政党活动，只要注意到这一切，那么要设想比今天美国资产阶级政党内部民主更为低落的情况，是非常困难的。
    人们常说：“谁付钱，谁点戏。”稳扎稳打的华尔街从不把它的力量只用在一个方面。它对两个政党都给予资助。所以不论是共和党或民主党胜利或失败，都无损于华尔街。因此，民主党、共和党，特别是在决定性外交政策问题上都是唱着同一的华尔街调子的二重奏就不足为奇了。
    在这种情况下，美国政府就通过每隔四年举行一次的全国选举来取得它的“人民的委托”。接着美国的执政者们就可以不受约束地搞他四年，而不必像那随时可以因国会的不信任票而倒台的英、法政府那样。
    总统，作为国家的元首，一向被认作是外交政策的裁决者，而且必须履行他的党在外交政策上的政纲。不过，既然公众已被教导着像政客们一样尽速忘记政党的政纲，因此竞选的诺言就很少会成为一个准备实行更反动政策的总统的障碍。
    总统通常总是任命一位国务卿来主持外交政策，这位国务卿的政策也一向被认作是必须符合于他的党的政纲。实际上，总统和他的国务卿在制定政策和政纲时，都经常不遵守规则，这种情况更由于各党惯于用一般辞句提出它们的外交政策方针而受到有意识的鼓励。
    华尔街——华盛顿的轴心
    在过去四年中，世界公众都知道，美国任命了一位华尔街的律师作它的国务卿。其实，美国的每个部都是在一位华尔街大亨的主持下：在美国历史上，华盛顿还从没有像现在这样明显地成为华尔街的一个办事处。
    当然，美元民主仍然在维持着这样的外表，仿佛在外交政策的决定上，人民的声音仍被听取似的。人民除了被认作有时在投票选举行政和立法官员时也能考虑到外交政策问题以外，还被假定为能够通过参众两院的外交委员会来表达他们的意见。
    这些委员会的确拥有很大的权力，但它们却很少站在人民方面。它们不仅具有向总统提建议的地位，而且能促成或扼杀一项外交政策的立法。这些委员会的主席是不折不扣的独裁者。
    一个人怎样才能做到主席呢？这要取决于资历——在参院和众院服务的年限——这样一个暧昧的条件。在本世纪上半期，资历通常总是为南部封建种族主义的寡头政治所垄断。这个寡头政治以限制投票权的办法，使选民只限于一小群可以操纵的少数，这样就能年复一年地向华盛顿派遣那同一批煽动家。
    既然有这样一批公然主张“白人至上”的打手控制着国会的外交政策，那么把亚洲人民和亚洲地区选作爆炸原子弹和进行原子弹试验的对象，以及把怂恿亚洲人攻打亚洲人这样一个概念作为国家的政策也就不足为奇了。而最值得注意的是，在这些事情上，华尔街的帝国主义和南方封建主义总是有着默契的。
          邮件的民主
    每当外交政策的辩论展开以后，国会和白宫总会收到大批信件和电报。有时，这确是公众情绪的真正反映，但更经常地是由于华尔街所发动的大事宣传的结果。这就是说，先由太上政府制造出“人民的愿望”，然后再装作听取这个意见的样子。
    华盛顿一向习惯于按重量而不是按价值来评价寄来的邮件：指定的秘书把赞成和反对的信件分开来，如果反对某项议案的邮件的重量超过了赞成的邮件，这就表示支持这项议案的代表或党在下次有落选的危险，特别是在选举临近的时候。在这种情况下，这些议案总是用修正条文伪装起来。
    为了避免在这方面的一些必然有的尴尬局面，很久以来华尔街就尽力把在外交政策上的不同意见和叛国这两件事等同起来。例如，国务院答应发给保尔·罗伯逊护照的条件是，他必须允诺在国外只唱歌而不发表谈话。由于罗伯逊在驳斥众院“非美活动调查委员会”中说了这样的话：“你们不是爱国主义者，你们不是美国人，你们应该感到自惭！”他现在正面临着受监禁的危险。
