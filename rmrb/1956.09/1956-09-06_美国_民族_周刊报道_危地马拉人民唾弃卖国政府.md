Xinhua News Agency, 4th: The U.S. "The Nation" weekly recently published a dispatch by David Graham, reporting on the situation in Guatemala.

The dispatch pointed out that it has been two years since Carlos Castillo Armas illegally seized power in Guatemala. During this time, his collusion with those who put him in power (foreign capital and domestic feudalism) has only increased and become more concrete.

After Armas formed the government, he quickly recognized the Trujillo (Dominican dictator) and Franco regimes, dissolved the Congress, reduced the electorate, levied a "liberation tax," and passed a law to deal with "dangerous ideas." He then proceeded to return all the land expropriated from the United Fruit Company and abolished all taxes on profits and dividends for investors residing abroad.

Less than six months after taking office, Armas began to relax the country's petroleum law by administrative decree. The new petroleum law, promulgated on July 8, 1955, stipulates that oil can now be exploited by anyone and crude oil can be transported out (while gasoline is resold to Guatemala).

Recently, there have been three public and vehement attacks on the Armas regime: the May Day demonstration, the students' pranks at Easter, and the June 25 demonstration, in which at least three students were shot dead by the police.

The students' attack at Easter was very fierce. Demonstrators shouted slogans against the government outside the windows of the National Palace, drove the official speakers off the stage, took control of the meeting, and shouted through the acquired loudspeakers, "Firmly oppose this 'liberation' and the current regime."

Now foreign diplomats believe that anything can happen in Guatemala. The key is U.S. support. If the Guatemalan people were allowed to choose for themselves, they probably would not tolerate their dictator for long.

### 美国“民族”周刊报道  危地马拉人民唾弃卖国政府

    美国“民族”周刊报道
    危地马拉人民唾弃卖国政府
    据新华社4日讯　不久以前美国“民族”周刊刊载了戴维·格雷姆的一篇通讯，报道危地马拉的情况。
    这篇通讯指出，自从卡洛斯·卡斯蒂略·阿马斯非法劫夺了危地马拉的政权以来已经有两年了，在这个时间内，他同那些使他当权的人们（外国资本和国内封建主义）勾结一气的种种表现只有与时俱增而且越来越具体。
    阿马斯成立了政府以后，迅速承认了特鲁希略（多米尼加的独裁者）和佛朗哥政权，解散了国会，减少了选民，征收了“解放税”和通过了一项对付“危险思想”的法律，以后接着就发还了从联合果品公司那里征用的所有土地并且取消了对居住在国外的投资人的所有利润和红利的征税。
    阿马斯当政还不到六个月，他就开始用行政命令的办法放宽这个国家的石油法。在1955年7月8日公布的新石油法里规定，石油现在可以由任何人开采并且将原油运出去（而把汽油再售给危地马拉）。
    最近已经发生了三起公开和激烈攻击阿马斯政权的事情：五一节示威、大学生在复活节时的恶作剧以及6月25日的示威，在这次示威中至少有三名学生被警察开枪打死。
    学生们在复活节时所发动的攻击很凶猛，示威者在国家大厦窗外高呼反对政府的口号，把官方演说的人撵下了台而掌握了集会并且通过获得的扩音器高喊“坚决反对这种‘解放’和现政权。”
    现在外国外交家们认为，在危地马拉什么事情都可以发生。问题的关键是美国的支持。如果让危地马拉人民自行选择的话，他们大概是不会长久容忍他们的独裁者的。
