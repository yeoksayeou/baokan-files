    Turning Resistance into Assistance: Successfully Remolding Bourgeois Elements
    --How Tianjin Municipality Works with Capitalist Family Members--
    Speech by Comrade Xu Ming
    Now I would like to offer some opinions on Tianjin's work with capitalist family members.
    While carrying out the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, we conducted a series of work targeting capitalist family members. Facts have proven that this work plays a significant role in promoting the acceptance of socialist transformation by bourgeois elements.
    Recognizing the Positive and Negative Aspects of Capitalist Family Members
    The ideological state of capitalist family members is extremely complex. They share the same life and interests as the capitalists. They hope that their husbands can earn more money and fear losing their property. Their thoughts are often reflections of the capitalists' thoughts. However, as women, they had no status in society and family in the past. Although their material lives were superior, they felt spiritually empty and distressed. They expect their husbands to earn more money, but they also fear that their husbands will take multiple wives and abandon them after getting rich. After liberation, their marital problems were guaranteed, and their family status also changed. Moreover, after they participated in social activities, their role was valued, and they enjoyed equal rights between men and women. From their own experiences, they truly felt the benefits of the new society. As long as we patiently persuade and educate them, and specifically explain the significance of the policy of peaceful transformation of the bourgeoisie, they have the possibility of accepting transformation. This is their positive side. On the other hand, because they have lived an exploitative and parasitic life for a long time, they have developed a bourgeois consciousness of loving ease and hating work. Economically, they are subordinate and rely on their husbands for a living. Therefore, they worry that their husbands' status and income will decline, affecting their own lives. At the same time, most of them participate less in social activities and have fewer opportunities to receive policy education from the Party and the state, so they have more concerns about socialist transformation. Therefore, they become an obstacle to our transformation of bourgeois elements. State cadres may say a thousand words to capitalists to explain the benefits of peaceful transformation, but they cannot match one night's talk with the capitalist's wife. This is their negative side. Our task is to give full play to their positive side and eliminate their negative side, and patiently work with capitalist family members, turning resistance into assistance, to achieve the goal of smoothly transforming bourgeois elements.
    Basic Knowledge Education on Women's Liberation Was Conducted in the Early Days of Liberation
    Work with capitalist family members began shortly after liberation. At that time, they had many concerns. They feared confiscation, struggle, and even being forbidden to perm their hair and wear fancy clothes. In order to stabilize and win them over, we mobilized and contacted them individually through the relationships of progressive elements among them, and adopted methods suitable for them. For example, we organized family women's associations and adopted methods such as heart-to-heart talks, forums, and tea parties to guide them to gradually participate in social activities; we educated them on issues that were easy for them to understand and accept, and organized general political studies; we mobilized them to participate in social reforms and political movements; and we politically arranged representatives among them. Focusing on their own pain, we conducted basic knowledge education on women's liberation. The promulgation of the Marriage Law played a great encouraging role for them. Their political consciousness was initially raised, they participated in political activities more actively, they had learning requirements, their family status was improved, and they felt that the new society also provided them with guarantees.
    During the "Five-Anti" Movement, Educate Them to Encourage Relatives to Love the Country, Abide by the Law, and Obey the Leadership of the Working Class
    The "Five-Anti" movement shook the bourgeoisie, and many capitalist family members were also uneasy. Under such circumstances, we concentrated on explaining to them the Party's policies of utilizing, restricting, and transforming the bourgeoisie, so that they clearly understood their responsibility: to encourage their relatives to love the country, abide by the law, and obey the leadership of the working class. Through this kind of education, their worries were dispelled. Some people actively promoted their husbands to confess their problems frankly, and some family members were unwilling to let their children wear the hats of capitalists again, and removed their children's names from the stocks. Generally, people also criticized the past thoughts of only caring about enjoyment, and generally expressed their willingness to seriously participate in political studies and to do something for the people.
    After the "Five-Anti" movement, some people voluntarily came out to run childcare facilities or participate in other social activities.
    Socialist Prospect Education Was Conducted After the General Line Was Announced
    In 1953, the Party announced the general line for the transition period, and capitalists and their family members became greatly uneasy again. Some people, considering that the means of production must be owned by the whole people, took the opportunity to seize "means of subsistence," buying houses, furniture, watches, etc. In light of this situation, we systematically conducted socialist prospect education on capitalist family members, specifically explaining the content of the general line, so that they recognized that taking the socialist road was the general trend and the desire of the people. After transformation, capitalists could become self-reliant laborers, still have jobs, and have food to eat. Those with technical or management abilities can also become state civil servants. At this time, they felt "a weight lifted off their shoulders," and their political consciousness was significantly improved, which prepared the way for further exerting their role in the upsurge of socialist transformation.
    During the Upsurge of Whole Industry Public-Private Partnership, the Policy of Socialist Transformation Was Repeatedly Explained to Them
    During the upsurge of the whole industry public-private partnership of private industrial and commercial enterprises, some capitalist family members still had concerns. They were generally concerned about their husbands' work arrangements and their family's livelihood. In response to this situation, we extensively launched work with capitalist family members, explaining to them the relationship between the socialist future and women's liberation, and repeatedly explaining the policies in light of their own interests. They generally believed that they had taken "a reassuring pill" and expressed their willingness to actively accept transformation. Some family members even helped to clear up assets and estimate prices, and encouraged their relatives to do a good job in public-private relations, be responsible and conscientious, and obey the leadership. During this period, the capitalist family members organized a 1,500-person work team to carry out propaganda activities, visiting families with concerns and conducting specific persuasion and explanation work. After the practical education of the upsurge of socialist transformation, the original activists became more active, the intermediate elements turned to the active side, and the backward elements were greatly reduced. Many people were afraid of being associated with us in the past, but now they are afraid of not being associated with us, and actively approached us. Some participated in street work, some became literacy teachers, and some came out to run nurseries and day care centers. As far as is known, they have run 18 nurseries, taking care of more than 800 children, and there are three more to be opened. Some family members with culture and technology have the desire to participate in work, and some have already taken up work positions. At present, in order to further improve the work with capitalist family members, more than 7,800 people have been organized to participate in theoretical and political studies. The attendance rate of various study classes and groups is generally above 90%, rain or shine, and the learning atmosphere is very good.
    The above is the process of our work with capitalist family members. It can be seen that under the rapidly changing social conditions in our country, through our continuous work, major changes have taken place among bourgeois women. And this group of people, due to class restrictions and the narrow and closed scope of life, their understanding and awareness are very low.
    If women's liberation is a sign of social liberation, then the changes of bourgeois women accurately represent the changes that have taken place in the Chinese national bourgeoisie under the correct policies of our Party.
    Cultivate and Expand the Ranks of Activists Among Capitalist Family Members
    In the work with capitalist family members, cultivating activists and cultivating backbones is very important. We should constantly expand the ranks of activists, so that they can play a leading role, a bridge role and a backbone role, and lead the middle and backward elements to accept transformation together. Because the cadres who work with capitalist family members are a minority after all, and at the same time, they must take care of their different characteristics and requirements from other women, it is necessary to discover and cultivate activists from among them to carry out the work of family members. This is necessary and effective.
    Although we have done some work with capitalist family members, it is still far from enough. In order to further unite and transform them, the Party must strengthen its leadership, educate Party members and cadres, especially women cadres, to deeply understand the importance of this work, overcome the fear of losing their position or the idea of ​​being troublesome, seriously study the Party's policies, continue to study the characteristics of capitalist family members, and promptly grasp their ideological situation, and unremittingly educate them. Transform work so that they can play a more beneficial role in the cause of socialist transformation and construction.

    变阻力为助力，顺利地改造资产阶级分子
    ——天津市是怎样对资本家家属进行工作的——
    许明同志的发言
    现在我就天津市对资本家家属的工作，发表一些意见。
    我们在对资本主义工商业进行社会主义改造的同时，对资本家的家属进行了一系列的工作。事实证明，这些工作对于推动资产阶级分子接受社会主义改造，有着重大的作用。
    认识资本家家属积极的一面和消极的一面
    资本家家属的思想情况是极为复杂的。她们和资本家生活相同，利害与共。她们希望自己的丈夫能多多赚钱，唯恐失去了财产。她们的思想常常是资本家的思想反映。但是，作为妇女来说，过去她们在社会上和家庭中没有地位，她们的物质生活虽然优越，在精神上却十分空虚、苦闷。她们期望自己的丈夫能够赚更多的钱，但又害怕丈夫在发了财后，娶三妻四妾，遗弃自己。解放以后，她们在婚姻问题上得到了保障，家庭地位也有所改变，而且在她们参加社会活动后，她们的作用受到重视，享受到男女平等的权利。她们从亲身经历中，真正感到新社会对她们的好处。只要我们耐心地进行说服教育，具体阐明对资产阶级进行和平改造政策的意义，她们就有接受改造的可能，这是她们积极的一面。另一方面，由于她们长期过着剥削寄生生活，养成了好逸恶劳的资产阶级意识，在经济上处于从属地位，依靠丈夫生活，所以顾虑丈夫的地位和收入下降，影响到自己的生活。同时，她们多数人参加社会活动较少，受到党和国家的政策教育的机会比较少，对于社会主义改造的顾虑也就比较多。因此，而成为我们对资产阶级分子进行改造的一种阻力。国家干部为了说明和平改造的好处，对资本家讲了千言万语，却抵不住资本家老婆的一夕话。这是她们消极的一面。我们的任务就是要充分发挥其积极的一面，消除其消极的一面。耐心地进行资本家家属的工作，变阻力为助力，以达到顺利地改造资产阶级分子的目的。
    解放初期进行了关于妇女解放的基本知识的教育
    对于资本家家属的工作，是在解放后不久开始进行的。那时，她们的顾虑重重，她们怕没收，怕斗争，甚至怕不让烫发和穿花衣服。为了安定、争取她们，我们通过她们当中的进步分子的关系，个别动员、联系，采取适宜于她们的方式。如组织家庭妇女联谊会，并采取谈心、座谈、茶会等，引导她们逐渐参加社会活动；从她们易于了解和接受的问题进行教育，组织一般的政治学习；发动她们参加社会改革和政治运动；并在政治上安排了她们中的代表人物。针对她们切身的痛苦，进行了有关妇女解放的基本知识的教育。婚姻法的公布，更对他们起了很大的鼓舞作用。她们的政治觉悟初步提高了，参加政治活动比较积极了，有了学习的要求，家庭地位有所提高，感到新社会对她们也有保障。
    “五反”运动中教育她们鼓励亲属爱国守法，服从工人阶级领导
    “五反”运动震动了资产阶级，许多资本家的家属也惶惶不安。在这种情况下，我们集中地向她们交代了党对资产阶级利用、限制和改造的政策，使她们明确自己的责任是：鼓励亲属爱国守法、服从工人阶级的领导。通过这样的教育，她们的忧虑打消了，有些人积极推动她们的丈夫坦白交代了问题，也有些家属不愿自己的子女再戴上资本家的帽子，将子女的名字从股票上去掉。一般人也批判了过去只顾享受的思想，普遍表示要认真参加政治学习，并愿为人民作些事情。
    “五反”运动以后，有的自动出来办托儿事业，或参加其他社会活动。
    总路线公布以后进行了社会主义的前途教育
    一九五三年，党公布了在过渡时期的总路线，资本家及其家属又大为不安。有些人考虑到生产资料一定要实行全民所有，就趁机抓“生活资料”，买房子、买家具、买手表等。根据这种情况，我们对资本家家属正面地有系统地进行了社会主义的前途教育，具体地解释了总路线的内容，使她们认识走社会主义道路是大势所趋，人心所向，经过改造，资本家可以变为自食其力的劳动者，仍然会有工作，有饭吃。有技术或管理能力的，还可以成为国家公职人员。这时，她们才“一块石头落了地”，政治觉悟有了明显的提高，这就为在社会主义改造高潮中进一步发挥她们的作用准备了条件。
    全行业合营高潮中向她们反复交代了社会主义改造的政策
    在私营工商业全行业合营的高潮中，有些资本家的家属仍然是有顾虑的。她们普遍关心的是丈夫的工作安排和家属的生活问题。针对这种情况，我们广泛地展开了资本家家属的工作，向她们讲清社会主义前途和妇女解放的关系，结合她们的切身利益，反复地交代政策。她们普遍认为吃了“定心丸”，表示愿意积极接受改造。有的家属更帮助清产估价，鼓励亲属搞好公私关系，守职尽责，服从领导。在这期间，资本家家属组织了一千五百人的工作队，开展宣传活动，对有顾虑的家属挨户访问，进行具体的说服解释工作。经过社会主义改造高潮的实际教育，原来的积极分子更为积极，中间分子向积极方面转变，落后分子大为减少了。好多人过去怕沾上我们，现在怕和我们沾不上，积极向我们靠拢。有的参加街道工作，有的作了扫盲教师，有的出来办托儿所、托儿站。据目前所知，她们办的托儿所已有十八处，收托孩子八百多名，将要开办的还有三处。一些有文化、有技术的家属，有了参加工作的要求，有的并已走上了工作岗位。目前，为了进一步做好对资本家家属的工作，组织了七千八百多人分别参加理论、政治的学习。各种学习班、组的出席率一般在百分之九十以上，风雨无阻，学习情绪很好。
    以上就是我们进行资本家家属工作的过程。可以看出：在我国社会情况急剧变化的条件下，经过了我们的连续不断的工作，在资产阶级妇女中发生了重大的变化。而这一部分人，由于阶级的限制和生活范围的狭小和闭塞，因而她们的认识和觉悟都很低。
    如果说妇女解放是社会解放的标志，那么，资产阶级妇女的这种变化，也就确切地表现了中国民族资产阶级在我党正确政策之下所发生的变化。
    培养和扩大资本家家属中的积极分子队伍
    在对资本家家属的工作中，培养积极分子，培养骨干是十分重要的。应该不断扩大积极分子的队伍，使她们起带头作用、桥梁作用和骨干作用，带动中间与落后的分子一起接受改造。因为我们对资本家家属进行工作的干部毕竟是少数，同时又要照顾她们与其他妇女群众不同的特点和要求，就必须从她们之中发现与培养积极分子去进行家属的工作，这是必要的和有效的方法。
    我们虽然对资本家家属进行了一些工作，但是还是很不够的。为了进一步团结和改造她们，党要加强领导，教育党员干部特别是妇女干部深刻认识这一工作的重要性，克服怕失掉立场或嫌麻烦的思想，认真研究党的政策，继续研究资本家家属的特点，及时掌握她们的思想情况，不懈地对她们进行教育、改造工作，使她们在社会主义改造和建设事业中，发挥出更为有益的作用。
