　　Sighing at the Sight of Books
　　He Mu

　　Mr. Wen Yiduo spent more than ten years amidst the "paper fragrance of ancient books." Thirty years ago, Mr. Zheng Zhenduo went to Paris, originally intending to stay for only a few days, but because the "National Library" there had a rich collection of Chinese novels and operas, he lingered for several months. The charm of books for scholars is indeed great!

　　However, before liberation, scholars often lamented the difficulty of obtaining books. Like Tianyi Pavilion, the oldest library in China, although it contains many precious cultural classics, scholars could only "sigh at the gate" because the library was closed all year round and refused visitors. It was also one of the abnormal phenomena of old China that research on Chinese classical novels and operas led to disappointment at home, and scholars instead sought them in several major European libraries.

　　"Before the army marches, provisions go first." The supply of books and materials should precede scientific research. Although major libraries in China are currently going all out, experts and scholars still feel that "provisions" are insufficient. According to the "stocktaking" of public libraries across the country, the backlog of books and materials is serious. Of the total collection of only 30 million volumes, 10 million volumes are backlogged. Beijing has three million volumes of books "shelved high," Hunan has 400,000 volumes of books "hidden in famous mountains," and the Nanjing Library also has one million volumes of books sleeping in boxes. Some precious books and periodicals are covered in layers of dust, and because they have been stored in airtight libraries for many years, some have already "crumbled to dust and cannot be revived." Although scholars and experts can now enter libraries and book repositories, they can only face the vast sea of books and feel helpless because catalogs have not yet been compiled and the strict rules and regulations for borrowing books have not been abolished.

　　Scholars used to "sigh at the gate," but now they "sigh at the sight of books." When will the sighing end?

    望书兴叹
    禾木
    闻一多先生曾在“古书的纸香”中度过了十多年的岁月。郑振铎先生三十年前曾到巴黎，本只打算小住几天，但因那里的“国家图书馆”对中国的小说与戏曲收罗宏富，以致使他流连了几个月。书对学者的魅力，可谓大矣哉！
    然而解放前，学者们时常感叹得书之不易。像我国历史最悠久的藏书楼——天一阁，虽藏有许多珍贵的文化典籍，但由于书楼终年关闭，谢绝参观，学者们只有“望门兴叹”。研究中国的古典小说戏曲，在国内感到失望，反而求诸欧洲的几个大图书馆，这也是旧中国的畸形现象之一。
     “大军未发，粮草先行”，图书资料的供应应走在科学研究的前面。当前国内各大图书馆虽已全力以赴，但专家学者仍感“粮草”不足。根据国内的公共图书馆“摸家底”的情况来看，图书资料的积压情况是严重的。全部藏书不过三千万册，就有一千万册被积压。北京有三百万册图书“束之高阁”，湖南有四十万册图书“藏之名山”，南京图书馆也有一百万册图书睡在箱子里。有些珍贵书刊，灰尘层积，由于长年藏在不透气的书库里，有些已经“粉身碎骨，不能复苏”了。藏书楼、书库，专家学者现在虽能进去，但由于目录还没编出来，借书的清规戒律还未破除，他们也只能面对着浩如烟海的图书而无可奈何。
    学者们过去“望门兴叹”，现在又“望书兴叹”，叹声何时能了？
