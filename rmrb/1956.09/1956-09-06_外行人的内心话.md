    An Outsider's Heartfelt Words
    Fang Yin

    A poem (lyrics) set to music is not necessarily a good poem; however, a good poem should be able to be set to music.

    The collaboration between a poet and a composer should be reflected in the "seamlessness" of the lyrics and the music.

    Although lyrics (words) are the instructions for the music (notes), they cannot cover up the disharmony of the melody; although the music is the soul of the lyrics, it cannot obscure the conceptualization of the lyrics themselves.

    I have had the above superficial thoughts for some time, and after listening to several concerts, I have gained some strong confirmation.

    The singer must be immersed and burn in the song he sings. He should be the re-creator of the lyrics and music. If not, even with the best "voice," it is difficult to infect and ignite the audience with his singing.

    The "Evening Waltz" performed by the Beijing delegation during the Music Week was originally a light, lively, and joyful tune. But unfortunately, it was sung a little blandly, and that light, lively, joyful emotion was not fully expressed. I think this may be because the singer was not immersed and burning in the song.

      "Clear articulation" should be one of the primary conditions for vocal music. Otherwise, whether it is a solo, a unison, or a chorus, it will give people a feeling of "a wall of sound." If the singer only sings the song as "a wall of sound," then the important meaning of singing is lost.

    In this regard, some of our singers should seriously learn from the older generation of singers and the old artists in the opera world.

      "Jialing River Boatman's Song" and "Li River Boatman's Song" are two very popular choruses. They fully express the brave spirit of the boatmen in those two places in their struggle against dangerous shoals and the joyful mood of overcoming them. Listening to such songs, we seem to be on a boat on the Jialing River or the Li River, and our hearts rise and fall with the singing; those strong arms, those eyes of the old helmsman staring firmly ahead, the boats flying in the rapids and drifting on the calm water..., all vividly appear before us.

    I believe that these two choruses are successful examples in the collection and arrangement of folk music, as well as in song production and performance. I hope that musicians will create more and better songs like this for us.

    外行人的内心话

    被谱成曲子的诗（歌词），不一定是好诗；好诗却应该是可以谱曲的。
    诗人和作曲家的合作，应该表现在歌词同曲谱的“天衣无缝”上。
    歌词（文字）虽然是曲谱（音符）的说明书，但不能掩盖曲调的不和谐；曲谱虽然是歌词的灵魂，但也遮蔽不住歌词本身的概念化。
    平日就有以上几点粗浅的想法，听了几次音乐会以后，更得到了一些有力的印证。
    歌唱者必须沉浸、燃烧在他所歌唱的歌曲里。他应该是歌词和曲谱的再创造者。不如此，即令具有再好不过的“歌喉”，也很难以他的歌唱去感染听众，燃烧听众。
    音乐周中北京代表团演出的“晚会圆舞曲”本是一个轻快、活泼、充满欢愉感情的调子。但可惜它被唱得平淡了些，那种轻快、活泼、欢愉的感情没有被充分地表达出来。我想，这也许就是由于歌唱者没有沉浸、燃烧在歌曲里的缘故。
      “咬字清楚”应该是声乐的首要条件之一。不然，无论是独唱也好，齐唱、合唱也好，都会使人听起来发生“一片声”之感。歌唱者如果把歌曲只唱成“一片声”，那就失去了歌唱的重要意义了。
    在这方面，我们的一些歌唱者，应该向老一辈的歌唱家以及戏曲界的老艺人们认真学习。
      “嘉陵江号子”和“澧水船夫号子”是两个极受欢迎的合唱。它们充分表现出两处船民和险滩奋斗的勇敢精神和战胜险滩的欢愉心情。听着这样的歌，我们仿佛置身在嘉陵江或澧水的船上，心也随着歌声起落；那粗壮的臂膀，那坚毅地盯着前方的老舵手的眼睛，那在激流中飞翻又在平静的水面上漂去的船儿……，都鲜明地出现在我们面前了。
    我以为，这两个合唱是在收集、整理民间乐曲上，以及在歌曲制作和演唱上的成功的例子。愿音乐家们，给我们创造出这样的更多更好的歌曲来。
