Xinhua News Agency report: Chinese engineers have recently completed the final design of a set of cotton fabric printing and dyeing machines that are close to the advanced technical level of the world. Most of these machines use electrical control and automatic adjustment, and are composed of fifty-three types of machines. Some components have already begun trial production, and some have been put into production. It is expected that the complete set of printing and dyeing machines will be basically completed by trial production next year.

The design of cotton fabric printing and dyeing machines is relatively complex. It is the last type of textile printing and dyeing machine to be designed. After the design and trial production of this set of printing and dyeing machines are successful, all kinds of machinery and equipment needed by China's cotton textile industry can be supplied domestically.

In the past few years, the Chinese textile machinery engineering community has designed and successfully trial-produced more than fifty kinds of various spinning and weaving machines. Most of these machines use electrical control and automatic devices, and the effect of their use is quite good.

At present, China's first four-roller ring spinning frame is officially undergoing trial operation. After the successful trial production of this machine, a spinning mill with 100,000 spindles can use at least forty fewer roving frames than in the past. This is because this ring spinning frame can spin roving that is forty to fifty times larger than yarn into yarn in one step, while in the past it could only spin roving that was fifteen to twenty-five times larger than yarn into yarn.

Although China's cotton textile industry has a history of more than sixty years, before 1949, China only had some textile machinery repair shops and had never manufactured complete sets of textile machinery. After 1950, the Ministry of Textile Industry began to transform some machinery repair shops for the production of textile machinery, and at the same time, two new textile machinery manufacturing plants with relatively large scales were built. From the production of the first set of textile machines in 1951 to the present, nearly two million spindles of spinning machines and more than 40,000 looms have been manufactured. Now, all kinds of cotton textile machines needed for new construction and expansion in China can be completely self-supplied, and a part can also be exported.

### 我国棉纺织机设计工作的一项新成就  一套棉布印染机的最后设计已经完成

    我国棉纺织机设计工作的一项新成就
    一套棉布印染机的最后设计已经完成
    据新华社讯　中国的工程师最近完成了一套接近世界先进技术水平的棉布印染机最后一部分设计。这些机器大部分采用电气控制和自动调节，由五十三种机器组成。有些组成部分已经开始试制，其中有些已经投入生产。预计全套印染机将在明年基本上试制完成。
    棉布印染机的设计比较复杂。它是各种纺织印染机器中最后设计出来的一种。这套印染机设计和试制成功以后，中国棉纺织工业所需要的各种机器设备，全部都可以由国内供应了。
    这几年来中国纺织机械工程界已经设计和试制成功五十多种各种纺纱、织布机器。这些机器大部分采用了电气控制和自动装置，使用的效果相当好。
    目前，我国的第一台四罗拉细纱机正式试车。这种机器的试制成功以后，一个十万纱锭的纺纱厂至少可以比过去少用四十台粗纱机。因为这种细纱机可以把大于细纱四十至五十倍的粗纱一次纺成细纱，而过去却只能把大于细纱十五至二十五倍的粗纱纺成细纱。
    我国的棉纺织工业虽然已经有六十多年的历史，但是在1949年以前，我国只有一些纺织机械修配厂，从来没有制造过成套的纺织机械。1950年以后，纺织工业部开始把一些机械修配厂加以改造，用来生产纺织机械，同时又新建了两个规模比较大的纺织机械制造厂。从1951年出产第一套纺织机到现在，已经制造了近二百万锭纺纱机，四万多台织布机。现在，国内新建和扩建所需要的各种棉纺织机，已能全部自给，并且还可以有一部分出口。
