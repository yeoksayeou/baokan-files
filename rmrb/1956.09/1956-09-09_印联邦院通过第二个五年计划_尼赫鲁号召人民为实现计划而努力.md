Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, September 8th: The Indian Parliament's Federal Council unanimously passed Prime Minister Nehru's motion regarding the Second Five-Year Plan on September 7th, expressing "general agreement with the principles, goals, and progress of development contained in the Second Five-Year Plan drafted by the Planning Commission." Prime Minister Nehru, in concluding the debate, called on the people to earnestly implement this plan. In this regard, he drew everyone's attention to the enormous work being carried out by the Chinese people in national construction. Currently, the entire country of China is tirelessly striving to realize its plan.

India's Second Five-Year Plan requires an expenditure of 48 billion rupees (approximately 25 billion Renminbi), of which 24 billion rupees will be raised by the central and provincial (state) governments "through taxation, borrowing, and other income." It is proposed to use a fiscal deficit to make up for 12 billion rupees, and to raise 8 billion rupees "from foreign financial sources," with the hope that the remaining 4 billion rupees can be "compensated for by further increasing domestic financial resources." The plan states that "the only possible sources for making up this difference are taxes and, to the extent possible, profits from public enterprises." In the Second Five-Year Plan, the allocation for industry and mining is 8.9 billion rupees, accounting for 18.5% of the total; the allocation for agriculture and rural development is 5.68 billion rupees, accounting for 11.8% of the total. The transportation industry receives the largest allocation, with a total of 13.85 billion rupees, accounting for 28.9% of the total. This category includes railways, highways, shipping, ports, civil aviation, and post and telecommunications.

The target for grain production is set at 75 million tons, an increase of 15% compared to the output achieved during the First Five-Year Plan. However, recently, the Indian government is preparing to increase this target by another 25%, resulting in a 40% increase compared to the output of the First Five-Year Plan. The target for steel production is 4.3 million tons, an increase of 231% compared to the output of the First Five-Year Plan. The target for the production of railway locomotives is set at 400, an increase of 129% compared to the output of the First Five-Year Plan. The production of other items such as cement, chemicals, machine tools, and textile machinery is also planned to be increased.

    印联邦院通过第二个五年计划
    尼赫鲁号召人民为实现计划而努力
    新华社新德里8日电　印度国会联邦院9月7日一致通过了尼赫鲁总理提出的关于第二个五年计划的议案，表示“一般同意计划委员会所拟订的第二个五年计划中所包含的发展的原则、目标和进度”。尼赫鲁总理在结束辩论时号召人民热诚地实现这个计划。在这方面，他提请大家注意，中国人民在国家建设方面所进行的巨大工作，目前，中国整个国家都在不倦地努力实现他们的计划。
    印度的第二个五年计划需要支出四百八十亿卢比（约合人民币二百五十亿元），其中二百四十亿卢比将由中央和各省（邦）政府“通过税收，借款和其他收入”来筹措。有人建议用财政赤字来弥补一百二十亿卢比，再“从国外的财源”筹措八十亿卢比，其余的四十亿卢比则希望“用再增加国内的财源的办法来弥补”。计划表明，“可以弥补这项差额的唯一可能的来源是税收和在可能范围内的公营企业的利润”。在第二个五年计划中，工业和矿业拨款为八十九亿卢比，占总额的18.5％，农业和农村发展的拨款是五十六亿八千万卢比，占总额的11.8％。交通运输业拨款最多，这个项目包括铁路、公路、航运、口岸和港口、民用航空和邮电，拨款共达一百三十八亿五千万卢比，占总额的28.9％。
    谷物生产的指标定为七千五百万吨，比第一个五年计划期间所达到的产量增加15％。但是在最近，印度政府正准备把这个指标再提高25％，这样就比第一个五年计划的产量增加40％。钢材产量的指标是四百三十万吨，这比第一个五年计划的产量提高231％。铁路机车的产量的指标定为四百辆，比第一个五年计划的产量增加129％。其他如水泥、化学品、工作母机、纺织机器等的产量同样也规定要提高。
