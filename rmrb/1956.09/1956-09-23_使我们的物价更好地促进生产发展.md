Speech by Comrade Li Xiannian, Vice Premier of the State Council and Minister of Finance

I fully agree with Comrade Mao Zedong's opening speech and the Central Committee's political report, the report on amending the Party Constitution, and the report on the proposal for the Second Five-Year Plan for National Economic Development. I would now like to express some opinions on the current market price issue.

    I. Four Major Achievements in Stabilizing Prices

When studying China's price policy, it is necessary to examine the historical conditions that determined market prices. In the early days of liberation, after twelve years of war and prolonged inflation, the people were uneasy about currency devaluation and price fluctuations; the war and price fluctuations greatly damaged industrial and agricultural production; the difference between industrial and agricultural product prices widened significantly; at the same time, capitalist industry and commerce still accounted for a large proportion of the country, they were accustomed to speculation, and the state's economic control over the market was still weak. This was the situation we faced at that time. Obviously, without immediately stopping speculative activities and resolutely stabilizing market prices, it would be impossible to stabilize people's lives and restore and develop production. In response to this situation, the Party timely adopted the policy of resolutely stabilizing prices, first stabilizing various prices at the current level, and then, on this basis, making some necessary adjustments to facilitate the development of production and the requirements for utilizing, restricting, and transforming capitalist industry and commerce.

What has been the result of implementing this policy over the past few years?

(1) Market prices are basically stable. Prices began to stabilize in March 1950. Subsequently, the state had to support the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea and invest considerable resources in production and construction. Under the situation of "stabilizing, resisting, and building simultaneously," market prices have always maintained a stable situation. Especially after 1952, when the economy basically recovered, the land reform was completed, and the Korean War ended, prices were definitely stabilized. This is a major victory for the Party on the economic front, and this victory created the necessary prerequisite for a series of subsequent victories on the economic front.

(2) The purchase prices of major agricultural products and the price ratios between them are basically appropriate. After prices stabilized, the state reasonably adjusted the purchase prices of major agricultural products such as grain, cotton, tobacco, and sugarcane. The commodity volume of these agricultural products accounts for approximately 70 percent of the total agricultural commodity volume of approximately 20 billion yuan. Setting these commodity prices appropriately is conducive to encouraging farmers to increase production.

(3) The price difference between industrial and agricultural products has narrowed. Due to the basic stability of industrial product sales prices and the appropriate increase in the purchase prices of major agricultural products, the price difference between industrial and agricultural products has gradually narrowed over the past few years. According to the statistics of 107 products in 118 county-level and below markets in 24 provinces and regions in 1955, the price difference between industrial and agricultural products narrowed by 17.25 percent compared with 1950. Farmers can exchange the same amount of agricultural products for more industrial products than in the past. This means that in addition to benefiting from land reform and production development, and in addition to getting rid of usury exploitation and the short measures and adulteration of private merchants, farmers have also gained certain benefits from prices, which is conducive to consolidating the worker-peasant alliance.

(4) It has cooperated with the implementation of the policies of utilizing, restricting, and transforming capitalist industry and commerce. Over the past few years, through processing orders and unified purchase and sales for capitalist industry, on the one hand, they have been able to obtain reasonable profits, and on the other hand, their excessive and inappropriate profits have been restricted. For capitalist commerce, the method of reducing regional price differences and wholesale and retail price differences has prevented wholesalers from engaging in long-distance operations and large retailers from obtaining excessive profits. These measures have been conducive to the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce and have played their historical role.

By the way, in the past few years, in terms of the prices of major agricultural products, in order to oppose hoarding and waiting for higher prices, the state has also taken measures to gradually reduce and finally completely eliminate seasonal price differences, and at that time, it eliminated seasonal price differences on the basis of the highest price of the year or close to the highest price of the year, which actually increased the purchase prices of these agricultural products and increased farmers' income. In terms of sales, the state did not increase the sales prices of agricultural products as a result. Storing these agricultural products originally had certain losses, expenses, interest, and profits, and a certain seasonal price difference should have been there, but the state sold these agricultural products at the same price throughout the year. This is one of the reasons why the state generally does not make money and even loses money in operating grain and certain agricultural products.

In short, judging from the results of the above implementation, it should be said that the Party's price policy is correct, and the result of implementing this policy is basically successful.

    II. Six Problems with Prices Currently

It should be admitted that the price stabilization in the early days of liberation was stabilized on the basis of the existing prices at that time, and the prices at that time were not completely reasonable. In the middle of implementation, we often focused more on the stability side and did not pay enough attention to the timely and reasonable adjustment side. At the same time, the economic and political situation in China has undergone fundamental changes in the past seven years, production has developed, the transportation network has expanded, and the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce has basically been realized. Under the new situation, some originally reasonable prices and various price differences can no longer meet the requirements of the actual situation. In addition, commercial price departments also have many shortcomings and errors in terms of stipulating prices and mastering the system. Therefore, there are many problems with prices, and it is only natural that all parties have opinions on this. The problems with prices are roughly as follows:

(1) The overall price level is stable, but the prices of some non-staple foods are rising. Starting in 1953, the scale of national construction expanded, cities developed, the number of employed people increased, and people's purchasing power increased. At that time, state-owned commerce had not vigorously operated non-staple foods, so there was a shortage of supply and rising prices of non-staple foods such as vegetables, meat, oil, and tofu. Since 1954, attention has been paid to this aspect of work, and some measures have been taken, but the supply of non-staple foods is generally still quite tight, and some non-staple foods have not been stabilized as they should be when calculated based on the average annual price.

(2) Although the purchase prices of major agricultural products are appropriate, the purchase prices of some agricultural products are still too low. The purchase prices of tung oil and tea oil are still lower than the pre-war level compared with grain prices; although the purchase price of rapeseed is roughly equivalent to the pre-war price ratio with grain, the yield per unit area of ​​grain has increased in recent years, and the yield per unit area of ​​cotton has increased even more, while the yield per unit area of ​​rapeseed, except for individual areas, has not increased but has decreased compared with the pre-war period. Farmers are not as profitable from growing rapeseed as they are from growing grain and cotton; although the purchase price of pigs is already about 10 percent higher than the pre-war price ratio with grain, the conditions for raising pigs have changed after agricultural cooperation. In the past, farmers could raise pigs without making money, but now agricultural cooperatives must calculate costs when raising pigs, and agricultural cooperative members must also compare raising pigs with the conditions of participating in collective labor for work points and remuneration. In this way, the original price seems low; in addition, the purchase prices of peanuts, sesame, tea, and silkworm cocoons in some areas are also low. Currently, the output of these products has not reached the pre-war level in many areas. Although the number of pigs raised has increased compared with the pre-war period, the rate of increase has not kept up with the growth of urban and rural people's needs. This situation is related to the low purchase prices, which cannot stimulate the enthusiasm for production.

(3) The state generally does not make money from operating agricultural and sideline products, but the price difference between local purchases and local sales of some commodities is too large. For example, in many places, the purchase price of oilseeds is low, the sales price of edible oil is high, and oil cakes are even more expensive than oilseeds; in many places, the difference between the purchase price of live pigs and the sales price of pork is too large, and farmers are very dissatisfied with selling pigs at low prices and buying meat at high prices. This is unreasonable. The formation of these price differences is sometimes due to the result of mechanically calculating according to the pricing formula in error; some are due to long-distance transportation, remote processing, excessive operating links, and excessive costs; some are also due to high taxes and excessive commercial profits of some commodities.

(4) Some mountainous and remote areas are far from the purchasing points, and transportation is very inconvenient. The state needs to subsidize the transportation costs of agricultural products transported from these areas. We have not paid enough attention to this aspect in the past, and as a result, the purchase prices of agricultural products in these areas are low, farmers' incomes are very low, and they have to be sent dozens of miles away, and they have a lot of opinions.

(5) In terms of quality price differences, the policy of paying higher prices for better quality has not been seriously implemented, and policies to encourage new products have not been adopted. Therefore, it cannot stimulate the improvement of industrial product quality, cannot effectively encourage the increase of industrial product varieties, but has instead contributed to the reduction of varieties and the decline in quality. Some commodities that were easy to buy in the past are now unavailable, and some commodities that were of good quality in the past have deteriorated. This is actually a disguised price increase for consumers. In addition, there are also inappropriate provisions for quality standards and grade price differences in agricultural product purchases, especially farmers have many opinions on the phenomenon of grade suppression and price reduction by some of our purchasing agencies.

(6) In terms of regional price differences, the following issues are more prominent: one is that in the past, some areas such as the Southwest and Northwest had lower agricultural product prices and higher industrial product prices due to transportation conditions and historical reasons, and the regional price differences were large; now that the railway has been built and the conditions have changed, this excessive price difference seems unreasonable (some adjustments have been made to varying degrees recently). One is that in the past, the regional price differences of industrial products were generally calculated with the main producing area as the central starting point. The prices in the main producing areas were low, and the prices in other areas were high. Now, in some places, industry has developed, and their products can not only meet the needs of the local area, but also meet the needs of other areas that meet the direction of commodity circulation. For example, certain types of yarn in Xi'an can already meet the needs of the Northwest provinces. Under this circumstance, it is unreasonable to continue to maintain the regional price difference calculated from Shanghai in the past. Another is that some places mechanically calculate the purchase prices of agricultural products from the prices in the distribution centers, deduct the costs at each level, and calculate the prices in the producing areas, making the purchase prices of agricultural products in these areas too low and deviating from the reasonable price ratio with grain. This violates the principle of sales area prices being subordinate to production area prices.

The above are the main problems with prices currently. Overall, since the liberation of the whole country, the prices of agricultural and industrial products in China can be summarized into the following three situations: (1) The prices of major commodities were appropriate in the past, and they still seem appropriate now. (2) The prices of some commodities were appropriate in the past, but they are no longer appropriate now. (3) The prices of a few commodities were inappropriate in the past, and they have not been adjusted yet. An important reason why these inappropriate or already inappropriate prices have not been discovered and adjusted in a timely manner is because there is generally no price competition from other parties in China, and the problems are not easily exposed. Of course, changes in the situation, our lack of experience, and insufficient listening to the voices of all parties are also reasons. It should be recognized that socialist commerce has almost become the only commerce in China, and price policy has a particularly important position in state-owned commerce. Whether the prices are stipulated appropriately or not will more directly and widely affect production, affect people's consumption and national accumulation. In the past few years, we have not seriously studied prices and summarized experience, and this situation cannot continue.

    III. Seven Measures to Adjust Prices

In order to solve the problems existing in prices and make our prices better adapt to the objective situation, we believe that under the basic principle of stabilizing prices, the following measures should be taken based on the principle of being conducive to the development of production and commodity circulation, and taking into account both national accumulation and people's consumption:

(1) Increase the purchase prices of live pigs, rapeseed, tung oil, and tea oil by a relatively large margin, and appropriately increase the purchase prices of sesame, tea, and peanuts and silkworm cocoons in some areas.

(2) For commodities purchased and sold locally, the purchase and sales price differences that are too large should be appropriately reduced; and the processing and operation of grain, oilseeds, brewing, and milling should be appropriately decentralized, small processing workshops in rural towns should be restored, long-distance transportation and remote processing should be reduced, and costs should be reduced, and the supply of feed in rural areas can also be increased.

(3) In mountainous and remote areas where transportation is very inconvenient, when purchasing agricultural and sideline products that need to be transported out, take the method of subsidizing freight, that is, providing appropriate subsidies from the freight aspect to farmers who transport over longer distances.

(4) Appropriately increase the purchase prices of miscellaneous grains. Grain prices in the whole country generally do not change. The purchase prices of grain in individual areas where grain prices are slightly low can be gradually adjusted.

(5) Revise inappropriate quality standards and grade price differences for agricultural products, and correct the wrong practices of grade suppression and price reduction in agricultural product purchases. The quality standards and grade price differences stipulated by the state should be widely publicized to the masses; when inspecting and grading, the mass line method should be adopted, and experienced agricultural cooperative members should be organized to grade and classify themselves, and then the state purchasing agency should review and inspect, and negotiate and decide. The state purchasing agency can also stipulate a "tolerance" for grade inspection, allowing a certain error rate in grade inspection, so as to avoid the tendency of purchasing personnel often being afraid of taking responsibility and suppressing grades and reducing prices.

(6) Resolutely implement the policy of pricing according to quality and paying higher prices for better quality, so that factories that produce good products can be rewarded from prices, and factories that produce bad products can be spurred on from prices. Adopt effective reward methods for new products, so that the increased costs incurred by factories for trial-producing new products can be compensated, and designers and all employees can be appropriately encouraged. At the same time, commercial departments should also resolutely implement the policy of paying higher prices for better quality in sales prices, and authorize the local people's committees to approve the price reduction and handling of damaged and deteriorated goods.

(7) Appropriately adjust the regional price differences of industrial products to make the price differences of industrial products between various regions reach a generally reasonable level. Due to changes in transportation conditions, if the regional price differences in some areas are too large and need to be adjusted, the prices of industrial products in these areas can be appropriately reduced to gradually reach a reasonable level; it can also be considered to appropriately reduce the prices of industrial products in these areas, while appropriately increasing the prices of industrial products in some other areas, adjusting them on both sides to reach a reasonable level. If the regional price differences of industrial products have become too large due to changes in production conditions, as long as local products can already meet local needs and can meet all the needs of other relevant areas according to the direction of commodity circulation, under the condition of the same quality, the past method of calculating prices from the old producing area can be changed, and the prices in these areas can be gradually aligned with the old producing area.

It should be said that the main purpose of several measures regarding agricultural and sideline products is to stimulate the increase in production of agricultural and sideline products, especially to increase the supply of non-staple foods. The purchase prices of these agricultural and sideline products have increased, and the sales prices of some products should be increased accordingly. However, considering that some products and their manufactured products are daily necessities for the people, the sales prices are currently not suitable for change in order to avoid excessively affecting the lives of the broad masses of the people. So what should we do in this case? First, try to reduce operating links and reduce commercial costs as much as possible, and find a way out from improving work. This should be a regular measure for socialist enterprises; second, the state can consider reducing the tax rates on these agricultural products and reducing the profits of state-owned commercial operations of these agricultural products. This is a temporary measure taken under special circumstances. Will the above measures cause other cash crops to compete with grain for land, thereby reducing grain production? This is a question that must be considered. Silkworm cocoons and peanuts are only raised in price in some non-concentrated producing areas and not in the whole country, which is based on this consideration; tung oil, tea oil, and tea generally do not have the problem of competing with grain for land; the biggest impact on grain is mainly rapeseed. We estimate that after the price of rapeseed is raised, the provinces in the Yangtze River Basin may reduce tens of thousands of mu of wheat fields and increase tens of thousands of mu of rapeseed. However, historically, these areas were rapeseed producing areas. Since the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War, the planting area of ​​rapeseed has been squeezed out by wheat, and the wheat in these areas is of poor quality and has a low flour yield. At the same time, because the rapeseed production has decreased, a lot of soybeans have to be used to extract oil. And because of this, another bad consequence has been brought about, that is, the supply of tofu in urban and rural markets has decreased after soybeans are extracted for oil. Everyone knows that it is a big problem for Chinese people to not have green vegetables and tofu to eat. It can be imagined that if we can increase 1 billion catties of rapeseed, this will not only make it possible for us to alleviate the tension in the supply of edible oil to a certain extent, but also make it possible for us to replace more than 2 billion catties of soybeans to appropriately meet the needs of the people throughout the country for tofu. Doing so is beneficial in all aspects. As for the reduced wheat, it can be compensated by trying to increase the yield per unit area of ​​wheat in the northern provinces. In addition, grain prices are the main body of all agricultural product prices and the center of market prices. Any change in grain prices will inevitably affect the entire market prices. Therefore, the adjustment of grain prices must be carried out with caution; individual places that need to be adjusted can only be carried out in stages and batches.

    IV. Other Issues

Although the specific range of price adjustments and the steps for adjustment still need to be designed and calculated in detail and reported to the Central Committee for decision; but in general, several measures in the area of ​​agricultural products require the state to spend more money, and many of the measures in the area of ​​industrial products require the state to collect less money. Whether it is raising purchase prices or lowering sales prices, whether it is reducing tax rates or reducing commercial profits, the result is a reduction in the state's fiscal revenue. Preliminary estimates show that the annual reduction is approximately between 1 billion and 2 billion yuan. Of course, these price adjustments can greatly promote the development of production, and the development of production is also conducive to increasing fiscal revenue. But in fact, both developing production and increasing income require a process, while the reduction in fiscal revenue will occur immediately. For example, if the tax revenue and profits per pig are reduced by two-thirds, it would be necessary to increase the number of pigs raised to three times, that is, from the current 100 million to 300 million, in order to make up for this reduction in revenue from developing pig raising. This is only possible after a large increase in grain production and is obviously not achievable in the short term.

If fiscal revenue is reduced, fiscal expenditure must also be reduced accordingly. According to the principle of balancing fiscal revenue and expenditure, there are not many ways out other than increasing production and practicing economy. This will inevitably have some impact on the proportion between industry and agriculture, heavy industry and light industry, and national construction and people's consumption. If the state raises the purchase prices of agricultural products and spends more money in this area, and farmers' income increases and purchasing power increases, in addition to supplying means of production and guiding farmers to expand production, more consumer goods are needed to supply the increased consumption needs of farmers. In this way, it is necessary to increase the proportion of some light industrial investments and appropriately change the proportion of some heavy industrial investments and other aspects of expenditure. Under the condition of ensuring a high rate of development of China's industry, some necessary adjustments should be made to adapt to changes in the situation. I think that our country, which has won the revolution, should, as long as there is an environment that allows us to carry out peaceful construction, base the national plan on a foundation that is both active and stable and reliable, according to needs and possibilities. Of course, the policy of national industrialization and giving priority to the development of heavy industry to strengthen national defense represents the fundamental interests of the people of the whole country. We are an economically backward country and need to work diligently and frugally to build; we are also threatened by imperialism, and China's territory, Taiwan, has not been liberated. We cannot harm the long-term and fundamental interests of the people by excessively meeting the immediate interests of the people. If we do that, one day the people will turn around and complain about us. The seven measures mentioned here are only limited adjustments based on the specific situation. I think they do not violate the policy of national industrialization and giving priority to the development of heavy industry to strengthen national defense, and in the long run, doing so is even more conducive to the implementation of this policy. I believe that the above-mentioned principles of adjustment can be affirmed, but the specific scope of adjustment and the steps for adjustment should take care of all aspects in a comprehensive manner when considering them. The boundaries are: both national construction and individual consumption should be taken into account; both the purchasing power of the people should be increased, and attention should be paid to the balance of material supply. Any one-sided emphasis is wrong. It is also unrealistic to demand that it be done completely reasonably all at once, regardless of priorities.

Why not adopt the policy of reducing the prices of industrial products every year?

Here, I would like to explain some of these issues. Recently, we have been constantly receiving letters from cadres and workers from various places, asking why China does not adopt the policy of generally reducing the prices of industrial products every year, but adopts the policy of basically stabilizing the prices of industrial products? I think that first of all, this is not because we subjectively do not want to generally reduce the prices of industrial products, but because objectively there are no conditions for generally reducing the prices of industrial products. Our light industrial products are restricted by agricultural raw materials. Except for a very small number of products, they are not in oversupply but are very insufficient. Under this circumstance, if we rudely reduce prices generally, serious out-of-stock situations will inevitably occur. The result will either be forced to raise prices again, or people will not be able to buy goods and black markets will appear, or the state will be forced to expand the scope of planned supply. In the final analysis, price reduction is just empty talk. In 1953, we once thought that there were too many materials and we had to reduce prices for sale, but as a result, many commodities were out of stock and we had to raise prices again. We have had such lessons. At the same time, it should be said that expanding the market, stimulating production, and improving people's lives by reducing the prices of industrial products is one method, and increasing the wages of workers and appropriately increasing the purchase prices of some agricultural and sideline products is also a method. Which method to adopt should be handled according to the specific situation. Under the current specific situation in China, adopting the latter method has an even more advantageous effect, that is, it can more directly stimulate the production enthusiasm of workers and is more conducive to developing production according to the needs of the country. The main purpose of the price measures we have proposed this time is first to develop production and to make prices more reasonable. Of course, doing so is also of great benefit to improving people's lives.

Why can't some commodities adopt the method of small profits and quick turnover?

Some comrades asked why we have not adopted the method of small profits and quick turnover for some commodities? This is because the price of a commodity depends on the specific conditions of the commodity. Commodities with sufficient raw materials, sufficient equipment, and sufficient output should have lower profits and more sales. Conversely, commodities with insufficient raw materials, difficult to expand equipment in a short time, and products that cannot be fully supplied, if they also implement small profits and quick turnover, the result can only be "small profits and out of stock." And when stipulating commodity prices, we should also consider the importance of different commodities to people's consumption and national accumulation. We have a few profits or even no profits for some commodities; the state can have a little more accumulation for some commodities. Therefore, we should recognize that a purely profit-making viewpoint is wrong; but it is also wrong to demand small profits and quick turnover indiscriminately without looking at the conditions. In the past few years, the purchasing power of the people in China has increased, and the supply of commodities can generally adapt to the needs of the market. There is basically no black market in the industrial product market, and except for a few non-staple foods that are in short supply, there is basically no phenomenon of panic buying. This shows that the method of adopting the policy of basically stabilizing the prices of industrial products and appropriately considering the principle of the approximate balance between the purchasing power of the people and the supply of commodities to stipulate the prices of industrial products is feasible. By the way, the agricultural products that we purchase under the unified purchase system, such as grain and cotton, after the unified purchase is over, farmers are still willing to sell to the state at the same price. The part of the farmers' transactions in the market is not far from the state's unified purchase and sales price, indicating that this price policy is easily accepted by farmers and is also feasible.

In summary, there are four achievements, six problems, and seven measures proposed. These are just preliminary opinions. The price issue is a very complex issue, involving a wide range of issues, and must be considered carefully. Whether these opinions are appropriate, please correct me.

### 使我们的物价更好地促进生产发展

1956-09-23

专栏：

    使我们的物价更好地促进生产发展
    国务院副总理、财政部部长　李先念同志的发言
    我完全同意毛泽东同志的开幕词和中央委员会的政治报告、修改党章的报告、发展国民经济第二个五年计划的建议的报告。现在只对当前的市场物价问题，发表一点意见。
    一　稳定物价的四大成绩
    在研究我国物价政策的时候，必须考察一下决定市场物价的历史条件。解放初期，我国经过十二年的战争和长期的通货膨胀，人民日夜不安于货币贬值和物价波动的痛苦；战争和物价的波动，使工农业生产受到很大的破坏；使工业品同农产品比价的差额大为扩大；同时资本主义工商业当时在全国范围内还占着很大的比重，他们习惯于投机倒把，而国家从经济上支配市场的力量还很薄弱。这就是当时我们所面临的情况。显然不立即制止投机活动，坚决地把市场物价稳定下来，就无法安定人民生活，恢复和发展生产。针对这种情况，党适时地采取了坚决稳定物价的方针，首先将各种物价在当时的水平上稳定下来，然后在这个基础上，进一步作某些必要的调整，使之有利于发展生产和对资本主义工商业实行利用、限制、改造的要求。
    几年来执行这个方针的结果如何呢？
    （一）市场物价基本上是稳定的。一九五○年三月物价开始趋于稳定，接着，国家又要支援抗美援朝，又要拿出相当的力量投资于生产建设。在“边稳、边抗、边建”的情况下，市场物价始终保持着稳定的局面。特别是一九五二年以后，经济基本恢复了，土地改革完成了，朝鲜战争停止了，物价就确定地稳定下来。这是党在经济战线上的重大胜利，这个胜利为以后经济战线上一连串的胜利创造了必要的前提。
    （二）主要农产品的收购价格和相互间的比价基本上是适当的。在物价稳定了以后，国家合理地调整了粮食、棉花、烤烟、甘蔗等主要农产品的收购价格。这些农产品的商品量大约占农产品商品总量二百亿元左右的百分之七十，这些商品价格规定得适当，就有利于鼓励农民增加生产。
    （三）工农产品的差价缩小了。由于工业品销售价格的基本稳定和主要农产品收购价格的适当提高，几年来工农产品比价的差额是逐步缩小的。根据一九五五年二十四个省、区一百一十八个县城以下市场一百零七种产品的材料计算，工农产品比价的差额同一九五○年比较，缩小了百分之十七·二五。农民拿同样的农产品，可以换得较过去为多的工业品。这就是说，农民除了从土地改革和发展生产方面获得利益之外，除了摆脱了高利贷剥削和私商的少尺短秤掺假掺杂之外，从价格方面也获得了一定的利益，这是有利于工农联盟的巩固的。
    （四）配合了对资本主义工商业利用、限制、改造政策的实行。几年来，对资本主义工业，通过加工订货、统购包销，一方面使他们有合理利润可得，一方面又限制他们过多的不适当的利润；对资本主义商业，通过缩小地区差价和批零差价的办法，使批发商不能进行远地经营，大零售商不能过多地取得利润。这些措施有利于私营工商业的社会主义改造，是起了它的历史作用的。
    顺便说到，几年以来国家在主要农产品价格方面，为了反对囤积居奇和待价惜售，还采取了逐步缩小以至最后完全取消季节差价的措施，而且当时是在全年最高价格或者接近全年最高价格的基础上取消季节差价的，这就在实际上提高了这些农产品的收购价格，增加了农民的收入。而在销售方面，国家并没有因此提高农产品的销售价格。贮存这些农产品，本来有一定的损耗、费用、利息和利润，一定的季节差价是应当有的，但国家销售这些农产品也是全年一个价格。这就是国家经营粮食和若干农产品一般并不赚钱有的甚至赔钱的一个原因。
    总之，从上述执行的结果看，应当说党的物价政策是正确的，执行这个政策的结果基本上是成功的。
    二　目前价格方面的六个问题
    应当承认，解放初期的稳定物价是在当时现行价格的基础上稳定下来的，那时的物价并不完全合理，而在执行中间，许多时候我们偏重于稳定的一面，对于及时地合理调整的一面重视不够。同时，七年以来我国的经济情况、政治情况已经起了根本的变化，生产发展了，交通网扩大了，农业、手工业、资本主义工商业的社会主义改造基本上实现了，新的情况下面，若干原来合理的价格和各种差价，现在不能适应实际情况的要求了；加上，商业物价部门在规定价格、掌握制度等方面，工作上也有不少的缺点和错误，因此，价格方面存在的问题是很多的，各方面对此有意见也是很自然的。价格方面存在的问题大体上有以下几点：
    （一）总的物价水平是稳定的，但若干副食品的价格是上涨的。一九五三年开始，国家建设规模扩大了，城市发展了，就业人数增加了，人民购买力提高了，当时国营商业还没有大力经营副食品，因此蔬菜、肉类、油脂、豆腐等副食品出现了供应不足价格上涨的现象。一九五四年以来开始注意了这一方面的工作，采取了一些措施，但是副食品的供应情况一般还相当紧张，有的副食品按全年平均价格计算，还没有得到应有的稳定。
    （二）主要农产品的收购价格虽然是适当的，但一部分农产品的收购价格仍然偏低。桐油、茶油的收购价格，同粮食价格比较，仍然低于战前的水平；油菜籽的收购价格，虽然大体上相当于战前同粮食的比价，但是几年来粮食的单位面积产量提高了，棉花的单位面积产量提高得更多，而菜籽的单位面积产量除个别地区以外，不但没有提高反而低于战前，农民种菜籽不如种粮棉有利；猪的收购价格虽然已经高于战前同粮食比价的百分之十左右，但是农业合作化以后，养猪的条件已经发生了变化，过去农民养猪是可以“养猪不赚钱，回头看看田”的，现在农业社养猪必须核算成本，农业社社员养猪也要同参加集体劳动记工取酬的条件作比较，这样，原来的价格就显得低了；此外，部分地区的花生、芝麻、茶叶和蚕茧的收购价格也有偏低的情况。目前这些产品的产量许多没有达到战前的水平。养猪头数虽然比战前有所增加，但增加的速度还赶不上城乡人民需要的增长。这种情况同收购价格偏低，不能刺激生产积极性是有一定关系的。
    （三）国家经营农副产品一般并不赚钱，但有些商品在当地收购和当地销售之间差价偏大。比如不少地方，油料的收购价低，食油的销售价高，油饼甚至比油料还贵；不少地方，生猪收购价格同猪肉销售价格之间悬殊过大，农民用低价卖猪，高价买肉，他们很不满意。这是不合理的。这些差价的形成，有的是由于错误地按计价公式机械计算的结果；有的由于长途运输，远地加工，经营环节过多，费用过大；有的也由于税收偏高和某些商品商业利润偏大。
    （四）一些山区和偏僻地区，距离收购点远，交通十分不便，这些地区的农产品运输出来，国家是需要从运输费用方面有所补贴的。我们过去在这方面注意得不够，结果这些地区的农产品收购价格既低，农民收入很少，还要送到几十里以外，他们很有意见。
    （五）在品质差价方面，没有认真地执行优质优价的政策，没有采取鼓励新产品的政策，因此不能刺激工业品质量的提高，不能有效地鼓励工业品品种的增加，反而助长了品种的减少和质量的下降。过去有些容易买到的商品现在买不到了，过去有些质量很好的商品现在变坏了，这实际上是对消费者的一种变相的涨价。另外，在农产品收购方面，品质标准和等级差价也有规定得不适当的地方，特别是农民对我们某些收购机关的压级压价现象很有意见。
    （六）在地区差价方面，有这样几个问题比较突出：一个是，过去有些地区如西南、西北由于交通条件和历史原因，农产品价格比较低，工业品价格比较高，地区差价较大；现在铁路修通了，条件改变了，这种过大的差价显得不合理了（近来已经不同程度地作了一些调整）。一个是，过去工业品的地区差价一般是以主要产地为中心起点计算的，主要产地的价格低，其他地区的价格高，现在有些地方，工业已经发展起来，他们的产品不仅能够满足当地的需要，而且可以满足合乎商品流转方向的其他地区的需要，比如西安的某些种类的纱布，已经能够满足西北各省的需要。在这种情况下，再继续保持过去以上海为起点计算的地区差价，就不合理了。再一个是，有些地方将农产品的收购价格，机械地从集散地的价格推算回去，扣减层层费用，求出产地的价格，使这些地方的农产品收购价格过低，并且脱离同粮食的合理比价。这是违背销地价格服从产地价格的。
    以上是目前物价方面存在的主要问题。总起来看，全国解放以来，我国农产品和工业品的价格，可以归结为这样三种情况：（一）主要商品的价格过去是适当的，现在看来还是适当的。（二）一部分商品的价格过去是适当的，现在不适当了。（三）少数商品的价格，过去就是不适当的，现在还没有调整。这些不适当的或者已经不适当了的价格，所以没有能够及时地发现和调整，一个重要的原因就是因为我国一般地没有来自其他方面的价格竞争，问题不容易暴露。当然情况变化，我们经验不足，听取各方面的呼声不够，也是原因之一。应该看到，社会主义商业已经几乎成为我国唯一的商业，物价政策在国营商业方面有着特殊重要的地位，价格规定得适当与否，就更加要直接地广泛地影响到生产，影响到人民的消费和国家的积累。过去几年，我们没有认真地研究物价，总结经验，这种情况不能再继续下去了。
    三　调整物价的七项措施
    为了解决物价方面存在的问题，使我们的物价能够更好地适应客观情况，我们考虑，应当在稳定物价的基本方针下，根据有利于发展生产和商品流通，既照顾国家积累又照顾人民消费的原则，采取如下的措施：
    （一）较大幅度地提高生猪、油菜籽、桐油、茶油的收购价格，适当地提高芝麻、茶叶和部分地区的花生、蚕茧的收购价格。
    （二）当地收购当地销售的商品，购销差价过大的应当适当缩小；并且适当地分散粮食、油料、酿造、制粉的加工经营，恢复农村城镇的小型加工作坊，减少长途运输、远地加工，减少费用，并且还可以增加农村的饲料供应。
    （三）在交通十分不便的山区和边远地区，在那里收购需要外运的农副产品的时候，采取补贴运费的办法，即是对于运送里程较远的农民，另外从运费方面给予适当补贴。
    （四）适当提高小杂粮的收购价格。全国粮价一般不动。个别粮价略见偏低地区的粮食收购价格，可以逐步进行调整。
    （五）修正不适当的农产品品质标准和等级差价，纠正农产品收购当中压级压价的错误作法。国家规定的品质标准和等级差价，应当向群众广为公布；在验收定级的时候，应当采取群众路线的方法，组织有经验的农业社社员自己评级分等，然后由国家收购机关复核检验，协商决定。国家收购机关还可以规定一个验级的“公差”，允许在验级上有一定的差错率，以免收购人员常常怕负责任而发生压级压价的倾向。
    （六）切实贯彻执行按质论价、优质优价的政策，使生产好货的工厂，从价格上得到奖励，生产坏货的工厂从价格上得到鞭策。对新产品采取有效的奖励办法，使工厂因试制新产品而增加的成本能够得到补偿，设计人员和全体职工能够得到适当的鼓励。同时，商业部门在销售价格上也应当切实执行优质优价的政策，残损变质商品的降价处理，授权当地人民委员会批准执行。
    （七）适当地调整工业品的地区差价，使各地区间工业品的差价达到大体合理的水平。由于交通条件改变，某些地区差价过大需要调整的，可以适当降低这些地区的工业品价格，使之逐步达到合理；也可以考虑适当降低这些地区的工业品价格，同时适当提高一些其他地区的工业品价格，两面调整使之达到合理。由于生产情况改变，工业品地区差价已经显得过大的，只要当地产品已经能够满足当地需要，而且能够按照商品流转方向满足其他有关地区全部需要的，在质量相同的条件下，可以改变过去以老产区为起点计算价格的办法，逐步将这些地区的价格同老产区拉平。
    应当说到，关于农副产品方面的几项措施主要的目的是为了刺激农副产品的增产，特别是为了增加副食品的供应。这些农副产品的收购价格提高了，有些产品的销售价格是应当相应提高的。但考虑到有些产品和这些产品的制成品是人民日用生活必需品，为了不过多地影响广大人民的生活，销售价格目前还不宜变动。那么在这种情况下怎样办呢？第一尽量减少经营环节，减少商业费用，从改进工作当中想出路，这应当是社会主义企业的经常措施；第二国家可以考虑减低这些农产品的税率，减少国营商业经营这些农产品的利润，这是特殊情况下采取的临时性的办法。采取上述措施，其他经济作物会不会同粮食争地，因而减少粮食的产量呢？这是必须考虑到的问题。蚕茧和花生只在部分非集中产区提价不在全国提价，就是从这种考虑出发的；桐油、茶油和茶叶一般不存在同粮食争地的问题；对粮食影响最大的主要是油菜籽。我们估计，油菜籽提价以后，长江流域各省可能减少若干万亩麦田，增加若干万亩菜籽。但是历史上这些地区就是菜籽产区，抗战开始以来，菜籽的种植面积被小麦挤掉不少，而这些地区的小麦，质量差，出粉率低。同时，由于菜籽产量减少了，不得不使用很多大豆来榨油。并且由于这样，还引来另外一个不好的后果，这就是大豆榨了油，城乡市场上豆腐的供应减少了。大家知道，中国人没有青菜豆腐吃是个很大的问题。可以设想，如果能够增加十亿斤菜籽，这就使我们不仅有可能在一定程度上缓和食油供应的紧张，而且也使我们有可能顶替出二十多亿斤大豆，来适当满足全国人民对豆腐的需要。这样做，从各方面看都是有利的，至于因此而减少的小麦，则可以设法从提高北方各省小麦的单位面积产量来弥补。此外，粮食价格是所有农产品价格的主体，是市场物价的中心，粮价一有变动，必然牵动整个市场物价，因此，对于粮价的调整必须慎重从事；个别需要调整的地方，也只能分期分批地进行。
    四　其他问题
    调整价格的具体幅度和调整步骤，虽然还有待详细设计计算，请示中央决定；但总的说，农产品方面的几项措施，都是要国家多出钱，工业品方面的几项措施，许多是要国家少收钱，无论是提高收购价格或者降低销售价格，无论是降低税率或者减少商业利润，其结果都是要减少国家的财政收入。初步估算每年减少的数字大约在十亿到二十亿元之间。当然，这些价格的调整，可以大大地促进生产的发展，生产发展了也就有利于增加财政收入。但是事实上，发展生产和增加收入都需要有一个过程，而财政收入的减少则是立即就会出现的。例如，假使把每头猪的税收和利润减少三分之二，要从发展养猪来补足这笔减少的收入，就需要把养猪头数增加到三倍，即是从目前的一亿头增加到三亿头，这是要在粮食有很大增产以后才有可能，显然不是短期内能够实现的。
    财政收入减少了，财政支出也必须相应地减少，根据财政收支平衡的原则，除了增加生产厉行节约之外，别的出路是不多的。这就必然要在工业同农业、重工业同轻工业、国家建设同人民消费之间的比例上引来若干影响。国家提高农产品的收购价格，在这一方面的用的钱多了，农民的收入增加了，购买力提高了，除开供应生产资料，引导农民扩大生产之外，需要有更多的消费资料来供应农民提高了的消费需要，这样，也就不能不增加一些轻工业投资的比例，适当改变一些重工业投资的比例和其他方面支出的比例，在保证我国工业较高的发展速度的条件下，适应情况的变化，作一些必要的调整，这是应当的。我想，我们革命胜利了的国家，只要有一个允许我们和平建设的环境，应当根据需要和可能，把国家计划放在既积极而又稳妥可靠的基础之上。当然，国家工业化和优先发展重工业加强国防的方针，是代表着全国人民根本利益的方针。我们是一个经济上落后的国家，需要克勤克俭，努力建设；我们还受着帝国主义的威胁，我国的领土台湾还没有解放。不能因为过多地满足人民眼前的利益，而妨害人民长远的和根本的利益。如果那样做，终有一天人民是会回过头来埋怨我们的。这里所提的七项措施，只是根据具体的情况作有限度的调整，我想并不违背国家工业化和优先发展重工业加强国防的方针，而且从长远看，这样作还更加有利于这个方针的贯彻执行。我认为可以将上述调整的原则肯定下来，至于具体的调整幅度和调整步骤，则在考虑的时候应当全面地照顾到各个方面。界限是：既要照顾国家建设，又要照顾个人消费；既要提高人民的购买力，又要注意物资供应的平衡。任何片面强调都是错误的。不分轻重缓急，一下子要求搞到完全合理也是不现实的。
    为什么不采取每年降低工业品价格的方针
    这里，顺便说明这样的一些问题。近来不断接到各地干部和职工同志的来信，他们问，在我国为什么不采取每年普遍降低工业品价格的方针，而采取基本稳定工业品价格的方针？我想，首先这不是由于主观上想不想普遍降低工业品价格，而是由于客观上还不存在普遍降低工业品价格的条件。我们的轻工业品受着农业原料的限制，除了极少数产品以外，不是供过于求而是很感不足。在这种情况下，如果粗率地普遍降价，必然要发生严重的脱销，其结果不是被迫重新提价，便是人们买不到货出现黑市，或者是国家被迫扩大计划供应的范围。归根到底，降价还是一句空话。一九五三年我们曾经一度认为物资多了要降价出售，结果许多商品发生脱销，不得不又重新提价，这样的教训我们是有过的。同时应当说到，用降低工业品价格的办法扩大市场、刺激生产、改善人民生活，是一种方法，用增加职工工资和适当提高某些农副产品收购价格的办法也是一种方法。采用那一种方法，应当按具体情况办事。在我国目前的具体情况下，采用后一种方法还有一个更为有利的效果，这就是它能够更加直接地刺激劳动者的生产积极性，更加有利于按照国家的需要发展生产。我们这次所提的物价措施，主要的目的首先是为了发展生产，为了使价格更加合理，当然，这样作对于人民生活的改善也同样是有很大好处的。
    为什么有些商品不能采取薄利多销的办法
    有的同志问，为什么有些商品我们没有采取薄利多销的办法？这是因为商品的价格要看商品的具体条件。原料足、设备够、产量充分的商品，利薄一些多销一些是应当的，反之原料不足、设备一时难以扩大、产品并不能充分供应的商品，如果也实行薄利多销，其结果只能是“薄利脱销”。而且规定商品价格，还应当考虑不同商品对人民消费的重要程度和国家的积累。有些商品我们是少利甚至无利的；有些商品则国家可以多有一点积累。因此应当这样认识：单纯的营利观点是错误的；但不加区别不看条件笼统地要求薄利多销也是不对的。几年来我国人民的购买力提高了，商品的供应还能大体上适应市场的需要，工业品市场基本上没有黑市，除了个别供不应求的副食品以外，基本上没有抢购的现象，这就说明我们采取基本稳定工业品价格的方针，适当地考虑人民购买力同商品供应大体平衡的原则，来规定工业品价格的作法是可行的。这里附带说到，我们粮食棉花等统购的农产品，统购结束以后，农民还乐意按同一价格向国家出卖，农民在市场成交的部分，也同国家的统购统销价格相去不远，说明这种价格政策是容易为农民所接受的，也是可行的。
    以上所述总括起来，成绩四条，问题六条，提出的措施七条。这些仅仅是初步的意见。物价问题是一个非常复杂的问题，牵涉很广，必须慎重考虑。这些意见是否妥当，请各位代表指正。
