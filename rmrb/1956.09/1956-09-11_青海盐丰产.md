Xinhua News Agency dispatch: According to statistics from the Qinghai Provincial Salt Affairs Bureau: As of the end of August, the salt produced by the Chaka Salt Lake in Qinghai Province this year has exceeded three times the total output of the province in the past three years. In the next few years, Qinghai Province will reserve hundreds of thousands of tons of salt as raw materials for chemical factories.

Qinghai Province has extremely rich salt reserves, and the quality of the salt is very good. According to what is already known, there are more than sixty large and small salt lakes and salt flats distributed throughout the province. The Chaka, Keke, and Dab逊 salt lakes, known as the three major salt lakes of Qinghai, have reserves of more than 26.2 billion tons; among them, the Dab逊 Salt Lake covers an area of approximately 1,550 square kilometers and has reserves of approximately 25 billion tons.

Currently, the Salt Source Exploration Team of the Salt Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Food Industry and four other units are conducting exploration work on the Chaka and Keke salt lakes to collect data for the construction of a salt production plant equipped with modern technology in Qinghai Province.

    青海盐丰产
    据新华社讯　据青海省盐务管理局统计：到8月底为止，青海省茶卡盐池今年生产的盐，超过了过去三年来全省产量的三倍多。在今后几年中，青海省的盐将要储备数十万吨，作为化学工厂原料用。
    青海省的盐蕴藏量极为丰富，盐的质量很好。分布在全省各处的大小盐池、盐滩，据已经知道的，就有六十多处。号称为青海三大盐池的茶卡、柯柯和达布逊，蕴藏量即达二百六十二亿多吨；其中达布逊盐池，面积约有一千五百五十平方公里，储量约有二百五十亿吨。
    现在，食品工业部盐务总局盐源勘探队等四个单位，正在茶卡和柯柯两个盐池上进行勘探工作，为在青海省建设一个由现代技术装备的制盐厂收集资料。
