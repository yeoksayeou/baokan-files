Facts Are More Powerful Than Shouting

"A guerrilla force composed entirely of Europeans has been discovered in Algeria!" This was an eye-catching piece of news published in several Parisian evening newspapers on August 28th.

According to "France-Soir" and "Paris-Presse": the members of this guerrilla force are all residents of European descent, including those who speak Italian, Spanish, and French; they are fighting against the French army in the area of Pont-de-Rissell in western Algeria.

This news recalls an unseemly performance that took place at a meeting of the French National Assembly in early June. The meeting discussed the French government's policy on Algeria. When progressive member of parliament, Pierre Cot, mentioned in his speech that "France will one day have to recognize the Algerian nation," a burst of hysterical clamor immediately erupted from some seats on the right. According to Western news agencies, the speaker had a hard time calming down these gentlemen who were shouting like madmen.

Similar shouts have appeared not only in the parliament. The spokespersons of the French colonialist clique have been shouting all along that the Algerian nation simply does not exist. They attempted to use this method to put a better-looking coat on France's colonial rule and "dirty" war in Algeria.

According to these gentlemen, since there are eight million Muslims and more than one million people of European origin coexisting in Algeria, there is a very complex problem here. Therefore, the national self-determination and independence that have already been recognized in Morocco and Tunisia are not applicable here, and France must maintain its rule over Algeria. In this way, the Algerian people's armed resistance to colonial repression becomes "rebellion," while France's military actions are to "protect the interests of Europeans."

Indeed, there are about one million residents of European descent in Algeria, from France, Spain, Italy, and other countries. Among these people, apart from a very small number of colonialists who have become rich by plundering the local people, the vast majority are ordinary working people. They were forced to leave their homes by unemployment and hunger and have lived in Algeria for generations. Regarding these people, a historian once pointed out: "France has almost never recognized them. They do not consider themselves Spanish, Italian, or French, but only Algerian." In this way, an Algerian nation has gradually formed. This is a fact that no amount of shouting can deny. Therefore, Indian Prime Minister Nehru justly suggested in his plan to solve the Algerian problem that the French government should recognize the "Algerian national entity."

The news of the appearance of a European guerrilla force in Algeria is nothing less than a resounding slap in the face to the propagandists of the French colonialist clique. It turns out that the "Europeans" that these gentlemen were talking about are only that small handful of greedy colonialists. (Yuan)

### 事实比叫嚣更有力量

    事实比叫嚣更有力量
    “在阿尔及利亚发现了一支完全由欧洲人组成的游击队！”这是8月28日巴黎几家晚报上登载的一条引人注意的新闻。
    据“法兰西晚报”和“巴黎新闻”报道：这支游击队的成员全部是欧洲血统的居民，其中有说意大利语的、西班牙语的和法兰西语的；他们在阿尔及利亚西部彭—德—里塞尔一带同法国军队作战。
    这个新闻使人回想起法国国民议会6月初一次会议中所发生的一次不雅观的表演。这次会议讨论了法国政府对阿尔及利亚的政策。当进步的议员皮埃尔·戈特在发言中提到“法国有一天将不得不承认阿尔及利亚民族”的时候，右面的一些席位上马上发出了一阵歇斯底里的喧嚷。据西方通讯社报道，议长好不容易才使这些发疯一样狂叫着的绅士们平静下来。
    类似的叫嚣还不止出现在议会里。法国殖民主义集团的代言人们一直就在大吵大嚷说，阿尔及利亚民族是根本不存在的。他们企图用这个办法，给法国在阿尔及利亚的殖民统治和“肮脏”战争套上一件较为好看的外衣。
    据这些绅士们说来，由于阿尔及利亚有八百万穆斯林和一百多万原籍欧洲人同时存在着，这里有着一个极为复杂的问题。因此，在摩洛哥和突尼斯已经得到承认的民族自决和独立在这里是不适用的，法国必须保持它对阿尔及利亚的统治。这样，阿尔及利亚人民对殖民镇压的武装反抗就成了“叛乱”，而法国的军事行动则是为了“保护欧洲人的利益”。
    的确，在阿尔及利亚有着一百万左右欧洲血统的居民，分别来自法国、西班牙、意大利和其它国家。这些人中间，除了极少数是靠掠夺当地人民发财致富的殖民者以外，绝大部分是普通的劳动人民。他们被失业和饥饿逼得离开了家乡，在阿尔及利亚一代又一代地住了下来。对于这些人，有一位历史学家曾经指出：“法国几乎一直没有承认他们。他们也不认为自己是西班牙人、意大利人和法兰西人，而只认为是阿尔及利亚人。”就这样，一个阿尔及利亚民族逐渐形成起来。这是任何叫嚣都否定不了的事实。因此，印度总理尼赫鲁在他提出的解决阿尔及利亚问题的方案中公正地建议，法国政府应该承认“阿尔及利亚民族实体”。
    欧洲人组成的游击队在阿尔及利亚出现的消息，无异是打在法国殖民主义集团宣传家们脸上的一记响亮的耳光。原来，这些绅士所说的“欧洲人”就是他们那一小撮贪婪成性的殖民主义者而已。　（元）
