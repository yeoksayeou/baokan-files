Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 11th. The Hubei Daily published on the front page and in a prominent position, an important decision of the CCP Huanggang Prefectural Committee. This decision requires Party organizations at all levels in the Huanggang Prefecture to combine with the current work and conduct an education on the mass line and the promotion of democracy for all rural work cadres, criticizing the subjectivism and coercive command style that harm the work, in order to fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses of agricultural cooperative members.

This decision was made at a meeting of the CCP Huanggang Prefectural Committee. When the meeting analyzed the current rural situation in the prefecture, it pointed out: The vast majority of cadres in the Huanggang Prefecture have adhered to the working methods of the mass line in the face of the new situation after agricultural collectivization, paid attention to the democratic management of cooperatives, and powerfully promoted the high tide of agricultural production. 82% of the agricultural cooperatives in the entire prefecture have achieved bumper harvests. However, many cadres also have complacency, breeding subjectivism and a coercive command style. They one-sidedly believe that after rural collectivization, the awareness of the peasant masses has been raised and their strength has increased, so everything will be easy to handle. They rarely consider various new issues such as how to promote democracy and run the cooperatives well and promote technological reforms in production after collectivization. Therefore, in their work, they do not go deep into mobilizing the masses, do not conduct investigations and research, and only act based on subjective wishes, so that many good things have been turned into bad things; some have even applied the patriarchal leadership style formed in the long-term small-scale peasant economy to the leadership work of agricultural cooperatives.

At this meeting, the incident of Yuan Zhengquan, Secretary of the CCP Zhongyi District Committee of Macheng County, engaging in serious coercive command in his work, causing great losses in production, was exposed. Peng Shijian, member of the Party General Branch of Pengjiafan Township and Director of the Dongfanghong Agricultural Cooperative in this district, reported Yuan Zhengquan's mistakes to the inspection team of the Hubei Provincial Party Committee. Yuan harbored resentment and took the opportunity to remove Peng Shijian from the posts of Party General Branch member and cooperative director, arousing great dissatisfaction among the cooperative members. Incidents similar to Yuan Zhengquan's have also been found in other areas. This coercive command style, which is seriously divorced from the masses, has suppressed and frustrated the socialist enthusiasm of the broad masses of cooperative members to varying degrees, and is also one of the reasons for the failure of some cooperatives to increase production, as well as poor management and certain chaotic phenomena in the current autumn harvest distribution.

After analyzing, criticizing, and examining these serious situations, the CCP Huanggang Prefectural Committee decided to sum up and examine the current production, autumn harvest distribution, and deployment of grain requisitioning, purchasing, and sales work throughout the region. By adopting methods of commending good typical examples and criticizing bad typical examples, it will promote democracy, carry out criticism and self-criticism, and oppose subjectivism and coercive command styles among cadres. First, inspections and criticisms will be carried out at the expanded cadre meetings of the whole county being held in each county, and then gradually implemented from within the Party to outside the Party, and to the cooperative cadres. At the same time, in addition to instructing the Macheng County Committee to seriously investigate the "Yuan Zhengquan incident", the Prefectural Committee has also decided to launch a discussion on Yuan Zhengquan's coercive command and retaliatory attacks among rural cadres throughout the region. County newspapers in each county will also conduct more extensive and in-depth discussions on democratic cooperative management through typical events. Through these activities, the broad masses of rural cadres will better implement the working methods of the mass line and the principles of democratic cooperative management, give full play to the socialist enthusiasm of the broad masses of cooperative members, and ensure that the current production, autumn harvest distribution, and grain requisitioning, purchasing, and sales work are done well.

    中共黄冈地委会作出决定
    批判工作中的主观主义和命令主义
    新华社武汉11日电　湖北日报10日以头版头条的显著地位，刊载了中共黄冈地方委员会的一项重要决定，这个决定要求黄冈专区的各级党组织要结合当前工作，向全体农村工作干部进行一次群众路线和发扬民主的教育，批判危害工作的主观主义和强迫命令作风，以充分发挥广大农业社社员的积极性。
    这个决定是在中共黄冈地方委员会会议上作出的。会议在分析了这个专区当前农村情况的时候指出：黄冈专区的绝大部分干部在农业合作化后的新形势面前坚持了群众路线的工作方法，注意了民主管理合作社，有力地推动了农业生产的高潮，全专区82％的农业社都获得了丰收。但是，也有不少干部存在着骄傲自满情绪，滋长了主观主义和强迫命令作风。他们片面地认为：农村合作化后农民群众的觉悟提高了、力量大了，一切事情都好办了，对合作化后如何发扬民主办好合作社和推行生产技术改革等各种新问题却很少考虑。因而他们在工作中不深入发动群众，不调查研究，单凭主观愿望办事，以致把许多好事办成了坏事；甚至把在长期的小农经济生活中形成的家长式领导作风，运用到农业社的领导工作上来了。
    这次会议上揭发了中共麻城县中驿区区委书记袁正权在工作中发生严重的强迫命令，使生产遭受很大损失的事件。这个区彭家畈乡党总支委员、东方红农业社主任彭士简曾向湖北省委检查组反映了袁正权的错误以后，袁怀恨在心，竟借故撤换了彭士简党总支委员和社主任的职务，引起社员极大不满。类似袁正权的事件，在其他地区也发现不少。这种强迫命令、严重脱离群众的作风，不同程度地压抑和挫伤了广大社员的社会主义积极性，也是造成部分合作社不能增产，以及管理不善和当前秋收分配中出现某些混乱现象的原因之一。
    中共黄冈地委对这些严重情况进行了分析批判和检查后，决定在全区范围内通过总结检查当前生产、秋收分配和布置粮食征、购、销工作，采取表扬好典型、批评坏典型的办法，发扬民主，开展批评与自我批评，反对干部中的主观主义和强迫命令作风。首先在各县正在召开的全县扩大干部会议上开展检查、批判，再逐步从党内到党外，贯彻到合作社干部中去。同时，地委除已责成麻城县委认真检查“袁正权事件”外，并且决定在全区农村干部中展开对袁正权强迫命令、报复打击行为的讨论。各县的县报也将通过典型事件，更广泛深入地开展民主办社的讨论。通过这些活动，使广大农村干部更好地贯彻群众路线的工作方法和民主办社的原则，发挥广大社员的社会主义积极性，保证把当前生产、秋收分配和粮食征、购、销工作做好。
