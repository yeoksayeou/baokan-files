Dear Comrades and Friends!

Please allow me, on behalf of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, all its members, and the working people of the Mongolian People's Republic, to extend warm and heartfelt congratulations to the glorious Chinese Communist Party on its historically significant Eighth National Congress.

Comrades! The Chinese Communist Party, guided by Marxism-Leninism and successfully building socialism, is a great, glorious, and militant Marxist party.

The Chinese Communist Party has led the people to victory in the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolution, bravely overcome enormous difficulties, and successfully built its country and a happy new life. The militant activities of the Chinese Communist Party are an example of wholeheartedly serving the people.

Thanks to the wise leadership of the Communist Party, China has transformed from a semi-colonial and semi-feudal backward agricultural country into an industrial-agricultural country, smoothly building socialism, and advancing rapidly along the road of socialist transformation of industry and agriculture based on modern technology.

The great creative experience of the glorious Chinese Communist Party and the hardworking Chinese people in building socialism inspires the people of various people's democratic countries to build socialism and has a positive impact on the liberation movements of the people of Asia and the world.

This congress of the Chinese Communist Party is not only a major event of historical significance in the lives of the great Chinese people, but also in the lives of all progressive humanity, because the congress will map out new prospects for China's socialist construction.

Our Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party was born out of the Mongolian people's years of liberation struggle and under the direct influence of the great Russian October Socialist Revolution. It has grown and strengthened in the struggle to win the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolution and in the struggle for socialist construction.

The Mongolian people, advancing along the path pointed out by Marx and Lenin, under the leadership of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and with the selfless assistance of the fraternal Soviet people, have finally overcome long-term feudal backwardness in thirty-five years, consolidated the country's independence, and are now enthusiastically striving to build a socialist society.

The Mongolian People's Republic currently possesses a modern industry and transportation system that is developing under the people's democratic system. Mongolia's cultivation industry, like animal husbandry, is also developing on the basis of new technologies and scientific achievements. We now have our own working class and our own working intellectuals. Compared to 1940, the total industrial output value of the Mongolian People's Republic has increased 2.7 times, and the length of railways has increased fivefold.

Our national education, health care, science, and art are also constantly developing. There are no more illiterates among the adults in the country. Now, taking those over the age of seven, there are one hundred and forty people studying for every thousand people.

Our country is gradually carrying out the socialist transformation of the small commodity economy of the herdsmen. This year, the number of agricultural cooperatives has doubled compared to last year. Nineteen point two percent of the country's herdsmen have joined agricultural cooperatives.

Based on their personal experience, the working people of our country clearly know that the friendship and cooperation between our people and the people of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other countries of the socialist camp are the foundation of our happiness and prosperity.

The world-historically significant victory of the great Chinese people and the establishment of the People's Republic of China are of great significance to our country's further development. Now, in the struggle to build socialism, the Mongolian people constantly receive the selfless fraternal assistance of the Chinese people.

The government of the People's Republic of China has decided to give our people 160 million rubles to establish industrial enterprises and large cultural and living institutions. This is a huge economic and technical assistance to our country. An agreement on this issue was signed not long ago. This assistance from the fraternal Chinese people once again shows that the cooperation between the countries of the powerful socialist camp led by the Soviet Union is true fraternal cooperation, which is fundamentally different from the cooperation between capitalist countries.

The Mongolian people express their infinite gratitude and heartfelt congratulations to their sincere friend, the Chinese people, and firmly believe that the fraternal friendship between the Mongolian and Chinese peoples, as well as the two countries' cooperation in political, economic, and cultural fields, will surely develop and consolidate day by day.

Now, please allow me to read the congratulatory message from the Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party to the Eighth National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party.

Dear Comrades!

On behalf of all members of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and all the people of Mongolia, the Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party extends warm congratulations to the Eighth National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party and wishes the Congress great and brilliant achievements.

The Chinese Communist Party led the great Chinese people in a long period of liberation struggle, achieved a victory of world-historical significance, and established the great People's Republic of China.

Based on the specific conditions of the country, the Chinese Communist Party creatively developed Marxism-Leninism, encouraged and organized millions of hardworking Chinese workers and peasants to fight for the building of a socialist society, consolidated the worker-peasant alliance, and on this basis, in a short historical period, achieved great victories in national industrialization and the socialist transformation of agriculture.

The Chinese Communist Party and the Soviet Communist Party are marching hand in hand at the forefront of the struggle of the people of all countries for peace and freedom, actively safeguarding international peace and security.

The sincere fraternal friendship between our two peoples and the broad cooperation in political, economic, and cultural fields are being consolidated day by day.

The great achievements made by the Chinese people in socialist construction under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party are a powerful factor in the further development of the entire socialist camp led by the Soviet Union.

The Mongolian people once again express their sincere and heartfelt gratitude to the fraternal Chinese people for the comprehensive and selfless assistance they have given us in our struggle to build socialism.

The Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party sincerely hopes that the great Chinese people and the glorious Chinese Communist Party will continue to achieve new victories in the sacred struggle to further prosper the People's Republic of China, build a socialist society, and consolidate world peace.

Long live the glorious leader of the Chinese people, the Chinese Communist Party!

Long live the unbreakable friendship between the Mongolian and Chinese peoples!

May world peace be increasingly consolidated!

					The Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party
