Xinhua News Agency, August 31st: Britain and France are amassing troops in Cyprus, a British base less than 250 nautical miles from the Suez Canal, posing a threat to Egypt.

The first batch of French troops, numbering approximately 1,000, were airlifted to Cyprus and arrived on the 30th.

Agence France-Presse reports that the majority of the French Mediterranean fleet, concentrated in the port of Toulon, has now left port for an undisclosed location.

Agence France-Presse reports that the British Second Infantry Division, currently stationed in West Germany, has been ordered to move to Cyprus. Some of the division's equipment has already been loaded onto merchant ships docked in Hamburg. Part of the 16th Independent Parachute Brigade has arrived there.

In addition, Britain is reinforcing its troops on the island of Malta, another of its bases in the Mediterranean.

Xinhua News Agency, August 31st: "Paris Radical News" believes that the purpose of the military measures taken by Britain and France is: if Egyptian President Nasser insists on not accepting the "Dulles Plan" on the Suez issue, Britain and France will use these military measures as a means of exerting pressure.
