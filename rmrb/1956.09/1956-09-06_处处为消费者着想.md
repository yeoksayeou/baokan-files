    Always Thinking of the Consumer
    The "Xinhua" stencil paper produced by the Xinhua Stencil Paper Factory, a state-owned enterprise in Hangzhou, Zhejiang, is thin, durable, comes in a variety of grid patterns, and is inexpensive. It can be said to be "high quality and low price." This factory also helped us make a large stencil paper that is 44 centimeters wide and 81 centimeters long. This is a specially made stencil paper, four times the size of a regular stencil paper, and the quality is as good as "Xinhua" stencil paper, which provides us with a lot of convenience in our work. Recently, we also asked them to print grids on this large stencil paper. They also promptly replied to us, saying that after this production task is completed, they will manufacture this large stencil paper with grids for us.
    I believe that the Xinhua Stencil Paper Factory's service attitude and business style of thinking about consumers is worthy of learning by other factories throughout the country.

    处处为消费者着想
    浙江杭州地方国营新华腊纸厂出产的“新华”腊纸，又细又薄，坚固耐用，格子多种多样，价格也不贵，可以说是“价廉物美”。这个厂还帮助我们制做了一种宽四十四公分，长八十一公分的大腊纸。这是一种特制的腊纸，有一般腊纸四张那么大，质量和“新华”腊纸一样好，给我们工作上很多方便。最近，我们又要求他们把这种大腊纸上印上格子。他们也及时地给我们回了信，说是等这一期生产任务完成以后，就为我们制造这种有格子的大腊纸。
    我认为：新华腊纸厂这种为消费者着想的服务态度和经营作风，是值得各地其他厂子学习的。
