Xinhua News Agency, September 28th. The Indian Ambassador to China, R.K. Nehru, hosted a banquet this evening to welcome the Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Nepal, Tanka Prasad Acharya.

Premier Zhou Enlai attended tonight's banquet at the invitation of the Indian Ambassador.

Ambassador R.K. Nehru delivered a speech at the beginning of the banquet, welcoming the distinguished guests from Nepal. He said that they represent a country with ancient and friendly relations with India, a relationship built not only on contiguous land but also on common interests, shared ideas and culture, and a common spiritual heritage.

Ambassador Nehru mentioned the Nepalese King and Queen's visit to India a year ago and the Indian President's visit to Nepal next month when talking about the friendly exchanges between the two countries. He said, "Friendship and cooperation are necessary, especially between neighboring countries."

The Indian Ambassador wished the Nepalese Prime Minister a pleasant and successful visit. He said, "As friends and neighbors of Nepal, we hope to see the friendship between India, China, and Nepal grow day by day."

Nepalese Prime Minister Acharya delivered a speech in reply. He said that the Nepalese government and people fully believe in the great doctrine of Panchsheel. He believes that if all countries in the world maintain their relations with each other on the basis of the five principles of Panchsheel, international tensions and disputes between countries will no longer exist.

Prime Minister Acharya said that he is confident that the doctrine of Panchsheel will triumph in the near future and become a universal doctrine. Nepal is proud that its two great neighbors, India and China, are the joint initiators of this great doctrine.

Premier Zhou Enlai said in his speech at the banquet that China, India, and Nepal established relations more than a thousand years ago, or even earlier, and this relationship was initially based on Buddhist culture. The founder of Buddhism, Sakyamuni, was born in Nepal, Buddhism developed in India, and spread in China. This Buddhist culture connects our three countries. Not only that, but a phrase in Buddhism, Panchsheel, now connects our three countries again.

Premier Zhou said that as we celebrate the 2,500th anniversary of Sakyamuni's Nirvana this year, we feel the connection between Buddhist culture and Panchsheel even more as we welcome the Nepalese Prime Minister at the Indian Ambassador's banquet. Sakyamuni advocated peace, and our Panchsheel today is the five principles of peaceful coexistence. That is to say, we have developed Panchsheel on a new basis.

During the banquet, the guests repeatedly toasted to the friendship of the three countries.

Also attending the banquet tonight with the Nepalese Prime Minister were the Prime Minister's wife, the Nepalese Ambassador to China, Lieutenant General Rana, and other senior officials accompanying him, as well as the Chairman of the Nepalese People's Party, B. Mishra, who is also visiting China.

The Chinese side invited to the banquet included: Vice Premiers of the State Council Chen Yi, Ulanhu, Secretary-General Xi Zhongxun, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Zhang Bojun, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhang Hanfu, Chinese Ambassador to Nepal Pan Zili, President of the China-Nepal Friendship Association Zhou Jianren, and others.

Diplomatic envoys and diplomatic officials from various countries stationed in China were also invited to the banquet.

    印度驻华大使欢宴尼泊尔首相
    周恩来总理应邀出席了宴会
    新华社28日讯　印度驻中国大使拉·库·尼赫鲁今天晚间举行宴会，欢迎尼泊尔王国首相坦卡·普拉萨德·阿查里雅。
    周恩来总理应邀出席了今晚的宴会。
    拉·库·尼赫鲁大使在宴会开始时致词，对来自尼泊尔的贵宾表示欢迎。他说，他们代表着一个和印度有着古老而友好关系的国家，这种关系不仅由于土地接壤，而且是建筑在共同利益、共同的思想和文化，以及共同的精神遗产之上的。
    尼赫鲁大使在谈到两国友好交往时提到尼泊尔国王和王后一年前到印度的访问以及印度总统下月将要到尼泊尔的访问。他说：“友好和合作是必要的，尤其是在邻国之间。”
    这位印度大使祝尼泊尔首相的访问愉快和成功。他说：“我们作为尼泊尔的朋友和邻居，希望看到印度、中国和尼泊尔三国之间的友好与日俱增。”
    尼泊尔首相阿查里雅致词答谢。他说，尼泊尔政府和人民完全信仰潘查希拉的伟大学说。我认为假如世界上所有的国家在潘查希拉五项原则的基础上保持他们相互之间的关系，国际紧张局势和国家之间的纠纷将不再存在。
    阿查里雅首相说，我确信潘查希拉学说在不久将来将取得胜利，并且成为普遍的学说。尼泊尔感到自豪的是它的两个伟大的邻邦印度和中国，是这个伟大学说的联合创议者。
    周恩来总理在宴会上致词说，中、印、尼三国在一千多年前或者更早就建立了关系，这种关系首先建立在佛教文化的基础上。佛教创始人释迦牟尼出生在尼泊尔，佛教发展在印度，传布在中国。这种佛教文化把我们三国联系起来了。不但如此，佛教中的一句话潘查希拉现在又把我们三国联系起来了。
    周总理说，当今年释迦牟尼涅槃二千五百年时，我们在印度大使的宴会上欢迎尼泊尔首相，更感觉到佛教文化和潘查希拉的联系。释迦牟尼主张和平，我们今天的潘查希拉就是和平共处的五项原则，这就是说，我们在新的基础上把潘查希拉发展起来了。
    席间，宾主一再为三国的友好而干杯。
    今晚同尼泊尔首相一起出席宴会的有首相夫人、尼泊尔驻中国大使拉纳中将和随行的其他高级官员，以及同时来中国访问的尼泊尔人民党主席巴·米斯腊。
   中国方面应邀出席宴会的还有：国务院副总理陈毅、乌兰夫、秘书长习仲勋，中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会副主席章伯钧，外交部副部长章汉夫，中国驻尼泊尔大使潘自力，中尼友好协会会长周建人等。
    驻中国的各国外交使节和外交官员也应邀出席了宴会。
