Hoping for More Ancient Ironware to be Unearthed
—A Key Issue Regarding the Periodization of Ancient History
Guo Moruo

The primary key to the transition from slavery to feudalism lies in the pursuit of the development of productive forces. The improvement of productive forces renders the old relations of production unable to adapt, thereby breaking through the old relations and generating new ones.

What factors have improved productive forces and epochally enhanced them?

In ancient times, the emergence and use of iron is a crucial factor deserving special attention.

It is undisputed that iron was commonly used for agricultural tools during the Warring States period. Mencius wrote, "Cooking with pots and steamers, plowing with iron," indicating that "plowing with iron" was as commonplace as "cooking with pots and steamers" in Mencius' time. This further suggests that the practice of "plowing with iron" did not begin in the Warring States period but must have been much earlier.

During the Qin Dynasty, there were already iron officials. Sima Qian's ancestor, Sima Chang, once served as an iron official in Qin (see "Records of the Grand Historian, Preface by the Grand Historian"). Dong Zhongshu said that the "profits from salt and iron in Qin were twenty times greater than in ancient times" (see "Book of Han, Treatise on Food and Money"). In Dong Zhongshu's view, the Warring States period could not be considered "ancient," and even less so in the Qin Dynasty. According to Dong Zhongshu's statement, the establishment of officials to collect profits from salt and iron must have predated the Warring States period.

The "Record of Trades" ("Kao Gong Ji") is undoubtedly an official book from the State of Qi during the Spring and Autumn period (see my book "Heaven and Earth Xuanhuang," article "The Age and Nationality of the Record of Trades"). It mentions "Duan clan making 'bo' vessels," but unfortunately, the relevant text is missing. "Bo" vessels were agricultural implements, and the official name "Duan clan" (段氏) – Duan (段) is a simplification of "duan" (鍛), meaning "to forge" – indicates that the agricultural implements were made of iron, as iron needs to be forged. Using precious bronze for agricultural tools was a rare exception, used only in ceremonies.

The inscription on the "Marquis Qi Bell," a famous ancient artifact from the time of Duke Ling of Qi in the mid-Spring and Autumn period, mentions "creating 鐈 laborers four thousand." "鐈" should be the original or simplified form of the character for iron (鐵). This suggests that during the time of Duke Ling of Qi, there were indeed official laborers mining and smelting iron. (The relationship of this character 鐈 is crucial; I did not fully understand it before but have come to realize its significance in recent years.)

Therefore, Guan Zhong's "controlling the mountains and seas" (官山海) during his service to Duke Huan of Qi can be understood in a new light. "Guan" means to control, and "controlling the seas" naturally refers to controlling the salt industry, while "controlling the mountains" means controlling mineral resources, including copper and iron. The use of iron during the time of Duke Huan of Qi is, in my view, beyond doubt.

Therefore, in the "Discourses of the States, Discourses of Qi," when Guan Zhong says, "Fine metal is used to cast swords and spears, tested on dogs and horses; inferior metal is used to cast hoes, axes, and adzes, tested on soil," "fine metal" undoubtedly refers to bronze, and "inferior metal" refers to iron. Before iron could be forged into steel, its quality was inferior to bronze, hence the distinction between fine and inferior. Furthermore, the "Light and Heavy" chapters of the "Guanzi" mention that Qi had "iron officials." Although these chapters have been proven to be works from the time of Emperor Wen and Emperor Jing of the Han Dynasty, the authors could not have invented everything from scratch and must have had some basis.

Therefore, the material basis for Duke Huan of Qi's epoch-making achievement as the leader of the Five Hegemons, standing out among the feudal lords, can be found here. Boiling seawater to produce salt accumulated capital, and casting iron into agricultural tools increased agricultural production. Therefore, Duke Huan's hegemony was not solely due to the emergence of the exceptional statesman Guan Zhong but because this exceptional statesman identified the fundamental elements for national prosperity.

If Duke Huan of Qi was already using iron for agricultural tools, then the emergence of iron must have been even earlier. It takes a considerable period of groping and experimentation for a material with practical value to be effectively used, especially in ancient times. Therefore, the initial emergence of iron must have been long before the Spring and Autumn period.

The poem "Four Iron-Colored Horses, Very Sturdy" ("驷驖孔阜") in the "Airs of Qin" of the "Book of Odes" dates back to the time of Duke Xiang of Qin. This was during the early years of King Ping of Zhou, at the transition between the Western and Eastern Zhou dynasties. "Tie" (驖) is said to be named "Tie" because the horse's color was like iron. Some ancient texts directly use the character "iron" (鐵). This may be the earliest instance of the character "iron" appearing in reliable literature. (The "Tribute of Yu" mentions "fine iron and silver carvings," but that was a book from the Warring States period; the "Classic of Mountains and Seas" mentions iron, but that may be even later.)

It is difficult to trace further back in literature.

What does the archaeological evidence reveal?

In recent years (October 25, 1950 – January 8, 1951), the Chinese Academy of Sciences conducted excavations in Guweicun Village, Huixian County, Henan Province, and unearthed a large number of ironware from Tomb No. 1. The "Huixian Excavation Report" states: "Ironware was unearthed in two locations: one in the large tomb chamber outside the coffin, totaling forty-four pieces, mostly agricultural tools, likely left behind during the tomb construction; the other in the pit on the southern tomb passage, totaling twenty pieces of axes, chisels, knives, and gouges, and seventy-nine arrowheads, mostly tools and weapons, likely used by guards."

This batch of ironware has been identified as artifacts from over 2,200 years ago. "The smelting technology had reached a considerable level of advancement" ("Huixian Excavation Report," p. 83). Preliminary analysis has proven that the smelting method used at the time was the so-called early smelting method (i.e., solid-state reduction), and molds were used in the shaping process. "The use of molds is achieved on a considerable basis of development. Therefore, metal craftsmanship should have emerged even earlier." (Sun Tinglie, "Metallographic Examination of Several Ironware Unearthed in Huixian," "Archaeological Journal," 1956, No. 2.)

Another batch of noteworthy ironware consists of eighty-seven iron molds for various tools unearthed in Shouwangfen Village, Xinglong County, Rehe Province, on October 17, 1953. These include molds for hoes, double sickles, mattocks, axes, double chisels, and chariot parts (see Zheng Shaozong, "Warring States Production Tool Molds Discovered in Xinglong, Rehe," "Archaeological Communication," 1956, No. 1, and "Exhibition Catalog of Cultural Relics Unearthed in National Basic Construction Projects," plates 50-52). Many of these iron molds bear the characters "Right, You" (右酉). Following the example of "objects inscribed with the maker's name," "Right" likely refers to the Right Craftsman, and "You" likely refers to the name of the craftsman. The script is from the Warring States period. Subsequent investigations have proven that the excavation site was "a handicraft factory with a certain scale," and the iron molds were used to cast ironware (according to the aforementioned "Archaeological Communication").

Both of these batches of ironware belong to the Warring States period, and it can be said that they were very fortunate discoveries. We must understand that in ancient times, nobles disdained to use ironware as burial goods, and commoners could not bear to use them as burial goods. Therefore, finding ironware in ancient tombs is a rather difficult task. The two batches of ironware mentioned above were not burial goods, which is very noteworthy.

Since liberation, in addition to the two major batches mentioned above, quite a few scattered ironware from the Warring States period have been unearthed in Changsha, Zhengzhou, Shanxi, and Northeast China, but none have been found that can definitively prove to be from before the Warring States period. Does this mean that ironware was not used before the Warring States period? Based on the historical records and the two major batches of unearthed materials from Huixian and Xinglong, this claim can be firmly rejected! Forty years ago, Zhang Hongzhao's "A Study of the Evolution of the Bronze and Iron Ages in China" (see the appendix to Zhang's "Stone Elegance") determined that the transition between the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods was the "era of the initial use of ironware." I believe that archaeologists who still adhere to his statement are being too conservative.

Before liberation, there may have been opportunities to unearth ironware from before the Warring States period, but because antique dealers favored "auspicious bronze and jade," some decayed production tools were not valued and were therefore not preserved or recorded. Early ironware was poorly smelted and easily corroded and destroyed, making it difficult to preserve. Four or five years ago, I saw one or two fragments of copper weapons with iron in Beijing, said to be from the Yin Ruins. The artifacts somehow made their way to Japan, where Sueji Umehara used them to research and conclude that iron existed in the Yin Dynasty. (When I visited Japan at the end of last year, Mr. Umehara mentioned this to me in person, but the article has not yet been published.) However, without scientific excavation, this is not reliable.

I firmly believe that there are opportunities to unearth a large amount of ironware from before the Warring States period. Although ironware is easily corroded and production tools are often worn out and recast during use, ancient armories or agricultural tool warehouses (like the one in Huixian) and factory ruins (like the one in Xinglong) are likely to be discovered in further large-scale basic construction projects. I sincerely hope that such fortunate opportunities will occur more often, and I sincerely hope that comrades engaged in basic construction work and archaeological work in various places will pay special attention to the unearthing of ancient ironware. In particular, planned exploration and excavation of ancient iron smelting sites are worth considering in archaeological work.

If a large amount of ironware from before the Warring States period can be unearthed, it would provide more concrete evidence for a view on the periodization of ancient history, namely, that the transition between the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods marks the boundary between slavery and feudalism.

    希望有更多的古代铁器出土
    ——关于古代分期问题的一个关键
    郭沫若
    由奴隶制转变为封建制的主要关键当在生产力的发展上去追求。生产力提高了，使旧有的生产关系不能相适应，因而突破了旧有的关系而产生新的关系。
    是什么因素把生产力提高了，而且划时代地提高了呢？
    在古代，铁的出现和使用是值得特别重视的一个关键性的因素。
    战国时代，耕器已普遍用铁是不成问题的。孟子书中有“以釜甑爨，以铁耕”的话，可见“以铁耕”在孟子当时和“以釜甑爨”一样已成为常识；更可见“以铁耕”，其事不始于战国，必当更要早得多。
    秦代已经有铁官。司马迁的先人司马昌就曾经做过秦的铁官（见史记太史公自序）。董仲舒说秦“盐铁之利二十倍于古”（见汉书食货志），战国时代在董仲舒说来不能算是“古”，在秦代看来更不能算是“古”。根据董仲舒这句话，可见设官征收盐铁之利也必然要超越战国时代而更古些。
    考工记毫无疑问是春秋时代齐国的官书（参看拙著“天地玄黄”中“考工记的年代与国别”一文），那里有“段氏为鎛器”，可惜职文适缺。鎛器就是耕器，官名“段氏”，段即煅之省，可见耕器是以铁为原料的，因为铁须锻炼。以贵重的青铜作耕具是极少数的例外，是仅仅在典礼上使用的。
    春秋中叶齐灵公时有名的古器“齐侯钟”，铭文里面有“造?徒四千”的话。“?”应该就是铁字的初文或者省文。由此可见齐灵公时确已有采铁冶炼的官徒了。（这个?字的关系很重要，我以前没有认识清楚，近年来才体会到了。）
    因此，管仲相齐桓公“官山海”便可以得出新的意义。“官”者管也，“管海”自然是指管制盐业，“管山”就是把矿产管制起来，这里就包含着铜铁。齐桓公时已有铁的使用，我看是毫无疑问的。
    因此，国语齐语里面，管仲所说的“美金以铸剑戟，试诸狗马；恶金以铸锄夷斤?，试诸壤土”，美金是指青铜，恶金是指铁，也是毫无疑问的。铁在未能锻成钢之前，品质赶不上青铜，故有美恶之分。再者，管子轻重诸篇说到齐有“铁官”，轻重诸篇虽已证明是汉文景时的作品，但依托者不能凭空捏造，多少也是有些根据的。
    因此，齐桓公之所以能够划时代地成为五霸之首，在诸侯中特出一头地，在这儿可以找得出它的物质根据。煮海为盐积累了资金，铸铁为耕具提高了农业生产。所以桓公称霸并不是仅仅由于产生了一位特出的政治家管仲，而是由于这位特出的政治家找到了使国富强的基本要素。
    如果齐桓公既已使用铁作为耕具，则铁的出现必然更要早些。一种有使用价值的物质要真正被有效地使用，是要费相当长远的摩索过程的，特别是在古代。因此，铁的最初出现必然还远在春秋以前。
    诗经秦风有“驷驖孔阜”一诗，是秦襄公时候的诗。那是在周平王初年，即东西周之交。驖据说是马色如铁故名驖，古本也有径作“铁”的。这可能是铁字见于可靠文献的开始。（禹贡有“璆铁银镂”，但那是战国时代的书；山海经中有铁，那可能更后。）
    要在文献中再往上追溯就很困难了。
    从地下发掘的情形来看，又是怎样呢？
    近年（1950年10月25日—1951年1月8日）中国科学院在河南辉县固围村进行发掘，从第一号墓中出土了大量的铁器。“辉县发掘报告”上说：“铁器出土分二处，一处在棺椁外大墓室中，共四十四件，大都是农具，应为造墓时所遗留。一处在南墓道上住穴中，共斧凿刀削等二十件，箭镞等七十九件，大都是工具及兵器类，似为守吏用具。”
    这批铁器已被考定为二千二百余年前的古物。“冶炼技术，已有相当程度的进步”（“辉县发掘报告”83页）。后经初步化验，已证明当时的冶炼法是所谓早期冶炼法（即固体还原法），而在成型工艺上已使用模具，“模具的使用是在相当发展基础上获得的。因之金属工艺还应该出现得更早些。”（考古学报1956年第二期孙廷烈“辉县出土的几件铁器底金相学考察”）
    另一批值得注意的铁器是1953年10月17日热河兴隆县寿王坟村出土的八十七件各种工具的铁范。计有锄范、双镰范、镢范、斧范、双凿范、车具范等（参看“考古通讯”1956年第一期郑绍宗“热河兴隆发现的战国生产工具铸范”，又“全国基本建设工程中出土文物展览图录”图版50—52）。这些铁范多有“右酉”二字，准“物勒工名”之例，“右”当是右工师，“酉”当是工师之名。字体是战国时文字。后经调查证明，出土地是“一个具有一定规模的手工业工厂”，铁范是用来铸造铁器的（根据上注“考古通讯”）。
    这两批铁器都是属于战国时代，而且可以说都是很幸运的发现。铁器，我们要知道，古代贵族是不屑于拿来殉葬的，平民是舍不得拿来殉葬的。因此，从古代墓葬中找寻铁器是相当困难的事。上述的两批铁器都不是殉葬品，很值得注意。
    解放以来出土的战国时代铁器，除上述两大批外，长沙、郑州、山西、东北等地零星出土的也还不少，但可以确切证明是在战国以前的却还没有见到。是不是在战国以前还没有铁器使用呢？从文献上的资料和上举辉县兴隆两大批出土资料看来，是可以坚决地否定这种说法的！四十年前章鸿钊著“中国铜器铁器时代沿革考”（见章著“石雅”附录），断定春秋战国之交为“始用铁器时代”，考古学家至今还信奉着他的说法，我看是太保守了。
    战国以前的铁器，解放前可能已有过出土的机会，但因为骨董家们喜欢的是“吉金乐石”，一些腐烂的生产工具不曾被他们重视，因而没有被保存或纪录下来。初期铁器冶炼不精，容易锈蚀而归于消灭，也是不容易被保存下来的。四五年前我在京曾见有带铁的铜兵残件一二件，相传出自殷墟；其物不知何时流入日本，梅原末治据以研究，断论殷代已有铁。（去年年底访问日本时，梅原氏向我当面提及，文章尚未见。）但非经科学发掘，是不足凭信的。
    战国以前的铁器，我坚决相信，是可以有大量出土机会的。尽管铁器容易锈蚀，生产工具在使用过程中也多半被销磨改铸，但古代兵器库或农具仓库（如辉县那样）和工厂遗址（如兴隆那样），在更进一步的大规模的基本建设中，必然很幸运地还有发现的可能。我衷心期望着这样幸运的机会多多出现，我也衷心期望着各地从事基建工作的同志和从事考古工作的同志对于古代铁器的出土特别加以重视。尤其在考古工作方面，有计划地探寻并发掘古代冶铁遗址，是值得考虑的。
    战国以前的铁器如果能够大量出土，那就可以使古代史分期问题的一种看法，即以春秋战国之交为奴隶制和封建制的界限，获得更多的铁证了。
