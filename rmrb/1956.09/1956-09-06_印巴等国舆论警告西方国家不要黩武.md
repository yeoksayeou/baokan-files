    印巴等国舆论警告西方国家不要黩武
    据新华社新德里电　在新近成立的印埃友好协会的主持下，波保尔在9月2日晚上举行了一次群众大会。大会警告那些对埃及进行军事恫吓的西方国家说，如果西方在苏彝士问题上一心要侵略，那么它们将遭到严重的后果。
    大会向埃及人民保证说：“一旦在苏彝士问题上爆发战争，那么爱好和平的印度人民是会站在埃及人民这一边的。
    据新华社雅加达5日电　雅加达的报纸昨天抨击西方国家继续对埃及进行军事恫吓。
      “独立报”的社论指出，英国和法国以武力来威胁亚非国家的政策是过了时的政策。这家报纸说，埃及并不是孤立的，埃及的命运就是整个亚洲和非洲的命运。
    “东星报”斥责西方国家对埃及进行的军事恫吓和颠覆活动。呼吁世界人民起来防止因苏彝士运河问题的纠纷而引起的战争的危险。
      “永恒日报”也说，作为一个有高度自尊心的国家，埃及是不会接受在西方的枪口下提出的任何建议的。
    据新华社喀喇蚩5日电　“巴基斯坦时报”9月3日的社论抨击英法对埃及的军事恫吓说：“西方国家企图对埃及施加压力，这种行为造成了一种充满了可以想像得到的最严重的危险的局势。”“英国和法国正在急速地朝着战争边缘前进，这种战争不可能局限于苏彝士地区，甚至不可能局限于中近东。”
    这家报纸最后警告说：“今天这种疯狂行动只能是帝国主义在亚洲和非洲的残存地位毁灭的前奏。”
