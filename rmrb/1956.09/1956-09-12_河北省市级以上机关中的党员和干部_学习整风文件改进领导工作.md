Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 11th. Party organizations in Hebei Province's provincial, prefectural, and municipal-level organs are leading party members and cadres in these organs to study rectification documents and improve their leadership style.

The rectification study in Hebei's provincial-level organs began on August 25th. More than 10,000 party members and cadres from various provincial departments participated in the study. Before the start of the study, responsible cadres of party organizations in provincial-level departments, while conveying the spirit of the Provincial Party Congress, made ideological mobilizations to party members and cadres in light of the actual situation of their respective organs. This helped party members and cadres recognize the new situation and new tasks after Hebei Province completed the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce, as well as the problems arising from this new situation among party members and cadres in their work, thereby recognizing the importance of rectification study. Currently, most organs have studied two or three of the following documents: "Reform Our Study," "Rectify the Party's Style of Work," "Oppose Stereotyped Party Writing," "Resolution on Certain Questions in the History of Our Party," and "On the Historical Experience of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat." Under the leadership of the basic-level party branches in various organs, many party members and cadres are studying the documents while simultaneously exposing problems in leadership work in light of the actual situation of their respective organs.

Rectification studies for party members and cadres in special district and municipal-level organs have also begun recently.

    据新华社保定11日电　中共河北省省、地、市级机关的党组织，正在领导机关中的党员和干部学习整风文件，改进领导作风。
    河北省级机关的整风学习在上月25日开始。省级各部门的一万多名党员、干部全部参加了学习。开始学习前，省级各部门党组织的负责干部在传达省党代会的精神时，联系本机关的实际情况，分别向党员、干部作了思想动员，使党员、干部认识到河北省完成农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造后的新形势新任务，以及这一新形势下党员干部在工作中所产生的问题，从而认识到整风学习的重要意义。现在，大部机关已将“改造我们的学习”、“整顿党的作风”、“反对党八股”、“关于若干历史问题的决议”、“关于无产阶级专政的历史经验”五个文件学习了两个或三个。许多机关的党员、干部在各机关中共基层支部的领导下，边读文件，边联系本机关实际情况，暴露领导工作中的问题。
    专区、市级机关党员、干部的整风学习也在最近先后开始。
