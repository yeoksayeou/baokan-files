    The mastermind behind the Suez Canal seizure – the United States – after engaging in all sorts of covert maneuvers, has now finally stepped from behind the curtain to the front of the stage.
    At a press conference on September 13, Dulles demanded that Egypt reconsider accepting the so-called "Users' Association" plan orchestrated by the United States. Although the American propaganda machine has repeatedly disseminated information that if those Western countries supporting the "Dulles Plan" are unwilling to participate in the "Users' Association," the United States will abandon the plan, Dulles now openly says that if such a situation arises, the United States, Britain, and France will "go it alone." Dulles pretentiously stated that the United States does not want to provoke "war," but he also supported Britain and France in taking so-called "appropriate other actions" when Egypt does not allow them to seize the canal, which is actually supporting armed intervention by Britain and France.
    To relieve Britain, France, and Western European maritime nations of their concerns about potential shipping and economic losses in the event of the use of force, the United States has indicated that it can provide them with economic support to encourage them to persist in their provocative plans against Egypt. Dulles stated that not only are American ships prepared to detour around the Cape of Good Hope if the canal becomes impassable, but the United States will also provide loans to other relevant countries to enable their ships to detour around the Cape of Good Hope as well. At the same time, the United States has repeatedly stated that if the supply of Middle Eastern oil to Europe is cut off due to an attack on Egypt, the United States will ship oil from the Americas to Europe.
    In this way, Dulles is effectively saying to Britain and France: Go ahead and fight, with me here, you don't have to be afraid of anything. There is now no doubt whatsoever that the United States is the mastermind behind the Suez Canal seizure.
    The United States clearly knows that Egypt will not accept the "Dulles Plan" or the "Users' Association" under any circumstances, yet it is still actively encouraging Britain and France to use military intervention to implement these plans, which fully exposes the extreme viciousness of the American conspiracy. It can be seen that the United States' purpose is not to genuinely reach any agreement with the Egyptian government on resolving the Suez Canal issue, but to use armed intervention by Britain and France to overthrow the current Egyptian government, remove this thorn in its side that is hindering the United States from organizing a military aggression bloc in the Middle East, and at the same time suppress the rising tide of national liberation movements in the Middle East and Africa. The United States' sudden withdrawal of "aid" for the construction of the Aswan Dam in Egypt and its coercion of the Egyptian government to accept the "Dulles Plan," which infringes upon Egyptian sovereignty, are all aimed at this. Since the Suez Canal issue arose, the Western propaganda machine has been clamoring to create a "second Mossadegh incident" in Egypt, which is not accidental.
    The insidiousness and viciousness of the United States lie not only in its dealings with Egypt but also in its dealings with Britain, France, and other Western European countries. In the past year or two, Britain, France, and Western European countries have shown a tendency towards decentralization in their relations with the United States and have increasingly adopted independent policies, which has greatly troubled the United States. The United States is now instigating Britain and France to use the threat of force on the Suez Canal issue, even at the cost of providing loans and oil, obviously to take this opportunity to further weaken the strength of Britain and France, make them more economically dependent on the United States, and thus strengthen American manipulation and control over Western Europe. From this point of view, when the likes of Eden and Mollet are clamoring for military intervention in Egypt, it is precisely when Britain and France are facing an even more miserable fate as errand boys. This is exactly like the Chinese saying: "The praying mantis stalks the cicada, unaware of the oriole behind." If the British and French ruling groups do not wake up now, they will fall into the trap of the United States.
    The Egyptian "Republic Newspaper" incisively pointed out the role that the United States is playing in the entire Suez Canal situation – the leader of the so-called "free world" and the leader of provocation against small countries. No matter how cunning the United States is, its true colors have been fully exposed. The United States cannot escape its responsibility for all the consequences caused by the use of force by Britain and France.

    螳螂与黄雀
    劫夺苏彝士运河的主谋者——美国，在做尽了遮遮掩掩的姿态以后，现在终于从幕后站到了台前。
    杜勒斯在9月13日的记者招待会上，要求埃及重新考虑接受美国所策划的所谓“使用国协会”的计划。虽然美国宣传机器一再散布消息说，如果支持“杜勒斯计划”的那些西方国家不愿意参加“使用国协会”，美国就将放弃这个计划，但是杜勒斯现在公开说，如果产生这样的情况，美、英、法将“单独干”。杜勒斯装腔作势地说，美国并不是想挑起“战争”，但他又支持英、法在埃及不许它们劫夺运河的时候采取所谓“适当的其他行动”，这实际上就是支持英、法的武装干涉。
    为了解除英、法和西欧海运国家对于万一使用武力以后航运和经济方面可能受到损失的顾虑，美国表示它可以给它们以经济上的支持，以鼓励它们坚持对埃及的挑衅计划。杜勒斯表示，不仅美国船只准备在运河不能通航的情况下绕道好望角，而且美国还将贷款给其它有关国家，使它们的船只也绕道好望角。同时，美国方面一再表示，如果由于进攻埃及而断绝了中东石油向欧洲的输送，美国将从美洲运石油给欧洲。
    这样，杜勒斯实际上是在对英、法说：你们打吧，有我在这里，什么都不用怕。美国正是劫夺苏彝士运河的主谋者，现在已经没有丝毫可以怀疑的了。
    美国明明知道埃及在任何情况下都不可能接受“杜勒斯计划”或是“使用国协会”，却还是积极鼓励英、法用军事干涉去推行这些计划，这就充分暴露了美国的极端毒辣的阴谋。可以看出，美国的目的并不是真正想同埃及政府就解决苏彝士运河问题达成什么协议，而是要借助于英、法的武装干涉推翻现在的埃及政府，拔除这个妨碍美国在中东组织军事侵略集团的眼中钉，同时镇压中东和非洲人民日益高涨的民族解放运动。美国突然撤回对埃及修建阿斯旺水坝的“援助”，强迫埃及政府接受侵犯埃及主权的“杜勒斯计划”，其目的都在这里。自从苏彝士运河问题发生以来，西方宣传机器曾经叫嚷要在埃及制造“第二个摩萨台事件”，这并不是偶然的。
    美国的阴险毒辣还不仅在于它对埃及的一面，而且也在于它对英、法和西欧其它国家的一面。最近一两年来，英、法和西欧国家在同美国的关系上出现了离心的倾向，日益采取独立的政策，使美国大伤脑筋。美国现在在苏彝士运河问题上教唆英、法使用武力威胁，甚至不惜供给贷款和石油，显然是想乘此机会进一步削弱英、法的力量，使它们在经济上更加依赖美国，从而加强美国对西欧的操纵和控制。从这一点看来，艾登和摩勒之流对埃及大肆叫嚣武力干涉的时候，也正是英国和法国面临着更悲惨的小伙计的命运的时候。这正合了中国的一句俗语：“螳螂捕蝉，黄雀在后”。英、法统治集团现在再不醒悟，就要落进美国的圈套里去了。
    埃及的“共和国报”一针见血地指出了美国在整个苏彝士运河局势中所担任的角色——所谓“自由世界”的领袖和向小国进行挑衅的领袖。不论美国如何狡猾，它的真面目已经完全暴露。对于英、法使用武力所造成的一切后果，美国绝对逃脱不了它的责任。
