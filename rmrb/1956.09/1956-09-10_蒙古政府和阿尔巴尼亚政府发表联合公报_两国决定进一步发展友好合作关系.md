Xinhua News Agency, September 9th, Ulan Bator Dispatch: The government delegations of the Mongolian People's Republic and Albania issued a joint communiqué regarding the visit of the Albanian government delegation to Mongolia.

The Albanian government delegation, headed by Albanian Minister of Council Chairman Shehu and Albanian Labor Party Central Committee First Secretary Hoxha, paid a friendly visit to Mongolia from September 3rd to 7th. During the visit, Shehu, Hoxha, Mongolian Minister of Council Chairman Tsedenbal, and Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party Central Committee Secretary Dugersuren held talks.

The joint communiqué stated that during these close and friendly talks, issues related to the further development and consolidation of friendly and cooperative relations between Mongolia and Albania were discussed. Views were also exchanged on issues of mutual interest to the two countries and on certain international issues.

Both sides of the talks noted with great satisfaction that the fraternal, friendly cooperation between the Mongolian and Albanian peoples is expanding and developing year by year for the benefit of the peoples of both countries and the maintenance of world peace.

Both sides of the talks also discussed the further development of economic, cultural, scientific, and technological cooperation between the two countries, as well as the exchange of experiences gained in socialist construction, and signed an agreement on the exchange of goods and payments between Mongolia and Albania.

When exchanging views on international issues, both sides emphasized that the Mongolian and Albanian governments resolutely pursue a policy of developing peaceful and friendly relations between all countries based on the well-known Five Principles.

Both governments unanimously approved the effective measures taken by the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, the People's Democratic countries, the Republic of India, and other peace-loving countries to ease international tensions.

The Mongolian and Albanian governments believe it is unreasonable that Mongolia, a peace-loving, free, and independent nation that should enjoy the rights of a member state of the United Nations, has not yet been admitted as a member of the United Nations because the enemies of peace violate the lofty principles of the United Nations Charter and oppose and obstruct the demands of the majority of member states.

Both sides firmly believe that the United Nations should admit Mongolia as a member state at its next General Assembly.

The Mongolian and Albanian governments resolutely condemn the illegal act of not allowing one of the world's major powers, the People's Republic of China, to enter the United Nations, thereby diminishing the prestige of this important international organization.

    蒙古政府和阿尔巴尼亚政府发表联合公报
    两国决定进一步发展友好合作关系
    新华社9日讯　乌兰巴托消息：蒙古人民共和国政府和阿尔巴尼亚政府代表团就阿尔巴尼亚政府代表团访问蒙古发表联合公报。
    以阿尔巴尼亚部长会议主席谢胡和阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会第一书记霍查为首的阿尔巴尼亚政府代表团在9月3日到7日在蒙古作了友好访问。在访问期间，谢胡、霍查和蒙古部长会议主席泽登巴尔、蒙古人民革命党中央委员会书记杜格苏伦举行了会谈。
    联合公报说，在这次亲密友好的会谈中，商谈了有关进一步发展与巩固蒙阿之间的友好合作关系问题。并且也就有关两国利益和对某些国际问题的看法交换了意见。
    会谈双方十分满意地指出，蒙阿人民的兄弟友好合作，正为着两国人民的幸福和维护世界和平的利益而一年比一年地扩大和发展着。
    会谈双方还就进一步发展两国的经济、文化、科学技术合作及交换社会主义建设中所获得的经验等问题进行了商谈，并且签订了蒙阿之间换货及支付协定。
    就国际问题交换意见时，双方着重指出蒙阿政府坚决奉行在著名的五项原则的基础上来发展和平及各国之间的友好关系的政策。
    两国政府一致赞成苏联、中华人民共和国、各人民民主国家和印度共和国及其他爱好和平各国所努力采取的缓和国际紧张局势的有效措施。
    由于和平的敌人违反联合国宪章的崇高原则，反对和阻挠大多数会员国的要求，使应该享受联合国会员国权利的，爱好和平、自由、独立的蒙古一直到现在不被接纳为联合国会员国，蒙阿两国政府认为这是不合理的。
    双方坚决相信，联合国在它的下届大会上应该接纳蒙古为会员国。
    蒙古政府和阿尔巴尼亚政府坚决谴责不使世界大国之一——中华人民共和国进入联合国，因而减低了这个重要国际组织的威望的非法行为。
