Purchasers Demand Convenient and Reasonable Vegetable Purchases

The Beijing Vegetable Company has set up four large vegetable stations to centrally receive vegetables sent from the suburbs. The food units of Beijing's government offices, organizations, and troops are also designated to purchase at the vegetable stations. Recently, relevant authorities invited some purchasers to a forum, and they raised many opinions on vegetable management.

Purchasers have many opinions on the "unified purchase and sales" of vegetables, the centralized handling by vegetable stations, and the fixed-point allocation to wholesale units. A purchaser from a certain military unit said that they have to harness a cart early every morning and travel about thirty miles from Changxindian in the southern suburbs to the Malian Dao vegetable station (outside Guang'anmen) in the northern city to purchase vegetables, a journey that takes four hours each way. They enter the market at 2:00 PM every day and leave at 7:00 or 8:00 PM, not getting home until 11:00 PM. There is a vegetable production cooperative in their area, but they are not allowed to buy locally. They have to queue up every time they buy a type of vegetable at the vegetable station, which wastes a lot of time. Wang Decai from the Experimental Middle School said, "You have to queue up every time you buy a type of vegetable, and each time it takes at least half an hour." Liu Zhaoze from the Organization Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China said, "I enter the market at 2:00 or 3:00 PM every day, and often can't get back until 7:00 or 8:00 PM. I haven't been able to keep up with theoretical studies for several months." When the various vegetable stations distribute vegetables during the off-season, they divide them equally regardless of the size of the purchasing unit or the number of people eating. Comrade Yi Shengrong from the Air Defense Headquarters said, "Recently, the Malian Dao vegetable station distributed scallions, giving each unit one bundle regardless of the number of people in the dining hall."

In the forum, purchasers were most dissatisfied with the vegetable stations' practice of "selling old stock and storing new." Comrade Zhang Shutian from the Ministry of Education said, "One day, the Malian Dao vegetable station had some fresh eggplants, cucumbers, and zucchini in stock, but they sold us rotten vegetables. The vegetable station's sales staff urged everyone to buy rotten vegetables, often pointing to the rotten vegetables and saying to us, 'This is all the people's property!'" According to purchasers, the phenomenon of mixing rotten vegetables with the vegetables directly allocated to the canteens of government offices is also very serious. A purchaser from the Overseas Chinese School said, "In June, the Fuchengmen vegetable station allocated us a small cart of cabbage, totaling 1,600 jin, of which 500 jin were rotten and inedible. They also allocated 1,000 jin of potatoes, of which only 400 jin were edible, and the remaining 600 jin were rotten vegetables and dirt."

At the forum, purchasers also mentioned that vegetable prices were not reasonable enough. First, the difference between wholesale and retail prices was not well implemented. Comrade Liu Zichen from the Surveying and Mapping Institute said, "One day, the wholesale price of tomatoes at the vegetable station was two cents, while the retail price at the first and fifth joint sales groups of Xisi was seven cents, a difference of more than two times." Comrade Liao Yonglu from the Beijing Railway Administration said, "One day in early August, the Xin Si District Cooperative purchased onions from the Malian Dao vegetable station at 11 cents, and then resold them to us at a high price of more than 30 cents, making a profit of nearly two times." In addition, there was also a phenomenon of reversed and chaotic wholesale and retail prices. Comrade Yi Shengrong from the Air Defense Headquarters said, "In May, the Chinese cabbages sold by street vegetable carts (goods purchased from the Andingmenwai vegetable market) were only sold for 15.5 cents, while the vegetable station sold them for 16 cents. I don't understand how the company is controlling prices." Second, the quality of the vegetables was different, but the price was the same. Purchasers reported that the price of peeled cabbage hearts supplied to some government offices was the same as the price of unpeeled cabbage, so naturally everyone wanted the cheaper and better quality ones. Third, the price was the same for both retail and wholesale. Wang Decai from the Experimental Middle School said, "Buying whole crates from the vegetable station is priced at three cents, and buying retail where you can pick and choose is also priced at three cents. There is no doubt that everyone is willing to buy retail."

    采买员要求买菜方便合理
    北京市蔬菜公司设置了四个大菜站，集中接纳郊区送来的蔬菜。北京的机关、团体、驻军的伙食单位也被指定在菜站排队购买。最近有关机关曾约请一些采买员座谈，他们对蔬菜管理工作提了许多意见。
    采买员对于蔬菜实行“统购包销”，菜站集中吞吐，批菜单位实行定点划片供应有不少意见。某部队采买员说，他们每天一清早就要从南郊的长辛店套上大车去北城马连道菜站（在广安门外）批菜，单程约三十里，路行需四小时。每天从下午二时进菜场，七点到八点出场，晚上十一点钟才能到家。驻地本来就有蔬菜生产社，却不准就地购买。在菜站买一种菜，得排一次队，误时很长。实验中学王德才说：“买一种菜得排一次队，每次至少得半个小时。”中共中央组织部刘兆泽说：“我每天下午两三点钟进场，经常是在七、八点钟才能回去。已经有几个月不能坚持理论学习。”各个菜站在淡季分菜的时候，不论购菜单位大小，吃菜人数多少，一律均分。防空司令部义升荣同志说：“最近，马连道菜站分葱，不管你食堂人数多少，每个单位一律一捆。”
    在座谈中，采买员对于菜站采用“推陈储新”的分菜方法最为不满。教育部张书田同志说：“有一天，马连道菜站存着一些新鲜茄子、黄瓜、西葫芦，却把烂菜批给我们。菜站成交员动员大家买烂菜，常指着烂菜对我们说：“这都是人民的财产呀！”据采买员反映，菜站直拨给机关食堂的蔬菜中，夹烂菜一起拨去的现象也很严重。华侨学校采买员就说：“六月间，阜成门菜站给我们曾拨去一小车洋白菜，共一千六百斤，其中烂了根本不能吃的就有五百斤。另拨去土豆一千斤，其中能吃的仅四百斤，其余六百斤都是烂菜和泥土。”
    在座谈会上，采买员还谈到菜价有不够合理的地方。首先是批发和零售的差价幅度执行得不好。测绘学院刘子臣同志说：“一天，菜站的西红柿批发价是两分，西四联营第一、第五组零售七分，相差两倍多。”北京铁路管理局廖永禄同志说：“八月上旬的一天，新四区合作社从马连道菜站以一角一分批购的葱头，回去即以三角多的高价转卖给我们，看利将近两倍。”另外，批发零售价格也有颠倒混乱的现象。防空司令部义升荣同志说：“5月间，街上菜车出售的小白菜（从安定门外菜市场进的货）只售一角五分五，而菜站却卖一角六分，不明白公司到底是怎么掌握价格的。”其次，菜的质量不同，却是订的一个价。采买员反映：供应某些机关的剥了菜帮子的菜心价格，同不剥帮子的价格完全一样，自然谁都愿意要价廉物美的。再其次是零买整买也一个价。实验中学王德才说：“向菜站整筐的买，作价是三分，零买可挑选，菜站作价也是三分，毫无疑问，谁也愿意买零的。”
