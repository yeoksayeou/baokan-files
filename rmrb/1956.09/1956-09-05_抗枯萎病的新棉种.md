Xinhua News Agency: A new cotton variety with high resistance to Fusarium wilt has been successfully bred in Shehong County, Sichuan Province. After years of comparison and observation, as well as off-site testing and farmer trials, the results have been very good. The new variety also has the advantages of early maturity, long fiber, and high yield. It was successfully bred by the Shehong Cotton Fusarium Wilt Working Group, composed of the Sichuan Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences and the Jianyang Agricultural Experiment Station, and has been named anti-Fusarium wilt cotton seed "521128." According to the head of the group, Fusarium wilt in cotton has greatly developed in the cotton producing areas of Sichuan in recent years. This year, in Shehong County alone, more than 16,000 mu of cotton fields were affected, with a loss of more than 98,000 jin of ginned cotton. After the working group was established in 1952, it tested more than 50 disease-resistant varieties, all of which were unsuccessful. Subsequently, they focused on breeding from locally cultivated varieties, and after four years of repeated research, they selected this variety. The seeds collected from this new variety after the autumn harvest can reach 1,000 jin.

    抗枯萎病的新棉种
    据新华社讯　四川省射洪县选育成功一种具有高度抗枯萎病的棉花新品种。经过连年的评比观察以及异地测验和农民试验结果，效果都很好。新品种还具有成熟早、纤维长、产量高等优点。它由四川省农业科学研究所和简阳农业试验站组成的射洪棉枯萎病工作组选育成功的，已命名为抗枯萎病棉种“五二一一二八号”。据这个组的负责人说：近几年，棉枯萎病在四川棉产区有很大发展，今年仅射洪县一地受害棉田即达一万六千多亩，损失皮棉九万八千多斤。工作组在1952年成立后，曾试验抗病品种五十多种，都未成功。随后着重在当地栽培的品种中选育，经过四年来的反复研究，选育了这个品种。这个新品种秋收后收藏的种籽，即可达到一千斤。
