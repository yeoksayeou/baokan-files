Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 30th. In order to overcome bureaucracy and improve support for resource exploration in the Qaidam Basin, the Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party made a decision after the Provincial Party Congress, instructing Party member leaders of relevant units to go deep into the basin to understand the situation and specifically solve difficulties in the work. In late July, Chen Sigong, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, together with responsible Party member cadres from transportation, commerce, grain, post and telecommunications, banking and other units, went to the Qaidam Basin for inspection.
    During the inspection, Chen Sigong and others listened to reports from Party organizations in various units in the Qaidam Basin, held symposiums, and had individual conversations with many employees on the construction sites to listen to their opinions and requirements. Some problems that could be solved quickly were solved at that time, which greatly encouraged the workers who worked hard in the Qaidam Basin.
    On August 26, Chen Sigong reported back to the Standing Committee of the Provincial Party Committee after his inspection. In his report, he said that transportation and supply work in Qaidam has improved recently, but there are still many problems. The most important problem is that the construction of highways cannot keep up with the development needs of geological and petroleum exploration work. There are few social service institutions, commodity prices are high, the supply of vegetables and fresh meat is too small, and the delivery time of letters and newspapers is too long. The reasons for these problems, in addition to objective conditions, stem mainly from the fact that the Provincial Party Committee and provincial-level leading organs underestimated the rapid development of work in Qaidam and did not understand the situation well enough. For example, commercial, transportation, and postal and telecommunications departments did not establish necessary leadership institutions in the basin with the development of exploration work, which affected the impracticality of material consignment plans; some commodities were stockpiled, while others were out of stock, directly affecting the rational use of transportation capacity and the lives of employees. Commodity prices are not managed uniformly by an agency, and are generally high, without correctly grasping the state's principles for commodity prices in industrial and mining areas. At the same time, the failure of various units to equip necessary equipment and issue necessary equipment to dispatched employees when establishing institutions has also caused many difficulties in the work.
    Based on these circumstances, Chen Sigong put forward suggestions for improvement to the Provincial Party Committee. He said that in order to speed up highway construction, the strength of the labor force should first be increased, and it is currently urgent to mobilize more than 2,000 migrant workers from agricultural areas to provide support. Next year, eight new highways will need to be built in the basin, with a total length of approximately 1,730 kilometers, and the road surface quality of existing highways will continue to be improved. Additional automobiles should be allocated to the transportation company, and the Dachaidan automobile repair plant should be expanded; highway maintenance work should be strengthened; road maintenance teams should be gradually established to fix maintenance areas; and food and accommodation service facilities should be added along the main highway lines. In terms of improving the supply of employee necessities, farms in the basin should plant vegetables and raise livestock in a more planned manner. Vegetable production plans must consider transportation conditions and the balance of production and sales to prevent blindness. Reduce coarse grains and import large quantities of fine grains. All units must ensure that various cold-proof equipment are transported in before the end of September. Additional cars should be allocated to the construction company to solve the difficulty of short-distance transportation on construction sites, and efforts should be made to build more houses before winter. Chen Sigong also made suggestions on increasing institutions, adjusting prices, improving the working conditions of service institutions, and improving the lives of service personnel.
    When talking about his feelings about this trip, Chen Sigong said that contacting specific work in all aspects has provided a deeper understanding than before going down, which is indeed beneficial for overcoming bureaucracy.
    The Qinghai Provincial Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has submitted the current urgent and potentially solvable measures proposed by Chen Sigong to relevant departments for implementation, and is further studying the issues involving the overall plan for Qaidam.

    克服官僚主义，做好对地质勘探的支援工作
    中共青海省委领导人员到柴达木盆地视察
    新华社西宁30日电　中共青海省委员会为克服官僚主义，改进对柴达木盆地资源勘察工作的支援，曾在省党代表大会后作出决定，责成各有关单位的党员领导人员深入盆地了解情况，具体解决工作中的困难问题。7月下旬，中共省委书记陈思恭即偕同交通、商业、粮食、邮电、银行等单位的党员负责干部，前往柴达木盆地视察。
    陈思恭等在视察期间，曾听取了柴达木盆地各单位党组织的汇报，召开了座谈会，并且到工地上和许多职工作了个别交谈，听取他们的意见和要求。有些可以很快解决的问题在当时就解决了，大大鼓舞了在柴达木盆地辛勤劳动的职工。
    8月26日，陈思恭视察回来向省委常委会作了汇报。他在汇报中说，柴达木的运输和供应工作最近有些改进，但是还有不少问题，其中最主要的问题是公路的修建赶不上地质、石油勘探工作发展的需要，社会服务机构少，商品价格高，蔬菜、鲜肉供应太少，信件、报刊寄送时间太长等。发生这些问题的原因，除了客观条件以外，从省委和省级领导机关来检查，主要是对柴达木工作发展的迅速估计不足，情况了解不够。例如，商业、交通运输、邮电等部门没有随着勘探工作的发展，在盆地建立必要的领导机构，影响物资托运计划不够切合实际；有些商品积压，有些商品脱售，直接影响运输力量的合理使用和职工生活。商品价格没有一个机构来统一管理，一般偏高，没有正确掌握国家对于工矿区商品价格的原则。同时，各单位在建立机构时不配备必要的设备，派遣职工不发给必要的装备，也造成了工作中的很多困难。
    根据这些情况，陈思恭向省委提出了改进的意见。他说，为加快公路修建，首先应该增加民工力量，目前急须从农业区动员两千多名民工前往支援。明年还需要在盆地新建八条公路，全长约一千七百三十公里，并继续提高现有公路的路面质量。给运输公司再增拨一部分汽车，扩建大柴旦的汽车修理厂；加强公路养护工作；逐步设立道班房，以固定养护地区；公路干线沿途增设食宿服务机构。在改善职工生活品供应方面，盆地内农场要更加有计划地种植蔬菜和饲养食畜，蔬菜的生产计划必须考虑运输条件和产销平衡，防止盲目性。减少杂粮，大量运入细粮。各单位必须保证在9月底以前运进各种御寒装备。给建筑公司增拨汽车，解决建筑工地上短途运输的困难问题，争取在入冬前再多盖些房屋。陈思恭对增设机构、调整物价和改善服务机构的工作条件以及改善服务人员的生活等方面，也都提出了意见。
    陈思恭谈到这次下去的感想时说，接触到各方面的具体工作以后，比没有下去之前体会深刻了一步，这对克服官僚主义确实有好处。
    中共青海省委对陈思恭提出的当前急需并可能解决的措施，已提交有关部门实行，对涉及柴达木的全面规划的问题，正在进一步研究。
