Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps Transportation Unit
    Completes 630 Million Ton-Kilometers of Transport Tasks

    (By this newspaper) The Transportation Unit of the Xinjiang Military Region Production and Construction Corps had already overfulfilled its First Five-Year Plan by August 20th. In the three years and seven months, they completed a total of 630 million ton-kilometers of transport tasks, creating 1.088 billion yuan of wealth and contributing nearly 40 million yuan in net profits to the state.
    The Transportation Unit of the Production and Construction Corps is a powerful transportation force in Xinjiang, a region with vast areas and inconvenient transportation. In recent years, this transportation unit has transported a large amount of steel, cement, machinery, factory equipment and various other materials and daily necessities from inside the customs (关内), and the Sino-Soviet border, vigorously supporting Xinjiang's economic construction and improving the material and cultural life of the people of all ethnic groups. At the same time, it has also accumulated a large amount of funds for the Production and Construction Corps to develop water conservancy and farm construction.
    This transportation unit has also saved a large amount of fuel due to its emphasis on promoting advanced experiences. From last year to June this year, a total of 1,175.5 tons of gasoline were saved according to the prescribed fuel consumption. This year, in the "Safety, Savings, 100,000 Kilometers Without Major Overhaul" campaign, the experience of Su Changfu's safe and economical driving of 250,000 kilometers without major overhaul and An Guodong's experience in maintaining tires were promoted. In the first half of the year, the funds saved from tires alone could buy back 581 sets of domestically produced 900-20 tires.
    From August 20th to 25th, this transportation unit held a political work meeting to summarize the experience of completing the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, and adopted new measures to strive to better complete new transportation tasks. (Production Frontline News)

    新疆生产建设兵团运输部队
    完成了六亿三千多万吨公里运输任务
    本报讯　新疆军区生产建设兵团运输部队，到8月20日已经提前完成了第一个五年计划。他们在三年七个多月中，共完成了六亿三千多万吨公里运输任务，创造了十亿八千多万元的财富，上缴国家纯利润近四千万元。
    生产建设兵团运输部队在地区辽阔、交通不便的新疆是一支强大的运输力量。几年来，这支运输部队从关内、中苏边境运输了大批的钢材、水泥、机器、工厂设备等各种物资和生活用品，有力地支援了新疆的经济建设，改善了各族人民物质文化生活。同时也为生产建设兵团发展水利和农场建设积累了大笔资金。
    这支运输部队由于重视推广先进经验，几年来还节约了大量的油料。从去年到今年6月，按照规定的耗油量，共节省了汽油一千一百七十五吨半。今年在开展“安全、节约、十万公里无大修”运动中，推广了苏长福安全、节约行驶二十五万公里无大修的经验和安国栋保养轮胎的经验等，上半年光轮胎一项，节约的资金就可以买回900—20国产轮胎五百八十一套。
    这支运输部队在8月20日到25日，召开政治工作会议，总结提前完成五年计划的经验，并且采取新的措施争取更好地完成新的运输任务。　（生产战线报）
