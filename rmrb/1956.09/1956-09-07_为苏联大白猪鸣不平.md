    In Defense of the Soviet Large White Pig
    In 1950, China imported twenty-five Large White pigs from the Soviet Union. The Ministry of Agriculture decided to send them to the Tie嶺 Animal Husbandry Farm and the Chahar Pig Farm for breeding. Around August of that year, the weather was very hot. Most of the Large White pigs raised at the Tie嶺 and Chahar farms developed high fevers. Boars developed swollen testicles along with the high fever. After the fever subsided, the testicles atrophied, but they could still breed. Sows could still conceive after developing high fevers. Only a few sows produced some stillborn piglets, but most sows produced normal litters of twelve to thirteen healthy piglets. The Ministry of Agriculture's General Bureau of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine and the former Northeast Agricultural Department's Animal Husbandry Section concluded that it was "suspected brucellosis." However, when materials were sent to various places for culture and examination at that time, no bacteria were cultured. Subsequently, in August 1951, the phenomenon of stillbirths occurred again. Therefore, the Ministry of Agriculture's General Bureau of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine and the former Northeast Agricultural Department's Animal Husbandry Section further judged it to be "suspected brucellosis" and began to deal with the Large White pigs at Chahar and Tie嶺 with a method of mass slaughter. The Large White pigs at Chahar have all been killed. Only twenty-four Large White pigs at Tie嶺 were rescued from the butcher's knife by Zhang Kewei, the president of Shenyang Agricultural College, who argued with reason, and sent to the Dongling Experimental Farm of Shenyang Agricultural College for breeding. After nearly four years of breeding and observation, these twenty-odd rescued Large White pigs proved to have no "brucellosis." Their growth, development, and reproduction were all normal. To date, nearly a thousand have been bred, and they have been promoted in batches to Liaoning, Heilongjiang, Anhui, and other places. According to investigations, wherever management is good, their growth, development, and reproduction are also normal.
    The Large White pig is one of the excellent Soviet pig breeds, with a weight that can reach around 1,000 jin. Its characteristics are: strong physique, strong reproductive ability, able to eat coarse food, rapid growth, and strong disease resistance. This kind of pig is very suitable for raising in rural China.
    Since the Soviet Large White pig has these advantages and China lacks good pig breeds, why can't it be propagated on a large scale and promoted universally? The main reason is that the "suspected brucellosis" caused a disturbance. This disturbance has not yet subsided. It is said that the relevant departments of the Ministry of Agriculture are still depriving the Soviet Large White pig of its exhibition space at this year's National Agricultural Exhibition under the guise of "brucellosis." I think this is very unreasonable.

### 为苏联大白猪鸣不平

    为苏联大白猪鸣不平
    1950年我国由苏联输入了二十五头大白猪，农业部决定交送铁岭种畜场和察哈尔养猪场饲养。在当年8月前后，天气很炎热，铁岭、察哈尔两场饲养的大白猪中大部分都发高烧，公猪发高烧同时睾丸肿胀，高烧退后则睾丸萎缩，但仍能配种，母猪发高烧后也仍能受孕，只有少数母猪生产部分的死胎，大部分母猪生产正常，一胎生了十二到十三个很健康的小猪崽。农业部畜牧兽医总局及原东北农业部畜牧处便认为是“疑似流产菌症”。但当时把材料送到各处培养检查，并未培养出病菌来。接着1951年8月同样又发生产死胎现象。因此，农业部畜牧兽医总局及原东北农业部畜牧处便进而判以“疑似流产菌症”的罪名，开始以大屠杀方法处理了察哈尔和铁岭的大白猪。察哈尔的大白猪已被全部杀掉，铁岭的大白猪只有二十四头被沈阳农学院院长张克威据理从屠刀下争夺了出来，送到沈阳农学院东陵实验农场来饲养。这二十几头被解救出来的大白猪，经过将近四年的饲养观察结果，证明并没有“流产菌症”，生长、发育、繁殖等情况都很正常。到目前，已繁殖了近千头，并分批推广到辽宁、黑龙江和安徽等地。据调查，凡是饲养管理好的单位，它们的生长、发育、繁殖等情况也都很正常。
    大白猪是苏联优良猪种之一，体重能达到一千斤左右。它的特点是：体质强，繁殖力强，能吃粗食，生长迅速，抗病力强，这种猪很适合我国农村饲养。
    既然苏联大白猪有这些优点，我国又缺乏好的猪种，为什么不可以大量繁殖、普遍推广呢？主要原因是“疑似流产菌症”引起了风波。这个风波，至今仍未平息。据说农业部的有关部门还仍以“流产菌症”的罪名剥夺了苏联大白猪将在今年举行的全国农业展览会上的展览席位，我认为这是很不合理的。
