Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, 10th: Władysław Gomułka, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, said at the National Harvest Festival celebration held in Warsaw on September 9 that Poland's grain harvest this year is estimated to be as good as last year. Potatoes, which occupy a very important position in Polish agricultural production, are expected to have a much better harvest than last year.

In his speech, Ochab spoke about the main tasks currently facing rural Poland. He said that the first task is to systematically and rapidly develop overall agricultural production. Although agricultural production has increased compared to the pre-war period, it is still insufficient to meet the growing needs of the people. In 1955, the production of four major grains averaged 460 kilograms per person, while in 1938 it was 385 kilograms. From 1938 to 1955, meat production increased from an average of 28 kilograms per person to 47 kilograms.

Ochab said that we have not reached the agricultural production level stipulated in the Six-Year Plan. We still need to import more than one million tons of grain every year. If we work hard to systematically increase the yield per unit area, we will be fully capable of meeting our grain needs during the Five-Year Plan period.

He said that the second main task is to strengthen and further develop agricultural production cooperatives. More than 10,000 agricultural production cooperatives, with more than 200,000 farmers, are now cultivating nearly 2 million hectares of land. Last year, the yield per unit area of cooperative crops was 4% higher than that of individual farmers.

The third main task is to further deepen the process of democratization, more widely absorb the masses of farmers into local government agencies, expand the power of county and village people's congresses, and consolidate the people's legal system.

The fourth main task is to strengthen the worker-peasant alliance and strengthen the national united front of all Polish patriots based on the worker-peasant alliance. He said that People's Poland is a country of workers and peasants, a country building socialism. Without a fraternal and unbreakable worker-peasant alliance, we cannot overcome our difficulties and cannot build a socialist society.

In concluding his speech, Ochab expressed his firm belief that the National Harvest Festival will further strengthen the unity of the urban and rural working people who are working hard for the welfare of People's Poland.

    波兰今年谷物将得到好收成
    奥哈布提出目前农村主要任务
    新华社华沙10电　波兰统一工人党中央委员会第一书记奥哈布9月9日在华沙举行的庆祝全国收获节的大会上说，今年波兰的谷物估计可以得到和去年同样好的收成。在波兰农业生产中占有很重要地位的马铃薯预料比去年的收成要好得多。
    奥哈布在讲话中谈到了波兰农村目前的主要任务。他说，第一个任务就是系统地和更迅速地发展整个农业生产。虽然农业生产和战前相比已经增加了，但是还不足以满足人民日益增长的需要。1955年四种主要谷物的生产量平均每人是四百六十公斤，而1938年是三百八十五公斤。在1938年到1955年，肉类生产量从平均每人二十八公斤增加到了四十七公斤。
    奥哈布说，我们并没有达到六年计划规定的农业生产水平。我们每年还需要进口一百万吨以上的谷物。如果我们努力工作，使单位面积产量有系统的增加，我们将完全能够满足我们在五年计划期间的谷物需要。
    他说，第二项主要任务就是加强和进一步发展农业生产合作社。拥有二十多万农户的一万多个农业生产合作社现在耕种着近二百万公顷的土地。去年合作社农作物的单位面积产量比个体农民高4％。
    第三项主要任务是进一步深入地实现民主化的过程，更广泛地吸收农民群众参加当地的政府机构，扩大县和村的人民会议的权力，巩固人民的法制。
    第四项主要任务是加强工农联盟和加强以工农联盟为基础的一切波兰爱国者的全国阵线。他说，人民的波兰是一个工农的国家，是一个建设社会主义的国家。没有兄弟般的、牢不可破的工农联盟，我们就不可能克服我们的困难，就不可能建设一个社会主义的社会。
    奥哈布在结束讲话时表示，他深信全国收获节将进一步加强在为人民波兰的福利而埋头劳动的城乡劳动人民的团结。
