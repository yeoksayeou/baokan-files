Xinhua News Agency, London, September 15th: The British government's policy of military threats regarding the Suez Canal issue has already cost Britain well over 100 million pounds.

According to United Press International reporter Teller, this is the estimated cost of Britain's military preparations in the Mediterranean, the mobilization of emergency shipping, and the measures taken to deal with the impact of the Suez "crisis" on the stability of the pound. In addition, "it is understood that the British government will also have to make some arrangements to obtain oil from the Western Hemisphere to cope with emergencies, which will cost Britain its extremely scarce dollars."

Teller said that experts have warned the government that the Suez Canal issue will subject Britain's unstable finances to a new and severe test. Teller said that this year was originally a year in which the British government's expenses were prepared to be greatly reduced, but it is believed that the Suez issue has overturned this plan. There are indications that the British government will need to spend a lot of money in this regard in the future.

    对埃及实行军事威胁政策的结果
    英国不稳定的财政面临严重考验
    据新华社15日讯　伦敦消息：英国政府在苏彝士运河问题上所采取的军事威胁政策，已经使英国耗费了远远超过一亿英镑的费用。
    据合众社记者特勒报道，这是英国在地中海的军事准备、动员紧急航运以及为对付苏彝士“危机”对英镑稳定的影响而采取的措施的估计费用。此外，“据悉英国政府还将必须作出某些安排以便从西半球取得石油来应付紧急事件，这又将使英国花费它极其缺乏的美元”。
    特勒说，专家们已经警告政府，苏彝士运河问题将会使英国的不稳定的财政受到一场新的严重的考验。特勒说，今年本来是英国政府费用准备大大节省的一年，但是据信苏彝士问题已经推翻了这个计划。有迹象说明，英国政府在这方面今后还需要开支很多的经费。
