In the Karamay oil region, people enthusiastically discuss turbine drills. They also like to introduce the deeds of Soviet expert Mikhailov to guests with reverence and affection.

In mid-August, the reporter visited Mikhailov at the No. 107 exploration well site using turbine drills in Zhongguai, on the banks of the Manas River. He told the reporter about the superior performance of turbine drills. The normal speed of this turbine drill bit is 600 revolutions per minute. Its drilling efficiency is twice as high as the rotary drills currently used in our country. The widespread use of turbine drills is of great significance for accelerating the construction of oil fields in our country.

In June, the Karamay Drilling Department decided to use turbine drills at the No. 107 exploration well. However, turbine drills are much more complex than rotary drills, and drillers must have high technical skills to master them. But few of the drillers here are veterans, and most of the drilling engineers and technicians have only four or five years of experience.

On July 15, as soon as the turbine drill started, Mikhailov came to the well site. He taught the workers bit by bit everything from the disassembly, assembly, and repair of the turbine drill string to its operation. He worked alongside the workers, never leaving the drilling site, whether it was windy or raining. In order to help the workers learn the technology, he averaged only five hours of sleep a day for the first two weeks. Although his dormitory was only one or two hundred meters away from the drilling site, he was sometimes so tired that he fell asleep on the casing piles in front of the rig. Even then, he would tell the translator, "Wake me up when the drill reaches the bottom of the well at a certain time." Whenever the drill reached the bottom of the well, he would personally operate the start-up. Only after it was running normally would he hand the throttle to the workers.

Mikhailov not only taught the workers practical operations, but he also often gave lectures to the workers on the mechanical principles of turbine drills. When lecturing, he was afraid that the workers would not understand, so he often used diagrams, real objects, and examples from daily life to explain. Once, when he explained the principle of mud driving the turbine to rotate, he gave six examples in a row, from the flight of airplanes to why the roofs of some houses in the Gobi Desert are blown off by strong winds. Therefore, the workers could understand the principles Mikhailov explained.

Mikhailov often told the workers that turbine drills rotate quickly, and prolonged drilling can wear out the drill bit. However, the workers were very enthusiastic when they first learned it. Once in late July, when the expert was not there, the workers drilled very vigorously. Carelessly, they wore out the turbine drill bit and it fell to the bottom of the well. Coincidentally, after the drill pipe was lifted, the well logging team dropped the well deviation instrument when measuring the well deviation.

How should the accident be handled? Mikhailov advocated retrieving it. Some people believed that the well was thousands of meters deep, and similar accidents had happened in other wells in the past. In most cases, they could not be retrieved, which would delay drilling and sometimes cause even greater accidents. It would be better to continue drilling and grind up the turbine drill bit and the well deviation instrument. Mikhailov resolutely opposed this view. He believed that the well deviation instrument was a valuable instrument, worth more than 3,000 yuan. China could not manufacture it itself, and it was all imported from abroad. It must not be easily destroyed. They should try to retrieve it. He guided the welders to make a retrieval tool - "a grab" - and operated the drilling rig himself to retrieve it. As a result, all the things that had fallen down were grabbed, and the well deviation instrument was not damaged at all.

The workers of the No. 107 drilling team were particularly moved by Mikhailov's emphasis on safety work. Deputy driller Zhang Zhongyi and diesel engine worker Du Shuwen told the reporter about some of these things. When workers are working on the well, they like to untie the safety return rope on the hoist tongs to make their work more efficient. Whenever Mikhailov saw this, he would always re-tie the return rope and repeatedly advise the workers not to do this. Another example is that the mud pump used for the turbine drill has a dangerous pressure that is too high. He often went to check and repair it himself, but he strictly forbade workers who were not involved in the repair to approach it. Breaking the cathead rope is the most dangerous thing. Once he found that four of the six strands of the cathead rope were broken. He severely criticized the drilling technician: "Comrade, you must be responsible for the workers. Do you think that if the cathead rope breaks, it won't kill the technician anyway?"

The people in the Karamay exploration area deeply love Mikhailov and care about his life. But he himself is exceptionally self-disciplined in his life. In hot weather of around 100 degrees Fahrenheit, he often stays up late at night writing summaries in his room. When the translator tries to arrange some things for him in his life, he will be criticized: "You are a translator, just complete the things within your responsibilities. What kind of life do you want to live in the Gobi Desert?"

Mikhailov's work has already yielded good results. In just over a month, the workers of the No. 107 exploration well have basically mastered the turbine drill. Karamay's second turbine drill is about to start drilling at the No. 106 exploration well.

    苏联专家米哈伊洛夫
    新华社记者　伊晓
    在克拉玛依油区的人们都那么起劲的谈论着涡轮钻。人们又都是喜欢以崇敬和亲切的口吻把苏联专家米哈伊洛夫的事迹介绍给客人们。
    记者在8月中旬的一天在玛纳斯河畔中拐，使用涡轮钻的一零七号探井工地，访问了米哈伊洛夫。他向记者讲述了涡轮钻的优越性能。这种涡轮钻的钻头正常转速每分钟是六百转。它的钻进效率比目前我国通用的转盘钻要高出两倍。广泛使用涡轮钻对于加速我国油田建设是有着重大的意义的。
    6月份，克拉玛依钻探处决定在一零七号探井使用涡轮钻。但是涡轮钻比转盘钻复杂的多，钻工必须有高度技术才能掌握。而这里的钻工却很少是老手，钻井员和技师也多不过四、五年工龄。
    7月15日，涡轮钻一开钻，米哈伊洛夫就来到了井上。他从涡轮钻具的拆、装、修理到操纵，一点点地教给工人，他和工人一起做，刮风、下雨，他都不离钻井。为了帮助工人学技术，在头两个星期里，他每天平均只睡五个小时觉。虽然他的宿舍离钻井不过一、二百公尺远，可是他有时候困极了，倒在井台前套管堆上便睡，就是这样，他还要告诉翻译：“几点几分，钻下到井底，要叫醒我。”每当钻下到井底，他都要亲自操纵起动，运转正常以后，他才把闸把给工人。
    米哈伊洛夫不仅教导工人实际操作，他还常常为工人上课讲涡轮钻的机械原理。讲课的时候唯恐工人不懂，他常常用画图，举出实物和日常生活的例子来说明。有一次他讲泥浆推动涡轮转的原理，就一连举出六个例子，从飞机的飞行一直讲到为什么戈壁滩上有的房盖会被大风掀掉。因此，工人们都能明白米哈伊洛夫所讲解的道理。
    米哈伊洛夫常告诉工人们：涡轮钻转速快，钻得久了会磨坏钻头。可是工人们刚学会，兴头很高，7月下旬有一次专家不在，工人钻的很得劲，一大意把涡轮钻头磨坏掉在井底了。凑巧，提上钻杆以后，测井队测井斜时，又把井斜仪给掉下去了。
    事故怎样处理呢？米哈伊洛夫主张捞。有的人就认为井深千数来公尺，过去在别的井发生过类似事故，十有八九都捞不上来，耽误了钻进，有时还造成更大的事故。不如继续下钻，把涡轮钻头和井斜仪磨碎。米哈伊洛夫坚决反对这种意见。他认为井斜仪是贵重仪器，价值三千多元，中国自己不能制造，都是从国外进口，绝不能轻易毁掉，能不能捞上来应该试一下。他指导着焊工作了个打捞工具——“一把抓”，并且自己操纵钻机来打捞。结果掉下去的东西都抓上来了，井斜仪一点儿也没坏。
    一零七钻井工人们对米哈伊洛夫重视安全工作这一点特别感动。副钻井员张忠义和柴油机工杜述文向记者谈了这样的一些事。工人在井上工作，为了干活利落，爱把吊钳上保证安全的回绳解掉，这只要被米哈伊洛夫看见，他总要把回绳重新拴好，并且多次劝说工人不要这样作。再如涡轮钻所用的泥浆泵压力过高很危险，他自己常去检查修理，可是他严禁与检修无关的工人接近它。断猫头绳是最危险的事情。有一次他查觉猫头绳的六股线断了四股，他严格地批评了钻井技师：“同志，要对工人负责，难道你认为猫头绳断了，反正打不死技师吗？”
    克拉玛依探区的人都深深地喜爱着米哈伊洛夫，关怀他的生活。但是他自己却在生活上异常地克己。当着华氏一百度左右的燥热天气，晚间他还经常在屋里写总结。翻译同志为他张罗一些生活上的事，就会受到他的批评：“你是翻译，完成你职责内的事就好了。在戈壁滩上，还要过什么样的生活呢？”
    米哈伊洛夫的劳动已经有了很好的收获。仅仅一个多月的光景，一零七探井的工人们就基本上掌握起了涡轮钻。克拉玛依的第二部涡轮钻也就要在一零六探井开钻了。
