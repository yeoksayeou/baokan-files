    In and Out of Parliament
    By Pan Fei, Our Correspondent in London
    Suez, Suez, this has become an exciting word in London. When the news of the Parliament's temporary session to discuss the canal issue came out, how many people placed their hopes on it, and how many were anxious about it!
    On the morning of September 12th, I arrived at the Houses of Parliament for the second time. The traces of war have not yet been erased from this tall building. As soon as you enter the gate, you see rows of scaffolding; it was damaged ten years ago and is now being repaired. Two days before, I had been here to apply for a press pass from a gentleman in charge of press interviews. My request was politely refused. He said that there are three thousand journalists in London, and the House of Commons only has thirty seats for foreign journalists. Since the hope of entering the meeting hall was only one percent, I had to give up my original plan. I should thank that gentleman! He allowed me to see the face of the British people outside Parliament and hear the voices of the British people.
    There were still five hours before the parliamentary session, but hundreds of people had already lined up in front of the Houses of Parliament. They came from all corners of Britain! From Portsmouth on the south coast to small towns in Scotland in the north. They were waiting to meet with their local members of parliament to convey the opinions of the voters on the Suez Canal issue.
    Perhaps not coincidentally! Jet planes, which rarely appeared in the skies over London on weekdays, were now flying in groups, almost close to the clock tower of the Houses of Parliament, roaring past. Hearing the heart-stirring roar from the air made one feel that war—that terrible specter—was spreading its wings and looking down on you.
    Each time the clock hand on the clock tower moved a notch, the line in front of the building lengthened. By 2:30 in the afternoon, the House of Commons session had begun. At this time, the voters' representatives were also being led into the corridors of Parliament in batches.
    The so-called parliamentary corridor is a vaulted circular hall and several felt paths radiating out from it. One of these felt paths leads directly to the House of Commons chamber. Once the representatives entered here, this ancient building became active. They lined up, collected cards, and filled in the names of the members of parliament they wanted to meet on the cards. The cards were delivered into the meeting hall by a person in a black tailcoat. The police maintaining order kept hissing, warning the representatives to remain silent.
    I saw a microcosm of British society in the corridor. Here, there were burly miners, devout Christian housewives, engineers and elementary school teachers, and war veterans who had suffered the pain of war. They brought the instructions of countless miners, countless housewives... "No War!"
    A representative from Liverpool told me that thirty people had come from their city. They came to London as representatives of the 30,000 employees of the Cammell Laird shipyard. This young and enthusiastic British friend took out a mimeographed appeal from his pocket. It was printed by the Liverpool Peace Organization, asking the people of Liverpool to raise travel expenses for the representatives. He said proudly: "Our travel expenses are collected by thousands upon thousands of people, some one shilling, some a few pennies!"
    The representatives waited anxiously. They were waiting for the parliamentarians to bring reassuring news, waiting to tell the parliamentarians the feelings of thousands upon thousands of people. But from the meeting hall, only notes were passed out, saying: "Please wait another hour," "Please wait another thirty minutes," "Please wait a little longer...". I learned afterwards that at that time, behind those tightly closed doors, a discussion vital to the lives of the British people was taking place. Eden put forward a plan to forcibly pass through the Suez Canal. Gaitskell advocated submitting the issue to the United Nations.
    At 4:10, the doors of the meeting hall suddenly opened, and the parliamentarians poured out. The main speeches were over. The members of parliament who had been requested to meet by the voters' representatives came to the parliamentary corridor. A railway worker from Scotland handed a resolution signed by many people to the Conservative member of parliament for the constituency. It read: "We don't want war under any circumstances!"
    Thanks to the help of Labour MP Mr. John Baird, after many twists and turns, he took me into the visitor's gallery of the meeting. From this upstairs location, you can overlook the entire meeting hall. Before this, the meeting hall was so crowded and tense. Now, it seemed empty and very relaxed. Dozens of parliamentarians sat on both sides, constantly debating, questioning, refuting, and mocking each other. Some also put their feet on the large table in front of the Speaker and closed their eyes to rest. Mr. John Baird told me that by 8 o'clock in the evening, the parliamentary debate would enter a new climax. But before this climax arrived, I hurriedly left the House of Commons in the twilight.
    It was already 8 o'clock in the evening. The dazzling neon lights shone brightly; cars sped through the narrow roads; jazz music was playing in the bars... everything was the same as usual. But London, the largest city in the world, was spending such an unusual night!
    The debate in the House of Commons continued. Another political center was formed on the banks of the Thames River, not far from the Houses of Parliament.
    At the edge of "Waterloo Bridge", several people in Scottish national costumes played bagpipes and drums. People moved here in twos and threes, gathering more and more. The procession formed. The rolled-up flags were unfurled. They read:
    "Negotiate for a year, better than fighting for a year!"
    "No war for the Suez Canal!"
    This march was organized by the British Peace Committee. More than 5,000 people participated, including 3,000 voters' representatives from all over Britain. An official of the Peace Committee told me: Organizing such a movement is very difficult. August and early September are the traditional vacation season in Britain; the decision to reconvene Parliament was made hastily only a few days ago. He emphasized: "If the scale of our movement is not too small this time, it is mainly due to the increasing political activism of the British people."
    "Peace" has become a common language, uniting people of different professions and different beliefs. But each of them has their own different wishes and different pride. In the procession, there was Mrs. Mayes, who had come from Edinburgh, more than 400 miles from London, to participate in the demonstration. Excessive excitement made this gray-haired woman look much younger than her actual age. She said: "I have lived for sixty years and experienced two wars. I can never let my two grandsons taste the pain of war again!" Union worker波波渥尔斯 repeatedly urged me: "When you write the report, never forget the role played by the Trades Union Congress on the Suez Canal issue!"
    The procession moved towards the city center. Where it passed, pedestrians stopped and residents waved from the windows. Eight hundred police officers—mounted, on foot, and driving motorcycles—followed the procession, guarding and patrolling the traffic diversions. The British Peace Committee organized a short rally in the British Museum Square, ending the demonstration. There, the moon replaced the lights, and a truck served as a makeshift stage. The excessive simplicity made people feel extraordinarily solemn.
    The day's activities ended. In these full twelve hours, I saw the opposition and combination, mutual dependence and struggle of various political forces in Britain. I repeatedly savored a sentence spoken by Pastor Thomas at the rally in the square, he said: "We don't want war, it is not a small group of people who decide the fate of Britain, but the broad British people!"

    在议会内外
    本报驻伦敦记者　潘非
    苏彝士，苏彝士，这在伦敦已经成为一个激动人心的字眼。当讨论运河问题的国会临时会议开会的消息传出以后，多少人对它寄予期待，多少人又为它焦虑不安呵！
    9月12日上午，我第二次来到议会大厦。战争的痕迹，还没有从这个高大的建筑物上抹去。一进大门，就看到一排排的脚手架；它在十年前遭到了破坏，现在正在修葺。两天以前，我曾经到过这里，向一位主管新闻采访的先生办理记者证。我的要求遭到了有礼貌的拒绝。他说在伦敦有三千名记者，下院留给外国记者的席位，只有三十个。既然进入会议厅的希望只有百分之一，我就只好放弃原来的打算了。这倒应该谢谢那位先生！他使我在议会外面看到了英国人民的面貌，听到了英国人民的声音。
    距离议会开会的时间足足还有五个小时，但是，在议会大厦前面，已经有好几百人排成长长的行列。他们来自英国各个角落！南自海滨的朴茨茅斯，北自苏格兰的小市镇。他们等候着会见本地区的议员，向议员申述选民对苏彝士运河问题的意见。
    也许并非偶然！平日在伦敦上空很少出现的喷气式飞机，这时却成群地、几乎是紧挨着议会大厦的钟楼，呼啸而过。听到来自空中悸动心弦的轰鸣，使人感到战争——这个可怕的幽灵，正伸开双翼，俯视在你的头上。
    钟楼上时钟的指针每挪动一格，大厦前面的队伍，就延长一段。到了下午两点半，下院的会议开始了。这时，选民代表也被一批批地引进议会的走廊。
    所谓议会走廊，就是一个拱顶的圆厅，以及从它这儿幅射延伸出去的几条毡道。其中一条毡道，直通下院会议厅。代表们一进入这里，这个古老的建筑物就活跃起来了。他们排队，领取卡片，在卡片上填写要求会见的议员名字。卡片由一个穿着黑色燕尾服的人递送进会议厅去。维持秩序的警察，不断地发出嘘声，警告代表们保持肃静。
    我在走廊里看到了英国社会的缩影。在这儿，有体格魁梧的矿工，有笃信基督教的家庭妇女，有工程师和小学教员，有饱尝战争痛苦的退伍军人。他们带来了无数矿工、无数主妇……的嘱咐：“不要战争！”
    一位来自利物浦的代表告诉我，从他们那个城市一共来了三十人。他们是作为坎特莱造船厂三万职工的代表来到伦敦的。这位年轻热情的英国朋友，从口袋里掏出一张油印的呼吁书。这是利物浦和平组织印发的，要求利物浦人为代表们募集旅费。他用骄傲的口吻说：“我们的旅费是由成千成万的人凑起来的，有的一个先令，有的几个便士！”
    代表们在焦急地等待。他们等待着议员带来足以宽慰的消息，等待着向议员倾诉成千成万人的心情。但是从会议厅里，只是传出来一张张的字条，上面写着：“请再等一小时”，“请再等三十分”，“请再稍等……”。我在事后才知道，当时在那两扇紧闭的大门后面，正在进行一场对英国人民生命攸关的讨论。艾登提出了强行通过苏彝士运河的计划。盖次克尔主张把问题提交联合国。
    四点十分，会议厅的大门砰然打开，议员们蜂涌而出。主要的发言已经结束了。被选民代表要求会见的议员，来到了议会走廊。一个来自苏格兰的铁路员工，把一份有许多人签名的决议书，递给选区的保守党议员。那上面写着：“我们在任何情况下都不要战争！”
    谢谢工党议员约翰·拜德先生的帮助，在经过许多周折之后，他把我带进了会议的旁听席。从这个楼上，可以俯视整个会议厅。在这以前，这个会议厅是多么拥挤，多么紧张。现在，却显得空空荡荡，十分松散。几十个议员分坐两旁，不断地辩论、责问、反驳、相互嘲笑。也有人把脚翘在议长前面的大桌子上，闭目养神。约翰·拜德先生告诉我，到晚上八点钟，议会的辩论将进入又一个新的高潮。但是，在这个高潮到来以前，我在暮色苍茫中匆匆地离开了下院。
    已经是晚上八点钟了。五光十色的霓虹灯照耀得眼花缭乱；狭仄的马路上，汽车穿梭如飞；酒巴间里播送着爵士音乐……这一切都和平常一样。但是伦敦、这个世界上最大的都市，正在度过一个多么不平常的夜晚！
    下院的辩论在继续进行。就在离议会大厦不远的泰晤士河河畔，形成了另一个政治中心。
    “渥特桥”边，几个穿着苏格兰民族服装的人吹起“风笛”，打起大鼓。人们三三两两地向这里移动，愈聚愈多。队伍形成了。卷着的旗帜扬开了。那上面写着：
    “谈判一年，比打一年仗好！”
    “不为苏彝士运河进行战争！”
    这次游行，是由英国和平委员会组织的。参加的群众有五千多人，其中三千名是来自英国各地的选民代表。和平委员会的一位负责人告诉我：组织这样一次运动是十分不容易的。8月份和9月初，在英国是传统的休假季节；议会决定复会，又是在几天以前才匆促决定的。他强调说：“如果我们这次运动的规模不算太小，那主要是依靠英国人民日益增长的政治积极性。”
   “和平”成为共同的语言，把各种不同职业、不同信仰的人团结起来了。但是他们每一个人又都有着各自不同的愿望，不同的骄傲。在队伍中，有一位从远离伦敦四百多里的爱丁堡赶来参加示威的玛耶斯太太。过分的兴奋，使得这位头发斑白的妇女，显得比他的实际年龄年轻得多。她说：“我活了六十岁，经历过两次战争。我决不能再让两个孙儿去尝战争的痛苦！”工会工作者泼波渥尔斯再三叮咛我：“当你写报道的时候，决不要忘记职工大会在苏彝士运河问题上所起的作用！”
    游行队伍向市中心前进。在它经过的地方，行人停止了脚步，居民们从窗户里招手欢迎。八百名警察——骑马的、步行的、驾驶着摩托车的，在队伍的前后左右追随，在交通迥道上把守巡逻。英国和平委员会在大英博物馆广场上，组织了一次短暂的集会，结束了这次示威。在那儿，月亮代替了灯光，卡车权充作讲台。过分的简单，反而使人感到异常地庄严。
    一天的活动结束了。在这整整十二小时内，我看到了英国各种政治力量的对立和结合，相互的依赖和斗争。我再三地回味着汤姆斯牧师在广场集会上所讲的一句话，他说：“我们不要战争，决定英国命运的不是一小撮人，而是广大的英国人民！”
