    A Greatly Historically Significant Congress
    The Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China has closed. As Comrade Mao Zedong said in his opening speech, this congress should summarize the experiences since the Seventh Congress and determine the Party's basic policies in the current period, in order to "unite the whole Party, unite all possible forces at home and abroad, and strive to build a great socialist China." Now, the congress has successfully completed this glorious task. The congress heard the political report of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the Eighth National congress, the report on the revision of the Party Constitution, and the report on the proposal for the Second Five-Year Plan. It adopted the Constitution of the Communist Party of China, the resolution on the political report, and the proposal on the Second Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy. In addition, the congress elected the Eighth Central Committee of the Party.
    China is a large Eastern country with a large population, a vast territory, and complex conditions. In such a country, the Communist Party of China led the people to thoroughly complete the bourgeois democratic revolution in the past few years, and basically completed the socialist revolution. These two revolutions are of great world significance. The political report of the Central Committee made a systematic and comprehensive summary in this regard. The victory of the two revolutions in China is the victory of Marxism-Leninism, and the experience of these victories is a beneficial contribution to the international workers' movement and the liberation movement of oppressed nations.
    As the resolution of the congress on the political report stated, because the cause of socialist transformation has achieved a decisive victory, the main contradiction in our country is already the contradiction between the people's demand for the establishment of an advanced industrial country and the reality of a backward agricultural country. The central task of the Party and the people of the whole country at present is to transform our country from a backward agricultural country into an advanced industrial country as soon as possible. The political report of the Central Committee and the resolution of the congress on the political report pointed out in detail what policies should be adopted in economic and cultural construction and in domestic and foreign affairs in order to accomplish this arduous task.
    The Eighth Congress conducted a full and creative discussion on the current economic policy issues. The reports, speeches, and resolutions of the congress all pointed out that it is necessary to adhere to the policy of giving priority to the development of heavy industry, and it is necessary to concentrate efforts to expand the construction of the metallurgical industry, the machinery manufacturing industry, the electric-power industry, the coal industry, the petroleum industry, the chemical industry, and the building materials industry, and actively establish and develop the parts of our heavy industry that are currently lacking or weak but are most urgently needed. At the same time, it is necessary to actively develop light industry based on the possibility of raw materials, funds, and market needs. The congress analyzed the difficult conditions and superior conditions of agricultural development in our country, and pointed out the main ways and correct policies for achieving agricultural production increases in the future. The congress put forward the task of further developing the transportation industry and commerce, and in commercial work, it put forward the task of maintaining a certain range of free markets under the leadership of the state within a unified socialist market, and the task of gradually adjusting some unreasonable prices on the basis of continuing to stabilize prices. Regarding the issue of improving the quality of products and projects, the issue of strengthening new product design capabilities in heavy industry departments, the issue of the layout of industry and other economic undertakings, the issue of the relationship between planned parts and unplanned parts of products, the issue of the relationship between centralized operation and decentralized operation of enterprises, the issue of the correct proportion of accumulation and consumption in national income, and the issue of the active, steady, and reliable development speed of the national economy, the congress made in-depth discussions. The congress also gave due attention to the policies and tasks of further developing education, science, culture, and health. The resolution passed by the congress on the political report correctly stipulates a series of basic policies in the cause of socialist construction in the coming period. The implementation of these policies will greatly promote a new upsurge in China's socialist economic and cultural undertakings.
    The Party's various policies on socialist construction are specifically manifested in the proposal on the Second Five-Year Plan passed by the congress. The proposal on the Second Five-Year Plan requires that the total output value of industry and agriculture in our country increase by about 75% compared with the original 1957 level during the Second Five-Year Plan period, the total industrial output value (including handicraft output value) increase by about 100%, and the total agricultural output value increase by about 35%. In order to achieve these targets, and in order to enable industrial and agricultural production to have greater development during the period of the Third Five-Year Plan, it is necessary to carry out capital construction work on a larger scale during the Second Five-Year Plan period than during the First Five-Year Plan. The proposal stipulates that the amount of investment in capital construction during the Second Five-Year Plan will increase by about 100% compared with the First Five-Year Plan. The proposal also put forward corresponding targets for the development of transportation, commerce, education, science, culture, and health. In order to concentrate the use of funds in construction undertakings, the proposal stipulates that the proportion of economic and cultural expenditures in the state's financial expenditures should be increased to 60%-70%, while the proportion of national defense and administrative expenditures should be reduced to about 20%. The proposal requires the working people of the whole country to continue to strive to improve labor productivity, requiring an increase of about 50% in the industrial and construction sectors during the Second Five-Year Plan; and on the basis of production development and improved labor productivity, the average wages of workers and staff will increase by 25%-30%, and the total income of farmers will also have a roughly similar increase. It is clear that the proposal on the Second Five-Year Plan has put forward an inspiring great program for the people of the whole country. The current task of the Party and the people of the whole country is to strive to overfulfill the First Five-Year Plan, in order to prepare a better foundation for the implementation of the Second Five-Year Plan, and to widely, earnestly, and realistically discuss and study this proposal, in order to assist government organs in doing a good job in specifically drafting the Second Five-Year Plan.
    The Eighth Congress also discussed many major issues in the country's political life. The congress satisfactorily resolved in principle the relationship between the dictatorship of the proletariat and the united front, the tasks of the state in strengthening the legal system in the coming period and further implementing the policy of leniency in the work of suppressing counter-revolutionary remnants, the division of administrative powers between the central and local governments, and the unity between the Han nationality and ethnic minorities. The resolution of these issues undoubtedly has an extremely important significance for mobilizing all positive forces in the country to build socialism.
    The discussion of international relations issues at the congress will also have a far-reaching impact on China's future development. Comrade Mao Zedong's opening speech, Comrade Liu Shaoqi's political report and the congress's resolution on this report, the proposal on the Second Five-Year Plan and Comrade Zhou Enlai's report on this proposal, as well as the general program in the Constitution of the Communist Party of China passed by the congress, all powerfully point out that consolidating and strengthening China's unbreakable brotherly friendship with the great Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries is the foundation of China's foreign policy. In order to build socialism, we must continue to strive to learn from the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, and strengthen economic cooperation with the socialist camp countries. For all neighboring countries, for all Asian, African, and other countries that agree with the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, we will continue to make unremitting efforts to develop and establish friendly relations. The congress expressed its warm sympathy for Egypt's just struggle to safeguard national sovereignty and other anti-colonialist struggles. The congress guarantees unconditional support for the socialist movement of the working class in all countries and the peace and democracy movement of the people of all countries. Comrade Mao Zedong's opening speech and the congress's resolution on the political report both put forward the task of preventing and opposing great-power chauvinism, warning us that at no time should we adopt an attitude of arrogance and self-importance in international relations. This is of great significance for strengthening the unity between our country and various friendly countries and the people of all countries.
    The Party Constitution passed by the Eighth Congress and the discussion on Party life are important events in the history of our Party. The Party's new Constitution puts forward stricter requirements for Party members and Party organizations, while at the same time giving Party members and Party's lower-level organizations broader democratic rights. The Party Constitution, the resolutions of the congress, and the reports of Comrades Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping, all made thorough explanations on strengthening Marxist-Leninist ideological work, preventing and overcoming subjectivism, promoting the Party's mass line tradition, implementing the Party's democratic centralism, and consolidating the Party's unity. The congress strictly criticized the subjective tendencies within the Party and called on the whole Party to strengthen investigation and research into practical life. The congress demanded the development of lively Party life, and demanded that the leading organs of the Party at all levels be good at learning from the masses of the people outside the Party and the masses of Party members within the Party, be good at listening to and considering different opinions from the same level and lower levels, allow the minority to retain their different opinions under the condition of obeying the majority decision, and allow lower levels to request changes to decisions from higher levels in the process of implementing higher-level decisions according to actual circumstances. All of these are to ensure that there is genuine rather than formal democracy, and genuine rather than formal unity within the Party. The congress changed the delegates' congresses at all levels above the county level to a permanent system, which is also a major development in the Party's democratic life.
    The Eighth Congress elected a new Central Committee, including 97 members and 73 alternate members. Our Party now has 10.73 million members, leading various important tasks in a country with a population of 600 million. A stronger Central Committee than before is absolutely necessary.
    All these historically significant great achievements of the Party's Eighth Congress have caused jubilation not only in the entire Party but also among the people of the whole country. This is very natural, because all patriotic people can see the bright future of our motherland from the results of this congress, and see the prospect of our country transforming from a backward agricultural country into a prosperous and advanced socialist industrial country. Our Party has shown from beginning to end in this congress the determination to rely closely on the masses of the people. The masses of the people believe that our Party will not let them down. Representatives of various democratic parties and non-party democratic figures also participated in the congress. It is especially gratifying that representatives of the communist parties, workers' parties, labor parties, and people's revolutionary parties of more than fifty countries participated in our Party's congress, expressing their congratulations to the congress, and some other fraternal parties gave the congress written congratulations. The newspapers and periodicals of fraternal parties in various countries also showed full attention and support to our Party's congress. This fact shows the great power of proletarian internationalist unity, and gave our Party and the working people of our country great encouragement. Under the leadership of the Party Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, all comrades of the Party will humbly learn, work hard, strengthen unity with the people of the whole country, and strengthen unity with the proletariat and people of all countries. Our cause will surely be victorious.

    一次有伟大历史意义的大会
    中国共产党第八次全国代表大会闭幕了。如毛泽东同志的开幕词所说，这次大会应当总结从七次大会以来的经验，决定党在当前时期的基本政策，以便“团结全党，团结国内外一切可能团结的力量，为了建设一个伟大的社会主义的中国而奋斗”。现在，大会已经圆满地完成了这个光荣的任务。大会听取了中国共产党第七届中央委员会向第八次全国代表大会作的政治报告、关于修改党的章程的报告、关于第二个五年计划的建议的报告，通过了中国共产党的章程，通过了关于政治报告的决议，通过了关于发展国民经济的第二个五年计划的建议。此外，大会还选出了党的第八届中央委员会。
    中国是一个人多地广、情况复杂的东方大国。在这样一个国家内，中国共产党领导人民在过去几年中彻底地完成了资产阶级民主革命，又基本上完成了社会主义革命。这两次革命具有巨大的世界意义。中央委员会的政治报告，在这一方面做了系统的、全面的总结。中国两次革命的胜利，是马克思列宁主义的胜利，这些胜利的经验，对于国际工人运动和被压迫民族解放运动是有益的贡献。
    如大会关于政治报告的决议所说，由于社会主义改造事业已经取得了决定性的胜利，我们国内的主要矛盾，已经是人民对于建立先进的工业国的要求同落后的农业国的现实之间的矛盾。党和全国人民的当前的中心任务，就是使我国尽快地从落后的农业国变为先进的工业国。中央委员会的政治报告和大会关于政治报告的决议，详细地指明了为了完成这个艰巨的任务，应当在经济文化的建设中和内政外交的工作中采取一些什么样的政策。
    第八次大会对于当前的经济政策问题进行了充分的创造性的讨论。大会的报告、发言和决议都指出：必须坚持优先发展重工业的方针，必须集中力量扩大冶金工业、机器制造工业、电力工业、煤炭工业、石油工业、化学工业和建筑材料工业的建设，积极建立和发展我国重工业中目前还缺乏的或者薄弱的而又是最急需的部分。同时，又必须根据原料、资金的可能和市场的需要，积极发展轻工业。大会分析了我国农业发展的困难条件和优越条件，指出了今后实现农业增产的主要途径和正确方针。大会提出了进一步发展运输业和商业的任务，并且在商业工作中提出了在统一的社会主义市场内保持一定范围的国家领导下的自由市场的任务和在继续稳定物价的基础上逐步调整某些不合理的价格的任务。关于提高产品和工程的质量问题，在重工业部门中加强新产品设计力量的问题，工业和其他经济事业的布局问题，产品中列入计划部分和不列入计划部分的相互关系以及企业的集中经营和分散经营的相互关系问题，国民收入中积累部分和消费部分的正确比例问题，国民经济的既要积极、又要稳妥可靠的发展速度问题，大会都作了深刻的讨论。对于进一步发展教育、科学、文化、卫生事业的政策和任务，大会也给予了应有的注意。大会关于政治报告所通过的决议，正确地规定了今后时期社会主义建设事业中的一系列基本政策。贯彻地执行这些政策，必将大大地促进我国社会主义的经济文化事业的新高涨。
    党关于社会主义建设的各项政策，在大会所通过的关于第二个五年计划的建议中得到了具体的表现。关于第二个五年计划的建议要求我国工农业总产值在第二个五年内比原定的1957年水平增长75％左右，工业总产值（包括手工业产值）增长一倍左右，农业总产值增长35％左右。为了实现这些指标，为了使工农业生产在第三个五年计划时期能有更大的发展，第二个五年计划期间必须用比第一个五年计划更大的规模来进行基本建设工作。建议中规定第二个五年内的基本建设投资额比第一个五年计划增加一倍左右。建议对于运输业、商业、教育科学文化卫生事业的发展，也都提出了相应的指标。为了集中使用资金在建设事业方面，建议规定把国家财政支出中的经济文化支出的比重提高到60％—70％，而把国防和行政支出的比重降低到20％左右。建议要求全国劳动人民继续努力提高劳动生产率，在工业部门和建筑部门要求在第二个五年内各提高50％左右；而在生产发展和劳动生产率提高的基础上，工人和职员的平均工资将增加25％—30％，农民的全部收入也将有大致相近的增加。很明显，第二个五年计划的建议向全国人民提出了一个鼓舞人心的伟大纲领。党和全国人民的当前任务，就是努力争取超额完成第一个五年计划，以便为第二个五年计划的执行准备更好的基础，并且广泛地、认真地、实事求是地讨论和研究这个建议，以便协助政府机关做好具体地编制第二个五年计划草案的工作。
    第八次大会对于国家政治生活中的许多重大问题也进行了讨论。大会令人满意地从原则上解决了无产阶级专政和统一战线的相互关系问题，今后时期国家在加强法制方面的任务和在镇压反革命残余的工作中进一步实行宽大政策的问题，中央和地方的行政管理职权的划分问题，以及汉民族和少数民族的团结问题。这些问题的解决，对于动员全国一切积极力量建设社会主义的事业，无疑地具有极其重要的意义。
    大会对于国际关系问题的讨论，对于我国今后的发展也将产生远大的影响。毛泽东同志的开幕词，刘少奇同志的政治报告和大会关于这个报告的决议，关于第二个五年计划的建议和周恩来同志关于这个建议的报告，以及大会通过的中国共产党章程中的总纲，都有力地指出，巩固和加强我国同伟大的苏联和各人民民主国家的牢不可破的兄弟般的友谊，是我国外交政策的基础。为了建设社会主义，我们必须继续努力向苏联和各人民民主国家学习，并且加强同社会主义阵营各国的经济协作。对于一切邻国，对于一切赞成和平共处的五项原则的亚洲、非洲国家和其他国家，我们将继续坚持不懈地努力发展和建立友好关系。大会对于埃及维护民族主权的正义斗争和其他反殖民主义的斗争，表示了热烈的同情。大会保证对于各国工人阶级的社会主义运动和各国人民的和平民主运动给以无条件的支援。毛泽东同志的开幕词和大会关于政治报告的决议都提出了防止和反对大国主义的任务，告诫我们在国际关系上无论何时都不许可采取骄傲自大的态度。这对于加强我国同各个友好国家和各国人民的团结有重大的意义。
    第八次大会所通过的党的章程和关于党的生活的讨论，是我们党的历史上的重要事件。党的新的章程向党员和党的组织提出了更严格的要求，同时又给党员和党的下级组织以更广泛的民主权利。党的章程，大会的决议，刘少奇同志和邓小平同志的报告，都对加强马克思列宁主义的思想工作、防止和克服主观主义、发扬党的群众路线传统、贯彻党的民主集中制、巩固党的团结等问题作了透彻的说明。大会严格地批判了党内的主观主义倾向，号召全党加强对于实际生活的调查研究。大会要求发展生动活泼的党的生活，要求各级党的领导机关善于向党外的人民群众和党内的党员群众学习，善于听取和考虑同级的和下级的不同意见，允许少数人在服从多数决定的条件下保留自己的不同意见，允许下级在执行上级决定的过程中可以根据实际情况向上级请求改变决定。所有这些，都是为了保证党内有真正的而不是形式的民主，有真正的而不是形式的团结。大会把县以上各级代表大会改为常任制，这也是对于党的民主生活的重大发展。
    第八次大会选举了新的中央委员会，包括委员九十七人和候补委员七十三人。我们的党现在有一千零七十三万党员，领导着六亿人口的国家中的各种重要工作，一个比以前更强大的中央委员会是完全必要的。
    党的第八次大会的这一切有历史意义的巨大成就，不但在全党，而且在全国人民中引起了欢腾。这是很自然的，因为一切爱国的人民都可以从这次大会的结果看到我们祖国的光明灿烂的未来，看到我国由落后的农业国变为富强的先进的社会主义工业国的远景。我们党在这次大会中自始至终表现了密切依靠人民群众的决心，人民群众相信我们党将不会辜负他们的期望。各民主党派和无党派民主人士的代表人物也参加了大会。尤其令人感激的是五十几个国家的共产党、工人党、劳动党和人民革命党的代表参加了我们党的大会，表示了对大会的祝贺，还有另外一些兄弟党给了大会以书面的祝贺。各国兄弟党的报刊对于我们党的大会也表现了充分的注意和支持。这个事实，说明了无产阶级的国际主义团结的伟大力量，给了我们党和我国劳动人民以莫大的鼓舞。全党同志在以毛泽东同志为首的党中央领导之下，虚心学习，努力工作，加强同全国人民的团结，加强同各国无产阶级和各国人民的团结，我们的事业是一定会得到胜利的。
