Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 15th: Phnom Penh Dispatch: Prince Sihanouk has formed a new Cambodian cabinet. The new cabinet was approved by the Royal Council today.

The new cabinet has twelve members, consisting of six ministers and six secretaries of state. Three of the ministers are reappointments. The new cabinet members include nine members of the People's Socialist Community, one Democrat, and one member of the Independence Party.

The previous Khim Tit cabinet resigned on July 29th, and a new cabinet had not been formed since. The King of Cambodia had twice designated Prince Sihanouk to form a new cabinet.

While the formation of the new cabinet was delayed, various sectors of Cambodian society repeatedly requested Sihanouk to form a cabinet. According to the "Ta Shan Bao" newspaper, the Cambodian Committee for Supporting the Neutral Policy submitted a petition to the King, requesting the appointment of Prince Sihanouk as Prime Minister. The petition stated that this was because Prince Sihanouk pursued a policy of neutrality and peaceful coexistence in line with the wishes of the people.

    西哈努克亲王组成新阁
    新华社河内15日电　金边消息：西哈努克亲王已经组成了柬埔寨新内阁。新内阁已经在今天得到王国议会批准。
    新内阁有十二位阁员，由六位大臣和六位国务秘书组成。其中三位大臣是继任。新阁员中包括九位人民社会同盟盟员、一位民主党人和一位独立党人。
    前任钦·迪内阁是在7月29日辞职的，新内阁一直未能产生。柬埔寨国王曾经两次指定西哈努克亲王组织新内阁。
    在新内阁迟迟不能产生的时候，柬埔寨各界曾经一再要求西哈努克出来组阁。据“塔山报”报道，柬埔寨拥护中立政策委员会曾经给国王一份请愿书，要求任命西哈努克亲王为首相。请愿书中说，这是因为西哈努克亲王奉行符合于人民愿望的中立和和平共处的政策。
