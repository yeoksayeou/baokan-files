    Large Clothing Stores Should Do Custom Work

    As people's material living standards improve, they naturally pay more attention to clothing. Who wouldn't want to have a beautiful garment made with stylish designs and attractive colors? However, we now encounter a problem: if you buy a good piece of fabric and take it to a small tailor shop, they may not have the patterns and you're afraid it won't turn out well. Large clothing stores, on the other hand, refuse to do custom work with your own materials. You must choose from the limited number of fabrics on their shelves. Clothing stores like Lantiian, Zao Cun, and Jin Tai, which moved to Beijing from Shanghai, make very good styles, but you can't find fabrics with good colors there. Even more strangely, at Lantiian Clothing Store, I had shirts made with my own materials when I was in Shanghai last year. But after they moved to Beijing, they no longer accept custom work.

    Why can't large clothing stores do custom work like traditional Chinese tailors? (Zhang Jin)

### 大服装店应做自料活

    大服装店应做自料活
    人们的物质生活水平提高后，服装也自然讲究起来了，谁不喜欢做一件花色、式样都很漂亮的衣服呢？但是，我们现在却碰到这样一个问题：买一块好料子到小裁缝店里去做，没有图样，怕做不好；大服装店却拒不做自料活，必须是在它那寥寥无几的货架上勉强挑一块料子去做。像上海迁京的蓝天、造寸、金泰等服装店，做的式样虽然很好，但并不能在他们那里挑到花色很好的料子。更奇怪的是像蓝天服装店，我去年在上海时，还拿着自料在那里做过衬衣，迁京后，就不收自料活了。
    为什么大服装店都不能像中装裁缝一样地做自料活呢？（张瑾）
