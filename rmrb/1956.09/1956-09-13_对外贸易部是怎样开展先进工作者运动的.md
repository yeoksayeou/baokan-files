How the Ministry of Foreign Trade Carries Out the Advanced Worker Movement
Shi Ya, Ye Jixiu

    Our Ministry of Foreign Trade's directly affiliated organs, under the leadership of the Party Committee, have been carrying out the advanced worker movement since May of this year, and have achieved some successes and accumulated some experience over the past few months. We are now presenting these immature experiences for your reference.

    When the movement began, we encountered some ideological obstacles. Many comrades, and even some leading cadres of certain units, one-sidedly emphasized the characteristics of work in government offices, believing that "government offices are not like industrial and mining enterprises, there is no advanced experience to speak of"; "everything is ordinary, there are no advanced individuals." Obviously, these views have no factual basis. In state organs, there are also many advanced experiences and a large number of advanced individuals, and the advanced deeds of many of them are very prominent. For example, Wang Zhuangmu, an engineer at the China Silk Export Company, has consistently devoted himself to studying technology for several years. Addressing the main problems in export silk production, he continuously proposed improvement methods. In adjusting piecework wages and raw material quotas alone, he saved the state more than 3 million yuan. Moreover, under his suggestion, China's silk production adopted high-grade acidic dyes and improved dyeing methods, using yellow spun silk instead of white spun silk, which not only reduced costs but also improved quality, expanded sales, and increased the state's foreign exchange income by 360,000 US dollars. Wu Yufeng, a commodity clerk at the China Machinery Import Company, diligently studied his professional work, overcame numerous difficulties, and made outstanding achievements in commodity research and price comparison, saving the state nearly 400,000 yuan in expenses. Zhang Yancong, a typist in the ministry's Confidential Office, actively modified the type tray and improved operating methods. For several years, his typing speed has continuously improved, and he has consistently maintained a quality level of one error per 60,000 to 70,000 characters, far exceeding the national quality standard (2,000 to 1). It is not difficult to see that the claim that there is "no advanced experience" or "no advanced individuals" in government offices is completely inconsistent with reality.

    At the Advanced Worker Representative Conference held by the foreign trade system in May, 37 advanced experiences were exchanged and summarized according to the work nature and professional system of each representative. Based on these experiences, 33 proposals for improving work were put forward to all employees of the foreign trade department. After the conference, the central content and requirements of the advanced worker movement in the directly affiliated organs of the Ministry were to mobilize and organize all employees, under the leadership of advanced workers and advanced groups, to earnestly implement the 33 proposals, study and promote the 37 advanced experiences, and continue to summarize and promote new advanced experiences. They were called upon to actively conduct rationalization proposals targeting the key problems existing in various tasks, and were required to fight alongside all employees of the entire foreign trade department to achieve the three tasks of the Ministry: (1) Striving to complete the state's First Five-Year Plan's foreign trade commodity circulation plan six months ahead of schedule; (2) Continuously improving the management of foreign trade enterprises, practicing thrift in all aspects, and accumulating more funds for national construction; (3) Doing a good job in the long-term and comprehensive planning of foreign trade work, improving the quality of work in all aspects, and striving to reach the advanced scientific and technological level of modern international trade within twelve years.

    In which areas has the actual role of the movement been manifested in recent months?

    First, it can further concretize the Party's principle of praising good people and good deeds. At the meeting held in May, we provided spiritual and material commendations and rewards to all attending advanced individuals. This universal yet differentiated commendation and reward is a great encouragement to every advanced worker and all employees. It greatly stimulated the socialist enthusiasm and creativity of the workers, and improved their love and sense of responsibility for their jobs, thus creating a trend of "advanced leads the backward, the backward catches up with the advanced, and the advanced becomes even more advanced" throughout the entire organization. For example, the Tariff Section of the General Administration of Customs, which had long accumulated 1,200 tax bills, processed all the accumulated tax bills in just a few days under the influence of the movement. The small group in the Optical Instruments Department of the China Instrument Import Company, specializing in trade with capitalist countries, has become an advanced group in the company under the leadership of Wang Hanxiang, an advanced worker representative. A clerk in the ministry's affiliated medical clinic, who was originally promoted from a service worker, can now be responsible for pharmaceutical statistics work under the cultivation of Dr. Zhang, an advanced worker representative. Even more touching is that the comrades in the Financial Accounting Department of the China Transportation Machinery Import Company automatically and creatively established a set of "Deeds and Accidents Registration Cards," recording advanced deeds on the front and errors and accidents on the back, with each person creating a card and entrusting one person to keep them. How closely they care about their contribution to the motherland, and how vigilantly they prevent any errors and accidents, large or small! The masses reflected: "Criticism and punishment are indispensable, but praise and reward are even more essential." This is entirely reasonable.

    Second, it can enable the Party's principle of implementing the mass line to be further grasped by the leading personnel of each unit, so as to better ensure the combination of leadership and the masses. According to incomplete statistics from within two months after the launch of the movement, each unit has received 251 rationalization proposals. These proposals were put forward by the workers, targeting the problems existing in the implementation of initiatives, the promotion of experience, and the completion of tasks. In some units, approximately one-third or more of the suggestions have been adopted and implemented by administrative leaders at all levels. In the promotion of existing experience, China National Import and Export Corporation has now summarized seven new working experiences. At present, the administrative leaders of many units are required to propose topics to all employees based on the problems revealed in the democratic inspection in the second quarter, mobilize everyone to use their brains and think of ways around the topic, and actively provide rationalization proposals for improving work. All of this shows that the launch of the advanced worker movement has enabled leading cadres at all levels to be more closely connected with and rely on the masses, and to concentrate the wisdom of the masses more widely, which will inevitably better promote the continuous progress of the entire work.

    Third, it can improve the quality of work and improve the efficiency of work in government offices and enterprises. For example, the financial accounting departments of each general company have generally responded to the initiative of financial accounting work and continuously carried out the "Quarterly No-Error Movement." Many units have achieved the requirement of "no errors leaving the door" in the past three months. In realizing the experience and initiative of reporting statements two days ahead of schedule, some general companies encountered obstacles from the fact that the working level of some subordinate companies could not keep up with the requirements. Therefore, they sent cadres down to provide specific assistance to ensure the smooth implementation of advanced experience; among them, the Cereals and Oils Export Company is now four days ahead of the original schedule, and twenty-two days ahead of the latest report in the past. The work efficiency of filing official documents in the Archives Office of the Ministry's General Office has also greatly improved. Before the start of the movement, it took an average of two hours per person to file a volume, but now it only takes fifty minutes, and the highest individual only needs nineteen minutes, while still ensuring the original quality of filing.

    Fourth, it can also improve the operation and management of enterprises, and better guarantee the early completion and over-fulfillment of the state's foreign trade plan tasks. For example, the proposals on transportation work put forward at the representative meeting required each company to generally reduce the expenses of transportation and miscellaneous fees by 5% within this year, on the premise of ensuring the completion of the annual import and export cargo transportation tasks. From the current implementation situation, most companies are expected to achieve this requirement, among which the Foreign Trade Transportation Company can reduce by 9.8%, which can save the state 8 million yuan in freight expenses. China Food Export Company only adopted the rationalization proposals on reducing the loss rate of fruit exports and changing the commodity transportation route, and is expected to increase the state's income by 400,000 rubles and 110,000 yuan within this year. In realizing the initiatives, the China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Import and Export Corporation has improved the export transportation and business accounting work, and has recently increased the state's income by 160,000 yuan.

    It is also necessary to mention the issue of organizational leadership.

    In the directly affiliated organs of the Ministry, the organizational leadership of the movement made such a principle: "Under the unified leadership of the Party organization, the administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League are responsible for their respective tasks." This is significantly different from the situation in industrial and mining enterprises, where the work of the advanced producer movement is mainly led by the trade union organization. We believe that such different regulations are more suitable for the special circumstances of state organs, and are therefore appropriate.

    At the same time, the administrative and business tasks undertaken by our state organs are national in scope, and the initiatives to be realized, the experiences to be promoted, and the rationalization proposals to be handled by the advanced worker movement are mostly related to the entire business work. Therefore, it is necessary to closely rely on the strength of the administrative organization and administrative leadership in order to solve the practical problems in the movement in a timely and effective manner. Because of this, in the division of responsibilities among the administration, the trade union, and the Communist Youth League, it is necessary to particularly emphasize the responsibilities of administrative leaders at all levels. Not only must the main organizational work of the movement be handed over to administrative leaders at all levels, but it is also necessary to strengthen the professional guidance of the competent business units (such as the Ministry's various competent business bureaus) for the movement.

    对外贸易部是怎样开展先进工作者运动的
    施亚　叶际秀
    我们对外贸易部直属机关从今年5月份以来在机关党委领导下开展的先进工作者运动，几个月来已取得了一些成绩和经验。现在把我们这些不成熟的经验介绍出来，供大家参考。
    当运动开始的时候也曾经碰到一些思想障碍，就是许多同志甚至是某些单位的领导干部片面地强调机关工作的特点，认为“机关不比工矿企业，没啥先进经验”；“都是平平常常，没啥先进人物”。显然这些看法是没有什么事实根据的。在国家机关中同样有不少的先进经验，也同样有大批的先进人物，而且其中许多人的先进事迹很突出。如中国丝绸出口公司的工程师王庄穆，由于几年来一贯专心钻研技术，针对出口丝绸生产中的主要问题，不断提出改进办法，仅在调整工缴和原料定额等几个环节上，就为国家节约了三百多万元的资金，而且，在他的建议下，使我国丝绸生产采用高级酸性染料，改进染色方法，以黄厂丝代替白厂丝，不但降低了成本，而且提高了品质，扩大了销路，为国家增加了三十六万美金的外汇收入。中国机械进口公司的商品员吴玉峰，由于苦心钻研本职业务，克服了工作中的重重困难，结果在商品研究和比价工作上做出了出色的成绩，为国家节约了近四十万元的开支。本部机要处的打字员张岩聪，由于积极改装字盘，改进操作方法，几年来不但打字速度不断提高，而且长期保证了六、七万字只错一字的质量水平，大大超过全国质量标准（二千比一）。这就不难看到，所谓在机关里“没啥先进经验”“没有先进人物”的说法，是完全不符合实际的。
    对外贸易系统在5月间召开的那次先进工作者代表会议上，曾经按照各代表的工作性质和专业系统，分别交流和总结了三十七项先进经验，并在这些经验的基础上，向对外贸易部门的全体职工提出了三十三项改进工作的倡议。会议闭幕以后，本部直属机关先进工作者运动的中心内容和要求，就是动员和组织全体职工，在先进工作者和先进小组的带动下，认真地实现三十三项倡议，研究推广三十七项先进经验，继续总结和推广新的先进经验；号召他们针对各项工作中存在的关键问题，积极开展合理化建议，要求他们与整个对外贸易部门的全体职工一道，为实现本部的三项任务而斗争：（一）争取提前半年的时间完成国家第一个五年计划的对外贸易商品流转计划；（二）不断改善对外贸易企业的经营管理，从各方面厉行节约，为国家建设积累更多的资金；（三）做好对外贸易工作的长期全面规划，从各方面提高工作的质量，争取在十二年内达到现代国际贸易的先进的科学技术水平。
    几个月来，运动的实际作用究竟表现在哪里呢？
    首先，它可以使党的表扬好人好事的原则进一步具体化。在5月召开的会议上，我们曾对所有出席的先进人物进行了精神上、物质上的表扬和奖励。这种普遍的而又是有区别的表扬和奖励，对于每一个先进工作者和全体职工，都是一个极大的鼓舞。它大大地激发了职工群众的社会主义积极性和创造性，提高了他们对本职工作的热爱和责任心，从而就在整个机关中造成了一股“先进带落后、落后赶先进，先进再先进”的风气。如本部海关总署税则处，原来曾长期积压了一千二百张税单，这回在运动的影响下，只用几天工夫，便把积压的税单全部处理完毕。中国仪器进口公司光学仪器处的专管对资本主义国家贸易的小组，在先进工作者代表王汉湘的带动下，现在已经成为这个公司的先进小组。本部附设医务所一个原来从服务员中提拔起来的办事员，在先进工作者代表张大夫的培养下，已经可以担任医药统计工作了。更使人感动的是，中国运输机械进口公司财务会计处的同志们，自动地、创造性地建立了一套“事迹、事故登记卡”，正面记载先进事迹，背面记载差错事故，每人建卡一张，集中一人保管。他们是如何时刻地关心着自己对于祖国的贡献，时刻警惕地防止着任何大小差错事故的发生呵！群众反映：“批评、处分固不可无，表扬、奖励更不可少”。这是完全有道理的。
    第二，它可以使党的贯彻群众路线的原则进一步为各单位的领导人员所掌握，从而可以更好地保证领导与群众的结合。仅据运动开展以后两个月内的不完全统计，各单位已经先后收到二百五十一件合理化建议。这些建议都是职工群众针对着在实现倡议、推广经验和完成任务中存在的问题而提出的。在一部分单位，约有三分之一以上的建议，已经各级行政领导采纳和实行了。在推广现有经验中，中国进出口公司现在又已总结了七项新的工作经验。目前，不少单位的行政领导上，都要根据第二季度民主检查中揭发的问题，向全体职工提出课题，动员大家围绕课题动脑筋、想办法，积极提供关于改进工作的合理化建议。所有这些都说明，先进工作者运动的开展，已经使各级领导干部能够更密切地联系和依靠群众，更广泛地集中群众的智慧，从而必然能够更好地推动整个工作不断前进。
    第三，它可以使机关和企业的工作质量得到改进，使工作效率得到提高。如各总公司的财务会计处，一般都已响应了财务会计工作的倡议，连续地开展“季度无差错运动”，不少单位在最近三个月内已经实现了“差错不出门”的要求。有些总公司在实现提前两天上报表报的经验和倡议中，遭到了一部分下级公司工作水平赶不上要求的障碍，于是便派出干部下去进行具体帮助，以保证先进经验的顺利推行；其中粮油出口公司现已比原规定提前了四天，比过去推迟最晚上报的时候，则提前了二十二天。本部办公厅档案室公文立卷的工作效率也有很大的提高，如在运动开始前，全处每人平均立一卷，需要二小时，现在则只需五十分钟，个别最高的只需十九分钟，而且仍能保证原来的立卷质量。
    第四，它还可以使企业的经营管理获得改善，使国家对外贸易计划任务的提前完成和超额完成，获得更好的保证。例如，代表会议所提关于运输工作的倡议，曾要求各公司于本年内，在保证完成全年进出口货物运输任务的前提下，普遍降低运杂费开支5％；从目前的执行情况来看，绝大多数公司预计都能实现这个要求，其中对外贸易运输公司则可降低9.8％，即可为国家节约八百万元的运费开支。中国食品出口公司仅因采纳了关于降低水果出口损耗率和改变商品运输路线的合理化建议，预计亦可在本年内为国家增加四十万卢布和十一万元人民币的收入。中国粮油出口公司在实现倡议中，改进了出口运输和业务核算工作，最近已为国家增加了十六万元的收入。
    还要提到一下关于组织领导的问题。
    在本部直属机关，对运动的组织领导，作了这样的原则规定：“在党组织的统一领导下，由行政、工会、青年团分工负责”。这与工矿企业把先进生产者运动的工作主要交由工会组织来领导的情况，是有显著不同的。我们认为这样的不同规定，会更适合于国家机关的特殊情况，因而是适宜的。
    同时，像我们这样的国家机关，所担负的行政业务任务都是全国性的，而先进工作者运动所要实现的倡议，要推广的经验和要处理的合理化建议，又多是与整个业务工作有关的。因此，必须紧紧地依靠行政组织和行政领导的力量，才能及时有效地解决运动中的实际问题。正因为这样，所以在行政、工会和青年团间的分工负责问题上，必须特别强调各级行政领导的责任，不但必须把运动的主要组织工作交给各级行政领导来担负，而且必须同时加强各项业务工作的主管单位（如本部的各主管业务局）对于运动的专业指导。
