Xinhua News Agency, September 29th: Paris dispatch: A French Foreign Ministry spokesman stated on September 28th that Britain and France are still insisting that Egypt accept the Western plan to establish a "Suez Canal Users Association." He said that the desire of Britain and France is "to achieve a peaceful resolution (of the Suez Canal issue) on the basis of the eighteen-nation resolution."

He also said that the United States' policy on the Suez issue appears to be in "close coordination" with the common policy of France and Britain. He said: "All three governments have a common goal, which is to find a way to implement the resolution of the eighteen user nations in favor of international management of the Suez Canal."

Referring to the Anglo-French talks, the spokesman said that Britain and France would "take concerted action" in bringing the Suez issue to the United Nations Security Council and on possible future issues.

According to Agence France-Presse, Paris and London are now working to formulate a "legal basis" that would make the boycott effective. If the United Nations declares its support for the "international control" plan and Egypt refuses to agree, Britain and France will put forward this "legal basis."

Xinhua News Agency, September 29th: London dispatch: The British Foreign Office announced on the 28th that the meeting to prepare for the establishment of the "Canal Users Association" is scheduled to be held in London on October 1st. The ambassador-level meeting will be opened by British Foreign Secretary Lloyd. It is reported that at this meeting, representatives of the "Association" participating countries will elect a board of directors and an executive committee for the "Association" and appoint a general manager.

According to a United Press report, some countries that have accepted the invitation have made some reservations about the obligations undertaken to participate in the "Association."

    英法坚持夺取苏伊士运河管理权计划
    “运河使用国协会”会议即将举行
    据新华社29日讯　巴黎消息：法国外交部发言人9月28日表示，英法仍然坚持要埃及接受西方关于建立“运河使用国协会”的计划。他说，英法两国的愿望是“要在十八国决议的基础上达成（苏伊士运河问题的）和平解决”。
    他还说，美国在苏伊士问题上的政策同法国和英国的共同政策现在看来是“密切配合的”。他说：“所有这三国的政府都有一个一致的目的，就是设法使赞成国际管理苏伊士运河的十八个使用国的决议付诸实施。”
    这个发言人在谈到英法会谈时说，英法在把苏伊士问题提到联合国安全理事会以及对以后可能发生的问题上，将“采取一致行动”。
    据法新社报道，巴黎和伦敦现在努力要做的是制订一个使得抵制有效的“法律基础”。如果联合国宣布支持“国际管制”计划，而埃及拒绝同意，英法就会把这种“法律基础”提出来。
    据新华社29日讯　伦敦消息：英国外交部28日宣布：准备成立“运河使用国协会”的会议定10月1日在伦敦举行。这个大使级的会议将由英国外交大臣劳埃德主持开幕。据报道，在这个会议上，“协会”参加国的代表将为“协会”选举出一个董事会和一个执行委员会，并且任命一个总经理。
    据合众社消息说，有些已经接受邀请的国家对参加“协会”所承担的义务作了一些保留。
