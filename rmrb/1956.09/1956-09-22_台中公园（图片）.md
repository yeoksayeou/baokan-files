    Taichung Park (Traditional Chinese Painting) Lin Guanming
    Taichung Park is the only good place to visit in Taichung City, Taiwan Province. There is a lake in the park, which is several miles around. The lake water is clear and you can row a small boat. The trees along the lake are strong and vigorous. The moonlit night can arouse the interest of tourists. There is a small pavilion in the lake called "Lake Heart Pavilion".

    台中公园（国画）　林冠明
    台中公园是台湾省台中市唯一的游览好地方。园中有湖，方圆数里，湖水清澈见底，可泛小舟。沿湖树木苍劲，有月亮的夜晚，更能引起游客的兴趣。湖中有小亭，名叫“湖心亭”。
