　　In theatrical work, a single sentence from certain individuals can have an immense impact. Leaving aside the positive aspects, many plays have suffered because of this, in terms of negative consequences. For example, in Shangzhi County, Heilongjiang Province, when a troupe wanted to perform “The Fisherman’s Revenge,” a cadre said the play conflicted with the current central task of delivering public grain and could not be performed. In Xi’an, a cadre said “The Story of the Pipa” spread tragic emotions and could not be performed. Furthermore, “Granny Liu Visits the Grand View Garden” was said to be insulting to the working people; “Xi Shi” was said to be glorifying a female spy; any play (from ancient times) with a man and two wives was in violation of marriage law; any play with ghosts promoted superstition… In short, there were many prohibitions.

　　And there were many cadres who came out to say these things. Not only did some cadres from cultural departments come out to speak, but also cadres from some public security bureaus, tax bureaus, trade unions, cooperatives, department stores, district and village cadres, militia… they all had something to say. Their words carried a lot of weight with the performers. Some were even rigid regulations: “Forbidden to perform!” It is not known who gave them such authority.

　　Some cadres conducted "tutoring" for the performers, and some cadres conducted "research" on the plays. As a result, a batch of plays was "tutored" away, and another batch of plays was "researched" away. Some cadres simply shook their heads, and another batch of plays was finished. Some cadres didn't even shake their heads, remaining noncommittal, but it had the same effect, because if they didn't nod in approval, the performers wouldn't dare to perform. Moreover, it was said that the performers "voluntarily stopped performing" or "voluntarily gave up".

　　Speaking a single sentence is so easy and effortless. But a large number of plays have suffered as a result. Performers call it "death by a single word." It is true that many of the plays produced in the old era contain dross and even poison, so there is a need for reform. Reform is a delicate task; simply "killing it with a single word" is the work style of an ignorant spendthrift.

    不能漠视的“作风”
    屠岸
    在戏曲工作中，有些人说了一句话会起极大的作用。好的方面且按下不表，单从坏的方面看，许多剧目都因此遭了殃。举例说：黑龙江省尚志县有的剧团要演“打渔杀家”，干部说：此剧与当前中心任务送公粮有抵触，不能演；西安市有一位干部说：“琵琶记”散布悲惨情绪，不能演；此外，诸如“刘姥姥游大观园”被说成是侮辱劳动人民的；“西施”被说成是歌颂女特务的；凡是有一夫二妻的戏（古代的）都违反婚姻法；凡是出鬼的戏都是宣传迷信……。总之，禁条多得很。
    而出来说这些话的干部也非常多。不仅某些文化主管部门的干部要出来说话，某些公安局、税务局、工会、合作社、百货公司的干部，区村干部，民兵……也都要出来说话。他们的话对艺人来说，都是很有分量的。有的甚至是硬性规定：“禁演！”也不知是谁赋予他们这样的权力的。
    有些干部对艺人进行“辅导”，有些干部对剧目进行“研究”，结果是“辅导”掉了一批剧目，又“研究”掉了一批剧目；有些干部只是摇一摇头，一批剧目又完蛋了；有些干部连头也不摇，不置可否，也起同样的作用，因为他不点头，艺人就不敢演出。而且，据说还是艺人“自动停演”或“自愿放弃”的。
    说一句话，何其轻而易举，真是不费吹灰之力。可是大批剧目却就此遭了殃。艺人们称之为“一言以毙之”。诚然，产生在旧时代的剧目，其中有不少是杂有糟粕乃至毒素的，所以有改革之必要。改革是件细致的工作，简简单单地“一言以毙之”，那是无知的败家子作风。
