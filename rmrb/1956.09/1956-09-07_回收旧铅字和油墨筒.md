    Recycling Old Lead Type and Ink Cartridges
    Lead type that is damaged or broken cannot be used again. If you sell it! Nobody wants it; if you throw it away, it's a pity. Lead type is a metal product, although it cannot be used again when it is broken, it can still be melted and replicated. I hope relevant departments find a way to recycle it.
    Each ink cartridge, after the ink is used up, can definitely be refilled with ink. I also hope relevant departments set a price for recycling them.

    回收旧铅字和油墨筒
    铅字使坏了或折断了，不能再用。卖吧！没人要；丢掉吧，很可惜。铅字是金属制品，虽然坏了不能再用，但是还可以熔化复制，希望有关部门设法回收。
    每筒油墨用完后，完全可以再装油墨，也希望有关部门订价回收。
