Xinhua News Agency, September 12th, Bangkok Dispatch: According to a report in the "Siam People's Newspaper" on September 7th, the Thai Deputy Minister of Interior and Police Director-General, Nai Pao Sriyanond, stated on September 5th while talking to the press about some parties smearing China with "aggression" against Burma, that it cannot be considered that China is aggressing against Burma because the Sino-Burmese border has not been completely and definitively determined.

Xinhua News Agency, September 12th, Rangoon Dispatch: An editorial published in the Burmese newspaper "Han Chiao Yue Li Bao" on September 8th stated that the Thai Prime Minister Phibun's slanderous remarks on September 6th accusing China of "aggression" against Burma "are motivated by ulterior motives."

The editorial stated that Burmese Prime Minister U Nu had pointed out at a recent press conference that the Burmese government had not said that China had "aggressed" against Burma.

The editorial stated, we believe that the rhetoric of Phibun, who said, "If the United Nations makes a decision on Red China's aggression against Burma, Thailand is ready to provide Burma with military assistance at any time," "cannot be ignored." The editorial pointed out that just as the Burmese and Chinese governments were conducting peaceful consultations on the border issue between the two countries, "Thailand - this anti-communist member state of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, issued such remarks with ulterior motives."

Xinhua News Agency, September 13th, Bangkok Dispatch: Many influential newspapers in Thailand have criticized Prime Minister Phibun's slanderous remarks made a few days ago accusing China of "aggression" against Burma and expressing his intention to send troops to Burma to participate in combat operations.

The "Siam People's Newspaper" editorial on September 8th stated that the Thai Prime Minister's remarks on the Sino-Burmese border issue were astonishing. This "gives the impression that our Prime Minister is a person who is ready for war at any time; it sounds like an echo of US Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Radford."

The "Liberty Communication Newspaper" editorial on September 7th stated that Phibun's remarks will inevitably make Burma feel that "the Thai government has interfered in their affairs a little too much."

    泰国内政部副部长说中缅边界仍未确定
    不能认为中国侵略缅甸
    缅泰舆论谴责銮披汶对中国的污蔑别有用心
    据新华社12日讯　曼谷消息：据“暹罗群众报”9月7日报道，泰国内政部副部长兼警察总监乃炮·是耶暖9月5日在同报界谈到某些方面污蔑中国“侵略”缅甸的问题的时候说，不能认为中国侵略缅甸，因为中缅边界还没有完全肯定地规定下来。
    新华社仰光12日电　缅文“罕瞧越利报”9月8日发表的社论说，泰国总理銮披汶在9月6日发表污蔑中国“侵略”缅甸的谈话“是别有用心的”。
    社论说，缅甸总理吴巴瑞在最近的记者招待会上曾经指出，缅甸政府并没有说过中国“侵略”缅甸的话。
    社论说，我们认为，对于銮披汶所说“如果联合国就红色中国侵略缅甸作出决定，泰国准备随时给予缅甸以军事上的援助”的论调，“是不能置之不理的”。社论指出，正当缅中两国政府就两国边境问题进行和平协商的时候，“泰国——这个反共的东南亚条约组织成员国家发表这种言论是别有用心的”。
    据新华社13日讯　曼谷消息：泰国许多家有影响的报纸抨击总理銮披汶在前几天发表的污蔑中国“侵略”缅甸并且表示要派军队到缅甸去参加作战行动的谈话。
     “暹罗群众报”9月8日的社论说，泰国总理发表的有关中缅边境问题的谈话是令人惊讶的。这“使人感到，我们的总理是一个随时准备战争的人，听来仿佛就是美国参谋长联席会议主席雷德福的回声。”
     “自由通讯报”9月7日的社论说，銮披汶的谈话一定会使缅甸不得不感到“泰国政府未免有些过份地干涉了他们的事务”。
