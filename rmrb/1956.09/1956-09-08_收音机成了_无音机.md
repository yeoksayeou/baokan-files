    Radio Becomes a "Soundless Machine"
    In March of this year, I bought a "Beijing brand" four-tube radio at the Shanghai No. 1 Department Store. It broke down in less than a month. First, it often suddenly made a lot of noise, then sometimes the sound was incredibly low, and finally, there was simply no sound at all. After two repairs by the Shanghai People's Broadcasting Station service department, it was always ineffective due to the poor product quality. Later, with the consent of the Shanghai No. 1 Department Store, I returned this "soundless machine" on June 17th, and they negotiated with the original manufacturer for a refund. Recently, the Shanghai No. 1 Department Store sent a letter notifying me that they had written to the original manufacturer twice, but had received no reply.
    I believe that this radio factory is already wrong for not paying attention to product quality, and it is even more wrong for not dealing with its own defective products with a serious and responsible attitude. I hope this factory will quickly find a way to remedy this.　Cheng Shaozheng

### 收音机成了“无音机”

    收音机成了“无音机”
    今年三月间，我在上海第一百货商店买了一只“北京牌”四灯收音机。用了不到一个月，就出了毛病。先是常常忽然杂音大作，后来有时候声音低得出奇，最后就索性没有声音了。经过上海人民广播电台服务部两次检修，因为产品质量太差，总是无效。后来，征得上海第一百货商店同意，在六月十七日把这只“无音机”送回，由他们向原生产厂交涉退货。最近，上海第一百货商店来信通知，他们曾经两次写信给原生产厂，但是都没有回信。
    我认为，这个无线电厂不注意产品质量已是错误，现在对自己生产的次品又不以认真负责的态度来处理，就更不应该。希望这个厂赶快设法补救。　程绍铮
