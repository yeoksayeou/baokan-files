Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, August 31st: Liaoning Province's more than four million hectares of autumn crops are expected to have a bumper harvest. According to preliminary estimates from various counties and cities, the province's total grain output this year will reach eight million tons, an increase of about 30% compared to last year.

Currently, the main grain crop in Liaoning Province, sorghum, has generally been harvested; corn kernels are mostly full and plump, with thick stalks and large cobs; the heavy ears of rice are drooping; and soybean pods are generally 20% to 30% more than last year.

Since the beginning of autumn, agricultural cooperatives in Liaoning Province have continued to carry out various production increase and harvest protection activities on the basis of overcoming spring and summer weed and insect pests. In the past, artificial pollination of corn was not customary in most areas; this year, after the widespread promotion of this yield-increasing technology, about 30% to 40% of the corn in general agricultural cooperatives was artificially pollinated. Field management of crops such as sorghum, corn, rice, and soybeans has also been strengthened. In order to prevent crops from being damaged by wild animals, agricultural cooperatives in some areas have also organized autumn protection teams.

In late August, widespread rain across the province was even more conducive to crop growth. According to cadres from the Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau, the area of farmland affected by disasters in the province this year is less than in any previous year.

Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, August 30th: This year, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region's more than five million mu of oil crops have achieved a high increase in production. Flax is now on the market, and castor beans are also ripe. According to recent estimates from the Autonomous Region's Department of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry and the Oil Company, based on reports from various places, the average yield per mu of oil crops in the region exceeds that of the bumper harvest year of 1954 by more than 13%. The total output can reach more than 190,000 tons, reaching the original planned target for this year.

The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is one of China's important industrial oil crop producing areas. The output of castor beans, which it produces to manufacture high-grade lubricating oil, ranks first in the country. Flax is also an oil crop with a large output in the region. In addition, there are sunflowers, hemp, sesame, rapeseed, Su seeds, and peanuts.

The amount of oil crops transported out of the Autonomous Region every year is very large. This year, most of the 120,000 tons of oil crops planned for purchase in the region will be transported outside the region. Because of the increase in oil crop production, ethnic minority farmers in the Autonomous Region will also retain more oil for their own use than in previous years.

Xinhua News Agency, Shabamiao, August 30th: This year, the grain crops in the Houtao area of the Yellow River in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region will exceed the unit area yield and total output targets of the first Five-Year Plan by more than 20%. If autumn harvesting and disaster prevention work are further improved, the output will be even higher. This was announced today by the person in charge of the Hetao Administrative Region at the regional autumn production conference.

The Yellow River Houtao area, which has basically achieved advanced cooperativization, has an unprecedented bumper harvest of grain crops this year. The planting area of high-yield crops such as corn and sorghum has also set a historical record. According to field observations and estimates by the agricultural departments of various banners and counties, the average yield per mu of land in the region can reach more than 230 jin. In Hangjinhou Banner, known as the "Granary South of the Desert," the yield per mu can reach 288 jin. If there are no unexpected major disasters in the future, nearly 400,000 Mongolian, Han, and other ethnic farmers on the Hetao Plain will harvest more than 830 million jin of grain. This output is more than twice that of the early days of liberation.

    辽宁今年粮食总产量可增加三成
    内蒙油料作物产量很高，后套粮食产量超过五年计划指标
    据新华社沈阳31日电　辽宁省四百多万公顷大秋作物可望普遍丰收。根据各县、市的初步估计，今年全省粮食总产量将达到八百万吨，比去年增加30％左右。
    现在，辽宁省的主要粮食作物高粱已经普遍晒米；玉米子粒大部定浆丰实，秆粗棒大；水稻肥大的穗儿沉沉下垂；大豆结荚一般比去年多20％到30％。
    入秋以来，辽宁省各地农业社在战胜春、夏两季草荒、虫害的基础上，继续不懈地展开了各种增产保收活动。往年玉米人工辅助授粉在多数地区都没有习惯；今年各地普遍推广这一增产技术以后，一般农业社实行人工辅助授粉的玉米约占30％到40％。高粱、玉米、水稻、大豆等作物的田间管理工作，也都有所加强。为了防止庄稼被野兽糟蹋，有些地区的农业社还组织了护秋队。
    8月下旬，全省各地普降透雨，就更加有利于作物的生长。据省水利局的干部谈，今年全省农田受灾面积比以往任何一年都少。
    新华社呼和浩特30日电　内蒙古自治区五百多万亩油料作物今年获得高额增产。现在亚麻已经上市，蓖麻也已成熟。据自治区农牧厅和油脂公司最近根据各地汇报材料预计：全区油料作物每亩平均产量超过1954年大丰收年份的13％多。总产量可达十九万多吨，达到今年原订计划指标。
    内蒙古自治区是我国重要工业用油料作物产区之一。它生产的制造高级润滑油的蓖麻，产量占全国第一位。亚麻也是全区产量很大的油料作物，此外，还有向日葵、大麻、芝麻、油菜籽、苏籽和花生等。
    自治区每年外运的油料作物数量很大，今年全区计划收购的十二万吨油料大部分将运往区外。因为油料作物增产，自治区各族农民自留油料也将比往年增多。
    新华社陕坝30日电　内蒙古自治区黄河后套的粮食作物，今年将超额20％以上完成第一个五年计划的单位面积产量和总产量指标。如果进一步作好秋收和防灾工作，产量还会提高。这是河套行政区负责人今天在全区秋季生产会议上宣布的。
    基本上实现了高级合作化的黄河后套，今年粮食作物空前丰收。玉米、高粱等高产作物的播种面积也创造了历史上最高纪录。根据各旗、县农业部门的田间观测和推算，全区每亩土地的平均产量可达二百三十多斤。向有“漠南粮仓”之称的杭锦后旗，每亩产量能达二百八十八斤。今后如无意外特大灾害，河套平原上近四十万蒙、汉等民族农民，将收获八亿三千多万斤粮食。这个产量比解放初期提高了两倍多。
