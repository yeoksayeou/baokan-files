    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 7th—The Chairman of the Japanese Socialist Party, Mosaburo Suzuki, issued a statement yesterday advocating that, under the current circumstances, the Japanese negotiations should be resolved by concluding a provisional agreement.
    Leading cadres of the Socialist Party held a meeting in Tokyo yesterday to discuss their attitude toward the Japan-Soviet negotiations. After the discussion, Suzuki Mosaburo's statement was issued, stating the Socialist Party's policy on the Japan-Soviet negotiations.
    Suzuki's statement said that the Japan-Soviet negotiations should reach an agreement and conclude a peace treaty. However, in view of the current domestic and international situation, it seems very difficult to conclude a peace treaty. Therefore, the Socialist Party believes that expedient measures should be taken to conclude a provisional agreement to achieve the following: End the state of war, repatriate detainees, exchange ambassadors, bring the Japan-Soviet Fisheries Treaty into effect, and support Japan's participation in the United Nations.
    The Socialist Party's official attitude toward the Japan-Soviet negotiations will be decided by the Central Executive Committee on September 15.

    日本社会党主张缔结日苏临时协定
    新华社7日讯　东京消息：日本社会党主席铃木茂三郎昨天发表声明，主张在目前情况下，通过缔结临时协定的方式使日本谈判获得解决。
    社会党领导干部昨天在东京举行会议，讨论了对日苏谈判的态度。讨论结束后，发表了铃木茂三郎的声明，表明了社会党对日苏谈判的方针。
    铃木的声明说，日苏谈判应该达成协议，缔结和约。但是，鉴于目前的国内外形势，看来缔结和约非常困难，因此，社会党认为应该采取权宜措施，缔结临时协定，使下列各项得到实现：结束战争状态，遣返被拘留人员，互换大使，使日苏渔业条约生效，使日本参加联合国一事获得支持。
    社会党对日苏谈判的正式态度，将由中央执行委员会在9月15日决定。
