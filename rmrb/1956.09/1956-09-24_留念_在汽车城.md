    Remembrance
    —In Automobile City
    Ding Ye

    In the joyous crowd, I saw you—the smile of expert Luyev Lyov. You are busy! While applauding and cheering, you want to use your "Moskvich" camera to capture us, a group of people who just got into the car, into the picture. The silver souvenir you have kept for a long, long time no longer shines on your chest, but who can forget it? In an urgent silver soldering experiment, you melted it behind our backs and poured it into our car... I heard you are going back to Moscow. When you came, this was a barren land; when you leave, this is a cheering crowd. You are excitedly busy, taking a farewell photo. Ah, Comrade Luyev Lyov, how many eyes are watching you, your strong figure, your friendly smile, your silver souvenir... all have been deeply imprinted in our hearts.

    留念
    ——在汽车城
    丁耶在欢腾的人海里，我看到了你呀——卢耶夫略夫专家的笑容。你在忙碌着哇！一边鼓掌欢呼，一边想用你那“莫斯科人”像机，把我们这群刚坐上汽车的人，摄入影中。你那保存了好久好久的银质纪念品，已不再闪耀在你的胸前，可是，谁能忘记它呢，在一次急需银焊的试验里，你背着我们，将它溶化了浇注在我们的汽车中……听说你要回莫斯科了，你来时，这里是一片荒地；你去时，这里是万人欢腾；你在兴奋地忙碌着哇，为拍摄一张临别留影。啊，卢耶夫略夫同志，我们多少只眼睛在望着你哪，你那健壮的身影，你那友谊的笑容，你那银质纪念品……都已深深地摄入我们的心中。
