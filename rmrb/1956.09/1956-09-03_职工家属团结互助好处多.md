    Many Benefits from Solidarity and Mutual Assistance Among Families of Employees
    Lin Ling
    In 1953, hundreds of employee families from a factory in Beijing, scattered in all directions, moved to the Hepingli Employee Family Dormitory and became neighbors. According to the distance of their residences, they organized family mutual aid groups by district and group. Speaking of solidarity and mutual assistance, the family members all said: "In our area, the No. 1 large group in Zone 6 is the best in solidarity and mutual assistance."
    The twenty-four employee families in the No. 1 large group in Zone 6 have a common ideal: "If family members unite and help each other, increasing employee attendance rates, we will also be contributing to socialist construction!" To realize this ideal, they launched mutual assistance in labor, learning, and economics.
    Mutual assistance in labor takes various forms. In the past three years, twenty-nine children have been born to the twenty-four families. When a woman gives birth, neighbors are responsible for inviting doctors, taking care of the children, cooking, washing clothes, and shopping. Generally, family members take shifts to take care of the postpartum woman for twelve days, and if the postpartum woman is sick, the family members take extra care. For example, when Wu Xiuqin gave birth, her husband, Wang Runliang, originally planned to ask for leave to take care of her, but the neighbors said to Wang Runliang: "You can go to work with peace of mind, we have a mutual aid group to take care of her!" With the help of neighbors, Wang Runliang went to the factory with peace of mind. On a morning in June this year, when Wang Xiying, a family member, was about to give birth, neighbors Feng Guifen and Wang Huizhen took her to the hospital, and she gave birth to a child safely. A few days later, the neighbors took her home from the hospital. When Wang Xiying was admitted to and discharged from the hospital, her husband stayed at his post with peace of mind. These are just two random examples. When employee family members give birth, everyone is like this, and no employee is absent from work because his wife is giving birth.
    In the past three years, nine sick employee family members have also received the kind care of their neighbors, which has not affected employee attendance. The mother of employee Li Molin fell and injured her back, and slept in a plaster bed for a hundred days. Li Molin has many children, and his wife can't take care of them all, so the employee family members took shifts to buy things and take care of the children for his family. Li Molin did not take a day off because his mother was sick. After the old lady recovered, she went to each household to thank the neighbors and said: "I have lived for such a long time, and this is the first time I have met such good neighbors." In addition, scattered daily life labor assistance is even more common. For example, helping families with many children to buy things and take care of children, helping pregnant women clean the yard, carry water, and carry flour, have all become natural things for employee family members to do.
    The employee families responded to the call of the trade union to educate children so as not to affect the rest of employees on the night shift, and also organized a children's tutoring group. Thirty-two children between the ages of three and school age participated in the children's tutoring group, and eight family members served as tutors. Every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 8:00 to 9:00 in the morning, and from 6:00 to 7:30 in the evening, they conduct five-love education for children, teach them hygiene knowledge, and play games with them. Family members are satisfied and say: "The children have learned well in the children's tutoring group." For example, Liu Liangzuo's child, Xiao Liu, is seven years old. He used to often make noise in front of the window of employee Bai Shoupeng, affecting Bai Shoupeng's rest. Grandma Bai had no choice but to give Xiao Liu a penny to send him away, but she still couldn't stop Xiao Liu from making noise. Later, under the education of the children's tutoring group, Xiao Liu became sensible. Sometimes when other children came to play in front of Bai Shoupeng's window, he would quietly lead them away, ensuring Bai Shoupeng's quiet rest.
    Employee families also help each other in their studies. Twenty-two family members under the age of fifty in the group have participated in cultural studies. Fourteen people participated in family study classes, studying books for elementary school, senior elementary school, and junior high school respectively; eight people participated in literacy groups. Family member Zhu Xianzhen taught the family members of the literacy group while studying herself. Many family members organized small mutual aid groups of two people, taking turns to study and take turns to take care of the children. When some family members went to school, neighbors often bought vegetables for her when she came back. The difficulties in family study have been solved by everyone's mutual assistance, so all young and middle-aged family members have participated in the study, and no one has dropped out of school halfway. The learning performance generally reached above 80 points. On the basis of learning culture, family members further demanded to learn more knowledge. In recent months, family members have been studying "Chinese Women" every Saturday. The "Chinese Women" magazine was bought with the interest from the family mutual aid fund!
    The mutual aid fund is a kind of economic mutual assistance for family members. The mutual aid fund has solved many economic difficulties for family members. Before saving the mutual aid fund, some family members often asked the factory trade union to borrow money when they were sick, gave birth, or needed money urgently. With the family mutual aid fund, family members with temporary difficulties can easily borrow it. When Wang Xiuying had a miscarriage, she had no money at home, and her husband was not at home, so the family members went to the bank to withdraw the deposit and called a car to send her to the hospital; Wang Lu's child, Delong, had measles and had no money to hire a doctor, so the mutual aid fund was also used to solve the problem. From November 1953 to July this year, family members borrowed money from the savings association more than seventy times, solving various temporary difficulties such as family members' illness and childbirth, and reducing the burden on the factory trade union and employees.
    Family members unite and help each other, truly achieving what they said, "If you need someone, there is someone; if you need money, there is money." Employees are not burdened by family affairs at all and concentrate on doing a good job in production. This year, among the twenty-four employees, seven employees became advanced producers in the factory, one of whom was also elected as an advanced producer in Beijing, and two employees became young socialist construction activists in the factory. Employee family members feel honored for this, and they said that they will further unite and help each other, and play a role that family members should play in the socialist construction of the motherland.

    Zhu Xianzhen, an employee family member who has always been enthusiastic about helping neighbors, has not had children for eight years after her marriage; in August this year, she gave birth to her first daughter, and the neighbors all came to congratulate her.

    职工家属团结互助好处多
    林凌
    1953年，北京某工厂的几百户分散在四面八方的职工家属们，迁到和平里职工家属宿舍，成了近邻。他们按居住远近，分区、分组组织起家属互助组。提起团结互助，家属们都说：“我们这儿，要数六区一大组团结互助得好了。”
    六区一大组二十四户职工家属有一个共同的理想：“家属们团结互助，增加职工出勤率，也是我们为社会主义建设出一分力量啊！”为了实现这个理想，他们在劳动上，学习上，经济上展开了互助。
    劳动上的互助是各式各样的。三年来，二十四户家属中，生育了二十九个小孩。产妇生孩子的时候，请大夫，看孩子，做饭，洗衣服，买东西都是由邻居担当。一般的产妇，家属分班伺候她十二天，有病的产妇，家属还多加照顾。像吴秀琴生小孩，她的丈夫王润良本打算请假来照顾她的，邻居对王润良说：“你只管放心上班去得了，照顾她，有我们互助组呢！”有了邻居帮助，王润良安心地到工厂去了。今年6月一天的清早，家属王锡英临产的时候，是由邻居冯桂芬和王惠珍把她送到医院的，她平安地生了小孩。几天以后，邻居们又从医院把她接回家来。王锡英入院、出院的时候，她的丈夫都安心地留在工作岗位上。这只是随便举两个例子。职工家属生育的时候，个个都是这样，没有一个职工因为爱人生孩子而缺勤。
    三年中，有九个得病的职工家属同样得到邻居们的亲切照顾，没有影响职工出勤。职工李墨林的母亲跌伤了腰，睡石膏床一百天。李墨林的孩子多，他爱人照看不过来，职工家属便分班替他家买东西，看孩子。李墨林没有因母亲生病请一天假。老太太病好了，到各户谢邻居说：“我活这么大年纪了，头一回遇见这么好的邻居。”此外，零零碎碎日常生活中的劳动互助就更普遍了。比方帮助孩子多的家属买东西，看孩子啦，帮助孕妇打扫院子，担水、扛面啦，这都成为职工家属们自自然然要做的事情了。
    职工家属们响应工会关于教育儿童不影响夜班职工休息的号召，还组织了儿童辅导组。三十二个三周岁到学龄前的儿童，都参加了儿童辅导组，由八个家属担当辅导员。每星期一、三、五早八点到九点，和晚六点到七点半，对儿童进行五爱教育，给他们讲卫生常识，做游戏。家属们满意地说：“孩子在儿童辅导组学好了。”像刘良佐的孩子小六，七岁了，以前常常在职工柏寿鹏窗前吵嚷，影响柏寿鹏休息，柏奶奶没办法就给小六一分钱把他支开，可是，仍然不能使小六不吵。以后，在儿童辅导组教育下，小六懂事了，有时别的孩子到柏寿鹏家窗前玩，他还悄悄地把他们领走。保证了柏寿鹏安静的休息。
    职工家属们在学习中也互相帮助，全组有二十二个五十岁以下的家属都参加了文化学习。有十四个人参加家属学习班，分别学习初小、高小、初中的书；有八个人参加识字组。家属朱娴贞一边自己学习，一边还教识字组的家属。不少家属组织起两个人的小互助组，倒班去学习，倒班看孩子。有些家属去上学了，回来的时候，邻居常常已经把青菜给她买回来了。家属学习的困难，大家互助都解决了，所以全部青壮年家属都参加了学习，从来没有人中途退学。学习成绩一般达到了八十分以上。在学习文化的基础上，家属们进一步要求学习更多的知识。近几个月来，每逢星期六家属们就学习“中国妇女”。“中国妇女”杂志，还是用家属互助金的利息买的呢！
    互助金，这是家属们经济上的一种互助。互助金解决了家属不少经济上的困难。在没有储存互助金以前，有些家属生病，生孩子，临时急用钱，常常让职工向厂工会去借。有了家属互助金，有临时困难的家属就可以很方便地去借用。家属王秀英流产的时候，家里没有钱，她丈夫也不在家，家属们便到银行取了存款，叫了汽车把她送进医院；王路的小孩德龙出疹子，没钱请大夫，也是用互助金解决了困难。从1953年11月到今年7月，家属向储金会借款有七十次之多，解决了家属生病、生孩子等各种临时困难，为厂工会和职工减少了负担。
    家属们团结互助，真正做到了像她们所说的“用人有人，用钱有钱”，职工根本不为家事所牵累，一心搞好生产。今年，二十四户职工中，有七名职工当了厂的先进生产者，其中一名职工还当选了北京市先进生产者，两名职工当了厂的青年社会主义建设积极分子。职工家属为此感到光荣，她们表示还要进一步团结互助，在祖国社会主义建设中，起家属应起的一分作用。（附图片）
    一贯热心帮助邻居的职工家属朱娴贞，婚后八年没有生育；今年8月，她生了一个头胎女儿，邻居们都来向她庆贺。
