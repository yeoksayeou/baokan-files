　　Xinhua News Agency, 3rd dispatch from Cairo: As the representatives of the "Five-Nation Suez Canal Committee" arrived in Cairo, Egyptian public opinion clearly stated that Egypt would never accept the so-called solution to the Suez Canal issue formulated by Western countries, which would harm Egypt's sovereignty and national dignity.
　　The "Republic" newspaper published an open letter to Menzies, the chairman of the Five-Nation Committee, on the front page of September 2nd. The newspaper stated, "The Egyptians are as stubborn as they are patient. They are a nation that yearns for peace. But if their sovereignty is violated, they will resolutely fight."
　　The "Republic" newspaper said that the West does not recognize any sovereignty other than its own. But Egypt is very tenacious. Supporting Egypt are the Arabs, and behind them are the Asians and Africans.
　　The "People's News" said, "Although Menzies' committee has been established to discuss principles that Egypt has already rejected, we will not neglect them as Western newspapers predict.
　　"We will forget everything that would cast a shadow on the negotiating atmosphere and welcome them appropriately. But we will not welcome them at the expense of our dignity. Our welcoming this committee does not mean we welcome the plan they are carrying."

    埃及舆论一致表示
    埃及不接受有损主权的计划
    据新华社3日讯　开罗消息：在“五国苏彝士运河委员会”的代表到达开罗的时候，埃及舆论明白表示，埃及决不接受西方国家拟定的有损埃及主权和民族尊严的所谓解决苏彝士运河问题的计划。
    “共和国报”9月2日在第一版刊登了致五国委员会主席孟席斯的公开信。这家报纸说，“埃及人倔强的程度就像他们忍耐的程度一样。他们是一个热望和平的民族。但是如果他们的主权受到侵犯，他们就要毅然决然进行斗争。”
    “共和国报”说，西方除了它自己的主权以外是不承认任何主权的。但是埃及很顽强。支持埃及的有阿拉伯人，为他们的后盾的有亚洲人和非洲人。
    “人民报”说，“虽然孟席斯的委员会已经成立了来讨论埃及已经拒绝的原则，我们还是不像西方报纸预测的那样怠慢他们。
    “我们将忘掉会使谈判气氛阴沉的一切东西，适当地欢迎他们。但是我们不以牺牲我们的尊严来欢迎他们。我们欢迎这个委员会并不等于我们欢迎他们携带的方案。”
