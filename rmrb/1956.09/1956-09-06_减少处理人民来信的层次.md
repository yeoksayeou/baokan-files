    Reduce the Number of Levels in Handling People's Letters
    To the Editor:
    I have a suggestion regarding the way central government agencies handle people's letters.

  We often receive people's letters forwarded from various central ministries, which in turn were forwarded to them by the State Council or the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party to various ministries and then to local governments for handling, so it takes a very long time. For example, we recently received two letters from the Veterans Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Internal Affairs regarding demobilized soldiers requesting placement assistance. The letters were sent from Dongyang on July 1st to the State Council. The State Council received them on July 7th, assigned a document number, and then forwarded them to the Ministry of Internal Affairs. The Ministry of Internal Affairs, after assigning a document number on July 13th, finally delivered them to the county People's Committee for processing on July 23rd. Another example is Ren Jisan, a demobilized construction soldier from our county, who wrote to the General Office of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party on January 21st this year, reflecting that the leadership in Dongyang County did not pay enough attention to the placement of demobilized soldiers. The General Office of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party forwarded the letter to the Ministry of Internal Affairs. The Veterans Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Internal Affairs forwarded it to the Zhejiang Provincial People's Committee on February 22nd. The Zhejiang Provincial People's Committee forwarded it to the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Civil Affairs. In March, the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Civil Affairs directly handed it over to the Dongyang County People's Committee for handling. As a result of this layer-by-layer forwarding, a people's letter "traveled" for a full two months, and in the end, it was still handed over to the local government for handling. We believe that if the General Office of the State Council or the General Office of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party directly handled some people's letters to the local government, wouldn't it shorten the time considerably? If the problem reflected in the letter is "important," then it can be directly handled by the relevant departments of the province, without forwarding it further down.

### 减少处理人民来信的层次

    减少处理人民来信的层次编辑同志：
    我对中央机关处理人民来信的办法提一个意见。
  我们经常收到中央各部转来的人民来信，这些信又都是由国务院或中共中央转各部再转地方政府办理的，所以要耽搁很长时间。如最近我们接到内务部优抚局转来有关复员军人要求安置工作的信两件，信是7月1日从东阳寄给国务院的，国务院7月7日收文编号后，又转给内务部，内务部在7月13日作了收文编号以后，于7月23日才交到本县人民委员会处理。再如本县复员转业建设军人任及三于今年1月21日向中共中央办公厅反映：东阳县领导上不重视复员军人安置工作的问题，中共中央办公厅将信转给内务部，内务部优抚局于2月22日转给浙江省人民委员会，浙江省人民委员会转给浙江省民政厅，3月份，浙江省民政厅又直接交到东阳县人民委员会办理。这样层层照转的结果，使一封人民来信，在“途中”足足游历了两个月的时间，最后还是交到当地政府处理。我们认为国务院办公厅或中共中央办公厅对有些人民来信直接给当地政府办理，不是可以缩短很多时间吗？如果来信所反映的问题“重要”，那么，可以交省的有关部门直接处理，不要再交下来。
