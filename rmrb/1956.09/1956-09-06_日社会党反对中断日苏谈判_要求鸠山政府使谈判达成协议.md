Xinhua News Agency, 5th dispatch from Tokyo: The Japanese Socialist Party Chairman Suzuki, Secretary-General Asanuma, and fourteen other senior leading cadres met today and decided to resolutely oppose the interruption and breakdown of the Soviet-Japanese negotiations, demanding that the Hatoyama Cabinet reach an agreement.

The meeting also decided to request the Hatoyama Cabinet to convene an extraordinary session of the Diet and a meeting of the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee as soon as possible, where the plenipotentiary representatives to the Soviet-Japanese negotiations, Shigemitsu and Matsumoto, will report on the Soviet-Japanese negotiation issues.

Regarding the issue of Japanese Prime Minister Hatoyama's visit to the Soviet Union, Socialist Party Secretary-General Asanuma expressed his support at the meeting, saying: "Prime Minister Hatoyama should visit the Soviet Union now to reach an agreement on the negotiations." The meeting decided not to oppose Hatoyama's visit to the Soviet Union, but will formally make a decision to urge Hatoyama to visit the Soviet Union after observing the future movements of the ruling party.

Prior to this meeting, Japanese Socialist Party Chairman Suzuki Mosaburo had issued a statement on the 2nd, criticizing American interference in the Soviet-Japanese negotiations, saying that it "is very regrettable." He said that the United States' actions "create serious consequences of American interference in (Japan's) internal affairs, making it more difficult to reach an agreement on the negotiations."

Suzuki explained the Socialist Party's policy of striving for an early agreement in the Soviet-Japanese negotiations and the normalization of Soviet-Japanese relations, and stated that they would urge the Hatoyama Cabinet according to this policy.

    日社会党反对中断日苏谈判
    要求鸠山政府使谈判达成协议
    新华社5日讯　东京消息：日本社会党主席铃木和总书记浅沼等十四位高级负责干部今天开会商定坚决反对使日苏谈判中断和破裂，要求鸠山内阁使谈判达成协议。
    会议并且决定要求鸠山内阁早日召开国会临时会议和众议院外务委员会会议，由出席苏日谈判的全权代表重光和松本报告苏日谈判问题。
    对于日本首相鸠山访苏问题，社会党总书记浅沼在会上表示赞同说：“鸠山首相现在应该访问苏联，使谈判达成协议”。会议决定不反对鸠山访苏，但是要看今后执政党的动向再正式作出促使鸠山访苏的决定。
    在这次会议以前，日本社会党主席铃木茂三郎曾经在2日发表谈话指责美国干预日苏谈判说，这“令人感到非常遗憾”。他说，美国这样做“造成美国干涉（日本）内政的严重后果，使谈判达成协议更加困难了”。
    铃木说明了社会党主张使苏日谈判早日达成协议，使苏日邦交正常化的方针，并且表示要根据这个方针鞭策鸠山内阁。
