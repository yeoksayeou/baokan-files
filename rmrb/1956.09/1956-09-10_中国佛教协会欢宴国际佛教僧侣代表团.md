Xinhua News Agency, 9th. The China Buddhist Association hosted a banquet at noon today to welcome the International Buddhist Monks Delegation composed of eleven high monks from seven countries including India.
    Zhang Ce, Deputy Secretary-General of the State Council, He Chengxiang, Director of the Bureau of Religious Affairs of the State Council, Wu La Mao, the Burmese Ambassador to China, Ra. Ku. Nehru, the Indian Ambassador to China, Yang An, the head of the Cambodian Economic Delegation, and more than sixty people from the Chinese Buddhist community attended the banquet.
    Mr. Zhao Puchu, Vice President of the China Buddhist Association, spoke at the banquet. He welcomed the masters who had come from afar on behalf of Chinese Buddhists. Zhao Puchu said that the spread of Buddhism and the exchanges of Buddhists have mutually disseminated the fruits of labor and wisdom of Asian nations in astronomy, medicine, music, painting, sculpture, architecture, printing, and other fields, thereby enriching the cultures of all nations and playing a significant role in the cultural exchanges of Asian countries. This is something that Buddhists can be proud of. Zhao Puchu also said that the outstanding representatives of monks from seven countries have come to China together for the first time in more than two thousand years of history. The Chinese Buddhist community sees the arrival of the International Buddhist Monks Delegation as a glorious page in the history of Buddhist relations between China and Asian countries. Zhao Puchu firmly believes that the noble purpose and skillful work of the delegation will bring great benefits to the cause of Buddhism, and at the same time will greatly encourage Buddhists and people of all countries to cooperate for peace and friendship.
　　The head of the delegation, Badanta Ananda Kossalyayana, pointed out in his speech that although only eleven bhikkhus from seven Asian countries have come to China this time, they have broad representation. He firmly believes that the eternal and solid friendly relations not only between China and India, but also between Asian countries, will be developed.
    At 10:00 this morning, the International Buddhist Monks Delegation visited the China Buddhist Association at Guangji Temple. When they arrived, the bell and drums of the Great Buddha Hall of Guangji Temple sounded in unison, and the monks stood solemnly in front of the hall in their cassocks to welcome them. These foreign high monks, accompanied by Venerable Neng Hai, Vice President of the China Buddhist Association, Mr. Zhao Puchu, and Venerable Dabei, Abbot of Guangji Temple, entered the Great Buddha Hall to offer flowers and pay homage to the Buddha, chanting a section of the auspicious sutra in Pali in front of the Buddha. Afterwards, they went to the Buddha statue in the Sarira Pagoda to offer flowers and admired the golden pagoda enshrining the Buddha's teeth and sarira.

　　代表团团长巴丹达·阿难陀·柯萨尔雅雅那在他的讲话中指出，这次来到中国的虽然只有来有亚洲七个国家的十一位比丘，但是具有广泛的代表性。他深信不仅是中印两国之间、而且亚洲各国之间的永恒的巩固的友好关系将要得到发展。
    今天上午10时，国际佛教僧侣代表团到广济寺访问了中国佛教协会。当他们到达的时候，广济寺大雄宝殿钟鼓齐鸣，僧众身披袈裟肃立殿前迎接。这些外国高僧由中国佛教协会副会长能海法师、赵朴初居士、广济寺住持大悲法师陪同进入大雄宝殿内供花礼佛，佛前用巴利文诵了一段吉祥经。随后，他们又到舍利阁的佛像前供花，瞻仰了供奉佛牙和舍利的金塔。
