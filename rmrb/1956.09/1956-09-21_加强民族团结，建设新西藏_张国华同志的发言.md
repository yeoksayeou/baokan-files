I completely agree with Comrade Liu Shaoqi’s political report, Comrade Zhou Enlai’s report on the proposal for the Second Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy, and Comrade Deng Xiaoping’s report on the revision of the Party Constitution.

I would now like to express some opinions on the work in Tibet.

Tibet was peacefully liberated in 1951 when the Tibetan local government and the Central People's Government signed the "Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet." From that time on, the Tibetan people were forever freed from the shackles of imperialism and returned to the big family of all ethnic groups of the motherland. The mainland of the motherland achieved unification, and our national defense was guaranteed. This is a major event of epoch-making significance in the history of the Tibetan people and the history of national relations of the motherland.

After the peaceful liberation of Tibet, the major tasks facing the Party and the Tibetan people are: to strengthen the unity between the Tibetan and Han nationalities and the unity within the Tibetan nationality; to consolidate the unification of the motherland; to gradually implement the agreement and achieve national regional autonomy; to develop Tibet's economy and culture; and to transition to a socialist society together with all fraternal nationalities.

The Tibetan area covers an area of approximately 1.52 million square kilometers with a population of approximately 1.2 million, the vast majority of whom are Tibetan. The Tibetan people are devout believers in Lamaism, and there are more than 100,000 lamas in the region. Religion has a significant influence on people's lives and political affairs. The socio-economic form of Tibet is still a feudal serf system, production technology is backward, and the working people live in extreme poverty. As a result of imperialist aggression and the national oppression policies adopted by successive ruling classes, the gap between the Tibetan and Han nationalities is very deep. Therefore, the Party must adhere to the principle of "steady progress" in carrying out all work in Tibet, and must adopt methods and approaches suitable to the actual conditions in the Tibetan region. The achievements of the past six years have strengthened the unity of the Tibetan nationality with all nationalities of the motherland; resolved historical disputes and pending issues within Tibet; developed financial, economic and trade, cultural and educational, and health work; and established the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region.

Over the past six years, under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee, we have done some work in Tibet. First, we have carried out anti-imperialist and patriotic united front work in all aspects, extensively carried out patriotic propaganda and education work, and strengthened the unity between the Tibetan nationality and all nationalities of the motherland, and the unity within the Tibetan nationality, which has played a great role in the political situation and the progress of various tasks in Tibet.

In the longer period before liberation, Tibet was not united internally. The Party believes that if this state of disunity continues, it will be very detrimental to the progress and development of the Tibetan nationality. Since liberation, the Party has helped all parties in Tibet, based on the principles of "mutual respect, mutual trust, mutual understanding, and mutual concession," and through consultation and mediation, resolved historical disputes and pending issues between them, improved relations, and enhanced unity.

In terms of finance, economics, and trade, the Central Government once determined the policy of the troops and personnel entering Tibet to be self-sufficient in production and to help Tibet with construction. Over the past six years, troops and office staff have actively participated in agricultural production and established agricultural experimental farms and military reclamation farms. This has not only solved many difficulties in the supply of grain and vegetables for the troops and office staff entering Tibet, but more importantly, it has played a demonstrative role in the agricultural production of the Tibetan people. In order to prosper the market economy and promote trade, under the principle of taking care of the needs of the people and making private merchants profitable, on the one hand, a large amount of foreign exchange is supplied, contracts are signed with merchants, import sources are organized, and export trade is encouraged. On the other hand, local specialties are purchased at fair and reasonable prices, and a large amount of domestic goods are transported from the mainland and sold at low prices by subsidizing freight rates to meet the needs of the people. In particular, more than 20 million catties of tea, which is essential for the lives of the Tibetan people, have been transported in the past six years, which is twice the normal annual amount before liberation. In order to solve the difficulties in production and life of the working people, interest-free agricultural and pastoral loans and low-interest handicraft loans have been issued many times. With the strong help of the people of the whole country and the cooperation of the people of all strata in Tibet, the Kangzang Highway and the Qingzang Highway, which were difficult projects, were completed by the end of 1954. Subsequently, the highways between several important cities in Tibet were also completed one after another. This closely linked the major towns in Tibet with the mainland of the motherland, laying a favorable foundation for helping the Tibetan region develop its politics, economy, and culture.

There has also been some development in Tibetan cultural, educational, and health work. In the past, there were no primary schools in Tibet, but now there are 31 primary schools in the region. In some cities, medical institutions with modern equipment have been established one after another. Medical and health work has been warmly welcomed and supported by the broad masses of the people.

Due to the unity of the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni, and the improvement of the patriotic consciousness of the people of all strata in Tibet, as well as the influence of the policy of national regional autonomy implemented by all fraternal nationalities, the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region was established in April this year on the basis of national unity and progress. This is an extremely important step for the Tibetan people in building their own happy lives in the big family of the motherland, and marks another great achievement of our Party's nationality policy.

Under the leadership of the Central Government, the work in Tibet has been successful; but for the needs of the Tibetan people, the work we have done is still very little. In the early days of liberation, the People's Liberation Army troops entering Tibet and the personnel entering Tibet purchased some daily necessities and hired yaks for transportation, and failed to adjust prices in time, which caused some losses to the people for a short period of time. In the past six years, the work of training Tibetan cadres has progressed relatively slowly. In working with national public leaders, there has been insufficient consultation on certain issues. There are still shortcomings in other work. The tasks in the future are to continue to strengthen the unity within the Tibetan nationality; vigorously train Tibetan cadres; steadily implement social reforms; implement the policy of freedom of religious belief and protection of religion; and carry out various constructions in a planned manner.
After the establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, the work in Tibet entered a new stage. Our work is to continue to strengthen national unity, consolidate and expand the anti-imperialist patriotic united front, vigorously train ethnic cadres, develop Party members and League members, realize regional autonomy, develop economic and cultural undertakings, reduce the burden on the people, improve the people's livelihood, and gradually democratize the autonomous organs, so as to prepare conditions for social reform.

(1) In order to fully realize the regional autonomy of Tibet and carry out economic and cultural construction, it is necessary to continue to strengthen the unity within the Tibetan nationality. The principle of unity advocated by the Party is to oppose imperialism and love the motherland. All those who support this principle, regardless of nationality, class, or belief, should unite closely, form an anti-imperialist patriotic united front, and strive to build the motherland and build a new Tibet. In the united front, we must adhere to the policy of long-term cooperation with the upper-class figures, and help them carry out self-education in the cooperation, and gradually become useful talents for the construction of Tibet. For the very few people who still adopt a non-patriotic attitude, we hope that they can realize their mistakes as soon as possible and return to the embrace of the people of the motherland. With the progress of the work of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, the Tibetan local government, the Panchen Kanpo Conference Hall Committee, and the Qamdo District People's Liberation Committee will gradually unite, and the relations between the three parties will be improved day by day, but all parties must continue to promote the spirit of mutual assistance and love in various tasks and strive to establish a unified Tibet Autonomous Region as soon as possible.

(2) In the process of implementing national regional autonomy, training cadres is a fundamental issue with key significance. Without a sufficient number of Tibetan cadres with a certain level of political awareness and working ability, all work will encounter insurmountable difficulties. In the past six years, Tibetan monks, secular officials, and cadres have made certain or even great progress, and more than 2,100 new Tibetan cadres have been trained; but the number of cadres and the speed of growth are still far behind the needs of the current work, and the work of building the Party is also not done enough. In order to enable Tibetan cadres to grow up quickly, Tibet will establish cadre schools and training courses this year, and plans to enroll 5,000 to 8,000 Tibetan students and train 10,000 cadres in rotation in the next four years, and train 3,000 various intermediate technical and business personnel from among them. In addition, a large number of students will be organized to study at the Central Institute for Nationalities and the Southwest and Northwest Institutes for Nationalities. With the development of the work of the Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region, a large number of Tibetan cadres should be absorbed and trained in organs at all levels throughout the region, and some Tibetan cadres with both ability and political integrity should be boldly promoted to responsible positions. Tibetan workers must be absorbed in transportation, industry, mining, water conservancy, medical treatment, trade and other undertakings or enterprises, and management cadres and specialized technical personnel should be trained from them.

(3) The issue of social reform has now become a matter of general concern for all strata in Tibet. At the founding meeting of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, the Dalai Lama and Panchen Erdeni expressed their support for reform, and the meeting adopted a positive attitude towards reform, which is correct. But this does not mean that social reform in Tibet will be carried out immediately, because there are several necessary conditions for reform in Tibet. These conditions are: (1) the working people have a demand for reform, and the upper classes sincerely support reform; (2) there is a reform method based on a scientific investigation of the social and economic conditions of Tibet and jointly discussed with representatives of all strata; (3) there are a certain number of ethnic cadres. At present, these conditions are obviously not fully met. Therefore, the start of reform will still need to be after a relatively long period of time.

When considering the issue of social reform in Tibet, we must pay attention to the special circumstances of Tibet. The guidelines, steps, and methods of reform should be different from those in the Han areas and other ethnic minority areas. The issue of reform must be seriously and repeatedly negotiated with the upper classes, so that the vast majority of the upper classes truly support and sponsor the reform, and a specific method that satisfies all classes and all parties is agreed upon before it is implemented. When the reform has not yet obtained the true agreement of the majority of the upper classes, it should not be forced to be done. Because forcing reform will inevitably affect the unity within and between nationalities, which will be detrimental to the smooth implementation of peaceful reform. Before the reform, the government should try to make appropriate arrangements for the work positions of all upper-class figures under the principle of ensuring that the political status and living standards of the upper-class figures are not reduced. In the consultation, if necessary, we should also persuade the masses of the people to make appropriate concessions in the timing, steps, and methods of reform, so as to win the approval of the upper classes for social reform and give up exploitation. In the past few years, we have handled many important issues by consulting with the upper-class figures in all aspects of Tibet and striving for the cooperation of the upper-class figures. Experience has proved that this policy of consultation is beneficial to national unity and the progress and development of the Tibetan nationality.

The reason why the Party advocates taking care of the interests of the upper classes during and after the reform is based on the actual situation in Tibet. The upper-class figures in Tibet have close ties with the broad masses of the people, and at the same time, they have made great contributions to the cause of national unity and the progress and unity of Tibet in the past few years. In this process, they themselves have also made varying degrees of progress. The people of all nationalities in the country will never obliterate their achievements. As long as they are willing to accept democratic reform and socialist transformation, there is no reason not to unite and cooperate with them or not to take care of their interests on the road to socialism. Appropriately taking care of the interests of the upper classes is not harming the interests of the working people. On the contrary, it is precisely because of taking care of the interests of the upper classes that the upper classes can sponsor the reform and educate them to serve the working people, which is conducive to the implementation of social reform. Taking care of the upper classes in this way is completely in line with the current and long-term interests of the working people.

On the other hand, the upper-class figures must also realize that only through reform can the Tibetan nationality have broad prospects for development, and only after individuals give up exploitation can they wholeheartedly serve the people and enjoy the happy life of socialism together with the working people. Therefore, we hope that the upper-class figures should actively study and strive for progress in the future, take the initiative to assume the responsibility of reform, and strive to complete the task of reform together with the working people.

(4) Lamaism has historically played a positive role in maintaining and uniting the Tibetan nationality and in preserving and disseminating Tibetan culture, and has a profound influence on people of all strata. We have taken a very cautious attitude towards religious issues in all our work. In the future, we will continue to implement the policy of freedom of religious belief and protection of religion, and strengthen the work of uniting the religious community. In order to promote the unity within the Tibetan religious community and arrange conditions for the religious community to study, the Tibet Branch of the Buddhist Association will be established this year, and a scripture academy will be established in Lhasa in the next two years to absorb lamas to enroll. We will give work opportunities to religious figures who are willing to work. When social reforms are carried out in the future and after the reforms, lama temples should be taken care of, and appropriate solutions should be given to the difficulties in the lives of lamas. We believe that protecting religion does not hinder the construction of socialism in Tibet; adopting a policy of protecting religion is precisely for the purpose of smoothly building socialism. As for the reform matters within the religious community, they should be negotiated and carried out by the religious figures themselves, and we will never interfere.

(5) In order to enable the Tibetan people to gradually transition to a socialist society, it is also necessary to carry out various constructions in a planned manner. We plan to continue to build roads, expand the investigation and research of Tibetan resources, develop agricultural, pastoral, and handicraft production, and establish some industries and water conservancy projects in the next few years to meet the needs of the people. In this regard, in addition to relying on the efforts of the Tibetan people themselves, the help of the working class and intellectuals of all fraternal nationalities is also needed, which is an indispensable condition for Tibet to transition from beyond the capitalist stage to socialism.

### 加强民族团结，建设新西藏  张国华同志的发言

专栏：

    加强民族团结，建设新西藏
    张国华同志的发言
    我完全同意刘少奇同志的政治报告、周恩来同志关于发展国民经济第二个五年计划建议的报告和邓小平同志关于修改党的章程的报告。
    我现在就西藏地方的工作问题发表一些意见。
    西藏地方是在一九五一年西藏地方政府和中央人民政府签订了“关于和平解放西藏办法的协议”而获得和平解放的。从那时起，西藏民族永远摆脱了帝国主义的束缚，回到祖国各民族大家庭里来，祖国的大陆实现了统一，我国的国防得到了保障，这在西藏民族的历史上和祖国民族关系的历史上都是具有划时代意义的重大事件。
    在西藏和平解放之后，摆在党和西藏人民面前的重大任务是：加强藏汉民族间的团结和西藏民族内部的团结，巩固祖国的统一，逐步实现协议和实现民族区域自治，发展西藏的经济和文化，与各兄弟民族一道过渡到社会主义社会。
    西藏地方面积约有一百五十二万平方公里，人口约有一百二十万，其中绝大多数是藏族。藏族人民笃信喇嘛教，全区约有喇嘛十余万，宗教在人民生活中和政治事务上都有重大的影响。西藏的社会经济形态仍是封建农奴制，生产技术落后，劳动人民生活非常贫困。由于帝国主义的侵略和历代统治阶级采取民族压迫政策的结果，藏、汉民族间的隔阂很深。因此，党在西藏进行一切工作，必须坚持“稳步前进”的方针，必须采取适合西藏地区实际情况的方式、方法。六年来的成就加强了西藏民族同祖国各民族的团结；解决了西藏内部的历史纠纷和悬案；发展了财经贸易和文教卫生工作；成立了西藏自治区筹备委员会。
    六年来，在党中央正确的领导下，我们在西藏做了一些工作。首先从各个方面开展了反帝爱国统一战线工作，广泛地进行了爱国主义的宣传教育工作，加强了西藏民族与祖国各民族之间的团结和西藏民族内部的团结，这对于西藏政治局势和各项工作的进展，起了很大的作用。
    在解放前的较长时期内，西藏内部是不团结的。党认为，如果这种不团结状态存在下去，对于西藏民族进步和发展是很不利的。解放以来，党帮助西藏各方面本着“互相尊重、互相信任、互相谅解、互相让步”的原则，经过协商调解，解决了彼此间的历史纠纷和悬案问题，改善了关系，增强了团结。
    在财经贸易方面，中央曾经确定了进藏部队和工作人员生产自给和帮助西藏进行建设的方针。六年来，部队和机关工作人员积极参加农业生产，兴办了农业试验场和军垦农场，这不但对进藏部队和工作人员粮食蔬菜供应方面解决不少困难，而且更重要的是对西藏人民农业生产起了示范作用。在繁荣市场经济、促进贸易方面，在照顾人民的需要并使私商有利可图的原则下，一方面供给大量外汇，和商人订立合同，组织进口货源，鼓励出口贸易，另方面，用公平合理价格，收购土特产品，并从内地运入大量国货，用贴补运价的办法，廉价批售，以供应人民的需要。特别是西藏人民生活必需的茶叶，六年来共运进两千多万斤，比解放前常年进量增加了两倍。为了解决劳动人民生产和生活上的困难，先后多次发放了无利农业、牧业贷款和低利的手工业贷款。在全国人民的大力帮助下，在西藏各阶层人民的合作下，一九五四年底修成了工程艰巨的康藏公路、青藏公路。随后，西藏几个重要城市间的公路也相继修通。这就使西藏地区各主要城镇和祖国内地紧密地联系在一起，为帮助西藏地方发展政治、经济、文化奠定了有利的条件。
    西藏文教、卫生工作，也有一些发展，过去西藏没有小学，现在全区有小学三十一所。在一些城市中，具有现代化设备的医疗机构已经先后建立起来。医疗卫生工作得到广大人民热烈的欢迎和拥护。
    由于达赖和班禅两位领导人物的团结和西藏各阶层人民的爱国主义觉悟的提高，同时也由于各兄弟民族实施民族区域自治政策的影响，今年四月，在民族团结进步的基础上，成立了西藏自治区筹备委员会。这是西藏人民在祖国大家庭中建设自己幸福生活的一个极为重要的步骤，标志着我党的民族政策又一伟大的成就。
    在中央的领导下，西藏地方的工作是有成绩的；但是对于西藏人民的需要来说，我们做的工作还是很少的。在解放初期，人民解放军入藏部队和入藏工作人员在当地采购一部分生活必需品和雇用牦牛运输，未能及时地调整价格，曾经在一个短时期内使人民群众受到了一些损失。六年来，培养藏族干部工作进展得比较缓慢，同民族公众领袖共事中，在某些问题上，还协商得不够。其他工作上的缺点还是有的。今后的任务继续加强西藏民族内部的团结；大力培养藏族干部；稳步实行社会改革；执行宗教信仰自由和保护宗教的政策；有计划地进行各项建设。
    在西藏自治区筹备委员会成立后，西藏工作就进入了一个新的阶段。我们的工作是继续加强民族团结，巩固扩大反帝爱国统一战线，大力培养民族干部，发展党员团员，实现区域自治，发展经济、文化事业，减轻人民负担，改善人民生活和逐步做到自治机关民主化，为社会改革准备条件。
    （一）为了完满地实现西藏区域自治和进行经济、文化建设，必须继续加强西藏民族内部的团结。党所主张的团结的原则是反对帝国主义、爱护祖国。凡是拥护这一原则的人，不分民族、不分阶层、不分信仰，都应该紧密地团结起来，结成一条反帝爱国统一战线，为建设祖国建设新西藏而努力。在统一战线中，我们对于上层人士要坚持长期合作的方针，并在合作中帮助他们进行自我教育，逐渐成为建设西藏的有用的人材。对于极少数仍然采取非爱国主义态度的人们，则希望他们能够及早觉悟，回到祖国人民的怀抱中来。随着西藏自治区筹备委员会工作的进展，西藏地方政府、班禅堪布会议厅委员会、昌都地区人民解放委员会必将逐渐统一起来，三方面关系必将日益改善，但是各方面仍要在各项工作中发扬互助友爱的精神，努力争取早日建立统一的西藏自治区。
    （二）在实施民族区域自治的进程中，培养干部是一个带有关键性的根本问题。如果没有足够数量的具有一定政治水平和工作能力的藏族干部，一切工作都将遇到难以克服的困难。六年来，西藏的僧俗官员干部，都有了一定的甚至很大的进步，同时又培养了二千一百多名新的藏族干部；但是干部的数量和成长的速度还是远远落后于当前工作的需要的，建党工作方面也是做得不够的。为了使藏族干部迅速成长起来，西藏今年将成立干部学校和训练班，计划在今后四年内招收藏族学员五千至八千人，轮训干部一万人，并从其中培养出各种中级技术、业务人员三千人。此外，还要组织大批学员，到中央民族学院和西南、西北民族学院学习。随着自治区筹备委员会工作的开展，在全区各级机关中要大量地吸收和培养藏族干部，把一些德才兼备的藏族干部放手提拔到负责岗位上来。在交通、工矿、水利、医疗、贸易等事业或企业中必须吸收藏族职工，从中培养管理干部和专门技术人才。
    （三）社会改革问题在目前已经成为西藏各阶层普遍关心的问题，在西藏自治区筹备委员会成立大会上，达赖喇嘛、班禅额尔德尼都表示拥护改革，会议对于改革采取了肯定态度，这是正确的。但是这还不等于说西藏的社会改革马上就要进行了，因为在西藏进行改革必须具备若干必要的条件，这些条件就是：（1）劳动人民有了改革的要求，上层人士真心拥护改革；（2）有一个基于对西藏社会经济状况的科学的调查并和各阶层代表人士共同商定的改革办法；（3）有一定数量的民族干部。目前，这些条件显然还不是完全具备了的。因此，改革的开始还需在一个较长时间之后。
    在考虑西藏的社会改革问题的时候，必须注意西藏的特殊情况。改革的方针、步骤和办法，应该和汉族地区以及其他少数民族地区都有所不同。改革问题必须经过和上层人士认真地反复地协商，作到上层绝大多数真正拥护和赞助改革，并且商定一个各阶层各方面都满意的具体办法，然后去实行。当改革还没有取得大多数上层人士真正同意的时候，不可勉强去做。因为勉强进行改革，势必影响民族内部和民族间的团结关系，反而不利于和平改革的顺利进行。在改革前，政府应在保证上层人士的政治地位和生活水平都不降低的原则下，设法把所有上层人士的工作职务都作出适当的安排。在协商中，必要时，我们还应该说服人民群众在改革的时机、步骤和方法上作适当的让步，以便争取上层人士赞同社会改革，放弃剥削。几年来在许多关系重大的问题上，我们都是和西藏各方面上层人士协商、争取上层人士合作来办理的。经验证明，这种协商办事的方针，对于民族团结和西藏民族的进步和发展是有利的。
    党所以主张在改革之中和改革之后照顾上层的利益，是从西藏的实际情况出发的，西藏的上层人士和广大人民有着密切的联系，同时，几年来他们对于祖国统一和西藏团结进步的事业作了很大的贡献。在这中间他们自身也都有了不同程度的进步，全国各族人民绝不抹杀他们的功绩，只要他们愿意接受民主改革和社会主义改造，在向社会主义前进的道路上，就没有理由不和他们团结合作或者不照顾他们的利益。适当地照顾上层的利益，并不是损害劳动人民的利益，相反地正是由于照顾了上层的利益，才能够使上层赞助改革，才能够教育他们为劳动人民服务，因而就有利于社会改革的实施。这样照顾上层是完全符合劳动人民的目前利益和长远利益的。
    在另一方面上层人士也必须认识到只有经过改革，西藏民族才有广阔的发展前途，个人放弃剥削后，才能够全心全意地为人民服务，才能够和劳动人民一起享受社会主义的幸福生活。因此，我们希望上层人士今后应该积极学习，力求进步，主动负起改革的责任，争取和劳动人民一起完成改革的任务。
    （四）喇嘛教在历史上对于西藏民族的维系和团结，对于西藏文化的保持和传播，曾经起过积极的作用，在各阶层人民中有深厚的影响。我们在一切工作中对待宗教问题采取了十分慎重的态度。今后，我们仍然继续执行宗教信仰自由和保护宗教的政策，加强对宗教界的团结工作。为了促进西藏宗教界内部的团结和安排宗教界学习的条件，今年将成立佛教协会西藏分会，并计划在今明两年内，在拉萨成立一所经学院，吸收喇嘛入学。对于愿意担任工作的宗教界人士，我们将给予工作的机会。在将来进行社会改革的时候和改革以后，对于喇嘛寺庙要给予照顾，喇嘛的生活如有困难，给予适当的解决。我们认为，保护宗教是不妨碍西藏建设社会主义事业的；采取保护宗教的政策，正是为了顺利地建设社会主义，至于宗教界内部的改革事宜，则应由宗教界人士自己协商进行，我们绝不干涉。
    （五）为了使西藏人民逐步过渡到社会主义社会，还必须有计划地进行各种建设，我们计划在今后几年内继续修筑公路，扩大西藏富源的调查研究，发展农、牧、手工业生产，兴办一些工业、水利，解决人民的需要。在这一方面，除了必须依靠西藏人民自己的努力以外，还需要各兄弟民族的工人阶级和知识界的帮助，这是使西藏超越资本主义阶段过渡到社会主义所不可缺少的条件。
