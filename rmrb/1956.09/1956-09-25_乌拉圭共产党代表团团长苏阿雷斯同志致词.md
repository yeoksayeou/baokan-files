Comrades!

	On behalf of the Communist Party of Uruguay, we extend fraternal greetings to the glorious Chinese Communist Party and its wise Central Committee.

	We belong to the Latin American continent under the rule of American imperialism, where the people's struggle for national liberation is constantly growing.

	Therefore, we attach great importance to the existence of the People's Republic of China and the great victories you have achieved in socialist construction.

	After the October Revolution, the greatest event in history was your liberation revolution. The October Revolution gave birth to the great and beloved Soviet Union—the teacher, fortress, and hope of all peoples—ensuring the victory of the world significance of Marxism-Leninism and strengthening the confidence that socialism will inevitably triumph throughout the world. And the Chinese revolution has finally and definitively placed the cause of liberation of all peoples in an advantageous position.

	The workers and people of Uruguay attach great importance to your contribution to the cause of peace and friendship among all peoples. Recently, the people of Uruguay warmly welcomed the excellent artists of the Chinese Art Troupe. They are the embodiment of your outstanding art, and all workers, working masses, and broad sections of society regard them as messengers of peace and fraternal friendship, and pay tribute to them.

	Currently, trade unions and people from all walks of life in our country are working hard to ensure that the proposal made by the President of the People's Bank of China to the Uruguayan Republic Bank to conclude a bilateral exchange agreement is adopted. As your Comrade Zhou Enlai mentioned to a Uruguayan government representative, trade exchanges between China and Uruguay will thus be opened up. This is how the workers and people of Uruguay express their desire to strengthen the friendly relations between our two peoples.

	Comrades!

	The working class and working masses of Uruguay are engaged in some major struggles. They are striving to build a social force capable of liberating Uruguay from the dual shackles of imperialism and feudalism, which is the national liberation democratic front with the worker-peasant alliance as its core. It unites broad social strata around it, and whether the national bourgeoisie will participate will depend on its struggle.

	The unification of workers' trade unions is moving forward in this sense.

	At the same time, our people are striving to create more favorable conditions for the struggle for peace, national independence, and democratic freedom. The new international situation makes patriotic unity possible, especially conducive to pursuing an independent foreign policy based on the Bandung Conference and the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence between China and India, and subject to national interests. These interests are: opposing imperialist monopoly capitalists, especially American monopoly capitalists and their agents, implementing free trade, protecting industry, animal husbandry, agriculture, and defending the current and future interests of our people.

	Through these struggles, patriotic forces, especially workers and peasants, clearly understand the selfless and tireless actions of our party in striving for the national and social liberation of the Republic.

	This is an important result of the Party's Sixteenth Congress, which made healthy self-critical revisions to our strategic and tactical guidelines and eliminated harmful phenomena in the life of the Party, all of which paved the way for us to achieve significant accomplishments.

	Our firmly united party is expanding its ties with the worker-peasant masses in all aspects, striving to raise the ideological level of its ranks; the party is growing stronger and striving to strengthen party organizations in factories and rural areas.

	The great contribution of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has ideologically consolidated the Party. Contrary to what some people think, the peace camp headed by the Soviet Union is more united today than ever before. Your Congress has given us new and rich experiences, and has shown us the splendid beauty of the new China. We will do our best to introduce all of this in detail to our people.

	I wish your Congress complete success!

	Long live the Chinese people who are building socialism under the leadership of the wise and courageous leader, the glorious Chinese Communist Party!

### 乌拉圭共产党代表团团长苏阿雷斯同志致词

    乌拉圭共产党代表团团长苏阿雷斯同志致词同志们：
    我们以乌拉圭共产党的名义向光荣的中国共产党及其英明的中央委员会致以兄弟般的敬礼。
    我们属于在美帝国主义统治之下的拉丁美洲大陆的一个小国家，在这大陆上，人民争取民族解放的斗争正在不断增长。
    因此，我们对中华人民共和国存在的重要性以及你们在社会主义建设中取得的伟大胜利极为重视。
    十月革命以后，历史上最伟大的事件就是你们的解放革命。十月革命诞生了伟大的、亲爱的苏联——各国人民的导师、堡垒和希望——，保证了马克思列宁主义的世界意义的胜利，坚定了社会主义必然将在全世界获得胜利的信心。而中国革命终于肯定地使各国人民的解放事业处于有利的地位。
    乌拉圭的劳动者和人民很重视你们对各国人民的和平和友好事业所作的贡献。最近，乌拉圭人民热烈地欢迎了中国艺术团的优秀的艺术家。他们是你们卓越的艺术的体现者，所有的工人、劳动群众和广大的社会人士都把他们看作和平和兄弟般的友谊的使者，向他们致敬。
    目前，我国的工会和各界人士正在努力，使中国人民银行行长向乌拉圭共和国银行提出的缔结两国兑换协定的建议得到采纳。你们的周恩来同志向一位乌拉圭政府代表提到过的中乌两国贸易往来将因此得以打开道路。乌拉圭的劳动者和人民就是这样来表示他们希望加强我们两国人民的友好关系的愿望的。
    同志们：
    乌拉圭的工人阶级和劳动群众正在进行一些重大的斗争。他们正在努力建立一支能把乌拉圭从帝国主义和封建主义的双重桎梏下解放出来的社会力量，这就是以工农联盟为核心的民族解放民主阵线。它把广大的社会各阶层团结在它的周围，而民族资产阶级的是否参加也将取决于它的斗争。
    劳动者的工会的统一就在这个意义上向前迈进。
    同时我国人民在努力为争取和平、民族独立和民主自由的斗争创造更有利的条件。新的国际形势使爱国的团结成为可能，尤其有利于奉行一个独立的外交政策，这个外交政策是以万隆会议和中印两国五项原则为依据，并且服从于民族的利益，这些利益就是：反对帝国主义垄断资本家，特别是美国的垄断资本家及其代理人，实行自由贸易，保护工业、畜牧业、农业并保卫我国人民目前和将来的利益。
    通过这些斗争，爱国力量，尤其是工人和农民清楚地了解到了我们党为争取共和国的民族和社会解放所作的忘我的不倦的行动。
    这是党第十六次代表大会的重要结果，这次大会对我们的战略和战术的方针作了健康的自我批评的修正，并消除了党的生活中的有害现象，这一切为我们取得重大成就开辟了道路。
    牢固地团结着的我们的党正在从各方面扩大它同工农群众的联系，努力提高它的队伍的思想水平；党日益壮大并为加强工厂和农村中党的组织而奋斗。
    苏联共产党第二十次代表大会的伟大贡献在思想上巩固了党。与某些人所想的恰恰相反，以苏联为首的和平阵营今天比任何时候都更加团结了。你们的大会给了我们新的和丰富的经验，给我们看见了新中国的灿烂的美景。我们将尽力把这一切详细地介绍给我国人民。
    祝你们大会的工作获得完满的成功！
    在英明勇敢的领导者，光荣的中国共产党领导下的正在建设着社会主义的中国人民万岁！（附图片）
