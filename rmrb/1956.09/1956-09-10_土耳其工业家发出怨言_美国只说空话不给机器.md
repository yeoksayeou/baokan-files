Xinhua News Agency, Istanbul, September 8th (TASS): The Turkish newspaper "Yeni Istanbul" reported on the meeting between a U.S. business delegation operating in Turkey and Turkish ore exporters.

    Turkish businessmen and industrialists told the Americans that while Turkey was extremely short of funds needed to exploit iron, lead and other minerals, the U.S. had frozen for three or four years the payments Turkey should have received for exporting chrome ore.

    One Turkish industrialist, speaking about "U.S. Aid" to Turkey, said: "This should not be called aid. If you really want us to prosper, then you should stop making empty promises and give us machines."

    The U.S. delegation members replied that Turkey should ensure it obtains the foreign exchange necessary to purchase machines by expanding its exports to the United States.

    土耳其工业家发出怨言
    美国只说空话不给机器
    新华社9日讯　塔斯社伊斯坦布尔8日讯：土耳其“新时报”报道了在土耳其活动的美国商务代表团同土耳其矿砂出口商的会谈情况。
    土耳其商人和工业家对美国人说，正当土耳其异常缺乏开采铁、铅和其他矿藏所必需的资金的时候，美国却把土耳其输出铬矿砂所应获得的货款冻结了三、四年。
    一个土耳其工业家谈到给土耳其的“美援”时说：“这不应当叫做援助。要是真正希望我们繁荣，那就应当停止说空话，给我们机器。”
    美国代表团团员们对这一点的答复是，土耳其应当用扩大对美国的输出来保证取得购买机器所必需的外汇。
