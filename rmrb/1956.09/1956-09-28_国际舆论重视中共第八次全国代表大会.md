Xinhua News Agency, September 27th: In recent days, newspapers in the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries have continued to devote significant space to publishing documents and news about the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China. The progress of the Eighth National Congress of the CPC has been closely watched by the broad masses of people.

Soviet newspapers "Pravda," "Izvestia," and other central-level newspapers have been publishing news and speeches from the Eighth National Congress of the CPC for several consecutive days. Moscow Radio has also broadcast special programs organized by its reporters on the Eighth National Congress of the CPC.

The news and documents related to the Eighth National Congress of the CPC, published daily in newspapers, have become the focus of attention for the Soviet people. According to reports, several thousand propagandists have been sent to the masses to promote these materials. In many factories, collective farms, institutions, and schools across the country, symposiums and discussions on the Eighth National Congress of the CPC have been held in recent days. Enterprises, farms, and institutions in Moscow and other places have also organized readings of the materials from the Congress. Some universities, libraries, and cultural institutions in Frunze, Minsk, Vilnius, and other places have held photo and book exhibitions introducing the glorious struggle path of the Communist Party of China. Workers in factories accepting Chinese orders are enthusiastically striving to complete the production of these orders ahead of schedule.

Newspapers in East European people's democratic countries have also continued to devote significant space to publishing news and important speeches from the Eighth National Congress of the CPC.

The Czechoslovakian newspaper "People's Front" published an editorial on the 23rd, stating that the documents of the Eighth National Congress of the CPC tell us how the builders of new China successfully utilized the experience of the Soviet Union and how they sought new forms and created new experiences based on Leninism. The Chinese are humble, and they spoke very modestly even at this congress. They are very self-critical.

Newspapers in North Korea, Mongolia, and Vietnam have also successively reported on the progress of the Eighth National Congress of the CPC and published some of the representatives' speeches at the meeting.
Brother Parties' Newspapers Publish Congress News for Days

Xinhua News Agency, September 27th: Newspapers of the Communist and Workers' Parties in European and American capitalist countries have been publishing news about the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China for several consecutive days.

The French newspaper "l'Humanité" has been reporting on the opening of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China since September 15th, and has published excerpts from Comrade Mao Zedong's opening speech, the political report by Comrade Liu Shaoqi, the report by Comrade Deng Xiaoping on the revision of the Party Constitution, and the report by Comrade Zhou Enlai on the Second Five-Year Plan.

The Italian newspaper "l'Unità" has attached great importance to the news and reports from the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, and has provided relatively detailed reports every day.

In addition to publishing news about the Party Congress, the American "Daily Worker" also published the full text of Comrade Mao Zedong's opening speech.

The British "Daily Worker" has also been continuously publishing reports on the Eighth National Congress of the CPC.

The Canadian "Tribune" reported on the news of the Party Congress and published photos of the leaders of the Communist Party of China.

The "Austrian People's Voice" has been publishing comprehensive reports on the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China for several days, and has published excerpts from Comrade Mao Zedong's opening speech, as well as reports made by Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, and Deng Xiaoping at the meeting.
Asian and African Opinion Believes the Congress Has Great Significance

Xinhua News Agency, September 27th: Public opinion in Asian and African countries generally attaches importance to the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China.

They believe that this congress is of great significance and pay particular attention to the various documents published at the congress regarding how the Communist Party of China led the Chinese people to get rid of the backwardness caused by imperialism, as well as the experiences and lessons China has gained in its construction.

Indian newspapers have generally published news about Comrade Mao Zedong's opening speech at the congress, the political report made by Comrade Liu Shaoqi, and the report by Comrade Zhou Enlai on the proposal for the Second Five-Year Plan. Many newspapers have also published editorials and commentaries. The Nagpur "Nagpur Times" editorial on September 21st said that the Eighth National Congress of the CPC is an event of great significance. The editorial mentioned the speeches at the congress about greatly increasing national income and said that India and China both face the huge problem of how to improve the living standards of the masses while having huge manpower. Although India and China are different in ideology and the methods of the two countries are different, the two countries can learn from each other's experiences for mutual benefit.

The "Free Press Journal" editorial on September 19th said that Zhou Enlai's report clearly shows that the foundation for large-scale rapid industrialization has been laid. It pointed out the increase in the proportion of the state-owned economy in China's industrial production and the achievements of agricultural cooperation, and said, "It is not surprising that China has great confidence in the future."

The "Times of India" said in its editorial published on September 21st that the point mentioned in Liu Shaoqi's report that China is willing to use peaceful negotiations to bring Taiwan back to the embrace of the motherland is "most welcome".

The "Japan Times" said in its editorial on September 19th that Japan not only has great interest in China's economic development, but also has great interest in its political development. It believes that from mainland China, one can see trends such as the consolidation of the new Chinese regime, the continued close cooperation between China and the Soviet Union, and the unwavering efforts to make China an industrial power as soon as possible.

The Tokyo "Yomiuri Shimbun" said, "The long-term plan to coexist with non-Communist groups is obviously a realistic method for the Communist Party of China to solve the huge tasks it faces."

The Yangon "Burma Times" said in its editorial on September 18th that, judging from the achievements made by the Chinese Communists in the past few years, the plan proposed by Zhou Enlai is optimistic. The editorial said, "We are not defending communism, but it must be admitted that after driving the Kuomintang out of mainland China, China was fortunate to find a government that it very much needed that could provide stability and high efficiency."

Egyptian newspapers also generally published news about the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China. They all published a passage in Comrade Mao Zedong's opening speech on September 16th, in a prominent position, about supporting Egypt's position on the Suez Canal issue.
Western Newspapers Acknowledge Our Country's Unity and Strength

Xinhua News Agency, September 27th: The progress of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China has attracted close attention from newspapers and news agencies in Western countries. They have continuously published news and commentaries on the congress.

On the first day of the meeting, September 15th, the influential American newspaper "The Christian Science Monitor" published an article pointing out that the Communist Party of China is the largest national communist organization in the world, and that the party has come a long way in thirty-five years. The current Eighth National Congress reflects "tremendous power and great confidence". "The party is slowly, but quite surely, leading agricultural China towards industrialization". "Whether acknowledged or not, the Communist Party of China has made China a major world power."

A commentary in the Paris "Le Monde" on the 17th pointed out: "This congress seems destined to be a significant day in the history of world communism, especially in Chinese history."

Many newspapers acknowledged that one of the most important features of this congress is the party's unity, confidence, and strength. The American "Christian Science Monitor" pointed out in a telegram titled "Party Holds Congress; Beijing Shows Rock-Solid Front" that, up to now, the speeches of the Communist Party leaders have mostly expressed a high degree of confidence. The report published by the "New York Herald Tribune" also reluctantly admitted that "the speeches delivered at the Congress chillingly remind people of the growing strength of Communist China."

The British "Sunday Times," in commenting on Mao Zedong's opening speech and Liu Shaoqi's political report, also acknowledged that the atmosphere of the Beijing Congress "is full of confidence, joy, optimism and unity. This is understandable, and any unbiased observer will admit this."

Zhou Enlai's report on the proposal for the Second Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy is one of the focal points of Western newspapers' commentaries. The "Washington Post" said on the 22nd that Zhou Enlai's report put forward "a series of impressive statistics," and "there is no good reason to underestimate the progress or capabilities of this country (China) in the economic field."

An editorial in the British "Manchester Guardian" said, "There is increasing evidence of the stability and considerable achievements of the Communist government. The speed of industrial development has exceeded what many believed possible. Although it is only limited to certain areas, and the development is inconsistent throughout the country, it is already remarkable to do so. The number of students in colleges and universities has doubled compared to twelve years ago, and the curriculum is not so narrow. All of this adds up to a remarkable achievement."

Western newspapers also attached great importance to the speeches of the representatives of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and other fraternal parties at the meeting, and tried to sow discord in Sino-Soviet relations. However, some Western newspapers, such as the "New York Herald Tribune," could not help but admit that the strong Sino-Soviet alliance had not weakened in any way as they had hoped.

At the same time, as one might expect, some bourgeois newspapers have made unfounded distortions and slanders of the reports and speeches at the congress.

    国际舆论重视中共第八次全国代表大会
    兄弟国家报纸详细报道大会情况
    据新华社27日讯　最近几天来，苏联和各人民民主国家的报纸继续以大量篇幅刊载中国共产党第八次全国代表大会的文件和消息。中共八大的进展情况一直受到广大人民群众的注意。
    苏联“真理报”、“消息报”和其它中央一级报纸连日来都在刊登中共八大的会议消息和发言。莫斯科广播电台也播送了它的记者所组织的有关中共八大的特别节目。
    报纸上每天发表的有关中共八大的消息和文件成了苏联人民注意的中心。据报道，已经有几千个宣传鼓动员到群众中去宣传这些材料。在各地的许多工厂、集体农庄、机关和学校中，这几天都举行了有关中共八大的座谈会和讨论会。莫斯科和其他一些地方的企业、农庄和机关还对代表大会的材料组织了阅读。伏龙芝、明斯克、维尔纽斯等地的一些高等学校、图书馆和文化机关还举行了图片和书籍展览会，介绍中国共产党的光荣的斗争道路。接受中国订货的工厂的职工们正在热情地争取提前完成生产这些订货的任务。

    新华社27日讯　亚非各国的舆论普遍重视中国共产党第八次全国代表大会。
    它们认为这次大会具有重大意义，并且特别注意大会上发表的各种文件中有关中国共产党领导中国人民如何摆脱帝国主义所造成的落后状态，以及中国在建设中取得的经验和教训。
    印度报纸普遍刊载了有关毛泽东同志在大会上的开幕词，刘少奇同志所作的政治报告和周恩来同志所作的关于第二个五年计划的建议的报告的消息，许多报纸并且发表了社论和评论。那格浦尔“箴言报”9月21日的社论说，中共第八次全国代表大会是一个具有重大意义的事件。社论提到大会上关于将大大提高国民收入的发言时说，印度和中国都面临着在拥有巨大人力的情况下如何提高群众生活水平的巨大问题。虽然印度和中国在意识形态上是不同的，两国的方法也不相同，但是两国能够吸取彼此的经验以便共同得到好处。
    “自由新闻”9月19日的社论说，周恩来的报告明白地表明：大规模的迅速的工业化的基础已经打好了。它在指出中国工业生产中的国营经济比重增加和农业合作化的成绩后说，“中国对将来怀着极大的信心，这是毫不足怪的”。
    “印度时报”在9月21日发表的社论说，刘少奇的报告中提到中国愿意用和平谈判的方式使台湾重新回到祖国怀抱这一点是“最受人欢迎的”。
    “日本时报”9月19日的社论说，日本不仅对中国的经济发展怀有巨大的兴趣，而且对它的政治发展也怀有巨大的兴趣。它认为，从中国大陆可以看到新中国政权已经巩固，中国同苏联将继续密切合作，将不遗余力地使中国尽早成为工业大国等趋势。

    仰光“缅甸人报”9月18日的社论说，从过去几年中国共产党人所获得的成绩来看，周恩来所提出的计划是可以乐观的。社论说，“我们并不是为共产主义辩护，但是必须承认，在把国民党赶出中国大陆之后，中国幸而找到了一个它非常需要的能够给予稳定和效率高的政府”。
    埃及各报也普遍刊载了有关中共第八次全国代表大会的消息。它们在9月16日都以显著地位刊载了毛泽东同志开幕词中关于支持埃及在苏伊士运河问题上的立场的一段话。
    西方报纸承认我国团结和强盛
    新华社27日讯　中国共产党第八次全国代表大会的进程引起西方国家的报纸和通讯社密切的重视。它们连续发表了有关大会的消息和评论。
    在9月15日会议举行的第一天，美国有影响的报纸“基督教科学箴言报”就刊载一篇文章指出，中国共产党是世界上最大的全国性共产主义组织，这个党在三十五年中走过了很长的路程。目前举行的第八次代表大会反映了“巨大的权力和极大的信心”。“这个党正在缓慢地、但却是相当有把握地领导着把农业的中国推向工业化”。“不管承认与否，中国共产党已经使中国成为世界一大强国”。
    巴黎“世界报”17日的评论指出：“这次代表大会似乎将成为世界共产主义历史上、特别是中国历史上有意义的日子。”
    许多报纸承认，在这个大会上，最重要的特征之一是党的团结、信心和力量。美国“基督教科学箴言报”在一条题为“党举行代表大会；北京表现出磐石般巩固的阵线”的电讯中指出，直到眼前为止，共产党领导人的发言中大都表示了高度的信心。“纽约先驱论坛报”刊载的报道也不怀好意地承认，“代表大会上发表的演说令人心寒地使人意识到共产党中国日益增长的力量。”
    英国的“星期日泰晤士报”在评论毛泽东的开幕词和刘少奇的政治报告时也承认，北京代表大会的气氛“是充满了信心、喜悦、乐观和团结的。这是能够理解的，任何不抱偏见的观察家都将承认这一点。”
    周恩来关于发展国民经济的第二个五年计划的建议的报告是西方国家报纸的评论中心之一。“华盛顿邮报”22日说，周恩来的报告提出了“一连串给人深刻印象的统计数字”，“人们并没有正当理由在经济方面低估这个国家（中国）的进展或能力。”
    英国的“曼彻斯特卫报”的社论说，“有愈来愈多的迹象证明共产党政府的稳固和相当大的成就。工业发展的速度超过了许多人所相信的可能性。虽然只是限于某些地区，而且全国各地发展是不一致的，做到这样已经是了不起的了。学院和大学学生的人数比十二年前增加了一倍，课程内容也不是那样偏狭了。所有这一切加在一起，造成了一种显著的成绩。”
    西方国家报纸也十分重视苏联共产党和其他各兄弟党的代表在会上的发言，并且力图挑拨中苏关系。但是，某些西方报刊，例如“纽约先驱论坛报”也不能不承认，强固的中苏同盟并没有像他们所妄想那样有任何削弱。
    同时，也正如人们所预料到的那样，一些资产阶级报纸对代表大会上的报告和发言进行了毫无根据的歪曲和诬蔑。
