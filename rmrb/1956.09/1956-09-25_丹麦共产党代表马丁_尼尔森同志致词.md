Dear Comrades,

    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of Denmark sincerely thanks the Chinese Communist Party for inviting it to participate in this Congress. The work of this Congress signifies an acceleration of the cause of peace, and at the same time signifies a major step forward for the Chinese people in realizing their great tasks on the road to socialism. We ask you to regard our congratulations as also being to the great Chinese people who have consistently, bravely, and victoriously struggled for their own independence, freedom, and peace, and for the independence, freedom, and peace of all peoples of the world.

    Our country is located at the entrance from the Atlantic Ocean to the Baltic Sea. Due to this geographical position, Western imperialists are attempting to include Denmark in their aggression plans. And our country has joined the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty Organization without the consent of the people.

    For Denmark, this is a complete violation of our traditional policy of neutrality. The broad masses of the people are increasingly firmly opposed to this practice, and have achieved significant results. For example, apart from the bases in the Arctic region of Greenland, some plans that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization meticulously prepared to establish American military bases on Danish soil have been continuously thwarted.

    One of the reasons why the people oppose the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's policy is the danger of the increasing revival of German militarism. For a hundred years, German militarists have attempted to destroy our country three times.

    The peace policies of the Soviet Union, People's China, and other socialist countries have a profound influence on Denmark. People from all walks of life are satisfied with the friendly visit of the Danish Social Democratic Prime Minister to the Soviet Union this year, and the results have proven that this visit is of great significance to our country.

    For several years, delegations representing all walks of life have visited China, and they returned filled with praise for the ancient culture of the Chinese people and for their efforts to build a socialist future.

    The Communist Party of Denmark is not a large party, but it plays a huge political role in decisive situations. This was the case during the Nazi occupation of Denmark from 1940 to 1945. The united action formed in the anti-fascist resistance struggle was divided by the leaders of the Social Democratic Party, which has been the traditional party of the workers for more than eighty years. Now, with the increasing relaxation of international tensions, under the influence of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and with the increasing opposition of workers to the political and economic consequences of militarization, the workers in our country are once again uniting more and more rapidly. This spring, the majority of the working class held demonstrations against the employers and against the government that supported the employers. These demonstrations took the form of illegal national strikes and public gatherings, the scale of which was unprecedented in Danish history. These strikes and demonstrations showed that the working class accepted the Communist Party's political line.

    Our major problem is to develop and temper this spirit of unity in the Danish labor movement. We believe that our party, enriched by the theory and practice of the world communist movement, can solve the problem of worker unity.

    We once again congratulate the glorious Chinese Communist Party and the great Chinese people, who are one of the most decisive forces in modern history in the struggle for peace, democracy, and socialism.

    Long live the glorious Chinese Communist Party! (Attached picture)

### 丹麦共产党代表马丁·尼尔森同志致词

    丹麦共产党代表马丁·尼尔森同志致词亲爱的同志们：
    丹麦共产党中央委员会真诚地感谢中国共产党邀请它来参加这次代表大会。这次大会的工作意味着和平事业的加速推进，同时意味着中国人民在社会主义道路上实现巨大的任务中迈进了重要的一步。我们请求你们把我们的祝贺也当作对为了自己和全世界各国人民的独立、自由与和平而一贯勇敢地、胜利地进行斗争的伟大中国人民的祝贺。
    我们的国家位置在从大西洋进入波罗的海的入口处。由于这种地理上的位置，西方的帝国主义者企图把丹麦列入他们的侵略计划中。而我们的国家在没有取得人民同意的情况下就参加了侵略性的北大西洋公约组织。
    对丹麦说来，这是完全违背我们传统的中立政策的。广大的人民群众日益坚决地反对这种做法，并且取得了重大的成绩。例如，除了在格陵兰的北极地带的基地以外，北大西洋公约组织为了在丹麦的土地上建立美国军事基地而作了周密准备的一些计划不断地遭到破产。
    人民反对北大西洋公约组织的政策，其原因之一是德国军国主义日益复活的危险。一百年来，德国军国主义者曾经三次企图消灭我们的国家。
    苏联、人民中国和其他社会主义国家的和平政策对丹麦有极深的影响。对于丹麦社会民主党首相今年到苏联进行的友好访问，社会各阶层都感到满意，结果证明这次访问对我国具有重大的意义。
    几年来代表着各阶层的代表团访问了中国，他们充满了对中国人民的古老文化和为建设社会主义的未来而作的努力的赞扬回去了。
    丹麦共产党不是一个大党，但它在具有决定性的局势中却起着巨大的政治作用。在1940—1945年纳粹占领丹麦的时期，就是这样。在反法西斯的抵抗斗争中所形成的统一行动，却被八十多年来一直是工人的传统政党的社会民主党的领袖所分裂。现在，在国际紧张局势日益缓和的情况下，在苏联共产党第二十次代表大会的影响下，在工人日益反对军事化的政治与经济后果的情况下，我国工人们再次越来越迅速地团结起来了。今年春天，工人阶级的大多数人举行了示威，反对雇主和反对支持雇主的政府。这次示威采取了非法的全国性罢工和公共集会的方式，规模之大在丹麦历史上是空前的。这些罢工和示威表明工人阶级接受了共产党的政治路线。
    我们的重大问题是在丹麦的劳工运动中发展和锻炼这种团结的精神。我们相信，为世界共产主义运动的理论与实践所丰富了的我们的党，能够解决工人统一的问题。
    我们再一次祝贺光荣的中国共产党和伟大的中国人民，他们是现代历史上为和平、民主和社会主义而斗争的最具有决定作用的力量之一。
    光荣的中国共产党万岁！（附图片）
