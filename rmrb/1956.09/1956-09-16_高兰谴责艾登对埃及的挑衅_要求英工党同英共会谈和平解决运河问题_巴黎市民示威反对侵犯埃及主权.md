Xinhua News Agency, September 15th dispatch: TASS, London, September 15th: The British "Daily Worker" published an article by John Gollan, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Great Britain, concerning the Suez Canal issue. The article pointed out that Prime Minister Eden's speech in the House of Commons on September 12 showed that the British government "has not abandoned its policy of strength on the Suez Canal issue."

Gollan pointed out that the military preparations made by the British and French governments were provocative, and he demanded a negotiated solution to the Suez Canal issue.

Gollan concluded by saying that the Executive Committee of the Communist Party of Great Britain recommends to the National Executive Committee of the Labour Party that representatives of the two parties hold talks to discuss what measures should be taken to achieve a peaceful solution to the Suez Canal issue.

Xinhua News Agency, September 15th dispatch: TASS, Paris: Three thousand citizens of Paris, responding to the call of the French Communist Party, held a mass meeting on the evening of the 13th at the "Mutual Aid Hall" on the Suez Canal issue.

Marcel Servin, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party, delivered a speech in which he emphasized that the Suez Canal was built by the Egyptian people themselves. The Egyptian government's nationalization of it is in accordance with international law. He condemned the Western countries' policy on the Suez issue.

Servin pointed out that the plan to establish a "Suez Canal Users Association" is a provocation and unacceptable to Egypt because it is an affront to Egypt's national dignity and infringes upon its sovereignty.

The meeting then unanimously adopted a resolution supporting the policy elaborated by the representatives of the French Communist Party.

The resolution stated that the Egyptian government has the full right to nationalize the Suez Canal, an indivisible part of Egyptian territory. At the same time, the various guarantees offered by the Egyptian government regarding freedom of navigation on the canal can be accepted by Western countries as a basis for negotiations.

The resolution strongly condemned the threat of the use of force and other measures that could lead to military adventures, believing that the consequences of such military adventures would endanger peace in France and the world.

At the same time, the leading body of the French Peace Movement also issued a statement condemning the British and French governments' policy of playing with fire. The statement advocated resolving the Suez issue through negotiations based on the principles of the United Nations Charter and the legitimate interests of both parties.

    据新华社15日讯　塔斯社伦敦15日讯：英国“工人日报”刊载了英国共产党总书记高兰写的一篇关于苏彝士运河问题的文章。这篇文章指出，艾登首相9月12日在下院发表的演说表明，英国政府“在苏彝士运河问题上没有放弃实力政策”。
    高兰指出英法两国政府所进行的军事准备是有挑衅性的，他要求通过谈判方式来解决苏彝士运河问题。
    高兰最后说，英国共产党执行委员会建议工党全国执行委员会：由两党代表进行会谈，讨论应当采取什么措施来使苏彝士运河问题得到和平解决。
    据新华社15日讯　据塔斯社巴黎讯：巴黎三千市民响应法国共产党的号召，13日晚间在“互助大厅”就苏彝士运河问题举行群众大会。
    共产党中央委员会政治局委员马赛尔·赛尔文发表演说，他强调指出，苏彝士运河是埃及人亲手建成的。埃及政府把它收归国有，是符合国际法准则的。他谴责西方国家对苏彝士问题的政策。
    赛尔文指出，成立“运河使用国协会”的计划是一种挑衅，是埃及所不能接受的，因为这个计划有辱埃及的民族尊严，并且侵犯了它的主权。
    接着大会一致通过了一项决议，拥护法国共产党代表所阐明的政策。
    决议说，埃及政府完全有权把埃及领土不可分割的组成部分苏彝士运河收归国有。同时，埃及政府对运河航行自由提出的各种保证，可以为西方国家接受作为谈判基础。
    决议坚决谴责使用武力威胁和其他足以导致军事冒险的措施，认为这种军事冒险的后果将会危害法国和全世界和平。
    同时法国和平运动领导机构也发表了声明，谴责英法两国的玩火政策。声明主张根据联合国宪章原则和双方合法利益进行谈判，解决苏彝士问题。
