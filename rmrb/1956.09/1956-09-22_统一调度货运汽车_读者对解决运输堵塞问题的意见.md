    Unified Dispatch of Freight Trucks
    -- Readers' Opinions on Solving Transportation Congestion

    Several Measures in Shijiazhuang

    Since March, Shijiazhuang's transportation volume has increased unprecedentedly, with a monthly shortage of vehicles. However, the utilization rate of freight trucks owned by Shijiazhuang's government offices, enterprises, schools, and other units (the total number of which is more than three times the number of freight trucks controlled by the Shijiazhuang transportation department) is very low, with some utilization rates reaching only one-half, and some units not even reaching one-half.

    In response to the above situation, in order to solve the current transportation congestion problem, the Shijiazhuang Municipal People's Committee adopted a method of unified dispatch and use of freight trucks from various units, which has achieved quite good results. The specific practices of the Shijiazhuang Municipal People's Committee are:

    First, for units with relatively large transportation tasks, the transportation department conducts detailed accounting and fixes the transportation tasks, which are completed by the unit's own transportation tools. The First Construction and Installation Engineering Company of the Ministry of Textile Industry has twenty-two trucks, and their efficiency was very low in the past, with an average attendance rate of only about 70%. After fixing the tasks, they improved their systems, brought into play their transportation efficiency, and reached the quota. The Municipal People's Committee also transferred some drivers to help them organize day and night shifts, so that the Shijiazhuang No. 4 Cotton Textile Factory project undertaken by this engineering company avoided work stoppages due to lack of materials.

    Second, for units whose tasks and transportation capacity are basically balanced, but have potential to be tapped, after verification, they are required to improve efficiency and draw a portion of the trucks to support transportation for other units. Initially, some units did not agree, one being that they did not think there was any potential to be tapped, and the other being that they were afraid of affecting their own transportation tasks. The Shijiazhuang Municipal People's Committee did sufficient mobilization work and stipulated that after completing the unit's own tasks, if they could support one day, they would support one day, and if they could support one trip, they would support one trip. In this way, the concerns of these units were dispelled. Many units, after completing their own tasks, requested to support transportation within the city. For example, after completing its own transportation tasks of cotton yarn and cotton cloth, the Shijiazhuang Textile Factory continuously supported the transportation of other units within the city, achieving the goal of completing its own transportation tasks and supporting transportation within the city without any hindrance.

    Third, for units with small tasks and very low vehicle utilization rates, the vehicles are temporarily withdrawn entirely and uniformly dispatched by the transportation department. In the dispatch, real attention is paid to completing the tasks of the units that provide the vehicles. For example, after the trucks of the Shijiazhuang Workers' Junior Middle School were withdrawn, when the school needed vehicles, it notified the transportation department in advance. The transportation department made plans to have the trucks return to the school half an hour before they were needed, and immediately return to the transportation department for transportation after use.

    Fourth, flexibly allocate transportation capacity. The transportation distances for units in Shijiazhuang are generally short, and some transportation tasks are not suitable for truck transportation; although some transportation distances are long, trucks cannot travel there. Therefore, although some units have their own trucks, they are actually idle and cannot be used. After unified dispatch, this problem was also solved. For example, the No. 1 Engineering Department of the Construction Company of the Ministry of Light Industry is a unit with a relatively large number of trucks, but because the projects undertaken by the unit have railway sidings, the various materials arriving only need to be moved within the factory, and trucks are very inconvenient. In this way, they handed over the task of moving within the factory to the transportation department, which allocated some rickshaws and horse-drawn carts to solve the problem, and their trucks were transferred to support transportation within the city.　Li Shisheng

    Many Benefits of Participating in Unified Transportation

    Our No. 1 Engineering Department of the Railway Ministry's Construction Factory Company has fifty-eight trucks. Due to the imbalance in the materials used in the project, most of the vehicles are idle at home every year from December to May of the following year, especially in the first quarter, when the phenomenon of idle vehicles and idle work is even more serious, with an average of less than ten vehicles operating per day.

    Since March 21, 1955, when our department signed an agreement with the Beijing Transportation Company to participate in the unified transportation of Beijing's government offices, for more than a year, not only has the phenomenon of idle vehicles and idle work been eliminated, reversing the resulting losses, but it has also supported Beijing's transportation work.

    At present, the shortage of transportation capacity and the tense transportation tasks in Beijing are well known. In order to build the capital more beautifully, enable basic construction projects to be carried out according to plan, enable factories to produce according to plan, and enable people's daily necessities to be supplied in a timely manner, it is hoped that the persons in charge of various units with freight trucks will carefully consider helping Beijing solve the difficulty of insufficient transportation capacity, which is also beneficial to the economic accounting of the unit.　Xiao Maosen

### 统一调度货运汽车——读者对解决运输堵塞问题的意见

    统一调度货运汽车
    ——读者对解决运输堵塞问题的意见
    石家庄市的几项办法
    石家庄市运输量从3月份起空前增大，月月缺车；而石家庄市机关、企业、学校等单位自有的货运汽车（总数相当石家庄运输部门所掌握的货运汽车的三倍多），利用率却很低，有的利用率只达二分之一，有的单位还达不到二分之一。
    针对上述情况，为了解决当前运输堵塞问题，石家庄市人民委员会对各单位的货运汽车，采取了统一调度和使用的办法，收到相当好的效果。石家庄市人民委员会的具体做法是：
    第一，运输任务比较大的单位，由运输部门详细进行核算后，固定运输任务，由本单位的运输工具去完成。纺织工业部第一建筑安装工程公司有二十二部货车，过去效率很低，出勤率平均只达70％左右，经过固定任务后，他们健全了制度，发挥了运输效率，达到了定额。市人民委员会还抽调了一部分司机，帮助他们组织了昼夜两班运行，使这个工程公司承建的石家庄棉纺四厂工程避免了停工待料。
    第二，本单位任务和运力基本平衡，但有潜力可挖的，经过核实后，要求提高效率，抽出一部分汽车，支援其他单位运输。起先，有些单位思想不通，一是认为没有什么潜力可挖，二是怕影响自己的运输任务。石家庄市人民委员会做了充分的动员工作，并规定完成了本单位任务后，能抽出一天就支援一天，能支援一趟就支援一趟。这样，就解除了这些单位的顾虑。有很多单位都在完成了自己的任务后，要求支援市内运输。如石家庄纺织厂完成了本单位的棉纱、棉布运输任务后，不断地支援市内其他单位的运输，做到了完成本厂运输任务和支援市内运输两不误。
    第三，本单位任务不大，车辆利用率很低的，暂时把车辆全部抽出，由运输部门统一调度，在调度中又切实注意完成出车单位的任务。如把石家庄职工初级中学的汽车抽走后，学校需要用车时，提前通知运输部门，运输部门做好计划，让汽车在用车半小时前返校，用完后立即返回运输部门进行运输。
    第四，机动地调配运力。石家庄市各单位的运输距离一般较短，有些运输任务不适合汽车运输；有些运输距离虽然较长，但汽车不能走。因此，有些单位自己虽然有汽车，实际上闲着不能用。经过统一调度后，这个问题也解决了。如轻工业部建筑公司第一工程处是汽车比较多的单位，但由于本单位施工的工程有铁路专用线，到达的各种物资只需在厂内搬运，汽车很不方便。这样，他们就将厂内搬运任务交由运输部门拨一部分人力车、马车解决，他们的汽车调出来支援市内运输。　李适生
    参加统一运输好处多
    我们铁道部建厂公司第一工程处有汽车五十八辆，由于工程用料不平衡，每年自12月到来年5月以前，车辆大部分在家窝着，尤其是第一季度窝车窝工现象更严重，每天平均出车不满十辆。
    自从1955年3月21日我处和北京市运输公司签订了机关汽车参加北京市统一运输的协议以后，一年多来不但消灭了窝车窝工现象，扭转了因此产生的亏累现象，而且支援了北京市的运输工作。
    目前，北京市运输力量不足、运输任务紧张的情况是人所共知的。为了把首都建设得更美丽，让基本建设工程能按计划施工，让工厂能按计划生产，让人民生活必需品能及时供应，希望有货运汽车的各个单位的负责人都很好地考虑一下，帮助北京市解决运力不足的困难，这也有利于本单位的经济核算。　肖茂森
