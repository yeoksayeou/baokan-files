Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, September 3rd: Mangunsarkoro, First Deputy Chairman of the Indonesian Nationalist Party, spoke to Antara News Agency on September 1st regarding the attempted arrest of the Foreign Minister by some military officers on August 13th.

	Mangunsarkoro said: "The August 13th incident was an action completely devoid of any legal basis, manipulated by those who merely sought to achieve some political objective. This is a political conspiracy that would cause the government and the nation's dignity to suffer losses."

	The Indonesian Nationalist Party leader said: "At a time when we are about to begin building a country ruled by law, it would be very dangerous if these elements are not dealt with."

	He expressed regret that military commanders were involved in this incident and demanded that the government prevent similar incidents from happening again.

	Dahlan, Chairman of the Indonesian Islamic Teachers Association, said on the same day that the public is waiting for the government to take further action. He believes that this incident should be resolved according to the law.

	According to today's report in the Indonesian "People's Daily," Aidit, General Secretary of the Indonesian Communist Party, welcomed the Cabinet's preparation for an impartial anti-corruption plan and hoped that the anti-corruption bill could be put forward quickly.

	Aidit demanded that the work of eliminating corruption should be carried out in accordance with the law. He said that the reason he emphasized the need to abide by the law was to prevent certain people from using the slogan of anti-corruption to take arbitrary actions in order to achieve their selfish goals.

    印度尼西亚重要政党领袖
    要求根据法律解决逮捕外交部长事件
    据新华社雅加达3日电　印度尼西亚国民党第一副主席曼贡萨科罗9月1日就8月13日发生的一些军官企图逮捕外交部长事件对安塔拉通讯社发表了谈话。
    曼贡萨科罗说：“八一三”事件是一种完全没有任何法律根据的行动，是由那些单是企图达到某种政治目的的人操纵的。这是会使政府和国家的尊严遭受损失的一次政治阴谋。
    这位印度尼西亚国民党领袖说：“在我们正要开始建立一个法治的国家的时候，如果对这些分子不加以处理，那会是非常危险的。”
    他对于有军事司令官参与这次事件表示遗憾，并且要求政府防止再发生类似的事件。
    印度尼西亚伊斯兰教师联合会主席达兰在同一天说，公众正在等待政府采取进一步的行动。他认为，这个事件应该根据法律来解决。
    据印度尼西亚“人民日报”今天报道，印度尼西亚共产党总书记艾地对于内阁准备进行大公无私的反贪污计划表示欢迎，并且希望反贪污法案能够迅速提出来。
    艾地要求消灭贪污的工作应当遵照法律来进行。他说，他之所以强调要遵照法律是为了防止某些人为了达到自己的自私目的而利用反贪污的口号来采取专横的行动。
