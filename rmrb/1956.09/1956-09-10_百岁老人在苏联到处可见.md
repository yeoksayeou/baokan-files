Centenarians Are Ubiquitous in the Soviet Union

The Soviet population is rapidly increasing, the mortality rate has greatly decreased, and centenarians can be seen everywhere. Soviet professor Bitscheraulin wrote in the "Soviet Union" Pictorial: In the past five years, the population increase in the Soviet Union is equivalent to the entire population of Denmark, Norway, Finland, and Switzerland combined. Compared with 1913, the population mortality rate has decreased by three and a half times.

He said: Soviet scientists recently discovered more than 12,300 elderly people over 100 years old just in the two republics of Georgia and Abkhazia. The Republic of Georgia has 10,300 centenarians, of which 35% are men and 65% are women. These elderly people are mentally healthy, and examinations have shown that many of them retain good eyesight, hearing, teeth, and normal cardiovascular and nervous systems.

The oldest of the elderly is Yegul Pikaevich Kaloev. He is already 155 years old. He was born in 1801, thirteen years earlier than the great Russian poet Lermontov. His wife, Taimari Vaimado, is also 125 years old.

In the Gudov region of the Abkhazian Republic lives 149-year-old Pisi Chaiba. Not long ago, he told children in the local elementary school about the tragic lives of farmers before the revolution. 138-year-old Mrs. Qie Qishaweier has very good eyesight and can still sew woolen clothes.

Many centenarians are folk singers. They know many extremely interesting folk tales and historical stories.

    百岁老人在苏联到处可见
    苏联人口迅速增加，死亡率大大缩小，百岁老人到处可以见到。苏联教授比茨歇拉乌林在“苏联”画报著文说：最近五年，苏联增加的人口相等于目前丹麦、挪威、芬兰、瑞士四国所有的人口。现在与1913年比较，人口死亡率减少了三倍半。
    他说：苏联科学家们最近仅在格鲁吉亚、阿布哈兹两个共和国内调查，就发现了一万二千三百多老人活过了一百岁。格鲁吉亚共和国有一万零三百个百岁以上的老人，其中35％是男人，65％是女人。这些老人们精神健康，经过检查证明：很多老人保存着很好的视力、听觉、牙齿，心脏与神经系统正常。
    老人中最老的是叶古尔·彼开维契·卡洛也夫。他已经一百五十五岁了。他生于1801年，比俄罗斯伟大诗人莱蒙托夫早生了十三年。他的妻子泰玛莉·瓦依玛朵也已经一百二十五岁了。
    在阿布哈兹共和国的古道夫区里住着一百四十九岁的老人彼西·柴巴，不久前，他在当地的小学里给孩子们讲述了革命前农民们的悲惨生活情形。一百三十八岁的老太太茄契莎维尔视力很好，她还能缝制毛料衣服。
    很多百岁以上的老人是民谣歌手。他们知道很多极有趣的民间传说与历史故事。
