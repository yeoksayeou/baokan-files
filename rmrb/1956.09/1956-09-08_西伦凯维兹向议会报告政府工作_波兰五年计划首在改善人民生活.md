Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, September 7th: Polish Premier Cyrankiewicz reported to the Parliament on September 5th on the government's work regarding pressing issues in the national economy, according to the Polish Press Agency.

Cyrankiewicz said that the growing role and prestige of the Parliament is one of the most important factors in the democratization process. The government is determined to do everything possible to provide the Parliament with favorable conditions in carrying out its duties. The main venue for legislative activity should be the Parliament. The government is striving to reduce the practice of issuing directives and allow the Parliament to discuss and issue them.

When mentioning the Six-Year Plan, Cyrankiewicz said that it laid the foundation for Poland's further development. However, imbalances in development emerged during the implementation of the plan. The task at hand is to eliminate these imbalances and correct mistakes. When drafting the Five-Year Plan, we took the most fundamental current need—raising the living standards of the working people—as our starting point. The other indicators of the Five-Year Plan are adapted to this need. As of September 1st, the wages of 3,259,000 employees have been adjusted, and their income will increase by 7,175 million zlotys (Polish currency) in a year.

Cyrankiewicz said that one of the most pressing issues in our lives is the housing problem. During the Five-Year Plan, in addition to building houses in rural areas, there are plans to build 1.2 million housing units. Another important issue is the supply of food and industrial goods. He said that the situation in this regard is still unsatisfactory. However, thanks to the over-fulfillment of the production plan for consumer goods industries, and the over-fulfillment of the procurement plan for agricultural products and the import plan for consumer goods, the work done in the first half of this year in raising living standards and adjusting wages was better than expected.

Cyrankiewicz finally spoke about the handling of the Poznań events. He said that so far, the investigation of the Poznań events has confirmed that the opinion of the Seventh Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party was correct. The investigation and trial of this incident will be conducted in accordance with the strictest requirements of the law and the rule of law. The trial will be open to the public.

Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, September 6th: The ninth session of the Polish Parliament opened in Warsaw on the afternoon of September 5th.

The agenda adopted by the meeting included: the report of the Chairman of the Council of Ministers on the work done by the government in terms of the urgent tasks of the national economy, the report of the Foreign Affairs Committee on the appeal of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union to the parliaments of all countries on the issue of disarmament, and issues such as the abolition of regulations on socialist labor discipline, placing prisons under the administration of the Ministry of Justice, and the establishment of a committee to consider amending the parliamentary election law.

### 西伦凯维兹向议会报告政府工作  波兰五年计划首在改善人民生活

    西伦凯维兹向议会报告政府工作
    波兰五年计划首在改善人民生活
    新华社华沙7日电　据波兰通讯社报道，波兰部长会议主席西伦凯维兹9月5日在议会会议上就政府在国民经济迫切问题方面所做的工作作了报告。
    西伦凯维兹说，议会的日益增长的作用和威信是民主化过程中最重要的因素之一。政府决心尽一切力量使议会在执行它的职责时得到便利的条件。立法活动的主要场所应该是议会，政府正在力求减少颁布指令的作法，以便由议会来讨论和发布指令。
    西伦凯维兹在提到六年计划的时候说，六年计划为波兰的进一步发展奠定了基础。但是，在执行计划的期间出现了发展不平衡的现象。面临的任务就是消除这种不平衡状态和纠正错误。在草拟五年计划的时候，我们就是把当前最根本的需要——提高劳动人民的生活水平——作为它的出发点。五年计划的其他指标都是适应这个需要的。到9月1日为止，已经有三百二十五万九千职工的工资得到了调整，他们的收入在一年中将增加七十一亿七千五百万兹罗提（波币名）。
    西伦凯维兹说，我们生活中最迫切的问题之一是住宅问题。在五年计划期间，除了在乡村中建筑住宅之外，还计划建筑一百二十万间住房。另一个重要问题是食品和工业品的供应问题。他说，这方面的情况仍然是不能令人满意的。但是，由于消费品工业超额完成生产计划，由于农产品采购计划和消费品进口计划超额完成，今年上半年在提高生活水平和调整工资方面所做的工作比预定的好。
    西伦凯维兹最后谈到了波兹南事件的处理情况。他说，到目前为止，对波兹南事件的调查已经证实波兰统一工人党中央委员会第七次全体会议的意见是正确的。这个事件的调查和审讯将根据法律和法制的最严格的要求进行。审讯将公开进行。
    据新华社华沙6日电　波兰议会第九次会议9月5日下午在华沙开幕。
    会议通过的议程包括：部长会议主席关于政府在国民经济迫切任务方面所做的工作的报告，外交委员会关于苏联最高苏维埃就裁军问题向各国议会发出的呼吁书的报告，关于取消社会主义劳动纪律法规、把监狱交由司法部管理，以及设立考虑修改议会选举法的委员会等问题。
