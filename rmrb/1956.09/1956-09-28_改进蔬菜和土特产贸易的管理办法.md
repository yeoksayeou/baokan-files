Speech by Song Kanfu, First Secretary of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

There is an urgent need to eliminate overly strict and rigid restrictions in market management to promote the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas and to ensure the interests of consumers and producers.

I fully agree with Comrade Liu Shaoqi's political report. Comrade Shaoqi pointed out in regards to commerce: "We should improve the current market management methods, eliminate overly strict and rigid restrictions; and we should allow the existence and a certain degree of development of free markets under state leadership within a certain range of the unified socialist market as a supplement to the state market." I believe that doing so fully conforms to the requirements of socialist economic development. From the perspective of Wuhan's vegetable supply, there is an urgent need to eliminate overly strict and rigid restrictions. Due to the excessive emphasis on centralized vegetable trading and the implementation of unified purchase and sales by state-owned vegetable companies, many unnecessary circulation links have been added, resulting in slow turnover, large losses, and high costs. Residents cannot buy fresh vegetables, but only stale vegetables that have been stored for at least a day or two, and large quantities of vegetables often rot. To change this situation, we have changed the unified vegetable purchasing service stations into trading markets; state-owned vegetable companies still purchase a dozen major vegetables from vegetable cooperatives according to contracts (not all unified purchases) to ensure supply and stabilize vegetable prices; for other non-major products, producers and consumers are allowed to buy and sell directly and freely. In addition to free buying and selling in state-led vegetable markets, vendors are also allowed to sell door-to-door in the streets to facilitate residents.

Regarding vegetable prices, there is also an excessive emphasis on uniformity, without paying attention to using price policies to regulate supply and demand and guide production. In the past, private vegetable businesses not only had seasonal price differences and quality price differences, but also morning and evening price differences within a day. In the past, old and tender vegetables could be chosen freely, with large price differences. We have turned it into rigid matching, with uniform prices. We sell stale vegetables first and then fresh vegetables, and fresh vegetables become stale vegetables before they are sold. Consumers say this is "promoting the stale to store the new." In the past, the price difference between newly listed fresh vegetables and vegetables when they are available in large quantities was very large, but we have reduced it a lot. As a result, vegetable farmers wait for the vegetables to grow old and large before selling them, and are unwilling to sell tender vegetables; therefore, although some vegetable cooperatives have increased vegetable production by 30 percent compared with last year, their monetary income has decreased instead. This is obviously unreasonable. This overly rigid price is inseparable from the overly rigid market management methods. In the future, regarding vegetable prices, we should, according to different seasons, select several major varieties and negotiate wholesale and retail prices for medium-quality vegetables. Then, each vegetable market and retail store can flexibly adjust prices within a certain range according to the different quality and supply and demand of various vegetables. Only in this way can we better take into account the interests of producers and consumers.

In recent years, there has been a serious imbalance in Wuhan's vegetable supply, with shortages and surpluses occurring from time to time. This requires close cooperation between urban commercial departments and suburban work departments to guide vegetable cooperatives to plan the production of vegetables in each quarter according to the needs of residents, in order to overcome the phenomenon of production and sales being out of sync.

In terms of native produce trade, there are also cases of overly strict and rigid restrictions. Regardless of whether it is a major or minor commodity, unified management is forced, and the source of goods, prices, and funds are all controlled by the higher authorities "from top to bottom." Originally, production and sales could be directly transacted, or small vendors could buy directly, but now they have to be transferred by the supply and marketing cooperatives at each level. For example, some chemical raw materials are purchased by the grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives, transferred to Wuhan City through several channels, handed over to the state-owned chemical company, and then sold to chemical plants. Between the transfers, several handling fees are added, and profits are added at each level, resulting in excessively large purchase and sales price differences. The price difference rate is generally 30 percent, and individual varieties reach 50 percent. Also, due to the emphasis on unified purchasing, farmers cannot enter the city to sell scattered native produce. Some products are out of stock in the city, but the farmers cannot sell the things in their hands, which seriously affects the living needs of urban people and the raw material needs of local industries and handicrafts, as well as the production enthusiasm of farmers. Our preliminary research suggests that, in addition to the major native products purchased by the state plan, we should open up free transactions of minor native products between regions; allow farmers or grassroots cooperatives to sell freely in the market; and restore the native product trading market (which can also be reorganized into rural service departments), adopting the method of direct meetings between producers and sellers, signing contracts, or free transactions, to reduce circulation links, reduce costs, and narrow the purchase and sales price difference. Make the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas smooth.

### 改进蔬菜和土特产贸易的管理办法

    改进蔬菜和土特产贸易的管理办法
    中共武汉市委员会第一书记　宋侃夫同志的发言
    迫切需要取消市场管理方面过严过死的限制，以便促进城乡物资交流，保证消费者、生产者的利益。
    我完全同意刘少奇同志的政治报告，少奇同志在商业问题上这样指出：“我们应当改进现行的市场管理办法，取消过严过死的限制；并且应当在统一的社会主义市场的一定范围内，允许国家领导下的自由市场的存在和一定程度的发展，作为国家市场的补充”。我认为这样做完全符合于社会主义经济发展的要求。从武汉市蔬菜的供应工作来看，就迫切需要取消过严过死的限制。由于过分强调了蔬菜要集中交易，由国营蔬菜公司实行统购包销，增加了许多不必要的周转环节，因而形成了周转慢、损耗大、费用高的状况。居民买不到鲜嫩蔬菜，买到的是最少是存了一两天的陈菜，并且常有大批蔬菜霉烂。为了改变这种状况，我们已经把统一收购蔬菜的服务站改变为交易市场；国营蔬菜公司对于十几项大宗蔬菜仍然按照合同向蔬菜合作社进行收购（不是全部统购），以便保证供应，稳定菜价；对于其他非大宗产品则允许生产者和消费者直接买卖，自由成交，除了在国家领导的菜市场可以自由买卖以外，还允许菜贩串街上门零售，以便利居民。
    关于蔬菜的价格，也是过分强调了统一，没有注意运用价格政策以调节供求和指导生产。过去私人经营蔬菜，不但有季节差价、品质差价，一天当中还有早晚差价，过去是老菜嫩菜任人挑选，价钱差别很大，我们则变成硬性搭配，价钱一律。我们先卖陈菜后卖新菜，新菜变成了陈菜才卖，消费者说这是“推陈储新”。过去新上市的鲜嫩蔬菜与大量上市时的蔬菜价格差别很大，可是我们把它缩得很小，这样菜农则等待蔬菜长大长老，不肯卖出嫩菜；因而有些蔬菜合作社虽然蔬菜产量比去年增加了百分之三十，但是货币收入反而减少了。这样做显然是不合理的，这种统得过死的价格是与统得过死的市场管理办法分不开的。今后对于蔬菜的价格问题，我们应当根据不同的季节，选择若干主要品种，议定中等质量的批发价和零售价，然后由各个菜市场和零售店根据各种蔬菜的不同质量与供求情况，在一定幅度内，灵活地调整价格，只有这样才能更好地兼顾生产者与消费者的利益。
    几年来，武汉市在蔬菜供应上存在着有时脱销有时积压的严重的不均衡的情况，这就要求城市商业部门和郊区工作部门密切结合，根据居民的需要，指导蔬菜合作社有计划地安排各个季度蔬菜的生产，以克服产销脱节的现象。
    在土特产交易方面，也有限制过严过死的情形，不论大宗、小宗，强求统一经营，货源、价格、资金等都是由上面“一条鞭”管到底，原来产销可以直接成交或者通过小商贩可以直接买到的，现在要由供销社层层转手。如有些化工原料由供销社基层收购，经过几道转手到武汉市交给国营化工公司，再卖给化工厂，转手之间，增加几道手续费，层层加利润，造成购销差价过大，差价率一般达百分之三十，个别品种达到百分之五十。又由于强调统一收购，农民就不能进城出售零星土特产，有些产品城市脱销，而农民手中的东西却卖不掉，使城市人民的生活需要和地方工业、手工业的原料需要，农民的生产积极性，都受到严重影响。我们初步研究提出的意见是：除国家计划收购的大宗土特产以外，建议互相开放地区之间的小宗土特产的自由成交；允许农民或基层合作社在市场上自由出售；恢复土特产交易市场（也可改组为农村服务部），采取产销双方直接见面、订合同或自由成交的办法，以减少流转环节，减少费用，缩小购销差价。使城乡物资交流得到畅通。
