Comrade Kui Bi, Secretary of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China, speaks:

    I completely agree with the Political Report of the Central Committee of the Party, the Report on the Revision of the Party Constitution, and the Report on the Proposal for the Second Five-Year Plan. The line and various policies implemented by the Party Central Committee since the Seventh National Congress have been completely correct. I fully support them.

    The Party's work on minority nationalities is an indispensable component of the great cause of the Chinese revolution and the construction of the motherland. The achievements of the Party in the work concerning minority nationalities in the eleven years from the "Seventh National Congress" to the "Eighth National Congress" are, like the achievements in other undertakings, great. The achievements of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are a part of the glorious victory of the Party's nationalities policy.

    Great Changes in the Inner Mongolia Region

    For the past eleven years, the Party organizations in the Inner Mongolia region, under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee, have correctly implemented the Party's policy of national regional autonomy and other policies, united the people of all nationalities in the region, carried out the war of liberation, gradually promoted national regional autonomy, smoothly completed democratic reforms, achieved a decisive victory in the socialist revolution, and, after restoring and developing production, have further carried out socialist construction under the unified plan of the state, developed economic and cultural undertakings, and improved the material and cultural life of the people. Now, the Inner Mongolia nationality is uniting with all nationalities in the country to jointly build our great motherland, and is transitioning from a backward nationality to an advanced socialist nationality.

    Unified Regional Autonomy Achieved

    In the past eleven years, the situation of the Inner Mongolia nationality has undergone fundamental changes. This change is mainly manifested in: with the development of the cause of revolution and construction, and with the gradual maturity of various conditions, the unified regional autonomy of the Inner Mongolia region has been gradually realized. This has fundamentally changed the divided state of the Inner Mongolia nationality for more than 300 years, creating extremely favorable conditions for the economic and cultural development of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and advancing the development of the Mongolian nationality to a new stage.

    Fundamental Change in National Relations

    This change is manifested in the fundamental change in national relations. Due to the victory of the people's revolution, the establishment of the People's Republic of China, and the realization of regional autonomy, the relations between all fraternal nationalities, especially between the Mongolian and Han nationalities, have changed from the past relations of national oppression, estrangement, and discrimination to a new type of national relations of "national equality, close unity, mutual assistance, and common development." The people of all nationalities have truly realized equality in national status and all rights. In the War of Liberation, in various revolutionary struggles, and in production and various constructions, the people of all nationalities have formed a fighting alliance and brotherly friendship. In the socialist transformation of agriculture, in areas where nationalities live together, the people of all nationalities have organized a large number of joint national societies. They are organized into a single production unit in production and form an inseparable connection in life. The minority nationalities within the Autonomous Region have received due care and assistance in enjoying equal rights in various aspects. The Oroqen nationality has established an autonomous banner, and regional autonomy is now being actively studied for the Daur nationality and other minority nationalities based on their concentration and other conditions. The unity within the Mongolian nationality has also been strengthened. In the past, due to the instigation of reactionary rule and feudal oppression and separatism, there were many estrangements and disunity within the nationality. Due to the implementation of regional autonomy, the elimination of the reactionary class, and the implementation of patriotic internationalist education, the nationality has been closely united. In the unity within the nationality, uniting the upper strata of the nationality is of great significance. Uniting the upper strata of the nationality is an important factor in promoting unity within the nationality. We have carried out some work to unite all possible upper-level figures of the Mongolian nationality and other minority nationalities in the region, and their work and life have been given due arrangements and care.

    Socialist Ownership Has Gained an Absolute Advantage

    The changes in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are manifested in the changes and are changing the relations of production. Now socialist ownership has occupied an absolute advantage. In the process of gradually promoting national regional autonomy, we have gradually carried out various reforms. In the democratic revolution stage, we carried out land reform in agricultural areas, abolished feudal privileges in pastoral areas, implemented free grazing, and implemented the policy of benefiting both herdowners and herdsmen. In the socialist revolution the socialist transformation of agriculture handicrafts and Capitalist industry and commerce has achieved a decisive victory; The socialist transformation of animal husbandry is underway actively and steadily. Now 96% of farmers have joined agricultural producers' cooperatives. More than 78 percent of the total number of farm households participated in advanced cooperatives. 18% of herders have joined animal husbandry production cooperatives. Individual handicrafts have all been organized into cooperatives. The total output value of joint state-private industries accounts for more than 90 percent of the original private industry. Except for about 15% of small vendors who still maintain self-operation, all the rest of private commerce have been transformed into joint state-private enterprises. Private and individual transportation industries have also implemented joint state-private operation and organized transportation cooperatives. It is expected that the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce can be thoroughly completed in two or three years.

    Great Development in Industrial, Agricultural and Animal Husbandry Production

    The changes in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are also manifested in the great development of its economy and culture. In the past eleven years, industrial, agricultural and animal husbandry production in the Inner Mongolia region has greatly developed. Now there are 1,155 various local state-owned industrial enterprises. The industrial output value in 1955 increased more than twofold compared with 1952, accounting for more than 26% of the total output value of industry and agriculture. The state key construction projects centered on the Baotou industrial base are increasing day by day, the forest industry has greatly developed, and the Jier railway connecting China, Mongolia and the Soviet Union has been opened to traffic and joint transportation. The Baolan railway is under construction. These are of great significance for changing the face of the Autonomous Region. In agricultural production, the grain output in 1954 reached 3.88 million tons, with an average of more than 1,200 kilograms per agricultural population. 1955 was a year of poor harvest, and the grain output was 3.25 million tons, with an average of still 1,000 kilograms per agricultural population. The planned grain output for 1956 is 4.34 million tons. According to the current situation, the grain output can be completed and overfulfilled, with an average of more than 1,300 kilograms per agricultural population. In 1955, there were 22.79 million heads of livestock, an increase of more than twofold compared with the time of liberation.

    The Backward Cultural Population Decline is Being Changed

    With the development of production, cultural, educational and health undertakings have also achieved remarkable development, changing and changing the situation of cultural backwardness and population decline of the people of Inner Mongolia. In the era of reactionary rule, national culture and education were severely devastated, and the Mongolian language and writing were restricted. After liberation, the work of Mongolian language was developed. A Mongolian language college was established to train a group of Mongolian language professionals. The new Mongolian language is now being vigorously promoted. From 1952 to 1955, 643 kinds of Mongolian textbooks and various books and magazines were published, with 4,697,000 copies. The Mongolian edition of Selected Works of Mao Zedong was published. In terms of school education, the number of students in primary schools in the region in 1955 increased twofold compared with before liberation, and more than 80% of school-age children have enrolled in school. The number of middle school students in school has increased sixfold compared with before liberation. Before liberation, there were no universities and secondary vocational schools at all. Now there are three universities, one under construction, and seven secondary vocational schools for industry, agriculture, animal husbandry, forestry, commerce, health, etc. Social education has been widely carried out, and the movement to eliminate illiteracy has been launched. There has been development in literature, drama, music, dance, fine arts, etc., and a group of talents has been cultivated.

    In terms of health care, before liberation, Inner Mongolia had almost no health facilities, and the broad masses of people suffered from the harm of diseases, especially various diseases in pastoral areas, which seriously threatened the Inner Mongolia nationality. The population of various minority nationalities in Inner Mongolia was also declining day by day before liberation. This is a matter of survival for the Mongolian nationality and various minority nationalities in the Inner Mongolia region. The Party organization of Inner Mongolia put forward the slogan of "prosperity of both people and livestock" and developed health undertakings. It united the broad masses of doctors of Chinese and Western medicine and Lama doctors, and universally established medical institutions. The existing medical personnel have increased more than 23 times compared with before liberation. Now the population decline has been changed to population increase.

    With the development of economic, cultural and educational undertakings, the material and cultural life of the people has also improved.

    All these changes have created social and material conditions for the transition of the Inner Mongolia nationality to a socialist nationality. This is the victory of the Party's nationalities policy and the concrete manifestation of the superiority of national regional autonomy.

    How We Implement the Party's Nationalities Policy: Oppose Great-Han Chauvinism and Local Nationalism, Adhere to the Party's People's Democratic United Front Policy

    In carrying out the revolutionary struggle of the Mongolian nationality and in implementing the Party's policy of national regional autonomy, we have continuously carried out propaganda and education on the love of the motherland, consolidation of the unity of the motherland and the unity of all nationalities, and the Party's nationalities policy to the broad masses of cadres and people. We have adhered to the policy of striving for the assistance of fraternal nationalities, mainly the Han nationality, especially the Han cadres, to build the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and jointly build our great motherland, and opposed erroneous ideas such as great-Han chauvinism and local nationalism.

    Secondly, we have adhered to the Party's people's democratic united front policy and extensively united the people of all nationalities and all strata. In order to unite the upper-level figures of the Mongolian and other minority nationalities, we have adopted a policy of unity, persuasion and education, and consulted with them on all major affairs within the nationalities and obtained their support. For those who have made nationalist mistakes, we still adhere to the policy of striving for, uniting and educating them. In the western region of Inner Mongolia, we united and reformed the uprising troops and uprising personnel. While striving to unite the upper strata, we have adhered to the policy of boldly mobilizing the masses. We have vigorously carried out the work of mobilizing workers, farmers, herdsmen and revolutionary intellectuals. In this way, the Party's nationalities policy has been quickly grasped by the broad masses of the people of Inner Mongolia.

    Boldly Mobilize the Masses, Steadily Carry out Democratic Reform

    In boldly mobilizing the masses, we have adhered to the principle that the basic political and economic demands of the masses must be met, and adhered to the policy of steadily carrying out democratic reform. On the issue of carrying out democratic reform, on the one hand, we opposed the erroneous views that "Inner Mongolia has a special society, there is no need to carry out democratic reform," and "Inner Mongolia has no classes, there is no need to carry out land reform," etc.; on the other hand, we must also oppose mechanically copying the set of reform methods of the Han areas. In the pastoral areas, we put forward the policy of "no struggle, no division, no class division," and adopted a relatively mild method from top to bottom to abolish feudal privileges, declare free grazing, determine the wage policy of benefiting both herdowners and herdsmen, and adopt a light tax policy to support the economic development of herdsmen. These are all stipulated according to the characteristics of the pastoral economy. In reforming the land system, we paid attention to the ethnic relations in the land relations and stipulated some specific policies different from those in the Han areas. In the socialist transformation, for the transformation of animal husbandry, we have adhered to the principle of active leadership, prudent and steady progress, and determined the basic policy of relying on laboring herdsmen, uniting all forces that can be united, and steadily carrying out socialist transformation on the basis of stabilizing and developing production. We have determined to adopt a variety of forms of transformation that are relatively long-term, mild, and acceptable to herdsmen and herdowners; to ensure that the political status and living standards of herdowners are not reduced. In the socialist transformation of agriculture, in areas where nationalities live together and in joint national societies, we are inspecting and resolving the phenomenon that the income of some Mongolian and other minority farmers has declined, which may affect national unity.

    We emphasize that all reforms are for the purpose of developing production, and all must be combined with production and carried out on the basis of developing production. Therefore, all production is steadily developing upward.

    In implementing the policy of national regional autonomy, an army of the people was organized at the very beginning to participate in the War of Liberation and safeguard the cause of regional autonomy in Inner Mongolia.

    Cultivated a Large Number of Ethnic Cadres, Universally Developed Party Organizations

    In promoting regional autonomy and various tasks, we have paid great attention to cultivating ethnic cadres and developing the work of the Party. In the early stage of promoting regional autonomy, the work of cultivating ethnic cadres began. Over the past few years, a large number of Mongolian and other minority cadres have been trained. These cadres are widely distributed in political, economic, cultural, educational, health and other undertakings, and many comrades have already assumed various leadership positions, thereby gradually realizing the nationalization of autonomous organs. We have paid attention to universally establishing and developing the work of the Party, trade unions, the Communist Youth League and other people's organizations on the basis of the continuous improvement of the political consciousness of the people of all nationalities. As of the end of 1955, there were 3,936 Party branches and more than 167,000 Party members in the region. The Party's grassroots organizations have become a strong core for implementing the Party's policies and leading the unity of the people of all nationalities. The Party has tirelessly conducted and is conducting the Party's nationalities policy and patriotic and internationalist education among the broad masses of cadres and people, and constantly opposes the two tendencies of great-Han chauvinism and local nationalism in practical work. This is an important guarantee for implementing the Party's nationalities policy.

    Deficiencies and Errors in Our Work

    In the past eleven years, while the various tasks in the Inner Mongolia region have achieved significant results, many shortcomings and errors have also occurred. Some of these shortcomings and errors have been overcome and corrected under the timely instructions of the Party Central Committee, but they have also caused varying degrees of losses to the work. The main shortcomings and errors that we have today are: we have subjective idealism and bureaucratic work styles, we have an incomplete, shallow, and non-thorough understanding of the new national issues in socialist transformation and socialist construction, and we lack systematic inspection of the implementation of national policies in various economic and cultural tasks; we lack thorough investigation and research on many new situations that have emerged after the decisive victory of socialist transformation. As a result, some tasks cannot be well integrated with the ethnic and regional characteristics to implement the Party Central Committee's guidelines and policies, and sometimes there is a tendency to mechanically copy the work experience of other regions. We lack specific measures for the construction of pastoral areas. We lack due investigation, concern, and care for the special requirements of minority nationalities in the region in socialist construction. We have insufficient understanding and insufficient preparation for the speed of industrial development in the Autonomous Region. We lack a serious summary of the major tasks that have been carried out. Some issues that should have been reported to the Central Committee were not reported in a timely manner, and the Central Committee was not able to learn more about the situation in the Inner Mongolia region. The training of ethnic cadres has not kept up with the needs. All of these are what we should strive to improve in the future.

    Hopes for Relevant Work Departments of the Central Government

    The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is developing rapidly and has a large task in the country's socialist construction. We will, in accordance with the various reports and resolutions of the Party's Eighth National Congress, continue to strengthen the Party's leadership in socialist construction and socialist transformation, and consolidate the achievements of socialist transformation from political and ideological work and economic measures. And we will thoroughly complete the task of socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and private industry and commerce in two or three years. It is necessary to mobilize all forces to strive to complete and overfulfill the country's first five-year plan ahead of schedule and prepare for the second five-year plan. In order to successfully complete these tasks, in addition to learning honestly, continuously improving our leadership level, and earnestly overcoming shortcomings and errors, we request that the Party Central Committee give us more instructions and assistance, and request that the relevant work departments of the Central Committee learn more and more specifically about the actual situation in the Inner Mongolia region and appropriately take care of some of the special needs of the Autonomous Region. In the past, we were very satisfied with the leadership of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, but we also felt that the leading comrades of some work departments of the Central Committee had a shallow understanding of the Party's nationalities policy and a poor understanding of the actual situation and our specific difficulties in the national autonomous regions. Therefore, it is recommended that the Party Central Committee and the State Council's work departments learn more about the situation in the national autonomous regions and send more people to check and help with the work, so as to discover and solve problems in a timely manner.

### 党的民族政策在内蒙古地区的胜利

    党的民族政策在内蒙古地区的胜利
    中共内蒙古自治区委员会书记　奎璧同志的发言
    我完全同意党中央的政治报告、修改党章的报告和关于第二个五年计划的建议的报告。党中央从七大以来所执行的路线和各项政策是完全正确的。我完全拥护。
    党的少数民族工作是中国革命和建设祖国的伟大事业中一个不可缺少的组成部分。从“七大”到“八大”这十一年来，党在少数民族工作方面的成就也如同在其他事业方面的成就一样，是伟大的。内蒙古自治区的成就，就是党的民族政策辉煌胜利的一部分。
    内蒙古地区的大变化
    十一年来，内蒙古地区的党组织，在党中央的英明领导下，正确地执行了党的民族区域自治政策和其他各项政策，团结了区内各民族人民，进行了解放战争，逐步地推行了民族区域自治，顺利地完成了民主改革，取得了社会主义革命决定性的胜利，并且经过恢复发展生产之后，更进一步在国家统一计划下，进行着社会主义建设，发展了经济文化事业，提高了人民的物质和文化生活。现在内蒙古民族正在和全国各民族团结一致共同建设我们的伟大祖国，正在由一个落后的民族向着先进的社会主义民族过渡。实现了统一的区域自治
    十一年来，内蒙古民族的情况发生了根本变化。这个变化主要表现在：随着革命与建设事业的发展，随着各种条件的逐步成熟，逐步实现了内蒙古地区统一的区域自治。这就根本改变了三百多年来内蒙古民族的分割状态，为内蒙古自治区的经济文化的发展创造了极为有利的条件，使蒙古民族的发展推进到一个新的阶段。
    民族关系发生了根本改变
    这个变化表现在民族关系的根本改变。由于人民革命的胜利，中华人民共和国的建立，区域自治的实现，各兄弟民族之间，特别是在蒙汉民族之间，已由过去的民族压迫、隔阂、歧视的关系改变为“民族平等，亲密团结，互相帮助，共同发展”的新的民族关系。各民族之间真正实现了民族地位和一切权利方面的平等。各民族人民在解放战争中，在各种革命斗争中，在生产和各种建设中，形成了战斗联盟和兄弟般的友谊。在农业的社会主义改造中，在民族杂居区，各民族人民组织了大批的民族联合社，他们在生产上组织到一个生产单位里，在生活上形成不可分离的联系。自治区内的少数民族在享受各种权利平等方面得到了应有的照顾和帮助。鄂伦春族建立了自治旗，对达斡尔族及其他少数民族，现在正在根据他们的聚居情况及其他条件积极研究实行区域自治。蒙古民族内部的团结也加强了。过去由于反动统治的挑拨和封建压迫、割据，民族内部存在着很多隔阂，互不团结。由于区域自治的实行，反动阶级的消灭，并进行了爱国主义国际主义教育，民族内部已经紧密地团结起来了。在民族内部的团结上，团结民族上层是有重要意义的。团结民族上层人物是促进民族内部团结的一个重要因素。我们对蒙古族和境内其他少数民族的一切可能团结的上层人物都进行了一些团结工作，他们的工作和生活都得到了应有的安排和照顾。
    社会主义所有制已占绝对优势
    内蒙古自治区的变化表现在改变了和正在改变着生产关系。现在社会主义所有制已经占居了绝对优势。我们在逐步推行民族区域自治的过程中，就逐步进行了各项改革。在民主革命阶段，在农业区我们进行了改革土地制度，在牧区废除了封建特权，实行自由放牧，和牧主牧工两利政策等。在社会主义革命中，对农业、手工业、资本主义工商业的社会主义改造已经取得了决定性的胜利；牧业的社会主义改造正在积极稳步进行中。现在已经有百分之九十六的农户参加了农业生产合作社。参加高级社的占总农户的百分之七十八以上。参加牧业生产合作社的牧户已占总牧户的百分之十八以上。个体手工业已经全部组织到合作社内。公私合营工业总产值占原有私营工业的百分之九十以上。私营商业除百分之十五左右的小商小贩仍保持自营外，其余全部分别改造为公私合营企业。私营和个体运输业也分别实行了公私合营和组织了运输合作社。预计农业、手工业、资本主义工商业的社会主义改造在二、三年内即可彻底完成。
    工农牧业生产有很大发展
    内蒙古自治区的变化，还表现在经济文化获得了很大发展。十一年来，内蒙古地区工农牧业生产有很大发展。现在各种地方国营工业企业已达一千一百五十五个。一九五五年的工业产值较一九五二年增长两倍多，占工农业总产值的百分之二十六以上。以包头工业基地为中心的国家重点建设一天天增多，森林工业有了很大发展，连接中蒙苏三国的集二铁路已经通车联运，包兰铁路正在建筑，这些对于改变自治区的面貌都是有重大意义的。农业生产，一九五四年的粮食产量已经达到三百八十八万吨，每个农业人口平均一千二百多斤。一九五五年是个歉收年，粮食产量是三百二十五万吨，每个农业人口平均仍达一千斤。一九五六年粮食计划产量为四百三十四万吨，根据目前情况，粮食产量是可以完成和超额完成计划的，每个农业人口平均预计可达一千三百多斤。一九五五年牲畜已达二千二百七十九万头，比解放时增长两倍多。
    文化落后人口下降状况正在改变
    随着生产的发展，文化教育卫生事业也得到显著的发展，改变了和改变着内蒙古人民的文化落后人口下降的状况。在反动统治时代，民族文化教育受到了极严重的摧残，蒙古语言文字被限制。解放后发展了蒙古语文工作。设立了蒙文专科学校，培养了一批蒙文专门人材。现在正在大力推广新蒙文。从一九五二年到一九五五年出版了各种蒙文教科书和各种图书、杂志六百四十三种，四百六十九万七千册。出版了蒙文毛泽东选集。学校教育方面，一九五五年全区小学在校学生比解放前增加二倍，百分之八十以上的学龄儿童都入了学。在校的中学生比解放前增加六倍。解放前根本没有高等学校和中等专业学校，现在已有高等学校三所，正在建设中的一所，并有工业、农牧业、林业、商业、卫生等七所中等专业学校。普遍开展了社会教育，开展了扫除文盲运动。在文学、戏剧、音乐、舞蹈、美术等方面都有了发展，并且培养了一批人材。
    在卫生事业方面，解放以前，内蒙古几乎没有什么卫生设施，广大人民遭受着疾病的危害，特别是牧业区的各种疾病更严重地威胁着内蒙古民族。内蒙区各少数民族在解放前的人口也是一天天下降，这是蒙古民族和内蒙区各少数民族的生存问题。内蒙古的党组织提出了“人畜两旺”的号召，发展了卫生事业。团结了广大的中西医、喇嘛医，普遍建立了医疗机构，现有的医务人员较解放前增加了二十三倍以上。现在已经由人口下降变为人口上升。
    随着经济文化教育事业的发展，人民的物质和文化生活也提高了。
    以上这些变化，都给内蒙古民族向社会主义民族过渡创造了社会和物质条件。这是党的民族政策的胜利，是民族区域自治的优越性的具体表现。
    我们是怎样执行党的民族政策的反对大民族主义和地方民族主义，坚持党的人民民主统一战线政策
    我们在进行蒙古民族的革命斗争中，在执行党的民族区域自治政策的过程中，对广大干部和群众不断地进行了热爱祖国巩固祖国的统一和各民族团结、党的民族政策的宣传教育，坚持了争取兄弟民族，主要是汉族特别是汉族干部的援助，建设内蒙古自治区共同建设我们伟大祖国的方针，反对了那些大民族主义和地方民族主义等错误思想。
    其次，坚持了党的人民民主统一战线政策，广泛地团结了各民族各阶层人民。为了团结蒙古和其他少数民族上层人物，我们采取了团结、说服教育的政策，一切民族内部的重大事务都与他们协商，取得他们的赞助；对那些犯过民族主义错误的人，我们仍然坚持争取、团结教育的方针。在内蒙古西部地区，团结改造了起义部队和起义人员。在争取团结上层的同时，坚持了放手发动群众的方针。大力进行了发动工人、农民、牧民和革命知识青年的工作。这样，党的民族政策就迅速地为广大内蒙古人民所掌握。
    放手发动群众，稳步进行民主改革
    在放手发动群众中，我们坚持了必须满足基本群众的政治经济要求，坚持了稳步地进行民主改革的方针。在进行民主改革问题上，一方面反对了那些认为“内蒙古社会特殊，不必进行民主改革”，“内蒙古社会无阶级，不必进行土地改革”等等错误主张；一方面也要反对搬套汉族地区的一套改革方法。我们在牧业区提出了“不斗不分，不划阶级”的政策，采取了自上而下的比较和缓的方式，取消了封建特权，宣布自由放牧，确定了牧主牧工两利的工资政策，采取了扶助牧民经济发展的轻税政策。这些都是根据牧业经济的特点所规定的。在改革土地制度中，我们注意到土地关系中的民族关系，规定了有别于汉族地区的一些具体政策。在社会主义改造中，对牧业的改造，我们坚持了积极领导慎重稳进的方针，确定了依靠劳动牧民，团结一切可能团结的力量，在稳定发展生产的基础上，稳步地进行社会主义改造的基本政策。我们确定了采取比较长期的、和缓的、为牧民和牧主乐意接受的多种多样的形式进行改造；对于牧主要保障他们的政治地位和生活水平不致下降。在农业的社会主义改造中，在民族杂居区在民族联合社内，发现有些蒙古和其他少数民族农民收入下降的状况以致可能影响民族团结的现象，我们正在检查解决中。
    我们强调了各项改革都是为了发展生产，都必须结合生产，在发展生产的基础上去进行。所以各项生产都是稳步向上发展的。
    在执行民族区域自治政策中，一开始就组织了一支人民军队，参加了解放战争，保卫了内蒙古区域自治事业。
    培养了大批民族干部，普遍发展了党的组织
    在推行区域自治和各种工作中，我们十分注意了培养民族干部和发展党的工作。在推行区域自治的初期，就开始了培养民族干部的工作。几年来，已经培养了大批蒙古和其他少数民族干部。这些干部广泛分布在政治经济、文教、卫生等事业中，有许多同志已经担任了各项领导工作，从而逐步实现了自治机关民族化。我们注意了在各民族人民政治觉悟不断提高的基础上，普遍地进行了建立和发展了党、工会、青年团及其他人民团体的工作。截至一九五五年底，全区已有党支部三千九百三十六个，党员十六万七千多名，党的基层组织已成为执行党的政策、领导团结各民族人民的坚强核心。党在广大干部和人民群众中不倦地进行了和进行着党的民族政策和爱国主义与国际主义教育，不断地在实际工作中反对大民族主义和地方民族主义两种倾向，这是贯彻执行党的民族政策的重要保证。
    我们工作中的缺点和错误
    十一年来，内蒙古地区的各项工作，在取得重大成绩的同时，也产生过不少缺点和错误，其中有些缺点和错误在党中央及时地指示下，得到了克服和纠正，但也使工作遭到不同程度的损失。我们今天存在的主要缺点和错误是：我们存在着主观主义思想和官僚主义作风，我们对社会主义改造和社会主义建设中的新的民族问题了解的不全不深不透，对于在各种经济和文化工作中执行民族政策的情况缺乏系统的检查；对于社会主义改造取得决定性的胜利后所出现的许多新情况缺乏周密的调查研究。因之，有些工作就不能很好地结合民族的和地区的特点来执行党中央的方针政策，有时还出现搬套别的地区工作经验的偏向，我们对牧区建设缺乏具体措施。我们对区内少数民族在社会主义建设中的特殊要求，缺乏应有的调查、关心和照顾。对自治区工业发展速度认识不足，准备不够。我们对已经进行的各项主要工作缺乏认真的总结，有些应该向中央反映的问题没有及时反映，未能使中央更多地了解内蒙古地区的情况。对民族干部的培养赶不上需要。所有这些，都是我们今后应该努力改进的。
    对中央有关工作部门的希望
    内蒙古自治区在国家社会主义建设中，发展很快，任务很大，我们定将根据这次党的八次代表大会的各项报告和决议，继续加强党对社会主义建设和社会主义改造的领导，从政治思想工作上，经济措施上巩固社会主义改造已取得的成果。并要在两三年内彻底完成农业、手工业、私营工商业社会主义改造的任务。要动员一切力量争取提前和超额完成国家第一个五年计划和做好第二个五年计划的准备工作。为了胜利地完成这些任务，除了我们要老老实实地学习，不断提高领导水平，认真克服缺点与错误以外，要求党中央更多地给我们一些指示和帮助，要求中央的有关工作部门更多地更具体地了解内蒙古地区的实际情况，适当地照顾自治区的一些特殊需要。过去，我们对于党中央和国务院的领导是非常满意的，但还感到中央和国务院某些工作部门的领导同志对党的民族政策体会不深，对民族自治地方的实际情况和我们的具体困难了解较差。因此，建议党中央和国务院各工作部门多了解民族自治区的情况，多派人下去检查和帮助工作，以便及时发现和解决问题。
