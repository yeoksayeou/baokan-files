    How Much is the Labor of a Traditional Chinese Painter Worth?
    Yu Feian

    Since Premier Zhou raised the issue of intellectuals, traditional Chinese painters have been greatly encouraged, believing that "traditional Chinese painting" will also enter a new stage. Some traditional Chinese painters in Beijing who have not yet obtained job positions have also found some work to do, namely painting bamboo curtains and bookmarks. This is organized by the Fine Arts Service Department and the Cultural Goods Company through the Beijing Chinese Painting Research Association for painters to create. The cost of each bookmark averages seven cents.

    Bamboo curtains are a specialty of Sichuan. Their size, excluding the borders, only considers the painted area. The largest is 1.6 chi wide and 6 chi long, and the smallest is 1 chi wide and 2 chi long. They want traditional Chinese painters in the capital to paint landscapes, figures, flowers, birds, insects, and fish with "national forms" of painting, and to sign and stamp them. The "brush fee" for the largest bamboo curtain is 1.2 yuan per piece. Below this, down to the smallest bamboo curtain, the "brush fee" is all 1 yuan per piece. The largest bamboo curtain can only be completed one to two pieces per day by each painter, and the smallest can only be completed three pieces. However, the painters believe that painting bamboo curtains is more enjoyable than painting small bookmarks, and can also earn more foreign exchange for the country. Signing and stamping, so be it. However, painting bamboo curtains is not always available, and livelihood is important, so it is still necessary to paint bookmarks.

    Last month, the International Bookstore commissioned the Fine Arts Service Department to order 2,000 so-called "high-end" traditional Chinese painting bookmarks, for which painters could receive 15 cents per bookmark. The painters diligently completed them as scheduled, but now more than 800 have been "returned" for being considered incompatible with the national style. In our opinion, these 800-plus bookmarks are not only rich in national style, but also many are quite good works. We don't know what higher standards were used to measure the 1,200 or so that were considered to conform to the "national style" and were accepted? The so-called "good news of traditional Chinese painting" in the People's Daily about the establishment of the Chinese Painting Academy is still awaiting overall planning, and the so-called "Traditional Chinese Painting Production Cooperative" is still in preparation. Traditional Chinese painters in the capital who have no job positions and no regular and fixed income rush to paint forty or fifty "national forms" bookmarks day and night, which could originally solve their living expenses for a day or two, but are often considered "incompatible with the national style" and returned. What exactly is called "national form"? How much is the "national form" worth!

    国画家的劳动值多少钱
    于非闇
    自从周总理提出了知识分子问题以后，国画家们无不欢欣鼓舞，认为“国画”也将进入新的阶段。北京一部分还没有得到工作岗位的国画家们，也有了一些工作可作，那就是画竹帘和书签。这是由美术服务部和文化用品公司通过北京中国画研究会组织画家们绘制的。每个书签的代价，平均是七分钱。
    竹帘是四川的特产，它的尺寸，不算四边，光论画心，最大的是宽一尺六寸，长六尺，最小的是宽一尺，长二尺。要首都的国画家在上面画山水人物、花鸟虫鱼等“民族形式”的绘画，并且要签名盖章。最大的竹帘，给画家的“笔润”是每件一元二角。在这以下到最小的竹帘，每件“笔润”全是一元。最大的竹帘，每位画家每天只能画成一件到两件，最小的也只能画成三件。但画家们认为画竹帘总比画小小的书签要痛快些，还可以给国家多换回一些外汇。签名盖章，就签名盖章吧。但是，画竹帘并不是经常有的，生活要紧，还是要画书签。
    上月国际书店通过美术服务部定画两千个所谓“高级的”国画书签，每个书签，画家可以得到一角五分。画家们兢兢业业地如期完成了，但现在认为不合民族风格被“休回来”的倒有八百余个。这八百余个书签，在我们看来，不但都是富有民族风格的，而且，还有很多是相当好的作品。不知道被认为合乎“民族风格”而收留的一千二百来个是被用什么样更高的标尺衡量的？人民日报刊登的关于将要成立中国画院的所谓“国画喜讯”尚有待于统筹，所谓“国画生产社”，还在筹备。首都没有工作岗位、没有经常和固定收入的国画家们，日夜赶着画出四十、五十个“民族形式”的书签，本来也可以解决一两天的生活，但又往往被认为“不合民族风格”，退了回来。到底什么叫做“民族形式”？“民族形式”到底值几个钱！
