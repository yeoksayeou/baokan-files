Xinhua News Agency, Mangya, September 25th (Xinhua Reporter Peng Xue) reported: The first exploration well in the Leng Lake exploration area of the Qaidam Basin gushed a large amount of crude oil during the oil testing process.

    The oil testing of this exploration well began on September 11. Initially, mostly water was ejected; from the 20th onwards, a large amount of golden crude oil continuously flowed from the delivery pipe into the large oil tank. The oil layer pressure of this exploration well is very high, allowing for continuous self-flow.

    When the crude oil gushed out of the delivery pipe, the workers standing around watching were very excited. They jumped and laughed happily, discussing with each other, saying: This is the strength we add to the construction of a socialist society.

    Yesterday, the reporter interviewed Liu Shuren, Chief Engineer of the Qinghai Petroleum Exploration Bureau, about the oil testing situation in the Leng Lake exploration area. He said: The crude oil gushing from this exploration well is of excellent quality. Based on the oil production situation, it definitely has industrial production value.

    Currently, the Qinghai Petroleum Exploration Bureau is carrying out base construction in the Leng Lake exploration area, preparing to conduct large-scale drilling work here.

    柴达木冷湖探区
    第一口探井大量喷油
    据新华社茫崖25日电　新华社记者彭雪报道：柴达木盆地冷湖探区的第一口探井，在试油过程中喷出了大量原油。
    这口探井的试油工作是9月11日开始的。最初喷出的大部是水；从20日起，就有大量黄澄澄的原油从利得管不断地流向大油罐内。这口探井的油层压力很大，可以连续自喷。
    当原油从利得管喷出的时候，站在周围观看的职工十分兴奋。他们高兴地跳着，笑着，互相谈论说：这就是我们给建设社会主义社会增加的力量。
    昨天，记者就冷湖探区试油情况访问了青海石油勘探局总工程师刘树人。他说：这口探井喷出的原油质量优良。根据出油情况来看，肯定有工业生产价值。
    现在，青海石油勘探局已经在冷湖探区进行基地建设，准备在这里进行大规模的钻探工作。
