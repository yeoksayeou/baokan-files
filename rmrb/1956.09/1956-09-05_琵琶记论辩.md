Debate on the Pipa Ji

Xu Zhiqiao

The Pipa Ji, like many works in the past, has its limitations and shortcomings. However, to judge it solely based on its "declaration" or, according to opinions like Mao Shengshan's, to assert that it propagates feudal morality, would be to overlook the complexity of this work. The Pipa Ji writes about feudal "five relationships," but if we understand the social contradictions it reflects from the entire development of its dramatic conflicts, then what it objectively achieves is not "complete five relationships," but the contradictions between these ethical relationships and real life. Starting from this point, we should affirm its significance.

Cai Bojie's path, the conflicts he faces, and his mental state all embody this contradiction. From the beginning, he is already in contact with the contradiction between two different views of life: Cai Gong's belief that "to be a man, one must bring honor to ancestors and advise my son to gallop towards a bright future," is opposed to Cai Po's "true happiness lies in the fields, why bother with dukes and lords," and Bojie and his wife's life wish of "ten thousand taels of gold are not precious, a family's peace is worth more." And this is the beginning of the basic contradiction of the whole play. Moreover, this contradiction has a social nature, because it is caused by the social system. Cai Gong's naive yearning for "if you return home in brocade, I will be happy even if I die," is a social ideology that has long poisoned people's minds. This is combined with the feudal ruling class's ethical view that "filial piety begins with serving parents, continues with serving the ruler, and ends with establishing oneself." And Cai Bojie's "willing to endure poverty and practice filial piety" is in conflict with Cai Gong's "ethics" at this time; moreover, Cai Po and Wuniang, of course, cannot jump out of the scope of feudal ethics; Gao Zecheng is indeed "protecting" them and sympathizing with them. But what he reveals is precisely the contradiction between this ethics that meets the requirements of life and the ethics of Cai Zhang and others at this time that "if one can take off the white and put on the green... this is both loyalty and filial piety." Under the domination of this thought, Cai Gong "does not want his son to be a man, but only wants his son to be an official" (Li Zhuowu), and after forcing Cai Bojie to "reluctantly go to the spring examination," he is forced into deeper contradictions.

Cai Bojie did embark on the "ideal" path that many scholar-officials dreamed of, but the question is: Gao Zecheng wrote about the "Three Not Following Pipa Ji," and Cai Bojie also lamented "Three times forced, who can I tell my heartfelt affairs to?" The will of his father, the emperor, and the prime minister, and the path of going to the exam, becoming an official, and becoming the son-in-law of a high-ranking official, is precisely the wonderful path to "boundless prospects," but this violates his reasonable wishes, so he calls it "three times forced." This is clearly a contradiction between two different concepts. He is a tragic figure under the control of this system and concept. And what Gao Zecheng wrote is not a eulogy to this standard direction, but a reflection of its contradictions. It is the contradiction caused on this "ideal path" that runs through the entire play, and thus produces a greater tragedy of life and ethics. This is the basic content of the dramatic conflict of the Pipa Ji.

For Cai Bojie, this conflict is expressed in "the leading position is enviable, but one must know that wealth is not my wish," and in his longing for his hometown when "feasting in Xingyuan (杏园)"; it is also expressed in his plan to "resign from office" before he knows about the "marriage proposal." Despite this, if he insists on continuing, he will inevitably "anger the court." This is not only due to the "bullish nature" of Grand Tutor Niu who "dares to fight with me," but also makes the "court" "angry" because of this unresolvable established situation. The old woman in the prime minister's mansion is right: "If it weren't for your father making trouble, people would spread rumors. They say you are the daughter of a duke and marquis of the prime minister's mansion, and you can't marry a top scholar." What's more, this is because the emperor has taken a fancy to his good talent and wants to "personally arrange" the marriage? It can be seen that this is not just Niu Xiang's personal character and temper, but the will and reputation of the "golden mouth" (the emperor) to the "prime minister's mansion" that cannot be lightly violated or shaken. The environment, system, concepts, and the actual situation at this time and place are not easy for Cai Bojie, who is just starting out, to understand. He still naively thinks that "if I don't provide delicacies to my parents, I am ashamed to eat my salary," and "how can I get married without informing my parents," these great principles of "loyalty and filial piety can be fulfilled perfectly" cannot be denied by the emperor. But, as Chen Jiru said: "How can a scholar know the law of the king!" When the "imperial decree" is issued, he still thinks that the eunuch is "哄" (deceiving) him, and he naively hopes that the eunuch can "report to the emperor again: I would rather not be an official!" He even panics and wants to "return the imperial decree himself." Until the eunuch tells him "who dares to disobey the imperial decree," and "this is not a place to make noise," he realizes: what is "startling" is this "imperial decree with a phoenix pattern"!

If "being forced by my parents to go to the examination hall" is due to "for the sake of filial piety, it is difficult to refuse parental orders"; then "being forced by the emperor to be an official as a courtier, being forced to marry like a phoenix and a phoenix" is due to "respecting the emperor's orders": "Filial piety is great, but it ends in serving the ruler." And this kind of "ethics" is regarded as "the way that people always follow" from the court, to the society, to the family, and even to matchmakers, old women, and eunuchs, but it contradicts real life. It is this common thought that becomes the dominant force running through the entire play, making Cai Bojie trapped in the contradiction of "can't get rid of fame, but how to avoid the misfortune that is sent to me." And this is the root cause of his "loss of morality and lack of reputation." This is clearly not "praising virtues." It is true that the "grace" that scholar-officials in the past longed for has been concentrated on him, but his "luck" is precisely his misfortune. Tragedy arises not only from the bondage of the body, but also from the suppression of the spirit. "Thinking carefully, is this what I want?" "This son-in-law, it is difficult to ask me to be frank!" And what formed this bad result is "not coming to Chang'an to see the flowers," is "the emperor does not agree," is that startling "imperial decree with a phoenix pattern." And this resentment is the main thought running through his heart. Regardless of whether this is a conscious arrangement by the author, objectively, the opposition between Cai Bojie's ethical view and the ethical view on this "ideal path" that has become the dominant force is clearly expressed through the contradiction of "three times forced."

But his contradictions, distress, and resentment do not stop there. For three years of official residence life, he is only "vague and unclear" and "wears a worried look." The reason for this is because he is forced into that so-called "beautiful scenery" but is actually a life of "trembling with fear of breaking the law," and even more because "the power of the old prime minister is so great" that he has to discuss with the courtyard manager to find a way to send a letter home. He and Niu Niu are also only "a good marriage turned into a bad marriage," "husband and wife only speak three-tenths of their hearts, and cannot completely abandon one heart." This makes him have to make a living in contradiction: on the one hand, it is inevitable that there will be contradictions between the "new string" and the "old string"; on the other hand, he never forgets the ethical view of "reading poetry since childhood, and being a filial son requires being exemplary." All this pain and trouble is concentrated in the famous curse in the thirty-seventh act, issued through self-condemnation. The dialogue has already explained: "When I was young, my parents taught me to read poetry and know filial piety, who knew that I would be misled by poetry." This is also the so-called "after all, it is the article that misled me, I misled my parents," "the article misled me, I misled my wife." This kind of curse, just like "better to be Yan Ziling climbing the fishing platform," is also related to the idea of "better to have someone who is illiterate, who can serve until the end," "better to be a righteous farmer for life."

Poetry, in the feudal era, was generally regarded as the code of ethics and morality. It itself can also be regarded as a synonym for feudal dogma. And Cai Bojie, he has been absorbing education and accepting concepts from poetry since he was sensible, and his view of life cannot jump out of the feudal ethics, and he is also a quite sincere believer. His "refusal to take the exam," "refusal to be an official," and "refusal to marry" are precisely because he has this ethical view. But on the other hand, the reason for "three times not following" is precisely due to the same system, and the unshakable ethical view of "starting with serving parents, continuing with serving the ruler, and ending with establishing oneself." The problem lies here: it is precisely this common ethical concept from father to ruler that forces him to take the "ideal" path that conforms to this ethical view, and it is also this ethical view and this path that caused his tragedy. The basic contradiction of the Pipa Ji is rooted in this. Developing, it further creates the tragedy of his whole family. Therefore, as the final scene of Bojie and his wife in "Sad Meeting in the Study" says: "Only because of the three times not following the ruler and parents, it caused the separation of flesh and blood," this is the root cause of this tragic result.

Here, or as Li Zhuowu unintentionally said, the contradiction between "being an official" and "being a man." But the problem still lies in: the "three not following" and his having to "follow" are all due to the ethical view of this same system: his three "refusals" are due to "striving to practice filial piety," due to "not abandoning the wife who shares weal and woe," due to his unwillingness to "lose morality and lack reputation." And his "three times forced" are due to the system and its ethics that stipulate respecting parental orders and respecting the emperor's orders. Loyalty and filial piety, being an official and being a man, were originally the ideal direction unified under this ethical requirement: being an official is considered being a man, which is both "establishing oneself" and "serving the ruler" and "serving parents." And he did rise rapidly, and he did not change his original intention. But precisely because he embarked on this path, he violated this ethics and failed his "life's wish" under the guidance of this ethics: he is unfilial, unintentional to be loyal, and cannot be considered to have established himself. He is unable and impossible to resolve this contradiction. Therefore, this forms his spiritual tragedy. This is ultimately determined by the feudal system and its ethics itself. Because the various ethics that are rooted in society and family and consolidate this system happen to contradict real life and its reasonable requirements. Of course, there is also the common feeling of Yuan Dynasty literati being suppressed and unable to find a way out. But the main thing is that it tortuously reflects the contradiction that this ethics and its system cannot justify themselves, and the various unresolvable contradictions between its "path" and life.

The issue of ethics and its system is a major issue of fundamental nature throughout the long period of feudal society in China. If the Pipa Ji, in its main aspects, and especially with Cai Bojie, a tragic figure who has embarked on the "beautiful scenery" that "everyone envies," as the theme clue, truthfully reflects the various contradictions between the feudal social system itself, ethics itself, and real life to the best of its ability within the limitations of the social history of the 14th century, then it reflects a major social contradiction. The objective social significance of the Pipa Ji lies here. Therefore, despite its contradictions and shortcomings, in terms of the significance of this image, our past evaluation of it has not been too high, but too low.

People also have different praises and criticisms for Zhao Wuniang. Since the Ming and Qing dynasties, she has been called "filial woman, virtuous woman, holy woman" by scholar-officials. Now, some people also think that Gao Zecheng is using this "standard virtuous person" to carry out his "beneficial to social morals" propaganda. It is undeniable that the author sings praises of this woman with all his sympathy, and it is undeniable that if she did not have the thoughts and feelings of the feudal era, it would be unimaginable. But the question is: is such a "virtuous person" "beautiful"? What kind of fate does she and her parents-in-law suffer in what kind of social and life contradictions?

Initially, Zhao Wuniang's only "yearning" was only "wishing to marry a couple who can grow old together and serve the elderly parents-in-law." But after the "forced examination," Cai Bojie had to go, and many practical problems such as "tens of thousands of miles of mountains and rivers," "who will take care of the eighty-year-old parents?" were piled on her, and her character changed. He and his wife are "tears for the father, tears for the mother, never worried about husband and wife." Even so, his "father is going" but "does not follow the remonstrance," and even when his parents come, he has to "wipe away tears." This means that she has to cover up her bitterness. "In the meantime, how can people not be sad and resentful?" – This is a detail. However, even this moment reflects the contradictions that run through the entire play, between the system, ethics, and life, and within themselves. It is in the various contradictions sparked by this moment of dramatic conflict that we see the first spark of the spiritual world hidden deep in Zhao Wuniang's heart. Here, her contradictions are also brewing. On the one hand, "sorrow is not a broken string, sorrow is not a divided mirror. Only worry about the high hall, the candle is uncertain"; on the other hand, "I am a daughter-in-law who serves her parents-in-law without you saying it, and when will you, as a child, leave your parents?"; on the one hand, her "heartfelt affairs are thousands," "but I am afraid of adding entanglements"; on the other hand, "how can I finish my complaints, my whole body is difficult." And we see her kindness, her concepts, and her suppressed mood from her complaints that she dare not complain. But in the Middle Ages, for ordinary women in China, it is both universal and mostly a lonely mood buried deep in the heart. Therefore, when her simplest wish of "hoping to serve her parents together with him and grow old for a hundred years" is shattered, her "sigh" is all the more meaningful because it cannot be told to others. Therefore, when her complaints, worries, and anxieties turn into: "Since I have been entrusted with Pingfan, what is there to decline. I might as well be a filial wife and virtuous wife, and I will be known in history. Today, I have suffered some leisure and distress. Hey, I will support myself here, and don't stain his name, I will protect him anyway," here is her sacrifice and pain that she has to do. And after all, it is she who bears the entire burden and disaster of life. And this is precisely the tragic fate of Zhao Wuniang and others stipulated by feudal society.

This image was created in the 14th century, and in her ethics and view of life, it is impossible to break away from the ideological consciousness dominated by the feudal era and its system. She does live in the hierarchical relationship and concepts that are indispensable in feudal society and its families, and she treats her parents-in-law and husband in this way. Despite this, or, it can also be said: precisely because of this, her "heartfelt affairs" are "thousands," and her whole body is even more "difficult." Here, there is her tragedy. Therefore, for hundreds of years, the reason why this image has been "known to every household" lies not in the isolated concepts of filial piety and virtue, but mainly in her sacrifices in her situation and her pure spirit towards life. If that ethical relationship and its system itself caused Cai Bojie's tragedy of life and ethics, then another direct result is the tragic experience of Zhao Wuniang and her parents-in-law. If the feudal ethical relationship and its concept formed Cai Bojie's contradiction between "being a man" and "being an official," and this path and this system caused his "loss of morality and lack of reputation," then what we see in the development of the entire life tragedy of Zhao Wuniang and her parents-in-law is precisely the tragedy of these "good people" (Cai Gong's words, Act 17) who are dominated by such ethical relationships and concepts. If the tragedy of this family all stems from the same cause-and-effect contradiction, then the greatest pressure of bearing this tragedy is Zhao Wuniang. Because she bears the dual burden of daughter-in-law and son. She has to "serve her parents-in-law," which means that she lives in the hierarchical relationship and concepts of parents-in-law and daughter-in-law, and also lives in the contradiction between parents-in-law. She has to "support the family," and as a woman in the feudal era, she also experiences the natural and man-made disasters outside the family. She bears the entire life, so people see in her tragic spirit the common historical destiny of many ancient women. Her tragedy embodies a commendable and tearful ideological emotion that inspires people's sympathy and indignation.

If the contradiction between Cai Gong and Cai Po is due to "nothing for the sake of fame, not wanting him to provide delicacies, teaching him to be an official, wanting to change the family's appearance, I am afraid that you will be a ghost when he is an official... and implicating my child because you cannot be a good scholar"; if the contradiction between Zhao Wuniang and her parents-in-law is due to her having to be stipulated in the hierarchical relationship and concepts of feudal ethics, and she has to endure hunger and starvation in the face of natural and man-made disasters, bearing the responsibility and obligation of "the life of her parents-in-law"; then this family's "three years without a full and warm day," this family's tragic tragedy, also stems from the general contradiction that runs through the entire play. "I sigh that it was not me in the first place, it is better for me to die without any worries" (Act 11); "I didn't think about it at first, teaching my child to go to the imperial capital, making my daughter-in-law suffer and be lonely, sending my mother-in-law to the road to the underworld, it is my fault, it is better for me to die, so as not to fail you again" (Act 21); Cai Gong's painful self-blame after various tragic experiences, before understanding "at first I only thought that Cai Bojie was greedy for fame and profit and refused to go home, but he was detained here" (Act 36, Wuniang's words), seems to be directed at Cai Bojie, after understanding "only because of the three times not following the ruler and parents, it caused the separation of flesh and blood," then its sharpness is also directed at Cai Gong himself, who caused this tragedy of social contradiction, and is also a victim who was initially anesthetized and finally remorseful. Therefore, the tragic image of this couple, in the development of the entire dramatic conflict, also expresses the thematic significance associated with its basic contradiction. Similarly, "suffering only suffers Zhao Wuniang's diligent woman," her role in this tragic artistic structure is not just simply understood as a contrast between "one poor and one rich" from the alternation of "scenes." This will reduce the significance of the Pipa Ji, and this also comes from ignoring the curses and indignation issued by Cai Bojie on his tragic path. For Cai Gongpo, especially Cai Bojie, the author is obviously both sympathetic and critical of them through the characters' self-condemnation. But for Wuniang, he sympathizes with her situation and also sings praises of her heart – in the meantime, of course, he also sings praises of her ethical feelings. But, since Cai Bojie is "better to be a righteous farmer for life," then the contrast role of Zhao Wuniang's image in the artistic structure shows that the "righteousness" that truly comes from the pure heart is only in "the wife who shares weal and woe," only in the folk, and not on the "ideal" path leading to "wealth and fame," leading to the official! Although the author and the heroine's ethical emotions cannot jump out of the historical limitations of the Middle Ages, this is unfavorable and opposed to the various ethics that dominate and anesthetize people by the ruling class. What's more, she is just a person who is dominated by feudal ethics and has to bear all the difficulties of life, and is therefore also a victim. If Cai Bojie's lyricism reveals his indignation, then behind her "endless tears" there are countless "subtexts": she "simply does," "anyway for him," but she is after all "all kinds of hardships have been experienced, the suffering person eats the bitter taste, two sufferings meet, can know that you want to swallow but can't." She eats the bitter taste, so that her parents-in-law "complain about killing me, and I dare not say." But, "I have suffered all kinds of hardships, what suspicion? Can't I say that my face is yellow and my bones are like firewood!" When Cai Gong writes his will, considering "if you don't marry, I am afraid you won't be able to live, if you don't observe filial piety, you will be talked about," on the one hand, she says "the public is strict, the slave dares not violate"; on the other hand, she also believes that if she marries, "I am afraid it will be like Bojie again, but it will delay my life." This is really the view of a heartbroken person. This is like saying: marrying anyone is the same fate. And this is precisely the fate that has been determined by history. "It is not that the slave is bitter to spread the name of filial piety, it is easy to catch a tiger on the mountain, it is difficult to open your mouth to tell people." "Hair, it is I who delayed your youth, and now I am cutting it to send to the old parents." "Public, you wanted him to pick osmanthus and see the flowers early, but you sent yourself to the white poplar grave... who do you tell this bitterness to?" Her bitterness and resentment are always revealed in this kind of unavoidable and roundabout way. It is here that we see the "her herself" deep in her heart. From her, we see the heart of an ordinary woman in the past era. Her typical significance lies here: her character embodies the character of the ancient people, and her tragic history is also the history of tens of millions of "coarse clothes and skirts" in ancient Chinese society.

Just as we cannot completely erase the realistic content of the Pipa Ji, we also believe that it even has major shortcomings. Niu Niu could have been a living image of a victim, but she is ultimately a "preacher" who is controlled by the author's subjective intentions. Niu Xiang's "transformation" does not conform to the character logic of this type of character. The author's unrealistic attitude towards these two key figures seems to be all for the sake of "happy reunion." These are all "dross." This makes a play with the most human touch end up with the most inhuman ending.

A work is realistic because its author dares to face reality and reflects the social contradictions of the time. The Pipa Ji is true in its main aspects and the creative methods that embody these contents. But as a playwright, Gao Zecheng also has his contradictions. The famous "not related to social morals, even if it is good, it is in vain" has been regarded as his only creative view. But even in terms of his "view of social morals," there are still contradictions. Cai Bojie's "life's wish," Zhao Wuniang's "righteousness of sharing weal and woe," and the view of human relations of Cai Gongpo after the tragedy of sharing disasters all stand in opposition to the "three not following" dogmas and systems. This is an effective factor that makes this tragedy win in thought and art, and forms its moving content. But on the other hand, he has to ask for help from Niu Niu's preaching, Niu Xiang's transformation, and even the "commendation of the whole family." As far as Wuniang's "poem of truth" is concerned, the so-called "tell the green cloud guest, be careful not to violate the laws of nature," here, the contradiction between "being an official" and "being a man" is considered to be resolvable, as long as "be careful not to violate" it will be fine. This is precisely the contradiction of the author's world view. But as a historical phenomenon, this is also a destined contradiction. Gao Zecheng revealed the contradictions between this system, ethics, and life itself, but he could not find any reasonable way to resolve this contradiction. Because that can only be a matter after feudal society. Helpless, he had to return to the contradiction itself. In this way, of course, it also led to contradictions in his creative methods. On the one hand, the invincible realistic spirit made him sing out moving poems "flowing from the human heart," making him dare to say again and again "what to do if the monarch refuses to follow," and sing out curses for the tragedy caused by this system and its ethics. On the other hand, the shackles and spiritual closure of feudal society did not provide any conditions for resolving the contradiction he experienced; therefore, this also made him "trivial and unbearable to watch" when he should have gone straight down the river, and the ending of a masterpiece finally had to become "the end of a strong crossbow" (Xu Fuzuo: "On Qu").

Despite this, it after all reflects the major issues of fundamental nature that existed in the long period of China's feudal era. It should be considered one of China's important realistic dramas. Precisely for this reason, we dare to propose discussions and ask for corrections from comrades who disagree with this view.

    琵琶记论辩
    许之乔
    琵琶记，如过去许多作品一样，是有它的限度和缺点的。但如果仅从它的“宣言”，或者，根据毛声山辈的意见而认定它是宣扬封建道德的，那就忽视了这部作品的复杂性。琵琶记写的是封建“五伦关系”，但如从它的戏剧冲突的整个发展形势中去理解它所反映的社会矛盾的话，那么，它客观上所达到的，不是什么“五伦全备”，而是这些伦常关系与实际生活之间的矛盾。从这里着眼，我们应该肯定它的意义。
    蔡伯喈的道路，他所面临的冲突，他的精神状态，都体现了这一矛盾。一开始，他所接触的，就已经是两种不同生活观的矛盾：蔡公所相信的“论做人要光前耀后，劝我儿青云万里早当驰骤”，是与蔡婆的“真乐在田园，何必区区公与侯”，和伯喈夫妇的“万两黄金未为贵，一家安乐值钱多”的生活愿望相对立的。而这，正是全剧基本矛盾的端倪。并且这一矛盾是有社会性的，因为，它导因于社会制度。蔡公这种“你若锦衣归故里，我便死呵，一灵儿终是喜”的天真向往，正是长期流毒于人们心中的社会思想。这是与封建统治阶级那种“孝始于事亲，中于事君，终于立身”的伦理观相结合的。而蔡伯喈的“甘守清贫，力行孝道”，是与蔡公此时的“伦理”相冲突的；更有蔡婆和五娘，他们当然也跳不出封建伦理范围以外；高则诚也诚然是“呵护”他们，同情他们的。但他所揭露的，却正是这种符合生活要求的伦理，与此时蔡张二公那种“倘得脱白挂绿……这才是忠孝双全”的伦理之间的矛盾。在这种思想支配下，蔡公“不要儿子做人，只要儿子做官”（李卓吾），并使蔡伯喈“勉强赴春闱”以后，被迫陷入更深的矛盾中。
    蔡伯喈确实走上了许多士大夫们梦寐以求的“理想”的道路，但问题却在于：高则诚写的是“三不从琵琶记”，而蔡伯喈也感慨于“三被强，我衷肠事说与谁行？”父亲、皇帝、丞相的意旨，和赴试、做官、乘龙快婿这条道路正是“鹏程万里”的绝妙门径，但这却违背了他的合理愿望，所以他叫做“三被强”。这显然是两种不同观念的矛盾。他就是这种制度与观念支配下的悲剧性人物。而高则诚所写的，不是这一标准方向的礼赞，而是它的矛盾的反映。正是在这条“理想的道路”上所造成的矛盾，贯串全剧，并因此而产生了更大的生活与伦理的悲剧。这才是琵琶记戏剧性冲突的基本内容。
    对于蔡伯喈来说，这一冲突，表现在“鳌头可羡，须知富贵非吾愿”，“春宴杏园”时，他对于家乡的思念中；也表现于他在知道“议婚”之前，就想“辞官”的打算中。尽管如此，要是坚持下去，必然要“激怒当朝”。这不仅是由于牛太师的“敢和我厮挺相持”的“牛性”，更使得“当朝”“激怒”的是这一无以了之的既成形势。那相府中的姥姥说得对：“非爹胡缠，怕被人传。道你是相府公侯女，不能够嫁状元。”何况，这是皇帝看中了他这个好才学的好人物而来“金口说合”呢？可见，这已不只是牛相的个人性格脾气，而是从“金口”到“相府公侯”的意志声名之不可轻犯与动摇。环境、制度、观念，以及此时此地的实际形势，对于初出茅庐的蔡伯喈来说，是不容易了解的。他还满以为“甘旨不供，我食禄有愧”，“不告父母，怎谐匹配”，这些“忠心孝义得全美”的大道理，皇帝也无法否定的。但，正如陈继儒所说：“秀才那里识王法！”当“圣旨”下了，他还以为也指望是黄门官“哄”他，还天真地希望黄门官能与他“再去奏知官里：我情愿不做官！”甚至慌得（陆钞“元本”此处多“荒介”。）要“自去拜还圣旨”。直到黄门官告他“圣旨谁敢违背”，“这里不是闹吵去处”，他才明白：“闪杀人”的，是这“一封丹凤诏”！
    如果说，“被亲强来赴选场”，是由于“为尽子情，难拒亲命”；那么，“被君强官为议郎，被婚强效鸾凰”，是由于“尊君命”：“孝道虽大，终于事君”。而这种“伦理”，是从朝廷，而社会，而家内乃至媒婆、姥姥、黄门官都视之为“人所常由之道”的，但却与实际生活发生了矛盾。正是这一共同思想成为贯串全剧的支配力量，使得蔡伯喈被陷于“摆不脱功名奈何，送将来冤家怎躲”的矛盾中。而这也就产生了他的第一次怨恨：“家乡万里信难通，争奈君王不肯从！”这就是使得他“行亏名缺”的根本原因。这显然不是什么“歌功颂德”。不错，过去时代士大夫们望眼欲穿的“恩宠”，算是集中于他一身了，然而，他的“幸运”，正是他的不幸。悲剧，不仅产生于人身的被束缚，同时也产生于精神的被压抑。“细思之，此事岂吾意欲？”“兀的东床，难叫我坦腹！”而形成这一恶果的，是“不合来长安看花”，是“君王不肯从”，是那封闪杀人的“丹凤诏”。而这种怨恨，正是贯串他心灵的主要思想。且不论这是不是作者的有意识安排，客观上，蔡伯喈的伦理观与成为支配力量的这条“理想道路”上的伦理观的对立，是通过“三被强”的矛盾而明确地表现出来了。
    但他的矛盾，苦恼，怨恨还不止于此。三年官邸生活，他只是“不明不暗”，“面带忧容”的。所以如此，就因为他被强置于那所谓“美景”中而实际上是一种“战兢兢怕犯法”的生活，更因“老相公之势，炙手可热”，以至于设法寄一封家书，还得和院子商量。他与牛女，也只是“好姻缘翻做恶姻缘”，“夫妻且说三分话，未可全抛一片心”的。这就使得他只好在矛盾中讨生活：一方面，也难免没有那“新弦”与“旧弦”的矛盾；另一方面，他始终没忘记那“幼读文章，论事亲为子也须要成模样”的伦理观。这一切的痛苦和烦恼集中地表现在第三十七出那段通过自我谴责而发出的有名的诅咒中。宾白中已说明：“当元俺父母教我读诗书，知孝义，谁知道反被诗书误了我。”这也就是所谓“毕竟是文章误我，我误爹娘”，“文章误我，我误妻房”。这种诅咒，正和“倒不如严子陵登钓台”一样，又是与“少什么不识字的，倒得终奉养”，“倒不如守义终身田舍郎”这种思想相联系的。
    诗书，在封建时代，一般都视之为纲常名教的法典。它本身也可当作封建教义的同义语。而蔡伯喈，他是从知事时起便从诗书中吸取教养，接受观念，他的生活观，不可能跳
  出封建伦常之外，而且他还是一个颇为诚朴的信奉者。他“辞试”，“辞官”，“辞婚”也正是由于他有着这一伦理观。但另一方面，其所以“三不从”，却也正是由于“始于事亲，中于事君，终于立身”这一同一体系，并且是不可动摇的伦理观。问题便在这里：正是从父到君的这一共同的伦理观念，迫使他走向那符合于这一伦常的“理想”道路，而也就是这一伦常，这一道路，造成了他的悲剧。琵琶记的基本矛盾，便根源于此。发展开来，更造成他全家的悲剧。因此，正如“书馆悲逢”伯喈夫妇的下场所说：“只为君亲三不从，致令骨肉两西东”，这才是造成这一悲剧恶果的根本原因。
    在这里，或如李卓吾无意中说出的“做官”与“做人”的矛盾。但问题仍在于：“三不从”以及他的不得不“从”，都由于这同一体系的伦理观：他三“辞”，是由于“力行孝道”，是由于“糟糠之妻不下堂”，是由于他不愿“行亏名缺”。而他“三被强”，却又是由于这一制度及其伦理所规定了的尊亲命与尊君命。忠与孝，做官与做人，原是在这种伦理要求下，被统一起来的理想的方向：做官才算得做人，这既是“立身”，又是“事君”与“事亲”。而他果然青云直上，也并未改变他的初衷。但正由于走上了这条道路，却又违背了这一伦理，负却了他在这一伦理指导之下的“平生愿”：他有亏于孝，无意于忠，也算不得立身。他无力也不可能解决这一矛盾。因此，这也就形成了他的精神悲剧。这终究是封建制度及其伦理本身所决定了的。因为，在社会，家庭中生了根的，为巩固这一制度的种种伦常，却正好与实际生活及其合理要求相矛盾，当然，这其间也有着元代文人被压抑着而又找不到出路的共同感情。但主要的是曲折地反映了这一伦理及其制度之不能自圆其说的矛盾，它的“道路”与生活之间的种种不可解决的矛盾。
    伦常及其制度问题，是我国封建社会整个漫长时期带有根本性质的重大问题。如果琵琶记就其主要方面，并且特别是以蔡伯喈这样一个走上“人所共羡”的“美景”中的悲剧人物为主题线索，在十四世纪社会历史的限制下，而尽其所能地真实地反映了封建社会制度本身、伦理本身与现实生活间的种种矛盾，那么，它就反映了一个重大的社会矛盾。琵琶记客观的社会意义，也就在这里。因此，尽管它有其矛盾与缺点，但就这一形象的意义而言，我们过去对他的估价，不是过高，而是过低了。
    对于赵五娘，人们同样也各有褒贬。明清以来，在士大夫笔下，她是被称为“孝妇，贤妇，圣妇”的。现在，也有人以为，高则诚正是以这一“标准贤人”，来进行他“有裨风化”的宣传的。不可否认，作者是以他的全部同情歌颂了这一女性，也不可否认，在她身上，如果没有那封建时代的思想感情，那也是无法想像的。但问题却在于：如此“人贤”，是否“事美”。她与她的公婆，在怎样的社会与生活矛盾中，遭受着怎样的命运。
    最初，赵五娘唯一的“向往”，只不过是“惟愿取偕老夫妻，长侍奉暮年姑舅”。但“逼试”之后，蔡伯喈事在必行，而“万里关山”，“八十岁父母教谁看管？”的许多实际问题都堆在她身上了，她的性格才起了变化。他夫妇是在“为爹泪涟，为娘泪涟，何曾为着夫妻上挂牵。”虽然如此，他“爹行”却“不从几谏”，乃至爹娘来时，还得“且揾了眼泪。”这也就是说：她还得掩饰她的辛酸。“这其间，又怎教人不悲怨？”——这是细节。然而，那怕就是这一瞬间，也反映了贯串于全剧的，那制度、伦理与生活间的，以及它们自身的矛盾。正是在这一刹那的戏剧冲突中所掀起的种种矛盾里，我们看到了潜藏在赵五娘内心深处的精神世界的第一次闪光。这里，也正酝酿着她的矛盾。一方面，“悲岂断弦，愁非分镜。只虑高堂，风烛不定”；一方面，“我做媳妇事舅姑不待你言，你做孩儿离父母何日还？”一方面，她的“衷肠事有万千”，“说来又恐添萦绊”；一方面，“我的埋冤怎尽言，我的一身难上难。”而我们正从她的不敢埋冤的埋冤中，看到了她的善良，她的观念，和她的被压抑的心情。但这在中世纪，对于我国普通妇女来说，它既是普遍的，又多半是埋藏在内心深处的孤独的心情。因此，当她那“指望与他同事双亲，偕老百年”这种最简单的愿望被破灭以后，她的“感叹”，越是不能诉之于人前的，就越有它的普遍意义。因此，当她的这些埋怨，愁烦，忧虑，一转而为：“既受托了苹繁，有甚推辞。索性做个孝妇贤妻，也落得名标青史，今日啊，不枉受了些闲凄楚，嗏，俺这里自支吾，休得污了他的名儿，左右与他相回护”时，这里正有着她不得不的牺牲和痛苦。而毕竟是她，承担了生活的全部重担和灾难。而这，也正是封建社会所规定了的赵五娘们的悲剧命运。
    这一形象，既造型于十四世纪，在她的伦理与生活观中，就不可能脱离开封建时代及其制度支配下的思想意识。她也确实生活在封建社会及其家庭不可或缺的等级关系与观念中，而她也正是这样对待她的公婆丈夫的。尽管如此，或者，也可以说：唯其如此，她的“衷肠事”才有“万千”，而她的一身也就更加“难上难”了。这里，正有着她的悲剧。因此，几百年来，这一形象之所以能够“家喻户晓”，不在于那孤零零的孝与贤的概念，主要的在于她在她的处境中所作的牺牲，和她那对待生活的纯真精神。如果说，那一伦常及其制度本身造成了蔡伯喈的生活与伦理的悲剧，那么，另一直接结果，便是赵五娘及其公婆的悲惨遭遇。如果说，封建伦常关系及其观念，形成了蔡伯喈“做人”与“做官”的矛盾，这道路，这制度，造成了他的“行亏名缺”，那么，在赵五娘及其公婆整个生活悲剧的发展过程中，我们所看到的，也正是被支配于这样的伦常关系与观念中的，这些“良善之人”（蔡公语，第十七出）的悲剧。如果说，这一家人的悲剧，都导源于因果相关的同一矛盾，那么，承受这一悲剧的最大压力的，却是赵五娘。因为她肩负着媳妇和儿子的双重重担。她要“事奉舅姑”，这就是说，她生活在公婆媳这一等级关系及其观念之中，并且还生活在公婆间的矛盾里。她要“养家活口”，以一个封建时代的妇女，她更躬逢着那家庭以外的天灾人祸。她承担了全部生活，因而人们在她的悲剧精神中，看到了许多古代妇女共同的历史命运。她的悲剧体现了一种可歌可泣、激发人们的同情和愤慨的思想情绪。
    如果说，蔡公与蔡婆的矛盾，是由于“没事为着功名，不要他供甘旨，你教他做官，要改换门闾，只怕他做官时你做鬼……相连累我孩儿因你做不得好名儒”；如果说，赵五娘与她公婆的矛盾，是由于她不得不规定在封建伦常的等级关系与观念中，而她面对着天灾人祸，又不得不忍饥受饿的肩负着“公婆命所关”的责任与义务；那么，这一家人“三年间没一个饱暖的日子”，这一家人的惨痛悲剧，也都导源于贯串全剧的总矛盾中。“叹当初是我不是，不如我死了无他虑”（第十一出）；“我当初不寻思，教孩儿往帝都，把媳妇闪得苦又孤，把婆婆送入黄泉路，算来是我相担误，不如我死，免得把你再辜负”（第二十一出）；蔡公在各个凄惨经历后的这种沉痛自责，在没有明白“当初只道蔡伯喈贪名逐利，不肯回家，元来被人逗留在此”（第三十六出，五娘语）之前，仿佛是针对着蔡伯喈，在明白了“只为君亲三不从，致令骨肉两西东”之后，那么，它的锋芒所指，也正针对着造成这一悲剧的社会矛盾的蔡公自己，也是个初被麻醉而终于痛悔的牺牲者。因此，这一对公婆的悲剧形象，在整个戏剧冲突的发展形势中，也表现了与它的基本矛盾相关联的主题意义。同样，“苦只苦赵五娘辛勤妇”，她在这一悲剧艺术结构中的作用，就不只是简单的从“场面”的交替上，理解为“一贫一富”的对比。这将会减低了琵琶记的意义，而这也是从忽视了蔡伯喈在他的悲剧道路中所发出的诅咒和愤慨而来的。对于蔡公婆，特别是蔡伯喈，作者显然是既同情而又以人物的自我谴责，来进行对他们的批判的。但对五娘，他同情她的遭际，也歌颂她的心灵——这其间，当然也歌颂了她的伦理感情。但，蔡伯喈既然是“倒不如守义终身田舍郎”，那么，赵五娘这一形象在艺术结构中的对比作用，就说明了真正出自纯真心灵的“义”，只在“糟糠”，只在民间，而不在通向“富贵功名”，通向官方的那条“理想”道路上！尽管作者及其女主角的伦理情绪不能跳出中世纪的历史限制，但这对统治阶级支配着因而也是麻醉着人们的那种种伦常来说，是不利的，对立的。何况，她只是个被封建伦常支配着，而不得不肩负着一切生活患难的人，因此也是个被牺牲者。如果说，蔡伯喈的抒情，流露了他的愤懑，那么，在她的“难穷尽的珠泪”后面，正有着无数的“潜台词”：她“索性做个”，“左右与他”，但她毕竟是“千辛万苦皆经历，苦人吃着苦味，两苦相逢，可知道欲吞不去。”她吃着苦味，便使公婆“埋冤杀我，我也不敢分说。”但是，“我千辛万苦，有甚疑猜？可不道我脸儿黄瘦骨如柴！”当蔡公写下遗嘱，考虑到“你若不嫁人，恐非活计，若不守孝，又被人谈议”的时候，一方面，她说是“公公严命，非奴敢违”；另一方面，她又相信，若是嫁人，“只怕再如伯喈，却不误了我一世。”这真是伤心人的观点。这犹如说：嫁谁也都是一样的命运。而这，也正是被历史所注定了的命运。“非奴苦要孝名传，正是上山擒虎易，开口告人难”。“头发，是我担阁你度青春，如今又剪你资送老亲。”“公公，你图他折桂看花早，不想自把一身送在白杨衰草……这苦凭谁告？”她的苦恼怨恨，总是通过这种不得已的曲折方式而表露出来。正是在这里，我们看到了她内心深处的“她自己”。从她身上，我们看到了一个过去时代普通妇女的心灵。她的典型意义，也就在这里：她的性格，体现着古代人民性格，而她的悲剧历史，也正是我国古代社会千千万万“荆钗布裙”的历史。
    正如不能一笔抹杀琵琶记的现实内容一样，我们也认为：它甚至是有着重大缺点的。牛女本可以是个有生命的被牺牲者的形象，但被作者主观意图所左右，终于是个“说教者”。牛相的“转变”，是不合乎这类人物的性格逻辑的。作者对待这两个关键性人物的非现实主义态度，似乎，又都为着“大团圆”。这都是“糟粕”。这就使得一部最有人情味的戏，落得个最不人情的收场了。
    一部作品之所以是现实主义的，就因为它的作者，敢于面对现实，并反映了当时的社会矛盾。琵琶记就其主要方面以及体现这些内容的创作方法而言，是真实的。但作为剧作家的高则诚，也有他的矛盾。有名的“不关风化体，纵好也徒然”，曾被当作他唯一的创作观。但就以他的“风化观”而论，也还是有其矛盾的。蔡伯喈的“平生愿”，赵五娘的“糟糠之义”，以及蔡公婆在共灾难的悲剧之后的人伦观，都与那“三不从”的教条与制度相对立的。这是使得这一悲剧从思想到艺术赢得胜利的有效因素，并形成了它的动人内容。但另一方面，他又不得不求救于牛女的说教，牛相的转变，乃至“一门旌奖”的那一和解。就以五娘的“题真诗”而言，所谓“寄语青云客，慎勿乖天彝”，这里，“做官”与“做人”的矛盾，被认为可以解决，只要“慎勿乖”便行。这正是作者世界观的矛盾。但作为历史现象，这也是命定了的矛盾。高则诚揭露了这一制度，伦理与生活及其本身的矛盾，但他不可能找到解决这一矛盾的任何合理的途径。因为，那只能够是封建社会以后的事。无可奈何，他又不得不回到矛盾本身中去了。这样，当然也导致了他在创作方法上的矛盾。一方面，无往不胜的现实主义精神，使他歌唱出“从人心流出”的动人诗篇，使他敢于再三说出“争奈君王不肯从”，唱出对于这一制度及其伦理所造成的悲剧的诅咒。另一方面，封建社会的梏桎与精神闭塞，没有提供解决他体会到的这一矛盾的任何条件；因此，这也就使得他在应该顺流直下时，却反而“琐碎不堪观”，一部杰作的收场，终于不得不成为“强弩之末”了（徐复祚：“曲论”）。
    尽管如此，它毕竟反映了我国封建时代长时期内所存在的，带有根本性质的重大问题。它应该被认为是我国现实主义重要剧作之一。正因如此，我们才敢于提出商榷，并就正于不同意这一看法的同志们。
