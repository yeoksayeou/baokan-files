Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, September 1st: The Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway project, which is being built in the vast Gobi Desert, has received strong support from all sides. Now, vehicles bearing the names "Qinghai-Tibet Highway Administration," "Qinghai Petroleum Exploration Bureau," "Yumen Mining Bureau," "Xinjiang Transportation Bureau," and "Jiuquan Transportation Company" are constantly transporting construction materials, daily necessities, and potable water to the construction site. The ox-cart and horse-cart teams organized by farmers in the Hexi Corridor are also successively heading to the construction site to support the road construction.

In order to support the construction of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway, the people of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region have specially built a motor road near Hami to transport large quantities of timber produced in the deep mountains to the railway line. The Uygur people have also expanded their vegetable planting area this year, supplying millions of catties of fruits and vegetables to the road construction workers in the Gobi Desert. The materials supply department of Hami Prefecture has also organized working groups to go deep into the Gobi Desert road construction sites to understand the living needs of the workers in order to better supply the daily necessities needed by the road construction workers. Farmers in Anxi, Yumen, and other counties in Gansu Province have also transported hundreds of pigs and sheep for the road construction workers.

In the Hongliu River area at the junction of Gansu and Xinjiang, hundreds of Uygur workers are digging reservoirs and building transport access roads. This is a civilian labor team organized by the people of Xinjiang to support road construction. Supporting the road construction project in the Gobi Desert are also workers from Hebei, Shanghai, and other parts of Gansu; thousands of veterans from Zhejiang and Shandong have also volunteered to come to the Gobi Desert to participate in the construction.

In addition, the Xinhua Bookstore, the Post and Telecommunications Bureau, and the People's Bank of Gansu Province have sent mobile working groups to serve the road construction workers in the Gobi Desert.

    戈壁滩上筑路工程得到各方面支援
    新华社兰州1日电　在大戈壁上修筑的兰新铁路工程，得到各方面的大力支援。现在，写着“青藏公路管理局”、“青海石油勘探局”、“玉门矿务局”、“新疆运输局”、“酒泉运输公司”字样的支援筑路的汽车，川流不息地把筑路器材、日用品和生活用水运到施工现场；河西走廊农民组织的牛车队和马车队，也陆续前往工地支援筑路。
    新疆维吾尔自治区人民为了支援兰新铁路的建设，在哈密附近专门修了一条汽车路，把深山里出产的大批木材运到铁路线上来。维吾尔族人民今年还扩大了种菜面积，把增产的数百万斤瓜果蔬菜，源源供给戈壁滩上的筑路工人。哈密专区物资供应部门还组织了工作组，深入戈壁滩筑路工地了解职工的生活需要，以便更好地供应筑路职工需要的生活用品。甘肃省安西、玉门等县的农民，也为筑路工人运来了数百头猪、羊。
    在甘肃和新疆交界地方的红柳河一带，有数百个维吾尔族工人在挖蓄水池和修运输便道，这是新疆人民自动组织的支援筑路的民工队。支援大戈壁上筑路工程的，还有河北、上海和甘肃各地来的工人；数千名浙江、山东的复员军人，也自愿到戈壁滩上来参加建设。
    此外，甘肃省的新华书店、邮电局和人民银行，派出了流动工作组，为戈壁滩上的筑路职工服务。
