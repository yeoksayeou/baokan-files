Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 7th: Relevant units across the country are actively supporting the construction of the Pingdingshan Coal Mine. By the end of August, the Kailuan Coal Mine had already transferred more than 360 technical cadres, management cadres, technicians, and medical personnel to the future Pingdingshan Coal Mine. Among them, 137 technicians and a group of medical personnel were drawn by the Kailuan Coal Mine from outside the personnel transfer plan to support the construction of Pingdingshan. Many technical cadres and management cadres familiar with the business have actively formulated plans to help cultivate new forces after arriving in Pingdingshan, actively helping transferred cadres to become familiar with the business; and giving technical lessons to newly recruited students and signing apprenticeship contracts with them. The Kailuan Coal Mine also helped Pingdingshan Coal Mine train 308 technicians, and will continue to send a large number of cadres to Pingdingshan Coal Mine in the future.

From Qiqihar in the Northeast to Kunming in the Southwest, eighty-three machinery factories in fifteen provinces are manufacturing mining machinery and equipment such as hoisting, ventilation, drainage, and excavation for the Pingdingshan Coal Mine under construction. Most of the various mechanical equipment produced by various places for Pingdingshan this year are new or products that have never been produced in our country. The Jixi Mining Machinery Factory is manufacturing the Donbass "1" type combined coal mining machine for the Pingdingshan No. 4 Mine, which is expected to be delivered in December. Although the Anshan Plumbing Factory has heavy production tasks, the two boilers undertaken were completed two months ahead of schedule, ensuring timely installation. The large winch undertaken by the Fushun Heavy Machinery Factory is technically complex and has a large body, and it was also delivered three months ahead of schedule in June. The Shanghai Metal Processing Factory's production tasks for this year have been fully scheduled, and in order to support key construction, the factory has also accepted the task of manufacturing cast steel parts for the Pingdingshan mining area.

At present, more than half of the mechanical equipment undertaken by various places has been transported to the mining area. After technical appraisal and inspection, most of these equipments meet the quality requirements.

Three thousand employees who participated in the construction of the Dongshan, Xing'an Tai, or Xieji Ji shaft projects will go to the Pingdingshan mining area to accept new mine construction tasks. Most of the hundreds of engineering and technical personnel and two thousand five hundred mine construction workers in this mine construction team have more than three years of experience in building modern large shafts. The first batch of cadres supporting the construction of Pingdingshan, led by Li Hua, deputy director of the former Northeast Second Mine Construction Bureau, arrived in the Pingdingshan mining area as early as mid-August. Most of the remaining employees will arrive in the mining area in batches from the Northeast and Huainan areas at the end of the third quarter and the beginning of the fourth quarter. This batch of mine construction forces, combined with the existing mine construction forces in the Pingdingshan mining area, and appropriately expanding a batch of new workers, can undertake the construction of six pairs of large shafts at the same time. Many of the employees who will go to Pingdingshan are labor models and advanced producers. Among them are Shen Sufeng, an excellent female air compressor operator who participated in the National Conference of Advanced Producers' Representatives.

### 全国各地支援平顶山矿井建设

    全国各地支援平顶山矿井建设
    新华社郑州7日电　全国各地有关单位正在积极支援平顶山煤矿的建设工程。到8月底，开滦煤矿已经给未来的平顶山煤矿输送了三百六十多名技术干部、管理干部和技术工人、医务人员。其中，一百三十七名技术工人和一批医务人员，是开滦煤矿为支援平顶山的建设从人员调动计划以外抽调出来的。很多技术干部和业务熟悉的管理干部，在来到平顶山以后，都主动制定了帮助培养新生力量的计划，积极帮助转业干部熟悉业务；并给新招收的学员上技术课，和他们订立师徒合同。开滦煤矿还帮助平顶山煤矿培养三百零八名技术工人，今后将继续选派大批干部输送给平顶山煤矿。
    从东北的齐齐哈尔到西南的昆明，十五个省的八十三个机械厂正在为建设中的平顶山煤矿制造提升、通风、排水、采掘等矿山机械设备。今年各地为平顶山生产的各种机械设备，大多是新型的或我国从未生产过的产品。鸡西矿山机械厂正在为平顶山四矿制造顿巴斯
  “1”型联合采煤机，预计在12月份交货。鞍山水暖厂承制的两台锅炉，虽然厂内生产任务繁重，但是仍然提前两个月制成，保证了按时安装。抚顺重型机器厂承制的大型绞车，技术复杂，机体庞大，也提前三个月在6月份交了货。上海市金属加工厂今年的生产任务已经排满，厂里为了支援重点建设，也接受了为平顶山矿区制造铸钢零件的任务。
    现在，各地承制的机械设备有半数以上运到了矿区，这些设备经过技术鉴定和检查，大部分质量合乎要求。
    曾经参加建设东山、兴安台或谢家集竖井工程的三千名职工，将到平顶山矿区接受新的矿井建设任务。这支建井队伍中的上百名工程技术人员和二千五百名建井工人，大部分都有三年以上建设现代化大型竖井的经验。由前东北第二建井局副局长李桦带领的第一批支援平顶山建设的干部，早在8月中旬就到达平顶山矿区。其余大部分职工将在第三季度末和第四季度初，从东北和淮南地区分批来到矿区。这批建井力量和平顶山矿区现有的建井力量配合起来，再适当扩充一批新工人，就可以同时承建六对大型竖井的建设工程。将到平顶山的这批职工，有许多人是劳动模范和先进生产者。其中有参加过全国先进生产者代表会议的优秀女压风机手沈素芬等。
