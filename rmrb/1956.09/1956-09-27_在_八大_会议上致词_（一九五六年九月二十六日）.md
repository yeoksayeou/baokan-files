Speech at the Eighth National Congress
(September 26, 1956)
Song Qingling

Dear comrades!

First, please allow me to extend my most sincere and warmest congratulations to the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China and to all the comrades participating in this congress. Congratulations on the brilliant achievements you have made in the revolutionary struggles of every past stage.

Comrades, as a non-Communist Party member, I feel it is the most glorious and pleasant thing in my life to be able to attend this historically significant congress.

For the past ten days, I have been attending here, listening to the reports of great significance, listening to the speeches of our foreign friends, and listening to the important speeches of many comrades. I have been greatly encouraged, and I cannot help but want to say a few words here.

After decades of painful lessons, the Chinese people, under the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China, quickly freed themselves from the shackles of imperialism, eliminated feudalism, and achieved a decisive victory in the socialist revolution. After two revolutions, we have overthrown the exploitative system of man eating man and stood up. This has once again set up a great milestone in the course of human history. We must thank the Communist Party for its continuous struggle for the cause of human liberation. Without the leadership of the Party, our victory would not have been possible.

History is created by the people. Based on this principle, the Communist Party of China has consistently implemented the leadership of the mass line. It unites the masses, educates the masses, listens to the opinions of the masses, seeks welfare for the people, and never separates itself from the masses. Under the banner of patriotism, the Communist Party of China united all democratic parties and established a united front and a coalition government. It used the power of this state power to eliminate counter-revolutionaries, restore the national economy, and pave the way for the construction of a socialist society. That is to say, relying on the people's democratic power, it continued to achieve victory after victory from one revolution to another. The Communist Party of China has led us to peacefully build a socialist society.

Our socialist construction has won the enthusiastic support of the broad masses of people in the world; at the same time, it has been hated and obstructed by counter-revolutionaries. At present, there is still the Chiang Kai-shek clique entrenched in Taiwan; and there are imperialist aggressive forces headed by belligerent groups abroad. We must be vigilant against these counter-revolutionaries, strengthen our dictatorship, and smash their conspiracies. At the same time, we must continue to unite the peace-loving people of foreign countries, give play to the role of cultural exchanges, develop equal and mutually beneficial trade, and expand the spirit of consultation and cooperation to the whole world.

The advanced agricultural producers' cooperatives, which are currently continuing to develop, have already changed the land ownership system. The joint state-private enterprises, which are continuing to develop, have fundamentally changed the capital ownership system. State-owned enterprises and various cooperatives are laying the foundation for our socialist society. However, in order to effectively and quickly coordinate with our new social and economic relations and new production relations, we must strengthen our own ideological education. Old brains cannot handle new undertakings well. Backward ideas will not create new relationships. Corrupt habits only destroy progressive systems. Without patriotic education, it is difficult to complete the tasks of state-owned enterprises. If the concept of individualism is not eliminated, it is difficult to achieve the goals of cooperatives. In the future, our work in the field of ideological education will definitely be arduous and heavy. The increasingly high tide of socialist competition, the blossoming of a hundred flowers in literary and artistic work, and the contention of a hundred schools of thought in scientific work are opening up a bright and brilliant road. We should continue to intensify our efforts in these areas.

Our recent achievements are a great encouragement to us. Dear comrades! A society with classes and exploitation has existed on this planet for more than five thousand years. But in the thirty-five years since the founding of the Communist Party of China, a large part of humanity has broken away from the shackles of imperialism and embarked on the road of socialism. I firmly believe that in the near future, socialism will become a common social system throughout the world. By then, undoubtedly, a classless and non-exploitative society will be even more universal, and mankind will enter a truly great world of communism. Therefore, I think that this kind of social system can only be realized under the leadership of the Communist Party, and it will surely be realized.

Finally, please allow me to once again express my gratitude and high respect to the great Communist Party dedicated to the cause of human liberation, and wish the congress a complete success!

    在“八大”会议上致词
    （一九五六年九月二十六日）
    宋庆龄亲爱的同志们！
    首先请允许我向中国共产党第八次代表大会和参加这次大会的全体同志，表示最衷心和最热烈的祝贺。祝贺你们在过去的每一个阶段的革命斗争中所取得的辉煌成就。
    同志们，像我这样一个非共产党员，能够列席这次具有历史意义的大会，这是我毕生中感到最光荣和最愉快的事。
    十天来，我在这里列席，听到了富有重大意义的报告，听到了诸位外国朋友的致词，听到了很多同志的重要发言。我受到很大的鼓舞，禁不住也想在这里讲几句话。
    中国人民积了几十年惨痛的经验教训，终于在中国共产党正确的领导下，很快地解脱了帝国主义的束缚，消灭了封建主义，取得了社会主义革命的决定性的胜利。经过两次革命，我们已经推翻了那人吃人的剥削制度而站立起来。这在人类历史的进程中，再一次树立了一个伟大的里程碑。我们要感谢不断为人类解放事业而奋斗的共产党。没有党的领导，我们的胜利是不可能的。
    历史是人民所创造的。中国共产党根据这一原则，一贯地实行群众路线的领导。它团结群众，教育群众，听取群众的意见，为人民谋福利，从不脱离群众。中国共产党在爱国主义的旗帜下，联合所有民主党派，建立了联合阵线和联合政府。它运用这个国家政权的力量，肃清了反革命分子，恢复了国民经济，为建设社会主义社会铺平了道路。就是说，凭借了人民民主政权，继续不断地从一个革命的胜利达到另一个革命的胜利。中国共产党领导了我们，和平地建设一个社会主义的社会。
    我们的社会主义建设事业，获得了世界上广大人民的热情的支持；同时也受到反革命分子的仇视和阻挠。现在在国内还有盘据台湾的蒋介石集团；在国外还有以好战集团为首的帝国主义侵略势力。对这些反革命分子应当提高警惕，加强我们的专政，粉碎他们的阴谋。同时，我们要继续不断地团结国外爱好和平的人民，发挥文化交流的作用，发展平等互利的贸易，把协商和合作的精神扩充到整个世界。
    目前正在继续发展中的高级农业生产合作社，已经把土地所有制改变了。正在继续发展中的公私合营的企业，已经把资本所有制基本上改变了。国营事业和各种合作社，更在那里打下我们社会主义社会的基础。但为有效地、迅速地配合我们新的社会经济关系、新的生产关系起见，我们必须加强我们自己的思想教育，旧脑筋是不能办好新事业的。落后的思想不会创造新的关系。腐败的习惯只是破坏进步的制度。没有爱国主义的教育，就很难完成国营企业的任务。个人主义的观念不消除，就很难达到合作社的目的。今后我们在思想教育领域内的工作，一定是很艰巨而繁重。目前日益高涨的社会主义竞赛，文艺工作的百花齐放，科学工作的百家争鸣，正在开辟着一条光辉灿烂的道路。我们应当在这些方面不断加紧努力。
    我们最近获得的成就，对我们说来，是一个莫大的鼓励。亲爱的同志们！有阶级有剥削的社会，在这个星球上已经存在着五千多年了。但在中国共产党建党以来三十五年间，很大一部分人类已经脱离了帝国主义的束缚而走上社会主义的道路。我深信在不久的将来，社会主义就会成为全世界的一种通行的社会制度。到那时，无疑地，无阶级无剥削的社会就更要普遍，人类也就要进入真正的大同世界。因此我想这种社会制度，只有在共产党的领导下才能实现，也一定会实现。
    最后请让我再一次对致力于人类解放事业的伟大的共产党表示感谢和崇高的敬意，并祝大会胜利成功！
