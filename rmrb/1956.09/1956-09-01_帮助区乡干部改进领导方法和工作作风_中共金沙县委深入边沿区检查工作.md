    To Help District and Township Cadres Improve Leadership Methods and Work Style
    The CCP Jinsha County Committee Conducts In-Depth Inspections in Marginal Areas

    (Our report) Beginning in mid-July, the CCP (Communist Party of China) Jinsha County Committee in Guizhou Province selected twelve members of the County Committee and forty-five heads of various departments to form six work groups, which went to the marginal districts and townships to inspect work. The County Committee is now taking measures to resolve the problems that were discovered during the inspections.

    After the work groups went to the marginal districts and townships, they changed their past generalized working methods. They adopted a method of holding fewer meetings, going out more, asking for fewer figures, and learning more about specific situations. They not only talked with key personnel but also conducted in-depth interviews with farmers. As a result, the work groups discovered many problems that they had not been able to learn about in meetings or from key personnel in the past. For example, after the Anlu District work group went to the marginal Xinhua Township, they visited forty-four peasant households and held small-scale discussion meetings in two weeks. The interviewees included members of minority nationalities, Han Chinese, farmers from all social strata, young people, women, and those with strong and weak labor power. Through individual interviews, the work group discovered that the county, district, and township cadres working in this township had serious bureaucratic work styles in their current leadership work. They could not go deeply into the masses, which made it impossible to solve many specific problems in their work, especially the production management problems of agricultural cooperatives. Coercion and commandism in their work were very serious, and many cadres were unwilling to do arduous and meticulous political and ideological education work. Instead, they used simple and crude methods to carry out their work. Many cadres did not care about the hardships of the masses. The cadres originally reported that no cooperative members in Xinhua Township were running out of food. However, the work group learned from the masses that eleven households had already run out of food. These problems have added many difficulties to production and the consolidation of the cooperatives. Taking manure collection in Xinhua Township as an example, the amount of manure collected was 40% less than in the same period last year, and some agricultural cooperatives even saw a 50% reduction.

    The problems discovered by the work groups have attracted great attention from the CCP Jinsha County Committee. The County Committee is currently starting to solve these problems by focusing on checking the guiding ideology in conjunction with current production. The first step is to change the leadership style of the county and district levels, go deep down to assist the cadres in the marginal districts and townships to improve their leadership methods, and promptly prepare for the autumn harvest and distribution, ensuring that 90% of the members of the agricultural cooperatives increase their income.

    帮助区乡干部改进领导方法和工作作风
    中共金沙县委深入边沿区检查工作
    本报讯　从7月中旬开始，中共贵州金沙县委抽调了十二名县委委员和各个部门的负责人四十五人，组成了六个工作组，分别深入到边沿区、乡检查工作。现在县委正采取措施着手解决检查出来的问题。
    各县委工作组深入到边沿区、乡以后，都改变了过去一般化的工作方法；采取了少开会，多下去，少要数字，多了解具体情况，不仅找骨干谈，而且深入访问农户的方法去进行工作。因而工作组也就发现了许多以往在会议上或在骨干中了解不到的问题。如安洛区工作组深入到边沿的新化乡后，在两个星期里便先后访问了四十四户的社员家庭，召开了小型座谈会。访问对象中有少数民族、汉族，有各阶层的农民，有青年、妇女，也有劳力强和劳力弱的社员。从个别访问中，工作组发现了在这个乡工作的县、区、乡三级干部，当前在领导工作中存在着严重的官僚主义作风，不能深入到群众中去，使工作中的许多具体问题，特别是农业合作社的生产管理问题，得不到很好的解决。工作中的强迫命令十分严重，许多干部不愿意去做艰苦细致的政治思想教育工作。而是以简单粗暴的方法去进行工作。许多干部不关心群众的疾苦。干部原来汇报说：新化乡没有断炊的社员。但工作组深入到群众中去了解，却发现有十一户社员已经断了炊。这些问题，已经给生产和社的巩固工作增加了许多困难。仅以新化乡的积肥来说，积肥数量要比去年同时期减少40％，部分农业合作社甚至减少50％。
    各工作组检查发现的问题，已引起了中共金沙县委的极大重视。县委目前正在从结合当前生产检查领导思想入手，积极着手进行解决。首先是转变县、区两级的领导作风，深入下去协助边沿区、乡的干部改进领导方法，及时作好秋收准备、秋收分配等工作，保证农业合作社90％的社员增加收入。
