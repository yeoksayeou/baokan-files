What We Saw in America
Xie Jialin
(Part 1)

Generally speaking, it's difficult for a person to have a comprehensive understanding of a country other than their own. This is because their experiences are often limited to the circles in which they live in that country. Therefore, the following personal impressions, with their inevitable limitations, are unavoidable.

Speaking of impressions, they not only have a geographical nature but also a temporal one. In other words, the initial superficial observation of things and the impressions gained after long-term experience are often vastly different.

When I first arrived in the United States in early 1947, China was on the eve of the collapse of the Kuomintang regime, with an extremely chaotic economy and the people living in dire poverty. They, on the other hand, due to the wartime overtime work, generally had more money in their hands, and the market presented a superficial prosperity. Seeing the streets full of cars, the colorful houses, and the crowded customers in department stores, I couldn't help but feel their economic stability and affluence.

    Lack of a Sense of Security in Life

But this initial impression didn't last long. Some facts experienced in life made me understand the unstable nature of the American economy. Regardless of whether the surface economic situation was rising or falling, the worry of economic panic never left the people's minds for a single day. Economics professors at school predicted the impending economic panic based on charts of cyclical changes in the American economy. Newspapers and magazines also frequently discussed this disturbing news. Whether the American national economy could safely recover from the abnormal wartime expansion to a normal state was the biggest concern of most people at the time. People around the age of fifty, having experienced the economic crisis of 1929, were naturally even more "shocked" and felt that life was not guaranteed. Due to the "Marshall Plan," the Korean War, and the Cold War, which is still ongoing, a severe economic crisis has been artificially delayed, but people are well aware that delaying it doesn't solve the problem. Moreover, the longer it is delayed, the greater the future fluctuations will be. Under such circumstances, the people's psychology is constantly threatened. Because the installment buying system is prevalent in the United States, a large part of people's material enjoyment is prepaid. Their houses, cars, and so on are mostly bought on installment plans. When buying, a contract is signed. If you can't pay the due amount at the beginning of the month, you have to return the original item. Therefore, once an economic panic arrives, a person loses their job, which is almost equivalent to bankruptcy, and life immediately becomes a problem. Although some state governments have unemployment relief funds, the amount is so small that it cannot maintain a family's basic expenses. I remember seeing a cartoon depicting an elderly American couple celebrating their fortieth wedding anniversary. The husband said to his wife, "Dear, I have excellent news for you. The wedding ring I bought for you has been fully paid off today." This story can be said to be a profound portrayal of the American people's economic life.

        The Prevalence of "Insurance"

Precisely because of the instability of the American people's economic life, "insurance" is one of the most important issues in their lives. Not only must houses be insured, cars be insured, health be insured, and airplane rides be insured, but even singers' voices and female stars' legs must be insured. Regardless of the social stratum, the most common topic of conversation is what kind of insurance they have, with which company, and what the conditions are. This illustrates that due to economic anxiety, the American people have to use "insurance" to increase their personal "sense of security." However, what is the reality? The bosses of insurance companies will not lose money. The insurance premiums paid by people for "security" all go into the capitalists' pockets. This is a kind of invisible but extremely widespread exploitation that the American people endure. Although the American government also provides social insurance, and employees can receive a small subsidy when they retire in old age, the amount is very small, and it cannot solve practical life problems.

Due to economic instability and the lack of security in life, the American people are very sensitive to their jobs. Losing a job is tantamount to being sentenced to death. However, the right to grant jobs is mainly controlled by capitalists. Therefore, although they don't require particularly reactionary thinking from a job seeker, at least they are not allowed to have any progressive ideas. When I was working at Stanford University, I knew a physicist who belonged to the Progressive Party. After obtaining his doctorate, he had to spend much more effort than others to find a less satisfactory job. In 1952, a female teacher from the Bolivar town middle school, who attended the Asian and Pacific Region Peace Conference in Beijing, held an evening gathering at the town's public library to introduce the peaceful construction of New China after her return. Although I could see from the enthusiastic participation of the townspeople that they were very interested in learning more about New China, I later heard that this lady was dismissed from the school under some kind of pretext.

      Capitalists Manipulate Politics

This is American political freedom: Although a person enjoys many freedoms in the articles of the constitution, unfortunately, people have to eat to live, and to eat, they inevitably have to be controlled by capitalists. What's more, capitalists hire politicians and use the greatest power to influence the formulation of laws?

Speaking of capitalists manipulating politics, it is most obviously manifested in elections, of course. It is no secret that capitalists spend money to help someone run for Congress or president. During presidential election years, American society is simply much more lively. On the one hand, the behind-the-scenes bosses of each candidate use advertising cars, bands, radio, television, and other means to do a lot of publicity, and they also entertain the representatives with food, drink, and entertainment in large hotels. On the other hand, the ugly state of mutual attacks between the Democratic and Republican parties intersperses some tragicomic scenes in people's lives. In 1952, the current American Vice President Nixon was revealed to have used campaign funds for personal purposes when he was running for election. This was of course very embarrassing for the Republican presidential candidate Eisenhower, who therefore indicated that he might not accept him as a running mate. As a result, this vice-presidential candidate cried on television and explained his "grievances" to the people of the country, superficially burying the scandal. The people are generally "concerned" about the election, but this "concern" is not because they believe that the elected leader will influence their future, but only because the curiosity aroused by newspapers, magazines, radio, television, and so on has to be satisfied. During the vote counting of the general election, some people stay up all night listening to the radio. But if you ask them which party's election would be more beneficial to the people, they also know that there is no difference. Their interest is in listening to the constantly changing election results, as if they had bought lottery tickets or were watching a soccer game, just feeling excited and fun. The American people are disgusted with politicians and also know that it's just a change of soup but not of ingredients, and it makes little difference who is elected.

There is no question that capitalists spend money to help someone run for election with conditions. The elected person gives some consideration to the enterprises of the capitalists who supported him, whether in legislation, administration, or inside information, and the capitalists can recover their investment with many times the profit. Moreover, the candidates for heads of many government departments are often designated by the behind-the-scenes capitalists when someone runs for president. This is really no different from "buying and selling official titles" in ancient China. Some local thugs are often able to manipulate a large number of votes during elections, and therefore become the object of contact for local officials running for election. The conditions are very simple, just promise to protect them a little after being elected. This can be said to be the basic reason for the proliferation of hooligans and gangsters in American society. Many police chiefs rely on the votes of local evil forces when running for election, so how can one hope that he will rectify the local area? At the same time, such local officials rarely end up not colluding with the thugs. Therefore, incidents of corruption and bribery in American politics are endless, and it is impossible to finish talking about them for a while.

      A Huge Propaganda Machine

In addition to directly spending money to support the elections of both parties, another major way for American capitalists to influence politics is through the propaganda role of the news organizations they control. Although there are thousands of newspapers across the United States, the number of progressive ones or those that handle news more fairly is very small. And the source of news for general newspapers is mainly purchased from two news agencies. What is often printed in large letters on the front page of newspapers is yellow social news such as murder cases. There are two or thirty magazines and periodicals with sales of over one million, such as "Reader's Digest" and "Life," most of which are controlled by different capitalists. Most of the radio and television broadcasting stations belong to the four major broadcasting companies. The interests of the behind-the-scenes bosses, of course, determine the style of these huge and effective propaganda tools. Speaking of the control and lack of freedom of American news, I cannot help but think of the incident in 1951 when I and eight other people on the same ship were unreasonably detained by the American government when we passed through Honolulu on our way back to China because we studied science and engineering. Although the news agencies had issued reports about this matter at the time, most of the newspapers did not publish them. After returning to China, when I talked to some American people about this matter, they were all extremely surprised and thought it was impossible because in their minds, the "free and democratic" America would not be so rude and unreasonable. This also shows how much the general public is kept in the dark and is fooled by "free" news.

The newspapers, magazines, movies, and other propaganda institutions in the hands of capitalists not only deceive the people's eyes and ears, but their greater crime lies in encouraging pornographic, money-worshipping, and violent ideas, which greatly affect the safety of American society. In terms of the crime records of bank robbery and rape, the United States is probably the most advanced. An even more serious social problem than adult crime is the problem of "juvenile delinquency." On the one hand, American children are tempted by all kinds of bad things done by adults, and on the other hand, they lack normal activities and organizations. Therefore, they are uneasy and have nowhere to use their energy. Robbing taverns, stealing cars, and indulging in sexual relations are their daily routines. In the summer of 1955, when I was working in Chicago, there were two incidents within two or three months in which middle school students sneaked into the school in the middle of the night and burned and destroyed files, classrooms, etc. The school had to suspend classes because of this. Some cities implement a "curfew" for children at night, that is, children are not allowed to go out on the streets, as a measure to prevent "juvenile delinquency." But nighttime is also when adults are absurd, and preventing children from going out on the streets will not really solve the problem. (Attached picture)

    我们见到的美国
    谢家麟
    （上）
    一个人对自己祖国以外的国家的认识，一般说来是很难全面的。因为他的见闻，常常为他在那个国家内生活的圈子所限。因此，下面谈的一些个人的印象，局限的毛病，是在所难免的。
    说到印象，不但有地方性，而且也有着时间性。换句说话，从表面第一次观察事物与经过长期体会所得的印象，往往是迥然不同的。
    我在1947年初到美国时，国内正是国民党政权崩溃前夕，经济极端紊乱，民不聊生的时候，他们则由于过去战时加班加点的关系，一般人民手里还比较宽裕，市场上呈现着表面的繁荣。看到充满街道的汽车，五颜六色的住宅，百货公司拥挤的顾客，当时不由得感到他们经济上的稳定和丰裕。
      缺乏生活的安全感
    但这个最初的印象没有多久就动摇了。由生活中体会到的一些事实，使我明白了美国经济上不稳定的本质。不管表面经济情况是高涨或低落，经济恐慌的忧虑就没有一天从人民心里解除过。学校里经济学教授根据美国经济周期性变化的图表，预测着就将到来的经济恐慌。报纸杂志上也经常讨论着这个使人不安的消息。美国国民经济能否从战时不正常的扩大平安地回复到常时的状态，是当时一般人忧心忡忡最担心的事。五十岁上下的人，经过了1929年经济危机，自然更是“触目惊心”，觉得生活没有保障。由于“马歇尔计划”，朝鲜战争，以及直到目前仍在继续进行的冷战，一次严重的经济危机被人为地向后拖延，但是人们都清楚地知道，往后拖并没有解决问题。而且往后拖得愈久，将来的波动愈大。在这样的情势之下，人民的心理是经常地受着威胁。因为美国盛行赊购制度，一般人的物质享受很大部分是预支的，他们的住宅，汽车等等大都是在分期付款的情形下买到的。买时订了合同，假若你在月头上付不出应付的款，就得把原物交回。故此一旦经济恐慌到来了，一个人失了业，也就差不多等于破了产，生活马上成了问题。虽然有的州政府设有失业救济金，但是数目小得可怜，是不能维持一个家庭的起码开支的。我记得看过一幅漫画，形容一对美国年老夫妻在庆祝他们结婚四十周年，丈夫对妻子说：“亲爱的，告诉你一个极好的消息，我为你买的结婚戒指，今天已经完全付清了”；这个故事，可以说是美国人民经济生活深刻的写照。
        “保险”盛行
    也就是因为美国人民经济生活的不稳定，“保险”在他们生活里是最主要的问题之一。不但房子要保险，汽车要保险，健康要保险，坐飞机要保险，就是歌唱家的嗓子，女明星的大腿也要保险。无论那个阶层的人物，最普通的谈话材料就是保些什么险，在哪个公司，条件怎样之类的话。这说明了美国人民由于经济的焦虑，只好借“保险”来增加个人的“安全感”。然而，实际上怎样呢？保险公司老板们是不会赔本的，人们为了“安全感”。而付出的保险费，都进入了资本家的荷包。这是美国人民忍受的一种无形的，但极普遍的剥削。虽然美国政府也办着社会保险，工作人员在年老退休时，可以领到一点补助，然而数目很小，它是不能解决实际生活问题的。
    由于经济的不稳定和生活的没有保障，美国人民对职业是十分敏感的。失掉职业，无异被判死刑。然而给予职业的权利主要是操纵在资本家手里，因此对一个找职业的人，虽然不要求思想上特别的反动，但起码是不允许有一点前进的。我在斯丹福大学工作的时候，认识一个属于进步党的物理学工作者，他在得到博士学位之后，就比别人多费了许多力气才找到一个不太满意的工作。1952年到北京参加亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的一位柏罗阿陀镇中学的女教师，会后归去曾在该镇公共图书馆举行介绍新中国和平建设情况的晚会。虽然从参加人数的踊跃，我可以看出一般镇民都很喜欢对新中国多所了解，然而，后来听说这位太太却在某种借口之下，被学校辞退了。
      资本家操纵着政治
    美国的政治自由就是这样：在宪法的条文上尽管一个人享受很多的自由，但无奈人活着就得吃饭，而要吃饭就难免受资本家的控制，更何况资本家雇用了政客，在用最大的力量来影响法律的制定呢？
    谈到资本家的操纵政治，当然最明显是表现在选举上了。资本家出钱帮助某某人做竞选议员或总统的经费，并不是什么秘密的事。到了总统选举年，美国社会平白热闹了许多。一方面由于各竞选人的后台老板，使用了广告汽车，乐队，无线电，电视等大做宣传，并且在大旅馆里招待代表们吃喝玩乐，另一方面也由于民主，共和两党的彼此攻击的丑态，给人民生活中穿插了一些悲喜剧的场面。1952年现任美国副总统尼克松竞选时，就被揭发曾把竞选经费做了私人用场，这当然使共和党总统候选人艾森豪威尔十分难堪，因此表示可能不接受他共同竞选。结果这位副总统候选人在电视中哭哭啼啼，向全国人民解释他的“冤屈”，把一桩丑事马虎掩埋了事。人民对选举一般是“关心”的，但是这种“关心”，并不是由于相信选出的领袖会左右他们的将来，而只是由报纸，杂志，无线电，电视等所激起的好奇心要得到满足而已。他们在大选计票时，有些人觉也不睡地守在无线电旁听着。但你若问他哪一个党当选会对人民有更大的好处呢？他也知道是没有什么区别的。他们的兴趣是听着随时变化的计票的结果，有如买了马票或看足球比赛，只是觉得刺激好玩而已。美国人民是厌恶政客的，也知道换汤不换药，谁当选也差不多。
    资本家出钱替某人竞选，没有问题是有条件的，当选人对支持他的资本家的企业无论在立法上，行政上，或是内幕消息上稍加照顾，资本家就可以把他的投资加多少倍利润收回了。而且，政府许多部门的首长人选，往往在某人竞选总统时就为后台资本家所指定了。这与中国古代“买官鬻爵”，实在没有什么不同。一些地方上的恶棍，在选举时往往能操纵大量的票数，因此便成为地方官竞选连络的对象。条件很简单，只要答应当选后包庇他们一下就行了。这点可说是美国社会上流氓地痞泛滥的基本原因。警察局长竞选时很多就依靠着地方恶势力的票子，又哪里能希望他整肃地方呢？同时，这样的地方官，也很少最后不与恶棍们同流合污的，因此，美国政治上贪污腐败的事件，层出不穷，一时是说不完的。
      庞大的宣传机器
    美国资本家影响政治，除了直接出钱支持两党竞选外，另一主要方式是通过他们掌握的新闻机构的宣传作用。美国全国报纸，虽然大小不下几千家，但进步的，或是处理新闻比较公允的却是屈指可数的。而一般报纸消息的来源，又都主要是从两个通讯社购买的。报纸首页大字登载的，经常是些谋杀案等黄色的社会新闻。杂志刊物销路百万以上的有二、三十种，如“读者文摘”，“生活”等等大多数都操纵在不同的资本家手里。大部的无线电和电视广播台，是隶属于四大广播公司的。后台老板们的利益，当然也就决定了这些庞大有效的宣传工具的作风了。谈起美国新闻之被控制与没有自由，我不由想到1951年回国途经檀香山时，我与另外八位同船的因为念理工而被美国政府无理地扣留那件事。虽然当时通讯社曾发过有关这事的报道，但是报纸上绝大多数都没有登载。回去后与一些美国人民谈起这事，他们都是万分诧异，认为这是不可能的，因为他们心目中“自由民主”的美国，是不会这么蛮横无理的。这也就说明了一般人民是多么地被蒙在鼓里，受着“自由”新闻的愚弄。
    掌握在资本家手里的报纸杂志，电影等宣传机构，不仅仅蒙蔽了人民的耳目，而它更大的罪恶，是在于鼓励色情、拜金、暴力的思想，大大影响了美国社会的安全。以抢银行与强奸案的犯罪记录来说，美国恐怕是最先进的了。较成人犯罪更为严重的社会问题是“儿童犯罪”的问题。美国儿童一方面受到成人所做的各种坏事的诱惑，一方面又缺少正常的活动与组织。因此彷徨不安，精力无所施展。抢酒馆，偷汽车和在性关系上的放纵，都是他们的家常便饭。1955年夏天，我在芝加哥工作，两三个月内便发生了两次中学生们在半夜潜入学校把文件、教室等焚烧、捣毁的事件，学校为此只好停课。有些城市在晚上对儿童实行“戒严”，即不许儿童上街，以为防止“儿童犯罪”的措施。可是晚上也是大人们荒唐的时候，不让儿童上街，又那里会真正解决问题呢？（附图片）
