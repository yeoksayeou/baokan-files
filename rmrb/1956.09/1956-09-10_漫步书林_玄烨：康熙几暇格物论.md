    Rambling Through the Book Forest
    Xuan Ye: Kangxi's "Leisurely Investigations of Things"

    In ancient China, there were indeed "many people" who possessed a fresh sense of things and conducted meticulous investigations, thereby discovering or inventing scientific principles or laws, or developing new varieties of flora and fauna beneficial to mankind. Let's take a relatively novel example.
    In the Fengze Garden, there were several plots of paddy fields planted with Yudao (jade rice) seeds. Every year in September, the harvest began. One day, the emperor was walking along the field paths. It was late June, and the rice ears were just emerging. Suddenly, he saw a stalk that stood taller than the rest, already bearing ripe grains. He ordered the seeds to be collected and tested the following year to see if they matured earlier. The following June, this variety indeed ripened first. From then on, it reproduced continuously, yielding hundreds upon hundreds of harvests each year. For over forty years, the imperial kitchen had been serving this rice. Its color was slightly reddish, the grains were long, the aroma was fragrant, and the taste was rich. Because it originated from the imperial garden, it was named "Imperial Rice." It could be harvested twice a year, yielding two crops. When rice was planted outside the Great Wall, it could not mature a few days after the White Dew solar term (around September 7th). Only this variety could be harvested before the White Dew. Therefore, the rice harvested from the mountain villa's paddy fields each year was used for summer retreats, with some surplus remaining. The seeds were once distributed to the governors and textile commissioners of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, instructing the people to plant them. It is said that this rice was quite abundant in the two provinces, but it was a pity that it was not widely cultivated. The climate in the South is warmer, so it must mature earlier than in the North. Between summer and autumn, there is a gap between the wheat and rice harvests. This early rice would greatly benefit the people. If two crops could be grown in a year, the yield per acre would be doubled, and future granaries could be gradually filled. This passage is found in "Kangxi's Leisurely Investigations of Things" ("Imperial Writings, Fourth Collection," Volumes 26 to 31) and is also quoted in the Qianlong edition of "Yuan Shi Tong Kao" (Comprehensive Examination of Sources for the Times). In the late Qing Dynasty, the imperial clansman Sheng Yu extracted these six volumes, transcribed them into two books, and had them printed. Just by walking along the paths of the Fengze Garden and paying a little attention, he discovered the "Imperial Rice," a "fine grain" that would "greatly benefit the people"! I wonder if this "Imperial Rice" is still being grown near Beijing today? Hopefully, it has not become extinct. It should be vigorously promoted. In the same book (Volume 26), there is also a section on "White Millet":
    Millet (according to the "Materia Medica," millet is also known as glutinous millet) comes in yellow and white varieties. The yellow variety can be sticky or non-sticky. The "Materia Medica" notes: "Sticky millet is called sorghum, which northerners call yellow rice." Only white millet is always non-sticky. Seven years ago, a stalk of white millet suddenly grew in a tree hole in the Ula area. The local people planted it and harvested it. It reproduced continuously, eventually filling acres of land. It tasted sweet and delicious, and its texture was soft and smooth. Some people brought this millet to offer to the emperor. The emperor ordered it to be planted within the mountain villa. The stems, leaves, and ears were twice as large as other varieties, and it matured earlier. When made into cakes, it was as white as glutinous rice, and its texture was even more delicate, fragrant, and smooth. This was also an accidental "discovery." And this variety of "White Millet" has since spread to various regions. Xuan Ye was a wise and enlightened figure. He paid attention to "new things" everywhere and studied them diligently. The Palace Museum still houses many of the instruments he used. Some of these instruments came from England, but others were manufactured in China. The era of Kangxi (1662-1722) is worthy of study by our historians and historians of science. Furthermore, our country's various regions have an extremely rich variety of rice, wheat, and other "grains." I believe that there may still be opportunities to discover excellent seeds like the "Imperial Rice" and "White Millet." As long as everyone pays close attention and observes carefully, there is a possibility of encountering such an opportunity. In the rural "cooperatives," there are experienced "old farmers" and young people who have studied agricultural science. They are constantly working in the fields, so they should pay attention and observe more carefully. Perhaps some excellent new varieties will be discovered by them. This is beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, and the relationship is not shallow.

    玄烨：康熙几暇格物论

    对于事物有新鲜的感觉有缜密的考察，因而发现或发明些科学原理或规律，或有益于人类的动、植物的新品种的，在中国古代实“大有其人”。且举一个比较新鲜的例子吧。
    丰泽园中，有水田数区，布玉田谷种。岁至九月，始刈获登场。一日，循行阡陌。时方六月下旬，谷穗方颖。忽见一科，高出众稻之上，实已坚好。因收藏其种，待来年验其成熟之早否。明年六月时，此种果先熟。从此生生不已，岁取千百。四十余年以来，内膳所进，皆此米也。其米色微红而粒长，气香而味腴。以其生自苑田，故名御稻米。一岁两种，亦能成两熟，口外种稻，至白露以后数天，不能成熟。惟此种可以白露前收割。故山庄稻田所收，每岁避暑用之，尚有赢余。曾颁给其种与江、浙督抚、织造，令民间种之。闻两省颇有此米，惜未广也。南方气暖，其熟必早于北地。当夏、秋之交，麦禾不接。得此早稻，利民非小。若更一岁两种，则亩有倍石之收，将来盖藏，渐可充实矣。这一段话见于“康熙几暇格物论”，（“御制文第四集”卷二十六至卷三十一）亦见引于乾隆本“援时通考”。清末，宗室盛昱亦曾将此编六卷抽出，录为两本，石印行世。只为了在丰泽园的阡陌上走走，留一下子神，便发现了“御稻米”这个“嘉谷”，“利民非小”！今此种“御稻米”，不知北京附近尚有种之者否？想不至绝种。应该大大地提倡一下方是。在同书里（卷二十六），又有“白粟米”一则云：
    粟米（本草，粟米即小米）有黄白二种。黄者有粘有不粘。本草注云：粟粘者为秫，北人谓为黄米是也。惟白粟则性皆不粘。七年前，乌喇地方树孔中，忽生白粟一科。土人以其播获。生生不已，遂盈亩顷。味既甘美，性复柔和。有以此粟来献者。朕命布植于山庄之内。茎干叶穗，较他种倍大，熟亦先时。作为糕饵，洁白如糯稻，而细腻香滑殆过之。这也是偶然的“发见”。而“白粟”的一种，便自此传遍各地了。玄烨是一位英明的人物。他对于“新鲜事物”，处处留神，事事研究。现在故宫博物院里还藏有不少他所用的仪器。有的仪器，还是从英国来的，但也有中国自己制造的。康熙这一个时代（1662—1722年），很值得我们历史学家们和科学史家们研究一下。又，我国各地区的稻、麦诸“谷”，品种丰富极了。我相信，可能还会有像发见“御稻米”和“白粟”那样的“嘉谷”的优良种子的机会。只要大伙儿仔细留神，处处注意，就会有碰到这个机会的可能。农村的“合作社”里，有经验丰富的“老农”，也有学过农业科学的青年们，他们短不了天天在阡陌上跑，倒要留点神，多观察观察，可能会有什么优良的新品种给他们发见出来呢。那便于国计民生，关系非浅了。
