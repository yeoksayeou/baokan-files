    No Pressuring Grades and Prices

    Autumn and winter are the main seasons for agricultural production cooperatives and farmers to sell agricultural and sideline products. How should state procurement departments and supply and marketing cooperatives stipulate reasonable prices when purchasing these products? How to correctly assess the grade of products? These are very important questions.

    For several years, the state-stipulated purchase prices for major agricultural products such as grain and cotton have been basically reasonable. The vast majority of state grassroots procurement units and supply and marketing cooperatives have faithfully implemented the state's procurement policies, and have not only successfully completed the state's annually increasing procurement tasks, but also played an active role in promoting the production of agricultural and sideline products, increasing farmers' incomes, and improving people's lives.

    However, we must also see that farmers still have quite a few opinions on agricultural product procurement work. Many farmers believe that some grassroots procurement units violate state price policies and lower product grades and prices. For example, in Jiangsu Province last year, the grade of silkworm cocoons purchased was generally lowered by two grades, and farmers earned about six yuan less for selling a dan of silkworm cocoons. The wool purchased in Suzhou Prefecture was generally 15-20% lower than it should have been. Farmers are extremely dissatisfied with this phenomenon of lowering grades and prices, and this is as it should be.

    Some personnel who purchase agricultural and sideline products do so not out of their own selfishness, but in order to safeguard "national interests." They say, "Pay a low price and buy good goods" to "make a profit" for the country and "accumulate funds." What's wrong with that? These people put national interests in opposition to the interests of the people, and are only responsible to the country and not to the masses. Economically, they harm the interests of cooperatives and farmers, and politically, they also harm the relationship between cooperatives and the state, and farmers and the state. This is damaging the interests of the country, so how can it be said to be safeguarding "national interests"?

    However, some personnel who purchase agricultural and sideline products do such things that harm the interests of farmers out of an unspeakable psychology. They attempt to use this method to "show their ability" and "gain the trust of the leadership." Procurement officer He Chengming is like this. From 1953 to 1955, he handled the purchase of 132,800 jin of hemp. Not only was there no reasonable loss, but the scale increased by 10,000 jin. This year, he purchased 250,000 jin of top-grade hemp, of which 35,000 jin were downgraded. These practices are very wrong. Procurement personnel who have made this mistake should resolutely correct it. Farmers who are directly related to them should also boldly expose their "pressure grading and pricing" behavior and help and supervise them to correct their mistakes.

    For several years, the central economic departments have repeatedly instructed grassroots procurement units to correct the phenomenon of "pressure grading and pricing." Why can't this phenomenon be completely corrected? In addition to the ideological and work style problems existing in some procurement personnel themselves, it is also related to the erroneous business ideas of some procurement units. Procurement officer He Chengming said: "When the higher-level authorities convene meetings to check work, they ask about 'profits' and talk about 'profits' all the time, always circling around making money or losing money, so we pay more attention to making money." Since the higher-level leading organs do not consider how to correctly complete the procurement task, but only care about profits, how can the one-sided "national profit view" in procurement personnel be completely overcome?

    It is absolutely necessary and beneficial to the people of the whole country for the state to obtain a certain amount of profit through procurement work in order to accumulate funds for building socialism for the benefit of the entire people. However, the accumulation of the state can only be built on the basis of the continuous increase of income of farmers and cooperatives. Any behavior that ignores the interests of farmers and cooperatives and purely pursues "national profits" is wrong. The state-stipulated profit remittance task should naturally be completed. However, how to complete the state's profit remittance task is a question worth paying attention to. Is it to correctly implement the procurement policy and strive to improve business management? Or is it to "pressure grading and pricing" and covertly deduct money from farmers? The policy boundaries stipulated by the Party and the state are here.

    Of course, the phenomenon of pressure grading and pricing cannot be completely overcome, also because the varieties of native and special products that need to be purchased are very complex, while the product specifications and inspection standards stipulated by the higher-level business leading organs are not very scientific, and the business level of many procurement staff is relatively low. They lack both experience and scientific inspection standards as a basis, and they are afraid of receiving fake goods and causing losses to the country, so they adopt a "rather low than high" approach in controlling prices.

    In order to completely overcome the phenomenon of pressure grading and pricing, procurement units should publicly publicize the grade standards and grade price differences stipulated by the state, and guide the masses to classify and grade. When purchasing products, they should try to organize experienced farmers in agricultural production cooperatives to grade and evaluate themselves, and the purchasing unit will inspect. If there are different opinions, they can repeatedly negotiate. In addition, the state can also stipulate "public difference" in inspection grades, allowing a certain degree of error in inspection grades, so as to prevent procurement personnel from pressing grades and prices because they are afraid of taking responsibility. By doing so, not only can the specifications and grades of products be evaluated more reasonably, but it is also convenient to require farmers to improve product quality and sell products in accordance with the quality standards stipulated by the state. For procurement staff, we should strengthen policy, ideological, and business education to improve their ideological level and business level, then their shortcomings and mistakes will be easily corrected.

    The state gives the procurement departments a very glorious and arduous task. The state not only requires them to successfully complete the procurement plan and support the country's socialist construction; but also requires them to help farmers and agricultural production cooperatives increase their income and promote the development of agricultural and sideline production and cooperative undertakings through procurement work. Party and government leading organs at all levels, especially Party and government leading organs at the county level, have the responsibility to lead the implementation of price policies by grassroots procurement units, and the policy, ideological, and business education of procurement staff. As long as the leadership attaches importance to it, the system is scientific, and the level of cadres is improved, the phenomenon of pressure grading and pricing in procurement work can be completely overcome.

### 不准压级压价

    不准压级压价
    秋冬两季是农业生产合作社和农民出卖农副业产品的主要季节。国家采购部门和供销合作社在收购这些产品的时候，怎样规定合理的价格？怎样正确地评定产品的等级？这是十分重要的问题。
    几年以来，国家规定的粮食、棉花等主要农产品的收购价格基本上是合理的。绝大多数国家基层采购单位和供销合作社忠实地执行国家的收购政策，不仅胜利地完成了国家逐年增长的采购任务，而且在促进农副业生产，增加农民收入，改善人民生活等方面起了积极的作用。
    但是，我们必须同时看到，农民对农产品采购工作的意见还相当多。许多农民认为某些基层采购单位违背国家价格政策，压低产品等级和价格。例如，江苏省去年收购的蚕茧普遍压低了两级，农民出售一担蚕茧大约少收入六元多。苏州专区收购的绵羊毛一般偏低15—20％。农民们对于这种压低等级和价格的现象表示极大的不满，这是理所当然的。
    有些收购农副业产品的人员所以这样作，并不是出于自己的私心，而是为了维护“国家利益”。他们说：“出小价，买好货”，替国家“取得利润”，“积累资金”，有什么不好呢？这些人把国家利益和人民利益对立起来，只对国家负责，不对群众负责，在经济上损害了合作社和农民的利益，在政治上也就伤害了合作社和国家、农民和国家的关系。这是损害国家的利益，那里是维护“国家利益”呢？
    但是，也有些收购农副业产品的人员，所以要作这种损害农民利益的事情，是出于一种见不得人的心理。他们企图用这种方法“显显自己的能力”，“取得领导的信任”。采购员何承铭就是这样的。他从1953年到1955年经手收购了十三万二千八百斤麻，不但没有合理的损耗，反而长秤一万斤；今年收购头麻二十五万斤，有三万五千斤压低了等级。这些做法是很错误的，犯了这种错误的收购人员自己应该坚决改正这种错误，同他们直接发生关系的农民也要大胆揭发他们“压级压价”的行为，帮助和督促他们改正错误。
    中央各个经济部门几年来一再指示基层采购单位，纠正“压级压价”的现象，这种现象为什么一直不能彻底纠正呢？这除了某些采购人员本身存在的思想作风的毛病以外，和某些采购单位错误的经营思想也有关系。采购员何承铭说：“上级召开会议，检查工作，开口问‘利润’，闭口问‘利润’，总是在赚钱赔钱上打圈子，我们就更是注意赚钱了。”既然上级领导机关并不考虑怎样正确地完成采购任务，而只是关心利润，采购人员中片面的“国家利润观点”怎能彻底克服呢？
    国家为了全体人民的利益，为了积累建设社会主义的资金，通过采购工作取得一定的利润，完全是必需的，对全国人民都有好处。但是，国家的积累只能建立在农民和合作社不断增加收入的基础上，任何忽视农民和合作社的利益，单纯追求“国家利润”的行为都是错误的。国家规定的上缴利润任务，自然是应该完成的。但是，用什么方法完成国家的上缴利润任务，却是一个值得注意的问题。是正确执行收购政策，努力改进经营管理呢？还是“压级压价”，变相地克扣农民呢？党和国家规定的政策界线就在这里。
    当然，压级压价的现象不能彻底克服，也由于目前需要收购的土产、特产的品种非常复杂，而上级业务领导机关规定的产品规格和检验标准还不十分科学，许多采购工作人员的业务水平比较低，他们既缺乏经验，又没有科学的检验标准作为依据，害怕收了假货使国家遭受损失，以致在价格的掌握上采取了“宁低勿高”的办法。
    为了彻底克服压级压价的现象，采购单位应该公开宣传国家规定的等级标准和等级差价，指导群众分级分类；在收购产品的时候，尽量组织农业生产合作社里有经验的农民自己分级评等，由收购单位检验，双方有不同意见，可以反复协商。此外，国家还可以规定验级“公差”，允许验级中有一定的差错，以免收购人员因为怕负责任，而发生压级压价的行为。这样做，不仅产品的规格和等级可以评定的更加合理，同时也便于要求农民提高产品质量，按照国家规定的质量标准出售产品。对于采购工作人员应该加强政策、思想和业务教育，提高他们的思想水平和业务水平，那末，他们的缺点和错误是容易纠正的。
    国家给予采购部门非常光荣、艰巨的任务。国家不仅要求他们胜利地完成采购计划，支援国家的社会主义建设；而且要求他们通过采购工作，帮助农民和农业生产合作社增加收入，促进农副业生产和合作事业的发展。各级党政领导机关，特别是县一级的党政领导机关，对于基层采购单位执行价格政策的情况，对于采购工作人员的政策、思想和业务教育，负有领导的责任。只要领导重视了，制度科学了，干部的水平提高了，采购工作中的压级压价现象就能够彻底克服。
