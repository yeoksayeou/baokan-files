Xinhua News Agency, Tangshan, 5th. Over the past four months, basic construction units in Tangshan City have saved 308 tons of steel and 1,115 tons of cement.

The construction workers and engineering technicians in this city have created more than 30 methods to improve project quality and save steel and cement. Jin Xueshu, an engineer from Kailuan Coal Mine Civil Engineering Company, experimented with adding large pieces of raw gangue to cement when building the coal bin project at Majiagou Mine. The amount of cement needed per cubic meter of concrete was reduced by 15% compared to the original, and all quality reached first-class standards. The Kailuan Coal Mine has many discarded winch wire ropes. After repeated research by employees of the construction company, the wire ropes were disassembled, straightened and used to replace steel bars. Tests have shown that the tensile strength per square centimeter reached more than 15,000 kilograms, which is more than 38 times greater than the tensile strength of the same amount of steel bars. The company has saved 53 tons of good steel using this method.

In the past four months, construction workers in Tangshan City have also promoted more than 20 advanced experiences in saving steel and cement, such as cold-drawing steel bars.

    拆开绞车钢丝灌绳代替钢筋
    新华社唐山5日电　唐山市各基本建设单位在过去的四个多月中，节约了三百零八吨钢筋和一千一百十五吨水泥。
    这个市的建筑工人和工程技术人员、创造出三十多种提高工程质量又节省钢筋水泥的办法。开滦煤矿土木建筑工程公司工程师靳学书在建筑马家沟矿煤仓工程时，试验出在水泥里掺大块毛碴办法，每一立方公尺混凝土水泥的需用量比原来减少15％，质量全部达到一级品。开滦煤矿有很多作废的绞车钢丝灌绳。经过建筑公司职工的多次研究，把钢丝灌绳拆开砸直代替钢筋。经试验每一平方公分的抗拉力达到一万五千多公斤，比同量钢筋的抗拉力大三十八倍多。这个公司用这种办法已经节省了五十三吨好钢筋。
    唐山市的建筑工人，在过去的四个月中还推行了冷拉钢筋等二十多种节约钢筋、水泥的先进经验。
