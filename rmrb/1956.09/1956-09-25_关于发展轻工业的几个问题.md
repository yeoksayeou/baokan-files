    Regarding Several Questions on the Development of Light Industry
    Speech by Comrade Jia Tuofu, Director of the Fourth Office of the State Council
    I fully agree with Comrade Liu Shaoqi's political report, the new Party Constitution, Comrade Deng Xiaoping's report, the suggestions for the Second Five-Year Plan, and Comrade Zhou Enlai's report.

    Now I would like to express some opinions on several issues related to the development of light industry.

    During the First Five-Year Plan period, light industrial production has already seen significant development, and it is expected that there will be even more development during the Second Five-Year Plan. This is an inevitable trend to adapt to China's economic prosperity and the improvement of people's lives. Of course, to develop light industry, we must prioritize the development of heavy industry and vigorously develop agriculture. The latter is the premise and foundation of the former. We have already had considerable experience in this regard. However, on the other hand, while prioritizing the development of heavy industry and vigorously developing agriculture, light industry must also be actively developed accordingly. If we ignore the appropriate development of light industry, we will not be able to meet farmers' needs for light industrial products, and we will not be able to exchange them for grain and agricultural cash crops in a timely manner. This will hinder the development of agriculture, unbalance the various links of the national economy, adversely affect the improvement of people's lives and the consolidation of the worker-peasant alliance, and reduce national accumulation, which will inevitably weaken the development speed of heavy industry. Therefore, during the Second Five-Year Plan period, it is completely necessary and possible for light industrial production to increase by more than 60% on the basis of the development during the First Five-Year Plan.

    After the proportional relationships between agriculture and industry, light industry and heavy industry are correctly resolved, the main problem is to conduct comprehensive planning and unified arrangements between existing industries and new industries, coastal industries and inland industries, large industries and small industries, and central industries and local industries, so that these complex relationships in all directions can be coordinated, in order to facilitate the development of industry and the national economy.

    The Relationship between Existing Industries and New Industries

    The correct relationship between existing industries and new industries should be to first consider leveraging the production potential of existing industries when increasing production to meet social needs. During the First Five-Year Plan period, approximately 90% of light industrial production relied on existing industries; and in the national light industrial output value, the production of former private industries and handicrafts accounted for approximately 60% or more. Now, most private industries have achieved joint public-private ownership, and handicrafts have achieved cooperativization. If necessary production reorganizations, enterprise reforms, and technical transformations are carried out on this basis, then enormous production potential will certainly be unleashed. Leveraging the production potential of existing industries requires not only strengthening production management and improving technical levels, but also carrying out necessary and possible renovations and expansions, because renovating and expanding existing industries requires less investment, faster construction, and greater benefits than building new ones, and it can also save technical personnel and management cadres. Even new industries need the support of existing industries. Therefore, any idea that neglects existing industries is wrong; even for those enterprises with relatively backward technology and management, a negative attitude should not be adopted. However, this does not mean that we can neglect new industries because we value existing industries, because when the production potential of existing industries has been fully leveraged and still cannot meet social needs, then new construction must be carried out. During the First Five-Year Plan period, we have carried out some new construction in light industry, especially in the textile, paper, sugar, and pharmaceutical industries. It is expected that during the Second Five-Year Plan period, not only will these industries need more new construction, but also some new industrial sectors will need to be established or expanded. Therefore, during the Second Five-Year Plan period, the basic construction tasks of light industry will be much heavier than in the First Five-Year Plan; the proportion of investment in light industry in industrial investment should also be higher than the approximately 12% in the First Five-Year Plan.

    The Relationship between Coastal Industries and Inland Industries

    The relationship between coastal industries and inland industries is a frequently debated issue. Our original light industry was mostly concentrated in coastal areas, which reflects the irrational distribution of industry in old China. However, it should be noted that coastal industries have a long history, and to leverage the potential of existing industries, we must also pay attention to leveraging the potential of coastal industries. Taking Shanghai as an example, it currently supplies one-third of the country's needs for yarn and cloth and 60% of daily necessities. It has also played a positive leading role in new technologies and new products and has accumulated a large amount of capital for the country. It can be seen from this that leveraging the industrial potential of coastal areas not only does not contradict the development of inland industries, but also promotes the development of inland industries. Of course, some industries in coastal areas, due to their high degree of concentration and distance from raw material production areas and sales markets, do have some irrational factors. To change this situation, we cannot simply use the method of "limiting production," nor can we generally use the method of "moving factories." Instead, we should, with the development of production, after fully and rationally leveraging the production potential of industries in coastal areas, if new factories are still needed, they should generally be built in inland areas, except for a few that must be built in coastal areas, to reduce the mutual transportation of raw materials and products. When renovating and expanding factories in coastal areas, we also need to consider not creating new irrationalities. This is the correct way to leverage the positive factors of these two parts of industry, coastal and inland.

    The Relationship between Large Industries and Small Industries

    The relationship between large industries and small industries is a particularly noteworthy issue in light industry. In light industrial factories, some need to be large-scale factories and should be appropriately concentrated. However, there is currently a one-sided view that, starting only from the convenience of enterprise production and management, advocates that the larger the scale of the enterprise, the better. They do not distinguish the different characteristics of various industries, do not combine with the supply of raw materials, and especially do not consider serving consumers well. Light industry, especially local light industry, has a large regional character. The source of raw materials and the sales markets of products are generally very dispersed, and people's needs change quickly. In these circumstances, not only should existing factories and handicraft cooperatives not be merged too much or too large, but also newly built factories should generally not be too concentrated; because this excessive merger and concentration, although it has its conveniences in terms of production and management, will create irrational phenomena in terms of raw material supply and product sales, especially in terms of the supply of feed and fertilizer to rural areas by-products and wastes of certain food industries; the investment effect cannot be realized in a timely manner, and the variety and designs of products cannot meet the ever-changing needs of the people. Therefore, while building some necessary large-scale industries, we must correspondingly pay attention to the development of small and medium-sized industries; in the reorganization and transformation of joint public-private industries and handicraft cooperative organizations, we should pay attention to retaining a considerable number of factories and cooperative organizations that can flexibly adapt to market needs; do not blindly merge them all; for products that mechanical industries cannot supply adequately, we should make full use of the power of handicrafts, and conduct reasonable arrangements for mechanical industries and handicrafts under the principle of overall planning and consideration of all parties. Especially in small and medium-sized cities and county towns, handicrafts should be used as the foundation for developing local industries. Of course, if we think that factories are always better if they are smaller and more dispersed under any conditions, this is obviously not correct. For industries such as textiles, paper making, and sugar making, concentration can be appropriately arranged under possible conditions such as raw materials, markets, and transportation.

    The Relationship between Central Industries and Local Industries

    The relationship between central industries and local industries is how to correctly organize and combine these two kinds of initiatives. Currently, the output value of local light industry accounts for about 80% of the national light industry output value, and a large part of the newly built factories in light industry during the Second Five-Year Plan will still rely on local governments. It can be seen that local governments bear a great responsibility for the development of light industry. China has a vast territory and a large population, and the economic development of various regions is unbalanced, and the needs of the people vary greatly. Therefore, we must fully utilize all resources that can be utilized by local governments, leverage production potential, and develop local small and medium-sized industries to meet local needs and supplement the deficiencies of central industries. Of course, the development of local industries must be carried out actively and in a planned manner under the unified national plan and according to the specific conditions of each region, adapting to local conditions. In order to fully leverage the initiative of local governments, in principle, local industrial enterprises should no longer be taken over by the central government in the future; for some enterprises that are suitable for local management but not suitable for central management, they should also be gradually transferred to local governments in a prepared manner. For newly built light industrial enterprises in the future, as long as the local government has the conditions and the ability, it can be established by the local government under the unified planning of the central government. In areas with weak industrial foundations, especially ethnic minority areas, if the local government's ability is insufficient, the central government can assist. The central industrial departments should also actively support and assist the development of local industries in terms of technical supply, cadre training, and business management. Solving the Problems of Equipment Supply and Training of Technical Personnel

    In the basic construction of light industry, it is urgently required to solve the problems of equipment supply and the training of technical personnel. At present, the supply of some equipment in the food industry, daily necessities industry, and textile industry has not yet been determined. It is hoped that the machinery manufacturing departments will pay attention to this weak link and effectively solve it; among the local machinery industries, factories that were originally able to manufacture light industrial machinery should be adjusted and improved to make them professional or factories mainly engaged in light industrial machinery manufacturing; the light industrial departments should also organize their own machinery repair and fitting forces to cooperate with each other and undertake certain equipment manufacturing tasks. Equipment repair in existing factories is also a serious problem. The machines in some factories have malfunctions, and some equipment has the potential to cause serious danger at any time. They cannot be repaired and fitted in time, affecting production and safety. This must be solved. In terms of technical personnel training, in addition to the light industrial departments paying attention to training in production, it is recommended to establish some necessary institutions of higher learning to train light industrial talents, or to run well the departments and majors that train light industrial talents in existing institutions of higher learning, and to plan to add secondary technical schools.

    Expanding and Fully Utilizing Light Industrial Raw Material Resources

    In order to develop light industrial production, we must use more effort in the future to expand and utilize the raw material resources of light industry and improve the supply of raw materials.

    Most of the raw materials for light industry come from agriculture. Over the past four years, the planting area and output of major economic and technical crops have increased to varying degrees compared with 1952, but the annual plans have mostly not been completed, especially soybeans, oil crops, and jute and kenaf, which have not completed the plan in four years. It is hoped that the Party and government at all levels will implement the policy of diversified operations in the future, make comprehensive and reasonable arrangements for the production of grain and economic and technical crops, and improve the supply conditions of grain, fertilizer, and fuel in economic and technical crop areas, and expand new raw material bases. At the same time, we must gradually and appropriately adjust the prices of certain agricultural products to encourage farmers to increase production and improve quality, so that the growth rate of economic and technical crops can basically adapt to the needs of light industrial production development stipulated in the Second Five-Year Plan.

    Actively cultivating and promoting superior varieties is an important method to improve the yield and quality of agricultural and livestock products. In recent years, the promotion of improved varieties of fine-staple cotton has achieved great results. The length of cotton fiber has mostly increased to more than one inch nationwide, but the strength of the fiber is not enough and needs to be further improved. Some of the more prominent problems currently existing in the production of light industrial raw materials are: the unit yield of oil crops is too low, and the oil content varies greatly; tobacco seeds are degenerating and the quality is declining; sugar beet seeds cannot be self-sufficient and must be imported in large quantities every year; among the sugar cane nationwide, local varieties still account for 40%, and the sugar yield per mu of land is one to three times lower for local varieties than for improved varieties; due to the lack of domestic fine wool sheep, more than 10,000 tons of fine wool are imported every year; the milk yield of dairy cows is too low; the quality specifications of edible beef cattle and fat pigs do not meet the quality specifications of canned raw materials for export; the quality of raw hides cannot meet the requirements of leather making, etc. These are all problems that must be solved. It is hoped that the agricultural departments will formulate an overall plan for the work of experimenting with cultivation and promoting superior varieties, strengthen leadership, and the relevant industrial departments should actively assist and cooperate.

    Bamboo and reeds are important raw materials for paper making, construction, and hand-woven appliances, but in recent years, there has been more logging and less cultivation, and the supply is tight. There are also some sporadic special crops and agricultural and sideline products and local products that are often easily overlooked, such as the rush used to weave grass mats. The planting area has decreased from more than 50,000 mu to more than 20,000 mu in the past three years, while the demand for grass mats has been increasing year by year, resulting in shortages everywhere. There are many similar problems. It is hoped that comrades in various places will pay attention to taking care of the needs of all parties when arranging agricultural and sideline production.

    Many raw materials in light industry rely on heavy industry for supply, especially advanced dyes, plastics, tinplate, etc., as well as some sporadic raw materials with small quantities and small output value. It is hoped that the heavy industry departments will produce and supply them as soon as possible. As for some raw materials that are temporarily not easy to solve in terms of domestic resources and technical conditions, it is also necessary to import a certain quantity.

    The light industry departments must fully and rationally utilize the existing raw material resources. At present, in Sichuan, Shaanxi, Xinjiang and other regions, there are still many cottonseed and rapeseed directly used as fertilizer and fuel, and oil factories need to be established as soon as possible. The yield of some products in the food industry is low, and the difference between advanced and backward is huge, especially the waste in handicraft production is very large. In the future, the competent departments must strengthen their organization and leadership, improve technology, and leverage potential. In terms of recycling by-products, such as cotton seed delinting, extracting glycerin from soap waste liquid, using beet pulp as feed, and using sugar cane bagasse to make paper or brew wine, these should be accelerated. The recycling of waste materials is also an important source of raw materials. For example, tree tops, tree roots, and decayed wood in forest areas can be used to manufacture appliances and other industrial products, and rags, old shoes, and waste paper can be used to make paper, and old rubber shoes and old rubber products can be used to make reclaimed rubber. Efforts should be made to organize collection and utilization. The work of saving raw materials and experimenting with substitutes should also be continued to be strengthened, but it must be guaranteed that the quality of the products is not reduced.

    In order to ensure that the raw materials of light industry can be supplied in quality, quantity, and on time, it is recommended that in the future, agricultural raw materials should gradually implement scientific grading and classification during procurement and preliminary processing, improve storage and transportation work, and allocate and supply them according to the factory production plan; the raw materials produced by industrial departments should be tried to be transferred internally or purchased through cooperation to reduce intermediate links; factories and handicraft cooperative organizations can be allowed to directly purchase agricultural and sideline and local specialty raw materials; the raw materials supplied by commercial departments should also implement a selection system and price them according to quality and grade. Only in this way can factories obtain suitable high-quality raw materials and manufacture inexpensive and high-quality products. This is a major task for our light industrial production departments and must be completed with effort.

    When the state unifies the allocation of raw materials and the recycling of waste materials, it needs to appropriately take care of the needs of manual production and the supply of sporadic materials in the market. This year, the allocation of steel materials has been excessively compressed for manual production and the market, and the original source of relying on collecting scrap steel as raw materials for handicrafts has also been cut off, so that hundreds of thousands of hardware and iron workers generally feel the lack of raw materials, and many have even been forced to stop work and wait for materials, which not only seriously threatens the lives of workers, but also causes a shortage of supply of small agricultural tools, small hardware, and repair and fitting services. In addition to trying to take measures, attention must be paid to this when balancing the allocation of materials in the future.

    Improving Product Quality and Increasing Variety of Designs

    Accelerating the development of light industry not only requires increasing quantity, but also improving quality. Improving quality and extending the use time of products actually increases the quantity. In order to adapt to the diverse and constantly changing needs of the people, we must also continuously increase the designs and varieties. In general, the product quality of light industry has improved in recent years. Some products have approached or even reached international levels, and some export commodities have also gained credibility. However, it is undeniable that the quality of many products is not stable, and even the quality of some products has declined. The products whose quality has declined have either been restored and improved, or have not yet been restored. This is a serious problem in the current light industrial production. When raw materials are difficult and one-sided emphasis is placed on saving, when the market supply is tight and one-sided emphasis is placed on increasing production, and when inappropriate mergers and reorganizations are carried out in the transformation of private industry and handicrafts, the situation of quality decline and reduced varieties becomes more serious. The experience of this period proves that if the quality decline and variety reduction are only caused by one-sided thinking and management negligence, it is relatively easy to correct. However, if it involves problems related to production technology equipment, raw material supply, and product sales, then it cannot be completely solved at once, and these problems happen to be important problems related to the improvement of product quality. Therefore, in the future, we must resolutely correct any thinking that neglects quality, continue to strengthen technical work and improve technical level, strengthen product design and experimental research work, actively improve the supply of raw materials, and implement a high-quality and high-price price policy. If we can do this, we can provide consumers with a large number of diverse, inexpensive, and high-quality consumer goods. This is a major task for our light industrial production departments and must be completed with effort.

    关于发展轻工业的几个问题
    国务院第四办公室主任　贾拓夫同志的发言
    我完全同意刘少奇同志的政治报告、新的党章和邓小平同志的报告、第二个五年计划的建议和周恩来同志的报告。
    现在我想对发展轻工业有关的几个问题，发表一些意见。
    在第一个五年计划期间，轻工业生产已经有了较大的发展，预料在第二个五年内会有更多的发展。这是适应我国经济繁荣和人民生活改善的必然趋势。当然，要发展轻工业，就必须优先发展重工业和大力发展农业。因为后者是前者的前提和基础。这一方面，我们已经有了较多的体会。但是在另一方面，在优先发展重工业和大力发展农业的同时，轻工业也必须积极地相应地发展。如果我们忽视了轻工业的适当发展，那就不能满足农民对轻工业产品的需要，不能及时换回粮食和农业经济作物。这样，就会阻碍农业的发展，使国民经济的各个环节失去平衡，使人民生活的改善和工农联盟的巩固受到不利的影响，使国家的积累减少，最后也就必然会减弱重工业的发展速度。因此，在第二个五年计划期间，轻工业生产要在第一个五年发展的基础上再增长百分之六十以上，是完全必要的，也是可能的。
    当着农业与工业、轻工业与重工业的比例关系正确解决之后，主要的问题就是要在原有工业与新建工业之间、沿海工业与内地工业之间、大型工业与小型工业之间、中央工业与地方工业之间，进行全面的规划和统一的安排，使这四面八方错综复杂的关系取得协调，以便于工业和国民经济的发展。
    原有工业和新建工业的关系
    原有工业与新建工业的正确关系，应该是在增加生产适应社会需要的时候，首先考虑发挥原有工业的生产潜力。在第一个五年计划期间，轻工业生产大约有百分之九十是依靠原有的工业；而在全国轻工业的产值中，属于原私营工业和手工业生产的，大约占百分之六十以上。现在绝大部分私营工业已经实现了公私合营，手工业已经实现了合作化，如果在这个基础上，进行必要的生产改组、企业改革和技术改造，那就一定能够发挥出巨大的生产潜力。发挥原有工业的生产潜力，不仅要加强生产管理和提高技术水平，而且也要进行必要和可能的改建、扩建，因为对原有工业进行改建、扩建，比起新建来，毕竟是投资少、建设快、收效大，还可以节省技术人员和管理干部。就是新建工业，也需要原有工业的支援。因此，任何忽视原有工业的思想都是错误的；即使对那些技术设备和经营管理比较落后的企业，也不能采取消极态度。但这不是说，我们重视原有工业就可以忽视新建工业，因为当原有工业的生产潜力已经得到充分发挥而仍然不能满足社会需要的时候，那就必须进行新建。在第一个五年计划期间，我们在轻工业中，特别是对纺织、造纸、制糖、制药等工业，已经进行了一部分新建。预计在第二个五年计划期间，不仅这些行业需要更多的新建，而且还要建立或扩大某些新的工业部门。因此，在第二个五年计划期间，轻工业的基本建设任务将比第一个五年计划加重很多；轻工业的投资占工业投资的比重，也应该比第一个五年的百分之十二左右有所提高。
    沿海工业和内地工业的关系
    沿海工业与内地工业的关系，是经常引起争论的问题。我们原有的轻工业大部分集中在沿海地区，这是反映了旧中国工业分布的不合理。但是应该看到，沿海工业有悠久的历史，要发挥原有工业的潜力，也就必须注意发挥沿海工业的潜力。以上海为例，目前它就供应了全国纱、布需要量的三分之一和日用百货的百分之六十，在新技术、新产品方面，也起了积极的带头作用，并为国家积累了大量资金。由此可见，发挥沿海地区的工业潜力，不仅和发展内地工业不相矛盾，而且还会促进内地的工业的发展。当然，沿海工业中的某些行业，由于集中程度较大，远离原料产地和销售市场，是存在着某些不合理因素的。要改变这种情况，不能简单的用“限产”的办法，一般地也不能用“迁厂”的办法，而应该随着生产的发展，在充分地合理地发挥了沿海地区工业的生产潜力以后，如果还需要新建工厂的时候，除少数必须建在沿海地区外，一般地应该建在内地，以减少原料和产品的相向运输。在对沿海工厂进行改建扩建的时候，也需要考虑到不要造成新的不合理。这是发挥沿海和内地这两部分工业的积极因素的正确办法。
    大型工业和小型工业的关系
    大型工业与小型工业的关系，在轻工业方面是一个特别值得注意的问题。在轻工业工厂中，有一部分是需要办大型工厂并且应该适当集中的，但是，目前有一种片面观点，就是只从企业的生产和管理方便出发，主张企业的规模愈大愈好，他们没有区别各种行业的不同特点，没有结合原料的供应情况，特别是没有很好地考虑为消费者服务。轻工业特别是地方轻工业，地区性很大，原料的来源和产品的销场一般都很分散，人民的需求变化也很快，在这些情况下，不仅原有的工厂和手工业合作社不宜于过多过大地合并，就是新建的工厂，一般地也不宜于过分集中；因为这种过多过大的合并和集中，虽然在生产和管理方面有其便利条件，但是在原料供应和产品销售方面，特别是某些食品工业的副产品和废料在供应农村的饲料和肥料方面，会造成不合理的现象；投资效果也不能及时发挥，产品的品种花色也不能适应人民变化多端的需要。因此，在建设某些必要的大型工业的同时，必须相应地注意发展中小型工业；在公私合营工业和手工业合作组织的改组改造中，应该注意保留相当数量的、能灵活适应市场需要的工厂和合作组织；不要盲目地一律并掉；对机制工业供应不足的产品，应该充分利用手工业的力量，在统筹兼顾的原则下，对机制工业和手工业，进行合理的安排。特别在中小城市和县镇，应当将手工业作为发展地方工业的基础。当然，如果以为在任何条件下，工厂都是愈小愈分散愈好，这显然也是不对的。如纺织、造纸、制糖等工业，在原料、市场、运输等可能条件下，可以适当地集中。
    中央工业和地方工业的关系
    中央工业和地方工业的关系，就是如何正确地把这两种积极性组织和结合起来。现在地方轻工业产值约占全国轻工业产值的百分之八十左右，第二个五年内轻工业的新建工厂，还将有很大部分要依靠地方进行。可见地方对轻工业的发展，要负很大的责任。我国地广人多，各地区经济发展不平衡，人民需要又千差万别，所以必须充分利用地方一切可以利用的资源，发挥生产潜力，发展地方中小型工业，来满足地方的需要，以补中央工业的不足。当然，地方工业的发展，必须要在国家统一计划之下，根据各地的具体条件，因地制宜，积极地有计划地进行。为了充分发挥地方的积极性，今后原则上不应再把地方工业企业收归中央管理；对于某些适宜于地方管理而不适宜于中央管理的企业，还应该有准备地逐步划交地方。对于今后新建的轻工业企业，在中央统一规划之下，只要地方有条件，有能力，就可以由地方兴办。在工业基础薄弱地区，特别是少数民族地区，如果地方能力不足时，可由中央协助。中央工业部门还应当在技术供应、干部培养和经营管理方面，积极支持和协助地方工业的发展。解决设备供应和培养技术人员问题
    在轻工业的基本建设中，迫切要求解决设备的供应和技术人员的培养问题。目前食品工业、日用品工业和纺织工业的某些设备供应，还没有着落。希望机械制造部门重视这一薄弱环节，切实加以解决；地方机械工业中，原来能够制造轻工业机器的工厂，应当加以调整和改进，使它们成为专业的或者以轻工业机器制造为主的工厂；轻工业部门也应当将自己的机械修配力量组织起来，互相协作，担负一定的设备制造任务。现有工厂的设备修理，也是一个严重问题，有些工厂机器发生故障，有的设备随时有发生严重危险的可能，不能及时修配，影响生产和安全，必须加以解决。在技术人员的培养方面，除轻工业部门在生产中注意培养外，建议创办一些必要的培养轻工业人材的高等院校，或者在现有的高等院校中，办好培养轻工业人材的科、系，并有计划地增设中等技术学校。
    扩大和充分利用轻工业原料资源
    为了发展轻工业生产，今后我们必须使用更多的力量来扩大和利用轻工业的原料资源，改进原材料的供应工作。
    轻工业的原材料，绝大部分来自农业，四年来主要经济技术作物的种植面积和产量，都较一九五二年有不同程度的增长，但是年度计划多数未能完成，尤其是大豆、油料作物和黄麻、洋麻等，四年中都没有完成计划。希望今后各地党政贯彻多种经营的方针，对粮食和经济技术作物的生产作全面的合理安排，并改善经济技术作物区的粮食、肥料和燃料供应条件，扩大新的原料基地。同时要逐步地适当地调整某些农产品价格，以鼓励农民增加产量和提高质量的积极性，使经济技术作物的增产速度，基本上能适应第二个五年计划规定的轻工业生产发展的需要。
    积极培育和推广优良品种，是提高农业和畜牧业产品产量和质量的重要方法。几年来，细绒棉改良种的推广，已取得了很大的成绩，全国棉花纤维的长度大部分提高到一吋以上，但纤维的强度不够，尚待继续改进。目前在轻工业原料生产中存在的一些较突出的问题是：油料作物的单位产量过低，含油率高低悬殊；烟叶的种子退化，质量下降；甜菜种子不能自给，每年须大量进口；全国甘蔗中，土种还占百分之四十，而每亩地的产糖量，土种要比良种相差一倍至三倍；由于国产细毛种羊太少，每年进口细羊毛达一万吨以上；乳牛的出乳率太低；食用的菜牛、肥猪不合外销罐头原料的质量规格；原皮的质量不能符合制革的要求等。这些都是必需解决的问题。希望农业部门对试验培植和推广优良品种的工作，订出全面规划，加强领导，有关的工业部门应当积极协助、配合。
    竹子、芦苇是造纸、建筑及手工编制器具的重要原材料，但近年来采伐多，培植少，供应紧张。还有若干零星的特种作物和农业副业产品和土产品，往往容易被忽视，如编织草席的席草，三年来的种植面积，从五万多亩减至二万多亩，而草席需要量则逐年增加，以致到处脱销。类似这种问题很多，希望各地同志在安排农业和副业生产时注意照顾各方面的需要。
    轻工业中有不少的原材料须依靠重工业供应，特别是高级染料、塑料、马口铁等，以及一些数量少产值小的零星原材料，希望重工业部门早日生产供应。至于有些在国内资源及技术条件上暂时还不易解决的原材料，则进口一定的数量，也是必要的。
    轻工业部门必须充分、合理地利用现有的原料资源。目前在四川、陕西、新疆等地区，还有不少棉子、菜子直接用作肥料和燃料，需要及早建立油厂。食品工业中某些产品的出品率低，先进与落后相差悬殊，特别是手工业生产的浪费很大。今后主管部门必须加强对它们的组织领导，改进技术，发挥潜力。在回收副产品方面，如棉子脱绒，肥皂废液中提取甘油，甜菜渣作饲料，甘蔗渣造纸或酿酒等，都应该加速进行，废物废料的回收也是原材料的重要来源。如林区的树梢、树根、腐木，可以制造器具及其他工业品，破布、破鞋、废纸可以造纸，旧胶鞋、旧胶制品可以做再生胶，都应该努力组织收集利用。关于节约原材料和试验采取代用品的工作，也应该继续加强，但必须保证不降低产品的质量。
    为了保证轻工业的原材料能够按质按量按时地供应，建议今后农产原料在采购和初步加工时，应该逐步实行科学的分等分级，改善贮藏和运输工作，并按照工厂生产计划分配调拨供应；工业部门生产的原材料，应尽量采取内部调拨或协作定购等办法，减少中间环节；农副业和土特产原材料，可以允许工厂和手工业合作组织直接采购；商业部门供应的原材料，也应该实行选购制度及按质分等论价。只有这样，工厂才能取得适用的优良的原材料，制造出物美价廉的产品来。
    国家统一分配原材料和回收废料的时候，需要适当照顾手工生产和市场零星物资供应的需要，今年分配钢铁材料，对手工生产和市场压缩过多，手工业原有依靠搜集废钢铁为原料的来源也被割断，以致数十万五金铁业工人普遍感到原料缺乏，甚至有很多被迫停工待料，不但严重威胁工人生活，而且造成小农具、小五金和修配服务业的供应紧张。除应设法采取措施外，今后平衡分配物资时，必须加以注意。
    提高产品质量，增加花色品种
    加速发展轻工业，不只是要求增加数量，而且还要提高质量。提高质量、延长产品的使用时间，实际上也就是增加了数量。为了适应多种多样的、经常变化的人民需要，还要不断地增加花色和品种。轻工业的产品质量，总的来说，几年来是有改进的，某些产品已接近甚至达到国际水平，一部分出口商品也获得了信誉，但是，不可否认，还有许多产品的质量不能稳定，甚至有些产品质量下降了。质量下降的产品有的已经恢复和提高，有的还没有恢复，这是当前轻工业生产中的一个严重问题。在原料困难和片面地强调节约的时候，在市场供应紧张和片面地强调增产的时候，在对私营工业和手工业改造中进行不适当地合并和改组的时候，质量下降和品种减少的情况，就表现得更为严重。这个时期的经验证明，如果只是因为片面的思想和管理的疏忽所造成的质量下降和品种减少，是比较容易纠正的，但如果是牵连到生产技术设备、原材料供应和产品销售等方面的问题，那就不是一下能够完全解决的，而这些问题恰好都是有关产品质量改进的重要问题，因此，今后必须坚决纠正任何忽视质量的思想，继续加强技术工作和提高技术水平，加强产品设计和试验研究工作，积极改善原材料的供应，贯彻优质优价的价格政策。如果能够做到这些，我们就能为消费者提供大量的、多种多样的、物美价廉的消费品。这是我们轻工业生产部门的重大任务，必须努力完成。
