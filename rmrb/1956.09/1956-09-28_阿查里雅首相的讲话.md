Prime Minister Zhou Enlai, Ladies and Gentlemen:

    On my own behalf and on behalf of my friends, I deeply thank Your Excellency for this wonderful banquet. The warm welcome and affection so deeply expressed by your government and people have deeply moved me. This powerfully demonstrates that the bonds of friendship between us are very harmonious and close.

    The friendship between Nepal and China truly dates back more than sixteen hundred years, although this friendship has occasionally encountered setbacks in the past. As Your Excellency just aptly pointed out, since the normalization of our friendly relations last year, we have satisfactorily and successfully further developed our friendship. I believe that the recent historic agreement reached between our two countries will further promote this friendship between us.

    Nepal is very pleased to be situated between two of Asia's great and most progressive republics, namely China and India. It is indeed a pleasant thing for Nepal to have the best friendship and goodwill of its two great neighbors. Although Your Excellency mentioned the People's Republic of China's policy of non-aggression towards its neighbors, I would still like to say that the Nepalese government has never harbored such fears about its good neighbors, and since Nepal's two great neighbors are great promoters of peace, friendship, and peaceful coexistence in the modern era, Nepal has even less to fear.

    Nepal believes in the teachings of Sakyamuni, who advocated peace and righteous conduct. Therefore, naturally, our policy is one of peace and friendship, and as we see it, aggression is an unjust act, and peaceful coexistence is an ideal that everyone should follow in their dealings with other countries. Nepal is a signatory to the Bandung Declaration, a declaration that, for the first time in history, united the long-isolated Asian and African countries, and our government will continue to work for the unity of Asian and African countries. The Nepalese government will always uphold the cause of the oppressed and downtrodden people of the world in its own way.

    China and India are engaged in the great and noble work of building their countries, and Nepal is likewise striving for its economic development with its limited resources. I am confident that our three friendly countries will certainly help each other in their respective national construction.

    We are engaged in national development, and we need peace. We hope that peace will forever shine upon this world.

    Before I conclude my speech, please allow me to propose:

    To the eternal friendship between Nepal and China,
    To world peace,
    To the increasing prosperity of the People's Republic of China,
    To the health and longevity of Chairman Mao Zedong!

### 阿查里雅首相的讲话

    阿查里雅首相的讲话周恩来总理阁下，女士们和先生们：
    我以我自己的名义并代表我的朋友深深感谢阁下为我举行的这次很好的宴会。贵国政府和人民所十分深切地表示的热烈欢迎和情谊深深地感动了我。这有力地证明：我们之间的友谊联系是非常的融洽和密切。
    尼泊尔和中国的友谊真的可以追溯到一千六百多年以前，虽然这种友谊过去曾经偶尔遭到过挫折。正如阁下刚才恰当地指出：自从去年我们之间的友好关系正常化之后，我们就令人满意地和成功地进一步发展着我们的友谊。我相信，我们两国间最近所达成的历史性的协定将更加促进我们之间的这种友谊。
    尼泊尔能够处在亚洲两个伟大的最进步的共和国之间感到非常高兴，这两个国家就是中国和印度。尼泊尔能够有着它的两个伟大邻邦的最好的友谊和善意，实在是一件令人愉快的事情。虽然阁下提到了中华人民共和国对它的邻国的不侵犯政策，我还是愿意说一下，尼泊尔政府从来没有对它的好邻居抱有这种疑惧，而由于尼泊尔的这两个伟大的邻居是当代和平、友谊和和平共处的伟大促进者，尼泊尔就更没有什么疑惧了。
    尼泊尔信仰释迦牟尼的教义，他主张和平和行为端正。因此，很自然的，我们的政策是一种和平和友谊的政策，而且照我们看来，侵略是不正当的行为，和平共处才是大家在和别的国家的交往中都应该遵从理想。尼泊尔是万隆宣言的签字国，这是一个在历史上第一次把长期隔绝的亚非各国团结起来的宣言，我国政府将继续为亚非各国的团结而努力。尼泊尔政府将以它自己的方式永远维护世界上被压迫和被蹂躏的人民的事业。
    中国和印度正在进行建设他们国家的伟大而崇高的工作，尼泊尔同样地也正在以它的有限的资源为它的经济发展而努力。我确信我们三个友好国家对彼此的国家建设是一定会互相帮助的。
    我们正在从事于国家发展，我们需要和平。我们希望和平将永远普照这个世界。
    在我结束我的讲话之前，请允许我提议：
    为尼泊尔和中国的永恒友谊，
    为世界和平，
    为中华人民共和国的日益繁荣，
    为毛泽东主席的健康和长寿而干杯！
