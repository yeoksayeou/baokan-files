    Comrade Mao Zedong's opening speech, and the reports made by Comrades Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, and Deng Xiaoping on behalf of the Central Committee, profoundly summarized the Party's rich experiences since the Seventh National Congress, and correctly put forward the great tasks of continuing to complete the socialist transformation and accelerating socialist construction. All Party members and people in the Shaanxi region will certainly unite more closely around the Party Central Committee and strive to realize the resolutions of this congress.

    Since the national liberation, thanks to the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and the joint efforts of all the people, cadres, Party members, and democratic parties, the socio-economic landscape of the Shaanxi region has undergone tremendous changes. The socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce throughout the province has achieved a decisive victory. The total industrial output value in 1955 increased by 216% compared to 1949; the total agricultural output value increased by 63%. The lives of the people have improved significantly, and the social purchasing power in 1955 increased by 150% compared to 1950. These achievements prove that the line of the Party Central Committee is completely correct.

    The Eighth National Congress of the Party calls on the entire Party and the people of the whole country to strive to build our country into a great socialist industrialized country as quickly as possible. The Shaanxi region is one of the key areas for national industrial construction. In order to strongly support national industrial construction and improve people's lives, it is necessary to actively develop agriculture. The realization of agricultural cooperativization has opened up broad avenues for the development of agricultural production, and at the same time, has brought many new problems. However, due to our insufficient understanding of these new problems, an ideological style of work that is divorced from reality and divorced from the masses has grown. The recent instructions issued by the Party Central Committee and the State Council on strengthening the production leadership and organizational construction of agricultural production cooperatives have comprehensively put forward the correct guidelines and specific methods for solving these problems. Resolutely implementing these instructions will certainly further consolidate agricultural production cooperatives and develop agricultural production. Now, I would like to offer some opinions on the following three issues.

    I. Cherish and Develop the Labor Enthusiasm of Farmers
    The realization of agricultural cooperativization has greatly encouraged the labor enthusiasm of farmers. After the establishment of agricultural production cooperatives, we followed the instructions of the Central Committee and adopted methods such as running cooperatives diligently and thriftily, running cooperatives democratically, improving labor organization and production management systems, caring for the material interests of members, and strengthening ideological education for members, to develop the labor enthusiasm of members, and implemented a series of measures to increase production. Therefore, this year's crops in the Shaanxi region are generally growing well, especially wheat in the Guanzhong area. This year, the 17 million mu of wheat fields in the Guanzhong area (of which 14 million mu are dry land), although severely affected by continuous rain disasters during the summer harvest, still achieved a total wheat output of over 4 billion jin; an average yield of 233 jin per mu, which is more than 15% higher than the bumper harvest year of 1954, and more than 30 high-yield wheat fields with yields of over 1,000 jin per mu have emerged, achieving a bumper harvest that has not been seen for many years. This powerfully proves that the agricultural cooperativization movement last winter and this spring was not only rapid but also healthy. Therefore, in the first year of realizing agricultural cooperativization, production increased, demonstrating the great superiority of the socialist cooperative economy. This also shows how important it is to develop the labor enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers for the development of agricultural production!

    However, at present, not all agricultural cooperatives have fully and correctly developed the labor enthusiasm of their members. On the contrary, many agricultural cooperatives still have phenomena that do not cherish or even dampen the labor enthusiasm of their members. For example: pursuing large cooperatives, large teams, and large groups regardless of conditions, but not being good at organizing large-scale collective labor, resulting in chaotic production order and forming a phenomenon of "dispatching work randomly and everyone rushing to do the work"; only relying on orders to do things, not consulting with the masses, and some even using methods such as "deducting work points" and "not assigning work" to promote work, resulting in some members developing a passive attitude of "doing whatever the cadres say"; only caring about production, not caring much about the lives and health of members, leaving members with a lack of pocket money and a lack of time to take care of household chores and rest and entertainment, some even calling on members to "treat the dark night as daytime and the moon as an electric light," creating an excessively tense situation, leading some people to say: "Agricultural cooperatives are indeed good, but they are too tiring to bear"!

    The occurrence of these phenomena is certainly related to our lack of experience, but it is mainly due to the growth of blind optimism and impatience in the face of victory, thinking that after agricultural cooperativization, the labor enthusiasm of farmers is very high, and everything is easy to do, as if we can do whatever we want. Of course, the realization of agricultural cooperativization has indeed created extremely favorable conditions for rural work, which is the main aspect; however, the new situation has also brought many new problems. If our ideas and practices do not conform to the actual situation, we still will not do things well. With the change of ownership, the labor enthusiasm of members has indeed been greatly improved, which requires that the labor organization and production management of agricultural cooperatives must adapt to this change; otherwise, the labor enthusiasm of members cannot be maintained and fully developed. And the high development of members' labor enthusiasm must also fully develop democracy within the agricultural cooperative; if excessive one-sided emphasis is placed on centralized unity, ignoring the development of democracy, and even restricting members too much, it will suppress the labor enthusiasm of members. Of course, the fundamental guarantee for developing the labor enthusiasm of members is to increase production and increase the income of members; however, if only production is cared about, and the daily lives of members are not cared about, it will also damage the labor enthusiasm of members. Therefore, in order to fully develop the great role of the masses of farmers in production, it is necessary to earnestly improve the leadership of agricultural cooperatives in all aspects. We have learned that: the more victories we achieve, the more we need to be modest and cautious, and the more we need to develop democracy; the higher the labor enthusiasm of the masses, the more we need to cherish and correctly develop their labor enthusiasm.

    II. Use Modern Scientific Achievements and Summarize the Production Experience of Old Farmers and Experienced Gardeners
    Practice has proven that modern agricultural science plays a particularly important role in the development of agricultural production. For example, the "Bima No. 1" wheat variety bred by Professor Zhao Hongzhang of Northwest Agricultural College has been widely promoted in the Shaanxi region after the process of key experiments and multi-point demonstrations; this improved variety has increased wheat yield by more than 20%. The "No. 54" wheat bred by Comrade Zhao Jimin of the Shaanxi Agricultural Comprehensive Experimental Station has been tested for two years, and the yield is more than 13% higher than "Bima No. 1". Destructive insect pests such as wheat sucking maggots can now be controlled from occurring and spreading using scientific methods. After agricultural cooperativization, technological reform is more important and easier to implement, and the masses are more urgently asking us for technical guidance. However, some of our cadres lack the necessary production knowledge and often cannot correctly solve specific problems in production. The masses criticize us for "the old, I understand, you don't understand; the new, I don't understand, and you don't understand either," and that we are "laymen leading experts." In order to change this situation, agricultural workers and rural workers need to quickly master production knowledge, which must correctly combine the two aspects of striving to study modern agricultural science and earnestly learning and summarizing the production experience of old farmers and experienced gardeners. At present, many cadres have paid attention to learning modern scientific knowledge, which is a good phenomenon, but they do not pay enough attention to learning and summarizing the production experience of old farmers and experienced gardeners, and even think that now is the atomic energy era, and there is no need to learn from old farmers and experienced gardeners. Under the domination of this kind of thinking, they do not attach importance to the agricultural knowledge recorded in documents and circulating among the masses, and even many useful agricultural proverbs on the lunar calendar are regarded as superstitious things and overthrown. There is no doubt that modern science must be striven to study; otherwise, it will be difficult to implement technological reforms in agriculture and further develop agricultural production. However, the production experience of the masses of farmers is the source of agricultural science; paying attention to and summarizing the production experience of the masses of farmers can enrich the content of agricultural science and enable agricultural technological reforms to adapt to the different conditions of various regions. In particular, China's agriculture has a history of more than 3,000 years, and there were relatively systematic agricultural works as early as the Western Han Dynasty more than 2,000 years ago. The agricultural heritage is extremely rich. Ignoring these valuable heritages is not only a major loss for our country, but also a major loss for the treasure house of human science. Naturally, the experience of the masses has some outdated and unscientific components, and it is wrong to accept it wholesale or deny it completely without analysis. Only by paying attention to the experience of the masses and using modern scientific achievements to summarize and improve it is the correct approach. Disregarding the experience of the masses and the agricultural heritage is obviously unfounded. Taking the situation in the Shaanxi region as an example, our ancestors built one of the oldest canals in Chinese history, the "Zheng Guo Canal," in the Guanzhong Plain during the Warring States period. During the Han and Tang dynasties, they used natural water sources such as the Jing, Wei, Chan, Ba, Feng, Luo, and Yu rivers to build an irrigation system of "eight rivers around Chang'an." Farmers in this region have accumulated rich farming experience in long-term production labor. For example, farmers have many years of experience in selecting seeds based on the principle of "strong mother, fat offspring" (the "Iron Monkey Cotton" variety, which yields 800 jin of seed cotton per mu, was selected and bred by Meng Wenxi, a farmer in Jingyang, Shaanxi); have experience in preserving soil moisture and winter irrigation with "wheat harvest, next year's moisture"; have experience in fertilization with "base fertilizer, three years of strength"; have a habit of implementing row sowing; and have experience in using methods such as crop rotation and changing insect-resistant varieties to prevent and control wheat sucking maggots. It is precisely by summarizing and promoting these experiences among the masses and giving them timely guidance from a scientific and technological perspective that we have effectively promoted technological reforms. On the contrary, all those who do not pay attention to the experience of the masses and do not listen to the opinions of the masses have suffered losses in their work. The losses in this year's summer harvest are a major lesson. In the past, during the wheat harvest season, some farmers in the Guanzhong area who did large-scale farming had the reasonable experience of arranging the harvest time by "cutting some early, cutting some ripe, and cutting some dry," and also had the habit of asking farmers from early-maturing and late-maturing wheat areas to help with the rush harvest. After agricultural cooperativization, small-area production of several mu or dozens of mu has become large-area production of hundreds of mu or thousands of mu; in addition, the "Bima No. 1" wheat variety is widely planted in the Guanzhong area, with a consistent maturity period. Therefore, it is even more important to use the above experience to better organize labor to carry out rush harvesting. However, before this year's summer harvest, we did not pay attention to these experiences and did not promptly guide agricultural cooperatives to organize labor to carry out rush harvesting, which delayed the harvest time and caused the wheat to suffer from rain disasters, resulting in losses in both yield and quality. It can be seen that the harm of not paying attention to and summarizing the experience of the masses is great.

    III. Persist in Persuasion and Education, and Enlighten the Consciousness of the Masses
    The formulation of correct production plans and measures to increase production must go through careful investigation and research; and the realization of production plans and measures to increase production must be carried out with full persuasion and education work to the masses, so that the masses consciously and willingly take action. Without the conscious and willing action of the masses, nothing can be done well. When we conduct persuasion and education to the masses, we mainly adopt the method of educating the masses by the masses themselves. In the agricultural cooperativization movement, we not only organized a large number of propagandists and cadres to conduct propaganda to the masses, but also paid special attention to organizing a large number of old cooperative cadres to make roving reports to the masses, organizing new cooperative members and non-cooperative masses to visit old cooperatives, and learning methods from old cooperative members. Since this year, we have respectively held large-scale exchange meetings on cotton, corn and other high-yield experiences, and conferences of activists in water and soil conservation, and organized advanced producers to introduce production experience to the masses. At the same time, we have adopted the methods of "multi-point demonstration" and "mutual teaching and mutual learning" according to the characteristics of the masses of farmers who "look first, then try, and then do," and cultivated typical units and typical figures for promoting improved varieties, implementing close planting, and preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests. Some places have also adopted the method of "every county has a point, every district has people; every district has a point, every township has people; every township has a point, every village has people" to organize observation and promotion. Facts have proved that this method of educating the masses with their own personal experience is the most persuasive. However, some of our comrades are not good at using the working method of persuasion and education, and even less good at using the masses' own experience to educate the masses. Especially after agricultural cooperativization, thousands of scattered individual farmers participated in agricultural cooperatives, there are fewer leads, it is easier to grasp, and it is easier to promote technical measures. As a result, some comrades want to use simple administrative orders to replace the arduous work of persuasion and education. Some subjectively formulate unrealistic production increase targets and technical quotas, and mechanically require the masses to implement them. Some even set a unified production schedule, requiring agricultural cooperatives with different situations to sow on certain days and harvest on certain days, so that the masses say that these cadres are "iron policies, rigid brains." Therefore, emphasizing starting from reality and emphasizing the working method of persuasion and education are of particular importance at present.

    Problems of the above nature not only exist in our leadership of agricultural production, but also in other work. In order to fundamentally solve these problems, we are organizing cadres to earnestly study the five documents stipulated by the Central Committee, such as "Transform Our Study"; through this study, new and old cadres can understand and review the spirit of these documents, and constantly overcome the faults of subjectivism, bureaucratism, and sectarianism. At the same time, organize cadres to study the scientific knowledge and advanced experience of production and leadership. Through these measures, strengthen the Party's leadership over urban and rural work, develop industrial and agricultural production, and do all work well.

    The Eighth National Congress of the Party has given us infinite strength. We will certainly follow the spirit of the Congress, unite the entire Party and the people of the entire province more closely, and ensure the complete realization of the resolutions of the Congress.

专栏：

    进一步巩固农业合作社和发展农业生产
    张德生同志的发言
    毛泽东同志的开幕词和刘少奇同志、周恩来同志、邓小平同志代表中央委员会所作的报告，深刻地总结了党在第七次代表大会以来的丰富经验，正确地提出了继续完成社会主义改造，加速进行社会主义建设的伟大任务。陕西地区的全体党员和人民一定更加紧密地团结在党中央的周围，为实现这次大会的决议而奋斗。
    全国解放以来，由于党中央的正确领导，全体人民、干部、党员和各民主党派的共同努力，使陕西地区的社会经济面貌发生了巨大的变化。全省农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，已经取得了决定性的胜利。工业总产值一九五五年比一九四九年增长了百分之二百一十六；农业总产值增长了百分之六十三。人民群众的生活得到了显著的改善，一九五五年的社会购买力比一九五○年增长了一倍半。这些成就，证明了党中央的路线是完全正确的。
    党的第八次代表大会号召全党和全国人民为尽可能迅速地把我国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义工业化的国家而奋斗。陕西地区是国家工业建设的重点地区之一。为了有力地支援国家工业建设和改善人民生活，就必须积极地发展农业。农业合作化的实现，为农业生产的发展开辟了广阔的道路，同时也带来了许多新的问题。但是，由于我们对这些新的问题认识不足，在工作中脱离实际、脱离群众的思想作风有了滋长。最近党中央、国务院发布的关于加强农业生产合作社的生产领导和组织建设的指示，全面地提出了解决这些问题的正确方针和具体办法，坚决地贯彻执行这个指示，就一定可以进一步巩固农业生产合作社，发展农业生产。现在，我只就下面三个问题说一些意见。
    一、爱护和发扬农民的劳动积极性
    农业合作化的实现，极大地鼓舞了农民的劳动积极性。在农业生产合作社成立之后，我们遵照中央指示，采取勤俭办社、民主办社、改善劳动组织和生产管理制度、关心社员的物质利益和加强社员的思想教育等办法，发扬了社员的劳动积极性，又实行了一系列的增产措施。因而，今年陕西地区的庄稼一般地都长得好，特别是关中地区的小麦更好。今年关中地区一千七百多万亩麦田（其中有一千四百万亩是旱地），虽然在夏收中遭受了严重的霪雨灾害，但是，小麦总产量仍然达到了四十亿斤以上；平均亩产量二百三十三斤，比大丰收的一九五四年还高出百分之十五以上，并且出现了三十多片千斤以上的高额丰产麦田，获得了多年未有的大丰收。这就有力地证明：去冬今春的农业合作化运动不仅是迅速的，而且是健康的，因而，在实现了农业合作化的第一年，就增加了生产，显示了社会主义合作经济的巨大优越性。这也说明：发扬广大农民的劳动积极性，对于发展农业生产具有多么重要的作用！
    但是，目前并不是所有的农业社都充分地正确地发扬了社员的劳动积极性，相反地，不少的农业社还存在着不爱护甚至挫伤社员劳动积极性的现象。例如：不顾条件地追求大社、大队、大组，而不善于组织大规模的集体劳动，以致生产秩序混乱，形成“派活乱点兵，做活一窝蜂”的现象；只靠命令办事，不和群众商量，有的甚至用“扣工分”、“不派活”的办法来推动工作，以致部分社员产生了“干部怎么说就怎么办”的消极情绪；只管生产，不大关心社员的生活和健康，弄得社员既缺少零用钱，又缺少照料家务和休息娱乐的时间，有的甚至号召社员“把黑夜当白天，把月亮当电灯”，造成过分紧张的状况，以致有人说：“农业社确实好，就是累的人受不了”！
    这些现象的发生，固然同我们的经验不足有关，但主要是由于在胜利形势面前，滋长了盲目乐观和急躁情绪，以为农业合作化以后，农民的劳动积极性很高，一切事情都好办了，似乎我们想怎么办就可以怎么办了。当然，农业合作化的实现，确实为农村工作创造了极为有利的条件，这是主要的一面；但是，新的形势也带来了许多新的问题，如果我们的想法和做法不符合实际情况，依然不会把事情办好。随着所有制的改变，社员的劳动积极性确实是大大地提高了，这就要求农业社的劳动组织和生产管理工作，必须适应这种变化；否则就不能保持和充分发扬社员的劳动积极性。而社员劳动积极性的高度发扬，还必须充分发扬农业社内部的民主；如果过分地片面地强调了集中统一，忽视了发扬民主，甚至对社员限制过多过死，就会抑制社员的劳动积极性。当然，发扬社员的劳动积极性的根本保证是增加生产，增加社员的收入；但是，如果只管生产，不关心社员的日常生活，也会使社员的劳动积极性受到损伤。因此，要能充分发挥农民群众在生产中的巨大作用，就必须从各方面切实地改进农业社的领导。我们体会到：越是胜利就越需要谦虚谨慎，越需要发扬民主；群众的劳动积极性越高，就越需要十分爱护和正确地发扬他们的劳动积极性。
    二、运用现代科学成就，总结老农老圃的生产经验
    实践证明：现代农业科学对于农业生产的发展具有特别重要的作用。例如：西北农学院赵洪璋教授培育的“碧蚂一号”小麦良种，经过重点试验，多点示范的过程，目前已在陕西地区普遍推广；这个良种使小麦产量提高了百分之二十以上。陕西农业综合试验站赵济民同志培育的“五四号”小麦，两年来试种的结果，产量比“碧蚂一号”还高出百分之十三以上。对小麦吸浆虫等毁灭性的虫害，已能采用科学方法控制其发生与蔓延。农业合作化以后，技术改革更加重要也比较容易实行了，群众更迫切地向我们要技术指导。而我们有些干部却缺乏必要的生产知识，常常不能正确地解决生产上的具体问题。群众批评我们“旧的我懂你不懂，新的我不懂你也不懂”，是“外行领导内行”。为了改变这种情况，就需要农业工作者和农村工作者迅速掌握生产知识，而这就必须把努力钻研现代农业科学同认真地学习和总结老农老圃的生产经验这两个方面正确地结合起来。目前，许多干部对学习现代科学知识已经引起了注意，这是很好的现象，但是对于学习和总结老农老圃的生产经验却不够重视，甚至认为现在是原子能时代，无须向老农老圃学习。在这种思想的支配下，就不重视记载在文献中和流传在群众中的农业知识，甚至农历上许多有用的农谚也被当作迷信的东西打倒了。毫无疑义，现代科学是必须努力钻研的，否则，就很难对农业实行技术改革，进一步发展农业生产。但是，农民群众的生产经验是农业科学的泉源；重视和总结农民群众的生产经验，更能丰富农业科学的内容，并且使农业的技术改革能够适应各个地区的不同条件。特别是我国的农业具有三千多年的历史，早在两千年西汉时代就有了比较系统的农学著述，农学遗产是极为丰富的。忽视了这些宝贵的遗产，不仅是我国的重大损失，而且也是人类科学宝库中的重大损失。自然，群众的经验是有某些过时的和不科学的成分，不加分析地全盘接受或一概否定都是不对的。只有重视群众的经验，运用现代的科学成就，去总结它和提高它，才是正确的。轻视群众经验和农学遗产显然是没有任何根据的。拿陕西地区的情况来说，我们的祖先在战国时代就在关中平原建设了我国历史上最古老的渠道之一——“郑国渠”，在汉唐时代又利用泾、渭、滻、灞、沣、洛、潏、?等自然水源，建设了“八水绕长安”的灌溉系统。这个地区的农民在长期的生产劳动中，积累了丰富的耕作经验。例如：农民中许多年来就有“母壮子肥”的选种经验（亩产八百斤籽棉的“铁猴棉”良种，就是陕西泾阳农民孟文喜选育出来的）；有“麦收隔年墒”的保墒和冬灌经验；有“底肥三年壮”的施肥经验；有实行条播的习惯；有采用倒茬和调换抗虫品种等办法来防治吸浆虫的经验。我们正是总结和推广了群众中的这些经验，并从科学技术方面给以及时的指导，才有效地推行了技术改革。相反地，凡是不重视群众经验、不听取群众意见的，就使工作受到了损失。今年夏收中的损失，就是一个很大的教训。过去在麦收季节，关中地区一些做大庄稼的农民，原有“活割一些，熟割一些，干割一些”的合理安排收割时间的经验，也有请小麦早熟和晚熟地区的农民来帮助抢收的习惯。农业合作化以后，几亩几十亩的小面积生产变成了几百亩几千亩的大面积生产；加上关中地区普遍种植了“碧蚂一号”小麦良种，成熟期一致，因此，采用上述经验更好地组织劳动力进行抢收就更加重要。但是，我们在今年夏收以前，却没有重视这些经验，没有及时地指导农业社组织好劳动力进行抢收，以致延误了收割时机，使小麦遭受雨灾，产量和质量都受到了损失。可见，不重视和总结群众经验的危害是很大的。
    三、坚持说服教育，启发群众的自觉
    正确的生产计划和增产措施的制定，必须经过周密的调查研究；而生产计划和增产措施的实现，又必须向群众进行充分的说服教育工作，使群众自觉自愿地行动起来。没有群众的自觉自愿的行动，任何事情都是办不好的。我们向群众进行说服教育的时候，主要是采取了以群众教育群众的方法。在农业合作化运动中，不仅组织了大量的宣传员和干部，向群众进行宣传，而且特别注意了组织大量的老社干部向群众作巡回报告，组织新社社员和社外群众到老社参观，向老社社员学习办法。今年以来，我们分别召开了大规模的棉花、玉米等丰产经验交流会和水土保持积极分子大会，并且组织先进生产者向群众介绍生产经验。同时，我们根据农民群众“先看、再试、然后干”的特点，采取了“多点示范”、“互教互学”的方法，培养了推广良种、实行密植和防治病虫害等各种典型单位和典型人物。有些地方并且采取“县县有点，区区来人；区区有点，乡乡来人；乡乡有点，村村来人”的办法，组织观摩，进行推广。事实证明：这种用群众自己的切身经验教育群众的方法，是最有说服力的。但是，我们有些同志却不善于采用说服教育的工作方法，更不善于用群众自己的经验来教育群众。特别是农业合作化以后，千百万分散的个体农民参加到农业社里，头绪少了，容易抓了，推广技术措施也比较容易了。于是，有些同志就想用简单的行政命令来代替艰苦的说服教育工作。有的主观地制定不切合实际的增产指标和技术定额，而又机械地要群众执行。有的甚至订下统一的生产进度表，要求情况不同的农业社一律在某几天下种，某几天收割，以致群众说这些干部是“铁政策，死脑筋”。因此，强调从实际出发，强调说服教育的工作方法，在目前具有特别重要的意义。
    像以上这类性质的问题，不仅在我们农业生产的领导工作中是存在的，而且在其他工作中也是存在的。为了从根本上解决这些问题，我们正在组织干部，认真学习中央规定的“改造我们的学习”等五个文件；通过这次学习，使新老干部了解和重温这些文件的精神，不断地克服主观主义、官僚主义和宗派主义的毛病。同时，组织干部学习和领导生产的科学知识和先进经验。通过这些措施，加强党对城市和农村工作的领导，发展工农业生产，做好各项工作。
    党的第八次代表大会给了我们无限的力量，我们一定遵循大会的精神，更加紧密地团结全党和全省人民，保证大会决议完满地实现。
