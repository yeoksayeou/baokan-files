    Autumn Harvest Distribution Plan Involving Deception of Superiors and Subordinates
    Pu Jian
    On the morning of July 17, the Baoying County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Jiangsu Province held a three-level cadre meeting with keynote speeches. The speaker from the Yuezhi First Agricultural Production Cooperative in Wangzhi Township was Wu Changsong, a district committee cadre stationed in the cooperative. The topic was: "How to formulate an autumn trial calculation plan." All six hundred and forty-seven county, district, and township cadres in the venue listened attentively, eager to learn from their experience in formulating an autumn distribution trial calculation plan. The speech did introduce many "experiences" and showcased production achievements. The main points were: "Arranging production, preparing for the autumn harvest, reviewing the summer pre-distribution policy, affirming the autumn yield, calculating an average yield of 434.8 jin per mu for first and second crops, and estimating that each cooperative member would earn more than 1.2 yuan per labor day." It also stated: "To ensure the accuracy of the plan, the cooperative committee publicized it from top to bottom, layer by layer, and organized cooperative members to discuss it by production team. After the plan was announced, cadres and members were highly motivated..." This speech was met with enthusiastic applause.
    Logically, a district committee cadre stationed in a cooperative, speaking at a county committee's three-level cadre meeting, should be trustworthy. However, the reality was quite different. Consider the facts:
    The so-called review of the summer pre-distribution policy was merely a repetition of issues identified before the summer pre-distribution, without any actual review of the policy. As for the yield, the speech stated an average yield of 434.8 jin per mu for first and second crops. In reality, the already harvested early rice yielded an average of only 260-270 jin per mu. Later, based on actual estimations by cadres and members, the late rice yield was approximately 300 jin per mu, resulting in a total average of about 315 jin and 10 liang for first and second crops. The speech stated that each labor day would earn more than 1.2 yuan, but in reality, it would only be slightly more than 1.07 yuan (this figure was based on the later revised plan).
    As for the claim of publicizing the plan layer by layer and organizing cooperative members for discussion, it was even more ludicrous. This plan was solely managed by Wu Changsong, who enlisted the help of two accountants for calculations and writing. After it was completed, only a copy was given to cooperative leader Tao Dewu, and the two deputy leaders were only briefly informed. How could there have been discussions with team cadres and cooperative members?
    It turned out that Yuezhi First Cooperative was the district committee's key point cooperative. When the county committee announced the three-level cadre meeting, Wu Changsong, the stationed cadre, became busy. The responsible cadres in the cooperative were preoccupied with harvesting early rice and couldn't spare the time. He then took the two accountants to the district, where they worked on the plan for three or four days. Tao Dewu, the cooperative leader, learned at home that the yield figures mentioned in the meeting were incorrect and that other aspects were also inaccurate, causing him great anxiety. Wu Changsong returned and told Tao: "The plan has already been discussed in the county. Let's do this: that plan remains as it is, and the cooperative will draft a new one!" Only then was a more reliable plan re-drafted.
    We might imagine: if the Baoying County Committee had believed Wu Changsong's reported plan to be true, and the responsible cadres of Yuezhi First Cooperative had simply gone along with it, what would have been the consequences?

    欺上瞒下的秋收分配方案
    蒲剑
    7月17日上午，中共江苏省宝应县委召开的三级干部大会，举行大会发言，望直乡月蛅第一农业生产合作社的发言人是区委驻社干部吴长松。题目是：“怎样制定秋季试算方案”。会场上六百四十七个县、区、乡干部都屏声静气地听着，要学习他们制定秋季分配试算方案的经验。发言中确实介绍了不少“经验”，也摆出了生产成绩。要点是：“安排生产，做好秋收准备，检查夏季预分政策，肯定秋季产量，算出一二熟田平均产量四百三十四点八斤，社员每个劳动日得一元二角多。”还说：“为了使方案订得正确，社委会将这个方案由上而下，层层公布，并以大队为单位，组织社员讨论。方案公布以后，干部和社员劲头都很大，……”这个发言，博得一场热烈鼓掌。
    照理说，既是一个区委驻社干部，又是在县委的三级干部大会上发言，无论如何不会有假了，其实不然，请看看事实吧：
    所谓检查夏季预分政策，不过是把夏季预分前发现的一些问题重说一遍，实际上根本没有检查夏季预分政策。再看产量，发言中说一二熟田平均产量四百三十四点八斤，实际上，已收下的一千多亩早稻平均每亩只收二百六、七十斤，以后根据干部、社员实际估算，晚稻每亩约三百多斤，一二熟总平均约三百一十五斤十两。发言中说每个劳动日分一元二角多，实际上只能分一元零七分多（这个数字是以后方案订出的）。
    至于说层层公布，组织社员讨论，那就更滑稽了。这个方案是由吴长松一手主办，叫两个会计帮助他算算写写弄出来的。弄好以后，丢一分给社长陶德伍，另外两个副社长只给说了一下，还能谈到队干部和社员讨论吗？
    原来，月蛅一社是区委的基点社。县委通知开三级干部会议，驻社干部吴长松就忙起来了。社里负责干部正忙收早稻，分不开身来，他便把两个会计找到区里，整整弄了三、四天。社长陶德伍在家里知道了他在会上说的产量有问题，其他事情也不对头，心中很急；吴长松回来后向陶说：“方案在县里已经谈过了，这样吧，那个方案归那个方案，另外社里重新再订个吧！”后来才重新订了一个比较可靠的方案。
    我们不妨设想一下，如果宝应县委把吴长松同志所汇报的方案信以为真，月蛅一社的负责干部也将错就错，那么，结果会怎样呢？
