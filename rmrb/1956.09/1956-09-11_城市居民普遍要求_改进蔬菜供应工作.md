    City Residents Universally Demand
    Improvement in Vegetable Supply Work
    A Vegetable Station with Prices but No Goods
    Luoyang
    When you first arrive at the Luoyang City Vegetable Company's vegetable station as a customer, you can clearly see the prices of forty or fifty kinds of vegetables listed on the price board outside the door. Potatoes, celery, onions, cilantro… everything seems to be available, and you can't help but feel satisfied. However, upon entering the station, you are greatly surprised: not only are there only five or six kinds of vegetables, but their quality is also very poor. Buyers have nicknamed them "rotten tomatoes" and "old eggplants." But don't dislike them, because even these vegetables will be gone if you go too late. The phenomenon of vegetable supply falling short of demand is not isolated in Luoyang. The Vegetable Company also has a vegetable station in Lijia Village, where people line up in long queues every morning to buy vegetables. If you go even a little late, you won't be able to buy anything. I think the Luoyang City Vegetable Company is aware of this phenomenon and should actively organize sources of goods, and proactively work with local agricultural leaders to jointly study and improve future vegetable production and sales plans.

    A Long Snake Formation
    An Guang
    Currently, it is the season when green vegetables are on the market in large quantities. Logically speaking, the citizens and employees' families in An Guang County, Jilin Province, which has always cultivated large quantities of vegetables such as eggplants and beans, should be able to satisfy their needs for vegetables. But unexpectedly, not only are vegetables expensive here, but they are also difficult to buy. People have been lining up in a "long snake formation" in front of the supply and marketing cooperative every day as early as four o'clock in the morning, waiting to buy vegetables. The noise of crowding and scrambling prevents nearby residents from sleeping peacefully. On the morning of August 14th, a child over ten years old was almost trampled. Generally, the green vegetables are sold out within an hour of being put on the market every morning, and after seven o'clock, you can forget about buying any vegetables. Therefore, the citizens have summarized their experience of buying vegetables as: "Get up early, carry a big basket, bring change, and squeeze like crazy."
    Can the problem really be this serious? People who have not been to An Guang may have doubts. Our answer is, not only "yes," but it has existed for a long time. This is mainly because the An Guang vegetable market is in a state of neglect, the vegetable department has not actively organized purchases, and although the vegetable prices are twice as high as those in Baichengzi, which is nearly a hundred miles away, the vegetable production cooperatives still emphasize that the prices are low and the profits are small. The commercial departments in An Guang have not taken effective measures to address these problems, which have been delayed until now without being resolved. This is very wrong.

### 城市居民普遍要求  改进蔬菜供应工作

    城市居民普遍要求
    改进蔬菜供应工作
    一个有价无货的菜站
    洛阳
    当你第一次作为顾客来到洛阳市蔬菜公司菜站的时候，在门外就可以清楚地看到牌价板上的四、五十种蔬菜名目。什么土豆、芹菜、洋葱、香菜……样样俱全，你不能不满意。可是，走进室内，却使你大大吃惊：不仅只有五、六种菜，而且质量也很不好。买菜的人给那些菜起名“烂柿子（西红柿），老茄子”。但是，且莫嫌它，去晚了这样的菜也没有。蔬菜供不应求的现象，在洛阳来说还不算个别的。蔬菜公司在李家村还有一个菜站，每天清晨去那里买菜的人排成了很长的队。若是稍去迟一点，什么也买不到。这种现象，我想，洛阳市蔬菜公司是会知道的，应当积极组织货源，主动同当地农业领导机关共同研究，做好今后的蔬菜产、销计划。　段毅
    一字长蛇阵
    安广
    目前，正是青菜大量上市的季节。按理说，一向大量种植茄子、豆角等蔬菜的吉林省安广县城的市民和职工家属，买蔬菜吃总会满足需要的。但出乎人们意料之外，这里的蔬菜不仅价钱高，而且难买着。供销社的门口每天早晨四点多钟就有很多人排成“一字长蛇阵”等着买菜，拥挤、抢购时的叫嚷之声使附近居民不能安安稳稳地睡觉。8月14日的早晨，险些踩坏一个十多岁的孩子。一般情况是每天早晨青菜入市后一个钟头的时间就购买一空，到七点钟以后，就再别想买到菜吃了。因此，市民总结了买菜的经验是：“赶大早，挎大筐，带零钱，拚命挤。”
    问题能这样严重吗？没到过安广的人们会有疑问的。我们答复是，不但“有”，而且长时期存在着。这主要是安广菜市场存在无人管理的状态，蔬菜部门没有积极组织进货，而蔬菜价格虽比相距近百里的白城子高了一倍之多，蔬菜生产社却还强调价格低，利润少。对这些问题，安广的商业部门也没有采取有效措施，以致拖延到今不加解决，这是很不对的。
