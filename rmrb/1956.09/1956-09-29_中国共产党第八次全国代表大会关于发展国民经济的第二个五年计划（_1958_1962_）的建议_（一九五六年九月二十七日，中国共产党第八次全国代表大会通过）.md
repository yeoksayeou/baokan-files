During the period of implementing the First Five-Year Plan in our country, the people of the whole country demonstrated an unprecedented upsurge of socialist enthusiasm, launching a great movement of socialist construction and socialist transformation. Now the socialist transformation movement has achieved a decisive victory, and the socialist construction movement is also proceeding victoriously.

At present, the international situation has definitely tended towards détente. The construction of the great Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries is developing day by day. The unity and cooperation of socialist countries are being strengthened day by day. The people's democratic dictatorship in our country is more consolidated, and all nationalities, democratic parties, and patriotic people are more united. All this has become an extremely favorable condition for further promoting the victorious completion of our country's First Five-Year Plan. According to the construction achievements of the past three years, it is estimated that most of the indicators stipulated in our country's First Five-Year Plan will be overfulfilled, especially the socialist transformation plan will be completed ahead of schedule. When we complete the First Five-Year Plan in 1957, our country will establish a preliminary foundation for socialist industrialization. At the same time, with the exception of individual areas, the cooperativization of agriculture and handicrafts will be basically realized, and the public-private joint ownership of capitalist industry and commerce will be completed.

In view of the imminent and victorious realization of the First Five-Year Plan, the Second Five-Year Plan (1958-1962) for the development of the national economy of our country should be formulated in a timely manner. To this end, the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China proposes the proposal on the Second Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy of our country and submits it to the State Council of the People's Republic of China for discussion. We suggest that the State Council formulate a draft of the Second Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy as soon as possible and submit it to the National People's Congress for deliberation and decision in order to mobilize the people of the whole country to work hard to achieve the various tasks stipulated in the Second Five-Year Plan.

The Second Five-Year Plan is an extremely important key to realizing the general task of our country's transition period. The Second Five-Year Plan must, on the basis of the victorious completion of the First Five-Year Plan, advance socialist construction and complete socialist transformation in a manner that is both active and steady and reliable, ensuring that our country has the possibility of basically building a complete industrial system in about three five-year plans, so that our country can be transformed from a backward agricultural country into an advanced socialist industrial country. Therefore, the basic tasks of the Second Five-Year Plan should be: (1) to continue industrial construction centered on heavy industry, promote the technical transformation of the national economy, and establish a consolidated foundation for socialist industrialization in our country; (2) to continue to complete socialist transformation and consolidate and expand collective ownership and public ownership; (3) on the basis of developing basic construction and continuing to complete socialist transformation, further develop the production of industry, agriculture, and handicrafts, and correspondingly develop the transportation industry and commerce; (4) strive to cultivate construction talents and strengthen scientific research work to meet the needs of socialist economic and cultural development; (5) on the basis of the development of industrial and agricultural production, strengthen national defense and improve the people's material and cultural living standards.

In order to ensure the realization of the above-mentioned basic tasks, it is recommended that the Second Five-Year Plan adopt the following guidelines and deployments for the development and transformation of the national economy:

(1) According to the current domestic and international conditions and the general trend, during the Second Five-Year Plan period, it is necessary and possible for our country's national economy to continue to maintain a relatively high rate of development. The First Five-Year Plan of our country stipulates that the total output value of industry and agriculture in 1957 (including modern industry, handicrafts, and agriculture, the same below) will increase by 51.1% compared with 1952. It is estimated that the result of the implementation may increase by more than 60%. During the Second Five-Year Plan period, due to the successive commissioning of newly built and rebuilt enterprises, the further development of the production potential of existing enterprises, the release of equipment potential of private industry after public-private joint ownership and nationalization, and the further improvement of productivity of agriculture and handicrafts after cooperativization, it is required that the total output value of industry and agriculture in 1962 increase by about 75% compared with the 1957 plan (referring to the 1957 plan in the First Five-Year Plan, the same below), of which the industrial output value (including modern industry and handicrafts, the same below) will increase by about 100% compared with the 1957 plan, and the agricultural output value will increase by about 35% compared with the 1957 plan. The above-mentioned development speed of industrial and agricultural production is compared with the figures of the First Five-Year Plan as the base, and the factors that may be overfulfilled are not included in the calculation, so the speed of increase appears to be higher. If the estimated implementation results of the First Five-Year Plan are used as the base for comparison, the above-mentioned growth rate of the Second Five-Year Plan will be relatively lower.

The First Five-Year Plan of our country stipulates that in the 1957 industrial output value plan, the means of production industry accounts for 38% and the consumer goods industry accounts for 62%. It is estimated that the proportion of the means of production industry may reach more than 40%. During the Second Five-Year Plan period, the growth rate of the means of production industry will still be higher than the growth rate of the consumer goods industry. It is required that the means of production industry and the consumer goods industry each account for about 50% in 1962.

(2) Due to the growth of industrial and agricultural production, the improvement of labor productivity, and the practice of thrift in various sectors of the national economy, the national income in 1962 may increase by about 50% compared with 1957. During the Second Five-Year Plan period, the proportional relationship between consumption and accumulation in the national income should be correctly handled. The proportion of accumulation in the national income may be slightly higher than the level already reached in the first five years, in order to accelerate socialist construction and ensure the gradual improvement of people's lives.

During the Second Five-Year Plan period, with the increase of national income and the increase of the proportion of the state-owned economy in the national income, the state's financial revenue will increase more than in the first five years. Fiscal expenditure must be adapted to fiscal revenue, ensure the balance of fiscal revenue and expenditure, and maintain a certain reserve force to cope with unexpected difficulties that may be encountered. At the same time, credit funds should be increased accordingly to maintain the balance of credit revenue and expenditure.

During the Second Five-Year Plan period, on the premise of strengthening national defense and improving administrative efficiency, the expenditure on national defense and administrative expenses should be reduced as much as possible, and the expenditure on economic construction and cultural construction should be increased to ensure the accelerated progress of socialist construction. In the total fiscal expenditure of the Second Five-Year Plan, the expenditure for economic and cultural construction should be increased from about 56% of the First Five-Year Plan to 60-70%; the expenditure for national defense and administrative expenses should be reduced from about 32% of the First Five-Year Plan to about 20%; other parts are used for national material reserves, credit funds, repayment of domestic and foreign debts, and general reserve funds.

During the Second Five-Year Plan period, on the basis of increased fiscal revenue, in order to accelerate socialist construction, the proportion of national basic construction investment in total fiscal expenditure can be increased from about 35% of the first five years to about 40%. In this way, the national basic construction investment in the second five years can be increased by about 100% compared with the first five years. In the total amount of national basic construction investment, the proportion of industrial investment should be increased from 58.2% of the First Five-Year Plan to about 60%; the proportion of investment in agriculture, forestry, and water conservancy should be increased from 7.6% of the First Five-Year Plan to about 10% to ensure the rapid development of the two major sectors of the national economy - industry and agriculture.

(3) The central task of our country's Second Five-Year Plan is still to prioritize the development of heavy industry. This is the main symbol of socialist industrialization, because heavy industry is the foundation for establishing our country's strong economic and defense forces, and it is also the foundation for completing the technical transformation of our country's national economy.

It is required that the main heavy industrial products in 1962 reach approximately the following levels:

| Product Name      | Unit      | 1962 Planned Output | 1957 Planned Output | 1952 Actual Output | Highest Annual Output in History |
|-------------------|-----------|-----------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|------------------------------------|

| Chemical Fertilizer | 10,000 tons| 300-320               | 57.8                  | 19.4                | 1941       | 22.7                  |
| Metallurgical Equipment | 10,000 tons| 3-4                  | 0.8                   | —                    | —         | —                     |
| Power Generation Equipment | 10,000 kW   | 140-150              | 16.4                  | 0.67                | —         | —                     |
| Metal Cutting Machine Tools | 10,000 units| 6-6.5                | 1.3                   | 1.4                 | 1941       | 0.5                   |
| Logs              | 10,000 cubic meters| 3,100-3,400         | 2,000.0              | 1,002.0              | —         | —                     |
| Cement            | 10,000 tons| 1,250-1,450           | 600.0                 | 286.0               | 1942       | 229.3                  |

During the Second Five-Year Plan period, the construction of the machine manufacturing industry, especially the machine manufacturing industry that manufactures industrial equipment, must be vigorously strengthened, and the construction of the metallurgical industry must continue to be expanded to meet the needs of national construction. At the same time, the construction of the power industry, the coal industry, and the building materials industry should also be actively developed, and the construction of the backward sectors in industry - the petroleum industry, the chemical industry, and the radio industry - should be strengthened. The construction of the peaceful use of atomic energy industry should be actively carried out.

Within five years, efforts should be made to strengthen the weak links in the industry and open up new fields, such as the manufacture of various heavy equipment, special machine tools, precision machine tools, and instruments, the production of high-grade alloy steel and the cold processing of steel, the mining and refining of rare metals, the establishment of the organic synthetic chemical industry, etc. At the same time, attention should also be paid to the comprehensive utilization of resources, especially the comprehensive utilization of symbiotic non-ferrous metals.

(4) While prioritizing the development of heavy industry, the construction of light industry should be appropriately accelerated on the basis of agricultural development to meet the growing needs of the vast number of people for consumer goods and increase the country's capital accumulation.

It is required that the main light industrial products in 1962 reach approximately the following levels:

| Product Name     | Unit      | 1962 Planned Output | 1957 Planned Output | 1952 Actual Output | Highest Annual Output in History |
|------------------|-----------|-----------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|------------------------------------|
|                  |           |                       |                       |                      | Year       | Output                |
| Cotton Yarn        | 10,000 bales | 800-900               | 500.0                 | 361.8             | 1933       | 224.7                  |
| Cotton Cloth       | 10,000 bolts | 23,500-26,000         | 16,372.1              | 11,163.4           | —         | —                     |

During the Second Five-Year Plan period, all light industries that are needed by the society and have sufficient raw material supply should fully utilize the production potential of the original equipment, and the proportion of investment in light industry should be appropriately increased. New construction should be carried out according to needs and possibilities to further expand the production of light industry. The light industry sector should strive to increase product varieties, improve quality, and reduce costs to achieve high quality and low prices.

In order to increase light industrial products, local industries should make more use of local resources and waste materials to increase the production of various consumer goods suitable for the needs of local people, and exchange goods between various regions. Handicraft industry should continue to be developed on the basis of cooperativization to meet the diverse needs of the people.

(5) During the Second Five-Year Plan period, according to the resource situation and the principle of rational distribution of productive forces, new industrial bases should continue to be established and actively prepared for establishment in the inland areas, so that the economies of all regions of the country can gradually move towards balanced development. However, while carrying out large-scale industrial construction in the inland areas, the original industries in the coastal areas must also be actively and fully utilized and appropriately developed. This is not only to meet the growing needs of the country and the people, but also to support the construction of the inland areas. In industrial basic construction, attention should be paid to the mutual coordination of large, medium, and small enterprises, and appropriately dispersed in terms of regions.

Within five years, it is required to continue the construction of industrial bases centered on the iron and steel industry in Northeast China, Central China, and Inner Mongolia; begin the construction of new industrial bases centered on the iron and steel industry and hydropower stations in Southwest China, Northwest China, and the surrounding areas of Sanmenxia; continue the construction of the petroleum industry and non-ferrous metal industry in Xinjiang; actively give play to the role of the original industrial base in East China; fully give play to the industrial role in North China and South China; strengthen geological exploration in Tibet to prepare conditions for the development of industry in Tibet.

In order to ensure the completion of the above-mentioned construction tasks, geological work must be further strengthened to provide various mineral reserves and geological data required for economic construction; the training of our country's design forces should be accelerated, and the construction and installation teams should be strengthened. At the same time, urban construction should be strengthened to meet the needs of industrial development.

(6) Agricultural production must be vigorously developed so that the development of agriculture and the development of industry can be coordinated with each other to meet the needs of the country and the people.

During the Second Five-Year Plan period, priority should be given to ensuring the increase in grain production and promoting the development of the entire agriculture; at the same time, ensuring the increase in the production of major cash crops, especially cotton and soybeans, and promoting the development of light industry. In agricultural development, diversified operations should also be encouraged, so that animal husbandry, forestry, aquaculture, and sideline occupations of farm households can all have greater development, ensuring that farmers' incomes are increased and people's living standards are improved.

It is required that the main agricultural products in 1962 reach approximately the following levels:

| Product Name | Unit     | 1962 Planned Output | Total for the Second Five Years | 1957 Planned Output | 1952 Actual Output | Highest Annual Output in History |
|-------------|----------|-----------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|------------------------------------|
|             |          |                       |                             |                       |                      | Year       | Output                |
| Grain       | 100 million jin | Around 5,000        | Around 22,000              | 3,631.8              | 3,087.9             | 1936       | 2,773.9               |
| Cotton      | 10,000 dan | Around 4,800        | Around 21,000              | 3,270.0              | 2,607.4             | 1936       | 1,697.6               |
| Soybeans    | 100 million jin | Around 250          | Around 1,100              | 224.4                | 190.4               | 1936       | 226.1                 |

The above-mentioned indicators of major agricultural products should strive to be overfulfilled. At the same time, effective measures are also required to ensure the increase in the production of other oil crops and sugar crops, and efforts should be made to develop the production of silkworms, tea, tobacco leaves, jute, ambary hemp, fruits, medicinal materials, etc. Near cities and industrial and mining areas, increasing the production of vegetables and other non-staple foods to meet the needs of cities and industrial and mining areas should be taken as an important task.

It is required that the number of major livestock in 1962 reach approximately the following indicators:

| Product Name | Unit     | 1962 Planned Quantity | 1957 Planned Quantity | 1952 Actual Quantity | Highest Annual Quantity in History |
|-------------|----------|-----------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|
|             |          |                       |                         |                       | Year     | Quantity                |
| Cattle      | 10,000 heads | Around 9,000        | 7,361                   | 5,660                | 1935    | 4,826.8               |
| Horses      | 10,000 heads | Around 1,100        | 834                     | 613                  | 1935    | 648.5                 |
| Sheep       | 10,000 heads | Around 17,000       | 11,304                  | 6,178                | 1937    | 6,252.0               |
| Pigs        | 10,000 heads | Around 25,000       | 13,834                  | 8,977                | 1934    | 7,853.0               |

Attention should be paid to developing the pig industry to increase the supply of meat and increase manure fertilizer. In addition, the breeding of poultry and livestock such as chickens, ducks, geese, and domestic rabbits should be widely promoted.

In view of the fact that in the first few years of the First Five-Year Plan, soybeans, oil crops, and livestock have not completed the plan, effective measures must be taken to improve this situation during the Second Five-Year Plan period. According to the needs of the country and the people, and according to the natural conditions of various places, the proportion of grain and various cash crops should be arranged in accordance with local conditions, and the production of livestock and sideline occupations should be arranged to ensure the coordinated development of various parts of agriculture.

Agricultural production cooperatives should implement the model regulations of advanced agricultural production cooperatives and the policy of running cooperatives diligently and thriftily and democratically, rectify and consolidate their organizations, train and select various cadres, and strengthen management and production organization. Under the principle of taking into account the needs of the country and the welfare of farmers, the distribution relationship between the collective and individuals should be reasonably arranged; and without affecting the collective production of the cooperative, the members should be appropriately given the necessary personal freedom to control the working time, allowing farmers to engage in various agricultural and sideline occupations suitable for individual management, in order to further give play to the production enthusiasm of the members and promote the development of agriculture and sideline occupations. In the development of agricultural production cooperatives, blind merging into large cooperatives should be prevented in order to avoid difficulties in management and production organization, which would affect agricultural production.

In order to develop agricultural production, within five years, on the basis of cooperativization, all possible measures to increase production must be actively promoted in order to continue to increase the yield per unit area of grain and various cash crops. The main measures to increase production are: expanding the irrigated area; opening up fertilizer sources and improving the method of using fertilizer; gradually promoting new agricultural tools suitable for local use; promoting improved varieties of crops suitable for local areas and strengthening seed rejuvenation; improving cultivation techniques and farming systems; appropriately expanding the multiple cropping area and reclaiming wasteland near rural areas; appropriately developing high-yield crops; improving the soil, paying special attention to the improvement of red soil and saline-alkali land; vigorously preventing and controlling pests and diseases that harm crops. For the various advanced experiences in increasing production, typical experiments must be carried out, and after gaining experience, they should be gradually promoted in areas with roughly the same conditions to avoid losses caused by blind promotion.

During the Second Five-Year Plan period, water conservancy should be vigorously built, flood control and drainage measures should be strengthened, water and soil conservation should be carried out, efforts should be made to reduce the huge water and drought disasters and gradually eliminate general water and drought disasters. While the state is building large-scale water conservancy projects, the strength of agricultural production cooperatives and the masses should be mobilized to plan and actively build medium and small-scale water conservancy projects, and attention should be paid to utilizing and improving the original water conservancy facilities.

Wasteland in Northeast China, Northwest China, and South China should be reclaimed according to possible conditions to increase the cultivated area, and state-owned farms should be appropriately developed to increase grain and cash crops for the country.

During the Second Five-Year Plan period, forestry should be actively developed, the masses should be mobilized to plant trees, efforts should be made to renew and nurture the cut-over land in state-owned forest areas, the survival rate of afforestation should be improved, forest fires and pests should be prevented, and greening should be gradually realized. The production of marine aquatic products and the aquaculture industry of freshwater and shallow seas should be actively developed, and the investigation and protection of aquatic resources should be strengthened. The construction of meteorological stations should be carried out in a planned way, and the forecasting and warning of weather should be strengthened to prevent natural disasters.

In order to promote the development of agricultural production, industrial, commercial, and transportation departments must strengthen cooperation and collaboration with the agricultural sector, and pay attention to strengthening rural credit work to vigorously support agricultural production.

(7) During the Second Five-Year Plan period, in order to meet the needs of industrial and agricultural production and national defense construction, transportation and postal and telecommunications undertakings should be developed accordingly, new railways, highways, and communication lines should be further built, and waterways and air routes should be opened up. At the same time, the original transportation and postal and telecommunications equipment should be strengthened and improved in a planned way, civilian transportation tools should be fully utilized and appropriately developed, the organization of transportation should be improved, and efforts should be made to improve transportation and communication efficiency.

Within five years, the freight turnover and passenger turnover of railways, highways, waterways, and civil aviation should have corresponding growth.

Within five years, it is required to build 8,000-9,000 kilometers of new railways and complete the main railway lines from Lanzhou to Xinjiang border, Baotou to Lanzhou, Neijiang to Kunming, Chongqing to Guiyang, and Lanzhou to Qaidam. In addition, some connecting lines and railway branch lines serving industrial and mining and forestry will also be built.

Within five years, it is required to build and rebuild approximately 15,000-18,000 kilometers of major highways. At the same time, various regions should build local simple highways, cart roads, and other roads according to local needs and possibilities to gradually expand the local road network.

The number of ships in inland rivers, coastal areas, and oceans should be increased according to transportation needs; port construction should be strengthened, and navigation aids should be added; the navigable mileage of inland rivers should be expanded, and the organization of transportation in trunk streams and tributaries should be strengthened.

The transportation tools and facilities of civil aviation and professional aviation should also be appropriately increased.

The national postal and telecommunications network should be gradually constructed and rebuilt according to the needs of national economic and cultural development.

(8) During the Second Five-Year Plan period, in order to promote the development of industrial and agricultural production and ensure the growing needs of national construction and people's lives, the commercial network should continue to be improved and adjusted, the circulation of commodities should be further expanded, and the procurement and supply of industrial products and agricultural products should be strengthened; at the same time, prices should continue to be stabilized, and unreasonable prices should be gradually adjusted. In the procurement of industrial products, the practice of pricing according to quality and grade and the implementation of selective procurement in some products should be promoted to urge backward factories to improve production, improve product quality, and increase the variety of products.

Within five years, with the growth of people's purchasing power, it is required that the total retail sales of social commodities in 1962 increase by about 50% compared with the 1957 plan. The quantity of daily consumer goods such as grain, meat, aquatic products, edible vegetable oil, sugar, cotton cloth, knitwear, coal, kerosene, etc. sold by state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce to urban and rural people, as well as the quantity of means of production sold to agricultural and handicraft production cooperatives, should have corresponding growth.

Continue to implement the unified purchase and sale of grain, oil, cotton cloth, etc. and the unified purchase policy of cotton to ensure reasonable distribution. The self-retained portion of unified purchase commodities belonging to farmers and the non-unified purchase and sale commodities should be allowed to be bought and sold freely under the unified leadership of the state to expand commodity circulation and facilitate the needs of the people. Outside the state market, some free markets under state leadership should be retained and appropriately developed to activate the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas and supplement the deficiencies of the state market.

The acquisition and supply of export materials should be strengthened to ensure the balance of import and export materials.

The supply of state-allocated materials should be strengthened, the balance between supply and demand should be mastered, the material supply and marketing mechanism should be improved, the allocation of materials should be improved, and the storage of important materials should be strengthened to ensure that national construction can be carried out evenly and in a planned way.

(9) In the process of completing the socialist transformation of industry and commerce, necessary economic restructuring and proper personnel arrangements should be carried out in public-private joint ventures in a planned and step-by-step manner; and the nationalization of public-private joint ventures should be gradually realized as conditions mature. At the same time, the original advantages of these enterprises must be preserved and continued to be promoted to ensure the continuous increase in variety and the continuous improvement of quality.

Excellent employees in public-private joint ventures should be selected to participate in the management of the enterprises; at the same time, the capitalists in these enterprises must be united and educated, and their production technology and useful management experience must be fully utilized to transform them into laborers in name and in fact.

Because small factories and small stores are relatively flexible and easy to adapt to various needs, attention should be paid not to over-concentrate during the economic restructuring process. Those small industrial enterprises that are needed by the society or are reasonably managed should be retained and factories should not be blindly merged to avoid weakening cooperation in various areas. Commerce should adopt diverse business methods and maintain appropriate decentralized management under the leadership of state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce; an appropriate number of small vendors should be preserved in urban residential areas and rural areas to facilitate the daily life needs of residents.

Handicraft production cooperatives should pay attention to rectifying and consolidating organizations, properly arranging production, organizing the supply of raw materials and the sale of products, implementing the principle of "payment according to work," and ensuring that general members can increase their income. The scope of management should be appropriately divided, leadership should be strengthened, and cooperation in various areas should be strengthened. At the same time, attention should also be paid to preserving and continuing to promote the original advantages of these handicrafts, increasing product varieties, and improving product quality. According to needs and possibilities, some handicrafts can be gradually mechanized or semi-mechanized to develop production.

The organization of handicraft production cooperatives should not be over-concentrated, and certain industries should be appropriately decentralized, and some handicraftsmen, especially producers of special handicrafts, should be allowed to continue to operate independently. Handicrafts operated by farmers and whose products are sold locally can be operated by individual farmers or by agricultural production cooperatives according to the actual situation to meet the needs of local residents.

(10) The technical transformation of the national economy should be promoted, first of all, the technical transformation of heavy industry, to rapidly improve the technical level of our country's industry. During the Second Five-Year Plan period, the main industrial and mining enterprises that are newly built and significantly rebuilt in machinery manufacturing, metallurgy, chemical industry, electric power, petroleum, coal, and radio, etc., should adopt advanced technical equipment and utilize the latest scientific achievements according to possible conditions, and strive to master these new technologies in order to advance our country's industry to the track of modern technology. Existing enterprises should fully utilize their original production potential, and improve some backward equipment in a planned and step-by-step manner according to the specific situation to improve the technical level of the original enterprises. All newly built, rebuilt, and original enterprises should effectively and systematically promote advanced experiences and advanced production methods at home and abroad according to the specific conditions of each enterprise to rapidly increase production.

The technical transformation of the national economy must be mainly based on our country's heavy industry, especially the machine manufacturing industry, and adapt to our country's technical strength, financial strength, natural resources, and labor force conditions, and carried out with emphasis and step-by-step. Certain departments that use particularly large amounts of labor should gradually realize mechanization in important operations, key projects, and projects that must adopt mechanical construction, and gradually improve the degree of mechanization; other parts should continue to utilize the huge potential of our country's labor force. The technical transformation of the transportation industry and the postal and telecommunications industry should also be gradually carried out according to the level of industrial development, the possible economic and resource situation, and the needs of transportation and communication.

During the Second Five-Year Plan period, the technical improvement of agriculture should focus on expanding water conservancy irrigation and strengthening flood control and drainage measures, trial-manufacturing and promoting various improved agricultural tools suitable for local use, increasing fertilizer production, improving cultivation techniques, and improving seeds and breeds. At the same time, tractors should be appropriately used for cultivation in state-owned farms, reclamation areas, and some cash crop areas according to specific conditions.

(11) According to the needs of national construction, scientific research should be actively and focusedly developed. During the Second Five-Year Plan period, the advanced scientific and technological achievements of the Soviet Union and other countries should continue to be studied, and the world's most advanced scientific and technological work such as atomic energy science, electronics, automation, and remote control technology should be started in our country, and significant achievements should be made in the research work of other major science and technology fields, so as to strive to approach the advanced level in the world in many important science and technology departments during the Third Five-Year Plan period.

Within five years, the scientific research institutions of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, various business departments, and universities and colleges should be strengthened step-by-step and focusedly, and the division of labor and cooperation between them should be strengthened to gradually establish a national scientific work network.

The Party's policy of uniting, educating, and transforming intellectuals and the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" should be implemented, and intellectuals should be encouraged to think independently and discuss freely. The use of intellectuals should be improved, and attention should be paid to improving their working conditions, giving full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of intellectuals, so as to meet the needs of scientific research and economic and cultural development.

During the Second Five-Year Plan period, construction cadres should be vigorously trained, higher education and secondary vocational education should be vigorously developed, college graduates and teachers should continue to be sent abroad to study subjects that we lack, and spare-time higher education and secondary vocational education should be developed in a planned and step-by-step manner, so as to train more specialized talents needed for national construction. At the same time, attention should be paid to developing workers' technical schools, and various methods should be adopted to strive to train skilled workers.

Higher education should focus on the development of engineering and science, and actively develop normal and agricultural and forestry sciences, and appropriately develop other disciplines. Within five years, it is required that the number of college graduates reach approximately 500,000, an increase of approximately 80% compared with the First Five-Year Plan. In 1962, it is required that the number of students enrolled in universities and colleges reach approximately 850,000, an increase of approximately 100% compared with the 1957 plan.

In order to meet the needs of enrollment in universities and colleges and secondary vocational schools, and to appropriately meet the needs of various departments, factories, and mines to train professional cadres and skilled workers, senior high schools and junior high schools should be actively developed. At the same time, primary school education should be gradually promoted, and attention should be paid to helping agricultural production cooperatives run children's literacy classes to supplement the deficiencies of primary school education.

Illiteracy should be eliminated in all regions of the country, language reform should be promoted in a planned and step-by-step manner, and spare-time primary schools and secondary schools for workers and peasants should be gradually run to ensure the continuous improvement of the cultural level of workers and peasants.

The policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom" should continue to be implemented, literature and art undertakings should be widely developed, literary creation and artistic practice should be promoted in many ways, literary criticism should be carried out, and the work of sorting

    中国共产党第八次全国代表大会关于发展国民经济的第二个五年计划（1958——1962）的建议
    （一九五六年九月二十七日，中国共产党第八次全国代表大会通过）
    在我国实行第一个五年计划的期间，全国人民表现了空前高涨的社会主义积极性，掀起了一个伟大的社会主义建设和社会主义改造的运动。现在社会主义改造运动已经取得了决定性的胜利，社会主义建设运动也正在胜利进行。
    目前，国际形势已经肯定地趋向和缓，伟大的苏联和各人民民主国家的建设日益发展，社会主义各国的团结和合作日益加强，我国人民民主专政更加巩固，全国各民族、各民主党派和一切爱国人士更加团结，这一切就成为进一步推动我国第一个五年计划胜利完成的极其有利的条件。根据过去三年多的建设成就预计，我国第一个五年计划所规定的各项指标，大部分都将超额完成，特别是社会主义改造的计划，更将提前完成。当1957年我们完成第一个五年计划的时候，我国就将建立起社会主义工业化的初步基础；同时除了个别地区以外，将基本上实现农业、手工业的合作化，和完成资本主义工商业的公私合营。
    鉴于第一个五年计划即将胜利实现，我国发展国民经济的第二个五年计划（1958——1962）应该及时拟定。为此，中国共产党第八次全国代表大会提出关于我国发展国民经济的第二个五年计划的建议，提交中华人民共和国国务院加以讨论。我们建议国务院在尽可能快一些的时间内拟出发展国民经济的第二个五年计划草案，提请全国人民代表大会审议决定，以便动员全国人民为实现第二个五年计划所规定的各项任务而努力。
    第二个五年计划是实现我国过渡时期总任务的一个极其重要的关键。第二个五年计划，必须在第一个五年计划胜利完成的基础上，以既积极又稳妥可靠的步骤，推进社会主义的建设和完成社会主义的改造，保证我国有可能大约经过三个五年计划的时间，基本上建成一个完整的工业体系，使我国能够由落后的农业国变为先进的社会主义工业国。因此第二个五年计划的基本任务应该是：（1）继续进行以重工业为中心的工业建设，推进国民经济的技术改造，建立我国社会主义工业化的巩固基础；（2）继续完成社会主义改造，巩固和扩大集体所有制和全民所有制；（3）在发展基本建设和继续完成社会主义改造的基础上，进一步地发展工业、农业和手工业的生产，相应地发展运输业和商业；（4）努力培养建设人材，加强科学研究工作，以适应社会主义经济文化发展的需要；（5）在工业农业生产发展的基础上，增强国防力量，提高人民的物质生活和文化生活的水平。
    为着保证上述基本任务的实现，建议第二个五年计划对国民经济的发展和改造采取如下的方针和部署：
    （一）根据现在国内和国际条件及总的趋势来说，在第二个五年计划期间，我国的国民经济有必要而且也有可能继续保持比较高的发展速度。我国第一个五年计划规定的1957年的工农业总产值（包括现代工业、手工业和农业，下同），比1952年增长51.1％，预计执行的结果，可能增长60％以上。在第二个五年计划期间，由于新建和改建的企业的陆续投入生产，原有企业的生产潜力的进一步发挥，私营工业在公私合营和国有化以后的设备潜力的发挥，农业和手工业在合作化以后的生产力的进一步提高，要求1962年的工农业总产值，比1957年计划（系指第一个五年计划中的1957年计划，下同）增长75％左右，其中，工业产值（包括现代工业和手工业，下同）比1957年计划增长1倍左右，农业产值比1957年计划增长35％左右。上述的工业农业生产的发展速度，都是以第一个五年计划的数字作为基数进行比较的，没有把有可能超额完成的因素计算进去，因而增长的速度显得高些；如果以第一个五年计划预计执行结果作为基数进行比较，这样，上述的第二个五年计划的增长速度将会相对地下降一些。
    我国的第一个五年计划规定，在1957年的工业产值计划中，生产资料工业占38％，消费资料工业占62％；预计执行的结果，生产资料工业的比重可能达到40％以上。在第二个五年计划期间，生产资料工业的增长速度仍然将高于消费资料工业的增长速度，要求1962年生产资料工业和消费资料工业各占50％左右。
    （二）由于工农业生产的增长，劳动生产率的提高和国民经济各部门的厉行节约，1962年的国民收入，有可能比1957年增加50％左右。在第二个五年计划期间，应该正确地处理在国民收入中消费和积累之间的比例关系，积累在国民收入中所占的比重可以稍高于第一个五年已经达到的水平，以便加速社会主义的建设，并且保证人民生活的逐步改善。
    在第二个五年计划期间，随着国民收入的增长，国营经济在国民收入中所占比重的提高，国家的财政收入将比第一个五年有较大的增加。财政支出必须同财政收入相适应，确保财政收支平衡，并且保持一定的后备力量，以便应付可能遇到的意外的困难。同时应该相应地增加信贷基金，保持信贷收支的平衡。
    在第二个五年计划期间，应该在增强国防力量和提高行政效率的条件下，尽可能地缩减国防费用和行政费用的支出，而增加经济建设和文化建设的支出，以保证社会主义建设的加速进行。在第二个五年计划的财政支出总数中，用于经济和文化建设的支出，应该从第一个五年计划的56％左右，提高到60—70％；而用于国防和行政费用的支出，应该从第一个五年计划的32％左右，下降为20％左右；其他部分用于国家的物资储备、信贷资金、归还内外债款和总预备费等。
    在第二个五年计划期间，在财政收入增加的基础上，为着加速社会主义建设，国家的基本建设投资在全部财政支出中所占的比重，可以从第一个五年的35％左右，提高到40％左右。这样，第二个五年国家的基本建设投资，可以比第一个五年大约增加1倍左右。在国家的基本建设投资总额中，工业投资的比重应该从第一个五年计划的58.2％，提高到60％左右；农业、林业、水利投资的比重应该从第一个五年计划的7.6％，提高到10％左右，以保证国民经济中的两个主要部门——工业和农业的迅速发展。
    （三）我国第二个五年计划的中心任务仍然是优先发展重工业，这是社会主义工业化的主要标志，因为重工业是建立我国强大的经济力量和国防力量的基础，也是完成我国国民经济的技术改造的基础。
    要求1962年主要的重工业产品大约达到如下水平：

    在第二个五年计划期间，必须大力加强机器制造工业、特别是制造工业设备的机器制造工业的建设，继续扩大冶金工业的建设，以适应国家建设的需要。同时还应该积极地发展电力工业、煤炭工业和建筑材料工业的建设，加强工业中的落后部门——石油工业、化学工业和无线电工业的建设。和平利用原子能工业的建设，应该积极地进行。
    五年内，应该努力加强工业中的薄弱环节，开辟新的领域，例如各种重型设备、专用机床、精密机床和仪表等的制造，高级合金钢的生产和钢材的冷加工，稀有金属的开采和提炼，有机合成化学工业的建立等等。同时还应该注意资源的综合利用，特别是共生有色金属的全面利用。
    （四）在优先发展重工业的同时，应该在农业发展的基础上，适当地加速轻工业的建设，以适应广大人民对消费品的日益增长的需要，并且增加国家的资金积累。
    要求1962年主要的轻工业产品大约达到如下水平：
    产品名称  计算单位  1962年计划产量  1957年计划产量  1952年实际产量  历史上最高年产量
                                                                        年份    产量
    棉纱       万件      800—900           500.0         361.8         1933   224.7
    棉布       万匹      23，500—26，000   16，372.1    11，163.4       —    —

    在第二个五年计划期间，凡是社会所需要和原料供应充足的轻工业，都应该充分发挥原有设备的生产潜力，并且应该适当地提高轻工业的投资比重，按照需要和可能进行新的建设，以进一步扩大轻工业的生产。轻工业部门应该努力增加产品品种，提高质量，降低成本，做到物美价廉。
    为了增加轻工业产品，地方工业应该更多地利用当地的资源和废料，增产适合于当地人民需要的各种消费品，并且在各地区之间互通有无。应该在合作化的基础上，继续发展手工业，以满足人民的多方面的需要。
    （五）在第二个五年计划期间，必须根据资源情况和合理分布生产力的原则，在内地继续建立和积极准备建立新的工业基地，使全国各地区经济逐步走向平衡发展。但是在内地进行大规模工业建设的同时，还必须积极地、充分地利用并且适当地发展近海各地原有的工业，这不但是为着适应国家和人民日益增长的需要，而且也是为着支援内地的建设。在工业基本建设中，应该注意大、中、小型企业的相互配合，并且在地区上做到适当地分散。
    五年内，要求继续进行东北、华中和内蒙古地区的以钢铁工业为中心的工业基地的建设；开始进行西南、西北和三门峡周围地区以钢铁工业、水电站为中心的新工业基地的建设；继续进行新疆地区石油工业和有色金属工业的建设；积极发挥华东地区原有工业基地的作用；充分发挥华北地区和华南地区在工业上的作用；加强西藏地区的地质勘探工作，以便为发展西藏地区的工业准备条件。
    为着保证上述建设任务的完成，必须进一步加强地质工作，提供经济建设所需要的各种矿产储量和地质资料；加紧培养我国的设计力量，加强建筑和安装队伍。同时应该加强城市建设工作，适应工业发展的需要。
    （六）必须大力发展农业生产，使农业的发展同工业的发展互相协调，满足国家和人民的需要。
    在第二个五年计划期间，应该首先保证粮食的增产，推动整个农业的发展；同时保证主要经济作物特别是棉花、大豆等的增产，推动轻工业的发展。在农业发展中，还应该鼓励多种经营，使畜牧业、林业、水产养殖业和农家副业等都有较大的发展，保证增加农民的收入，提高人民的生活水平。
    要求1962年主要的农业产品大约达到如下水平：
    产品名称  计算单位  1962年计划产量  第二个五年合计  1957年计划产量  1952年实际产量  历史上最高年产量
                                                                                         年份    产量

    应该选拔公私合营企业中的优秀职工参加企业的管理工作；同时必须注意团结和教育这些企业中的资方人员，充分利用他们的生产技术和有用的经营管理经验，把他们改造成为名副其实的劳动者。
    由于小厂、小店比较机动灵活，容易适应各方面的需要，因此在经济改组过程中，应该注意到不要过分集中。对那些社会需要或者经营合理的小型工业企业应该保留下来，不要盲目并厂，以免削弱各方面的协作配合。商业更应该采取多样的经营方式，在国营商业和合作社商业的领导下，保持适当的分散经营；要在城市居民区和农村中保存适当数量的小商小贩，以便利居民日常生活的需要。
    手工业生产合作社应该注意整顿和巩固组织，妥善地安排生产，组织原料供应和产品销售，贯彻执行“按劳付酬”的原则，保证一般社员能够增加收入。应该适当地划分管理范围，加强领导，加强各方面的配合。同时还应该注意保存和继续发扬这些手工业原来的优点，增加产品品种，提高产品质量。根据需要和可能，对一部分手工业可以逐步地实行机械化或者半机械化，以发展生产。
    手工业生产合作社的组织也不宜过分集中，某些行业还应该适当分散，并且容许一部分手工业者、特别是特种手工艺品的生产者继续独立经营。农民兼营的而其产品又在本地销售的手工业，可以根据实际情况由农民个人经营，或者由农业生产合作社经营，以满足当地居民的需要。
    （十）应该推进国民经济的技术改造，首先是进行重工业的技术改造，迅速提高我国工业的技术水平。在第二个五年计划期间，新建和重大改建的机器制造、冶金、化学、电力、石油、煤炭和无线电等主要的工矿企业，应该根据可能条件，采用先进的技术设备和利用最新的科学成就，努力掌握这些新技术，以便把我国的工业推进到现代化技术的轨道上。原有企业应该充分利用其原有的生产潜力，并且根据具体情况，有计划、有步骤地改善某些落后设备，提高原有企业的技术水平。一切新建、改建和原有的企业，都应该根据各个企业的具体条件，有效地和有计划地推广国内外的先进经验和先进生产方法，以迅速增加生产。
    国民经济的技术改造，必须主要建立在我国的重工业、特别是机器制造工业的基础上，并且同我国的技术力量、财政力量、自然资源和劳动力等条件相适应，有重点、有步骤地进行。某些使用劳动力特别多的部门，应该在重要作业、重点工程和必须采用机械施工的工程方面逐步实现机械化，并且逐步提高机械化的程度；其他部分，应该继续利用我国劳动力的巨大潜力。运输业和邮电业的技术改造，也应该根据工业发展水平，经济、资源的可能情况和运输、通讯的需要逐步地进行。
    在第二个五年计划期间，农业的技术改进，应该着重扩大水利灌溉和加强防洪排涝措施，试制和推广适合当地使用的各种改良农具，增产肥料，改进耕作技术，改良种籽和畜种等。同时应该根据具体条件，在国营农场、垦荒区和若干技术作物区，适当地使用拖拉机耕种。
    （十一）根据国家建设的需要，应该积极地和有重点地发展科学研究事业。在第二个五年计划期间，应该继续学习苏联和其他国家先进的科学技术成就，在我国开始建立原子能科学、电子学、自动化和远距离操纵技术等世界上最先进的科学技术工作，并且在其他主要的科学技术的研究工作方面做出显著的成绩，以便争取在第三个五年计划期间在许多重要的科学和技术部门接近世界上的先进水平。

    应该积极地发展电影事业，有计划地和有步骤地发展出版事业和广播事业。
    （十二）应该正确地调整中央同地方的关系。各项经济事业和文化事业都应该在中央的统一领导下，根据国家计划，充分地发挥各地方、各业务部门和各基层单位的积极性，广泛地动员群众的力量，以求得社会主义建设尽可能快一些的发展。
    应该根据统一领导、分级管理、因地制宜、因事制宜的原则，改进国家的行政体制，划分企业、事业、计划和财政的管理范围，适当地扩大各省、自治区、直辖市的管理权限，并且注意改进和加强中央各部门的工作。各地方行政管理权限的扩大，一方面可以使地方担负起更多的责任，更大地发挥积极因素和生产潜力；另一方面，又可以使中央各部门集中力量，更多地进行全面规划，研究方针政策，掌握主要业务，加强工作检查，组织经验交流，因而又可以加强中央的领导。
    各地方应该根据国家计划的要求和当地的具体情况，制订地方的经济发展计划。各地方首先应该加强对农业生产的领导；同时应该在全国平衡和地方平衡相结合的条件下，进行必要的工业建设，加强对地方工业和手工业的领导。地方工业和手工业的发展，应该主要为当地人民、特别是当地农民的需要服务；同时生产出口需要和国内其他地区需要的产品，生产各种建筑材料，并且为中央国营工业组织加工和协作生产。
    各地方还必须注意改进本地区的工业品、农产品和土产品的收购工作，增加消费品和农业、手工业所需的生产资料的供应，以促进生产发展，满足人民需要。同时必须按照需要和可能改进地方的交通运输条件，发展教育、文化和卫生事业。
    （十三）为了促进各少数民族地区的经济事业和文化事业的发展，必须加强少数民族地区的建设工作，逐步地改变少数民族地区的落后状况。
    在少数民族地区，应该根据需要和可能有计划地有准备地发展当地的工业。应该注意帮助发展少数民族地区的农业、林业和畜牧业，逐步地进行水利建设和农业、林业、畜牧业的技术改进。有步骤地发展少数民族地区的运输、邮电、商业和银行信贷事业。同时注意发展少数民族地区的文化教育事业，大力培养少数民族的干部和科学技术人员，帮助创造和改革少数民族的文字，帮助建立医疗卫生机构和电影放映队，并且加强少数民族文字出版物的发行工作。
    少数民族地区的社会改革，应该根据各民族人民和公众领袖的意愿和当时当地的具体条件有步骤、有准备地进行，以适应当地经济文化事业发展的需要。
    （十四）应该在生产发展的基础上，逐步地提高人民的生活水平。应该正确地处理劳动生产率提高和职工工资增长之间的比例关系，正确地处理农业生产合作社的收益分配；合理地安排劳动力，逐步地消除城市中的失业现象。
    在第二个五年计划期间，应该努力提高劳动生产率，要求五年内工业部门和建筑部门的劳动生产率各提高50％左右。五年内，国民经济各部门的工人和职员的人数将增加600万到700万人。
    应该在保证劳动生产率提高的基础上逐步增加工资，五年内工人和职员的平均工资将增加25—30％。应该适当地缩短在有害健康条件下作业的工人和职员的工作时间。
    应该进一步改善工人和职员的居住条件，适当地增加住宅的建设，逐步地改善城市居民的交通条件和城市的服务业。逐步地改进和增设托儿所和幼儿园，改善企业、事业、机关的食堂。切实加强劳动保护、工矿卫生和技术安全的设施，保障工人生产的安全；积极采取措施，减少和消除几种危害比较严重的职业病。特别应该注意改善井下、高温、野外、高空等作业的工作人员的劳动条件和妇女的劳动条件。扩大劳动保险的实施范围，改进劳动保险制度。
    在第二个五年计划期间，除了有特大的自然灾害以外，应该在农业增产的基础上，争取做到一般社员能够增加收入，以提高农民的生产积极性。五年内，随着农业生产的增长，农民的全部收入可能增长25—30％。
    农业生产合作社的公益金应该合理使用，保证全部用在社员的劳动保护和生活福利方面。
    五年内，随着手工业生产的发展，手工业生产合作社社员的收入也应该有相应的增长。
    在第二个五年计划期间，应该进一步发展保健事业，适当地增加医院和疗养院的床位和医疗保健机构，逐步地推广乡村简易病床，加强对疾病的预防工作和农村医疗工作，并且有计划地培养医务工作人员，做好中医和西医的相互学习的工作，认真地进行中医、中药的整理研究工作，大力地防治危害人民最严重的疾病。
    应该有步骤地广泛开展群众性的体育运动，以增强人民的体质。在开展体育运动中，应该照顾人民的体力条件，不使负担太重，以免得到相反的结果。
    （十五）在第二个五年计划期间，为着增加资金积累，加速社会主义建设，应该继续贯彻执行增产节约的原则，实行严格的节约制度。
    五年内，由于生产的迅速增长和基本建设规模的扩大，国民经济各部门对物资、资金和干部的需要将日益增加。同时由于人民物质生活水平的不断提高，他们对消费品的需要也将有新的增长。因此必须努力增加生产，并且继续发扬勤俭建国和艰苦奋斗的优良传统，节约人力、物力、财力的使用，并且把增产节约作为我国社会主义建设中一个长期的、经常的任务。
    在第二个五年计划期间，各工业部门、运输部门和商业部门应该进一步降低生产成本、运输成本和商品流通费用。基本建设部门应该在建筑工程中，继续贯彻执行适用、经济和在可能条件下的美观的原则，降低工程造价，提高工程质量。文教卫生部门和国家行政机关等，也应该贯彻执行精简节约的原则，节省开支，反对铺张浪费。
    （十六）苏联和各人民民主国家对我国的援助，是我国建设社会主义的重要条件，因此我国在发展国民经济和建立完整的工业体系的过程中，必须加强同苏联和各人民民主国家之间的国际协作，扩大相互间的经济文化交流和贸易来往，以便实现各兄弟国家之间的相互支援。有了这种包括经济、技术和科学研究等各个方面的分工和协作关系，就可以充分地相互利用各国的物质资源、生产潜力和科学技术成就；就可以加速国民经济的发展，求得以苏联为首的社会主义各国的经济和文化的共同高涨。
    应该根据平等互利的原则，发展我国同不同社会制度的各国，特别是同亚非各国的经济合作、贸易来往、文化和技术的交流，以利各国人民的和平共处和经济发展。
    中国共产党第八次全国代表大会认为，我国发展国民经济的第二个五年计划，将是促进我国经济和文化进一步全面高涨的计划。这个计划的实现，将使我国有可能更大地增强经济力量和国防力量，提高我国的科学技术水平和人民的物质文化生活水平，并且基本上消灭资本主义制度，从而为实现国家在过渡时期的总任务奠定巩固的基础。
    为了编好我国的第二个五年计划，国务院各部门和各地区在拟定第二个五年计划草案的时候，必须把各项计划指标放在既积极而又稳妥可靠的基础上，既要充分估计到各种有利条件，反对那种看不到各种潜在力量、低估群众社会主义积极性的右倾保守的偏向；又要充分估计到各种不利的因素和可能发生的困难，反对那种缺乏实际根据、不考虑可能条件、不注意国民经济有计划、按比例发展的急躁冒进的偏向。
    根据第一个五年计划的执行情况来看，长期计划中有许多因素是一时难以预料的，特别是农业生产计划的执行，在目前和今后一个较长时间内，还很难避免自然灾害的侵袭，而农业生产计划完成的好坏，对我国整个国民经济计划的执行又有着重大的影响。因此在长期计划中应该把指标定得比较稳妥可靠；但在年度计划中，就应该根据可能条件，积极地发挥潜在力量，以保证长期计划的完成和超额完成。
    拟定第二个五年计划草案是一件十分繁重复杂而且具有伟大意义的工作。因此中国共产党各级党的组织应该积极地、实事求是地协同政府机关做好编制第二个五年计划草案的工作，并且组织群众广泛讨论，反对工作中的主观主义和官僚主义，保证我国的第二个五年计划能够符合实际情况和国家在过渡时期总任务的要求，以指导我国社会主义建设事业的胜利发展。
    中国共产党第八次全国代表大会号召：全党同志应该在党中央委员会和毛泽东同志的领导下，继续努力，进一步团结全国各族人民、各民主党派、各人民团体、国外华侨和一切爱国人士，继续巩固和扩大人民民主统一战线，为超额完成我国第一个五年计划和积极准备第二个五年计划而奋斗。
