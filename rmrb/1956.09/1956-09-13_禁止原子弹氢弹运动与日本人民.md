    The Movement to Ban Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and the Japanese People
    By An Jingyi,
    Secretary-General of the Second World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs

    In August 1956, on the eleventh anniversary of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki by the United States, we held the Second World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs in Tokyo and Nagasaki. Representatives from many countries attended this conference, and the Chinese side sent a strong delegation headed by Ms. Xu Guangping. This is the profound and boundless friendship of the Chinese people towards the Japanese people, and we are truly grateful. I am very happy to be able to ask the Chinese delegation to take back my words and convey them to the dear Chinese people.

    I would like to take this opportunity to briefly introduce the development of the Japanese movement to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs.

    The Japanese people, who suffered the atomic bombings by the United States in Hiroshima and Nagasaki eleven years ago, have gone through so much suffering! No Japanese person does not hate the United States for its inhumane use of weapons of mass destruction. But in the early days, because Japan was a defeated nation and was under the control of the American occupation forces, most people dared to be angry but did not dare to speak out. In 1950, when the Stockholm Appeal calling for a ban on atomic bombs was collecting signatures in Japan, it could only mobilize a small number of people. But on March 1, 1954, due to the United States' hydrogen bomb test on Bikini Atoll in the Pacific, Japan suffered its third disaster from American atomic weapons, and the Japanese people's anger, which had been suppressed for many years, finally erupted. It was like a dammed flood breaking through a gap, and a "torrent of emotion" from the Japanese people poured out. From this moment on, the conditions for the full-scale development of the Japanese people's movement to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs began to mature, and it advanced magnificently in the form of a signature campaign.

    The number of signatures exceeded 10 million in October 1954, exceeded 20 million in December of the same year, and exceeded 30 million by August 1955. On August 6 this year, when the Second World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs was held in Tokyo, the total number of signatures had reached 35,556,308.

    This number fully illustrates the broad scale of the Japanese people's movement to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs. The basic characteristic of this movement lies in the unity of all Japanese people. In this movement, Japanese people from all walks of life have transcended ideological and party lines and united closely to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs. Many housewives, who had never participated in democratic movements before, consciously and enthusiastically participated in this movement and made outstanding contributions to the brilliant victories it has won.

    Due to the adoption of the Vienna Declaration by the World Peace Council in January 1955, the peace signature movement expanded to the whole world. The Vienna Declaration not only called for a ban on atomic and hydrogen bombs, but also called for opposition to preparations for atomic warfare, and the movement began to move forward one step. People all over the world who oppose the preparation for atomic warfare enthusiastically supported the Vienna Declaration. According to the statistics of the World Peace Council, the total number of signatures has exceeded 650 million. China has signed 400 million signatures, making a great contribution to the entire movement. We, the Japanese people, deeply admire this. In addition to the Vienna Declaration, there are also signature campaigns to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs in the United States and other countries. If all the numbers are calculated together, it is estimated that the total number of signatures will be close to 700 million. It can be said that the development of the mass movement on such a grand scale is unprecedented.

    We are of course happy with the successful achievements of the signature campaign, but at the same time, we must fully recognize that collecting signatures is not the purpose of the movement to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs, but only its preparatory stage. This movement has now entered a new stage from the stage of collecting signatures. This new stage is to use the power of the people all over the world, expressed in the signatures, to push the governments of all countries in the direction of banning atomic and hydrogen bombs. A political struggle is beginning. Whether the signature campaign has results depends on whether it can break through the hard "political wall."

    As far as Japan is concerned, the signatures of more than 35 million people have gradually had the power to promote politics. The Japanese Diet respects public opinion, and both houses unanimously passed resolutions to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs. Although the attitude of the Hatoyama government is not active, compared with the Yoshida Shigeru Cabinet, the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister dare not so openly say that they will assist the United States in testing hydrogen bombs and atomic bombs. This is all the power of the Japanese people.

    The problem lies in the international aspect. The key issue at present is how to achieve the effect of the movement to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs in the international situation of forcibly testing atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs. Regarding this issue, the decision of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union to support the decision of the Japanese Diet on banning atomic and hydrogen bombs is of extremely great significance. In the statement of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, this section in particular deserves our attention: The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union welcomes the consensus of the Soviet and Japanese people on the issue of banning atomic and hydrogen bombs, and hopes that the consistent position of the Soviet Union and Japan in this noble cause will also be actively supported by the parliaments of other countries.

    The United States has repeatedly forcibly tested atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs in the Pacific region, but recently it has had to begin to re-examine this issue. The American people also demand a ban on atomic and hydrogen bombs. American international law scholar Aimeri K. Margolis warned: "Only by stopping the Pacific tests that violate international law and humanitarian principles (referring to nuclear weapons tests - translator's note) can the international prestige of the United States be maintained." We believe that under the efforts of the peace-loving American people, the US government will eventually be forced to revise its atomic and hydrogen bomb policy.

    Disarmament is closely related to the ban on atomic and hydrogen bombs. In June 1955, the World Peace Conference held in Helsinki stipulated that August 6th of each year would be "Anti-Atomic Weapons Struggle Day," and decided that on that day, the whole world would jointly demand the complete ban on atomic bombs, hydrogen bombs, and disarmament. The day Hiroshima was bombed by the American atomic bomb has become a memorial day for the whole world, especially on that day, not only is it required to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs, but also disarmament, which is very meaningful. The international situation is developing in this direction. Therefore, all peace activists participating in the movement to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs must correctly understand this point and closely link the movement to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs with disarmament.

    The Second World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs was held under this international situation. The Tokyo Conference was held on August 6th, with the participation of representatives from China and various countries of the world and about 30,000 Japanese people. The Tokyo Declaration was adopted at the meeting. This Tokyo Conference, as a mass gathering, achieved brilliant success. Based on the success of this conference, a three-day conference was convened in Nagasaki from August 9th.

    This Nagasaki Conference was attended by about 3,000 representatives from all over Japan, who, together with representatives from various countries of the world, thoroughly discussed the issue of banning atomic and hydrogen bombs, as well as disarmament and other issues closely related to it. The issue of Okinawa Island, an important atomic and hydrogen bomb base controlled by the United States, was also enthusiastically discussed. As a result of the discussion, the Nagasaki Declaration and seven resolutions were adopted and publicly announced to the world. These declarations and resolutions have made specific instructions for the future direction of the movement to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs.

    The Second World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs was not a meeting between governments of various countries, but a meeting of the people, but it also received congratulatory telegrams and messages from Bulganin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Indian Prime Minister Nehru, and other heads of state from various countries around the world who supported the conference. In particular, Bulganin is the leader of the Soviet Union, a major power that possesses atomic and hydrogen bombs. His congratulatory telegram gave us, the Japanese people, tremendous encouragement.

    Here, I would like to talk about the issue of atomic and hydrogen bomb victims. If we demand a ban on atomic and hydrogen bombs, we must not forget to help those victims who were harmed by the United States' inhumane weapons of mass destruction in the past. The Hiroshima Declaration adopted by the First World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs in August 1955 called on countries around the world to help atomic and hydrogen bomb victims. Countries around the world and people all over Japan actively responded and extended a warm hand. In particular, the six Chinese people's organizations (Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, Red Cross Society of China, China Relief Association, All-China Federation of Trade Unions, All-China Democratic Women's Federation, All-China Youth Federation), on behalf of the entire Chinese people, donated 50,000 yuan in RMB as a consolation fund, which not only moved the atomic and hydrogen bomb victims deeply, but also the entire Japanese people were grateful. These consolation funds are mainly used for the medical treatment and welfare of the victims, and a part is used for the production of a documentary film: "It's Right to Live!" This film is prepared to introduce the real life of atomic and hydrogen bomb victims to countries around the world and the people of Japan.

    The origin of the film's name is because during the First World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, a Hiroshima atomic bomb victim girl, under the warm care of the masses, could not help but say: "It's right to live!" But the real life of atomic and hydrogen bomb victims is still very tragic. Not long ago, a Nagasaki atomic bomb victim girl lost hope of living and committed suicide in pain. This victim girl had gone to Nagasaki Station to welcome representatives from various countries attending the World Conference on the eve of her suicide. When I heard that she had committed suicide, I immediately ran to her home, but when I saw her body, I deeply felt that our movement did not have enough power to prevent such a tragedy from happening, and I felt very painful. We must carry out the movement in depth so that all atomic and hydrogen bomb victims can shout from their hearts: "It's right to live!" Therefore, on the one hand, we must provide meticulous material assistance to the victims, and on the other hand, we must become the spiritual pillar of the victims. At the Second World Conference, the six Chinese people's organizations again donated 50,000 yuan in RMB as a consolation fund, and representatives of the Chinese delegation also sincerely expressed their condolences to the victims. This action, filled with the Chinese people's profound and boundless friendship, paved a new way forward for the movement to help the victims.

    Finally, I would like to talk about another issue. Although we, the Japanese people, strongly condemn the United States for testing and using atomic and hydrogen bombs and resolutely demand a ban on atomic weapons, we have not forgotten Japan's responsibility for launching the Pacific War.

    Because Japanese militarists launched the Pacific War, causing huge losses to the people of various countries, especially the Chinese people, the Japanese people have to deeply reflect and deeply apologize for this. For the sake of war, the Japanese people have also suffered unspeakable disasters and pain. These painful personal experiences have fundamentally changed the Japanese people's view of war. The Pacific War caused a great spiritual revolution, an unconscious peace revolution, among the Japanese people, especially housewives and mothers. They consciously realized from their hearts that in order to defend the lives and happiness of mankind, in order to defend the lives and happiness of the second generation, war must never happen again. The Japanese peace movement has been able to flourish after the war, and its foundation lies here. The Japanese people's demand for a ban on atomic and hydrogen bombs is a link in the movement to defend peace. Of course, we have not forgotten the responsibility for the Pacific War. The call of this Second World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs is also based on this serious self-reflection of the Japanese people.

    We, the Japanese people, sincerely hope to ease the tense situation in Asia and consolidate world peace. The prerequisite for this wish is to restore normal diplomatic relations between China and Japan. The participation of the Chinese delegation in the World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs gave the Chinese and Japanese people a good opportunity to have direct contact and enhance mutual understanding. Taking this opportunity as a starting point, if we can strengthen the peaceful and friendly relations between the two countries, that will be our greatest wish.

    禁止原子弹氢弹运动与日本人民
    第二届禁止原子弹和氢弹
    世界大会秘书长  安井郁
    1956年8月，正当广岛和长崎遭受美国原子弹轰炸的十一周年，我们在东京和长崎举行了第二届禁止原子弹和氢弹世界大会。许多国家代表参加了这一届大会，中国方面派出了以许广平女士为首的强有力的代表团。这是中国人民对日本人民深厚无比的友谊，我们实在感谢。这一次，我能够请中国代表团把我想说的话带回去，向亲爱的中国人民致意，我感到非常高兴。
    我愿意利用这样一个好机会，简单介绍一下日本禁止原子弹和氢弹运动的发展过程。
    十一年前在广岛、长崎遭到美国原子弹轰炸的日本人民，经历了多少苦难的过程！对于美国惨无人道使用大规模杀人武器，没有一个日本人不切齿痛恨。但在初期，因为日本是战败国，受到美国占领军箝制，一般人敢怒而不敢言。1950年，呼吁禁止原子弹的斯德哥尔摩宣言在日本征集签名的时候，也只能动员一小部分人。但是到了1954年3月1日，由于美国在太平洋上比基尼岛试验氢弹，日本第三次受到美国原子武器的灾害，抑压多年的日本人民的怒火终于爆发了。这正像被堵住的洪流冲破缺口一样，涌出了一股日本人民的“感情的巨流”。从这个时候，日本人民禁止原子弹和氢弹运动全面开展的条件开始成熟，它以签名运动的形式波澜壮阔地向前推进。
    签名数字，1954年10月超过一千万，同年12月，超过二千万，到1955年8月，超过了三千万。在今年8月6日，东京举行第二届禁止原子弹和氢弹世界大会的时候，签名总数已经达到了三千五百五十五万六千三百零八人。
    这个数字充分说明了日本人民禁止原子弹和氢弹运动规模的广阔。这个运动的
  基本的特点，就在于全日本人民的团结一致。在这个运动中，各阶层的日本人民都超越思想和党派的界限，为禁止原子弹和氢弹而紧紧地团结在一起。很多家庭妇女，从来没有参加民主运动的经验，但对于这一次运动，都自觉地踊跃参加，对运动所赢得的辉煌的胜利，作出了卓越的贡献。
    由于1955年1月世界和平理事会通过维也纳宣言，和平签名运动扩大到全世界。维也纳宣言，不仅号召禁止原子弹和氢弹，而且号召反对准备原子战争，运动开始向前推进了一步。全世界反对准备原子战争的人民，热烈支持维也纳宣言。根据世界和平理事会的统计，签名总数已经超过了六亿五千万。中国有四亿人签了名，对整个运动作出了伟大的贡献。我们日本人民深为敬佩。除了维也纳宣言以外，在美国等其他国家也有禁止原子弹和氢弹的签名运动。如果把所有的数目计算在一起，估计签名总数将近七亿。群众运动有这样壮大规模的发展，真可以说是空前的了。
    签名运动有这样胜利的成就，我们当然高兴，但同时还要充分认识征集签名并非禁止原子弹和氢弹运动的目的，不过是它的准备阶段而已。这个运动，现在已经从征集签名的阶段进入了新的阶段。这个新阶段，就是要用表现在签名上面的全世界人民的力量，来推动各国政府走向禁止原子弹和氢弹的方向。一场政治上的搏斗正在开始。签名运动有没有结果，就要看是不是能够冲破坚硬的“政治的墙壁”而定。
    就日本而言，三千五百多万人的签名，已经逐步有了推动政治的力量。日本国会，尊重人民的舆论，两院都一致通过禁止原子弹氢弹的决议。鸠山政府的态度虽然并不积极，但同吉田茂内阁相比，首相
  和外相就不敢那么公开说要协助美国试验氢弹和原子弹了。这都是日本人民的力量。
    问题在于国际方面。当前的关键问题，是怎样在强行试验原子弹、氢弹的国际局势中，收到禁止原子弹和氢弹运动的效果；关于这个问题，苏联最高苏维埃通过决议，支持日本国会关于禁止原子弹和氢弹的决议，具有极其重大的意义。在苏联最高苏维埃的声明中，尤其是这一节特别值得我们重视：苏联最高苏维埃欢迎苏日两国人民关于禁止原子弹和氢弹问题的意见一致，并希望苏联和日本在这一崇高事业上的一致立场也将获得其他国家的议会的积极支持。
    美国在太平洋地区一再强行试验原子弹和氢弹，但最近也不得不开始重新审查这个问题。美国人民也要求禁止原子弹和氢弹。美国的国际法学家爱麦虞限·马戈里斯博士提出警告说：“只有停止违反国际法和人道主义原则的太平洋试验（指核子武器试验——译者注）才能维持美国的国际威信。”我们相信在爱好和平的美国人民的努力之下，美国政府总会有被迫修改原子弹和氢弹政策的一天。
    裁军问题，同禁止原子弹和氢弹密切相关。1955年6月，在赫尔辛基举行的世界和平大会上，规定每年8月6日为“反对原子武器斗争日”，决定在那一天，全世界一起要求完全禁止原子弹、氢弹和裁军。广岛遭受美国原子弹轰炸的那一天，已成为全世界的纪念日，尤其是在那一天，不但要求禁止原子弹和氢弹，而且要求裁军，这是很有意义的。国际局势正朝着这个方向发展。因此所有参加禁止原子弹和氢弹运动的和平活动家，必须正确理解这一点，把禁止原子弹和氢弹运动同裁军密切联系起来。
    第二届禁止原子弹和氢弹世界大会就是在这种国际局势之下举行的。8月6日举行东京大会，参加者有中国以及世界各
  国代表和日本人民约三万人，会上通过了东京宣言。这次东京大会，作为群众集会，获得了辉煌的成功。以这次大会的成功为基础，从8月9日起，在长崎召开了三天大会。
    这次长崎大会，参加者有日本全国各地代表约三千人，他们和世界各国代表一起彻底地讨论了禁止原子弹和氢弹问题，以及和它密切相关的裁军等问题。对于美国控制的重要原子弹和氢弹基地、冲绳岛的问题，也加以热烈讨论。讨论结果，通过长崎宣言和七项决议，并向全世界公开发表。这些宣言和决议，对于今后禁止原子弹和氢弹运动的前进方向，作出了具体指示。
    第二届禁止原子弹和氢弹世界大会并非是各国政府之间的会议，而是人民的会议，但也得到苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁、印度总理尼赫鲁以及其他世界各国首脑支持大会的贺电、贺词。尤其布尔加宁是保有原子弹和氢弹的大国苏联的领导人，他的贺电，给予我们日本人民莫大的鼓舞。
    这里想谈一谈原子弹和氢弹受害者的问题。我们要求禁止原子弹和氢弹，就不能忘记救助那些过去受到美国惨无人道的大规模杀人武器伤害的受害者。1955年8月第一届禁止原子弹和氢弹世界大会所通过的广岛宣言，向世界各国呼吁救助原子弹和氢弹受害者。世界各国和日本全国人民积极响应，伸出了温暖的手。特别是中国六人民团体（中国人民保卫世界和平委员会、中国红十字会总会、中国人民救济总会、中华全国总工会、中华全国民主妇女联合会、中华全国民主青年联合会），代表全中国人民，赠送慰问金人民币五万元，不仅原子弹和氢弹受害者深为感激，全日本人民一样感谢。这些慰问金，主要用于受害者的医疗和福利方面，一部分用于摄制纪录电影：“活下来是对的！”这部影片准备向世界各国和日本全国人民介绍原子弹和氢弹受害者的生活实况。
    这部影片命名的由来，是因为在第一届禁止原子弹和氢弹世界大会开会的时候，一位广岛原子弹受害姑娘，在群众热情关怀之下，情不自禁地说出这样一句话：“活下来是对的！”但是原子弹和氢弹受害者的现实生活还是非常悲惨的。不久以前，一位长崎原子弹受害姑娘失去了活命的希望，痛苦自杀。这位受害姑娘，在自杀的前夕，曾到长崎车站去欢迎过参加世界大会的各国代表。听说她自杀了，我立刻跑到她的家里，可是当我看到她的遗体的时候，我深深痛感我们的运动还没有足够的力量来阻止这种悲剧的产生，我觉得非常痛苦。我们一定要把运动深入开展，使一切原子弹和氢弹受害者从心里喊出：“活下来是对的！”因此我们一方面要在物质上无微不至地救助受害者，另一方面，要成为受害者的精神上的支柱。在第二届世界大会，中国六个人民团体，又赠送了慰问金人民币五万元，中国代表团代表还诚心诚意慰问了受害者。这个洋溢着中国人民深厚无比的友谊的行动，为救助受害者运动铺平了新的前进的道路。
    最后，我想再谈一个问题。我们日本人民，虽然强烈斥责美国试验和使用原子弹和氢弹，坚决要求禁止原子武器，但并没有忘记日本发动太平洋战争的责任。
    由于日本军国主义者发动了太平洋战争，给各国人民，特别是中国人民带来了巨大的损失，为此日本人民不得不深深反省、深深谢罪。为了战争，日本人民同样也受到难以言喻的灾难和痛苦。这些惨痛的切身的体验使日本人民对战争的看法根本改变了。太平洋战争使日本人民，尤其是家庭妇女和母亲们，发生了一次巨大的精神革命、一个不知不觉的和平革命。他们从心里自觉到，为了保卫人类的生命和幸福，为了保卫第二代的生命和幸福，绝对不能使战争再发生。日本和平运动，在战后能够蓬勃开展，它的基础就在这里。日本人民要求禁止原子弹和氢弹运动，是保卫和平运动的一个环节，当然我们并没有忘记了太平洋战争的责任。这次第二届禁止原子弹和氢弹世界大会的号召，也是以日本人民这种严肃的自我反省为基础的。
    我们日本人民，从心里愿望和缓亚洲紧张局势，巩固世界和平。这个愿望的先决条件，就是恢复中日两国的正常邦交。中国代表团参加禁止原子弹和氢弹世界大会，使中国人民和日本人民得到直接接触，是一个增进互相理解的好机会。以这个机会为起点，如果能够加强两国和平友好关系，那将是我们最大的愿望。
