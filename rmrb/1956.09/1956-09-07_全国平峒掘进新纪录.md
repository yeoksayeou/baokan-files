Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 4th – The South Mine Area of Zhongliangshan Coal Mine created a new national record in August for level tunneling in hard rock with a cross-section of 14 square meters: achieving a tunnel length of 200 meters. They tunneled 204.1 meters, lined 201.8 meters with masonry, and completed 202 meters of air walls and 202 meters of water ditches. All work processes for constructing the shaft with a level adit were carried out simultaneously. This achievement was obtained after the Zhongliangshan Coal Mine construction site adopted technical measures such as full excavation, multiple cycles, unified operations, and parallel operations.

After the Zhongliangshan Coal Mine construction site implemented the Soviet expert Batula's suggestion of full excavation in June, the tunneling progress increased from 51 meters in May to 145.9 meters in June and further to 152 meters in July. In terms of multiple cycles, it was done very systematically in August, and the cycle rate reached 100% except for three days in the latter part of the month when it was affected by water seepage. Therefore, production was also very balanced: 42.46% of the total monthly planned tasks were completed in the first ten days of the month, 41% in the middle ten days, and 36.62% in the last ten days despite being affected by water seepage for three days. Under the condition of balanced production, all work types exceeded the newly set quotas, ensuring engineering quality and operational safety, and reducing costs.

Zhongliangshan Coal Mine has surpassed the previous national record of 201 meters held by Sichuan Guangyuan Coal Mine in level tunneling, and has exceeded the previous national record of 164 meters held by Fuxin Mining Bureau in masonry lining.

    全国平峒掘进新纪录
    新华社重庆4日电　中梁山煤矿南井田8月份在断面十四平方公尺、坚硬岩石的平峒掘进中创造了成峒二百公尺的全国新纪录：掘进二百零四点一公尺，砌旋二百零一点八公尺，并且完成风墙二百零二公尺，水沟二百零二公尺。平巷建井的各项工序，都做到了齐头并进。这是中梁山煤矿工地采用全面开挖、多次循环、统一操作，以及平行作业等技术措施后获得的成就。
    今年6月份，中梁山煤矿工地贯彻了苏联专家巴楚拉的全面开挖的建议以后，掘进由5月份的五十一公尺提高到6月份的一百四十五点九公尺，7月份又提高到一百五十二公尺。在多次循环方面，8月份已经做得很正规，除了下旬有三天受渗水影响以外，循环率达到百分之百。因此，生产也十分均衡：上旬完成了全月计划任务的42.46％，中旬完成了41％，下旬虽然受渗水影响三天，仍然完成了36.62％。在均衡生产的情况下，各工种都突破了新定额；保证了工程质量和作业的安全；成本也降低了。
    中梁山煤矿在平峒掘进方面，已经超过了四川广元煤矿二百零一公尺的全国新纪录，在砌旋方面，已经超过了阜新矿务局一百六十四公尺的全国新纪录。
