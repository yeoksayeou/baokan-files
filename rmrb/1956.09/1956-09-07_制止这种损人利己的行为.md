    Curb This Selfish Behavior

    When I was traveling on official business from Luohe City, Henan Province, to Fuyang County, Anhui Province, I saw many livestock dealers and farmers who had bought livestock along the way. They mostly stayed at inns around eleven or twelve o'clock at night and set off again at two or three o'clock in the morning. On the surface, they seemed to be working very hard; but that is not the case. The main reason they do this is to engage in selfish behavior that harms others. It turns out that they find inns to rest in again at eleven or twelve o'clock during the day, and get up to walk again at three or four o'clock in the afternoon. When it gets dark, they let their livestock gorge themselves on beans and sweet potatoes before staying at an inn. In this way, they save on fodder costs, which is truly beneficial to both people and animals for them. However, this causes irreparable losses to the state and the agricultural cooperatives along the way. I suggest that relevant departments quickly curb this selfish and harmful behavior. Li Shutang

    制止这种损人利己的行为
    我因公从河南省漯河市出外到安徽省阜阳县去的时候，一路上看到了许多牲口贩和买了牲口的农民。他们大都是在夜里十一、二点钟才住店，早上两、三点钟就又赶路。表面上看来，他们好像是很辛苦的样子；其实不然。他们所以这样做，主要是为了做损人利己的事。原来，他们在白天十一、二点钟就又找店休息了，到下午三、四点钟起来再走；到天黑的时候，便让牲口在豆子、红薯地里大吃一饱，然后再住店。这样，把草料钱都省下了，对自己来说，真是人畜两利。可是，对国家和沿路的农业合作社却造成了不可弥补的损失。我建议有关部门迅速制止这种损人利己的不良行为。　李树堂
