    New Developments in the Greek Situation
    Shi Wei
    With the increasing relaxation of the international situation, Greece has experienced many noteworthy developments over the past year. Since the second half of last year, the Greek government has refused to participate in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's autumn military exercises and in some international conferences held by Western countries in Turkey. At the 10th United Nations General Assembly last year, Greece voted in favor of including the Algerian issue on the agenda. In July of this year, the Greek government announced that it would not accept aid from the U.S. and British governments for the Greek earthquake. In August, it expressed support for the Egyptian people's sovereignty over the Suez Canal and refused to participate in the London Conference discussing the Suez Canal. This series of actions by the Greek government, which Western officials have called "dangerous rifts," strikingly illustrates the significant changes that have taken place in the Greek situation in recent years.
    One of the most important features of Greece's domestic political situation over the past year has been the unprecedented strengthening of democratic and patriotic forces. This was clearly demonstrated in the general election in February of this year. During the election process, seven major opposition parties in Greece formed a united front called the "Democratic Union" to confront the ruling "National Radical Union." The Democratic Union included the Left-Wing Democratic Alliance, the Democratic Party, the Workers' Party, the Liberal Democratic Union, the Liberal Party, and the National Center Progressive Union. It was the first alliance formed by Greek opposition parties after the war, and its establishment marked the growth of Greek democratic and patriotic forces. Although the political programs of the various parties were not identical, they united under the banner of democracy and patriotism and put forward an election program that basically met the current Greek people's desire for peace and independent autonomy. This program called for defending national dignity and Greece's national sovereignty, implementing a truly independent foreign policy, pursuing a policy of "equal friendship" with Eastern and Western countries, supporting the struggle for the Cypriot people's right to self-determination, restoring a truly free and democratic national system, abolishing emergency measures and the exile of political prisoners, implementing amnesty and an equal proportional representation electoral system, and implementing an economic policy that would protect the Greek people from economic oligarchy exploitation.
    The great alliance of Greek patriotic and democratic forces has caused extreme consternation among some countries that adhere to the Cold War policy, and they have taken action to interfere in the development of the domestic situation in Greece. As the Greek newspaper "Ora" wrote when discussing this point: "The U.S. State Department is very disturbed by the development of the Greek situation, especially the establishment of an electoral alliance of opposition parties. The U.S. State Department has ordered its agencies to make every effort to split the alliance by various means, because this alliance is an obstacle to the implementation of American policy."
    Despite foreign interference, the results of the election showed that the Democratic Union's program was still supported by a majority of voters. The Democratic Union won more than 1,610,000 votes, while the National Radical Union won only more than 1,590,000 votes. However, due to the undemocratic electoral system, the National Radical Union won slightly more seats than the Democratic Union, and thus was able to continue in power. However, the strength of the Democratic Union inside and outside Parliament and the growth of the people's power cannot but have a significant impact on the current government's policies, increasingly pushing Greece to embark on a path of implementing more independent and autonomous policies in line with national interests.
    Six months ago, Greek public leader Doganis wrote: "Today, the overwhelming majority of the Greek people openly demand that Greece must withdraw from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and pursue a policy of national independence and neutrality." The Greek people know from their own experience that the result of implementing the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's policy is to invest half of their national expenditure in military uses, plunging the national economy into extremely difficult circumstances, bringing huge tax burdens and inflation, thereby making their already impoverished lives even worse. Even Greek Prime Minister Karamanlis admitted: "80% of our people are destitute."
    The Greek people know that implementing the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's policy also means that the independence of their motherland is seriously threatened. The Greek newspaper "Eleftheria" once wrote sadly: "Greek national independence is being ravaged and destroyed. The entire credit policy is controlled by foreigners and the Currency Committee, and the final decisions of the Currency Committee also depend on foreigners. Greece's fiscal policy is also subject to the will and instructions of the American delegation. The organization of the Greek armed forces and the level of Greek military expenditure depend on the opinions of the United States and the North Atlantic Alliance, which only value the number of divisions and ignore the living people." Therefore, the leader of the Greek Liberal Democratic Union and former Foreign Minister Venizelos said with emotion: "It seems that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization gives certain countries the rights of masters and imposes the obligations of slaves on other countries."
    The insults and oppression inflicted on Greece by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries on the Cyprus issue are particularly infuriating to the Greek people. Britain is carrying out brutal terror rule over the Greek residents on the island of Cyprus who are demanding national self-determination, while stubbornly refusing Greece's proposal to grant the Cypriot people the right to self-determination, and encouraging Turkey to launch anti-Greek riots. After the Suez Canal issue occurred, Britain further tightened its military suppression of Cyprus, and a large number of British and French troops gathered in Cyprus, turning the island into a forward base for launching armed intervention, regardless of the fate of the Cypriot people. This situation cannot but arouse great anger among the Greek people.
    Greece has also been subjected to crude pressure from the United States on the Cyprus issue. When Turkey stirred up anti-Greek atrocities last September, which led to a sharp deterioration in Greek-Turkish relations, Dulles threatened to cut off American aid to force Greece to stop its dispute with Turkey, demanding that it "unhesitatingly restore the unity of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization" and demanding that Greece cancel its decision not to participate in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization exercises. This attitude of the United States aroused strong dissatisfaction among the Greek people and various political parties. Liberal Party leader Venizelos pointed out: "Dulles's appeal is unprecedented in the history of diplomacy."
    Greece has twice submitted the Cyprus issue to the United Nations General Assembly for discussion. But each time it was met with pressure and obstruction from the British-American alliance. In the United Nations General Assembly, Greece can only obtain sympathy and support from countries outside the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. No wonder Prime Minister Karamanlis could not help but express his indignation, saying: "We cannot be regarded as poor relatives. We have our own national interests... It must be remembered that we are a nation."
    The Greek people have drawn conclusions from the lessons of reality. They know deeply that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is not an alliance of equality and freedom. In that alliance, small countries can only be manipulated by big countries. The Greek newspaper "Evening News" wrote: "We should leave the road we have been walking until now, because this road will deceive us. Now there is a broad road—a road of friendship with all countries. Austria, Yugoslavia, Egypt, the Arab countries, and India, so many countries are taking this road, why doesn't Greece take this road? If we take this road, we will be respected by all countries." These views reflect the growing desire of the Greek people to break away from military blocs and adopt an independent and autonomous foreign policy.
    In this situation, Greece has launched some independent diplomatic activities to improve its own international position and develop friendly relations with peace-loving countries. Recently, Greece has strengthened its relations with Yugoslavia, India, Egypt, and other Arab countries. The Greek government has formally invited Tito, Nehru, and Nasser to visit Greece. Greece's relations with the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries have also improved significantly. At present, Greece has restored normal diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania. Trade relations between Greece and the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries have been restored and expanded. At present, Greece has signed trade agreements with all the above-mentioned countries. Greek sources point out that if this trade is fully developed, socialist countries can accept one-third of Greece's total exports. This would be of great benefit in alleviating Greece's current economic difficulties. Cultural and friendly activities have also developed greatly in the past two years. Last year, cultural figures from Greece and the Soviet Union visited each other. Soviet Foreign Minister Shepilov's visit to Greece in June this year further advanced the relations between the two countries. A few days ago, a Greek cultural delegation arrived in Beijing and is now paying a friendly visit to our country. This is a good start to the friendly contact between China and Greece. These steps taken by Greece are conducive to the relaxation of the international situation, and also strengthen Greece's own independent position and enhance its international prestige.
    Greece is a civilized ancient country with a long history. As early as several centuries BC, Greece appeared a brilliant cultural era, its philosophy, literature, art, natural science reached a high level, for the development of human culture sowed immortal seeds. The people of the world still have been studying with great interest Homer, Aristophanes, Sophocles and other perfect poems and plays, studying the unique creation of the great Greek sculptors and architects, and think they are valuable heritage of mankind.
    During the Second World War, the Greek people rose up to fight back against the frenzied aggression of German fascism, organized a heroic resistance movement, and made important contributions to the Allied victory over the fascist struggle.
    Greece has an extremely glorious past and has made valuable contributions to mankind. Today, after deeply understanding the national disasters brought to them by following the imperialist countries' policies of arms expansion and war preparation, people from all walks of life in Greece are uniting under the banner of patriotism to fight for the independence and autonomy of their motherland. It can be foreseen that, as a country with a high degree of national self-esteem and an excellent cultural tradition, Greece, acting independently, will play an increasingly significant role in future international affairs.

    希腊局势的新发展
    施维
    随着国际局势的日趋和缓，一年来希腊出现了不少令人注意的情况。去年下半年以来，希腊政府曾经拒绝参加北大西洋集团的秋季军事演习；拒绝参加西方国家在土耳其召开的一些国际会议。在去年十届联合国大会上，希腊投票赞成将阿尔及利亚问题列入议程。今年7月，希腊政府宣布不接受美英政府对希腊地震的援助；8月它表示支持埃及人民对苏彝士运河的主权，并拒绝参加讨论苏彝士运河的伦敦会议。希腊政府这一连串被西方官员称为“危险的裂痕”的行动，突出地说明近年来希腊形势发生了重大的变化。
    一年来希腊国内政治形势最主要的特征之一是民主爱国力量的空前增强。这一点十分突出地表现在今年2月间的大选上。在选举过程中，希腊在野的七个主要党派结成了一个叫作“民主联盟”的统一战线，同执政的“国民激进联盟”抗衡。民主联盟包括左翼民主联盟、民主党、工人党、自由民主联盟、自由党和全国中派进步联盟。它是希腊在野党派战后第一次结成的联盟，它的成立标志着希腊民主爱国力量的增长。虽然各党派政治纲领并不相同，但是在民主爱国的旗帜下团结起来，提出了一个基本上符合当前希腊人民要求和平和独立自主的愿望的竞选纲领。这个纲领要求保卫民族尊严和希腊的国家主权，实行真正独立的外交政策，同东西方国家实行“平等友谊”的政策，支持塞浦路斯民族自决权的斗争，恢复真正自由民主的国家制度，取消紧急状态和流放政治犯的措施，实行大赦和平等的比例选举制，执行希腊人民不受经济寡头剥削的经济政策等。
    希腊爱国民主力量的大联合，引起了一些坚持冷战政策的国家的极度惊慌，它们采取行动来干涉希腊国内局势的发展。希腊“奥拉报”在谈到这点时写道：“美国国务院对希腊局势的发展，主要是对在野党选举联盟的成立感到非常不安。美国国务院曾命令它的机构竭力用各种办法来分裂这个联盟，因为这个联盟是实行美国政策的障碍。”
    尽管有外来的干涉，大选的结果显示民主联盟的纲领还是获得了多数选民的拥护。民主联盟获得一百六十一万多选票，国民激进联盟只获得一百五十九万多选票。但由于不民主的选举制度，国民激进联盟得到的议席却略多于民主联盟，因而得以继续执政。但是民主联盟在议会内外力量的强大以及人民群众力量的增长就不能不对现政府的政策发生重大的影响，日益推使希腊走上执行更加符合民族利益的独立自主政策的道路。
    半年前希腊公众领袖道格尼斯写道：“今天希腊压倒多数的人民都公开要求希腊必须退出北大西洋集团，执行一种国家独立和中立的政策。”希腊人民从他们亲身的体验中知道，执行北大西洋集团政策的结果是把他们国家开支的一半投入军事用途中，使国民经济陷入极其困难的境地，带来巨大捐税负担和通货膨胀，从而使得他们本来就贫困的生活更加恶化。连希腊首相卡拉曼利斯也承认：“我们的80％的人民是一贫如洗的。”
    希腊人民知道执行北大西洋集团的政策还意味着他们祖国的独立受到严重威胁。希腊“自由报”曾经沉痛地写道：“希腊民族独立正在遭受到蹂躏和破坏。整个信贷政策都控制在外国人和货币委员会的手里，而货币委员会的最后决议也取决于外国人。希腊的财政政策也是以美国代表团的意志和指示为转移的。希腊武装部队的组织和希腊军事开支的水平取决于美国和北大西洋联盟的意见，它们的意见只重视师团的数目而不顾有生命的人。”所以希腊自由民主联盟领袖，前外交大臣维尼齐洛斯感慨地说道：“好像北大西洋公约组织以主宰者的权利给予某些国家，并且以奴隶的义务强加在另外一些国家身上。”
    北大西洋集团国家在塞浦路斯问题上给予希腊的侮辱和压迫特别使希腊人民感到愤慨。英国对塞浦路斯岛上要求民族自决的希腊居民施行残暴的恐怖统治，同时顽固地拒绝希腊提出的给予塞浦路斯人民自决权利的建议，并且鼓励土耳其发动反希腊的骚动。苏彝士运河问题发生以后，英国更加紧对塞浦路斯的军事镇压，大批英法军队集结在塞浦路斯，把这个岛变成发动武装干涉的前哨阵地，置塞浦路斯人民的命运于不顾。这种情形不能不引起希腊人民极大的愤怒。
    希腊在塞浦路斯问题上也受到了美国粗暴的压力。去年9月土耳其煽起反希腊的暴行事件，使得希土关系急剧恶化，当时杜勒斯曾以中断美援来要挟希腊停止同土耳其的争执，要求“毫不迟疑地恢复北大西洋公约组织的团结”，并要求希腊取消不参加北大西洋集团演习的决定。美国这个态度激起了希腊人民和各政党的强烈不满。自由党领袖维尼齐洛斯指出：“杜勒斯的呼吁是外交史上空前的”。
    希腊曾两次将塞浦路斯问题提交联合国大会讨论。但每次都遭到英美联合的压力和阻挠。希腊在联合国大会上只能从北大西洋集团以外的国家那里得到同情和支持。怪不得卡拉曼利斯首相也不能不表示愤慨说：“不能够把我们当作穷亲戚看待。我们有我们自己的国家的利益……。必须记住，我们是一个民族。”
    希腊人民从现实的教训中得出了结论，他们深知北大西洋集团并不是一个什么平等自由的联盟，在那个联盟里小国只能任由大国摆布。希腊“新闻晚报”曾写道：“我们应该离开直到现在我们所走的道路，因为这条道路将会使我们受骗。现在有着一条宽广的道路——同所有国家友好的道路。奥地利、南斯拉夫、埃及、阿拉伯国家以及印度这许多国家都在走这条道路，为什么希腊不走这条道路呢？如果我们走这条道路，我们就将受到所有国家的尊重。”这些主张反映了希腊人民要求摆脱军事集团、采取独立自主的外交政策的日益增强的愿望。
    在这种情况下，希腊展开了一些独立的外交活动，来改善它自己的国际地位，发展同爱好和平国家的友好关系。最近以来，希腊加强了同南斯拉夫、印度、埃及以及其他阿拉伯国家的关系。希腊政府已正式邀请铁托、尼赫鲁、纳赛尔访希。希腊同苏联和人民民主国家的关系也有了显著的改进。目前希腊和苏、波、捷、保、匈、罗已恢复正常外交关系。希腊同苏联和人民民主国家的贸易关系恢复和扩大起来，目前希腊同上述几个国家都签订有贸易协定。希腊人士指出，如果这种贸易充分发展起来，社会主义国家可以受纳希腊出口总额的三分之一。这对解脱目前希腊的经济困难会有很大的好处。文化友好活动两年来也有了很大的开展。去年希腊和苏联两国文化人士进行了互相访问。今年6月苏联外交部长谢皮洛夫访希，更使两国关系向前推进一步。几天以前，一个希腊文化代表团到达北京，现在正在我国进行友好访问。这是中希两国友好接触的一个良好开端。希腊采取的这些步骤有助于国际局势的缓和，也加强了希腊自己的独立地位，提高了它的国际威信。
    希腊是一个有悠久历史的文明古国。早在公元前几世纪，希腊就出现了一个光辉灿烂的文化时代，它的哲学、文学、艺术、自然科学达到高度水平，为人类文化的发展播下了不朽的种子。全世界人民至今还一直怀着很大的兴趣来研读荷马、亚理斯多芬、索福克莱斯等人完美的诗篇和戏剧，研究希腊伟大的雕刻家和建筑师独特的创作，并且认为它们都是人类宝贵的遗产。
    第二次世界大战期间、希腊人民曾奋起反击德国法西斯的疯狂侵略，组织了英勇的抵抗运动，对于盟国战胜法西斯的斗争作出了重要的贡献。
    希腊有着极其光荣的过去，对人类作过宝贵的贡献。今天希腊各界人民在深刻体会到追随帝国主义国家扩军备战政策所给他们带来的民族灾难之后，正在爱国的旗帜下团结起来为祖国的独立自主进行斗争。可以预见到，作为一个有高度民族自尊心和优秀文化传统的国家，独立地行动起来的希腊将在未来的国际事务中起日益显著的作用。
