The Development of Bulgarian Industry
Bulgaria Ku Bietelov

    It has been twelve years since the Bulgarian people freed themselves from the oppression of the fascist monarchy and embarked on a new path of economic and political development. In this short historical period, profound changes have taken place in all aspects of our country's life.

    In the past, Bulgaria did not have an industry capable of meeting the urgent needs of the people. The Bulgarian bourgeoisie acted as vassals of the world's capitalist monopolies. The real masters of Bulgarian industry were German, French, and Belgian capitalists. The share of foreign investment was 48.3% in large-scale industry, 91% in cement production, 85% in sugar and match production, 65% in the tobacco industry, and so on. For a long time, our country became an investment site for foreign capital, a dumping market for commodities, and a source of cheap agricultural raw materials—an agricultural appendage of imperialist Germany.

    Some people's democratic countries, such as Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Poland, inherited relatively developed industries from the legacy of the old era. Bulgaria, however, did not inherit even one large heavy industrial enterprise. Therefore, our people had to build heavy industry themselves after becoming masters of their own house.

    The Party and the government first focused on restoring production in enterprises that had ceased operations during the war. To accomplish this task, the resistance of the capitalists had to be overcome. These capitalists tried to maintain and deepen the damage suffered by the country, hoping to incite popular dissatisfaction with the people's government.

    After the nationalization of industrial enterprises and banks at the end of 1947, our country's industry began to develop rapidly. Only then was it possible to begin establishing heavy industry and its heart—machine manufacturing. To fully meet the country's growing need for electricity, the power base had to be expanded.

    Vigorous construction began. To implement the instructions of the Fifth Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party on national industrialization, our people overcame all difficulties with unprecedented enthusiasm. Important industrial buildings rose one after another. In the period from 1949 to 1952 alone, more than 700 new factories were built, rebuilt, and put into production, including the Stalin Chemical Combine and its thermal power station, the Red Star Machine Factory and the Kirkov Machine Factory, the Telman Cotton Mill, the Halachev Textile Factory, and so on. Bulgaria's first artificial reservoir, the Kolarov Reservoir, has also been completed.

    Naturally, many difficulties were encountered during this large-scale construction in our country. However, these difficulties were overcome thanks to the fraternal assistance of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. Soviet experts have extended a helping hand to Bulgarian builders more than once. They have trained many Bulgarian specialists who are now able to undertake complex assembly work.

    The smooth progress of our country's industrial construction was greatly hindered by the shortage of electricity supply. At the end of World War II, Bulgaria's total generating capacity was only 105,408 kilowatts, with an annual electricity generation of 320 million kilowatt-hours. The electricity needed for new factories, newly emerging cities, and rural electrification was much greater than this amount. Therefore, power stations were built at an accelerated pace, primarily thermal power stations burning low-quality coal. However, the country's need for electricity continued to grow. The shortage of electricity sometimes manifested itself acutely. However, this difficulty was also overcome. Now, the total generating capacity of our country's power stations is 590,000 kilowatts, with an annual electricity generation of 2,185 million kilowatt-hours. The per capita electricity generation has increased sixfold. In the next two to three years, it is planned to build some new hydroelectric and thermal power stations, as well as small diesel power stations, with a total generating capacity of more than 440,000 kilowatts. There is no doubt that this will promote the further development of Bulgarian industry.

    In the twelve years since liberation, and in fact, during the recent seven or eight years, our industry has undergone fundamental changes. We have now established our own heavy industry. Machine manufacturing, the coal industry, mining, and the chemical industry have all developed greatly. The ferrous and non-ferrous metallurgy industries are also developing. Three years have passed since our country's first metallurgical plant, the Lenin National Metallurgical Plant, was put into production. The first phase of the lead-zinc plant has been in operation for a year. The second phase of its project will also be completed in a short period of time and begin producing lead.

    Bulgaria's formerly notorious backwardness is gone forever. Many new factories are equipped with Bulgarian-produced machines. In the cooperative fields, alongside Soviet agricultural machinery, more and more Bulgarian-made agricultural machines are appearing. Not long ago, Bulgaria could only export agricultural products and raw materials. Now it is completely different! In 1955, 44.5% of our country's exports were industrial products.

    Although not as experienced as other countries in industrial production, Bulgaria's machine manufacturers, chemical and electrical industry workers have also produced products that can compete with foreign goods in terms of quality and appearance.

    In the past few years, light industry and the food industry have been fundamentally rebuilt, expanded, and modernized. Now, our country's production of several daily necessities has surpassed many industrially developed countries. In 1955, on a per capita basis, our country could obtain 17.5 meters of cotton fabric, 8.3 kilograms of sugar, and 14.6 kilograms of meat and meat products.

    In addition to quantitative growth, Bulgarian industrial production has also made significant achievements in expanding product varieties and improving product quality. For example, the textile industry produces more than 600 patterns and 900 colors of cotton fabrics, 59 varieties and 1,850 colors of woolen fabrics, and 170 varieties and 720 colors of silk fabrics.

    In 1939, the ratio of industrial and agricultural output was: industry accounting for 33.8% and agriculture accounting for 66.2%; in 1952, this ratio was very different: industry accounted for 66.6% and agriculture accounted for 33.4%. The trend of decreasing agricultural proportion and increasing industrial proportion will continue to develop in the future. The proportion of the first category—the production of means of production—in industrial production is also increasing. At the same time, due to collectivization, mechanization, and the adoption of the latest agronomic methods, the absolute quantity of agricultural production has also increased significantly.

    The figures quoted above undoubtedly prove that Bulgaria, which was once a backward agricultural country, has become an industrial-agricultural country. But we will never stop at the level we have already reached. In the future, Bulgaria will develop those industrial sectors that have abundant raw material bases in our country, rather than establishing those industrial sectors that are not cost-effective under our conditions. The industrial construction and production cooperation between people's democratic countries provide great possibilities for the economic prosperity of the socialist camp countries and for improving the material and cultural living standards of the people of these countries, including our own.

    保加利亚工业的发展
    保加利亚　库·别特洛夫
    自从保加利亚人民摆脱了法西斯保皇政权的压迫，在经济和政治发展中走上新的道路以来，已经有十二年过去了。在这个短短的历史时期内，我国生活的各个方面都发生了深刻的变化。
    过去，保加利亚没有能以满足人民迫切需要的工业。保加利亚的资产阶级充当了世界资本主义垄断组织代理人的附庸。保加利亚工业的真正主宰是德国以及法国和比利时的资本家。外国投资所占的份额，在大工业中是48.3％，在水泥的生产中是91％，在糖和火柴的生产中是85％，在制烟工业中是65％，等等。长时期内，我国成为外国资本的投资场所和商品倾销市场，成为廉价的农业原料来源——帝国主义德国的农业附属品。
    有些人民民主国家，如捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、波兰，都从旧时代遗产中得到了比较发达的工业。而保加利亚却连一个大的重工业企业也没有承继下来。因此，我国人民不得不在当家作主以后自己动手来建立重工业。
    党和政府首先关心的是使在战时停工的企业恢复生产。要完成这个任务，就得克服资本家的反抗。这些资本家力图保持并加深国家所遭受到的破坏，想以此引起人民群众对人民政权的不满。
    在1947年年底实行了工业企业和银行的国有化以后，我国的工业开始迅速地发展起来。这时才有可能着手建立重工业及其心脏——机器制造业。为了充分满足全国对电力的日益增长的需要，必须扩大电力基地。
    蓬勃的建设开始了。为了执行保加利亚共产党第五次代表大会关于国家工业化的指示，我国人民以空前的热情克服了一切困难。重要的工业建筑物一个接一个耸立起来。仅在从1949年到1952年期间，新建、重建并投入生产的工厂就有七百多个，其中有斯大林化学联合工厂和该厂所属的热电站，红星机器制造厂和基尔科夫机器制造厂、台尔曼棉纺厂、哈拉切夫纺织厂等等。保加利亚的第一个人造水库——科拉罗夫水库也已经建成。
    自然，在我国进行这种大规模建设的时候，也遇到了不少困难。但是由于苏联和人民民主国家的兄弟般的援助，这些困难都克服了。苏联专家不止一次地向保加利亚的建设者伸出援手。他们培养出了许多保加利亚本国的专门人材，这些人现在都能担负复杂的装配工作了。
    我国工业建设的顺利进展由于电力供应的不足而受到很大的阻碍。在第二次世界大战末期，保加利亚的发电能力总共只有十万零五千四百零八瓩，每年发电量为三亿二千万度。新工厂、新出现的城市和农村电气化所需要的电力，要比这个数量多得多。因此，以加快的速度建立了电力站，首先是燃用劣质煤的火电站。但是国家对电力的需要在继续增长。电力不足的情况有时表现得很尖锐。可是，这个困难也克服了。现在我国发电站的总发电能力为五十九万瓩，年发电量为二十一亿八千五百万度。按人口平均，发电量增加了六倍。今后两三年内，计划建设一些新的水电站和火电站，以及小型的柴油发电站，总的发电能力在四十四万瓩以上。毫无疑问，这将促进保加利亚工业的进一步发展。
    解放后，十二年来，实际上是在最近七、八年期间，我们的工业发生了根本的变化。现在我们已建立了自己的重工业。机器制造业、煤炭工业、采矿业和化学工业，都有了很大的发展。黑色和有色冶金业也正在发展。从我国第一个冶金工厂——列宁国家冶金工厂投入生产以来已经过去了三年。铅锌工厂第一期工程投入生产已有一年了。它的第二期工程在短时期内也就要结束并开始出铅。
    保加利亚从前出名的落后性已经一去不返。许多新工厂安装了保加利亚出产的机器。在合作社的田野上，在苏联农业机器的旁边，愈来愈多地出现了保加利亚制造的农业机器。不久以前，保加利亚还只能输出农产品和原料。现在完全不同了！1955年，我国出口物资的44.5％是工业品。
    虽然不像别的国家在工业生产方面有丰富的经验，可是保加利亚的机器制造者、化学和电机工业工人也为国家制出了在质量和外观上都能与外国货并驾齐驱的产品。
    过去几年，轻工业和食品工业已从根本上实行了改建、扩建和现代化。现在我国有几种日用品的生产已赶过许多工业发达的国家。1955年，按人口平均计算，我国每人可以得到十七公尺半的棉织品，八点三公斤糖，十四点六公斤肉和肉制品。
    除了数量上的增长以外，保加利亚的工业生产在扩大产品种类和提高产品质量方面也取得了显著成就。例如，纺织工业生产的棉织品有六百多种花样和九百多种颜色，毛织品有五十九种品种、一千八百五十种花色，丝织品有一百七十种品种，七百二十种花色。
    1939年，工、农业产量的比重是：工业占33.8％，农业占66.2％；1952年，这个比例已经大大不同：工业是66.6％，农业是33.4％。农业比重下降和工业比重上升的趋势，今后仍会继续发展。第一部类——生产资料的生产在工业生产中的比重也在增加。同时由于合作化、机械化和采用最新农艺方法的结果，农业生产的绝对数量也有了显著的增长。
    上面引用的数字无疑地证明，过去曾是一个落后的农业国的保加利亚，已经变成了一个工业—农业国。但我们决不停留在已经达到的水平上。将来，保加利亚要发展那些在我国拥有丰富的原料基地的工业部门，而不必去建立那些在我们的条件下并不合算的工业部门。人民民主国家间进行的工业建设和生产上的协作，为社会主义阵营各国的经济繁荣、为提高这些国家（包括我国）人民的物质和文化生活水平，提供了巨大的可能性。（本报特约稿）（附图片）
