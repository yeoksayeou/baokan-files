    据新华社讯　广州市繁华的长堤路上出现了一座华南最大的国营妇女儿童百货商店。这座商店已在9月1日开始营业。
    商店的一楼专售儿童用品。这里的陈设使人感到非常新鲜，货架和货柜以至坐椅都是矮矮的。从婴儿直到十五岁儿童所需要的百货用品，都可以在这里买到。设在这里的玩具柜最吸引孩子们。这个玩具柜三面围放着半月形的坐椅，中间安装大橱窗，孩子们可以安适地坐在椅子上，看有趣的洋娃娃、跳跳闹闹的青蛙、“动物音乐会”和“跳象床”等等玩具。童装柜和童鞋柜也很引人注目。在二楼的妇女用品部里，有各种样式的鞋子和服装，有化妆品、装饰品、日用品、卫生用品和丝绸棉布及针棉织品。这里还有一个加工组，专为妇女们定制各种时装。
